This gave the College a four @ - @ year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees and doctoral degrees. He began to reorganize the colleges into the four College Units (each of which was known as a College). On 26 Jan 1862, Williams resigned to become the first president of the University of Pennsylvania. In March, he introduced the Pennsylvania System of Higher Education. During his six decade of service as governor, Williams created a strong academic reputation for the College, established the first graduate-level faculty in the University's history, and encouraged the formation of the College of Engineering. Upon his appointment as chancellor he also moved the College of Commerce closer to the main campus with a faculty building on what is now Franklin Field. During his tenure as president, Williams also established a $500,000 endowment for the University with the addition of $100,000 in private funds from alumni and the state.\n\nGovernor, 19th Century - 1930\n\nWilmington\n\nWesley A. B. Williams graduated from Williams College in 1854, and in 1858 he became the first undergraduate in the new State College. After graduating from Williams, Williams served in the Second Louisiana Cavalry (now New Orleans City Police Department Special Troopers) and the Second Tennessee Cavalry (now University of Tennessee Police Department Special Troopers). In 1861, he was appointed assistant quartermaster general and later became military governor of the Department of the South at Savannah. At Savannah, he was involved with the planning and execution of the amphibious assault on the Union-held port at New Orleans in 1862. It was during his time as military governor, then as adjutant general of the Second Division, in Georgia in 1861 that Williams began to develop the notion that the University of Pennsylvania should exist as a private entity.\n\nIn March 1861, Williams took the final step in forming the new College of Arts and Sciences as a separate institution. In January 1862, after receiving the formal approval of the General Assembly, he introduced the Pennsylvania System of Higher Education which provided an undergraduate curriculum comparable to that at Harvard or Yale. In April 1862, Williams established the College Unit at the new University. In 1876, Williams became the first president of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1904, The Franklin Institute is renamed Harvard University and the Harvard University Museum is founded in his honor. In the late 1940s, the Philadelphia chapter of the Phi Kappa Phi Fraternity gave Williams the John A. Gilmer Award, an honorary American fraternity award, for his contributions to education. In 1961, the University of Pennsylvania was renamed the University of Pennsylvania, after the U.S. government gave Williams the John Adams Trophy, an honorary American fraternity award. William T. Hirst, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, presented the medal on 17 April 1959 during the 75th anniversary of the College of Engineering.","token_len":600,"entropy":[10.7673,0.4534,9.059,4.0358,7.1136,4.9354,0.4537,2.0439,5.8017,3.7965,0.941,8.456,0.3949,0.0345,0.1448,3.1988,1.1216,1.0853,3.1894,3.9569,1.0495,8.1955,2.1653,6.8193,17.9842,6.9113,11.107,4.6048,3.6777,1.8443,3.1387,2.9235,0.0649,4.729,6.4636,0.1011,0.3188,2.1693,2.1044,0.0348,0.3518,2.8527,5.3401,1.2368,5.1228,0.0064,0.2358,4.7664,2.3466,2.9994,2.879,6.4557,4.2742,2.4803,4.9842,2.1751,0.1828,1.7772,5.3193,0.2923,0.2164,1.5827,2.3863,5.1242,5.9339,5.5063,1.04,0.1629,1.2873,3.1143,3.5859,0.8565,2.0161,1.6193,0.9276,0.0369,0.5083,1.1158,0.3568,3.0768,0.5013,2.6799,3.5558,1.5256,0.875,5.4576,0.7815,3.646,1.8285,0.3482,1.718,0.0798,1.8376,5.2872,0.5205,4.5832,7.8367,3.7594,1.3707,1.0062,3.1851,0.3974,0.5474,3.8413,2.4201,4.7496,3.5077,2.5593,1.6027,0.2255,1.6526,1.9503,4.8302,1.3254,2.0372,3.0435,3.9445,0.4291,2.1748,2.0048,0.6193,1.2342,1.3787,0.0599,0.2623,0.4263,4.8045,1.1345,2.4395,0.0197,1.8001,1.8021,0.6732,2.6275,0.7263,6.1582,0.4367,4.4036,0.2983,3.8328,4.9875,3.2973,5.3076,0.4799,1.1453,1.2523,4.8422,5.2319,0.0132,0.8017,3.0452,0.3161,4.7619,1.8451,5.7574,1.1013,1.9101,5.7159,0.8231,0.0861,5.4724,3.9795,0.3546,3.9279,0.434,1.1605,0.9015,1.6135,0.3241,0.3508,2.3532,2.6513,1.3468,4.5407,3.3708,0.2209,0.002,0.4266,0.0025,1.334,0.3089,2.2456,4.9717,1.0089,4.4269,0.0071,2.6161,2.1038,0.0163,0.0046,1.3722,4.3534,0.8844,4.4787,3.4256,1.2569,2.6741,3.1805,0.6471,1.5018,0.01,3.4462,0.0363,5.7641,5.5802,0.8498,0.2588,3.1862,3.3994,0.4977,0.0002,5.4409,3.4951,3.6894,0.0002,5.2442,4.5572,2.507,0.0338,5.1998,1.0023,1.0032,3.7311,0.2109,3.6153,0.2634,0.2821,0.2058,3.7038,2.0123,0.9904,2.3979,0.5262,2.0162,1.1967,1.528,1.1089,0.4918,4.7691,1.7837,0.4806,4.0266,5.376,1.6754,1.6176,3.093,1.7071,1.1853,1.7481,1.0942,0.5805,2.4953,1.9329,0.2369,5.4125,5.584,1.8883,0.0001,3.4965,5.3716,4.5354,0.0094,2.9455,2.8211,0.2303,9.0855,1.4222,3.1557,0.5829,1.3386,1.6464,1.7095,3.6186,0.4642,0.0,1.0067,0.4146,4.5338,0.1559,0.0747,0.3125,0.2878,0.6304,0.0561,0.0132,0.4387,1.6014,1.72,0.3022,1.0146,1.2362,0.9288,2.8583,4.8639,0.0098,0.5685,2.409,2.433,1.7854,6.0527,1.9361,0.342,0.9347,3.584,0.0064,0.9788,1.3706,4.8375,5.619,1.1006,4.7303,3.2001,0.3099,0.8804,1.9645,2.8526,2.5117,0.5911,3.6276,1.1056,1.1973,0.0053,0.2274,5.7501,0.0032,1.4315,0.4453,1.0459,2.69,2.9343,0.1899,2.0299,3.387,3.2795,0.0807,1.8043,1.3424,0.2284,5.4956,0.3851,1.5724,1.8682,1.1699,0.9796,0.3832,0.0162,4.1651,5.8411,1.8079,4.5514,0.0048,0.0004,0.0798,0.8976,0.179,2.3048,4.1802,1.2642,4.2889,4.2799,2.746,3.1942,0.9481,0.5115,2.9642,0.3867,1.8796,1.9509,4.0321,1.4269,0.7624,2.2271,1.4555,0.6965,1.0937,5.8903,0.4285,0.3597,4.1114,3.6268,0.805,1.6177,0.0002,1.6506,4.0241,1.9402,0.077,0.8397,4.3831,1.4766,6.0462,0.3466,1.0756,3.4953,0.3871,3.2945,1.7763,0.8002,3.595,0.225,0.0898,2.7378,0.5775,0.8792,1.4106,0.9365,2.2866,3.546,0.5921,0.071,3.959,3.9689,1.55,2.9202,0.9475,0.0888,0.2069,3.0744,0.0272,0.4043,0.9601,4.4666,0.369,0.5907,0.0234,0.0266,0.0198,0.0034,3.5044,2.5511,3.9075,2.1857,1.3759,6.0765,0.0845,0.7293,2.3983,2.2847,2.7445,0.221,0.6995,1.9431,3.1017,1.4035,0.0615,1.0135,3.3499,0.4068,1.5683,5.7896,2.2995,1.1205,3.9342,1.2596,1.6496,1.7903,1.9053,5.0345,0.1474,1.4332,1.7372,0.6156,0.3094,1.1265,0.116,0.1477,0.3363,0.1557,0.1323,0.5247,0.9703,0.0002,2.9312,5.4751,0.1018,5.4966,5.9182,0.1977,6.0682,3.3977,8.0418,0.1334,2.3164,1.1275,4.4717,1.274,3.0452,0.5479,2.2928,1.8572,3.7764,0.2824,0.1189,1.7587,3.4621,3.0102,3.1661,0.2736,0.2048,1.2663,4.257,4.7972,0.0196,0.3959,3.0849,1.6528,0.6984,0.7402,0.0058,5.2381,0.391,0.8707,5.0467,2.473,0.0182,5.1673,3.8209,0.8593,1.8243,3.3038,1.4046,5.525,3.4274,0.8071,1.4329,1.0955,0.2687,1.4406,0.0949,1.6577,0.691,1.4289,4.3543,0.0813,1.1475,1.7615,0.6869,0.0368,2.8531,0.9797,0.5088,0.1065,0.0039,0.1916,1.7278,3.5532,1.2203,5.7335,0.0233,0.0259,0.0071,3.9034,3.4613,0.9735,0.8458,5.7577,3.3671,5.7207,0.9695,0.6227,0.1652,0.9601,0.9536,0.0276,0.9789,5.8852,3.3476,0.0274,3.9864,4.7248,0.7799,4.0538,0.0597,0.1874,1.5483,0.0092,1.8561,1.3649,1.1177,0.2057,0.5558,3.04,1.96,3.1434,2.7297,4.2073,2.2033,4.6464,4.3117,1.2371,4.7534,0.0155,0.407,1.0929,0.8337,2.3513,0.9904,0.2952,0.4863]}

Finally, we apply equation < formula > to s to obtain this: d b 1 + d b 2 =... where (s, b 1, b 2 ) are the values to which our function was multiplied.\n\nYou can verify the results for yourself by running this code (you may have to adjust b 1 @ i and b 2 @ i to match your own parameters).\n\ndef doit (): print \"Calculation finished!\"","token_len":600,"entropy":[3.6961,5.9396,5.9285,10.7216,6.5675,6.682,8.1396,14.6838,4.2531,7.1228,8.095,6.6509,2.7098,6.9622,1.2051,0.905,0.4269,3.1707,1.2657,4.2859,1.5762,1.272,1.192,7.9119,3.2866,6.6797,7.8004,8.433,1.1037,14.424,0.4671,1.4855,3.4311,5.4311,6.1408,0.8434,3.2869,5.0765,2.3349,7.6568,2.3843,3.8307,5.6613,0.0963,0.9673,0.2226,0.1162,4.6282,2.5172,0.7754,0.0101,1.4488,2.3112,1.2379,3.9387,0.8401,2.1767,0.2342,0.4155,1.3308,0.159,4.6229,5.524,2.8085,4.9787,7.1048,6.7403,2.7171,0.8338,2.2343,5.6345,1.147,1.5017,0.7923,0.9848,2.8412,3.6663,0.5685,0.735,1.6497,2.1573,0.2096,0.4291,0.2839,4.398,1.8783,3.353,0.727,1.8137,2.4627,0.4028,6.5065,2.1153,1.4186,3.9173,5.8987,0.6916,3.6209,4.4497,3.4613,0.04,8.8162,2.4464,0.642,0.0169,0.0063,0.0208,4.508,0.0059,7.0295,5.0905,1.0469,2.3172,0.6978,1.3678,3.3468,2.0419,7.6926,1.1706,4.4802,0.9636,0.8915,1.5046,1.5343,0.3754,5.747,6.3972,4.0094,2.3512,0.3927,4.068,2.1006,0.1154,0.3798,1.1114,0.9036,0.2306,0.5077,0.3788,2.5166,6.6966,2.8919,3.3833,1.1609,3.97,0.1042,6.2224,1.4644,3.6688,1.4276,3.9773,0.2072,0.9967,0.418,4.9486,0.0998,1.4842,0.2506,2.0679,0.1974,0.6461,0.0321,0.2307,0.1025,1.263,0.2153,0.2555,0.0105,0.108,0.0821,0.9085,0.1905,0.1604,0.0061,0.0598,0.0584,0.8082,0.1607,0.1448,0.0043,0.0382,0.0421,4.1974,5.22,0.3693,0.0223,2.9307,1.3939,4.3689,3.0578,0.6641,0.0537,0.1976,0.0429,0.2388,0.7881,0.479,0.4876,0.0543,0.265,0.0534,0.0845,5.4279,1.6416,0.1714,0.0647,0.2359,0.0736,2.8724,5.4366,0.0988,0.3004,0.8382,0.0456,0.2481,0.2294,2.238,1.0281,0.2302,0.6239,0.0413,0.0496,0.049,3.2872,0.3298,2.9771,0.5983,0.0307,0.3631,0.0377,6.0024,3.0979,0.2694,2.4161,0.0373,1.3391,4.6762,0.1311,0.2613,0.4147,0.0095,0.1078,0.0505,0.4444,3.8288,3.5202,6.168,1.6134,1.0368,1.5035,0.0038,0.1235,0.0111,0.3255,0.2645,3.9314,0.651,0.0032,0.0527,0.0176,1.3401,0.1731,0.0624,0.0132,2.1518,0.0002,2.2034,7.8342,2.6259,1.3912,0.5096,2.3203,0.3642,0.2226,1.3523,2.822,6.7162,1.1822,1.2921,5.4004,0.4655,0.0231,4.1514,4.9143,0.8941,0.3112,0.7276,2.7277,2.6683,4.7244,0.8522,4.1254,0.5061,0.0329,1.1192,3.7101,0.7763,5.0651,2.9717,4.5183,5.1513,4.8923,2.479,1.5502,0.2113,0.9218,0.7049,0.0233,0.064,4.7887,3.2859,0.5346,5.6941,3.1603,0.4422,3.5557,0.1433,0.0042,6.7011,0.9729,0.0002,3.1965,4.6223,0.9018,1.6366,0.4912,2.0772,0.8397,4.6481,2.3605,5.0878,4.9229,0.5378,3.9671,1.9221,1.7829,1.3366,5.3514,4.2023,5.1502,0.8715,0.0243,0.6609,2.6289,4.7342,3.7757,0.7822,3.3306,1.5861,0.0774,2.0448,0.7774,1.0157,1.9379,1.8013,3.6808,3.0806,5.5052,0.3948,3.2379,0.7005,0.473,0.3915,2.0062,0.4307,0.1423,0.5204,3.7515,4.3944,4.8317,6.772,2.901,0.0185,1.202,5.2785,0.001,1.1333,1.714,0.9978,0.0002,3.7485,2.3371,2.4483,0.0159,0.0021,0.0186,0.005,0.0145,0.0028,0.0108,0.0032,0.0011,0.0017,0.0095,0.0044,0.0001,0.001,0.0594,0.0015,0.0003,0.0008,0.0009,0.0004,0.003,0.0022,0.0,0.0005,0.0009,4.1449,4.7312,1.2674,0.4178,4.8828,2.0505,2.1704,6.9283,3.5477,0.5185,1.5334,0.0002,2.9435,5.5977,5.6036,0.8877,0.5032,4.7372,1.1748,5.7473,2.4065,3.2416,0.4619,0.6681,0.3298,1.892,0.3532,0.0551,0.015,0.1216,3.311,5.8034,6.5933,2.1121,1.4667,4.7596,1.0589,4.2007,5.0176,3.3661,4.3304,3.1646,2.1528,0.3221,0.1274,5.725,1.4562,3.6473,1.1319,0.1065,0.0106,4.3725,2.5779,0.5419,0.2229,3.9453,3.1992,1.5791,0.1532,0.0759,0.531,0.8767,4.2633,4.1059,3.8842,0.8464,2.3742,1.8866,0.029,0.35,0.3394,4.6188,4.511,1.6457,0.1312,0.0796,0.0022,1.1663,4.3778,0.4942,0.2017,0.9766,0.0062,0.1571,2.4783,0.6231,0.0002,5.0556,2.8723,0.2293,0.0028,0.0041,0.0039,0.0117,0.0042,0.3512,2.7997,0.1592,0.0008,0.003,8.0705,1.514,0.0576,0.5517,2.967,0.9861,0.0476,0.0877,0.0017,0.2683,3.2423,1.0363,1.3151,5.9604,1.8947,4.9525,3.3011,0.7817,2.5703,0.4022,0.0138,0.0029,0.1417,10.3446,4.868,2.9024,4.421,0.3498,2.4486,0.4348,1.3637,0.1982,0.0167,1.0615,1.5846,0.301,2.3592,5.2054,1.5154,4.7555,1.9069,1.8585,3.5852,0.8426,0.7513,0.0002,4.9933,0.7128,3.2202,1.8801,2.8897,2.6384,0.463,0.8772,2.2307,2.4547,0.8885,3.7037,3.3726,2.1399,1.7427,0.0358,2.8166,3.7781,0.3997,2.5047,0.3231,1.0272,0.2402,0.0118,0.0023,0.0199,1.4288,1.1348,0.9043,2.1899,4.4053,1.1644,0.5871,0.0002,4.0066,5.5501,2.003,1.1364,2.7094,4.4293,1.5095,4.2338,2.6861,3.7155,2.5453]}

In 1857, < unk's father opened a new saloon at the corner of Queen Street and Queen Court Road, where he owned the < unk >'s father's and James's.\n\nIt is reported that in 1858, he became a member of the Council, and became the new head of the Public Baths. On 6 December 1862, he married Jane (or Sarah; he never knew her first name), daughter of the second Marquess of Alderley.

As part of the memorial service a poem was written by Charles Thomas, published as < unk >'s Ode. It was published in a London paper on 26 September 1886. It is as follows:\n\nO sweet and tender O daughter of England,\n\nThou dost live, where the dead live.\n\nI loved thee then as so long as Time\n\nCan talk, love as now I love thee \u2014\n\nI love thee and I love thee too:\n\nYet the sun hath set on my days.\n\nI live as Thou dost know, that I will \u2014\n\nThou will, too, and that in no shape\n\nNor form of shape, be my death.\n\n[I die, and thou live in sorrow I know\n\nThat my little girl, when she smiles upon me,\n\nWill kiss me lovingly with tears in\n\nHer eyes.

{"id":4311,"ended":true,"length":558,"gen_text":"By the time that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton occupied a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by the Norman fortress that remains the largest Roman building in southern England. The fortress was abandoned around 1100 when the English invaded from the north. During the Middle Ages, the town's medieval medieval houses were used as a military barracks, with many buildings constructed within the walls.\n\nThe town's earliest medieval settlement is believed to go back to the Iron Age, with early Anglo-Saxon and northern German settlement taking place in the area, as well as some Roman settlement from the 1st century. In the 8th century, Bishop Peter of York came to Southampton to establish a small church. A few years later, he moved the site of the church to a large rectangular field with small buildings attached to it, which was known as the \"Little London\" for its use during the reigns of the English kings from William the Conqueror to Henry V. The town also has a Roman fort known as Hadrian's Wall, which dates back to the 6th century.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, Southampton's medieval settlement became one of the main centres of the Anglo-Saxon (English) community. The Anglo-Saxon population of the area came from the area which was then known as Kent. The Saxon population is estimated at several thousand, with around 20,000 individuals settling in the area during the 6th century. The Anglo-Saxon settlers gradually became a dominant force as they had more resources and a wider range of goods. By the 11th century, Southampton had about 200 Anglo-Saxon residents. The town then experienced a period of rapid population growth in the middle of the 12th century, with an estimated population of a quarter of a million being present by the end of that period. The population is estimated to have been approximately three million by the mid-14th century, with a further three million having moved during the same period. Southampton's population peaked with a population of about thirteen million, comprising about 20 percent of the total population of England at the end of the 15th century. By the 16th century, Southampton had reached population levels of about 32 million, comprised of about 7 percent of the total population of England. The town was a major centre of trading activity, and the population was expanding at a fast rate.\n\nThe Norman conquest of 1066 devastated Southampton and many other English towns over the course of the following century. The coastal landscape, which had been largely untouched, was devastated by this attack, with many of the older buildings either collapsing or being demolished. Most of the original structures that survived were either demolished or converted for other purposes. Southampton's population plummeted over the next several centuries as a direct result of the Norman invasion, and much of the remaining population of the region was eventually absorbed into larger English areas such as Oxford and Cambridge.","token_len":601,"entropy":[1.9535,1.1813,4.4331,1.8547,11.0801,0.146,4.3529,0.5622,0.8504,0.0843,0.0019,0.2338,1.2078,6.6691,1.4369,5.654,8.4109,0.8609,8.0837,2.2767,8.5971,0.1552,3.9281,0.0018,0.0453,0.6878,8.9648,1.439,4.1136,1.7347,6.3775,3.5154,0.0854,0.8866,3.0357,0.6274,7.37,0.3318,2.5581,2.7043,3.2184,3.2104,4.5348,3.4675,3.8807,4.6309,3.2901,0.3113,4.1872,0.1964,0.6343,1.947,2.3939,1.1317,3.5933,3.5367,2.3698,3.027,0.5156,3.1628,3.3963,3.9309,1.5125,0.5915,0.9309,4.397,0.251,2.0839,0.0023,0.3904,1.0088,1.5176,2.9373,4.0973,5.3467,4.3867,0.7104,3.0793,0.4288,1.8246,4.1567,0.8442,1.5475,3.8204,3.0763,3.2838,3.9911,4.5512,0.5379,0.9012,0.7763,1.5293,0.0128,1.4625,2.4162,1.487,4.4432,2.8265,3.3123,2.5393,1.744,0.0052,8.4713,0.0281,0.1678,0.4088,4.6571,0.005,0.8805,1.9976,5.3599,2.5094,0.0598,0.0465,0.1724,3.1996,6.7425,0.9837,1.6752,3.3928,0.0237,1.5047,0.283,2.0361,3.7611,2.497,0.3828,0.0335,3.8776,3.1836,1.8395,3.4893,0.2319,2.2966,0.0033,0.6075,1.915,2.6966,0.4287,3.6698,0.0335,0.2932,0.1775,6.547,4.9793,0.4491,2.4679,5.0496,0.1628,0.4228,1.2638,1.2587,0.6925,5.1314,1.6337,1.2318,3.8847,3.5726,0.8945,0.0565,0.1566,2.5726,2.7681,1.4307,3.8963,0.5792,0.5669,1.0627,0.3821,1.6715,4.0423,3.3581,3.7663,3.8084,5.8422,2.7109,5.2842,0.6228,0.4325,1.5188,1.9232,1.8858,2.0434,0.1096,1.1321,2.946,5.4805,3.6569,1.406,3.384,0.4381,4.8838,4.4119,0.176,1.6135,2.1789,0.0014,1.5138,3.1386,0.3971,3.3507,3.8977,0.1606,0.0173,0.0012,0.5081,0.7003,3.334,0.2124,1.8282,2.923,4.4235,3.2074,0.7361,2.632,1.3612,3.6072,0.0308,5.3588,0.2483,0.0157,0.0577,0.7461,0.7877,3.1704,0.7661,0.065,0.3171,3.3702,0.0041,0.0452,0.6245,0.6129,0.0002,2.1548,0.4788,3.0198,1.5381,0.0038,0.1448,1.1468,2.5075,2.3203,3.6707,2.1351,3.802,0.015,0.1402,2.3687,2.0974,0.5354,1.2178,2.6039,0.0241,0.5052,0.0492,5.2748,3.7679,0.11,1.9883,1.6689,1.5821,3.106,0.0133,0.0109,0.2992,4.1333,1.6066,0.8693,1.0535,5.785,1.3859,1.471,2.5874,5.3479,1.4288,3.0762,0.8313,0.0158,1.9686,1.4479,1.3859,3.2009,0.8751,2.8166,3.6598,2.273,1.3398,5.8011,0.5956,1.4501,1.3796,3.2376,3.756,0.3943,0.0048,4.8318,3.4513,0.1679,0.6683,0.8087,1.9329,0.0897,3.5476,0.008,0.8481,0.26,1.5281,2.2788,0.0374,0.0067,0.3424,3.6715,5.3363,2.3887,2.4731,1.8341,1.4422,5.4876,1.2009,4.5514,2.831,1.9742,1.0518,2.9632,3.9654,1.5295,0.0072,2.84,1.8457,2.8724,0.1665,1.9426,0.0063,0.0393,0.0797,1.7926,1.0666,4.7989,3.4674,1.2826,0.0133,0.0057,0.0669,2.5419,0.9144,2.0818,1.8886,4.6168,2.8007,0.6382,1.3587,0.0197,2.5504,2.0852,0.1177,2.4577,0.0312,4.7073,0.2465,0.0043,1.2075,0.0018,0.0714,0.7808,1.1119,2.8639,1.0647,0.7817,0.1454,4.9483,1.8766,0.1627,0.0097,0.0023,5.2838,3.2002,0.5707,0.4275,0.8617,0.0019,2.8302,1.2323,0.0527,2.0676,1.681,5.2443,0.5548,0.3229,0.085,2.8985,3.7793,3.3625,0.8741,0.4936,0.224,2.9821,0.2666,1.494,0.0133,0.0095,1.6308,1.1495,2.0117,1.1396,2.6159,0.1017,3.7476,2.6044,7.1605,0.238,4.1798,0.1144,0.1417,3.1212,1.5111,0.5129,2.8999,5.4639,1.422,0.184,0.0689,2.1649,6.3103,0.2739,3.2857,4.7372,2.0966,4.5321,1.9077,0.0341,0.4711,1.1286,0.3456,0.2125,0.4175,1.9049,0.5021,2.9064,0.0016,0.0441,1.2563,0.0005,0.0165,0.0847,2.8586,0.2832,1.9189,0.0531,0.0283,0.0793,0.9365,0.8416,3.2496,6.3449,1.2922,0.5675,1.5075,4.7572,0.3815,0.8497,4.4129,0.8422,1.123,4.7405,0.2212,0.0066,0.2181,0.3803,0.2119,0.362,0.0854,0.3658,2.3944,2.0791,1.8374,3.0291,1.141,2.2847,0.4464,5.3222,1.3254,1.3482,1.7503,2.2138,2.6306,1.8585,5.1743,1.5762,0.5287,3.945,0.4396,0.4635,1.0974,0.0002,1.4844,3.4171,1.8101,0.3022,4.5334,0.0009,5.3247,1.1701,1.9251,2.4361,1.0874,3.3502,0.2048,7.1681,0.2519,3.2472,0.0021,0.8398,2.4468,1.6317,0.3137,1.2013,6.2038,5.6353,3.1589,1.3784,0.6811,0.5528,2.0117,2.1639,2.664,0.3175,1.5643,0.7603,6.3041,5.1691,1.0441,1.2348,1.3522,1.9679,0.1942,4.6919,0.9929,4.2001,4.8484,0.3009,0.4705,2.7116,0.4298,4.1256,0.1985,0.1808,3.7918,3.6451,2.2114,0.9602,0.6793,2.5668,2.2716,0.2799,1.4494,3.6674,1.0717,0.7723,0.3555,3.696,1.2274,1.3972,4.0049,3.6988,0.0748,1.0027,2.5409,0.4803,2.1253,1.9205,3.6378,0.1162,0.049,0.2738,0.4697,0.9095,1.2295,1.5264,5.6988,0.0402,0.2136,3.1149,1.1923,2.8201,0.2242,4.2937,1.0834,3.5838,1.2552,0.3082,4.4529,2.3235,5.0404,1.6396,0.0018,3.2474,0.9941,1.3179,0.1652]}
{"id":282,"ended":true,"length":544,"gen_text":"Sarnia's musical and theatrical presence in Southern Ontario is significant. The International Symphony Orchestra plays at the Imperial Theatre for an annual season lasting from September to April. In addition to symphonic recitals and summer operas, the Iso performs on many summer evenings at the annual Summer in the City program. More information is available at Sarnia's website.\n\n\nThe new Iso Theatre building is on the site of the original Iso Theatre, which closed after 45 years in the early 1970's. The City and the Iso have worked together to offer the public unique cultural programming.\n\nA New Iso Theatre\n\nThe new Iso Theatre opened in September of this year and will be open on weekdays only starting April 2. It is completely accessible to all patrons through an accessible entrance on the corner of South Front Street and South Street East. Iso Theatre is located in the heart of the City's entertainment district. The new Iso Theatre is one of the most accessible theatres in Hamilton, and an important centre for the local musical, musical theatre, theatre arts and community activity scene.\n\n\nThe Iso Theatre has a grand ceiling with beautiful sculptural elements. The theatre is a stunning, open concept structure. The building has a wonderful design language. It opens up into the City streets to give the theatre feel of a bustling streetscape (with great views of the river) but is also a private sanctuary with a spacious foyer\/barn for residents. There is a very comfortable waiting area at the end of the foyer. The building is full of bright pastel wall colours. The large main stage\/stage-level theatre is situated in the centre of the large front entry hall, and has a very generous space for people on both sides of the stage. Iso Theatre has four seating areas; the first is at the back of the stage, with a view of the audience, where patrons sit in a horseshoe shaped box that offers privacy, seating and comfort over a large area of wall. Near the back of the stage, the second area is arranged in horseshoe shaped boxes that bring people in closer to the stage, with a view of the stage and adjacent seating. The third area is similar to the first, with additional open seating areas.

{"id":4361,"ended":true,"length":537,"gen_text":"None of the conduct by the United Kingdom and Singapore that led to the ICJ to conclude that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca applied to Middle Rocks. Since Johor held the ancient island until its incorporation in 1953, ICJ jurisdiction was confined to the matter of how the territory is administered under the Constitution and the State of Johor has maintained that the Pedra Branca issue is one of internal administration. In 2004, the Court of Appeal was persuaded of this contention after finding that Brunei is a sub-servient state that has conceded sovereignty over Pedra Branca and that the issue is one for the courts to decide. The ICJ considered the State of Johor's contention that Pedra Branca belongs to Brunei and has since 1950 been a part of Johor.\n\n\nIn 2007, the High Court of South East Asia, sitting alone, reached another conclusion. It held that Brunei has sovereignty over Pedra Branca but that it does not have jurisdiction and is not bound by ICJ jurisdiction, and that the issue of Pedra Branca remains a question for the courts.\n\n\nIn 2008, the International Court of Justice in The Hague in State of Palestine v. Israel (2009) No. 3 ICJ 1272 held that the occupied territories are not part of the Middle East where the State of Israel exists and that the issue of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination is determined by international law.\n\n\nIn the same year, the Court of Auditors of Malaysia held the same finding in a two-judge bench that the Government of Malaysia has sovereignty over parts of Johor, including Pedra Branca, and that responsibility for their administration falls to it if necessary. In 2011, the Government of Malaysia had to pay RM6,000 in compensation to the owners of MCPP Pty Ltd which was not a party in the case.\n\n\nIn March 2012, the High Court in The Hague ruled that the issue of the Middle East - comprising Palestine, Israel, the Jordan River, and the Gulf of Aqaba - is one that may be resolved by international law or treaties.\n\n\nIn 2012, Singapore, Malaysia, Israel, the Jordanian Government, and United Arab Emirates decided to create the Interim Committee on the Middle East (CIEM) as part of the Quartet on Middle East Affairs.\n\n\nIn 2013, the CIEM released its first comprehensive report, which has a number of recommendations for the creation of an international peacekeeping force to secure the Middle East peace. As a result of the reports, the international community has agreed to a proposal for this force to be called the Palestinian National Authority.\n\n\nThe CIEM held that \"the Palestine Liberation Organization, while occupying the Palestinian territory, has committed gross violations of international law\" and that \"[it] operates without the authorization of the Palestine Liberation Organization under article 28 of the Charter, which confers upon it the status of an international terrorist organization\".","token_len":602,"entropy":[1.1158,0.9581,9.3053,4.3195,1.151,4.9948,3.9424,2.7561,7.8549,2.7162,2.7022,0.1015,0.4918,8.0701,0.2112,5.5148,2.7057,0.4606,3.5033,1.7439,7.4798,3.6522,0.4164,7.8488,0.0784,0.0011,0.0002,9.5217,0.5013,12.1136,5.6283,0.7109,6.0929,9.5922,0.0587,6.3075,2.3294,8.0249,2.464,2.6436,3.0576,4.3239,2.1929,5.1247,0.1485,6.0113,0.0055,4.287,2.3241,2.8126,0.091,0.893,5.1094,0.585,4.9953,0.9972,3.5558,3.9275,1.7669,3.4145,0.6171,2.1729,1.8879,1.3439,3.7688,0.6912,0.0828,0.0064,6.2878,5.1181,1.9102,1.3158,4.3219,0.0019,0.004,0.0,2.071,1.0421,3.4041,1.1754,2.142,1.5964,0.7067,3.0852,5.8256,0.1879,0.5794,2.6897,0.7687,0.0609,4.8735,3.9743,3.1871,1.0056,2.3787,4.6817,4.3759,0.1456,6.7876,0.0035,3.6538,1.6171,6.2953,0.2074,4.7755,0.0002,0.9818,3.371,1.6431,5.5379,1.897,0.3951,0.3517,0.0012,0.0011,0.0,1.9483,1.2408,1.1108,3.4821,1.4037,1.8376,2.2607,0.8079,4.9431,0.8738,0.4483,0.4401,1.7121,3.2387,0.0005,4.9761,1.0958,4.9557,0.2455,0.3672,0.0033,0.1528,1.6039,0.6439,1.8349,0.0004,0.0005,0.0,3.154,0.0569,1.4612,0.0015,1.2146,4.2095,5.1001,4.0896,1.5904,2.7353,1.0175,0.0062,2.2336,0.01,0.8583,4.6936,0.0002,2.2381,3.3431,0.0657,0.396,2.5027,0.005,0.8495,6.1678,1.9232,0.0476,3.0299,2.5417,5.202,0.2868,5.4,6.0564,0.598,1.3645,1.3006,1.0658,0.0506,3.1298,0.0033,1.6951,2.8057,0.0355,0.1391,0.0006,0.0007,0.0,3.3865,0.9677,1.5822,2.5125,0.0119,0.7879,1.7435,6.0211,2.8451,0.8303,1.1335,0.2731,2.2443,0.0014,2.4932,3.7289,2.6626,0.9397,0.7848,2.3155,1.6786,1.2731,0.0004,0.0006,0.0001,4.1473,1.7025,3.4768,0.5544,0.0849,0.3403,1.3695,1.4705,0.0002,1.6807,2.7393,0.0299,0.3574,4.4771,0.0481,0.0125,0.0071,2.1339,0.5309,0.0096,4.1336,5.9849,0.2835,0.5217,0.3617,0.5811,1.0788,2.1168,5.1163,0.057,3.4503,0.2548,4.2365,5.0647,0.013,3.998,4.2865,2.1423,0.1006,0.9485,5.1531,0.9921,1.899,1.302,1.6514,0.0031,0.5162,5.1728,0.0128,6.4818,0.8693,3.1931,0.0285,0.2508,4.6184,1.5045,1.2278,0.796,3.2462,0.4086,2.0741,5.4622,0.3948,0.4645,1.3712,0.1083,1.3005,1.1006,0.2059,0.0084,1.3557,6.7437,0.354,1.5267,0.0566,0.6271,1.3653,0.0002,1.1606,3.2524,2.0368,0.0778,0.065,0.4794,2.4899,0.2149,7.0714,0.0177,0.5805,2.4483,1.6099,4.6147,4.8113,5.0765,0.912,3.2297,5.7929,0.0759,1.0466,0.0004,0.3781,3.7498,1.0986,3.9802,0.3029,0.2006,1.3979,1.7591,0.0418,4.9437,0.0136,3.2694,0.0168,1.737,1.7281,0.2076,0.001,0.0028,0.0001,0.9109,1.2728,0.5888,6.7088,0.2714,3.862,0.2687,2.3299,0.6565,3.9288,6.9809,4.7917,0.3522,3.0867,2.6985,0.0325,0.3336,4.4254,0.0576,0.8223,5.3936,1.5526,1.6028,1.0981,3.8426,2.6529,1.2161,1.7138,0.7658,0.1708,0.7905,3.1794,0.052,6.494,5.5088,5.0599,4.4165,2.0904,0.0802,4.3474,1.7233,4.5076,2.8769,1.6496,2.8076,0.2111,0.9016,0.4211,0.6796,0.0002,1.14,4.1929,1.1302,0.0357,0.3485,1.8315,0.0058,2.3157,2.3025,0.5645,2.4941,0.4095,0.8366,4.4541,0.1689,1.9058,4.0046,0.5981,5.617,3.6325,2.2652,0.2787,1.3457,0.4795,2.0915,4.8839,3.1872,1.3361,1.9146,0.8123,3.2295,0.3854,0.0328,0.0008,0.0003,0.3983,0.78,2.5276,2.9821,5.0289,0.4262,1.611,0.5251,1.3721,0.6425,3.7561,4.9758,1.0027,1.4406,0.0002,0.9716,3.2114,0.0339,4.2375,3.0017,1.323,0.6439,3.7917,0.6213,1.4657,5.174,0.7799,0.588,0.9723,4.8655,0.1932,0.0015,4.9606,0.197,4.5712,1.1668,5.4512,0.1953,1.8265,1.0138,0.578,0.3061,0.0034,2.0976,5.9122,0.0926,2.0556,3.6507,2.9527,0.0033,0.7569,3.916,0.0028,2.0316,1.1825,0.0047,3.304,0.9267,1.8756,0.0002,0.9845,1.9237,0.0261,0.5993,1.8473,0.0001,3.7817,1.0154,1.7661,4.8748,0.206,1.7565,1.444,4.4791,3.5621,3.6162,0.0022,0.4838,1.6905,1.032,3.882,0.0412,1.8742,1.8011,2.6283,0.6772,0.1001,1.0931,3.0613,0.6371,1.8181,0.0065,2.2945,0.6995,5.2317,1.5001,0.8212,0.6803,0.7828,4.7564,0.627,0.7004,4.2112,0.023,1.348,1.8641,0.4289,3.0146,3.744,1.8095,5.5971,0.2484,1.0859,0.2107,2.9839,0.2783,4.8321,1.2043,0.5948,1.8294,0.6771,0.0002,1.9518,1.7045,0.0001,5.1504,2.0745,4.2418,1.2735,4.4722,0.6543,0.3557,2.697,5.2005,5.8814,1.1823,2.0864,0.8888,0.5894,1.2932,4.9321,5.6839,0.4543,0.1322,0.538,0.543,3.2311,0.3876,0.8851,4.574,2.8621,0.2082,6.5971,3.7898,1.3176,3.3229,0.1956,0.2609,2.9758,0.1177,0.0377,5.8097,5.7905,4.3637,0.2502,0.0818,2.4773,3.3018,1.2544,5.9423,0.007,1.7564,0.9696,0.7577,2.7423,0.0293,1.0403,1.8989,2.1806,0.2513,1.6885]}

This may affect the percentages in any number of ways. For example, if the 2013-2014 statistics are higher than the average for the previous 3 seasons, this means that the player's stats are better through the remainder of the season, which will negatively affect the percentages.\n\nThe Team Score is a combined total score between every team in the league and each player.

{"id":4558,"ended":false,"length":533,"gen_text":"Since the end of World War II, the Ministry of Education has issued statements and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo at schools under their jurisdiction. The first regulations were issued in 1953 in the year when the Minister of Education, Yasuhisa Togo, established National Schools' Organization (NSO).\n\nThe regulations that govern the usage of both Hinomaru and Kimigayo in Japan do not concern the issue of the school's independence. The NSO is an organization created on the authority of the Minister of Education. However, it is also concerned with the issue of the school being governed by the Minister of Education, and the Minister of Education is also the one who determines whether a school has received a Hinomaru Certificate or Kimigayo Certificate for use at schools.\n\nBoth certificates, Hinomaru and Kimigayo, have different purposes. The Hinomaru Certificate can be considered to be a certificate issued by the Ministry of Education. As part of its function, however, the NSO has responsibility to establish guidelines regarding the use of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. These include rules on the way in which the certificates are presented, how they are used, and how they are verified.\n\nBecause the use of the certificates is not directly under the Ministry of Education, the two certificates are different. For example, when a school issues a Hinomaru Certificate, the school presents a piece of paper containing a brief statement of the school's purpose and purposes. When a school issues a Kimigayo Certificate, the school presents an actual certificate to the person presenting it, and that person must sign it.\n\nTherefore, both certificates have different purposes. The purpose of Hinomaru, as stated above, is to certify that the school is authorized to use the symbols associated with the Japanese language. The purpose of Kimigayo is to certify that a school has acquired the skills necessary for conducting the lessons in Japanese.\n\nSchools whose students have been granted Hinomaru Certificates should be aware that if any information or certificate concerning the school is used by anyone, it not only risks being used falsely, but also the use of the information or certificate could be seen to be an encouragement to do even more self-destructive things. The responsibility of the NSO is to set forth guidelines to students and teachers concerning the use of the certificates, and the school will not be held to liability if a student abuses the certificate issued to the school.\n\nSchools, however, are not responsible for any misuse of this information or certificate. The NSO cannot be held liable if they fail to set forth the guidelines described above, nor is it our responsibility to inform the Ministry of Education about this.

{"id":4019,"ended":true,"length":539,"gen_text":"A dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust ( typically found in space ). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is more 'conductive'. This explains why smaller objects vibrate (like a violin) when struck.\n\nA plasma with a larger particle concentration is more conductive. It's difficult to describe a plasma that contains a large number of 'conductive' particles. This is similar to how air and metal have particles.\n\nIt is a plasma\n\nA plasma is formed by plasma particles colliding, and the intense heat created by the reaction causes it to grow. When it is larger than a millimetre ( one-hundreth of a micron ) it is a plasma. When it is larger than one centimetre (.01 mm ) it is a plasma with electrons ( protons). When it is smaller than one tenth of a millimetre (.001 mm ) it is a low density ionosphere, and there are electrons in the atmosphere.\n\nA magnetic field creates a magnetic field around the ionosphere. This causes the wind in the jet stream to vary in strength. When the jet stream crosses a magnetic pole it experiences large variations in magnetic field strength. This creates a strong wind, where the air flows around the plasma, like a turbulent liquid ( see here ).\n\nA low pressure is generated above the 'crest' of the thunderstorm and produces strong wind, and the flow of the wind is called a downdraft, when that occurs as high in the atmosphere as 10 km. The large density of the plasma causes it to become thinner, so the downdraft reaches the ground, then slows down the air flow towards the ground, so the downdraft becomes a low pressure at the ground. The stronger the downdraft, the more energy that is lost to the air, where less energy is available to produce a greater thunderstorm.\n\nThe temperature will rise as the electrical current flowing in the updraft increases, and with the rising temperature, the ion activity will rise as the energy of the ions increases. During a thunderstorm, the ionosphere is more electrically charged than anywhere else in the solar system ( see here ).\n\nElectrons are the most abundant kind of charged element. The electron is a very unstable particle, only existing in very small quantities. So, if they are charged, the particles have to be very light to remain stable.\n\nThe first particle to be observed was Beta Cerni, detected by the Large Electron Positron Collider in 1979. Many other particles have been discovered since then, including quarks, which are the building blocks of protons ( see here ). Most of the time a quark interacts with all of the other quarks ( proton and antielectron ) creating a new particle, which in turn creates a disturbance in the ionosphere. The disturbance is the 'electron cloud'.","token_len":602,"entropy":[12.9618,10.6781,8.1244,5.8387,4.5175,0.1636,3.3991,5.8363,4.4567,12.022,5.5152,0.3584,2.325,3.1608,1.7316,2.0089,1.1191,8.1676,6.2026,5.3432,2.4078,4.7658,0.1433,2.2643,0.0086,1.7616,4.1442,1.7227,3.1295,1.9381,6.6037,1.0888,2.1571,2.0647,5.9736,3.2444,0.0551,1.7684,2.135,4.9196,0.2892,5.8599,4.354,6.2762,0.0118,4.2841,3.0039,1.0802,3.0849,2.0779,1.1293,3.4419,1.5728,1.2929,0.0396,2.7781,1.435,3.4871,1.4453,3.6612,2.1324,2.0426,1.0624,1.184,3.0013,0.0016,0.9684,3.2579,2.9297,5.6861,0.1945,2.5786,2.1389,0.7762,1.9859,1.6447,1.562,0.8498,0.6831,0.0086,4.7987,2.2367,0.5542,0.1138,0.2009,0.763,2.5959,0.7757,4.6602,0.0165,2.1885,5.7812,3.815,6.4585,2.9817,4.0717,3.1105,1.5328,0.0002,4.3014,1.223,3.7836,2.2088,4.8867,0.0002,1.6394,0.3817,0.3874,4.3775,1.8216,4.0477,2.7533,1.8523,0.0003,3.3131,2.5841,2.0898,5.6795,1.1372,3.0539,1.138,0.7421,5.1192,2.2058,4.3197,0.0074,3.7757,1.0362,3.1069,2.1645,1.8328,4.3689,0.1557,0.9138,4.4041,0.466,0.0006,2.0878,4.8083,1.1027,1.9462,5.5544,0.0861,0.0737,0.7076,3.1679,1.0899,0.6185,0.7631,0.6001,1.9057,0.6523,0.2457,2.8672,0.3818,0.307,1.6105,0.0119,2.1898,1.6623,0.031,0.0009,7.2522,4.2582,2.6507,3.4835,0.1075,0.0727,0.3633,0.8377,1.3321,4.5627,2.6036,3.5349,0.0001,2.9107,1.8541,0.129,0.082,1.7353,0.0559,0.4423,3.5894,0.1188,0.0584,0.6473,0.0071,0.0012,0.2641,0.771,0.0716,2.3023,0.0725,0.0356,0.2052,6.9286,1.6685,3.1867,3.5035,3.0199,1.547,5.757,1.1,3.924,1.3717,0.7107,3.8087,0.5607,0.6174,0.0002,1.9512,5.3748,0.1473,3.731,0.607,1.4721,0.3455,3.0626,0.6354,4.9325,0.0436,0.512,1.6115,2.7192,0.6629,7.0865,3.8339,0.0924,6.3467,0.5006,0.1908,5.2303,1.2535,1.0196,0.7463,3.0498,0.7051,1.8292,0.0536,4.089,1.4952,0.6642,4.409,1.0429,5.6884,5.2643,3.39,0.0712,2.5561,0.2492,0.1337,0.4909,1.0861,2.6067,1.0195,3.1307,1.7953,2.3952,5.0413,0.4586,2.336,3.1444,2.5584,0.2009,2.8389,2.3314,4.2665,0.6486,4.6403,3.6204,3.7089,3.859,3.8497,0.4831,0.7462,0.0002,2.3958,3.9597,2.3219,3.2035,3.3265,3.4407,0.1457,5.9111,5.6071,2.7874,0.3063,0.156,0.114,5.7046,0.1593,3.328,5.9493,3.0477,2.9018,2.8763,2.4236,2.153,5.257,0.4248,1.1075,2.7601,1.7824,2.2537,0.6056,1.1719,0.0035,0.0003,2.9981,3.8023,6.6527,3.1655,5.401,3.4224,3.9219,0.0316,0.0961,0.2748,3.788,0.8767,1.9296,1.8233,6.0889,3.672,0.1955,0.399,1.878,2.0919,1.855,0.0101,3.2037,6.1224,1.687,2.57,1.4127,1.1718,0.0014,0.0009,5.5377,1.7253,0.3868,2.4341,5.0649,3.96,0.5354,5.7292,1.9979,1.3973,4.8509,0.1168,0.1933,1.3821,2.8407,1.1209,2.4301,0.0018,0.0009,2.4971,1.0101,3.4028,0.048,3.986,0.7471,0.3373,0.6268,1.8284,5.5341,0.4162,0.4667,0.002,0.0005,0.6039,0.0382,1.7096,2.7758,3.0872,0.3937,1.5598,1.2864,0.3954,2.5682,1.5416,6.4948,6.0943,0.8564,0.177,1.1139,0.5399,2.2299,1.5811,6.6685,2.799,0.0188,0.3022,0.4525,0.0002,1.4704,4.7457,6.6978,2.7454,1.5742,0.1942,6.3115,1.5138,5.1049,1.317,0.0524,4.3555,0.0019,1.2296,1.3312,1.0128,5.3969,1.223,3.8919,0.1689,1.1065,0.4252,3.1871,7.5658,1.1926,3.1809,2.0016,2.633,5.2806,2.177,0.1295,1.1906,1.1434,0.334,5.951,1.0955,0.4293,0.0058,0.788,0.6713,2.3788,2.7708,1.3552,4.099,1.7019,0.0233,1.0805,0.5704,5.7307,0.0471,0.6604,0.0372,3.3579,0.0211,3.039,2.1379,0.2918,0.1914,0.8778,0.0002,4.611,1.7192,1.6176,2.3011,2.002,1.2277,5.0429,0.0113,3.4069,7.4019,2.3637,2.0977,2.9279,1.111,1.4172,3.074,4.7467,0.8055,0.8941,5.344,2.7035,1.0181,1.7244,0.2635,0.675,0.5821,4.2154,1.5593,3.0067,4.5538,0.9622,4.5313,0.7389,2.4435,3.9258,2.8757,0.9888,0.4506,0.8821,3.9892,2.1536,3.3797,0.7849,0.531,1.9535,0.0002,1.2805,5.1595,4.4728,1.2782,0.8156,3.673,0.965,7.0075,4.2167,1.4248,1.4772,1.1248,6.3529,1.5099,1.0029,5.3453,0.4404,0.0007,1.2426,0.0104,0.0002,1.2044,1.4985,4.6077,0.4793,5.9662,0.9916,0.726,0.7279,0.5952,1.1619,0.4657,0.721,0.9031,1.1494,5.8709,0.0894,0.3908,3.6985,0.6405,1.1562,0.6727,0.0165,0.0509,1.019,0.0006,3.8734,3.1301,0.0845,0.2457,5.1549,0.5869,0.4773,4.233,4.1272,2.3168,0.0131,4.77,0.4198,6.5599,1.8305,0.3171,0.4374,1.5159,0.0031,3.4873,3.995,0.0299,1.261,4.7901,2.1713,0.381,0.0333,0.8351,4.4299,0.723,2.5206,0.522,1.753,2.3642,3.7626,0.2046,2.2688,0.9115,6.891,0.3691,0.1025,4.1991,0.0267,0.6205,2.2448,1.665,1.6187,3.0462,2.2014,1.3873,0.5783,1.7467,1.2291]}
{"id":800,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"The Lyceum is a Grade II listed building opened in 1856 at a cost of \u00a3 6 @, @ 500 as a `` mutual improvement `` centre for the working men of Oldham.\nBarracuda in the City The building was first put to work by Robert Thomas' son Thomas and his partner Thomas Moxon and was the site for the manufacture in 1856 of a number of household utensils used in the West Lancashire County of Lancashire and its surroundings. This company is well documented, and the house is still standing, although at the rear it is only a facade now. Thomas Moxon & Son were the first firm to set up shop in the Barracuda Building, on 9th October 1856, but it would be 18 years before they were successful in their endeavor to found a manufacturing firm in the area.\nA good representation of the Barracuda Building with the addition of the new houses and new road to the City Hall and new office block.\nRobert Thomas, son Thomas Moxon and Thomas' wife who have been living in Barracuda House.\nThomas Moxon, son Thomas Thomas' wife and the other three partners from Thomas Moxon who had started their business in the Barracuda building. From the 1868 census, the buildings name is unknown. When the firm was dissolved in 1885, the only man living in the house, Thomas Moxon, who was the manager of the business had moved out.\nThe Barracuda Place Street in the days when it was still the old Barracuda House. The Barracuda Place Street and the Barr-Burton Road which ran under the frontage of the Barracuda Place and was the main route for people on their way to work in the City of Oldham at the time when the Barracuda house was being developed. I am glad that my photographs do not go any farther back in time than this period of time so that this part of the history of the Barracuda House does not get covered up by the new buildings that have come to replace them during the last hundred years or so.

He lives with his father in Detroit and his mother in Kansas where he is a science teacher at Highland Park High School in Kansas City, MO. His twin sister Lucy lives in Omaha with her parents and her cousin, Sarah Kestle. Miles and Lucy are good friends, with Lucy being the one of the only people to know about his twin.

He is good friends as well with James Van Pelt ( Mike Baxter ) and David Van Pelt ( Kevin Hoch ).

{"id":1086,"ended":true,"length":551,"gen_text":"In the colonial United States the nuclear family was the most common family form. Typical families consisted of five or more children initially ; because of high infant mortality rates, only a few families had three or more children. In the early 20th Century the American fertility rate had fallen to 2.1 children per woman. By 1940 approximately one in five children were born to unmarried women. With the rapid change in birth control techniques during the 1950s and 60s, America's birth rate began climbing to over three children per woman and continued to increase for 30 years. According to estimates, between 1970 and 2005 the total number of live births to unmarried women nearly doubled (from 9 million to 18 million). While a small number of teenagers were involved in births during this time, such births were still a minor problem.\nFertility Rates by Economic Status\nWhile the overall birth rate has increased in the US, some groups have seen an even more dramatic rise in their fertility. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the highest fertility rates are found among the highest income groups. The high school drop out rate is particularly high in the South, the Midwest and the West. For example, about 18 percent of white unmarried women who had one or more children in 2006 had attained a bachelor's degree. These women had the highest rates of childbearing in the industrialized world which is noteworthy because the U.S. birth rate is one of the lowest in Western Europe. These women also had the lowest fertility rates in the developed world which may be surprising for two reasons. First, most women in Western Europe do not live in poor countries, but in wealthier ones. Additionally, most women in Western Europe are very comfortable with using contraception, including abortions.\nThe birth rate for African-American and Hispanic women in the US is very low at less than a quarter of the rate of white women. For example, of all unmarried women ( unmarried women with children are excluded from this statistic ), about one-fifth of black unmarried women over 35 years old were childless. About 7.1 per 100 unmarried African-American married women aged 15-44 gave birth. For Hispanic unmarried women over 35, about one-third had one or more children. About 7.9 per 100 unmarried Hispanic women aged 15-44 gave birth.\nFertility by Income and Religion\nIncome is a very important factor in determining fertility in the US. On average, the highest-income women in the US have 10 times the number of children as the lowest-income women.

{"id":1929,"ended":true,"length":529,"gen_text":"Research on Iguanodon decreased during the early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe. A new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic revision would be born in the 1960s: Carcharodon occidentalis, or \"pig-nosed horse.\" While Iguanodon's evolutionary history has long been well known, pig-nosed horses have rarely been seen alive in the wild.\n\nThe newly discovered and well-preserved remains of a single juvenile pig-nosed horse were unearthed at the bottom of a lake in the southern Urals, near the village of Chirnovo, in 1959. To this day, the identity and geographic habitat of this animal are unknown.\n\nThe specimen was found within a limestone cave system, which had reportedly been dug out in the late 1800s to make way for a railroad line. These caves, though relatively large, remained virtually empty for some time after the opening of the railway. As part of an ongoing effort to map and identify cave systems in Russia, archaeologists uncovered the cave system in 1958.\n\nAfter digging the cave out and carefully transporting and moving the animal's remains to the village of Chirnovo, the scientists began a painstaking excavation campaign. Eventually, the skeleton was completely unearthed, and the complete set of bones was studied for two years. Finally, in 1963, the skeletal remains were transferred to the State Historical Museum in St. Petersburg for study.\n\nWhile several species of pig-nosed horse lived in Eastern Europe at the end of the Paleocene Epoch (between 3735 and 3350 million years ago), these horses were unique compared to modern horses in that they possessed a relatively short neck. In light of this feature, their skull structure and upper jaw structure are more similar to a modern horse than their modern African relatives.\n\nIt didn't take long before the skeletal remains were analyzed. The results indicated that the horse's skull was elongated relative to its head. The skeleton was also relatively light in its upper torso, similar to that of a modern equine. The fact that the pig-nosed horse, which was likely short on water and food, lived on land and rarely sought refuge within a cave system suggests that it was also a terrestrial, terrestrial, terrestrial creature.\n\nDespite its long neck, the animal's relatively short skull and relatively light form suggests that they probably walked on the ground. Instead of running on the ground, as modern zebras do today, pigs-nosed horses likely utilized their long legs to run down slopes, climbing trees, and over cliffs. Interestingly, the horse's foot appears to be somewhat large and powerful and seems to have assisted the animal in its upright gait.\n\nPerhaps this pig-nosed horse could have been an ancestral horse that moved onto land during the late Paleocene Era, which lasted from approximately 3735-3100 thousand years ago.","token_len":604,"entropy":[3.5474,7.642,7.3435,1.457,0.1516,10.4471,3.7548,0.1258,3.4998,2.7296,0.0018,0.1551,0.9513,0.0207,0.0613,2.7949,9.1547,4.332,5.3248,1.4771,2.3656,0.0036,10.8853,0.0002,5.0667,0.9425,4.0949,3.3361,4.0664,5.7778,4.2652,2.0801,1.472,3.0355,0.0077,3.8471,1.8043,1.7748,5.8745,0.2247,1.2339,3.9148,1.3022,3.6508,1.0875,0.6729,2.5772,0.0481,2.7573,4.117,0.6569,0.0104,0.5554,8.0069,0.0354,0.006,1.6603,2.1376,1.5232,3.7664,0.7151,0.3545,0.367,0.0303,4.5633,0.8193,4.7443,3.1505,0.0661,0.0041,0.015,2.7279,4.6835,1.2245,2.5278,3.0869,0.1303,2.3936,1.3004,0.1602,4.8819,0.0188,0.0147,0.0528,0.2711,1.9308,4.6055,0.169,2.6049,0.9565,1.6884,0.2679,0.0317,0.5137,1.4263,0.0016,2.4011,5.1265,0.5816,5.4362,3.8061,0.1305,0.1299,0.0002,2.0125,0.2001,1.0969,4.3233,4.3995,1.6553,0.0029,0.0009,0.0048,0.0316,2.2268,3.1931,2.706,1.0195,3.655,0.0049,0.3892,2.7497,0.4392,1.5862,3.7493,4.7039,0.0081,1.9023,1.9162,0.397,1.996,0.0231,4.4183,2.8362,1.6644,0.5953,1.1263,1.0802,5.3077,0.2402,5.616,2.5794,0.0195,0.0958,1.0127,4.8782,2.1148,5.0594,6.346,0.0278,0.8024,2.8093,1.4915,0.4834,0.274,1.276,0.0002,1.9256,3.0606,1.0514,2.4932,4.49,0.6333,4.5331,1.4966,2.5602,1.5067,1.804,2.4995,6.354,0.2986,3.5412,1.3649,2.1479,0.4572,2.1096,1.6675,0.0154,1.8873,2.1458,0.9591,0.0037,0.3793,2.3962,0.9262,0.1595,5.7228,1.2413,1.9933,4.727,3.6613,2.8745,0.4787,5.871,4.3002,3.664,0.9852,4.6022,0.4443,1.9396,1.14,4.7484,0.0602,0.0767,1.4547,0.7829,3.8977,4.7731,0.0014,2.1407,1.3876,2.2708,0.1103,4.2958,2.0966,4.8382,3.1576,1.0265,0.7455,2.2776,0.3091,3.0583,4.1302,0.7497,3.5502,0.8366,0.5198,4.2815,0.5871,1.1442,0.0002,3.4489,5.3423,3.1232,0.8863,2.6814,2.3908,3.976,4.2649,3.9289,4.4596,0.21,2.1402,1.9424,0.4109,1.1981,1.2572,4.6055,0.8848,0.085,0.0043,0.0024,0.0028,0.1462,1.093,2.3062,2.3436,2.2164,2.4169,2.7862,4.5558,0.7026,5.2075,0.2326,1.1244,3.7171,0.6304,4.551,3.0495,1.2007,0.9184,1.52,5.0623,3.6513,0.0134,1.4412,0.588,3.7987,3.0637,4.1716,0.4221,0.663,4.5552,0.0484,0.7413,2.972,0.0619,0.7418,4.1277,0.0616,0.5072,3.1255,0.0963,0.5979,3.8964,4.9086,0.0633,1.0739,1.6157,0.1136,0.0163,2.1665,1.9741,0.2815,0.3547,0.0002,3.7918,5.309,3.1702,0.0417,0.9933,0.0028,0.0016,0.0031,1.7253,4.0366,0.4932,6.0654,0.2911,3.1197,0.2881,1.9569,0.0018,0.0053,4.1838,1.461,1.9551,0.0002,1.4912,3.2204,4.9098,9.7952,0.2404,1.6808,1.1528,0.8826,0.0108,0.0092,0.089,3.6353,2.9018,0.7936,3.8772,3.8329,0.1255,2.0434,1.1918,1.8357,1.0454,0.2893,2.8635,1.1051,4.4196,1.72,2.7302,2.0608,2.9801,6.9849,0.0043,0.7156,3.9822,0.0734,5.1097,4.4044,3.9345,2.119,4.7921,0.711,2.4895,2.1031,3.6875,0.5757,0.0378,4.0777,1.7228,0.3745,0.7074,4.388,1.4605,4.1048,1.5969,0.244,0.6853,0.0002,4.4437,6.4981,0.0004,0.0396,0.0479,2.7794,1.1576,4.7052,0.1458,2.1457,3.2555,1.1892,1.6948,3.4241,2.7727,0.0923,0.4476,3.8506,2.5127,1.4723,0.8969,4.9485,0.5057,3.7824,0.0046,0.5431,3.5016,2.6226,1.598,5.1055,1.6699,1.5266,3.0206,3.7956,1.7152,3.7385,3.1497,2.9903,0.6892,4.3554,0.0531,1.7632,0.0183,1.1296,0.2984,3.189,0.6733,0.4868,1.8083,4.927,0.0124,0.4215,2.5683,0.0153,0.0018,0.0154,0.0768,5.5699,2.1759,1.5356,3.6233,5.6075,5.039,4.7508,1.7324,3.5409,0.6778,3.3733,2.5078,2.173,2.0921,5.9229,5.9278,2.0891,3.232,2.853,0.1197,1.4734,1.7284,0.1386,1.3011,1.0148,5.0198,2.0525,2.3695,4.1183,3.4582,4.4251,1.2462,1.5639,0.2049,0.3334,0.0002,3.9398,1.5194,4.6429,0.6067,0.4334,0.4391,3.4424,1.2076,4.9004,0.7286,2.6409,1.3654,1.7189,1.0878,6.4775,3.949,0.141,4.3084,2.524,2.7754,0.7618,2.1601,0.0862,1.2535,4.8862,0.1277,2.7354,1.6706,1.5206,0.1524,0.3364,2.6853,0.9347,5.6555,0.0,0.0002,0.5195,4.2075,0.0212,3.9364,0.1551,0.0085,0.001,0.0136,1.7875,5.6474,1.3214,1.1124,2.3113,0.7676,2.9516,4.8024,4.4668,1.7142,5.3196,0.9911,0.8983,0.469,2.8447,3.051,0.3133,5.2831,0.0803,0.7955,3.853,0.5188,5.116,3.6944,0.1415,1.6575,4.2565,5.2656,2.1238,4.578,4.6718,4.8057,0.2477,0.3695,4.8097,1.3572,0.7598,0.3449,2.0263,3.82,1.9309,0.0,0.2413,0.4238,0.0002,4.6069,3.8111,3.5955,0.0042,0.0028,0.0077,0.0102,4.0643,0.7302,0.958,2.1664,4.7451,2.1078,1.751,4.8126,2.1928,0.1929,2.8543,0.1757,2.4275,0.7876,0.0265,5.293,1.2693,3.727,3.0131,0.3656,2.33,1.4607,0.4268,3.3129,1.9008,2.2429,4.1044,0.0168,0.0265,0.15]}
{"id":1883,"ended":false,"length":575,"gen_text":"The anniversary of the landings, 25 April, has since 1916 been recognised in Australia and New Zealand as Anzac Day, now one of their most important national occasions. It does not, nor has it ever been the practice to refer to the date of Australia's declaration of war in June, 1942 as Anzac Day, although those words seem to have been in use at the time as well. Anzac Day thus has been an international custom since the dawn of the First World War. The first Australia Day was in 1926 and the first official official act of government was that of placing the country 'under the Australian Flag' on 20 April 1915. On 11 December 1941, the Australian Parliament first proclaimed that Anzac Day was a national holiday, replacing the previous designation of 'D-Day' which fell on 14 April. At the same time a law was enacted to change the government's official portrait into one of Mr Arthur Phillip (later King George VI) in the uniform of the Australian Defence Force. On 26 April, the Act passed the Lower House and the Upper House was adjourned so that the bill could be read a second time. The passage through both Houses of the Parliament of the Official Portrait of Australia Day was a remarkable feat of political skill and political timing that gave birth to the present day Anzac Day. The law was also amended by the Australian War Memorial (now the Australian National War Memorial) on 11 August 1942 to reflect the fact that the war had ended and that the military operations were ceased on 7 May. On 30 February 1947, the first public act of commemoration was the official declaration that the war was done and Australia's forces had become a permanent part of our national life. Australia Day itself was formally proclaimed as a Government Day on 10 November 1943, and in 1967 the day was changed to include military and civilian celebrations, such as the 'Anzac Day Parade', 'Battle of Anzac Cove', and the 'Anzac Day Service'. On the day, the Queen will join the Prime Minister and other Commonwealth leaders in the annual Anzac Day march through the Melbourne CBD.\n\nAnzac Day is an almost entirely nonpolitical occasion, with no public events or formal proceedings. The main purpose of the day is for Australians to come together to celebrate their country's courage and sacrifice, and to remember the men and women who served with us. This is one of the things that make Anzac Day such a fitting celebration on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of our arrival in New Guinea. Australia has had many different heroes throughout her history who, through their bravery, sacrifice, courage, or sheer resolve, served her well and made us proud... but only one man has won our respect and admiration for more than half a century and remains the hero he always has been... the only one of our nation's heroes to be so universally admired and venerated by both Australians of all backgrounds and in all demographics.

{"id":213,"ended":false,"length":577,"gen_text":"Aside from his career in hockey, Ross was interested in improving the game. Prior to the start of the 1927 \u2013 28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal netting where three triangular metal bars were placed in front of the boards. The front plate had five openings which were filled with wooden dowels. Each opening has a wooden dowel in the middle, a metal wire and a metal plug with a wooden peg on top. This design was similar to the designs used at the US Women's college, the University of Washington. At this time, the metal plugs were made of metal or ivory. The wires were made of steel with two strands of wire each. To the left and right sides of the goal net were three large wooden dowels with a pegs on them. If any one of those dowels dropped, a large metal ball would drop to the ice with the ball sticking out from the side opposite the drop. The ball had the capacity to contain a weight of about 250 pounds. It was to be placed at least 10 feet away from the net, so some players would use three different types of sticks. Ross was not a great goaltender at this time, so he used a small wooden ball, like one you might see in today's game. When trying to get a puck through the puck netting, the ball would get stuck in the two dowels at the top of the goal. In order to free the ball, the goalie would release a piece of wood from his stick and swing the wood at the ball in order to push it out of the way. This game was played with the help of a rubber band.The goal netting design of the 1927 \u2013 28 season changed after the 1933 \u2013 34 season. Due to the size of the goal, the length of the nets and increasing speed and skill, the size of goal nets shrunk. The goal netting grew to 30 feet (9.8 meters) long. At this time, the goal nets were made from iron. All of the goal nets were black with white sides, and with the netting was put a glass window, for the goalie to see where the puck was at all times. The glass window at the net was made of sheet glass. Ross had the original goal nets fixed up during the 1927 \u2013 28 season, but he had them removed in the 1934 season.During the 1933 \u2013 34 season, the goal nets were replaced with a rubber sheet on the inside. This changed the goal netting to glass. According to HockeyFacts.com, the puck with plastic, metal, wood or some other new material fell through the netting. The puck usually caused minor injuries if it broke through on the inside, and if it missed, the goalie could still see the puck. However, it was considered unsafe for a hockey player to pass the puck through the netting.In 1936, the goal nets were replaced with steel netting, which was replaced in the 1940 \u2013 42 season with new goal netting","token_len":605,"entropy":[0.1217,4.1559,5.671,1.403,5.0282,0.1282,6.9284,2.7824,7.8224,0.0098,7.216,1.508,4.6478,3.9597,7.4766,0.0029,2.8654,2.9982,0.0045,0.6997,7.7191,9.075,1.3884,0.2106,0.1661,2.5422,1.785,3.4053,0.6278,1.1519,5.1373,0.1251,6.4654,5.1308,1.1815,5.2435,5.5288,5.0102,3.1675,3.6917,0.8342,1.4384,1.2919,1.8825,0.053,0.1875,5.6307,0.7937,1.3526,5.2979,6.189,2.9968,4.9489,5.0091,3.3292,1.6065,3.6917,0.104,4.6059,2.4645,0.0592,1.048,3.381,1.6587,6.8558,0.5318,4.2973,1.5294,0.0095,3.0046,0.9874,1.2202,2.1729,4.1327,2.201,4.2433,3.2903,0.6167,1.9046,4.8273,3.91,0.5119,3.7831,4.3739,2.4418,0.994,0.2225,2.8044,2.4059,1.0927,3.7965,0.0282,0.6447,6.3579,0.456,2.4832,0.4635,4.9236,5.1316,0.011,6.0377,3.2839,1.1477,0.3346,0.0034,2.9126,0.5631,4.6495,2.7301,0.1668,0.2817,0.8166,4.8077,4.282,0.6057,2.7604,0.6115,3.3654,3.7587,5.7321,1.3231,1.318,3.1285,0.5578,1.0244,0.1991,3.3125,3.9052,4.3568,2.8456,0.6173,1.0977,2.9486,0.6144,5.0242,3.8531,1.5213,2.7899,0.0845,4.0091,0.2515,0.1721,1.3471,1.9416,1.5785,3.6413,4.1909,2.372,0.85,0.1356,2.2587,1.5351,6.0522,2.4822,0.985,2.5835,0.4027,5.3672,3.9705,3.4476,0.1396,3.2568,0.5067,0.0171,3.7525,0.8887,2.4837,4.8548,1.0294,3.0049,0.4139,2.3498,2.6062,0.055,0.6878,3.7998,1.0751,3.2691,5.1842,0.4891,2.4736,0.414,3.3863,4.8899,0.6731,3.305,0.2687,1.3425,2.262,3.1079,3.2118,4.5381,0.4543,4.869,1.3116,4.8073,0.4509,2.3158,4.6067,0.4247,0.4155,3.5424,0.5809,4.5529,0.4299,3.5869,2.8204,3.982,2.9299,0.194,1.7335,0.0387,0.0604,1.219,2.6224,3.1955,7.2512,2.3025,1.4835,2.7414,6.5435,3.5057,3.3394,0.0067,3.1216,1.5025,3.368,1.957,3.6666,2.1264,2.532,4.013,3.1332,1.341,0.1253,0.6486,2.3304,0.5774,1.9953,1.0245,3.7104,1.6701,4.2141,3.1295,5.2875,3.6261,2.354,1.6772,2.1253,1.0183,4.2452,0.0097,2.5487,0.3116,4.119,6.7523,0.0454,2.903,1.7766,1.5653,2.6395,0.4844,3.8499,2.5876,0.6933,0.2245,1.5006,2.6065,0.7886,3.4906,1.0468,1.093,0.1654,5.9767,2.2179,0.1379,2.5672,0.1925,1.908,1.031,0.0764,0.8977,2.6597,3.7704,0.7305,0.0674,2.0507,0.2663,0.2234,0.1863,1.2802,0.9659,0.2945,5.6309,2.0921,4.6393,0.0076,0.5409,1.388,0.8349,0.5566,1.7213,4.9402,1.7702,1.784,2.4834,0.06,1.2769,3.7183,1.2375,0.0152,3.6831,0.2959,0.9015,1.0971,0.0417,1.7177,0.0788,2.2168,4.4583,0.9047,1.7757,2.7038,1.7891,3.8826,0.0186,1.0972,3.6595,2.5255,1.5657,6.6886,1.4868,0.3887,0.658,2.3267,3.1457,0.4141,0.564,0.4213,0.1509,0.1995,4.1492,3.2208,1.0414,5.2753,0.9332,0.2052,0.0351,0.442,5.5902,0.0117,0.6137,4.8027,0.1956,0.1837,1.3349,3.7008,0.823,5.9318,0.0719,0.1766,2.727,1.6362,6.723,3.9871,3.797,1.8464,1.9443,0.7837,4.8424,0.1084,2.1773,0.3228,5.107,0.9884,1.1195,0.8664,0.7676,0.2417,6.0658,1.7753,5.1577,0.2824,3.9052,0.2127,0.9632,2.1863,1.2751,0.1845,1.2095,1.5531,4.1791,0.7735,0.1012,0.1791,0.8145,1.102,1.19,0.5267,1.1253,2.2269,4.1254,1.5721,5.6697,1.9682,0.1747,1.1004,0.3766,0.8361,4.6357,1.9213,1.5541,5.074,2.5547,1.938,5.1927,1.8182,4.4456,0.3451,4.066,5.3122,2.2114,5.722,2.9616,2.8689,4.9211,1.2269,2.8144,0.2334,0.4682,2.4758,0.4905,0.1714,0.3545,4.2765,0.3065,0.0216,0.0998,1.2805,1.236,0.8419,5.326,0.1904,3.5511,1.0633,2.2035,0.6514,5.3595,1.2675,1.1889,4.7538,2.9375,2.1807,4.8306,0.514,1.1954,5.4021,2.115,3.508,0.2599,1.6135,0.1183,0.1182,0.0646,1.7319,1.0057,1.9169,2.2524,2.1838,1.6831,2.2795,0.9452,1.9996,1.7994,0.6508,4.6486,0.1835,3.9956,0.0916,0.1041,0.0489,0.0492,0.6075,1.0397,0.6382,0.506,2.0913,0.575,1.5685,3.9991,1.9593,4.2453,0.7314,2.0898,1.764,2.2232,3.554,0.1928,1.7648,0.6961,0.2183,1.4955,5.4031,1.166,6.044,0.0055,4.4685,5.9351,1.4484,0.1889,0.1852,0.4865,1.0756,4.9959,5.6966,6.905,5.4115,3.323,1.298,2.2065,0.8641,6.0894,0.4274,6.8711,0.3333,5.3598,0.7567,0.1273,1.1842,0.732,1.6038,1.3753,1.4059,5.2912,5.4782,4.0877,1.306,6.0705,0.521,4.4341,1.2636,6.3544,0.6847,1.4781,2.2413,2.8958,2.6972,0.4195,4.9136,1.4931,1.5253,1.8888,1.9572,4.3504,1.8089,1.2017,0.0458,1.0278,3.6895,0.0227,2.8138,0.8948,4.0397,4.571,1.7028,1.7782,3.8812,0.3882,0.0571,5.2272,0.5775,0.0858,0.7528,0.1525,0.8595,0.6251,0.9957,3.3308,3.2992,0.2347,0.6135,1.0561,0.6411,0.3137,1.0349,0.3597,3.7998,1.3412,0.0272,2.2105,1.2425,0.9108,4.3681,1.3471,1.7552,1.6076,1.0802,0.8489,0.0266,2.5484,4.371,1.3613,1.453,0.0573]}

They can also discriminate social distinctions such as age, gender and status.\" ( http:\/\/www.birds-of-the-world.org\/owl\/raven.htm#behavioral )","token_len":605,"entropy":[11.5965,9.106,2.3358,0.5803,6.0832,5.6759,1.3193,2.0541,7.5368,0.8947,3.7954,17.1113,10.2296,6.5156,7.5775,8.3882,3.01,0.9208,1.4222,5.8542,8.9577,3.2947,1.3238,5.7375,2.9275,4.7909,2.5673,7.4139,1.5842,1.9401,2.4444,6.6871,2.987,2.292,0.8544,4.2904,2.309,1.744,1.9187,4.0217,3.8359,2.7132,5.965,1.9785,3.493,0.4226,0.3579,4.3292,3.8952,0.0042,0.917,0.0015,0.0062,0.0036,0.0002,0.0029,0.0015,0.0017,0.2219,0.0031,0.2675,0.0,1.6226,2.5019,0.8232,3.2736,0.256,0.0022,5.3029,0.3001,3.5349,1.0284,0.0179,3.6007,0.0328,3.4636,1.4315,0.0282,4.1264,0.2825,1.7548,0.8476,0.8365,0.2284,4.3966,3.443,0.2266,0.9561,5.6117,0.0006,0.5238,2.3163,5.9632,0.3156,0.8608,0.7161,0.3424,0.6626,4.3436,0.5205,1.2947,0.2429,4.3008,1.3048,4.1273,3.6013,3.3915,1.0572,2.8013,3.228,0.7742,2.6071,1.4088,1.0056,2.5168,0.7973,3.2692,2.182,2.4459,0.1407,3.8127,1.6954,2.5709,0.0018,2.4575,0.6762,2.0939,0.0127,0.7533,2.7954,1.7488,1.0768,5.4331,2.5709,0.0,1.1343,3.749,4.1465,1.5272,0.3677,4.4916,0.8774,1.7904,0.3526,1.1241,0.5854,0.4446,2.9424,0.4174,1.5127,0.4381,2.2108,0.61,4.7103,0.5706,3.1538,2.0463,0.6277,2.0497,8.3878,1.342,0.6835,0.5937,0.0012,0.87,0.0072,3.7157,4.1796,0.335,0.0054,0.0098,0.0057,5.3558,3.9722,3.4634,4.6047,0.5745,0.0207,0.0262,4.7106,0.0046,0.04,1.822,0.0015,2.3763,0.0134,3.9352,0.0061,3.7325,1.5169,1.2609,1.5669,0.0072,1.2321,4.7854,1.694,3.6744,2.6171,0.0379,0.0108,0.0533,0.0013,0.0328,3.3419,4.3955,4.0581,4.4621,4.5928,4.0912,4.2346,4.2609,3.6856,4.7424,0.8603,0.0616,4.5351,3.9067,4.3532,3.9415,4.0284,4.1351,4.3117,3.8393,4.3771,1.2047,0.1385,0.0002,1.1503,1.6649,0.0321,0.7277,3.7633,5.3183,5.7708,0.0138,1.1232,2.9861,2.3954,0.0924,0.0005,2.7999,3.9032,2.0308,2.511,3.5656,0.0679,2.1361,0.0068,0.0422,0.4774,0.8569,0.7757,0.1347,0.1502,0.4795,1.0936,6.387,1.4863,6.5063,1.0049,4.3042,3.5594,3.9926,3.3264,3.1653,1.3678,2.8739,1.8672,1.3108,2.1705,0.0843,0.0034,0.9009,2.3183,0.5084,1.9893,5.6128,0.282,0.0044,3.9639,5.0757,0.491,1.8182,3.3261,2.5076,0.0289,3.0799,2.3454,0.9972,3.4706,0.0434,2.7805,0.9782,3.112,3.4794,4.9407,0.0038,1.4653,2.2328,2.0343,3.5076,2.184,1.1777,3.6762,0.1467,1.9406,2.3162,3.0345,0.0574,0.0455,1.7158,0.0563,0.1226,0.0006,0.4146,0.0031,3.8385,1.6421,4.0894,0.0134,0.5344,0.0423,5.606,0.2128,2.1067,0.4677,2.2095,0.7266,4.9187,0.2345,1.9868,0.648,7.6563,0.6972,2.6893,0.0068,2.271,0.4282,2.7082,0.4181,1.209,0.6163,1.332,0.0063,0.7593,2.0737,0.4253,0.0895,0.0002,0.6421,1.215,0.0182,5.8652,4.207,0.0028,2.5647,3.3808,1.9139,4.4838,0.3726,2.0066,3.6009,1.9175,1.332,1.2045,1.9632,2.0067,0.2353,0.2718,0.4658,2.3209,2.3055,4.6087,1.8343,0.0445,0.091,0.0006,1.9989,0.0017,0.0027,0.0013,0.0002,0.0011,0.0027,0.0007,6.2371,2.0744,0.0094,7.3211,1.3258,1.5999,0.0011,1.1099,1.2812,0.1354,0.4895,0.0436,0.0003,0.1767,0.0084,0.037,0.0054,0.0032,0.0137,0.0063,0.0731,0.0013,0.0038,0.0082,0.0004,0.0103,0.0612,0.0888,0.0002,0.5369,2.8367,1.2155,1.4459,1.3034,1.3438,3.1626,0.0267,0.4008,2.7124,1.6768,0.367,1.7469,0.2499,6.0411,1.5292,2.2007,0.4882,3.3751,0.6357,1.2798,4.5394,2.1869,1.1211,1.1535,0.1868,2.567,1.1525,1.9534,0.4381,0.9667,0.0301,0.0767,0.0006,0.6429,0.0046,1.9498,0.0147,0.0011,0.0018,0.0015,0.001,0.8646,0.0002,0.005,0.0002,0.0004,0.0001,0.0011,0.0218,0.0005,0.0005,0.0069,0.0006,0.0075,0.0004,0.0015,0.0006,0.0008,0.0001,0.0004,0.0029,0.0005,0.0006,0.0004,0.0105,0.0236,0.0197,0.0004,0.0001,0.0004,0.0003,0.0033,4.7918,4.0934,4.5922,3.7276,4.3828,4.3811,3.6942,4.2064,4.4109,4.2058,0.1863,0.0034,4.1419,3.9695,4.3466,3.8274,4.0174,4.2918,4.2165,4.4057,3.6203,2.0913,0.0731,0.0002,0.4443,1.1365,0.0153,0.9119,5.3609,1.9503,1.3316,0.6072,1.4001,1.6006,0.0051,3.8589,6.757,1.8557,1.1254,2.5593,1.9762,1.2028,0.8299,1.0442,0.7657,1.4441,2.4963,4.5501,2.4454,4.8457,3.1238,4.5719,4.7804,2.4364,0.482,0.2476,0.9498,1.614,0.7203,0.0046,2.8538,4.3252,1.0948,4.1387,2.3155,1.3472,0.5157,2.9951,2.7146,0.2639,0.0083,2.4272,4.8647,2.9248,4.5888,0.1411,5.3146,1.4755,1.2699,1.9487,1.1477,5.0646,5.7921,4.3076,2.1402,0.0036,2.1049,0.3023,1.9672,0.7259,2.8279,0.6836,0.0172,0.061,0.0004,0.374,0.0025,2.9823,1.42,0.918,0.0027,2.1079,0.0008,0.7556,0.0425,1.1885,0.1724,4.7735,2.0119,0.9698,0.0049,0.7641,0.9099,2.5536,3.7073,5.0213,1.2005]}
{"id":173,"ended":false,"length":556,"gen_text":"The abundance of antimony in the Earth's crust is estimated at 0 @. @ 2 to 0 @. @ 5 parts per million, comparable to thallium at 0 @. @ 3 to 0 @. @ 5 parts per million. But these figures differ greatly, depending on where you live. For example, the US government figures the US's antimony levels at 0 @. @ 70 parts per million, while the Japanese government lists it at 0 @. @ 45 parts per million.\n\nThe presence of silver in minerals is less well established, although there are some ideas. In the mid-1960s the Chinese government found that some of their silver was missing. To this day, the presence of silver in mined silver has not been completely determined. Some believe the absence of silver in China is due to the industrial development and a large influx of foreign silver in the past five decades. Others suspect this reflects less an absence of silver but instead a lack of quality control and the development of cheaper mines. It is known that in the 1970s the Chinese deliberately contaminated their silver mines with cadmium, which also occurs in silver, to make them appear safer for export. In 1985, the World Health Organisation (WHO) began to list cadmium in tin (a very low tin concentration). The WHO list is based on the United States Geological Survey which believes (based on the ratio of tin to silver) that cadmium accounts for around. @ 6. @ 12. @ 18 times the amount of the other heavy metals in the world.\n\nIn the 1970s, the New Zealand Ministry of Health (now the Health Department ) published a statement on cadmium levels in drinking water using data from their own monitoring. The Ministry found that 90 percent of their wells had cadmium levels that exceeded the New Zealand drinking water standard of 300 ppb [pH].\n\nIn the 1990s, an international study reported a correlation between cadmium level in water and exposure to cadmium. The correlation was strongest where drinking water was supplied with the most pollution. These cadmium levels tended to be higher in the most polluted regions of the world, which are typically situated in countries with the oldest agricultural practices.\n\nThe presence of cadmium in food also has been researched. Cadmium is usually found in meat from animals that has had large amounts of grain fed to them. This can be from a lack of good animal husbandry practices.\n\nSilver in food is more well researched than cadmium in water. Silver, like zinc, is an essential trace element for humans. The amount that can potentially reach the body is difficult to determine, although there are two things we can do to limit it :\n\n\u2022 Avoid foods with a very high amount of natural silver (such as oysters, strawberries and green tea)\n\n\u2022 Avoid foods with silver sulfate (as silver glues most of the additives in foods to the packaging, including aluminium)","token_len":606,"entropy":[10.7441,0.0771,8.0129,4.036,1.3001,1.1877,2.6777,0.1256,0.2004,1.3968,5.3531,1.9355,3.7173,17.7526,5.2159,8.418,4.6076,4.548,3.9174,3.9117,0.8935,1.1383,2.6508,2.6105,0.0389,0.4046,2.1552,7.6478,0.1183,7.5377,0.125,0.0004,4.077,0.4498,1.0482,0.2458,0.1038,2.5776,0.43,0.2447,0.0274,0.0517,0.0749,1.6316,0.1523,0.0034,0.0573,0.5186,4.7674,4.5787,3.0754,5.6063,2.4737,2.9092,1.3381,0.1312,3.148,1.332,2.4793,0.6081,2.2551,0.3614,0.0652,1.547,3.5865,5.502,5.5953,3.457,2.4637,3.9632,1.1944,0.0015,3.1258,0.6909,0.9538,1.6275,0.1588,0.025,5.836,0.2826,0.0046,0.1255,0.8447,1.1506,0.8,3.6202,0.3847,4.2144,1.4837,0.2018,0.6976,0.0849,0.0551,0.0098,5.1066,0.1617,0.005,0.0055,0.1969,1.2941,0.0117,2.0672,4.3331,0.0455,6.0641,0.8837,5.5038,1.2203,4.3951,0.7776,3.2514,1.0024,2.0631,2.1146,0.9477,1.6639,5.7471,1.7171,2.9373,1.6268,3.97,0.3435,3.1114,0.1034,3.5573,5.9548,1.3831,3.853,1.0739,3.311,1.3791,1.814,1.0125,2.0153,4.339,1.6287,4.8195,4.6332,0.1053,0.6462,1.5612,4.3318,0.0298,0.2341,0.3619,5.6742,0.9875,2.3765,0.6546,0.0431,4.8093,2.1573,0.3716,3.5727,3.2253,2.5346,3.0925,0.056,0.1137,1.0309,2.612,1.5649,0.654,0.0192,1.0542,5.7104,4.5793,2.6461,5.2112,4.1585,1.752,0.0157,2.57,1.641,3.1492,0.1818,2.7385,5.4943,0.8391,0.25,1.3806,3.7866,4.9429,6.7765,5.5447,5.116,1.0259,0.2249,0.0898,3.5624,3.2959,1.1208,1.8286,0.0094,5.4108,0.6593,2.8853,2.7054,5.4164,0.0372,3.8195,5.0331,0.6428,4.0632,0.5441,3.5293,0.191,3.2596,1.0036,3.635,0.0726,1.7633,1.304,6.5662,3.2502,0.8896,0.6382,1.0571,0.3569,3.3849,0.0003,0.0,1.174,1.9596,4.3735,3.4051,1.0599,2.9098,1.8809,1.3965,2.5934,0.8152,3.0588,5.6665,2.6574,2.1574,0.3242,3.6333,5.0827,0.7379,1.0147,4.0893,0.2611,2.5967,1.6752,0.0141,0.0247,4.7652,0.884,3.7509,1.0991,0.0002,0.0002,2.2281,6.3137,4.0732,2.6918,4.3,3.1409,3.8496,2.0153,4.6234,2.4452,0.9863,4.0864,1.9951,2.1757,0.1047,1.2303,5.046,1.0159,2.4387,0.0217,5.5305,5.7666,6.7798,1.4622,0.0457,1.9741,4.4776,0.094,1.7205,0.3922,0.3195,0.3698,0.1822,1.4739,0.0002,0.0002,5.0653,0.0032,3.547,8.7839,0.2494,4.2491,1.2314,2.5494,3.0164,0.557,0.7053,2.8201,4.4875,0.9124,1.2598,0.0918,4.9323,2.3951,5.0272,0.2676,1.5677,1.1243,3.0132,1.4506,0.901,0.0002,2.8759,1.4468,2.6329,0.0306,0.7032,1.0944,6.2663,0.9521,2.7411,0.1829,0.596,2.9337,2.3158,1.0311,2.6358,1.6253,6.1411,3.6185,0.6173,5.5501,1.9921,2.9267,0.0008,0.0014,3.3023,0.1347,2.4011,0.0361,6.358,2.3615,0.3229,3.7968,2.1865,2.1793,1.8847,1.2296,1.1423,2.5069,0.6287,5.8384,1.8124,0.0164,2.9172,3.2703,1.1868,1.6049,0.0002,0.0002,0.3167,3.3074,0.6182,0.4049,2.4113,0.0021,1.4384,0.0281,0.6623,1.1895,5.124,2.0759,0.001,5.3403,2.5508,2.6853,1.5656,2.577,0.0002,1.8784,1.5193,2.8644,0.0339,0.3298,4.1837,1.5508,1.7882,4.0874,2.5866,2.6035,0.0606,0.9954,0.0004,0.0004,5.1759,0.7244,2.6011,0.1733,4.9643,0.3079,1.5116,0.0023,0.0001,3.7863,1.2917,3.8239,0.7636,2.5968,4.4066,3.5513,0.0614,0.7834,3.6024,3.7206,3.0461,2.2002,4.8433,1.0354,4.4153,4.266,0.0005,0.0008,0.7432,5.4474,0.0155,0.498,1.6559,0.3719,2.1971,3.7163,0.2144,1.9508,1.2067,0.8815,0.3091,1.3965,3.6586,2.4658,3.3959,5.8932,0.8935,2.919,0.9186,2.5897,5.3559,4.3387,1.6186,0.6294,1.0337,0.0002,1.9892,2.4823,0.0264,3.0239,0.0005,0.0002,0.2776,3.3691,5.1069,1.3877,0.7572,3.7344,0.4837,1.6957,0.0008,0.0008,0.8302,4.9687,1.4127,0.1551,4.7072,2.5403,0.764,0.7795,5.3152,3.1733,4.0973,0.5449,0.0108,3.9473,1.3016,0.1883,0.5531,0.737,2.7133,2.9717,1.8026,2.8706,2.8301,2.8449,0.0081,4.6715,2.8186,0.0494,0.0007,1.113,1.8031,1.9404,0.0002,5.4408,2.8504,1.0935,1.2461,3.6446,2.6874,3.4286,2.091,0.4118,0.0001,0.0011,1.6006,0.794,0.3813,2.261,4.1064,1.8396,5.6115,0.2957,0.4487,2.6448,0.4847,1.0502,0.3995,1.9075,1.7395,0.5516,2.492,3.1341,3.7623,2.3953,7.0732,3.9292,0.7727,2.0723,1.0724,5.1796,0.0207,1.4071,1.3094,2.6485,2.561,0.8866,4.2506,4.9702,2.6787,0.3503,1.4898,0.6664,2.6982,2.2827,6.7857,0.3524,0.0002,3.8053,2.0587,2.6296,1.595,1.9034,3.7771,0.1281,2.3531,0.0427,6.8861,0.7381,1.7352,1.6349,0.003,3.4524,0.0529,0.8291,4.5051,1.3218,3.4751,1.477,0.9057,0.4388,0.0002,0.0108,1.879,0.8863,0.8532,3.199,3.5657,1.1681,0.9126,4.5446,3.8772,4.0653,3.2422,5.2237,3.1266,0.3327,5.4017,0.9679,1.8947,2.2321,1.3552,5.0857,2.0506,3.0025,5.3904,2.045]}
{"id":3056,"ended":false,"length":509,"gen_text":"Sometime during the sixth season of The X @ - @ Files, Anderson approached series creator Chris Carter and asked to write an episode. Anderson's own beliefs in the power of spiritualism played a huge role in the way that she portrayed the character.\n\nBut what's so special about this episode? In the premiere, we meet the three-headed Serpent, whose head is played by Anderson's own father, Robert.\n\nIn the episode, we're introduced to the three Serpent heads.\n\nIt is a very odd, and at times bizarre, episode. The Serpent has no powers or abilities beyond his ability to see, and he spends most of the episode sleeping and occasionally hallucinating; he never speaks but is able to see into the minds of others. A few of the episode's scenes don't last nearly as long as the rest, but while they do, they come together like some kind of weird dream. In one scene, during the Serpent's vision, he sees what appears to be his father, an old man who also has multiple heads. After this bizarre scene, the series takes its rightful time setting up the rest of the show, as we meet several characters.\n\nAnderson's father, like the Serpent, is a spiritualist, but there's no attempt to use the supernatural for comedic effect. His entire life has been tied up in this, with only now realizing how far he's gone. At the beginning of the show, this man starts to find out what the life of the Serpent is like. At first, he tries to live as a normal life, but that isn't easy, and soon he will face his problems head-on.\n\nThis is not a season 1 episode for Anderson. Her writing style is much different from what makes up this part of The X Files, even when the show is at its funniest. She likes to have a lot of tension, where her characters are always on edge, especially the characters on her father's team. And unlike what she did with the Season 9 episode, \"Chariots of Fire,\" which features Anderson's character as a character who thinks she is a mermaid, this episode is set up to be a classic Chris Carter episode where the series jumps back and forth in time between 1984 and 2000.\n\nThe episode deals with some classic The X-Files horror tropes and some modern twists, making it a must-watch if you just can't wait for the final 10 episodes.\n\nFor More Info:\n\nWebsite : http:\/\/www.scrippshill.org\/anthonyanderson\n\nEmail: anthonyandre1@gmail.com\n\nTwitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/anthonyanderson\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/scrippshill\n\nBlog: http:\/\/www.somadmedia.com\/anthonyandre\/\n\nBuy Episodes: http:\/\/www.thexfiles.com\/buy","token_len":606,"entropy":[8.5873,2.7516,0.5571,7.2112,2.455,1.3318,2.3955,2.9309,15.3215,8.4132,5.089,10.6865,0.5668,8.4311,7.4194,6.6874,0.4915,2.5947,0.0339,1.435,0.8438,2.4326,2.3605,1.9767,0.0506,1.1461,2.7191,1.8418,6.4138,8.5561,3.9104,0.9442,5.2552,0.0465,6.3824,1.0273,5.215,0.3309,3.3971,0.5533,0.0485,1.0144,4.4528,1.7222,4.0613,4.0845,1.0554,1.4178,1.0783,1.1993,0.0084,5.6048,2.8797,2.6649,2.8051,2.1217,0.0227,2.2085,1.0001,0.8276,3.7209,1.8909,4.8802,0.4327,1.849,1.8233,2.1027,5.2753,3.3294,0.872,5.1288,1.5586,3.1919,3.3184,0.5411,5.1746,0.0172,3.3188,1.8106,2.156,2.6702,0.9056,4.4068,2.1696,2.3881,0.0002,2.7194,0.9912,1.1368,0.2706,1.8798,3.356,0.3368,0.0046,1.1426,2.8636,2.1602,0.7089,2.5005,1.7478,0.0002,4.4118,3.2712,2.5231,2.7946,4.9035,2.9154,2.5262,3.723,0.2335,3.3266,0.5402,1.1995,0.5443,2.2753,1.8827,3.8511,3.4847,5.2505,2.9584,1.2905,2.8963,1.1145,1.5436,0.0076,3.8866,2.587,1.2429,1.3566,4.2198,0.6688,0.007,0.2883,0.1669,5.3779,2.5839,5.1083,3.9763,0.0185,5.9159,1.439,5.1062,1.872,4.9441,2.6999,2.6092,0.0043,3.6062,4.7298,0.4741,0.7584,0.0445,1.2401,0.4079,6.0802,2.4318,2.37,0.4313,3.6915,0.0185,1.9039,6.1175,0.0005,6.5346,5.4913,0.6607,0.0056,0.0579,1.9583,1.4705,1.2333,0.9523,6.6057,1.5336,2.7062,1.2564,0.7334,5.7928,2.3876,4.3972,4.3023,1.4305,0.0032,3.3721,1.7191,1.6777,4.2238,1.3474,0.5953,0.1088,6.6204,1.7113,2.6754,0.0815,3.3035,0.7683,1.5881,1.1056,4.9357,1.1077,0.0064,0.0133,2.4359,2.3766,1.2807,5.5076,1.3036,0.2909,1.543,5.4506,1.4201,5.1102,0.1231,0.4069,4.8991,2.893,5.2731,0.9776,0.1533,0.7808,4.7563,2.8623,4.1527,5.8479,4.5996,3.2431,0.1035,0.6526,1.3571,0.0037,0.0628,4.4859,1.2937,3.3572,1.7271,2.9908,3.8648,1.3872,3.1723,0.5616,0.0002,3.46,1.0935,1.0614,1.6357,5.6547,1.054,0.657,0.1866,0.9736,1.1204,3.6272,0.1468,1.4154,2.401,4.8664,0.9553,2.9884,5.8619,0.4498,5.0423,1.6291,2.1637,2.4232,4.3426,0.498,0.379,3.7441,5.1069,2.0839,1.6787,0.1799,5.5681,0.8325,0.4115,2.7035,3.2727,4.3477,5.4632,6.7554,3.4684,2.0986,3.3093,0.9164,0.5438,1.4572,0.4663,4.9547,1.2367,1.4275,0.0962,0.0521,3.2677,0.0553,4.9128,3.6931,5.9417,1.6433,5.1592,0.9998,2.4154,2.6107,6.2844,0.3729,3.2802,0.6418,1.109,0.6352,0.9901,4.6215,1.2262,0.2707,0.6818,2.8075,0.0677,3.8433,2.5679,1.2084,0.7706,3.023,0.5609,0.7392,4.1846,4.0453,0.0003,2.1489,1.8823,1.078,3.015,0.6561,4.8191,2.8884,2.0868,5.8025,0.1248,0.9768,0.002,0.2072,0.6042,0.0002,3.0776,1.1728,3.8189,1.0659,5.6348,3.8302,0.3028,3.2113,1.0569,0.9732,3.1513,4.5349,2.2553,0.8411,2.7263,1.5865,1.1371,1.6313,6.4114,0.5608,3.1993,4.8381,0.0081,2.3016,0.0019,0.5224,1.1161,5.2906,3.6195,2.6607,1.2919,0.9202,2.7559,0.1525,3.2329,0.0221,0.1324,2.6459,4.7572,0.175,2.8633,1.2017,1.5356,0.1182,5.467,1.7511,5.5713,3.6181,0.9682,0.8864,3.2588,1.3833,0.877,1.2411,4.5651,1.7207,2.0645,2.879,3.6053,1.1005,0.0129,2.3509,0.3128,4.0291,5.0515,3.5498,3.0546,1.7022,1.4141,1.1386,5.0381,4.0289,1.6144,1.1881,1.2095,5.0291,2.959,0.0659,0.0302,0.009,0.2335,1.9462,4.4101,4.5124,0.9957,1.7282,2.3935,0.7277,4.3638,2.3515,5.3281,0.5505,1.9933,1.6313,5.3794,0.0032,0.2601,0.8823,0.5595,1.0261,4.5977,1.3361,2.2836,0.9224,0.9382,5.3548,4.3423,0.0009,0.5352,4.3018,1.391,3.5497,5.343,1.5979,0.2496,0.0071,1.8563,0.0328,2.5473,4.9421,0.0685,4.5358,0.2836,0.7788,0.0002,1.7341,1.8091,5.8087,0.107,2.9863,4.0705,4.4538,0.0017,1.5957,0.0157,4.5666,1.0489,3.8013,4.093,2.6695,4.582,1.8523,5.2825,0.5849,0.8492,3.3159,0.2245,0.4179,3.1082,0.0539,6.3978,0.5924,0.0085,1.7291,0.5713,0.9201,4.5143,4.3359,0.2172,1.3393,0.7631,0.0002,4.3228,5.2584,4.0205,0.6618,0.6083,0.0002,5.3651,5.0566,0.9152,0.0008,0.3998,0.0016,5.436,5.3195,6.8289,4.5984,0.9602,1.5208,0.2446,5.7139,0.9949,1.4007,0.0011,1.303,0.0002,5.1441,1.1941,0.2332,0.0026,4.3582,4.0782,0.0556,0.4822,0.0022,0.0016,0.2023,0.0002,0.7748,0.2635,2.8438,0.0009,1.5362,0.0012,0.0081,0.0017,0.0004,0.008,0.9418,0.0035,0.4769,0.0742,0.461,0.0002,0.8869,0.1596,0.5589,0.0007,0.0237,0.0009,0.0086,0.0019,0.0004,0.0022,2.9494,0.0155,0.2159,0.016,0.6706,0.0002,4.9031,0.3125,0.0618,0.0006,0.9478,0.0011,5.1833,5.3933,4.7635,5.7491,0.0864,0.2548,0.188,1.331,0.0052,1.0321,1.5537,0.5754,0.0002,5.2444,5.0044,0.0059,0.8295,0.2415,0.0003,0.2377,0.0012,3.902,0.1778,0.002,0.1708,0.4971,0.0569,3.6998]}
{"id":841,"ended":true,"length":533,"gen_text":"The name Giacomo Meyerbeer first became known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto \u2014 premiered in Venice in 1824 and produced in London and Paris in 1825 ; incidentally, it was the final performance of one of Giacomo's major operas. During the 1820's he completed other dramatic works such as La dolce vita in La dolce vita, a comedy of manners based on an actual event.\nWith this brief history of Meyerbeer's life and works it is perhaps not surprising that he is most often associated with the composer Giubert Bartoli, but actually his works are inter-related. His operas are generally divided into three phases. In the first, he was primarily concerned with creating characters for opera: the tragic hero ; the virtuous wife of a prince ; or the love-struck nobleman, all of whom he created with his naturalistic eyes. It was in this period that he developed ideas that found their way into the later Romantic period, which he developed, with Bartoli, using naturalistic methods to show a humanity and authenticity in his characters. This early work in the field of the opera is largely ignored by Meyerbeer scholars, for not many have found it to be as strong as it has been thought.\nThe second phase of Meyerbeer's opera-making came after Bartoli, who was also his teacher, had passed away in 1834. It is during this period that we begin to see Meyerbeer begin to develop his trademark expressionist approach. The work of Giacomo Meyerbeer, following Giubert Bartoli, is an expressive movement of composition, characterized by a direct, naturalistic approach that shows no hesitation to depict characters using the simplest, most accessible material available. In his final years, Meyerbeer used this expressionism in his work at the Met, which has been characterized by a bold, powerful voice that is highly stylized and expressive. The third phase of Meyerbeer's work is that of an American composer, and it was at the Met that his work reached its most formative years.\nFrom the 1890's onward, during his first period of work in America, Meyerbeer, through Bartoli, had an increasingly larger impact on the American music scene. The Met and other American theatres became increasingly important in the world of American music, and the movement of American composers to New York City further propelled the development of Meyerbeer and the American Opera, which has now become one of the most important and influential music styles of the twentieth century.\nIf you are going to read, study, or study some of Giacomo Meyerbeer's music, I would suggest the following three books:\nGiacomo Meyerbeer - A Biography, by Alan Glynn - One of the more useful biographies ever written for a composer, this book is well done and the author knows his subject very well. Definitely must-read for anyone interested in writing a biography on a composer.","token_len":606,"entropy":[6.5626,10.2156,2.052,0.1915,7.8941,1.7116,5.4025,3.8328,0.9491,5.1712,2.8038,0.6962,6.2961,6.8917,9.6329,5.2411,1.0299,4.5012,11.0598,1.3293,8.2328,7.5105,0.3398,3.4366,0.3563,1.7563,5.6374,2.055,4.3106,0.5559,1.5461,2.2362,1.222,1.7321,0.252,1.4677,10.1132,9.0867,0.5675,1.9245,0.5699,1.865,5.701,2.5497,0.1971,4.0481,0.0595,3.4438,0.0152,0.0034,3.194,5.1623,0.5821,0.0162,1.3478,4.9397,0.6128,2.6541,0.3918,1.9741,1.6767,5.9404,5.3934,5.4094,0.502,2.9822,0.0087,2.6931,3.5647,0.3864,0.0016,0.3795,0.0073,2.0837,5.4177,4.696,0.1062,0.0007,0.1704,0.0699,1.5808,3.3961,3.8711,2.427,0.7829,3.2297,0.1265,3.5581,3.3559,2.4355,2.6499,2.3543,8.9356,3.3202,5.3756,2.9661,0.6228,1.0685,0.0045,0.7286,0.8154,1.4484,1.4036,2.3237,0.5102,3.3162,2.366,0.6628,0.1488,2.1267,1.3456,4.0383,1.5852,1.5325,0.0584,0.857,4.8363,2.5867,5.7738,0.0208,2.9066,1.3086,1.519,3.3077,5.8716,2.9545,2.1989,1.694,5.1306,2.5674,0.2827,1.5198,3.5405,2.7026,0.0521,1.5351,4.2145,3.1558,0.1208,1.1593,4.5047,2.297,2.1325,0.1398,0.1617,1.5633,2.9752,1.8947,2.7698,1.8775,0.0289,4.2735,5.0315,2.339,2.9102,3.4085,2.1598,4.0591,1.2095,6.7079,0.1269,4.9842,2.4692,3.8723,1.0766,3.0917,0.485,3.1656,0.2703,5.1578,1.254,1.0476,0.0008,3.8876,0.2712,3.667,2.7763,0.5039,0.1659,3.2277,2.675,1.8126,3.2034,4.4231,1.1278,5.3178,0.8145,4.9505,0.8743,1.5445,0.7371,1.8081,0.3541,0.929,2.6814,6.9288,2.7669,6.1944,0.8437,0.7516,0.0821,1.7673,2.2401,3.0038,1.3414,1.6684,3.6211,1.691,4.7982,5.523,2.7927,1.618,0.0715,0.2256,6.2633,4.5008,0.2055,2.3429,2.8838,4.9498,3.2924,5.7883,1.9452,4.9923,1.4551,1.1257,1.2324,0.3984,3.579,5.6868,3.2141,3.9356,1.1115,3.136,0.1612,3.1148,3.218,1.5456,4.5216,2.8207,0.9473,2.2094,0.0015,1.7663,0.8712,4.6054,6.4194,2.3847,2.986,4.6803,1.0533,2.0286,0.1446,2.2719,3.7634,0.5068,2.4,3.9636,0.5521,3.0075,1.251,1.4086,1.2876,0.192,0.1417,0.8039,0.3512,0.0025,0.0411,1.3299,2.487,0.1904,4.2526,2.8464,2.6594,0.0157,2.4588,3.0103,1.8786,3.4749,2.422,2.9873,0.727,1.7363,2.9546,0.1021,0.997,0.353,3.2037,0.295,2.9611,1.5917,1.5815,0.0406,0.4781,0.2066,5.016,2.3797,0.0076,0.3249,2.1582,0.0051,3.4973,0.0542,1.8574,0.82,5.7883,5.7682,2.2641,4.7324,2.3603,2.3605,4.3607,1.193,4.9667,0.1464,0.0064,0.1943,0.0012,2.2918,6.4045,2.8298,1.8658,0.0003,0.0162,0.0166,0.2483,1.0547,3.6767,4.0982,4.6423,2.2261,4.9538,1.2331,3.9169,0.0756,1.6486,5.373,1.4939,2.7002,0.1389,1.5944,2.8494,4.3048,4.1964,4.9435,1.5118,3.5165,3.5304,5.4809,2.3541,4.0095,2.8062,0.7058,4.9386,5.3455,1.8614,0.4679,2.7314,2.6584,4.6728,1.2926,0.7362,0.6456,0.0017,3.7662,2.4964,2.9994,1.6474,1.8551,1.2105,3.217,5.1658,0.6421,3.655,0.7062,2.5462,3.5261,1.6388,3.7839,0.5947,1.4506,3.9505,1.2041,5.0235,4.2542,1.7043,1.6698,4.9219,1.9929,0.0482,1.3645,2.5302,0.5484,2.5365,2.2902,0.2419,0.3206,0.1773,0.0037,0.0338,2.479,1.6604,3.3767,0.301,5.1583,5.5538,1.1294,1.0836,2.3034,2.1358,2.22,3.2167,0.7239,1.0557,0.9124,2.8717,2.5072,3.3252,0.3163,2.301,5.5303,0.1603,2.3094,0.3016,2.0112,5.0889,1.0572,5.0281,0.1962,2.6302,0.4141,5.4133,1.5401,3.6529,3.3311,0.8817,2.9871,1.7498,0.9721,0.1142,0.2193,0.0015,4.7634,3.7315,1.8162,0.0145,0.3653,2.655,5.1692,3.8634,4.7323,4.457,0.5986,0.7979,0.6776,2.12,0.6715,0.4586,2.5999,3.3262,3.5821,1.9496,1.3366,3.6278,0.0007,2.8227,3.9746,2.2027,1.6406,0.6159,4.0233,0.1252,2.4469,0.7816,0.7578,0.4843,2.3692,5.6217,0.6975,1.8419,2.5238,0.0022,1.5042,2.6151,0.0064,1.1238,5.6716,5.0592,2.1348,1.9153,0.0261,0.8582,0.0039,3.9638,2.9011,1.6971,4.7651,3.4531,1.6964,3.3048,3.4965,0.9036,1.4619,0.0066,0.0488,0.5357,1.188,1.9067,0.9919,3.0766,2.7094,1.2797,0.4238,1.3233,0.0257,0.0557,0.6774,5.8534,0.6216,2.3235,6.0307,0.0094,2.1737,5.7002,1.6616,0.479,0.4286,2.8306,4.1691,0.4771,2.0678,0.0253,0.0034,0.0184,0.0039,0.0212,1.2957,0.2067,1.5456,1.4227,1.802,2.4829,0.3523,3.0395,1.3428,0.7696,0.4205,3.2686,0.0973,0.002,0.0159,0.0016,3.0563,2.1461,0.7376,0.0579,2.8119,0.6041,5.1139,4.2974,3.7457,4.0443,5.7435,0.0465,0.1664,3.0684,4.4136,1.1481,0.0136,3.9419,0.115,3.793,1.6481,0.9108,1.1269,1.4315,0.7394,1.3779,3.583,4.2594,0.4996,4.2252,0.7447,4.8598,0.6746,1.1024,1.3842,0.0358,0.1749,6.5099,5.8182,1.6022,0.7863,0.948,1.2716,0.6174,0.0165,6.4946,0.9405,0.0953,2.8656,0.5052,0.6477,0.3881]}

{"id":1922,"ended":false,"length":465,"gen_text":"One of the first details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, \"There is much that remains controversial about the paleonodon (Iggy), including its primary feeding method and evidence for its relationship with extant crocodiles...\"\n\nAn interesting finding was that the new animal did not have any obvious bone-cracking behaviour. Mantell notes that this is unlike its giant carnivorous ancestors.\n\n\"One possibility is that Iguanodon was not a species-specific 'killer' but actually specialized in being a member of a larger group of predators who were herbivores but also had very specialized diet...\" It has since been suggested, with some certainty, that this new species may have been a member of the long-snouted ornithodirans (the reptile relatives of lizards) that are thought to have lived during the Miocene era and probably preyed on mammals. It remains to be explored however whether modern dinosaurs were capable of making this lifestyle switch during the Mesozoic era. This may well have been a lifestyle change that took place in groups that were not closely related to the early dinosaurs, as it has been suggested that members of earlier groups might have already started the switch to herbivorous lifestyles, making Iguanodon's lifestyle change seem to have been quite recent...\n\n\"Given that there are no fossil reptiles that provide direct evidence for a true mammalian diet of any period (the Paleoproterozoic), as well as the lack of any direct evidence for large predators like Iguanodon, it is likely that theropod diets changed during the Mesozoic.\" The Paleoproterozoic Era, as noted above, is when Iguanodon is believed to have lived, a period in which Iguanodon may not have been part of the larger groups that typically preyed on mammals;\n\nThe latest Iguanodon fossil was found in 2001 in the Oligocene of Peru. In November 2010, it was found in the Maastrichtian of South Africa, about 250 million years from today. This has made the discovery of the new herbivorous dinosaur particularly exciting, with the team looking to obtain more samples of the species.

{"id":924,"ended":false,"length":561,"gen_text":"During the post @ - @ independence period, Mogadishu International Airport offered flights to numerous global destinations. In the mid @ - @ 1960s, the airport was enlarged to accommodate more international passenger traffic. The aircraft are the largest ever imported to Somalia. During the post- independence era, the Airport expanded its services to accommodate more international passenger traffic.\n- The first airline to operate a daily regular flight into Mogadishu, was Air Somalia. Air Somalia had its origin after the establishment of the International Airport. Air Somalia, a joint venture between Air Sahara, Air Kenya and TransAfrica, operated the following airlines flights into the Mogadishu International Airport from 1969 to 1985, including : Airlines serving Mogadishu International Airport between 1969 and 1986 : United Airlines, Air Asia, Airtours, South African Airways, Air Madagascar, Lusaka Airways, TransAfrican Air Services, East Africa African Airways, African Airlines Ltd., Egypt Airway, Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian and TransAfrica Air services between 1986 and early 1990s: Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian, Ethiopian Airways, Ethiopian Airways, Ethiopian Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Eastern Ethiopian Airways. Later on, on October 9, 1991, Somali Airlines set a new record when they flew 575 flights, with 949 passengers, into the Mogadishu International Airport.\n- The airport was also the principal international gateway for the African Union's peacekeeping forces. This role was taken over by the newly formed Somali government after Somalia's independence from Ethiopia. The Somali government has gradually increased its role, even at the expense of the Somali people. The airport was the main source of revenue for the local and foreign governments of Somalia. During the post - - independence period, the airport has not been able to continue, so Somalia has largely been left in poverty. Somalia has recently been faced with the greatest humanitarian crisis since the famine of the 1980's.\n- Mogadishu International Airport's importance as a cultural gateway was well known through the history of Mogadishu. The city was often used for cultural exchange events with the neighboring regions, especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.\nToday's Airport, in pictures:\nToday's World class Airport, the biggest facility in Somalia, has a grand architectural style. It features a mix of modern and old structures, some of them built from local stones. The oldest one is the old Municipal building. This building can be seen, on the picture above, it is situated to the right of the runway entrance runway.

{"id":313,"ended":false,"length":452,"gen_text":"After the Russian victory against Sweden in 1743, the Swedes established a commission to identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed \"great repairs\". The commission therefore recommended that Russia build Fort Pustystuk (Sauna) with improved defenses for Karelia and Sverdlovsk to protect the newly founded capital of St Petersburg. The Swedes were unhappy with these suggestions and the commission was disbanded after just six months of operations.\n\nFort Pustystuk was built in 1749 and consisted of 60 rooms and 6,000 square meters (40,000 square yards). Construction began in 1750 and the fort was finished two years later. The walls were 13 meters high, with a 4.5 meter deep moat and a brick facade. The stone buildings included quarters for officers and a chapel. The military facilities included large cannons, towers and fortifications. The northern end of Pustystuk was enclosed by a moat, and there were a number of defensive towers.\n\nFort Pustystuk was only a part of the larger Karelian defenses of Fort Karelia. It was later enlarged and renamed Karelia Fortress. The fortress served from 1755 to 1768 during the Russian campaigns in the War of the Polish Succession. The northern end (the upper part of the fort) served as the capital city and the lower part was used as an armory. The southern end of Pustystuk (the lower part) served as barracks for Russian soldiers. The upper part of Fort Pustystuk and Fort Karelia together served as the border with Sweden from 1761 to 1765 and as the border between Finland and Russia during the First Campaign in the Winter of 1757-59. Pustystuk was also used during the War of the Spanish Succession (1703-14), as well as during World War I.\n\nThe Swedish authorities were unable to defend Karelia against the Soviet assault, and with the fall of the Soviet Empire, Karelia was turned over to the Russian regime; at present it is part of the Republic of Tuvalu.\n\nSources and \/ References:\n\nThe Siege of Fort Pustystuk, by Dr. Robert Heiligenstein, University of Calgary (1987).\n\nKonstantinos Karyoussi, \"The Siege of Pustystuk (Sauna)\", in \"The Great War in International History Online Encyclopedia, Vol. 11, 2008, http:\/\/www.gwu.edu\/~nsarchiv\/NSAE\/NSAE11\/KAR\/KAR\/Pustystuk.html\n\n\"History of Fort Pustystuk\", by Konstantinos Karyoussis, on the website of the \"Fort Karelia Museum\", http:\/\/blog.fortkarelia.info\/blog\/","token_len":607,"entropy":[1.9443,7.2085,6.015,4.9451,5.379,1.3121,8.6135,5.9397,0.3179,1.2453,2.252,0.0076,4.6879,0.9732,8.5532,0.6902,5.9294,7.2683,0.2098,0.7685,8.592,3.0005,0.8696,2.5565,0.8324,2.6521,0.5715,1.0871,1.9188,3.1791,0.0816,0.7105,4.6428,0.2059,2.4499,8.1643,2.2673,4.8026,3.42,3.2314,3.4562,2.6501,1.554,1.9927,4.6865,2.3552,0.8735,4.6025,2.1913,4.4915,4.3375,3.2349,3.1791,4.2308,2.3957,2.1238,4.4191,5.1456,1.3284,4.7003,6.3051,1.2901,4.1743,6.0985,0.2816,0.1742,2.0383,4.0836,2.838,0.0062,0.0114,0.0124,4.6235,1.6959,0.8354,5.4431,3.3456,3.4134,0.9761,2.2574,1.6757,0.4948,1.6561,3.7979,0.0024,2.2008,5.1022,0.6865,3.3284,2.908,1.0151,3.0065,1.7175,0.7386,1.0633,3.533,3.8699,2.5985,0.1711,2.863,3.8854,0.1968,0.79,0.0144,2.8423,0.2547,0.0009,0.0023,0.0012,0.0037,0.8228,1.9702,0.7884,0.3666,2.1175,1.6401,4.7133,0.0212,6.2368,4.97,1.5369,4.8439,1.7681,0.5253,0.8631,0.2228,2.3933,4.6769,0.4631,0.1858,0.5079,2.879,1.143,4.5785,1.6184,0.2696,0.8325,1.236,0.6113,1.8091,0.6249,0.3325,2.1018,4.3163,0.0311,0.0197,0.2096,1.0183,2.8235,0.5513,4.5177,0.8305,1.7457,1.7274,2.7334,1.4214,4.962,1.7956,0.5665,0.2844,2.6964,0.2466,0.0006,1.2198,1.0314,5.7932,5.8706,0.4265,0.6643,5.4036,3.8294,2.8122,5.7912,0.4764,1.8194,1.0516,2.8976,2.5355,0.7336,0.8816,5.8842,4.8406,0.7552,5.8687,3.7538,0.6818,4.6379,1.6425,3.4269,0.0803,0.5129,1.0334,5.7833,2.6883,0.1109,3.8067,0.0007,0.0043,0.0025,0.0041,0.7844,5.2106,0.4758,0.3772,1.5834,0.0023,1.8442,1.8174,3.5462,0.7113,3.3018,0.7722,0.0027,3.3612,1.4306,1.256,1.7423,0.0002,1.9719,0.0881,0.0011,0.0018,0.0004,0.0015,0.535,4.7544,2.59,2.6267,0.0074,0.4975,2.8332,3.5624,0.0842,0.0527,2.0262,3.8094,2.0854,3.3958,1.2669,0.1469,1.0302,3.2847,0.4341,4.4332,3.1141,1.3668,2.6635,3.1947,0.2497,1.0597,1.6581,0.9984,1.5487,2.0405,3.8645,5.6814,0.2078,2.8919,0.4748,0.2593,3.8196,3.8468,0.1883,1.9516,3.754,1.5326,1.4592,4.1472,0.0126,1.2962,1.9136,0.0053,0.0001,0.4958,1.9715,4.6866,1.0776,5.5797,2.4751,5.1663,0.9959,1.4249,0.2964,0.9254,0.2496,3.6782,0.0954,1.3892,3.8462,3.1769,3.3673,1.3074,3.5315,0.46,1.7878,0.521,0.4425,2.9176,2.9419,0.0388,0.6783,1.3,4.0213,0.5351,1.4908,2.9,0.001,0.0019,0.0008,0.0027,2.8064,0.1986,0.7337,0.1704,0.9337,0.9759,0.0404,3.3156,1.2942,3.0581,0.83,0.6868,1.5438,3.1058,0.5097,0.4433,3.0897,0.7015,0.0008,0.0011,0.0005,0.002,4.2082,2.6396,0.0274,0.0012,0.0024,3.369,2.2321,0.072,0.6128,4.3159,2.7481,0.7234,2.8471,0.1717,3.4535,0.249,0.1805,2.4115,2.8025,1.6035,0.8464,1.2615,1.0615,2.2178,0.0304,0.4326,3.0243,0.0999,4.1633,4.2822,2.7766,1.7958,3.1825,0.6294,0.0892,2.9744,0.5833,2.8266,0.0664,4.8667,0.0083,0.0025,0.0009,0.0034,0.497,1.9945,0.6459,1.927,0.1135,2.7713,0.014,0.8289,2.2516,0.0001,0.0007,2.4402,0.0533,4.6543,0.0574,1.689,2.3098,2.1446,1.8394,0.0073,0.2694,3.9225,0.0268,0.2489,0.7307,0.6723,0.0002,1.8048,3.6087,5.4926,2.7366,4.1207,0.0081,3.8054,2.0731,0.0031,0.0069,1.1803,0.6083,5.647,4.6374,3.0505,0.8566,5.7125,0.4209,1.792,0.0025,1.4293,3.1328,3.5157,1.516,1.6343,0.002,0.2785,0.8691,4.6935,0.2621,0.0119,1.0335,1.732,6.3306,7.0143,5.6944,5.569,1.8267,0.1573,1.6991,0.0024,0.8543,2.385,0.0054,3.6825,7.4369,0.0456,0.1375,0.7256,0.0002,3.2166,2.7783,5.0609,2.6403,1.0229,0.3131,0.0002,2.9963,4.225,0.067,0.9187,0.0983,0.0006,0.0038,0.0025,0.0222,1.3548,1.7011,4.6494,0.1193,4.3044,6.2062,3.6518,4.0699,0.2415,0.6761,3.463,0.0368,5.4721,3.1644,4.1525,1.1622,0.2042,0.0002,2.878,6.3512,1.0584,3.4842,3.0476,4.0333,5.361,6.492,0.5941,1.9171,1.3505,1.7176,0.0549,1.9922,0.0016,0.0163,0.0064,0.0599,3.7226,1.2715,0.0015,1.4887,1.4996,3.6903,1.4092,3.7124,1.2398,1.4777,5.4113,1.0872,7.491,2.6281,2.0503,2.965,0.1616,3.6316,0.4592,3.8023,1.399,1.391,0.0018,0.3523,0.0081,1.112,0.4037,0.0035,0.0003,0.0103,0.0043,0.221,0.0006,0.0009,0.0071,0.0509,0.0001,0.5938,0.0236,0.0011,0.5809,0.0753,2.7501,4.4235,1.0136,1.2192,0.7241,4.7149,1.9546,0.1689,0.0341,0.1032,0.2533,0.3485,1.0651,0.8434,0.0002,2.1271,4.7627,0.1153,1.3771,0.153,0.001,0.0041,0.0029,0.0152,0.5766,1.7457,2.6627,0.0011,0.0225,0.0552,0.0014,0.0045,4.4822,0.267,4.8891,0.9755,1.7572,0.34,0.2789,5.248,3.305,3.4776,0.0155,0.0923,2.044,0.8357,0.7711,0.0007,7.7025,0.0321,1.2977,0.3165,0.0446,0.11,0.1396,2.8141,0.1159,2.8954,0.3135]}
{"id":1041,"ended":false,"length":522,"gen_text":"Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to the Scottish kings.\n\n\nThis is not just gold on the walls of the temples. Many of the objects mentioned here have been found in the temples. There are numerous objects in the tombs as well - most of them have never been seen before.\n\n\nSilver ornaments are not rare : the most significant is the'T' on the North Wall where it formed part of the northern wall, and the four gold bands or buttons. The T was always on the upper north wall but most of the smaller buttons had never been found. It has since been replaced with a silver one.\n\n\nSome of the silver ornaments on the stone tombs are very fine. Although the quality is probably variable from person to person, it is clear that silver was found in great numbers and used extensively.\n\n\nIn Pictlan, there is evidence of fine pendants and necklaces :\n\n\nThe very best examples of these are silver pendants found in a Pictish tomb which is known as the'Queen's Tombs '. At least two of these pendants are silver.\n\n\nThere is another bronze pendant, one of the finest found in Britain which was found in the'Queen's Tombs'- the earliest bronze'necklace'found in the British Isles!\n\n\nIn the Pictlan tomb there is a bronze necklace of two pearls, a brooch as well as a gold brooch. There are also some silver and bronze pendants and necklaces as well - the first silver pendant found in Britain was the'Queen's Necklace, a jewellery brooch of ivory with an ivory and bronze decoration. It is in very good condition.\n\n\nIt is clear that most of the jewellery items in the graves were used to make ornaments for the burials. All of the brooches and pendants have been fitted with brooches, which were used by the dead person to hold objects in the grave.\n\n\nThe pictures that follow are an un-chronological compilation made from many photographs of the same object or objects.\n\n\nSome of the items have been removed and some are in the original location but their condition is not good.\n\n\nThe first item below is a very large ring of silver. It is likely to date from about 1200 - 1320 AD. It has a beautiful pattern and is quite heavy. The second example appears to be a large silver brooch. Many of the larger rings are silver but it is unlikely that there would be a complete example from any group without at least one with silver.\n\n\nA few other items have been found within the tombs - these have not been shown here but have been included in their own pages.\n\nMany of the items are worn by burials and are in good condition :","token_len":607,"entropy":[5.0765,9.9031,6.6344,4.5395,1.8891,2.432,4.4427,10.964,1.4759,1.3308,2.1109,8.2189,2.7889,1.1455,5.3618,0.0429,0.0438,2.7499,1.2254,4.7768,1.7657,0.0251,5.5472,5.4203,1.5942,4.2472,2.5524,5.7316,7.6687,1.6037,2.0885,3.4286,4.1371,8.5258,0.3858,8.8704,1.3666,0.5426,4.1549,0.6857,0.6451,4.5618,0.0002,4.7066,1.892,2.9401,4.948,4.2629,5.3277,1.4744,3.3356,1.034,1.7603,2.9441,1.7024,3.9667,0.6275,0.172,3.2143,6.299,2.4027,1.8013,1.0533,0.8966,0.812,1.395,2.9653,2.6296,3.2013,0.7428,4.3353,2.9841,2.8975,0.7061,4.1902,0.0,3.4704,0.0124,4.1837,4.2513,0.7748,0.9121,3.1242,4.0224,0.0854,1.8591,0.6251,0.5814,1.4435,0.0002,5.7618,4.6637,0.4193,0.0001,2.3274,3.4529,3.4055,9.5713,2.7565,3.2931,3.7596,2.7523,0.4843,10.921,5.7008,4.1857,4.9079,0.2556,5.4868,2.7689,7.6109,1.1572,6.1643,0.606,0.0038,0.4608,5.5551,2.0438,2.8666,1.5136,1.3568,5.6417,4.7924,4.1874,4.6763,5.551,3.5217,1.8528,2.4513,1.5645,5.2681,3.0148,0.2008,5.1116,4.715,0.5601,4.9449,5.663,0.7352,0.172,5.1562,2.1003,3.5092,5.0377,0.0701,1.7281,1.0137,3.4423,2.7473,4.7193,0.0621,4.2244,1.4934,0.6908,2.6277,2.5507,0.802,0.7793,0.0002,3.856,0.6076,0.0963,3.1676,2.6724,0.0018,0.0004,3.8447,0.1585,5.9485,4.0702,0.0001,1.5334,2.4238,2.7296,1.0152,6.5155,1.7266,5.1587,1.7441,4.6823,4.9567,2.8008,5.1945,0.0034,0.0014,0.387,2.0495,0.5018,2.0445,0.2327,4.1071,0.8702,5.8354,0.7266,1.6195,2.5622,2.6676,3.2341,1.9229,0.6118,0.8093,0.0002,3.3274,3.7536,7.4877,1.6314,2.0989,1.2402,2.0019,0.503,5.9544,6.5878,1.6834,1.4689,1.5649,0.0312,0.0002,5.6838,2.637,0.0003,1.7481,5.6663,2.7271,1.0178,1.0885,1.5128,0.61,5.1016,1.7724,0.0372,2.7037,0.8111,3.1783,3.3372,0.5952,0.9332,4.7704,2.7765,3.8725,0.2112,0.9326,5.8515,6.8223,0.3379,5.2887,0.0062,7.644,5.2353,1.3929,1.9609,0.966,1.0734,1.6275,0.0172,1.0932,4.1767,2.1371,1.4448,0.0002,2.7126,1.0823,2.9517,5.105,0.8361,0.0009,2.2142,4.5445,0.4706,1.4574,1.0793,3.197,1.032,1.9514,5.6597,1.5805,0.7461,0.4579,1.1134,5.9105,2.4276,0.0078,1.6604,0.0001,6.3315,2.8893,5.5916,2.9723,10.6656,8.1578,0.7559,3.4921,3.7706,0.3861,3.1317,1.2838,0.0072,5.7957,0.606,0.0003,3.4339,1.3607,3.004,5.7128,1.5634,2.2168,0.8743,0.8984,2.421,1.8485,2.3616,3.3728,4.8947,0.0116,1.4861,1.946,4.6053,0.029,6.9346,0.192,0.1648,0.5765,2.3667,1.7343,0.0181,0.9621,2.9289,0.9617,0.6991,2.5343,2.4416,3.3087,1.287,2.2859,0.0254,1.7767,0.4654,0.0074,0.0004,4.1524,0.1037,5.0685,2.0796,5.0455,3.69,0.9996,0.2731,1.3688,0.2571,0.2311,1.7109,3.9809,0.9324,1.9869,0.0195,2.0413,0.0032,5.9773,2.7883,5.7934,1.69,5.2852,0.0037,2.6903,5.3916,2.0745,2.8702,1.3706,3.2094,3.2202,5.677,0.7521,2.8375,1.0147,3.6546,3.3471,0.2024,0.0382,0.875,0.3429,0.0003,3.8284,0.5016,2.8993,0.2601,4.5944,0.2994,0.1325,2.3473,0.0263,5.1666,2.2008,1.0513,5.3938,0.9119,2.669,2.6379,2.5855,2.1713,0.0297,0.0002,1.5206,0.6625,5.0214,0.0079,0.6506,5.719,0.8063,0.5367,5.4873,0.0082,0.0002,1.1422,1.3105,0.0033,1.8984,0.866,5.7492,1.14,3.5221,0.0653,0.0023,2.3818,3.0022,1.4846,2.5402,3.8333,0.5641,4.128,3.442,0.598,1.8204,4.2041,1.4939,2.0893,1.1379,0.4434,0.946,0.0003,1.3546,5.5795,4.6042,0.5106,1.4519,5.2376,6.4684,2.6967,5.6778,0.1468,3.2573,6.0351,0.9188,2.0243,2.4256,2.2622,0.9682,3.5408,1.8028,3.3091,1.3015,0.7111,1.6196,0.0003,3.7653,0.3001,0.2253,2.2567,1.9205,0.4197,3.9357,2.7116,2.9391,1.8419,2.8763,1.1182,5.8821,3.0079,2.0624,4.4454,2.5012,0.6309,1.3783,1.2947,1.105,1.077,0.0003,1.4491,3.573,2.5385,4.9276,0.4218,0.7422,2.8297,2.4913,4.6478,2.6119,2.0777,1.8438,0.8288,0.7227,5.8047,0.5798,3.1825,0.327,3.3705,4.0825,2.6988,2.6596,2.288,1.2402,0.4979,1.0984,1.5889,1.0632,4.1488,3.6477,2.1881,1.0402,4.2379,1.0793,0.3491,1.8699,3.8145,4.9469,7.0788,0.0427,0.2689,0.6586,3.3751,2.0461,1.6861,0.0159,1.0596,6.3957,0.4366,0.201,4.1144,3.2041,1.8828,3.2976,2.3629,2.7427,0.3461,4.4144,0.1329,3.3698,2.6119,0.6449,1.809,4.8654,5.3001,4.2505,4.2754,5.0668,5.1974,2.2518,0.005,0.4211,2.8486,1.6315,0.672,0.6372,0.0003,2.872,4.0392,3.4367,1.5362,1.2519,0.2051,1.4388,5.3807,0.222,0.7512,0.0001,3.0208,2.8085,2.6529,1.5095,0.2185,2.6766,1.0353,2.2218,3.3476,0.2155,2.0143,0.9748,4.3253,1.2772,1.5282,0.4242,3.2902,0.0001,4.8355,0.3192,0.1544,1.6275,2.798,5.1653,1.2813,4.1841,0.0043,1.8913,1.9128,3.0537,1.3481,0.086,4.0312]}
{"id":1611,"ended":true,"length":562,"gen_text":"Labor was always in short supply. The most common solution was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in return for food, shelter and a monthly wage of sixpence. The children worked for ten hours a day, seven days a week, although those in the colonies occasionally worked in the field.\n\nThis wasn't slavery but it was a forced servitude. Children of parents who couldn't live on the wages or didn't pay the child-policing fees were considered poor and sent to work camps.\n\nToday's labor unions have changed this. Rather than use forced laborers who were often the children of destitute parents or were sent to work camps as children, union leaders use the term \"employing children or adolescents\" or \"emancipation movements\" to describe the movement to liberate school children living in poverty.\n\nThe movement to liberate school children who live in poverty is a new development. One of its founders, Margaret Sanger, created modern birth control. Sanger called herself an advocate of the reproductive rights of female adults. Her greatest desire in this effort was to give women control over their fertility.\n\nSanger began her work supporting birth control by providing contraceptives to free women. These free women were the daughters of free black men. Sanger also provided contraceptives to poor white people. In doing so she became famous as one of the founders of the American Birth Control League. She also helped birth control activists in other countries.\n\nMost of Sanger's work as an American birth control advocate ended with her imprisonment for violating U.S. anti-impersonation laws. During her prison term she wrote, \"Now I feel that it is not for me to tell women in this country how they are to use contraceptives; they will decide for themselves.\"\n\nThis decision gave birth control to the American people. Today hundreds of millions of American women rely on birth control for personal health and economic reasons.\n\nHowever, the American people and the women and men of this country should be aware that many of these birth control methods contain chemical abortion chemicals used to end unborn children. Some use hormones and steroids. One of these hormones is estrogen, the hormone used to end pregnant women.\n\nThe birth control hormone estrogen is also prescribed by doctors to end a mother's pregnancy. There is absolutely no medical justification for using birth control devices, vaccines or radiation to end unborn children. They are used as abortion chemicals to end unborn children.\n\nSanger took this view of abortion. Many doctors who teach today believe this. They believe that they can use birth control pills to control women's menstrual cycles and that these pills provide more birth control without the use of hormones and steroids. However, this view is false. Birth control pills can only block pregnancy.\n\nBirth control pills do not end living babies.

{"id":3850,"ended":false,"length":532,"gen_text":"On November 15, near the end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai @ - @ shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to undertake strategic planning and strategic decisions that would lead to Chiang's downfall. During the meeting, he discussed in broad terms the most dire threats against the government and the possibility for armed resistance in several areas.\n\nThis document shows that on November 26th, Chiang was preparing for his fall after his defeat. He wrote to his father saying, \"At about 1030 this evening, I have gone to my rooms and am lying on my bed\u2026 As we are talking with each other, people who were with us are screaming; one man came out and ran out into the street, with a pistol in his hand. If any one of you says I did not tell the people to prepare for a showdown, you will have to show your documents, because I told them to use whatever means were necessary to win the day.\"\n\nOn November 26th, Chiang Kai-Shek's government tried to appease some of the resistance fighters. At midnight, police raided the Tainan Railway Station and began to round up and arrest some of the resistance fighters who were refusing to fight for Chiang Kai-Shek. Chiang Kai-Shek came out of the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council declaring, \"At midnight today, the military personnel will put their swords away and the police will enter the barracks. There is nothing more important than that.\" It was in this same address, that the Nationalist leaders declared war on the Japanese. Chiang Kai-Shek said, \"If the enemy attacks the Naxi [Shanghai] and Huaxi [Guangzhou] sections, we will fight back but if they attack my rear, we will not have the strength to combat.\"\n\nChiang Kai-Shek then took the final military action before his fall. He led an army of 1.4 million men. The army attacked the Japanese positions at Tainan, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, and began a massive defensive battle in the Shanghai area. The Japanese made several attempts to invade the southern coast of the Republic of China and tried to capture Yangjiang (China). The Battle of Shanghai, known as the Battle of the Dragon Head, lasted for three days. On November 28th, Chiang Kai-Shek entered a siege of the city after using over 12,000 troops.

{"id":3556,"ended":true,"length":537,"gen_text":"Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, roping and show jumping are practiced by equestrians on a competitive level\n\nThe First Army\n\nWith the rise of the Imperial Army in the year 1000 A.E., horses began playing a major role in battle. By that time, most horsemen were infantrymen. During the early Middle Ages, many soldiers used their horses on the battlefield, and many were so adept that they were actually chosen to lead the forces. The First Army was commanded by the powerful Duke of Burgundy. To this day, he is considered one of the greatest military commanders of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Battle of Crecy:\n\nThe Battle of Crecy, more precisely Battle of Franscen, is thought to be the biggest military victory by a European army during the Hundred Years' War. The battle was fought on August 19, 1346 at Crecy, France. It was fought so successfully during the Battle of Crecy that the British, French and Frenchmen agreed on a truce to protect the British and French troops. After this truce, the soldiers quickly made their way to the English positions. After a violent clash ensued, one of the Duke's officers, William \"Black Jack\" Irwin rode to the British position and fought his way across the field. On the British side, Hugh O'Connor led the British forces and had a clear view of Irwin. They could see the battle line, and thought that the Duke had been badly injured and might surrender at any time. Upon hearing this, the Duke charged at O'Connor and forced him to withdraw. He then charged at O'Connor again and took him by surprise at the foot of the hill. Then the Duke rode up behind O'Connor's horse and killed the horse. He then rode up to the English position and fought with the British until the Duke was killed. The British lost 15,000 casualties, and only 300 Englishmen died, out of an Army of over 11,000 men. The Duke of Burgundy was captured alive.\n\nThe Horsemen of Flanders:\n\nThe famous horsemen of Flanders during the Hundred Years War were a formidable fighting force. The Battle of Flanders lasted from July 4, 1454 to July 22, 1455. The fighting on the battlefield had begun on July 2 when Prince Louis of Nassau, Duke of Brabant decided to land with his army. His target was the army headed by Philip of Flanders, who was leading his army commanded by Prince Edward of England. When the two armies met, more than 8,000 men died. The only time a major engagement ever took place in Flanders was when the British and Dutch joined forces to drive out the invaders during the First Battle of K\u00f6ln, 15th of August 1541.","token_len":607,"entropy":[0.7434,0.2645,10.235,2.3687,1.7202,11.9544,0.0673,0.2438,0.4909,3.0419,8.3145,1.9524,4.2233,0.9794,7.2935,0.0054,0.3839,2.1913,5.7963,5.8123,1.3861,3.6185,1.3219,7.1625,0.0127,1.6073,9.9353,1.0727,0.0234,2.734,1.9554,3.9703,2.6361,4.6389,0.1517,4.9016,4.3811,2.6025,0.7638,0.0013,2.4223,0.0005,0.4201,5.3353,0.0981,1.6928,3.9477,0.0324,3.9167,3.8714,2.2675,1.1038,0.0268,0.1525,4.6921,0.5444,4.2954,1.3113,8.0341,0.0054,2.2247,5.7651,5.2715,1.7238,0.0002,4.7216,0.4729,3.5394,0.053,0.6192,4.7504,0.9996,1.5914,0.5867,4.1504,4.3427,2.7463,0.0032,3.853,0.338,3.8749,2.1184,3.9295,0.3869,2.6917,0.1582,0.1495,2.6787,0.2262,4.0632,2.8453,0.1161,0.1096,3.7954,3.1116,0.5489,1.0683,3.9475,0.4102,1.6654,4.93,0.346,2.7331,3.8168,0.0092,0.1033,3.2065,2.8364,3.3527,2.3897,0.6598,5.1785,1.4674,0.2626,1.6694,2.0798,2.6902,2.8581,4.3538,3.4428,2.231,0.3906,1.3632,5.9866,5.3387,0.8266,1.7252,1.1489,4.5699,0.619,2.208,3.257,0.1654,1.1441,4.6711,0.0477,1.4704,4.8441,1.9432,0.5697,0.7054,0.0001,1.6946,5.7557,3.4823,0.3728,0.0512,2.9269,0.3033,1.3068,1.437,0.0052,0.0619,0.4681,1.5067,0.784,0.8557,1.7069,0.4356,0.0018,0.1651,0.7062,0.0002,0.9751,2.8003,0.0419,3.8028,0.0122,4.8803,2.4786,0.0002,1.1709,1.1089,0.0105,0.0078,0.0003,2.3477,6.0303,6.2707,6.1984,0.0254,5.6668,3.4038,1.5111,1.9894,1.0305,2.1165,5.42,0.1128,0.7043,0.4187,4.8977,2.6926,1.9191,3.1846,1.8049,2.6804,0.5499,2.8688,0.0866,4.1541,0.0059,1.4264,0.0107,0.3211,1.2078,1.3085,1.2961,0.3274,1.5283,2.2814,4.0707,0.2401,1.2264,0.783,2.5965,1.1392,0.001,0.7629,0.6921,0.4164,2.4787,0.656,2.2297,7.0379,2.4843,6.3748,0.2102,2.071,0.0817,0.3719,0.0002,0.2136,1.3739,3.8392,3.4391,1.1124,0.7369,4.6171,5.1059,3.5019,2.8508,0.6482,1.7517,2.1479,5.0644,0.9814,3.5848,2.0507,0.7162,2.5445,1.551,3.5406,3.1113,1.5615,0.336,0.3763,4.7487,5.8817,3.99,0.4236,0.1668,0.8244,0.588,1.7956,4.6685,1.0465,3.2001,1.3239,5.7987,3.2987,5.2974,0.3011,5.3312,1.0127,0.0438,5.2808,0.4367,3.5424,1.1146,3.604,4.8575,2.9213,1.1939,0.017,4.8211,5.721,3.1132,0.2801,2.9628,2.7459,1.0921,4.4441,2.0111,0.0644,3.958,0.1541,0.9916,1.2266,4.4893,1.0473,1.7166,0.0682,0.2342,5.0873,3.3521,0.8909,2.6163,3.7502,1.1462,2.5693,1.9981,2.0221,4.7185,1.94,4.4749,2.5055,0.1017,1.7105,1.2693,5.1549,4.1909,0.7147,1.7608,3.578,5.407,2.4496,1.3934,5.4808,0.9217,1.1634,0.7454,2.5164,2.0111,4.3308,1.8519,2.0111,3.9331,2.9905,4.0972,0.1569,1.6055,0.0392,5.903,1.6101,0.8821,0.3871,1.4897,0.6885,3.8833,1.5259,1.051,0.0089,0.0205,1.3274,5.6727,0.2175,0.2999,3.5684,0.3666,3.3956,0.6275,1.7149,0.8092,0.8528,0.0029,0.012,0.335,0.7967,5.0048,0.575,2.3159,0.1622,6.4536,0.5359,3.8842,0.0181,0.3979,0.567,0.3558,4.9179,1.8382,0.1777,3.1252,1.6395,3.1822,0.7609,0.0051,0.0121,3.5221,0.2503,0.613,2.5631,2.2384,0.5686,0.8903,2.2547,0.2747,1.598,1.0373,1.1179,1.2072,1.971,1.5917,0.5457,2.9035,3.2621,1.4642,2.1686,2.8791,1.4835,1.7381,1.1424,1.2609,0.4891,1.666,2.2306,3.0384,5.2248,0.1086,0.041,3.2008,1.6686,1.3847,4.1035,4.5115,2.63,1.0394,3.9228,3.3075,3.5819,0.0122,3.1115,4.915,0.0654,2.319,4.652,0.0373,0.0553,1.2507,0.1026,1.7033,1.0018,0.7062,0.0101,0.0004,0.8594,3.4814,1.8829,1.3651,0.6405,0.0002,1.0672,4.6522,1.888,0.9311,3.4595,0.0027,0.8032,0.0374,0.0002,0.9277,4.1915,2.8098,0.0873,0.1539,0.3483,0.0067,3.8637,0.0834,0.2186,0.0053,0.7824,0.4802,3.5272,4.868,2.334,0.0336,0.3086,1.4493,4.7244,0.0089,3.339,0.1104,3.9629,0.7287,0.9355,5.3479,1.2612,0.5204,3.6656,0.3608,0.9736,3.383,0.0109,0.0129,0.8828,0.2528,1.0345,2.9324,4.9815,0.8061,0.874,4.7832,3.1253,1.1835,0.6065,1.705,2.4038,4.056,1.3554,0.5564,3.1262,0.0,1.4742,1.1694,0.0105,2.2245,0.001,0.0031,6.6529,0.0914,5.986,4.391,1.0399,0.7621,2.0256,2.7042,5.2064,0.1612,0.3888,5.563,7.6414,0.2242,3.2786,1.569,3.0135,0.0002,0.7637,3.0364,0.7216,1.8289,2.0363,0.9603,7.5032,0.0054,3.1728,4.0914,0.3753,1.0437,0.2213,4.4672,0.762,2.1103,0.1875,0.3739,0.6521,6.7444,0.0887,4.2815,0.0494,0.0591,1.0297,1.8183,1.4362,1.1311,5.4898,5.7566,2.4991,3.338,3.8102,4.509,0.7146,0.003,1.0625,0.705,0.0079,0.3651,3.2699,0.8886,3.8444,1.0605,3.8133,5.7337,0.1298,1.2635,4.4011,1.4942,0.1429,3.9679,2.6187,0.0873,3.9672,0.7036,0.0056,4.5835,3.5442,0.1193,2.8355,3.4404,5.0817,2.3434,1.9553,1.4467,3.6788,0.0593]}
{"id":2238,"ended":false,"length":545,"gen_text":"Sense and Sensibility was released on a two @ - @ disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008. All three episodes were given away free with a copy of the Daily Mail newspaper on its launch day in the UK in January 2006. The show featured Peter Hitchens' discussion of religion with Dr Neil Cavuto, and Christopher Hitchens'debate with Richard Dawkins. All three episodes of the show were also available on the BBC iTunes and BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe book is the book.\n\nIt is a satire about religion and morality.\n\nThe book was adapted into a TV movie for BBC2 entitled The Censor's Hammer. (For more details see below).\n\nIt is also on Wikipedia for those who are into that sort of thing. A Google search on 'The Censor's Hammer' results in a large number of articles and discussion forums. You can even browse some of the articles on my own Wikipedia article, but beware of what you read!\n\nI wrote it, so there's that.\n\nWhat is it about?\n\n\"The book is about the relationship between good and evil, compassion and cruelty, right and wrong, and the meaning of life. I hope to show you how it does not matter that our perceptions of morality might change, because the evidence shows that the best way to live, which is the way in which people feel best about themselves is the way to live.\n\n\"I don't think that religions provide the answer to life's big questions, but they certainly hold out a certain illusion of certainty that is hard to break. It is easy to fall into a world-view and convince yourself of something you didn't before, because you have made a choice to believe it.\n\n\"This book is not for the easily shocked, but my hope is that it will at least awaken a few people to the need to think for themselves, to question authority, to take responsibility for their actions, and to believe in a better world.\n\n\"In the end it is the individual who decides when it is time to act, not any god or group of gods, so I hope you will share my delight in asking yourself whether you really want the big bang.\n\n\"What about that? I am not a believer in a god, but what about the concept of a Big Bang?\"\n\nThe book is available in bookstores in the U.K, on the BBC's iPlayer website.\n\nPlease help me to promote this book through YouTube, Facebook, and other networking, by sharing this webpage with your friends, and sharing the video itself.\n\nIf you are interested in making your own films about good and evil, please visit my Youtube channel at How does the world work?\n\n\"The God Delusion\" is available via the British Book Service on DVD and download in the U.K.\n\nFor ordering information, see http:\/\/www.britishbookservices.com\/buy","token_len":607,"entropy":[3.6295,5.869,2.8553,4.7932,3.0175,2.1539,5.0731,6.1374,17.0653,7.3816,9.3173,7.9026,6.2397,2.7327,2.1031,1.8781,2.6125,4.6079,3.8131,3.1733,0.6869,5.9634,2.6774,3.6733,0.8163,5.171,1.7018,1.813,1.6254,1.9482,2.2746,0.0116,0.658,10.5253,1.0424,1.6313,1.6773,3.6545,1.7482,0.1917,3.2705,0.7433,0.1071,3.1843,2.1045,3.506,0.2177,1.5631,3.1417,4.5163,6.0829,5.9943,0.0252,4.8951,4.7097,0.464,2.5667,1.4912,5.0297,5.1734,3.4346,0.3527,1.1719,2.5675,5.3674,0.0024,0.0022,11.4726,9.8513,1.2882,1.2453,2.7409,0.0051,0.6272,4.6051,0.2185,0.3586,3.2604,0.7551,0.9375,0.4534,2.8007,2.0954,1.0668,1.189,1.1446,6.753,2.7743,1.8085,0.1062,0.0292,1.2542,1.039,0.0112,1.7314,5.3781,2.5556,3.3082,5.7347,3.5905,2.0122,0.0001,3.8314,1.0582,1.858,5.5866,3.0104,1.1515,1.5685,4.3826,1.0094,0.9076,0.0001,1.9027,1.4229,2.3829,4.6289,0.7466,0.3742,2.756,2.3382,3.5965,1.301,1.3232,4.4443,1.3557,3.9348,2.1244,0.3443,1.9881,1.3973,5.2715,5.5152,1.4605,1.7769,1.3208,3.2359,1.4012,0.288,0.0002,2.5876,1.1788,1.9545,4.737,4.3987,5.1771,3.0473,0.627,2.3242,4.4616,0.8519,0.2631,0.007,0.0127,0.1457,6.4091,5.3544,0.3718,2.3089,2.1603,1.3967,0.3389,0.022,0.0106,0.0088,0.1011,4.7061,0.0138,2.0512,4.0027,0.595,0.0049,2.0299,2.3523,4.0492,2.2142,0.7623,4.9201,0.4405,2.5585,5.598,3.9492,0.3043,0.627,2.0112,1.665,4.6135,1.0571,2.5689,2.0786,2.7859,2.6517,2.4313,1.1672,5.1591,0.2656,0.4451,2.3466,0.658,0.0002,3.1953,3.3027,2.7043,3.3797,2.5511,3.4122,1.2399,2.3352,0.283,0.3953,0.0001,4.4167,1.6786,1.2199,0.9433,0.1126,0.1103,0.0002,4.0029,1.5077,3.9253,0.3132,1.8654,1.5977,4.4079,0.1109,5.3217,0.2749,0.0539,0.9113,5.899,0.074,1.0359,0.2238,4.255,0.0156,0.001,0.4324,1.5943,1.1208,4.4341,0.1552,0.5004,0.9889,3.0515,3.2929,2.6612,1.9833,3.2936,1.6905,3.2988,5.6672,0.8304,1.2751,3.6599,4.3672,5.801,0.5404,2.5866,3.944,2.3915,1.7533,2.3757,1.8207,4.9835,2.1272,0.3286,2.1521,4.4069,1.5743,0.1809,2.2794,4.2912,6.195,0.5403,1.9159,2.0913,2.7629,0.0046,4.6212,5.562,3.6716,1.3883,0.1659,5.5571,2.3265,0.7198,2.6235,0.5333,1.1352,2.429,0.0002,1.7374,1.8444,3.8793,0.0008,1.9799,1.5793,5.5179,5.0419,2.0885,1.6541,0.5259,2.038,0.1987,1.6538,0.0816,1.1004,0.6637,1.7891,2.6848,5.509,1.0462,2.2668,4.7961,3.7488,0.72,1.1082,2.1378,2.2959,3.5948,0.1314,2.9017,0.5919,3.2021,0.6368,3.9492,0.2066,4.2285,0.7161,1.8789,4.0034,4.3953,0.0688,3.3048,5.1442,0.805,2.4732,3.2996,1.9614,4.2469,0.0003,4.1652,0.9711,3.3944,1.7656,1.618,4.3868,1.8269,2.1363,1.0707,0.6363,0.9211,0.5405,1.779,0.0002,0.0552,3.7519,1.0442,0.5567,1.8945,4.0732,1.5063,2.2496,3.4238,1.3574,1.2619,5.9547,0.7915,0.0454,0.2048,0.5556,0.3655,4.366,0.0422,4.2474,1.7629,0.2348,0.9734,0.2419,0.3344,3.911,0.7041,1.5021,0.9038,0.0373,1.2885,1.3526,1.0809,2.8768,0.4625,1.1357,4.0515,0.7419,0.0843,0.4423,1.4704,0.5843,0.3099,0.2168,5.2894,0.7435,2.6846,1.7793,0.7691,1.9974,1.0196,0.0002,0.1314,3.5966,1.3527,0.7234,3.2774,0.8352,2.0515,1.7116,0.648,1.533,5.2607,2.4639,0.1394,0.4398,0.111,4.2384,0.912,1.512,3.6361,2.2917,0.9355,3.2541,0.5787,0.0655,2.0611,2.6382,1.6903,1.1771,1.8513,0.4993,4.8108,0.9293,5.0203,0.8459,5.8624,1.257,2.8374,0.8868,1.5253,1.2619,4.989,5.7424,3.2377,3.2191,1.0321,0.0002,0.1534,4.7319,3.9622,4.568,4.3521,3.8104,3.3877,1.5391,1.58,2.5865,2.2523,1.6597,1.5691,1.1527,0.7484,4.4354,1.1546,1.8645,4.8414,0.0823,1.0005,3.2686,0.0134,1.6288,0.1943,0.0002,2.0372,1.396,1.3659,2.0249,1.0068,4.4112,1.3124,2.3802,0.2787,3.8889,0.0011,0.7975,3.3669,4.866,2.5362,1.2406,3.6557,0.8791,0.0205,2.5795,2.1592,0.7219,0.0002,5.6451,3.5378,1.4624,2.4429,2.8384,1.2978,0.5532,4.2798,6.1881,1.3343,0.8517,0.3603,3.0873,1.8915,6.0103,5.0189,1.9982,1.5567,0.858,5.8679,1.6128,0.6266,0.091,1.4197,1.3052,4.3488,1.3758,2.4254,4.8029,1.647,0.7594,0.0002,2.9066,0.1202,2.0746,1.5636,0.0809,4.2544,4.2286,0.1235,6.0596,1.212,6.9647,0.4743,0.023,0.356,2.2031,2.5642,1.3228,3.3905,0.802,3.2329,6.8698,4.4655,2.1641,1.9471,0.4248,0.4915,1.0498,0.0002,3.8796,1.6145,5.7102,0.1128,0.0008,0.4649,1.18,1.4421,5.1976,2.2575,5.3882,1.561,3.8158,2.8728,3.48,1.2459,2.5911,2.6697,0.2289,0.9697,0.0012,0.0823,0.2619,1.6599,0.0002,3.9315,4.6986,0.3737,0.9216,2.5787,3.2679,0.0015,0.1719,0.004,0.4915,0.0562,0.008,0.9453,1.9739,0.0023,0.2178,0.1435,4.9402]}
{"id":2370,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led some people to speculate that Sirhan stood to Kennedy's left (facing west) while Kennedy turned east. In any event, Kennedy's gun was loaded.\n\nAn empty magazine was found at Kennedy's feet, but bullets from the rifle remained where Sirhan was supposed to have stood after firing and thus the weapon must have been empty, and thus Sirhan's killing of Kennedy was not spontaneous. A round fired from the gun's muzzle traveled past Sirhan's face so that it hit the wall of the pantry; a fragment came out of Kennedy's right ear.\n\nSirhan's gun had been found beside Kennedy's body by investigators. As a result, the authorities were compelled to conduct tests to determine what kind of gun it was. In a gun-trace laboratory, a bullet and the powder from the cartridges it fired were analyzed by a specialist known as the ballistician who works alongside criminal investigators during the murder investigation.\n\nThe police lab determined that the gun had fired seven cartridges. This indicated that Sirhan had fired the gun from close range, perhaps 2-to-3 feet (0.65-to-1.14 meters) from Kennedy, which was the range in which the fatal shots were fired.\n\nAfter Kennedy died, Sirhan was arrested by police at 8:10 p.m. the same evening. The two men had been living at the house that had been rented out that day. The authorities were able to get into the house through the unlocked garage. During the first search of the house, a cartridge casing was found in a garbage bag stored in a cabinet. On the trunk of his rental car, Sirhan had a shotgun wrapped in plastic that he had recently borrowed.\n\nThe next day police arrested George L. Stambaugh, the owner of the house where Kennedy was killed. The two men were taken to the Santa Anita Police Department where they were put in solitary confinement during the first night of interrogation. They were later allowed to see one another until the next day when they were moved to separate rooms in the Los Angeles County sheriff's department jail.\n\nOn the evening of Wednesday, November 22, police found a bullet fragment in the pantry of the house that had belonged to Sirhan. Police tested the bullet fragment and it was confirmed to be a live round from Kennedy's gun.\n\nFrom the cartridge box and the gun, police found some rounds for the gun Sirhan used. They examined the bullet fragments. Tests were also conducted on that bullet fragment, and it was determined to be full of foreign material. The police then sent two experts to determine all of the gun's components (magazines, bullets and cartridges) were correct and that the gun was in perfect working order, thus establishing that Sirhan had not murdered the young civil rights activist.","token_len":607,"entropy":[8.573,0.6629,9.9721,0.4032,7.1022,5.7113,0.7812,3.3688,2.5749,1.4311,5.38,2.2632,0.176,1.4581,2.8997,5.0613,1.6894,1.3565,2.1978,8.8797,0.0068,7.5812,6.1298,3.9684,2.9046,4.9119,4.0867,0.1703,6.1939,0.0114,9.3553,0.4019,0.2853,4.6949,5.3315,1.0379,0.6237,3.0316,0.0668,2.3821,0.0498,0.5547,0.0005,4.549,3.0493,2.3217,0.0084,0.8557,3.6738,2.4815,0.8507,0.4225,2.8459,0.8328,2.2017,5.2084,1.1306,3.5827,2.3378,1.0554,0.0299,2.0737,0.9623,4.748,0.8826,3.7232,3.0405,0.9335,0.0022,5.5709,5.823,1.9108,0.9285,0.2632,2.3666,3.0685,0.0012,1.0552,1.1974,1.5523,5.6752,1.719,0.9262,3.7509,4.3472,4.662,1.7628,0.0005,3.2199,3.1255,0.0018,0.1243,2.1344,6.238,2.1043,5.8823,5.1671,2.8273,3.5481,2.4578,0.0683,0.2509,2.8721,3.4405,3.4148,2.1794,2.5544,0.0014,1.4966,4.1674,1.0892,0.4866,0.6472,1.2675,5.4108,0.3452,4.7005,5.2723,2.8921,0.4606,0.9837,1.8515,3.3088,1.585,4.4755,5.5804,0.7235,0.0009,0.7069,2.3304,5.3388,1.2583,1.5559,2.1433,1.6569,2.1384,2.6295,0.1863,0.0707,0.0004,4.6678,2.1791,4.2814,6.231,1.4627,0.6042,1.1063,0.0402,2.0931,1.7143,1.708,1.168,0.0002,2.9315,0.0012,0.9663,2.5749,1.9181,1.2745,2.8546,5.2651,1.315,0.2451,0.1377,4.0695,4.4117,1.3597,5.0556,2.3734,0.5665,0.5507,1.6675,4.7421,2.2364,4.6463,0.0234,4.0884,4.5593,1.3222,0.4411,3.0889,1.4782,0.0116,0.3086,0.4338,0.1102,0.3672,3.6926,2.798,5.1044,2.5326,4.5549,2.5797,0.6201,1.6925,1.6924,5.0034,2.0585,4.6178,2.153,0.7235,6.8783,1.8357,0.5381,2.8909,3.2429,2.5858,1.4478,3.7776,4.7576,0.0317,3.0844,2.0036,0.213,5.0803,4.2014,5.4222,6.2265,0.5333,6.186,1.6291,3.9244,0.1451,0.1203,1.1672,0.0002,0.8758,5.0989,3.5772,2.3136,0.0903,0.4558,1.4085,2.0561,2.0131,3.4473,3.2926,1.787,4.1717,4.1382,0.1335,1.3245,0.0004,0.9399,0.5417,0.9014,0.5573,2.2054,3.2532,0.1118,1.1403,3.008,5.8157,2.399,4.297,0.0216,0.4117,0.1971,2.6077,1.2977,0.0174,5.4374,0.2489,0.1302,0.0127,0.9104,0.377,4.7988,0.1997,0.7787,1.0261,0.2135,2.0022,3.7024,1.8097,2.6598,2.3204,3.6444,0.0181,1.9748,2.8034,2.4545,0.4374,0.0747,0.2515,1.2215,0.0002,4.7695,2.077,3.3867,0.0945,1.1763,0.0006,1.1841,1.3246,2.1303,1.1286,2.3698,5.168,0.1988,3.5867,0.4521,0.001,0.001,0.1701,4.8293,2.801,1.6339,0.5758,2.5686,4.9583,1.0571,1.6815,0.9433,3.7666,3.6773,0.7544,3.5104,3.779,3.5344,0.3172,1.4395,3.6804,5.1265,2.3282,0.927,2.3446,4.7334,2.2593,2.876,0.0077,3.6585,3.0448,0.3136,0.3837,3.2879,1.1444,3.2535,3.1846,1.4661,4.3522,0.5657,4.4383,2.3826,1.021,0.0452,0.6197,0.1897,2.8872,4.8101,2.4082,0.4078,0.2528,1.0337,1.2401,3.6629,2.3721,6.6645,0.7664,1.1994,3.5571,0.8393,4.5047,0.6585,5.3339,0.1863,4.3849,7.219,0.0225,0.2137,3.8059,0.0012,0.6688,2.1479,5.3484,4.5386,0.0756,2.2933,3.1269,1.5164,0.9136,5.2507,4.9613,1.3641,0.6965,0.0002,1.859,3.0029,0.4545,4.6677,3.7348,6.7102,5.3271,0.258,4.1123,2.2317,0.6843,0.3256,2.1207,2.0547,0.0283,0.1299,0.9407,2.3672,1.4471,1.2827,0.4977,0.5254,2.9913,3.3492,0.4301,0.8544,1.7753,0.2498,0.4703,4.3089,1.5312,2.0162,0.8819,1.7953,1.0116,0.4063,4.2707,0.7626,3.4345,0.0703,5.8757,0.6404,3.2403,2.2544,0.9193,4.1758,0.1641,2.7925,0.2368,2.9099,3.3504,0.1826,2.1394,2.5502,0.0344,6.3921,1.4913,1.3433,0.8328,1.998,0.5096,0.1515,2.9827,0.3564,1.3353,1.5701,2.1161,0.3606,4.5472,0.002,0.3284,4.4359,0.0212,1.8013,2.482,0.1797,0.4028,0.0002,2.2716,1.1316,2.3749,0.0324,4.9125,0.0527,1.1905,1.7046,0.0421,2.9888,3.9352,1.7544,3.5595,1.9378,0.8191,0.9072,0.9207,0.0025,1.2589,0.4737,1.2114,2.9204,1.5631,2.6725,0.0017,0.8053,0.0006,0.4401,3.8981,4.7384,0.3736,1.0637,2.2005,1.1736,3.627,1.5258,3.768,0.8792,0.4048,1.4547,4.5289,0.3838,1.6989,1.8968,0.0032,0.4505,0.1673,1.2622,0.0002,5.4182,0.9336,4.2531,5.9069,3.0729,0.8843,2.446,1.7224,0.8721,2.8321,5.214,5.6302,2.1754,1.3704,2.757,2.273,0.0016,3.0011,1.3269,1.7793,5.837,0.4851,3.7397,1.0923,3.9691,5.8122,2.065,2.7746,0.6811,0.344,6.927,1.362,1.5882,1.9575,1.3468,0.5033,0.5437,0.9921,0.8403,0.2401,6.3375,0.6097,4.8764,1.0119,0.7631,1.9511,2.518,2.7715,3.6212,4.7955,2.518,0.7508,4.4727,8.7172,1.5567,0.073,3.8977,0.186,1.05,5.1204,4.7368,0.6872,0.0963,1.3109,2.0106,2.1596,0.3691,2.7669,4.9628,1.7298,1.316,0.8374,0.7253,0.9784,2.323,3.3031,0.5127,0.1086,3.5151,4.177,3.6817,0.6342,1.2223,0.0008,0.7772,1.4051,5.977,3.8724,2.3856,3.569,0.0102,1.3574,0.2581]}

{"id":2699,"ended":false,"length":560,"gen_text":"Angered over his electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti @ - @ Harrison supporters, even challenging one to a duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his next trial.\n\nIn the year since those charges, Jennings has been sent to prison for murder. In November he was sentenced to death.\n\nRough-counters have tried to capitalize on the public's excitement over the trial.\n\nOn his personal Web site, Jennings said: \" The case before you concerns a woman named Nancy Gertrude Roper. She and her husband were victims in the unsolved murder of the man we lovingly knew as Jack Jennings.\"\n\nJennings added: \"This case involves a woman charged with murder who is a personal friend of the president of the United States. \"\n\nWhen asked what he did for a living while in the Federal Witness Protection Program, Jennings said he had an account with a credit union in the Atlanta suburbs and got some money from working with young, poor and hungry people.\n\nJennings, who said he made some money helping other witnesses stay in touch with police, said he received about $100,000 in Federal funds from the program.\n\nAnother person who claims to be Jennings' cousin, Paul Johnson, said on his Web site that he is the real-life person portrayed by the public on the ABC series \"The People Vs. Jack Jennings.\" At the time of his arrest Jennings was a lawyer for the Justice Department's Office of the White House Counsel. At the trial, he represented the Government.\n\nJohnson -- a stock market analyst -- said Jennings went by several aliases and he never knew when the real Jack Jennings changed his name, and claimed to the public that he was on trial.\n\n\"I don't believe I know my real father, nor am I very proud of the fact I am related to my father,\" Johnson said.\n\nHe said he had gotten the nickname \"King Jack\" from the media, \"But it is just a nickname and nobody knows anything about my real real dad, he is an extremely private person. He has been married for over twenty years and not had any children.\"\n\nJohnson said the real Jack Jennings did not talk much about his time in jail, \"But even as you can hear on the show, he spoke about a lot of things from several different perspectives. \"\n\nThe real Jack Jennings was on the show's final episode but was not in the courtroom during Jennings' first trial. Jennings was sentenced to death after being convicted of the murders in 1967 but was released after 15 years because he was deemed mentally incapable by his judge.\n\nJennings was also never called to testify at his trial. Instead, Jennings' sister testified during a two-day trial. She told the court that her brother was a good father to his children, and that he was \"kind and gentle-natured\" but that he did not \"play with his children much.\"","token_len":608,"entropy":[7.5786,3.7457,3.1347,8.7429,1.6072,0.572,11.6895,13.6417,0.9321,0.0497,7.1389,17.8431,10.8302,8.0279,9.134,10.8115,2.4579,6.0528,5.794,2.1856,0.6178,0.3536,0.42,0.5921,3.6829,1.7712,6.3036,4.2746,0.0706,2.509,1.434,3.4799,2.8952,8.0993,10.1826,2.7638,3.67,2.9603,4.7838,0.3162,1.3635,0.005,2.725,1.8514,5.0191,4.9981,5.9833,5.6945,1.2148,2.0989,0.7271,1.5362,5.5535,0.0985,0.6298,0.907,3.1837,1.5658,3.1679,4.4111,3.7685,0.6491,1.9711,0.0173,1.4771,1.1596,0.6154,0.0002,4.9695,4.1572,6.0315,6.9969,1.9053,3.6215,4.0632,0.4926,3.2131,0.0337,0.7595,3.5794,0.996,5.5991,0.6611,0.5137,1.4375,1.4052,1.7717,0.0002,2.82,3.188,4.464,1.9766,0.0556,0.0996,0.6802,4.0784,2.6594,0.1137,9.3045,4.6441,6.2141,1.1965,5.5214,1.4424,5.1894,2.4124,4.0405,5.1624,2.2868,0.2359,0.003,4.6977,3.1706,0.9536,1.2044,3.7547,0.5667,0.7546,2.354,5.341,3.3531,1.4132,5.704,0.7534,0.0674,3.2767,3.4468,4.3875,5.1536,0.0026,6.1995,0.0277,4.9519,2.8185,1.7362,0.1793,0.0002,1.7225,0.0006,3.4379,0.8361,0.0115,3.2432,1.6491,3.1965,1.4124,1.9711,6.764,0.0855,1.5243,1.7732,2.1334,2.7918,5.7783,0.2353,0.2055,1.9884,2.9186,1.1228,0.0899,0.0632,0.0028,0.8124,4.0562,0.3231,0.0002,5.2487,2.356,3.6899,1.2468,4.5275,1.9886,1.4187,0.0086,5.8142,1.4952,2.4007,5.0591,0.561,0.015,0.0365,0.2054,0.1417,0.9159,1.2914,2.3728,4.152,4.997,0.8157,1.4891,2.4244,0.3238,2.1894,3.2007,3.752,3.8035,1.8838,5.8251,4.052,1.1751,1.1357,5.0874,3.5842,4.245,6.1248,3.1444,3.6563,4.4105,0.9652,0.3876,0.4315,0.0002,2.1991,0.0003,2.3561,0.6806,2.6612,0.1996,5.7814,4.2953,0.8897,4.767,3.6549,2.3807,5.9956,1.2874,1.9255,0.3535,5.5531,0.516,0.639,0.3194,5.3221,3.0848,0.0547,2.9943,1.0771,0.0099,1.2848,5.4221,2.4476,3.2168,1.1192,0.447,0.6307,0.5806,0.0002,6.2873,4.1282,1.1502,4.0074,0.0725,0.7846,1.37,0.1868,2.1802,0.6649,4.9254,4.683,0.0891,1.0131,3.5167,0.7729,0.1192,0.0142,0.3201,1.0537,2.2544,2.1379,2.6226,3.712,0.0572,3.4628,2.1538,1.1778,1.7694,6.6277,3.4696,1.0121,5.9696,2.2682,0.696,1.7983,0.7311,3.1034,0.0175,0.189,0.233,0.1662,7.8795,1.2435,0.8536,0.5503,1.2619,0.8966,2.2943,0.6507,2.1552,4.4945,2.2214,0.7352,3.6155,0.0657,2.0047,2.5469,0.0089,2.4594,5.0076,0.0057,0.1898,0.2755,6.2724,0.569,2.5946,0.7299,1.0576,1.3183,1.0333,4.3846,0.8176,0.3253,0.0002,0.9752,7.0429,2.3819,6.0546,6.1484,1.0745,1.1645,0.5271,1.7611,5.1469,2.6238,3.1364,1.3899,2.1503,4.1356,3.3632,2.2719,5.4731,2.3092,0.5379,2.1882,0.5358,4.7002,0.182,0.3474,3.2633,3.5601,4.5273,0.554,5.0627,2.0577,0.6995,0.2431,0.5126,4.5683,3.3447,1.0852,0.342,0.0002,1.345,1.5753,2.7283,0.0009,2.4012,2.9216,3.2178,4.0281,2.2473,1.5657,2.2138,3.2752,3.3863,0.006,5.7568,1.8407,0.18,1.8955,1.7159,2.4748,2.0931,0.555,0.0238,4.2865,1.4296,0.6436,0.3724,0.4557,0.4628,0.7503,0.0002,2.5255,0.5723,0.8404,2.5499,5.7272,2.7563,3.4595,0.5865,5.6013,3.0056,0.09,1.0517,2.6372,2.761,2.0343,3.5232,4.7291,2.5925,1.8793,3.9111,0.6744,0.7779,2.6105,5.3873,2.1938,3.3595,0.1889,1.5639,0.3758,4.9026,2.5684,2.5255,4.0861,1.1777,3.5616,3.764,1.7456,0.6903,1.8291,1.7036,2.2357,2.1973,3.7002,1.4028,2.0495,5.0946,0.2866,0.8726,6.4251,1.8079,0.5903,0.4771,1.0454,0.1114,0.0002,1.5412,0.5494,3.2816,1.1013,0.7739,0.1218,4.0656,0.2498,4.5086,1.5035,0.6437,0.3731,4.568,0.3567,4.9323,1.1685,2.5714,2.6828,6.1403,4.7719,5.0399,1.117,3.0209,1.6369,0.6183,2.0676,0.484,0.7459,4.623,1.3457,3.6544,0.7195,0.0525,0.8686,4.5866,7.1644,0.998,1.169,1.0881,3.0027,0.2093,0.0002,2.8458,1.5411,1.1379,0.0267,2.3557,5.2129,0.9682,1.6236,4.6086,3.9447,0.2002,4.9977,1.9939,0.9141,3.0036,0.9383,0.2511,2.4446,1.4534,0.0973,3.5183,0.268,0.4842,2.634,1.3728,1.9885,0.0794,0.2436,2.531,2.6067,0.3699,0.3512,1.4503,2.8081,2.4243,5.2326,4.8365,1.8366,1.7942,1.7442,5.1935,0.1299,1.9829,2.5218,0.9654,2.3509,0.3406,3.5445,4.3005,3.6491,5.3915,0.2832,0.515,0.0002,2.1172,0.0002,1.2754,3.7506,5.7934,3.8186,0.5274,0.1075,1.2613,0.6167,2.5704,0.9037,4.6421,0.2412,2.9262,0.3817,4.4622,1.8136,3.8388,2.9851,4.748,0.0458,0.5608,0.8294,1.6063,2.3941,2.4831,0.7681,1.6661,0.4628,1.004,0.1764,1.1689,1.4216,2.3921,2.1194,1.9153,1.3648,1.7872,1.3741,1.7283,1.1175,0.6455,1.2439,3.1748,4.1909,1.061,1.2007,4.602,1.3019,0.0,2.2009,2.6734,2.5519,0.3411,3.3852,0.406,3.8574,4.3777,2.2433,1.7606,0.8211,3.41,0.3368]}
{"id":2072,"ended":false,"length":558,"gen_text":"Walpole was a keen and discerning collector of art. Sir Kenneth Clark called him `` one of the three or four real patrons of art in this country, and of that small body of men who really do pay for art to live in.'' ( The Art Market, 1934-1947, p. 51 ). Kenneth Clark knew Kenneth Bounds, and that's him at right: Clark, Kenneth Bounds, and Robert Hooper Clark. Kenneth Bounds was the great nephew and namesake of the infamous artist Robert Hooper. Kenneth Clark, Robert Hooper, and J.B. Bounds became the new owners of the famous gallery, and with the added financial support of Clark and Hooper, the gallery moved on to a new location in New York, with Hooper's wife, Elsie Munt, now at the helm. J.C. Johnson, another prominent New York artist living at the time was also an early patron of the new gallery. The Johnson Gallery and the Pasternak Gallery both moved to new locations in the following years, and after a second move to a different location in Manhattan, the Pasternak Gallery was closed in 1943.\nThis is a portrait of Kenneth Bounds (1931)--a member of the American Academy of Arts (AAAS) from 1935-1939, and one of the founders of the Arts & Sciences (AS) Society. He had moved to New York City to further his art career in the late 1930s: he is the artist on left. The painting above (above) is titled, \ufffd The Little Girl Who is Still Small -- The Painting of Robert Hooper (1936-1939). \ufffd\u00a0 It is very similar in form to the photograph above and was the sole work of Robert Hooper ever to be sold for a profit. This is my own copy, which was in the collection of the artist I am discussing here. It is my feeling that Kenneth Bounds was not a great painter, so much so as a talented collector--a collector of images whose work is frequently copied, and with whom one was very familiar. This is certainly the case with him: Hooper copied over twenty, or more likely twenty six, of his paintings, the only three of which were signed and dated by Kenneth Bounds. In any event, you can see what a good artist Hooper is. Robert has some great style and composition. However, Hooper can be just a little bit off in his choice of light and dark. The light side of his figures tends toward the soft side and the dark, almost black, side appears to be the opposite of what Hooper intended. I must emphasize that the work is not as bad as it may look--but more a case of Hooper showing off instead of truly being a good artist.

{"id":3508,"ended":false,"length":534,"gen_text":"Santos became active in the Puerto Rican Independence Movement and identified himself with the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and its president Pedro Albizu Campos after he was discharged from the military because of the prejudice he faced as a Cuban-American.\n\nHe worked closely with other Puerto Rican nationalists including Jose Feliciano Sanchez, who also fought in the Mexican War, and Roberto Roldan, a former member of the Basque National Liberation Army who later began training Puerto Rican nationalist forces after coming to the United States.\n\nHe also sought to fight racism and prejudice he faced at the Puerto Rican Independence Movement. He organized marches to protest the persecution of Puerto Ricans in the Philippines and the United States.\n\nHe also helped organize a mass movement against racism, but it was not until the 1960s that his work to build a more just society was appreciated, particularly by Black and Puerto Rican community leaders.\n\nHe remained active in the movement after his death, especially in the antiwar and liberation movements, working with other Puerto Rican nationalists in the United States and the Black Liberation Army. He published some of the key works of popular Puerto Rican culture, including Taps and the Autobiography of a Revolutionary and The Puerto Rican Nationalist by Pedro Albizu Campos and His Times (1966.) He also wrote a memoir of his own titled The Island's Story: The Story of the Puerto Rican Revolution.\n\nThe island is named for him after his death.\n\n\"Ramon Santo is the founding father of modern Puerto Rico,\" said Pedro Albizu Campos. \"He is viewed primarily as a patriot but also as an intellectual thinker and a revolutionary-he is remembered as a fearless intellectual who fought for justice and equality, and as a fighter for the right of self-determination, as well as a man with an unswerving commitment to his people in the face of relentless hostility from the Puerto Rican elite.\"\n\nAlbizu Campos said Santo's memory was part of the reason the organization chose to honor the former leader at this year's Puerto Rican Independence Day march.\n\n\"We honored him because he was one of the principal architects of Puerto Rican nationalism,\" he said. \"He understood the value of the struggle of the island population, and he saw Puerto Rico as an indispensable part of the nation, not as a separate entity but as a part of the United States.\"\n\nAlbizu Campos said that Santo's death should not be seen as an end to the struggle for Puerto Rican independence.\n\n\"No one knows exactly who, if anyone, will take his place,\" he said. \"But we can say that the struggle for Puerto Rican national self-determination will never be complete until Puerto Ricans everywhere can freely decide to separate from the United States.\"\n\nContact Tracey Kaplan at 408-278-3482.

{"id":3929,"ended":true,"length":568,"gen_text":"Bomar fully recovered from his injury and played professional football as an end for the inaugural 1925 New York Giants of the National Football League ( NFL ) with Jim Thorpe, Century Milstead, and Bob Feller. He participated in five major league contests (all of which he started), and in 1926, he was chosen to captain the Giants to a second-place finish in the National League Championship, and later became an executive for the team. He was also elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nIn 1932, he helped form the National Legion of Honor and was named honorary president in 1932. In 1936, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. There are a number of anecdotes about Mr. Bomar's military career:\n\nHe was one of the first Americans to serve in the Navy. His military appointment was as captain in 1934 while a player for the Buffalo Bills. It was the duty of the captains to give orders during the game, and the captain must give permission for any flag to be displayed. At one date, he asked a captain, \"Who said the flag should stay down?\" This prompted a comment from a fellow captain: \"Don't give me no orders on that one, Jim.\" Bomar responded quickly and told that captain to get someone else to give him the order to give the orders.\n\nThe first football game in the U.S. was played in Brooklyn, New York, on December 20, 1890, and Bomar is believed to have participated in the game at one point in time.\n\nIn the game that year, New York defeated Fort Wayne, Indiana 7-6. Prior to the game, Bomar gave out a marching band uniform to himself and gave the marching band uniform to his good friend and fellow American football player, Joe Buglewicz, a man known as \"Bomar's Horse\" for his speed on the field,\n\nOn another occasion in 1899, Bomar was playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates in a game at the Giants' home field where the team was playing with the New York Giants, and Bomar's team was hosting the Giants in the exhibition match at their own field. A storm at night forced the teams away from home field and gave the game away to the Giants. The game was played as scheduled, with the Pirates winning 8-0. When Bomar returned home after the game, he had a nightmare about his dream being real, but in the morning, he returned to the field with the Pirates in first place. As a result of the dream, he kept the dream until the game, despite the fact that he was sleeping on his couch.\n\nBomar was appointed Captain of the Army of the Potomac at Fort Myer, Virginia, in 1910. He participated in a number of military engagements during World War I, and became a captain after the final battle for the war (World War I was a \"total war\" fought with the use of aerial bombardment).","token_len":609,"entropy":[7.6588,4.6916,11.46,2.9762,1.2553,0.7529,1.6855,1.1782,2.4181,8.8312,1.341,4.7007,2.5547,6.8857,2.2365,0.7604,7.9719,10.3068,4.2497,0.1869,1.2466,5.2261,0.0149,1.769,0.1509,0.0133,2.3628,7.8679,2.481,4.4743,6.976,0.4668,0.0011,1.1909,13.3648,10.22,7.4434,0.688,1.1169,4.0986,3.713,0.4721,0.2948,1.6179,6.3391,0.0739,3.9387,5.3248,1.1667,4.419,3.5001,2.7282,3.4084,0.5829,1.214,0.6483,1.4526,2.062,2.9062,3.4034,1.6456,0.9543,1.0311,3.8772,0.6931,3.3509,0.1424,1.1412,3.3293,1.0951,3.7916,1.6939,0.1331,0.1185,0.2678,0.0857,1.5348,0.3084,3.0061,3.6195,2.7744,4.0817,2.5232,2.8384,3.6982,1.6247,0.0821,1.5678,0.4222,1.9729,1.6038,2.013,2.3416,0.2719,0.0722,1.4204,0.0683,0.014,0.0041,0.0009,0.1568,3.8858,0.3677,0.5508,0.0077,2.2998,3.5069,0.056,1.4463,4.3107,3.2448,0.2282,2.6304,5.5258,0.1723,1.3861,2.206,1.7221,2.8536,2.4571,1.2042,1.791,3.1743,0.4816,1.4895,2.3974,0.0807,0.2454,0.9046,2.472,0.0003,0.105,0.0202,2.3392,0.0658,0.0288,1.0105,6.9005,2.2943,3.3738,0.4943,0.0039,5.1171,1.2442,6.0033,0.0014,0.2402,0.0009,1.1542,5.087,1.8752,3.7489,0.7383,0.0002,2.1472,0.8959,3.7398,0.0054,0.6964,1.1511,3.8253,0.2314,2.0324,0.3528,0.59,4.1274,1.7588,3.9332,4.0896,6.0031,0.6714,1.5862,3.4747,1.8656,6.4707,6.0653,2.8839,4.6021,0.7808,0.0728,4.2137,0.7026,0.6033,4.9414,0.3025,3.1029,6.4286,0.068,0.9438,2.7275,0.4866,4.4261,2.4463,4.0428,1.7256,1.6378,1.4271,0.8542,3.2264,0.9996,5.2851,2.63,4.492,0.6529,1.9435,4.2009,0.6981,0.0949,3.059,0.8749,4.3272,1.9647,8.2158,0.4524,2.5673,3.4709,2.2584,2.6082,3.598,0.6152,3.4348,5.9105,2.4623,0.2902,2.319,5.5187,1.8706,0.4012,4.5417,3.7367,1.3822,4.3471,0.4232,1.6752,3.14,0.7332,2.6345,0.0492,3.819,0.0161,4.2154,2.2594,2.7322,1.749,4.6296,0.3512,2.1995,0.8469,2.9853,1.2081,1.6492,0.0007,2.3279,7.1303,2.703,3.5844,4.6533,0.4074,1.3141,2.7843,5.9118,0.9002,0.3846,0.6955,0.7149,1.6947,0.9543,4.1445,4.2111,0.2774,4.0068,0.2561,1.4425,0.0002,3.4946,2.8906,3.8305,0.5297,2.4821,1.7148,3.2471,0.0022,0.0292,0.0251,0.7807,0.3351,0.9843,4.0245,0.5949,0.5335,0.0013,0.6288,0.6929,2.6947,3.5252,0.0325,4.5599,1.2328,1.7925,2.2409,0.0009,5.2513,1.9047,0.0146,0.1372,4.372,0.3515,1.3651,0.7477,4.9143,2.7445,0.9503,3.1852,1.4775,0.2241,1.0004,0.0002,1.7639,2.2896,5.3217,2.3541,3.6689,0.2507,4.5605,0.0233,1.201,7.0519,1.795,0.6093,0.4001,4.6732,0.2011,1.5585,0.7305,6.6669,0.003,0.2634,0.1616,0.0634,1.0002,0.0004,4.1884,4.327,1.1946,5.3442,1.0587,4.1224,0.399,7.5233,0.8934,3.5806,1.6547,3.8236,0.0559,1.853,0.1045,1.7878,5.6066,0.0409,2.2139,1.3277,3.6983,1.8697,0.2351,0.6065,3.5613,4.4601,2.4431,0.0907,0.0003,1.4125,3.2691,5.0733,3.8792,0.9849,0.7742,2.6198,0.3765,0.9765,0.906,5.9171,1.4644,1.5462,0.1777,2.9677,1.6047,0.1778,0.5928,3.5574,5.5117,0.0002,3.1991,3.9879,0.1046,3.016,4.908,0.1004,0.9093,0.0004,1.4985,2.4105,0.9766,0.2681,4.1264,1.3865,2.0171,0.9732,0.4981,2.9578,1.6701,5.6743,1.108,1.6827,0.9066,6.3415,1.1099,3.3572,0.8493,1.6045,5.4004,1.7546,3.2833,0.0312,0.993,2.1728,1.353,3.0734,0.0005,3.0647,1.362,1.1442,6.1188,0.3135,1.7984,2.684,1.0644,6.1886,3.2019,3.2394,3.9512,2.5754,3.4014,0.3527,4.2028,5.0815,4.8763,3.3794,2.0015,0.3435,2.8273,5.211,0.1925,1.4486,0.9442,1.4177,5.9626,1.1672,1.9738,1.5347,0.8645,0.1789,0.8655,0.4805,1.7729,2.2884,0.6846,1.6911,3.5327,2.3169,1.2668,1.8046,0.5992,1.4164,1.2842,2.8427,0.0445,1.1111,0.4144,4.2626,2.7357,0.0005,2.2349,0.9936,2.7419,0.083,0.0608,0.133,0.3271,3.6848,1.5772,5.0762,1.3565,3.0726,2.3221,1.9191,4.5635,1.7021,3.0295,3.2872,0.4282,0.5675,0.8625,0.2837,5.8254,0.1454,0.6715,1.1625,2.8535,1.3974,1.9989,2.9247,3.8273,0.0206,0.9622,5.3353,1.9515,0.5932,0.7701,0.888,1.8023,0.127,0.9533,5.0451,1.0357,2.4008,4.2332,1.3393,2.811,2.7828,4.7575,0.7775,0.3443,0.1265,0.8987,1.1298,5.5438,1.785,2.204,2.028,1.0112,0.6764,0.0002,1.7907,0.0005,0.0001,1.1795,5.2518,4.9553,0.3636,0.0674,3.4421,3.4168,0.23,0.2649,0.0002,0.0018,2.9284,1.0818,1.955,0.001,0.7154,0.1601,0.4836,0.669,3.9403,0.6302,1.0234,4.6753,0.0397,3.0483,0.7707,0.0034,2.1922,1.9927,1.6231,0.6685,0.0115,0.0383,0.7506,1.6531,4.4166,0.7802,3.1202,3.8085,0.4445,6.941,0.8871,4.6528,0.9181,3.4159,4.375,2.8283,0.0034,1.1466,2.1706,2.1517,4.3173,0.9661,0.022,0.6662,3.6331,3.2734,2.9388,1.3587,0.0041,4.8803,1.3628,1.8039]}
{"id":2235,"ended":true,"length":561,"gen_text":"Davies commented that he would have liked to have been in charge of the casting. He revealed that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast in the role of the eldest Dashwood, because he felt that she would be too young.[4] During filming, he told his daughter she was too young for the role of the eldest Dashwood, and that in the script she was played by a much older actress.[4][27] He was also displeased with his own performance when the film was screened for the cast and crew; he had initially insisted on having a dialogue-free scene with his daughter that was cut after being suggested by director David Yates; he believed the scene would have been better with a character reacting to his daughter's comments.[4][27]\n\nTrivia\n\nIn real life, Davies had no children with his wife, actress Joanne Froggatt. His second marriage to Eileen Riley lasted 18 years. He lived in the Bay City district and is buried in St. John's, Jamaica.[1]\n\nDavies had been involved with some of the other members of the Lost cast during shooting, while in London for the filming of Season 4. When he arrived back in the UK, Davies suggested the notion of a reunion (in an interview with Empire magazine) where they might all meet each other, however, he was not invited to the reunion by the crew, who had already had their own planned gathering in the months leading up to the filming. [28] Davies and his Lost co-stars also attended a filming of the series in Los Angeles after the series finale of Season 4. [29]\n\nHis co-star Rose Leslie wrote an unpublished novel called The End of the World by a Man of Letters on the theme of the end of the world, which is illustrated by a selection of Davies' paintings.[30]\n\nIn a 2011 interview with the Telegraph, Davies gave an explanation on how his relationship with Lost led to him having a difficult relationship with the network during production. He explained that when he was hired to replace co-creator Carlton Cuse, Cuse was offered an increased salary for a season, which was rejected until Davies pointed out that if Cuse made less than they gave him, they might have to lay him off.[31] Cuse subsequently asked for the money back, however, Davies explained he only received the first year's salary at the time.[32] In the same interview, Davies admitted he didn't really want to work on Lost, but he was persuaded to do so by Cuse, so that the show could continue for another season. [33]\n\nDavies co-invented the phrase \"The End of the World is nigh\".

{"id":1182,"ended":false,"length":541,"gen_text":"There were 112 deaths associated with the construction of the dam. The first was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for the dam. His body was recovered in January and his remains laid to rest in front of the monument to his memory in Koonjunga.\n\nAn engineer in the Royal Engineers who made the risky but highly strategic decision to build the dam lost his right eye and half his left forearm when the concrete dam he was supervising on the Ganges was blown over by a cyclone on August 15, 1922.\n\nIn the year just before the disaster two other Royal Engineers who were assisting the work died; one from typhoid fever and the other from the plague. At least the deaths of these engineers may have been accidental. Nonetheless, the deaths still shook the community and created the impression that the dam was unsafe.\n\nOn September 12, 1922, during the floods, the bridge between Ganga-Yamuna, which connected the dam sites, collapsed under its own weight, resulting in the death of 14 people.\n\nOn October 24, 1922, the head of the civil supplies mission for the State Electricity Board, D. S. Lai, died when the ceiling of his office on the banks of the Yamuna collapsed. When the ceiling caved in he was thrown headlong into the river.\n\nThe flood disaster of 1922 caused considerable hardship to the community. This is especially true because several thousands of families had spent the two days preceding the cyclone building dams. As the authorities knew that the dams would be badly damaged by the cyclone, they decided to use the time to repair these dams and, by so doing, would not have to continue construction after their completion in the next few months.\n\nThe people of Kishangarh village in Patna, a few kilometres downstream from the dam site, are still suffering from the damages caused by the disaster. People from the region were allowed to return only after a year and a half. An estimated 60,000 people were affected by the flood. Most of them did not want to go back because of the inconvenience.\n\nThe Kishangarh floods did substantial damage to the dam's foundations. The work of repairing the dam, which had taken nearly 8 years, had just begun and had only started in the year 1923. This proved to be fortunate, because the Yamuna River's flow had returned to its previous level by the end of 1927. As a result, the dam, which had to be constructed to cope with the increasing water supply, was completed before September 1927.\n\nThe Yamuna Development Corporation was established and a Board of Control to oversee the dam was set up. It included two members each from all three dam-builders. In January 1923 the first structural works were started on the dam.\n\nThe Kishangarh Flood of 1923\n\nJ.K.

{"id":2320,"ended":false,"length":561,"gen_text":"Sify's reviewer rated the film as `` Excellent `` and stated, `` It is not often that you sit in a theatre with bated breath, never wanting to miss a moment of your'favourite film. This is true to say the best film of the year, I am so glad I waited for it. It should never be missed. '''\n\nThe reviewer also said that `` The film is an entertaining and unique story that is told right without flinching and without fear of any movie ever being finished, and that what he wanted most were the characters that got to stay, and the movie was entertaining as well. The film will always be remembered as a one of a kind, and I am so impressed with it that I am sad that it would be such a shame to miss it for one more time. I know what a loss it is to the industry, and in fact the entire movie industry when it is lost, but it would really be great to see a new director give it a shot, and to see someone work so hard to capture the spirit of this film. ''\n\nThis film also received good reviews from the New York Times, the BBC and other publications.\n\nIn 2008 David E. Kelley won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Editing. He won the Oscar for Best Original Special Visual Effects. Kelley received a Writers Guild Award (WGA) Award for best motion picture editing.\n\n`` He is an immensely talented editor, and an accomplished and very committed teacher. He is always at the forefront in shaping film, and that's as clear in the past three releases as it is in this one. His work on `` The Blind Side II \ufffd\ufffd (2009), `` The Departed (2006) and `` The Matrix Revolutions (2003) sets him apart as one of the most prolific editors working today. ``\n\nFilm Critic Roger Ebert stated that: `` It may not be perfect -- yet. But `` Lincoln \ufffd\ufffdis one of the boldest, funniest, most compelling, exciting and rewarding movies I've ever seen, and I expect it will be for a long time to come.

{"id":3903,"ended":true,"length":548,"gen_text":"When Goldsmith took over as editor, there was some concern at Ziff @ - @ Davis that she might not be able to handle the job. A consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was brought in to help in the search. The first story on the site was about how to use Google's new autocomplete feature. On Nov 15, the Times-Picayune published a story about the latest Google auto-complete algorithm.\nWith Goldsmith at the helm, Ziff @ - @ Davis became increasingly skeptical that she would lead what he wanted to be a national digital journalism brand. The Times-Picayune published the first article by Goldsmith on Nov 19 with the headline \" Google Auto-Complete Goes Global.\" As for the initial stories, the Times-Picayune ran them on Nov 24, Nov 26, and Nov 28.\nWhile trying to sell a story to the Times-Picayune, Goldsmith told its editors she wanted them to write about the Google Auto-Complete feature. As part of the deal, however, Goldsmith agreed to publish at least ten stories during the first three days. By the Sunday, the site reached a total of 26. In addition, Ziff @ - @ Davis agreed to pay Goldsmith a total of $ 4,500 (now $ 4,750 ) to serve as the paper's technology columnist.\nWhat's the big deal now? Google announced today that it will put an end to automatically entering search results for web pages, something that has long been the business of its search engine. When people search for the phrase \"\" Google Autocomplete \" on the web, it will come up with a web page that shows when the user typed it using the auto-complete feature. The term is expected to continue to appear in search results for \" Google Autocomplete \" even when the autocompletions are turned off. I am glad that my friend is keeping the search feature.\nGoogle will also make the feature easier for non-programmers to use. In its announcement, Google said that people who can program can make it possible for people to start typing search phrases into the search box and have Google Autocomplete suggest articles on the web that match.\nOf course, Google did not mention its other search engine, Google News. Google has a monopoly on news searches. Google News is a new engine that is currently only available in the US. On June 2, 2012, a blogger showed that Google News is likely to be more lucrative than Google Autosuggest.\u00a0\nIf you are going to start an Internet company, you would probably prefer to not be in competition with Google. I would have preferred that if Google had found that there was really a market for more than one search engine for each major market, that the two would compete with all of these other competitors. (It also might have been nice if Google had done its homework on \" Google Autocomplete, \" rather than relying on a newspaper to discover a new new feature).","token_len":609,"entropy":[10.4933,1.8971,4.1472,0.9398,1.6184,4.9286,1.6772,4.2391,0.6179,4.1167,2.6217,3.987,8.6398,2.3062,14.9001,9.1503,9.3011,9.6671,1.2109,3.698,1.6006,1.4721,0.7346,1.4718,0.0081,2.2552,0.494,2.3351,1.0157,4.6606,7.2856,2.7425,7.6221,10.2095,6.6976,9.0943,0.2862,2.0765,0.5058,0.1424,0.465,1.2401,4.9225,0.9831,2.9914,1.5887,3.2734,3.2701,4.8008,3.8031,1.1894,2.1482,0.7613,2.4405,3.7241,1.7493,3.5802,2.8685,2.2424,2.225,4.5643,0.078,0.0153,0.7381,1.3085,4.9847,4.7366,6.9309,0.3092,2.7554,4.2023,4.2685,0.3384,0.0048,0.0004,1.5845,0.855,0.9166,0.8988,1.4473,5.7331,4.3033,6.0662,0.0786,0.1738,3.7079,1.5929,1.8337,12.0314,4.5464,0.0025,1.6224,0.0166,0.0341,0.1097,1.6718,0.0058,0.1282,0.1142,0.0054,0.0454,2.4029,6.608,6.3011,3.3205,3.4688,1.7123,6.0825,6.4453,5.4397,6.1095,0.6701,0.4684,0.3993,3.1535,3.4946,3.7835,3.6643,0.1919,2.9293,2.4271,0.0216,0.001,0.0033,0.0002,3.5183,3.6228,0.961,2.8834,3.1249,2.5829,0.0022,1.1869,2.0833,2.6222,4.703,0.607,0.2026,0.6544,5.8927,4.4844,0.1787,0.6711,5.5603,4.2612,1.2562,5.3385,4.7557,0.7609,6.1694,4.3971,0.8781,1.9231,1.0442,0.0247,0.001,0.0049,0.0004,3.511,3.6394,0.9901,0.5686,4.047,0.9607,1.5262,1.3805,0.4205,0.8362,0.3334,0.9643,0.2799,0.881,4.7123,6.6332,0.0247,3.9419,3.4699,1.8686,1.2393,1.0177,0.2017,0.0353,0.0012,0.0038,0.0001,0.5345,0.5806,0.0018,3.5155,6.4753,2.7507,3.3364,2.3624,2.3346,0.0222,3.1084,1.216,1.687,2.8325,2.2842,0.022,0.2585,0.9046,1.3257,4.1107,3.2054,0.0018,0.6731,1.2433,0.1167,5.0152,0.0028,2.2449,0.0008,2.8211,0.5599,3.2821,3.4442,0.0275,5.3739,1.2409,5.3779,0.5789,1.2177,2.0654,3.2577,2.0946,4.2182,1.0529,6.6663,2.2322,1.8884,3.8565,7.0614,2.347,1.0484,0.0537,4.8052,2.9592,3.5982,1.9758,0.9088,2.4965,0.0033,0.0956,0.0085,0.0023,0.0094,1.8067,0.0898,1.4966,1.1741,0.0014,1.7995,2.4876,0.0196,0.0603,10.1551,0.2079,1.6608,4.4522,5.9965,0.4746,3.2018,0.0247,2.5901,1.3427,1.7379,5.2038,0.1455,1.7471,2.8509,0.0046,4.7239,1.741,0.429,0.614,5.0965,3.2331,2.0111,2.7952,0.0895,5.4489,0.1299,3.6248,4.409,2.4357,0.1706,0.4802,1.2767,5.8375,2.609,0.1862,0.0068,6.486,3.7063,1.7489,2.9374,1.3311,3.6669,1.7554,2.6104,5.1472,1.0486,1.4562,3.2534,0.2938,2.5145,5.0833,2.4686,2.812,1.7317,0.4341,0.5724,5.1185,3.3794,2.1646,0.4888,3.1306,2.2301,8.3404,3.8055,4.1663,0.1043,0.0029,1.606,1.8441,1.3253,1.3786,0.1408,2.8404,0.853,5.1909,0.0743,0.179,1.6275,6.6023,0.0569,1.3109,3.9789,6.173,1.5643,1.7174,2.3049,1.7789,6.9711,0.7951,4.5493,0.0278,0.0543,0.4905,0.6216,2.0605,4.6884,1.8753,4.1251,0.0082,4.8376,0.2916,2.0003,0.7637,1.8775,0.1548,1.1858,3.6552,2.1132,0.2727,0.0493,0.0026,0.604,3.8107,3.377,1.0188,2.6844,0.0131,7.6395,0.0187,1.717,0.8306,0.0128,0.3168,6.5704,3.6562,4.3182,1.196,5.4207,4.7126,4.3469,5.9013,1.4981,3.4266,2.1112,2.8438,2.4023,2.9984,3.1163,1.7924,3.2315,2.3076,2.3881,4.064,1.8208,5.3586,0.0167,4.8,0.0224,0.4112,0.5651,0.5654,2.8759,3.5071,0.757,0.4628,0.3848,1.1831,0.8672,3.3399,1.6081,4.3547,5.1959,2.2886,4.2847,2.2162,3.1669,0.5989,1.9261,0.682,5.5386,0.7413,3.6105,2.5912,2.8413,0.7214,1.728,0.3437,0.8061,1.9662,1.6589,2.4338,0.0392,0.0056,2.591,4.9129,3.5117,0.9976,0.4481,1.4662,0.5862,3.0688,1.3177,4.7175,0.024,0.0732,2.1482,4.6207,0.1464,2.2235,5.3661,2.631,2.9021,0.9995,0.4819,2.2994,1.3907,0.781,2.5906,2.9109,2.9672,3.1607,0.3073,1.4191,3.7079,1.8689,3.0342,0.6955,1.1823,1.6321,4.8324,6.1451,0.5763,1.9268,4.3531,1.966,0.2291,0.7399,0.5889,1.0853,0.6177,5.2978,4.7208,3.4372,0.0806,3.4082,0.1411,3.9934,4.519,5.9372,1.0281,1.0638,0.3701,2.3677,5.4134,0.474,0.9967,2.8154,5.7201,0.5655,0.3206,0.3837,4.3553,0.2381,0.6393,4.3104,0.58,3.9355,0.6354,1.7529,4.6986,0.0159,3.515,3.3038,3.1515,3.0015,0.319,1.148,3.2718,2.9505,3.4039,0.5764,4.1739,1.6524,2.3766,2.4971,0.0233,0.2511,0.8246,3.2395,2.9151,2.707,1.2748,1.3003,5.3539,0.891,2.4727,5.6994,3.4808,3.5396,0.3108,6.1234,0.7023,1.9942,0.257,5.6809,1.4908,1.1036,1.0919,0.0778,3.8047,5.7267,3.668,1.6662,0.3627,1.2214,2.7964,2.2013,1.5656,1.275,2.0848,7.718,1.7899,4.4865,1.4934,3.8866,0.6961,5.5264,3.8842,3.8283,2.5982,0.28,0.5548,1.908,0.4824,0.6148,0.6851,4.055,3.357,1.2594,1.6566,5.9503,1.4433,0.3407,0.5793,0.0068,6.9286,0.4654,4.1901,0.0075,3.2261,0.1346,1.6301,4.2829,2.1725,4.74,3.8632,1.8391,6.7232,1.2757,2.9471]}

{"id":670,"ended":true,"length":504,"gen_text":"The tawny nurse shark may be one of the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, crustaceans ( e.g. crabs and lobsters ) and mollusks ( e.g. clams and crabs ).\n\nThe adult female nurse shark is about 10mm in length and approximately 2.5-3cm in diameter.\n\nFeeding\n\nOxygen is the most important requirement for nurse sharks. During daylight hours, the predator spends most of its time on the high seas feeding at night on small crustaceans, e.g. eel, crabs, sea urchins and other scavenging prey.\n\nA nurse shark will take on various objects and items found on the seabed such as discarded sardine cans or fish bones.\n\nNurse sharks are rarely seen in a marine aquarium and prefer living in large schools.\n\nIt can also be spotted during the day, often feeding upon sea urchins and other small prey such as eels and crabs.\n\nBreeding\n\nGrowth rate is slow with female sharks producing 2 or 3 litters of 2-5 pups. Breeding takes place in April to August when pups are 2-3cm long.\n\nBehaviour and CompatibilityTop \u2191\n\nAdult nurse sharks are aggressive to most species of fish, and will chase them when cornered. This is why we rarely see the shark in a group with similar sized predators.\n\nThey are generally peaceful in the aquarium but due to their high rate of reproduction and schooling behaviour, they will aggressively avoid each other and will only eat if threatened.\n\nSexual Dimorphism\n\nBoth sexes have a prominent dorsal fin but the penis on males is rounded. Females are also brightly coloured, with the body a deep orangeish colour, a dorsal fin that is relatively sharp and pointed with the caudal peduncle being a darker brown to black colour.\n\nReproduction over a period of several months\n\nMost nurse shark births can only be observed once the female's egg is attached to the bottom using spermatozoa; at this point she will spend a lot of time trying to produce more of the eggs and will have a very poor brood.\n\nThis species, like common nurse sharks, usually live in schools with a single dominant animal (males or females).\n\nThe gestation period for a female nurse shark is 20 to 24 weeks and gestation is influenced by temperature.\n\nWhen the female nurse shark is healthy enough, she will deposit her eggs in a small bag of water to incubate. The eggs then stay in her body cavity for 16 weeks after they are laid.\n\nWhen the shark is ready to begin feeding again the young shark will detach from its egg sac and swim away from the female. It will remain in the water at least for one to two weeks before going back to the nest to nurse.","token_len":610,"entropy":[8.4115,6.0202,0.0106,9.2573,5.5001,5.1868,1.0772,2.5222,0.0298,0.0994,3.1005,6.1919,11.6019,0.0323,6.1769,0.7982,0.1149,6.1167,0.9167,1.1985,5.6836,4.9777,6.3921,1.3548,0.7946,5.8275,0.0491,0.3627,2.6358,1.045,0.0,0.0421,0.205,4.0104,0.0266,0.0082,3.4455,8.5949,0.6001,0.0179,0.4695,2.3473,1.754,0.7603,0.0004,2.9838,0.1649,2.5898,0.0044,0.0038,0.1576,0.5578,0.5568,0.0014,0.0007,0.0223,2.2489,0.0001,1.1477,2.9034,0.3648,1.3579,0.1604,2.0228,5.2136,2.4977,0.7026,0.0511,1.4673,1.9999,3.3498,5.2488,0.8717,0.1526,0.9094,5.3398,2.4524,1.3528,0.2795,3.4188,0.2175,1.0208,0.2946,1.4114,0.3971,2.61,0.0002,4.0946,0.0101,1.5824,0.0002,5.9645,2.0332,0.0466,2.0959,1.9312,2.0479,0.2323,4.2892,0.4165,1.5556,0.1682,1.0576,4.4475,3.5835,0.4955,0.6022,1.4652,6.5471,4.3877,0.7035,0.0104,0.0997,0.1629,3.2737,0.1517,5.6282,2.3697,2.886,3.6556,1.8608,1.2516,2.2722,2.3525,0.0033,0.0388,1.1479,3.4619,0.0614,0.0012,0.0377,5.2535,1.893,1.4802,1.4348,0.7142,2.7954,0.0821,0.0,0.0201,0.9332,2.465,4.4428,1.2567,2.9547,0.2764,0.8875,0.0003,4.0617,0.8687,0.0052,1.8075,3.42,3.2634,5.23,4.4222,2.4032,4.7369,5.1341,1.1031,0.1227,2.7584,0.0146,0.0012,3.1066,0.0047,4.4952,4.6627,0.2878,0.8817,0.218,3.0791,3.8466,2.1256,0.4733,1.3459,0.0002,3.4974,0.1332,0.2516,1.256,5.5831,0.513,2.1436,4.4394,5.1198,0.9467,2.1387,3.9966,4.8314,0.7253,4.9225,0.7147,1.3961,1.0253,0.0002,4.1169,4.2418,2.2853,0.1923,6.2865,4.3615,0.8432,0.5927,3.5517,3.4464,2.254,4.9241,3.3134,0.3474,0.0,0.0334,1.4827,1.0784,1.77,2.5929,2.6384,0.0039,4.016,0.5157,1.5334,0.7453,0.3301,0.2942,0.0002,3.3655,0.0101,0.1971,0.0002,5.826,3.7098,2.0865,1.2623,2.2028,3.5302,3.9068,2.0839,3.301,4.4089,3.1971,0.1701,2.4309,0.0319,1.8101,2.4906,0.3748,1.8442,0.5958,0.0005,3.0513,5.6068,0.0185,2.222,0.0798,0.9719,4.4032,2.2076,2.7911,2.8292,4.5333,0.0005,0.4794,3.7368,0.4811,0.5099,0.7769,0.6958,0.6075,0.4314,0.0002,3.801,0.1332,0.6855,0.5199,0.0042,0.0018,0.0007,0.0002,5.0815,0.1328,0.0244,0.4029,3.4267,1.9661,2.6471,2.8071,0.4741,0.3002,1.7378,2.519,1.8975,3.7103,1.1843,4.3942,2.692,0.0562,0.1984,3.6677,1.6267,4.6773,5.8154,4.355,0.3011,3.7071,1.8114,0.4887,1.0664,1.6284,1.8896,4.9985,1.2133,3.4962,0.6436,0.3623,0.0002,2.1592,0.7177,3.0564,0.6118,3.0577,1.0831,0.6862,2.2125,5.4909,0.0074,0.1619,3.9461,2.4356,0.0031,0.4068,1.6669,5.2307,0.5321,0.7622,0.9257,2.6566,5.1066,4.8564,1.9485,0.0042,2.7838,1.7187,3.1039,4.5489,2.5396,2.8215,0.1464,0.2887,0.0002,2.548,0.0114,0.0,0.0018,0.0082,0.0002,3.8337,0.8442,1.5771,1.6495,3.902,1.2442,0.2443,3.5059,1.2286,7.6419,5.0902,2.8489,0.1069,6.0075,2.4432,1.1229,1.2029,3.4062,5.1541,0.0809,1.978,1.3007,2.3958,3.6467,3.614,2.6173,3.3456,5.4022,2.6731,2.248,3.721,3.4268,0.1632,1.7063,0.578,5.2908,5.0175,0.4159,4.5026,3.3907,3.3629,3.5768,0.0006,0.0028,0.4551,0.0011,1.2308,2.7036,1.7889,1.8746,4.0934,0.2666,0.9442,0.4811,0.3811,0.0002,0.4813,0.0001,0.0071,10.7034,0.9606,0.9611,0.0159,1.5387,0.7047,3.2735,0.0002,5.4289,1.072,1.2121,3.0052,4.7064,4.4371,0.4697,0.9078,3.8071,1.7713,1.534,4.8633,1.7605,1.9561,6.4092,0.3919,0.4274,3.9288,5.006,4.5364,2.016,0.002,0.096,5.9474,4.7904,0.4662,0.701,2.3352,0.8714,5.4164,2.1801,4.0708,0.0111,0.1021,4.5239,0.0377,5.4003,0.9968,3.4233,1.1099,1.6222,2.5565,2.2243,4.4323,1.7818,2.1974,3.3654,4.6295,2.9447,0.4067,0.0002,2.89,2.872,4.4611,1.0443,7.8161,0.0528,0.0445,0.2989,4.9278,4.6787,1.4642,1.3379,2.9088,1.9994,1.9216,1.8728,5.3102,3.3189,5.5302,0.19,2.3148,0.0967,1.2525,1.0554,0.0002,2.2621,3.0963,0.0232,1.5633,2.275,2.8402,0.4951,0.0046,0.3557,5.6155,2.2513,2.2352,1.5407,1.5246,3.6162,1.9336,5.5662,0.0435,1.3273,1.2163,1.059,0.0002,3.7137,1.0535,1.0949,0.5956,0.0692,0.3614,5.2166,2.9528,1.4795,0.2113,0.1866,4.3682,1.3268,0.1681,1.0524,0.9148,2.764,5.5476,2.9031,2.4873,4.2744,1.4819,0.0037,1.2462,2.0312,0.7276,4.4904,4.2329,0.6359,4.6788,0.6921,2.4946,0.886,5.7858,2.1603,5.1215,2.542,0.2426,0.4296,0.4342,0.3209,0.0002,3.0031,0.3777,4.5183,0.3684,1.5188,0.1647,5.0836,1.4337,2.7621,2.7877,2.7952,2.1049,0.4097,4.2014,1.1699,2.1448,3.0908,2.174,0.3562,0.7338,1.3025,1.2882,0.3797,3.5752,0.6573,3.058,0.7726,2.7337,1.3497,0.4712,1.7904,4.1631,2.0108,2.0315,3.0062,2.8454,0.1535,0.5255,0.8985,4.2255,1.3223,0.3669,0.6212,1.8712,2.1071,1.2593,0.4915]}

Triceratops fossils are generally only found at levels between 6-14 meters lower than other Triceratops fossils. A variety of other dinosaur remains are found in the Mongolian sediments with Triceratops being the most common fossilized dinosaurs found.\n\nPossibly more Triceratops remains are found in Mongolia than any other land creatures (including other dinosaurs), but Triceratops fossils are probably most abundant in the Lower, Middle and Upper Cretaceous layer of western North America.

Dinosaurian bones, like those which most people see in museums, show only skeletal remains. In fact, dinosaurian fossils show very little skeletal bone at all. That's because triceratops had a highly developed neck muscles. They could hold the head up, and hold the head up even longer than this to support a much larger body! Triceratops also had large, thick,, and relatively soft bones in the vertebral column, so their skull structure was also relatively light and flexible.

Finally, the size of their stomachs was similar to that of modern mammals. Triceratops also had an incredibly thick, thick and massive skull, but it had very little bone in it. Their skull was also very short and thick. Thus, if the skull had to weigh over 12 tons, it'd probably have more than doubled Triceratops' weight.\n\nMegalosaurs, some of which are not Triceratops, existed before and during the Jurassic. Triceratops was probably the most famous of these, but many other species have been found in the same part of the world. Triceratops is the only dinosaur that can hold its head up on its shoulders like this.\n\nA TINY BROWN TURTLE","token_len":610,"entropy":[10.5327,0.0779,2.194,3.6501,6.0564,0.2031,0.0048,0.0005,0.0018,2.7992,1.9773,2.0115,2.1571,2.0689,1.5995,1.0603,9.7557,8.9942,0.0125,9.538,0.0039,5.73,1.5845,1.4414,0.4431,0.6592,7.0676,0.0713,0.0011,0.0012,6.2021,0.8747,6.2002,3.6929,2.7156,0.1556,0.1733,0.6324,1.3762,3.839,0.9694,0.3422,1.3714,7.5654,4.688,0.0912,0.0001,2.1109,1.5391,4.4442,4.1086,0.0604,0.4921,3.2113,0.0066,0.0006,0.001,2.1322,0.6783,4.6189,4.7512,0.1124,3.8669,5.1833,2.6236,4.2601,2.1377,3.6752,0.962,5.8404,0.2605,3.8142,4.4999,0.0005,0.0009,0.0027,0.7248,0.9101,1.6875,0.0423,9.6385,2.7511,0.5032,0.1159,0.015,0.0039,0.0088,0.0016,0.0011,0.0009,1.6875,0.0003,0.0011,0.0011,0.0014,0.0005,0.0014,0.1798,0.0003,0.0,0.0003,0.0061,0.0016,0.0125,0.0009,0.0006,0.0005,0.0018,0.0009,0.0303,0.0023,0.0009,0.0006,0.0012,0.0028,0.0112,0.0,0.0003,0.0013,0.0008,0.0054,0.0007,0.0009,0.0012,0.01,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,0.0022,0.0009,0.001,0.0003,0.0003,0.0015,0.0002,0.0009,0.0007,0.0003,0.0003,0.0007,0.0066,0.0004,0.0014,0.0043,0.0003,0.0,0.0001,0.0022,0.0009,4.2688,4.4996,0.0024,1.8527,2.2381,2.456,0.8548,0.9637,0.6501,0.6368,3.4122,0.0016,1.2523,0.0005,4.4673,2.1084,0.0012,0.0006,0.0005,1.7292,0.1924,0.1162,0.2515,4.3508,2.8734,3.9367,1.5365,1.2578,0.9698,0.0002,5.5613,2.7932,3.7843,2.2132,0.001,0.001,0.0045,3.0226,0.9961,0.5841,0.4575,2.8939,0.3694,0.9988,0.0117,4.2249,7.3281,3.8501,2.1995,2.8151,0.9525,2.6559,2.1798,3.1292,0.0018,0.0005,0.0014,1.4673,0.2817,5.58,3.0498,1.2208,0.2573,0.4575,4.2889,5.8524,0.1806,1.1104,0.0369,0.2087,0.0006,0.001,6.5337,0.9886,2.6729,0.2803,0.0205,0.4608,2.5832,0.0062,0.0004,0.0012,3.4258,1.7988,3.5864,3.4868,0.0161,4.4535,3.7589,1.8543,0.9636,0.437,4.979,0.6561,0.4876,4.3825,0.0007,2.2345,0.0077,0.0019,0.8922,0.7133,0.9806,0.0002,7.9636,2.9807,0.0074,0.001,0.0016,2.0616,1.2446,0.2812,0.0024,0.0012,0.002,0.0015,0.0011,0.0006,0.0004,0.0035,0.001,0.0006,0.04,0.0,0.0018,0.0001,0.0006,0.0014,0.0015,4.9608,5.6793,3.0419,3.427,3.3853,1.5259,8.2272,5.8786,2.0361,3.6365,1.029,0.559,0.3658,5.3206,4.1647,4.5202,2.1082,0.7844,3.4779,2.1029,0.1426,3.1436,0.7753,3.0314,2.2224,2.6945,0.1451,2.023,3.5388,1.5093,0.0329,0.489,5.2841,1.2366,0.4998,4.8233,0.0916,0.0007,0.0031,2.7261,1.4353,4.8605,1.4881,2.9461,3.0287,2.6499,3.1841,1.8245,3.4817,3.2121,1.4603,1.0872,2.6418,1.4936,3.1779,1.3764,1.8191,1.874,4.1556,3.5904,0.9577,5.5415,4.6533,3.9086,2.469,2.6703,0.916,0.4564,3.3995,2.4013,0.0141,0.0008,0.002,2.728,0.2336,3.5043,1.7053,3.22,13.5079,1.0386,4.8984,3.8132,2.1933,2.306,1.0979,4.5232,1.6348,0.0736,1.8639,3.7388,2.9743,4.5541,4.6435,0.7404,2.9687,3.2674,3.9134,1.5071,0.9737,0.2548,5.497,0.0376,1.9647,5.9223,0.3057,1.8883,6.3182,1.1116,1.7265,3.8404,0.0581,0.7592,0.0128,0.9413,4.0026,0.9871,1.1434,0.0003,6.0162,3.2176,0.3803,0.12,0.0045,0.0014,0.0023,0.0015,0.0022,0.0008,0.0002,0.0014,0.0123,0.0008,0.001,0.002,0.0007,0.0009,0.0011,0.0002,0.0008,0.0016,0.0004,0.0011,0.0005,0.0009,0.0028,0.0008,1.1453,0.0192,0.0004,0.0015,2.5539,0.137,2.0755,0.3693,0.313,0.9478,0.5814,0.1387,0.3206,0.0464,0.0455,0.0296,7.0207,0.0722,0.0067,0.0246,0.0058,0.0009,0.0006,0.0024,0.0014,0.001,0.0002,0.0011,0.2292,0.0073,0.0771,0.0537,0.0028,0.0048,0.0479,0.0016,0.002,0.0172,0.0007,0.0015,0.0006,0.0018,0.0122,0.0013,0.9647,0.0193,0.0003,0.001,2.0971,0.1011,3.7573,3.9216,2.6945,1.5338,3.3655,1.9765,5.6003,1.1684,1.5855,3.3332,1.7547,3.0831,2.398,0.4353,2.1704,1.121,0.8533,0.5264,3.2831,1.3132,0.8926,3.147,1.5092,3.7996,1.1478,3.3518,1.4393,5.3797,0.394,4.843,2.9076,1.1402,2.2201,2.895,5.0656,3.8082,5.1607,0.621,0.3766,0.9852,5.9812,2.0697,1.0851,5.6099,0.5326,1.3883,5.0114,0.001,0.0003,0.0038,0.3708,1.2543,0.9747,0.6889,0.0002,4.7426,2.4693,2.0795,2.4597,5.5914,0.7028,1.1659,0.8943,4.7942,1.9263,0.0018,0.0004,0.0005,0.4664,5.0519,4.6423,3.574,1.0864,0.11,3.6326,1.6837,3.8289,0.0119,0.0009,0.0008,1.9944,2.2176,1.111,1.5905,2.2987,1.2375,1.2361,1.9059,1.0401,2.6898,0.6053,1.3995,4.1673,0.1834,0.5205,1.2913,1.1085,1.6903,5.425,0.0028,0.5363,0.2432,0.5849,4.5548,0.0108,0.0011,0.0013,1.7237,1.2327,1.0475,1.5069,1.4957,2.5498,6.5533,0.5535,0.077,0.1596,4.222,0.6879,1.9272,2.8735,2.0669,0.7515,0.7609,0.0002,4.2806,5.8508,5.8872,0.0102,5.7388,1.269,3.0498,2.3344,0.1164,0.0008]}

Both involve noise, some form of melody (usually synthesized), but in the case of industrial and industrial rock, often instrumental and, in industrial metal, using bass and drums to create a groove, so some form of rhythm is present.\n\nGlitch noise (sometimes called chiptune, electroacoustic and the artform known as \"chiptune music\") uses a variety of synthesizers (often sampled, but other hardware is also present) to play sounds, which may (and frequently do) overlap with the sounds of the standard \"industrial\" genres. Glitch noise is a subgenre of noise music, and there are other subgenres in this genre. For more information as to how the genres are related, please check out this Wikipedia article.\n\nIndustrial fusion metal (also called extreme metal, post-industrial metal and extreme hard rock) is generally regarded as a subgenre of industrial metal, and is characterized by a combination of synthesizer music (\"synth-metal\") and heavy drums and bass, mostly using electric guitars.\n\nThe subgenre of glitch noise known as chiptune music incorporates chiptune music, but also utilizes synthesizer music (which is sometimes processed to include synthesizers that emulate the rhythm of the music) used to help create a rhythm similar to that of a keyboard, the use of drums and occasionally guitar and bass to create a groove, and frequently uses a sequencer or drum machine to help with the composition. Additionally, some modern chiptuners also utilize random and static music to add a bit of additional variety to their creations.

{"id":655,"ended":true,"length":515,"gen_text":"Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State returned the ball to the 27 @ - @ yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short touchdown pass from NC State QB Justin Thomas to C.J. Anderson.\n\nThe kickoff went through and the Wolfpack did not take any chances on the ensuing kick to start their next play. With the Wolfpack on their own 26-yard line, Thomas passed to Jalen Rhodes for six yards on the team's opening play, and the Wolfpack had a 3rd and 1 at NC State's 43-yard line.\n\nThe Wolfpack forced the two-point conversion, but NC State chose to punt on their first drive of the final quarter to go up by one. A few minutes later, on their second offensive play, the Wolfpack faced a 4th and 1 at the NC State 30-yard line.\n\nThis time, the Wolfpack chose to go for the long field goal. They went three and out again, however, and the Wolfpack had a 4th and 20 at the 14.\n\nNorth Carolina State faced a fourth and one at their 41-yard line. The Wolfpack had a 3rd and long at the 17-yard line. From there, NC State started the drive, but the Wolfpack offense stalled out.\n\nInstead, the Wolfpack had to settle for a 24-yard field goal from NC State kicker Ryan Tisdale, who made the winning kick of the game. The two points put the Wolfpack up 28-23.

{"id":2137,"ended":true,"length":575,"gen_text":"The Panic of 1873 led to growing criticism of high finance and the spread of radical Antisemitism, which in the 1880s became a broad undercurrent. These criticisms saw a separation of capital into \"great\" and \"small\" players, as banks, insurance companies and industrial trading firms were seen as monopolistic and prone to speculation. During the 1920s, the movement in the United States culminated with the formation of the Federal Reserve, which forced the growth of national banks and the regulation and restriction of the larger ones.\n\nThese policies lead to much less political instability than was witnessed in Britain between the World Wars, but this instability eventually proved to be an impediment to further economic reforms. In the US, the political landscape was made more unstable by the creation of Social Security in 1935. This policy increased the need to cut costs by cutting staff and increasing unemployment. Despite considerable campaigning by the American people, the legislation won with little less than a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and a similar majority in the House. Social Security eventually became the model for modern Social Security.\n\nPolitical instability led ultimately to the defeat of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies in the 1930s, with the Democrats losing control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time since 1920. FDR's policies sought to alleviate the suffering of the Great Depression by implementing the most radical economic reforms in the country's history. Facing huge public opposition, he turned to the newly emerging political left for political support, particularly on the issue of unemployment relief. At the same time, he established as a precedent the New Deal that would guide future government policies to deal with subsequent crises such as the Great Depression. During the first half of the 1930s, unemployment rose above 6% and was only finally brought down in 1937 by wage and price controls.\n\nThere has been a very long-term relationship between economic and political stability in the United States. Since 1880, the US has seen six presidents elected for two consecutive terms. Only two presidents have lasted out their terms (Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and Jimmy Carter in 1976) and the next shortest-serving president was George W. Bush in 2001 until his resignation in 2009 due to the 9\/11 attacks.\n\nIt has been proposed that the stability of the United States, not its democracy, is the fundamental attribute of its success. That is, the success of the United States can be viewed as partly the direct result of the ability of democracy to provide a system of checks and balances to protect the rights of citizens from being exploited by those in power. In a democracy people have a right to be represented and to have policies that reflect their will. Hence, democratic institutions and processes provide checks and balances on the behavior of the government. As a consequence political instability results from a lack of respect for the constitutional order that the democratic system provides, and ultimately threatens the long-term viability of democracy, thus necessitating more democratic institutions to maintain the stability of the system.","token_len":611,"entropy":[12.2189,2.0975,0.6162,3.9226,5.4268,0.2342,8.3423,4.7064,0.3769,6.5802,3.6994,1.1196,1.3738,6.5842,0.0067,6.3759,11.8407,4.3134,0.5621,0.0569,2.04,1.8208,3.2481,2.3072,3.4538,0.2288,2.8233,1.4399,5.7862,8.0427,0.0399,4.0392,5.0841,3.0274,6.6548,2.2811,9.6867,0.5806,4.9305,4.2586,3.0746,5.1434,1.1181,0.3039,0.0424,0.183,0.1726,3.9227,0.758,3.1331,5.5817,3.0625,1.6784,0.0878,1.007,2.4668,6.3191,1.2786,1.5114,3.1791,0.2521,3.876,1.3337,0.9876,4.6285,0.0084,3.4794,0.4573,5.5443,0.4146,4.8361,0.0161,0.7511,1.2537,5.4415,4.0252,1.4016,1.3306,0.0263,5.0441,1.8514,0.2272,2.3726,0.0337,0.1571,2.3737,0.1216,2.0619,0.8045,5.8421,1.0567,5.1658,0.0494,4.1667,0.6204,1.1196,1.55,5.2605,3.6026,3.6824,0.0086,1.559,4.3287,2.6917,0.2596,1.0359,0.0035,4.685,4.1156,6.0858,0.1199,6.3422,4.3371,4.7087,4.3085,1.5928,4.0136,4.2344,0.5086,3.2027,4.3261,0.8901,4.973,0.0164,0.9041,1.7515,3.5778,4.051,5.0637,4.7318,0.9358,0.0407,3.1234,2.1879,0.0021,0.1301,4.0779,1.1212,4.6365,0.4322,2.1562,0.7103,3.702,0.2055,0.8553,4.3876,4.2569,1.3938,5.4508,0.9505,1.4116,0.4902,0.2595,4.3947,0.0444,6.5566,0.0146,1.0194,0.2645,1.5214,2.1134,3.456,5.5395,0.4547,4.2426,2.0725,4.4446,3.5551,2.4083,2.1544,5.447,0.7825,3.4173,3.1302,1.0857,5.1927,6.23,5.8181,1.2497,1.47,1.9398,4.798,0.4213,0.908,3.8178,6.6451,4.379,5.1367,5.88,0.0176,1.5375,1.083,0.1983,0.1099,0.0732,1.288,0.7054,1.0708,1.6749,1.2062,2.2571,1.5983,0.8837,0.0366,0.0356,0.0152,0.8395,3.4447,0.0075,4.7267,1.1688,1.3584,4.6471,0.1544,5.5926,3.8347,0.1662,2.2936,0.3745,0.0002,5.3656,1.5578,3.3397,6.3533,0.0163,0.4892,5.0281,0.0576,3.7175,0.9313,0.517,0.1765,0.0013,1.0976,0.4249,0.0004,2.3504,0.9564,0.665,1.1838,0.0264,1.2994,3.0086,0.5665,4.7053,1.0757,0.7228,0.0311,1.2584,1.5877,1.718,0.0273,0.1591,0.2219,0.5756,0.0023,3.1204,0.1377,0.0583,0.0103,0.7151,5.0865,0.0894,4.8895,1.0555,1.5632,5.1025,0.0456,3.374,0.7964,3.4457,0.3336,0.2559,0.9154,0.0005,0.9869,3.513,2.4847,2.6425,1.6877,1.3954,0.7163,1.0132,1.4207,1.5391,0.0893,0.0338,0.4268,5.936,1.9397,4.7408,2.3594,0.3913,0.4272,1.7351,5.6379,0.126,0.8565,5.4867,4.9849,4.4687,2.1168,2.9152,3.6875,0.1118,1.1057,3.4269,4.2042,0.7008,0.4303,0.0019,2.4018,1.5391,0.1791,5.7443,0.4254,0.5463,0.0019,0.064,1.1172,4.5066,7.0982,1.2969,3.2031,2.7127,5.4708,0.0014,5.6891,0.9646,4.5417,2.661,3.0531,1.3482,4.0362,2.2022,0.003,4.9039,3.2183,3.4045,0.0024,0.3732,1.0571,0.0872,1.09,5.6923,0.6118,4.0871,2.68,0.0037,0.0881,0.3839,0.0028,0.0776,2.1614,2.6153,3.3633,4.24,1.2812,1.063,3.4025,4.0528,2.7761,0.914,0.4582,1.7846,2.1782,1.9455,5.8704,0.6532,0.0059,0.049,0.6427,0.6846,0.0002,5.7899,3.5824,0.2785,1.1579,5.411,2.091,1.4009,0.8438,3.0343,0.0395,1.5656,2.4419,0.1875,0.7852,1.2653,0.3334,0.5943,0.034,0.5359,3.9507,5.7148,0.0768,0.7543,2.4608,0.3551,2.9585,3.6282,1.816,2.7139,3.4866,2.0982,3.6164,0.0326,1.0903,3.7671,2.1452,1.3873,0.9067,3.7939,6.5456,0.5778,2.4852,3.5812,3.6561,0.0256,0.0008,0.3991,0.0159,0.0028,1.5889,1.7113,0.2346,3.0644,0.0076,0.0451,1.0619,1.9345,0.4857,2.211,4.7432,5.4093,2.0603,0.5446,0.4027,1.3755,2.9506,1.2131,0.0226,0.0023,1.9919,1.2249,5.4048,1.4234,1.8458,0.46,0.2087,4.2499,0.0038,1.6103,2.9211,0.0194,0.0007,0.5557,0.1188,1.3125,0.0002,5.0661,2.2028,0.5658,5.2817,0.1997,0.9314,3.6792,0.3477,0.2443,1.0896,0.0066,4.0626,4.7937,1.5168,3.5282,0.1138,0.477,0.7461,3.7569,5.1498,1.1388,0.9294,1.397,0.4023,6.013,0.886,0.3891,1.3133,3.3846,0.0537,0.2455,0.8508,0.0018,2.2969,0.1208,4.1703,0.2751,6.527,2.1353,4.9953,0.3856,0.0066,1.2804,5.0944,0.2857,4.8385,0.0741,2.3387,1.423,4.3127,0.4873,0.3937,0.0342,0.0066,2.0483,2.9748,0.7956,1.3305,0.206,2.4042,2.5656,4.2469,4.2023,0.2627,2.7381,0.5562,0.2215,0.1851,2.8198,2.8908,1.8623,6.7768,1.5577,1.2735,2.2907,0.0363,2.5596,1.8649,2.0123,1.5093,0.9311,6.6885,1.7067,1.6663,0.2175,2.2516,0.4136,6.0854,0.3734,3.4852,1.6812,2.7165,2.0787,2.3206,1.9467,0.1595,0.0161,1.8985,0.4937,5.68,0.044,1.314,1.2515,1.187,3.898,1.5521,2.0134,7.0755,0.978,4.7071,2.0529,3.068,0.859,0.0114,4.5854,0.0623,0.8797,4.7185,2.0123,3.7124,3.234,2.7623,1.2112,1.0249,2.052,1.2305,4.9317,4.4809,0.2931,4.345,0.069,0.0208,1.9301,0.0276,1.5571,3.9307,4.3208,5.2147,0.0014,4.2195,2.3213,0.7048,1.6499,2.4389,1.032,1.2879,0.2538,0.5911,0.8969,0.1109]}
{"id":4387,"ended":false,"length":573,"gen_text":"After the breakup of the Butterfield Blues Band and no longer under contract with Elektra, Butterfield retreated to Woodstock, New York, where he eventually formed his next band, Paul Butterfield's Rhythm & Blues Orchestra. He would be killed by unknown gunmen in the early hours of October 31, 1969; according to the New York Post, \"a man walked up to the stage, shot a gun, and shot Butterfield in the back.\" The shooting was said to have taken place at Butterfield's New York residence.\n\n\nOne of his original bands, he formed a new group with his friend Billy Strayhorn called The Blues & The Roots. On January 4, 1970, he and Strayhorn performed with The Beatles on a BBC Introducing New Beatles Sessions with songs such as \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and \"A Day in the Life\"; on January 5, another Beatles group with the Beatles' George Harrison was also featured. In 1970, John Lennon's solo debut, Please Please Me, was recorded, and it became one of the most successful albums of the year, selling some 20 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nJohn Lennon later called Butterfield \"one of the best songwriters in the world\" and one of the last great songwriters in American popular music. Butterfield recorded his last album, The Beatles, in 1970. When asked by The Times newspaper (London, U.K.) why he is rarely included on American lists of \"the greatest\" songwriters, he replied: \"I don't think that anybody has got two days' talent. The two days are called life.\" On February 3, 1971, Butterfield released his final album, The Blues And The Roots, which contained \"Come Back, Little Susie,\" a gospel song originally written by George Jones. It was his last album; at the age of 58, he was found dead in his apartment in Los Angeles on April 28, 1971.\n\n\nIn 1971, Butterfield released the album A Love Supreme - a set of original Blues songs recorded with his close friend and fellow Blues and Roots musician, Billy Strayhorn, produced by John Lennon. The album went gold, selling over 8 million copies worldwide until 1981. In 1982, the film Blues and Roots did turn the spotlight on John Lennon, but did not do the album justice, and it was seen as one of The Beatles'low points.\n\n\nJohn Lennon said in a 1993 interview that Butterfield's death \"was absolutely crushing.\" One of the many musicians whom John liked, Butterfield introduced John to George Harrison after they met in 1961. Lennon also wrote a song for this album, \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", which became one of The Beatles'hits, and was widely regarded as one of the band's best songs.\n\n\nIn a 2003 interview for BBC's Live Aid tour, John Lennon described the recording of Abbey Road as the greatest experience of his life.\n\nHe was born on August 9, 1926, in West Point, New York","token_len":611,"entropy":[1.9443,7.3492,0.7187,0.4709,14.5326,3.2173,4.1919,0.2089,3.3229,9.4887,0.6694,4.3167,2.9068,0.8237,5.6086,0.0276,0.0008,0.7953,4.565,0.0145,8.1592,0.714,6.2012,0.021,0.5931,0.896,0.003,0.645,0.824,0.1105,5.5459,2.2894,1.0363,7.2143,0.4351,0.274,7.1865,0.0202,0.003,3.5485,5.1472,1.8311,0.0152,1.8336,0.4949,2.4131,3.2074,3.9139,5.0466,2.2412,6.7465,2.5148,1.065,2.6632,1.5843,1.4133,0.0119,2.8118,2.9934,0.1445,2.2818,5.3674,4.7828,0.0031,1.5933,1.4285,0.0249,3.3318,0.204,2.3137,2.7992,2.707,3.5517,1.3376,0.2491,0.9863,1.8395,1.8805,1.368,5.1452,2.6073,1.3401,0.4575,2.5296,0.5073,0.0044,1.3841,0.0422,1.3572,1.2619,2.2335,3.8665,1.426,4.8561,0.0226,0.3481,1.7102,0.0072,1.3305,3.3639,0.0049,0.0117,3.0848,0.047,2.9141,0.7698,2.9384,0.0003,5.3374,0.406,1.9019,5.592,2.5183,0.3698,5.3609,2.4544,2.1254,1.1208,1.3938,1.777,2.415,2.6606,4.7983,2.9869,0.0073,0.0004,1.5963,1.9372,3.2161,5.8129,3.1274,3.2282,1.0592,5.1119,2.6528,3.3887,0.0369,0.5538,0.143,1.7922,2.1404,0.347,0.0005,0.0016,2.9463,3.0219,2.1929,4.9462,1.9129,2.8734,4.5221,6.9218,0.1164,3.2401,2.6699,2.5997,5.324,5.9335,2.6533,0.0019,0.6571,2.4392,1.7028,2.6695,0.0128,0.6598,0.1853,0.0466,3.2632,0.6667,0.5914,0.0084,0.0006,4.6776,2.68,1.7063,2.5532,0.0984,6.8408,2.7044,3.1472,4.4901,2.7563,3.633,0.9539,2.5898,0.0561,4.082,2.6063,1.7874,1.5475,3.0154,1.897,0.1721,5.2315,0.2229,3.4218,2.8456,1.9229,1.3691,2.8811,0.0179,0.0018,0.1472,0.4272,3.0129,3.0318,0.9426,2.4053,2.389,2.2147,0.0025,0.1909,1.0123,0.9764,1.4106,0.2694,1.042,1.7584,2.2553,0.6482,5.4662,3.739,0.0767,0.0339,1.2681,0.1862,1.0449,0.0003,3.9965,0.5626,3.9284,3.7205,0.7636,0.0017,0.7376,1.3787,0.0032,0.1947,2.9069,4.1342,0.064,1.9009,0.3835,0.4126,1.8437,0.2929,3.1796,0.0384,0.3628,5.0034,1.3588,3.0172,0.1028,1.9742,3.903,1.6507,0.0357,0.3354,2.5991,0.0031,4.4241,2.4647,1.3972,0.5733,0.5046,1.9484,5.0362,2.3016,0.4365,2.0753,0.8807,5.4428,1.6923,2.0546,2.7578,2.9626,4.0548,5.1884,0.6993,1.994,3.1594,0.0004,0.0041,0.1192,2.7304,0.2374,5.6197,4.9445,3.1667,1.6583,4.6008,3.9573,0.0384,2.1513,1.5015,1.2721,3.5647,0.6808,0.029,0.5011,1.1746,0.8876,1.2763,0.1041,1.0851,1.4091,0.0009,1.3595,2.804,3.7045,2.29,5.5645,6.2504,5.6419,1.2809,5.8356,1.7116,3.39,5.3265,0.4409,2.0391,5.4272,0.4553,1.5924,4.0647,2.2494,3.271,0.019,1.2024,0.06,1.3013,0.0018,3.9031,0.8331,1.4442,0.3331,0.2054,1.7597,2.0418,4.2473,0.087,0.0052,0.9925,1.031,2.6286,3.6109,5.3865,2.8334,1.6184,0.4372,0.7255,0.0033,0.9131,2.2429,6.5083,1.1618,3.2062,0.7366,0.3369,3.5208,2.1162,0.9492,2.823,0.7439,2.2106,0.4517,1.107,4.5487,4.7734,0.3242,1.5165,0.0012,4.0239,0.1533,0.269,2.1716,1.3295,0.0747,0.6952,0.245,2.1169,1.114,3.2008,0.0053,2.1859,2.1854,3.8487,0.0634,0.0994,0.3076,1.2439,0.0002,2.3485,3.8559,0.0996,1.2343,0.0035,3.3034,2.0457,1.661,4.117,3.5453,0.3259,6.1952,1.5854,4.5138,0.1441,3.8491,3.495,1.444,2.2636,1.4462,1.7644,4.8608,0.0917,1.7655,1.7265,1.7587,2.3242,0.0728,1.144,1.4274,1.7877,0.0436,0.0001,0.0005,2.3587,5.4706,0.0841,2.4069,1.188,0.5737,1.2354,0.4497,3.4515,1.4546,1.714,2.6294,1.0907,4.5162,0.0708,0.0344,1.1341,8.7341,4.3621,0.4978,2.1032,3.3458,0.0638,2.2903,4.4931,3.0752,1.7801,0.571,7.4575,6.9555,2.7207,0.9784,0.3668,2.7651,1.8194,1.3188,2.3018,4.3776,0.2212,3.5915,3.2691,4.0715,0.2901,2.1329,1.565,2.2371,1.0115,5.8016,0.5691,3.2911,0.116,4.692,0.0343,0.0959,15.2335,0.8145,0.3882,0.9933,0.0002,1.9408,0.3014,2.9876,2.1511,1.4588,4.2777,0.15,1.3605,2.1535,0.0024,1.3646,2.6822,1.87,1.6289,5.6617,5.6565,2.0852,5.8551,0.5151,0.7179,3.4523,3.5797,4.608,2.4189,5.9445,1.0138,0.6435,0.0014,6.172,1.6932,0.4718,3.7806,0.1176,4.576,1.9394,0.7856,0.9173,3.9498,0.8786,2.6133,3.2919,3.5872,1.7653,0.4491,1.2177,5.7437,1.0193,0.8746,0.3677,5.4116,1.5823,2.6293,0.5776,0.0362,3.4203,0.6526,3.1362,1.7816,0.0023,2.527,0.0068,0.0664,11.3433,0.6065,2.3538,0.8576,1.6218,5.7978,2.5357,0.1195,0.616,0.0039,0.655,2.9821,0.0032,0.8363,0.6817,0.2159,0.827,0.0002,1.6792,3.3702,3.2093,0.2302,3.7753,2.5619,2.8406,5.3429,3.9343,5.3261,0.1398,0.7205,0.2848,3.251,2.1266,3.1062,0.3383,6.6009,0.0004,0.7312,1.9558,2.5339,1.6514,0.081,0.02,0.1461,0.5333,4.5161,0.0001,5.0126,0.8531,2.1776,1.6398,2.7282,3.5092,0.0179,2.3577,0.592,0.0976,5.2724,5.0497,0.0176,0.1096,0.0022]}

{"id":4201,"ended":false,"length":574,"gen_text":"Martinsburg, West Virginia, businessman C. Leslie Golliday filed the initial application for the station with the FCC on September 1, 1954. In the application, Golliday estimated construction costs at $1.8 million, which would be paid by the public utility. Golliday told the FCC that with public funding, the station should be operational by the end of the 1963 year, but he could not provide a specific timetable. The FCC determined that the proposed station had been built after filing its application, so it didn't count it on the FCC's official timetable.\n\nThe station was actually finished and in operation for approximately eight years. The FCC noted that the station was not yet transmitting and that it could have been moved or made more powerful, since it lacked a permanent antenna. A change of location to a field outside the city limits of West Virginia did result in a change in the direction of the station's transmitter. The station received signals from a number of television cameras from around the world, most notably from the White House, and from the U.S. Armed Forces television station, which was on the other side of the country. In fact, during a broadcast of the BBC on October 9, 1963, the station was the first station to broadcast the American news from London.\n\nThe next day, October 10, the station transmitted the first test of its experimental \"automatic switch\" feature. Automatic switch meant that the audio tape would switch channels automatically when the radio changed its frequency. This is the first use of automated television transmission at a remote location. When Golliday requested a delay in the broadcast of a test of the automatic switch feature for a news program, he received a letter from the FCC that read: \"We have received no reports that the automatic switch on this broadcast was used in this case.\"\n\nAs the TV broadcast of television news in the United States increased in output, the need for additional station locations in less populated areas grew. At this time, the FCC granted requests for a few locations to be added to the stations already in existence. Golliday's request was given preliminary approval, but approval was denied because of possible interference with stations in Baltimore, Pennsylvania, that were on at the same time. Because of this situation, Golliday requested that additional locations be granted.\n\nWhen Golliday asked for the additional slots, The station's director of engineering, J.W. Johnson, explained that they would only make the station's transmitter larger \u2013 its width and height were both to be increased by 20 percent. Furthermore, he told Golliday that \"we would keep a man in this building to insure that the new switch system is operated correctly and to prevent that unnecessary noise that is so widely reported.\"\n\n\"My request to allow me to add two additional stations, one in West Virginia and one in Alabama, is denied... \"\n\n\u2013 J.W. \"Billy\" Johnson, Director, Engineering, T&E Broadcasting, Inc., filing with the FCC","token_len":612,"entropy":[5.0074,2.3619,0.4326,1.5215,0.0113,1.3734,11.3594,7.0437,0.2487,8.4137,6.0037,7.3242,5.0759,6.0712,3.0211,4.6514,3.9793,1.442,0.9166,7.6413,3.4174,0.1879,1.3734,1.949,3.119,3.1699,0.0907,4.8754,0.3034,3.1209,1.9776,1.7472,0.2184,0.5172,0.0011,0.0034,6.0141,4.8352,1.0397,0.6218,0.2084,2.3734,0.6057,2.8117,0.0438,1.1887,2.6055,1.8475,1.3985,1.3524,1.5041,1.2836,4.3569,3.0605,3.1493,2.7809,0.0011,0.0032,5.0279,0.1975,0.6306,0.3936,6.7447,4.3033,1.7321,0.4726,0.8064,0.4162,3.9937,0.6916,2.7107,0.612,1.5049,0.9542,0.0015,1.6698,6.7946,4.4683,1.6711,1.8353,1.8686,3.9743,0.1617,1.4474,0.9707,1.9912,2.6873,0.356,1.7893,1.0098,6.0069,0.3311,0.7864,2.7469,0.7244,3.4071,3.7137,3.9678,5.3775,5.7403,2.2786,1.9234,0.9374,2.852,1.1351,5.7982,0.0007,3.7879,2.7122,4.9856,0.5396,2.0802,0.0534,4.7522,2.7636,0.3165,0.911,0.0032,1.604,1.2784,1.0868,4.649,4.0992,2.1108,1.727,0.6587,3.0454,5.1009,3.5653,1.0801,1.4443,2.0418,1.5179,4.0539,0.5607,0.9306,0.6446,1.3091,3.0482,3.414,3.6337,3.0904,1.1632,1.3446,3.2236,3.149,0.6533,3.7898,3.3082,5.636,2.4062,1.6107,2.3803,5.7387,1.138,4.0159,1.0844,4.2,1.0117,0.4104,4.6366,5.2979,1.7201,3.4516,2.6092,1.1663,4.2075,3.4275,1.2374,0.8633,1.7528,0.9969,1.6999,0.0186,2.7803,5.0729,0.0036,1.2344,2.1719,0.7577,0.9513,4.2919,0.1434,0.3362,1.6548,0.4353,2.6982,1.1374,1.629,0.8971,3.8586,3.3331,0.3603,2.3457,1.6744,0.0028,3.4402,6.6811,4.8046,1.6605,0.0232,1.8263,0.8253,4.5928,0.7427,0.4924,0.9277,5.9079,0.166,1.7258,2.1212,2.2201,1.5623,2.5684,0.0233,0.0293,0.0113,4.3952,0.048,4.9301,1.7541,1.7019,1.4856,1.2285,3.9888,1.3265,3.2426,0.1839,0.0021,0.1019,1.0167,0.5076,3.0821,4.2855,0.0114,4.0047,2.8653,4.265,1.8338,0.7402,5.3551,3.7662,2.5462,3.4575,0.0332,2.3917,0.0485,0.9565,1.193,1.5158,2.3133,1.6968,2.3769,0.8135,2.0048,2.4094,4.7286,4.6626,2.7017,2.2843,0.769,0.5356,0.0002,1.4337,6.1088,2.9979,0.1127,2.1969,0.0761,0.0381,1.4595,1.407,2.9073,1.8127,0.5021,3.7699,2.5832,1.5416,5.1346,2.8199,5.8589,4.6892,1.4344,4.0677,0.9304,4.0583,0.3394,4.09,0.087,0.9694,5.6772,5.1094,1.5697,2.4547,3.9526,1.1344,1.6103,0.8128,4.1436,5.9936,2.3799,1.5222,0.4502,2.026,4.9222,1.779,1.3646,3.1208,0.0429,3.7796,4.3696,1.7113,4.1852,1.1655,6.4356,1.1642,0.6313,4.3892,4.2433,0.0043,0.0045,4.3845,1.7014,5.045,0.9306,0.6098,3.7885,1.0355,1.7515,3.041,1.3883,0.4623,1.1238,0.0694,0.8976,4.0543,1.8455,5.5652,2.501,0.4346,1.6758,2.393,0.5253,1.7701,0.4257,0.3208,0.2924,3.0284,2.9458,1.013,0.5394,2.1634,1.823,1.9951,2.2748,4.332,2.0422,1.0077,1.4921,0.2581,4.6377,1.375,4.3548,1.6552,2.8507,2.309,2.8276,2.988,0.7013,0.8319,0.0002,4.2529,1.3074,5.4306,2.4757,1.9402,5.5449,1.2122,4.1731,0.5229,0.5322,0.006,3.1868,1.1856,6.9633,0.5688,1.0168,2.7327,0.0853,3.8077,4.6564,1.2668,3.0107,5.0755,0.4748,0.1328,2.4493,0.3429,3.8723,2.8928,0.3354,0.0949,1.1326,0.4407,3.6168,4.6652,0.9152,2.9105,3.5376,3.5865,2.0724,1.0299,1.2209,0.15,0.2597,4.2678,2.4229,0.7176,2.3439,0.5151,3.036,0.0012,0.0049,1.6556,1.9235,1.1081,5.9395,3.8578,0.0553,2.0944,0.8793,4.6918,0.3349,1.5303,2.3235,1.42,5.8908,0.6405,0.849,4.481,1.1104,4.7156,0.9392,3.3412,0.9324,3.7181,0.6372,3.9977,5.5236,0.0394,0.4808,0.0217,0.2501,5.0519,0.7294,1.0858,4.0036,0.0331,0.9887,0.0005,0.0021,2.6969,1.7268,4.5394,1.6067,0.1693,2.655,1.6066,1.5329,0.0002,4.3349,1.9153,0.0005,0.0036,2.964,1.0103,2.6106,2.4351,6.1782,0.8318,7.6365,5.6977,2.0567,3.2834,0.9165,1.5345,0.7369,3.9511,0.0312,3.4902,0.0035,4.7828,0.0536,3.5112,0.38,3.4943,1.5763,2.7357,4.8813,1.8908,2.1363,2.7216,2.8121,1.8759,6.0527,5.3699,5.1963,2.1148,0.2582,1.7011,3.5197,3.7528,0.1523,0.6105,1.1885,4.0347,1.113,0.4503,5.8529,0.0043,3.0211,2.826,0.5663,0.0003,0.0024,0.2908,3.7644,3.6918,2.031,5.3856,3.6239,5.5479,2.1212,4.0423,1.8638,2.6341,5.0075,0.5306,1.1339,2.4075,5.0618,2.6223,1.7212,3.0097,2.2134,1.9856,2.4046,3.6319,5.4969,6.1294,2.9197,2.4764,1.8723,2.6025,6.4787,1.4604,1.0723,1.0082,0.0002,5.5077,5.6661,3.8802,2.794,5.4123,2.8609,0.2081,2.4555,2.8268,1.2087,0.8441,3.242,2.1915,0.7234,1.4926,0.0163,0.1534,0.2265,0.0931,3.491,0.1437,2.2815,1.1937,6.5384,3.6219,0.4628,0.0001,4.5297,3.1219,0.0212,0.195,0.0032,5.9745,4.1867,0.0103,0.0764,0.4516,1.58,1.786,1.3493,0.8571,5.8782,5.2176,1.2503,2.1786,1.2616,0.9468,0.7449,5.3307,2.0531,0.1664,0.1282]}
{"id":1225,"ended":true,"length":550,"gen_text":"On February 26, 1957, Wilhelm was traded by the Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals for Whitey Lockman. At the time of the trade, St. Louis manager Fred Hutchinson described Wilhelm's arm as one that could \"carry anything except the heaviest weights\": \"[W]e'll have to say that he'll have the heaviest hands we've ever witnessed. We're really excited about this one.\" The following season, Wilhelm recorded his first career three-hit game and won his first game. He received a contract for 1954, and on April 10th, he became the first Giants player to start a game in the All-Star game. The following year, he threw a one-hitter and picked off two runners on a single at-bat. On June 28th, the Tigers scored three runs in one inning to take a 6-1 Giants lead.\n\nIn the 1954 World Series, the Giants were swept by the Cincinnati Reds. The next year, the club picked up the contract of Cy Young. After a mediocre 1954, however, the Giants hit.231 and failed to win their first World Series since 1916. This prompted Giamatti to make the decision to move on. It would later be described by a number of journalists as the hardest decision he ever made. Wilhelm recorded his last major league appearance on July 5, 1955 in Pittsburgh. The Yankees returned the favor in 1956 and earned the best record in the American League. Over 15 seasons, the Giants won five World Series, including four in a row between 1951 and 1955. At the end of his career, as a member of New York, Wilhelm had completed a 728 inning scoreless streak and he had a career pitching record of 138-61 with a 3.32 ERA. In his final season, he led the league with a league-leading 8.7 K\/9 and a 3.53 ERA.\n\nAfter a successful playing career, Wilhelm took up coaching. On June 14, 1987, the Hall of Fame inducted Wilhelm as a Giant. In 1988, Wilhelm was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, where he still serves today as a vice-chair.\n\nHis playing career ended not after the final at bat or before the final out of the World Series, but after having watched his favorite team beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 5 of the NLCS: 7-6. He had one last home run off New York's Jim Deshaies, on the very last day of the NLCS, to clinch the pennant for the Giants. As a player, he was an exceptional defensive player, an accomplished baserunner, and a player whose skill at the plate was matched only by his humility. It is a shame that more does not recognize our great leader.\n\n\u2013 Mike Todaro, writer for The San Francisco Chronicle (1978\u20131989) and San Francisco Chronicle Senior Writer (1947\u20131984),\n\nMike Todaro was a senior writer with the San Francisco Chronicle until his death in 1985.","token_len":613,"entropy":[4.8954,3.3485,0.2883,6.9279,0.1616,10.385,3.7437,8.5949,3.2268,0.1876,4.807,0.1216,0.0661,3.8617,0.0201,0.01,0.2282,0.7558,7.0577,0.0281,3.8162,0.0269,1.1745,4.3023,0.3634,0.2147,1.1047,0.3134,0.225,0.1171,6.6719,0.0136,0.0038,5.0377,5.0707,4.5037,3.808,0.2352,2.2136,5.18,0.1333,5.2664,1.683,2.0875,0.9802,3.132,5.719,4.9407,2.7663,3.4277,3.0653,6.8116,6.3446,2.5983,0.2866,0.674,3.8489,1.844,0.4254,4.2825,0.918,1.4179,3.3697,1.8472,2.5496,2.473,3.5849,2.9172,0.3651,0.2329,7.7022,1.9403,3.1322,2.0602,4.6654,3.6306,0.3553,2.6548,3.0401,0.5886,2.7981,3.1424,1.0351,0.1561,0.7195,4.3999,1.8427,0.6601,1.6031,4.4297,0.0807,0.4674,0.0514,2.2842,3.8357,1.4756,0.242,4.0457,3.1221,1.689,5.8469,1.1463,3.6613,1.8771,5.347,1.2767,1.8641,3.7709,2.0709,3.326,2.556,0.5419,1.4108,2.0815,0.0731,0.4325,3.2275,0.8032,0.1785,4.6608,1.0264,0.5517,1.2969,1.1135,2.8169,0.0687,0.0157,2.6924,0.5533,2.8953,1.7177,1.1281,0.1184,0.9718,6.0215,0.9368,3.6843,0.0307,0.6655,0.0004,2.2079,5.1892,2.9095,2.6316,0.5551,4.0082,1.7606,1.9457,3.986,0.9709,0.0012,0.5553,2.549,1.8749,3.3435,0.8733,0.073,2.6127,6.2181,4.3974,1.5128,0.1467,0.5942,4.5539,0.0907,1.3381,1.4053,0.2597,2.4181,0.0794,2.4931,8.899,0.0414,1.3196,3.2239,0.0035,1.8797,2.6559,2.7366,1.0584,0.0046,0.1221,0.8979,0.3697,2.1093,0.9357,0.3431,0.1272,3.1897,0.008,0.894,2.2195,2.5699,0.7295,0.0647,1.0754,4.4094,5.4288,0.1178,2.6941,3.8815,0.3871,5.5759,0.1264,1.8689,3.2226,1.8508,3.8032,2.9489,1.277,4.3291,0.0023,1.0941,0.7041,5.5552,8.2782,7.6416,1.8216,4.2943,0.0087,1.5467,2.6931,0.5091,1.0745,0.0266,0.8182,3.0707,0.0989,4.7399,3.9628,6.0167,3.823,0.931,0.1775,3.7299,1.419,1.3839,0.0918,2.6686,1.6788,1.7879,5.4264,2.762,4.4219,0.2294,5.1065,1.6158,3.3788,3.7897,0.0021,4.6545,0.2887,1.8023,3.8134,0.896,0.8319,0.7577,0.6344,0.3813,4.1006,5.7412,1.6237,1.1392,1.4474,0.1765,3.7341,0.613,1.8206,3.2612,0.7034,0.5622,3.7559,3.643,0.5425,2.7867,4.9744,6.0874,1.1535,0.1917,1.9573,0.4224,2.2109,5.4534,1.1331,4.4199,0.1334,0.062,0.5954,0.6931,0.0049,0.7063,5.9754,6.9592,2.1054,0.6925,2.5868,0.9157,1.735,2.6918,2.0586,0.1227,2.0889,2.3281,2.3772,0.9817,0.4698,0.0462,2.1632,4.2192,0.1763,1.2812,0.1422,5.1248,0.4419,1.5281,0.0111,1.5768,0.3967,0.0699,7.5945,1.2524,0.8031,0.0031,6.7138,0.0033,1.149,0.3548,2.4145,5.6792,2.2677,5.5052,4.6797,3.8334,1.9989,0.0005,0.0404,1.9632,4.9374,1.7516,1.5105,1.3086,5.9423,1.3557,0.0234,5.2775,0.1531,4.5249,1.2895,0.3157,1.1557,0.0031,4.4922,0.2115,0.1941,2.7905,2.2753,1.4354,1.1183,0.5971,0.9482,2.5629,0.0887,1.0324,1.1305,1.3701,4.4754,0.3623,0.6736,4.3928,0.4756,3.3355,2.6117,0.0104,0.034,1.2369,1.2656,2.4008,0.0109,4.6494,0.0745,0.2138,0.9568,0.0002,3.3094,3.0541,3.3698,2.4075,0.0101,0.2216,0.1267,4.1036,1.9167,1.5578,0.9982,3.7087,2.0711,3.46,0.2251,5.0242,0.0869,2.6323,5.1109,0.0155,0.237,1.2303,0.6996,0.543,1.0708,0.4941,6.9279,0.9265,2.1349,3.6165,0.0903,1.3574,0.6823,4.6305,0.8744,0.0431,1.0783,0.1342,0.0017,0.0018,2.2951,2.1253,0.0623,4.033,2.8289,2.0569,0.9396,0.6407,4.4372,0.8849,0.8568,0.7187,1.5028,0.0002,6.0506,5.0859,0.1622,2.6513,5.159,4.7105,1.7843,4.6304,5.1059,0.6629,2.7837,5.1152,0.4814,0.7854,0.6807,3.188,1.3214,1.6184,0.0036,0.4005,0.0268,1.2559,5.2792,4.9554,0.7966,3.7368,0.4896,4.681,1.3261,5.0342,0.0161,0.6312,2.019,2.4121,0.1771,0.022,3.2058,0.0013,4.9698,6.7774,0.132,1.7132,0.6092,2.6111,2.1153,4.8417,2.5992,3.4306,0.0602,3.1655,5.8055,0.0162,1.3425,4.0898,2.2302,0.0038,0.0018,1.6011,4.7293,3.1346,3.2576,1.0553,0.9634,0.0562,0.3786,2.6435,0.0004,1.0316,1.848,3.1054,0.271,1.6946,0.0024,0.6012,0.2686,0.71,0.2958,4.4936,1.6376,1.7973,0.1354,1.2628,1.7939,3.3073,3.851,2.4984,1.0823,1.1054,4.2047,4.6384,1.1491,0.0131,0.0043,0.0002,0.4413,0.4036,0.6254,4.3824,2.5987,4.975,2.3362,0.8741,0.0808,1.1031,1.9027,0.7067,0.0092,0.0933,4.8945,0.5448,4.3894,1.0306,2.2988,2.065,0.3157,6.4215,5.845,0.0011,4.6941,8.1844,2.1734,4.1375,1.8964,0.7889,0.0002,3.7375,4.7584,5.1108,4.849,0.0904,1.6566,4.7385,1.545,2.2107,3.2876,0.0625,0.1976,3.7922,4.7099,2.5134,2.9322,0.5839,1.0141,2.6148,0.0939,1.8165,5.4759,0.7672,0.2263,4.386,3.9585,0.0526,4.5081,2.47,4.1069,0.0002,5.4038,0.6099,0.0236,0.0032,1.7579,1.4756,4.2267,0.4546,2.8983,0.6531,0.0904,0.0078,0.0413,4.908,1.1161,1.8791,0.5776,3.2347,0.104]}
{"id":3578,"ended":false,"length":557,"gen_text":"Another focal point on the simmering tension between Indian and Sri Lankan governments is over the use of Kachchatheevu, an uninhabited island 15 km north of Rameswaram, belonging to Sri Lanka. The island is about one km in length and five km in width. The island has been inhabited for at least 6,000 years. It should be noted that the island was a sacred place to both Hindu and Buddhist communities until the recent violence that erupted after the LTTE fled to the island after coming to power in Sri Lanka.\n\nA group of about 10 people were waiting for a boat ferry to cross into Tamil Nadu for their wedding, after being stopped by police on the border in April this year.

The police said the couple, who were travelling with their two children aged 8 and 14, told them they were from Myanmar. They denied any connection to illegal entry into India\n\nOne of the people, Prasanna, said: \"They were shouting 'Bangalore bachao', 'Kachchati bhoolo' (We are Indians), when we told them they had to produce appropriate documents. They said they were from Myanmar. We asked if they had any documents and they said that if necessary, they will produce them.\"\n\nThe police on the island, however, said that they denied any involvement in the attack, which was in retaliation to a similar incident in India recently that occurred when the mother of an 11 year-old girl was raped at a camp for displaced people by smugglers over a fortnight. The woman was allegedly gang-raped by one of the children of the smugglers.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government has been fighting for over twenty years to have the island transferred to them.\n\nOn March 23, in the second ever major border clash between India and India over the disputed island, two soldiers lost their lives when their vehicle was hit by a missile near the disputed island in the sea between the Nellore district of India's Tamil Nadu state and the Idukki district of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe incident occurred after the Indian Army had warned that it would retaliate to any provocation in

{"id":2955,"ended":false,"length":586,"gen_text":"`` Vincent and the Doctor `` was nominated for the Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation in the 2010 Nebula Awards and the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ). Other honors include Hugo, Bram Stoker, CineFex, and BAFTA awards for other works; the BFI Award for Best Dramatic Presentation for `` The Man Who Fell to Earth `', and the British Academy Television Award.\nWith this book, you have all the elements and techniques of horror.\nThe book is a very good, well structured reference for beginning science fiction fans. The book is organized around five main sections. The first sections are the basic facts and techniques. Everything you need to know about writing science fiction is included in this first section, with a brief explanation on what a ``character is'' and how they behave. For the more experienced scribe, the book covers the various forms of horror in fiction (as opposed to the use of horror in art and film). The next section describes the three most common writing styles: short stories, novellas, and short stories plus novellas. These sections cover what each style requires in terms of dialogue and the character development. The final section is dedicated to horror themes and how you can use them when writing your very own science fiction. The last section delves into various practical issues: setting, characters (with suggestions on how to build them), and setting (including where to get money). These sections are a bit heavy on the technical side; if you are a beginner author, you might want to skip the section on characters and setting -- that section will help you get to know your plot and ideas better.\u00a0\nIn summary, this is a very good book for anybody who writes science fiction. The only thing I would add for the beginning writer is to read the stories first. Don't worry about what the actual plot is and focus on what is important to the story -- that may save a lot of time down the road.\n2. I was going to include a photo of this book, but with the addition of the book's cover art, that will have to do.\nThis book includes some great photographs. Some are self-portraits, the rest include interviews and images that have been seen or heard. The self-portraits are very well thought-out, including subtle aspects of their personality. That is certainly the intention with each photograph -- you are just being asked to picture something, not make an impression on the viewer. For more than 30 years, I have collected these photos and, although I have found some to be rather creepy, I have felt that they were important in helping me understand my fellow humans on earth -- that is, of course, what the photos are showing. The interviews show a very particular view of the human mind, perhaps even an odd way of seeing humanity.

{"id":54,"ended":false,"length":447,"gen_text":"Reactions of sulfur ylides with ketones and aldehydes to form epoxides are by far the most common application of the Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction. Examples involving complex substrates and'exotic'compounds are shown in the example below.\n\nHere, sulfur ylides are reactively formed by reacting ketone with aldekel and\/or a cycloalkenyl ylide as shown in the following diagram.\n\nAlthough these reactions are important for understanding the reactions and their product(s), they are only one part of what is necessary to prepare methylamine-isomer.\n\nA second, and possibly more important, step in synthesis is reaction of methylamine and acetaldehyde with an organic base (usually H 2 O) with an alcohol as discussed earlier. If any one of the two reactions fail, a large percentage of the methylamine is lost in the formation of acetic anhydride. The use of the ethers is a useful tool in the preparation of methylamine-containing compounds and the use of a mixture of acetic anhydride and ethers in the preparation of the amine can also be carried out to give further methylamine-containing compounds such as methylamine-containing ketones.\n\nNote that the reaction of methylamine and acetaldehyde with H 2 (tetrahydrofuran) is the simplest and most commonly used reaction in the preparation of methylamine-containing compounds due to the high reaction efficiency of this reaction. In this reaction the methylamine is reacted with a base (either H 2 or a reduced form of H) in the presence of an H group. The reaction then proceeds via the addition of sulfur and NH 4 Cl, as noted earlier, but with an additional step involving a reduction of the NH 3 to NH 2.\n\nMethylamine is reacted in an extremely efficient way in this reaction to produce the desired product, the nitrosyl moiety of the ketone (see below).\n\nThe reaction of methylamine with hydrogen peroxide is an excellent method for the synthesis of some methylamine derivatives:\n\nMethylamine\n\nA third important reaction used in the synthesis of methylamine-containing compounds is the reaction of methylamine with hydrogen peroxide (or ammonia). The reaction proceeds along with the formation of nitrosyl species, which are further oxidized to N-phenyl acetaldehyde through electron reduction. N-phenyl, methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl dienyl sulfide and the corresponding products can also be found in large products when N-phenyl, methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl dienyl sulfide and the corresponding methylamine-containing compounds are considered.

{"id":3062,"ended":true,"length":557,"gen_text":"The ships'belt armor was designed to defeat 380 mm shells at ranges over 16 @, @ 000 m ( 52 @, @ 000 ft ), and was inclined at 11\u00b0'to 12\u00b0 in the center to provide the ship with better protection against shells falling around in the lower half of the ship. Its thickness was estimated to be 1 to 2cm at the center and 1 to 3m on the sides.\nWith this armor the ships could not withstand shots and shells of any calibers up to 8.6 km\/s at close ranges. However, it could withstand penetration up to 6.7 km\/s ( 9.7 @, @ 000 ft ) at very close ranges with 8.5cm\/38 Mark 2.\nBy 1945, the ships of the'belt armor were significantly more than 40% less effective against medium caliber shells at the same ranges, which makes some sense when considering that they were intended to use them for mediums guns and weren't meant to shoot anything larger than 14 cm. They were also much less effective against 14 cm high explosive shells.\nHowever, with the introduction of 2 cm projectile in 1943, the armor of the ships was not as effective as it had been, and after the war they were largely abandoned. From January 1944 on, they were mainly replaced by the 1-inch belt armor which was already in service with the Type 1-1 and later Type 1-2 battleships. These two type of armor had similar thickness and angles on both the ships and the belt armor belt was extended. The two ship types had similar characteristics, but the Type 1 ships were able to reach a length of 50 m (164') longer (45 m - 51,9') hull by taking advantage of this extra space and their longer length. On average, they had a better armor protection, which in the long run was used against shells up to 4.68 km\/s ( 7.7 @, @ 000 ft ).\nThe hull armor was designed to resist rounds of 3 inch caliber up to 13,2 yd\/10.2 m, while the upper plates could be used against rounds of over 13,5 yd\/10.0m ( 15,8 yd \/12.0m) with some thickness loss.\nFinally, you can find the full page of this report with a detailed comparison of modern warship armor protection by going here. Please remember that a good armor protection is absolutely not the only thing that is necessary for a ship to survive a war, but only one of quite, many things. For some warships it is completely unnecessary to use an effective armor protection. What does a hull plate mean that won't really harm a boat, while a full armor protection might be able to take a very heavy shell, like a 10-man torpedo, from a depth of 16 nautical miles, and it also provides the crew with some protection for a short time? Also, how effective does a ship armor protection have against a machine gun of a maximum destructive force? The answer for both of these questions is very, very high.","token_len":626,"entropy":[10.2535,3.2343,18.1244,5.9261,2.0169,2.8881,0.439,6.5468,12.2083,2.013,0.726,1.895,2.5082,5.134,5.7648,15.423,7.9992,8.3616,9.8702,2.6054,2.9603,12.5304,5.1059,0.3414,0.6667,0.6959,4.6094,2.329,1.4677,2.8417,9.1677,1.1245,5.7194,1.4135,9.3257,3.7394,5.4633,0.0319,5.3307,1.2935,3.6474,3.608,2.878,2.7376,1.9373,0.4473,3.3782,1.7573,0.7207,2.7744,3.9721,5.2383,4.9296,0.4345,5.3036,2.664,0.0668,0.1357,1.082,0.4939,4.9871,1.722,0.6913,3.9899,0.9376,0.0775,3.0287,5.5077,0.965,4.6453,2.1458,0.7994,2.6035,1.1406,1.6933,0.4857,1.1521,6.3941,3.9761,0.568,0.5499,0.7712,1.804,8.4445,3.0831,1.4262,2.0014,1.9054,1.9012,3.2793,1.6856,5.7691,6.2101,1.2817,1.91,4.5167,3.4,0.4766,2.3955,0.0195,3.6703,1.5645,3.3861,4.4072,1.4405,0.374,2.8616,3.8636,1.2844,1.0574,2.9355,0.2012,2.4749,1.6758,1.0062,5.7251,2.2933,0.0047,3.2444,0.2516,2.1149,0.2635,0.0129,0.0022,3.5695,4.0149,0.2398,2.4572,2.3359,0.2736,0.0663,0.4914,0.8365,0.7585,0.9771,3.9223,0.6778,0.3009,4.627,3.9859,0.2626,3.1256,2.3127,2.7593,1.8424,4.8954,2.3454,4.0962,1.3442,5.6367,3.5661,1.0536,0.8843,2.4493,3.1688,0.3011,11.5131,8.609,0.4228,1.5496,5.204,2.4593,4.3905,5.1535,0.6485,2.7502,1.6989,0.7163,5.1668,0.8188,1.5236,2.3769,3.8658,1.6049,0.4591,2.1147,3.1242,4.5655,5.5255,1.4868,2.6393,2.1122,0.6987,2.7211,0.5214,4.3265,0.3212,5.4999,2.5917,2.3397,5.6112,5.382,3.8352,2.3627,5.8742,0.0029,2.2392,0.2064,4.0607,2.8671,2.6375,0.3636,5.2598,1.3177,1.779,4.4671,0.9018,1.1459,2.3143,0.8417,0.3482,0.2457,3.9242,0.7299,4.6336,2.0014,0.309,1.785,0.6027,3.3504,0.0593,3.8694,0.5859,0.7279,0.0121,5.7319,2.0949,4.672,3.5647,3.0338,0.3747,0.7522,2.7008,1.9426,0.3631,1.0684,1.2215,3.8884,2.2242,0.6642,1.2835,0.7611,2.1155,0.0994,2.3792,0.8442,4.2795,0.8383,3.2236,1.9363,0.5893,4.2121,2.9427,0.9446,6.0741,4.5423,1.4165,2.1151,0.3864,2.2593,0.3248,3.4609,4.455,0.3406,1.4792,4.6159,2.734,1.7862,1.9717,0.1205,3.4124,0.7667,5.3948,1.5469,1.1497,2.7039,0.9097,5.2479,3.2286,3.3123,3.3842,2.0851,4.4356,1.3758,0.7281,0.1083,0.6091,3.2692,0.0272,0.3806,4.7892,4.4361,5.821,0.5232,0.6645,2.8639,2.8891,1.2863,1.6978,4.6073,4.5716,2.5035,1.7893,5.5366,1.0446,1.0221,0.8966,1.0706,6.9466,1.8446,5.1864,4.7401,1.8913,5.61,4.9577,1.5278,2.2575,1.6951,4.7747,1.4646,1.0365,0.788,1.1458,0.3055,3.8595,0.9155,4.7855,0.0044,5.0819,1.2868,5.8036,0.1055,4.9766,3.1033,1.2815,0.4382,3.7794,2.4539,3.3229,5.2571,1.2982,5.2591,4.9502,4.6252,3.1274,1.3948,6.7744,6.4132,5.6197,0.6861,0.0204,3.117,2.5025,1.7048,2.4497,3.7363,2.6146,4.0137,1.1,4.5936,4.2836,0.4816,2.0147,1.6465,0.8653,4.8106,2.0838,0.9172,2.132,3.2852,4.4372,1.8507,3.0352,0.2866,1.7754,5.2962,2.7665,4.2705,2.4114,0.0084,3.578,0.2944,7.0958,0.3292,0.0159,0.0048,0.6187,2.1198,0.1085,3.2999,0.3433,0.0204,0.0106,0.1014,0.0675,0.6976,0.7234,1.42,5.7986,1.4045,1.4181,2.1453,0.3434,1.311,4.4649,1.4582,3.9539,3.3634,1.5336,1.6792,0.0064,3.8367,1.3572,2.7402,7.1936,0.0996,1.8602,3.5651,1.7619,2.2261,0.1167,2.4171,2.3375,0.4764,3.0748,5.0263,3.0881,2.4746,2.8067,1.3465,1.5675,0.6472,6.5317,1.2496,0.2616,2.0864,0.1034,0.0029,0.2141,0.5348,0.1088,4.6337,2.0831,2.0858,3.3403,1.2228,2.7089,0.313,0.0028,3.7652,5.2138,0.1972,2.0239,0.7569,1.6065,3.0938,3.2306,4.4493,0.8538,0.7027,1.4766,6.1508,0.09,6.0634,1.1391,1.9941,1.5366,4.335,5.1222,1.188,3.1993,3.9092,2.9751,2.5601,3.2325,3.7647,0.658,6.11,6.0569,0.0189,0.9675,2.3693,4.1344,5.6632,1.1237,1.6338,6.3986,3.4236,0.3373,4.7878,3.7413,2.0611,0.6347,0.8736,5.5113,2.6529,1.6652,2.1261,1.3535,0.7385,3.2044,3.2512,1.5157,0.3731,0.7998,0.2499,0.9388,0.9911,3.0885,1.3852,1.3196,4.2569,1.1434,0.2192,8.4257,8.0182,1.913,1.5258,0.692,3.7426,4.5801,4.5459,2.4955,0.9966,5.384,2.0136,2.6349,3.1716,3.4942,2.5917,0.2061,0.2781,2.1858,5.7176,4.3643,2.3646,6.1673,2.5535,3.9552,4.9874,4.438,0.0044,5.9425,5.043,2.2376,4.2581,2.2057,4.0764,1.251,4.5791,3.2097,1.0625,2.8953,2.0968,4.8189,0.0097,3.7932,0.9046,4.9119,1.9518,1.0368,2.8484,4.0191,0.6046,4.1802,2.0646,6.5128,1.869,1.4138,4.1654,1.2649,4.2138,0.105,5.1307,5.6934,0.2447,0.0344,2.4163,2.6189,3.1538,4.3638,4.0104,2.5598,2.1237,0.5185,1.4386,0.1625,4.5023,2.6256,1.5553,0.4835,1.9426,4.5466,0.3255,4.7369,2.7459,3.7603,1.1251,1.8425,3.4822,0.3399,1.2206,3.7317,1.3295,5.4571,0.1547,4.748,1.6905,5.4332,6.7477,4.0426,2.3708,3.14,1.1868,4.4176,2.4982,1.1743,0.3309,0.118,0.5822,3.3414,2.7925,0.0673,4.3912,0.763]}
{"id":949,"ended":false,"length":565,"gen_text":"Federer was born at the Basel Cantonal Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. His father, Robert Federer, is Swiss, from < unk >, near the borders between Switzerland, Austria and Germany < iks > in the south of those lands...<\/ iks >\n\nThe Federer family is extremely involved in the country's national soccer team, the Swiss national soccer team, as well as the national football team, the Swiss national football team. This involvement goes back to his father Robert Federer.\n\nHe attended the local high school in Lausanne, Switzerland and it is interesting to mention that he actually won the youth tennis cup of Lausanne, Switzerland in 1976 with the Swiss national youth team.\n\nIn 1981, Federer attended the Lausanne High School of Medicine, followed by the University of Basel's medical school. Despite being extremely good at tennis and being highly thought of as a possible future tennis prodigy, his parents decided against taking him and his siblings to the tennis court, as there was so much drama surrounding the youngster's youth at the time.\n\nAt 14 years old, he found out that he had a rare bone cancer. Despite all the doctors and specialists telling him to not bother about the diagnosis, his parents did not listen to them. Federer started the rehabilitation to give him the best chance of survival which turned out to be success. He had surgery on May 23, 1984 where he was given a titanium plate surgically attached to his right foot. He got the same treatment over a two days.\n\nIn 1987 as he had lost all feeling in his left foot, it was discovered that he had a tumour in his right foot (called peroneal neuropathy). That left him with numbness on both feet, as well as a lot of pain at the foot. He found the foot very painful which was difficult for him to play with. Although, he took up tennis again in 1988, he felt that playing with the foot was difficult for him. After several months, however, he finally went to the foot specialist, who put a bone graft in place which could be used in the future; at present it was successful until 2001.\n\nFederer took up professional tennis in 1989, and was seen with some problems during his rookie year, but managed to win some matches in 1991. The next year he won one of the first major titles for a Swiss professional tennis player: the 1989 U.S Open \u2013 beating the great Federer, John McEnroe.\n\nFrom 1992 onwards, Federer's injuries kept coming. In 1994, his left knee needed a complete reconstruction and he then broke his foot once again. Federer would never be the same again, but he remained competitive throughout the remainder of the 90s.\n\nFederer's career ended when he announced his retirement on November 22, 2001 after losing the match against Murray in the U.S. Open final. He had finished with the highest career earnings in tennis history - $9,742,976.\n\nReferences \u2013","token_len":626,"entropy":[5.314,3.4725,5.2085,4.4805,1.6656,7.3708,0.2605,6.3162,0.9646,0.3806,0.8037,1.5881,0.0069,0.5088,0.0283,1.5117,1.3461,1.0309,0.842,4.3847,4.6961,0.0006,0.1064,1.6285,4.0058,1.2669,6.2127,12.0019,10.6073,2.8774,0.9526,4.6008,3.1646,3.6779,5.4139,3.4015,0.9928,2.1099,2.7271,0.3385,0.7227,4.3587,6.6745,5.7144,0.1821,4.4943,0.3893,3.0592,0.4442,5.7338,6.6514,6.9571,2.6695,0.8519,0.0273,0.0251,2.8375,0.0183,3.6424,2.7594,0.0143,0.4668,2.3234,5.4086,4.4128,0.1978,1.1264,5.9431,1.102,5.1448,1.9192,0.2138,0.8762,1.4229,1.0777,0.702,1.5651,0.0532,1.0544,2.7037,0.3779,0.0581,1.1212,1.3886,1.8861,0.127,1.1633,0.4824,0.6067,0.2378,0.167,0.0092,0.3373,4.6333,4.427,3.9581,0.4611,0.3299,2.8725,0.591,2.6186,0.9776,0.0009,2.5136,1.3489,0.0002,3.216,3.665,0.788,3.7649,3.6244,0.0207,1.1646,3.8594,0.017,0.0057,0.5469,0.3774,2.3771,5.0553,1.0793,4.8654,0.2198,4.052,0.1608,1.2713,5.3844,3.3013,0.8552,4.4486,3.8956,5.3775,3.3513,1.1599,0.0003,0.0002,1.6226,0.9418,1.3827,4.8564,3.5373,1.2085,1.3942,0.8088,2.1242,0.2556,0.6049,0.9233,0.0001,2.4843,3.676,0.351,1.5289,0.001,3.7205,0.295,4.5059,0.0011,0.0001,3.4773,0.0581,2.5671,3.8597,1.3436,5.5863,0.104,0.6561,1.1147,0.0869,1.9232,0.0026,3.8577,1.4301,0.0845,1.0318,6.3976,1.8765,5.3182,3.7116,1.1621,0.4724,2.5332,2.3487,4.1981,6.167,0.0801,2.9977,0.2277,5.324,0.4952,1.8399,2.7466,0.0571,0.1006,3.2512,2.739,1.6202,2.1432,3.4541,0.1761,5.8309,0.7931,3.7796,0.1581,1.1267,3.987,3.7595,2.259,1.5202,4.2187,0.7924,5.0602,0.1788,5.1388,2.0658,1.6792,4.9867,1.5508,5.3147,3.7885,1.1145,0.3674,0.3708,0.6141,0.0002,3.6624,5.9604,0.6649,0.5213,0.1068,1.5833,5.8355,1.9124,0.5692,0.4888,0.8634,1.197,1.5915,4.1765,2.457,2.004,4.2148,2.9325,0.9788,3.1407,1.6876,1.5134,2.1551,0.101,2.3695,3.7839,4.3783,3.6188,1.6994,4.3935,0.5288,3.1578,0.7908,2.8772,0.2662,1.0308,0.6985,0.8477,0.8534,1.9255,0.0007,4.211,3.8934,5.6899,4.7848,4.812,0.7423,1.3093,0.3076,0.4478,0.8272,1.4285,7.5631,4.817,0.0986,0.0709,0.0259,6.4193,0.3741,2.1839,3.2353,2.5273,1.6615,4.0178,3.4079,0.2832,1.7452,4.4579,0.7031,1.2927,1.2287,0.9083,5.1035,0.5539,5.4816,0.0022,3.5557,0.1311,0.2305,1.7465,2.9539,0.8115,2.0041,5.4267,1.9242,4.363,1.8372,5.607,1.5615,3.2543,5.7409,1.9413,0.806,0.0002,2.2266,2.7575,7.8233,1.7002,3.1467,4.633,2.1155,1.719,0.2171,0.1238,1.9401,0.8856,0.3704,3.7407,0.3429,3.5322,0.0996,0.9163,0.3428,0.9639,4.2906,0.0123,0.7946,0.1955,0.7981,0.5153,4.407,4.3588,5.4777,0.6864,0.1654,1.0273,0.1069,0.7177,5.3276,4.6289,0.3871,0.8368,4.2797,0.0228,2.5441,2.4482,0.3708,1.6482,3.3234,0.0715,0.0135,2.2063,3.9954,0.0134,0.4811,4.8955,0.7383,2.8564,0.5614,1.6893,5.9578,3.0156,3.9389,3.6673,0.4267,4.8601,2.0533,3.8874,1.6368,0.0695,0.0528,2.7893,2.5696,0.4991,5.6261,3.1448,0.7715,5.6715,3.0499,1.1152,0.9026,1.3901,0.7582,0.5902,1.0255,4.9513,1.1084,3.7859,2.5561,1.2896,1.2908,0.8577,4.0438,1.8825,0.0948,0.7644,4.058,3.4354,1.0703,1.0698,4.3852,0.0197,0.5163,3.9277,4.6868,1.2188,1.1917,2.3545,0.6731,1.8216,1.0376,5.2921,1.744,4.0812,0.61,1.205,1.7381,3.4296,5.0325,1.8853,1.6501,2.5651,1.1108,0.5559,7.004,4.7479,5.5134,2.68,3.908,5.4904,7.7301,4.7968,0.3074,0.3384,0.0002,1.9596,0.0004,5.0769,0.5177,4.0944,0.0523,0.7621,1.9358,1.2681,2.0083,3.1324,5.5857,5.5126,3.506,2.0394,2.886,0.5935,4.6906,0.9292,1.6492,1.2693,2.684,0.0179,3.2684,4.141,2.0935,2.8932,3.0618,1.0481,3.1004,1.9029,0.2961,1.3425,0.8796,5.9041,0.5662,0.3069,2.7379,2.4811,0.9419,2.9384,1.0974,0.3353,3.6723,0.7726,0.0193,3.0306,0.2213,5.6759,2.4941,0.1643,0.0216,2.7324,6.9819,3.3103,2.1386,1.6007,4.8738,0.0415,2.1949,3.2674,0.0462,0.0001,0.0,1.1769,1.1312,0.0002,3.6539,1.5999,2.1344,0.2889,0.7477,0.0009,2.6653,4.7852,4.2178,2.0918,1.5739,1.6979,1.6677,0.5082,2.9434,1.5864,2.4118,5.6082,2.4322,3.4969,1.327,2.0447,1.1735,5.8383,3.3276,0.2941,3.3975,5.5474,0.1997,0.7305,3.0727,0.0009,4.0926,3.2063,2.1417,0.3212,0.019,1.0324,1.7851,2.0728,0.9585,4.1692,3.6968,3.3926,1.1123,3.041,0.003,2.4409,2.9472,0.6999,0.9497,0.907,0.0002,2.143,0.001,1.7468,2.2455,3.2522,3.2686,0.1037,4.2474,0.5413,0.0278,2.3473,3.0389,3.4451,0.0769,1.4739,2.544,2.2562,1.9666,4.7074,0.4083,5.2017,0.7533,0.1653,3.6024,0.0014,0.0032,0.1286,0.0176,0.5824,0.4352,1.4121,1.859,5.6498,1.6131,3.0015,1.4283,1.6938,1.1076,1.9241,0.6287,0.4813,5.7013,0.5512,4.2234,1.1171,3.4764,3.3961,0.013,3.1808,3.7914,0.5864,0.9922,0.0002,6.1033,6.9067]}
{"id":198,"ended":true,"length":581,"gen_text":"Anderson only attended film school for two days, preferring to learn the craft by watching films by the filmmakers he liked, as well as watching films accompanied by director's audio commentary.\n\n\nAnderson has described his films as \" Cinephile movies \".\n\n\nWhile he did have a short stint as a professional dancer, Anderson has denied that he has ever had a \" Dance With Me \" tattoo on his forearm.\n\n\nWith Anderson was his partner Ingrid Bergman and their daughter Juliette.\n\n\nIn 1986, he made four movies together with Lars von Trier, but he left the director's chair after being dissatisfied with the new material.\n\n\nAnderson was one of the first British films to be made for the then nascent United States Video chain ; this allowed him to be an early supporter of the VHS format and to see more shows being televised in the UK in the US than some overseas markets.\n\n\nIn a rare interview during the 1970s era and the 1980s, Anderson talked of being inspired by the work of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki ; some of the films he discussed with Miyazaki were Ghibli's Miyazaki-directed The Castle of Cagliostro, and Anderson's own short film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (1978). On being asked about these films, Miyazaki reportedly declared, \" Anderson is a great filmmaker and now there's no reason for me to put his name on anything.\" The filmmaker and Miyazaki remained professional friends for several years and had a few more films made together, though never with Anderson, and never after 1979 when Miyazaki returned to Japan to study animation at Tokyo University.\n\n\nIn an interview in 2007, Anderson said, \" I was the least interested in becoming a mainstream director in Hollywood when I began making films. I realized I wasn't going to have the influence I thought I would, and that if I didn't go out there and make a documentary about my experiences that those stories would just go by over and over. The only thing that interests me now is making good short films that are interesting to people who might have no idea who I am.\"\n\n\nAccording to Anderson, he felt \" It's so ironic when the big companies are saying they're going to make more movies with original ideas, and yet you're not going to see my name on anything. If I had one desire in life, it would be that I think of a good short film. If it's interesting to somebody, if it doesn't take up a lot of time, and if it has an audience that will pay to see it, then I'm happy \".

{"id":1301,"ended":true,"length":591,"gen_text":"In April 2010, Cantrell revealed to MTV News that Alice in Chains was contemplating making a fifth studio album in the foreseeable future. He explained, `` There are thoughts. We 'll see where it goes. If the reaction to [ the first three albums] is great, yes, we'll make another one. But I never say never. We've never done a record where we could go and make another one with anybody. We really like our band [ and ] so [ we ] have to see where this goes, and we have to have enough support to make that happen. But we're not going to commit to being a five-band reunion, or anything like that. We don't have a formula or a plan for where we are. If we did, the fans would know pretty quickly. We love the band. We still do, and it's a great group of musicians.''\n\nHe was less forthcoming in February 2010, telling Los Angeles radio station KNX 1070 that he was surprised that everyone, including Alice in Chains guitarist Kerry King, had been asking about a fifth studio album for so long.\n\nAfter making the rounds in the press in late 2009, on November 14, 2010, David Ehrlich revealed to Rolling Stone that he was working on an album with Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley. When asked if he'd be working on an album with Alice in Chains, he said, \"That's just rumors. If I don't do it, nobody is going to do it. [ It's] stuff that people have said for as long as I can remember that I just don't get excited about. And it's not because of anybody. If we did it, it would be a different song. It wouldn't be our style, it wouldn't be our sound. It wouldn't fit the style of the music we've written.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich is the executive producer of the CBS Television movie Alice in Chains: Dead End Street.\n\nMasters of Reality premiered in September 2011 on PBS. It focused on the late Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley, who died in 2002. The story followed the efforts of Layne's mother and stepfather, the late Sharon and Mike Dunlap, to make sure their son's name is kept in metal, not rock history. He said Layne's mother has had trouble convincing the world that Layne is actually the band's primary songwriter. Layne's father, Mike, is a former member of Alice in Chains. As she spoke about writing and her son, Sharon Dunlap, a high school classmate, appeared to be struggling with Layne. She said it took Layne three passes to learn how to play the guitar. Sharon said she wanted to get the story to a younger generation. She asked, \"So why not make it a big deal?

It is in our society's insistence that a person's identity is constructed by their job and by the work they do. The work ethic that we think is inherent in our people is, in fact, just an excuse for the fact that people work long hours at low wages.\n\nIt is time to call a halt to workplace abuse. Today, the time isn't far off. The work ethic has reached its apex, and we are in danger of losing a generation of people who cannot work or have lost the will and the skills to work if the world we are living in continues to allow this abuse to continue.\n\nWhen we realize that workplace abuse is caused, first and foremost, by a culture that requires workers to work long hours at low wages then we must work together to prevent

{"id":1592,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"A tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September 5, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of low pressure has developed in the Atlantic since early yesterday, and the system has been gathering strength in the lower half of the Atlantic Basin, although it has not actually moved to the east coast of the United States. An area of low pressure is currently over the Caribbean Sea, and should move north and east of the Caribbean Sea this week, and will eventually cross the United States on Friday morning.The most interesting development is the current track of the system. The most likely scenario has the system forming in the eastern Atlantic and then travelling north on a path through central Great Britain. If it did this the system would likely hit Great Britain on Friday morning, with the most probable track along the eastern coast, however with the current weather pattern this would most likely be after 9:00am EST. Also it would probably stall offshore of Great Britain, with some mild convection along the north coast. It would remain just south of the coast through Friday afternoon and Saturday.The most likely pattern of development is this. A ridge of low pressure in the Atlantic develops over the last two days, and by early next week enters the central Gulf of Mexico where it will track over the eastern Gulf of Mexico which will then extend into the eastern Caribbean Sea on Thursday. As a result, the lower pressure system will then combine with an associated area of low pressure on Thursday and Saturday into a multi-cell low, which can then move up the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend, with widespread winds and heavy rain across most of eastern Mexico, the south coast of Cuba and the Virgin Islands and also the Bahamas. This will continue through next Tuesday as the system becomes a tropical storm at the beginning of the weekend.The current system will likely stall off the Gulf of Mexico this weekend, where it will begin to weaken before moving to the eastern United States through the end of next week. In the coming weekend, it should be moving over warmer waters in the eastern Caribbean Sea, but any chance of its rapid strengthening in the next few days will be greatly reduced until the next weekend.A few more things to know about the storm:It will have tropical storm force winds over the next 24 hours, and some possible tropical storm force winds late next week. That is the most likely track for the system, though it is likely the system's track will likely change as I continue writing this article over the next several days. A tropical storm with sustained, storm-force winds would likely cause widespread power outages from Mexico to northern Florida and then out to Florida and eastern South Carolina. It would be a significant weather event to the east and near the coast of the Atlantic Seaboard, all the way to New England, the Carolinas, and eastern Canada.

{"id":713,"ended":true,"length":589,"gen_text":"The results of the expanded offerings did not contribute well to the series, alongside the late @ - @ 2000s recession ; sales of most rhythm games including Guitar Hero and DJ Hero did not pick up much in the wake of similar trends in the mobile and browser market, and none of the games mentioned here have been translated outside of Japan to the West.\n\nThere is one new Rhythm Heaven game on the West, though. Rhythm Heaven Megamix [official site] [Free] was released just over three years ago on the Wii, and has gone on to become a critical favourite, and is now finally available on the West. The first new rhythm game in over three years, this follows the core gameplay formula of Rhythm Heaven and has since gained multiple sequels with a spin-off of sorts, including one on the DS.\n\nYou still play a rhythm while a series of music blocks appear, some with different patterns than others, which must be unlocked together or separately. The new Rhythm Heaven Megamix, released to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Rhythm Heaven, adds new songs and content.\n\nAs with other rhythm games, the main goal of the game is simply to beat the opponent to the beat. However, instead of being blocked against the wall, the music blocks now attempt to jump through the gaps to give themselves greater height, making it difficult for the rest of the team to chase them.\n\nThe song list is mostly similar to the original release and each song is played in the order you unlocked them, allowing you to start with a fresh new experience as you play. New items that can only be purchased with money and can only be used once per game are available to purchase from shop items, including bonus notes for the Megamix characters you're playing, as well as \"Wii Music\" and song-specific accessories which have varying effects.\n\nNew features have also been added such as online leaderboards, a difficulty selection function similar to that on Beatmania IIDX20, a new currency system, and the ability to choose which rhythm blocks you want to play as, alongside any other song that makes use of the blocks; this, it was revealed, allows one block to play the melody from three songs in turn.\n\nThe game can be downloaded again for free, but a purchase is required for all remaining content. Though this is more affordable than the 3DS version at just 2,826 yen, the 3DS version is likely to be more expensive as this is the first of several rhythm games on the eShop.\n\nAll in all it's a pretty solid rhythm game, though that's before we're considering the huge marketing campaign it managed to pull together behind the scenes, with the main character appearing on the cover of the game over a dozen times. It's good that they added the DLC that isn't just a repeat of the main game, which in turn gives it some longevity \u2013 but that doesn't make it the best, with that title going to Rhythm Heaven Megamix in our Game of the Year Awards \u2013 but it's very much a contender.","token_len":629,"entropy":[6.3869,1.3007,0.8329,9.9876,11.8018,7.0855,0.2667,8.4058,7.4572,0.0904,0.8738,7.3034,4.005,11.3341,1.1928,7.0188,12.2272,10.0373,6.6018,10.6052,5.3569,7.9072,10.1365,6.9692,1.9214,6.3608,12.2286,0.1795,6.5905,4.3729,0.1257,1.9689,8.7976,0.0084,4.2893,0.2267,4.0959,0.0305,2.7513,2.3808,0.61,3.3541,0.0266,6.6881,5.0626,0.8313,1.2034,4.9234,2.2469,3.1304,1.7293,1.9383,1.3236,5.9478,0.2178,0.2716,2.2374,4.9607,1.661,2.5532,1.7886,5.5793,2.4557,0.199,0.163,4.0432,2.8007,0.6534,0.3544,0.8961,0.0472,4.2974,1.7122,2.5528,5.3839,3.4803,0.8279,0.4743,2.7999,0.4343,5.0618,1.2388,3.1701,2.0777,1.6077,0.2353,0.0756,0.0002,0.0001,6.6529,1.3627,0.0287,0.8152,4.67,4.0213,0.8396,2.2736,0.8402,4.91,2.3503,3.6419,0.2461,0.2883,2.5469,1.2371,1.7136,2.3033,0.7086,2.6122,4.7738,0.3618,0.0131,1.4772,1.2516,5.04,3.3647,2.3782,2.7643,2.9353,1.7751,4.1301,1.6769,0.6997,1.1357,4.0771,0.9106,2.8239,4.3284,5.1793,1.4383,0.0839,1.5301,2.1613,3.15,0.0409,0.3317,3.651,5.1859,1.121,4.724,1.792,4.7422,0.625,2.7874,0.0652,1.9984,3.6666,4.7658,4.2731,6.4137,1.2386,4.4198,2.4247,4.3542,0.8727,0.0061,4.045,1.4505,1.4958,3.6189,3.309,2.3487,0.7515,2.2262,0.8575,1.1817,0.0002,4.7352,5.9433,1.4324,2.0703,1.9342,6.5459,2.3259,3.2867,0.0071,3.9084,4.7868,1.3054,1.5598,5.1572,2.755,2.3569,2.0506,3.4906,0.4108,1.0524,3.0559,3.7175,0.1699,4.2467,6.9827,3.4427,2.5476,0.5652,1.9265,5.1632,3.6163,0.2746,0.3258,0.0025,0.0001,4.2351,2.685,4.2969,2.0659,0.4053,3.6449,0.0273,0.0567,0.1519,1.9266,0.0143,0.4211,2.8908,2.1383,2.2157,1.2954,4.5509,2.9774,1.3889,0.0002,3.6916,1.9815,3.1897,0.7963,0.084,0.3798,1.8255,3.065,2.2594,1.8263,0.8393,0.3002,0.0426,4.4565,0.1054,2.5945,0.521,5.0503,2.9031,0.7113,0.4263,1.2581,2.4515,0.1131,3.4684,0.0073,2.9012,4.9116,5.4866,2.0998,3.1425,0.7674,1.0809,2.9187,0.5304,2.1538,5.5154,0.0153,4.8119,3.9408,0.9753,2.2114,3.5087,6.0657,1.7946,5.1252,1.0085,1.3843,3.003,1.2665,3.7243,1.5258,0.4293,7.2209,0.0352,0.116,3.0315,0.1711,4.9501,0.5375,1.4185,1.5551,0.0002,1.6613,5.1286,1.6279,1.2299,4.1051,3.8805,0.1128,0.8667,0.744,4.9343,3.7779,5.8034,1.4325,1.6368,3.4573,1.281,2.2963,1.2313,2.6852,1.7289,1.1257,1.0582,4.9434,0.7907,0.0515,4.3588,1.7809,1.8005,2.4223,3.6939,2.5568,4.7758,1.0997,1.652,1.1905,3.5764,5.2086,4.6074,1.6938,2.6746,0.0094,3.2106,1.1719,3.4851,2.9755,3.5919,1.7184,0.0165,1.4873,1.6677,1.4857,2.6274,1.0316,2.971,2.0755,1.6471,2.9859,4.948,2.7446,1.1107,3.0498,6.1894,4.735,2.2612,1.8048,5.736,0.5859,0.0011,5.8517,7.0434,3.8846,0.6866,2.9205,2.4692,0.0319,0.0124,5.2112,5.8573,3.7696,2.9865,0.9979,2.5208,6.0518,2.7624,1.6284,3.3425,4.1389,4.5236,4.5028,0.3614,0.8861,0.3711,0.0002,3.7305,2.6601,3.5962,1.0931,0.0905,0.2755,2.8701,0.0048,5.0939,0.9401,0.0714,0.8187,2.3519,5.3472,3.481,4.4064,5.2092,0.0055,1.5666,4.1512,5.1447,0.6028,0.8852,0.001,0.0004,5.4423,0.8958,2.436,2.6207,6.0249,1.8832,1.094,0.5867,1.9967,0.4171,0.0214,4.2343,2.5959,3.2043,3.7922,1.6214,1.1049,0.1354,1.1723,3.2701,1.9298,5.8925,5.8933,1.4332,4.2829,3.2765,6.4451,0.7208,0.0033,1.1212,1.5194,5.5975,1.9487,5.7126,3.9355,4.7124,2.9741,0.4054,2.6193,5.647,2.3466,0.1446,2.0837,2.7651,2.9704,3.6576,5.6823,1.6219,2.9541,5.6858,0.6764,0.3238,0.0002,1.8953,1.592,3.6451,0.4384,1.51,7.1888,0.9284,0.9025,1.8453,1.6044,3.529,3.1822,1.1291,0.5643,1.2736,2.4725,5.5418,1.5279,0.8291,5.9135,3.4799,1.3151,4.2929,6.2431,0.4717,1.2976,6.221,0.0216,1.1719,4.1427,3.7103,5.818,0.7221,5.2258,4.3074,0.3337,0.5129,1.5268,3.1662,0.0047,0.2723,1.3175,5.0729,0.6434,0.8663,2.2621,2.9732,2.5291,3.8451,1.0182,0.9451,1.3342,4.1982,3.4792,2.071,0.1666,2.6208,0.2372,3.6311,0.0027,1.1345,0.684,0.0002,5.3645,2.9083,0.0049,3.3205,0.3099,0.483,3.1587,1.5143,0.8334,0.0661,0.9587,1.8673,5.6597,2.5957,5.5337,1.5382,5.2865,2.8534,0.6169,5.4499,5.2866,1.3387,2.4932,5.4338,0.2903,2.1102,3.644,6.9376,0.6983,0.2393,2.2159,2.4127,1.8346,4.7628,2.4128,2.2392,1.4626,1.5704,0.5656,0.0426,2.2784,2.956,6.6228,1.8112,1.3353,0.128,0.8356,2.4066,0.6257,4.8207,2.3852,2.7655,4.985,2.2529,3.7574,4.6379,5.3358,0.0003,2.7008,1.4472,4.6127,0.0497,0.4076,2.138,0.3231,0.5323,3.8263,4.7409,1.8007,3.3366,2.3704,2.5851,1.8506,4.6687,2.5761,3.5914,2.7408,0.0003,1.6197,0.8947,2.7641,0.2646,4.0453,3.732,3.6321,1.5161,2.2553,0.5872,2.7348,0.2244,0.625,0.0009,0.0,3.6243,2.621,5.4811,0.1863,0.0543,0.0311,4.6253,5.3886,2.1868,0.8244,0.4006,5.6425,1.1852,1.2401,4.8066,0.8974]}

{"id":1491,"ended":false,"length":592,"gen_text":"Among the critics of McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like `` story understanding `` and `` understanding `` in a more `` scientific `` manner. But McCarthy was convinced that the scientific community did not have the discipline for working in problems like those he was trying to solve in the ``mathematical logic'' research group. `` '''\nWith this background, McCarthy could not explain why IBM was not more cooperative.\nHe went on to write, ``When IBM got involved, then it became easy. We could do this, that and the other. ``\nAs it turned out, IBM was very interested; one IBM scientist noted in 1964, `` `He [McCarthy] is very generous with our work, because we are not rich enough to pay him handsomely.''\nThe most important issue was the question of whether an objective formalism should be required for some important results. One MIT scientist said, ``I think there is a serious problem about the appropriateness of [a formal procedure ] for defining the logical concepts.''\nIn the spring of 1964, McCarthy and the other researchers wrote a ``synthetic a priori language'' for a new theorem that was to serve as a proof of the new ``proof theory theory'' approach, which was also introduced by McCarthy in 1963.\nThe problem was that the formalism seemed to have been ``invented'' for no specific purpose. ``The approach of `proofing by deductive reasoning'' was at the time viewed with suspicion by some mathematicians. The ``proof theory approach'' was proposed and proved by McCarthy as an alternative to that form of reasoning, and as a ``natural extension of his earlier work.''\nMcCarthy's formalisms did at least one good thing for the ``mathematical logic`` research group: they made it possible for McCarthy to find another job. At this time, one of McCarthy's colleagues said, `` I can almost guarantee that if McCarthy ever wrote a paper about proof theory, it was due to [him], for we could be sure he wouldn't tell anyone, because of the risks involved.''\nWhen IBM got the ``proof theory'' approach, it was too late for McCarthy to work there--he was forced out of MIT. He went on to found a computer research company called Computer Systems Research Corporation in 1970 and moved his wife and young family to Boston after 10 years there to start a new job -- working in Cambridge.\nBut by then he had already created an influential legacy for the ``mathematical logic'' research group that McCarthy and his colleagues had been building.\n``There was nothing really new about [McCarthy's] approach to mathematics--there really was a revolution, for a change, in the way the mathematical community responded to McCarthy's efforts.''\nA copy of McCarthy's ``A Synthetic A

{"id":3025,"ended":true,"length":593,"gen_text":"Bellaire's housing lots are 75 feet ( 23 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ), allowing for houses larger than those that could be built on typical 50 feet ( 15 m ) by 30 feet ( 9 m ) lots in Fort Worth. The lots need to be built in such a way as to accommodate an RV and to provide for the comfort, security, and ease of access of the occupants.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere are no rules and regulations regarding the parking.\n\n.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the size of the lots, or what can be built on them, or how many residents can live on a single lot. There are a variety of options for RV space on a lot, and as the lot is larger, the number of residents increases. Most residents are allowed to build additional buildings, although the rule is to have no more than 30 people on any lot.\n\n.\n\nWhat is your relationship with the city of Fort Worth?\n\nI have never had a problem here. We've been working together for about three years. They have been very good to us, and we're very happy with their assistance. This is not a small project.\n\nWe are also very good to them when they are trying to do things like put the streets properly paved.\n\nI have also worked for two different developers, and now there is an owner\/developer who is coming in to the project, and they had always done things the way we liked them done. The two developers had been very good to us. Now the owner\/developer will handle the management of the facility, and we will handle the development of the space.\n\nWhat has it been like working with the community?\n\nThis community has been nothing but helpful with us at my property. The first week in the new year was very cold for me, my wife and my two boys. All we managed to do was go under the covers, and sleep. They were cold. The first weekend, it was snowing and freezing when we got here, and it was extremely hot. My house has been quite a change over the past three years.\n\nThere's a lot of laughter happening. There's very few people that have never heard of Fort Worth. There's a lot of friends and family that we were able to get in touch with and give them a real look at living here. We have the community's blessing to make this happen now. The community is more than appreciative. They are very happy with who, where, and how it is doing, and this project needs to be done.\n\n.\n\nHow is community support?\n\nThe community has been very good. I have spoken to my neighbors and a very few other owners all over the entire property. They have also been there to help with the building and making sure it was going to be done right. They are more than willing to give the team, the community, and myself a better look at ways we can make the space the best it can possibly be. They have been very professional in their help.","token_len":633,"entropy":[8.8048,3.5223,7.7056,10.0006,1.3305,8.786,3.3928,5.546,8.3807,1.1085,0.5333,4.7281,4.8779,0.0125,0.0064,3.5465,0.0297,1.8123,6.0466,0.8866,6.7902,5.8254,0.0201,2.5797,3.139,3.9519,0.2566,0.2925,1.5458,5.8332,8.5994,5.0436,0.3683,0.2014,0.0423,0.0365,1.0603,3.9895,0.0307,0.0094,0.1917,0.0485,0.0199,0.168,1.2425,6.1722,0.5072,0.7445,1.9865,3.1561,6.1194,0.7557,0.1385,2.6753,2.3552,1.7789,0.03,0.09,2.0262,0.0431,3.4072,4.0129,5.3947,2.8015,3.5922,2.0414,2.8589,1.8884,5.2594,2.8044,2.5491,0.5508,0.3365,4.5418,0.0311,1.6162,0.7886,1.1787,1.3188,0.4682,1.3946,0.0126,7.198,1.5915,0.0001,3.5151,0.1209,0.0002,4.9893,0.4601,2.4498,3.5786,4.0876,0.1874,2.1101,1.0723,4.4857,4.2983,2.4705,0.0001,0.2811,0.0441,0.0001,3.5792,0.4844,0.4764,2.4028,0.6426,0.6901,1.6231,0.4007,0.9303,2.9104,1.5511,2.6094,4.2456,1.4638,0.1214,0.5379,0.2278,0.2771,2.5238,1.7511,1.7505,1.3768,4.1522,0.5876,0.3825,1.08,1.3793,1.6536,0.0625,0.1445,2.7927,0.3791,4.4331,2.6582,0.0038,2.918,1.1609,3.8479,4.7813,2.5654,2.3619,0.8854,1.0025,1.8529,4.513,2.5261,3.1022,1.4761,3.3975,0.7889,1.1473,1.6321,0.0353,1.3105,1.813,0.2892,5.0928,3.865,1.9545,2.5323,0.6279,3.267,5.4674,4.0029,2.6006,3.8369,1.8396,5.7538,1.0445,2.4089,2.0777,1.8403,0.0629,0.0316,4.5685,3.1465,1.3831,2.3537,0.8524,0.3486,0.8512,0.0002,0.128,0.0271,0.0001,6.1454,1.7842,4.7549,3.357,0.2175,0.5827,1.4761,0.811,0.5764,0.0021,0.4393,0.257,0.0001,3.4488,1.0772,3.0566,1.2432,0.9936,0.4339,5.6646,0.6558,3.1649,2.3677,1.8404,4.0916,1.1966,0.5431,2.9731,3.1215,0.1593,1.2153,2.9737,1.6263,1.286,0.7599,2.7455,0.4364,0.2209,1.8291,0.7483,1.2153,2.6286,1.2233,1.313,0.8819,2.7731,3.1515,0.3603,5.3258,0.7797,2.7981,0.9588,4.2951,2.6748,0.9767,1.3045,0.0002,4.4397,2.0898,4.1639,1.8986,4.2064,1.8741,2.6837,3.7867,0.9506,2.8756,3.109,0.0075,2.1491,2.1014,2.6129,4.432,3.1493,5.2474,6.5014,1.3643,1.0838,1.6455,0.0002,3.1634,1.8181,4.0652,2.836,3.2111,4.413,2.8455,4.5046,1.6151,0.6607,6.2741,4.8384,0.7063,2.6663,3.4945,3.0375,0.5208,0.0066,1.7612,0.842,3.8779,0.8324,1.4323,4.103,1.4352,2.1629,0.7776,1.7609,5.7526,5.5769,4.0199,2.0769,1.4686,0.9639,2.4497,5.2179,0.6145,1.7185,0.5296,3.643,5.8091,1.3828,1.9965,2.4823,1.174,0.8413,0.1568,0.1799,1.4028,3.4165,2.374,0.9095,0.5917,0.0053,0.0044,3.7534,6.2568,1.053,5.0157,0.7023,0.1815,5.3137,1.3181,0.5693,1.2878,0.5589,2.4119,0.2768,3.6404,1.5981,0.1326,5.29,0.2923,0.5101,0.0002,2.4313,3.5592,3.2546,0.0647,0.0032,1.3229,0.4136,0.8072,3.8709,0.652,0.1162,0.0001,3.8261,1.9312,0.6506,0.1875,4.9661,0.0623,1.9269,4.601,0.8763,5.266,7.3441,4.7425,0.2702,2.2366,4.0166,3.2775,3.8814,2.2631,2.4242,2.1118,3.2086,2.1856,3.3783,3.4108,2.4754,0.7441,5.0327,0.9612,0.9901,1.2684,2.407,3.0192,0.5908,4.8666,3.0335,6.8399,0.0484,0.576,0.1376,2.6111,6.9402,0.3931,4.5125,2.317,0.7416,3.2533,1.0812,3.4004,1.5954,3.6764,2.1343,2.323,2.893,3.9916,2.3407,2.8487,0.4428,3.2938,0.0381,2.2882,2.0575,5.4493,0.6083,1.5022,2.4586,1.3934,0.6413,1.9038,0.8861,5.1864,3.1596,0.8765,3.7373,4.7234,2.9445,2.1285,5.5669,1.2036,4.0608,4.6045,0.5607,1.8711,1.8317,0.262,0.3554,0.977,0.0002,3.4187,3.2591,1.0854,0.7264,0.1379,5.5943,6.4897,2.1364,1.7518,0.7436,5.1661,2.6136,1.4036,1.7747,2.3058,3.7824,3.2458,0.6787,3.3481,0.009,0.9571,2.4025,0.8811,0.8665,0.3626,0.0471,5.3461,1.346,0.8554,1.1063,3.0044,5.4311,0.9675,0.0018,1.689,2.788,1.8116,0.0066,3.2204,4.3439,0.885,0.9065,5.1634,3.2683,0.3957,5.5634,0.7166,0.2461,2.4556,1.9998,4.456,3.8588,2.7332,2.2702,1.3691,2.8889,0.5477,0.8348,6.2302,0.4223,3.6129,1.8858,1.2604,5.5316,0.5964,7.051,0.0066,1.0669,2.6705,1.5715,1.6697,2.107,1.9568,6.1095,7.3928,2.2907,0.5653,0.2058,0.7425,1.8562,0.9779,5.0278,2.741,0.1842,5.2157,2.9344,6.3694,0.436,1.5071,1.8839,0.7241,0.4383,0.0002,1.4419,0.0329,0.0002,2.2579,2.8099,5.693,2.1288,3.0266,0.1519,0.0001,1.5197,0.8256,0.6188,0.2485,0.8971,2.2498,1.818,2.5197,1.2718,4.6545,0.6851,4.0761,1.3312,1.4836,4.5344,5.9451,1.6849,3.6528,5.4035,7.2341,0.7103,0.5496,7.34,3.0738,0.4353,1.9133,1.3054,4.2836,0.7705,6.9926,1.4774,1.218,2.4112,1.6987,4.1776,2.5008,4.0215,0.6493,1.7799,3.1436,4.335,0.1017,0.3418,1.0067,0.9388,0.1786,2.1362,1.6012,4.2435,0.0587,1.3997,0.0478,2.8086,4.3015,5.7467,4.4809,1.2721,2.9434,0.1983,0.2643,1.3563,1.054,6.3543,1.473,0.4276,7.6945,1.4966,0.1707,0.9211,2.0757,2.5803,4.6516,0.2189,0.4034,0.0771,2.6329,0.0096,0.1612,2.7515,1.438,0.7576,0.4846,6.2607,2.3612,1.9772,4.4339,0.8176]}
{"id":4130,"ended":true,"length":523,"gen_text":"Passenger only `` stretched `` version of the 200 series, incorporating 123 inches ( 3 @. @ 1 m ) longer fuselage, capable of carrying up to 139 ( originally 99 ) passenger cars. The aircraft are currently capable to seats up to 1,600\n\nThe B-47 was designed as a high performance combat bomber. B-47-5E was designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, but with an entirely different design philosophy. B-47E was produced after the B-47-5.\n\nThe first B-47A variant, B-47E-1, was the prototype for the first production version : The B-47E-1 had four propellers, and the B-47E had eight propellers. B-47E was the first flight test model for the B-47E.\n\nThe B-47A model differed from the prototype in the following ways :\n\nFour large radome antennae were added to the fuselage. These radome antenna are placed to produce a high power antennae to reduce the radio noise, improving the performance of the aircraft.\n\nThe wingspan was increased by 8 feet and the wing area was increased by 7 %. These changes were made after the successful B-47D model was completed.\n\nThe wingspan, wingspan length and chord of the wing was set on the wing tips. This resulted in a drag drag, where the wing's area was not increased and drag had to increase by 6 %. The wing tip was moved in order to provide optimal position for the engines. This change was made due to problems encountered during heavy and extremely-heavy-weight aircraft.\n\nThe B-47, by its configuration, would not be able to operate from land bases in the US. Due to this, the B-47 was equipped with a drop tank in case of a landing on water (as in the case of Japan ). At this time the drop tank for the B-47 was a drop tank designed by the Boeing Company for the B-29 Superfortress, which were still produced during WW2. The drop tanks have a built-in water source. Water from this drop tank is then fed into the wings and propellers and used to help reduce drag during landing.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with drop tanks. The drop tanks for the B-47 could be filled by attaching special dispensers to the pontoons that had to be mounted. They had to be attached to the right of the drop tanks.\n\nThese drop tanks could be filled with water, or it could be dropped from a helicopter. The parachute system used on B-47 is one that would be used on the more famous B-52 and B-1 Spirit aircraft.\n\nThe drop tank for the B-47 could be filled with water or it could be dropped from helicopters.\n\nThe internal structure of the B-47 was much more rugged than the wings used on other aircraft used today and was also a major factor in keeping the aircraft flying. This is one of the aircraft that served in the World War II.","token_len":633,"entropy":[3.0849,8.3485,13.012,15.2473,3.3194,7.25,1.4029,0.6295,9.226,2.7098,2.6521,7.3305,12.2677,5.9391,2.2574,9.7771,12.2667,4.7408,6.084,5.5427,5.2462,1.2595,3.7827,4.1565,0.0058,1.6725,7.7962,0.0163,0.5711,2.2047,0.0086,8.3072,4.7471,12.0243,6.7274,0.3596,3.7028,2.2858,0.7689,1.513,3.5624,6.1975,5.0634,5.4699,3.9817,6.8935,2.1163,0.0134,4.7194,0.3915,4.0588,6.2406,0.0081,2.4098,4.6117,0.5897,2.5814,1.8484,2.7303,1.9012,0.3273,2.7935,2.2406,4.7382,1.4079,1.9516,4.7309,0.1014,0.051,4.0706,4.0338,5.8398,2.0449,3.3751,1.2821,0.4956,4.192,0.9876,1.4978,2.4838,3.8937,2.9525,5.3983,0.5976,2.7987,0.9368,0.5652,2.9106,0.0124,0.0132,3.3242,1.0486,5.4626,5.1057,0.808,1.3712,0.0082,0.0256,0.9583,0.8287,3.1462,1.5691,0.0004,1.2286,3.0214,1.5537,0.0082,0.0178,4.2242,4.6077,1.5834,1.8286,0.0102,0.0207,2.8455,1.7073,0.8087,0.4453,0.4951,2.9221,3.1652,0.92,0.2159,2.3119,0.8794,2.0558,9.5293,3.4273,0.6891,0.0085,0.0075,0.2233,0.5972,0.3025,2.6823,4.1155,4.5989,0.4299,1.4336,2.4615,2.2089,1.8912,0.0083,0.0085,0.0998,3.8613,3.56,1.1366,0.0132,0.2904,3.1087,0.0091,0.0082,0.1145,1.9783,2.0391,0.4266,4.926,2.0526,2.3529,2.8769,0.2498,1.0029,0.0173,0.0096,0.4569,2.2125,1.2994,0.0002,0.7886,0.8189,0.0077,0.0131,3.0222,5.2041,4.0476,0.5108,0.2372,3.5512,0.9845,1.6682,1.0775,1.2724,0.8105,0.6418,0.0002,5.7854,4.624,5.2488,0.5144,2.564,0.6017,0.9163,0.8429,0.688,0.1648,2.5602,0.0007,1.9222,3.1642,1.3481,1.1334,1.1028,4.8047,5.2708,4.3096,5.5483,0.9954,3.1327,3.7697,1.6079,1.3682,3.1797,4.1877,0.7705,3.9082,1.4191,3.3712,5.3548,0.5421,2.7676,0.342,0.156,0.698,0.4037,0.6738,0.0002,0.8921,3.372,1.7051,0.5443,0.6327,1.1471,3.3175,1.1668,3.1379,0.4749,2.306,0.6076,0.7586,0.2154,0.1762,3.4162,5.4847,0.4602,4.3814,0.6129,1.6465,1.1707,4.4989,0.8706,4.1261,1.6131,0.0177,0.1124,3.065,2.6205,1.8716,1.8691,0.4034,0.2536,0.0002,0.5445,3.3818,1.3384,4.4339,4.0696,0.1535,2.7256,0.5462,4.4421,1.7352,0.1076,3.3192,2.697,6.3316,5.1857,0.7996,4.7493,3.0204,1.2455,1.5913,3.3567,0.0503,0.8482,6.1159,7.3186,4.9249,4.7635,0.3628,1.2716,4.2455,2.8809,1.0313,4.0764,2.3908,3.6602,3.8668,5.2473,0.2593,4.3462,2.5759,4.737,1.1187,0.861,2.0999,1.5511,2.7613,2.0626,4.5465,4.2627,1.1438,0.0274,4.3249,6.7455,5.4557,0.5049,0.3502,3.9819,0.5538,2.4253,2.5124,1.1935,0.4921,3.8803,0.0177,4.6793,2.0355,1.5666,6.1988,5.1737,5.2917,5.9043,2.7392,2.3527,0.8305,3.4272,2.6423,0.3839,0.0002,0.5062,2.1612,0.0092,0.0062,5.5804,5.3604,2.4253,4.7574,0.2868,4.312,1.701,0.5187,0.9212,0.0125,3.6694,2.3324,4.5939,0.5298,3.7946,0.904,2.7377,1.0732,4.9386,0.0174,0.6609,0.7275,0.7465,0.887,0.0069,0.0042,1.3516,3.2458,0.0615,1.1912,4.1522,0.2855,2.5817,4.5282,0.4599,2.4229,1.2347,2.2962,0.8949,4.2112,4.799,3.0445,0.6818,0.733,0.0532,6.0983,3.6927,6.1191,2.0942,0.2345,2.2738,1.0722,0.3343,5.6991,0.3669,0.1565,0.0104,0.0082,0.5191,1.8925,4.0536,0.1293,4.2722,0.9089,1.4723,2.415,0.7622,2.7687,0.2915,0.7458,0.0177,1.2423,0.5564,0.0021,0.0034,2.3384,1.6018,3.7822,5.6777,5.1306,2.7456,3.877,0.2158,0.1981,1.3803,0.8697,1.5119,5.2824,0.912,4.9124,0.3354,0.0221,3.2649,4.5337,2.0344,6.5421,2.4436,2.0534,3.3391,0.054,1.2612,2.6551,3.8202,0.7176,0.3307,5.0734,1.9617,4.773,0.437,3.103,2.3304,0.4948,4.6067,2.6399,1.4044,2.8606,1.2637,0.4852,0.7177,0.0002,0.6754,3.9645,1.1752,1.2534,0.0178,5.007,0.1953,2.2545,1.3665,0.8907,0.152,2.1726,0.1081,0.0591,0.0069,0.0042,6.1974,0.507,2.8843,1.8239,5.0555,5.0501,4.3233,0.1562,0.6117,0.1967,5.9596,2.4865,0.0004,3.1755,4.7714,2.387,0.1564,3.5062,5.1764,4.4781,2.4403,0.9791,0.106,1.9062,0.811,0.247,4.9888,3.5282,0.0589,2.4457,0.5028,1.5213,1.5983,0.0002,5.3213,0.4327,0.0276,2.0336,0.7149,1.0886,1.064,0.8088,2.5978,2.6671,4.4446,0.1493,0.1174,4.1445,1.1213,1.5624,2.6681,0.642,1.2767,5.2928,2.4998,3.1051,2.414,2.7169,0.0085,0.0208,3.3602,4.4542,3.1636,4.0652,0.7413,0.7009,0.662,1.067,5.4876,3.555,0.4882,0.0226,1.0675,2.9416,0.2497,0.0049,1.2517,4.3896,2.9686,0.3667,0.878,0.0002,0.6027,1.998,1.9298,1.9501,0.1623,0.07,0.0057,0.0061,1.9734,0.3453,0.392,0.503,0.1139,2.1111,0.5572,0.0387,0.0049,0.0192,0.0326,5.7141,0.0993,1.7868,0.0001,0.5706,6.7012,3.2406,0.2589,0.0821,0.5937,0.0052,0.0039,0.7842,4.3194,1.438,2.8362,0.4727,1.0033,4.2833,3.7544,0.2958,2.3824,1.3029,4.689,5.7094,5.0865,2.2441,3.0701,3.8088,2.6179,1.3618,0.36,3.8839,0.2643,0.6729,1.9754,1.5515,3.125,2.0791,3.0081,0.3096,0.0414,6.5123,0.8174,5.3054,0.9334,0.8733,5.4984,0.077,0.4233,1.0275]}

A small number were purchased directly by private consumers, while larger numbers were acquired second @ -hand and imported to Israel in the year 2000 by the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nThe primary purpose of the second generation Storm did not change until 2001.\n\nThe Storm R1 was not a significant development in the Storms field, though it has become known for its relatively large payload and its relatively low cost.\n\nIt is a second generation model with significant technological advances. However, it suffers from a significant number of technical issues that have seriously affected its operation. (For review of these concerns see \" The Storm R2: A Storm with A Purpose \".)\n\nThe Storm A1 was a successful test vehicle, but its performance did not provide the required level of performance to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. It remained in service until 2002, when it was withdrawn from service due to significant technical issues.\n\nThe Storm R2 is a model created and built under license from the original Storm A1. It is the latest in a long line of Storms.\n\nThe purpose of this page is to provide a set of resources that highlight Storm history and technical performance, but also serve as a site where you can contact Storm manufacturer Israel Aircraft Industries, who have maintained the public website here at the Naval Air Systems Command.\n\nYou can contact them directly by emailing this author at This email address is being protected from spambots.

One author has suggested that Israel Air Force personnel should contact IAI and ask if this is an issue. No such contact yet has been made.\n\nIt is not known yet if IAI or its partners will continue to maintain the Storm history page or make it free for reuse, but you can contact them using the information below.

{"id":4344,"ended":true,"length":541,"gen_text":"While making landfall in central Vietnam, winds of 140 km \/ h ( 85 mph ) were measured due to the typhoon. A total of 30 persons perished. Around 72 @, more than 20 were injured in the storm's gusty winds. The typhoon was classified as a serious storm according to the NHC, although it has not been officially classified as a Category 3 Storm as of Saturday evening.\n\nTyphoon Nangka swept across Vietnam before landfall and knocked down power lines.\n\nIt is the second typhoon to pass south of Vietnam in less than 12 hours. Typhoon Phailin, the first typhoon to hit the country in over three weeks, pummelled the central coastal province of Quang Nam on Saturday.\n\nNangka, which is an especially strong category 3 storm, has killed at least 30 people in Vietnam in the past five days, according to the government's data. Officials have not reported any deaths from Phailin, which struck China late on Friday, but there have been at least 15 casualties from Nangka so far during the typhoon.\n\nWeather experts say the difference in these two storms and the intensity of their winds should not be ignored, however.\n\n\"The difference is that (Phailin) is already weakening away from Vietnam and Nangsaka has been intensifying for two phases right at the start of its life cycle... So while their death tolls are the same, their damages are huge too,\" said Anh Hung Huy, associate professor at the Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nWeathermen said the winds of Phailin and Nangka, which typically move in the N-E direction, could have shifted southeastwards by now, due to a complex and highly unusual weather pattern that is playing out at the time.\n\n\"The Typhoon Nangka is not as violent as Phailin, but its storm surge and intensity will be greater,\" said Hoang Phuong Nguyen, a senior meteorologist with the Vietnam Weather Bureau. \"The typhoon is going to be stronger than Phailin, and it has been going for a longer period of time.\"\n\nA number of ships and ships' companies operating in the Bay of Cham in North Vietnam have halted work following the typhoon, officials said.\n\n\"This year's typhoon season is relatively heavy. The weather for next week is going to be terrible, with severe heavy storms likely to be developing,\" Nhung Quang Vinh, the head of the Cham River Forecasting Centre, told Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe storm surge reached 10-15 mms (6-9 ft) when Nangka slammed into the central coastal province Quang Nam on Friday night.\n\nQuang Nam's coastal population has fled the areas that

There is a higher incidence of heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, among other chronic medical illnesses.\n\nAnd chronic MDS\/AML patients are at a greater risk of experiencing mental disorders as well, some of which can lead to suicide.\n\nThe medical and mental health care system must improve coordination on treatment protocols, and increase monitoring of patients to ensure that they have adequate access to needed treatment.\n\nIt is time to acknowledge that these drug-resistant genetic diseases have severe medical risks, and that patients must not be punished for being diagnosed.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies should be held accountable for the dangerous drugs they make and sell to vulnerable patients in our communities.\n\nReferences

The North \/ South Ministerial Council has played a leading role in the establishment of those institutions, and the Unionist Parties have agreed to work with them to secure a permanent future across those islands.\nAn Alternative Way Of View - a Briefer Summary An Alternative Way Of View - June 2015\nThe Republic of Ireland should seek to achieve a settlement incorporating a settlement for the whole island based on respect for the special position of the north-south Border.\nAn Alternative Way Of View - The Present State Of Things (For The Time Being)\nA settlement would be based on a fair and equitable settlement of the long running differences between the North and South, including:\nA Permanent Solution to the Border\nCurrency\nA common travel area with free movement from London to Belfast\nA Common Travel Area across North and South\nThe Northern and Southern governments would be committed to achieving a settlement that meets the following principles:\nThere would be a comprehensive Common Travel Area for all of Northern Ireland including the North Border Road. This would include the North\/South Ministerial Council, a Common Travel Area Authority and the Northern Ireland Office.\nThe current free movement of EU citizens between the North and South would be maintained, however, the free movement of people with the right of entry will be controlled. This 'emergency brake' will apply to anyone who has entered the UK from Northern Ireland but subsequently left the UK in breach of the terms of the EU's Dublin Regulation.\nThe Northern Ireland Office will be able to manage the free movement of people in line with the arrangements in force between the UK and EU.

{"id":4114,"ended":true,"length":603,"gen_text":"A music video for the song was directed by Lil X on the weekend of July 4, 2010 in Los Angeles. Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who they would like to see play Lil B in the video:\n\n\nIt's interesting that Lil B would want to have Lil Rizzo play him in this video. Lil Rizzo's stage time at a Lil B show might be on the lower tier, but he was once called the 'Pied Piper' of Odd Future.\n\nIn a blog about Lil B's music video for \"I Am A God,\" the writer said that Lil B has a problem with the music video:\n\n[\u2026] the music video he's made for I Am A God is a masterpiece, with a perfect rhythm, beautiful graphics, and one of the most interesting story lines ever told on a rap video. But it is also really, really bad. Everything about it is a waste of time.\n\n[\u2026] the most egregious sin of it, however, is the music itself. A few months ago, Lil B got his friends at Odd Future Records in California to contribute the music for this video. Their input seemed minimal. Noted internet philosopher David Wong noted that \"The whole thing is a mishmash of songs from different artists, mostly made by one of the founders, Tyler, which is so weird because Tyler has so many great songs under his belt. At the same time, the songs don't fit with one another, and I don't know why they got in there.\"\n\nIn the video, Lil B is shown sitting in a chair, wearing sunglasses and a suit, and he is playing a guitar. The music comes from hip-hop and funk artists including Jay Z, De La Soul, Mos Def, and Fat Joe, at least one featuring the rapper as a guest (\"Big Beast.\" I am a king \/ I do my part \/ No one's a queen). The lead vocalist for this group is rapper Lil Rizzo, who just so happens to be Tyler's childhood friend. In the song's song summary, Minaj reveals that she did not want Lil B, Big Boi, or even Tyler to contribute something for the video.\n\nThe original song that Lil B composed was called \"Blow Your Mind\", and was originally released in 2004. When Lil B was only 13 years old, \"Blow Your Mind\" was a pop hit that peaked at 10 on Billboard's Top 100.\n\nTyler, the Creator's Big Boi is featured quite prominently in the video, performing a new song called \"Get Low\" that features the line: \"I'm going to be on that Lil B song.\" Big Boi is also one of the few artists included in the video who doesn't appear in the entire video.\n\nWhen

{"id":2276,"ended":true,"length":601,"gen_text":"McCain's return to the United States reunited him with his family. His wife Carol had suffered her own crippling ordeal due to an automobile accident in December 1969. McCain became a celebrity in the United States when he participated in the 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns of Republican Barry Goldwater and Democrat Hubert Humphrey. After the election, McCain returned to the Senate in 1973, where he served until he was elected to the presidency.\nWith the help of Carol and their children and grandchildren, McCain established a foundation designed to promote and defend academic integrity and academic freedom at the University of Arizona. The foundation became the foundation for the Arizona Higher Education Coordinating Board. Following the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, he joined with Senator Barry Goldwater in forming the American Committee for Peace in the Middle East. McCain's work as a member of the Senate committee, along with his service in the Senate and military career, won him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He also authored the Senate resolution that established the McCain Institute for International Leadership, founded to foster the work of international leaders.\nIn addition, he served during the Vietnam War as a Navy Reserve pilot, flying nearly 60 combat missions in which he shot down two MiGs in a mock dogfight. McCain also earned numerous awards from the Pentagon and was twice awarded the Legion of Merit, one of the United States military's highest civilian honors. In 2001, he presented then-Sen. Barack Obama with the Congressional Medal of Honor during an appearance on the \"Ellen\" show.\nHe had planned to leave law enforcement after his retirement from the Navy, but after being diagnosed with brain cancer, he decided to continue his work and serve as a reserve police officer in Washington, D.C. During his time in the Senate, he also served in the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee. One of the first things he did after being diagnosed was to visit a Washington neighborhood with the help of an aide.\nIn June 2011, McCain was elected to the Senate again after losing a Republican primary battle with Mark Begich for his senate seat in 2010. In November, he won a general election over Republican challenger Brian Schatz. During his campaign, McCain pledged to use his military service as a qualification for president. Senator McCain's political biography on his Senate website states that \"at age 78, he is one of the oldest men ever elected to the United States Senate and the longest-tenured Senator living.\"\nIn 2016, Senator McCain announced that he would be releasing a new book -- his first published work since being diagnosed with brain cancer. This book, \"After the Fall: My Fifty-Year Mission to Defend the American Dream\", was co-written by Paul Sexton, a journalist and longtime biographer of Senator John McCain. The book is a testament to the man that Senator McCain is and his determination to make the world a better place. The book is also an insightful look behind the scenes, revealing that McCain was much more than a politician. He was an avid philanthropist and a tireless promoter of human rights across the globe. This is one man that will never give up, no matter what.","token_len":634,"entropy":[2.0956,2.0325,6.409,0.7718,0.7725,4.1972,0.0161,11.6076,0.4134,0.0323,0.7151,1.4913,1.9798,2.7922,1.3731,6.5832,3.643,4.6683,7.0728,0.8985,7.2905,6.3157,6.1585,0.0093,3.5896,5.3508,0.0544,1.3695,4.8024,4.5991,0.7276,3.2731,5.3161,1.1856,6.0603,1.8154,1.2015,1.7112,0.0147,2.8414,0.4614,5.616,0.0605,0.7868,4.1063,3.2134,0.2538,1.1347,1.3481,1.8609,2.562,2.525,0.0007,0.0,1.1263,0.3014,1.0736,0.0,0.0045,0.0002,0.3103,3.269,1.6075,1.0458,0.6683,0.4789,0.8761,0.1868,1.1961,1.6758,2.4467,1.3483,1.6168,1.0167,0.0545,0.6661,0.7927,1.9614,0.4193,1.4257,0.2951,0.2974,0.8244,2.6061,0.9655,11.7379,1.2336,3.4794,0.0088,5.841,1.4667,1.3627,2.4548,3.7913,0.1791,0.0855,0.2841,4.331,1.0734,0.8919,5.8533,0.0216,2.8733,3.4778,4.1561,6.5779,2.9799,1.2197,1.8045,0.057,2.5451,1.1423,0.4901,0.0279,0.4916,0.2607,1.7475,1.1536,3.8818,1.4156,5.364,0.4986,0.6344,3.1642,4.9315,0.0258,1.755,0.0045,0.3791,1.8174,6.3174,1.6452,3.187,0.1639,0.4741,1.4558,0.9522,0.2973,0.0509,5.039,4.3282,2.1734,1.2622,1.9183,0.0053,0.0002,2.2593,2.8844,0.2195,3.4078,3.8553,0.1364,1.0088,0.6549,1.6417,0.2286,0.0003,1.096,1.4906,2.4263,3.9161,2.2633,0.2884,2.5262,0.0242,0.289,1.0197,4.9972,3.6709,2.6006,0.0015,0.39,3.5071,1.1488,0.1412,1.3332,1.3845,4.6713,3.9463,0.177,5.107,0.1736,0.7195,1.9258,0.0256,0.0027,0.0008,1.7056,2.1327,2.4116,4.59,0.904,4.916,1.1315,1.709,1.5901,0.1716,1.3588,0.188,0.2271,0.0167,0.0024,1.9151,4.6553,2.6349,3.4967,2.2522,5.7724,0.0459,2.3606,0.3932,1.0899,0.8253,1.5167,3.2557,1.9659,2.2274,1.8235,6.7763,0.6274,0.8212,0.1367,0.3065,0.4335,2.196,5.9484,2.2801,1.4915,2.1166,4.6771,4.546,0.3802,0.0266,1.8721,3.7795,0.1126,2.0291,0.0033,1.9168,1.1652,0.4495,3.7157,3.1726,5.3523,0.3662,0.0281,0.6173,2.102,2.3816,2.8666,3.7516,1.5342,3.7022,0.4045,4.1881,1.4021,3.2305,4.7644,0.8042,0.1032,3.5898,0.0072,0.0045,0.0024,1.7743,2.9887,0.1953,0.1578,2.6864,0.0045,1.7038,0.0156,0.0296,1.7936,0.5119,0.1131,2.287,4.6611,0.1485,1.1272,6.8768,3.8345,0.3444,4.9517,0.42,2.0114,0.0021,0.1609,0.2016,2.6197,1.8992,0.0114,0.0267,3.7787,2.3762,3.8257,0.9857,0.614,2.6602,3.9416,0.0008,0.7503,0.732,0.2802,0.65,3.4195,4.4245,5.2984,0.1044,4.273,8.2941,0.8387,2.5609,0.9227,1.6513,1.8361,0.0165,1.082,1.0189,0.1999,3.0465,2.7976,1.0799,0.0619,1.6915,0.0127,1.3229,0.3689,1.0104,0.1612,1.6848,0.9897,1.3852,3.8582,3.6309,1.059,0.7388,4.3813,1.9923,0.0313,1.5667,4.1921,0.3387,0.28,0.0011,0.0034,0.1346,3.701,0.8004,1.6215,0.891,0.765,2.6743,0.0594,1.1165,2.4913,0.9554,3.6148,0.2408,1.4191,0.0487,0.3091,1.1061,4.386,0.0075,0.1809,0.4209,6.8145,0.1087,1.658,2.2382,1.978,0.5857,0.0975,1.5979,1.7322,1.7344,1.0157,0.6946,3.3239,3.0022,3.7483,4.2024,3.292,2.102,2.7379,0.006,4.1428,1.7099,0.9339,1.3182,1.5532,4.3245,3.0431,0.0297,0.5987,1.3407,4.7152,0.2222,1.6645,1.3678,1.4964,3.5265,3.3154,1.6436,3.4295,0.0371,3.8232,3.2593,4.2302,3.4907,0.0001,4.1906,1.3948,4.8455,0.0026,0.753,1.5449,0.0415,2.2162,2.8391,2.0454,0.5419,2.0991,1.0841,3.3815,0.0087,3.0311,2.529,0.5899,4.9507,1.062,0.0004,1.0865,3.7768,0.3119,2.2961,0.1112,0.3232,3.6683,0.1479,5.3085,0.4089,1.8706,1.3672,0.8744,0.3438,2.9207,0.3939,4.3953,0.7915,6.4934,0.2029,2.3494,4.7959,4.3525,3.0564,0.6531,1.4162,0.1962,1.2498,0.9664,1.8588,5.6781,1.7396,4.7298,0.1423,1.0494,1.5462,2.8093,0.0148,0.1998,0.9369,3.6798,0.3154,0.1884,0.0207,0.083,0.7355,0.0018,0.0349,2.3787,1.0195,3.0063,0.7596,5.1646,0.0002,2.2338,7.417,0.4283,0.5209,1.6438,4.0979,0.0352,2.0064,0.0926,2.1632,0.7416,0.0675,0.3278,1.1999,5.0624,1.0357,1.4168,0.4664,7.0526,2.1718,1.4702,4.1926,0.8568,0.6636,3.2481,0.3262,0.0425,0.2289,0.0033,1.3268,4.0859,1.0728,1.0736,3.346,4.8729,2.1743,1.2774,0.3801,3.99,3.4521,0.2052,0.3096,0.346,0.6583,5.8271,0.0853,2.8801,0.9317,0.9747,2.7994,1.4785,3.2279,0.0432,0.9699,1.0697,5.584,4.2297,5.2211,1.0601,1.1751,3.3995,1.0699,4.0518,5.7274,0.0005,0.3849,1.0789,3.2696,0.0259,0.2935,1.0445,0.2722,1.3714,2.4325,5.012,0.0394,0.8333,2.2835,1.9297,1.6174,0.0942,1.3092,0.8752,2.3551,4.6331,0.1408,3.3514,0.8494,1.1967,0.0806,0.0678,0.0258,0.476,2.0274,0.4601,1.2189,3.4191,1.9659,5.1583,0.747,5.289,0.0865,0.1616,4.1049,2.5271,3.6359,1.6755,1.7512,5.5759,0.1518,0.2146,1.156,1.3737,0.9387,1.5714,0.5247,2.3489,3.9021,4.6085,0.0052,1.3185,1.4639,3.4202,0.0003,5.1447,0.1338,2.5919,0.1029,4.8321,0.0251,0.264,0.1139,3.5042,1.9884,3.5886,2.0438,1.6684,2.4385,2.3389,2.6099,0.0173,1.9876,1.3133,0.0008,0.6799,1.1931]}
{"id":3709,"ended":true,"length":579,"gen_text":"In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the < unk > acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This process takes about one minute in the absence of oxygen and two minutes while we breathe, but because of the long half-lifes of hydrogen and oxygen the cycle actually cycles twice as fast while we are alive. The metabolism of anaerobic bacteria uses electrons to produce ADP and PEP and ATP thus the cell can have up to three ATP-producing reactions per second.\n\nThe other major source of oxidative phosphorylation energy comes from the breakdown of carbohydrates with the use of ATP, but most of this production is done by glycolysis where glucose is broken down with ADP into pyruvate followed by the further splitting of pyruvate into two metabolites: lactate (2nd in importance after pyruvate) and acetoacetate (1st in importance than pyruvate). However there is one important problem with the use of ATP, the production of ATP is limited by the availability of electrons. If the electron density in the cell is reduced to zero, ATP can not be produced, however this is limited by the energy stored in the glycogen (sugar). The rate of turnover of the various glycogen molecules, which is the limiting factor, is dependent on the availability of oxygen. This is why we breathe, the oxygen is used to remove oxygen from the blood flow. The same oxygen that makes oxygen necessary to oxygenate our muscles as they work to produce energy that can then power metabolic processes like respiration can also be used to provide glucose for fuel (and if necessary give up oxygen for ATP by taking up nitric oxide). When oxygen is used for energy we lose an electron and this is the electron which is lost to produce ATP. Nitrogen is a carbon atom and provides two electrons so that we can take two ATP' s so there is not a big problem using it. The only problem is how this nitrogen is removed from the cell, it may be used by any other biochemical reaction using an enzyme such as a carboxylase. We use an enzyme called NADPH oxidase to break down NAD(P)H (i.e. the form of nitrogen that comes from nitrogen) in our mitochondria. This is important because without oxygen the NAD(P)H can be converted into uric acid. This is a toxic waste product (but useful to the body in detoxifying cellular components) and is removed, along with the nitrogen it gives off, by this enzyme. Thus, the loss of an electron occurs if we try to use ATP directly, and so there is a limit on our metabolic rate. The only time that ATP production rates are increased is during periods of high demand for ATP that can be provided by the oxygen we breathe in, this is known as O2 use. If we do not breathe enough oxygen then our metabolic rate can be increased and if we breathe way too much there may be the effects of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) in our muscles.","token_len":635,"entropy":[13.5102,2.7309,0.0045,0.0076,0.9194,1.8167,6.9115,5.9314,0.7872,8.6509,1.114,2.6501,9.6638,2.502,0.0014,1.0508,11.1596,11.6015,2.2713,2.5256,8.7843,5.3385,1.2652,1.632,0.1478,3.1543,2.3377,2.9334,4.2805,1.6357,0.6097,1.4822,0.4695,3.118,0.7154,0.5202,2.5214,1.8041,4.5816,4.4949,3.3362,2.3779,2.9107,1.2095,2.7581,0.0023,0.6367,2.1901,2.8306,0.3639,6.2608,6.3588,1.3985,3.4393,1.5758,5.277,1.1535,0.5393,5.2826,1.5588,0.1245,5.1852,0.0681,0.2235,5.6127,1.5434,0.4085,3.8704,4.1448,4.8,5.2699,3.0207,0.5924,0.552,4.5946,0.2883,1.408,1.3429,0.3861,2.095,5.8497,0.2274,2.8715,0.9422,0.2125,1.7119,3.2577,4.3965,1.5435,2.0183,4.5766,0.0022,0.9548,2.5357,3.6925,2.026,1.9479,7.4163,2.1465,4.6295,1.3587,5.2499,3.7808,0.0035,2.6047,1.6448,1.9092,1.4254,0.8949,1.3695,0.3574,0.6213,1.4496,0.0095,1.7334,4.6152,2.117,2.1738,0.0127,5.0483,0.2696,0.0019,0.0053,2.4786,2.4944,0.0356,0.9639,3.6074,0.0251,2.0966,5.3732,0.7279,3.0004,0.0032,1.9492,2.2139,2.0831,4.4057,0.5241,1.6918,5.74,0.8121,1.3667,1.2439,2.1827,0.0099,0.0003,0.0865,4.398,2.1331,0.4839,0.7168,0.0254,5.2789,4.4004,0.0012,4.5501,0.4715,0.0004,0.0463,0.0015,5.74,0.0165,0.8113,5.7214,3.3479,0.1124,0.5123,0.0011,0.007,0.0016,0.279,1.2966,4.9261,1.8233,0.9178,0.0001,2.9511,4.3601,5.0926,3.1491,3.1713,1.722,1.1272,0.0001,0.002,0.0004,0.2813,0.0312,1.3458,4.4791,0.0031,0.0146,0.8671,1.9424,0.0159,0.4437,0.0287,6.2821,1.1651,0.0002,0.002,0.0001,0.3049,5.1086,4.6167,0.6434,2.8842,2.6348,4.9151,0.387,1.8763,2.1771,0.0036,1.5791,3.1565,2.4014,3.4355,0.0872,1.4732,1.3979,2.0418,0.4634,0.2127,1.3454,0.0074,1.9856,1.0731,2.4442,1.3332,2.1835,2.6086,1.3051,0.2969,0.9599,0.5366,2.6027,2.4034,2.4075,0.8422,2.0076,2.7134,1.8524,0.0545,0.6611,2.2072,4.3673,2.6653,1.0937,6.0673,0.6105,0.1642,2.7909,2.9303,0.1288,0.5753,3.9238,0.0179,3.3956,2.7306,0.1054,3.4471,2.2865,4.5077,0.5534,6.1888,0.1754,1.8411,6.443,2.2389,0.0047,1.9197,3.8203,2.6964,1.72,2.0684,3.8462,0.0749,2.8364,0.5739,2.9575,0.1919,0.2215,1.9064,0.0215,2.9564,1.1234,3.2198,0.9249,1.4267,2.9349,3.4714,1.4963,1.7155,1.393,1.7491,1.5654,0.3417,3.8321,3.0802,0.2576,0.2351,0.4666,5.7395,2.0288,2.1406,4.442,2.6592,1.7646,5.0169,4.3274,4.3094,1.5796,3.9622,0.0846,1.6675,1.88,4.3842,3.1254,1.4255,1.3406,1.4738,1.5895,5.7236,2.4708,1.4874,4.3289,7.3679,0.4734,4.5372,1.8745,0.0028,4.9192,0.1586,0.842,0.1398,0.2195,4.5458,3.8589,1.0834,4.9306,4.465,3.9059,5.4888,3.3518,5.381,2.5375,1.8478,2.0819,2.1946,5.7289,4.4807,0.7066,3.5761,0.21,0.0069,1.0598,4.1306,1.714,0.4906,2.4997,1.8295,1.5611,3.4693,2.9456,3.9941,0.0303,1.5009,2.2866,1.3999,2.2954,3.1338,4.1313,0.7034,1.9119,2.5442,2.4911,0.3535,0.4036,6.6007,0.5061,0.9464,2.2864,4.3433,0.2428,1.5211,6.1453,3.0592,0.0806,2.7962,2.937,2.2972,0.5909,3.0171,2.3984,2.7123,5.4946,2.4803,5.9923,3.7757,0.3789,3.5505,1.1179,3.766,1.3648,4.3809,1.4687,2.5002,2.4343,2.9386,0.6785,0.569,3.8244,4.5547,2.0789,0.4341,2.9629,0.7131,0.1236,0.8955,2.0891,2.2791,5.1637,0.3587,1.9968,1.9008,5.2789,2.8804,4.2412,1.7706,6.3811,2.7448,3.8823,2.7137,0.0076,3.3737,4.6341,0.009,0.1884,0.1127,1.9407,4.6546,3.2831,2.6692,0.1992,0.3693,3.8103,0.8883,0.2624,0.0062,0.554,2.5077,0.0865,0.5484,4.4028,0.0359,0.0524,0.0278,2.4766,5.0819,0.035,0.0033,0.0705,1.93,2.62,0.0931,1.8111,1.7373,5.1002,0.4252,4.0528,3.2959,3.1476,2.3084,2.0701,0.0044,1.3841,1.5202,1.4712,3.4177,0.616,3.5479,2.1495,1.9389,2.0994,1.9637,0.0013,0.0066,0.0075,2.3007,1.9924,1.0748,1.0239,4.8191,0.1272,0.0044,2.6413,1.6496,0.9146,1.7732,3.1346,1.1559,0.1182,4.7043,5.2458,4.8278,2.5962,1.8201,0.5616,1.9242,5.5438,0.2965,5.1255,4.4935,0.785,0.7413,1.8932,1.8001,6.8082,2.3303,0.0021,1.0328,2.0044,3.229,4.6145,1.4245,0.1514,0.5348,6.3291,0.296,0.4172,5.0381,2.1549,1.7836,4.5844,0.0167,1.3197,0.045,5.8353,5.925,1.121,3.9639,0.0724,0.9098,1.7134,3.5905,1.5589,2.7872,3.7374,3.6495,0.3742,0.7143,1.8948,1.6357,4.1758,4.8526,1.0299,0.6846,2.6153,3.5602,3.1762,1.5386,2.0785,2.4526,5.6572,0.9078,1.8332,0.4823,2.4725,2.4911,0.1246,1.2978,3.5864,1.0682,1.8184,5.4237,2.3377,0.4704,2.9429,0.1996,1.167,4.786,2.0447,0.8908,1.2014,1.8502,3.024,0.425,2.3359,0.0086,4.7555,1.3647,3.4921,0.4815,3.7549,0.971,3.1313,0.0968,0.705,1.4583,0.1485,2.2663,2.106,2.219,0.193,2.4087,0.993,0.3978,3.2448,3.3961,0.3097,0.5225,6.493,0.252,0.213,4.8912,3.2908,0.1608,5.2869,6.0461,0.1856,1.4525,0.0817,0.008,1.6666,0.9113,0.0135,0.009,0.0091,0.744,3.3417,1.7282,2.1325,1.1302]}

The star and eight-pointed star were replaced by four stars on a white field. The flag has no specific significance for national or world unity. The flag with two red circles was adopted by Japan for use during the 1900-01 war for the purpose of defense against foreign forces. This flag was adopted on November 24, 1915, by the Imperial Commission on the Allied Military Preparations in the Far East, which was formed with the Imperial Regent, Prince Tenno Yoshida, as its chairman. The colors used were red, white and green. The flag also has five white stars on a red field. The use of the flag grew as Japan sought to develop an empire, and the Hinomaru was present at celebrations after victories in the First Sino @ - @ Japanese and Russo @ - @ Russo - Japanese wars (1894-1896), the Russo -Japanese War (1904-05) and the Russo - @ - @ Russo - Japanese War (1904). This flag had similar symbolistic use as the Japanese Imperial flag (above). When Japan was at peace as a member of the League of Nations, it was common to use a blue canton and green background.\n\nThis flag changed design in 1933 and a smaller star was placed on a white background.\n\nWorld War I\n\nThe Japanese troops in World War I were in the Suez Canal region. They were forced to fight the Germans in an extremely difficult military environment. Japanese soldiers were under the impression that the Allies were advancing towards Japan. The Japanese government adopted the motto O-sama y\u016b (Victory may be achieved by any means), and the flag was modified accordingly; the red color was replaced by white and the four stars were moved from three to two.\n\nIt was used during the final months of the war, by the Japanese armed forces in the Crimea. When the Allies had advanced further into the heart of the Eastern territories, they decided to make the Japanese surrender after 10:00 am on 26 May, despite the refusal of the Japanese leadership. On 27 May, it was decided to proceed with the surrender, despite this, however, the Allies were not able to present a valid declaration of war, which would have terminated Japan's war effort without the need for further engagement. As a result, the Japanese surrender was postponed to 3:00 am on 4 June.\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring the war, the flag used was a simplified version of the regular version; a Japanese flag was no longer hoisted on top of a Japanese flagpole.\n\nReferences\n\nThis flag is sometimes confused with the National flag of Australia.","token_len":635,"entropy":[7.0115,0.0354,2.2026,7.4564,2.1439,10.3042,3.3226,7.1197,4.2366,0.2454,4.7123,2.6584,4.0562,2.1769,1.1851,1.7036,10.1396,0.344,0.1475,3.0885,8.7673,1.5698,6.1235,5.5693,4.248,1.19,0.7235,5.4401,0.2103,0.0164,16.4367,7.824,8.3619,5.6923,6.43,0.5308,3.2032,0.2545,0.6737,0.8335,1.6771,1.7171,0.9865,3.3731,0.8712,0.2694,0.666,1.2774,2.0065,1.9746,1.3495,0.8949,1.0923,0.0317,0.1018,0.2225,0.1308,0.0479,0.1769,2.06,1.401,0.0446,0.4565,1.0274,1.6595,2.7965,0.8447,0.4189,0.1233,0.5388,0.4382,0.0601,0.0682,0.007,0.5042,3.2028,1.5159,0.0217,4.6438,0.7792,1.0631,2.2475,1.9951,3.1136,3.1881,0.0636,3.9927,0.7644,1.3831,1.9812,2.3112,3.2185,0.0819,0.51,4.1443,1.3066,2.1675,1.1208,1.5959,6.0847,2.6791,4.9529,1.0478,0.1411,0.0131,0.8323,1.227,2.3525,0.3853,3.8409,2.089,2.2743,0.7967,1.9492,0.9506,0.9731,0.9251,1.6353,3.2327,3.4127,3.6971,2.3559,3.3305,3.2842,3.2873,5.7458,4.2926,1.0402,1.9097,1.1653,6.4678,3.9883,3.5213,4.227,1.9131,1.1468,2.122,1.7978,3.0418,1.3092,2.5647,0.5378,5.8573,1.9245,1.3532,1.6338,5.543,1.2207,1.335,0.0041,5.4592,1.1241,1.9193,3.9219,0.4269,2.919,0.313,0.7243,2.4951,1.3956,2.2763,3.953,0.0215,5.417,0.7063,2.9635,0.277,1.7226,5.2561,1.0276,1.1892,5.5205,2.5717,4.724,0.0446,2.3048,1.3084,0.3565,0.0136,1.5747,2.2569,0.9261,3.0365,4.5484,0.1816,3.5586,5.1079,0.8039,1.2595,1.8967,5.6839,1.2187,5.3287,2.6407,0.6792,0.7371,0.7953,1.0546,0.1474,1.1738,5.6026,3.357,1.447,0.8624,1.6488,0.1855,0.8778,3.0891,0.5077,1.3376,1.1475,4.4918,1.7917,4.0441,1.1055,0.6388,1.2637,0.1722,1.0753,0.6047,0.4376,1.2771,3.7306,0.0081,0.6143,0.3803,2.3012,0.2197,0.0199,0.0138,0.003,0.004,0.005,0.0028,0.048,0.0042,0.0119,0.0205,0.0001,0.0006,0.011,0.0033,0.004,0.0019,0.0047,0.0068,0.0018,0.0013,0.0042,0.0046,0.0002,0.2118,0.0273,0.0031,0.0405,0.0021,0.0007,0.1074,0.0005,0.0785,0.0018,0.0111,0.0246,0.0098,0.0029,0.0005,0.0007,0.0004,0.0009,0.0014,0.0004,0.0011,0.0006,1.1825,0.6044,0.0005,0.0011,0.0001,0.0001,0.0003,0.0014,0.0013,0.0007,0.0011,0.0005,0.0521,0.1258,0.0011,0.0116,0.0003,0.0022,0.0262,0.0006,0.0011,0.0002,0.0002,0.3497,3.4795,0.1625,5.3188,6.1399,6.0889,4.4545,3.1601,1.3441,0.2861,2.6628,3.5305,0.9075,3.1236,2.5734,1.1004,6.1229,1.1786,2.4164,2.9782,1.6725,6.8144,0.9205,3.9771,0.0366,0.0443,0.6715,0.0031,0.0022,0.457,1.9755,1.4341,5.1435,0.8875,0.9214,1.6628,2.5423,5.4329,0.0048,2.6049,4.52,2.8966,1.2251,1.3835,0.0002,1.9973,0.06,6.7575,4.959,1.7762,4.2877,2.35,4.3287,4.9726,2.348,0.4364,2.4548,1.1922,1.3136,0.7083,1.1784,0.3796,1.7482,0.0002,6.1725,0.1342,2.0226,1.409,0.0003,1.2997,2.3472,6.3796,2.1392,1.7249,0.0032,0.0257,1.2768,4.4301,1.5585,4.698,4.406,0.0639,4.1491,1.8445,2.2471,1.1456,4.5047,0.1536,2.7263,2.4405,1.3574,1.9026,4.1792,5.2263,1.533,4.7769,2.8674,0.5518,3.6116,1.4158,1.6354,5.2407,1.6784,3.6967,0.0843,1.0408,2.9964,1.1378,4.8171,2.6533,1.1931,0.9447,1.6977,0.7173,2.8762,4.654,1.0238,5.2754,7.4042,1.8974,4.8448,5.5652,4.9181,2.2424,4.6659,0.027,5.8933,0.3198,2.3535,2.7153,3.8273,0.0351,1.5051,1.3032,1.7695,1.2463,0.7901,2.4033,2.1418,5.9089,0.6787,2.9697,3.3568,0.395,0.9111,0.2458,1.3892,1.487,0.2439,3.1058,1.4036,0.4541,3.4264,2.1425,5.8841,0.7085,0.5091,0.7608,1.3789,0.0002,4.977,0.8568,2.3152,2.0528,0.3017,4.9919,2.3512,0.0479,0.2277,0.0581,1.6325,5.0806,0.6716,1.0796,4.4485,0.0072,1.7057,0.9036,4.9251,2.1768,4.155,0.6331,3.187,4.5716,3.3304,4.6805,0.8361,0.8762,4.0689,0.0857,1.0456,4.2686,6.2833,0.6508,3.0462,2.9671,0.1176,4.1102,2.2418,1.9608,1.411,4.7017,6.3688,1.8035,0.1106,3.2924,0.676,6.645,2.4778,1.0291,5.1817,0.4701,4.7632,0.1249,0.5543,0.5925,4.1499,0.4772,2.9966,2.7836,0.0261,0.275,5.5166,0.1597,1.6073,0.9618,4.5687,0.7703,0.2043,0.8643,1.8447,3.1433,5.4817,1.629,4.6898,0.0699,0.6087,4.0378,2.3665,2.2043,1.2211,0.0051,5.4088,1.6222,4.2921,4.3394,0.3919,1.0711,2.1365,2.4453,3.1591,0.4405,4.5462,3.6053,0.0451,2.0268,3.0385,5.4974,2.411,1.1077,0.4797,1.7545,5.8738,0.3618,3.5137,0.529,0.0889,0.1613,0.7846,0.9002,3.3565,0.4314,4.2195,1.9742,3.3313,0.9253,0.0914,1.9961,0.1938,2.5878,0.0837,0.7179,1.0847,0.0002,2.2076,0.0016,0.016,0.0733,0.0003,2.376,1.1831,1.3573,0.2652,0.6057,1.3404,4.5934,1.4917,1.728,2.6894,0.143,0.1033,0.094,6.6026,3.6577,3.7859,3.1072,4.4383,1.1134,1.2889,5.0079,0.0062,5.4032,0.0005,2.2318,2.2865,0.0737,1.347,1.7465,0.7212,1.1946,0.6143,1.7208,0.0002,5.8223,0.4395,0.0002,4.6927,0.8994,0.9775,4.763,2.7427,0.0573,0.1899,5.4382,1.3846,0.4429,4.0772,0.8522]}
{"id":1571,"ended":true,"length":577,"gen_text":"A tropical wave emerged from Africa on April 29. It then moved across the Atlantic, crossed northern South America, and entered the Pacific Ocean on May 9. Convection started to increase in the North Atlantic that afternoon, and eventually broke the record previously set on May 16 for the largest tropical storm in the Atlantic Ocean. On May 15, the hurricane-force winds extended from the eastern Caribbean coast to the coasts of Brazil and Bolivia, causing billions of dollars of damage before it finally weakened to a tropical depression.\n\nA tropical storm named Gilbert briefly formed on May 1 and then quickly weakened, moving east-northeast near Bermuda. The hurricane-force winds were measured at 11 knots (25 mph; 46 km\/h; 19 knots), but the storm was not strong enough to surpass the intensity level of category 3 or greater. As a result, Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical depression on May 18.\n\nOn May 12, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey and the East Coast. In its wake, it strengthened to a hurricane and crossed the mid-Atlantic Ocean, churning toward the New England coast. This wind-driven storm reached hurricane strength on May 19, knocking out power to some 20 million people in the region.\n\nA tropical storm formed on May 6, prompting a tropical depression named Sandy to form near the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Sandy then moved into the eastern Caribbean Sea on May 11, then shifted north along the coast of the United States and entered the eastern Atlantic Ocean on May 12. Sandy strengthened over the next days into a hurricane that then caused thousands of flights to be canceled.\n\nAfter a brief reprieve, Tropical Storm Humberto formed on May 5 in the North Sea, then caused extreme disruption in the Atlantic Ocean on May 9. It strengthened rapidly thereafter, with winds at Category One (105 mph; 185 kph; 90 knots) as of May 13. Although Humberto weakened to a tropical depression on May 14, it still damaged thousands of properties over the next two days.\n\nMeteorologists said Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage in the southern Bahamas on May 12, including destroying homes in the Nassau County, which was hit hardest. It also forced the United States Joint Forces Command in Germany to issue a shelter-in-place order for the small island nation of Dominica. The hurricane caused flooding in Honduras and heavy winds in the Dominican Rep\u00fablica.\n\nTropical Depression Juan formed on May 12, and became closely followed by Hurricane Camille on May 21. Both formed with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph; 79 knots). They weakened dramatically before weakening again. Juan became a remnant low on May 14, and moved inland along the east coast of Mexico near the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHurricane Patricia formed just hours before landfall on the Mexico-Guatemala border, on May 11.

A prominent example of this is the scene with the family, with Alan Rickman's character being forced to take control of events from the sidelines. This is one of the few times where Rickman played a villain.","token_len":635,"entropy":[7.5115,6.3188,4.933,1.3979,2.0305,8.6892,0.0719,5.2748,3.2615,11.6127,0.0256,0.6553,6.1951,5.8065,7.5504,0.1208,2.8363,0.3336,0.8275,1.5502,3.6226,4.753,8.3015,8.1156,1.2437,9.9132,0.3538,0.0006,2.761,4.5309,0.6194,3.4673,9.73,0.7956,0.5131,4.1287,0.0721,3.5157,3.4314,3.0277,3.4379,2.8274,1.393,0.2646,0.7856,5.2259,2.5259,0.888,1.5127,0.5004,1.7024,5.8532,4.6872,5.0006,1.7766,0.1161,4.2464,0.2168,1.5179,5.5594,0.3235,0.0384,0.0014,0.0,1.8983,4.9907,1.2165,3.7419,2.9501,4.2419,1.3258,0.4742,0.8788,1.0594,4.7238,1.6201,4.8969,0.5938,0.4373,5.5144,3.0286,0.3617,0.4836,0.0001,0.9515,3.3654,3.1945,5.2139,1.5511,5.392,1.8952,3.0247,2.6066,1.7271,0.1568,4.898,0.0626,1.5385,1.989,4.8197,1.2734,5.3905,0.0029,0.1235,0.004,0.1003,0.2046,1.1068,3.8923,4.0266,0.6187,5.8586,1.7292,3.5357,4.0412,0.5165,0.0001,1.0168,1.8076,2.3722,2.1005,3.983,1.7821,1.7159,5.1398,2.9322,2.7392,0.6969,2.3994,0.3163,0.1214,2.115,4.7173,3.0453,0.8432,2.9309,3.5075,1.3884,1.276,2.2802,1.8345,1.4153,1.1897,0.8152,0.1039,1.9528,0.6184,1.4069,0.0732,0.0552,2.5272,0.3318,0.9032,0.0074,4.2192,0.8721,5.1652,0.5592,0.0001,4.226,4.9556,6.0472,5.554,1.6786,5.3881,0.4466,2.3366,0.4695,3.3847,2.4678,3.118,2.9737,0.1628,0.0022,0.5099,2.3717,0.6697,0.7491,3.6699,1.9401,2.8154,1.2588,0.583,0.0082,0.0007,2.7526,4.6953,0.8658,2.6688,3.8056,0.4095,0.8493,0.2052,2.1129,0.9944,1.5568,1.6885,0.0197,1.4654,0.0124,0.0019,1.2837,1.5478,1.1294,0.0175,0.0036,2.4087,0.3492,0.0297,0.3764,0.2501,1.6853,0.0533,0.7157,0.5725,0.9176,2.2323,0.0909,0.9144,0.0078,0.0507,0.0066,0.2541,1.058,0.0067,0.0041,2.2088,0.0255,0.5848,0.2004,0.0019,0.0015,0.0309,0.0009,0.0565,0.0004,0.001,0.0139,0.1235,0.0001,4.3536,1.3337,2.0767,2.1044,5.6573,2.8723,3.221,0.2976,0.0151,0.0744,0.2033,0.5527,0.0026,6.7788,3.2215,0.0457,2.3348,5.1197,0.9882,1.7074,0.7161,3.0325,2.1284,5.3233,1.3737,3.3394,3.4607,3.5485,4.8309,0.0101,1.0618,0.5317,5.4989,1.7323,1.1831,6.4804,5.4239,1.7576,0.5791,5.5091,1.4816,3.488,2.6619,4.4218,0.0178,1.1998,2.1835,0.0109,2.2681,2.1708,3.3099,0.047,1.6697,5.5953,6.2372,3.2158,0.025,6.0407,3.922,0.1618,0.9469,2.9678,0.6604,0.8947,2.1073,3.0767,2.1953,2.2862,1.4242,5.8102,1.982,4.6175,5.3157,3.6733,3.6244,4.9105,4.5374,4.0287,0.0739,0.0384,5.4215,0.0145,0.0167,1.7799,0.3977,0.0001,1.4797,2.7111,3.2289,1.2445,0.968,0.5028,0.788,4.2347,0.5543,0.4595,5.6412,0.1007,4.5074,3.005,2.3215,0.0248,6.8747,0.761,1.5342,1.628,1.7713,2.863,3.1348,2.5867,1.7713,1.5608,2.7634,2.9519,0.0155,0.0011,0.5731,0.049,0.0105,0.0186,0.1266,0.9957,7.4643,0.2593,0.2059,4.4539,5.3803,2.2224,4.2641,0.4312,1.4531,2.0722,0.6342,4.7873,1.3733,5.6317,0.0848,3.4572,0.7753,3.1587,2.1011,0.0031,0.0007,0.4725,0.0477,0.0043,0.0101,0.0262,1.1545,0.1386,0.0007,0.0194,0.8157,1.9924,0.004,0.0098,0.0102,0.0695,0.0268,0.5558,0.0079,0.0071,2.6455,0.9576,0.0008,0.0006,0.0009,10.2364,0.0458,0.0881,0.3456,0.2614,0.0107,0.1071,0.0548,0.0017,0.0027,0.0072,0.0961,0.0688,0.0737,0.0238,0.0224,0.6565,2.1745,0.0002,1.6315,0.0126,3.9578,0.1341,0.001,0.1884,0.6632,0.0657,0.2376,3.5047,3.5546,3.9369,5.4222,0.0369,3.3499,4.0004,0.1589,1.1446,2.3608,0.0645,0.192,0.4635,2.3351,0.8628,2.1404,0.2378,0.0593,1.7856,4.5562,3.0339,2.1005,4.2586,5.456,1.4938,1.0024,1.0584,3.7262,0.6405,2.1354,3.1398,5.6072,2.2912,2.3314,0.3824,0.1676,3.8948,1.2794,0.0127,0.1436,3.0563,1.2378,5.3642,7.0074,3.877,2.4301,3.1908,0.2919,3.7877,4.4,4.8316,0.043,1.5916,1.9967,2.2308,1.8094,1.5427,1.1474,2.8902,2.6697,2.3689,2.3349,0.8252,0.8951,3.602,1.9848,1.2715,2.3236,1.4464,5.1251,1.9534,0.9446,2.3106,0.8995,3.072,0.0148,0.0013,0.5893,0.0391,0.0212,0.0036,1.1106,2.1779,0.0002,0.9868,0.0083,0.9764,0.003,0.0008,0.1948,0.1273,0.0292,0.0059,1.4362,4.2187,3.406,1.0947,2.8582,4.6094,3.1734,1.2634,4.4777,2.0774,3.4019,1.115,2.3979,1.758,4.6514,5.247,0.2389,0.7557,1.3204,3.4593,2.3119,4.4723,0.0188,1.0255,0.0747,2.501,0.0078,0.0012,5.3558,1.1699,0.6121,0.0844,2.2947,3.3763,6.375,0.4627,1.244,2.7662,6.62,0.8741,0.3202,1.2779,1.173,0.3536,0.8353,0.6539,3.0941,0.1657,2.0512,2.0834,3.014,0.4468,4.155,0.1799,1.5319,5.707,1.6044,5.3624,4.9311,0.6869,1.6326,2.4863,0.4867,5.3691,5.8802,2.3111,0.4334,0.2636,0.2612,1.2194,0.7507,3.7546,1.2933,5.2206,3.7606,4.858,1.9444,0.0259,0.0029,1.32,0.6479,2.6051,4.3967,0.1176,3.562,4.9234,0.4477,5.4401,4.3133,1.0371,2.9724,0.5853,3.0997,1.4444,3.2756,0.0963,0.1845,2.4234,0.9139,2.1039,1.2294,0.0011,4.0956,0.9888,1.8288,1.7124]}
{"id":4310,"ended":true,"length":543,"gen_text":"Several earlier settlements were built near modern Southampton featuring protective town walls. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 the fortress settlement of Clausentum was established. It was an important trading center and its walls were in need of repair by the mid 1st Century AD, when construction of the Roman road south from London enabled the city to enjoy a new-found prosperity. The town wall could be reconfigured using Roman design techniques.\nWith the beginning of the 5th Century AD and the settlement of St. Augustine in the west, what is today Southampton became a significant European port-city, and the Roman foundation of St. Augustine church was consecrated in 437AD. There are a number of Roman ruins in the city centre and in the area surrounding St. Augustine. A number of Roman buildings may have survived intact until the 6th Century, although the ruins of another fort (the Lighthouse ) show signs of damage and deterioration after 1100AD. There is some evidence that the Lighthouse may have been built by Christian monks in the 4th and later centuries.\nThe Lighthouse remained in use for nearly 600 years and served Southampton well, not least because of the lighthouse keeper's long-term contract in 1609, with annual wages of about 575,000 (around \u00a310,000). The old lighthouse might even have survived in the 17th Century as a public museum.\nTHE LOST LORDS OF CANTERBURY\nIn the 6th and 7th Century the city of Canterbury gained the status of a duchy. It was at the end of this period of dominance that William of Normandy, Duke of Normandy invaded England and won the Battle of Hastings. During the 7th Century the city went through repeated occupation by the Vikings and Norman Conquest and in 878AD the city was razed by the Norse Norsemen and their 'god-men'.\nIt didn't take long before the Normans established another military capital on the south coast of the English Channel - a fortified city which was named 'Canterbury'.\u00a0\nBut Canterbury never really fully developed as a military center - during the Viking invasions it was largely used by local, free-fighting farmers. It wasn't until the Norman conquest of 1166AD that a major town was established. The Vikings were defeated, but a new Viking kingdom was established: Averell.\nCanterbury began to be occupied by a Norman garrison in 1170AD, but it soon became known as a centre for tax-farming and trading. By the middle of the 11th Century it had become one of the primary trading centers of the Norman world.\nToday it comprises five small towns and is known mainly for its numerous and ancient churches, many dating from the 13th Century.\nPorts to the north and south of Canterbury, including Pontefract and Dorsetshire, have existed since the 10th Century.\nThe city was also notable for the religious centres established by monks, including the abbey of St. Peter in 1224, St. Lawrence the First by 1252 and St. Augustine Church in the 16th Century.","token_len":635,"entropy":[8.1068,7.5933,1.8587,6.0446,3.6631,8.0671,10.7504,11.6144,9.0606,9.3684,0.151,1.7174,7.3795,0.6182,4.3315,2.039,0.7883,0.8728,0.9368,1.0155,0.7402,3.2141,5.6579,6.743,0.8563,13.5594,4.5612,0.0869,0.977,1.4094,2.6243,1.9266,0.651,4.4113,0.5753,2.6834,2.8032,1.428,4.3129,1.8923,0.735,4.9549,4.3526,0.0086,0.4153,4.1912,0.5152,2.5478,4.1211,0.0169,2.7629,0.3569,2.5277,1.5975,4.7009,0.8112,0.6348,2.4445,2.8026,5.665,1.6442,2.0359,5.7181,1.2626,3.9651,0.4884,5.1465,1.3854,2.8502,5.6855,0.0066,0.7214,0.169,1.8554,2.2861,2.6468,5.9218,1.8344,4.9135,1.0549,5.311,3.3266,5.9231,2.8043,1.6413,1.7918,8.8417,0.4802,5.358,0.0037,0.0604,2.452,0.0042,0.3408,1.3034,4.2842,0.2774,5.1582,0.1205,3.2733,0.8408,1.9164,1.797,1.2161,3.7387,0.369,6.7277,2.116,2.3345,1.1762,1.7915,0.848,3.7383,6.0308,1.4448,5.295,0.6559,2.2733,2.1729,1.6445,4.0486,6.2854,0.3546,1.8254,0.0449,0.2327,3.8726,1.509,4.7774,0.002,0.5686,4.6745,2.7169,3.5586,0.1855,5.4325,2.2609,3.0147,0.2411,0.0065,2.5342,3.0761,1.1544,0.5856,1.5081,3.3864,2.5067,2.5105,0.413,3.1971,1.6333,1.8374,0.0522,0.1386,2.1722,3.4897,1.8392,0.0315,2.027,2.019,6.4158,0.5053,3.0302,2.9964,1.9835,0.303,2.9248,0.0054,0.4198,1.7308,2.7442,1.7992,4.8028,0.457,5.517,3.3667,3.848,2.6626,5.8323,1.9079,5.8435,5.916,1.1731,0.0177,2.3548,2.266,2.9243,3.7611,6.302,0.7884,0.1989,3.9812,1.0297,3.3835,0.3695,0.7267,0.9545,4.2796,0.0047,1.5295,0.1448,0.2595,2.1041,2.4337,5.9457,0.1799,1.7657,0.2742,2.7388,0.0051,3.4785,4.1892,0.077,0.5302,0.8307,1.4169,4.1539,0.0129,5.6208,0.6903,0.3704,2.6862,3.469,3.4142,0.0079,1.7834,3.8964,2.8701,1.9649,2.3476,4.9468,0.7564,1.3201,1.0896,1.4126,4.4074,1.123,0.6917,4.5382,1.4318,1.51,4.8983,4.3383,3.7222,3.9397,1.9953,3.9104,4.8428,1.8145,0.3932,2.6606,3.803,6.4842,4.197,0.2355,4.0425,3.2272,0.2717,3.672,0.167,0.3614,1.7466,1.3492,6.2976,0.9015,6.6754,3.7916,0.2098,2.6331,2.6647,1.817,2.8388,0.0238,0.2778,2.7055,0.7662,5.2517,4.3272,0.84,0.9473,5.5513,2.8709,2.6325,1.661,4.3808,0.1845,2.4757,5.6939,0.0506,0.0041,0.0023,0.4555,2.2713,0.9175,3.2824,0.0343,2.7117,0.1155,0.0022,1.8652,1.3186,2.9654,0.5351,0.5465,6.288,3.3331,1.3242,0.0573,0.3737,4.992,0.1055,0.0029,1.8803,2.0505,0.6277,4.3445,2.6202,3.441,0.0016,1.6939,0.1676,3.124,3.2667,0.7686,5.5341,1.8645,1.5768,1.5002,1.8525,0.0525,0.0136,6.6528,1.2577,1.3108,4.6897,0.5923,0.6669,0.0029,0.0063,1.2194,4.1278,0.4322,3.8682,0.053,0.3455,0.9273,1.5765,7.0745,0.5033,5.9943,5.0411,0.381,1.5832,1.907,1.622,2.7107,2.9347,3.5756,2.8712,3.0657,4.3026,1.0623,1.2361,1.1296,0.5431,4.3514,0.0836,1.5839,0.9797,4.3995,5.2968,0.445,2.5341,1.9553,5.1823,4.9066,1.737,1.8698,0.9163,1.5235,3.4541,6.9836,0.0015,0.2712,0.1618,2.6953,0.5832,4.285,0.0003,3.2901,4.4664,4.8166,6.1665,2.9752,0.1478,1.8838,0.1192,0.7799,2.2966,1.9528,0.2034,3.2922,2.8092,1.9981,1.6206,3.2802,1.8983,2.3691,2.3925,0.0618,0.003,0.0004,0.8265,4.9752,0.6857,5.8073,4.0522,3.7588,2.3511,5.4634,4.0763,1.5013,0.1294,1.5315,4.1498,3.5903,5.3471,0.1795,2.41,1.7135,0.0004,1.6421,0.4855,3.585,2.196,3.2883,3.3044,5.4912,4.3609,0.7221,6.456,3.7899,1.5181,2.299,2.4031,0.0006,0.0477,0.2529,0.7411,2.0882,1.4473,3.0864,1.947,0.9847,0.2565,2.8934,3.7946,4.5558,1.1495,0.6992,1.7493,1.8498,5.7354,2.035,1.6705,2.4091,0.9181,3.8532,1.8115,1.8792,4.8361,0.8912,0.5978,5.7531,3.8135,5.9495,0.0278,4.2291,1.1364,1.8556,0.0003,0.0002,5.9514,0.2354,2.4345,3.1343,0.4748,2.3499,1.6221,1.8857,0.748,0.9445,2.5224,0.7709,1.3135,1.6498,1.7885,4.1742,0.9707,4.1714,0.41,0.9127,2.2748,0.9604,5.7764,1.2037,2.5057,0.1299,0.9138,3.3156,0.8046,2.5539,0.5798,3.8751,0.0619,0.0282,2.3896,0.1891,0.1139,1.8131,1.3063,0.5071,2.617,0.0075,0.0756,6.0591,2.4709,2.7987,0.8863,0.436,3.4874,1.9377,0.6299,1.1534,6.0257,2.2867,6.0621,5.1309,4.1699,1.8333,1.4718,2.5489,3.1033,3.1319,0.3014,0.3827,5.7675,5.358,3.8242,0.5964,1.657,2.6221,2.6084,0.5347,0.0948,2.9131,0.007,0.7648,0.3888,1.4443,5.6295,3.2559,4.9571,0.5916,1.62,0.6015,0.9306,0.4259,1.6941,3.179,1.7265,5.1164,1.8332,0.0015,0.0001,0.9584,5.1103,3.1392,0.0019,0.0002,0.2704,2.1576,5.5962,1.0054,0.57,4.2001,0.0126,0.1299,0.7192,1.1077,2.1455,2.3947,2.2884,2.0787,6.0332,0.3489,2.048,4.9093,4.5323,2.5346,1.1057,3.0454,2.0374,1.6333,1.1651,3.1682,0.0153,0.1687,0.7868,0.1995,3.1816,2.3387,2.9119,4.0434,1.3546,2.2557,0.0436,5.1172,6.1163,5.6092,6.6794,0.5191,4.3782,0.7961,0.4518,0.0195,3.3033,4.4001,1.1095,2.6585,4.6263,0.0199,0.0975,0.0775]}

His career began well as he was named the Player of the Season for 2010 in the National Soccer League with the Newcastle Jets and was the MVP for the 2007 \u2013 08 season.\n\nFowler's early success with the Jets led to him being selected for the Socceroos for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn 2006-07 he was nominated for Hyundai A-League Player of the Year and the NSW All-Stars for Best XI. On 11 December 2006 Fowler scored his first A-League goal for North Queensland against Perth Glory in a 2-2 draw at Coopers Stadium, which led to his long-awaited debut.\n\nFowler's form in 2008 led to him being named as the Player of the Season in the A-League and the winner of the inaugural John Marsden Medal. As part of his international duty he played in the 2007 FIFA World Cup, where his form earned him selection for Australia's 23-man squad for the 2007 FIFA World Cup. In 2007-08 he led his club to a Hyundai A-League premiership, when they held off Western Sydney Wanderers at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Fowler's form earned him the inaugural Captain's Medal at the start of the 2009-10 season. At the conclusion of the 2009-10 season Fowler had scored 18 goals in 26 appearances and had accumulated over 250 minutes of A-League action.\n\nHis form dipped slightly over the 2010-11 season and he was sold to Melbourne Victory on 30 June 2012.\n\nFowler announced himself as a household name during the 2012 NSL season after he led his Melbourne Victory team to an historic championship, a season which featured their maiden Socceroo Player of the Year award. Following the arrival of Marco Rojas in January 2012, Fowler's form was so stellar, the Socceroos coach, Ange Postecoglou, elected to leave his striker with the Socceroos squad for the group fixtures during the first two World Cup qualifiers.\n\nAfter an injury-interrupted 2013-14 season, Fowler featured for Victory at the World Cup, and was named Player of the Match against Colombia in their 1 \u2013 1 draw.

{"id":2643,"ended":true,"length":566,"gen_text":"The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for entry. The list of disabilities is below:\n\n\nFemininity of body\n\nThe Paralympics is all about gender equality, although those wearing the 'female' shirt have to play a part in the sport. In order to compete as a woman you need to have crossed over and had your hormones manipulated.\n\nIt is a very high physical and mental pressure job. However, it is also a source of much pride to have been nominated by your peers. When you make your way to the Paralympics you never know who is looking at you!\n\nYou will also be competing against men and women who have had the same treatments and treatments as you.\n\nIt has to be said that the women with the less severe disabilities have a great deal to celebrate too!\n\nDisabilities can be physical or intellectual, there is no such thing as the difference between a paraplegic and a quadriplegic!! This may sound shocking but in any event you need to get on with your life in a way that is acceptable to the whole disabled community.\n\nDisabled athletes will often use their sport as a means of meeting others, this creates friendships and makes life livable.\n\nThe IPC do not provide 'counseling' programmes for disabled athletes. That is up to you. The IPC has no knowledge of whether or not that the disabled athlete is 'fit' to participate.\n\n\nSport and disability will only become a topic of conversation when the games are over, after the Games have passed. The Paralympics will continue to bring in billions of pounds of revenue for the Olympic and Paralympic movement and in the long run the money flow will ensure that money is spent on developing society's best and brightest.\n\n\nThese facts will help dispel the myth that Paralympic spectators are out to get the disability athlete, many of these Paralympic spectators are just like you, we could be friends, have a cup of tea or a chat on a crowded bus.\n\nOn your journey you may hear the famous phrase 'What are you doing here?' When you arrive, you should smile and answer: \"I just want to enjoy one of the most exciting moments in my life.\"\n\n\nAll Paralympic athletes will return home with a medal. The IPC aim to have a medal tally of 100 by 2024. This will be achieved despite some of the Paralympic sports being less expensive than the major events.\n\nYou will be on the front page of the newspapers, radio and on our TV screens. The only time that Paralympic athletes are invisible is when they are not visible.\n\nThe media will show you and your medals, this will not distract you, everyone will be interested to see how they compare to others from other sports!\n\nIf you are interested in receiving support from the IPC, we would be very grateful if you could contact us for information.","token_len":637,"entropy":[7.7605,4.7459,3.9571,5.4587,8.0861,8.9672,1.4052,1.502,2.0584,3.759,0.7639,3.5238,0.2026,3.8714,1.9877,2.6595,0.8801,10.4294,0.0064,1.4712,3.8055,1.0484,0.4235,1.7183,1.9294,1.3053,1.0712,1.2825,0.7734,0.0001,0.8286,7.8692,2.8107,6.0578,3.8494,2.6339,4.6316,2.6432,5.4203,1.5712,2.3497,4.9231,0.7009,3.2321,1.2806,2.9006,1.3393,3.1717,0.0003,5.8725,4.9974,2.2088,3.5598,2.6996,1.7713,0.0002,4.0898,3.6671,0.0004,0.8862,1.995,4.5346,0.0428,3.9245,0.228,1.5278,6.017,6.0585,6.1786,1.0808,3.9735,0.9729,0.0406,5.2938,2.7078,1.1604,3.9852,2.2511,4.573,0.5119,0.8859,2.3463,1.3795,3.3801,1.9114,0.1355,1.1362,2.4736,0.4165,0.9476,2.1261,1.8666,0.1058,1.5576,6.3133,1.7837,4.5423,4.6205,1.9955,3.9296,5.4273,0.9858,2.6898,0.0002,4.9264,0.8586,2.4676,3.3923,4.7161,4.0417,1.2633,0.233,3.2857,4.3062,1.8115,4.9271,0.2614,2.0811,0.5859,2.0513,0.88,5.245,0.0061,4.0886,0.4878,1.8833,2.7372,2.5186,3.752,2.6994,0.6247,0.9964,1.376,5.085,1.2725,4.9198,1.8032,2.4483,1.0132,0.2072,1.6526,0.0003,0.3029,1.4103,6.0051,0.6322,1.2639,1.8357,4.0239,0.7335,0.0869,3.7786,0.8292,0.0002,3.861,1.9671,2.327,1.3628,1.527,0.7663,2.7421,1.4332,0.1482,1.0196,0.796,2.2243,1.8911,0.6339,4.1091,1.6661,5.1097,1.3478,0.0419,0.7372,1.9437,0.0002,3.5616,4.289,2.6804,0.0674,0.7319,0.5336,1.7873,3.783,2.9752,1.6574,4.864,1.3491,0.8239,2.0939,1.9675,2.5028,0.2957,1.9569,3.5215,2.7844,1.8924,0.9789,0.0002,4.2278,1.993,3.6281,1.2513,1.9268,1.0726,3.0653,1.5813,4.2546,0.6296,0.2686,2.3968,0.0151,0.0113,4.259,5.5433,0.1412,1.1448,3.2962,0.0007,0.0067,0.1311,0.3812,0.406,0.0264,0.0002,0.0003,0.0004,6.7688,5.1964,5.0698,1.8088,3.5628,1.0239,3.4204,6.5786,2.8249,2.5985,2.9516,0.1228,3.8689,2.2376,0.1083,1.0854,1.0795,4.0576,2.0981,2.033,0.2123,1.2915,3.1438,0.1486,1.5947,5.9751,5.2763,0.0419,0.4703,0.691,0.0002,3.3076,2.7222,2.0332,3.1723,3.4231,4.1831,1.6105,4.629,0.6516,0.2724,1.8055,0.6296,4.8266,3.3233,2.8961,4.2617,6.2225,1.5687,0.7019,4.0752,3.0148,6.6377,0.0035,0.7492,0.9529,0.0002,2.4419,3.1667,0.0007,5.6879,0.373,4.3885,5.0423,4.2914,1.9442,1.5142,0.1552,0.1654,5.9836,0.8827,0.8782,0.2214,1.1769,5.4404,0.5575,1.5025,0.0091,1.6112,1.4031,2.9145,0.8621,0.0007,3.7037,3.2895,4.7784,0.2549,4.3415,2.0244,0.0081,5.9921,4.341,2.5397,0.8381,1.0072,3.6384,2.2206,1.2531,0.4998,2.5793,1.0864,2.972,0.0003,5.0111,2.2194,1.7926,6.1626,5.4926,2.9461,1.4141,3.0775,0.2747,1.5964,1.2211,1.8901,5.4144,0.7962,0.3056,2.2855,3.6054,1.2636,4.4696,1.7343,2.9058,1.6355,2.6154,0.5268,0.0003,0.2188,2.4176,3.3277,0.6272,3.7288,3.7738,3.9545,0.1544,0.5928,1.8632,2.2382,1.2781,0.2572,4.7778,2.5784,0.0061,0.0001,0.0079,1.8031,1.9096,4.8264,1.5707,1.7335,0.7613,1.7873,4.371,6.9065,0.3733,3.4826,0.5047,6.3647,0.9233,1.0207,0.5566,4.3476,6.5826,1.9833,3.8581,1.6476,0.1811,1.0455,1.299,0.0003,5.891,4.5587,2.3169,1.5946,4.6606,0.9198,1.1431,0.1656,2.6737,0.001,1.1666,7.2278,0.6884,5.2469,0.7225,2.6502,1.317,5.4785,0.6994,2.2505,3.6152,1.1529,2.3586,3.1992,0.0014,0.6439,0.4506,0.6762,2.8961,2.3548,0.8804,1.1089,5.5236,6.1793,2.0163,1.5515,1.5064,3.8031,1.6202,2.484,0.0072,0.1026,1.6074,1.0957,1.5544,3.2492,1.7358,3.6817,1.4513,1.0095,1.1803,0.0002,5.7716,3.7127,1.3147,3.1657,1.9167,4.7454,2.7739,5.7674,1.6421,1.1066,4.9151,3.033,0.2709,1.2706,1.3744,0.5968,4.9709,0.7631,3.1522,3.8832,1.4361,3.8359,3.4704,0.4798,2.8535,3.2237,1.3124,0.5168,3.7747,1.2969,0.0291,2.0452,6.3776,0.2798,0.1794,1.4776,2.3604,3.6889,0.735,0.4115,0.0578,1.3832,1.3915,0.0003,5.241,2.0281,0.0007,0.2843,0.7632,2.3612,5.4458,0.7431,1.4565,1.0941,2.5251,2.2923,2.3404,2.4886,0.0005,5.1221,0.5059,1.7353,2.0384,1.9693,2.9929,0.3196,2.724,2.0322,3.8002,0.5676,3.4188,1.7963,0.9032,1.1594,4.6993,4.3967,2.454,0.0945,3.6595,0.0006,0.3478,2.674,1.2915,3.0697,6.1425,0.9151,1.6737,4.7411,3.4746,1.2574,1.1079,0.0002,3.6163,1.15,1.5868,5.4885,1.4562,1.4127,0.6665,0.0378,0.85,1.0755,1.3589,5.3261,0.3505,2.5825,6.5291,1.3682,0.1741,1.3586,2.3055,5.5719,3.6485,2.4443,1.6075,0.0005,0.2994,1.0053,1.4352,4.7419,0.2654,0.2842,0.3677,0.4988,0.8424,4.7615,0.6441,1.1721,0.0002,1.9192,4.5338,1.6268,4.2538,0.8779,3.4425,0.9887,3.5951,1.7542,3.7247,1.3212,3.7901,5.2103,0.5136,2.6384,6.6063,0.8565,1.1727,2.6778,2.6602,0.7069,1.9556,4.6933,1.3629,0.4341,2.7318,4.2198,2.6024,2.8921,3.4865,0.8485,0.0002,3.2562,0.1857,1.1172,2.9308,0.0701,5.397,3.8964,1.5886,0.4707,0.6499,0.0006,1.4292,3.4399,1.45,0.7958,2.5709,0.9797,0.6033,0.0131,0.8586,1.8285,0.6728,3.5607,2.4073,1.5654]}
{"id":2931,"ended":true,"length":600,"gen_text":"DNA replication is for the most part extremely accurate, however errors ( mutations ) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10 \u2212 8 per nucleotide per base pair in the nucleus, and between 5% and 98% of genetic errors occur in DNA in other cells. Many mistakes are also present across the genome.\nAn error in gene sequence, a mutation, could change the expression of that gene, make it ineffective, or even stop it working altogether. The cell can also go on to remove the faulty sequence from the genome, at which point it is termed a \"disease-causing error\". This process of correcting or eliminating an error is called \"reprogramming\".\nThe genome is also continuously mutating, with new mutations being generated at a rate of one or more per hour. As a result more than 80% of the genes in the living organism are continuously undergoing evolutionary change. In recent years, scientists have estimated that the number of human genes will fall from 8,000 at the end of the last Ice Age to 3,000 some 20 000 years from now.\nThe genome is the collection of all the molecules and genetic information on which the individual cells and organisms, like the human being, are based. Mutations are very common, however, they are very rare in the complete set of genes, which is currently around 1,500 genes.\nThe genome is divided into approximately 3 billion \"comprising\" 3 million genes. That means that there are 3*3 = 30 billion genes in the human body that are constantly mutating. That's a lot of randomness. But for a cell to evolve, it must make the very best use of the mutations, and only then the evolution can occur. In other words, there needs to be enough mutations to compensate for the errors, which is where the concept of purifying selection comes into play.\nIt is extremely challenging to accurately track mutation rates and ascertain whether or not there is enough genetic variation over a given period of time in order to sustain evolutionary changes. An even more important aspect is to account for any chance changes that could have been introduced accidentally over billions of years of population genetics.\nThere is absolutely no question that purifying selection can play a major role in sustaining evolution. In fact, as you will see, some of my previous posts were just that: posts about purifying selection. However, purifying selection is just a very simple way of describing how evolution works. I thought many of you would want to know about the real power of purifying, selective selection. I also thought you might not be able to believe that the actual application of purifying selection is not as simple as it seems and requires far more knowledge to grasp the concept. One of my recent posts was a response to all of these misconceptions.\u00a0\nIt also might interest many of you to know that purifying selection was actually not the first way of generating adaptive changes to a species. The ancestors of the human race used a number of different mechanisms to control gene expression.\nFor a more detailed description of purifying selection I suggest you visit this article.","token_len":637,"entropy":[7.3831,2.9279,8.0889,1.3379,1.5183,0.0027,5.9405,4.6885,1.2158,4.7538,5.0549,5.3614,7.7212,0.3685,2.2783,0.3039,1.066,2.2133,3.6802,0.1511,2.5626,4.9416,0.0224,0.0005,0.364,1.5286,3.4936,0.3401,1.4471,2.1072,0.0094,3.1542,3.7614,4.9723,0.6206,3.4112,0.0195,0.667,1.3152,0.133,3.2774,1.5311,1.7388,1.4787,1.7014,4.6747,2.8684,3.5208,0.0858,7.6653,0.0149,0.7339,4.6359,0.8566,2.2266,0.6663,2.7204,4.2954,4.7427,1.7244,0.8146,4.994,5.8106,1.1854,4.7465,4.3814,8.1289,0.4937,0.8063,1.6832,2.4212,10.7422,1.0337,1.3873,4.3007,2.9793,3.1564,3.4377,1.4874,0.6092,4.447,4.0848,0.4037,3.038,0.2177,3.6912,0.129,1.2086,6.2691,0.7769,3.878,0.7271,0.1404,1.8666,4.4324,0.5692,0.9218,1.5555,0.1078,2.6159,5.1435,1.737,2.6911,5.2929,1.6862,0.3638,5.5249,0.6659,2.8001,1.8198,1.9243,0.2564,0.9186,1.02,5.4422,0.2148,0.05,1.3553,1.1403,4.0755,0.3337,1.9987,4.3259,0.227,0.0151,1.1938,0.2256,0.0296,3.0913,0.9902,3.2593,1.7137,1.9455,2.439,4.1716,2.3304,2.042,0.0566,0.7511,0.4477,0.8541,2.5822,1.929,0.0081,0.5173,1.1883,1.9886,3.8248,1.0704,2.8669,4.5818,3.7495,0.352,1.182,2.4631,1.9746,0.7165,1.7134,1.9845,1.7915,0.6272,0.6857,0.3023,3.7734,4.0896,1.3217,1.5453,3.4423,0.4411,3.8216,1.1944,0.2611,7.9048,0.7886,4.1038,0.0941,0.0246,0.8836,2.1381,0.4728,0.5709,6.8068,1.2272,0.4,3.4078,2.2177,4.187,0.3506,0.361,3.5866,5.7459,0.1594,0.7668,2.5886,0.0712,5.4951,0.1349,1.5368,2.5932,0.0175,3.9776,0.3448,3.6505,5.2963,2.0353,4.7651,0.5037,0.3246,3.0578,0.5759,2.4436,0.0019,0.1039,1.0987,0.5457,0.0105,0.1466,3.2329,0.0053,0.3662,7.6246,3.6976,2.4638,0.0198,0.2795,0.0276,0.3329,0.7869,1.7508,2.7669,0.9106,2.957,4.3604,0.0041,0.9891,0.5104,5.6088,2.4988,2.9179,0.5885,6.2208,0.7577,1.4122,3.9061,2.014,2.0318,0.779,3.6593,3.758,1.9137,0.9364,2.2245,0.0753,0.7624,1.253,0.1162,5.766,0.0231,1.871,5.4808,1.1129,1.6516,3.5395,1.4592,2.116,0.6018,3.3099,0.6407,0.4033,0.7759,4.763,2.8394,0.0189,1.461,2.4909,1.5505,1.3346,5.5204,3.4476,1.7593,1.2796,1.6667,2.0462,0.5338,1.3286,1.6354,1.8935,0.8514,3.5253,0.0823,4.4695,1.4475,0.8611,3.6119,5.5898,3.1126,1.4026,4.3141,4.0382,1.6433,0.8895,5.6257,1.3927,0.5501,1.559,0.0776,1.6243,6.4556,1.6339,2.4005,3.1369,1.9849,1.2472,0.5784,0.2961,0.6003,2.3149,5.6751,0.9758,4.2979,3.293,0.001,0.6415,3.705,1.7699,1.2024,0.4483,0.1527,3.3222,1.3867,1.6624,4.4053,5.3806,2.2958,2.0143,0.5576,3.8028,0.6813,0.9349,1.3434,2.9101,2.4102,6.6181,0.1276,0.559,0.0133,1.173,2.0652,3.254,1.6567,4.7277,1.4776,5.3817,5.4759,1.3827,1.704,0.0688,3.7732,1.4554,0.009,0.0951,3.3032,3.9608,0.0046,0.0055,3.1716,2.9083,0.9128,4.8817,0.0639,0.5987,2.8423,1.8751,2.5287,1.2797,3.7217,0.8931,2.0726,0.0219,4.5409,0.0136,0.0262,0.1094,1.4181,0.1556,0.0623,0.2545,4.1,0.6217,5.8823,4.9038,0.2526,4.6588,4.4088,3.9291,0.5907,2.1948,4.2858,2.2301,1.9136,0.0049,2.6914,0.7368,2.7746,2.3992,1.4564,6.2831,2.2442,3.2583,1.8938,0.1777,0.0166,2.8997,0.7515,0.3513,3.2582,3.0606,2.7815,0.3316,5.2991,4.7952,0.6503,3.2976,3.1402,1.1508,1.4684,5.6486,0.0141,3.9468,4.9761,3.9155,0.7988,2.8797,1.8495,2.5841,1.1829,4.4984,3.6218,4.4781,0.0154,0.0146,1.3748,6.354,5.6252,0.3877,0.7796,3.3908,1.2065,6.1496,0.058,4.2378,0.1745,3.6782,0.0081,0.0129,2.8612,1.9043,0.2848,2.0146,0.0642,0.0417,3.8817,1.7367,0.6276,2.7164,0.732,0.1172,4.7768,3.6509,1.1209,0.3068,1.6347,4.5093,0.9279,5.0408,3.8714,1.487,4.1197,5.3557,2.4206,1.9015,2.0397,1.7311,1.2325,0.0052,0.0031,0.5939,3.1867,0.0419,2.6619,0.0039,0.0034,0.7362,3.8936,3.2129,2.3318,2.0932,2.2427,0.4118,1.9396,2.4817,1.5901,0.9586,0.5821,3.274,5.6715,6.1712,1.1523,0.4608,0.5085,3.5083,0.3139,0.6043,1.9887,2.3377,4.487,4.6436,0.1631,0.22,0.0014,9.7692,2.5989,0.8661,0.9599,2.9343,2.6125,0.9256,1.9548,0.9115,5.2213,1.6703,2.0578,0.0143,2.7479,0.9283,2.4747,5.1257,5.41,0.0987,0.3859,0.0039,0.0362,1.4153,2.1792,2.3324,0.5497,0.1084,0.9105,1.2046,4.4272,3.9819,4.4444,0.0569,2.6408,4.0399,2.9541,2.3974,1.9241,0.4581,6.6092,0.8011,1.964,3.3054,0.2544,1.6351,2.5931,3.1007,0.0129,5.9906,1.4453,2.6263,2.4574,0.6583,4.3196,0.3221,4.0498,5.0828,4.7077,3.3181,4.6254,0.1112,0.0247,0.3135,0.1141,0.0712,1.2239,0.0039,0.0253,3.0724,2.7289,4.3967,1.8932,0.5223,2.2631,1.5407,4.5899,3.8203,1.9039,2.1108,1.3538,1.8136,0.3455,2.1625,5.5584,0.0432,1.6485,1.428,2.5768,3.335,1.1445,2.196,0.004,1.0923,1.825,0.6986,5.4204,3.6195,0.4578,1.1482,2.5487,3.885,2.6957,2.3972,0.7306,2.7544,0.1495,0.7841,0.0053,0.0564,4.3076,1.6699,0.4682,3.1202,2.1328,2.6787,2.393]}
{"id":996,"ended":false,"length":490,"gen_text":"Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 6 and rapidly intensified in the upper troposphere until landfall on September 10.\n\nThe storm formed as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The storm was expected to produce wind speeds near 140 mph.\n\nHurricane Janet had been on track for its strongest winds during early September. The storm produced strong winds along its eastern edge, reaching 120 mph on August 15.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the Florida Keys, with tropical storm force winds potential. While a watch is not a hurricane, hurricane conditions could develop with a potential for sustained winds of 75 mph or more.\n\nWith tropical storm force winds possible, the hurricane has the potential to cause life-threatening storm surge flooding and dangerous storm surge flooding during the next 48 hours. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center and tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 140 miles from the center. Hurricane-force winds can also extend outward up to 110 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds can extend outward up to 165 miles from the center.\n\nHurricane winds extend outward up to 55 miles from the center of the center. The average maximum wind speed is 74 mph.\n\nThe maximum sustained wind speed is near 85 mph.\n\nHurricane winds extend outward up to 40 miles from the center. The average maximum wind speed is near 70 mph.\n\nThe maximum sustained wind speed is near 82 mph.\n\n\nForecast Track\n\nHurricane Janet will bring significant, life-threatening disruption during the next 48 hours. The center of the storm is expected to pass directly over the Florida Keys on September 10, producing a dangerous storm surge as high as 4 to 6 feet. The storm's track may shift westward later that day, increasing the likelihood of storm surge flooding. The storm will continue traveling through the Mississippi River Delta region through Monday. Additionally, the storm is expected to impact Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Cuba through early next week.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center's 5 PM EDT track forecast (above) indicates storm track change.\n\nThe forecast track change is based on current modeling of the storm's progress.

{"id":740,"ended":false,"length":550,"gen_text":"Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the end of the season. He would be taken by the Liverpool club to Scunthorpe in June 1936, where he would also play a part in the FA Cup Final in April 1937.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that he had been invited to play for Liverpool before his first game. He had also played for the Liverpool club on three previous occasions where he made three appearances. He had played for the club on three separate occasions when he was 17 years old; all of which were in the Football Association youth sides.\n\nIn 1934\/35, he played with the Liverpool A XI against Bolton Wanderers Reserves, at the same time he played for the reserve team at the same club, which was known as the Liverpool U 18's. He would make the first team squad and spend the season as a left back, however there was a problem with the Liverpool U 18's, so Liverpool B XI would see his debut in the FA Cup Final.\n\nIn the club's first competitive match for the 1934\/35 season, he started as a left back, although he was very unhappy with the way he was being used and after the game, he was transferred back to the right wing. He had then moved into the Liverpool U 18's, where he was then sent to the West Midlands Training Centre in Birmingham where the Liverpool Academy was based in 1934\/35.\n\nIn 1935, he went out training with the Liverpool U 18's for a couple of weeks, and in 1934 he also started with the reserve team, then as a left back, for the Liverpool U 18's. In this game against Sunderland Reserves U18's, his centre back partner George Kelly was injured, but he could not be replaced, and despite the setback he managed to play a part in the FA Cup Final against Sheffield United.\n\nHe scored his first Liverpool goal in this FA Cup Final, having been put wide left by Paul Clements.

{"id":1048,"ended":true,"length":582,"gen_text":"Manuscript illumination continued into the late Middle Ages, moving from elaborate gospels to charters, like that confirming the rights of Kelso Abbey from 1159. Very little painting from Scottish churches survives.\nBishop St. Dunstan's Church of St. David's at Brora contains a mural with images of Christ on the Cross and figures wearing the tunic of the Blessed Virgin.\nThe St. Andrews Cathedral near St. Andrews is one of four Scottish churches that produced great painters. The painting to the left was created on the site of St. Andrews' church from 578-579.\nThe magnificent St. Mary's church in Borth was built in 928 by Abbot St. Hugh of Lincoln. It is known for its frescoes with Madonna and Child, and a number of paintings of saints.\nIn 935, St. Columba created the painting in the North aisle of this church, entitled \"The Baptizing of Jesus Christ.\" He is seen kneeling beside Christ.\nThe church, known as St. Columba's Church, was probably commissioned by some of the other monasteries in the nearby settlement, for a grand dedication in which the church was transformed from its small chapel. St Columba is also the inspiration for Santa Claus (in Finland Saint Hanno). The story goes that one day, some monks went out to the village on the border of Lappland and went around looking for a house with an inn, where the man dressed as Saint Columba would get paid the same as a fisherman. The place was a good inn as they had never seen anyone dressed up as Santa Claus. But the man at the next door had dressed as the Blessed Virgin, so the other visitors went away happy. But the woman who was dressed as St. Columba returned home with her clothes and went straight to her bed where upon she began to sing. She didn't realize that the doors to her home were always closed. Her husband went out on Christmas Eve and found the bed empty. After he opened the door she had fallen asleep and he was terrified that the door might still be locked. The next day he went out again; but, it was full of snow and he could not enter the house at all. The next day he returned with some straw and put it on the bed, and it was empty. Then he saw a strange image of one of the old women in the courtyard and the old man who lived there. He saw that the woman had made a new straw coat over her old coat. As she spoke her son who, by this time, had returned from work, asked what she needed. The woman smiled and said that her son had found that there was no snow so she could not come outside again for fear of being frostbitten. The image of St. Columba was discovered during the reconstruction of the church.\nThere is another saint living in the monastery (if not in the church) that is a good influence for Santo Domingo saint - Maria la Hiremilla, who helped the sailors of the Portuguese squadron to find a new island in the 16th century.","token_len":638,"entropy":[5.5608,10.0436,8.3969,3.1463,0.2666,2.5312,3.6686,0.0102,0.9682,8.4523,1.0558,7.6653,5.3871,6.8382,1.181,10.5636,1.1085,1.6539,7.0123,3.2158,12.6629,0.5468,4.566,0.1429,13.3923,4.2169,3.8828,6.2178,5.3775,1.5712,1.473,7.8885,1.6161,7.5453,4.6097,10.1986,3.3233,1.3491,2.3409,1.3517,9.5693,1.8983,4.8127,1.4256,3.773,0.0011,1.2494,4.2921,2.0417,1.0867,0.0482,3.8326,0.3666,2.9717,4.1031,3.7266,0.0395,5.8669,1.143,5.0466,3.7846,5.1398,0.2782,3.1808,3.6424,0.0688,1.1161,0.8855,6.562,6.117,1.793,4.4551,0.1467,0.4511,1.0791,3.0233,0.0933,1.2852,1.9901,1.5874,4.0959,0.1587,3.2128,1.0038,6.1511,2.5094,0.6375,0.0168,1.9331,2.5273,0.0217,5.6747,2.5673,0.7925,1.6322,5.9268,4.9621,2.324,0.0005,1.2285,1.2982,4.4322,5.1181,0.0741,0.7561,2.3964,2.8081,5.1299,0.6665,3.5827,0.1825,1.8744,0.0274,1.2553,2.5507,2.848,3.7464,6.279,4.2591,1.2666,3.5855,0.4982,1.7541,1.1441,5.3814,2.6133,0.0495,2.6389,0.4782,3.1104,1.3476,3.8831,3.8096,2.4669,2.4106,0.7876,4.0316,4.5604,1.8286,4.7223,0.0181,3.3429,0.1493,3.6334,0.9674,0.8662,0.6805,1.7327,1.546,3.792,0.4658,0.529,4.2789,0.0235,0.1067,4.5579,6.0968,0.484,0.0917,1.8114,1.709,2.7281,4.6182,0.0238,3.3421,1.2316,2.0609,0.7995,0.6046,3.1536,3.4798,3.8145,0.8783,1.5547,0.012,2.7845,0.1982,5.4126,1.0759,4.2405,3.6005,0.1718,5.7143,1.5643,0.4013,4.3754,0.325,1.9904,4.1688,1.0761,1.0286,4.5653,4.9544,0.0832,3.2784,1.4905,0.9046,3.7691,1.8365,3.8152,2.5769,3.7258,2.1859,2.11,0.8071,1.1786,2.7247,4.8703,3.2933,0.2616,1.2796,0.0405,2.3226,0.0679,0.0507,1.5079,0.3324,0.8976,5.7239,4.6278,0.2772,7.1812,1.3813,0.4738,5.3591,2.9637,0.1681,0.0005,1.1189,0.5471,5.3344,5.5125,2.4062,3.9906,2.8102,5.4434,5.63,3.4863,3.7884,1.2472,2.1838,0.7997,5.0807,2.0974,3.5934,4.3712,2.6625,2.1141,3.431,4.1441,0.032,2.0515,2.4046,2.3213,6.546,0.0992,6.7809,0.3955,4.3454,3.5011,5.7648,6.7659,6.2628,2.9582,2.2741,2.8002,4.6653,1.8521,0.055,4.0199,0.4845,1.4296,5.376,3.507,2.8725,1.9333,0.7134,1.7442,3.4749,4.9686,1.8044,4.0343,0.7409,4.864,0.1897,0.2539,0.3979,6.2173,3.5042,4.5505,0.0266,0.9601,4.1363,1.4652,3.261,5.693,1.9616,2.4096,2.6648,5.027,5.7869,0.8512,1.9779,0.5795,0.0272,0.9088,5.2719,5.8329,5.2752,2.8814,0.4481,1.4982,4.8117,0.337,1.8424,5.3472,1.3941,2.6367,3.5303,3.6375,5.8898,2.9828,1.8543,3.1805,0.5441,1.7757,0.212,2.2633,1.0736,2.0061,0.041,0.7688,4.2816,1.6404,1.3196,4.2542,0.034,6.191,1.1138,2.408,2.8001,1.8233,2.7153,4.3867,0.2232,1.9584,1.3868,1.1793,2.7679,6.7763,3.1549,1.7309,4.7201,0.3518,3.4144,1.1385,4.5275,1.9484,1.5699,1.5973,0.2245,1.2099,0.0104,0.0944,0.0058,4.5102,1.912,2.1957,2.1946,5.0164,2.6826,2.7222,3.5798,0.1692,1.7653,4.182,4.1897,8.3524,0.6817,3.4839,0.3143,2.0535,2.0212,1.9646,4.6222,0.0021,3.3086,0.8197,1.2593,5.9366,2.0335,1.1306,2.046,0.4834,4.4156,3.1973,1.4728,3.7177,1.4772,2.7866,0.8273,4.6886,3.4635,0.3713,1.3198,1.6225,2.1306,4.6697,0.5931,0.5705,4.045,2.3066,3.5634,0.1961,0.2648,3.9331,3.0705,2.2378,0.3101,1.6658,2.4154,2.5308,5.5572,1.2876,2.5986,4.1229,4.1361,5.1093,0.0544,1.0928,0.3617,2.8977,0.4781,0.7218,0.8411,0.6843,1.5307,0.9744,7.5473,1.6075,4.8025,4.1675,0.2054,5.5008,0.0377,0.506,0.9002,0.8992,1.8939,0.3426,4.648,1.6785,0.3429,4.473,0.0372,0.1422,2.1223,0.559,0.3563,0.6025,2.8024,2.1498,3.3717,5.0771,0.592,3.455,0.2384,1.3701,0.2874,1.4664,2.1646,1.2606,2.5587,0.9539,3.4107,0.54,3.0178,0.3643,4.0744,1.572,4.4802,4.2453,1.2184,6.4955,0.6016,0.3298,4.7339,2.012,1.924,0.2023,6.3532,2.2742,3.3552,3.0739,1.5235,2.2483,1.3896,0.3855,1.9918,1.2037,4.2696,1.1799,0.9253,1.8339,1.5475,5.0676,0.7235,4.18,5.1495,4.9701,4.8819,0.5997,0.4281,3.0829,1.6139,4.6925,2.496,4.8415,4.1589,4.963,3.9803,7.4304,2.995,2.7052,0.0235,0.2767,1.0015,4.4093,1.5728,4.1158,0.7742,2.5306,2.5569,1.6013,5.7744,0.5048,1.5865,0.559,5.1224,0.4361,0.6758,1.409,2.6355,0.8484,1.2876,3.4379,4.3347,3.9759,0.2471,1.2142,3.7784,4.2889,1.5619,3.0553,1.1771,3.8758,2.6138,6.4568,4.186,3.1945,0.3885,1.8093,5.9392,0.8324,0.0,0.1476,1.1196,2.9297,1.1368,2.0256,0.0092,0.0849,0.0122,1.5333,5.0081,3.9483,1.2998,2.5786,0.2207,0.1938,0.1971,1.2403,0.7314,4.3241,0.957,2.2132,4.6552,5.5407,0.482,0.9185,3.8231,5.0614,5.5982,2.6497,1.4489,0.3878,0.7943,0.7075,2.9783,1.4938,3.0403,2.6287,4.3916,1.4793,5.9711,1.932,3.3475,0.0143,0.0008,5.6838,5.844,6.5369,5.3426,4.7469,0.8851,5.1767,4.4713,2.1348,1.8311,6.0319,1.5242,6.2557,1.9437,0.8458,4.526,5.2264,2.2873,2.8613,2.12,2.5949,3.338,2.3772,0.4362,5.2142,0.0719,0.0962,0.2696]}
{"id":174,"ended":false,"length":468,"gen_text":"Antimony trioxide ( Sb 4O 6 ) is formed when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, this compound exists as Sb 4O 6, but it polymerizes upon condensing. Other elements in the formula are the elements that give the green colouring of the antimony-containing compounds; nickel ions and copper ions, although those are not actually present in the compound, play a part in the polymerization process.\n\nAlthough these compounds are not of immediate use for chemists, the antimony is used in the manufacture of high-voltage transmission lines. Antimony-based electrical conductors have already been invented and have been used to link two separate terminals of transceivers. This could have a very positive effect for electrically-disabled people, with electrical treatment being possible within a few years or even now.\n\nAntimony-Cobalt-Selenium ( Antimony-Cobalt-Selenium ( SCS ), Antimony-Selenium-Cobalt ( SCS-C ) ) [1]:\n\nAntimony\n\nCobalt\n\nSelenium\n\nis a silver-related compound with a slightly different crystal structure. Antimony-Cobalt-Selenium is one of the most important elements in antimony-containing compounds because it is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust: Antimony is so important in the alloying process that it is rarely found as a by-product in the manufacturing of antimony-containing materials [2]. Antimony-Cobalt-Selenium, however, is present in many antimony compounds that are of great technical importance to many countries, due to its ability to combine with metals to form highly conductive, efficient and stable crystals. In antimony-based materials, antimony-Cobalt-Selenium is a key element in their very long-term stability. For example, if antimony-containing chemicals were to be removed from the manufacturing process, the compounds would not be stable over a period of several thousand years. [2]\n\nBecause of its antimony content, Antimony-Cobalt-Selenium is used in the manufacture of high-voltage transmission lines. SCS-C is used in power grids and electrical distribution lines, and is also frequently used as part of battery electrodes.\n\nAntimony-Nitre is another important metal in the antimony-containing compounds, yet it forms only small quantities in the processes used to manufacture silver. The small antimony content of these compounds is a major reason why they, like SCS-C, are used for electrical components.\n\nAntimony-Sulphur is yet another member of the antimony-containing family, yet it comprises only small quantities in antimony-containing compounds. As all of these compounds are metal-free ( antimony and sulphur being both non-metal elements), they can be used for use in electronics and computer manufacturing, with the possibility of further uses in other industrial and non-industrial sectors in the future.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]","token_len":638,"entropy":[7.1675,7.0558,1.4918,2.4843,7.4432,4.0138,4.3158,7.4365,2.3879,0.2874,1.3487,4.6884,1.6922,6.5355,0.0162,1.8499,8.4149,1.1497,1.5612,1.0228,3.4391,1.5894,5.8456,0.1211,0.5971,2.7362,1.9569,4.6971,0.5441,3.1203,0.079,1.5011,0.2235,0.2232,5.4398,3.2804,2.1063,9.3186,0.0464,3.7634,5.5394,3.2591,2.6705,6.5739,4.4468,2.5673,0.4351,5.7044,1.5217,3.6229,4.1096,1.6391,3.1203,0.9173,5.2293,2.125,2.1877,1.3174,1.1809,2.084,0.0067,3.8144,1.3736,1.6146,4.1819,5.5422,6.6218,2.1083,4.6674,0.1774,3.0868,5.0737,6.0622,1.4585,1.2809,5.4893,0.6483,0.1882,0.5136,2.8819,1.9821,4.5174,0.7646,2.5297,0.225,0.6228,1.1916,0.1118,0.956,0.2303,1.1767,0.0052,4.903,4.381,1.0004,0.6082,2.2994,4.8888,4.4347,1.1397,2.3106,3.3328,0.0581,0.2379,2.3514,3.2037,0.008,3.6679,3.1323,0.8763,1.4227,0.9251,0.0048,4.6297,0.4985,3.1127,0.0038,4.654,0.1506,1.4692,2.715,0.0102,2.7939,2.0604,4.7271,1.5552,0.0443,1.9171,4.4605,0.2064,4.3698,1.3081,2.9404,0.4616,0.938,2.5929,4.7954,3.5549,2.8154,5.5962,0.8991,5.7421,3.5094,0.0044,1.073,3.6696,4.1751,3.5168,1.8441,2.9061,3.2609,1.5528,2.7196,5.6022,0.6956,0.8152,3.5271,0.5282,1.455,5.5804,4.7912,5.1573,1.9564,3.2562,3.8891,0.9385,0.5811,0.6677,5.1464,0.8802,5.0805,0.2509,0.6993,0.0002,2.2113,0.0151,2.1265,6.1382,0.4807,0.0002,1.5282,4.4803,0.0778,1.6474,2.5062,0.2024,0.8003,0.9897,1.0383,0.0008,0.1257,0.4851,0.0234,2.5552,3.9935,0.4458,3.0909,1.688,0.0416,0.5468,2.2637,0.0168,0.7258,0.836,0.0204,0.0001,0.4498,1.4286,0.0511,0.6391,0.3573,1.7305,1.8612,4.9858,2.6901,4.7621,0.5733,0.0002,1.2841,0.0055,4.6723,0.0002,2.155,0.0131,0.0,0.1822,0.0002,0.04,0.0033,0.3392,0.0002,6.0325,0.7855,4.9992,0.254,5.7563,2.1937,2.7073,1.6222,4.4658,1.9627,2.7747,0.0194,1.3262,2.3322,0.0144,1.2438,0.3994,0.031,0.0001,0.1327,0.0183,0.0011,1.4654,3.895,0.0469,0.1179,0.8745,2.0967,2.7523,0.8325,3.6901,0.009,1.0584,0.5309,0.4675,3.1684,0.8388,0.805,1.6541,1.7271,1.9595,0.9849,0.3148,0.8124,2.6283,0.0542,0.0208,5.3184,3.397,0.0032,1.3445,4.8989,3.1965,2.4236,0.9626,6.2376,1.7506,1.696,0.3363,1.1322,0.5721,5.9341,1.4581,2.6139,0.718,1.6613,0.1595,0.0012,1.7768,1.5811,4.5585,0.9513,0.9316,0.0028,0.312,0.1443,3.2342,3.7654,0.4427,0.1406,2.3467,0.0018,0.8531,0.2913,0.0044,0.0,0.0493,0.0073,0.0005,3.5446,2.3974,0.0147,0.5258,3.0224,0.3034,2.9457,1.0026,0.0051,1.3639,3.5764,0.7238,3.7848,2.9631,5.698,1.0526,2.3594,5.1077,2.8581,1.6291,4.4897,0.0467,0.6063,3.432,0.0102,5.3299,0.4297,5.5995,1.2905,0.5272,3.2869,2.4815,0.0054,2.2083,5.0959,1.2313,2.428,4.9424,0.5045,3.5416,3.5981,0.0025,0.456,2.1873,2.619,0.2121,1.9631,0.0034,0.9354,0.3492,0.023,0.0,0.0541,0.0088,0.0004,0.7068,3.1344,2.7846,0.7338,1.2946,4.4924,5.6043,5.1132,0.6384,0.5091,0.4028,0.9947,4.3502,0.6264,0.0245,4.7195,1.2006,0.0006,0.5617,2.6283,4.9965,1.9422,1.1327,0.6514,4.8365,0.1949,0.6445,5.2725,0.6531,0.4474,1.2348,4.9305,0.3209,2.1864,1.2032,2.3579,3.4641,1.2343,1.5123,0.0235,2.1387,2.4618,0.0114,0.7307,4.0802,2.0249,0.138,0.3673,0.0002,4.3704,0.4278,0.4853,4.2483,0.0201,0.668,0.1336,1.9911,0.0029,0.0976,0.0691,0.0009,0.0,0.0127,0.0035,0.0005,0.3802,1.8266,0.6072,0.9941,0.494,0.004,1.5394,0.0846,0.0177,0.0002,0.1437,0.0706,0.6193,6.3129,0.0018,0.8849,0.0284,0.5245,1.4171,0.6615,4.6747,2.8001,1.6936,4.3619,2.9774,2.7985,1.3756,1.1905,1.4372,1.2931,5.9392,0.2537,2.2339,5.0879,0.0017,5.6174,2.1323,0.7438,1.2527,0.0002,1.1888,0.0053,0.9893,5.5271,7.5271,4.4458,2.2688,2.9324,2.7606,1.5765,1.8019,0.7085,0.0006,0.3243,0.0214,0.4547,1.5586,6.3262,0.9637,6.1934,1.4832,2.1774,0.9807,1.3073,0.7757,5.646,2.4895,0.2794,1.7775,7.1837,1.2974,2.9292,3.9227,4.8684,0.0033,1.2185,1.2103,2.5186,0.2454,1.2886,2.9981,2.3013,1.2353,0.5116,0.8221,7.1534,1.8752,1.8683,0.0012,0.1657,0.0045,0.2125,0.3815,1.3243,2.533,1.8692,5.2425,0.7395,0.9553,0.0002,1.2224,0.0067,0.8566,2.7647,1.2798,0.0029,0.1755,0.9114,5.3422,0.0117,5.3638,0.0117,0.1547,0.7766,0.0006,0.5142,0.0132,2.0928,1.1973,2.9951,0.4944,5.9889,0.5828,0.9723,0.3019,0.4973,3.5184,0.0005,0.1476,0.058,0.2294,0.2227,4.3345,6.7163,1.6331,1.5104,0.4591,0.7012,5.1804,0.2916,1.9858,4.2346,5.9888,0.0031,2.4039,0.3672,0.0053,2.4635,2.9685,2.5872,0.057,1.9328,1.028,0.2858,0.9716,2.3491,0.357,0.4946,1.5601,4.1834,0.3462,4.3138,1.8323,5.0004,4.048,2.2365,4.0213,1.0864,3.8851,0.1773,2.8415,3.8727,0.4758,2.2279,3.349,3.694,4.0149,0.0083,0.1522,3.227,2.818,0.0636,0.084,0.0824,0.3299,0.0002,3.0714,2.852,0.1912,0.0031,0.5424,0.0004,2.2981,0.0546,0.0079,0.0001,0.0004]}
{"id":2607,"ended":true,"length":583,"gen_text":"Isaac Newton was born according to the Julian calendar ( in use in England at the time ) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 ( NS 4 January 1643 ), at Woolsthorpe Manor, Suffolk. The birth date is mentioned in the Bible, 1 Kings 15:7; Moses 7:18. In the 13th century, when the Julian Calendar was in use, the birth date could be found on the birth certificate ( NS 1 March 1652 ) of King Henry VIII. In the mid-18th century, the Gregorian Calendar was adopted. King James I used the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nA New Calendar Begins\n\n\nThe first new year (year with one day of the Gregorian Calendar) would begin on 1 January 1752, but it would be one day later than usual, on 22 January 1753. The new year, however, would commence at the same time as the old year with the addition of a new day: 1 January 1754, rather than 22 January 1753. As part of Britain's attempt at unification, King Charles I had tried to impose some form of a new calendar on the entire British Isles, but in vain.\n\nThe first new year would begin on 1 January 1751, when the whole of the United Kingdom (including Scotland) adopted the calendar based on the Gregorian calendar. When the whole of the British Isles adopted the changeable calendar, then, the new year would be on 15 December 1752 (NS 9 January 1753 ) rather than 22 December 1751. It was two days later than usual that the new year began, on 15 December 1752, but this date was later shifted to 1 January 1753 when the whole of Australia changed to the Gregorian Calendar. The date was shifted from Australia to Canada in 1802.\n\n\nThe New Calendar and the Year One\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was used in Ireland and many other countries (as part of the Holy Roman Empire ) until 1752. A year was generally 36*20*30*60*20 days (NS 21 January). An even longer year was used in Wales (72 consecutive days), and in the Middle East (52,300 consecutive days until the Arab Invasion).\n\nOn 1 January 1752, the first year of the new Gregorian Calendar, the world's common year was one leap day: 21 January. This is the only leap day to have occurred since the Gregorian Calendar was adopted on 13 December 1582.\n\nThe New Calendar and the Year Two\n\nThe length of a year is not affected, since the year is the length of the length of a day, that is the number of days between 1st January and 16th January, and so has no effect on the total length of the year. However, two leap years occur for every four years that pass (excepting leap years that fall during years of maximum solar eclipse: this event does not change the cycle of the seasons). The following table shows how leap years occur, and also indicates how many days each one is.\n\nFor a complete list of leap years, see Leap Year (in British English).","token_len":638,"entropy":[2.3948,2.8499,3.3339,2.7025,9.827,0.0062,0.6068,3.9616,0.142,3.1236,10.9326,6.373,1.2761,1.3416,1.9097,0.4931,0.068,2.6297,2.6128,5.9923,0.1704,1.1843,4.2184,0.293,0.6768,0.5086,3.7257,12.7859,6.3507,5.1107,2.1844,0.6572,3.0811,3.6355,3.8622,0.4121,0.0013,0.0009,1.7656,0.71,4.4538,1.2157,2.7531,2.984,1.8423,1.4853,4.9894,0.3464,1.0287,3.7675,1.6139,3.8766,1.4535,3.3932,0.1197,3.2544,4.2777,6.0176,1.8501,0.0135,2.5126,2.0696,3.3054,1.3782,5.1962,0.4808,0.2558,0.6118,3.5811,1.098,1.2409,3.8783,0.334,1.5823,0.2063,0.5463,1.0325,2.0251,0.6831,4.8686,0.6082,1.7177,1.7691,0.6989,5.2082,0.2882,2.4358,1.9673,2.5087,2.4297,0.2758,3.6901,2.1486,1.6442,2.601,1.0771,0.6325,1.0868,2.6497,1.1755,4.5108,0.392,2.1965,0.0117,0.0305,0.1548,0.8862,3.8483,0.0004,0.7334,0.3565,1.3335,2.0062,5.6775,2.0727,0.2816,3.6724,0.3149,0.2716,0.0006,0.2903,2.616,1.9497,0.2065,4.2974,4.8179,3.3605,5.5396,4.9119,0.0002,1.4774,2.9365,4.3853,1.6026,2.9098,2.9893,4.3407,3.5513,1.5582,3.0867,0.6788,2.6834,0.0016,0.4621,0.2212,4.5142,1.1708,0.3288,0.9246,0.1459,2.3431,0.0306,1.2635,3.0961,2.1712,1.7325,1.1788,4.1019,0.8903,1.3064,1.0241,2.197,1.8472,1.7586,4.4198,0.4421,0.6865,0.1983,0.4989,1.4383,2.1277,0.239,3.4839,2.6548,0.0109,0.6982,4.3961,2.6403,1.5922,0.7835,0.1594,0.5615,0.279,0.695,0.6012,5.1633,1.2841,3.406,0.0217,0.952,1.85,0.346,3.1626,2.0218,0.1844,0.3425,0.3261,2.28,2.6691,0.0025,1.1105,0.0242,0.2149,0.2959,0.1833,4.9787,5.0632,0.0015,5.4466,0.0231,3.386,3.0917,3.3829,0.6342,2.3363,3.869,0.6618,3.0052,4.1315,0.3057,2.7664,6.0414,1.524,0.0021,1.4835,1.4883,0.2127,0.5368,0.4891,4.5861,2.45,0.8061,1.1601,0.5022,3.971,1.2542,0.2006,2.2348,0.0002,1.3028,2.9129,2.2923,0.2988,2.2567,0.4541,0.0576,0.0327,0.0021,0.0115,7.2199,0.3232,4.082,0.9235,5.7152,0.5442,1.3168,1.5597,0.0698,2.8242,1.5665,1.5579,0.5393,0.9061,0.1113,3.8225,3.6438,0.0492,0.1548,0.5669,0.0007,1.3472,0.622,5.1853,0.8418,3.2696,0.1475,0.3798,2.0827,0.0442,0.4616,0.1165,7.8858,6.7416,0.3164,0.7218,6.2524,1.678,0.8376,2.0404,0.1127,0.825,2.6505,1.412,5.5762,2.0184,0.5151,0.5774,2.308,3.2098,4.1473,1.3276,0.0301,0.1658,2.9696,1.2671,0.001,0.9095,0.5927,0.0399,0.7213,0.476,4.4729,1.0774,5.8846,0.5177,0.3419,0.6624,0.476,4.5918,1.7767,0.6401,0.0218,0.663,1.4278,0.7657,1.963,0.0726,0.0375,1.065,1.4153,2.2766,2.738,4.9407,0.5882,3.1233,4.7555,0.9042,1.1788,0.062,0.0913,0.1423,3.8313,0.673,0.9522,0.0469,7.636,5.3821,0.7264,0.0922,0.4501,0.0001,0.8788,0.4925,2.1464,3.2493,1.6171,1.3427,3.6532,3.2396,0.3021,3.124,1.1144,0.7791,4.4259,1.0396,3.0286,0.0003,1.1769,2.8831,1.4158,3.8424,0.8663,3.4934,3.7071,2.2597,0.0002,1.0308,2.5324,0.0003,1.3683,1.3241,2.7336,1.1408,4.8522,1.9686,4.2429,0.7621,0.7369,4.1709,4.2061,3.7603,0.0025,0.4711,5.6009,0.1255,0.0068,2.3207,0.9561,2.3258,0.1126,0.8746,4.8492,2.0414,1.9246,4.9716,4.7652,5.3657,4.5439,0.5887,2.1657,0.9884,0.857,0.7041,3.4232,2.2187,2.6215,2.203,4.3823,0.9305,4.44,5.2575,5.2737,1.8687,0.5282,1.1605,1.1278,0.4297,5.5723,1.8445,4.8425,6.0728,0.2713,1.5569,1.476,0.8297,2.0257,4.6906,0.2055,0.6577,5.352,5.5542,5.0127,1.5486,0.0407,7.0458,1.7742,3.758,5.8155,1.8335,1.5933,0.0002,4.4413,1.0011,0.0703,0.2198,0.2637,0.2281,0.8642,2.2713,2.0392,0.528,0.058,0.6852,2.6953,0.0002,0.7428,0.6527,0.7491,4.7371,1.219,6.1802,1.1112,1.56,2.9785,4.7537,1.2558,6.4455,4.2362,0.3932,2.0614,2.0447,3.1635,1.403,3.2752,2.2364,0.7655,3.899,1.4848,0.6603,1.5529,0.4714,1.3501,0.0008,0.694,0.4215,0.7635,3.9127,4.9883,1.0263,0.6391,0.004,0.4613,1.0427,0.0002,1.1341,3.4557,0.5446,0.7976,0.5401,0.5346,0.5108,0.1491,0.0002,0.8321,5.3233,0.0117,0.8752,0.3969,2.2441,2.6372,3.0909,4.2648,3.4264,0.8676,2.7972,0.9179,3.0924,1.9743,0.031,1.2095,4.4864,0.0252,1.4484,1.2822,2.074,5.2898,0.0383,2.9765,1.7461,0.0619,0.8427,2.6649,2.8649,5.295,0.2486,0.1516,7.6369,0.2245,0.545,2.1167,2.1597,2.8142,4.6802,1.3865,0.8886,0.3035,0.2499,5.6118,0.9042,0.0335,0.8788,0.0897,0.1912,2.2789,0.0605,5.7655,1.0596,0.2999,1.2018,4.0964,1.765,1.8274,0.417,2.1306,3.374,3.1762,3.8786,1.11,1.1254,0.0385,2.3779,2.5111,2.8592,3.592,1.0316,4.213,2.1565,1.6294,4.4527,4.1987,5.1462,3.5242,0.1989,3.8647,0.0941,6.1403,0.2909,0.8506,2.43,0.7342,2.3073,4.1665,0.302,0.5979,2.2727,4.1118,0.0866,0.697,3.1923,1.9075,3.6128,3.733,1.951,1.0331,2.0584,2.6176,3.2359,2.6096,1.6642,0.5415,0.0002,6.179,2.6655,2.4081,0.6469,0.0618,1.0723,0.1286,0.6338,0.4248,1.2922,0.9431,5.3448,4.583,4.7926,1.1775,0.4567]}

She was elected Labour borough councillor for Bermondsey in 1989 and was one of only two female Labour councillors in the borough.\n\nPaul Thomas' daughter\n\nIn 1989, Mrs Thomas was elected to the Labour-run Southwark council, where she served until 1997. She then took up a place on the Conservative-run Newham Council and served until 2005 when she resigned to join the Conservative Party.\n\nMrs Thomas became a member of parliament for North Essex in the 2005 election, after being elected to parliament with Conservative Peter Chote who was also a member of the Conservative Party. In May 2006, she became the second woman to represent the North East in parliament when she won a byelection.\n\nMrs Thomas has been campaigning to get her husband's career back on track.\n\nShe told BBC Newsnight: 'From what I understand about David's working life it's been very difficult. I know about the problems, but I have so much respect for him as a man and as a father.\n\n'So many things have gone on for so many years and David, like so many of the people in his position, is very unhappy because he wants to get back to work. His job has been in the past two years in the health department and then I went to work as a nurse so there was the twofold challenge - he is very committed to work'.\n\nWife of Michael Crick, a former Labour mayor of London, Mrs Thomas is said to enjoy a good relationship with her husband, and he reportedly attends their daughter's school in South London.\n\nMrs Thomas has not commented on allegations made in a Sunday newspaper report this week by former Conservative mayoral candidate Robert Halfon, which alleged that Crick had used his links to prominent politicians to win lucrative government contracts.\n\nShe has also said that she will not make any comment until her son Daniel finishes his course at Oxford University this autumn.\n\nThe Times reports that Crick, who is married, could be suspended from the Conservative Party over the claims made by Halfon. If so, the politician would be required to explain himself and resign from parliament.\n\nMr Halfon, who lost out to Mr Johnson in the 2004 mayoral contest for London, is quoted in the Times saying: 'The problem that has arisen with the Crick family is that their connection to the country has become more than that of a simple local community asset.'\n\nMrs Thomas is reported to have said that people who believe that Crick's behaviour must have been influenced by his family connections are 'wrong' and that 'people with family members in politics have to pay the price for it'.\n\nCrick's ex-wife, who also served on Crick's council, has been living in New York for several years, where she is a professor at Columbia University. Crick was married to his first wife for 18 years, from 1960 to 1991, the paper reports.\n\nHe has three daughters aged between 16 and 33.","token_len":639,"entropy":[10.2805,7.5158,0.7367,8.1787,0.0058,0.0001,1.4624,5.1746,3.8967,2.4452,1.1583,0.8286,3.9261,3.018,2.1585,0.5489,1.1754,6.1786,3.1375,5.9163,4.7774,9.2304,3.6804,6.9437,0.0578,8.6482,0.0576,0.0342,2.5381,1.4077,1.7556,4.2345,8.5002,8.3637,0.7523,0.9114,6.5195,0.0356,0.0005,0.563,5.2256,1.0915,1.64,4.526,0.0057,3.262,0.9886,2.4775,0.7702,0.4805,0.5839,0.6097,1.1848,0.5813,1.0504,0.0062,5.5899,6.0057,5.1237,3.5989,3.626,0.0002,2.3478,4.1813,0.479,3.7478,0.1245,1.4418,1.516,1.545,0.922,2.6613,3.5544,0.4933,4.0546,0.2965,2.2731,1.5447,1.3739,0.0645,1.5914,0.9872,2.5511,0.2721,1.026,3.3993,3.6019,0.6352,0.7612,3.7885,0.3896,0.2673,4.4842,0.646,0.2254,3.4969,0.0725,0.369,2.8565,1.8663,0.6444,2.6364,3.7705,0.066,2.3455,0.8164,2.5415,0.3996,3.0381,0.3417,0.2034,0.4621,0.0002,2.3084,0.0066,3.3547,0.9657,2.2743,0.0071,4.7238,0.5754,5.2904,4.0019,0.5508,3.4414,2.5128,1.5596,1.3595,3.8044,2.4641,0.8372,1.0378,2.6436,4.174,3.1404,4.817,4.238,2.2586,5.3048,1.6322,2.2637,1.1479,1.5915,0.0233,0.2948,2.8965,0.8428,0.5986,3.7256,3.4094,2.5249,0.5573,0.8484,2.018,0.7556,4.2636,1.0555,0.7163,3.2732,1.3223,2.954,0.2754,0.8963,1.3846,1.5163,0.0605,2.1654,1.1447,1.2818,2.7741,2.7006,0.3222,0.0002,1.728,0.0098,2.7302,1.6985,6.3249,2.5626,2.8456,3.1896,2.3011,0.9405,5.8289,0.1262,0.0202,0.0299,1.322,1.7091,0.0002,1.3128,1.7311,1.9756,1.2316,2.4447,0.5743,3.1044,6.7124,1.9788,0.3315,1.6374,3.2439,4.8678,1.3316,5.6676,0.3586,3.3354,1.3006,1.7832,1.8183,1.3201,0.9842,2.0017,2.8073,4.4875,1.185,3.9207,4.0638,1.6755,0.6759,3.0533,6.2755,0.7999,1.0326,0.0452,0.5527,2.3334,0.1166,1.2729,0.8162,1.2083,0.0802,1.4957,0.7444,0.7129,0.0002,0.0593,4.2736,2.4947,3.1182,1.3248,1.8684,2.0282,3.2843,2.1498,1.2526,0.0363,1.5577,4.0412,4.1538,3.5936,2.1101,0.0035,3.0192,2.364,1.3113,2.1995,0.8851,1.6506,0.1541,2.7494,3.2665,4.9798,3.7934,0.8593,2.9424,0.2981,1.8153,0.7188,0.4017,0.6718,1.0635,5.3409,4.4553,2.1972,0.4418,2.4339,2.22,3.9817,3.786,0.7393,2.1048,1.8933,5.82,2.9519,1.749,4.3934,4.0403,6.9186,1.0207,1.7929,2.8472,0.3771,2.1822,3.627,3.0306,1.5997,4.1367,4.6179,5.6789,3.2773,3.4393,3.5686,3.9519,2.6096,6.0117,0.2414,3.8667,7.2723,0.1199,0.0002,6.2383,1.0357,2.1749,4.7152,5.1982,0.0794,1.1239,3.465,1.2379,2.329,5.4419,0.214,0.4829,0.8219,3.4869,0.1287,2.255,3.0832,0.0263,6.059,1.2761,2.2824,0.2302,0.0088,0.8691,0.5301,1.4919,3.3872,3.3484,4.9738,5.0714,2.0967,2.3917,0.2841,1.8573,2.4617,3.5731,1.5762,0.2805,0.2572,0.0002,2.2303,0.1322,2.1826,3.0705,1.2297,0.1812,4.828,1.6808,1.7926,2.1016,2.3768,1.019,2.7818,4.8478,0.3873,2.7271,2.4691,3.2335,5.0008,0.0904,4.7057,3.0994,0.0009,1.1566,2.0734,2.2894,0.5406,2.7382,0.0002,1.091,3.9093,0.7968,4.5789,0.983,6.1591,2.4005,0.5082,3.272,2.0033,2.4968,0.0281,0.4638,0.2934,0.0002,3.8057,1.7101,2.4129,3.9584,1.1574,0.6674,2.5031,0.6526,3.1707,0.6663,0.8275,1.1593,2.26,3.9366,5.9953,3.1896,0.4472,4.4218,0.8232,1.8889,0.5632,3.0311,1.1661,0.1057,0.5716,0.0002,2.6096,4.9917,2.8217,0.1394,1.5649,0.0003,2.1121,0.5694,1.737,2.2282,2.1603,5.2945,1.5715,4.6361,0.452,0.7738,2.3316,0.1164,2.0072,0.4068,1.6274,3.8318,0.7993,0.8279,0.0005,0.4594,5.8984,1.8337,0.146,2.3917,4.708,1.281,0.9336,4.2798,0.0307,4.0396,1.6064,2.55,3.6881,1.2466,2.3302,0.2964,0.4925,0.0002,3.4012,1.6371,0.0003,1.6165,0.5231,3.0927,1.9786,0.2929,1.7154,2.4236,0.4112,0.2406,3.7563,1.049,2.5969,2.8861,1.0772,0.1161,2.326,4.7177,1.368,0.1098,1.7493,2.0065,0.6466,0.023,2.5791,4.1011,4.3077,3.4895,0.8563,2.2954,2.3163,1.285,0.0052,1.0088,0.3119,0.53,3.7301,4.1329,0.7199,1.0946,6.1185,2.0659,2.8268,3.3216,2.5287,2.2211,0.1337,0.5192,4.5502,3.9493,5.4012,3.4458,1.5875,0.3236,0.0002,3.4894,0.6549,2.5329,2.8167,0.2014,0.5681,1.7118,1.4148,6.8941,2.1431,4.2279,1.8269,1.1403,0.0002,2.3818,3.3498,6.4702,1.2084,0.2631,2.8198,0.0971,0.9994,4.0227,1.6744,1.2697,0.4345,3.9592,2.1631,0.2661,1.0871,2.2266,2.7358,3.2257,3.1096,4.3781,0.3899,1.4059,2.2861,1.4281,5.7389,0.8744,0.1388,1.5062,1.542,0.247,0.4303,0.0002,3.6505,0.0348,2.1631,4.4932,0.0339,0.1598,2.0346,3.2371,3.7167,3.4596,1.6693,6.4883,0.0001,0.005,0.7928,0.4098,1.4928,3.085,5.0131,0.4061,3.6337,1.0921,1.595,1.9468,0.1132,2.0518,1.6697,0.0882,1.3831,1.9113,3.1946,0.9398,0.7352,0.078,0.3376,4.1133,0.0002,3.1157,3.0576,0.2855,1.2108,0.9806,0.0065,2.2587,3.3984,0.0527,2.0772,1.8369,4.2096,0.5822,3.637,0.9074,5.7346,3.1145,0.6059,0.076,0.5446,0.0002,2.5455,1.6762,2.5866,2.9336,5.728,1.4392,2.9794,0.0209,5.1977,1.3907]}
{"id":3411,"ended":false,"length":570,"gen_text":"\u00c2s\u00e2r @ - @ \u0131 Tevfik was 83 @. @ 01 meters ( 272 @. @ 3 ft ) long between perpendiculars and she had a beam of 16 m ( 52 ft ) @. @ 12 meters ( 46 @. @ 3 ft ) wide\n\nThe fact is that with all the things I have written above, the answer actually depends a lot on what you mean by beam and parallel. In order to understand the original question we need to understand the term beam and parallel.\n\nI am no physicist so I will not try to explain exactly what makes a beam or what is the difference between perpendicular and parallel. The problem is that the definition of these terms can be a bit ambiguous; one would need to research it more to understand the answer with certainty. A few things:\n\nIt is not unusual for a long object to have a fairly small radius. For example, the Earth has a radius of about 4,749,600 km or 3,721,400 miles. As far as I can find however, the diameter of a single beam of a telescope of the size found on a telescope is given as 24.5 cm \/ 2 ft. A telescope with a length of 20.5 m (66.2 @ 2 ft) (a very wide telescope!) could probably produce a beam of about 1 m ( 3.3 ft) long @. @ 28 cm ( 12.9 \/ 8. 9Inch). If we assume that each of these beams is parallel to the telescope axis at 30 cm (1.57 inches) then as far as I know the actual distance traveled between each beams of a telescope can be about 0.04 seconds. If we assume that each beam has a relatively smaller diameter (e.g. only a few centimeters in diameter I should say; at my location a telescope with a beam of 12.5 m (46.4 @ 3 = 52 @ 5 feet) would be very different!) then the actual distance traveled could be about 0.03 seconds @. @ 15 cm (5 inches). If the dimensions of the beams are larger then you have a problem. For example, a 20 m (66.2 @ 5 feet) telescope has a beam length of 30 m @ 1 ft @ 2.25 m (6 feet) as you can see on the page at: http:\/\/www.spaceweather.com\/facts\/beam_length.shtml\n\nThe problem is that if we think about a telescope using the first definition of beam, we are going to think, that the \"beam\" of a high power telescope are the parallel beams of the telescope. What does science say? The answer is \"It depends.\" How can we understand without knowing something about theoretical physics? It really depends a lot on all of these things that I wrote above.\n\nNow that we know the answer of what beam length a telescope produces we can use this information to figure out how to take a picture with a telescope!\n\nIf you are interested in more information about the physics of the Earth, I would recommend to look at the following two links:","token_len":641,"entropy":[5.4994,10.0909,3.7323,10.0062,7.8226,5.3693,5.3513,4.8329,11.7567,2.7931,1.5136,1.44,8.1425,12.6337,4.8363,5.784,2.6783,9.9081,12.5576,3.7963,12.4638,7.4304,1.1838,0.7557,4.5589,4.9658,2.2746,4.4957,8.1265,9.7773,1.6089,3.8775,7.4357,2.737,1.3714,5.5701,1.5004,5.1782,3.2922,1.1524,3.0169,1.2679,0.4896,1.5747,1.0135,0.3294,3.9931,2.0162,0.245,2.9725,2.4095,0.1065,0.0708,2.0584,0.1018,0.1335,2.6845,4.1332,0.2234,3.1803,6.4038,2.5291,0.4238,5.8901,3.5993,1.0291,5.8085,2.4149,1.6087,2.522,2.0319,0.7859,2.0295,4.8907,6.8639,2.4056,3.0192,0.3122,0.0763,1.8071,0.9988,1.0748,0.3244,3.2991,1.553,3.9879,0.3744,2.7234,3.6515,0.1347,2.7576,1.17,5.3647,1.0991,4.4157,0.8863,0.1218,1.9622,1.4717,4.3001,2.7032,2.0521,0.6388,0.4335,0.7222,0.0002,4.1326,2.5916,5.311,2.5616,2.1409,0.5443,1.6097,1.1401,1.1864,0.0678,0.8653,3.4496,0.6375,5.0986,0.5391,0.1811,2.4435,2.4238,2.3152,1.4153,1.9685,0.0414,2.9443,0.1914,0.1857,0.3849,2.8218,4.5059,0.6323,0.3712,2.2515,3.8224,0.2959,2.8706,0.3951,3.2998,0.8167,2.7557,0.4255,2.8857,5.861,4.6564,4.2628,2.4602,0.4106,5.8655,3.1649,2.6,1.646,1.6639,1.5479,3.0049,6.5449,2.7559,0.0663,5.0934,3.3152,2.6297,5.5725,0.1178,0.0002,4.1651,0.4621,2.2289,4.9407,0.9877,1.5979,6.0815,3.4966,0.2752,0.6362,0.5566,5.5239,4.1409,4.0172,1.1382,2.1492,0.2929,0.5269,1.4198,3.676,1.6496,0.1459,0.1531,0.0672,1.5305,1.9052,1.153,2.8368,3.2004,1.7528,3.7522,0.3166,3.2837,0.7894,0.1736,2.5476,3.2176,0.0233,3.1878,1.0656,0.6584,4.7945,3.5023,0.0116,0.4309,1.8397,4.161,6.9291,0.195,1.2187,2.8567,0.1046,0.8728,3.7918,1.578,1.3681,1.3297,3.1938,3.5012,2.1115,1.9451,4.9985,1.7134,2.6905,1.2429,1.5367,5.6841,0.3399,5.4566,1.397,1.9107,1.7378,5.0621,4.3056,1.408,1.3969,3.574,3.4284,1.6934,0.4131,4.5553,0.1255,3.5747,2.1756,1.0982,0.6467,0.6993,1.8101,1.4712,3.1412,4.3237,3.6506,0.1413,0.5536,5.421,3.9748,3.8035,3.8518,0.7153,4.0232,4.6655,4.5718,3.5691,0.3345,0.1784,0.5744,1.524,2.6825,1.2596,0.4094,0.8863,0.2374,0.4302,0.7957,0.7598,2.77,6.1337,1.0012,0.0887,5.6466,1.4079,0.5101,2.8,0.4512,3.3408,4.1701,3.5154,0.9868,9.1743,7.651,1.4304,1.6808,3.1281,1.5388,1.4805,0.5344,4.8217,2.1725,1.1121,0.8161,1.3465,1.6587,0.6492,0.5863,3.1618,2.7418,4.0713,4.7919,2.0048,0.3796,1.0424,0.5407,3.6439,2.7875,0.1522,1.917,6.5715,0.9839,0.0104,0.2334,1.3197,1.7758,3.657,3.5015,5.3704,2.5788,3.1195,4.5193,3.1824,0.8428,0.2924,3.9343,0.5027,2.7823,2.6558,0.0337,4.3869,4.6886,0.7934,2.8425,0.8561,1.0741,0.3644,1.702,0.391,2.2617,0.4207,5.8701,5.4452,1.8715,2.1116,3.3525,0.0018,0.0084,0.139,4.8004,3.1315,0.6938,1.9168,3.4915,0.1269,7.5517,5.0284,0.7138,4.9829,5.5872,5.5893,5.3635,2.798,1.3885,1.0437,0.2617,1.7808,0.8734,3.3306,1.0195,0.7638,0.4278,0.1512,1.451,1.0243,2.35,0.212,1.2241,8.7802,4.5466,1.8172,3.768,2.864,0.9022,1.3215,1.8853,3.2936,5.8578,4.687,0.6123,0.6325,0.9097,0.4001,0.2892,2.5579,0.1503,1.2468,0.2535,0.0024,3.2473,0.1236,3.4449,0.1794,0.0495,4.0926,0.2696,0.1633,2.6257,2.656,0.4503,2.4368,2.1366,5.6066,0.3408,0.484,2.1323,0.6267,4.0616,1.5757,4.453,2.7999,1.8466,1.74,1.1141,2.2678,0.1672,0.4223,1.2623,3.6007,0.9057,0.2443,0.0633,0.1513,0.0692,0.1393,1.2811,0.8467,0.1059,0.3316,3.736,0.138,0.2663,3.914,0.0558,3.4789,0.6131,4.8812,4.0926,2.0229,2.9645,3.4832,1.0086,3.3768,1.2859,0.3178,2.7045,3.3402,0.9917,5.6292,3.4082,0.1189,0.0459,2.2795,0.3564,6.1239,3.3238,3.3956,0.4055,0.0021,0.3523,0.0118,4.6726,0.937,0.258,0.2025,0.0033,0.1299,0.1614,0.0698,4.9569,0.7199,2.6775,1.0706,0.5325,0.3566,3.0223,0.0041,1.9786,0.0002,2.0624,2.3331,0.8032,0.2458,2.8066,1.9141,4.2197,1.4374,1.6141,1.5489,4.6125,1.9849,5.6562,1.2947,1.0422,0.892,1.872,1.7454,2.9481,2.74,0.042,3.045,6.3421,1.738,1.4491,4.8925,0.4841,0.0967,1.6838,0.9956,7.5613,2.3321,0.1387,5.9747,0.9691,1.7954,1.0111,1.3511,0.5006,0.875,0.5482,4.7578,2.8714,8.5675,1.0941,1.2025,2.9734,1.1189,0.3879,3.8939,2.9884,0.4953,1.9724,6.1515,2.2644,0.7402,4.7099,6.9115,2.0978,5.0877,0.3195,7.0508,0.1575,0.2384,3.7454,4.9753,0.3837,2.4704,0.0276,0.3507,7.2958,2.288,2.4077,1.2077,3.0803,0.7191,3.8707,0.2808,0.5081,1.0965,0.0002,3.7384,2.6687,0.448,1.2032,1.6126,1.284,3.4222,2.3005,3.3511,2.0314,1.5595,0.1846,3.6569,2.0316,0.5074,3.9001,1.2727,0.9846,0.1431,3.1062,0.0557,1.4715,2.7919,6.2761,1.0001,1.2076,2.0723,0.399,0.2581,3.9109,0.8857,0.0002,3.5771,0.9507,1.7113,1.5252,0.1656,2.839,0.9799,0.7208,1.459,2.0134,0.3451,2.3276,3.2584,1.2836,2.5582,1.994,0.7713,2.5361,2.9655,0.3067,0.9007,0.8327,4.1785,1.9693,0.2998]}
{"id":3580,"ended":false,"length":567,"gen_text":"According to National Geographic's report, the story of `` Archaeoraptor `` begins in July 1997 in < unk >, China, where farmers routinely dug in the shale pits with picks and shovels to reach the coal-rich shale below. But these days, the technology for drilling in shale has improved considerably, and the fossilized rock has provided new clues to how dinosaurs lived.\n\nThis latest research is significant because it shows that Archaeoraptor had feathers before it roamed the Earth during the early Cretaceous. Its feathers might have helped it glide at low speeds, allowing it to reach the upper strata that contain the rich fossil fuels from which it was adapted.\n\nA featherless dinosaur would have made for an unusual flyer, but it would be one the dinosaur's closest living relative: Triceratops. As a large carnivore with distinctive big horns, Triceratops is often viewed as an elegant, graceful member of its category. But it and the other dinosaurs often faced challenges, and there are hints of those in the fossilized remains of Archeoraptor.\n\nAs reported in Nature magazine, the bone in this newly discovered specimen of Archaeoraptor showed some evidence of having been cut and broken, perhaps in a fight with another dinosaur. Fossils of other dinosaurs are often riddled with such evidence, says Paleontologist Greg Erickson, the lead author on the report < unk >.\n\n\"Paleontologists are used to seeing things like this where the bone is broken and fractured,\" Erickson says. \"In this instance, we don't know where it was broken and we can only speculate about it because of the shape.\"\n\nBut the shape, and the bone structure, is remarkably unique for a dinosaur, says paleontologist Ian Malcolm of the U.K.'s University of Cambridge, who was not involved with the study. \"It's extremely unique,\" he says. At first glance, Malcolm says, this new specimen might not seem interesting. But after comparing it with other specimens, he says, it \"seems to be an extremely unusual dinosaur that makes an excellent candidate for reconstructing, through DNA analysis, the physiology and behavior of Archaeoraptor.\"\n\nThe new dinosaur will be formally named by its discoverers in a ceremony on January 16 in Beijing. The naming ceremony is scheduled only several weeks before the skeleton's bones are moved to China, where the bones will undergo a period of further study. The bones -- described in a paper < unk > published in Science, and slated to be published in a second paper this month in Proceedings of the Royal Society B -- will remain in China for several weeks after that and be eventually returned to the United States for preparation of the museum show.\n\n\"It all seems to be coming together very well,\" Malcolm says. \"This is just another outstanding

{"id":3143,"ended":true,"length":554,"gen_text":"Locusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short @ - @ horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. It has been shown that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile sensitivity and sensitivity to sound are found in bees that are swarmed. Bees that are swarmed fly in pairs, flying from hive top to underside. Bees that are swarmed are active at dawn and dusk, and are highly vigilant with respect to food sources. Bees that swarm are very efficient at dispersing the pollen load. Swarming is a very high-risk behaviour, so individuals that swarm need to be taken very seriously. In some species swarming can be considered as a reproductive strategy, but most of the time it is simply an aggressive response to overcrowding.\n\nCrocodile hornet:\n\nIt is now known that hornets use their front legs to scrape a narrow groove in the bark of large tree species, thereby creating a pathway into the bark cell from which they emerge. The groove will be left dry, and there will be no way for the insects to emerge from it.\n\nHornet larvae: This larvae uses the silk in the host tree to build a tunnel for its pupation.\n\nHornets are solitary animals and eat only flowers. They gather at night where they sleep, leaving one side of the pupa exposed which will then enter into the crevice of the bark.\n\nAfter approximately four days, the pupa will enter into the crevice of the bark where the sun is strongest and where it is warm. The pupa will also be near the ground and will emerge into the same cell it entered into, providing food for the adult hornet that will emerge in just 15-20 days.\n\nThe pupae will emerge completely covered with a cocoon of silk. One egg weighs up to 300 g and contains between 1.2 and 1.9 million silk-spinners. The young will emerge from the cocoon ready to reproduce by the first week of February during which time they will nurse for three or four short weeks, depending on the species.\n\nWhen the newly-emerged adult hornet, which is about the size of a small bat, locates its meal, it will attack by piercing with its venomous mandibles and tearing apart the victim's skin. The entire attack lasts just a few seconds though, and the hornet quickly retreats into the bark, where the venom is absorbed and the victim dies.\n\nIn some species, young hornets will attack other insects with their mandibles as well, notably ants and bees.\n\nWhen a hornet's prey dies, the adult will sting the corpse with its deadly injector of venom, which causes the victim to experience excruciating pain. The venom attacks the nervous system of the victim, causing an overdose of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine and making the victim convulsive.\n\nAfter a period of convulsing, the victim will collapse on the ground and die and the hornet will quickly finish off the rest of the body by piercing the prey with its mandibles, killing it completely.","token_len":643,"entropy":[5.2317,1.746,2.8043,2.9456,8.1326,1.1491,9.0857,0.1916,7.6409,2.5003,0.3697,9.3071,15.8391,6.7538,11.2341,9.3355,0.5194,5.042,0.0608,0.2314,4.1443,0.8757,2.2338,4.5657,0.0191,0.055,0.4784,4.4669,2.973,0.8152,2.7786,0.1705,4.7267,0.5519,4.1379,1.0289,2.2429,3.4171,0.1073,7.6167,0.0174,1.6784,8.9518,8.7185,1.6646,1.8547,4.5017,0.0385,3.5948,1.534,4.7218,0.2587,6.3479,1.9966,1.1463,1.6198,0.8714,0.5907,3.6412,1.1026,0.4101,0.4612,0.0717,5.4337,1.9646,4.2823,1.3201,5.6091,3.1486,2.3904,8.2925,0.0773,7.685,1.5283,3.4164,0.5376,0.1691,0.5166,0.026,1.7205,5.179,1.6823,3.2512,0.2333,0.104,1.092,1.2594,1.668,5.0649,4.4532,5.2199,1.0157,0.0033,5.3613,1.1111,0.5885,2.7568,0.2216,4.293,1.0172,3.8539,4.3593,1.0736,4.0842,0.1934,3.5243,2.6268,2.3131,1.657,2.4252,0.1749,1.5625,1.5135,3.6571,5.9026,1.4042,0.8063,0.5801,1.4723,3.2493,5.3205,1.134,1.2585,3.8624,0.2464,0.1266,5.2654,1.5777,0.1125,0.5139,3.8171,2.7801,1.8266,3.1122,0.4543,2.1559,0.9443,4.9994,2.6481,0.4595,3.5019,0.4049,1.508,2.5389,3.8761,2.8204,0.3478,0.9039,0.8252,0.225,2.5328,1.9159,3.0829,1.8428,0.2319,2.0485,0.0186,0.2173,1.6292,0.0609,4.5699,4.6595,0.13,1.1397,3.2339,1.05,3.2764,1.3374,0.0002,5.0473,0.4884,5.6438,1.4147,0.0399,2.6433,0.438,2.7783,2.0092,4.5953,0.4809,0.6391,4.9196,3.9709,5.3552,2.2156,1.3,0.5839,1.2857,0.377,5.4153,2.9467,3.8298,1.5149,3.8104,1.8405,0.7793,3.1145,3.6943,0.2149,3.4667,6.6848,4.2099,0.4239,0.858,1.897,0.7609,1.7183,1.5176,5.4508,1.614,5.4479,5.3176,1.7901,1.5457,4.9693,0.6898,0.1067,2.0503,3.4475,0.5648,0.5524,3.4307,0.0995,4.0947,1.6165,1.8716,0.613,2.6455,0.0002,2.6802,1.1139,1.1906,3.1335,1.5851,6.2941,4.6409,4.6621,1.853,5.877,3.7754,1.4122,4.879,1.1733,1.4451,2.1604,0.6337,3.6273,3.8255,1.6957,2.1014,2.3142,0.61,1.7552,0.0002,1.7232,0.2652,0.8794,1.6572,4.3484,3.3509,1.7379,5.6163,1.4649,2.9579,0.9723,1.1149,6.1577,3.4146,1.5042,5.6608,0.6051,3.2773,1.8571,5.7047,6.5303,3.9722,0.1407,0.5155,5.9912,1.9347,2.1196,5.8939,3.2677,3.534,5.9832,2.8335,0.2311,6.1812,0.7031,1.7386,0.1456,1.8489,1.2111,1.701,0.0002,5.5553,5.0492,3.7355,0.9547,0.9531,0.1555,0.9006,0.1721,0.6804,4.2078,0.8468,0.204,2.5433,0.0045,0.8875,0.0483,0.07,2.8544,2.2484,5.264,1.4724,3.191,1.7412,2.8987,1.6291,2.124,1.7818,2.8816,1.3245,0.753,0.0974,0.6015,5.7164,1.9676,5.2466,1.2393,3.9681,2.186,1.647,3.6987,2.618,0.2944,6.3278,5.1694,2.9455,1.3764,1.1578,2.8317,5.3285,3.4845,0.8312,0.6196,1.9554,1.0864,0.3928,3.3581,1.1244,0.5023,2.5574,4.8726,6.4493,1.6835,0.8094,0.1612,0.1799,0.5652,0.0002,1.9875,2.5444,2.6072,0.9743,3.3338,5.7567,1.4357,1.3322,1.9907,4.484,0.0018,0.9725,0.6845,1.1664,6.5827,5.1142,6.593,3.5624,0.0059,4.281,2.5275,1.1406,3.5244,2.3276,2.9466,1.5249,2.0868,0.5317,1.2675,0.005,3.3512,1.0218,4.819,2.8617,4.706,0.0618,0.2788,1.2982,4.5943,2.2606,2.4731,1.3664,0.176,0.3868,0.0172,5.916,0.2558,5.0444,4.5987,1.3742,2.7744,3.4344,0.2225,3.034,6.4457,1.1459,0.508,0.4502,0.4414,5.6811,1.1959,3.2171,2.1893,0.1029,9.0622,0.7521,2.7128,3.0755,0.0832,0.4758,0.241,0.2403,0.7221,0.0002,4.1624,0.637,5.9121,1.5923,1.0139,0.0574,1.1239,0.6916,0.1916,5.2999,1.4146,1.1111,1.9352,2.6906,0.0511,0.0177,0.1264,2.1864,4.8611,0.0951,5.6841,0.0001,1.7172,4.839,0.7213,0.2115,0.7088,2.9014,3.6087,1.8033,4.9139,0.1879,4.2418,0.0937,1.6756,0.0032,1.502,4.1711,1.7621,0.2151,2.6186,0.7331,3.0679,0.704,1.1511,5.7188,3.0386,1.8688,2.9049,1.034,0.2199,0.1945,7.9749,0.9648,0.8428,0.8396,1.0513,0.043,3.3261,1.8193,0.0025,2.1915,0.431,2.8253,2.7247,2.0377,2.7357,4.2966,1.3621,1.9095,1.9881,1.027,1.0123,1.0126,0.5496,0.5421,0.0002,3.7044,2.2505,0.2654,0.7978,5.0047,0.5092,0.1064,1.2006,3.5244,2.7452,1.5738,4.0719,0.812,1.0242,0.0056,3.6247,0.5507,1.5542,5.9675,2.3544,1.0599,1.8201,0.2582,0.962,0.0002,4.3152,1.9588,0.8172,0.0042,2.7624,2.7345,2.9211,0.2388,0.6581,3.3057,1.1095,5.5591,0.8252,1.3843,2.6134,0.2797,4.7097,6.5012,0.2925,5.0561,0.6966,1.455,1.8113,1.5639,1.9834,0.4015,0.4774,4.5129,1.5122,0.0854,1.0605,1.6263,1.8607,5.7645,0.4985,0.6575,0.0407,2.0799,0.1416,0.3925,0.8783,0.7497,4.2641,4.7168,0.135,2.2044,0.5906,0.1468,3.9779,0.1746,0.0074,0.0016,2.316,5.4006,0.5165,0.2049,3.773,2.9685,0.781,1.4249,0.0002,3.1071,1.8691,2.9323,0.028,0.5802,0.4134,2.3074,0.4398,0.1938,0.3252,0.8947,3.1607,3.4333,0.1455,0.1495,0.9628,1.0446,5.6874,0.984,0.4569,0.0404,0.1532,4.0865,4.6326,0.9184,0.5092,1.5414,0.0287,0.8016,3.1579,2.2308,2.4281,1.0213,5.0724,0.6043,0.1045,0.2766,0.0152,2.3419,3.0026,0.6177,4.631,0.1309]}
{"id":2534,"ended":true,"length":610,"gen_text":"Viral diseases carried by wolves include rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, < unk >, and canine coronavirus. Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, where over one hundred people die each year due to infection. The disease can be transmitted from person to person via bite or scratched wounds. In 2001 the Russian government banned the importation of domestic dogs from states where rabies is endemic, primarily Ukraine and Belarus. This ban was not extended to other countries of the former USSR. The disease is most infectious in November where ticks are active and then it is transmitted to humans in April-May. As a result of the ban, many people who were exposed to dogs and wolf infected with rabies had to be kept out of work with strict hygiene standards.\n\nIn China, wolves are hunted nearly to extinction. The population has shrunk to a few dozen in China, from nearly twenty thousand in the 1950's. There are also concerns that wolves will become extinct in the Tibetan Plateau, where there are believed to be about three hundred wolves. Chinese regulations prohibit hunters during the breeding season of wolves in southern Tibet, the northernmost portion of the plateau. In 1998, four wolves were found to have rabies and shot. Several more animals showed signs of infection after killing. On August 8, 1999 one wolf became infected with rabies which was transmitted from another wolf. The disease then moved into the heart of the infected animal's skull, causing brain swelling and seizures. On January 6, 2000 the same wolf was killed in a local town. The incident caused great public outcry. On February 20, 2000, the local government announced a three-year ban on hunting the wild dogs in China. The ban went into effect the following winter.\n\nThe decline in wolves in the US is due to several factors: predation by feral hogs; loss of habitat due to livestock grazing; habitat loss, fragmentation, and fragmentation of buffer areas; and killing of wolves for economic purposes (hunting, control of deer populations, and trophy hunting). In many towns and cities, the wolf population is considered \"problematic\". Hunters, farmers, and others want their own wolves. Some towns and townships have passed legislation that would limit hunting of wolves and any form of control. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which regulates management of federal lands, recently prohibited any wolf hunt except in the most remote regions for special reasons such as protection of human life.\n\nHunting of wolves is a traditional tradition in parts of China. In Tibet, hunters kill packs who attack livestock and people, the dogs are then killed and the bones are used as soup and used as ammunition. In China, wolves that kill livestock and people are considered a bad omen for the harvest and may be shot. Other forms of hunting of wolves require special permits (mainly to the forestry department) and hunters pay a fee for the permission (mainly for use of the land). The permit requires the permission of the area's local government and requires regular patrols of the area to kill the wolves. This is one possible reason for the high number of wolves in China.","token_len":644,"entropy":[7.3339,5.4479,7.0563,0.1916,7.3365,4.0953,1.2562,0.0,0.4168,2.0968,0.0304,0.0,0.0003,0.2606,2.9934,0.4318,0.1363,0.0001,0.0023,0.2485,6.2761,4.4035,4.6787,0.3088,13.4162,10.2432,3.0712,2.3632,3.0845,1.2259,2.6565,5.3969,0.0027,0.0115,0.3185,4.817,1.5735,4.0221,1.5569,2.9917,0.7361,2.1473,0.0001,1.5823,7.1063,1.1578,2.722,4.069,4.0548,1.2676,3.1439,1.2927,1.4165,0.0033,3.5947,0.0042,3.5098,0.8416,2.3056,2.504,2.541,0.4603,1.1055,1.6642,3.4457,0.1094,0.0196,2.7031,2.6877,0.9376,3.0997,3.0051,0.7441,2.4584,5.463,3.4306,2.5674,1.5862,2.2633,0.5011,1.3584,0.5903,0.2167,3.3774,0.6404,1.0067,5.1529,1.0513,0.196,0.0,0.2313,0.6172,1.6093,4.5696,3.9937,0.8212,0.7177,0.4377,3.7377,0.9346,1.1492,3.7876,2.2104,0.0541,1.4281,0.681,4.1938,0.2675,0.1638,1.6585,0.6893,2.3274,3.2586,0.9152,3.6727,5.4513,0.7516,6.3139,7.9959,5.7953,0.5534,1.1412,1.5714,4.2127,2.9063,1.6451,2.3373,0.7832,0.7694,2.5293,2.8671,2.9011,0.3906,0.7574,5.2665,1.6687,0.2955,0.728,0.7366,0.4935,0.4082,2.9594,2.6316,2.3045,2.4247,2.8817,0.1776,2.5617,3.8924,4.3116,4.2743,0.8947,0.3228,0.0002,4.001,0.6437,0.6357,4.8901,4.0817,0.0108,4.5394,6.3559,4.403,4.3693,4.1979,0.5413,1.9147,0.0017,1.8975,5.725,0.3739,2.9933,0.8332,3.4574,5.7687,0.8627,0.0306,1.0529,1.9695,3.0064,2.0148,4.5454,0.7535,2.4498,0.7332,2.5145,2.6576,3.2834,1.514,4.1211,4.2245,4.3429,0.3454,0.3956,0.4983,1.8284,2.1377,0.2024,3.4651,0.4912,2.8453,4.2572,0.6167,1.5219,2.3861,2.2644,0.5811,0.2371,1.1096,5.3737,0.264,0.0018,1.8419,1.5302,2.2322,0.3232,4.6332,0.0083,0.0271,3.7233,3.2589,0.4604,1.0846,0.4732,5.4128,4.0388,1.6114,4.3502,9.0531,0.5952,1.1423,0.0528,2.4825,1.2107,3.0225,5.9603,2.8965,1.4367,3.9008,4.0567,2.5242,2.691,0.0074,0.3503,2.0036,0.4699,2.4644,4.3333,0.7464,5.3117,0.7386,0.1927,3.5858,2.4673,0.4153,1.3254,0.0,1.8736,5.0298,1.1783,5.8989,2.1243,3.2475,6.4887,0.7308,0.0124,2.3364,2.9558,5.2272,1.8746,5.1552,2.8183,3.451,0.1331,1.3851,6.035,0.3985,5.4605,0.7965,0.8858,0.6978,0.0001,6.2486,1.1789,2.5798,2.6765,2.2028,0.5145,1.3205,1.2679,3.1723,3.7879,4.7717,2.1675,0.9891,4.3679,0.4198,0.2464,4.2315,1.145,2.5667,3.5677,1.4491,1.3614,3.2734,0.8918,0.7398,5.014,0.1745,3.7344,5.327,3.5018,0.0416,0.1361,2.1021,3.5849,0.3657,0.7907,2.0979,3.1577,1.6307,5.5506,5.1387,1.0851,1.5979,4.9586,2.1556,3.34,1.5129,1.2883,1.779,2.6226,1.4286,3.3863,0.1472,0.3153,1.1014,1.1242,3.4481,0.3969,1.3524,1.3719,3.6042,0.882,0.4384,1.1374,0.0492,1.0332,3.6949,4.0079,2.5395,1.3671,3.0988,0.4049,1.989,1.4281,4.5312,0.031,0.0479,4.0966,0.3016,5.8943,0.289,0.8689,0.0002,2.4089,5.5527,1.2961,2.6313,0.9705,1.8344,3.4798,1.0481,1.7276,0.5163,3.3329,0.183,1.9543,4.5587,0.0036,0.7265,5.2304,2.186,0.006,2.4794,1.5629,0.0296,0.5613,0.8292,0.0051,3.924,0.7586,0.6874,3.9888,1.2138,4.0426,1.8083,0.2409,0.2341,0.8764,0.5658,5.9462,2.7573,0.7144,0.9606,5.1748,0.9261,0.3436,2.4046,5.5838,1.2639,2.5532,2.5781,0.0371,0.9186,4.5715,0.5011,4.9872,0.9579,0.3104,1.1326,3.6629,0.0956,0.2355,1.965,4.2847,6.7032,0.9549,0.4995,0.944,2.3229,2.6533,0.4813,1.1653,3.4776,3.1914,3.3,0.7672,2.5676,3.8146,2.6353,3.3243,0.0778,0.4884,2.6433,4.1799,4.9229,2.7455,1.1534,1.2749,3.5032,2.5521,0.8566,5.0714,0.8699,1.0965,3.2083,4.3797,1.8064,3.621,3.5115,2.1115,1.2412,0.2965,2.3009,5.1555,5.2598,0.0072,1.8601,1.6273,2.5048,2.4374,0.5395,0.0791,0.0046,0.0318,3.3877,2.0186,2.0693,6.4449,0.1512,4.0812,1.3188,0.3541,4.2352,5.0261,3.908,2.6381,3.664,4.7222,1.4165,2.4191,2.8146,1.9712,3.6874,5.5093,4.8339,1.366,3.3831,0.0024,3.7894,0.0707,2.904,2.548,1.4312,1.336,0.0002,3.5677,0.1597,1.3828,0.4256,1.1671,2.7768,4.5422,3.4333,0.3223,3.106,0.0021,3.4415,1.3346,1.5236,4.5216,0.459,3.6794,2.0811,4.4919,7.4705,3.5995,0.7038,1.5375,3.0084,1.7986,5.4118,4.8179,1.2601,1.4693,1.9553,1.1722,0.9092,4.0137,0.5686,1.4585,1.4605,3.0151,2.8784,2.8955,1.1498,5.9505,0.672,1.2544,1.9919,0.3555,1.689,4.3258,3.5931,0.4946,2.0649,0.6436,0.2999,1.8597,1.9616,3.2981,0.0102,0.0,2.7749,0.3023,4.1621,1.935,4.4251,0.7076,3.3258,0.8266,4.7772,3.8079,0.003,1.645,2.1824,0.1545,5.9497,1.5501,0.3032,4.7148,4.8407,0.059,2.4356,3.4716,4.9243,1.289,0.8159,0.5518,5.0422,2.701,0.5642,0.4413,2.1384,0.8736,4.2572,4.3139,5.3559,0.0007,1.565,6.2905,0.09,1.2284,1.796,0.8458,2.5083,3.0172,3.4509,1.5779,2.9637,0.066,0.4525,5.1887,0.454,1.7275,0.797,1.4236,3.3714,5.9108,5.7528,1.2972,0.135,0.7703,1.3289,4.8701,2.2475,0.2738,0.4923,4.0586,1.5111,4.09,6.0102,0.5962,1.1624,0.2165,3.3601,1.3126,0.005,1.2822,1.4074,1.0566,0.8124]}
{"id":4974,"ended":true,"length":542,"gen_text":"A tropical depression formed June 26 from a westward @ - @ moving area of disturbed weather. The next day, it developed gale @ - @ force winds and was named Claudia.\n\nA Tropical Storm in the Atlantic\n\nOn June 29, the front tracked south-southwest and then south-southeasterly to the south-central Bahamas. The storm center made landfall on July 7 near St. Maarten as a tropical storm \u2014 its first time near that island.\n\nThe storm rapidly intensified and became a Category 3 hurricane on July 1. Within hours, it produced significant winds of 115-120 mph \u2014 more than 15 mph faster than average \u2014 and torrential rain. While the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression over the next few days, it continued to produce heavy rains and high surf.\n\nClaudia strengthened into a hurricane the next day, July 8, with peak winds reaching 115 mph. The hurricane intensified even more, increasing the weight of the low pressure system, and it became a full-blown Category 4 storm on July 10.\n\nOn July 14, Claudia's storm surge caused flooding in northern Florida, as well as in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. The storm produced two large impacts in Georgia: a 10-foot storm surge (which caused flooding along the Savannah River in southwestern Georgia, which was later recirculated into the Mississippi River along the North Carolina coast); and moderate flooding along the north bank of the Chattahoochee River near Smyrna, Georgia. At least 1,350 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) of surge inundated parts of Cumberland, and coastal communities along the coast south of Atlanta, including places including Marietta Beach, Gainesville, Macon and Savannah Beach.\n\nOn July 17, the Hurricane Center downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, and as of July 19, the hurricane moved less than 1.5 miles west of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and 1.4 miles east of Exeter, New Hampshire, respectively.\n\nThe storm was about 25 miles east-southeast of Cape Cod, Nova Scotia, by July 21, and was expected to move west-northwest on July 22.\n\nOn July 23, with storminess reduced by the pressure drop, Claudia was predicted to move near hurricane strength on July 25, possibly producing winds of 115 mph with gusts up to 130 mph, on the southwestern coast of North Carolina.\n\nAfter a brief pause over the weekend, Claudia slowly strengthened into a weak hurricane, and as of July 27, was positioned about 15 miles west-northwest of Cape Cod.\n\nThe storm is expected to move about 3 miles west-southwest on the night of July 29, and a tropical disturbance over the ocean is predicted to become unstable, strengthening into a tropical storm on July 30.\n\n\nAdditional information about the storm\n\nAt-a-glance imagery\n\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using lidar data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.

{"id":4748,"ended":false,"length":616,"gen_text":"As the teams returned to Asia, the focus shifted to the championship race. Lewis Hamilton put himself in the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst the Spaniard couldn't match the Mercedes driver's pace on the final day\n\nQualifying in Malaysia was all about getting on top of the tyres and the safety car to ensure the best possible starting position, and the Mercedes drivers took advantage.\n\nRed Bull saw their driver Ricciardo and team mate Daniel Ricciardo in fifth and second place, with both finishing on the front row of the grid.\n\nMercedes won the race, but Hamilton led from pole position with more than three-quarters of the race to run. He came home in first place, with a perfect race, and took his second world title. Sebastian Vettel's drive in second place saw him take the first championship he'll have won with the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, it came down to what we call on the radio 'the team orders' and the difference between who said what about it during the race.\n\nLewis Hamilton: \"It was a great result for us. A great result for the team. I think it's a great result for us, that we got to defend our world title next year, to keep the faith in the team, which is so important right now.\n\n\"We went out there to put our bodies on the line today, and we had a very difficult race on both the tyres and in the race. When we came out on Q3, we thought we were going to do a lot better and it was very difficult for us in practice to get comfortable with the set-up and pace.\n\n\"Having Lewis on pole and in the lead for the first half of the race was a little bit of a surprise to everybody in the team.\n\n\"I didn't notice any team orders being broken. I just felt that the way we were going was going to take us to the weekend. There was nobody shouting or anything when it was going on.\n\n\"In the end, I think it was a result, because not many drivers are at that level, and the way we went out of the race was very good. I'll take the confidence, you can't win them all, but we were very close and had one win in the year now.\"\n\n\nDaniel Ricciardo: \"We had to come over the finish line really quick, so obviously we lost a lot of time in the pit stops, so it was hard to keep a high level of pace to be honest. I think the strategy was a little bit wrong on our side, and we were more or less stuck at the back.\n\n\"You got a lot of contact with the Ferrari drivers when we were losing a lot of positions. At the moment it looks like the safety car came out for everyone, but we were a lap down the entire race, but no one stopped and gave us a free pass, so it is the same as we were in India, where I think that was a good move. It didn't result in any penalties, but they came straight in as the team order.\"","token_len":652,"entropy":[2.4605,8.4287,5.5738,0.3503,10.9593,0.5744,1.5211,5.825,1.8716,0.5619,0.8986,6.4513,4.8305,1.1332,8.9996,0.1878,5.7958,3.3194,0.8644,1.4302,8.0392,0.0898,0.6394,2.4396,0.6789,4.0783,0.1841,4.2053,0.0059,1.1348,5.1408,2.1604,0.3515,8.5137,1.5159,0.3764,0.0019,5.8101,0.0005,2.7182,1.6679,2.19,2.2603,0.6667,0.4009,2.3748,0.7251,3.194,1.5353,7.8854,0.0007,4.6619,0.0431,3.3922,2.2934,0.9516,4.7818,0.2413,3.063,3.2816,2.136,0.117,0.4817,2.5408,1.3815,2.8044,5.272,0.0722,3.962,2.6184,1.3963,2.8585,0.2919,2.0876,0.3825,2.1753,1.9673,1.9647,3.043,0.829,3.2858,1.8848,2.3223,1.6014,0.0004,5.2898,0.0041,5.7673,1.6295,4.9471,3.8888,0.125,0.0,4.3604,1.233,0.5872,0.6726,0.0004,0.0005,0.0001,3.6714,4.86,0.1146,5.8196,1.4237,1.1589,2.0558,3.1248,4.6469,1.653,0.2784,1.158,0.0076,1.8371,0.0875,0.0714,0.5816,0.87,0.0003,3.6846,0.0008,5.1766,0.6172,0.3366,1.4439,2.2481,2.9448,4.6797,2.5919,1.0839,1.0867,3.4191,6.0509,0.2759,2.6566,2.5991,0.5597,0.011,0.0703,0.2032,0.668,1.3333,0.5527,2.4789,4.8337,1.5267,1.2915,3.3555,0.54,1.023,2.1733,2.7901,4.5828,2.1156,1.7531,1.3276,3.099,1.8181,2.0527,1.6087,0.7407,0.5437,6.5438,0.0046,0.0,3.964,5.6364,1.5966,3.159,0.2818,2.6259,0.383,1.9476,1.2569,3.2957,2.341,3.2053,5.043,1.9617,0.6902,2.1094,2.0548,1.0834,0.5939,0.1833,0.0003,5.21,0.2846,1.2498,0.0262,0.1421,1.5963,0.2812,2.2633,4.9638,0.0417,0.0121,4.2387,3.5094,1.9809,4.9594,0.868,3.0645,1.4567,1.5561,4.3308,3.4333,1.4344,2.1224,2.27,5.1536,0.4741,5.1353,3.1437,0.6993,5.185,2.1905,5.5222,0.2014,0.2066,0.5556,0.8396,0.0003,2.3332,0.2257,1.7703,0.7164,2.7124,0.8005,1.4744,2.576,3.2517,1.166,0.5449,1.1274,4.8085,1.6549,1.5258,0.2757,1.1276,0.0948,0.678,2.1003,1.5821,1.9286,0.9202,1.3711,0.8129,0.6599,0.2017,2.6476,2.3764,4.9346,0.5601,3.208,2.4055,4.4108,0.2405,0.6898,1.1448,6.3943,0.0716,2.4391,4.0252,3.242,1.4155,4.5978,2.9093,0.7728,0.3379,1.4141,3.5379,1.38,3.3254,0.1171,5.1105,0.0085,0.7538,0.7911,0.0003,0.301,1.952,4.6698,1.8582,0.939,1.7628,4.4497,2.916,4.3503,0.0666,0.0014,0.0093,4.0382,1.1672,1.2408,1.2924,3.3153,0.8564,3.0369,2.9418,0.7313,4.1296,4.1341,3.0201,2.3679,0.1029,2.3534,0.4087,1.5199,0.8375,5.2216,1.5968,1.933,1.8413,1.6311,6.4858,0.5954,0.7577,1.0138,3.2878,0.649,1.3901,0.8109,0.0661,3.1858,0.9565,2.5317,0.0473,2.7171,3.1248,0.981,3.1195,1.2087,1.9197,0.426,3.1825,4.9024,1.956,0.9629,6.0373,1.2074,0.3478,3.0218,0.1328,0.0541,2.3024,5.4457,1.0185,0.4997,0.0003,0.0585,6.4968,5.0865,2.3923,0.8719,1.9288,4.6902,1.0323,0.4868,2.9305,0.9232,1.0089,2.4958,0.0752,0.0176,0.0083,1.0004,1.494,5.1672,0.0549,1.3115,0.4866,0.9616,1.9857,2.7879,3.8332,0.0826,0.3985,0.9246,2.5809,0.0003,0.0617,1.9465,3.7992,0.0003,6.2856,2.7093,3.2571,0.0732,3.2567,5.7626,1.8701,1.3165,2.9436,2.9726,1.4615,2.3185,3.6875,1.495,0.8025,1.9502,3.1398,3.5345,0.2998,4.615,0.2154,0.6746,0.7051,6.9508,1.2435,4.3857,0.6939,3.9907,5.0752,1.6056,0.7709,5.4567,2.4011,1.0065,2.3103,0.4256,0.7884,0.9149,0.0003,0.0522,3.7383,0.5479,0.4642,0.486,1.5749,1.2916,1.2138,0.4121,1.411,5.37,5.3118,3.0229,5.848,1.8286,1.9698,2.9895,5.6436,1.9503,0.3467,2.0725,1.5797,3.2098,1.8209,1.0082,2.1815,0.8573,5.4688,0.2871,2.4542,1.0269,2.1203,1.1238,0.6096,2.0322,5.149,0.8356,1.4316,3.6832,3.6171,5.8426,1.7844,0.8251,3.1829,3.1849,0.0107,1.3179,0.4944,1.8487,3.6148,1.4867,2.3811,2.5435,4.5542,5.1885,4.2199,1.8851,0.8687,5.8904,5.6182,1.6842,4.6233,0.0004,2.7824,0.0003,0.0002,0.0002,0.0904,0.0111,2.2425,1.8133,2.5917,3.9096,6.2834,0.4995,3.2883,0.1427,5.2501,1.4076,1.7359,2.4178,4.1102,1.0709,5.5153,1.1698,1.2185,0.1356,0.3007,1.7747,0.5399,2.3404,0.4967,1.4141,2.2037,1.4269,0.4276,4.0206,0.5044,3.1555,3.1725,4.478,2.5594,0.3329,0.2745,4.7299,2.308,1.7548,0.3829,2.7657,0.7958,2.2688,3.4607,1.2619,1.8885,0.9009,0.0428,3.0699,3.9205,1.2462,0.3079,0.9093,2.4129,1.4435,2.0408,5.3869,1.5034,0.0008,3.5193,2.6354,0.3077,0.1647,1.8086,0.3455,0.0003,0.0185,4.5728,6.4099,1.8138,1.9475,0.1529,4.9501,1.3206,1.2257,2.3564,3.85,4.6751,1.4994,0.7084,5.6525,1.0322,0.0825,0.0274,3.1776,1.4064,4.2858,0.4917,3.3679,2.3586,2.4839,0.2603,2.0634,3.5553,0.0134,3.5343,0.3437,3.1568,5.0709,0.8667,1.6328,2.1601,1.6843,3.2891,4.3077,1.0038,4.91,2.7891,0.0983,1.29,4.0884,6.36,0.9592,3.3473,2.9484,5.6856,0.3955,0.5269,3.6849,0.6663,1.8546,0.5143,1.4254,3.9511,4.0392,2.1239,1.7143,3.5756,2.1841,1.7094,5.9763,1.414,2.2019,3.2502,1.9682,4.3451,1.5783,1.0369,2.4213,3.4287,1.8207,3.2283,3.9164,0.0003,5.6023,0.0283,1.483,1.8136,0.8734,1.0147,4.6946,4.2451,5.2237,2.1872,4.5601,2.7955,3.3169,2.3248,3.0539]}
{"id":2230,"ended":true,"length":594,"gen_text":"In April 1955, a Caltrans official announced that US 80 would be built as a freeway for its entire length in California, as it was to be included in the Interstate Highway System. However, in that same month, Caltrans began construction of the 10-mile segment running east of SR 101 south from Santa Barbara County across the San Joaquin Valley to the California-Nevada state line, but with an exception that required the first three miles be called the SR 1 and the rest the SR 8.\n\nSR 1-10, or Highway 101, was originally called SR 60, and was the first segment to have been finished in 1957 with the completion of the first four miles of US 40; however, on 9th October 1957, Caltrans announced with great fanfare that they were ending any use of the word \"SR\" in the planning and execution of future highway plans in the US, claiming that use of the term \"SR\" would make the projects look like a new development instead of a highway, and there would be a problem with the Highway Code if it was made known that the use of the term \"SR\" was discontinued.\n\nIn the 1960s, there was not as much pressure to reduce the length of the Highway System in order to accommodate the rising number of traffic moves, the US population and the growth in automobile technology, which made public acceptance of the Interstate System even more easy than in the 1950s.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, California began work on its Interstate Highway System in earnest. In 1971, the California legislature passed the first law that required state agencies to establish and\/or expand local systems of freeways under the Interstate System, using the interstate system as a model. By the early 1970s, Caltrans had completed the I-8, I-5, I-10, I-5(SR 14), and I-310 (as part of the East-West Highway System ), all under the Interstate System.\n\nCaltrans was the original builder of SR 60 and SR 1-10 when it was constructed, and still owns them today. However, they did have to change over their own names after the Highway Code was amended in the early 1990s. Today, the original names of SR 1-10 and SR 60 are known as SR 564 and US 80. The original SR 564 is actually the old name of SR 5 and the SR 5 interchange on the westbound 20 Freeway.\n\nAfter many years of litigation between Caltrans and Southern California Counties Motor Freeway Association (SCMFAA), a court finally ruled in 1979 that the county governments must have the opportunity to determine their own name for their freeways. However, while the court agreed that each county would get the same amount of money, all of these freeways were to be called the California State Highway System, and not just their \"local\" versions. A few years later, the county governments had the chance to opt to keep local names and keep their money, and they elected not to do so by default, opting to use the overall California National Highway System naming scheme. It was at that time that Caltrans had to officially change all names to the statewide system.","token_len":653,"entropy":[5.5682,7.5038,0.2308,2.7593,9.5118,3.2665,3.0573,4.7777,0.6383,8.8245,6.6112,1.428,0.391,3.8197,2.0051,0.4347,2.4626,3.8141,5.7457,2.4143,0.1348,3.6293,2.684,1.4399,4.1213,2.9037,1.0251,4.0327,0.6119,6.9031,0.2662,0.4184,1.8477,0.2114,0.2392,0.6188,3.0187,0.0294,2.6997,5.449,0.4026,1.0888,0.2245,2.3491,0.0091,3.6312,2.4652,0.5279,1.3526,5.3339,0.6652,0.0964,1.3078,4.7475,3.2592,0.7471,5.7875,3.613,5.7336,2.7849,4.7632,1.8742,4.3813,6.1961,0.5793,2.3332,2.6679,0.0007,0.0922,1.3505,1.1375,4.0384,0.6415,1.5628,0.0008,1.2669,0.0274,2.171,4.4032,3.3795,3.2167,4.1644,3.033,3.9751,1.1756,5.6167,3.1374,0.6001,3.2461,5.0803,1.117,3.2596,3.6565,3.5641,0.4311,1.857,0.6361,0.1074,3.4503,0.2806,1.7468,0.0049,4.2902,1.4549,5.0081,2.8372,2.7785,3.7346,4.1016,1.5678,0.5684,0.8739,3.7422,2.8563,2.857,5.4199,1.1053,1.7071,0.9128,2.141,0.9598,1.413,1.6045,3.9886,2.6407,4.7588,1.5405,2.9218,5.4715,1.0847,2.4655,0.0319,0.4161,1.758,4.0341,0.8973,1.3373,4.7908,3.9513,5.7573,1.9107,0.0377,5.0717,5.1514,4.1816,2.458,0.9933,0.2005,2.7162,0.0068,1.9641,7.9701,0.386,0.0459,0.0006,0.0835,2.5071,1.3719,4.813,6.0131,3.2224,0.0232,0.3784,3.3247,0.325,0.9008,0.2094,0.8164,1.3191,6.0934,1.2011,6.0196,0.0062,2.49,1.2924,3.382,2.4777,2.0384,3.6832,1.1661,5.2346,0.3359,5.6556,0.1051,0.2478,0.928,1.2356,0.1104,0.099,2.4825,3.9087,1.867,4.5752,2.8709,1.4617,2.2355,5.2943,6.098,3.8546,0.0162,1.23,2.2492,2.645,0.684,6.0907,1.6216,0.1871,2.3692,5.2027,0.9028,1.8646,5.6336,1.0562,2.4995,2.1796,0.7954,5.8452,4.0355,0.1858,0.9849,5.1739,0.0117,0.4549,0.3231,0.5174,0.0241,0.0271,0.7185,3.5249,0.2703,1.129,0.0002,2.1893,2.1377,3.3005,0.117,0.2281,3.8935,0.774,6.0735,4.7247,0.1014,3.8777,0.8985,5.0418,0.2822,1.0221,0.0681,1.0327,3.9679,0.425,2.5174,3.4439,0.0168,2.7803,1.2178,5.9288,2.4418,0.0079,3.8418,6.012,1.4647,5.1935,5.0595,2.5287,1.9891,0.7074,3.1427,1.5042,3.1583,4.5097,1.5437,2.9437,2.6992,6.2632,3.3795,0.315,1.0269,3.8888,1.1628,3.7148,0.4335,6.1124,3.337,1.7749,0.2239,0.8615,0.0238,0.2891,2.0183,0.0002,1.7303,1.4254,2.1162,0.5639,0.0133,1.713,0.323,0.0426,0.0045,0.0996,3.5317,2.0353,4.6024,0.1113,2.9038,3.1485,0.6634,0.0592,3.1128,1.3118,1.4005,1.9185,2.4872,0.0868,0.9936,2.2559,3.9203,1.1819,1.5076,2.4473,2.9024,2.6923,1.3556,3.5051,0.7639,0.2117,3.9307,2.7384,5.4068,0.0016,2.6619,5.3136,4.4352,0.5826,2.6559,0.0002,4.8505,0.817,0.9969,1.2167,1.6737,5.7378,1.6087,4.6604,1.7724,0.366,0.5115,1.91,0.6548,3.9245,1.664,2.2763,0.5634,0.0103,0.0745,3.2836,0.0072,0.8713,1.1382,1.5337,4.1886,0.0222,3.8986,2.0076,0.6458,0.0017,1.2828,0.3158,0.4755,0.001,2.4349,0.2936,0.451,0.0011,1.3492,6.4622,2.1561,4.1586,0.4286,1.7274,0.2776,0.0021,6.1841,3.4479,5.1802,2.3735,0.0033,0.4426,4.6833,1.0646,0.0093,2.0265,0.2013,8.1049,2.9303,4.3944,0.2282,0.3804,0.3316,0.458,1.067,0.0002,3.9717,0.0112,2.8092,2.6072,3.9955,3.4813,0.1097,2.6378,3.9987,2.3054,1.5828,2.0343,0.4403,0.1097,5.9253,1.7608,0.3833,2.7213,2.4023,0.8015,5.0139,1.0627,1.6718,1.3315,0.3716,2.8017,0.0123,2.5503,3.9706,4.3768,0.5897,5.1986,4.7059,2.715,5.6894,1.1207,4.1582,0.905,3.7882,0.1639,0.4097,2.157,0.6127,2.2624,1.4774,2.3497,0.0163,1.3619,5.3312,0.1623,1.554,4.373,0.8711,0.9714,1.7938,1.8769,0.1682,0.0315,0.8726,0.126,0.0491,0.425,3.6628,0.2136,1.627,2.5795,4.7387,0.4305,4.09,1.9078,1.0494,1.986,1.9562,2.3858,1.78,0.041,1.7774,4.4757,1.7586,3.6955,2.5399,0.5787,1.3412,1.6239,4.8161,2.3056,2.0077,0.7545,2.5353,3.7392,1.7347,2.7052,2.2995,6.5042,0.7276,0.0002,1.7331,1.4366,0.0002,4.6863,5.0362,0.5117,0.2354,4.6284,2.4674,1.4162,0.0066,0.0906,5.0911,0.4878,6.3193,0.0025,7.4333,1.4664,0.266,0.7789,0.8678,0.2349,3.9908,1.6225,0.4237,2.4807,2.4332,2.9384,0.9452,0.5303,4.8322,0.0889,0.9191,4.6451,3.3333,4.1441,3.2936,1.0607,4.9279,0.032,3.3865,1.2425,0.1439,3.0561,0.5719,2.3573,1.1678,0.0006,0.9372,3.1806,0.0072,5.2225,0.8515,1.6457,3.9281,0.418,5.6934,0.456,2.8677,3.5631,1.8757,1.5538,1.3831,0.0539,0.9396,2.11,5.6102,1.8452,3.7601,1.8758,0.0005,1.1893,1.7502,0.5964,1.8295,1.4135,2.7148,1.0964,1.7561,0.1122,1.5084,1.2608,1.9953,3.0584,4.3444,5.3743,3.832,0.2558,4.322,0.2383,4.9971,2.6904,0.6983,0.1174,0.0844,1.157,3.1452,0.7066,3.7017,2.8669,1.8867,0.0257,4.7754,3.0536,1.574,7.6871,0.1971,2.952,2.5702,1.8316,3.1019,0.6293,2.6265,2.2982,3.6933,2.6214,0.0051,0.4689,0.6573,6.6568,2.793,1.884,3.5612,0.8121,2.7704,0.3422,6.1757,2.29,6.9059,0.7474,0.0112,5.3545,1.0352,0.5262,5.0505,0.9501,2.7409,1.9877,0.5792,0.2065,1.7182,0.0059,3.5991,0.8843,4.0742,0.7017,2.9521,3.5525,1.4171,1.0127,5.413,1.3406,0.9241]}

The soundtrack in Resurrection is amazing. The soundtrack for RtT:S4 is the best in any of the Castlevania games. Noted composer Tomoyuki Konishi produced the OST for the game (including most of its songs). The new soundtrack is even better. When it comes to the soundtrack (and the game), it may be easy to dismiss Castlevania RtT:S4 as a bit of a downgrade compared to games like the DS installment (Castlevania: SOTN ). However, this game is far more than just an improvement. By employing a better soundtrack and employing more interesting boss fights, the game comes closer to its goal as a platformer. If you liked the original, you will probably enjoy this sequel even more.

Instead of blocking at every attack, you only need to block once per round. This means there is no need to block in between combos. This change isn't drastic enough, but it is still an improvement over the first game.

{"id":3222,"ended":false,"length":577,"gen_text":"In May 2006, former Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled Love Me, Hate Me : Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti @ - @ Hero.\n\nIt details in great detail Bonds's abusive behavior toward the members of his family -- including his brother Aaron, and his mother, Susan -- and the devastating effects that abuse had on his family's mental and physical health.\n\nIn June 2006, four months after his release after serving six years of a 48-year sentence, Barry Bonds announced he had signed a contract to play baseball for the Miami Marlins in the new All-Star Futures Game. On the night of June 6, 2006 the Marlins played the Oakland Athletics on TV for the final time as the All-Star Game got underway at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida.\n\nAt the game, Bonds was supposed to pitch, giving the game its official name.\n\nIt was a moment that had the Bay City Mercury and the New York Times front-page photos of Bonds in a dark shirt, pants, and shoes, appearing to be very much alive.\n\nBonds, the oldest player in the game and the first player in history to have a No. 3 jersey worn by him, pitched perfectly, but got little-to-no support from the crowd. Bonds walked to the mound, which was set on the right field side of the visiting team's dugout. He was joined by the Marlins bullpen and coach Bob Geren.\n\nThe Marlins had a lineup of two former All-Stars that included sluggers Jose Reyes and Mark Teixeira, and shortstop Carlos Guillen, whose defense would make the Marlins a threat in the post-merger NL East.\n\nAs you can imagine, Bonds had nothing good to say about his new opponent. He started the at bat with a fastball that left Cabrera cold. Bonds then went to the breaking pitch, a slider. Cabrera fouled that off for strike one, and Bonds swung at two more breaking balls. Cabrera then fouled one off again. And Bonds swung at it again, for strike two. Cabrera did the same thing again, and Bonds followed until Cabrera walked.\n\nThe Marlins made three outs in the second and third innings with two runs scored.\n\nWhen Bonds came out of the dugout, he had a smile and he was swinging the bat. However, he did not make it through the rest of the game because the home team ended the inning with a three-run home run. A little later in the inning Cabrera again fouled off a pitch, and this time Bonds walked.\n\nThe Marlins scored three more runs in the fourth, including two by David Justice, and the game ended at

{"id":121,"ended":false,"length":582,"gen_text":"Ashbee suggested that given its size and comparisons with other long barrows, such as Fussell's Lodge, the Coldrum tomb could have housed the remains of over a hundred individuals. Excavations conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the Coldrum site by scientists from the University of Leicester, the museum and other universities have revealed the remains of an estimated 15 to 25 individuals.\n\nThe latest findings suggest that the Coldrum burial is one of the largest burials from the prehistoric age found so far and is the strongest example of burials in a prehistoric site in England where remains are located far away from the original dwelling and the location of the settlement being unknown. This new find has further reinforced the conclusion of the researchers that the burial was part of a large community that lived in a small community. A number of objects found in the burial are later than 6,000 years ago and can be shown to have been imported into England from overseas.\n\nThis new find is also unique in that it is the largest long barrow burial from the Neolithic period in England and also the largest burials known from the Neolithic period outside Scotland.\n\nThe discovery of the burial in the West Midlands and the subsequent recovery of the remains have already led to extensive research being carried out in the field by members of the research team. An analysis of the skull bones of the individual has indicated that he was over 40 years old and died during the early Iron Age. This is the earliest confirmed discovery of an Iron Age human from the West Midlands and is thought to be a highly significant contribution to the understanding of that period as they contribute further evidence of a wider dispersal of this Neolithic period into mainland Europe and possibly Britain.\n\nThis study further confirms the importance of the West Midlands as a centre of Neolithic settlement in England and this is supported by an array of other finds, such as the very long barrow burial of the 'Iron Age Giant'. These finds have allowed scientists to establish how widely these people were distributed across the north east of England and what the geographical boundaries of this wider dispersal region were. The results of the research published in the journal Royal Society Open Science confirm the long established position of the West Midlands as the centre of Neolithic culture in the British Isles.\n\nProfessor Richard Buckley commented:\n\n\"The West Midlands as a Neolithic centre was one of the most extraordinary places to discover in modern times and the research by Dr Ian Hogg that has just been published now confirms that it was also a fascinating and rewarding place to work in. We are grateful to the West Midlands and the research team for their continued efforts to provide us with information on this mysterious period of early prehistory and their willingness to share that with us.\"\n\nExplore further: Excavation at Stonehenge shows the origins of the Neolithic\n\nMore information: Ian Hogg et al.

{"id":1582,"ended":true,"length":559,"gen_text":"Tropical Storm Aka was the only tropical storm to form in the Central North Pacific during 1990. An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August 6. By August 7, the system had grown to a pressure of 941 mb, and the barometric pressure had dropped to 918 mb, creating the conditions necessary for the development of the tropical storm. The storm developed as a major Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 55 kt [45 m\/s and gusts to 65 m\/s, and maximum hurricane-force winds were sustained at 35 kt ], and became a tropical storm on August 14. The first update from the National Hurricane Center was posted at 8:40 a.m. on August 13. At 10 a.m. the center of Tropical Storm Aka was located at 6.0\u00b0 N 42.6\u00b0 W, and it was centered 6 miles E of Port Angeles, Washington. The Hurricane Center expected some weakening over the next day, which would change the cyclone's winds to a tropical depression.\n\nOn August 14, Aka began to move northeastward across the central Pacific. It was forecast to be a major hurricane by 9 p.m. the next day, after it had passed from the tropical cyclone threshold. By the next morning, Aka was near the southwestern tip of the Central North Pacific, with the center of the storm at 5.5\u00b0 N 15.0\u00b0 W. As of 8 a.m. on August 15, the center of Tropical Storm Aka was at 5.6\u00b0 N 14.5\u00b0 W, with maximum winds near 45 kt and moderate-to-strong hurricane-force winds extending toward the southwestern Pacific Ocean. By 6 p.m. on August 15, the pressure of Tropical Storm Aka was 917 mb at 8 a.m., with a wind speed of 35 kt.\n\nThe rapid intensification of Tropical Storm Aka was the latest example over which the National Hurricane Center lost track of the system, and it caused considerable frustration among forecasters, who felt that the center of the storm had passed over Port Angeles, not over the Pacific Ocean. The Center later corrected its estimate of the center's location by 2 degrees south. The National Hurricane Center, in a recent update, stated that: \" The intensity of the cyclone is generally thought to have reached maximum strength at 2 pm, on the 15th, and continued to intensify significantly to a maximum hurricane-force wind speed of 45 knots (57 m\/s).\"\n\nAfter some time off the ocean, Aka made landfall in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino, California on August 16. A few days earlier, on August 9, Aka had formed near the northwest corner of Hawaii. After moving along the central Pacific coast north of the Aleutians islands, it moved northward through the western Pacific Ocean, reaching waters north of Japan a few days later. In the area of its rapid intensification, it brought winds of 60-65 mph. A strong, persistent storm, it brought rain, strong surf, and strong surf hazards to coastal areas in Japan.

{"id":2221,"ended":false,"length":593,"gen_text":"On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign @ - @ and @ - @ trade deal with Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Indiana after Phoenix dealt him in the July 2012 trade. But Nash was drafted by Phoenix in 2007 and Phoenix was forced to pay him the full rookie max to keep him. So in exchange, the Lakers could acquire Nash's Bird Rights with another first round pick. And Nash had been talking to the Lakers for the previous month.\n\nIn a blog about Phoenix's 2011 free agency efforts that day, LakersDaily.com writer Josh Newberg broke down the deal. On the surface, it appears to be a fairly normal #11thpickby12thpick deal:\n\n...the Lakers got Brandon Bass in return for their number 11 draft pick. As a result, the Suns traded another player away in the package, which means Nash's free agency value can't change drastically.\n\nIn the blog, Newberg noted that, given Nash's size at 6'5\" and 223 pounds, he's not the tallest or leanest player in the league, and in any case, Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni already had a point guard in Stephon Marbury. But if you were looking for a way to get him to agree to sign in L.A., the two teams had already developed a good relationship.\n\nThe \"other player\" Newberg was referring to was J.J. Redick, a 6'4\" forward who played most of his career with the Suns, and Newberg speculated that Nash wanted to get to know him better due to their shared background as the sons of former UCLA stars Sam, then a prodigy at point guard, and Jermaine. So this \"other\" player is the one who helped spark the trade negotiation:\n\nThis other player didn't even get drafted, just an extremely deep reserve who will be released soon. So for now, we will just remember what the other guy did.\n\nAs it turns out, it was the Lakers' point guard, Redick, who had been the one who had introduced Nash to the idea of leaving Phoenix. According to the Los Angeles Times, Nash's agent was having breakfast with Redick's coaches on July 15, and the morning after, Redick had a sitdown with one of the team's executives who is assisting the team with a rebuilding project. Nash had come over to dinner and to shoot pucks over the course of July 21.\n\nOne player, one team. Nash would meet new teammates for dinner, then play pickup games before going out. Nash had only been talking to his agent, Mark Bartelstein, on the phone for a few weeks before the deal got done. As for Carmelo, Newberg wrote:\n\nThe big thing with Carmelo and the Lakers was \"how they both felt about playing together\" and how they'd \"play off each other\" if traded - and how both were free agents after this season anyway.\n\nAnd since no team has signed Nash yet, don't expect him to be traded any time soon - no matter what they say.\n\nFollow @KevinOConnorNBA","token_len":654,"entropy":[4.3058,3.4163,0.2228,3.3904,0.1436,1.434,6.2995,0.013,3.9945,3.4949,6.982,3.1732,0.305,3.6513,16.2744,8.3797,9.1464,4.6584,5.6194,3.7153,2.4634,1.0127,4.1035,0.965,3.0839,1.3185,1.8302,5.7513,8.0857,2.2609,0.251,4.0805,0.6889,4.2109,4.6372,4.4318,4.5862,3.2393,0.2116,4.4008,1.0143,5.3128,1.4572,1.1181,1.0216,4.4934,2.0531,2.6873,4.9949,0.6559,1.5229,1.4699,3.5762,0.8945,3.9592,2.1314,4.7429,0.0455,3.0834,1.7153,2.1837,2.0207,2.2983,3.6422,4.3485,1.8324,0.125,0.8619,2.8519,3.7109,3.6024,2.0277,1.1035,0.2967,4.6316,3.086,1.0837,2.0818,2.8563,0.7708,4.6284,4.8008,4.0623,0.253,0.3893,1.0415,4.2389,2.5076,3.5267,2.9084,4.0314,0.9572,0.7861,0.4537,1.4484,3.0036,3.7483,3.2822,1.33,1.0941,0.0076,2.8662,2.7489,4.8055,4.4375,4.9621,0.9204,4.2973,4.2128,0.6192,5.6567,4.2606,3.8617,0.08,4.1452,4.7789,0.2204,0.014,1.892,4.6654,4.3259,0.1171,5.6829,0.5381,0.888,2.3028,1.5328,5.828,2.2023,2.8134,0.1105,0.8108,2.8077,2.0464,0.2397,0.3747,3.8696,3.8533,5.6208,4.7195,3.8609,2.0822,5.0241,4.8507,0.3673,0.2573,1.0157,2.255,0.3823,0.0002,5.8207,3.1759,1.1212,3.7055,6.1806,1.9684,2.0179,0.7611,0.996,2.3476,5.8036,0.6178,3.9035,0.0878,1.6106,4.7525,2.2479,1.1417,0.3705,0.7494,1.8278,3.3288,6.2373,4.0359,5.721,1.5903,1.1526,5.3645,1.7091,2.8498,4.0964,4.6702,2.1578,5.3795,0.2048,4.8192,5.5467,2.2111,4.9942,5.1039,1.3046,1.291,0.0002,3.4127,2.287,1.3699,0.4165,0.3867,0.0016,2.643,0.3246,3.7458,4.0669,1.6169,0.0575,5.6039,4.0541,0.4674,0.5168,2.0301,1.2596,0.3488,4.7243,0.3587,0.0983,1.4953,3.3261,2.1094,2.5979,5.1598,1.7483,4.3988,0.0007,0.8381,0.7441,0.1666,1.1471,1.5904,1.3184,5.0955,3.768,0.6446,0.3617,6.3909,3.845,0.027,0.113,0.1841,0.0001,0.0004,0.0,3.9508,0.8822,0.9753,1.9835,0.0218,0.3805,4.9339,0.0072,0.003,0.0002,1.1342,2.8658,3.8224,1.6673,3.8388,2.7876,0.3867,0.8647,2.853,0.2112,2.2485,4.2707,1.641,3.7585,0.0222,2.3006,2.8114,1.5828,0.0605,0.0008,0.2731,1.9783,5.2108,2.2716,2.2411,4.3317,5.3634,0.3014,2.9748,0.8213,0.7755,0.7673,0.0002,2.5797,5.2955,3.8141,0.5627,0.1289,2.605,0.0017,1.9899,0.2307,0.0041,0.3259,4.6749,0.7263,0.221,0.0218,0.6348,0.0001,0.3807,1.8199,2.0465,0.0234,1.6929,0.0854,3.2602,0.8399,2.0279,5.6606,0.0473,0.2219,0.5468,1.1716,0.2745,2.5542,2.4087,1.753,5.4763,0.0041,4.4718,0.1729,1.0637,3.6918,0.2937,3.2139,2.7293,0.4205,1.8201,1.3371,6.6297,0.0084,1.6482,1.503,3.1713,2.2813,5.0377,1.3167,0.0048,1.0581,4.1171,1.6891,5.5319,4.6475,4.9299,0.8812,5.3207,0.6205,1.8332,1.535,0.0026,0.3178,0.0067,4.3275,0.0535,0.0001,1.4493,4.8087,4.8691,4.6293,0.6657,1.7893,0.2947,3.2045,3.0619,1.8352,1.2877,4.7141,5.2284,0.6119,1.7956,6.5149,2.2648,0.2032,0.0003,4.553,3.0085,0.2421,6.867,0.0005,3.2968,2.9427,2.7466,1.6995,4.5462,4.9723,5.3859,4.4592,4.6086,2.7428,4.2229,1.4387,5.1718,2.8112,0.6738,3.4226,4.3184,3.007,0.2216,2.8031,3.2389,1.4782,5.4132,4.8092,2.5223,2.4492,2.2204,1.4489,2.0407,0.8221,0.0002,3.6854,2.101,0.7043,0.0006,0.0109,3.096,0.3575,2.2447,3.1085,1.1141,2.504,0.0064,1.3565,4.1457,0.0002,0.1805,0.0823,2.9068,1.8704,2.5459,1.9039,1.3516,1.8477,5.5532,0.2719,0.0373,1.2108,2.3613,0.0675,4.012,0.5944,0.8358,2.6188,0.0026,2.183,2.1957,0.0028,0.2749,0.6703,2.0392,2.8573,0.8692,3.9354,5.1013,4.1215,0.2294,0.3415,0.0001,2.1704,7.1837,3.124,0.6953,4.8582,0.5834,2.6488,2.1218,4.9973,0.6222,1.4657,1.8791,0.0001,3.2692,1.8149,3.4221,1.8391,0.1501,7.2751,0.0345,1.2857,2.9726,0.0226,2.8111,4.08,3.4868,6.1044,1.8425,1.6954,1.708,4.0325,3.2517,1.8105,0.5788,2.2499,2.6014,4.1523,4.3965,0.4526,3.694,2.8614,3.9793,4.0909,6.3436,0.023,5.9285,0.2155,2.233,0.0034,5.1083,4.3439,2.6612,0.9725,0.0003,5.2874,4.5854,3.2119,2.4812,2.7227,2.2987,3.1059,3.7063,5.8972,7.3207,0.773,2.6836,2.859,1.2464,1.8304,3.4985,2.2577,0.9019,3.9107,3.0156,3.1392,5.1297,3.0648,2.5969,4.7967,1.2775,4.9144,0.3476,3.5797,1.0811,1.4569,2.4667,0.0081,0.0046,0.0002,0.1535,3.5492,1.247,0.2959,1.6994,1.347,0.6977,1.0044,2.2469,1.1731,3.1607,3.8623,0.6274,0.3243,4.5875,2.9215,7.4105,0.0401,2.772,3.4875,0.0072,1.9451,1.3036,0.0855,0.0002,2.0734,5.1435,3.5541,2.8143,1.1859,0.0003,3.6007,1.7183,0.7319,1.618,6.5062,2.9733,3.2374,4.0781,1.964,0.2219,4.0065,0.8727,3.7643,1.0099,1.2226,1.1253,3.3773,2.8741,3.896,1.0938,0.1659,0.0069,2.3306,2.9523,5.6363,6.7652,2.42,1.2188,3.4646,2.4302,5.9914,0.3884,1.9982,1.1354,0.1088,3.3852,0.1346,0.9569,0.0002,3.1702,5.7038,4.9566,2.4326,2.9734,3.5162,0.4927,0.8239,0.1863,6.3698,0.0012,0.3938,0.8476,0.0567,1.8727,3.1875,2.4296,0.0105,0.0264,4.4745,5.1322,0.0466,0.7693,5.3887,1.4243,0.7184,0.9743,0.0002,2.6704,0.3106,2.8463,0.0032,0.0062,0.0007]}
{"id":330,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"The Romanian Army entered the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, allowing Romania to annex Southern Dobruja ( also known as the < unk > ). Although some 330 @, @ 000 troops were involved in the campaign in the south, they were ultimately able to hold back the Bulgarian advance in the north. Eventually, however, the @ 000 units were withdrawn and Bulgaria's invasion force, which could now move into Dobruja, was forced to settle for the lower part of the region and thus the end of the war in Dobruja\n\nWhen war broke out again in Transylvania ( < unk > ), the Romanian Army was forced to withdraw, which was one advantage of the campaign. While Bulgaria moved on to occupy Transylvania, the Russian army was also on hand: it had invaded Transylvania via the Dalmatian Coast during the previous summer, and it had managed to push back Romania's forces after a short campaign in the Balkans, occupying and holding most of the region. It was there that the Russian forces faced the Bulgarian army who tried to block some of the key Russian supply routes in southern Transylvania. The Russian army managed to get supplies for its remaining forces and set a path towards Hungary.\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\n[ citation needed ] The occupation of Serbia by the Soviet Union ended with the Treaty of St. Gotthard, which marked the end of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The treaty recognized the independence of the region of Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia was never formally recognized by any European or American power and was later incorporated into communist Romania.The occupation of Serbia by the Soviet Union ended with the Treaty of St.Gotthard, which marked the end of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western powers.\n\nAfter the war in the Balkans [ edit ]\n\n[ 37 ] In the immediate postwar period, Romania's government began negotiations to join the United Nations, but these negotiations were frustrated by the US's objections to Soviet expansionism and the US's own desire to keep an eye on the Romanian military. In the end, Romania, which was represented in the UN Security Treaty, was the only developing Western country to sign a peace treaty with the Russian Federation.\n\n[ 38 ] However, after the US military intervention in Vietnam, Romania had trouble maintaining its influence in that region. While the communist leaders of neighbouring Romania refused to cooperate with the Vietnamese Communists, many of the civilian authorities in Romania had ties to the Vietnamese and had to contend with the American presence. In 1976, Romania joined the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance based out of communist Poland, as one of the two non-Communist members to do so. However, the US continued to complain about the presence of communist forces within Romania. In 1977, Romania joined the Warsaw Pact II, and it also joined the Warsaw Pact III. A year after the fall of the Berlin Wall the UN decided to reevaluate its position in the region, which in turn led to the creation of the U.N. Forces in Europe\n\n[ 42 ] In 1976, Romania invaded Bulgaria and annexed that country's western border.\n\nSee also [ edit ]","token_len":654,"entropy":[10.5665,6.4181,7.1278,0.6908,3.7214,5.0977,0.0004,0.0576,4.428,2.0485,2.7911,8.2091,3.4465,0.1582,5.0604,7.3576,4.5305,0.3135,0.0011,2.3856,11.948,0.5413,0.034,3.2926,10.1168,10.7229,1.2043,1.1113,4.203,5.3552,5.1525,10.2882,14.2594,5.7486,6.2783,10.8279,3.7437,0.8579,2.6003,0.6607,0.2721,2.4393,4.0172,1.9378,2.9127,0.4071,3.0782,0.7062,5.2177,4.5528,0.0043,2.4973,2.8359,0.6355,0.6227,1.0921,2.8635,0.7246,1.1444,0.7159,6.098,0.5478,2.2565,0.0063,0.6892,4.9349,1.3651,4.2773,0.8001,1.8123,1.9641,3.389,3.6856,4.4385,1.3872,3.0087,2.4996,5.9692,3.087,2.6058,3.2674,2.3581,0.0091,0.0006,0.6104,1.4177,4.6539,0.1202,5.6443,0.2022,1.3307,5.7212,3.0659,0.0377,0.2249,2.1986,3.6813,4.9362,2.8694,4.1064,0.0258,0.128,0.807,2.5886,1.4887,0.0094,0.001,5.7796,0.0737,5.2071,4.1453,0.5273,0.0157,1.5602,0.4798,5.335,0.0964,0.0018,0.0002,2.8422,3.3411,0.2061,0.199,0.1019,0.6715,1.4562,1.1306,0.6906,1.3095,3.7383,0.0584,1.5292,3.0276,4.0233,2.7417,4.5088,8.1419,0.949,0.5674,3.753,1.5023,4.9695,3.8372,4.0182,3.2929,1.0204,2.9509,1.8328,0.0131,0.0304,0.001,0.6017,1.3269,4.2626,1.8882,1.8846,3.8747,3.4548,7.1695,6.1995,2.3157,1.5984,3.6356,1.7982,0.0122,0.0085,0.0006,5.3336,1.2152,4.4963,0.0071,0.0376,1.1503,3.8506,0.178,3.577,2.8121,1.4353,0.932,2.9435,1.9762,4.2706,0.0136,3.7219,1.1517,3.9569,0.5365,1.0141,4.3148,1.0283,2.5507,1.9301,1.9678,0.7917,4.6175,2.9905,4.2937,4.4803,1.5303,3.466,0.0326,0.7516,1.4673,0.7227,3.9466,0.679,5.8301,0.4056,0.6402,1.4479,3.1689,4.6233,1.3606,4.3312,1.9318,6.1804,5.7,0.097,4.5642,8.0128,0.612,0.8054,5.5362,4.215,1.4013,0.6817,2.7191,4.1571,0.6088,0.0026,0.0028,0.0002,0.4846,1.4725,1.6099,1.3224,2.4031,0.0168,4.9576,4.5831,4.8259,1.3762,5.7717,1.2019,2.1765,5.5413,3.4635,3.952,2.611,4.9286,1.2801,1.2074,0.0002,2.6509,3.796,0.7816,0.0,0.0009,0.0062,0.0004,2.4408,2.8773,0.0034,0.0296,1.5818,5.6309,0.2156,4.8326,1.6996,0.5862,2.3169,0.1455,3.17,2.3827,0.3109,3.415,0.0062,4.0816,0.097,4.2455,0.0051,0.0011,1.6919,1.193,5.2115,0.1,0.322,0.0169,0.3148,2.016,0.0018,2.9477,0.1892,1.2491,0.0196,0.0206,0.3422,1.4358,1.145,0.3781,1.3212,2.2607,3.8322,0.5612,0.5019,0.0625,1.2282,3.7695,1.8215,1.1534,1.2576,1.371,0.0003,2.1594,3.3559,1.5991,5.3315,2.0319,1.2679,0.8276,2.4207,3.4808,3.3626,1.8673,1.5477,2.1249,1.8934,4.3801,1.6809,0.1381,5.8591,3.2928,0.7507,5.0392,0.0331,0.0007,0.0013,0.0013,0.0007,0.0003,0.0038,0.0036,0.0003,0.0009,0.0006,0.0007,0.0029,0.0009,5.2764,0.0001,0.0003,0.001,0.0003,0.0013,0.0007,0.0001,0.0003,0.0005,0.0001,0.0002,0.0004,0.0004,0.0004,0.0039,0.0012,0.0004,0.0026,0.0008,0.0007,1.177,0.0002,3.1945,0.3841,1.0698,2.9821,1.4497,0.3229,3.3537,0.0,0.0003,0.0034,0.0003,0.7181,4.7733,0.0027,2.456,1.3138,5.1772,2.0379,0.3517,0.1845,1.4851,2.9856,3.4822,3.6256,4.2759,1.8927,1.7707,0.4441,2.8655,0.1111,2.7697,1.9406,2.1642,1.6554,0.6555,4.9676,0.3093,0.6257,4.3325,2.3093,4.4134,0.5166,5.2246,4.1577,0.9269,1.8225,1.2361,3.7415,1.0497,4.0914,3.0738,0.4324,2.9518,4.7222,2.2579,0.0158,1.0715,3.8296,1.5981,0.5229,2.0992,1.7852,2.2598,0.0897,0.398,4.618,2.3205,1.7463,5.6012,1.5505,0.1953,0.5892,1.1395,8.4511,2.2532,1.0226,4.3149,0.171,5.2036,5.0565,1.1075,0.8867,3.3395,3.0301,1.4083,0.0746,0.2123,0.1212,7.0948,0.4821,0.581,0.6455,0.0002,1.1366,0.7082,0.0011,3.9558,0.0413,3.482,0.4597,5.502,4.7731,2.4854,0.1953,2.1078,1.3342,1.4792,3.8067,5.0939,2.1159,0.997,3.8329,0.3852,3.9968,0.85,0.6874,4.5132,1.2753,4.1121,4.9549,1.9352,6.6822,3.0898,4.7561,0.0657,3.8909,0.1121,0.2218,4.0767,2.7544,0.4296,3.3484,1.2297,0.5213,5.1064,3.8797,1.2522,1.8233,3.4919,4.1935,0.6454,0.1902,1.3786,2.9189,3.2243,2.2738,3.1372,0.0145,1.1616,4.7139,1.0492,0.864,2.1081,4.302,0.1703,1.3369,1.7245,0.2166,1.2777,0.0098,2.4202,1.6941,1.0386,0.0624,5.6754,4.4892,0.0083,5.2877,1.2666,1.8532,3.8055,3.3663,0.0103,0.6607,3.1334,3.9637,0.0534,2.4691,0.0043,0.7227,4.6822,0.9885,0.004,0.1029,1.6392,0.0064,1.8089,2.3185,2.2799,0.1023,4.3721,0.3431,1.0908,2.1558,0.028,1.6128,1.5571,4.2511,0.8358,1.3117,1.9053,2.0988,0.1035,0.7749,1.2594,0.3939,1.4847,0.0318,6.5283,1.67,3.4458,3.3485,3.1195,1.672,0.6592,2.5703,0.0206,0.3554,2.7326,5.8499,1.4348,2.9894,1.5567,4.2548,0.0015,0.1869,0.531,0.0139,4.9908,4.876,4.4528,0.3259,4.2651,2.2798,2.0451,2.6658,2.3552,0.9055,0.6819,1.0363,2.8663,4.3684,1.1633,0.823,0.1291,0.7432,1.916,0.016,0.2967,4.6323,0.2203,0.1202,0.0514,4.7983,0.1361,1.4414,3.0653,0.0002,0.8855,5.3754,0.0013,1.6374,4.9337,0.3348,0.8119,6.0366,2.9574,2.109,2.4571,3.5039,0.1715,0.5794,3.2434,3.1212,1.9149,3.4669,0.0002,3.1325,0.0017,0.0019,0.0,0.0002]}
{"id":579,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple \u2014 the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially in the Gulf of Maine. He discovered that those cod, which can grow to a length of 7 meters and weigh up to 500 kilograms, were still the primary seafood source to humans in the late 19th century. As early as 1850, he determined that fish was the source of all other seafood and thus the basis for all other food, and that cod could have sustained us for at least 5,000 years.\n\nToday's fish have been fished to virtually collapse; many people who once consumed the fish, including Innis, have had it all but destroyed. In a world without the cod, which is still one of the primary foods of many people, more than 80 percent of the world's population suffers from some form of malnutrition \u2014 even after decades of global food aid from many countries. And many people will go hungry, as there simply isn't enough food to go around.\n\nThe loss of the Atlantic cod has also caused a collapse of the cod species elsewhere in the world. Cod on the British Isles have already fallen to about one-tenth of their size, but there were no cod in the United States until the 1940s. When the fishery began to dwindle in the 1960s, fishermen moved their fishing grounds to Canada, where there are cod today, and even to Japan, where the fish's main source is farmed in large amounts. Since that time as many American cod have been consumed in restaurants \u2014 with the same or similar-looking fish \u2014 as were caught the very first year they entered the market.\n\nThe cod is not unique in this decline, however. According to a recent New York Times article, the oceans are in the midst of a mass die-off that may eliminate the populations of at least 55 percent of fish species worldwide. The article cited the United Nations International Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (ICCAMLR), which declared last November that, by mid-century, half of the world's fish stocks, including those that are commercially valuable, will have collapsed.\n\nThere is very little that can be done to prevent this collapse of fish, but people can be proactive. The NOAA report on cod fishing has some important practical suggestions: fish should be carefully and evenly weighed and then counted, so we will not overfish the waters. The report also recommends that \"if we need live fish,\" we should catch them as \"a last resort.\"\n\nThe report does not, however, suggest limiting or eliminating fishing operations. The recommendations seem designed to promote a false sense of security without addressing the causes of the problem. The loss of the cod is a natural occurrence that has happened for thousands of years and will happen again, and it is up to people to make sure that these natural occurrences are dealt with before they take a new level of severity.\n\n\u2014 Peter H.

{"id":1686,"ended":true,"length":595,"gen_text":"Fowler's career began with Liverpool. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the middle of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992.\n\nHis first senior appearance came as a substitute in Liverpool's 6-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal on 27 October 1991. He subsequently made 15 appearances in all competitions that season.\n\n\"After coming on against Arsenal on 27 October 1991, Fowler began his senior football career with his first game coming at the very heart of the Liverpool defence on 26 February 1992 where he made a string of vital interventions, scoring his first goal for the club, against Wolverhampton FC (Liverpool's opponents in the Carling Cup semi-final on 9 April 1992 ).\n\nHe was a regular fixture in the Liverpool defence throughout his first two years at the club and was named captain in May 1992. He was voted the club's Young Player of the Year in February 1993 and also won the PFA Young Player of the Year Award. As part of his development, he played in the UEFA Youth League, the UEFA Super Cup and the UEFA Cup. His first England match came in a friendly against Denmark which began on 9 November 1991. His international debut arrived in August 1993 as England claimed 2-0 (a UEFA Youth League win against Apeldoorn FC and a UEFA Cup 5-0 (a loss to FC Basel) defeat against Arsenal ).\n\nFowler's international career continued to develop at Anfield, where he made 26 appearances between April 1994 and February 2005. He featured consistently at the back line throughout the club's first two seasons, but it was in 1998-99 that he established himself as an indispensable member of the Liverpool defence, scoring three goals in a 6-1 League Cup final win over Manchester United. He continued to be an ever-present member of the squad throughout most of his career, and featured on 29 occasions in the Premier League.\n\nHe won consecutive England caps on 26 May and 26 September 1998, winning the honour after being a second-half substitute in Liverpool's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Newcastle United.\n\nFowler completed his medical at Anfield on 21 September 1998, signing a three-plus year contract at the club. He made his competitive debut against Stoke City on 15 May 1999 and continued to feature regularly, starting every League game he played in and making 41 appearances for the club over his three seasons on Merseyside. He made his international debut following his first season in English football against Denmark on 8 November 1999.\n\nHis international career continued to develop at Liverpool, where he made 25 appearances between March 1999 and June 2003.

{"id":2329,"ended":true,"length":580,"gen_text":"In a parody of I Know What You Did Last Summer, on a foggy evening with a full moon, the Simpsons are driving down a coastal road when Marge accidentally smashes into Ned Flanders' car. He falls out of it and on to the road and begins falling around in circles with Marge and Smithers chasing after him.\n\nBehind the Laughter\n\nThis is the second time that Homer has been forced to make his own beer.\n\nThis episode is the first example of using a fictional character name in this episode where he is not used as a reference to a specific movie or TV show. As a result of this, the name of the brewery doesn't change, but the name on the box does.\n\nThe Simpsons: Tapped Out [ edit ]\n\nHomer: Why don't you come up with your own idea for the Beer of the Month Club? Mr. Burns: I can think of none. Moe: Can't you think of any? Homer: Uh, there's one. Moe: A Beer of the Month Club? Homer: Oh, uh, well... Uh.. Homer: A Beer of the Month Club. [They laugh]\n\nHomer gets a Beer of the Month Club Membership from Mr. Smithers.[3] The new member is Homer Simpson. When Moe asks Homer which particular beer he wants, Homer responds with \"The Frying Dutchman\" and asks \"Is the Frying Dutchman the name of a beer?\". Moe takes that reaction as a positive response because he thinks that the name is \"trendy\" and asks Homer to get one for him. Homer and Mr. Smithers go to Humblebrit, where Homer gets the Frying Dutchman on tap and drinks it in the \"Wacky New Brew Pub\". After the first pint, Homer asks Mr. Smithers what's wrong with the Frying Dutchman, to which Mr. Smithers replies with \"Nothing, I'm fine.\". The two then continue drinking and Mr. Smithers asks Homer about his reaction, to which Homer replies \"So I've been accused of being, what was it?\" To which Mr. Smithers replies \"There's nothing wrong with the Frying Dutchman, only with the Dutchman.\" However, after Homer finishes off the Frying Dutchman he goes back to the Tap House for another pint, where he mentions that the Frying Dutchman was \"good.\"\n\nIn the Simpsons Game, Homer's Frying Dutchman is one of the beers you can get in a bottle for free in the game.\n\nTrivia [ edit ]\n\nOne of Homer's favorite beers is the \"Fry-O\" from Moe's Tavern.\n\nHomer always calls all of his beers \"Fries.\"\n\nIn France Homer mentions that Mr. Smithers \"made me beer\". However, this is not the case, as the only time Homer's beer can properly be referred to as French beer is in the Simpsons Movie. This is since no french person would use \"beer\" for a beer-like drink, instead calling it \"la manteau\", in other words just another drink.","token_len":656,"entropy":[2.7776,9.5421,0.349,7.3623,4.2383,0.6357,0.0263,0.001,0.0036,0.003,0.3879,6.5513,2.6879,8.5227,0.0498,3.3694,4.8984,1.5029,3.986,0.0535,0.5579,2.4056,7.6932,1.9976,4.0709,2.2715,0.7833,5.5708,0.8817,1.3065,3.5143,0.0024,4.3754,5.5991,0.1786,1.1056,6.4574,0.0973,0.0024,1.071,1.4649,0.6777,3.5154,4.3565,0.9326,0.9306,2.0587,0.8239,5.5872,1.0268,0.2791,1.1321,2.9721,4.7233,5.3873,6.1776,2.9064,0.9988,4.5278,2.8435,0.0015,2.871,6.972,0.0017,0.0001,3.6027,0.9928,0.0516,0.2829,2.2311,0.0006,4.9309,0.034,0.0747,0.0002,0.0256,0.0003,2.2677,1.2433,0.8317,1.6719,1.3291,1.4727,1.6828,1.0995,0.9976,5.0062,0.1498,4.3643,3.5821,1.1976,5.4656,0.9245,2.3173,0.0002,1.2675,1.347,1.5096,1.5167,0.9551,5.1723,0.1149,6.8813,1.5599,5.6695,1.2004,5.9018,1.4801,3.9548,1.1242,6.1686,3.621,1.1343,1.4424,4.9943,1.2877,0.4072,2.9104,0.2237,1.5265,5.1244,4.3598,0.7642,1.3397,0.2861,0.2846,5.907,1.4542,0.4515,2.6523,0.3917,0.2574,1.1924,2.0475,2.3407,0.4541,4.353,6.3584,0.0003,3.5473,2.1739,1.2795,0.6188,1.9213,3.7017,0.1022,4.9326,1.065,0.3178,0.4062,0.0002,1.8568,2.5468,1.8834,0.1801,0.0005,0.0006,2.8767,0.0654,0.0348,0.0144,0.0003,2.7826,0.0358,3.9152,5.2863,1.4566,0.0011,0.5548,3.5109,3.095,0.5953,2.1817,0.0559,3.792,1.2762,2.8052,5.8931,1.6649,0.2195,0.5608,0.7997,0.6089,4.9816,0.0114,0.1954,0.0198,2.0044,2.9723,3.4754,0.0216,5.6062,0.4347,6.6554,0.0657,5.1747,1.2563,0.8132,1.7773,0.0248,2.9282,1.5844,0.8314,0.0072,4.0609,0.4335,4.4551,0.4493,2.4015,1.6538,2.5061,0.019,4.1241,5.3043,0.1652,0.0489,0.0183,0.0198,0.3843,0.8293,0.0109,3.2456,0.349,4.3638,0.2958,3.1202,2.148,4.7032,6.7788,2.333,0.2906,3.4223,0.7067,0.0421,0.0175,0.0173,0.0106,1.6951,2.8423,5.3999,2.2377,1.2381,1.472,0.0002,2.1302,0.007,5.6848,1.2487,3.4476,0.1196,0.0073,0.0113,0.0248,3.9879,4.246,1.6915,0.0103,4.5325,0.0008,0.0012,4.5568,2.7014,0.0139,3.5014,5.6781,2.0595,1.6186,2.1708,1.0033,0.7538,4.3038,3.1037,1.5784,1.2649,4.8782,6.602,0.3901,0.2476,1.3061,0.3673,0.2352,2.9296,1.4547,0.9305,2.9576,5.4232,4.6133,0.1654,0.0049,2.1661,1.7803,3.9612,4.3117,2.9579,3.6636,0.5832,0.0348,0.0257,0.0032,2.863,2.5442,0.029,1.374,1.2663,2.0225,1.0264,5.2461,3.4789,6.7923,0.4229,0.508,3.2258,3.7963,4.9858,1.2797,2.7115,1.9311,2.1321,1.4328,1.0444,1.9721,4.6868,2.1451,0.0333,1.7475,0.2587,3.5473,0.6778,1.159,4.0206,4.2132,1.3145,0.9304,0.5579,0.8059,5.0899,2.2202,0.0022,0.3001,0.0008,0.0007,1.7783,0.3972,6.5113,3.0406,2.4534,2.9352,4.4826,1.753,0.9566,1.8469,1.3658,1.0877,0.0275,0.0216,0.0013,4.3842,1.3148,2.397,3.2052,0.1129,3.4826,1.6894,4.1708,5.7065,3.9556,5.3833,1.6256,2.724,0.6746,2.9177,1.9283,4.4442,3.456,0.7548,0.4536,3.1537,1.122,0.0021,0.0387,0.0008,0.001,1.6601,2.7278,1.452,0.3781,1.1147,2.0201,0.0068,0.0173,0.0019,1.3824,1.417,0.0062,0.3967,0.0013,0.0028,0.0004,0.0003,0.7961,2.6617,0.4835,3.6298,1.1264,3.2604,1.9037,4.0751,1.2807,3.8941,3.0821,2.976,0.7881,3.9216,1.2239,2.1518,3.7203,0.0027,0.0198,0.0004,0.0006,2.3739,0.3675,3.8349,1.124,4.202,2.3891,0.6187,0.0019,0.0481,0.909,1.1425,5.7724,2.5679,2.7259,1.1192,6.5563,0.0351,1.1072,5.9747,2.9268,3.1209,0.2048,3.6177,4.2264,0.0432,0.1577,0.0018,0.0022,0.0004,0.0005,0.4862,0.4919,5.6015,0.6619,1.432,0.5393,0.0457,1.1302,0.1894,0.0041,0.0231,0.0012,1.3008,4.6458,1.2943,1.4941,4.3976,0.2632,1.1338,5.4493,0.0822,2.2907,1.3873,3.0121,3.1353,0.4688,1.7234,0.0069,0.0154,0.0009,3.3742,4.0275,1.7559,0.1457,1.4072,6.4461,1.6697,4.2512,1.2591,0.8066,1.7425,2.8398,0.6343,5.2455,1.0253,1.6432,1.2224,0.0151,0.0234,0.0011,1.6162,1.5911,3.1796,2.3707,1.6589,0.0002,3.0603,1.0777,5.0298,1.3212,0.3714,0.8823,2.0786,4.0264,0.0229,0.0396,0.0015,1.037,2.6396,0.0084,0.2089,1.5555,2.6651,0.3281,1.5735,1.8421,2.9867,3.8008,2.9672,2.6394,3.4302,0.7122,3.2969,0.5947,0.5112,0.0002,2.9458,0.0116,0.0003,0.0001,0.0208,0.0002,5.9073,0.2554,2.2301,0.0133,3.7292,0.6974,0.2864,1.188,2.5076,2.8474,3.4222,2.277,1.2129,2.969,1.3803,2.8145,0.0185,0.1754,0.5966,0.4358,0.0002,2.5873,0.0042,5.5133,4.395,6.4167,1.0214,0.3488,0.8935,0.4252,1.3071,1.2838,2.0503,0.5576,0.0002,1.913,6.7484,5.7974,3.4812,1.032,5.0167,0.004,1.1834,0.0035,0.0032,3.8908,3.7463,2.3654,4.5025,1.8663,2.7929,0.1349,2.3329,0.6937,1.9615,1.3755,0.7714,1.4859,0.6092,1.8993,4.273,2.3118,0.9487,3.1533,1.7967,3.9833,8.2884,0.0276,2.4384,0.0102,0.1322,6.4217,0.5826,0.159,0.7719,0.7893,2.785,1.8431,0.7571,4.0654,0.9847,6.1113,5.6632,4.2609,2.7814,1.4536,2.7975,2.0165,1.0116,0.0816,2.5588,1.3749,0.8104,4.7213,0.4653,0.8577,1.8759,3.5718,1.9291,0.3554,0.8543,2.82,4.5531,2.0189,0.1257,2.0821,4.8886,3.6487,0.0347,4.7377,3.3143,1.1351,0.3978]}

{"id":865,"ended":true,"length":571,"gen_text":"The director Melina Matsoukas filmed the music video for `` Rockstar 101 `` in April 2010 ; she had previously directed the videos for Rihanna's singles `` Hard `` and `` Rude Boy ``, and Kanye West's `` Touch The Sky. But the video for `` Rockstar 101 `` was designed to showcase the music video for `` Touch the Sky.`` The video was directed by a studio associate and choreographed by a dancer.\n\n`` Rockstar 101 `` won a Grammy and is the highest selling artist video in Broadway history.\n\nA representative of Jay Z appeared on-camera for the music video for `` Touch the Sky.`` This video was also co-directed by Maribeth McLean, who performed on the song track `` Ready to Die with Madonna. A Tribute: Love for one more time.``.\n\nThe video shows Jay Z holding the same pose he did during the video for `` Ready to Die `` but instead of the crown, it holds the star on which he appears to have been decapitated.\n\n`` Rockstar 101 `` was directed by Jay Z, who also directed `` Ready to Die `` and `` The Blueprint 2.`` A video for `` The Blueprint 2 \ufffd, like `` Rockstar 101 ``, had choreography done by dancers from New York City's own Savoy Ballroom ; Savoy also presented the two videos together at the Savoy Ballroom Awards in December 2010.\n\nIn `` The Blueprint 3,`` he is seen riding the stage in the same outfit (the two videos do not resemble that video as they were shot separately). The actor dressed as Beyonce appeared in a similar outfit and he is seen in the very beginning of the video riding the stage as well.\n\nIn `` The Blueprint 3,`` he appears on the video cover at the beginning; the video was released on August 11, 2013.\n\nAccording to the biography, he grew up in New York City and studied advertising under Jonathan Lee, the founder of Wieden + Kennedy London. He used this experience to write with The Blueprint co-writers, Kanye West, Cilvaringz, and Swizz Beatz. He was also a mentor to Diddy when the two decided to create The Diddy Boyz with Swizz Beatz and Cilvaringz.\n\nIn 2010, The Diddy Boyz gained notoriety in the music industry for taking part in a battle of pop stars that had Kanye West vs. Rihanna. The group performed the first single off of T.L.O., ''All Mine,'' during a show at Toronto's Air Canada Centre. They were paid by Kanye West to appear in concert that night.\n\nJay Z signed with Interscope Records after the success of The Blueprint 2.

{"id":1791,"ended":true,"length":586,"gen_text":"Despite the sale of 4 @, @ 000 @, @ 000 acres ( 16 @, @ 000 km2 ) to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, by the turn of the century, the acreage of the new CCA on the Southbank increased to 6 @.\n\nWith the rise of the real estate market has come a sharp decline in the quality of new housing development on the Northbank. The CCA has lost ground to the development of multi-family residential projects like the PADL, and the high-density retailing projects like the Southbank Mall, and the Westbank City Centre shopping mall. The Southbank Mall has become a hub for shopping and dining, but with less space between buildings and more commercial development.\n\nThe Southbank City Centre mall, which is being built by the Lendlease group, is being built in the same style as the PADL but with an even heavier concentration of retailers and restaurants. The Southbank City Centre will be the largest shopping mall in Canada, however it also has a higher density of commercial development than the PADL.\n\nThe Southbank City Centre is also being built with the goal of becoming a new downtown Vancouver. However with such a limited amount of development, there is less room for new housing developments, the Northbank is being ignored in this plan, which will negatively affect the community.\n\nThe City is currently working with Lendlease to develop the Northbank and provide residents with access to the existing infrastructure of the Northbank area.\n\nAn area that the City would like to include in the Southbank City Centre would be the lands at 36 and 61 East Cordova, south of Horseshoe Bay and southeast of the Vancouver Convention Centre. The site is currently used as a staging area for trains at the Horseshoe Bay Railway Station, which connects the Northshore Community to the Southbank area. The City has already invested considerable amount of taxpayers time on an agreement with the British Columbia Railway Association. The site at 36 East Cordova also has an existing industrial site, which is still owned by Canadian Pacific Rail.\n\nIn the short term, it is likely that the City will be partnering with the BC Rail Association and Canadian Pacific Rail on a Northshore Rail Link. However in the longer term, it is possible that the City could offer up the sites located near the old railway line for a transit-oriented retail development on the Northbank.\n\nIn the short term, this kind of development would require extensive renovations. However it is quite feasible that this type of development could be built for about $60 million, which would generate millions of long term investment in community assets that would be available to provide more affordable housing.\n\nAdditionally the site may also be a good location for the Canada Line LRT. In the long term there may be a need for a new north-south transit route connecting North Vancouver, Bowen Island and Stanley Park, with the possibility of new ferry service linking Vancouver and Kitsilano Island in the east.\n\nWhile the location of the North Branch, has been an issue for years, this will no longer be the case in the short term with the impending closure of the South Branch.","token_len":657,"entropy":[1.2016,9.4066,1.0812,6.7088,11.145,8.178,4.4783,12.8775,4.2349,1.3674,1.1586,1.1122,13.2727,4.7629,10.2959,3.3499,1.3938,1.3219,0.13,7.2346,3.1267,1.2584,2.7139,11.6989,4.3755,3.936,2.4791,12.1657,0.3221,0.0057,1.3307,0.477,3.659,1.1697,7.1009,1.476,5.2042,0.0083,0.1527,0.7044,1.1314,1.2952,5.4264,0.0752,1.4411,1.6785,5.2661,5.3716,4.5252,5.4644,0.7337,4.8018,4.2784,5.7868,1.1023,3.9878,2.4164,4.0581,1.5492,0.1041,4.7445,0.7865,4.7851,0.3106,1.0904,4.7932,0.0669,0.576,6.8989,0.0829,1.3204,4.2192,2.049,0.064,0.6686,3.2083,0.0996,4.8865,1.8392,4.1105,2.3146,0.1499,3.2007,0.9254,0.6029,1.8685,3.1884,0.0227,2.5571,4.2207,4.191,0.3926,1.1068,3.6919,0.1624,4.5554,0.0614,0.6006,2.8577,2.849,3.5653,1.2228,5.2539,5.1692,3.4275,1.4788,3.3192,1.0725,5.1857,0.7282,2.1795,5.1905,6.3399,2.2063,0.8202,0.8352,4.4475,0.3116,2.5451,1.6922,2.0364,0.7307,4.9741,1.702,5.6912,0.3461,5.9423,1.013,0.2846,1.9869,3.7507,0.0428,1.1205,1.9801,1.9477,0.9989,5.4753,0.4644,3.4439,1.2858,1.5465,0.8387,2.1287,3.8491,4.165,3.3858,5.8411,3.1745,1.714,2.9809,5.401,3.9641,3.2965,1.0099,0.0002,1.2816,2.4776,0.0248,1.2492,0.0259,2.0783,2.3519,2.1084,2.0344,3.4429,0.8306,1.6055,1.6211,5.477,0.2351,0.3653,2.2009,0.3619,0.9983,3.1243,1.445,1.8229,1.58,1.8829,3.4126,0.3583,0.1053,2.7656,0.0253,0.0031,5.0018,1.2697,3.8614,2.7665,5.6769,2.1827,0.2265,4.0345,1.3778,0.539,0.6218,1.2084,2.1269,0.0112,0.8743,0.0262,1.6059,1.398,1.6825,1.3016,1.2888,0.3361,0.1501,1.6183,1.198,6.6957,1.6302,5.0806,1.1378,1.3797,3.5885,1.1749,0.191,1.9472,1.4342,1.2369,0.1675,0.9433,0.0025,0.0013,0.4675,0.8953,0.0002,1.1916,2.1837,0.0162,0.8508,0.0214,1.3746,2.1678,1.9972,0.4478,2.3419,1.7646,3.633,0.0732,2.657,0.7297,3.5058,2.6928,4.0683,1.058,3.316,3.6437,4.2194,0.4505,6.3698,1.1951,0.0062,3.4954,1.7826,2.9219,0.6713,3.2394,1.8355,0.3308,1.7521,0.5947,3.3003,2.2759,5.1824,4.7756,0.4657,1.4157,2.717,5.0277,2.798,2.5566,2.1854,2.2088,3.4357,2.1126,4.6528,0.9511,0.4595,4.4088,0.9945,0.3088,0.0002,1.3885,3.1089,3.1551,2.6728,2.5482,1.2333,2.5243,0.0044,0.0079,0.64,1.669,1.3423,1.3708,0.0872,3.0982,5.5328,3.8488,0.2334,5.0978,0.0103,2.3919,4.6453,2.5563,2.9429,0.1437,0.8982,0.0417,4.0053,0.4926,2.0201,0.0002,5.781,4.212,2.1275,2.8241,0.3149,3.3629,0.2236,0.0455,5.2538,0.3123,0.4527,3.5637,0.0123,0.9377,0.0541,3.1404,0.0404,0.4072,5.8783,3.8582,6.2704,2.5151,5.3628,4.039,2.0519,0.0042,1.5318,5.1753,0.0353,6.3829,1.4745,0.001,0.0001,0.1587,2.1197,6.234,0.0273,0.9479,3.8706,1.4527,0.0258,0.2002,1.5824,3.9642,0.77,0.7792,2.5049,1.158,0.5994,4.378,0.1953,0.1733,5.2343,5.597,0.5566,4.4027,0.0168,0.0001,0.0003,0.085,2.3633,0.9686,1.3072,2.0805,4.3619,1.0681,1.2367,1.4389,6.0455,1.1849,0.4923,2.9316,1.3538,2.981,0.3454,1.3633,1.3537,1.931,3.0632,4.8151,5.3677,4.3656,0.1159,6.5455,6.6982,4.6934,4.7432,5.0236,0.4218,0.6952,5.4813,0.0419,1.9687,1.1573,3.637,1.0116,4.4488,4.7458,0.1867,1.0431,0.0037,0.0003,4.5749,0.9969,3.0765,0.853,3.2755,1.8323,1.9852,1.0815,1.1797,5.4022,4.0087,0.0714,4.8561,0.5602,1.9015,1.8807,1.1095,0.0002,3.1283,1.9093,4.1893,0.229,0.2208,3.359,0.7105,2.4831,0.1517,0.4751,0.8961,0.6302,2.1895,5.5809,0.061,1.0409,2.5032,1.3705,0.8822,2.3394,1.9061,0.0085,0.4327,1.7174,1.583,5.1932,0.6799,1.9422,2.0,1.7266,2.7278,2.1712,0.0568,1.6297,0.0339,0.2262,1.7465,0.3565,1.4522,0.1094,0.4611,0.2648,1.1483,5.8358,3.2021,0.8344,3.6832,5.5197,4.4666,0.7697,5.4244,2.3057,3.6816,2.5732,1.9931,4.8867,1.5026,0.0462,6.1709,0.5537,4.4447,0.5501,0.7201,0.1965,0.4617,0.7966,0.0002,2.8559,0.9281,1.9284,0.0737,0.1276,3.2191,6.3027,0.002,0.4668,1.4425,3.9074,5.0441,4.6625,3.9834,1.2826,3.3404,1.2242,5.5192,1.6839,0.9561,2.0561,1.2579,0.0022,0.3512,0.4083,0.572,1.8721,3.8903,3.7579,0.6043,4.36,0.4989,1.4486,1.3718,0.7661,4.4457,4.2167,0.4759,8.4192,0.9936,3.9502,1.5693,6.836,4.1298,3.9377,0.8856,2.0901,4.124,0.7632,4.6051,3.5231,1.0187,0.1147,1.7658,0.4186,0.0002,5.6457,3.1124,4.2764,4.8826,0.9502,0.7252,2.3168,1.2466,0.5165,0.1773,2.1471,5.5439,0.083,2.6005,0.0083,1.67,3.4279,0.6633,0.9539,0.0985,5.1609,1.8075,0.3888,1.5747,1.0625,0.4325,0.9921,1.7493,4.1913,0.7066,0.0235,1.9136,2.3841,2.1981,3.1413,0.1384,2.2135,6.5563,0.005,0.8726,4.0773,0.0037,1.4389,4.1067,1.2605,2.3297,0.1617,4.5193,5.8839,1.2471,3.8053,2.7694,1.7984,4.1945,0.1729,0.0002,3.2187,3.714,0.1006,3.9252,0.5374,0.5727,0.0002,4.1379,0.9122,6.1883,0.3624,0.27,1.3797,8.0549,4.7692,5.4719,0.9173,3.9367,0.4764,0.5943,1.8308,0.1007,3.5445,3.9962,2.3504,0.0151,0.0485,0.9602,0.0392,1.9966,0.1229,3.4276,0.1913,3.3146,0.2597,4.8949,2.6788,0.0257,0.151,3.0704,0.5005,0.4895]}
{"id":229,"ended":true,"length":623,"gen_text":"The first published account of the ruins was made by Fray Jacinto Garrido at the end of the 17th century. A number of visitors investigated the ruins of Tonin\u00e1 in the 19th century, but never made any attempt to excavate them.\nIt was only during the last four years of the 19th century, however, that workers began to discover new details about the nature of the site. When the building on which the church was situated was razed during the Second World War and its ruins covered during the following three decades, it became clear that it had housed a small pagan sanctuary. A century and a half later, archaeologists have been able to reconstruct the structure of the sanctuary using the most contemporary scientific techniques; one can now see for instance where the altars, with their statues, were stationed.\nThe stone altar, found on the surface of the ruins, can be seen above. It probably belonged to some kind of religious shrine, but can not be said for certain what it was used for. One hypothesis is that, to mark the presence of the goddess Minerva, who was worshipped as Elisada at Tonin\u00e1, the altar was meant to be a sort of altar to Minerva. As for the statue of the goddess, it seems that it served a ceremonial purpose. From the shape of the statue the archaeologists conclude that the statue was probably placed in the centre (the right wing), facing towards the city.\nThe statue is probably supposed to represent the goddess Minerva and is probably of bronze cast in a circular mould. It has a head with an erect, erect posture as well as eyes of three parts. Above her head it has two wings, each of which has a bird inside it; one wing is white, and the other the rest is light green. The wings are decorated in this way: on each side there is a circular carving which consists of a cross in the centre with a circle on the perimeter, where an inscription has been removed.\nIt is possible that there was also a bust on the altar. The bust was probably used for the same purpose as the statue, as the features of Minerva's face are nearly perfect; the eyebrows are perfectly straight, the eyes are set on an unblemished forehead, and there are no spots on her eyelids or around her lips.\nFinally, you can see the carving of the bird on the statue. This animal is clearly the same as that at another altarpiece of a female figure that we saw on the map of Tonin\u00e1. According to the anthropologist V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez, it is \"a white raven with a raven standing in its beak. The bird is almost transparent\". The bird is held with two hands behind the breast, while the other one faces down. The bird's wings are closed; it is wearing wings, a pair of scales (probably the claws of a bird), and four feathers: one in front of the feet, another on the head, a third in the middle of the back, a fourth on the chin, and a fifth on the neck. This is one possible interpretation of the representation of the bird.\nI'll be updating the site with pictures of the altarpiece again in the coming days.","token_len":657,"entropy":[4.145,8.0379,3.3455,0.1558,0.7841,9.8762,2.0002,2.4987,0.3889,6.5602,2.8103,7.0709,1.2982,8.0548,0.7999,6.0312,0.4647,1.0277,0.0027,0.2611,2.848,0.0287,0.0698,0.6192,3.7686,4.4008,0.0044,7.2578,7.4527,0.2037,1.0167,2.5254,8.755,4.4301,1.9005,1.7898,0.2472,1.6311,0.0027,0.1511,0.8768,1.294,6.0909,2.4318,1.1713,2.7881,0.0369,1.4683,0.0004,0.7988,0.2579,1.874,8.2127,0.4554,1.3975,3.1094,0.1423,3.2144,5.1271,1.4555,1.6453,0.2743,1.3925,0.0068,0.0267,2.1015,2.982,0.006,0.0613,5.3761,1.4579,0.6291,4.0735,3.5647,3.5467,0.8535,0.2547,5.6927,0.2212,0.1622,1.9569,0.4886,5.4506,1.2539,4.9301,3.6887,2.0374,0.4519,3.1991,1.1556,2.5512,0.7982,3.814,0.0245,3.313,0.2238,3.8741,0.0941,0.0014,4.0079,2.7182,1.6644,4.0025,6.3112,0.1626,4.523,4.5153,0.4099,0.1853,2.0639,2.1164,1.5596,0.2229,4.346,1.057,4.9398,0.6274,3.5423,5.6452,2.2241,0.7261,3.6078,4.9289,3.0214,0.0515,0.0158,0.2577,0.1126,2.6873,2.2234,2.2789,0.6876,0.0095,2.2795,0.7516,3.3368,1.032,0.1832,2.0708,3.4007,1.7438,3.6957,5.6477,2.9908,1.2834,5.4901,5.0084,2.576,0.9552,1.1258,3.2081,3.4505,4.2967,0.5629,4.5393,0.0678,3.222,4.3532,0.3934,4.5873,1.1075,1.1326,6.5941,0.4414,0.789,1.4404,5.9549,1.8904,2.6176,4.3449,2.7007,0.3391,5.4623,0.4473,0.1996,2.5059,0.575,4.4685,0.4105,1.0754,3.5709,0.4523,1.7856,5.4504,2.4095,0.0359,5.1025,1.1868,0.0014,3.0693,2.43,1.0725,2.1993,5.9422,2.5173,0.2605,3.8157,0.8909,0.3565,2.4633,0.9851,0.5538,0.7052,0.0043,0.2245,3.9659,3.1881,0.4771,0.0153,4.8845,4.8021,4.3173,0.3648,4.6529,0.0204,0.8279,2.4601,5.2127,0.5387,4.5784,0.7118,1.4419,3.1333,5.7068,3.2486,6.398,3.0321,0.7977,0.0337,0.0016,0.1263,1.0176,0.6544,0.3808,4.9977,0.0588,0.9969,1.7644,3.4921,0.0021,2.0903,1.4941,1.3891,1.3259,4.8251,2.1972,0.301,1.2596,1.3251,1.6787,0.3602,0.8086,0.8569,2.2945,0.991,0.6644,5.036,2.4781,3.3689,0.5158,1.9093,5.9633,0.7115,3.9558,0.1607,0.2266,2.1389,4.4694,1.6916,3.0924,0.0311,2.5503,0.5294,0.7111,1.1021,3.1336,1.9399,0.8699,2.0001,7.2555,2.2906,4.0543,5.7449,2.003,2.8882,2.3277,0.1007,5.4451,1.3018,1.1766,1.0835,2.3457,2.4707,3.0393,6.7504,0.006,0.8812,1.5018,0.6557,0.2382,3.5884,1.8974,2.8471,2.1631,2.2744,4.7805,0.8879,2.8266,5.4203,1.5019,0.5085,1.9551,2.1874,0.8194,2.1227,2.1853,3.0286,3.2685,1.7139,3.6851,1.3361,5.3645,0.7161,0.0368,4.9611,2.1779,5.7938,4.8691,1.0526,5.3576,1.9083,0.7338,3.5637,1.0006,2.7749,3.0731,1.0476,3.0931,1.6953,0.4597,0.7977,0.6762,4.9376,5.222,0.7981,3.3525,2.1034,0.9511,0.8031,5.2053,0.9678,2.5128,0.1502,0.0315,5.2418,4.43,0.7312,4.9178,2.0228,0.2163,1.0615,1.949,0.9719,2.5803,3.3707,5.4607,0.5209,0.3796,2.5112,3.1186,0.5539,1.6817,0.5636,0.1941,3.7787,5.8398,3.4075,4.0097,0.0611,0.9974,4.1992,3.2741,0.5552,1.1156,2.5059,0.8594,2.9678,2.9412,1.3197,6.282,2.0056,5.5993,4.5429,3.0793,2.359,0.0932,5.9752,0.3705,1.8087,3.7428,0.5733,2.1809,0.365,4.0962,1.2142,2.1659,0.3797,5.5748,3.3839,0.2451,0.3339,1.4356,1.7007,1.685,1.9987,0.9895,4.3602,1.7747,1.3731,1.4963,0.2951,0.4848,0.0807,0.1662,1.2967,2.4914,1.339,5.8414,0.3465,2.3124,2.6037,0.2727,0.8957,5.6175,4.9776,2.9853,1.6468,5.6117,0.9131,4.0397,1.4016,0.6041,0.8501,2.4543,0.3196,4.0878,3.4769,3.2662,5.9658,1.7364,0.0006,1.285,0.5748,0.5023,2.1258,0.947,0.2601,5.0548,1.1954,0.6218,5.0001,0.1733,1.5833,2.4907,0.6047,2.5638,0.1263,1.2692,6.1884,0.0791,6.0156,0.4519,0.2175,0.7436,5.7096,0.8981,0.5598,3.1389,1.2562,0.1014,3.1928,1.5842,2.1813,5.3726,0.9917,3.8034,2.7824,1.9956,0.3791,1.5715,5.0786,5.9174,3.3764,0.36,0.0121,1.6079,4.0115,4.2342,1.4059,3.4216,3.8046,2.8343,2.1938,0.4566,6.1113,1.1982,0.5546,0.0052,0.0015,1.2271,4.3181,0.0052,0.8193,4.7842,0.9465,4.9084,0.6709,0.0333,4.6577,0.0028,0.0002,0.0,1.3116,2.1804,1.0371,4.4765,1.733,5.6086,5.0594,1.7157,0.9271,5.5611,7.0705,2.576,1.739,1.4148,0.0003,2.8243,1.1203,1.547,1.0723,5.3394,5.1671,3.829,2.013,1.2597,1.2091,5.5795,3.2902,2.3891,1.3712,4.0647,1.3229,4.4403,1.0552,3.5491,0.9066,2.0658,1.8266,5.5352,4.5618,1.2004,1.3975,1.6421,1.519,1.552,0.3757,3.0604,3.0836,1.6043,1.1943,3.0456,5.494,2.4662,1.4893,5.425,0.0159,5.5095,4.0299,2.4754,2.3535,2.9138,0.6191,0.5977,1.4798,1.0009,0.6261,5.6834,1.8762,4.9802,1.832,2.9245,1.0317,0.8431,0.2629,4.4468,0.3315,1.7294,1.2978,0.2879,2.5296,0.211,1.7758,0.144,1.8318,0.4126,1.1053,0.2459,0.0693,1.0929,0.3502,2.2909,0.0656,0.7608,0.0976,4.8476,0.8996,0.1138,0.5061,0.1048,0.6348,0.0658,2.2512,0.1265,3.5184,1.7604,4.0865,5.5312,0.3071,0.2163,0.2034,5.7458,0.5081,0.8829,0.5786,1.451,0.4037,4.7566,4.7725,2.2782,3.6057,1.1024,4.0675,0.9377,3.856,1.1092,0.3624,1.5996,0.4616,0.0083,5.9265,1.6551,0.3984,1.2407,0.5877,0.466]}

{"id":1284,"ended":false,"length":620,"gen_text":"An estimated 500 @, @ 000 burn injuries receive medical treatment yearly in the United States. They resulted in about 3 @, @ 300 deaths in 2008. Most burns ( 70 %) caused by hot objects (beverages or food), followed by objects dropped (20%), objects caught in clothing ( 13 %), and burning items in clothing (5%). Of the 500 cases reported, 125 required hospitalization, and 15 patients died. About 60 of the deaths (42 %) occurred during admission.\n\n\u2014 The most common cause of burns is falling. However, it is interesting to note that the amount of deaths have changed over time with the use of heaters. In the early years of home heating systems (1950s), only 2 deaths happened with burns. A few years later, there were more deaths (7). As a result more incidents were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the late 1970s. There were 14 deaths from fires started and heated by air-conditioning units, and there were 15 deaths from the use of oil based lamps.\n\n\u2014 Burns occur most frequently in children. Around 24% of burns are in children. Injuries caused by fires in houses are a few times higher.\n\n\u2014 Almost 80 % of burns (98 %) are in the upper body. About 10 % of adult fires (including household fires) occurred in the head, chest or abdomen. At the lower body, the main type of injury associated is the burn on the scalp and chest. It is in this place due to the high rate of carbon monoxide poisoning that the injury is usually the worst and will cause death most frequently. About 9% of burns in children are in the head and chest.\n\n\u2014 From a medical perspective, burns in the upper body result from lack of oxygenated blood flow to the tissues below. The burn in the scalp is called ischemia. The most common cause of ischemia is exposure to steam, carbon monoxide or fumes. Injuries in the lower body result from lack of oxygenated blood flow. These injuries include infections, hemorrhages and injuries caused by the fire burning at the site of the injury.\n\n\u2014 About 15 % of victims required airway pressure (pulmonary edema) or respiratory arrest. About 35 % of burns resulted in burns to the brain or the lining of blood vessels. About 4 % of burns killed victims.\n\n\u2014 Most severe injuries to the head and neck (92 %) were caused by fire. Most burns (57 %) of the upper body happened during contact with high temperatures (150 to 160 \u00b0C). Most casualties occurred in contact with objects such as metal products, wood furniture, oil lamps, oiled clothing, and oiled electrical equipment. Other sources of contact were from appliances, metal objects, hot water pipes and clothing.\n\n\u2014 The most common type of burn injury was burns on the scalp and chest. Most fires started with items hanging on the clothesline and clothesline cords. A few victims were in the shower by accident.\n\n\u2014 About half of the burns (50 %) occurred during the time of contact with smoke, burning clothes, or furniture.\n\nSource: WHO, World Health Organization","token_len":658,"entropy":[6.0996,4.3587,12.7738,9.5099,3.8385,11.2412,12.4899,5.3354,9.9683,2.5138,1.7371,6.3453,1.3633,1.8461,2.4815,0.0761,0.6173,5.579,9.9833,0.7229,3.5494,3.7176,6.3455,3.6608,0.5359,7.0536,1.3173,3.0627,3.5874,0.534,5.465,3.2545,4.6931,9.4236,1.4857,0.6365,5.4534,0.1676,1.2382,3.6007,2.2196,4.4616,2.1914,0.5007,3.8596,1.9289,2.4911,1.9441,0.0365,4.151,4.6975,2.4726,2.7784,2.8823,2.4313,5.6593,0.5705,0.579,0.2093,6.7213,0.1142,0.6567,0.3783,4.1319,5.2878,2.1275,1.7597,0.1169,3.2484,0.7464,4.6587,0.7434,2.3015,4.1428,2.9716,1.1795,5.5338,3.7301,1.0317,0.1354,1.5633,1.2825,5.2522,2.7838,0.3079,0.3404,4.9243,3.4766,6.3661,0.2672,3.8958,2.6998,4.5017,0.6818,0.0262,1.4998,2.8691,5.8867,2.1326,2.3565,0.0032,5.0833,3.3964,3.9097,0.2224,2.22,0.0378,1.8287,1.4807,5.1623,3.1142,4.6116,0.0246,4.0155,0.5536,5.8092,0.2157,0.165,0.0606,1.8366,5.8341,0.0479,5.5509,6.3481,4.5311,1.2707,0.4326,5.0434,0.8002,3.4184,0.009,4.5438,0.5267,1.5238,1.3731,1.2847,1.4715,2.0615,0.8623,6.2579,0.6076,3.1107,2.8342,2.6112,0.6402,1.1661,3.2573,3.4934,3.3551,6.4803,4.184,3.4514,2.2025,4.768,2.7615,0.1764,0.0996,0.3733,3.4835,0.1654,3.2507,1.1806,1.7937,2.9381,1.6937,4.1797,2.9309,0.1686,7.6228,5.2191,1.0529,0.3017,2.0159,0.3631,4.3992,1.8354,0.006,0.1065,0.8862,0.0558,0.6261,2.302,0.7587,2.1948,1.3101,0.0498,1.1059,4.0959,0.4629,4.8996,1.3877,2.7488,3.6409,3.7716,6.3055,3.663,0.5656,5.6507,2.3039,0.2702,0.4031,0.7346,2.1456,1.7063,4.2645,0.1924,3.6258,0.5148,0.3895,3.452,1.4308,0.0081,5.0311,5.0166,4.2848,0.6061,1.441,0.0002,0.5619,4.4091,2.1526,1.6403,1.3313,1.2149,2.2916,2.1888,5.8531,6.0052,1.3595,0.0791,2.5451,1.7381,1.8236,0.2455,2.3286,2.8331,3.5644,2.8723,0.0306,5.5134,2.6825,4.2121,1.4309,4.6982,5.4029,0.2482,1.6062,1.5326,1.3631,0.0002,0.3853,4.9146,3.4526,0.9479,0.0582,1.7587,4.1306,5.2374,1.0698,0.0595,1.0732,1.6478,1.2189,2.6262,0.7451,0.8225,3.259,3.7034,0.4785,0.5248,6.018,6.2447,2.6812,4.5754,5.1496,0.3499,0.2308,4.4453,0.3883,0.11,1.554,1.326,2.4644,1.9119,1.0412,0.2191,6.8277,1.3612,3.2622,1.0034,0.3425,2.1924,3.8416,5.0534,0.0812,1.2337,6.6138,2.8554,3.0687,2.7104,1.8228,0.0642,4.7283,2.2101,4.4445,0.4219,4.4587,0.467,5.6614,1.485,5.7761,7.3442,0.0132,0.7765,2.6144,4.6465,0.0239,5.5382,0.2334,0.0009,1.0809,3.7378,2.0315,5.5078,0.9332,2.8857,2.178,3.1674,3.2257,6.0175,2.677,2.1858,4.1537,1.9804,0.128,4.5435,4.6817,1.7201,0.0799,1.2384,2.4364,1.3492,0.9573,0.8926,0.0921,1.0526,1.6395,1.4893,0.5563,0.5558,0.0002,0.2777,6.0168,2.4281,1.9438,1.4695,0.1586,1.4575,3.4057,0.7092,1.2071,0.2031,4.3947,1.6166,5.4235,0.0052,0.2615,5.4731,0.0437,2.6834,1.2505,0.2085,2.9097,6.9475,0.8234,1.6962,4.0749,2.2474,0.1091,1.1661,1.7978,5.1049,6.0882,0.3661,0.0001,1.1022,1.3966,2.8772,0.594,1.5401,0.197,0.8192,0.1224,0.0002,0.7055,4.0159,0.0616,5.7147,2.1642,4.7463,0.1814,0.0002,1.1958,3.931,0.8773,2.3692,2.5845,0.951,0.1106,1.5257,0.1368,1.8257,0.049,1.058,0.0028,0.5617,0.4737,0.0147,0.2338,2.0148,2.7454,0.4864,1.9719,5.5037,0.7736,2.9294,0.7942,0.9662,4.4542,1.9635,0.0477,3.0162,4.4528,5.7707,4.3077,0.1775,2.669,0.6701,0.6983,0.3539,0.1274,0.6579,0.0002,0.3608,3.0926,3.7574,0.3835,0.0584,4.7152,5.873,5.7386,1.1443,5.9742,3.3286,3.0743,0.1418,0.062,0.8048,0.0014,0.7312,2.5407,4.657,3.0565,0.5877,2.6588,4.4784,0.2266,0.6465,2.4109,3.6444,0.117,4.0524,0.8404,0.2442,3.0623,2.5221,1.6942,5.761,0.0425,4.0411,0.0086,0.7793,2.1317,4.0155,0.2655,0.1253,1.297,6.0144,2.399,0.3748,0.6534,0.0002,0.4058,3.1054,4.2843,1.4551,3.6955,0.6507,1.1546,1.0936,1.6471,3.1838,4.9078,0.2061,0.2181,1.42,0.9695,0.0275,4.792,1.0476,3.6748,1.276,1.2102,4.6216,0.0735,0.0277,4.3818,0.5511,1.4422,0.0999,4.6738,3.0777,4.3495,0.0662,5.6151,1.5127,1.8521,4.4171,2.9755,4.2632,0.7994,0.2897,0.4869,2.7851,6.8048,2.2667,0.7561,5.1216,0.0195,2.9903,2.2597,0.0037,4.1803,6.1763,0.6188,3.1247,3.4978,0.4954,4.5445,1.3104,0.6771,4.5174,4.273,2.2525,0.6469,1.7359,4.7671,2.3693,3.6275,1.1279,0.0939,4.6366,3.7951,0.1922,4.1203,2.1066,3.1557,5.6934,0.9823,5.1831,1.051,0.6738,4.1027,1.7369,1.8694,1.5486,4.7584,0.378,0.7839,0.0002,0.2384,1.9864,0.8121,0.2577,2.7674,0.0072,2.5293,1.0111,1.1739,2.9418,1.7137,0.0501,0.3134,1.3186,0.2219,0.5841,3.8059,5.7547,1.4173,2.5618,4.1376,5.2578,1.1022,1.1251,2.2873,0.4589,3.053,3.4467,0.9263,3.2053,0.3662,4.3654,0.9341,3.1034,1.5307,4.6245,2.3383,2.577,6.1042,0.6252,0.6386,1.1385,0.0002,0.189,2.1855,3.1669,0.2224,0.9167,1.5642,1.1503,1.6755,0.1524,0.0119,1.5852,2.3715,0.7352,3.6438,0.8851,2.0493,0.235,5.3983,1.9163,5.1524,3.828,0.5263,1.4992,3.6627,0.3354,2.5464,0.0002,4.5375,0.1729,5.2365,1.4623,2.1692,0.0844,0.1149]}
{"id":4171,"ended":false,"length":621,"gen_text":"The Spring Garden Road main library, opened in 1951, had been considered inadequate by library administrators for several decades. The first report mentioning a replacement building was published in 1971. An architect was chosen in 1975, and construction began in 1976. A final inspection report was issued in 1979. In November 1989, construction was officially completed.\n\nThe new library's major contribution to its district is the building's ability to handle a much larger and more diverse population.\n\nThe site is located in a residential neighborhood in Detroit on the site of four early 19th century buildings. The most interesting is the four story brick structure that has been abandoned for nearly two years, with the entire roof of the building removed. The ground floor is currently used by a business, with a shop behind it, which is very much intact. At street level, a large rectangular building with small four story wings is located in the middle of the site. In its center is a large three story, gray and white brick structure which has been vacant for some time. The new library has taken over this building, so some of the other structures are now part of the public library.\n\nThe new library is a three-story, gray and white brick structure, roughly two stories taller than the existing building. From the outside, the new building is quite large. It's easy to assume that most public libraries are at least three stories tall, but the current library is four stories. On the inside, the building has similar materials and architecture as the old library, but it looks very different due to changes in materials and design. New glass wall panels look like large translucent windowpanes, and the windows have glass partitions running throughout them, giving the building a \"spire effect\" feel.\n\nThe original building housed the city's only public library at the time; the Spring Garden Road Main Library was founded in 1911 as a community center dedicated to the library. Since its foundation in 1911, the library has transformed many different types of materials over the years. The old library was used for storage, and only housed books, not records. As the city expanded, its original library facility was used by residents, school children, and employees at various city locations. Because of its many uses, the building was demolished and rebuilt several times.\n\nWhen the old library was rebuilt, it was found to be unstable and had many structural vulnerabilities. The building had already proved to be poor structurally, but additional renovation to the fa\u00e7ade and roof did not significantly improve the building. As a result, the new, higher, brick structure appears to have been a better choice to replace the old one. The new building is also considerably higher than the original, and so has more structural capacity. The new building has seven stories, a two-story atrium, and a roof that spreads the library roof out and improves air circulation.\n\n\nIn 1991 the library was selected as one of eight \"America's

{"id":3955,"ended":false,"length":530,"gen_text":"MSU's men's basketball team has won the National Championship twice : in 1979 and again in 2000. In 1979, Earvin `` Magic `` Johnson, along with Greg Kelser, Jay Bilas and Dennis Johnson, were crowned National Champions. But in 2000, the men's team did not play in the NCAA Tournament. On Nov. 20, 2000, the MSU men's team played the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. After trailing the Tar Heels 5-4 at halftime, the Spartans rallied to go on an 18-10 run to take a 7-4 lead into the half. MSU was up by double digits until Marvin Johnson led the Blue and Gold back to tie the game at 72 with 8:29 remaining. That score turned the game with MSU into a battle of attrition for over 4:40. After UNC tied the game at 80 with four seconds to go, North Carolina won with the help of a Jordan Wilkins three-pointer from the corner and a foul by MSU's Marvin Johnson to push the lead to 85-80. UNC went on to win the game at the buzzer. This historic match up provided a great atmosphere at Memorial Gymnasium. As the game ended, the Spartans began their entrance onto the court. Then, there was a moment of silence where the entire State of Michigan crowd came together to pay their respects (the Blue & Gold became known as the ''Skipper'').\n\n(Photo Courtesy of Michigan Athletics Communications)\n\nMSU's 2001 Final Four Schedule\n\nDate Opponent \/ Site\n\nAug. 26 New Mexico State (Las Cruces, N.M.) \/ MSU Tournament Center\n\nSept. 17 South Florida (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) \/ The Ritz-Carlton\n\nSept. 25 Eastern Washington (Everett, Wash.) \/ The Ritz-Carlton\n\nSept. 31 Stony Brook (Stony Brook, N.Y.) \/ The Ritz-Carlton*\n\nNov. 21 St. Bonaventure (St. Bonaventure, N.Y.) \/ The Ritz-Carlton\n\nNov. 27 Butler (Indianapolis, Ind.) \/ The Ritz-Carlton\n\nNote: In 2001, North Carolina won the NCAA Tournament in a stunning upset over Michigan State.

{"id":360,"ended":true,"length":495,"gen_text":"In the early 18th century, a tribal confederacy known as the Six Nations of the Iroquois, headquartered in New York, ruled the Indian ( Native American ) tribes of Pennsylvania, including the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga and Cayuga. The Six Nations were divided into five tribes known as the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Mohawk confederacies are collectively known as the Six Nations. The Iroquois Confederacy encompassed the most populous, populous and largest tribes within the Six Nations, but also included four minor tribes, the Onondaga, Onondagi, Oneidas and Mohawks. The tribal confederacies were named for the Great Lakes. Each confederation was the tribal state which oversaw its own territory, its own military, a large territory known as the Six Nations ( Six Nations-Oneida-Onondaga-Cayuga- Mohawk), and its own territory known as the Six Nations, Oneida-Onondaga-Cayuga-Onondaga.\n\nHaudenosaunee (Haudenosai\u00cb'we) of the Huron - Iroquoian (Huron) language confederation of the Huronia language family (Huron). The Huron, one of Canada's two official languages which is related to the French and English of northern Canada is spoken by approximately 2,600 people in the Huron and surrounding areas.\n\nHaudenosaunee (Haudenosai\u00cb'we) as they were known through the 17th and 18th centuries are a people of the Six Nations language, their religion is the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and their culture is the Haudenosaunee, a group of religious, socio-political and cultural people, known as Huron-Iroquois (Huron) Native Americans, living in North America. The Six Nations confederacy is an American confederation composed of the Haudenosaunee, the Huron-Iroquois, the Onondaga, Cayuga, Oneida, and Seneca; and their various bands. The six tribes were given their regional names from the area they lived in and their respective tribes are named after particular lakes in the Great lakes region of Canada. The Huron were found near lake Huron in Ontario ; the Seneca along lake Ontario in Ontario, on the border of Michigan and Ontario. They had a confederacy over the Seneca Reservation. The Onondaga, along the shores of Lake Ontario, in upstate New York. Many of the Onondaga bands were part of the Iroquois Confederacy and so were more directly allied with the Iroquois tribes of the Great Lakes region. The Cayuga and Oneida were found in Ontario and western New York near Lake Huron. The Huron confederacy also incorporated many of the smaller tribes located near Lake Superior such as the Wampanoag and the Oneida.\n\nIt is the main purpose of this page to provide a more complete understanding of the Haudenosaunee culture and to preserve and preserve the culture (including its language) for the future generations.","token_len":658,"entropy":[1.7422,3.9494,6.176,0.2157,0.0858,0.2424,2.6898,9.712,5.7683,1.9161,0.0177,1.8858,0.0241,0.1176,5.1841,0.0462,1.6969,0.058,0.097,0.0055,0.0034,2.6701,6.2558,0.3557,2.1159,0.0094,1.0737,6.151,1.513,5.1066,8.1691,10.1433,0.3954,1.6853,3.1312,1.0434,5.4855,0.5358,5.7532,0.404,2.2234,0.1346,0.4465,0.6245,0.0567,0.1156,0.3387,0.0131,0.0103,1.462,0.7984,0.0024,0.3385,1.4761,1.2198,0.019,1.6419,3.6202,0.1657,2.4602,1.9333,3.9546,0.1842,0.3024,1.4806,0.0666,0.5634,0.0544,0.5562,0.0027,0.0049,1.4571,0.9635,1.165,2.303,0.0842,1.1135,1.6142,0.0121,0.0012,0.5125,0.872,0.0132,0.6678,0.1846,0.0054,0.338,3.008,0.9805,3.7693,0.0016,0.5877,3.2372,1.8957,0.3797,0.0794,0.0816,0.658,0.0117,1.1623,1.3446,1.4771,0.0027,0.0091,0.3926,5.5822,0.004,1.3006,4.6718,1.3686,3.2234,2.3254,0.6667,3.7451,1.5743,3.7923,0.1379,1.5854,0.0094,2.0418,4.3731,2.1984,0.5532,6.1325,4.4606,0.2397,1.7462,1.1139,2.2796,0.1281,0.0756,0.302,1.2867,0.269,7.0784,0.2702,2.8364,3.7121,0.3355,2.3144,0.3263,0.3131,1.153,6.2441,0.8315,0.0549,1.4166,1.1391,4.48,1.6319,0.5231,4.6278,0.8143,2.9428,4.5422,0.9112,1.6251,1.1645,4.9262,5.5349,5.3031,5.1323,4.3889,1.501,0.4762,1.708,1.5629,3.9504,0.1446,3.8483,0.6469,4.1286,4.8669,3.8103,2.1093,0.0097,0.5795,1.8459,0.0271,3.4975,3.8548,0.0731,4.187,4.6689,0.0183,2.1703,1.2984,0.0403,0.0057,0.6977,0.319,0.001,0.0191,0.4113,2.0126,0.0281,2.082,0.6015,2.3167,0.0563,3.8863,0.5958,0.0035,0.2667,0.6413,0.0171,4.8621,3.3683,0.021,2.1184,0.3665,0.0101,0.004,0.3199,0.1796,0.0023,0.0291,0.2166,2.7934,0.0221,0.0326,1.2551,1.6481,0.0557,5.3824,2.0084,0.0015,0.0001,0.0001,1.7989,1.858,0.0531,0.6253,3.7769,5.4957,2.1819,3.9151,2.2499,1.0545,4.5984,0.4644,3.5707,0.0468,6.3139,1.9643,0.0026,1.337,0.0041,2.0588,0.4095,0.1455,1.6848,1.5146,2.853,0.7572,2.0114,0.6124,1.9683,6.1241,4.8731,0.8173,3.6281,0.5488,0.2129,3.0885,1.0844,1.1624,0.3548,3.7239,3.6614,0.0108,5.1998,0.0527,2.3459,0.6393,0.3498,7.3056,1.4916,3.8856,0.0455,1.1134,2.9629,1.672,0.6355,1.9622,3.8751,2.35,6.0228,1.65,0.3887,1.4528,3.1884,0.9963,3.2496,0.7149,0.9523,1.5606,1.7448,0.0707,3.5253,5.0398,1.0916,0.7644,2.0934,0.0002,2.28,0.387,0.0093,0.0398,0.0008,0.4414,0.137,0.0045,0.0144,0.013,0.0359,0.0007,0.0113,0.0045,0.0614,6.8847,2.706,1.9633,0.6407,5.6566,0.562,2.7703,0.0897,0.7783,0.0928,0.0008,0.1566,3.1027,1.788,2.6367,1.0406,0.5086,2.9175,0.0148,5.6946,2.8108,4.1585,4.1611,1.6284,1.586,1.4561,0.0016,0.0031,0.1879,0.0061,1.7969,2.2647,0.8375,2.5734,0.259,2.0373,0.6506,0.0009,0.0067,0.1073,0.0004,4.5313,2.0187,4.5643,0.0752,3.0424,1.4426,6.5376,0.0223,0.4016,0.7176,0.6636,6.0076,3.0752,3.8325,1.1836,3.6856,0.6574,1.2175,1.058,0.0009,0.002,0.109,2.5189,0.4963,0.2108,1.7984,5.5774,0.3159,2.0163,2.2154,0.481,3.0264,0.1479,0.681,1.3391,3.2826,0.0216,3.3752,0.2182,0.0267,1.3121,3.346,5.009,2.9472,0.3632,3.7576,0.0305,0.7115,4.2573,0.0002,0.0007,0.0619,0.0001,1.5437,1.627,1.8162,0.105,1.1008,0.2373,0.0001,0.0018,0.0252,0.9739,0.3972,1.6732,0.0669,0.0048,0.5482,2.3188,0.0058,0.33,1.2158,0.0038,0.7831,0.9593,3.6538,0.0008,5.7352,2.7815,3.0049,4.4498,2.7813,1.6371,1.0,4.3266,1.0496,2.1164,4.9031,1.8787,6.279,0.5964,2.9792,0.4399,4.5523,1.4343,1.7846,0.2059,2.6265,1.9982,3.2669,3.105,2.8609,3.6837,0.6117,6.6728,1.7875,2.7969,0.4943,1.1162,3.1588,0.49,1.5391,1.9262,0.3967,1.2185,1.7131,0.3051,4.1147,5.4596,4.4488,4.3771,0.5894,0.0003,0.9299,1.0902,8.2428,0.2272,2.5349,0.0206,4.6401,2.0197,0.2264,0.9335,3.0514,1.9042,5.6251,0.4404,3.5318,1.0611,2.3827,0.2085,2.2361,3.0317,3.7295,4.107,1.4259,3.835,0.463,0.0049,6.9017,0.9407,2.3325,0.0062,4.9409,0.0019,2.7319,0.3121,0.6439,0.0242,0.0121,2.3344,2.3757,1.3811,2.7297,0.0138,0.2522,0.0599,0.9833,1.5547,2.5667,0.0009,0.0075,0.0002,1.2081,7.0779,1.009,0.4514,0.8071,0.03,0.0546,3.3382,1.2354,3.7275,0.007,0.1856,1.1751,0.002,0.1061,0.2334,2.2559,5.5429,1.1933,6.6206,3.7607,3.1859,0.4115,0.2182,0.8787,0.005,0.0199,4.6523,1.5257,0.9408,3.7663,0.179,0.7094,0.4291,0.2916,1.428,0.0268,2.0965,1.6839,0.0209,1.105,1.3088,0.909,4.008,1.08,4.8596,0.085,0.0001,3.9085,0.7552,3.2757,0.0005,0.7354,0.8982,2.0401,0.0896,4.4832,0.0213,0.0028,3.7535,5.1945,3.2986,1.3295,0.0755,3.8227,1.6233,5.2527,3.1671,2.4056,1.7034,2.9106,0.0077,0.0528,4.08,0.9176,0.0008,0.0534,1.3211,0.6187,1.1999,0.1249,0.6372,1.3874,0.0002,5.3775,0.502,3.1437,5.0132,3.0685,0.0588,0.6587,1.5464,0.0952,1.6461,1.2698,4.157,1.5962,1.3549,0.1018,0.1984,2.0688,0.0005,0.002,0.0086,0.0002,4.08,0.8672,2.3831,5.568,2.2203,2.3441,0.7558,2.44,7.5436,4.3427,1.8155,1.1912,0.5117,1.4007,1.687,0.7685,1.192,0.7892]}
{"id":3375,"ended":false,"length":610,"gen_text":"During the time of its release, Illmatic brought a renewed focus on lyricism to hip hop \u2014 hearkening back to the heyday of Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, and Rakim. \"Bustin' My Crank\" introduced listeners to Illmatic's narrative, his own struggles as a hip-hop artist, and how those struggles were reflected in the story of the city he called home. As with many classic singles, the original is available right now on iTunes for just $4.99.\n\nIt also turns out that he's still rapping. Check out these snippets from a handful of new songs, taken from an interview he did with HipHopDX earlier this week. Illmatic will be reissued on October 11th via Atlantic.\n\nCheck out the full interview:\n\nOn being a member of the Game:\n\n\"He's another one that I've known from the city. I'm talking about the people that really started hip hop and got the whole 'hood\/gangsta, hoodie, whatever' thing going.\n\n\"My relationship with him goes back about 15 years. This might sound crazy, but he wasn't really on the West Coast at the time. I met him at a party, and he had some music on. He didn't know where the hell to even start. When I went, he was already on the album. He had already started mixing the beats. At that point, it was me, him and DJ Premier. Everybody wanted on there but me and DJ Premier.\n\nWhen Nas came on as a solo artist, he knew Nas. What happened was like two different groups of producers got on Nas. It was a lot of producers that came and went. The way it went, you're still looking for somebody who's going to know his shit, who can give you their opinion on what's supposed to be on that album. So, Nas took the mic. He knew his relationship with Nas; he knew the history. He was somebody who could tell me, 'I hear this and y'all are going to say, 'Yeah, we could bring this in.' If you want, you could bring it in at any given time. I mean, you did it. What was that? I heard 'Nastradamus' \u2014 he had some of my beats on his album \u2014 and he goes, 'Well, now I'm going to make this.' I'm like, 'Yo, I didn't really want this kind of shit.' Nas just went in there and took what, literally, he had. He was the only one.\"\n\nOn the importance of the \"N\" word in his career:\n\n\"Listen, I'm doing something that I've wanted my whole life. I'm talking about all of these streets that I grew up on \u2014 there's three of them \u2014 and making sure those streets remain real for them. Those streets are not for a certain type of people, and that's what I want my kids to know about. They know the realest, best, most true, real shit. That's what my father's looking for in a man.

{"id":830,"ended":false,"length":571,"gen_text":"Plum cake has historically referred to an early type and style of fruitcake in England since around 1700. Raisins and currants were used, which in the English language were referred to as plums and currants. Currants were known to be edible, though the variety used was not known in England and therefore most people did not eat currants.\n\nAn interesting story about the origin of the word comes from the 1694 work, William Caxton's Proverbs and allusions [ edit ]\n\nThis is yet another instance wherein the good author has omitted allusion to the word-currant.\n\nHe says, that the true currant-wine has no colour of any kind; and that he never tasted it but for fear it would cause his eyes to be deceived. This wine which his mother is always accustomed to make with milk and water, is made in another manner; and he says, that this was her own invention, for she says, 'that she never got the taste of wine till it was so well refined in her son's body, that she could have made some of it for him without any other liquor; and that she is so well able to make it with so little as some water; and that this is the true currant-wine; having very little of the colour of the true currant, nor any flavour of it which is so different from the true currant-vinegar... So that 'tis not likely that the true currant-wine is found in my garden'. Caxton's Proverbs and allusions, London, 1694. p. 14. The first line of the passage reads: \"The true currant-wine has no colour of any kind\". The following 15 lines also contain a reference to \"currants and their sweet cherries\" but with an alternative spelling: \"Currants and their Sweet Cherries\".\n\nIt is clear that this is not where the word currant comes from, however. Currants are known as a sweet fruit, having thick clusters of yellow, pink and green berries. It is commonly considered that the traditional currant-wine was made using currants. If that is the way of making the wine, then currants and the fruit would have been used as a major ingredient. Therefore, the name \"curd\" would not be a possible guess at its origins. Additionally, the modern definition of \"currant\" is not the same as a real currant species, which is a member of the daisy family. The term currant is a British term with no place in modern American English.\n\nCurd was in use in Britain as early as the 16th century and in India in Ancient Greek, and Arabic of Persian, Arabic and Portuguese for centuries earlier.\n\nOne very early reference to currant can be found in the British Encyclopaedia of Plants, page 779:\n\n\"Curd or currant was the best beverage of the time; a little was taken with wine - and currants were one of the ingredients.\"\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nWilliam Caxton - English Proverb and allusion: a compendium of allusions and quotations [ edit ]","token_len":659,"entropy":[5.7657,7.528,4.6347,7.868,8.579,0.0211,3.7115,3.6899,5.0831,7.6608,5.2937,0.0649,3.5035,2.1281,4.5113,2.1991,7.4062,3.5744,4.0324,0.6744,10.9107,3.2759,0.0051,1.802,2.734,0.0046,0.7461,2.1123,3.0503,4.1419,4.0495,2.1853,5.0515,3.0889,3.2098,3.4607,0.0258,0.0548,4.4316,0.1252,1.5159,0.8923,0.0533,0.5349,6.2119,0.0746,0.8794,3.9754,1.5307,0.5135,4.2642,1.4518,3.6481,2.6158,5.031,2.4013,1.2525,1.3772,2.3149,3.1945,1.8003,3.3995,3.4238,4.8872,2.5474,2.2758,0.0021,1.1569,2.4617,0.0508,0.6843,1.766,0.0175,5.5224,3.0794,3.6971,1.5371,0.9813,1.0475,0.0294,0.4754,1.2725,4.2191,0.049,1.1101,4.0146,5.1397,3.6262,2.064,5.4382,3.277,0.0779,0.2052,5.8439,1.2315,1.4298,6.1202,1.5259,6.4901,4.9121,0.0148,0.0133,0.0002,4.449,1.7117,6.0718,0.4428,1.7896,5.1386,1.2696,5.5104,3.23,1.9491,5.4199,3.0292,4.7204,0.3839,0.8066,3.9613,5.9405,4.0372,0.0923,1.6094,1.8885,0.0001,4.3404,2.8248,1.3937,2.3508,1.553,4.2824,2.1577,0.1398,3.4932,4.8952,4.2526,2.7028,3.9572,2.5664,1.8282,1.0217,1.6206,1.4777,0.9012,4.263,2.7181,1.3341,1.4096,3.3816,5.2476,5.3345,2.403,1.8641,3.9918,1.5653,1.4241,0.0657,2.0349,5.4828,0.8148,3.0234,5.103,5.5821,5.0191,3.158,5.4822,3.7953,5.0281,0.0204,0.5799,3.072,4.8138,1.1946,2.8651,0.3298,1.3884,3.2376,2.4807,5.3105,1.2137,2.1838,1.1144,3.1868,1.8418,1.2094,0.3993,3.006,3.9468,5.4128,3.4823,1.1624,0.7419,3.0447,1.26,3.7071,1.1322,2.7467,1.7661,1.3138,1.4708,5.5983,1.9394,2.3694,0.2161,2.7045,1.8795,2.9232,0.6485,4.376,2.4718,5.9946,2.9657,1.0825,3.5696,0.4228,3.178,0.6716,0.3827,1.336,0.8955,4.1469,4.3279,5.8379,1.9495,0.1839,2.905,2.017,2.4338,1.604,3.015,3.5382,3.0074,1.4867,1.0639,1.3847,3.9021,2.8785,2.985,4.3568,0.2287,1.264,0.7418,2.8977,4.2684,0.3938,4.2372,5.5554,2.6391,3.7945,1.0732,0.4119,3.4189,1.3549,1.077,2.3106,0.7893,0.0122,0.6256,0.0228,2.6317,6.4981,5.551,0.7419,2.1194,0.6032,1.5555,0.5104,1.5024,2.3779,0.5362,0.1457,0.9823,3.7061,0.6748,4.182,1.0044,0.7759,7.0746,1.3669,3.6583,4.9936,0.1104,1.1207,1.4439,0.5094,0.0141,1.1832,5.1094,0.3986,6.318,5.5522,0.8753,5.9826,0.038,2.0855,2.9769,0.8856,1.7063,1.9784,0.0785,0.0191,0.341,0.0254,1.9108,5.0191,0.5377,6.2636,3.2598,4.7583,5.9772,0.0022,1.7671,0.9415,0.0143,0.2144,0.1,0.0104,1.6668,3.3809,0.6629,0.3884,0.0191,1.5754,3.4398,0.1064,5.1152,0.9096,3.6927,3.3098,3.4364,1.4001,0.6525,2.7179,2.9983,1.1326,0.7809,2.505,0.2144,0.0443,0.0019,0.0856,0.0028,0.3185,0.0139,0.0081,0.0177,0.0014,0.0124,2.0312,1.5926,4.0291,6.2413,0.1626,5.1869,1.8931,2.5347,0.942,0.0197,1.798,0.6279,1.1763,1.6244,6.789,5.9994,5.8112,0.0032,2.3609,3.1469,3.972,3.6899,3.7448,1.4823,1.9508,0.3022,1.5221,0.3242,0.2501,0.3183,5.3042,0.1239,0.0014,0.8709,1.0527,0.0001,3.9424,0.6019,4.1345,0.6272,2.8978,1.9722,1.8246,6.3546,0.5235,0.8058,2.6657,0.032,1.3916,0.0038,1.4211,3.9519,1.4575,1.7747,0.4466,1.3005,3.3057,2.0288,1.6118,3.096,0.7555,1.456,5.3548,6.2509,5.9353,0.4015,3.7072,2.0274,2.4938,1.5934,3.2589,2.402,0.6809,3.0314,0.3813,4.7002,4.1231,1.0053,0.8449,6.1063,2.5656,0.154,1.5434,0.1093,1.3215,0.7284,3.8542,1.6982,0.0478,1.7759,5.0794,3.3678,0.537,0.6366,5.6831,4.667,0.6855,1.2688,0.3484,0.207,0.6855,2.6765,0.1954,1.9731,3.5248,3.2314,2.2285,1.0887,0.6441,1.6957,1.6334,1.7044,4.6957,0.2827,1.0227,4.4558,0.3184,1.1537,3.6941,1.2569,2.9699,1.582,0.4463,2.2194,1.7984,1.0197,1.831,4.1153,5.4682,2.7694,4.1606,2.443,0.2866,6.6181,0.0228,1.1595,4.9286,4.0512,0.1091,1.289,1.8313,0.0396,0.0783,1.0834,2.081,2.3458,0.6928,0.085,4.2381,4.976,1.8424,0.0094,5.3454,1.333,2.0644,1.1208,1.246,2.3702,0.0048,0.0754,5.7601,0.0015,0.0335,0.4719,1.8351,3.1065,3.3307,0.048,0.8822,2.1931,5.3365,1.6354,4.9422,1.0675,5.7132,0.1126,4.0994,4.9188,0.5784,0.4687,0.6868,0.0002,3.0876,1.5691,3.8964,4.309,0.8311,1.1287,3.141,1.9283,0.4274,0.0066,0.4907,1.6751,0.071,0.062,2.0792,3.1729,6.3181,2.6965,7.0966,3.0643,2.5836,3.0968,3.8088,6.3719,5.0639,2.5767,2.5368,0.8515,5.0467,5.5976,2.367,5.2658,0.4851,1.9382,0.0001,5.6512,5.7241,2.1224,1.4726,0.3086,0.8375,0.9221,4.9435,0.0369,0.0961,0.1,0.9084,5.6902,5.142,0.0592,0.1376,0.0,1.3142,2.9837,1.3747,4.9629,3.356,4.5514,1.5052,0.6245,0.0002,2.3421,1.4883,0.3895,2.8723,0.4494,0.5307,3.9889,2.1779,5.5558,5.3177,1.4072,0.7352,2.065,2.6612,3.8638,3.7702,2.9706,3.1866,1.9134,3.108,7.5111,2.8582,4.8029,0.4025,1.0542,5.1812,0.0971,0.0911,3.8596,1.624,0.2041,0.0002,5.5506,0.0925,0.0001,0.0001,0.6128,0.0003,1.9316,0.0038,0.0078,0.0,0.0003,0.7109,0.0003,5.5091,0.0193,0.0002,2.7127,3.0468,2.2448,0.6722,1.6951,1.4645,1.1972,2.7161,2.6259,4.327,0.1761,0.372,2.2293,1.0159,1.1579,1.9413,3.9272,0.6761,0.0009]}

{"id":785,"ended":false,"length":583,"gen_text":"Key : Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, D = Draws, T = Ties, A = < unk >, Bat = Batting points, < unk > = Runs batted in, Lb = Long balls, Bb = Bats bunt, Rd = R runs, K = Ks, Blk = Blows, Pl = Plcrs, C = catches, St = Stolen Bricks, Stl = Stolen Runs and Cos = Ground Scores.\n\nThese are the main stats used to describe a batsman and it is interesting to see the amount of variation that has occurred in our batsmen over the years. There are a couple of reasons for this. For one it has to do with our batting line-ups. As we have said, this has not changed much over the years. One example of another stat that is probably more interesting is Total Games played (Tggames), which indicates the total number of matches that batsmen have faced. It can also be calculated using the formula Tggames = Tgbase \/ (Tgrun +Tgbase). Interestingly, Tgbase \/ Tgrun can give further insight as to a batsman's consistency over time. This is shown when (Tlgruns) < Tgruns, because the batsmans consistently scored fewer runs than their opponents in Tgruns.\n\nFinally we have Batting accuracy, which is the average number of runs per bat that is hit by a batsman at a particular stage of an innings. This gives insight into how well a batsman can hit the ball. For instance, at number 5 he scores less than the average number of runs scored by all batsmen. The above table shows that on average a batsman scores approximately 10 runs per match at the top of the order and at the bottom.\n\nThis graph shows that if we look at the batsmen's performances from different different innings of an innings, we can see the distribution of runs. The batsmen often seem to be struggling in the second innings of an innings, for instance, for which they tend to drop quite a few runs, because of the difference between their batting average and the average runs scored by all batsmen (between 2 and 4). The overall graph on the right, which is based on my personal statistics from batting stats is shown below:\n\nWhat should we take away from all this? First, that we need to pay more attention to the batting stats to get a clearer picture of what a batsman is capable of. This is because some of these stats only give us an estimation of what the batsman is capable of and they often do not tell us everything we require from a batsman. Secondly, the graph shows the distribution over a batsman. It can give us clues as to which batsmen have been able to score big runs in certain innings, which batsmen score low runs in certain innings. This is the beauty of statistics. Statistics can also help us judge a batsman's form.\n\nReferences \u2013\n\nWickramasinghe, R. (2003). The Big Score Book of Cricket Records & Statistics: (c) 2001.

{"id":1468,"ended":true,"length":568,"gen_text":"Cayuga County, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York, has a highly unorthodox shape. Most of the county is only about 15 miles ( 24 km ) wide from its west coast to its east coast, although there is a few large islands.\n\nThe primary geologic features in the county are the North American and the Cascades glaciers, several volcanoes (including Mammoth Mountain, which is part of the Cascade Range), and numerous man-made and natural sand dunes.\n\nThe county is bordered on four sides by Lake Erie and on three sides by Lake Ontario, Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Niagara River and the State of New York.\n\nA unique geological feature in the Cayuga County is the Erie Fault, with a series of parallel faults which intersect along the western side of Lake Ontario and plunge up more than 80 feet ( 25 meters) deep into the valley floor.\n\nThis large natural depression, called the Bay, is a popular day-use area for boaters and picnickers. Other popular activities are hiking on the trails in the Finger Lakes region.\n\nThe village of Green Creek is about 8 miles (13 km) north from the county's northwest border with Cattaraugus County.\n\nThe most popular recreational site in the county is the Cayuga County Park, located 5 miles (8 km) west of Cayuga City. It is a short walk along a wide grassy meadow and on paths.\n\nThe area's main attraction is Lake Erie, located 1,075 miles (1,900 km) away. The state park also has access to a picnic shelter and picnic pavilion.\n\nThis large inland sea, which is about 200 miles (320 km) long, is in effect surrounded by the county on three sides. One is the Cascades, a tectonic plate that pushes eastward along the eastern boundary. Another is the North American Plate, which moves westward through the center of the sea. In the west, there is the Great Lakes and Lake Ontario. In the East, there is Lake Erie.\n\nThe Finger Lakes are bordered, on three sides, by Lake Erie. Two of the counties border the lake: Cayuga and Tioga (part of Monroe County) and Onondaga. But the largest county lies between Erie and the Great Lakes: Cayuga.\n\nThe Finger Lakes region has a unique geologic history, dating back to the Precambrian Era -- more than 4 billion years ago.\n\nThese are the first articles in Geoscience Today, a new electronic publication devoted to geoscience. Each issue includes one to four articles that explore key issues in geoscience -- climate change, global warming, volcanoes, water management and natural hazards -- and focuses on interesting and challenging areas that are not covered by other geoscience sites. New content is added twice a month, covering new developments in geoscience.\n\nGeoscience today also features regular columnists and special events from the editorial staff of EarthTechling magazine, a monthly publication that focuses on sustainable energy technology.\n\nFor detailed information, please contact the editors at geoscience[at]earthtechling.com.","token_len":660,"entropy":[7.8626,3.4591,2.5169,1.9638,7.0021,0.8074,1.0212,6.2944,0.0041,0.2553,0.3529,0.6204,0.0001,0.7871,1.7944,1.9451,7.3064,8.0787,9.1477,0.922,5.3484,0.9566,0.4189,1.4371,0.6518,5.8385,1.9105,3.7364,0.3061,4.7626,10.8034,0.6309,0.3064,2.0194,5.7548,5.3598,4.2341,1.564,0.3229,0.2257,0.2289,0.3204,0.764,4.4945,1.9579,1.461,0.5473,3.6749,2.9364,1.683,1.3421,1.8739,0.0023,1.17,5.763,4.3354,0.5665,1.5806,1.8706,0.5519,0.8556,0.2999,1.326,4.3902,1.0348,1.4566,2.7247,3.6073,0.414,0.4347,4.7621,1.0978,7.0541,4.1081,0.022,2.5164,1.0817,5.5629,0.0006,0.7405,1.2089,2.8973,0.7345,3.5596,0.0063,0.2917,3.7922,0.2887,0.3813,0.5266,3.1187,5.3444,0.1296,0.0023,3.5635,0.0403,4.7628,0.4277,0.0112,0.3132,0.812,0.0002,1.4939,1.2752,1.0253,2.7683,0.0003,1.2192,6.4297,0.0149,0.0217,1.4502,2.982,1.263,0.8152,2.3317,0.2354,0.0075,0.9469,0.0402,1.8067,3.8255,1.6359,1.7603,0.9677,1.3065,0.4118,5.2588,1.6819,1.7919,1.2855,5.045,0.1565,0.0489,0.0016,0.1382,0.7774,0.0002,4.372,4.998,3.3306,0.2384,1.3492,0.6789,2.6061,0.0065,0.2282,0.84,0.3279,5.8489,2.4193,0.7392,5.9611,1.5845,3.1646,0.0019,3.129,1.3211,4.1814,3.8973,3.9367,0.4501,2.9395,2.7428,0.0612,0.7225,0.9899,2.4023,5.7617,5.4815,5.9322,0.0049,4.8393,1.5859,0.1789,3.3189,2.3221,0.1751,4.0609,0.3806,0.1825,4.4862,0.7802,0.4527,0.8723,0.0002,4.1599,5.1028,5.3362,2.8387,1.7267,2.7801,0.8096,5.1441,4.1382,0.8485,2.3004,2.9561,4.7613,1.1557,0.3602,0.6737,0.855,2.7618,0.2097,0.9194,4.8372,0.0244,0.0003,0.3707,4.9825,2.3596,1.2076,2.4148,1.0588,2.9394,0.31,3.586,2.1477,0.166,4.1589,0.007,1.6292,3.1926,0.508,0.0002,1.7593,5.3853,0.0366,6.1037,6.2224,0.9985,3.2274,4.2525,0.0865,0.1009,0.3112,0.074,0.0328,1.7429,5.2892,0.822,1.2024,1.1385,4.3574,1.2105,3.229,4.4447,0.0452,0.0009,0.0,0.0001,0.0202,0.4628,0.852,0.0002,1.8984,4.3484,1.4134,3.8684,4.1557,0.3043,0.3684,0.802,0.0876,0.7979,2.4576,0.0022,2.5409,1.3951,0.5348,1.4559,5.4142,0.1127,0.0582,0.0475,0.0432,0.0025,2.0341,0.0384,3.4846,0.0008,1.86,0.7326,2.5438,0.9456,1.3733,5.0818,1.587,3.4847,1.3747,4.4375,4.7927,0.1739,3.492,0.0122,2.4416,4.8806,6.6521,3.944,0.9713,0.0002,1.3633,4.0503,2.7415,3.5964,1.2325,0.2532,3.4605,1.6816,0.3426,3.7901,3.9395,1.0571,5.4114,1.3784,0.0292,0.0332,0.0022,3.1505,0.0246,0.0022,2.5875,1.2996,1.5529,5.4443,1.7783,2.9696,1.3368,5.3039,0.1244,2.1445,5.5884,2.22,1.193,3.23,2.0416,0.0987,0.4857,0.4669,0.0002,4.7836,4.7047,3.6295,3.0685,1.5739,1.5766,1.4223,2.6556,4.1462,0.1127,0.0652,0.1939,0.0174,0.002,0.3992,0.9765,1.2406,5.4688,5.3153,5.2404,0.2409,0.8689,2.4027,2.6449,0.6429,0.0099,0.5301,4.9765,3.7352,0.6827,3.1588,0.0301,0.0032,0.6806,3.292,4.284,0.4338,0.235,0.7196,1.1246,5.3302,3.7428,0.3219,2.8611,0.1726,1.9605,2.8619,2.3922,2.0342,0.1277,0.324,0.9864,0.0478,0.5912,0.1678,0.1647,2.1203,0.8491,0.0874,3.8703,0.2528,2.8456,0.1377,0.0801,2.7449,0.3965,4.6973,1.0637,3.4597,0.6609,3.28,0.3206,1.5807,2.3864,0.0455,2.3762,2.4922,0.5935,0.4291,1.3187,0.0114,5.318,0.1436,0.3384,0.3246,1.6082,0.1129,0.5869,0.3501,0.0002,0.9373,5.3506,0.0033,2.7127,3.5155,0.003,5.5042,1.7931,1.9522,0.0096,0.036,0.0644,2.1277,2.0399,1.4421,4.6985,0.7161,0.5689,3.5643,3.2525,0.7714,1.2159,1.7117,0.3529,0.0003,0.9114,5.095,0.0001,3.7994,3.9126,0.0412,3.0575,0.0524,2.2724,0.1574,1.6853,0.001,0.0017,1.5036,6.5394,1.1351,2.8488,1.1214,4.603,2.8638,3.6494,0.1451,1.5569,2.7619,0.019,0.9684,0.4442,0.0002,0.6185,0.4945,0.0002,1.0225,2.5119,0.0038,0.7746,2.2601,1.5259,2.9569,1.9715,0.8396,0.716,1.7584,3.7267,0.3208,0.6835,0.4065,2.0339,0.0001,0.0001,1.2515,6.1165,2.8515,0.0058,1.9103,0.4795,0.0129,0.0186,0.3609,1.2654,0.0002,5.1607,2.4827,1.0164,4.3911,5.2264,1.0849,6.8598,2.8119,0.4776,3.1304,1.6106,0.418,1.7628,6.3231,1.4289,3.9422,0.0386,1.0962,0.0804,0.0466,1.4491,3.4864,1.2924,2.0064,5.5288,2.6019,1.8071,0.427,3.3087,2.3098,4.7899,1.8638,0.7173,0.4052,0.0365,0.0291,3.7455,3.1047,0.6673,0.0694,3.3104,0.5946,0.0799,4.4985,0.1782,0.177,3.0845,3.4991,1.1004,3.8206,0.5028,2.0513,1.2089,4.954,0.0472,4.9471,1.8242,4.4239,2.8054,3.6195,1.6387,1.2581,0.8438,1.7228,0.6564,1.6136,0.0094,0.0566,5.4428,0.1966,6.4522,3.6432,0.3916,0.3535,4.887,0.4971,0.5054,1.6535,4.5712,2.6724,2.304,0.5697,0.8682,0.0277,0.0149,1.1476,0.7971,0.0002,2.2159,0.0118,0.0014,5.4339,3.1779,1.271,4.6469,3.6215,0.1985,1.9538,3.4264,4.1892,3.8306,2.3831,6.3309,0.7676,0.9334,4.7395,3.6483,0.1374,2.7444,1.1639,1.5001,2.0964,1.6469,1.8112,2.1561,0.0221,4.1027,0.9577,3.8093,0.8009,0.9649,0.0002,2.6035,6.3336,0.2465,2.2165,1.6059,1.8697,2.0728,2.185,1.0148,1.1044,0.0036,0.0181,4.5095,0.0394,0.0025,0.2486,0.3468,0.0548,0.2527,0.0621,0.4185]}

The Danton Class was also planned to have a crew of 6800 in their days of design, but was removed from the ship design after they realized that it was very expensive to maintain.\n\nSee also:","token_len":660,"entropy":[6.9159,8.5319,10.444,7.4152,7.4228,10.1017,11.1556,5.2772,4.6881,3.1374,6.4146,8.3128,6.362,3.9177,5.4239,8.9632,8.3144,0.2942,3.8947,7.4884,3.7316,0.9303,4.5876,2.5112,6.4132,8.2795,0.0847,2.5239,1.657,4.8654,1.5758,6.4012,7.0018,1.3759,2.8675,8.3967,2.8928,0.7849,1.689,0.0797,4.9749,7.3746,6.8077,5.6562,0.0149,0.0075,0.0227,0.0645,8.6337,1.1645,4.3019,3.9677,0.0456,2.7076,2.8016,5.3168,4.312,0.9417,3.2501,0.5904,3.0622,5.5904,1.4243,3.9856,0.0301,0.0955,4.2573,6.5034,2.8615,0.2716,1.6019,0.8196,0.0002,0.9427,1.8632,1.0523,0.9941,6.0075,0.0012,4.8174,1.2622,1.9895,0.0062,4.615,4.707,0.4543,1.3571,5.2393,3.2438,0.176,0.3986,2.2744,3.8695,2.4896,0.6506,1.5009,5.5836,0.9451,0.319,6.9109,1.9695,1.4208,0.2653,0.3524,0.0002,12.3108,3.2122,2.2123,0.0022,0.0033,0.0019,5.8398,0.0072,0.8961,3.3808,1.4946,0.0038,6.0349,2.7607,1.9334,2.9311,3.4734,0.0057,3.6204,2.5138,0.4606,0.0604,2.3273,0.001,2.9038,2.9893,2.6911,5.8668,1.6011,0.2292,4.0187,4.2842,0.1279,0.604,2.7374,4.9216,2.2888,3.4068,4.6719,0.7964,1.0234,5.1686,4.4669,2.6371,0.0043,5.2971,0.0644,4.077,1.0813,5.4984,1.6257,1.1722,6.6959,0.3164,3.6549,0.2598,5.1,2.9778,0.3241,0.7173,0.0002,4.7808,6.0692,3.0428,3.4376,2.5554,1.3024,1.7488,4.9592,3.9647,1.9037,1.1706,4.0735,0.2368,3.2666,1.1378,1.9817,3.7495,3.5914,0.0252,0.9518,2.7259,0.4223,0.2701,3.1117,0.0009,0.1186,3.3134,2.4831,0.7481,2.512,0.1348,3.5349,0.136,0.3829,0.3668,0.0002,4.586,0.0781,0.006,0.0055,0.0008,9.9759,2.4995,1.5069,2.8119,0.9446,1.8038,4.1501,0.4811,0.1182,5.5726,1.4198,0.422,0.0002,4.917,4.168,2.7314,1.876,0.0003,2.1852,0.1073,1.9312,4.0475,5.4102,1.3223,2.9662,3.8162,1.418,0.0002,1.0882,0.0519,0.0013,1.8027,0.098,2.6042,0.0117,1.8594,0.0555,0.1008,0.0002,4.4699,2.4489,0.028,0.205,0.0392,1.9813,0.0073,1.4406,0.0266,0.0887,0.0003,4.6172,5.5739,0.6052,0.0557,2.1311,0.0161,1.1022,0.0703,0.1639,0.0002,3.8998,2.8892,1.908,3.8834,1.264,0.0095,1.2171,0.03,4.1188,5.9324,2.282,5.9317,5.4895,4.164,4.7823,3.4137,2.2492,4.936,2.1049,0.9326,1.3293,2.048,0.5201,0.1122,6.9445,4.2586,0.5984,6.4478,4.1289,3.167,1.7416,4.7044,0.4386,3.9428,2.6566,1.7415,2.1663,5.5082,1.9389,4.6951,4.2558,0.3941,3.8912,0.0778,0.0002,1.6668,0.1017,0.0018,0.0388,0.0083,0.0071,0.0018,0.0006,0.0013,0.1178,0.0155,0.0265,0.0051,0.0012,0.0018,0.0006,0.0163,0.0006,0.0005,0.0746,0.0002,0.0018,0.0264,0.0211,0.0022,0.0241,0.0623,0.0021,0.0066,0.0006,0.0028,0.0062,1.411,3.4886,3.4584,0.3009,0.0011,0.2411,2.5707,1.2041,2.3421,0.2773,3.1663,0.0788,4.8391,2.2439,5.8291,2.8726,3.3513,5.6071,1.1067,2.3117,4.273,3.3453,5.8598,0.0656,3.1106,1.2793,2.3047,3.0107,0.0179,2.3684,5.0491,1.7197,3.8144,1.905,3.8526,2.4038,3.8731,2.9087,0.0148,0.9588,2.4952,3.3798,3.6971,0.0436,3.6241,2.7859,1.4012,1.9308,0.966,3.6053,1.0521,1.4794,0.7858,0.4134,4.518,3.0451,0.0003,1.2422,0.0042,3.4647,0.0051,0.0101,0.0229,0.0122,0.0185,0.0011,0.0023,0.0018,0.0039,0.0009,0.0006,0.0016,0.0006,0.0107,0.0007,0.0008,0.0009,0.0006,0.002,0.0799,0.0004,0.003,0.0047,0.0004,0.0001,0.0047,0.0002,0.0002,0.0002,0.0011,0.0014,0.0008,0.0004,0.0005,0.0002,0.0013,0.0022,0.0004,0.0007,0.0018,0.0026,0.0011,0.0003,0.0003,4.8356,1.6335,0.0256,0.2097,5.2724,2.1412,5.721,4.6702,6.4315,4.2059,2.9789,5.6134,1.6012,2.7745,3.1573,5.1486,6.83,1.8833,3.0167,3.3059,1.3412,1.6447,3.2968,1.9651,2.8339,1.5277,3.2978,3.9244,0.3898,1.6337,0.9549,2.0355,4.5832,3.0076,2.5008,2.185,1.8112,0.3192,0.0003,0.144,0.0034,0.0937,0.0006,0.0005,0.0294,0.0045,0.0152,0.0007,0.003,0.0006,0.022,0.0002,0.0002,0.0002,0.0007,0.0004,0.0012,0.0046,0.0024,0.0008,0.0024,0.0039,0.0109,0.0014,0.0008,0.0011,0.0009,0.0488,0.0001,0.0007,11.625,1.6901,0.215,1.7105,0.0244,0.0256,0.0082,0.009,0.1344,0.0012,0.0277,0.2116,0.0012,0.3176,1.1285,0.0001,0.1239,3.7266,6.3512,5.0795,0.6216,0.0391,0.9105,1.6939,2.1424,4.8374,1.0349,1.7927,2.2133,4.2253,1.3914,4.4506,2.2751,3.9785,1.8986,0.5489,0.5602,2.301,1.2702,5.5219,5.1455,3.4148,2.1779,2.2513,1.3532,1.2616,0.1341,0.7542,5.8622,2.2879,5.3158,1.2898,1.4774,2.2231,1.1114,2.0888,5.3355,0.1748,3.351,4.3179,3.9357,0.0494,5.5439,3.3841,0.5885,0.6079,0.0002,2.2318,5.9827,3.5594,2.2739,0.0128,2.1684,0.298,3.479,2.524,0.8836,3.6316,1.0709,3.0062,0.0795,4.167,5.1359,1.4167,1.7736,2.8059,1.3163,5.4985,0.1413,1.8888,2.1642,0.0152,4.227,4.1268,2.8151,2.8201,0.3739,0.6451,1.9432,2.7714,0.2099,1.5864,2.0004,2.9557,4.1363,0.1737,0.3663,0.4746,0.3957,0.0396,0.9519,4.7685,4.9938,4.1047,6.0625,1.1302,2.943,0.3568,0.1706,2.1956,4.3515,1.4635,0.3696,3.4616,2.0436,3.1216,3.825,2.5485,0.8735,1.9909,1.1328,4.504,1.0027,0.6782,1.135,1.3822,0.6283,0.0002,4.9465,0.768,1.164]}
{"id":1191,"ended":false,"length":561,"gen_text":"Hornung was born Ernest William Hornung on 7 June 1866 at Cleveland Villas, Marton, Middlesbrough ; he was nicknamed Willie from an early age. He was the third son, and youngest son 'of Edward Charles Hornung Jr (b. 1851) of Balfour House in Leicestershire and his marriage to Fanny Boaden-Hornung (b 12 May 1855) on 16 October 1867 at Marton. Fanny was the eldest child and the daughter of Edward P. Hornung and his wife Mary Emma (n\u00e9e Blount) of Marton.\n\nHe was educated at West Park School and then at St John's School. From the age of 19 he moved on to St John's University Cambridge. In 1871 he joined the Royal Engineers and graduated with the Honour of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 1875.\n\nHe remained in the Royal Engineers after leaving St John's University. He fought and led many skirmishes with Indians, and was wounded in 1885 and again in 1887. He made some of the most famous campaigns of the Indian Mutiny, and in this position he commanded the first British Army from Sirhind to the Wani River.\n\nAfter leaving the Royal Engineers he moved to New South Wales where he served as First Sergeant in the NSW Regiment which was then on leave. In January 1889 he moved again, this time to Victoria with Lieutenant Colonel Fitzwilliam Tuckett, the officer who would command the 3rd Brigade of the British Army, when that Brigade entered Brisbane in August 1891. Tuckett was the same General who had led the army in Britain when the British landed in France in 1917, and as a general he had had a good influence on their campaigns in this part of the world at the beginning of the 20 th Century.\n\nDuring his time as a Lieutenant Colonel with the 3rd Brigade Tuckett managed to win numerous engagements against the Aborigines (during this period he was also serving in India where he had also commanded an expeditionary force) and he won medals during this time. He left Victoria in 1896; at this time he was elected a Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute.\n\nHornung was soon posted to the 7th Battalion of the Australian Army, and was promoted to Captain in 1899. Hornung had one further engagement with the Aborigines and was wounded. He remained in the Australian Army until 1915.\n\nAfter World War One the Australia War Memorial honoured Tuckett and Hornung, showing their \"most conspicuous bravery\".\n\nHe retired from the Australian Army in September 1918.\n\nHe married Alice Frances MacLaren and moved to Melbourne with her. Their son was born in Victoria on 8 December 1919.

{"id":3853,"ended":true,"length":620,"gen_text":"Unbeknownst to the Japanese however, Chiang had already ordered Tang to abandon the defense. In spite of his earlier talk about holding out in Nanking to the bitter end, Chiang telegraphed an officer in command of the Chinese naval fleet to say that if the Japanese fleet attacked, he would surrender Nanking. Chiang did not wait until the orders were actually signed to start the evacuation.\n\nThis wasn't done quickly, and it didn't happen quickly enough for the Japanese to lose and thus the war.\n\nIt is a very good story and quite true, although the Japanese did actually start to lose the island by June 1st. The Japanese knew the end was near but were determined to fight to the bitter end. They had only 500 troops to defend Nanking with 4,000 stationed in an area that included the city. The Japanese knew the battle was over and they wanted to stay and fight until the last Japanese soldier died. In a rare moment during the fighting, one Japanese officer actually surrendered. He left his ship and returned to a river and the Japanese surrender was recorded, so some of the casualties were counted.\n\nAfter the fighting was over and the remaining Japanese on Nanking left for home, a Japanese military official told journalists,\n\nWe had been promised to remain in Nanking, where the Emperor might give us orders to move further, which we were willing to do.\n\nThe Japanese commanders had already had their orders, \"We are not leaving Nanking.\" That's what we were promised but we had already got the word.\" They could have evacuated as they had promised.\n\n(Source: Stephen Ambrose, ed. War By Another Name: The Japanese Army During the Second World War, p. 181)\n\nSo what really happened during the Japanese siege of Nanking?\n\nAs the war dragged on, the Japanese increased their attacks on Chinese civilians as a way to distract the Chinese government. They even set fire to a few of them on purpose, because they knew that Chinese people don't like being burned alive and they also knew that Chinese children are very cute.\n\nThe final phase of the invasion did have something to do with surrendering. A few days after they finally got the word that the island had been taken by occupation forces, President Truman decided to withdraw the last of the soldiers. He was convinced that his decision to stay in China would help the final victory for Japan and the world. He feared the Japanese might move to conquer Taiwan to gain support in resisting Communist China. Even today, the Chinese government is not quite sure about this. They also don't think that this was the actual reason that the Japanese surrendered.\n\nThe Japanese were on Nanking when Nanking was taken, but didn't surrender until after the Chinese government had taken over. As for why the Japanese surrendered when they did, that's a complex issue involving both the timing of their surrender and internal political issues including the reasons of the war. Most historians take a middle route that states that Japanese troops gave in to Chinese control of Nanking in the midst of a campaign to win over China. That would be consistent with the theory behind the Chinese Communists and Communists' defeat of the Japanese at the Battle of Beijing in 1937.","token_len":662,"entropy":[7.2001,0.0043,0.0684,0.0121,1.72,6.4664,7.5272,0.0735,7.1652,5.2595,1.8757,2.5361,3.9461,9.161,0.9194,4.3933,0.6971,5.8454,3.0579,3.2592,4.4701,0.0159,2.2578,3.4968,7.315,1.8727,5.6064,2.1105,3.5826,7.136,0.0665,4.3385,2.3473,2.5847,0.0025,0.0698,2.0499,0.0006,10.3464,0.0061,0.0002,0.0002,4.7872,5.9092,1.2758,5.0276,0.1822,0.5518,2.3462,4.5057,2.0924,1.2392,3.5057,0.4763,2.8186,0.9164,0.4945,4.5256,2.5322,1.3127,1.33,0.3273,3.123,3.0996,0.0011,1.1248,3.7311,0.0006,3.6303,0.4368,4.0327,3.4641,0.4395,6.0953,1.2414,2.6735,4.8935,2.7616,4.6237,0.9561,1.3607,0.5962,1.3726,0.0194,4.8846,5.6655,0.0006,5.8405,4.7637,1.9419,2.2528,2.2758,2.7734,0.0003,0.926,2.8115,0.0843,2.037,0.6044,0.3817,0.8674,5.1183,6.4484,4.8234,3.277,2.4225,0.494,2.5261,0.0001,4.056,1.8834,3.0265,4.1999,2.5608,2.2838,2.5051,4.7784,4.4469,1.4157,3.1742,1.7419,1.5014,1.7746,4.5391,4.4005,1.597,1.3856,1.6176,5.8759,2.9592,4.4757,3.1423,1.1158,0.8732,1.931,1.2632,4.9517,2.3586,4.5984,0.1424,0.6505,3.6133,2.7536,3.2151,0.2514,2.7207,1.4757,0.02,1.7424,0.0111,0.5556,2.3542,2.0876,4.3322,5.5566,2.8559,3.1212,0.5724,1.2364,0.0023,3.2688,4.9255,0.399,0.2238,5.3741,1.3457,4.4399,2.2687,1.9454,3.4611,0.7159,1.6914,1.4245,1.6857,0.6891,3.0894,1.7866,3.4578,0.8944,2.0226,1.8801,2.2044,3.1608,0.2344,4.632,1.9126,0.3193,2.9695,0.5261,1.2748,2.4259,0.6511,2.2689,0.2936,3.988,3.2476,4.2303,1.765,6.8292,0.2302,2.992,0.4168,3.263,0.6537,1.585,3.1317,3.0038,1.9617,2.2826,5.7869,1.2244,4.2752,0.9575,5.6866,0.0948,4.0326,5.826,3.4199,4.0343,1.0859,2.9821,1.9156,3.9552,4.029,5.5888,5.718,2.1076,0.2136,5.4226,1.0305,3.5053,0.9,0.9217,0.0002,4.1086,0.9459,3.7551,1.3006,0.1426,2.4438,0.3878,5.6341,0.3883,5.3814,0.9936,0.0027,4.0306,2.1899,1.4849,0.1539,3.2987,2.305,4.2417,2.2212,3.7418,5.579,2.685,2.926,0.0002,3.0288,2.7307,3.0199,5.0615,2.5535,4.5284,1.6536,0.4119,0.0017,2.042,4.8857,2.2939,1.7111,6.1543,4.3347,0.2605,4.1619,2.1036,4.9766,5.0189,3.7987,5.7561,0.5561,2.2304,2.6484,0.0313,1.0819,0.7021,1.7551,0.0001,1.6407,0.6762,5.7026,2.4232,3.5994,5.1233,1.738,0.7623,2.6963,5.4543,2.6526,1.574,2.7793,1.7483,1.5869,0.0014,1.3162,4.7833,2.1392,1.724,2.8232,1.0953,2.7638,5.512,1.0304,2.5939,1.7961,5.3301,1.925,3.7611,5.0352,4.6437,4.6515,0.7606,5.0732,3.9488,2.0048,1.4862,2.4599,2.0056,1.0871,0.0001,4.9556,2.4309,0.3417,6.1384,3.3936,0.5832,5.4406,1.9394,5.2994,6.0105,0.895,0.007,0.4765,0.7354,2.7938,3.1855,4.3041,1.588,0.7273,0.2579,0.0018,1.4379,3.055,0.149,5.9407,0.6722,0.2297,0.0002,3.4911,2.7343,2.8319,0.0484,3.2888,0.185,2.6913,2.9247,0.3951,0.0113,0.0006,0.1748,0.8448,0.0001,3.9964,1.5925,3.556,2.653,0.0456,0.4408,0.7446,0.3853,5.7428,0.6483,1.6466,0.4876,2.5612,0.9676,4.0304,2.3982,0.9252,0.6521,3.4789,0.926,0.5417,3.5258,1.9263,2.1203,3.5518,3.93,0.5963,0.0104,1.5337,4.8955,2.9201,2.7118,3.8859,4.5536,1.9614,4.7225,0.5343,1.8163,1.1661,2.7449,2.479,5.8843,0.0006,1.6916,2.3235,0.3217,0.5974,3.143,1.8403,3.7892,0.6885,0.2918,1.9364,4.9399,3.2326,2.4639,5.4275,0.9309,0.9215,0.0002,1.6064,5.4408,4.5835,0.0883,0.0755,5.2801,5.3689,4.5541,4.7608,0.3339,0.0173,0.0054,3.3835,1.8228,1.6184,4.678,2.5078,0.8304,0.8703,3.6806,4.1899,2.7399,1.2147,0.9237,0.6567,0.5628,5.3803,1.9205,0.4664,1.6125,2.7304,7.6525,0.4894,0.1645,5.8364,1.5833,3.6193,0.5176,4.6485,1.2043,2.3765,0.9599,0.3888,6.1477,2.0428,2.1896,2.8459,3.8655,0.33,4.9799,1.989,1.9551,3.648,0.8966,2.3307,1.2774,2.4713,1.867,5.8158,2.8507,4.9395,1.7222,2.49,1.9243,3.5162,0.4946,2.2912,5.1217,2.1598,1.3929,1.694,5.3688,1.7766,4.3441,1.7567,5.1814,3.0084,3.6587,2.8449,6.0676,4.0949,0.548,0.2815,5.9094,4.8476,0.3909,1.6638,2.1996,0.7002,2.2356,3.2269,4.0161,0.2767,3.0388,2.1009,1.5099,2.6706,4.0082,1.8081,0.0003,2.8791,0.9142,4.8549,1.2144,0.7998,3.9669,0.6177,2.0474,0.7364,0.2413,0.6299,0.4822,0.7452,0.0002,1.8464,0.7092,2.785,5.3437,2.3512,0.002,3.8962,6.8839,0.0039,0.3857,1.3329,1.5589,1.0548,5.3507,0.0002,1.2803,0.8716,1.7263,0.8128,3.2182,1.0182,1.1668,3.864,0.9248,1.0429,4.3346,3.3839,2.0904,0.8904,0.1206,1.4586,3.6838,0.2626,0.2472,0.1055,2.9862,1.23,0.9118,4.7846,2.2814,4.5017,3.4883,1.5778,5.2056,0.8359,1.9305,0.51,0.3424,6.8822,2.2323,1.5109,7.7756,0.8901,5.7303,3.8978,1.3109,2.852,0.9135,5.3229,0.8512,6.1298,1.6493,2.0189,4.0019,3.1268,5.5285,0.4126,4.0821,2.3398,5.0806,2.7218,0.8819,1.7323,5.422,2.7633,1.117,0.0004,2.7447,1.6617,4.0216,0.0028,1.4493,4.6327,1.0217,3.8532,2.1118,4.2143,1.5967,3.9325,2.8331,2.3864,2.2373,0.023,0.7071,5.4663,6.1835,0.5047,3.8115,5.3405,2.7605,4.4445,3.8566,4.3215,1.1948,0.467,0.0977,2.8962,0.3588,1.6153,0.0086,2.9563,0.7541,0.3604,0.4035]}
{"id":1059,"ended":false,"length":567,"gen_text":"Wi\u015bniowiecki's courtier and first biographer, Micha\u0142 < unk >, counted that Jeremi participated in nine wars in his lifetime. The first of those was the Smolensk Campaign of 1633 \u2013 34, where he served in the Polish army under Czes\u0142aw Poniatowski, his brother in arms with Rurik K\u0119dziorski, king of Riga, and a supporter of the Protestant movement. Jeremi was forced to become a soldier of the Holy League and died fighting the Ottoman Turks.\nHe also fought on the Dutch and Spanish fronts, at the siege of Vienna, and in the siege of Saragossa. He continued his career as a soldier up to the 18th century, when he was sent to serve in the French army with the aid of Baron Auguste de Miette, later on becoming a minister in Louis XVIII's cabinet.\nJerozolwi\u015bniowiecki was married twelve times, some of them to important Christian rulers. He left his surname to several of his descendants and has five sons who have been made princes of the Polish crown.\nWhile he may have had a good relationship with the Protestant kings, there was not as much tolerance for the Catholic Polish kings. Jeremi served under Walachia as a captain in the Polish armies, but even after the death of Walachia's last king, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Jeremi continued to fight against the Polish nobility, and even after his accession to the Polish throne, he remained a staunch defender of Polish interests at the Court of Vienna. That was a betrayal of his duty as a soldier.\nIt is clear that in his later years he did not get along with his brother \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. That is, however, nothing new in his time at the court; the brother and their fathers had a bitter rivalry. I have never liked \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The young \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had always been a soldier first, poet second, philosopher third. His contemporaries at the court never even seemed to notice that he was an artistic genius. However, I did admire him; he was a visionary. A few years after his father's death, when the elder \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had become increasingly infirm and senile, he asked his younger brother to put his brother's books in one of the old man's bookshelves, where he would look at them. On that occasion I remember I thought he looked kind of sad, like he was taking a loss with his books. Nowadays I would say he looked kind of sad because he was losing the ability to play the piano and keep his intellectual mind active, and so was more or less deadened for a time.\nI really do not know why all of these things brought me to the topic of the death of Jeremi \u0141\u00f3dzii, which I also never enjoyed reading about. However, there is the possibility that it was because of my lack of interest in the topic, but I did the best by trying to write a fair, but also an in-depth look at the life and time of this extraordinary character.

{"id":623,"ended":false,"length":569,"gen_text":"Since 1993, the proportion of lbws in each English season has risen steadily. According to cricket historian Douglas Miller, the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball @ - @ and 'ball' in their rules. The ball @ - @ method of dismissal was popular because it was consistent with the belief that the batsman was to be 'on the move' while he stood at the crease. In the early years, these dismissals were called'spin dismissals' and the 'bowler' was supposed to be trying to control where he wanted the ball to go. The method became the new ball-tracking measure. The first rule from the Cricket Board of India states that if the ball is moved on between the batsmen, \"in any part of the batting, or in his own or the field of play\" the batsman is out. In a bowling duel with the bowler, this was used to describe a batsman who had'spun' the ball off the bowler. It was never an attempt at controlling the flight of the ball \u2013 the purpose was to keep the ball away from the batsman, or at least make it difficult for the batsman to pull the ball.\n\nAnother measure based on the notion of spin was devised by England's captain Edward Windle in the latter part of the 19th century, which was the first to use the now outdated system of 'one bat speed' to describe batsmanship. The first 'cricket' game to use this method was at Lord's in 1886. It remains that the game's biggest stars of the era such as Viv Richards, Ian Botham, and Kevin Pietersen were all known to have used the ball @ - @ as a trademark term. During Windle's heyday in the early part of the 20th century, a batsman could have'spun' the ball as often as he wished, according to Miller. All that changed when West Indies' star batsman, Jimmy Adams was found guilty of'spinning' a ball and fined 50 per cent of his match fees, a penalty that made spin bowling nearly extinct in the English game; at present it is estimated that only one or two bowlers per season use the ball @ - @. This is not to say that there were not moments of frustration and excitement during my years of playing. But the fact is, the old-time way of keeping the ball away from players has now been overtaken by spin bowling and the ball now comes over the wicket with such accuracy that it is quite difficult to'spin' it even if it is not in the air.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this fascinating and colourful side of cricket, I recommend reading our book, One Handedness: A Tale of Sport, Sport and Human Nature by Matthew Evans (HarperCollins UK, 2008).\n\n\nBibliography\n\nMiller, Douglas, 'Cleaning-up a game', BBC Sport, 7 July, 2009 -

{"id":4009,"ended":false,"length":643,"gen_text":"Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, electric potentials play an important role. The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how much'space' that is, is zero.\nIt goes without saying that if you want to have a zero potential for a plasma, you have to have a gas that's really, really heavy. When you have a gas with such a low potential, it cannot ionize its surroundings and lose electrons. This means that the temperature, and thus the amount of ionization you get from the plasma, has to increase in order to provide the conditions we're after. In other words:\nthe potential of the plasma has to increase. As for the way to increase the potential with a plasma, here's a pretty good one : you add some gas with a large ionization current. I'll talk about this in more detail when we get to plasma dynamics.\nWhat really goes on is that the temperature rises, which means that, as there's more electricity flowing inside the plasma, the net magnetic field has to rise as well. Since the plasma doesn't allow for any charge loss in this process, there's not as much net electricity flowing inside the plasma as you'd expect from your (bad) textbooks. But, because the electric field is higher than the magnetic field, which is the way it has to start off, it is, therefore, 'wetting out' the magnetic field and increasing the magnetostatic strength. This is what gives rise to the observed dip, and that's as clear as day:\nNote that even if the density of the plasma is very high, because of the higher net electric field, the density, and consequently the magnetic field, is still on the decline, meaning that this pressure is still increasing at the plasma boundaries, which is where the true flow begins. I don't have enough space here to go into the details of how this happens, so let's just say that there will be a net electrical current flowing at the plasma boundary.\nI could show you that the net magnetic activity will rise as the magnetic field rises, but that's not necessary, not even if you try to.\u00a0 What I mean is that, at the same time that the magnetic field increases, the net electric field also increases, and if you can put a magnetic field scale on one side of the plasma, for example, you can just as well measure the net electric field on the plasma and see if this is the same as the net magnetic field.\nThese two, and probably many, of the laws that people study in plasma theory, can all be used to produce a picture of what's going on when a plasma has more electrical charge (say, electrons ) than magnetic field (say, the plasma is charged and the magnetic field is not), and there's much more to it than that.\nAt the end of the day, this is not much of a 'proposals' that we can use in a paper, but it's definitely interesting in the sense of helping us to understand a little bit more about plasma dynamics and also about magnetostatic force and electric field. There could be a good deal more to say about this subject, but here's to the next post!","token_len":667,"entropy":[11.1332,3.7569,0.2997,1.1634,3.9516,3.0509,6.3187,1.0353,0.0035,0.3287,6.8229,6.0363,0.9382,6.8679,1.3585,0.209,0.0606,3.047,2.0954,3.6346,7.5548,2.9469,2.3825,2.7916,7.5628,1.7484,0.99,4.4521,0.947,5.8295,0.4349,3.1173,8.2047,0.0282,0.7817,10.0615,0.706,3.5009,1.9424,9.4333,13.7982,9.2153,3.9811,2.1757,0.7343,0.6668,2.7442,0.3688,2.4615,8.8973,5.6064,0.5988,0.0047,0.1314,2.4145,1.4934,2.7841,0.2554,3.3867,0.7476,4.7855,1.2203,3.5189,1.3619,1.7891,0.2964,0.4356,1.3701,0.0281,1.7751,0.884,5.9344,1.5677,1.435,4.6742,1.6077,0.028,4.6155,0.4726,4.9776,0.8228,2.0667,0.5393,1.7247,2.4996,3.3851,0.4641,1.3803,1.3115,0.2697,1.4014,5.1151,4.5516,0.1309,3.8378,1.0396,2.5624,5.5328,1.3546,0.9885,3.162,1.7659,0.2462,1.2922,4.9026,3.748,2.1328,1.854,0.1656,3.038,0.0142,3.2887,0.2934,4.471,0.6985,2.0301,0.9793,0.4555,0.3809,3.0555,0.1469,5.1125,3.0387,0.587,0.3356,5.3108,1.2182,4.4625,7.0096,2.3469,2.2362,0.2173,3.3483,2.1417,0.0024,3.5654,3.0261,4.6875,4.338,1.7922,0.8113,0.2276,1.0735,0.0127,0.5343,2.106,5.1193,4.3574,0.6354,4.6099,1.053,1.3029,0.6107,0.3163,6.9137,1.6468,1.3258,0.2037,4.3829,0.5041,1.0036,4.182,0.852,2.4252,4.0406,2.3011,3.2074,2.9297,3.0863,3.2495,0.6603,4.1082,2.045,0.4457,5.1794,1.5805,4.2582,3.3467,2.4649,0.4515,0.8544,1.0836,1.4478,0.1488,3.9245,0.564,0.9614,0.165,3.5318,3.0458,0.4662,0.4955,3.8144,5.8861,5.499,0.4114,2.7083,0.6091,0.9275,4.062,3.9621,1.6448,2.6388,1.4714,0.3401,4.724,1.8018,5.6372,0.5627,0.866,5.081,1.423,4.437,0.4373,0.4432,0.0675,0.6018,6.2245,4.2138,0.4023,2.8205,0.0712,3.5596,1.957,0.0071,0.2638,4.3166,0.7197,2.1097,4.1243,0.0006,5.2182,3.0048,2.0745,3.4851,3.8994,3.6689,2.3393,0.9512,0.1019,3.1499,0.5208,3.2029,5.0959,0.0757,2.1657,5.9386,0.6392,1.9189,0.6854,0.0951,0.517,1.9141,0.9007,0.4727,2.0838,4.1005,5.6358,4.2886,0.2346,5.4138,0.311,2.7672,2.399,3.2136,0.7037,2.6465,0.5871,0.8573,2.7053,1.5769,0.2037,0.3409,0.0609,0.1298,6.6137,0.9338,2.1338,3.7999,1.1914,2.9798,0.0251,8.472,3.1487,0.6696,2.0163,4.1507,3.4319,4.7406,0.024,6.1398,4.4837,4.2882,0.6401,0.05,0.6566,2.4951,0.2525,2.7433,3.164,0.2829,4.9329,3.2023,0.2624,3.6445,0.8635,1.7106,1.1489,2.1755,3.472,1.501,0.0093,0.4782,4.2017,5.5665,5.407,1.6663,3.6476,0.3229,6.5638,6.2562,0.6899,1.4946,2.5668,0.7834,4.8186,0.4706,4.96,1.9678,1.0468,5.2924,0.4141,0.369,0.6122,0.7866,2.2713,1.6256,0.3817,3.2803,0.8642,0.2785,5.0581,2.4705,1.1225,0.4987,0.4401,0.697,3.1458,5.2841,1.5258,3.6653,0.1888,1.5829,0.2599,0.2784,0.8685,1.2119,6.0527,0.297,6.4578,1.9958,3.5587,0.2244,4.353,5.9384,1.8201,1.9497,3.4401,3.4077,0.8142,2.529,4.952,1.9947,2.0427,0.9916,4.3436,0.7575,6.0275,5.816,3.0864,0.3034,5.0926,2.9733,0.0006,2.0537,3.3432,2.3678,1.3914,0.0914,1.28,0.1262,0.9875,0.8679,0.3905,1.6701,0.9125,1.6609,0.4135,2.2982,2.8112,0.3949,0.7535,0.9792,0.2605,3.2672,5.6309,0.3231,0.9226,2.4723,4.0409,1.0541,1.2135,2.3824,0.2739,0.6411,1.6352,1.4468,0.8981,3.9746,4.2456,3.9426,0.2112,2.7929,1.304,2.552,1.2919,8.2975,3.2526,3.1631,2.0094,1.4074,2.2362,0.1556,1.7232,0.4409,0.6153,1.2906,0.8333,1.1708,3.6184,1.6548,6.3791,3.329,1.5571,0.6791,4.5625,0.7228,2.6327,5.1793,3.8234,1.8025,3.2773,0.5659,0.1835,1.7981,3.6175,0.8194,2.7921,0.2172,0.9361,0.2487,0.935,0.1535,3.3411,0.1536,0.3956,1.2992,1.2502,0.8132,1.5379,0.3055,0.8692,1.3355,3.7553,0.678,4.1682,4.8861,1.9964,2.6937,0.1759,6.5435,0.541,4.6615,1.3264,0.3578,0.4816,1.1263,0.4032,6.1339,0.5273,0.4194,1.5634,1.2752,4.6913,1.254,1.0127,2.7666,0.286,1.0851,0.7564,0.1982,1.2551,0.0723,6.0741,3.9086,1.822,2.4246,3.516,1.0931,1.2705,0.2292,1.0154,0.2104,2.151,0.0242,0.0366,0.562,1.7069,6.0587,1.4,5.3278,2.622,4.6513,1.4573,2.6899,2.4451,0.5795,4.9764,1.5739,6.7428,4.2337,1.3905,0.3725,3.6439,2.365,2.5304,3.0115,0.0428,4.2247,0.2592,5.0272,1.7343,3.0551,0.3299,1.3084,0.7293,0.6592,0.0081,3.8484,1.5136,0.4601,3.1771,5.515,3.5315,1.6365,4.0728,4.4887,0.3098,4.3446,5.5008,0.1925,1.5863,1.065,0.5258,0.1782,0.0237,1.6747,2.0991,1.8196,3.7742,3.3159,1.0017,0.607,0.0458,0.1205,2.0863,3.1718,0.9718,4.5423,0.7518,5.5591,0.7344,0.8506,1.1158,0.2177,0.8498,0.3762,1.7416,5.0556,1.3068,0.7857,0.1473,0.5411,0.2376,0.0768,3.0276,0.7028,3.0187,5.0845,0.8914,0.1762,4.2543,4.192,4.5973,3.9204,0.2209,4.8533,2.6936,1.751,2.1928,2.2062,3.1144,4.6156,0.9768,0.9727,0.809,0.9305,4.7398,2.8679,4.4975,1.6428,1.0544,2.3298,4.4629,0.6425,0.9666,0.56,3.0274,1.5135,0.5791,0.4657,0.2688,1.7918,1.7932,1.8013,4.5155,2.7265,4.2807,0.2385,0.6001,2.756,2.3568,3.3134,0.9256,1.132,5.1692,5.8617,0.3006,1.6119,4.4664,3.5329,0.7872,0.6703,2.4665,0.4661,1.2429,2.3601,0.3164,0.4626,6.0708,0.7829,4.3885,2.2407,1.6321,1.6923,0.7748]}
{"id":1075,"ended":true,"length":633,"gen_text":"`` The Secret `` was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. The episode was written in roughly 26 hours and was the fastest episode written for the series, at the time. \" -- Joss Whedon in the July 22, 2006 interview with The Telegraph\n\nThe pilot episode of The Avengers has been officially named \"Spirited Away\" and the story was written by a combination of director Aniplex, staff writer Joss Whedon and Joss Whedon. During the live action portion of the movie, the three writers each had 10 pages where they could work on dialogue, ideas for scenes and the scene itself, or just sit around and have fun (there was one particular scene that Joss Whedon had never written but had it written by himself.)\n\nThe movie also features a new ending for one of the characters. The writer Joss Whedon said during the press conference that they decided to change the ending because it was boring and did not change any major pieces of the franchise history.\n\nIn an interview with IGN, Joss Whedon also states that after working on the show for 20 days, he only had time to write 2 or 3 things.\n\nJoss Whedon on the Pilot:\n\nIt took about 26 hours. Each episode takes a lot longer than that. I wrote a whole new beginning to one of the characters, who I also wrote two different endings for. So there were two separate episodes that had been written, which was the fastest I'd ever had to do anything on a TV series. [We got two days to script. The pilot is about 10 hours long -- that's just an outline. By episode two, it's 50-60 pages of very complete dialogue.]\n\nWe went through a very rough script, and you're so in the moment. I feel very lucky at my age that I found the movie business to be incredibly easy. I didn't think I was capable of being successful in that business. I just felt that the way I wrote shows was not going to work for movies. It was just too big and too complicated. I was really pleased with the pilot that we did. I think it was a big, big success. We had to write two endings, the big ending and the very rough ending. We did two versions of that [-- as you can hear, both are in the movie]. When you do a TV movie, the final film must be a TV movie. We had the rough ending, and the final ending had to be both -- the rough version had to be a little rough with stuff, and then the final ending had to be a completely finished film. I think the rough version is the better one. The rough version would really be a rough draft, to me. But I wanted my draft to be very complete. I wasn't just writing a rough draft for a pilot; I wanted them to both be final versions, which they ultimately were. A rough draft is more for a TV show; a final version is more for a movie. It's like when you're writing in the novel, you need to have a final draft. \" -- Joss Whedon in the July 22, 2006 interview with The Telegraph (link)\n\nAvengers: The Movie is set for release in April 2012.","token_len":667,"entropy":[6.2642,9.8243,8.4772,7.8125,4.0413,0.7417,6.6865,6.3055,0.0789,1.3721,5.5288,3.7356,0.14,0.0568,0.0035,0.0202,1.0978,2.0225,6.2893,1.2779,0.5929,6.2819,7.4203,6.7887,1.4735,2.1413,1.9213,2.726,5.5777,1.9726,3.6868,1.1572,0.897,0.5966,2.5886,2.9615,3.3075,0.0927,0.4654,4.5995,2.414,4.7351,0.4015,0.0211,4.3456,2.1016,4.5019,4.6334,0.1515,2.9559,3.3278,0.8314,2.6556,4.9627,2.1214,0.0296,2.222,5.4356,1.0779,0.9502,2.4159,1.7251,4.3715,0.979,4.4125,2.7575,0.7529,3.7012,4.0181,1.3026,0.0052,1.1539,1.7242,2.5044,3.9659,2.0145,0.7909,0.1592,5.0894,3.4439,0.0062,4.6689,6.1636,2.5379,0.0001,2.207,4.9152,0.4632,2.6582,0.0586,0.0079,1.0432,4.0643,0.7521,0.4699,2.0904,6.247,0.3897,6.0161,2.8796,2.148,0.0989,0.1856,4.4393,0.3341,1.2705,4.8469,1.2165,4.9206,2.3411,5.5604,2.8053,6.1573,0.078,1.7806,2.5012,0.9909,5.5172,1.845,2.9018,2.6154,1.8939,0.8914,3.0637,5.4651,2.2548,2.1362,3.3493,3.0606,3.9125,1.7785,0.4529,2.6069,0.7567,4.9008,5.2778,1.214,3.2241,4.6614,0.8876,1.5128,2.2678,0.0038,0.8009,2.0979,5.0883,1.9161,4.4446,2.7135,4.7908,1.6268,1.5696,3.5325,4.5972,1.2875,0.0002,1.3552,4.3435,3.639,1.2893,1.6998,4.3612,5.2719,2.6665,4.044,0.1221,0.0646,1.8217,1.7067,1.9185,5.2786,3.9323,0.0268,0.0317,2.7713,3.7921,0.4595,2.9194,0.4571,0.8351,3.3012,2.8964,0.3639,1.9634,0.3576,0.3912,1.5919,2.2003,0.8968,5.7825,1.3256,3.6998,0.0222,5.6448,4.0532,3.265,5.9233,0.058,0.327,7.3308,6.2137,0.3472,1.0731,0.0002,3.2755,2.822,0.2303,0.3702,2.3897,0.3238,0.7224,0.0027,0.0483,3.6653,5.6199,0.2114,4.9962,4.6392,0.1917,0.565,3.6895,0.5578,5.9925,4.2268,0.4886,0.9303,4.2927,1.0937,3.6147,0.2884,0.4942,3.4744,2.7981,0.0185,5.7891,1.6315,1.3096,0.0002,2.6385,0.0066,0.046,4.3768,1.0742,3.6128,2.1331,0.4249,0.0002,4.412,3.5804,2.2615,2.0711,0.0698,2.431,5.6541,2.7126,3.0696,2.4019,2.2779,0.5858,1.1705,0.1045,0.6092,1.8836,2.4999,2.2297,3.0541,3.7583,4.6657,1.6262,2.4822,0.2741,0.1574,0.4239,1.172,3.5951,2.2584,5.0827,0.9502,5.0807,3.9552,0.2922,0.4118,0.445,3.1105,3.072,1.06,2.227,3.0874,3.0766,1.8191,3.0899,4.1369,0.3596,1.7046,2.9222,1.308,3.1091,2.0433,1.7621,1.5447,0.2117,4.7416,0.2411,1.5577,1.4212,1.7888,1.4029,1.245,1.7515,0.3386,4.0598,5.0931,4.6815,4.9746,2.5646,1.1717,5.4316,4.0143,2.7616,3.256,2.0381,3.306,3.0853,3.0108,0.5118,5.1982,4.9342,0.2852,4.26,3.5719,3.9068,1.755,4.7654,2.8867,2.2313,0.405,2.1048,0.9483,4.5294,2.1728,0.4775,0.8439,1.9047,5.64,5.2785,2.6593,1.5714,1.0991,0.0002,5.4914,3.8901,2.0081,1.507,3.517,3.9964,2.5228,1.5111,0.9464,5.8779,2.8909,5.5717,3.3223,0.4453,0.5318,2.1802,2.5792,4.9017,3.2688,0.8798,6.3561,5.9124,0.5783,1.5604,0.2747,6.9039,2.3909,5.9471,3.1552,3.1681,0.0931,5.5969,3.2984,0.9269,1.2474,3.2026,0.0003,3.7191,1.4926,1.7585,2.8466,0.0918,3.5058,3.7905,1.5541,2.2638,1.124,0.9687,1.087,3.1322,3.1171,2.1613,2.5091,3.4324,0.8,2.6013,4.4575,0.9886,2.2287,2.7816,0.0088,1.2339,1.5291,1.6096,0.2903,2.6719,1.269,2.1421,1.802,4.7368,1.9651,1.0936,2.1788,0.5978,1.516,2.321,3.3519,5.2816,0.6199,0.6852,2.6086,3.0122,0.4716,0.8986,0.629,1.3054,1.6501,0.6306,1.6951,1.3716,4.3697,3.6939,1.5138,1.5878,0.4096,3.1395,1.9883,3.0141,4.7194,3.275,2.4852,1.5304,4.3428,5.0982,2.1298,0.5548,0.5201,3.4055,5.4852,0.3541,0.7394,2.1561,3.0628,3.13,1.8317,0.2649,1.6375,5.4907,5.7286,5.9538,3.1061,0.7762,3.661,1.7397,3.7692,2.0784,3.4473,0.2143,0.9822,1.1568,5.0239,1.787,2.7115,0.9033,2.7079,3.2437,0.1575,2.8134,5.1929,4.3474,5.5138,0.5928,2.1257,4.8526,0.116,0.5389,2.4263,0.9942,4.1222,0.4297,0.8998,1.1408,0.9328,2.1816,1.2981,2.1165,2.8143,0.3957,0.2208,5.8429,5.1295,1.8784,0.1833,3.034,3.8174,0.1547,0.2575,1.564,5.1634,2.8918,5.7898,5.2463,3.8727,0.5339,1.5408,0.7058,0.3399,2.3819,0.2922,0.022,0.11,1.3815,4.8389,1.0144,1.6595,0.2758,2.6187,1.1548,2.2047,1.2304,1.1362,2.0199,2.0078,2.8079,1.7588,0.565,2.0877,0.6271,0.4846,4.9368,5.7015,1.4642,1.488,2.2613,1.6045,1.6947,4.7784,1.0958,0.3677,3.1145,1.6656,5.2908,6.1183,5.9873,0.1614,0.2359,3.8249,2.3104,0.7982,1.4231,4.9671,0.0003,3.8794,2.6062,1.7787,1.2536,0.0541,2.717,1.6114,3.3326,2.9178,0.0832,2.7323,5.8913,0.1279,4.4056,0.176,5.5911,2.1488,2.2747,2.5539,1.8301,4.692,0.393,0.091,6.1246,1.6156,0.1132,0.6075,4.3491,4.1395,1.9113,2.4942,1.4031,2.92,0.9399,0.5999,1.3118,0.1755,0.9496,0.111,0.0705,0.1722,0.0797,3.0191,0.9032,2.8947,2.9099,0.239,1.2452,1.0395,4.9692,1.7138,3.6953,1.8345,0.7354,4.755,0.4903,1.3843,0.984,2.5059,0.6602,1.218,5.791,0.4362,0.0381,0.0021,0.0012,0.9392,0.3835,0.0985,0.1784,0.0039,0.0032,0.1074,0.0107,0.0346,0.0048,5.56,4.2435,0.9893,0.0714,0.0002,4.6433,0.6497,0.0061,1.4543,1.1218,1.1467,3.3266,3.5842,1.4222,0.2852,1.6495,4.3991,2.4595,0.4037]}

In the four games released, the Jane's Attack Squad always plays as the USA, but every game begins with the player facing off against a randomly chosen opponent who is, with a one in four chance, an enemy or ally of the USA. As a result, the game's four player roster is always US vs. any opponent, though in every single game, one player from each side replaces the other player during the course of the game. The game currently features the following players who have been made available during the series: \u2022 Jane's Attack Squad \u2022 Jane's Attack Squadron \u2022 Jane's Attack Squad \u2022 Jane's Attack Squad At the time of this writing, there are three full servers for the game available where Jane's Attack Squad characters are playable: www.mspsu.org - www.mspsu.org.de - www.mspsu.net - This is the game's official server hosted on the MSPSU servers. It is primarily the game's biggest dedicated server community that hosts almost every single game and many of them are free-to-play. If you wish to join, just click the \"join\" link on the site. The game is also available on Google Play, at the following address: https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=de.mspsu.janesattacksquads For an in depth history of the history of the Jane's Attack Squad series and the development studio behind the series, check out this article by Paul Clements at The Game Design Wiki : http:\/\/thegunner.com\/archive\/2013\/10\/17\/janes-attack-squads-history.html In any case, you can play the Jane's Attack Squad games on any of the servers listed above and enjoy your gameplay for free and with all of the players you want to play it with. They also feature many useful online features that can help you learn how to play with and against different players. For some players new to the series, however, you can also use the multiplayer game types and strategies found on those servers to learn how to beat the game without having to spend hundreds of dollars on a game.

{"id":794,"ended":false,"length":611,"gen_text":"The boundaries of two parliamentary constituencies divide Oldham : Oldham East and Saddleworth, and Oldham West and Royton ( which includes the town centre ), represented by Labour Members of Parliament Debbie Abrahams and Roger Godsiff. This is true since 2010 and, therefore, we can say for certain that if Labour were to have chosen the latter constituency for the selection, Labour would have had a strong candidate \u2013 indeed, the other seat with such a strong contender is the seat of Rochdale. If the selection were to have been in Oldham West and Royton where Rochdale is then it would have resulted in four new Labour MPs \u2013 all elected in 2010 with the largest majorities:\n\nHowever the following graph shows a very different result for Oldham West:\n\nBy winning such a large number of votes for one seat, the Labour Party's vote in Oldham East and Saddleworth doubled, which makes it easier for the constituency vote to influence the overall result in Oldham West and Royton than it would in, say, Oldham East \u2013 and the difference is even greater than it is in the other seat with a strong contender. Also, given the higher number of votes on average there for Rochdale constituency than there are for Oldham East, it is hardly surprising to find that the two seats combined for more votes than the other seat, Rochdale \u2013 so Labour had little room to manoeuvre.\n\nThe result is thus that there are four newly elected Labour MPs from Oldham West and Royton but only two newly elected Labour MPs from Oldham East and as such, the party's overall performance in Oldham West and Royton is very weak compared to the overall performance of the neighbouring seats:\n\nThis is also the result of the way in which Oldham is distributed across the county, as there are few seats which are as closely split between Labour and Conservative. For example, if we look at where the three lowest percentage vote shares went to the respective parties for the 2010 general election, we can see that only Oldham East and Poole ( with a very low Labour percentage of just 13%) went into the final count as being Conservative; and, in contrast, Oldham West and Royton went into the final count as being very close to having Labour %. So again, even as you would expect, Oldham West and Royton were strongly influenced by Conservative votes in the final count for 2010 and the seat has a very poor overall performance.\n\nIn summary, if we simply assumed that all of Oldham West and Royton voting was, on average, for the same candidate, then this would make a strong argument for choosing the incumbent Labour MP Debbie Abrahams on that basis \u2013 and this of course does not take our knowledge of the constituency's politics into account. We should also bear in mind that even if the final result had been much closer, the result of the election would still look very different for Oldham West and Royton \u2013 with the result for Oldham West being no better than in 2010, and for Royton in the same \u2013 but since Labour have now clearly lost Oldham West for the first time in living memory, I doubt that many of the voters at Oldham West and Royton polling booths would have been making that argument.\n\nAdvertisements","token_len":670,"entropy":[10.2096,0.5361,7.6906,9.7903,1.1657,8.0676,8.7603,0.197,12.1199,4.7495,0.0068,1.113,0.1567,0.021,0.0014,0.0002,1.965,2.0161,0.5206,0.0002,0.1879,0.1166,0.0038,0.0012,3.7232,7.9833,2.2021,1.4606,2.1051,2.0875,4.4165,8.149,0.1517,2.0143,6.731,0.3553,0.0394,7.9367,0.0021,0.0181,0.2722,4.2892,0.0548,0.0027,1.2528,4.3366,1.7372,6.2411,6.3703,3.1337,2.8248,3.708,4.3947,0.0357,4.5962,1.8022,2.4501,4.7937,0.8389,0.1325,4.1658,2.3327,2.1071,0.2869,4.652,5.8085,2.7505,4.3322,4.4224,2.7366,1.5769,4.2065,1.7674,4.3894,0.2172,0.424,3.0605,1.1188,3.5622,2.0748,4.9208,3.7383,0.4344,2.2253,5.3452,4.9823,2.8562,3.277,0.4052,1.8179,3.8027,1.5643,2.2653,1.5219,0.6506,3.2865,0.6528,0.0174,2.1773,3.9451,1.8332,2.5141,2.6208,1.2977,0.4471,0.3668,2.2457,1.457,0.0001,0.7208,0.8038,0.0089,0.0085,6.3953,5.0671,0.0262,0.0013,0.5177,4.5949,2.4678,0.7989,0.3561,5.6266,0.0141,6.703,5.2341,0.7555,0.2695,2.4081,4.041,4.5587,0.9349,1.1002,4.6697,1.9095,3.6876,1.6544,2.7759,2.3775,0.6484,4.6563,4.4107,5.2634,3.6882,0.6706,4.051,2.3887,0.1909,1.1336,2.932,1.5897,0.0,0.5534,3.6749,0.1267,0.0002,5.3306,4.2113,5.2564,0.3264,0.998,1.8123,0.0092,1.0933,3.1289,4.4953,1.8723,0.7859,1.6178,1.5657,0.8019,4.2231,1.5392,1.9699,0.5462,0.0001,3.923,0.8118,0.0051,0.0002,0.0067,5.5546,1.8225,3.7753,4.4523,1.3109,4.2736,0.9925,1.1198,5.5194,6.2656,0.4987,5.4365,0.2641,2.0879,0.6529,1.9937,0.9207,0.0,0.211,1.9064,0.0069,0.0025,4.1444,0.9727,0.9258,0.9318,5.9588,0.4803,0.0334,0.3851,0.0,0.3755,3.8648,2.405,2.5317,3.7762,0.8985,1.7768,1.273,1.6043,2.0907,1.8801,0.4765,1.5563,2.0961,1.0201,2.1343,1.3036,1.0151,0.8342,1.2819,6.2612,0.5386,4.3312,1.0181,5.215,2.2773,0.0045,0.7735,5.7267,3.692,4.4159,3.7093,5.1372,0.007,0.0008,6.7211,1.9364,2.1574,1.0582,0.3451,0.1184,0.0001,1.5746,0.9079,1.3048,0.7032,5.623,0.2071,3.3695,1.3133,0.4024,1.0752,2.9748,1.2835,5.2438,2.9907,2.4033,0.6835,0.5265,1.1546,2.3058,1.7164,2.5374,3.6378,0.0119,0.003,2.49,3.8582,3.3988,3.3615,5.1879,3.6819,1.1872,1.4097,0.0003,1.4082,0.5044,0.0003,2.0291,3.5755,2.2309,4.1103,0.8414,3.7099,1.4356,2.293,5.9734,0.4373,0.1945,0.0826,2.1988,0.4751,0.0001,0.6077,0.3294,0.1605,0.0017,4.0659,1.3915,1.0613,1.9449,0.126,0.2945,0.0188,0.1054,0.0833,0.0001,0.0621,0.5334,9.5041,1.8749,1.3923,1.3992,3.5496,1.7911,2.0816,4.3096,0.5472,0.788,0.0001,0.2563,0.6429,0.0183,0.0015,1.0123,3.0047,3.2974,2.653,0.1959,1.0555,3.3876,1.1821,0.9281,0.4291,6.604,2.1536,2.4813,0.1206,0.0002,2.4908,1.1246,3.3487,2.0412,2.7239,1.7202,0.5319,4.1699,1.6116,0.0029,2.6304,0.0002,3.2113,3.7754,1.8747,0.4362,3.642,2.2777,1.786,4.3238,0.4265,4.8664,1.9509,2.8265,0.6532,2.5418,3.447,2.5922,1.0058,1.1797,0.1056,0.4913,1.9541,2.9434,0.3813,0.1491,2.9455,1.2673,1.6113,0.0777,5.1348,0.6671,3.7808,5.3267,2.6016,3.8309,2.5283,3.0116,2.2292,1.8214,4.1806,0.4476,4.9285,0.7806,1.7922,1.3876,0.0368,0.7477,0.9016,1.3849,0.3084,0.3148,2.9603,2.2746,0.0004,1.2815,0.9514,7.4561,0.0003,2.4718,6.6948,0.6812,3.2304,1.4334,1.6599,3.2283,1.3554,2.7236,3.3575,1.4102,3.7767,4.2307,0.7002,3.8587,1.696,1.8066,2.0076,3.8563,5.2789,2.6171,2.9356,1.9431,1.866,0.1034,1.0458,0.0002,0.0895,0.3502,0.0062,0.0011,1.7856,0.0829,0.0328,0.4027,0.0382,0.0936,0.1438,4.3541,0.9303,0.1464,5.2259,2.2134,6.4165,1.7582,3.6194,5.6983,0.3263,4.2802,5.2238,5.3832,2.3822,0.1155,1.4494,2.7619,0.0001,0.1567,0.6975,0.0067,0.0005,2.9529,5.4617,1.2562,0.0455,6.0389,1.0505,1.4165,1.1242,0.8848,0.212,4.9313,1.6453,2.6248,2.5615,3.8938,2.9169,3.0302,1.0539,2.8603,2.016,1.0041,1.1375,0.233,0.0002,3.104,2.1205,0.1897,2.697,1.1655,5.8421,5.0006,0.1913,2.7567,2.0214,1.6925,0.0001,0.4115,0.3138,0.0071,0.0015,6.3604,2.0021,5.3763,1.8534,0.0997,0.0302,2.6607,1.0447,1.4635,3.0238,0.9489,0.7656,3.8561,0.4525,3.6743,3.153,2.8895,2.6248,0.2977,2.5584,1.2595,5.1711,1.1861,0.3744,1.2899,0.0004,0.0052,5.9372,4.371,0.4126,1.6969,2.2067,2.7299,5.2341,0.0019,3.7786,0.1563,0.6072,7.5737,1.4125,0.1116,0.584,1.8041,1.5104,3.6368,0.189,0.0301,0.4012,4.6058,2.4878,0.6753,2.4712,0.0052,0.0008,0.1851,4.0848,0.7223,1.7987,4.2094,1.2011,1.5148,0.4086,4.8122,0.7591,1.442,1.8102,3.175,2.5204,0.3616,2.3465,0.5207,1.3987,6.2745,1.4042,1.5129,3.4442,0.7707,0.0001,0.2265,0.4998,0.0258,0.0004,2.5335,3.7953,1.1306,2.4825,2.8873,1.0238,0.0001,0.3388,0.9097,5.9829,1.5641,0.2043,4.194,1.1457,1.247,1.2221,1.7713,0.2168,0.0006,5.6075,2.1683,1.7804,6.1224,3.1729,5.7548,2.9015,3.1043,3.7103,5.6228,2.1675,2.8711,0.0001,0.2361,5.2517,0.2842,0.609,0.0022,1.2086,5.1026,0.0014,0.2278,5.0139,3.311,0.6895,3.0614,2.9636,1.3415,2.764,4.9122,1.8582,0.0037,0.1477,1.132,0.0103,0.0005,4.4077,1.9383,1.2546,0.6193,1.2157,4.405,1.6493,2.8393,0.7038,0.4474,0.0002,2.4601]}
{"id":3513,"ended":true,"length":604,"gen_text":"A few days before Whiteside was old enough to sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United, he was offered a trial at Liverpool, causing United's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to find the teenager in the hope of making his move to Liverpool easier.\n\nBut Whiteside did not play any part in any of Liverpool's pre-season friendlies in the summer, a slight that could have done with an easy correction after his excellent performances during United's 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.\n\nWhiteside had made four outstanding performances for United that summer, scoring three goals in four games, and the fact that Liverpool were prepared to pay \u00a3500,000 to sign him could have been interpreted as a sign that Rodgers was keen to sign a striker. A \u00a310.8m deal was swiftly signed.\n\nThen, after a slow start to the season with Fulham, Whiteside was used more extensively by Rodgers and Liverpool during the second half of the season, and he had an impact, scoring an incredible 15 Premier League goals to help the Reds achieve safety.\n\nAt Spurs, Whiteside has found his goalscoring form again, and on Saturday will become the highest-scoring Swansea player of all time.\n\nAnd he was happy to help his new manager, who signed him from Sheffield United in 2011, by setting the most assists in the Premier League so far this season.\n\nAfter United, he joined Southampton, where he signed a five-and-a-half-year contract in February this year.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, after three unsuccessful loan spells at Sheffield United and Preston North End, and seven games in all competitions during the first half of last season, Whiteside left for Swansea City on loan.\n\nHis time at the Liberty Stadium did not last long; after a week in the Championship, he was recalled to the first team and is now firmly established in the side. At 26, he has just turned 27 and could yet feature for Swansea against Manchester City on Tuesday. He is also one of the most capped outfield players in Wales' history.\n\nSo, in the end, what did it take for Rodgers to make a decision on United's big-money summer target? What was Rodgers's approach to trying to sign the world's very best young forward? He said he had found Whiteside in one of the first team's dressing rooms and gave his scouting report on the young man after speaking with him to Neville. The former United captain found Reds officials \"mildly surprised\" and, although speaking to Neville, Rodgers said it was \"a case of who can beat who\".\n\nWhiteside is on course to win a medal for Wales at the summer Olympics and, after seven years at a very young age, he is set to become one of the big European strikers.\n\nThere is a feeling around the Welsh club that the winger is playing at such a high level because they have a new manager in place and a new approach to a position in midfield.\n\nFor United, the main man is David Moyes, who was sacked last week and will no longer be in

Stein stated he was `` glad `` he never played for the Mariners, although he later admitted that he regretted not being chosen for the club. In 1970 he began working in radio and TV production in Seattle. In 1972 he was hired as a radio announcer for Channel 2 FOX-6, broadcasting Seattle Mariners games. In 1975 he was hired by the Mariners to work as a broadcast meteorologist and he was later hired by Channel 1 FOX-6, Seattle Nationals baseball broadcasts. During the 1980s, Stein continued to work in television production. In the early 1980s he moved on to television production for KOMO, with which he also served as a weekend anchor. In 1980 he was asked by a Seattle radio station to be a co-host of the morning show with Rick Anderson and Greg Burke. He began to work from home and later did freelance radio work. As part of his continuing effort to stay healthy, he began working at a nutrition clinic during the offseason, which also helped improve his exercise regimen. In 1997 Stein went to the NFL Combine for the NFLPA's Talent Development and Education Program.\n\nEarly life:\n\nRonald Donald Stein (June 8, 1941 \u2013 present) was born in Seattle, Washington (U.S.A.). He moved with his family to Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada) as a boy. He moved to California as an adult and currently resides in California. When he was younger, as a child he loved playing baseball and even coached youth baseball teams for a short time, he later became involved with the Seattle Mariners minor league program, then as a college student, Stein received a full scholarship to the prestigious University of Washington. Upon his graduation from the University of Washington in 1975 Stein began working in radio and TV production. In the early 1980s he moved on to television production for KOMO, with which he also served as a weekend anchor.\n\nCareer:\n\nRonald Donald Stein began his career as an announcer for KOMO radio in 1982 when he was hired to do afternoon drive on the news. Two years later he began work in television production and was soon hired by Channel 7 FOX-6 as part of the team's daily sports rundown. The station's morning drive anchor, Ron Steele, also became Stein's immediate supervisor. He became the station's afternoon drive anchor in 1988 and became a co-host with Greg Burke. As a host and co-host Stein held onto the seat even though it was not in competition with Burke's seat and then he became co-host of that particular morning program and moved up from morning drive. Stein eventually went to the NFL Combine for the NFLPA's Talent Development and Education Program.\n\nWhen KOMO became Channel 7 FOX-6 in 1991 the station merged with FOX Sports-Seattle.

{"id":2589,"ended":true,"length":633,"gen_text":"After decades of stagnation and slow growth, Spokane businessmen formed Spokane Unlimited in the early 1960s, an organization that sought to revitalize downtown Spokane. A recreation park showcasing the Spokane Falls was built in 1965, and in the coming years major development efforts began. The downtown was redeveloped in the 1970s, and a freeway was built to the east, linking to the I-90\/SR-210 Beltline near the downtown.\nWith growth was also came crime. During the 1980s the area saw a dramatic increase, and the number of homicides rose from 22 in 1972 to nearly 60 by 1987. But these weren't the murders we're talking about now; many of the slain were the victims of targeted stalking and harassment. Some were even killed as part of a larger serial killing spree, which spanned over a decade.\nWith the increasing number of murders, the police department was called upon to devote large resources to solving them. In recent years, Spokane police have been actively pursuing serial killers who have targeted young, attractive women in Spokane using a myriad of methods.\nIn 1994, a 20-year-old woman named Stephanie Lynn Gentry was brutally murdered in a small town in Ohio. Her body was found in a wooded area, about a quarter-mile from her family's home. On the morning of January 5, Stephanie's lifeless body was tied up so tightly that she only had enough mobility to wiggle her toes. Her wrists were forced up behind her back and she was repeatedly beaten with a baseball bat.\nIn February 2005, another 20-year-old woman, Jennifer Mowbray, was stabbed to death in a similar fashion and her body was found the very same day in a wooded area about a mile away. This time, though, her wrists had been tied behind her back at the wrists, leaving her with at least a few inches of freedom when she could move her arms, something her family believes was a tactic used to make her easier for the killer to stalk over a period of several months.\nWhile this particular form of stalking isn't considered as horrific as the more common forms we've covered so far, when used over an extended period of time on an individual who has the potential to be victimized, it's a tactic that's sure to make anyone's dreams of moving to the suburbs come true. There are many other similar crimes in modern history, though. From the 1970s to the present, serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered over 22 young men and women. According to his mother, he would go to her house and, after he arrived, would lure new acquaintances to his home to assault, rape and kill them.\nIn 1998, Christopher Paul Curtis was arrested and confessed to more than 30 murders in Spokane \u2014 murders that included the rape and kidnapping of at least three underage girls. In an interview with KREM, he claimed that after he got bored with one of his previous victims, he'd lure more to a secluded location to stab them to death and consume their flesh in a way similar to

{"id":599,"ended":false,"length":611,"gen_text":"The final objective was Maryang San, a steep hill rising 200 metres ( 660 ft ) above the valley about 2 @, @ 500 metres ( 2 @, @ 700 yd ) west-southwest of the centre. The ridge was on the western edge of the valley and formed a dramatic backdrop for the final march. After the march the ridge was to be climbed, the two mountain peaks formed into a U with the summit as the base. This had been the original plan and when the conditions deteriorated, this was changed.\n\nThe four leaders were to climb the ridge simultaneously. The four leaders made their way to the summit together, one after the other, with one guiding and the other following; one would wait on top looking down to guide the second with a rope. The rope was to be pulled from the last person to reach the summit. One of the four leaders would stay on the ridge to see if the other three reached the summit, while the others ran downstream and descended the mountain. They left, with the aid of a tree limb, at 0800 on 28th June 1942. They found the other three climbers already descending the mountain. The leader on top of the ridge reached the summit at 0820, with the other two reaching the summit by 0845. From the summit the four started the descent to the river. When the others reached the lower village on the right hand side of the valley, the leader on top of the ridge was the last climber on the mountain.\n\nAt the base of the ridge a group of local people came along the ridge line, took photos and gave reports of the event. By the time news reached the base camp, word of the failure of the attempt had reached the front. The German forces had not moved east so their forces had been unable to contribute to any offensive action. The first attempt at the ridge was made in July 1940 and this was not the first high altitude ridge climb. On 14th June 1942 the ridge had been climbed by British Mountaineers. The British Mountaineers had established the first route to the summit of Monte Cassino by crossing the ridge at an altitude of 10,600 m, about 2.7 miles to the east of the original ridge route.\n\nThe ridge was climbed with ropes. The leader of the original climb, Sir Edmund Hillary, reached the top with a rope and had one last look over the ridge at the summit before descending. He had the option of walking to the village of Ipaldi, 2.6 miles away, or taking a helicopter with his body. His helicopter flew some 60 metres high for about 4 to 5 minutes before the parachute opened. His body fell to earth on the ridge, and shortly afterwards, Hillary himself fell from the same height.\n\nThe two leading climbers, Captain Thomas Haines and Sir Edmund Hillary, had met three days

{"id":4812,"ended":true,"length":624,"gen_text":"After the end of World War II, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( < unk > ) was formed. One of the first diplomatic contacts made with the new communist government was by the representatives of the USA and Great Britain.\nIt was the communist regime which had made Yugoslavia the largest exporter of wheat in the world.\nThe communist party that was supposed to play a part in the administration under the constitution that was introduced in 1949 was the Yugoslav Communist Party ( < unk > ).\nThe communists, on the other hand were still very unhappy at the fact that Yugoslavia, having been the largest wheat exporter, had been forced to limit its exports in order to meet the quota that the western powers had made for it.\nIt was only with the aid of the Soviet Union, which had long since signed an agreement with Yugoslavia, that the socialist government agreed to import grain, which was needed as the western powers were cutting supply to Serbia.\nFrom 1949 until the liberation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992, the socialist Federal Yugoslavia was a member of NATO.\nHowever, after the defeat in the Balkan war in 2000, the communist regime of Yugoslavia was declared not to have a territorial integrity, and consequently, it was not a member of the North Atlantic Alliance.\nTherefore the US, through the NATO's Alliance for Europe which was set up in 2001, became the first country in the world to put an embargo on the production of weapons and equipment for Yugoslavia, and subsequently on all the other communist regimes in the world.\nAnd that was as far as Yugoslavia went after that.\nYugoslavia went into a deep and long recession in 2004, with high inflation, a significant increase in unemployment, the destruction of its banking system, and in 2007, the imposition of sanctions on its exports.\nThere was no real recovery in 2008.\nIn 2008 the Croatian president Hoxha, took Croatia out of the European Union.\nIn 2009, the socialist government was overthrown by the Croatian fascist government, where the new nationalist politicians, Zoran Milanovi\u0107 and Ante Vedic, took Croatia out of the European Union, and declared that Croatian Croatia had to be admitted into the European Union.\nIn turn the EU was prepared to open up trade relations with the Croatian Croatian Republic, and also allow Croatian goods to be found on the French market.\nTherefore Croatian exports reached a record high in 2010, with the export of \u20ac 10 billion.\nAnd Croatian Croatia now found itself in a rather dangerous situation.\nIn 2011, it was again put in the European Union, but this time it was called the European Union of Great Republics ( EFR ). It replaced the old Yugoslav Republic, which was the most important socialist republic in Europe.\nHoxha made a dramatic announcement that his Croatian Croats would vote for independence from the Yugoslav republic of Yugoslavia, which had not existed since 1990.\nIn 2011 Croatia had a presidential election, in which the nationalist Croatian Croatian party Ustashas \u00a0won the parliamentary election. This was the first time in Croatian history that an EPR party won parliamentary elections.\nToday Croatia is no longer a member of the European Union, and Croatian Croatans are not citizens of any European country.\nToday it was no longer worth continuing to write about the history of Yugoslavia.","token_len":676,"entropy":[1.9443,5.4667,0.0337,2.5789,0.0028,0.2427,0.1979,1.2169,7.8667,3.7159,0.0093,0.2353,1.5111,1.7998,13.6454,10.4177,3.696,1.0482,0.8007,1.0785,1.8616,1.4829,5.79,0.1804,0.3729,1.5635,8.8879,5.1471,5.0736,1.8218,0.4607,2.9146,5.7994,1.4621,0.4229,1.9056,0.9856,5.3623,0.0283,0.3163,4.2575,1.1864,2.1902,0.0021,1.0415,2.5266,7.9689,0.43,2.5062,5.9421,2.3272,2.1656,3.5792,3.9976,3.1572,1.4737,3.6604,1.9083,0.0029,0.0709,3.6156,0.7118,0.3274,0.2108,0.9241,2.3823,1.6371,2.85,2.9119,5.8308,1.7368,5.6407,0.0053,5.2949,0.6891,5.1263,0.0511,0.4982,4.3633,5.5556,0.4072,4.8033,3.8213,0.6035,4.2532,0.9589,2.3642,1.56,2.1486,2.0043,0.2767,0.0224,0.5243,1.0266,0.9588,0.0626,0.0339,0.9965,0.7714,1.1214,3.9659,3.5727,4.4974,0.4595,0.3232,0.0171,4.7389,5.003,3.2653,5.9705,4.0696,0.2333,1.2885,0.032,2.1505,3.5731,3.7949,1.1289,2.1346,1.2394,1.7446,0.4269,0.0008,1.6687,0.9334,1.1159,3.1472,0.1486,5.3235,0.8219,1.0994,2.6041,0.8274,0.0425,2.1433,0.3497,4.201,2.529,1.2375,3.6906,0.769,0.6791,5.8336,0.9367,2.0453,0.2135,0.4555,3.1907,0.3229,3.3905,3.801,0.1934,3.9171,0.0512,0.4483,2.4924,0.0726,1.5725,1.3031,1.3228,5.2618,2.0311,5.0164,1.2603,0.6167,0.2695,0.4426,0.7666,0.1282,0.6955,4.9837,1.179,5.0156,0.104,5.276,2.9081,3.9755,2.0435,1.0319,3.8811,4.1218,2.0756,3.465,0.4505,1.1423,3.2532,6.8897,1.0341,5.1705,0.9233,0.2016,5.2049,2.3413,2.1652,1.2663,5.5376,0.1737,3.4823,2.0869,0.0096,0.0363,0.002,0.0056,0.0025,0.519,0.8421,0.271,0.933,2.4174,3.9101,6.7442,1.2555,2.5088,3.0868,0.0525,2.5796,0.783,0.587,3.8391,0.1545,2.2754,0.4645,4.3144,2.9955,0.57,1.8417,0.0016,1.9651,1.5306,5.7275,0.205,0.9676,3.3165,1.3994,2.9836,0.0709,1.1769,5.3627,4.4526,0.2614,1.8193,2.3763,4.1857,0.5737,1.6942,0.8088,4.3545,1.5527,2.0823,0.5613,2.3896,1.5364,0.1554,0.0264,0.9028,2.5691,0.0041,2.3495,0.3465,0.2187,4.7133,3.8821,4.2632,2.4101,5.6681,0.989,1.6974,3.9569,5.6472,0.1872,3.0038,5.7545,1.0592,2.4536,0.0085,0.4531,3.0498,0.1407,3.6311,0.4288,1.8811,1.7818,2.606,0.1741,0.2987,0.123,5.3614,2.1126,0.8267,0.1702,1.1769,4.0359,0.3799,4.013,1.0825,2.5988,1.0247,1.8883,1.9515,1.523,4.6959,2.833,1.7892,1.7545,1.8075,1.1322,1.2336,1.1238,0.6334,0.8486,0.2412,0.1381,5.2322,3.4471,1.394,6.4935,0.2411,0.0134,3.3993,1.8176,3.572,1.564,0.3276,0.427,5.4738,0.0556,0.0075,0.0783,4.116,2.1953,1.0206,0.9722,3.3534,1.5526,2.1444,1.8031,4.3949,0.9082,2.6128,4.3307,1.469,1.3676,2.5674,5.2122,2.531,0.0762,0.3405,0.6813,3.2788,4.5542,0.0229,2.506,3.1379,0.078,0.5863,0.6646,5.0638,3.8673,0.7867,0.9696,4.7787,0.0233,3.4221,1.8776,2.538,2.6736,1.072,0.1497,4.9127,0.8726,2.0097,3.8306,2.4966,1.8436,1.9083,1.5225,0.7071,1.565,3.2495,2.118,5.6288,3.5174,4.5477,3.2301,0.0094,1.5836,6.2024,5.3827,0.5569,0.0104,0.1321,1.4861,0.1211,1.3339,0.6066,1.7654,0.7876,0.6422,0.884,3.562,1.5751,3.2485,1.4423,0.0004,1.1494,0.9977,2.1002,5.411,3.1058,1.3844,7.358,1.283,3.9244,5.4606,5.7706,1.8767,3.9323,0.4946,0.1782,1.0701,0.0407,0.2485,2.8383,0.0015,5.4322,3.0092,0.1359,2.5399,4.9771,0.3257,0.0151,0.1348,0.6167,0.0127,2.0707,0.7208,3.9341,2.0441,3.6594,4.2966,3.2589,1.9876,1.1167,6.3035,1.3005,0.5749,0.9263,0.092,0.9491,0.125,1.3794,7.0266,2.6358,1.7414,3.6127,4.9987,0.0318,4.522,1.6938,2.8571,1.3456,0.0974,2.2448,1.6492,3.552,1.097,0.9037,1.9791,3.6262,3.8926,1.0664,2.6088,0.3611,0.4246,6.955,1.2311,0.3268,5.4609,0.917,0.4193,0.1403,5.6595,3.5518,3.4989,5.7146,1.3667,1.4852,0.6028,0.9516,0.8743,0.6675,1.8763,1.9087,2.868,0.0796,4.5592,5.6544,1.0249,1.0748,0.1542,3.2691,3.1344,4.9257,4.9145,4.156,0.1269,0.9101,0.994,5.2118,4.4779,0.3032,0.7155,0.2299,2.2686,1.1446,0.5015,3.7838,0.7174,4.7845,4.7699,2.2244,1.4821,2.598,0.1553,0.8273,1.0159,1.3452,0.0198,1.7334,0.4765,3.9931,0.1469,2.0051,1.0373,0.1023,3.7299,5.5454,0.0399,1.1192,3.3541,2.5144,1.234,4.1581,6.1206,0.3322,2.0318,2.0811,1.4703,2.4132,1.1314,1.0294,3.0133,3.9226,2.2434,3.1215,1.878,0.364,0.6663,0.6644,0.1484,5.627,0.3987,0.0029,5.9893,1.101,4.9442,2.5913,1.8904,3.6581,3.6545,5.8148,0.0528,0.9289,5.528,0.8484,3.0469,1.1932,1.1479,3.3565,2.6815,2.4132,1.5789,1.2598,2.5479,1.984,3.9986,1.503,0.9666,5.1873,0.4792,0.1883,2.2127,2.8662,1.8636,3.0632,1.3789,3.5966,0.1156,0.8627,1.942,0.0233,0.8627,2.7012,1.8864,2.624,1.1326,6.078,0.1237,3.6898,0.0045,5.1454,0.0361,1.4172,0.9184,4.1951,1.4873,0.9573,3.9604,1.1189,1.0339,0.455,0.3837,1.4277,1.5858,0.0545,0.159,2.9991,5.278,5.0168,1.7566,1.4258,3.3014,0.202,0.2516,0.1937,6.3307,1.2913,0.4756,4.7346,0.2343,0.5346,1.2129,0.03,0.2378,0.5611,0.0061,0.728,1.3579,5.2943,3.7097,3.047,1.0579,2.2364,3.368,0.0549,2.1737,1.4402,0.4617,0.264,0.3149,3.9361,3.8111,4.6591,5.781,0.7322,4.8459,5.0424,1.479,2.6526,0.6071,0.8066,1.9678,0.0826,1.564,1.0415]}

[jump] During the game's development, Jackson talked about the possibility of doing a trilogy of movies. \"We've got three films planned. We have already shot some footage for The Walking Dead with two of the people who were in the first film; we're doing a flashback scene for season 2. If we get this right, what we want to do is do two films. As a filmmaker, I can't say what direction we'll pick, but this was an opportunity that came up and I really hope that we can do it.\" Kirkman added that, \"It's so important to have the trilogy, because it will give some of the other world it's based on context, and make things easier for our audience. A three-part film is easier to understand and understand what's going on in the world.\" Jackson further commented, \"It's the way to give the characters some depth: The first film is a great success and now hopefully we can start the second and third.\"\n\n(via The Guardian and GamesRadar )\n\n(via the Entertainment Software Association )\n\n(via PopMatters )\n\n(via Crave )\n\n(via Crave

{"id":3951,"ended":true,"length":645,"gen_text":"MSU has several residential colleges, based on the Oxbridge `` living @ - @ learning `` model. By putting classes in student dormitories, these colleges improve student access to faculty and facilities, and offer students more control over their academic lives. But these colleges differ from most colleges because they have individual programs offered for students from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, and to accommodate their varying living arrangements. Students also have access to campus-based career training and training for professional certification programs. Students and faculty at these colleges have made a strong commitment to academic excellence and to living at a campus. With the exception of the four private colleges, all have demonstrated that they are committed to living in more than one campus, and have demonstrated that they have a strong track record of providing a wide range of living options to their students. Students at these colleges often choose to live in more than one residence hall, offering them convenience in moving between residences when possible. In addition, students choosing to live in more than one campus generally find the living arrangement to be less disruptive to their academic and personal lives.\n\nMany colleges have their own residence hall. These residence halls may be based on a variety of features and arrangements, such as academic hall, common area, or student service center type. These dormitories are very convenient for students living at the colleges, because the various residences are located in close proximity (approximately 1 mile distance ). In addition, dormitories provide residents with free meals. These dormitories provide residents with access to campus life, the faculty at the college, and most other campus services. Many students find the residence halls easier to communicate with than the residential colleges. Additionally, most living-learning colleges have very comfortable dormitories, including residence hall housing.\n\nAll residence halls, dormitories and other residence facilities are designed to attract, accommodate, and support their students. These residence halls, dormitories and other residence facilities may be individually designed or may be built to serve multiple campus communities. Residence halls, dormitories and other residence facilities have been designed to be comfortable, including having multiple areas of activity, such as a community room or living room. The residents, often in groups of six to eight, may congregate in these rooms and have the opportunity to make friends. These features also help to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in the dormitory housing.\n\nThe campuses generally maintain a reasonable sense of community. When visiting a campus, students usually will not likely encounter anyone who is not a campus employee or student. Additionally, students are typically welcomed and encouraged to attend college events at the campuses, not just in the college's home areas. The campuses usually have athletic programs for both physical and academic training. Some schools also offer summer school for students to allow them to participate in a variety of campus activities and to connect with other college students. Some campuses are also home to colleges of medical, law, business, engineering, veterinary, education and computer science, to name a few. In addition, these campuses generally offer a variety of programs to support the college programs by offering college tours and giving information.\n\nResidence halls also may be called residence colleges. Some residence colleges accept students who have already attended the larger campus as their students; some residence colleges offer residence halls with different restrictions and admissions requirements for students from the smaller campuses.","token_len":678,"entropy":[4.8423,3.9096,6.1417,7.3929,2.2731,1.3498,8.2898,0.2955,1.3566,13.0205,0.1062,15.0028,14.1884,13.8224,7.7775,8.7983,8.6761,3.2973,0.2727,0.7258,6.7243,6.1373,6.1409,1.105,4.6873,4.8526,0.4201,0.0003,0.4452,3.9062,0.5128,5.9209,1.974,3.8763,0.3623,4.1976,0.9893,4.2686,1.0742,1.2162,4.0657,1.7637,2.4012,3.9039,0.0896,0.4017,2.1731,1.7492,0.1463,4.9053,3.0193,0.9282,6.0157,0.4952,2.8364,3.1895,3.0332,0.3759,2.6474,5.3438,4.1755,5.3024,3.2248,2.1197,3.7002,1.9647,1.1433,0.002,2.3439,0.3008,2.0196,1.3715,5.3232,3.3367,3.0192,2.6299,5.4238,1.7095,0.4104,3.4225,3.7504,1.1231,2.8006,0.0156,3.7432,2.1531,0.6766,3.9063,3.3851,1.3238,5.521,2.2377,4.2877,3.0669,2.7804,0.6366,3.1927,3.5484,1.8716,2.1504,2.052,0.3283,2.3586,4.3179,2.121,2.6293,0.3659,0.0283,4.8256,0.638,1.1041,1.5425,6.0318,2.1066,1.8438,2.1433,1.9542,5.2915,1.4837,2.7299,0.0021,1.2538,5.115,5.5744,0.6456,0.6512,1.0265,3.2395,4.642,2.2762,0.463,1.0385,1.978,0.0222,4.4985,2.3694,6.3566,1.5819,0.6155,2.4402,1.9011,0.8774,2.5785,3.6582,0.9172,0.3283,1.7466,2.1712,1.6017,3.9508,0.002,0.2519,2.4549,1.7533,3.5954,0.4909,0.0057,4.3655,1.0946,1.4941,1.0752,0.1324,0.1497,4.0443,1.3784,1.3138,0.537,4.0936,3.1879,0.5986,0.1394,0.8976,4.9794,0.0468,0.0062,1.7739,0.3577,1.307,5.9637,1.8475,6.1698,2.8448,3.5206,1.177,2.6045,3.4997,4.6215,0.3088,2.8408,0.6702,0.3397,1.7411,7.2295,0.3503,0.0779,0.6768,0.6095,0.0021,0.0047,2.4265,4.248,3.4996,2.3851,3.4229,3.893,1.6343,0.064,2.8879,2.0568,1.1348,0.3599,0.6508,1.9812,0.9151,0.2648,1.0824,2.8397,0.0062,5.2298,2.2068,1.5775,5.2002,0.3224,2.2479,1.8518,3.3949,1.7972,1.9809,0.0208,3.1941,0.608,5.6364,0.0876,1.54,1.975,0.0017,4.3823,2.5756,5.2027,0.6844,1.3186,0.0037,5.1468,4.0323,0.7718,3.9843,1.534,0.173,1.1661,2.6943,5.1139,0.9197,7.9643,0.6763,2.7655,3.1783,0.1589,0.0001,1.4255,5.2981,2.7413,0.9117,0.2717,3.7168,1.6747,1.1363,3.4922,0.7279,2.7567,2.8616,6.0751,3.8283,1.0764,1.8297,1.9325,0.406,0.0134,5.6517,3.2877,2.681,1.0119,4.4603,8.0521,3.099,0.3375,0.0929,4.3214,0.2037,0.0004,1.7691,4.5769,0.2384,5.6696,3.0815,3.4969,3.2014,0.9421,0.0847,0.0003,2.9199,2.9676,0.1316,2.8873,0.0063,2.7229,4.5058,0.9847,4.3144,2.5611,5.1796,0.2416,1.1905,0.1085,0.3374,5.8078,2.9743,2.2299,1.3981,0.3936,3.005,2.1309,2.8764,1.8123,2.4886,1.0383,5.5713,0.1199,5.5993,0.1009,1.8411,1.6091,2.4922,0.3398,0.9302,5.1424,0.0073,3.8261,5.6072,4.6072,0.8414,3.3037,1.0602,5.5023,5.4113,2.2212,0.2317,0.0001,1.1841,3.9923,5.6396,0.9238,4.741,1.2315,1.21,0.0002,4.5905,2.6207,0.1275,3.3933,3.2687,0.0234,0.0,2.0766,1.9657,2.6448,1.7279,0.9232,2.5437,0.6677,6.4662,2.5362,1.8409,0.8615,0.1556,2.0435,4.6666,1.9465,0.6256,2.7202,3.4545,0.2893,1.2055,0.1375,0.0095,0.0001,0.5989,0.0767,0.2825,0.0344,4.1707,0.8186,4.8322,0.9396,1.5913,1.9288,0.5813,2.8644,1.7156,4.3423,3.5482,3.3583,1.9195,0.3763,4.7526,0.1666,0.4337,0.9535,0.0482,0.0041,0.0,0.3231,0.0251,0.0885,0.0143,3.5737,2.0535,0.3525,0.4599,2.4322,2.2912,0.7163,6.4879,4.4145,4.4057,4.8407,2.2451,5.4054,0.969,2.4136,0.0034,2.0894,4.4049,1.0421,1.941,5.3215,0.3407,1.1784,2.4582,5.236,4.1279,4.7959,2.7998,2.2286,1.1174,2.6902,1.5977,0.7851,0.6593,2.2573,5.1015,0.0005,0.433,2.0022,2.2815,2.5407,2.4136,3.1934,0.6638,0.068,5.1588,0.9345,1.4021,2.6541,5.66,3.6929,1.9623,1.3948,2.9637,0.5284,6.005,3.9561,0.9639,1.4906,1.7473,1.5445,0.9937,2.0604,1.1755,4.7894,0.5693,0.921,0.0002,2.2697,5.9563,5.0374,4.6327,1.18,4.6757,5.3177,0.0026,1.6808,1.6448,5.1792,5.0926,1.4285,0.2222,0.1474,0.6177,3.7581,3.6213,2.5049,6.7204,1.4876,3.4563,0.8795,0.7713,0.8409,0.8216,2.6434,1.9059,0.9845,1.4601,0.2516,4.8371,0.0076,1.8635,1.7725,3.3444,3.9359,2.0298,1.885,0.0754,2.6181,4.9016,1.3124,3.144,0.6453,1.7248,1.5275,6.5786,0.9555,2.5473,0.8897,4.4353,1.8968,4.023,5.9833,0.1257,2.6254,1.3064,3.8101,1.3141,4.6627,2.1338,2.6997,3.2466,4.5545,0.7689,1.9241,3.6146,0.7305,3.7297,3.5291,1.3763,0.973,3.7302,2.2982,2.6061,0.9709,3.1743,5.8509,0.1815,0.1263,3.8931,0.0936,2.6133,0.7943,0.0034,2.6168,0.3683,2.53,1.5769,5.607,0.2584,1.2608,2.096,0.1012,0.3179,3.6504,1.9184,3.3369,1.7335,1.2296,0.0568,4.7519,1.2678,4.388,1.187,2.1594,0.2866,0.8036,0.3634,2.0525,0.3417,3.6434,0.6296,2.2605,1.6832,6.0062,0.1881,2.5342,2.7931,0.0403,0.306,0.0041,0.1209,3.8895,0.1987,0.14,3.8754,0.5656,3.8724,1.94,1.8395,0.5925,0.0042,3.8239,2.1519,2.7609,1.6139,2.4904,4.7746,6.6149,1.433,4.9423,4.2829,1.6956,5.0558,3.0063,3.5086,0.709,0.0002,4.1236,0.287,1.146,4.5436,3.1126,0.8365,4.9629,1.2402,2.9262,1.4168,3.2089,2.1428,0.5713,6.8627,1.5181,1.7567,2.1128,3.0154,2.0114,2.5431,5.7571,2.4863,3.7338,2.9663,1.349,3.8487,2.4695,1.1983,0.0666,3.4677,3.6624,0.7675,3.9828,3.4164,5.2687,2.1164,4.8042,0.7677,1.7321,0.9648,3.0953,1.5729,2.4153,1.4884,0.2252]}
{"id":117,"ended":false,"length":590,"gen_text":"Markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the Fleet would have been in action for several nights until the first fleet leave at Brest on 31 October. In all the vessels would have fought until the day the Armistice was signed, despite a loss of 14 ships. In the event only two ships lost life during the action. During the four day attack the Royal Navy made no significant attack on German air power during this entire period of the battle. The Germans claimed four planes shot down and one torpedoed. On the 4th October the Germans launched a raid but were driven off on the morning of the 5th. In a last attempt the German attack on the 24th was repulsed. As a result more than 80 ships lay in port with the bulk of the battle fleet out at sea, but it would be the largest naval battle and the most costly naval battle in history, to end in a draw. A huge amount of money and treasure was destroyed.\n\nAs a thank you to Gertrude Stein for writing and sending the poems for her to read to the crew of the S.S. Duke of York (a very popular ship in the United States at the time), the Duke of York was presented the Victory Medal in 1918.\n\nThe Victory Medal\n\nAfter the war, Churchill was the recipient of a lot of medals, including the British Order of Merit (the only British war hero to be awarded as such, apart from Winston Churchill), the Distinguished Service Order and various lesser gallantry awards. At the same time he also fought hard to have the Victory Medal abolished. In 1926, on the 70th anniversary of the Armistice, at the request of the Earl of Pembroke, Churchill announced that he would not receive the medal in any future year. On June 14th 1926, the day after the death of Princess Margaret, the Order of the British Empire replaced the Distinguished Service Order. In November 1949, after an amendment to the British Commonwealth Medal Act, the decoration of the Victoria Cross was removed from the medal list and the order became entirely redundant.

{"id":2992,"ended":false,"length":572,"gen_text":"Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96, in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials. A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius, who alleges that Tiberius' sons are the true conspirators.[4] The other conspirators were Calpurnius Piso and Nerva, although those two seem to have been in Rome at the time of the conspiracy. Suetonius claims that the conspirators were also involved in the murder of Quintus Caecilius Metellus and the attempt on Nero's life, although that theory seems unlikely.[12] Calpurnius Piso was found guilty and banished; Nerva was slain by the Caesars on 8 December.[12] A large part of Suetonius' story, however, is contradicted by evidence: the Caesars found fault with Calpurnius Piso and probably did blame him for the assassination (as they did Metellus). The alleged motive and the circumstances surrounding the murder are, however, not in dispute.[4]\n\nSuetonius made some of the key elements of the assassination appear more plausible than they in fact are: Calpurnius Piso had some connection to the conspiracy, and Nerva was believed by some members of the senate to have committed the murders of Calpurnius and Calpurnius's two sons, Tiberius and Agrippa. However, despite his reputation as a source of historical fact, Suetonius is not considered a reliable source of historical facts in his own time. The two major arguments in favor of the suicide hypothesis of Calpurnius Piso are that (1) Tiberius was an extremely sensitive man and, therefore, would have not dared kill Nerva, and (2) the two brothers were extremely close and Tiberius was the real perpetrator of the murder. Other theorists have challenged the suicide hypothesis, citing an extremely strained account from Suetonius' time;[4] there was a history of internecine fights between the Caesars and their opponents in the last days of the Republic, for which people could be considered conspirators;[12] and the two brothers themselves were notoriously difficult to control; some even claimed they were a little too close to Tiberius.[13] Calpurnius Piso's brother Agrippa was never declared dictator, and the two brothers had a strained relationship.[14]\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that Suetonius' story is more reliable than it appears at first glance: he was, in fact, reliable. However, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that his story is entirely invented and based on unreliable sources. It is possible that Suetonius made the story up to please his boss Verres. Verres made a great show of his loyalty by having Suetonius write a biography on him,[15] which in turn provoked Tiberius to write one on Suetonius; both writings are held in the British Library.[16][17]\n\nCitation for this article:\n\nRabalais, Yves. 2011.

{"id":1360,"ended":false,"length":624,"gen_text":"After progressing through the ranks, Torres won his first important youth title in 1998. Atl\u00e9tico sent an under @ - @ 15 team to compete in the Nike Cup, in Spain and lost 2-0 in the finals. The next year, Torres scored 15 goals to join his club's first team. Torres did not play until September 1999, for the rest of the time he played as a second striker under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, helping the first team to three times win the league and two Champions league titles.\n\nHe played a huge role in four La Liga triumphs and won UEFA Cup, World Club Cup and Club World Trophy. His goals helped the first team to win three La Liga titles, and he also scored on the penalty spot in Champions League. In 2004, he got his hand on his first La Liga title by scoring 6 goals to help Madrid to their fourth Spanish title. He signed for Chelsea for $13million and scored 12 times in his league exploits. He helped win FA Community Shield, Club World Cup, and UEFA Super Cup in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, he got his big break as Chelsea's first team squad, and scored in the Chelsea 2-0 victory over Manchester United. His career was a nightmare from there. Torres' contract with Chelsea was up at the end of the 2006\/07, and he became free. He was then playing under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Inter Milan and then moved to Liverpool for \u20ac13million, where he was not as successful. This is where things got very ugly and violent. In February 2007, Torres was arrested for the brutal attack of a woman in a Paris bar, while in July he was fined \u20ac10,000 for assaulting an off-duty soldier after he was refused a lift by a cab driver. In February 2008, he was arrested by Spanish police after causing a \u20ac15,000 damage at the Madrid home of his girlfriend, and then on March 28, he was fined \u20ac100k for driving without license. A year later, Torres was found guilty of assault during a drunken brawl with Spanish referee Vicente Martinez when Chelsea was defeated by Valencia, while during that same year he left Liverpool for Atl\u00e9tico, where he was not able to score again.\n\nChelsea decided to sell Torres to Atletico Madrid for \u20ac25million. Torres has not scored a goal since January 2012, but he still enjoys his football, though he is far from being satisfied. Torres has yet to start on the Spanish Super Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, while Atl\u00e9tico has lost their final game. He is not quite happy with his life in Spain, where he is not in the best football club anymore and he is not playing competitive football. Torres was offered a contract with Atletico, but he refuses it. One of the main reason for this refusal is the fact that he is gay, who also says there was much pressure from the club at first, \"It was difficult at first, but then I thought about how they felt. I was being asked about my sexual preference in a way that really wasn't in the slightest bit appropriate, even if I was aware that that was a topic that was being studied in that football club. It had a negative impact.\"\n\n[youtube]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lgRmFIYO5K8[\/youtube]","token_len":679,"entropy":[10.3053,1.1227,0.6604,4.6766,1.1655,10.0069,5.342,2.5144,0.2945,8.0059,8.1793,2.0356,1.1227,3.9632,2.2645,9.3203,0.0156,0.0,7.8687,4.8287,5.3604,16.9644,10.0789,9.6314,7.6389,6.53,0.7836,3.7983,0.4225,0.4199,8.2851,3.5324,1.9856,3.9967,4.7785,4.7899,3.8489,2.2503,0.0805,0.8917,2.6263,0.5739,2.1511,0.8964,2.5749,1.9841,0.4368,0.8013,1.1286,2.8685,3.9703,0.0616,3.9875,5.0941,3.0314,4.6679,1.2893,0.9038,0.6177,0.919,2.5678,4.5926,0.2302,1.8628,3.0132,3.3706,2.0641,0.6308,5.74,1.8303,3.8761,0.0189,0.2159,6.4332,0.4788,1.9443,1.7049,0.2704,2.9532,1.4032,4.1711,3.2514,0.9395,2.0262,4.8265,1.525,4.3005,0.0317,0.8812,3.861,6.3586,2.2305,0.3286,1.3486,1.9969,2.6925,2.1959,4.8927,0.4193,0.219,1.0835,0.0244,3.8123,3.4536,2.9336,3.3538,0.4518,0.3026,6.7417,3.3444,0.0576,4.5373,0.0547,1.8814,3.3842,6.7949,0.7125,1.9844,4.8462,1.2314,0.2405,0.6458,2.4347,0.0118,5.9595,1.2013,3.4492,3.8985,2.0701,1.9055,2.5185,0.0434,0.6914,1.5088,3.0201,2.7924,0.0605,0.182,1.3222,3.19,2.1444,1.7613,1.898,4.6651,1.5106,3.3103,0.4437,0.8371,4.5973,0.1843,1.889,2.2434,3.1203,0.486,1.2787,4.9543,0.7695,6.0005,0.3321,3.5316,0.2525,2.5539,0.0268,1.2489,4.3836,0.2766,6.221,0.1144,3.2667,0.6669,4.3609,1.1048,2.5284,3.0523,3.8934,0.7628,0.481,2.1439,5.4993,1.2684,1.494,2.5033,3.8278,4.0679,3.9264,2.1776,2.6325,3.8162,2.9756,0.3879,1.4257,7.0693,7.7843,0.8102,2.061,3.6823,3.9288,3.7457,4.6606,0.0101,1.2903,5.0548,0.0212,0.0519,1.2835,1.616,1.2282,1.0513,0.0529,1.6999,1.3593,0.6794,1.1777,0.0002,1.4609,0.9875,0.2311,1.3276,2.8663,0.5507,3.3862,0.4439,2.7245,2.6738,1.4665,1.9002,1.3573,6.3996,3.6803,1.6525,2.0954,3.8015,1.0971,5.2586,2.71,0.1545,0.7368,1.4254,0.4376,1.3318,0.1686,1.1962,3.1194,3.8987,1.8869,4.0092,5.6579,3.24,1.2684,1.9274,1.7906,3.3545,3.25,1.7635,0.1812,0.8605,3.1761,2.1388,0.04,0.0693,0.0029,0.2889,1.9662,1.1715,0.4613,5.6319,0.5848,0.6538,5.186,4.5395,2.3362,0.9283,2.5285,3.4653,5.2625,3.9574,2.6381,0.0092,0.9072,1.2644,0.1415,1.9614,4.166,2.4531,0.1603,2.0856,1.5786,2.3128,3.9704,0.5057,2.7785,1.8761,0.0847,2.8889,3.552,2.573,0.7441,0.6152,5.9665,2.5177,1.4592,2.7426,1.751,3.4467,3.003,3.4837,5.5046,0.4204,3.1052,3.0452,0.8451,0.1214,0.6453,0.8037,1.6779,0.8639,1.6072,3.3299,2.434,1.0465,0.8248,1.9797,1.0304,1.6939,5.1596,1.8709,1.5505,4.498,2.0678,2.3299,1.7528,0.4167,4.2004,0.5596,2.741,0.1221,0.0361,0.6041,1.8958,2.9278,2.9298,0.2482,0.0047,5.5733,4.1085,3.011,1.3515,2.7932,1.627,2.941,2.7577,1.1399,2.5871,0.339,0.3319,2.0242,3.4158,0.4605,0.1564,0.6868,0.3913,2.0466,3.0902,2.0403,0.1775,2.0877,5.8031,0.6229,6.3756,3.3738,0.2556,0.0267,1.2568,2.5499,1.6032,2.7013,1.9929,0.0137,1.3864,1.9693,1.7695,2.6091,2.922,4.1055,3.3168,3.4715,0.8175,1.5457,0.3063,2.9388,0.1501,4.6074,5.4053,0.4873,4.428,1.2088,5.0502,0.7845,5.0981,2.6809,0.1005,0.3523,1.8464,0.658,3.5191,0.1588,0.2941,2.1002,4.502,0.497,4.3892,0.9634,1.1555,5.4004,3.9266,3.4128,0.0271,4.1837,5.3878,2.4462,3.562,3.7987,1.2092,2.3305,3.1754,4.4353,5.6191,4.1447,1.062,2.1023,0.8872,5.3796,1.3891,0.6807,2.0938,0.001,0.0001,3.4918,1.3034,0.1384,2.1986,2.3396,2.5829,0.0035,3.2589,3.3722,0.5067,0.8481,0.0002,5.6592,4.5895,0.2913,1.0196,0.2919,1.0862,2.8805,0.4448,0.5635,1.0177,0.6374,3.1192,0.6091,1.8284,1.9398,4.2295,1.9566,2.0153,1.1267,0.9527,1.6175,3.5705,2.4671,0.8018,2.3068,1.3033,2.2649,5.3686,2.593,1.1789,1.923,5.7558,0.9627,1.2828,4.6505,0.3373,1.4755,5.2691,0.941,1.9276,1.7376,5.5217,0.0134,4.4762,5.0777,0.8999,1.7549,4.2456,0.7748,2.684,2.0341,2.2624,1.4769,0.0267,1.0824,3.2198,2.7032,0.011,0.0011,2.0414,3.3835,2.8771,4.9891,3.9178,3.5285,2.6202,1.6183,2.6402,5.7962,2.1724,0.7721,0.9036,3.1047,1.7303,0.6506,0.7878,3.5631,0.3637,1.4702,1.6751,4.0418,0.398,2.0383,4.1065,2.0552,3.7469,2.1565,1.9461,1.1568,1.092,1.795,5.3536,0.8592,0.5689,2.187,3.3226,4.2537,1.0036,2.1613,1.1426,3.7172,0.1705,2.019,0.2903,1.0273,4.6766,2.5319,0.894,6.5946,1.2342,0.6915,1.9793,3.7072,1.5916,1.399,1.7414,0.3933,1.5572,1.2699,0.0799,1.2009,1.6842,6.6093,1.2108,5.0409,3.9088,4.1718,6.087,3.6104,5.0981,1.4879,0.8266,1.44,1.3109,5.5607,2.783,1.4052,6.3641,3.5163,0.5904,1.8799,2.1715,0.1729,0.9992,1.2812,2.7778,0.7003,3.8076,1.3735,3.2619,5.0773,4.3997,1.884,1.1754,2.5741,5.2654,3.0085,2.5296,0.9416,1.5659,2.7462,3.2694,2.277,2.3791,0.4521,5.6337,3.8654,0.0011,5.0201,1.1908,4.6826,0.5128,2.4962,2.3565,3.6425,1.0442,1.3911,1.949,4.6873,1.064,4.0928,0.5677,2.1017,2.73,1.0744,0.9925,1.9043,5.7208,1.3576,4.0559,4.7519,0.3414,1.1926,1.9282,4.8268,2.0518,2.1208,0.7611,3.2849,0.5659,0.0002,4.9093,2.3751,2.0377,1.2309,0.0002,0.1345,0.0013,0.0019,0.0014,0.0002,0.0014,0.0037,0.0014,0.0039,0.0286,4.5073,4.3738,4.2967,3.9881,7.0621,3.9383,4.7925,3.6969,4.3547,2.2617,0.0969,0.0009,0.0116]}

For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the arrival of the workers with \" The General in his Labyrinth, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez voices his political views through the character of the General. For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the arrival of the workers with \" In all realities [the workers] are our enemies,\" the General tells the workers he has come to \"take from them their jobs, their benefits, their pay, their social rights, and above all their autonomy.\"\n\nIn the novel, the General never speaks but is only represented by a character named La Fortuna, who represents his desire to live a life of luxury and a large house.\n\nIn the book and the film, the General was also an anti-socialist, who believed that workers who got sick or died should be left to themselves to die. In the film, he is also known as \" El Se\u00f1or Raval\u00f3n,\" a name that means \"The Great Warden\" and is Spanish for \"The Great Inquisitor.\"\n\nAnother character based on the General is a character named El Se\u00f1or Raval\u00f3n, named after one of the fictional generals who were also killed by the rebels. In the film, the character is a \"wealthy, egotistical\" doctor who is the \"boss of the hospital.\" The General is also depicted in the film as a womanizer as well, and is shown to be somewhat unapologetic about having a mistress, and he is known as the \"Sultan of Pleasure, \" as well as a \"devil on both a horse and in the flesh.\"\n\nAs the General is the central figure in the novel, the film adaptation gave him a new name, \" El General,\" which translated from English means \"The General.\"\n\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's work in this novel and the film can also be directly linked with his writings, which include many essays and articles, as well as short stories, about how he felt when leaving Cuba.\n\nOn March 23, 1960, the day after Castro's victory in Cuba's communist revolution, Jorge Luis Borges passed away at the age of 86. He had only been born on October 4, 1898 and moved to Cuba as a child. He had to pay a fine and serve a prison sentence for having \"stolen\" a loaf of bread during an episode of \"bread riot\" protests in 1906\u201307. In an interview with The Spanish Review, Borges discussed his feelings about his hometown and country of Cuba, revealing he \"felt no need to disguise the bitterness of my heart, for every day, in every street, there was the knowledge that a person, who at least was not a person of the past, was being lynched.

{"id":1990,"ended":false,"length":577,"gen_text":"The closely related species Verpa conica typically has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight @ - @ spored asci. Other features typical of Verpa conica include pale yellow warts, sometimes referred to as ipsicolous warts, on the upper surfaces of the cap, and a white spot at the center of the cap.

V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight spored asci. Other features typical of include pale yellow warts, sometimes referred to as ipsicolous warts, on the upper surfaces of the cap, and a white spot at the center of the cap. The color of those spots is often variable due to interspore dispersal and is often light to dark brown in color. Several subspecies are known to hybridize sporadically, which has led to the classification of subspecies as separate genera in several taxonomic groups.\n\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\n\n[ citation needed ] The last member of the American Opuntia (A. caespitosa) tree family, Verpa conica has been found in most (if not all) of the northern parts of North America. At the lower elevations the range ranges are smaller; at the highest elevations there is no evidence of a range at all due to elevation limits as high as 5,000', although these are known to occur in Alaska at elevations of 7,900'.\n\n[ citation necessary ] In southern Florida, the plant is known from a few scattered locations in Pembroke and Lee counties. One is present on the island of Palm Beach in Miami-Dade County. It is also known from the vicinity of Lido Key and Sarasota County\n\n[ citation needed ] In the eastern states, the plant is commonly found in parks with streams. In the southern states, the species has been recorded near places where lakes are used for recreation.\n\nEtymology [ edit ]\n\nVerpa conica is of Basque origin; it can be translated as \"carp\" (from the Latin carpus ). The second part of the name is cognate to the Spanish word \"carpillo\", which has the same meaning.\n\nGeographic distribution and habitat [ edit ]\n\nInhabiting the northern half of North America, the plant appears to prefer high elevations in the contiguous United States and Canada.\n\nInvasive potential [ edit ]\n\n[ citation needed ] However, it appears that the species has only recently been introduced into the United States, and is thus subject to the conservation and management action of the US Department of Agriculture.\n\n[4] During the 1920s, the original source of the species

{"id":3731,"ended":true,"length":607,"gen_text":"When she was captured by the Germans, Premuda's new guns had not been completed. Their initial plans called for the ship to serve as a radar picket for night fighters, with the aim of capturing aircraft in the Atlantic to provide accurate intelligence. During the initial bombardment of Brest she was hit by three German bombs, although she was not actually sunk. She was towed into a port, and later repaired on the French shore using salvaged materials.\n\nShe returned to the United Kingdom during the early 1940s, and on 20th November 1943, she was again sunk by torpedo, this time in the Bristol Channel, off the coast of Cornwall. (For more details see World War II: Torpedoes on Ships.) It was only the second time a British battleship had been sunk in any period of time by torpedo. As a result of the Battle of Brest, in early December 1943, the French government ordered the refit and repair of the ship, and the ship rejoined the war on 8th February 1944, sailing under the command of Captain Robert S. Parker.\n\nAt 14,570 tons displacement, she was not a great gun platform and when she was attacked by the German aircraft carrier Erebus on 26 August 1943 she had only 4 machine guns ( 2 on the deck ), leaving only one forward deck battery, which was also the ship's only self-defense weapon.\n\nOn 13th October she was again sunk by two torpedoes, leaving only the superstructure on fire and no survivors (She had suffered 1,350 casualties during the Brest Battle). On 31st October, she was rammed by a submarine and sank within 30 seconds. During the sinking she was attacked by a German U-boat crew, who also attempted to land on her deck, but were prevented at the last moment by a destroyer escort. She was towed into Le Havre, France, and eventually moved to Gibraltar.\n\nCommodore Parker later described the Erebus as \"a very interesting ship, with great potential but she's so ugly with lots of holes that I couldn't even get past the side of her. I think she had some hidden weapons that needed to be loaded.. \". She made three sorties, the last one on 8th November 1944, which was as part of the British Fleet off the coast of North Africa.\n\nFollowing several raids on Gibraltar by the Germans she was bombed by a B-17 Superfortress over the end of November 1944. On the 24th December 1944, she was attacked with torpedoes by a destroyer, sinking in a matter of moments, however, the destroyer survived and then returned to her home harbour in Singapore. Captain Parker and the crew were evacuated to Singapore with other casualties. The Erebus was subsequently scuttled by explosion, but her wreckage remains off the western tip of Gibraltar, on the point north of the mouth of the Red Sea.\n\nHer wreck lies off Fortis Marina, on

{"id":979,"ended":false,"length":611,"gen_text":"Federer has a contract with Nike footwear and apparel. For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships won by Federer. He wore the jacket at the first two tournaments of the 2006 season -- Wimbledon and the U.S. Open -- and has worn it at the first stage of the two tournaments since.\n\nOlympic history\n\nFederer has competed in all 18 Olympic Games. He received a bronze medal in the finals of Sydney 2000 and a silver at Athens 2004. He won gold at the Sydney Games in 2000 after being seeded 10th. In 2008, he lost in the first round to Nikolay Davydenko for bronze in Beijing.\n\nFederer was twice awarded Australia's best player award, in 2007 and 2010, a recognition that has been withdrawn in 2008. Federer won the Australian Player of the Year award in 2004 and 2008. His best singles results and overall ranking were ranked No. 8, No. 7 and No. 7 at Australian championships. He finished second during the 2006 Australian Open season in singles. He was runner-up in 2008 and 2009 to Novak Djokovic.\n\nFederer won the 1999 American Open, when he was No. 2 in the world.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn November, 2000, Federer became the only man to win the five Grand Slam titles in four years. He was also the only man to win the four French Open titles of 2004, 2006 and 2008. Federer remains the highest ranked player in the world -- a tie with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic -- and the only player to complete 17 Grand Slam singles, 15 Australian Open singles and 21 French Open singles. Federer is also the only man playing on at least his 18th Grand Slam event, a record unmatched by Novak Djokovic and Jimmy Connors. Federer's career Grand Slam singles ranking was No. 6 in 2016. He was No. 3 in 2006. His career Grand Slam events ranked No. 20, 21, 17, 16, 18, 19, 17, 13, 17, 12, 21, 21, 20, 16, 16, 18, 16, 20, 18, 8, 9, 16, 20, 15, 11, 17, 8, 7, 22, and 15.\n\nFederer also reached at least the final of a Grand Slam tournament in 20 of his 22 career Grand Slam finals, five more than any other player. Federer is tied for the eighth most Grand Slam tournament titles (18) of any player in the top 10. He is second only to John McEnroe (22), who has more titles than any other player.

{"id":4256,"ended":true,"length":605,"gen_text":"Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, lung tissue exposure has been shown to be similar to or higher than that of workers exposed to asbestos in other industrial settings. More research is needed to determine the true health effects of asbestos exposure in the workplace.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that smoking among women aged 18 and over is the strongest risk factor for asbestos disease and that smoking cigarettes or cigars is the predominant tobacco use among women. In the United States, smoking rates have been decreasing. The CDC has further noted that exposure to asbestos fibers can have adverse effects on health for years after exposure to the material.\n\nSmoking cessation programs include menthol cigarettes because menthol has long been used as a smoke-screening substance in tobacco products. It has little or no effect on the health risks from the nicotine, and the long-term effects of menthol cigarettes on lung cancer risk are unknown. Other tobacco options have been proven less effective.\n\nSmoking kills more than 2 million Americans each year, many of them smokers who become victims of third-hand smoke exposure from caregivers. Smoking has been shown to have significant negative effects on pulmonary function, the ability to breathe. Additionally, research has revealed that most smokers who are diagnosed with lung cancer are not current users of tobacco.\n\nAbout the American Lung Association\n\nThe American Lung Association is dedicated to the mission of saving lives through prevention. We unite more than 15 million American families through three distinct programs: Lung Cancer Action, Lung Disease Awareness, and Smokefree By 2050. As a member benefit of The Coca-Cola Company Foundation, Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights and the American Heart Association, we commit to a vision of a healthy, vibrant, healthy America. For more information on our programs, go to www.lung.org or call 1-800-LUNG. Lung Cancer Action The American Lung Association is the nation's premier source of lung health information, providing free access to information on nearly 1,800 medical terms; over 90 medical studies; more than one million smoking-related documents; and many thousands of health and medical documents. Lung Cancer Action also works to educate patients, physicians and health advocates about the cancer-prevention messages of the American Lung Association. Lung Disease Awareness Lung disease is the primary cause of chronic disease and death in the United States. The American Lung Association works tirelessly to educate Americans about the importance of lung, heart and respiratory health. Lung Disease Awareness Month runs September to November. The American Lung Association is dedicated to making this nation smoke free. Learn more about how you can help by visiting www.lung.org. Smokefree By 2050 Smokefree 2020, a collaborative initiative by the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society, is an effort to move the nation toward a smoke-free society.

{"id":2129,"ended":false,"length":603,"gen_text":"In Saint Antonius of Padua ( Der Heilige Antonius von Padua ) Busch challenges Catholic belief. It was released by the publisher Moritz Schauenburg at the time Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of Humanae Vitae in the year 1858.[4] The work was originally published in Italian in 1865. In the English translation, Busch has provided extensive commentary to assist the reader.[5][6] An English translation was published in 1882. According to Busch, his goal was to make the Catholic doctrine more understandable, and to help laypeople better understand Catholic doctrine.[7] The Roman Catholic Church has tried to censor him since the 1950s with threats of excommunication.[8][9] The Roman Catholic Church accuses him of \"heresy\". In a letter dated the 5 August 2016, Cardinal Carlo Caffarra asked Bishop Mark Davies of Canterbury to withdraw Busch's invitation to attend the 2017 Eucharistic Congress, which will be held in Canterbury, England. [1] On the same day, Busch wrote a letter addressed to Pope Francis who denied the existence of God. According to the author, Pope Francis, \"cannot know the things which I say\".[2] The pope said that the author's writings are \"a blasphemy from your book\" (in Portuguese), [3] while adding that Busch's \"foolish\" writings can only lead people to \"evil\"[10] (that is, to atheism). On 6 August 2016 Busch wrote a letter to Pope Francis which had a clear explanation in detail. In this letter the author acknowledges that he has made errors in his teaching, and to which Pope Francis replied, \"It would be an eternal sin to permit such mistakes, and I can only tell you that I would be so kind as to pray that God would forgive you my sins; and I am in the very same position\".[3][11] The same day, the Catholic newspaper La Sexta published a column by the author, who said that Pope Francis was trying to \"tarnish\" Busch's image.[12] Pope Francis wrote back to the author, \"I trust in the Lord; and, what I know of your faith, I forgive you\".

{"id":2406,"ended":true,"length":651,"gen_text":"Accommodation is the process by which the eye increases optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long @ - @ standing medical consensus is that accommodation is the most critical of the three major eye movements (the other two being refraction and focus).\n\n\nWhen I read this and looked it up, I realized how difficult it is to actually know what the definition is. It is not really clear to me or many other professionals. If anyone can provide a definition for this, it would be much appreciated.\n\n\nHere is the link to the relevant section in the Oxford English Dictionary\n\n\nHere is the definition of accommodation:\n\nAdequate, sufficient, sufficiently: a large enough boat to handle our boat loads. A term of respect, especially one of high estimation. The condition of being able to adapt to another's view and keep the eyes aligned with the head without undue strain. The change required to accommodate for the change in field of view. As, to change an object's proportion and size to one's own, so to adapt the eye so it can keep itself in one place while keeping the image in another. A term for moving towards something.\n\n\nAnother one I came across was this from:\n\nAdaptation: a process of the mind to give the eye some adjustment to its natural position so as to allow the image presented to it to be clearly presented.\n\nAnd the reference I used for both of these is:\n\nDictionary of Scientific Biomedical English\n\nAn accommodative adaptation is a change involving accommodation which alters the angle of the pupil to the environment at which the eye is fixed. It is a temporary condition which is, therefore, reversible by a process known as accommodation. When the eye changes this angle, it moves at reduced speed; the amount of accommodation is a function of the amount of change that occurred in the position of the eye relative to the environment. The natural position of an eyesight (optic axis) is set out in terms of the angles of the two eyes. In general, accommodation is related to the length of the optical axis (optical distance, l), which is the angle subtended by the optic vane (an element that covers the optic nerve). Accommodation is the change in angle of the eye as viewed by the brain. This is the only accommodation in the eye that can be changed independently of the amount of the image being accommodated; its length is the optic axis minus the angle of accommodation. As a result, with accommodation, the image is maintained at a new optical level, in the same field of view, by the same amount of accommodation as that with which the image was accommodated, but without the need for the eye to compensate for it.\n\n\nHere is the link to the relevant section in the DSBME\n\n\nMy question is this: \"If someone told you that everyone was \"equally adapted\", how does that relate to our definition of \"equal\"? It is clearly not a definition I can be sure of, since no one has defined it in an objective sense of equal.

{"id":2934,"ended":true,"length":672,"gen_text":"The genome size, and the number of genes it encodes varies widely between organisms. The smallest genomes occur in viruses ( which can have as few as 2 protein @ - @ coding sequences ), and the smallest are found in nematodes, which can have as few as 20 coding sequences. These extremely small genomes also allow scientists to trace the evolutionary history of the gene, allowing a detailed description of the gene's function and history. The genomes of viruses and protozoans and higher animals have also been sequenced in detail and are often much less than 100 bp in length. The vast amounts of data that are now available have changed the way biologists look at the universe of genes and the processes that determine their function. For instance, geneticists are now studying small differences such as the number of repeats in a gene to see how these genes function, and the fact that a particular group of genes is more active when compared with other genes can provide insights into how the genes are linked and how they can be regulated. It can also help in understanding how genes change under certain conditions, such as when they are being copied.\n\nThe discovery of the human genome was also accompanied by the description of the first protein coding DNA. These first proteins were of type I and were of small size. Most humans lack the gene for this gene because the corresponding DNA sequences do not code for the necessary protein. Scientists now know that these sequences do encode several proteins, so these genes are not essential and are no longer found in the human genome.\n\nIn the latest discovery, scientists have found two novel genes, one of which is a protein, which were previously discovered by using different methods and technology. It has also been described how the sequence, and consequently the structure, of the virus was determined using a completely different method from previous methods. This information is a key element in the understanding of what the structure of the protein could be like and provides hints at how it might behave.\n\nThese two genes have now been found by studying viruses that infect other species, and it is believed that these two new genes are the first of their kind found in a virus. Other scientists have also used this information to suggest that other genes could be found in the large genomes of many organisms, especially since they make up most of the genes in the human genome. However, some scientists are not happy with the discovery and continue to claim that the virus should be removed from the list of being on the human species.\n\nIn the latest discovery, scientists have described how the DNA of the virus was determined using a completely different method from earlier methods. It has also been described how the sequence of the virus was determined using a completely different method from earlier methods. This information is important in understanding how the virus might be able to infect a different species. Other scientists are not happy with the discovery and continue to claim that the virus should be removed from the list of being on the human species. Scientists are also sceptical of how the virus was discovered in the first place and question how it could have evolved to start in the virus by chance.\n\nThe scientists have also used this information to suggest that other genes could be found in the large genomes (including humans), especially since they make up most of the genes in the human genome. However, most scientists do not believe that these gene structures would be suitable for infecting another species, although it has also not been excluded.","token_len":690,"entropy":[10.9046,6.7154,4.0603,4.0076,2.0581,1.9025,0.0584,1.1689,3.9955,2.4335,0.0025,6.9726,2.5859,1.6656,2.1001,0.6902,2.0991,3.0766,2.3284,6.9357,0.131,4.3874,2.9165,10.3372,3.0383,1.9087,1.8108,0.3036,0.0025,3.1914,6.0101,17.2576,6.3132,12.2082,4.9622,1.7945,2.9199,0.9262,0.9376,2.8445,4.713,1.8746,0.058,5.5412,0.0017,0.1401,1.9326,1.2816,1.9427,0.1772,0.7591,0.527,0.0059,3.0251,2.7786,0.4788,0.9174,4.4463,5.3911,0.334,0.0927,4.1763,3.7674,4.0068,0.0373,5.619,0.8604,1.2199,0.7286,0.0714,1.8085,4.2508,1.9777,3.7724,3.7619,2.5767,4.1318,0.0387,1.0265,2.0649,0.4724,1.1639,1.4208,3.8823,0.4417,2.3467,3.5285,0.3646,3.3325,1.1327,4.3333,1.6746,0.0042,5.534,5.6684,2.3031,2.4029,2.7807,0.2746,0.8592,0.0006,3.2592,2.9278,2.8218,1.8399,3.113,3.7737,4.441,0.846,2.874,4.9917,0.0095,0.4871,0.4882,0.3941,2.1627,5.4932,6.4342,0.0077,1.0108,2.0713,1.5618,2.5461,0.2334,2.6461,4.7442,0.48,0.5517,2.2909,3.0653,0.0802,1.1392,5.2605,0.7109,3.3051,1.428,1.8422,4.3448,0.509,4.9768,1.0787,0.5825,0.3805,3.4671,2.2057,0.0524,4.9046,1.1581,2.1614,0.8904,3.6631,5.9751,4.8397,5.8639,0.003,1.4847,1.759,0.1177,2.0158,0.7485,0.7125,0.1859,2.0651,2.5676,1.0889,1.8672,3.2037,2.3704,2.4444,0.899,2.7254,4.5648,0.0141,2.2279,2.6242,6.251,0.0469,0.3072,1.6646,2.0534,1.9069,3.5842,1.3946,1.4916,1.1518,1.6181,3.6165,2.944,3.0509,0.1384,1.2684,1.4064,1.4266,1.2844,3.5097,3.1882,1.5382,0.4472,4.0944,1.0263,1.7254,0.3526,4.3854,3.8339,0.3384,1.8562,3.4017,1.3453,1.074,1.651,3.191,4.9063,4.0655,0.939,1.2183,1.1032,0.0059,1.6597,2.368,0.3502,3.2333,2.2322,2.0636,1.7525,0.0833,1.961,4.6799,0.1476,0.9459,2.5458,0.1259,2.73,4.2752,4.7627,0.0287,0.7776,6.3619,0.0499,0.8513,2.1168,4.3317,2.2157,3.9087,1.9809,4.2613,2.7517,1.907,0.6078,4.5334,5.673,0.6399,2.3539,1.4834,4.2339,4.6508,0.4448,1.4525,5.1459,5.9875,4.0595,1.2365,2.5923,0.6892,1.5811,3.1143,4.4925,2.2251,5.7318,2.6627,2.4515,3.2657,0.0015,1.6195,0.0448,1.9307,3.0316,1.441,0.3658,4.7735,2.5191,0.7563,0.1494,2.9518,4.2784,3.4355,2.9201,4.786,0.8669,0.9595,4.0411,3.2543,1.773,1.0959,2.6966,2.2966,3.2559,1.9588,2.8316,0.0095,4.9689,0.0694,2.2878,0.3829,0.1594,0.0871,1.2876,0.0002,3.1002,1.6416,5.6835,3.3997,0.4191,1.3808,1.0398,1.7519,3.9664,5.5282,1.0841,1.9974,2.2851,1.2806,0.0601,1.6406,2.3182,2.4136,3.4555,1.7636,4.2621,1.7989,5.0705,1.7286,4.2456,3.4623,1.0909,2.5147,4.1488,0.3051,4.1715,2.3214,3.1012,0.1083,4.4136,1.8635,1.1642,4.1355,5.1594,2.7706,4.727,0.3349,4.0868,0.813,0.5861,1.0204,6.6261,3.2938,1.9088,2.3293,1.5141,5.6702,0.2768,1.0068,2.9796,3.0469,2.0166,0.4989,1.7554,5.1109,1.9224,3.8513,3.4647,3.7384,0.4597,0.9821,1.3698,0.0628,4.5814,2.1301,5.4337,0.3516,0.5039,4.9921,5.33,0.6374,2.3882,1.9483,5.0622,6.6994,2.8329,0.9829,1.3889,1.601,3.9753,0.8813,0.8299,0.0002,4.3836,1.8103,1.5275,2.4185,2.3645,0.0504,3.4512,3.2927,4.0576,3.2954,1.3807,0.5485,4.0282,1.7066,1.2246,1.3484,2.6765,0.8243,2.5609,0.171,1.8749,1.7879,2.8783,0.3341,1.7966,2.4736,1.2018,1.6961,0.3665,0.069,2.1138,0.3247,1.6873,0.8753,0.2877,5.1921,2.2302,1.1266,1.6349,3.7664,1.7297,2.8039,0.1679,4.9534,0.5299,2.4469,3.3321,2.2457,0.5916,0.6353,0.1993,2.7666,6.2265,3.0515,0.1787,3.2338,3.5079,1.248,5.3499,4.3448,2.1408,6.1597,0.3406,3.7962,0.1977,0.2166,2.2681,0.7464,0.9641,0.8408,0.0712,0.145,4.5199,0.0825,4.2727,0.8112,1.603,1.9792,4.6921,0.4061,0.9114,1.5162,2.1198,6.0091,0.0149,2.9395,0.1332,0.8981,1.8209,4.6071,1.6408,4.663,0.1797,0.1778,1.1399,0.1514,6.6002,5.3256,0.1753,0.3699,4.5166,0.6119,0.6872,0.0002,3.4076,1.7867,2.9485,1.3112,0.2045,1.2066,0.9782,5.1755,0.609,0.5369,3.5708,1.4039,0.5327,0.3346,0.4878,1.0474,0.6815,0.3057,0.4946,0.0302,0.0861,0.252,5.0772,0.0604,0.2868,2.5529,0.9749,0.1364,0.0108,0.1048,0.0085,0.0391,0.2334,2.3953,0.0574,0.0619,0.0558,0.0214,0.0599,0.1114,0.3574,0.0167,0.0298,0.153,0.6574,0.0051,0.0661,0.222,0.0464,0.028,4.1032,0.7619,0.9142,0.6471,0.2784,0.4874,2.4282,1.9822,2.4812,0.0036,2.0403,2.6924,1.6786,0.1938,1.1411,4.5831,0.0704,0.7136,0.5594,0.042,0.0285,0.0738,0.0356,0.2123,0.0992,0.0033,0.0175,0.0105,0.039,0.0174,0.038,0.0432,0.016,0.0113,0.0085,0.0272,0.0111,0.01,0.004,0.0012,0.0022,0.005,0.0789,4.7344,1.5801,1.486,5.3953,0.0027,1.3055,3.1931,1.1968,0.7152,1.6375,1.7175,2.4205,0.0777,0.0416,0.0038,2.2399,3.9795,1.8217,1.466,0.9882,0.5221,4.2468,2.2579,5.0763,5.2927,1.0031,3.8087,6.3522,1.1575,0.327,0.7035,0.0002,1.7913,3.7496,2.0594,1.2191,2.8339,1.0585,0.2951,0.0461,0.094,0.0323,0.1494,0.0363,0.1257,0.0171,0.0038,0.0054,0.0212,0.0838,0.0272,8.8005,3.9375,1.4873,2.6629,1.1503,0.0115,0.0542,0.0166,0.0055,0.0389,0.0123,0.0035,0.0062,0.0229,0.0117,0.0292,0.011,0.0495,0.2771,0.0267,4.7779,0.1255,2.2731,0.0353,1.077,0.3388,1.3364,5.3234,4.6024,2.3558,0.7679,3.7041,0.2731,4.9913,0.0017,2.1716,0.1343,1.4612,3.3879,2.052,2.6417,3.124,3.5544,0.0718,3.716,0.7046]}
{"id":4191,"ended":true,"length":646,"gen_text":"Fossett was one of the world's most accomplished sailors. Speed sailing was his specialty and from 1993 to 2004 he dominated the record sheets, setting 23 official world records and nine distance records. At one point in the year 2000 he set the world record for the most consecutive days in open water speed sailing with 13. On 26 September 1999 he set the record in the time it took to go from London to New York, setting the original record was 20 days.\n\nThe author is the son of a well-respected and acclaimed academic, and has spent his life trying to give back to society and make new people smarter. As a member of the British National Maritime Museum who has written a scientific and scientific oriented book on the history of seafaring, he has been involved in the development of new technologies for use on oceanic research vessels and a number of innovative educational applications to the community. His career as an academic was also an experience of developing ideas that had the potential to lead to new technology and applications. As part of his research in sailing he also has taken up studying the oceanographic data of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and in 1997 he went to the South Atlantic for four months on a charter to study the interplay of wind and currents.\n\nHe completed his PhD studies at the Department of Physics at the University of California, which was set up in 1970. He had then moved into the School of Oceanography at Cambridge University, where his research focuses on wind, wave, and ocean circulation and on how climate and climate change affects wind and ocean currents. He has recently undertaken a project entitled Ocean Circulation and Climate Research at Cape Agulhas, in the south-east Atlantic - investigating how changes in wind patterns play a role in variability of ocean circulation. This has led him to work at the International Research Center for Oceans, a joint research centre established by the University of Amsterdam and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. At this centre he has led large scale multi-disciplinary research programmes on the oceanic circulation. His research is also focused on the interaction of the winds and currents with the upper ocean and Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHe has taught at the University of Maryland and the University of the Basque Country in Catalonia, Spain. In 1994-1995 he also taught at the Institute of Water Resource Management at the University of Texas, Austin and he has been lecturing at University College London and the University of London on the subject of sailing and oceanic current science. He has also taught in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Israel.\n\nHe is now an Ambassador for the British Council in France, who has sponsored his research. His work has inspired him to set up the Nautical Centre, a group of experts whose role is to promote the study of the oceans, particularly marine conservation, in France, by providing expert advice and leading research teams on marine environmental policy, ocean currents and wind-climate-water interaction. He also works with the World Heritage Institute to research and promote the conservation of mangrove forests in the Mediterranean. His research is funded primarily by government agencies such as the National Oceanography Centre, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, the University of Cambridge, the American

{"id":3481,"ended":false,"length":630,"gen_text":"Unicamp is generally regarded by the Brazilian population as Brazil's Area 51, with the government running a secret underground area purportedly called Pavilion 18, located under the Institute of Chemistry. In recent years, the government has begun to publicize the location of the actual facility, claiming that it is under heavy construction and would open in 2019.\n\nWhile the Brazilian government currently denies the existence of the facility, other Brazilians have expressed their disbelief. According to some researchers, Brazil's Area 51 may have been designed in conjunction with the CIA, and operated under a secret MKULTRA project, and the facility was actually built after being abandoned by the American military (for unknown reasons) and the US Military Industrial Complex (for unknown reasons). A recent study by a researcher claiming to be a former military intelligence officer is supported by circumstantial evidence found in former military archive records in the US and other places, some of which have been independently verified. The new evidence suggests that, while the US government shut down the Area 51 facility early in the last century, the Brazilian military had been involved in some form of secret construction work inside the facility. Also, while Brazilian military bases in the 1980's were operated by the State Reserve of Military of Brazil (FMBR), military bases have never been closed by Brazilian President Fernando Hierro, even after various investigations, including those which turned up evidence of drug trafficking by former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\n\nIn 2015, two former Brazilian government officials (and members of several intelligence agencies) claimed that the Brazilian government was involved in at least six top secret secret projects which involve the CIA, the Brazilian military and various groups, such as the Brazilian Institute for Advanced Research (IBAMA) and the Brazilian Intelligence Service (SICAD), and their respective affiliated entities, such as Iberdrola, Conexant S.A., Aeroportos Brasileiro, Beleta Brasil SA, Beletra A\u00e7\u00e3o SA, Bombardier Inc. and Rio Tinto (among others).\n\nThe most important aspect of this activity is that for decades, Brazil has been providing the Brazilian military with various technologies that are being used in covert operations, the most publicized of which being the BAE System's (now BAE Systems) Javelin II missiles. Brazil is one of the largest exporters of modern military equipment to the United States. While the United States, on the one hand, is known to be developing many new stealth technologies over the course of the 21 st century, with new, advanced aircraft carriers, submarines, new high tech missile systems, etc., the Brazilian military receives weapons designed and produced in secret by American corporations and military units, while the Brazilian government continues to support and export the same technologies.\n\nThe Brazilian government, in particular, is also believed to be heavily involved in the transportation of drugs into the United States\n\nAlso, according to one researcher, Brazil's military, including its intelligence service, and various organizations are complicit in the transport of drugs into the United States, primarily through Colombia.\n\nHowever, for

{"id":3211,"ended":true,"length":676,"gen_text":"The novel examines the nature versus nurture debate in detail. At the beginning of the novel, Cal writes, `` Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifth finger,'' and says that in the year since she learned of the mutation, she has had five people ask her if she would like copies of her DNA to identify their own mutations in their genes.\n\nThis could be done quickly with easy-to-use tests, or could take time and patience. The book also is designed to make the reader interested in medical science and genetics. This can give the reader a feeling for how genetics works behind the scenes, and how the various types of DNA can affect the development and function of organisms. For instance, genetic effects are most clearly demonstrated with respect to human disease: If you have a disease, it's important to know more about what causes it, how genes come into play, and how we can counteract its influence. This is the opposite of the ``what causes what'' paradigm that is so well illustrated in the film and the television show.\n\nThe novel has the feel of a novel in a textbook, with chapter titles and a table of contents, and the chapters are in a sequential format like chapters of a book. The chapters are written from very different perspectives--that of the scientist, through the characters in her lab, which includes two students, Sam and Lidia--and the perspective is presented throughout the story. Sam lives in an apartment complex with his parents and brother; Lidia lives at home with her father. They have never met as children, and she's a self-proclaimed ``geek.'' In Sam's book he is doing research for his undergraduate bioengineering class, which is a combination of biology, chemistry, chemistry, and physics. In this part of his work at UMD, Sam has been in the lab for two weeks studying how different types of cells sense light. He's finding that some cells respond to sunlight under certain conditions, and some will not respond at all--they're ``non-shadows.'' If these cells are given a drug, they can respond more efficiently. Other cells have a different response, which makes them ``shadows.'' Under certain circumstances the drug can increase the responsiveness of a cell to light, so that they become even more responsive, and this is seen as a major advance.\n\nOther characters in the story have also had different lab experiences. One of them has been in the lab for only a few days, but Sam notices that her DNA has changed. She knows that this has happened as a result of a new drug that she's been given, but she isn't sure what her lab partner is doing with her DNA and whether she can detect genetic differences with it. One section deals with a very particular type of kidney disease, and another has to do with genetic susceptibility to malaria.\n\nThe final chapter deals with the effects of her knowledge on Sam's parents. The idea is that her learning could make them worry about passing on her genes, and they worry about the possibility of having children, even though she says they have an inbuilt safety mechanism. It's interesting to have Sam's parents worry (as Sam's mother does), but the story's most interesting effect is that it gives readers of the book a broader awareness of how genetics affects us, and why it might not be to our advantage to focus on one side of the story when discussing genetics.","token_len":696,"entropy":[8.7143,7.0567,0.6524,4.7939,8.7759,0.0896,0.448,1.6446,4.9008,1.4103,4.9428,0.7836,2.4883,0.1731,0.1256,0.9748,0.174,7.5973,7.6779,2.5618,8.4383,17.3318,9.5671,0.9453,4.0513,3.5962,0.5559,2.2375,1.2545,12.139,1.9159,6.5193,5.4336,2.36,8.0602,1.9032,4.8663,1.2127,5.8937,1.0821,4.6482,1.4664,4.4644,3.1223,2.9057,3.3067,0.9171,0.7849,0.7985,0.3908,0.7405,0.3205,2.8485,4.5301,5.5096,2.4141,0.4112,1.8533,0.7317,4.0613,0.8783,8.1834,0.1086,0.9261,3.3121,2.5732,4.6939,2.2074,0.7084,1.9697,4.5838,2.5666,2.9243,0.136,3.2711,0.0031,4.4667,6.0918,0.7252,5.045,5.8665,2.2993,6.3574,1.911,0.0133,0.001,1.0865,3.3503,1.3092,4.0976,4.1182,1.7432,4.462,1.6729,3.6528,0.8852,2.1542,2.6751,2.3904,5.6996,5.9215,0.2977,3.3639,1.4393,0.2111,4.0999,0.1073,5.4651,2.6662,1.2556,1.4541,0.8589,4.1,3.8862,5.5824,0.7799,0.2853,0.8737,3.9599,2.5885,1.6578,3.5998,1.3842,7.0032,0.0824,0.0314,1.3078,0.8602,1.4317,2.2973,4.4489,4.2504,0.0215,2.9321,2.3977,2.4427,1.7959,2.7039,2.3824,1.1459,0.0031,4.2308,0.2347,3.74,2.0312,0.0167,5.1595,5.4294,2.3224,4.5292,4.3469,2.6548,2.7157,3.174,0.0021,3.5675,2.3304,3.7604,5.2491,1.8387,0.7884,0.5956,2.2067,0.9034,2.5051,2.3096,3.9239,0.2224,0.6166,6.2682,0.0579,2.3774,1.2537,0.5871,1.1859,1.6508,5.2829,5.5976,1.418,0.3019,0.284,0.1782,0.5993,3.4408,0.3742,5.4473,4.043,4.4705,0.2285,2.854,1.0645,2.2041,5.8869,0.1784,1.2196,2.8092,4.9235,3.1864,4.9044,0.0783,4.6031,1.5839,1.7137,2.0484,5.1245,3.7834,0.2335,0.9931,3.0456,3.749,2.5628,2.3775,1.8076,0.5937,0.6134,0.0002,1.4026,2.8356,3.1842,3.6439,2.909,0.0565,0.4331,4.3365,2.3969,1.9749,4.811,0.9575,1.6582,4.8467,2.1979,1.4287,2.7296,4.7122,0.0379,0.0417,1.8125,1.1955,2.255,2.9719,0.5586,4.576,2.2402,3.5959,2.4002,5.8112,1.9522,1.2734,0.1502,1.4696,0.2136,1.2629,1.9026,0.8364,2.6708,3.0273,7.2652,1.0711,0.7163,3.0152,3.4775,0.4946,1.0453,2.6705,0.6468,7.2477,1.2332,5.8029,3.16,2.2959,3.7131,0.4276,6.3656,2.1531,4.353,3.3558,1.3464,6.9352,0.4167,5.0667,5.4563,2.9212,0.5902,1.5743,3.9387,1.3362,3.8025,5.187,0.3569,2.6316,0.4054,4.1648,6.164,0.7229,2.7706,0.877,1.9595,1.7639,1.1665,1.6095,0.9704,2.7251,2.7093,0.9742,0.0002,0.8158,3.8655,0.3515,0.3268,0.1096,2.8411,1.7887,2.7058,1.9772,4.8642,0.6966,5.4774,2.3083,0.5784,1.4568,2.9743,3.4621,2.7508,5.7376,0.009,2.0781,2.5376,4.5749,0.0273,0.8034,3.8767,3.1844,0.0444,5.5439,3.5294,2.9497,5.4897,1.5113,2.5554,0.9706,4.5131,6.7388,0.8114,0.7718,0.8644,2.2646,1.0436,3.0503,4.355,0.1392,1.267,1.3215,0.6076,0.1913,4.8123,0.8618,0.6529,1.0403,0.4159,2.6718,4.3189,4.8421,0.0222,2.1716,3.5237,5.7367,5.047,3.1487,0.2296,1.2908,2.3529,2.2027,5.4523,1.1857,0.8088,1.8036,2.6372,1.9986,3.6705,2.131,3.8888,1.9512,0.0053,2.4967,6.0508,1.9983,1.0873,1.6434,1.8648,5.2049,0.6858,2.1646,0.5476,2.8346,0.5695,4.7735,7.0173,0.5821,0.3015,0.5382,0.7755,2.5312,6.711,0.9293,1.5253,1.1661,0.0033,4.0525,2.7007,2.0899,1.9417,3.2314,0.6707,3.923,3.4179,0.3047,4.6805,3.8265,0.2895,0.619,5.4164,1.0789,2.5391,1.4657,0.7315,2.5105,2.2753,3.2923,2.9069,1.3266,5.2537,0.3543,3.2194,1.419,1.4408,0.4938,1.2634,2.4783,3.0305,0.2637,1.2487,0.1281,0.0298,0.299,4.7705,1.8218,1.8163,3.1602,1.1828,1.1178,3.5903,0.4936,3.6195,0.2115,3.2328,0.9233,1.2707,1.0569,0.9439,3.3359,1.0522,3.3397,2.892,6.7822,0.2479,1.2212,2.2952,1.0169,2.8551,1.2275,4.9526,0.3718,0.6257,3.8171,1.3251,1.5623,1.0339,0.0003,4.6897,2.1477,1.0571,0.4265,0.9908,2.4794,4.2993,2.557,2.957,5.5486,0.1657,0.7021,2.423,1.4342,1.1877,2.9465,1.0477,1.31,0.2883,0.1299,0.3048,2.6192,0.6687,0.502,0.774,0.4323,1.2235,3.3029,3.9111,0.4415,3.0327,4.0854,1.9314,1.7253,1.2874,1.4897,4.4706,0.8803,2.3828,3.1097,1.8816,4.3399,0.2333,0.1376,0.0027,2.0202,3.1861,0.9328,1.2655,1.1304,1.2155,0.5141,0.5274,0.9772,0.996,0.5541,4.1887,0.0006,0.3069,1.3442,4.0139,5.7736,2.4384,1.3939,0.6341,1.7306,1.1301,0.607,4.5263,2.6556,1.5772,2.5417,5.7921,5.6667,2.3026,2.9434,3.2018,0.1364,3.8839,6.9125,3.6622,0.055,2.12,4.9275,5.6777,0.9902,0.0011,5.7533,0.6351,0.916,1.3213,2.0124,3.536,0.9944,0.0083,0.0091,4.2168,5.2009,0.1599,4.4406,0.3135,1.3712,0.0002,1.081,5.2918,1.137,2.3245,0.0494,1.2493,3.1246,0.0884,4.7762,5.5541,1.4932,1.7421,0.7398,2.8328,0.8206,2.9924,5.3231,0.6899,0.2146,3.3073,6.1604,3.6545,2.9182,0.7364,4.5581,0.8789,6.529,0.5666,1.3489,2.3471,1.2938,1.0481,2.2197,2.9441,0.6603,3.1659,2.0382,0.8907,2.6496,1.6994,3.7785,3.2492,0.3591,3.3782,2.9591,2.1802,2.1935,4.9456,4.5634,3.79,3.7582,1.8212,1.3458,3.7031,0.8477,3.107,0.5917,5.1347,2.0823,0.7317,0.287,2.4208,7.4436,2.6887,2.0603,1.3754,2.0182,0.5867,1.4209,1.2462,2.1598,3.4146,4.2035,4.444,1.1438,3.7908,0.437,1.2389,0.8069,2.9248,3.0465,4.9548,0.5285,0.4256,0.9411,6.2426,4.3207,0.0654,1.829,1.8917,1.5212,3.0495,2.1864,0.6064,3.4802,1.3998,3.3346,3.3849,0.2695,6.4755,0.3135,0.5196,0.3238,4.7739,0.5591,3.3621,4.0669,0.2385,0.2167,3.1511,4.6329,4.585,1.4669,0.2323]}
{"id":4609,"ended":true,"length":634,"gen_text":"In June 1949, while Rowell was acting Chief of the General Staff, the country was rocked by the 1949 Australian coal strike. The strike began when stocks of coal were already low and would continue for over a month. The action was ultimately put down by the courts; in 1950 the National Council for the Welfare of Prisoners was created to mediate the dispute between the Government and the union. An early sign of Rowell's personal style was his insistence that all his staff and visitors wear grey.\n\nHe quickly rose through the ranks of the Army, eventually becoming Colonel-General, and became the new Chief of the Army. The first new weapons systems were developed under his leadership. In 1961 he was promoted to Lieutenant General and was given command over the new FIFTH DIVISION NORTHERN COMMAND. His military career was still on track when he retired in February 1961, just three months shy of his 49th birthday. He lived in the Brisbane suburbs and later in the 1990s bought an 8,000-hectare ranch north-east of Brisbane called Aventura.\n\nAs a soldier he held a variety of roles. His father and older brother were both commandos in the British Army and he served as an Army Ranger from 1949 until 1952. He served in South Korea where he served through the Korean War, the Korean War (1950-1953), Desert Storm (1991-2003), Desert Shield (1991-2002), The Iraq War (2003) and Operation Urgent Fury (2004). In February 2005 he was appointed Chief of the Defence Force, succeeding David Johnston. While in leadership, he was instrumental in helping to implement the reforms of the Defence Force that resulted in the end of Australia's involvement in the invasion of Iraq on 19 March 2003. In this role he oversaw an expansion of the Army, a large-scale recruiting drive and a decision to deploy additional soldiers to Afghanistan, where he served as commander from June 2011 to February 2012.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, Rowell was the Governor General of Australia. In these two short years, the nation experienced the start of the G20 Summit, the financial crisis, and the September 11 terrorist attacks. He travelled to New York on several occasions as both Prime Minister and Governor-General, visiting with US President George W Bush, and President Barack Obama. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007 by former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and on 13 November 2010, received the highest civilian honour, The Companion of the Order of Australia. As a veteran he took part, along with American actor George Clooney, in this year's 60th anniversary commemorations of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 14 December 1941 and the Japanese surrender on 2 February 1945.\n\nHe had two sons, Robert and William. He is survived by his wife, Alice; a daughter, Sarah Elizabeth, and seven grandchildren.\n\nFor several years after his death, Rowell refused to be buried at his army base, claiming rights as a Commonwealth public representative and refusing to give in the funeral services provided by the Queensland government, until a court victory for Australia's veterans in September 2013. His remains were returned to Australia on 31 February 2015.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a remembrance will be held at 10:00 a.m. at the Goulburn War Memorial, St. John's Hill, Goulburn, QLD, on Friday, 20 February.","token_len":697,"entropy":[5.4764,7.5519,0.2673,4.9624,10.6301,3.6662,0.2323,6.4778,8.2038,0.9455,1.4377,3.2109,0.2931,0.3839,1.4118,6.2259,0.7361,3.4444,0.0661,0.7279,7.9862,9.2791,10.0811,0.9028,0.7059,1.6456,1.6464,3.0938,1.3585,12.6032,0.5482,1.4791,0.7593,7.7562,1.4498,1.2041,5.3178,2.0766,1.023,3.2318,0.4887,1.639,0.4854,1.4625,4.8268,1.0576,5.0714,5.7869,0.0053,0.2967,0.8238,3.8682,4.7445,3.2292,2.9292,1.5542,4.6553,3.4992,2.4909,1.6663,2.769,0.0175,4.5459,0.0043,2.205,2.9746,1.2629,4.9147,0.0004,2.0277,1.2239,1.7924,0.5014,3.9371,0.1095,0.5278,2.708,0.3974,6.1709,4.1389,3.5425,0.2087,3.4059,0.0006,0.0282,5.5236,3.1153,0.9303,0.8593,3.3111,0.6247,2.5687,3.5349,1.7965,4.0409,2.9358,0.8993,5.0556,3.336,1.1165,0.0033,4.3016,4.9928,3.2342,0.7414,0.022,0.0395,1.3569,0.1701,2.0416,1.2191,2.9333,0.5775,4.0541,1.2699,0.7826,2.0327,1.2619,3.457,1.8233,6.0361,1.915,0.0305,0.6121,2.0016,1.7632,3.4375,3.7031,5.8497,5.0878,1.335,2.9052,3.0911,1.7097,0.2941,1.5324,1.7343,1.9335,3.8798,1.6188,0.9536,1.6589,0.0399,1.9297,1.9886,1.128,2.6015,2.0771,1.1412,2.9036,0.5457,3.6437,5.8102,4.5901,1.1834,2.9584,0.1001,0.0127,5.1236,2.0879,0.0035,2.0468,0.0012,1.0556,3.0904,4.2604,0.921,1.0938,5.6023,2.0856,1.8831,0.6999,0.7995,2.6175,0.6606,5.1909,4.0846,1.7853,3.5811,2.7037,0.7138,3.6233,0.0014,0.399,4.8159,0.0057,0.036,0.0629,1.9115,5.3306,1.6556,1.9677,4.8438,2.7636,2.2916,4.7116,1.5999,1.5454,5.3722,0.054,4.7989,2.3382,4.8344,0.9957,0.3639,0.7229,3.2291,0.0,0.0004,3.9903,4.3228,1.897,1.0579,0.0044,1.0055,3.6563,5.3719,5.6169,0.4382,0.7849,0.9489,0.0002,4.2967,1.4396,3.279,1.8842,4.9885,1.4051,2.0566,0.005,3.064,1.741,3.6789,4.3182,3.8868,3.7381,0.1059,1.2074,0.6388,5.9623,0.2765,2.8103,0.3801,2.6666,0.4529,1.5952,1.1671,2.1736,1.7792,1.7559,2.5118,4.4965,4.0442,4.1245,2.2901,2.4587,0.2627,0.9127,2.8476,1.2694,3.567,1.7189,4.8471,0.1421,3.66,6.9304,0.5751,0.3674,0.1387,1.5929,1.704,1.3728,0.8091,1.918,0.5264,0.1053,0.6606,0.0197,0.6747,4.5352,0.1832,0.5393,0.1313,0.237,1.426,0.766,3.0069,0.1984,0.1143,1.2134,0.0646,0.8725,0.7222,4.3939,2.3345,0.1257,0.0943,0.176,4.265,0.0195,1.4264,5.7016,0.0006,0.0014,0.1123,2.8871,0.8748,2.343,4.8544,2.3505,0.8436,0.6836,1.0861,2.2786,0.0499,0.3309,0.3244,0.0667,2.1614,2.8304,4.0243,1.6045,0.4511,5.3172,1.3985,5.9046,2.2392,0.6516,1.6851,4.1519,0.0079,4.8138,0.89,4.7629,0.7189,3.4125,0.8864,0.3161,1.1617,0.1844,2.073,3.1621,0.0221,0.678,3.5373,0.0226,3.8858,0.0409,1.5081,0.0139,0.4483,5.0447,0.1449,0.0515,5.3773,1.3736,0.1356,0.1176,0.1648,2.6743,3.8357,0.2655,0.5206,2.7847,4.3709,3.725,0.163,0.4812,1.6521,1.642,2.9685,5.3755,1.3769,0.0006,4.6585,0.4113,1.1562,1.6028,5.1954,0.1669,4.1561,4.4155,2.6688,0.3511,0.61,3.1311,2.0924,0.759,2.0315,1.3664,4.0143,1.783,3.2796,3.2034,0.9699,2.483,0.2512,0.0663,0.6542,0.0002,4.302,3.8044,0.3917,2.8146,1.1168,0.5854,0.0004,0.6418,1.4386,4.4826,2.09,0.5278,0.3576,0.6105,1.7459,4.5431,2.3515,5.6909,0.6002,1.3809,2.8583,2.3565,2.1676,1.3247,3.9926,0.0406,0.4634,5.1969,0.4038,2.0512,1.4751,0.4176,5.326,0.1503,0.9055,2.5694,0.426,3.78,0.0049,1.3101,0.0436,0.2182,1.5608,5.8529,1.1061,2.8531,0.0734,2.7674,3.6036,0.0623,3.0863,5.4158,1.8703,0.002,0.1089,0.2356,0.5374,0.0047,1.2131,2.5497,2.4874,2.5805,0.1888,0.0657,0.1261,0.6345,1.4841,1.7652,4.1757,0.5357,0.0028,0.2763,1.5003,1.4455,3.3727,3.049,0.7925,0.0309,0.3588,0.0527,0.0058,0.0098,0.3887,2.5665,4.1335,3.0923,2.1762,0.1903,0.0165,0.4477,0.0004,1.6045,4.8048,3.6233,2.2351,2.466,1.5309,4.1791,0.3387,4.0653,1.8599,0.4154,0.8648,3.9379,1.5494,0.0122,0.103,0.0598,0.0076,0.0914,1.2216,4.7853,1.9677,5.5354,2.6429,5.3044,0.4145,6.9328,1.0261,0.0065,6.1875,3.7454,2.8069,0.0223,0.0002,0.1632,0.0398,6.5681,0.0324,0.0026,4.7512,0.03,0.8603,2.76,0.0126,0.226,0.2173,4.8182,0.377,0.0407,0.0754,0.8115,3.6988,2.3753,0.0506,0.0082,3.9433,1.5296,3.957,0.9403,0.725,1.4477,0.6641,0.1159,0.0957,0.6651,0.0002,2.3908,3.7345,2.252,1.3804,0.8171,3.93,0.5903,4.6487,1.3537,1.7793,1.7465,0.0134,0.0067,0.1286,0.3165,0.9935,5.3922,1.1902,2.9184,0.5296,0.1069,3.9078,6.0432,2.2424,0.6893,4.4643,0.0227,0.1726,1.1946,0.0002,4.959,6.3336,0.3097,1.8065,0.3836,0.6418,0.451,1.3339,0.0007,6.2355,0.3792,1.461,0.9095,1.999,2.8059,4.2539,0.8638,1.7854,4.0755,7.8111,2.0041,0.2075,3.1277,3.1988,5.0228,2.2408,3.039,0.2573,3.4242,5.5616,6.3464,4.4777,3.6418,3.2819,0.7917,0.3486,2.8491,2.1747,3.039,3.8872,2.3274,2.5188,6.6629,4.1891,6.2744,0.9497,2.1118,1.915,4.5001,2.2705,0.4606,2.7591,1.5429,0.2481,1.8622,0.1099,0.8738,1.7162,4.2038,4.845,1.8724,0.6539,1.0498,0.0002,2.635,5.8767,0.0037,0.0669,0.202,2.7906,4.7123,1.8878,0.0383,0.289,0.6953,4.5376,1.6939,0.4394,2.2486,0.0014,0.0007,0.0568,2.8397,0.7201,4.7439,1.4897,0.0002,1.5349,0.2939,1.4994,5.021,1.2724,3.321,0.0745,3.8942,0.2049,0.892,0.0007,0.0001,0.8766,0.9884,0.3456,0.8705,0.7123,2.3091,1.5969,3.7818,1.3542,1.5236]}
{"id":2523,"ended":true,"length":650,"gen_text":"Compared to its closest wild cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer legs. Its feet have adapted for climbing trees and its paws are short and strong to hold onto tree branches and limbs. Its powerful legs allow it to run fast for short periods in the woods, its powerful jaws and teeth allow it to tear flesh from bone and stone, and its powerful neck and shoulders allow it to carry heavy loads in strong winds.\n\nWhen startled, wolves will raise their heads, but quickly lie down again. When hunting, wolves will turn and look for their next prey. To the untrained eye, wolves are indistinguishable from any coyote or black bear with their black fur, dark brown eyes, and long, pointy tails. Wolves have more teeth than small pets, and they prefer living in large packs with adult males taking on most hunting duties. Wolves are carnivores and are generally not as docile toward people as most dogs are. However, they are still known to show some form of respect for humans.\n\nGray wolves were given protected status in the State of Idaho on November 14, 2000. They were not included on the official American Canine Association (ACA) Canine Health Protection Plan in 2002, because the Gray Wolf Conservation Act was not passed (the act allows only hunting and trapping ).\n\nThe gray wolf is one of the most endangered species in the world, having lost 98% of the habitat it once inhabited in the last 200 years.\n\nWolf is the official state amphibian of Montana, and one of the only wild and free-roaming species of amphibian in North America, and only the second in the world. In Montana, wolves live in the upper valley watershed of the Umatilla River, which runs through Montana's Flathead Valley, and east to the Snake River in Idaho. All wolves in Montana are identified by the color of their fur (black, coyote or brown).\n\nMost gray wolves in Montana are nocturnal, meaning they are inactive during daylight hours. They rely on hearing, sight and their keen sense of hearing to find their food. Wolves can detect food up to several hundred feet away and can detect human food from over a mile away, thanks to their keen sense of hearing. When wolves do hunt, they generally target large loners and can be very aggressive if the hunter's movements are unknown. They also prey on small mammals like chipmunks, snowshoe hares and ground squirrels. Wolves also enjoy eating rabbits and other small rodents, especially during the fall and spring months. Wolves typically travel alone, but when a pack of more than 8 wolves appears foraging, it may take several weeks for other wolves to join the group. Wolves are not territorial and will not kill a person just to feed themselves, which is not surprising considering that wolves are carnivores and are not friendly toward people, despite being able to detect humans better than a coyote or black bear can.\n\nIn Yellowstone National Park, gray wolves have an estimated population of 400-500 living in four packs in different territories of the

{"id":2812,"ended":true,"length":602,"gen_text":"Inbreeding tends to occur in flocks of limited size and where only a single or a few rams are used. Associated with inbreeding is a decline in progeny performance usually referred to as inbreeding depression. Inbreeding promotes inbreeding depression since those inbred sheep that are bred to have more inbred animals will also have less progeny.\n\nRams that have inseminated a number of females but are less inbred will tend to produce more offspring than those produced after multiple matings of the same matings in the same flock. Those less inbred are also less likely to produce more than one or two offspring or have more heterozygous offspring. (For more details see Inbreeding, and the chapter Genetic drift on our Web site.)\n\nIn a flock of limited size, inbreeding may be more beneficial than inbreeding depression.\n\nInbreeding depression in the breeding of sheep is thought to be caused by an inability to detect heterozygous offspring from heterozygous parents.\n\nInbred sheep, however, normally carry no genetic markers to distinguish between sheep from different parent s.\n\nInbreeding depression is more of a problem in flocks with small numbers of rams and those in which the breeding of rams is restricted to 2-3 per flock. (For more details see the table below.)\n\nInbreeding depression in the breeding of sheep affects the health of the sheep, is correlated with increased prevalence of hereditary cancers in the flock, and increases the chance that those infected will lose the immune system over a two or three generation time frame.\n\nThere are several measures that can be taken to reduce rams from producing too many lambs in a flock.\n\nRams with too many lambs in a flock may become infected, and their immune system suffers from being attacked by other rams. The amount of infection depends on which rams are infected and which ones are able to protect themselves. All rams will be affected at one time or another because there will be a small percentage of outbreeding. There is little that can be done to prevent the spread of infection by any particular individual. The problem in the end is that, because of the low risk to the flock, the number of lambs in the flock tends to make it advantageous for all rams to breed more, not less.\n\nIn addition to reducing the rams from breeding too many lambs in a flock, all rams need to be treated with a disease control drug to reduce infection. Because the disease control drug limits the number of lambs who, by means of that drug, are infected, this can help diminish the incidence of infection by either reducing the number of rams that are infected and so reducing infection, or by slowing down the time it takes the rams to develop infection.\n\nBecause there is an increase in lameness and other problems in the flock when enough rams in a flock are infected, most states have laws against the breeding of rams with an excessive number of lambs in a flock.\n\nCitation for this article:\n\nRabback, Robert, PhD. 2001.

{"id":2978,"ended":false,"length":622,"gen_text":"After three seasons at UVA, L\u00f3pez was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft. He began his minor league career as a bench player for the Diamondbacks' affiliate Portland Beavers ( A ) in 1992 and spent parts of three seasons there before becoming the Beavers' designated hitter for the 1993 season. L\u00f3pez played for the Detroit Tigers from 1994-1997 after his draft season.\n\nMajor league [ edit ]\n\nAlfredo Lopez, a Venezuelan-born outfielder with a solid glove and strong arm, has taken his talents to New York City. His fastball has always been in the high 90s and occasionally in the upper 90s, but is now regularly up into the high 90s. A change of location away from the plate has allowed Lopez to make a full recovery from a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered earlier this year, though he has not reached his full potential yet, considering the new location of his fastball. Lopez, however, has a very solid change-up that has helped keep some of the strikeouts from his fastball in check. He's not a great defensive outfielder and is known for getting fooled by some very good pitches like sinker, slider, and curve, but there isn't much else he can do about these deficiencies. His power has been solid, though he's not exactly the type of guy who is going to go out and hit every ball out of the ballpark. This is something that will work in the favor of his fantasy owners, because he could provide some RBI opportunities, and he's a capable defender at first base and second base, and if he can hit, the Red Sox could use some help at first and second base.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nLopez is married to his college sweetheart, Maritona Gonz\u00e1lez de Carabajal. The pair is planning to have three children. L\u00f3pez's father was part of the Houston Astros organization when Maritona was born in 2001. He played centerfield with the Astros from 1989-1990, but was released after one season.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nAlfredo Lopez played for the Venezuelan Independent League ( VLI ), a Caribbean Class A league. The team won the championship in 2005, defeating Venezuela's national team 7-6 in the championship game.\n\nBaseball Prospectus included him in its 2007 ranking of the best 20 prospects in baseball,[3] as well as the first of numerous profiles on Lopez since he arrived in the U.S.\n\nInjuries [ edit ]\n\nSince his rookie season in 2008, Lopez has been dealt with three shoulder injuries and a partially torn labrum (his right shoulder). The shoulder injuries led to a delayed return for 2008 and hindered his performance during the final nine months of 2009. He played in seven postseason games with Atlanta (A-ball) after breaking his right shoulder before the 2009 season, missing much of May 2009 and July of 2009.[4]\n\nWhen the 2010 season came, Lopez had surgery to repair a partially torn labrum. After returning in 2013, he struggled with a shoulder injury and then in October 2013 was placed on the disabled list for a second time.

{"id":4045,"ended":false,"length":649,"gen_text":"The Brigade was alerted for deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2005. In the summer of 2006, it trained for three months at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to provide military support for Iraqi forces and conduct intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations in support of U.S. forces on the ground across Iraq.\n\nThe brigade's initial deployment, which took place in April 2007, took part in the first major training mission of the Iraqi Army and its fledgling army during the early phases of the Anbar Rebellion, and during this deployment was used to support the Baghdad government in the conduct of its counterinsurgency operations. In December 2007, the Brigade rotated to Kuwait and deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division to Afghanistan. In August 2008, the Brigade deployed alongside the 82nd Airborne Division to South and Central America for a deployment that lasted until February 2008, when it deployed with the 82nd Airborne Division to support the campaign against al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the brigade continued to support Operation Iraqi Freedom while on the ground in support of Iraqi forces. In March 2009, the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Federal Police transitioned to the new Iraqi Security Forces Command based in Kabul. The brigade was then sent to Iraq for a rotation back to Southwest Asia through the remainder of 2009. The brigade returned to Iraq in July 2009 to help establish security in the country. At the conclusion of the war in December 2011, the brigade returned to Afghanistan and continued the transition of the security forces into Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) forces.\n\nThe brigade completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 2015 and deployed back to Kuwait for a rotation from April to September, then back to the United States for a permanent deployment from January 26 through June 30, 2016. After deployment, the brigade continued to assist the Iraqi Security Forces in operations as a training element with the help of an international coalition. On June 26, 2016, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, awarded the brigade the Silver Star Medal for distinguished conduct for its role in advising and providing advisors to Iraqi Security Forces in the fight against ISIL. The Silver Star was made possible by the generosity of a Kuwaiti citizen who gave $100,000 as part of the Kuwait Foundation for Specialized Scholarships. Additionally, Lt. Gen. Townsend awarded the brigade another Silver Star Medal for being on the ground in Iraq to help rebuild the Iraqi security forces after ISIL overran Mosul. Additionally, the brigade is recognized for providing critical training to help the Iraqis defend themselves against ISIL in the Sinjar Mountains and Nineveh.\n\nThe brigade is on active duty with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and plays a role in the border security mission. During the past two years, the brigade has also served on two combat duty teams, and four multinational training teams in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In FY 2016, the brigade supported operations in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq with a total of 11 forces from the battalion. This is one of the largest deployments for a National Guard battalion of its kind in United States history.

{"id":1743,"ended":true,"length":664,"gen_text":"Throughout 2000, Carey had already been writing and recording material for Glitter. During this period, she developed the concept for the album's lead single, `` Loverboy ``. Originally, she intended to name it in praise of her boyfriend, but the moniker `` Loverboy `` struck her as too heavy-handed. After some revisions she settled on'Lace in the Coffin '' as a reference to the singer Bob Dylan's classic song. `` This song is all about coming to terms with the realities of life in America and coming to terms with where he got himself from and it's interesting to talk to your wife or girlfriend about how it's always so hard to make your way in this world and I think that's a good metaphor for where ` Lace in the Coffin --- I don't want to use this word ` cemetary `, but I can't be the only one who goes through some stuff in her own life and can't find any hope or any relief and that's what we're all going through and that's a very big part of my concept,and so I said that's about it. I've found that the most powerful words are the simplest. A simple word and I think that's a very powerful metaphor.\n\nAfter initially attempting to use an entire chorus of ` A new beginning,' the group came to the conclusion that the verse should feature only the lead line:\n\nIn December 2000's live performance of the song,, Carey chose to use the full chorus on the tour. Carey has stated in interviews that the idea that the song would feature the entire song came from the audience, and she went into detail about the inspiration behind choosing that particular option in her 2002 autobiography,, \" Unbreakable: My Journey From Depression to Hope, Love and the Voice of an Angel \".\n\nAlthough the lyrics were changed, the final version of the song didn't sound anything like the version released on. The song was also released separately under the alias `` Lace in the Coffin,'' which was the same name used for the album. An alternate arrangement of the song, with an intro that sounds like an early version of the song, was performed on. Carey had to cancel two shows when the initial versions leaked on MySpace and was soon removed from the internet.\n\nRecorded by Carey on January 4, 2001, The Fragile is the only track on the record that didn't make the final album, partly due to the final mix having an inferior audio quality.\n\nThe first single from the album was released on March 10, 2002 as \" I Don't Want to Worry About You Anymore.'\n\n.\n\nThe song is on the \" Best of 2005 \" compilation, which was released on September 7, 2005. The song was included on all editions of the compilation.\n\n\" compilation, which was released on September 7, 2005. \" The song is also used in the \" Lush Life \" music video.\n\n\" music video. After multiple remixes, the new version of the song was debuted by the band at a live show hosted by E! Australia on September 25, 2013. The song was performed with a full band in front of an audience of 12,600 at Sydney's Allphones Arena.

{"id":1240,"ended":false,"length":666,"gen_text":"In January 2006, Minor selected the University of Michigan. Although he did not enroll in the 2006 Summer semester, he reported to Michigan on June 16 for strength and conditioning training. Minor played three games that spring for the Wolverines and recorded one tackle.\n\n Minor's career at Michigan began to take shape in August 2006 when he chose to play junior college football at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville. In January 2007, after participating in four games for the Redbirds and contributing three tackles, Minor transferred to Wisconsin, a move he made less than three months before the 2007 season began. In his four games at Wisconsin, Minor finished with 9 tackles. Following the season, Minor decided to return to Southern Illinois because he thought he could play faster at the FCS level. A few days later, he decided to stay at Michigan. Michigan placed Minor on scholarship in August 2008, and in the fall, Minor attended classes at U-M. He redshirted in 2009 and enrolled in the class of 2010.\n\nPersonal [ edit ]\n\nMinor's father Richard was a lawyer during the Vietnam War. He grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. His father died when Minor was 18 from complications of a bone marrow transplant. Minor's brother, Stephen, was killed in an automobile accident while living overseas in the latter part of the Vietnam war. The tragedy left Minor's parents with only a few hundred dollars.\n\nAfter graduating from U-M, Minor began a business marketing course. He graduated in 2002 and began a law associate in law school at Michigan Law School as a full-time student that fall. He also took one year off after graduation and joined the Army as an Infantryman in the reserve program, then went to the National Guard for one year. When he graduated in 2005, Minor began working at U-M as a faculty member of the Department of Civil Engineering, a job that is similar to teaching. He also worked in the faculty lounge at the university for two summers (2006 and 2007). In June 2009, Major Minor joined the Department of Engineering at U-M, a position he holds today.\n\nMajor Minor has served in combat, including in the Iraq war at one point. He was shot three times in 2004, once by a sniper while helping with an emergency on a roadside, and twice by a sniper while on his motorcycle. He sustained one bullet fragment fracture to his elbow at one point in battle, and suffered severe trauma to his right knee during a nighttime ambush. According to his mother, Minor has PTSD since he took his body armor off in Iraq.\n\nMinority students are currently underrepresented at the University of Michigan, a fact that is evident in Minor's academic records. He does not have the lowest standardized test scores among the black students he interacts with. He does, however, report the fewest minority students of any student on campus at 13%, which is not surprising considering his status as the best player on a very good team, with an average offensive line and a star quarterback. Minor is also the highest GPA of any U-M student, with an average of 6.94. Minor is no stranger to controversy as he has faced allegations of racial discrimination as his father was accused of racism by some African-American classmates due to his status as a \"white\" man. Major Minor denies the claims, stating that it was not because of his father's race, but a lack of sensitivity to people of color.\n\nBibliography [ edit

{"id":4603,"ended":false,"length":624,"gen_text":"When the 6th Division was formed in October 1939, Sir Thomas Blamey appointed Rowell as its GSO1 ( chief of staff ). Rowell joined the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and became its Commander in 1939 in the role created by Lieutenant General David Fraser.\n\nRowell did not play any significant role in the development of the Bismarck to Rommel doctrine, although he did develop the new strategic doctrine that was introduced in 1940 under Captain Sir Frederick Jellicoe. He also served as the AIF's second in command from August 1940 until Lieutenant General Alexander Beresford took over in April 1941, after being demoted. On 6 December 1941 Rowell was promoted to GSO2, and on 9 May 1943 was promoted to the rank of Adjutant General.\n\nIt is now known that Rowell was the architect of the strategic doctrine that was adopted by the Royal Air Force in 1943 and adopted by the British Army during the Normandy campaign in 1944. The strategy involved the use of several types of bombs using a layered approach to attack a target, so that the enemy would have to keep moving through the air to evade them.\n\nRowell's doctrine was not as flexible as that of General Doolittle, but it had some advantages. From the AEF's perspective the doctrine provided one of the few viable combat operations which could be conducted in the theatre of war on the Western Front. This doctrine was developed during the war months, and implemented after the D-Day operations. The operational concepts of Rowell's doctrine were refined and then employed effectively in the Battle of the Atlantic. The principle of flexible approach coupled with fixed and mobile bases, as the core of Rowell's doctrine, made possible the effective application of combined arms on continental and oceanic maps.\n\n\nSir Humphrey Lawrence, a Canadian Air Force fighter pilot who was flown in the famous 'Battle of Britain'. Lawrence's skill gave him an advantage over his enemy. He led an American bombers against British bombers.\n\nFrom July 1942, the Second Canadian Army was formed when Captain Fred Wood took command of the Army Air Corps. Wood became the GSO2 of the Army Air Corps until his promotion to Major General in the summer of 1944. The Air Corps was soon involved in several decisive battles which were important in the defeat of the Wehrmacht. When General Eisenhower assumed command of the Western Front in November 1944, the Canadian Air Force became the major Allied heavy fighter force.\n\nAfter World War 2 the Second Canadian Army became the 1st Canadian Army. This unit continued to serve until 1951.\n\nThe Second Canadian War Museum was established September 29, 1947. The museum is on Veterans Memorial Avenue and houses exhibits from the Second World War and the War of 1812. The museum also houses the Canada's Military History Research Centre, which is a large complex of displays on the history of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe museum was founded by the family of Colonel Fred Wood, who was one of the founding members of the Military History Research Center.\n\nReferences \u2013 The Canadian Press\n\n[1] \"General Staff of the Canadian Air Forces\"\n\n[2] T.C.

{"id":2027,"ended":true,"length":678,"gen_text":"During the fighting, out of a total of 976 men deployed, the battalion lost 137 men killed in action and 106 wounded, while a further 24 suffered from shell shock. A final report noted that in the period July to December 1941, only 6 of the men had experienced any serious psychological problem. By December the mental state of the battalion's men had improved appreciably. Only 1 major mental problem had emerged, though the report did acknowledge that some men's minds had'become so overladen '. The report concluded that\n\nThere were signs of improvement from 1st August, and the battalion was now able to fight against superior numbers with the use of heavier weapons. To this effect, the battalion moved on 9th October 1941 to a new fighting position near Wurzburg which it had occupied on 13th April. As a result more men were withdrawn to the west and the battalion was further withdrawn to the east. In addition to these movements the division headquarters increased the size of the division reserve and, as there was no reserve reserve in the zone, a second divisional reserve of the 11th Panzer Army was sent to the rear.\n\n'From this time on there was no question of a break in the operations,' the report said.\n\nIn December 1941, during a visit to the front, Churchill saw the German soldiers:'There was so much energy, so much courage in these young men that I could hardly bear to see the wretched Germans! With the possible exception of my very short tour of Germany in February this time last year, that was as clear, vivid and unblinking as I have ever seen a German face.'\n\nIt would be an achievement to record how many years, and how many thousands of soldiers had lived on during so terrible a time. I should say that at my own death, when all have received a final memorial, I am confident that my record is, in fact, final. On my own death I shall have gone through the most difficult period of my life during which time, it is true, many happy memories have developed. These memories include many good people, people who have been good to me and, through them, to many other people.\n\nOn my death many new friends will have been added to those I have already met on my campaign, and others will be found in the new world that has opened up after the first year of war. I hope that my friends on the Front will continue to help their country and to help me to share in their joy. I hope that these friends who, like myself, found some comfort from the people of Norway, will be content with their new friendship, if only they will help me to share their joy of life, to take the burden off my shoulders, to make it a joy, for they can enjoy it without me.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to give the Norwegian people one simple message: it is not easy to endure war. Yet, the brave Norwegian soldiers will no doubt continue in the service of their homeland, to preserve the memory of those comrades, to carry on the fight against the enemies of Norway and to continue the work of their country, which is the work of all free people. Norway is not an easy country, but it is our motherland, and no man has given his life for Norway, not in a matter of life or death. Sooner or later, however difficult a time may be, Norway will find its way, I am sure of that.","token_len":706,"entropy":[0.8467,7.851,0.6419,8.8033,0.3872,2.8859,1.3448,0.137,4.2993,4.9494,4.152,5.3466,1.0482,3.3249,4.405,1.0996,6.1141,1.0568,2.7808,2.3897,0.0139,1.1686,6.4681,0.698,1.8894,2.9138,4.6192,0.236,4.7816,4.2857,3.251,5.8386,0.5557,0.7461,3.9527,5.9372,3.0908,4.6996,0.3323,4.2881,1.1682,4.17,4.1394,1.4127,1.2491,2.7939,0.5337,3.4803,4.0781,2.2904,0.2642,2.8604,1.8771,4.6141,1.8146,2.9608,2.5571,3.0819,0.8602,4.8624,3.2645,2.837,5.9381,2.3807,0.0416,0.4238,1.5693,3.16,0.6986,0.4273,0.5235,5.2187,0.0008,0.8505,5.2235,3.556,6.485,2.9596,1.1759,0.7732,3.7019,1.963,4.5347,2.4002,2.9777,3.1546,4.049,0.3526,3.0839,1.3176,4.3044,5.0907,0.9526,10.9678,4.668,0.0055,1.8516,4.871,4.1389,9.2593,3.3966,2.3765,1.7053,0.6683,6.235,0.0026,5.3631,3.081,5.6436,0.663,2.214,4.1517,3.9672,1.5632,3.5465,1.7766,1.9429,1.8405,2.2722,1.4768,3.4645,2.1793,0.0352,4.5366,4.4434,3.2988,1.2361,3.1801,2.5092,5.5123,0.0137,4.9559,0.5356,0.9404,5.9661,2.4199,2.4028,0.7785,0.9685,1.1991,4.5651,3.6184,4.2111,0.1578,2.2,2.8928,1.1113,2.4137,0.932,6.3202,0.2274,3.3741,5.1727,3.5214,0.3832,0.0338,4.2268,2.2479,1.475,1.4995,1.3389,3.8968,0.071,3.2704,0.5583,4.9348,0.9895,0.1016,7.7685,0.8947,0.6471,4.8466,2.0768,1.0909,5.0662,1.5296,1.0527,1.0812,1.1227,5.2435,4.7089,0.6727,0.8976,1.1359,1.2833,2.9894,2.4269,1.3755,2.7102,2.0171,1.8988,4.4253,3.5397,5.2476,0.471,3.1186,0.0244,0.2606,2.5943,1.4223,2.3641,3.9943,2.2473,5.9129,0.5676,0.6723,3.839,3.843,1.2807,0.3939,4.5446,1.793,2.9841,3.9764,2.7077,0.6076,0.3353,3.8248,2.4068,4.7876,0.0248,1.713,3.3389,0.2812,2.9848,0.5167,0.7029,5.2095,0.771,1.1672,0.0003,5.1212,4.2555,2.9291,1.0082,1.5887,3.4135,0.5148,1.0959,4.034,0.16,2.56,4.4097,1.3177,0.2909,4.5427,4.6092,0.591,0.1433,2.3964,0.3927,1.431,0.0002,2.8045,3.3251,0.799,1.1704,4.6182,1.9731,4.3037,0.2556,0.472,3.2261,0.8051,4.6129,4.8883,0.9634,3.9605,4.1192,12.0954,4.0225,1.083,5.5872,0.2193,4.9633,1.6162,0.9631,0.1818,3.0767,3.1449,3.7368,3.7684,0.2328,1.77,1.3085,2.0705,2.1361,3.0288,0.396,2.1057,3.3917,5.0684,5.5005,5.3367,5.8371,1.8591,6.0521,0.0286,0.0124,4.6943,5.9592,6.0484,4.7808,0.8281,3.5824,1.1856,4.408,3.5403,4.8561,1.856,0.0843,0.258,5.7156,0.9107,4.7368,5.1352,4.0109,3.9091,0.416,4.8347,3.2439,0.3461,0.6653,1.4781,0.4001,0.1282,0.4168,2.1898,1.6058,0.5088,1.3917,0.6005,0.0002,4.3444,3.6925,0.8155,3.8905,7.4642,2.5854,4.3319,4.0958,1.1155,5.3332,3.8207,1.9205,0.9956,0.1985,4.0908,0.0667,3.0116,4.345,4.0711,4.0094,4.1432,6.824,4.3078,0.1745,0.9767,0.6391,4.6748,4.1937,2.2851,0.8878,4.1004,5.2207,1.5622,2.5839,1.706,2.9152,3.3443,5.8221,6.0706,2.6713,2.37,5.3757,0.8743,1.0712,3.7923,2.0426,0.2099,2.8508,5.058,5.1893,4.6919,1.9064,3.0068,0.0134,5.66,0.6746,5.6796,2.3781,1.8286,1.6811,1.1476,0.9925,1.8501,4.1662,2.2508,1.4656,2.9464,2.7614,1.3851,0.3763,0.2608,0.1197,6.3968,0.4085,3.1127,2.9866,4.8701,0.9183,0.6852,0.0259,3.1944,5.8578,1.0717,0.7541,6.38,1.1162,4.974,1.8992,4.1287,2.4408,4.0618,3.4265,1.1317,5.1125,0.8419,1.1844,1.8713,2.3238,0.2527,0.0193,1.6755,3.9419,4.4962,1.7172,0.0593,0.581,1.3865,1.8793,0.5242,0.5294,2.0412,0.0002,3.992,1.5637,0.7416,4.7522,5.3946,3.0903,0.5762,2.4717,1.5753,2.8673,0.5505,2.1323,1.2343,0.383,0.905,1.6525,4.192,1.6104,5.2602,1.883,0.8399,3.9809,0.7411,1.3835,3.056,2.1374,0.7072,3.8748,2.53,1.7714,2.4176,1.4669,0.5244,3.5626,0.6642,5.6855,4.1356,0.4538,1.6011,0.2925,1.8564,2.4043,0.5677,2.5756,2.4477,3.9226,0.9066,4.3817,0.3848,3.5064,0.1664,3.6966,4.5877,3.7584,1.9159,1.8811,1.7431,1.3873,2.3903,4.6128,1.2025,0.9912,1.6123,1.7853,1.8805,1.8725,0.398,4.8146,0.9619,4.1717,4.7903,2.4843,1.1375,0.0707,5.6002,5.1734,2.4388,2.9343,0.7962,5.3434,1.3666,6.7221,1.0197,0.5765,2.4115,6.2416,1.2465,1.7778,1.8637,3.7369,1.6754,5.4685,2.1539,2.5303,2.0725,3.7546,1.2005,0.4331,1.5249,1.9588,0.5307,4.4373,1.8828,2.617,4.0934,4.8849,2.5711,3.679,1.8509,1.5258,0.3285,1.1008,1.4238,3.288,2.2868,3.2999,3.321,1.858,4.1673,1.8663,3.8166,3.826,0.9098,2.9762,1.667,0.4755,0.6013,0.0002,3.3065,2.707,0.4994,0.5684,3.0928,0.0603,4.424,2.5255,3.3748,0.1254,2.6093,5.4729,1.1319,1.1236,3.865,0.2924,1.9831,3.6151,0.3454,3.9803,2.1755,1.2562,4.4032,1.7466,3.5589,4.8328,1.2172,1.1851,4.6218,5.7362,0.3225,2.1724,3.5418,0.9901,2.5007,0.0296,0.3342,3.4347,1.3461,3.7456,5.0678,1.6553,4.2797,0.0342,2.6921,5.7344,3.6809,1.9151,3.4084,0.2928,0.6367,1.7249,1.2585,1.1272,1.8194,0.2393,1.8649,1.1569,0.5661,3.4508,1.0657,2.2491,0.7886,3.6862,1.6617,1.7696,1.2962,1.3573,2.0257,2.0947,0.1224,1.7731,2.8879,1.1171,0.7252,5.8346,1.7248,2.3668,3.6967,2.1132,0.3378,2.0664,0.6327,1.0061,0.3345,3.9033,4.2294,0.3614,1.0349,0.4851,4.5211,3.9224,3.0931,4.8663,1.623,0.0973,0.5292,1.184,1.926,1.9043,2.4193,2.8727,6.4664,0.2665,1.2688,1.0776,0.0285,0.4924,5.2878,4.0663,0.026,0.0032,1.0139,3.9326,2.7736,4.3898,0.9759,1.2116,0.1449,0.0877,2.3218,0.3001,3.172,1.7929,0.5183,2.6404,5.9508,0.9642,0.5278,1.4552,0.5907,0.3677]}
{"id":1586,"ended":true,"length":635,"gen_text":"A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The system entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and then moved over the Bering Sea. The current storm passed over the United States on August 6 and will continue to move eastbound over the Canadian and Mexican coasts through the end of the week.\n\nThis Tropical Cyclone is forecast to remain active over the Caribbean during next 48 hours after coming ashore. The strongest winds will be in the west-northwest near 30 knots (40 mph), with gusts up to 50 knots (55 mph) along the western coast from northern Baja California up to the Canadian border; these winds will cause life threatening wind effects to the coast with rip current along shorelines. If any areas of south-west South America experience large amounts of rain, they will likely experience flood-related impacts with the possible flooding of large canals, coastal rivers and creeks. Large waves will be produced along the coastline from the Baja California north to northern Panama, and coastal flooding during the next 48 hours will be likely. Also, wind gusts of up to 70 knots will become possible as the system moves west over the coast of southwestern Mexico towards the southern US.\n\nHurricane Ophelia made landfall in the UK on Sunday, 5th September (5.09 AM CDT) along the north west coast. Ophelia was the first hurricane to make landfall in the USA since Hurricane Wilma on October 30, 2005. The storm remains at the point of maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. The UK Meteorological Office will issue updated forecast information on Monday 9th September at 7 am EDT, including further details on the evolution of Ophelia, and their projections for the next 48 hours.\n\nThis is the first hurricane in the Atlantic since August 1st, 1998 that formed along the eastern Atlantic seaboard. On August 2nd at 12:16 PM CDT Hurricane Sandy formed at the east coast south of New Jersey. Sandy was the second storm of the season to make landfall during the first 11 days of the Atlantic hurricane season, with the last being Hurricane Camille on September 1, 1928.\n\nA tropical storm is a rare and exciting event that occurs frequently in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. A tropical cyclone is characterized by relatively high wind speed and gusts and can be either a low pressure system or heavy sea-surface temperature inversions.\n\nThe first of these Atlantic hurricane records was set in 1934, when Hurricane Charley formed in the Atlantic ocean near Bermuda. Charley dissipated and then returned on October 7, 1934. When Charley and Ophelia formed on August 5 and August 7, respectively, Atlantic hurricane records were only made in August, thus they remain the fewest-since-dating-the-record in the USA in recorded history. A tropical storm is more likely to form along the West Coast than in the Atlantic - and yet in a way, they are the same.\n\nThis historic opportunity to observe multiple tropical cyclones in their full strength in the Atlantic basin will have tremendous implications for research (including modeling), as well as monitoring of sea surface temperatures, rainfall, storm tracks and energy fields in the next 48 hours. The opportunity to observe these massive systems, both in the Atlantic and Gulf Stream, is something not seen before, and will further increase the research value and usefulness of the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season.","token_len":707,"entropy":[10.2496,6.0238,5.6564,4.3442,0.381,4.2677,0.2342,0.0796,2.3475,2.0865,4.1033,3.3102,0.6524,5.4995,4.0473,0.3609,1.112,0.6143,1.1056,6.6517,0.1285,7.8444,4.6914,5.4842,0.8282,1.6768,3.2353,6.1663,0.2104,4.9128,2.1958,0.2401,2.6128,2.0884,2.3897,2.1979,3.6601,0.3872,3.5278,0.5168,0.2065,1.5199,1.5982,4.2749,4.1976,4.6375,1.2239,0.7936,3.2189,0.0707,0.8169,0.196,1.4734,1.7927,3.0711,1.7791,0.6688,0.9174,1.7964,6.0954,1.8328,0.1743,5.4702,1.9777,2.9813,1.0077,2.5761,0.9535,1.8108,0.0015,0.4972,0.1399,0.2136,1.0235,0.001,3.5813,6.1736,1.9341,0.0001,2.3371,2.6503,0.03,2.4718,4.0685,2.0915,0.1939,3.664,5.3063,3.4542,2.8695,0.1207,7.511,6.0463,0.1469,1.4861,1.5973,4.6728,0.4729,1.4174,0.8465,1.8121,0.0815,3.7286,1.7677,0.305,0.0108,2.3355,4.498,1.5326,2.0871,2.5124,0.4245,1.3062,1.8748,1.7093,0.0183,2.1944,0.0072,1.5036,0.1053,0.0803,1.0924,0.0061,1.0779,2.5394,0.1573,3.6063,0.4223,4.1703,4.0089,2.3684,0.0246,0.1022,3.5033,0.7741,1.3427,5.6264,0.7694,6.2651,2.2181,0.6935,0.371,3.6485,1.2831,2.1467,2.493,4.6447,1.8395,1.6972,3.3374,4.8982,5.2569,1.2647,3.3116,4.708,0.2501,0.6299,5.6231,3.7866,3.7927,1.3212,5.7539,1.2073,2.8144,6.4184,0.3271,1.6087,4.5589,1.2694,0.0079,1.8337,0.5609,2.7211,1.1545,2.0189,0.6905,5.2135,3.1968,1.1282,2.2872,3.351,2.4895,4.0357,3.1938,0.1256,4.11,6.8863,0.0407,1.953,5.1547,3.0115,1.0078,2.2265,0.002,0.0,0.2887,4.9558,3.0675,1.0707,1.6821,2.8192,1.0339,0.2396,3.2295,2.4617,1.4254,3.5138,0.0133,0.2381,4.2633,1.3444,2.3258,4.0506,1.5137,1.3034,4.6605,1.5961,6.764,1.0224,0.4179,1.1318,0.0579,1.4119,0.7716,2.2413,0.8881,6.2143,0.3196,4.8879,0.4786,0.009,1.3859,1.2552,0.0063,2.3665,0.5526,3.0357,6.1454,1.154,3.8467,0.5213,0.9751,0.3486,3.2975,2.7143,0.4168,4.5779,0.3556,6.0882,1.2116,5.5874,0.434,3.7622,3.7321,0.5149,0.8648,0.0002,4.18,0.049,4.9563,0.0074,0.0002,4.0721,0.0359,0.7874,1.5874,1.5848,0.506,3.1462,1.2943,5.6207,2.2347,1.9124,4.8549,3.8336,0.922,2.2393,3.0177,3.5385,0.0001,1.2655,4.5164,0.1432,2.5543,2.6216,0.0984,2.8358,1.602,0.0004,0.0004,2.0136,1.8628,1.119,1.1582,0.7663,0.5273,0.1111,0.3942,0.1863,6.4524,0.3829,1.0622,0.9887,0.0001,2.4384,1.7903,3.7786,0.1147,0.0178,0.3336,1.8572,1.3115,5.4097,2.7141,2.581,5.1347,0.1833,0.554,0.5185,0.0809,0.9937,2.842,0.7624,1.9934,1.8369,3.0871,1.5312,0.1509,0.2249,4.867,1.4059,4.2318,3.4897,1.7169,1.5805,0.4467,4.7786,0.0934,0.0823,1.7465,3.2129,1.8731,2.9013,2.9861,2.4585,3.9084,1.1348,0.7099,0.9528,4.565,0.1092,0.5225,0.0006,0.0004,2.6387,1.7012,5.3019,4.2063,0.4999,0.7245,1.493,0.797,0.0267,0.1605,0.6254,0.0002,3.9839,1.6401,0.9549,1.7414,1.3581,2.7165,0.8115,0.2274,1.7718,3.7643,3.7977,1.0184,0.9656,4.4343,4.0326,3.5892,4.2951,0.1848,2.3398,3.6921,3.1842,0.018,0.0007,0.7952,4.7511,1.1255,2.1647,0.0562,4.9034,3.143,0.8041,4.7814,1.828,0.9753,0.0003,3.2896,4.0804,1.5605,3.705,0.7609,4.0055,0.2945,7.458,0.136,1.7778,0.8273,0.9487,2.1704,1.8055,0.8433,2.6347,3.6595,2.1898,0.4857,0.9542,0.6289,1.7038,0.0158,5.3224,0.4174,3.5776,4.6119,0.086,0.2506,0.5317,2.4301,0.1856,0.004,1.8381,2.7888,1.1205,4.155,1.9649,0.2742,4.7209,0.0084,0.6945,1.3803,2.3672,2.0795,5.6905,0.2834,0.8897,0.0002,3.7753,1.2943,1.3273,2.4476,1.8272,5.1908,2.7073,4.4395,0.6187,1.8629,1.915,5.0622,0.9401,0.1008,4.0916,2.2496,1.3262,0.567,0.2573,0.5125,0.0003,0.3872,3.3957,0.3105,1.3944,0.0016,0.7692,2.687,0.0313,5.3348,3.1752,1.3213,2.0976,0.9006,4.5547,0.2121,3.0529,3.0219,1.6867,3.3234,1.1315,4.198,0.334,0.2439,0.4178,7.1993,4.4137,1.0243,0.2734,1.0516,2.3793,2.5747,0.4054,2.3831,0.0002,2.2452,3.7851,4.5137,3.0427,5.4987,3.2705,5.9432,0.539,0.3919,1.347,5.0107,1.3116,0.2957,1.6296,2.4789,0.0036,1.0019,1.3183,0.157,1.4438,4.8034,2.1573,1.172,0.6154,1.4209,0.0009,5.411,0.0011,2.9079,2.7189,3.3686,2.7426,2.3146,3.2677,0.8697,0.6027,1.2637,5.8075,0.6054,0.0006,4.6143,0.1689,0.0022,0.0003,1.1734,2.2398,0.2047,0.2045,2.5331,2.4721,4.5414,0.4121,0.7718,0.0228,4.5883,0.6768,0.7555,0.3992,3.8368,4.123,1.3549,3.7084,2.2702,5.5337,3.8334,4.3188,0.2363,5.4489,0.0201,5.1891,6.245,1.041,2.4199,1.8508,2.1821,0.0072,3.3676,2.2859,0.6621,5.0999,3.8426,3.512,0.0696,0.1167,5.2398,1.8272,0.8057,1.5506,4.3546,1.3389,0.2468,0.9537,2.0956,0.1416,5.0717,0.2076,2.7603,1.8466,0.102,2.7996,7.3898,3.6439,5.1293,3.4686,4.5393,4.9101,0.9046,3.1127,0.8101,2.5022,0.4554,1.8337,0.9975,0.0002,3.6752,6.126,4.7075,0.9059,1.6406,6.5581,1.2031,0.4074,0.041,1.3945,5.2175,4.0967,3.0503,3.0731,0.3358,0.3368,2.678,3.1036,4.2824,4.6412,1.7339,0.2361,5.0153,6.9322,2.1729,4.1351,1.9626,3.882,0.1094,0.0105,4.8704,2.1157,4.0733,0.9294,0.6241,1.5974,2.7235,0.8545,2.3993,3.774,0.7925,5.1005,4.4426,2.5741,0.2393,3.3962,2.5568,0.0813,0.2036,2.6578,3.8841,0.7673,0.5274,1.9441,5.7192,2.7804,3.2719,3.8254,1.9032,1.3962,0.9129,0.25,3.6137,3.4182,1.0107,1.4676,3.3348,3.2205,1.586,3.8486,2.0756,0.3981,1.5793,5.0929,3.0253,1.4844,4.9289,3.6022,2.5652,3.7244,0.051,1.5951,3.8287,1.7344,0.0739,0.0302,0.1152]}
{"id":4895,"ended":false,"length":665,"gen_text":"Smithfield is London's only major wholesale market ( Leadenhall Market nowadays attracting more tourist trade ) which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land, better transport links and more modern infrastructure. Its success in this regard is due not only to its commercial attractiveness but to its unique position as a public market with a rich history and character.\n\nThe market's story is one of hard work and persistence. In the early years after its opening in 1888, its stalls were largely dependent on the goodwill and generosity of the City and the National Gallery of Art, where they were seen as cultural havens. By the turn of the 20 th century it was considered so important that it had become self-governing; a position it remained for the final decades of the century with a strong mandate to protect and promote its heritage. Its last major regeneration was a large scale reconstruction of its East End area in the late 1980 s with the addition of several large houses and new hotels.\n\nSwansea East Market\n\nThe name, meaning 'East Market' in the Welsh language, probably comes from some of the stalls sold there by travellers passing through, or perhaps merchants buying and selling their wares on the way to market. Swansea itself was one of the most important markets in early modern England. It flourished in the 14 th century, and the first public market in England which was publically funded was established by the then city council in 1380. Over the centuries it was changed by various government intervention, especially in the mid 1800 s when it was sold in name to private interests and then sold again in the 1960 s to the state, with the last vestiges of the public market in Swansea being auctioned off in 1989.\n\nIts future lies in the hands of a new generation of public and private entrepreneurs but with an established and well-supported market centre in the heart of the city. It is a success story which provides valuable lessons for those who want to move cultural heritage assets out of the centre of the capital.\n\nFrom London\n\nMost of the major events which mark London's cultural heritage, such as exhibitions, performances and exhibitions, have their origins here, often in the city's streets and squares. One of the most prominent sites of heritage is Tate Modern (founded by Edwardian architect John Nash in 1857) which stands in one of the hottest districts in the world, South Bank. Its location at the centre of the London real estate market has ensured that over its history there is a steady flow of funds and investment from outside London into Tate Modern. This has kept it in the top ten most expensive museums in the world, with the 2012 sale of the building valued at \u00a35 billion. Tate Modern itself has more than 450 permanent exhibits and runs major events like the Tate Modern International Festival, the Tate Modern Festival of Glass (Festival of Glass) and Tate Modern's Biennial.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u00a3500 million was invested in Tate Modern between 1987 and 2008. A new visitor centre opened in 2009 which added new exhibits, guided tours and improved facilities, and opened in 2008.\n\nTate Modern also has a number of museums and galleries which are owned (including its extensive archives) and run by the Tate Trust itself.

{"id":4994,"ended":false,"length":626,"gen_text":"Wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order. He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, fearing and fearing the evils of the dark ages. The reformer worked tirelessly to improve the condition of women in England and urged other countries to do the same.\n\nWilliam Wilberforce was born on 12 May 1743 into a family with strong religious values. He was the third son of his father and Mary Wylie.\n\nWilliam and his parents were both poor, so William spent much of his early childhood travelling the country with his brother Thomas. The brothers always lived in shabby rooms in poor-quality lodgings, and were forced to work hard to support themselves with odd jobs. William's father, for one, worked at the local coal mine, making a considerable income in the process.\n\nOne of William's earliest memories is of begging and scrounging for survival. He suffered from tuberculosis and spent his youth in an asylum. Young William's parents separated when he was ten, during which time William grew very close to his younger brother Thomas. The years went by and William was given a scholarship to a grammar school in Coventry.\n\nWilliam went on to become very popular at school, where he made lots of friends. When he finished, he returned home and became head boy. In 1766 he became a member of the House of Commons, where he worked on civil legislation, particularly the Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. In 1768 the house voted to impeach the prime minister Edward Pitt, and to support William's proposed Reform Bill. William argued the case strenuously, and in 1769 Pitt was duly impeached and stripped of his position in the cabinet.\n\nWilliam did his ministerial duty well, and in 1770 he was made minister of foreign affairs. He became the first high official to meet George III before his death in 1783\n\nWilberforce's political ambition was apparent from his earliest days in Parliament, and he was elected to the East Anglian Association for the Suppression of the Slave Trade in 1778. He was elected to the East-Anglian Association three years later, and served as a member of parliament during his lifetime. There were accusations he had married off one of his friends.\n\nAfter his political career came to an end in 1781, William returned home to marry Catherine, daughter of Archibald Stewart of St Leonards in Cornwall. She died in 1782 with him, and he spent the rest of his days in poverty in the countryside. He was so ill he was frequently sick in his bed, and when he was eventually able to travel he slept on a straw mattress on the floor.\n\nIn all, William Wilberforce wrote 25 publications that appeared between 1776 and 1788. Among those was a book of sermons, The Sermon on the Mount, published in 1780. A new edition was published in 1842 in memory of the founder of the Anti-slavery Society.\n\nWilberforce died on 5 March 1808 of a pulmonary disease. There is plenty of good information on the origins of the cause of his death, but one interesting tidbit from William's health and medical records was that he developed arthritis in his legs.\n\nWilberforce also wrote two books on Christian charity\n\nFor more information on The Life of William Wilberforce visit my

{"id":3722,"ended":true,"length":664,"gen_text":"At some point in Isaac's youth, his father Abraham brought him to Mount Moriah. At God's command, Abraham was to build a sacrificial altar and sacrifice his son Isaac upon it. God told Isaac in the Lord's Prayer to sacrifice his child.\n\nIsaac did as instructed. After he did so, Abraham and the angel appeared to him in the woods. Abraham saw that the Lord's prayer was sincere. God then told him that Isaac was now his son and promised him to give him up in sacrifice on the altar he had built.\n\nAfter Abraham had returned to Mount Moriah, Isaac returned with his older brothers. On the altar were sacrifices of both of the younger Isaac's brothers, Esau and Jacob. Esau was to offer his younger brother, Ishmael, upon the altar. Jacob was to offer up his younger brother, Laban, upon the altar. Isaac remained with his brothers in the woods but soon found the time to visit and congratulate his father. He left, however, not before offering up his younger son, Isaac, upon the altar of the Lord.\n\nWhile he was still alone with his father, Jacob and Esau approached. Jacob wanted to know whether Isaac had told him of the Lord's prayer when he was at Mount Moriah. Isaac asked him to give him Esau, who was also his brother's son, and now had grown up. Esau had been his younger brother's son as well and Esau was now grown into manhood. Isaac had given him up in place of his younger brother as promised, and now he desired to know if Jacob would like him.\n\nJacob accepted Esau as his son; he loved him immensely, and Isaac was the sole reason He had done so. Jacob loved Isaac for his kindness and gentleness. One day, when all their brothers had gathered together, Isaac gave each of them a handful of flour. He told them to dip their fingers into the flour and make the sign of the cross. After they each dipped their fingers into the flour and made the sign of the cross, Esau, Jacob, and others left the company of their brothers, going to live in the wilderness. They named the land they would settle in Canaan after Isaac.\n\nSoon after, they built an altar in the forest and offered sacrifices of camels. When their father had returned, Isaac returned to Mount Moriah and gave his older brothers, the younger ones, to him. They now became Abraham's sons by birth.\n\nWhen Isaac and Esau, Jacob and Esau, returned to the tent of Moses to greet him, the Lord said, \"Where are they?\" Moses was puzzled, and so was Gabriel, the angel who spoke to him.\n\n\"Are they not with you?\" asked the Lord.\n\nWhen the Lord was finished speaking with Moses and Gabriel, he said to Moses, \"Take these two sons of Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael your brother, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with your rod, as your posterity in the land I give you.\"\n\nThen Moses cast his rod at the two boys' shoulders, and it became a rod of iron. The Lord's word was not in vain; the two boys became powerful nations on the earth.\n\nAbout five years later, the Lord took to Himself two sons of Isaac, named Ishmael and Isaac. This was in the days preceding the birth of Jesus of Nazareth.","token_len":709,"entropy":[4.583,0.1065,1.9155,12.1773,0.4181,4.335,0.2971,2.5111,1.8555,7.3782,6.486,0.7326,0.4845,5.1472,0.4915,0.0131,2.0143,3.9529,6.9815,0.0436,0.729,0.2636,0.8221,4.4029,1.5108,3.3204,0.9515,5.4085,0.0001,0.1442,1.6458,2.2405,1.3126,0.5937,0.1689,5.8365,0.0659,0.2688,3.4599,2.458,2.2588,5.6371,1.5479,4.121,0.108,0.0541,2.5384,2.6907,0.4901,3.8264,1.8579,2.1475,0.0207,2.0223,0.0008,3.1646,1.4037,2.824,1.2184,3.615,2.6993,2.9855,0.8284,0.1114,2.2652,2.5155,2.6675,1.249,4.31,0.4481,0.4535,1.8256,1.1669,5.4915,0.8793,1.1442,3.7673,1.6982,2.1351,3.0334,2.364,2.0603,0.8694,4.5369,0.9704,3.1169,1.6955,1.2505,1.5098,1.0221,2.486,1.0445,2.0375,2.1821,0.6095,1.6852,2.5721,2.169,3.4517,2.6295,0.1888,5.1545,2.9038,1.311,3.4376,0.6417,0.4678,4.3047,0.2628,0.3304,0.2392,0.9091,0.0002,2.9481,2.141,1.4208,4.0597,0.5144,0.9392,0.0007,0.0011,0.2276,1.7247,5.3759,2.357,0.7748,4.541,1.45,1.3668,5.0634,0.5511,1.9198,3.2477,4.6252,1.3781,3.3198,2.7754,2.5709,2.463,2.097,0.0565,0.4585,1.1277,2.5882,0.0007,0.0437,0.087,0.1898,3.6475,0.0003,0.7645,1.4118,4.1951,1.0328,1.3398,0.0745,1.141,3.8216,0.0024,0.0001,0.3352,4.266,0.1808,0.0699,0.6338,0.3793,0.5126,0.0986,0.4048,3.9468,0.0602,0.2634,0.1011,0.0915,1.8564,0.0001,0.9769,0.147,0.0826,0.0315,0.0336,2.8797,5.6291,1.6884,0.3501,0.7419,2.5427,0.2845,1.3181,5.4794,3.6755,4.6439,2.8716,1.9876,0.244,2.9675,4.095,6.4576,0.5361,0.3807,0.7709,2.4954,5.3816,3.4765,1.7413,0.0155,3.0539,1.4906,3.0881,1.5838,0.8347,0.8877,4.5729,0.4073,1.1414,1.0842,0.3678,0.0692,0.0445,2.8438,1.2404,0.8603,0.5027,0.3994,0.0002,4.474,3.4704,0.2063,3.0182,6.0622,1.3921,0.3904,0.2415,0.2788,3.6462,3.3773,0.4154,0.0003,2.9858,3.1728,1.7431,4.0181,0.2289,1.1592,3.7453,0.8174,1.9216,4.1644,1.0211,1.8704,1.3391,1.5986,0.0797,0.4232,4.2994,0.3803,1.4666,3.6012,0.8074,0.0012,0.0005,0.1303,0.5839,5.7688,2.0366,1.9418,4.0004,0.3388,4.6099,0.001,2.2372,2.6782,0.8747,4.1187,1.567,1.6339,2.5124,0.6209,1.2053,1.7531,6.2028,3.6816,3.3152,0.969,1.134,1.8396,0.0006,3.2032,2.413,4.2037,2.6827,0.0647,0.926,2.248,2.3768,0.0203,2.2939,4.6646,0.0014,1.2747,1.589,3.134,4.2736,1.7969,0.0187,0.2183,1.4004,3.8175,3.031,1.6873,0.7649,1.2638,5.6955,0.002,1.0818,0.879,0.1927,4.1891,3.8162,2.4763,0.8814,1.453,1.9241,4.3498,0.4093,3.5339,1.6116,0.9419,2.2507,5.5927,2.7666,3.1433,0.6733,0.0002,0.6152,3.6314,0.9707,0.0004,2.4944,0.3221,0.3431,5.5734,1.9777,2.8289,0.5759,6.3715,1.873,0.6385,3.7288,1.4405,2.9417,6.2775,0.8492,7.851,0.6626,3.1422,0.1581,0.0486,1.9067,3.758,1.4278,4.5656,0.91,3.5784,0.7901,3.0863,0.0012,1.1818,6.1319,0.3799,0.5929,2.1488,5.1107,4.5263,1.6098,0.7894,2.1348,1.3702,0.8679,1.1899,3.7949,5.3605,0.4533,0.3233,0.4474,4.5066,0.0034,2.9162,1.4709,1.2561,1.1755,0.4474,0.8171,4.5773,1.3136,0.5266,1.095,0.4317,0.1244,0.3821,2.784,3.3155,0.8943,0.0103,0.0255,0.2586,1.2318,3.6476,1.9028,5.2173,1.0237,0.1149,0.0955,0.6019,0.038,0.0285,2.2851,0.2227,0.0552,0.0163,0.3847,0.0041,0.0062,0.0556,4.0477,0.0002,2.9364,0.7286,0.2278,0.1231,5.3753,4.7762,0.6915,5.5907,0.8752,0.9252,0.1828,2.681,4.8595,1.2174,1.9827,1.3893,0.4818,0.442,0.7129,3.4019,3.8023,0.6015,2.8309,2.2697,3.4286,1.6918,2.2207,2.4877,1.4586,0.5514,0.4993,0.3545,0.0002,4.5132,0.6975,1.2893,3.7608,1.7079,2.3593,0.0087,1.6706,0.2044,5.126,1.1508,1.5674,0.7819,1.8268,6.1822,0.0027,2.2226,3.6327,2.7555,1.2076,4.0771,2.1682,1.3646,1.0531,5.0526,1.3083,1.2377,0.001,0.0003,1.7828,3.6726,1.6173,2.5892,0.7496,2.0939,4.8574,2.2745,2.4673,0.242,2.9642,1.2879,0.567,3.0571,4.6656,1.9997,3.3032,0.0583,0.7133,3.7141,1.5953,0.5926,1.0869,0.0002,2.9785,0.7753,3.7263,2.8045,0.0002,4.5337,2.7968,1.5746,1.5914,0.001,1.1205,4.0958,0.4258,1.2951,6.3995,0.4571,6.4992,4.3511,3.7971,0.4322,0.1972,2.4865,0.5054,2.1361,1.9026,0.1088,4.3239,0.4979,3.5572,0.6583,2.221,3.5347,3.3336,1.8297,1.3376,4.0892,0.8582,5.9284,1.3625,0.9455,0.9878,0.716,1.8666,0.7252,0.9562,0.2097,1.8869,0.0002,1.0868,4.0584,0.2776,0.7427,0.2271,0.2197,0.3117,1.9127,1.4623,0.0253,0.0522,0.6663,0.0002,4.7482,1.4014,0.7135,3.3511,1.2658,0.1826,0.7118,0.2982,2.298,0.1344,0.0465,0.85,2.4605,0.6658,0.7332,0.1164,0.0311,2.2707,2.1594,0.6615,0.8959,0.0085,4.6104,1.1806,0.3305,0.1668,1.2745,0.0076,0.0001,3.6694,1.5875,0.1107,0.1526,0.6683,1.554,0.1733,0.0202,0.1266,0.0026,0.0006,0.0305,2.3344,1.3012,3.7009,1.0411,2.118,1.5619,5.2976,0.0007,3.2941,0.6077,0.139,0.7444,2.6908,0.0445,0.9039,0.5221,0.0002,3.445,0.8238,6.2866,1.1696,0.0818,1.0076,0.2612,1.1945,1.8117,3.9461,2.1716,1.0062,0.3579,2.7535,0.1566,0.1302,4.285,0.0185,2.1104,0.261,2.8144,0.5073,4.3456,3.8188,1.158,5.219,1.0938,0.5248,1.5221,1.1668,1.3363,0.9442,0.6123,4.1014,1.7855,4.5436,0.2755,1.0108,0.2401,0.6495,0.0002,5.142,1.548,2.1124,0.7842,0.0921,1.8689,0.4613,5.4131,4.117,0.4994,1.7773,1.1231,0.3376,1.9696,0.9778,3.7688,0.3716,0.0042,0.0001,0.1083,1.2437,0.4291,5.077,1.097,3.0834,1.8045,1.027,5.4203,0.1372,1.219,0.0044,1.91,4.0578,0.0014,0.0001,0.2705]}
{"id":3284,"ended":true,"length":661,"gen_text":"The Mekong River remained free of dams until 1993 because of its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course of some of its branches.\n\nHowever, in the 1960s new dams were built to deliver drinking water to the growing population of China. Many have been built on the Mekong River, and the water levels in the two biggest of them have risen quickly.\n\n\"With the increase in water levels, so [has] the level of pollution,\" says Dr. Hong. \"When the rivers flow at low flow-rate, such as in the river bed behind the dams, you have so much dissolved solids in the water. The river water pollution contributes to downstream river ecosystem effects.\"\n\nBy 2006, the Mekong River basin had one of Asia's highest levels of water pollutants: 471 microliters (\u00b5L) of mercury was released into the air for every 1 cubic meter of river flow. China releases about half of its water pollution to China's waterways. Other Asian rivers, such as the Yellow Sea during the Gulf Stream, also have significantly more pollution than India's.\n\nBut the river pollution in China is not necessarily just a by-product of growth. The pollution is partly to blame for China's health concerns.\n\nIn the first 10 years of its Communist rule (1972-76), China had the highest infant mortality rate in Asia, with more than 400,000 deaths each year.\n\nEven as today the country's life expectancy in China is higher than that of Mexico, many diseases such as heart disease and cancer are widespread and many people can't afford timely medical treatment.\n\nIt is estimated that in just 15 years, the birth rate in China will have peaked, meaning millions of children will die prematurely at an age when they should be in the prime of life.\n\n\"According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission's statistics, China's infant mortality rate for 2007 will be the highest among the 34 members of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), above Japan, Italy, Canada, and Germany,\" reports the South China Morning Post.\n\nBut the river pollution problem has only begun.\n\n\"The health and environment of the Mekong River also affect downstream people in Asia, and also negatively impact upstream people,\" says Dr. Hong. \"We can't afford for people downstream living in poor ecological environments, with little water to wash their clothes and to live with polluted waters.\" Even today, the Mekong is suffering from an outbreak of intestinal parasites.\n\nFor people who are not directly affected by the river pollution, the damage it causes is evident. It is estimated that of more than 8,000 species of fish that live along the two river basins, only 1,000 live in the Mekong River and only 200 in the Yellow River basin. \"It is estimated that over 80% of the river water is polluted,\" says Dr. Hong, \"but the amount of water that we use to clean the river water by hand, for washing cars, or making the river water look clean, is very

{"id":3021,"ended":false,"length":577,"gen_text":"The dusky dolphin, protected in much of its range, is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because ; ``... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available information '''\n\nIn the Atlantic Ocean\n\n\nIt is the Atlantic species most closely related to the Dusky dolphin, having also been observed in the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean Gulf and off the eastern coast of America. The species is also listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because ; `` The overall population is well documented, and the information available suggests that it is stable and increasing, however, no significant estimates of population dynamics have been made. This species will need further sampling of available habitats and detailed surveys of habitats to assess habitat use and viability ` `. If present trend trends continue, this species is expected to meet IUCN Criteria for Critically Endangered in four to five years ` `. It has little prospect of recovery after that ` ` ` '\n\nIn the Pacific\n\n\nIn the Pacific, the species is believed to have declined due to overfishing, pollution and illegal fishing for fins. Currently there is no assessment of its species status, but it is known to occur from the western coast of the North Pacific Ocean to the southeastern coast of South America. From the northwest portion of its range, it is present near the southern California, Florida and Gulf Coasts, and beyond there is little information. However, if the trends observed in the Atlantic persist and are sustained, it is believed that there could be a threat to this species because, following that species as they migrate north past the southern coasts of Mexico, Florida and the southwestern United States, they could collide with the Mexican basking sharks - the main consumers of the whale shark. If this happened, it would be likely to cause major mortality of both the whale shark and the dusky dolphin.\n\nReferences\n\nMorton, R, F.A. Kooijman, R.E. Fenske, R. V. Smith, P.

{"id":3413,"ended":true,"length":625,"gen_text":"The ship saw action during the Russo @ - @ Turkish War of 1877 \u2013 88. She spent the war in the Black Sea squadron. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, sunk three of the ships of the squadron.\nIt was the last time the battleship USS 'Savage' would spend the winter season in the Black Sea. She was commissioned in 1921 as part of the Pennsylvania Navy Fleet.\nShe is now owned by the United States Navy after being stricken from the fleet.\nHer last wartime commission was as SS 'Kestrel' from 1920-26, and in 1921 she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. On 6 December 1927 SS 'Kestrel' and the rest of her old fleet were struck by a torpedo fired by an unseen German submarine from a position near Algiers.\nWith the loss of more than 80 ships in the first five weeks, the Mediterranean Fleet was reduced to 18 ships. The ship had the largest bomb capacity and the most powerful guns. As part of the Italian effort to end the war, she was assigned to the Libyan naval squadron for operations against Tripoli in southern Tunisia, the Libyan coastal defenses and the Dardanelles.\nSS Kestrel spent the last two months of the war attempting to break through the Turkish lines of defense in North Africa through the Bizerte region, which was under French command at the time. After losing five ships, she was finally defeated. On the 6th of January 1928 she was lost in a fire which had started in a turret room.\nAfter that incident as well, the Navy decided that she had been badly damaged and too late to be salvaged.\u00a0 It has been reported that she was in rough shape and was left in the Mediterranean without any spare parts, as she had sailed long distance from her U. P. homeport in Philadelphia to Malta in order to visit a U. S. national in her absence.\nShe was finally sold at auction on April 6, 1929 for over $200. The only thing that she had left was her two 8.2 inch Dahlgren cannon.\nIn April of 1950 she was towed to a saltwater site in the bay of Almar. Two years later she was completely scrapped at the ship yard in North Chicago. The hull was re-floated and the gun turrets were removed. The engine room has since been turned into a fish hatchery.\nIt was built as a hospital ship in 1913 and converted into a hospital ship in 1913.\nIn December of 1924 the hospital ship 'Savage, U.S.S. 'Savage', in the Black Sea. She was then commanded by Lieutenant Joseph E. O'Sullivan, U.S.N\nBuilt at John E. Taylor Shipbuilding Co., Wilmington, Del. She took part in the Russo -Japanese War of 1904-05, the Russo -Turkish War of 1877-1878, the Russo-African War of 1899-1902, and the Suez War of 1956. During World War One she was the flagship of U.S. Forces in the Mediterranean (the Mediterranean Fleet). After the war she served in the Philippines, Panama (including two deployments as the Pacific fleet's flagship), and as a hospital ship in the Caribbean.

{"id":1163,"ended":false,"length":626,"gen_text":"Boise National Forest is home to three of Idaho's scenic byways, all of which are paved highways accessible to < unk > vehicles. The Payette River Scenic Byway is an 80 @ 50 mile gravel road that snakes through rugged pine forests and mountains. The Scenic Byway connects east of Boise with south Idaho < unk >. Along the way visitors experience the beauty of the < unk > Scenic West, where the majestic Cascade Mountains meet the < unk > Cascades of the Columbia River. The < unk > Cascades National Monument is the largest national park in Montana < unk >. It has one of the biggest remaining examples of < unk > old-growth forest on planet Earth. The Idaho Perennial Garden & Scenic Byway, which traverses eight counties, is the state's most scenic scenic road. This paved four-lane paved road is the second longest in Idaho < unk > and connects east to west, providing a beautiful route through the state's beautiful, < unk > sage scrub desert.\n\nBoise National Forest has the second largest national forest in Idaho. It contains nearly 60 separate forest units and spans several valleys. As forest areas change through the year, they are classified as < unk > open or closed. Open < unk > areas give the public free access to the forest for public recreation, with only a few conditions. < unk > closed groups, however, may go on a limited number of access times, usually twice a year at weekends and two days a month. The Forest Service < unk > maintains a system of maps, guides and regulations.\n\nBoise National Forest is the oldest National Forest in the < unk > United States. The first permanent permanent residents were early American explorers who named the forest after its founder, a French fur trader in the 1800s. The forest was declared a national forest in 1933. Today hundreds of citizens from Idaho, Montana, Washington, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Wyoming and Montana volunteer to maintain the forest. In the 1930's, an irrigation project was built near the town of < unk > Coeur d'Alene. This project damaged the surrounding forest. Today, the Coeur d'Alene watershed is a buffer between snowmelt and the Boise River. The Boise River drains the valley from Coeur d'Alene along with the Colorado River, which feeds the Boise River to the ocean. Boise is a gateway to the scenic Idaho < unk > Rocky Mountain National Park, which is accessible to the National Park Service only during the summer months.\n\nIf you are planning a hike in the area, you may want to consider visiting the recreation areas at Cascade Locks and Mount Pocatello. We offer more information on these places.\n\nBoise River State Recreation Area\n\nBoise River State Recreation Area (RRSA) was established on August 15, 1957, approximately 100 years after the first pioneers arrived in Idaho in search of gold. The RRSA has been listed by the National Park Service as one of the National Parks of Special Scientific Interest.

{"id":4701,"ended":false,"length":519,"gen_text":"Carnotaurus is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear ; several interpretations have revolved around use in battle or as a display in the male's repertoire of displays (e.g., display-based displays; Roney, 1996). However, we are not aware of any evidence for male display usage of the horned skull on the Carnotaurus specimen.\n\nThere are no other known specimens of Carnotaurus.\n\nKey Terms\n\nBipedalism bipedalism; bipedalism equivocating between the term 'bipedalism' and 'rankeption', and various other expressions\n\nColouration colouration; colour, with differences such as patterns of spots, brown or white spots, blue or grey stripes, green or brown patterns, brown, green, blue, patterned or non-patterned\n\nDimensions lengths or weight dimension and weight; length (in meters) and volume (in liters)\n\nExoskeleton exoskeleton; the soft tissues of a carcass; usually the bones in the upper body and head, but also the ribs, vertebrae, ribs, sternum, limbs, tail (including pelvis, femur, tibia, fibula, tarsus, tarsus longus, metatarsus, pelvis femur), hindmost leg, skull, vertebra and teeth; also the associated soft tissues (e.g., intestines, brain, heart, lung, skin, eyes, nerves, tendons, muscles) and\/or nerves, cartilage, synovium, subcutaneous tissue, synovial bone, fibrous sinews, integument, trachea, epiglottis and\/or nasal passages; in the Carnotaurus skull there is a prominent ossified, oval tooth socket in the upper mandible; the teeth on Carnotaurus (right) are small. Exoskeleton morphology; the skeleton form\n\nGrip strength flexion\/extension, grasping or grasping strength; the strength of a hand, or of any grasping apparatus\n\nLocomotion locomotion\n\nMaintenance dentition\n\nMotion (or movement) locomotion, moving\n\nOrgan systems brain, autonomic function, nervous system\n\nPseudoceratosauria pseudoceratosauria; species lacking a paired cervical vertebra (but including some more primitive forms); include T. rex with and, and Rhinoceratops\n\nSauropod Sauropod; a predatory marine reptile\n\nSpines spines and claws of prey, especially mammals; for example, the long spine that runs from the throat all the way to the tail (not present in the Carnotaurus skull) and the spines on the forelimb used by most carnivorous lizards; they also have specialized adaptations that enable them to climb trees\n\nTail feathers; the feathers on the tail (except in the Carnotaurus example, in which there are bony spurs) of most

{"id":3623,"ended":false,"length":629,"gen_text":"National legislation for amendment of the Controlled Substances Act to place salvinorin A and Salvia divinorum in Schedule I at the federal level in the United States was proposed in 2002 by Representative Joe Baca, and reintroduced in 2003 by Representative Patrick Kennedy.[4] The legislation failed to pass because of Republican opposition. Baca did propose an amendment to the Controlled Substances Act in April 2003, which could have allowed the sale of pure salvia divinorum under certain circumstances.\n\nThe 2003 law proposed to classify salvia divinorum under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and placed it under the same scrutiny that drugs such as peyote and psilocybin possessed under federal law. This could have had a positive effect for salvia since it could have been used legally. However, in an attempt to meet a deadline on legislation, a law enforcement crackdown commenced in 2004. The DEA began seizing shipments of salvia from across the country. The seizures ranged from dozens to hundreds and led many local law enforcement agencies to cease their research. The DEA also investigated and blocked a second project to grow salsalate.[5] This may have hurt the ability of law enforcement and the scientific community to study and research salvia divinorum.\n\nOther attempts to classify salvia were undertaken during 2004, 2006, and 2007 through the Drug Free America Act, which was passed in 2008 with bipartisan support.[6] It would have decriminalized the possession of salvia without requiring a DEA license. However, the bill stalled in 2009 at the end of the last Congress. The U.S. Senate passed the House Resolution of Support for Research and Scientific Inquiry into Salvia,[7] but the House bill did not get the necessary 15 votes needed to pass the Senate. In February 2010, the Senate voted by a wide margin to re-introduce a bill in the 113th Congress that included a provision that would decriminalize the possession of Schedule I drugs. At this time, the House failed to take up the Senate bill. In June 2011, a coalition of marijuana-legalization groups including the Marijuana Policy Project, Americans for Safe Access, NORML, Marijuana Policy Project, Drug Policy Alliance, Drug Policy Revolt, and United for Care began lobbying Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to again take up the bill, which passed in February 2014 with a large bipartisan majority.[8]\n\nDespite this progress for Salvia divinorum, attempts to decriminalize the drug continue. On August 26, 2016, the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 2730, the \"American Kratom Act.\" This bill was in response to an inquiry from Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) that was introduced by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) in March 2016. The inquiry inquired as to what federal statutes prohibit the cultivation of kratom under federal law. The House's \"American Kratom Act\" was designed to preempt this inquiries.[9]\n\nThe bill states: \"the plant kratom, in any form, is the official substance of the United States government, under Section 7606 of Title 21 of the United States Code.

{"id":3173,"ended":true,"length":647,"gen_text":"The episode progresses mostly through footage streamed from a fixed camera in booth nine of the call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed on the side of the screen, in the next booth over, in the one below that and in the one above that\n\nThe audience is able to make up their own minds on how to vote.\n\nWhen the episode is about 12 minutes long, the show then ends and we move on to the next episode.\n\nThe live voting process is simple.\n\nA group of five fans enter the room where the cast and producers are, and the four of them vote together. The five fans are then told which song the four of them chose.\n\nWhen the song is chosen, we are told to click 'check the results' which takes you to a screen where you can see a number of polls being presented to the audience. These polls are simple. The easiest is simply to click the'select your winner' button and the producers give the fans their choice, and again the fans can vote by clicking on who they have made their choice.\n\nAs you can see here, the producers in this case have given the audience their choice for the third place.\n\n\nNext up, the fan votes from that group are translated into a number of percentages where they translate through the various different ballots: 5% for the first place, 8% for second, 11% for third place, 15% for the bonus, and 20% for the fans vote.\n\n\nWe then see a simple graph showing the fans that voted as they did. They are represented graphically, with the red\/green line showing the percentage that they voted for their number one pick.\n\n\nThis is repeated the rest of the way up, so in effect we see the percentage that each song has received when the fans all have the vote.\n\nThis graph is then translated into the final result.\n\nThe vote for the song is then tallied for each of the five fans, with the ones with the highest number of points being counted as the winners of the song.\n\nThe final song is then sung in the studio by the group, with the video from stage being played on the side of the TV screen, so that the audience can watch.\n\nThis has been part of the show since February 8th, with a total of 466 votes registered. The winners for each song can be viewed, on the fan's pages, but I am now going to ignore the three winners of the final song.\n\nThese three, along with the first couple of songs, were chosen in the order that they were named by the fans.

{"id":4888,"ended":true,"length":670,"gen_text":"In 1123, the area near Aldersgate was granted by King Henry I for the foundation of St Bartholomew's Priory at the request of Prior < unk > in thanks for his being nursed back to health by that pious and holy man. Before the King's conquest of Mercia in 1274, the whole of the north of England was claimed by the king to be his, not a part of the kingdom. In 1279, after the conquest was complete, the northern half was incorporated into the kingdom.\n\nIt is a very good story and quite true enough. However, it is interesting to ponder the fact that, after being settled by Franciscan monks, the area was named the \"Monastery of St Peter\". Some years later, William the Conqueror gave this area to his brother, Edward, as a gift. The reason was that he was afraid that another brother would try to wrest the English throne back from him. In a later campaign during the Hundred Years' War, the local people sided with Edward, and there was a clash between the two sides. After this event some of the men from the monastery were arrested and later executed for their supposed loyalty to William. A church was erected to the holy men who had died during the conflict. Later, when Charles II inherited the throne, he put the chapel to one side. When Edward III, also the last French king, invaded England in 1327, the site had been ransacked by the victorious army and looted. The chapel is believed to have been destroyed by the invading English forces. It remains that way as a memorial to Edward III. William of Malmesbury wrote a letter explaining why he named the place as the \"Monastery of St Peter, \" and also the reason for his refusal to surrender it to the king. I should like to know more about this little tale!\n\nThe shrine was used as a prison during crusades (as in the case of Simon Lomax ), and was also used as the execution ground over the burning of Jewish men in 1390 and 1394. It was used as the execution grounds for the \"Black Death\" of 1446. Later, Pope Paul VI was held hostage from one of the nuns when the French invaded the island of Sainte Marie (near Malmesbury). When the French army was driven back, Saint Jean Lourdes entered the French camp with the help of a man who she gave his name as Peter the Hermit. He was later to die defending her during the Battle of Poitiers in 1516. On his body was carved \"Qui abesse eum ab omni eum\", the translation being \"Who knows if they will endure\". It seems Peter the Hermit, himself, died at Quirgeshire during a very violent storm, like a storm we have today (not so many lightning strikes today!). According to the Roman Catholic Encyclopedia \"the English bishop Odo was also forced to leave the island, the reason for which is unknown, since he was murdered by French soldiers\".\n\nWhen the Church of St Peter was set on fire on 13 September 1667, it was the first event of massive violence that happened in Britain on that date. It was the worst single loss of life in British history. It also was the first time when British people began to see themselves as the \"English\", not French or German. So, St Paul's chapel was a good site to commemorate the time when the English finally became the people of England.","token_len":715,"entropy":[7.8062,6.4332,0.6933,1.3581,6.989,5.88,8.1831,3.2559,3.3365,1.3909,6.23,3.0897,1.3113,2.4919,1.4791,3.712,0.7441,6.7114,0.0205,3.2748,3.9494,0.0122,0.0045,0.0886,6.2092,0.0001,5.6455,1.8945,3.6833,0.0052,9.2138,12.1908,12.2052,1.9575,0.9778,5.0227,8.1704,0.1021,0.883,8.4018,9.927,0.0019,1.0446,0.0796,0.0228,1.3573,4.715,4.7829,2.4535,3.0151,0.7464,0.5547,6.2352,1.1446,5.4542,0.8895,5.3556,0.6399,6.2273,0.001,1.2372,1.7166,3.4917,0.1572,0.888,5.2815,0.5172,1.0547,4.0479,0.5748,0.4019,0.5715,4.8964,0.5207,0.4801,2.223,4.8683,0.1995,0.7721,1.8948,4.7893,3.8373,1.8508,0.037,0.542,1.6737,1.1586,2.5454,0.8435,3.5422,0.3283,3.6139,0.791,2.5907,5.3219,0.5934,0.1261,0.7303,4.5193,1.6547,1.1441,3.3923,0.4596,0.239,0.8092,1.4672,1.7824,0.0387,4.254,1.0408,3.4582,2.901,4.1865,4.2646,2.0633,4.4814,3.0923,6.3154,0.8871,1.953,0.1388,1.7022,0.8706,5.2529,0.3304,6.6416,1.6709,2.3172,0.0244,3.4482,3.7339,4.284,4.4634,0.9194,6.4144,0.2505,0.5251,0.485,0.6306,0.777,1.6598,1.3647,4.3588,3.4965,1.6334,4.025,0.4605,0.2276,0.7319,4.4669,1.7297,5.4602,3.0215,0.4787,0.2385,4.9437,1.234,0.0303,0.0016,3.9302,3.154,1.2964,0.571,1.9598,2.2099,0.9756,2.154,1.2511,2.8786,0.6544,1.181,0.9593,2.4182,3.8097,2.5699,0.7517,1.8105,1.7059,3.2231,0.4793,5.2934,2.8934,1.4819,2.9021,0.1082,4.6266,0.9011,6.6499,0.7303,3.9972,0.121,0.4698,0.4833,3.1937,4.0431,2.6606,5.0377,6.0094,0.466,1.6244,0.019,0.8268,0.0305,0.2437,2.0497,5.881,2.9515,5.6204,0.0504,1.3761,1.6127,1.143,5.3224,0.7363,0.8617,5.065,0.8251,0.6748,0.9083,2.8792,0.6267,3.5268,2.0875,3.2317,6.8315,1.0354,0.1176,3.5992,2.0431,0.5675,0.9437,1.0262,4.3165,0.5653,3.5909,1.3776,2.5568,1.5104,4.0779,2.8175,0.0888,3.0976,0.4547,4.6136,4.8815,0.6644,2.5985,2.7284,1.381,6.7969,2.2117,2.606,1.4523,1.152,3.2039,0.4969,1.108,0.4912,4.2989,0.736,2.4231,4.8908,1.578,4.8286,0.1408,0.1844,0.3756,0.6887,5.5579,1.2275,4.4745,1.6439,2.828,0.7196,2.0569,4.0481,2.9011,1.9268,3.6585,4.7387,2.4943,2.9517,6.3426,0.2992,0.6555,4.167,0.3112,0.5633,1.3285,0.6518,0.1232,1.4081,4.6411,4.6546,1.5375,5.4944,2.7604,0.0063,1.6328,0.8018,4.5603,2.3681,0.9664,4.7337,0.4503,1.5364,1.4874,4.6815,3.2493,0.0384,0.1925,0.1199,1.4097,1.6202,0.8259,2.7068,1.8819,1.9786,0.5245,2.5567,5.0152,6.2186,0.2085,5.0326,0.915,1.7201,0.2734,5.2468,0.3163,1.5543,6.6755,2.2681,0.8538,0.0052,0.0002,2.9317,1.6501,2.4426,5.476,2.178,0.6748,3.7346,0.4028,2.535,3.6333,1.4341,0.5977,0.5544,0.0064,0.0222,0.1562,0.1256,5.3937,2.8526,2.7489,3.9516,3.2799,1.4141,1.435,1.8987,4.1353,0.0836,4.6415,1.131,0.3349,0.6798,1.9087,0.5884,5.4009,4.9729,0.7158,0.0348,1.9809,2.2236,0.1359,0.5288,4.2732,4.2091,3.1043,0.4498,0.0002,2.0912,5.6503,2.5038,5.1918,1.0066,0.177,2.1108,1.5818,7.9001,0.1656,3.5189,5.1614,3.4634,1.0049,2.2492,0.1284,5.4708,6.419,3.9613,1.2599,7.1167,1.0181,2.0,1.9679,0.5982,0.5923,3.2538,4.81,1.5714,8.276,0.6149,5.9581,0.1661,5.9205,2.7297,1.8234,2.6476,3.7832,3.8002,0.8784,2.225,0.3379,2.13,0.5862,2.4214,0.7368,2.2878,3.1981,2.5919,1.2206,1.3206,4.4984,2.9915,0.1877,0.1911,2.5327,2.1754,4.0871,1.259,4.6467,0.7349,6.0236,2.7517,2.2651,3.6706,4.1683,2.5292,4.9621,5.5636,0.1959,0.3226,3.3238,4.5643,2.0744,3.5935,2.3508,1.6863,4.2775,1.5871,5.4078,0.4442,0.0327,1.8611,3.0355,4.024,4.3468,0.2399,0.0004,1.462,3.7428,0.816,1.6543,2.7739,1.9077,2.7055,1.913,0.8164,5.5453,5.9616,4.4185,5.6069,0.1574,5.9707,0.1873,5.5485,0.5398,3.0144,1.6539,2.1033,0.008,1.6906,5.3773,1.4542,4.8855,5.2526,3.4446,0.2859,0.6251,5.1955,3.156,0.2139,0.0006,0.4448,1.7747,1.5879,2.7944,5.3059,3.7529,5.5925,2.8765,3.6339,0.2177,2.2183,0.0052,1.2537,0.0587,0.004,1.099,1.5089,5.1085,0.1487,5.1893,2.6815,3.9716,1.236,4.0181,3.2051,4.3599,1.0374,5.2583,4.1448,4.7304,2.9553,4.8655,2.5183,0.1439,5.1955,2.9872,2.9638,3.9915,4.9549,1.8962,0.5491,1.4462,3.3065,2.9597,5.0214,0.9944,5.6204,1.5014,3.3358,2.734,6.0903,1.4684,0.006,0.0001,3.9566,5.9988,0.8162,3.4285,3.2387,7.015,3.3577,6.4511,6.5018,3.6788,2.5606,5.6963,2.1986,0.6414,2.116,5.8198,2.0677,2.0342,4.4955,1.7508,1.5495,4.3845,4.7076,3.6279,3.6395,4.4395,0.4696,3.2039,1.7395,4.8025,0.004,1.5189,5.8449,0.3943,1.8759,4.1194,2.9091,5.7538,5.3577,6.2312,0.1644,2.856,3.1153,5.673,0.1951,2.7101,1.1842,0.8611,2.7144,4.6564,2.9101,1.4567,0.6743,0.7426,1.4961,1.3768,4.289,1.119,1.2886,4.9174,1.5279,4.1936,0.7174,2.0968,0.9362,0.0001,4.5056,1.0603,4.6298,0.3709,0.9875,0.5202,0.4439,6.0729,1.3117,0.0069,2.4254,4.0033,2.9269,2.6004,4.5644,0.449,1.5176,0.5394,1.7973,1.1233,6.3468,0.7413,7.4194,4.1777,2.2053,3.5276,0.5927,3.0011,4.3963,1.2825,0.7034,0.3437,1.9792,0.7462,1.7185,3.1133,2.0538,3.8961,0.0974,0.0826,0.5282,1.644,0.1924,1.0986,2.3874,4.2946,2.1052,0.285,0.8062,1.4218,3.8284,3.9885,3.3999,3.7426,0.1612,3.5342,1.7687,0.2164,2.5608,2.9497,3.7025,2.3144,2.0621,5.2965,1.4154,1.8498,0.4547,5.8713,1.1119,4.8491,4.4514,0.2898,4.8228,1.1083,2.9953,4.6147,4.1114,1.2442,2.647,0.7831,5.6466,0.8012,1.0873,1.1883,5.0397,1.9228,1.2617,3.583,1.2221,0.8282,0.657]}
{"id":139,"ended":false,"length":599,"gen_text":"The producers considered Danny Denzongpa for the role of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's < unk > ( 1975 ) and < unk > (1976), both produced by B.G. Bose. Bose was known for directing films like < unk > (1975-76), < unk > (1977), < unk > (1980), < unk > [1979] (1980 and 1981), < unk> [1990] (1980, 1981) and < unk > (1992). In < unk > (1995) he was accompanied with two other actors: L.F. Wong and Anoop Kishan for the final scene.\n\nBose worked twice on this film, for one day and later on. As a director, he was extremely good at his style, which was simple with little dialogue and scenes, but it also required the actors to work and communicate with each other. As a cameraman, he was very efficient, which made him efficient, so some of the scenes were easy to shoot. In fact, for a film like this, when the characters become so small in a film, like Gabbar Singh, it is quite hard to use full-length lens, because the actors might not be able to move properly, which is obvious from the film. He had to use lenses which did not focus on characters properly, without any stabilization and which had a very low maximum aperture. The lenses had a long minimum focal length due to that fact as they had to focus on small characters. The lenses were heavy and it was very difficult for him to use the very heavy lenses with the tiny, small lens. The lens had a very good shape and was light and compact, but with an optical viewfinder, which made the movie very sharp.\n\nDuring the production of < unk > (1995) Bose managed to work closely with Anoop Kishan (1981), whose name was also used in this film for shooting, and with L.F. Wong, whose name is also mentioned in the same movie. Bose had some contacts in the Hong Kong film industry. Two of the crew of the < unk > (1996) are still alive.\n\nHis directing experience was limited to < unk > (1976) and < unk > (1982). On another occasion, he edited a film, but we will not mention its title now. The directors B.S. Meena (1992) and B.G. Bose (1975, 1976) were both in the film industry. Bose was also present on one occasion when director B.S. Meena met with the main cast for filming.

{"id":3541,"ended":true,"length":657,"gen_text":"On 17 February 1895 Nansen began a farewell letter to his wife, Eva, writing that should he come to grief `` you will know that your image will be the last I see your father's beautiful face in the whole world.''\nIt was the last time Nansen saw his daughter and son-in-law together.\nOn the morning of the 19th, he set off towards the coast with an armed escort.\nWith Nansen at his side he set off and when the light at Pangra Pass on the mainland was lessening he looked at the map placed between his hands and made a note to have his men return to the Cape of Good Hope before nightfall.\nHe stopped for a rest on a large beach where he could rest with ease. A few minutes later his aide Albertson arrived with orders to search for the ship while another pair were sent to pick up some prisoners.\nAt first, the lookout spotted nothing.\nThe two men did not find anything. As they approached there was suddenly a loud rumble and a huge cloud of smoke.\nNansen ordered his men to abandon ship, but not before telling them that their ship had been attacked by pirates on a coast a few miles away.\nHe ordered them to hide on shore, but not before ordering the gun to fire. His aide, who was also killed by a gunshot wound, was only twenty-one.\nMeanwhile, the lookout's note was found by a merchant from Kortlandt on the coast and it was read in detail.\nNansen then decided to sail north past Pangra Pass, but this did not work out due to bad weather. It was dark at that time and he therefore went back to the Cape of Good Hope on the 21st.\nThen, after having been at sea for a little more than a month, he was attacked by a violent gale with waves reaching sixty feet high.\nNansen had to make one of the greatest efforts ever undertaken over a short period of time in order to save his ship.\nThe ship was about forty miles off Kortlandt when he left the Cape of Good Hope, about one month earlier.\nThere were about eight survivors from three ships in the group and they left with Nansen's ship without even a scratch.\nThe news of Nansen's heroic act spread rapidly. That night, the newspapers in Copenhagen were full of his story and on the next day, 10 February 1895, there was a huge public meeting in Copenhagen to praise the hero's actions.\nNansen did not live to enjoy his high level of fame however, as he was killed by a blow from one of his own men after he had attempted to save a group of Portuguese fishermen who had landed on the coast two days before.\nAs the newspaper reports attest, the admiral's action became a famous example of heroism.\nAt the end of her life, Admiral Nansen was a hero to the people, famous in his home country and praised in a way no contemporary Danish hero in the seventeenth century was even acknowledged. He served in the Danish Navy until his dying day and was honored with a national commemoration (including a huge national frieze outside the Parliament) when he died in 1902.\nToday it can no longer be said that the Danish were no longer known to the world because they died a long time ago.

{"id":825,"ended":true,"length":655,"gen_text":"On 25 January 2010, the morning of Park's 66th birthday, he was found hanged and unconscious in his prison cell in Garth Prison, and pronounced dead at the scene later in the morning.\n\nEarly the next morning, the Seoul Central District Court ordered investigation into his death. Prosecutors requested that the probe also include the death of Park's former girlfriend, Choi Soon-sil, and other people who have been involved with Park.\n\nThere were no other suicides and homicides of any kind.\n\nPark and Soon-sil had a tumultuous relationship. Park and her family were concerned that rumors that Park had fathered a child through a surrogate (there was no proof of this) could have hurt her case.\n\nOn April 2, 2010, shortly before the birth of their daughter, Park made a post on her personal website, warning that she would be moving away from Seoul in early May. She also mentioned that after she moved, her cellmates would no longer be able to speak with her, and there would be a change in the rules.\n\nPark made some of the comments about the alleged surrogate pregnancy during a telephone interview with a television host and on a newspaper cover. The reports said that Park had told the TV host that she had been \"shaken\" by the fact that the media might report her affair with Soon-sil.\n\nOn June 4, 2010, Park moved into the apartment she shared with her boyfriend in the Rokkang District of Seoul. On June 7, Park had planned to leave Seoul because of her new responsibilities as head of the presidential office.\n\nWhen she did leave for her new duties, she reportedly told her cellmate that she would be visiting her parents and friends in Daegu, and would return after visiting Park's parents in Gangnam at the beginning of August.\n\nShe also apparently talked about having returned to Pyongyang on her arrival in Daegu, but that may not be true. On July 26, Park canceled her return to Daegu during her time there.\n\nPark's death raised questions about the possibility that Seoul authorities colluded with Soon-sil to end Park's own life. A few days after Park's death, prosecutors decided to investigate her relationship with Soon-sil, but did not disclose the findings of their investigation.\n\nIn August, President Lee Myung Bak announced several important changes to criminal procedures in dealing with crimes against a female, including the creation of a sexual assault unit to help solve sex crimes in general.\n\nPark's family had previously criticized the president over perceived attempts to cover up for Park in the Choi Soon-sil case. Park's mother also filed a complaint with prosecutors about President Lee for allegedly violating the country's constitution \u2014 the Sewol ferry disaster \u2014 by refusing to acknowledge the results of a commission report on the incident.\n\nIn December 2011, shortly before leaving office, Lee told her predecessor, former President Roh Moo-hyun, that she was considering seeking a presidential pardon in a way that would allow her family the opportunity to see their youngest daughter, Kim Yeo-jong, safely return to the United States to face trial.

{"id":2899,"ended":true,"length":674,"gen_text":"While pitching at Cedarcroft, Pennock threw a no @ - @ hitter to catcher Earle Mack, the son of Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, in 1910. Pennock agreed to let Mack hit in exchange for the no walk and passed. The home run was his last in the big leagues. Connie did let him know that the player didn't have to be a slugger as long as he pitched well. Pennock would make three more appearances for Philadelphia before his first game with the New York Mets in September, and the home run was still waiting for him when he was named to the roster for the New York City Ball Club in December 1911. (For more details on Pennock and the no home run, check out my post on \"The Legend of the No Home Run\" which covers this period of time.)\nWith the New York City ball club, Pennock pitched in 18 games, won 6 and lost 5. In his second year in the bigs, and the first season he faced lefties, Pennock pitched a no-hitter against Detroit on April 14, 1912. He won his next seven starts. He was named a National League All Star on July 9 for his outstanding performance. Pennock pitched one more season, in 1914, when he was traded to Pittsburgh. On August 8, 1914, he became the Pittsburgh Pirate's first baseman (and right fielder) when former Pirates manager Fergie Jenkins put him at DH. On December 3, 1914, he played his last game as the Pirate's first baseman in a 1-0 shutout as they defeated the New York Giants. He was the starting righthander at least again until 1925, when the Pittsburgh Pirates traded him to the Kansas City Monarchs.\nAfter five seasons on the Pirates, Pennock moved back home with Connie at the age of 36. He pitched very well for Connie in 1911, and pitched even better the next two seasons. He won his first two consecutive National League Cy Young awards in 1912 and 1913, winning the award each time. His home run total was never exceeded in Pittsburgh, and he won more than 20 games 11 times over the course of his career, including 11 straight until his retirement in 1940. He took some criticism for not being the same great pitcher with Connie. The team won the championship in 1916 with the same staff, but it took a major injury to one of the Pirates' stars for Pennock to be able to make the trip to the World Series. They ended up losing to the Cubs in five games. As a result of Connie's retirement in 1927, Connie would become a high level pitching coach to Connie's oldest son, Chuck.\nPennock's record on the mound with Pittsburgh was 2,118-2,167, with a career ERA of two and a half. He set a National League record by losing nine consecutive games to start the 1912 season. For most of his career, he used a four seam-seam fastball with the fastball, curveball, and forkball. Over a nine year period, he tossed the following pitches:\nPennock pitched more than 200 professional games for seven different organizations. He was a seven time Allstar, won 12 straight games as starting pitcher, two year's most of any pitcher in the NL, was in the Hall of Fame twice, was inducted into the Kansas City Monarchs Hall of Fame in 1962, and had a famous game played in Cooperstown in 1993. The following years, I am putting him in the Hall on behalf of all Pirates

{"id":4489,"ended":true,"length":663,"gen_text":"Ste Pickford developed the gameplay map for Ironsword. According to him, he basically copied the map that was used in a conversion port of Ghosts'n Goblins that he developed a couple of years ago for that publisher (no longer in development, sorry!). Ironsword had a single player campaign, and it did have an interesting battle system.\nThe map in question is called Ironsword, but there is nothing that tells us anything about it right now.\nBut now we have the answer.\nThe latest information on the Black Isle Games forums, courtesy of J.E. Sawyer (aka the author of Wasteland 1 & 2 ), gives some info on the map of Ironsword, and I think it is a good indication as to what the game would be like. The map:\nThe map is a rectangular area with squares placed in it.\nThe four corners are in the North, South, East, and West, and the four wings together form a square.\nThe bottom-right corner, where there is a diagonal cut, has five squares in it, so some of the pieces fit into those five squares. Also, there is a square in the middle, so that gives us some information.\nThe main point of the map is that there are three wings (West, South, East), and one central square in the centre, which will be used as the fight area.\nThe squares are divided into sectors, so there are four sides, and each side is 4x4 squares.\nWe have a bit of detail here, though that isn't clear. For starters, Ironsword, the main island\/province, is in the south, the south-east quadrant, which is a bit awkward. The map is also a bit cramped - in this case, because of the spaces between the wings. But in general we can infer that Irsionstone will be much larger in size than its predecessor. At this point, though, there is not much I can say about the battle system, as it is entirely possible that Ironsword was going to be just an island that we could fight over, and that's what Ironsword was until the publisher asked for a bigger land mass.\nAlso of note is the fact that Irsionstone is on a square, not a rectangle. The map we were shown does resemble some sort of rectangle. If that's how Ironsword has a battle system mapped to it, then I think I really want to see more about it.\nBut there are two things I don't know. Firstly, who is writing Ironsword? Sawyer said that the game was almost entirely co-written by Black Isle Studios writers - so it could be Black Isle again, or Ironsword could be a completely different game all together.\nSecondly, why is there a compass? Why not something less cumbersome? For those of us not into roleplaying, this would have been a good thing for a compass - but no compass - and Sawyer also said that there is no time in the campaign mode, since no cutscenes are required. (This is of course true - no cutscenes!)\nI am still a bit unsure about whether Ironsword is going to be a big-box retail release, or something independent from the main publisher.\nWe have no idea about a release date (or date at all), as Black Isle has said a good bit in the forums regarding the game's release timing, and as always it can change at any time.\nAnyway, stay tuned...","token_len":723,"entropy":[12.2781,3.248,10.467,1.7758,9.673,8.5936,1.8462,9.3214,0.9564,3.3592,2.0545,6.8993,0.0045,2.0208,0.1588,2.4745,6.9288,5.4983,0.8628,2.1727,3.9615,1.314,1.5065,0.9414,3.955,8.9405,9.9237,0.4486,9.8762,4.6296,9.9287,0.034,0.0054,3.6496,1.6569,4.3118,4.4136,2.2961,0.2626,0.0317,0.4875,2.9386,5.5171,5.779,3.4041,5.3825,2.812,0.6596,2.3209,2.4225,4.2785,1.7129,2.5978,0.0002,0.0144,4.4811,1.2529,5.2819,1.6592,0.6267,0.9855,2.0335,2.5671,4.8179,2.6467,2.86,3.2536,4.8201,0.4749,1.2778,2.1084,5.5764,2.4928,3.2383,1.1589,1.3979,2.1004,3.7717,0.0039,0.1392,1.7702,3.0457,3.4848,1.4631,3.321,2.8747,4.0764,1.6597,2.9289,0.1986,1.9432,6.9945,0.0895,0.3208,2.6174,4.5827,4.3042,1.4908,1.1789,2.1335,4.7238,1.5487,1.8676,2.0971,5.4479,3.185,2.4915,1.4632,6.1167,1.5576,4.8741,2.6086,3.2105,2.1601,0.0452,6.0426,1.8262,2.0073,0.0448,0.3809,2.7168,3.4307,4.2058,3.7813,0.0343,5.9718,4.2235,3.0105,0.0573,1.9978,3.2557,3.658,4.2888,0.6269,0.9344,2.4995,3.8633,0.3208,0.0,0.012,2.0672,1.4697,3.7932,2.4792,0.5728,2.1153,2.2277,2.5826,3.3546,2.7776,0.0223,0.3779,1.4723,1.24,4.197,1.4714,0.1992,0.4313,2.8852,1.4547,6.4025,0.1734,1.905,1.0956,1.2349,2.5363,4.8532,2.1247,2.0811,6.3603,3.8328,1.8471,1.3963,0.7333,3.1305,1.3503,5.7807,1.2687,1.2706,4.8027,0.615,4.0782,0.3501,0.9283,0.0473,0.2192,1.4197,0.1387,0.0043,1.8972,0.9516,0.5676,1.0164,5.0976,6.3221,1.0469,0.6518,2.5666,0.7366,0.5801,0.9899,5.6205,2.9472,0.8374,0.3004,3.7928,3.1051,3.6326,0.7617,0.5188,5.7295,4.9017,0.9124,3.0214,5.4013,0.7645,2.1448,0.1519,1.6176,4.2015,6.6192,2.4765,0.7358,5.7297,4.7116,2.2213,2.9864,1.972,0.2674,0.3513,5.611,0.3027,1.4746,0.8571,0.3034,1.9278,1.4812,0.1432,1.474,2.219,2.8029,2.483,3.7747,1.0415,3.4109,3.7644,1.9968,0.5536,1.1634,5.4355,4.0756,0.8001,1.3842,0.4898,0.1916,1.141,1.104,0.4018,2.8385,4.1973,3.109,4.4972,0.1527,2.0737,0.0703,1.084,1.0934,0.727,3.1793,2.4482,0.6002,4.0742,0.2562,3.328,2.1404,1.6869,3.9767,0.8947,2.1601,1.505,0.6117,5.8053,0.5303,0.3561,0.6123,1.3408,3.7819,1.3087,3.5333,0.4641,4.6964,0.7598,3.0408,2.1346,0.611,1.886,4.4891,2.1791,1.0731,1.3941,0.4913,1.7886,4.1953,1.1744,0.2181,1.491,0.4506,0.6091,4.3071,2.0592,1.9198,4.9376,0.3012,5.2728,2.0086,0.9544,4.418,5.4183,3.892,0.0007,5.6405,1.2042,3.1609,4.3076,0.0539,4.9591,0.0001,0.0102,4.5674,3.0796,3.6086,5.4193,6.276,4.6615,0.0042,1.0205,0.7852,2.5097,0.1303,3.8134,1.6082,3.5871,3.9102,0.622,0.596,2.4845,0.0064,1.8531,2.1648,1.0393,2.8049,1.4546,5.7765,1.0438,2.453,2.981,1.6245,1.9597,2.4002,0.5749,4.4054,3.8845,4.2783,3.2722,1.5241,0.405,2.7131,1.7679,0.2645,5.8613,0.9945,0.3819,2.4025,0.7808,3.3249,4.2246,0.8175,4.1217,0.6381,3.6136,0.3208,6.6923,2.5457,3.4197,3.269,1.9671,0.5001,3.1035,1.0072,3.2596,1.6615,0.6501,4.0593,0.6896,1.0219,6.2552,2.9287,0.1683,0.694,4.1345,0.0479,2.6161,0.618,2.9665,0.6936,4.6462,0.0808,1.0239,0.9725,0.8163,2.6363,0.1339,1.2505,2.3618,1.7428,0.7721,5.1417,4.0172,0.1238,1.7658,0.0003,0.0069,4.0599,3.1259,0.0902,0.5715,4.7919,2.9974,3.5677,3.8331,4.4117,1.8801,2.4948,2.8326,1.2645,1.3052,1.2977,2.965,2.1744,2.8667,0.0016,0.0093,1.8328,5.6112,1.6497,2.0531,3.7523,1.0445,1.0352,2.1878,6.1796,2.6276,0.4042,0.8903,4.9128,3.4347,0.5943,0.6009,1.2143,1.1451,0.0083,3.512,0.0334,0.0067,0.0166,0.7848,3.6643,1.3259,4.3103,1.1478,2.9011,0.2559,1.7215,0.6943,2.7228,2.4345,5.0943,4.3513,0.485,4.3015,6.486,4.4526,3.3005,0.0034,2.6377,2.912,4.3368,2.2877,1.3461,3.8747,1.2838,0.0003,0.0039,5.5635,4.2621,1.5324,0.794,6.5714,2.035,0.3168,0.0817,0.8363,1.8592,1.5006,3.1859,6.2175,2.0671,0.3417,1.2983,3.668,2.4407,0.7806,0.436,0.7738,4.0926,3.2244,1.806,3.0632,1.8228,1.9077,3.2584,0.0006,1.1358,1.4293,2.8973,0.0385,3.9579,1.2164,3.8917,1.0081,0.0004,0.0031,0.4454,3.8084,3.2878,0.5134,1.6978,2.361,1.4005,6.2069,3.4184,6.9293,0.0059,0.7183,0.2192,2.4373,0.0037,3.7406,5.3527,3.2127,3.4553,1.7396,2.5671,0.3907,3.4765,0.0045,4.4563,0.8142,0.5892,3.5065,0.0004,0.0087,1.9548,0.2183,1.7575,2.4007,1.383,0.6368,5.8368,0.0386,0.1698,1.455,0.7214,0.0526,3.0069,1.1138,2.1928,0.4813,5.1516,2.1044,3.3165,1.6293,4.1007,5.5975,3.8438,0.8438,4.7496,3.4557,1.0672,1.3285,4.8824,3.5746,4.6569,1.16,1.6171,2.5177,2.6792,3.1722,0.5794,0.811,2.9877,1.5473,2.7315,2.3379,1.5097,2.0169,2.1452,5.7297,2.3544,5.1667,2.6119,3.3312,2.9912,0.8627,0.1745,2.2199,1.9418,1.0902,4.8873,5.0846,0.5724,4.3024,5.1033,1.1847,5.754,5.582,6.1352,0.236,0.928,2.8879,0.4483,5.3275,3.1138,1.0922,4.7876,0.1176,3.2608,2.4721,3.7992,0.4132,0.0312,3.9691,0.8418,2.0261,3.3649,2.7943,2.7612,0.496,2.928,0.7292,3.9749,1.1043,0.0001,0.0024,0.8421,0.814,0.0032,0.1416,0.7691,4.0826,4.1095,2.7609,2.8073,1.1574,0.7546,0.5522,3.0073,6.5512,3.6977,1.0867,3.4721,2.8012,0.4266,3.5186,3.5453,2.2035,3.0567,0.6895,2.1286,3.1915,0.2147,0.0783,4.482,2.403,4.5102,1.037,0.016,1.4026,3.352,1.6459,0.0027,1.4604,2.7411,5.8609,6.2515,1.9509,3.1224,0.5483,3.094,5.0842,1.2623,1.2418,1.3714,1.5546,5.6321,1.3424,1.164,3.7701,4.2752,2.8331,4.3871,1.5446,1.6218,0.1194,0.4483,0.1681,0.963,4.402,0.0909,4.6549,0

{"id":517,"ended":true,"length":642,"gen_text":"A westward moving tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea just west of Bluefields, Nicaragua at 1200 UTC on September 18. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and sustained winds that measured 150 km\/h (90 mph) at 10,500 m altitude. The storm then began a period of intense convection in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm then moved towards the coast of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 55 kt [45.4 mph] on September 21 before weakening and breaking up on the night of September 30.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has classified the cyclone as a hurricane, noting it will track from northeast of Catamarca to near the southwestern tip of Cuba on Saturday afternoon\/early evening. If a tropical storm watch is issued for parts of Puerto Rico, the center of the storm could move near Puerto Rico's northwest coast with hurricane-force winds until the end of September, when it would make landfall near the central and southern coast of the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible across some of the areas of the Bahamas and southern Florida, the Gulf Coast of the United States and the Caribbean Sea from Hurricane Rosa's outer eyewall to the southwestern coast of Cuba on Sunday morning. Tropical storm conditions could extend away from Rosa through the remainder of the weekend, which will see Maria move near the Dominican Republic on Monday before tracking further to the southwest, across the Bahamas, southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States.\n\nPlease see this link for a technical description of how hurricanes work.\n\nThe latest NHC advisory on Hurricane Rosa will be updated as additional information becomes available. NHC urges everyone to monitor the progress and track of Maria using the NHC forecast model, as well as the advisory products of other U.S. government agencies.\n\nHurricane Rosa is located near latitude 30.1817 N and longitude 97.0075 W. On the forecast track, the center of the hurricane is expected to pass near or just north-northwest of Catamarca, Dominican Republic during the early next day or two. If a landfall is possible, Maria will move to the north-northeast of the island of Dominica. This is an area with potential for life-threatening storm surge and inland flooding. There is a chance for inland flooding from Maria's forward speed and gusts and the highest coastal flooding likely will occur where heavy rainfall over a wide area is accompanied by large wave action.\n\nIf a tropical storm watch is issued for parts of Puerto Rico, the center of this system will move near Puerto Rico's northwest coast on Saturday and then move towards the middle of the country and southwestern United States on Sunday. If the watch is issued for Puerto Rico, Maria could track just to the northwest of the island before returning south of the islands on Tuesday.

{"id":3292,"ended":false,"length":643,"gen_text":"Maia Ahmad, at the time wife of the musician Ahmad Dhani, had been a background singer for her husband's band Dewa 19 since 1993. She had been musically inclined since childhood and played keyboards in Khushnak's band in Pakistan. During the 1990s she toured in India with musicians such as Nasir Rizvi and Tufail Ahmad Rizvi.\n\nShe also acted in films such as Amna and Kishk ka Ghar (1995) and Kamal.\n\nIt is reported that Ahmad, who had gone to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, has taken the law into his own hand. His neighbours said she was upset about her husband's absence. \"He went home because he had a promise with a girl but he would be back the next morning. She had to meet her family at 6am to catch him. Her cousin who has stayed with her in Pakistan since 1991 was also informed that her husband died but had no idea what it meant,\" said local cleric Abid Khan, who is in touch with the local religious elders who have called for some form of closure so that a proper burial can be arranged for her.\n\nSources on the ground say Ahmad spent some time in a hospital last week after complaining of pain in his leg. According to his father, Ahmad asked him to give her some money, which he did. The rest is still being sorted out.\n\nAhmad had been married twice before marrying the Rachna family's daughter Tahira Rachna in 2004. She got two daughters with him. Ahmad then married Mohsin Ali Rachna in Pakistan, but this relationship too has ended due to problems.\n\nHe also married Hilda Kamble, then a teenager in Pakistan, in 1992 but later divorced her. In 2001, he married Rani Jhalani, a singer in Pakistan, which was supposed to last for three years. But Jhalani gave birth to a daughter whom he later divorced.\n\nAhmad was a singer with the local band Pathan (Pathan-Ki Saab), which he joined in 1990. The group won several awards and was shortlisted for various awards. In 2001, he won Best Musical Act at the Music Expo of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nHis cousin, Sulekha, said he had a girlfriend and had returned home in the evening from the festival and she was still waiting for him. She said that the woman had returned to her relatives farmhouse in Pakistan to look after her daughter and had missed her husband as he had also returned to work for a neighbour to earn funds. She said the women in her family were very attached to him and had never missed him while he was with his family.\n\nPathan-Ki Saab guitarist and vocalist Amir Ahmed said he tried contacting Ahmad's neighbours in Islamabad and elsewhere in the city to look for her, but was told that he had died. Ahmed said his colleagues in the local band and friends of Ahmad had no idea why he did not return by morning.\n\n\"There has been an increasing demand of Ahmad's burial in Pakistan for years and no action had been taken.

{"id":3032,"ended":false,"length":663,"gen_text":"Alien Spidy has a minimal plot. The story follows the Spidy, a spider from the planet < unk >, who has crash @ - @ landed on Earth during an attempt to find food. The Spidy is unable to walk or move because the planet has been reduced to a desert planet. Eventually, < unk > gets tired of looking for food in the desert, < unk > builds a life support system on the planet and begins to build a colony. As the Spidy lives off of the food, it begins to look less and less like a spider and more like a humanoid. But when the colony comes into contact with an alien from the Star Trek universe, < unk > realises that it's actually looking for a home.\n\nThe Spidy :\n\nThe Spidy is a male spider. As a spider, spider can change into the smallest animal, into the smallest tree, into an insect, into any plant, into any animal and into anything else.\n\nThe Spidy can change size using a pneumatic pump, making it so it can stay at any size.\n\nThe Spider can breathe in any atmosphere.\n\nThe Spider can shoot webs in any direction, making it so the Spidy can move around.\n\nThe Spider can use its venom glands to give the Spidy venom like substance which will stun prey.\n\nThe spider can use its claws to pierce enemies with its fangs.\n\nThe Spider is resistant to the bends.\n\nThe Spider can use its legs, even at the smallest size, to move around easier.\n\nThe Spider can shoot out silk to create ropes and ropes of the very highest quality.\n\nThe Spider has claws the length of its body.\n\nThe spider eats insects and plants.\n\nThe spider is able to climb in very any direction.\n\nThe spider has extremely strong muscles,\n\nThe Spider's eyes can move to see in any direction.\n\nSo why did the Spidy want to live on this desolate planet?\n\nA good question, and it's good that we could bring an answer to that question here, because not only does the comic give us a great little story about the Spidy's life on Earth, but it gives us a great small part of the universe. We're given a glimpse of the Star Trek universe, and we get to see how some of that universe's alien species might have evolved to fit their environment better. The spider is adapted to survive in this harsh environment, and with enough genes from its home planet it can make it to this Earth to begin its colonization.\n\nThe Star Trek universe is huge. When you really look at it, the Star Trek universe is so huge that even the story of this comic only tells a tiny part of what the entire universe is like. There are so many species of living beings in the Star Trek universe, and most of them are a mystery to the humans, with many of them still being found in a way no human beings know in the 23rd century.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this little piece of the Star Trek universe, and I look forward to reading more Star Trek in the future.\n\nIf you have some time, I would love to hear from you in the comments section below.

{"id":3755,"ended":false,"length":669,"gen_text":"Sent back on mission to the army in Belgium, Saint @ - @ Just again took supreme oversight of the Army of the North and contributed to the victory at Fleurus. This hotly contested battle was one that ended the Prussian armies' march into the Rhineland and paved the way for the liberation of Paris. On Christmas Eve, the great king of France was re-loved by the French people on the occasion of the first anniversary of the French invasion of Belgium and its subsequent victory during the Siege of Paris, on the 20th November, 1871. This day was named for the Emperor who was now King Saint Louis. The first King of France, Louis XIV, had first been crowned Emperor on Christmas Day 9th January 1713 at the court of Flanders. Saint Louis XV, who succeeded the now deceased Louis XIV, was the first French Emperor to be crowned on Christmas Day in France, thus becoming the first Emperor to celebrate Christmas Day during the reigns of two different kings. On the 25th December 1872, a new date was agreed upon for celebrating Christmas ; this was the second inauguration of a new Pope in 2,000 years. His name was Leo XII, and from the moment he set foot on Vatican City, the future Pope had been chosen to serve as the successor of the old Pope, Saint Pius X. It was also the last time the Catholic Church recognized the birth dates of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. On the 6th January 1933, the French were defeated by the Axis Powers at El Alamein. They could never live as equal to the British and Germans. They now had to work for a better life and for that, they sought out a means of obtaining political, cultural and material enrichment. In 1935, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Franco-Prussian War, the French people in Paris voted for the establishment of a National Bank. It is important to note that the National Bank of France was not under the control of the government but rather was independent. The French National Bank served as the major economic institution of France, and the people still held full control over its management. The financial institution's initial capital was not large until the time of the World War II. By the end of the war, the National Bank was funded by the profits accrued from the commercial and banking industry in France, with a capitalization of 4,976,000 francs and assets of 5,264,000 francs. This was to be replaced with 5,096,000 Francs on the 14th of December 1945 by the government of National Socialist France. As a result, the creation of the National Bank was a great step forward that was followed by a number of more liberal reforms. On 15th April 1943, the French government adopted the Constitution for a Free France. This would be the last law France ever adopted in its history of liberty, democracy and equality for all, and was signed on the same day that the Allies invaded the country, and became the last law in French history to be approved in the National Assembly by a simple majority. These liberal reforms helped in creating a better-educated society and more educated French people. There was plenty of good food and wine to be had in France, and French people would come here from all over the world for vacationing to see and enjoy the sights. The French were also more advanced in medicine when compared with other countries.\n\nFor more information regarding the origins of Christmas, check out Christmas Traditions in History!\n\nShare this:

{"id":85,"ended":true,"length":687,"gen_text":"Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five @ - @ year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, Strapping Young Lad's self-titled studio debut, as the highlight of his career.\nThe album was recorded in the course of three months.\n\"Strapping Young Lad's first proper studio album, but there are definitely those moments where I'm wondering, 'You know what? If this was my first album, wouldn't it be great if it were recorded at a smaller studio? Would it feel so much better? We have all these things that you love, but your band can't play in smaller spaces? Why are we talking about these things?'\" - Strapping Young Lad\nThe album was mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Alan Lomax, who has worked with everyone from Neil Young, David Bowie, Blur, U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana, The Police, David Gilmour and, most recently, Elbow. Other album mastering work completed at Abbey Road included that of the Queen albums Rock 'n' Roll Star and A Night at the Opera. A mix for the album was done by the band's guitarist, Matt Tong.\nBassist Matt Tong is a long-time member of one of Canada's most respected and revered bands (the legendary Stomping Ground ), but is best known as 'the bass player' in The Naked and Famous. He's played on several of the Naked and Famous' latest videos, including a new video as well as the recently released music video for their single 'One Night In Vegas.'\nTong explains that the band sought out Davey Havok and David Havok (both of N&F) to be in the video but both refused at the last minute, so the band opted to film the band in a different studio. Tong is excited to be a part of the movie and sees the time spent shooting the music video as a step towards the future of the band. He's also excited about the new music Strapping Young Lad will be releasing in 2017.\nOn the subject of playing their own songs live, Tong says that they have never done that before. \"The songs have been very stable for so long that it was important to us not to break the pattern\" he says. \"The fact is, the old record company had a whole bunch of old demos on the desk where Strapping Young Lad didn't really want to go over them. We just went with the flow with what it was.\"\nAfter some discussion with the people who worked on the album, the band decided that songs like 'One Night in Vegas' would be recorded live, while other tracks like 'Gemini' needed a different approach. Tong tells me that when he heard the band doing that song, he thought, \"Oh cool! Let's see how it sounds.\"\nTong believes that the idea to take a stab at writing new songs in a smaller space was brought about due to time in the studio \u2013 something he hasn't had in his life (the band is currently working on an album for their next album, but they are waiting to finalize the release date with their previous label). \"When we were making 'Strapping Young Lad,' we were working in a massive studio, it's just a different idea for how we work now\" he says.\nStrapping Young Lad's new record, Outta Your Mind, will be out via Big Dada Records on February 11, 2017.

{"id":2413,"ended":true,"length":692,"gen_text":"Perhaps the most famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18 @ -week course of antibiotics, ended with the removal of the lesions. During the 18-day course of treatments with antibiotics he also did the following:\n\n\"I sat to work at work, a hard, steady strain on my limbs that kept me out of bed for eleven hours. During these eleven hours of sitting I didn't lie down and rest; I sat at work, at the same time sitting up. This made me do some writing. The problem of sitting so intensely all day long was one that had to be met. I thought for some time that sitting too long would be dangerous. I did not want any one reading anything by me. As a solution, I sat while I ate, and while I was eating when the food was cold, but not when it was hot, otherwise the temperature would give me heatstroke, and there would be a problem.\"\n\nNow, at the age of 20 Huxley had a chronic sinusitis, and in this case he found that having a good night's sleep and avoiding caffeine gave him relief.\n\nAnd from that point on Huxley found himself back where he had started - writing in the dead of night for two hours a day. He had become obsessed with the idea that if he just tried hard enough he could avoid sleep for twenty hours every night. He could work at it for two days, and when that two days were done he thought he could do it for twenty. By the end of his book he had written five books using the approach, each containing, by his own admission, a hundred and fifty pages.\n\nNow this is certainly fascinating, but my question is, how does a person get to the point of becoming a chronic workaholic, where they find that they can work all day at one thing for two hours a day? I can almost hear the voices of the people who said 'You can't do that, you won't do that,' and others who said 'But you want to!'\n\nIt turns out that Huxley took some of the ideas of the Bates Method to extremes. He was also addicted to coffee, which he thought was the answer: he would just drink coffee regularly all day long. If you drink coffee every day all day long, you don't need to sleep. That is what many of the people who have used the book approach to work with have, and this is how some of them work for most of the day.\n\nIf you are interested in trying this approach that Huxley developed, I can recommend the book \" How to Stop Waking Up at Night\" which is all about just this kind of thing.\n\nThe big thing to remember is that it is never \"work\" that you dislike, rather \"work\" that you find does not produce the output you are looking for. Huxley himself never wrote a paragraph for a day, he wrote a paragraph once a day, because he didn't like the idea of being away from his keyboard for a day.\n\nThat was his attitude - \"Why shouldn't I do this? It's not as if I get to choose.\"\n\nAnd when your work gets stuck it is not because your brain is not working, but because there is no real \"product.\" That's the trick to work as fast as you can!

{"id":3941,"ended":true,"length":697,"gen_text":"On May 1, 2014, Michigan State University was named one of fifty @ - @ five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights \u201c for possible violations of federal law related to sexual violence in the classroom \u201c. The findings of the ongoing investigation were released in June, with OCR finding that Michigan State University has a 'hostile work environment' \u201c that negatively affects students using campus resources and encourages students to avoid due process of law \u201c and that the university may have violated Title IX, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Family Medical Leave Act, and may have engaged in gender discrimination \u201c. This new investigation has triggered multiple responses by university officials including campus speeches, changes \u201c in university policies and practices.\n\nThe investigation into Michigan State University's failure to meet Title IX policies has also found fault with the school's approach to investigating sexual violence in the classroom. The findings also describe a university environment that places 'the burden on the survivor to 'prove' his or her assault \u201c and discourages reporting \u201c. The school's procedures are characterized as 'deteriorated, confusing and in many cases, ineffective '. This failure not only impacts survivors of sexual violence who are harassed, assaulted or raped, but also creates an environment where harassment, assault, and even rape goes unpunished, which is a public health crisis.\n\nThe impact of the ongoing Michigan State University investigation has been the targeted release of research from universities across the country on sexual violence. These reports draw upon a wide range of data from universities across the country, including a comprehensive look at the experiences of sexual assault at three University systems in Ohio, the University of Michigan, and the University of Minnesota, the latter using nationally representative data, and looking at gender-specific data. This research has led to the sharing of their data with a newly formed website,'University Response to Sexual Violence ', which provides statistics for every University system in the United States\n\nThe latest national report, from the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics released its report on Sexual Assault in Higher Education during the 2012\u20132017 academic academic year. During this period, the Bureau of Justice Statistics analyzed data collected from the Department of Education and University systems and used that data to construct an overall picture of sexual violence on college campuses.. The report found that one in five women (18.8%) experienced completed or attempted rape in her college experience, with one in 10 male student victims and one in 38 female student victims of completed or attempted rape.\n\nThe report found that college students are more likely to experience completed or attempted sex crimes than the general population. Although 1 in 5 women on campus have been raped or sexually assaulted, the rate of sex crimes experienced by female students is two times higher than for male students, and one time higher than that of the overall population. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that women are also far more likely to report sexual assaults to administrators and to law enforcement than male victims - and more likely to suffer in silence. The report found that female rape victims often do not report their experiences, because their university does not offer specific support for survivors - and many women (including men) fear retaliation and retaliation from their universities if they report their rape. Furthermore, there are fewer women on campus if students don't report rape to local police because they perceive their schools as not being sensitive to reports of rape.\n\nFor more information on

{"id":750,"ended":false,"length":697,"gen_text":"Art director Randy < unk > led the set re @ - @ creation for the Enterprise and K7, describing the excitement over working on the episode as `` contagious ``. < unk > For me, that was the true payoff of the production. The actors and creatives got so excited with what we were creating that they knew we were in for something that would be amazing. < unk > As soon as the show was green lit, we knew we were on to something and we knew the team would go the extra mile to deliver this episode. < unk > If it had been up to me, this episode would have been produced in 4 days (for better or worse). < unk > We never knew how good it was going to be, with all the pressure on what we were doing, but we felt it was important to do things the right way to make it our best. < unk > I'm sure there are people that really wish some things had been different, but we felt it was important to go the extra mile and the script was perfect. < unk > The other thing I love about the episode is the production design. We went through a lot of options for the ship and I think we came up with the best one. < unk > That's a great compliment to the producers because the episode came together so well. < unk > The only way it could have been better is if we had just been able to go forward and do the episode without those challenges. < unk > It makes perfect sense because otherwise, that's what they had to deal with. < unk > Of course, it's not always easy because you're making art; it's hard to just sit back and say, ``That's good enough.'' < unk > I feel very lucky at my job; I feel blessed at the work we're doing. I'm never satisfied with the work we're doing, but I feel very fortunate at the fact that we're able to work on what we set out to do. < unk > It's been a very interesting year, but you know we could be sitting in a room right now, going through all the highs and lows. < unk > So many new things have come about that have been so great. < unk > I feel like we're in this happy zone right now and I'm looking forward to what's going to happen over the next couple of years. < unk > One thing I really want to say about this year is that I'm very grateful that I, my wife, my son, daughter, and family are here to be part of it. < unk > I mean that with all my heart. < unk > This company is so close to my heart that it's hard for all of us to look at the numbers and see the big picture. < unk > For myself, I look at it as a great year that I had, with the team, with our employees, with the fans of the show and our partners at the studios. < unk > I hope that I can continue to do my best work as an artist for the next five years, and I can tell you I'm not done with this story yet. < unk > Thank you guys so much for all you do to support us, and I hope to talk to you all soon! < unk > See you back here in 2023. < unk > Randy Out... or on\u00a0 Twitter @Randy_T_P... or on Facebook....

{"id":1843,"ended":true,"length":610,"gen_text":"Portree in the north at the base of Trotternish is the largest settlement ( estimated population 2 @, @ 264 in 2011 ) and is the main service centre on the island. Broadford has 2 service centres in Trotternish : Trotternish Service Centre ( TSC ) and Trotternish Service Centre ( TSC ).\n\n- the first major work station on the island, opened on 16th June 1972, has become the national service centre on the island and is the main service centre for the whole island.\n\nTrotternish is the gateway to Trotternish Harbour ( @ ). Trotternish has 4 hotels ( Trotternish Inn \/ Restaurant, Trotternish Lodge and Trotternish Hotel & Restaurant) 4 restaurants : Trotternish Inn, Trotternish Cafe & Restaurant, Trotternish Restaurant & Bar and Trotternish Lodge\n\nThis Island can be considered to be surrounded by the Cumbrian Highlands. In fact, the Highlands are so tightly squeezed and the Highlands are so geographically isolated that some of the other islands of Cumbria may be seen as a separate country! Trotternish Island is located on a secluded corner of the Cumbrian Highlands.\n\nThe most popular activities on Trotternish Island include the various tourist attractions: Trotternish's natural beauty and unique islands landscape, the fishing lakes, beaches, cliffs, deep canyons and mountains of the Glenalmond area. The island is also famous for its many fishing lakes that are stocked with many species of fish that can only be caught in our two fishing lakes, and our lakes are stocked with very high quality trout - the Trotternish River trout is known as one of the most challenging brook trout species in the world. One of the most unique beaches on Trotternish I visit each summer is the stunning Glenalmond Beach. The beautiful scenery and wildlife of the Cumbrian Highlands is captured over a short two-hour drive from Trotternish. It's one of the best places to start any Cumbrian Island walk.\n\nA variety of activities occur over the course of a given day, the most popular ones being walks, running, rock climbing, mountain biking, cliff jumping, snow shoeing, birdwatching, bird watching with a telescope and camping. There is a good selection of accommodation and camping facilities for a variety of budgets. On Trotternish there is a small village park with a caf\u00e9, visitor centres, camping sites and toilets.\n\nThe island is a popular destination for holiday makers and many of the major tour operators take their boats from Trotternish, and so there is a good range of restaurants near the island. Many of the hotels and accommodation are conveniently located within a short walk from the tourist attractions and beaches.\n\nYou don't have to be a sailor or a photographer to enjoy the island. Trotternish Island is an ideal place to get a glimpse of the many islands in the Cumbrian Highlands, to run, surf or ski, climb, fly or ride your bike, to have lunch, learn a new skill, admire the great landscape, or enjoy a night out.

The company said that the structure had become too dangerous to handle, with employees forced to use hand tools to dismantle it.\n\nIn February 2004, the company said it would lay off 60 employees, which was nearly 6 percent less than the company's March 2004 payroll.\n\n2005 and 2006\n\nIn late 2005, the company announced that it would reduce its workforce to about 800 from about 1,200 at its current address in Daly City, California.\n\n2006\n\nWhile the company's monthly sales in September 2006 were about $1.2 billion, they fell 4.1 percent from a year ago.\n\n2006 saw the company sell a 5 percent stake (approximately $ 50 million) in its Monster Energy brand, while continuing to market similar fuels under the \"Monster Brand\" name.\n\nAt the end of October 2006, two days after a massive gas leak caused thousands to be evacuated from a nearby reservoir, Monster Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\n2007\n\nIn October 2007, Monster Energy announced it had obtained a Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in the United States. This is the company's second such Chapter 11 filing in four years.\n\n2009\n\nIn September, Monster Energy announced that it would sell off its natural gas operations for $643 million over 35 years. The company said that it had purchased its assets with the intent of selling them to a bidder who has the necessary expertise to run the assets efficiently and profitably.\n\nBy December, the company said the buyer would be a third party and was looking for bids. The company has said it will make an announcement about the acquisition by the end of this year.\n\n2010\n\nWith oil at below $ 30 a barrel, the company's profits dropped over 12 percent in 2010.\n\n2011\n\nWith oil at less than $ 30 a barrel, Monster Energy announced it would sell off its Canadian operations to a consortium of the major Canadian banks, including one from India that offered $11 a share for Monster, to take total foreign investment to $23.5 billion.\n\n2012\n\nIn March, the company also announced it was selling a portion of its U.S. operations (equities including Monster Energy) to S.J.K. Energy, an Indian conglomerate, and acquiring a majority stake in S.J.K. by offering $15 a share for Monster Energy (the highest of any bidders).\n\n2013\n\nMonster Energy sold its U.S. subsidiary to Texas businessman and former Texas Rangers owner Bud Selig for $1 a share.\n\n2014\n\nMonster announced in December it planned to acquire two new units from Marathon Petroleum Corp. to supply its

{"id":3653,"ended":true,"length":622,"gen_text":"According to director Anubhav Sinha, the idea of Ra.One originated when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human. He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script 'which could be adapted for the new millennium' on the spot.\n\nThe film is inspired by the work of K. R. Narayanan, founder of R&D firm Infonet, and Anand Gopal, a computer scientist who was once called 'Father of Information and Communications Technology' before he passed away in 1986.\n\nA key scene shows a man remotely controlling Ra.One in the middle of a shopping mall. The person with the computer is identified as Dr Ravi. The main plot revolves around a woman looking for her missing son, with a twist. The villain in the film is a woman who wants to make a name for herself using the robot.\n\nDirector Anubhav Sinha (centre) and Ravan Das from Mumbai who are working on 'Ra.One' with Shri. Anuj Sinha Photo: PTI\n\n\"The whole idea is to address global issues. I want to spread awareness of the world. A robot for every situation. Robots are a great invention and can work in all kinds of weather. No one needs a car because the robot can serve the purpose perfectly,\" says Anubhav Sinha, the man behind Ra.One.\n\n\"We want to make the international audience feel at ease. Ra.One is a smart robot so it can talk to you and even act,\" says Anubhav who is co-founder of Jaipur-based robotics and automation technology firm Jaipur Robotics.\n\nRa.One is also the brain child of NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a former Minister of Electronics and Information Technology. \"Anubhav is the right person to make Ra.One a reality. He knows how to innovate and will work towards making the future brighter,\" says Rajiv.\n\nA key scene of the animation features a robotic hand that will be able to cook rice for a user, through a remote control. Photo: Priyanka Parashar\n\nThe Ra.One will have sensors so that it won't be affected by rain or snow. The entire movie will be shot in Hyderabad, and the team is working on a pilot project for a real commercial release in September.\n\nAnubhav Sinha plans to bring Ra.One to the Mumbai market. \"Mumbai is my heart but Hyderabad is where I want to be. I want Hyderabadans to see this film on big screens, and we plan to launch the full version for them after the film is a success. We intend for a digital launch in September,\" he says.\n\nNITI Aayog also has its eye on the commercial business. The organisation believes that a smart home and a smart device will change the way humans interact with each other and our surroundings.\n\n\"NITI Aayog's vision is that in a small house, smart devices will be used as an energy management system, to help people in terms of smart lighting, water temperature control, to monitor the food quality in a smart kitchen and to control the temperature in a house,\" says Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who is also NITI's chairman, in a statement. The idea of a robot controlled by a user on a smartphone is not an unknown one; the popular Disney film 'Cars' featured a very similar idea with its car system.","token_len":739,"entropy":[0.0086,9.024,6.7855,5.6287,0.0202,0.0433,1.4745,0.0056,0.1838,1.1084,4.5373,1.2869,9.2722,4.1768,1.7543,3.7121,2.4514,0.902,3.0313,2.6105,1.3997,1.6125,1.935,3.7826,2.183,5.323,10.5453,0.6971,1.038,7.1694,3.4286,2.0266,1.7082,5.8213,0.6868,0.2679,2.0643,0.9861,4.5804,1.4138,1.1929,7.7125,4.3482,3.2809,0.7531,4.0124,1.204,1.9077,5.0491,3.526,1.986,3.7345,1.1986,3.5637,0.1453,0.8793,0.0009,1.7763,1.4745,1.6102,4.2068,0.052,0.8029,3.4924,0.0396,5.4568,0.6853,4.5587,0.2502,0.3535,0.0517,1.9094,0.7746,5.0266,0.0697,5.539,2.0538,0.1625,3.1986,3.7229,5.2965,1.5875,2.0096,5.7561,1.6062,4.1741,0.1848,1.3364,1.7369,2.9667,0.4078,1.7536,2.5727,4.2715,4.9169,1.7482,4.596,0.0367,3.2678,4.2199,1.4273,0.092,0.8989,5.8793,1.0772,2.4705,0.0042,0.6809,6.1556,0.0853,0.4793,0.0002,4.0651,4.52,3.2689,3.7625,0.8279,2.9864,4.0631,0.2935,7.7979,0.2318,0.1428,3.2231,1.8399,3.1837,0.0083,0.5128,5.6902,0.2423,0.9171,1.5216,5.7497,5.2939,0.6346,3.2347,2.1603,3.8522,0.3173,3.6866,4.3833,1.6991,2.054,1.9217,4.6778,3.4455,1.4005,0.0057,2.2044,3.508,6.3573,0.3159,0.8715,0.92,1.0052,1.8126,5.1631,2.6599,2.3417,1.0966,2.2541,5.785,3.0616,0.1149,0.3189,0.2387,1.3898,3.6817,0.8369,2.1714,0.2627,3.5832,2.1824,2.0415,0.0327,0.0093,4.4658,1.493,5.0107,0.3563,0.2846,0.0002,4.1544,0.2484,0.0108,0.0026,0.0031,0.0439,0.0007,3.5311,2.2066,0.0002,0.1342,1.9636,3.6802,6.7317,5.5983,5.7518,4.5424,4.5471,2.2195,2.048,0.2809,3.1013,0.0722,0.0537,0.0376,0.5574,2.5941,5.7912,2.8428,1.2415,1.3033,2.213,0.2975,0.0019,7.0684,0.0762,4.0222,0.0002,0.1994,0.0002,1.5015,1.4453,4.4148,1.4981,1.4707,0.5915,6.1056,6.1355,0.4883,2.2287,2.7473,2.6682,0.273,5.1988,0.5862,2.0919,1.2961,3.0615,2.5277,4.4824,2.4701,4.6202,1.8492,6.0694,1.4312,3.4513,1.3748,2.8679,2.5449,3.841,1.6949,2.0802,4.0278,1.3596,3.1575,2.3067,0.0017,3.7293,1.3806,5.6579,1.4531,3.4631,2.2934,1.5382,4.0403,2.8435,1.3492,0.7316,6.4993,2.6724,1.4236,4.9202,0.9246,2.8648,1.0895,0.1892,0.002,0.0016,1.5605,0.0003,1.4933,2.5265,3.4185,0.1478,1.3971,0.0046,0.0373,0.1275,0.2784,0.0002,1.8031,2.0787,2.2728,0.2468,1.6533,1.8972,6.6997,1.4974,3.1577,3.2781,2.3866,1.4894,3.7445,0.016,0.0345,0.7901,1.3101,4.5037,0.9943,5.089,0.9277,0.894,3.2072,0.8378,1.0644,1.4693,3.4909,4.391,2.564,1.0649,1.0765,0.5383,0.0018,0.0016,3.3519,1.0414,5.5402,0.0107,1.2566,0.4757,5.494,0.2996,0.1191,0.2456,0.0108,4.3838,3.19,2.3647,3.1946,1.3615,3.7313,0.0565,0.0256,1.2419,0.616,0.228,0.0002,3.548,0.0089,0.02,1.0779,3.7291,2.5645,1.4763,2.3311,0.0033,5.6642,4.614,0.5725,0.0211,0.0002,0.0002,2.9898,0.941,0.3216,0.0563,3.1633,0.0188,0.2693,0.0021,0.0006,0.0004,1.0642,3.3741,1.0829,4.8764,0.2476,4.0473,0.1252,0.7346,0.0096,0.6794,2.4092,5.1636,0.5533,0.0029,0.0043,1.8261,2.2542,2.7564,0.3263,0.3515,1.8046,2.5165,0.0054,0.0379,1.4704,0.6617,0.3574,0.9334,3.7573,1.3638,0.0583,4.6594,0.6211,5.0159,2.5952,2.4365,1.1747,1.1134,3.6862,3.7605,0.7287,0.4587,1.8838,0.0042,0.6584,0.1361,0.0002,3.264,2.1996,0.1176,3.1533,0.9074,8.4234,4.1148,0.4705,6.8561,3.2139,2.4987,5.3654,1.7496,2.5986,0.0062,5.1399,3.4936,2.8879,1.4713,6.0351,2.7966,5.6538,1.3637,2.6317,0.1937,0.3075,1.9463,0.0186,6.44,0.0429,0.0283,0.013,0.0016,0.0001,1.4907,0.0002,1.6465,3.7451,0.0177,0.0229,2.8417,2.5959,4.6077,4.2518,0.5124,0.363,5.2011,0.0009,1.8646,2.7497,0.044,2.6949,1.015,1.4892,0.5489,1.5914,5.0728,3.9443,0.8935,0.1277,1.1095,0.5866,4.5893,0.0011,1.5663,2.6599,1.3576,3.0817,0.7756,1.899,0.7161,1.5464,4.3935,0.3122,1.3862,1.8579,4.3732,4.839,2.9037,1.8043,4.635,0.5898,0.4717,0.0002,2.3171,0.1029,0.002,0.0014,1.0115,0.0007,5.8125,0.0513,4.5545,1.4819,0.0037,0.0118,0.1946,1.5114,3.8146,0.925,2.0478,0.7295,3.8192,0.0634,0.5944,4.3823,3.7646,4.2146,4.3344,0.003,0.2856,2.2509,1.0901,0.8169,0.1157,1.8785,0.5193,1.0195,1.1012,6.1651,0.0132,6.0415,0.0446,1.9643,1.8291,1.2266,4.5287,4.9038,0.1953,3.3661,1.1733,3.383,4.0274,0.0693,2.6691,1.4986,5.2625,2.2208,4.6412,2.3449,4.1981,0.9855,2.6243,0.9015,4.5257,0.669,2.2159,1.3677,5.4958,4.6128,2.6965,5.1372,3.9672,2.1638,2.1455,0.8383,0.5087,0.2153,0.0262,0.2213,0.0002,4.7213,0.2759,0.004,0.0069,0.0003,0.0004,4.4528,2.1287,3.0882,1.7903,0.0619,1.0968,3.6873,4.2594,0.6367,2.3691,1.8662,5.505,0.4506,3.3137,2.2746,3.3247,2.916,2.1101,0.6404,5.4191,1.962,3.4042,0.3332,0.6851,4.9783,0.6721,0.1554,1.3432,0.0046,1.8154,5.4333,2.2267,0.1107,1.0238,0.0002,0.991,4.0741,0.051,0.0044,0.023,0.0002,0.0005,2.5688,1.2202,0.502,2.747,3.5813,2.0454,5.4191,3.9668,0.5355,4.279,1.0244,1.0805,1.6738,2.1199,3.0796,2.6447,5.58,2.4836,0.5514,1.4974,3.5496,3.036,1.8187,2.9599,4.6555,0.003,5.0673,2.3433,0.5475,3.5589,5.2995,0.6802,0.4773,4.4971,2.1723,1.3634,4.1192,2.3066,3.1137,1.5776,2.5182,1.4118,1.6115,1.5068,2.6047,0.7914,2.4925,1.2,0.9245,3.8223,1.1617,0.2258,2.2058,0.0441,0.0811,0.0008,0.0007,0.5492,0.1695,3.2932,0.5458,1.1617,2.8586,0.0088,0.0023,4.4137,3.6594,3.1245,2.7904,0.5789,0.4375,0.0663,4.4701,3.5158,2.1821,1.6483,3.6821,5.2469,0.6863,0.8797,2.1045,4.1964,0.763,2.421,0.8488,2.0399,4.7924,3.7908,0.4019,4.275

{"id":208,"ended":true,"length":673,"gen_text":"On May 17, 2016, Nathan signed with the Chicago Cubs. He was immediately placed on the 60 @ - @ day disabled list upon signing to continue recovery from his previous Tommy John surgery.\n\nIn the July 22 game vs. Chicago White Sox\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Nathan injured his right thumb and was removed from the game to be evaluated by the team's medical staff. He then took part in the first team infield drills of training camp after coming off the 60 - @ day DL on July 24.\n\nWhen he returned to the starting 5 spot for the start of the 2016 season, he struggled to adjust to the position, which was difficult to perform at. The club eventually moved him to the 8 @ - @ infield slot with Daniel Murphy batting leadoff.\n\nOn April 13, 2016, Nathan was scratched from the game while in the midst of a career day with 6 RBI's and 4 H. He would make the roster for the month of April, which ended with 8 starts and an overall record of 10-15.\n\nHowever things got worse for the 22 yr old in May. He hurt his right elbow in a home plate collision on May 18. Noting that the team knew about the injury, Murphy went on to say that they would not use the injury as an excuse for the team, however, he believes that Nathan will have the surgery and then will prove he can stay on the field.\n\nOn June 9, he was placed on the 60 @ - @ day disabled list in order to address his elbow injury as well as further recovery from a hand injury suffered while playing shortstop for Triple-A Iowa on May 30.\n\nOnce he returned from the disabled list and was available for the start of July, he was used in the starting 5 spot, at the expense of Daniel Murphy hitting in the leadoff spot.\n\nHe would eventually record his first career multi-hit game on June 14 vs. the White Sox, however, the first two runs he recorded were in a 9-5 loss.\n\nHe was given the start for the Nationals for the next 4 games, going 1-3, with a 3 run single at home vs. the Marlins on June 21 and at home vs. the Yankees on June 22.\n\nHis next start was on June 27 at Boston, however, he did not impress with an 3-5 record along with 6 runs and a solo homer off of David Price.\n\nAt the end of July, Nathan would again be placed on the 60 @ - @ day disabled list to correct a hamstring injury sustained during a rehab assignment with Single-A Potomac on July 11.\n\nAs he had done for more than a full season, Nathan returned to the Nats bullpen on August 5 for a 3-1 win over the Padres.\n\nHowever, in less than seven days, the injuries would once again return. On August 11 he would be placed on the 60 @ day DL and would not return to a major league game until August 15 at Washington \u2013 when he would pitch a scoreless sixth inning in a 1 @ 2 tie game against the Giants at Ebbets Field. He would pitch his next game two days later, however, in that one he also recorded a run and walked once in 4 1\/3 innings vs. Los Angeles.\n\nOn August 18, he was released along with a good portion

{"id":4932,"ended":true,"length":702,"gen_text":"Some table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nThe major concern about table salt is that it can form crystals when stored in the hot environment of an industrial facility.\n\nAn industrial facility is a building or part of a building that is used for the production of goods or services or both. Examples include businesses like chemical or metalworking factories, paper and printing companies, and metal finishing firms. Because of these purposes, such buildings or facilities are often constructed with high temperature and airtight (air-tight seals are the main reason for calling them airtight for temperature control purposes).\n\nCeramic tiles, glass, and concrete have long been known to react with a large number of chemicals and materials including natural and man-made chemicals. The chemicals and materials can react causing chemical damage to some, and a chemical release can be caused to others, and there are a number of chemicals used to control these chemical releases.\n\nAt higher temperatures, salt crystal growth is greatly accelerated in these buildings or facilities. A crystal can form as small as one millimeter in length. These crystals can form when water is introduced into a salt salt solution where the crystal is present. When the crystal forms it will then be dispersed with the solution and then will begin to grow. At such temperatures crystals are the fastest growing and most destructive type of salt crystal due to the high reaction rates of oxygen and water, and that the salts are highly corrosive. The chemical damage done to the crystals and environment can be extensive and include damage to the buildings themselves, contamination of drinking water and\/or the surrounding ecosystem, and also lead to respiratory problems and skin contact burns. This is the reason that the amount of chemicals being produced or consumed in an industrial facility are extremely high and many may be extremely hazardous.\n\nThe World Health Organization has classified salt as a likely carcinogen. Based on this same classification it is recommended that salt never be used in food preparation.\n\nThe European Commission is using an existing EU directive banning highly processed foods made with salt from being sold in food shops in some of the countries of the EU. This is based on the potential carcinogenic properties of common salt salts.\n\nIn addition to the health problems of salt, research has been done for decades that has proven that salt has an adverse effect on people with pre-existing cardiovascular or diabetogenic disease. This effect has been proven by research done, for example, in the studies conducted on people who are currently living with diabetes and who have either been diagnosed or who have been previously treated with drugs that lower blood sugar levels (insulin). One of the main questions to this research is whether salt can cause diabetes or whether it is the diabetes that causes a person to become exposed to salt. Research findings clearly show that these diseases are caused by a combination of factors. In other words, it seems salt does not cause one disease, but it can be one of several factors that cause diabetes.\n\nHowever, there is also research looking at the effects of table salt on blood pressure levels. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) data, people who consume large amounts of salt have higher blood pressure levels than those who consume very low amounts of salt (less than two grams of sodium per day). Studies performed in Finland in 1978 have shown that those who had higher average blood pressure levels had higher blood sodium levels also.\n\nThe reasons for such association are unclear. More research is needed to try to explain the connection between salt and blood pressure levels.","token_len":740,"entropy":[11.2362,6.0224,6.7412,3.2171,5.9079,7.3445,4.0421,2.8538,9.8628,3.0762,1.4533,0.0022,2.2218,0.6686,1.1638,5.6989,2.7402,1.3856,5.1799,0.0694,0.6143,2.683,12.1705,2.6789,2.2163,0.1175,2.9768,2.5783,1.9424,1.801,1.2359,0.0065,0.0009,0.958,1.4116,0.0011,5.8437,2.5995,0.7735,1.1588,0.1864,0.0001,2.0371,5.7031,1.7808,1.4137,0.624,0.0082,0.28,0.95,0.3391,1.6089,5.5299,1.9685,3.3374,4.7518,1.2514,1.015,3.601,0.8369,0.7043,3.3923,3.42,3.1669,0.5511,2.3733,0.0002,5.7356,1.4936,0.9953,1.3761,1.2709,2.1732,1.4797,4.7304,0.0294,0.1618,0.0087,1.1545,0.9857,0.9975,0.8102,1.123,0.64,0.2915,1.8639,1.4568,0.292,4.3791,2.9096,0.3796,1.8459,0.6397,5.785,2.7681,3.0401,3.1182,2.9714,5.4613,1.4297,0.3797,3.628,2.314,2.1495,4.0403,0.1266,1.4733,4.2667,4.1633,4.3774,0.0794,5.7149,1.2182,3.0123,4.6247,0.0643,5.253,1.7869,4.0426,1.7561,0.7299,1.2834,4.4381,1.0751,2.362,2.7602,1.9108,5.0351,1.1629,5.9902,1.1001,0.7098,0.7651,4.1062,3.2352,3.2696,2.9323,2.7929,0.8979,5.2478,0.7486,1.8641,0.2428,6.4717,5.6975,3.0645,0.9945,1.0991,0.6328,0.0002,5.1612,0.7914,0.0598,3.7483,1.698,3.8839,0.8319,0.8166,3.3498,3.5218,5.8327,0.2679,2.6676,0.052,4.1948,0.2985,4.6796,3.8236,0.8732,0.0044,1.468,1.9024,4.3551,3.9796,5.0573,1.7191,0.69,0.1869,0.0009,2.1221,0.8527,2.576,3.5872,1.5303,0.2849,2.09,1.2049,5.7951,2.6479,6.3108,0.7851,5.4187,5.0357,1.7398,4.2166,1.9337,3.1398,4.9259,3.1521,3.0477,1.4408,0.8014,2.9492,3.1984,4.4634,1.4684,2.8735,1.3078,0.0058,2.8904,3.5331,2.4128,1.3045,1.4497,3.9279,0.5268,0.3473,0.6685,0.0002,5.6622,4.1921,0.0824,0.5456,2.8658,3.8738,1.4201,1.6553,5.3609,1.2974,3.8783,1.9664,1.8536,2.8342,0.0805,0.3764,4.214,3.7623,1.7186,1.0457,3.2964,2.8748,0.0984,2.1999,1.8291,0.2677,0.9012,3.0792,1.5116,3.0645,0.2299,0.7838,3.3216,4.1237,3.3115,1.7574,3.8177,0.6435,1.9066,0.8484,4.332,0.429,5.518,1.0304,2.8425,1.7116,5.0061,0.5505,2.81,1.2958,2.1944,1.6579,2.1439,2.7485,3.9485,2.5782,4.8717,4.9736,0.7152,2.1498,1.566,4.1608,3.1532,3.6457,0.1349,0.5701,1.4291,3.9744,4.8369,1.5431,2.6551,2.1168,5.3882,3.5307,0.1256,2.9753,0.7191,2.1052,1.7245,0.0165,1.6933,0.2821,6.2122,0.0087,1.1925,2.6896,6.1489,1.0469,2.5096,6.3383,0.8077,1.4727,3.2724,1.0477,5.4171,3.144,4.0603,1.2972,2.8239,3.1915,0.0005,0.5698,3.0331,4.7343,3.2081,3.2231,0.8585,0.7648,2.6506,3.1917,5.0508,1.7302,0.8978,3.1891,1.289,3.9828,3.7323,0.0441,1.0068,3.738,2.3093,0.5357,4.9194,0.1354,3.551,0.0429,2.2453,4.4911,0.0038,2.3117,2.5456,4.9806,0.2577,0.4886,4.2559,4.2282,0.0108,4.6918,0.7291,1.9527,1.872,5.3367,3.7445,0.3995,4.5333,1.3373,2.7327,1.0558,1.1611,2.2139,5.664,0.0692,3.3754,4.6334,4.1857,3.2871,3.6457,1.1013,1.7906,0.103,0.4054,2.8423,4.0479,0.5739,1.8486,4.9752,5.8327,1.2028,4.6328,2.0299,0.79,0.2323,0.0002,2.2298,4.8479,0.0104,0.0426,2.1284,2.4792,1.1659,0.715,0.2547,6.5599,0.4408,0.026,0.9987,5.8781,0.0457,1.6983,6.5118,0.9822,3.4035,0.9117,2.9073,0.1392,1.519,5.1923,0.0151,0.5976,0.5829,1.6259,1.7827,1.1949,0.9811,0.0002,2.5087,4.9577,1.6926,3.7791,5.8293,3.8178,4.8716,3.2402,1.9408,6.4588,6.622,1.3187,1.087,3.5248,0.531,0.9781,2.694,2.4272,0.8021,0.2655,4.7288,1.2817,1.1357,4.035,2.8208,0.3548,2.5506,1.8425,0.7924,1.4874,0.4898,1.7962,2.1255,3.4345,0.0773,0.8548,4.5488,2.1728,0.7617,2.0117,0.0824,6.3173,1.0551,2.2844,0.7867,1.0324,0.0002,2.8492,2.6679,0.727,0.9803,2.7221,4.2104,3.1513,1.1803,1.745,5.833,0.6269,3.1839,0.7541,5.709,2.2996,2.5017,1.6095,4.5473,0.5913,1.5625,2.3933,2.6721,2.4788,0.2714,0.0469,3.8697,1.7537,4.1651,0.0304,0.4534,3.035,2.6578,5.8084,0.5652,2.0591,2.0252,0.3094,2.4865,3.1747,2.5293,0.2217,3.121,2.6026,3.3155,1.813,6.5961,0.9808,0.1433,0.0713,0.837,1.3955,5.3761,2.9084,1.6956,2.5493,1.8074,2.2406,4.1704,3.4948,0.048,1.8353,2.1603,2.3566,0.8995,5.0393,2.3709,1.1997,1.5572,3.0356,1.0186,1.0801,5.0411,2.2243,1.3822,1.8541,1.5061,3.1508,0.1824,0.3407,1.0722,3.7714,2.2949,0.011,0.7716,4.9813,0.9281,0.2639,3.1771,5.4401,3.6316,4.4293,0.7379,0.8913,0.9492,2.2274,1.8032,1.5277,3.2254,1.9898,1.8391,0.9822,0.7303,1.9493,2.7939,0.8729,0.2491,3.7306,1.7682,0.1419,1.5003,5.5076,0.0106,1.1371,0.5115,4.4069,6.1336,5.9839,0.7777,0.0655,5.1439,3.9077,0.6638,2.4973,0.15,1.7967,0.6119,0.0125,1.3636,1.5359,3.3396,1.6862,0.0299,0.1474,1.9197,3.8832,5.8756,2.1284,0.4261,0.2514,3.0909,0.8462,1.048,0.3197,1.2494,1.5427,2.742,2.9819,0.3437,1.3535,0.8748,0.6347,2.0821,2.6959,0.5148,0.5527,0.0002,5.2109,0.0506,2.0657,0.7747,1.8387,1.3351,6.4384,0.3727,0.8475,1.6451,0.111,5.2208,0.0137,0.4365,3.4213,0.4548,2.8171,0.5583,4.7574,0.0032,1.6712,3.395,0.1181,0.0042,2.0496,0.064,0.0,1.2039,5.9046,0.7278,2.5296,0.6605,1.2956,2.5543,0.1112,0.0129,1.1655,1.4722,1.3823,0.1183,0.0245,0.4498,0.5969,0.7506,0.1336,0.6715,2.383,1.7549,0.1391,0.4187,0.0603,3.2986,1.5665,0.0053,4.2507,0.7714,1.8329,1.3295,0.369,0.0078,0.2889,4.2204,5.1108,1.1742,4.6804,3.1536,5.0187,4.2797,0.3302,0.1578,3.025,0.4494,3.7287,2.9545,4.9111,0.2799,0.0631,0.3217,1.3092,1.1485,2.0174,1.8591,0.1105,6.0654,0.31,1.5648,0.0002,2.1832,5.5009,0.3137,3.9435,6.1949,0.6541,

{"id":53,"ended":true,"length":503,"gen_text":"Many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups both on the anionic carbon center and on the sulfur. The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents (see 'Syngas' for further details).\n\nFig. 3\n\nThe following example of a novel alkyl group, namely S12\u2013, can be prepared with the help of a cyclopentenyl ether (CETA)-based cyclocatalyst. Firstly, the cyclopentenyl ether, a strong base, was reacted with bicarbonate-acetate (BC) (Fig. 4A) to form the pyridine compound, which was then reacted with the hydroxide (CH 2 OH) to produce the thiocyanate C5, followed by the reaction of cetyl ether, CETA, with a suitable functional group, notably catechol (Fig. 4B). The use of the cyclopentenyl ether facilitated the formation of the cyclization intermediate, a mixture containing the alkyl group, cyclopentenyl ester, and catechol, while in this case the formation of the thiocyanate C5, was facilitated by the addition of 2-Bromo-catechol (Fig. 4C), the corresponding reaction product. The thiocyanate derived from these reactions then can be further further cyclized with phenylacetic acid (Fig. 4D), and further processed using the same reaction mixture to form a thiocyanate as shown in Fig. 4E.\n\nFig. 4\n\nThe thiocyanates C6 and C7, which have been obtained as a byproduct of the thiocyanate C5, are obtained by further reaction with the aldicarb-containing alkanes H-3 (Fig. 4F), H-4 (aldehyde-2-carboxylic acid), and H-4a. The reaction time was 60 min at 50\u00b0 C.\n\nFig. 5\n\nThe following reaction is an example of the synthesis of mixtures of hydroxybutyric acid (HBA) with three functional groups, namely thiocyanate, thiocholanat, and aldehyde-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 6). The final product for each reaction can be prepared either on the direct reaction with water or by the use of a pyridine cyclocatalyst. Furthermore, these mixtures, which are prepared in the following steps, can be further cyclized using pyridine-bifluorobitrazole (Fig. 7) as a reagent. Note that the synthesis of the aldehydes, for example thiocyanate, thichol and triethanol, requires the combination of the hydroxybutyric acid (HBA) with methanesulfonic acid, but no other functional groups are required for the synthesis of hydroxy butyric acid (HBA).\n\nFig. 6\n\nFig. 7\n\nThe following examples of specific reagents (including two inorganic compounds), whose incorporation results

{"id":1079,"ended":true,"length":667,"gen_text":"With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but participates in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie's first lines were spoken in `` Good Night ``, but never in the game. \u00a0Griggs, who plays Maggie in the comic-book canon, is extremely protective of the character and keeps the comics, short stories, and artworks she made of Maggie's early life very tightly wrapped up within the confines of Maggie herself. \u00a0Despite this, the comic artist has no intention of canonizing Maggie's early life, at least not in any way.\nMaggie, the first female member of the Wollatonians who can fight the Red Men; one would think that Maggie's initial motivations are to protect her community, but, of course, she is more interested in getting rich and staying that way.\nA good representation of Maggie's character from the comic books, though, can be found in Issue One of the game. \u00a0Just as with all of the early characters in the game, the player's introduction to Maggie is via his very first cutscene. \u00a0After being called down in the cave by D.B. for not having some magical item, D.B. finds his way to your hideout. \u00a0Inside your hideout, he decides to play some \"fantasy football\" (the game with only two teams: your own Red Men and their enemies, who are the Wollatonians). \u00a0The problem is that the other team has a player named Maggie, a woman who is obviously meant to be an allegory for Hillary Clinton. \u00a0When D.B. scores, Maggie begins to dance, as if in anticipation of a happy outcome. \u00a0As you're playing, however, this becomes apparent that Maggie is actually dancing to the music of the music box which was supposed to distract D.B. from the magical items he's wearing. At this point, you can choose to kick D.B. out or ignore him. \u00a0I suggest that you ignore him. \u00a0Although he is an extremely irritating dude, he has been good for your game, because not only does he give you a way to get some of the useful items you need, he's also kind enough to do the small tasks you ask of him. He can be a little annoying and he only wants the things he wants for himself and you can just go on doing whatever you want to him. Anyway, if you choose to kick D.B. out, Maggie gets upset and, in a very strong gesture of maternal affection for this kid, begins dancing. \u00a0She dances her ass off. \u00a0Her dancing moves and her song, however, do not stop there. \u00a0I really want this character to be a great representation of what an actual baby would actually do. \u00a0I know it's impossible; after all, her song was inspired by the sound a baby might make. \u00a0\u00a0 But that's kind of what I want a baby to be. \u00a0For one, I want to have a baby. \u00a0But for another, I also want to see my favorite characters from a series I love in such great terms. \u00a0I imagine some time in the near future, there will be a sequel which features Maggie's daughter and, well, it might even be called Maggie: The Musical.

{"id":4339,"ended":true,"length":700,"gen_text":"As the rebel forces advanced towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios ( or, according to the English'William' ), in the thick of action, ordered his men to retreat to his own lines. In this he would continue the fight until he himself was captured.\n\nThis time Alexios could not escape the trap that he himself had set for his men. As his forces returned to their positions the Greek rebels attacked yet again, and this time he was driven out of the town and into the thick of the action himself. The Greek rebels were now forced to battle their way towards the walls of the town, but Alexios knew that for every town gate they breached, a Roman soldier was lost, which only confirmed his victory over his enemies. As a result more and more rebels broke through his lines, forcing him to deploy his force more and more carefully as his Roman allies were drawn away and the Greek rebels were gaining ground, and there was no longer room for the Greek rebels to exploit their numerical advantage during the second stage.\n\nFinally Alexios was able to make his stand and when the rebel forces came within sight of the walls of the town, the fight for the town broke into full swing. The Greeks charged the defenders, whilst the Romans took up defensive positions which they were unable to change. With each side's casualties mounting, the siege finally bore its fiercest test and both sides were forced to choose between surrender or risk heavy losses in the face of a Roman invasion. Despite having exhausted all of his troops Alexios decided to face certain defeat rather than leave his soldiers behind in their town without a chance of protection, therefore choosing a strategy of taking the town without a fight and letting his men return to their homes. After the Roman attack the rebels abandoned their siege weapons which had proved invaluable when besieged during the Persian wars, in favour of lighter military equipment such as knives and javelins, and fled the region towards Colchis.\n\nWhile this might seem an extraordinary strategy it was very common during Alexander's time, as he had been fighting for over twenty years in the region. To try and ensure that the rebel army would not be able to escape any town gates Alexios ordered his forces to enter the town with minimal resistance. He then sent his officers to the homes of several of the rebels to ask for bribes to be given, which the rebels had to return with.

{"id":1595,"ended":true,"length":709,"gen_text":"A weakly defined tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on September 20, and crossed the northern portion of the tropical Atlantic and northern South America without significant organization. The wave, characterized as a short-lived tropical cyclone or tropical depression, crossed the border between eastern and western Africa approximately 90 miles east of Senegal and approximately 70 miles south-southeast of Cape Verde Islands, and entered the West Indian Ocean.\nWith this brief history of events before us, and with the ocean currents not yet fully in a state of dynamic equilibrium, it is certainly not clear that any tropical cyclone or weather system will have any lasting impact. On the other hand, the weather system that developed near the western coastal Bahamas on September 19 has since weakened. If a tropical cyclone were to form in any one of those two waters soon, it would probably be fairly small in size, with average winds from the center around 40 miles (64 km) per hour (the National Hurricane Center is generally conservative) and with maximum winds of around 90 miles\/h (55 kilometers\/h, about 56 knots).\nHowever, a tropical storm or hurricane would not be any less important. According to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center (SPC), such a system would be the first of its type to develop during the calendar year 2014, and one of the first since the hurricane which formed over the central Atlantic in January 2014.\nSuch storms have had a substantial influence across the Atlantic basin this year: from Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana on August 29 to Superstorm Sandy in New York City on October 29 as well as the derecho that affected the Midwest United States and Canada. Additionally, such systems have caused considerable damage throughout the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The latest SPC NHC forecast lists the possibility of tropical pressure systems forming near the U.S. East Coast in the next few days, although that forecast could change if the hurricane-force storm system that developed near the Bahamas is allowed to strengthen further.\nSo why haven't we seen much in terms of hurricane activity this year? The reason is that the hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin is still relatively weak relative to the overall Atlantic hurricane season. A record low number of Atlantic hurricanes took place in 2011, despite the generally cooler winter and spring. The overall Pacific area of influence, which includes both the Gulf of Mexico and western Pacific Ocean, only had three hurricanes so far in 2013, with all of them being the remnants of Hurricane Rosa over Mexico on August 26.\nRegardless, we can clearly say that there are several factors working against us this year in the eastern Atlantic, not the least of which is that the major hurricane seasons in the region typically see a large number of tropical storms and cyclones. The total number of major hurricanes this year has not been particularly high for a given length of time (except for the western Pacific where a large number of storm systems has created a significant number of hurricanes). Instead, we are seeing relatively weak activity compared to the average, and no major tropical storm formation. Thus, there are many reasons why we won't see very many major hurricanes in the Atlantic for the coming year.\nThe question of whether this year's Atlantic hurricane season will be the wettest or driest ever is likely to remain the same. The tropical Atlantic is located near the midpoint of the tropical season, and even the most active parts of this storm season will not create a significant change in overall rainfall in the Atlantic basin. In fact, as mentioned earlier, there is a chance that the most recent tropical depression in the Atlantic could have brought even more rainfall than what we currently have on the table for the entire season.","token_len":741,"entropy":[9.4005,4.4823,4.4547,10.9988,5.7047,7.7117,4.113,0.3852,4.0097,0.1671,0.0811,1.8921,2.0471,3.8855,3.4768,0.6418,3.4772,5.6998,0.4428,3.8899,5.0357,0.0019,0.1233,6.6302,0.2167,4.3243,4.2351,3.9067,2.1671,7.229,3.4737,9.2633,0.6649,1.5314,1.5618,3.0943,4.9883,2.3376,0.4086,4.2938,0.213,0.7792,1.944,1.6694,0.0056,3.6796,1.5854,0.4055,0.2925,5.2404,0.7042,5.3923,1.0115,4.8884,0.7968,0.1655,0.3473,3.8255,4.3979,0.9342,2.1764,0.2114,5.6461,1.8834,2.2419,3.4448,0.0093,2.0773,2.8562,0.4876,0.0023,0.0068,2.7545,0.3118,0.0013,3.3524,1.8748,2.0306,4.4087,0.1429,6.0491,1.2421,0.0652,1.3151,2.368,13.0279,3.0878,5.3768,4.2785,0.9419,4.0431,5.147,1.1217,0.1005,4.4648,1.4249,0.9375,5.7654,2.4756,5.2312,1.5787,1.6669,1.8858,4.1137,1.0654,0.2729,4.404,0.3152,0.1616,1.8771,0.4254,5.6027,2.495,4.0738,1.5567,2.5515,2.417,0.5238,0.0437,2.4493,5.4565,1.1473,1.009,3.8129,1.9617,3.4165,1.0261,2.3144,4.9493,0.287,0.2393,0.0103,0.0102,1.7795,5.0309,2.6419,1.6702,2.3125,3.5913,0.7381,3.3475,6.4296,5.0956,1.4633,0.3358,1.9537,3.0333,4.592,3.163,3.4593,3.8902,3.1195,1.6828,0.709,0.0008,2.5506,0.0569,1.1409,1.2141,4.7066,3.6285,0.0774,2.5826,3.5819,4.8651,6.2322,0.1892,0.6408,0.7398,2.2908,1.1763,5.3349,3.2198,2.9539,0.4885,1.05,2.2973,6.559,2.2427,3.901,1.2891,2.4669,4.3741,2.3699,1.5161,3.3814,1.3864,0.9349,0.1091,0.1458,0.0005,2.5054,4.4187,3.7483,0.0388,0.0034,4.2523,5.7425,1.3057,5.3107,0.2094,2.7454,1.7086,2.1333,1.4322,1.1689,3.1295,0.0578,4.8693,1.0438,0.0502,1.03,3.7811,0.0425,0.0234,4.6912,3.2783,2.0272,0.6292,0.3842,1.7699,3.4828,0.0173,3.1168,1.1326,2.2174,0.9337,0.6428,2.0917,2.7254,1.0898,5.2746,1.5403,4.6448,2.0651,5.3121,0.0051,2.6432,1.2746,3.5906,0.0202,0.0021,2.2238,0.1932,0.0014,0.2694,4.068,0.2563,0.4691,0.8215,2.2248,2.2691,1.1952,2.216,0.9068,2.3818,0.6653,2.2671,5.1116,0.4527,4.3718,0.0164,3.768,1.0366,0.5673,4.8378,0.4375,0.4232,0.91,3.3672,1.9646,3.8476,6.3184,2.0834,2.4419,0.3904,2.7625,1.7359,1.2113,3.1881,4.5593,0.263,1.8045,4.2592,3.8044,2.7869,4.1397,0.9142,4.0634,2.523,5.8611,0.3274,0.8598,2.4312,3.2414,0.3315,4.5382,4.2569,3.4145,4.7397,0.7729,1.6893,3.4771,0.1773,0.0755,0.6736,3.5237,0.6965,0.0021,0.307,1.2433,0.1886,1.5079,0.279,0.056,0.1181,7.3744,0.5221,0.0083,1.3951,5.2519,0.1043,1.6266,3.2938,1.0028,2.9167,4.1507,0.0005,1.9504,1.999,2.5204,5.3607,0.0132,2.8677,2.1368,0.7677,3.0552,2.7005,0.4283,3.7506,0.1465,2.0414,2.6129,0.9829,1.2668,0.9645,0.062,0.0014,0.9821,3.4224,5.1555,3.4884,0.0009,6.1241,0.0179,1.4899,5.4667,1.6872,3.0028,0.1519,1.75,7.6766,1.4535,2.1585,3.1581,0.4304,4.0947,0.001,0.0075,0.0208,0.8066,0.0138,2.1427,0.3981,0.5792,1.638,0.0262,1.0716,2.3781,3.6698,2.7186,3.758,0.998,2.6114,1.2996,4.2853,3.683,0.1203,3.3926,1.3861,1.1134,1.2373,1.4943,0.224,0.524,3.7645,4.669,0.0377,1.3883,2.2216,0.2934,0.4312,4.5111,3.9825,3.5699,0.0008,0.769,0.6198,3.9958,3.4626,3.2592,0.0031,4.5111,0.3083,2.0383,0.1726,0.2255,1.9123,2.8846,0.5965,1.1816,1.0429,3.5791,4.3097,1.2999,0.1193,0.5927,0.9715,1.4182,2.8685,1.9717,0.7192,2.5839,0.0029,0.6287,2.9826,2.6309,0.4293,0.9004,0.6916,4.1847,3.869,1.1905,1.5657,0.0188,0.3769,0.3298,6.4426,0.0096,0.6295,2.5866,0.6196,4.0423,0.8869,5.6007,5.6408,3.8096,1.1242,0.5883,2.3323,1.8846,3.6767,5.4786,8.2794,0.5725,0.6135,2.5284,1.1607,0.6056,2.8834,0.1259,2.349,0.1239,0.0024,0.0625,5.6776,2.368,0.584,0.1654,4.1351,1.5765,2.5202,1.3212,4.6481,0.002,1.1449,1.0489,0.769,2.6401,3.8692,0.9435,0.1798,1.5737,4.2841,0.5204,0.0293,2.0186,4.279,5.2389,2.0441,2.5551,1.5648,2.8174,0.3082,0.7415,5.6269,1.1469,3.1086,2.0899,5.3316,2.9198,0.1108,2.8319,2.0469,3.0139,1.3569,3.7519,0.2468,2.468,2.3096,0.1545,1.779,1.3664,5.5756,1.1303,2.2925,4.8996,0.3774,0.0007,0.0527,0.0096,0.2705,2.0587,0.7538,5.6526,1.1155,3.4637,1.0759,0.342,2.3006,3.7439,3.869,1.4742,3.2235,0.7148,0.0066,1.5971,0.6316,0.8043,6.6603,0.0193,1.0027,2.1784,5.6752,0.2975,0.0483,3.5699,0.6194,2.9983,0.3333,2.4702,2.9898,1.1953,1.7533,0.784,3.4078,2.148,2.3167,3.9181,0.0157,0.537,2.7135,4.8716,0.2932,1.1499,5.1927,1.1395,3.6386,2.6457,2.1616,0.1458,0.0691,5.3235,0.7665,2.1596,4.5799,0.8039,3.5832,0.6634,0.0135,1.8017,1.7253,5.471,0.0589,2.4464,1.1301,0.9946,2.9779,1.3461,1.0394,3.5707,0.0706,1.0157,2.4392,3.0959,1.417,5.1945,1.3859,2.8358,1.7942,2.7999,1.3102,5.3334,0.1605,3.2481,1.7682,2.6716,1.4301,1.0113,1.3508,3.7635,0.0012,0.1884,4.577,1.0897,1.6316,0.7768,1.4204,0.3534,1.6345,3.942,0.4043,3.4479,1.1241,0.3013,0.4612,2.2665,4.4096,2.0659,1.1997,2.5117,1.6384,1.0573,1.6681,0.1633,0.1188,0.3305,0.6086,1.75,5.0461,0.0415,0.0006,1.7226,0.3934,0.002,3.315,0.6342,5.0303,0.1111,1.5346,3.2985,0.8705,1.048,1.8502,5.0396,1.2186,2.0098,5.5331,2.3904,0.2645,3.4339,0.7738,0.3388,0.2845,3.0408,1.672,0.4508,0.9381,5.4618,2.5213,2.6081,1.4794,3.236,0.083,2.5936,4.2307,1.7249,2.0903,1.5147,4.0846,1.6325,1.6072,1.9882,0.2071,4.2607,2.2885,2.3953,0.32,1.5384,0.5124,0.276,2.7875,0.4662,0.0104,4.1767,4.0991,1.1632,0.0813,2.5306,1.1824,1.1241,2.1748,0.212,1.3766,3.9877,4.4317,1.9017,2.3472,1.75,0.04

{"id":2515,"ended":false,"length":637,"gen_text":"Because of its position more than 2 @, @ 000 miles from the nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawai\u02bbi is one of the most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth ; this in spite of its high latitude and extreme length from earth to moon (approximately 50 times the length of Earth's planet Mercury). Its isolation also makes it one of the most vulnerable to climate change, volcanism, etc.. As such, it has been the site of some dramatic environmental events. During the last decade of the nineteenth century, the island experienced several volcanic events\u2014including one so enormous that it was named Mount Waialeale\u2014resulting in catastrophic destruction of the surrounding area, with more than 200 people killed and over one kilometer of the crater wall destroyed.\n\nBy far, the most dramatic volcanic incident on Hawai\u02bbi was the Kilauea eruption of August 18, 1883, which was nearly as big as the Mt. St. Helens eruption of 1980 and caused the sea level to fall 80 feet, and an estimated $100 billion worth of damage to Hawai\u02bbi during the eruption period. Since that time, Hawai\u02bbi has also seen numerous small eruptions, from small lahars to small lava flows. These events have had some significant consequences. For example, lahars are more common after large eruptions: they also cause more damage to the people and infrastructure on the island. However, small lahars are the main type of eruption associated with the Haleakala volcano system.\n\n\nHaleakala, Hawai\u02bbi\n\n\nAnother important consequence that can be attributed to this island's extremely hostile volcanic environment is that of tephra (ice, rocks, or debris) avalanches. In early January 1984, Hawaiian volcanic authorities noted this \"most unusual\" phenomenon. One eyewitness, a construction worker working below a landslide, observed that a wall of tephra moved at high speed. On February 2, 1984, the same witness watched a wall of lava \"float\" out of a canyon and land on a nearby cliff. In May, a group of students went into the lava tube in the lava lake at the south flank of Haleakala and observed a flash of white \"light\" at the height of 300 feet (91 meters). Another group of students, all of whom were in the same location, spotted a flash of light in the lake in November 1987 and reported that it was followed by the sound of breaking glass. They also thought they heard a loud crack of a hammer being struck.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory\n\n\nAlthough these events were not quite as big as Mount St. Helens, they still had huge impacts on the lives and economy of the island. The total economic cost of the eruption to Hawai\u02bbi was more than $20 million. In January 1980, there was much speculation in the island press as to whether Haleakala would erupt again within the next few months, with the possibility that it could reach its maximum volume\u2014over a trillion cubic feet (2,964,827 cubic meters) \u2014within a few days. Although it's impossible to say for sure, it's clear that Hawaii's volcanoes have the ability to send large volumes of debris into the sky at high speed, which has the potential to cause a great deal

{"id":4580,"ended":true,"length":623,"gen_text":"The Diolkos was a trackway paved with hard limestone with parallel grooves running about 1 @. @ 60 metres ( 63 in ) apart. The roadway was 3 @. @ 4 to 6 metres ( 10 in \/ 20 ins ) deep and generally 1.5 to 2 metres ( 4 in \/10 ins) wide. Its surfaces were generally smooth, and the stones were cut into a variety of forms ranging from oblong-shaped flint-stones arranged in parallel rows to irregular and lancet-shaped 'bricks' each about 10 centimeters ( 3 ft ) wide and 1.5 to 6 centimetres ( 1.5 to 2 in ) thick, with one side of the boulder being covered with a coating of red ochre.... At one end, at a place called Albertsberg, there was a large rectangular block of stone with the same colour and texture as the surrounding rocks, and several large circular grooves had been cut into it. It appeared to be about 80 centimeters ( 32 in ) across at the north-western part and 10 centimetres ( 4 in) tall and 13 centimetres ( 5.5 in) wide at the south-western end. The entire trackway was cut through a flat-topped granite buttress, which could probably have supported a trackstead. When the trackway was excavated in 1900, only a few small parts were found, while the main surface was covered with sand, and at the centre it had been partially covered with a layer of limestone..... The two limestone blocks, together with three small stone flints, were found in a small cave about 50 metres (160 ft) to the east of the main trackway. The rock was covered with a layer of red dirt and the floor of the cave at the rear of the block was in very good condition. The small stones were carefully placed with the heads upwards. No signs of a trackhead or of any remains of occupants were found. They were found almost directly beneath the stones where the stone had fallen with the fall of the hill. This cave is still occupied today. Other archaeological discoveries are reported at the site of the Diolkos. The Diolkos is believed to have been the original burial mound of the Eneolithic age in Germany, a feature of prehistoric culture found in several regions of Western and Central Europe.\n\n[18] This description can be found in:\n\n[19] This map of Germany is taken from:\n\n[20] This description can be found in, by R.

{"id":1140,"ended":true,"length":695,"gen_text":"In all of Latin America, only one other woman has aroused an emotion, devotion and faith comparable to those awakened by the Virgin of Guadalupe. In many homes, the image of the Virgin is one that expresses the true strength of Catholic values. The Virgin of Guadalupe is loved and revered as the powerful example of how to honor the Divine Mary, in whom is contained a power of indescribable power that is God Himself.\n\nThere are no other images and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the globe like this one, so I have called it the Statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe is one that represents the greatest devotion and devotion to the Blessed Virgin since Her birth, with a belief that She will come again for one more time.\n\nThis image, more than any other I have ever seen, reflects the strength of the deep love that exists for the Blessed Virgin Mary. The statue and the statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe are beautiful reminders of the strength and power of faith and devotion that exists everywhere for the Blessed Mother. This statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe and of the church that bears its name remind us that not only is the Mother of God loved by all peoples everywhere, but that She has the power to give her life to each of us every single day because of Her own great love for us.\n\nI pray humbly that the Church will find a way to honor the statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe in every region of the world that has a church with the name of that church. I pray that our Mother will rise up again in Her Mother's glory to give Her life to give us strength and joy in our journey towards God.\n\nWe live in this moment in which time is speeding up, the speed of the Lord's ways is increasing, as He says \" speed is my servant \" (Isaiah 61:2 ), He has called for this because we will not be able to bear our time. Our time is running away with us. I beg that this is not because we will not be able to bear it; but, because He has called for it. Our time moves away from God.\n\nI have prayed that with this prayer that we will find a way to honor the Virgin of Guadalupe with a simple gesture of devotion, and to put forth for her and for all of us, the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, as we go about our lives today. As she gave her life to give us strength to help the world to see that this world needs a strong mother and that the Church needs a strong mother as well. It is a simple thing, a prayer without our words spoken. We pray the prayer over this image, all of these things together.\n\nWhen we walk through life, God is with us. He has been with us always, through every part of our lives, and the beauty, the miracle, the miracle of life in Christ is in our lives.\n\nI pray that the Angelic Sisters will use their gifts in their devotion for this beautiful statue of Mary of Guadalupe, and that they will give great comfort to the faithful of the world here in Mexico. Let us pray in Latin for the protection and for the protection and for the protection of the beautiful gift to give to the world, for the Virgin of Guadalupe. She is the most perfect of women, the strongest of women, and she is the Virgin of hope; we know that the power of God moves in this very Church of God.\n\nThe prayer above can be heard here.","token_len":742,"entropy":[5.518,2.3541,9.2664,0.0385,0.3323,2.717,2.8467,2.9005,5.0364,0.7298,10.9658,5.7322,5.9177,4.9999,6.9328,0.8822,6.0964,3.4391,0.1079,4.0219,6.4427,0.3971,1.5057,5.0247,1.0682,0.3232,0.0169,0.0155,1.2959,2.68,5.9895,7.531,1.2173,1.8379,2.952,0.0513,0.9293,0.3879,1.9215,4.4415,2.2883,5.5883,1.1643,5.4909,5.3038,0.3682,4.2681,4.3569,0.8866,2.3212,2.2825,1.3057,0.0127,0.0005,0.0019,1.0268,5.3002,1.2213,1.2975,1.477,1.5086,5.9133,4.3446,0.1557,4.2996,1.1246,4.9503,1.5293,4.2529,5.2372,1.8592,4.2334,3.0675,2.7169,2.8473,3.8022,2.4567,2.5798,4.8554,0.7097,0.0001,0.0299,1.5143,2.9421,2.1145,5.493,1.4201,0.2403,1.3387,0.0195,4.8263,1.158,3.0234,2.4614,1.4757,5.5242,2.014,0.7129,0.3474,0.2691,0.5912,0.0016,0.0009,0.0022,4.4005,0.6331,3.4314,3.6728,1.9639,0.5385,1.945,4.1822,3.6047,2.6213,4.531,1.148,0.6893,6.1641,0.0182,0.4429,0.2285,0.0984,0.0079,0.0018,0.0013,0.3722,2.3997,1.4574,2.6387,0.1906,0.0588,0.3931,0.0026,0.0008,0.0009,1.086,2.9583,1.4398,3.5587,0.6508,4.6951,3.4279,1.0929,1.4175,0.8251,0.4126,2.0834,0.1738,6.1569,5.7853,1.8839,2.5867,5.1306,1.8563,5.8732,0.6438,3.2473,2.4853,3.3567,0.8755,4.3192,4.5341,4.3848,1.1314,1.3153,1.1045,0.0001,2.9113,3.4944,3.1786,5.674,0.074,0.31,0.1384,4.0295,0.362,0.9943,1.0474,0.1622,4.2699,0.369,3.493,0.4186,0.8629,6.2358,1.9794,1.5437,1.0177,1.6922,0.5208,1.1916,0.0986,1.7041,1.0654,2.1399,2.2458,5.144,1.0074,2.3423,0.4661,0.1345,0.0616,0.1333,0.0024,0.0007,0.0009,1.0944,5.3556,2.6965,0.4249,0.4564,2.7072,1.6215,1.4334,0.2472,2.4941,1.4471,0.2573,1.0909,1.1735,5.4399,3.4333,0.3701,1.8025,2.0707,1.1169,3.4123,1.8258,1.7561,0.0472,0.0458,0.1631,0.0013,0.0003,0.0006,4.0063,2.9477,0.6169,6.4725,1.8995,2.352,2.3677,0.6379,3.8401,0.2468,0.8319,5.5528,0.2676,1.6744,0.9471,3.7149,0.1224,0.2818,2.0495,1.6216,1.446,4.4813,4.3742,0.2011,0.1366,0.7933,1.8727,2.565,1.8635,0.5153,0.2557,4.3932,3.0757,1.8176,1.2139,3.893,1.3604,0.2727,4.8038,2.5783,0.1064,5.499,1.0836,1.8666,3.4597,4.3986,0.5726,0.9736,0.36,0.1843,0.5212,0.0002,2.2596,2.8061,5.4,0.0006,0.6492,1.5023,4.3776,1.5431,4.2201,1.4639,0.2084,0.1042,1.6348,0.8689,4.0107,0.2331,0.0391,0.028,0.0438,0.0012,0.0004,0.0005,1.8875,2.6634,3.8977,0.5052,0.4502,0.1636,2.9823,1.2232,1.0625,3.4848,3.0741,2.0781,0.4555,0.5707,4.8917,1.1134,1.0048,1.2046,0.4211,0.5291,4.1448,4.4591,1.3454,5.2155,1.3753,2.2916,1.5559,5.1218,3.7576,0.3881,3.887,2.1666,2.5571,2.6921,0.7904,0.4382,5.9132,0.9167,2.64,1.0191,3.7802,1.9579,1.2032,4.7247,3.6721,2.4647,0.3964,0.8375,0.0001,4.1297,4.4852,0.1962,5.0062,2.6237,1.0008,0.9107,5.6991,0.9393,2.6606,0.427,1.4925,2.9897,4.2714,0.1835,1.6318,4.3327,1.3323,4.5117,1.2402,1.8587,0.688,3.8492,1.1408,4.7963,3.6314,6.8444,2.7726,2.4984,2.8816,1.5677,0.8624,4.0473,0.0528,3.9899,0.0382,2.4137,6.6641,3.9409,2.7904,4.782,4.5024,4.1642,5.1735,2.7698,4.2602,2.5326,1.1379,0.3722,0.021,4.2382,3.2474,3.9753,1.8381,4.1061,0.958,0.4718,2.6495,3.6271,4.1771,0.0093,0.9664,3.1659,5.2564,2.1555,3.3159,3.9133,0.849,3.4991,1.0453,4.3722,0.6633,0.5762,0.3722,0.0277,0.6367,0.622,4.0775,1.7296,3.5299,1.7742,2.4755,1.0681,0.4335,1.473,0.653,0.8467,4.3003,0.5746,6.9237,4.9813,1.2328,3.3912,1.629,1.8703,0.0002,1.9591,3.3452,2.7882,1.6304,5.7089,1.5533,2.303,2.9565,1.4032,1.2244,2.5622,0.6269,0.0761,0.1943,1.1216,0.4931,0.8955,0.1012,0.0014,0.0006,0.0005,3.6867,1.7234,4.9626,2.7526,1.4862,2.0012,1.8074,2.5294,2.2671,4.9319,3.8179,5.5109,1.2569,4.0255,0.4344,1.3674,1.1113,0.1677,2.4299,1.693,3.5448,0.2178,0.652,0.9086,0.2679,0.0017,0.0004,0.0006,1.7242,3.1267,2.3522,4.3062,3.2263,0.526,1.7587,4.3794,0.8019,4.3882,5.1577,4.2265,1.5029,0.0849,0.9468,0.7404,0.2316,0.988,2.2561,5.9986,3.5781,0.8353,1.9907,3.0549,2.815,4.3887,1.8016,3.5343,2.4094,3.8202,3.5751,2.4999,1.5271,2.1009,2.8142,1.1408,0.5496,0.4854,0.573,4.0186,0.5829,0.246,4.5834,0.2553,2.751,2.9882,3.7023,1.2151,2.524,2.8812,5.7093,6.5897,2.309,6.1522,1.943,2.4859,2.6527,3.1677,1.5657,5.7692,3.102,1.2277,1.5908,6.8737,0.9223,3.98,1.1386,3.1386,1.2622,0.891,0.0002,4.9311,1.0065,5.0704,1.9064,3.5038,0.7434,4.8872,1.3673,2.1677,0.013,1.0297,1.5654,3.1724,2.3531,0.3483,0.1305,4.7938,1.2413,3.9536,2.1015,4.5728,0.0369,0.2682,0.6683,1.0027,1.3006,4.6706,4.8551,3.1665,0.7338,6.0839,1.0353,0.5496,3.9234,0.3108,2.4955,3.4238,2.0263,0.7614,3.5265,2.216,1.879,0.7077,2.72,0.0001,1.9737,1.6303,0.5377,1.8434,6.307,2.9447,1.5177,1.1745,5.8609,1.5372,2.7554,2.6034,3.2308,4.7002,3.9385,2.7277,3.4791,0.9756,0.46,4.3701,1.3323,0.0041,0.0009,0.0008,1.0026,0.7899,1.0002,1.533,0.1253,3.7773,5.7569,5.1381,0.4613,1.3514,2.6528,2.0779,1.9725,1.3213,6.4846,1.0683,0.8347,1.6917,4.7936,0.4722,1.0606,3.9057,5.6972,1.6983,0.6449,4.8042,1.4359,2.6303,0.2135,2.2277,2.5768,0.5287,0.1849,0.3071,0.1186,0.8277,4.3158,7.3983,5.8533,3.418,1.2164,0.8228,0.1471,1.2436,2.9905,0.5913,2.4824,0.1161,0.0023,0.0006,0.0007,0.7312,5.3209,0.6491,1.3165,2.9053,3.4309,2.1942,2.0072,0.8949,1.5716,4.9861,0.7404,0.1512,0.3584,1.2922,1.7091,0.7481,1.0547,4.3518,0.4885,5.5573,5.2358,3.5434,3.9302,0.6344,2.47

{"id":2581,"ended":true,"length":672,"gen_text":"Soon after returning from Flanders, the bishop was impeached in parliament, on 26 October 1383, in the presence of the king. The chancellor Michael de la Pole accused him of not paying church contributions, that are the duties taken by the clergy to the church and to the poor.\n\nIn 1381, the king was granted the bishopric of Worcester in Middlesex, a city of the king's birth, and he gave the title of bishop of Worcester to his nephew and heir, Richard.\n\nHe also appointed Francis de Cuymbre as his secretary and secretary-at-law, and Thomas de Montagu as clerk of the chancery.\n\nIn the king's will of 1397, Charles II named Henry as his second heir ; this was confirmed by a charters of the bishop of London.\n\nIn April 1398, a report was published calling into question the queen's claim to the throne. The report noted the king's increasing age and the difficulty he faced in acquiring followers to aid in the war against the Scots.\n\nIn 1401 during the invasion of Scotland by the forces of Edward IV, in the same city which the bishops of London had been in 1389, the king declared himself Edward V and went on to win an entire kingdom.\n\nKing Henry IV\n\nIn 1404, the king returned to England, having been victorious in northern France and northern Italy, where he defeated the Scots, gained an empire and had his sister, Mary, crowned the Queen Regent of England.\n\nIn that same year, the king asked the council of London to grant him access to church-property and he declared his intention to take the kingdom from the Scots, then holding the majority of the land. In February 1405, Henry died and his son, Richard, was proclaimed king.\n\nIn July 1406, the council of London voted to appoint the younger Henry king. The young prince had been made earl of Warwick and by the council of London, it appeared that Henry was the rightful heir to the throne. In November, he won an overwhelming victory over the Scots at Crecy. During his victory, Henry captured the castle at Agincourt and took control of the southern third of England. Henry's victory was decisive.\n\nWhen Henry died, the kingdom reverted back to the crown of Henry V, though several of the lords in the ruling house of York still claimed the throne. Henry's younger brother, Henry VI, succeeded him to the English throne.\n\nHenry VII\n\nAt the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1452, Henry VIII gained a stunning victory over his younger brother, Prince Edward, who was mortally wounded and never recovered from his wounds. The king died after seven days of a very violent illness, on 27 August 1452.\n\nWhen Henry's father, William II, died on 13 July 1461, the queen was crowned King Mary I by a special council of her nobles on 27 July at Lambeth Palace in London.\n\nIt was in the reign of Mary's youngest brother, Henry VIII, that England became a republic. It was in Mary I's reign that England became a centre of religious reform and the Protestant Reformation took off. It also provided the perfect opportunity for Queen Mary to demonstrate her capacity to rule and gain the throne.\n\nThis was done by marrying her father's third son, King Richard III in July 1485.

{"id":4883,"ended":false,"length":684,"gen_text":"In August and September 2011, SeaWorld Entertainment filed trademarks for `` Antarctica `` to be used for a theme area, and `` Empire of the Penguins `` to be used for an amusement park ride. The company also filed several similar applications in January and February of 2012, none of which have been granted.\n\nSeaWorld's CEO has denied that the company's goal is to make animal entertainment a tourist attraction, rather than a place for marine mammals. [ 5 ] During a live interview on the company's annual shareholder meeting on April 26, 2012, he stated, \"I think animals were actually the original focus... We have been very clear that we will leave the people who enjoy killer whales and dolphins alone.\"\n\nSeaWorld's initial public offering (IPO) was the largest of any company in the United States at $18.1 billion on November 29, 2012. The company has experienced record yearly financial performance, including $7.0 billion in net profit for the fourth quarter of 2012. In its investor relations page, the company points out the difference between its attendance and its revenue during the fourth quarter of 2012 vs. the comparable period in 2011.\n\nSeaWorld's attendance for 2011 was 7.8 million, up 1.2% from 2010, but down 12.0% from 2006. Seaworld continues to focus on maximizing its profitability for its share price, and is working on improving its guests' \"unwanted behavior\" in order to provide an experience similar to those of its Hollywood counterparts. [ 6 ] At the same time, that revenue is declining, due to three consecutive annual declines in attendance. By December 2012, attendance in Orlando had decreased 9% year-over-year, including 15% year-over-year declines for both daytime and night time attendance, compared with an 8.7% decline for all of 2011. [ 7 ]\n\nSeaWorld announced March 28, 2012 that they are expanding their San Diego parks' whale shows for the first time ever over the next two years, in addition to increasing the size and number of exhibits, creating new features, and adding new attractions. [ 8 ]\n\nSeaWorld, through its \"Resolution to Reduce Underwater Injury Events,\" has pledged $12.5 million to help reduce injuries to dolphins and whales, and help prevent injuries to humans in the water. [ 9 ] The company also began a yearlong initiative in 2012 to make its SeaWorld parks safer for visitors and employees. They now feature a system to test and evaluate new design features. [ 9 ]\n\nOn May 11, 2012, a man jumped into the water at the top of the park. Although he was rescued, that was after he had jumped from more than 50 feet below and was already swimming dangerously. [ 10 ] On April 9, 2012, a man died from a cardiac arrest after he entered the park and got entangled in the chain that controls the whale-park's diving machines. [ 10 ]\n\nThe day after the man died, in a statement, SeaWorld said the park had improved its procedures for entering the water. [ 11 ] That same day, the company announced that it would no longer accept visitors who had not signed an agreement to limit their activities in the water. [ 11 ]\n\nAlthough SeaWorld is located in Southern California, and has been known to hold public performances to raise money for charities, critics believe the park's use of captive captive killer whales to entertain guests is detrimental to the well-being of the animals.

{"id":205,"ended":true,"length":648,"gen_text":"Nathan was promoted to the San Francisco Giants on April 20, 1999, taking the roster spot of superstar slugger Barry Bonds, who went on the disabled list after left elbow surgery.\n\nNathan was in the thick of major league baseball in the 1990s, playing for the Giants and San Diego Padres. He batted.306 for the Giants in 1991,.329 for San Diego in 1992 and.309 with the Padres for 1993.\n\nHe was also a productive and reliable player during his eight-year career on the diamond, hitting.279 with 1,110 hits, 612 runs, 341 doubles, 1,070 RBI and 462 stolen bases in 1,158 games.\n\nHe finished his playing career looking like a good fit for a team such as the Braves: an above-average offensive catcher with solid defense.\n\nHere's the big takeaway from our research into Nathan:\n\nNathan wasn't a great hitter during the first half of his big league career. He hit.284 with an.820 OPS and only hit.231 at San Diego.\n\nAt age 29, Nathan had hit.260 with a.828 OPS. He was playing for the Padres and had a 3.8 fWAR through his first 43 games.\n\nNow, Nathan was the worst hitter through the first 43 games of his 2000 season (5 games with the Padres and then 2 games with the Giants). He finished the season with a.231 batting average.\n\nHe was a poor offensive catcher over the course of his eight-year career as well, hitting.255 over the course of those seasons. Yet Nathan was very valuable in that role as an offensive weapon, as he averaged 1.8 fWAR during the years he batted.300,.303 and.303 with an.806 OPS.\n\nThe bottom line: Nathan was a very productive and reliable player with the Giants in the 1990s. He wasn't great at one part of his career (the first half of the 2000s) and he wasn't great at another (through the last three years).\n\nIn other words, Nathan was good for a team, not great.\n\nIf you dig deeper, the big takeaway is that despite the fact he hit some home runs during his rookie year, you can't be sure if that was a function of him being in one place and the team being in another.\n\nNathan wasn't great in Atlanta because the Braves didn't really want him -- the ballclub had just won the World Series with Tim Wallach as its new hitting coach.\n\nThe Giants needed a player they could trust. What did they have? The best hitter in the minors at the time, Joe Mauer.\n\nThe Giants needed a player they could trust. What did they have? Tim Lincecum.\n\nNathan couldn't be sure if the Atlanta Braves needed a player he was better than to win games. How much would it hurt his ego if he gave them a free pass for one start in the National League Championship Series against the Dodgers?\n\nIt was a small move in the grand scheme of things, but it showed a guy with big-league baseball savvy and an ability to read hitters. He would be perfect for San Francisco.\n\n\"If it was in San Francisco, it might not have been too bad for him,\" one NL executive said back when the deal was first rumored in 1999.\n\n\"If it was the Dodgers, I might not have said (much).

{"id":4755,"ended":false,"length":700,"gen_text":"Three days after the Brazilian Grand Prix, reports began to surface suggesting that Sebastian Vettel's championship was under threat and that Ferrari would be filing a formal protest against the race results.\n\nHowever, that idea fell flat when it emerged that the team had sent a fax to the FIA with evidence that would have enabled them to lodge the protest, and that in the time it took to investigate the circumstances under which the stewards had determined that the race should be cancelled before it had begun, the driver team had made a significant and significant financial gain from the actions of the marshals.\n\nWith the FIA already convinced that the incident was a matter of 'extreme importance,' the team decided that they could not wait around for a tribunal hearing, since they wanted to see F1's governing body in an official capacity, so they called in the media to tell their side of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Telegraph relayed, after Ferrari's fax had been rejected, it got the FIA's permission to speak to the media again. They then contacted the stewards, who denied their request.\n\nAt that point, the team decided to press for a grandstand protest and on October 9, following the third and final race of the season, the FIA issued a press release stating that they would accept a formal protest, but one that would be submitted by the team \"in a timely manner and in good faith.\"\n\nThe next day, Ferrari's complaint was forwarded to the stewards for further investigation, and on October 10, they sent a two page report to the FIA outlining their case, and declaring that the case against Ferrari was \"not supported by any evidence and lacks material basis\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, it emerged that the FIA had had a number of discussions in the weeks prior to publishing their findings with the team, and concluded that their case was weak in both its legal and factual aspects, and that F1's governing body would not be filing the formal protest.\n\nWhile FIA president Jean Todt stated in a press release at the time that the decision was \"not a political decision,\" it was clear that the decision was ultimately driven by the way in which the team responded to the initial rejection of their complaint.\n\nDespite its initial stance, the FIA did eventually agree to a formal protest, and after the stewards' report were submitted to the Grand Prix Commission, F1's management accepted that the case against Ferrari would remain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the stewards' ruling was that \"if the conduct of the marshals who, in this case, acted in a high level of professionalism, cannot be judged to be sufficiently serious to have affected the outcome of the race, and if there is any other legal basis for the complaint, then the FIA would not bring any action.\"\n\nIn summary, the stewards believed there was enough evidence to prosecute the FIA on several grounds, including negligence, unfair playing field practices, and a lack of regard for the sporting objectives of F1 and F1 cars, and they sent the case for a hearing by the stewards of the FIA's Court of Arbitration of Sport. It was at that hearing that the Stewards could declare that F1's governing body would not bring any proceedings against the team, due to their actions simply being \"not supported by any evidence and

{"id":3102,"ended":false,"length":718,"gen_text":"On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, `` Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in the same universe, in the same Marvel multiverse, but the tone and the genre -- in other words, the things that feel real and grounded to you, that you're really excited about watching -- are very different.'' Rosenberg explained that he didn't set out to make a dark show and that the Marvel creative team didn't push him on that. He wanted to make a show that felt unique and interesting.\n\nHe's also taken note of the fans' love of Marvel's heroes. To that end, he said Marvel has recently sent him fan mail thanking him for making ``Daredevil'' available through his ``Jessica Jones'' Netflix series. As a result, Rosenberg can't bemoan the fact that Netflix won't be making an ``Arrow'' spinoff for some time. ``My hope is we get it, and there's so much stuff we want to do,'' said Rosenberg. ``But the key is if you want good stories, good characters and great television, you have to give people what they want.''\n\nAnother big change for Netflix in Marvel's world is having full control over the way its content is developed and produced. When it comes to the Marvel world, the network has now hired its own production guru, Marc Guggenheim, the former lead writer on ``Arrow'' and several other television series at DC Comics.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with characters from past Marvel series, Rosenberg said, ``We're extremely careful to avoid any conflicts of interest. If we're using someone from, say, 'The Incredible Hulk' and you're using their character in this, we have to be very careful that we're not putting the two stories in conflict. I didn't want to do that in any case. The other thing we did is that we have this board of superhero advisers, and the members are chosen by the executives at Marvel. So when you hire Marc, he is an advisor for the next season.''\n\nMarvel's Marvel, Marvel's Marvel\n\nMarvel's overall philosophy when it comes to TV series remains the same. ``What I am trying to do on television is very simple,'' said Rosenberg. ``Have great superheroes. Have engaging heroes who are flawed. Make them relatable. Let them go on an adventure. Make it challenging. They'll do anything for you to take away their powers.''\n\nIn the meantime, viewers are eagerly awaiting the premieres of two new series from Netflix. Rosenberg noted that the Marvel universe -- including all of that fan-favorite superhero stuff -- is expected to grow again for Season One of ``Jessica Jones.''\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix's announcement that `` Daredevil'' also will be renewed for a second season comes as no surprise. The drama continues to score rave reviews from critics and a strong fanbase. For fans, that's good news and better news for Marvel and Netflix.\n\nFor Netflix, ``Daredevil'' has clearly brought in the subscribers it was also hoping to lure in to the streaming service. Rosenberg said that ``this show continues to be a big success'' for Netflix. He also credited the studio behind ``Daredevil'' with making it the superhero genre's next big thing.\n\nAs for Season 2, which will begin production later this year in New York, Rosenberg is confident that the series has as much going for it as the first season. ``The characters are great,'' he said. ``I feel very good with the way the show is coming together as far as the characters are concerned.''","token_len":745,"entropy":[10.9602,6.6804,2.4099,8.9706,0.6452,0.6598,7.888,1.8157,1.1059,6.7801,4.4437,0.7789,1.6315,3.7854,6.1373,1.4635,0.7087,9.9782,1.6542,2.0064,10.4244,13.1985,0.1215,1.1792,1.4832,2.0177,3.1002,0.0111,0.9311,0.7268,1.5763,0.4056,1.0381,2.6862,9.5899,0.1545,2.0961,0.2066,1.5589,0.8878,4.2213,0.4788,0.0513,3.2999,4.3594,0.0013,0.6054,0.4371,2.6734,1.9711,1.0531,0.4869,5.4609,6.5834,3.8197,4.5868,0.0047,0.059,0.6119,5.2497,0.3153,6.7617,4.464,0.9667,2.1144,3.38,2.8357,1.536,2.3397,1.8187,2.895,3.457,3.9617,0.9237,2.3467,0.7624,1.3796,0.8448,0.1196,2.7003,3.74,3.4116,0.4838,2.838,4.3777,0.0006,4.5151,0.0257,0.0979,1.0802,0.5102,3.9094,0.8627,3.6083,1.129,1.6027,5.0324,5.7104,0.3283,3.2107,0.0003,2.6717,0.5491,4.3886,1.2457,1.2007,2.5044,4.863,0.293,1.0575,0.4441,0.6551,0.5611,1.6711,5.154,1.0208,3.1942,1.3785,2.3046,0.0027,3.6278,4.6986,1.6332,5.1411,3.5022,0.1502,0.9341,3.9885,0.9574,4.3989,1.1121,4.215,0.9918,3.378,1.3341,5.8726,1.4161,0.0618,0.0161,1.07,1.302,4.5405,1.3001,4.9938,5.4051,0.7506,1.8531,1.6784,4.0032,0.1201,0.1054,1.7853,2.7071,2.8435,0.0006,0.9293,4.4282,4.4621,3.8507,4.908,0.4284,0.016,0.2802,1.5898,0.2244,0.2164,4.9484,1.4032,0.4363,0.1383,0.9303,6.6853,0.9938,3.9512,5.5048,0.0011,0.567,1.2192,0.0717,3.4278,3.8158,0.0024,0.7616,3.2132,3.7746,1.468,5.5304,0.0765,0.0313,2.5937,0.1541,3.0044,4.3537,0.0198,0.4019,1.3495,4.5707,2.2554,0.2143,4.1093,2.6167,5.069,3.7448,1.619,4.3229,0.5905,4.9712,0.2649,4.1295,1.9192,1.4942,0.0254,0.2222,2.3756,3.433,0.0165,0.2041,0.3226,2.2887,2.9509,5.6727,0.6711,3.8605,2.2751,2.4437,8.617,2.4134,0.4654,2.6415,0.2949,1.6143,2.343,5.2647,0.2027,0.7311,0.7966,0.0117,4.608,2.0615,0.8053,0.0136,0.0727,0.9021,0.4904,0.0003,5.5578,3.5609,2.0657,1.3381,3.3261,2.0314,4.068,0.5823,2.4712,0.539,6.1608,6.1632,1.0823,0.3954,1.2528,4.3357,1.6735,2.4503,0.2506,3.8917,1.3799,1.6643,0.1585,4.8623,2.4117,0.5104,0.0158,1.7691,2.491,4.6331,0.1057,2.3274,3.1517,1.4093,5.7168,5.3885,1.4553,0.0757,2.8613,5.1908,0.4028,4.5544,0.5447,0.0001,0.0,0.0003,0.3751,3.5535,2.2895,5.1924,0.5211,1.2716,1.5825,1.6693,0.0144,0.9995,0.1701,6.1783,0.6042,4.3542,0.9149,4.0177,1.7105,0.5326,0.2783,1.6709,0.0003,4.1808,1.638,0.0748,0.0088,5.7668,0.017,4.0743,1.4749,6.9545,1.41,2.9024,0.2259,0.5268,0.4037,1.3507,0.1471,1.328,1.4259,5.8276,2.3091,1.8402,3.7209,2.0066,3.8262,2.2496,0.1986,1.2203,3.104,1.0925,1.9045,4.7803,2.4151,0.5443,4.9607,0.154,0.013,3.0752,2.18,2.3766,0.0005,0.7271,2.2169,5.2471,0.5075,2.1206,5.9142,1.4146,1.2433,3.7567,1.8868,1.4037,2.0701,0.2439,1.7885,0.8978,0.4949,1.7447,1.076,0.6334,0.1638,3.4785,2.2998,1.9581,4.111,0.5915,0.1556,1.4115,3.475,6.3394,0.0003,0.5367,0.4385,1.5319,1.2597,1.5737,2.9998,3.0375,1.4011,3.5013,3.3267,0.3996,1.4538,2.6345,1.3079,2.6492,0.5597,2.7515,4.7526,5.5496,0.8233,5.03,2.0693,1.3989,0.975,3.3164,4.6539,1.4569,3.6861,0.4541,1.3115,3.8086,1.2357,0.4906,0.9522,1.9743,3.6973,2.4364,4.2587,2.6184,0.7322,1.1372,3.1918,3.9204,3.2927,3.3032,1.295,2.6372,2.7018,2.7622,0.2227,0.0003,4.0814,1.2645,4.3209,5.4249,3.8917,0.8239,0.2245,0.5169,0.0002,3.4649,0.8243,5.1913,3.7379,3.2875,0.065,0.013,0.0031,3.3443,3.2578,4.3914,0.6092,0.004,1.5304,1.1988,4.1504,2.3671,5.2431,2.4692,0.0044,0.3251,3.5152,2.7039,0.2008,5.3636,3.7314,0.813,0.2966,0.2646,0.0913,0.0146,6.7685,2.2969,6.6663,1.4381,2.5096,5.3929,2.7438,2.6143,0.8776,3.1655,1.5051,3.2379,1.2072,1.2531,0.0,0.8594,3.964,0.8835,4.4985,2.2746,3.0188,0.1101,1.0889,3.3606,2.7919,5.8756,1.064,5.6689,3.8992,3.3087,2.3041,1.9483,1.5429,3.1718,5.7817,3.8272,0.7958,1.1666,1.6087,0.3185,0.0003,3.1226,1.6506,3.5023,0.0098,4.7295,3.0683,2.8704,0.4382,0.5679,6.1648,0.0009,0.0737,4.1284,1.347,1.6128,2.6532,1.8979,1.191,2.9437,4.1588,0.2155,1.5836,4.0837,2.7134,5.2878,2.251,2.7948,0.8525,7.284,5.1089,0.9762,0.3461,3.108,2.1956,0.2698,0.8857,5.4311,0.0082,2.4865,5.8798,3.6206,4.4174,6.2888,0.564,0.5028,1.0273,0.0021,0.388,1.6558,0.0003,4.3965,0.016,2.5995,2.0606,5.4135,1.4209,2.2286,4.9803,0.0716,7.374,0.569,0.9222,4.3015,0.4461,0.6895,0.138,0.0289,4.1004,0.8286,1.0852,0.1219,0.9108,2.4476,4.8945,5.1274,0.042,4.9297,2.9377,0.0079,1.2566,0.1023,0.5904,5.0033,3.0108,3.7971,0.7003,4.347,3.3463,1.1368,2.9031,1.4214,2.4864,0.0933,2.5828,5.2703,0.4673,0.7919,1.6996,2.8822,0.3695,0.3011,0.8778,0.0003,2.35,3.7405,0.1188,2.153,0.4879,0.0002,0.0859,1.9352,5.967,5.3016,0.8253,1.7875,2.7289,1.7343,1.101,6.0199,1.5787,1.0799,3.3196,1.6598,4.5301,1.2927,0.8824,0.2186,0.2051,2.8779,0.9829,1.6034,2.5874,4.8256,2.5045,3.3146,0.03,1.3428,1.2621,2.242,1.4623,3.25,1.2562,0.6497,0.9802,2.6522,1.7147,3.3732,0.7454,4.5287,4.3304,1.2276,0.0793,0.0001,0.3388,1.3792,2.4,1.7685,2.7188,6.122,4.8155,1.1776,2.8165,0.634,0.7775,0.195,1.1407,0.0003,3.5795,0.1967,4.6057,2.7596,0.9813,3.2279,1.3108,2.9987,1.0827,2.7965,0.0302,0.3297,3.2013,0.9298,0.0378,0.5539,0.1429,3.4979,2.6076,0.7782,1.4555,2.0692,3.4023,5.4741,0.4996,3.8223,0.0516,0.0062,0.1495,1.3305,0.3455,0.4574,0.7359,0.3584,2.4742,3.529,0.4262,4.0452,1.5447,0.3291,0

{"id":1138,"ended":true,"length":684,"gen_text":"Shortly after Evita's death, plans were made to construct a memorial in her honour. The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the descamisados, was projected onto the spot where Evita fell. The ceremony was held in the home of Pedro Aguilar, the brother of Evita's husband and her former lover, and the first stage of the new monument was launched on April 16, 1936.\nWith the help of some volunteers, a small and fragile statue of Evita's face and the initials C.K were sculpted on the spot where Evita fell, surrounded by some flowers. The statue was then presented to the people who were present at the ceremony; a small crowd gathered for the unveiling, as well as a large one. The sculptors, who were all members of the Lares y La Luna (Little Leaguers) community, had no idea where the sculpture would be placed. The monument had to be relocated several times, most notably during the Second Civil Contingency in the following year, which took place on April 14, 1937.\nOn May 9th, 1937, the monument stood in the plaza of the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C. The day before, the American Ambassador, Edwin C. Johnson, had arrived in Buenos Aires, to give the official approval to the monument which was set on the spot where Evita fell.\nOn December 8th, 1937, the dedication ceremony was commemorated with a banquet in the Ambassador's residence. On December 14th, 1938, a new replica of the statue was erected in the plaza of the Spanish Embassy in Washington.\nThe statue was initially named \"Maria Noguera Aguilar, \" and was the sole contribution of Noga, a sculptor who died two days before the dedication. One of the organizers of the ceremony was Evita's stepmother Paula Fernandez.\nIn the decade before her death, Noga had been influenced by the life of the poet Alberto Guerrero, her idol during her younger days. He had said many times that it was possible for a woman to become a great poet. Noga decided that she had to pay homage to the great poet and so her sculpture took on the shape of Evita and was named \"Maria Noguera Guerrero, \" a title that was given by the Spanish President, General Alfonso Lopez Mateos. The Spanish government accepted Noga's decision, on the condition that after 10 years of ownership, the statue would be returned to her.\nWhen she died two years after, her wife Paula wrote an article for her column \"La Prensa\" - \"Woman\", in which she discussed the importance of painting the face of a woman, to recognize our own gender. Paula had the statue casted again, for a third time. In the years that followed there was much speculation as to who the sculptor was, and several theories were posted on the Internet. The latest theory is that it was Jose Vidal - a Mexican artist who had no association with the statue.\nThe statue was given to the Spanish Embassy in the United States of America in 1962, and to the National Museum in Buenos Aires in 1970. The most recent replacement of the original is a bronze statue placed in the Plaza of the Americas in Buenos Aires, in 1985.\nAs well as a statue, the memorial is a large number of letters sent by the Evita Carranza family in tribute to Eva, which are kept as part of the permanent exhibit. There are also photos and newspaper clippings, which have been translated into English and made available to the public through the American Evita Foundation for Argentine

{"id":4047,"ended":true,"length":670,"gen_text":"Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City, Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion were all rumoured to be interested in Matthews in the wake of his appearance for England Schoolboys. The Stoke City manager Tom Hughes would go on to sign the 19-year-old in the \u00a335,000-a-week second tier for \u00a31m in September 2009.\nAn FA report found that Matthews had played no major role in West Ham's promotion to the Premier League or its successful promotion campaign and Matthews agreed to a \u00a335,000-a-week deal with West Ham. However, it is thought he was unhappy that West Ham have since finished in 9th position, which was more than three points behind their rivals for promotion. As a result, West Ham will not receive bonus points from the Premier League for any season that Matthews features in.\nMatthews moved to Aston Villa in the summer of 2010, becoming the second highest paid player in its recent history, while the deal included a significant bonus payment of \u00a31m, with bonuses being calculated using points and the difference between a player's appearances.\nVilla won the Premier League title in Matthew's first season in the English top flight, although he struggled to make a significant impression with just one goal and one assist from 22 appearances. Villa recorded a profit of \u00a31m from Matthews' transfer fee, however, which was shared with the rest of the squad.\nMatthews spent his first two seasons at Villa without any prolific form despite the huge increase in his wages. He scored a few crucial goals during the 2012\/13 season as Villa won the Championship play-off final, but this was a season wasted due to injury and poor form. During the first half of season, Villa only managed to concede 21 goals, but only after their relegation in August 2013.\nMatthews has recently gone onto sign a five-year contract with Birmingham City, paying him \u00a3100,000-a-week. He will be paid \u00a345,000-a-week over the next two seasons after signing a contract extension back in January with the Blues, who will be vying for promotion to the Premier League next season.\nMatthews, who was linked with a move to Stoke City in the summer of 2011, remains the highest paid player at Birmingham. The winger scored 10 goals in 35 appearances last season, including one against his former club Chelsea in the FA Cup. If you discount his goal against his old club, the former West Ham man has only scored three goals in 38 appearances over the course of his time at Birmingham. Matt has, however, played in some of Villa's most costly Premier League games of the 2012\/13 season.\nOne of Matt's worst performances of the 2012\/13 season was at Old Trafford. The striker could only manage one goal, all of which came in his last game at Villa Park.\nIn addition, he failed to provide one assist during the season, playing in just eight games. This led the Villa fans to chant his name - and he eventually heard it in front of the bench at Villa Park when he was sent off in his final game in front of the Birmingham fans.\nSpeaking of Villa, they had a disappointing season in the Premier League, coming seventh in the top-flight. The club also had to pay a \u00a310 million fine to the FA for the \"improper conduct\" of two players for betting on football matches.

{"id":254,"ended":true,"length":692,"gen_text":"On September 8, 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. This event holds the record as the United States'deadliest natural disaster. The city was devastated, and more than 20,000 people died. The hurricane was named the Great Miami Hurricane, after its center passed just outside the city on the east coast.\n\nThe city of Miami was rebuilt, its hotels, streets and other buildings were redone, and roads were repaved.\n\nThe site is located in a heavily wooded, swampy area, less than 3 miles west of the northern tip of South Beach, near City Hall. As we enter downtown Miami from the west, we can see the buildings and landmarks of the old city. It has since been completely redeveloped with hotels, office buildings, and retail stores.\n\nWhen we walk to the north along East 14th Street, we come into the heart of the city and are confronted with the magnificent skyline of Miami, its beautiful ocean-front buildings, and beautiful, dramatic views of the Miami River.\n\nWe have seen so many of the city's landmarks in our previous tour, but not in any great detail. This time, we will go on a tour of the main landmarks of the city and discuss some of the most famous buildings in South Beach.\n\nLet's start our tour of the city's main landmarks!\n\nMiami's Old City is the heart of the city, where the most important buildings are built. Just west of the Riverwalk is the Grand Central Market, located directly across the street from Florida's biggest mall.\n\nWe will walk up Florida Avenue and will head north and south along the shore of the Miami River, passing by some of the city's most famous attractions.\n\nThis is Beach Front Park, home to Miami's most famous landmark, the Sun Life Stadium, which was built in 1972 and is one of the largest stadiums in the country. On June 14, 1982, the World Series Championship Game was played at the stadium during the middle game of the season, and with the victory, the Cleveland Indians won the World Series.\n\nAlso in the area is Biscayne Bay Park, a beautiful playground adjacent to the large park where many Miami Dolphins play and events like Dolphin Fest take place.\n\nWe will walk all the way to Overtown, a very desirable and popular neighborhood with its own restaurants, shops, and clubs. We will make the trip to Overtown via the downtown transportation system.\n\nOvertown is home to a large collection of historic, architectural, and architectural treasures, including the main downtown building, Hotel Capri, and the old City Hall, as well as large parking lots and a boat launch, which is one of Miami's biggest attraction.\n\nAlso included on all of our tours is a visit to the historic Florida State Hospital, which is located at 1350 Biscayne Avenue. A prominent historical structure that once served as a psychiatric hospital, Florida State Hospital has long been a focal point of many events in the town.\n\nMiami's most famous landmark, Florida State Hospital, is located across the street from Miami Beach. The hospital originally had a different name in the beginning, but Florida State Hospital is now known as Florida Hospital Miami Beach. The hospital has since seen many renovations to the building, and now houses the psychiatric wing, two ambulatory care centers, a pharmacy clinic, a dental clinic, and a surgery center.

{"id":4431,"ended":true,"length":662,"gen_text":"In 1948, Petoskey returned to the University of South Carolina where he was the head coach of the baseball team until 1956. He also served as an ends coach for the South Carolina Baseball Association in 1952, 1953 and 1955.\n\n\nIt was while at the University of South Carolina where Petoskey began working with the university baseball team. He was a member of the All-American team in 1934 and 1936, and was chosen as the league's coach of the year in 1937. He received a doctorate in journalism and sociology from the University of South Carolina.\n\n\nIn August 1949 he became the new head baseball coach for the Detroit Lions with the National League team. There he would coach the Cleveland Indians from 1950 to 1957.\n\n\nIn 1960, with the Indians the Tigers had a losing record going 32-53. Petoskey, along with assistant Joe Coleman, were in charge of trying to solve the problems that were afflicting the league's best club. The new manager, Johnny Evers, had never won more than seven games in a season during his time as manager of the Cleveland Indians.\n\n\nThey found that the Indians were losing players at a faster rate than any other league in America. Evers began to change the team's philosophy when he altered how they used their pitchers. The Tigers' pitchers were often used to get out their hitters so that they could try to get them out again later. This forced their hitters to swing the bat, and they had more home runs because they were able to attack more often.\n\n\nWhen Petoskey was fired in December 1960 after a poor finish, the Detroit Lions went on to win the pennant in 1961. During that year, the season, Petoskey left a lasting impression on Lions fans and their team. His \"Pitcher's Mind\" is the first book in the franchise's illustrious history.\n\n\nAccording to legend, Petoskey gave up playing in order to make the time on his schedule for a book. He was the first professional baseball coach ever to take his players with him on road trips, and he was famous for spending nearly half of his offseason schedule writing and reading about baseball.\n\n\nA tireless researcher, the Tigers president, Lee McGlothlin, requested Petoskey's help in determining how much he should offer for former star manager Fergie Jenkins, one of the most popular managers in Tigers history. When Petoskey showed McGlothlin the story of Jenkins and his salary demands, McGlothlin offered a raise and took Jenkins, along with many other Tigers players, to Detroit where they were featured in the book \"F.S. Jenkins: The First Hundred Years.\"\n\n\nIn 1965, McGlothlin hired Petoskey again to be the team's coach. He led the Tigers to the World Series championship in 1969 under McGlothlin's new \"Gentleman's Agreement.\"\n\n\nPetoskey returned to the Detroit Tigers in 1977, and led the Tigers to a World Series championship in 1981 in the midst of a historic strike.\n\n\nPetoskey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990, and had a lifelong involvement in the Tigers and their community. In 1980 he founded the Petoskey Foundation which provides youth baseball programs and equipment for impoverished inner city schools.\n\n\nIn 1983 Petoskey published \"The Big Book of Baseball.\" The paperback edition of the book sold more than 10,000 copies and was named the best seller for the year.

{"id":543,"ended":false,"length":699,"gen_text":"In 1993, U2 were in Europe for the `` Zooropa `` leg of their Zoo TV Tour. Before their 3 July show in Verona, Italy, the band received a fax from Bob Geldof that ended with the lines `` I've got the feeling you need to hear this.``\n\n\nBob did have problems with the BBC in the past. In April 2001, he wrote to the BBC `` My request that you publish your agreement with the band U2 after the live concert of my movie is yet to be answered.``\n\n\nHe also wanted to see if it could be possible to make new music with him being one member of the band (U2). There are suggestions that U2 will never work with Bob again because of the controversy about his divorce. A few of Bob's fans have made death threats on his personal web site, and asked that they be posted in the hope that some of the fans would be killed. There are also the suggestions that U2 is afraid of losing fans and are not giving them the full story about the divorce.\n\n\nHowever, some of the comments about his alleged drug abuse may be based on hearsay, as this is a matter for the police to examine.\n\n\nBob is quoted as saying in a 2004 interview on Rolling Stone magazine site (June 2004 )`` I'm not in denial: I know something is wrong.... I think I went out and had a cigarette one time....''\n\n\nIn the USA, several members of U2 ( Bono, The Edge, The Edge's wife, Ali Hewson ) have been interviewed about this controversial episode.\n\n\nIn April 2018, when the band (and Bono) were in Australia, the singer was asked about what he had to say about this issue. When asked at U2's Australian show in Sydney, he said`` My comments I didn't think were very important. They were things that I'd said to myself that were just something I said to myself I was going to say anyway. There was nobody to tell me when you are going to say it.''\n\n\nWhen asked him about the alleged drug use, the singer was quoted as saying: ``When we got back from India it did turn up and I thought it was kind of a surprise and as you can imagine it was difficult at the time to just try and cope with all of the emotions that had just come over me. But I'm now aware of it and I am now really trying to work through that and I think I'm doing really well. My first wife left me some time ago, not this month but a few months before and then I was devastated and then when that was over, and I was thinking, what am I going to do with my time now? And it just all came to a head when I met Ali and there was just a lot less and less to do with the day-to-day things that are going on, so the only time I was able to concentrate and work with a band and really concentrate on the real problems was when I was very, very high. And that is when I saw the light at the end of that tunnel, and I thought, 'OK, I've got to do some time off to work on myself. I'll figure it all out.'\n\nHe continued:'' You might say it was an accident....

{"id":1274,"ended":true,"length":619,"gen_text":"Radiation burns may be caused by protracted exposure to ultraviolet light ( such as from the sun, tanning booths or arc welding ) or from ionizing radiation ( such as from radiation therapy, X-rays, or gamma-ray therapy ).\n\nSymptoms of sunburn vary because varying amounts of ultraviolet B and UVA rays are released to the skin. The Sunburn Treatment Guide describes how your treatment might help.\n\nSunburn Treatment Guide: This guide covers all aspects of sunburn treatment - prevention, detection, treatment and follow-up. It is based on science and clinical experience.\n\nAbout your treatment\n\nIt is important to have the diagnosis right away. There are a variety of reasons for sunburn but for most people, sunburn is a sign of the increased severity of an underlying medical condition:\n\nIf you have burns on your face, you will need skin grafting from the chest area, neck, or other area that is burning. Also, a new skin graft will be needed, so there is a high chance you will need to have treatment for other skin conditions.\n\nIf you have severe burns, you might need medical treatment for radiation poisoning or other conditions - for example, bone marrow transplantation or lymphoproliferative cell (LCL) therapy.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe prognosis of sunburn is usually good, with only a few conditions requiring specialist treatment. This is dependent on the type of sunburn and on the severity of the problem.\n\nLess severe burns will heal on their own. More severe burns are likely to require skin grafting. The healing process will require a minimum of 5-10 weeks.\n\nIt is important to note, though, that the treatment is not perfect. Your treatment might need to be repeated after 5-10 years, depending on your circumstances.\n\nPrevention\n\nSunscreen is essential if you:\n\nStay in the sun for extended periods of time;\n\nGo swimming after 10 pm; or\n\nWear clothes and protective clothing.\n\nSunburn Treatment Guide: This guide covers all aspects of sunburn treatment - prevention, detection, treatment and follow-up. It is based on science and clinical experience.\n\nWhat if I have sunburn without a burn on my face, chest or back?\n\nThis is often called a sunburn without scars. If you had a sunburn that has no burn, but where the sunburn marks are now deeply burned into the skin, then you may need a skin graft from your chest. This skin graft must be new, not re-inflated. You must then wear long-staple clothing that keeps the bandage on for more than 8 weeks.\n\nPrevention\n\nYou can reduce the risk of sunburn by making these changes:\n\nAvoid tanning beds, tanning beds are never \"safe\"\n\nLimit use of UV-blocking clothes, sunscreen does not block UV radiation, and no benefit is gained by UV-blocking clothing\n\nFor children, stay out of the pool, beaches and tanning beds until they are older\n\nFor children under five years of age, wear long-staple clothing covering the entire area of burns.\n\nFor adults:\n\nAvoid using UV-blocking clothing\n\nWear clothing that covers the entire area of burns\n\nWash frequently with soap and water\n\nIn the past, sunburn treatment was largely carried out by the general practitioner, but today most burns (other than on the face, chest and back) need to be treated by a doctor. Some dermatologists are now also qualified in burns

{"id":58,"ended":true,"length":489,"gen_text":"The most successful reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The first is a bicyclic < unk > that has been employed in the synthesis of the \u03b2 @ - @ adrenergic and noradrenergic receptor (R), respectively.[4] The other is a b-hydroxyalkyl alkyl group composed of \u03b1 -hydroxy-cis-2,5-diyltetrahydrocannibin-5-one (4) [ ). The \u03b2 - @ is used in the synthesis of the \u03b1 -bryostimulone-4, \u03b1 -bryostimulone-4a and pyrrolidinonon-3,4- dioxo acids ( ). Both are the second chain esters of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, the primary product being a compound more potent than \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate itself.[5]\n\nThis synthesis can be performed in the presence of an alkyl group (1) to produce phenylacetone and pyrrolizidine analogs; while (3) is used to convert ketone carbonate into \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. These esters have a higher boiling point than their monomethylated counterparts (pyrrolidine acetate being the lowest at 34\u00b0C and phenylacetone the highest at 121\u00b0C). In practice, the alkyl group is readily replaced by the boron group; hence the \u03b2 - @ @ is typically used in the synthesis of 1, 4 and 5 as they share the same melting point (40\u00b0C) and boiling point (101\u00b0C).\n\nIn the case described above, the 1 is used to introduce a \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate derivative in the synthesis of \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate. The phenylacetone derivative is used as a precursor to the acetone product. Since pyrrolidine acetate is typically transformed with the alkyl group to produce phenylacetone, this is replaced by the bORO group (see above ). This is used for the production of the \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate derivative. A single chain ketone (e.g., \u03b2 @ @ ) is used to transform ketone carbonate into the ketone, which is then substituted with the alkoxy group to produce \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate. This product can be converted back to the ketone after it has been oxidized to dihydroxybutyrate.\n\nThe 2 is used to convert \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate to \u03b2-hydroxypropionate and propionate, respectively; this is done by substituting a dihydroxybenzoate with an ester of acetyl carboxylic acid. After this, the \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate is converted back to the \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate derivative used in the synthesis of the \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate analogue, which can be transformed back to \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate following oxidation by ketoacetic acid or methylketone.\n\nThe \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate derivative is obtained by reaction of the monobiotite with an acetone derivative.

{"id":1028,"ended":true,"length":673,"gen_text":"The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade reached Debabis on 8 August. As the 3rd Light Horse Brigade came up, they passed many dead Ottomans and Yeomanry ; one dead Ottoman sniper had a bayonet in one of his eyes. The mounted regiment passed many Turkish riflemen, who were shot through with bayonets. The New Zealanders were surprised to see that in several places the bayonet holes could not be seen, and it is interesting to note that of the 6 men who had bayonet wounds, all 6 were killed on the spot, and none were mortally wounded. The New Zealanders also observed that many of the Ottomans were injured from their fall, but were still shooting. The Ottomans came out of their trenches to shoot the Kiwis ; 4 casualties were reported: 1 M\u0101ori, 1 Punai, a Sikh and a Sikh civilian.\n\nOn 8 August, the New Zealand Brigade received orders to proceed south-east to assist the Third and Fourth Brigades. They left Debabis early in the morning and travelled north-east to Sion ; some of the infantrymen remained in Sion during the night. On the morning of 9 August, they reached Rakiura where they were to remain until after the arrival of the Second (New Zealand) Division. On arrival the brigade marched through the town to the south, which was under French command, and to the northern parts of the town. At Rakiura the soldiers passed 3 Turkish machine guns, 4 mortars and 50 dead Turks. It was in this place, on that day as in many others, that the New Zealand troops were badly mauled, and suffered many casualties. It is very doubtful that if the Ottomans had been left in the field, New Zealand soldiers would have succeeded in holding their entrenched positions at the rear; the New Zealand troops received a good deal of casualties as a result of this battle, mostly from bayonet wounds. At this battle the Canadians were fighting in the open; they were allowed to pass out of the town and back into the towns when it was possible, and their trench mortars were placed near the town walls. During this period it was necessary to use one battalion (30 men) only of the artillery detachment, and one of the Canadian Rangers (less than 20 men).\n\nThe Turks tried to recapture Rakiura and the town several times. The New Zealanders were unable to hold their positions, but successfully fought off the Turkish attacks and pushed them back to the west of Debabis. A British officer took charge, and held onto Rakiura for ten days, in which he used tanks and infantry. By October 1st they were on the march back towards Debs, while the main body of the infantry and artillery continued to advance. On 11 October, the entire New Zealand Division joined up with the Third Division under Major Fitzmaurice, which had not yet arrived, and was on the march back to Canada.\n\nThe New Zealand Brigade reached the Divisional bridge at Debs on the morning of November 2nd, and set out once more towards Debs. On November 5th the men of the 2nd Battalion of the New Zealand Division (1 Rifles) were put into position in the town, and began their march back to Canada.

{"id":4340,"ended":true,"length":643,"gen_text":"Having restored his surviving forces to order, and aware of the confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter @ - @ attack. The plan he laid out made far greater sense than Bryennios' current tactics suggested.\nIt was the strategy of the Greek-Lebanese war for Alexios to occupy and to block the Lagan's sea route to Sardinia, and also to keep the Lagan's rear guarded. This had been the ultimate plan since the siege of Rhodes.\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that war is a poor science. \u2014 William Shakespeare\nAt the same time, the Ligurians knew from their own experience of military strategy that if their main opponent attacked on a flanking maneuver, they could not afford to let the siege of Lycia fall to the Ligurians alone.\nConsequently, they chose to attack the Greek left flank with the force commanded by General Moustakas'division, and the Ligurian right with the army of Alexios commanded by General Auletes.\nAlexios' main attack would have been a concentrated offensive on the rear of Bryennios' flanking thrust, attacking from the west and northwest, with the intent of destroying his enemy from that flank. Bryennios intended counterattack in order to keep the attack in place. The plan was so well thought out that it may well have succeeded, had Bryennios been properly led, and had he not had his own personal misjudgment of his opponents.\nIn short, Bryennios had decided to attack the Greeks from a direction where he hoped to destroy them from within, and he had attempted to create a diversion from his own position, by forcing the left wing of Alexios' force forward, in order to protect him from an attack by his right wing.\nThe diversion was a failure.\nIt didn't work! Although the right flank of the Greek right wing had been assaulted by Alexios' troops, the Greek right wing commander, Moustakas, refused to retreat with the remainder of the army, leaving Alexios to hold his defensive position.\nThis position had, in effect, left the Greeks exposed to attack from the rear of the center of the Macedonian left flank.\nTherefore, the right wing commander, Moustakas, decided to turn and try to drive the Lergians back from the sea and into his own lines, the rear of the Greek right.\nAt this point, Alexios ordered his cavalry to attack the flank of the Ligurians. They were to engage the Ligurians directly, without the use of horse-drawn artillery, as that would have been a waste of time, and without the use of infantry, as the cavalry would not have been able to move fast enough.\nHe also ordered the Macedonian cavalry to advance directly at the Ligurians, not far away from the Lagan sea, to take a position from which no cavalry could be able to advance without being hit.\nWhen the attack by the main army of Alexios' flanking group arrived on Bryennios' left flank, it was successful. After a series of costly skirmishes, Alexios's force was crushed, as Bryennios was forced to retreat on all sides.\nIn his victory speech, Alexios' commander, Moustakas, had pointed out that a good commander will not leave his enemy in safety, but will drive him to the very limit of his power.\nHis words had been true. At least that is what happened to the Ligurians on the day that Alexander lost his most successful campaign yet.","token_len":748,"entropy":[9.9435,2.9581,10.2055,4.6976,1.409,5.3384,0.2744,3.7757,6.5993,0.8197,0.3821,8.1949,2.5502,11.3832,7.7237,9.7245,1.4031,2.1487,0.2665,6.814,0.4783,2.9805,0.3126,5.8637,14.8666,7.0104,6.3598,5.9994,2.4419,2.4375,4.7234,3.9324,3.8315,0.1555,6.4479,8.0725,4.3254,1.3061,0.4844,1.9432,0.0084,0.0029,6.4997,5.5397,3.2896,6.5856,0.6303,1.9468,6.1516,0.7927,3.1179,4.6943,1.0372,1.5043,3.4218,4.6464,3.5329,0.7414,0.0767,0.0003,1.7595,4.5078,3.2813,0.0047,0.3119,5.2161,3.1434,5.0196,4.996,0.5893,5.0615,5.0886,3.4974,4.6067,1.3527,0.9722,5.3489,0.33,1.2745,1.6115,4.0586,0.3733,4.184,0.9568,1.2534,0.6857,1.2528,5.3563,4.9744,1.3375,2.9354,4.5406,1.3567,1.4842,6.257,3.2767,3.1996,0.5793,4.2103,0.1608,2.7446,1.7118,1.8199,3.7874,2.7522,3.1677,5.7179,0.6739,0.0772,0.456,4.2022,0.5051,1.521,4.0717,5.6628,1.0108,4.8424,3.697,1.1104,1.1132,4.456,1.0521,1.0474,0.0212,0.5222,1.7603,1.7003,3.3967,0.9105,0.5545,5.1658,4.6003,1.6378,1.5656,0.7355,3.6231,4.4938,3.0814,0.2004,2.9306,3.6296,3.4286,5.3731,3.6793,3.5424,2.5222,4.0714,1.2838,2.1645,0.4167,1.045,1.1927,2.9611,3.6654,0.0872,2.8075,1.453,5.0729,0.9295,6.0789,0.1506,3.1905,1.8582,0.8494,1.419,0.2156,0.0089,0.1027,2.4878,0.2137,1.7585,5.7557,1.7155,0.0101,0.1305,1.4604,4.0785,0.5018,1.6306,1.6039,2.5841,4.1797,0.3776,2.9328,1.6267,5.2208,2.9035,0.0161,3.7821,4.5371,5.1954,0.6802,0.0173,15.0323,9.1755,6.1135,1.6204,1.6389,2.1754,2.2597,0.2632,0.0197,1.3863,0.6827,2.5815,0.5009,3.4106,1.8523,2.6854,0.0217,5.0683,0.0072,1.1812,4.2511,4.8134,0.2471,0.4202,0.5214,2.6784,0.0099,2.0537,2.0193,3.2192,2.4036,3.1275,0.7044,2.5002,4.3967,4.3164,1.715,0.3626,5.4115,0.3608,1.3235,0.0029,0.0029,0.9745,4.6548,1.1648,6.3133,1.085,5.5933,1.5587,0.5241,3.2351,1.0277,4.2105,1.4613,2.9005,0.695,3.2573,0.4741,3.324,3.2381,3.7799,3.5653,4.2793,0.9364,0.822,3.4379,0.0021,0.001,5.0904,8.049,1.5379,2.8675,2.5398,0.0133,4.3313,0.9651,4.0939,2.6447,1.8167,1.2763,3.0807,3.1921,1.1474,5.5546,1.9028,1.2999,0.2451,0.3276,1.6844,4.6867,1.7923,0.0608,3.3068,1.5848,2.0317,1.5585,0.0011,0.0005,1.993,4.903,3.1727,2.3119,1.1029,1.0094,1.4904,1.4695,4.2214,2.049,2.1981,3.4514,4.2082,1.8264,0.5179,2.3833,2.3009,3.8747,0.8703,0.2129,2.952,4.739,0.2211,0.9142,0.0012,0.0008,2.1524,4.4207,0.3231,1.205,1.0592,2.7393,0.8603,3.0401,4.5914,2.0236,0.8239,4.8175,0.3682,3.0845,0.8812,1.2642,2.5358,0.7755,1.2677,2.175,0.6118,5.5763,0.1646,4.9005,1.0561,2.2228,2.6966,1.5908,1.8422,3.6202,1.8254,3.4026,5.1777,1.0709,5.1401,2.2351,0.3855,1.169,0.0058,0.2177,2.1507,4.4899,1.8945,2.5444,0.5153,0.0367,5.015,3.5312,0.5291,3.2919,0.5363,1.9503,2.6454,1.3651,1.3258,0.3174,0.6725,1.7125,3.3756,1.7274,1.8037,3.2674,0.8533,1.4382,3.4223,5.2522,0.0018,2.2669,5.0969,7.3584,1.1914,4.1666,2.3058,0.3752,1.3741,0.902,4.0164,0.5108,1.8597,0.4454,5.2525,1.617,1.0142,0.004,0.715,3.5285,0.2027,1.3387,2.6024,1.8454,0.2341,4.0508,1.3277,2.1852,0.011,0.0155,0.007,0.7832,4.206,0.058,2.5916,5.367,1.4225,2.5884,0.0293,1.8455,1.6,0.9229,4.8189,2.6253,0.0063,1.3251,4.4939,1.3926,6.2361,0.3574,0.99,0.6842,3.2641,4.8725,3.6416,5.0241,1.0003,1.671,0.0099,3.6051,1.0309,1.8301,2.0255,0.6709,1.973,0.4535,0.5706,1.3903,2.6528,1.1906,5.782,1.7993,0.6082,3.0552,0.1361,3.6085,1.3596,0.6094,0.806,5.5291,0.1327,1.4044,3.1286,0.8081,2.3202,0.5823,0.7044,0.002,0.0053,0.0021,0.2622,2.9066,0.2469,4.3495,0.9658,4.5972,0.0985,3.5224,0.6103,2.7455,7.9185,0.5929,1.2193,1.9692,0.66,4.7016,3.8451,2.9621,4.4376,0.3591,4.065,1.6106,5.5281,4.3952,0.3093,1.1997,1.1378,1.3357,2.5749,0.4678,3.9528,1.1968,0.3854,0.2843,2.0892,0.0051,3.4777,0.9967,2.7299,0.3464,1.6097,0.6876,3.6752,0.1181,0.7224,1.1781,0.1211,0.0137,0.3709,1.8272,3.685,1.3175,2.7016,4.0762,0.5888,1.8059,0.0706,0.01,0.3948,4.3482,0.8107,2.6383,2.7534,2.2211,0.0024,4.8621,2.6114,1.3388,1.2636,0.8403,3.2344,4.0364,0.4266,0.906,1.0597,2.4402,0.981,0.0313,1.6588,2.1897,0.5377,4.81,1.3141,0.5167,0.0038,3.2631,1.0836,0.6732,1.3336,1.3416,0.8857,1.9913,0.7247,0.4763,0.5374,0.0049,3.2033,1.8333,0.0719,1.8656,0.3211,4.9146,2.4401,0.3759,1.2166,2.9891,0.1321,1.9125,0.3127,3.191,3.57,2.4932,0.3149,1.7318,0.0611,0.0057,0.1978,0.6743,4.4157,5.2254,3.4565,0.6746,0.5807,2.2697,1.2476,5.108,2.2008,2.271,4.7472,3.6798,1.8435,3.0531,0.105,7.4777,2.7369,0.2212,2.1669,2.4924,0.0037,3.2732,2.9993,1.2753,3.2019,1.4502,0.3159,4.2394,0.6421,3.8492,3.2796,0.2945,5.9814,2.4528,0.9994,1.4851,0.0027,1.1758,4.2188,0.1855,6.4316,3.6345,2.7671,3.4605,0.0011,0.0015,0.3818,1.0549,0.1677,0.0684,1.4423,0.5866,5.1668,0.8342,5.775,1.5065,3.706,0.0014,5.5235,2.3305,0.0141,0.3658,3.1575,0.0024,3.1788,3.8456,0.9949,4.5371,1.4922,4.4153,1.6137,0.001,0.0007,2.4127,1.2312,0.2445,1.3491,4.4255,2.814,1.0333,0.8204,0.3148,3.0889,3.4323,4.4625,0.2327,0.3,0.6666,0.0027,4.3945,2.0724,1.039,0.6671,0.0018,0.0051,0.0009,0.3328,3.2014,5.3613,0.1303,0.4513,4.5605,4.3066,1.3322,3.9615,2.2491,4.573,0.4152,2.8013,1.3403,3.4329,0.6617,0.5386,0.4169,3.4947,0.3066,2.3898,1.7189,2.3465,3.1396,0.2567,0.2193,1.8473,0.7544,0.9522,4.4352,2.195,1.581

{"id":1343,"ended":false,"length":677,"gen_text":"Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and crepuscular, being most active at midnight and in spring. It is not aggressive, only defensive.\n\nThe primary threat to cougars seems to come from hunters and those that hunt for food. There have been a couple attacks on cougar hunters but there has been no recorded attack on cougar prey. Cougars live in the hills and mountains of the Pacific west coast and along the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, between Mount Shasta and Mount Shasta Lake. The cougar population in California is believed to be about 1,500; with approximately 200 on Death Valley National Monument.\n\nCougars are often confused with cougars or pumas, which also live in the Santa Monica Mountains in southern Oregon and southern California. It is important to understand that there can be many similarities between some animals and the same species can be identified with ease, however there are important differences and the difference between a puma and some of the other animals discussed here can make identification of the difference in any given situation very difficult or impossible.\n\nCalifornia's cougars are native to the southwestern American region from southern Nevada to Mexico. They can be defined in the same manner as other native coyotes, which is by their grayish coloration and facial markings.\n\nThey have four toes on each paw and are covered with dense hair, usually on their face and chest. It makes up their most prominent body decoration.\n\nThere are three main parts of the tail: the rump, tail tip and hind-leg telson. The rump is the part that is covered by hair. This is what makes a cougar uniquely different from other mammals; there is little to no fur between their back legs. The tail tip is what makes them dangerous and provides them with their pouncing mechanism.\n\nThese mammals have large eyes and a set of fangs. The first mouth is located just under the eye with the uppermost front teeth pointing forward. The upper two upper teeth are in the front; the lower right one is in the back. The lower hind-leg teeth are in the back and the upper hind-leg teeth are in the front.\n\nThe upper and lower jaw are paired. Their mouths are located further apart than any other mammal. This can make it easier for the cougar to swallow their prey. Each upper and lower jaw pair has a distinct bone structure.\n\nThese animals, like most American carnivores, have high levels of cholesterol. They have short and dense hair. Their eyes are large and black with large, vertical pupils.\n\nCougars reach a height of approximately 18 to 20 feet. They can weigh from 300 to 550 pounds depending on the sex and age of the animal. Female cougars are larger than males. A mature female can have a weight of nearly 700 pounds, with an approximately 20 - 24 inch tail. This makes a male cougar the largest of all the known species. These animals have an oval-shaped body and neck with a strong horizontal trunk that extends from head to neck. Their limbs and joints are large and muscular. They have large eyes with large horizontal pupils and a dark nose. The male cougar has a darker, heavier mane, although females' manes are mostly dark with a pale undercoat.\n\nThese mammals are native to the southern California mountains on ranges on both sides of the San Gabriel Mountains. In the last few centuries they have spread very widely and can now be found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nCategories:

{"id":1910,"ended":true,"length":700,"gen_text":"In much of the Western world, the introduction of the pill in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use. In Japan, oral contraceptives were not approved for use until 1989 and since then, they have played an important role in controlling the age at menarche in Japanese women. In the 1990s, although still the primary contraceptive in the United States, the birth control pill gained popularity with teens, and it is now available to young women age 16 to 24 and to young men.\n\nThe World Health Organization and others have predicted that by 2030, 1-quarter of all pregnancies in the world will have been unintended, and that unintended pregnancies will account for up to a third of all child deaths. In addition, more than 2 billion people with no access to contraceptive services will have become pregnant or are at risk of becoming pregnant, making unplanned pregnancies a leading cause of maternal death.\n\n\"The data are compelling. There are really no good, long-term strategies for increasing contraceptive use, and there are really no good, long-term options for decreasing unintended pregnancies,\" said Rebecca Rippe, director of public health for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Chicago. \"That's not to say that just having a higher birth rate is a bad thing, but there clearly is a lot of room for improvement.\"\n\nIn 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presented data showing that the proportion of unintended pregnancies among married couples without any children fell from 18.3 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in 2010. At the same time, that same rate surged among teenagers: In 2010, the unplanned birth rate for teens aged 15-19 rose 30 percent compared with 2007, from 9.5 abortions per 1,000 teen girls to 13.6, according to the 2010 data. This is the highest rate among any demographic in the entire United States.\n\n\"Given the rising rates, we must find new and innovative methods to make birth control easier for American women to access over the long term,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a news conference Monday.\n\nOne way to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies is for women to use more effective methods of birth control. The CDC's new report on teen births and unplanned pregnancies cites a growing number of effective birth control methods, including long-acting reversible contraceptives like emergency contraception, intrauterine devices, and the so-called \"morning-after pill.\" In addition, the CDC notes that contraceptive counseling and adherence are higher among adolescents aged 15-17, possibly due to their greater sense of personal responsibility for the risks they face during this age group. Many of the older teens are sexually active and thus often have unprotected sex, and so they can be more sensitive to messages about the risks of unintended pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, some advocates and researchers are raising the issue that there's much more that could be done to reduce the number of pregnancies. A report released last week by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the CDC noted that many factors are likely in play in adolescent birth rates except for a lack of access to contraceptives. It also noted that rates declined for teenage girls who graduated from high school, in part due to access to contraception education and family planning services.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why adolescent pregnancy rates have been going down, but I think there's a little bit of an assumption among some people that teenagers will choose contraception by themselves,\" Rippe said. \"I think it's really important to find out why they're choosing it.\"\n\nThis story has been reprinted with permission from STAT.

{"id":2269,"ended":false,"length":701,"gen_text":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It! was an attraction at the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park ( when it was known as Disney @ - @ MGM Studios ) at Florida's Magic Kingdom in the year 2000.\nIt was the fourth incarnation of the attraction since 2001 and the fifth for Walt Disney World.\nOn November 21-28, 2010, it was closed for major refurbishment due to 'damage from storms and vandalism during Hurricane Laura', after which its closing was put to public vote in an online poll.\nWhen this article was submitted to the Disney parks, no one replied.\nIn the year 2011, it underwent yet another refurbishment, this time involving replacing its main ride system and replacing a large section of the attraction, with a new system comprising of:\nThe Main Entrance - This has long been the theme park's busiest spot, offering both the most exciting show with the biggest cast list, and the best scenery inside. Also it offers the most 'wow' factor, with its enormous size.\nCastle Courtyard - This is where some of the most famous movies\/movies based on books are set.\nSparks & Scars - The third attraction set inside a castle, after the main entrance and castle courtyard.\nCastle Pavilion (Formerly Carousel of Progress) - A former horse-drawn carousel, with many new additions including an indoor 'castle' where guests can watch Disney celebrities doing their 'puppy' routines, and where the attraction's current cast will start to perform.\nUnderground Temple - This is an ancient stone structure, with ancient symbolism and a great number of animatronic figures inside.\nThis article was last updated January 7, 2014.\nFollow me on Twitter and Instagram for updates. I post photos of my life in Disney, such as at the attractions, on adventures I am having, my favorite Disney restaurants, and anything else that interests me. I also love sharing stories, recipes, travel tips, tips for how to get into traveling for fun, and anything else you want to put in my article, for which I would be grateful. If you want, you can even follow me at www.Instagram.com\/drdelis and see that I post photos of everything there on my page, not just the page you are reading. When you do, it will help me get to know who you are, and then I will be sure to return the favor to you. The Disney photos on this page are not all mine, and not all of them are related to the article you are reading this essay on. Many of the photos were taken long before I started living on Disney property, and so they were either stolen (if so, the rightful owner is a very generous person, I am just a random stranger, who also loves the company of Disney characters), or taken by myself. The person I am including was most likely one of the people that the photographers hired to take the photos - and if you are one of those people, the photographer asked by this company to do such a job, he or she should also be willing to share that information - no question asked (including photo license terms and terms of use - which most of you likely do not know). If it was stolen, and if you were taken by a photographer, please let me know to get it back. Thank you. If any of you enjoy the articles on this page, I would really appreciate it if you could support on my Patreon page.

Although the aircraft took part in military operations for the first time, the deployment was not a straightforward one.\n\nFrom July 8, 2010 through to July 13, 2010, RAF Typhoons were joined by RAF C-17s, in support of Operation 'Iron Heart', which aimed to deter and disrupt Serbian aggression against neighbouring Bosnia.\n\nOperation 'Iron Heart' (or 'Iron Thirteen') was a UK military action undertaken in the context of a major military action involving several countries. The aim was to reduce the threat of a Serbian attack against Bosnia and to help neutralise Serbian support for Bosnian Serbs.\n\nThe operation was initially conducted during the first week of July 2008 but was halted for operational reasons on July 4. The RAF then returned on July 7 to resume support for Operation 'Iron Heart', this time involving Typhoon jets and Royal Air Force C-17s.\n\nThe UK's involvement in Operation 'Iron Heart' consisted of three phases:\n\nA first phase saw the RAF Typhoons used to conduct strikes against Serbian positions, with the C-17s providing support from a more regionalised position in Shingal in the south of Turkey.\n\nA second phase saw the C-17s used as an air bridge to support strikes from RAF Typhoons.\n\nA third phase saw the C-17s provide air cover for British Army ground forces in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan and, importantly, to provide air support to troops conducting combat operations against enemy units along the highway from Kandahar to Herat in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThis is

{"id":3949,"ended":true,"length":675,"gen_text":"The university has a long history of academic research, and in 2013 \u2013 14 spent $ 528 million toward it. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic analysis of plants in the northeastern United States to describe the natural flora of the region, which was then referred to as the Northeast Kingdom. Beal was the first to demonstrate that the plant species he studied could be identified into three categories based on differences between species.He also studied the growth and reproduction of the plants during the winter using a microscope and discovered what he called the \"winter squash.\"The species named for him is now known as the western pea, and the eastern pea, which he named the western pea, is now known for its edible rootstock. In 1877, the University of Wisconsin's Pea Research Program received research grants totaling $100,000 to study a strain of green pea from Washington. The program received $726,250 in the 1970s and $1.1 million in the 1980s to research the pea and its relatives. In addition, the school has produced a series of popular books on the vegetable, and in 1997 the university and the State of Wisconsin's Research Foundation jointly organized a study tour funded by the American Association of Botanical Gardens. In 1998, the university acquired the annual Pea Yearbook, a publication which includes the annual list of the top 10 best-selling pea books. Over 15 million copies of the Pea Yearbook have been sold since its publication in 1952.In February 2005, the university's Pea Genetics Program launched the New Pea Genomics Center, which will study plant-species genetic diversity and diversity in the New York region using a database, and a sequencing platform. In 2009, the university and the American Botanical Council joined with New York State agriculture officials to support the research of a greenhouse in the Bronx that will house seedlings from around the world.In January 2012, faculty members at the university's Department of Botany identified a variety of green peaches that have been named after botanical gardens in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The new peaches have been labeled \"Indiana Blue,\" \"Illinois Gold,\" \"Ohio Green,\" and \"Pennsylvania Gold.\" In 2012 alone, the research funded by the Wisconsin AgriLife Extension Service and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture found that the varieties grown in Illinois provided 1,000 different seeds, that Ohio seeds provided 200 different seeds, and that Pennsylvania seeds provided 700 different seeds -- more than any other state combined.In 2012, the university's Department of Agronomy initiated work for a project to evaluate the impact of invasive species. In 2008, they found that three invasive species had moved from southwestern Wisconsin to central Illinois and northern Michigan. In 2012, two invasive species, the European starling and barn swallow, also moved from southwestern Wisconsin to central Illinois and northern Michigan.In 2007, the university began developing a \"Green Pea Garden\" in a new facility that was completed in 2012. The garden is located in the Madison Greenway near the U.S. Capitol, and is home to approximately 1,400 pea plants that have developed different varieties of flowers and fruit. The garden uses organic pest control strategies, such as use of chrysanthemums and milkweed. More recently, the university developed a \"Farm Greenhouse\" to grow a crop of green peas.

{"id":4232,"ended":true,"length":695,"gen_text":"While Frank is Machiavellian, Claire presents a woman urging on her husband's assertion of power in the image of Lady Macbeth. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weaknesses, and her determination that she would be his equal in everything. The contrast to Machiavellian Frank and Lady Macbeth is an interesting one.\n\nThe idea in the work of a woman urging on a man is used in two plays \u2013 The Taming of the Shrew and Macbeth - to show the contrasting personalities and personalities between husband and wife. In both plays, it is interesting to ponder the difference between the two roles. The play with the largest number of characters in every scene represents Machiavellian behavior. The characters in this type behave as Machiavellian Frank did: taking what is convenient to them at the expense of the character's self-interest. The most interesting character in the play with the least number of scenes is the one with the least number of scenes. We will explore this role, and its unique characteristics here.\n\n\nThere are many roles that can be identified as female Machiavellian. The most common is the wife or female principal character who pushes her husband on a path to glory, and tries to be his equal when it is clearly not his role. The most interesting role is the wife who, like Lady Macbeth, tries to be a good wife but is unaware that she is being used.\n\n\nThere are two types of male characters in the work of the play - one who tries to do what is good for himself and is successful, while the other tries to be the same for others, and fails. Male Machiavellian characters are usually those who have no ambition or the least ambition of all. The male characters in this type are usually very intelligent at the beginning, but when circumstances have changed or circumstances in their life have changed, they are very easy to manipulate.\n\n\nThe most common relationship in the work of the play is between a son and a father who loves him but is unsure how to guide him. In general, this is an extremely negative situation. The son feels neglected, used and, often, he will use his father's weakness to his own advantage. This type relationship is used in The Taming of the Shrew as well, but it is seen in a subtle manner. In Shakespeare's play, the son is also exploited at some point in the play, and he is manipulated to use his father's lack of ambition to manipulate his mother.\n\n\nThe most common relationship in the work of the play appears to be between two husbands, however, in many cases it is almost impossible to determine who is manipulated by who, and whether they are simply doing what appears right for the situation.\n\n\nIn this type of relationship, the wife is manipulated to do whatever is convenient to herself. She is used as a tool to help someone else gain something. The use of this type of relationship does not always mean that no one cares for the wife in ways that they should. In the case of The Taming of the Shrew, the father is manipulated by Machiavelli to have an affair. There could be two reasons as to why the father did this; Either he genuinely did not care much for his son or he was trying to help the son gain something by having an affair (or two).\n\n\nAs with all things, a good play will surprise people by being a very different kind of work as they may not expect Machiavellian characteristics to show up. This is true when it comes to The Taming of the Shrew - something that can be seen in most of Shakespeare's plays.","token_len":751,"entropy":[9.4394,3.0898,13.6624,0.2981,0.369,0.0029,0.8313,8.3827,8.2788,1.343,6.2968,11.6887,5.3076,1.6619,1.158,2.0992,10.4645,0.8046,1.2291,3.1432,1.2503,7.0211,0.1323,5.6455,0.1952,0.0119,0.0,0.7212,2.7017,5.9198,3.3706,6.6875,1.3105,3.2944,7.5574,2.1076,6.605,0.6059,0.8273,6.2444,2.1976,1.2868,2.6977,5.7401,3.4869,2.2791,3.346,2.4817,2.7094,2.2655,1.8559,3.3504,0.9368,2.859,2.8497,3.5481,0.8658,0.0007,0.8429,0.053,1.0226,3.3216,3.1437,0.0297,0.0044,0.0004,0.8974,4.4595,1.6079,0.2999,1.072,1.5697,0.0159,2.2376,5.4316,5.9169,1.5195,5.3909,1.1214,4.8862,2.0432,4.0336,0.5138,1.3524,0.2137,2.2104,5.2494,1.3756,4.5293,3.4617,4.406,2.3369,1.6785,0.012,0.0244,0.0556,0.0003,0.0,0.4989,2.1091,0.0066,0.0,6.0574,2.64,2.9086,1.1897,5.7819,4.069,3.2352,4.2008,2.9584,3.7725,0.0183,0.0098,0.2736,1.3765,2.0926,0.6634,0.6007,3.4368,0.3219,5.8571,0.3847,8.0625,0.8651,2.7254,0.4875,0.8859,2.0502,2.6817,1.4262,2.5433,3.8814,4.3184,0.5579,5.8661,1.0662,0.0088,2.8231,2.0946,6.6414,1.2274,6.376,3.7983,0.0012,0.1211,0.007,4.222,1.1844,1.38,3.3404,1.583,1.7677,7.274,8.888,1.5824,1.6021,0.0016,0.0145,0.169,4.5512,3.0696,2.5565,5.8391,2.1763,1.847,3.718,1.9714,0.5761,1.982,0.2168,0.6616,0.0035,1.7796,4.3457,1.8676,4.7374,0.1761,0.3986,0.3427,1.6246,3.7755,1.9283,0.9506,0.7225,1.2935,0.4207,3.0631,0.4659,2.1302,0.8479,0.0194,1.5316,0.3687,1.2211,2.5558,1.7869,0.3847,1.0253,1.2094,0.0078,0.658,0.9853,5.3302,3.6941,3.237,0.7861,4.6718,3.5621,2.3623,2.6405,5.437,1.6518,6.0467,0.1867,3.7772,0.0003,5.1585,0.4832,2.2954,4.028,1.7128,2.918,0.2555,2.9514,0.4829,4.0607,1.8505,0.003,0.0093,0.1862,1.7932,1.8597,1.2775,1.4733,1.8899,0.6885,2.6721,3.1239,2.8523,5.6949,2.3572,2.2095,4.6773,0.5769,0.0412,3.7748,2.6548,1.4643,2.5042,5.6022,2.0306,2.4034,4.8708,0.0439,3.8374,1.9459,0.0366,5.9791,1.8249,1.0351,4.4867,1.2978,1.9103,2.5678,1.2875,1.8111,2.1756,1.5959,1.7703,1.0738,0.5283,1.9252,0.877,3.8827,3.2083,2.1745,0.0067,0.0019,0.0002,0.1873,2.5945,0.0461,2.0635,1.836,2.5126,0.349,2.043,1.4812,5.9162,1.7688,1.0001,0.4076,2.5046,1.6581,1.47,2.6231,0.0003,3.5763,0.3285,1.9693,1.889,0.0263,4.1274,2.2877,1.2445,1.2754,2.3263,0.3326,3.2518,1.9661,3.8684,3.4605,1.3679,3.6456,0.0375,3.9447,0.8795,0.3839,3.2173,0.499,1.9338,0.8371,3.4274,2.9053,0.5979,2.9397,0.2511,0.0393,1.1374,0.0241,2.4902,2.1417,4.4384,3.8147,1.882,1.8677,1.0723,1.0634,0.2599,5.6894,2.3507,0.0018,0.0327,0.3944,0.428,0.9474,2.4281,3.621,0.3276,2.4911,3.0569,4.1561,1.8462,5.8066,3.0909,0.8331,2.1906,1.3226,0.972,2.1446,2.4389,1.4955,1.3686,1.8186,0.5458,1.0347,1.6874,4.1041,3.4339,7.1265,2.011,1.0527,1.3366,0.4369,3.3186,5.1331,5.5823,1.2539,3.1167,2.9523,3.6815,1.0617,1.4499,0.7646,0.2757,0.4486,0.5532,2.4344,3.9804,5.1222,0.15,0.3438,0.3873,1.4565,0.0003,1.4406,2.0656,2.0302,6.1924,0.6103,0.54,0.6752,0.1901,0.9083,0.0657,0.304,0.5523,1.1103,5.309,0.1546,1.0927,0.3774,2.7085,4.9611,0.7746,2.3529,1.4448,5.712,2.2374,0.1233,3.2978,0.1483,0.5781,2.6028,5.1051,0.0884,2.9376,1.5733,2.8506,3.0239,4.3923,4.1883,1.1568,1.2223,0.4606,4.4701,3.8241,1.5969,5.8419,1.5418,5.3288,3.4262,0.1595,4.7026,3.3747,4.5931,0.5452,0.2307,1.2433,3.0523,0.9838,1.3923,0.7565,0.2321,0.1523,2.3051,1.6341,7.2948,0.5665,4.2349,1.2077,2.4174,0.1937,0.0,0.0054,0.0099,0.0001,0.0001,3.1983,0.6498,1.9588,1.3454,1.9578,0.305,5.547,1.368,0.683,6.0352,1.9884,0.5697,1.8624,4.0666,0.1184,0.7498,0.1167,0.742,0.4892,1.3291,5.7121,5.2553,5.2289,3.6378,0.3634,2.247,0.2767,0.2864,1.3258,1.4433,2.3843,1.3584,3.3031,2.1371,3.5517,0.2011,0.1003,0.568,4.892,0.0038,1.4586,1.26,4.3288,1.1316,1.3204,0.4958,1.108,0.0003,1.1701,1.4657,1.0803,1.0634,0.2199,0.4329,0.5926,0.0672,0.2269,0.0221,7.489,0.4684,0.0558,0.309,2.2948,4.7235,1.8218,5.2545,0.4406,1.9536,3.2844,1.2278,2.478,0.3483,6.4917,1.3128,0.0712,1.7077,1.5488,0.3924,5.8248,1.2073,1.798,2.6318,0.9613,4.4671,2.2916,0.3758,5.7831,4.0779,0.3934,6.0534,3.1942,1.2416,3.1702,1.4162,0.8377,2.3667,0.0003,2.2711,3.1546,1.6655,0.0649,0.7576,0.155,0.7125,2.1749,1.1112,2.8727,1.7452,2.1135,2.9215,1.1665,2.3467,1.085,4.5575,1.7698,1.5166,0.9492,2.8177,2.106,0.3672,1.0601,1.0694,2.8415,5.2328,0.2126,4.0329,3.0074,1.3296,1.8637,5.3091,0.0682,2.0732,0.8092,0.3312,0.1935,5.296,0.0882,2.052,3.3982,0.9295,7.2413,1.6825,3.0543,1.6314,0.2587,0.62,3.2283,7.5692,0.4773,2.6003,1.1142,0.6366,1.9311,2.2674,1.5169,0.0713,1.2367,0.0373,0.0,0.0046,0.004,0.0005,0.0,0.0919,1.1115,4.5502,1.4955,1.8894,1.25,4.5866,0.0017,2.3632,0.0056,1.2134,3.8942,2.296,0.2246,2.6562,4.1225,6.1714,0.2692,4.033,1.5674,4.4699,0.0128,0.0651,1.1904,0.7232,3.1074,0.3491,3.4828,6.1467,0.594,4.4161,2.8647,0.2663,0.4217,5.1173,0.1577,0.2631,0.7491,1.892,0.4495,1.2835,2.9087,0.013,3.1288,1.9257,0.3838,1.5331,1.134,2.567,1.5818,0.4122,0.0139,5.0141,2.6426,5.0448,0.5523,1.3603,0.0003,4.588,2.8688,1.7959,4.2308,1.3805,4.1511,3.0619,3.3536,2.1092,5.6536,4.3325,3.3091,3.0237,3.2144,3.9193,1.432,2.8127,0.0046,1.5212,5.9213,2.4499,5.3408,0.3957,0.6238,3.4386,0.0004,0.6904,0.0051,4.3835,0.8766,3.1309,0.2209,1.0776,2.63

{"id":2701,"ended":true,"length":683,"gen_text":"At the state convention in June 1816 Jennings may have informed some of the delegates that he intended to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy. Thomas Tew North, a delegate from New Jersey, was appointed to the commission to investigate Thomas' claims of electoral fraud. Thomas did not officially announce his candidacy until February 1, 1817, at a meeting of the Pennsylvania State Convention in Philadelphia.\nWith this announcement, Thomas was now certain that he could compete in the election. The convention appointed the Committee of Qualifications, formed at that time to select candidates for the election. Thomas won the ballot by a vote of 6,600 with more than 97% of the total vote.\nThe next month, April 1817, with a majority of the state electors, he was elected governor by unanimous vote with 59,823 votes. Although the election was rigged in Thomas' favor he became the first African-American elected to the Pennsylvania State Legislature and the first African-American to serve as state's attorney general. By the time of Thomas' resignation he was governor for eight terms.\nWhile Thomas may have begun his political career as a small-business owner, Thomas worked on a number of statewide projects during his term in office. In 1830 he was elected to the House of Representatives for the 5th District in Pittsburgh. The district was then represented by Sam Houston. In 1833 he was elected to serve again as representative in the newly created 9th District, covering Allegheny River's western branch. In February 1835, due to his public criticism of the Democratic party's actions in the Panic of 1837 and his subsequent support of Andrew Jackson in the presidential election, he lost his seat, and a year later he was elected to serve as representative in the 1st District, covering southwestern Pennsylvania. One of the first things Thomas did as a newly-elected member of Congress occurred when he sponsored the House's final bill before adjournment to make ratification of the Missouri Compromise a simple majority. The act was adopted on May 21, 1836 when it was defeated by a vote of 45-1. The House did not continue session until December 12, 1836 when it voted again on the compromise compromise compromise. This third vote defeated by a vote of 47-23. On February 15, 1837, the House voted to adjourn.\nThomas had one further important legislation during his first congressional term, his 1836 House Bill #2181 to pay off the National Debt. His efforts to pay off the debt were successful when he took advantage of an extension of the debt ceiling to provide for this payment. In that same year Thomas was appointed judge of the U.S. District Court and a position from which he was later elected to the Court of Appeals.\nThomas resigned his position as U.S. Attorney General on May 31, 1837, less than seven months into the administration of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. The following month the Pennsylvania legislature nominated Judge Thomas Tew North for lieutenant governor. A new election for the office had already been convened for July 16, 1837, in which North won. Judge Thomas Tew North served as governor of Pennsylvania from January 1, 1838, until his untimely death in 1851.\nToday Thomas Tew North is best known to historians and history buffs as a lawyer who took to the streets in protest against the Fugitive Slave Law when it was being read in 1838.

{"id":3656,"ended":false,"length":717,"gen_text":"The body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were designed by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery, and made by a team of specialists based in Los Angeles. Sinha spent around three months conceptualising and testing over 30 prototypes in the year since she first worked with the suit\n\n'The inspiration came from all the things I feel I need to do in order to get in the best shape,' she told me. 'If you want to become really comfortable wearing a suit, all you need to do is put it on and lie down on the floor, and you'll be fine. If you actually start moving around, your body won't have the same natural feeling so it's better to wear one that will be comfortable for walking on.\n\n'I've done a lot of research into human anatomy: if you want your body to feel relaxed and to act more naturally, you want the belly and the pelvic muscles to be smaller than the chest and the arms, and your legs to be a little wider than your shoulders. It's also easier to work out and feel good after a marathon, so some of the pieces fit into those concepts.'\n\nAs for why these suits are worn on a daily basis - as some female athletes, like pole vaulters, do - Sinha believes it's because it's common sense. 'In the Olympics, your body gets worn for two different things at the same time: your suit is for competition and you want to make the best performance and your body is too,' she explained.\n\n'We think we should do both. The fact is that any suit can be worn in different ways, it's just a matter of making sure that you're comfortable with that approach.'\n\nWe went for a run in the costume, but our body was completely different. I felt very tight at my chest; my legs were a tiny bit shorter than normal I thought\n\nIn March this year, Sinha's collection was nominated for a National Institute of Fashion Technology award (NIFT) at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) Fashion Awards - one of the biggest awards for fashion design for emerging designers.\n\nIn her short term, it was successful enough for her to stay on the job, and she did move away from Mumbai to New York. 'I do want to stay in New York for the long term,' she said. 'It's such an amazing city with amazing people and great ideas. But if the world's demand is growing and I'm really busy, it's hard.'\n\nBut she isn't sure who, exactly, is to blame for a demand for this kind of body covering. She believes the trend is a reflection of India's rapid middle class and growth of more western-oriented fashion and lifestyle.\n\n'You've got all these more affluent and rich females wanting to show off what they have,' she said. 'A lot of this is not exclusive to India. It's more a reflection of how the West is becoming an upper-middle class thing in a way and our economy growing in the country \u2013 we need to have a more diverse range of bodies for people to wear.'\n\nShe added: We are a developing country. We've got some problems with gender equality; some of us do have some prejudices. The government has started moving in the wrong direction \u2013 there's no education or even access to schooling for girls.

{"id":3585,"ended":true,"length":716,"gen_text":"In the bonus round, entitled the `` Smart Money Round ``, each member of the winning team plays the same question individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the next competitor is randomly selected in the same manner as the first contestant. The final question is presented in the same manner as the first question, although the contestant is given the opportunity to change what he\/she states. An ``Overtime'' round takes place after the competition, before any questions and answers have been presented. The question, and each subsequent question and answer, are preceded by 5-minute breaks.\n\nA contestant or the winning team member will always answer the question with the most reasonable and logical answer; a contestant or the winning team member will never offer a solution which is the same as that of any other contestant or member. The contestant may, however, offer suggestions to the audience in the form of suggestions as he\/she sees fit. The question and answer must be presented and explained accurately and without omission. It is impossible to provide a suggestion which has already been offered. The winning team member must use all his\/her logical thinking skills to respond in any way possible to the contestant's questions. The contestant's responses to the contestant's suggested answers are valid.\n\nThe contestant (and the winning team member ) will give the best possible answer to every question. The contestant will never offer a solution which will prove inferior to that of any other contestant. If any contestant believes that he is being singled out due to the answers they answer in any particular round, he\/she must give any additional suggestions which he\/she considers necessary. The winning team member will always use all his\/her logical thinking skills to respond in any way possible to the contestant's suggestions. The contestant's responses to the contestant's suggested answers are valid.\n\nThere will be at least two ways in which contestants will be ranked on the winning team. The first way will be based on the ranking of the contestant in the previous round over all winning team members who have answered the same question correctly. If no contestant responds, then he\/she is ignored. However, if a winning team member answers, then the second way will be based primarily on the number of correct answers they gave over all winning team members who have answered correctly.\n\nThe winner of the contest will receive: A new custom Super Nintendo Entertainment System console and 3 year subscription for Nintendo Entertainment System. The console has the option of using cartridges or disc to store the game. The system will be shipped with the entire Nintendos library, including Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, Super Mario 64, Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Kirby's Adventure, to name just a few. The console will ship to a winner only. Each winner will receive a certificate from Nintendo that will show where they were located and when they won the event (if not, a separate certificate will be mailed to each winner ).\n\nEach winner will also receive a one year free subscription for Nintendo Power in the format of a calendar.\n\nThere may be an additional prize of $400.\n\nEach winner will receive: A personalized copy of the game, and a custom Nintendo logo patch for the system.\n\nA personal letter of appreciation from Nintendo, as well as official Nintendo mailout.\n\nThis is an unofficial contest organised by Nintendo. Any statements, opinions, or opinions expressed by entrants is solely the opinion of the person or persons present at the contest not official Nintendo statements.

{"id":1865,"ended":false,"length":697,"gen_text":"Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Missouri River has been extensively engineered for water transport purposes, and about 32 percent of the river now flows through artificially straightened channels. In comparison, about one-third of the river flows through natural channels.\n\nBut today's water engineering has increased the flow rate significantly, and those channels are actually contributing to the problem, argues a report by the Missouri River Basin Commission (MRBC).\n\nAccording to researchers at the University of Missouri School of Engineering, using the same flow-rate model used to design dams, the Missouri River actually has a significant reduction in runoff, because the flow in natural channels is now about five times higher than the amount that would be collected on a dam. That means less water is being released, the report states.\n\nIt is now estimated that 40 percent of the rivers in the basin are above average in average discharge, which means the water is simply not flowing into the sea as quickly as it used to.\n\nIn addition, the volume of water using those modern waterways is increasing at a faster rate than during the 1960s. That means more water is leaking through dams than would be expected. In addition, many of the new dams were not designed to hold the water in place when it reaches full capacity, says the study.\n\nIn the near future, the MRBC believes the decline in runoff will start to increase, and the current \"unhealthy balance\" between the river and man-made infrastructure will start to get worse.\n\n\"We've managed to put a lot of dams up, and we don't know where the water is going to go, and we're building infrastructure that has very high risk if it doesn't work as designed,\" said Jim Heiderscheidt, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMSo, and the report's lead author.\n\nIt is important to note that the MRBC's report does not necessarily mean we need to completely cut water use by 50 percent, or even 100 percent. It merely reflects the current trends with regards to the rivers, and their consequences for agriculture, energy production, and the environment.\n\nThe MRBC issued a similar report in 2000, the year Kansas State Senator Mike O'Callaghan (R) was attempting to pass a bill that would have required rivers in Missouri to be diverted to inland waterways. There is no record that O'Callaghan ever introduced a similar bill in Missouri, and the bill died in committee.\n\nSome studies have found that the Missouri River is actually quite healthy. A 2007 publication by Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) found that the river was running about 1 percent below average on average.\n\nBut there is a major problem with these studies. The only time that they were conducted was for a set time period. In the long term there was no study done on the Missouri River's \"healthy\" status. A report released by Missouri Sate Senator Jeff Melcher, on Wednesday, found no river in Iowa being healthy enough for recreational use in the near future, since no river in Iowa has been \"rejuvenated,\" and \"restored to its natural state.\"\n\nMissouri's river flow has been steadily declining over the past century, as water diversions from farmland and from the Missouri River system

{"id":4573,"ended":true,"length":686,"gen_text":"Many of the suspected faulty welds were in Section Five of the pipeline construction project \u2014 the northernmost 200 miles ( 320 km ). This area also included two of the major problems encountered in the entire project that are discussed below:\n\n\nFaulty welds\n\nThe report found that Section Five, where the problems were located has a higher-than-normal likelihood of producing problematic gas flow into the gas field that is owned by Apache. This pipeline crosses the San Gabriel and San Bernardino rivers.\n\nThe sections inspected included five main sections where faults were located: 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4 and 6 (see map). There are a total of 19 separate welds between sections 5-1 to 6, with an average number of welds per section of 32.2. The report found fault activity in sections 5-1, 5-4, 5-7, 5-7B and 5-14. Also, the report found that the flow rate, as well as the maximum flow rate, showed a higher occurrence of high temperatures during the second half of 2013 vs. the first half of 2013.\n\nThis is a significant finding for the pipeline project. Apache had indicated during the early days of construction that it was very unlikely that the pipeline would produce a problem through the San Bernardino river. The report goes so far as to say that there is no reason for concern. At the same time, the report also said that the rate of flow into the gas field had a tendency to increase during the winter. The report suggested that this was because the pipeline carries colder gas, which could require more work to complete.\n\nThe pipeline also carries large quantities of diesel, and as a result, it had a number of cracks in its structure. On average, each crack measured about a quarter of an inch long (5 millimeters). These cracks could indicate that the pipeline may have been weakened. On June 14, 2013, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP) inspected the pipeline's integrity and found no problems.\n\nThe report found that Section Six could be an issue. The section includes the pipelines that carry fuel from one part of the gas field to another. There were also a large number of small cracks that run between the small pieces of pipe. These are found randomly across the pipe. This could indicate that the joints have weakened. This section has yet to be tested, but LADWP said its current plan is to do so over the course of July. A test is not enough, however, to confirm the findings.\n\nThe report does not address the failure point in Section Five. The section is on the border between sections Five and Four, which were tested for flaws earlier. Section Five has two joints that are made of steel, but they are not welded together. These joints show little evidence of cracking, which suggests they are not strong enough to support the much heavier gas they carry.\n\n\"Faulty welds in a major section of the Southern California Gas pipeline could pose risks to the safety of the public, especially for those using this water system,\" said Dr. Karen O'Keefe, a Los Angeles County Public Health Officer. \"We urge the company to implement the corrective measures recommended and hold accountable all individuals at the project and throughout the local community who were allegedly involved in the failure of this critical piece of infrastructure.\"\n\nFor more information regarding the gas pipeline, see the report:\n\nIn addition, the LADWP was charged with implementing the recommendations included in this report. Anyone who believes they may have caused a problem with the gas pipeline can call the LADWP's Energy Investigations Unit at

{"id":2061,"ended":false,"length":580,"gen_text":"The Pentwyn Link Road ( Welsh : Ffordd Gyswllt Pentwyn ), which is also known as the North Pentwyn Link Road, runs from the Pontprennau Interchange ( 51 @. @ < unk> ) in Caernarfon through Caernarfon ( Caernarfon Intersection) to Gwynedd village on the North Wales\/Wales Border. It's a two mile stretch of road and the road is used for regular car traffic. It also has sections where it's used for motorcycle traffic.\n\nIt is a very good, safe highway link between Caernarfon and North Wales and it was actually built after being abandoned by the Welsh Government (for political reasons) and the road is now owned by the National Trust for Wales since 2007.\n\nThe Pentwyn Link Road: Description\n\n(From Wiki): The Pentwyn Link Road is a small fourlane road with narrow lanes, some with kerbs and several with a traffic-cone effect. The road begins in Gwynedd village on the North Wales\/Wales border and continues to Caernarfon where some of the road takes a slight bend towards Caernarfon village.\n\nThe Pentwyn Link Road connects Caernarfon to North Wales and also connects with the Rhymney to Bryngwyrd route where the latter is the main road into Caernarfon village from the Rhymney.\n\nThe road is owned and maintained by the National Trust for Wales and opened to cars on January 6th 2002.\n\nIn February 2005, the road was officially opened as a cycle route after three years of work completed the main cycle\/car-only and bike-only section of the road from Gwynedd, through Caernarfon, up Nantwri, passing Pembroke and on to Caernarfon village.\n\nThe Pentwyn Link Road links Caernarfon ( Wales) with North Wales. It connects Caernarfon with North Wales and also connects with the Rhymney to Bryngwyrd route where the latter is the main road into Caernarfon village from the Rhymney. The Pentwyn Link Road links Caernarfon ( Wales) with North Wales. It connects Caernarfon with North Wales and also connects with the Rhymney to Bryngwyrd route where the latter is the main road into Caernarfon village from the Rhymney.\n\nIn August 2005, the road was officially opened as a bike route after three years of work completed the main, flat, traffic-free cycle route from Caernarfon through Caernarfon then passing Pembroke, on to Caernarfon village, followed by a slightly longer intermediate section.\n\nYou can find the road for bicycles at this link.\n\nWhen to Climb\n\nThere is a weather report for the Pentwyn Link Road, posted at the National Trust website, with the latest updates on the road:\n\nLink Road Weather Report\n\nIt's in the \"Current Currents\" section, along with information on road closures and travel-schedules for the day. On a good day, it can be a pleasant two or three-mile ride.\n\nIt also comes in handy for looking for seasonal workers to go and work at local farms or even pick strawberries.\n\nThe Pentwyn Link Road is a good link to North Wales in general and I've enjoyed many a ride along it in the past. You can see photos of some of the ride's finest times in this Flickr Set of Pentwyn Link Roads - click above for full-screen image.\n\nOther

{"id":2549,"ended":true,"length":650,"gen_text":"The frontage and principal entrance of the Town Hall face the River Roch, and comprises a portico of three arches intersected by buttresses. Decorating the main entrance are stone crockets, gargoyles, and the motto in copperplate: \"Libertas, Pater Noster, et in unum Deum\" meaning \"Liberty and salvation to the whole earth\". The building is one of the earliest buildings in the West Riding and is one of the four remaining of its size after Queen Anne. The frontage is well-defined and rises about 10 ft above the ground. The arches form three tiers and the upper tier contains the portico, which rises from the uppermost of the arch-ways and curves to form three arching galleries. The lower tier, with a central door, is divided into eight chambers or foyers. The foyers are arranged in four pairs, giving the building three tiers with three floors (apart from the portico). Each floor is enclosed by a portico with its own door and an archway at the north-western corner. The portico of the second floor...... 2. The hall. The rear door of the portico is at the north end, open from the entrance, through the archways...... On the other side of the portico are the lower, which is open from the entrance only, and then through the arches to the main entrance. On the north side are the galleries, containing four foyers of seven by eight feet in width. They are of two types. A group of three arches of seven by nine feet and a group of arches of six by ten feet; in between are the foyers. The floor is covered with a heavy and dark oak veneered tapestry at the rear; the arches have gables which extend from the arches to form sides and the sides are decorated. The upper gallery..... 3. The gallery beneath. All the galleries of the south and north side of the upper gallery are of the same type as those immediately above them, and are gabled............... the upper three arches of the north side having gables. The sides are decorated with gables, and have gilded panels on the sides...... 3. The lower gallery below the upper. On the southern side......... The wall of the first gallery............... has high arched roof...... The south-western part of the galleries........................ The gallery....................., was probably part of the original building, the arches being remnants of the old staircase which formerly opened from the front to the side courts by a doorway.\n\n[The first (the north-western) gallery below the lower one contained no arches (now two), as the door was at the north end of the south-western gallery, which itself was divided into seven arches by the arches facing the river. ]\n\n4.

The gallery............................... The gallery........................... In front of the first gallery and the portico.. are steps leading to the porch, to which is attached a large chimney.....\n\nAfter an interval the portico, after being closed off with a broad, open passage, was opened and a small kitchen and dining-room was added.

{"id":4891,"ended":false,"length":723,"gen_text":"Meat has been traded at Smithfield Market for more than 800 years, making it one of the oldest markets in London. A livestock market occupied the site as early as the 10th century, and since the mid-seventeenth century the building has housed a variety of businesses including a flour mill, a linen mill, a silversmith's, and a soap factory. Today its history is being carefully preserved on the site.\nWith its stone facade of gothic and baroque styles and rich interiors, Smithfield Market is one of London's most important landmarks. The market is also famous for its range of stalls selling a wide variety of food, with more than 200 of these stalls now housed in the recently refurbished Market Hall.\nThe Market House was the first of the Market Hall's buildings to be constructed. As a large rectangular building with distinctive masonry, it has long stood out as the most striking feature of the complex, attracting the attention of visitors and history buffs alike.\nThe Market House was an extension of the market's own buildings, making it a centre of the market from its inception in 1363, when it moved from the Market and the Town House. As the market's reputation grew, so too did the building's size, but there were still demands for more space.\nBy the late 1700s, the market also had two public houses, the Hall and Tavern, and the Hall had been expanded so that it was open to the public from 1717. This opened the market to a wider area of the borough, and at the same time, the demand for more space had increased, and so too will the number of traders that use the hall.\nMarket Hall - The Hall and Tavern\nThe market was known as The Inn and Inn Tavern in the early nineteenth century, at the beginning of the market's existence, before being renamed Market Hall in 1828. It is now known as the House of Meat.\nMarket Hall was designed for the market by Adam Wingate, the architect who worked on the White Hart Inn and the new London Stock Exchange, and it was opened for trading in February 1846. Its construction had taken place in stages until the autumn of 1870, when the initial three storey of the building was completed.\nThe original entrance to the original Market Hall was on the west side of the site, near the corner of Holborn Street. From there, one can still see a large sign that reads, \"The hall of meat\". The sign is overgrown now, but the building's original decorative paint, which is still strong, gives a strong impression of the original purpose.\nToday, the market is run by Master of Building, Michael Hutton, and from time to time the market conducts tours of the buildings that make up the Market. Each tour focuses on one of the market's buildings and runs from approximately 10am daily.\nAt the end of July, Master of the Buildings, John Lewis, the present director of Smithfield Market - and a regular visitor - gives a tour of the main part of Market Hall to visitors, explaining the workings of the building to them. It is worth taking a tour, as it provides a nice insight as to just how extensive the building is.\nI also encourage visitors to try to identify some of the other buildings that make up Market Hall by looking through the building to see if there are any parts of the building that bear any resemblance to other similar buildings, or by looking around the building to realise where on the building an office might be.

{"id":2744,"ended":false,"length":671,"gen_text":"In 1955, the Tories, through a determined filibuster, were able to defeat amendments to the Defence Procurement Act, which would have made temporary, extraordinary powers granted to the government permanent.\n\nIt was in the year since those amendments passed that the Conservative government, under Prime Minister Winston Churchill, signed the N\u00fcrnberg Concordat.\n\nConcordat - a treaty - could change the situation entirely.\n\nWith this agreement, Germany agreed to hand over its entire army to the British. The German High Command was now handed over to Britain. This meant that Britain, having the military superiority, would have been able to control the fate of Eastern Europe. There would be no need for a negotiated solution between the two powers since Allied power would have completely overridden Germany's weakness.\n\nN\u00fcrnberg Concordat was the first step towards the eventual unification of Germany.\n\nThe British government realized that they had a massive strategic advantage in Europe, and the new laws were passed with it, so there would be no turning back now.\n\nChurchill made some of the key decisions during those days. One of the most important was the decision to withdraw the British troops from Dunkirk.\n\nChurchill didn't have a reason to leave but there was no real guarantee of being able to help those who had already surrendered. The Dunkirk evacuation was an abject failure and Churchill realized that the only way to save Western Europe was to go forward and defeat Hitler.\n\nEven though there were some difficulties over the next days because of technical mistakes by RAF pilots, the British forces finally landed in France without much of a fight. By the end of 1944, the British forces in France had been largely defeated and were in a desperate situation.\n\nThe Allies realized they had to start winning World War II immediately. The first step in this process was the establishment of a new military command: the Combined Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIf Churchill had been allowed to keep the British troops in France, he almost certainly would have been taken hostage by the Germans with no option of going home.\n\nWith Churchill out of the way, the British cabinet had no choice but to follow the lead of Winston Churchill and the British government.\n\nThus, the UK did not allow Churchill to take the country back, but instead passed the N\u00fcrnberg Concordat and gave Winston Churchill the ultimate responsibility to lead Britain and the world against Nazi Germany.\n\nChurchill knew perfectly well what he had to do to win WW2. As a British military commander who, up until that point, had never been defeated, he needed to be completely certain that he could take on and defeat the most formidable military power in the world, Hitler himself.\n\nChurchill relied on the intelligence reports he had received all along from Germany. He also knew that the Luftwaffe would have to be destroyed, which would not be easy, if at all possible.\n\nIn the end, Winston Churchill was successful - and he won a war in a matter of months.\n\nSource\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Making of the Modern-Day United States of America - by Henry Stimson, Published in 1939\n\nIn the Wake of the War - by Eric Foner, Published in 1997\n\nThe

{"id":892,"ended":false,"length":615,"gen_text":"The Merville Battery was composed of four 6 @ - @ foot @ - @ thick ( 1 @. @ 8 m ) steel @ - @ reinforced concrete gun casemates, built by the U. S. Army for the Merville Battery, 1st Artillery, 6th Division, with all necessary armaments. Its firing platforms were provided for the 3 in. AA.\n\nThis battery was under U. S. Army control and was stationed at Ghent, Belgium and was the only battery of this type in the British zone of control during World War I. The guns were removed and the four gun compartments were taken to the United Kingdom. When the United States entered World War II, the Merville Battery remained in the control of United States Army forces until 1945. The gun crew, which consisted of members of the 6th Division, remained in Belgium while another battery group moved to England. It remained in England until 1949, when it was moved to Campsbridge, England where it will be used to fire on an anti-aircraft battery at Horsham, Kent.\n\nAt 9:50 a.m. on 7 July 1943, Capt. Edward A. O'Flaherty, USNR, began firing the Merville Gun from the 4th Platoon of Company E, 8th Special Troop Carrier Battalion, during the attack on the French towns of Lille and Lorient. Before noon on 7 July, Lieutenant William C. Davis and Cpl. William R. Smith were the only members of the 4th Platoon. The two were killed in the first three hours of the attack, when heavy mortar fire reduced their position to that of bunkers.\n\nAfter the initial period of confusion, the German forces had become more organized and their forces prepared for the long-awaited attack. One attack, launched at 6:05 a.m., gave the British enough time to capture Falaise, a city on the outskirts of Paris; for this the 1st Cavalry Division. The 3d Cavalry and 2d Cavalry Divisions, the British VIII Corps, and the American 11th Armored Regiment succeeded in driving off their way of attack until the Germans were forced to withdraw the following day.\n\nThe Americans used a wide variety of tactics to counter the Merville, including artillery and mortar strikes, night-time infantry attacks, artillery observation and observation balloons, and special attack missions that involved airdrops of heavy explosives over the city.\n\nIn the attack on Lille, the 1st Cav took Lille and held onto it until 8 July, when this attack was abandoned. The 3d Cavalry and 1st Infantry Divisions held onto L'Arche, while the 3d Cavalry and 2d Infantry Divisions secured the port. After these two cities fell, the 11th Armored was committed to the battle and held Lorient; after they captured it, these two cities were retaken by the British.\n\nBy 10 May 1944, the attack on French cities was over.\n\nReferences:\n\nAce, Joseph J. \"Gun Combat of World War I\" in Encyclopedia of Military History, edited by Donald A.

{"id":2702,"ended":true,"length":731,"gen_text":"In 1818, Jennings began promoting a large @ - @ scale plan for internal improvements in the state. Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, canals, and other infrastructure. At one point in the year Jennings wrote to the New York Telegraph to say he was in serious financial trouble. Jennings did begin to pay for the railroads he'd contracted for, however he could not afford the railroads he had sold, so began to rely on his brother to help him pay the bills.\n\nHe also sought the help of other railroad companies to help pay for these projects, and in the fall of 1818, Jennings was forced to write to the Erie & Western Railroad Company, and he said,\n\n\" It has since come to our attention that there are some of our men who have made false claims on the funds placed in their hands during the last months, and it is thought proper that the public should be informed of it, and the interest of the company should be promoted by the appointment of a comptroller to investigate into the whole business. \"\n\nThe following May, Jennings wrote to the Erie & Western, explaining that in the years prior to the bankruptcy, he had spent some of the money spent on the railroads he had paid for. He further wrote,\n\n\" The public want not only the public interest of the state, but public money, and so may be excused for looking with a little suspicion upon the accounts of individuals and business houses, especially those who are connected with business at home and in foreign countries, and who live as foreigners, and who seem to possess a great degree of confidence in their own business and abilities.\"\n\nHe wrote to the Erie & Western, then and now the sole railroad operating company in New York, explaining that this \" should be an important and interesting subject, which the public should examine with the utmost attention, and that if anything is found to be false. we shall take steps to make them so.\"\n\nWhile the Erie & Western was the only railroad operating in the state, Jennings never ceased trying to improve the railroads in any way possible, using almost any financial means at hand, including selling companies, buying up towns, trying to get land grants from the government, and using money from his banks. In the fall of 1818 he had nearly $ 8 million, with a surplus of some 4 million in the year prior. He also secured millions of dollars worth of real estate, using the money to buy up towns. According to Jennings \" We shall pay off the land with interest, and as many new towns as new towns can be made to pay for. I must rely almost entirely on my own resources.\"\n\nThese efforts led to more cities selling off land for development, and he soon began to move his assets all over the state. In the January 1819 bankruptcy document, he wrote,\n\n\" I intend to move the whole business of this part of the country, with the exception of the town of New Town and my estate in New Town, to the town of Hartford by the middle of the spring. I have an estate in Westchester County... to which I intend to move the town of Norwich, the house of offices, & most of the personal effects. \"\n\nAlthough New Town was located in the southern part of the state, it was not far from the Connecticut River, and had a natural harbor.\n\nJ.G.

{"id":3960,"ended":true,"length":647,"gen_text":"The Associated Students of Michigan State University ( ASMSU ) is the all @ - @ university undergraduate student government of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst university student governments for its decentralized nature and its high degree of democracy. The ASMSU consists of members from each of Michigan State's colleges and academic divisions. It also consists of the Student Government Association ( SGA ), the faculty senate, and administration. The ASMSU is elected every four years by its undergraduate group and its faculty senate during the following three academic years. Its main responsibilities are to prepare for the implementation of the University's Strategic Plan for 2016-2018 and coordinate student organization activities with the ASMSU, including student government and campus carry events.\n\nIn 2017, the ASMSU was involved in the student protests over an online video that portrayed two Michigan State fraternity members as sexual harassers while another frat member called her a \"whore.\" When the incident was reported, the ASMSU responded and led the protest against the frat, and later in the year, the ASMSU participated in Student Senate hearings with the goal of making changes to the College's chapter fee.\n\nThe ASMSU's main initiatives in 2017 were the formation of a Campus Carry Alliance and a resolution regarding sexual misconduct. In April, the ASMSU supported the effort to repeal the anti-LGBT campus policy, passed the legislation that created the Campus Carry Alliance, and passed a similar resolution in December regarding sexual misconduct. The ASMSU sponsored a March for Student Rights in Ann Arbor to address campus climate issues as well as hosting a community forum on LGBTQI student experiences and concerns. Additionally, the ASMSU held an event to support the Michigan Democratic Party and elected a new board chair for 2018.\n\nIn June, the ASMSU endorsed Gary Yee for Governor of the State of California. The ASMSU also endorsed Hillary Clinton for President in 2016. All three ASMSU members were elected by an online secret ballot.\n\nIn January of 2018, the ASMSU met with the ASMSU Presidential Elections Committee, held a community Forum on Sexual Assault, and passed a Resolution regarding Sexual Misconduct on Campus at Michigan State University.\n\nThe ASMSU has a board of directors (BOD). The BOD elected a new President in February 2018: Justin F. Kowalski, an ASMSU member who currently serves as the BOD representative for West Michigan.\n\nThe ASMSU has a Council of Student Government Directors (CSGD). Members who serve on the CSGD include ASMSU President Justin F. Kowalski and the current chair of the ASMSU BOD, and the current ASMSU CSGD chair. The CSGD is a two-year executive council of student government directors. In January 2018, the CSGD elected a new CSGD chair: Josephine Kowalski-Trujillo. She is the Vice President of Student Affairs at ASMSU and a member of SGA.\n\nThe ASMSU also maintains a Student Government Association ( SGA ) Board of Directors. The SGA conducts business by a series of meetings in October called the Fall Meeting. In September 2018, the ASMSU also elected a new SGA president: Ryan D. Miller, an ASMSU student member currently serving as the SGA representative for New York City.\n\nIn June 2018, the ASMSU elected a new President: Jonathan P. Hinton.

{"id":991,"ended":false,"length":663,"gen_text":"A weak disturbance was first observed near Grand Cayman on August 23, gaining tropical storm strength by 0600 UTC that day. Moving towards the north @ - @ northwest, the storm passed west-northwest of Grand Cayman to become a Category 1 hurricane at 0732 UTC on August 24, then moved eastbound @ 0nm S to become a Category 3 hurricane at 0631 UTC on August 25. The storm was centred near latitude 42.5 North and longitude 64.4 East during the early hours of the 24-hour period. At 0430 UTC on August 25, Hurricane Wilma made landfall near North Saint Thomas, Dominican Republic with 115 km\/h (75 mph) winds and a central pressure of 994 mb. At 1500 UTC with a central pressure of 993 mb, Wilma had maximum sustained winds of 110 m\/s (249 mph) with a central pressure of 993 mb. The storm remained a Category 3 hurricane for the next 24 hours, increasing strength with increasing wind speed. Maximum sustained winds decreased to 85 m\/s (203 mph) with a central pressure of 986 mb by 0900 UTC on the 26th. This gradual decline to Category 3 was a direct result of the storm moving towards the west-northwest, weakening from a Category 1 to a Category 2 hurricane in about 24 hours.\n\nHazardous weather is a major risk for the Dominican Republic. Meteorological models projected the tropical cyclone to strengthen further during the next several hours and may approach over the islands. A weakening cyclone then entered the Caribbean basin on Sunday morning.\n\nAfter this last storm passed, Tropical Storm Harvey arrived in the Texas coast at 7 am EDT, moving southeastward at 8 mph. During the past 24 hours, Harvey strengthened to a major hurricane, with winds up to 150 mph (230 kph). Harvey is expected to make landfall on the Texas coast in less than 48 hrs. At this time, the central pressure is expected to be over 1000 mb during the weekend. There is little to no threat of storm surge, due to the low relative humidity, and near-surface winds are blowing at about 12-13 knots (14 miles per hour).\n\nMeteorologists at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of the potential for a potential path shift for storms in the Texas Gulf Coast and Southeast United States. The potential shift for Harvey and Hurricane Irma has a maximum track width of 20 to 25 miles, and is predicted to hit the Gulf Coast first. As Harvey approaches land, there, it is likely to weaken to a low level hurricane, then weaken again into a tropical storm.\n\nThe NHC is preparing for the possibility of additional storms, but it appears unlikely any additional tropical storms will make landfall this fall. This is primarily due to the weak atmosphere and the relatively large size of Harvey, which is also smaller than the previous two hurricanes, Wilma and Rita. The NHC does have an increased risk of a path shift for Harvey, but no new events are in the forecast at this time.\n\n[NOTE: National Weather Service forecasts for this weekend have changed to reflect the most recent research (including latest estimates from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Tropical Forecast Unit.)]\n\n\nLinks:\n\nLatest Global Modeling\n\nHurricane Harvey

When it drains these portions of its basin eastward, it causes the Missouri to form a very large northern lake.

{"id":607,"ended":true,"length":677,"gen_text":"Tennyson penned `` Ulysses `` after the death of his close Cambridge friend, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam ( 1811 \u2013 1833 ), with whom Tennyson had a strong emotional bond. The final line in the poem expresses the poet's grief and wonderment at the fate of his dear friend. In this section, Tennyson describes how Hallam's mind and body gradually succumbed to his afflictions, but `` Ulysses is not really about his death; it is about his life. He lives to see yet another sunrise on the high seas and still he is not satisfied. He feels that he must make new beginnings, that he must go on with his life, that he must live the life that he had never lived before. It is hard to tell, with a perfect knowledge, what that life may be, because we are not what we once were. But he must try to live it.'' One of Mr. Hallam's last poems included the following lyrics from Tennyson and is reproduced here:\n\n\nI, there in the woods, have killed a man who tried to save some of mine\n\ntrees. This may be the last I ever do\n\ntill there's not one on which I have not cut down.\n\nAnd from your life you have taken a good bit of mine,\n\nall that's left of it, though so long ago,\n\nI think I cannot do without you...\n\n\nI don't feel at all sorrowful over my life's end...\n\nAnd because I have never been as brave, never done harder\n\nwork, never done like you, I cannot tell\n\nhow sad you must feel, if it is, indeed, the death\n\nof a good friend and brother. But this I feel\n\nthe more I think of it, in the long run...\n\n\nNow if I do not go before you...\n\n\nIt is time for me, the last of my life, to be out\n\nbetween the light and shadows of the world,\n\nbetween the life you leave behind and the life\n\nthrown at me. I must follow you to the grave...\n\n\nThere is nothing that a good dead friend can do\n\nfor me, you know, nothing else. He can do nothing\n\ngreater than tell me the secret of my life and\n\ntell it on the world's final day... I do not care\n\nwhither I shall go. I feel that I, my wife, my sons,\n\nand this place must be gone. I must live.\n\n\nThen they will laugh at us, and we will laugh,\n\nif it does not please them to kill two birds with one stone.\n\nAnd when the darkness falls and the trees are hushed,\n\nI will hold in my arms her face, that I have loved so,\n\nthat I have loved so long - and yet she is dead.\n\n\nAll the rest of my life, except this, I feel\n\nthe most hopeless and pitiable--and that I am sure.\n\n\nWith that in mind I have never wanted anything more;\n\nI only want what is dead in me to live again.\n\n\nIn his final work, Tennyson wrote: The Man Who Had No Name, a poem that is often overlooked in the history of The Lord of the Rings. The novel ends on a note of disappointment not unlike the death scene in Ulysses, when Bilbo's quest to discover the meaning of Bilbo's name ends as he enters the chamber of Erebor, the Dwarven city that once inhabited the Lonely Mountain, and his quest with Frodo of the One Ring, the artifact that will forever change the face of Middle-earth.","token_len":775,"entropy":[9.2316,9.5395,12.29,10.976,0.0963,0.0003,2.7512,4.0614,1.779,1.2467,0.0242,0.943,4.7648,14.3378,0.2709,1.1127,1.4388,1.1417,5.0705,6.5614,5.6596,0.5878,3.0343,7.8621,3.9419,3.9795,0.3206,6.1666,1.4543,4.1716,0.2545,5.6078,0.0043,1.3296,1.9567,4.0592,3.2377,1.1458,0.2593,2.3139,5.1256,1.601,3.1038,0.6431,0.5103,5.2798,1.0828,1.3723,0.0087,2.0735,1.8895,5.2205,2.931,0.7806,0.4818,5.0538,0.1399,1.4451,4.239,0.0536,1.0548,3.1319,3.2713,4.4258,0.778,1.4749,0.001,3.199,2.3713,0.9118,0.0007,1.4442,5.563,2.3974,0.8584,4.6305,3.085,0.0791,2.6868,5.6059,0.6534,0.0173,1.2117,3.8945,5.8996,1.7449,0.0018,0.0,4.4148,2.1078,4.0882,0.9031,2.6136,1.2092,2.6731,0.4688,0.2425,0.4283,1.0894,1.1566,1.7215,2.8279,3.9902,3.6394,2.9644,6.2288,0.3362,3.0305,3.5932,0.608,5.6794,3.2776,2.6538,4.5566,2.6189,2.2339,1.7875,2.042,0.7845,1.133,4.7278,1.1416,0.9552,2.393,4.4611,5.4822,3.3032,1.5433,2.4656,0.6489,0.2207,2.1052,0.6311,3.4112,0.5769,1.139,1.3709,1.4044,0.4971,0.3006,2.9054,4.0977,1.3651,1.6707,0.6535,2.8808,5.274,1.9108,0.4749,0.7697,3.5107,0.2501,5.0544,0.8518,4.0043,3.3577,4.45,2.451,5.933,3.3641,2.7173,1.5325,3.4966,0.2502,3.8581,0.0857,1.1066,4.2465,3.2446,1.7283,1.5986,4.9326,0.063,2.1737,0.0223,0.681,1.3819,2.5792,3.3297,2.8512,1.5459,1.428,1.628,3.4096,5.7352,0.8685,7.2426,0.0131,1.1773,0.0141,0.0111,1.7332,1.6499,6.0991,0.8238,1.5474,6.0847,4.7633,2.8721,0.0024,5.6993,3.0345,4.21,1.0373,1.1126,4.8969,0.0008,2.7481,4.6804,5.891,2.0724,0.6154,4.9212,0.3917,4.4326,5.665,1.1803,1.0996,4.8374,4.807,0.1343,5.5787,6.01,2.2588,2.541,1.7564,0.0002,5.287,1.09,1.1034,5.1092,5.2335,1.2431,1.745,1.3102,2.8319,1.4442,1.0392,2.7514,0.0002,4.6735,0.1522,4.7678,2.74,4.136,1.7202,4.562,3.6133,0.5902,2.0509,1.2861,2.3767,2.0809,0.5158,0.6886,0.0002,3.1951,5.4927,5.9273,4.5245,3.614,1.9196,1.0949,1.868,5.0184,4.8954,0.8915,0.1512,1.4852,0.1763,0.0003,5.4731,1.8509,2.4974,0.9049,0.8174,1.2854,1.3665,4.3129,6.0733,3.9189,0.8739,2.2118,0.4303,0.0003,2.3601,3.6162,1.7608,5.0896,5.1253,2.3849,0.8361,6.3504,0.8332,0.0003,3.4106,4.6649,0.0019,4.1339,3.4311,0.3931,5.7204,0.1273,3.5396,2.272,3.142,2.7676,1.4889,4.2206,0.5445,0.0002,3.8789,5.9172,0.719,1.8257,3.5928,1.6519,4.6828,4.2157,3.0756,4.7165,3.9646,7.7095,0.6333,0.0004,1.3141,0.6223,1.8994,3.0544,7.0673,0.8945,0.373,0.863,3.018,4.0014,1.7356,0.0003,1.8789,4.8996,3.0499,0.672,0.9691,1.7596,3.9495,3.568,0.8251,4.0503,1.304,0.0273,1.0475,4.4046,0.9593,0.0002,0.1675,1.4976,3.5239,0.6238,3.4819,3.7555,0.7714,2.7846,4.8901,2.5046,3.3394,2.0348,0.0003,5.0434,1.6562,2.7617,0.9736,0.525,0.9272,0.4966,5.4793,1.7203,4.5335,1.5886,2.1977,0.2796,0.0003,5.2351,4.0294,1.3351,4.0559,0.9045,3.5216,5.1763,1.0866,5.1863,2.1968,0.0002,3.7965,0.7798,4.7425,1.5583,0.3595,2.5905,3.4472,1.8779,0.9597,1.2044,2.1221,0.2444,0.7462,3.8016,4.876,2.7976,0.0002,6.6616,0.2821,4.7469,0.2284,3.0997,1.1358,0.8223,1.4537,0.9519,0.2544,0.0003,2.4975,0.5652,4.5812,4.0379,5.024,0.6234,0.6343,0.2007,0.2556,0.63,0.0002,7.5848,0.3994,4.1424,0.6746,1.9405,1.6183,2.2562,5.2446,0.5579,3.0776,0.3936,3.4117,2.8276,0.2917,0.0003,4.2871,0.7757,2.7594,3.0002,4.7814,3.4286,6.1971,1.7031,0.3797,0.845,1.0328,0.0003,0.8507,0.7653,1.0908,5.4814,1.2793,1.1621,2.4983,6.3789,3.4048,2.9607,2.2137,3.0935,0.5585,0.3229,0.0002,6.0324,0.5833,0.5692,4.3496,0.3184,2.4931,3.6685,0.3215,1.4621,0.9377,3.706,0.5969,0.0002,2.1683,1.3585,6.211,1.9971,5.2749,0.731,4.8562,0.4015,1.8537,4.4127,3.5385,0.123,3.2578,0.5846,0.0002,4.9281,0.6209,1.1555,2.108,0.2315,2.4987,0.7111,4.2533,1.2453,0.731,7.4427,4.1889,5.1826,0.6362,1.0759,4.1207,0.3973,0.1309,0.0003,1.2569,5.3729,4.5055,3.5048,2.2824,3.3782,1.8341,1.4484,2.2441,3.369,3.9632,1.1426,0.0003,5.0851,4.9568,1.8566,4.3997,0.4767,3.8181,0.9186,1.6239,1.963,0.9315,2.3663,2.3051,0.4095,0.0003,4.1085,3.2189,4.1476,0.2277,4.4861,0.4383,1.0786,3.6791,7.9112,1.7914,0.0473,0.1536,0.035,0.7977,0.5174,0.0002,2.107,3.0586,2.2159,5.3834,1.7647,1.9227,0.4417,4.8367,1.5047,5.8895,0.0465,0.8808,0.0248,0.0002,1.7915,1.0744,5.3797,3.441,0.0743,2.125,6.1841,2.2423,1.0252,3.8648,1.6507,1.9194,1.3656,1.7187,1.3688,0.0158,0.0003,1.9615,0.3531,0.4465,0.7486,1.4327,0.8024,6.4977,1.0991,4.961,2.3509,0.8409,1.1039,0.4657,0.577,0.0004,5.4039,1.994,3.2247,0.5978,0.5285,0.2678,1.8155,5.65,2.7438,1.4612,1.2361,3.6941,1.8147,0.0003,3.9282,2.5705,5.3216,1.7674,4.9038,1.1372,6.5774,2.4002,3.4269,2.4587,2.9309,4.0488,1.5993,1.4559,0.0003,5.4724,3.4713,3.5343,0.3375,2.0571,3.0448,4.1462,5.3352,3.3269,2.1615,3.7139,0.0237,0.0003,1.1063,4.3388,1.0743,3.4054,1.6485,5.5369,3.7901,0.3825,1.1494,2.3872,1.784,0.5199,0.7547,0.0003,4.2838,2.6628,2.5943,3.7999,0.1697,1.8327,0.0013,2.2799,2.3476,4.6483,5.5391,0.5978,3.8863,2.7668,0.5104,2.7711,2.8731,1.7682,1.6574,2.3732,2.595,5.2607,1.2425,1.1268,3.1679,0.0222,5.5019,0.6645,0.0711,0.0071,0.016,0.9536,1.8393,5.7878,4.4178,3.3636,0.7825,1.0092,0.2812,4.9965,5.7419,1.439,0.8215,2.2816,4.3441,1.0565,1.5493,0.001,0.0002,1.5488,3.6904,3.4856,0.0002,2.3044,2.8218,2.2495,

{"id":4839,"ended":true,"length":745,"gen_text":"British singer @ - @ songwriter, Pixie Lott, covered the song for the re @ - @ issue of her debut album, Turn It Up. Then in the second week of February '09, that song came out as the main single from the album!\n\nThe single came with a music video produced by @ @ @ Michael Jackson's long time production team - a film entitled The Greatest Show on Earth. Then after that, it was followed by the movie @ @ The Dark Horse movie.\n\nThen on the 20th of February, @ @ J. Cole, @ @ his group @ @ The Block, @ @ J. Cole debuted their song, #Fam, and #Empire on the Billboard charts @ @ #.\n\nThen on the 5th of March, #NothinButUs, a song that J. Cole created with his brother, @ @ Joey Blanton, was released on the Billboard charts @ @ #!\n\nAfter that, the week after, J. Cole released a new song, Black Star, on the Billboard charts @ @ #.\n\nJ. Cole, @ @ in this clip from this weekend's show @ - @ on BET, tells us that when he created his new album, Black Star, he didn't know where the album would land. His brother, who was also playing the drums, was the lead singer on the songs, So This is How we Grow. When Cole first started working with his brother on the music, the drumming was a little rough because he was new to drums. As he learned drums over the years, the rhythm of the song shifted and the drummer became less involved. As he worked with his brother, then as a solo artist, he started to focus on his writing and writing his own lyrics. After the song is done, Cole says the music was written in three days. So if you didn't notice any change in Cole from before to after the time spent with his brother composing the music, you don't know where this is going. Cole starts with the first verse, then he adds a verse for the next half hour.\n\nHis voice, @ @ he tells us at one point during the song, \"is not very high, but that's how I sing\". Then the next part, he says, \"the lyrics are a little strange and I do all these things that are hard for me to say\". He tells the audience where the song is headed to and what he has to say about it. Cole tells us that he started working, literally, \"a couple of months ago\", and in the past, he has usually wrote his songs a year in advance. When he started working with his brother, he didn't know where the album would land. Cole's brother, like him, is a newcomer to the songwriting thing. He says he didn't know \"how we were going to sell this\". He also doesn't take much credit for writing the new song and doesn't want to.\n\nAll in the end, Cole tells us that, \"the song that I wrote is called #BlackStar\". He adds that \"I am a creative genius\", and \"you can't imagine how hard\" it was to write. He says \"I wrote the first verse in three days.\" Cole shows why he's called the new rapper of rap, a rapper who's a bit of a \"creature\". He also explains why he's on BET on a Friday morning.\n\nThe show continues with the second part of the show. The show concludes with #StayingPower, a song by Cole that featured his brother on drums.

{"id":2512,"ended":false,"length":657,"gen_text":"After the Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu event, K\u012blauea remained relatively quiet, and, for a time, completely silent, with all activity confined to the summit. It came alive again in 1952 with an eruption that caused one of the largest known earthquakes in the southern hemisphere. The eruption was preceded by a vigorous tremor swarm from K\u012blauea.\n\nAn eruption in April 1953, producing a crater on the summit near the summit crater, has become known as the 'great blast event' and the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the island-region. On 30 April 1953, seismic data collected by the US Naval Observatory was used to determine the location of the new summit crater, with the earthquake event being located near the summit crater. Several days later, K\u012blauea's summit crater was fully erupted, producing a tremendous amount of gas and a large eruption cloud with the potential to produce a huge ash cloud.\n\nA short distance away, the northern end of Koh\u0101nauma is where the majority of activity, and most of the recorded earthquakes date from.\n\nThe volcano erupted several times with activity varying from a small ash emission to the production of a powerful lava dome. A major magma explosion on 20 April 1970 was recorded as the most powerful in recorded Hawaiian history. From 6 to 14 June 1979 the volcano erupted one volcano-sized, 30 meter high (985 ft) pyroclastic flow, which ejected material approximately 3,000 m (10,000 ft), covering over 6 km (3 mi). The two days of activity following that incident caused thousands of additional earthquakes. The flows traveled at a slow rate for over a year and produced material of considerable depth.\n\nA second significant eruption occurred on 11 October 1990. During this eruption, a lava dome and multiple lava flows descended from Mauna Loa onto a large area of forest. The flows traveled for a distance of over 12 km (7 mi), traveling from Mauna Loa to Koh\u0101nauma (2.4 km or 1.6 mi) and covered an area of over 60,000 ha (148,000 ha or 190,000 sq mi). Although, it was the heaviest lava flow eruption in recorded Hawaiian history, less than 30 cm (1.5 inches) of lava was ejected in this event, with the flows covering 8 km (5 mi) and moving at several mile per hour (4 kph).\n\nSeveral smaller eruptions have occurred on the southeast flank since about 2003. On 08 April 2007 a lava flow 1.3 km (0.9 mi) long and 0.7\u20132.3 km (0.2.0\u20134.3 mi) wide erupted from the summit, with the main explosion at 10.15 am. The two largest eruptions occurred on March 10 2002 (6.7 km; or 3 mi) and June 9 2006 (4 km; or 2 mi). The lava flows covered a distance of approximately 10,000 ha (27,360 ha or 71,500 sq mi).\n\nReferences\n\nPaleozoic Climate History in Hawaii, J. R. McNeill, P. G.

{"id":3857,"ended":true,"length":710,"gen_text":"On 3 October 2014 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that former franchisees asserted that the current franchisor, NBC Capital, had stopped print and media advertising since purchasing the business. The number of active retail sites has dropped in the year since the sale, with only 50 stores remaining today -- half of them in Australia and 13 in New Zealand.\n\nWhile the majority of the franchisees said that they could not reveal specifics, those who spoke out did acknowledge that some store managers were not aware of the conditions.\n\nIt is reported that about 10 percent of stores are closed and un-employable.\n\nA New Zealand franchisee who was forced to relocate told the Sydney Morning Herald that the franchisee he had previously dealt with had \"very tight control over our shop employees.\" A former employee in Australia confirmed that managers were not aware of what conditions the employees were being forced to live away from home. One person with 20 years working in franchising claims that during the time she worked, franchisees were advised they had to move to an office park in the north-western part of Sydney so some of the stores could stay open overnight.\n\nIt is said that the remaining stores on the West Coast and in Australia's outer regions are now being run by a new franchisee (we have no further comment). The franchisees' claims of poor service, unpaid wages, lack of work experience, and a lack of opportunities is being investigated by News Corp Australia.\n\nThere are currently over 870 franchised McDonald's restaurants across Australia, over half in NSW. They represent more than 15 percent of the total food outlets in Australia, with 728 in NSW, and about 400 in Victoria.\n\nIt is estimated that McDonald's Australia generate over $130 million in annual profits, and their annual revenue for 2010 was $2.9 billion. The franchisees have very little power in franchising matters and are extremely vulnerable to exploitation. They are also being coerced into accepting exploitative terms by large American multi-nationals.\n\nAustralian franchisees have been told they must sign with US multi-national companies, such as McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's; and, sign restrictive employment contracts. These companies have threatened to close their shops if they turn away a large number of McDonalds customers.\n\nMcDonald's Australia is also offering franchisees a percentage of their profit in one-off payments. They must also sign multi-year employment contracts, with severe obligations to pay their employees wages and holidays, despite the fact that these agreements are known to be non-union.\n\nThese contracts are a breach of Australian Employment legislation, and they force workers out of the franchise and into insecure jobs with precarious employment and conditions of employment, to the benefit of companies. The only time a franchisee ever has any control over their jobs is during the final stages of a deal.\n\nThe corporate giants behind the franchiseing of fast food have a strong financial interest in driving competition and lowering standards, and reducing local wages and working conditions. This in turn puts downward pressure on prices, benefiting the profits of multinationals.\n\nThis is of intense concern as the global financial crisis has demonstrated that workers (including those in regional parts of Australia) have been most severely impacted by it. It also illustrates the power of multinationals to exert political pressure and social exclusion in places where they perceive economic advantage.\n\nAs with all things exploitative, the struggle to raise workers' standards will only succeed when organised as part of a broader independent movement of working people; we therefore support the struggle of members of the public, trade unionists,

{"id":1696,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"In May 2016 it was revealed that Fowler would return to the pitch to play for England in Soccer Aid, a charity football match in aid of UNICEF, alongside Jamie Carragher. =\nBastian Schweinsteiger will not be on the pitch at the Stadium of Light in June with the German defender having recovered from a serious foot injury, and that leaves him out of a number of major tournaments. In the build-up to this season, it was reported that he had suffered a setback to his recovery which meant he would not be fit enough to play at the Olympics. A further setback in the new year saw him being ruled out of the first game of the season against Crystal Palace, but he will be on the bench at Old Trafford as Bayern Munich face Manchester City the following weekend. If he is included, Schweinsteiger would still be available for the Germany match away in the US, which means he will start in place of Michael Carrick for some important World Cup qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina in October.\nToni Kroos is probably the player most linked with a move away from Munich, given that the club's record signing is due to get married in May and then a second child is set to arrive in November. Bayern are eager to keep Kroos, but he is likely to command a greater transfer fee this summer which will see them move fast to make a move. It is thought that Manchester United, Chelsea and the newly crowned Premier League champions Leicester City have already shown an interest in Kroos. At this stage, no firm \u00a320m bids have been made but reports suggest that United would like to get at least \u00a330m for Kroos.\nThis comes after the midfielder made headlines for the wrong reasons in January on his birthday, when he told his fianc\u00e9e at dinner that he wanted a'really very long-term relationship' with her. Kroos is now said to be 'deeply ashamed' of the comments, but it doesn't seem to faze the Bayern Munich hierarchy. There is little doubt that he has been the club's most decisive player during the first half of the season, impressing at both right-back and on the wing.\nIf the big three clubs did turn their attentions to Kroos, Bayern would do well to stay patient with the 26-year-old. When he has had one season of first team football at Bayern, the midfielder has always been the one to carry it over into the second. The likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arturo Vidal all had success in this fashion, despite starting their careers at the Allianz Arena. The best example would be Thomas Mueller, who played at Bayern from 2009 until 2013 before moving to Real Madrid.\nIt all seems set to continue for the 25-year-old, with Bayern currently sitting seven points behind the leaders Bayern Munich. A trip to the Allianz Arena to take on Jupp Heynckes and Bayern will be looking to finish off the season on a high by claiming a sixth Bundesliga title.\nHowever, for anyone who saw the game against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League Quarter Final in October, the season is hardly over yet for Bayern. A draw there would still have denied Bayern the Champions League spot that was in their sights, but it also took Dortmund two minutes to score when Henrikh Mkhitaryan put the ball past Manuel Neuer. In the dying seconds of the match, Arjen Robben found himself one-on-one with Neuer, but Neuer made a spectacular save from the Netherlands international. As well as the Champions League, the Bundesliga will still have its title-decider on the last matchday as Bayern look to secure a first title for three years by securing their seventh Bundesliga title.","token_len":779,"entropy":[5.9726,3.2198,6.0867,0.4255,1.4743,0.184,11.7893,3.4102,4.1925,0.4174,0.934,6.126,4.0705,1.8322,0.8722,3.3628,1.4157,12.0754,4.9524,1.8555,1.4487,1.2617,2.6589,0.8788,2.1675,2.566,0.0235,2.8128,0.0007,0.0007,1.9637,5.1915,4.9532,1.9729,0.0001,1.8783,14.333,1.8431,9.2107,4.4839,0.3054,0.0066,0.0014,0.0,0.0001,3.1805,2.8938,0.951,3.9846,0.4194,1.8338,1.8279,1.3152,4.3548,0.0394,0.0011,2.8413,4.71,4.7721,0.8856,1.562,3.9145,2.3431,4.2734,0.0512,0.6196,3.222,4.4486,0.0706,2.7214,2.6392,4.9343,4.0535,5.4919,2.6956,0.169,4.6721,1.852,0.0044,5.6913,1.2205,1.3239,3.9803,1.9667,3.9956,0.6601,0.0012,0.0557,2.8824,3.5551,1.5094,2.3509,0.2698,1.3324,0.1287,1.6991,1.4573,3.2313,0.5409,1.5683,2.5789,0.1509,0.8399,3.638,1.8981,0.3853,0.6089,0.9519,0.1476,1.7184,3.0077,0.2743,1.1123,2.4887,0.9436,3.6119,0.8553,4.6408,3.7255,0.9385,2.3139,1.5071,5.3212,0.0778,1.8886,0.4823,5.2337,0.819,0.0024,0.6113,0.662,4.2705,2.207,0.1244,0.1638,0.5825,0.832,3.4606,0.0008,1.6763,2.4191,1.0753,2.8868,1.0832,4.7545,0.1929,1.0526,2.2416,3.0595,0.0003,3.7768,2.9497,0.2286,2.4724,0.9992,0.5161,6.6983,0.3607,1.1524,0.1263,4.782,0.9414,1.1778,4.8623,1.1774,2.5269,0.0185,0.0001,0.0001,1.68,5.1877,0.6366,3.4988,0.2683,0.83,5.4365,3.0782,6.0845,3.3879,2.1102,4.4166,1.7468,2.9002,3.6718,0.8396,1.5771,5.2963,2.1051,3.1763,0.0024,5.1323,0.9759,0.0,2.6761,5.6963,4.89,2.6304,0.0147,0.1063,2.4576,2.8377,1.4146,0.001,0.0565,0.0003,0.0009,0.0006,2.6679,2.6872,1.4486,0.9988,5.6228,1.7869,0.0007,0.0,1.6023,5.7461,0.6271,2.3366,1.2342,3.7814,0.2771,0.4728,0.2826,0.6707,0.1646,3.753,1.3131,4.9666,1.4038,2.473,1.8591,2.2973,4.9458,0.5652,1.6071,3.3768,0.1133,5.6625,3.0531,0.9551,2.8606,1.3374,4.5257,4.8893,4.8709,0.4186,0.887,3.316,0.0365,0.5528,0.637,3.1202,0.1761,3.8832,1.8184,5.1413,0.112,1.1781,2.08,0.0003,1.2163,0.8912,2.4076,1.1337,2.9483,0.0178,2.9674,0.3008,5.4217,1.4763,0.025,4.5402,0.1167,6.4784,1.6674,3.2379,1.6436,4.0198,5.7077,0.4486,3.5525,0.8894,1.8503,0.8862,3.4745,0.7838,2.6284,0.2911,3.0324,0.0963,2.0838,1.4492,0.4555,5.1258,5.815,3.0209,1.7474,0.0055,0.0738,3.5442,0.2761,1.5252,3.5389,1.9705,0.3384,0.0034,0.3793,0.7546,0.0007,1.122,5.0253,1.9201,0.5104,0.5594,3.3057,4.2044,6.9254,1.9615,0.7356,3.22,0.135,0.0926,0.7393,3.1304,5.1026,1.3463,0.3734,2.584,3.5677,3.1488,0.2503,3.5977,3.9029,0.0119,0.2042,1.6337,0.0119,0.4323,1.38,0.0005,0.7391,1.0788,4.609,5.9395,1.2268,2.1642,3.8234,3.5836,3.2686,2.3197,2.4457,0.0561,0.0263,1.4991,2.2728,6.5786,1.6862,3.0662,1.616,0.8155,0.1954,4.8851,1.5634,5.8868,0.1579,0.0032,5.3308,4.1389,0.3661,0.1752,1.8755,2.7457,17.5997,6.6909,7.2532,5.1544,2.9774,0.0707,1.8658,3.1931,1.5829,0.368,0.3636,2.4088,0.001,2.3554,3.2004,2.8702,0.0131,0.3594,2.287,3.9404,0.0101,4.438,0.2413,0.5904,1.2689,1.6473,0.9891,1.3035,2.3234,4.6219,0.0013,1.5303,0.9874,5.804,0.001,2.4215,3.2962,1.8147,4.2178,0.9109,3.9854,1.1292,4.0074,0.2768,0.1597,1.5181,2.4812,2.2798,2.4404,2.5924,0.0101,1.538,7.0276,0.3318,3.565,0.5778,2.6723,0.1503,0.0076,0.1822,0.2981,0.6735,5.5754,0.0016,3.2343,1.612,2.0906,0.631,0.031,0.0515,3.3703,0.0271,1.9587,0.7339,1.4272,4.0051,2.8163,5.2116,4.8955,1.6126,4.3063,5.6756,0.3416,0.9836,0.0001,0.4647,0.1552,0.0011,0.338,3.3992,0.5421,5.2996,0.1898,0.0269,5.1152,1.1086,2.436,1.1324,3.7118,0.2396,0.0034,0.0603,0.0006,1.0088,5.4734,0.9789,3.2206,2.4772,5.5847,3.7528,1.4706,2.5713,0.7429,0.0715,2.5044,0.8283,0.3579,2.4791,2.6133,0.1431,3.3111,1.2878,3.3076,3.1286,1.0569,4.6308,3.6638,4.9561,1.1093,0.3343,0.5665,1.0278,2.9363,3.9022,0.0036,2.296,0.0062,0.0007,0.0024,0.0002,0.0002,0.4939,3.1997,0.0002,0.0954,0.0,0.0001,0.2715,6.4042,0.0015,0.0004,0.0,2.282,1.8394,4.6944,1.095,4.2605,2.5535,0.7753,5.0257,4.0208,1.0165,0.4566,0.673,1.9731,2.1374,0.0004,0.0003,0.0376,0.448,3.2382,4.5257,0.8754,3.9496,0.3945,2.4056,2.3703,0.3561,0.1616,3.1746,2.5576,1.0274,1.0238,3.4864,1.8603,1.6588,1.1424,1.0086,0.2246,2.5763,0.0138,0.7442,0.9322,3.1244,6.4096,2.4202,4.6888,0.8043,1.5383,0.8465,2.9429,5.7643,0.0435,0.0133,0.0117,0.0008,0.8754,1.9381,1.6817,5.1344,1.8787,6.2996,0.0113,1.7744,1.9574,0.7413,3.1546,0.1256,1.1626,3.5925,4.5625,0.0281,1.442,0.792,0.0003,0.0005,0.0378,1.2847,2.1124,0.0071,5.2038,0.4589,0.0006,0.0002,0.0001,0.0,4.1354,2.429,2.3901,0.7377,2.2419,0.2346,5.3202,2.7144,1.1696,0.7383,1.5296,0.0632,0.1086,4.2769,2.8903,1.5247,3.0197,1.1577,0.1561,0.5159,1.3641,4.998,0.0538,4.7444,4.6191,1.4711,4.6949,1.2074,4.2493,1.0414,2.1925,0.0005,0.1796,1.237,0.6961,0.5427,0.0083,7.0188,0.7513,2.5804,3.5414,0.1461,2.1645,4.1653,1.3551,5.012,0.3206,1.2073,2.4098,0.4926,0.8445,3.2296,3.2469,3.4589,0.8665,3.3169,1.0068,6.5413,1.5457,1.1791,2.9418,0.007,3.6802,2.7567,2.7744,3.179,0.5771,0.692,0.7495,1.0973,2.4944,3.5025,5.4346,3.0211,3.6798,4.905,0.0614,1.0421,4.4445,3.5567,0.0001,0.0027,0.0001,0.0,0.0005,0.0002,3.4234,1.826,0.4471,1.7996,0.4958,0.0,0.0002,0.5437,3.5846,0.9622,5.3053,1.1304,0.6523,0.2585,1.4474,0.2254,4.2959,0.0002,0.0001,0.0002,4.4352,0.7086,2.7305,0.6737,0.008,0.0014,0.0028,0.073

{"id":7,"ended":true,"length":754,"gen_text":"In the late 1920s, Barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works. Family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works, but Barker refused.\n\n\nBarker later said that many of her relatives refused to accept her conversion and urged her to continue doing her secular work.\n\n\nAn article in the New York Herald Tribune of October 26, 1927, indicated that Barker had become more active in her secular work and had stopped doing any work for the church, and that she now had a regular job at the Bronx-based National World War I centennial fund.\n\n\nShe was honored with a medal of honor by President Herbert Hoover and he said, '' As a woman preacher she is the most dynamic figure. A woman of that type may be more easily accepted than a man minister who prefers to preach in another style. But Barker is too active. She is an inspiration to others and especially to me. I hope and pray that she will devote all her strength to our cause as a woman minister. In a generation or so some of the other female ministers will have to give up the ministry in order to become nuns and to give up their lives in holy orders. The day when woman can be a nun is but a very distant one. On the other hand, one of the saddest sights I ever saw is a great many people now living who will probably do nothing to further the cause of the Church until the end of time, when every human life will be so much less important in God's sight. The women as they are now cannot be expected to make an effort to promote religion. They cannot and they cannot. It is very dangerous to encourage the clergy, and I can only repeat the words of Blessed Paul : '' It is for the church that I must be a preacher \". It is in the true ministry of the church that the power of the kingdom of heaven is exerted. The power of the church is expressed by her voice and by the work of her ministry. I earnestly desire that the women ministers of the church are given the same opportunity to do for the people of God what I have been given, because I know that when one gives all her energy to God and the people of God and becomes a woman saint, God will do even more for them. For some of my Christian friends were very uneasy and uneasy about my work as a woman minister. They said that I was preaching the gospel in women's clothes. They had to be convinced that the gospel of Jesus Christ could be preached by a woman, and that women ministers would not be able to convert women to Christianity, otherwise the gospel would be lost if it were not that women would be converted so that more girls might take our Lord's gospel and learn to follow it. We should all understand that we should live the gospel as Jesus Christ was preached by God's ordained ministers in their own special fashion.'' A prominent woman journalist expressed much the same thing in a article published in the New York International Herald Tribune on March 12, 1928, in the midst of the campaign to ordain women.\n\n\nThis is perhaps the best picture of the Rev. Gertrude (Miss) Barker as a preacher. The story of how she became one of America's most prominent female ministers is told in the book Women Preachers of the Second Centuries, edited by Paul Williams.\n\n\nBarker was a good theologian and was invited to lecture on women's theology by her alma mater on several occasions, but she was never accepted by the university, which said that even though Barker was a Christian, she was not a

{"id":3354,"ended":true,"length":750,"gen_text":"For several days, Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great amounts of rainfall to much of Jamaica. A maximum total of 37 @. @ 42 inches ( 940 mm ) was recorded in the entire island that day ( July 22 \/ 23 ). During the same period, Jamaica experienced 20 @ 38 inches ( 1360 mm ) and 20 @ 44 inches ( 1600 mm ) of heavy rainfall, respectively. The next day, on June 24, was the next day before Sunday [July 25], when a maximum total rainfall, 38@.@ 44 inches, was recorded that day ( 1230 mm ) in the entire island (July 26\/27). In addition, on July 25, the largest recorded total rainfall, 47@.@ 43 inches ( 1500 mm ), was recorded the entire island. On July 26, rainfall rates were at 20 to 25 inches ( 460 to 600 mm ) per day in parts of Jamaica.\n\nThis large amount of rainfall during the period, combined with the severe drought conditions, left Jamaica with extremely low water levels in some waterways and rivers, making it so much of the water from the rivers and creeks couldn't be used for drinking and irrigation needs. This resulted in some residents using the water from their faucets for washing, cooking and doing laundry. Also, because the water didn't have enough power, it was also turned off in some areas.\n\nThe rainfall caused the lakes to overflow their banks. On the afternoon of July 26\/27, over 6 inches (150 mm ) rain fell in two hours, over most of the island, and after three hours it had now reached 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250 mm ). It continues to increase from there until early Friday [July 31]. By Friday [July 31], after 6 inches (150 mm), 10 inches (280 mm) rain had fallen in one hour [July 31\/August 1], it is the largest amount of rain that Jamaica has ever received in one month.\n\nThe total area over which the rains fell is about 15 million hectares (56.1 million acres), which is larger than any other month in the last decade. The rainfall over these areas was over 35 times greater than average.\n\nJamaica did not have a major flood or storm during this period of time, but a few small flash floods were reported. The largest flash flood in modern history in Jamaica occurred in November 1987 and killed 25 people, which has now been commemorated every year on August 26.\n\nSome residents of Jamaica noticed the weather was going from quite hot and wet to extremely humid, which they thought was a sign of an approaching dry season. By mid-July they were beginning to see that moisture was drying up, but without the precipitation to support it. As a result, the temperatures began to drop, dropping below the 25 degree Celsius limit that is considered normal for July. This was the first recorded July temperatures, recorded at Jamaica Airport, that fell below the 20 degree Celsius (68 Fahrenheit) maximum temperature of a maximum in 1960.\n\nMany of the residents were also witnessing a shift from rain to snowfall of late. It was becoming more and more snow during the months of July and August, and the resulting conditions were not conducive for making large blocks of ice. The snow and ice began to build up in certain areas, and by the beginning of August, it had created a huge obstacle for any vehicle that ventured onto the highways.

{"id":452,"ended":true,"length":730,"gen_text":"He made his debut for Birmingham City on 3 February 2001, in a 2 \u2013 1 home victory against Norwich City. He made 17 appearances for Birmingham during the 2000 \u2013 01 season, scoring three goals in the process.\n\nHe featured in the UEFA Cup final for Bolton in 2001 and 2003, and did also play in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but never got the chance to play in the FA Cup final.\n\nHe also scored the only goal ever scored in the UEFA Champion's League tournament where he was also used as a second half substitute in four of City's final seven games. This led to him being included in the European Team of the Year for 2002.\n\nHowever, since 2007 he has been involved in the English Premier League only for Birmingham City, where he has enjoyed a steady rise in form while scoring 20 goals in 58 appearances.\n\n\"For me, it can't change who I am, it's about where I will go and, as I have said many times, the goal is to stay at City\" said the 32-year-old. \"I want to help this club become successful. City will become a big club and I hope to stay and help the club\".\n\nIn 2005 he made his debut for Wales in a 2 \u2013 2 Euro qualifier defeat by Luxembourg which was followed by an international debut against Iceland in 2007.\n\nAfter a four-year spell in the UK and an 18-month spell in Germany where he had a loan spell in Werder Bremen, he returned to the English Championship with Birmingham.\n\n\"This Club will always be a place that I will return to\".\n\n\"I have no doubt that the Manager is right and you have a team full of leaders\" he continued. \"There is a vision for the future and we've got a lot of great young players coming through, they are ready to make their mark\".\n\nIn 2009, he scored a brace over two legs against Manchester City in the UEFA Cup fourth-round with the Blues winning the first game 2 \u2013 0, losing the second game 1 \u2013 0; and, in the same season, beat Newcastle United 2 \u2013 0 in the Round of 16. In the same competition in 2011, again City were beaten 1 \u2013 0 by Birmingham. He then put his foot through the ball against QPR 3 \u2013 0 in another UEFA cup round.\n\nHe now has 20 goals in 76 appearances in the Premier League, more than any other Championship player. He is the third top scoring Championship player in the 2011\/12 season, behind only Jermain Defoe and Chris Baird, with seven apiece.\n\nAs well as scoring goals, he is often the most aggressive player in the Championship. He was always at the heart of everything that goes on at the club; and he showed that on Tuesday when he was one of the first players to pull back the shirt of a City fan in a display of class, bravery and good sportsmanship. This display of support from the players also brought him the opportunity to pose for a photo with City fans of all ages as well as a massive shout-out from the Manchester City fans as his team were coming off the pitch at the final whistle.\n\nHe spoke to LIVERPOOL FANS after his first goal in a competitive game since 2 May: \"It was an unbelievable moment, a good performance in the first 45 minutes and I thought I could possibly have got on the score-sheet myself. It was a great finish by Charlie, it was a great finish to score with. I didn't think he would give me the goal, just a really solid tackle. He did his job well\".\n\nTo see the full interview with Darren Fletcher of the Birmingham City, read the full article from Thursday's edition of the Birmingham

{"id":2089,"ended":false,"length":678,"gen_text":"The novel begins with the name of Jos\u00e9 Palacios, who, here as with the historical figure of the same name, is Bol\u00edvar's `` long @ - @ serving < unk > son''. His career began almost as early as 1804, at the turn of the 19th century, when he joined the army and served in the Mexican-Spanish War. The latter campaign saw the Spanish defeat the Mexican army and its main supporters. According to some researchers, after the defeat, the Mexican republic elected Jos\u00e9 Palacios as president, and this is where the novel begins. Juan, having been discharged from the army after being seriously wounded in the battle of Churubusco ( 1804 ), joined Jos\u00e9 on the campaign against Puebla. In 1807, the army of Puebla invaded Mexico City, and after being stopped, Jos\u00e9 Palacios was appointed governor of the province. It was in this position that Juan was married to Lucia''s older sister, Maria Teresa. In 1810, there was a serious clash between the Mexican army and Puebla's forces. Jos\u00e9 won. In 1812, Juan was given command of the remaining armies of the Mexican republic. The battle of Guadalupe Hidalgo was a crucial event that broke up the Mexican republic. On August 8, 1813, the Republic surrendered to General Hernando Cortes. In January 1814, Juan, now vice president, was exiled by the newly crowned president, Jos\u00e9 Irsalito, where the latter had planned to leave him to die. The two were later reunited and became bitter enemies. Jose, having been killed in a duel by Manuel Hidalgo II, was succeeded by his son, General Jos\u00e9 Irsalito. He was also given a title - Puebla II. This is where the novel begins. The novel is a retelling of Irsalito's life, where he had been a young man growing up in the provinces of Puebla and Guerrero. In the early 1820s, the new republic was attacked by the forces of Puebla, who began a siege of Puebla. During this, it was he who had ordered the siege. He took up command of the army that defeated the Mexican army in what was called the Puebla Massacre. For some time, Puebla II's forces advanced further and further into Mexico territory. This is where the novel begins. The novel is not a story of Irsalito, but of Jos\u00e9 Irsalito. The novel was, in fact, first published in 1852, where it gained immense popularity. Irsalito was a brilliant lieutenant, who was also a poet. However, Irsalito was also a cruel commander, a very violent person, and a bloodthirsty man, who also tried to turn his own children against him. This was the reason behind the murder, committed in the fall of 1852, of Irsalito's brother - and cousin- in-law, Francisco Irsalito by Jos\u00e9 Palacios. These are some of the reasons of Irsalito's downfall - which are recounted (in a graphic and very graphic fashion) by Jos\u00e9 Palacios in his memoirs. The most powerful figure in the novel is the general and military commander, Jos\u00e9 Palacios, although it is also revealed in the novel that a good number of the people in the novel are only pretending to be members of the army. They are also members of the military. In the last paragraph, it is even revealed that almost all the people mentioned are in fact members of the army.

{"id":4925,"ended":false,"length":766,"gen_text":"In this table, `` Guns `` refers to all cannon carried by the ship, including the maindeck guns which were taken into consideration when calculating it's rate, as well as any side armament, that are not mentioned in the main article. The other columns refer to ships of other classes. Note also that the gun displacement figures are provided for the cannon in their original casings as they are required to have the exact same proportions as the original guns of similar size so that they can be put into operation using the same propellants and barrel length. Due to the large differences in the dimensions of the original guns, some have been changed slightly to provide the ammunition necessary for the particular type of cannon. Furthermore, because there were a large number of guns fitted to a single battleship, some were not used or only used at some time and a large number were never manufactured at all. Consequently, the figures provided are the approximate figures that can be obtained when fitting together pieces of guns and ammunition carried by different battleships, as well as the barrel lengths and the size of the cannon, so some of the figures given are imprecise. Also, while in any case the ratio of the barrels for cannon of the same model were not constant, as can be seen from the figures given earlier, they can be approximated since the proportions of various barrel lengths of guns which had already been manufactured are available to help in these calculations. However, if the ratio of the barrels differs by more than 8%, those barrels are taken away from the calculation and must be given instead. The two calculations are also somewhat inconsistent in that the ratios of the barrels are for different casings and barrels of the same type are given in different table places, and as can be seen from the list on the right, there are multiple cannons of different calibers and calibers of similar construction in the ships which were used in WWI that are not included in either calculation. All that can be done to make them consistent is to take a reasonable amount of care. The table gives the number and size of guns carried when fully loaded, that is, when any gun or cannon carried by the ship was used, with its overall barrel length when fully loaded. The length of gun barrel required for the ship is then added to the size of cannon needed to fill this gun barrel and the final cannon filled size is found. This gives one rounded rounded figure for the total cannon and gun length of a given warship. This is the only way to provide a useful value for this measurement. However, there are two exceptions : it does not apply to some guns (mainly those in the turret, that were usually used earlier on ) and it is not applicable to the gun barrel of guns which were not fully assembled, that is, when a part of the turret wasn't locked in place. In the cases described there was enough time to put the parts together otherwise the total length of the gun barrel would not have been a proper length for loading, and that's why these weapons are classified as unassembled guns. The total length of the gun barrel for a cannon that has been fully assembled is of course given as the result of the two different calculations given (including the case when the cannon barrel is not fully assembled) and the final length of the cannon barrel determined from the main gun barrel length taken as a whole. This gives the total length of a gun barrel when fully assembled along with a given number of barrels. This value is used by the crew of a battleship in firing their guns to find the range where damage can be expected, when that distance is very close ; or to provide a range in which damage would not be expected, when this distance is very far away. These two exceptions are the only ones where the maximum height given was the height at which the cannon was to be fired, which doesn't seem to be very reasonable!","token_len":782,"entropy":[3.1711,7.5218,0.6314,8.9693,15.9964,2.3883,3.1009,0.0127,2.4779,13.2446,7.8176,0.3023,1.1691,2.499,1.7265,1.4324,2.8211,3.4717,11.2879,1.3079,5.7706,3.3888,6.0224,4.0097,3.8571,2.5948,1.829,7.3061,1.8395,4.0105,7.205,2.9005,0.2532,0.0086,2.6983,5.3894,2.3407,0.2605,2.7935,5.665,3.6076,1.0567,4.5126,1.3313,0.4859,3.7557,3.7188,0.3506,2.3164,4.7076,1.8097,1.9545,0.0416,4.3432,1.3745,3.4448,0.8862,1.404,3.8655,3.9878,0.2932,1.2713,4.5796,5.0343,3.0509,1.0698,5.389,1.2692,1.4538,4.6906,3.2052,2.9128,2.4699,4.1026,0.1751,4.1544,1.9129,1.5501,5.9189,1.4459,2.6915,1.5605,4.2896,1.137,4.9378,1.1156,0.7904,2.1348,1.5795,4.3995,5.0101,2.0258,5.4572,0.68,2.0809,0.7014,0.177,4.8035,1.0438,5.2773,4.8835,0.3313,0.4382,2.8518,1.5037,1.8764,5.2345,0.8171,0.5302,5.9332,0.0097,0.5976,3.5951,2.7653,0.3627,1.391,3.1392,0.2952,1.0046,2.7194,0.8721,0.8307,3.8185,4.0124,0.7275,4.2767,2.0328,1.1528,3.2128,1.8264,5.9686,4.2677,0.8482,1.1227,5.4136,2.8822,0.2525,1.1993,1.591,5.9523,0.0951,3.8758,3.8517,3.134,2.7448,2.2494,0.0793,0.0067,1.8168,4.5691,0.8823,2.2921,2.177,3.8247,0.009,0.3665,2.4332,2.6242,2.3696,2.984,4.1104,2.7361,0.8679,3.517,3.4315,2.6872,2.5549,4.5565,3.8726,0.3682,1.4265,2.4459,6.929,2.7829,0.0227,0.2882,4.4598,0.287,0.861,1.7587,2.6559,1.3554,2.3109,3.2372,2.2558,2.0413,1.9464,0.0883,1.6174,3.3045,3.7358,5.144,6.4116,0.4009,3.777,3.0401,1.8396,5.8111,0.8898,1.7972,3.2012,0.0452,2.5305,2.3296,1.3516,0.0056,1.1742,5.8939,0.3677,1.8949,3.502,4.5577,0.1366,0.341,4.0544,3.616,3.8329,6.6795,1.8379,0.2606,0.9976,2.3806,1.311,5.3083,0.039,0.001,0.3356,4.1294,0.9952,4.4448,4.8502,6.0918,1.053,0.9402,5.7235,0.4727,1.2869,4.0638,4.7971,4.473,1.6243,0.8487,0.0918,4.9593,4.1932,3.092,3.7051,0.5652,3.1396,3.7745,0.0528,0.093,0.7817,0.1906,2.4162,0.9113,7.2615,0.2712,2.5505,3.3413,0.3643,2.5458,0.0059,4.1686,0.8653,2.9825,0.5725,5.3051,4.5322,0.2178,2.9349,3.4167,6.2166,3.2972,4.5331,0.0373,3.0543,2.4587,3.4838,3.3053,5.0518,1.6587,3.9659,0.2369,0.1064,4.055,0.0435,3.5999,1.4333,3.5322,0.4754,0.6206,0.7844,3.5955,2.7977,0.3067,0.0317,5.7719,1.0779,6.1919,1.826,1.5833,4.5666,3.8318,0.4618,0.3252,0.9174,1.2394,5.584,0.1838,5.1581,5.9805,1.6747,1.769,5.6069,5.0619,1.3599,4.8816,4.1476,4.7685,2.2501,0.8243,0.8514,4.1142,0.9662,0.5084,1.1765,2.026,4.971,2.6636,5.3099,0.0023,1.8969,4.1902,1.2614,0.4336,0.0246,2.1223,1.623,1.2366,2.1913,1.6635,5.9808,5.6163,1.5995,3.1481,4.5219,3.1985,0.0713,0.0573,0.6473,0.196,5.1624,4.0896,0.3786,1.2006,0.5201,2.1201,0.7165,5.7715,4.1691,1.292,2.0867,2.0068,0.796,2.3817,2.6503,0.295,0.3805,3.6844,5.1341,2.9189,0.9317,4.5781,3.5265,1.5074,2.6013,1.4117,3.9082,1.129,4.8326,1.3315,0.5732,1.0718,0.3977,3.1219,0.4616,0.2456,5.0323,4.215,0.9175,0.0245,1.6881,2.8608,2.4036,2.259,0.7099,0.1851,0.1101,1.8578,3.3788,2.4936,3.5706,0.1539,1.9672,3.8627,1.7511,2.9683,3.1727,0.457,3.3758,3.4076,2.6178,0.0356,1.0964,0.9689,6.3352,5.4398,0.2551,1.3638,3.3312,0.2066,0.6229,1.3434,6.3663,2.7402,3.4423,1.1742,2.734,1.7916,0.4936,0.1354,1.5512,3.7546,2.0736,3.6187,3.2086,5.3632,2.4745,0.0415,4.3271,2.2896,0.0274,0.8177,1.2601,3.8071,0.2532,4.3598,1.2683,4.7937,1.2535,1.4916,3.0554,2.0153,2.7629,3.2189,0.3864,0.3814,3.9947,0.0859,3.0724,3.9481,0.9292,3.3929,3.1821,1.9608,0.3455,2.2655,0.7817,3.1413,5.5396,6.237,3.403,0.2001,4.1039,0.6872,2.7291,2.2509,6.0911,5.6009,5.8328,1.5823,0.7259,0.2613,1.7892,2.3006,3.5589,0.5052,2.2512,2.2405,1.5497,2.032,2.7323,0.0005,0.4989,2.9816,1.2666,1.6629,3.2392,1.1675,0.6985,3.4207,0.9943,4.6171,4.4008,0.4797,2.4583,3.9405,1.2639,3.5211,0.0305,3.2165,0.5446,2.2416,3.7523,7.6261,6.0282,2.9804,0.0582,3.5651,0.1409,5.2313,2.9826,2.8351,1.5584,1.4919,2.1974,2.9816,0.6999,3.5249,2.6836,3.6992,2.2456,4.7886,3.0554,6.3213,2.3763,6.2204,0.4557,0.6656,2.6377,0.7744,1.2091,0.2172,1.4645,3.6259,2.4457,1.9939,3.7001,1.4656,0.7697,1.5377,3.2419,4.6706,2.2942,1.8719,0.033,0.5076,2.5916,2.3492,4.2679,0.2068,0.1998,5.4479,6.4567,0.0069,5.9075,1.2329,0.3554,1.2893,2.5121,1.842,4.3822,4.0688,4.9176,4.5629,4.9805,2.7832,0.9051,2.6689,0.4975,2.9679,0.5085,6.8001,0.8805,3.5601,0.4768,0.3981,0.369,0.6301,0.1424,0.5429,1.6029,1.0744,0.3028,4.1024,4.2459,2.1054,2.1213,5.1202,2.6704,1.5485,4.4641,2.7145,0.4098,2.012,4.1669,0.6112,7.2857,0.2556,3.1329,1.9489,0.732,0.3484,1.6943,3.7206,0.2709,0.1209,1.0302,0.5163,0.0615,2.224,1.6268,2.8807,2.7916,2.3139,0.4503,1.1481,0.0575,0.5357,5.599,0.0466,3.0608,2.2898,0.8772,6.2453,0.1114,0.9962,3.7055,5.147,0.2417,3.5198,6.006,4.1193,0.5099,4.3175,2.3302,0.6809,1.728,2.7233,1.302,1.1858,0.3519,0.0269,1.5328,0.967,1.5386,2.8791,1.4075,0.6559,0.281,1.208,1.0525,5.1655,1.7333,0.6136,5.0398,3.5506,1.0315,0.4342,5.7634,1.7662,1.3535,1.3144,0.2622,2.5913,1.8366,1.2739,1.565,0.214,0.1163,1.7415,1.8245,0.5573,2.6324,1.2059,0.3682,6.7439,0.0189,2.4786,4.8236,2.1635,0.3656,2.1658,1.0134,2.3575,3.0678,0.6055,2.9528,2.5231,0.6393,4.6789,1.4946,1.7394,1.396,0.0072,2.8457,4.4362,2.6098,1.0236,3.4283,4.1667,0.7536,1.7361,4.9938,7.0177,2.3142,0.0611

{"id":86,"ended":false,"length":694,"gen_text":"Townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family. From home, Townsend completed his second solo ambient album, The Hummer, releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.\n\nIn October that same year, Townsend released the first of the four CD-Rs containing ambient tracks and tracks for the 2006 tour, although those were delayed for three months in April due to a failure of the CD-R drive that was used on the original CD of In the Woods. In November of the same year, the fifth and final CD-R with ambient tracks was released and it contains three new album tracks. In June 2007, The Hummer was released in physical format for the first time including all the original tracks on CD and CD\/Vinyl. In August 2007, the album was given away for free on the websites of the BBC, the Guardian and the London Evening Standard (the Guardian in UK English with the title The Life and times of John Trudnell, and the Metropolitan in US English with the title, \"John Trudnell and the Great Ocean Road\"). The album topped the digital sales charts.\n\nIn April 2008, Tame Impala released their ninth studio album, Lonerism. The disc was released on May 17 th and subsequently attained platinum status. In May 2008, The Great Ocean Road came out digitally and on vinyl, which was the band's first record to be released on vinyl. However, despite the fact that the CD\/Vinyl album had sold over four million copies worldwide the same year (the first time an album could be said as having sold more copies in a year than an album did during the previous year), and despite the fact that the album had become the band's third best-selling vinyl album, the digital editions remained unheard of. In August 2010, Tame Impala released a remix of the album 'On a Plain', which was a remake of the track 'I Write Sins Not Tragedies', originally released under the alias 'Tame Impala - I Write Sins Not Tragedies' back in 2000 with The Guardian saying that the remix is an \"exploitative take\".\n\nIn addition, in early 2011, a DVD documentary entitled 'The Love Within: John Trudell and the Great Ocean Road' was released which was a part of the DVD boxset The Life and The Times of John Trudnell, the record contained in the boxset was edited out, the documentary's final 10 minutes was included in the collection, despite the intention of Trudell taking the film with him, although he kept some of the original artwork for this disc to accompany the DVD.\n\nEarly 2016 saw Trudell release his 14th solo album, 'Lonerism', which was released on December 18 th, this included four new track from the first album (except for the song 'Nangs' on the final album, which was not included on the final album) and two covers of 'Killer Js' by The Smashing Pumpkins and 'In The Summertime' by Rufus Wainwright, he has also re-mastered 'In The Night' for the re-issue of 'In The Woods', his album was nominated for Album of The Year at the 53rd Golden Globes and a Grammy for Album of the Year and Best Pop Duo\/Group Performance ( The Pumpkins' performance was for the video game The Last of Us).

{"id":942,"ended":false,"length":776,"gen_text":"`` The Darkness `` had the desired effect ; Lineberger wrote that `` I was taken aback by the dark tone and emotional range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, but never in the genre are the elements taken as seriously as in this episode! At least ten times in this novel the characters are in desperate need of the love, light and life they receive from a supernatural being. As with many such episodes, the characters become more and more involved before they finally learn to realize the limits of their own understanding and accept what they have to do to survive. If it had been up to me I would have taken the characters to be `` from the perspective of the gods themselves!'' The main characters never learn to appreciate their own power to heal, see, or love, or that there may be more to life than the physical world, and the result is a series of episodes that have more in common with the movies than with a drama that seeks to deal with the real issues of what humanity could and should do to survive in a dark and harsh environment. It is a pity some of the key elements of this novel are discarded, or given a completely different interpretation and purpose in another novel. The darkness and the dark tones are too dramatic, and the emotion too intense to serve as a good counterbalance to the more light-hearted approach of the previous book. The way in which the characters are portrayed, is also sometimes inconsistent. Sometimes we see the demons as the heroes, sometimes we see them as tragic figures of weakness. It makes the main characters seem overly sentimental, as they are always fighting for a cause even if it is one which will only prolong and prolong the inevitable pain. If we are not going to understand and accept the problems that the characters face on a daily basis - and this I certainly believe they must, even when they try to do the right thing in the case of the demons - is it not better to leave them to their tragedies and to make them part of the real world rather than to take them into our own? There is one major weakness with The Darkness that should be mentioned, though : for the past half century the series has used the exact same basic structure. To put it gently, the structure is not as elegant as it once was. The story is not broken any more, but a whole lot of plot elements are put into a pot and some of them stew for a long time before they can be used, if at all. This is a problem of storytelling, not of plot. The problem is not the structure per se ; quite the opposite, in my opinion, because it is this precise structure which keeps the stories so rich. The problem is the fact that there are elements of this structure that simply cannot be done better any more. In the end it is always just one of these ingredients that goes wrong, and that there was enough of it on hand at the time the stewing happened. A good story is one that always works with the basic structure, but no good story will work with a stewing of ingredients from the old pot by a new man. To sum up my main criticisms for this novel : It is often inconsistent and disjointed with the rest of the books in the series ; the central story element, the idea of the power of love and faith is completely given over to the notion of the need to overcome obstacles (including the idea of demons as being a threat to a good man ) rather than deal with the actual problems facing the character as they would in a real world situation. It is too emotional and takes too much time ; some plots need to be condensed ; some elements are simply given a slightly different story for another book ; the most important idea for this story which should have been emphasized a lot is that the story was written with the central protagonist as the main character. As a result, the book becomes very

{"id":1044,"ended":false,"length":656,"gen_text":"Insular art, or Hiberno @ - @ Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo @ - @ Saxon England from the seventh century onward. Its main attribute are the thick lines of red, green and blue which give these styles their iconic and enduring character. The word Hiberno has a long and colourful history in art, as early as the fifth century BC, and is derived from the Celtic words [h]iber [b]eorgion (meaning 'to flow') and [o]reorgic (meaning 'to build').\n\nA Hiberno-Saxon Cross with two red crosses on one side and a red and black one on the other is depicted in this fresco, painted by W A D Hober, which is on display at the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh. Photo Credit: RSTL\n\nOne of the first examples of Hiberno-Saxon art from England is the famous 'Eckford Cross', which is believed to derive from the late Roman Empire, and so represents a very early form of art in England. It was created in about AD 390 and is one of the earliest images in Britain to depict Christ's Resurrection.\n\nA Fresco (paintings) from the Roman City of London, created by the Roman architect Vitruvius around AD 270.Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAfter their conversion to Christianity in the 6th and 7th centuries, those who migrated from the provinces of England and Scotland into Britain, and ultimately the whole of Britain, became known as Anglo-Saxon. By the 11th century, Hiberno-Saxon art is represented in England, and as a result, it is generally regarded as a distinct cultural group.\n\n\nThe Roman city of York is the oldest centre in the UK which was largely settled by Anglo-Saxon immigrants, where an extremely rich collection of Anglo-Saxon art remains. One of the most famous examples of Anglo-Saxon art is the famous 'Chamber of Secrets', which features gold-worked filigree work. Other famous pieces of Anglo-Saxon art include the 'Walking-Witch', where the witch walks barefoot on a green field. The witch is said to have originally been thought to be a Christian, but was rebaptized by Saxons who became her worshippers and gave her her new look.\n\nIn the city of York lies the most famous collection of Anglo-Saxon art. Located next to Chester, it is the most important museum for this kind of art in England. The most important artist is the German-born Christopher Morland who, based on his paintings, is often called the father of Anglo-Saxon art. Another important artist is Richard Lutterworth (1631-83) whose paintings show scenes from daily life, which are not known from any other period of Anglo-Saxon history. Another important artist is Edward Gibbon (1599-1679). One of the main problems of Gibbon's work, he wrote in \"the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", was that he could not explain in terms his discoveries were contemporary with the Anglo-Saxon era.\n\n\nToday, there is no real evidence for the existence of a separate culture called Anglo-Saxon in England. Although some scholars believe that such a distinct culture did exist, they point out that the evidence is quite vague. In general, scholars tend to find the term Hiberno-Saxon when talking about England.

{"id":4105,"ended":true,"length":727,"gen_text":"The first item on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. Uranium ore was readily available. Some 1 @, @ 200 short tons would be required. This would be put into the first uranium fuel rod to be made because it would heat the reactor for a period of time.\n\nThe Soviet Atomic Energy project was not a nuclear plant, but nuclear fission reactors.\n\nThe second item of the agenda was plutonium and uranium. This required about 6 tons, and each would have to be put into a smaller reactor to reduce their amounts in the total amount of nuclear fuel. The first plutonium reactor (built in 1959) had a reactor volume of one kilometer but had only 500 tons of fuel, with a plutonium burn-up of only 250 MW or about 1.5 MW.\n\nThe third item of the agenda was the fuel rods for this first reactor (built in 1960), which required the largest amount of uranium ore. These were about 80,000 to 100,000 short tons.\n\nThe second item on the agenda was the construction of a laboratory. This required the creation of about 8,000 to 10,000 space for nuclear experiments. These experiments would be run by American workers from the Manhattan Project. (There were already about 900 US scientists working at various sites around the US which had already conducted plutonium tests. Many had already moved to the Soviet Union.)\n\nThe fourth item of the agenda was the development of the first nuclear aircraft. This was a two-place winged airplane with a single engine. They would fly high enough to avoid Soviet missile defenses.\n\nThis agenda did not cover the development of large reactor design, including the three \"reactor core\" designs. The two designs - P-1 and P-2 - were a little more complex in the assembly which was done in a different plant. The third, larger reactor design - P-3 - used the same basic approach, but with the uranium fuel burning faster during the same time period and at higher temperatures with longer burn-ups. The total project time for the three designs was about 10 years; at present it was over 35 years.\n\nA few of these agenda items did not even have any nuclear material whatsoever. The Atomic Energy Commission, in a recent survey, estimated that no more than one-half of one percent of the materials needed for a nuclear power program had actually been developed.. This is a very low rate. The atomic energy program in general had not shown a high rate of progress, although the American nuclear program had a high level of technical understanding. Many of the major tasks are long overdue and they will take many years to complete.\n\nThis is not the picture presented by the US government today. We know today all of these long-overdue tasks have been done and are under way, and the nuclear program has been transformed into a powerful weapon of mass destruction. The American media does a little telling but no explaining - and there are a few brave voices who are trying to speak out but are attacked viciously..\n\nThis is perhaps also true in Iran - although I am sure many of the people there know as much as we do - and most of the current problems would be much worse in Iran than in the United States\n\nSome of the problems would be even worse -- although the Iranians also don't know as much as we do -- because the Iranian people are very poor. Many of them don't even have heat and air conditioning. (The only modern form of air conditioning that could even be used would be too dangerous to do in Iran.) As a result most of the problems are not problems for the average Persian but an elite.\n\nOne is left to wonder why the Iranian people are being ignored in the great American media campaign to deceive the world about Iran.","token_len":783,"entropy":[4.145,6.2407,1.663,0.5375,0.9917,1.1226,1.8471,4.4102,11.8056,2.3218,0.892,3.4206,1.8782,2.3489,7.6734,0.8969,0.0545,0.0338,0.0,0.001,2.2121,5.4942,0.7876,0.1969,1.9655,5.7444,0.0015,3.0657,1.0715,5.6229,0.0758,3.9583,5.4761,5.475,15.6952,5.7104,5.7247,7.4677,9.6201,0.019,3.6198,0.7388,1.378,1.0692,3.4365,2.2558,1.1468,5.7825,1.632,1.5462,3.4072,4.0865,3.5221,1.5225,3.2526,0.1772,2.5025,7.337,1.2635,1.2262,6.0013,0.9865,0.4929,4.0828,1.5068,3.4526,0.3783,0.3073,1.2815,2.0564,0.0093,1.2649,6.0111,4.3397,0.0371,6.49,1.0371,3.2389,2.481,3.3994,4.1286,1.5479,0.6104,6.1403,4.1212,0.0047,1.4654,0.5737,3.4132,0.0002,1.2891,1.9544,0.0683,3.8813,0.3851,0.1725,0.1017,5.0497,3.8884,1.4359,1.6198,3.0563,4.5924,3.3215,4.0071,2.7599,3.4129,2.3961,5.6801,2.3224,2.3432,0.1701,0.0466,3.713,0.197,1.0532,6.1017,2.1255,1.9199,3.8922,2.5658,6.4174,2.8871,0.2925,4.2104,2.0137,0.4737,3.9583,0.492,0.8379,1.9811,2.7413,1.9008,2.4369,4.6268,5.2823,0.7781,3.8345,0.2412,1.7803,0.8228,4.1354,4.1229,0.0613,5.4172,5.7497,0.0755,5.5157,2.3011,2.1647,4.9971,2.6927,0.0928,1.1104,2.1184,4.205,1.5751,4.4906,5.2189,1.2539,0.0112,0.1431,2.5361,4.8194,4.1293,5.1291,2.4465,2.1421,2.0096,0.7392,2.4691,0.9108,1.3708,0.0002,0.6614,0.9892,0.0602,1.281,0.0115,0.0212,0.0871,2.0255,4.0515,1.6309,1.5734,3.1918,2.0333,0.4803,3.9074,2.7402,0.0966,1.1314,2.3076,1.1786,2.7996,3.5136,3.5163,0.5231,0.1817,0.6065,1.7982,1.7001,3.2092,1.4926,2.6551,4.8331,1.5119,0.0276,3.3981,0.9593,0.0039,0.0037,1.1837,0.0032,1.0035,1.4868,0.0002,0.6007,3.7873,1.3006,1.1678,0.0211,0.0156,0.1546,0.9716,3.5793,0.0328,0.9486,5.6956,3.1155,1.3229,2.4985,1.5431,4.426,0.0233,2.9714,4.2401,0.8803,0.1187,1.6488,0.5151,0.0016,0.0031,5.2516,1.7676,4.6115,1.6872,0.6704,3.3933,1.194,1.3107,0.9783,4.2978,1.0009,4.9414,4.3037,3.9189,0.7597,3.8265,0.1708,0.8283,4.6939,3.8858,0.676,3.6102,1.623,5.8282,4.0699,1.8227,0.8092,1.2565,5.4456,2.385,2.7899,0.0433,2.6278,5.9372,2.2843,3.5404,4.2366,4.2163,2.7796,2.2201,3.6629,3.2751,1.6585,3.9239,0.4765,1.05,2.3664,0.0371,1.2318,0.4274,0.0002,0.4522,1.8484,0.0486,1.1066,0.004,0.0067,0.0825,0.6952,2.8119,0.0412,1.6451,1.4662,1.541,5.3091,0.6776,0.6625,1.3377,1.8805,4.6059,0.3297,5.5219,5.4571,0.6292,2.8383,1.7405,0.7717,3.081,1.2835,0.9349,5.0526,1.8649,2.2601,4.6728,1.2258,0.3629,2.0452,3.6887,4.6097,1.0134,0.5766,1.1749,0.0002,4.2622,3.2287,3.6892,0.0546,4.2161,0.7168,2.1724,0.0319,6.0309,5.2567,5.2475,1.3763,5.0129,0.7886,5.3935,4.8455,5.5071,0.0114,4.9473,0.2176,0.3322,1.7004,1.9281,4.3458,4.6308,6.73,5.5196,2.0171,0.8762,0.4778,0.3358,0.0096,0.09,0.1684,0.7171,4.9972,3.5188,1.5731,1.4758,3.3971,2.6593,4.9183,6.7009,2.0037,2.3508,0.8931,1.5824,4.5169,2.9845,0.9654,1.277,2.4613,2.7272,2.675,0.5556,1.5176,1.1712,1.4667,0.0066,0.2294,0.244,3.5864,2.205,0.6285,2.2932,4.7724,2.2515,0.4536,2.2817,2.3562,3.4449,1.4588,6.1674,3.9301,6.6787,0.5193,5.0883,1.255,1.0485,3.2569,4.11,2.5643,0.67,5.5737,5.2543,1.6361,0.4779,2.2542,0.1661,1.8311,5.1204,4.3652,2.8614,1.5153,1.3288,0.6662,1.5526,0.2721,0.8249,2.7971,0.1611,5.6742,5.3324,4.5182,2.572,3.8642,4.1018,4.1681,0.0597,0.2437,0.5297,0.0002,3.9641,3.3183,2.2399,2.3457,3.9896,0.0173,3.5575,0.8319,3.6675,3.1498,3.249,2.3275,2.352,5.1865,0.5413,1.3501,5.3799,0.0067,0.4872,3.6718,2.5142,2.4624,5.6202,3.654,0.7782,1.954,0.2693,5.3961,0.9199,0.012,3.2534,1.0132,1.5958,0.2258,1.2757,0.0756,0.0806,0.2903,3.3488,1.9093,0.4061,2.8048,1.1669,2.2909,3.1894,1.5205,1.5589,0.0506,2.381,8.9734,3.1425,1.9255,1.8165,1.5646,1.5396,1.8948,1.8465,2.3581,3.9453,1.1801,0.6589,3.2472,3.5795,2.0812,2.9767,5.5613,2.4102,1.5684,0.3504,0.0201,1.5263,2.24,3.3302,1.6625,5.4606,3.1812,1.6093,0.982,2.8164,2.0517,3.9292,0.049,2.392,5.2616,0.7397,5.3391,0.918,0.1674,4.6667,4.717,5.8563,5.6188,1.626,1.7749,5.7041,2.1639,2.0411,1.4219,0.6273,0.4306,0.4782,0.2142,0.6291,0.0002,4.0118,1.912,1.5684,2.3418,6.1912,2.59,0.5768,0.6472,3.8129,1.7148,2.9129,0.376,4.6697,3.6898,3.8198,7.2665,1.7055,1.8148,6.0043,0.6983,1.5664,0.003,0.8784,1.7603,0.2488,2.3001,2.151,1.7186,3.8127,0.3084,2.2942,1.2419,1.7719,3.4499,1.8647,1.8468,1.6133,3.8316,1.0293,0.3763,3.4981,2.4749,1.7496,0.9037,0.0055,0.448,2.177,3.411,4.3864,3.1563,3.7948,5.8024,4.8782,2.9912,3.966,3.212,4.8002,2.6009,4.1689,1.481,3.1981,1.2499,5.2967,2.8819,2.2123,1.95,0.9966,0.2083,3.5785,0.6524,3.3429,1.1289,4.797,4.0832,0.0001,7.3389,0.4752,0.0002,3.4593,1.0763,6.4439,5.7236,3.7063,2.273,5.7513,3.1525,2.4234,3.3138,1.8515,3.1725,4.2742,2.1019,0.5266,2.632,1.4096,2.1239,5.1799,0.327,1.4112,1.8346,0.2132,3.8253,1.1697,5.6441,0.6786,0.7085,6.0414,3.6764,4.7,1.5018,2.2571,1.5967,1.695,0.2406,1.2754,0.3223,0.1219,1.2278,0.0029,5.7902,0.0002,4.9667,1.3727,0.2597,2.7536,2.7803,0.5207,2.8133,0.2475,7.8635,4.9302,2.0606,2.6428,4.0263,5.1488,0.0025,1.1344,0.9065,0.0144,0.6832,0.0601,0.0404,1.3346,2.8216,1.1737,1.5198,1.681,1.2457,3.2686,2.1825,1.5052,3.8756,0.6661,1.3424,3.4788,0.0008,1.0058,0.33,5.8961,2.0461,1.4762,0.3912,0.7856,4.6735,2.0899,4.5678,4.5244,4.8295,0.0109,

{"id":744,"ended":false,"length":707,"gen_text":"In November 1947, Lawton was sold to Notts County of the Third Division South for a British record transfer fee of \u00a3 20 @, @ 000. He made the surprise decision to retire after three matches in which he played just eight minutes, only to be sent to his home in England with half his wages. Lawton never played for the 'old brigade' again, despite a contract offer from the new West Midlands-based West County.\n\nThere were no great regrets and when the war ended he returned to the club where he made four league appearances for the newly promoted Second Division North. He made another five appearances for West County in 1946-47, which included one in every game including their run to promotion on 9th October 1947. He returned to Middlesbrough twice, scoring in his first match against Luton on 6th May, and then being withdrawn in the dying seconds of the 6th May match against Barnet after a knee injury during the first half. However, despite being fit for the game, there was no chance of Lawton returning to the first team so he signed with Oxford United of the Football League. He played for them once more in 1948-49 and for Nottingham Forest on one occasion, however he didn't enjoy his time in County League football very much. He played just one more Championship game for Forest in 1949-50 which was the match against Leicester City, scoring in the 2nd minute. At the end of the 1949-50 Football League season he moved on to Birmingham where the same Nottingham Forest team in 1948-49. The two clubs would play each other three times in the 1950-51 and 1951-52 seasons and he scored in five of those matches, including a match winning goal against the Tigers in the first leg on 7th January 1951 in what I feel is an important game in a season which featured a very long season in both divisions.\n\nHe is the only footballer to have scored a goal for different clubs in the same year, however, I'm sure somebody will be able to come up with one for him with the addition of the East Anglian clubs for which he played.\n\nLawton had an unspectacular managerial career at Middlesbrough, taking charge of Middlesbrough's first ever match with Middlesbrough FC aged just 28 years old, on 5th July 1951. The day included a 2-0 home win over Oldham Athletic and the club playing a first ever tie against Birmingham City \u2013 an important match to many Boro fans in that it marked the club's first appearance in the first division. Boro went on to lose this match to Birmingham 1-0 and then went on a great run of 16 weeks which included a famous 2-1 away win at Old Trafford to kick off the season. However, after the mid March victory over West Ham, Lawton moved to Oxford United in the early parts of the 1952-53 season. A disastrous first season was concluded with victoryless draws against Newcastle United and Manchester United - a game in which Lawton scored. Lawton's management career came to a very rapid end when he was sacked for gross misconduct in March 1954, for which he was later given a 12 match ban. It was a remarkable story which is well worth listening to \u2013 it also comes from Michael Latham's book \u2013 'The Boro Story'.\n\nThe following season Lawton left to join Nottingham Forest for whom he managed seven games before retiring in 1956. He retired aged 51 years old.\n\nLawton is also famous for scoring the only goal in the Football League against Coventry City to win the first ever Football League Football Cup for Forest \u2013 he

{"id":4182,"ended":true,"length":742,"gen_text":"Forbes Field had an original capacity of 25 @, @ 000, the largest in the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,068 in the year 2000. Seating levels at home games dropped precipitously in the second half of the 2000s, and has never been recovered to the levels of the early 1990s. As early as 2004, Forbes Field had lost more than $ 5 mln and had a capacity of just over 16,000. Its main tenants were the Kansas Jayhawks and the University of North Texas Cowboys, both of which have since left the city with the largest crowds in the nation to this day. While KU and UNT are major powerhouses in our state, neither the University of North Texas nor its football program has shown much promise to the rest of the Big 12, and both schools have failed to gain the attention and national recognition that Forbes Field enjoys.\nThe venue and history are what makes Forbes Field, and there is so much more about the stadium. It has seen so many different iterations, yet it has never stopped producing incredible football memories. The stadium features four of the most famous sound walls in college sports, with one of them boasting a 2,000-year lifespan (now a living statue in the upper deck ). When the stadium was first built (late 1900s), it had 3,000 seated seats, but expansion was needed. The original football and baseball stadium, home of the Dallas Cougars and Texas Longhorns, suffered an earthquake in 1904, as did many other parts of the city. The stadium remained closed for over a year and was declared \"uninhabitable\".\nAfter World War 1 ended and the Great Depression took its toll on our industry, the field was finally renovated with an expansion and a new retractable roof in the 1940s. Unfortunately, that didn't work out very well. The field was never able to fully recover fully from those severe economic conditions (during the war), and it only lost about 60% of its capacity with the addition of the new roof, but that was still nearly half of its original capacity. Then, in 1980, the stadium underwent a major renovation when the original roof completely collapsed, reducing its capacity to 8,000. In 1987, as part of the original renovation, the entire seating capacity was reduced to 4,500 and the field was removed. It was immediately demolished, with the stadium's final fate unknown.\nThe following year, Forbes Field saw a new design, taking inspiration from the old, but modern. The new design featured high level seating in the upper deck. The seating was redesigned and upgraded, including higher grade metal seating that was more durable and longer-lasting. In 1993, the field again underwent a complete renovation, adding a retractable roof. In 1995, the stadium was demolished under heavy opposition from the nearby city of Richardson (as it stood was within the city limits), before being rebuilt with new seating that was about 10 rows better than its original incarnation. While the roof was installed by 1995, no game was ever held in the new stadium until it was removed in 2013 for football and basketball events. (With its new seating, the seating capacity was now 17,542.)\nSince 1990, it has been on the list for several teams to purchase the old stadium and redevelop it to fit their needs, but with the current state of our economy in the Big 12, those efforts have been largely unsuccessful as they could not find a takers. With the stadium gone, the last games at Forbes Field were played in September, 2007, when the college baseball team played its home games there.\nToday, Forbes Field sits on the far west side of campus surrounded by parking lots, with the stadium once owned by the city of Richardson still in its original state, except it sits empty.","token_len":784,"entropy":[8.4005,9.1452,7.4915,3.7703,5.8599,1.38,0.0261,4.455,16.3858,5.9874,8.5395,11.2561,1.9738,5.8277,4.4054,2.5967,0.5456,2.0452,1.9794,0.4151,0.0095,0.587,8.1296,0.5852,4.7451,0.8827,2.0618,0.7267,10.9616,0.0377,8.3926,0.0051,1.8522,7.4857,0.0627,0.4557,2.5965,0.3777,0.0207,3.9989,0.0496,5.254,2.3717,0.889,2.1774,4.9393,1.4183,0.3415,4.6522,0.1039,5.0607,2.024,4.7268,0.1587,5.5099,4.2556,0.0009,0.0055,1.6152,0.3914,4.1243,0.1049,0.0231,0.1434,1.2542,0.4575,0.701,1.9734,4.7595,2.3419,2.1013,2.757,1.9872,1.2981,2.5507,0.724,0.4866,1.4144,1.8497,0.0267,0.2026,4.4103,5.1905,0.0079,3.4343,0.1586,2.0402,0.0043,1.5862,4.3083,2.3853,0.0939,3.3586,8.0614,6.0626,0.4477,3.7071,1.9298,2.1256,2.7707,0.0934,2.8319,2.1051,3.5748,0.1729,0.1215,0.4354,5.629,5.3303,3.2105,0.9623,0.4893,4.4447,3.0138,0.0253,1.2332,0.7355,1.2159,0.0035,5.2387,1.319,3.9405,1.4136,1.2868,0.7689,0.4715,2.1225,0.8787,1.592,0.9614,2.6581,5.7973,1.5574,5.6869,4.8968,1.1445,0.87,3.5102,3.5421,4.0262,0.2291,0.1712,5.7905,6.0382,0.0437,1.5996,0.3721,0.011,2.0383,4.532,3.1885,0.059,0.6643,7.0292,1.4629,0.2191,3.4831,4.9682,2.8246,0.5381,1.5948,0.0131,0.3165,2.6256,1.8522,1.0782,1.0444,5.3219,1.2131,2.0278,3.5121,2.2955,2.4332,0.0022,0.1949,3.0292,0.1301,2.3223,1.1423,2.7502,1.6621,0.8233,4.0301,0.0736,3.8084,3.102,1.944,2.9585,4.0164,1.5672,1.0856,3.5206,0.0454,4.4606,0.3101,1.0933,5.5914,5.1308,5.1252,6.3541,3.0106,3.923,2.0112,0.512,0.0333,4.7257,1.1947,5.2806,0.7919,5.3293,0.0278,0.6332,4.6837,0.7097,1.051,3.2524,2.6092,2.0026,4.4515,3.9458,0.5914,2.1452,3.4417,1.4001,3.8646,1.792,1.4168,1.7997,4.6376,5.0271,4.9581,2.1717,3.8202,0.5017,2.2229,1.951,4.7871,4.1035,5.2435,0.1158,1.5938,1.8819,5.0387,4.5223,0.0959,0.9361,3.1202,0.8621,3.194,3.5024,0.5012,1.363,4.9593,1.492,5.5033,0.5982,0.8764,1.1911,1.7447,3.9182,4.0295,5.4674,2.8085,5.9112,3.3135,3.0695,0.3427,3.6351,1.201,6.8257,5.0996,1.1123,1.6601,0.7429,2.2425,0.4974,4.4464,5.9173,4.8034,0.2051,0.2994,1.077,2.2833,5.9739,0.8169,0.7995,5.1528,1.9047,1.1954,1.6056,5.2923,2.7559,1.804,2.4393,1.4345,2.362,6.1162,4.6889,1.2236,2.2083,2.6451,4.9342,0.6104,0.2097,2.7736,6.3472,0.0036,1.7079,1.8159,1.3257,0.0218,0.3377,6.3118,3.7508,1.7518,0.4919,3.8307,1.0571,5.8517,0.5381,3.7457,0.806,3.8327,0.0044,0.4867,0.6615,0.4694,1.3616,1.8657,4.6953,3.2004,0.483,3.0384,0.6396,0.6077,1.9522,1.1329,5.6179,2.6708,0.5226,0.0008,0.0034,1.4637,3.0018,3.528,5.1852,0.0036,4.3704,2.9604,2.5078,0.6967,3.4488,0.0152,3.2915,1.8748,0.0524,0.862,5.1866,5.257,0.1325,0.9202,5.2541,0.5718,4.3511,2.0457,3.6302,3.0845,3.5578,3.0564,1.7727,0.9417,3.7533,0.0077,0.0603,1.3504,1.796,2.5376,0.0445,0.2468,5.7204,0.1831,3.9082,3.7014,0.0009,3.0138,0.1661,3.849,0.0087,1.3567,1.0949,3.3928,0.8393,3.6458,2.5981,0.0057,2.3301,0.3365,7.7315,0.4803,4.6934,4.8085,5.154,1.839,4.1587,5.3389,0.5393,4.4929,3.1175,0.3825,1.9701,3.8848,4.7209,1.2624,4.9916,0.4064,0.0534,0.13,0.5362,5.2579,0.6281,2.1943,0.0441,1.1536,2.6702,0.9413,2.9464,2.655,2.4749,1.6672,1.3245,4.6183,2.5946,0.5946,0.7689,0.5271,0.1314,0.2777,5.2877,1.2001,0.6174,5.5095,0.1213,0.8858,1.5035,2.0128,0.7221,1.7962,0.4552,3.9901,1.0398,2.3761,1.397,6.7402,0.6374,1.6135,5.6599,2.8966,0.1968,0.4931,4.6793,0.026,0.6604,0.583,3.106,3.2603,0.0978,5.7928,1.142,0.0022,0.9142,4.2748,2.0544,0.2243,0.6535,3.5363,3.8122,2.0803,0.3149,0.9961,0.3269,2.3756,0.012,1.187,2.7246,0.8241,1.9965,0.2962,4.8062,1.4884,2.5194,0.5934,5.4205,3.3865,1.698,2.8146,0.6869,2.5671,1.7629,5.331,5.1891,1.5377,0.8088,0.7904,1.8349,5.1191,1.0349,0.137,2.7644,0.0145,3.985,1.4014,1.8909,5.7473,1.6246,5.938,2.337,0.0214,0.5661,3.0584,5.6172,1.6819,3.3612,2.4844,0.8988,1.7853,1.3782,1.659,6.1261,5.4601,1.6196,2.8387,0.4875,0.993,0.3395,3.1045,1.1522,2.9511,1.4063,5.4308,2.2924,4.2055,1.2126,2.883,5.8152,5.8126,5.1747,2.8353,3.102,1.0066,2.1683,1.4047,0.9377,5.6969,1.6017,0.0348,0.4693,3.0123,3.2654,0.0528,0.741,2.238,4.1938,0.6704,0.2994,2.5134,0.4416,0.742,3.1127,1.231,1.373,0.0054,0.0558,1.7891,3.1989,2.38,0.0495,0.712,1.4698,1.1347,3.3069,6.1352,4.7912,4.8585,0.5992,1.0021,4.1469,2.3542,0.2792,1.6905,3.4126,4.349,2.042,4.8203,4.1335,4.4732,1.2711,0.3669,0.4017,1.2388,6.1968,0.6558,1.5782,2.6606,2.5356,0.7774,3.9633,1.1002,5.1979,3.156,4.6244,5.8755,0.7584,2.7599,1.0467,3.8676,0.1413,5.4014,0.8745,4.8172,0.9117,4.2035,5.3172,3.8505,0.0592,5.756,3.636,0.7259,0.8073,4.5028,2.0899,0.3802,1.3239,0.5858,2.5391,3.4572,0.61,4.5804,0.7821,4.9711,2.4851,5.741,2.7378,1.4954,2.9358,0.2118,5.9881,5.3024,3.8086,1.6082,2.2829,0.6362,0.685,3.7159,0.1644,1.5461,3.2717,3.8898,0.0035,4.9303,2.435,1.2579,0.5914,3.5065,6.5058,0.05,4.2583,0.2184,0.7174,5.8615,0.8683,2.6976,3.9419,3.7186,5.5388,0.4203,3.7379,0.8427,3.6575,0.4793,1.7931,4.0979,0.143,3.8092,4.1747,0.11,0.2237,1.4182,0.6051,4.2488,1.7864,3.3049,2.2096,0.0113,2.7632,1.1678,4.6903,1.1077,3.5592,0.0375,0.1862,3.4097,2.2989,0.4588,1.0999,3.0552,0.302,5.5276,4.4063,4.2338,0.2646,1.9804,0.6574,5.3037,0.754,0.7749,3.2126,0.8208,2.4748,3.9215,0.3659,0.9999,5

{"id":1063,"ended":true,"length":728,"gen_text":"Bell was considered in February 1999 to be the front @ - @ runner in the mayoral race. Other potential candidates included State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy, former City Councilman Carl Stokes, and City Councilman Charles Hillmeyer Jr.\n\n\nIt was alleged that Bell worked for a company called GEO Group from 1996-1999 and was the owner of the Atlanta Braves' radio station WBAL-FM until early 1997. The company is now called SiriusXM. In February 1999, Bell was the star attraction at an event celebrating the opening of Turner Field where he spoke at length about how he has overcome his personal hardships to become the first elected black mayor of Atlanta. A year later he was the subject of a CBS 60 Minutes profile for speaking out against \"inflation with a smile\". Bell's comments against inflation have long been interpreted by some as racist, although Bell emphatically stated in the 60 Minutes interview that he was not referring to an inflationist.\n\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission revoked Bell's license to operate the Braves' radio station in April 1999 following an investigation into possible discrimination based on Bell's race. Bell denied any alleged discrimination. In response, Bell said he would seek to regain his license.\n\n\nIn September 1999 Bell was criticized for refusing to attend the City County Black Caucus at the Atlanta City Hall where the NAACP leadership held the first ever meeting of its kind for public officials in Georgia. He said he would send a private plane to fly him there, but then sent a business jet instead.\n\n\nAt a March 2004 press conference in his Atlanta-area campaign headquarters, as thousands watched from the gallery, Bell announced he was running for mayor.\n\n\nHis first official act as an elected official in Atlanta was to place a temporary moratorium on a controversial private company's plan to build a new downtown highrise tower on city-owned Ponce de Leon Avenue, a development opposed by some local blacks. The moratorium lasted only two days before being lifted. At a 2005 press conference on another issue - a controversial proposal to convert two of the city's best-known parks into luxury condominiums - Bell's public demeanor was much more pleasant.\n\n\nIn late 2005, Bell signed a $1.2 billion tax extension for the Atlanta Falcons. This gave the team a $1 billion increase in its annual revenue, giving them more money to spend in the community.\n\n\nIn February 2008, the City Council approved new regulations that would make it easier for the Braves to move to Cobb County to be closer to Disney World. The team had been offered a new stadium in Georgia, but chose to stay in downtown Atlanta, despite its proximity to Disney World. Bell and then-Mayor Shirley Franklin opposed the moves, which were opposed by city officials, the Georgia State Senate, the Georgia House of Representatives, Atlanta Atlanta Urban League, and the National Association of African-American Journalists.\n\n\nHe was re-elected mayor in Atlanta in 2008. A report released by the Atlanta Journal Constitution indicated the city was on pace to exceed $3 billion in public revenues in 2010. The city's budget was under pressure due to a 2008 property tax increase that will cost city-wide taxpayers roughly $500 million per year for the next two decades. The Atlanta Journal Constitution report noted most of the changes to the city's budget in recent years are from the loss of federal housing assistance.\n\n\nIn August 2008, Bell met with President Barack Obama in New York City when the president traveled to the city following the G8 Summit. Bell's support for Obama, who also met with Bell, suggested that the mayor has political ties to either candidate to come to Atlanta in 2016.\n\n\nBell has been on the ballot for mayor since July 2004. He has never previously run in the mayor's race.\n\n\nMayor Bell's son, Austin Bell, was elected to the Fulton County Board of Commissioners in October 2010.","token_len":784,"entropy":[5.018,7.0778,5.5095,6.7543,7.2632,0.9207,0.1692,1.0819,3.0094,17.8996,6.6271,5.8342,8.4115,2.1354,0.6228,8.073,0.3149,0.9322,7.1216,3.8443,0.3953,1.1038,6.9615,5.6889,0.0125,5.1217,6.5033,0.0254,0.5479,1.8225,2.4788,0.5092,0.8775,5.0792,1.8905,0.0278,0.3937,1.0472,3.1563,0.8184,0.7653,4.1018,5.7557,5.7748,4.9685,0.275,3.5444,0.0003,5.3354,0.7429,5.6631,0.4389,0.8679,4.6783,2.116,2.0006,2.8193,0.7345,5.4509,3.6469,0.591,4.0,2.6361,1.5582,1.2595,2.5591,1.8697,3.0727,2.4607,0.1923,1.9492,5.9867,3.1995,2.5676,3.7991,1.2971,3.5255,4.5077,1.1424,1.3436,4.986,5.0318,4.5129,0.2371,2.5652,1.9386,2.7545,1.7327,1.5942,3.5424,1.105,0.4986,3.5717,3.4701,0.5398,0.3724,0.7231,1.0047,3.3813,5.558,2.5606,0.4555,2.5634,1.6608,3.8247,0.5347,1.7169,0.0129,5.9318,0.0063,5.4111,0.3157,3.2794,2.1395,0.8958,0.2248,2.7809,1.2113,4.6378,4.8817,1.8429,2.7224,3.2966,1.6101,0.7697,1.8624,2.5295,5.0867,1.0583,0.0831,0.2476,0.1436,0.2105,4.866,2.7667,0.2227,2.7439,0.9247,2.6404,1.8855,0.0047,0.5819,3.8462,3.1553,0.0234,3.5182,5.14,6.0173,0.9385,0.778,4.3377,5.4924,5.1302,7.3148,2.0819,1.9653,2.6267,1.9217,2.6034,4.1423,4.8574,0.7822,4.0371,5.5992,0.1446,5.46,1.9313,1.6142,0.3911,2.2626,2.0414,2.6963,1.1318,6.3565,2.7983,1.9261,1.4056,1.9234,0.0249,0.8444,0.122,0.4219,1.0777,0.7754,1.8549,0.026,5.5631,2.7022,4.6279,2.2588,0.8889,0.0003,3.2926,6.2574,1.1624,0.0143,5.4443,0.44,0.0086,0.4517,0.9574,0.5913,1.3393,1.3465,0.4758,0.2254,0.0467,0.6743,2.5584,0.7303,4.4913,2.1689,0.2589,0.723,3.2414,3.9625,4.0712,0.0624,3.0848,0.0125,1.1179,0.3635,0.8629,4.3006,1.4811,6.3642,0.5539,1.5013,2.098,4.166,1.1396,0.5545,3.5139,1.3565,1.0212,3.6281,1.8143,2.0151,0.2321,0.1774,1.0935,1.3807,0.0003,1.1718,3.027,0.3473,1.7864,1.4331,5.1909,0.837,4.3596,0.0763,2.9931,1.8483,4.2095,7.5505,5.3223,0.6875,3.5117,0.7331,1.7165,1.1407,0.2417,4.1791,2.444,3.257,6.3635,5.033,2.965,1.3009,3.3175,1.1111,0.8641,0.7377,0.2857,3.5963,5.1839,0.3574,1.6276,2.2844,0.1651,2.9952,1.7847,0.5021,1.5984,6.013,0.9942,2.9563,0.6602,0.4444,2.2342,0.6415,3.1298,2.1959,0.7844,2.7134,5.1618,0.9098,5.6483,0.8464,0.2937,0.2363,1.2931,0.0003,4.2314,1.133,3.7587,4.9088,1.9644,0.0094,2.6608,3.15,3.5202,4.7245,0.3824,3.561,0.4468,0.2128,6.9118,5.6744,4.1935,2.0904,0.8437,3.763,0.2904,0.1998,2.5826,1.1218,1.1595,1.1918,0.0752,0.5448,0.9712,1.9349,0.0003,4.6382,2.5531,2.9666,1.6313,0.3842,5.979,1.0593,0.0756,3.9298,1.09,0.1279,0.3699,5.4634,0.9984,3.5388,0.922,0.0277,3.4136,1.9011,5.5417,4.0585,0.8349,1.634,0.0445,0.6867,0.3223,2.0804,4.275,4.6879,2.6791,2.6497,2.8236,4.6933,0.3378,0.0046,8.2377,0.2815,0.1814,0.004,0.0496,2.1815,2.2365,3.9276,4.4202,0.0211,2.5446,2.8011,3.8097,0.5741,1.7821,0.7816,3.1862,1.7827,2.3913,0.7559,2.0911,2.4537,0.6619,0.7358,4.3504,1.5111,5.8032,1.2978,0.0105,4.0675,4.4625,2.1711,4.2329,2.2414,3.0883,2.9456,0.3687,4.1529,3.7924,3.4208,0.5795,0.1715,0.0468,5.5034,0.753,0.3104,1.711,0.4413,3.6553,1.9187,0.0004,0.1537,0.1555,0.3013,5.1092,5.1155,3.3474,1.5335,3.1314,0.7672,5.1313,0.7292,0.8039,0.0003,1.4759,4.1665,1.4354,0.687,0.7791,4.3455,0.7499,2.2986,2.3708,0.325,1.976,0.732,4.0792,4.9068,1.1536,0.8351,0.9344,0.891,2.0337,3.4735,4.9288,0.6893,0.4571,1.4904,1.9313,2.3814,1.6308,3.9957,0.1988,2.5626,1.8558,1.1145,1.5914,3.7741,2.2226,2.6789,1.2096,0.6197,0.6173,2.1868,0.382,4.0775,0.6967,1.1076,0.0003,1.0644,2.8362,2.7715,0.4784,2.3238,2.6285,0.7045,1.7187,4.8817,2.6694,1.4457,1.0605,3.1958,0.3505,1.0245,0.2305,2.0357,3.812,0.2776,1.1997,0.8328,0.4903,0.0052,4.8241,2.0809,0.4546,0.0026,7.3851,0.3381,0.6478,1.4503,2.3656,2.3237,1.5858,5.3357,0.6966,1.3273,0.1891,0.5239,4.3665,2.0203,0.1431,3.6266,0.4692,0.822,0.1547,4.5231,0.0215,2.185,4.1064,3.4201,3.9068,0.0108,1.8105,0.1331,0.4035,3.4995,3.3518,4.0297,0.1707,1.0399,0.1784,0.0014,3.1451,0.1984,6.222,1.0484,2.9073,1.6872,2.0693,0.0348,4.848,1.459,1.7432,2.1548,1.9581,1.3562,1.8698,0.456,2.0331,1.3687,0.6823,0.4776,0.0004,0.1994,4.3694,6.8525,4.5994,0.0625,0.7437,0.8527,1.3005,4.642,0.7181,0.2731,3.831,0.3541,0.1227,1.3662,0.187,0.7356,0.0003,4.1308,1.1975,1.831,0.2476,0.0045,1.7692,0.6272,5.2374,0.766,1.3045,1.7749,4.9735,5.6897,2.1241,0.9841,0.43,0.9509,1.0785,1.2309,4.4238,3.6681,1.7519,2.3112,2.7254,1.4778,0.2187,2.952,2.2474,3.345,0.3501,0.0709,3.889,4.7801,1.6882,1.9543,0.6648,2.4632,1.2558,1.2831,3.3393,1.6174,4.2905,1.8541,1.8859,0.0572,1.8606,5.3684,3.3841,0.0541,0.5361,2.1387,4.1293,1.3384,4.3005,4.3218,1.5125,1.1184,4.7939,0.0264,3.4724,0.0862,3.6873,0.0084,2.8571,0.4253,0.054,2.6948,1.078,0.1489,2.1485,2.6929,1.2079,0.0887,2.9608,2.6757,7.4227,0.216,0.3078,6.3842,1.802,0.3546,0.5455,0.3975,0.8395,3.5962,2.7505,0.0429,3.45,4.3454,2.0292,5.6075,0.0195,1.5533,4.2504,2.8643,1.9245,0.6108,0.0003,1.1143,3.2989,1.2922,0.265,0.7317,5.0317,0.2121,2.0977,1.1042,0.0027,1.8813,4.5961,0.0764,0.8983,5.7401,0.6978,1.2421,3.4726,0.1423,1.6138,0.8261,4.6905,0.4107,5.6604,0.5407,0.9493,0.3654,2.0929,2.8349,4.7167,0.7769,1.2255,3.244,1.5454,4.6418,3.2009,0.1693,2.6915,1.8144,5.8745,1.4088,0

{"id":1482,"ended":true,"length":733,"gen_text":"When access to digital computers became possible in the middle fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could, in turn, be manipulated by numbers.\n\n\nIt took the work of Robert J. Babbitt, then a student at Harvard and later the director of the MIT Computer Laboratory, to make this connection concrete. In 1956, he created the first electronic computer program \u2014 a program that could be fed a given set of numbers and produce a computer algorithm, or program \u2014 that was independent of numerical input. In his paper on this, entitled \" The Algorithmic Language Turing \", Babbitt explains that if you have a formula or a set of rules that says that you'll calculate this number, what you really need is a machine that will know what to do with that rule. Babbitt called this machine the \"auxiliary\": an electronic device that will use symbols to represent symbols and, in turn, will use numbers to produce numbers.\n\n\nBabbitt showed that a mathematical function could be expressed with a single symbol, and he found that the logic behind this could be carried out by a digital computer as well.\n\n\nLater, when Babbitt and John von Neumann were working at Bell Laboratories, the US military intelligence agency, they began to realize that the language of the digital computers now being created would prove surprisingly useful. At Bell, von Neumann established the first research division dedicated to developing programs that would take information and transform it in ways that would represent that information as information. This became the foundation of the Information Processing Techniques Office at Bell, and it was initially known as the \"Sputnik\" program, after a Soviet spacecraft that had launched on July 4, 1957. It was also named after an early computer program Babbitt created in the 1940s \u2014 Sputnik for computers.\n\n\nThe development of the digital computer allowed for a greater level of abstraction for the computer programmer \u2014 a computer could now be used to analyze the meaning of its own program. That was possible because of the way that information was represented using binary numbers \u2014 something that had, in the past, only been possible because of binary language. By the 1960s, Babbitt's approach was increasingly adopted by the computer industry, and it was the standard computer language from which all computer code is now translated.\n\n\nIn 1970, the Xerox PARC, now part of Xerox, released its Alto computer, which was first sold to retailers in 1975. The device was, literally speaking, an assistant to a man \u2014 this electronic assistant could be used to perform tasks.\n\n\nThe first app that was offered on the Alto was called \"Echo\" and \u2014 after being loaded onto a Alto \u2014 it performed all of the functions that were previously performed by a telephone operator.\n\n\nToday, the Alto has become a staple of the office, thanks partly to the fact that it does a little of everything, and also in part to a marketing campaign that promised the computer could \"talk\" to man.\n\n\nAlto devices are also used for purposes as diverse as financial and legal advice, personal financial planning, and as an educational tool \u2014 particularly for students struggling to navigate the complicated labyrinth of their higher education.\n\n\n\"It's the same computer operating in a different form,\" noted computer scientist Doug Engelbart, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"It is very, very easy to think about the Alto on two levels, both as a machine and as a service \u2014 it can be either very useful or very frustrating.\"\n\n\nWhat is more, by connecting wirelessly to a computer, the Alto can act as a remote control. In other words, it can act as the computer on your desk, allowing you to use it to control your television or your satellite dish.","token_len":784,"entropy":[9.89,0.6481,7.0505,7.5315,2.6425,3.4566,1.8077,0.299,4.9263,10.9649,0.008,0.0005,0.2141,2.9063,3.5995,3.7433,11.0602,2.8537,0.7969,3.0213,3.776,2.3324,0.5062,4.7679,3.5035,1.0612,2.156,3.7134,4.5248,2.1413,3.4513,2.0411,5.1242,0.2499,0.5101,0.5854,3.4999,0.3443,0.1073,0.0025,0.4088,1.5657,0.5701,0.7358,0.1388,5.3755,0.0002,3.7688,2.288,2.8701,3.3009,0.0103,5.0685,3.1266,0.1131,4.28,4.9551,0.0076,0.7097,4.1971,0.947,3.4301,0.3204,2.3037,3.4184,1.1965,2.4731,2.0409,0.0094,0.5425,2.8721,3.2197,1.1469,0.1225,0.3456,2.4799,1.3112,2.051,3.9237,0.2597,1.4285,3.2646,0.3908,1.0794,3.4909,1.3109,0.4237,2.087,1.2145,2.5481,5.4636,0.795,1.8482,0.3539,1.1442,0.9776,3.4485,1.9642,4.8893,0.7889,0.002,1.3911,0.3675,2.7084,0.8751,4.6679,6.2678,2.8667,1.7473,1.6425,1.4346,0.8052,2.9857,5.0122,0.0297,5.5883,1.7524,0.4041,2.9123,3.4436,1.8684,2.0248,2.5881,3.4182,3.7765,0.2447,7.6668,4.7847,2.675,0.0338,0.2861,6.3245,3.8956,0.4407,0.0017,0.0002,4.7724,0.7134,4.9589,1.4321,2.5854,0.4751,6.0303,3.8661,1.3618,1.0421,0.0035,1.1913,1.0993,4.1607,2.2349,2.2785,4.6742,3.8837,2.8462,2.4459,1.1121,4.9784,0.5263,0.9775,2.1042,0.4358,0.3568,1.8767,0.2666,1.6578,5.9616,2.993,1.1869,0.1653,0.96,1.3709,4.7061,0.7651,3.2605,0.0037,0.0003,2.4654,0.3671,0.7808,1.5,0.7096,6.0016,0.0211,3.8152,3.3359,1.8623,0.8986,0.2879,2.2673,4.8276,5.6673,0.8386,3.3318,5.3135,1.8241,3.4113,1.2083,0.3892,0.0023,1.7474,1.3901,1.1223,0.1206,2.8484,0.4665,0.1621,0.9831,0.0003,1.9763,0.0078,0.0002,5.0533,0.2693,2.3634,5.1504,3.0286,1.223,0.1449,1.6933,4.1816,1.2026,3.343,1.6388,1.2643,1.4015,2.3822,5.2333,0.2793,1.8482,5.7298,2.9544,1.82,2.409,0.0954,4.5544,1.2908,1.2417,0.7934,4.8519,0.1808,4.6108,0.4969,0.3266,2.6083,0.0003,5.2316,0.5438,3.7795,2.3213,0.0305,0.0002,2.733,3.7058,1.1491,0.0001,0.0024,1.4821,1.2933,2.2893,1.8961,1.4488,0.5084,2.7364,5.6244,2.2817,4.6949,0.6293,0.5244,0.8137,3.7223,0.6569,2.7512,0.1208,1.6102,5.3634,0.7577,2.1946,1.4508,2.4326,7.2461,1.556,2.7538,1.6871,4.8741,6.6343,0.6121,1.5253,4.3492,1.9033,0.8953,1.8282,0.0007,0.0168,6.4116,0.9065,1.2334,4.1403,3.194,1.7482,0.14,2.7583,5.5011,0.8684,1.2453,3.6032,3.8318,1.7253,2.1953,0.0159,4.0352,2.0627,0.2833,1.1948,6.3286,4.1969,0.0813,2.5117,4.0445,0.8578,2.5312,3.6873,0.8761,1.332,0.4886,0.8636,3.5904,0.3551,0.0224,2.4458,1.9462,0.5279,2.0383,1.1223,1.4114,1.2207,6.0225,2.4774,0.0915,0.2852,1.7811,5.6116,2.2063,0.1372,0.8219,2.4512,2.3697,0.8505,2.1066,1.7916,3.7465,0.5737,1.0353,2.6192,2.302,3.0487,0.2569,0.2497,0.0189,0.3419,3.7843,0.5448,3.7057,3.9119,0.7243,3.4279,2.2473,1.7856,1.346,4.2424,0.0036,0.0007,2.2948,3.2841,1.0892,3.0297,0.0759,4.0259,3.1979,0.0006,0.0022,3.1018,5.2453,0.5063,0.3354,0.0003,1.7775,4.296,0.0444,0.8795,1.2584,0.4698,3.9029,2.2747,1.8146,4.2405,2.9307,0.0048,1.0762,3.9146,1.3488,2.9807,2.2662,3.5023,1.8997,2.6474,1.4769,2.0765,1.5331,1.9501,0.2452,4.1335,2.2631,3.2612,0.1807,3.1758,1.1572,3.725,1.2282,4.6994,2.6435,4.0927,0.2695,2.2988,0.2911,2.4962,1.3177,3.0737,0.865,1.2413,5.4833,2.772,0.8693,1.9796,6.1235,0.602,1.7456,4.7933,2.7241,0.9813,0.8908,0.0049,2.299,0.091,0.4782,4.4679,0.1705,6.226,4.667,0.3445,3.8434,1.3943,2.5543,0.0102,0.0803,4.1602,0.0202,0.0005,1.4526,5.5426,1.5697,5.2519,3.0611,0.3942,1.3752,1.2657,0.8755,1.1668,0.5675,1.8278,1.1792,2.7129,4.3917,4.2969,0.3755,4.2724,1.7058,1.0818,2.3244,3.9829,1.6048,1.0953,4.0186,0.2358,0.4148,0.0003,2.33,3.8932,0.0476,1.6713,5.5474,0.0,0.9802,0.0054,2.8261,3.8362,1.9387,0.001,1.7324,0.0,1.0853,2.5602,1.7806,4.003,0.6807,0.9255,0.808,1.0505,6.1776,2.3208,1.0679,4.2376,1.797,3.4013,0.4222,1.464,3.8369,0.9544,4.3763,5.811,4.5356,0.0046,1.9346,6.3088,2.8265,1.489,4.3037,2.0716,5.9102,6.675,0.8747,1.7529,2.7054,0.7016,0.2582,2.5825,1.8252,4.6904,3.0932,0.0003,1.4748,2.4597,5.8127,1.1657,1.327,5.4313,1.2722,0.2365,0.1967,0.1887,1.3138,0.9734,4.9091,2.3306,1.9213,0.6736,7.1318,4.6446,3.3574,4.9148,0.8634,1.9905,2.5896,0.7695,1.5681,5.375,4.4172,1.3812,0.1802,0.7949,1.4236,2.1434,2.2405,1.402,0.1979,0.4617,2.8894,0.7327,0.4131,2.2407,0.0003,4.3516,0.128,1.5247,1.6275,3.0121,1.3285,1.2211,2.943,0.5222,0.8762,3.1348,1.3227,5.9123,5.7782,0.033,0.8436,1.8132,0.0065,0.5355,4.4346,2.7479,5.8144,2.6837,0.1415,1.9278,0.9727,2.3621,2.4613,0.4195,0.2931,3.4703,3.9826,0.7532,0.729,4.9239,2.6973,3.503,1.505,2.1709,2.2808,0.5988,0.3246,7.9038,0.4275,1.1818,0.0003,4.5185,0.1199,5.0639,1.5289,2.1155,1.4068,2.1886,5.7872,3.3413,0.7288,0.0095,4.7753,3.4041,2.015,2.2592,0.3219,4.1274,4.4844,0.3189,0.2701,1.475,3.7602,2.3888,2.042,0.2451,2.9804,5.063,0.7767,2.3963,6.4804,1.1798,4.5106,0.6333,2.7315,5.1851,0.4334,2.8586,5.4506,0.0623,0.5199,0.6272,0.0003,4.8329,2.8569,0.6631,2.822,3.6542,4.0484,5.3617,1.8182,1.6553,1.5832,2.369,0.7206,4.9013,3.8465,0.3433,5.4691,0.666,0.002,1.014,2.5199,4.5521,0.3024,2.3613,0.03,0.0914,2.9805,0.124,0.8991,0.4986,1.2216,3.1824,3.7549,3.2419,0.0028,2.7994,0.2191,4.1621,1.9035,1.7198,1.8897,6.6401,4.2628,0.6087,2.2243,4.2609,0.411,0.249,3.1926,0.5481,0.2186,0.2085,4.0397

{"id":4749,"ended":false,"length":693,"gen_text":"Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan ; having spent most of the season profiting from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a Mercedes wheel-banging for fourth place just six minutes into the race\n\nAlonso did eventually win the race for McLaren, although this was down to a car that in the grand scheme of things was a complete disaster on the opening lap\n\n2007 was the last time Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates in Formula 1\n\nLewis Hamilton's record at the season's end was 15 World Championships, two titles, one Drivers' Championship and 11 British Grand Prix wins\n\n2008\n\nJenson Button finished on the podium at seven races out of nine with a best race performance of fourth place for McLaren\n\n2007 was the last time Fernando Alonso won a race in Formula 1 with McLaren\n\n2009\n\nFelipe Massa ended the year in the points for the first time since 2005\n\n2010\n\nSergio Perez finished second in five races but only managed to finish on the podium three times with seven other finishers finishing in the points\n\n2011\n\nJenson Button finished third in just his second season as a Formula 1 driver\n\n2012\n\nLewis Hamilton finished second in the standings to Max Verstappen in his first season as a Formula 1 driver\n\n2013\n\nSebastian Vettel won his first two races and finished second in the standings\n\n2014\n\nJenson Button missed out on a fourth position finish as Vettel took his fourth consecutive victory\n\nAfter this you might notice a trend, and that's no doubt very much in keeping with my own writing style. The above is my list of the top ten races in Formula I but with an eye to the history of each race in the sport.\n\nWhat I didn't cover is the many high-profile collisions that often take place in Formula 1; for example the Lewis Hamilton & Jenson Button battle in Hungary, where the Mercedes collided and with the Mercedes having been disqualified, it was deemed that the race was over \u2013 Hamilton was told off, while not even the stewards could determine who caused the accident; Vettel did not even have any form of victory.\n\nThis has, in common with the history of my previous articles, led to the fact that I've been unable to fully write and publish all of the pieces I want to, because I've kept running into many of the same problems of not being able to get the photos and video that are so integral to a proper writing process because I'm not in Finland anymore and then running long into the deadline for this article.\n\nBut I can, to my best knowledge, bring my stories to a very close; I've even been able to put the finishing touches to the two parts of the two-part article for this article (if you haven't read part one yet then you might want to, it's a good read) and will be able to finish off the rest of the article by midnight GMT on Saturday, 28th of January.\n\nIn the meantime, for my fellow EGT readers (including those in Finland) and anyone else who's followed me here at F1 Fanatic: thanks for reading, and thank you to the writers of the articles that appear here on The F1 Fanatic; for a season that's been filled to the brim by so much content, I am really honoured to be able to work with all of you; we work on the basis of mutual respect and even though there have been some pretty rough moments in the writing of this article for me, I really hope that you have all enjoyed my contribution to the Formula 1 industry and our collective understanding of the sport.\n\nThanks for the great memories!\n\n-

{"id":3436,"ended":true,"length":746,"gen_text":"Despite efforts by broadcasters to educate viewers on TV Everywhere services and how to utilize them ( including Fox, who featured a promotional video with Jane Lynch as her Glee character Sue Sylvester, and NBC who has a list of useful resources ), Nielsen's measurement method still has a way to go. In November 2015, Google Play officially added TV Everywhere to their platform to help their customers save time and money on subscriptions. In 2016, we expect that Nielsen will be able to measure time spent watching TV Everywhere content.\n\nIt is a very good thing for viewers if you offer up data that helps them determine the value of their subscriptions. As we have discussed with the various services that have stepped into the space, the services need to get better at providing accurate metrics to our viewers. While the TV Everywhere measurement methods may be more accurate at the moment, it still takes a considerable effort to get those metrics right. One of Nielsen's biggest challenges are its viewers: Nielsen's clients include many of the largest cable and satellite companies. It's impossible not to think that some of these clients are making their numbers less accurate. Nielsen won't address that topic here, but given its market position, and the enormous amount of data that it gathers daily, it's a question worth examining.\n\nNielsen measures TV viewing on TV screens where consumers own one of the following set-top boxes (including tablets, game consoles, streaming media players, and game consoles with an SD player): the Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Nexus Player, Roku, SNES, Sony PlayStation game consoles, and others. The measurement method uses the signal level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from these set-top boxes as a reference. In layman's terminology, this makes it easier to compare ratings between different types of devices, such as in the below chart:\n\nIt's important to note that the SNR measurement takes time to reach a satisfactory level. For example, the signal will not reach a SNR of 90% reliably for one day per week unless it is given a good boost by good weather or people using set top boxes that help boost their SNR. A bad day can also disrupt the rating even if it did not affect its SNR. In addition, we do not yet have a solution that gives the exact level of signal generated by the cable set top boxes. If you own a device that offers multiple channels, the signals from these devices will interfere with each other.\n\nSome of the caveats we discussed earlier are:\n\nThe signal level is not the same for all channels because they use different sources of the signal.\n\nOnly one box is measured at a time and so it can be difficult to see how each channel is impacting the overall ratings performance.\n\nAs set-top box users, we have the ability to see which channels we watched on those platforms, which is not available to most of our clients. This is the reason why it's important to choose a decent set top box and understand how your channel subscriptions affect your home network.\n\nThere may be an issue with the channel's content delivery network that causes the signals from Nielsen (including its measurement devices) to not be measuring your channels properly. If that's the case, it may not necessarily affect the ratings that the channel is displaying in its ratings.\n\nAs a result of all of the above, a good number of cable companies are investing in content delivery systems to receive their channel signals, and Nielsen is also looking to improve the reliability of the data it receives. The solution for those of us who want to avoid signing up for cable will likely be based around a different set of tools for measuring our television consumption. Those of us who want our cable subscriptions will have to make do with whatever software the companies offer to help them gather all the available audience

{"id":2405,"ended":true,"length":738,"gen_text":"The IPC defines this class for para @ - @ Nordic skiing as for `` with impairments in the lower limb ( s ) and the trunk. Athletes have near normal trunk muscles activation, so they should not feel the difference between using their natural leg and artificial leg, but they will have lower hip and spine flexion problems and reduced range of motion. Also, they will not be as comfortable using the artificial leg with lower hamstring flexion.\"\n\nThere are no specific IPC rules on whether or not artificial legs are prohibited on a crosscountry course. In 2009, the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that artificial legs are allowed on crosscountry ski slopes with the use of a helmet. In the US, IPC rules on artificial legs are more lenient but do state that artificial legs are prohibited:\n\nIt is recommended by IPC that artificial limbs are not to be used in cross country ski facilities, provided that use of an artificial limb can be performed in the natural stride without significant discomfort or difficulty. In such cases, there is no need to limit the athlete's options based on the prosthesis.\n\nAs with other sports, artificial legs are a great aid in reducing the fatigue and pain from quad performance. They promote a higher level of quad strength and performance, but there can be a trade off between the reduced range of motion and the increased weight, which will negatively affect the athlete. For athletes who will be using artificial legs throughout their snowboard career, there are a lot of variables to take into consideration. The ski community has a lot of expertise and knowledge that the average spectator does not know about. While these are the best and\/or only ways to use artificial legs, the ski world is not the only place where these options exists. In light of what I've written above, this is certainly something I would look into when considering artificial legs in the future.\n\nWhat I didn't cover is the many different techniques for adjusting your stride. There are so many ways for skiers to adjust their stance; it's almost impossible to write this article without including them all. I'd like to include a few tips on how to perform the most beneficial change at the right time.\n\nAdjusting your stride when the snow is soft\n\nMost people have seen some form of this technique at least once in their ski career. There is no set rule for this technique. Instead, ski manufacturers have developed specific snowmaking techniques that are based on the slope's characteristics and the degree of slope slippage.\n\nTypically, this snowmaking technique is performed during the first few inches of the run off, not during the second or third ski before the launch. You can start this technique on any snow that is softer than your skis (if it's soft enough). As a skier starts to turn, just shift your weight forward by about 20-30 degrees. Keep the turn as fast as possible, not leaning or pushing. If your snow is a bit harder the longer you're in the turn, you can tighten up the control of your turn in the following portions by releasing the skis more or making an in-turn move. It's often more advantageous to start your turn a bit earlier in the run and release the skis as you approach the launch. If your snow isn't completely soft and you think it might be, you can always use a small plastic bag (available at your ski\/board store) to tamp down the softer snow before you turn or launch your turn as needed.\n\nWhy is an artificial ski better than a natural ski?

From right to left, they were Mass\u00e9na with two divisions on the coast, La Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise on the Seine front opposite Paris and Brouage with two divisions on the Meuse.\n\nThe battle of Rheims - 12 May 1796\n\nOn 12 May 1796, the Swiss saw their first successful action. As the Swiss were occupying a strategic position, they were expected to attack at Rheims and take it by storm.\n\nThe cavalry, commanded by Sir Charles Charette fought their way into the positions of the French infantry; Charette knew that for the Swiss to take the town with a majority of troops, they needed heavy cannons or infantry.\n\nAt Rheims, Charette's cavalry were in the rear trying to repel the French infantry, but soon spotted French soldiers from the guns and opened fire on them. As soon as they found the French guns, the cavalry attacked them and managed to cut their supply lines.\n\nWhile Charette was fighting for the victory, the cavalry of the British attacked from the west and attacked the French positions on the north. The British did not use very much force, but they were very aggressive and kept attacking the French. The British army had a great success and now had the advantage.\n\nMeanwhile, the French were fighting without any weapons and were pushed back. The French infantry were surrounded and had few weapons.\n\nWhen the Swiss saw the French had lost all their weapons and were surrounded, they decided to surrender at least and let the French army escape.\n\nAfter the surrender, Charette was the sole commander of the Swiss forces and was awarded the Cross of Gallantry. After the war, Sch\u00e9rer was appointed to be the commander of the Swiss army.\n\n1796 - 1799\n\nThe Swiss army was under the command of the Austrian Emperor Joseph I. After the French lost the battle of Vincennes, the Swiss abandoned the army and concentrated on defending the fortresses of Montreux, Berne, Schaffhausen and Lausanne.\n\nIn 1796, the French defeated the Swiss at Ch\u00e2lons which was a strategic stronghold, but lost the victory at Vincennes.\n\nFollowing this defeat, the Swiss had retreated and the Swiss army was on the retreat. On 10 June 1796, the Swiss occupied the villages of Oesel, Aubervilliers and Rheims. They also occupied a strategic position near Aubervilliers.\n\nAs the Swiss army started to withdraw towards Lausanne and the city, the troops were encircled by the French troops led by Marshal Rochambeau-Vernant who also tried to hold the city. The French army also wanted the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the city of Montluce which were in the center of French control.\n\nWhen the army of the King of Prussia, under Robert Scharnhorst attacked the French army at Aubervilliers, the French attacked again in the city and were defeated. On 17 June 1796, the situation had been stabilized and the Swiss forces had re-established their military authority in 1796.\n\nAs a result of this defeat, the Swiss Army disintegrated in the

{"id":4290,"ended":true,"length":716,"gen_text":"In 1912 Stamper began writing songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913, contributing Just You and I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as \"Benny Stamper\" or \"Mr. Stamper\":\n\nMr. Stamper\n\nWith all due respect, I never heard the terms'music composer' or'musician' before I entered show business. I was introduced to this occupation during my first run after coming to Chicago. I had not yet finished high school and had never had any special training. However, it seemed to me that the music business, or being a musician, was what I wanted to do. To this day, I am never able to figure out what caused me to do with music. A few of my songs may have been heard by some people who appreciated the melodious quality of the tunes and the rhythm, some with little appreciation because they thought I was merely singing the songs, and a great many were not well received, as there was so much music about the business, but I have made some of the best songs I have ever written. I have not received any professional compensation for them, although I know many who have. I like to say, however, that from that day to this, I have written more than fifty songs and composed more than forty of those which will appear on the album.\n\nThe next five years brought several more hits, including My Dream of the Opera, This is the Scene, I Think of You at Night and Do You Remember, though that last is not included on the boxed set.\n\nAfter this period, Stamper and Houghton toured the country, including Europe and Japan, writing and performing the songs The Ballad of Joe and Eddie, The Great Gatsby, You and I, The Moon and You and I. Houghton returned to Chicago to record these, then took up another job in Hollywood, writing the film scores for the movies Great Expectations and My Fair Lady.\n\nWhile playing in the Ziegfeld Follies, he composed an original song, My Boyfriend.\n\nHis last, and not widely circulated, recording was given to the Library of Congress in 1960 under the title The Bluebird Song. It also won an original songwriting award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He had one further record, written by his sister and published in 1955, on the recording list of the National Association of Recording Arts and Letters -- the first of several such awards.\n\nOther works, such as \"The Windmills of Your Mind,\" were recorded by other Broadway artists. Among them were Josephine Ross on piano and Paul Newman on saxophone, recording it at John Adams' studio in the basement of the Hotel Pennsylvania. After the show ended, Newman announced that the song was \"all right, and it may never be written again,\" but Ross was apparently unfazed by this, and the recording was issued in the same decade as All of a Sudden I Fell in Love at First Sight by the same session players, under the same producer. Ross also sang \"Oh, how I hate that song, 'Oh, how I hate that song'\" on an old song called \"The Last Night of the Lilies\" on the classic 1961 album Songs and Songs... by Leonard Bernstein.\n\nStamper also wrote for films, such as A Lady in the River by Claude Jarre, I am a Singer-Songwriter on Broadway (a composition of music and lyrics by John Philip Sousa and Victor Herbert ) and One Last Kiss (Music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Mary E.

{"id":3414,"ended":false,"length":720,"gen_text":"From 1890 to 1892, the ship was re @ - @ boilered at the Imperial Arsenal on the Golden Horn. Following the Greco @ - @ Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the military and political situation in the Caucasus, Russia and Turkey put the ship to sea for use in the Crimea. After the Crimean War, the Russian Navy chose to equip the vessel with a gun platform as the ship required more firepower than those equipped with the old single guns of her size. As the Crimean War ended before any other Russian Navy ship \u00a0made use of her, the ship was placed in charge of the Naval Station at Archangel, being one of the ships from that station that survived the war! After the War, the ship remained in port for a short time, with a brief career on the Mediterranean sea for use as a tugboat. As a tender vessel \u00a0during the Civil War in 1891, the ship was used extensively \u00a0for the use of the Armenian, Georgian and Armenian-Turkish navies. After the War, she was sold and the proceeds used to purchase the ship's mast and other accouterments! This ship, the Tbilisi, went to the Spanish Navy for repairs and then to the Turkish Navy, where she remained for 2 years, until 1915. In 1918, the ship was acquired by the Turkish Government and, by 1921, was under French command \u00a0with the crew returning to the ship. At the outbreak of World War I, Tbilisi \u00a0was commissioned as a cruiser. After the Great War, she was ordered by the Russian Navy to join the Czar's flotilla in 1915 and served at least until 1919. At that time \u00a0she changed ports and, by 1922, the ship was refitted on the French shipyard in Brest \u00a0and then re-christened Alexandria! After the ship was refitted in Brest, she became the flagship of the Russian Baltic Fleet. At this time, she also served in the Russian Navy's flagship fleet. In 1925, she served for a time as the flagship of the Romanian fleet, but was returned to the Russian Navy \u00a0after the signing of the Treaty of Paris \u00a0that year. Two years later, at the outbreak of the Great Depression \u00a0in 1929, Alexandria \u00a0was ordered by the Russian Government to sail to Egypt to offer financial support to those who needed it. However, at the time that Alexandria \u00a0was about to sail to Alexandria, Great Britain \u00a0had declared war on Germany \u00a0and she was ordered back to her home port. In the following years, despite this, she served in the Fleet \u00a0during the German invasion of Finland. When the invasion ended in 1939, she was again ordered back to the Russian fleet. However, this time, the war against Germany ended before the Russians could have the ship repaired. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, her flagship was sunk by the German Navy before she could be repaired, but no Russian ship was destroyed in a similar manner. While the ship was being repaired, the Russian Navy put out feelers that they would be willing to lease the ship to the Italians \u00a0if they were to put her to sea. The Italians \u00a0were not interested in the ship, which she was no longer capable of, so the Russian Ministry of Naval Affairs put the French to work with the French Naval General Staff \u00a0to design a new ship. This new ship was finally finished in 1944 as the Tassie, but not until the ship could again be fully manned, which she could not do until September 1945.

{"id":1353,"ended":true,"length":685,"gen_text":"Haifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army after overrunning Ottoman positions armed with spears and swords. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Haifa when they were halted by the sudden arrival of Indian soldiers. The incident was recounted in a poem called 'The Lopburi Massacre' by the poet-cinematographer, William Nicholson, and later became an iconic part of the British-Indian history of Palestine. During the Second World War, Haifa was a key British-Indian base for war preparations, and the Japanese bomb-dropped the city on 26 June 1944. The British evacuated the city, which was renamed Singapore and the Red Fort; a few days later, it was captured by the Vichy French. The Allied forces evacuated Haifa on 13 February 1945. Haifa, along with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is the only city liberated by the Allies without bloodshed after decades of brutal occupation by Europe's occupying and occupiers.\n\nHaifa, Israel's beautiful jewel\n\nHaifa's modern city center is home to the tallest clock tower in the Middle East, the oldest mosque in the world and the world's largest glassed-in observation deck atop the Old City Hall building. Located on the shores of Lake Kinneret, where the shoreline slopes down to the Mediterranean Sea, the city is a great gateway to the Middle East, and the capital city of the State of Israel. The city and surrounding areas provide access to the sea, the Negev desert and Jerusalem. Haifa is the place to find the world's beautiful jewels. The City of David and Holy Sepulchre sit in the city center; it is also significant, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its many ancient Christian and Muslim monuments.\n\nLamenting a missed opportunity\n\nHaifa was the gateway to Jerusalem and a key junction in the history of the Holy Land. At different times, haredim, the Jewish ultra-Orthodox, Jewish communities in Israel, and Arabs, have lived side by side peacefully, and their differences have been resolved through dialogue. The city was used as an Israeli base after the First Arab-Israeli War, the siege of Gaza in 2006, and the occupation of Judea and Samaria in 1967.\n\nThe city's Jewish residents are mostly settled around the Western Bank towns of the heartland of religious and cultural Zionism. Haifa has witnessed several violent clashes over religious difference and the issue of the Arab Israeli community's existence in Judea and Samaria, and the city has some of the high crime rates in the country.\n\nHaifa is famous for its green hills that surround it, and the city is rich in history. On the shore of Lake Kinneret, a dramatic natural natural bridge can be found straddling the border between France and Judea, and it also provides access to the Mediterranean Sea for many Israelis. In the Old City, the city's famous Temple Mount and nearby Al-Aqsa Mosque are located.\n\nHaifa is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It also has a number of museums and architectural monuments, such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Citadel, as well as excellent restaurants and food. The city has also seen a lot of economic growth, and tourism has become significant in the city.\n\nThe city is famous around the world, and the people in Haifa are proud of the city as they celebrate anniversaries, festivals and the birthdays of famous Israelis like Dovid Alonge, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Yoel Hatorah, and Abraham Shem Tov.

{"id":1261,"ended":false,"length":615,"gen_text":"Named after Georg von Derfflinger, a German field marshal during the Thirty Years'War, Derfflinger was commissioned on 1 September 1914. A dockyard crew transferred the ship from Hamburg to Kiel, where it was in drydock since early October, before sailing to Brest on 31 October. On 1 November, Kiel officially received the ship.\nAn empty boat arrives at the new ferry landing on the Baltic near Kiel.\nWith German occupation of Denmark and Norway after the Treaty of Versailles, Kiel was a target of German anti-submarine efforts and on 1 August, the L\u00fctjungsloot (L\u00fctzow) was torpedoed by a U-boat off Kiel. Several civilian and military boat operators arrived to ferry survivors, the boat's crew, and equipment from Kiel to L\u00fctjungsloot while another passenger ship arrived to pick up some prisoners.\nOn 18 February 1919, the L\u00fctjungsloot suffered another major accident. German submarines attacked again off Kiel and killed five civilians who tried to save some of the casualties from the torpedo attack. In response, the German naval minister in Kiel requested permission for German submarines to launch raids on shipping from Kiel. On 2 March, Kiel was bombed by a U-boat while leaving its berth. When the naval officer who was commanding the ship at the time noticed the impact of the explosion, he ordered the ship to the dock, and the submarine launched its torpedoes on the L\u00fctjungsloot. The ship sank two hours later, killing all on board.\nFollowing the attack, many Germans resented the loss of lives aboard the ship; it further damaged the reputation of the U-boat crew.\nAlthough the Kiel L\u00fctjungsloot is rarely mentioned in the sources, in the German records the ship was sometimes referred to as the L\u00fctjungslurk.\nThe L\u00fctjungsloot was not the only ship of the same name lost in the Baltic during World War II. On 25 December 1940, during the Norwegian Campaign, an armed German patrol boat, the L\u00fctjungslurk, ran aground on the island of Sommersje (Sommaree). When Norwegian soldiers came ashore, they tried unsuccessfully to rescue the officers and crew of the L\u00fctjungslurk. When the officers on the ship's bridge spotted the Norwegian soldiers and thought they were German soldiers trying to abduct them, she tried to ram the Norwegian patrol boats. The sinking of the ship killed 15 Norwegian sailors and four of the German command.\nIn July 1941, on Operation \"Stalin\", more than sixty German submarines attacked French transport ship Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry-Langeau. In January 1942, the L\u00fctjungslurk was one of two ships sunk, along with the L\u00fctjungslurk, by German U-boats off of a French submarine base. The L\u00fctjungslurk survived, but sank in February 1942 when it was shot at by a French torpedo boat.\nFollowing the sinking of the L\u00fctjungslurk, French authorities began to evacuate survivors from Kiel on 8 March.\nIn September, the ship made another short voyage to Norway, where she was abandoned by German crews.\nShe was later sold by the Dutch government, where it has been restored as a museum exhibit.\n\n\nT he L\u00fctjungsloot remains in Kiel to this day.

{"id":2355,"ended":false,"length":728,"gen_text":"Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called predatory bacteria. These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest gram-negative bacteria that are found growing in the environment, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which kills and consumes the gram-positive bacteria.\nAnaerobic metabolism is not a part of the natural ecosystem but rather part of the evolution of life. As a result, these bacteria have the potential to live outside the host body.\nPestalotiopsis tatarica, the organism responsible for the death of the caterpillar\nSo what are the effects of these predatory bacteria?\nA study performed on rats on diet containing these microorganisms found that, with time, the rats developed hyperactivity and elevated adrenaline levels. This results in a loss of inhibitions and a reduction in fear, which makes the animals more reactive and easy to influence. This is the opposite of the behavior that you find in a normal, peaceful state of animal behavior. Other studies showed that these microorganisms made some of the rats develop stomach ulcers. This means that not only was the host suffering from a fatal disease, but some of the organism had already attacked the body through the gastrointestinal tract.\nBut it isn't just the diet that these microbes present. When the researchers exposed the larvae (tissue derived from a caterpillar) of P. tatarica to these organisms, they also found that the offspring were more susceptible to infection and had a tendency to develop allergies. They also found that as they grew older, the offspring of these organisms were more susceptible to chronic disease due to their reduced resistance to the pathogens that they normally encounter in their environment.\nThe microorganisms that kill you are so effective in killing other organisms that they are causing the body to respond with all kinds of defenses. When your immune system is weak, these defenses turn into an autoimmune reaction that leads to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation can cause the immune system overreactions. The result being that the body's defenses can cause even more symptoms, which are seen by you as a chronic disease.\nIn the short term, it is likely that the infection will be relatively mild and even less dangerous than Lyme disease, if left untreated. However, eventually the infection will multiply, and it will eventually lead to cancer. When Lyme is in one place, the spores are hard to pass, yet when a new infection occurs in another part of the country, bacteria can easily penetrate the skin of humans. As a result, chronic inflammation, cancer, and autoimmune diseases can occur in people who are not aware that they have Lyme disease.\nIn one study, 70% of patients with chronic fatigue were convinced to take medication for Lyme disease instead of the standard over-the-counter remedies. As a result, the treatments that the doctors administer can be less effective at effectively treating the disease.\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease are much more extreme than the symptoms of other types of arthritis - and yet, it is often easier to diagnose in the chronic stages because pain is very common. Most patients that don't get diagnosed early will have to live with the chronic symptoms for the rest of their lives.\nIn summary, the most important thing you can do to protect yourself from exposure to parasitic infections is to wash your hands frequently when your fingers touch contaminated surfaces, and to avoid insect bite bites. It is a good idea to clean your room before sleeping so that dust from your clothing or bedding on your sheets or bedding doesn't stay on the room's surface.\u00a0\nIt is also a good idea to avoid places where your body will be most often contaminated, such as your dog's bed and its bedding. If you have tick bites, try not to remove the tick with your bare hands - or you might pick up the spirochete!","token_len":789,"entropy":[8.4191,0.9958,4.9132,6.988,4.1235,4.4197,3.5553,2.4959,2.6971,0.0435,1.4231,8.3602,4.8528,1.1468,0.744,8.0009,1.2513,0.3616,2.8104,3.8433,6.9429,1.0629,0.0036,4.8072,4.2558,0.4752,0.0127,3.882,0.0694,0.0226,0.6011,2.6436,6.3097,8.5574,0.0379,1.7751,4.8359,0.8977,3.56,1.5255,3.6363,6.0109,0.2436,0.7702,0.2369,4.5766,1.8317,2.1255,6.0498,0.6803,0.462,3.164,1.8712,0.8761,2.6308,0.0025,0.0206,0.0009,0.2076,0.0003,0.0027,0.001,0.1752,0.2229,3.4689,0.8481,0.9508,3.0629,1.8956,0.0269,0.1195,0.2974,2.4961,0.9988,12.6352,2.5832,0.1013,4.9348,1.1951,3.4345,1.9315,5.1008,0.0063,1.1089,2.8093,3.907,3.6279,3.0497,5.5111,0.0033,0.5182,3.7194,0.17,1.4505,0.9292,3.7935,1.9145,0.3569,0.225,3.3264,1.2658,2.2274,2.8771,2.6924,0.0645,4.2444,3.26,0.9977,3.294,2.3941,1.3167,1.5246,3.6537,4.4236,3.7197,0.1014,0.1757,4.6101,5.6303,0.1583,2.2266,2.0134,4.9812,1.9983,0.0077,0.939,3.7034,0.0716,0.9766,4.7422,0.2113,2.0333,4.8848,1.8149,2.4414,0.6578,2.8739,0.1215,1.9818,3.363,0.3042,0.8776,1.2972,3.4974,2.6325,4.0292,1.77,4.5271,5.8386,4.8967,1.3285,3.2048,3.656,0.2394,1.5942,0.2503,4.3555,5.1964,3.2015,0.0723,0.5557,1.5794,1.4845,4.9454,1.331,1.0312,5.4763,5.0985,0.239,0.8213,2.0144,4.3605,0.1363,2.1381,4.0779,0.0277,3.5082,0.0043,0.7702,2.0613,4.3744,0.271,2.7289,2.0872,1.5508,3.5673,0.8753,1.7139,0.8628,4.8172,0.9381,5.7673,0.3683,4.517,0.277,2.4946,1.5726,2.5302,2.7868,0.5087,1.1318,2.3447,1.9327,3.62,3.7121,0.1747,1.8615,2.1429,2.0063,5.7852,3.6874,0.3546,4.8728,1.4713,0.1898,5.5585,0.7551,3.4929,0.1926,1.8515,1.9005,0.0238,5.5646,4.8672,1.4018,0.1471,0.8101,3.0973,5.05,0.4018,0.014,1.3481,2.5327,3.1271,0.1735,5.2218,0.0456,3.2803,0.4304,3.119,4.9395,1.454,1.872,4.9425,1.9976,0.3391,0.2668,4.3799,0.1789,0.3614,4.964,2.9568,4.1273,4.5104,1.0956,2.6982,5.1438,0.691,3.3879,0.1878,0.4046,0.5223,5.225,3.2936,2.9267,0.001,0.4724,0.5262,6.0673,0.5154,3.3427,4.0868,5.7129,1.2204,4.3278,1.482,3.3725,2.662,0.807,5.0839,4.0677,5.4434,2.2209,6.0641,0.2759,2.3887,0.4384,0.0066,0.3467,0.7847,1.5403,0.2225,0.1565,0.0009,0.0038,0.1547,2.1599,2.3406,0.2894,0.7723,2.8846,2.0562,0.3817,0.6423,5.7853,2.002,1.4074,1.2993,0.0145,1.9006,2.2185,2.9332,1.2988,4.4615,0.1525,1.3727,4.9925,0.6102,3.6017,0.5286,1.6155,0.154,5.7955,3.2008,0.9814,1.3497,0.1868,0.6572,1.7597,2.0006,1.7635,2.7511,0.9519,0.5319,0.9185,0.0212,5.5527,3.3572,5.0826,0.0094,1.9239,3.2991,3.0995,0.2318,3.1911,2.276,1.3458,0.72,2.7989,2.02,1.9281,1.331,0.4569,0.0803,0.3892,2.2177,4.7154,0.175,1.6224,3.4412,4.1038,1.9969,5.387,3.3655,2.2454,2.0273,2.3224,1.0932,0.6476,0.6956,1.8403,6.2624,2.3431,4.5136,0.1196,5.0586,2.7593,5.5954,1.7594,0.0029,3.4287,0.874,3.6513,3.9194,0.4813,0.0325,0.6968,3.7865,0.2913,2.8129,3.8039,5.6483,1.8638,2.4158,3.087,1.9281,1.5634,2.6446,0.0458,2.4217,1.4049,1.1924,3.4876,0.0408,2.3604,2.2031,2.6281,2.5034,0.0339,7.6621,1.0531,3.3783,4.1771,2.6012,1.4503,5.1948,1.5957,0.8271,0.9061,3.1569,1.0218,3.451,4.9785,4.3855,0.1548,5.4834,1.7588,2.2425,2.459,5.6183,3.8409,5.2102,0.5895,1.6776,2.3121,0.9649,0.2704,0.5679,2.9931,1.7758,5.6714,0.2409,0.0844,3.3762,0.8543,3.6495,0.0862,1.3853,5.1934,1.7397,1.7342,4.7127,0.6621,1.5018,4.9352,5.4783,2.6228,0.9018,6.2143,0.257,1.6728,4.493,3.7497,0.1747,0.1375,1.5789,0.0551,5.1695,1.1296,1.9092,0.5839,5.8545,1.7679,1.63,2.6779,0.8255,2.3796,1.8875,0.0101,5.2423,1.406,4.3138,3.8048,3.3874,3.6953,5.6457,2.7668,0.5787,1.9719,5.8419,2.0846,5.5669,0.0383,6.269,1.3365,5.1747,1.5415,3.7224,3.2183,2.9299,1.7005,2.9806,0.4909,1.2328,0.008,0.1917,4.7972,0.2244,6.2306,1.4209,1.4923,4.1949,0.7396,1.0872,3.8946,3.4062,1.176,3.4889,1.0599,0.0203,0.0887,4.0868,0.9461,3.0538,3.0076,0.4033,0.3073,3.0502,2.0727,1.1932,1.4553,2.2502,2.4237,0.5627,1.4413,1.2174,2.7086,1.0053,0.1808,0.5975,1.4938,0.3268,0.1963,0.3275,2.9186,5.2371,0.7171,0.5424,5.7068,0.4977,0.0115,1.5117,0.9608,1.5343,1.1371,3.7153,6.2762,3.1537,2.5703,3.26,1.2593,1.7916,0.3908,6.1177,0.0292,2.701,3.5632,5.5188,0.2747,0.0014,0.0084,0.0009,3.3674,0.6735,4.5485,0.3459,0.0338,0.1996,1.6547,4.9144,2.1433,2.6346,2.4475,6.7145,2.4329,1.2169,3.9539,0.183,4.0433,5.8795,0.3557,0.4749,1.4737,0.3939,1.1427,2.2239,4.5814,0.4174,0.4856,0.1304,1.0984,4.9681,0.7222,4.7984,0.2405,1.6383,0.4756,0.1926,1.5423,3.4247,0.0024,2.5621,7.0382,3.371,3.2012,1.2904,2.8758,0.4609,2.2293,4.6822,0.115,0.7598,4.3776,1.6962,3.3112,3.0884,3.1979,6.3138,0.9294,4.9798,3.5065,0.7867,5.2738,1.897,3.9908,5.7216,0.0007,3.0909,2.9208,3.0746,2.0519,2.4888,2.4241,2.9839,0.0743,1.4504,2.0368,0.6951,0.8279,0.424,0.0106,0.0018,0.0032,0.0807,0.2505,0.5636,2.9633,3.3265,0.0664,1.6471,3.839,1.7085,0.9718,2.1687,0.0802,0.0165,0.6389,1.5258,0.1013,0.4869,5.9923,0.0784,5.0221,1.6341,0.2289,0.1131,4.7115,0.1234,0.036,1.7694,4.1458,5.2934,4.9213,2.117,4.1128,0.1467,1.4488,1.1604,0.8027,1.3091,5.7085,4.8699,2.9588,0.6933,4.0444,0.2768,4.7784,0.345,0.0341,0.0453,5.1707,1.0736,4.268,3.2668,2.7782,3.1471,0.2248,4.8936,3.8173,1.3986,4.7192,2.6176,0.6008,0.3888,7.2726,0.837,1.4101,2.3444,3.4977,1.

He played high school baseball in Rockford.[6][7] As a pitcher, Grove had a 6-0 record with a 1.86 ERA at Rockford and led the North Central League in saves three times.[8] Grove was named the Best Pitcher in the World by Baseball America; he finished 1st for the 1986 season.[9]\n\nGrove spent his first seven seasons with the White Sox. He was a member of the White Sox's championship teams in 1984 and 1985.[10] After an injury, Grove moved to Los Angeles and played one and a half seasons with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 1986.[6]\n\nIn 1990, Grove signed with the Reds as a free agent. In his first season with Cincinnati, he helped the Reds capture the World Series in 1991. Grove pitched one scoreless inning in the World Series.[11][12] After a year away from baseball, Grove became the pitching coach for the Florida State University baseball team. He had his contract terminated after a fight with his son.[13] The baseball team at FL State University is named in Grove's honor.[12][14] Grove retired following that incident as a full-time teacher.[13]\n\nGrove's first-season and strike-out numbers are very high, as Grove averaged 1.92 strikeouts per nine innings in his first full season in the Major Leagues.[8][15][16] He has been in the top-10 in career strikeouts each of the last seven seasons. He owns the largest strikeouts-per-nine-innings figure of any pitcher over the last two decades, at 1.88.[13]\n\nGrove was named to the 2004 All-Star team.

The Timberwolves released Grove on March 20, 2007. He spent the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons with the Grizzlies of the ABA.[5] Grove made the All-Star Game in both 2009 and 2010, and was named as a teammate of the All-NBA First Team again in 2011.[18]\n\nIn 2010, Grove was the final pitcher on the roster of the Chicago White Sox.[6] Grove recorded the lowest scoreless inning of his Major League career with the team, with an outing against the Athletics on July 12, 2010, in which he struck out one batter, throwing eight pitches, giving up an earned run on two hits, no walks, and two strikeouts. Grove won 12 straight games as the starting pitcher of the White Sox for a while, including the World Series.[19]\n\nAfter his retirement from playing, Grove became a pastor.\n\nNotable career

{"id":2378,"ended":false,"length":768,"gen_text":"Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause inserted into their contract that ended the comic book production in January 1989.\n\nWith Marvel's success in bringing Marvel characters to life in films and TV series, Moore and Gibbons' departure from DC Comics was a bittersweet ending. Moore remained active within the comics community \u2014 both before his first reunion with Marvel and after he made the announcement on his site he would be retiring his comics artist's pseudonym. He also became the new head of the British Comic Industry Awards (for Best Story and Best Cover of a Comic Book; he would also get a nomination for Best Newcomer with DC Comics' Frank Miller).\n\nIt was around this time Moore's involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe garnered his most attention. One of the first interviews Marvel Studios gave was to Moore during the Marvel Cinematic Universe press day in 2015. As part of their conversation, however, the interviewer asked Moore about his involvement with some of the key Marvel movies. His response? \"It's a great honor, and I get on with Marvel as much as I can.\" At the time, it was thought that this was very vague, but Moore has subsequently clarified to Wired.com that, in actuality, he's been interacting with Marvel Studios on other projects as well. At the San Diego Comic Con in July, Moore had a discussion with Marvel Studios President of Production Kevin Feige in which they discussed his work on Thor: Ragnarok and others. The two even met up for lunch and watched a Marvel film together. And when the time came for Marvel to give Moore a Screen Actors Guild Awards nomination, you could imagine their surprise when they found out that they had the chance to present Moore with their very first Screen Actors Guild Achievement Award \u2014 even if the honor may have been a little premature. Moore said at the event, \"It's nice to be nominated. Especially coming from a small comic book publisher. It's been a very interesting year, but you know, I've got work to do.\" Although, it was obvious that Moore's presence in the MCU made him the next big thing, he doesn't regret what he's done with Marvel so far. For him, it's just a part of his creative process \u2014 and the success of those films and TV shows has only reaffirmed that for him.\n\nMarvel now has many acclaimed properties to take up space on the shelves of movie theaters and, thanks to Netflix, some of them are coming back to television. Moore's inclusion in the Marvel universe may only be a beginning for him, and we'll likely see more of our favorite Marvel comic artists like Dave Gibbons and Dave Gibbons working alongside Marvel Studios executives (especially Feige) as they try to bring the Marvel universe to life in real life. Marvel Studios now has more to contend with than the movies, with Spider-Man: Homecoming being a hit and new shows like the upcoming Agent Carter, among others. To help maintain consistency, Marvel will be launching their \"Phase 3\" of comic book projects with a shared creative team as the next step in their ongoing story. While the new Avengers movies have been divisive and have yet to garner as much critical and fan acclaim as the first two ( The Dark Knight Rises and Iron Man 3 ), a good chunk of the people in charge of Marvel Studios know how to make good movies, and their first step towards winning back the fan bases they lost has been to hire some very good comic book artists who will do something with them as well. Whether anything comes of it remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Marvel fans are happy about it, even of the bad movies that may be made in the future. What do you think of this news?

{"id":3405,"ended":true,"length":718,"gen_text":"In addition to his military service as a mechanic, Allingham spent the vast majority of his professional life as an engineer. His employers included Thorns Car Body Makers, Vickers General Motors and Chrysler Corporation.\n\nAllingham attended the College of the Atlantic, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 1948. After graduation he enrolled in the University of Maine, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1950. In addition to his military training, Allingham had been an avid and experienced tennis player during his early life in Maine.\n\nAllingham's parents wanted him to become a nurse but he became an engineer because his father believed that it would provide him with the opportunity to earn more money. The Allen family lived on a farm in Waldo. Allingham's father worked on the farm and Allingham spent a lot of time with him, attending school with him and sometimes his school-age brother.\n\nA former member of the Navy, Allingham served as an officer in the Navy during the Korean War, and again in the Vietnam War. During his military service, he maintained his engineering training through his work in the Naval Aviation Engine room in Pensacola, FL. This was not Allingham's first military assignment, as he had served in the Second Louisiana Cavalry in 1944.\n\nAllingham served through the remainder of the Korean War which ended in 1973. During the Vietnam War Allingham went through a number of missions, working in the Vietnam Theater and at the Marine Intelligence Company in Saigon. He had spent a year in Vietnam, and at the end of this time he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross and two Bronze Hearts.\n\nAllingham earned an MBA at MIT in 1957 and, in 1960, the National Institute of Financial Education, a program for young leaders, named him an Instructor. One of the first things Allingham did was to study the financial statements of General Motors and Chrysler Corporation. He soon became a financial analyst specializing in automotive issues for the company.\n\nIn 1963, Allingham joined General Motors and was assigned to the automobile engineering department. Throughout this period he maintained his military training. In the mid 1960's, Allingham was assigned to Detroit to help oversee the restructuring of the automobile industry in the United States. This included the creation of Chrysler Corporation and, later, the Chrysler Corporation. He was put in charge of the engineering department, and the team that had developed and perfected Chrysler's new, innovative rear-wheel drive platform.\n\nAfter many years of working in finance and management, Allingham decided that he, like his mentor, Charles Kettering, would be a professional engineer. He was named Technical Director for Chrysler Corporation in 1973. When he retired from General Motors, Allingham went back to being an engineer. Allingham was a member of all of Chrysler Corporation's committees, such as the Engineering and Technical Committee, the Financial Committee, and the Research and Development Committee, and was also on the Special Advisory Committee for Safety, Reliability, and Environmental and Health Programs for Chrysler Corporation.\n\nWhen the Chrysler Corporation was sold to Fiat in 2008, Allingham was named Senior Vice-President of Engineering for Detroit Motor Company. There he became responsible for setting the goals, driving the strategies, and setting the priorities for the new Detroit-Fiat Chrysler and Fiat parent company.\n\nAllingham has been elected to The American Association for Automotive Engineers (AAEEE) Hall of Fame and the National Academy of Engineering, where he has served as the President on two committees, the Committee on Safety and Reliability and the Committee on Energy, Environment, and Man.

After emerging into the south @ - @ central Gulf of Mexico, the tropical depression rapidly intensified in intensity and moved to the northwest on July 24.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the center would continue to strengthen across the Yucatan peninsula to northwest of Manzanillo as of Saturday evening.\n\n\"The main threat is life-threatening wind damage and widespread and heavy rainfall during the next couple of days,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center warned that the wind and storm surge would build steadily as the system moved inland with the potential for life-threatening and deadly flooding.\n\n#hurricane is now located about 200 miles E of Manzanillo, Texas.

A tropical storm warning remains in effect for the northern Leeward Islands through Saturday night, but there were no watches or warnings in effect for neighboring Dominica.\n\nThe storm also will impact French Guiana and the islands off Haiti.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Monday is predicting that the system's circulation may be over the Yucatan peninsula. The U.S. NHC forecast that the system will be a category two hurricane at landfall sometime Tuesday morning in southern Texas.\n\nMore: Hurricane, then a hurricane? See the U.S. and Caribbean in the early morning hours\n\nMore: Hurricane Jose, a'strong Category 4 storm,' remains 'catastrophic' with 'life-threatening storm surge'\n\nThe system is one of many this year expected to feature a \"catastrophic\" storm surge and major flooding over the region. In May, a group of meteorologists warned that the region would have a \"near, or worse\" chance for at least two hurricanes within the next three years. The group claimed a worst-case scenario would see a category 5 hurricane, with wind gusts of more than 145 mph, landfall in the Texas and Louisiana regions by November.\n\nThe warning came on the heels of heavy rains over the past three days in Texas -- more than 1.2 inches in some parts of Dallas, Galveston, Houston and Houston-area metropolitan areas since Friday.\n\nIf the current forecasts hold true, the area could see between 3 to 6 more inches of rain total for the summer season.\n\nCLOSE Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia brought flooding, winds and other impacts to parts of the Caribbean and parts north of the U.S. including areas of Cuba and the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said in a weekly assessment Monday. Video provided by AFP Newslook\n\nThere was very little rainfall overall in the U.S. this weekend with the only measurable event coming from a heavy thunderstorm in Indiana.\n\nIn Texas, most of the state saw near-normal rainfall from tropical activity on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFEMA has opened an emergency operation center at the Houston-Galveston International Airport, located under the Harris County Administration Building, from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily (Monday through Friday) through Sept. 29 to assess the effects of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Jose on the Houston area.

{"id":3437,"ended":true,"length":703,"gen_text":"In a December 2013 survey of 4 @, @ 205 pay television subscribers, NPD Group found that 21 % of them used a TV Everywhere service at least once per month, and 33 % subscribe to one in the year since they first started watching TV.\n\nWhile TV Everywhere subscriptions were up 8% from the previous year, the report didn't provide any details on the source of the subscriber's TV Everywhere viewing.\n\nWith this data, we can now answer the question: Are any people getting their TV Everywhere on-demand content from Dish Network?\n\nWe're not surprised.\n\nA blog post written by Dish Network President and COO Joe Clayton in September of this year, shows a subscription to TV Everywhere through Dish Network as the second most popular pay television package available through his network:\n\nFor our TV Everywhere customers, more shows can be found through DISH Network via live TV anywhere in the U.S. There are also thousands of shows available and accessible online through DISH Digital, and there are more than 4,000 channels via Sling TV.\n\nThose figures sound good, and make it sound like there is a lot of content on Dish Network's streaming service on a daily basis. But what if you aren't a customer of Dish Network, but instead use AT&T Inc.'s DirecTV: The service will still work great with the latest apps on your phone... provided you already have DirecTV.\n\nIn an email to customers on January 26, the company's executive vice president of customer service, Mike Friese, explained:\n\nDirecTV streaming access for Android phones and tablets through the DIRECTV NOW application will work with the apps, and you can access DIRECTV NOW content on select Samsung Smart TVs and other streaming devices with an active U-verse Internet television service at no additional cost.*\n\nIt didn't sound like the new streaming service gave Dish's existing streaming customers any reason to subscribe to the DirecTV over-the-air feed anyway.\n\nAs it turns out, it was possible for people to start streaming for DIRECTV NOW subscribers in November of last year, right after the service had been rolled out.\n\nFryinge did indicate that DirecTV's latest apps would work seamlessly on devices like Android phones and tablets, as well as TVs. But he didn't tell us definitively that anyone who already had DIRECTV NOW would have the option to stream to their devices as well.\n\nSling TV has had Android TV apps since December of 2014, and as far as we can tell, people who are currently eligible for the service already have the opportunity to start using apps on those products, and we haven't seen any signs that anyone has taken advantage of the feature.\n\nWe reached out to Dish for comment, but so far there's been no reply. We've also reached out to AT&T for comment, but we have not heard back. We'll update this story as we get more information.\n\n*It's worth noting that DISH's online streaming service, Sling TV, is only available in the United States for the AT&T-DirecTV deal.\n\n[UPDATE] Dish's Mike Friese responded with this in a new blog post last week:\n\nDish has always been committed to providing our customers with a broad array of video technology choices when it comes to TV Over The Air content, and we are excited to support DIRECTV NOW with an expanded list of available apps on the Android TV platform.

{"id":2600,"ended":false,"length":746,"gen_text":"Spokane is known as the birthplace of the national movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and eventual establishment of Father's Day as a national holiday in the U.S.\n\nIn Spokane, in the year 1866, the nation's first Catholic men's club formed. In 1868, Father's Day was designated a national holiday to be observed by men and youth of America. The celebration took place on June 10.\n\nThere were no festivities for fathers on Father's Day until the 70's.\n\nWhen Spokane became a city in 1889, the Spokane Chamber of Commerce was created to promote the Chamber's mission with the use of Father's Day.\n\nIn 1900, Father's Day was changed to \"Father's Day\" and the ceremony was given an official date of June 9.\n\nPossibly more important than the change in date is the change from Washington as the state home of Father's Day to Spokane as the City of Fathers Day.\n\nIn 1968, Spokane County passed Ordinance No. 48-67 which changed the name of Father's Day from Father's Day to \"Father's Day in Spokane County\" and stated that on Father's Day in Spokane County, Spokane officials would hold a ceremony to honor fathers (through family members) on South Main Street, located one block east of the Spokane Municipal Building. (See Photo at the top of this page.)\n\nAfter Spokane County adopted Father's Day as an official holiday in 1968, Spokane County Superintendent of Schools, Rev. Eugene B. Wilson, issued an apology as follows: \"I regret that the name of Father's Day in Spokane County has come under attack in recent years. In view of the significant place that Father's Day has had in our County, and in light of the high esteem in which we hold his memory, I am deeply grieved that anyone would regard that name as disparaging to fathers. The name Father's Day has been used in connection with such celebrations as Christmas Day over a century. The only difference between Father's Day and Christmas Day is that the latter may be celebrated by any age group without discrimination.\"\n\nToday's Spokane, with its population of 320,037, is the second largest city in the greater Spokane region with a population increase of 16 percent in 2011 alone. About 18 percent of Spokane residents are from another county and more than 40 percent are students from another school district living in Spokane. Spokane has the highest per capita total student spending in the country, spending more than $12,000 per student per year. Spokane's total school enrollment of more than 17,000 students is fourth highest in the state.\n\nIn 2011, Spokane held three public ceremonies and a private ceremony, to recognize our families \u2014 the women who support us, the men who serve us and the boys who are not yet fathers.\n\nIn Spokane, Father's Day was \"celebrated\" for a variety of reasons. The primary rationale for a celebration was to thank local fathers and women who have contributed so greatly to the growth and development of Spokane since 1866. These men and women are \"founding fathers.\"\n\nToday's Spokane embraces many fathers (including men in foster care), whose sons have grown up to become men of prominence here in Spokane County and beyond. There are many local men and women who are fathers who have given to our lives here in community organizations, civic associations, fraternal organizations and other organizations that contribute to the well-being of Spokane families. Spokane is a wonderful place to raise a family.\n\nFatherhood Day in Spokane is not only about giving thanks to our fathers but also as a reflection on the past, present and future role fathers play in children's lives. It is a celebration of all parents, families of dads, and men of the future.\n\nFor additional information on the commemoration of Father's Day, visit Spokane's Father's Day Celebration

{"id":3559,"ended":true,"length":717,"gen_text":"People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through active participation in community life. Equine therapy is often employed to bring about beneficial physical and psychological improvements in persons with various disabilities. It should never be considered a substitute for the services provided by a proper therapist or a competent occupational therapist.\n\n\"With this training, [the horse] [the horse trainer] can see the horse in a whole new light\u2014like he is human again. With this training [horse trainer] can see the horse in a whole new light\u2014like he is human again. \" The article continues:\n\nIn the case of children who have been involved in the use of horses, horse use is beneficial by providing a physical outlet, mental stimulation, and a positive outlet for the child's imagination. The use of horses can provide an opportunity to exercise some of the physical demands placed on children with mental, sensory, physical, and\/or emotional disabilities.\n\n\"The relationship of the physical activities of a horse with the needs of a person with a disability and the needs of the child should not be ignored, however, because of the unique nature of physical activities involving horses. Horse trainers use their horses for recreation and leisure. When using a horse for physical activities, the trainer must make certain that these activities do not interfere with the horse's ability to care for and provide for itself.\n\n\"The horse trainer should consider the physical and psychological needs of the horse as they contribute to the horse's performance. The horse trainer should determine how much exercise and physical contact the horse needs during the day, and give specific consideration as to the horse's ability to engage in a variety of physical activities, such as jumping, rearing, and walking.\n\n\"The horse trainer should provide a safe environment for the horse where it can perform its normal activities and protect itself from injury. The trainer should consider the horse's age, gender, and condition and address those factors with the horse trainer. Additionally, trainers should monitor for changes in behavior or condition such as change in appetite or discomfort. A horse trainer must observe behavior and recognize behavior that may be indicative of a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\n\"The horse trainer should supervise the horse closely to ensure that the animal is not mistreated. The trainer should also consider that the owner has the right to train and use their horse in a manner that respects the animal's rights. If a problem is recognized during, or as a result of, a horse trainer's use of a horse, the trainer should immediately take effective and appropriate action that addresses the condition and concerns of the horse to avoid the occurrence of the situation in the future.\n\n\"The human's relationship with his or her horse is a personal one. The horse trainer should also pay close attention to the emotional relationship between the human and the horse, to the extent that it may involve the horse trainer's health and safety.\"\n\nCitation for the article:\n\nRabb, J.

{"id":1282,"ended":false,"length":714,"gen_text":"Honey has been used since ancient times to aid wound healing and may be beneficial in first- and second @ - @ degree burns. There is tentative evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness burn tissue in one or more of the following ways:It has been suggested that honey can help prevent tissue necrosis secondary to infection. It may be the case that the healing in the cut wound is slowed by the honey. In one study, honey has been tested for its effect on wound healing and found to be effective.\n\nA group lead by Dr. Suresh K Jyothi, a professor in the Department of Engineering & Technology, has proposed the use of honey in curing wound infections including skin wounds, surgical incisions and burns. Jyothi's team worked with Honey's Extracts for Derma Healing by Mihailo Popovicz, associate professor at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Zagreb. The extract is the product of extraction and is made from bee honey. It can be found in a number of local foods, such as honey-sweetened yogurt, frozen yogurt, fruit beverages.., etc. It can also be found on the internet.\n\nDr. Popovicz told Medical Daily, \"We tested honey (in vitro) for its influence on the healing of burn wounds. When we used 5% honey (in the wound), it had an impact on the healing process. We also observed decreased production of inflammatory cells and higher production of wound healing factors.\"\n\nAccording to research conducted by Dr. Popovicz as well, the honey can reduce inflammation and help healing. In a previous experimental testing, he demonstrated that when treated with a honey extract, skin wounds have a greater healing rate. He further stated that after honey is used for wound treatment, an improvement in the skin microenvironment is observed.\n\nJyothi's study evaluated the effect of 5% honey extract on a burn wound. He observed that honey extract enhanced nitric oxide production (HNO 3 ) production (a protective form of nitric oxide) and enhanced the activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by 72, which was linked to enhanced healing. The results of the initial wound tests did indicate that honey was effective with respect to reduced inflammation and healing, but further studies should be undertaken in this regard. When patients were given honey after treatment for burns, Dr. Popovicz has found that the skin treated with 10% honey extract had a greater healing ability over untreated skin.\n\nThe authors of the study, stated that \"These findings suggest new applications for this wound healing agent. They provide evidence that honey may have a role in treating burnt wounds, and increase the interest in the use of honey for wound management\".\n\nJyothi also shared that, \"Honey is also a good source of antioxidants, which can be used for treating infections.\n\n\"It is reported that honey possesses antimicrobial properties. In vitro studies have found honey may be useful in preventing and treating dental infections in the neonatal period, due to its antimicrobial properties.\"\n\nJyothi concluded his research by saying, \"Honey may have potential as an effective wound healing agent, particularly when used in combination with antioxidants, which have been shown to be useful in the treatment and prevention of infections, including those caused by bacteria.\"\n\nAs for the use of honey in cosmetic or household products, it is very unlikely that use of honey or the honey extract for dermal wound healing (which is similar to the use of honey in wound healing) would be detected by consumers. The Honey Extracts for Derma Healing are not widely available on the market and are highly expensive. Those who want to try honey for skin injury or other medical purposes can buy it by contacting Dr. Popovicz.\n\nImage Source: honey-honey-images\n\nWritten by: Catharine Paddock
