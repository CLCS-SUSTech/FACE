Domitian's great contribution to Rome was the victory over Antiochus, and the subsequent creation of the Domitian Family.","token_len":116,"entropy":[7.3551,7.2446,6.0022,3.7294,11.427,0.4154,0.0198,0.1712,0.1357,1.4709,4.7882,5.0287,0.6913,0.1062,0.9122,3.6306,1.6086,3.1256,8.2169,1.0325,1.6212,0.2519,3.9014,2.8952,3.2343,0.808,3.4796,4.4226,2.3789,0.9636,6.1458,0.8618,0.5031,4.048,0.0954,0.6274,6.5826,1.948,1.9688,4.4211,2.5974,0.6443,4.0336,0.1142,1.3505,4.8859,1.6374,0.5688,1.6893,0.0494,5.4639,2.9056,4.4359,4.1722,4.6775,0.0271,3.3077,1.732,0.057,5.5147,1.2915,5.353,4.4452,0.0005,0.249,2.3408,0.6786,5.3959,2.6855,4.1607,3.8978,1.8727,1.195,1.8962,4.168,3.0103,2.9959,3.6742,2.101,4.7049,5.7456,4.9105,5.8986,0.0027,0.001,0.4242,4.697,0.1036,0.6525,2.2371,0.001,0.001,1.2907,5.6288,3.7476,0.4907,3.0933,0.9391,0.8168,6.1255,0.7519,5.1811,0.0067,3.2567,2.306,1.3402,2.9805,3.5076,0.0158,0.4201,4.5765,0.4913,0.0144,5.0366,1.0274]}

Also in larger group it is hard to see the predators from the sides.\nWith this we saw that leks group activity and predator attack are related.\nIt is a very good idea to monitor your lek group and birds for predator attacks and for new signs or indications. The more you are aware of the danger of predators and the leks behavior, the better.\nIn case of danger the lek birds should be evacuated from the area for one or more hours. If you cannot do that safely then you must report to the park management immediately.","token_len":183,"entropy":[10.3001,9.7887,5.4892,7.3051,3.6895,1.4231,3.5541,4.2465,0.3151,4.279,0.0009,1.9794,2.8664,3.3995,2.4303,5.8182,1.2797,2.0343,3.0576,1.6642,5.9962,1.8494,2.4537,3.8603,2.6164,1.335,0.269,0.6098,5.497,2.3342,4.8171,1.186,0.6516,7.0078,1.8207,1.4095,2.9794,4.5849,1.2686,4.1751,1.5617,2.4691,2.8901,0.7516,2.4148,2.7287,1.5217,0.9396,1.1652,0.7576,1.6037,0.7503,3.6748,2.3977,4.4192,0.9635,4.3029,0.4918,0.5502,3.0571,2.7781,4.0493,5.7448,1.1215,1.162,1.2248,1.8031,0.6041,0.6628,0.9965,4.9173,2.2998,0.8991,3.3542,4.1969,0.2768,5.157,0.419,2.3942,1.5574,1.4852,2.5405,0.9682,4.7094,0.8071,1.7623,9.9231,3.1453,4.3815,5.1224,0.7594,3.4969,2.7376,6.1803,4.8219,2.3799,3.6219,5.1421,1.7936,2.5343,0.3788,2.3181,4.3469,0.6065,3.2976,2.763,2.1525,0.6283,0.1582,4.7044,1.5944,1.0744,0.1744,0.7599,2.4512,5.5892,3.3617,4.5653,1.6166,2.0542,3.5106,4.9405,4.9921,4.7605,5.4736,2.4473,3.3791,2.4113,1.6808,3.1566,0.6693,0.6202,0.9718,3.5405,2.5495,0.8662,2.02,0.9622,3.7447,1.0067,2.1074,1.342,0.1066,1.2009,1.625,1.0185,3.0364,3.3911,0.6711,2.6829,2.7085,1.5628,0.132,4.3317,1.1889,0.7508,2.3154,2.0968,0.1772,1.5856,5.3244,4.7613,1.7316,1.3851,1.7393,0.4527,2.2759,1.6941,3.3207,1.6877,1.2634,4.6674,2.1679,1.2914,2.543,4.8784,2.3376,0.5081,3.8638,3.7535,1.595,0.3394]}

However, the fact that the city is a megalopolis with lots of buildings has made it sink faster since those buildings are sinking while the ground is not because of the heat from the massive construction.\n\nThe city is actually sinking to the sea level, as evidenced by the following photos from the Daily Mail\n\nAnother reason for the sinking of the city and thus the water level is the presence of a huge gas pipeline running under the entire city that can give rise to a significant rise in ambient temperature that has caused it to sink. (For more details on this issue see The Case for Global Warming.) It has since been capped, with a plan to start working on an expansion to cap it later.\n\n(Visited 471 times, 1 visits today)\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle","token_len":193,"entropy":[11.222,2.7715,5.5264,0.0333,1.1665,3.0999,0.0024,0.4413,0.975,0.2814,2.4841,0.5613,8.9534,3.9535,0.2081,4.7696,4.8217,5.7797,0.9292,6.7431,0.7767,0.0606,0.2847,0.8778,5.6585,0.0452,1.2144,5.5575,0.1061,0.8392,2.2937,1.1287,4.0851,7.6374,0.055,0.3673,2.7615,5.5159,0.029,2.12,3.232,1.8213,0.5654,3.5918,1.4319,6.0018,5.8324,0.9401,1.0231,2.811,6.0192,0.3368,2.7741,0.9091,1.9593,7.3338,0.6313,0.634,5.1212,1.7119,0.1769,5.557,3.4211,0.9009,0.9398,0.0472,1.5857,2.2045,1.311,4.4538,1.539,4.6703,1.0626,4.5878,1.4515,1.7553,3.4412,2.9385,0.0954,0.5605,4.3275,3.3129,2.6275,1.3166,5.2806,0.2373,4.734,0.0002,5.3298,3.5243,1.4104,0.2524,1.0652,1.0104,0.4838,0.3031,4.5234,6.8516,0.5407,3.4798,1.0269,0.7427,0.8998,4.0574,0.0064,1.7616,2.7143,4.7344,1.43,2.49,2.3557,0.1663,5.4116,0.1772,3.0915,4.4835,5.7802,3.3866,0.0038,1.4594,4.6489,2.6205,0.0634,6.4574,0.896,4.1907,3.3267,2.0354,5.2842,0.0179,0.9862,0.7123,5.6062,4.7317,0.644,2.0688,1.1104,0.927,3.2051,1.5543,3.3322,5.2026,1.3738,1.6479,0.0362,0.0,2.4103,6.2352,2.0721,5.1017,0.0923,4.1058,1.9657,4.652,2.255,3.8711,0.4019,3.9936,4.5266,0.0807,3.701,3.4064,2.5075,5.1108,0.6005,4.1381,0.9877,0.3732,0.0002,4.6289,4.0919,0.0001,3.1004,5.6539,0.0126,0.0005,0.0687,0.0001,0.0001,0.0003,2.614,0.0002,0.8142,0.1063,0.0062,1.2188,0.0004,0.0003,0.2989,0.0086,0.0002,0.0965]}
