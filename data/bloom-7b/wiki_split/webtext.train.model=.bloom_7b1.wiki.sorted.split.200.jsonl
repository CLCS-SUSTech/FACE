In Japanese, the same translation as for the English version is used. Since the English localization is done by Capcom's international English localization team, it is possible that some of the translations are not exact, particularly in terms of the use of slang. At the time of the release of Ace Attorney 1 (2007), a new game type, the \"Games for Android\" appeared in Japan, where they were developed by GameSoft and distributed for phones as a software download rather than through traditional game cartridges. This game type has no language restrictions, and is available for nearly all Android phones. After it first appeared, many more similar types of games were released, many of them with no localization to the English language. In 2008, many of them were translated by the fans.","token_len":203,"entropy":[4.3062,9.5458,3.2252,0.4858,0.8518,1.6778,6.6356,17.4326,9.9364,1.3722,0.9625,5.007,0.3339,12.3063,4.981,3.4821,9.5858,5.7921,2.4116,1.3915,3.2529,4.6535,5.3616,2.569,4.4298,0.7315,1.6402,3.3923,0.1309,1.7555,4.0591,9.5973,0.0233,4.0184,1.6098,0.6313,8.5394,5.8115,1.6794,0.727,8.7252,1.6485,1.6362,5.4231,0.174,1.0781,4.3675,5.3136,0.3659,2.938,6.8933,0.2317,1.3133,5.8425,6.7905,3.7743,2.8826,1.1849,2.6033,1.3611,2.5652,1.8897,2.1421,4.6969,1.3553,3.6283,2.6827,1.6261,3.4492,1.0503,3.7908,1.8868,5.5087,6.0529,3.3077,0.5721,0.2354,1.8881,1.0667,2.0265,1.4911,2.7157,1.1612,0.2212,5.0923,2.4107,2.3937,5.2239,1.5824,5.3119,2.2495,2.7061,0.0011,1.6944,5.922,0.0363,6.5364,1.4992,5.929,0.8288,1.498,0.4695,1.3725,3.1039,0.1915,1.549,0.001,5.2613,3.946,3.4798,0.2342,3.9138,3.502,4.022,6.0801,2.2973,2.3828,2.9736,8.3727,2.8531,5.2974,0.5157,6.6276,1.6434,1.635,1.0395,3.311,3.8518,0.7831,4.3002,0.576,6.1997,6.6333,1.9279,4.8517,3.9698,6.5111,4.7453,2.4034,5.3907,3.3644,6.5361,0.0063,4.92,4.9242,2.9673,3.3694,0.2986,3.0041,2.2793,1.1917,2.4685,4.7852,4.8461,3.4123,1.0482,1.3023,1.8313,3.4848,1.4946,7.5076,0.3582,1.9817,1.1375,1.2741,5.2526,5.0447,5.2666,0.6323,1.6805,3.401,5.0589,7.6028,5.4936,1.028,0.2516,0.6268,0.9351,1.1861,4.6542,0.3415,1.841,2.6853,3.4763,3.0515,4.4824,2.473,2.6536,1.3888,0.4902,2.5701,4.2363,0.1013,5.2511,1.4111,2.8423,0.6907,3.2032,2.4438,2.4004,7.9585,2.4011]}

He used so-called `` spiking `` neurons - called simple spike oscillators - to perform computations that appeared to have no prior logic behind them. The net was fed with a very simple series of spikes and it appeared to have learned to generate seemingly complex sequences out of the input it was given. For instance, given this input :\nThe net would `` decode `` it into this sequence of outputs :\nAnd then Hopfield came up with the name `` feed forward `` to describe this type of learning. The network used the weights between the neurons to learn how to decode the input given to it. The weights were the same for all synapses connecting a given neuron to another ; the neurons had a large number of these weights, and these large numbers of weights led directly to the enormous computational power that the net possessed.","token_len":204,"entropy":[10.2634,0.2639,9.0683,3.3667,9.2296,5.3699,2.9624,4.1667,0.0109,3.5248,0.4293,2.8174,6.9228,0.0787,7.2347,2.7059,3.9116,13.6371,1.1717,2.546,10.4728,16.9817,0.1729,5.2007,5.7305,2.3539,2.0515,3.9891,3.4513,2.932,0.9355,2.2972,1.2371,6.0496,2.2156,0.1207,0.5774,2.565,3.6198,8.7199,0.1255,0.0009,1.0611,10.0737,0.9702,2.224,3.9123,6.3405,6.0205,7.7295,6.4146,6.3639,0.0996,0.6496,0.5115,4.8743,4.816,0.0459,1.9095,5.8125,0.3769,3.3745,2.2465,2.9727,7.3828,4.2286,0.232,0.2651,2.3162,5.4088,1.6845,7.5854,3.2886,2.5608,5.5178,1.9205,5.4179,0.0174,4.1715,2.3941,3.6385,5.7159,0.6499,2.3774,1.7139,2.2632,3.7757,7.7967,4.1608,4.8279,7.3292,0.0061,2.3761,5.4285,6.5757,1.8121,2.8434,0.2176,5.0723,3.2996,0.0556,5.7343,5.2441,2.8275,7.6072,1.9551,5.6013,2.0537,3.1566,8.9733,9.3372,4.6731,5.4157,2.826,5.7373,2.2017,1.5206,6.9871,2.125,0.3773,3.0217,2.6221,8.0031,0.0046,5.9886,0.1275,0.007,1.1651,6.3489,0.6556,8.3614,9.2015,1.2938,2.8951,1.0203,2.8016,4.3226,0.0101,3.5057,0.6241,2.0257,3.9138,4.7894,1.8644,8.2069,6.3866,1.2413,4.8675,0.6132,3.4469,2.4301,0.6288,5.1976,0.8836,1.5405,7.499,2.0333,0.3598,0.7027,1.6809,2.9818,0.9763,4.7914,1.4305,1.865,1.0479,9.4633,0.0458,8.4214,3.0122,4.1392,1.1119,0.5994,2.9016,8.1906,1.8223,3.7377,3.652,2.6785,5.7983,0.8792,0.0459,6.2064,4.1683,1.9628,1.1901,4.5944,5.4289,0.7751,0.8189,2.4184,4.0586,5.6383,0.0919,0.7889,9.8405,4.6137,0.7369,2.2256,1.9,1.7388,6.0842,0.2128]}

Some episodes from The Next Generation (DS9) were set in the star system, but not the Federation.\nHowever, after several more interviews, he was convinced that the actor was a good one and there was nothing that could be done to convince him otherwise, so he agreed to direct the episode.","token_len":208,"entropy":[7.1654,0.0134,8.5525,3.3506,6.4665,1.3721,0.95,8.196,0.9871,2.7478,7.1841,8.4542,4.1141,3.457,0.5682,2.6443,1.2233,3.8447,2.8343,1.8622,1.4528,2.953,6.8899,0.0154,0.0032,1.1255,11.1222,3.7086,5.5065,7.7941,2.8647,0.0034,0.1312,1.9737,2.4936,0.2009,1.0475,1.1317,1.931,2.006,4.2152,0.6134,1.6058,2.3284,3.4828,2.4496,6.2207,4.7659,0.808,8.1921,2.1295,1.8275,6.2447,2.009,1.7871,2.3407,4.0849,1.1358,6.3157,2.5153,2.6991,1.9376,1.8567,5.2489,1.5684,1.3391,10.4284,14.0063,2.2672,6.7271,1.5158,4.5611,3.4036,3.3299,3.9717,1.0176,3.6229,0.2695,0.0011,2.1513,1.6504,1.7989,0.5121,5.7476,0.2066,0.7807,12.2523,0.9863,0.0027,2.6678,1.2248,0.4811,1.305,2.8736,2.2345,5.1173,6.1609,0.8994,0.8703,7.4605,1.803,6.0382,2.7865,0.006,0.0003,2.0649,4.9559,0.0005,2.2379,6.4216,4.1764,0.567,5.3117,8.1799,2.8532,2.8938,4.0637,2.1328,4.3256,3.0219,2.0114,0.9698,2.14,0.0051,2.7532,1.6889,5.4842,4.2085,2.82,3.028,0.9716,8.4625,1.3922,0.0098,1.4434,2.7608,2.3431,2.7118,7.064,0.8764,4.74,0.6203,2.4761,5.6371,4.1496,0.6072,6.7446,6.3734,5.3809,3.3107,0.1655,0.0014,4.603,7.8696,0.0082,1.2891,1.7411,3.8129,0.7169,1.4268,6.9167,1.2323,1.9655,1.9242,4.5159,2.1518,4.2078,1.3151,1.1463,5.3053,0.0505,3.8251,3.9119,4.634,4.0438,1.0349,4.2853,1.2062,3.7188,0.8769,1.5781,3.9651,2.1179,2.6757,3.2968,4.7992,1.9178,6.1338,0.3882,2.8893,3.1582,0.7994,0.6519,0.1018,1.1772,3.3464,0.4316,1.2962,2.3479,1.8099,0.3762,3.4636,0.1178,4.3338,1.4233,0.7819,0.885]}

The construction of Highway 401 across the province brought an end of the need for most of the steamers on the Niagara River at this point. Highway 407 across the Rideau Pass between Kingston and Ottawa was also completed and the highway through Montreal was completed as was Highway 30 to Kingston.\nThe construction of Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1870s provided the basis for construction of a Trans-Canada Railway through Ontario from Hamilton on the Trans-Canada Railway to Montreal with a branch through Toronto. This was completed in the late 1880s with a third branch through Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario.\nAlthough there had been a number of attempts to build a railway to the Gulf of St. Lawrence by building bridges across the Niagara River to Niagara-on-the-Lake and Niagara, none of these had done so. Thus it was decided to build a bridge across the Niagara River at the mouth of the Niagara River.","token_len":209,"entropy":[6.774,1.3627,0.8274,8.3741,0.1584,8.7459,0.1291,0.6134,7.0166,6.8239,0.0788,15.8171,1.9945,1.5105,10.9972,10.2053,2.0848,10.8083,1.3213,6.6798,8.5286,1.0427,2.5186,0.1176,0.048,2.7264,0.175,0.7471,2.1993,4.6077,0.3904,4.4799,3.4541,6.2687,0.6929,3.5248,5.2126,3.6974,0.4101,6.865,1.3237,4.6855,0.1838,7.7275,1.7307,0.346,8.2675,3.2027,3.3984,0.6015,7.1291,1.0808,4.8575,3.5196,1.7651,1.0005,4.4061,2.8527,6.7409,0.3352,8.4128,0.0011,9.6402,4.6744,5.0021,0.1303,3.9586,1.568,4.3232,1.2733,4.0244,1.9906,4.5825,6.7307,4.8358,1.0347,1.22,3.7692,4.912,1.0084,5.2758,3.9695,5.6957,0.6661,1.5104,2.9062,4.0756,0.086,5.898,3.7534,0.7134,2.8284,1.7892,4.1573,0.2813,3.4916,1.3936,3.1645,0.0791,5.6535,0.2812,2.7439,6.319,0.6086,0.4997,3.1219,3.8673,2.8036,4.6944,4.8843,4.9299,1.3459,6.7324,0.1842,0.0722,2.1009,0.9899,3.2256,4.6754,1.9642,5.5891,4.1825,2.6018,0.8611,2.8335,1.7465,2.175,0.6421,2.2497,2.4834,1.065,0.1416,2.6468,1.8767,6.0354,0.9786,2.5813,4.7602,0.4761,1.9676,6.6305,0.9767,1.05,1.4682,5.3182,3.3398,3.7219,0.1396,1.7175,2.9222,0.012,3.7283,0.6253,1.4602,1.3893,2.0227,2.5723,0.9954,4.5929,0.7565,2.6636,0.1714,0.0096,3.9277,5.9804,3.5771,2.1479,0.5312,2.4391,0.3758,3.0153,4.4765,5.7244,1.9941,0.0069,0.5183,0.0154,0.7459,2.4832,3.2135,5.3061,3.3776,0.8269,0.5407,2.9203,5.3579,0.5939,1.2407,5.3966,3.6126,0.5699,2.0144,0.8596,0.846,0.5884,2.5928,1.4308,0.2785,1.2904,0.3747,3.7432,1.4798,4.3591,0.0143,0.565,2.1564,0.3873,1.8779]}

Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical properties, such as bones and muscles. Some animals and plants produce proteins with special properties that function like chemicals (e.g., enzymes), medicines, foods, or hormones.\nProteins are important for the cell\u2019s normal functions; their activity is necessary for the development of the embryo, the normal growth and development of the body, protein synthesis in specific cells and organs, or response to environmental factors, such as temperature or pollution.\nThe body needs about 50 g of protein a day. This depends on how old you are, how active you are, and the gender of the person.\nThe consumption of proteins has grown rapidly in the last few decades. This is due to the food habits of young people, who prefer to eat more prepared food rather than fresh fruit or vegetables. This increases the demand for milk and meat products.","token_len":210,"entropy":[10.1186,0.3123,2.3367,4.7395,2.0585,4.0995,0.0895,7.3747,0.532,1.0993,5.9867,2.4279,8.6823,1.7656,0.8153,5.0205,1.9044,1.6989,0.6071,5.4952,2.0844,1.095,7.2915,1.2648,3.4233,0.0578,1.3668,4.1241,0.1739,2.5315,9.1127,0.827,5.9288,0.7166,3.2522,5.982,3.515,4.9196,0.9047,1.8793,1.2912,0.0014,9.845,1.4571,2.9906,0.3969,2.9729,6.7091,2.95,0.7464,2.7388,2.1931,3.3229,5.051,0.6212,2.3686,6.5512,2.9842,6.1665,4.4928,1.5355,0.0003,0.0003,0.1456,3.1551,3.8991,9.6186,0.9889,6.0096,0.3689,1.6771,4.5745,0.2592,1.4615,15.1451,0.1661,0.0056,0.8672,4.3983,0.8084,1.8232,4.7243,15.0443,7.721,5.2515,5.9284,1.6652,4.9083,3.1942,3.6749,1.1958,5.3394,0.661,1.3909,3.0972,0.2232,2.8609,5.5844,1.1824,2.177,4.9255,2.742,1.7833,0.5292,0.1612,0.4321,2.0871,0.2084,7.6582,0.1117,4.7104,6.3964,2.5126,3.5429,3.4183,0.1047,4.5677,8.1354,0.1785,2.4952,2.4857,2.7656,0.5753,0.002,3.1407,2.5089,6.215,0.2158,1.247,2.6437,3.5167,4.9377,4.7206,3.6061,6.8058,0.3519,0.8694,2.5469,0.0314,2.3474,3.4642,5.3748,0.1375,2.7061,5.5542,2.0456,0.0256,0.8656,0.8401,3.802,0.3722,0.0671,0.3412,0.8504,1.7603,9.1125,0.3106,1.2168,2.1349,2.6651,2.0385,2.237,8.9252,0.058,3.0291,3.2602,6.862,1.6489,0.9374,0.5869,1.243,1.8616,0.2741,0.7805,3.962,1.8172,1.4132,0.4561,1.0002,6.3238,7.245,0.4369,4.2647,0.8781,1.2468,2.787,4.0843,1.1435,0.7436,2.8992,7.5646,2.962,4.763,0.0143,3.5937,4.7922,2.0532,0.1037,0.3032,3.2664,4.0866,0.4301,3.0887,0.1054,7.3203,1.0538,3.7189,2.808,1.0587]}

There is tentative evidence that honey helps heal partial thickness and deep burns. Some studies show that the moisturizing properties of honey make it an excellent treatment for psoriasis. Honey is also a great soothing substance during and after periods of stress, depression, and trauma. As an anti inflammatory agent, honey helps manage and treat arthritis, as well as some other inflammatory conditions.\nIt also has an antibiotic action.

During this time, the storm spawned a series of storms and heavy rain across Yemen.\nThe remnants also touched the northwest coast of Qatar on July 31. The storm continued on and affected Oman, where heavy precipitation dumped up to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm), Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.  Another remnant made landfall near Kuwait on August 24.  A tropical storm passed through Kuwait a few days afterward. Most rains fell overnight.\nThe storm's remnants did not make landfall in the United States until the next day near the Cape Verde Islands, where it produced heavy rain.","token_len":213,"entropy":[11.1125,8.5717,1.8282,10.6051,3.9754,3.7392,3.3832,3.34,0.6084,6.3486,3.9646,3.4556,0.2603,8.5782,1.2203,2.8544,7.7287,5.2744,2.3035,2.0717,3.1346,4.514,1.2976,2.0442,0.1484,2.2984,4.2722,1.0474,2.2437,1.2902,2.7146,6.1665,1.5537,7.0167,6.3251,6.4377,1.5925,0.1186,4.9469,4.3437,0.0689,0.2639,8.9666,1.7261,15.7318,2.0315,2.0986,3.2444,3.2271,1.1221,0.3211,0.0125,0.5347,2.9672,5.3124,3.3271,10.2911,0.5725,5.7863,2.4866,0.7601,1.2109,4.0875,0.9817,3.2756,1.7284,2.8893,2.6378,2.0941,0.2124,1.9491,6.0492,0.1245,0.7239,5.1904,0.1341,7.7598,3.5115,0.7115,6.4316,0.1041,1.745,2.2383,4.3417,5.629,4.0905,0.871,5.3465,5.9655,0.3389,4.6207,0.0075,7.2603,6.8449,4.1326,1.0427,4.6443,1.4729,0.6256,0.2103,1.1582,2.6136,5.7941,1.3731,3.2926,0.0013,3.0774,2.6767,5.0504,1.8884,3.5546,4.5134,1.1921,2.7661,2.0262,4.929,6.4172,6.0858,2.2032,5.4151,0.521,0.0784,5.9029,2.1311,2.8066,4.1012,0.7206,1.7656,2.0955,3.9121,3.7141,5.1135,6.5189,5.9045,1.3839,3.7851,5.3531,4.7214,5.6618,4.3583,0.0337,4.5057,0.2646,0.5843,5.8993,2.9263,1.3651,3.8748,8.1699,0.2092,1.136,1.0063,5.2268,0.5749,6.8817,14.1696,6.4992,4.6338,0.1113,3.4052,4.5564,0.44,0.8666,3.9939,0.5405,3.0328,3.3721,3.9732,0.5181,5.4768,1.4421,3.0536,4.6448,1.4306,0.3998,7.0784,1.0792,6.6263,8.6342,2.7565,5.3512,1.9179,1.5237,1.5907,2.7492,3.2044,3.1709,5.0542,0.2517,3.3841,0.2438,1.1429,1.2587,2.1832,0.2119,0.4337,3.103,3.0078,0.7243,7.9291,1.638,4.8332,1.8357,0.0003,0.6351,1.9404,1.8391,0.8139,6.3662,3.245,1.3267,1.3531]}

When this is put into the context that the US burns 7.5 million homes each year, the potential damage is enormous.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the health insurance industry has attempted to use that fact to get their way about expanding the coverage of the medical bills for burn cases. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) has tried to limit coverage of treatment for burn cases. Even though HIPAA was intended to help individuals in their fight against health insurance companies, HIPAA has helped to make insurance companies stronger by creating new reasons for refusal to accept claims for treatments. The HIPAA legislation gave insurance companies a list of reasons why they may refuse service to a particular patient.","token_len":213,"entropy":[2.6222,4.9428,0.0679,0.2762,8.9116,3.1803,9.4115,7.017,1.0786,2.979,1.3365,0.5429,4.3361,0.0706,4.2738,1.3317,6.1376,12.3808,0.8287,3.0758,3.9359,0.5203,2.358,0.7566,8.8674,3.7055,4.9229,6.8622,2.7821,4.7566,7.0493,1.5748,4.0032,0.218,2.3301,2.1954,4.2119,1.6775,6.1724,8.964,6.2198,0.1297,3.1726,0.2608,0.8778,4.7174,1.5264,5.98,0.7173,0.3409,6.3668,0.3006,3.8137,0.1503,0.692,1.4151,6.0363,0.0441,2.2964,2.7711,0.9176,0.407,6.7502,0.0078,0.4098,2.1441,6.4256,0.2128,5.7913,5.4108,2.1475,5.9451,0.8997,3.964,0.315,6.4933,2.1456,4.1952,3.705,4.7238,1.4595,1.6144,0.4924,4.2393,1.6239,0.0659,0.2132,1.777,5.9499,4.6122,2.2008,2.6541,0.2916,1.3691,10.434,16.3386,7.5519,1.108,4.7336,1.1446,0.379,1.7344,5.3823,4.9462,1.4148,1.8687,5.9961,0.0572,4.0963,5.2707,3.8234,0.4478,5.3106,3.2444,2.7498,6.776,5.4412,1.9327,2.7828,0.8627,2.9696,5.2459,4.8657,2.9733,5.8897,7.5708,0.3935,2.4679,5.1083,0.092,1.2696,4.2865,0.7789,1.4603,0.0002,0.0014,0.003,0.0036,1.2964,6.0793,0.0437,0.5205,2.5846,6.272,0.0978,3.7111,2.6725,1.414,7.1244,1.1182,1.0408,1.1755,1.679,5.3287,1.2824,2.5774,0.0044,2.9047,4.0638,0.1638,3.3617,4.7895,4.0086,2.8077,7.528,0.6323,3.5788,0.918,2.7129,0.5239,4.4655,0.0084,1.6488,5.8228,2.1659,3.3388,3.6425,1.0415,6.623,2.4395,4.1717,2.7777,8.4385,0.662,5.78,0.5362,4.4778,2.6247,1.6685,4.7849,1.6465,2.4527,3.9869,0.0015,3.3672,6.905,2.0507,0.0674,2.0363,7.075,0.0382,2.4386,1.8207,0.4983,4.4988,0.9777,4.7497,0.5069,2.0025,4.3465,0.4599,1.2181]}

Dunham began practicing basketball drills late at night after graduating from St. Joseph\u2019s school district where he was an all -District MVP. He has shown tremendous promise as a freshman but is poised for an even bigger season. One of the most impressive strengths of this rising star is the drive which he possesses to excel in all situations. Dunham has shown that he intends to make it to the top of his class. His drive and enthusiasm will only be limited by his own talents. Dunham will be the type of defensive player who will work tirelessly on the offensive end to help his team win the battle of the boards. The size is also one of the many characteristics which Dunham possesses along with superior court vision and a skillful stroke. He can shoot the ball from virtually any position on the court and possesses a very good sense of timing.

Although Hewitt continued to outplay Federer in a number of semi-finals and finals throughout the rest of their careers, he lost twice in their match at the 1999 Masters.\nIn February 2003, Hewitt suffered a broken wrist on his dominant hand, preventing him from playing for the rest of the year. Two weeks later, Hewitt underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair the same wrist. Returning in 2004, Hewitt was one of two players to win the Aegon All England Club Tennis Championships at Wimbledon along with Andy Murray. In the second week of the 2004 US Open, Hewitt defeated defending champion Roger Federer in straight sets for his first Major title. He entered the 2004 French Open as a high-flyer, but in the first round he lost to Rafael Nadal in four sets.","token_len":214,"entropy":[8.3086,1.5789,4.7234,0.4346,3.3351,6.7078,4.1972,0.0305,5.6785,4.1052,0.0503,2.2129,8.4964,2.0158,2.1007,9.6236,0.7354,2.1688,0.8422,0.274,2.7193,0.0005,5.5986,6.0834,0.0005,2.2673,3.2003,3.6843,1.1107,2.0564,1.964,1.4906,6.7991,1.8732,1.9001,1.167,3.8812,7.3796,6.2288,2.1432,4.7657,1.1403,1.1958,5.7244,0.0169,4.3855,0.5047,0.9665,6.0024,3.2111,0.0009,5.6841,0.3459,5.5859,1.9847,0.4517,0.0002,1.7413,3.7414,1.5111,0.0014,5.631,0.0202,1.0949,1.7259,2.3753,4.2267,1.4564,3.3956,0.0003,2.938,0.8,0.0697,1.2951,3.9092,5.8387,0.9421,3.3488,5.1892,2.6129,1.5794,4.5229,3.207,1.0211,0.82,12.5342,6.0014,3.1318,0.1114,0.6156,0.002,4.7288,0.34,1.9004,2.5308,3.6573,1.6299,7.318,5.1819,2.5137,6.5478,0.1225,0.0418,1.131,3.1451,0.8225,2.9139,0.0003,0.3981,1.406,0.2675,5.3616,1.4198,0.1207,0.1342,2.197,0.0023,3.9411,5.4666,0.0063,0.0141,0.1037,0.221,0.944,0.3974,0.9767,4.8539,4.321,1.2528,9.3315,3.5306,4.5508,0.2023,0.7847,0.0041,2.0299,4.0532,0.0901,2.7634,0.8495,0.7514,1.8627,1.217,11.2334,5.3374,8.7071,6.379,3.2633,4.8759,2.1313,3.738,1.2581,0.0,8.7085,0.0091,4.7841,0.1329,1.2452,2.3875,2.0694,4.3652,4.6653,0.1181,1.5296,3.3712,3.2361,0.0477,0.5251,0.3611,0.0023,3.7907,8.8904,0.4753,2.3259,0.0108,0.0001,1.6005,8.5776,0.0296,4.9097,2.4551,1.4205,6.2174,0.5589,0.8347,2.829,6.2376,0.3424,2.9091,6.0408,0.0126,1.5602,1.7974,7.387,0.6098,4.8061,0.3658,1.0394,1.2129,3.6055,1.1493,3.0164,1.2625,1.7284,1.8058,1.2719,4.1146,0.0019,0.0002,0.9902,4.5495,0.3542,0.8741]}

In England, John Forster, John Brown and George Eliot were the leading figures in their genres.","token_len":215,"entropy":[11.059,0.6647,12.5195,1.3934,7.3207,7.4223,1.5963,5.2154,1.2032,0.8322,3.8128,11.5698,11.7218,1.0157,1.5665,0.0002,7.5152,1.5649,10.3418,0.0401,3.7312,6.9946,12.1125,15.7447,1.1806,1.244,9.658,4.8566,4.1048,2.9376,1.7569,4.967,0.0307,0.4185,3.5903,9.4479,7.0453,0.0601,5.7192,3.7795,0.7491,6.7945,3.9656,1.545,7.8938,6.4752,2.1638,3.5249,7.0469,1.964,5.701,4.6892,4.8786,4.2546,0.8911,3.093,4.369,4.6597,2.1471,7.6981,5.3471,0.9912,0.4122,2.7708,0.0836,5.4053,2.094,2.4798,4.8184,0.0269,3.1729,3.189,5.6537,2.3785,4.6245,5.2775,4.5188,0.3874,3.4903,2.969,2.4329,5.9763,2.0924,4.061,2.7268,2.2067,3.0722,1.3323,1.1264,0.8957,7.5864,0.1784,5.2066,4.9746,0.932,7.0951,8.6744,1.2367,0.3757,1.3949,3.5783,4.6315,5.495,5.706,1.9787,2.8832,4.7831,2.0864,4.8515,1.3252,4.0671,0.0406,1.5787,2.0293,2.7087,5.6891,4.5172,1.0559,3.457,0.0225,0.5791,3.0887,4.4977,1.0686,1.536,2.4562,2.6328,5.8574,3.788,0.9899,1.5343,6.0345,2.3407,0.7423,5.497,5.3321,0.1892,0.0718,1.3636,3.584,5.4493,0.7649,0.7696,3.4706,2.7542,1.8213,2.8489,0.3886,0.778,4.5606,1.365,3.1953,2.486,5.757,0.1268,5.8944,7.4673,2.0608,1.2859,5.089,6.6778,3.0592,3.7576,0.4638,3.8273,3.3117,3.2049,5.893,4.657,3.5642,3.2808,1.1027,0.2939,2.7207,5.3734,1.5875,8.8531,2.9571,1.767,0.0058,1.3938,3.6575,6.3082,1.1256,1.6208,4.4653,2.1226,1.8827,1.8664,1.2713,2.6679,1.0287,5.2446,1.1925,2.894,4.3115,0.4618,6.0641,8.3294,0.5422,1.5999,4.8115,5.5786,1.9079,4.2701,4.8342,1.4335,2.6531,3.668,4.7466,0.6808,4.9467,5.5004,0.8024]}

Seaweed ( Botryodentrophyceae ) is the dominant feature of the benthic community, with a further few species occurring on the hard substrate. The species are similar in nature to those of other Atlantic continental shelves. On the other hand, there are three types of soft substrate macro algae in the locality that are either absent from, or extremely scarce in, northern temperate Atlantic countries. They are: Cystoseira, a monospecific genus from Iceland ; Gelidium, an uncommon but widespread species from Scandinavia; and a species of Desmarestia from Norway that occurs on the shores of Sweden and Germany. However, at the present day these species are restricted to northern latitudes and are replaced in southern countries by the more prevalent species. It is expected that these three species will become increasingly prevalent in the Isle of Portland in the future.","token_len":215,"entropy":[2.0517,3.8818,9.6837,9.5549,1.6416,0.3969,1.1657,7.7208,0.2019,10.7601,1.8457,3.6074,2.7342,4.5343,0.0397,5.1559,0.2787,0.0044,0.0004,11.2757,2.5902,6.2903,4.1015,9.8581,1.4899,6.5091,0.0118,1.7193,7.5396,0.653,9.3509,0.7409,3.4765,5.2153,0.4848,1.0744,7.9526,1.4973,1.9119,3.7924,11.6998,2.1312,7.267,7.7849,5.426,2.0681,6.5398,4.9063,0.4725,1.5063,2.0019,4.5784,6.5785,0.6888,0.5383,7.6331,1.6919,0.1539,5.7574,1.8357,1.8593,2.2054,6.6925,4.581,1.1952,4.2767,2.2766,0.6783,8.8202,3.9889,1.0957,1.7427,3.7098,2.1051,6.277,1.2075,5.9046,0.2942,1.9692,1.0338,2.3367,8.0293,8.1195,8.2413,1.9993,5.3969,0.7006,2.7588,0.182,0.0348,3.8979,0.398,4.2907,4.2058,0.0716,6.9324,2.2984,10.4873,6.9866,3.8384,0.6152,7.8883,4.5621,1.3306,6.9152,4.1065,2.1461,7.0545,0.2592,5.8938,4.4616,1.1398,0.4446,6.9147,7.2084,0.0018,4.6854,6.6776,0.5902,3.903,0.6621,4.0343,6.8763,2.8279,6.4589,10.1254,2.8368,3.7734,6.1339,4.0489,4.3098,0.0293,5.7359,4.9994,5.9627,4.2519,8.6033,7.3346,0.3096,2.4647,4.0142,4.8023,3.828,1.3553,1.06,5.5615,0.0006,2.2589,0.3732,5.1597,2.7392,1.2277,10.3439,8.1641,4.1021,1.756,1.7138,4.4547,5.161,3.006,1.8752,0.9144,5.605,0.0552,7.3241,1.4475,4.7717,0.3011,5.3837,0.03,5.4966,1.3333,3.1281,3.8875,4.1924,1.6758,0.4492,3.9191,0.2827,4.9902,4.8587,0.0023,1.7713,1.5889,7.2398,3.6755,5.8002,4.8906,0.2356,2.565,3.7057,4.9283,3.2419,3.7896,4.3895,0.3053,4.9333,0.0687,2.5796,3.2951,0.8686,0.4641,3.1075,2.8515,2.6025,1.0222,0.6528,5.198,0.1062,0.1202,2.3893,0.2221,1.0068,0.5819]}

Prior to the start of the 1927 \u2013 28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal netting. Instead of using the traditional wooden or iron barriers as a goal post, each net was a closed structure. The concept was designed by architect David Collins. Following this change, the teams began to alter their style of play around open net goals. As more and more teams adopted the open net concept, the league saw a growth in their popularity.\nIn the late 1920s, the Chicago Black Hawks took an interest in a player named John Ross. Ross was a former student of the University of Pittsburgh, which had hosted the Stanley Cup for the past 14 seasons. Under the leadership of John Daly, who coached the Black Hawks for over three decades, the Black Hawks had the opportunity to have their players visit the school in order to gain some experience with the game of hockey. On the day the Black Hawks arrived at U of P, John F. Ross was there to greet his old friends.","token_len":215,"entropy":[4.2806,3.6162,5.8416,2.2223,5.3097,0.2541,7.0284,3.1573,6.577,0.0288,6.5256,2.8402,2.1372,2.2174,7.4107,0.0037,2.2371,4.5032,0.0142,0.7495,11.0447,9.5763,2.767,0.5888,0.5937,2.9466,5.2616,5.7502,1.1153,1.7084,4.8876,0.1764,5.2826,9.3214,0.9108,1.5358,5.1029,0.0023,2.6562,1.7247,2.9202,7.1861,5.692,4.4844,7.6985,4.472,2.5502,1.3558,3.7971,0.2368,5.6268,3.6989,0.9776,3.4492,7.0789,5.259,2.082,1.5899,7.7033,0.965,4.9616,3.105,5.1743,4.7647,7.2706,1.9467,6.5749,3.5158,4.2397,0.4877,1.2602,5.8319,2.5202,0.8733,5.9765,0.8259,3.5012,0.6846,2.0817,5.8755,8.325,1.4911,4.6366,0.6053,4.2667,4.6053,2.0667,0.0015,1.5865,2.2103,0.5948,4.4528,0.7134,2.8571,0.1282,1.2936,3.7127,5.1916,1.7459,5.5362,0.1817,4.1378,4.2572,0.4777,1.499,9.0071,2.0615,2.5087,1.1255,0.2402,0.3133,1.4912,4.3654,6.4026,0.9564,4.3967,4.0295,0.6904,0.0917,3.1153,5.5707,1.0334,3.9257,4.4309,0.523,0.7064,1.1857,1.1812,3.2889,5.1305,0.3589,1.7223,3.158,0.0069,3.9154,1.966,4.1252,1.8508,4.8222,1.1177,4.9741,0.0148,4.6133,0.9368,3.3474,4.8883,2.1545,0.1612,6.7376,1.43,1.7714,0.0062,4.1531,8.0115,0.2086,3.6866,4.2524,1.0232,1.5521,0.0705,2.1664,3.2906,3.4632,0.1599,0.1813,1.1168,1.4611,0.0145,3.4194,3.7168,2.424,0.0313,5.188,2.3192,4.8236,7.8133,0.9795,6.0429,2.5182,2.4893,0.0263,2.9641,3.1262,0.9561,1.8362,0.5476,1.5474,2.7412,0.2965,0.083,4.9337,2.152,2.0481,2.3121,1.0147,0.0061,3.3749,1.1993,6.8285,2.4802,0.2548,0.4196,3.214,7.1955,0.7285,0.1206,1.5935,3.1946,1.2404,2.2099,2.9817,3.8668,3.4969,0.7078]}

It became a part of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900.","token_len":215,"entropy":[8.8118,8.772,12.1065,4.7989,1.504,11.0822,3.7261,1.5039,8.6186,4.3448,3.4117,0.56,7.4667,10.2314,0.9856,2.758,1.5513,6.3304,2.3994,3.4072,8.4498,3.2403,5.5315,1.1067,6.576,5.8559,0.9267,2.8381,4.7161,1.5267,1.1384,6.9654,1.7026,9.4769,1.0558,0.9853,2.1348,0.6079,2.6102,5.0241,3.0716,2.4022,0.8907,1.1756,8.4332,7.0692,0.8539,3.721,0.9005,5.4707,0.2744,1.3118,6.248,3.1107,0.1666,1.709,6.2717,0.7438,5.364,0.9157,4.198,2.2042,3.5512,3.435,4.0938,5.8912,1.9295,6.627,4.5987,6.4852,3.0334,2.1946,9.939,1.0339,5.0374,2.8721,3.7185,4.5221,4.523,7.7836,9.1359,0.516,7.173,3.3556,0.354,2.5199,0.0827,6.4778,2.0755,0.3667,1.7096,1.0144,1.8222,0.0724,8.6276,1.2723,6.0412,4.0111,3.9436,4.8198,6.2627,9.3542,1.9511,9.29,1.8928,5.581,1.4226,1.9841,2.2446,2.6149,3.5258,2.4791,1.2435,4.0558,2.2258,1.9032,6.3223,1.6002,4.1757,3.2317,2.7613,0.1458,2.6243,4.8129,2.4949,0.7406,0.2059,1.6374,2.7903,0.0471,3.607,5.7423,8.4691,0.0326,4.5997,2.5825,3.7206,2.7369,2.7585,0.1896,0.0054,5.904,2.373,0.8046,3.2733,2.9956,3.5727,3.3555,1.9941,0.9067,0.9908,1.81,3.8941,5.5098,6.9539,1.2385,0.8553,0.572,0.9399,5.1214,0.2667,4.2473,3.2707,4.6381,3.8077,4.1696,1.856,1.3249,1.1211,3.9646,0.2482,4.3167,1.1105,3.5401,5.3543,2.1052,5.1792,2.4896,3.6233,4.3078,1.9345,5.3121,1.4279,3.7723,3.7724,7.0258,0.6172,3.2779,3.8795,0.9192,2.3966,1.8048,2.5599,0.1334,3.8445,7.6441,3.2997,5.81,3.3784,0.2014,2.039,0.1553,2.7984,4.4172,2.2403,2.7869,0.0175,0.175,2.9475,1.4934,1.4773,1.0012,3.8947,0.8851]}

Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars, writing, \" The Food Album is an unexpected revelation.\"\nAlthough the singles failed to make much history outside of the UK, the album's popularity was such that many of its lyrics eventually found their way into the British pop lexicon. \"Food Album\" and other songs were translated into several languages in the form of parodies or interpretations.

Undeterred, Rossio and Elliott created a successful production in 2001, The Little Mermaid. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, the film was directed by Rob Marshall, adapted by Ted Elliott from the classic fairy tale by Kenneth Grahame and produced by Steven Spielberg. The film became a cult classic and a box-office success, eventually receiving three Oscar nominations. The Little Mermaid proved that it was possible to adapt an old book, incorporating new technology, and making it both visually and emotionally resonant. Today, there are an estimated twenty-two screen adaptations of the original tale, including several animated films in the series based on the book. In a recent essay on screen piracy, the Oxford Dictionary of Film and Television wrote: \"The Little Mermaid was one of the most successful film adaptations produced to-date, as a story that is both familiar, but fresh enough to appeal to today's generation.\"","token_len":218,"entropy":[2.6222,4.0638,1.9515,0.0632,13.3214,1.4589,6.557,6.5057,0.2059,5.3231,5.6137,9.4279,6.0505,1.5172,8.2098,6.1836,1.4937,0.9646,9.9904,5.7074,6.5718,7.0763,4.1301,0.1042,7.1168,1.1934,1.9937,3.8096,5.0713,0.8334,1.577,5.6416,1.1576,4.7022,2.6805,1.7747,9.331,0.6859,0.0005,0.2756,3.2348,0.0044,2.4024,0.3451,2.7865,0.9254,6.8029,4.9372,3.3007,3.1154,1.4764,3.2174,5.8612,0.6257,1.5486,7.6747,0.0309,0.2729,5.7119,0.0048,2.0489,0.5797,0.9841,1.1018,1.61,2.8538,0.0381,5.4073,3.9012,1.0419,7.81,0.8037,5.4189,0.1048,5.2903,1.2677,4.9972,2.9888,0.0495,1.5786,7.0239,7.7974,1.8354,0.001,2.212,3.8581,0.0848,4.461,0.3795,0.5452,1.6446,1.1529,4.1617,0.7369,1.7367,1.3447,1.52,3.3575,4.434,2.0983,0.0005,1.3395,1.2814,5.8166,4.488,4.2469,1.2526,0.063,0.9199,2.0722,2.973,0.0002,6.3597,2.7691,3.3607,1.2103,1.9646,0.1107,4.023,2.9544,2.771,5.661,2.2887,7.4858,4.2563,5.3193,1.0628,1.3715,6.782,1.9181,4.9657,2.8919,0.6602,2.9213,2.8452,0.0038,0.2241,5.6569,0.3818,3.7381,0.2379,5.449,0.2277,5.1676,1.1681,1.8594,5.4609,4.2611,0.4947,0.4805,3.1368,4.0639,1.3482,1.9949,3.4403,4.576,1.6405,3.8077,0.747,2.8779,6.4382,0.0801,0.4234,2.7129,0.4559,3.3201,4.4481,1.8884,4.9423,2.0844,3.1455,10.277,0.2744,3.364,7.2581,3.9293,0.5663,3.6299,0.2841,0.3314,4.964,1.5549,0.5284,1.6018,4.3192,0.0006,2.595,2.9719,0.0253,0.256,0.7649,2.0274,4.2758,0.6426,6.2216,4.6472,6.9934,0.0768,1.4209,3.9563,3.6151,5.2618,2.1107,4.1131,2.9948,4.1185,3.0281,3.584,6.2426,5.1091,0.3735,2.2534,0.1245,6.1493,0.0506,4.8487,2.1855]}

A counter-attack to Leeds playing time is common. The team prefers to play a three central midfielders with a deeper half \u2013 in which a number of the side\u2019s best players such as Jermain Defoe and Matej Vydra dominate \u2013 rather than a traditional four or five. The attacking midfielders, usually a mixture between a forward and a wing\u2013back, are supported by several talented support stars such as Phil Bardsley and Ronny Deila.\nThe side\u2019s ability to create opportunities on the wing and in the final third are often undermined by the side\u2019s lack of defensive ability. The side struggled to contain opponents effectively and suffered from lack of focus and individual errors in the tackle and marking.","token_len":221,"entropy":[11.0305,4.1388,9.3114,1.308,3.8801,1.81,7.2423,2.9348,3.8634,6.504,1.8336,3.3917,3.9888,2.363,7.9949,2.0534,5.7127,0.8258,6.2235,5.6181,3.4757,0.6483,5.0071,1.2289,1.7744,18.5876,9.5378,5.3375,9.312,1.8857,3.7945,4.964,1.448,0.562,5.263,4.6104,3.8726,5.7368,0.3203,1.282,0.0012,11.8371,1.3195,0.6206,0.9918,0.0001,5.4335,5.6044,4.1525,1.394,2.2498,2.8501,2.4623,4.2715,4.1037,2.5763,7.4683,4.6003,1.4053,5.3474,0.0209,5.2639,5.4194,2.2952,0.7766,5.2145,0.7865,0.2891,0.6598,0.5489,4.4132,5.88,0.6524,0.7904,4.5758,6.209,7.2894,8.4747,1.1882,5.4373,2.3817,2.5155,3.528,5.6471,0.5484,1.1406,2.2326,4.1523,5.4841,1.2672,3.7801,2.6572,2.0404,5.2459,4.1816,6.4901,3.9488,4.7924,3.9615,3.1555,0.0199,3.8731,5.2843,20.3457,7.6661,1.3196,5.9471,1.1042,6.302,0.0041,5.6122,0.3581,0.0171,0.0,1.3808,7.9674,0.9319,1.596,0.0325,0.0066,6.6958,4.4417,2.5014,0.0125,1.0117,4.6625,2.1892,2.9417,0.2003,3.1301,2.391,3.6507,2.7446,1.1173,3.4036,3.937,3.2626,3.9838,4.1959,4.1129,3.4816,0.5413,1.0435,4.9006,7.9147,0.8261,0.2927,1.5145,6.0978,0.1644,5.6556,6.18,8.3118,6.3593,1.592,0.003,5.8125,4.3724,0.0754,0.0208,1.1333,7.6331,1.4445,0.4739,0.0015,0.5706,0.7735,15.6358,4.4646,8.9745,0.2547,0.015,4.7605,0.0199,3.3739,3.5613,3.2365,0.2756,4.2785,2.4045,3.0032,0.8667,3.8493,0.0093,2.9732,3.7457,8.8381,0.1263,1.0901,5.321,4.2682,0.0998,0.1154,1.249,0.0043,3.6609,3.8719,0.7468,1.8461,2.849,8.3633,0.5284,4.1443,4.1821,8.3784,2.3716,5.9505,2.1697,4.5948,0.182,6.4763,1.3899,6.2544,5.7344,2.3622,1.194,6.7805,1.557,5.9647,1.34]}

In its September issue, Famitsu listed that Senj\u014d no Valkyria 3 would be arriving in 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A launch date of March 3, 2011 was announced, to coincide with a two-day weekend in March, but that was later pushed back to May. The game also featured a new character, Hisao Yukiya.\nIn spring 2011, the second game of the series, Valkyria Chronicles 2, was announced. An alternate version of the game was developed for the Vita platform, Valkyria Chronicles 2: Blazing Battles. The main development staff were moved from the second game to third. The title screen for the Vita version included a quote from Yoko Taro. In August, Sega released an original animation for the Valkyria Chronicles franchise titled \"A Message from Yoko Taro\", where the voice of Shinya Hashimoto reads his thoughts regarding the franchise's future. A version of the game was also released for iOS.","token_len":222,"entropy":[7.9887,3.7155,0.1731,2.839,10.5928,5.6437,1.4611,5.1099,3.9946,6.7804,1.7042,5.6866,0.0005,0.4123,1.128,2.2404,7.2943,3.0624,0.0308,0.357,1.0012,0.8874,3.077,4.2509,6.2589,6.6085,0.1783,8.3183,0.0005,5.0164,3.7309,10.1631,3.6627,4.7653,2.3883,5.3015,0.0261,0.0078,5.4114,1.1593,0.5781,5.5725,0.8589,5.4905,3.5946,1.1754,1.3214,0.8955,0.9447,0.0284,0.4873,3.9695,7.1592,0.4566,2.9669,3.1092,4.3667,1.1688,0.3859,0.8843,2.5062,1.6262,6.2469,1.5059,0.0118,3.1575,5.7929,0.1545,1.7371,5.7563,1.9331,4.3538,2.7009,4.5713,3.54,1.6681,2.5586,3.1818,0.078,1.1185,3.234,1.1126,2.5314,1.674,4.1665,2.4828,1.2246,1.8559,2.4828,0.8791,9.9761,1.4589,4.5519,2.82,4.1175,1.7142,0.6052,13.3756,7.3926,0.3895,0.0496,1.9333,5.0717,2.3917,1.9812,0.4314,1.5433,0.8504,1.7686,0.0296,0.0049,0.07,1.2077,0.594,0.2745,0.7773,1.158,5.6966,5.3987,2.645,0.3711,0.5116,0.3766,0.6715,4.419,1.9294,1.3445,4.8547,5.3622,1.0355,5.1432,0.0374,0.0123,0.054,1.7919,1.5692,7.4708,9.0883,1.7875,1.7549,4.6509,6.3687,3.796,2.43,7.0685,1.5581,1.4089,4.9385,0.2952,0.6799,7.387,1.9352,1.7774,4.5345,6.6816,2.9174,0.7641,4.4147,0.7266,5.1758,1.0579,6.2015,0.5386,3.4749,7.0026,2.2577,0.4127,2.9195,2.7296,3.5462,1.7507,3.0262,1.5342,2.559,5.15,6.9149,1.1717,0.5369,2.6126,0.001,0.0241,0.0963,4.0675,4.9909,2.6077,4.1028,6.3408,1.5847,4.0313,0.1921,0.3797,0.0033,2.5501,4.3051,1.4233,3.0151,2.3148,10.699,0.0413,7.1115,0.1485,7.8731,5.4996,3.2905,4.3613,0.4761,5.5842,1.5955,1.7416,0.2701,3.5496,5.2144,0.1679,0.2605,0.5823,0.4805,1.0862,0.7699,0.6127,6.1641,1.637]}

The Australian raven is also somewhat closely related to the Torresian crow and the common crow, which, like the little raven, prefer tropical or subtropical forests. Its closest relatives in Asia are the lesser raven and the Asian raven, both of which occur in a much drier and more arid region.\nHow did the Asian and Australian raven speciate?\nLike many species of birds, the Australian raven shows high levels of genetic variation at a range of neutral markers. When the genome of the species was examined using high-density SNP arrays, it was found that the Asian race has the same amount of genetic variation as the forest raven. But the Asian race has much more variation at protein-coding loci, and particularly at genes related to visual perception, behaviour and sensory organs. In fact, these differences in the content of variation at non-coding and protein-coding loci in the Asian and Australian races may explain why they are so ecologically different.","token_len":223,"entropy":[8.8079,15.4335,3.5262,8.0796,1.3426,1.4873,1.3152,5.7816,3.5941,2.0758,1.2288,1.8636,10.1627,0.611,1.3421,7.6869,0.7341,8.9867,4.2494,1.8378,10.3101,1.7742,0.6684,1.6723,1.6038,0.8086,1.0219,3.3713,6.7471,3.7155,0.036,0.0591,0.3572,11.2411,5.0296,3.8663,2.0949,1.7208,5.2712,3.9423,1.7075,2.4856,5.6708,1.856,0.3161,3.6484,0.244,0.1586,7.5223,6.2099,3.7543,1.2637,0.0005,0.0012,4.0007,0.6539,6.4377,2.467,0.3557,3.3868,4.9294,0.7385,0.2975,6.1341,3.8369,1.0107,0.6586,4.1295,1.7824,1.5953,3.6158,0.6097,0.0358,4.0881,0.4372,4.7999,3.1033,5.409,0.0001,2.3833,1.9204,2.7741,0.0077,0.9359,1.0067,1.5106,7.2758,3.5544,1.0857,5.8796,2.5614,1.5829,0.811,10.1684,2.5968,4.3891,0.6888,1.1612,5.4198,3.05,2.4277,0.3291,1.2722,0.2916,0.9443,1.462,0.454,7.5394,5.0893,2.3474,0.0081,2.7098,1.134,5.044,2.7724,3.5194,0.4053,10.3821,5.4301,1.2124,5.2207,2.6683,4.5085,1.0464,0.8925,4.3839,1.4777,3.3823,3.6582,5.0605,0.5382,3.746,3.2479,2.1562,0.7182,2.0561,1.1716,0.4532,0.3998,0.9807,2.6095,8.056,3.5846,2.6047,3.1235,4.3641,0.0112,2.1507,0.4955,0.6559,0.2315,7.8669,1.3013,0.9071,4.8782,1.6599,2.4431,0.7799,1.2213,3.3363,1.213,1.9264,1.6486,10.0824,2.4207,0.4591,0.0317,2.9661,0.003,1.4621,2.2591,7.2763,0.6436,3.0786,3.5479,0.0166,6.6198,1.3856,1.5435,6.8475,0.5838,4.9519,4.9238,0.5871,2.9258,2.2425,0.0667,4.1516,3.7429,2.3076,1.9533,8.4908,0.069,8.0628,2.0473,7.0445,0.1555,1.9462,0.0499,4.5002,1.1423,0.107,0.0517,0.0019,0.3081,0.0036,4.3175,0.2871,1.0706,1.8803,0.6377,1.7966,3.2948,2.0561,0.6449,2.7643,1.7225,1.7674,11.0973,0.0035,2.2896,0.665]}

The Qianlong emperorship extended from 1735 to 1796 (the rule of the four Manchus \u2013 Qianlong, Daoguang, Guangxu and Qianxi ) and there are some traces of their rule in the city.

Potter also went on to own a printing press and a number of other business ventures.\nIn 1990, Potter decided to move away from running his father's Eagles Boys stores and concentrate on other businesses. The store in Sydney, however, remained a family affair and Potter stayed on as President of the business.

Lee replaced former Clemson defensive back, Sean Burrill, a year ago, after Burrill served a 10-game suspension for PED use (.","token_len":229,"entropy":[10.6443,2.4753,3.6097,2.2516,10.2183,1.5799,1.3868,7.5155,1.8725,5.9264,0.7009,3.712,0.0638,0.1831,1.2868,0.331,3.2569,3.8854,0.1388,0.0572,5.4576,17.6526,5.8671,10.7968,8.9568,3.1229,0.2427,2.4869,3.3606,1.2491,0.3938,1.8373,5.1261,2.475,0.4912,4.7952,1.4774,0.336,5.983,3.4347,3.1716,4.5514,0.0387,7.2264,4.4415,6.3658,0.4602,2.4685,0.4609,1.3051,10.3001,12.3899,2.0264,4.6121,1.5133,1.7092,3.381,0.6531,0.1707,1.0327,1.0174,7.0417,5.1266,1.217,1.1652,0.5885,2.4338,4.6796,0.0265,3.8885,0.2328,3.3979,3.8847,0.6024,10.5549,1.6526,3.2232,4.9374,1.0767,2.3128,5.4652,5.7336,1.0065,1.9254,4.2347,0.7926,2.1391,5.7158,3.0939,3.6628,3.1327,6.1833,4.8581,2.444,0.117,2.23,7.661,3.0484,0.0281,5.9614,6.7728,2.4595,0.0726,1.9124,0.0032,6.7684,0.0936,6.5283,1.6879,0.8835,0.3249,3.6671,3.3437,6.5918,5.1218,4.0855,0.9185,1.7444,2.2658,1.7032,2.8942,0.9142,4.6446,9.9504,1.4789,0.564,0.5446,0.7392,7.7842,5.9682,12.5437,3.4845,0.2371,4.142,6.1904,11.3086,6.2037,2.5227,5.4603,1.9124,4.1079,3.3711,1.2487,6.9733,12.144,1.2804,5.6086,1.6057,2.8024,0.2453,3.3546,4.4932,4.6114,1.0069,6.1745,0.2543,5.6358,3.6279,0.0019,0.0013,3.581,3.174,5.9388,4.0857,1.9625,1.4154,1.1411,4.1265,6.5569,4.1394,4.1607,2.7662,1.9141,2.3942,3.0336,2.5368,6.237,3.375,0.825,6.4655,6.1004,1.7908,4.5078,2.8261,6.3439,0.381,2.3089,2.6604,7.5789,5.8571,11.5725,1.4513,0.8081,6.3842,1.1729,0.4457,2.4636,4.109,2.0878,3.5358,6.43,4.7583,1.5445,1.9469,1.7833,1.2258,5.6608,7.6474,4.2245,0.4824,4.1925,2.2782,0.1153,2.1304,3.0441,4.2896,0.0011,7.4524,1.4619,4.5483,0.0636,0.1394,0.0408,0.9963,6.254,0.0754,0.7131,12.0774]}

The","text":"Robbie Daw of Idolator appreciated the plot twist of the video, commenting, `` We really expected Nicki to waste that other warrior @ - @ in @ - @ training hater. The song itself feels like it's going in the direction of Nicki's next big single. Nicki Minaj's latest music video for'War,'which features Sech appears to be the song's visual hook. When she sings that war is over, and the person you are fighting is your mother, you are like, oh. My goodness, what in the world. She sings this song from the view of someone who has gone to war with her mother and has lost. The song is beautiful and full of emotion, but it also has the feeling of a song written a few years ago. The first verse of the song is beautiful, but then, it becomes a song about losing who you were and how you are starting all over again. The title refers to a fight and it's about a person wanting revenge on a mother. When you have been betrayed by another person and then it all goes south, that's what this song is about.","token_len":230,"entropy":[9.2412,9.6568,6.4396,12.4096,5.5542,11.8165,0.8984,9.1498,3.6019,2.8685,1.2726,5.6766,1.3665,7.029,0.9704,9.4153,8.6695,3.5241,7.1194,8.2377,3.9204,1.577,8.4318,5.1819,8.1076,10.7472,13.43,8.8458,5.3336,7.5395,11.5145,3.0462,2.7042,6.5478,9.2552,5.3007,2.1985,3.4685,7.8654,4.4548,5.6361,1.1537,1.6986,1.0534,3.4153,4.0854,1.3723,1.1322,0.1987,4.6785,0.098,0.8446,5.9645,4.2771,6.5214,1.0486,4.8157,0.0308,11.0866,0.0247,1.7932,5.7098,5.5913,0.317,3.3376,9.8029,8.5264,4.6523,6.8446,3.922,9.479,6.6311,10.676,0.6761,0.5887,3.372,4.8393,2.6109,8.2397,4.5939,1.3328,5.1387,3.2574,2.281,3.671,10.0794,4.2928,2.3677,0.6041,5.027,2.1985,6.5359,4.6916,2.9905,1.8786,1.1427,3.0551,4.1203,0.4095,2.024,2.585,5.8429,0.8971,4.211,4.4507,4.7891,3.6787,1.1786,3.1511,5.1108,0.3041,1.192,5.4201,3.6277,3.6287,2.6339,0.7985,5.1576,1.2397,7.8477,0.1314,4.1217,0.9454,2.2143,4.9366,2.7858,0.5198,2.8408,1.6465,2.0509,2.4022,3.1649,2.6769,2.5556,3.1444,1.7477,1.4847,4.8795,1.3151,5.4258,0.015,1.922,1.4921,1.7994,1.5377,2.3848,2.1703,2.0719,2.8634,0.3245,1.7954,4.2955,3.8595,6.1173,1.8099,0.6953,0.4669,1.4897,2.3709,4.8864,3.8497,1.6237,0.4559,0.2638,1.148,4.7077,1.1214,1.1911,2.9096,3.1982,2.3033,2.9857,1.6557,2.8816,1.0791,3.7096,7.0191,0.136,3.2143,2.3634,2.1354,0.3094,2.7897,7.9289,6.55,0.0146,0.0376,0.4274,2.0163,5.5314,5.9666,0.0454,2.0676,5.3823,5.0175,3.0146,1.1337,2.5064,2.6544,3.0966,6.9135,3.4445,0.9806,2.4483,4.3934,2.2568,4.1706,2.1094,3.4512,3.6778,4.7649,0.8122,5.1134,0.6369,1.8776,3.812,4.2823,5.2461,2.1677,3.7587,0.6306,2.5613,0.7196,2.2863,2.661,0.2433,0.528,0.4134,0.2822]}

There may have been a third tsunami that swept some communities, including Ikenoe.\nOn March 19, scientists from the University of Tokyo and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology released a map showing damage caused by the March 11 tsunami in various locations on the mainland.","token_len":232,"entropy":[9.9466,6.9692,0.17,0.0131,1.4613,2.4658,3.9409,0.462,3.7906,0.23,9.0156,0.4576,0.6758,5.9144,2.6708,1.359,2.041,6.0598,4.8832,1.3998,1.181,7.3221,3.7319,2.5147,0.418,4.7734,1.5046,4.3231,0.6765,1.2718,8.1796,4.3391,2.268,5.569,4.9159,1.1804,0.2369,6.0613,1.1448,1.6995,4.5583,0.4461,0.9044,1.5153,3.2183,8.2764,1.8563,1.1827,0.1037,0.5725,4.696,2.4757,4.4265,2.5774,1.3813,1.3925,4.5597,1.0556,0.3184,0.5337,3.4351,0.2011,0.6608,21.7332,0.8192,4.2965,0.0178,0.4241,2.4091,0.5487,0.8241,0.0509,3.6842,0.8402,1.3273,3.5088,16.3076,7.4516,4.5862,3.0856,0.0842,1.1257,1.9154,2.1401,6.74,2.6772,1.307,3.0482,0.0501,0.0642,2.3554,0.7081,1.4492,4.1938,1.8437,0.0126,2.5187,0.0329,4.3714,1.0596,3.7357,1.6105,0.1216,0.0735,2.0311,3.5759,0.7317,0.4838,1.4807,0.2234,0.4187,7.6406,0.0041,1.8399,3.542,3.1917,0.2785,0.3731,1.9137,0.0071,0.035,2.8623,0.0838,1.1179,4.3467,1.5874,4.2007,0.0037,1.2989,0.7108,1.328,5.0309,4.7228,7.1389,6.7138,5.0646,3.0808,0.0752,2.4586,1.7232,1.6131,2.2146,5.5455,6.57,0.2638,1.3087,7.1002,0.3342,4.0106,7.5921,2.5436,1.8416,5.4627,1.4363,0.0116,1.3351,4.3841,4.0771,18.4269,1.1081,5.1246,4.9329,2.2475,2.2678,0.0896,0.3795,0.8534,4.0882,0.7281,5.579,2.3191,2.3954,5.3903,5.4493,1.993,1.3742,4.8118,4.7455,0.5542,0.0487,2.5529,4.252,3.8755,2.4927,4.5212,6.8983,6.6643,2.7921,2.74,6.2992,5.6432,6.3669,3.3821,0.5659,4.0316,2.7398,3.3638,0.238,6.961,1.6505,0.6389,2.824,0.0099,1.3911,1.3041,0.6372,1.8865,1.3039,0.1942,6.9049,1.824,1.5838,1.8743,5.5174,0.7981,4.6345,0.8549,6.9334,2.4218,0.0632,0.7626,4.785,2.788,2.2291,1.7829,6.1325,1.9292,3.2,0.8371,4.5264,1.2414]}

Additionally, no major storm surge was reported, limiting the potential for casualties to large houses, and other types of flooding.\nThe cyclone made landfall in northern Myanmar as a Category 4 system at 7:15 a.m. local time (2:15 a.m. eastern) Saturday, with winds of 165 mph and sustained gusts reaching 194 mph. The maximum sustained winds were reported on land at Mandalay, 90 miles north of Yangon.\nAlthough the impact of the storm was immediate and significant, most of the damage was to homes, trees stripped of leaves on streets and farmland, most of the loss was to rural properties.\nAfter passing through Myanmar, the strongest component of the storm continued a gradual course toward the northern Indian Ocean, where it should dissipate in the next few hours. It was expected to have made landfall Sunday in India.\nForecasters noted that tropical cyclones move at very high speeds through most parts of the Indian Ocean, particularly as the storm tracks follow the general west-east flow.","token_len":233,"entropy":[9.9562,4.2518,8.2283,15.8065,3.5159,1.0283,6.5032,11.9896,0.0131,1.4911,8.6266,3.5963,3.8934,9.5785,2.8836,0.0081,12.8617,7.0152,0.2122,0.0855,6.6821,5.5811,2.0208,1.1424,8.3109,0.0202,5.025,1.9506,5.4167,1.4505,1.322,1.1071,2.4754,7.2868,0.7036,2.397,0.2546,5.2413,2.3981,4.5577,7.1976,1.9584,3.7827,5.82,5.6995,0.0155,2.6416,1.6054,0.4968,11.439,3.8283,0.0592,4.4796,0.0594,1.1626,3.8855,0.9282,5.1062,1.0755,1.0578,0.8838,7.9696,4.0113,2.8641,0.6153,3.1689,1.1774,0.0006,0.0004,0.1876,0.712,0.009,0.8268,3.763,0.2873,0.0187,1.5964,0.0004,0.0015,0.0976,5.4886,2.4158,3.9366,1.3313,2.4302,1.5645,0.7121,4.9347,0.7426,2.2593,4.1474,2.5074,0.019,7.1626,8.2785,0.2371,1.0972,1.5525,5.2345,0.1386,1.0367,0.7813,5.5857,3.6792,7.0998,1.4474,9.1673,0.3294,3.4104,7.0805,0.2446,2.2791,0.4393,2.5946,0.0027,0.7721,0.5108,5.7148,1.07,6.2149,0.787,0.2144,1.4574,1.1586,6.7548,1.8736,4.0215,0.0972,4.8615,0.8002,0.1283,1.781,0.6706,3.0684,2.4877,1.2791,6.0844,13.3567,0.6819,3.1517,6.3242,5.0754,0.6408,6.0082,0.83,5.5835,0.4954,1.3986,7.0515,1.3553,1.1261,5.996,8.4142,1.0701,1.0963,5.0745,6.6749,0.8398,3.2419,1.6358,0.4462,6.8508,7.2409,0.0903,0.0974,0.863,5.3148,5.676,4.7521,4.6571,2.5504,0.9997,3.8071,2.8925,0.0611,1.1895,3.752,0.4093,7.1125,5.1813,0.0011,2.5359,1.3315,1.4181,1.146,0.3884,0.4279,3.5364,1.9704,1.875,0.2897,4.5368,4.47,0.0873,5.3456,3.057,4.7249,1.7086,0.4305,5.0953,0.1836,4.6715,0.6308,5.0051,0.0882,0.3961,5.5304,3.0873,4.094,1.0452,0.433,3.9619,5.5414,2.1729,0.0007,0.1055,3.3499,0.0416,0.807,4.1826,5.2271,1.8565,2.0181,6.2214,8.6005,1.5859,7.6957,5.4764,1.6853,4.7298,4.3783,2.0346]}

After Janine and Bob are left out on the streets, they are shown the place and its amazing interior decor, which is decidedly more upmarket than their usual lodgings. When an invading army of Nazi sympathizers arrives, the couple are forced to leave the pub and Bob is taken into a German concentration camp. Butcher escapes with the help of the landlady and her assistant, both of whom give up their statuses in order to save the pub from occupation. Janine is given the use of the pub and she and Bob finally get married.

He also noted that parts of the episode \"will give the listener a shiver\" due to a number of themes being explored, though he said it did so \"without seeming forced\" or \"awkwardly melodramatic\". Writing for IGN, Jason Birchmeier gave the episode a score of 8 out of 10. In his review, Birchmeier called the episode \"relentlessly dark and unsettling\" and gave it a score of 8.50 out of 10. The Times wrote that the episode was \"not only dark and unsettling\" but also \"intensely personal\" given that the characters \"don\u2019t know what will happen with their lives, only that it will happen. They don\u2019t know who they\u2019re going to see, only what will happen when they meet them\". Michael Ausiello of the Boston Globe rated the episode as B- and wrote the finale was \"tough to watch\" due to the \"horrific\" deaths of both Gellar and Stahl.","token_len":237,"entropy":[13.7049,8.2809,3.0701,1.8409,1.5487,10.7797,6.1365,7.5712,1.3435,1.2485,8.1196,4.984,1.799,11.3918,9.5816,7.661,3.9109,1.9568,6.7386,0.1523,0.0761,0.01,0.0,4.939,1.2137,2.2525,0.9214,4.5213,0.6472,1.2195,3.0463,2.7755,2.4255,0.3633,8.8719,0.2503,0.3696,1.0096,2.8572,5.1141,4.9196,2.6078,4.3171,0.874,8.7182,0.6893,2.8005,5.1662,0.0135,3.7024,3.8424,0.0044,5.2524,4.7457,1.869,2.8633,4.8156,0.9564,3.0738,2.2892,4.3782,4.0146,2.4705,3.2722,5.6564,5.8636,3.2898,1.9955,1.1,6.408,0.1172,5.1737,6.9355,0.032,0.0069,0.0174,2.0888,8.8416,1.3264,4.2912,0.255,5.3325,7.6235,4.3659,4.7573,0.4302,0.1411,0.4796,3.7385,0.0963,3.0841,2.4595,0.0016,0.0363,0.8447,4.0322,2.5518,0.4922,0.7327,1.9649,0.0003,2.6791,0.4506,0.5676,0.3753,6.7828,2.6552,0.5388,5.9427,1.0291,4.3138,1.6409,0.4265,5.0683,0.9955,0.779,2.6796,0.0367,1.3931,1.2207,5.8051,0.3512,0.0009,0.036,0.3246,2.5536,9.1702,5.2816,0.7421,1.1886,0.4374,1.7332,0.7891,3.7697,3.4068,2.868,0.998,1.4947,5.5096,0.2245,1.0466,0.3628,4.5948,0.9414,0.1004,4.4892,1.9282,4.9312,1.2523,1.6368,2.2335,2.8079,4.5845,14.2591,7.7412,1.3505,3.6187,1.4561,6.1753,0.3245,4.9859,1.1907,0.4641,2.7841,4.6992,1.6181,2.5699,0.996,2.6917,3.5373,3.3039,2.6951,0.543,0.5956,0.019,0.7692,3.2909,1.3324,3.9327,0.604,0.5908,1.9345,0.0318,4.9335,1.86,2.5079,2.7695,2.2181,0.1803,2.6245,0.3061,3.8158,1.1847,3.2552,6.313,7.8479,3.1254,0.0484,0.6753,1.705,4.1595,0.2025,5.212,0.2282,0.0416,1.9802,9.1005,1.1754,3.2794,3.3363,4.5879,6.7944,4.3044,0.4424,5.0736,2.8752,2.1557,0.7213,2.1617,3.55,0.0457,0.8875,1.7773,4.1698,1.2635,0.4874,2.0437,6.8942,0.4734,3.9272,6.6738,7.7709,0.2128,6.2306,3.8092,0.6291]}

He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them one on top of the other in damp dark garages until satisfied they had enough dimensions to sell. This method proved successful in the later years and at the end of his long and productive career he worked for a large art gallery.\nOne of his pupils, Vincent van Gogh, was known to hang dozens of his paintings on the same wall, a characteristic he drew on in later works. He kept journals in which he recorded what he was thinking and feeling as he painted, describing his process. One of these journals is included in the exhibition. The art historian, John Ruskin, commenting on a painting by Vincent van Gogh, wrote that the artist \" goes on painting as blind men see \".\nRuskin may well have been aware that as a child, Busch himself suffered from epilepsy but this did not deter him from pursuing his talents, or even when he died the Dutch physician continued to look at the notes taken by his student, concluding on 20 February 1904 that Busch had been suffering for many years from two forms of epilepsy.","token_len":238,"entropy":[7.6423,8.8585,3.8792,11.0168,5.5347,3.7291,2.0636,3.2414,0.1711,3.4342,0.1122,1.7155,7.572,4.8737,0.9841,1.8228,6.9118,9.7295,1.7088,0.8339,2.0305,0.3038,8.0094,1.4495,6.5557,9.3485,1.15,5.8521,1.9831,0.9715,0.1349,2.5045,0.095,2.6882,11.291,8.139,8.4617,1.435,5.3528,8.8702,4.0862,2.2362,5.0417,7.4212,0.4716,8.6604,1.2403,4.1284,4.3848,4.1805,2.9921,1.4937,1.9091,6.5027,1.484,4.0667,5.2288,1.2313,2.0838,0.0535,2.9787,6.7896,3.9238,4.5056,1.0403,1.6997,5.3532,2.2299,1.9663,3.5055,4.8069,1.1176,2.1591,1.1372,8.5818,0.4976,0.8938,6.5732,0.7092,6.5592,2.564,0.1921,0.0034,0.1145,1.5179,4.4511,1.4606,6.9625,7.5814,0.0833,2.1609,0.39,1.1038,1.312,6.0447,1.7998,2.1453,4.6886,6.8794,2.761,6.8797,2.6189,3.2418,5.0023,1.8046,0.486,2.4256,5.4473,8.5151,3.292,0.4479,0.2246,3.1325,3.7587,0.2907,3.5201,3.7263,1.2679,4.0269,3.1903,0.3659,2.8512,1.6203,5.2549,1.5682,4.3806,2.3443,3.323,0.6608,2.3152,1.1923,2.5006,5.232,0.2857,1.2295,2.7313,2.7643,2.7215,4.957,2.2705,2.2674,3.8477,7.2205,0.8948,0.2645,8.4077,0.1669,4.3378,3.4974,1.5866,4.2765,0.2507,0.0012,0.0003,1.1295,2.2422,1.4544,2.369,2.4799,1.3431,13.9714,2.1005,3.5276,4.1156,9.7921,6.9199,6.0971,8.2929,1.1387,6.6848,0.0006,6.7635,3.361,0.1621,0.6309,3.6298,1.2909,6.2553,1.8449,1.4805,1.8962,7.7298,0.004,6.7904,5.6564,0.3791,4.6822,4.7929,4.1609,2.7681,0.0193,3.2789,0.1795,0.2204,4.3424,0.897,5.4604,4.1606,4.8431,2.4606,6.7683,0.6653,3.9821,5.1586,5.1597,7.514,5.3211,0.3448,5.6654,2.3993,1.941,8.7843,5.7127,1.2952,1.7694,5.3438,2.0679,9.7117,6.332,8.1624,2.7575,4.9109,0.4947,2.9094,0.0012,1.4697,2.1442,3.1792,4.7617,2.7664,0.1836,0.787,7.1557,4.541,0.0223,0.3816,0.4685]}

Guitar Hero: World Tour includes the full set of songs. The Guitar Hero series has been criticized because of its use of music by copyright holders. Sony has responded to this by creating a \"backlink\" feature which allows the player to click on an artist and title that appears as an item in a song and a link is opened in order to listen to the song at Spotify. This is only possible for some of the copyright owners, but there is debate on the effect it has.\nIn the early days of the Guitar Hero series, players could also choose a number of different songs each round and play them in any order. During this period, some songs also featured special items that required the player to use their \"quick selection\" ability (by pressing certain buttons) to select an item in order to be able to play them. The use of these special items was removed in later versions of the games.\nThere are numerous awards and accolades that have been issued throughout the franchise's history, including the Grammy.","token_len":239,"entropy":[2.9817,0.8519,6.2374,2.8079,1.1268,11.2883,0.047,0.2719,3.8982,2.2571,6.5681,0.0098,3.5167,6.464,0.0614,2.4771,6.7419,0.1077,1.0534,5.2474,0.1489,6.5077,2.7731,4.666,4.9449,9.5713,1.7326,3.1369,0.7167,3.3509,4.5681,7.8393,5.095,0.4017,2.698,0.065,2.4367,3.9881,1.2103,3.3234,2.4143,3.6596,3.1264,0.4569,1.4179,3.1975,2.4836,2.112,0.0247,1.7991,2.6283,1.6177,7.2082,5.4897,0.822,0.6318,4.6729,0.0246,4.2007,3.2145,9.4776,0.935,1.8309,7.5101,2.0201,4.3481,1.7516,1.1522,2.3208,4.5177,0.6931,3.5915,6.6932,5.9487,0.3875,3.7531,2.9467,0.6626,2.7,2.7415,0.0751,6.1024,0.6689,3.4273,2.3437,2.9207,8.4246,4.0605,2.7984,4.1537,2.2947,4.502,0.9645,2.3871,3.3181,3.043,4.759,1.4915,2.5535,4.9628,2.2596,4.3599,0.0965,3.4451,0.3326,0.9775,1.0575,4.1863,8.1128,0.4224,3.0922,2.1424,4.6716,1.9506,2.6577,5.1616,2.5047,0.0677,8.9553,2.713,1.6945,1.3425,4.0852,1.3465,8.0698,2.117,1.6637,4.705,1.8816,0.4958,2.8072,1.384,8.3741,1.6422,3.7137,1.5276,0.1512,0.627,2.3087,0.0143,0.3837,0.1883,4.8335,1.5692,4.1763,2.7417,3.3609,4.3658,0.0561,2.1299,1.0917,5.6019,6.0837,2.7262,2.0527,0.8517,2.0069,4.4092,0.2581,0.7038,5.3946,2.4433,2.1363,0.3747,4.0535,1.5125,5.5051,2.0693,4.8291,4.9274,2.01,4.4866,2.4047,0.2776,0.042,3.7059,2.4465,5.2023,7.8061,6.311,0.3516,2.9675,3.4116,5.3955,1.6896,5.9209,0.6221,1.895,0.5859,1.1941,3.6802,0.3277,3.0595,3.2423,0.4509,5.1499,1.7753,0.0019,0.8167,0.8056,0.584,2.2947,5.0036,0.0071,1.7468,1.8403,0.1228,2.1552,6.2583,0.9269,4.1899,1.8881,0.236,0.2056,4.6132,1.0008,1.067,4.5226,0.9237,4.3141,7.7939,1.9211,4.3595,0.0034,2.0667,2.1974,0.233,5.8807,6.0059,0.2313,4.9269,3.7623,0.3145,1.4739,0.8298,1.2405,3.0105,5.6695]}

The territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, was being heavily criticised by the colonists for using excessive force against suspected secessionists as a response to a failed insurrection. The territory authorities, led by Governor Harrison, were in conflict with the colonists. They wanted the United States government to send federal troops into the South to suppress the rebellion. The colonists refused - not fearing the loss of civil liberties - because they felt that an intervention by the United States government would set the stage for federal control. It was not Jennings' style to take sides in what he believed was a misguided and dangerous issue, but in his personal interest he did offer to assist in solving the problem. That resulted in him being called upon by both the Territory government and the United States government to provide solutions. While he was still in the south as part of a delegation from the Vincennes University Board, he was contacted by the government to help resolve tension between the two sides. He became so involved that he stayed on in Louisville for over a year. He served with great ability in this important role.","token_len":242,"entropy":[8.063,6.6821,5.8603,12.3413,2.4159,2.7913,5.0708,0.4744,0.1693,9.655,4.3565,0.0475,8.5694,4.957,0.2464,0.259,1.7896,4.6743,2.3403,4.1807,6.8378,1.1296,9.2682,2.777,4.8091,8.827,2.7211,13.6994,1.934,2.6668,7.383,6.3738,1.7123,3.2295,4.3757,3.709,0.1379,1.815,6.0231,7.1017,4.1501,1.6102,1.3742,5.022,0.8148,4.8231,6.3283,0.499,1.6187,7.7203,6.9942,0.1186,5.088,1.7857,5.0361,0.0347,2.298,5.3263,3.9875,0.9801,2.6046,7.4187,6.9168,2.7665,3.07,0.0215,3.3514,3.2428,0.2607,2.3336,3.9514,5.064,0.2733,0.7882,2.7066,2.6323,3.1404,3.4623,2.084,4.8738,0.0665,2.6681,0.095,5.34,6.7795,0.3784,1.7272,0.4262,4.3382,1.0454,4.1081,0.7493,0.9369,0.5945,1.8332,3.3476,3.1216,7.1889,4.0704,7.1643,1.7459,4.3737,0.0103,5.9133,1.1974,2.5391,4.5354,0.9254,2.9483,1.3479,4.61,4.3374,1.3381,0.3607,1.3247,0.0151,2.43,0.6211,6.2461,1.5368,0.824,0.0296,6.4101,4.1957,1.7899,4.7564,0.4586,2.5635,13.2763,0.9932,7.9763,0.775,3.9694,1.3072,1.1582,5.7082,1.2968,2.7367,0.9268,0.6825,7.6279,3.3612,3.4428,6.5155,2.2126,0.5919,4.5307,2.3344,4.2813,3.2055,4.2085,2.5169,8.0542,2.248,3.3696,1.9206,5.2441,0.4715,2.1983,0.4778,5.6907,6.7554,0.0228,4.5604,1.5784,4.2036,3.2622,1.668,5.4668,0.9958,9.6016,3.6791,0.1839,0.4841,2.4429,0.0263,0.5221,0.3229,3.5554,7.9742,1.6714,5.0874,2.6654,0.9633,3.041,1.1815,1.264,7.4391,5.8193,5.0924,0.0016,2.5238,3.7263,2.1841,0.7152,4.6774,0.0368,0.0002,1.7742,2.7806,2.4673,1.3379,1.1536,4.1828,0.1045,1.3543,4.1618,1.957,2.4067,2.901,8.1363,1.1683,0.3012,2.0844,2.1012,0.3584,1.813,4.2122,5.5747,1.3381,1.0693,1.054,6.7488,2.1205,2.8525,7.7629,1.6536,3.8123,0.8499,0.2619,1.3372,2.1173,5.4173,3.8489,4.9466,6.7807,1.5918,3.8345,4.6403,1.7526,0.9819]}

(Cedar) are characteristic, together with mountain laurel (Opuntia sp.), and in places with less protection from winter cold, some of that landscape can resemble sub-alpine vegetation.","token_len":243,"entropy":[2.8347,0.9508,12.5692,1.09,1.4368,8.815,2.6572,0.7564,2.7864,0.1734,6.2777,1.5525,9.3324,1.8997,1.6302,3.9096,5.044,1.5564,0.194,3.6791,2.6524,11.7297,8.2269,3.4416,0.8282,2.0051,4.6267,9.5094,1.2823,3.356,3.1907,5.4274,4.4392,2.5475,3.0789,6.3234,8.7293,7.6307,0.5089,4.0747,10.4762,3.4407,0.0448,5.583,0.7132,1.0875,5.34,1.2384,10.3043,5.8471,6.7355,1.0003,2.8456,1.1748,3.4854,0.0821,1.0243,5.2429,5.6091,0.8948,8.8269,4.4781,0.6619,2.0168,1.1386,5.4171,5.2459,7.1524,7.4575,0.5185,2.898,5.9372,2.4437,0.1999,4.0909,0.4523,3.3904,6.3779,7.4484,0.3316,3.4181,6.6864,0.7656,0.1292,0.4983,0.8411,2.9477,0.0187,2.8652,4.142,1.2345,2.8953,3.481,11.5432,5.2411,3.9278,6.1878,0.5823,2.2301,9.4655,7.6846,2.1552,0.4847,5.2567,5.1432,0.4264,3.7641,0.3777,1.0036,4.2363,3.404,3.2414,2.0244,4.3258,2.2285,5.9989,3.5581,0.9767,8.1395,2.066,4.7705,3.4275,0.1592,5.9717,0.1921,0.9059,4.1655,0.933,0.1083,11.8896,3.6373,1.3852,1.084,7.3838,7.0088,2.4188,0.321,5.8,5.1665,1.9453,2.1459,6.2298,0.6505,4.6112,6.6154,3.1402,1.49,7.6153,4.8638,5.1865,7.0293,1.7945,3.6725,3.3033,8.7584,0.6067,0.7248,6.9655,0.8477,5.5337,3.1969,6.7634,3.6474,0.4093,1.562,2.7372,2.3234,2.2974,1.1714,4.9843,3.92,7.7335,6.5606,1.8694,5.4135,4.7432,1.6192,0.8159,6.0117,1.0703,0.0091,0.123,0.1779,0.3112,6.0448,1.3574,0.0034,4.0216,0.0012,6.0109,1.8807,3.9369,0.1726,0.9847,4.0355,3.2521,0.2548,0.4767,8.5673,3.0635,3.0838,0.0569,0.1548,2.7402,4.3824,1.8832,0.7022,7.5924,3.2307,7.195,0.1174,7.5411,2.8232,0.0895,3.087,7.5533,7.5396,0.746,3.51,2.6701,2.7956,4.4958,6.0033,3.3929,5.254,8.1006,1.0563,5.264,4.9627,1.5029,4.3926,2.1359,5.8146,6.1059,3.5582,6.5239,7.2017,1.3008,5.3727,0.0108,5.5294,0.6259]}

Evolutionary biologists subsequently refined this concept through the 1970s and 1980s, adding concepts from population genetics, ecology, and phylogeny. In contrast to the neo-Darwinist views of this period, they maintain that evolution is driven by natural selection acting on phenotypic variation, thereby creating and maintaining new species. In this view organisms are regarded as open systems, their life histories controlled by both environmental forces and internal biological functions. Thus, a species is viewed as a complex organism at various levels of organization, each with different units of selection, such as genes, genomes, cells, organisms, populations and species. For some in this approach, such as Stephen Jay Gould, evolution is an emergent property in large populations. In these views selection is not viewed from a materialistic perspective, but rather from a statistical or probabilistic perspective: a small variation in phenotype or genotype increases the probability of reproductive success, leading to a gradual, continuous increase in the frequency of some phenotypes and a gradual decrease in the frequency of others.","token_len":243,"entropy":[10.6498,6.5004,2.2849,1.0875,4.2766,0.1115,1.9024,0.5794,0.0002,4.3302,8.473,6.8647,2.9635,1.4254,6.7276,0.3014,1.4916,2.5859,5.3191,1.4541,6.0715,3.1408,8.4105,2.3531,3.3317,1.6014,6.5983,0.6168,8.2608,2.8698,0.0681,0.0002,3.0339,5.1718,0.7727,3.4588,8.1121,6.2376,2.6162,2.2747,3.8804,1.2918,5.5462,0.0013,1.1949,0.3496,0.0002,0.9038,6.4655,6.8397,4.2211,9.0083,0.1709,1.2056,4.6827,0.308,1.0514,4.8865,1.4895,1.2759,2.823,4.339,0.9848,1.3278,5.6804,0.0332,0.0533,0.0007,3.5413,3.3978,1.2308,5.5934,2.6869,0.0877,4.2889,4.9277,0.2201,2.384,0.978,4.5618,0.1104,2.5387,0.0317,5.9818,0.9156,6.9893,0.2607,0.0362,1.9697,1.6699,5.7469,3.6878,4.0328,1.7958,3.5645,1.4752,0.4487,2.9659,2.1617,1.614,7.3895,1.4921,8.0653,0.0595,10.0754,5.3554,1.4681,6.3631,5.1954,1.8621,6.6874,0.0975,7.061,5.3401,3.822,0.312,5.0766,4.0954,5.5586,0.3574,4.8474,0.6353,3.9957,3.315,1.292,4.2702,0.1609,1.3176,3.9161,2.3214,5.4494,4.6275,1.4736,0.9138,4.1375,1.025,4.4778,1.4505,2.7499,9.1186,0.3244,7.183,1.8735,3.4729,0.1293,2.718,0.8761,5.1344,0.0761,4.077,0.1698,4.3788,0.337,5.356,2.1601,3.3303,0.1867,4.3378,4.3415,5.8495,1.9456,6.28,0.1652,3.53,0.8683,5.3749,0.4152,0.0005,0.3859,2.7215,0.7035,3.1163,5.631,0.001,5.5968,4.0729,6.7142,4.2302,2.0671,2.4032,5.179,1.5193,8.0489,1.3338,3.1922,6.6213,6.7929,1.11,5.3761,0.9298,1.0369,0.7359,0.4389,1.4598,0.822,0.643,6.4164,2.9903,4.9831,0.0073,0.0026,0.5713,4.9201,2.9062,5.0349,6.1774,0.5506,6.9777,2.6813,6.0749,0.1267,5.9501,0.4925,1.3609,0.5235,8.1844,0.03,1.5362,4.7828,0.0668,1.7495,5.7915,3.7018,4.1308,1.3488,0.1262,1.1344,4.8887,0.2209,7.094,4.903,0.8682,2.385,2.4758,1.697,1.3141,0.0718,1.8396,1.2278,0.0355,0.128,0.1761]}

In total, the album scored four Grammy Awards before its final certification, which was issued by the RIAA in early 2007.\nThe 2006 version of \"Honeybee\" contains five additional songs, the most substantial additions since The Food Album. The song \" Hey Boy and Hey Girl,\" co-composed with former KRBQ host Bill McKinney, is similar in content to the title track and was included on The Food Album. Like the title track, the song \" Hey Boy and Hey Girl\" uses a folk-rock sound, with the piano and acoustic guitar supporting the vocals. Other songs added and re-mixed for the 2006 release, such as \" Blue Sky and White Clouds,\" \" If There Were a Way,\" and \" If There Was a Man \", combine traditional folk tunes with elements of pop and rock, such as electronic beats and more processed guitars.","token_len":245,"entropy":[8.7284,0.9474,6.5039,8.6928,11.2547,8.7352,0.3154,5.9937,10.9016,2.7777,0.1117,1.6228,5.3065,7.1344,3.0047,4.495,3.0003,3.3339,0.4571,3.462,7.4219,4.4928,0.0054,4.2001,0.5495,0.23,1.7378,0.6314,0.2182,1.84,0.9073,1.2056,5.1372,4.8251,2.2404,0.5606,2.2551,0.2938,0.0105,0.0694,0.0064,1.0281,5.298,1.3043,7.0818,2.9812,6.5926,0.2899,7.0694,0.3725,0.5853,1.9005,0.4393,2.7113,3.2579,2.106,0.8431,2.4827,0.1473,4.7767,6.0932,7.5581,0.0096,1.9527,3.7815,0.7878,0.868,2.5057,6.5957,0.0751,1.7407,0.2227,6.5574,4.6519,0.9542,0.8339,7.298,2.7178,3.9159,7.2394,2.2207,3.7945,0.6295,3.451,3.3954,0.3363,5.1011,0.03,0.0025,1.0795,5.0029,1.6626,0.1712,1.2449,10.6507,6.5314,4.3836,0.2574,3.5214,4.6982,3.0263,6.1284,0.4461,6.3162,4.0732,4.1564,1.2527,1.431,3.3527,2.336,7.7122,4.3569,2.5526,3.6485,1.8914,0.0469,1.5487,1.3488,2.9229,1.2396,11.0041,4.6718,6.5396,5.7767,0.5321,4.1929,6.1056,0.0303,8.4999,0.078,1.1407,5.216,5.8425,9.3379,6.0347,2.877,4.6039,8.4367,0.329,0.3769,2.1157,7.1125,1.3624,4.8229,0.2934,0.79,5.624,0.4549,3.0288,4.6263,3.2573,1.1495,2.7229,0.2872,0.0351,1.7698,6.0311,0.9558,2.8003,0.0765,0.1821,0.9133,0.712,2.4901,1.5496,0.2428,0.235,0.2941,0.0148,0.3391,4.6545,1.8325,7.071,2.1381,1.5635,3.891,1.7838,2.296,1.7118,5.0309,2.0838,4.9143,0.7953,5.5838,0.7534,3.1833,0.5413,5.0325,1.6416,5.9003,6.8143,2.774,1.3819,5.4708,1.363,3.1868,0.6543,1.5,3.1257,4.8721,2.3549,0.0014,0.3055,6.9397,3.8362,3.2876,3.8203,3.7552,2.7894,0.9684,7.2297,4.1747,1.2902,2.6366,5.4567,3.1456,0.7427,0.0796,5.5562,1.6689,2.5277,1.3177,6.6008,4.0222,6.7898,3.6319,0.7837,4.9996,0.3883,4.5685,0.3027,3.1188,1.8473,1.8486,2.2115,2.2557,0.001,5.9545,4.0754,0.9251,6.6105,7.6137,4.3788,0.4646]}

His reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in Somerset Maugham's 1941 novel The Story of an American Family ( as Walpole the Dervish ) in which he is shown to be obsessed by his sex, and a portrait in the 1946 novel A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Later in life Walpole was largely overlooked by many critics, his later fiction being considered inferior to his earlier work\nIn the 1960s, the novel The World According to Garp by John Irving gained success in Britain and was a best-seller in the United States. It has been argued that Irving was inspired by Walpole\nThe novel of the same name by Raymond Carver was a British bestseller in the late 1970s that he based on Walpole's stories. In the same era, the TV drama The Last Encounter, also an adaptation of Walpole's stories, was seen as being critically acclaimed.\nIn 2013, Walpole's life was dramatized in the BBC adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's novel The Last of the Mohicans by David Mamet and produced by Alan Taylor","token_len":245,"entropy":[2.6862,8.2744,0.1416,0.3371,5.701,8.1765,5.4454,8.9277,6.1522,7.7195,0.2242,4.9245,8.0023,1.2284,3.8818,10.0768,0.4565,0.4402,8.7344,1.2286,2.6754,4.8508,4.0212,3.9901,0.4314,6.1678,0.5564,5.0204,4.4185,3.2059,10.2703,6.5841,3.5439,10.485,0.459,0.0351,0.0026,0.9642,8.1255,1.1616,1.5757,5.9032,0.1562,4.2874,1.9314,5.4292,3.0671,12.1587,5.8306,0.0006,8.5444,6.7284,5.0879,0.1253,3.4581,2.8168,0.0521,1.0482,3.5944,3.2309,1.7399,0.6854,5.3888,2.9297,2.3872,6.7688,3.4284,2.2913,3.5033,6.0397,3.3842,2.0667,5.8925,1.7445,3.0844,4.9849,6.0973,0.9916,2.3276,1.1184,4.978,0.0571,4.0058,5.826,2.5741,2.1755,2.7816,0.0012,1.9182,5.8414,4.6522,1.4007,2.7363,2.473,0.8274,5.7298,5.5806,4.6907,1.8512,4.5383,6.1386,0.5747,1.5064,2.0896,0.7911,7.6235,5.7246,1.6193,2.5346,0.0122,0.5326,2.5637,4.9857,2.472,5.8176,6.8896,0.0182,6.071,7.0786,3.5993,3.5044,4.9282,6.5968,6.504,1.5762,3.841,1.1768,2.9955,3.7768,3.7659,2.4342,0.0571,0.9201,0.9118,0.7584,0.0019,0.4775,2.5748,4.3607,1.1913,5.5404,0.1631,1.8129,1.943,3.8884,0.2179,1.491,0.0027,6.1779,2.5415,2.7289,4.2766,1.3372,0.2187,0.044,2.2831,5.7604,2.2371,0.0375,1.8993,2.5108,5.137,4.2229,0.237,1.0482,0.7884,2.3648,2.5157,0.0034,5.512,5.2155,6.3617,1.2742,3.9844,0.0057,0.3133,5.4387,1.386,2.1736,1.6936,3.7257,5.7127,0.591,2.1006,8.1873,3.5058,1.5601,4.6715,8.9702,3.0109,4.0978,5.6658,1.4083,0.1224,1.8318,0.0025,0.0361,2.8268,0.1974,0.9967,5.7262,0.5787,3.2821,6.3783,1.9226,1.3532,1.5885,1.7124,6.3489,0.3484,2.653,0.004,1.7609,4.2782,1.4051,7.3153,0.0016,0.199,0.5882,1.5838,4.1551,3.6026,0.331,8.0414,4.028,0.0164,2.3495,0.0739,1.8557,1.2444,3.9234,4.0828,1.8985,2.8729,0.0993,3.0758,3.5022,6.4453,0.0034,2.4284,5.2054,0.1864,5.4717,4.6693]}

Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops have in past years yielded greatly less than would have been the case had grasshoppers not been feeding on them.\nGrasshoppers feed on grass, forage, corn, alfalfa, oats, fruit, soy beans and other plants. The adults have a feeding apparatus consisting of two chelicerae, the front one of which is fixed to the thorax. The mouth parts of the insect are modified into a sort of broom with which it cleans the leaves and stems of all foreign matter.\nThey are one of the most destructive pests of corn crops. Attracted to the light under which corn grows, they lay their eggs in the silk beneath the leaves.

Finally, as a team, they utilized steroids in a coordinated fashion.\nSince then there have been no instances of performance enhancing drugs in competitive cyclists.

By 1956, seven additional small reservoirs were added, increasing the capacity of the main and western reservoirs of St. John's Wood to 22 million gallons (81,000\u00a0m\u00b3). These small reservoirs and drains were designed and built by the Board and the Ministry of Aircraft Production and the Board's Works Division, and the cost was shared between the Ministry of Aircraft Production and the Board (at a ratio of 1:1). The reservoirs were named with names of British naval captains and were built to a design by the Board's Works Division, with assistance from Professor William Dyson, who was one of the pioneers in drainage engineering. The first named reservoir in the network was called the \"Nelthorpe Reservoir,\" named after Lord George Augustus Eliot's grandfather.","token_len":253,"entropy":[9.1943,7.6379,6.8885,6.0157,10.57,9.5506,9.2446,3.4569,0.3159,6.6349,2.0099,0.8886,10.1163,1.9134,3.2907,1.2341,3.3867,0.098,1.8235,4.2548,1.8573,12.0981,9.2465,5.1294,3.5587,4.0579,3.1815,1.8208,4.9216,4.1459,3.9908,5.6195,6.9585,5.4566,5.6175,6.2177,4.722,1.7562,0.3882,4.748,3.4167,5.1012,1.3519,0.0588,0.0896,1.9979,4.2256,1.8506,0.4298,3.5883,5.1698,0.6408,1.126,3.0553,6.6612,6.8423,4.0922,4.2069,3.7808,13.7406,6.5916,0.1598,4.9752,2.2014,5.2452,0.0256,1.3697,5.5508,2.6572,5.1184,2.5362,2.6857,0.2221,5.2181,3.268,3.3909,1.9648,2.0801,4.6804,1.7587,2.1301,1.8622,2.5747,3.9766,3.6325,0.042,2.0148,4.3278,1.4091,0.0921,0.0405,0.1293,3.82,1.6103,0.7423,0.0607,0.3703,4.0412,2.675,0.4404,7.0056,4.6635,7.6907,2.5849,0.8743,3.3591,1.3522,5.9364,0.6055,2.4247,0.8583,0.5372,5.7378,5.9871,8.6952,2.0161,3.7169,2.7366,0.1337,0.1848,0.0306,0.6443,1.1422,4.8948,4.6122,1.9396,1.2766,6.7376,1.0319,1.1455,4.2203,3.0907,3.1795,0.0349,1.2512,4.4129,4.7096,0.3276,5.0997,8.1919,1.0649,4.0982,2.4971,0.6488,1.3892,1.286,2.4044,2.3796,3.0463,5.5384,0.1729,11.5324,3.4872,2.7854,3.0662,4.8014,2.4144,7.4142,3.8101,1.4377,1.9141,2.4246,5.0018,1.447,6.049,1.4662,0.5588,2.8917,0.7828,3.882,0.8589,0.2229,0.2662,1.9296,4.2075,5.0723,2.0916,9.4446,0.0774,2.228,0.3627,1.2628,1.6854,1.3911,4.3261,0.7991,5.6535,5.8232,4.9556,2.8871,5.5354,5.5165,5.4749,1.5179,4.0993,2.4689,2.4711,5.7311,4.8589,3.5328,1.2049,1.7505,2.7812,1.6177,0.355,1.809,2.4499,7.7919,0.1911,6.4442,4.1956,4.6516,4.6616,1.1751,1.6821,2.0278,4.2638,0.0171,0.2926,4.8222,1.4212,7.7925,1.8179,0.6676,1.2866,3.6468,8.3232,1.4675,1.9964,1.2329,8.0871,0.8289,4.4024,1.9237,3.3334,4.9554,6.9435,4.1589,2.8344,0.0096,3.956,0.0023,3.1931,3.5042,0.7938,4.226,7.1316,10.889,8.9772,2.1769,7.0507,1.4686]}

Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a shallow draught","text":"To design and build his ship Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect. Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a shallow draught to allow for ease of construction and to allow for a larger displacement of fuel. Archer was to design a ship called the Nansen, which he had been commissioned to design for the then Directorate of Greenland, the future Canadian Arctic Research Expeditions, and for the Norwegian Hydrographic Institute, and thus had a clear mandate to design an ocean going scientific ship that was capable of long term sea and climate research. He would soon have an opportunity to prove himself on a major expedition that would span both seas.\nThe Nansen proved extremely useful to the Norwegian team.

As the attackers moved forward, their gunners opened fire with all their weapons, and several machine guns were engaged, before the force of attack reached the centre of the town. The first companies of C, D, and E Companies formed up between the railway track and the bridge and advanced to the east and south of the main street. These three companies took heavy casualties before reaching the entrance to San Leonardo. The assault, which commenced in the early morning of 6 December, was interrupted at 2.00 p.m. by an air raid on the town. The attack was again repeated at 3 p.m., but without success. The attack resumed at 9 a.m. on the following morning by F Coy.

It would make sense to call the creature a `` dragon-phoenix-bat Phoenix-Bat ``, but no such name would appear on the box. It is however a very unique name to be sure, and if anyone finds it then it's really their call on what to call it.\nThe use of shadow creatures is primarily to allow the player to control the foe, usually by controlling the movements of the phoenix or the bat. When the player activates his shadow, he can do various things with his foe, such as make damage attacks, attack or even teleport the character away from the enemy.\nThe players shadows can interact with other creatures such as monsters, giving them magic powers. As you might suspect, these are limited, and they can only be used on creatures that don't share the same race as the player character, which means that, for example, phoenix-bats can attack only bats. The shadows can also interact with other objects, taking them into the player's side or preventing them from using their regular attacks.","token_len":254,"entropy":[8.0632,5.823,3.4529,9.019,4.0758,0.9002,1.8516,3.9668,0.0142,6.8183,13.7632,14.1435,2.4352,2.4947,4.0949,3.2401,8.7777,0.3774,1.5566,1.1948,4.5662,3.1095,10.972,0.9472,7.2111,1.5533,3.4479,2.864,0.8673,7.19,0.0468,0.3963,1.4849,5.7782,0.356,0.3231,0.4447,6.3133,0.025,4.9282,2.1723,6.2221,0.6702,4.216,5.1036,3.5252,0.1273,0.9459,5.5991,2.0879,5.8133,1.7941,1.9277,4.2724,4.0547,6.7791,0.0184,2.6348,1.6478,8.6956,1.6883,2.7728,3.4801,1.2079,1.709,5.6667,2.509,3.8824,2.4329,2.6694,3.0121,0.8338,5.858,0.823,3.4288,1.4862,5.5973,2.9763,3.3078,3.7453,5.1957,3.6012,3.3067,3.1315,0.8321,1.3067,4.3449,4.294,4.3399,1.5138,6.042,2.0507,2.9205,4.6825,6.3979,4.2501,5.688,3.0504,1.9344,0.6592,1.1229,0.4129,1.73,3.9555,6.4891,0.0081,3.0428,4.2805,1.448,6.3732,3.2362,3.4124,1.6319,0.3927,0.1612,4.2315,1.1727,9.4633,2.1886,6.7229,2.2009,5.0688,1.454,7.0303,0.1287,1.0909,3.9554,0.0093,1.5132,1.6471,1.2237,0.8954,4.3668,1.5692,0.7463,5.3647,4.4348,0.6426,1.3443,1.3395,2.275,4.453,3.7373,0.7279,2.7722,1.8619,6.8885,0.8883,0.9482,0.0049,4.6422,7.123,5.3575,1.2182,2.6968,4.52,5.17,4.4178,3.6895,4.075,4.5736,0.6187,0.5466,2.9199,0.6052,2.4147,1.5758,6.0013,9.0217,2.0064,5.4432,0.1509,2.3496,2.4077,2.868,0.0083,4.0632,0.5909,8.4849,0.4913,6.6061,2.2815,1.3059,4.3365,3.8233,3.2182,4.305,0.3891,3.0722,2.7758,5.0365,3.8453,1.5701,3.5847,1.814,1.9156,0.4913,0.4818,2.9298,2.6898,1.052,4.5127,0.0014,2.9915,1.1633,0.4182,6.6984,1.9244,0.5649,0.4328,3.2603,1.7481,2.7575,1.9453,0.8048,5.0025,2.0183,0.461,0.0402,5.9488,0.0596,2.4303,1.1421,1.7076,4.4216,3.8711,6.4243,1.7902,2.7038,2.9235,1.3863,0.5037,1.9334,0.0525,1.5586,4.3471,1.3217,7.2721,1.8313,2.284,1.6995,1.3559,0.4235,7.2666,3.8035,6.5268,0.288,0.0195,3.6938,1.1664,7.7693,2.5602,0.3589]}

Ribbon @ - @ interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Most Viking jewellery was made of silver and enamel, which can be polished and made shiny, but was unbreakable and hard to repair. Enamelled jewellery, such as earrings, is often highly decorated with animal motifs and geometric patterns. Jewellery was made from a combination of coins, other jewellery, and silver work. Gold and gold alloy rings and necklaces are known as jewellery. All gold used for jewellery had to be recycled from older jewelry. Jewelry was also worn to enhance sexual and social status. The Norse and Viking culture of the Viking age produced some of the most beautiful jewellery designs to come forth since ancient times and in our modern day era when we look back. There are a wide range of jewels which were produced within the world of the Vikings and they were considered to be very fashionable among the common people as well as the noble classes. This was in fact a very influential age for the development of jewellery styles and these were most probably inherited from the time of the Roman Empire.","token_len":254,"entropy":[10.9735,8.7618,14.1233,8.6721,4.6073,1.519,10.1274,0.023,7.7951,1.5662,6.3348,2.9917,0.0048,4.3449,2.8036,5.5166,8.6817,1.3138,5.1558,0.4976,11.9497,12.0383,6.3863,6.4903,9.0068,3.0202,5.469,6.963,4.2742,11.0731,2.645,0.4154,4.1707,5.8586,2.0808,1.5202,9.6765,3.0073,0.4054,0.0008,0.0739,0.8733,6.8176,6.6076,6.0323,0.0123,1.3406,1.4301,1.1776,4.3303,2.2609,8.5951,0.1067,1.5462,2.8734,4.8405,0.5684,6.8361,1.9643,4.3221,6.7476,2.8639,2.1073,5.0417,6.994,3.8087,0.0019,2.5439,4.0198,0.3733,5.0056,0.3481,5.4991,5.474,0.0987,5.0576,0.0194,3.1003,2.4751,0.0009,5.184,0.052,0.5308,4.1131,2.5793,5.7549,3.7612,1.5102,4.0647,0.8252,0.0164,2.3355,6.1201,1.3626,0.5306,8.1215,0.018,2.6543,3.1019,1.5496,3.1069,3.2806,0.0047,6.5285,0.7117,6.2713,3.9533,0.0349,0.9909,1.194,3.3641,7.7976,1.1845,6.0806,3.1954,3.8761,5.4666,5.3139,3.1466,4.6266,0.0219,0.0002,2.0114,4.663,1.3217,4.1325,0.0913,2.1257,5.2856,4.0435,6.0343,2.3804,1.9842,0.0142,4.6503,0.8476,0.1603,6.8999,2.6124,5.1614,6.0174,1.2491,5.26,0.107,1.1471,2.571,4.4952,3.7114,4.568,6.4956,3.23,2.5381,1.9235,0.7071,2.4372,4.7042,4.0272,4.0706,3.4365,3.4063,1.4891,3.5035,2.0184,6.237,4.0123,0.5657,0.0679,0.5677,2.1,2.3726,0.0109,4.5881,4.204,2.9998,5.4399,3.0763,4.7576,0.0895,4.0281,3.9137,4.5931,2.616,0.9621,5.4784,6.5868,1.675,3.9592,0.8691,5.6497,4.7546,0.6074,2.7032,3.3634,0.6859,0.0057,6.7935,3.407,2.7904,2.6948,5.5493,0.6002,5.6172,0.4376,1.8165,2.2585,1.7298,3.0473,1.6908,5.0896,1.3956,0.2158,3.5914,5.4257,5.0953,0.8535,6.0844,1.4759,4.3629,0.8815,0.3801,2.389,5.0179,3.7464,0.4167,4.1638,2.911,4.4624,2.5781,2.2915,2.5281,4.4737,6.1893,1.3075,1.3142,3.3154,0.0578,2.0638,0.0104,6.4475,1.4011,5.6154,2.5426,5.3706,4.729,4.7638,0.555,0.6975,5.2934,0.4797,0.5473,5.2232,0.7305,0.6357]}

Laborers, as they were commonly known, did most of the odd jobs on the railroads and building sites. They earned the low pay of the construction trades and lived on the spot with their families. Women and children, however, were forced to share rundown cottages set close to busy freight yards. The conditions within the camps were appalling. The conditions that were experienced by migrant laborers in the 1890s in Canada were quite different from those of the 1940s and 1950s in the United States. The migrants did not have long periods of employment, as construction work on the Canadian railways was seasonal. The migrants generally moved from one camp to the next. They were not permitted to form trade unions. Consequently, when the work stoppage over the issue of pay and conditions began in October 1940, a large group of migrant workers left, and many families were without food and sleeping accommodations. They eventually returned to their work sites, and only then did the situation get better. During the 1930s, in the United States, some migrant workers were allowed to form labor unions, and others were not. In 1940 and 1941, the situation changed dramatically ( Dyson, 1964 ).","token_len":255,"entropy":[10.4484,4.7654,6.2564,1.438,8.1936,2.0147,6.7339,0.0039,0.5624,9.1315,18.0896,9.3381,7.3952,8.7962,2.5179,4.5071,1.3387,5.6987,0.9016,7.9064,0.0789,4.1113,3.9208,3.4914,2.8406,6.0224,1.135,0.287,3.6776,4.9462,0.0663,0.1571,10.6014,0.5752,3.5271,0.6141,6.9877,2.7756,2.5908,7.7995,3.8073,0.7272,2.4861,6.4854,3.0733,6.425,2.8016,2.0824,1.9751,7.2092,2.1951,1.8792,6.2488,2.0868,0.8345,7.5468,3.6307,0.9112,1.0078,0.5307,7.6042,2.6865,0.8022,3.1039,3.4821,0.018,1.0213,5.0424,0.2558,5.7417,14.0712,6.6733,0.1261,0.0009,8.8724,7.3955,0.5331,6.601,4.411,2.7957,1.0778,2.2591,5.9229,6.8601,1.2479,4.8055,0.6686,3.1669,0.6962,2.2509,3.9576,4.5938,2.0984,5.9644,1.7425,6.6225,1.7261,2.2604,0.9379,7.3479,0.1194,4.5214,5.1119,1.1226,4.881,0.5885,0.92,0.6056,1.7958,0.9732,5.8351,0.0193,1.3198,0.4838,0.0006,1.693,0.9655,0.5369,0.0083,0.3925,1.902,6.2826,4.2369,0.282,1.5285,5.826,4.339,0.3711,3.3986,1.5422,3.6823,7.9554,3.6839,4.2017,1.1274,5.743,1.7288,1.2231,7.5109,1.0868,1.7869,3.0859,6.0135,4.8619,2.3451,1.4186,1.365,0.1468,2.3057,0.1018,2.2369,2.4367,1.6188,2.1872,4.2169,0.1984,7.133,5.7907,0.1695,1.773,6.8103,0.1543,3.9683,1.2519,3.7812,4.5536,0.8914,6.4092,0.7147,5.5597,0.1568,4.3071,2.0225,1.14,2.4016,1.3225,3.5435,5.6177,0.1358,3.4355,2.6746,3.0545,0.1156,3.4028,0.3216,4.9803,4.3378,2.4149,3.0154,7.1027,1.902,6.4045,2.8444,1.5284,5.7969,3.268,0.3926,3.2329,5.6992,2.94,0.4478,1.2648,3.8911,2.7667,1.4412,1.837,5.7134,4.2992,0.3316,1.062,3.7351,2.8828,1.0194,0.2072,4.2821,0.4503,5.0726,0.0319,0.8367,4.3014,1.4683,3.0313,0.0586,0.2448,4.0106,4.3439,0.3434,1.9354,2.8111,0.1393,1.753,3.8298,0.0902,1.3269,1.806,3.6806,0.5473,2.0382,0.2674,2.2398,4.7035,3.9019,0.6941,0.1758,1.5779,4.1177,2.9555,1.3261,7.3847,12.4659,5.7199,1.2089,5.4014,0.357]}

He was also the last emperor whose reign saw the fall of the Roman Empire; he was killed by conspirators in 81.","token_len":255,"entropy":[5.8385,5.0591,4.6181,3.6678,0.5636,4.147,2.3592,4.5168,2.4504,11.6655,1.2572,2.5899,2.9223,0.3837,0.0045,4.543,3.6698,0.1197,4.8661,0.9721,0.0055,0.024,2.4624,8.8927,9.1236,0.7699,0.1211,2.9082,0.0192,0.0154,0.0871,3.877,0.5582,3.0572,5.0912,4.7062,0.1236,11.9568,9.6193,0.8568,1.5351,3.407,3.5989,4.0941,0.9814,0.4638,4.3156,0.101,4.5493,2.5912,2.1835,3.7919,0.4854,0.3732,0.2049,3.3221,2.4491,1.2588,18.1962,0.0076,0.3423,4.7453,1.3031,0.6062,5.1331,0.5487,2.8989,3.3222,5.9591,2.2017,3.7691,0.6645,7.4608,0.0196,0.6586,5.172,3.4045,6.659,0.6671,6.8894,2.0361,3.1127,1.8066,3.9081,7.3411,1.0532,2.2632,5.6953,0.1629,9.1057,0.0087,0.3796,2.5788,0.3603,2.672,0.0036,0.2434,8.7755,2.0114,6.2947,3.9537,5.6971,4.9393,11.3674,4.004,3.2163,3.1721,4.0563,2.1382,3.6317,1.7515,0.9107,0.0179,4.5822,0.0149,0.0007,0.063,4.5628,5.0681,2.7525,5.9798,0.729,1.0096,5.8902,0.8916,4.1083,0.1679,2.3207,1.4762,4.8022,1.1632,0.7201,0.0042,0.0115,1.9927,3.8527,4.3847,0.2271,0.6818,5.4544,2.046,0.0014,0.8995,2.6318,1.3547,2.9467,0.3381,5.9848,0.8203,3.8143,1.3263,0.8601,4.6545,0.1724,0.6706,3.3378,1.3389,0.4929,0.3778,2.3309,3.6553,4.3288,5.4017,1.2878,0.2943,0.8858,3.3208,0.8312,5.671,3.6436,5.4094,5.8648,2.1933,1.2327,5.5685,0.9255,5.0993,3.1405,2.6705,5.8092,3.3476,5.8378,0.0071,0.0,2.3835,4.3596,1.7101,0.5848,0.7642,3.4713,0.3904,2.6393,5.0808,0.9892,2.8949,0.0338,0.9348,3.6684,2.3214,2.5989,2.0069,3.6211,3.8434,3.2557,5.7721,0.3914,5.5255,0.7869,1.2318,1.4734,0.0061,0.0183,1.6664,8.3148,0.138,0.6402,6.8469,1.5403,4.1503,2.9503,0.9878,1.3589,2.2996,3.2021,7.205,2.2074,1.4777,4.7526,2.0218,1.5354,0.8004,1.633,3.0461,3.7012,1.3811,6.2469,4.6737,3.837,1.2439,3.6318,0.0129,1.0348,1.3792,0.7883,4.7711,1.7387,0.7728,2.4129,1.3004,8.6973,0.0304,1.2114,5.5661,1.8041]}

Also, Salvinorin A is effective for reducing chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal distress in rats treated with cytarabine [ 30 ]. These observations indicate that Salvinorin A and other cannabinoids may have a beneficial use in gastroenterology.\nConcluding remarks\nIt is hoped that this review will stimulate further interest in the use of synthetic cannabinoids in medicinal therapy. The recent finding that cannabis, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, potentiates several endogenous cannabinoid systems in the CNS, which may produce significant side effects, could be overcome through co-administration of cannabinoids with other compounds. This strategy has been exploited in the human studies above and could be tested in larger trials as part of medicinal therapy. Another approach will be to co-administer cannabinoids with pharmacoresistant pathologies such as schizophrenia, cancer, immune disorders, obesity, and pain [ 28 ]. The use of synthetic cannabinoids could therefore lead to novel drug discovery, therapeutic strategies and drug candidates to combat a host of important human diseases.","token_len":256,"entropy":[8.6839,7.3315,7.4012,3.506,4.9875,7.5597,0.0037,3.0595,0.0047,9.7464,7.0406,2.5058,0.0343,3.3997,8.6678,0.5323,0.0013,0.7736,7.3782,3.063,7.5009,2.8553,2.7214,0.0379,8.4618,2.9895,14.0312,5.1282,9.577,7.7756,3.3631,6.8482,3.1334,11.5139,3.1612,2.1107,1.9594,0.6031,1.884,3.5274,10.9589,0.0151,6.0901,6.2093,3.617,0.2986,2.9745,0.6978,0.0352,5.8727,5.0142,1.1611,1.7102,6.0552,7.7444,0.7774,6.2441,0.499,9.1452,0.0253,0.0015,0.0019,0.4571,2.0137,3.4265,2.6489,3.0626,10.1636,0.371,0.1568,3.8865,3.441,1.5259,3.0277,3.874,0.0958,7.5563,7.9998,3.5103,0.0279,4.3661,5.6291,0.3964,4.5132,3.5877,2.4827,0.1602,0.6346,0.0059,0.0007,0.0019,0.0383,3.978,2.5302,2.003,1.2423,2.4078,2.1515,2.9025,7.0112,0.4808,8.018,0.0808,0.4881,1.3586,0.942,14.6541,4.0091,0.5775,1.0386,4.3639,0.7343,5.0378,0.0218,1.7856,1.0943,0.7552,4.0851,1.4378,4.2787,0.1521,0.7763,2.6337,0.0528,6.2523,0.7146,1.1606,6.5918,5.3831,0.9447,2.2382,4.4296,4.7325,0.7576,4.684,4.3669,4.4985,6.9033,2.1323,2.9775,2.1961,0.3617,6.3409,0.0437,5.1979,5.0714,1.9074,1.7049,2.5602,1.8625,3.7789,2.1702,3.5629,1.6156,7.3037,3.7524,3.2689,0.1054,1.0899,3.2237,1.7436,9.1842,2.7912,8.9056,0.105,0.9802,0.009,1.0142,2.5095,0.6255,1.019,3.0556,0.989,2.7245,6.6665,2.7788,0.8982,7.117,1.1099,1.4473,5.292,4.6979,6.7248,2.0131,2.3526,1.2257,5.3743,0.4235,5.1638,3.5291,3.5433,3.6593,0.0011,8.8469,1.8448,0.72,5.5088,3.1211,4.5401,0.2632,0.2811,7.6039,0.0118,2.7984,0.0021,1.938,0.9729,5.1743,10.0689,0.3353,8.0434,2.3283,2.1571,0.0041,6.5294,1.062,3.9501,0.3141,6.1446,2.3476,0.3856,5.0759,0.3595,1.5036,5.7266,2.6612,4.5972,0.7907,2.5816,2.8071,0.0145,1.6989,0.1582,2.4067,4.3837,3.0685,0.0307,3.3095,4.6064,2.2416,2.453,3.9938,4.3665,2.7216,4.5016,4.6062,3.3034,4.8794,4.4919,3.814,0.0032,5.6688,3.8685,0.7404,0.8549]}

The students get up and walk off stage, and the audience boo them.","token_len":258,"entropy":[8.0223,3.8444,0.2743,4.9868,0.1501,8.1911,4.2179,6.4372,8.5426,6.4205,0.4768,0.2841,9.4326,2.6321,0.2557,13.3212,4.9073,3.374,6.7878,2.5703,8.8716,2.6909,3.254,5.7251,10.2999,1.903,0.459,2.2856,9.6474,4.4564,0.3684,10.6417,1.1187,0.2332,7.2862,0.8169,2.0167,10.66,0.692,6.7071,0.9627,5.853,6.5168,1.719,6.3003,0.0334,0.0268,7.3651,1.0552,4.5712,1.0128,5.5568,1.3914,2.2678,4.7741,3.652,2.7926,1.8371,6.1361,6.2195,2.028,0.1199,1.4971,3.2668,6.9097,3.7098,7.5475,3.8407,6.7005,4.5544,0.8399,1.4066,12.0942,5.3771,2.7614,9.3052,0.4945,4.0612,7.4417,8.129,0.4695,4.7488,5.0303,3.853,8.1151,2.84,5.1962,0.1085,4.9105,0.1831,0.5732,1.2341,0.2017,6.6859,2.343,1.6658,5.9884,1.4885,1.844,0.8669,1.5599,0.2345,3.0014,7.5871,3.1535,2.0588,0.6069,4.9693,4.8589,0.0558,2.1418,2.0936,5.2253,7.0003,1.446,3.4018,4.7577,1.9707,5.5148,4.57,1.2185,3.3769,3.8133,0.0844,2.8088,6.0877,3.9203,5.4573,4.4213,6.1646,0.0011,1.8356,3.2438,4.7591,0.0967,3.1509,6.4811,1.2628,1.7118,4.2497,3.345,3.5627,6.3615,0.33,4.4827,4.6052,2.5235,2.8518,2.6966,0.0319,2.9626,3.2556,0.937,5.8391,3.2659,2.371,1.8763,5.6438,2.87,1.8615,0.6591,2.5915,7.7157,4.4314,0.2008,3.7726,0.3786,2.7145,1.9658,2.3508,3.6635,6.1438,3.0647,3.4761,1.8037,2.5952,2.2183,10.8956,1.1504,6.3614,2.2684,0.7669,0.5824,0.0205,1.314,5.3393,3.7772,0.536,2.5618,0.1223,6.9806,4.7879,0.8802,0.0451,5.136,1.8258,3.4579,0.1412,3.9258,1.6999,2.0904,3.7017,0.9929,2.0757,7.1386,3.7519,2.4906,4.6301,0.2478,6.3046,2.4748,2.2907,2.9532,6.6353,3.2416,3.0553,4.1942,4.8728,4.3815,1.9328,3.5494,6.8581,3.0614,1.2779,3.4705,1.9817,3.0763,7.3274,4.1778,1.7031,0.5867,2.1586,1.9618,2.9043,2.7075,1.3672,5.46,0.0849,0.1921,1.4388,5.1591,0.5448,2.2483,2.594,4.8265,2.1413,0.6155,3.6878,2.5063,3.626,1.2557,3.1068,2.1609,5.022,5.0543,3.2759,1.26]}

They become a superhero duo, calling themselves Super Power Monster Inc., to help out the town. Bart even gives them the Super Powers of Spiderman, and they are capable of fighting crime. In the process, they save the day a time and again, though not without running the occasional rundown. They save one day from a villain, the Mad Scientist, but he soon gets another villain to take matters into his own hands. The Mad Scientist also does, but the town does not. The citizens of Springfield are scared of being left alone and Bart calls on the superhero duo to get them out of their misery. They save the day once again, but all is not what it seems. The story ends with a scene where Bart and Super Power, along with their parents, board a plane to an imaginary country where the villagers are happy and living a life of bliss. After a final scene that features Bart, Super Power, and the Mad Scientist reuniting to solve the problem of Springfield, it concludes ( as far as the original movie goes ) with a montage of Homer and Milhouse asking why the people do not get the Super Powers they deserve.","token_len":258,"entropy":[7.7977,11.0266,5.6836,5.4841,10.8233,7.5886,9.5273,13.6972,5.6126,11.9019,0.0681,3.0211,6.0086,10.5769,2.334,3.1579,0.0113,8.9817,1.0265,3.2208,4.6527,7.0643,3.0435,13.2397,9.5266,5.2707,1.1047,5.4221,5.4781,3.2181,6.2629,2.8955,2.0338,8.3457,0.3601,4.9927,6.5851,6.8204,6.9046,2.9663,4.4221,2.5252,3.6566,1.9371,4.2993,1.1645,3.0965,6.0895,4.6834,2.4334,2.0019,5.3093,3.6738,1.7688,5.0609,2.0262,1.376,3.727,2.6273,2.8805,6.3515,0.0535,3.8874,4.2801,1.3939,3.6057,1.3319,4.6754,0.332,0.6777,4.4477,1.0469,3.1589,6.8283,6.3478,3.4349,3.6423,1.4325,5.516,3.0816,2.7776,6.4808,4.5179,8.3503,11.9513,0.8017,3.2351,6.1127,5.7081,4.406,3.2819,1.4585,4.8706,2.1961,4.0304,6.4119,2.2383,0.7854,2.6615,2.7563,5.1406,2.9557,6.5562,5.3587,2.1219,2.7715,7.3315,0.1002,0.0765,0.0087,0.0076,0.5441,2.8925,1.7148,0.0154,4.4851,5.2078,6.234,2.458,3.4111,4.5032,4.7852,0.1527,1.7674,2.4748,7.0476,1.4137,3.1475,2.1677,5.6079,1.3075,4.7773,4.1311,0.7294,2.3114,5.219,6.4164,2.6213,1.2438,5.6602,2.7879,0.5897,4.0113,2.4031,1.073,0.1929,2.0036,3.2959,0.3122,2.5736,6.162,1.0745,0.6686,4.8092,0.609,0.5529,1.3889,5.8015,2.2643,0.1508,4.0078,0.1329,0.1484,0.4856,2.0132,5.2231,1.6278,0.9519,2.0869,4.516,0.9871,1.1252,1.9844,4.7675,0.4019,6.5745,3.8819,0.0015,2.9226,4.9946,0.4521,7.3754,0.5837,1.2283,0.9765,5.0746,5.3948,4.3072,1.851,2.0957,7.3663,1.417,3.7702,1.7429,5.6218,4.0631,2.7023,0.9468,4.9975,0.4786,4.3018,2.037,6.0338,3.0466,4.3125,4.432,2.2787,2.9477,1.6337,0.0597,0.8835,0.4686,2.0711,1.5591,0.0097,7.08,0.1991,3.279,5.4108,0.7843,2.8039,1.5521,4.0977,2.17,3.4443,5.369,7.1006,9.6565,5.761,0.0117,2.9366,4.9294,3.9457,1.1076,2.0866,0.9187,1.4148,4.9092,0.0006,0.3912,5.2368,1.8018,9.2787,0.7612,7.4112,4.7608,1.9181,4.4383,5.5806,0.4473,3.6409,2.7658,5.7491,0.212,2.3684,2.0476,0.3209]}

This iteration of US @ - @ 50 has its origins in a dispute over the route of Interstate 70 in California. The dispute stemmed from the fact that the US @ - @ 50 is one of only two Interstates that was planned without a concurrent interstate route in the same direction at its first stage of planning. The existing Interstate 70 was to the west and the new Interstate 70 to the east. US Route 150 to the southwest and the California State Route 130B to the northeast were also planned, but both eventualities were decided not to be completed.\nWhen US 150 was eventually rerouted to bypass the city of Richmond, the existing US @ - @ 50 was used on its entire length as California US 30. The US @ - @ 50 originally had no intent for the interstate route to go entirely through the cities of Bakersfield and Fresno, and a bypass was constructed between the cities. The interstate's first branch into Fresno was named US @ - @ 50S, and the first section of US @ - @ 50 in Bakersfield was named US @ - @ 50B. The bypasses in Fresno and Bakersfield remained until 2003, while US @ - @ 50B was removed from California in 1990.","token_len":260,"entropy":[8.5543,9.1472,2.3334,8.0602,11.0647,7.8959,4.5895,7.7039,6.6726,4.5385,1.5029,4.9316,1.5252,3.3048,7.9983,1.7899,3.7278,0.5678,1.9685,0.1922,0.5214,2.9491,5.0463,2.8288,0.1819,3.0197,6.7175,1.1398,1.446,3.5792,1.2702,6.4024,3.2742,2.0615,3.3082,0.6121,1.7001,2.9766,4.6314,0.041,1.2945,1.626,0.0192,1.186,1.8033,3.1305,0.4318,0.0806,0.2432,2.5659,3.8825,0.1009,2.157,1.3639,8.6248,0.0702,2.4202,4.0403,6.9544,7.4419,1.5743,9.6086,3.2586,3.8539,3.2191,1.5403,4.6948,3.3319,3.756,5.4197,4.7989,4.7013,0.9881,4.4627,0.3431,1.6589,6.2415,2.4375,1.221,2.2561,3.0652,6.49,1.4378,2.5329,2.0192,2.3968,0.8178,0.5016,2.8778,0.0502,0.2029,0.4532,3.9636,4.9513,7.394,5.0604,1.5717,3.6988,3.0647,3.623,4.9781,4.1741,0.9203,4.2294,9.2905,0.3942,0.0939,2.0296,0.9618,3.2242,1.4393,3.0793,0.6486,3.6501,9.8775,1.7891,0.5831,5.2773,4.2913,0.1654,1.3662,2.1621,1.6504,1.8799,7.8987,1.7496,9.0204,0.9843,6.6396,6.1965,2.5363,0.0005,0.8205,5.9024,1.4414,7.215,0.3311,5.8711,0.7209,1.6312,4.7599,1.6651,1.6239,0.1017,0.213,0.1934,1.4225,4.3456,4.1885,3.3175,5.7296,1.0908,2.7884,7.207,6.6991,7.4251,0.8848,1.8432,2.4435,0.3442,0.0787,0.0106,0.0449,6.0918,2.4127,3.6854,7.7304,4.674,1.8872,4.1517,1.1259,1.6861,4.1537,7.3431,1.393,1.132,4.4205,0.4067,6.039,0.0566,0.0004,0.7466,2.804,1.2258,2.333,5.0495,8.0517,1.7952,3.9429,3.2733,1.4684,2.3843,1.2333,1.7493,5.3459,7.2289,4.0967,8.4654,6.3909,2.3158,0.8296,5.5792,1.504,3.6142,0.4626,0.1071,1.232,9.3671,1.8306,1.2818,1.5883,3.2212,3.3543,0.6077,0.7064,0.9868,0.0627,0.0534,0.1611,4.5751,2.4123,0.0021,0.0002,0.5372,0.9877,0.1999,0.4369,0.1553,0.0221,0.2896,2.6377,0.2387,1.8117,4.9256,5.2862,3.4078,1.062,0.9802,0.8552,0.0014,0.0005,6.0215,4.1996,6.5473,0.9757,5.954,1.3296,0.4893,0.0251,0.0242,0.0436,2.2017,0.4373,4.3605,0.9305,4.2405,4.5526,7.3573,0.3942]}

While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and in favor of her own candidacy, in 1954 and 1959 she openly criticized the voting policies of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n \u2013 especially regarding women with young offspring. The Per\u00f3nites wanted her removed from office; she was succeeded by her daughter, Isabel, in 1963. Per\u00f3n also tried to exclude women voters from the congressional lists of his political parties.\nIn 1977, the constitution was changed so that women could serve in the legislature and as candidates for President.\nThe first-ever female Speaker of the House of Representatives of Argentina, the right-wing Gabriela Michetti, was a prominent member of the conservative Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), which advocated a very limited role for women. Michetti herself did not support the law that would have granted Argentina's first democratically elected indigenous (woman) President. However, from 1995 to 1998, the Per\u00f3nist legislature passed a law allowing women to run as presidential candidates. The first woman elected to the presidency by a party opposed to the Peronist party was Gabriela Mistral in 1951.","token_len":260,"entropy":[10.5752,13.0989,0.9995,8.7797,1.3024,4.5029,1.8233,12.2706,6.6584,4.7715,4.8677,4.9577,1.0259,4.1067,0.7378,7.2094,2.0023,4.0793,0.1494,3.5432,2.4375,7.8139,4.7055,1.5639,4.9183,3.9396,4.2554,5.269,10.4233,6.6687,1.5757,3.5674,0.0466,2.5162,0.484,1.3415,0.0008,2.4091,3.4908,1.7928,0.0065,4.7176,1.7296,2.7595,0.8493,4.3215,7.828,4.5031,3.8555,0.5546,5.6705,3.2713,0.9111,5.632,7.0463,0.1629,6.9657,5.7661,1.2738,0.6638,4.4284,0.1016,5.8327,7.1874,4.9212,1.9504,6.5085,4.908,7.9978,0.5051,3.1626,4.3212,0.2583,4.1834,5.4351,4.5248,5.2688,0.3493,1.8475,5.1764,1.7566,1.3962,6.4725,0.2357,1.783,2.2488,1.1085,4.1795,2.5498,2.4497,3.5446,0.4343,3.6551,0.0047,3.6019,4.5828,0.1721,5.6745,2.3978,5.6029,0.7667,0.9277,6.5062,6.6531,0.8362,5.3148,3.2725,1.7237,0.8954,1.8102,7.9961,5.6969,0.5094,2.3977,6.7762,1.8425,2.1183,2.4491,0.073,2.2298,0.9552,4.5177,0.9447,1.0982,3.4969,2.2496,3.6769,3.4748,0.9484,5.3131,0.8574,2.9504,2.6282,3.8601,5.7489,0.8431,3.964,6.2917,0.3796,0.1418,0.2939,0.5893,0.0345,4.6033,0.9526,1.3805,4.4512,5.7919,0.5162,0.2403,7.9821,0.8742,0.1026,9.0779,5.0912,0.7291,0.8785,4.2332,4.4048,1.8549,0.0131,0.3599,4.0319,6.302,2.7895,0.0404,4.3092,9.443,0.7468,0.2933,0.0237,2.8857,8.9113,0.2865,0.9542,2.4332,1.1061,1.0302,1.3735,4.0124,2.4506,6.7778,2.8204,3.1028,0.1734,0.0644,1.8035,3.6606,0.0005,6.21,4.4452,0.2128,2.5905,1.3651,6.365,2.3965,2.1222,0.6219,4.9429,5.7534,1.6901,3.0081,5.2393,0.0544,9.0854,6.2591,4.1644,0.2201,4.2561,2.9395,3.5591,0.0562,6.882,5.0242,0.7973,2.2254,0.7661,2.4546,6.7184,0.6571,3.348,5.8603,2.2679,1.1647,0.7331,3.1651,0.5231,0.2969,2.1914,2.6337,3.7452,0.0825,0.9329,2.3631,3.6903,1.6336,1.6897,0.676,0.5055,2.3335,3.6874,0.9745,2.9141,7.435,0.0655,0.8762,2.7161,4.5297,0.481,1.8038,0.9967,4.1069,0.0508,0.0161,11.5206,2.5686,4.4667,8.9864,0.3549]}

Although a minor storm of the Atlantic, it was the strongest hurricane of the season.\nThe final hurricane of the season occurred on August 30. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) was able to place a Tropical Cyclone Warning on the French Eastern Mediterranean for 12 nautical miles along and between the coast of Morocco and Algeria due to a low pressure area extending between Argelia and Morocco. During the hurricane, which struck the Mediterranean Sea with strong winds to produce torrential rainfall, gusts up to 50 to 60 miles per hour (80 to 90\u00a0km\/h) (31 to 38\u00a0kn) were recorded at Sidi Ifni. This is the strongest hurricane activity in the Atlantic since the 2005 season.","token_len":261,"entropy":[7.2537,9.9992,2.7543,0.6016,2.1024,2.3753,6.3341,6.7225,6.7869,0.0187,5.3089,5.9665,4.5709,6.5352,1.7461,3.9133,5.3825,2.8039,0.8756,6.3035,4.8582,11.507,8.3019,4.375,4.6073,5.6066,2.5328,4.037,2.2654,4.4146,3.5091,0.8357,7.1188,7.1056,2.5784,1.9793,5.3775,0.0318,0.1234,9.5379,0.3348,1.332,3.4958,3.8117,7.6394,10.0344,1.6068,0.2089,0.4567,3.9752,5.1857,2.7695,0.6489,0.0226,1.5643,5.9794,1.674,6.3027,11.1637,6.4637,10.3285,0.2955,2.2464,2.3503,2.8586,2.4408,3.2391,10.1716,0.2275,4.6461,6.4006,2.4859,2.0263,0.7098,2.417,0.5897,3.7768,0.4783,0.8155,0.5596,2.8667,4.3992,0.9622,1.6357,3.1346,6.6528,3.2511,1.0679,1.4349,0.9881,7.6481,7.1807,0.1315,7.8558,2.3982,0.2414,0.7708,1.6205,1.8679,1.5523,5.1717,0.7289,5.34,1.9435,4.1005,2.4247,0.8486,1.0069,2.1511,4.8062,2.8121,3.8066,0.0028,0.699,5.5937,1.6678,5.1814,3.7413,5.7394,1.8929,4.3304,0.6348,4.0827,1.8403,1.0891,0.9314,2.7675,2.4136,1.4228,1.1051,0.1718,0.6612,1.4562,1.5318,1.6781,5.0506,0.6292,0.522,0.0558,0.2115,4.5645,0.2967,1.2187,2.173,2.1289,1.6361,4.8165,0.9231,1.1136,2.1416,0.5349,0.0186,0.0946,3.7607,3.4403,0.0035,5.3601,1.5676,6.8516,3.3811,0.0001,2.4234,3.2665,0.9678,5.1937,7.0171,2.626,4.2662,6.1845,7.4555,0.001,0.0114,5.899,7.1882,3.9259,0.4271,2.9714,0.321,4.6988,0.3461,2.7733,6.3909,0.0061,2.2321,3.9189,1.4222,4.6972,7.0153,3.9156,11.3479,6.2668,0.5121,4.2504,0.3723,5.0146,0.7233,2.8126,0.9066,4.0592,3.9644,1.6803,3.5517,2.1929,4.323,4.3447,0.1125,5.4824,5.7967,4.5042,0.0255,3.1391,0.4742,6.083,0.1871,3.1232,0.0064,3.2706,3.5065,1.2646,1.3622,0.8657,0.0134,1.4879,3.3925,0.2988,2.9258,3.7195,1.7519,1.3806,0.0706,0.9611,5.0248,7.6757,0.712,3.1115,0.788,8.7924,1.8917,1.9606,0.529,4.1234,8.8128,1.6738,11.0788,7.5056,2.0304,3.0322,2.9212,1.1523,2.4676,1.5452,6.8703,1.2861,0.5853,1.6259,1.7735,1.4356,5.7382,5.3908,0.6176]}

At the end of March 2013, McCall was announced as an assistant coach to former Northern Ireland and Scottish international goalkeeper Dean Henderson.\nMcCall became a full-fledged assistant for City at the start of the 2014\u201315 season. Under McCall, City won promotion to The Championship as champions of The Northern Premier League for the first time in their history, defeating Newport County 4-3 in the playoff final. Along with City, McCall won promotion into the Championship after defeating Kidderminster Harriers at Wembley Stadium 2\u20131 on penalties in the play-off semi-final. It was the second time in City's history there had been two consecutive promotions, with the previous time around being won in the 1980\u201381 season. Following promotion, McCall was appointed as assistant coach of newly-promoted Championship club Brighton & Hove Albion on 4 August 2014 following the departure of former Scotland defender Mark Robins. He left the club at the end of the season after the club failed to sign a number of players such as Danny Welbeck and Ryan Ledley in the January transfer window, and a new coach was subsequently appointed.","token_len":261,"entropy":[7.8279,9.9749,1.0983,6.0226,2.9067,7.5952,4.0938,0.0784,5.2407,0.8744,0.7928,3.2982,4.3536,2.8292,6.9443,1.1017,5.889,1.8801,0.4089,3.4827,1.3813,10.9884,1.1674,5.5094,7.5092,9.2385,4.423,1.8606,7.35,2.3181,9.1096,0.2527,5.3373,0.9959,2.141,0.011,4.6615,4.0051,0.251,1.324,0.005,1.2267,5.8459,0.2158,3.1633,0.943,1.3225,2.6259,3.4086,6.6163,0.3169,3.3937,3.1327,2.9014,4.9421,5.1789,7.7444,0.8486,0.5155,14.6915,0.0544,4.8639,1.447,3.0548,0.1305,5.43,1.2352,3.7935,5.8394,2.2633,0.311,1.368,0.0037,0.7843,1.2834,6.4751,0.0176,0.2719,1.5276,5.5687,2.8277,0.0053,0.8221,0.8966,1.8169,3.1033,0.3189,7.6743,1.6437,4.4586,5.9651,2.1101,5.1224,6.9629,3.831,0.1339,4.2181,0.3469,0.4354,0.0378,0.9189,2.2627,0.8545,1.9302,2.9843,7.8392,2.0101,2.3253,0.1067,2.3625,0.9988,0.381,8.2194,1.6805,0.8677,6.6567,0.756,4.8982,1.2592,0.5239,0.0031,3.9608,3.4706,5.8066,0.4117,2.8005,3.3864,2.7991,10.7823,0.3731,0.0059,7.791,0.059,3.4605,2.1344,1.8639,3.504,3.7934,0.8472,2.5382,4.4408,1.4907,0.5121,4.6749,0.0303,0.3933,1.6311,0.0459,0.2271,0.4672,5.538,0.3061,1.6678,2.1098,0.4293,0.6081,3.8564,0.0732,1.1782,6.8665,1.9702,0.2587,2.909,2.3008,4.0983,2.2485,2.8684,1.1685,1.968,3.1869,11.0183,1.3731,5.6469,2.0219,3.2526,6.0808,2.3093,0.061,0.2865,0.6434,5.6146,4.5571,0.9971,0.4128,0.002,1.5571,2.0688,1.5158,1.9706,1.6305,1.8085,7.5592,2.4573,1.4692,0.0006,5.1382,2.5701,3.6597,1.9094,0.003,0.0002,0.0002,2.5366,3.5118,2.546,1.0532,5.1773,1.6019,1.5421,0.0182,2.6491,5.312,3.1195,3.9822,6.122,1.6785,0.5166,3.2511,4.4543,1.353,0.6571,3.5014,0.0533,0.1603,0.0005,0.8919,0.8604,2.5566,2.6975,1.34,2.7464,0.0401,3.7764,1.5654,6.8279,0.0087,1.3395,6.0869,0.0024,4.6381,3.1079,0.0,1.0939,4.5977,7.4549,0.1347,3.472,0.5084,3.443,1.2123,0.0146,2.3176,1.5779,4.8097,3.7226,2.5009,1.0027,6.1608,0.3626,0.8893]}

But with the introduction of the miniature AI computer, the company intends to move away from this strategy.","token_len":261,"entropy":[12.1426,3.7616,9.1396,2.3714,2.9267,1.9035,1.6486,7.848,13.6918,7.6775,5.4988,0.6335,2.5457,5.7304,8.7507,1.9054,3.0618,9.1602,6.3145,11.7334,3.5063,1.7341,1.3287,5.9017,5.4083,0.4952,0.8626,1.9034,0.679,3.9113,4.3533,3.9378,1.3407,3.8186,4.5717,0.0577,0.9904,0.2107,4.2008,5.1304,5.6131,5.9703,0.4756,1.5376,6.265,2.8788,1.1027,5.2944,0.2829,1.2295,3.4815,9.1519,4.6125,5.9335,2.8522,1.9706,2.9191,1.2951,4.9204,1.3678,2.4576,4.1522,2.8744,5.4468,4.5064,2.3215,3.0892,5.3053,6.9921,3.0552,0.077,0.1692,4.8135,7.7233,1.587,3.3837,6.384,0.0868,2.3224,7.263,2.0424,0.0642,0.0083,0.0398,2.8105,1.2196,3.335,1.171,1.7537,1.2366,3.2322,2.453,5.1821,1.7474,5.5039,3.8528,0.0492,4.3551,0.1606,10.332,6.367,1.0787,4.065,0.0431,5.6091,0.8326,2.1305,5.6107,3.4145,1.6477,2.8195,4.2389,4.1928,2.4194,4.0557,3.5235,6.0079,3.9884,4.9648,1.4796,7.8261,1.8262,4.6367,2.5015,4.4688,1.0768,5.2636,0.0551,4.5673,0.2672,1.7222,1.0481,1.3765,2.5487,0.2606,1.7258,3.904,1.4644,0.8306,1.9386,3.1635,2.0793,3.2241,2.7001,3.8734,6.0753,1.2662,6.4077,0.0621,2.4442,4.8893,4.603,4.1747,0.1189,0.6007,5.9458,11.6393,0.1655,8.1157,1.8819,1.2728,7.6092,8.7646,5.4832,5.9228,1.8901,0.4742,8.1919,0.796,4.9134,1.8481,6.7447,3.8146,1.5404,4.9386,2.3675,6.1135,0.454,3.5292,2.7343,5.0805,1.9273,0.0024,2.0273,4.6331,5.1509,4.8284,3.4324,2.0727,4.0564,3.6856,1.4693,0.3947,1.589,1.8943,7.014,2.6295,7.0725,0.4667,0.2754,4.0972,2.1659,4.7516,1.7327,2.0629,1.2911,1.446,2.3197,7.1603,3.9409,0.6504,3.6075,2.107,3.8774,1.2606,1.9154,4.2341,3.8395,4.4138,1.6293,1.5889,1.5467,6.4466,3.3436,0.3894,3.7466,0.4611,1.5225,3.0636,2.0465,4.7174,0.0293,5.4249,2.5166,4.4176,2.1703,4.7953,1.6352,0.0801,0.5132,5.5775,2.695,0.8335,1.5265,0.0147,0.9489,9.2248,0.93,0.9185,0.3893,1.2876,1.4339,5.1159,0.0554,3.0542,0.6997,0.0068,1.5211,1.8573,0.7773]}

The game's original lead designer, Keith Baker, was replaced by James M. Hodges ( the original lead programmer for Mad Doc who left the company after Looking Glass closed ), who would continue on to work on Jane's Austen - The Movie Video Game. Several of the game's original staff remained on the job as consultants for Looking Glass in order to help create and develop their new title. Despite this, the majority of this same production team would work on Jane's Attack Squadron, and the game would be released on November 12 of that same year.\nThe game has now been re-released and has become available on the PlayStation 2, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, GameCube, and Windows platforms. It has also been ported to several Game Boy Advance consoles, as well as mobile platforms and handheld devices. The Game Boy Advance version has been criticized due to the lack of animation, which was meant to give the game a handheld feel in order to attract mobile gamers. It has also gone un-noted and was considered a poorly received game overall, having received a fairly low Rating of 72 out of 100 by GameSpot.","token_len":262,"entropy":[2.3183,7.9369,0.4191,12.7603,0.2151,0.9961,9.5546,3.9494,3.7117,4.7719,0.8609,5.6224,0.9382,10.7717,7.6349,11.1713,8.792,1.0701,3.12,3.8397,6.6455,0.4906,5.6403,12.5427,0.8086,10.4768,10.6231,1.655,2.725,2.8326,2.3096,3.91,6.9169,0.5941,0.5865,6.3637,6.0025,0.117,1.6846,3.4469,0.4173,4.6873,4.71,1.2937,7.0464,0.3326,3.6354,9.7692,3.168,3.0369,2.3048,1.5782,4.9283,0.0667,7.7596,2.6631,1.9507,0.7486,2.6052,7.1813,0.0002,3.0252,2.519,1.4141,3.4821,4.1059,2.8365,1.4867,2.0703,0.4481,5.211,0.0682,13.8205,0.0391,6.1976,3.5994,5.7496,9.5383,0.6367,1.3664,6.6424,1.8591,0.6294,1.7424,0.0198,2.6461,3.4119,4.6586,1.4209,1.439,4.5472,3.3474,5.3547,2.6222,2.4788,0.0003,4.2053,3.2613,0.0294,2.3232,3.5607,3.3871,2.0013,4.7985,4.1073,3.2411,0.7655,6.0971,2.1233,0.4765,1.671,6.1796,0.0415,5.6212,8.3145,5.7349,0.7066,3.432,3.33,0.6546,2.0883,0.0263,0.2022,0.4139,1.5542,1.734,2.3466,1.2552,2.0303,2.1062,1.0806,1.6942,3.8873,3.5513,5.4937,1.611,3.2585,0.0055,0.4067,1.2665,4.805,1.2613,4.2968,4.2529,0.4096,3.4046,0.4458,0.1397,3.6605,2.8438,3.5835,3.1372,1.5136,2.1238,1.3825,2.964,1.4349,3.5283,3.7408,0.2467,3.2848,2.9535,0.3127,3.0969,0.4897,0.2393,1.1138,0.0391,0.2861,5.187,0.9218,0.247,1.4784,3.7993,5.9438,0.3423,2.521,2.0363,0.8976,0.3306,1.795,0.2876,3.8749,6.7076,1.5189,1.0459,2.7568,1.1927,2.8669,0.0845,0.033,5.7828,1.9699,3.2691,3.4242,2.4057,0.3823,2.0584,4.5449,0.2657,0.0812,0.8417,2.8795,1.283,7.1592,4.8786,0.0089,1.1268,2.3367,0.0035,5.9476,1.2544,2.4838,1.722,6.225,0.125,3.6134,0.8888,0.8081,0.8169,9.9928,0.4346,4.5933,2.6423,0.0807,5.1607,6.8405,1.763,0.5618,3.1679,1.3306,0.3704,6.8389,5.9653,2.4798,9.4183,0.6632,5.2478,2.8274,4.3796,1.2966,6.4306,2.2739,1.5495,5.527,1.7304,4.2037,1.9651,1.9009,6.8494,1.6224,7.712,1.318,7.5768,2.3677,0.0016,0.3853,4.18,1.9683,2.2914,0.944]}

Cattle farming accounts for the majority of agricultural output in rural areas of Wales, and milk production was estimated at around 2.1 million litres in 2016. Large-scale dairy farming is mainly centered in Swansea, with many of the local farmers exporting milk to the UK's Northern regions, and even internationally. The Swansea dairy is among the country's largest and most successful, exporting up to 600,000 litres of milk per week to countries such as Germany. On the other hand, although sheep farming is also practiced in much of rural Wales, and the Blackwood cow was once the state cow of Wales, it has declined in recent decades due in part to the increasing scale and efficiency of agriculture, coupled with increased consumption of milk and meat in developed nations.\nGeography and Climate\n\nEconomy\n\nEducation\n\nCuisine\n\nInfluence of Gaelic\n\nCultural life\n\nSport\n\nWeather\n\nPopular folklore\n\nCultural and religious history\n\nLiterature\n\nLanguage\n\nWelsh in United States\n\nWelsh in India\n\nWelsh in United Kingdom\n\nWelsh in France\n\nWelsh in Wales","token_len":262,"entropy":[4.6909,3.9651,0.0108,6.9419,10.0003,9.0872,1.9517,6.3592,1.7369,2.8988,1.6577,3.5817,6.1844,2.7131,4.2597,2.4131,2.1507,6.0132,0.2836,0.405,3.617,0.0034,3.4886,5.6583,0.9259,6.7029,2.2206,8.0588,7.6478,0.0407,3.2457,0.9672,0.0244,6.5737,2.6772,0.5006,6.2058,1.8351,1.8385,0.3278,1.0618,1.4089,7.41,1.415,4.3669,4.7565,1.6247,2.0563,2.901,1.0213,3.0241,0.6679,1.9031,1.7082,4.9657,0.4426,7.7492,2.2533,0.1292,1.8966,1.5088,1.6333,5.7535,7.0159,0.4299,7.68,0.9846,1.6811,3.7794,2.6091,0.3369,2.9545,3.6438,5.7789,2.0216,0.894,1.5018,1.2722,6.3046,6.5538,2.6466,2.2792,2.0963,5.4879,7.4524,0.3326,2.6517,7.2555,2.1968,5.4868,5.038,0.1988,4.1255,0.0074,1.069,2.7039,0.6376,2.3068,3.3015,4.2572,3.644,0.0064,4.6805,0.5966,0.002,0.4478,0.4383,0.1234,1.5979,3.1685,1.2517,5.6117,1.1267,0.0022,2.9343,3.1209,6.4843,1.6541,0.8863,0.1359,0.0396,6.6056,7.2245,2.8448,0.8356,3.8019,5.6233,0.6966,5.953,0.2174,5.467,0.0656,0.1572,4.8085,2.6959,7.8062,10.802,4.8068,3.3766,2.9296,2.8543,5.1444,4.6116,0.991,0.4116,0.2924,1.1461,1.4371,5.2563,1.1696,0.8044,1.864,2.1695,3.4415,0.3691,0.0021,1.4947,3.9314,6.0992,2.1657,5.0069,0.0681,5.2537,2.8583,6.6011,0.0014,3.5232,5.3062,0.3932,2.0237,1.7415,3.1405,3.3574,7.3147,2.7137,0.289,1.227,14.6084,0.8961,1.4806,4.7187,1.4382,7.0814,8.3521,0.8623,2.1043,0.0001,7.6731,0.4455,0.0001,10.5219,1.4731,0.5113,0.0002,6.3608,0.4739,1.1753,9.6579,0.0179,1.6282,0.0002,3.6139,1.6711,4.7931,1.1168,0.0002,7.09,0.5637,0.0002,7.2611,0.4761,0.0002,6.3178,0.8084,7.7157,0.6753,0.0003,3.0445,1.433,2.8856,2.1758,3.8496,0.2188,0.0003,5.4787,0.2428,0.3503,0.0003,4.6166,0.3614,0.0002,4.7946,0.3483,6.2244,9.2771,1.9886,0.5566,0.0002,2.0481,0.0325,1.0711,6.0062,0.1763,0.0002,0.907,0.0073,0.5786,5.5107,0.0182,0.172,0.0002,0.7403,0.0071,0.3882,3.3278,0.2291,0.0002,0.4282,0.0036,0.1391,4.3238]}

The first degree burns are commonly divided into two categories: blister burns and nonblister burns. Blister burns are those in which the epidermis is lacerated (usually with a razor blade), in some cases the dermis will be involved, and the superficial or medium sized blood vessels will be ruptured leading to superficial bleeding at the burn site. Partial thickness burns affect up to a third of the total body surface area ( 30%), resulting in redness, swelling, and warmth. The second degree burns affect over 30 % of the total body surface area, causing severe redness, swelling, heat, and pain. The blood vessels may be ruptured and a third of these patients die of coagulation failure, shock, or renal failure. These burns are usually second degree, full thickness, and involve up to 30 %, 30 to 60 %, and 60 to 75 % of the total body surface area.","token_len":262,"entropy":[7.8734,0.389,3.7238,11.5022,1.7836,4.1912,3.1712,2.1375,1.3553,0.0615,3.0209,3.7312,5.2762,0.055,1.6777,11.0301,3.5488,0.85,7.6991,0.4815,9.9745,5.719,3.4979,5.7364,0.3804,4.8182,0.5708,6.6831,10.58,6.0248,6.9234,8.314,4.8748,4.9852,1.2859,3.4469,0.0433,3.0908,3.9217,5.1581,0.0301,5.7746,5.5529,3.4517,0.8858,1.2867,6.0954,0.6455,4.192,3.1944,0.7566,1.8596,0.1964,0.4144,0.2631,0.41,0.1292,0.4329,0.1169,3.9102,2.5906,2.5276,0.0348,5.6142,0.0058,0.74,0.6543,0.0317,0.0178,0.1232,1.6557,0.029,0.1423,0.0302,0.1311,2.9308,3.6461,5.0024,1.0815,1.0987,5.5847,5.247,0.3274,1.0484,1.7612,0.6251,8.8478,3.9892,1.2529,4.1881,4.6687,0.0695,0.8658,0.2385,3.1786,0.3985,0.2311,0.6269,3.2675,3.5218,0.0604,0.7632,6.819,0.0391,0.1317,0.9591,7.7688,0.4576,0.0107,3.5019,3.7622,1.759,0.9745,6.4863,0.1575,2.1169,5.6438,8.2241,0.4452,2.9391,5.0252,0.0598,5.6981,1.2758,8.6484,1.8514,0.6914,2.5709,6.5672,4.9328,6.2256,5.1463,5.3555,0.1498,1.8822,0.7357,4.5307,0.0033,6.1425,0.0187,5.4633,3.2373,5.443,0.3106,6.113,0.1012,0.233,7.6799,0.62,0.235,7.4104,4.3476,0.0005,4.3815,1.4166,0.0888,1.009,3.0102,0.8213,0.3123,0.0075,1.3457,11.59,5.9562,3.8564,0.0131,7.7216,0.7633,0.8945,2.0228,0.4875,1.0312,9.9263,0.7088,2.1817,3.2996,0.644,0.2586,3.7042,4.7424,3.5816,0.6094,0.3157,0.3054,0.3141,0.0167,0.0264,0.0005,2.7446,4.0963,3.8395,3.8109,0.0143,0.516,0.1616,0.131,6.4202,1.0705,0.4506,3.8345,0.3519,1.7145,6.0137,0.528,2.8494,1.1361,1.911,0.0009,1.8668,4.3883,4.6417,2.8622,5.8149,4.856,4.1318,4.227,8.1115,0.2287,0.7294,3.8223,2.3372,7.3536,0.3521,0.4228,5.7741,0.0655,0.2729,4.011,2.663,0.8814,2.2357,7.7956,0.6919,2.5039,8.1843,1.1032,0.3732,0.9326,5.4473,5.0365,0.0007,2.775,0.2224,6.7463,5.3295,1.1878,2.2741,0.4057,0.3408,1.496,1.4182,0.2263,4.0548,0.0301,1.6736,0.4003,0.6953,0.0865,0.0387,0.0049,0.6085]}

The free sodium remaining in the solution becomes available for use in biological processes and is therefore available for biological action on the cardiovascular system.\nThe remaining free sodium is then returned to the body via the kidneys, but it is not known exactly what proportion of the total body contents of sodium is returned each day, and it is not known the extent to which any body contents of sodium are used for ion exchange and other physiological functions.\nThe evidence indicates clearly that sodium taken from the diet is used mainly for the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance.\nA high sodium intake is thought to be one of the factors which contributes to the development of hypertension.\nHowever, it is difficult to understand why there is a correlation between an increase in the dietary intake of sodium and the elevation in blood pressure, whereas it is not possible to increase the blood pressure in a normal individual by eating more salt.","token_len":262,"entropy":[11.5497,3.8124,5.1494,1.5547,0.1385,6.6259,6.8082,4.1909,3.9366,2.3213,4.2849,0.5157,1.6264,2.9665,3.5577,5.3401,2.7468,3.8091,3.6132,8.3449,4.678,3.1021,5.0812,1.5819,2.8033,11.4181,7.7138,8.7626,7.1702,1.6122,1.401,0.3412,0.9394,3.9364,4.6304,4.112,0.4678,3.7243,3.0166,2.1772,5.3458,2.3317,4.9171,0.0238,4.5993,5.1653,1.5216,1.319,6.9418,3.5063,2.2881,5.7914,0.0022,0.5765,4.9752,1.2904,0.2541,0.0747,2.0506,0.7316,3.7439,4.6236,5.1061,0.315,2.0814,1.2517,0.3531,6.8841,3.5598,3.2216,9.8907,1.0897,8.5607,1.1916,1.1968,1.589,2.4603,6.123,2.7217,0.3458,1.705,0.8994,0.7323,1.5718,5.7924,1.3632,8.183,0.2231,0.943,4.4306,5.6638,5.4262,1.3041,2.2822,1.0264,7.705,1.5126,2.556,2.2158,3.63,4.6382,0.785,4.896,4.4974,4.592,1.3856,5.764,0.1281,0.3916,1.0441,1.6377,6.3628,2.8896,0.1946,0.8398,3.022,5.8285,0.1303,0.1637,1.0156,2.3098,1.0221,1.9133,2.0389,4.806,2.8572,0.5071,1.1979,5.2203,3.3288,1.9086,5.8664,0.3383,1.3523,3.0696,3.1035,6.7061,1.3583,1.4354,1.0918,3.1655,6.7015,0.4583,2.8847,1.9763,2.6026,0.399,1.5627,0.2773,5.3386,3.8868,0.6749,0.0012,4.2252,4.2521,4.0171,2.2215,0.7001,0.7815,3.5677,1.8672,9.066,7.3864,3.0461,3.733,2.7048,1.5326,0.3158,0.6458,1.557,7.6583,3.3885,8.7661,0.061,1.571,7.1241,1.9368,2.9171,1.2736,1.4726,3.7932,4.4568,0.7074,1.9476,5.0827,0.0276,6.8946,3.1375,1.9662,1.0126,0.6878,1.315,1.7455,3.2803,4.584,1.5667,1.835,1.8086,3.9617,0.0209,1.7017,4.5448,0.3039,0.0255,3.2846,2.7815,2.8654,0.0478,0.8215,2.6952,0.0849,1.7303,0.8688,1.383,4.6448,0.1961,2.4993,0.423,3.7745,0.021,4.0815,1.1652,3.5787,0.4232,1.5245,4.3376,0.1132,4.141,1.6237,0.0196,1.9105,4.2687,1.3208,0.0686,0.2687,0.3381,1.6719,6.1967,0.5169,0.9838,0.0252,2.6646,5.2671,3.4323,0.4924,1.9924,3.1,0.1591,6.9759,0.4178,4.3703,0.0649,2.4905,1.3108,3.2296,3.5538,3.2722,1.8124,2.3324,2.7545,0.3943]}

It was not developed specifically for the 8-bit model of the console but was ported down. The program for the Jaguar was then ported into TurboGrafx-16 (later 16-bit versions were released for other platforms). Some screenshots and information were posted to online forums. Atari's official fan site contains an update.\nThe game's title was changed a few times over the course of development. At first it was supposed to be Combat Unlimited; after Blackley said that he was going to call it F.U.2. Later on, Atari decided to keep the final title, as the \"II\" referred to the Game Boy Color game version.","token_len":263,"entropy":[7.9887,6.4042,0.2086,13.3171,0.532,7.0517,9.3916,8.0161,1.606,6.3718,3.9377,4.5554,8.3481,7.5342,0.2981,0.6016,1.0575,4.2212,0.3011,3.0816,0.4488,8.1744,14.3195,8.0514,5.4402,8.1212,11.2937,0.1435,8.5771,11.1909,1.8731,7.0935,5.2507,2.9516,3.0,6.9346,1.5457,2.3701,0.1122,0.1989,1.947,10.687,0.6656,0.1008,3.1349,0.0012,0.9646,1.7491,0.6395,2.8083,5.1639,4.5096,2.7723,6.9393,6.9432,5.6997,2.3705,2.9073,3.7437,4.6193,2.7276,2.6001,0.0015,3.7385,8.1988,1.1187,0.2935,1.789,3.8142,0.9808,0.0005,3.0182,2.0204,2.5756,0.2118,5.3819,5.4668,5.885,0.9605,4.0004,0.9992,1.423,2.9414,4.0031,6.4575,0.5943,0.9629,3.5757,2.3849,6.4376,7.4117,2.5538,3.1234,4.4957,6.1768,2.0796,3.1991,5.2303,5.0789,5.8544,6.1095,4.8553,7.1402,1.0549,1.4588,0.0247,1.2356,3.5058,3.0724,0.686,4.2447,5.8309,8.1839,0.0328,1.2436,3.2579,6.831,0.3497,0.3654,0.7215,5.0655,0.0158,6.5433,1.1885,3.691,2.8276,2.6841,0.6128,4.354,2.03,1.8422,0.768,3.6333,4.9293,4.9012,0.2143,1.0179,7.294,0.6405,0.0147,6.5905,1.5349,0.6896,5.647,2.4138,1.4499,5.8566,8.7735,5.8578,2.0086,5.4816,4.2728,1.2284,5.3797,1.3593,4.9751,1.8966,3.6294,6.4139,0.4687,0.0004,0.8693,0.0392,3.5829,3.1099,7.2097,0.5175,0.0151,6.2752,2.8571,1.4765,2.3362,3.4626,0.9332,1.1451,6.4158,6.4987,3.1929,3.2452,2.643,2.968,2.753,7.7061,0.935,1.524,6.1952,2.7219,4.387,7.2986,0.9124,6.1397,2.8429,5.5084,5.3759,0.5251,2.0661,2.6495,3.3384,3.3784,1.1682,6.7012,6.0055,0.9892,1.2828,3.322,0.2877,1.3109,0.0019,0.9874,1.0485,4.0846,3.0131,1.537,0.5719,4.974,0.0047,0.6053,8.2508,5.1989,5.0837,3.3126,7.0777,0.0466,4.5424,1.6959,0.8149,1.8525,2.0729,0.0913,5.6418,0.4831,5.3901,2.6241,1.2071,0.1397,5.8755,2.0574,5.1935,2.556,0.8674,4.4938,3.136,0.6596,4.5443,0.8079,6.6582,1.1488,1.929,4.5493,2.3785,5.2589,9.9728,0.3799,6.8191,0.0407,1.1061,5.5812,0.953,2.6519,4.3027,3.8974,1.2832]}

H\u00e4kkinen said that he was `` pleased `` to win the race and admitted that he was '' shocked '' to lose the title that went to the driver who had a one point advantage. He believes that his team did a `` good job and was able to catch up '' although he thinks he could have scored more points.\nThe drivers of Ferrari and McLaren were at the podium because they decided to pit, in the last laps. H\u00e4kkinen took his victory like an '' honor '' because it '' gives him more pride ''. He admitted that he is '' tired '' of the title but he also said that his decision to take a victory could prevent his team from missing the title. Schumacher could easily have won the race, as he lost the lead and in the race before that, he did lose several positions.\nH\u00e4kkinen has lost 3 championships recently, and this time it was a bad victory for him since the other drivers won races on his team.

This bird","text":"A `` painted vulture `` ( `` Sarcoramphus sacra `` or `` S. papa sacra `` ) is described in William Bartram's notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s. This bird is also known as Florida vulture, Florida vulture, painted vulture, painted kingbird, painted vulture, or vulture, American painted vulture, painted vulture, painted vulture, painted vulture, painted vulture, painted vulture. It is a large, grayish bird that has a reddish-brown upper plumage with large, prominent black bars on all four wingtips.\nIn the past, researchers concluded that the wingtips of the painted vulture were black because they studied many illustrations of this bird. However, this conclusion seems to have changed after the discovery of this bird by the photographer Bill Vickers in the United States. The painting in the vulture has a black wing tip, despite the fact that the vulture is gray. Researchers are still trying to explain the gray wing tip because this type of bird has a relatively common bird of prey. They have explained that the red color on the wings of the painted vulture is for camouflage. That is, the red colored wings help their vulture to blend into the background.","token_len":263,"entropy":[11.2297,18.4114,7.6553,2.8964,1.9349,3.1914,9.2573,7.0255,7.231,10.8292,11.3622,5.9578,11.5276,3.6997,3.4118,4.8168,0.8874,4.1743,4.7487,8.3768,3.3865,5.2103,0.1199,0.6337,1.0604,2.2464,4.7946,0.2243,12.372,7.3168,3.723,0.8905,8.6054,2.9082,4.3555,5.0519,1.7151,6.031,3.7347,0.6873,4.4162,2.7741,0.3475,1.3011,3.9833,4.5586,1.2773,4.0094,1.3835,0.2252,9.3873,3.1516,0.3921,1.5986,4.3555,0.4612,0.5082,1.162,9.2287,0.1844,0.0764,0.5065,3.0824,8.9523,5.0747,0.5051,1.4141,1.6267,0.0376,0.5708,3.012,4.4105,0.307,2.4094,7.3865,5.2389,0.2998,0.063,0.9001,2.7946,0.8485,0.0341,0.3811,1.5012,0.8271,0.0767,0.3236,1.2966,0.5518,0.0725,0.2786,1.0231,0.3922,0.0342,0.233,0.7726,0.258,0.0154,2.9274,2.6044,0.6986,1.8627,2.856,1.1069,4.426,2.054,3.3938,2.3317,1.9189,1.208,3.9759,0.0044,1.4867,0.3936,5.0008,5.5248,0.0001,2.4164,4.2104,1.7397,5.2717,3.1487,5.97,1.7971,5.7736,1.7963,5.1836,3.2369,0.562,4.5828,6.7562,1.7266,5.8893,1.1269,8.3003,8.7961,0.0821,1.4266,4.7799,2.507,0.6808,2.2943,2.3118,0.0873,0.4698,1.0895,5.5548,3.3954,1.4352,9.8476,6.2823,7.9097,0.5828,3.5927,0.6481,1.3754,1.9529,0.0223,2.7304,3.7812,5.8116,0.3514,0.3588,2.863,3.1372,1.0323,3.201,0.1013,3.4505,0.9625,1.1289,3.0982,5.4876,5.8172,5.6084,3.1543,1.0545,2.435,5.0256,0.0623,1.2329,2.3089,4.1726,4.9035,1.8118,4.9237,0.1109,3.4725,1.8224,2.6805,4.0308,3.4594,1.4843,7.537,0.857,0.3674,0.037,0.9522,2.3028,0.0756,1.0571,5.4167,0.9467,7.5165,3.8616,2.0507,1.8187,0.0072,4.0096,1.5832,6.1936,3.2303,0.7807,4.4163,3.0764,5.8449,0.0656,0.8835,1.5897,1.822,5.2492,5.1521,5.6625,3.2704,1.5502,1.4162,4.6496,1.9815,7.9408,0.6587,0.8535,4.3945,2.3499,3.9671,0.216,2.579,1.1945,0.9756,0.4211,0.0377,0.1249,1.0537,6.5481,3.5367,1.929,5.7121,1.2186,0.9878,0.9688,2.0503,3.851,2.381,5.2848,6.3057,4.3494,0.5512,1.5144,4.9697,1.6576,0.3882,2.6806,1.1621]}

However","text":"In 2009, the serial embarked on two lesbian storylines, one of which involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric ( Sophie < unk > ) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, in, the series decided to abandon the gay theme, at which point the series began to focus more on lesbian couples that were not dating yet. After several attempts, the writers found a solution to the problem of Nicole, and the character is currently a lesbian.\nAlthough the show has been criticized for its inability to address lesbian storylines, the show does, as a whole, promote a healthy image as a gay-friendly, safe space on network television. The show does an excellent, safe job at being about a contemporary lesbian romance, which is rare in this day and age, and is definitely considered more inclusive of diverse sexual identities and lifestyles, and the characters are much nicer than their network rivals.\nThe show has received glowing critiques from the LGBT community, and this has sparked a controversy in regards to whether or not viewers view it with biases due to its being broadcast by a network that claims to be LGBT-friendly. The controversy has resulted in many people pointing out the flaws and the stereotypes that are present in this series, and many people agreeing that although the show is great for young viewers, it lacks diversity for older and experienced viewers.","token_len":268,"entropy":[8.4153,0.191,1.6828,11.066,14.4466,0.11,5.0103,11.7141,7.4974,1.4264,1.9152,2.202,0.4112,2.2265,7.856,4.6671,4.0182,3.9317,10.3413,1.0698,10.5654,7.4384,3.3351,11.9473,13.2057,10.2391,5.4644,6.2857,2.4553,6.1986,2.4906,2.0266,3.2611,5.0106,6.4187,4.2428,3.9452,0.0448,3.1013,9.5419,1.5301,2.2779,5.6981,0.2618,6.4382,0.6967,4.9532,3.8133,2.0663,5.8013,2.5378,0.106,1.8098,1.7574,3.9604,0.7668,2.8463,1.5872,0.091,4.7079,4.2115,5.5281,1.4594,2.7656,6.4244,6.6234,0.4086,4.6368,4.3095,3.4454,1.1824,0.8629,5.2595,4.0075,1.309,2.5067,1.938,0.5859,0.9613,2.9521,6.7237,3.2493,1.5679,2.7219,4.2625,3.7081,5.1814,3.3454,1.6716,0.9586,1.1217,11.1788,1.2473,2.4627,1.7756,1.8175,2.9272,0.4062,1.2269,6.7285,0.0188,3.6173,3.0567,4.2855,0.4777,1.6387,1.2549,3.5664,5.5977,3.2569,2.1041,1.8652,0.0222,5.7342,2.242,2.1231,5.8054,5.2244,0.5037,3.0444,2.0271,0.9277,3.7025,4.8265,2.7213,5.1384,5.1639,0.4394,0.2057,2.2359,0.9553,3.7614,5.9227,0.5541,9.0714,5.1432,1.2058,2.442,4.2121,3.5782,2.4213,10.0822,1.3867,3.5144,1.1847,2.76,0.9064,6.4869,0.9765,3.4235,2.4711,0.0201,0.0005,1.6845,1.2933,2.452,4.547,5.6283,4.288,4.4518,1.4583,5.4194,4.4151,2.2303,2.4519,2.5872,3.1526,2.6289,4.1901,3.8249,1.2598,4.7527,5.8923,1.4627,2.4105,9.3515,6.1799,0.3063,1.0934,2.2383,1.1719,1.7725,3.6549,6.3722,9.0974,0.7693,2.8609,1.378,0.111,0.827,1.3343,4.7523,2.1313,5.4182,1.3157,5.1036,2.3867,5.08,0.012,3.6682,0.6854,0.0014,6.4,7.0126,1.8434,3.9905,9.1461,5.9555,0.0172,0.9934,6.0158,5.9472,3.6901,2.3605,0.9016,1.3797,6.0833,0.3722,0.594,4.1866,1.2147,0.0747,0.4335,2.1224,4.4595,1.4587,3.2696,0.0394,3.0898,2.4423,5.4922,0.1724,2.1045,3.9908,2.9389,3.5843,5.882,1.516,2.1831,2.8122,0.4754,2.5701,3.0167,0.5574,0.8543,3.4715,1.9315,6.9092,0.5476,6.0989,0.9521,0.5811,0.9551,5.2728,2.4768,4.8324,1.9909,0.2213,0.6346,4.469,4.1649,4.3894,1.5888,4.3605,6.7069,0.4056,0.3476]}

The Six Nations started out as a rivalry between France and England as the two nations competed in intercontinental tournaments and the resulting rugby league matches. The rivalry had an additional significance for England, as they played France for a place in the Tournoi des Cinq Nations and the winner was allowed to qualify for the final Tournoi match against Italy. The tournament was known informally as the \" Grand Slam \".\nAfter the Second World War, the nations joined together and played each other on a professional basis. The First World War produced new and strong national identities and by the end of the 20th century, a new form of European football emerged, leading to a revival of the old Six Nations tournament.\nIt was widely perceived that since the early days of the French occupation in 1215 that England's rugby union and rugby league have been rivals and had long been seen as rivals in rugby.\nHistorically however, the competition has had two significant rivalrys: between the English of the English Confederation (and the North) and the French of the Confederation (and the South), and between the English and Scots of the Confederations. These rivalries have often been exploited by commercial marketing.","token_len":269,"entropy":[12.242,0.0503,7.6029,1.2305,0.9011,7.3948,0.0405,2.7541,1.8934,2.4564,1.6579,2.4434,5.564,3.9677,2.5461,4.1328,1.177,11.1512,1.3566,0.1362,3.279,0.0646,1.9504,0.1903,2.3318,0.4676,3.4095,0.9223,0.139,2.0706,2.8475,0.0017,8.4821,4.4043,0.9873,0.5617,6.9196,0.5059,2.9861,0.2353,1.1472,4.9351,1.9004,1.1257,1.4065,2.0054,1.0225,8.1606,1.5372,1.953,3.4246,2.4022,6.4387,5.3314,2.1164,4.2824,2.1766,1.8489,4.2314,4.5235,2.8793,7.3345,3.9592,2.0153,2.6601,1.852,1.0856,2.3101,2.4711,5.8943,3.4842,2.6045,8.2223,0.1611,0.1578,6.8318,5.6103,3.3394,8.9524,6.8018,3.9037,3.2452,7.3176,2.6373,2.4699,6.5012,2.2941,6.4923,0.1285,6.2332,0.3395,0.3057,4.1855,6.1596,0.0718,0.0424,6.2249,2.399,2.6462,0.7364,1.8266,3.7666,1.3279,4.0767,8.44,0.0177,0.0478,0.3781,2.9439,9.233,2.6485,1.4725,2.0182,7.4694,0.8927,5.2873,0.161,0.0075,0.3918,1.2451,5.9207,4.8813,3.6623,2.7193,2.1479,3.9353,0.0093,3.8227,1.4745,5.8581,1.1688,0.9593,1.5585,5.9532,0.3216,0.0101,5.1722,6.0247,3.3413,6.5171,4.472,3.3176,2.0911,6.8777,1.1365,1.9075,0.0122,0.7358,3.4901,0.0457,0.1827,0.5622,3.9579,1.7321,3.9294,0.0291,4.7404,2.1086,2.7845,1.8814,7.043,0.1831,1.8558,3.9437,0.2359,1.0413,4.7495,6.956,0.0007,5.1772,0.7572,1.4532,4.7494,0.8488,6.027,4.6908,0.522,6.8939,0.7433,4.2583,3.6605,0.092,0.9714,5.5528,6.7005,2.6964,6.7432,4.162,1.9141,3.5251,2.3495,3.006,4.049,3.847,2.0769,0.5617,6.5339,1.4702,7.8369,2.4311,4.8208,4.3996,1.4319,4.4113,0.1109,1.2834,2.1482,3.4267,2.2739,2.988,5.9667,1.202,5.827,0.0733,1.1117,4.6248,1.7424,3.8334,3.0806,4.2736,6.266,15.3814,1.7372,6.158,1.1097,3.4727,5.7474,0.9596,5.0461,7.2151,2.5326,5.8078,1.5686,5.983,3.9959,0.0597,0.4166,1.4044,0.73,0.3472,2.2056,0.7931,0.7773,0.542,0.8633,3.2349,2.4573,0.2007,0.3754,1.6498,1.7223,4.6372,0.5323,0.2702,7.1242,0.3334,1.4574,4.3019,1.4316,0.0596,0.86,3.0374,1.0713,6.6015,0.925,7.099,8.6246,3.1929]}

Based in Mogadishu, it constituted the executive branch of government. The Federal Government had lost its legitimacy after the collapse of the Transitional Federal Parliament in 2005, despite the appointment of several TFG prime ministers.\nIn 2011, the parliament was re-formed but the TFG collapsed after a failed coup attempt by Mohamed Hussein Aidid, in which thousands of civilians died [1]. Mohamed Hussein Aidid was captured by the government forces and was charged with treason and terrorism. He was sentenced to death and hanged in July 2012 [2].\nIn January 2015, parliament voted to disestablish the TFG and support the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia.\nIn January 2016, a conference held in the Somalian capital for the reconciliation of political powers was broken up by a gunfire. The main conflict areas were in Mogadishu (Banaadir, Barawe, Bulaay, Chogod, Kismayo, and Shabelle), the regions of Mandera and Lower Shabelle, and parts of Lower and Middle and Western Subaale.

The company and its subsidiaries operate in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\nThere are now over 6 million Americans using a health insurance program through the Affordable Care Act. The National Health insurance system has become a major health care delivery system in the United States. More people are seeking health care out of necessity as a way to reduce their financial health risks.\nThe federal government has a primary role in establishing health care policy. When we look at health insurance, we look at health care policy, which are determined by our federal government. Different states have different regulations, but in general, a lot of state laws have a similar structure to the federal regulations.\nMany patients are forced to pay out of pocket for what are considered basic health care services for their family members. While a doctor may offer free services to a specific patient, patients are encouraged to have these services covered by their insurance provider. That way, the health insurance company only costs them a small percentage for the services performed by the health care providers.\nHealth insurance services cover everything from preventive medical services like checking your cholesterol, to more inpatient services. There are both private and public health insurance companies providing health insurance.","token_len":270,"entropy":[7.4418,7.1701,2.639,1.6161,5.4935,0.0752,0.3011,1.3868,8.7459,0.1322,0.1907,0.1365,0.185,1.5439,0.0061,0.8865,2.2629,5.3855,0.1744,8.3805,0.0635,0.0001,2.1014,2.0278,0.543,5.7317,0.6307,1.9863,3.5834,2.8651,4.8621,0.6611,3.6267,0.0005,0.0005,0.0088,0.0318,1.3829,3.291,0.0251,0.0565,0.0021,0.3297,0.6383,0.0005,1.5839,2.6799,0.3515,0.9844,16.5065,0.5932,4.4486,2.9242,3.9347,1.5942,2.6513,5.4199,4.2352,4.3551,0.2264,2.4627,3.9852,0.9594,1.8111,0.0168,0.0006,0.7971,2.046,5.5812,1.2781,7.9488,4.1162,2.5374,2.9844,1.3483,2.2157,4.8996,0.5078,4.7181,0.3895,1.6957,0.5202,0.3619,0.0015,0.5905,4.5704,4.123,1.1433,4.7818,1.691,1.5359,5.6162,0.0319,5.2863,4.7647,1.8972,2.1955,0.2498,3.3873,0.532,4.3688,4.9863,2.1569,0.8142,0.9685,2.3161,4.1457,0.3031,1.8772,3.264,6.1762,2.3274,0.1426,4.9197,1.495,1.6462,3.823,1.5439,5.3106,4.5677,4.1398,0.2414,2.2231,1.5753,1.3777,0.9191,2.4826,0.1266,3.338,0.8494,2.6406,2.5057,2.4436,5.4822,6.3322,0.1775,3.5574,3.5606,0.5541,0.62,8.6519,1.5876,1.4158,0.0998,4.4128,2.1955,2.0556,3.2469,0.9909,0.5884,3.8546,3.0071,0.1104,3.7407,1.5173,2.892,2.5756,3.8069,2.9031,1.8623,1.3414,0.4111,3.7394,0.4064,1.2022,4.3069,6.7131,2.0128,4.5478,0.2621,1.5099,3.224,0.279,0.0977,0.7841,5.252,4.3476,3.4071,4.85,1.1468,0.3522,1.1337,4.5717,1.2199,1.9465,0.8346,0.4034,4.9181,3.5408,5.0174,1.5677,4.8761,3.5909,4.2345,1.3653,1.5486,4.5429,1.3096,0.4076,4.3592,1.696,4.7655,0.0523,3.653,4.3654,0.24,2.9868,0.6359,1.2306,1.1503,3.5465,0.3871,5.0273,3.5164,0.3433,2.0642,3.9291,1.5183,2.2021,6.1539,3.6597,3.05,1.7666,1.6752,1.8484,6.1132,1.2056,1.7937,6.2252,1.6865,0.6056,3.1564,0.5808,3.4117,0.5719,0.5933,3.2796,0.7181,5.6293,5.4316,4.3701,0.2164,3.0852,4.9279,1.854,3.4044,5.64,2.2604,2.7138,1.8684,1.3925,5.7211,6.6467,3.7197,2.1634,4.5657,3.705,0.3704,7.6086,2.4385,0.1882,0.3425,0.8935,0.5493,2.1115,3.6438,1.5648,1.2712,1.9397]}

One of these developments was the iron framed building. Traditional buildings supported their internal floors through timber beams. The new systems allowed buildings to become slenderer to take space where it would have previously been filled. These steel framed buildings were first built at New York City\u2019s Manhattan Island\u2019s Warehouse Area.\nAround 1870, several large residential buildings were built in the Warehouse area. One of these buildings was the Union Terminal or New York Railroad Building. It is one of the oldest buildings in New York City\u2019s World Heritage Area. It is the headquarters of the Department of Energy. It is a structure which is visible on the World Atlas of Architecture.\nOne of the best examples of the steel framed building is the Empire State Building. The first part of these constructions was installed in 1932, and the completed structure opened at the beginning of 1933. It is considered the tallest skyscraper in the world.

Anderson's own beliefs in the power of spirituality, combined with his experience in the movie The Da Vinci Code and the success of the novels The Four Traits and The Three Laws, gave Anderson a feeling to create a religion.\nThe story of the film is similar to the plot that Andrew Hussie based on the novel: the main character is an Italian scholar and cryptographer. He studies secret manuscripts of great philosophers, historians and scientists who are associated with many mysteries, such as the Bible, the book of Revelation or the Koran. There is a legend of a hidden island on which all these manuscripts are located. On the island there is a crypt in an underground tunnel. In this crypt are located the manuscripts that are linked to the legend about Da Vinci.\nIn the film, Anderson chose to use the main character as a central figure and take the story from there. The character of a scholar, with its own knowledge, will lead to the further development of the plot. The director of the film wanted to give the viewer the impression that the character is different from the rest of the people. The character will be the focus of all the other characters, and there will be only a small detail in the storyline.","token_len":273,"entropy":[10.9948,2.5591,0.5932,6.8219,2.3553,0.8754,2.6246,3.2584,14.9471,7.8221,4.5238,12.6253,1.1982,8.7209,6.9972,7.5418,0.9637,4.0112,1.0335,1.9309,1.5281,3.4283,3.0521,2.4581,0.4087,2.3596,2.8648,3.4328,6.6534,9.2509,3.3699,1.3357,5.8868,0.1969,7.6534,2.738,5.4237,0.0026,1.0971,3.6768,2.0615,1.7269,5.82,3.254,8.5093,0.0231,0.0001,0.0007,2.7416,1.902,5.618,0.0636,1.9704,8.5292,2.1055,6.982,9.0579,0.1303,2.3472,1.0205,4.9931,4.7141,1.8589,3.4454,3.733,1.4935,5.6783,4.2079,3.9362,0.9213,6.8595,2.1883,1.256,9.0095,4.3013,1.9343,1.5211,4.4696,2.4759,4.6873,0.3921,1.1755,4.0423,4.5788,8.4275,4.4632,0.0062,7.6509,1.2486,2.6885,2.3978,5.4313,2.0845,3.3929,0.7001,1.1202,2.3615,5.792,7.1902,2.4301,10.2218,0.581,2.5748,1.6487,6.1877,7.0483,5.8976,2.2791,6.3988,3.2115,1.5173,6.2479,0.664,3.0512,3.2228,2.298,5.224,0.0247,5.4867,6.1446,1.8724,1.9539,0.0022,0.7565,6.2977,0.704,1.2101,6.8561,0.0264,1.597,4.3875,0.515,3.77,0.1662,5.0445,1.1857,0.9596,6.5543,2.4008,1.0515,6.0976,5.3716,3.8964,2.3213,4.9086,3.3401,5.7879,0.9619,1.9303,0.9039,4.6966,1.1471,0.1053,2.8606,0.5629,0.3526,5.6264,3.285,3.8029,3.3843,4.0778,1.3366,3.2756,2.5158,0.6932,2.9721,6.6695,1.7883,3.273,2.6025,1.7381,5.2186,0.4432,0.7274,5.0463,4.9972,10.7904,0.002,0.0001,1.4196,1.7899,2.7626,1.0287,1.6731,0.5889,1.7977,7.4091,0.7688,2.5726,1.2359,6.7074,0.4556,1.5863,0.6153,4.9559,0.6059,2.3999,5.0788,1.661,2.8033,2.768,1.3423,0.2626,1.7464,3.2915,1.6404,4.9664,4.5546,2.2346,4.9998,5.1749,4.1221,4.4168,1.8772,4.7021,3.2365,1.7114,1.6649,7.3647,1.5188,0.0611,1.004,4.6335,0.8741,1.7645,5.0681,2.6887,0.4059,0.4463,3.8697,0.3782,3.3542,0.9938,2.6485,1.9369,2.5728,0.2575,1.0867,2.8513,1.4813,6.058,0.2863,0.7852,3.1183,0.2813,0.1049,3.0496,2.0577,1.9941,2.4444,3.6278,1.6672,3.238,4.5068,0.1589,5.2695,0.5732,4.693,0.9225,1.7581,1.7646,4.5584,0.6913,0.1197,5.424,2.6263,2.088,5.6133,2.0451,0.4043,5.3766,1.4084]}

The focus of the Convention on Cultural Property has been on the protection of historical works, but the Convention also aims at the protection of all those works of cultural heritage which cannot be considered \"works of art\" but can be considered, in the context of their use and their function, to express or communicate intellectual or artistic ideas. The Convention, in the same spirit as the Convention on Ways and Means of Promoting la Francophonie, aims at providing for the protection of the local, regional and community expressions, and the cultural heritage of national and ethnic minorities.","token_len":273,"entropy":[1.9437,8.0224,3.1861,0.0123,7.2847,1.0279,0.3875,1.7131,0.3074,9.6621,8.6376,2.7073,1.502,1.1684,4.2436,4.9039,2.5075,0.0289,1.8256,8.6986,0.8114,8.7504,1.75,1.4986,2.4224,0.0008,5.4971,4.2269,9.8082,1.6921,0.0742,0.0423,2.1795,3.8289,2.8448,2.5345,2.602,0.1328,5.229,0.0522,3.564,6.3428,4.9266,3.1611,1.5709,0.1335,0.4955,2.3939,0.8,12.3285,3.6387,1.7025,3.6418,1.8287,7.8049,5.7018,3.1713,5.6278,2.2287,4.7781,0.0136,0.7043,1.7146,2.0376,3.3959,0.0577,0.0024,3.5426,3.4724,3.9468,0.1181,0.3609,0.4429,8.2536,6.217,1.7418,3.6241,3.0156,3.8244,2.1766,1.2983,3.9029,1.4837,2.8995,4.0809,0.2539,0.9184,8.8117,7.7276,1.616,1.0275,9.9958,1.7031,0.0002,5.8463,0.0027,2.2955,8.7494,3.4637,7.068,0.0046,1.3751,3.3116,0.1657,1.5391,0.9957,1.4381,5.1091,1.2973,0.0176,0.8236,3.3737,0.0326,3.5227,0.2039,3.5611,0.264,0.8236,3.0696,1.9734,4.4671,1.1055,0.014,3.7001,7.9699,1.528,6.6908,3.3976,0.3023,1.6002,8.7489,1.3463,5.1334,0.0196,2.5074,5.9553,2.4243,2.9877,1.0837,4.1539,5.308,1.3099,3.7691,0.8301,0.9877,7.9412,0.114,6.644,2.7358,1.4217,0.8786,7.6115,3.3021,0.0637,2.5258,0.0004,4.5824,1.2147,1.2718,0.7653,3.2459,6.2804,0.586,1.3026,5.3495,0.5483,1.7488,1.4764,3.5941,0.3621,0.8599,1.213,0.6427,0.2417,3.5473,4.5479,1.3858,3.6619,2.2403,1.629,1.1616,4.323,0.7561,1.8384,0.8452,0.2099,4.936,4.2963,2.0601,3.6403,1.9944,0.9244,0.8125,5.7003,0.0986,4.8061,2.7363,6.4384,0.4158,1.8053,1.4221,3.8524,3.7736,0.4946,1.1278,4.3315,1.6782,1.5011,2.8405,0.0084,2.3394,3.9978,1.9538,4.0484,6.194,0.3532,1.609,6.2484,1.7764,4.801,6.3477,1.9126,1.4441,2.4006,1.1586,2.6508,0.6031,3.5899,2.2747,3.5624,3.6404,2.104,1.5596,0.3873,1.4257,0.191,10.4585,1.6505,0.0094,1.6689,8.2104,0.0077,13.305,4.5777,0.1365,0.0016,0.7243,3.4327,0.3672,5.2671,1.4672,0.5147,0.9101,0.2716,2.0369,7.5272,2.9306,1.9225,0.633,7.9621,9.3923,3.4442,1.9032,2.1818,4.2205,2.0855,0.7745,5.8089,1.2614,2.3404,1.6777,0.7954]}

Under the Crusaders, Haifa was one of the first cities of Judaism to adopt the Christian liturgy, receiving the Bishop of Cyprus, as well as the title of metropolitan, in 1106.\nIn 1292, the Ottomans under the Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pach\u00e1 reconquered Haifa. In the 16th century, two new harbors were built, one being the Golden Horn, and the second the White Horn, but in the 17th century, the Ottomans were defeated by the Crusaders who held their territory from the Portuguese, Dutch and Spanish until 1948. The Ottoman governor, who was supported by the population, attempted to defend Haifa, but was forced to retreat to Jaffa in 1647.\nAfter several years of occupations by British forces, France, and Italy, and a short period ( 1948\u20131966 ) as a part of the British Mandate of Palestine, Haifa was annexed to Israel in 1950. The city is known worldwide because it is a major fishing port and for its international airport, an important hub for Israeli commercial and tourist flights. The Haifa International Music Festival is a famous international event.","token_len":274,"entropy":[8.0378,1.1249,9.2304,2.8854,11.0666,5.3069,3.7079,4.336,1.9027,4.3937,9.8017,4.2004,2.2443,5.8262,2.5168,10.6319,0.0928,0.8479,1.6369,7.1939,0.0828,2.6253,4.3401,5.2955,6.5301,2.7828,4.8091,1.128,2.2579,7.0729,4.6465,2.8709,3.6803,8.0734,1.0462,0.6371,9.6275,0.58,7.0683,0.9448,5.7854,0.0958,1.0049,2.158,0.0006,1.4061,4.8236,0.0215,0.3841,2.1779,1.9562,2.8156,6.1102,0.8204,4.6793,1.2232,3.4652,5.9462,0.4673,1.5798,7.2988,1.5032,9.8973,0.7062,9.5729,2.3568,4.1354,1.2213,0.0029,0.8377,5.4822,0.2514,8.1418,2.6999,2.1077,6.8313,1.7925,0.502,1.4367,6.283,3.6542,5.1349,0.4704,1.1894,6.4022,0.0052,0.0002,6.6706,1.9342,7.5437,1.3617,0.0045,7.8304,6.889,5.1632,7.4305,10.1978,0.7113,0.0006,0.8188,0.0006,2.3754,2.5051,2.4254,5.2873,0.3703,0.1053,0.2754,5.7187,3.7471,8.0464,0.0526,0.8348,0.8588,2.141,1.559,5.9644,1.9463,6.4387,3.8909,1.6315,2.0847,0.386,3.4737,1.4005,5.6827,2.882,0.9279,4.1801,3.1553,1.2934,1.6216,0.0589,0.1029,0.9585,0.983,1.5232,0.0028,0.0003,2.3446,3.4135,1.0831,0.4733,3.0874,0.05,4.2385,5.275,2.9818,2.3007,4.2947,1.7457,8.5311,2.9361,6.6123,0.9399,3.4263,6.2934,7.9494,0.3782,1.8758,2.9626,7.8491,1.8063,5.2118,1.4449,6.1615,0.0797,0.9534,7.6835,1.2249,5.2774,0.0896,5.6174,1.0671,0.0005,1.9037,0.3986,1.0195,3.6479,0.1943,1.7245,2.0625,6.0927,0.6747,0.1063,2.8598,3.4577,4.6367,0.5949,1.2232,3.4231,4.8982,0.9507,0.4124,9.8071,1.671,6.1198,1.5418,0.466,7.8248,2.6804,2.2115,3.0068,0.3842,3.5807,2.6158,4.2744,1.4198,7.9344,11.9544,2.7182,7.005,1.0638,5.1508,1.3164,3.2703,0.0078,0.5084,3.039,3.5816,0.008,1.8221,1.623,0.3879,1.8098,0.0049,0.4861,3.2819,1.003,3.0363,0.6774,5.4684,0.5839,1.8507,2.9615,2.3253,3.7142,5.3771,5.6256,2.0253,0.9004,3.0182,3.015,7.1994,0.8191,1.3733,5.5301,2.9391,8.0958,6.8056,1.4148,5.2523,1.203,3.3657,0.4792,4.91,3.6792,2.0578,4.2153,3.1868,0.5699,2.1185,4.4185,0.0009,3.7443,13.2913,0.8023,1.4877,3.6819,6.0831,3.33,1.9103,2.3643]}

At the Spanish approach, the inhabitants remained enclosed in the city walls and fought bravely. But in 1526 the Spaniard finally captured Mixco Viejo. The capital, with some 50,000 inhabitants, was completely destroyed. It was not until 1561 when the Spanish conqueror Francisco de Alvarado was in charge that the last traces of this ancient civilisation were completely destroyed.\nHowever the inhabitants, who had been driven into the countryside, had taken shelter in abandoned ruins and built up one of the most impressive city of the ancient times. It is known today as the ancient ruins of Sacapulas and is only about 3 kilometers from the Mixco Viejo.\nThe ruins, which are very well preserved, were built between 1200 and 1500 and consist of huge blocks of stone and stone masonry walls. Above the city buildings, a city ceiling that was believed to shelter the nuns in times of heavy rain.\nAlong these ancient ruins are to be found great carved representations of mythical characters.\nThe ruins are part of a UNESCO world heritage site - although they are rather under-explored. Here you can learn more about the ancient civilisations that lived between AD 500 and 2500.","token_len":274,"entropy":[7.7691,4.8859,12.9456,2.0213,3.0913,2.4003,0.0144,5.2419,1.3351,5.5828,7.2161,1.0626,6.2441,12.5485,6.0237,10.3515,0.4066,3.7674,15.3313,12.47,5.2949,5.4933,0.0236,4.5553,2.5302,1.9216,0.2748,1.4078,7.3502,5.8824,7.6173,6.0822,3.9851,4.3788,0.7756,9.0368,8.8221,0.7228,1.4349,5.3028,7.2176,8.4288,1.1598,2.5175,3.0874,1.2689,2.0339,5.7457,5.1596,0.0063,1.392,3.7069,2.7161,1.0437,2.3684,1.9758,2.8535,3.4406,6.0457,3.739,5.2001,0.0102,1.1793,0.0005,1.9475,1.8255,4.5711,3.1425,3.7142,5.6059,3.9528,0.2122,0.0029,0.1469,0.1505,0.6365,4.7081,1.1707,1.5463,3.644,0.6295,3.3365,0.32,1.1393,6.4254,2.9734,1.0354,2.4428,4.9031,0.2572,4.3891,1.5481,1.7259,0.3066,0.0064,3.4582,4.8297,3.3766,3.6131,0.712,6.4271,4.5067,0.0178,4.499,3.9316,4.3114,0.8363,6.2449,2.1923,0.3008,1.038,8.165,3.7141,3.9994,4.4474,1.5446,1.588,1.3786,4.8282,3.6445,1.841,4.4495,1.5047,3.0644,4.7286,3.8944,0.5301,7.2663,4.3292,2.0062,3.8902,4.0296,6.897,0.2147,0.1448,1.0467,3.4921,5.0565,4.2731,0.9863,4.3974,5.2834,0.2473,3.079,1.7179,3.6173,2.9498,0.7835,1.3485,6.8329,5.1196,0.1244,10.1112,6.4516,9.5384,2.9206,4.3193,5.1365,3.2593,4.0343,2.6837,1.3432,0.5937,10.1527,0.0313,0.3415,0.0023,1.2454,1.2749,1.481,2.7887,3.8821,1.3163,1.4717,4.6531,2.6308,0.3224,0.609,1.9296,1.553,4.3919,5.7539,0.3999,1.4818,4.0955,5.0008,0.1654,5.8557,4.9927,0.266,1.1276,1.7592,2.5668,3.6237,0.1605,5.9873,1.1622,6.5004,1.1195,4.1177,5.5563,1.3718,2.7738,5.5682,7.8524,5.7841,1.5013,7.2651,0.0225,7.9675,0.9026,11.2045,3.9884,7.9896,0.1367,6.0378,1.5537,3.7367,1.8608,6.6594,4.2839,4.451,1.0407,2.5565,7.9919,0.5411,0.1872,5.7794,8.5509,6.6662,0.1365,6.9789,3.7547,1.9198,2.7027,1.443,3.6134,1.5674,5.7661,0.0081,1.2476,4.5691,3.2685,0.0282,0.1777,5.7879,6.9359,1.9196,0.6933,6.7707,5.0511,1.5205,3.2887,0.0213,0.534,4.8238,3.0501,0.7122,3.8246,0.8686,0.0658,0.5645,2.9775,7.0713,0.0444,2.5569,3.3092,5.2368,6.8063,3.6814,0.2415,6.0718,0.8674]}

It contained a few errors in my illustrations and some references to publications from more than 20 years before. The errors in particular were about the structure of DNA and protein, two basic subjects on which my lecture emphasised that Herg\u00e9, an excellent illustrator, did not have access to a biochemistry textbook for the information on which he drew his pictures.\nIt was therefore a real pleasure to receive this invitation to meet my old students in Cambridge, to give them the opportunity to read a new picture of the book they helped to make famous, and to discover, as they were doing, what new research has been published recently.","token_len":275,"entropy":[7.7293,6.4183,0.9567,6.6488,1.8447,7.9426,2.1903,4.4005,4.1234,3.2933,0.9079,11.6823,2.7178,18.0496,4.9493,0.0039,0.1625,7.022,1.9097,4.8085,0.1768,4.7975,8.8568,0.3985,11.0472,8.0364,1.8876,3.2446,2.1996,0.005,0.0039,12.7853,2.3251,4.8934,2.1262,1.2251,8.1129,5.1146,0.9132,0.0085,0.0102,2.5914,10.8544,0.5706,0.2125,6.7373,0.0021,0.8501,4.887,2.9481,2.1737,7.609,5.9841,0.7542,3.2148,7.8156,0.5623,4.2018,1.5294,4.5989,1.7816,2.0208,0.0036,0.0016,1.8042,7.9244,1.9676,1.2101,1.4229,0.701,6.5905,0.0123,5.3664,5.2137,1.8626,6.5651,0.1882,0.0521,0.2442,0.001,0.6784,4.7042,0.0602,4.3353,5.5939,0.1764,1.7184,3.9852,0.2394,0.1976,2.2243,5.2335,2.4995,1.0994,5.822,1.79,1.489,3.8901,3.6129,3.4751,5.165,5.2051,1.5211,1.0071,8.2584,5.1794,1.1916,4.5768,4.6836,3.8572,1.347,0.785,0.9014,5.4926,3.5479,0.0961,3.2522,3.3818,10.8483,2.2511,1.7404,1.3973,5.7516,6.6302,4.2846,0.0129,0.0023,2.1759,10.4525,5.911,1.0331,1.5648,1.9073,5.0669,0.4077,1.4996,1.0731,3.1798,6.5964,2.914,5.6948,0.6943,5.03,6.4799,0.0978,2.2805,6.5784,1.6207,2.2134,3.2534,1.0074,4.757,6.2882,2.4671,4.663,8.817,2.0425,3.1833,4.8294,0.4345,7.9893,3.1765,6.5142,1.3648,2.8906,0.1939,2.3837,0.7177,2.2869,6.5306,2.9479,7.704,1.0824,6.2468,1.1774,6.6519,0.1554,7.9697,1.8911,5.8167,2.3965,7.5341,4.6733,6.8429,4.667,0.0711,4.841,6.1245,8.5529,0.1166,3.0136,12.3203,7.8779,1.2274,3.7442,4.0386,5.4181,5.7506,0.001,0.39,3.7524,0.6712,2.1525,3.7876,0.2599,2.7298,8.2737,2.1752,0.2686,4.0293,1.9949,8.6836,2.5032,3.2309,1.1952,3.2948,1.9276,4.6255,0.2826,1.7091,3.727,1.0988,5.5046,2.9385,5.8253,2.9735,0.2172,4.5242,2.2,5.9336,1.2974,3.9058,3.8314,5.081,6.3738,2.9939,2.7464,1.6408,3.176,4.4429,1.0688,2.3226,0.9974,0.039,2.6186,2.9369,2.9983,6.2216,0.9432,2.1787,4.9897,4.1471,7.2641,1.3315,2.779,2.3373,1.3366,0.5262,0.1951,5.2814,3.7322,2.8467,1.7272,3.3695,3.2124,0.7937,2.1683,6.4779,4.3988,3.4927,1.2303,4.7126,4.8551,1.8079]}

The manned mission in space would have been different from the Moon missions. It would have been a longer flight lasting about 90 days.\nThe concept of the manned Orion is derived from the idea of the Big Gemini.

This version is especially suited to be fitted with various machine gun or special equipment mountings. Storm was the official reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft of the RAF during the 1940s and became the standard British bomber reconnaissance aircraft in the late 1940s. Storm 3 is intended specifically for use in heavy fighting, such as in the D-Day campaign of 1944. As such, Storm is highly aerodynamically-adapted to combat flying conditions. The Storm 3 was designed as a lightly armored, two-passenger bomber reconnaissance aircraft, for missions as both a bomber and a reconnaissance unit, with a role in close air support, anti-submarine warfare and in operations against shipping during times of war. The initial Storm 3 was designated as a \" reconnaissance bomber \", due to the aircraft being equipped with the same basic avionics, radar, and weapons as a bomber aircraft, allowing it to be loaded with radar for anti-ship missions. Once the anti-ship missions were established as being a major success, the aircraft was converted to dedicated reconnaissance duties. From November 1943 onward, the aircraft was officially designated as a \" reconnaissance bomber \". This designation persisted through the 1940s. Some Storm 3 aircraft were initially equipped with an electronic battle search scope, which was installed onto the aircraft by June 1950.","token_len":276,"entropy":[9.9999,6.9115,13.9954,4.0118,5.6243,7.9196,7.0187,1.9868,6.0523,9.0803,1.6746,0.1759,2.8945,5.5448,1.8147,5.1945,0.9286,3.4185,1.0864,3.1357,6.61,2.2641,5.8976,1.514,1.3015,5.2064,5.0431,0.5958,6.1664,6.5535,2.2531,4.496,5.6592,4.1386,11.1842,0.6249,0.8138,5.0005,7.9338,3.5664,6.069,8.4235,1.9636,5.2438,2.7075,0.4639,0.203,4.3369,2.0505,0.7911,4.6936,0.3608,0.8225,5.9731,1.2982,4.006,5.7819,4.2978,7.3593,0.9235,1.5238,0.9957,1.9927,1.2222,0.0239,0.4818,1.8028,2.6113,2.2465,5.5,5.8771,0.3194,2.0579,1.1644,5.1844,4.3345,2.912,2.9653,0.0015,2.8904,1.3577,6.9318,1.0079,0.0441,3.7884,3.1487,1.201,0.7505,5.1356,2.0922,0.3911,2.5728,2.4015,4.0797,8.1895,1.5189,0.0126,3.985,5.7537,0.7837,1.5376,3.3568,6.2863,1.9407,1.0521,2.0828,1.9738,0.6544,3.4083,2.2855,2.7634,0.4058,7.526,3.1109,2.8597,5.2569,0.1709,6.5667,0.0216,3.7495,4.1069,0.3984,1.8787,5.0045,6.3969,4.7313,5.1892,1.0243,3.6393,0.3102,1.4902,1.0748,5.2479,2.42,2.2681,1.8078,6.4827,0.9578,6.2205,1.1187,0.0279,2.5265,4.1718,0.0287,1.3888,0.0023,0.9856,0.7474,4.688,4.6973,1.2149,8.4,5.4539,8.7143,0.0118,1.3309,0.147,1.5717,6.0239,2.8899,0.7355,1.1603,5.4298,1.8793,0.6092,2.9965,9.3831,3.3602,3.259,4.5401,0.1043,1.2884,4.934,2.463,2.8895,0.0787,2.812,2.9083,3.6831,5.0273,0.0232,3.0354,4.1823,1.2408,1.2936,4.9609,1.6339,3.2939,3.2989,4.4155,1.8392,5.3235,1.1606,0.0774,1.5697,6.7445,0.684,6.2206,4.6126,5.0596,0.0072,2.6955,4.8883,0.7003,6.0369,1.4858,8.0933,0.0043,0.5632,3.1641,0.5976,6.0756,4.5879,3.1999,3.2473,2.8187,5.4173,0.4529,0.5696,1.7546,0.471,3.9122,0.4924,8.5464,1.3114,4.8124,1.4109,5.7794,5.1052,2.2101,2.917,0.1616,0.6978,1.5708,0.4406,5.8819,1.3719,1.1127,0.3816,1.3441,1.2055,1.3328,1.5957,2.9397,0.498,8.1151,2.2745,0.976,5.2969,0.032,2.1551,5.5528,3.6388,1.0283,2.7018,0.5198,5.7179,3.3844,0.0604,3.5666,4.523,6.2409,10.7866,6.359,1.0566,2.1232,1.3969,5.0447,5.2041,0.4651,1.3742,2.9693,6.3517,5.1134,0.3852]}

In three seasons, Johnson posted a total of 42 interceptions out of 49 attempts, three touchdowns and an interception, and four interceptions.\nOn February 16, 1998 Minnesota, with Michael Irvin and Chris Jones injured, gave Johnson and Al Snow as free agents. With Snow already signed with the Raiders, the Seahawks signed Johnson. That was the end of Johnson playing professionally.\nOn June 20, 2000, Johnson transferred to the University of Arizona as a member of the USC Trojans program.\nAnd so ended the career of one of the greatest receivers in baseball history. Johnson is ranked fifth all-time for career interceptions in the NFL. His career total of 41 interceptions encompasses several notable events.\nOn March 31, 1974, a 245-pound Johnson intercepted a pass by the Detroit Lions' Jim Pugh on Detroit's fourth and three-point conversion, which won the Lions for the first time on the road in the NFL since the 1930 season.","token_len":277,"entropy":[9.8451,5.7873,0.6364,0.0063,4.9753,9.1548,2.3733,0.7501,1.6941,0.0146,0.7797,0.1067,7.7017,0.7438,4.5783,0.6541,4.1011,0.0549,1.1041,2.3883,4.25,0.3013,0.766,4.1152,16.86,7.0593,8.7188,6.1448,2.9831,2.6489,3.9478,5.0949,0.2462,4.8065,1.5678,4.8224,0.1501,0.1665,14.672,0.3236,0.0122,2.4859,2.6526,0.4489,1.7181,8.7308,5.4379,7.5744,0.6396,4.8928,3.4515,6.1639,0.3782,1.7414,1.8672,3.9925,3.7808,2.8129,0.8859,2.6427,2.8652,7.3974,6.7125,1.1759,5.4993,0.4409,0.8688,5.15,3.5836,2.1575,4.2477,2.477,0.217,1.2616,3.816,2.0565,0.1601,2.6507,4.2635,1.9014,1.038,0.0548,0.9666,0.4944,2.9181,7.5532,0.8417,1.5866,3.106,4.222,0.8018,4.9244,0.0728,6.1473,4.5824,8.4517,0.0028,4.2608,3.6162,1.803,4.9262,1.6889,0.4012,3.9702,0.1408,5.8613,1.7828,5.0507,1.2747,2.4662,1.0944,4.2343,3.4204,3.5275,0.1243,1.646,7.8337,5.1654,2.8992,6.934,2.697,0.002,2.3735,4.7001,4.0757,5.9727,0.4029,4.0497,0.8026,4.8117,5.7433,0.1799,7.5074,4.2667,0.2306,1.2478,4.3091,3.2693,5.7756,3.691,3.5142,0.4129,4.2193,0.4725,1.6594,2.0155,2.6123,1.1184,3.3123,5.5611,3.0847,1.5168,2.8128,0.1347,2.4339,5.846,5.6639,1.7398,0.7387,2.7878,2.2944,3.4025,0.0294,1.8517,0.855,2.5805,5.9619,0.3065,1.1129,4.8597,0.0035,3.9223,3.6888,0.5185,5.3547,0.0049,0.1489,7.0889,1.6511,0.0001,0.0,6.5378,0.3863,1.6604,6.7905,3.1308,6.2442,1.3195,2.7863,0.1469,4.5748,0.1127,0.2304,1.6097,4.5438,0.4593,5.543,1.3226,0.6129,2.9342,3.5834,5.096,4.2299,2.3802,0.3301,0.0119,3.3443,2.1441,3.1627,1.819,1.3611,1.0044,1.417,3.5714,2.1685,2.8682,1.3647,4.2333,2.3684,10.6281,6.7965,5.4832,3.6283,1.5292,0.6239,3.7262,2.5157,3.9003,0.0392,6.8621,0.3464,4.0006,11.2182,0.6462,0.4977,2.3399,3.2984,1.2348,1.2504,2.3931,3.2272,4.7297,0.8595,2.685,4.6003,5.4823,3.0694,2.9443,6.9954,0.1118,5.2472,4.3113,9.1555,1.9529,1.5285,1.0115,2.8846,3.0387,4.9282,0.3156,3.7867,6.6331,0.3575,0.5694,0.0216,5.2486,1.7487,1.335,1.1458,2.7316,2.1321,5.7274,2.6426,4.9366,2.3548,0.193]}

He was introduced by Roger Thornhill, who made a movie about a future where everyone was overweight and was able to afford medical technologies that enabled them to live and work forever. Hooper, thinking this was like the old American dream, decided to become a director to be able to make his own movie. To have the full control of the movie, it had to be made in America, with a director that had never done a movie before. On the day of the shoot, Hooper decided to use the name Ridley Scott while writing the script and the first director of the movie was named Rick Baker, who was later taken down, probably because he couldn \u2019 t understand the script properly.\nHooper was approached by a studio who would make his movie for a very low rate, as it isn \u2019 t a big studio. Hooper accepted the offer. The movie was shot with a green screen. Hooper wanted an actor that looked like a man from the future in a space ship. He turned to the actors Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone and they both said yes, but before the shoot started, the studio wanted to change the name of the actor and the director to Steven Soderbergh.","token_len":277,"entropy":[10.8254,0.6726,5.448,1.1539,8.5506,2.196,8.3011,9.2774,4.2602,5.6775,2.086,11.3884,0.1065,5.4091,0.7533,1.1894,3.3837,1.0242,7.611,2.5118,0.3235,7.6514,0.0185,4.3492,6.2444,1.3293,0.6346,6.9834,11.6467,0.6901,0.6319,1.7893,2.1859,6.0645,2.7227,6.6568,13.8688,1.5665,0.756,1.0727,4.9992,1.9554,4.4463,1.5944,1.5666,6.6012,4.1588,5.0087,2.3022,7.9561,1.2508,4.3731,4.2688,0.008,3.8449,6.0989,10.7352,1.991,3.6057,1.2295,0.0165,1.6613,4.0816,0.5469,7.7445,0.2185,1.9439,0.0017,3.4057,9.9622,3.4372,1.0787,6.2979,2.7495,5.3041,5.4329,1.2354,0.7013,2.5488,0.252,4.6835,0.5797,2.7674,3.9336,5.3132,1.4613,0.0074,2.0238,2.3157,1.3251,3.2546,0.8324,5.4546,6.1347,2.1591,6.288,5.9092,0.7285,1.1843,3.2426,1.4541,4.6231,2.4446,0.0305,0.4961,1.7271,1.7549,4.8109,1.5276,2.7041,2.2443,4.0581,3.6549,2.7714,3.6401,3.4132,0.9966,1.7546,0.2299,0.5216,5.8254,1.5404,2.3686,1.3379,0.8422,2.244,0.2519,1.1457,0.0022,4.4986,0.4439,5.1139,1.6778,5.3022,6.6066,0.1012,6.4713,4.2684,0.8347,0.4605,2.5787,4.1292,4.0085,4.1745,2.8611,0.3798,1.6789,1.1025,4.2362,6.8541,4.6495,1.5359,0.7918,1.619,4.5253,5.5791,4.2827,3.4948,5.934,1.0471,1.1011,4.0484,18.453,7.8429,7.9665,3.878,1.2876,4.0596,5.1237,0.4479,2.9514,7.7825,0.0008,2.2382,4.3964,0.2029,2.5495,3.885,3.0646,3.868,3.3005,2.1692,2.7831,3.7381,2.1859,4.5953,1.9345,5.9619,1.5175,4.2202,1.913,7.8202,4.0021,0.384,4.3843,2.9232,3.6405,2.1736,1.3217,3.0231,0.0013,6.38,1.1252,0.5342,2.4603,2.144,3.5201,0.7496,2.5955,3.1925,1.3318,7.1215,0.9547,3.2111,2.6273,0.0016,4.0234,4.5711,3.4283,1.6723,3.9606,0.6387,2.6497,2.8235,4.1822,1.1072,2.4047,4.7707,0.9669,6.3631,6.767,1.4105,1.6393,5.8754,1.1577,2.2303,4.7148,6.3826,1.8241,0.1129,0.0,0.6494,7.533,0.421,1.9594,2.9773,3.9195,2.3377,1.6007,1.9415,2.5742,5.0482,2.392,3.7289,2.3213,0.4577,2.356,3.7168,3.4001,0.4586,4.8479,0.5346,1.7357,0.6597,0.1475,6.0773,2.867,2.9342,1.936,2.4635,4.631,2.8824,0.0159,0.0001,0.001,0.4349]}

Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club praised Stefani's vocal delivery, saying her `` nasal voice suits the whiny sentiment of the subject matter perfectly. She also has a cool delivery, not so overdramatic that it makes the lyric sound outlandish. \u201d Jon Pareles from Entertainment Weekly felt similarly about Stefani and wrote, ``... Stef's lyrics are overblown in a kind of self-important, childishly naive way, but her delivery and rhythmic powerhouse vocals elevate it above the maddeningly self-confident, childish chatter that is the song's essence. \u201d Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song `` quite a bit of fun. \u201d  Jeff Danko from USA Today noted Stefani's nasal vocals, and wrote that she `` shows off a few big riffs on the song, giving it a little more groove and swing. \u201d\nThe song became a number 2 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, her ninth consecutive number 2 hit on the charts. As of January 2021, the song is Stefani's 8th and 14th top 10 hit on the chart. It also reached number one in Canada, Scotland, and Portugal, and appeared on the top ten in Israel, Switzerland, Finland and Denmark as well.","token_len":277,"entropy":[8.7376,8.0395,8.209,0.8979,0.0904,1.5092,4.071,1.4149,2.1922,8.592,9.1104,2.5028,0.1533,5.5419,2.1786,6.839,0.6316,0.0154,0.0121,0.0,3.055,12.1962,0.9388,0.7314,4.2725,1.3904,1.0903,5.0116,5.2014,12.9956,17.6702,1.523,9.3441,0.9375,10.9868,2.1141,7.9883,1.037,0.7638,5.9075,2.7415,6.7253,1.8907,2.4198,4.5368,1.9679,0.7999,5.1621,4.2393,1.8613,5.2477,3.6792,8.5665,3.6277,0.0947,1.9792,1.2669,2.9003,2.595,6.0245,3.9249,8.0657,1.1636,11.1254,7.2451,11.0576,5.8628,4.8747,3.9973,2.0956,6.6202,0.0811,5.9259,5.6156,2.3104,2.7253,0.002,3.5826,4.6467,1.1475,0.9728,7.1818,3.0105,11.139,3.2341,0.912,6.6763,3.0055,3.9106,2.1727,6.5137,0.0086,5.0086,0.0329,3.63,2.7509,6.4712,4.0708,4.9506,0.228,1.3585,1.094,2.8496,2.3584,2.7279,7.2769,0.0003,11.3357,7.1757,6.6691,3.7433,2.3468,1.3453,5.8923,2.4441,0.0171,2.0849,4.3492,0.0225,5.6081,0.6711,2.3802,5.477,6.5352,1.9016,2.5858,1.8304,4.8985,1.14,6.6679,1.1865,4.4029,0.1205,5.8201,6.2283,10.3266,3.3155,0.0468,0.409,6.524,3.0006,4.2265,1.7122,1.0096,1.5882,9.2501,2.6432,3.2162,0.9464,0.964,2.4488,4.8711,0.1522,4.9993,11.9538,5.3333,7.013,2.2392,0.2814,6.8626,0.0497,4.6848,4.1191,0.0018,0.529,7.2592,5.2421,2.3716,2.7138,3.1296,2.1296,1.4942,2.7153,5.7319,2.3442,1.9086,5.0332,5.9305,6.6395,0.3217,2.9915,1.6186,3.5911,1.3562,5.8671,1.1493,0.5868,3.264,1.2538,7.0615,1.3118,8.3116,2.0043,3.6828,0.0581,5.5193,3.4817,1.7857,5.4504,1.11,5.6101,5.6094,1.0426,1.6242,1.0252,3.7292,0.0006,0.1443,0.0235,1.0675,1.6115,0.0193,1.5858,8.4089,5.0583,4.3112,2.7565,3.463,0.4281,3.562,0.1977,3.2522,0.5954,5.0422,1.0159,3.3085,9.0216,0.0863,1.1885,0.509,2.0338,11.2057,0.0087,0.0663,5.0129,0.0255,4.1427,4.6024,0.0019,2.0019,0.6346,3.1768,3.4759,0.3868,2.3657,0.6183,3.4407,3.011,3.748,1.6759,2.2,2.1313,4.1012,1.2575,7.6498,0.3081,1.2958,6.4287,1.381,1.7279,7.5375,0.5193,0.6933,3.5134,1.9277,1.9854,6.479,0.6099,4.2317,0.083,4.6537,2.9471,4.147,4.8015,0.1345,0.7514]}

According to a report by The Bangkok Post, the Prime Minister denied any such accusations by the former Prime Minister and said that he and his ministers have `` no reason to hide details of the investigation into the 2006 bombings because it is not a secret case ''. In response, Chavalit stated that Saprang's accusation had been `` not only untrue but also dangerous, unprovoked and inappropriate ''. In a meeting with top aides on 3 February, Saprang announced that the government would use civil and criminal procedures to deal with Chavalit's comments. According to a report by the Phayathai News, Chavalit subsequently filed a complaint with the Supreme Court, and has not been seen since. On 5 December, Saprang announced that the Supreme Court could be suspended during the Bangkok New Year, as it was during the 1997 military coup, to allow for a peaceful occasion, and that it would restore civil laws and procedures during that period. On 22 January 2007, the Bangkok New Year was cancelled, and civilians were allowed back onto the streets after a two-year government ban.","token_len":279,"entropy":[8.1335,12.0026,6.6355,3.322,7.1093,6.5712,0.1976,5.8511,3.1647,0.0107,4.884,8.9315,6.0219,13.9224,11.059,4.9443,5.7518,9.5756,1.2344,8.9807,8.4332,7.1602,0.6553,2.005,1.9409,4.0291,6.2013,4.6661,0.0507,0.0121,4.3307,0.5655,0.0596,8.1509,1.2586,8.665,0.0232,4.0698,0.7689,11.7662,7.1114,8.1856,5.1654,7.3216,0.002,2.1134,2.981,0.7251,7.4869,7.4589,1.9506,4.6164,0.9644,0.1882,1.0961,0.2736,5.2789,7.9349,6.6581,5.7519,0.0037,3.7121,2.1738,1.2292,3.511,1.8404,0.3079,0.533,1.81,4.413,0.007,4.75,2.6277,3.1966,3.0179,5.5527,2.9287,3.3515,2.0843,0.012,2.0907,1.9174,1.022,1.3004,4.4292,0.8358,4.0093,2.4369,5.1693,3.4427,4.5002,0.1153,4.9432,7.2186,0.9059,0.9721,3.2949,2.566,0.3848,3.2324,1.1769,4.3705,2.4435,0.9025,2.1827,2.5697,3.8915,4.4356,7.0597,1.3981,3.7714,3.1295,1.0752,1.8927,0.0269,0.0032,5.1478,0.2966,5.0307,0.0058,2.7624,4.3474,3.7097,0.7394,3.624,4.4203,3.0976,3.4444,0.7519,1.3254,5.5718,2.9189,5.5317,2.3698,1.765,0.7022,6.5366,5.6334,1.1636,3.2414,2.6082,3.5889,0.5696,6.4538,5.2141,3.3647,5.7861,2.3817,1.4232,2.7558,0.0028,5.2539,0.3097,1.7825,3.1475,0.9361,5.5685,7.0477,2.2871,1.2014,3.604,0.3521,5.2429,0.0237,4.5135,0.0049,0.0013,1.8477,7.4616,1.0378,3.8417,0.0011,2.0276,1.1956,0.4422,1.3483,6.6124,7.7749,6.0307,5.8942,2.1933,1.0467,1.0656,0.0062,0.0023,6.7576,5.6105,0.466,1.6092,0.733,0.3042,2.7966,0.0839,2.7253,3.1014,4.4731,4.3036,0.9136,4.2237,0.6295,0.2448,4.1837,2.9889,4.5436,0.449,2.6997,0.0037,3.6224,0.4231,1.586,3.1958,0.0128,4.3939,4.378,6.6747,6.3765,0.6024,6.8126,1.0941,0.0098,3.7861,3.1474,1.9345,2.009,6.8007,0.625,7.0065,5.4702,0.3285,2.6956,4.2252,2.1346,2.3254,2.2196,4.1044,10.0604,3.2231,1.8076,1.9955,2.4681,0.5745,5.9442,4.9346,5.9294,1.6352,4.5208,4.3251,3.3465,1.1357,0.2771,2.631,4.3165,1.6353,4.8604,0.0828,1.6031,4.1186,3.1853,0.0085,2.2391,3.3971,1.5481,1.2306,9.2893,1.1552,1.7895,3.9822,3.3703,0.5577,0.2641,2.6788,2.0354,4.2688,0.281,2.8516,5.6242,2.6576,0.9767]}

According to Alice in Chains website, the band chose to include pop elements in the mix in order to appeal to an extended audience. The band's lead vocalist Layne Staley believed that heavy metal music had a tendency to lose its appeal. Staley is believed to have been instrumental in introducing the band into the sound of grunge, by mixing metal and popular music into the same music genre. Some of the other bands that influenced the band were Soundgarden, Metallica and Nirvana.","token_len":279,"entropy":[6.5279,2.4115,3.7409,3.374,4.2349,8.6119,2.8915,2.7292,4.967,1.2651,9.7982,3.7282,3.112,4.3397,6.0539,0.7057,3.61,5.6564,5.9077,2.6477,3.029,1.7048,2.5656,0.8977,0.5604,3.442,3.2337,5.3068,6.0053,1.0978,0.5236,3.11,2.6735,1.4826,0.1982,1.6252,0.746,0.0005,3.7894,3.7824,0.0297,1.0997,1.1298,0.8802,5.0233,4.4054,2.4589,2.0688,2.0098,1.6653,4.8721,5.875,0.152,0.3267,0.9826,11.5966,0.4878,7.8998,1.9669,7.39,1.219,6.5503,1.098,0.7527,2.1257,1.356,4.3716,1.3018,0.4437,4.3711,0.5017,6.4421,4.7525,8.6247,4.5214,0.5392,2.1998,3.6092,1.4863,4.7699,0.2919,5.7931,6.9505,6.2482,4.6733,6.1993,0.5727,8.7984,2.4355,2.1706,1.682,3.3809,5.5242,0.4625,2.0517,1.5124,1.1173,2.5476,3.7391,1.175,0.6793,1.7672,0.0298,3.9576,1.1069,3.5092,0.1852,0.0527,5.9652,1.5519,2.3788,1.7623,3.2042,0.211,1.2425,1.1434,1.3133,10.3926,3.396,0.389,0.1005,0.9283,0.0611,0.0004,1.6479,0.7705,0.7826,0.6351,3.4365,1.4445,4.0035,3.2094,0.163,0.6004,1.6302,1.4668,1.353,5.7375,2.2541,5.6284,3.6834,1.2194,1.6547,1.8947,4.7463,4.5211,4.3363,0.2334,0.2594,0.0089,0.0007,0.0056,0.0022,1.605,2.0759,4.6871,5.6357,8.1542,1.1882,0.0006,1.1363,0.0624,0.0004,8.7391,0.8943,6.2302,0.0063,4.6823,2.2355,2.3791,4.9842,0.6888,3.6087,3.4536,6.7183,0.001,4.637,4.4409,0.9933,6.1488,0.001,2.2911,0.1017,0.0008,3.6017,0.6114,1.4654,0.6911,5.2232,1.4699,5.0981,3.4858,1.2265,1.3712,1.8933,3.9672,3.6205,0.4948,0.0258,3.4272,0.0598,3.9327,6.613,0.3416,0.5733,1.6179,0.8867,1.7323,4.9706,1.7265,0.0145,11.1952,1.4252,5.1528,4.026,8.7884,0.5355,4.4264,0.1086,3.4492,3.1115,1.2398,4.0223,0.2813,4.9246,0.5267,1.3455,3.3695,2.2484,0.0009,4.8225,4.5197,0.0348,0.1739,1.8159,4.2102,0.0973,4.9555,1.0058,1.1067,3.5541,0.6598,4.726,0.2653,6.1853,0.024,2.1116,5.6831,4.1259,3.7204,1.5972,6.2009,1.0699,3.0896,1.8877,3.5473,4.2324,3.9644,0.3943,5.6223,0.9572,0.3377,4.6318,4.2228,1.9679,3.2547,0.7145,0.293,2.6813,6.0653,0.4245,0.0228,0.2692,3.8795,0.0009,2.196,4.1262,0.2444]}

For Alfred Thayer Mahan and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital to any nation attempting to become an international power.\nThese days, in any of the major world powers, the national marine is the second most expensive function \u2013 after the military \u2013 after defence.\nThe US military and national marine have grown at an annual rate of over 13 per cent each year since 1991.\nBut there is a paradox.\nIncreased spending does not automatically increase size and effectiveness \u2013 it will do so if it is put to good use.\nFor example, the military are moving to a system of small, versatile ships and airships for combat operations, while the navy has increased its speed of movement, moving troops into areas of conflict quickly and efficiently.\nAnd the more ships there are in the sea the greater the risk of accidents.\nShips are now designed to withstand much higher speeds and much more energy than before, and the risk is increased by the development of nuclear power.\nFactors such as the increasing use of electronic warfare and the rapid development of unmanned systems mean that maritime defence is being transformed and that this poses challenges for naval staff and for the industry that supports them.\nThe future of Naval Staff is very much a future of risk and uncertainty.","token_len":279,"entropy":[8.5028,1.0639,2.7772,4.5856,3.8868,6.5748,0.0318,8.9032,1.3359,1.2052,4.9968,11.6164,6.0924,1.5917,8.9086,3.214,3.1161,1.4272,3.0266,0.5612,3.7239,5.11,2.6919,0.9496,4.4943,0.5114,1.7803,2.2736,0.0329,3.1455,4.1076,2.5286,0.8116,8.9866,0.4981,0.973,0.9945,0.7046,3.3338,0.1389,4.8441,2.4274,6.3835,0.1334,5.1045,2.6565,3.5612,0.6061,0.1315,1.7047,9.4826,3.3737,0.4606,4.1527,5.5947,5.1545,0.4745,3.1428,2.9348,0.7599,0.4624,1.5937,6.2904,6.6678,6.5816,1.5452,5.4745,1.1263,6.755,8.1332,6.1713,3.5451,1.8607,2.6955,2.6427,3.2677,5.6754,0.3681,2.6051,1.9725,4.2486,2.9689,4.1812,5.7957,2.8665,3.0086,5.3948,4.7666,1.4177,3.5233,0.2222,0.1438,3.162,5.7764,2.6592,0.0051,2.8626,1.0976,1.4696,4.6213,0.7511,1.9058,3.703,3.2186,0.7993,1.3792,5.5567,1.6291,1.9818,8.0414,3.6089,4.7814,0.0889,4.1845,2.2274,8.9266,2.8939,5.052,3.9155,1.4873,4.7385,5.3113,0.6702,4.0022,2.1519,0.8221,5.1584,1.6366,2.0232,0.021,0.3759,0.7391,3.7468,0.9719,0.0462,1.5529,3.0108,7.1258,6.9258,2.5317,2.8543,4.133,0.766,5.6159,2.6547,7.1767,2.1782,3.427,5.8564,3.0639,4.5432,4.7891,2.9363,1.7207,2.7945,0.8578,1.5116,1.9748,4.3493,0.568,6.0425,3.137,3.7541,2.7895,7.064,6.2197,3.8399,3.4927,2.1297,5.1287,4.5192,0.9896,1.9068,0.4747,0.3316,3.6373,1.9568,5.1114,2.9664,3.7759,0.018,2.0685,1.0861,2.2157,3.0648,2.9317,0.3492,3.6132,0.3404,2.7437,0.8957,0.3927,6.0498,0.9956,1.5815,3.0353,4.9883,0.6536,4.1,5.1635,2.6876,3.3596,1.4955,4.4972,1.6869,5.3492,1.6311,2.5004,1.1273,1.4979,2.6733,4.9868,2.2699,3.0773,1.8745,1.6098,6.2042,0.0601,5.899,3.041,1.2817,0.2806,10.0063,1.5546,1.6086,0.0031,1.7825,3.8167,2.2626,0.0107,5.4715,0.4346,1.6155,1.2038,4.3824,1.618,0.0281,4.0549,3.1686,3.1117,0.391,6.3066,3.9854,1.2651,3.7444,4.9292,4.2175,5.0941,4.3958,6.8727,4.8442,0.853,5.2752,6.1215,1.6296,6.0167,1.0901,5.7448,3.8874,4.039,0.6175,0.0676,0.1471,2.0112,5.1021,0.4846,6.065,5.6701,2.0329,4.4109,2.2495,4.4351,5.1535,0.677,6.7295,1.8197,1.9955,0.5354]}

A gust front formed at an upper level within this convective line between the two storms. Convective activity moved slowly eastwards, and the second convective line passed close to the Belize region between 1:30 UTC and 6:45 UTC at a speed of approximately 8 m s @1. Several strong convective cells were identified by the 1200 UTC NHC GEMSAT at the west - northwest end of this convective line.

The forests of the National Forest System are in many ways unique in the nation and provide many benefits. But the conditions that can favor forest regeneration are not everywhere the same, such as site preparation and species of trees and shrubs to use, and it is important to choose the best approach where conditions for regeneration are uncertain.\nThe National Forestry Policy, adopted by Congress in 1935 and reauthorized in 1974, established that the Federal Government owns the forests on the Public Lands and that it was primarily responsible for conserving, managing, and maintaining those Forests. This policy also designated the Public Lands as the Nation's first National Forest System.\nThe Boise National Forest is located in southeast Idaho. Boise is the sixth largest city in, and it has a strong business and manufacturing presence. Boise is home to many well-known companies, including International Paper, Idaho Systems, WestJet Airlines, and Boise Cascade Ice Arena. Boise is nicknamed the \"Mountain View of the West\" (and the Capital of Western Forestry). The highest mountain in the National Forest, Mount Bighorn is also in Boise. Boise and nearby Idaho Falls support a large population of deer, elk, fish, and waterfowl on the Boise National Recreation Area.","token_len":281,"entropy":[8.8556,6.835,1.5559,0.0672,11.5594,7.7853,1.9854,3.5461,4.3102,4.3694,2.5706,6.7039,0.0006,0.7626,2.9431,0.0354,1.371,3.2612,6.0007,8.0086,0.0197,2.2537,5.0882,4.9564,5.7039,0.0078,3.3367,0.8263,0.0196,1.1723,5.4323,0.3179,2.4947,5.083,2.0483,1.4708,4.3958,0.1753,0.5976,0.9757,4.194,3.4653,0.4157,4.4094,1.8432,1.1318,2.9451,2.4541,4.9053,3.6188,1.7104,2.1301,3.968,2.1576,6.6658,1.9012,4.9004,9.0405,3.0393,3.8856,1.2884,2.0476,7.8788,6.1728,2.7524,2.9452,5.2093,0.0159,9.9794,5.814,1.1982,7.4559,4.5311,1.9179,2.9685,2.7673,0.0603,4.8493,5.5686,2.7747,2.0578,6.8598,0.6072,2.204,0.3479,6.834,1.5414,2.1341,6.3962,7.054,5.7951,4.9151,2.7507,0.5539,6.9259,0.4129,0.7084,11.6847,2.9041,6.7298,7.2429,5.8233,3.5982,1.5977,1.848,0.2118,4.4009,2.6382,5.2474,0.6772,0.7195,3.6795,0.1812,3.7203,4.4501,1.5957,4.295,0.9551,5.3912,1.9497,2.9789,4.0719,1.8812,7.4739,0.4937,2.4935,2.4306,3.2116,4.0505,7.3844,0.1061,0.0247,4.212,0.0007,3.5795,2.1369,0.6131,0.3239,2.7198,3.3566,7.9551,0.0009,0.5123,3.0433,1.5639,3.0878,6.2675,1.2826,4.9768,0.0635,0.9471,1.8974,6.4787,0.0124,6.8715,1.8467,0.3012,0.7596,0.9369,1.4293,1.7537,8.4613,0.3128,0.0226,1.7773,2.6594,1.2639,6.0343,0.676,1.6498,5.1338,2.4419,1.9794,4.6943,0.5651,3.6568,0.2151,9.2562,0.5349,4.9187,1.7731,1.7653,6.7739,5.6706,1.8437,5.0905,2.0811,0.584,2.743,1.6068,2.0736,0.0086,2.6267,6.2743,0.1597,0.5853,3.4382,0.9854,0.7727,6.9186,4.0899,1.399,5.4609,7.1832,0.4453,6.3431,5.9851,5.808,0.1362,1.2901,5.3488,7.6005,7.6679,6.567,0.2993,2.1348,1.288,9.156,1.1801,0.4958,5.3249,0.5907,6.268,0.4366,0.9585,2.118,1.0248,5.4537,3.8808,2.2376,8.5319,0.2027,4.7902,9.9226,1.4205,1.9517,6.3743,3.2262,0.6068,0.4573,3.6295,0.0663,3.3128,3.4145,6.2264,4.4922,0.008,2.755,4.3995,4.3915,1.3185,0.8995,2.8365,4.7008,4.3669,2.3755,4.0386,7.2612,2.3924,2.1137,2.37,0.1568,5.4254,0.6053,2.2182,0.0041,0.0509,6.4255,0.1249,0.5076,5.8685,0.6812,0.0,4.9843,0.8828,3.0959,2.1238,6.8207,0.1404,0.521]}

Roberts, `` He has a style, '' i. e., a `` tone of voice.''\nHis songs are characteristic of a broad, vigorous manly cadence, rather than of the lyrical grace of Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann, or Brahms. He, therefore, does not fill a wide audience for whom the lighter music of the composers whom he preceded would be more satisfactory.\nThe music of Richard Wagner ( 1813 - 1883 ) is perhaps the most popular and widely played orchestral music of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century. Unlike the music of the classical era, it is, however, more closely associated with a particular time and place than with an artist.\nIt is generally agreed that Wagner's symphonies constitute his greatest work. Other works include three complete operas, the overture to `` Tannhauser '' ( 1859 ), and the `` Ninth Symphony'' ( 1878-83 ), which have both become major works in their own right. But the symphonies, despite their popularity as concert pieces, are primarily lyric and were written for performance by large orchestras rather than by their smaller counterparts.","token_len":283,"entropy":[9.6042,0.4614,12.655,6.7426,0.7454,7.3248,2.7592,1.4364,4.6388,0.1222,2.4714,5.7615,2.0838,5.3804,1.6693,5.0986,4.0426,2.44,1.3113,3.0922,4.8853,0.0075,1.5472,8.4062,2.3615,4.5207,4.3742,0.355,3.2011,2.5049,4.4406,0.0079,4.6581,4.6786,0.9725,5.3331,0.6821,8.5128,9.4273,3.6398,3.6129,7.2682,2.7563,8.0995,7.1289,0.131,2.2331,0.2405,1.435,6.8421,9.0543,2.0745,3.7178,2.7025,2.9476,14.9088,5.5893,2.2057,7.3536,0.2472,1.9472,5.4525,2.9202,6.2372,7.1661,6.0906,7.1535,0.104,1.299,6.2796,0.0471,1.2772,2.8465,6.488,0.0189,7.3657,0.7037,6.7823,0.0493,0.0002,1.9585,4.1412,0.0029,0.256,6.4078,0.015,0.255,4.4423,1.181,0.0075,0.3481,4.2544,0.6842,0.3914,1.8319,3.7528,0.002,0.2793,2.1728,5.6011,4.6565,0.0018,3.5737,0.0501,8.7667,1.9689,5.6414,3.0778,5.2402,5.6374,1.9981,10.2958,3.788,0.7876,2.2366,5.586,0.0581,7.2955,0.3958,7.0132,3.073,1.2626,3.5211,4.4766,0.5513,1.5173,1.9941,3.4372,0.5673,7.2053,1.7525,3.9803,7.5569,4.7787,1.3744,1.5603,3.5145,0.2851,1.3003,4.0811,0.5908,0.7372,4.1032,2.3619,3.369,4.9597,6.0213,0.0212,0.0004,1.1415,0.7119,1.1206,2.6496,2.7852,4.5229,2.7031,3.9635,0.0177,0.1888,0.1241,0.0091,0.331,5.9887,1.9141,3.3629,0.0807,2.8108,3.4282,5.3452,0.3511,2.3304,0.9918,4.9443,2.8374,0.0052,3.5411,5.6361,1.7167,0.0441,2.5949,4.3514,4.5309,1.0422,0.9159,1.7461,0.9314,3.5198,5.7972,2.0645,2.3606,3.1671,0.5336,4.9358,2.7725,0.3566,0.8267,1.1179,3.9408,0.1462,0.1058,5.478,4.5384,1.7056,2.0934,0.946,6.4184,2.2878,2.732,6.3058,5.9701,1.9976,0.0157,1.0611,2.6817,9.7568,1.0387,3.4991,5.8021,6.1791,3.8932,5.9446,0.1976,4.6164,0.9682,2.0467,4.4187,0.857,1.4673,1.0643,5.033,7.6098,0.1967,5.0498,0.1363,0.7023,4.0552,4.6118,2.2708,1.9281,1.7333,4.0342,4.2255,4.0133,4.4594,1.8426,1.7477,3.5019,0.1458,0.0077,0.2922,4.234,2.0614,2.5098,0.2643,0.0336,2.8462,5.5821,0.6102,3.5539,3.5341,5.0171,2.5019,0.2482,0.9907,4.9401,8.8356,2.3685,6.2223,3.5185,2.0829,4.9071,3.1116,5.6148,3.0838,0.0014,4.1235,0.0082,3.0475,5.0482,7.6418,3.6934,0.2705]}

These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest other organisms.\nMxB was first cloned from M. xanthus strain DK1622\n\nMxR was cloned from M. xanthus strain DK1622\nA gene coding for a putative transcriptional activator has been cloned in M. xanthus from strain DK1622. The MxR gene was identified using sequence analysis based on the fact that similarities were determined to sequences of a family of transcriptional activators from other organisms.\nMxR was studied because of its potential involvement in M. xanthus development. This role may be linked to the regulation of a gene that is directly involved in this process. Expression of this gene has been studied in the presence and absence of MxR. In the absence of MxR, expression of the M. xanthus myxovirus resistance (mvr) gene is high, and the resulting bacterium has a smooth cell surface. This finding is consistent with evidence that the Mvr gene is an important component in M. xanthus development.\nTwo genes that have been found to be controlled by MxR are MxU and MxA.

In the past, rigs relied on conventional boats or specialized barges to move their crude or natural gas across the water from the sea bed or from an oil rig to another. And with these old models it meant either large amounts of heavy fuel and oil or much less efficient use of a small boat.\nNow, as oil and gas exploration and production moves offshore, more and more companies are using bigger rigs and more fuel to operate them so that they can find more resources far away from shore. But this can also pose problems when it comes to getting the products out of the water and into boats that don\u2019t allow for as much fuel and hydraulic fluid.","token_len":283,"entropy":[11.4485,6.3921,2.6778,12.4006,11.8915,5.5483,1.9043,6.8371,7.418,6.8917,0.1028,0.0021,0.0312,1.1396,5.4946,9.4566,10.7189,7.1311,6.1002,6.2579,5.2504,2.1281,0.3171,6.434,0.4653,1.2914,7.4158,1.0471,1.57,4.8186,0.7644,5.0599,5.5361,5.8306,6.926,2.8577,3.2797,0.0194,6.567,3.6324,2.3395,4.1665,5.8836,0.7041,3.0478,2.3014,7.0322,1.0845,4.8958,3.5041,4.2811,5.5801,1.6403,1.5874,2.4191,6.9519,3.3617,3.3473,1.8763,1.3533,0.1531,5.5457,4.7458,5.9416,0.8739,4.8668,1.8143,4.7091,0.0007,1.8202,0.9254,13.7099,7.5714,4.0748,0.6561,0.1826,0.5551,14.8588,14.0811,0.3281,0.7598,2.9056,5.1333,5.8611,5.8968,0.1553,1.9052,4.8913,6.582,5.118,2.2569,0.127,5.3695,0.0128,0.0034,0.0751,2.0172,3.7595,0.0738,3.9813,1.7,0.2554,4.4594,0.0119,6.0111,6.8905,3.0893,4.3145,0.3143,0.8548,2.0663,2.6533,6.6114,2.5604,6.1696,2.1863,1.2699,3.7124,0.7886,5.0534,6.1771,0.3174,0.674,2.3763,3.8641,1.7395,3.8418,4.4441,1.8433,1.9452,4.1005,1.2628,3.8627,4.859,1.8764,1.6236,3.2851,3.4133,4.4368,0.9209,0.0009,2.9998,1.7093,5.6691,2.7405,0.8135,3.4372,2.8959,1.4331,3.363,2.2178,3.1712,0.4105,5.5135,5.8194,0.2639,5.1983,4.4712,3.6462,6.8087,6.9223,0.0012,0.9247,2.5221,3.4696,3.7778,3.7436,4.0675,0.0269,1.8041,1.1073,2.883,4.8863,1.7579,4.8797,5.8073,4.0372,2.8495,3.4204,1.8481,1.8912,0.788,4.0515,2.2207,4.6637,3.7104,4.0961,8.2734,4.9496,4.9775,7.0485,7.5543,4.7949,3.694,0.029,4.8457,2.5051,3.2007,4.0946,1.6816,4.2121,0.4795,7.005,4.1567,0.0873,3.472,3.4793,3.7822,1.3975,0.4773,3.5486,1.11,3.6221,3.7694,1.5895,0.0886,1.2288,1.1403,0.0583,3.6318,3.3677,0.5809,3.2511,0.488,0.0041,3.1039,0.2343,1.8993,5.5261,1.8744,1.9172,2.7066,4.1959,1.6107,4.8572,1.1665,5.9099,1.031,0.5772,0.3695,5.6883,2.0868,5.4733,7.2463,1.7204,0.4837,2.8544,0.4845,4.2013,3.3967,4.1952,2.5217,4.9187,1.8746,3.4662,1.9456,0.0031,0.0106,4.1542,1.8678,7.0334,3.3558,0.5142,0.5627,2.1206,2.1565,1.373,8.2976,1.8202,3.5517,2.8782,1.2597,0.3469,5.309,1.1291,5.3967,0.7368,2.8305,1.5042,1.7023,0.2614,1.4831]}

Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice of an emperor for his age.\nNerva had already been on several occasions the leader of the Senate, where, in addition to the general, one of the two supreme powers in late imperial Rome. In this case he became the generalissimo of Rome and his predecessor Hadrian was only commander of the forces. The Senate was entrusted with the highest functions in the government ; it was the place where the legates of the Emperor had to report.\nAccording to the Fasti, Nerva entered Rome at the head of his cohort on the night of the 25th, and on the previous day, while the Senate was celebrating the consort of Lucius Verus, he had already occupied office in the triumphal procession that was headed by the Emperors and the Consuls. His brother Flavius, who served as Senate pretor in the year of Flavius ( 112 ), had served as pontiff in AD 106 and the next year, as consul with Lucius Verus.\nIt takes courage not only to rise in power and assume office ; it takes a great deal of courage to face the people. Perhaps Nerva was no coward ; he might simply have been a great, very great man.","token_len":284,"entropy":[10.104,8.93,8.8531,10.0446,6.0445,4.8835,5.5732,3.7589,5.9346,2.1055,0.0435,0.2282,11.9198,2.4761,9.164,4.1233,2.1657,5.6381,2.3495,3.6284,11.4138,10.2123,12.2637,10.3221,3.7943,4.1702,6.8296,3.9807,5.0055,1.3634,7.785,2.2896,4.4156,6.3592,0.6161,3.9632,2.2948,2.2728,6.0344,5.9039,2.0678,4.6304,1.0585,2.7515,2.8121,2.2513,1.3304,1.8962,10.3835,0.0458,2.4474,3.6555,1.5376,5.0311,6.7008,1.1559,3.5813,3.4906,0.0447,0.8118,4.4573,1.1585,6.5224,4.5305,1.7104,3.4565,0.0076,2.3174,4.2846,1.889,6.5312,0.6273,1.0622,3.5178,6.7483,5.5561,2.7616,9.617,5.5904,3.6584,2.1013,2.8123,3.2567,2.7672,3.0663,4.4129,0.873,5.4433,11.5201,0.0411,0.7782,3.6357,1.9649,3.5422,4.4518,7.3702,0.0079,2.3212,6.2139,7.3758,0.7453,0.3031,5.7238,2.5735,2.4808,3.9107,1.7979,5.7582,0.3722,0.9982,6.643,4.2162,2.0595,0.9695,3.4442,9.8876,2.0133,0.9121,2.1724,4.523,0.9758,0.9644,8.4828,1.5129,0.9901,0.646,4.3638,2.7558,1.3174,4.7363,3.0413,1.6141,5.5496,0.1758,1.3624,9.1775,0.0252,0.9728,1.689,0.0006,6.8519,3.095,2.9287,0.5552,4.586,0.0049,3.1412,4.8999,4.9853,1.1459,3.5893,0.1268,1.102,4.4416,0.0539,2.889,1.8089,3.1163,0.567,6.2565,0.9803,2.3758,4.2351,2.2936,1.984,0.3102,4.5858,1.1647,6.7824,4.8871,1.7008,4.5535,6.4199,1.631,0.9406,0.9298,3.2655,3.1153,6.3276,6.6201,2.2561,0.7884,9.5995,0.3961,1.8608,3.7262,2.708,7.2787,1.505,1.9386,6.7704,0.2656,4.536,1.5175,5.106,0.2623,0.6313,4.2268,5.7078,5.0724,0.0904,2.1567,1.6371,5.2159,0.7694,6.3492,10.8561,6.4665,3.6364,0.8885,3.786,3.837,4.6196,0.3979,5.3575,11.8471,3.0708,1.2956,4.7872,0.6919,7.7216,0.3132,1.6281,7.2225,5.9611,1.592,3.2228,3.8158,0.508,1.9508,2.7102,2.7521,0.287,5.9179,4.0149,2.9582,0.0027,1.325,1.4385,3.9064,7.6449,5.7562,2.9773,2.7975,0.1415,6.2509,2.3849,4.5408,3.0689,3.9001,2.3009,5.3932,1.0661,1.9532,3.7459,3.0475,0.4042,0.1062,0.591,0.4082,5.071,1.2496,3.7239,1.5172,6.5895,3.491,0.0013,1.8587,5.0355,3.4569,4.2754,1.8328,3.7259,6.0731,0.4123,1.4967,2.01,4.6933,5.3469,5.689,3.9717,0.8755,0.9927]}

The summit of the peak is home to a 180-foot (56 m) steel and glass arch railway bridge, one of Medford's most popular tourist attractions. Medford also has several peaks that can be reached on trails and roads, with their summits offering a variety of recreational activities including hiking, biking, ATV riding, and rock climbing ; the upper slopes of several of these peaks have been developed into public open space.\n\nGeology\n\nAlmost all of the surface of the peak is composed of the Devonian age Spring Springfield Limestone. The limestone contains fossils that include belemnites, and has layers that are easily crushed into large flakes. Most of the surface is covered by a layer of volcanic rock that lies just below the surface: the rhyolite that formed as an ash flow to the west. The top of the ridge is home to the eastern escarpment fault, which separates and extends out of Roxy Ann Peak from a higher outcrop of Springfield Limestone to the east. The fault has a trace of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) and is offset by about a thousand feet (300 m).

Her last patrol was between the German ports of Scapa Flow and the Dutch coast with a convoy, but she collided with and sank the German merchant ship SS\u00a0Marienburg. Her captain was awarded a promotion for this mission. In November 1941, she headed for Ireland and the North Atlantic Ocean. On 22 November, she was torpedoed and sunk by German U-boat U-100.

Judge Horace P. Blair denied the petition under the same rules. On November 16, 1853, he again denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\nOn September 4, 1857, Martindale moved to a writ of habeas corpus to be granted in all the circuits of the United States. The district court refused to entertain the motion on January 19, 1859. Martindale then had a hearing before Judge Horace P. Blair. Martindale maintained that there was no probable cause to believe he was not guilty of any offense specified in the statute, and that the facts of his arrest were such as to render it impossible for him to support a case for the writ. The motion for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.\nFrom this date up to the time when the statute was so amended as to make it applicable to this case the court held that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was unconstitutional whenever the person arrested was arrested for a crime other than the crime for which he was subsequently tried and convicted under the statute. This is shown in the memorandum to the opinion of Judge Horace P. Blair, to which reference was made in an introductory paragraph.","token_len":284,"entropy":[2.6222,4.6939,9.7829,0.3116,9.8134,3.6696,0.0066,7.0724,4.7739,2.2,4.7135,7.866,1.7627,5.692,0.1141,2.1349,3.6158,3.2527,4.2384,0.8354,0.5563,3.5374,3.8263,2.8994,4.1684,1.0597,5.2115,4.9941,6.245,6.065,3.5202,0.5359,5.551,4.4258,0.9016,5.7392,7.1481,1.1183,4.4102,0.185,8.7548,4.007,0.8816,3.3828,5.7099,1.0011,2.0057,4.1751,1.9678,4.2464,3.5369,3.7079,0.0386,0.4379,3.8167,0.0476,3.1318,5.9593,1.7145,0.3877,0.8306,4.0251,2.0227,0.7799,0.0693,1.1256,0.0,0.0,0.0051,0.9425,1.592,13.9392,4.1616,3.3272,0.0254,0.2602,2.8832,0.0395,2.4697,0.0003,0.0001,5.1137,1.2645,4.8313,2.1708,0.0858,0.2402,0.0005,0.0011,0.0223,3.5724,3.8998,2.8937,1.9168,4.5601,2.2154,6.0209,1.7767,0.9009,0.5235,0.0041,0.7424,1.7758,3.0723,0.194,3.6097,1.0779,5.1822,0.5498,1.189,3.0223,3.6016,4.0933,0.364,0.2914,2.2966,0.9543,3.9483,0.0002,0.0002,3.1441,5.4317,2.3179,1.8901,1.9069,2.9709,4.671,0.0015,0.2725,0.0015,0.0182,1.6921,5.9188,0.0002,0.0002,6.7473,0.5704,3.6409,0.3754,0.5031,5.1341,0.0103,0.8321,2.0479,2.8235,1.0622,3.8842,2.4726,0.5234,2.5112,2.5387,7.962,0.2122,0.3552,2.5382,1.7194,0.7404,0.6243,1.3674,4.6435,1.5313,2.0,2.9048,1.2747,5.0878,0.6985,0.6565,3.1128,2.6716,1.8822,0.5254,0.4426,0.0213,6.7866,1.7424,5.4633,1.3259,3.2987,0.7372,1.2019,1.8734,5.0218,1.8764,1.0216,0.2402,0.3518,0.025,0.0007,0.0013,0.011,0.2631,0.5691,1.0272,1.1041,6.4452,2.1408,2.9906,5.7752,0.4036,1.2613,3.4522,3.8318,0.9431,4.242,0.2381,6.6832,1.3442,2.9968,0.061,2.8003,0.6378,4.4972,0.4118,4.6728,1.1284,4.2459,2.7811,2.9148,0.5587,3.2092,3.4272,0.3066,0.8153,0.0176,0.1037,0.0158,0.0011,0.0012,0.0437,1.0191,5.2515,7.8388,1.2602,4.2822,2.6623,1.0586,4.3614,1.9112,1.2434,1.0772,3.459,0.0034,1.911,2.4917,4.1715,0.0019,0.7652,0.2322,6.5887,5.0824,2.7388,0.3959,4.1557,0.2635,0.6333,0.2868,3.1733,3.5704,5.6865,1.0594,0.6581,7.009,2.7942,0.5466,6.6491,0.3636,0.4914,4.2442,0.0014,0.0228,0.0032,0.0024,1.4257,5.4138,0.7952,6.8093,1.6626,0.3509,1.1671,5.5919,6.8342,3.135,1.6137]}

Although this team began in 1996, a few players had already previously represented it.\n\n1995\n\nMichigan's 1995 team made considerable changes in the roster to the 1996 team as well as the lineup and general approach. After losing most of the senior leaders to graduation and the start of a freshman season with more attention on the 1997 team, several junior players including All-American forward Tarik Black moved up to the starting lineup while the freshmen players in the lineup took a lot of responsibility in many aspects of play and started making more plays for the team. The team began the season with ten players that had already been on the team in 1995, including the previous year's all conference honorable mention, James McCord, along with the new freshmen: David Johnson, Chris Johnson, and DeAngelo Robinson.\n\n1996\n\nThe 1996 team continued the success of its predecessor, by winning their first thirteen conference games and advancing to the NCAA Tournament with a record of 14\u201316. The team again lost in the tournament to Marquette and finished 7\u201313 overall with a 3\u201313 mark in the Big Ten Conference. The team was led by starting point guard James McCord (5.7 ppg, 3.5 rpg) in his senior season.","token_len":285,"entropy":[6.8049,3.9196,1.0843,7.2365,7.2658,9.7015,4.5848,1.9961,13.6431,14.855,8.2751,4.5581,7.6482,1.3584,1.9747,2.6795,2.9576,0.0259,3.2745,0.2452,2.9021,11.436,1.1429,0.0058,0.1748,6.0318,10.1648,3.9022,9.9566,0.6878,0.8015,5.8513,2.9329,2.0487,6.0139,2.4763,3.7839,0.6213,4.8354,2.3229,3.0508,3.9785,2.4644,7.9115,4.1123,6.1043,1.2678,1.4763,0.0074,8.0883,1.7384,0.0002,2.581,2.8756,4.9231,3.3955,3.7963,10.3234,3.1601,2.1571,1.1993,3.8908,3.4264,3.4478,7.3987,2.3288,4.2207,1.4257,1.2908,1.5638,6.1407,3.3895,5.6188,4.7663,1.8659,4.3641,3.7493,5.8186,0.1354,1.5101,4.5596,5.9893,2.2572,4.8907,1.9949,2.2981,5.478,0.0261,2.8941,5.2117,0.8007,4.5998,5.7558,6.6017,1.8805,1.2718,10.5528,1.8602,0.288,6.0033,5.4884,1.3519,5.0974,6.3253,0.2457,0.682,4.2825,8.1618,0.8978,0.8636,6.0014,3.4765,0.7429,0.768,1.9216,0.8026,4.653,2.982,5.1206,4.1395,3.9318,0.5935,4.7014,4.4918,2.2734,5.2023,0.1653,4.4584,3.1182,6.6655,2.9029,0.6024,5.9704,2.5997,6.3209,4.175,3.5429,1.1781,3.2109,0.5248,0.3944,0.3133,2.2149,1.6679,3.6919,2.4879,0.9982,0.9368,6.1251,2.0652,3.4643,1.5892,1.68,1.9292,3.1076,0.2641,1.3459,2.7488,2.577,1.6676,1.8321,3.3803,5.1043,3.0114,0.0525,5.3656,8.7392,6.1828,0.0335,3.7389,5.7788,6.2188,3.5971,1.41,5.8333,0.0019,2.7603,3.9798,2.6925,5.7209,5.8869,4.8378,0.3304,4.824,4.2079,0.1356,2.1593,4.8653,4.3284,6.38,0.1801,1.0822,0.0002,2.05,0.2717,0.0002,1.4452,3.5403,0.6079,4.0645,2.6915,3.2738,0.5479,2.6239,3.5495,1.4446,4.4897,3.1273,3.8411,0.5082,7.7472,3.6844,0.5661,1.6709,3.5815,0.1884,0.1658,2.4141,0.5088,3.5237,0.7536,3.151,0.1851,3.5491,6.2456,4.3091,0.664,1.2937,0.7156,6.0455,2.8594,3.5904,0.2899,3.6826,2.0509,6.312,0.0006,2.1717,3.2646,4.6907,1.6933,3.5085,3.3803,3.6966,0.9883,4.5162,1.5315,4.2946,3.1353,0.9172,0.3467,3.296,0.0886,1.8429,0.5774,1.3893,0.6757,2.294,5.4548,0.0594,6.0034,1.965,0.0218,4.036,1.3092,0.0491,2.8283,3.9296,1.1479,2.4051,1.2425,0.0001,0.6068,1.8771,0.0235,2.2578,0.2889,0.0024,1.1763,3.8487,2.9779,3.7018,0.5246,1.9676]}

Ramsey became the first person to direct a TV sitcom with female leads.\nFrom the same producers of \" The Simpsons \" came \" Star Wars,\" which stars Mark Hamill as Emperor Palpatine. He makes a cameola appearance in the first hour and it might be worth a shot if you don't have the DVD or Blu-Ray version of \" Star Wars : Episode IV - A New Hope,\" but it might be best watched up front, because the action scene's really hard to see.\nAll these shows are good. They range from the ridiculous to the bizarre and some of the more mature ones are very funny and touching. A great show to watch with teens is \" Sex and the City \" and a great show to watch with kids or grandkids is \" Super Nanny.\" When your daughter falls asleep, you can turn the show on in the hallway and everyone will go to sleep. It's a nice way to start day.\nShooting stars or shooting stars, when bright, come from the death throbs of dying stars. Like small particles of dust in an empty stomach, these death dusts are created from the ashes of stars that have burned out of fuel and exploded as supernovas.","token_len":286,"entropy":[8.7551,3.1091,6.4982,5.104,1.0348,0.9754,8.5293,1.9711,4.8944,1.047,11.5017,8.444,8.4535,2.4582,4.3226,4.7204,4.7095,1.1706,6.8735,6.5754,0.0185,9.0723,3.2413,11.8919,2.0625,8.8905,1.3255,10.6973,11.1218,0.4589,3.6866,2.1052,3.5669,4.0867,3.8653,1.6656,12.2362,3.6245,0.0011,2.7188,11.4662,6.3034,2.1433,1.2492,1.9597,0.5993,6.4415,1.269,3.2585,4.7776,3.1191,6.9491,2.5668,1.2877,2.1552,11.1115,1.5715,7.6234,4.7151,3.9092,3.4267,4.9282,3.7989,1.9943,5.4197,1.4296,6.9289,1.3045,5.6512,3.4433,5.3799,4.0605,0.407,0.0,1.4769,7.3551,0.051,0.0002,0.0,1.2847,5.0613,5.9143,1.5303,12.1023,10.1267,3.2322,1.1926,0.8224,2.6023,6.485,2.5519,6.2377,6.5048,0.9912,4.3576,1.8436,3.6523,3.0245,0.7624,3.8921,0.037,3.0351,2.5184,5.0878,2.4467,1.2057,0.0181,2.5199,4.0165,1.3807,1.5122,1.9328,0.0146,6.2943,0.5819,2.005,1.0768,0.3635,0.0003,0.0001,5.0658,1.5468,2.0721,4.2414,1.3667,4.4145,5.7438,7.2622,2.4111,2.7843,2.3425,2.0124,6.0562,3.9895,6.3701,5.3157,4.8744,0.2029,4.138,0.9546,1.6798,6.1198,4.5492,2.8028,1.7828,4.4953,2.303,2.5213,7.2804,0.1353,3.5344,5.5381,0.7003,0.6239,4.5156,2.6969,4.2258,1.1994,1.2895,2.7851,6.1682,1.8619,1.4669,4.5002,2.0597,1.649,5.5204,0.4095,4.4967,4.0356,2.1516,3.466,0.2965,3.2929,8.1005,3.623,0.8265,7.6016,0.3,0.0185,0.0003,2.2038,2.567,3.2372,0.6952,0.5393,0.3243,0.1175,0.3557,2.0655,4.9336,5.7088,0.3911,2.4131,0.1032,5.871,7.0691,1.0904,4.8253,5.8112,4.7743,4.9986,6.3191,2.4292,1.6077,1.0717,1.6456,5.6129,1.8538,3.8091,1.0604,4.0943,1.4168,6.331,1.3833,6.507,1.5239,4.359,2.3763,0.9676,0.6405,3.0649,0.3964,1.5355,4.152,2.3626,0.1416,2.6736,7.0009,5.2276,0.795,6.947,3.5872,6.0049,6.9304,6.0688,1.3441,3.5278,4.6763,10.8207,1.3992,5.8242,2.3798,1.928,10.5492,4.7912,9.183,0.1517,8.1683,2.1728,0.6424,6.0687,8.9831,8.0407,1.7254,1.8783,3.0085,3.6823,4.2765,5.2408,0.7109,2.9266,5.4035,7.1749,2.7582,1.7614,4.8582,3.4365,1.2449,4.5363,0.2117,1.9772,2.0928,1.9132,5.2996,2.054,3.7589,6.5619,2.346,5.6931,4.7478,5.2258,0.4106,2.1194,0.4441]}

The contestants were presented with a question that, in its entirety and without modification, must be solved by either throwing, pulling or moving fingers on the same key at the same time within a specified time limit.\nA panel of experts judged the contestants on both their speed and accuracy. They used a range from one point to two points, where a one-point score was given when a contestant completed the answer in the allotted time but did not meet the accuracy criterion, and a two point score was given for an answer that was both correct and arrived within the time limit.\nAs part of the main game, the 10 contestants would play a `` Last Man Standing '' style elimination game in which they played a round-robin game against each other. The 10 contestants who had the best results through the three preliminary rounds, as calculated by the panel of experts would play a round-robin game against their opponents, with the winner moving on to the quarterfinals. Contestants with either a lowest score or an odd number of points would automatically be eliminated.\nAround the beginning of each `` Last Man Standing '' game there was a special addition known as a \"\" Question Corner \"\" where the ten contestants had the opportunity to pose their own or a friend's questions to the panel of experts.","token_len":286,"entropy":[2.6156,9.072,13.211,1.3814,10.6338,7.6155,3.6917,0.6736,1.6045,6.4527,15.8606,16.3248,3.1352,7.6416,8.1992,3.4239,4.1038,1.0542,6.6205,0.1413,4.3243,1.8485,6.6108,2.0179,3.9261,4.6677,4.7392,0.488,1.7517,3.0315,1.6292,4.5766,0.3772,1.0326,6.315,2.7123,4.7584,2.5517,4.189,2.2865,4.5926,1.9551,5.5599,0.122,4.6817,0.3856,5.8987,1.2141,4.1556,6.9299,3.978,5.3165,1.1204,4.1188,6.1533,3.3541,0.9786,3.4458,5.8584,5.1582,0.7659,0.3334,0.0845,7.3812,1.7483,3.1042,0.6455,3.8966,0.396,2.5022,9.779,5.4765,0.4178,3.8096,5.2074,0.7107,1.6931,2.636,5.3021,2.7044,2.629,0.3225,2.778,1.222,3.1413,5.6733,1.61,4.3416,4.3227,4.2946,4.5212,0.9687,2.5658,0.587,1.463,4.4626,2.5321,4.9398,0.6215,0.7815,3.0863,0.899,4.1837,5.2896,2.1895,0.4566,6.9239,1.4576,7.6797,3.0377,1.9868,4.5407,0.4833,6.1446,3.2053,0.0142,6.3862,0.4759,5.7393,2.6627,2.7439,1.5878,0.8586,0.5872,3.5525,0.2807,0.4183,0.1021,3.5422,4.3145,1.9093,0.8035,1.1697,5.4035,1.78,0.3043,9.7116,2.7561,0.9632,1.9832,0.2791,0.4182,1.1924,4.7781,3.3549,0.0009,0.3719,6.6957,0.7685,0.4166,1.3481,6.7655,0.6298,4.0503,1.9204,1.6102,3.9652,7.835,4.2829,0.0742,1.8443,6.4032,6.1573,0.8393,2.7866,0.2486,0.9637,3.7765,1.7517,3.8555,4.0275,0.2264,0.0003,1.8874,3.6898,0.8667,0.0199,1.3545,1.2158,4.0361,0.5249,3.7223,2.6757,1.8079,1.9933,4.0333,6.559,0.5704,4.1065,8.0479,0.3271,3.3286,3.551,6.7096,0.4831,0.6799,3.1373,1.3074,0.226,7.3276,2.5099,1.8418,2.4027,0.2139,0.0095,0.0002,0.3358,1.6522,4.3205,1.8488,2.1405,2.6747,1.0002,1.6509,6.3563,2.383,0.2633,0.3103,4.1545,0.1952,0.8109,6.9695,0.0252,3.7998,6.6955,1.5909,7.3789,0.849,0.6192,3.1387,5.648,0.9601,0.1481,0.775,1.5427,5.7533,1.331,0.388,0.9135,0.8272,8.1943,1.0514,3.7085,0.0261,1.8265,5.6365,1.5816,0.0035,0.0031,0.6764,1.8674,5.7255,1.7837,0.5173,4.7032,9.8008,7.9054,0.0113,0.7801,9.0508,7.9012,9.2673,5.436,2.2902,1.4129,7.5674,0.3002,2.9881,2.0895,1.4658,0.018,5.8074,2.5587,2.3901,7.7794,2.4993,3.3767,0.0895,1.6257,1.8727,1.0492,2.4739,0.604,0.2522,0.5171]}

{"prompt":"Ceratopsia appears to have originated in Asia , as all of the earliest members are found there . Fragmentary remains , including teeth , which appear to be neoceratopsian , are found in North America","text":"Ceratopsia appears to have originated in Asia, as all of the earliest members are found there. Fragmentary remains, including teeth, which appear to be neoceratopsian, are found in North America, Germany, France, and China on the Late Triassic ( approximately 251 million years ago ) or even Early Jurassic ( approximately 213 million years ago ) beds in which other dinosaurs and pterosaurs are also present. These fragments, which indicate a size similar to that of C. tympanum, were compared in detail with other C. tympanum specimens in a search for homologies with other ceratopsians. The most common similarity is that with the large skull of a neoceratopsian, such as C. tympanum. Other similarities to C. tympanum are a dorsal keel on the snout, which indicates a snout with a relatively long length relative to the skull width, and relatively deep frontal sinuses with large frontal crests in the C. tympanum specimen from China. The long snout with the elongate upper jaw, and elongate nasal bridge in the C. tympanum specimen in China appears not to be very unlike the C. crameris specimen. These similarities, therefore, indicate that C. ceratops may be an intermediate form, an ancestor of C. tympanum.","token_len":286,"entropy":[7.5802,5.5443,1.4514,3.4954,8.4288,0.4036,1.7263,4.4403,0.8621,3.9479,1.2422,4.055,6.8998,2.6366,0.6435,5.1902,6.1269,4.0937,3.379,3.9931,0.6184,9.211,1.9414,1.1328,4.1533,3.5589,2.4748,4.6067,0.7234,5.9127,3.7528,0.1943,1.3589,10.6968,4.0978,0.0492,0.1691,0.2195,0.5509,1.3578,1.3179,0.5603,4.0606,0.2668,1.0266,6.5646,0.2039,2.318,0.209,1.4712,3.8313,7.2589,1.3848,7.4515,2.9371,0.0007,2.975,10.7093,9.2626,0.8752,0.1075,0.2527,2.5114,4.55,4.7239,6.7348,1.5261,0.2677,2.1428,7.1395,0.0596,0.0063,0.0068,1.3619,7.5159,3.8328,5.811,5.7565,3.7636,3.4814,6.8841,0.1498,0.0924,3.1798,4.2551,1.8013,0.2739,3.1016,5.2247,2.7795,1.6138,6.211,2.2046,10.1646,4.8949,0.026,1.0833,0.5567,5.6867,2.0072,8.0671,1.0926,2.3731,0.9765,0.6096,2.3477,8.2214,3.5955,3.6741,0.7955,3.64,4.1184,0.8084,0.6725,0.0008,0.0903,0.0095,2.0552,2.7792,3.2778,5.7555,0.2375,5.4056,5.5154,3.6471,2.6535,5.0105,0.0271,0.0202,1.7939,0.7994,1.9079,3.6803,2.9489,5.7386,1.7267,1.6507,5.8518,1.7595,5.2003,3.9564,1.4992,3.3945,6.693,0.1072,0.0216,0.0654,0.0463,0.8681,4.3876,0.8756,2.0633,0.0559,0.4001,0.0009,0.0132,0.0012,6.0229,4.8292,2.1779,4.8251,1.0306,0.0016,0.0838,0.0009,0.0056,0.0006,1.7407,3.8415,5.9179,8.8049,0.2471,3.5407,0.292,6.7832,0.0249,0.9663,3.5988,4.0206,1.5444,6.1768,0.0706,2.9707,1.1212,5.2708,2.0074,3.6932,6.4113,0.0026,0.9248,3.4526,5.9393,0.8886,0.5355,6.2349,5.1055,6.5908,7.8031,0.1598,3.3802,3.5673,4.6983,6.2369,0.1384,3.631,0.7963,7.8745,0.0953,0.1368,0.001,0.0072,0.0008,5.3131,5.5278,4.1159,0.7283,1.7737,5.0461,4.312,0.1003,4.2326,1.1311,5.2581,2.523,4.8053,1.8117,2.4443,2.6608,4.7833,0.5942,4.6051,7.8203,4.1369,0.8338,0.5011,0.0008,0.0197,0.001,0.0021,0.001,0.331,4.1476,1.7482,7.5532,6.8299,0.1637,0.7905,5.4689,7.1017,1.2587,2.7542,0.002,7.0297,9.3082,2.9421,2.2705,2.5625,3.2269,1.4686,2.8998,5.6423,0.0045,2.9664,0.4229,1.7679,0.003,3.6511,0.0041,0.008,10.1946,1.848,2.9406,3.7829,2.7826,4.4981,4.5404,3.1679,0.202,1.723,0.0233,0.3918,0.001,0.0176,0.0016,1.0745]}

The gully was severely hit by a number of bushfires in 1939 that threatened the area, and further destruction was caused by floods in the mid 1970s when the gully ran dry after 3 years on dry. These floods saw the removal of the two small springs that flowed into the gully, this damage was a great worry to the locals.\nSince then the area has suffered less extreme flooding and the two springs re-emerged in 1977. This is significant as these springs were believed to have been a key natural spring feeding the gully. Unfortunately there has been no consistent water flow through these springs since the 1980s. At times they have produced considerable volumes of water, and are a crucial source of drinking water for the local community. The springs also provide for wildlife such as frogs, bats and fish.\nDespite the fact that a large part of the gully has had water through much of the year the stream has become a major concern for the local community given the fact that the stream was not historically associated with any form of water flow.

She moved northward across the southern Gulf of Mexico, northwestern Texas and the western United States and weakened back to a tropical storm by 1200 UTC on September 10, after which it shifted northeastward across Texas, the northern United States and the northern Gulf of Mexico, weakening again to a tropical low pressure system before ending her tropical development.","token_len":288,"entropy":[11.6242,4.1799,7.3941,1.1143,1.4673,4.4148,5.0378,0.2265,0.1429,4.478,10.1033,4.894,1.0359,2.941,3.3058,2.9847,8.2743,3.7016,0.3503,0.2536,2.1917,6.0757,2.909,5.4744,1.1035,8.4164,2.8698,1.6515,1.8185,1.6718,5.2678,4.345,1.8692,3.996,4.0285,3.92,3.7182,5.2724,0.062,0.8827,0.3955,1.4517,0.3328,4.8875,0.0044,6.6413,1.0223,2.4579,5.7072,2.9244,8.089,0.0477,1.0521,0.15,0.6497,5.5434,9.0563,5.573,1.9446,0.8649,1.3131,1.091,11.9048,0.1142,0.0113,6.1606,8.8151,3.341,1.7662,2.4612,4.193,1.8772,5.4877,5.2622,2.3152,2.4171,0.6165,3.1614,0.2198,5.0404,0.009,0.0072,0.8325,0.3328,0.08,6.0372,1.2501,0.2849,4.7623,6.3368,0.9648,0.124,0.1867,4.7675,4.161,2.2279,0.7553,3.2745,5.3055,4.1585,2.8393,0.6553,0.5208,1.5817,1.6326,2.7379,0.3284,2.1151,3.0795,0.8144,4.1967,0.4976,4.5181,2.8418,0.2809,0.0156,2.6152,4.8068,3.5014,0.0011,0.0042,1.767,5.0365,3.0107,3.9657,0.8775,4.9666,2.6611,4.5747,1.1013,6.3442,0.7647,4.2121,0.7501,0.0029,4.3444,3.4121,0.2649,1.9826,2.037,0.2115,2.7798,0.1217,5.1396,0.02,5.794,0.1456,0.0316,3.239,0.2485,0.032,3.0739,6.543,2.3166,5.9742,0.1746,2.7665,5.945,0.4605,1.5388,4.7727,0.0422,0.2711,0.2502,0.9307,0.3112,5.5288,5.2425,1.0681,4.3324,3.0051,2.1385,1.3031,4.66,2.2596,0.4241,2.2739,6.3482,4.7013,3.0594,3.0876,4.8171,0.8392,2.9527,6.5438,6.3536,6.6242,0.4143,8.5496,1.1256,0.0005,3.01,6.2951,0.607,0.0025,0.0,0.0001,2.1018,3.8179,0.2788,0.5403,0.2683,0.9542,3.7241,2.9309,1.3278,3.7174,2.0884,4.7526,6.0009,0.3003,4.7654,7.5608,12.6196,6.4642,2.3823,0.0511,5.8564,7.5809,0.1724,0.471,3.1114,2.383,2.9638,0.1567,4.641,0.2604,3.9965,1.7632,0.211,0.015,1.5412,9.8091,1.866,0.4991,2.2346,3.5929,1.8329,0.002,2.8086,4.8113,5.3074,1.2051,1.505,1.5044,2.007,2.1711,2.7692,0.0366,0.3848,0.3119,0.5457,1.9785,4.6927,0.8437,0.6707,3.6678,1.8582,0.2237,4.0033,3.4419,1.8656,2.4238,4.0818,2.6827,0.0015,0.2764,1.6616,2.9217,2.7067,0.1391,0.0176,1.9236,3.9209,2.6818,1.4298,0.2445,0.4689,7.7973,0.348,4.9979,6.1382,4.7616,4.7599,3.4083,5.188,0.9613]}

He made his debut for the Southport outfit in a 4\u20131 league win over Dagenham & Redbridge on the opening day of the season and scored his first goal for the club the following week in a 2\u20132 draw with Tamworth. He played all of Southern League's remaining fixtures of 2010\u201311, as Southern League Premier Division champions, but finished the season on the bench due to the arrival of a substitute keeper. He rejoined Tamworth for 2011\u201312, and played a handful of matches for them before taking three months off to recover a fractured clavicle that put his season in jeopardy.\nChallinor rejoined Tamworth on a trial basis in July 2012, and on 1 January 2013 he signed a one-year contract to play for the club, but had to sit out his first game for Tamworth due to injury. He did, however, manage to appear in four games for the club in 2013\u201314, but he was one of four players the club tried to sign without success following the retirement of Tony Thompson. He signed a one-year extension to his contract with Tamworth in April 2014, but only appeared sporadically in 2015.","token_len":288,"entropy":[4.9852,7.8656,11.09,2.0928,7.4729,5.003,8.3649,1.7975,1.9922,6.6529,2.3603,1.3997,2.7239,1.7964,3.2356,3.2465,1.8914,3.4029,3.3904,2.1927,1.7975,5.5269,0.3338,2.133,0.7617,8.505,2.168,2.5107,4.5524,0.598,7.7328,2.8485,3.3877,4.0857,3.1229,0.0906,1.1043,1.8702,3.9059,4.7135,5.9859,6.7407,0.5429,5.5527,1.3143,0.0147,0.1175,2.8883,3.0505,1.1569,1.0563,0.7877,1.7969,5.8174,5.1443,2.8451,0.7829,3.1849,1.7315,6.6593,1.1498,7.6431,0.8673,0.2601,5.8738,3.0309,0.0006,5.3813,5.788,0.165,1.8669,3.6939,1.3609,0.1217,0.3484,0.2224,0.9745,2.4702,2.3915,1.723,0.4703,0.7444,1.8282,0.9924,1.393,6.5467,0.1673,1.6108,3.2599,0.7509,1.1168,0.2835,2.2164,0.198,1.4265,9.628,0.0216,1.8494,2.0951,3.5785,4.3997,1.9245,7.0884,0.1135,1.5323,5.4952,2.5525,5.0387,2.7548,3.1637,0.1057,0.7928,4.3294,8.2165,0.0789,3.5973,0.0512,2.4119,1.3984,2.5209,4.0456,1.7966,0.5484,2.4429,1.0894,1.3211,4.7296,0.001,4.0074,5.4341,0.0012,4.4567,6.22,5.263,1.0019,1.8906,5.8536,0.0116,9.045,0.0001,3.486,4.7995,2.8419,0.004,0.7455,2.3803,2.8525,2.3348,5.48,0.0097,2.0648,0.9542,2.6693,2.0805,5.0252,7.2253,2.7795,0.2368,1.5206,2.2817,7.1292,3.8656,6.6172,0.0087,0.0137,3.3312,6.1458,3.6649,2.7137,2.1666,0.758,0.3419,1.0146,17.568,0.0036,0.0022,6.5528,0.0207,4.5604,0.0001,1.656,2.1353,4.9705,2.0002,0.8212,3.5981,1.3387,0.5728,1.5146,5.6877,4.0523,1.7911,0.2147,1.6972,2.2714,1.473,2.3857,0.1007,0.0593,0.6712,3.1711,1.3751,0.8316,1.4986,2.354,2.5965,3.2795,3.7204,0.9304,4.622,0.073,3.5247,1.3633,2.1514,1.7565,7.0105,0.0,2.4418,0.0031,2.8337,0.3561,1.0476,4.5674,2.5597,0.0583,0.0054,4.0025,0.2435,5.8284,0.554,3.3087,1.1739,0.526,0.7922,0.7977,1.7318,1.5449,1.0831,0.0043,0.4997,2.7827,3.4836,1.0247,6.4137,0.1314,3.4306,0.7745,5.9739,0.1889,6.5526,0.0807,0.582,6.6542,1.5608,5.5452,1.2173,7.112,0.0188,6.25,6.1127,1.03,1.8257,3.97,1.3309,1.0673,0.038,0.0362,3.5802,2.6206,2.6566,0.5845,1.8592,1.5816,0.0001,1.2329,3.0932,0.6545,0.341,1.3782,4.0889,3.9053,5.9692,0.0004,0.0002,0.984,5.1952,1.6604]}

That is not the opinion I have, though.\nIt's hard to tell for sure, but I think that it's written by a woman if she is using a male first name and it is her own writing. I don't think that \"Phyllis R.\" is necessarily a male first name -- although it might be a surname. (I would think that most first names are assumed to be male, and in the case of Phyllis, one could reasonably suppose that R. would be a surname.) So if it is her own writing, and not a tribute to a male author to promote his name, she seems to have an unusual talent for telling stories.","token_len":290,"entropy":[8.119,1.9067,7.2394,3.9516,9.1703,0.1209,7.6143,6.5083,13.894,5.9006,5.1301,4.6571,11.6899,5.4684,10.0476,3.4325,8.2219,0.3224,0.0149,9.7936,12.7039,0.0577,0.07,5.1978,3.3177,8.8451,0.4737,3.9931,3.4129,3.3778,4.1144,3.4785,1.4037,9.9432,0.332,4.972,0.0101,2.2424,1.5421,2.2836,9.6144,12.4982,7.5714,7.7445,1.9556,6.2654,7.0961,2.8148,0.8146,3.4005,0.4543,6.7769,9.8221,3.6443,5.1367,5.9632,6.6796,1.7172,2.6374,7.8901,4.5473,1.5716,6.3435,0.4284,2.2202,0.1046,2.5747,2.9877,7.5979,1.388,5.6019,8.8558,10.1874,1.7454,8.8189,8.1128,6.0962,7.8773,4.0487,7.309,4.2511,0.0337,4.1673,10.921,1.8297,4.7108,5.0949,1.0964,6.1835,2.9761,10.292,4.1382,0.0016,2.7513,0.0102,1.0463,0.0236,13.2408,8.6774,11.4785,9.0642,5.8308,5.8459,2.2148,6.1181,0.0382,4.1027,6.2915,2.9287,9.6812,5.912,9.9397,2.1605,0.0831,0.3739,0.4093,7.3625,1.3653,4.8685,4.3631,7.5305,1.4784,3.4552,3.9117,5.6225,2.6229,5.4496,0.8328,0.1253,0.0028,4.0414,4.9029,2.7874,0.494,2.7137,7.5499,2.2194,0.0362,1.5981,1.0434,2.139,6.0162,0.7636,3.3965,4.3246,1.5982,6.6443,2.4357,2.2121,5.6652,3.6967,4.6,1.3687,5.1689,1.8706,2.8601,2.3459,7.6811,3.1087,1.521,2.2614,2.9141,1.0864,2.4105,3.6757,2.4338,4.2837,0.1877,2.55,4.7015,0.2713,1.5947,0.8946,1.37,2.4141,2.2944,2.3748,1.7251,4.3564,0.3662,0.9466,1.3107,7.8423,1.0293,2.0166,6.5406,1.5875,5.3421,7.1028,0.1656,3.2427,3.8967,1.876,4.4476,3.0323,3.6839,0.9862,1.9864,2.6396,0.0008,1.3602,1.6707,5.6596,8.1487,2.0125,0.0131,6.49,5.7676,1.0718,4.2866,1.5528,1.6811,0.3545,0.0312,6.8205,4.6662,1.7902,2.6373,0.462,2.2234,5.6422,2.1336,3.4042,1.8481,3.6134,2.4686,1.0114,5.1374,5.2741,0.1112,1.4344,5.7432,0.631,0.459,1.8176,1.4322,2.167,4.3623,2.5362,0.9882,0.0333,3.1729,0.0059,0.0015,1.6903,5.0064,2.8694,4.742,5.4621,0.3724,5.5251,1.0847,2.2655,0.6503,1.9231,3.3538,1.1444,3.6345,3.1841,2.1296,1.3924,3.2763,1.9404,0.4302,0.38,3.4484,3.306,2.1475,7.0563,0.4266,2.3273,3.1948,2.7196,5.4763,8.0,4.798,5.4724,0.481,3.3955,4.2759,0.2916,1.1147,4.1459,4.8282,4.1518,0.2926,5.5157,0.919,1.5547]}

This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing power, thus she was forced to leave Argentina and move to Paris. In 1957, Eva Peron won the election as vice president of Argentina. This time the votes were cast by the majority of the voting public. Many military leaders refused to recognize her as president.\nThe military opposition to Evita took several dramatic forms. First, when she visited military stronghold Santa Cruz in 1960 it was surrounded by the army and she even had a shootout with soldiers. Later, the military arrested President Peron. Peron was accused of corruption and a few years later, his wife was arrested. She was accused of inciting sedition after a protest march by women in support of Peron. She was charged with inciting sedition and also accused of stealing from the military government. The military government decided to prosecute her but not to hang her on the gallows.\nPeron survived and continued his reigns of prosperity. There was a lot of money, all for that he enjoyed the lifestyle that he had been accustomed to during his time as a military head of state. While he was alive, there was no political opposition to the current president-elect. But the new president did not agree with Peron's policies and tried to change Peron from the government by force.","token_len":290,"entropy":[11.2116,0.2682,10.6576,3.6637,8.2847,3.1014,0.1793,0.0691,5.8458,0.9819,3.9243,1.3276,0.4217,6.7842,2.9206,6.9227,0.201,6.3768,17.5748,8.0155,3.4673,6.5665,1.6891,4.4901,5.9821,6.4406,1.5435,9.3309,2.4609,1.9826,7.2815,2.854,0.0006,1.7144,3.2591,9.2186,4.1233,2.7749,6.1154,2.9706,1.1058,2.1931,0.1301,3.3046,8.7528,2.7429,3.0859,0.3057,4.5353,0.6549,2.9027,3.7131,0.3126,5.5691,6.1625,0.9254,4.8412,0.6454,2.2419,2.3347,1.8863,0.5549,1.4575,1.9135,1.004,3.9112,3.7197,3.1783,5.9402,0.4311,2.5832,1.3334,2.2204,5.3379,0.4051,0.8668,3.6708,2.2291,1.2326,5.5217,3.3223,0.6149,5.1514,0.0914,3.3169,1.5055,1.7027,1.6887,1.6477,2.4497,5.4098,3.9386,7.1217,1.8588,0.5593,0.0006,4.5763,4.919,6.4869,3.0469,0.6428,2.5819,0.4344,4.2038,1.802,5.0082,4.9367,8.9816,6.1627,1.7628,0.9989,4.2258,4.9645,0.2963,8.103,0.177,2.724,3.3472,1.3263,5.9839,6.1453,3.195,1.8506,8.7719,0.226,3.2947,0.8694,3.3483,0.8384,3.0153,0.9652,5.8726,6.3256,3.5364,0.0076,2.5802,4.012,0.0015,0.9931,4.5282,0.106,3.3878,0.8153,4.4601,4.5866,1.6212,0.1079,1.9751,3.5902,1.8523,1.1673,2.0782,1.7938,3.2415,0.6871,4.3571,0.1281,5.2456,7.2758,0.0136,4.642,3.0057,4.0186,5.291,2.2469,4.5787,2.2797,4.2512,0.0066,2.1074,0.0153,0.6248,2.5977,0.4771,4.6318,0.2024,2.433,1.5498,0.003,0.8644,5.0199,3.7197,0.0549,5.6767,2.122,1.1166,0.9711,6.0629,0.5778,2.5849,0.9615,4.1336,4.7983,0.3305,3.3103,0.9014,3.0092,3.7916,2.9578,7.3825,0.1634,3.9836,1.1467,4.1119,0.0029,0.3229,1.3204,4.1896,0.0074,6.4041,2.7575,4.0655,2.8887,4.7363,5.667,3.8411,8.2823,1.6402,5.7806,1.3553,1.063,3.9726,0.1709,5.5136,4.7149,6.4165,5.3921,7.798,5.2709,5.3214,2.2938,5.7672,2.8442,1.2696,1.6274,2.6674,3.5982,0.0165,3.4372,0.1331,2.1219,1.6388,2.3762,1.5844,5.7213,1.1407,0.1596,0.2329,5.2359,1.7625,0.96,4.4729,0.6154,3.9968,0.5804,3.0853,3.6724,2.6719,0.918,3.1056,5.0041,1.6276,6.5858,0.0336,0.9445,4.9277,2.5904,5.2226,0.8356,3.5372,0.5334,4.6639,0.288,3.1669,0.0026,1.0254,2.1005,0.9656,4.0938,0.1053,3.8103,3.9482,0.0044,4.3841,2.2111,5.4538,5.3147,2.5088,0.2954]}

Like her previous two singles, the lyricism and subject matter of the song are fairly serious, but it is the voice of Kelly that immediately drew my greatest attention.\nI have to admit to having mixed emotions about this album. I love Kelly's voice and have watched much of her show but I feel like she has not quite matured as an artist compared to the music she has made before ( if I say so myself ).\nAll I hear is some very sad and angry notes, which are also very strong, but I also miss Kelly's original voice.

'' ( catechism page 1615)\nFrom this the faithful have been taught that the life of a human embryo has the sacred character, and cannot be dealt with humanely, as if it were no more than an experimental dish that can be experimented on by the scientist. The Catechism further states : `` In the human body, therefore, man must regard all life from the beginning to the end as the work of the Creator and has no right to treat any human being as a thing. It is his duty to make every effort to preserve it in its inviolability, in its dignity and in all its natural and spiritual powers.\nOne cannot explain the death of innocent human embryos and the killing of innocent human babies on the grounds that it gives them the opportunity for development and life. The truth is that the human embryo in itself has no value. It is simply a tiny form, the result of millions of years of evolution and an unfortunate accident. Its purpose is to give rise to a fully formed human being through the process of fertilization and gestation in the womb, and not to provide for their own development. These unfortunate circumstances have nothing to do with the inherent character of the human embryo which is inviolable.","token_len":290,"entropy":[6.854,5.4096,0.0288,4.3143,5.7676,9.8368,10.3316,2.135,0.7658,4.5219,5.3726,6.976,1.8302,1.4122,1.6626,7.4967,1.0193,6.159,3.4666,0.1664,1.7819,1.8542,4.6939,6.4993,6.445,2.2755,3.6349,5.726,3.4965,0.3606,1.6193,2.0601,2.1098,2.8907,1.3899,5.8283,5.5035,3.408,2.5428,2.3199,0.8454,6.1912,2.3082,7.6258,1.479,0.0489,7.3707,4.6796,6.6995,1.3562,1.3031,6.5287,1.8176,3.3783,7.2378,3.6448,2.3385,2.5201,0.8119,1.4834,3.8843,0.3627,2.5768,2.4556,8.1616,3.5641,2.9882,6.4723,2.3792,2.4446,1.671,6.4656,0.1966,9.3322,0.0384,9.3176,0.0038,2.4323,2.8092,3.2923,0.8703,0.2371,6.5775,1.0299,0.4367,1.7711,7.3375,7.234,3.4826,3.0912,0.4281,7.1204,1.4401,1.993,1.6283,5.525,0.7075,2.0346,2.9136,0.0006,0.0023,2.4409,0.5167,1.0356,1.0732,3.379,1.4928,3.195,2.814,1.8449,5.2126,0.0218,5.0718,3.362,6.7484,3.4062,2.9652,5.58,1.6863,0.3728,3.1974,1.6231,0.2065,0.706,2.7101,2.9658,0.0577,1.6251,0.4865,1.7192,5.3478,1.5068,2.8555,0.1562,4.7035,2.585,2.3717,1.4562,0.5433,1.5203,5.3631,3.5008,2.9049,0.4335,3.8325,1.9586,0.4045,3.1004,2.6302,2.9375,0.3606,2.7858,2.7958,2.3292,1.9792,10.8037,0.0207,1.0819,1.6556,3.207,1.3058,3.5954,0.9028,0.4809,4.7221,0.3188,3.9675,2.3625,2.7791,5.1304,1.0415,4.2434,5.8531,3.6435,6.0786,1.3344,6.0014,0.2574,7.595,2.0263,4.3472,4.1357,1.3438,5.2715,0.1762,2.2626,0.7513,3.4524,4.3353,0.5532,2.165,0.3596,2.3387,6.4485,2.1379,2.11,4.876,2.3615,5.9435,1.8894,4.0981,0.8543,1.9672,5.3194,0.3563,0.3477,1.648,2.2639,1.0937,4.3101,3.1905,2.5315,0.6671,4.7787,1.9306,1.1767,0.6055,4.2647,0.8928,6.546,6.0098,2.5189,3.652,2.1215,0.0181,6.3985,0.1194,0.8337,0.1445,1.8687,1.8105,4.8385,4.9898,1.3409,0.9722,3.9861,4.6995,0.5213,0.7336,3.5102,2.4148,0.0433,2.1494,7.1351,2.121,1.1434,0.512,5.85,0.9873,3.3214,0.0281,4.7828,0.0612,1.4137,5.6972,4.2873,1.2661,1.0506,1.8964,1.4122,4.366,0.8207,4.1356,2.0002,6.6433,4.2034,1.1901,1.0069,5.5318,6.5382,3.3409,2.3378,4.2612,0.1963,0.0221,0.0056,0.9044,6.765,4.3476,0.1441,0.7231,0.4067,0.9545,5.0545,1.0428,9.5717,0.0097,0.1467,1.6053]}

Radiation burns generally are not caused by the act of radiating the skin. Instead, burns may come from a high level of exposure to a radiation for a short time duration, for example, exposure to gamma radiation from an x-ray machine. A dose of radiation that is safe for immediate exposure may cause skin burns if extended or repeated exposure occurs over a longer time.\nRadiation burns are more severe than sunburns. Even if radiation burns are not life threatening, the prolonged skin damage may impair the person's ability to work or socialize. Persons with radiation burns often require prompt treatment to reduce the severity of the burns and to promote full recovery. If radiation burns are left untreated, they become more severe as the time after treatment increases.\nSunburns are caused by exposure to the ultraviolet light from the sun. People with red skin or light hair, who spend time outdoors, are especially at risk for sunburns. Sunburns that occur on the face, hands, neck and shoulders are more severe than sunburns on other parts of the skin. Sunburns increase the risk or skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) and keratinizing carcinoma (KC).","token_len":290,"entropy":[8.6201,8.2652,5.2526,1.1518,2.7204,0.0585,11.3391,1.5134,0.1915,3.4113,1.6804,2.3179,10.9884,0.0791,2.2363,2.4478,0.5792,2.2174,7.536,0.0064,4.2478,1.8085,8.7542,5.4882,3.5706,1.2566,3.2763,6.0168,0.4278,0.1526,0.96,0.9247,0.0033,0.5276,4.7499,5.2759,2.6796,1.976,4.7219,2.8033,7.1744,0.0663,0.8914,3.0718,3.6262,2.9239,5.0051,2.6095,2.3669,2.4111,0.026,3.0545,6.6583,0.075,4.0754,0.0825,3.5346,6.1963,1.7777,4.1408,0.0837,5.0107,1.7737,5.3338,0.2705,2.6232,6.2415,1.9635,0.0518,2.1189,0.5627,2.5327,3.4939,7.0164,2.1042,1.4531,0.9141,4.7776,1.7448,5.3912,0.2807,1.088,5.9023,0.3586,4.3547,1.6323,3.149,3.2309,5.1808,0.0182,0.0248,3.9059,1.4157,3.6237,4.1567,0.578,1.0964,2.4189,0.9275,6.9182,1.2101,6.8217,2.5507,2.562,3.1488,3.9304,3.2241,3.9817,7.9746,3.803,3.0691,0.3164,3.8467,3.1603,0.5902,2.2172,1.5651,2.5823,1.8403,18.9913,0.0108,1.6027,1.4859,3.0325,3.4183,1.6612,5.9824,0.0693,0.3088,1.5474,5.466,1.2805,3.9888,0.3665,0.6572,1.7124,4.913,0.1634,0.2361,2.4239,6.9093,5.329,2.971,1.3791,5.0643,1.3039,4.3597,0.0263,0.2062,0.0055,4.7572,1.9169,4.1303,0.156,0.9826,6.7615,1.0079,3.4019,0.1326,3.085,3.7282,8.625,2.1339,2.2776,2.443,1.0678,2.6287,0.184,0.7752,1.2468,1.7909,1.5404,6.2184,6.2501,0.5444,0.3698,4.0475,2.3607,0.0679,0.657,7.093,0.1817,0.4088,1.718,5.5252,1.3651,1.4395,2.8873,1.0048,4.4119,6.7836,3.9034,2.3764,0.2869,0.8703,6.1065,0.0639,0.293,1.5555,2.3654,0.1594,4.6528,0.0798,2.9289,2.5914,1.6219,2.3159,1.1719,0.2065,0.8865,5.3295,0.8303,6.0601,2.4268,3.0937,3.4688,4.7041,3.059,3.1198,6.6732,3.4068,1.0365,0.9556,1.9195,3.7064,1.1938,0.1047,0.874,0.9415,0.0024,0.0792,0.5076,2.4077,0.013,0.0661,4.2395,0.9059,3.5083,1.1447,2.6023,1.0611,3.6227,0.923,2.4348,1.3961,2.8773,0.9486,1.7181,4.3298,0.6714,1.3715,0.0061,0.0071,3.5291,5.1405,0.7903,0.0021,0.0258,6.5046,0.4679,2.055,0.0073,0.056,6.9038,1.1018,0.3524,7.9219,8.3902,5.7467,3.4349,0.0018,7.7382,0.0186,0.0836,0.0262,0.0079,2.3492,6.1835,0.2364,1.168,0.5664,5.2424,4.4961,6.2539,3.7534,0.0189,0.1511,8.3275,1.0503]}

The original construction consisted of blasting from Bjor\u00f8y, to the south of the site, to create the voids that were filled with crushed stone. In July 1994, an additional 100,000 m3 of crushed stone was blasted. In September 1994, more than 4.7 million m3 rock was crushed and in January 1995 the excavation had pushed to the northwest on the western side of the island, reaching a depth of about 20 m. On September 20, 1995 the tunnel was opened to the traffic.\n\nThe Toll Gate\n\nThe first Toll Gate in the Tunnel was built in March 1996. In order to reduce passenger movement across the island during the holiday season of 1996\u201397, a second Toll Gate was constructed in October 1997 and the second in December 1998. The third Toll Gate was built in June 2014. In October 2016, the fourth Toll Gate was added.\nIn August 2002, it was discovered that the tunnel contained toxic air trapped in the rocks along the tunnel's floor that might cause a serious effect on human health. After extensive testing, the results indicated that the concentration of arsenic, a heavy metal released by the rock, was within normal values. In March 2011, two additional testing results were published, one showing a decreased level of arsenic, but other than that, the results were negative.","token_len":292,"entropy":[8.9746,0.4965,1.1472,5.8951,5.8811,2.035,5.8312,2.3668,5.0401,1.2507,2.7599,1.1453,5.3912,3.9906,6.8838,0.0227,2.2076,1.843,0.2952,3.7748,2.0714,3.5067,3.5759,2.4258,0.3346,1.6473,3.6398,3.652,5.605,0.0422,8.7938,4.7024,14.0187,3.2531,5.9736,1.6613,3.0104,5.1862,1.3419,1.7233,0.8287,1.1124,3.6197,0.6473,2.5868,2.8206,1.4523,8.9956,2.6957,2.1907,3.121,6.4612,1.0788,6.8451,3.766,0.8343,3.3247,4.1206,2.0822,0.3553,3.9379,3.0384,5.3724,2.3412,0.0035,6.0979,0.8078,0.4331,5.4876,0.8094,0.4195,6.1209,3.175,2.5843,2.4612,1.2487,0.2194,4.7819,0.3998,4.0606,2.1703,2.9264,0.1667,1.3961,0.0142,11.5389,0.4786,4.1249,2.2652,4.8357,2.9356,0.189,2.0862,3.6982,5.3701,7.8232,3.6234,1.5997,5.411,6.2677,0.947,4.7657,1.1617,0.1525,0.3139,5.1808,2.0757,4.8841,1.4435,0.7093,0.0332,2.7892,3.6104,1.7605,0.5012,3.8016,5.2151,3.5818,0.3773,0.7247,2.4276,2.4795,1.1314,1.8649,1.6862,1.0158,6.0402,1.7426,1.6672,0.0022,1.4647,10.0091,6.105,2.039,0.0002,1.1132,3.5907,6.1621,0.0944,3.5933,1.7172,7.5566,0.9554,1.4472,0.8421,4.6532,3.1212,1.092,3.1342,4.8012,0.0502,4.9164,7.5871,4.7016,4.576,0.1138,1.5768,4.2702,0.6612,5.8819,0.2047,4.908,3.0878,4.0959,0.8959,0.2413,2.7968,4.2666,1.6907,0.0097,0.2695,1.0825,1.1251,2.6179,1.6291,3.398,2.4267,3.0068,2.0762,1.91,0.5745,0.1685,1.0918,3.3156,0.2911,0.0036,0.6845,1.3546,0.4337,2.6786,7.8866,0.8225,2.2195,2.8466,1.7193,0.2956,0.7243,4.1776,0.2698,0.0023,0.3154,4.687,1.8203,0.9167,17.7286,3.3735,6.8346,0.3094,5.2252,0.1696,4.2997,0.1881,0.8982,2.7277,5.6786,6.7343,5.5345,5.2341,0.6733,0.7648,5.4385,5.825,0.5379,3.7035,1.116,6.8712,4.2955,4.9529,2.0936,2.6318,3.8987,5.9174,0.342,4.2354,0.3155,0.3726,4.692,3.8076,1.547,0.6643,1.0052,4.1891,3.0683,0.1556,0.543,7.8804,0.1012,4.8845,2.5066,2.4364,3.9089,0.2809,6.3573,1.2104,1.079,6.522,1.0721,0.6307,5.2138,3.6068,6.6685,0.905,2.2931,3.0084,3.6518,0.1308,4.9875,3.1031,5.6616,3.1962,0.5896,1.7642,2.0112,2.5779,2.5033,1.7389,6.5348,2.0021,0.0377,1.1441,1.5491,4.335,5.6409,5.9781,0.462,0.3026,1.201,2.0772,1.395,4.1293,0.1614]}
{"prompt":"The 1st century AD Book of Acts refers to Azotus as the place in which Philip the Evangelist reappeared after he converted the Ethiopian eunuch to Christianity .

Philip preached the gospel throughout the area, and he and the followers built their first church on location.\nIt is possible that Philip's wife and their children came from Azotus, although they may have arrived later after Philip (or perhaps one of his disciples) died. The family name of the Philip mentioned in the Bible is Paul, which is believed to be the name of the Philip mentioned as an Ethiopian eunuch by the 1st-century church tradition. The name Azotus, which is used only once in the Bible, has no known historical connections to Azotus of Ethiopia as it was then known around the 4th century. Although Azotus is not mentioned in any historical records, it has been suggested by scholars that it is related to the town of Azoth in ancient Israel.\n\nModern Azotus\n\nThere were only eight Azotists in ancient Azotus: two of them were women, whereas men numbered three. The three men were considered the most learned of the village and lived out their lives there (see Acts 19:10\u201311; Acts 19:15\u201322). Their names were Demas, Demetrius, and Dionysius \u2013 all three died as martyrs in Jerusalem during the early fifth century.","token_len":292,"entropy":[6.5285,1.6708,5.8391,2.1959,9.2934,0.2628,4.4742,6.1654,0.0958,9.6032,9.531,1.8434,1.3958,1.6761,8.9613,3.277,1.2311,7.579,2.1793,5.7388,0.0039,9.6896,0.5616,3.4381,2.2415,6.373,2.7798,6.6123,8.4079,0.3019,0.0728,2.1255,0.3616,0.588,4.4081,7.2482,1.7199,1.5436,5.1443,1.0662,5.2333,1.6002,1.7315,2.5567,5.6951,2.418,4.8013,6.1456,4.3103,3.8122,1.3034,2.5504,10.0675,1.5642,1.4367,8.9465,0.6859,3.2389,0.2891,2.0695,1.9818,6.0129,2.9301,4.1942,1.9772,4.4869,1.0991,3.6313,0.0272,0.026,1.3824,3.6758,2.9609,2.6965,0.33,3.3119,4.6453,5.2552,1.5797,7.2477,1.8549,2.8503,5.2301,0.1837,0.5963,3.1894,0.5222,3.711,0.6232,2.0651,5.6506,3.7048,1.5073,1.0123,7.6449,6.2154,0.6968,0.5968,3.1909,1.0277,7.4603,1.8067,2.2755,1.2634,5.6914,0.0635,1.0444,1.3554,1.4928,0.1998,0.9534,8.0922,2.2204,5.5834,3.4003,4.7537,1.3264,0.0012,0.0017,3.475,1.1943,5.1242,0.0106,3.7877,0.0344,7.1732,7.8941,0.3149,2.2763,2.5128,5.0789,0.0878,0.0259,2.6613,1.6219,1.136,3.3732,5.1524,3.914,0.6589,0.432,0.6969,0.2351,3.1655,2.2728,5.1745,2.732,6.0706,0.863,2.3204,0.0218,0.0111,6.353,3.2547,5.2493,1.7132,1.7574,6.045,0.804,6.6435,0.4865,7.1118,0.0208,0.2122,1.8523,5.4294,2.8405,0.0094,0.0169,1.1256,2.3855,1.1589,0.4775,2.4914,4.3009,2.3732,0.6381,1.0279,3.1396,0.4532,1.9179,2.4007,1.8147,0.2944,1.4102,1.7294,3.0604,0.1022,0.8325,5.5074,0.2363,4.4463,4.9677,2.6544,4.9195,3.2259,0.9853,0.9008,7.9748,6.7211,5.1546,0.3551,0.0678,1.7475,0.0004,3.7787,3.2908,4.3369,4.9919,1.591,0.1689,9.2026,0.8362,3.4532,3.2269,0.9495,0.0386,3.138,3.928,1.8041,0.5552,0.7851,5.0625,1.2038,7.9412,7.0425,5.6774,3.4225,0.7797,1.4854,4.0337,2.8196,1.2284,5.5455,2.0367,2.3831,7.0393,1.5967,0.3593,7.7886,3.2897,4.317,5.4941,1.2828,0.825,4.3094,4.5388,2.8707,6.5882,4.1902,0.1253,3.4458,3.02,0.7741,1.9071,1.5396,2.1267,0.006,2.8365,0.6028,4.2398,0.8242,3.7798,3.5546,1.3178,8.8286,4.8089,0.7423,4.015,3.6643,0.1724,0.2815,1.2377,6.085,0.1002,1.514,7.2029,1.7027,4.536,6.9091,3.8368,2.8613,0.0085,1.7454,5.7609,3.1445,0.3164,5.0559,5.7033,0.0353,2.07]}

His position was supported by former student and former Senator Tom Udall.\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, MSU had the lowest average grade point average for its graduates among 50 research universities in the United States.","token_len":295,"entropy":[3.4462,5.4092,5.6027,3.6494,6.1224,11.5555,6.2579,4.588,11.9189,12.8074,12.1926,2.4578,4.5176,6.9498,8.3533,3.8093,5.5328,5.0098,0.2873,0.1228,3.0579,5.1263,0.0809,2.9299,4.1528,0.4116,3.7585,4.0607,0.1199,1.2987,1.7031,10.772,3.7484,0.0023,0.079,0.2918,4.795,4.5802,2.4293,0.0292,0.1556,1.0602,0.0668,2.1211,1.179,1.7616,2.9704,0.1092,1.2265,0.0013,1.9439,2.4966,1.9913,5.0775,1.8724,6.6785,10.7535,0.0252,7.5341,5.1083,0.0581,0.7515,8.8541,4.4756,7.5672,0.5004,0.2571,3.9914,3.8803,2.2515,1.9539,1.3804,0.0013,6.8105,2.6733,5.9841,0.0776,0.9884,4.0832,0.0339,4.7639,5.9034,0.0307,0.0237,1.6661,6.0466,0.0182,0.2128,4.0583,5.8165,5.7821,0.1612,0.1931,0.5636,1.4767,2.1298,1.8299,7.1989,5.3253,7.4294,1.3107,1.032,3.2114,2.8535,2.8243,5.2191,2.5395,2.2372,0.5924,0.0016,5.153,4.4059,0.1312,1.8337,2.818,0.0023,0.4324,3.6415,4.8027,0.3755,1.0102,6.0045,3.6923,3.1166,0.0027,2.207,2.3816,5.3858,0.0008,4.3682,4.0001,9.2621,0.7864,0.9078,3.3439,1.8362,0.3979,3.2675,1.9111,1.9991,1.7417,1.0774,1.0598,8.0155,3.6736,0.0003,2.79,6.3312,2.4649,6.2444,0.2559,0.2407,1.2848,7.3217,2.3967,0.6682,1.3581,6.4505,5.1591,1.7264,7.2162,6.1945,2.4627,7.0508,8.6084,0.7695,7.153,3.6519,7.7741,2.4511,0.4376,4.4104,3.2064,3.3229,0.2103,3.003,0.1876,1.564,6.0723,0.343,3.6582,0.2868,0.0102,0.8864,1.6784,4.3716,0.1862,3.6046,1.6766,6.1664,7.3914,0.0135,0.374,0.8638,6.1701,2.222,2.0306,0.5044,4.2735,0.1807,5.6081,1.443,5.5236,1.1649,1.9142,1.9236,0.0019,0.3898,3.7943,0.0028,5.2295,6.2142,6.2506,4.7314,3.4106,0.5736,3.1327,1.6949,1.7241,0.7924,1.2543,2.9217,2.5554,1.9666,1.817,6.3714,1.6646,0.7911,0.1009,0.4501,2.1071,3.0907,3.1364,4.9969,1.411,1.2142,2.2657,0.5274,0.2887,4.6369,0.5303,4.8741,4.8994,1.7224,4.1712,0.1041,3.8468,4.6634,3.137,2.6839,7.2894,4.5166,2.5088,0.0005,2.3624,0.9129,19.6041,0.0029,2.0921,3.7494,2.3377,0.8644,0.7091,5.3542,0.0627,9.0232,1.2485,2.1143,0.6845,1.9218,2.3392,0.5942,0.5606,3.0159,0.0011,4.4392,1.1001,2.4563,3.3121,6.2568,1.0981,0.1871,2.0391,4.0282,5.412,3.5903,5.2187,6.5104,1.1241,1.9635,0.3376,1.7947,0.004,0.6618]}

He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the mental images one possesses.\nHe had a great enthusiasm towards his work and the first year he passed the exam he was so unlucky that none of his images or compositions were awarded.\nOne of his most notable works is an equestrian statue of Sir Thomas Seymour (1565-1618), who had been a member of the court of James I. In 1608 he went to the wars with the Turkish Empire. There he met the king, who was killed. Seymour was the only surviving member of this small group. To mourn the king he painted a portrait of himself in his last suit, which would go on to win a gold medal at the Academy in 1639.\nThe portrait is now at the National Gallery, London. Bates was aware from the beginning of the problem of composition. He was a man of principle, yet he could not resist submitting to the advice of his students. He would seek examples of good technique and style and then offer advice on how to combine the styles together into an individual work. The way he combined styles of the past in his own works is a subject which can still be discussed without any sign of any progress towards getting a definite consensus.

The second begins with the second bees hatching a day later in the same nest.

Bee Movie is a metaphorical way of dealing with scientific issues as it depicts the behaviour and actions of real bees in a movie-like manner.","token_len":296,"entropy":[7.0236,3.8476,2.3283,2.9096,7.8173,5.3458,1.7142,5.8948,1.0861,2.1305,2.7188,0.0008,1.7006,8.5156,7.6376,3.312,7.0881,5.3813,4.8434,0.738,3.4923,1.6549,14.8346,10.2687,4.2955,6.5526,7.0824,1.0647,9.3845,3.9772,7.7149,0.3964,1.5918,12.8289,2.3317,2.8065,5.7398,1.4763,4.5677,7.7157,2.4998,2.2903,8.6352,0.568,1.5567,4.3521,4.8283,2.9895,3.2617,1.1499,1.6827,11.0398,8.6159,0.5169,3.1746,1.7978,0.2804,2.4835,0.5983,2.6106,3.7292,2.7458,2.6387,5.4117,0.4999,7.3568,1.5614,10.2138,1.8369,1.2581,4.0296,3.051,0.7341,1.8191,2.6893,0.8395,2.3048,3.2453,1.2215,3.6712,3.201,5.8379,0.3806,1.304,13.9121,0.3475,0.127,9.6656,1.3737,7.9901,0.8346,1.5268,2.2759,1.1015,2.0505,4.0103,3.051,4.881,0.3837,2.301,2.6755,4.6598,3.6526,11.3927,4.8104,3.6658,0.8821,7.8247,4.5863,3.9811,4.4364,1.4549,3.6889,0.0666,3.5543,0.8048,2.6081,6.81,3.2302,5.1342,2.4357,4.6407,2.8955,6.2737,0.8308,6.7923,2.4013,2.331,3.0479,7.7124,7.1599,1.6604,2.7153,1.1418,4.2602,5.4165,10.8888,12.9499,0.8993,3.1646,1.8444,6.1936,5.8353,4.1779,4.7888,0.9778,2.106,4.8693,1.5833,1.8154,0.7305,5.9318,7.5734,2.6191,5.3749,0.1357,0.9824,5.3546,0.2438,1.7354,3.3107,3.62,0.1198,3.7105,3.5489,0.0523,4.1839,3.0223,0.5267,4.9546,0.5805,3.7643,0.914,0.7929,6.2984,1.9317,1.5394,4.3501,3.1673,7.441,4.5584,1.6394,2.9776,2.5489,1.7385,1.7968,2.7674,4.217,0.3727,0.4864,4.8367,2.5068,1.5534,1.659,3.6102,3.3267,4.6635,0.6826,0.5148,3.4928,4.7663,2.4961,4.3139,6.3227,3.143,2.1671,1.0722,1.1705,3.977,2.3156,0.8733,3.3274,3.4485,5.4237,0.0193,5.7979,8.1169,1.1703,3.3499,0.6776,1.3151,5.243,0.6662,6.1543,3.0514,2.0667,3.0514,2.9428,0.6618,1.9464,4.6207,3.6297,1.0009,1.2237,3.904,2.4976,7.7982,3.5459,5.5894,5.1713,3.552,2.0677,4.1684,10.2309,4.6161,0.0331,1.2226,5.6483,3.8992,0.0176,0.9268,5.2584,0.5659,5.7335,0.0501,0.5844,2.1539,1.4628,2.7778,2.2126,2.8852,5.5408,0.62,5.7244,5.7375,1.7209,5.183,3.757,2.5551,1.6809,8.7381,0.0858,7.1565,0.4413,4.9416,0.006,7.167,1.8052,4.1783,2.0201,4.0012,1.0805,7.3052,2.1891,5.145,0.0449,6.8341,1.0998,2.4336,2.0534,6.2981,4.4271,0.4757,2.2111,0.2629]}

Before a highway was built connecting Yuma to Tucson in 1922, Route 27 was the only highway between Yuma and Tucson and did not have regular maintenance. \nThe San Carlos Mountains were once a major attraction for California tourists. By 1940, when most tourists traveled up via the San Gabriel Mountains, the route up the San Bernardino Mountains had become generally obsolete for people using U.S. highways. In 1940 Route 27 was reconstructed to cut through the San Bernardino Mountains, bypassing El Centro by following Route 12 through Banning Pass. Today the entire San Bernardino Mountains area is part of Route 27.\nThe Route 27 was built on the former C & E railroad line. Some remnants of the original railway are visible in the lower San Bernardino Mountains, adjacent to the road. During construction the line had to be levelled and widened from 12 feet to 15 feet (3.7\u00a0m to 4.6\u00a0m). The line was rebuilt in sections with new gauge and standard railroad rails instead of the narrow-gauge lines used until the 1940s and 1950s. In addition the track bed was widened to permit the highway to run along the tracks instead of across them as seen before.\nAlmost fifty miles (80\u00a0km) of the Route 27 is still in use for State Route 15.","token_len":297,"entropy":[7.7569,5.9083,5.5867,1.3153,0.7703,4.8714,5.2263,0.446,1.0306,8.0425,6.4894,5.1466,1.8113,1.2028,4.9565,3.1462,0.0015,1.4507,2.0979,6.104,6.0521,0.6485,0.3647,2.9878,2.4956,0.2577,0.0096,0.1032,5.7975,1.5068,2.5303,4.261,0.255,7.3042,5.6798,5.4058,0.9977,1.0476,6.0382,3.0287,0.0302,1.5472,4.0438,1.7321,3.8332,0.2253,3.9127,1.9092,0.3203,2.6255,1.0968,2.3624,3.824,1.4699,0.0105,0.0347,0.4573,3.9797,5.6353,0.0196,1.3999,7.0045,3.7427,0.823,9.5217,5.8286,3.5369,4.9748,4.7799,4.4554,1.2592,4.0626,1.7959,2.9655,4.9769,0.6233,6.5052,3.1972,1.3278,5.0251,4.8214,0.2061,4.5315,4.6688,3.2401,3.8863,5.372,8.4764,1.3515,2.154,3.9903,0.1926,0.4467,1.2227,5.5949,7.016,2.2143,2.2124,3.4371,0.513,1.7836,1.353,8.7978,5.8176,4.3345,4.3486,4.8169,5.8514,0.2814,0.0102,0.0843,3.3912,0.3929,2.4332,3.5921,6.5068,0.6999,0.5861,6.3529,2.1653,6.3036,0.7807,0.6743,1.8412,0.8215,0.113,1.8092,4.7536,0.4054,5.0942,1.2879,0.0128,4.7799,5.9275,2.1954,3.5042,3.3304,9.7015,2.6907,5.7005,0.996,4.8484,2.0575,3.7482,2.1727,0.1879,0.3197,5.7289,0.5061,3.6667,0.0026,4.065,0.634,0.6367,0.9039,1.8898,3.4733,1.4486,5.0404,2.2281,2.3152,1.2058,3.8555,6.1642,9.813,2.4942,2.7736,2.2495,2.2867,6.5117,6.7871,0.1267,0.46,2.2449,4.3734,3.6293,2.2674,1.5319,0.444,5.2968,6.3315,0.3976,0.1234,2.32,7.2385,0.1224,0.8577,4.7521,1.4151,5.4133,2.9872,2.0733,3.6087,3.4783,1.5255,0.4996,7.7794,0.0037,2.2148,5.0966,4.5287,4.8412,2.9412,0.4141,2.7428,0.0702,3.5412,3.1772,0.9765,3.0439,9.9706,1.3359,5.1353,1.2424,0.3339,2.2883,0.949,0.0363,1.3104,1.2372,3.4493,0.8886,4.4302,1.4617,8.817,3.0636,2.5883,6.857,2.494,8.178,4.7015,5.4811,6.7609,0.0575,1.2644,6.5139,4.3619,3.1429,0.022,0.0602,4.0612,1.7891,5.4558,1.3872,3.1111,0.2962,3.8207,0.7207,0.0082,0.1467,3.1239,2.6739,2.9786,4.0008,8.8273,1.0564,2.2093,1.1065,5.3446,2.2017,6.4978,0.5596,2.8655,2.859,0.7409,5.9029,4.0646,0.016,4.841,1.1376,4.9193,6.3437,5.9624,0.7115,1.542,8.1435,6.1237,1.919,3.4748,1.6847,4.7176,0.8349,0.0379,0.4128,0.9206,3.4037,0.122,3.2269,2.928,2.5732,0.6738,4.9823,7.6107,0.8131,6.8898,0.9075]}

Some critics applauded the film, while others criticized it for being generic and lacking imagination.

Each section is suspended by cables and can be locked either open in a station for boarding, or closed in the carriage for boarding and service.\n\nLuggage\n\nLuggage is carried on an overhead rack, similar to most British railways, but with some exceptions. The main items of luggage are carried in luggage compartments: the smaller sized items (items smaller than 90 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 25 cm) can be carried in a top luggage locker; larger items normally taken on board the train and must be carried in luggage compartment. It is possible to attach the item to the roof of the carriage, but the passengers must be in attendance. In addition to luggage compartments, it is also possible to carry additional items on luggage racks.\n\nCarriages\n\nThere are five car classes, numbered 1 to 5, with class-2 and 3 carriages having private parlour compartments for up to six passengers.\n\nCarriages and carriages\n\nAlthough most carriages (excluding compartments) are normally opened in both direction, a number of carriages are only open one-way.

The increased production of sebum can lead to accumulation of dirt and grime in the pores of the skin. This can allow infection in the skin to occur leading to a break out and resulting in acne. Sebum can also break down and clog these pores and lead to acne. Although there are many treatment options available, the underlying causes of the aetion may need addressing. The doctor will ask you certain questions to help establish a diagnosis. A treatment plan is then prepared.\nOnce a patient has been diagnosed as suffering from acne, the doctor will use certain techniques to deal with the aetion. The treatments are designed to clear up the break ups in the skin, and to reduce the sebum production. In most cases, treating the aetion results in very few side effects, although there are some which may be caused by the treatment that should be carefully managed.\nThere are many options available for treating acne. The methods chosen can vary depending on what the aetion is. The most common aetions are small comedones and large break ups. These are the types of aetion that are found on the face and skin area that is closest to skin. There are also many skin treatments available which do not only deal with the aetion, but also help improve the appearance of the skin.","token_len":299,"entropy":[7.1201,3.6412,1.7734,4.41,3.3258,3.6287,2.8853,3.6668,4.1848,5.088,4.4346,5.2051,1.8672,1.502,2.1477,4.2093,0.0253,6.7836,0.1008,3.432,1.6735,6.3531,0.0303,5.0746,1.044,5.1017,0.0042,4.318,4.1896,0.6621,2.6863,5.6382,1.2281,0.1541,0.0813,0.0044,2.609,2.276,0.0145,8.3776,0.0577,7.3208,0.9977,6.6069,0.018,1.8611,0.3494,4.4053,0.7789,0.2958,0.841,1.0313,2.8671,1.3932,7.4163,7.0705,3.4299,0.2975,1.1013,2.43,2.9652,8.1358,0.0165,2.6407,6.7124,4.6246,2.6934,6.5585,0.2326,3.5988,0.3527,2.7258,0.198,1.4062,0.6587,6.4796,0.3714,1.8544,5.9946,0.0547,9.3935,0.0391,2.123,2.3585,0.0136,2.551,0.5081,4.809,2.4981,0.8814,1.7953,5.5848,0.104,0.9868,1.0474,1.8952,6.5313,1.3518,0.4139,3.4779,8.3809,4.286,11.4156,3.8746,6.1991,6.7816,0.5386,2.9392,7.2851,2.2207,4.1517,1.3739,9.9443,0.2866,1.6034,1.5601,6.7121,1.8165,2.1689,1.3663,4.4611,4.2019,1.075,1.7067,6.1203,4.1077,2.1907,1.5921,12.4987,1.8884,1.7752,0.7526,0.9987,1.2251,4.0996,5.6352,0.0981,1.11,0.5388,1.7014,0.9868,0.4311,5.253,5.9759,3.0108,0.2584,5.1175,0.005,0.6433,4.8098,0.0083,0.1872,0.5746,1.9794,4.084,1.7766,4.1399,0.1619,6.6401,2.254,0.7512,7.9451,9.1248,2.6558,0.2618,0.4325,1.8705,1.8543,1.9574,2.6661,0.5636,4.3057,0.047,0.6394,0.8847,3.8088,3.5074,0.1726,0.4687,6.1055,1.4337,1.2217,0.0016,0.0672,5.6298,0.0033,5.7247,4.0876,3.6704,0.0433,1.6991,3.326,2.642,1.1952,0.7056,4.9131,0.6284,1.213,4.0504,0.1039,1.7625,1.6965,5.7875,4.5476,0.2767,4.7354,4.1026,0.3579,1.3037,3.9668,0.3186,1.8861,3.7718,0.6552,1.4439,1.1428,0.3136,0.9463,2.0064,6.121,5.0527,2.3822,2.8993,2.1341,0.0463,3.5182,1.966,2.8083,0.002,0.0305,0.7,1.6345,2.0624,1.3671,0.5534,6.5448,0.0098,0.7473,0.7501,6.9348,5.6855,0.083,3.2358,5.7848,6.5799,0.2259,0.6067,1.6351,1.3427,3.1501,4.3957,0.7591,2.3624,0.0163,4.2956,0.562,1.4456,4.4983,3.0105,1.1242,3.0112,1.2061,3.1585,5.1901,2.7251,4.0512,8.0862,0.0213,5.1298,1.2201,3.6289,0.3125,1.057,2.253,3.647,1.7402,1.9288,2.6733,4.281,0.3216,4.2181,4.4027,0.0135,1.3058,1.2071,0.0005,0.1165,0.9309,0.032,0.5222,3.598,4.5534,0.5337,1.9516,0.2212,0.5614,1.1889,0.5438]}

In 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. It was known as the National Land Question. The goal of this survey was to identify which land owners owned land in Ireland on which they could not farm.\nIn 1876, the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey called the National Land Question. The goal of this survey was to identify which land owners owned agricultural land in Ireland, in order to ensure that they could have this land to farm and that the Irish were not being forced to sell their agricultural land, which meant that they could not work the land and keep the profits.\nThe survey identified that only 3 percent of the population had land to farm. This was because less than 10 percent of the population owned land in Ireland. The government decided to solve the problem of land ownership in Ireland by making land sales illegal. The government banned this by putting restrictions on land sales, and they required landowners to sell their land to another farmer or landowner.\nThe government of the United Kingdom wanted to increase productivity in agriculture, for the purpose that Ireland could be self-sufficient. Agriculture would need to produce food so that the country would have no trade agreements with any country if it had a national agricultural production. The government did not want to allow any land sales so that it was easier for them to increase agriculture.","token_len":300,"entropy":[2.6222,8.5978,0.0962,0.2426,8.2839,1.1276,2.5939,5.0807,2.8029,0.3332,7.155,1.0373,2.3902,2.2555,4.3968,0.3297,1.4434,3.0825,2.2667,1.4828,2.6819,0.304,5.5444,0.2118,0.0003,0.3909,1.3171,6.0287,1.0765,2.0784,1.4656,3.0215,6.4583,2.005,1.3966,2.0792,1.786,1.3093,0.4475,2.7954,1.3174,5.4416,0.4175,0.5071,3.819,1.9238,8.3352,1.0056,1.6364,7.0559,0.8516,1.7078,0.7088,0.0639,0.1166,2.9959,3.3841,3.5642,3.3542,1.9486,3.5721,0.9848,0.5542,5.7159,2.4648,2.585,2.5076,5.1494,5.274,0.3652,1.7168,8.6138,1.5845,2.0856,0.2579,1.0189,2.1344,0.8038,0.6342,0.2261,0.0081,0.1573,0.0011,0.003,0.0072,0.0099,0.2639,0.0896,0.0279,7.1658,0.2047,0.5366,0.0347,0.0949,0.3802,0.481,0.1465,0.0032,0.0144,0.0097,0.005,0.0018,0.0575,0.3089,0.0014,0.0062,0.0028,11.4852,0.1054,0.1301,0.0214,6.6342,3.5064,0.8857,0.0425,4.0214,0.3291,2.0892,1.0708,4.4782,7.0564,0.2923,3.4926,2.2286,2.9619,2.5848,2.4589,3.5665,3.1578,1.058,3.2734,1.8401,0.2346,1.7925,1.5778,2.3716,0.4381,4.3294,2.3977,4.4583,0.5381,1.5254,0.813,1.5088,6.4985,4.1397,0.3742,3.125,7.2328,2.1174,4.5375,0.9079,1.0437,1.4244,1.7956,5.5157,2.3138,3.3177,3.9044,2.9546,0.0907,0.8774,3.4375,2.7361,3.8459,2.3167,0.501,1.4826,1.9156,1.3556,3.3949,6.3737,0.0987,2.8402,0.0652,0.1621,0.581,0.838,1.6319,0.9079,1.6656,0.3298,0.6221,1.7429,2.637,3.2034,0.6737,7.7942,1.4083,0.233,1.7652,1.5202,0.4286,1.9314,0.458,0.7392,3.1024,3.2738,5.1006,3.2211,0.629,1.6205,1.152,5.2815,4.3413,4.3577,4.8206,2.7276,0.1535,1.8459,0.6967,2.3185,2.2955,3.791,5.9584,3.3253,0.1952,2.0506,0.5462,0.6439,1.3221,5.5411,2.3377,3.1212,4.2281,0.8459,0.941,1.0786,1.1394,1.3992,1.4463,0.5261,0.0476,0.0044,10.6851,0.3544,4.8833,6.1876,1.8811,2.6319,1.5852,5.8019,2.1821,2.7844,4.315,4.1801,1.4603,2.2617,6.5173,0.1434,0.0395,1.1817,5.7517,4.2258,3.5332,0.3182,3.4979,3.7472,5.598,0.2309,1.7629,4.1277,3.5541,1.1947,5.8969,6.9272,6.9822,0.3916,3.5447,2.0627,7.2215,0.8194,3.1258,2.3858,5.429,2.7883,3.9082,2.2326,1.633,0.4498,3.779,0.5601,0.5464,0.5692,3.3598,3.1545,3.6612,2.8154,5.1361,0.4836,1.9959,3.37,4.9918,0.4515,4.9835,0.0268,4.9915,5.7587,1.2466]}

Fitch's introduction, and his commentary on the songs, has always been a plus with the sets he has been associated with.\nPhilip Guston writes in The New Yorker that Happy Working Song is the highlight of the collection, and the best song of the collection.

Following the French offensive in Champagne in November 1915, Italian troops were deployed in eastern France and reached the front in March 1916. Italy sent another invasion force, including aircraft, to Egypt in January 1918. The campaign was slowed by the First Battle of the Nile, and Italian troops were not involved in any major battles after the Nile campaign ended on August 1, 1918. Although the Italian army had not fought in the battles of the Eastern Front, a series of smaller offensives by the Allies beginning in December 1918 saw the Italians engaged in the Siege of Belgrade (April-June 1919) and the Battles of Monte Mejan (September 1918 -April 1919 ).\nIn December 1918, President Francesco Fascio ordered the creation of a special army, the Italian Expeditionary Corps (TEC), charged with a wide assortment of functions: to defend Italy's southern borders, especially against the spread of German and Bulgarian Nationalism, to supply Italian garrisons in Ethiopia, Sudan, North Africa and Sicily, and to participate in a large mobilization exercise in Italy, which was known as the Operaia. The expeditionary corps was led in the 1920s by Pietro Badoglio and later by Count Camillo Cantoni, and was made up of Italian soldiers who did not belong to regular divisions, but were instead volunteers.","token_len":302,"entropy":[9.9453,6.5457,3.9836,1.5521,5.5836,0.0641,1.3364,0.0018,0.9677,2.9148,3.4703,1.205,1.1269,1.623,5.382,3.4803,2.0433,1.7371,1.5956,10.8682,3.6836,0.0084,1.0487,8.2429,1.5804,6.1027,2.0266,5.3987,0.798,0.3621,3.723,2.1539,7.6482,0.0068,0.6698,5.7263,0.6133,4.2567,5.0672,1.1277,6.9694,0.0054,1.2599,3.2707,1.1054,0.0976,4.6805,1.6948,1.9283,4.152,1.5958,5.5698,0.9392,2.1378,6.4422,0.8806,3.1654,2.2485,2.4242,0.3901,0.335,4.0885,5.0851,5.8336,6.4145,1.4268,2.0194,4.3428,6.8041,1.1644,1.4002,8.3388,1.1102,2.951,2.6185,1.001,1.7872,4.9037,1.7018,6.7803,0.4442,1.1117,6.3429,2.8776,0.0321,1.6336,3.8129,1.3572,2.8153,3.0031,1.6295,1.3508,3.56,5.009,0.282,2.9281,2.1901,1.3458,5.052,0.8511,8.3377,3.9794,2.113,3.4542,3.1353,2.4777,0.3321,0.5785,0.172,4.8076,1.17,1.7035,2.5007,2.2562,2.8457,4.4075,1.434,1.3239,5.5022,0.6461,1.7064,5.3812,0.226,0.6531,4.3349,3.7519,0.001,4.8477,8.0965,0.0101,0.0004,1.7379,0.9797,2.5444,7.8553,0.2982,3.5609,1.4936,4.3219,1.2563,1.8226,6.0255,0.1705,2.5535,6.663,0.0311,6.1507,0.5288,3.3965,3.3653,3.0098,0.8838,1.1518,1.4091,0.1521,0.6925,5.3046,0.0506,6.0324,9.0904,11.6979,1.0201,2.4775,3.1106,6.1367,5.6402,0.2834,6.1357,1.8253,4.1721,3.6891,0.6645,0.2505,6.3412,9.3448,0.0435,9.7702,3.6989,3.1052,0.8946,3.4151,0.0078,0.8674,3.063,3.2414,2.1,1.0528,2.798,3.7877,0.0165,4.6132,0.8926,5.8976,2.6491,0.545,7.2038,0.11,3.9357,3.9489,5.8101,0.002,6.0638,3.8787,2.6122,2.548,1.2321,2.2389,4.508,2.9091,1.3972,5.6948,2.9453,0.916,4.8175,0.011,3.4175,1.5028,6.7567,8.8092,3.0247,0.9861,1.0867,5.8018,3.9692,7.572,0.0001,0.0,2.7369,8.0179,0.7143,7.0986,0.4418,5.6327,0.1847,0.9603,5.9378,0.5624,0.8211,0.1748,6.4764,0.0735,4.1111,3.1734,6.8223,6.471,1.1379,2.6255,2.6971,2.4032,1.5991,4.9631,0.0816,0.391,7.7514,7.5002,1.4865,1.3822,5.4228,0.5059,0.3196,1.0729,3.2307,5.3316,2.5098,6.9744,0.1325,0.065,7.5503,0.0154,8.5249,4.3074,0.0842,2.3368,4.336,0.5186,5.2694,8.2689,2.4457,6.8879,3.7544,1.0609,2.4707,1.3782,4.4699,0.1211,0.1319,2.7043,3.0522,2.6714,5.8074,0.2139,3.0587,0.0287,8.5259,5.3261,1.8189,0.7906,1.1964,5.1785,3.6751,1.7504]}

However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, to a certain extent, has the other common house martin. Since they are now largely domestic in origin, they nest under buildings, and have extended across much of Europe in recent centuries.\nThe Delichon in the eastern Palearctic is smaller, more slender, and more heavily spotted than is the house martin in Europe. They have longer wings with somewhat greater tips. The tail is longer and less bushy.\nThe European Delichon is sometimes termed the delichon cherryskull, because it is black above and white below. This species is very variable, both within and between populations in the eastern and western parts of its range. It can be quite pale, much as the house martin : some have entirely yellowish or white plumage. Both populations are much blacker below than is the case in the north east Asia.\nAcross northern Europe, and possibly to some extent in central Europe, the female Delichon martins have a white throat patch. In eastern Europe, this patch is sometimes lacking, and the throat may be black. In western Britain, the male Delichons have a blue throat stripe. The birds with a white throat patch are likely to be more closely related to the Delichon in central and western Europe, a possibility which should now be tested.","token_len":304,"entropy":[9.6659,7.8519,5.4086,11.9569,3.5414,2.6701,4.8468,15.0722,7.4859,1.191,1.343,9.1686,2.2947,7.1221,7.6375,5.0833,4.7461,3.5136,1.8608,3.2352,2.2941,6.9942,1.9437,0.9752,4.4666,0.1037,2.0731,8.8026,7.1276,1.577,5.5992,8.6564,5.3355,6.5886,6.754,2.01,3.4739,8.0239,4.5094,2.9697,2.4852,0.1928,0.0226,7.417,3.8395,8.0273,6.8281,3.1989,0.1607,0.4547,1.7889,5.5656,3.167,1.1544,3.5081,5.0977,5.4821,4.7207,4.337,0.1555,1.2863,8.6921,3.5495,4.9528,1.7977,2.1553,3.4083,7.8596,8.1174,4.279,0.0489,4.1288,4.0644,2.8973,1.9676,0.306,1.4519,5.263,1.7031,0.0123,0.0113,6.5698,2.0084,5.5696,6.4821,2.7424,0.0081,2.3276,7.4027,1.9839,3.6361,3.2963,0.5054,0.2747,2.0536,3.9977,8.5725,0.9005,5.6908,0.4304,4.4173,0.0135,0.0408,1.7996,4.1994,0.493,3.4047,2.0341,4.8302,4.4461,3.9508,7.2187,4.8452,5.7786,1.8263,1.4743,5.9342,1.1352,1.9854,1.2635,4.5209,8.08,0.0219,2.0319,2.2026,1.0149,7.2839,1.1188,0.0106,0.0703,1.3145,4.7262,5.4894,0.9208,6.1699,1.0634,0.1694,7.797,15.8691,1.8499,1.0959,1.6774,1.1379,0.8518,7.0554,7.3787,3.2431,3.4137,0.3621,0.8829,2.894,2.9975,0.9163,4.0284,5.7601,2.0863,5.1004,4.4578,1.2114,0.8158,3.2712,3.3156,1.5421,3.0199,1.5747,1.4051,1.642,0.0107,6.3675,0.1715,0.3834,2.2437,3.1574,0.8068,4.8651,8.1201,1.9164,6.3006,4.3248,0.8121,2.8715,0.0106,0.2029,11.1923,5.5859,3.0689,8.9752,3.558,2.612,2.6825,3.2295,3.0587,0.0771,1.4094,6.2295,5.8428,1.3914,4.5365,8.5833,1.9219,7.873,1.8501,5.4861,0.2778,6.3222,0.8942,1.2655,4.4393,5.7571,7.9977,1.1389,0.9621,8.1801,4.5034,0.9892,0.5035,4.8107,4.3078,3.9159,2.0499,0.1594,0.9206,3.87,1.9807,0.3043,0.8408,7.553,1.1653,0.0018,0.0329,3.5702,0.9981,1.915,1.7758,4.132,6.3057,6.7601,2.1597,2.8708,3.6755,1.1049,0.4383,2.1651,1.4618,0.6143,3.6028,9.1761,1.1229,1.7859,2.1798,5.778,4.1271,0.8934,3.361,1.4869,1.7436,3.0084,6.3656,0.4109,1.2921,4.1971,1.1093,0.0043,5.4873,1.5717,0.8995,4.7206,1.2375,8.6731,1.2541,2.2318,8.6783,6.0161,2.904,1.5518,0.2118,1.2113,1.0368,5.4289,0.5865,0.7372,4.1127,3.778,0.1002,0.1861,0.5774,2.0072,0.0309,1.0923,1.7486,4.7606,1.4489,2.2869,0.5828,1.4723,6.002,5.8461,2.3153,4.8139,6.3326,0.2658,5.5242,0.8037]}

However, after the success, he decided to do another song named Pyooja which then became very popular.\nThe controversy over Arshad Warsi\nIn the year 2009, Arshad Warsi appeared in a song from Ra.One called Meri Baar which is a controversial song. This song talks about homosexuality with no context and it was only when the entire episode aired that the producers did realize that they had made a mistake. They decided to have a song removed from their movie.\nPooja Chopra\nPooja Chopra was the first female film actress to be cast in Ra.One. However, as it was a Hindi film, Pooja did not know Hindi very well.

The project included the construction of all-weather grade-separated lanes (2 1\/2 lanes), a 4,450-foot (1,070 m) two-lane interchange, bridge, and three-way stop in addition to four bridges, seven interchange ramps, and three signalized intersections.\nNY 47 has been called the \" Long Island Expressway, \" due to its long length, as well as New York State Route 47, a route in the Long Island Expressway corridor in southern Nassau and Suffolk counties.\nThe route was first introduced in New York during the 1930s by legislation approved by the General Assembly. The first segment of the route, NY 47A, opened in August 1935 following the construction of the Brooklyn\u2013Greensboro Highway in eastern Queens County. The route was originally designed to span NY 45 at the western terminus of the Brooklyn\u2013Greensboro Highway in New York City borough of Brooklyn at Bensenville, and connect to NY 41 at the eastern end of the Brooklyn\u2013Greensboro Highway at Staten Island.. Due to the need to create a connection to this highway, NY 47B was later created, and the western end of its route near Bensenville was renamed Bensenville.","token_len":304,"entropy":[9.788,11.8629,4.6723,5.0968,8.5876,2.1543,9.0731,8.9857,4.1718,11.0371,3.6116,5.3747,2.2945,2.2983,10.0767,0.3446,0.2878,4.835,2.8144,2.6246,11.3018,8.8874,2.1401,4.7403,2.4341,12.9899,7.3426,7.695,5.9539,4.4531,1.4077,2.7161,0.24,1.3333,5.9664,3.12,0.0094,0.3439,1.5295,4.7264,8.738,5.9063,0.2277,2.6655,8.2264,4.8472,7.2675,2.4159,5.08,1.8076,8.7581,1.9613,1.9789,1.6529,6.7192,4.4105,2.3158,1.9685,0.0503,6.2874,3.7653,1.8986,5.2283,3.1671,2.6048,0.177,3.6487,2.8569,6.3968,6.3912,0.3941,0.2215,2.1583,3.216,2.2628,5.0454,2.9175,6.2702,0.4024,0.7187,1.9451,2.4581,0.4368,5.8874,1.6193,0.0563,6.2156,0.1147,0.3928,4.4993,1.4802,6.6881,3.118,1.2825,4.9996,0.5651,1.5556,4.3184,3.9117,3.339,0.0034,4.4164,5.2884,2.1324,5.7813,4.5221,2.1555,0.4076,0.9204,3.1837,7.5278,3.3384,3.672,0.5064,1.6886,12.3761,7.3063,4.4276,1.4666,5.5419,0.7207,0.8169,12.5361,2.1128,2.2849,0.3707,4.4391,2.2955,5.4554,0.2153,0.6632,3.4161,3.8105,1.5014,5.6737,0.2931,0.0067,6.3859,0.1213,3.0433,2.9487,4.3816,1.8424,3.6281,4.8215,4.8234,1.4976,5.0539,0.0166,4.2394,0.0608,7.2515,4.7739,5.8027,5.0641,0.0002,5.0681,5.4885,0.5213,0.9327,1.4844,1.9824,4.9667,1.9058,3.4192,5.2122,0.433,3.9971,0.1439,5.1145,0.3391,2.9755,0.1551,2.3154,9.5395,3.5803,0.3018,0.6493,5.3803,0.0065,1.7766,1.3973,3.6121,6.2538,0.4429,0.4955,2.3922,2.1985,2.0154,3.5535,3.2196,0.6021,3.0988,0.52,5.3525,3.6088,5.6977,1.3767,2.9294,0.0372,0.7797,3.6984,6.861,5.3954,2.8979,0.1324,5.1013,1.8169,7.9262,2.2017,3.2653,0.5468,1.307,2.226,1.2438,3.3325,2.299,1.2591,5.0509,5.4919,5.0765,3.7289,1.3781,4.6312,1.9375,0.0037,0.1741,1.4464,2.8251,0.5045,0.4265,0.0041,0.0005,0.4354,2.8157,2.3656,0.1068,0.4341,3.0684,1.2264,2.0433,4.6855,7.5522,6.0601,1.2841,1.9898,2.89,5.0125,1.7762,2.128,4.4538,0.9189,1.0577,1.6113,2.2144,0.0628,0.4036,2.6763,0.0156,0.3895,0.0034,0.0008,0.1132,3.3827,4.3712,0.0015,10.8412,6.5853,0.0047,1.1181,4.5737,0.9287,4.577,1.1227,5.7397,1.5565,5.9121,3.7082,0.5579,2.6621,0.5923,4.1433,0.78,5.2541,5.4719,3.1485,1.8895,1.9149,6.7251,2.2687,0.2239,4.6932,0.8873,8.2197,3.1744,0.0868,0.0016,1.1573,3.3017,5.072,0.3339,0.0205,2.4118]}

{"prompt":"A weakly defined tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on September 20 , and crossed the northern portion of the tropical Atlantic and northern South America without significant organization . The wave","text":"A weakly defined tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on September 20, and crossed the northern portion of the tropical Atlantic and northern South America without significant organization. The wave weakened over the northern latitudes of the South Atlantic basin, and moved to the Caribbean Sea. The weakened tropical wave eventually turned northward and entered the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn addition to the ITCZ and WPW, an additional low-level center appeared in the western South Atlantic and tropical West Indies basin on August 15. Low-latitude subsidence, associated with the lowpressure center in the west-central Caribbean was not as strong as north of the ITCZ, but was associated with a tropical wave moving across the northern South America and central South Atlantic. This low-pressure center persisted until July 31.\nThe southern flank of the ITCZ and a distinct dry region were located to the north and northeast of the coast of Brazil, over the Caribbean Sea, and northward of the low-latitude subtropical jet. These features are typical of the southwest front of the ITCZ and the jet streak. A subtropical high, centered over subtropical Brazil, was a key feature of the mean state prior to the development of the ITCZ. The subtropical jet moved southward under the influence of the ITCZ. The low pressure center to the north of the ITCZ weakened and subsidence intensified over the northern Atlantic basin during the peak rainfall season in early 1997.","token_len":305,"entropy":[10.2103,4.4621,5.5128,11.357,7.2201,8.7003,5.1732,0.579,5.1821,0.3634,0.2022,3.4363,2.5531,3.6332,3.5988,0.581,3.3135,6.2348,0.7211,4.3699,5.4059,0.0045,0.781,4.539,3.3677,3.5944,4.3797,3.869,2.0511,7.409,4.7699,10.5871,0.6059,1.4023,3.0506,5.9927,3.3366,0.7355,3.8739,5.6404,0.0037,1.6404,0.8628,3.3694,1.2169,4.2785,0.9699,1.4124,3.4821,2.919,0.5009,3.8474,2.5474,1.6416,1.4134,6.2952,2.2451,0.6861,5.1712,4.6243,2.0233,0.7572,1.9629,4.4815,0.5184,3.2552,0.0562,0.1451,1.033,1.5228,12.3484,2.6229,0.5226,1.1689,8.8,6.2433,5.7588,2.9434,8.0785,3.2925,1.3034,4.8147,2.0704,7.5886,0.6963,1.4471,7.6837,6.7838,1.1687,0.7814,3.5273,5.0041,0.7029,2.3224,5.6516,5.9598,1.5723,7.5274,1.5801,3.8161,3.4039,1.258,6.2788,0.3318,7.8063,0.044,6.9004,0.9524,3.6612,4.6814,0.0522,2.1549,3.2532,10.7396,6.9912,3.2836,0.3848,4.0474,3.81,0.3386,2.0665,5.5694,4.6881,4.8159,2.1239,0.3983,8.6286,5.3829,0.1248,4.7218,0.0255,0.0045,1.8663,0.8833,1.9562,4.533,0.031,2.142,5.8853,2.6686,3.5022,4.5887,0.2556,3.7505,4.2101,3.8792,1.5819,3.2577,3.8175,3.9494,0.8983,2.8817,1.9279,0.0639,3.2104,0.4863,5.8523,3.1576,4.3363,3.3655,1.3861,0.8971,1.3816,5.2899,6.7169,0.0746,0.195,2.2261,0.008,0.0023,1.9351,5.8646,6.564,8.1708,5.2318,2.2253,3.2449,5.5384,0.111,1.7222,2.283,2.5399,0.0899,0.359,5.2717,0.2815,3.5133,1.9882,8.2476,1.1563,3.6582,0.5874,0.9464,0.577,3.7761,3.2048,1.8026,0.5449,6.1458,0.7739,1.0335,0.1248,5.2022,0.0115,0.1405,7.1954,3.9955,2.8175,4.9858,2.4034,4.2565,0.1007,1.4075,6.5367,5.6096,1.434,0.3718,1.196,0.0052,0.0027,1.0928,1.8396,6.2721,11.1377,1.9295,3.7799,5.4259,0.0007,0.0054,3.2934,5.6476,4.3916,2.844,7.3403,0.0039,0.0302,5.2019,0.4736,1.1335,4.7317,4.6464,2.4211,0.4792,0.3384,10.3985,8.6976,8.1127,0.0058,0.7046,6.1156,0.0208,0.3105,1.4778,0.0078,0.004,0.8425,1.588,2.9652,0.0001,0.0095,2.1492,4.0465,2.6113,0.2592,5.4688,0.7885,3.3234,0.0011,1.3836,2.8115,0.0094,0.0041,2.3031,1.4643,2.787,3.1277,0.4601,6.5509,0.0844,1.2532,1.4069,0.2724,1.1067,0.0027,0.0037,8.1783,2.6188,5.36,5.0114,5.0716,1.9743,0.4693,2.6043,4.0551,1.8029,4.6625,0.7998,6.0067,6.8317,2.1632,2.0189,4.0145,5.3878,0.4672]}

If all positive ions leave the plasma in a narrow beam, then both the ion and electron densities must have positive density. In a vacuum this is unphysical, because in vacuum it was shown earlier that even a small region of positive charge will give rise to an electric dipole, and the vacuum solution is not physical.\nThe first step in solving the problem is to assume that the positive ion beam is not of a high velocity, and is emitted close to the plane of incidence. The positive ions are then assumed to follow the normal to the surface at a constant radius from the centre. So when a negative charge is emitted in a region of radius R, the positive ions can be considered to follow the positive direction of the electric field, and the negative ones follow in the opposite direction.\nThis is known as the``Foster mechanism'', named by Professor J. I. Foster. If the positive ions in the beam are so closely spaced that they can be modelled by a single spherical ion cloud, they must all have almost the same velocity, so their kinetic energy E = 1\/2 mv 2, where v is the velocity of the ions, and so the mean energy of the beam is 1\/2 mv 2 0 = W.","token_len":306,"entropy":[8.6695,1.8922,6.1832,0.1027,1.1388,6.8097,6.8704,4.002,1.4586,8.4235,5.5114,0.0645,0.1352,9.2077,2.0925,0.1796,8.1546,7.5194,0.6296,1.244,9.9783,1.0694,0.6025,7.1251,0.7629,0.0155,1.5432,3.1411,4.4874,11.9752,5.0912,1.3661,4.4158,4.4242,15.8935,8.7987,8.3635,6.1198,5.0813,4.7542,4.0852,1.9991,0.0198,0.3888,0.7039,9.2927,2.3892,3.7619,6.6727,2.5583,1.8975,3.7497,4.9742,2.9285,4.6451,7.6928,0.5715,1.6331,3.4985,1.6202,6.0334,6.7721,0.9393,1.8516,5.383,2.3346,5.5435,0.9628,4.8472,5.0749,0.0042,3.599,4.8155,6.0815,5.4199,1.0593,2.5804,2.8763,3.8592,4.2738,1.3087,7.2576,5.5326,1.5626,2.3029,4.0277,5.261,3.5597,6.784,4.8284,5.975,0.1925,5.2578,2.05,1.454,5.3005,0.5532,3.0461,1.3659,2.9916,4.8326,4.3231,0.0315,2.7319,2.5917,6.2684,0.0781,2.2203,1.5174,2.5079,6.1509,7.2788,1.953,2.7776,7.4676,0.657,3.1069,8.1511,5.0101,3.2132,0.6291,3.8927,0.9218,1.2338,1.0382,0.317,4.9263,0.3602,1.0742,2.9398,3.8948,6.8406,1.1738,3.3632,5.4808,1.7059,3.8917,4.9967,1.1819,1.1724,3.9841,7.282,7.1268,0.1065,0.4271,5.7955,0.311,6.339,1.2092,1.786,4.2856,3.316,1.5628,3.1127,6.08,0.0359,4.4607,1.0993,4.5354,7.8019,1.0142,5.1247,4.2467,1.561,2.9083,3.8556,4.2941,0.4611,4.3441,2.0715,4.911,4.1966,2.2594,2.8405,0.9035,1.0113,1.1762,2.4528,0.9553,2.6722,0.9039,4.5328,6.4316,1.3385,1.1037,2.0875,1.6688,3.4047,1.2038,4.0385,0.661,1.0866,0.4952,4.5189,3.8923,2.2596,0.5475,4.5051,1.4847,1.8325,1.0662,1.8706,2.3297,6.277,3.4064,5.6421,1.0617,1.6492,0.0724,0.3899,1.989,2.819,1.2252,3.4893,0.081,0.9693,11.1805,7.4884,5.567,8.7154,4.0414,0.36,7.626,2.4767,3.7665,4.3852,0.4402,5.9301,0.1053,3.0452,2.07,4.7004,1.0667,1.7761,1.3953,3.6689,0.9611,4.4507,0.7148,4.5858,4.6031,1.2666,1.0314,1.0091,2.2784,1.2944,7.3208,1.1913,2.2856,2.2094,4.1993,7.0343,6.3809,5.8934,0.5625,2.4762,2.7655,4.2899,2.2536,8.9304,1.3822,0.0229,3.9953,1.6542,2.3723,4.0511,5.7374,0.399,10.0293,1.7808,2.5574,1.7983,1.8545,4.8647,4.5519,6.309,3.8852,2.6726,5.0212,0.0811,0.2351,2.5119,0.8867,0.3732,5.3636,1.8397,0.9099,6.3698,2.7743,5.4862,2.8212,0.7789,0.416,3.1767,1.0309,2.0928,0.9872,0.5781,0.6304,0.2338,0.51,8.161,2.527,6.8395,1.7898]}

Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode to the film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, describing the murder-suicide scene set in the forest as \" the most chilling, horrifying and effective moment since the death of a young girl at home.\" Tucker said that the \"shootout scene [with the police] was much worse. [...] They kept saying, \"This is getting a bit boring,\" and that was all the more frustrating.\" A writer at TV Guide, Paul Levine, also thought the fire episode was \"completely devoid of tension\". Levine compared the exit of Peggy from the village to David Lynch's Inland Empire, comparing the \"white-hulled, drunken teenager\" to the \"invisible child\". A writer of the New York Times, Kevin Williamson, wrote that the episode was \"off-putting [...]\", and called it \"shambolic\" in the final few moments. The reviewer also referred the fact that Nancy did not get uppity and go home. As for the scene of the murder-suicide in the forest, Williamson wrote that it was \"invisible,\" yet \"very terrifying\". A writer for The Chicago Reader, Michael Bock, viewed the first two events, of Peggy dying in the fire and the girl being murdered, as \"too far-fetched\". The series' writers Chris Chibnall and Michael Engler, also found the first two events far-fetched.","token_len":306,"entropy":[8.4613,4.3405,14.5652,1.0273,6.7999,10.6708,8.6745,2.0289,3.1509,1.2346,5.4197,1.2839,1.265,11.9616,7.5237,1.0001,7.3082,0.1598,7.4384,7.777,7.4928,11.5035,0.536,5.814,0.5516,5.3187,3.7765,0.2355,1.5848,5.1817,2.3367,8.5554,2.9342,0.0322,0.0061,1.1908,4.2306,1.5935,6.5494,4.9464,0.3135,0.0739,1.9276,9.4453,1.0717,1.2868,6.4298,0.8841,0.4626,9.4121,1.235,3.5599,2.9133,3.8895,1.5361,7.2473,4.6106,6.3714,1.3588,5.0639,0.0437,2.7021,2.6789,1.9037,3.5906,4.7126,1.0511,4.3687,2.0596,1.505,1.4781,4.1901,7.4283,1.7413,2.6326,4.9653,4.7844,2.8541,4.442,0.5572,1.4732,5.6349,3.6935,3.9848,6.5714,3.68,5.0649,2.3281,0.9379,3.183,2.6953,0.4257,6.2974,3.6793,2.6872,4.9162,1.8596,0.8308,2.3249,2.0287,4.0266,2.8996,2.2169,3.5835,1.888,4.5852,6.3069,2.748,5.1157,2.1367,1.7826,5.15,7.3798,0.1006,3.3501,6.1735,0.7469,1.866,0.4096,0.636,1.3676,6.0238,5.4517,0.0104,4.7648,5.8007,3.7952,5.3515,0.3569,8.7821,3.1548,1.1222,4.6273,0.5931,7.5859,0.7236,6.9265,1.7332,0.0948,5.5126,4.8213,0.0044,0.7351,4.0789,0.847,4.4163,6.9268,2.5962,5.2343,5.9402,0.3108,1.9336,7.1921,5.7832,0.7075,1.2871,1.3302,1.9828,6.2157,1.5042,6.5151,3.0158,4.3104,3.7046,4.9553,1.4391,2.8055,0.5981,0.3434,1.2337,5.8605,4.0634,0.1349,2.2943,0.8053,0.8382,2.7451,1.455,0.4551,7.7509,1.6164,0.3576,0.0002,5.8072,8.2799,1.7654,3.1619,1.0574,0.3174,5.8148,5.7983,0.1655,2.4623,2.811,2.2468,5.6835,4.3919,4.725,0.6349,2.9173,6.1913,3.9207,5.5176,6.2129,8.6008,0.0734,8.8468,5.8747,0.1646,3.2857,13.2022,1.3218,0.0466,3.2877,5.9485,3.7495,3.35,5.2675,1.587,0.8048,3.556,3.492,1.8529,4.7061,1.4756,0.0054,0.0036,2.935,0.9099,1.2193,0.4392,2.5711,1.4357,1.0718,1.44,0.8658,0.5868,4.7821,6.0663,4.3165,5.8112,1.5615,3.8934,6.7921,1.3037,3.621,2.1635,1.8592,2.0967,4.9831,3.1248,0.3802,3.9834,4.6257,5.1767,0.8144,7.5925,0.3146,6.169,2.2215,6.7272,4.1234,6.6903,3.046,5.2069,1.1485,0.4874,1.7994,1.2102,1.8177,5.2943,1.9726,3.8572,1.5196,0.17,0.7357,5.3608,4.4635,2.3406,0.1632,2.3235,2.5345,7.3736,2.4585,3.3302,7.7849,5.3776,1.6511,0.3271,0.0564,0.1451,3.7496,7.9457,2.3629,2.268,3.3677,4.7345,0.6884,3.5845,0.6894,0.7186,5.1985,1.2889,0.0002,0.962]}

They begin smashing clock guitars on a roadside, and a title screen appears, announcing that the song is based off the song \" No Regrets\", by the band, which came out in October of 2013.\nThe video continues in black and white with two men walking towards a bridge with no lights on. As they approach the bridge, the lights around them gradually dim from the bottom to the top of the bridge, with the two men also dimming. Then, both men disappear into the darkness.\nThe lyrics of the song are stated out loud by one of the two men, who continues to sing his voice out of tune ( as in the song ) to anyone who might listen.

{"prompt":"Julianna Helt from the Pittsburgh Post @ - @ Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda constantly wonders how time travel could be possible . In When You Reach Me ,","text":"Julianna Helt from the Pittsburgh Post @ - @ Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda constantly wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Miranda tells Leonard that she wants to re-live those moments because if she can stop it, it might be possible to change the events so that Leonard doesn\u2019t die.\nThe theme \u201cIf he could change things\u201d is a major underlying theme of The Big Bang Theory, as we\u2019ll show below. The subtext of the series' time-travel discussions is, in part, that it's a consequence of not having enough time.\nSo. If you travel back in time, where do you go? If your destination is any later than the very moment you left, you probably have no way of getting back to where you left. It's not the same thing with teleporting though. You can go to a future in which you never left and the time you travel to will be at the point where you have actually left. It's not the same with travelling down the time line.\nWhile travelling back in time, we also see the reality that time changes. As Sheldon himself has said, \u201cTime itself is a fluid; it tends to travel more or less at a certain speed. But it is affected by the rate at which matter and energy are exchanged among the different forms of energy, among the different parts of the universe\u201d (Sheldon, When Everything Is Coming Undone).","token_len":307,"entropy":[6.2685,3.6851,4.905,9.0348,7.6481,1.9826,7.056,1.4999,11.2449,8.6325,5.0693,11.2539,11.0904,3.3086,8.6859,4.9898,8.7831,3.5014,6.1892,2.0765,6.3729,11.0489,10.2729,5.6755,2.3683,4.2143,1.2054,2.8139,1.2904,3.5269,0.9095,4.5693,11.7568,3.7552,6.4724,5.0482,1.298,2.0619,3.6105,8.2509,1.1246,2.1907,3.9789,0.2742,6.5768,0.7986,2.5675,5.1556,1.6994,5.0478,5.1338,1.0149,2.5166,4.949,4.2414,0.7689,3.0859,3.2624,1.2673,1.2848,0.4339,4.1044,1.1231,5.1991,5.983,0.8611,5.7839,3.1526,16.2438,7.0954,2.8316,3.7695,0.8436,1.9418,6.1018,7.5933,10.73,5.7829,7.6554,6.0885,2.5798,2.2321,3.0074,2.762,6.6689,2.3118,2.6727,4.5199,9.1048,0.2451,1.4651,3.2509,5.4534,0.7931,0.0612,1.5513,2.8402,3.4082,12.6957,1.5829,1.5351,5.766,6.4056,0.3541,3.0652,7.9565,0.6684,1.3047,1.573,5.0934,4.0661,6.8635,2.8191,0.1456,8.7668,0.6391,4.648,2.7675,2.4147,0.227,1.6162,2.4777,1.9772,2.5028,7.1171,0.0348,5.3551,1.9303,3.1437,0.2798,1.9041,2.2795,4.244,6.1374,3.4867,1.2355,6.8968,1.8715,0.4262,0.0038,0.9506,4.3819,1.3876,0.2091,1.5085,0.8568,3.941,3.7504,3.4454,0.3973,6.3489,8.4657,0.5117,1.6957,4.9481,3.6026,0.9475,3.732,2.0857,2.3727,3.9986,2.8319,2.6662,2.2487,0.414,2.6708,1.1881,1.0337,2.0621,0.0222,2.1574,1.7221,3.6551,0.7808,2.1463,3.6751,1.3859,2.3831,4.1439,7.8739,1.2845,6.7297,0.6583,2.64,1.9743,3.1462,2.1708,1.8966,3.4414,3.4993,0.7423,0.9028,4.5119,2.1807,2.9615,3.8762,2.8923,1.5232,4.3134,2.0137,3.7514,1.8339,4.4705,1.2618,3.0881,0.7252,0.3085,3.7152,5.6444,1.6835,1.1434,2.9642,0.6174,1.8698,1.9931,0.0691,2.1916,4.312,6.2282,1.7874,3.1689,2.3692,1.0447,1.401,5.673,5.4334,2.1988,0.2617,0.0221,0.6311,3.2651,4.338,2.6534,2.2859,6.0734,1.6317,2.3978,5.9278,1.8681,3.4719,7.1171,7.8173,3.9326,1.6266,0.6083,6.8752,3.7812,2.2214,6.1127,1.4498,2.1637,6.6872,5.9248,1.0116,6.6845,0.0879,6.215,4.7306,4.0848,0.0025,2.8905,2.0539,2.8343,2.2055,1.0976,3.421,2.6664,2.4349,6.7397,0.235,1.5399,6.5173,0.8758,0.0003,7.9149,2.8573,0.8835,1.7668,5.0589,5.0358,1.9025,3.002,4.3199,0.1827,2.8788,2.2914,7.3027,1.1019,2.2492,4.4333,0.0164,0.8708,1.1417,5.4889,5.7453,4.1581,7.8317,0.0433,2.3071,7.0722,6.2318,1.8265,6.0998,10.7317,1.7083,1.8238]}

She won again the following year, beating her husband, who became more prominent as a skier. In 1907 the couple returned to the United States and formed the first professional figure skating company in the world, the American Figure Skating Company (AFSC). The next Olympic Winter Games were held in St Moritz, Switzerland, in February\u2013March 1908. As head of the AFSC, Sers took part in the event, representing the United States in six events.\nShe received a medal for team silver in ice dancing, a bronze medal for single silver in ice dancing, bronze in single silver, gold in team silver  and the gold medal for team silver as a member of the United States team. Her team set the most gold medals in all events, with eight, at the 1908 Winter Olympics. In her last two years of competition, Sers became disillusioned with skating as a career, but was offered a place on the coaching staff of the US Figure Skating Team in 1909.\nAt the time of his death in 1919 and in the years after, Sers was remembered in the United States as an effective skier, and also for his contribution to ice dancing. Sers died in Los Angeles, CA at age 64.\nShe was the last active figure skating athlete to hold American citizenship, and the only one to be inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.","token_len":307,"entropy":[7.564,8.9838,0.8005,7.3884,9.8847,1.4686,2.4646,3.0649,8.2972,6.3191,0.7181,5.1699,4.7747,12.1452,3.029,0.3697,1.5779,2.1097,1.9694,5.1073,3.467,0.3316,7.5235,3.3878,1.4397,5.6249,2.1085,4.5008,3.9507,2.3829,0.0524,0.5935,5.4849,2.876,4.0591,1.1276,4.1225,3.7274,6.2872,4.7756,2.1828,0.8629,3.3117,1.3375,0.9361,2.2634,3.5612,3.5681,3.6107,4.628,0.0918,1.7097,2.002,0.089,1.6865,4.4704,1.1142,3.5731,4.2161,3.5504,0.35,1.3675,1.6114,0.9198,2.6035,1.4948,2.0682,3.2807,3.215,0.0447,0.0476,1.7153,2.1544,5.7133,1.0186,0.6791,2.0011,5.3079,8.416,4.7297,0.1425,0.7523,0.1008,0.212,5.0766,11.2298,0.0316,0.3011,0.9604,0.8595,0.9457,6.2054,8.7972,0.269,1.7418,0.5885,4.5908,6.2954,0.6246,0.2819,3.7234,0.0007,0.489,5.4655,8.9,6.1687,4.5312,0.0316,1.2408,5.1614,1.5917,5.2034,1.3444,1.8916,0.0438,1.8384,4.8541,2.7875,1.0842,2.0677,13.8327,4.3696,1.7605,1.5678,2.1125,7.0335,8.4543,1.0013,11.1625,7.4826,1.5658,3.0461,1.5831,1.3546,0.4455,5.7871,6.2913,0.4874,1.8176,4.2165,0.3904,4.1726,1.952,3.7228,0.6989,3.3367,2.9703,0.4608,6.1702,1.5299,11.6944,7.5503,3.758,3.1806,0.8229,0.5157,2.1125,1.0551,5.1054,0.9315,1.9956,0.0478,0.2175,3.6286,0.0994,2.4551,0.6732,3.0971,3.5374,7.6205,1.7704,5.4811,2.8673,0.4381,1.0832,3.4431,4.879,1.5454,2.7302,4.0482,2.2595,5.467,0.6302,2.5932,2.0104,1.3882,0.8799,2.101,3.46,3.5159,3.6433,1.7787,1.3921,2.1515,0.4335,1.0193,0.0078,4.1804,11.5795,0.0009,0.1965,3.8649,3.3281,1.0189,2.3573,1.1446,3.1903,3.559,6.8451,0.8252,4.6274,1.2696,0.2178,6.3489,0.3681,0.9315,0.5713,4.312,5.1418,0.0594,0.0154,3.272,2.2011,2.8715,0.4226,1.6272,4.2058,0.4578,3.4648,1.3629,5.0257,0.9304,1.2162,4.5596,6.5723,2.6401,2.2469,2.9417,2.457,1.1024,0.579,0.0131,1.0679,5.637,2.7911,1.5096,1.8642,0.015,0.6793,2.1898,5.6305,1.9814,0.6978,1.2282,2.1352,4.6986,3.9937,3.4092,4.0927,0.1294,6.0861,3.1229,0.8277,3.3574,0.0267,4.0609,1.1294,4.8139,0.0112,1.2183,3.8228,2.9619,1.0614,5.268,1.7226,0.7683,3.2149,0.8434,3.1529,3.3861,5.9589,0.2444,1.2163,3.3344,0.7802,4.2991,5.0069,4.0754,1.363,0.9044,2.6713,1.6127,3.0884,1.1539,2.2913,3.1576,0.0006,0.1819,0.0613,2.4003,0.0102,2.014,3.4678,0.0178,0.0042,0.7981]}

The Palmyrene monarch fell upon the retreating Shapur at a place between Ramleh and Damascus. On the battlefield Shapur ordered the destruction of his army. The battle cost the king 8,000 dead and 200,000 wounded.\nThe treaty that was concluded by the two empires stated that the territories of the Shapurid Empire would be divided into two parts : The eastern part would be given to the Babylonians while the western part would be given to the Persians. Both the Empires would maintain an annual tribute of four hostages to each other. This treaty was concluded after a two-year conflict due to the fact that Shapur wished to annex the city of Antioch, which belonged to Antiochod. Shapur wanted to move forward and capture the city and its nearby territories and this was not possible due to the fact that the Greeks of the city were defending themselves and therefore the Persian king decided to enter into an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, the ruler of which was Emperor Arcadius. The Byzantines were not happy to have to serve two masters, but did not dare intervene.\nThe treaty made by the two empires is well known and is included in the collection of treaties known as the Great Assignment. The treaty was concluded by Shapur II on 11 July 290 BC and it remains the longest treaty signed by an Asiatic ruler to this day.","token_len":307,"entropy":[9.7374,8.651,10.4128,6.3797,12.1676,1.8627,8.6805,5.2627,2.2702,4.2349,1.9689,12.2728,6.9922,6.7454,1.7197,4.0371,1.5588,4.2642,0.8194,5.6913,5.3417,2.149,1.8183,2.182,7.833,3.6984,7.9612,1.2695,0.0077,0.755,1.8308,2.8156,0.0055,0.0191,7.8785,5.8283,3.3552,1.0896,6.4679,11.9613,0.3285,8.0994,3.6857,4.4928,6.2941,7.7854,5.3245,2.9253,0.447,4.4785,1.2895,3.7535,0.9992,5.7242,6.6187,0.0005,4.4848,1.2097,5.066,0.0119,2.7177,1.7255,1.5683,1.7204,3.8769,7.1225,1.2471,3.4052,6.6665,0.4376,0.3373,3.4177,0.5963,5.0138,0.3285,0.0027,0.5635,0.4046,1.4669,4.8275,8.8744,3.0889,3.1431,5.0399,2.6376,0.7558,4.0462,4.3577,7.8417,0.4788,1.1859,6.8392,0.9358,1.1458,6.6317,0.006,8.2617,2.9025,1.6103,0.4448,1.5091,0.8231,1.7323,1.5338,7.3668,3.8746,5.6728,0.6394,1.4367,0.4666,4.6191,0.3925,0.4732,6.6652,0.4644,4.1369,0.0447,0.468,0.2259,0.5724,0.1593,1.4113,0.0766,0.2966,3.0447,0.0009,0.2253,4.8203,2.6527,8.8478,3.2198,4.731,3.7186,5.6293,2.9779,0.602,6.0584,11.7066,2.3213,1.4543,1.2599,0.7734,3.2148,2.0217,1.0334,4.2764,2.9754,2.5735,4.8266,0.8528,0.7996,3.5587,6.8048,0.0277,0.8778,2.9789,0.041,3.0659,0.003,6.6175,0.2398,5.161,0.8667,4.6886,0.3871,3.9556,2.1059,1.2366,4.5782,0.0295,3.253,9.9556,2.898,3.8493,0.0017,4.9657,0.725,4.9532,3.6997,2.3243,5.1339,2.0229,0.6106,2.7258,3.9966,8.2736,4.122,3.2212,4.6353,1.3168,3.2312,1.3576,2.1093,0.0093,0.5778,2.5574,0.0412,1.2406,6.3229,4.9952,1.1684,4.082,1.2938,6.3895,2.1519,2.4828,5.3811,2.0891,2.4616,2.8845,4.074,0.264,5.7713,1.708,1.9539,0.4982,0.0552,0.7242,6.2906,1.7764,3.0798,3.0517,5.289,0.0582,3.811,0.5441,4.4458,8.7465,0.4307,0.1261,1.2146,1.6468,5.1154,0.0034,0.0243,2.1578,2.603,2.5178,3.7755,3.3868,4.3764,6.4134,5.4925,3.4778,1.7385,2.5258,5.0866,0.1444,4.069,5.6342,1.5476,1.6702,1.2041,4.3777,5.3714,2.081,0.4208,1.0508,0.5303,4.0285,6.064,0.1582,1.9026,1.8469,5.3095,0.151,0.4916,6.7953,0.3125,5.9193,4.8757,0.2286,0.5696,4.6051,13.5746,1.4799,1.4265,3.142,2.2468,2.7893,1.3091,4.4242,0.0022,5.7295,2.7893,4.3542,2.5572,8.6825,1.5805,1.5626,2.8576,5.0203,1.5114,4.136,1.6903,4.7577,1.0825,5.4355,8.8227,0.0834,0.0002,2.9842,2.7463,2.2712,0.5269,0.1962]}

During the same time a further eleven merchantmen were sent to the Black Sea for the French navy.\nThe French were not alone amongst Allies in sending merchantmen to the Black Sea. During the initial stages of the war Spain and several other European nations, including Britain, sent armoured cruisers to the Black Sea. Although they were only stationed temporarily the crews were given the option to either work for one of the Allied governments or accept service with one of the German trading companies. Many officers and men from those ships later joined the Wehrmacht.\n\nNazi occupation\n\nAt the end of World War II, all Soviet-controlled naval equipment was confiscated, including the two largest warships, the flagship and frigate Pyotr Velchekin. On November 7, 1949, Pyotr Velchekin and her sister ship Vladimir Lenin sailed to Hamburg, Germany; on March 13, 1950 Pyotr Velchekin and her sister ship Vladimir Lenin arrived at Wilhelmshaven, Germany aboard the U.S. Navy destroyer USS\u00a0Dixie\u00a0(DD-223). Both vessels were placed on the National Industrial Reserve. Velchekin was sold in 1955 to a private individual and is now part of the private museum collection at the Russian State Museum in Saint Petersburg.","token_len":309,"entropy":[9.7837,0.9122,2.607,9.1834,5.2769,0.1448,1.9335,6.232,6.7672,5.2892,5.4587,11.0215,4.7841,0.2374,0.8171,9.2487,0.7468,7.5741,4.5723,0.635,4.1642,0.0051,0.1239,3.3894,2.9845,2.744,6.2386,5.2935,9.2889,0.978,3.3348,0.6535,1.8106,5.4881,0.0582,2.8426,4.4071,5.1606,6.0663,0.3967,5.4549,5.9,2.5747,7.9764,2.4104,9.2677,2.7201,5.8905,5.439,11.9853,0.9496,4.0078,0.4126,4.211,2.017,4.1233,4.8029,7.525,4.6109,3.2095,1.3325,1.1,0.1709,1.007,0.3851,0.0138,3.0191,1.4305,6.28,4.0438,1.4423,1.4688,6.7531,3.8161,3.136,3.0922,4.4935,6.2216,7.2975,0.9481,3.581,3.1282,0.1126,0.4121,0.5045,0.1949,0.0031,1.0597,3.4123,0.3591,6.2105,3.427,0.0205,0.2112,1.3023,7.1094,1.9154,7.5632,1.2721,2.217,1.5291,3.042,0.9466,2.8654,0.3694,4.5185,8.1499,4.2596,0.0006,0.9193,0.2772,0.208,0.0018,1.4618,4.4445,2.9849,0.9208,4.4397,4.4388,5.795,5.3216,6.2404,1.318,4.3712,2.6318,3.1452,0.7355,5.6292,5.4804,2.823,4.4008,0.8824,0.8306,2.9212,3.0888,0.4364,6.9127,4.5419,2.776,3.0805,0.1199,0.4656,4.0157,9.2396,2.6799,0.588,5.1212,6.3403,1.8761,1.6914,1.8664,4.755,3.3428,4.7847,1.0224,0.4977,7.4439,0.0222,0.0011,0.0001,1.8019,0.8789,7.7745,8.0285,3.5404,2.06,0.0005,4.2966,0.4199,1.4054,0.0019,1.8348,0.0004,0.8008,2.1776,5.77,6.7588,3.1349,3.3846,4.5443,6.657,1.2105,2.7503,2.6395,1.9403,1.7909,5.4414,4.62,2.3024,1.3881,0.185,5.5229,2.8195,6.0165,0.0001,9.3335,0.3178,0.189,6.4437,7.8279,7.0071,1.2934,3.9418,3.575,3.0128,0.2725,4.1302,0.5987,7.9463,0.0032,0.0045,0.3709,0.0053,0.001,3.8305,3.7091,1.6979,2.4885,8.3147,5.7626,3.001,1.3179,5.6128,1.6657,0.2757,5.8885,1.8107,2.7569,3.6233,0.2425,1.2594,4.749,0.0011,0.0023,0.1692,0.0043,0.0012,1.0612,0.5557,0.4663,0.3502,2.327,0.3255,2.5598,1.0,8.8612,1.0935,0.4089,0.0197,0.3836,0.3735,7.0057,0.8753,4.7673,0.7885,0.0284,0.1544,1.9889,3.3272,1.1877,10.1728,4.6105,4.9843,4.4388,1.8421,1.8107,1.3031,6.5763,1.1985,3.7186,2.1449,0.6656,5.8452,1.277,1.6341,6.7826,9.5356,3.8979,3.3633,7.9319,0.0279,0.0013,1.3801,6.1801,2.4053,3.9662,1.1872,2.6418,2.7383,5.7676,2.6785,4.6076,2.0989,4.0297,0.0038,0.404,4.4486,4.0757,3.8759,2.0004,0.6835,5.0531,3.8432,1.0063,1.6012,6.218,0.0476,0.4036]}

{"prompt":"The play was first produced at the St James 's Theatre on Valentine 's Day 1895 .

It was freezing cold but Wilde arrived dressed in `` florid sobriety ``, wearing a green carnation in each hand and two white carnations around his neck, an allusion presumably to John Keats's poem A Carnival of Roses. Wilde's biographer Geoffrey Nicol commented that `` the performance was in truth a spectacular display of the play and its author simultaneously. `` The play closed on 10 June at the Lyceum, the same theatre that had opened on 29 April 1894 for Wilde's debut tragedy, The Importance of Attitude. In all eighteen performances were recorded. Wilde had intended to use the play to launch his career as an author but instead it was a failure. His biographer John Keightley wrote in The Oxford Book of Oscar Wilde :\n`` The first week saw little or no demand and a large crowd of critic and public, both male and female, were gathered to witness the end of the last night, but the performance was entirely lacking, and by the time it had been repeated the next day, the audience had mostly dispersed.'' The play was published in the Theatre of the Future Series in 1909, and reissued in 1936. In his essay Wilde wrote :\n`` It could never be made successful in the theatre... but it has a life all of its own, it must live and grow and find sympathetic listeners and readers in this land whose stage can never be more than secondary if it is at all.''","token_len":309,"entropy":[8.0799,2.873,4.8787,5.7147,3.6862,0.9756,5.9059,4.6663,2.2103,2.5953,2.7777,7.7737,0.0384,0.0319,8.1833,0.9095,1.7985,0.8883,15.6517,1.5747,4.1373,10.9106,6.0317,6.7268,0.6548,14.9755,14.4461,3.9315,1.6701,12.8396,0.4979,0.4467,2.7877,3.6871,4.2669,0.631,4.9066,9.6726,0.4902,5.4847,6.7626,0.5218,1.2992,5.2172,3.284,6.6842,0.1352,3.4012,0.2316,0.9809,2.2734,5.2685,4.8789,0.6352,10.0797,0.2308,6.7785,6.076,0.868,1.3584,5.2197,5.1248,8.6388,1.0814,4.1877,0.5523,3.2417,2.1357,8.2657,0.0944,6.8833,10.7094,6.7376,1.0517,4.003,4.0295,5.0437,0.8428,4.7398,6.0845,1.0667,7.4605,3.2591,0.1172,2.1424,5.2411,4.6157,2.1183,6.056,11.6808,5.9223,4.9901,2.0054,1.8466,8.2085,2.0041,6.5415,2.6421,3.3118,1.8444,9.2772,0.4946,0.0207,1.6602,2.7209,3.6385,6.2707,1.9583,2.1824,3.8809,2.022,5.6294,2.6967,3.0748,1.0021,3.5893,2.5773,0.4071,4.7853,10.2616,1.1447,1.8263,9.0313,0.0011,0.0335,6.2735,1.7122,0.6639,2.9332,5.852,9.37,3.194,7.0575,4.1891,2.6199,3.5686,2.8343,6.318,0.4456,3.965,0.9829,1.6845,1.6374,6.764,0.8972,3.1378,1.5668,1.709,2.4844,2.9934,4.5886,3.8459,0.7298,3.3236,6.4208,0.7057,2.731,4.6362,0.1628,5.2088,1.8824,16.2749,1.2747,2.4887,2.0795,3.3107,5.6888,6.3275,0.3562,9.9194,0.0124,4.6491,4.7231,3.5615,1.9189,4.365,6.6585,7.0857,7.0115,3.3625,0.1486,7.1593,4.5005,3.8057,3.9883,3.1753,1.5357,10.5492,1.627,4.482,6.2299,4.8689,3.2163,0.0177,0.0048,0.0873,2.3928,4.0528,1.6022,3.3636,0.8282,6.7562,0.1189,1.404,5.6852,3.8574,3.0508,3.0717,1.6797,3.1531,1.0253,6.5437,6.444,4.1854,1.3898,4.5478,0.8869,1.5302,1.8011,1.5451,1.7129,6.0049,2.3919,5.6178,0.7078,1.4229,1.4277,2.1452,0.6396,6.6841,3.0582,3.5529,2.5752,1.399,1.1543,4.1595,0.5844,2.5039,7.7166,1.5149,1.085,7.3731,9.2238,1.4247,5.9554,1.6907,1.2274,6.0493,1.9671,0.668,5.3552,1.1045,2.4182,4.229,4.0171,1.8491,1.9789,4.295,1.0391,0.2319,3.1193,5.9933,3.7785,1.4258,5.0499,8.939,2.0482,1.3062,1.657,5.2676,3.8255,1.4687,3.1955,3.5283,5.4816,7.1756,4.7792,0.1862,0.0632,1.2177,4.0823,4.6001,3.6134,3.2548,3.6135,2.3162,5.3841,11.2564,4.114,1.914,3.9713,2.9224,4.5876,5.3789,5.4719,8.64,5.2113,1.8189,0.8148,4.8066,1.6384,8.9021,6.6617,1.4449,1.2898,5.8521,0.1401,5.974]}

As with the previous `` Call to Action `` videos, this one highlights the fact that Scientology's taxpayer funded church health care and education program, which is allegedly for the benefit of Scientologists who have paid their dues, is primarily used to fund Church of Scientology operations as well as the welfare of Scientologists who do not pay their dues. The video clearly links the lack of an independent media outlet focused on exposing what appears to be massive corruption in the church to a failure on the part of the Church of Scientology to pay its fair share of government taxes, and thus to an inability to support the health care and education programs for which they ostensibly pay their taxes.\nThe video states that if you do not support the campaign to increase transparency into tax payments in the Church of Scientology, click here to sign the petition : http:\/\/www.corporatehumanity.ca\/hq\/index.php?id=1823.

The character was included in the original series description, though it was never part of the main cast. It was played by J. Michael Straczynski between 1984\u20131987 but eventually became a recurring character on Deep Space Nine itself. According to Gene Roddenberry, `` it took me six long years from The Cage of Fire to make Deep Space Nine.\n`` The show was conceived as a space opera featuring a Federation galactic republic under the leadership of Chief of Staff Riker. That mission is accomplished here so thoroughly; the writers are almost too careful, which seems unwise until you realize that they know they know, and that the point was never whether the Federation could fight the Dominion but whether it should have fought it. The Federation is too big to fight the Dominion, too full of bureaucracy, yet it finds the courage to do just that. The writers have succeeded in the difficult task of making you think that our heroes are really heroes, though they have no more than a lousy reason for wanting to do what they do than anyone else. They do the best they can; sometimes they succeed and sometimes they don't. Somehow the audience doesn't realize, but the fact that every individual character is a little bit like ourselves is important. Without that, the series wouldn't work - the show would be so much more dramatic if it focused just on heroes, even if they were very dull.","token_len":310,"entropy":[10.2494,4.9076,7.7741,11.2055,12.9472,8.1589,3.1524,1.0013,5.0263,0.1074,10.4119,2.2888,0.8893,1.5607,3.701,2.1138,8.2694,0.4621,1.6415,2.716,4.4644,0.3465,0.0368,9.681,5.2548,1.3989,1.0318,6.6218,1.3905,2.6779,4.4969,1.824,6.6591,0.3382,0.6331,3.331,1.4988,11.7276,1.7076,3.5901,1.498,0.7273,1.8399,5.0481,0.0037,0.3087,3.7504,1.7753,0.8935,3.5669,0.7287,5.2995,0.0776,4.8262,0.5723,3.7543,0.0202,0.0032,0.0016,8.7798,5.4355,6.5795,2.6777,6.3871,4.0131,1.7594,1.3341,1.6424,0.5842,1.7122,3.5503,0.0011,0.0162,6.8473,0.3979,6.0895,0.0012,5.3955,0.2424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3202,5.2026,5.9277,4.7897,4.3878,3.7977,5.1108,0.1567,4.6481,5.7089,7.3552,3.084,4.1785,0.3902,3.5608,3.6038,0.0086,0.0087,1.4138,4.9579,11.077,2.2291,3.7446,1.9373,5.1939,2.0212,0.3447,7.1348,1.0405,5.6309,1.6623,6.7743,8.7655,6.629,4.0209,0.7831,2.1296,0.0066,5.6541,2.9492,2.4422,4.0352,0.9585,1.2348,5.4914,6.8138,4.0892,8.7684,6.8209,7.1415,5.2942,7.113,1.667,5.712,3.7865,5.3408,4.5585,5.4819,4.062,5.1331,5.3913,7.054,1.1458,8.2,0.6611,1.1644,0.5679,2.7746,5.9079,3.136,5.4272,4.8088,1.6853,1.9119,2.0664,6.7121,3.8764,1.9339,8.1285,1.7537,0.8377,2.5713,5.5137,2.1368,1.9699,3.8041,1.4095,1.5636,3.9109,3.9619,2.0067,2.3068,0.4771,1.6555,3.1183,2.3435,5.6452,3.345,1.5699,1.9008,1.8774,0.0842,1.0249,2.6809,7.7436,0.2802,5.6652,0.9294,7.5592,2.1923,6.8366,2.9193,5.9014,0.2155,2.9733,4.7583,0.2742,0.5422,1.6747,4.3149,2.719,5.4293,0.3685,4.9361,5.832,0.7282,0.2418,2.3044,5.7857,2.3262,1.9717,6.9622,4.3727,1.0205,4.8527,3.1646,1.0604,5.3625,1.6366,3.8202,2.7374,4.949,2.8443,1.3022,7.8578,5.5224,1.2028,3.9281,0.2418,2.2765,4.2539,0.2225,0.6672,5.6105,3.5541,0.3194,1.0105,2.4735,4.0933,3.5729,2.4709,0.1286,0.0304,4.0637,6.5815,0.7553,3.8531,3.114,0.5147,0.1048,1.7995,0.0023,0.4062,8.2888,2.269,5.4703,3.805,0.0012,2.572,3.1617,2.0474,1.8138,4.3633,1.077,5.3332,5.7431,2.6108,1.3324,1.7213,4.5213,1.4894,2.2038,6.2568,1.3981,4.8142,0.9937,7.5567,1.7062,1.1683,1.6979,3.4199,3.4063,0.0021,4.163,6.3583,2.883,2.6363,0.9784,1.376,4.2261,1.6296,1.6454,6.6787,4.9403,1.1501,5.5864,5.2128,0.0576,6.0075,1.8945,5.3645,0.9376,1.96,0.9845,4.7142,6.8605,1.1894]}

On 20 January 1946 the entire Micronesia area was struck by Typhoon Imbudo, destroying much of the infrastructure, causing death and destruction in the region including heavy floods and landslides, and heavy winds and gusts around the islands with treefalls and fallen overhead lines.

Delahunt, commander, Northern Area ; Major General Leslie Stuart, commander of the Fifth Air Force, Queensland Air Force Zone, and Major General Michael T. H. Hillier, commander of the Royal Australian Air Force. By the end of 1943, the Australian Corps Division No. 2 ( New South Wales ) was added to the command, and the new Combined Area Command encompassing parts of the Northern Area and Western Area commands was formed. The Western Area headquarters, and a number of units from both Northern Area and Western Area, were withdrawn to the Australian Army in New Guinea for the Battle of Buna, New Guinea, in April 1944, and were then removed to the mainland for the subsequent operations of the Middle and Far Eastern campaign. In November 1945, the Command was renamed Combined Area Command, Australia. Following the transfer of Commonwealth responsibility for defence to the Australia-New Zealand Border Force, the Combined Area Command of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encompassing parts of the Western Area, Northern Area, and Southern Area commands was transferred to the ANZAC Corps of the United Kingdom in 1946. In 1949, it was renamed Combined Area Command, Australia-NZBFR, with the ANZAC Corps being transferred to the Military Survey of the NZBFR.","token_len":312,"entropy":[8.8066,6.6707,6.2417,9.8161,8.0657,10.2383,7.271,5.6247,3.4438,12.5669,0.052,1.1021,7.1287,1.306,1.5441,4.1809,2.7898,3.3659,1.9752,6.8746,1.4004,1.325,6.7294,3.7223,0.0412,6.6046,1.0277,6.1353,6.1295,6.2132,0.4505,0.813,6.2715,0.1141,4.9885,3.8402,7.1719,1.9521,0.9217,8.8037,0.9464,1.5449,0.7955,1.1896,1.4327,8.1769,6.0272,5.0108,4.2932,1.2641,5.2648,3.9652,0.5666,7.3602,3.9424,1.5707,0.6212,4.014,2.1257,3.5462,0.1741,7.9726,1.5911,0.284,6.8248,8.3136,0.2756,1.0566,3.4573,1.0654,7.8564,3.7311,0.7304,1.7419,3.558,7.981,0.3857,8.5718,2.1887,0.883,1.1622,0.1618,5.1196,4.0477,0.1082,4.6731,3.009,5.9217,4.4665,0.1261,0.5304,0.7962,0.223,4.8932,1.1343,0.0574,0.0389,0.8999,5.2699,1.4837,0.7582,0.003,2.4525,0.5769,1.4654,4.5218,7.0782,6.2828,7.8491,0.1071,2.4653,2.8205,11.2741,1.3307,0.0015,1.2374,1.2386,6.7867,0.2174,0.4783,4.1893,2.3957,1.3636,1.4786,4.4119,6.6136,3.9471,0.9224,9.4847,3.6824,4.9499,0.0204,1.7942,2.8033,0.5196,1.745,2.3874,0.1715,6.4118,1.1034,1.9666,0.8537,1.5328,4.5502,0.1064,5.0069,2.959,4.7782,4.0958,2.1784,0.0055,3.8174,3.7744,4.2031,2.8834,0.5219,0.0886,0.4916,0.0191,0.9544,0.5001,5.79,2.2158,1.3035,3.4537,2.4176,2.1996,5.6202,5.239,3.955,2.1194,4.783,0.0188,4.2433,6.1961,2.646,3.0155,0.0696,1.2752,1.5464,2.5821,0.9761,2.2788,1.227,3.0458,2.7769,6.3118,0.5234,1.2889,5.0629,1.4744,1.0595,6.1153,3.1734,1.4185,1.0871,7.5621,5.142,5.2733,1.8791,6.3551,0.5048,2.5854,3.5714,2.9832,0.2896,0.8257,4.5059,2.1816,2.9548,6.3002,0.6541,0.5623,1.5722,9.3152,1.8981,5.4421,0.4636,5.7035,0.2652,7.7198,4.4223,1.119,4.9198,1.8976,0.607,5.8821,1.8437,1.1784,0.1579,5.0003,1.3922,0.7632,0.9547,3.8361,0.1016,0.4374,3.6895,1.2052,3.1894,1.3362,3.6808,0.02,0.0002,0.0709,0.0375,0.0127,10.2117,5.0511,2.0838,0.0047,0.7793,2.4815,0.4145,1.5887,3.8061,0.371,0.7188,0.5873,2.7775,0.1027,3.9067,0.8997,2.2496,0.21,0.2869,8.8594,0.1881,1.3054,5.537,3.0321,1.4,1.5199,0.8787,3.5476,3.434,0.3257,2.2212,3.091,0.2173,4.7265,0.2601,1.6165,1.2991,0.2625,0.4628,0.7977,1.1614,5.539,5.8369,5.5545,9.6922,2.121,3.1321,0.894,4.5645,0.0402,0.0141,0.357,3.4302,3.3258,0.2106,0.3289,6.7608,8.6856,3.867,1.2494,7.4434,0.5493,0.2367,1.2961]}

( 1 July 2011 )\nIn recent years, populations of brook trout, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout and bull trout in the Klamath River, and the Columbia River have been declining ; salmon in the Willamette Valley and Lake Clallam have been increasing.","token_len":313,"entropy":[9.623,3.1759,3.3818,3.2399,1.1605,4.4588,0.0067,6.0831,3.3361,5.4662,11.3895,12.6372,9.0987,3.3842,1.7432,4.4441,3.4948,4.8866,5.0903,5.6564,3.2613,10.8865,1.4915,2.8505,2.3986,0.0137,0.2897,9.4081,14.4985,7.3506,3.3239,5.483,2.8645,3.9481,7.3684,11.2033,5.9273,8.652,10.0976,2.5841,1.3642,1.0009,5.6998,2.9878,5.9727,3.7248,4.1783,3.4227,5.7018,5.2128,5.171,2.556,0.3654,7.4196,3.4924,0.4083,5.6512,4.1942,0.7918,5.7675,8.525,2.7766,3.2965,4.1644,0.5678,4.0378,0.7106,7.4539,0.6797,6.8198,2.5443,2.7901,0.1791,4.1588,1.7968,3.9934,8.6997,4.2689,9.5217,5.3535,5.2231,6.9504,10.1682,2.3595,1.501,1.2575,4.8064,6.5435,1.8034,0.0061,4.3348,0.2036,2.221,6.9288,5.8958,3.0332,0.3184,6.7978,1.8827,2.2984,1.5082,7.5223,3.8206,1.5916,0.3258,10.0783,4.0413,3.7196,6.7728,1.9774,1.9309,0.3572,0.0149,9.8872,0.3086,0.8914,1.6195,7.8593,4.9638,1.8326,0.1808,0.5755,2.0204,2.4432,0.4932,0.0019,2.1896,0.0584,0.2385,4.3023,0.641,3.1285,0.61,5.4994,0.0892,2.4293,2.4098,5.5132,4.5302,0.0846,5.465,1.0422,0.8314,3.7152,6.1774,0.5201,10.5133,1.4271,1.1761,6.0949,8.5318,5.0721,6.3072,3.5818,2.1313,2.4842,0.3299,1.2056,3.4005,3.3997,9.3254,0.0013,2.9369,0.9011,0.5107,2.3895,2.6334,0.0662,0.3221,1.6015,6.7298,0.029,3.7644,0.7982,3.3955,1.1989,2.8383,0.4731,1.2543,5.2318,0.1006,2.7101,3.328,8.3764,5.4612,0.0015,0.0448,1.7626,4.3167,0.2354,4.528,0.0409,5.2193,0.8938,0.1479,1.2044,0.8064,0.9652,7.2964,0.0905,0.3253,2.5965,0.4907,1.3703,0.4179,0.0392,0.2271,3.2052,1.3294,3.457,3.8208,2.946,1.6509,5.3777,3.7476,3.7785,0.3986,2.8281,1.022,9.1479,0.5539,1.0382,3.0148,0.563,4.823,0.7579,1.9587,3.3286,2.3892,1.7987,0.304,6.0928,2.5802,2.64,1.4158,2.4328,0.0523,4.7667,5.7323,1.6885,0.0061,1.8401,1.6309,0.5178,0.8155,4.1586,1.5149,0.9803,0.0413,1.5014,3.7174,1.0639,6.4814,0.2478,0.6076,0.1842,4.8657,1.6818,1.2931,0.0691,0.207,3.0306,4.9202,0.0719,0.5368,7.098,0.171,8.0909,1.1841,0.0247,1.4674,7.4914,0.402,0.008,0.1123,0.6803,5.0231,0.0152,0.8553,7.251,0.1394,3.4912,1.0716,7.6318,0.4091,0.0005,0.6774,2.8955,2.9655,1.453,2.0457,0.19,0.9757,0.9542,2.2569,3.933,4.8903,2.9095,0.6852,7.6024,0.0988,0.0001,1.9112,1.9738,4.676,5.178,4.8034,0.0071,1.3313,0.85,3.8381,2.1838]}
{"prompt":"To supervise the construction of the pipeline , Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project . Bechtel Corporation , from San Francisco , was named the management","text":"To supervise the construction of the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the construction of the pipeline and it would be the largest government contract ever awarded to a single firm and the largest in U.S. history, with a value of $40 million. It was also the first large piece of construction work ever done in Alaska.\nDuring construction, the engineers used an underwater pipe to conduct measurements to establish the depth of the pipeline. Because it was not feasible to dig a hole in the mud, they had to take the measurements in the pipe that was being installed. The pipeline was built using a technique called a tube and casing method. The ground was then backfilled and the pipe placed in the ground.\nThe pipeline was initially constructed across Denali National Park in 1962, but the park was eventually removed from its route. The pipeline was eventually finished in 1968, nearly four years beyond the original schedule. Despite not having enough water to begin commercial operation, the pipeline flowed water throughout the year. It became operational in October 1966 with a flow of about 1 million gallons per day.\nIn 1974, the line was completed from its start near Fairbanks, to the oilfield in Pelly, a distance of nearly 200 miles. Water from the pipeline is supplied to Alyeska as well as to several other Alaskan communities and it is sold to customers in the Yukon, Alaska, and British Columbia.","token_len":313,"entropy":[12.045,0.003,1.6566,5.2166,0.3819,1.3419,5.8327,0.7619,12.0135,4.5906,2.3004,9.4295,3.8996,5.3965,5.9514,6.9993,1.1851,1.559,4.1139,1.9155,5.2415,7.1807,0.3616,3.5243,0.2411,1.1399,0.599,9.2353,3.5493,0.0552,7.1979,1.2413,6.7317,5.7924,1.0922,0.2127,1.9802,5.5581,1.3564,7.1025,0.2206,1.6055,0.2632,3.5619,1.1368,0.1331,1.0022,2.6785,4.533,4.2237,1.0939,1.4643,4.2151,7.1431,3.0521,2.3154,0.7126,0.7198,0.444,4.0455,3.0815,4.6836,1.3077,1.3761,3.572,3.4811,0.0005,0.001,0.0522,0.1557,2.7313,2.6388,1.7779,2.7984,0.1956,0.551,5.0784,2.6417,0.3031,3.5634,1.3958,1.8975,0.7312,1.4812,4.1517,7.1627,0.0155,2.8703,2.1589,1.6625,2.0909,1.5065,4.4025,0.9209,0.8008,13.2979,2.5085,0.6357,1.0421,7.4571,2.9309,3.8371,4.9051,5.089,0.7086,5.4305,4.402,2.3295,4.4579,0.6552,2.9163,0.4293,0.1658,1.987,1.025,5.3957,2.7533,0.6572,3.2034,5.2474,0.1784,4.5751,2.6224,2.7499,1.1936,0.1906,6.0718,1.2945,2.0856,3.0181,0.1407,4.975,2.0236,6.2064,2.383,1.9202,4.5804,4.833,1.6987,3.8741,4.8953,1.1538,1.4955,3.4286,1.2182,2.8383,2.5559,1.531,5.2414,0.7504,3.8561,7.3147,4.6024,8.4375,3.6457,1.0178,1.2855,6.9653,1.6348,3.0756,9.0053,1.5102,2.3751,1.1052,1.7171,7.2201,1.0476,1.2352,1.2588,1.2525,1.6618,1.5161,2.834,0.9873,4.9027,2.4046,6.6501,10.54,0.05,2.9308,0.5166,1.43,6.6252,1.5811,1.0576,1.8729,4.4649,0.8303,4.6901,3.743,1.129,3.4969,5.9753,2.7907,1.4181,3.0691,0.9294,3.1987,4.9514,0.5416,3.6999,1.217,7.1841,3.2805,0.6105,9.9655,1.0525,1.9747,3.1366,0.7684,5.825,5.9013,1.3519,4.7435,2.3267,0.6265,4.6414,8.3697,3.3728,0.413,0.6799,2.2318,6.5435,6.2961,5.1691,0.6513,5.305,1.7777,2.7116,4.7165,4.471,0.5664,3.732,5.0365,3.5857,1.8658,5.5245,0.6532,2.3547,2.3401,2.3861,0.4632,0.6932,0.319,0.495,0.877,2.6846,3.9043,0.2693,1.0323,5.0507,0.6368,2.4946,5.4512,5.0116,5.6922,5.7429,5.4742,0.07,0.8041,6.8837,1.8691,6.8362,3.2551,1.7847,5.4011,9.037,1.5208,5.2227,4.9343,0.0604,3.9744,3.8828,0.1518,0.4494,7.3139,1.8408,0.2772,0.8866,3.804,4.3996,1.4131,7.9664,0.0049,0.0036,5.0962,1.3785,0.3042,1.1112,3.8207,1.1658,7.2435,0.0019,0.1401,2.5078,2.9138,3.9036,0.8301,4.1786,0.773,5.4425,1.1539,1.7139,6.7946,0.0001,2.3627,1.6631,0.8228,1.1482,2.7843,0.0054,0.4008]}

According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves ( 0 @. @ 0006 % of the calf population)were killed by cougars in Texas (Davis & Cunningham 1991). Data collected during this study indicates that the population growth rate is greater than previously known (N = 1,400) and probably represents a substantial portion of the current cougar population (S. R. Garven, personal communication, 1990 ).\nThe effects of management on cougar abundance are not currently known for the United States, although similar techniques have been used by managers around the world. Cougars are considered an unpopular species, especially to some Native Americans, and are treated as dangerous animals which need to be removed with as little disturbance as possible, although the exact purpose of this is controversial (Bourchud 1991). We would recommend that the use of fire to control cougars in managed lands in North America be limited. This study showed that an unmanaged stand of ponderosa pine was in an early stand stage, with the first growth and seedlings emerging about 15 years before the fire. With fire exclusion and the accumulation of fuels, fire frequency in these stands would have increased until an opportunity occurred for the trees to be harvested for fuel reduction. Such a stand would have had more fuelwood available. During this time, management decisions regarding other resource uses would be important, especially in unmanaged areas, although no evidence based management would seem to be necessary until stand dominance is complete.","token_len":314,"entropy":[1.9437,4.415,3.0839,0.3354,12.0847,0.1632,0.6266,10.7589,0.2583,1.3054,4.1378,7.2525,2.0392,0.0297,2.4916,2.0055,14.3103,0.6668,1.0407,5.2053,0.0007,8.2739,3.7317,4.9819,5.3683,5.1927,0.2117,6.8602,9.3336,5.2977,12.0425,11.9654,6.7018,6.571,11.5678,3.6947,6.3169,3.0816,2.0778,7.1409,0.7587,0.6541,6.8444,0.2615,1.1785,0.6961,0.0971,1.3468,1.4379,3.8429,10.2559,3.019,8.2118,3.4164,0.6969,7.5187,3.5304,3.3333,2.105,3.5716,3.862,0.2485,2.0364,3.3611,4.7618,0.5628,3.6902,4.7234,1.3381,5.5546,4.2998,1.5204,5.3956,3.8263,3.7483,0.4745,5.532,1.497,1.2457,5.6439,4.0538,0.8853,4.5078,3.6903,0.0524,0.3259,4.9499,3.1934,0.0511,0.3448,1.3724,4.5541,4.0232,5.1048,0.631,7.1208,6.486,1.5964,10.1107,0.0165,0.8873,4.5591,5.943,1.4538,8.796,6.4126,0.0918,7.1452,1.5031,2.4224,0.2992,5.0859,1.5852,2.4254,5.9213,1.5428,5.1601,2.0415,5.1095,0.0105,1.7957,1.9212,6.5525,8.0949,0.9898,0.055,0.6005,2.3948,6.9693,5.7178,0.0093,0.0772,1.2823,4.6047,0.562,1.1411,3.3552,3.0368,9.7859,1.7059,2.8655,3.1213,3.5168,4.8158,4.895,0.625,1.8278,1.4158,2.2337,5.637,0.7143,5.0404,3.1149,5.6995,4.4882,0.5602,0.0143,2.7198,5.8887,5.777,0.3867,4.611,0.18,0.016,3.2195,4.2917,2.534,4.2648,5.5324,0.2634,1.9392,3.8764,6.3603,1.0648,3.3839,5.7304,4.947,8.9725,4.5207,0.6799,5.3852,5.6233,4.0713,0.7627,2.1991,3.141,0.0106,6.2097,2.8546,0.9721,1.1183,1.0827,2.3674,7.9854,4.0678,3.5467,4.2808,0.1712,1.0513,1.9818,2.035,3.5854,3.6614,5.0413,0.2903,5.1389,7.7252,0.1949,8.9473,1.3821,9.4591,0.0424,2.0406,2.7436,5.2292,5.1454,7.1437,5.5638,7.9042,1.9309,2.4863,2.4322,4.1206,7.6628,4.2956,7.5538,0.6212,4.8825,3.8946,3.9924,1.8459,3.0338,0.8377,5.3027,1.7073,6.0276,3.5683,9.6991,2.475,2.9295,6.8774,0.0258,8.1498,0.9261,3.474,7.1661,3.0453,3.5745,1.6119,3.5975,1.2759,1.8313,5.7958,4.7794,7.247,3.0526,1.8958,1.9475,6.2459,0.0777,1.9492,4.1858,3.5423,5.5135,8.5992,1.0286,5.2831,1.3514,2.0648,1.5384,0.4907,3.8292,4.2633,4.7908,11.0337,3.1298,3.1045,5.1026,1.9433,0.9075,0.4644,6.7468,5.8995,3.0648,6.4068,6.0191,2.4157,2.0405,2.6089,5.6462,1.6436,2.9186,1.7668,8.5945,0.0095,1.9792,2.0062,5.1119,4.0583,4.1819,7.7749,2.8382,5.0117,7.2627,0.1531,1.2234,3.7745,5.4577,10.7385,7.8055,3.8571,4.8783,0.5075]}

Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below the tide line and concluded the foundation required would be expensive and uneconomical.\nAn alternative site, where a new pipeline would run in a straight line, on land, would reduce cost significantly. Despite these findings, the project moved forward. In October 2013, a federal judge rejected the government\u2019s appeal to delay enforcement of the permit barring oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, saying that the pipeline proposal, as it was stated and submitted to Congress at the time, did not present any real threat to the land bird or fishery resources on the National Wildlife Refuge lands.\nIn January 2018, the Supreme Court determined the pipeline itself was unconstitutional, overturning the earlier decision by a federal appeals court, and reinstating the Valdez Terminal as the only place where oil companies could safely store oil. In March 2018, a federal court ruled that the permit for the TAPS pipeline, from the North Dakota state border to Valdez, was not needed.\nIn a June 2018 letter sent to the U. Department of Justice regarding the pipeline, Trump administration attorneys, Michael A. Koss, Jr. and Stephen G. Scherr, said, \u201cWe are concerned that, since the DOJ did not seek a preliminary injunction, the government\u2019s arguments that the pipeline will cause substantial environmental harm are speculative at best.\u201d","token_len":314,"entropy":[12.824,0.6205,8.867,3.9917,1.77,2.4555,6.1081,3.7679,0.0171,0.5683,6.4175,0.7947,2.3918,6.4859,1.9412,2.1425,5.2359,5.924,0.5144,7.6097,10.0853,0.0019,9.6807,0.9155,0.4086,1.319,4.8792,0.0027,9.7123,1.1791,9.7728,3.7662,6.5999,12.3322,3.2969,0.6451,6.5666,0.8864,1.8702,0.963,8.5608,0.9771,2.0101,9.9489,1.9093,7.0949,4.7555,6.6106,0.7667,10.1743,1.7064,4.6243,3.273,0.015,1.0048,1.3754,15.7971,4.3161,1.8634,1.7459,4.4239,2.7467,3.6932,2.9223,1.2177,2.5443,4.4321,1.9481,3.9701,0.0589,1.4604,6.5084,4.9318,4.3331,1.0994,5.5084,4.0673,3.2476,0.9406,6.791,3.3996,4.4127,0.072,1.1417,1.781,7.5572,0.5129,2.5005,2.6237,3.2886,2.2939,0.1727,2.3379,3.5344,0.5907,3.6837,0.9688,3.583,18.295,8.0569,3.7562,3.2316,2.0494,4.0829,7.6909,0.4342,0.4684,3.2076,9.1793,5.147,1.7101,0.0846,2.7424,1.3824,0.5172,4.8396,2.4781,0.0187,0.0012,1.5903,3.8443,1.935,0.7961,3.8107,5.8734,3.9811,3.5365,2.3363,1.5093,8.4619,4.885,4.296,1.4858,3.7178,4.8997,0.3364,0.1732,0.0391,2.6922,0.0213,7.1717,2.9426,3.9107,1.872,0.1402,0.9303,4.756,11.498,4.2454,5.6334,0.0321,8.3243,4.2599,1.8627,5.1817,0.1715,0.0023,6.0111,0.3269,0.7627,2.4256,2.9356,6.3539,0.0571,0.735,3.9936,0.0065,6.6698,2.2543,3.4124,7.7134,1.2451,3.2999,1.63,5.2779,0.0007,1.2137,4.5491,0.7498,2.1046,1.5173,4.1877,1.2842,0.0154,2.3591,2.8139,6.2234,0.287,0.023,0.6707,4.4769,0.0001,5.854,4.3435,1.2145,1.9933,4.6688,2.256,1.9646,5.9622,0.8328,6.2781,5.7305,2.6088,1.8925,2.7371,2.9144,1.0816,0.046,2.4313,1.1581,2.6653,1.8632,0.6843,0.6506,3.5926,3.1027,0.6543,7.5744,8.1536,1.9819,2.5776,6.2076,1.54,4.4676,0.4745,4.6157,5.2782,0.4222,3.2014,0.0001,0.441,1.075,2.731,4.2486,1.7889,0.9196,2.0445,3.8735,3.3751,1.2389,2.6536,3.755,0.2021,1.1236,2.6213,0.0015,17.1569,0.001,1.5962,5.0947,0.3141,3.2936,0.8452,6.8884,4.5525,2.2791,3.5983,6.3708,5.2225,0.1115,5.3244,5.261,1.0481,2.3631,1.2938,0.1044,3.4895,3.383,0.0539,9.7225,4.1942,0.8487,3.0809,2.6573,6.1638,7.1608,4.9157,1.7326,3.0071,0.6639,4.2755,4.5077,0.7138,7.5817,3.4164,0.0413,3.8817,1.7232,3.5317,0.0256,1.3329,0.8297,3.7589,8.5269,0.2984,0.0569,5.1042,2.6489,0.554,2.4927,3.9477,2.6481,4.5862,2.1367,0.4024,1.8675,5.3487,3.1504,0.0163,1.0023,3.3595,6.3252]}

Stamberger felt the show had already taken a step forward with this episode, and he was satisfied that that step was taken. While the season premiere and the finale episode received mostly mixed reviews, Stamberger thought that the series had been good, and that this episode was a little too cheesy compared to the others.","token_len":316,"entropy":[8.8918,7.0349,6.0989,0.577,0.101,2.1419,10.313,13.315,1.68,4.1694,6.1072,4.5731,0.0565,0.2527,4.7536,0.9585,0.3948,0.6717,4.7083,0.8917,1.4943,3.4367,1.6189,3.7837,12.22,12.8365,12.3584,1.9543,8.583,8.0247,6.7372,5.2409,4.7338,1.4052,4.4695,4.7972,12.1246,2.0344,6.0872,2.9653,5.3082,4.5737,3.1509,4.5293,0.1137,1.7068,3.6811,8.2091,1.1965,7.4613,7.8744,8.3408,0.1059,5.6979,2.3294,3.7415,2.6697,2.2878,2.0908,2.5766,1.7525,4.0606,4.803,1.141,0.7643,6.6536,2.2103,1.5092,5.1739,1.2627,5.0655,4.92,6.1313,5.0265,4.8795,0.4782,1.5702,8.9706,1.5122,4.0262,3.07,0.5467,0.7555,5.2168,7.631,2.231,4.519,5.8266,0.4234,2.3212,6.0316,1.9934,2.051,1.0309,2.0397,6.4799,1.4048,5.8014,3.2413,0.9711,2.7053,5.7899,0.4654,1.4246,3.7571,3.283,4.7355,1.1304,5.7484,2.7627,3.0517,2.6653,1.1613,0.5488,1.6045,4.7309,0.0015,4.3034,2.2855,0.2168,2.737,8.6668,0.272,3.9982,0.7482,3.3361,1.8919,0.7188,6.2152,10.6248,0.0859,9.5913,5.2107,7.3809,8.5479,2.8047,4.0559,13.0278,1.1045,1.1333,1.1834,6.8495,2.1539,0.1374,0.0265,1.6086,4.8219,1.7163,1.2339,4.7567,2.819,1.3501,6.9933,4.3499,3.7099,4.7607,2.6917,4.1753,2.012,6.2203,2.6861,1.5178,3.3297,1.6469,3.3297,4.0223,5.653,0.5679,2.7955,1.0342,4.1349,1.6093,5.4274,3.022,3.7248,7.1858,0.4238,1.9723,0.9194,6.2317,7.9362,4.6596,0.9587,0.7916,6.0882,0.4894,2.9955,2.1504,0.2728,2.3472,3.8029,4.1546,0.5027,0.064,1.4375,6.3449,2.1423,3.4391,0.9389,4.9336,4.0284,0.9512,1.6214,4.2017,2.3236,0.0019,0.6546,4.7462,0.0249,2.2837,4.9688,4.0309,1.5319,1.4473,0.9297,2.7074,1.5761,2.8458,1.4298,2.6372,2.046,2.3111,1.547,2.2075,7.4096,6.0253,13.2249,0.425,0.8249,1.2722,2.1449,5.3801,0.5806,0.4729,0.9803,3.523,0.6147,0.1985,6.4442,1.8568,3.057,1.1399,3.4128,0.1642,0.8777,3.5078,0.0023,4.1761,3.6434,0.9524,2.1783,2.8381,0.0381,0.0032,5.6992,2.2038,2.2008,2.4078,4.62,4.5265,1.4786,1.8462,1.1607,2.6335,3.7434,2.2316,0.4693,1.2779,2.309,2.8794,4.1023,2.1223,5.696,2.9476,1.0603,0.8254,0.3376,4.8306,1.9153,4.6084,2.4396,5.1629,1.6652,2.2749,6.1726,4.3999,4.3777,3.9556,0.0741,0.3354,2.5285,0.0426,0.0024,4.4609,1.117,0.9144,3.8581,1.3923,2.9828,2.9885,2.3078,0.7083,1.1111,3.6586,1.3812,1.0994,1.9431,3.5738,1.6213,7.4882,6.1669,0.0513,1.0487,2.2179,0.3727]}

Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez only once names his protagonist as Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the famous historical figure, but it can be guessed in context. In fact, Bol\u00edvar was the symbol and ideological underpinning of the revolution of the independence of Colombian from Spain at this time ; he became the hero of this revolution after it suffered several defeats in his previous confrontation with the Spanish forces, including that of Boyac\u00e1. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was a character who was admired for his intelligence, skill and courage ; with these qualities, he managed to conquer several countries and become president of Colombia.\nThe narrator of the book is a young officer; he is part of the revolutionary army of Colombia, he has not a strong character and his actions will be based on the command of his superiors and not on the basis of ideologies. He is a brave, intelligent and ambitious man, but also he is an idealistic and not practical soldier, a perfect person for an underworld of criminals who have become part of the new order in Colombia, at that time. After reading this novel, it can be deduced that the author was of the opinion that a revolution has to be led by a strong man and not by idealistic and emotional characters. For this reason, the main character is never identified by a full name and the narrator is always referred to as `` General. `` This is a novel that highlights the importance of the ideological factor and its impact in military and political power.","token_len":317,"entropy":[8.639,6.8559,1.2586,0.812,3.5168,0.9385,13.2106,7.9985,7.8913,5.4658,2.6489,5.6805,3.1154,1.9165,2.6715,8.7632,0.147,1.7762,1.0047,12.4448,0.1837,2.8015,0.246,0.0203,0.002,7.8929,5.2765,6.6934,2.3909,3.9307,1.4881,11.9202,0.4221,0.6828,0.1575,0.0003,0.8943,1.7067,5.7631,8.459,1.0475,3.3097,2.2407,2.8416,4.9433,0.3212,5.1546,5.9424,6.8938,3.9864,2.9226,2.4243,0.151,2.8349,0.0018,0.0011,1.7006,1.6999,7.8566,4.8106,7.4293,5.9314,0.0076,0.2528,0.5155,2.5997,2.4634,1.6864,8.0936,1.6607,8.0465,9.1521,1.4974,4.5519,5.1145,0.2882,9.4995,1.7066,4.2633,0.8825,3.9382,0.284,4.1549,1.1642,3.9671,4.0985,7.7314,5.1005,0.5938,2.0817,4.4286,5.2573,7.4963,0.0776,0.6539,1.3455,4.0276,2.4298,3.0349,4.8356,0.2849,10.445,5.5456,5.8187,1.2948,4.5506,0.0059,0.3626,0.001,0.0013,1.5037,2.1376,5.3263,1.4749,1.5914,6.5908,2.0498,0.1433,4.5527,0.8577,4.5739,1.0371,2.148,6.163,5.9972,4.4678,0.4586,1.3125,0.6593,4.7068,0.0397,5.2203,4.3406,4.251,1.6671,3.5603,4.2071,0.2113,1.7327,0.8774,2.7181,2.2464,6.3709,1.9446,0.4543,1.9428,1.8468,2.3383,3.1209,5.3425,5.8954,1.0637,0.963,6.1306,0.0963,0.7108,4.1455,2.3954,1.415,2.2585,1.2806,5.0126,2.8993,5.2281,5.1998,4.8613,4.8321,2.4523,2.6978,2.9524,5.0619,1.4637,5.9393,0.32,1.916,7.3624,0.5781,2.0205,3.4149,2.3161,3.1926,0.7286,1.3406,6.843,0.0334,10.0052,0.9033,1.6436,1.066,1.8556,5.3637,2.0701,3.1404,1.2511,5.0083,1.4239,1.0408,1.8268,3.0519,3.4062,0.8931,3.2612,3.4095,1.1887,1.6603,6.1895,6.729,3.5676,1.7496,3.0772,5.2838,4.6104,3.1456,3.6029,9.218,4.1306,2.9833,2.8886,2.7887,3.8836,4.7486,0.0244,0.3692,4.513,2.8583,3.6987,1.6201,2.2218,5.9241,3.7451,0.1382,2.347,4.7774,5.9886,1.6553,1.432,0.2781,2.4214,3.1564,0.0889,3.829,0.0016,0.131,1.5672,2.43,2.0558,5.8171,1.3236,0.3623,0.0709,3.2931,4.5962,4.581,0.9868,0.6778,3.5514,0.1478,1.3645,4.2024,3.82,2.3454,1.8108,0.2908,6.2994,0.8684,1.8102,7.8658,3.636,0.584,4.7397,1.0945,0.13,0.2747,1.46,4.1409,0.6115,2.1268,5.5014,3.4383,2.7061,2.854,6.8737,0.4685,2.5573,2.7716,2.8909,1.3624,2.3162,2.3425,0.0502,0.9421,2.2372,4.5446,3.6785,2.5483,3.2634,1.4817,2.0235,3.3549,1.3904,6.9325,0.4941,2.5692,0.0955,1.3053,7.67,6.4746,2.0292,3.1667,4.1435,2.4588,6.9178,3.116,0.4682,6.745,0.7844]}

From right to left, they were Mass\u00e9na with two divisions on the coast, Drouet with two divisions in the center and Victor with two divisions on the left. They advanced into what was to be the new province : Var. The French were divided, each attacking from their own rear. Thus Mass\u00e9na advanced into the city of Toulon, while Drouet advanced into Toulon proper. Both divisions were surprised by surprise ; Napoleon was on his way to relieve it.\nThe army was greatly superior in numbers and fighting ability to the French but they managed only to take one or two points. There was good food and a proper supply of fresh air. There were many troops from Italy and the Rhine troops were more used to the mountains and less familiar to the plains and muddy roads.\nVictor ( the other major army commander ) was not satisfied with the action in France and decided to attack the Emperor himself instead of continuing the campaign. The Emperor was very ill from the effects of heavy fighting. At one time Napoleon even had two doctors trying to save his life.\nSoon after the Emperor left the field, the French attempted to retake Toulon. They advanced in the direction of Toulon.

Since then, it has undergone two renovations due to structural issues. The attraction received the official nod from Walt Disney himself.The official name for the attraction is Millionaire's Row. When it first started, it was called The Mystery Wheel.At one time, the attraction used the original theme song from The Mystery Machine.The ride continues to showcase the theme of money and shows the main characters, a group of wealthy men, from a safe in a vault where they can play a simulated stock market game. At the end of the game, the guest's avatar as the wealthy man gains all the money left in the vault. In order to win the game, the participant has to be a millionaire. The ride was revamped to create four screens, rather than three screens. This allowed the fourth screen to be used as a background screen that was also used to show advertisements. A guest could go through the simulation of millionaires without knowing that they were actually there.A total of 28 attractions were at Disney @ - @ MGM Studios. The three main attractions of the park were The Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Wishes ( a Disney film music show ). The main attraction of the park was The Haunted Mansion because it had been in existence long enough. Since the new park came along, this attraction ceased to exist.","token_len":319,"entropy":[7.7347,0.2266,1.0675,1.9138,0.9043,2.8927,0.0233,5.2042,7.715,3.1765,4.8205,7.975,3.8235,8.1094,2.3676,1.2456,6.2711,5.0659,1.6123,0.1089,6.4181,0.0508,5.8131,11.7366,1.91,1.3006,7.9108,0.2218,3.5786,9.9058,7.4132,6.3278,7.576,2.9677,1.9458,4.1518,1.325,2.093,1.4375,4.5688,0.6225,4.0461,2.1934,5.101,3.0685,2.1059,2.8204,1.3854,3.2185,4.1028,0.9681,0.0014,0.2606,5.0806,1.1972,0.8633,1.0614,0.2417,4.9418,4.8257,3.8153,6.2953,0.024,7.0433,1.5979,1.4438,1.3162,5.2841,5.7373,2.7582,6.6565,6.0488,1.5526,3.1182,0.0109,3.5116,2.5513,5.4222,6.6787,3.7051,1.9213,0.5208,0.4947,0.9122,6.3737,0.0642,1.8674,6.3274,1.2459,4.9794,1.6844,2.8125,4.0507,1.6347,0.9393,0.3347,1.689,4.5743,8.4943,7.6375,1.2495,7.8735,2.8158,1.2718,0.5146,1.3979,1.2181,4.4619,2.5444,4.5615,3.0935,2.9084,2.6623,2.4505,4.5449,6.7764,1.6526,4.2171,6.0534,5.7478,0.473,7.8232,1.3583,3.2147,1.5572,7.1629,1.5297,7.2975,1.986,5.8738,0.893,2.9926,4.4327,3.3889,0.0818,3.8142,3.3824,1.3062,4.5222,2.4327,6.5494,4.3503,1.6553,4.7428,3.8089,0.5985,2.3118,5.73,2.652,7.8312,6.6098,0.2604,3.145,0.6269,4.7574,1.2603,0.9698,0.1197,0.3553,1.4358,0.2649,1.1907,7.6373,4.6323,6.6127,7.4204,1.8309,5.5413,0.5728,5.4355,4.7784,0.7018,1.1353,6.9387,1.9634,0.549,0.1253,0.7722,3.897,3.1701,0.0955,2.4685,0.9582,0.6278,0.1551,0.6348,7.2483,2.7248,0.0203,3.999,2.0403,0.4963,0.829,1.826,6.1848,3.157,6.5182,1.8516,4.628,7.0466,7.8093,2.1275,7.398,0.0388,1.8086,2.4349,0.9335,3.749,2.7168,1.2989,8.538,0.1835,0.2695,0.8421,2.0979,1.538,0.7661,4.7401,4.7562,3.8978,2.5004,3.958,0.8293,1.8504,1.7783,6.5829,1.4876,4.9156,5.4437,2.1776,4.5033,3.1169,0.711,7.0006,2.2402,8.1998,4.4524,5.0826,2.5787,1.1586,0.843,3.6985,4.4437,0.4728,4.6081,5.3927,0.0228,5.2287,6.0578,1.0643,6.3259,4.9162,4.5854,0.5679,0.4622,0.1287,0.2695,1.885,1.5159,4.6732,2.3243,0.4009,3.9633,0.9152,2.5518,1.071,2.9055,3.6093,0.0416,0.4937,6.9972,0.1242,0.0122,0.0006,1.2388,0.2501,1.5176,5.7963,4.2532,4.4882,5.4751,3.7154,5.415,8.8275,3.9598,1.4707,1.1409,4.0637,0.4447,2.2403,0.4738,0.1742,0.5106,1.901,2.4485,0.1419,6.3864,1.0257,2.6435,3.0764,3.3729,2.6853,5.2062,2.3046,2.6462,5.6658,1.593,5.949,3.2592,5.2588,2.7584,0.5384,4.824,0.7507,8.9845,0.3595,1.2031,0.7101]}

Callum McCall was also appointed the interim manager of Bradford by Neil Warnock following the sacking of Greaves on 12 September 2014. Callum McCall was appointed as Bradford manager on Monday 17 September 2014. His appointment caused an uproar from supporters, who blamed the club's board for not offering him a contract extension in the spring which would have kept him on until the end of the 2015\/16 season. Following the club's relegation to the Championship, McCall was sacked on Saturday 14 September 2014, after just 25 days in charge. Although Callum McCall was brought directly in to succeed Warnock, Bradford City board president Nigel Pearson called McCall a \"bad apples\". He said the club were looking for a manager because they were underperforming and were suffering from lack of results, after a \"very poor start to the season\".\nOn 15 June 2016, Callum McCall resigned as manager with two days to go in the league for a permanent replacement to be appointed.\n\nInternational career\n\nMcCall has represented Northern Ireland at Under-21 level and at Under-18 level.\nMcCall played in the 2005 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship and finished as runner-up to eventual winners Croatia.","token_len":320,"entropy":[9.5575,15.8977,2.9416,2.3468,3.8895,2.0714,2.3998,5.6116,7.741,1.0193,2.7578,2.7359,4.8223,0.4426,8.2661,9.9733,2.3076,2.1746,2.9051,2.1176,6.2477,0.319,2.164,6.8526,1.9982,4.1921,2.2048,4.0262,2.4122,5.9609,4.4807,10.2612,0.017,1.0606,2.104,5.014,1.9783,3.1275,0.0231,6.6798,6.4476,5.4109,5.9412,1.0016,7.3323,8.2705,7.3595,6.5126,3.6569,1.1262,0.6043,0.0025,4.008,0.3052,0.9945,1.7318,5.068,9.1705,0.3568,7.0834,8.8537,8.4209,2.0233,4.2543,3.5131,1.0414,2.5249,2.6232,2.0525,3.8701,0.7018,0.4301,9.4202,6.3611,3.5153,0.0801,1.7205,2.5576,3.8265,3.9619,2.9278,0.6662,1.372,1.6762,5.83,4.5788,0.8974,0.0005,4.9054,0.6704,7.2103,0.0204,0.2294,7.2063,0.0091,3.1305,3.5571,2.2489,4.5925,0.3098,4.6925,0.004,1.9629,0.0013,1.5917,2.3653,2.2591,1.3605,2.1369,0.9199,6.6589,3.792,1.809,2.1071,0.9469,5.5675,2.5947,6.8633,3.2776,0.9927,3.8826,2.5798,1.5142,1.1712,5.0464,1.2763,2.4869,0.7606,3.9317,0.57,1.5036,4.5309,1.2533,0.7733,2.9737,0.6532,3.3306,1.1582,5.6346,7.5708,1.8813,0.2698,4.0861,0.1779,1.7776,1.5577,1.1837,0.4204,0.0121,0.5323,3.6858,1.1078,0.0198,0.2032,0.1251,5.5031,0.9281,4.078,0.0746,1.9842,1.5975,0.491,0.2353,0.9198,2.2946,0.0025,1.2495,2.646,2.3445,3.9696,3.2198,1.069,2.1161,1.9071,2.3852,4.609,5.4015,1.7033,0.9696,0.2263,0.5202,5.6861,2.9301,0.0023,0.0933,0.0009,1.6337,4.8977,8.2171,3.6089,1.3635,3.56,1.6312,0.0008,0.9589,5.9154,2.7225,6.4796,3.1743,5.7892,3.5852,5.4331,3.5069,0.0023,2.2825,0.2834,4.4531,6.5834,2.2132,2.2632,1.3964,3.1299,1.9569,2.8771,3.9535,1.2356,0.6826,2.3434,6.077,1.7402,1.9818,4.3697,2.9561,1.7914,3.3139,6.6979,0.6779,4.8724,0.1231,3.7382,2.9956,5.8189,2.5325,3.8533,3.5691,2.7018,2.2245,0.8173,0.2107,0.1226,0.4665,2.3813,7.8685,5.0885,3.6829,3.0661,0.2244,3.2324,0.0036,0.0134,0.0012,3.1147,0.9408,3.0134,4.7296,5.4957,1.8923,0.9005,0.2453,3.302,1.1388,4.2224,4.9859,2.7038,8.1729,3.6813,3.1928,1.7653,1.4846,1.0808,2.1191,7.6782,9.9982,5.9989,0.5732,0.0001,3.0588,0.0004,3.2356,2.6037,5.7636,0.0502,0.8714,2.7607,0.16,1.3477,0.6734,1.7118,4.598,1.9887,0.0266,1.6718,0.0929,1.4471,1.6453,22.5249,0.001,2.404,1.9418,1.734,5.461,5.0049,2.9062,2.0279,0.0158,0.8515,6.2856,1.0675,1.6161,5.8786,2.207,5.6157,0.0864,0.0052,1.2988,5.8607,2.5839,4.7553,1.8551]}

There has since been only a slight increase in the membership, but the congregation has undergone a gradual revival.\nWhen the rabbi visited our village in 1880 he made some remarks in the synagogue on the subject of war ; he reminded us that for two years we had been in a warlike state, and that not all of the soldiers of the revolution had been patriotic.\nHe also advised the youth not to become addicted to hard work ; he was not satisfied with the work they had been doing ; he wanted more work.\nFinally he asked us to pray for the safety of our American army.\nOne young man among the congregation asked the rabbi, \" Are all Christians patriotic? \" He answered, \" Most of them, but not all ; not yet.\n'\n' I have spoken of the synagogue meeting, but there is not so much need for a synagogue as there needs for the meeting of the Lord's people in their respective homes.\nOur Methodist minister gives a Sabbath school class from ten to one o'clock.\nThere is also a regular class every Tuesday afternoon, and on Saturday morning there is sometimes a special service.","token_len":321,"entropy":[2.3156,4.8583,11.6958,1.504,5.2563,8.1413,3.4776,5.2288,3.3433,10.586,2.5083,1.6657,1.7284,6.9572,8.4988,0.6781,3.4553,0.7539,6.1029,2.6919,5.7593,2.4985,0.0568,4.9778,1.45,1.0752,2.4495,2.6042,0.8741,5.6297,3.0231,5.2055,6.9791,2.2109,5.323,5.1042,3.7368,0.3342,6.5888,0.6906,1.664,8.4246,2.4401,4.5851,6.4851,9.3594,0.9275,4.4843,0.7794,3.6198,2.0666,2.7459,1.0937,2.7765,7.5603,5.8816,1.1572,1.646,1.2087,1.1123,1.3759,2.1136,4.5338,0.0874,5.6967,2.8906,1.1151,3.5026,5.0268,4.0349,5.0207,4.1029,0.7204,8.5106,4.4594,8.0905,2.2793,3.491,2.7745,5.5293,5.1942,0.9346,4.233,7.4235,0.7211,1.5096,3.5491,3.4526,3.6397,3.4708,1.1412,4.7606,5.1596,4.2361,0.0789,3.9181,1.8643,3.5025,1.4462,0.3669,0.6037,3.814,1.3923,1.0262,1.3134,3.0765,1.313,5.7425,1.2183,3.2043,3.4572,0.6242,1.5292,4.9661,0.846,6.0801,5.3704,6.3383,5.7585,1.1637,4.4832,2.9163,4.523,3.4397,1.9155,3.164,2.1193,1.9237,4.2258,0.7505,2.8534,0.1727,8.679,5.9213,1.5614,5.7618,0.33,0.4519,5.5284,4.0759,0.8043,3.1449,0.4503,0.6663,2.8123,1.6797,1.7795,7.2246,1.5045,1.1534,0.7404,0.7436,6.2083,3.293,1.5273,1.4576,4.3561,2.7568,0.5911,6.0087,1.0471,0.9314,7.7195,1.0022,2.3631,2.8761,2.2301,5.6318,2.9714,6.8458,3.22,0.0102,4.4017,6.0735,0.0198,7.3131,4.0805,2.5568,1.2966,3.538,2.8306,4.5171,0.4263,0.8393,4.0047,3.4605,1.0962,1.9457,0.4267,2.5087,0.8041,3.4344,4.1067,3.5365,1.8091,1.3336,5.8056,1.8657,2.8723,1.2159,0.6644,5.265,1.3641,1.2242,4.4887,0.1239,1.2218,8.5855,5.227,1.4042,1.5154,5.0555,5.4952,0.6683,7.6022,1.0842,2.9151,3.4903,3.1463,0.9074,2.5402,0.4355,4.2955,4.9043,6.1177,5.9126,1.3892,0.9183,2.178,1.3584,0.5341,0.0424,5.8835,0.4706,0.7141,2.3481,1.8629,1.6386,0.4244,4.2104,3.8797,6.5049,2.0483,2.8094,6.8911,1.0376,2.7373,6.1131,2.8559,5.5194,2.0078,1.183,7.8236,7.7102,3.3233,1.6102,3.6553,0.9767,2.4335,4.8257,0.2271,6.9049,1.4094,2.4228,3.3281,1.7667,1.566,5.5802,0.5513,2.5368,5.9352,0.5315,1.119,5.8306,2.1173,1.2138,3.0502,4.3891,5.42,3.0076,0.3939,1.05,4.8289,7.9429,2.6812,7.77,2.0358,10.5724,7.1839,5.6879,6.0689,5.8902,0.6274,3.9915,6.0074,0.0072,0.001,2.719,2.0619,4.1475,0.8558,3.3781,0.4244,4.8589,5.699,4.3867,3.8165,4.1622,1.6094,1.6938,3.4535,3.5419,3.903,2.6332,0.4516,6.4205,0.3858,3.0777,3.8523,1.5779]}

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe , with the earliest","text":"Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, particularly in the English language. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest Irish translation of the Bible as far back as c. 500 AD. The major genres of poetry in Ireland include traditional poetry, epic poetry, folk poetry and modern poetry. Poetry in Irish was first written in the early ninth century by the monastic poet Gratian, who wrote poetry on a pastoral visit to a monastery in Northern Ireland and later translated the Hebrew Bible into Irish. The Irish epic poem Finnegan Lives by \u00d3lafur \u00d6rn Eyvind Johnson ( c. 1230\u201340 ) is an early example of the Middle Irish language. Johnson was perhaps the first literary figure in Irish history, and his epic poem was influenced by Anglo-Norman and Continental literature, and it became the most popular prose work of its era. The modern movement in Irish poetry was inspired largely by the works of John O\u2019Donovan, who wrote a number of important works, including a novel and a play, but mainly wrote poetry. The poetry of Se\u00e1n O\u2019Rourke, Sean Mhanna and others of the 1940s and 1950s was influenced by the Modernist movement in poetry. Modernism in Irish began in earnest with the publication of an anthology entitled Poems ( 1956 ). In the later 1960s, poetry began to flourish as a result of the influence of an Irish group of writers known as the Eirinn, which were influenced by the New Criticism and existentialism.","token_len":324,"entropy":[5.1855,4.1179,1.9246,5.7303,2.0399,0.1658,5.5353,7.765,2.6274,6.2947,2.2087,6.0528,1.2126,4.2752,1.0269,1.2356,4.788,0.6906,0.6028,7.9539,0.4114,2.708,6.2927,1.1679,5.8473,0.2619,3.0705,8.825,0.0056,0.0,5.9752,0.8739,2.562,1.0029,2.7301,2.2231,2.7318,5.6111,4.347,1.8172,1.614,3.9288,5.1623,4.5243,0.0399,0.0031,8.1071,0.0344,4.396,2.4206,0.5626,1.7578,6.213,7.5577,0.6864,2.196,1.0494,0.8182,1.6682,5.5186,2.6098,0.5133,5.7382,0.3203,0.1778,3.7248,0.7866,1.7987,4.3107,0.4402,0.2331,2.7202,0.2636,0.9471,0.9997,2.8891,1.7801,3.2035,0.3084,1.3347,2.3072,5.9076,0.0652,2.7504,1.7803,8.6638,0.276,3.8906,7.7223,4.6817,1.8053,1.3901,0.8416,2.6279,3.0005,3.3497,2.2374,5.4597,6.1258,0.2789,3.3061,1.116,0.6856,4.6477,0.0106,3.7384,2.355,3.0269,1.5362,4.6664,1.1108,0.4235,1.242,0.4467,1.7484,2.9876,7.7021,0.8423,7.9514,2.4947,0.0354,9.0995,4.5509,6.5161,0.1592,3.3293,0.4112,2.0206,10.8495,4.8621,8.9814,4.3625,9.6064,2.3991,10.3886,0.062,3.7442,3.272,2.7362,8.1124,1.1895,1.3328,2.7931,2.4619,3.1241,0.1086,2.4446,7.614,1.155,3.882,1.1619,2.6923,1.9834,5.8821,0.4812,0.591,5.4245,2.6433,1.5301,1.6281,2.1095,2.6233,1.5545,1.5271,4.5227,0.5325,3.2193,6.1849,0.2097,4.0813,0.0231,4.9864,0.0245,2.8253,7.5397,2.238,1.9601,1.9459,3.1774,3.8104,1.6431,1.9195,1.3035,5.0706,3.5037,1.0141,4.0803,2.4923,0.2397,1.8563,6.0236,9.0775,1.3294,0.3218,1.3924,2.7627,3.9274,5.7032,0.0589,1.1635,3.7667,0.0343,3.2085,4.3734,16.0134,5.9885,9.5641,3.1895,1.111,1.4578,2.2861,2.5456,1.7437,0.001,4.774,0.9855,2.3564,0.808,3.3784,4.1838,3.8198,1.2016,2.8094,1.684,4.4542,5.2764,5.8063,1.7185,2.3842,1.7658,4.1821,0.4411,7.2441,0.3913,2.2099,1.9017,0.5776,4.1094,4.9968,2.0392,8.1122,5.2126,6.9575,6.0354,0.885,3.4244,4.6577,0.942,8.0803,0.0733,1.1529,0.5051,0.0009,1.4599,3.137,0.4058,1.4685,7.2246,2.3821,3.0492,1.3094,4.6488,1.416,5.9819,2.4639,2.3645,0.8598,4.2875,1.1248,2.896,3.2907,0.479,1.4641,0.113,5.0545,2.6176,2.7642,3.388,2.4004,5.2064,8.4949,0.99,2.5523,1.8787,5.714,1.5641,0.033,0.7581,3.4319,3.0321,0.1911,3.5615,3.1347,0.7286,4.8492,0.0183,0.6706,4.7407,0.0258,5.6317,2.3431,6.6839,1.6851,1.7627,4.0222,0.0419,0.3629,5.6476,4.5479,7.0232,3.7442,2.8301,2.9868,2.7206,0.1785,1.0619,5.2965,7.8862,0.5,1.7651,8.2148,0.7309,1.8879]}

{"prompt":"During the last glacial period , and up until about 9000 years ago , most of Ireland was covered with ice , most of the time . Sea levels were lower and Ireland , like","text":"During the last glacial period, and up until about 9000 years ago, most of Ireland was covered with ice, most of the time. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Europe in general, was surrounded by the open ocean. The main feature that was changed from the ice age was the climate. Rainfall was much greater in Ireland during the ice age.\nBefore the last glacial age, most of Ireland lay to the south of the equator. When this climatic event took place, Ireland was to the north of the equator. This meant that there was more sunlight in the summer, and the temperature did not cool as much as it did in the rest of Europe.\nWhen the ice age took place, rain fell everywhere in the world. But Ireland became very wet.\nDuring the ice age, there was less rain in Ireland because the British mountains formed a barrier between the Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Because of this dry climate, Ireland was very barren.\nWhat did Ireland look like during the ice age?\nIn Ireland, the forests became very tall. The trees are about 60 feet high.

Afterwards, they are brought back to the ship for a quick bite, before boarding the ship again and sailing for the nearest port. After arriving, the players explore the town with their wits to thwart the goblin army in their goal of securing Targos and recovering the lost crown. The game ends with a boss battle against the goblin lord.\nThis version of the game has been redesigned in part with a new game engine. Rather than being an adventure with a linear quest, the game is now a turn-based strategic war game. The turn-based nature means that if you run out of materials you cannot build your town, while the strategic nature means that each player will need to place their mercenaries in the most appropriate locations in order to capture the town. Each soldier that the player summons will have their own attack abilities and will only be used by the player that summons them. In order to summon a soldier, an item called a spell slip needs to first be obtained from the town. Once that is done, the spell slip is placed in a table on the town s edge and the player then summons one of the soldiers to the table. The game also introduces a number of new items into the game. These include items that will restore the life values of the mercenaries and the players. In addition to this, it also adds some new items that will repair or replace a particular building, which will help to build up the player s group.","token_len":325,"entropy":[6.8795,5.3141,3.5104,2.4627,3.048,3.9802,5.2449,1.9453,5.2877,4.2965,6.4108,2.9812,1.5693,4.5903,10.5366,6.509,1.5006,2.7145,7.1308,1.2015,1.6748,4.9181,11.0403,4.7918,0.6735,2.3288,7.6192,0.0313,2.5826,2.6651,0.9457,1.0508,8.3099,2.1226,0.6855,5.5375,0.1912,1.316,2.4812,5.142,1.7585,0.3244,1.0405,3.6526,3.6674,2.0747,4.1239,7.9496,3.2286,3.0366,6.7647,0.8009,1.5354,3.8801,2.061,4.8871,3.5946,1.3943,5.3537,2.8502,0.4941,3.1457,3.3912,2.7471,1.2767,2.7364,5.593,0.4707,2.662,3.615,1.9402,5.8573,0.6463,4.6373,7.4476,0.4806,0.8923,1.8631,4.3761,1.3654,6.1456,0.8994,3.8782,4.2703,0.0342,2.6356,5.4507,0.8269,4.049,7.585,0.6361,2.6686,1.8434,0.9271,0.8862,1.9584,6.0033,1.0237,3.1021,0.6537,1.6139,4.2118,2.1126,0.7451,11.8386,4.679,0.6828,0.7605,0.2419,2.7108,1.1966,6.1222,2.886,5.0411,3.7599,2.5578,0.976,4.2433,3.3568,1.6904,7.1055,0.0156,3.0328,3.1486,5.7218,3.6586,1.5323,4.466,5.8255,1.5922,1.0033,0.9182,1.4571,3.7945,1.6593,4.1169,0.4931,0.0028,6.3825,6.5313,1.5303,1.2521,1.4241,6.7257,0.247,0.0055,4.6625,4.4372,0.5228,4.873,1.1856,4.4149,0.3848,0.0362,7.0803,4.3281,4.5064,3.6819,1.9913,6.2095,1.4928,5.3094,1.7621,5.0548,0.8247,0.67,0.5525,5.053,2.1331,2.4624,2.4334,0.5551,6.6198,1.2703,7.8509,1.4964,2.5134,3.061,4.0689,1.5055,3.0939,0.272,0.0569,5.1049,0.9562,4.4675,0.5716,3.964,6.2933,5.5372,3.9517,0.3971,7.5349,1.8282,1.2224,1.4205,0.3748,5.4877,5.1888,1.1648,2.9369,4.701,1.4239,3.9704,2.6443,1.2306,1.1277,2.1067,3.7707,0.3168,0.3231,3.3525,2.4111,0.0984,6.208,1.1535,1.9951,0.6332,4.7105,4.4073,4.0971,1.2511,6.3225,13.1848,4.1205,0.0265,8.0172,0.1309,3.5321,1.1395,0.8579,2.0736,1.9856,2.4929,2.8397,1.0345,1.5487,0.1011,0.7409,3.3777,0.6997,1.6014,2.5509,1.0874,1.9067,6.7926,2.4009,0.2586,3.8103,9.4668,8.5118,1.511,1.7206,0.9832,5.3749,4.3551,3.4675,0.5314,1.4202,1.9763,1.2281,2.6821,2.3447,0.7575,1.3453,3.6805,2.7588,2.7226,1.1969,3.6004,0.0106,0.9832,3.7718,6.0137,0.1241,0.2344,1.7599,2.4375,0.8446,3.9034,1.1427,3.1241,5.9552,1.5835,6.555,8.669,0.2075,1.2665,1.9255,1.6845,3.0049,6.79,3.0434,3.5244,0.523,1.1501,2.7649,0.3578,4.4742,1.3325,3.3963,3.5357,0.6192,2.3855,1.7089,1.146,6.0036,3.7993,2.9185,3.5778,4.8083,5.6428,2.4977,2.8852,1.4352,3.3878,3.0257,4.502,1.8592,0.8309,2.6625,7.488,6.4164,1.2542]}

One was placed in an integral five @ - @ port bow turret, while the other two were positioned up in the conning tower, one each above the bridge and the rear bridge.\nWhile his guns were effective when firing over water, they were vulnerable against attack from his bow. He was equipped with an internal propeller driven by geared diesel engines and was capable of speeding up to 9 knots from a zero. The propulsion system had two pairs of generators, a couple of large batteries, two pumps and a motor turret.\nThe boat also featured two twin torpedo tubes amidships.

Of 600 dads surveyed , a majority","text":"A survey conducted by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care to be far more important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority told how the money made by working during the day helped to pay the family for day care and other expenses. Many fathers also mentioned that a working father is viewed more favorably by their other children, especially brothers. A study published by the Journal of Marriage and Family found that fathers are more likely to get good grades, be physically and mentally healthy, be more physically active, be less likely to develop alcohol or drug dependencies, and have lower rates of suicide attempts.\nSo why don't more fathers become employed full time. One possible reason for the low numbers is that some men find it hard to balance parenting and work \u2014 or they just don't want to work, the survey found. However, many mothers are doing double shifts, or are working part time while attending college and raising a child, and that's more difficult for more traditional gender roles.\nMen are no longer viewed as breadwinners, and that's important to say \u2014 although most men still spend more than women, and a survey found fathers spend, on average, five hours per day in the house, on household chores and child care.\nThe survey also found that fathers are less likely to think of their work as being important; they reported higher job dissatisfaction than mothers or nonworking fathers.\nThere are also issues of child health, nutrition, and safety. Men tend to work in more dangerous, lower-paid jobs, and research suggests that fathers may spend less time interacting with their children.","token_len":329,"entropy":[10.0771,2.6807,0.4789,9.4558,1.9338,3.1835,6.6417,8.8109,0.3687,0.8376,3.4754,2.7834,2.2467,0.6109,6.8377,8.422,5.6932,1.8095,2.2907,0.0572,5.9302,0.3852,0.6993,0.4207,5.2547,7.6848,0.8942,4.6983,9.0619,6.744,0.7661,0.7521,4.3029,1.6757,5.5812,9.1591,4.3496,4.488,4.2263,5.1163,5.5377,7.1785,0.416,1.6631,4.2643,4.0529,1.8037,2.9702,4.0253,4.6196,3.7957,0.3663,2.3042,2.3327,1.3463,0.6175,6.1512,3.4524,1.7733,5.0005,1.7036,4.0308,5.8847,2.1669,3.3436,6.0685,2.421,0.7087,0.6968,1.3685,5.8935,0.9942,1.7996,3.4014,7.2656,1.4846,3.9001,3.4269,2.1269,2.4617,0.5263,3.7989,0.0276,2.6781,0.1196,0.3034,0.6229,0.0987,3.4664,2.6502,1.0887,0.2422,0.4999,4.9531,5.6179,0.4726,2.3681,3.2341,5.5049,3.4374,1.7715,2.1087,0.2237,2.8115,3.2481,4.0276,0.9055,0.4022,2.0872,2.7046,0.9062,0.0141,5.2421,4.9034,1.3558,0.3989,8.5841,0.2171,0.4539,1.8427,2.2503,1.6496,0.0018,3.7663,2.9435,0.4072,0.8202,14.5923,2.3048,3.4381,0.0004,4.2841,1.8784,5.0017,4.5357,6.585,0.6868,5.2698,4.5194,2.0087,1.2673,2.4526,1.4955,4.4324,4.1331,1.2485,0.5715,3.8694,2.3966,3.8592,1.159,1.682,0.0531,4.9513,5.4271,1.7019,2.1963,6.251,2.9479,4.9153,3.4297,0.6757,0.0006,1.3536,0.2386,2.2358,3.5523,4.8008,1.1098,0.7244,0.0619,5.2346,0.0254,2.7545,4.4932,2.726,4.628,7.4821,3.9061,1.9134,2.8157,2.2938,2.3053,1.4559,0.6987,4.0713,6.2443,2.7142,3.2554,5.3112,2.1362,1.2249,1.2417,1.7937,3.6225,1.6243,5.2068,2.9305,1.0628,5.1628,5.2492,6.9078,0.1433,0.7973,0.7438,6.3234,1.7786,6.2709,0.5519,4.0089,0.3205,7.7541,0.0177,0.0,1.3091,1.8957,3.4772,1.0369,5.0399,1.584,3.9608,4.9962,5.0782,4.4376,2.1184,2.953,6.212,1.8709,2.1188,5.2609,2.0679,3.0865,3.3722,4.9774,1.9492,5.3901,4.7132,7.3897,0.1629,0.0016,0.0116,4.6536,1.7508,2.3275,1.7877,2.6937,1.6576,2.8625,1.4265,4.2187,7.5476,0.8264,1.3226,4.5599,0.121,0.6648,1.0679,2.7584,1.8131,0.7404,0.3817,0.2452,2.8798,1.2666,1.9095,0.2253,0.4043,4.79,2.0202,1.5788,3.6094,0.3517,3.1448,1.9981,5.5582,2.3,6.0175,4.7746,4.3063,6.1329,2.5398,2.0674,3.7471,4.728,4.9738,0.6627,0.5668,1.2259,4.5285,0.8972,1.7409,4.2369,2.7903,5.5816,5.1415,1.3611,8.5935,0.6159,0.6205,4.2846,1.134,3.3287,3.8932,0.0264,3.5193,3.0521,3.2217,2.8635,3.8063,7.2204,0.4518,2.9912,0.4396,0.7546,1.5729,7.0064,1.5951,0.3346,3.3333,2.858,5.1031,2.5405,0.1145,6.3189,0.0261,0.2636,0.3326,1.6921]}

When he joined the band he found out that the frontman didn't really want to switch to a girl's voice and that his own voice was just a background of female singer.\nSince Layne wasn't sure what to do, he asked his friend Dave Navarro to record the song \"Rainbow To The End\" instead of Staley singing. For this song, Dave was invited to join the band, and now Layne could focus his energy on writing his own vocals instead of competing with Dave's. Later in that month, Alice in Chains signed with Epic Records with Staley writing and performing vocals throughout the remainder of the group's debut album.\nOne of Alice in Chains debut's biggest singles \"Love In Vain\" was featured in a horror film called Friday the 13th, where the character, Jason Voorhees, was introduced as an Alice In Chains fan. In April, the band recorded their first cover of Kiss' \"Guilty.\nA cover of the song \"Motherfucker\" from the movie is also featured in the soundtrack of the same name. Along with the initial songs, many other songs also appeared in the soundtrack.\nThe first two singles were \"Pyramid Head\" and \"Guilty\".

Commercial freight service continued until 1947 when the Burlington removed its freight operations from the line. Commercial passenger service lasted until 1966. In 1970 the railroad ceased operations. In 1972 the former tracks of the Nebraska Railway were sold to a group that created the Nebraska City and Omaha Corridor Railroad (later Metro Rail ). Commercial passenger service began again on the line in 1979. The last passenger train ran in 1986 at which time passenger service ceased permanently.\n\nLocation in Omaha\n\nThe Omaha & Burlington track crosses the center of Omaha, with the main line running in central Omaha north on Jefferson Street west to State Street. The old Burlington Railroad tracks run in a southeasterly direction in the southeastern part of Omaha, joining the main line at Washington Street northwest of Market Street southeast of Lincoln Street. Railroad tracks run from the former line near the railroad tracks south of the Lincoln Avenue bridge in the northwest near the Omni Stores.","token_len":330,"entropy":[7.5831,4.2414,10.4407,6.6125,2.8786,1.6843,9.1052,3.4995,0.1443,9.4344,4.4977,0.566,1.0833,8.2643,4.8134,8.1265,2.9062,6.0371,0.6149,11.2465,9.2391,8.1902,0.5761,2.9952,3.0965,11.7478,6.4304,4.6211,3.9861,2.1345,0.9198,5.0309,0.8646,4.4544,2.151,2.8677,2.2793,0.378,1.6144,4.9349,0.8324,7.8816,2.9986,0.1521,1.8237,2.3858,1.8549,4.1999,7.5446,7.7485,2.2687,0.6015,4.3867,7.3985,5.8259,4.0434,2.8537,1.1015,3.004,1.742,1.3148,1.9223,5.4847,1.3035,3.3509,0.8565,0.8577,5.3847,0.5564,3.959,1.421,0.2016,0.6792,0.4631,1.4496,2.2761,0.1511,1.3616,9.9519,3.4125,1.4818,1.3762,3.4046,1.8575,0.2224,2.14,2.4579,1.5107,0.9845,3.5854,0.5348,0.3622,4.9294,0.1953,0.1195,7.5681,3.3818,0.4195,2.2247,2.6364,0.1631,0.4381,3.874,1.6278,2.082,0.7473,0.1641,3.2376,0.9422,2.1355,3.3596,1.4197,1.7092,0.5346,2.165,5.6532,0.2998,4.6848,0.7525,2.5671,2.9039,1.2462,5.5681,0.4634,1.9283,0.4012,1.6179,0.7364,1.4802,4.1758,5.2005,1.0558,0.958,1.6027,5.188,6.8992,5.827,0.0033,0.1598,0.8371,8.7498,2.4164,1.5675,0.2659,4.1333,4.2843,0.9545,10.136,4.6009,1.8527,2.6705,1.9807,4.1682,1.1659,0.7088,5.8653,11.8003,1.7459,4.2374,5.2166,1.52,0.6019,0.8481,0.6717,7.0207,3.0142,0.4128,5.8921,0.5733,4.5901,1.7699,2.5,3.0563,0.6225,4.382,4.0416,2.041,1.2851,2.3688,2.952,0.5131,6.6322,8.2823,2.5981,0.0825,2.9746,2.9128,2.8638,2.8906,0.764,2.8549,3.9156,4.1249,5.6465,0.38,1.9881,5.7317,3.1433,7.3864,7.0268,2.6715,2.6766,5.4713,6.5837,2.8834,6.7714,7.8988,1.0375,0.1413,2.9048,4.2317,3.833,0.7201,2.475,0.3507,3.1597,0.5439,2.0849,4.5883,2.9104,3.1894,4.9245,1.1528,4.6207,3.9822,7.3537,0.4919,6.7426,0.2664,2.6979,6.4455,0.2488,0.7611,5.8604,7.4438,4.4989,2.258,1.0343,0.0079,1.2371,1.5987,1.0389,0.1463,5.9978,5.1129,0.9858,5.2306,0.6439,1.4451,1.6341,3.9794,1.6763,3.6894,2.8678,2.0462,3.8451,5.2756,0.3252,6.6209,5.1597,6.7183,2.0486,5.3417,2.3253,6.4976,0.4293,1.0329,0.931,6.2161,4.7643,5.3495,1.5924,2.8217,3.4211,3.1579,7.0968,3.7051,0.3517,0.0005,0.0037,0.5657,3.9742,0.9892,5.6714,1.0125,0.0049,1.9631,1.5634,7.6779,0.76,3.4733,0.5151,2.5242,5.4933,1.1766,6.6487,0.7257,6.7788,0.5053,6.7964,0.1106,3.3049,2.3055,0.4551,6.6034,1.8244,2.1597,3.0718,1.593,4.8028,4.4479,4.4377,1.4207,3.807,3.2001,4.3361,0.6995,1.3796,2.656,3.2597,2.7779,3.1243,1.2733,3.2345,7.3598,0.9959,8.323,11.5229,1.9903]}

After being rushed to a nearby hospital by a private ambulance, he was admitted to the hospital in critical condition, his life-threatening heart attack causing his doctors to stop heartbeat monitoring. On February 24, after an extended coma, he was in a medically-induced coma and unable to interact with doctors or his family. On February 28, he died of his stroke at the age of 41, in St. Mary's Medical Center in Houston. The funeral service was held the next day in Spring, Texas, where his family had been living for many years. His body was transferred to Houston the Saturday afternoon afterward for burial in a Houston cemetery.\n\nCarrera\n\nHis wife and mother of their four children, Lisa B. Johnson, was in the hospital at the time. She left the St Mary's Medical Center for six weeks, during which the family stayed in Spring, Texas.\nOn March 9, 2007, the Johnson family released a statement in which they asked that his legacy be preserved for posterity, not forgotten. There are still many Johnson related businesses in Texas. Many of them, however, are not publicly known and their names vary. The family would like to see the name Johnson family honored in every town he visited, and it has been confirmed that Johnson has received two state honors.\nJohnson has also been listed on National Historic Locations and on American Legends.  Many of his accomplishments, such as his three consecutive World Championships, are listed by the Guinness Book of World Records.","token_len":331,"entropy":[8.2658,3.6513,0.2683,4.5351,0.2756,3.9376,2.1831,8.413,2.9166,0.0573,0.4849,6.9118,4.7926,2.1148,6.3701,0.0476,1.7824,4.2335,3.1939,0.8753,3.5353,0.0179,1.1691,11.7281,8.0946,3.2671,16.3374,2.305,4.0823,3.0129,2.1166,0.1355,1.767,2.8423,0.1083,3.8018,2.4528,4.5495,0.6403,0.1893,1.0809,1.1716,3.4559,0.345,0.8477,1.5185,2.9178,0.8975,0.0516,2.1201,4.2609,4.3098,2.5991,0.967,3.0982,1.5084,4.3468,2.4525,7.225,0.0769,4.8797,11.0446,1.8399,0.7636,3.6885,1.1152,1.6138,0.0448,5.1131,3.6155,3.7841,6.0743,0.3532,1.6068,1.0102,5.6571,1.5675,3.6714,4.2381,0.371,0.0337,2.1723,5.0876,0.0059,6.8737,0.0666,4.6666,2.6497,3.2669,0.5497,0.7812,2.1723,0.8452,2.6229,0.0724,1.2537,2.1775,1.0478,2.3003,4.673,1.8264,0.7972,1.8092,0.002,4.0553,2.3776,3.4395,6.8122,0.0907,4.176,0.0866,3.372,0.0259,0.9823,2.1496,0.5672,3.1996,4.9844,3.242,0.9831,0.3663,4.9874,1.857,0.0879,2.3205,10.0256,2.3627,2.4679,1.5671,1.7003,2.732,1.445,2.9406,1.7992,4.2025,2.3275,3.6755,0.3377,0.1608,3.6246,3.0973,0.1649,5.0439,0.1981,3.2508,5.7671,8.4602,4.9496,9.5088,2.8025,0.6939,3.3729,2.7204,4.1135,0.6667,0.3391,1.5121,0.0085,4.9828,10.5904,1.541,4.1535,0.0003,5.824,3.2245,2.7062,3.6965,5.2539,7.4764,2.4148,0.1284,1.0292,8.5488,5.5482,1.5662,5.2783,0.5685,2.0198,4.1021,1.6565,1.9653,2.7546,0.2157,0.0294,2.4127,2.0661,5.6948,2.083,6.5678,4.974,0.0636,1.9739,0.0102,3.7736,6.7844,1.2398,2.0903,4.7981,0.0577,6.0428,1.6327,4.594,1.0896,9.3881,1.2433,0.2338,1.2543,2.298,19.1793,1.6527,3.2396,0.0383,3.0983,0.0612,2.6745,2.074,1.9934,5.6001,0.503,0.2324,2.8471,0.6347,0.2674,5.13,1.6437,4.3035,6.6728,0.2115,2.8153,2.7714,1.7768,0.0002,2.2018,4.9825,3.9914,0.2927,6.3661,2.361,3.8567,1.3278,9.6776,5.6844,6.8796,1.5401,2.3188,1.7956,4.8292,0.5038,1.3399,3.4518,2.9678,0.0058,1.4094,2.4096,4.9872,2.6719,2.4167,3.9488,2.4129,6.2034,1.6335,2.6215,2.2311,4.6593,0.2148,0.194,4.6626,1.3327,2.5943,6.309,7.4519,5.2401,2.0236,4.026,5.0251,6.6746,0.8476,1.503,2.0325,3.7562,3.5924,0.5333,6.4422,0.439,3.7882,3.1875,5.0323,5.037,5.8382,3.3517,1.8082,1.0068,25.4974,3.3467,2.8666,1.3806,3.6597,1.5865,5.3221,3.7205,11.4406,2.6395,2.644,4.7671,6.7027,1.8058,8.7108,10.3319,0.8224,0.9753,4.7538,2.5327,1.8715,0.0013,2.041,6.6117,5.2869,3.2486,3.564,1.1796,1.8586,3.402,4.8215,1.1933,5.2288,0.2373,0.0089,0.1179,0.0104,1.0094]}

Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through a greater awareness of their own physical abilities and to learn to overcome adversity through positive thinking.\nWith this in mind it is extremely important to ensure that the horse is both tame and well socialised; for these reasons some degree of training and guidance are normally necessary. At the same time it is important to understand that although animals with special needs may require some degree of guidance or training they will always learn as effectively (and with less stress) as able-bodied horses. The difference lies in the effort required by the trainers\/guides, as it is often the trainers themselves (not the animal) who require guidance. There are numerous studies which indicate that horses with special needs learn more easily, and this is certainly true at the more advanced levels of training.\nMany riders with disabilities have the great advantage of being able to train at home, using their dog, but horses offer the possibility of a more enjoyable and structured training environment and are a much more versatile therapy option.\nWe offer the following two therapeutic riding courses for those people with either physical and\/or mental disabilities and for those who are willing to be inspired and encouraged in the process. Both courses are conducted at the Royal Equestrian Centre with the horses available for use by anyone who wishes to benefit from the experience. We endeavour to have as many clients as possible attending these courses so that they may benefit from the experience. To do this we offer reduced rates of up to 50% off the regular course price.","token_len":333,"entropy":[3.4186,1.9546,1.6701,5.5214,6.184,2.3503,0.5501,0.7077,8.4816,11.1099,6.7365,0.9003,9.8293,1.92,10.4643,1.6751,9.9484,0.3202,0.0158,7.3056,1.9251,5.1058,0.8698,9.1983,1.3923,0.4959,5.1862,8.4949,2.1138,2.4267,4.8991,0.4726,4.3131,0.5767,3.9119,3.98,3.929,7.5592,2.826,0.3647,0.9485,3.2712,2.4173,5.24,1.3148,3.7745,3.9474,1.3517,5.1954,4.6259,3.6663,3.8602,4.0383,1.3974,1.4026,13.8957,3.53,1.0993,0.0026,5.4569,0.3744,6.428,0.1528,0.963,3.6383,0.2985,2.348,1.9958,0.9896,6.6237,8.0051,0.1463,3.8395,7.078,3.4258,5.4857,4.707,3.6651,1.6843,5.2752,9.2992,0.0075,3.5255,1.7315,5.8355,2.2498,7.0576,4.337,0.6844,5.983,0.9675,0.8524,0.0015,2.0692,0.1244,0.7255,0.6367,3.666,0.6972,4.9893,5.4592,4.1344,4.0121,0.6072,1.3899,3.5449,3.2347,4.2666,0.0031,5.415,3.7611,2.0156,3.2016,2.2167,2.3607,5.4582,4.6944,7.3361,7.6343,1.2591,2.5068,4.2368,2.7056,0.5105,0.0621,7.6216,0.9238,0.001,3.3362,0.6878,3.1808,6.3959,4.7226,0.2884,0.5931,7.4548,1.5826,3.2554,0.8245,4.343,6.2948,6.9284,1.7668,2.6603,2.6871,4.3194,0.5565,2.2641,2.2903,3.0886,2.9067,5.1496,3.4929,0.6043,3.3486,1.4792,0.609,5.5824,5.4884,1.4428,4.6881,0.8269,4.2525,4.9928,2.2883,3.2083,0.1344,1.8334,1.0613,0.2991,0.0338,4.5383,2.6978,2.4113,2.725,2.0575,3.8868,0.9277,4.5311,0.9763,5.0668,1.5317,5.3635,2.851,1.3102,0.7023,1.3206,0.4848,1.5301,4.3873,6.0914,3.6177,2.3663,1.9568,3.5397,5.8297,1.6771,0.3137,1.3766,0.3654,0.0271,3.2901,3.0224,3.288,2.0021,4.9795,2.2564,6.9229,2.2178,4.7444,4.9089,7.4176,2.4085,4.8004,0.4717,2.9924,2.5832,4.3162,1.617,6.6442,1.4589,1.1559,3.5439,2.6241,3.5448,3.6403,0.5249,4.1188,8.8782,2.3992,0.5827,1.3124,5.418,3.858,2.6372,0.4849,4.6194,6.3657,1.6926,2.6652,1.9493,3.0114,5.2515,0.6424,8.5323,2.3414,3.0017,1.8195,0.0006,0.0753,0.0869,3.159,3.9625,0.463,0.8826,1.3439,5.3577,0.0491,4.2112,6.9639,2.3387,4.7746,3.8451,1.7736,2.2564,0.7957,4.8661,1.3703,0.8841,5.3835,1.7322,1.1538,5.5136,7.989,2.024,0.0052,2.6526,5.1592,1.7759,3.3527,4.1336,1.589,4.2459,2.8351,3.6213,1.6036,2.1336,0.0668,5.3886,0.1437,1.4895,2.6646,0.3555,3.353,6.308,0.0655,3.9371,2.4125,0.4381,7.8974,0.4977,0.1107,5.9903,2.248,1.2282,2.8802,0.646,1.8205,2.64,2.89,0.1225,0.7931,1.7369,1.1752,5.1434,4.3969,1.5575,1.0762,2.4136,8.966,1.6668,1.6365,5.4784,0.0099,2.8875,0.5151,1.9786,2.0578,3.0039,4.2014,2.4904,1.0923]}

A. flavipes feeds on various plants, many of which are unknown. In Britain, it occurs mainly on holly and birch, and has a relatively wide host range, from Sweden to Norway, the Mediterranean Islands, North America south to Florida, and Australia. The species has a large geographical range and is abundant in some areas, but seems to be rare or absent in others. I recently found A. flavipes on a beech in Scotland as well as the usual beechnut specialists, A. cuspidorsus, A. amabilis, and A. laevis. An unusual beetle for the type species of the genus is Amylostereus albigus from Switzerland and France.\nAmylostereus flavipes (Burch ) (Fig. 5). The fore wings are strongly brownish, the postmedial stripe is black, the base of the fore wings is strongly pale brown and the distal margin is strongly reddish brown.

The first political party founded after the collapse of the Socialist bloc, the Liberal Democratic Party of Croatia (ODP), was founded on 1 December 1989. It was founded by members from different political parties, which were banned by the Communist regime. The party soon became the first party of opposition; it dominated Croatian politics throughout the early 1990s. Under the leadership of Dra\u017een Er\u017ei\u0107, the Opposition League dominated politics. ODP was able to win the power elections in 1990, but was dissolved in 1993, and a Croatian People's Union was established. The ODP was resurrected in 1994, after the collapse of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, with its headquarters in Zagreb. The government of Croatia declared that it would open negotiations with the political parties from 1991. During the transition to democracy in Croatia, there were many political parties, some of which had their origins in the Communist era but had been officially re-registered for political activities such as political parties. In addition to the political parties in general, other political parties started to exist in 1990 or 1991. The Croatian Democratic Union and the Christian Democratic Party were established in 1990. In 1991, the Croatian People's Party was registered. The Serbian National Party was created in March 1991. In the elections of 1991, the Serbian Democratic Party won 9.2% of the seats in the unicameral Parliament, followed by the Liberal Democratic coalition in 6.7% of the seats.

The reason Comcast claimed for blocking HBO Go was that most consumers use devices that have either no network connection or are connected to a weak Wi-Fi connection.\nHowever, in the summer of 2018, the content streaming platform Netflix announced that their subscription service included HBO Max. As of September 2018, nearly half of U.S. households have had access to HBO Max. The service offers exclusive original production content from HBO as well as content from Warner Bros. Films, CNN, Turner (which is now a part of AT&T), Warner Bros. Games, CNN, and CNN Studios.\n\nCriticism by critics\n\nAs with all other media, criticisms of the Internet and digital content consumption have been leveled. Some have criticized the Internet for its potential for \"genocide\" or for \"erasing memories of the past.\" Many people also express fears that the lack of cultural influence over the Internet and social media can lead to violence and discrimination because of the difficulty of control over misinformation or propaganda. Critics argue that the Internet can increase information inequality, leading to \"one-size-fits-all information.\" They also note that the media industry relies heavily on advertising revenue, and the Internet provides a free environment for advertising. The authors of A Ghost in the Machine argue that the Internet and digital content consumption are creating a new way of \"poverty\", and they argue that the way in which society consumes content should be governed by its users, rather than the providers of content.","token_len":334,"entropy":[7.3962,0.1948,7.8173,3.3503,5.2923,0.4208,2.1595,2.4472,0.0681,11.6491,2.3189,2.9641,0.0372,5.3062,1.791,3.4357,6.2083,1.8772,1.3147,6.7666,2.3981,1.7913,3.4269,5.8504,8.9128,3.1996,6.3572,1.2683,8.4003,6.6626,0.71,1.9092,3.8917,1.3193,4.1584,0.1925,2.3801,6.202,4.6361,7.2106,5.2655,1.6143,2.4749,0.132,1.0552,1.0868,6.4922,3.8217,4.7346,5.1356,1.0916,2.3256,5.02,2.2132,4.0399,1.7632,0.3759,2.4132,2.2041,0.9625,1.2072,7.3954,3.3016,0.0039,0.0003,1.0545,0.4328,0.8938,16.9089,0.0212,2.8961,2.355,5.0797,0.064,5.9265,0.1137,2.1009,7.3318,4.7823,3.707,3.1921,1.0917,0.8264,4.516,4.7733,0.7307,7.3062,1.5128,12.3734,1.9184,3.9472,1.4478,3.4487,1.3463,0.0359,6.1445,2.31,0.1299,3.6724,0.0011,0.002,0.0327,0.8442,1.7737,4.3786,1.9337,0.0218,0.5584,2.9559,1.2061,2.7644,2.841,4.2732,5.7115,5.7739,8.6408,1.6326,3.1364,2.0608,4.4898,0.0636,0.0159,4.0786,0.7397,5.2044,0.1397,0.7622,4.8581,1.0255,6.4984,0.4419,4.3409,5.6134,2.7548,1.951,3.467,3.508,3.6714,0.0802,5.3412,0.0024,0.0002,0.4179,4.1154,0.1911,0.3296,6.7898,0.4167,5.1105,1.0288,1.6149,3.2575,4.1933,0.3862,0.8193,4.883,8.5873,0.3141,4.5693,2.9024,1.8226,0.0002,4.0577,3.2574,2.4925,4.0329,3.6608,1.272,5.2311,1.053,1.3443,5.0367,3.0747,5.321,2.9073,5.8141,2.2995,1.3477,4.8484,3.1196,3.2358,1.8266,2.9558,0.6854,4.1634,1.3206,2.2452,6.2995,1.5244,4.4388,8.3012,1.5429,1.0655,2.2256,2.0668,3.1372,9.0438,2.7898,5.9879,1.1064,1.9302,0.4981,0.8554,4.3129,3.7033,3.2083,5.3403,5.1521,1.0911,0.991,4.9012,0.0018,6.7743,4.3243,3.1088,1.0897,0.6513,2.8106,4.5004,0.152,2.8234,1.1683,0.1378,4.2185,1.2943,4.277,6.1545,0.3937,1.7428,8.0791,0.5307,8.0603,0.9286,10.0863,2.9055,5.5538,0.2413,4.3493,3.9527,0.0801,1.0734,1.3362,2.6507,5.7768,4.9361,5.8677,1.5347,4.246,0.1026,3.5089,6.6064,0.7251,1.7691,0.1138,0.0001,0.0695,0.0008,4.1488,4.0957,3.649,0.765,3.2421,0.1959,1.4949,4.0566,3.4926,4.5523,1.0387,0.0315,2.5336,2.366,2.091,1.7273,3.041,2.592,3.6029,1.7323,4.3161,4.8584,0.3509,3.86,1.3378,3.6412,6.434,1.0835,6.1704,8.4085,1.2335,0.301,1.2456,2.4185,0.0845,1.1668,1.5023,3.1365,2.5318,0.742,0.5626,1.8169,4.0545,1.0839,2.6807,4.8472,0.3383,4.2647,5.5828,4.2023,5.2181,1.7046,3.1234,1.839,0.0822,1.4321,4.8189,2.6778,0.0025,4.9838,4.6994,2.9246,3.6848,0.388,6.7956,0.1305,4.2828,4.9703,2.6946,1.5645,0.0082,2.0994,6.613,1.7126,2.3352,0.2477]}

While he had little experience as a skier","text":"As a young adventurer, Fossett was one of the first participants in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a skier, Fossett decided to participate in the 1987 Worldloppet. He was the youngest person to finish the race, beating a field of more than 700 participants. This was an experience as novel to Fossett as a college student would be, given the age difference with his participants. The next year, Fossett made the most ambitious event to date, the 1992 Worldloppet, which included an extended cross-country skiing segment of nearly 1000 miles.\nFossett returned to the sport in 1996 to participate in an event in Sweden. During a downpour, Fossett decided to change socks and his ski poles, which had seen better days. When he got out of the saddle he noticed that only half his feet were glued to the pedals and he found himself hanging on for dear life as the bicycle sank. But he remained upright and at the end of the stage, he received a medal for completing the race.\nAnother attempt in 2001 proved to be equally dramatic. As the race neared its end, Fossett noticed that his ski poles were missing. He thought he could still complete the race on his hands and knees, but found himself having more trouble than usual. Unable to walk, he crawled along the side of the course, with the aid of a skier. In a way, Fossett is now a skier, rather than a bicycle racer. While bicycle racing is the sport he loves, it does lead to some life threatening mishaps.","token_len":335,"entropy":[3.2258,5.7784,8.039,0.4181,13.4454,6.2505,1.7329,4.4337,0.0472,0.2378,1.9222,7.16,0.5485,0.584,5.0691,18.4261,3.4109,3.335,1.4527,3.593,0.057,6.2983,3.2781,3.8283,8.0391,0.003,0.0012,3.7542,0.5971,0.745,0.4597,4.6103,1.8684,2.6719,4.5151,1.0244,3.8245,0.2234,1.6595,0.0077,0.2675,2.5868,0.0008,5.4123,0.1482,3.8481,0.58,0.4051,8.8921,1.3826,2.3757,0.0028,2.1292,1.8797,1.734,3.2678,2.3124,3.1701,0.3894,4.0368,0.8045,1.1457,1.118,5.5444,3.4187,5.9666,0.3249,4.5346,0.0123,4.8876,2.6704,0.6783,4.4734,1.5093,3.6088,5.2678,6.1667,11.2488,3.6628,1.7593,0.0012,0.3969,4.0971,7.0001,1.6979,4.9879,0.182,2.0992,6.1137,1.2714,4.6531,1.7933,5.8445,1.9906,9.1321,0.3125,3.0391,3.7594,0.9063,0.2809,1.346,0.0008,4.0855,1.5112,4.797,8.2494,4.468,3.1273,0.5441,0.7924,0.9615,4.6666,0.6,0.2846,0.0018,0.9333,1.8883,3.373,3.2779,5.7695,4.0868,2.4665,0.0037,1.4428,6.4295,4.0032,4.6736,4.7457,1.6932,0.7042,1.7119,8.7272,0.0237,0.0003,6.063,0.2009,1.093,4.0346,1.095,2.5602,2.3299,3.7356,0.1814,3.9375,3.0865,3.1638,5.4662,2.0417,3.6776,3.3306,9.1007,0.5616,0.7283,2.4685,0.001,4.6241,0.1115,5.9714,7.3109,1.4369,5.0646,4.1662,5.4879,2.5319,1.9333,2.371,6.2909,5.0443,0.0428,1.5608,4.0828,0.9018,3.1176,3.392,0.3778,0.4319,5.2191,3.5175,2.5493,1.0715,6.7225,3.9021,2.851,3.4905,0.5232,7.1779,0.6433,0.4948,4.2706,2.7314,1.7971,4.4543,1.4316,6.1674,1.4557,2.8142,0.2676,0.0088,3.5535,1.7442,7.7157,7.4705,1.8049,4.9992,1.8509,5.9605,3.0645,1.0836,5.5713,1.3339,1.591,0.1355,0.198,5.8412,0.9079,1.0417,4.762,0.6724,5.2546,1.7971,5.4463,0.5487,1.2635,0.4999,0.9008,5.9342,6.9239,3.462,4.517,4.1304,0.9428,0.0169,5.4526,6.3528,0.7857,3.848,1.2619,1.9953,3.1911,0.0,0.986,0.5482,0.1612,0.8217,0.0016,4.6143,0.8569,0.9031,3.6931,0.2797,0.6303,3.4187,1.0288,0.9761,4.682,1.7782,2.734,4.5241,3.908,0.3083,0.256,4.1044,0.5956,6.4075,0.8658,0.2019,0.8446,0.2573,4.1283,1.3201,4.4829,6.4392,1.0713,2.5016,2.541,1.1417,5.8493,0.0011,4.2193,1.1712,0.4234,5.8273,4.3319,0.566,3.8196,0.0605,0.3294,3.0967,1.4017,5.0009,1.8595,1.6031,0.0012,0.9926,5.0284,0.4616,1.9032,3.8572,2.2886,5.5932,0.1657,3.2232,0.0018,3.8137,3.942,1.8839,5.5092,0.0085,1.153,6.1033,0.0347,0.2441,5.713,2.2562,0.5046,4.8625,8.2838,1.0168,1.1493,3.8787,2.0662,2.4957,1.628,0.9812,2.4309,3.9341,7.1475,0.2179,2.6769,7.885,4.4611,5.6382,0.0101,0.6115]}

The dam on the Nam Theun River, planned to be finished in 2011, is due to be completed, despite the fact that no Thai government has yet signed a memorandum of understanding with the Burundian Government.\nThus the only viable route for Thai boats to reach Burund remains the Simao River, albeit with a number of formidable obstacles to overcome.\nIn the early'80's, a Thai government - based study in Myanmar estimated that the cost of construction of the new Simao dam ( to supply electricity to the Burundian industrial areas ) would be about 10 billion Baht. A Japanese Company, however, proposed to pay Burundian officials half as much if the power generated was sold to Thailand ( in the form of a \" loan \" ). In the end, the price rose to 15 billion Baht, a figure that has never been reached. In 1995, the Japanese'loan'contract was signed and the dam was constructed. It has a storage capacity of 12 million m3 of water.","token_len":335,"entropy":[8.6878,0.1934,6.5085,2.1999,0.3135,1.896,0.1797,1.6082,13.5821,0.1593,1.2832,5.0616,3.781,0.161,1.4104,5.1663,3.8959,0.0584,6.6531,0.9906,1.0961,9.2053,11.3991,7.1149,3.6664,7.8122,2.3338,1.9628,3.1546,1.1568,4.379,0.6544,6.7746,2.5641,0.0227,4.9337,3.8,1.6774,1.1122,0.0022,0.4621,2.8981,10.7051,4.746,5.1986,7.3451,4.3771,7.3469,5.1403,0.0203,4.221,5.5303,3.0969,2.2271,5.4691,4.6264,1.064,7.0938,3.2751,4.7643,0.0095,2.2478,2.8137,0.5678,5.8248,3.3051,1.6829,0.342,2.2326,0.9315,1.9001,1.4711,3.1181,0.8841,3.6857,1.2204,1.5396,2.6981,4.575,2.6353,15.372,11.0193,6.895,11.8016,4.4475,0.89,1.5623,4.8324,4.7965,2.0803,0.1004,5.19,0.0026,2.5485,4.999,5.204,8.2996,3.1904,2.0725,3.2198,1.3923,1.9744,7.6293,5.5225,2.3134,0.2877,13.5474,8.4528,4.0599,7.1937,8.2845,6.3343,6.9158,2.458,6.9732,3.6417,11.1484,6.2728,2.0763,2.3831,5.3357,4.4672,0.5925,6.7532,1.442,5.0272,4.8963,0.5926,1.5931,4.5987,4.6414,0.4551,6.8988,0.451,0.0106,1.6696,1.8191,6.243,1.2031,1.6169,4.7044,0.7473,3.1723,0.1327,2.2831,3.8829,0.0757,1.0301,0.8748,5.154,5.4598,1.5008,1.6704,0.0799,4.0901,5.7441,1.5188,0.9107,2.1958,2.8034,1.3531,3.4839,0.2507,0.0432,1.295,0.5125,4.5701,0.0188,1.2677,2.2296,1.6022,0.9234,7.2906,2.4693,5.8098,3.8608,2.5899,1.5671,4.525,5.4323,0.6984,1.21,4.5845,0.0003,5.7157,1.124,8.8533,5.5094,1.658,1.1673,6.7048,1.4885,1.5721,4.9147,0.0223,8.6913,0.7238,3.5065,2.7551,0.307,1.2661,3.1927,2.1939,3.4649,12.0914,2.931,2.8647,0.3033,2.5977,3.705,2.3263,7.9397,4.473,14.1774,2.9664,5.2299,8.8077,0.8184,2.0585,4.6088,0.3275,2.3102,1.2383,0.7941,3.9673,3.1609,0.0381,2.4258,4.5315,7.6785,8.1111,5.5505,0.6799,1.6766,3.021,0.0057,0.2153,6.9582,3.3925,2.1108,1.3299,0.7286,2.6374,4.3142,1.4405,6.759,0.3383,1.936,4.0038,7.4916,6.8244,1.5771,5.5246,0.05,5.1464,1.5718,3.8285,8.5678,0.0026,0.3893,3.8712,5.5879,3.8001,0.0055,5.1646,1.1769,8.1236,5.8219,2.7344,4.0035,0.9318,2.4948,3.6629,5.5175,2.111,1.7523,0.0051,2.2736,3.5758,7.6983,2.3016,2.9559,2.7415,2.2282,1.9738,0.1582,0.9562,5.2293,6.2689,0.4862,3.3315,0.5247,0.1869,0.0014,1.4962,3.3549,1.7838,0.8994,3.3195,2.6646,0.1963,3.5037,0.8893,2.9844,5.2804,0.1577,1.1589,3.6853,8.6978,10.9714,0.1447,7.4027,10.672,2.0056,2.2987,2.671,1.0831,3.5193,0.7997,3.3976,0.7216,3.3062,3.0466,3.5987,8.1553,0.0718,0.0699,4.0714,1.7353,3.9252,0.736,4.7955,1.0499,1.4879]}

There is a moving sidewalk on both sides of","text":"The station for the roller coaster is quite different than traditional stations. As the train enters, it slows down but does not stop. There is a moving sidewalk on both sides of the track, much in the way of an amusement park ride. The sidewalks actually move with the train. This sidewalk gives you an excellent view of the roller coaster. It also acts as a sort of safety rail for you, not to miss the roller and end up in the tracks. The train pulls into the station without having to stop.\nAs it leaves the station, the train speed increases and then, once it arrives at the end, it stops. The top of the roller coaster is very low, so your view of the sides of the roller coaster is almost all of it, not a front or back view. The station is the same as the stations of conventional roller coasters, but if you step outside the station of the Roller Coaster Station, you will be able to see, but not touch, the train. There are no moving walls, doors or tracks. Although, the ride itself, is very different and much, much shorter than traditional roller coasters. It only lasts a few seconds, so you really have to act fast to enjoy the ride.\nThere is quite a lot of information on the site. Check out the info page for more details. There were four different variations of this amusement park, so it could be fun to take a trip to see how the stations would compare. And, you could take the train to and from the park as well. I would love to visit this place! See the video below for a preview of what the station looks like.","token_len":336,"entropy":[9.2323,6.8357,1.5766,11.1316,0.9295,2.4844,6.6315,3.2318,2.2405,7.0753,4.9731,0.988,4.624,2.1869,3.5757,3.6024,3.0236,1.5263,5.4141,0.4743,5.0423,3.048,0.2947,0.7391,0.5912,3.3915,0.7956,1.0581,7.3813,8.0066,2.8661,3.2931,0.2374,0.5988,0.0551,1.475,1.6831,6.3838,7.0251,0.2063,0.992,0.9988,3.5308,3.7823,0.0324,3.6626,0.4881,1.5116,6.3212,6.688,3.7942,3.5843,0.25,0.4808,1.9047,3.3585,7.5433,4.6251,2.4362,2.0243,4.626,0.4646,0.2527,0.2655,2.8904,0.0684,1.317,2.7733,2.1994,5.4401,0.1227,0.2796,4.3553,0.0084,4.1728,5.9068,1.9851,3.8308,2.6102,4.8539,1.6006,9.777,1.6125,2.7713,6.7139,7.1223,2.1844,1.5164,1.0748,5.8276,0.5465,2.0452,3.4476,5.3493,2.5007,0.6785,1.3191,5.3657,3.8149,0.0818,1.6896,1.128,1.5468,8.0023,3.6752,4.8766,0.5855,0.4022,0.3235,1.2161,1.4088,6.0618,3.0017,1.9728,3.7341,4.5988,2.5428,0.9133,3.7617,0.9088,0.2299,1.6073,2.0693,1.0909,1.4443,0.6962,1.7316,6.7916,0.9607,0.069,2.3999,0.0953,1.273,3.295,4.3007,1.5063,1.9766,5.1323,2.4938,0.7264,0.511,7.824,0.7557,0.0899,2.2415,0.1596,0.6908,4.5577,4.8844,2.928,3.8223,2.927,3.883,3.1142,8.3629,3.5471,0.5065,0.3737,0.35,1.469,3.5724,1.4795,4.5792,2.2003,1.1475,1.5287,6.4544,3.3951,5.6817,0.8066,2.0531,0.0013,0.9484,1.1583,6.0573,0.2191,5.8568,2.8928,1.7675,0.9116,6.1451,0.8549,4.9059,0.6032,0.0112,5.7548,0.7292,0.6323,1.0046,2.2749,2.4188,0.0161,0.3521,6.6059,3.6262,1.0824,3.8765,0.2921,0.3886,4.3469,0.9702,3.3554,0.8658,1.8443,5.2441,5.045,1.7334,5.2015,1.1278,3.5404,1.4202,5.9949,2.351,1.8226,4.0171,3.0883,4.4922,2.9504,1.8587,3.7984,4.6532,3.4263,4.4886,0.0261,5.7122,0.3881,2.3237,0.2249,0.5012,0.0185,1.4293,2.5915,5.3558,4.2791,2.0343,0.6102,1.3766,1.3053,1.9942,1.1021,4.8627,1.861,0.4765,7.8311,0.8404,1.1112,3.5382,0.9685,0.4635,0.2132,0.8614,3.1375,1.1844,5.4507,0.1449,1.5771,0.3798,3.4639,1.8628,0.587,3.8993,1.5142,4.7232,0.975,0.6529,5.4575,1.7442,1.2724,1.29,2.2469,0.563,2.8834,5.9218,5.3526,1.9448,6.7974,0.4731,2.8922,4.525,0.1263,2.6572,2.9036,2.7288,3.9074,0.6222,6.1134,0.3212,3.6842,1.2286,3.2891,1.4787,2.3921,3.8985,1.8625,4.5568,5.5621,5.0722,0.8905,5.3054,1.6492,3.536,2.3925,3.9263,2.1103,1.2696,1.4982,4.3429,0.0936,0.5431,2.9634,3.9483,0.5937,0.5512,3.5343,2.3176,3.1542,0.1063,5.2719,2.1479,2.2467,4.2228,5.8692,3.2176,3.9763,1.7051,1.3205,1.0976,4.9109,0.6622,2.0592,1.9226,2.4313,1.4483,0.0022,1.0323]}

{"prompt":"The Qur 'an mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of God . Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God , who then worshipped God only","text":"The Qur 'an mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of God. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only. This is how He gave them as examples to Abraham.\nThe above is how Abraham and Jacob had a close relationship as brothers-in-law and the relationship was blessed by God. They served God as best as they could. The following is an illustration.\nAllah ordered Abraham to give the flesh of his sons to one of his servants as meat offerings. Jacob came to Abraham and said to him \" I do not want the flesh of my sons to be taken as meat offerings.\" Abraham told Jacob that no meat from my sons should be taken as meat offerings, as God has commanded it. But my sons' wives should be given as meat offerings. Thus Abraham paid all the expenses of the slaughter of the slaughter of his sons, taking the meat of the flesh as the offering due to God. Abraham took care of the meat of the three men (the meat of his sons) with special care, so that there would not be any scent. As a result,the meat was fresh.\nLater someone came to Abraham and asked him as to whether he had bought all meat for the offering from his sons. Abraham did not tell the truth. The person came back and asked why do you not have meat for the offering from your sons? Abraham said that the people who have been sent to do the offering are very good and have brought all the meat they had which they were obliged to give to the offerer. As a result,the person who had come to hear that went away happy.","token_len":337,"entropy":[11.8431,8.4683,1.7497,6.0835,10.5415,1.8734,1.7947,2.8621,1.9393,3.3493,4.8955,0.7308,4.4306,0.6796,1.0123,2.9776,4.4094,4.8177,1.6463,3.568,0.9016,2.3582,11.2099,2.475,2.8414,2.2138,6.6741,1.5792,0.646,1.9888,4.3864,4.2806,6.9752,2.1586,6.9929,2.8679,3.0511,1.1394,4.7058,5.2018,4.5209,1.817,4.2376,7.3607,1.7594,4.0589,1.7054,1.2684,5.9636,5.3369,1.9734,3.5142,3.1513,2.5433,2.2059,4.663,2.087,5.1908,0.452,3.5903,2.5919,5.2073,0.1308,0.0067,0.4905,2.1622,3.7621,5.1711,2.3026,7.2635,1.5386,0.4007,0.656,4.1488,6.8638,2.5334,2.3263,4.2813,2.3067,0.7762,0.0796,1.4601,2.8017,3.8126,0.7812,2.187,3.9286,3.7861,0.4833,6.2892,6.2284,0.8748,0.5375,3.2835,2.7706,7.5516,1.4654,1.1528,3.3258,1.1277,4.9847,0.2522,0.8863,3.4293,3.1085,7.0104,9.9467,1.0854,5.9187,5.791,0.7367,1.4243,0.9526,1.3536,1.9451,0.1253,2.6926,7.9963,3.5063,0.0748,1.7158,3.4589,0.3785,0.1216,1.3644,0.3391,0.8211,0.51,3.253,2.2836,0.6681,1.5337,2.1983,0.9463,3.6962,3.5934,1.5615,6.0178,2.4424,4.6154,6.0708,0.4124,1.761,0.2607,1.0095,0.6478,0.4505,0.4056,2.0822,3.2896,4.4745,2.4833,1.6735,3.6296,0.6665,4.891,8.4945,0.8285,5.4556,4.7106,3.9226,1.4611,1.0575,1.1273,0.4311,0.1009,1.1976,4.9612,1.4844,6.055,5.0842,1.2308,4.7374,0.8647,1.4863,6.0918,1.2433,2.065,5.7306,2.4995,1.1955,0.4054,1.8927,5.5528,2.2896,1.4208,1.4844,1.8076,3.9436,2.708,2.6573,2.7915,7.5413,0.6652,1.2246,0.4616,2.903,3.6614,4.7556,0.6608,1.0634,2.9524,1.4293,1.2437,6.2046,4.8842,4.0008,2.8855,5.553,0.4766,3.0853,0.5412,1.0227,4.2144,6.1296,0.3167,1.8144,2.9132,0.4273,4.5895,1.2859,1.5328,0.0573,0.4162,10.2262,4.0406,4.4969,1.7249,0.808,0.9013,11.454,1.1823,2.3285,6.878,2.1468,1.2254,6.1307,8.907,3.365,0.3463,0.5544,0.5408,1.8386,0.3811,6.5169,0.4427,2.3604,0.4828,1.7733,4.9192,4.3956,5.8882,2.8502,1.3027,5.4024,4.4331,1.8695,1.4554,0.4776,0.4086,4.9077,0.0799,3.5688,2.4728,3.855,1.716,2.2489,2.372,4.5121,2.363,1.1715,1.788,3.839,6.8638,0.8175,2.4769,2.561,1.6434,1.2364,0.5074,0.1651,1.0195,0.484,0.1327,0.4381,0.5939,1.3281,1.4325,2.5372,2.8844,2.786,2.9866,2.8713,3.9433,1.0964,5.5145,1.2551,1.3865,2.3567,5.5573,2.8697,1.2558,2.9259,3.7757,4.0242,0.8359,2.0557,2.4977,1.8214,6.9305,1.4491,4.016,5.6765,0.0195,1.9644,0.7703,1.1674,10.4983,3.9027,0.4566,4.2023,0.8373,0.2731,0.5827,5.7806,3.09,3.9382,1.0148,3.8025,0.9142,6.1017,2.9936,8.2826,1.9359,7.9085,0.9473]}

A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless particle transport over long length scales since particle collisions are suppressed by the Boltzmann collision time. The long-range transport of charged particles in the plasma requires also to know the phase-space distribution function near the axis of the plasma where the magnetic field is almost parallel to the axis. The distribution function cannot be described by a single function and must be represented as a superposition of Maxwellian functions with different temperatures. The phase-space distribution function near the axis can be approximated by a sum of N superposed Maxwellian functions. If M is the magnetic moment of these superposed functions and E the electric field vector, they are given by :\nf(r,\u03d5,v)=e\u2212M(r)v\/c+\n\u2211\nfM(r)M(v)\u2212eE(v)e\nwhere e is the elementary charge, E is the electric field vector.

While McCain has been accused of having an interest in reducing judicial nominations to the Senate from the presidency, the Senate in recent years has been unable to confirm most nominees nominated by the president as he has an even larger, and arguably more powerful majority than it does.\nAs Senator, McCain has opposed President George W. Bush's efforts to end wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in several speeches has openly condemned the Iraq War. On January 14, 2009, McCain told a gathering of the National Defense Industrial Association that the United States had acted \" incredibly foolishly \" by invading Iraq. On April 24, 2010, McCain was critical of the Obama administration's decision to end the U. S. combat role in Afghanistan saying that \" the U. S. military presence must be judged on the impact it has had and will have on the Afghan people. \" According to the New York Post, Obama expressed his belief that McCain had \" consistently voiced the views of his party's majority. \" On January 30, 2011, Obama said that \" McCain probably deserves some respect. But let's face it, he has become not just an ideologue, but ideologues of sorts in his campaigning. There are a lot of people who are going to feel some pressure on Monday from McCain. \" In the 2010 midterm elections, McCain did not run against Obama in his district. On October 19, 2010, McCain endorsed Sen. Barack Obama as the Democratic nominee.","token_len":340,"entropy":[7.7673,5.1101,0.1819,9.1721,5.5382,1.1681,7.1756,18.8622,9.8484,2.9168,11.5669,8.5041,0.0259,6.3452,2.8698,1.5048,1.1916,2.1667,2.5862,7.7283,1.3919,7.3873,2.5336,7.3647,0.8589,5.3889,0.5488,3.7932,0.151,2.3102,7.1925,0.309,2.5115,2.5974,2.4129,4.9093,0.9355,6.0007,2.7536,0.4055,6.1609,0.089,0.2451,1.1298,3.1175,0.8888,2.9559,2.4307,0.269,0.5357,5.3686,1.783,2.9579,2.254,4.3917,0.1294,3.8711,3.237,4.2995,0.0235,4.9197,2.3962,2.0924,3.0637,2.1033,2.5632,6.2811,0.9331,5.1373,0.1715,2.1944,1.8582,6.0897,3.8944,0.2278,0.0812,1.9693,4.8438,0.0476,2.7361,5.1808,2.8151,7.4537,0.3245,1.3197,0.468,5.3863,4.1149,1.7593,6.4842,5.317,2.2226,4.9556,2.7983,5.2951,0.5625,1.9104,3.8042,2.4389,3.8026,2.4018,3.9061,1.6017,8.7642,3.8097,2.601,1.2522,0.8631,4.7228,4.0158,2.895,0.0323,0.0384,0.0016,0.1864,3.1574,0.0301,5.0188,6.9751,1.1294,0.1174,0.2575,0.1009,1.0435,1.3993,3.836,6.0413,6.041,2.4224,6.1696,4.8926,0.859,3.2616,0.5048,0.9561,4.0561,3.3933,3.489,0.1643,2.5785,0.0945,0.4435,3.1891,2.4517,3.68,0.1225,1.868,2.3402,4.112,7.421,0.4629,1.2249,1.884,2.4071,0.0036,2.829,7.3707,2.0052,15.631,2.5902,0.7019,2.007,1.7483,3.7301,0.2625,1.4787,2.6877,2.887,3.3142,0.0279,2.6062,0.0602,0.3673,3.1195,5.1786,0.0277,1.3676,1.6774,0.1731,0.3396,1.7425,0.1302,4.5467,0.3893,3.6297,0.0012,6.8373,0.0317,4.2726,2.3839,0.0494,0.8563,8.8139,1.1989,1.4584,5.068,2.8556,0.0019,1.2465,0.0313,1.7931,3.6684,5.342,0.8809,7.3272,1.7197,1.2331,5.9317,1.2786,0.3608,0.6878,3.6277,3.3412,0.0905,0.4471,0.8741,1.955,0.3022,2.108,1.1057,6.6981,0.0029,1.7545,2.7589,0.1091,4.9173,0.4762,5.1787,6.3844,1.768,3.7609,0.214,4.5156,2.7433,1.5134,9.4407,5.8358,3.2881,3.101,0.1954,2.3215,2.0003,1.8988,4.557,3.3305,1.2649,3.4143,2.6148,3.4005,0.042,1.588,0.0813,3.7889,1.9982,0.8478,1.7294,3.1188,7.7181,5.7212,3.4004,3.8106,2.7957,2.682,5.4105,0.6504,3.0201,0.0195,0.5029,1.4893,1.8605,4.4913,5.9783,1.2819,2.4945,3.9831,0.0083,0.9237,0.1483,9.4361,3.645,0.8652,2.641,3.3466,3.5067,2.423,13.9127,1.0133,4.8275,1.4479,2.6893,0.5491,0.0282,1.229,0.7541,2.1352,3.3781,0.1303,4.6154,4.5352,3.6854,3.0187,10.4998,4.1199,2.3361,2.5209,1.5083,4.0409,2.5638,5.9235,2.4463,0.1492,0.1427,1.0223,5.4779,0.8177,3.8124,2.4045,2.0895,1.6774,4.1475,4.7327,1.669,3.2498,2.9548,3.3937,0.0557,1.2969,0.0566,0.4101,3.8151,3.8793,0.0023,2.9238,0.0056,3.7705,0.7738,1.9977,0.5657,2.0538]}

This","text":"The International Union of Operating Engineers ( called Operators for short ) represented the men and women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This group of men of industrial and military experience worked for large oil companies but were paid far below the regular industry rates. For example, a heavy welder for a $ 12 \/ hour company might work 60 to 80 hours a month at $ 9 \/ hour, and an operator driving a pile driver might work a 14 hour day at $10\/ hour.\nBy 1967, the oil companies and their union represented employees began to realize that there was much power at stake. In the face of the growing protests and in an attempt to stop them they would have had to negotiate the wages of their union membership. In 1966 the International Trade Commission began to investigate and after six months of secret hearings in Geneva it found in January 1967 that the unions had failed to negotiate on a fair wage agreement. The result of this investigation was a series of hearings in the United States in 1967. In July 1967 the United States Congress passed legislation that forced the oil companies to negotiate on the wages of their unions.\nThe oil companies, which had organized the unions with the help of the U.S. government, were not pleased. They had tried a number of other methods of controlling the operators but they did not succeed and so they now tried a different method. It was obvious that the oil companies would be unable to pay the wages they promised when the strike broke out and they would do nothing to pay the union. So the oil companies, which had previously been very generous giving the workers very good benefits from their companies, now cut all benefits completely.","token_len":341,"entropy":[8.2399,4.3773,1.3243,4.547,0.0685,1.0504,15.1559,8.6435,1.3043,4.1549,8.4191,1.0673,7.7547,1.5928,9.205,1.0442,0.0661,1.3317,6.7199,2.655,0.3212,4.1511,0.9907,0.7058,7.848,3.4206,4.2787,3.4306,0.5769,5.4173,0.7725,0.4472,5.8915,0.6437,4.2644,3.2643,2.1589,1.8832,6.975,7.304,2.3988,3.0578,2.0009,3.4832,2.6882,7.1799,4.3696,0.8435,6.0857,2.0609,4.7502,4.6184,3.9147,0.7144,5.6224,5.0016,2.6717,0.8057,4.8713,1.638,0.0895,3.0284,6.0149,10.2119,0.6134,4.1873,2.2832,3.9031,10.9705,5.3788,1.1292,4.5208,4.6825,2.9484,4.7825,2.9017,1.8549,0.1015,0.7338,2.8752,3.8269,2.4796,3.6004,0.8906,0.0542,1.7621,2.0698,4.1693,4.1402,9.4784,0.7655,9.5998,8.0784,2.2172,0.2829,3.5723,7.7626,0.8773,1.7224,1.9805,0.1593,7.3072,3.0992,0.3496,0.4356,1.557,7.3147,5.6787,0.6636,1.1182,3.3361,1.3181,3.9983,1.7068,4.2625,4.3398,7.8724,11.3609,0.6064,3.5343,0.569,3.065,0.4429,4.5334,6.6275,3.1386,2.6034,1.5487,2.5922,1.8358,4.039,0.0009,1.882,3.0121,5.3296,1.6798,6.2298,4.3526,1.6426,0.0376,3.8558,3.617,4.5572,5.8462,3.88,3.9923,0.253,3.6341,3.4298,4.7298,1.4205,1.684,3.8561,5.6858,0.7762,2.6929,4.8285,1.5393,2.955,4.0472,3.0188,4.1623,1.157,3.3905,2.7002,5.9448,4.7012,0.8548,1.2597,6.9801,2.1121,3.6528,5.6184,3.6865,1.9955,5.3253,5.8504,0.9032,0.1902,0.9957,4.1816,1.1034,3.5205,0.1364,3.5471,3.9375,1.8397,1.4569,1.5303,4.2789,0.5546,1.4022,4.9406,1.8964,0.9031,0.8458,0.2866,1.5737,3.3955,0.0012,4.0315,2.0235,1.8767,2.2769,0.3394,2.9035,2.8309,2.1505,2.0598,3.779,0.9517,0.8406,2.6759,0.3736,2.8473,0.8065,3.0032,1.716,5.1074,0.5278,1.6324,0.1679,0.267,2.1208,2.8575,2.5815,2.4118,0.3966,0.3559,5.8372,0.4797,1.8426,1.4683,3.8658,0.2031,3.5021,3.4234,1.0768,6.3093,2.4355,4.0613,4.043,1.0723,2.4517,0.0079,0.8931,2.9747,0.0755,0.0278,0.0348,1.9414,0.4465,2.2769,2.9334,4.0457,1.3213,1.5837,2.942,4.5267,4.7864,1.3312,0.0015,2.7851,1.9389,1.6813,5.1781,0.8748,7.8339,2.2748,2.1885,3.2549,0.0668,0.943,2.9507,3.8503,1.3095,6.1331,3.7895,2.034,2.6737,1.2623,1.2183,4.3032,0.5175,6.5147,0.4724,0.9488,2.1361,0.0806,1.8882,2.9808,3.0052,0.0362,3.0541,1.8821,2.3654,2.1694,3.7022,4.5271,1.8603,4.378,2.9371,0.0253,2.2699,1.5946,0.9653,5.6753,1.7723,1.3334,4.7884,1.2591,2.9096,4.1792,3.4931,1.4096,1.8645,0.069,3.5316,2.7706,0.4664,4.4612,1.9157,4.3218,4.2838,8.4058,2.9369,1.9947,5.0846,4.0163,4.1085,4.8274,1.5046,4.8991,0.5166,3.5682,7.0627,3.6621,3.3875,5.7052,0.9336]}

The latter immediately enters the Lier\u00e5sen Tunnel, allowing the same trains to bypass Sandefjord in favour of their Lier\u00e5sen line, saving on time and minimising traffic.\nThe former Sollum station closed in January 1970, and was abandoned as the route between Asker and Kristiansand's central station was taken over by Hj\u00f8rring Line, a freight line not open to passengers. During this period, three intermediate stations -Vindeln, V\u00e6rselse and Ringkalden -existed between Asker Station and Kristiansand, located on the original Norrestrand Railway.\n\nThe Norrestrand Railway in the period after the 1970s\n\nThe line opened first, with a service from Kristiansand to Asker starting in January 1975. On 26 September 1977, the line was extended westwards to a junction with the Troms\u00f8 Line. The line was taken over by the newly expanded Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Regional Rail Administration (now Oslo, Stavanger & Akershus County Railways, Oslo, Stavanger and Akershus Line), who planned to continue the line from Asker back through the tunnel. In 1978, it was decided that the original plan to connect the old Asker line with the Sollum line would not be implemented. The plans for the line had been changed to the current configuration.\nIn 1991, the Asker\u2013Sollum section was electrified as a 25 kV third rail system.","token_len":342,"entropy":[11.2288,9.8681,3.1415,2.6039,6.5948,0.4074,0.7389,7.9856,0.0438,3.5564,1.814,2.0007,8.065,6.152,4.1009,4.7485,3.75,3.0652,0.4753,8.5295,12.7121,3.7408,3.0139,6.4588,5.0205,2.2585,11.3132,5.7057,1.3109,0.9603,1.9436,7.3411,9.343,6.9421,0.9135,5.9307,7.1272,7.8158,4.8241,4.6621,1.513,6.4609,1.5279,5.9689,2.5394,0.2246,4.1244,10.2151,6.2382,1.4985,0.0657,3.6411,7.8443,0.0034,5.4809,4.395,0.7899,0.1284,0.3475,3.4302,2.8962,8.6131,5.285,2.258,1.0627,10.3517,0.0558,3.8427,1.182,0.8411,8.7696,7.1738,5.9533,6.4397,7.6173,1.9544,7.4897,1.1086,4.2139,6.2716,0.9099,1.3361,2.895,4.9558,3.6432,2.1083,6.5345,3.812,3.2075,0.0454,0.8144,6.4738,1.8304,1.0129,5.3616,5.3733,1.8332,1.1939,5.2115,1.3867,0.0833,5.4126,3.246,3.9054,1.0487,5.6263,5.8684,2.4271,2.8163,4.8828,2.7319,6.7171,6.0179,0.2001,4.288,1.2801,5.0793,2.0525,0.9741,0.6719,6.2762,8.1315,2.6284,4.2963,9.9313,5.5836,7.906,1.1295,2.6425,5.1237,1.3692,4.9333,8.4239,0.7603,7.3994,4.7612,6.2067,2.5501,0.1508,9.9255,0.4078,3.3196,1.4033,0.003,2.8559,0.1404,1.7507,0.0125,0.0035,1.792,7.271,1.7292,0.4076,7.8321,5.5528,10.8877,5.2545,3.7828,2.531,1.3034,6.3883,1.6641,5.0972,0.0701,0.0026,1.38,5.122,2.2905,5.6841,4.3941,1.0815,5.3048,0.4754,3.601,0.0003,1.5116,6.4892,4.2201,6.5995,3.0849,2.4088,2.2349,4.0614,1.59,3.5428,0.0257,0.0042,0.5239,1.4641,0.0049,7.0731,0.6383,3.2095,3.0947,0.5195,4.3137,5.1315,2.8341,2.5795,0.4082,1.0943,1.6202,1.3004,2.8122,5.4534,0.5512,1.4144,4.1249,3.1131,0.5407,1.2215,5.4434,3.4289,0.4386,0.0495,2.1142,1.6232,1.543,1.5386,1.4492,6.3759,0.0751,0.1492,1.1855,6.3495,5.9988,2.8834,2.2549,4.6041,3.3253,0.8873,1.4017,6.2734,8.8591,2.7797,7.4118,1.5622,6.2156,5.5572,4.4386,7.2653,1.6219,0.199,3.2911,6.962,1.2699,2.7562,9.5372,3.0591,2.4687,3.1227,3.2745,2.2471,3.1171,0.0992,0.0064,2.6499,1.2056,0.0024,0.003,7.7411,1.3441,2.9677,5.3544,0.4072,4.6584,0.9866,1.8201,2.9877,2.0912,0.0034,7.2194,4.4056,1.1664,6.32,1.4474,2.9784,3.6426,0.3598,3.812,0.455,3.8205,1.0228,0.678,6.1664,4.4546,2.1738,3.6953,0.9495,5.1595,2.1359,0.0014,3.0944,1.2649,0.4002,5.0397,0.0817,0.0339,1.8106,1.3134,2.1918,0.536,3.7085,1.2494,1.8571,6.2328,2.4735,0.8304,4.2549,3.3137,0.6851,4.1572,1.3105,3.0792,4.498,6.7425,2.2603,0.8303,16.9823,5.6936,0.2442,0.8838,4.7658,0.0051,8.5846,2.1152,0.1404,0.0096,7.2737,1.3347,6.5296,0.0178,4.1931,1.5363,7.9526,4.779,1.2179,9.0857,1.0029,3.3814,1.4579]}

She signed a Royal Warrant on 29 June 1856 naming the first Medal awarded.\nThe two original medals were made by Richard Payne Knight, sculptor the first to earn a Victoria Cross, with the design created by Sir Richard Arkwright, a British Army officer. This is the gold medal now known as the Victoria Cross, now displayed at the National Museum of Wales. A similar medal was made of silver in 1874 and is now owned by the Imperial War Museum in London. Both are currently located in Wales.\nIn July 1865, the British Army introduced an order similar to the Victoria Cross. This was the first of the series of awards known as the Cross of Distinguished Conduct and was awarded at discretion of the commanding officer. From the date of the Queen's Royal Warrant until 1899, the Victoria Cross was the highest award of Distinguished Conduct and for the best military service.\nIn 1899, the British Army stopped recommending the Victoria Cross for civilian awards. From this time onwards, the medal was the highest award for gallantry for all armed forces.\nAfter World War II, the medal was awarded to men and women who displayed exceptional conduct in all situations, in addition to men and women who had distinguished themselves during the war.\nThe Cross now bears the portrait of Henry Dunbar, a Scottish Field Marshal and the first British commander to receive a Victoria Cross.\nThe medal has also been known as the Dunbar Cross, the Dunbar Prize, the Dunbar Medal, the Dunbar medals, and the Dunbar Order.","token_len":342,"entropy":[7.2326,11.0361,4.1287,2.1091,4.376,1.1726,4.0266,0.2641,1.1482,1.6263,4.6118,2.6229,4.4372,9.0463,0.401,7.0106,0.0088,4.2135,2.1653,5.9323,1.8036,0.8742,3.2823,5.2647,0.2613,10.5787,3.5156,8.1879,0.0139,0.0004,0.7697,0.8514,5.2237,6.326,2.8846,5.787,2.7771,3.4996,4.7539,2.6377,0.7746,2.0292,6.4695,1.3485,4.5186,8.1785,5.4093,4.1658,1.2722,10.3874,5.9703,4.0637,3.3606,1.0076,4.5226,2.0935,6.7196,7.3464,8.168,1.1954,7.0928,0.0207,8.364,2.9793,2.2909,5.7786,1.7265,1.4685,0.0185,1.3451,4.5411,1.3221,6.5878,5.6239,0.2293,3.8831,3.4548,8.6773,1.1664,1.4214,2.8259,3.246,4.6284,2.8121,1.0801,4.6275,2.8134,0.8953,6.3418,0.8,5.829,2.3565,0.0866,0.2773,0.9832,0.0276,2.2019,5.2002,5.1125,1.2676,0.964,3.4046,1.2479,0.9099,3.3981,0.574,5.0163,3.8868,0.9312,0.6088,2.236,4.224,2.5823,1.7319,1.0044,4.0527,2.5829,2.5247,1.6221,4.9853,0.0682,0.7355,5.2455,1.65,0.3828,0.954,0.935,0.1519,5.0676,2.8995,4.163,5.7217,0.7155,4.0388,0.4811,0.529,3.2154,4.8892,5.4752,0.6028,1.3048,2.3718,1.579,4.5726,3.0442,4.6812,7.3697,0.013,0.7084,1.0184,0.0115,2.1086,1.9703,1.6663,2.2377,0.6752,3.8399,2.6289,4.9158,0.529,5.5789,4.3622,0.1408,0.6747,4.3801,1.5718,5.9783,4.4364,3.2384,2.6435,1.5445,1.6326,3.543,10.4934,1.8067,0.4018,4.223,0.2628,0.9102,6.3646,2.3066,2.8454,0.2009,1.316,6.6354,0.0474,4.2511,2.7742,3.5395,7.402,0.3444,0.899,1.9988,0.0113,0.7077,2.905,2.8857,2.083,2.3531,9.2792,0.0346,0.1,2.6998,6.0033,1.6137,6.3996,3.0556,1.5136,1.5165,1.078,2.3359,4.4101,0.3809,0.8298,2.0506,0.7145,7.8552,9.0268,1.3417,1.3802,0.0031,1.7336,5.0916,4.2269,0.8355,5.9239,3.3295,1.9067,3.1275,0.3223,0.8719,2.5986,0.6761,4.6328,2.1379,1.6551,3.0862,4.5099,0.0012,3.7065,1.9517,4.957,0.2287,1.2257,1.3195,4.7146,2.5156,0.0011,1.8588,0.1957,0.5658,2.3467,0.6014,3.5274,1.1004,4.1138,1.6499,0.049,1.19,5.9058,3.0279,5.5531,1.8102,3.7061,4.448,1.7332,4.0257,3.294,0.0045,5.3082,0.5301,0.0211,0.6958,2.1413,4.4226,0.2707,3.6053,1.6471,1.23,0.5095,1.3989,1.51,5.6553,6.1928,4.0207,0.563,6.514,0.0831,5.0028,9.1579,1.838,0.7982,2.4183,4.2813,7.331,0.2534,2.162,2.681,1.2419,1.6127,3.9322,0.8308,2.0245,1.9287,0.786,0.0087,0.4588,1.338,1.2938,2.2077,2.7138,2.8665,0.2528,4.9988,0.2377,0.213,9.3013,0.0434,2.0764,1.2942,2.1732,2.9502,0.0472,6.9677,0.8127,0.9095,1.8373,0.0038,1.2048,0.7477,0.6532,1.389,0.0057,9.2807,1.0199,1.2511,0.305,1.3424,0.0057,5.9321,0.7968]}
{"prompt":"Sorraia are generally dun or a dun variation called grullo . Dun coloring includes primitive markings such as a black dorsal stripe , black tipped ears , horizontal striping on the legs and a dark","text":"Sorraia are generally dun or a dun variation called grullo. Dun coloring includes primitive markings such as a black dorsal stripe, black tipped ears, horizontal striping on the legs and a dark eye. Dun coloring patterns can sometimes vary, such as light and dark dun on one side. Grey coloring patterns include variations like whitish on the chest and white on the flanks and sometimes the legs.\nMale and female are similar in color. Females with dun coloring patterns are thought to have a less preferred mate selection in the community and to be a slightly less appealing female because of black coloring on the legs and tail. White or pink colored females are preferred. The male color pattern appears to indicate fighting ability; therefore males with a dun color pattern often have an unfair advantage over males that have a light color pattern, and it is also in this way that males often avoid fighting with their brother. This might be an advantage because if fighting with one's father one might need to fight with numerous older brothers and be ready to fight at any time, while if one fights with a younger brother one has a fighting chance with only one potential opponent.\nDuncroft sheep are often observed as a separate breed. In reality, this might be two breeds separated by only one to two generations, which is rare for sheep breeds to maintain such close genetic resemblance to one another. The most common explanation as to why they appear to be separate breeds is that of differences in color pattern and geographic distribution. In Portugal the duncroft sheep are mainly located to the south of the Lisbon Basin or Alentejo, though they are also found in other areas. In France they are found in the region of the Massif Central.","token_len":343,"entropy":[7.325,5.8742,7.8477,6.4515,5.5656,12.4525,6.3093,5.4411,4.0397,9.8967,7.0906,10.0932,7.2627,1.1656,4.8092,11.3256,5.9369,11.3908,5.7631,2.3745,0.0019,2.3069,3.5355,7.1014,1.269,0.9695,2.617,8.0304,5.2107,0.4018,8.0132,8.1412,0.8118,2.2097,0.4103,6.0491,1.224,1.9188,3.903,6.0964,1.2614,3.8539,2.2676,7.2278,2.5263,4.6787,3.7751,4.4398,4.1202,0.0071,6.0476,3.7729,0.4197,9.6622,5.6528,3.593,0.297,4.0743,6.6648,2.4282,4.6541,2.8226,7.7941,4.2019,7.0293,0.7187,4.0878,0.4821,5.0754,1.2313,3.0231,0.6701,0.0843,6.0972,0.0117,3.0968,5.692,3.9033,3.7483,0.6945,1.7099,14.9536,3.3065,0.6713,5.0921,4.6567,0.9891,2.0227,1.6399,2.3544,5.5306,5.9625,1.4689,3.1055,1.035,6.9819,0.0572,1.31,1.9447,4.7663,8.8424,5.2662,4.5481,4.2691,1.7339,7.1426,3.0031,3.7174,1.2361,4.4359,5.9859,1.4931,7.0119,3.5043,4.9537,0.7066,7.9497,3.5997,2.6888,0.6315,1.7698,1.2243,3.5473,0.2652,5.9672,2.9415,4.9558,3.1695,1.1152,1.1206,3.2934,3.7898,2.9292,3.273,3.496,2.6181,4.5854,1.188,5.7926,9.9099,3.728,4.8616,5.3651,2.4072,0.9761,2.2865,2.2408,2.9384,0.1508,3.8772,1.4659,3.5497,6.1894,0.0724,1.3577,3.5422,3.6123,1.1707,0.7855,4.4032,2.2203,0.2215,3.7106,2.8818,4.2563,0.5558,3.7686,6.4756,1.9666,2.3187,0.3048,1.4857,4.6559,5.4781,4.1593,3.0231,3.472,6.1468,1.1845,4.1713,5.8043,0.8573,4.0974,1.7452,3.0969,4.3723,5.7025,1.723,1.975,2.7458,5.5078,6.6332,4.0019,5.8355,0.4383,2.4701,0.7915,8.5714,5.9406,1.1473,2.5474,4.9131,4.8655,0.5418,1.1407,3.9638,2.287,0.8493,2.3784,3.1158,1.9439,4.4777,1.7655,0.3064,1.8673,2.9413,0.1539,0.7573,4.6351,2.0647,5.3777,1.1028,4.2568,3.7093,1.2648,7.4082,1.9461,0.3112,1.0936,3.0806,9.9858,8.9982,1.9887,10.7007,1.3576,3.3176,5.7622,3.4442,2.6906,5.388,2.2383,1.5611,3.3872,5.5786,0.5409,2.9274,5.6149,0.5729,7.9243,4.5804,4.2011,0.4163,3.1733,0.9098,6.8053,1.0573,1.8824,1.9211,3.3352,1.1754,5.0381,2.4303,2.2979,4.4979,4.5675,5.8631,3.7548,4.2426,2.4473,6.5531,2.4618,2.7238,0.0042,0.2379,2.3825,3.8864,0.3948,6.3158,4.7142,0.016,0.1111,3.8896,4.2092,1.2797,0.5433,3.1054,1.8819,0.2377,0.4999,4.8114,6.3124,0.1869,4.8832,4.8192,2.7471,7.3367,1.6207,0.6195,2.8397,10.2811,3.0275,3.5115,14.83,0.9693,1.2992,5.7451,6.1075,5.8126,0.2433,1.296,0.6825,0.8169,6.8201,5.4725,5.0552,7.1676,5.918,2.3117,2.1087,4.747,2.0067,1.3725,0.8754,1.1544,0.8115,2.8218,1.8702,2.4143,2.145,5.1026,2.33,0.4476,1.4088,0.9129,0.8111,4.2634,0.3862,2.9591,8.1048,1.6619,7.8879,2.3921]}

To stand against","text":"Lord Beckett gains power over Davy Jones, and with the help of Jones'ship, the Flying Dutchman, he is now executing his plans to extinguish piracy forever. To stand against him, L'Enchanteur is in the midst of his battle to return to his old form of beast, and must choose between using the power granted to him by the Devil in the Dark Continent, or simply die trying. The second act of the play is filled with action, with lots of character development on every side. L'Enchanteur is becoming more and more of a force to be reckoned with, while Beckett is trying to figure out what he wants in the meantime. A final act takes you to see what can be achieved, as Beckett finds out that he can now manipulate the ship, and use it as a weapon against L'Enchanteur. He is more than happy to use such power, as he has long wanted to take over everything. At the end we see L'Enchanteur at his core, a man with the ambition to build a world. A tragic man, who wants power and control over everyone, with no regard for the people he has taken over in the process. This is the point at which we see how much power really corrupts, and what happens to the great men who gain it. These are characters with true heart and ambition, all wanting more from life than simply gaining it. However, it can be concluded that even as they gain power, they do not truly know what it means to be human in the end. Davy Jones is a symbol of every man attempting to gain control over his life... but only getting more to lose.","token_len":343,"entropy":[10.3779,1.6387,12.1059,5.1937,2.8099,9.5447,1.7906,0.0712,1.4933,2.7823,5.5725,1.9077,1.2542,0.0039,5.4344,1.8775,15.4466,0.9529,1.9065,8.1075,2.2818,0.0421,3.994,2.8625,2.1681,4.6637,9.3709,2.3195,2.5516,0.8991,8.9568,0.0004,7.5907,7.5276,0.3319,5.4147,8.2278,0.9585,2.7615,0.634,7.1128,4.3782,2.5636,5.7457,2.0845,2.8644,5.3318,2.3911,3.9284,0.0053,3.1341,3.7612,3.1733,6.3816,0.9178,1.9329,3.8667,4.7918,2.1718,9.0899,3.7061,1.2551,4.4634,3.6045,0.6827,5.6824,1.7603,2.6078,4.9969,1.1395,0.1687,0.3099,1.1435,5.2609,3.5896,2.2451,5.112,5.7504,1.55,0.2097,4.5466,6.3119,2.1535,0.4332,3.1122,5.7431,3.6243,0.7245,0.618,4.3991,1.4373,4.8204,0.053,4.0555,1.5334,2.4004,7.3157,0.0452,4.4455,1.2703,5.631,6.075,1.1254,1.0033,4.7168,0.0632,0.0247,0.0008,0.0044,1.381,8.0669,1.5287,0.4974,0.0009,2.4865,0.3182,4.3108,0.5647,0.0267,0.007,0.002,0.9575,4.7718,4.1524,0.0024,1.1549,4.4773,0.1221,3.4156,0.0178,1.5849,1.968,2.0944,4.437,1.3833,6.4448,0.3322,4.6893,4.9214,1.6416,3.5911,7.4651,1.332,4.4171,3.078,5.3911,0.8379,2.0713,2.9726,2.8204,1.6057,0.0012,4.4797,1.8969,0.7729,1.8471,2.2097,4.3539,5.1285,0.9623,5.6026,2.9585,1.1927,5.2928,0.9164,1.8179,0.5115,1.3556,1.1972,3.4411,0.0147,0.0055,0.0002,0.0016,0.7403,4.163,1.9811,5.7689,0.8999,1.6987,0.0682,2.8069,5.8872,2.2825,1.1636,1.9639,0.753,2.7256,6.1886,3.243,0.4225,4.4203,2.4985,6.0172,2.3254,5.159,0.7022,0.5379,5.7916,1.1173,2.5225,0.0107,0.0068,0.0001,0.0023,5.3145,1.4856,6.1071,0.4368,3.9098,1.8657,2.7231,2.4572,5.9133,0.7276,5.3067,0.6853,1.8525,4.3067,4.0103,8.2588,4.4718,1.1332,2.2617,4.1044,5.5361,2.5036,2.0653,0.9262,3.9684,1.2531,4.3143,1.9008,3.4913,0.137,1.4282,2.2885,2.31,2.3908,3.73,0.9139,4.5022,1.0738,3.1698,0.2158,3.2368,0.8853,1.7587,4.8215,1.8194,0.017,2.7265,1.6738,2.9294,2.4514,4.0205,8.2824,8.5271,0.0225,3.4068,0.7026,2.6035,3.531,1.5965,1.5728,6.4026,2.8531,1.3116,6.5183,0.9863,0.5159,5.8951,1.0905,4.6194,3.3701,6.4746,4.2141,0.8421,5.5544,0.6557,5.6064,5.5713,3.8048,3.8014,4.4252,1.3356,5.1784,5.2448,1.478,0.2808,5.9075,0.24,2.9447,4.1268,0.7244,6.6373,0.3106,4.6908,3.6359,2.5254,3.3479,0.4827,0.4208,0.7527,3.2271,0.7603,3.6501,2.5666,1.0974,1.3371,1.958,0.3885,0.6864,1.1788,4.3498,0.7175,1.3981,0.2856,8.8705,0.0014,0.2143,1.265,1.7611,6.5956,0.2641,6.8855,1.7222,7.4386,0.2449,3.9628,2.8197,0.5018,1.4343,2.9982,6.1953,2.8886,3.2672,7.0705,3.3035,5.6222,4.705,0.9207]}

During early development when team members debated where the setting would be chosen to take place the game was planned on having New York City as a setting as it was a popular choice. However due to the project's completion during the end of development and the game being set in Seattle rather than New York City, the setting itself was never used in a promotional campaign or gameplay.\nThe game was also released in a limited number of stores, such as GAME in New York City and Barnes and Noble, where it garnered a mixed or disapproving reception. The game was released in the United Kingdom on March 28, 2014, by Sony Computer Entertainment, in Japan in February 2015, by Sony Interactive Entertainment, in India in June 2015, by Microsoft Studios India, by PlayStation 4 in the United States on August 15, 2014, and in Australia in November 13, 2014.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn the gameplay, players can choose one of the two protagonists, Nathan Drake or Samus Aran. During the gameplay there is a continuous loop of the player using their guns to shoot various enemies, which are typically monsters and humans, while also shooting obstacles like walls or vehicles. Although the game has various missions, gameplay focuses mostly on a single location in which the player has to complete the tasks of the game. Some players find some challenges to be too easy.\nPlayers can choose their weapons to suit their play style, such as sniper rifle, assault rifle, or machine gun. Using the sniper rifle while in night vision mode will also allow the player to search for the targets through dark areas.","token_len":344,"entropy":[10.7847,0.2688,13.7099,0.7558,6.2951,12.5386,4.9318,2.8544,5.3149,6.8271,0.5191,4.6734,3.2652,5.6744,6.0123,8.0274,2.9043,1.8629,7.0366,4.2128,2.5673,1.6449,8.3525,2.2514,7.3083,9.0151,2.5895,6.5352,7.0605,3.8489,7.1987,7.0832,0.5118,6.6843,5.6454,1.8643,7.1594,1.3766,1.3322,4.9984,2.9222,3.2182,1.5299,4.2563,3.9285,2.1537,7.1296,4.7039,3.5402,6.4755,0.741,0.407,1.3106,1.7498,2.615,3.6444,2.6937,1.2135,2.6429,4.42,3.3002,1.8227,3.294,3.4787,0.006,1.1514,6.9463,0.7834,7.8873,4.5932,1.3997,5.5488,0.0786,2.0543,3.1852,1.524,4.9094,1.591,4.8996,0.6154,2.842,5.9591,0.0311,2.3236,0.0702,0.1803,1.0916,1.3473,4.2718,5.0265,0.6852,3.3158,4.2276,1.9779,3.4227,6.6118,3.0179,2.7935,5.2851,1.5545,0.8749,9.9681,2.0818,1.2526,2.8359,3.5544,1.2396,3.0079,1.9121,3.4522,0.0677,4.8263,2.2499,3.8658,0.0058,6.3985,4.5796,3.8541,0.0816,0.9597,1.36,7.2013,1.9392,0.0072,3.5483,3.5235,0.892,6.2894,1.6875,4.1193,7.7143,9.9703,1.4527,1.9587,0.6154,2.3438,1.0957,1.0548,2.613,1.403,2.2999,1.7347,2.4612,2.2774,3.2999,3.5068,0.2969,2.8467,1.5718,5.9593,3.7373,0.3741,0.0004,3.2049,3.8205,4.1873,4.3835,2.5394,0.7802,0.4584,3.3922,2.903,2.5366,0.0024,1.3354,0.981,5.7058,0.82,2.5077,0.5319,0.3501,1.7143,3.9593,1.6113,7.6583,1.2793,5.4882,5.9091,2.774,0.9309,3.3254,0.9492,0.0876,1.6225,2.1414,3.0256,0.1225,3.2623,0.2482,0.5357,1.1183,2.4184,2.0159,1.9564,8.295,0.0671,0.1668,0.1701,0.9386,4.5484,2.8616,0.9199,0.0003,2.9182,0.999,4.6985,1.3986,2.5586,3.0502,1.9888,3.4038,0.3223,2.7414,3.2905,6.2079,1.9279,8.6032,1.886,1.2431,4.5981,2.4107,0.1802,0.0002,1.1973,4.9751,0.9854,3.011,4.1843,1.1511,0.483,7.2367,4.1405,1.483,3.6341,1.7081,4.4427,1.9713,5.898,0.9243,1.9997,3.8332,0.8423,1.8372,2.7685,2.231,6.2533,7.3312,2.6657,5.6764,2.3447,3.0225,2.6962,3.8539,7.385,4.3444,4.1295,1.9887,5.014,0.568,5.9594,1.3192,2.0384,2.5992,5.0629,5.5726,1.5467,6.1478,5.2796,3.6025,0.0909,4.4145,1.1495,5.0128,3.3931,3.0646,1.1512,0.3072,3.1878,0.4043,3.3366,1.8675,4.7756,2.2682,2.058,2.3646,0.9944,4.5984,4.2704,4.3855,5.0778,3.4127,2.165,0.9487,2.4884,3.4343,3.3051,1.5507,21.9682,0.8404,2.3796,2.9629,5.1082,2.8335,5.8281,0.2819,2.5515,0.34,1.2784,2.5864,0.008,5.1425,3.0375,0.5692,4.877,0.0732,0.2778,1.9837,3.7879,0.1375,0.3379,5.5489,1.6958,3.5874,0.1188,4.9331,2.6244,11.1214,0.9058,0.9457,2.0322,3.3059,2.3551,1.075,0.143,0.0457,7.6326,0.7967,2.9052,3.1658,4.8329,6.4534,0.984,1.0996]}

The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMissionary Settlement\n\nThe Purgitsville Mission was founded c. 1781 as a mission to the Cherokee Indians in West Virginia. The first missionary group arrived in 1787. Missionary mission work was extended to the Crees, and then on to the Choctaws (also called Choctawas) in 1838. \nA second set of missionaries settled at Wounded Knee in the American Civil War from 1862 to 1865. The missionaries worked to provide education, healthcare, and social service to Native Americans at the post.\nIn the late 19th century the Purgitsville Mission received funding to move the mission to a larger campus, at what became Purgitsburg, for the purpose of expanding missionary outreach. The Purgitsburg mission was moved near Purgitsville in 1893, and would serve as the second location between 1873 and 1897 of the mission school. The Purgittsburg campus was moved once again in 1897 to the location near Purgitsville which is the most recognizable part of Old Pine Church.\nIn the 1930s with the founding of Pine Academy from an independent system founded by teachers in the Purgitsville area, the local population began to decline, resulting in the Purgitsburg campus being abandoned.\nThe Purgitsville campus was given to Pine Academy and the school continued under the name Purgitsburg School until the 1980's. The Pine Academy name was changed to Old Pine High School in 2017.","token_len":344,"entropy":[11.4297,7.2799,9.9457,5.8842,0.7935,0.8327,3.694,10.6721,11.1318,1.3139,0.0395,7.6389,4.1629,3.0347,11.3719,2.1395,0.4522,2.1,4.696,0.7972,2.2737,3.8283,1.2049,7.3979,14.0987,6.157,6.967,6.8007,1.1667,0.4419,1.3641,4.9201,13.0491,16.4867,2.4168,0.6657,6.3139,0.4061,0.5534,1.5716,3.2094,1.2685,4.4346,2.8608,0.7098,3.4248,0.034,0.0984,0.0003,0.0006,1.2426,1.6278,0.0209,7.4686,0.8009,9.5179,1.4321,0.0003,1.4874,12.1836,0.1175,0.0044,1.3806,4.4006,1.0672,10.1207,0.1194,1.8201,4.6527,2.9347,0.5404,3.8993,1.7064,1.599,7.3814,2.4186,1.8619,3.9566,0.121,0.4637,1.1004,3.5833,3.4375,4.7019,3.2906,0.3181,2.4788,2.6566,1.6397,5.8177,1.1508,6.5601,4.986,1.647,6.3426,0.7256,1.3035,8.4145,3.5873,2.1926,2.6056,3.7023,4.9633,0.3402,0.8283,6.4108,0.019,4.2507,3.6543,3.4568,1.9037,3.3426,0.0156,0.8758,6.9858,1.5373,1.0981,1.231,5.0197,0.376,9.4609,4.255,15.6349,4.5354,6.082,0.0184,1.4752,4.5153,2.943,5.4133,3.6104,0.164,0.0214,1.1527,2.4235,6.268,5.9339,0.0045,5.5761,4.6719,0.5528,1.3059,0.2983,1.6744,3.698,3.5381,2.6739,3.9406,3.9545,1.6371,4.4472,0.2115,0.7245,3.9147,2.3914,0.743,4.0057,0.4546,4.141,0.9631,7.2501,2.3629,1.4463,16.0538,1.7969,2.7586,2.4374,0.0105,0.1166,1.7298,7.5896,0.0353,0.0041,0.3403,3.6845,3.8215,2.2463,4.2666,2.5963,4.0057,0.8599,1.9947,3.1063,6.0437,2.1795,4.5921,6.2703,3.3109,5.4791,0.144,5.1741,1.8309,5.633,1.148,2.0134,0.0076,3.6586,3.6051,3.799,0.8091,1.5759,4.6663,0.0193,2.3658,2.593,1.5236,3.9577,8.3549,5.5074,0.0618,0.1635,2.3618,5.1858,1.5672,1.0411,7.593,4.487,0.9224,1.0701,3.8983,3.8114,7.5107,6.0312,4.5285,0.088,3.149,4.6155,0.4892,3.6355,7.231,0.6663,1.8176,3.9416,7.4317,5.269,7.0257,1.0453,3.3133,6.7276,0.5592,0.4405,3.067,2.0307,1.793,5.4464,3.1368,3.4346,0.5299,0.2965,5.5688,1.6129,3.5092,4.3867,6.5411,2.7138,0.0184,6.2174,0.269,0.1899,0.5425,0.6858,15.3396,1.5925,3.7441,0.338,6.8005,0.4811,5.6104,0.053,6.5258,7.4753,6.5835,4.5302,4.6822,8.1619,5.9585,0.8533,8.0311,2.141,1.6957,8.2562,1.5364,0.0152,2.7664,0.5049,0.7586,6.101,5.614,1.7382,0.3598,4.8836,2.1738,4.7226,0.014,0.9092,6.4916,1.9723,4.3173,3.3635,0.5107,3.8032,1.037,1.6963,7.9321,3.3288,1.0068,0.0541,2.7121,1.114,5.6971,2.4612,3.7787,0.9067,3.0025,2.1399,2.9642,4.6728,5.2272,0.7499,2.1775,3.8841,1.052,2.3903,2.973,2.2575,1.5308,3.926,2.316,0.6404,1.4794,3.6828,0.5604,5.2018,1.0622,0.6667,0.3271,5.5237,0.0485,5.5607,0.0494,0.7791,5.8046,0.5127]}

In addition to her television work, Rigg also appeared as Mrs.\nThe first season of Rome began airing on the Fox Network on April 13, 2006 and concluded on August 5, 2006. The fourteenth American release of the show had aired for only one season before a second season on the American network History Channel was canceled at the same time as the second season was set up on the network, Fox. The British actor, Sean Durkin who plays the younger Julius Caesar was the first actor cast by the show s original producers to appear in all ten of the series. The series has a rating of 8.5 on IMDb.\nDuncan was a great actress, I loved The Musketeers. She used to perform in the Edinburgh Fringe. You can be sure if I was to play anything (as the Queen) I would play my own character and not make a mockery of anyone else's.

This is the third phase of the project. Construction for phase one (also known as the Welsh Phase) began in 2000 and concluded in 2010. Phase two, which was renamed the Eastern Bay Link Road, was completed in 2018 and the fourth phase of the project will commence in 2020.\nThe proposed route of the Eastern Bay Link consists of sections of the current coastal route and the Welsh Coastal Route, both of which are now a Class 1 road. In both routes there is no significant level crossing, making it a \"closed road\". A number of tunnels have been required in order to overcome the natural geological feature, the Old Lyme Cut; and to accommodate the road and the rail lines.\nThe project is controversial as to whether or not it should be funded by the government. The Welsh government, and Wales overall, have supported the Eastern Bay Link. A recent survey found that 78% of Welsh residents support this, and 92% of Cymru residents support the new road. This supports a similar survey released earlier in 2013, which indicated that 72% of Swansea residents support the East Bay Link, with 65% supporting the North Wales Coastal Link.\nIn recent months, it has been suggested that a toll may be placed on the Eastern Bay Link Road. The project would cost approximately \u00a3280 million (about \u20ac300 million \/ $336 million) and the road would be funded in three phases.","token_len":346,"entropy":[8.5766,2.4744,6.4311,2.4357,3.2674,5.0823,0.8887,6.445,13.321,7.6869,5.6104,11.2746,5.5807,3.2562,7.707,7.5526,1.6461,3.9544,4.2427,6.4287,2.0827,8.5216,7.6178,7.514,4.0105,3.011,13.3929,7.1587,5.6752,9.2813,5.4429,7.6647,7.6589,2.9999,5.8009,4.3478,7.7531,9.9771,5.1093,5.4916,8.0714,11.7011,6.0135,10.8121,1.4345,2.2313,3.7471,6.04,9.3771,4.5012,2.8608,6.1251,2.7705,1.6061,7.1203,6.5112,2.6701,6.279,0.1885,1.4637,4.0504,0.815,3.7579,1.2051,2.9396,2.8201,1.0329,5.1909,4.0296,0.1612,0.4499,2.2283,1.2422,4.3145,6.2357,7.2366,2.0707,4.6045,6.4611,0.7173,0.0188,0.8397,6.9773,6.455,2.2987,0.7431,1.3271,6.1739,1.5044,5.0941,0.1921,2.7993,0.2329,2.8644,0.3394,3.5141,1.6316,2.4446,6.5128,0.8869,3.4613,0.188,1.3621,0.8073,1.121,1.4386,0.602,0.1018,5.4274,1.4158,4.0845,5.3795,0.1735,2.1611,0.3204,0.2467,3.3222,2.6721,0.3098,1.1323,0.1492,1.143,6.1889,5.4363,2.4877,2.838,0.3859,2.6949,0.0161,0.1305,9.0528,0.0507,6.5806,0.3417,1.8398,5.2926,6.2291,3.6406,2.9588,1.8266,6.5274,3.7432,0.664,2.071,3.1111,0.5856,0.01,1.0555,3.3184,5.5156,9.3738,2.2815,2.7848,0.7829,3.8127,3.9086,4.6577,2.8437,0.8172,3.0999,4.5833,6.1873,2.7012,2.7053,4.7504,1.2081,2.0878,5.3853,5.1493,2.6258,0.6278,3.8271,3.1624,0.0019,6.1578,1.517,0.1682,7.6587,2.8067,0.6752,0.0694,4.8071,0.9445,6.3806,6.3221,5.0145,3.1101,3.6579,7.2868,8.0192,7.9184,6.7574,3.6021,2.1758,3.3767,0.9425,6.1894,3.8628,2.0438,6.3296,3.1122,0.8567,1.5491,1.2221,3.644,1.7005,8.3466,2.9463,4.3943,0.9201,1.3943,0.0026,1.0992,2.0674,0.3567,3.6998,2.6528,1.008,2.5137,1.1002,1.581,2.7554,1.7873,3.5222,4.1886,5.7405,9.3908,0.2661,1.1347,4.9315,0.5509,3.1674,0.0165,0.0404,2.8756,3.9079,2.9422,2.5919,2.3482,0.2774,5.8172,0.3983,0.1448,3.169,2.1713,2.1086,4.4153,4.0289,1.5556,5.376,0.021,1.0374,7.6625,5.5847,0.0219,1.112,1.5121,0.8279,5.6956,2.0157,0.413,3.2398,4.7875,2.0346,5.9054,4.4737,7.3524,2.7003,2.5366,3.6722,1.9212,0.901,3.1799,0.4159,4.295,0.0302,0.1509,7.8262,0.4066,1.5867,0.2671,3.7465,0.0659,0.0394,1.4871,2.2068,4.6348,0.0059,2.7992,0.5196,5.2734,2.3579,5.0979,3.6743,0.6902,0.9615,3.0662,4.4066,1.9012,0.6217,4.6837,0.2334,0.4995,1.3525,0.1038,3.1854,6.0559,4.4101,0.1354,3.2982,0.1749,0.2753,2.5208,0.0271,0.0508,3.7111,1.6735,1.7262,3.7096,2.6406,2.6965,3.2934,0.2242,6.7123,0.4301,2.6921,2.6693,3.8134,3.5655,0.0918,6.5249,1.9627,7.1838,0.0343,1.1709,1.3184,2.7792,4.4432,0.5665,1.6266,3.6895,3.0017,3.109,1.0763,1.0779]}

The spacecraft had originally been designed to land using a paraglider and a set of skis or wheels, however due to budget considerations, the use of a wheel landing system was selected instead, requiring a completely new, two-wheel landing gear that would be flown on the Gemini spacecraft.\nThe original landing system configuration of the Gemini Program was to have a single wheel driven directly by the thrusters and a separate wheel, for use as a spare wheel. With the use of the wheel and motor system, the spacecraft would be able to deploy a landing gear with a skid. The landing gear was designed to deploy on an inclined runway or on a landing pad, with the wheels on the spacecraft engaging the runway for landing support.\nAs the original program proposal was altered to allow multiple landing wheels per spacecraft, one or two additional landing wheels on each spacecraft were added. The use of two landing wheels allowed a spacecraft to land in both directions on any runway, and the option to land in either direction on an inclined runway as well.\nWhile the landing system was redesigned with wheels, the main components of the landing gear were retained. The main components were the wheels and wheel assemblies, the landing gear deployment structure (in this case a skid), a parachute, the winch assembly and the landing gear air bags.\nThe wheels and wheel assemblies were made entirely of aluminum, made so that all the major system components could be mounted to one flat base plate. The wheels were driven by a DC electric motor, attached to the rear fuselage strut of the spacecraft, with a transmission passing power from the motor to the wheel axle and wheel assemblies.","token_len":347,"entropy":[9.654,3.0198,7.819,2.1983,5.9329,8.3933,1.0757,7.2075,2.9777,8.972,1.4909,1.3839,3.5816,1.4339,1.6751,4.4749,3.0661,5.0209,0.3628,2.6138,0.5184,1.6384,5.7655,1.0841,8.7104,5.2655,0.0344,0.6852,2.319,2.6807,6.9415,0.0416,7.169,0.8151,5.0473,4.5816,1.5423,5.7003,5.3629,0.0045,3.9598,5.4515,0.766,0.9574,5.1422,0.0069,1.3404,5.1517,5.1448,1.6843,0.9096,5.9924,2.3383,3.0141,5.604,1.5841,6.4275,0.9583,4.168,6.2281,0.1804,3.4291,1.4359,4.3281,3.8046,1.4495,1.7939,6.4375,1.7057,1.4672,3.1893,1.2654,0.5643,1.515,6.9574,4.9137,3.1485,3.554,7.2412,2.8819,0.1478,0.9048,7.5387,0.857,2.5452,2.0106,1.1309,2.4695,4.0422,8.063,7.3461,2.3646,0.783,5.7957,0.1137,2.5862,1.7738,4.3184,2.8257,5.1792,5.2923,2.3379,2.3149,0.4749,7.3743,2.5156,1.3009,4.4689,0.5881,3.2067,0.0023,1.8503,4.085,3.5967,5.8674,3.356,0.4884,0.4849,2.4563,0.8446,1.0081,1.0416,0.0044,5.4321,2.1553,3.0511,1.153,3.5478,1.7602,6.9274,1.6677,3.5405,1.2417,2.4442,0.2426,1.9027,2.7576,0.2511,3.7869,2.63,3.5777,3.9556,3.5411,3.4186,2.8098,0.8033,3.6044,1.493,1.9621,2.5031,0.7964,3.9607,3.0742,0.7126,5.067,6.7134,0.9058,2.524,3.8447,1.8436,7.5145,0.4345,1.5461,4.269,1.0841,5.0955,5.0671,6.9219,1.1213,7.0953,1.2157,2.0333,5.6051,1.2778,4.7219,4.2349,3.5796,0.3331,4.8061,3.5427,1.1412,3.9585,1.3111,1.0063,4.6286,1.0103,0.853,0.5609,1.7058,1.1264,1.3603,4.4134,0.0116,2.6093,1.606,0.1089,4.5795,2.79,3.0224,0.2051,1.9761,2.619,4.5106,1.5855,2.6009,4.3166,3.5375,1.6551,2.0654,2.0536,7.1333,1.0196,3.0819,2.0031,1.7863,0.0725,1.4066,3.4898,0.9227,0.3122,5.2445,0.9884,0.739,1.0462,4.8167,0.6898,3.0798,1.4317,1.1558,5.6163,3.6168,6.4492,2.3523,0.9776,3.7054,4.5763,0.844,0.1001,1.8378,0.8928,0.6586,3.1217,1.0964,0.9467,2.3787,2.7061,1.723,2.76,4.5372,1.5688,6.2438,4.1193,0.8229,2.0708,2.1858,0.2995,7.7267,5.6908,3.5604,5.2634,2.4093,0.1173,2.4284,3.825,0.0186,1.559,2.7785,2.8439,1.3392,2.4475,10.0251,0.0524,3.3626,1.414,0.9483,1.376,0.6911,8.5304,4.3661,0.3775,1.0286,0.9312,5.2776,1.984,1.0124,0.1172,0.5975,3.9621,5.2913,0.7228,1.8229,1.1143,4.5588,6.816,0.219,4.0839,1.4969,5.5939,6.7988,0.5162,2.0804,0.1681,3.6602,3.4975,3.7902,6.1848,3.6191,3.274,0.8406,0.9153,3.8584,0.8977,5.9874,1.0699,1.0944,8.1643,5.1415,0.1715,1.2966,6.1476,0.2014,0.7095,5.1441,5.9643,0.0003,8.1513,2.9058,0.1143,0.9458,1.5619,2.8875,1.4203,6.7258,7.3509,5.6748,1.2988,0.3458,3.1204,0.9799,0.1759,3.9112,6.3437,2.899,6.0877,2.5756,0.4322]}

Club was very positive towards the episode, writing ``'I Am God'is probably the strangest episode since the original season of The X-Files. '' Other critics were less sanguine. Matt Fowler, writing for The A.V. Club described the episode as \" funny, but completely out of place \" on the show and wrote further that \" while it's a brilliantly weird comedy adventure, with a lot of jokes and some wonderful gags, it's just not the kind of show it is, and as a whole, [ it ] doesn't really do much for the series \". While some of the jokes and scenes worked well, it was not clear if the episode was supposed to be a spoof, an inversion, or something else entirely. The episode's humour was lauded by The Hollywood Reporter, who wrote that while it was \"not a laugh riot or even a funny, absurdist comedy \u2014 far from it \u2014 it still has the energy, ingenuity, and ambition to make a believer out of any X-Files fan.\"\n\nInternational broadcast\n\nThe episode was broadcast in the UK on BBC Two and in Ireland on TV3 on 3 March 1993 when BBC Two was not in its normal timeslot. The episode was repeated on 7 April on BBC 2 and 15 May on BBC 2 (UK channel). On 11 November 2011, the episode was aired again on the BBC 2 series The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson after it was re-aired as part of the The X-Files: The Complete First Season box set. The segment had been first aired on the BBC Two Channel in the UK on 22 May 1993.","token_len":347,"entropy":[8.8918,7.0349,2.0005,0.1336,1.5025,11.7031,1.2563,10.4811,1.2637,4.2817,0.4934,1.7462,6.8962,0.1148,0.0064,0.0054,0.0,7.5337,4.1298,2.1319,7.5156,0.3716,1.521,1.0258,3.2543,11.6958,7.4989,2.2358,7.2871,6.8596,1.6796,6.5149,5.6761,0.9352,6.7495,0.0021,2.0445,5.5623,2.1941,3.6236,4.6883,2.5624,2.4636,2.9534,0.0655,0.0091,1.8577,6.8495,7.1627,1.3829,1.5033,1.8049,6.8012,0.0142,0.0003,1.0908,5.6698,6.6514,0.7652,1.0764,0.1552,1.3113,3.785,0.0013,0.0003,0.0046,0.0321,3.9384,0.7956,0.4523,0.2763,2.8255,12.404,0.9582,2.5578,6.1361,3.9751,0.0965,0.737,7.9106,4.6496,1.4473,1.6467,4.0471,3.4045,7.5943,1.8152,2.8068,7.4728,1.9025,2.0299,1.9771,7.2714,6.033,5.2582,8.4574,0.5768,6.0385,1.5952,2.7263,0.1423,5.5916,1.5699,3.1797,5.2201,6.7657,0.0614,0.3708,0.6806,0.892,3.0595,1.1242,1.9914,1.6227,0.0816,1.2001,4.4062,2.7667,4.1848,0.8958,4.8234,1.5214,3.4951,1.0633,6.9025,7.4052,3.884,2.7138,0.0011,2.5877,2.9068,1.7001,1.1212,1.0224,3.7009,8.5534,5.165,2.5549,2.5996,0.4238,3.7753,2.8145,4.398,6.0813,1.0572,0.8193,3.217,1.5028,2.5225,5.7083,1.7036,1.1934,1.9449,1.2597,6.1716,0.0018,0.751,1.6395,5.6271,2.6989,3.3251,5.1359,3.2963,1.2676,0.2129,3.3402,1.7365,1.237,0.2278,2.6062,1.4759,2.3248,7.007,1.2459,9.421,1.7817,4.3438,3.8184,0.0021,1.1493,2.2221,1.9389,1.118,4.8625,1.1709,1.0709,1.6639,2.8739,2.1334,6.2573,7.0474,3.2812,4.1125,0.6063,4.8452,3.9626,6.4341,3.6302,2.8194,9.1705,8.4255,0.1642,0.0252,1.2401,0.4334,4.5487,2.3842,2.2119,4.9708,1.7316,7.277,0.5919,0.2947,5.5195,0.7557,1.9339,1.542,10.5627,1.5798,0.0443,3.1765,9.8528,0.0701,0.2578,0.2346,1.869,1.5927,0.0294,9.8627,4.8872,1.1798,0.0001,1.2521,1.0369,1.0943,1.4625,1.0169,1.7168,2.2191,0.6544,2.2887,1.823,2.1019,2.2258,4.1468,0.2556,4.8196,2.6236,2.0778,4.8009,2.7189,3.9636,6.0993,5.8042,2.0397,2.2897,4.9641,2.1014,3.7123,4.4418,5.9618,0.1103,0.5105,1.5139,0.4465,0.8335,7.3298,0.8968,6.3717,1.5388,4.6181,1.1929,4.4873,1.1717,5.8308,0.7573,0.1822,0.9893,3.4398,4.8898,3.9349,6.0721,1.404,3.3906,3.8009,3.854,6.6739,0.6727,1.4495,0.6403,0.4255,2.7304,3.8643,0.3379,2.5684,0.4942,2.6153,6.243,3.9823,5.5724,1.3019,0.0312,1.4246,2.8803,1.3456,5.5131,1.9008,0.7079,2.6869,0.285,0.722,3.4743,1.0688,0.0008,0.8799,4.5519,1.7889,0.0106,0.0083,2.5723,1.2403,2.7677,4.0887,0.2404,7.0326,0.0549,0.633,1.6605,6.0453,3.7763,1.6823,6.4628,1.6736,0.5229,2.1882,0.8142,2.4208,4.528,2.0409,1.9076,1.1455,0.8467,3.6497,2.3345,2.2194,0.8042]}

It is located in the central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in nave, with two entrances from the main floor and a staircase from the side.The interior, very rich in decor, is divided into two sectors with different heights. The upper part is dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament, with several chapels for the relics and some frescoes. On the lower level are the vestries and an altar room with the altar of St Thomas. Beneath the Choir is the crypt containing the tombs of the bishops of the diocese.\nThere were two choirs: the ancient choir and the present choir, which was restored in the 17th century. The former was dedicated to Saint James the Apostle, the patron of the church, and it included the first altar in the church. The later choir, built in the 17th century, was designed by Genoese architect and restorer Pietro da Cortona, who also designed and implemented several frescoes that adorn the church\u2019s interior. The ceiling of the old choir is made up of eight large frescoes showing events from the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, namely the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Passion.

Congressional meeting on July 9, 1905, requested a commission investigate the issue of a West Virginia flag. The West Virginia House of Representatives, on January 21, 1906, passed a resolution that recommended that a state flag be created. At a meeting of the West Virginia Senate, on April 29, 1906, it was decided to create a state flag. The flag was dedicated in Pittsburgh April 29, 1907 by President William Howard Taft in front of the Union Station, carrying the colors of the three Confederate states, blue, white and orange. It was accepted and displayed at the state centennial celebration at Mt. Airy, West Virginia in 1927.\nIn 1931, the West Virginia Bicentennial Exposition Committee purchased the West Virginia state flag for $10,000, which represented $40,000 in 1931 dollars. The West Virginia flag is blue containing an equal horizontal yellow stripe in the center and four diagonal yellow stripes in the corners. The stripes are parallel, and at top center, at the width of the flag is the color orange.\nThe orange stripes represent the Orange County (Kentucky), the Union (Virginia), and the White (North Carolina) Confederate States; blue, was originally the state color. By 1929, West Virginia had joined North West Virginia as part of the new Kentucky-Pennsylvania Territory, the flag was also designed so that the stripes were centered to represent the union of these three states under a common flag.","token_len":348,"entropy":[7.2375,0.6534,3.5724,5.1012,4.6338,5.2558,7.16,1.6293,6.796,1.2564,1.2955,6.9995,2.4737,2.3851,5.7756,4.5171,4.9363,7.1477,1.4758,10.6329,2.41,4.0813,4.0614,0.0431,0.6119,5.3621,0.6523,1.378,2.4899,5.6662,1.5129,1.6284,5.6449,6.7429,0.0007,1.187,3.1876,0.7463,7.1913,0.3547,3.4926,6.9356,0.0194,0.1191,0.811,1.9602,10.0585,5.6147,0.097,8.3383,1.6553,5.525,0.4534,6.2894,3.1038,0.0006,0.0035,0.0268,5.584,3.1534,2.2034,2.9073,3.4285,0.4047,2.1634,0.493,4.3283,1.3673,6.7846,11.0999,0.4372,2.5639,1.4799,1.8461,4.7517,0.0809,0.5095,1.1576,1.0202,2.9878,0.0111,3.0363,0.5338,0.162,2.49,2.9237,4.1014,3.4909,0.0195,0.4995,0.0847,1.995,0.6094,0.1443,2.1997,5.093,1.5522,1.884,2.3162,0.3186,0.3691,3.2544,1.2047,4.9052,2.5472,1.5007,0.5911,0.1173,1.8974,0.0166,3.7524,1.4689,1.6945,2.4913,3.5649,0.0082,1.2467,0.0094,4.6151,0.2711,2.2146,1.7424,1.1104,0.5456,1.7532,0.0268,1.016,1.3802,3.9599,0.7282,6.7992,1.9148,7.2819,7.0548,2.9628,0.3685,1.3459,3.4525,3.6634,2.508,1.7866,0.0047,0.0,3.0578,5.1813,0.0089,0.4312,4.4293,2.6932,2.1261,7.2554,0.4401,6.4005,0.1971,0.3776,5.2854,3.7503,1.5125,2.1894,5.6715,0.1338,1.6924,0.1791,6.82,0.1842,2.7305,0.3724,5.8947,2.4865,3.1681,1.7798,0.4452,3.961,12.2804,0.1078,1.4038,3.2436,7.5622,0.0143,6.8006,0.326,1.6483,4.6133,0.0846,2.7426,5.4074,0.2042,0.6926,2.5409,4.8106,0.2765,0.9433,2.01,0.0208,7.6221,0.0872,0.0039,4.8561,0.0065,3.9041,7.5719,0.945,2.2037,0.0124,3.3303,0.0692,2.6056,0.9981,3.2888,0.1995,0.1393,1.9587,2.2298,5.7775,2.1301,4.2659,0.1612,0.1074,1.2676,7.9276,1.1498,0.4188,1.0752,1.9062,0.0095,2.4721,2.9151,8.8593,11.1353,3.6627,6.2475,6.8147,7.5338,2.0836,4.1597,0.9642,0.7814,1.7458,5.752,4.5838,3.3871,1.215,1.0272,0.0689,3.9323,0.3727,0.7855,6.4948,0.8885,5.4544,3.23,2.2421,4.7919,5.5001,2.9969,2.1109,3.8825,1.9479,6.9586,0.1438,0.6681,3.0466,3.0381,1.0494,5.2461,4.1069,0.4806,1.7553,1.0951,9.5244,3.9499,3.7442,0.5682,7.7273,3.2023,3.9124,7.9856,0.0056,1.9784,2.0938,4.3482,2.7996,2.0348,0.5468,0.9627,0.3582,5.2608,1.9881,3.4423,0.0738,1.229,4.3831,0.1984,4.7071,4.9235,2.8474,9.185,3.5083,2.6314,2.1985,4.1062,1.8473,5.4851,4.6115,0.2637,3.6942,0.0101,1.1354,5.335,4.4555,8.3903,1.3145,1.0723,5.3668,0.0012,0.2506,5.4045,6.8081,3.6873,6.3162,0.0079,5.5479,1.6827,3.3036,7.4197,2.952,4.84,4.5838,7.8632,0.4425,1.2901,6.0252,1.6828,4.5099,4.4269,2.3254,0.4352,4.5014,3.4108,4.4313,1.9393,0.3608,5.9924,2.6128,2.7138,1.7884,0.3952]}

The building was named for General William Lenoir, first chairman of the Board of Trustees and founder of the institution. The first dining hall was intended only for students on the dormitory floor. The dining-room served as the dining room for students who wanted to eat in a quiet place away from the action. By the end of the 20th century, the dining hall was so successful with students that they stopped using the dormitory for dining. Today, the dining hall serves as a gathering place for students throughout the year for social functions. The dining hall is one of the few dining hall locations in the United States where the entire dining hall is available for reservation and private seating. Dining Hall is also unique as a place of social interaction since it is one of few that has a fully trained wait staff, a full bar and live music. The dining hall is also the only full-service dining facility at IU that allows for private music, dancing and a full bar.\nDining Hall is the highest rated dining facility at IU in nearly all categories, including satisfaction ratings.\n\"...

V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight @ - @ spored asci. Other conidia of the two species are indistinguishable.\nMELANDRYA FISCHERI F. BRUNI\nThis species is particularly distinct with respect to its peridium, which becomes white or tinged with red or pink before death and forms a crust. The colour of the crust changes with age, and at maturity it is usually black. Pileipellis is often white-ish or rose-pink.\nThe fruitbodies are small, subglobose, with somewhat prominent and rough outer surface, and a white-or pink crust of about 1 mm. in diameter at the base. A long spore-bearing tube may be present around the stipe.\nThe species is widespread in the Alps, most commonly on limestone rocks and sometimes on soil at the base of trees. It occurs commonly on limestone with a few white, thin layers. It was recorded for the first time in North America in Ohio by Lackey and Schatzmann ( 1954). The species is described by Frisch ( 1913 ) in Europe.\nMELANDRYA LAMBREDIANA BISHOP This species is known from North America. The fruitbodies are much larger, spindle-shaped, and reach about 15-20 mm. in diameter, with prominent, white or sometimes pink crusts. It frequently occurs in association with Sarcoglama schlechteri, which also affects limestone rocks.\nThe species is described by Bishop ( 1952).","token_len":348,"entropy":[10.5108,2.0476,6.2667,7.8659,8.1504,8.1853,3.6781,7.8016,2.9658,1.0922,5.8116,7.1084,2.2893,4.8104,6.2955,2.504,5.6516,0.216,3.2762,1.9323,2.9698,3.0465,6.1646,2.0216,0.8962,0.0126,3.9585,1.0481,3.1238,14.0524,0.0038,0.0006,1.9512,1.4235,9.2514,12.7505,5.5924,6.4184,5.7292,10.1068,8.1197,5.4995,6.3277,6.0985,5.444,6.3772,3.921,1.3191,5.7857,0.5328,0.8696,7.3981,1.5396,1.9554,9.6595,5.8129,5.8261,5.7366,9.1431,5.3778,3.3051,2.5645,1.2912,5.8387,5.4505,3.9966,7.5678,3.1351,3.8667,2.6186,3.983,1.5675,1.0059,6.3935,6.3869,4.7963,3.082,0.0014,1.1152,6.1797,9.0496,2.6774,1.6537,6.564,4.35,3.5992,5.8946,1.5336,1.5175,2.9278,2.9156,3.2658,6.0853,6.6955,3.1534,6.4111,0.6666,6.2279,2.6961,1.57,6.3557,1.701,0.5833,1.8771,4.0875,1.3147,0.5653,1.2372,1.6521,5.1138,3.2273,2.0527,1.8137,3.2465,2.6717,1.1979,5.7341,5.3465,7.4184,0.6695,1.4612,3.3854,4.2217,3.7327,4.4932,4.1248,2.7376,8.5048,0.6535,4.4951,0.0562,1.2577,1.8002,3.7693,7.1515,7.8642,5.1288,1.7081,4.1369,1.1079,7.2063,6.2211,1.9601,2.013,1.8327,3.2029,7.4588,5.1336,5.0912,6.4721,5.2413,3.9201,2.0057,1.5905,4.2215,3.9856,3.2169,6.174,4.4527,4.8095,4.6936,3.0332,1.9833,1.8334,2.1915,4.1538,0.4941,3.1649,0.452,1.2101,0.7808,3.5517,4.999,5.3756,1.8111,2.4089,3.766,4.6058,4.4003,0.4901,1.8883,6.1142,0.2225,7.2248,1.8679,1.4682,1.863,1.4628,4.5487,1.3811,5.2574,0.562,1.4642,4.7969,0.9562,5.3398,3.7829,3.0623,6.0201,3.3951,1.637,6.7154,1.1275,6.0495,5.3031,1.8917,1.7107,0.2238,4.8407,0.518,1.7416,3.6721,7.6465,1.9253,3.3625,4.941,2.1358,4.1028,6.534,4.4655,5.1133,5.2422,1.4572,1.775,4.7232,3.9345,5.235,1.8674,1.0736,0.0458,0.3791,5.9869,0.3555,0.635,8.3272,4.0378,10.061,2.6708,1.5473,5.3768,4.5903,4.4807,1.8148,10.243,3.0877,2.029,1.6503,1.0901,4.9278,1.471,7.1711,2.5648,1.5473,6.2277,2.5539,1.9385,7.0012,1.3902,0.9052,2.9858,0.8043,0.0402,0.1838,0.3432,3.0771,3.6288,4.5558,4.0054,5.002,1.6347,4.5673,6.6244,0.474,8.305,0.3655,0.4952,3.5894,1.2102,3.7712,0.3356,2.2488,2.0178,3.0745,0.528,0.0076,0.4278,5.694,1.5643,1.604,6.2774,3.1523,0.2037,0.453,0.5735,0.9313,7.103,0.9591,4.566,3.5439,0.5864,0.1622,1.5627,0.5065,0.3566,2.1071,2.0493,5.8646,2.8574,3.1328,1.9345,6.11,1.7462,3.3652,0.9526,0.6893,2.4615,6.857,2.9046,1.0266,8.4863,0.0197,6.7352,5.4894,10.9595,10.4982,8.3156,4.2495,3.6242,3.4797,0.7399,1.5296,2.2726,4.2438,6.714,6.6732,1.7513,0.7123,1.2931,1.2781,1.7369,0.5522,4.985,0.3256,7.8902,1.1394,4.8698,4.7203]}

Regular church services have not taken place in the building since 1996.\nAn old cemetery is located off the highway within the northern part of the Old Pine community. Two graves have been marked and preserved in a small grove of tall spruce trees. The location of this small cemetery remains unknown. It may be that the cemetery was moved after the village was laid out. There are two cemeteries for Old Pine, both located on the western slopes of Mt. Pine. All residents of the community now reside within the Mount Pine School District.\nSeveral outcroppings of igneous rocks have been found across the area around the Old Pine community. Most rock formations in the area are part of a larger suite of rocks that are known as the Bear Creek Plutonic Complex. The complex encompasses the area from Lake Superior to the north and as far west as Mackinac Island. The complex is underlain by the Lower Devonian Chinle Formation of liming conglomerates, marls, red and yellow sandstones. The outcroppings of igneous rocks on the Bear Creek Plutonic Complex are mainly of Early \u2013 Middle and Late Mesozoic age.\nOther formations include Silurian, Givetian, Aptian, Albian, and Cenomanian sandstone, limestone, shale, conglomerate, and shelly limestone, and arenaceous limestone.\nThe Bear Creek Plutonic Complex is the name given to an area that covers an area of approximately 500 square miles from Lake Superior to the north of Michigan. The complex is thought to be approximately 1 million years old.","token_len":349,"entropy":[4.0072,5.3617,0.1204,11.1545,9.2779,6.9836,2.8897,3.1768,6.1066,2.1151,5.3472,3.6371,1.3879,6.6819,0.6667,0.5726,9.0745,2.2002,0.4862,1.0264,5.6977,0.7054,3.0824,1.3426,0.6952,8.1514,1.8496,0.9955,3.6464,4.6604,5.0407,0.0483,1.6518,0.8283,3.8808,0.8917,4.2737,0.4075,0.6914,15.4487,3.1791,5.1067,1.8236,1.5726,5.3464,1.8716,4.4028,6.2225,0.7786,7.3052,1.379,0.0031,0.8483,4.9472,0.0383,4.4725,0.4659,7.1726,3.3029,2.0715,0.1009,4.7621,3.5514,6.061,1.8176,3.6075,3.5615,6.3375,0.0478,1.5785,6.4272,6.7973,0.1265,0.6397,0.985,1.3446,5.4281,0.5541,2.2087,3.4792,1.9499,5.0279,2.5951,0.6909,3.1151,3.8545,0.8686,2.1234,0.989,1.8506,0.6168,4.0122,4.4649,0.6981,6.5575,2.1514,7.2694,1.0999,2.0552,3.7019,1.1451,2.8017,4.9989,0.0136,0.0012,0.0,4.7047,3.9514,0.0145,3.0951,3.9683,1.9194,1.3581,0.6167,3.5307,5.3302,0.0502,4.416,0.0482,4.8751,0.7486,5.386,6.2052,0.7898,0.7784,3.6206,4.3438,3.1183,2.3402,0.7664,7.832,0.8049,7.6466,0.8077,0.6648,0.7061,5.6225,7.8575,4.3552,0.6924,1.7067,11.5913,0.0261,1.6498,1.6708,0.2114,1.8613,5.8549,0.2167,2.3072,4.4132,0.4864,2.7275,0.001,4.3213,0.7112,4.6295,6.073,1.8511,2.7341,0.3854,0.4695,0.8629,6.7823,0.0365,1.7924,3.2392,9.3299,0.0747,1.8804,1.7133,1.6327,2.9997,0.3452,2.879,8.9963,2.0286,7.2994,6.4756,2.3883,2.6224,0.342,1.3999,4.3825,5.2442,2.0985,2.5143,2.1104,3.9996,2.88,0.3496,1.2811,4.1113,1.8224,5.7717,0.0642,1.9984,0.0168,7.9189,0.5952,0.3944,3.2194,0.3722,1.2902,3.0827,1.0936,6.4799,1.084,0.0813,2.0408,6.1451,9.3155,0.3698,8.9024,10.4254,2.4407,4.2172,12.5087,8.0716,8.4834,0.0467,2.1845,9.8627,7.1819,0.2882,6.3794,3.116,2.3183,4.0224,1.2044,2.0968,1.2275,7.5736,0.0546,0.0441,1.4691,4.9391,0.0,0.4109,4.2233,0.6218,4.7491,0.0016,0.5798,0.0036,0.0045,0.015,0.9546,6.1243,3.334,9.7781,10.4847,3.9684,3.6749,0.6851,5.8736,0.4321,0.0083,2.3421,1.1248,1.4642,5.9092,5.4694,2.9835,7.687,1.1598,0.0855,1.8867,13.4427,4.9343,1.5296,0.3036,6.3862,4.7576,1.369,0.3158,5.5276,4.2856,0.7147,2.2436,4.1656,2.2504,4.2322,1.3233,6.156,0.981,3.2685,5.1418,0.629,5.7174,0.4745,7.2822,0.8991,1.2663,7.3675,6.9027,3.2178,3.7703,2.8276,11.5786,16.4818,2.9816,0.7668,1.6142,1.7027,3.3229,0.007,0.1405,0.0037,0.0055,0.0173,0.9161,2.651,6.2231,0.8009,0.1471,2.693,0.9552,2.6375,4.471,3.1805,0.0437,0.5596,2.5525,4.3762,0.9241,0.1478,4.6724,1.533,0.261,0.256,0.7006,1.7373,2.4363,6.4186,0.5385,1.2021,2.7016,1.1144,5.3051,0.0375,0.841,5.432,2.4173,4.1837,0.4931,0.0209,0.6978]}

Most virologists believe that HIV originated in the human population in the southern region of Africa.The virus spreads through the blood when it is a part of semen, vaginal fluids, blood plasma and breast milk.\nPeople with HIV are weakened and some die of an AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) due to illness due to the weakening of cells, especially cells that provide the body with the most important immune response. It is estimated that the AIDS epidemic has infected at least 60 million people in the world, including approximately 10 million in the developed countries., with more than 3 million in the developing countries. In the United States there are 2.4 million people with HIV, but it is estimated that only 150,000 of them know that they have it, since HIV\/AIDS is still stigmatized.\nInfectious diseases are a serious threat to human health. For over a century, the pathogenic action of the virus was understood only in part. The latest understanding of the mechanisms of a virus life cycle helps to predict the course of the disease caused by a virus.\nAccording to the pathogenicity of a virus, we have the lytic or nonlyaizing viruses, and their role in diseases is a source of infection.\nIt is important to know the characteristics of the pathogenic action of a virus in order to make effective antiviral remedies and prevent diseases. The lytic viruses destroy the infected cells after infection, while the non-lyaizing virus is unable to destroy the same cell until the action of the lytic virus in it.","token_len":349,"entropy":[7.591,7.1438,0.0118,0.0005,0.0003,0.0025,0.3274,10.0367,0.2234,1.3786,2.1398,3.0953,0.6064,12.3016,3.1575,4.1471,4.1696,0.697,3.8369,3.0854,0.6932,2.6279,1.1574,1.8107,3.3564,8.2399,0.0565,0.0012,0.0006,0.0005,0.5064,0.8467,4.9036,7.7684,0.0285,0.1467,2.6795,0.2368,1.203,8.4662,0.8839,1.1245,1.8109,4.5336,2.5523,1.0582,5.5422,5.2482,0.1149,0.7966,1.4213,8.4331,2.0068,4.8515,0.8132,1.9194,1.7694,5.8945,1.4176,1.5655,6.8105,3.5566,0.0055,5.0225,1.3716,4.314,2.0969,0.5859,4.2129,3.6276,1.5059,4.3135,0.1736,0.3604,4.4533,15.2806,1.4621,0.4286,1.7072,10.248,1.8947,5.9728,2.8055,2.3121,5.1659,2.1596,4.6869,2.5616,0.1752,0.0004,0.0004,0.0002,0.0493,0.9861,3.8032,0.0046,5.9648,5.4506,0.0069,2.259,9.4644,0.1836,6.4552,2.5005,4.3518,4.2807,1.3196,5.9268,2.0807,3.9225,0.0986,3.2602,4.78,4.4142,2.7195,1.4475,0.7771,4.1377,0.4587,2.5237,0.0407,3.2601,3.6345,2.4328,2.0422,3.2886,3.1713,0.0037,4.4203,0.5159,0.1349,1.6456,0.4606,0.6667,1.9313,3.2276,4.0117,3.532,0.8163,1.3864,0.851,4.0066,3.2089,9.8655,4.9536,3.1662,0.1864,3.4598,1.1738,3.3523,1.0042,0.1534,1.2578,0.7178,3.4079,1.3271,1.6961,0.027,4.5534,0.409,3.8472,0.5034,2.1678,0.1586,1.5307,0.9704,0.3369,1.555,3.6773,4.1368,0.2744,0.4273,0.0945,2.6718,6.9504,0.3346,0.0051,1.8993,1.2512,5.9246,2.9984,0.7691,0.757,4.145,2.3101,5.8392,3.0754,6.0136,0.024,0.6681,4.4359,6.1203,0.1134,1.8109,1.3026,3.8118,3.6235,3.3671,1.4677,1.5565,3.4446,3.4528,3.2867,0.1628,2.3809,0.3596,1.05,4.0855,5.4977,1.7662,0.4323,0.518,1.9783,6.4699,1.9379,8.0972,0.0529,2.2863,1.6946,3.2132,4.3635,4.3942,1.633,4.4938,2.8086,1.9031,6.669,4.9526,0.9023,0.7419,4.9044,1.2209,6.0173,2.6329,8.593,0.2565,8.2729,0.8061,5.4335,0.9749,3.2149,0.1089,2.2045,0.3823,7.1864,0.0432,2.613,2.2712,0.894,1.5923,5.642,0.0073,0.7134,5.8718,1.53,2.4073,0.9059,2.184,0.3442,0.516,4.9131,2.5851,3.3514,12.5132,0.5508,4.2249,4.7693,7.7743,14.4557,7.2079,6.096,1.4964,3.1011,5.2866,4.3944,0.476,4.8832,1.8355,4.6194,5.6847,0.042,6.4069,0.8216,2.5872,4.1689,0.304,1.6936,0.1589,2.9294,1.8311,5.2418,0.1619,0.9786,2.791,1.3899,5.0568,0.0897,0.8524,0.1151,2.8677,0.5175,0.0182,3.2323,4.3978,3.8683,0.035,7.6067,2.9666,2.2018,4.0605,0.7055,2.5147,6.0305,0.0172,2.5773,7.7042,1.2856,6.1603,0.5516,6.3222,2.4929,1.3619,3.3143,0.2981,0.144,2.2098,1.175,0.003,0.0267,2.3524,2.7849,5.0553,0.0061,1.1509,0.9717,6.8135,2.5903,5.445,1.0459,7.906,0.6694,0.315,2.311,0.0173,0.2891,4.5634,6.2972,3.779]}

The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days as well, though it is never seen or heard, other than in this single. It also features another of those headless men who appear elsewhere in Dream Days as well. The headless man was actually the character who played the role of the protagonist in the short film Dream Days, directed by Michael McNulty.\nThere was a short version of the music video directed by Steve Kelley himself, which was included on a downloadable DVD box. The song itself is featured on the soundtrack for the film, along with the other original songs by the Dream Days band.\nAfter the release of the single, it was reported that Dream Days was no longer going to continue as a full-length album. The final track, \"Fireflies\", was to receive a soundtrack in the film, yet it was decided to keep the four songs that were recorded instead of making any additions to the soundtrack. The DVD box set, titled Dream Days - The Complete Collection, included a re-mastered version of the original cassette tape to replace the boxed tape previously released. There were rumours that David Hasselhoff would sing a song for the film, however that was never confirmed.\nIn addition to his role in Dream Days, Hasselhoff would continue to appear in television and film throughout the early years. His first appearance before fans were his guest starring role in season two of the television show, Airwolf. Hasselhoff would continue to appear in the show from season to season for the next five years, acting as main characters in the third, fourth, and fifth seasons.","token_len":349,"entropy":[2.3898,8.2265,5.0343,4.9294,4.5315,7.0971,7.9948,2.9923,0.3636,11.642,2.0562,4.3551,1.5364,1.5151,1.8869,2.0159,2.5643,4.0109,2.2244,5.6944,3.6353,4.4507,4.0866,2.7763,7.2355,3.7159,7.2064,0.343,10.5178,5.6723,5.0471,6.3945,4.4213,6.4462,9.0044,4.3555,0.3919,3.4385,4.0244,2.1172,1.5719,3.4189,1.6465,4.1051,0.8268,4.6209,4.5266,0.0194,1.7368,4.7876,2.8941,0.5676,3.1705,2.4653,1.2241,5.479,4.6847,5.0233,5.6058,0.0515,1.9039,2.2157,2.8131,6.5268,0.795,2.6206,0.048,2.4239,0.3841,0.8304,2.5985,3.3657,0.0277,0.2707,3.1777,4.3837,2.6652,3.9854,2.8857,3.5131,0.9066,2.6747,0.1804,1.4908,3.8208,1.0623,0.7791,5.8163,2.1756,3.6227,0.6228,1.7158,7.6219,0.056,4.4919,7.4204,1.7978,0.7308,0.9656,13.3097,2.4069,1.5612,4.2285,3.6433,0.1928,0.7736,3.6009,0.8503,6.0311,0.0334,5.234,9.1015,7.2017,1.4523,1.6887,1.3818,3.7655,2.02,2.7463,5.9415,2.6518,5.3581,2.5234,1.7021,2.4917,4.8152,1.4428,4.9476,1.1677,0.5717,2.7689,1.8593,0.8819,2.4514,1.1657,3.5077,0.0011,1.2698,4.1896,6.2572,1.0373,2.9017,2.1819,3.7371,0.5044,3.3305,0.7102,0.7441,5.145,0.8773,1.6722,0.0806,1.285,3.1104,0.4822,2.7579,0.3739,4.3545,0.1956,1.9111,0.1754,2.7642,5.5327,0.0082,3.5243,0.1348,4.2579,2.749,0.7027,4.2659,0.6996,0.0871,1.2422,0.9557,2.235,5.947,2.5563,1.7158,0.4727,6.9976,4.018,0.7712,0.3782,5.2099,5.6904,0.6024,5.2341,4.7069,2.1497,7.9722,1.4891,6.7669,1.8223,0.4307,5.2497,0.9702,3.0633,0.9137,7.3678,1.6383,3.3406,1.0051,4.5331,6.1093,1.4371,3.9271,4.4589,5.4766,1.1379,0.4065,2.8615,0.4301,1.9742,4.8323,1.7487,3.5499,3.3242,3.763,1.7233,0.1882,3.639,1.9453,1.841,2.0519,1.0516,2.6138,1.7912,5.1938,0.4986,6.8564,0.0047,0.3637,0.1012,0.4915,2.4259,7.3176,2.3078,5.0001,2.5055,0.2628,9.1382,3.7494,7.7347,1.0305,0.8941,4.7541,1.6216,6.4091,0.4218,6.9385,5.9754,0.0079,0.0243,1.1421,6.7857,3.0017,2.131,1.582,0.4336,1.747,1.1329,3.1749,3.4254,1.0833,0.6397,0.37,0.6294,0.8017,2.9723,2.4816,0.3727,4.286,3.2515,1.7919,1.3431,0.016,0.253,1.2616,0.001,0.0013,4.5727,5.0052,0.5871,2.8367,0.5647,6.684,2.7298,0.7359,2.859,0.7836,5.5801,1.5779,4.7853,2.8018,2.7911,1.3409,7.0787,6.0627,3.9759,3.6526,4.997,5.0814,0.2616,0.674,6.5566,1.8354,0.4567,1.7133,2.3782,1.757,2.3982,7.4033,2.7025,0.653,3.0454,0.0005,0.0006,2.4361,4.331,0.3369,1.0156,0.5692,1.2143,2.9595,4.1537,2.4296,5.0433,0.009,4.2004,1.8008,1.427,2.6435,2.088,1.1506,6.1169,0.3898,6.2992,3.5135,1.3569,1.1038,5.4869,4.5493,0.2319,0.8804,0.5789,0.1436,0.1371,0.8966]}

Several common","text":"Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins can not be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common methods for the disaggregation of such materials are :(a) crushing and grinding ; ( b) maceration in organic solvents and hydrolysis in acid and alkali ; ( c) thermal treatment such as autoclaving at high temperature. While the first method is very tedious and gives good results in the case of microcrystalline materials, the second method is more efficient in the case of the polysaccharides and proteins but the hydrolysis by heat is accompanied by a great deal of undesirable side reactions. There are two ways of avoiding this objection, namely : (a) making a large amount of a cellulase enzyme, the degradation of which is known to be mild and specific, and use such enzymatic cellulolysis for destruction of the substrate; (b) by making small amounts of a celluloseolytic enzyme, which although mild, would still not overcome the great difficulties encountered in the thermal degradation of such polysaccharides. This procedure is known as biological breakdown. The cellulase enzyme was isolated from a culture filtrate obtained from a strain of cellullolytic bacteria, Acetobacter xylinum, of the genus Clostridium. Since the production of cellulase by such a species is quite limited, its recovery from fermentations of cellulose is difficult. To overcome this serious problem, the bacterial cellulase was immobilized on a substrate such as gelatin. In the present work the preparation and the preliminary characterisation of such enzyme immobilized substrate has been described.","token_len":349,"entropy":[8.2845,4.6397,1.3792,5.5608,0.0046,6.5276,0.9093,4.0538,0.0077,4.308,3.7714,2.6932,6.1083,1.2613,6.6541,7.388,0.2531,0.4886,3.1373,2.4334,4.3987,0.3063,4.9669,4.5501,4.5685,6.5354,5.485,4.3893,0.9571,0.1863,0.3689,2.1509,1.8628,3.3194,3.8367,0.3162,6.5217,5.0853,4.2615,1.6544,3.7882,7.9302,0.0756,0.0791,5.4045,3.1795,1.3316,17.2466,6.2137,0.4832,9.2179,2.3626,4.2948,6.8082,1.7558,6.904,0.1914,7.4835,9.1793,0.5603,4.211,6.2667,3.7521,0.4761,0.0013,2.1763,5.7849,1.048,0.3147,2.8039,5.7074,2.9607,3.0767,1.3451,1.3394,0.5183,0.5048,0.0092,6.487,4.8192,6.6161,0.0136,7.4364,0.6129,0.4094,5.539,1.8614,1.7189,2.7802,5.606,2.0964,4.6562,2.2513,1.427,4.1018,6.7492,1.1358,7.6888,5.5352,0.0178,2.5808,2.1277,3.1679,0.0236,6.066,2.9332,0.1287,0.1326,2.1448,0.5625,0.8106,0.4127,1.4199,1.1123,1.9888,2.3892,2.6103,0.9499,0.4733,0.0163,4.0845,5.4104,3.5139,0.0161,0.5725,1.9473,5.2561,5.6161,3.7428,7.2398,0.1297,0.0361,5.6739,5.1037,1.5366,8.9277,0.0569,1.8545,4.4972,2.0437,0.1218,7.3585,2.303,5.2275,0.8836,4.7998,0.5143,2.038,3.6,0.9111,6.3446,2.3918,8.6477,2.4448,3.3598,2.978,0.9708,1.0417,0.0039,5.3389,2.1762,3.5735,2.2135,0.0201,3.5941,5.9451,6.7029,4.1225,2.5336,5.2336,6.2808,0.5568,0.4275,1.1295,6.1273,1.3884,1.0827,10.5173,1.4646,8.0697,2.1729,1.3473,6.5692,5.8321,5.3531,0.0011,0.027,10.025,5.463,0.1926,4.4554,8.1549,0.3188,1.86,5.2744,3.1779,0.8948,0.0133,0.0012,3.4656,2.8152,2.7434,0.5297,0.028,0.9225,1.976,2.3454,10.3574,2.0496,0.341,0.7837,1.5389,8.5637,4.3614,1.4759,5.7022,3.3928,3.5618,6.8571,0.3498,6.63,3.3241,3.1339,0.9945,1.0478,9.1205,3.241,0.4392,3.1477,4.2515,0.0273,0.0013,0.0377,1.4694,3.1783,4.0917,1.0457,2.9734,0.2134,8.3485,5.2451,1.2153,1.946,4.2413,0.7857,0.3118,4.8849,5.3186,0.8448,2.0679,7.4096,8.8401,0.7441,0.0845,6.0462,0.248,1.3725,7.219,0.2625,7.434,8.8882,9.3852,0.3523,2.7966,2.14,7.6237,3.6429,1.355,0.042,4.9786,1.5845,7.0389,2.0149,1.4231,5.0534,0.8433,1.6512,4.5725,0.0867,0.0006,0.0189,1.2177,5.1688,1.1528,6.108,0.1488,1.0711,1.4685,2.3453,4.1936,2.2219,3.8022,0.8131,3.716,2.6753,0.4984,3.4321,6.7064,1.9755,8.6142,1.0483,2.6554,1.7491,0.1141,1.6329,3.3031,0.895,4.0185,3.9773,0.6925,7.32,0.9227,0.5537,1.3326,5.2625,2.9055,0.3037,2.6169,6.8677,0.0381,3.3761,0.989,4.3796,5.083,0.0287,6.4956,2.2303,2.8652,1.4831,3.4139,2.6944,2.1031,6.2261,4.1367,3.3685,8.6648,6.2647,3.5899,0.0961,4.5484,5.7371,12.2163,2.2675,6.447,4.9443,0.1282,2.1518,0.5512]}

Nanking itself was surrounded by formidable stone walls stretching almost one mile around it. Three miles inside the city walls were the most heavily fortified portions of the city -the gates themselves, the northern wall in the section known as \"The Red Zone\" and the northern wall in what was referred to as \"the black zone'. Most of the remaining city was lined with a series of stone walls, some as high as 5 feet with stone spikes. It was the entire city, literally, that had to be fortified. With food, wood, and water in short supply, Nanking suffered two devastating fires over the course of the winter of 1937-1938.\nOn December 13, 1938 the Japanese began their attacks on Nanking. The first major assault was made on the northernmost portion of the city -the wall known as the \"Red Zone\". At 0600, the Japanese first encountered only a handful of Chinese soldiers who were unable to resist and were forced to surrender at 0645. After this initial attack, the Japanese, led by General Ito, attacked the area along the northern wall, where it met the city. On the other side of the wall, General Kuroki and two battalions attacked the western portion of the city. Although the Chinese defended the city with determined bravery, they were unable to hold off the Japanese for long periods of time. When the Japanese captured the western part of the city in October 12, 1938 they found many things that piqued their curiosity, including an important archive of the military in which vital information about how to operate troops in Nanking was located.","token_len":350,"entropy":[8.0095,3.3182,5.048,5.9822,6.5612,3.9534,11.5908,0.9581,8.5973,0.1334,2.9198,7.8573,4.167,1.6723,10.7404,0.0833,8.2535,8.9096,2.1308,1.03,2.4565,8.8311,2.5715,0.1622,0.1554,0.8396,0.9524,0.4488,4.1409,0.0032,6.6265,0.7982,4.4722,0.5096,6.715,8.0088,0.3397,6.6274,4.9909,5.1619,1.6075,5.2415,4.1807,0.667,6.3336,4.3275,5.8975,1.1226,0.2779,4.2012,1.6243,2.0659,5.8079,3.8677,0.6255,5.1313,0.1095,0.3993,0.9182,5.1458,7.4623,5.5251,6.2749,1.431,1.0071,8.5285,3.4741,4.8685,0.7773,9.2512,4.1744,0.0694,2.2963,2.3699,5.3883,4.533,1.5563,0.7448,0.2452,2.7361,0.8049,1.2977,7.1262,1.527,4.1125,0.0072,0.5732,0.7759,2.1067,6.0226,0.2166,10.9363,6.018,0.2575,0.3593,4.5419,3.9952,2.2691,6.2949,0.2355,4.4109,2.2686,0.0006,4.0432,1.673,1.5491,2.9675,4.2708,0.983,0.006,4.3295,1.9864,6.5909,4.4789,4.888,2.3496,3.9058,0.3994,2.7973,6.3932,1.0442,2.7811,6.1717,0.6477,1.8701,3.0818,2.622,0.1213,3.2224,1.0927,4.8737,8.3714,1.9941,7.9896,0.5916,1.1515,2.7933,3.4565,1.9471,0.0015,0.4431,2.9447,0.0039,4.8832,6.1187,4.1439,5.4296,5.0197,0.5586,1.5269,0.0004,1.1825,3.5451,2.6435,3.8681,0.7451,2.237,0.2439,0.5357,2.2837,6.1412,1.4306,3.4976,0.9991,3.6863,1.9524,3.7398,3.4928,2.5893,5.1625,0.5796,1.2103,0.006,0.75,1.6935,2.4545,3.8968,4.5631,1.5692,2.6702,1.0153,1.3874,3.7197,4.1428,2.8984,0.0272,0.2269,0.1041,2.4891,0.6751,6.3149,2.3848,0.0326,1.4068,0.5401,2.3611,0.1598,0.531,3.8918,6.2413,1.8473,2.8814,0.8716,0.7691,6.6187,5.2249,5.357,1.571,2.7919,0.0038,2.5802,1.9071,2.9156,1.4406,5.1847,0.0155,3.3771,3.2393,2.3376,1.6026,0.1877,2.7971,3.7744,7.7919,3.2856,0.5718,3.7356,3.1242,2.7567,2.1806,0.8504,0.8856,1.6842,5.1116,2.7369,0.0175,1.8304,7.1278,0.6933,2.16,4.3848,1.0589,5.471,5.0116,0.5984,3.0381,2.2745,2.1202,3.7022,4.2717,6.0067,1.2716,4.1047,3.2865,2.9039,2.0114,3.0571,0.1825,0.1081,0.1268,1.2042,0.8965,5.3135,8.9108,3.4409,2.566,4.283,6.9864,0.0002,7.1849,0.87,3.9998,2.2074,0.1868,0.1918,0.1492,1.1114,5.0241,1.0702,2.6363,6.4926,2.1428,2.7948,3.0533,10.3614,4.2632,0.3681,1.6392,0.7816,2.0076,0.0056,2.7141,1.6877,0.3795,0.7472,3.0715,2.6235,4.003,0.2999,0.0167,0.4731,4.418,0.672,0.9493,4.5999,0.668,1.3341,2.3171,0.0501,0.2922,0.0919,2.668,3.9853,9.2687,0.8232,2.207,3.7232,4.8744,4.3517,6.9702,1.518,9.2751,0.4844,0.0002,0.1749,3.0528,2.5264,1.295,3.5071,3.8487,9.1707,0.9378,2.1835,4.7178,6.6038,4.11,8.2354,0.9598,1.8796,4.8438,1.6859,4.1967,6.5748,2.6674,2.7333,0.0078,0.6973,3.5278,0.1791]}

The most remarkable change is that any of the multiplayer modes, including co @ edit, co-op versus, and deathmatch, are now the standard co @ edit and co-op versus. Before the re re release, co-op versus modes for the original Perfect Dark were only featured in the Perfect Dark Collection which is a stand-alone downloadable content pack for the original game. The game has also received four new level layouts and three brand new levels. The gameplay has also been remastered to increase the visuals and game quality, and will provide players with increased compatibility with newer hardware.\nThe new gameplay mode features both the original two-player co-op and a brand new feature called \" Team Battle \". The new team battle mode has two players who must work together to defeat four enemies, but if an enemy knocks the pair of players off their platforms they both fall the same platform and die. If one gets killed or knocked off their platform by an enemy, his or her teammate must immediately dive into the water to avoid the loss.\nIn one version of the co-op mode, players control two separate figures simultaneously, one controlled by the user on either side of the other.

Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures made by Gaozong, stating that the government should adopt a more stringent military strategy with the enemy. In June 1139, Gaozong summoned the chancellor to see to it the city of Luoyang were not evacuated, and on 30 July approved an agreement with the Jin which included the surrender of the provincial seat, Luoyang, into the hand of Zhang Jianzhu and sending the military governor of Lu to surrender his office to his brother Zhang Jizhong. Zhang Jizhong and his brothers also had to agree to renounce the Jin position as emperor and empress and to have their sons, all in the imperial palace, sent into exile from the capital as well, but to retain their positions of minister and chancellor.\nFollowing the initial negotiations, the peace treaty was not honored by the Jin Emperor Jingzong. In 1140, Emperor Jingzong ordered one of the three empresses to have their sons, the Prince Qi and the Prince Li, sent into exile outside of the Imperial capital. Following a disagreement between them, one of the Emperor Jingzong's aides forced the Emperor Jingzong to make a second statement which stated that the surrender agreement could not be changed. On 31 January 1141, the Jin sent an army which attacked the capital, killing the governor of Lu. In July, Emperor Jingzong made a third statement, rejecting the earlier treaty and sending his third son, the Prince L\u00fc to serve on the Central Military Command of the Jin.","token_len":351,"entropy":[9.0532,7.0083,2.715,11.2427,8.718,4.8954,1.429,3.8354,8.9615,7.4953,2.0608,6.3747,0.6908,0.9853,0.6382,0.0826,12.1295,4.6282,1.7514,6.9915,3.8265,8.2139,5.9584,2.6999,5.7464,4.1571,5.2817,3.1532,0.251,0.5532,0.9808,4.8811,4.3297,0.3581,0.0033,4.7588,4.9634,6.4307,9.6763,1.7366,8.2527,8.5408,0.2651,2.3174,0.2547,6.8324,0.0589,0.023,0.0017,1.9726,4.7617,0.1919,1.7214,4.1289,2.4143,5.9008,1.1401,1.6768,6.7366,5.0491,2.8555,4.8758,1.548,6.6015,1.487,3.4339,6.5793,1.2643,1.7805,0.375,2.3523,0.0039,0.0018,0.0029,4.9459,1.8634,8.7068,2.3272,5.1609,5.1322,0.8454,5.0656,7.3827,2.6354,5.345,1.0913,0.0046,6.6315,2.4273,6.2808,2.2639,1.4064,5.1597,5.1692,2.4358,8.1079,3.2601,1.5224,1.3219,0.7598,2.7078,4.2577,2.5222,1.291,3.3083,0.1034,1.4686,6.1655,6.7124,3.6135,2.5784,0.0759,0.0206,1.648,4.7691,0.5343,5.1877,0.0291,6.0177,5.0138,3.5809,1.3535,2.446,8.732,1.6015,5.6659,6.3172,1.9754,1.0802,13.1897,6.5306,3.4469,4.502,1.7081,3.8851,2.2581,3.351,3.5264,2.0573,2.7912,0.2017,0.3924,3.1762,1.6173,0.0025,0.0033,0.0029,3.3337,1.4998,5.4001,3.4241,4.2328,2.0488,4.5066,0.3642,4.907,0.0107,1.7622,4.9477,7.1904,3.3253,3.5217,1.6061,8.3169,0.5871,2.4416,1.8239,5.273,1.2173,4.1122,3.2405,5.362,3.6114,1.6339,4.3624,1.7661,1.2572,4.6797,3.3743,0.1763,3.4439,0.8569,3.0169,3.9686,2.4146,2.8988,3.5138,4.3067,4.7566,0.9535,2.4933,2.8425,7.6423,0.773,4.2496,0.8939,1.8031,11.523,0.7958,5.2851,4.6843,0.7956,1.3367,4.7741,2.7282,0.6495,4.6161,4.896,2.0894,0.4629,3.2993,6.0092,8.4545,3.9262,3.5805,1.4507,2.6129,1.7689,1.6777,0.4109,5.768,0.583,0.0174,0.0055,2.6544,6.5478,0.7476,0.8809,4.1227,5.4259,1.0486,0.907,1.1336,5.0521,2.1123,2.1174,1.9606,3.3597,5.9568,7.8116,3.6551,0.6249,2.3429,3.7573,1.16,1.3749,0.5834,0.0124,7.9883,1.3284,0.9264,4.96,2.6194,1.1454,5.284,3.3692,5.0899,1.5254,3.5769,0.5245,5.038,0.2366,0.4291,6.0499,3.5921,0.0018,0.0093,0.1382,4.0562,6.8293,0.9402,4.5424,1.3324,0.0078,0.0044,0.207,4.2398,1.0822,4.8134,5.0838,3.8651,2.8289,0.3079,1.0734,6.1416,6.3158,3.9799,0.601,0.2043,4.8041,1.6085,3.5276,2.852,2.7031,0.2467,0.1965,0.1059,1.1376,3.5848,4.126,3.1236,2.4121,5.5528,3.0721,0.8242,2.4888,1.95,2.3181,2.6217,4.5808,0.8577,0.2297,6.7177,2.8287,5.2365,1.3676,4.8841,0.108,0.0012,0.021,4.5506,0.8318,4.2769,0.388,1.8716,7.5855,0.3616,5.6203,6.5123,1.4274,4.5317,2.4606,6.362,1.8181,0.597,1.0171,0.8582,5.9813,5.2888,6.1246,5.3862,3.8787,0.3306,6.5463,2.4284,4.0724,3.0156,0.2864,1.9759,0.622]}

It is a songbook of the kind that the original group recorded ( and then changed its name to the group that recorded more of that recording ) and that was given new life by the group that recorded the album after the death of, `` The Real Estate. ''\nI am interested in trying this out, and I was wondering: does anyone have an idea of how to make a good version of the game? For instance, have you tried to play it in more than one computer at the same time? Are you running the game in a windowed mode or some other way? In this new version, which one of the modes? For instance, the new one is in a maximized window, while the original one is in a full screen window. Any ideas on running it in a maximized window would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.\nWhen playing through the levels in the tutorial, make sure that you activate the'record the next movement' option. This will create a file that you can load and play again to see if you missed a level or skipped over anything. It also allows you to get a clearer idea on what was right and wrong with each level, so you can fix them and practice them until the controls feel comfortable.","token_len":351,"entropy":[7.0281,3.3098,10.9419,3.2394,9.825,6.4211,8.0739,3.2594,1.5758,2.9884,11.1686,14.882,3.6975,0.4515,0.2463,7.4668,7.4956,2.1198,2.3061,1.4214,2.8654,9.1012,1.8887,1.7828,2.6787,1.4605,3.8857,1.6506,10.705,12.3128,3.109,1.7446,7.9564,2.2439,3.2969,4.8855,0.9648,4.4316,2.4243,0.4333,7.9663,3.7999,5.3267,3.4282,5.5246,2.1486,4.8521,4.2325,2.1643,3.669,4.0338,3.8976,0.9297,6.6302,2.8591,0.9893,3.1276,10.6473,2.5807,2.7664,0.4709,3.2187,0.0188,0.3957,7.3964,4.6749,1.8478,0.8769,5.2886,5.2865,0.2498,0.9484,4.9206,3.1904,3.4785,3.6923,2.2054,2.5515,0.6872,0.409,9.567,0.7912,5.0815,2.3775,3.3764,0.0025,0.6658,4.0805,3.1898,0.159,1.4678,3.5944,5.6632,0.6596,0.6418,3.3138,1.7338,2.5668,0.971,1.5824,4.012,6.0717,1.8167,2.2576,4.9415,0.9194,3.5819,4.5057,2.4708,3.0222,5.935,6.3563,4.7903,4.9918,4.7894,0.6596,0.7215,1.7958,3.0179,3.4991,1.7751,7.1006,1.9572,4.1181,5.1417,3.4819,1.1461,2.5117,2.1967,5.4741,5.0429,1.1878,1.1176,1.1009,2.3395,4.4007,1.5121,1.6168,2.4802,4.4482,1.9818,1.3436,0.0571,7.4412,6.0158,2.4957,6.5571,6.585,2.9202,4.039,4.0845,6.3012,2.9056,5.7994,0.417,5.8946,4.5763,1.7064,1.8875,1.4615,1.1757,4.5932,3.2295,5.7679,5.1594,3.0125,1.5668,2.7823,1.2355,0.8518,1.3823,1.9768,1.8942,1.4295,4.9511,3.6134,0.2809,1.7947,6.5555,1.4169,5.2911,2.7378,0.0988,4.8031,0.2749,1.5827,2.4725,3.3567,1.9595,2.0436,6.9197,1.1791,0.1695,6.3926,4.9918,2.1506,0.0446,0.006,0.5716,4.9396,0.8213,5.3878,2.2399,1.7825,1.9028,1.7878,5.2487,1.2505,2.6707,1.9978,5.7375,0.6645,0.9264,0.7321,5.1901,3.4008,6.4356,2.0088,0.7011,5.1059,7.6813,1.377,1.1343,7.0135,5.7273,5.0142,1.3708,0.1089,2.9944,4.588,4.3504,1.8826,3.7701,1.8432,9.8398,0.8422,2.221,1.952,3.0577,0.2692,1.7785,0.6394,0.674,0.5475,0.4083,3.7287,1.793,2.0302,0.4614,5.1604,1.9432,1.9871,7.8309,1.6339,0.5016,1.1987,4.8535,0.0032,0.4006,2.6342,0.1839,2.304,1.7595,0.5541,3.5149,2.4597,0.0079,1.4829,1.6439,6.2272,3.5922,4.6427,0.7701,6.0989,2.7478,1.2952,5.6414,0.6729,5.9606,0.0524,1.7708,0.6992,7.1094,0.6288,12.7541,4.9571,4.8843,6.89,4.251,10.2632,10.705,7.4723,1.3294,2.5758,1.1831,4.4513,0.4477,6.1005,2.4718,1.9744,0.1768,4.0444,2.5101,1.7634,4.7406,4.2809,2.6157,2.1693,0.7309,5.2616,2.4434,4.491,1.7452,4.668,3.6539,6.0236,0.4863,3.1452,2.617,2.6874,0.2377,0.0308,4.4986,1.5999,5.5349,1.0429,3.8284,1.2355,4.8128,6.7461,1.5,0.6694,2.5637,2.3432,0.6465,2.0577,1.6891,1.0292,0.3942,6.0897,3.2642,3.4691,7.3215,1.9115,5.1789,2.9693,8.5911,4.6308,4.0593,0.6479]}

From 1936, it was the home of RAF Uxbridge, which operated a detachment of fighter aircraft, with its facilities on the grounds.\nFollowing the Second World War, Uxbridge was used to house the Royal Aircraft Establishment at RAF Station Uxbridge.\nThe site of Uxbridge's main airfield, the former Uxbridge Army Airfield also housed part of the Eastern Air Command headquarters and a flying school.\nWhen Uxbridge closed in 1975, the site was turned over to the Department of Defense Services and developed into the British Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. In 1993, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust acquired the house as well, and it has been the principal centre of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWhen the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) was opened in 2007, the Uxbridge estate was turned over to LSHTM as part of a deal which gave the institute access to use the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine buildings that stood on the Uxbridge campus.\nIn 2010, the college of St George-Hyslop University College acquired the Uxbridge House Estate and started to operate the college's Sixth Form Centre based there, named St George Hyslop Uxbridge Sixth Form Centre.","token_len":351,"entropy":[7.5638,3.6541,5.6178,11.4928,9.6994,4.1832,0.0127,2.1272,4.5335,3.5402,0.004,0.6543,8.5905,0.4217,10.5984,3.5869,0.0551,4.869,0.6393,6.4835,4.2553,0.5264,6.9327,0.9438,0.915,2.252,4.8105,2.1783,1.8764,3.1109,0.0765,9.9608,6.4704,1.6207,1.7571,1.6649,9.5053,8.1779,1.0789,1.9824,0.7415,6.3612,0.6871,1.2828,11.7993,3.728,1.3024,3.6599,1.2058,1.2242,3.2402,0.2468,7.9809,0.2159,2.3549,0.6842,2.9809,2.9947,3.7485,4.9898,0.5476,4.617,0.8705,1.7104,4.5867,1.4805,0.7613,1.6836,7.1634,0.9508,1.2933,2.4432,0.0961,3.5885,0.7681,5.9033,7.2297,2.053,1.4652,0.6943,3.6706,1.8723,0.0557,6.7791,2.8626,0.0118,0.0004,1.457,1.9582,5.2012,2.7443,7.2873,0.1875,5.2084,1.7317,2.1917,4.5643,3.4833,6.8953,3.3983,0.9671,3.8411,2.7418,0.56,6.4295,0.7115,3.5476,0.0081,0.0012,0.2119,3.5313,0.002,0.0007,1.203,3.3528,2.2227,3.1491,1.5859,1.7628,4.6886,2.6473,3.5985,1.283,7.3689,6.8571,0.0328,0.0194,1.6516,1.2011,1.6948,3.302,2.1115,2.2955,0.0031,0.0012,2.7111,4.8093,3.7002,0.8859,1.6846,2.5013,5.0665,4.9307,0.1668,0.0296,5.9629,1.9957,0.5471,6.5283,3.5608,7.0007,0.0038,0.5134,9.1778,2.2275,3.5414,4.6218,2.7492,2.4999,6.8584,1.5207,0.6907,0.7325,5.4057,3.4348,0.0082,0.0007,4.1428,0.5831,5.1751,0.2787,1.2303,2.2271,0.6879,4.9364,1.1641,0.0314,0.5882,4.4036,0.058,3.3868,8.9555,3.0717,7.0148,0.9105,1.3815,4.0851,4.6126,0.0451,6.3733,2.7361,7.5129,0.2274,1.0935,3.95,4.622,0.2452,0.8165,6.2652,5.7698,8.1148,5.4138,0.9657,0.5935,2.7357,0.3693,6.6241,4.0331,4.4482,2.5109,1.2974,2.054,2.0776,1.181,2.7438,5.8754,4.6807,0.3741,2.6744,2.995,1.3633,0.469,1.7504,0.0734,0.8275,3.5957,1.2005,4.5342,2.1903,0.0334,1.787,0.0025,0.3274,0.0001,0.0034,0.8246,0.6615,5.563,1.2263,6.2029,0.358,0.2115,0.0058,0.0,0.0579,0.0004,0.0014,3.46,1.8879,1.8158,0.0436,0.0392,1.2662,3.379,0.3369,3.4258,0.2067,1.1449,4.6378,0.0072,0.0009,3.9146,0.6275,4.8028,0.2842,0.0698,8.4854,0.0016,0.0128,2.9962,0.4916,0.0013,1.2803,3.9399,3.2814,3.9634,0.9483,4.6136,3.1194,0.0171,8.1328,0.7805,5.5405,0.233,0.2253,0.0022,0.0,0.0294,0.0026,0.0022,6.5068,5.7938,6.3435,1.5994,0.4375,5.2646,0.0019,0.0014,4.6654,0.4362,0.6053,2.3797,2.7439,0.1109,0.6343,6.546,3.5849,5.5176,2.9525,6.7844,3.3342,8.4476,1.5739,0.0254,3.1959,6.394,5.7635,0.3437,1.5168,0.0023,0.0005,4.6357,7.5871,2.4034,5.6707,2.3642,4.3147,1.4113,3.7964,1.6966,10.8595,3.3508,3.9747,8.3385,3.0536,2.4477,7.1251,4.8138,0.2149,4.3007,0.1286,0.0674,0.0054,4.7273,0.1567,0.0025,9.2969,0.1017,1.2757,0.6175]}

A similar celestial sphere appears on the 1593 English Bible illustrated by John Flamsteed and shows four planets, all in orbits.\nThe earth is also often the centre of attention in Christian art. For instance, on a painting in the collection of the British Museum depicting St Paul as a teenager in the second century A.D., he appears to be in the center of a spherical heaven. Also, in the 1670s, the famous artist, Hans Holbein, created a unique and intriguing depiction of earth surrounded by an immense circle of celestial bodies.\nHermione's Scream and The Scream are two short stories by Mary Shelley both published in the first four volumes of the novel \"Frankenstein\", as well as the collection of stories \"Inferno\". Hermione Granger's scream was the first major incident of the plot of the second movie, as her being able to summon her dead mother's ghost was used to further the plot.\nCancer, or cancerous tumours, can affect any part of the body with the most common places being in the lungs, ovary or stomach. The most common type of cancer causing pain is breast cancer.\nCancer is not just one thing, it could be lung cancer, liver cancer, throat cancer and many other types of cancer. There are many types of cancer, some will spread throughout your body, some will only be in one part of your body and cause no pain or discomfort.","token_len":352,"entropy":[12.6891,3.3298,7.652,0.9564,0.0022,3.2635,8.8088,4.7459,1.28,0.6926,3.8521,0.5168,9.019,6.8267,0.6131,0.0129,1.9881,0.758,3.7105,3.3879,9.5565,0.0391,0.0014,0.0203,2.8077,0.0319,3.2156,6.3783,2.3149,4.6631,1.4872,0.7891,2.9025,0.3617,0.1747,3.4452,3.6099,1.965,6.872,4.6143,1.072,4.6199,4.6518,0.3405,0.805,5.6938,4.7778,0.6514,0.6703,8.7162,1.3143,3.6704,1.0693,0.8591,5.5955,0.5724,1.7597,0.41,0.227,1.1548,0.4306,5.0701,4.3074,9.2755,0.6563,6.2734,3.0004,0.8042,7.0604,7.4682,6.7,3.6568,9.5003,0.8704,3.5757,12.4175,3.8058,2.2675,2.7217,7.0812,6.3027,3.4443,2.2246,3.617,2.9984,4.6845,4.5187,1.6681,6.3811,4.4748,1.7681,3.299,5.4207,5.7714,2.5951,0.0521,4.6733,1.6104,4.0393,6.6935,1.1932,4.3358,2.0404,0.2152,3.9531,2.8806,1.9719,3.2692,1.2118,6.032,0.1717,1.4033,4.5032,0.6118,5.1669,5.7935,2.8163,5.0949,0.9995,7.2504,2.6131,1.6562,5.0076,0.2454,1.5184,0.0002,0.0059,0.3128,4.5504,3.6943,1.2735,0.9875,3.436,1.1499,2.2145,0.1727,2.3897,6.4615,5.9324,1.3087,5.038,1.1289,1.4176,1.097,3.27,4.1337,2.132,0.6152,2.1971,4.8745,4.7515,3.4523,6.6327,4.8641,2.7126,0.113,0.7181,3.6032,0.6911,6.4709,3.7299,6.0037,2.8125,0.0965,6.1963,6.7225,0.0455,3.1688,4.2853,4.0173,0.7237,4.974,2.502,1.0336,1.5259,10.3587,3.0739,4.0515,13.8429,3.9829,3.6186,6.0331,8.4641,2.4761,7.059,0.9605,1.9647,3.4172,1.8418,7.9598,1.9043,0.5876,1.7819,5.0263,5.2159,0.6383,0.0736,1.2063,5.8582,3.796,8.4238,0.1552,3.8894,4.1906,0.2927,0.0037,2.0684,5.7886,0.2179,3.5717,4.3464,9.3204,0.5551,3.8742,6.0389,6.7366,2.2489,2.8501,2.7286,2.6668,1.5076,5.425,7.6778,1.0777,1.6374,6.6258,1.1539,0.9439,4.6625,7.7851,1.6687,3.6611,3.4647,6.8659,4.9769,0.0047,5.1422,2.6105,4.9802,2.574,3.1327,1.5522,2.33,4.3716,0.8306,5.1741,1.4755,0.4505,0.8857,1.2526,5.7292,5.2959,3.4003,4.9214,5.2843,3.9763,3.5159,0.0893,0.3371,2.1463,3.445,3.7762,1.2746,0.0132,0.3276,0.1013,5.8389,2.0823,5.0158,4.0071,10.2837,0.5033,2.9579,0.2132,3.3104,0.4526,6.9797,5.2612,4.5919,2.0297,0.4836,2.1883,2.4803,0.2169,4.633,0.1625,0.1941,6.4138,5.9175,0.7062,4.2162,0.3545,0.8663,1.9517,2.538,0.1508,1.4079,3.3153,3.3865,4.3119,4.8923,1.4262,1.6057,5.5305,0.6154,9.7709,0.1772,1.1142,3.6137,0.1809,0.4273,5.1018,0.0487,2.4591,3.588,0.7694,2.1549,0.1929,0.8151,0.4259,3.6486,0.4348,1.3205,2.6102,0.1087,0.738,1.4939,2.4969,5.9396,3.2727,3.7907,2.4698,0.0679,1.2534,1.0087,0.3365,2.9772,1.6679,3.1385,2.3144,2.378,0.2289,0.5994,0.0386,1.598,4.6931,3.7384,3.2842,2.151,1.8601,0.5005]}

Common","text":"Pichilemu has several expansive dark sand beaches. The water is cool all year @ - @ round, and many tourists choose to swim at the shore break during the summer months. Common features are fish eagles, pelicans and a diverse avian life for a closer look. In the winter there are several waterfalls.\nLocated only 200 metres from local accommodation, a public toilet is available. The beach is easy accessed & well kept. Toilets are free, so you would not have to pay for your swim.\nThe beach is free, and if you go in late at night no problem.. as long as it is by a group of at least 5, people will move it. The beach is quite crowded on weekends, and no problem as well. There are some people that go surfing at the beach break ( about 6 miles east to the main break ) and at night time they have quite a few boats moored.\nStay in Pichilemu and enjoy Pichilemu and its great scenery. In the south east corner of Argentina, the South American coast touches the Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s a small town filled with shops, cafes, and some places to eat and drink. If you like to walk, head over to the old town and get a glimpse of the colonial culture, and if you like it more urban, head down to the port and see a bit of life there.

Mayne was a conservative judge who opposed women's rights ; Bedell won the election by a 14,150-vote margin and was sworn in on January 12, 1973. At the time of the election, Bedell was the assistant to a state senator, the first man to hold that post.\nBedell was one of seven Republican incumbents that died in the primary season of 1974. Although he had campaigned against his opponents, he would be replaced by Democrat Henry Norris ( a former governor of Iowa and a former Iowa Supreme Court Justice ), a candidate whom Bedell had supported. The success of Mayne was part of a Republican rebound as well as Bedell's own success. While Mayne was defeated in his first term by a Democrat, John Eberhard, he easily ran again in 1976. In his last term, Mayne would narrowly defeat Eberhard, who had been an aide to Governor James L. Dole.\nIn the 1980s Bedell worked for the Senate staff, but he was reelected two more times, in 1984 and 1988.\nBedell returned to private practice in Iowa in 1988 ( his wife was pregnant with their fourth child ) and opened, with his son, \"Bedell and Sons, P.C. \". It was the largest law-firm in Iowa with 75 attorneys. After several years in Iowa Bedell was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. He received 65.1% of the vote, a margin of two points over the Republican candidate. He represented a district that was centered on his hometown.","token_len":355,"entropy":[2.6862,5.7728,2.5207,0.1002,0.2216,10.9279,3.7408,2.9051,5.6196,0.4564,4.3233,0.4816,5.5217,0.0213,1.6539,2.8107,3.0819,0.1468,0.7389,2.5141,2.2132,11.8418,8.2031,4.6169,0.612,0.9022,2.6551,3.8925,2.0626,5.3812,2.7463,2.2441,0.0015,2.4029,0.0177,0.6288,3.0392,0.0003,1.7684,1.6226,4.2723,7.4878,1.105,3.069,6.2387,0.1522,1.6139,12.8246,1.9902,0.0066,5.1083,1.5231,1.4942,1.8293,1.4555,6.4056,4.4358,7.7721,0.369,0.13,0.0392,3.4895,2.4009,4.5833,0.1353,3.0011,2.6166,3.8441,0.1499,0.7798,0.2497,4.8645,0.54,0.4891,2.5174,1.2575,0.7717,0.0977,0.7314,0.0048,0.826,2.3744,9.2074,3.0623,3.762,2.6434,1.4064,1.6304,3.778,2.5231,4.8713,0.8624,1.9815,1.7074,3.0383,0.6598,1.5627,14.9689,0.0277,1.9248,3.8802,0.0186,4.6438,2.3019,2.8458,0.0002,4.7941,3.5134,0.3667,0.6279,3.4783,3.3971,1.6966,2.2397,0.5306,5.3579,1.4516,1.7257,5.0595,2.3263,3.9281,3.6459,0.9348,0.9977,4.8314,3.2627,4.6053,0.3222,5.2682,4.9783,8.1919,3.3427,10.5686,2.1735,3.8849,0.4667,2.2924,2.9599,1.3728,1.8396,4.1496,3.5069,0.0035,1.3756,2.1107,2.2742,4.3561,4.0688,0.6241,0.0052,1.462,3.2821,2.1488,2.7229,7.8388,0.046,4.5198,0.0006,3.1083,5.9565,0.0023,0.8435,5.9573,8.5809,4.8098,2.3793,0.9578,2.1374,0.0074,0.0756,3.3873,3.0853,1.4498,4.8536,2.6569,0.0007,1.4027,4.7351,1.0019,3.3208,2.1793,3.0693,2.9342,1.495,1.5455,0.5803,6.7483,4.4994,4.6474,2.4349,0.7595,1.6653,6.4092,5.5406,2.6631,1.1382,1.9963,1.1853,1.9555,2.434,3.6085,1.9454,0.4178,2.9567,0.0006,3.7965,5.6012,1.1268,3.8095,0.0032,0.0002,2.0968,1.8792,1.344,1.9453,3.6391,4.6474,0.0931,4.1401,4.9154,4.5946,0.2554,6.8665,0.4422,1.2453,1.1936,2.4348,2.4442,2.0401,0.2013,4.9639,0.0154,4.7338,1.5149,1.2354,4.782,5.5933,2.1114,3.6757,1.7413,1.6981,5.4887,0.5021,5.1179,1.9651,0.077,1.8514,1.623,2.5471,0.2994,1.5869,0.4099,2.4516,1.8519,0.0698,5.6321,0.1021,7.1438,0.4777,0.5798,5.4137,0.5719,2.3521,5.6243,4.5686,3.6055,2.377,4.3301,0.5789,0.5901,3.3171,0.0231,2.8626,0.4858,5.9039,8.1456,2.9881,1.7578,3.0885,0.6273,6.506,5.015,2.0786,3.5606,5.5904,3.7074,5.9005,0.3518,1.0807,2.0019,4.2668,4.4678,0.4512,2.978,3.6517,5.5132,8.2862,3.8285,0.2283,0.2283,1.7406,4.0146,6.6502,4.5185,1.5206,4.7884,5.0088,1.0175,1.4463,3.6139,11.3852,0.0102,2.4402,2.283,3.3951,1.0436,2.5335,1.3447,0.3736,3.5765,0.0403,0.287,2.8058,1.6572,4.2946,7.4998,2.0597,2.9886,0.3827,0.043,0.0341,0.1413,2.229,2.9204,2.9704,0.9774,5.8623,2.2111,0.9343,2.3423,1.7311,2.9615,1.4941,2.2972,5.3144,2.934,1.0494,1.711,1.3964,8.6016,1.0131,5.4909,5.2011,2.6737]}

The first about 6 @. @ 9 million years ago produced the northern and central hills while the younger and highly dissected volcanic edifice is in the southern part of the island. Geologic and volcanological data indicate that the central island may originally have been more or less continuous with the eastern side. The island has undergone many episodes of subsidence and uplift. Both phases were related to mantle upwelling and downwelling which continued through the period of the earliest sedimentation and in the last million years. The area of the island occupied by coral reefs during the Holocene and Holocene era is approximately 1,900 square kilometers (580 mi sq.). The reef covers a depth range from 2 to 40 meters with a maximum of 150 meters.\nIn the southeastern part of the reef, there is a zone with many large, deep reefs. There is also an area of shallow reefs extending from the south to the northern coast. Several prominent ridges and ridgely reefs extend in the north to the border area between Pohnpei and Kosrae. There are many shallow, wave-protected reefs just south of Pohnpei and from Kosrae to the Pohnpeian mainland. The easternmost reef of the island is the largest, with a maximum depth of 80 meters. Between it and the main islands in the group is a large island known as Pohnpei Rock that is isolated from the main island group by a 60 to 1,000 meter deep barrier reef. Several smaller islands are within the barrier reef and some of these have only minor reefing. There are four islands with high, steep sides and several others with more rounded slopes. The lowest elevation is about five meters above sea level.","token_len":357,"entropy":[10.0789,1.1319,8.8306,0.101,5.5091,3.1913,6.3793,6.4861,0.5491,0.8136,6.1283,1.9728,1.6531,2.5203,8.557,4.155,13.9265,5.8449,8.5398,6.8674,5.7304,0.3018,0.0742,3.3236,1.0845,6.313,3.324,2.8314,7.0697,6.4352,0.156,8.4919,4.0799,8.6694,12.1471,0.0166,3.7438,7.4528,3.694,3.262,4.4805,0.344,2.2488,0.8915,0.3766,0.1302,0.3093,0.4667,7.2529,1.5925,3.4646,6.2805,0.6256,2.3009,2.1935,0.4935,0.95,4.7348,4.7868,4.4755,8.5757,0.304,0.501,4.4157,2.9937,0.0014,5.702,1.3875,0.4043,3.2336,2.8502,1.6858,1.3488,3.3605,2.6876,4.6276,3.0544,6.9008,0.1021,6.7922,0.1516,1.4772,5.6921,0.0186,2.1726,6.1033,4.1905,3.2343,6.7169,0.418,8.6332,7.4559,0.1443,0.1225,1.455,6.7006,0.066,0.0179,5.0348,5.7773,2.8685,0.6352,4.3441,1.3217,1.6429,5.4695,6.3528,2.031,2.3084,5.2727,1.2453,3.4351,6.8201,0.0802,1.5931,1.2999,5.7508,1.2994,0.6478,1.6288,7.65,0.3584,8.5258,0.7017,3.8052,0.4448,5.9101,0.0004,2.8705,3.4323,0.0088,6.5263,1.3594,3.5398,2.6608,1.1749,3.7772,1.5691,0.8108,1.0847,6.3617,5.6983,7.5805,6.3021,1.1716,4.8166,5.3854,2.242,3.9363,3.8347,2.0686,2.9704,1.2207,4.1631,1.3639,3.7564,1.3785,2.324,2.1055,5.1772,0.4068,1.1721,3.7539,8.8872,1.0353,6.4161,0.8619,0.02,0.0634,6.6432,0.9512,3.3797,0.8584,0.8083,5.7075,3.7056,5.9627,3.1257,3.1392,3.898,2.9104,1.3497,3.3807,1.2714,1.8599,2.1279,0.724,0.9903,2.5881,1.5689,5.0494,1.1856,1.0676,3.2648,1.2353,0.2041,3.4699,3.0132,1.0749,5.4273,6.5819,5.8193,0.0154,2.2984,6.301,9.0964,3.2389,4.4958,4.0258,0.8841,3.2176,2.6866,0.3617,7.1914,5.7604,2.4574,6.7058,7.535,0.2423,0.6436,7.9033,6.7495,3.9776,1.2496,3.2432,0.5659,3.5281,3.6674,2.3732,8.2251,0.457,5.9749,1.7795,7.2708,2.3343,0.0766,2.4266,0.0062,0.0003,1.9342,4.903,3.0051,0.0031,0.0016,0.8127,1.0381,5.0765,0.1512,9.0699,5.4094,6.0395,0.3457,1.3201,4.2025,2.4256,1.8811,2.8052,0.1631,1.1416,0.6587,2.5081,3.8921,2.4946,1.4285,0.9084,3.6205,0.3982,0.2085,5.242,0.2633,0.6819,5.9294,5.0538,0.2163,0.4831,4.3102,4.3588,3.681,0.3438,6.7603,3.0571,0.7626,2.8441,4.6486,3.3396,0.0719,2.8185,0.4698,0.3804,7.9702,4.1283,1.1933,6.8791,0.5165,0.4602,2.2184,0.9242,4.3898,1.4778,1.2132,7.8918,4.5915,5.3998,3.5556,0.891,2.0413,4.6206,4.6523,3.1713,0.4941,5.323,3.2657,0.948,1.9207,4.0433,0.8678,1.5787,0.1009,2.0177,2.8389,1.5826,1.4113,2.7144,6.2519,3.2636,3.2535,3.1134,1.0526,3.4072,0.4278,5.0299,2.7366,2.884,4.9222,3.5418,4.7878,5.3904,1.5786,5.014,5.0695,0.5807,4.5742,5.5729,5.4158,0.403,1.0695,5.6074,4.5928,1.0496,1.7866,6.7337,0.4396,1.4816,0.4603,0.0059,0.5595]}

Behind the gatehouse is a low wall with a stone chimney in the corner; the wall is built in brick and in wood, with an interior opening. There is a porch or an extension behind the wall, with a large entrance with wood frames on three sides and two stone sides. The entrance to the porch overlooks the road, with two large windows.

If they get too much, it causes hardship and debt, and it creates problems for people who have been able to work for years straight, and have good reputations.","token_len":359,"entropy":[7.7998,6.0677,2.4071,5.524,0.2463,7.5623,1.5914,3.7402,0.8194,9.6318,0.1507,1.6061,1.6048,6.1545,2.1905,1.4515,1.4929,11.8303,11.2945,3.3731,0.5071,1.9021,8.8108,0.5994,10.0007,2.0257,1.588,5.0073,1.0464,7.3983,2.176,2.6306,0.1799,8.9814,4.9243,6.125,1.4615,3.0815,0.478,1.8221,3.3735,0.1901,4.7175,2.2921,2.399,0.1365,4.5018,6.408,2.1992,3.9537,4.1543,0.205,8.0188,16.0606,6.9156,8.2501,2.0144,1.837,4.5027,4.7796,0.4098,4.1297,5.1427,3.0288,5.2626,4.4209,0.1354,6.5193,2.1711,4.1021,1.8171,1.987,4.4666,4.5807,0.6941,0.9525,1.7748,4.2482,2.7617,1.2783,0.0013,0.1382,8.0016,1.9595,2.2042,2.1375,3.339,0.3099,4.825,1.3852,2.741,4.1551,7.7556,8.0234,6.5217,4.2552,7.5064,0.672,1.1184,0.444,5.1695,0.8817,1.2235,1.8349,5.0055,3.3546,4.6572,1.8659,6.3392,1.4699,0.8109,4.6065,2.1344,2.4093,1.5393,0.3067,6.1022,2.1478,0.9412,7.9061,6.7374,2.2849,3.9566,0.5662,4.9911,3.8705,0.5561,6.668,6.1244,3.5245,1.1801,7.0968,0.465,2.5323,2.5023,4.4738,2.016,4.2933,2.0631,6.8687,1.9363,6.9144,6.8568,0.7285,5.7321,4.1677,0.6675,4.8853,7.6827,5.6559,0.0521,0.0404,5.9469,7.3164,0.1112,3.5188,1.1103,2.0693,5.2263,3.2306,0.7602,7.309,1.3769,0.8362,9.8539,4.2136,6.2888,4.8009,0.0464,0.0964,5.3229,2.9814,5.353,4.5579,7.8121,2.9118,3.4067,4.9875,2.5089,7.2625,0.1258,3.4571,1.8373,4.958,1.4612,4.5673,1.4977,2.2666,0.5162,0.6422,4.7179,2.4233,6.004,0.0017,5.0303,6.7223,4.3958,2.7626,5.1225,1.8861,0.4253,1.8256,8.2825,5.4767,1.8884,4.2205,1.0702,3.2204,0.874,5.516,0.5833,3.7415,0.7495,5.7465,6.7027,3.0334,3.0265,2.4973,5.2197,4.0175,0.4513,2.489,1.119,3.8831,1.3763,4.2889,0.0032,0.0083,0.0303,3.2578,0.2703,1.2275,4.3297,6.1857,2.1288,4.0951,3.7068,0.1067,0.2221,0.0082,0.8489,1.1784,6.2578,0.2974,1.8708,2.0728,2.1898,5.4165,7.3529,0.4647,4.1536,0.0102,0.5612,6.4376,3.9649,4.0741,8.8815,0.4268,5.0136,4.1801,1.2253,0.7508,1.2025,0.004,5.4914,0.1458,1.1456,1.7495,4.2166,0.5012,0.6812,0.2358,0.9562,4.5193,3.3239,5.5463,2.336,2.8434,2.6418,4.9548,2.6256,6.0573,0.4347,12.8118,2.0822,4.1904,7.4209,6.529,4.7891,4.8689,1.5732,6.6914,1.2902,1.9967,3.6892,1.7046,7.388,0.7656,4.009,3.1509,3.0464,1.5922,0.8168,2.9309,5.7988,1.7956,4.8035,3.2552,0.6041,1.2753,4.7367,0.6888,0.0505,1.1875,2.115,7.0474,0.057,4.0501,1.9386,4.3212,1.6256,1.6108,2.0538,0.6897,3.339,3.0012,2.5795,5.6752,0.5696,0.6692,1.9884,5.4698,6.0696,1.514,5.9539,2.3128,0.9398,1.9539,3.4408,3.5831,0.8437,3.2245,1.6877,2.4589,1.6995,3.8197,0.007,2.8617,2.8807,1.6412,8.2941,2.4795,1.2776,4.1773,5.1488,6.3704,0.041,1.1165]}

McCarey was recalled by Wolverhampton Wanderers due to his injuries. Despite the win his future in the Magpies was now unclear and his contract expired at the end of the season.\n\n2009\u201310 season\n\nOn 13 January 2009, Jamie Maclaren and Josh McAnuff joined York on a season-long loan. York were promoted to the Football League from the Conference National following a last-minute draw against Wrexham. On 14 July, McCarey completed his comeback from a broken nose, suffering the injury during a January friendly. He made his Football League reappearance against Notts County that week.\nAt the end of the season, it was announced that the club would sign full--time player Paul Hislop on a permanent basis. Having been left-out of his previous contract, McCarey had no option but to resign and he moved on by mutual consent to Sunderland at the end of the 2009\u201310 season.\n\nNational honours\n\nOn 11 May 2009, McAnuff, McCarey, Patrik Hargreaves, Jamie Maclaren and Matt Elliott were named the 2009 British League First Division Young Player of the Season award winners.

Two days later, the Government of Mexico issued a state of emergency for several coastal and off-shore tourist sites along the Pacific coast of the Mexican mainland. On June 4, the president of Mexico made this declaration to close these sites and move the affected tourists to hotels. Heavy rains made the conditions dangerous, with coastal surfing restricted. The hurricane damaged several bridges and caused flooding in several areas which affected the traffic; a report said that the impact of the rain and heavy winds affected nearly 20, passengers at a port. Some areas of the Mexican mainland and the Baja California peninsula received precipitation totals of more than 70 mm in one hour; the largest, 80mm, was recorded in Los Cabos. Most inland parts received 15 mm or less, though much of the Baja received in excess of 30mm. The Santa Barbara Channel experienced a storm surge from the storm. It also flooded the ports La Paz and Loreto, and caused considerable damage to the La Paz International Airport. The hurricane damaged two large powerlines on the coastal part of the Baja coast, and some damage was also reported to a transmission line further offshore.\nOil spills. On June 6, a cargo sank off the coast of the Baja California Peninsula, after it failed to return to ports for refueling. The sanked in the Gulf of California. The sanked in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil spilled from the sanked caused the deaths of at least 13 sea turtles, along with multiple turtle hatchings. As of early, almost 20, metric tons (20, long tons; 22, short tons) of oil had collected on the sank's surface.","token_len":361,"entropy":[7.6025,3.3363,0.2511,16.2789,0.009,9.9737,0.3374,6.8133,5.643,0.7514,6.6224,7.1203,3.8084,0.2853,3.6082,2.6483,7.3317,0.0552,4.7071,3.1424,1.5691,6.1382,0.0783,4.7365,4.1284,1.2635,1.5936,4.5012,0.5928,5.8764,3.5617,0.2985,0.1955,1.7017,8.0005,0.2202,1.9213,0.839,0.7765,4.4774,0.2686,0.0265,1.9649,4.8466,3.9775,3.9869,6.9456,0.1278,0.951,6.6537,3.6469,4.1059,0.2123,4.5496,0.7269,1.3889,1.655,4.2552,4.0268,0.4861,3.407,0.8366,1.3049,0.0807,1.4385,7.0739,1.1162,1.8448,4.9161,5.0417,2.6199,3.4787,7.3832,6.4122,2.218,1.6858,5.3995,2.0571,4.1398,2.4577,0.9382,5.146,1.7257,10.0949,0.9729,5.2884,1.8726,5.6635,4.7287,1.8067,2.0402,5.5557,9.9459,7.2237,2.3795,2.4062,4.5437,5.5224,3.526,3.5645,1.075,3.4762,3.28,1.1882,2.0796,1.9305,7.5484,3.509,2.2115,7.6124,7.66,3.7703,4.7644,5.3368,1.4602,2.3339,5.5427,1.2193,0.4204,4.6727,3.2051,2.7709,2.1956,5.4525,4.0611,3.751,0.4917,19.4477,3.8196,2.6231,4.8304,4.8819,4.5468,5.5184,1.503,0.6454,4.3129,1.4088,4.4067,1.9166,4.3978,0.0012,0.234,1.5982,4.612,8.9554,5.3739,0.7796,2.6854,0.018,3.5775,1.7016,3.2561,4.9541,1.7271,3.8926,2.0112,5.9235,5.4889,7.365,5.8934,0.2622,1.063,2.3303,1.3422,5.3218,3.3224,0.0996,1.7631,5.8243,4.9087,4.3181,5.6393,6.3038,0.8634,1.6789,1.1867,1.9042,4.7731,5.3354,0.1736,0.4247,3.6146,0.0049,10.2898,5.9257,1.5196,0.0645,2.2228,3.596,0.4185,1.7683,7.6971,2.2975,4.9605,3.5325,2.4681,5.0724,0.1577,4.4051,1.4929,2.3143,2.6015,4.0993,3.0518,4.6653,2.0849,6.7845,11.3589,1.9985,0.2336,0.6597,9.6561,0.4894,1.7153,2.3187,3.2101,5.412,0.6368,0.4146,1.4084,6.2985,0.6359,0.0093,3.9044,0.0639,0.7823,1.6727,3.6811,3.7164,3.2118,4.122,3.8988,4.9934,3.7845,0.3784,4.6806,4.5937,0.0218,0.4708,2.4004,0.0016,5.3754,1.0101,2.0004,4.0205,6.7594,1.1215,2.4477,1.8353,1.6908,3.1819,5.9741,0.819,9.1461,4.7089,0.5065,2.2209,11.8145,4.7372,5.0274,2.2921,0.4274,2.3888,0.0807,2.3332,5.8481,10.6729,1.1543,0.4817,0.2933,0.0295,2.2155,2.3315,0.0057,0.174,2.0377,1.5025,4.2592,2.3322,5.19,0.0681,3.4437,0.446,4.8556,3.7794,3.3168,0.0209,0.5988,1.506,9.3176,13.5524,7.5646,1.9317,3.531,0.3214,2.505,5.3524,1.6723,4.2896,3.0037,1.9101,0.1403,0.2314,0.057,2.9027,0.6612,3.8703,3.5197,1.0298,1.2075,4.7547,2.3473,10.6052,2.7002,6.3255,0.0587,2.8046,0.0002,4.225,7.0733,1.0318,1.3168,4.4525,0.0311,6.8318,5.6542,5.3949,6.6358,0.8371,5.0778,1.4311,4.2953,7.839,8.341,4.256,1.2835,16.1852,0.0353,3.1112,4.3067,0.3654,13.0224,0.9994,6.5205,5.4977,0.624,3.9076,0.0953,0.2994,0.2331,0.8348,1.7229,8.6501,1.9683,0.6031,11.5925,7.8069,2.1564,0.7261]}

The mines took on a heavy toll within a month in that a great many mines and underwater explosions were caused before the Japanese Navy could be removed from the area. By the beginning of 1943 the minefield had become an international concern in that the Allies were making efforts to develop defensive minefields for the seas around the Baltic.\nIn May 1943, the United States Navy ordered the RCS Admiral Graf Spee to have the mines washed away using high explosives. The minefield was dismantled by the end of 1944 with the assistance of the United Kingdom. An effort was made to re-lay these mines, but it did not proceed at a speed that the Admiralty hoped for due to the difficulty of navigating the mines. By May 1945, Allied minesweepers had removed the last of the anti-submarine mines from the eastern part of the Black Sea. The mines were eventually disposed of between 1946 and 1948 by the USSR. \nSince 2006, a memorial plaque has been placed by the Admiralty of the Russian Federation on the former base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

She had a kidney infection that was put down to her having sex with someone, a friend of someone, in New York.\nYoko, then 33, was married to Pete Townshend before having a relationship with John the following year.\nI don't think it's fair to say Lennon did not want a family.\nHe and Ono, who was married, had had a baby in 1966 and were expecting a second.\nYoko was a great mother and wife, and John certainly didn't want to undo that by having another baby.\nSome fans and Lennon's wife Cynthia would even have preferred Julian to be made a minor.","token_len":362,"entropy":[12.8633,2.1945,9.3099,0.5604,2.2936,4.4515,1.9283,4.6459,4.3443,3.9219,3.0871,2.7543,8.0639,5.6366,4.5942,6.7557,0.0974,0.0004,3.2463,1.5134,7.5457,0.1804,2.7158,1.294,1.1071,2.0403,3.0085,0.4916,0.7628,3.5814,1.2411,3.7189,4.7705,0.5095,0.6324,3.2327,4.1193,6.1996,7.8186,0.7528,7.2203,4.8766,8.4567,3.4203,2.6957,1.787,1.412,1.5913,4.3532,2.9892,4.1534,4.1906,0.9472,1.2161,13.5962,4.4121,0.5929,0.1004,0.0007,5.6775,10.838,5.0162,4.2543,0.7701,11.5674,0.0037,0.0005,2.3816,5.2631,5.2856,2.5562,3.401,1.1193,5.1366,0.2652,0.6488,3.2738,1.7625,6.6475,4.0266,1.9494,7.9609,0.56,1.2184,2.6089,2.3021,0.0176,2.2035,1.6669,0.9333,3.1675,3.5697,5.1625,1.0759,4.5533,5.5281,1.1724,3.4366,1.9177,1.657,4.6401,1.5607,3.0052,0.1198,5.1416,4.8504,3.6756,3.1572,7.1088,1.3898,1.0774,0.4428,0.3315,0.9234,1.8157,3.2185,0.3722,1.1951,3.0569,2.2345,2.764,2.3476,1.1521,0.6391,1.1961,0.478,0.3836,1.8552,2.0701,4.4316,1.5333,6.0808,0.3402,1.661,1.3728,4.2775,1.9911,1.1734,2.3439,3.1054,4.0246,4.9628,3.2078,4.9341,0.4736,0.6516,3.0938,0.4642,1.9226,0.6642,0.4899,4.7863,3.6718,4.0084,3.7861,5.2211,2.0671,0.1435,10.6829,1.2904,5.4078,0.2871,3.0857,6.2856,9.2643,0.2297,1.3504,0.6881,6.141,2.1737,1.8044,2.4715,1.0818,0.2886,0.0016,1.8426,3.66,6.9032,5.1137,2.3447,4.7451,5.0799,4.1763,0.9634,4.4554,4.9257,0.7783,0.9194,0.8524,4.0719,3.8402,6.3993,0.1149,4.8396,2.8392,0.9611,3.1244,1.1995,6.769,0.9624,1.2778,1.3361,0.1836,1.2737,5.6574,0.5996,0.9144,3.9314,7.7961,3.4526,2.4931,4.8225,0.0038,2.0329,5.9081,4.1433,1.3147,0.3399,2.5274,4.3314,0.4255,2.5859,2.5867,4.8954,1.4825,5.8189,3.3994,1.8046,2.4821,0.4682,2.1903,2.5743,2.4197,6.3378,2.2458,2.8,2.4637,5.296,2.9416,0.6251,3.2999,4.4264,4.4186,0.1573,4.4116,3.2522,4.0726,3.3807,1.9126,8.3035,3.31,4.4291,3.5721,0.0755,0.7243,0.5746,2.8783,0.0237,3.1604,3.6725,4.6971,0.2382,1.294,5.008,0.6101,8.4683,8.2017,0.0115,0.0001,5.7728,3.8804,1.5998,5.4324,0.0302,2.3107,6.2183,3.3234,0.3633,0.2795,0.7996,5.8899,3.7218,0.0007,1.5221,2.2838,0.8823,1.6018,0.5313,1.2043,3.7497,4.8983,0.98,3.3038,2.7493,3.3724,1.2885,1.5772,3.3804,3.9849,1.045,0.002,3.4003,1.1487,2.7309,2.5798,3.3723,1.2862,4.8744,1.2415,2.1361,2.0625,5.0037,2.073,2.1029,1.664,1.5608,2.9031,2.304,0.7282,2.9626,0.0125,1.6392,3.1284,4.7279,3.0885,1.4735,4.6529,1.1949,1.1603,2.7277,7.9536,2.8463,0.0004,0.6364,1.2698,9.9797,2.0508,4.2014,1.3344,3.3555,1.7576,0.3804,0.4101,6.0561,5.149,3.872,7.1145,1.0817,4.457,9.0191,4.5417,3.4799,2.9948,5.0934,6.4433,0.7792,1.5516,7.8001,1.6268,7.781,1.9092]}

The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor by King Henry III to enable him to hold a market on Saturdays.The town was the first town in the north east of England where cattle were slaughtered for the use of the local market and for the export to the French market. The main street, Lathom Street is named for Matthew Lathom.\nAn old clock tower is still standing on The Corner of Lathom Street and Great St Peter's Church (St Peter and St Paul).\nIn 1701 the town was granted royal freedom and it became a borough in 1713 with a Mayor and twelve burgesses, in 1720 the borough was granted corporation charter and a chamber of account was created. A large part of the medieval castle is now the council offices complex.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century the town experienced a boom in economic activity with the establishment of the British Steel works and the railway construction. The works included a large steel works, rolling mill to produce the steel sheet for the new railway lines across the Northumbrian coalfield, the collier and coal mining for the steel works.\nIn the late 20th century the town has enjoyed a revival in the retail trade. There is a shopping centre on Great St. Peter's close opposite the medieval St Peter's Church, that has a huge variety of shops and is on the other side of Lathom St.\nThe railway from London King's Cross to Preston was opened in 1841.

All three episodes were given away free with a copy of the Daily Mail Sunday supplement between 19 January 2008 and 14 February 2008 to celebrate the publication of the novel. They were also released separately on 28 January 2008 on DVD in the US and Canada on 2 February. The DVD and Blu-ray of the adaptation also contained interviews with Daniel Day - Lewis and James McAvoy, as well as deleted scenes and bonus features.\nIn the UK, the adaptation also had a special edition of six theatrical features made available by the BBC Home Media Group; these came with a specially produced poster designed by Christopher Lee (based on a watercolour by Laurence Sterne himself), a DVD of special features and a booklet featuring a short interview with Jonathan Pryce.\n\nSynopsis\n\n\"Mr. Darcy is known the world over for his virtuous ways, and it is not his fault the gossip of Tustenbridge has always kept pace with him. Darcy never gets a chance to talk about himself with either Emma or Elizabeth, and neither of them seem to get very much of a chance to talk about themselves, since Darcy remains too occupied to attend their gatherings.\n\nAt length he begins to find it harder and harder to hide his feelings, and finds himself torn between his duty to Jane and the reality of his feelings for her. Then a shocking event comes to pass, not only for her, but for him too; Darcy meets Elizabeth in a different world \u2013 one where she is no more Jane Bennet of Tustenbridge, although she does feel she is her sister instead. Can Darcy persuade her that he is in love with her, and still be true to her?\"","token_len":363,"entropy":[3.4989,6.9162,3.0185,7.1691,3.2997,1.8796,4.9256,5.7194,15.4741,6.8505,5.6918,8.4322,7.3628,2.1608,2.9436,2.2859,1.8369,4.5757,3.9173,4.4638,0.6316,5.8203,4.1114,3.4447,1.1039,5.561,3.252,3.3347,4.4382,1.6901,4.624,0.5712,0.9868,9.8314,1.8046,7.4759,7.7591,7.7726,6.0073,1.4411,0.8897,0.1287,3.6943,1.022,0.6797,5.0778,4.7218,0.6715,3.4214,0.0814,0.9856,5.6065,0.9128,5.4293,0.8444,1.8228,2.3507,5.0011,1.0026,5.6177,0.9254,0.4073,2.8235,3.3396,2.2819,0.3489,1.6317,1.3704,5.5253,3.6301,3.5506,0.9557,3.1491,1.8888,3.7238,3.2753,1.0872,0.0124,0.1995,4.4723,1.15,6.4912,4.1426,3.4603,4.989,0.132,6.6675,4.3502,10.0128,7.9842,2.5183,7.1656,4.6292,0.0536,0.0014,1.665,3.3906,0.0107,0.0038,8.6609,0.0579,2.074,5.6661,2.814,0.6991,1.158,7.3722,1.8188,1.7075,0.5833,1.383,4.2407,3.1184,2.8529,1.1786,2.7608,2.0995,1.8479,5.9278,6.6992,4.0396,5.4832,0.8568,3.7855,1.8398,1.9454,6.317,3.2638,2.8227,5.6881,4.5327,6.2625,1.5381,1.3797,5.8509,4.5275,3.8104,6.1321,0.1482,5.7211,4.1173,3.005,6.6719,0.0712,2.278,9.3975,0.2751,2.1754,7.3393,0.02,3.0608,0.3903,7.9571,1.8464,2.0216,3.8225,1.7347,6.4769,1.2886,2.117,1.1872,2.8552,3.1801,2.3301,3.1194,3.6483,0.1557,6.0946,5.0155,0.3825,1.5416,1.1028,7.4614,6.3967,0.8859,0.0004,4.0597,6.7733,1.7138,5.1047,0.3069,2.3338,6.7148,6.6699,0.3041,0.0041,0.8576,0.2947,9.9789,3.4866,1.2061,2.2228,3.7971,1.3042,2.7732,3.8876,2.336,4.1543,9.6974,2.7428,8.7764,7.0927,5.9032,8.0933,2.2221,4.6166,4.1514,7.0387,0.0699,2.4341,0.4289,5.5644,0.0007,5.7369,4.3316,3.254,1.6734,0.0514,3.4988,0.8738,3.1384,4.0837,6.1495,9.0507,0.3317,5.7453,0.8465,1.4469,4.5581,3.0998,0.1097,3.7226,0.5092,3.6961,4.2485,2.0022,1.9903,2.5915,1.1834,0.6872,1.9216,0.2956,1.8618,2.5331,5.0547,2.3133,0.0001,6.9154,5.1295,7.9631,2.549,5.8256,4.7232,5.4214,0.9597,3.2903,0.001,4.4802,7.0003,3.7359,3.0932,0.198,4.2567,3.8988,4.154,0.9691,0.0351,0.0579,4.2016,0.6832,3.7267,1.9445,0.8376,4.9381,0.9837,5.9714,0.2506,1.4714,4.6216,0.965,4.7364,0.4107,2.5284,6.9436,0.3045,1.0123,5.4062,0.5683,1.4651,0.6341,5.3264,3.7785,5.2465,3.4578,3.8091,1.3658,5.0894,0.931,7.139,0.7602,1.7242,4.472,0.6002,0.0521,0.3218,3.2901,1.8665,4.3624,2.2656,0.0002,5.6484,2.713,2.3398,1.6057,5.9241,2.6238,4.9252,2.0234,1.7846,2.8708,1.0022,3.1695,3.2917,7.8349,10.4646,0.4174,6.1108,1.8689,0.0338,0.0052,0.0229,1.2267,5.6596,1.3518,2.9949,4.9531,4.2296,1.05,4.5659,2.7221,6.2022,0.6895,7.0558,1.4805,0.0003,6.7692,2.1454,2.2912,1.3683,0.9639,3.9856,0.6877,0.2741,0.3409,1.426,1.5445,6.1326,1.6785,4.8982,0.1207,1.2774,5.2245]}

Along","text":"She is part of the adventure subgenre of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century, but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day. Along with adventure fiction, stories of pirates, detectives, and cowboys, the genre includes novels such as The Secret Agent by Dashiell Hammett and The Long Black Veil by Raymond Chandler. Its central characteristics are a setting in the present or in future times, action, a strong sense of suspense, and the use of multiple viewpoints. It is characterized by the novelist's attempt to simulate actual reality, using events and settings which are familiar to readers but which have taken place before the story begins. The central characters can be real people or imaginary people invented by the novel's author. The writer's purpose is to create the illusion of an adventure with an unfolding plot, an unfolding plot with an unexpected ending.\nThis article provides an overview of the genre, including the major subgenres, the historical background of the genre's emergence, and the influence on and reception of adventure fiction in the United States and elsewhere. Readers seeking biographies of the writers of the genres referred to in this article may consult biographies of Henry James, Edgar Allan Poe, and E. B. White, the pioneers of adventure fiction.\nThe present article is based in part on the first edition of my book, The Secret Agent: Adventures in the Flesh & Blood of a Novel.\nThe first two chapters of the book are a survey of the central characteristics of the genre and its major subgenres, and an examination of the historical context. The third chapter examines the reception of the genre, beginning with an historical overview of the reception of detective fiction. The final chapter addresses some questions on the reception, importance, and durability of the genre.","token_len":363,"entropy":[3.5381,6.1679,0.1383,1.1188,9.803,8.165,1.9474,1.5133,5.9645,3.705,4.0314,6.8176,1.3108,2.8788,0.2241,3.4672,0.0039,0.1746,1.5241,0.0064,0.1292,1.7607,2.8177,3.9688,5.5494,3.8071,1.5414,5.7168,0.1667,3.363,3.8772,2.8095,0.4927,0.0716,0.2637,7.0576,0.4628,9.4842,1.9252,0.4819,6.3011,2.0865,7.7222,0.8286,8.423,0.372,1.6856,8.6605,0.1371,2.2997,2.4252,1.9081,4.2474,3.763,2.1211,0.0014,1.8483,5.5999,5.5057,3.1564,10.9294,0.2621,0.0006,0.0003,0.0069,1.7582,1.2421,5.9315,5.3484,5.2981,0.2718,6.4106,0.6484,0.4382,5.6124,5.5396,7.6056,0.5405,3.5489,6.6533,3.5949,2.6975,4.9208,5.8041,3.594,4.0214,4.0204,0.7825,6.9079,1.5577,5.52,5.4418,1.868,0.0116,4.9178,0.2921,0.597,2.6512,3.9535,0.0105,5.4581,5.6184,1.2898,2.5749,0.8819,5.1425,0.0588,2.3035,9.387,0.438,5.2785,0.0817,6.8717,6.06,3.5877,1.6372,4.3565,6.3699,1.8002,4.4304,4.306,1.1325,3.9873,0.6256,1.8603,3.5609,0.8924,2.4457,6.3202,2.4254,3.3041,2.6714,3.4393,3.5465,0.3027,1.8464,5.7631,2.412,5.2273,0.4526,5.5369,0.9935,1.519,3.2056,1.8343,9.0697,0.4461,1.4408,4.4539,1.3055,1.2091,0.9941,1.6102,5.3735,2.1999,5.1847,0.4544,0.2077,2.4451,2.7551,2.3032,0.3881,3.4653,5.8758,3.9405,3.1396,7.3916,2.8431,1.5822,4.3466,4.9305,3.0904,2.3817,2.7393,4.7148,1.5965,1.3164,1.9584,7.7963,3.807,4.0285,1.5261,0.6619,0.1088,0.534,1.827,1.6445,4.1281,1.7514,3.2782,3.4406,0.918,0.0015,1.0123,2.3045,6.1892,3.799,1.6294,0.3393,0.1787,5.7941,4.8646,0.297,0.5283,0.9963,4.9281,3.2499,6.2096,6.4354,0.1223,2.5754,0.3333,1.6114,0.6875,2.5043,0.0243,2.1899,2.8638,0.1665,3.7305,6.2675,11.4167,1.5344,0.6148,1.5086,4.2526,1.3009,1.4889,3.8558,7.8698,0.036,1.4525,0.2778,0.1384,1.9154,2.7638,7.1482,0.0713,0.4417,6.6819,2.5053,1.2032,4.5319,0.2523,0.0023,0.047,1.2089,6.492,0.1908,3.5174,0.0347,0.3457,1.8353,3.5179,6.4282,0.0971,1.6363,0.2436,0.9165,0.9779,1.9704,7.35,3.611,1.408,3.093,4.3721,0.0176,0.1136,1.1848,4.5535,1.5515,0.0679,5.3166,1.6716,1.1258,0.9268,1.9088,0.1876,2.3426,3.7758,0.5302,0.7372,9.2008,5.6261,0.5641,0.5483,2.5555,4.3058,3.3816,2.2939,1.671,3.0909,3.8443,2.0511,0.7054,1.2269,1.1016,1.3424,3.5096,5.1045,0.1078,0.6284,6.8915,5.0823,0.1649,0.7412,0.7913,1.859,1.378,4.7168,0.8358,0.0134,0.0183,1.4981,1.7361,3.5643,2.0308,0.0152,0.6585,4.0843,3.4675,2.1182,1.1908,2.106,0.3792,2.58,0.4419,7.1074,0.288,1.0341,0.3833,3.1367,6.6783,0.1632,3.5232,6.0085,2.9616,0.459,0.4026,8.6864,0.183,7.8923,0.4748,1.7066,1.2496,2.1979,0.2284,4.0996,4.1823,4.8518,5.1275,0.4813,2.5671,4.623,5.847,0.8051,0.2397,8.2173,0.0053,0.7841,0.191,1.3935]}

McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock worked for the church in the south. Later they would join Woodstock Church, the campus ministry of the University.\nIn the early years of his job, Innis had an easy time working with the university. By the middle of his career, he moved to what Innis called \u201d the dark side of university history.\u201d In 1950, he published a book, The Universities, History and Criticism in which he attacked the British universities for their liberal curriculum and how this affected the moral and social values of future generations. He went so far as to say \u201d \u2026 I could not say in that day that I was concerned with the right of the individual to his own will, but it was with the right of the universities to the individual. \u201d\nAt least until the 1950s, Innis had always been in favor of liberal values. His writings began to change, however, in his late twenties. As pastor of Woodstock Church, Innis became convinced that college students could be better educated with a Christian curriculum. He felt that the government could not control how much education students received and his main point was that Christian principles were important for a liberal curriculum.\nIn his final writing, the main argument of his books about the university, Innis was in favor of a secular university. He felt, as much as he used to feel about the universities, that the university system was not responsible for the moral decline of society. He argued that society could not simply be improved by changing schools, colleges, universities, and that it was necessary for the government to take an active role in teaching ethics and government.","token_len":363,"entropy":[8.1794,9.4561,0.2524,13.0475,2.4599,5.5204,10.0438,1.0244,8.6858,0.3022,4.5041,11.3093,3.7968,2.598,2.2319,8.5445,1.5683,2.1519,7.3663,2.3872,0.8055,3.0712,2.0829,1.7145,0.7632,1.7911,10.528,1.5022,1.4074,5.3473,2.7049,4.3053,1.2945,11.1404,2.1944,6.3508,2.3364,1.0086,3.0108,3.5569,1.1437,6.1211,1.3196,5.5959,3.8609,1.4234,3.0408,5.5653,0.0034,3.9481,2.0533,2.8304,6.1488,5.4526,0.9672,0.6845,3.7053,3.1477,1.3276,4.5212,2.7738,2.2023,2.6537,0.4936,2.259,6.101,1.0876,1.516,0.0003,2.5752,3.7691,5.1187,1.2874,3.3102,1.2557,1.8835,4.01,1.7326,5.5657,0.9656,3.9971,0.0384,3.1983,1.8602,0.2903,0.4963,6.1219,0.6482,7.832,6.4351,0.0004,1.2331,12.2039,7.2533,3.5224,7.7444,1.4364,0.6657,5.8166,7.6767,1.1375,5.8688,1.7583,2.9329,7.1715,0.263,0.9849,5.0337,1.2103,0.782,2.0068,1.8003,7.321,2.3038,6.494,0.9609,8.1835,0.2797,3.5819,2.3651,0.0621,5.2145,0.8139,6.4338,3.6608,2.3034,1.4823,4.1553,4.5594,1.2249,5.5329,4.9857,4.3747,1.3823,5.8407,1.6462,2.6259,2.5474,0.2593,7.5445,0.6965,0.1601,2.0755,4.1987,3.0868,0.0054,0.0259,0.0372,1.955,3.2867,0.7398,9.0847,4.5477,5.0407,1.3896,4.4968,4.3396,3.8551,6.1999,1.2228,1.3629,1.8852,5.6324,1.5172,1.1358,5.4671,0.7831,1.5871,4.5115,0.3208,4.733,0.527,5.5095,1.3895,1.8796,3.469,0.7115,6.4549,1.1615,1.6787,0.2218,0.8594,5.3352,0.4376,5.0965,3.5586,2.9239,1.9523,0.4229,2.3112,4.54,4.4159,3.0316,1.3296,3.246,0.0702,0.4268,1.5625,0.0004,2.3455,5.2104,1.1001,3.946,3.193,0.0086,3.0307,3.4943,0.8003,3.4982,4.5544,5.7836,0.3903,3.6459,2.362,1.7196,0.3752,2.3886,3.8601,3.1954,1.9785,0.8766,4.3066,12.4155,0.7816,2.7093,0.0042,1.2005,0.6694,1.3761,0.0004,2.8387,4.4179,0.2357,7.291,2.3134,2.8997,1.666,3.6242,1.5389,4.3709,2.1538,4.9904,3.3458,0.9529,1.3435,4.6733,0.5311,1.869,5.5239,2.655,2.0849,4.3995,2.8754,2.6868,4.0453,1.3992,1.2969,1.973,4.9265,6.3144,4.2078,0.6669,0.3581,5.3747,5.1677,1.3588,2.9228,1.7104,3.274,3.8965,5.4744,0.3083,1.4139,1.141,2.7816,4.1621,6.4359,0.7009,4.111,7.6777,4.6281,3.025,1.2765,4.3454,5.028,0.9735,2.5438,3.3723,3.1432,0.0005,3.6562,4.7889,0.2771,0.0111,2.1029,3.2314,2.8715,1.039,1.2628,4.0599,5.0239,2.2756,4.8556,0.2396,2.1155,5.585,1.2023,4.3826,4.1372,1.2135,4.223,0.3476,0.1476,1.5807,2.2826,4.25,0.6423,2.536,4.8013,0.0713,1.0099,2.362,7.8782,0.4396,3.8954,0.5588,1.4738,2.8905,0.1381,4.8423,2.8258,1.2749,5.457,1.0702,5.2642,0.8146,5.2072,4.4521,1.5151,5.2467,0.9773,2.4299,0.9804,1.0455,5.9939,2.8853,1.1577,2.0543,1.3623,1.4807,2.2167,0.1247,2.9647,4.4395,0.2845,0.4439,0.1021,4.991,8.1224,1.0196,5.6812,1.7246]}

Instead, the flag is defined by the Coat of Arms Act which specifies two variants of the national flag : the national flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Nederlands Herkedeien flag) and the national flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Nederlands Krachtstafel flag).\nBoth flags are black, white and blue, with the flag of the Netherlands (Nederland flag) additionally having a yellow border. The blue represents the blue flag, the white represents the flag the Union of the Netherlands (United Kingdom flag), where the white flag once adorned the flagpole of the Stadhuis. The yellow represents its status as the flag of the kingdom.\nThe flag of the Netherlands was first introduced in the Amsterdam Charter of 1617, with the new banner containing nine vertical stripes \u2013 four white, two yellow and one blue, surrounded by a red border. The colour blue and black were to come later. The flag of the Netherlands was used in Amsterdam until the Amsterdam Charter was replaced in 1795.\nThe Netherlands flag was also introduced later, in 1813. The red centre was added by King William II to mark the founding of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as a result of the abdication. The Royal Netherlands flag was used until the Republic was declared in 1910 and remained as the flag of the Netherlands until the republic was restored in 1948.\nIn 1947, the flag of the Netherlands was altered, with the introduction of two stars in the upper-left corner. In 1966, the two stars were added to the lower-right corner and, since 1997, the two stars have been located in the left lower corner. There are no blue stripes in the lower-right corner. The colours are still the same.","token_len":364,"entropy":[9.5061,5.8639,1.6351,4.6609,0.0895,2.7407,4.9925,4.8011,1.1446,4.15,0.1273,1.222,3.9779,1.2043,4.9149,1.8038,0.9877,10.1918,0.0669,0.0116,3.7953,5.2529,4.7277,5.9731,8.0508,0.9004,0.3804,1.4155,0.1789,7.0716,1.5303,3.6564,0.3853,0.9201,0.5694,5.8084,0.055,2.6054,0.1263,2.0794,4.9276,1.7598,0.3861,7.4681,16.6341,4.9092,6.8964,7.5242,0.7427,0.1466,0.1835,0.7437,0.0166,0.0412,0.7728,3.2642,0.0019,2.008,0.6644,0.2398,1.6051,0.0759,0.0916,5.4109,4.0476,4.1836,7.171,2.1006,1.9605,0.2366,1.1756,10.8479,2.4413,1.0072,7.0003,1.8521,1.6869,0.4824,1.5408,1.6711,1.8641,1.1355,3.1485,0.7704,0.2623,0.2399,2.5328,0.6368,0.0083,3.8766,4.3553,0.0598,10.0909,3.2142,1.0612,3.826,3.9851,1.1633,1.0782,4.1171,6.4564,0.6222,6.3408,4.8373,2.0711,2.1999,1.4261,1.0839,0.0929,5.589,8.0186,5.3879,0.3226,0.8894,0.1976,0.8354,4.6129,0.5124,1.1798,0.9017,8.2929,0.773,3.6794,2.2452,9.3378,5.6913,0.3366,2.8057,2.6236,0.9755,0.3732,7.2134,2.1477,7.957,2.0324,2.5625,1.173,4.5621,4.5131,8.4636,5.2778,0.1553,1.2813,2.0105,0.2046,0.2678,6.3254,3.2097,0.8464,0.9972,2.0622,0.5418,0.1617,0.4624,2.6196,2.395,2.4476,0.4509,2.2248,7.628,5.4291,1.027,2.2176,4.7414,1.4193,3.9611,0.7133,5.8355,6.2672,6.6735,6.589,6.6686,0.86,6.5752,2.9931,3.1423,0.8451,1.1973,3.1078,0.3648,0.6682,2.28,2.7451,7.0914,0.0441,1.5945,2.2709,2.497,0.3999,1.1186,5.0022,4.8172,3.6503,4.6102,1.3268,5.2265,5.4931,3.3169,1.5989,1.5185,1.7765,0.8807,0.1384,0.2989,0.803,4.4375,1.6477,6.2866,3.2943,1.699,5.8713,0.9295,1.8314,4.953,1.586,1.7592,4.4921,1.4917,0.6666,0.9038,2.8071,2.1243,1.0818,3.1023,2.7719,5.4172,2.6779,1.2371,1.813,4.1068,1.5031,1.0243,3.8456,7.9018,2.6794,4.0246,4.3622,4.0835,3.6768,1.0528,2.5201,3.9995,0.426,5.4296,0.1499,0.3755,3.2897,0.1871,0.7572,0.0165,3.8498,1.4531,5.5364,0.0089,0.677,9.2471,0.2767,0.0053,3.9999,0.8944,4.2868,2.3905,2.5083,0.5818,3.2549,2.3348,1.4623,6.3653,2.9596,4.192,0.3786,6.1163,2.9464,4.5592,3.7622,0.8112,2.3095,0.1686,0.1733,0.4977,0.1798,1.1753,6.0282,0.4681,2.8983,0.3431,4.432,0.1381,0.4803,2.8278,5.2144,0.4483,0.4716,1.6693,0.3763,0.148,0.4763,0.3025,5.3896,3.2244,1.7025,0.4679,6.3808,0.0171,3.2841,5.9493,2.8105,0.8649,3.913,4.3572,0.6433,0.1899,1.2467,2.7567,4.6122,0.3691,0.462,4.2529,0.8611,0.4224,2.5518,0.5991,0.3875,2.8069,0.5234,0.5822,0.1868,2.6876,4.5373,4.6179,5.5425,0.0654,0.7683,1.8398,0.6783,0.7509,0.4834,7.9192,1.353,0.5616,3.6125,4.7683,1.169,0.7851,5.5357,1.0335,1.9082,6.4343,3.4065,1.4811,0.2933,2.3494,0.4799,0.3446,0.1303,0.909,1.6865,3.7599,1.9869,5.0611,2.8446,0.0328,2.1205]}

Trujillo, the former slave owner and soldier who gained popularity in the Spanish American colony, ruled from 1930 through 1961 toppled by the leftist uprising of Dominican. He was born in Santiago on February 5, 1813, and had a nickname.\nTrujillo\u2019s real name is Ram\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez Trujillo, though this was changed to \u201cRicardo\u201d when he became Roman Catholic and chose the name Ramon Espinal \u201cTrujillo\u201d with the initials of his first name spelled in Spanish. In spite of being born into slavery, in his youth Trujillo made a successful trade. He had a number of employees, owned several stores, and became a businessman who later developed many companies. While holding the title of vice president in Spain he helped the country to defend against the incursion of a French fleet in 1939.\nThe fact that Trujillo was born in Santiago, the capital of the Dominican republic, gave him a powerful position in the national arena. At the beginning of his life he was a slave in a hacienda in Santiago and this was the reason for his nickname. Although he worked in slavery, he later owned several slaves and this gave him the freedom he sought during the Spanish American Revolution. In his youth he became a soldier, trained in a military camp. As a soldier he also had a position as a captain. In the Spanish American War he earned several medals for his part in the struggle against Spain for independence, but although he worked hard he never married.","token_len":364,"entropy":[8.2301,0.5267,9.6721,0.4393,0.0006,1.1169,6.208,6.7946,0.1662,4.238,6.1443,0.8542,6.3173,7.3489,1.029,1.4904,1.1469,8.9883,0.0768,0.7231,1.6739,1.2673,4.6875,2.9015,2.3989,4.0439,0.1093,1.1656,2.7038,11.4385,0.6777,1.8172,5.3909,0.0246,6.6731,7.6564,1.4692,4.0482,3.639,2.0122,4.424,0.0737,1.9809,9.2398,2.8381,3.306,0.0028,0.0008,3.4105,3.3008,3.5188,6.4132,1.5518,1.7956,6.9274,1.9055,6.4317,4.2925,1.5424,0.571,6.0558,3.4594,5.5311,1.871,6.7945,2.0878,3.8005,4.2812,2.0056,14.895,4.2462,1.119,4.9106,8.2287,0.7909,7.6288,9.0788,1.5962,1.1793,4.6506,0.5834,4.2159,3.726,3.2865,3.2425,0.0912,2.9222,5.8516,1.1129,1.1273,4.8506,1.7658,8.0062,3.7268,1.5812,9.5233,0.0792,0.002,0.0009,13.5134,8.0581,4.3413,4.0663,0.1896,0.7671,6.8199,0.5626,3.1886,6.0033,0.0182,0.0257,4.1874,1.2142,0.0131,4.094,0.0142,0.0033,0.9333,6.0798,3.3777,3.0464,2.1178,0.7517,7.9585,6.9147,3.8875,7.6706,0.1279,3.2829,6.4271,4.3681,0.8076,1.8816,9.0952,0.89,2.5898,7.064,2.4348,0.8731,2.7318,4.1779,7.0844,3.5289,5.2882,0.3943,3.8703,0.3189,0.0183,0.0067,2.7506,0.947,5.1915,1.0623,6.2599,1.8789,1.5772,3.4919,1.404,8.1691,3.1292,1.0154,0.7828,3.2723,5.1169,0.0109,2.7944,3.2203,4.2793,3.7903,0.767,5.7598,2.7088,1.8712,1.0535,0.0033,0.0013,4.4869,1.4802,3.701,4.2017,4.6021,1.1381,4.0565,1.3585,3.6185,0.0043,6.6616,1.4066,7.7012,2.9749,3.0944,0.4394,0.297,3.6467,1.0352,5.442,3.9981,4.3894,5.0435,4.7704,3.9119,1.0027,5.2026,6.2913,1.7226,1.1934,0.6514,7.2099,0.4617,2.9575,4.9165,3.3709,4.812,3.065,2.7679,2.0377,6.3754,2.7286,1.32,8.6329,1.3187,0.1313,4.0712,3.7332,4.2733,2.5366,5.0607,0.5502,1.884,2.7293,6.4791,0.078,1.0627,0.0041,0.0016,1.3435,1.8811,0.6605,0.407,2.2085,2.9506,1.977,0.1973,0.727,0.4558,5.3163,0.3853,4.9795,0.6733,1.3024,4.7656,2.5495,0.7529,0.5646,4.1312,7.4535,0.5948,4.3428,0.4588,2.5573,0.0433,1.671,2.1534,1.0157,0.9323,1.885,4.0842,3.3599,2.2739,7.4052,1.2704,0.0269,1.6518,1.4364,2.5685,6.7798,1.5344,2.5804,5.2888,1.9258,0.4106,3.4902,1.0475,4.0835,0.7135,4.6495,1.9696,6.0216,1.0225,0.765,4.8493,6.0819,2.0066,4.1193,1.4659,6.3019,4.1162,0.1716,1.6504,6.6364,1.9933,2.8241,4.5855,1.7059,2.0463,2.7786,1.6852,0.505,2.5954,2.2757,2.3083,0.8017,2.6085,0.7656,5.3856,1.8946,4.5989,1.2754,3.4588,2.4189,3.5659,4.4339,4.3782,0.5313,3.1617,0.7284,3.2438,3.7294,1.1303,5.6923,1.4628,0.8758,4.643,2.7643,2.2766,1.8014,2.8288,0.4538,1.2172,1.2388,6.4447,4.0099,2.4249,2.1538,1.1146,5.8191,0.0906,0.6185,3.8928,0.7031,3.9115,5.4445,0.0951,2.4684,2.2291,6.9076,0.3919,6.0903,2.8441,1.3784,3.3487,6.2147,0.8301]}

The Lotus cars also performed particularly well out of turn one with both drivers finishing close to the top in that regard. Fernando Alonso suffered a crash at the start of the race and a series of engine failures, a penalty that saw him crash out of the race. Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was forced to retire in the eleventh place while the three Ferrari cars finished out of the points. Williams also finished on top of the Williams-Lotus Team with their two drivers finishing inside the top ten, as they did in Hockenheim.\nIn qualifying, the two Lotus cars finished close, with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen being the first driver to qualify and setting a time of 1:21. 042. He led the first two practice sessions and after his qualifying time was beaten on the final session by Ralf Schumacher, he was adjudged as fastest in the morning practice sessions and he secured pole position with an impressive 1:20. 708 that gave him a large lead over Michael Schumacher on the morning of the race. The two Ferrari cars were quickest in both sessions, but Fernando Alonso only managed to finish within a single second of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and set a time of 1:21. 069.

As per the deal, BabyFirst TV was to be shown in India on weekday afternoons with Sun TV, while Sun TV would show BabyFirst in the mornings at 5:00\u00a0a.m.\nIn November 2004, The Seven Network signed a distribution deal with the Indian network TV9, under which the company was to broadcast a new version of BabyFirst in their programming block of Kids TV, from 2004 to 2006.","token_len":366,"entropy":[8.4727,0.2102,10.5072,11.231,7.0709,7.8365,1.7821,4.3571,2.6018,8.9903,2.8359,2.2058,1.1113,2.3424,3.9351,1.7955,4.9594,3.5531,0.0388,5.2308,2.7398,5.5008,1.3783,0.0489,1.9068,6.0762,4.5443,6.186,8.1754,2.8734,7.1436,1.8986,0.8437,4.4084,7.489,5.8818,2.1135,4.1777,0.438,6.4281,5.4305,6.3814,2.614,0.5845,0.9659,11.629,3.0623,3.8894,0.1293,5.8884,5.5074,5.2747,5.1184,0.5755,4.541,0.2072,0.0299,2.0561,1.18,7.8031,0.0006,3.3901,3.8252,3.2863,0.0253,2.4977,0.1263,3.3439,6.2066,6.2863,3.5281,1.8758,4.1142,1.3591,0.6314,0.0127,0.3541,1.5978,1.599,1.7802,4.1659,1.5213,0.4854,5.8899,1.5754,5.7121,0.4172,2.8564,0.2953,3.0789,0.3088,4.2091,0.2845,3.7373,0.2387,1.3063,0.3868,4.4763,0.3696,3.7201,1.1488,1.6277,0.3309,10.5778,9.6114,3.3089,0.8545,0.0847,3.2193,0.0341,3.7894,0.5956,4.6063,0.2357,0.1932,0.9265,0.5032,8.6642,0.7964,4.4425,4.3197,3.0608,6.1976,1.938,4.4552,1.8895,4.2743,1.8091,1.986,2.1792,4.1811,0.5175,2.505,1.4581,2.0849,0.3577,1.2812,6.7725,7.1362,1.6294,0.0006,2.8057,0.1217,4.1442,6.3567,3.1177,2.2018,5.1277,0.4389,4.5087,3.5698,6.4079,6.5469,5.2851,2.2557,8.3863,7.837,3.3627,2.9622,6.1251,4.6085,3.1493,4.2555,0.9173,2.0378,0.0002,5.3007,4.6881,0.839,0.0073,0.7655,1.7606,4.6383,0.4462,0.0002,5.6891,1.7219,5.2433,1.4781,0.1539,1.3049,0.0527,0.0428,2.6087,8.2042,0.9503,6.5185,0.809,0.0375,2.0391,2.5598,1.1346,0.7084,4.9646,4.7861,2.0482,3.1508,4.5033,4.1466,1.6605,1.3202,0.0164,5.1932,0.5218,2.4014,4.165,7.5803,3.7312,1.9249,1.9366,5.9181,0.9856,4.4647,4.8785,3.4778,1.3819,0.2126,2.0262,1.6623,0.8798,19.0834,0.4502,0.9014,3.7187,4.5524,6.9328,0.0481,2.703,0.7024,1.9321,1.4181,1.6495,0.0772,1.1472,3.5446,1.7462,0.7115,3.3211,3.7432,0.5397,1.7556,2.0734,4.445,3.1968,1.6008,5.8457,2.5391,3.4177,1.6714,7.9947,0.001,2.0563,0.0522,2.3438,2.3902,0.824,4.1488,0.0678,4.1124,3.2409,0.01,4.5941,0.4808,3.9742,1.4676,7.0314,3.8103,2.1874,5.3553,1.5312,2.7502,3.4904,5.743,1.8696,1.1836,4.4219,0.3278,2.2203,4.2801,5.0945,0.7082,2.6374,0.5781,1.4827,0.0315,4.181,2.5899,0.9084,1.6214,6.1532,1.0861,2.5579,1.8247,6.6008,4.4528,0.0305,0.0001,3.7507,5.5793,0.3924,2.4256,2.4939,4.1746,0.2713,1.4668,4.8199,1.8798,0.0457,1.5553,1.8247,4.5216,3.371,3.588,1.0328,0.9102,13.531,1.9322,0.0113,0.0015,0.117,1.9329,1.854,2.7124,7.3042,0.0938,4.395,7.7077,0.3295,3.8956,0.5209,5.9854,1.0186,0.2337,2.8436,3.5302,3.7781,4.234,7.611,2.271,5.0898,0.1737,1.4246,3.6441,3.2617,0.2342,2.461,2.9986,2.7644,1.0757,0.0214,0.2241,0.0765,1.7692,4.8086,6.0076,5.9477,2.6261,8.6515,4.2441,2.3477,5.1763,5.9125,0.8033,1.5453,0.1964]}

The music video contains the performance featured in the music video.\nWho Really Cares video by Powderfinger. Watch the official video for Who Really Cares by Powderfinger performed live on Accross the Great Divide Tour.\nPublished in The New York Times, March 17, 2020, by Sheree Anderson, \"When you first learn that you are a victim of violence, you don't see a path to justice. You see just a lifetime of darkness.\"\nWhat I like about these videos is that they are real, authentic, and raw. They are authentic, not scripted. And some of the scenes are powerful and some are painful. But they are not sensationalizing the crime -- they are focusing on the victim.\nThe first video follows the victim as he visits the police station and tries explain to them what happened to him. He starts crying. He says how he felt so betrayed and abused and didn't think he could ever trust again; that he didn't think he could ever come back. That his fear is of hurting the girl again. He tells the police that he had wanted to give her the money, but he didn't want her to be hurt. He just hadn't thought about the consequences. Finally, he says, \"I just didn't know when to stop.\"\nThe second video follows the victim and shows how the two of them, on the day of the crime, are standing next to a car. On his arms is his watch. On his arm of the witness, a necklace. The girl starts touching the man's necklace. In the background, he shows the money, not in his hand but right next to it on the floor.","token_len":367,"entropy":[8.3735,3.8438,0.8674,10.1576,12.9553,6.7132,4.2729,0.342,6.7225,2.17,2.202,6.1313,1.9087,0.765,1.4706,1.4464,1.7982,12.9111,1.6125,5.9096,4.9739,13.8032,0.4534,7.5027,2.1129,1.4571,2.3009,4.5573,0.3379,1.5176,4.1877,0.0585,5.7362,2.0115,5.9746,7.3729,0.6293,0.6457,4.1026,0.0184,1.3396,1.8674,14.0598,0.6385,0.0302,0.0006,7.3134,3.8438,0.1528,0.0004,3.2167,7.0395,1.0164,7.5934,1.4476,2.0028,2.0266,0.0212,0.0022,0.0005,3.8495,0.0455,0.0009,8.0605,2.7873,1.5087,12.1462,7.0096,0.022,0.0207,0.003,2.4811,1.9245,1.1249,9.332,2.0215,3.0601,1.8588,0.1734,0.0675,1.583,3.2873,3.4452,0.0618,11.2213,2.3216,4.6649,8.8819,4.5703,6.3506,1.774,4.1874,5.3778,3.8987,6.1396,4.6761,2.7585,1.8867,1.6917,1.9012,4.7638,0.1763,4.3111,0.6448,1.0277,3.618,0.0024,4.5863,3.0484,7.4149,0.9653,2.7765,1.5062,1.0879,0.7537,5.242,1.6847,7.8291,0.212,5.587,1.9961,1.0374,5.2175,4.3459,4.1461,0.4084,5.2592,2.1129,0.2938,0.5192,0.5689,1.6119,4.79,1.8961,4.6045,1.193,0.8614,7.7603,0.3961,1.6111,1.2827,5.4924,1.767,4.2244,5.772,1.1915,3.3753,6.1756,0.3483,0.7632,3.7746,1.3922,6.9617,1.6971,3.9573,0.7558,5.1998,0.6338,1.7147,1.5815,0.7218,2.0434,6.432,4.4852,2.0764,3.5761,5.1627,0.9713,0.2842,7.3912,0.1815,0.7008,3.6597,1.2592,1.0165,2.1247,4.4302,2.7502,6.3685,1.2532,2.7266,1.5695,0.7814,5.9376,1.374,3.0609,0.2858,2.359,4.1963,10.3377,1.4146,0.3874,1.549,0.7634,1.4276,0.3645,0.3886,1.9611,5.1304,2.2718,1.8134,1.0192,2.2231,6.1721,1.1034,3.3337,4.782,7.1542,1.7359,3.4615,2.6819,5.7735,0.0006,4.4919,1.0182,0.9545,2.0006,5.1448,5.996,6.0263,1.8395,0.43,2.7019,0.0008,3.927,0.4787,0.487,1.3108,4.6653,0.8725,1.2465,4.3851,3.653,6.0468,3.3931,6.436,6.4863,3.016,5.1413,2.749,1.2181,1.6368,2.925,1.5887,1.6793,1.0336,0.5384,3.7709,5.7956,0.3585,4.6562,0.8367,3.1002,3.1632,2.1883,0.8917,1.4078,1.7532,0.0007,1.4299,1.5974,0.2463,2.637,2.8796,1.112,0.8099,4.8673,7.839,0.0012,1.816,1.5245,2.9607,1.9673,1.0324,6.4123,0.3651,0.3936,1.6162,1.1113,1.038,1.0548,3.6213,3.5528,0.0012,2.2913,5.017,1.6289,1.0654,1.1807,0.9041,1.4759,0.9101,0.0764,1.8006,0.4301,0.3698,2.6706,4.985,2.7966,2.6938,4.5922,2.2932,0.0074,4.9395,4.7894,0.9065,3.464,0.7044,0.2513,2.1786,0.1143,2.9251,6.5685,3.1381,0.0013,2.7874,3.0951,2.0959,4.9976,3.6493,6.1506,1.7943,2.472,6.955,0.9984,1.8053,0.3294,4.1566,8.2061,2.2385,6.589,1.0758,2.7434,6.3883,1.4182,2.1846,5.3803,5.5696,7.2481,1.023,5.0271,0.1826,5.258,0.6832,4.3162,0.658,2.0251,0.7789,3.0537,4.4449,1.2023,6.7691,2.4879,5.8915,4.1486,1.8356,1.8743,2.5334,6.675,1.346,0.0044,1.7134,4.9053,0.4352,3.3114,0.5796]}

The manga won the 4th place in the Kodansha Manga Award 2008. There is also a Japanese drama series of the novel adaptation.\nAs a boy who likes to be considered a girl, Mizuho Miyanokouji keeps trying to be a man, while trying to be accepted by the other boys. This is not very successful, but he continues and eventually develops what is said to be a \"male personality disorder\", which allows him to take on the role of a girl.

The player follows a new 11th @ - @ grade literature teacher at the school, John Rook, who is forced out of his classroom and into management as he deals with bullies and misconduct among students. The player will also get to experience events from the main story in all gameplay modes. The game features many gameplay modes through the campaign, such as the New Game + mode, where the player must complete the main story in 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the Time Attack mode, where the player has to complete a selected chapter in under a specific amount of time. The Campaign Director mode is a story driven arcade game mode, which pits the player against Rook and other characters from the game. Players can also participate in the Story Mode, where they can play a number of mini-games to collect Rook\u2019s autograph. After finishing the main story, players can also take part in the Challenge Mode, which pits the player against other players in online leaderboards.\nIn addition to the gameplay modes, the players also have the option to take part in various activities such as sports and learning. These activities are part of the game, and the player can participate through the in-game menu for the activities. There are several sports games available, such as basketball and baseball, as well as several activity games, such as learning how to draw a picture.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see that the game features such a strong Rook theme, considering that the character is not the game\u2019s major focus. The game also features a series of tutorials at the start of the game explaining some of the concepts that the game will use, and there are a few lessons that give insight into the relationship between Rook and the students.","token_len":368,"entropy":[6.8795,1.6122,2.5894,0.4195,1.3308,7.7924,6.3294,0.1594,2.2364,7.196,0.8599,4.2689,8.4164,3.7913,0.7218,1.7855,4.3543,7.395,0.9931,6.1593,9.9088,2.9109,15.9601,8.942,6.4816,6.7409,11.4529,0.4445,5.0657,1.358,0.9478,1.4293,6.568,4.9953,6.1948,1.5832,1.1102,1.5629,6.1516,5.2382,1.2219,0.7988,4.3394,2.4174,2.2858,10.4622,4.3857,2.2152,5.4206,0.0126,6.8083,1.7684,8.1623,6.4359,2.5391,0.4068,1.9634,3.3378,4.3025,3.0355,4.3579,0.7781,2.7783,6.729,2.1994,1.0795,5.916,2.2348,3.0723,6.3215,10.7166,0.7452,1.5239,2.0723,0.6559,2.9746,4.7909,4.1168,2.2565,5.8502,1.9796,5.5494,1.1271,2.7155,0.0011,2.4378,7.0914,2.4081,3.282,2.5638,0.8269,3.2384,1.49,0.168,2.2002,2.7387,2.2965,2.9569,0.285,3.0639,7.3303,2.6107,1.5557,2.3007,0.1307,1.6756,1.1863,0.924,6.2035,2.6415,0.601,0.6035,0.2502,0.5476,0.0647,3.1108,0.1344,2.7631,2.1568,7.9871,4.7235,1.3473,6.1271,2.2524,9.6295,0.8688,0.0313,0.0227,0.4225,1.6238,5.5902,6.4001,7.8666,1.6382,1.383,5.0462,2.8219,7.7098,1.3462,3.0231,1.9726,2.5508,4.9625,0.8129,0.2135,0.041,7.5544,0.0378,1.8525,2.3131,3.2608,1.98,0.4771,3.2086,1.1457,2.7783,1.9404,2.1607,3.2886,0.0627,1.7143,5.1288,0.7572,1.6839,1.3137,0.9872,1.7257,2.6191,2.6751,3.0513,0.0075,5.7543,0.3944,0.0623,2.6555,4.2732,6.4205,0.0234,14.8589,7.1899,1.2671,8.3832,2.2539,2.3609,5.0705,3.7198,0.7835,3.7069,0.1136,0.6698,1.7627,0.8662,2.9643,3.677,1.0022,0.0111,1.0571,5.2999,0.2748,0.4684,1.9927,2.7035,0.7252,0.088,0.027,2.1436,0.8007,1.6153,5.7081,6.1917,0.0659,0.8029,2.078,8.385,2.1526,0.3296,0.7116,4.2505,0.8163,0.3645,0.9057,6.6521,1.4389,1.0383,1.3237,1.0279,0.4255,4.2616,0.4097,0.0109,3.3878,3.4518,2.2218,0.0022,5.5008,2.3258,6.5501,2.2318,3.5377,0.4676,1.5105,4.6309,0.0032,0.3135,1.7435,2.1546,1.6611,2.2834,1.0556,0.9628,1.8764,5.1832,1.5226,6.475,0.1269,0.0463,3.3444,4.5791,1.8374,4.8788,0.6736,3.6668,0.3287,3.5588,4.7538,3.9865,1.0887,1.4193,1.2046,0.0016,3.0491,2.455,1.9661,0.5057,2.5505,0.0178,0.0034,5.1241,6.4705,1.7196,1.3959,0.297,0.0026,7.721,2.7243,0.0265,5.0342,2.644,3.0816,1.5935,1.6474,5.2487,15.9744,1.4723,0.0132,3.8173,0.3467,3.1687,0.8498,1.2094,1.2507,2.9732,4.6347,1.1448,4.0781,6.9561,0.0171,3.1661,1.0972,5.8442,0.963,1.4982,4.0959,2.6835,3.8664,3.1012,6.2769,6.6036,0.1509,0.1542,6.3275,3.0787,0.6667,1.7325,1.1234,1.9836,0.6967,1.2797,5.3373,0.0019,6.6533,5.8785,0.7807,2.8885,0.5123,0.454,0.2071,5.9791,4.3495,0.4404,0.0787,3.2295,2.8372,1.6604,1.4383,3.5031,2.8813,2.4843,1.9213,4.7682,0.5605,2.7745,1.8417,6.1981,1.3904,5.3735,3.808,0.3788,0.7308,7.7042,0.1236,0.9833,0.0044,0.1251,0.9591,3.1483,0.4743]}

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a complimentary review. He claimed that the episode `` effectively ramped up to the finale''. Fowler noted that he felt the episode could have been greatly improved by removing the show's ''unnecessary emphasis on being gay'', because he felt it was interfering with the action of the episode. Fowler also credited the guest stars for making the episode and for the addition of homosexual jokes.\nAccording to Jeff Jensen from The A.V. Club, ``Although much of the episode focused on the relationship breakdown between Mike and Joey, what really stood out for me [was] the show's ability to have one of the slickest storylines of the season. The way it handled everything, how it kept the characters in a story arc that really had its own momentum and direction, [was] a real departure from its usual formula''. Jensen thought the story arc surrounding Ross and Rachel as a couple was the most successful element of the episode, saying it had been done very well and helped the episode to flow well.\nThe episode received positive reviews in Canada. On IMDb, the episode was assigned an aggregate score of 78% with positive reviews. The episode was praised for Ross and Rachel's decision to get married and for the storylines involving Joey and Chandler. In addition, many critics noted that the finale was very compelling.

Clarke about the insurmountable","text":"Dennis Feldman had the idea for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable challenges of manned space flight, he wanted to create a film about space exploration through an extreme situation where humans are forced to relinquish their technological advances in order to survive. With an unnamed director and executive producer, he brought together a limited budget team to film the movie. The film's screenplay was written by Steven C. Miller, who also worked on Star Wars Episode I.\nThe film's cast included many of Smith's then-youth band The Four Seasons, most notably James Earl Jones as Space Captain William \"Bill\" C. Riker and Donald Sutherland as Commander Data. John Williams was hired to conduct the film's score. Many of the crew's costumes and props were designed by the set decorator Michael Chiklis, who later worked in Space Chasseurs, and the makeup artists were Bill Anderson and John E. Toney.\nSpecies premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on April 22, 1989. It opened wide on May 1, 1989, receiving mixed reviews, and grossed $55 million against a $30 million budget at the worldwide box office. The film spawned numerous sequels and spinoffs, such as Predator and Might & Magic II, and used the footage used in it in the 1997 sequel Star Trek Beyond. Additionally, the film inspired a feature adaptation, written by William Tannen and performed by Al Pacino called Blade Runner. For their work on the film, Smith and Chiklis were awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the Seattle International Film Festival.\nIn 2018, Screen Daily listed 10 of the best science fiction films of all time. The film was voted No. 6 on that list.","token_len":369,"entropy":[10.0946,10.5164,6.0745,3.3533,5.4331,1.4255,12.7557,3.6704,6.3057,1.0927,4.5807,1.8472,4.0384,0.7778,5.3517,2.9642,2.315,3.2167,1.7435,3.8537,2.6367,8.9532,3.7835,0.9506,7.0356,3.6969,4.6317,1.6069,2.0562,5.5479,1.8032,0.0853,0.0252,1.6747,1.3465,13.0074,0.1381,0.0065,3.0707,0.9743,7.076,0.5999,2.2245,0.4259,1.4148,3.7669,0.1609,2.7669,0.6975,1.6462,1.2403,3.6534,1.9479,5.6731,3.7471,7.4375,6.0865,3.5377,2.0775,1.5604,2.951,0.1478,7.5044,0.0005,0.6601,4.4521,4.6587,3.0435,0.2156,0.0443,2.1197,0.6767,4.7616,3.6993,7.6269,2.3484,2.5375,7.1141,0.0404,0.6132,1.6184,4.5002,3.1221,1.6355,7.4387,2.0196,7.1675,2.4674,4.8912,1.2234,3.3179,1.3981,2.0692,2.123,2.8175,3.9934,0.7956,1.1208,0.1601,3.7828,4.9475,0.2328,5.1049,0.6925,1.1037,2.0926,1.8435,0.142,3.4273,1.7495,4.1383,2.1439,3.4962,2.6798,8.6429,2.013,1.8424,4.636,1.0392,6.094,1.3247,9.5129,0.1464,7.9711,0.4723,9.0702,0.0701,8.9436,3.5984,6.7273,2.6315,0.6181,6.9506,0.3036,4.9787,2.873,0.0173,1.98,5.181,4.1509,4.8911,3.0418,4.185,0.1598,5.691,2.9037,6.9141,2.0966,2.6281,7.7013,1.5624,0.0507,5.1217,6.1337,0.3926,6.2008,3.6155,1.9016,5.0587,0.9226,8.7822,1.0335,1.9032,0.2936,5.5999,1.7159,6.7101,0.3218,0.2813,3.422,4.5021,3.9836,1.6244,1.4796,0.4065,3.078,0.2465,2.882,7.9043,5.9744,0.1995,4.4704,5.6357,3.0231,0.5821,1.1546,0.673,4.1492,1.8684,3.7452,6.5581,7.9227,8.3042,1.9496,2.01,2.7966,2.3607,5.8833,1.7045,1.9741,5.5074,6.3559,0.9217,3.4482,5.4159,0.8,5.4237,5.6016,0.2828,1.2243,7.323,2.194,7.2995,0.8704,0.4773,6.5312,1.5489,0.0911,0.0138,2.3857,2.5068,3.406,0.1156,2.2342,0.6659,1.8119,4.3049,5.8734,1.5992,2.4316,2.4232,0.3518,1.4801,0.8513,5.4276,4.2204,0.1871,2.132,2.0875,3.6838,0.127,0.5309,5.3866,0.8847,7.579,1.0152,1.0479,3.7762,0.1888,0.7571,5.2971,0.1535,3.5503,0.0175,0.0047,0.1187,1.4417,0.4763,5.4187,2.9997,0.2734,1.1944,2.3108,0.4392,0.7473,3.2197,0.0005,5.5797,2.04,11.2499,1.7247,0.0668,2.6563,1.1641,1.5187,8.1974,1.275,7.3052,5.1981,0.5595,4.8557,2.2601,2.028,6.0919,3.151,4.2717,0.9882,2.1517,0.5194,6.5174,0.0075,1.2291,0.7406,5.3034,1.3556,4.11,6.5245,2.9875,6.6535,0.3834,4.5648,5.1237,6.7985,0.0458,4.422,6.7498,0.102,6.4006,2.0823,0.0005,8.1145,6.5587,0.2342,0.8835,6.2087,5.5718,4.2223,0.3745,0.803,0.578,0.1185,3.0095,0.9685,4.0336,0.016,0.0004,2.5522,2.859,0.5792,5.9369,0.6692,0.2074,1.3991,0.2398,5.9352,0.6627,0.0221,0.0113,1.0809,0.5898,2.3914,6.6747,0.1135,8.6901,6.6928,6.1836,8.4473,1.7785,0.2647,1.7252,2.633,0.1806,0.6344,0.3521,1.6709,0.0269,0.8917,2.0926,3.2604,1.6458,5.9181,4.8941,0.0035,4.443,0.7667,4.3639,0.2899,1.4832]}

Wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six `` fairly polished prototypes '' of which only three had achieved a sufficient degree of development to make a living for anyone with ambitions to ride one. Those prototypes were not all abandoned - for example, the Tango was revived as the Tango 2 and the Tango 3 continued to see service on a modified chassis as the Tango 5 in a more limited role. The Tango 2 and the Tango 3 both had a two wheeled version, the Tango Twin, but neither of those versions got off the drawing board.\nSolipskier was sold to the Belgian Air Force in 1951 but for the first six years of its existence it saw relatively few flights even though it never ran out of aircraft. The first was sold in October 1950 to Mr, H. B. de Beul, a Belgian officer who was not only on the air staff of the French Air Force but was also a friend of Captain Dronne, who built the first Solipskier. Mr de Beul had bought the aircraft on behalf of the Belgian Aviation Command. By 1953 the Solipskier of the Air Force was a fully equipped commercial unit, having fitted the passenger cabin and kitchen, a lounge for the pilot, seat heating and air conditioning and a set of two seats in the rear cockpit. During its brief spell in the Belgian Air Force the model was used extensively for instruction purposes by the pilots. It went on to be registered in France in 1954 under the number AF-PSO and served both with the military and commercial air operations of this single flying boat company.

In smokers who work with asbestos ,","text":"Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the incidence of lung cancer is higher than that in non-smoking workers. Asbestos is also the cause of pleural mesothelioma, also known as Mesothelioma.\n1) Mesothelioma is malignant and has a high degree of invasiveness and a poor response to chemotherapy. The prognosis is poor, generally with a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. 2) The early symptoms are very rare, and they are often misdiagnosed as other diseases, so it is important to get to the bottom of the cause, so that early diagnosis can ensure better survival and treatment. 3) Although many lung cancers, including mesothelioma, can be cured, many are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Treatment usually includes chemotherapy, but the drug and its effects on the body are often too toxic to allow chemotherapy to be the only therapy.\n1) If you smoke, try to quit smoking as soon as possible, or reduce the amount of smoking to a minimum. 2) Avoid exposure to asbestos, when you are exposed to asbestos, it can affect body organs such as lungs, blood, stomach and skin, the accumulation of asbestos increases the cancer risk of all organs. 3) If you find abnormalities in your chest wall and abdominal wall, you should seek professional assistance. 4) If diagnosed with lung asbestosis, it is not necessarily due to asbestos. Although some lung diseases can show asbestosis, asbestosis is not an actual disease of asbestos. 5) If the body feels weak and breathlessness, or if chest x-ray reveals a shadow, consult a doctor.","token_len":369,"entropy":[12.7307,5.428,2.1572,2.8164,2.2891,0.0007,5.5737,1.8095,0.8476,0.3524,1.1563,0.1873,2.3259,8.2711,3.2508,2.297,1.422,4.2914,4.3142,6.314,0.009,0.1891,0.5221,1.7642,4.2758,0.0762,1.6495,0.6299,1.0395,3.0558,5.6685,2.2662,6.7512,1.2827,0.4153,0.7704,1.7305,6.3559,0.1259,0.1636,0.094,1.5987,2.5109,0.7962,1.6023,2.5967,1.2564,0.3183,1.236,0.8912,0.3689,4.456,0.122,1.935,2.2093,4.5564,2.3424,0.0423,8.561,0.5514,8.0471,0.1329,0.0078,0.012,0.2975,0.4999,4.8681,0.1945,0.0095,8.1252,0.037,0.0248,0.127,0.0392,2.2394,1.4101,11.6735,3.8129,6.1438,0.0214,0.0105,0.083,0.0238,1.3103,8.4522,0.0695,3.6921,3.5921,1.0857,2.8226,4.658,0.0019,7.9346,0.1426,0.0022,2.0085,3.6174,5.3357,4.0759,0.3207,1.515,0.3715,2.2095,5.2625,0.0071,1.0123,1.0854,1.673,7.1399,3.0745,2.156,5.7679,0.7912,1.7208,0.5833,0.6713,0.6297,3.4645,2.8759,1.3948,4.3061,0.0119,1.8765,5.8509,3.4315,2.1729,3.3102,3.8703,1.3364,1.6298,4.0347,1.2188,2.4271,6.317,0.0584,0.0118,0.9514,4.664,2.7598,2.0607,4.5482,1.89,0.3191,1.4293,0.2828,3.3533,5.3157,1.6835,2.3892,0.0156,1.3886,2.2366,3.885,3.5034,0.7775,7.4543,1.4141,1.2391,6.3763,3.9092,2.4692,2.8091,2.9522,0.5189,1.0391,0.0054,4.8482,3.9399,3.8219,1.0216,3.9661,1.0326,0.1922,0.0049,0.0054,0.0127,0.0972,0.1524,2.6115,0.2401,2.5185,1.3295,2.6057,3.1016,6.5036,3.381,2.378,5.4764,0.0317,1.6125,6.2359,3.9441,2.6109,2.432,0.8299,3.3203,2.7779,6.8282,5.135,2.1871,4.2571,2.7814,0.557,2.5195,1.2312,3.1056,4.0152,5.195,0.655,4.4707,5.6087,0.9683,1.089,5.6882,2.0368,4.591,0.6256,1.4814,3.5341,0.4096,5.0798,0.7233,3.3279,1.0751,4.2092,0.692,2.9039,1.6104,2.7198,0.2255,0.0048,0.1619,2.2074,3.46,5.2664,1.7911,0.6213,0.3548,2.8598,3.247,1.8605,2.584,0.6253,2.1971,0.0087,3.2738,4.2303,0.0256,0.9536,1.7427,6.6344,2.3923,1.7495,1.9836,0.5707,0.9278,1.537,3.6001,0.7268,3.7674,7.57,4.8188,2.2023,0.014,2.4794,0.9422,2.8573,3.2257,6.515,1.1175,4.2108,2.0869,4.5253,9.8154,0.0371,4.7519,8.3517,2.3563,5.2038,0.579,2.5764,5.1758,3.3525,1.3067,0.7894,0.0066,2.4372,0.1569,4.8395,11.5797,0.5747,0.7315,5.823,3.706,2.9418,5.4407,1.8515,0.4655,2.1188,1.1892,1.6723,4.1069,5.6914,1.0529,1.6144,0.0077,1.7833,8.7499,1.4433,2.123,9.9199,6.932,0.0057,0.3603,2.2185,0.7378,3.4504,5.5279,3.6887,0.0075,0.9073,1.4558,5.1301,3.4494,2.4962,3.0446,1.5027,6.7413,5.2042,0.8667,0.0388,0.5518,4.8992,0.3889,0.0316,0.8427,1.8519,3.2977,3.5841,1.5601,4.2671,1.56,0.5716,2.3205,0.0087,1.7606,3.5346,4.1192,7.6001,4.2686,2.0972,9.4948,2.6956,0.9572,3.8894,0.5969,6.9471,8.9356,0.0512,1.8729,2.8076,1.9006,11.0702,1.2844,5.7671,0.9835,1.3523,0.5791]}

Stead placed Miranda 's home in the Upper West Side , New York","text":"When You Reach Me takes place during the 1978 @ - @ 1979 school year of Miranda, the main character. Stead placed Miranda's home in the Upper West Side, New York, and her parents, both professors at New York University's Balthazar Gray School of Music, in Greenwich Village.\nWhile Miranda has gone on to further study and graduate from the Balthazar Gray School of Music, it does not take long for her to begin experiencing problems with her family, notably her father. At home, her father often acts cold and distant towards her, and once, upon returning home, he abruptly leaves Miranda. She has been forced to move out of the house after a few weeks. When, despite being friends with her mother, she has to face her mother's divorce from her father, Miranda finds that living alone in a apartment has made her feel more alone and unaccepted. She eventually gets a letter from the assistant dean for admissions at a prestigious Brooklyn conservatory, telling her that she has been accepted.\nAs the characters take place in New York City, they are likely to include some references to the culture, art, fashion, social status, and lifestyle of New York at that time. In particular, an article appeared in New York magazine written by E. M. Forster, titled The American Dream.\nA number of other references can be found, such as the musical'' Dreamgirls'' featuring songs by Erykah Badu, and the television show,'' The Jeffersons''. In particular, one of the main characters, Mr. Wilkens, has appeared in both of those shows.\nAs with all of Stead's novels, A Song for Lulu is primarily about friendship and love. However, it is also about other factors, such as growing up, self-esteem, and finding yourself.","token_len":370,"entropy":[7.2792,5.5378,5.374,10.2819,0.7438,3.0795,0.4586,9.3503,11.6474,7.7766,4.1417,7.4737,6.5314,0.3275,4.5775,11.6783,2.5696,2.9703,5.5444,0.4777,1.5552,12.8838,16.5171,9.1106,2.6723,6.0431,1.3177,1.4791,7.3519,1.4811,0.1153,2.0541,3.426,0.0419,1.0283,1.9365,3.483,2.7627,3.0529,3.959,5.3139,1.4532,3.2696,0.0784,0.2178,2.8035,6.7601,8.5242,0.2722,11.4511,0.1476,0.4272,4.7013,0.5001,5.2653,6.096,0.0371,0.6227,2.6921,9.0433,2.8145,3.9362,5.5721,1.301,0.1349,7.5782,4.0692,3.0322,3.7288,1.4095,1.8595,2.3529,1.5312,0.0034,0.6879,0.0817,0.716,0.033,0.3478,4.0209,5.0256,0.159,2.6438,1.5465,0.4067,0.6905,0.7733,3.4752,5.0392,4.0457,1.1098,0.7804,4.0004,2.0467,5.9201,0.8403,1.6832,1.9175,4.1232,5.489,0.2704,2.9162,0.9285,4.1533,4.7877,7.2223,0.8554,2.4219,3.213,0.5369,0.7804,1.6857,5.4472,2.6219,6.4988,3.3109,1.3276,0.9897,1.5289,6.8357,4.7368,2.3272,2.4085,2.9516,3.0182,2.3715,3.385,0.125,3.304,2.1301,0.2675,1.1822,1.6547,3.7798,3.1423,3.8764,2.1904,2.4166,3.5009,5.8425,5.4556,2.4193,7.0405,0.5491,1.4153,2.1451,0.4304,0.5746,3.943,2.1834,4.3289,0.9745,2.2665,0.6372,5.6274,2.7014,0.541,0.9855,0.4494,2.7145,3.2813,2.797,5.6109,2.6624,2.1127,1.1606,6.2188,4.0397,2.9007,0.4547,2.0134,2.7444,1.7353,1.5372,5.3674,3.7289,1.6883,0.4304,1.9801,2.9767,4.3212,1.9273,4.9679,0.264,2.7411,6.2699,3.6295,3.2735,5.2897,2.252,4.6711,2.0582,6.8329,9.6486,0.0218,1.1463,3.2849,0.2576,0.5672,1.0398,2.0424,1.2286,2.8086,2.9664,1.3064,3.8398,2.116,7.4787,5.159,1.8178,0.7442,2.5198,0.0135,1.1731,0.321,3.0279,1.4382,6.882,0.6498,5.7352,2.4196,5.8899,0.2006,1.5366,7.4445,3.0515,5.3458,0.4462,4.3837,0.366,5.4059,3.7008,0.3816,0.4999,5.4562,0.2536,2.6073,0.0757,5.0334,2.2924,0.0599,0.3101,2.9927,3.2654,0.0571,5.3522,2.7862,6.0343,0.2472,3.6316,0.1604,1.6139,6.1999,0.147,6.3907,1.2602,3.9163,0.0764,3.9863,0.4505,1.1516,3.2992,3.2563,4.4622,2.4418,2.7741,1.7453,3.8632,3.834,0.0109,3.5401,2.24,3.7408,0.2416,0.2589,3.7843,1.5089,0.0012,1.4397,6.7997,14.6407,8.1197,4.7647,1.3367,5.4903,6.0426,0.8814,5.4606,4.2704,0.0068,0.0046,0.0001,0.002,0.9144,2.8921,0.9375,4.9272,1.0579,5.8978,2.7871,9.6911,0.4905,0.0088,3.0809,2.6603,3.7361,0.0233,3.2133,0.9649,0.3154,3.5774,0.3946,1.2193,5.1871,0.0545,7.4804,5.3572,0.2769,2.6581,4.3011,0.5336,4.4425,4.0827,2.9097,1.1839,0.8272,0.9276,4.1777,3.3267,2.4211,1.6029,12.187,0.0409,3.9631,0.1365,6.237,3.7708,3.0303,3.4006,5.9995,1.744,4.6057,2.2492,5.184,0.8804,2.6743,1.1695,2.2536,0.0312,2.3896,1.3675,0.6959,1.5246,5.266,5.7651,1.199,0.402,0.0013,6.3645,0.0514,2.7344,6.7121,0.0992,1.5761,0.4653,0.6308,4.6802,4.0106,2.643]}

Some stars may even be close to 13 @. @ 8 billion years old \u2014 the observed age of the universe. Some stars last 10 trillion years, but for us, they are only a few % of our lifetime.\nThe sun is a red dwarf in the hydrogen-helium stage (the red section of the Hertzsprung -Russell diagram). A few %, it will be in the third stage \u2014 iron stage. As it burns helium, iron and magnesium, its core will rapidly cools, its density increases and it expands.\nOutside the visible zone, another zone where the sun burns hydrogen, but in a different stage, called a helium star. When the core of the star is cooled further, a new star forms inside the remnant.\nAbout two billion years ago, star number one was cooled to a hydrogen stage, which corresponds to temperature of 1 Million C.\nAt that stage, the star has the mass of 2.5 terramters or 3. 1 x 10^13 kg. By the laws of physics and thermodynamics, the temperature of the star has a limit of 2 000 000 C ( two million k ). With these 2 million C, the star can only use the hydrogen that is in the outer layers of atoms.\nIf the star will remain at 2 000 000 C for 10 times less time, a new star is formed out of the old, which has mass of 1 terramter or approximately 1. 6 x 10^13 kg.\nIf the star will burn hydrogen also through hydrogen layers of atoms, the temperature will be 1 000 000 C, which corresponds to 1 million K. In this case the mass of the new star will be 0.5 terramters or approximately 0. 9 x 10^13 kg.","token_len":371,"entropy":[9.7141,2.6853,7.7499,3.1947,6.3694,0.0649,3.3081,0.1845,1.366,0.0375,0.9469,3.9542,1.9826,3.1912,2.9828,0.9467,5.4874,0.2204,8.0443,15.8064,6.0334,4.0349,6.6565,2.3757,0.8645,0.2004,3.2646,5.4756,9.5124,2.8828,0.3286,1.1757,1.9246,4.2275,4.1966,0.6611,7.3879,4.475,4.3172,0.124,1.9939,2.1869,5.0417,5.2722,1.3806,2.6398,1.3611,3.0678,2.2238,0.7735,6.9576,0.4897,2.0057,2.7043,0.4454,1.6053,8.0489,4.847,1.1428,2.2802,5.6776,0.9232,3.8457,0.7208,9.4057,2.0999,5.2687,0.6314,8.2137,3.1452,2.8613,2.6584,6.3428,1.6876,0.3108,10.7061,0.0101,10.7937,0.0426,8.0767,9.0289,3.7014,0.915,4.102,3.2371,7.5848,6.5071,5.0251,4.3326,1.0175,3.408,0.6622,6.44,2.192,5.53,8.4912,6.9515,1.2947,4.628,2.8254,5.745,7.3209,0.8976,5.6307,4.1805,5.8131,2.8141,4.1145,4.2255,2.5507,5.5181,1.6997,9.0349,1.6985,4.8816,4.2378,2.8889,0.9557,1.4442,3.6695,0.7708,2.1538,9.3734,1.1311,4.6053,5.5561,0.6025,6.4526,7.4558,4.2932,1.2755,1.0715,4.7165,2.1309,1.7567,4.8762,3.8291,1.9547,2.8215,5.6863,0.9315,4.7763,2.9678,5.536,4.6945,1.3389,4.1155,1.1384,3.9604,2.3362,1.1676,1.4417,1.466,2.3294,6.3155,0.7047,4.4407,3.749,1.9769,3.557,5.0237,1.0597,5.6088,1.7409,1.7966,6.2419,4.4421,1.0869,0.0936,0.4675,0.2164,5.9654,8.3126,2.7626,1.3921,9.4433,1.4092,2.5398,6.554,4.6663,1.5295,2.4858,7.8112,0.1676,8.8411,1.7177,3.1865,8.4077,3.7047,0.7438,2.0842,3.5336,1.6176,3.4602,0.3185,0.9973,1.8894,4.4199,4.5343,4.0525,0.689,2.8107,1.4112,1.0737,6.9246,10.2737,7.8117,4.7305,3.9043,1.5993,8.6082,6.1791,0.6227,1.1615,4.5434,2.8529,0.9118,5.2285,1.5011,8.2883,0.0414,0.9889,3.8643,4.7649,0.0048,0.134,1.5407,3.6308,0.5345,0.845,1.1037,3.5258,3.5257,5.0235,0.3191,2.517,5.3298,3.1601,0.5705,2.9128,11.1819,1.8323,5.5293,10.851,5.9875,4.1868,6.4512,2.5391,5.893,1.5333,0.6738,1.0778,3.1252,2.4133,6.8658,2.9394,2.495,4.307,1.5927,2.4978,0.8916,4.6169,2.6308,0.3577,6.6602,1.0393,1.0833,4.2873,0.8962,1.1354,6.551,4.4493,2.4835,3.6689,0.4828,0.022,0.2252,1.3812,3.1099,4.3118,5.7641,0.4754,0.7314,4.5812,1.9907,0.3651,3.0568,1.6536,5.8069,0.0496,0.8052,3.9349,3.5865,2.4046,2.743,5.2341,1.1913,1.8971,3.0097,0.0304,1.5761,0.3064,7.2881,1.8935,1.436,5.5738,0.8486,0.0997,0.065,0.795,0.05,0.3467,0.9976,3.0316,0.5812,0.5485,1.3125,2.9951,2.4516,7.8893,6.3507,4.2523,6.5417,3.1248,1.5194,0.4525,1.8368,3.6165,1.9515,1.5706,3.1099,2.3903,0.0279,0.0393,2.3577,1.7274,1.1825,0.0281,3.398,1.7875,3.1226,0.7611,3.8595,1.6402,1.2476,2.7305,4.6315,0.2745,0.2673,2.1959,0.0703,0.9826,0.4722,4.3865,0.0706,2.6987,1.6973,0.0319,0.3528,0.3381,3.1503,1.6697,0.0036,5.4243,0.1114,0.0448,0.0154,0.1356,0.0191,0.33]}
{"prompt":"The Mekong River remained free of dams until 1993 because of its complex system of rapids which wreck boats , and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course of some of its branches .","text":"The Mekong River remained free of dams until 1993 because of its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course of some of its branches. In fact, Vietnam may have been ahead of the rest of Southeast Asia in removing large dams from its waterways, due to the fact that its rivers lack the typical run of rapids that would make it necessary to build dams. After the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the restoration of Vietnamese sovereignty during the early years of its development, Vietnam has made very few major decisions on dam constructions.\nDuring the past two decades, the number of hydroelectric dams has declined dramatically, particularly for larger ones. However, the average size of these large dams has increased. Many large dams, mainly on the Mekong and Red rivers, have been converted to generate both electricity and irrigation. They have, therefore, become very large complex systems.\nThe recent boom in dam construction in the West and East Africa is particularly interesting in this context, especially for the reasons discussed herein.\nThe increase in the use of dams for large-scale dredging is more puzzling. Dam operations, including regular maintenance and refurbishing, may generate significant amounts of dredges.\nBut dredging dams to expand pumping and irrigation capacity, or to remove silt and gravel, is relatively new. Also dredging is not always an effective means of increasing water capacity. Sometimes it may damage the channel bed or even the dam itself. For this reason, in many instances the dams are constructed with sufficient width to allow the river to function without artificial manipulation, and only the channel bed is dredged.\nDredging has not been extensive in Asia or Africa, but may be occurring more frequently as the dams and hydropower investments move from the earlier development phases to the mature operations.","token_len":371,"entropy":[12.8322,0.2461,1.3349,8.5015,5.1728,0.666,6.071,3.0783,5.0975,5.0393,0.4572,4.1777,7.3525,3.8407,0.0389,5.9737,0.0124,5.0509,11.9846,6.2829,1.3204,3.4913,2.8622,9.0937,8.1286,0.1508,2.4602,3.1,8.8374,0.0028,1.1099,3.5683,0.0478,6.8006,1.5763,2.6208,6.9645,0.431,3.0799,4.568,0.1786,7.1994,5.6601,0.9322,1.8532,6.0585,0.1336,1.1338,3.7146,0.1211,4.2449,0.013,0.6644,6.1457,5.0457,1.3703,2.4061,1.6874,2.8647,1.7166,5.1139,0.2964,1.4654,2.5932,0.0658,3.3925,2.0521,5.158,2.0986,6.9153,8.5056,3.3365,5.1969,0.0034,2.4514,3.501,3.5604,2.7959,5.5034,0.576,2.2664,1.815,1.5385,5.7113,1.1908,4.3698,0.0172,2.4909,0.0013,0.9137,2.4795,3.3236,0.6294,5.4752,0.0553,4.8645,1.483,4.4703,0.2767,3.0874,3.0806,0.0344,4.9422,5.496,0.289,1.8092,4.1227,4.6608,5.7893,1.623,1.7833,3.8102,1.6375,2.9979,7.1933,0.0102,0.7995,2.1752,9.5289,0.3483,3.3707,2.5274,0.2261,0.2513,1.683,3.6219,0.0415,6.0517,0.259,0.1879,0.8931,3.0346,2.7762,1.3695,4.6374,4.0267,6.4544,4.5007,0.8958,2.9089,0.0097,1.644,5.1207,1.8491,0.1036,2.4615,3.9722,0.2254,1.0814,1.6192,4.6507,5.2575,2.7979,0.2153,2.8333,5.3973,3.9137,0.8795,0.9052,0.0062,2.3872,6.7656,1.7355,0.1579,1.1675,1.0631,4.4174,1.0601,5.1956,7.6711,1.8922,0.103,4.9158,0.8421,4.7791,1.6286,5.113,2.1907,0.0013,1.8818,3.6224,3.8502,8.8609,1.0681,1.4498,1.5667,1.8971,5.4698,4.6663,0.3457,4.2478,0.3107,1.3404,1.6089,5.4485,2.4632,1.7374,5.1311,2.2925,3.984,2.5097,2.9313,2.2993,1.4129,2.4282,4.3374,2.5502,0.946,4.5787,2.2314,6.731,0.1831,1.9256,1.4785,6.1216,0.1708,1.4756,4.527,0.0325,2.041,3.3649,4.6551,2.5347,0.0112,8.7596,0.0257,2.3349,5.1509,7.6912,1.7605,4.6765,7.1855,3.4015,3.6588,7.8213,3.7951,1.369,4.9896,2.238,0.7811,4.4949,5.4982,3.1915,2.161,0.0036,5.0911,4.3991,1.6969,4.2733,5.6224,5.4023,0.1792,6.6285,6.0734,5.9078,7.9846,4.2173,3.913,2.1875,2.3621,3.1063,1.1504,4.4285,6.6773,0.005,1.9926,4.7825,1.0381,1.6756,4.5538,1.9028,1.1362,6.2058,5.8868,0.0895,2.4742,2.4529,3.2076,3.3807,2.8581,1.6613,0.2676,3.2804,2.7735,3.2838,0.8958,5.3988,2.2236,2.1838,8.0713,1.5449,5.7779,7.3224,2.0938,3.7521,1.5754,3.5516,2.1679,0.4899,4.108,2.5901,0.0303,0.1346,4.3425,1.9002,3.2482,2.4118,3.772,1.6953,3.0786,2.0053,6.1419,5.3814,1.1697,1.2825,2.0913,4.1778,0.5388,7.0589,2.4619,7.518,9.3745,2.8004,1.7198,5.1725,3.6173,5.3228,0.9317,1.5226,4.6031,0.0032,1.0457,1.1936,2.9713,0.2507,0.0652,3.3012,3.6787,1.435,7.8715,0.8798,5.7435,2.8825,2.6378,1.3739,1.3001,4.8719,0.9409,5.1853,4.3794,1.37,4.7374,1.5874,4.8603,4.0491,7.0169,0.3299,0.0049,8.0963,5.8863,2.8949,1.908,8.6018,4.4698,3.0541,0.8929,0.5265,6.3713,6.4763,0.7813]}

Three men who appear in","text":"In November 2006, the BBC's Newsnight program presented research by filmmaker Shane O 'Sullivan alleging that several CIA officers were present on the night of the assassination. Three men who appear in the film's closing credits have been identified by CIA officials as actual CIA personnel who accompanied the team. The program's broadcast on the night (or the day) of 9\/11, however, meant that some American listeners may not have had access to the program until the next morning. While there is widespread criticism of the show's accuracy, no official reaction has been issued from the BBC. Following the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, some commentators suggested that the Democratic Party's John Kerry, who at the time was campaigning for the nomination, was a possible target of the assassination attempt. The theory of a Clinton-related plot has also been expressed on the Internet. On July 21, 2008, CNN reported that an independent group claimed that they uncovered \"evidence\" that the Taliban had been a primary sponsor of 9\/11 by identifying people working for the Taliban within the U.S. intelligence community during the attacks. The evidence, according to the group, was supplied to CNN by five former U.S. and Pakistani intelligence officials interviewed in London. The five intelligence officials stated that the Taliban had been financing some people who were at the heart of the 9\/11 attacks. On November 11 of that year another group of analysts, this time an Israeli one, released a report stating that, according to their finding of U.S. intelligence archives, Iran was the mastermind behind the September 11 hijackings and blamed Israel for instigating the attacks. They also said that Iraq and Saudi Arabia were probably also involved.

Its current facilities are a small area of shops surrounded by an area on the side of the original building which was converted and refurbished to provide office accommodation. In March 1974, Walthamstow Council bought the property from the North Western Railway and proposed a new \u00a313 million ( $21 million ) development of the wholesale and commercial complex. The new scheme was designed by Calthorpe, Pugh & Calthorpe, and opened in November 1974. The redevelopment also included new offices for Walthamstow Town Council ( now Walthamstow City Council ).\nIn 1983, the market was sold to Walthamstow Group for \u00a323 million, who have since expanded the wholesale complex and provided a substantial increase in the number of stalls, which now number around 650, with more to come if the market continues to develop. Walthamstow Group also own the nearby Walthamstow High Street as well as the Walthamstow Railway Station, which is now the centre of the business district.\nIn 2004, at the height of the East London riots, the market was taken over for a period by the police and used as a temporary base for security forces. However, the market was not closed to trade as the police could not cope with the volume of trade. The market was reopened to trade on 7 May 2005.\n^ a b \"British Council, London\" (PDF) (accessed 2009-02-19 ) \"Gloucestershire Market, Gloucester\"","token_len":372,"entropy":[9.2172,3.8804,10.103,0.414,2.9262,4.6524,8.1417,4.4908,5.1154,17.0601,4.2956,0.1957,6.2253,12.0348,11.7184,2.4637,10.5883,5.8256,4.8719,4.529,1.8396,10.4775,9.551,6.9428,0.0925,4.9335,0.062,2.8033,6.5342,5.0527,2.854,5.1133,4.348,1.898,0.5573,2.5618,5.2029,2.7836,2.9588,4.5413,3.6054,2.5287,4.2357,5.0986,4.0347,1.0073,2.3979,5.7113,2.2255,7.3629,7.2901,3.5941,1.4569,6.1179,2.3179,5.8149,7.1447,5.8248,0.5126,1.2021,5.4265,3.1928,5.6826,1.2975,3.9961,5.0744,5.5439,1.319,6.2576,6.7764,0.0458,4.1393,3.344,5.2973,0.4434,5.5807,0.1238,0.6096,8.0578,4.1347,2.436,1.7204,3.4287,4.7903,3.457,0.0095,2.4704,3.377,5.1575,3.821,1.3559,3.5815,5.237,6.173,0.9879,6.8755,2.9756,0.0072,0.549,0.0022,4.5805,3.4899,0.6535,3.1091,2.4133,1.3673,6.2091,2.4845,0.3011,2.2078,6.9162,2.0375,1.5935,5.2458,5.0221,1.1824,3.4303,4.5562,3.842,0.3923,1.122,2.6178,2.5815,0.5336,10.6614,2.759,3.3038,5.2997,1.1126,1.329,2.6996,5.2359,1.2814,4.3424,2.2647,5.5189,8.5203,4.1351,0.8852,3.0913,6.5407,5.2864,1.5654,4.8209,2.111,0.7356,0.0302,1.4041,2.2027,5.2462,0.6579,3.3825,1.1257,0.5743,1.3868,4.635,5.6248,0.722,2.8092,3.1595,1.9487,3.0648,0.0674,0.0013,0.0511,0.0031,4.9486,0.8091,2.858,5.9982,1.7864,0.1749,0.0027,0.2161,0.0154,3.3056,0.0572,4.0351,1.9452,4.954,4.9004,0.5122,1.1303,6.4077,1.4857,3.0888,0.55,3.656,0.2464,0.01,0.2318,0.0059,4.7913,1.3654,0.3579,5.0393,0.4394,2.2248,5.6419,3.4353,1.161,3.2183,1.0585,3.5581,5.627,2.1111,5.9578,2.3242,4.9161,3.6896,0.1037,1.9403,1.7707,0.043,7.1025,2.4727,4.0373,1.9319,3.6841,2.8727,6.4985,2.0512,3.2184,2.8595,3.5148,0.6407,6.0788,0.8784,3.337,1.4421,0.2748,5.1607,0.5365,3.6768,0.0088,0.0023,0.0144,0.0048,2.4324,3.2222,5.9051,1.0465,6.1735,3.9205,0.4056,0.0085,1.4885,0.0226,5.2806,0.8018,6.0621,0.6936,0.039,1.0884,3.1474,0.0848,0.0043,0.1011,0.0167,5.8237,1.4391,1.7332,1.2208,1.5896,1.7038,2.3242,4.4504,0.3872,1.2227,3.8151,0.9505,0.5748,0.8852,2.0519,3.6467,0.3097,5.4506,0.5305,2.3404,0.0021,0.5359,6.1642,0.8219,4.5588,0.4387,1.1547,3.4584,0.6352,4.6914,0.1366,5.6206,2.2411,5.1996,1.6734,1.0786,6.8946,1.3064,5.8079,1.1696,0.3706,4.2168,4.1471,0.6224,4.9232,3.9417,1.5363,3.7224,0.1525,1.8352,2.3869,1.5884,2.7407,3.3752,2.7244,5.1706,3.6703,1.8903,2.7685,5.2653,1.0054,6.0457,0.2179,0.6477,4.1182,0.1215,3.0851,2.2213,1.9586,2.5749,1.0848,2.0944,1.5415,1.4666,2.1459,4.3983,2.3206,1.5338,1.5339,0.756,9.5702,6.6042,4.1355,6.5856,8.171,5.0732,4.6699,2.3865,2.2051,2.5929,8.0432,0.974,3.7036,5.3048,0.1493,7.7473,0.6728,3.509,0.0152,3.4239,3.7087,3.6169,7.5971,1.6382,2.0693,0.0061,0.0003,5.1541,2.332,7.0856,2.3979,1.8487]}

The torpedo tubes were removed during November and the anti-aircraft armament increased to four 12.7-inch (300\u00a0mm) Mk XVI guns. The boat underwent another major refit and alteration in June 1941 and was laid up and out of commission until December when she was recommissioned and laid up again. She was out of action for the rest of 1943 when she was disarmed and placed on dry-stock in May 1944. She was purchased by the British government in June 1944 and transferred to the Admiralty in September 1944 as HMS\u00a0Cormorant and designated MGR\u00a01.\n\nPost war career\n\nAfter a refit, Cormorant was deployed with the Northern Group and the Scilly and Orkney Islands Force on Operation Northbridge in January 1945. On 22 January 1945 she bombarded Plymouth and Rotherhithe, Devon killing 31 civilians. She undertook escort duties for convoys of troop vessels between February  and March 1945. For the next two years she served with the Home Fleet. She was assigned to the Antique Fleet with a refit and alteration from 9 February to 1 July 1946.

IGN's Thomas added that the hand @ - @ drawn style of Yoshi's Island made the computer @ - @ game look unique and appealing. And the design of the level editor made the game easier to create. Although more challenging than later video games on the system, it was still very easy for the player to pick up and learn how to play.\nAt E3, Bandai Namco reported that Yoshi's Island has sold 25 million copies since its August 2000 release, surpassing Mario's first entry. On July 1, 2016, the game has sold 25.4 million copies.\nThe game had been in development for approximately four years before its July 1999 release. The creator of the level editor, Hisashi Eguchi, had to take a break, and the level editor was left to Chris Sawyer. A video showcasing Yoshi's Island was shown at Nintendo's North American Press Conference in August 1998, but the game was not announced until the following month. It was developed using the TightVNC graphics program, which allows game developers access to the console's graphics chip as if it were a dedicated graphics card. The level editor used the same technology. Although Nintendo had initially attempted to release Yoshi's Island on a different Japanese console with improved graphics ( Super Nintendo Entertainment System ), the developers had problems with it. Nintendo was not able to overcome the difficulties in the graphics editing process, and thus Yoshi's Island was the only NES game to have used this level editor technology. Before Yoshi's Island, the level editor had usually been used on more expensive, more advanced computer systems. It was the level editor which made Yoshi's Island much easier to play and create levels, as the console's graphics processing speed was sufficient to render the entire video game, despite the use of hand-drawn graphics.","token_len":374,"entropy":[10.82,3.2968,5.1826,11.5765,0.544,1.521,6.1834,6.6819,0.6098,6.0571,4.4595,3.6545,3.2098,1.2453,9.833,1.8385,7.5231,12.2605,0.9689,1.705,10.1831,13.2101,9.1555,5.3601,10.9757,6.9906,1.5147,0.552,1.4312,0.3416,4.6724,2.8335,8.9783,10.3065,2.5064,1.0801,5.0158,3.7726,6.0409,1.4732,5.5863,0.6042,5.0957,2.99,5.3307,0.9535,1.2175,6.7778,4.5684,2.75,1.5823,1.2872,4.2024,0.1932,4.1638,0.8586,6.5546,5.9037,4.6271,0.5934,7.3763,6.3309,0.4013,4.2605,0.8252,3.012,0.1103,1.8857,1.4276,1.2741,2.8575,3.3387,2.4212,1.4119,1.3397,0.1115,3.5823,0.3789,1.5794,4.8841,2.1545,0.2081,0.7426,1.0024,1.4135,11.2304,3.8514,0.0123,1.2075,8.2881,0.0032,0.1148,0.0,6.9384,0.2962,1.9339,0.7842,0.0304,3.7378,2.7007,5.596,0.3054,0.5418,3.0334,0.6098,6.4569,6.3564,0.3375,1.8091,4.6716,0.0004,4.3338,1.8673,4.4366,5.7776,1.9393,5.3505,4.257,3.3996,0.4403,4.2437,0.0958,2.0824,1.1749,4.2313,1.0136,4.5833,1.9153,2.3086,0.016,0.3524,1.9667,0.9446,2.8235,1.5821,5.0963,2.0917,2.2494,0.2137,0.4377,5.1108,2.6172,0.3494,2.4472,2.8134,4.4462,3.6936,0.4072,0.5825,2.1681,6.969,1.0476,1.1397,4.1027,0.251,0.8457,9.8445,0.7018,6.9181,0.3158,0.1732,2.9878,4.9287,3.7448,1.4697,1.3751,4.6097,1.7326,2.6826,4.1993,0.1422,1.1748,4.187,1.6823,7.9896,5.4482,1.8984,4.1931,5.308,6.1002,3.4943,0.0997,0.0459,2.3318,3.0586,1.1229,3.9885,0.6006,4.4756,0.1916,4.8572,1.7245,1.5312,3.37,3.6892,1.3994,2.6324,1.6075,0.8504,0.9806,1.8573,4.5347,0.7806,2.5265,1.6957,1.888,0.1855,3.4159,0.7518,6.1803,4.8087,1.333,13.273,7.4616,4.357,5.485,4.8996,1.3733,1.1745,3.548,4.5248,0.8902,6.6012,0.0111,1.5072,6.362,0.6208,2.0963,4.9349,4.7176,4.0299,0.4992,0.1604,0.7768,6.2271,2.2211,0.2122,0.1942,1.9062,3.3859,0.0337,4.8977,1.9548,2.1057,4.6629,5.4258,5.5627,4.9621,2.3689,3.7285,5.1287,0.0748,2.8871,1.1953,0.1686,0.0373,1.5171,1.8532,4.5615,8.2139,1.0182,4.3143,5.4247,0.5414,4.1548,10.1372,2.8435,1.8901,0.0153,2.8543,1.4021,3.7481,3.0532,6.6137,1.0114,3.7967,1.5122,3.3468,3.265,3.6294,1.1722,0.0031,6.1789,1.0136,2.2342,3.1835,1.768,4.8287,6.649,1.4894,1.5323,0.9632,4.7015,3.8222,0.1379,0.0419,0.7285,5.3879,1.6087,5.5141,0.6841,1.2294,2.1245,6.494,3.7103,5.6697,0.0608,6.0424,0.3523,7.1847,2.5558,0.0792,0.0334,1.8036,1.4297,2.4137,0.0329,2.4337,8.1619,1.0679,0.9282,2.3532,5.2608,2.6464,3.6703,2.3381,3.4736,4.7743,1.4565,0.8603,3.3442,0.7216,3.5398,6.4113,0.0454,3.6531,2.8556,1.1186,0.176,0.026,5.1735,1.0547,0.2619,2.3885,2.3748,4.6899,5.7983,2.0857,2.622,2.5948,5.6766,1.267,0.7013,3.7637,3.7255,0.8088,6.2498,0.4807,1.8487,1.7007,4.599,6.6205,2.1587,3.7082,5.4724,0.5791,5.1892,0.0029,7.6283,1.1027,0.1391,1.6288,0.3499]}

He split the 1916 season between the Grays and the Boston Tigers; he was a member of the Tigers, then called the Boston Stingrays, for the remainder of that year. Pennock played in seven games for the club in 1917.\nPennock played for Scranton in 1918, making only 16 appearances with them before the strike forced him to turn professional. He signed with Cincinnati, and had the highest earned run average (ERA) over the first 50 games as a starter in 1919. That season, Scranton selected him in the first round of the 1920 Major League Baseball draft. Despite a strong performance in his first two seasons back from the disabled list in 1920 he was again injured and was sent to Pittsburgh for the season. He played for them in 1921, and was traded to the Yankees for shortstop Bill Sweeney, in March 1921, along with three draft picks in May.\nIn the summer of 1921 he was traded to the Brooklyn Yankees for minor league left fielder Bill Brown. He was again with the Brooklyn Yankees in 1922 and 1923. While he was with the Yankees in 1923, he received one of the largest contract extensions in baseball.  He was finally traded for Dick McDaniel in June 1927.\nPennock played seven seasons for the Brooklyn Yankees, retiring in July 1931 after an injury caused him to miss 30 games. He then served as the manager of Brooklyn between November 1930 and October 1931.\nAfter the end of his playing career, Pennock became a bookkeeper for the club.\nAfter his playing days ended, he spent the next few decades in the South Florida community of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He died on February 28, 1965, from a heart attack.","token_len":375,"entropy":[2.9505,6.9548,11.1308,1.6569,2.9251,1.8706,0.4599,1.1279,3.721,0.0144,11.4269,0.015,11.1808,4.6075,1.0762,0.8735,9.0004,8.5506,0.2057,3.7054,0.1446,3.9196,0.0697,1.8649,3.7042,4.6703,1.8433,2.0128,0.0007,0.2489,12.7314,0.0342,0.3269,2.5483,6.9894,0.9894,7.0233,0.1717,0.1475,1.5219,3.6529,0.0172,0.2925,0.7509,2.6876,6.7062,5.751,1.3509,1.8429,3.3084,2.0266,0.0303,0.1901,3.6771,3.2143,4.2939,6.0698,0.2503,3.1432,8.4076,2.1417,0.5784,2.3944,1.0605,0.8759,0.0049,2.9863,1.6634,0.2799,1.8677,0.0013,3.4584,1.4287,3.7622,0.5668,1.0385,0.3464,6.3391,1.706,2.5161,2.6143,1.1922,16.5829,0.0018,3.4085,2.2413,7.4741,0.3861,0.0,1.9213,2.9117,1.0705,4.5333,5.4868,4.8557,1.3393,3.3396,4.8334,3.0642,3.138,4.6701,7.9068,0.4538,0.2649,5.2839,2.9386,0.5046,0.9593,4.2716,0.5366,5.9511,3.1769,3.4096,4.5401,3.3997,5.5975,6.2495,0.318,0.3309,2.547,6.1192,1.6909,6.2117,1.1862,3.6786,5.8061,1.0204,5.4,0.3791,1.6341,1.9533,1.9868,0.6447,5.9062,0.7288,0.5102,5.591,0.0001,0.0012,6.5922,1.3465,1.7806,0.1232,1.8036,0.0274,0.7927,0.0167,2.5933,4.3816,0.0698,0.2266,1.1178,0.8744,6.0667,2.649,3.72,3.5821,0.7464,1.9959,0.8087,2.5464,1.1725,7.7612,3.5779,1.8196,2.0946,0.0044,3.2382,1.8108,6.5306,1.105,7.1728,4.8635,2.4495,2.4986,2.7125,0.5352,4.2267,1.23,0.5952,3.2739,0.5611,1.6857,2.7879,3.4727,5.8638,1.0586,2.0077,0.9926,1.9794,1.8174,3.8027,0.3031,0.9785,4.1062,0.9756,4.7679,5.6709,6.636,2.1689,4.2154,3.9682,3.3902,2.2906,4.5504,0.0009,4.3892,4.26,0.065,2.7618,6.696,1.0459,1.2734,2.9011,2.5423,3.6727,0.0286,2.4993,2.8732,1.241,2.1395,0.2065,0.6798,5.1114,3.8412,0.6595,5.459,0.2707,4.5865,2.9049,2.8366,6.7317,1.318,1.2211,1.4642,5.9889,3.7888,0.1775,4.5179,2.3209,1.3755,0.7367,1.5645,4.1091,1.6631,4.6354,2.342,1.1332,1.1464,0.2972,0.2274,1.798,1.0811,0.6179,0.4841,4.2752,4.6507,0.9947,0.3847,3.8075,2.613,2.2111,0.5271,1.0445,4.0116,9.5068,10.794,1.305,6.2388,1.2807,3.8242,10.1683,7.0143,4.702,0.9976,2.9488,4.4895,1.3624,1.4168,0.9191,0.0067,2.179,4.9624,1.4314,1.3314,0.2653,3.6054,1.4203,1.1133,5.6661,0.7495,4.7435,3.3325,2.9246,3.9006,2.4709,5.4128,0.3481,0.0827,0.5212,5.8142,0.3519,1.1126,0.661,3.2481,5.2274,0.4908,1.527,3.3562,0.3994,5.9834,6.6034,5.8648,3.6235,0.0575,3.6516,1.1748,0.4695,1.6965,3.3491,1.597,3.8251,0.0008,1.9344,2.1749,0.1356,0.6803,0.2836,0.0014,3.8197,0.7874,8.0558,0.8321,1.2737,0.5313,4.7914,1.1584,2.6422,3.8679,1.6743,2.3723,2.8609,2.0823,0.6274,1.1235,3.7131,1.8689,0.7268,2.555,2.9248,1.6684,1.1655,6.5813,4.8527,5.2908,2.1124,4.9807,1.2852,0.8637,0.8922,0.6382,0.964,5.0172,1.6183,3.0959,3.2906,0.0787,5.0523,1.0972,3.6529,1.6212,1.0374,0.0474,0.6019]}
{"prompt":"The final race of the season was run in conditions that were never quite wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres , but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip","text":"The final race of the season was run in conditions that were never quite wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres, but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip to challenge for championship points. The start got off to a fantastic start, with the field running wide and with the conditions being wet, but the first lap saw the tyres turn into ice in some areas. Unfortunately for the field, as the cars began to make their turns for their home corners, some lost grip and started to slide quickly and dangerously out of control. Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber were the first cars to stop for emergency pit lane stops. Both stayed out for a minimum and both came out ahead of other cars, but with the wet tracks, they were forced to pit for a full stop to avoid stalling out and sliding down the field. Following Schumacher, Adrian Sutil and Lewis Hamilton were out in the lead and were fighting each other for the lead position. When the cars took their lines for the home pit stalls, both Sutil and Hamilton had trouble holding onto the track. Hamilton and Sutil came up on each other and both ran over bumps in the track. Sutil's car went to the left side of the track and hit a barrier, while Hamilton found his way on a bump and the car hit the barriers as well. Both drivers were on the ground and it looked like a full out race was on the cards. The race was called by the stewards for safety reasons. The two drivers were taken out and examined by the stewards. As a result of Schumacher's aggressive pit stall and the subsequent crash, he was ordered to retire from the race with what was diagnosed as an open crack in his tail wing. Fernando Alonso went on to score his first victory on home soil.

Many perpetrators have been known to be in a state of intoxication, or be in a state of high depression or anxiety. Often, the person is the first to experience medical treatment, which may be limited.\nThe most frequent cause of an injury in a burn patient is a burn. In the burns department you will see patients with chemical burns, thermal burns, and contact burns. All burns should be evaluated in a burn center. However, there are many times that a burn patient is treated in a burn center and then transferred to an emergency room for further evaluation or treatment. In a similar way, a patient may have been seen by an internist for an injury that was misdiagnosed as a skin infection, or a patient may see a plastic surgeon who was not an orthopedic specialist for pain in a joint.

Gosse has recently discovered a very beautiful species, which he calls I. acacia.4 Its cell-wall contains, however, a substance which he believes to be amylo-actin.\nThe cell-ends are also differently shaped, and are more or less flattened, but I have no experience in observing these points.\n\n","token_len":378,"entropy":[9.0626,4.5344,1.0628,5.9165,0.8987,2.0659,6.7882,7.6203,3.4655,6.0108,8.9663,2.4564,2.6342,1.8349,13.1071,13.8628,3.0206,7.704,0.1489,9.5688,5.0387,3.0463,2.5983,1.0772,2.7429,4.5413,0.342,2.8462,0.0463,11.3751,10.8835,6.0135,6.6524,3.2815,1.1487,3.8963,0.8984,1.9891,5.6211,0.2767,4.6549,3.1681,5.6781,3.8714,7.0261,1.3304,4.149,0.8913,6.3935,5.7294,4.3047,2.461,1.6363,2.1012,1.6704,6.4435,1.023,0.7768,2.9423,5.9183,4.0672,6.8536,0.5139,7.8586,2.8027,4.824,1.3833,2.8852,4.9946,4.074,3.6967,4.5417,5.7652,10.6902,0.0977,8.9821,6.1018,0.1793,1.4898,2.7198,4.2227,9.6074,1.5332,3.4047,3.3813,6.9811,1.9163,0.0298,0.0112,6.8485,1.0025,5.5108,6.8812,0.2692,2.4518,1.7282,0.9985,1.486,6.8871,4.6162,1.5336,5.3961,6.196,5.1841,1.2021,3.5601,0.0647,0.415,0.0093,0.0114,2.7278,4.2343,0.1863,10.0061,10.8032,3.609,0.3763,0.7052,0.53,0.0165,5.9001,7.16,0.4237,0.9029,2.5835,4.5715,0.7368,9.3366,2.2773,5.0445,8.9383,1.4122,6.6555,5.8158,2.2661,4.2972,4.329,5.2608,4.3003,10.4093,1.2514,1.2006,3.6842,3.5995,1.7855,0.5443,3.44,1.6217,0.0028,6.4482,3.8784,1.1665,2.0238,5.602,3.358,3.5956,2.1855,3.2421,0.5044,2.0733,0.8484,2.062,1.0521,1.3825,3.0204,2.4844,5.39,0.0109,8.0565,0.0985,1.3074,1.037,4.5932,0.9949,3.2429,2.8815,1.6299,0.0113,3.4425,2.4717,1.576,0.7103,7.154,0.5599,0.4955,6.2334,0.5569,1.5579,4.2454,1.4193,4.9434,0.903,0.665,0.7751,4.3682,5.6783,4.8726,0.0017,2.0711,2.8417,0.0261,2.4938,0.8658,2.0512,5.1757,0.9051,6.5628,0.3508,0.5239,3.5226,5.2362,4.7584,5.1954,0.5723,1.1872,0.7497,6.6826,3.4769,2.3413,1.5393,4.6848,4.2888,0.9292,5.5381,5.1215,0.5895,0.3548,2.9859,3.3886,0.1745,6.996,0.0495,5.1314,3.3122,6.5491,1.2887,6.4558,0.0647,3.1357,0.0464,0.0134,0.7811,3.2663,7.0056,3.6969,0.2944,5.2139,0.8694,0.9326,2.1657,5.9738,3.4107,1.2351,0.7452,5.3013,1.9689,3.5983,5.9938,1.9482,10.9065,5.4318,3.869,3.1815,0.3294,0.6953,2.3607,1.7431,3.2011,3.2145,0.605,5.4743,0.0065,1.0977,4.4978,0.3541,4.5288,1.2869,3.509,1.691,4.8701,5.9362,0.0322,0.3081,1.5185,0.0436,1.5373,5.5152,0.8328,0.0105,0.9266,4.9162,4.8687,2.3059,5.7218,3.7757,2.8193,1.8235,3.7498,0.5768,0.1084,0.6665,0.3856,6.9758,0.2036,4.1537,0.3403,3.9199,0.3246,8.4254,3.3301,3.5023,3.3332,3.8708,1.5067,3.1966,5.3722,3.7284,2.144,2.7517,2.3484,0.8512,3.3819,0.3836,4.6893,0.5417,1.0741,10.4568,4.5902,6.1868,0.3386,0.161,3.0063,3.9849,3.2929,0.0084,1.6566,8.4283,1.3798,3.675,2.6877,1.0407,0.2645,6.2897,1.7569,5.4269,1.4004,7.2776,1.5521,2.1056,1.1106,2.1925,5.2668,0.2758,13.75,1.4767,5.2243,9.2018,2.7011,1.111,1.0366,2.0776,3.7942,2.2957,0.0008,5.3211,1.4284,2.7297,3.7302,1.8361,2.2253,6.0537,1.7608,5.3406,2.9334,5.5471,0.5974,6.2122]}

Townsend has cited, among others, Judas Priest, W.A.S.P., Frank Zappa, Broadway musicals, and films as important musical influences. In one interview, he said that \" Iron Man influenced me, for example, in the way that he represents the human condition... in the way that his personality is a little unstable... but the fact that it is controlled within him by some sort of personal code. And it is about the personal struggle to figure out something greater that comes out of that situation. \"\nBy the time he recorded his third album, Townsend had become the resident musical director of television. He would soon branch out and find his creative voice in the film industry, with roles in many genre films. In 1990 he began to put out his own albums, including a Christmas album with the Muppets, and a second solo record under his moniker John Townsend in 2002 known as Invisible Inventions.\nIn 2003 he began to work with producer and composer Chris Addison in developing music for another of Addison's films and albums. From 2003 to 2006, he produced three separate albums for Addison, as well as composing the original score for Addison's 2008 drama thriller, The Man Who Fell to Earth. In 2007 the film's music was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. In March 2010, Townsend was interviewed by the BBC, as the result of a collaboration between the BBC and the United Nations as part of their annual Global Issues Report. Townsend had been writing a song on the subject of climate change as part of The Global Issues Project, a global campaign of British musician and broadcaster Sir Cliff Richard in partnership with the United Nations Environment Program, and was asked if he would be willing to conduct a world-wide telephone poll to gain a perspective on the issue.","token_len":379,"entropy":[11.4063,11.0882,10.1448,0.1823,3.1215,3.0372,0.5856,0.0041,5.6898,1.7988,1.0823,5.5051,3.2653,6.0543,0.2623,1.9465,11.5846,2.5552,7.3833,6.5798,1.1678,1.1569,0.0411,6.1991,0.3003,0.003,0.5409,6.3196,3.1953,1.9859,0.2021,1.7109,0.4468,3.1741,0.7256,6.1202,0.6834,0.0,0.2839,10.2396,2.9692,0.1601,1.5481,1.4881,8.3778,1.986,5.1954,5.7955,0.2756,0.5866,3.0153,4.8053,2.9729,0.633,1.009,1.9617,1.7455,2.5887,14.3747,1.8263,8.7705,1.1696,2.7227,5.0738,2.8038,0.7565,2.743,2.2348,0.9787,1.6596,2.9293,7.2881,1.1693,4.8657,0.9762,5.466,4.8822,1.5769,0.5556,0.4812,3.5836,5.3125,1.0554,3.3605,5.2966,8.9753,2.6443,4.1559,3.307,2.9077,0.3462,2.5314,2.036,7.1464,6.3364,2.4464,2.2812,4.0292,2.6398,0.0026,5.8646,6.0318,3.3515,2.3269,2.7069,1.938,5.2127,2.073,5.683,6.3269,2.8402,5.4983,0.0782,5.6855,7.7587,4.5354,6.0127,1.5038,0.1687,1.691,6.0634,1.8819,3.593,1.4098,12.5056,1.7929,1.1284,1.3971,5.8002,0.807,3.7334,0.4915,0.5305,4.5027,1.4622,3.2472,2.7161,6.9352,5.3152,4.0473,0.9703,10.1908,2.8672,1.4203,3.4145,5.6513,8.672,0.1358,3.2602,6.7491,2.6463,4.6227,1.3671,1.6286,1.8917,4.3173,2.962,0.9058,3.6392,4.374,0.4965,3.2092,6.8563,1.1052,1.9453,2.076,4.6955,2.274,3.6572,2.2951,5.7482,1.896,2.2016,1.2371,2.934,0.8961,1.9235,2.5954,6.5974,1.2645,2.3656,2.587,6.55,2.4914,0.0004,1.3998,1.5494,2.3857,3.9062,4.2948,3.4535,5.4541,0.9703,4.3211,7.3669,2.8753,3.8073,3.6756,8.2354,0.0868,9.9758,6.3047,5.6993,0.3605,1.5467,3.7469,2.6732,1.7546,3.0293,1.6858,2.9171,1.1242,4.5071,2.7093,2.4968,4.9474,8.4045,1.0075,3.3954,4.1551,4.5793,0.4461,6.5594,4.6874,6.6741,0.0007,0.0041,1.2048,5.4454,4.0182,1.1502,6.0625,1.7817,0.6994,1.4764,0.8105,1.3815,2.2315,3.3259,4.3907,1.4633,1.8093,3.4263,0.0001,1.8194,4.3563,0.0426,0.0189,4.8621,2.506,5.3625,1.5922,0.3697,7.8057,0.0011,0.031,4.9256,5.9975,6.04,1.917,1.8734,4.6448,0.6512,2.0282,0.687,0.0043,0.2623,1.1978,1.9913,4.7837,2.9586,3.7903,4.8503,0.7034,4.734,0.0503,4.6272,2.5097,0.3768,0.2465,1.9682,1.0856,4.9925,2.2965,0.703,1.2395,2.5512,4.5323,0.6811,1.6826,3.6184,2.9907,4.0917,3.2344,5.6535,0.0053,1.2106,4.9625,1.1041,2.1695,1.3568,0.7658,1.5707,5.5341,1.7821,6.0291,0.3106,0.0008,2.7595,2.9102,3.6115,5.6697,3.8969,0.4334,2.7369,3.6569,2.0351,5.0286,2.6403,4.4638,4.4175,1.3552,4.8123,0.7529,2.941,0.0089,4.7284,0.9734,0.0012,4.2913,4.8451,3.4651,3.114,1.0493,2.5694,3.2577,4.3644,3.2931,9.9316,7.1205,0.9016,4.8732,5.5212,6.509,1.771,4.2896,3.927,0.0011,1.2785,3.5344,0.0388,3.2106,2.0191,2.2667,2.1313,2.1139,3.7179,2.2217,0.2427,1.5781,1.2124,2.0661,0.0108,7.4788,0.8939,7.4957,1.7432,0.0666,8.3076,3.95,1.1682,5.8296,1.5789,5.9464,0.2497,0.7833,1.595,0.2935]}

{"prompt":"Key : Pld = Played , W = Wins , L = Losses , T = Ties , NR = No result , Pts = Points , NRR = Net run rate . Notes :","text":"Key : Pld = Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, NR = No result, Pts = Points, NRR = Net run rate. Notes :\nThe calculation of player ranking value in this experiment is executed in the context the player. In this case, there was one of the players, and its name was also written in the result set. So, the name of the player was set as the first criterion of the player ranking. The second criterion is an average rating of three players. It is called an average rating as the most important criterion of player scoring. If a player has higher average rating than an average rating criterion, it will have the higher player ranking value than the player with lower average rating than the average rating criterion. The final criterion is the player's net run rate. If a player has higher net run rate than a net rating, which is the final criterion of the player scoring, we will have a higher player ranking score compared to the player with lower net rate than a net rating.\nIn addition, we present the player ranking graph. Every node is represented by the player name we mentioned earlier. Every edge refers to the score of the player based on the value of the ranking score. Each node corresponds to the score. From the figure, it can be concluded that one player is considered better than other players. This player obtained the high score in the ranking.\nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel recommendation model for a sports match. Our experimental results show that our proposed model can generate better recommendations in terms of various quality measures. In future work, we will use data mining algorithms to predict new match from the previous ones. In addition, we wish to implement the system using WEB. This will enable our users to access the service through the Web interface.","token_len":382,"entropy":[6.8955,6.6851,10.9497,5.6969,15.1137,3.0647,5.9901,2.9997,4.9825,0.6503,1.0054,0.2914,0.5915,0.276,1.0335,5.4942,0.0849,2.992,1.2565,1.095,8.8528,0.0493,1.4977,11.5466,2.1708,3.4665,3.0362,0.2947,3.1808,1.383,5.5396,10.8232,0.1256,3.5208,13.2635,2.9046,2.4182,6.4245,2.2386,3.4519,6.3142,7.1238,0.9408,6.065,6.2404,6.7299,3.4498,2.8337,8.7268,1.0393,8.1807,2.101,1.698,4.1688,7.3718,2.5832,5.7886,5.0591,1.6381,0.6374,0.8019,3.9361,3.8652,3.9586,4.4457,0.5114,2.4966,3.1685,2.2501,5.951,4.9054,0.7207,5.125,5.149,1.4246,0.9361,6.1385,5.1333,0.5342,4.2476,1.1613,1.8205,4.3837,0.998,0.3706,0.4689,1.5545,5.067,2.5046,2.1027,3.5723,9.4399,2.2564,1.0603,3.3889,0.8436,1.6825,2.065,2.9192,0.0986,1.653,5.4028,3.5572,3.6065,1.3515,6.8444,4.1406,1.4133,3.9898,0.6994,4.6191,3.1711,0.746,1.0331,4.835,2.3405,5.1647,1.7394,1.2092,1.6272,3.3114,6.1282,0.4512,4.212,2.2445,0.3862,2.4307,4.8261,0.8434,0.4289,0.4485,5.4148,0.141,0.7078,8.4794,0.4198,2.4979,1.7839,2.9819,3.3976,3.2433,3.8752,0.719,1.9587,4.9936,0.5046,1.8321,1.513,1.5913,0.1136,0.0341,5.7723,0.3989,3.0166,0.4231,0.0672,0.1762,2.1649,4.3994,0.204,0.3904,1.227,3.0614,1.0788,4.2029,0.3532,0.0615,0.7199,3.1319,1.5215,0.0704,0.3149,1.2672,0.7089,0.0452,0.0209,0.0424,2.0247,4.4492,3.8423,4.7971,7.0491,0.6539,1.7872,5.3666,0.0824,0.7785,1.1643,0.3118,0.9929,0.3773,7.3125,1.7859,1.721,1.5531,3.0733,1.0726,0.1589,5.7585,5.193,0.181,0.4177,0.7999,0.1737,0.9891,0.0969,8.4112,0.8079,4.3957,0.4126,0.0137,1.4888,1.1802,3.2567,3.5185,0.7787,2.1556,6.4124,1.4994,3.5208,1.5021,5.4359,2.6346,5.9488,6.0543,2.1816,2.3091,0.6636,2.4504,2.7446,2.8728,7.824,5.758,1.7912,0.6463,4.3802,8.0768,6.7416,0.0353,0.7935,5.0484,1.0428,0.3518,0.8529,6.0192,0.0302,0.6428,4.485,0.2633,0.5264,4.3555,4.7201,0.6226,3.5293,0.7423,3.7946,0.0512,1.218,3.0617,5.0304,5.7606,1.0121,7.3177,1.2845,2.6345,1.7202,0.0265,5.078,0.0955,4.927,2.3067,1.9946,4.252,3.8346,0.291,5.377,0.3013,1.5005,3.0318,4.7302,10.0804,1.0027,5.5513,2.1816,2.8916,0.79,4.9831,2.8007,1.3125,9.563,0.3637,5.9005,0.0714,0.2848,4.9601,5.1584,2.3577,0.0212,5.7333,1.0524,0.4773,2.4557,1.5387,1.5267,0.7395,0.2927,6.1405,1.4097,3.6091,9.3183,3.6035,1.4859,3.6552,8.3493,6.2235,1.7215,3.8256,6.6838,2.1944,1.9901,0.1721,4.7312,3.4694,1.0015,2.3858,4.4956,3.2461,5.3386,2.9333,3.8188,0.0012,6.9154,5.6709,1.9191,1.0139,2.4655,5.6959,1.9548,0.3748,0.2897,0.7392,3.2454,5.6901,6.5412,3.0814,0.5338,5.0358,6.0391,4.1268,8.2869,1.4343,4.3802,6.2012,0.5372,2.6127,2.4873,0.1056,0.5438,6.7176,0.0356,3.8512,2.2598,4.7269,3.7052,11.3828,0.7242,3.8243,3.3847,2.2922,2.8233,3.8637,3.6641,0.0901,5.8711,1.438,8.185,4.5829,1.6839,3.2552,2.9279,0.993]}
{"prompt":"For several days , Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great amounts of rainfall to much of Jamaica . A maximum total of 37 @ . @ 42 inches ( 940 mm ) was recorded","text":"For several days, Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great amounts of rainfall to much of Jamaica. A maximum total of 37 @. @ 42 inches ( 940 mm ) was recorded at Westmoreland Hill in south-east Jamaica, where the rainfall brought down the hillsides causing severe mudslides. The rainfall in the mountains of Jamaica and the north of Cuba, which was mainly a convection storm, was light. The most significant and widespread inland rainfall occurred over the southern Bahamas and was from the N.E. or Atlantic tropical disturbance. The N.E. disturbance was first recorded off the eastern coast of Cuba on June 27 as a front which reached Santiago de Cuba around June 28. This front moved rapidly north along the east coast of Cuba and then eastward across the Bahamas. On the 28th it started to move north-eastward and by June 29 had swept off Nassau on its track. The next day it entered the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and within the next day or so it became the very weak N.E. precursor to Nicole that we are studying. It brought heavy rainfall to the Jamaica Isthmus from west to east and north and south of the island. The storms associated with the N.E. precursor were also responsible for bringing much rainfall to Westmoreland Hill as well as the Caribbean islands. A maximum total for the N.E. precursor of 27 inches ( 700 mm ) was recorded in south-east Jamaica. The circulation in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where the N.E. precursor made an isolated landfall the previous day, was very weak and the low-level wind field from the southeast was in the right location for the generation of very persistent cloud bands just above the base of these bands. A similar low-cloud band also existed over the west coast of Jamaica. The cloud bands at times occurred on more than one side of the island.","token_len":383,"entropy":[6.878,2.4668,0.7046,9.4867,2.2183,9.0269,10.0189,15.2624,6.5016,6.7005,5.6679,0.0041,4.6118,1.1099,5.1567,0.0173,7.6862,1.1183,4.0503,8.0445,7.4535,0.2271,5.8629,12.6961,6.1196,6.2705,9.6007,1.8346,2.9578,9.4524,5.3152,0.7118,0.4276,1.9229,0.9618,2.3268,7.3735,4.8964,0.0045,6.7282,2.142,6.3954,1.2658,3.7132,0.7509,1.6479,3.4536,1.622,3.7949,5.9591,4.4039,2.6079,5.7509,1.5195,7.0581,3.8872,4.1118,0.3071,0.0716,0.9609,1.8331,3.3477,3.6221,1.6128,6.5451,2.9395,1.7842,3.478,1.5782,4.7114,2.0934,5.8824,2.7549,2.1862,2.5667,4.8401,3.7612,10.0539,0.8064,4.012,0.3773,1.7075,7.4864,2.7373,1.598,5.1807,2.6781,5.5856,3.6948,6.4788,1.6946,1.9517,4.3423,0.9289,3.9246,3.3969,1.9673,3.7878,5.8038,1.4846,6.5225,2.4647,4.1918,0.045,7.1566,3.6316,6.8635,9.1364,1.587,1.5791,3.8401,0.0629,0.1027,0.026,5.4782,1.3121,5.6918,1.8547,5.4811,0.9962,3.7669,0.8669,0.1087,2.5393,2.4639,2.8165,3.4131,7.3209,1.3265,7.7026,6.4154,4.5984,7.8013,1.2026,0.2397,5.7865,3.664,2.1686,0.556,3.2609,2.7347,4.4156,5.1212,2.154,3.9512,0.2918,3.9107,0.2328,0.3236,0.9644,1.475,2.6338,3.6566,1.7184,3.3169,0.4458,1.339,1.5136,3.6149,2.359,5.2384,0.0708,3.4491,5.115,0.9722,1.6458,1.908,3.3588,1.6323,0.7201,2.243,4.6021,2.2271,1.0992,3.4947,5.5793,3.4829,8.1093,0.0337,4.5387,3.1786,7.7434,1.304,1.3625,4.291,0.8965,1.6127,5.4968,0.8808,4.5279,4.9004,0.2768,1.0256,1.9756,2.6131,6.2551,2.613,1.0397,3.2624,4.1097,1.3652,1.1961,4.3142,2.3837,6.8872,7.8809,5.6332,0.015,0.1496,0.0426,9.9806,3.7378,11.645,4.2079,5.1942,2.1662,7.1952,1.0421,2.2045,6.3079,3.7594,1.2752,1.3373,1.5795,6.7843,7.9921,2.0308,0.0008,3.8814,5.8359,0.7225,0.4028,1.7723,4.1236,3.6214,2.0978,4.04,1.1771,2.653,0.9298,1.4809,5.0317,6.683,0.0249,1.1068,0.7545,0.002,0.001,0.0464,1.8196,1.6953,3.6414,5.594,0.0115,5.6063,3.6522,3.3699,0.5953,5.6373,0.1938,0.0003,0.2014,4.8371,0.8814,0.5956,1.6775,4.7869,2.0478,0.8069,3.9428,2.7409,1.806,8.5874,0.8673,2.2803,0.0011,0.0016,0.034,0.7244,3.5749,5.9474,0.6888,0.4957,7.5713,0.0216,0.0497,0.4343,0.0975,1.7195,5.9511,0.1809,0.403,0.2604,2.0024,1.2182,9.764,2.552,0.8939,6.0372,2.292,0.373,0.0492,2.9951,3.2666,0.8646,0.6365,0.0007,0.0008,0.0256,0.2131,5.3048,5.7779,6.7145,0.5523,6.207,3.1645,1.0666,0.2342,0.7099,3.1734,2.4648,1.6426,2.348,5.8633,2.5663,2.2506,4.464,7.9381,3.8533,0.9041,5.2481,1.7668,4.7126,2.028,5.2251,5.3897,2.0165,1.4805,8.0611,0.073,5.3914,7.8551,6.2831,6.6335,8.3085,2.3279,0.7055,6.4316,0.2636,6.5633,1.1779,0.2137,3.3271,6.4641,3.6863,0.1944,10.3148,3.927,4.5247,4.0667,3.5497,0.6605,4.6197,0.637,0.1105,2.2832,1.4121,1.2141,5.3693,0.9817,4.3624,7.7867,5.1347,2.7928,5.908,0.7729,0.6785,1.1622,0.1329,0.3047,1.7125,1.4173]}
{"prompt":"Plum cake has historically referred to an early type and style of fruitcake in England since around 1700 . Raisins and currants were used , which in the English language were referred to as plums","text":"Plum cake has historically referred to an early type and style of fruitcake in England since around 1700. Raisins and currants were used, which in the English language were referred to as plums. It is traditionally made with a mixture of flour, sifted sugar, egg whites and cream or butter and milk. There is some variation in the ingredients. It was popular in the 18th century and early decades of the 19th century and, until recently, a favorite of queen Victoria. It is often served with jam in the UK.\nThe earliest recorded recipe for plum cake dates back to 1611, written in The Complete Cook's Apprentice by Thomas Linne. This recipe contained buttermilk and currants, and was called a plum and currant plum cake. (It is sometimes also called plum bread.) The original recipe is as follows:\nThis is a recipe for a traditional plum cake. See the section below for a modern \"healthy\" version. If you wish to make this cake a bit sweeter, add 1\/4 cup additional sugar.\nCombine the wheat flour and sugar, adding butter and milk gradually, and then incorporate in turn the eggs and spices. Form in a round or oval shape.\nWhen baked at 350\u02daF (176\u02daC), it is a light, airy cake with a rich, buttery flavor. Because a good deal of the milk (or buttermilk) is used in the batter, the plum cake is quite moist.\nThe original recipe called for sugar and buttermilk, but this modern version features regular, all-purpose flour. It is still soft and light, and sweet but not too sweet. The fruit flavor is quite pronounced, and this is the version the queen and most other monarchs prefer. However, my husband prefers the healthier, sweeter version, which includes additional lemon zest.","token_len":383,"entropy":[5.4461,10.9811,5.5035,8.3026,8.5596,0.0207,4.7784,4.8416,5.5489,6.9467,6.4873,0.4596,5.9229,3.646,4.3613,4.6767,5.7051,4.696,3.9474,0.6921,9.0546,2.6727,0.0106,2.1042,5.0402,0.9006,2.2443,2.1744,3.5604,3.9519,4.2143,2.5064,4.7396,3.7771,2.7996,3.1475,0.023,0.1096,6.3019,0.1919,1.0002,3.9333,0.9557,5.552,4.1052,0.8923,2.4258,3.056,0.0128,4.2139,0.7535,6.0189,1.5041,2.2996,0.5923,5.3751,1.9625,0.9648,5.3489,3.9696,2.3161,2.4482,7.5154,0.6289,4.2657,1.0579,3.1693,2.6616,0.5297,0.7074,5.2251,2.8758,3.5206,3.6307,3.8191,1.1322,1.1671,3.9804,0.0427,0.2146,1.8265,4.5203,11.3848,0.0798,0.1201,0.4115,0.0016,0.0868,3.0597,4.4227,2.6876,1.6343,0.0188,4.6979,7.0649,1.6146,9.1059,3.7599,1.0211,2.2915,0.6926,2.8953,2.3755,0.7795,6.5173,4.2462,1.7901,6.4067,1.2014,1.1319,6.8163,5.2964,5.7641,1.7775,0.7177,4.8511,0.2145,4.6593,0.2948,0.1557,2.6582,4.7954,1.3489,6.3862,1.6806,5.5194,5.0679,3.6369,1.6654,5.1992,2.0218,3.1217,9.7407,2.5757,2.202,2.779,0.4869,5.5849,8.1334,4.203,0.0002,1.5285,7.0095,0.106,1.0115,1.9098,1.675,4.1677,2.2329,2.964,5.4454,6.0208,0.105,8.6639,0.838,0.5219,5.1948,2.5974,1.1062,3.8906,2.4691,0.4026,3.28,4.6629,2.407,1.4903,3.5746,0.219,2.8853,3.9621,0.0208,0.2271,0.668,4.5582,1.7398,0.8858,3.6077,0.7162,1.2188,6.1814,1.2392,0.3971,1.3778,6.1679,1.4199,4.9208,1.9054,0.7289,2.103,6.2807,6.762,8.4935,0.4268,0.5236,0.4386,4.2774,0.2573,3.8145,0.2139,1.1066,1.8156,2.6095,3.7432,1.3858,3.7518,0.0003,0.4506,2.9188,3.4684,1.1249,0.9383,0.1665,7.2362,1.0055,1.5326,1.3208,6.385,0.0336,1.3662,6.9449,0.3816,1.4999,1.9856,2.3839,4.477,6.4562,0.9123,1.3814,6.3583,1.7157,2.2518,2.9891,6.5531,2.1627,8.5117,1.8368,3.4799,1.2967,6.3141,0.5584,6.0814,4.5171,0.4636,3.0365,3.0285,3.3927,1.6173,2.2181,2.0292,4.3183,5.5066,3.5521,2.0801,5.2937,0.0012,0.4457,1.6578,4.2189,0.0044,0.0038,0.011,0.4571,2.9669,1.5472,2.1323,3.4446,1.5977,4.3738,0.0117,0.7879,1.9776,0.5495,3.8717,0.7901,2.9579,0.0154,2.7307,0.2713,6.7445,5.1307,3.6693,5.8383,0.0724,0.9713,5.3212,5.1598,3.1994,5.7621,0.0177,0.0001,0.1506,0.4063,3.0878,1.465,0.4777,2.1444,0.1751,1.6488,4.4437,0.9735,1.4254,3.7866,2.3565,0.7193,1.2902,2.1315,3.535,0.2449,3.7638,0.7428,5.9147,1.7922,1.2901,0.0039,0.0001,1.2093,0.8294,2.3803,7.2312,0.3546,6.1256,6.3434,3.7989,6.0193,0.202,0.0516,0.4768,1.1157,2.6455,0.6055,4.4983,8.5238,0.8169,4.0211,1.2297,1.4744,6.752,3.815,1.1271,1.5266,1.0645,0.3731,2.2778,5.9669,5.7026,0.5727,3.3316,4.6788,0.9796,1.2028,4.2745,1.1393,2.3221,5.0908,4.7672,3.2814,4.3472,6.3271,2.4345,3.5077,0.0341,4.2375,0.1781,4.529,0.0311,6.8109,4.2861,3.7148,1.7901,8.0651,3.9847,2.5412,0.0002,0.3106,1.7957,1.1514,3.6917,6.0675,7.4023,3.52,0.008,1.7824]}

You should always use a casino that\u2019s not as popular because they often have the most exciting games and bonuses, as well as the highest payout rates.","token_len":384,"entropy":[10.1009,4.6848,11.1582,0.7559,6.2545,4.0853,1.1965,9.6632,0.4954,9.4337,1.7704,2.1033,4.7005,4.5826,6.1005,6.2192,7.9507,3.5366,0.0554,8.6343,1.1445,0.5132,1.0016,5.4258,1.2548,6.6387,9.7978,1.4249,14.0901,9.9211,1.1779,2.0863,2.7497,5.6994,4.3246,9.4675,3.4663,0.1502,0.3844,7.9481,1.339,8.374,4.5677,3.6473,0.8147,3.2173,8.4153,2.3526,2.7289,4.2025,2.1589,2.2807,1.5558,4.5023,5.0771,4.478,0.645,1.8362,5.2268,1.7656,0.0677,0.5723,0.3217,0.4359,5.7034,3.7364,5.5846,4.1181,6.4235,6.2246,2.6958,1.3419,2.6343,4.1539,2.9079,0.5985,3.7893,1.6636,4.8741,2.6309,1.3006,5.0977,2.5273,5.0159,4.0225,2.3675,1.5258,5.7517,2.2585,0.3371,1.5735,1.8906,2.4657,3.3487,4.414,0.4285,0.4262,6.7467,1.2014,2.1669,5.4555,2.2545,1.4961,2.3803,0.5244,2.2788,1.082,1.1561,3.5118,5.4866,0.8208,0.2337,2.5578,1.8768,0.7059,8.2252,2.3748,7.1834,5.4636,1.8205,14.0109,6.5714,1.5061,6.2431,0.018,2.4994,10.7076,4.9429,5.4651,3.0261,1.7513,1.4997,9.068,5.797,3.4216,11.6685,2.8365,0.0359,7.1851,0.5816,1.1298,8.8592,4.452,3.1618,2.43,2.8192,3.1813,0.6607,4.5759,3.5481,5.588,5.4756,1.9117,5.376,5.247,4.8829,3.2817,1.4525,12.5908,8.6713,5.0277,6.9682,7.9539,2.1137,5.0586,3.1238,1.6199,0.6743,2.77,2.3078,1.1785,3.143,7.1165,1.6591,2.1314,5.7575,1.4438,4.3366,1.9184,3.1823,0.1268,4.9851,6.0537,2.7133,0.6586,2.6096,0.0196,1.6006,1.1986,4.597,1.4991,0.0006,1.2176,2.3125,0.4531,3.1477,4.6483,3.1743,0.0096,2.8933,2.5627,3.7411,7.5506,4.0585,4.9349,7.1063,3.2177,2.0928,4.3677,0.0182,6.3002,5.597,2.1744,6.6305,2.1248,12.1535,3.5043,3.78,2.2799,4.2459,3.9029,6.1665,0.013,5.6046,1.3554,4.5778,0.6858,4.2452,0.7953,2.1651,5.6582,3.6721,3.2365,2.8457,5.5088,3.1085,0.2005,5.8123,7.8955,1.3314,0.8448,3.8896,0.377,0.214,2.7019,1.0816,4.6856,2.147,0.2676,1.452,1.7881,3.3419,7.3385,5.7883,3.0238,4.1028,1.1384,2.8333,3.9019,2.6682,2.3839,0.2835,7.5922,5.9141,4.1815,5.3934,12.6797,2.2098,6.6945,5.0454,0.7327,0.9897,7.1002,8.0665,5.0911,1.3983,0.2183,0.1941,0.7738,5.3459,1.662,5.4882,0.0133,4.5009,2.4106,0.2243,4.8551,5.5378,0.7236,9.5292,0.9688,3.877,1.1557,4.6268,4.933,1.5737,6.9608,3.4134,3.4532,4.646,2.0035,0.5755,5.2483,3.4808,5.0409,6.4232,4.3432,2.0652,2.057,0.1666,0.2097,2.9416,6.5284,6.3836,6.5351,1.7136,3.3067,1.2163,2.5193,2.7157,2.7703,1.4969,6.5963,1.218,0.3692,0.7231,4.2375,1.529,0.2745,1.1723,4.0405,2.0355,3.1086,3.9542,5.4445,2.1824,0.274,0.1498,9.2203,1.0427,0.2712,1.1667,1.3402,4.7603,3.521,1.1587,5.3172,6.4011,3.0863,1.9286,1.5529,3.2316,5.8766,3.877,3.9957,2.282,2.9025,4.1712,7.7645,0.1796,0.0053,3.0841,4.6563,3.778,6.6429,2.5917,4.9274,1.4789,3.5268,2.0403,6.3452,1.5096,2.5807,7.5658,1.1328,3.6544,0.9197,0.0493,1.5206,3.365,3.4828,3.2546,0.541]}

The land was originally purchased in 1800 by the Duke of Kent, who was based in the Duke of Clarence estate in Cheltenham, England. Bellevue House was designed around 1700 on the site of the former King William's Chapel in the parish church. It was added onto by William Penn in the 18th century and was used by the Duke of Kent after he retired from England in 1816. It was bought by the New York Historical Society in 1918 and reconstructed as a museum in 1951 after major damage during World War II, and reopened the following year. The house was restored in 1996, to provide additional space for exhibits. It is listed as an example of a Grade I listed building and has been part of the Society since 1983. The grounds of Bellevue House include an herb garden and a walled vegetable garden. This is the oldest garden in the Society's collection, and includes a greenhouse and a nursery.\n\nBellevue House Historic Village\n\nThe grounds of Bellevue House include a historic village created by the Society from a collection of individual historic buildings. It comprises 13 buildings spread over three sites and is primarily occupied by a museum and office space. In addition to the museum, the historic village comprises The Hospice, the Bellevue House Children's Book Museum, Bellevue House Studios and Bellevue House Caf\u00e9. This area is primarily used by the Society for meetings, lectures and performances. The interior is decorated with paintings by the Society's founding members, and each building includes its own unique characteristics, including a variety of historical features. The buildings include the original house, two bedrooms, the main dining room and kitchen, the library and recreation room and the barn. The Barn and Storehouses were donated by the family of William Penn. The House received its final coat of paint after its reconstruction as a museum.","token_len":385,"entropy":[9.7679,2.2541,1.044,5.137,7.236,2.0022,1.5925,3.3368,1.5265,6.1951,0.4358,4.175,0.6556,13.1558,0.2094,4.8374,1.4055,1.5071,5.894,0.9732,4.2988,3.1431,1.5308,6.7782,1.0432,1.4253,6.3715,0.2005,3.8803,1.3928,1.1867,2.439,6.8823,0.809,2.2039,5.926,1.7835,5.7242,6.4262,1.7059,8.3931,0.636,0.0004,1.101,1.5401,0.2354,4.7913,0.0046,0.1218,0.8153,5.077,5.4581,7.6661,5.72,0.9992,1.344,0.1021,1.0721,2.3551,3.8635,4.7276,0.9052,4.1287,2.2388,1.9187,5.6841,3.0357,3.1342,2.1959,0.6419,6.6119,7.1641,4.7302,5.1574,5.7954,2.0422,3.1926,2.1017,1.7997,0.1421,1.6546,1.4266,3.0686,2.1196,0.9877,1.597,0.1658,2.1391,5.7944,2.1065,3.8387,1.2203,4.2914,1.1177,0.8504,4.3332,0.1828,2.643,0.7944,5.9075,0.4324,0.8186,5.801,1.0009,3.3429,0.0396,0.4768,5.6282,1.402,5.7347,2.7166,1.0292,2.9869,1.6744,5.237,5.1312,8.028,7.0983,4.8611,2.3147,0.0094,0.2928,3.8411,2.1856,5.5074,4.7055,0.5846,0.0786,0.5966,1.7799,3.6848,1.0359,3.885,0.8109,4.8478,2.0028,3.99,4.9695,3.2321,1.9506,0.4528,5.3976,1.5554,3.1273,1.0097,4.7554,1.5056,2.7387,4.9552,0.1477,1.3001,7.0604,1.7028,5.4234,1.4484,2.8898,2.7578,0.931,5.7599,0.0078,0.5366,7.8884,1.9279,4.3532,0.1907,2.1368,5.7352,2.0716,0.5831,0.0016,0.0165,3.0925,2.919,8.9125,0.1884,1.7719,1.332,8.4212,1.388,9.0797,0.2158,0.8925,4.4766,1.8865,1.6186,3.7548,4.5436,0.6082,0.5189,3.2628,1.3548,1.3629,1.3948,1.2344,4.2956,1.5077,5.8522,1.6938,1.482,5.0166,0.7535,1.9246,0.0063,5.4395,0.0592,0.0026,0.0463,5.3137,6.0104,1.5383,0.0002,1.7228,5.1054,0.2227,0.4063,0.0037,0.0062,2.4136,0.8393,7.1074,0.9181,6.5083,0.9398,1.136,4.8001,4.1929,2.4879,3.4205,0.0322,6.6135,4.2652,1.9207,1.4181,2.5532,4.6593,6.2826,2.4406,6.2313,0.9751,3.1389,5.1564,3.6208,2.061,6.1452,3.147,0.0272,3.2077,4.9941,1.5352,6.3204,1.1397,0.3017,3.8946,1.3059,0.6261,0.811,2.1797,0.4989,0.9696,5.2041,0.3952,4.8276,7.8792,8.5279,0.4671,1.2499,1.7964,5.9002,0.0079,0.7003,6.123,0.0297,5.6681,4.3909,0.3731,3.1305,0.0033,0.1421,7.9367,1.3831,1.2445,0.003,0.0495,6.5573,0.2895,4.0242,4.5232,1.2786,4.8186,0.9546,1.0746,1.1958,1.9476,1.1978,6.6662,1.1789,3.2206,0.538,5.0864,0.778,1.3988,8.4032,2.1543,3.6359,0.3112,4.9375,1.9103,2.1408,1.6008,0.662,4.1824,0.4238,0.9602,1.9107,5.7515,1.8192,2.8049,3.6257,0.0089,3.2852,7.0991,2.2471,1.2651,1.2262,5.7329,0.0016,4.0672,4.9732,0.8957,1.2683,3.7937,2.1884,1.7877,4.6793,4.1796,1.1967,5.3004,3.2047,0.5777,4.0836,3.9055,2.4598,0.4977,1.2341,3.8963,0.583,2.1787,4.2544,1.0896,6.5774,1.6523,2.8797,1.2849,5.6917,0.6602,1.133,7.0288,2.9875,9.3394,4.5022,2.273,5.1497,0.9741,0.3934,5.4697,0.6904,2.5031,0.7284,2.2324,1.1556,5.0357,6.7402,1.2327,4.6747,6.4409,0.0234,5.6443,4.8226,2.1224,5.0699,4.0633,0.636,0.9194,3.1114]}

It is also part of a larger project by Danielle Foley and Claire Mullen called Dance on the Fringe.\nThe aim was to create a contemporary dance based piece of work utilising dancers in a variety of age groups and the use of live musicians. The piece has been described as a response to, a fusion of genres and a reflection on the environment. It was inspired by the writings of Susan B. Anthony and a quote from the play The Crucible by Arthur Miller.\n\u200bOver 100 choreographers were invited to submit their work, which was screened and judged by a panel from the English National Ballet. The winning idea, which was first developed as an idea at the Youth Music Centre, was worked out with dancers from the Youth Music Centre and choreographed at the English National Ballet. This work was commissioned by the English National Ballet for Youth and New Dance to celebrate the centenary of Susan B. Anthony\u2019s death.

Children","text":"There have been many studies done which suggest the importance of the paternal role in a child's life and benefits of the stay @ - @ at @ - @ home dad. Children who grow up with a father are usually more successful in the academic world. The studies show that children tend to be more popular, be in better physical shape and have a greater sense of responsibility.\nThere was a major study which was done on the relationship of father -son and this revealed that more attention was paid by fathers to their sons and that the sons of fathers were better in school, more likely to graduate and that was because they were paid more attention to them by their father.\nIt was reported in the study that the fathers who took more time to spend with their sons were more successful in all aspects of a man's life and it was also revealed that a father's emotional support helped their son develop into a better person.\nSome scholars believe that there is a major communication gap between mothers and fathers and this gap is affecting a man's self confidence.\nFathers can often be blamed for the negative changes to the boy growing up and this is because most of the fathers take on a more passive role in their sons'lives and this can give the boys little opportunity to develop and use their creative skills.\nThere is an even stronger correlation between father -son relationships and the well-being of mothers in a family.The fathers often take the position of caregiver in the home that is why it is important that the fathers play a more active role in the home. This is to reduce the gap that can exist when it comes to emotional support between fathers and sons and between mothers and sons.\nIn addition to this it was evident that the fathers who lived with their wives and their wives caring roles were less likely to smoke and drink and that the father and the son were more likely to get along and be in better relationships.","token_len":386,"entropy":[4.4819,0.1446,2.4276,4.8188,4.1459,4.0556,3.2657,2.9744,5.1877,0.0164,3.16,9.279,3.5972,0.8348,4.595,1.1606,0.0582,4.4773,2.3032,9.0571,2.2065,2.7318,9.281,12.6608,8.0225,3.3271,7.5293,4.5126,2.5337,0.5356,4.7283,7.4963,1.6837,6.4659,2.0542,4.9481,0.0495,1.4768,1.6741,2.048,2.0234,5.4646,1.8466,3.5793,2.0569,2.7323,6.2517,1.1615,2.1703,3.3224,5.9763,2.2352,0.5573,3.3885,5.4475,0.0275,1.6339,0.8436,6.4963,3.3643,5.7374,4.7622,2.7463,4.3266,1.8496,1.1463,1.9901,2.0857,2.4326,2.4437,0.0125,3.7806,1.3402,2.5752,8.2807,3.9842,1.076,4.2353,1.7849,2.5459,3.7787,1.6549,2.4603,1.6542,3.514,2.3875,3.2533,7.7116,7.5346,1.7993,7.4775,7.7527,0.4818,4.6114,5.7272,1.5488,1.0538,4.0263,1.4005,0.3194,0.62,2.2628,1.8119,2.5367,2.4695,3.3003,2.4448,0.7758,1.4561,3.6241,4.2225,1.3651,1.9375,3.0485,2.2673,0.0141,4.8961,1.8195,5.384,6.1419,4.692,1.1843,0.9663,6.2501,0.7623,2.8237,0.5189,4.1814,5.7331,0.3274,3.4703,0.3765,1.5725,3.3251,1.7749,3.7023,1.9839,1.2371,5.5118,0.7656,2.242,2.5277,2.2105,3.6822,2.8913,1.1404,1.2847,4.0076,0.2371,0.1458,0.8249,0.9595,0.9633,2.3159,0.9751,5.8458,1.7877,0.127,5.2465,4.6447,0.1187,0.1439,1.9094,4.425,0.8307,2.1084,4.5272,0.0972,4.1402,1.3451,1.2599,5.9049,2.9999,6.0149,3.8223,2.2768,2.9015,1.7998,0.4316,1.1589,2.6847,0.6569,0.7054,4.684,5.9729,2.1046,0.2731,3.3809,0.6103,0.8423,5.8323,9.5561,2.2306,0.4497,3.0988,0.1795,0.5899,2.1939,1.9559,2.2123,1.1199,7.2314,3.6748,3.1173,0.218,3.9934,2.902,1.2032,1.3317,4.0404,0.6066,3.9057,3.6289,1.1183,4.174,0.1891,2.504,3.4715,5.9974,3.7905,2.2392,3.9944,9.4656,0.0107,1.8551,1.8166,1.2116,3.8741,4.9875,1.2938,0.4737,2.8599,4.5841,3.5609,1.8265,1.886,4.9698,0.1407,1.0187,0.9848,1.7606,1.2246,17.3433,2.3711,1.4894,2.8955,2.4841,5.2158,1.9135,1.9905,5.521,4.2012,0.1597,1.7804,2.7546,6.2558,0.4572,5.3719,2.8969,0.5562,0.5203,3.1897,1.0832,3.4007,4.6339,3.7476,2.8805,0.1377,2.2378,1.8854,0.847,3.3069,0.2469,2.622,6.1045,0.7616,0.0091,0.0816,5.0393,3.1028,3.1661,3.934,0.8306,8.2283,4.0512,4.9582,2.7324,3.1136,4.5851,1.4746,7.316,0.0005,2.6715,1.3398,1.4716,5.7178,2.4265,7.1046,3.3511,0.3249,1.6862,1.5873,1.6291,4.3329,5.2435,0.7283,1.8526,0.3938,0.1434,0.2503,1.268,1.5293,0.9241,2.5267,1.1497,5.0579,4.7666,0.6002,6.6779,4.1078,3.2437,1.4162,4.2873,3.2429,0.1357,0.0156,5.497,0.7453,3.3102,1.6447,0.6608,2.8316,2.1005,6.5875,1.2328,0.2341,4.128,0.4274,0.529,3.4532,2.5997,1.0067,2.0007,3.5231,2.6506,8.1747,0.222,1.6334,1.5814,2.3472,6.4142,1.0102,0.1705,6.3337,1.9043,2.9406,3.8438,9.0056,7.9114,1.2865,2.7902,0.9248,0.0314,6.7563,1.4046,2.0386,0.9205,2.5276,1.5912,3.6075,4.0612,2.1844,3.5617,1.4303,0.987,1.091,0.0204,3.5435,3.5463,2.1918,2.6293,3.1447,3.0202,2.0951,0.6362]}

Even as the movement had become mainstream within American society, the Wicca Association of America was still not allowed to hold rituals openly in any public location in the UK and several other countries ; this ban continued until 1989. In the late 1990s however, with many Wiccans having become more involved within the Church of Christianity however, the Wicca Association of America was able to organize a series of rituals at a Christian venue in Philadelphia at the behest of a local Priest.\nOn a more public scale, the Wicca community began adopting more and more of the practices observed within the Church of England ( which had been formed out of the remnants of the pagan religions. ). The Wicca Association of America, by now, had moved itself into the Church of England's jurisdiction and could therefore hold ritual services within the public domain and in public venues. Further out, the movement was in no danger of being eradicated ; with it's new found popularity, it was rapidly gaining adherents outside of the established church structure. This allowed the Wicca community to thrive within the Christian community and to flourish with a newfound respect and acceptance from outside the church structure.\nIn the UK, the Church of Scotland and the Church of Ireland have both recognized Wicca as a legitimate religious movement. In the US, the Roman Catholic Church has not and has continued to refuse to acknowledge Wicca as a religious faith but instead considers it to be a modern religious practice within the realm of Paganism. However, Wicca is increasingly becoming accepted within the Pagan traditions and it is gaining widespread support within the Pagan community and beyond.","token_len":386,"entropy":[11.6362,1.1884,0.189,4.5591,4.7932,6.5046,5.7442,3.7704,4.0041,5.3012,8.3128,4.2302,0.4215,3.1216,2.2129,6.4413,6.8763,8.0705,10.0123,5.0078,2.4484,7.0991,7.8332,0.017,9.1441,10.9478,0.6825,2.6464,8.6774,7.1887,2.6049,4.4865,0.117,0.1556,4.8178,2.7797,3.7989,2.2722,1.3164,3.8813,2.2177,0.038,2.6225,12.8903,8.5424,4.0638,5.3382,7.066,0.1638,1.4766,0.0582,0.0858,4.973,0.8546,3.0526,0.2321,0.0026,1.5603,5.8408,4.5117,2.0254,5.5123,4.2977,3.3088,4.6252,5.3119,3.8036,1.942,0.2303,2.2238,3.398,0.0924,0.2303,6.7496,3.9485,0.7177,1.818,2.2657,3.2843,5.333,0.2298,3.1431,9.0822,6.8715,2.6571,3.787,2.2576,5.0689,2.8992,0.9129,6.8512,3.2956,5.2819,2.2402,0.7496,4.8831,3.2947,5.1014,3.2874,1.4858,5.0523,1.6012,2.2611,2.3651,2.4536,0.8174,0.101,5.8915,0.1044,4.6969,4.4835,3.495,1.3202,0.0033,3.4795,3.4813,3.4889,3.4123,5.3626,0.7449,4.2845,1.7074,6.5624,8.1518,0.7319,1.3874,1.8825,0.3432,0.1264,0.8239,1.2218,0.0417,1.8492,2.4779,0.0229,5.2568,1.1727,3.2356,0.0026,4.7774,3.4566,2.9559,6.3018,5.5002,1.0793,4.7954,5.2045,0.5705,2.6246,0.0042,2.3078,2.1,6.9292,1.2891,2.6,5.9929,4.1915,4.7335,5.7421,2.183,0.3841,1.2919,0.9104,0.1444,0.0439,5.3988,3.8214,5.8071,3.6265,3.5171,0.006,3.4924,0.6637,2.9354,6.4335,3.9041,0.7327,2.0756,0.297,3.2208,4.1613,7.9062,3.5409,1.7203,6.3412,5.0001,0.0034,0.9213,8.2004,0.038,0.7379,4.3691,4.9439,5.5171,4.3668,1.9571,1.7406,0.1783,0.1094,1.9566,0.6392,0.0609,3.0327,4.1329,4.7764,2.0636,1.1247,4.9358,6.9377,1.0702,1.1919,4.4694,0.26,0.3289,2.9873,5.5341,2.1086,5.687,4.2907,4.0462,4.1565,4.2694,3.489,0.8623,5.189,2.1822,3.3961,3.0421,2.064,2.7838,0.9967,6.3729,6.5958,1.7699,1.2867,5.2676,2.1287,4.5945,6.3782,4.9283,0.0791,1.3567,6.1323,0.003,4.2814,5.2404,5.4437,3.7536,3.9674,8.8543,2.9392,1.0388,2.533,1.3522,6.3617,1.3704,2.3024,5.9361,0.6991,0.4559,4.9898,3.0321,6.3472,0.5976,3.7378,4.6682,1.1585,0.844,0.0684,0.0651,3.1371,0.2802,5.591,2.9179,0.6631,5.2637,1.6001,1.5989,2.3065,3.7891,3.5756,2.4619,4.4441,3.543,3.0982,2.6235,3.0029,4.7286,0.8743,1.4554,1.2914,0.2463,0.9546,2.4746,1.7336,4.7722,0.5834,1.3125,4.0429,0.2275,3.1744,2.7722,0.8719,2.2506,0.0579,1.7524,2.7976,2.5886,4.4665,1.765,0.3644,0.0409,0.4728,0.4727,3.1373,2.1666,4.106,1.5994,2.032,1.7831,1.7112,0.3081,0.9427,6.4288,0.0644,0.2178,1.1251,4.1761,5.2154,1.2548,5.2963,0.1508,4.4427,0.5258,3.3728,1.2645,0.0476,0.009,0.5719,0.3006,2.4932,4.513,4.1353,2.296,4.4351,0.8788,1.7197,0.073,0.7067,6.7887,3.8553,3.3474,4.4468,0.558,5.7603,0.0036,4.2783,0.5614,0.553,3.6991,0.0488,3.71,0.2779,0.0391,1.7049,6.105,3.1914,2.0799,1.8399,0.5624,2.5547,4.7819,1.7274,3.7862,0.791,4.283,4.8908,2.1613,1.4795,0.6107,0.4741,0.6291,3.1131,3.3599,0.3974]}

{"prompt":"Gielgud 's performance is preserved on an EMI audio recording dating from 1952 , which also captures Edith Evans 's Lady Bracknell . The cast also includes Roland Culver ( Algy ) , Jean Cadell","text":"Gielgud's performance is preserved on an EMI audio recording dating from 1952, which also captures Edith Evans's Lady Bracknell. The cast also includes Roland Culver ( Algy ), Jean Cadell ( Mrs Jolyon ), Harry Blythesdale ( Lord Bracknell ), Alfred Brendel ( Lord Lytton ), and John MacKellar ( the secretary ). They were all taken from the company's 1953 production that had been staged at the Adelphi theatre, London.\nAs in the current production, the Bracknells appear to have a problem with a certain degree of sexual promiscuity - although more overtly so than in the current production -, and it seems there is no hesitation in using a sex scandal as a backdrop for political manipulation and a ruse to obtain the crown. In the current production, however, the underlying story - of a woman who seeks to improve the political situation in her country - is more powerful. It is perhaps fitting that this is the story at the centre of the current production, as the current Queen is not only the wife of a former Prime Minister, but also the granddaughter of the Prince of Wales - and a distant granddaughter of Queen Alexandra -, and a distant cousin of the Duke of Windsor. In her capacity as the Queen herself, in her capacity as a monarch by law, she could make a dramatic and permanent difference to all Australians - indeed, to all citizens of the British Commonwealth - by changing her constitutional position and standing up for the rights of the Australian Aborigines, women, and others who have been discriminated against since Federation. After all, as long as the British government has the capacity to remove the Queen and her heir from their constitutional roles, can they really allow the Australian Aborigines and other underrepresented groups to improve their lot without any of the same powers as are offered to the British monarch and her subject?","token_len":387,"entropy":[9.2611,6.208,5.3942,2.9728,7.2107,2.5134,10.4814,3.5841,4.4913,5.6467,4.255,6.3812,2.8959,9.49,1.3239,5.3131,1.5701,2.707,4.2169,4.9541,8.0521,2.2493,8.7976,1.7353,10.5676,6.7437,5.1082,1.6912,2.8887,2.2553,7.3641,2.2483,0.5604,7.902,9.6651,1.9345,2.7308,12.1089,10.2839,8.9539,5.4608,5.5876,6.0026,2.706,0.2992,6.8959,5.6029,5.3891,0.6713,1.3879,5.4919,5.3221,4.343,6.5584,5.2286,10.3278,0.1844,5.5256,3.8832,0.1868,0.004,0.5084,6.5519,9.5816,2.1393,0.1508,2.9443,9.936,1.9825,0.2979,0.4086,2.1383,3.7051,5.442,3.4881,5.325,0.1,5.1373,8.8384,1.4986,5.4592,2.7956,1.6069,6.5762,1.3774,1.0301,7.6644,1.2779,7.1434,3.1895,6.0738,2.7585,1.1364,5.4924,1.5922,1.0891,7.7407,1.8665,0.073,3.1166,2.5,4.1681,0.932,1.2845,7.1066,4.6215,1.0184,7.5424,2.3198,0.4289,1.3128,8.2578,0.1188,0.016,1.8003,3.9306,1.0563,0.8382,4.7196,8.5749,0.8385,4.0486,5.2351,5.7331,0.0137,5.4231,5.7546,0.0012,0.0029,4.0961,3.6181,6.5674,8.0799,2.9402,0.8145,1.2239,0.7082,3.1983,1.7665,2.3489,9.5398,1.7109,3.317,2.577,5.005,1.014,1.7757,7.1228,1.0292,4.2364,3.0164,4.8524,6.1885,1.2151,0.717,3.7245,1.2087,8.3181,6.9477,3.4114,4.083,6.9117,0.1715,0.8051,4.8817,2.3998,6.743,0.7364,3.2147,1.3365,2.8655,0.5969,0.4345,3.2433,0.0035,1.2075,8.4391,4.2705,4.7228,3.2416,2.0063,3.0784,1.2784,5.3308,1.2375,7.1,1.5171,7.1126,1.4152,1.145,2.5043,2.4389,1.0529,0.6023,4.3953,5.9813,1.5342,2.9363,0.6573,4.8023,4.6398,0.3263,3.0053,2.6341,1.3022,3.4889,5.0855,0.9657,1.8237,0.0078,0.6648,2.2813,0.7983,0.9809,1.6829,1.817,5.2866,6.5295,2.3808,3.5404,1.84,1.9267,4.193,0.095,1.6421,3.3317,3.7072,0.0084,0.8566,0.2488,0.6899,1.3968,5.5507,0.0755,1.504,5.2228,0.3299,0.0288,3.3985,2.2192,3.6106,7.1371,6.512,0.3684,4.4731,5.6935,3.1006,8.7364,2.2986,2.7444,3.9465,1.9943,0.4299,1.035,2.7273,0.0517,3.3039,0.6347,3.3153,3.6515,4.706,0.0191,1.822,0.8248,4.0918,0.1154,5.6302,1.4559,2.6954,0.0363,1.2738,4.4736,7.0037,3.3609,0.306,1.6692,4.6222,4.5911,1.8899,5.3125,2.454,7.4679,1.9641,1.0371,4.1598,6.5075,3.175,4.6709,0.5412,2.0437,2.1018,5.7333,0.9653,1.6048,5.9255,0.3767,1.3552,1.6974,4.7085,2.4993,7.8586,2.472,2.0324,4.7323,5.5381,0.5894,1.2487,1.4909,0.2373,2.0731,2.8857,10.9301,0.0127,0.2103,2.0813,5.1667,1.1026,0.7563,4.2994,2.355,1.9695,1.0316,2.0449,0.013,5.248,11.4027,1.3785,6.686,0.536,0.0395,3.005,4.8032,0.043,1.5419,2.7457,3.7591,2.319,2.7621,5.2188,0.2143,6.1267,1.518,4.0018,2.4201,1.701,6.9443,2.4948,3.8594,5.2246,3.0733,0.365,6.9207,2.0836,3.5512,4.4103,1.9294,2.7308,1.4242,0.0005,0.0727,3.2487,1.7797,5.4447,1.2902,0.6714,0.6258,7.9175,0.7774,7.5148,4.2939,3.1063,4.1471,0.454,4.6614,5.4879,1.9133,6.435,5.3892,0.6058,1.1305,1.3363,5.8765,3.2135,1.2799,8.1981,0.8655]}

A list of Registered buildings, including their location and dates of registration, is published on the Department for Culture's official website. The Registered Buildings (Listing) Act 1979. A building that has been registered is 'protected' so it must follow strict rules. This means that a protected building cannot be demolished or altered to any serious extent. Registered buildings have special planning permission. If a listed building is under threat, the owner will be likely to apply for an exception to consent or approval to change the building's use or the buildings' surroundings. The building may become designated as a Grade II listed building. This would prevent its use from being sold or rented, preventing people living inside or outside the building being allowed to sell or rent it. Under the 1981 Planning (Listed Building Conservation) Act, designated buildings are protected until at least the end of the century. The act also applies retrospectively, allowing owners of listed buildings built before 1980 to apply for heritage status once the building has been demolished. The Heritage Council for England (HCE) is the central body responsible for managing historical and historic properties in England, through the national Historic Scotland and the Welsh Historic Buildings Consortium, HCE promotes understanding of Britain's heritage, with a particular emphasis on registered buildings, and acts as an adviser to relevant government Departments. The HCE also has its own National Register of Heritage Properties (NRHP), a register of buildings and sites of heritage value. Historic Scotland is responsible for historic property in Scotland.

In Molokai, heavy rain occurred on August 22 from the remnants of Witch and another tropical depression (TC1) that had formed in the South Pacific about 400 nm east-southeast of Tahiti.\nOther tropical systems have developed recently in other areas of the tropics. A storm centered in the north central Atlantic Ocean was identified as Tropical Storm Lenny on August 7, about 200 nm north of Bermuda, off the northeastern coast of the United States and slightly north of the British Virgin Islands. A tropical depression was located near or north of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic over the next 10 days, before moving south on August 10 toward the western Caribbean Sea and then becoming Tropical Storm Zuleta on August 14. A tropical depression was situated in the southwestern Pacific Ocean on August 7 near the western flank of a deep upper-level trough. The depression later became Tropical Storm Daryl on August 11, while moving to the west-northwest and progressing in shallow waters to the northeast. A depression was located in the Atlantic Ocean south of Madagascar on August 16. This system was thought to become Tropical Storm Dannie on September 3, while moving slowly west-southwest into the eastern Indian Ocean. Another depression has been located south of Australia off the western coast on many occasions over the past year, but until recently no action was taken. In late August, another tropical depression south of Cape Torres in northern Australia was determined to be Tropical Storm Marcia, which formed as a result of strong upper-level wind shear and became the first tropical storm of the 2003 season off Australia.\nAt least 29 tropical systems have been named during this year, 11 of which (29 percent) have resulted in tropical cyclone warnings.","token_len":389,"entropy":[7.7588,4.0135,0.719,9.9934,5.1341,0.5859,10.3861,1.6694,1.1147,0.254,0.4943,2.2619,7.2216,3.0446,0.6119,2.5114,7.1628,8.5217,12.5796,9.0536,0.7656,0.1384,1.1917,3.1187,4.3217,3.6526,4.4015,1.5391,6.5287,0.0171,13.3174,5.3775,2.6253,5.9102,5.3559,5.579,0.3438,3.4188,7.1999,6.4648,4.5107,0.3588,3.0958,9.404,0.7645,0.0856,0.5505,6.1309,1.3059,4.4213,0.8647,0.3726,4.0387,1.0906,0.8265,1.001,0.0043,9.5468,5.5476,9.7148,5.9878,5.3523,3.4225,9.3688,4.9179,1.3165,2.1357,2.5113,4.088,1.7724,0.9103,5.0498,0.2468,3.9016,5.021,7.7362,2.7768,2.9252,3.6089,0.0022,0.0552,6.3919,0.1431,0.5177,1.998,13.2539,2.3517,5.8077,3.3414,4.733,4.6057,1.3895,5.2775,2.9188,0.8408,0.8425,6.304,0.0056,1.318,3.7626,5.3481,6.8625,1.2454,0.9953,4.1572,5.288,5.2435,2.5515,3.1653,5.7867,1.7656,4.5188,1.4366,4.9792,8.1402,1.3741,0.5386,4.1034,1.2296,5.8767,4.5027,1.5265,2.1508,1.1688,4.5449,1.4946,6.3445,0.5939,5.2776,0.4747,0.0262,1.6301,0.8226,0.0205,2.4574,6.6835,2.1352,0.4298,1.6064,5.6367,1.169,0.0023,0.4283,2.8566,1.7066,1.9468,1.9615,4.4071,3.0406,7.0012,4.0754,0.202,1.2624,4.4207,1.4177,0.0145,0.7546,5.7909,0.0169,6.481,0.6092,3.1733,3.9373,0.2111,1.2433,5.9096,2.8878,1.9156,3.0555,0.3759,3.0109,5.5553,0.839,4.3829,3.4703,3.2798,2.2784,2.8711,6.4292,3.0529,0.3885,5.5681,9.355,1.0465,0.4454,0.1766,2.4761,0.5238,2.4589,1.3079,0.5588,0.999,6.9127,1.7009,0.3975,4.2048,1.9063,0.6313,1.8515,0.2746,3.5009,3.2307,0.7124,4.4398,6.8812,0.0068,4.5529,6.369,9.3924,2.6585,1.8517,3.737,1.8196,2.3214,3.815,7.8908,3.0218,0.7137,0.565,11.5004,0.5856,0.1279,2.8565,1.0245,4.8706,4.4363,3.5687,0.4085,2.7153,3.7615,2.2047,0.0463,3.0735,6.6117,4.1355,7.3524,1.776,2.7169,0.7008,3.7527,0.6463,1.9849,4.1814,0.7428,0.2994,0.9535,0.1944,4.6782,0.5058,4.8425,0.166,4.9753,0.3843,0.1387,3.8512,1.3673,5.1689,4.775,1.3812,6.5606,0.0484,5.6214,0.4099,0.2519,5.6018,8.0373,0.2217,2.0135,2.3619,0.6701,2.7757,0.7806,5.2677,2.7756,3.5626,1.7015,0.3519,3.4572,0.2886,3.7523,4.1708,0.0344,0.5287,4.7794,3.3134,5.5824,0.5591,2.7141,4.1598,0.151,4.2928,6.0042,0.3245,3.6078,0.442,6.7816,10.4313,1.3411,2.4253,0.1596,0.6772,2.6959,1.5788,1.8054,7.8843,1.524,3.4791,7.4919,0.7256,0.1353,1.1908,3.3847,4.2558,1.1247,0.568,4.2878,0.7874,0.1786,7.7385,0.1118,4.7384,11.7014,3.5465,4.9023,2.1544,0.6789,5.9427,0.3001,1.6682,0.6962,0.0711,7.2444,2.3904,2.3843,1.8259,4.6652,4.5049,0.862,3.0943,0.0011,3.9213,6.2408,0.2334,0.1157,3.5123,3.252,0.0076,1.9511,4.9252,4.006,2.1807,0.7165,1.4423,3.5985,0.5268,8.9022,2.7398,6.134,2.1045,0.4114,1.5479,5.2623,1.9039,5.2758,0.9582,2.8928,0.5889,0.9821,3.904,3.6267,1.8638,2.323,3.0549,6.7665,0.5116,0.4978,4.6148,5.2839,2.7329,0.1094,1.5293,5.0399,0.2603,2.7427,2.5427,1.8191,5.3446,0.7406]}

Though it was produced after the other releases, it featured all the songs from the original games of the series but it did not contain any of the songs of the Rock Band series.\nIn April 2011, Harmonix announced that they were in the process of re-working and extending the series as Rock Band Ultimate, with features such as full song lyrics and full customisation, similar to Guitar Hero World Tour. The remaster released on October 9, 2012 was the first game to use the new technology and hardware, releasing for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and mobile devices, it has been criticised for the lack of support for older controllers, which were only supported by the game for a few weeks. However, more improvements can be made by purchasing new controllers such as the Rumble Pak and Pro Wrist Pack.

The design by the firm of William Strutt Gilbert, Inc. had been proposed to them for a larger purpose. However, Reverend H. A. Lippincott, treasurer of the San Francisco Board of Missions, who had a financial role in the project, saw this as a good opportunity to acquire land and building for a single congregation by purchasing a major parcel of the property for $1. After a competition between Gilbert and Strutt and the firm of George J. E. Pfeiffer and Company, Strutt Gilbert won the design competition and the work began. When the building was completed in 1924, it was declared the largest single congregational church in the United States. It holds approximately 5,000 people in its large nave. When the original building opened its doors, Reverend Lippincott planned to move the congregation into it.\nIn 1929, an earthquake in San Francisco was destructive to the church, but not to life in the community where it stood and its surrounding neighborhood. Many of the houses that were built around it had a new construction of brick to strengthen them. The main floor of the 100 McAllister was converted into a school and a small department store. The congregation bought and renovated this building to use it for a church sanctuary and offices. Reverend Lippincott continued to work there even after retiring from active church ministry. Through the years, several additions have been constructed and changes to the interior have been made. The congregation has maintained and expanded their sanctuary, and the structure still holds an enormous amount of activity.\nThis page contains news relating to various developments with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.","token_len":391,"entropy":[12.0133,0.2271,4.1869,5.9215,8.7981,4.1325,0.0039,9.4772,3.0818,4.9506,3.3442,1.0437,3.7058,8.7091,0.4218,9.3733,5.5238,7.0013,8.1232,3.3209,8.4228,4.7598,2.5872,0.8264,3.7032,8.7651,5.0214,3.9331,0.0012,0.9219,5.2435,0.3785,2.037,10.6858,2.9987,8.7143,2.7174,1.1522,4.1457,0.5065,3.6275,4.9054,1.1347,4.0071,3.5197,5.5076,5.9789,1.7811,6.0908,2.5593,2.854,2.0258,0.0261,0.433,1.4626,5.4488,5.0032,2.6044,4.4144,1.7276,4.2582,7.5642,3.9661,10.7743,1.7258,4.1823,0.5404,4.1925,1.2173,4.6763,2.4762,6.7094,3.6196,2.2877,6.1943,4.8734,1.984,4.0954,0.0628,6.967,6.5861,0.4673,3.8587,0.0192,5.1975,3.6334,2.6143,0.0036,1.0285,8.293,0.3327,0.301,3.2975,0.0773,3.4721,0.0162,8.1052,0.3126,3.9474,1.23,4.6382,5.0252,6.3534,0.1692,0.6731,2.3555,0.2671,5.1796,3.7034,0.6642,1.0698,4.5695,1.2963,0.5885,4.289,2.9768,1.6379,5.8665,3.9959,1.7319,3.815,5.1768,6.4541,3.4654,2.4863,6.2642,2.7391,0.3705,3.1748,2.8879,2.8588,1.1532,2.1605,1.0135,8.6349,2.3199,7.322,2.1198,6.9008,0.5413,1.8115,0.0021,4.284,1.6981,4.2481,0.8806,7.1653,3.8877,0.0533,5.0536,1.7032,5.4586,4.0827,0.3936,0.0006,3.0776,4.8691,0.3146,6.4638,0.0018,2.1927,4.1748,0.7319,4.0443,5.8545,1.1109,2.3508,6.7281,2.3181,0.8954,4.8657,0.8933,2.2404,0.5595,0.6245,0.8906,2.938,0.4298,1.5144,0.842,5.0415,1.1495,2.0023,3.3089,5.5626,0.4261,2.6792,0.7749,0.3032,2.0309,0.0111,0.6998,2.5783,7.5031,4.7233,3.8376,0.1831,0.5139,2.0922,2.8191,1.1273,5.8787,9.0653,2.0838,1.4073,4.8866,0.9796,4.9032,2.1463,2.9814,3.6519,0.2427,2.2485,5.2566,2.546,0.0577,0.0114,0.0013,5.851,0.3517,3.7508,1.3907,2.3356,2.5295,5.2325,1.0604,3.0194,7.0803,3.2753,0.3675,4.9265,4.2014,3.6298,1.927,0.1025,4.2422,7.4961,0.963,0.4369,2.5945,2.0182,2.6467,4.3035,2.9964,8.578,1.5506,0.7022,3.5778,5.9432,1.2064,3.1209,3.7869,3.6703,5.5062,3.8682,0.4259,5.1981,1.4455,0.3867,4.0779,1.9133,1.6486,1.3821,4.3844,1.8005,2.5426,4.8159,5.3485,4.7717,4.4078,2.6715,4.2246,6.0663,1.5379,1.1266,1.5406,5.5601,5.2087,0.7913,0.2527,8.5532,0.2381,0.0189,0.0019,2.4069,4.2164,0.5139,0.3609,4.8547,2.4371,2.0114,4.6548,7.0793,0.1015,1.003,1.1696,5.5246,6.2558,3.0439,1.5578,4.2077,1.0786,2.9321,5.7547,4.0759,1.1621,2.0853,3.2012,9.2377,1.4007,5.3722,0.7294,5.2532,1.0957,0.0016,0.0042,0.0051,4.0572,0.6145,2.1387,5.6232,5.6492,0.4962,8.5775,1.1235,4.4808,4.0877,3.0163,0.8342,6.9998,1.2973,1.7525,0.4965,4.489,6.7057,2.3346,0.2477,5.7433,2.1687,7.4886,1.8897,0.2168,5.4629,1.3157,0.4409,0.0891,0.9535,1.328,4.8674,1.7809,4.9572,4.7008,1.7494,4.0146,5.5187,1.9058,3.0113,1.8517,4.1817,4.9324,2.4521,3.5967,4.6009,1.4169,0.0038,4.7897,1.0164,1.3778,4.6489,4.3587,2.2462,6.2738,5.701,0.0275,5.2751,3.5584,5.8695,1.5595,15.6201,7.4325,2.9841,4.3811,7.3646,8.4544,3.514,5.3032,2.7167,7.4221,0.0174,0.9872]}

To","text":"From the early 1860s whaling declined rapidly with the increasing use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War \u2013 with unfortunate consequences for the island. To cope with the loss of whales, people developed fishing techniques such as trapping and spearing, and raised pigs and chickens. The number of pigs became so large that they spread, and pig farms were soon established near the main villages.\nMany of the islanders still live off farming and fishing today and are known as the Pohnpeian people. They are proud of their traditional customs, language, and arts and have their own Pohnpeian language and a unique folk dance that continues to be performed to this day.\nThe island has a few visitors but also many who prefer to stay away. As the tourist trade grew during the 1990s, tourists have become increasingly frequent, with the majority from nearby countries such as Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Fishing and tourism are still the main sources of income.\nOne of the main places of interest on the island is the old town of Pointe des Poix in Pointe d\u2019Encre, which was built around the 17th-century harbour on the ocean side.

This version was also known as ``Two-star, Gold five-point.''\nAlthough its cost was much higher than that of the four-star with lynch pin, the six-point star with golden lynch pins was used because its higher cost could be offset by its increased airworthiness and survivability.\nAfter 1945, the red star with three or five point stars was issued to pilots flying F-94D Storks in support of the Korean War.\nIn 1954, two gold stars with a golden lynch pin was added. This Air Force version was called ``Two-star, Gold nine-point.'' It was also known as ``Gold nine-point, 2stars'' and `` 2-stars, Gold Five-point.''\nThe version had an additional wedge of gold wire connecting the outer star to the lynch pin, and used three gold stars that were not linked to each other, and one gold six-point star with a golden lynch pin.\nThe last version was the two gold-star version with a golden three-point star and a golden lynch pin. The star could be trimmed in width or height.\nThese stamps were used in various Air Force and Navy Air Corps publications.","token_len":392,"entropy":[8.9989,0.6199,8.6933,2.6839,5.9593,0.3549,8.2301,14.0623,2.3322,10.4564,2.702,1.6418,4.5159,6.6784,0.2872,3.4099,3.0432,5.2319,8.9521,13.319,6.3259,5.6272,10.516,2.5116,1.7746,5.0935,5.8947,6.8881,1.6387,10.4726,3.0988,8.4231,3.0337,2.5405,2.378,6.6411,3.515,7.2042,0.9447,3.7141,12.2872,2.6665,3.9182,2.7271,1.3754,10.9102,6.287,0.3041,4.4102,5.7308,2.9558,4.2954,6.5964,1.2739,4.4199,5.1116,0.0004,2.2657,4.3163,4.6648,4.19,1.6225,3.3258,2.3036,3.0923,7.2267,0.6852,0.1898,2.1869,1.5488,4.8909,4.046,0.0346,0.5933,0.8247,1.4589,1.5185,2.6561,0.1497,1.2693,7.557,0.0082,0.5224,2.7035,0.2931,3.6469,2.935,1.4568,3.4889,0.4442,0.018,0.1078,3.3952,6.2856,1.1991,0.0043,0.3609,0.7137,0.4987,2.1453,7.4744,0.6613,0.0219,0.2935,1.0451,3.154,0.2658,1.3255,3.7372,0.1848,0.0144,0.1611,2.7424,1.9848,1.9554,2.7129,5.2995,4.0974,1.5527,0.0109,3.2633,4.361,0.6028,0.6788,1.3957,2.8955,0.1987,4.3139,0.147,3.4528,7.0152,2.9068,1.1359,1.9859,4.8185,1.1821,1.1898,1.7719,0.2497,0.009,0.0323,8.1904,1.7838,4.4255,3.6192,1.1841,2.9914,3.322,0.0463,2.3788,6.4265,2.9575,4.8309,4.673,3.3726,9.1361,1.1226,0.3071,4.548,0.4713,6.1293,4.8305,5.6997,0.6407,5.055,1.7394,0.751,2.1775,0.1293,0.4047,4.615,0.6615,0.4946,7.07,8.136,0.0146,2.0467,0.529,1.0976,4.0396,0.106,0.0257,0.142,3.8538,2.9425,0.131,0.0007,0.5064,0.7401,3.5709,4.7972,3.5505,6.4529,0.723,4.2854,0.988,1.9668,0.1787,2.1339,3.424,6.5705,1.4961,2.4843,7.6556,0.0015,0.4108,0.4557,4.6239,4.6731,0.1453,0.6927,4.8447,1.8777,1.3184,2.9201,5.6082,3.487,2.8196,0.111,0.4218,6.9179,1.696,3.3596,3.9898,3.9574,0.0822,8.5929,5.9272,7.375,7.8464,3.1235,4.629,0.0305,0.5833,4.1936,0.1939,0.3422,0.9844,1.7017,3.7174,0.1112,4.1802,1.4575,0.2311,2.0563,3.0561,5.154,0.3368,0.0013,0.0612,3.194,1.8898,2.5418,2.4423,10.371,0.0177,0.0729,0.6521,2.3115,0.4656,2.9911,0.1461,0.13,0.2029,0.7383,6.2326,0.6024,0.0673,2.51,3.8459,0.3876,1.7374,1.4626,0.0435,0.1008,3.9998,3.0005,0.3427,0.1005,3.0042,6.56,11.0926,3.045,1.2882,2.7417,5.7287,1.3936,3.7068,0.9329,1.6428,5.8552,0.3201,0.1785,0.1926,0.3983,1.7962,7.5563,5.2779,3.3353,3.0597,9.0536,2.8945,1.297,6.6862,4.5015,0.8149,5.1459,3.8693,1.0358,0.3095,8.0662,0.0183,0.1942,1.8641,1.8881,6.0528,3.4823,2.4782,0.6589,4.8361,0.8857,3.981,6.5564,0.9975,2.735,0.0267,2.2936,2.57,3.1943,1.6484,7.133,0.2832,0.0091,0.0921,2.042,1.6159,2.5158,0.1646,0.0011,0.0222,0.5951,0.595,1.3216,5.8281,2.2955,1.8942,2.8415,4.2811,3.3855,4.7181,1.5232,2.2148,2.0218,1.7121,2.4801,6.8025,0.2528,0.0289,0.1271,2.1472,1.3469,3.1649,1.8759,0.0013,0.0256,0.6237,2.0487,3.8702,5.6724,0.7605,6.1067,3.2795,7.8998,2.5533,3.0636,2.2844,0.7299,5.074,7.7776,0.6394,2.8208,1.8078,4.8549,4.4393,0.0587,3.2864,1.2238,4.44,3.7261,4.8949,1.4229]}

The","text":"`` Guilty `` was originally broadcast on March 15, 2012 in the United States on NBC between 10 : 00 pm and 11 : 00 pm, preceded by Up All Night. The series focuses on two people at opposite ends of a career trajectory, as both are working to earn their way to the top.\nBecoming a successful actor is only one part of Jack\u2019s life, and it requires a life on the outside that provides enough money to take care of his family and himself. Kate starts working as a writer to help manage his finances and the family living expenses.\nJack always wanted a family. When the opportunity arises, he never hesitates to step up. However, things turn ugly the minute he has his first child. He finds himself on the brink of everything, and he cannot afford the mistakes that he feels that he is about to make.\nThe network has made a lot of adjustments in their daily schedules. We can also add that the second season\u2019s premiere has been moved up from its originally expected date, which is not a good sign. The second season of the drama series debuted on NBC on Thanksgiving Day, which was just a few days after the first season, on November 30th.\n\u201c Guilty \u201d can be considered a fresh take on this genre, in particular a drama about a successful father and a talented writer who both care for their families. The two characters have similar aspirations and desires, which make the drama interesting.\nThe network has also planned to end the show after the second season to allow for other projects, such as the pilot for the sixth season of \u201c The Good Fight, \u201d which is set to debut on NBC in a few months.\nNetflix, which in the past has already signed a contract for the production and release of an adaptation of the novel, decided to take on the series in the United States by using this distribution tool to compete against the giants of television networks.","token_len":393,"entropy":[13.8681,11.9891,6.6269,6.4655,6.8913,1.0782,4.1917,3.2445,0.1774,3.688,3.6677,1.1241,2.1132,0.076,2.4592,3.8968,9.4625,3.2752,9.2784,2.5254,4.7408,1.0957,1.0871,1.001,0.2121,0.767,2.9893,9.3662,0.0446,11.9507,5.4279,0.0097,1.831,1.5961,5.1964,8.3097,0.0999,3.2088,4.2733,5.7049,6.5572,0.1751,0.0115,1.8817,7.6684,4.1716,1.6755,4.6241,3.7951,2.2831,4.4905,2.5301,3.8727,1.3558,2.0373,1.7152,0.9961,0.2804,0.9348,3.1131,13.3922,0.5694,0.9225,3.7607,3.0608,1.667,5.4221,2.0832,1.3043,0.0174,7.8367,13.8135,7.3893,1.7108,2.8702,1.5647,1.5622,2.4949,5.2637,1.7367,6.1342,6.0629,0.4667,2.7655,3.9357,6.1507,5.4721,4.3762,0.5054,4.7074,0.6471,0.0056,1.0245,1.0455,1.3636,4.1017,0.3272,11.0759,7.1814,3.2582,1.1754,0.369,5.8541,3.7113,2.0284,5.8373,2.1959,2.3244,1.7724,4.0661,3.9095,6.3918,0.2019,1.4563,2.4658,2.6237,6.3197,3.1371,2.9345,4.5315,1.89,3.5901,2.9641,5.2255,4.8628,0.766,0.5473,5.8949,4.4407,0.0305,0.8269,4.8559,1.7157,1.9276,4.2758,0.0471,5.0448,4.5241,3.6627,7.4449,2.5414,0.5201,3.9609,3.5929,1.9897,1.1491,0.3988,2.3064,3.4493,0.7885,3.5172,0.5102,2.4965,0.0463,8.3308,1.6317,1.3677,1.9328,3.4791,3.647,2.3483,7.9151,1.6692,1.8651,4.6052,4.3572,1.0979,2.4953,3.7475,0.001,0.3358,0.2475,1.5073,2.7272,8.3033,2.6684,3.6762,1.8496,2.933,0.0175,4.4776,2.0735,3.3253,7.0739,1.9507,1.8108,5.1585,3.9911,6.1148,5.2656,2.8144,1.7596,5.8951,0.3462,11.0497,0.602,0.2948,3.4117,2.9733,0.8711,2.7524,2.6944,1.667,2.8909,4.3451,6.4164,2.1507,2.358,2.1434,1.7378,6.3139,2.2581,1.8432,0.9208,0.8062,2.134,3.1681,0.1552,2.4611,1.5026,5.3334,4.6018,6.0313,0.7359,4.3855,1.0179,7.7835,1.3343,0.8013,3.3724,2.2825,4.6717,1.6539,1.1661,0.6928,1.401,0.7844,1.2301,0.6372,3.4252,5.4157,3.1642,3.6044,1.9989,0.7804,1.4215,6.1042,5.6573,8.7787,2.7346,5.6368,5.9414,0.3375,4.8936,1.061,6.9436,3.2459,0.0494,4.9152,3.1118,1.7388,4.4798,4.7705,4.0289,4.8921,2.0135,1.0973,5.0425,4.0863,1.7122,1.5572,5.1428,6.3427,1.7036,2.8226,5.0705,0.9439,0.8405,3.7863,0.9363,1.7361,4.1441,1.7102,2.7141,3.9671,5.4024,1.3559,4.8623,0.5688,3.0074,3.2772,1.95,3.8569,2.7943,1.9587,1.6055,1.8769,5.025,1.2512,1.5415,7.0721,1.6133,6.3309,0.5015,2.957,3.4288,1.059,1.501,0.0794,4.674,2.7326,1.7624,5.0436,3.0852,2.0495,1.1455,0.0056,1.9341,4.6889,1.2864,1.7166,6.4706,0.1865,0.7583,8.9647,0.6001,2.9142,4.0888,4.4366,1.3686,7.607,5.0456,1.7777,1.6133,2.4601,0.6275,3.4991,0.844,2.3263,2.0496,5.2526,1.0028,1.0134,0.4645,0.7934,7.7221,3.7242,2.1416,6.3477,1.4684,0.2584,0.518,6.1362,5.4659,1.9068,2.2763,2.7162,1.2215,4.3231,3.8551,4.2917,0.038,4.7731,3.6865,0.1086,0.9707,1.9627,1.6434,5.6996,0.2332,3.1398,3.2898,0.6816,1.9952,2.1386,1.8418,4.6778,0.0448,3.7576,4.5037,4.4854,6.3718,6.1359,2.5617,7.2364,1.9276,2.2974,7.7266,1.4149,3.4796,6.3018,0.8161]}

He made his major league debut on April 26, 1956, as a pinch-hitter in the 8th inning, replacing the injured Mike Schmidt. Schmidt went on to become one of baseball's most accomplished pitchers. In his debut, Rundgren pitched four outs and gave up 2 hits. After giving up 3 hits in his next three innings on April 30, he finally came off the bench to face the Philadelphia Phillies'Jack Johnson on May 3, 1956. Rundgren recorded the first victory with the Red Sox in their first MLB World Series appearance. He went the entire series unblemished, and finished that year on a career high in wins with a 20-11 record. He was selected from the Phillies by the New York Giants for the 1958 season. While on the Giants, however, he and his teammates fell victim to Jackie Robinson's historic walk to baseball. In 1959, he joined the Cleveland Indians and won the league MVP award. He made another major league debut in 1960 for the Pirates, who he left with 8 wins on the season. He subsequently joined the Atlanta Braves in 1960 and played his last major league game, again with Cleveland, in 1961 as an outfielder. He spent the 1962 season pitching for the Texas Rangers, and was an American League All Star five times. He retired and became the manager of Toronto's minor league affiliate in 1963.

The country's army is out of touch. The army has not changed with the times, and its personnel know very little of modern politics, particularly those in the civil service, '' Kraphawan said in his address to the participants.\nAsked about the continuing military-backed blockade of the southern provinces, Kraphawan said that `` this is a question of power, not principle.

In the season before Nash arrived , the Suns had recorded a 29","text":"Nash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson and Amar'e Stoudemire. In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29\u201338 record by Christmas, having reached the playoffs in their first year of existence. Prior to their second season of existence in 1995\u201396, the Suns decided to use a franchise tag on Nash, reportedly valuing him at roughly $13 million. Following a disappointing performance offensively that season, Nash was traded to the Denver Nuggets in a three\u2013team deal that also included Michael Finley and Marquis Williams.  He hit 15 of his career-best 22 three-pointers in the playoffs, leading to Denver's first National Championship since their 1984\u201385 title run.\nNash's initial season was one of transition and learning. Although the Suns had a new coach in Joe Dumars \u2014 he replaced Paul Westphal following Denver's fourth straight win in the Western Conference Finals \u2014 Nash struggled early. The club lost more than it won by half court, and Dumars was dismissed from the bench early in the season. In the third game of the season, Nash injured his knee. Afterward, Nash sat out games 1 and 2 while recovering from his knee injury; in early November he suffered the same injury during a road game against the Houston Rockets, ending his season early with a knee injury. In addition, a hamstring sidelined him during the second half of the season. However, despite his injuries he became an essential part of Phoenix's frontcourt. In his absence, Phoenix's average net rating went from 111.3 at home to 102.0 at the Suns Arena. After the season, Nash received an NCAA First-Team All-America nomination and averaged 18.6 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game.

{"prompt":"Over a 20 @ - @ year period during the late 20th century , there was an increase in the number of women in the workforce in Canada . This shift increased father participation in","text":"Over a 20 @ - @ year period during the late 20th century, there was an increase in the number of women in the workforce in Canada. This shift increased father participation in child-rearing activities so that they are not the sole providers of children. Although it is unclear what effect the changes in female participation have on father involvement, recent research has provided support that fathers tend to spend more time with their children in the household, in part as a result of these changes in female work participation. This is especially true within traditional, heterosexual households. In families where fathers are non-heterosexual, the literature is quite mixed and no clear pattern is established across the country. The changes in female labour force participation may therefore affect parents ( fathers; mothers ) through different mechanisms. One would expect that traditional families where fathers are non-heterosexual, would be affected more by a change in female labour force participation, resulting in less time spent with children, or more time spent outside the home.\nMothers' labor force participation rates tend to have been more stable in both Canada and the United States, resulting in more consistent levels of parent involvement, particularly within traditional families where mothers are the primary caregiver.\nAs with most research, there are some limitations to this study. The data presented here were collected for a different purpose and the questions asked differed. The sample was small, which is common with Canadian data. Nonetheless, it remains compelling that father involvement has declined in the last several decades. It is important for future research to explore the causes of this decline, so that appropriate public policy can be developed.\nNotes\n\n1\nAlthough recent research has shown that maternal labour force participation is associated with greater father involvement in child care in the home, this is an important variable to include in future research. In addition, parental attitudes to family formation and education were not included in this study as the data were collected separately as part of other research on family life.","token_len":393,"entropy":[3.816,6.1525,11.8325,7.6939,4.0704,5.2394,4.4764,5.0884,1.4158,6.4715,3.9872,0.9798,0.2488,0.8537,3.489,1.2406,2.3388,1.7565,0.191,1.1643,1.0402,0.0347,4.0743,1.6386,1.0075,1.6848,3.3399,4.2268,0.977,2.9112,6.1227,5.4236,10.8675,6.5531,1.6437,3.4139,2.2237,0.7352,0.0002,3.7558,6.6953,0.5886,3.0104,3.3446,3.3922,4.8167,3.1258,4.4595,0.3018,3.2385,1.3571,6.3299,3.1754,0.9354,4.4364,2.0976,2.7218,1.9129,3.5943,1.093,5.4725,1.0852,2.2214,0.4518,4.2332,2.7934,0.8092,5.4303,0.9159,1.7678,4.8899,3.5464,2.5808,2.5077,4.3748,0.0411,4.32,0.5093,0.1473,1.3488,0.4271,0.1645,3.4415,1.2241,4.4763,1.8471,4.2351,2.1313,4.6444,0.2362,1.1155,0.0176,4.1,3.16,1.6952,4.7347,4.6113,2.9039,0.2644,3.1221,2.338,3.6205,0.4705,6.9768,7.0664,4.4787,6.858,1.4943,1.132,2.5068,8.0002,1.5311,1.5313,0.9674,5.905,0.1443,6.8279,0.1702,0.4159,1.8719,10.2314,3.3269,4.0955,2.449,3.5197,5.3451,2.7544,4.8304,1.6792,4.2665,6.0086,1.9358,2.7817,0.5329,2.5558,5.6476,0.4402,3.2712,5.4813,2.8437,0.0214,3.189,3.8792,3.348,5.6095,6.5254,12.9881,7.288,4.4955,5.8576,6.0804,4.1346,1.0161,0.6957,3.4558,5.6677,0.6618,0.8685,7.1868,2.9549,3.8847,0.5625,0.7356,0.9826,0.002,0.0861,0.0043,1.8629,2.8873,2.2038,3.2719,2.3207,0.8691,4.2332,1.3959,0.0621,2.3274,0.9959,0.0368,0.0108,2.3449,6.3992,0.0652,3.5335,3.5164,1.2344,0.2486,1.0867,2.101,3.3729,2.328,0.7359,0.7125,6.0049,1.0304,0.4545,0.626,3.0191,11.1711,0.4607,2.7205,6.015,0.3435,0.0635,4.167,5.6371,0.0248,4.2037,1.7605,4.772,0.9901,2.1027,6.0482,3.681,0.0523,0.4617,0.4156,0.0352,2.077,5.9829,0.0429,2.8992,4.2379,5.3599,0.0343,5.8701,1.5591,2.753,3.9516,4.0199,2.0238,0.9248,2.2527,1.9629,0.765,4.3954,0.6748,2.5502,0.0008,0.7045,3.3945,4.5119,2.8868,3.3233,4.9616,0.6285,1.8426,1.2886,2.0898,1.6663,0.6883,0.9993,0.9023,0.2835,1.629,2.7806,3.4225,0.7234,2.3641,0.5954,3.5544,1.8497,5.5338,4.1381,2.215,3.1475,6.6038,1.989,6.5909,3.2577,1.6451,3.4736,2.3476,2.6663,1.3404,3.3085,2.5054,4.1127,3.5281,6.2241,3.2876,1.5638,4.9699,0.013,1.8596,5.5921,9.389,1.529,4.8806,1.529,2.7424,4.387,1.2307,1.36,2.9828,3.3768,0.0863,1.0187,3.1248,0.6022,2.5351,3.5437,4.7682,0.6099,0.1849,3.0264,1.164,4.5187,0.5084,0.7498,0.5087,1.8144,4.2306,0.3849,6.0841,4.8252,0.5731,1.7494,1.1443,2.1189,1.8518,0.9518,5.4336,1.9541,0.097,0.6925,5.7703,10.2902,5.916,0.5933,0.665,1.7627,0.4646,4.2385,3.3721,0.0399,0.0143,1.749,2.373,0.0077,2.8823,3.4719,0.6114,1.4662,1.0339,3.0986,3.9842,1.4367,1.9244,0.314,2.0559,1.8243,4.1811,3.4106,4.9282,2.0906,5.3859,0.3208,1.2071,0.4131,0.3557,3.2299,2.6748,0.1797,5.7797,5.3337,1.8024,4.019,5.1669,1.3686,5.5883,3.1463,1.7439,4.4734,0.3546,1.5914,0.4645,4.0713,3.1677,2.6531,1.1166,0.5725,4.4683,5.7803,2.6901,0.0007,5.6086,1.3638,3.0747,2.5126,4.9617,0.824]}

We are in a very interesting time in the history of woman s education.","token_len":394,"entropy":[7.2489,4.7372,11.7064,10.8208,0.3108,11.337,9.0009,5.4753,5.1879,5.1948,5.0498,10.834,0.124,3.1015,5.3022,6.7398,3.2455,2.6001,11.2281,5.3175,2.9897,9.1695,7.4891,0.3878,0.0506,3.7684,14.4082,9.2217,9.3152,5.6125,2.8275,1.4891,8.2833,6.62,4.9534,1.05,1.5405,5.3745,5.4104,8.0884,2.7991,2.1141,2.9393,2.1844,1.3975,3.6601,5.7466,2.999,6.6846,1.2295,2.5626,3.3018,4.3003,0.1001,3.3681,1.9396,0.3579,4.5458,0.2407,2.2318,0.0649,3.2188,10.3782,5.2118,4.3471,1.7403,1.3231,6.5298,5.2104,7.7661,2.073,2.1363,3.7892,4.7539,6.9617,1.9646,3.5041,1.6797,0.655,3.0035,9.9837,5.5348,0.9412,5.6447,2.589,3.8759,1.3622,2.1491,5.4677,2.5324,0.9799,2.8326,4.7423,6.3359,3.8914,1.5951,4.5095,6.6928,8.5485,8.7164,1.9166,4.0978,2.1469,1.3825,6.1177,5.6298,3.515,4.342,2.0149,2.6177,2.6946,2.3727,3.9635,2.599,0.2711,2.0541,6.0003,6.3854,5.0461,5.3708,0.9366,1.6055,0.7997,0.7342,6.1982,1.2221,0.5946,0.0897,0.5376,3.0597,0.6628,1.9526,1.438,0.347,6.3161,1.4029,7.1408,4.9872,1.786,6.1258,1.3501,2.8806,3.3907,8.7735,2.1884,6.1348,0.6715,3.9877,1.14,0.9772,1.2118,4.7342,3.4143,5.1889,3.681,1.0523,2.4192,2.584,0.1241,0.3334,4.1922,2.5965,1.7745,1.2652,2.4723,0.0033,0.2177,6.2841,1.7507,1.7699,4.2151,3.1033,5.2425,1.3942,0.7212,2.2832,3.4984,4.2838,0.7029,4.6318,3.1653,3.9908,5.793,0.2665,0.6409,3.1548,3.5457,9.0035,2.5348,3.7785,4.5457,1.8173,5.3205,1.2811,6.2355,5.0705,1.7179,0.5168,6.2827,4.7362,0.9816,1.7407,2.6882,1.7499,2.8458,2.5456,0.6073,2.9415,0.3564,1.6471,0.1196,2.4429,3.4405,7.3835,1.9619,1.3497,2.1724,2.5698,0.101,0.0666,2.0221,1.5787,6.6612,0.9519,1.4682,0.7161,1.7693,0.7434,2.5738,3.5641,1.052,6.2017,2.3287,1.7822,0.8807,4.7041,6.7946,7.0048,2.6283,5.0878,0.0023,1.874,5.8183,0.1603,0.9643,6.9163,1.1178,3.6894,0.006,0.0698,4.4784,0.201,0.0044,0.3112,1.0778,5.4374,3.736,2.7294,1.1413,1.1468,3.3818,4.0394,0.1341,3.4393,3.181,1.5619,0.0079,4.0778,1.1988,1.5007,0.6374,6.4763,6.485,3.5085,2.9166,0.078,4.0149,0.0403,3.9363,0.2372,0.0175,0.2079,0.0223,10.4199,0.0006,14.0911,6.3,3.8577,3.8403,5.5882,0.6953,3.376,2.2561,1.0312,1.744,5.1339,0.043,3.1061,3.0464,3.1194,1.5259,2.1889,2.7749,0.0371,0.0088,3.6386,4.4071,0.4507,5.9653,0.9959,1.7082,1.8623,3.3735,0.2588,0.0706,2.7241,2.3021,6.7317,4.4368,1.8053,1.257,3.5502,1.0315,1.6075,5.4138,2.8042,0.0479,2.862,3.8055,1.2173,7.7554,1.0789,0.4587,0.7623,1.4521,2.0603,4.4732,6.6546,0.0011,4.228,1.3211,2.0862,4.7565,2.2286,7.0092,0.8917,1.8279,1.0556,5.9349,3.3549,4.2534,3.2481,0.1979,0.0496,4.1165,2.7586,5.2859,4.2635,0.3264,4.5958,1.4626,3.3602,3.2903,2.1797,4.627,2.3056,5.588,0.439,2.7781,1.0594,3.2088,2.2786,5.7391,3.1687,5.6327,1.0026,0.7103,1.0794,3.7054,1.9364,3.9883,1.3766,2.5046,4.003,0.7895,1.8007,1.5432,1.4366,0.0045,7.9004,10.3873,3.645,0.6852]}

She had always included songs in her albums for children. With the Philips distribution, she became a music label. On this release, she chose some classical music, as well as pop tracks and some children\u2019s songs. At the same time, she turned down the offers to provide only the voices for her recordings.\nIn the autumn of 1965, she recorded the album Sch\u00f6ne Kinderlieder with conductor Ernst Reiter. In 1968, she continued playing in Germany with the ensemble Heller T\u00e4nzer, and in Austria until 1969. That year she worked with the Vienna Philharmonic with whom she made a series of concerts around the world. In these, she made an appeal to be released by the music labels and to get her own publishing company.\nIn 1969, Simone was on the TV program TV-Studio Hamburg with Stefan Nacht. A year later, the Austrian media received a radio interview conducted by the TV program Sportpalast. Later in that year, the newspaper Die Zeit, the largest general circulation in Germany, covered the release of a CD of the album Sch\u00f6ne Kinderlieder by Simone.\nIn 1971, she returned to performing with the opera S.M.S. Merchant of Venice. In 1973, the same composer, Richard Wagner, arranged some songs for her.\nIn 1974, with her former orchestra Heller T\u00e4nzer, she played in Japan at the International Arts Festival Takikawa. It was her last appearance before her death. She died suddenly in Vienna, Austria, on 9 February 1975.\nHer body was interred three days later on the grounds of the Vienna Central Cemetery. The funeral was held privately and no relatives were permitted to attend. Her husband and sister, Eileen, are buried in Canada, where they lived for many years.","token_len":394,"entropy":[10.682,0.2297,10.6284,8.5446,11.8593,9.6482,2.5204,2.8206,4.3331,7.5196,7.4078,6.5765,1.4192,0.9027,6.234,6.1839,1.9332,2.4328,4.1665,6.1398,3.1067,3.0186,0.3308,0.964,8.93,0.1503,6.7686,4.8159,0.2985,2.4302,3.1214,4.3955,6.5517,4.5188,1.6451,0.5435,1.983,4.5949,5.1825,2.2921,5.7467,1.1909,5.3905,8.1903,1.5199,0.9351,3.7636,1.644,4.9921,5.8424,2.3098,5.0296,4.3923,5.1329,0.4848,0.9588,6.0376,5.6285,5.8972,1.4515,1.8527,4.2113,0.5591,0.0246,5.7379,6.6737,2.8834,4.403,6.014,16.9388,7.4653,3.2691,2.3337,0.5596,4.9525,0.6424,1.2787,0.0045,0.1406,0.6907,5.8164,2.9559,1.5857,7.1083,1.6478,5.4877,5.9469,2.386,7.4595,2.9564,1.5867,2.9487,0.6585,1.7683,6.1669,2.2514,4.7018,0.0302,1.5117,0.0983,1.6404,4.3433,2.3338,3.3621,7.2161,4.175,1.1626,8.7823,6.4865,5.4119,4.035,7.9648,5.3887,4.82,3.7836,1.1144,2.655,3.9194,0.1957,0.8425,5.8644,5.1742,2.4987,4.1667,2.5568,1.3289,8.4789,12.6667,7.4432,4.1373,2.4305,4.333,1.6993,1.9959,1.4967,8.3642,8.2716,3.3729,1.2043,6.1933,0.8245,1.9073,5.018,1.0261,1.981,5.9523,2.4647,0.0011,0.0118,5.0574,5.813,0.0943,5.3485,1.977,2.9566,0.0151,3.2799,5.6549,0.5513,0.7612,0.3879,1.6156,5.876,4.5369,0.2831,3.5333,3.7629,5.8512,0.6273,6.3451,5.3855,2.8548,1.1094,4.8871,3.8096,2.5842,1.9328,3.9158,2.5751,2.3748,6.8926,2.3401,0.7871,1.6376,1.6485,1.9951,0.2284,3.5185,2.3561,4.5194,1.238,8.3488,2.5635,5.6618,3.8968,7.5148,8.1893,2.727,6.1777,5.2515,4.0019,2.3604,4.669,2.9013,0.2625,0.4479,2.9639,6.2942,5.5678,5.7611,1.0095,5.7666,1.7027,6.1647,0.1687,1.9171,4.7347,3.193,9.0511,9.9018,3.6079,0.916,5.334,2.3351,2.9504,0.3387,0.2234,2.3131,5.9475,3.4674,0.8032,4.1922,4.07,4.6002,7.1301,1.3173,3.9663,1.6087,0.1419,4.7554,0.7668,3.4033,0.203,2.9969,3.45,1.7319,1.7906,1.2701,0.8542,0.1058,0.0074,0.2386,0.0168,0.0165,2.3349,1.87,0.6734,1.4426,1.3994,2.922,0.0871,1.5046,3.6966,0.1508,7.4748,1.8399,0.7335,5.5419,5.0184,3.6916,3.7298,0.1612,3.4073,0.1682,11.3778,3.4303,3.6832,1.0167,1.515,2.2985,0.1874,2.5831,4.3267,4.9485,2.3677,5.4935,3.1561,0.148,5.9279,6.4108,4.7861,0.5242,1.454,1.7057,2.648,0.9621,1.3482,0.0919,5.0548,2.8272,6.502,3.5192,15.411,0.0682,0.0096,0.0031,0.0064,0.6273,0.7353,3.0718,1.5504,7.6247,3.7967,0.4287,4.0182,6.9378,0.3291,10.8898,9.1457,1.346,4.3167,0.1933,3.0569,3.3836,3.3365,3.5624,2.9604,2.1403,0.7717,2.5133,2.0879,6.3062,1.2026,6.1505,2.0465,1.9125,1.2128,0.8727,4.4065,2.9216,1.6171,0.2719,0.7119,3.5235,3.5492,0.2038,5.2787,0.0026,8.1374,0.6339,0.4413,2.9524,1.3751,3.8525,0.0851,0.6179,2.7655,6.0388,1.9569,0.6108,2.6498,3.9635,1.2316,0.4831,9.0725,3.0357,5.5713,5.5907,0.683,3.9381,0.3895,1.1683,0.3729,2.9926,4.2159,3.2683,3.4989,1.8326,5.4021,3.3501,0.7018,3.5743,1.6595,0.5799,8.9596,2.3719,2.4648,0.9573,3.0157,1.4409,2.2382,0.0793,0.2618]}

One of the most important archaeological discoveries of recent times has been the excavation of a Neolithic settlement in Ashdod and the discovery of a Neolithic necropolis. Ashdod has been known since ancient times as a port of Israel, as it was a trading and shipping center. Ashod also served as a refuge for Jews in times of persecution.\nIn the 6th century AD, the Roman governor Flavius Iulius Decianus established Ashdod under the city of Amidarya (now Ashdod). In its original form, Ashdod was surrounded by a wall. In the mid- fourth century, Ashdod started developing an Egyptian-Macedonian population. The city became a center of learning under the Byzantine Empire and the medieval Crusaders, who helped to develop the university.\nUnder Mamluk rule, Ashdod was given to Cairo (the capital of Egypt), in exchange for the Egyptian cities of Aleppo, Caesarea and Acre. Upon the fall of Mamluk rule in Egypt, Ashdod was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. The city was destroyed by a tsunami in 1692.\nAshdod has been the seat of the county of Ashdod since 1767, until it became a part of the Kingdom of Israel in 1949.\nThe Ashdod military air base was the first to be established in the Middle East, and is the largest one of its kind outside the US.\nIn 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.9 struck the city of Ashdod in Israel, causing some minor damage. The earthquake followed another strong earthquake in Lebanon on 25 January 2008, with a magnitude of 5.3, which killed more than 200 people.","token_len":394,"entropy":[10.2927,4.895,8.1941,0.5455,0.639,6.1556,0.0084,2.1205,2.0757,3.5597,3.3129,2.9455,3.5834,3.3471,2.694,1.2332,2.9427,5.6904,0.0608,2.8326,2.7457,7.5463,4.641,0.0065,1.671,0.3793,2.5463,3.0685,0.7136,0.8708,6.6162,0.5455,5.6148,4.9092,2.3906,2.1958,4.5925,0.8041,0.527,5.5985,0.8392,0.1974,2.3205,1.7755,3.6986,1.8853,1.1389,5.2118,0.5553,3.9414,0.2639,1.2861,2.5657,0.1637,1.0564,5.7694,0.001,2.02,0.8537,2.9995,0.0269,0.003,4.5555,1.2724,1.8202,0.0764,1.1685,4.5993,0.0006,8.8095,0.0055,1.5298,5.3117,0.0194,0.0017,3.0895,0.8651,3.2181,3.347,3.2667,0.0475,0.6403,1.3329,6.4988,1.404,8.867,1.4063,4.3667,3.3265,1.209,2.4027,4.1682,4.1697,4.1293,2.7074,1.812,4.6201,17.8192,6.3082,6.198,0.0456,1.0436,6.2004,0.5296,2.8235,1.994,5.5687,0.0784,2.2586,1.5173,1.2727,7.7391,1.5966,6.4754,0.1356,0.2686,1.5125,0.4673,1.679,4.0227,3.6031,4.3102,0.2488,4.388,10.3325,0.4249,7.2741,6.0473,1.1249,5.1494,3.7192,0.0185,0.0056,5.4829,0.8262,6.1897,0.9681,10.5639,9.1018,2.9353,3.56,2.7902,0.5621,0.1749,1.6774,2.6676,5.7984,4.8771,0.9647,0.2944,0.5479,0.0042,0.0005,0.4686,4.7347,0.1016,1.6928,3.5043,4.0314,2.5857,0.9666,5.1577,0.4774,9.6875,0.0463,2.4782,4.4337,0.0118,0.0014,6.3246,5.5698,3.687,6.7373,2.8915,6.5401,1.5695,0.0021,4.7127,1.2513,1.7452,2.0667,2.5923,1.2339,1.9309,0.5511,3.6293,7.1284,0.6156,4.9828,1.412,1.5824,2.538,6.4033,6.4013,1.2506,2.5435,1.7577,5.2542,1.4492,3.4281,0.7721,7.1745,2.1454,1.9981,5.8189,8.0879,0.5947,0.1339,4.5647,0.4484,0.6082,0.0057,0.0008,1.5126,4.8666,2.3574,8.0622,3.6711,3.0509,0.7198,0.4076,0.8558,1.473,4.8027,4.342,0.0019,1.464,4.8049,6.316,0.5096,6.2813,1.1985,6.4918,0.0106,0.0078,0.9838,6.6821,0.2173,0.4866,6.3068,1.2799,4.1267,0.0029,2.2541,0.0035,0.001,2.4627,1.6624,5.1922,0.2474,1.5424,0.0052,0.0009,0.9544,5.1834,0.2813,1.0607,2.5882,0.1455,3.1815,2.6416,4.3494,0.4243,1.7991,2.2184,0.9937,4.8485,1.0355,3.6029,7.8793,0.6747,2.2452,4.9987,1.0562,1.411,3.0825,0.0122,0.0017,3.708,0.9242,2.6807,4.5827,0.0265,1.875,10.3607,0.3686,3.5498,0.7198,0.3796,1.2299,2.6525,4.8559,1.1232,3.8405,1.8769,2.8146,1.4258,2.3807,0.0019,0.8199,4.2571,0.0653,1.9376,0.7953,4.3543,0.1937,1.5423,1.9712,4.1678,0.0798,0.0115,7.1306,9.6882,1.6694,1.4022,4.069,2.6561,3.2978,0.8506,3.1346,0.9837,1.384,2.6942,0.0208,1.8056,1.2051,2.8129,2.1199,2.093,6.4089,2.2512,0.6181,0.0586,5.2772,1.4427,4.8582,0.3902,1.5156,2.4804,4.9654,0.2745,3.9976,5.4111,6.3013,1.3467,0.1019,0.3949,2.2055,0.0598,2.2744,1.2033,1.4657,1.6529,0.2115,0.9371,0.0325,0.0105,2.556,2.7744,1.1297,1.487,4.5553,3.4273,0.4508,0.6359,1.568,3.4739,4.926,4.6484,5.0031,0.2447,1.1217,5.6199,2.6399,4.455,2.5864,2.934,1.0657,3.8839,1.7519,0.2927,0.1531,1.416,0.0293,2.0969,1.9675,1.5244,1.7873,2.8267,0.0181,2.6553,0.3255,0.2792]}

{"prompt":"The area soon became a tourist attraction for the early South Australian colonists , and was a popular destination for picnickers . In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that `` Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque","text":"The area soon became a tourist attraction for the early South Australian colonists, and was a popular destination for picnickers. In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that `` Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque spot in South Australia. On the right the waters break over the rocks in huge spray, whilst on the left a broad, picturesque valley, and its rocky foot-hills are dotted with scattered huts. \"\nIn the later 20th century, the tourist industry expanded in the region, and the waterfalls became popular with swimming enthusiasts. The waterfall is a popular feature on numerous state and national waterfall maps, as a result of the numerous photographs taken from its various locations.\n\nDescription\n\nBoth Waterfall Gully and the nearby Lake Lonsdale are heavily wooded and bushland, with relatively few features visible from the road. This may explain why at least one of the maps that included this area did not include the Waterfall Gully location, which sits in a cleared area. The gully is mostly dry, although there are waterfalls, streams and waterbodies. The waterfall is visible from the road, although it is not in the immediate vicinity, being several kilometres away from the road that runs along the western boundary of its catchment. The top of the fall is about one metre above the surrounding foliage, which makes the landscape relatively accessible from any vantage point.\nThe gully begins in the undulating hills to the north. The waterfall is formed by a series of cascades which tumble through a gorge, before cascading through a narrow valley. The waterfall itself flows in a relatively straight line, ending in a meandering pool adjacent to Lake Lonsdale. The waterfall's catchment area measures approximately 12 square kilometres. The waterfall is visible from a number of different vantage points. Its location and exposure on a large sandstone ridge, and adjacent to a small but beautiful lake, has made it an iconic tourist attraction.","token_len":395,"entropy":[7.5637,8.4752,1.0184,1.0063,3.473,0.9429,2.4738,2.2388,6.4172,7.7999,7.422,6.5604,1.3625,1.7072,2.8467,2.6062,2.3652,1.3549,0.2103,9.9008,4.3975,0.001,1.9613,2.9368,1.4143,4.4765,8.4153,6.8545,4.3885,2.1483,10.7369,13.9954,3.7294,6.7051,3.0809,1.8254,1.7367,2.0148,5.4874,0.0026,3.5799,0.7132,2.5239,0.1144,1.7791,4.8304,0.974,4.1718,3.6592,5.649,7.18,3.7378,1.2397,4.802,3.8313,6.2153,9.2409,3.3399,6.7676,0.8589,0.0088,0.2201,2.926,5.7156,3.1174,8.5625,0.0003,3.2885,3.0752,3.9408,4.2728,5.7753,7.1775,3.0015,5.0228,0.1079,1.5988,3.1373,0.1122,6.2512,5.5365,0.303,2.4585,7.6829,2.8275,4.4896,2.1209,5.7738,3.9502,0.0129,0.152,1.4301,1.4235,7.1756,2.8658,2.5858,2.831,1.4266,3.9563,0.8863,1.2759,1.8831,5.2157,1.7514,1.5569,2.3827,2.3273,7.5338,2.4825,0.755,2.1023,5.271,2.7754,2.6734,2.2997,5.0312,2.192,5.7176,6.122,1.1631,1.4239,9.2232,2.523,1.0767,2.56,5.5149,4.0334,0.5038,1.1315,5.0786,5.5591,1.8691,3.68,2.7335,4.6112,2.2209,0.4638,1.3869,3.6045,7.3269,1.0998,0.0002,7.7494,6.4333,0.0641,0.1003,0.0023,0.1284,1.4344,4.0427,4.1846,5.1912,5.1384,0.0317,1.0143,6.4902,3.0966,0.014,1.3855,9.0835,1.8008,2.6628,1.3049,6.0833,2.4829,5.546,3.9015,1.6412,0.4563,4.2408,0.6126,4.0291,5.1224,2.564,0.7527,5.9991,1.7514,1.0483,1.3739,0.1397,6.8127,4.2773,5.9261,2.6369,1.2676,4.7792,0.0195,0.7362,1.3137,4.7313,0.017,0.105,0.0024,4.9196,2.3929,2.3581,7.2457,2.6037,1.5367,9.0322,1.2319,1.9217,1.8749,7.9621,0.0516,1.2495,5.1434,5.2383,1.2513,4.1197,2.2818,0.6386,4.6754,0.147,2.9135,3.4563,0.6901,4.0631,8.1513,0.0917,1.9269,1.4718,3.8737,1.0508,5.1891,0.7439,0.8782,0.9738,1.235,3.3076,1.5405,0.5609,1.5781,4.4134,1.1061,5.7518,0.1687,3.726,5.8117,7.0439,2.2952,1.4755,0.7862,0.3779,2.2447,6.114,3.8523,1.5759,0.3078,4.895,3.33,0.2753,6.9207,9.0548,0.03,0.6267,1.6342,5.7103,1.551,0.1643,7.1384,0.938,2.9659,3.986,1.4759,2.1987,0.7697,6.0278,6.0154,1.0022,2.3775,3.6234,1.9903,6.3219,4.9542,5.7477,2.6798,3.5401,2.5465,0.0271,0.1829,1.1612,15.6522,3.9491,0.0085,5.9566,2.1731,0.9343,9.8559,0.4283,3.6342,4.5717,0.5884,1.7447,2.6569,1.4294,4.3309,1.4113,5.0652,0.6559,1.2771,1.509,0.0029,3.8316,0.2928,3.2767,7.6457,3.5286,1.838,6.1926,2.084,4.7914,4.1382,0.1094,3.2828,0.9159,3.7204,1.9462,1.5191,0.9384,2.671,4.5265,4.1896,3.1696,1.106,5.2561,2.9316,0.3937,1.1427,5.8234,1.2192,0.3834,6.917,0.349,6.9902,7.3001,0.0377,5.1571,0.4586,0.0027,0.0003,0.453,1.0266,2.2519,3.059,9.0209,0.0406,3.0964,7.2025,2.2796,3.8241,3.4717,0.1756,1.6504,1.3008,1.793,1.23,4.6541,0.3159,2.7349,3.6849,0.0006,3.4819,0.527,0.0091,1.5841,5.5198,2.2097,3.52,8.3101,5.0092,3.2013,4.3033,9.1745,1.3639,5.0023,2.7731,2.7345,6.7621,1.6078,3.2989,2.8012,6.0688,4.2031,2.3803,0.8983,4.1419,2.7925,0.4448,1.6248,4.6621,4.1719,0.5242,0.6447]}

The'Hound - Dog'Flag, used by the Virginia Insurgents after June 20, 1863, reflected a'Hound - Pup's'attitude toward his master.\nThe'Hound - Dog'Flag, used by the Western Virginia Insurgents, was created after the separation of the colony from Virginia, as'west'is spelled in'Virginia '. The name of the state and the'Virginia'in the name of the colony are both misspelled. This flag has been used to show both political support for the Confederacy, and support for Confederate sympathizers and sympathetic people of'West Virginia ', which are not a distinct entity in the world outside of America.\nThe original Hound-dog-flag was small, but it is thought that a large version used for rallying purposes was drawn and used repeatedly over the years to show loyalty to the Confederacy. A small version is displayed at Confederate Memorial Day in Virginia.\nBy the 1880s, the'Hound - Dog'Flag was being used around Western Virginia to show support of Confederate causes, as it was still the case in the 1890s. The Flag - waving confederates shown in the photograph were, in reality, civilians waving the Confederate Flag to show support for the Confederate cause.\nThe first printed photo showing the'Hound - Dog'flag in use was taken in 1909. The photo shows a civil war veteran waving a flag from the first - western Virginia issue that had a smaller flag on top, but that is the size of the Confederate flag.\nThis photo was taken while in Virginia in 1909, and the flag was one that had a smaller white'Virginia'on the left - hand side of the flag, but not on the'Hound - Dog'itself.","token_len":395,"entropy":[2.7671,9.0662,2.0439,1.6297,7.4875,0.6713,3.88,5.1361,2.3794,3.2032,0.1818,6.8586,0.0911,8.4047,14.4035,7.8221,3.2382,5.4374,6.1516,3.2257,7.181,0.8504,7.3489,9.0909,4.3435,2.2329,3.8502,1.4744,0.5727,0.3549,1.5386,2.2492,3.6421,0.6531,2.8977,12.3604,6.5805,5.6442,6.5404,8.8375,2.5882,5.8265,4.1102,6.1559,1.0933,1.5129,4.3797,7.2838,2.1429,1.0005,5.7693,6.2543,0.4748,0.328,0.2625,1.1058,9.1465,3.5697,11.3567,2.3573,0.1234,1.8757,6.033,2.6327,4.4852,2.7347,9.5626,0.8403,2.5807,5.2816,4.9926,1.6356,3.0994,6.0784,6.0844,0.5357,0.1019,0.576,1.0558,0.2677,0.4889,2.1246,0.7259,0.0202,0.066,6.6623,0.6651,1.2661,0.0015,0.111,4.0353,1.3679,2.3041,3.0133,0.9587,6.232,0.3814,1.125,6.9062,0.9397,0.5239,3.1665,3.6929,10.5855,11.3939,6.4975,6.9803,8.7038,2.6147,6.4413,3.1272,8.5306,1.7373,4.9368,1.4559,0.3293,4.5559,4.7534,1.2392,4.9859,5.5396,1.7183,5.5781,2.4051,3.3801,0.3576,0.7446,4.2418,2.5613,3.4116,5.823,0.4933,1.4051,3.8528,0.9502,3.6108,0.7725,1.5432,3.0548,3.0498,5.1548,7.0113,3.7619,0.7128,0.7923,2.2286,2.4916,0.3708,3.224,0.2512,4.3981,5.0062,0.4763,3.0107,7.3199,4.2533,2.7782,7.0077,4.4096,0.3826,8.125,2.9833,3.1265,3.7505,4.3076,4.4596,3.9969,2.0399,0.8699,3.794,4.6835,0.3726,3.9711,0.609,0.9811,1.354,5.2872,13.3481,3.3588,3.3191,3.0252,0.7775,0.7054,9.6595,1.1306,2.8639,2.1988,3.1234,4.7786,1.2602,4.2401,2.3174,4.367,6.0844,2.1827,6.8407,3.9886,1.5441,7.0667,4.6669,2.3331,7.2758,3.9082,0.4557,0.6244,2.1929,2.4432,4.7318,0.2609,0.4461,1.3298,0.5852,3.975,2.9658,0.9426,2.9407,5.4154,1.9215,6.1212,2.2209,3.9411,1.6196,3.7803,1.6008,0.9127,5.5003,1.2579,4.4787,0.4613,0.295,0.996,5.9073,0.2155,0.0218,1.0328,0.1926,0.1052,0.3779,0.6308,3.0314,0.6341,4.6284,5.8543,0.1815,2.4415,1.3265,0.9657,4.0975,3.0279,4.9932,1.7063,2.4704,3.1539,0.8688,5.1703,3.3762,5.503,1.3165,1.2506,5.4385,0.1128,0.6616,1.7407,4.4599,5.2501,11.3292,9.594,0.0036,1.0579,8.8439,1.5199,1.2816,5.0358,4.5631,4.8855,1.7844,3.6139,0.0253,7.0441,7.2621,2.8911,2.6586,2.729,2.8907,0.8996,1.1825,0.3234,0.7531,2.4809,0.0267,0.318,0.9841,1.268,4.1375,6.7012,4.7986,4.3538,0.7063,4.8968,0.1281,0.0184,0.3539,0.0149,0.0879,3.8067,2.3639,5.5908,1.1977,0.9329,0.7542,5.3779,1.351,1.2548,3.369,2.0199,1.3217,7.7831,0.5175,1.9398,3.609,1.8558,1.7841,4.0582,1.0716,6.0573,8.0328,7.0929,1.4326,8.2667,6.1292,3.8718,3.3623,7.2901,2.3979,2.8018,2.4898,2.2077,2.6643,4.0615,3.8628,2.4442,6.0042,0.3612,0.8958,4.299,0.8018,0.8353,1.277,3.7624,1.8826,1.1179,0.456,4.8406,4.5036,4.5456,2.5301,3.168,1.4124,1.3941,2.3885,1.429,1.0008,5.6316,3.8779,1.5296,1.6352,1.0573,6.0466,9.5775,9.9475,0.6457,4.5226,1.342,2.722,4.3112,6.5754,1.8963,1.0577,0.177,1.2195,1.9778,2.6708,3.7992,1.7626,0.1941,7.2051,2.3783,0.0193,0.2587,0.0839,0.2042,10.1449,4.0824,0.3237]}

When we first looked at Earth-sized planets close to their star, those exoplanetary systems were called'super Earths', because they were larger than the Earth. As the technology changed, and the number of confirmed planets. In fact, if you know where to look and how to use a telescopes, you can find them. Using simple telescopes, amateur astrophiles can also enjoy observing the planets, but not at night, of course. This article will show you the best places, which will surely catch your attention, in order to discover and observe Earth-like planets. Aim to see. In 2018, NASA published the latest exoplanet catalog containing over 10,000 confirmed exoplanets. The catalog has been updated each year for more than a decade. It was created by the Kepler team using observations taken from the space telescope. They also had to go one step further and make a new catalog \u2014 the first to use data collected using the new facilities. The list includes exoplanets in orbits between two and six times that of Earth. These are. The search for Earth-size exoplanets is at fever pitch. For two years, Kepler has unearthed numerous planets that are a bit larger and larger than Earth, but not enough to match the definition of a planet. One reason is.\nHow to Find an Exoplanet Using the Kepler Surveys. To find an exoplanet using the Kepler surveys, you\u2019ll need to set up a telescope, or buy a telescope if you don\u2019t already have one. You\u2019ll then be able to scan a specific part of the sky for exoplanets every night for the next 24 months.","token_len":395,"entropy":[9.3573,9.7618,5.961,7.2764,6.5255,8.1182,5.9014,4.9638,1.36,0.9794,1.3303,4.1288,2.2867,5.3962,5.1068,1.3361,0.3534,0.825,3.9394,0.0144,4.2991,0.4527,8.9783,0.3091,1.8953,0.1962,0.796,4.0573,6.5083,2.5988,3.6487,3.5183,8.9885,4.4023,5.8033,0.0568,3.6164,0.7479,10.8143,0.3362,1.7298,0.0005,0.0862,0.5191,1.805,14.6241,0.0001,7.0671,4.5438,4.0437,4.0538,3.4917,4.043,5.9261,3.4435,6.9416,3.7214,2.5763,4.1268,0.4421,3.77,0.9435,4.075,0.5125,7.2829,0.2466,3.3837,0.7268,0.5137,6.0322,5.7315,0.0058,5.864,2.2186,0.8291,4.079,9.9516,17.0819,5.6505,1.7317,10.5498,3.2992,0.8653,0.7851,5.3829,0.5237,1.533,2.0115,1.4767,4.204,2.0144,8.1766,4.1894,0.3947,3.7456,1.6765,2.7102,0.051,7.3399,1.6074,8.2012,3.3085,3.3991,0.1278,4.9402,1.1528,5.1642,2.5674,1.5051,0.0332,3.6348,2.2976,0.5842,3.7778,3.0246,7.5761,0.6165,0.5189,1.2837,2.4022,2.0476,1.7596,6.7325,7.1744,3.0192,0.8566,7.7616,7.1451,8.3706,1.1831,4.3284,7.5608,2.9213,1.9615,1.7904,3.0784,3.4132,3.7488,4.0758,4.3257,2.1074,6.7304,3.8496,0.3542,3.6602,3.4771,1.3548,1.8164,0.123,2.714,2.2658,3.03,4.1216,4.3238,2.277,7.6612,6.4395,1.261,2.5994,2.0612,3.3538,2.3964,0.4177,3.1958,3.7319,3.3529,4.0763,0.4355,1.6421,0.3127,1.0351,9.9728,1.6643,3.0856,5.5087,4.6175,7.9149,0.5278,3.2321,6.4071,1.7895,4.4216,7.1446,0.0115,0.1871,2.8614,6.8553,2.9507,3.9162,0.4694,0.1729,4.5991,1.4782,0.0026,0.1298,0.6792,2.2043,2.6321,3.026,1.1196,0.8126,5.2462,0.362,2.8092,3.9977,0.3779,2.7469,0.5639,0.8663,3.4142,3.3885,2.382,1.1177,1.5884,0.7172,2.2069,4.3528,4.6957,3.5147,1.6505,1.2354,4.9567,0.9701,2.8626,4.3741,3.4494,5.2777,1.3641,4.6943,7.9587,0.0888,0.0526,1.8329,3.9668,1.9765,2.721,2.2452,7.8987,2.337,4.427,2.4503,3.4693,3.2038,2.682,5.0177,1.4898,3.3037,7.1056,0.5787,1.9149,5.3865,3.2784,4.8579,0.0219,0.3221,3.2583,4.3817,3.396,4.5895,2.4492,2.8731,0.6772,3.6211,0.3173,0.654,0.9975,3.4247,1.4449,7.8814,2.1693,4.8253,0.7829,1.1065,0.2041,2.8611,2.8785,0.0047,0.0416,1.5707,5.3049,8.3807,0.0418,0.8469,4.2772,5.3864,1.0821,0.9261,1.7526,1.2429,9.8662,6.0479,2.4551,2.0554,1.2304,5.0888,2.5143,2.4717,3.2031,3.3437,0.1516,0.994,1.5987,1.6534,2.6971,5.8649,0.2884,3.9507,1.5786,7.2148,0.1768,1.2823,1.1547,0.5642,4.6517,5.3925,1.1417,6.3172,3.8686,4.2302,1.2812,2.3557,4.0323,1.0729,0.0009,0.0056,4.7624,1.6782,0.6013,8.6867,0.0156,1.3826,3.9429,1.1101,0.8047,0.2517,0.0003,0.0039,2.3586,0.4637,0.1301,2.3545,0.3849,0.7492,18.8548,7.8461,3.7035,0.8768,0.4806,5.887,0.3108,0.8302,1.1445,2.2973,3.3433,4.8992,0.5489,0.6029,6.8795,0.1453,1.4081,2.9232,0.2638,0.3909,1.5194,0.2421,0.0834,0.268,2.6061,2.0126,0.0361,0.0329,4.2268,4.1224,0.4301,0.0079,5.8758,2.5168,5.4562,2.9389,0.038,0.2344,0.8466,2.2102,2.6862,0.0044,0.1711,7.6671,3.1555,3.0739,2.1165,1.3904,2.8036,4.8031,0.5508]}

He had to lose some weight and his body needed some time to get back the normal figure. A common rule followed by actors and other workers of films, shoot schedules are not always in sync with the nutrition timings.\nWhile he had to work on the schedule, Shruti and he were staying in a hotel in the capital on a regular basis, where they also had their family members with them. That caused Shruti to spend a long period of time away from him.\nKannada film fans had already given Shruti the label Shruti Samson for Vikram's previous films like Sarkar - Kaarel Lokasya Mahisummanah and Sarkar - Sathyanidhi Seetharama Kalyana.

In","text":"The English variety of plum cake also exists on the European mainland, although `` plum cake `` there more usually refers to baked cakes made with fresh, rather than dried fruit. In the United Kingdom, however, plum cakes are usually made from dried plum flavoured with sugar. Sometimes, the recipe makes use of a mix of dried and fresh fruit.\nPineapple Jam. Pineapple is one of those fruits that is always in season, and is available as a fresh fruit in the early spring throughout New Zealand, as well as in a pickled state until the end of summer.\nThis tart is a traditional New Zealand recipe using a local variety of the apple which can only be found in New Zealand, the McIntosh.\nAs well as being a delicious fruit, the McIntosh apple, is also believed to be anti-carcinogenic. It was named in honour of Charles Macintosh, 9th Lord Falkland, a British politician, writer, and explorer. His surname derives from `` Falklands`` - the island group on which it is also named.\nThis is one of those recipes that can be easily adapted to suit the ingredients you are using at the time.\nIt works well with a variety of cheeses and this recipe makes use of a combination of white and wholemeal bread.\nThe addition of ricotta is quite common in traditional Italian cooking, although other cheeses such as mozzarella make for interesting variations.\nThis is a delicious dish that really shows the versatility of the apple in both shape and size.\nIn Italy, apple crisp is one very popular dessert. For the past few years, apple crisp has gained quite a bit of popularity in America, although it is still a fairly traditional dessert in Britain, and in New Zealand - so try to incorporate this into your list of apple recipes.\nTo make this recipe, first cut the apples into chunks, and then mash them to turn them into a smooth puree.","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.0377,9.3143,1.7863,9.1821,6.9873,5.0823,4.5359,3.7349,1.2133,4.6246,3.3748,1.1577,2.8722,16.8905,9.0764,0.3589,3.7807,8.5464,8.7236,4.6001,2.0419,0.0386,6.0793,1.5914,1.6067,1.3801,5.1866,2.6504,5.3209,0.1961,1.636,1.957,0.6806,2.7247,1.7095,1.4765,2.3278,0.3285,3.6106,0.0017,3.4432,1.1499,0.5533,2.9201,1.0972,2.3659,2.1605,4.3843,7.9672,0.2747,2.0363,3.0376,1.4965,6.4138,1.5882,1.9061,4.4595,5.5478,0.9283,0.0078,2.2175,4.0585,0.0483,1.4831,1.1286,1.094,1.1665,1.1649,1.759,9.7267,2.3066,5.5119,7.71,4.1421,7.3999,0.0643,2.0721,3.0692,0.0393,3.8589,3.1963,0.6955,1.4496,4.4401,3.521,2.4627,1.4579,1.6274,1.7739,5.4959,2.4828,0.4321,4.7567,2.0258,1.792,1.9505,5.0779,1.8088,7.1604,5.2124,0.8292,2.0837,3.5799,0.3172,0.0083,0.7012,3.9221,7.8282,0.7916,5.5901,6.1221,1.4261,2.2934,0.0031,3.4483,0.3031,2.34,5.6049,5.5349,1.5192,2.2826,3.7503,2.9485,0.0804,4.933,6.0932,2.1804,6.801,3.9593,0.2654,3.7514,4.5215,5.4366,3.9505,4.156,0.0484,1.2335,0.3184,2.4348,0.0454,1.942,3.9623,11.6175,0.3126,2.7104,1.9407,5.2033,2.9083,0.0376,1.376,1.0523,3.9013,2.6847,0.3394,1.8146,4.6655,0.0005,5.0303,4.427,4.9733,0.7996,6.0941,0.03,0.8318,9.732,0.0771,5.0346,1.7751,0.0055,0.1635,1.1344,2.0282,3.5727,4.9656,4.1111,1.0707,0.0042,6.6166,7.1031,0.5284,10.8474,0.6708,6.1559,11.1504,1.0514,0.9379,3.5816,3.4794,3.8448,2.0172,5.8877,0.8094,0.9283,3.9579,1.0071,4.766,6.5607,2.8147,0.0264,7.5809,11.5313,4.2644,3.677,3.3949,1.388,3.1767,7.4474,3.962,0.3806,4.0757,0.9064,6.3317,3.833,0.3975,0.8364,3.3299,2.4525,2.3496,0.1097,2.8066,3.0236,0.9264,3.4491,0.464,3.4869,1.6366,0.6497,3.8379,1.9989,7.5818,3.0259,1.9213,2.203,4.8826,1.6177,0.7743,0.9076,1.3867,4.4137,7.062,2.084,1.5209,2.1379,1.972,0.0089,6.1565,0.0107,1.5182,6.616,2.9226,3.7706,1.9756,0.0052,1.9691,3.0501,0.0225,5.4058,1.213,6.4742,3.5163,2.8709,1.1428,1.0435,2.6351,5.857,0.0077,8.0833,0.0254,2.904,5.0357,2.5585,0.854,5.1012,5.2854,2.4868,0.9366,3.1554,4.8311,4.2921,0.0026,2.4145,0.0016,4.9144,0.046,0.0025,5.7322,4.6106,4.8497,2.5703,0.4974,0.6278,2.6759,1.281,1.1046,4.2819,4.3623,1.4881,6.2966,6.2037,1.9671,2.8832,0.338,1.1655,5.4981,2.7774,5.6217,7.5788,0.0327,3.6262,0.2058,0.7558,4.0207,6.1512,0.3508,3.6636,7.812,0.7525,3.4104,7.9962,0.5159,1.8848,1.6272,5.088,2.3953,4.3101,1.009,0.4047,0.2598,2.5335,1.4935,0.2212,4.4287,4.479,0.2384,1.6184,0.055,0.1651,1.2127,4.464,1.0586,3.2205,1.3045,0.8411,2.1432,2.7243,2.776,4.3864,0.9142,1.5991,4.9671,2.4343,1.7568,3.0589,2.6521,0.0431,5.5542,4.7367,6.7825,1.6444,5.6771,2.1949,1.5966,0.1203,6.451,0.9732,6.0698,3.0283,0.4436,0.2888,4.6318,1.2257,1.3242,2.3539,0.4236,3.4385,3.3437,1.0821,1.5236,0.9177,3.8384,1.3831,1.4625,1.0301,5.2023,0.8318,3.1763,6.7752,0.682,0.1145,1.2655,2.8827,7.6177,0.036,0.251]}

Aang explains he plans to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin is gone, but Zuko argues that he will not do it until his aunt tells him where to find him, before Aang convinces Zuko to start doing something positive for Aang's sake instead of attacking each other. This does no deter Zuko from continuing to threaten Aang, even as he tries to show his appreciation by inviting him and the Sokka family dinner. Zuko has a moment to show them Aang's art but then immediately attacks them once again ; he even starts to threaten Toph but Aang stops him and says that they must learn to work together.\nBefore Aang gets into the house, he asks Zuko to leave Toph alone because Aang is her son, a point that Aang only gets to acknowledge when Aang asks him about it later, and Zuko immediately attacks him again, this time threatening to destroy the firebending school and claim it for himself. He says he is not ready and demands that the Fire Lord grant his wish, as Aang's teachers have told him many times before. Aang is stunned and is confused, as Zuko never wanted the School of Firebending before, only after he started to understand how dangerous the Fire Lord wants it to become.\nZuko then rushes into the room to confront Aang, before Aang finally gets his courage and rushes in himself, throwing many of the food into Zuko and then taking it back.

Unlike many of Tennyson's other important poems, `` Ulysses, '' written only eight years earlier, received little publicity at the time. It was not long before others, however, noticed its unique power. Even Tennyson himself was impressed, writing on the occasion of its publication that : \\\" I am inclined to say that the world should be made aware of its very great merit\\\" (quoted in William Wordsworth's Biographical Dictionary).\n\\\" If he, by a great effort of genius, should succeed in forming a single poem like `` Ulysses, `` such a poem as can be composed in one sitting, I should say he should make it public.\\\" \\\" Ulysses '' is a magnificent and wonderful poem and a wonderful poem for the age of the poet.\nTennyson's most famous poem, `` Leaves of Grass, '' was written for the journal The Friend while residing in Italy in May 1855. It was published in 1859 as the third volume of Poems. By this time Tennyson had been living in Italy for several years.\nH.G. Wells, an English writer and pacifist, was heavily influenced by Tennyson in his writings. In a letter written when he was in Russia, he states that \\\" Tennyson has been my inspiration for several volumes that I have written. \\\"\\\" A Modern Prometheus \\\" was one of several works that Wells wrote on the Russian Revolution, and it mentions Tennyson.\n\\\" I have been reading `` Leaves of Grass \\\" with unparalleled pleasure for the last week, and can hardly think of anything else to compare it with. \\\" However, the influence of Tennyson upon Wells was not only literary ; Wells himself was greatly influenced by his lifelong friend, who taught him to observe nature's laws and to respect those of his fellow-man.","token_len":396,"entropy":[9.6754,9.1445,1.7999,10.1916,3.1494,7.0605,2.6528,2.9773,4.3379,1.0533,2.7473,2.4636,0.7421,1.4564,1.6056,0.2747,2.0963,3.0754,1.3528,4.1041,3.0678,4.6007,4.3736,1.5822,5.0511,0.0796,1.1861,7.6945,3.1993,1.0337,7.8147,0.0001,0.0022,1.7394,7.1335,1.2543,0.1303,12.1374,13.439,1.0194,0.0004,3.6682,4.6632,5.9979,4.6154,5.5325,0.6728,1.8221,0.2486,6.8633,2.9254,3.2637,3.9964,0.5553,0.0637,0.6704,2.5196,0.6718,2.6203,3.3949,0.4016,6.3107,2.8761,4.2257,0.0047,4.5741,2.9252,6.3602,2.4923,1.1677,6.215,2.911,0.0002,1.0878,2.1101,2.5742,2.5914,2.1433,2.98,2.1615,2.8454,0.6278,4.3091,0.5223,2.3954,8.6397,9.0341,2.1802,1.92,6.3475,0.0865,2.6556,0.6048,1.8369,5.7821,4.2879,1.5102,3.6525,4.7081,0.3374,2.9703,4.9185,4.1736,5.545,6.8942,2.1811,4.3804,0.1617,0.3824,4.6339,6.1913,0.0309,1.992,6.8072,2.5887,0.6148,2.8871,2.562,13.4998,6.1138,5.157,5.3637,4.7814,4.0095,4.0073,3.5875,1.6021,2.6935,0.3019,3.9054,3.0158,0.2647,5.9211,0.9359,4.9078,3.5927,5.848,4.6165,0.5702,0.0003,0.0006,0.3574,4.4881,7.0889,2.0313,2.1944,3.2832,5.3859,0.8961,3.5628,1.7279,3.0153,3.217,0.9437,3.6194,3.7352,2.993,3.4506,2.5729,3.3469,1.434,5.7678,1.485,6.8978,8.4538,6.5806,0.0044,0.0015,6.8852,1.6021,1.9581,5.3101,2.8953,5.1249,1.0601,3.7414,2.391,3.9955,2.1106,3.4073,1.7816,4.8217,1.7224,1.6031,3.2069,0.4454,2.7369,3.5253,0.0004,0.9887,3.7932,1.1116,0.8104,1.428,1.4189,9.1155,0.8537,0.2178,1.4606,2.2848,1.1213,2.4412,3.8605,0.9173,7.9649,3.8153,8.3608,8.4787,6.9152,0.4578,6.1329,2.2265,5.2185,0.6133,4.8331,0.2482,1.5938,0.9169,1.9843,0.821,1.7651,3.293,2.7717,2.3785,3.6789,1.035,0.2505,5.9768,0.2374,1.2403,5.0699,2.0308,0.0603,2.1991,0.0009,0.8248,2.3297,3.1877,0.4226,2.8106,0.8687,3.0814,0.1475,1.6392,3.2712,5.9069,2.6118,3.2622,0.0505,0.8417,1.3456,3.6128,1.5926,2.8307,1.3412,8.5809,0.0035,0.4391,2.0313,9.0962,0.606,0.0833,0.1862,0.0014,3.287,0.4961,3.1286,0.7659,2.4275,3.4302,1.1015,2.2858,6.3093,0.8186,0.2379,2.0981,5.9518,1.5387,1.1446,3.9474,0.8276,7.8349,2.9891,0.0039,2.754,2.1426,4.1193,3.9489,1.3472,4.3401,6.4826,5.0007,1.265,0.673,1.4377,1.8423,2.5259,9.893,4.8346,9.9708,6.709,9.8747,2.5119,4.6738,0.134,4.8832,2.6229,2.0267,2.2859,0.998,3.0232,2.1262,5.008,3.3574,2.1211,1.7992,3.1431,9.0378,0.4738,0.0007,2.0783,1.8012,6.3109,2.7928,1.734,2.0641,3.4591,7.1816,2.0643,0.007,0.0017,5.1569,4.4562,9.5278,2.7355,2.7556,1.719,0.5784,6.0037,1.6466,0.5847,5.0521,3.6962,3.074,0.2719,1.908,2.4861,2.3774,5.4786,0.6712,0.3276,0.8151,2.9097,6.2733,0.244,2.9414,6.3592,0.5035,0.5505,0.0015,3.2259,3.577,2.1339,2.6656,2.9844,7.715,6.2029,8.8878,3.0637,1.3551,5.0074,0.1128,0.1607,3.6359,8.098,2.0111,1.7278,3.9174,5.2628,0.3476,1.8575,8.156,6.543,3.8087,0.7646,1.3121,1.6026,4.6878,4.4283,2.0273,2.5646,2.0761,0.7919,3.0576,0.3516]}

In order to make the financing and construction of Phase 2 viable, a short section of the waterway was made open access in August 2010\nBrigadier Gordon Stewart, MP, MSP, Chief Commissioner (National Cycle Network) and Chair, (Cycling UK) joined the T&C Team as a special guest at our inaugural cycling campaign rally yesterday to launch the campaign.\nI\u2019d like to welcome you all to our cycling campaign rally tomorrow. As you know, this is the second national cycle campaign rally we have held. It has been really well received. We do have over 700 volunteers from cyclists, from environmental, transport and economic groups, and lots more. In our first campaign rally, we had more than 5,000 supporters and participants. We have seen momentum grow over the past few weeks and, as we have planned, we are going to take advantage of all of this.\nIt\u2019s not going to be about us asking for money or for subsidies. I know that to be a problem. It\u2019s not going to be about calling for big money or big projects. What we need to do within this campaign is to really encourage people to get on their cycle in the first place.

In literature , gods may appear","text":"Although the Egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear within the dreams of the human soul. In antiquity, it was believed that even such gods as Apollo or Hermes could speak to mortals via dreams. The Egyptians believed that the only people who knew how to interpret dreams were the priests who also served as spiritual leaders.\nDuring the Middle Ages, dreams became part of the teachings of many ancient religions, most notably Christianity and Islam. The Catholic Church taught that dreams were a communication from God that the human soul required to be fulfilled and transformed.\nThe influence of dreams remained within many societies until the 19th century, mostly relegated to religious literature. During the 19th and 20th century, though, the development of Freud's psychoanalysis began to change the way society viewed dreams.\nFischer von Erlach, a 19th-century German physician, was the first to link the function of dreams to psychology. He suggested a correlation between dreams and sexual arousal. Sigmund Freud developed psychoanalysis, a system of psychology that became based on dreams. In the 1930s, Freud changed the interpretation of his own dreams, making them appear more mundane, everyday occurrences. In some dreams, Freud revealed his sexuality that was repressed during his stay in Vienna, the site of the First World War. Freud taught his followers to seek meaning in dreams, but did not discuss the connection between the content of dreams and the physical experiences of the body.\nFreud believed that dreams were a form of regression, a term he first coined to describe the normal and natural way of which the self regresses into the earlier stages of development. In short, dreams contain all traces of our unconscious psyche. This regression would not be restricted to the waking state, but rather manifest in dreams as well. Freud believed that the content of dreams came from both the conscious and subconscious mind.","token_len":398,"entropy":[2.311,10.0395,5.0938,3.8731,3.0982,2.7966,0.3564,7.2176,1.1234,0.9976,3.1762,3.8793,0.0269,0.2775,9.3754,2.3993,1.3177,4.325,1.607,2.8109,1.9744,1.067,6.7597,1.7362,0.1141,5.7381,6.2466,0.7769,2.5623,10.465,0.5529,4.0422,4.561,3.5184,5.2992,1.5438,5.8116,0.3966,2.1888,2.2763,4.5612,2.5598,1.5037,5.9266,0.2385,3.8877,0.2372,1.1074,0.1324,5.617,5.2945,1.3411,2.696,3.758,2.8375,4.0882,2.7458,5.366,1.3929,3.038,3.2686,1.9913,0.6985,2.4134,3.1649,1.0602,0.4692,1.6234,5.2692,4.7135,0.6621,2.8803,2.4594,0.1498,4.8706,1.5741,0.5229,1.318,4.6388,2.1697,5.6943,5.5437,0.576,4.3209,4.5945,0.5754,1.4272,11.0985,0.2957,2.2131,0.0516,0.2342,5.6978,2.5852,3.6546,0.0162,1.2923,7.5996,0.08,3.8839,2.9418,1.1207,1.37,4.3148,0.3506,2.3203,1.5902,1.2067,0.1953,1.9467,6.5673,0.1638,4.2021,0.2263,1.6924,0.9505,2.3335,7.3356,3.6207,0.363,3.7059,4.4204,1.6889,0.9199,7.1288,1.0387,2.6861,4.3226,3.2192,7.2014,1.4795,2.5784,2.0482,6.137,0.0637,1.0808,6.7389,5.8243,3.839,4.4281,3.3512,0.3494,2.9925,0.0031,0.0869,0.957,7.6169,8.9445,0.0466,3.4431,5.1372,0.6343,4.1004,0.6606,1.8635,0.0097,3.3896,0.4287,0.0016,2.7084,0.1302,5.9685,0.1132,1.444,6.0724,0.0403,6.753,2.3959,3.0732,0.0407,3.1032,0.3755,3.2734,0.717,1.2355,4.1703,0.7359,1.3874,0.3489,2.7252,3.6836,7.0115,10.7427,5.1271,3.2325,4.3015,2.2621,1.4732,5.3437,0.0032,1.3039,0.0162,1.1648,4.0506,0.6705,2.8309,2.3088,0.2494,0.5868,6.7335,1.442,8.3588,0.0889,0.2939,0.7346,6.581,0.6365,1.292,4.1387,4.4837,5.485,0.0603,1.7557,0.0741,6.0828,2.116,0.9164,7.69,0.9753,0.0,0.0014,4.1333,3.4714,0.0091,2.7447,2.0691,3.872,0.8381,4.8224,0.9951,5.4977,6.0604,0.2164,4.1077,0.9254,2.9286,1.9276,3.0473,0.1295,0.1844,1.3412,5.7488,1.368,5.6103,0.0377,3.4584,2.9885,2.6672,2.245,3.9034,0.51,4.6138,1.6653,6.1732,2.1433,8.589,2.6673,0.5614,2.4743,4.5822,4.881,0.2271,1.1276,6.0696,2.6867,4.9452,7.0169,1.6156,7.8957,0.1413,3.4327,2.2697,5.6023,0.6464,4.153,1.5516,3.9613,6.0672,0.1748,1.1646,5.0824,0.7441,0.0012,0.244,1.4239,6.3813,2.9974,2.6256,1.8118,4.8969,4.9862,0.8496,2.3423,1.3809,3.0203,4.4731,0.1444,4.9723,1.7336,4.9612,0.1939,1.9199,7.3765,0.1801,0.819,0.0383,2.0431,3.3371,4.6453,1.3785,1.3414,3.634,0.2947,1.127,3.3534,0.0022,3.0739,0.2011,1.7624,0.9528,2.0156,1.9488,0.0064,8.4678,1.4332,1.4205,5.6612,2.4505,5.5473,1.0974,1.6205,0.1662,1.052,6.2603,3.171,4.2642,4.7082,1.2019,9.4507,1.7858,6.1309,8.1621,0.3739,4.1313,2.1334,8.8103,1.8633,0.0416,2.5251,0.4868,2.5033,5.459,0.0063,0.8409,6.9377,4.797,6.8211,0.0147,4.2404,3.3603,4.9226,1.2441,3.7683,7.1347,5.1033,3.2052,1.3465,6.2737,0.1064,1.3421,3.1003,2.1796,1.0529,0.8315,4.2635,7.4583,1.5845,3.4327,2.0204,1.1856,0.2246,1.6242,1.5889,0.1208,1.615,6.2368,0.0687,0.2506,6.4563,0.5276,5.1065,0.9771,3.5081,0.425,1.4756,1.8543,0.5966]}

Richard took a close interest in developing the town of Lydford, creating an impressive new town house and courtyard with a clock tower in the new court from 1255.\nThe castle continued to remain part of the Cornish nobility's estates and during the early 16th century had been in the possession of the Sir John Manners and his family who were prominent in Cornwall's legal and political life for many decades. The castle passed through several owners from the Manners family, until the property was occupied by the Cornwall Corporation in 1685.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the castle was demolished by Joseph Hall, a Cornish politician, to make the Lydford station of the South Western Railway.\nThe Lydford Castle and Old Parish Church became the property of the Cornwall and Truro Libraries for a small donation from the estate of Sir Andrew Richards in 1927. The old parish church, which had been used as a church of convenience until the construction of Lydford Grammar School in 1892, was then converted into a book library which, however, could only hold a very limited number of books and soon became inadequate.\nThe Lydford Castle was then acquired by the Cornwall and Truro Libraries from the estate in 1927 and opened to the public as the Library in 1933.\nThe Old Parish Church was reused as a music room for a while and in 1953 it became a museum which currently contains an impressive collection of 18th and 19th century drawings, paintings and furniture.\nThe house in West Park that once stood on the site of Lydford Castle was used as a farm until 1973 and is now the property of Cornwall Council. Its gardens have been developed as public gardens and contain a number of well-preserved 19th century buildings.\nThe historic buildings at Lydford are now protected as Grade 1 listed buildings.","token_len":398,"entropy":[3.037,7.5615,6.7459,3.9466,3.8402,1.6399,0.6531,5.0367,4.7807,0.0438,7.1077,4.812,4.8853,2.3722,1.3036,4.2709,4.1024,4.3547,1.5977,6.0698,0.0833,5.2838,1.2414,5.8157,3.9475,3.6397,6.6014,1.3062,0.0302,9.0725,1.219,4.2357,3.0494,1.0247,0.0297,0.0066,1.5113,7.4161,2.6849,3.4374,4.1319,3.0407,4.6205,2.0535,7.9218,3.8569,1.461,8.4432,0.1738,3.3423,0.6286,7.2447,6.9872,7.1616,1.3418,4.1656,1.1542,1.842,5.8586,2.4083,6.0336,0.2251,4.9645,5.0922,0.0048,0.6524,7.0789,0.0273,4.7547,7.6024,4.2019,3.1879,5.3154,0.921,3.7633,2.8542,0.0963,0.138,5.0435,2.5543,4.9636,1.3503,1.5278,0.0238,1.0755,6.8205,2.863,5.0581,5.4381,2.6743,2.3139,1.8776,4.0764,2.2168,5.9398,0.9433,4.266,2.2221,6.4623,1.8378,1.3912,1.4922,4.489,1.4322,2.7341,0.3108,2.2071,0.8299,6.5918,1.6372,1.9884,4.731,3.4671,1.2901,6.6451,0.0263,0.7929,1.7599,6.1611,1.4829,7.7662,0.589,6.1152,0.2547,1.1235,6.073,6.707,0.8685,1.1516,4.2873,0.4362,1.1603,5.0006,0.5977,3.1212,0.0037,0.3158,3.5822,0.0127,0.0557,1.441,0.4803,0.8002,4.7276,2.0994,8.2127,6.592,1.311,2.1462,5.9738,0.002,3.6736,1.9999,3.0813,1.644,7.9233,6.4029,0.041,0.0152,8.5686,4.827,0.887,6.4594,6.7795,1.8496,1.5198,2.1099,1.496,2.5866,0.0068,0.0036,1.434,4.0754,6.766,7.5821,2.1322,5.3247,1.4196,4.4161,0.0494,0.6329,2.8948,4.6276,9.1086,0.0596,9.136,3.8311,3.1316,4.5905,6.5425,1.7944,0.6744,5.2409,1.0554,3.5106,5.5898,7.8516,2.6358,6.6018,0.3097,1.4134,5.1328,0.9353,0.2134,2.8369,1.381,1.9468,0.4232,2.6479,1.0111,0.3228,2.9197,3.8092,8.5377,3.5247,0.8943,5.3662,0.0308,3.333,0.0245,0.0061,10.7673,0.0118,0.8873,0.4845,2.3421,4.0668,0.1868,0.6135,5.2286,1.9955,0.3446,0.484,6.388,4.2251,3.6282,4.399,5.4307,0.0318,5.5887,2.5051,2.7693,1.991,4.1099,0.7148,0.3163,0.011,0.8155,2.743,8.0906,1.3512,6.1245,1.1277,0.9393,1.1649,1.903,0.0048,0.0022,1.1652,1.1926,4.1676,4.4011,0.1428,0.7944,2.6786,2.428,0.1798,0.0021,0.6592,3.6983,0.5319,1.7835,6.4625,3.8222,1.9184,4.634,1.5374,0.1534,0.0365,3.3123,1.3264,6.4647,3.7507,6.4738,0.1686,1.0936,1.071,5.3613,0.1325,0.1226,1.1774,9.2107,1.4752,0.7658,8.0254,3.7613,3.0021,2.7548,6.2577,1.7109,2.8104,4.6546,1.9679,2.4036,1.8508,3.5394,3.5073,5.7448,3.3033,4.0346,2.8302,0.7811,0.028,5.4879,2.2386,1.4808,0.1,0.002,0.1409,9.1984,1.6607,2.3153,0.5927,6.3717,0.6304,0.7365,0.9154,5.8866,3.7806,7.6428,7.0332,5.5345,3.8243,2.4126,1.1431,0.6333,1.6888,0.4519,2.0519,0.0029,0.0015,0.2185,1.4068,4.0108,0.9373,0.416,6.0089,6.2369,6.2232,2.653,2.3092,0.8169,2.3838,2.6124,0.025,4.7841,4.9702,0.7448,5.1704,5.5985,2.123,0.5515,4.752,3.281,6.232,1.5128,1.2321,8.4333,2.1404,2.152,0.0004,5.5746,0.8894,0.4249,0.0004,7.7262,0.0016,0.556,4.0011,1.2451,0.7299,1.0392,5.7332,4.2059,2.7241,0.8559,0.0023,0.001,4.0095,3.0558,5.7362,3.5996,7.9016,2.6041,4.7199,1.5025,1.6919]}

While the changes caused some controversy and uncertainty regarding tyre management strategies, they were well received both by teams as well as the public, since the safety of the drivers was considered a primary concern for both the teams and organisers alike. Nevertheless, despite the tyres being used for the first time this season they failed to satisfy the teams and drivers as well. While the qualifying tyres were not suitable for use in the race, being too soft for maximum grip and too hard for traction, the race tyres exhibited the same limitations. The F1 organisers and teams' teams decided in the end to use the race tyres regardless despite being at the end of their expected lifespan. Following criticism and speculation, the race tyres were subsequently replaced with a set of tyres with similar characteristics. The new tyres were called Superblandos.\n\nDrivers\n\nIn addition to the two official championship-winning teams, twenty-eight teams raced for the Spanish Grand Prix. The races for the European Formula One championship were contested in single-elimination fashion with four races to be contested. At the end of the four races, two teams are left with a point which represents their respective constructors' best finish (win or podium) for points purposes. The teams with the most points in their constructors' championship are invited to the Grand Prix of Spain.\n\nQualifying\n\nA full grid of 36 cars was prepared for the races. Fifteen cars were entered by teams that competed in the Spanish Grand Prix with their F2010 chassis and tyres. Twelve cars were entered by teams that did not participate in the 2008 European Formula One Championship as they were racing with their Brawn GP and Honda F1 Racing cars.

Their 1992 album Scrolls of the < unk > garnered the band some attention from the heavy metal press, with Metal Hammer publishing a favorable review.\nOn their 1992 debut album, Scrolls of the < unk >, Mortification show their influences in a number of places, from early death metal (Dead Lord, Necromantus) to grindcore (Dead Kennedys, Obituary) and old school black metal (N\u00e9cronicide, Niflheim). They show their musical diversity, though, on their second two albums. On Necropsician they adopted a gory approach to their music and to death metal in general. On their most recent release, Satanic Satanic World Death Metal (2003), Mortification take a harder direction than any other album, abandoning the gothic\/black metal approach of their past for a classic death metal feel that is reminiscent of classic death metal bands of the mid 1990s such as Demigod, Exodus, Death and Agalloch.\nIn 2003, Mortification and the band's singer were sued by the late Stephen King due to the band's music resembling one of King's novels. After the original lawsuit was found to predate the original book by over 50 years, both parties reached a settlement in 2006.\nDeath Metal and Christian Death metal has many aspects of the Christian faith, such as an image and worship of angels, the Lord resurrected and the cruciform shape. Also a prominent influence has been the Bible's description of the final state for the wicked, from Hell to Hades and back and then to torment.\nIn 2004 the band wrote an adaptation of the book by Thomas Crimp entitled Death Metal : The Way and the Reason, to accompany their 2003 release, Satanic Satanic World Death Metal. The book was released in July 2004 by Dyschronic Records, an imprint under the Dyschronic Group.","token_len":398,"entropy":[9.3967,0.2411,1.9101,6.4471,8.359,9.7746,5.9488,7.0514,0.9484,0.4924,9.6619,3.5151,7.8002,9.2227,6.0203,1.3172,1.9108,2.7686,6.98,1.2135,13.9296,1.4334,1.8881,12.3669,10.4443,5.7994,4.6999,9.5605,2.4995,4.1247,4.2176,2.9005,2.4332,1.6351,7.5645,0.2301,3.1784,1.06,2.9177,5.2948,1.8671,6.0149,1.1267,8.0402,0.0671,1.3284,2.1643,10.1053,3.1281,5.6568,1.3209,0.8822,0.8202,3.6722,0.3937,0.0222,0.1282,0.1452,0.0043,0.1622,0.7677,3.0393,0.1013,8.3045,2.7127,6.5244,2.1928,1.7141,3.4143,0.0029,5.2287,1.1407,2.4741,5.4332,3.966,0.0247,3.7572,8.5031,7.2783,2.5167,6.504,2.4113,4.7687,3.193,1.2304,0.2101,7.6084,0.1931,0.5693,4.1915,7.2813,0.0703,0.0005,0.7394,7.1548,5.6574,0.3123,2.9889,1.4974,6.4472,0.8267,5.6038,0.0669,0.2152,5.0004,9.0765,4.9025,6.462,9.8232,1.5847,5.3155,7.8712,1.1039,1.0505,0.831,2.9476,6.3688,2.0606,3.8275,6.0514,2.6088,4.7782,0.8173,5.498,1.4707,2.4989,6.3427,1.1029,2.2821,2.5645,5.8308,5.0547,6.2397,9.9443,5.6891,8.8753,1.2961,7.8577,4.856,3.3542,0.3238,2.1862,1.4972,3.0984,7.3467,4.4342,0.1282,3.4422,2.0825,0.8823,2.3145,2.2639,6.0303,0.085,2.9966,0.2188,9.9918,9.0269,7.1799,6.2729,1.0813,2.0253,4.4596,0.2337,0.9774,0.0892,4.0987,1.3181,5.7771,7.389,3.6494,4.2855,0.6814,5.2377,2.37,7.2566,1.2041,4.3738,4.8006,0.1098,3.7283,3.9221,0.1935,2.893,2.2585,0.7839,3.5952,7.7892,0.7776,8.3925,2.7618,0.0261,4.4701,3.1081,2.2834,3.6631,0.0293,5.5618,1.2737,0.065,3.4111,3.5952,0.2473,3.3741,3.7169,0.3113,3.8324,0.0024,7.0943,3.2988,0.581,1.5327,7.8038,0.9031,4.2565,4.5525,7.3995,6.9609,0.0548,1.3371,1.0183,2.7976,3.6606,0.3545,0.5229,0.0431,5.3965,2.2562,2.069,3.1137,7.5082,5.1298,6.3319,0.38,1.6569,5.2282,5.7452,4.6802,7.6814,0.0138,2.1299,1.772,0.2444,3.7341,9.0724,6.3068,0.2595,3.691,0.0142,4.5994,0.6404,3.6304,1.8543,5.2151,0.7267,0.3567,6.921,1.1944,11.1965,0.0684,1.0734,4.4976,4.8189,2.6729,3.1752,4.4129,0.0507,0.1596,5.6506,2.9054,3.9683,0.6872,0.2732,2.0635,2.8627,0.9421,2.1652,4.3205,0.9179,3.3013,6.5101,1.5866,5.2411,5.1994,5.1247,5.0684,2.029,1.9605,3.9012,4.4871,0.9823,2.9401,0.0053,4.56,7.1611,3.8183,4.1496,0.3599,4.7682,1.2337,2.5655,5.112,8.7373,3.149,1.4167,8.5583,7.1105,5.4955,2.8534,5.3835,4.4067,5.7416,4.0126,4.8101,0.0635,0.7676,5.5891,1.7142,4.9921,0.0431,1.2317,6.5245,5.6203,4.8064,1.2374,5.7226,1.653,5.3244,6.7558,0.9231,3.4472,2.4479,2.1717,5.1855,7.1349,2.5235,8.7132,1.0337,1.9636,2.563,3.764,3.6486,1.0799,5.2422,2.3083,6.6619,0.0442,0.9381,3.0526,4.135,5.1845,11.8972,3.9429,5.6096,2.6462,1.2247,5.7683,1.4801,5.3593,4.7469,1.0877,5.6297,2.6691,4.4814,3.6824,0.8679,4.2544,1.9328,1.8554,4.6648,0.7555,0.0234,0.0607,0.0075,1.1258,1.3489,1.3522,1.6711,2.4382,0.8354,4.3258,2.5059,3.1588,9.5196,5.4554,3.3227,2.4206,1.6727,3.5378,0.3932,7.0164,0.7484,11.9404,0.1943,0.0025,3.1689,0.902]}

Amongst those who followed him into death were the Emperors who had assisted his suicid@on in B 6 6. The murderers left the city without stopping. The city was left in a terrible state. Some days after the Emperor had died: it was still dark when Cnaeus Nero was found, along with a number of his generals, murdered and dismembered. Not one of them, says Livy, \" had been guilty of any act of any kind \". \" Among their bodies, \" says Livy, \" \" were the legs, arms, and bodies taken off of him by these traitors. The bones of one of them were found in the streets of the city, on which a man was lying dead, with the head cut off and the body pierced through with arrows made out of the bones of the murdered man. \"\nIn addition to those who were killed, a great number of others, including the sons of Nero, were murdered along with those who belonged to the circle of the family who had supported the Emperors. Even more were injured who were either executed or sent to prison on account of their family being a direct support of Nero.\nB 6 6\nWhen Nero had ended one dynasty and begun another, he still had no thought for the future. By the end of 6 6 B, he was already planning to marry his cousin, the daughter of Vespasian, to the only son of Domitian, a grandson of Domitian. It is a story long known. Some are of it, others say that Vespasian himself was the one who asked Nero to find a marriage partner for Domitian while they were still alive, so that he might marry his daughter to him and then be the Emperor together.\n( )","token_len":399,"entropy":[7.5329,3.1005,12.7086,2.1592,9.6672,2.976,4.7693,6.5111,1.4998,7.4296,2.3223,1.4903,6.8375,1.0157,10.3291,6.1908,0.8684,3.7023,6.0249,2.5905,1.5318,11.2655,13.0118,8.6586,4.4407,6.7448,3.2183,7.3355,5.8253,0.6245,2.9046,0.0203,0.659,10.6883,1.775,1.484,7.8527,1.8,3.2818,0.9922,3.598,2.2126,6.0075,3.4238,1.5534,1.4963,6.4027,0.0809,4.774,1.7479,7.7866,3.5303,8.6075,3.978,0.3472,15.0665,7.6984,6.4208,8.6085,9.7119,7.0634,2.5651,2.701,10.0459,5.9208,2.2757,2.6846,4.8953,6.0122,1.3365,2.4062,4.4289,0.8265,5.1831,2.2138,3.1291,5.2676,0.3137,1.1678,4.5678,4.6738,1.4656,1.8571,4.3102,2.8784,1.5991,6.4286,5.8403,0.5568,4.2547,3.2549,3.8316,6.6196,6.6265,2.0846,4.5884,2.3268,4.1683,3.2676,6.4686,0.0272,2.8816,2.3883,0.003,2.0097,3.6124,1.1279,6.0915,2.9172,4.9782,0.5847,0.0002,0.6238,6.3095,2.4313,0.75,1.1602,3.3321,7.7702,6.5275,0.6392,0.4075,3.508,6.7221,2.1709,7.2174,0.2311,1.3739,4.8216,0.6055,4.8227,0.7948,6.2453,4.6433,6.5949,6.7224,2.9326,2.871,5.3884,8.0674,0.8276,0.0025,0.3628,1.1475,5.8012,0.8672,2.3875,7.5114,1.7807,1.8019,0.5012,1.401,5.9853,7.4412,4.1615,3.847,1.6518,1.7149,6.6291,5.7096,0.0078,2.0316,2.3745,5.6081,1.3406,4.4023,0.7416,1.027,1.2761,2.0225,1.5374,0.8051,4.2035,1.1368,1.1561,0.5933,1.5687,3.5879,2.406,3.6268,3.4755,1.5087,2.5456,2.1942,1.7699,2.7862,1.7248,2.2324,4.0259,0.1172,2.2176,1.3599,1.9667,7.2873,3.3834,1.3341,5.3104,6.2435,2.7105,0.0812,2.462,2.7279,0.5491,1.2324,6.7071,1.4588,1.2679,2.4382,3.4081,5.8038,4.78,0.4364,4.1431,1.2697,1.6531,1.5913,0.8842,3.7634,3.064,0.3273,0.3189,2.2183,2.2793,1.6415,1.4969,5.513,0.0809,2.0998,0.7734,1.071,3.6357,4.364,0.0802,3.5158,1.7829,4.7546,0.0222,0.493,10.3367,0.4269,1.3114,5.7051,3.4964,1.6367,5.5205,1.6834,4.4098,0.0063,0.9487,6.0367,3.2797,3.0803,4.9732,6.0272,0.9087,5.1407,3.4847,0.3732,4.0523,0.3644,2.2909,4.6266,1.8822,0.0054,0.5003,5.5791,3.9269,4.441,5.7678,5.1499,1.447,2.0322,0.617,1.9311,5.3793,6.3216,1.1874,3.9197,4.6994,1.8305,3.1977,6.4062,7.3242,7.8386,2.367,5.2976,1.266,0.5053,1.3389,5.9489,1.3748,4.8574,6.78,2.8025,0.9594,0.4755,0.5984,5.314,1.3477,2.4263,0.0294,3.7092,3.4958,7.0595,4.6962,1.4139,1.561,3.2486,5.2296,1.0969,5.9652,2.5235,3.6814,1.772,2.6819,1.9732,0.0698,5.5702,0.987,0.0042,0.008,0.8705,2.9258,1.801,6.2768,2.2622,0.2538,5.1319,0.0443,0.0637,1.2706,2.7854,5.3633,0.0761,3.1079,0.0195,0.1164,1.3714,3.9527,1.6779,3.676,3.691,6.2896,3.9378,2.6104,4.6447,5.5323,3.8934,6.125,1.7847,1.6807,4.1221,1.5225,3.9885,0.0059,0.0018,0.0144,4.8629,1.5103,3.0313,1.8207,0.4277,5.8358,1.5743,0.5524,6.5306,1.4999,3.7955,4.1709,1.7311,4.7716,0.0063,0.005,6.4412,3.7311,0.1789,1.8024,1.6357,2.15,3.8042,0.6217,1.425,0.9067,2.6308,1.8418,2.7758,2.2781,1.9897,2.982,3.7155,3.8312,3.2735,4.5488,7.2604,0.8064,1.7481,5.3974,7.2723]}
