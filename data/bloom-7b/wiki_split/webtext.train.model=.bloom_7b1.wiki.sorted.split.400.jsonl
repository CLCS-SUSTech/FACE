Each day, the player may visit the town's bar to see some of the town's residents and talk to them. The player also gains access to some items which, when used, increase the characters' abilities beyond the levels of their default abilities. With each day ending, the player can choose which conversation to begin the following day, or any other event that is available at that time, such as working on projects or buying items. Once the end of the game has been reached, a message will appear as usual, stating the number of hours and day the game has ended as well as the day and hours the game ends for the player. Once the game ends for the player, the final message will appear, stating \".\" when the game was a successful ending, or stating \"?\" as a failure. The Final Message also shows the day and hour the game ends, as well as the total score that was gathered by the player.\nDuring the game, the player may talk to some townspeople while they are having a drink in a nearby bar. If the player doesn't have money to pay for a drink, the town's bartender may offer the player a drink for free instead, in exchange for being accepted into his life. The player may then talk to them about his life or what he's having for breakfast. Conversations, such as these, may happen after the game had begun or at the end of the game.\nWhile the player will not have to follow the storyline of The Last Day together, the final game may end in the same way as before. The Final Message will say whether the game was a successful ending or not, as well as the day in which the game ends, the hour it ends, and the score achieved at that time.","token_len":400,"entropy":[5.5648,1.5666,5.3472,9.9473,0.4911,1.9087,5.6097,7.397,0.6699,10.9114,4.3553,7.1952,1.7682,4.8691,4.904,0.2674,9.1307,0.0345,2.0972,7.8558,0.1558,2.1154,4.2759,4.1314,3.8961,3.7151,3.2763,8.1185,2.4545,10.4973,1.6788,3.7825,0.0327,3.3107,0.0043,1.0751,0.9549,5.569,1.0906,6.5203,1.3271,0.8042,7.0753,4.1463,0.8594,1.7316,1.9707,5.4751,4.3471,1.4781,6.1098,2.8639,5.2865,2.0247,3.158,4.4282,0.9704,0.6362,4.0014,0.069,4.5733,2.6749,4.0993,1.6356,1.6851,2.3441,2.3439,1.1093,2.9569,4.5989,1.0106,0.0128,3.043,4.5518,4.3217,3.9667,1.64,1.7429,0.8005,4.1992,0.7316,7.0911,0.2566,3.1177,7.4732,2.101,6.7326,1.1898,2.5532,5.3097,3.3275,0.3231,5.9055,1.5024,2.315,6.0708,0.661,0.5397,0.188,1.943,3.0731,2.6283,9.1274,2.4552,4.4945,5.0483,4.9911,0.2068,1.561,2.1674,4.3502,1.6271,5.07,1.889,3.0676,3.3461,2.7228,2.1071,0.5494,2.871,3.0988,0.0016,7.3831,1.6566,6.7158,1.1029,4.6713,2.2362,0.6924,4.6943,0.7313,5.933,0.3784,0.5712,1.9736,1.5695,0.9244,2.6336,0.0536,3.3538,3.8117,0.7293,0.418,5.6685,5.7445,2.0874,2.2762,2.0355,5.7334,0.0696,2.9834,3.3831,4.6537,3.2167,2.7053,1.1207,2.1407,6.0102,0.7986,0.018,0.831,3.1366,2.8599,5.4194,2.7405,1.8905,3.4676,3.9668,1.3078,0.5717,0.7716,4.0893,0.4762,1.6586,2.0741,3.3769,0.4962,0.1862,0.1516,0.8986,5.8805,1.7185,0.4088,1.3214,1.5837,0.7601,4.16,11.9512,7.2993,0.6417,1.4539,4.9391,6.8666,5.7703,4.5952,1.5091,1.85,8.3065,1.8989,6.9316,3.6739,1.9174,4.783,0.6071,2.5158,6.8665,4.1229,3.7704,3.3206,1.6544,4.621,1.06,1.8731,1.6422,0.3973,2.4994,1.5668,2.0421,0.1995,0.0063,0.5866,3.9821,5.5564,3.6401,2.1198,5.6805,3.1875,1.1775,0.7831,1.6659,0.9494,15.5552,0.4157,1.3332,0.4511,0.9122,0.3216,2.1772,4.4372,0.337,4.1246,4.2533,1.4152,0.0,4.5262,2.4277,0.7608,5.4988,1.1543,1.4399,2.9625,2.1343,3.5202,1.0581,0.7942,3.2275,0.5196,0.2785,4.3842,0.0006,2.1062,5.8155,1.2374,1.4625,0.9044,1.6309,0.3068,0.4724,1.1862,1.3554,4.4205,1.1975,2.0215,2.1606,1.9288,0.0739,0.8345,1.046,2.8426,0.4895,5.8384,1.9357,4.2238,0.8452,0.0059,4.1424,5.9545,0.7325,5.3863,5.9164,0.6161,1.9421,0.7811,1.0965,2.9056,3.4244,0.1685,4.269,2.0266,3.4577,3.1798,2.6417,4.5465,0.7509,1.8563,6.0948,3.3956,2.8201,1.2836,8.9996,0.0544,4.4614,1.1471,0.0017,4.6378,0.1398,2.1467,4.9161,3.037,0.5787,1.0381,6.6293,3.6957,3.3689,4.0622,1.3125,0.5174,0.1132,0.429,0.5863,0.8773,0.9353,6.7185,1.3092,0.8561,4.9478,1.919,1.7379,1.3631,5.3138,1.1242,4.85,1.7118,3.8699,2.9076,5.0329,8.6869,0.7882,1.8401,4.2527,4.3173,3.5466,2.6085,2.1296,2.2794,0.5987,0.3011,1.5018,3.8887,0.8458,1.6246,4.0254,0.1139,1.4306,4.3324,4.8311,1.0566,3.1617,2.5581,1.7626,0.8873,0.4731,0.808,1.4092,0.8754,2.4823,0.3449,0.0045,1.094,3.4008,5.8818,0.2498,0.7933,0.5116,3.0064,2.2723,2.5672,2.8273,3.7816,1.9938,1.042,0.6808,0.3261,4.1552,4.8391,4.2817,0.5198,0.4708,0.2249]}

The division was originally created as an alternative to the World Wrestling Federation's X Division which was scheduled to debut during the 2002 Survival of the Fittest PPV event, but due to several reasons was not shown that year as it was still being constructed. However, it would debut during TNA's third PPV event, the Worldwide Wars of the Roses Tournament that would go on to air in 2002. The X Division would also air its first ever televised match on June 20, 2002 during TNA's annual SummerSlam pay per view. After The Undertaker defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at SummerSlam, a six man tag team match was announced for the following PPV where the winner would face Kurt Angle after he had defeated Stone Cold for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVII. However, the match never took place as TNA cancelled its scheduled event later on in 2001. From late 2002 to early 2003 TNA had their main roster expand to over 40 members with their own house shows in different parts of the US.\nOn January 13, 2003, the X Division was renamed the TNA X Division to be more in line with the overall TNA brand name. However, the X Division had never been known for its tag teams and many fans were disappointed by this change. The X Division had their second house show and first main roster show hosted by Tommy Dreamer in San Diego, California on June 9,, 2003. The X Division had their main roster show and the second house show hosted Jimmy Yang at the San Jose, California's TNA house show on June 26,, 2003. The X Division hosted its third major PPV event, the No Mercy show on October 7.","token_len":400,"entropy":[7.1107,7.038,7.8603,5.5572,3.3977,4.6739,2.8066,2.707,3.5136,0.2803,3.8788,4.301,9.6839,5.853,2.1061,0.7059,4.2536,5.8395,6.0229,4.9484,0.0798,1.8591,4.8502,2.0385,10.2969,4.2462,1.701,0.1064,2.1548,8.9284,0.0128,9.0818,13.1362,3.3017,6.9423,6.2755,0.2239,0.0008,0.3619,1.7245,5.5303,3.1366,0.0109,2.3319,4.9315,1.1615,1.1059,4.6978,3.123,0.3963,0.1598,0.9618,5.6713,0.0946,0.0002,0.7285,1.2053,6.1008,1.3219,3.8738,3.229,2.2996,2.4287,2.7731,0.5812,0.7389,4.5561,1.3725,0.5216,1.4281,4.1617,1.0626,3.813,1.2482,6.4157,0.3297,3.0067,5.1272,0.8071,3.9256,12.7662,2.5423,0.0188,0.1779,0.071,0.0002,2.4815,0.0049,1.1567,2.4019,1.3416,3.5011,0.0063,5.9122,3.8764,3.845,3.7713,6.8623,5.7792,3.6155,3.5985,1.3639,0.6135,4.1274,2.4422,4.4172,0.7616,3.7804,0.2273,2.762,4.0928,3.8144,1.92,5.5262,0.0113,0.7956,4.0569,1.9623,0.002,0.409,0.8611,1.7484,8.0989,7.3954,2.6146,1.0014,5.277,6.6132,4.3585,3.022,4.1819,0.9547,0.1985,5.0136,1.6768,3.5586,0.5645,1.7753,3.5107,0.3068,1.8394,2.6837,4.4042,2.5084,0.963,3.4356,4.9071,2.9457,2.3411,3.5716,2.8009,0.3714,0.7748,4.1797,2.9557,0.0069,0.2707,4.4467,3.9732,0.5688,0.0079,5.2263,1.9292,0.0057,2.0804,4.5785,4.6397,4.7306,0.0033,1.2318,7.2918,0.0004,0.114,0.0002,2.8268,1.6521,0.0025,0.0006,1.0186,3.9372,6.4734,0.3002,0.7003,0.1021,0.3861,1.5091,2.8286,2.1333,0.6536,4.4251,4.2619,0.0037,6.7908,1.7478,3.7838,0.6279,1.1009,6.3759,0.0002,5.618,2.7706,2.6527,1.3207,4.4859,0.0038,5.7925,0.3345,4.0001,1.4587,1.4515,0.0007,0.1397,2.2245,2.3876,0.0962,1.8356,2.385,0.4765,3.7537,0.1205,1.5418,1.2369,3.9153,2.3127,0.0396,2.1926,2.5581,0.0035,4.9696,3.5671,3.7599,2.281,6.1156,3.5418,0.9887,5.1564,1.7176,7.0043,6.2179,1.5261,1.3819,1.0743,0.056,2.8705,0.0005,3.4737,4.2591,2.7256,2.7588,6.1861,0.9558,5.7266,3.5137,2.0181,2.5974,4.3963,3.8583,9.0633,3.4983,2.9719,6.0367,4.0898,0.0076,0.2154,4.2675,1.5095,2.1598,13.8647,2.4838,3.4534,0.0718,0.7942,0.7399,1.8066,2.6289,0.4546,1.4818,3.8842,1.1348,2.1718,0.0216,1.211,0.8391,3.3523,4.5465,2.8849,5.11,0.1893,0.0111,0.7363,5.8633,3.7723,0.0061,2.276,4.2014,0.6489,3.4719,0.1013,1.6574,2.5772,0.4019,2.7022,4.2707,1.185,4.1102,0.7459,1.1027,2.9099,2.6422,1.6991,4.9333,2.6282,2.0143,2.2216,2.3786,2.9919,0.7565,1.0672,1.7438,2.1275,0.2668,2.5571,5.4864,5.2344,5.1206,0.0311,4.0933,5.6039,4.4142,0.579,1.5938,5.3938,0.1509,5.843,0.0399,0.2214,2.256,4.5534,0.6197,1.3038,0.8675,1.5684,3.3048,3.4364,12.7741,2.1488,0.5423,1.162,2.9544,0.2355,2.0569,0.9431,3.312,0.0888,0.3841,2.3619,3.9085,2.8416,1.5123,0.0109,0.4422,11.5821,1.5303,2.9904,2.3661,3.6209,3.6513,3.4439,0.1987,7.0934,3.4416,0.9237,4.6329,0.4347,0.904,1.3677,3.9107,3.0834,0.427,0.2099,1.1151,1.8919,0.1233,3.1076,4.021,2.6783,4.3291,4.3119,0.0009,0.6617,0.6527,0.541,7.3603,1.1588,4.6824,1.3916,3.054,3.4031,3.4639]}

Sakuraba primarily worked on the battle themes and arrangements of previous themes, while Tamura handled selected boss battle tracks and themes from both the arcade and the console games.\nThe OST has a new instrumental theme song composed by Takeshi Ohba of Fes. Ohba composed an instrumental theme song for the series, and it was later used on all four remakes. The main game uses a remix of the instrumental theme song, composed in the style of a rock opera or classical music by Sakuraba himself, while Arcade Fighting has an overture performed by the original composition orchestra from the 1993 games. Boss Battles have the original rock opera song overlaid on the instrumental theme song. The remakes used their own additional themes. Fighting is the only game in the series to use the English lyrics to describe the soundtrack.\nIn a rare bit of fan service added, Fighting also has an additional instrumental rendition of the title theme music.\nThe soundtrack was mixed on the West Coast, with remixes added to the original tracks from Europe and Japan.

The song arrived in the rugby canon through the Welsh male voice choirs who sang many versions, including a version sung at the 2010 World Cup. The song is a rugby chant sung by fans and players of English rugby and most notably made famous the 2011 World Cup final between England and Australia. It was chosen as the official anthem at the 2011 World Cup final because of its traditional nature which made it an appealing song to a wide audience. The song, which has its origins in traditional English folk songs, has been called the national anthem of English rugby. The anthem is the sixth highest anthem in the sport's history. It has been performed at major sporting events, including several World Cup finals and the final England\/Wales match at Twickenham. According to the National Rugby League Board official website, it has been sung at every home game since 1995. \"England Singing '' is a song that has been widely adapted and is sung by fans during games. It is also used at tournaments as well as publicity and TV events. Most notably the song is used at the final match in England rugby at Twickenham which is in the South Bank stadium. The chant originally ran as the jingle on the BBC Radio 2 programme This Week in Music. The song is sung by the BBC Music Channel but can also be heard on other radio stations. In 2017 it was chosen as the UK national anthem by the BBC, but in 2018 the BBC withdrew this request because of the song's association with the military. In July 2018, the BBC announced it will have an ongoing \"World Anthem\" series hosted by Kate Garraway from July through to December 2019. The programme will have a new theme each month based on a different nation.

A major landfall was produced in the Gulf of Maine just south of Cape Ann.","token_len":403,"entropy":[9.4169,9.9959,2.4682,0.5653,2.1089,2.5152,6.4338,3.5538,4.9231,1.163,1.1862,0.5397,6.0169,2.8076,2.7811,0.9739,4.2973,1.3006,3.0954,3.4487,1.0546,8.1011,0.7429,1.1514,1.6023,6.1564,2.1624,11.212,6.8421,8.8808,7.0942,3.5512,2.1362,4.8787,7.3448,0.0244,2.8872,1.7871,2.4206,1.0253,0.5752,2.58,0.2102,2.6853,2.3106,4.9919,2.7267,1.9754,0.5296,1.589,0.1825,0.2383,1.881,0.0698,5.2244,0.7978,1.6424,5.6652,5.4716,4.2922,0.3941,1.1697,0.7552,3.8275,0.1243,3.0241,6.1909,0.4565,1.7493,0.0023,1.7932,2.1572,2.2177,6.6809,0.1646,0.4925,0.6807,0.2681,5.1772,1.6513,8.6451,7.9478,8.108,5.5813,5.5046,0.4305,3.295,2.76,7.1872,1.9064,3.7778,1.9398,3.7072,0.0013,0.4194,0.3318,0.3615,1.123,5.7316,0.3769,1.1512,0.5247,1.045,4.9477,1.6731,2.5392,0.3,0.8422,1.7513,0.19,1.534,7.1769,5.3482,0.798,0.5869,7.2651,0.0007,3.3813,1.0952,5.0123,0.3841,1.2934,1.9746,5.9123,4.8192,4.8458,1.2325,2.0803,7.6068,0.0489,3.7301,7.558,1.5076,0.5192,4.3198,1.6432,6.6274,1.2433,0.2065,0.1361,0.9565,4.6604,6.1189,0.3937,1.9067,1.3609,3.8732,0.7337,0.2312,1.443,4.1564,5.7097,2.5438,1.9992,1.8484,9.7091,3.4686,1.7512,7.3405,0.0239,4.2673,0.6824,3.4761,3.0083,2.114,4.4078,5.3489,0.7052,0.124,0.4218,4.4097,13.818,2.8301,2.7257,2.5551,2.7279,1.6051,0.5835,0.0197,0.9763,8.3211,0.5947,0.2555,1.3196,0.2698,1.1735,5.8285,1.5427,0.0227,2.4103,2.5161,3.9249,0.0242,2.0207,5.6177,4.9925,0.4898,0.1398,0.8425,0.7862,2.1242,6.1835,0.2375,2.7636,0.0004,5.2559,1.3294,0.3385,2.4934,4.0667,3.9955,0.1277,2.1063,1.8956,3.9311,1.7688,0.0079,1.7165,1.8407,3.7759,5.1497,0.0019,7.48,1.3874,0.7088,0.5274,1.0283,7.281,3.7671,0.546,2.285,0.9665,2.336,5.9343,0.8757,0.8441,0.6118,3.5128,1.8844,5.5867,4.2082,4.1767,0.7462,3.4504,0.5746,2.0042,1.2842,0.7959,1.067,5.268,1.3381,0.9519,0.6212,2.4693,7.2621,7.9421,8.1723,0.0348,1.0834,1.8495,1.579,5.0883,7.8006,6.2372,1.1222,5.0664,5.6587,3.8135,2.1695,0.2162,6.2061,0.3776,0.0933,0.1448,3.2101,0.8684,1.2505,3.829,0.2009,1.6537,3.3072,2.7111,6.6466,2.9308,1.5801,1.3647,0.007,0.8852,0.5555,1.9033,0.0131,1.7413,5.8839,0.3746,0.6979,0.9078,1.3635,3.5617,2.1776,1.0598,1.8724,10.9695,1.3087,5.7025,0.4414,4.6981,5.4426,1.0684,4.6308,0.0026,1.8221,1.7484,0.3089,3.1984,4.9142,4.1831,0.0591,8.5048,9.0909,1.9146,2.4263,0.6639,0.1818,0.0309,0.0028,0.9364,2.7121,1.1,0.3468,1.9006,7.7783,4.0418,0.2799,5.8579,0.0112,4.1991,5.1953,7.3218,2.2782,0.9385,5.4573,0.055,0.6803,1.6333,0.7292,0.2745,0.7105,2.7169,0.059,0.0636,5.1074,4.7433,4.4344,0.681,0.817,3.3133,0.2571,1.1189,2.5086,0.017,2.3872,0.031,1.5505,4.5283,6.2082,0.7945,2.5302,0.0131,1.2476,7.7289,5.6907,2.7995,5.0722,0.0936,4.7123,0.0534,1.3746,0.0449,2.9465,0.0176,2.4766,5.8401,4.943,0.006,8.5466,0.871,5.9809,4.536,3.9472,1.5658,7.5317,2.0698,1.6625,3.0003,0.1284,2.9537,5.6363,2.4314,0.0058,1.3747,4.8464,1.0241]}
{"prompt":"Publisher Kaspar Braun , who commissioned Busch 's first illustrations , had established the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving . This letterpress printing technique was developed by English graphic artist Thomas Bewick","text":"Publisher Kaspar Braun, who commissioned Busch's first illustrations, had established the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This letterpress printing technique was developed by English graphic artist Thomas Bewick and is still being used in the production of books. The techniques and skills of these artists led to the formation of the publishing trade in Germany.\nIn the late 1500s, in both England and Germany, artists were also writing books and illustrated their writing. In 1588, the work Heliodorus was illustrated by Thomas Nast, a contemporary of William Hogarth and James Gillray. Nast wrote four books from a combination of his illustrations with black-and-white or pen-and-ink type. This writing and illustration tradition was continued in German in the 18th Century by the Leipzig school. The Leipzig school was one of the most prominent groups of writers of editions illustrating each other's writings. These books became highly famous and were known in English as \"bookbubs\" since the illustrations on the front were printed with a raised bubble. Other groups of artists, such as the D\u00fcsseldorf school, followed the Leipzig artists with their own style.\nIn the late-1600s, William Hogarth and James Gillray set out to follow the Leipzig tradition by including both black-and-white written type and black-and-white illustrations. Gillray was a master in caricature which he illustrated with caricatured black-and-white portraits as well. Black-and-white illustrations were also used as a form of satire. In 1696, Hogarth published his most famous caricature of the British aristocracy, The Cuckolded Couple, created with black-and-white pen-and-ink portraits. Since most of his caricatures were printed in color, his black-and-white illustration was less celebrated. He began to experiment with colors in 1701, working with red and brown ink in his illustrations.","token_len":404,"entropy":[11.7752,2.7378,14.7092,1.765,2.7297,7.9714,10.1948,0.4614,1.781,3.9571,6.8371,1.2969,4.4451,7.6068,1.8501,3.5306,6.9622,1.7738,3.7052,3.647,4.3505,5.3358,5.1393,0.9408,0.0547,1.6745,3.6803,8.8913,5.4412,2.8718,3.705,1.3391,3.4446,0.8691,8.8286,5.9758,1.0476,3.6404,3.8728,4.7656,1.4619,1.6958,3.8498,2.2969,4.0419,0.5239,1.2562,2.0813,5.3078,0.0716,4.0861,1.8425,2.3423,5.9485,3.6804,7.2351,0.9452,3.4426,1.1125,5.0354,0.4002,0.9018,3.1536,0.0327,0.9968,7.2814,4.3716,2.0714,2.1944,1.1967,1.204,7.3721,2.0922,2.4513,6.3718,0.2658,0.6256,4.7611,8.0638,2.5035,0.0251,1.068,0.1483,4.4617,2.4417,5.0772,5.5706,3.3319,2.4035,5.5881,4.2853,7.1993,0.8049,2.287,4.4583,4.8389,0.4542,2.283,5.507,12.0257,5.64,1.8776,3.4827,4.8018,0.833,3.3454,5.3858,5.7599,1.9364,1.9779,5.4543,0.1568,6.3341,6.0084,0.1352,2.8299,5.3503,6.9128,10.1318,0.7849,3.0719,0.0015,4.4823,5.3193,1.8862,5.5633,3.8294,5.7669,0.0237,3.3151,4.5009,2.6437,7.0536,2.8581,0.0617,0.0073,0.0057,6.8072,5.4604,0.8563,0.4679,0.0038,2.4994,5.1879,1.5132,3.4613,6.7217,4.5747,2.3759,6.4205,1.93,3.5336,1.63,5.2988,5.0851,0.414,3.6251,0.3045,3.9115,1.7358,2.0703,6.4604,1.243,0.0064,6.0171,3.2466,2.2645,2.2952,0.0047,0.0116,0.8366,1.9228,3.8802,0.0134,0.1977,2.504,3.0314,5.8901,0.7438,5.0368,2.3096,12.5805,8.8247,6.7958,0.9596,0.7683,4.3883,0.5506,4.1123,2.2189,4.1014,5.0946,5.929,1.9582,2.4543,5.0832,2.8717,3.2572,1.4192,1.7368,6.3288,5.8703,10.3133,1.4806,6.3307,1.908,6.6904,3.9623,1.1167,3.1566,3.2845,2.7364,2.4768,2.8249,8.2953,9.7683,2.2205,5.4437,5.1885,0.7248,1.6369,2.8479,1.156,0.0016,1.9015,5.919,1.4138,0.8091,0.0043,0.0014,0.0038,0.8472,0.8334,5.0844,1.6832,2.2215,0.0036,0.0232,8.4228,3.3777,1.4763,2.5601,2.0666,1.4245,1.1259,2.035,1.2271,2.3051,6.0371,3.0305,0.0267,0.2269,5.9098,0.5207,0.0027,2.3964,0.3353,0.043,0.016,5.836,0.9202,0.398,7.4992,0.8535,1.5929,0.0024,0.0232,4.6787,2.3272,6.7341,5.0053,1.3344,1.1667,0.0496,0.002,0.0011,8.6571,4.2881,0.4923,1.8186,0.2765,0.0268,0.0018,0.0167,2.7843,0.9666,4.635,0.0181,2.5157,1.6063,4.285,3.5945,8.4389,4.6375,1.8715,2.9393,1.8766,8.116,2.9625,0.1406,4.3703,1.7186,0.0276,0.0013,0.0035,7.3169,4.7237,0.3631,4.7179,7.879,0.2249,0.0023,0.0008,0.0087,0.6751,0.9813,2.3284,1.5302,2.3695,1.9543,2.6784,0.11,6.1373,1.9056,2.0384,1.6336,5.3472,0.2456,2.3208,0.0005,2.3766,1.7901,4.6318,0.4114,5.0291,1.4062,2.2575,4.8212,5.7691,1.4245,2.6032,6.1928,1.7928,4.9125,8.0821,0.5284,0.855,6.522,3.6211,1.0713,0.4768,0.0048,0.0007,0.003,5.4359,0.4342,0.0154,0.0036,0.0154,7.2277,0.6612,6.4114,5.642,0.5227,2.5378,3.9079,0.3141,0.6262,3.6588,1.767,4.9007,0.4538,3.6472,3.4591,0.1966,0.0016,0.0004,0.0009,3.0495,1.4959,5.6987,8.0553,0.9865,3.536,3.9756,0.9735,5.1761,0.0846,5.3222,1.5913,4.0568,3.1258,1.4987,5.3281,1.1079,5.0586,1.5516,4.4027,2.6297,3.1685,1.6883,1.914,0.5784]}

In 1949 , Du Bois spoke at the Scientific and Cultural Conference","text":"Du Bois was a lifelong anti @ - @ war activist, but his efforts became more pronounced after World War II. In 1949, Du Bois spoke at the Scientific and Cultural Conference sponsored by the Institute of International Education to promote racial justice in U.S. cities. He was able to speak against racism and slavery with the support of Black Power leaders who had not seen him since his death in 1915. By the 1960s, the use of his name was associated with anti -racism as much as Du Bois\u2019 message.\nIn 1964, when Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, she was able to get the support of Du Bois and many other Black political figures. It is often said that Du Bois was the primary proponent behind Chisholm. Chisholm gained publicity from the New York Times article on Chisholm\u2019s record as a lawyer. The article was written by Louis Brandeis. Brandeis was Du Bois\u2019 former student and both men maintained a close friendship through Du Bois\u2019 lifetime until Brandeis died in 1972.\nEven though Du Bois\u2019 major achievement was creating the NAACP, the organization was always divided. In the 1940s, Du Bois faced many attacks from a group called the Freedom Democratic Party, who were trying to remove the influence of Du Bois from within the organization. As a result, Du Bois faced many difficulties and came up with numerous strategies by which the NAACP could be unified to become an even more influential organization.\nThe group started a new newspaper called Struggle, and used literature to create a forum which involved Black writers and activists. The news paper also supported educational programs which would bring together Black leaders from all levels of society. In addition to this, the Struggle group was also involved in fundraising, which would help Du Bois in his efforts regarding the establishment of the Freedom Park in Philadelphia.","token_len":404,"entropy":[8.8375,2.209,5.1351,2.445,6.6305,7.0882,13.7829,10.2623,3.859,8.3563,6.8787,1.9676,3.996,3.4916,5.5955,5.6793,2.6367,5.5819,1.9663,6.2132,0.0466,0.1624,0.6959,3.3024,4.5534,0.6019,6.9471,0.0769,0.0015,5.9661,1.2579,1.0825,9.7585,3.1099,2.7605,3.2621,6.2998,0.0137,0.3598,4.2631,0.9347,2.8366,4.0775,5.1409,2.2586,5.8528,3.284,1.6939,4.7823,0.0272,0.0361,0.0683,7.3741,0.4619,1.6791,1.4768,6.2282,0.0117,3.3246,4.2953,2.715,1.5454,5.1411,4.675,1.9558,2.7002,0.03,4.6994,4.0793,3.4477,4.0679,3.1451,5.5508,3.7352,2.5613,4.8127,2.4461,3.5598,1.1098,7.4367,0.1491,5.8082,1.7778,1.842,0.1355,0.6121,4.1442,7.185,0.0074,4.0426,1.8966,2.7155,5.739,0.0816,3.3828,8.0763,4.7503,0.0432,4.8709,3.952,0.034,7.8121,0.0101,0.0014,12.1958,8.1284,10.2604,0.563,1.3679,7.3996,3.7824,0.1635,4.0698,8.5985,2.8876,0.7948,0.0003,0.0001,2.7224,0.864,0.537,2.2709,1.4027,0.4934,2.8092,0.1194,2.2262,0.8527,0.0004,0.0025,0.0181,1.4396,0.2695,0.0215,0.3267,1.7564,2.0011,3.808,0.0071,3.8019,2.2033,2.6368,0.0693,4.3547,0.0191,0.0017,2.047,3.5806,1.0435,2.2889,3.4981,1.8257,1.0626,4.5495,2.4003,4.3447,0.8174,0.1019,2.0872,0.0221,0.0014,1.2344,1.1363,6.7695,5.2042,5.6787,6.1228,0.0196,0.0045,0.0027,3.7786,3.0964,0.0038,0.0024,0.0022,5.8821,6.2748,3.9552,1.714,5.5822,0.4238,0.4567,5.0213,2.6402,2.4956,0.0146,0.0082,0.0042,2.6365,0.3776,1.588,5.3592,2.968,0.8967,5.816,1.9955,2.8108,1.191,2.013,3.781,0.3758,4.98,3.7736,0.1934,0.0002,2.6091,4.4328,0.0034,0.0009,1.9472,7.6659,0.0166,0.002,0.6319,0.0424,7.9067,6.1521,2.2402,9.1437,7.3893,7.2935,1.6585,1.015,1.7539,4.9999,1.9829,0.0254,0.0043,1.7122,0.0148,5.9614,7.4008,3.1426,0.0029,0.0013,1.8126,0.5748,4.3043,0.2276,1.2463,6.3136,1.3002,1.4697,0.0166,0.0015,2.413,0.01,8.8143,6.8688,0.8403,5.7228,1.8523,4.4601,1.2356,2.4461,3.1306,1.5411,5.3064,5.3687,1.6131,2.7203,1.8317,4.4276,0.0835,0.4279,1.9185,0.0154,0.002,6.8772,3.7094,5.1621,1.242,4.8618,2.6057,1.9349,0.4529,5.5179,6.8741,0.6841,1.9693,2.1708,2.297,3.3017,0.0086,4.1799,2.5008,5.3287,0.0933,1.9954,0.0081,0.003,2.9044,7.1265,0.2619,0.722,0.2318,4.5054,1.2281,0.2265,0.3953,0.924,0.0052,0.0025,5.212,2.0284,4.7639,2.6172,5.101,2.7498,0.6084,5.1139,2.6531,5.9357,0.2825,3.0534,4.0868,0.9792,2.1215,7.0638,4.2052,5.5913,2.9125,4.0298,1.3433,4.5774,2.4201,0.3669,1.2508,2.5467,4.0615,4.4026,3.452,2.5402,7.3345,1.0934,8.6734,2.9845,2.3845,5.526,8.1957,2.286,3.8792,1.118,6.9329,4.9723,6.9588,3.9631,4.5977,1.1307,1.5215,0.7352,1.5875,6.4629,6.1791,3.6494,5.173,6.6556,1.7103,2.9044,3.7241,4.2521,2.4574,2.0404,3.296,2.2254,1.5515,4.6919,0.3529,0.7464,0.9814,2.5974,2.6794,1.6814,3.2011,0.3061,1.4983,4.8077,3.4335,2.3608,1.9328,2.4345,0.2106,7.1537,2.9365,2.6112,3.387,1.9424,2.1131,0.0035,0.0015,3.7492,0.7673,2.8458,9.1835,1.8348,7.2689,0.0397,1.1369,4.0278,11.9347,2.9688,5.496,0.5223]}

They were located at present-day Nebraska City of Blackbirdsville. In the spring of 1798 Chief Blackbird and his band went up through the Platte Valley in a war party attempting to drive off the Omahas. The Omahas won the battle but lost a number of men to disease. The Omahas and the Omaha-Wahtuck agency agreed to a cessation of hostilities. However, the Omahas refused to disband their war bands or join the Omaha-Wahtuck Agency, preferring to fight both the Omaha and the United States.\nDuring the early 1850s, Kitkehahki and Sioux tribal leaders and a number of chiefs went to Fort Benton (present-day St. George, Utah) intending to form a tribe under U.S. rule. Among the newcomers were Pawnee chiefs Big Bower and Little Wolf. The United States responded by forcibly breaking up the camp a few miles away from Fort Benton and then destroying the camp in an attempted massacre. When Fort Meade was built in the area the Omahas lived in Fort Meade and it was through the Fort Meade that they received government welfare. When Fort Meade was destroyed by a flood the Omahas were forced to move to Fort Benton and they remained in Fort Benton until 1860 when they were all forced to leave.\nIn the 1850s, Native Americans lived among and on reservations within the United States and received a number of benefits including education, healthcare, and a yearly allowance. Among these tribes was the Omaha-Sioux tribe. The reservation for the Omahas was located in present-day Nebraska and it was called the Omaha-Wahtuck Reservation, which also had reservations for the Kickapoo and Omaha-Omaha tribes.","token_len":406,"entropy":[8.0976,1.447,2.5616,11.6922,7.7091,4.3998,4.7345,6.2638,4.8435,3.1742,1.5471,9.6565,8.1338,4.9921,4.052,1.118,1.8144,10.5888,3.4717,5.813,2.8186,5.7037,0.8205,0.9763,0.0109,5.5007,7.4049,5.248,0.4374,2.9747,3.9798,8.9619,0.1389,0.563,1.6128,4.0515,0.8096,9.9203,1.0581,2.1127,1.4234,6.5562,2.2212,8.5398,3.2218,0.0038,4.2085,4.0459,5.6699,6.7946,3.5043,7.905,1.441,3.1809,1.904,3.6134,0.0552,0.1766,0.663,6.5916,0.1627,0.0019,3.2351,0.6129,3.992,4.629,3.0238,5.5067,0.5506,8.6146,0.0454,2.7083,3.3193,2.4849,7.2659,5.6022,8.7664,0.0263,4.8877,2.9987,0.722,4.9335,0.0153,0.0141,0.739,1.6683,2.3636,0.0078,0.0023,4.8681,2.1211,0.7287,2.0661,2.7102,3.2103,2.9122,0.0085,2.89,3.3687,4.1909,0.7227,1.7112,2.5158,0.0053,0.0021,4.602,1.3814,3.7245,4.5977,4.5496,5.5294,5.0765,5.9647,12.8396,5.7445,0.2887,3.0089,7.5799,0.0933,0.1094,1.3768,3.9593,0.3818,1.4576,2.2135,0.0044,0.0036,4.1102,0.2556,4.7602,3.945,4.0881,4.3522,4.735,3.6557,0.8234,2.1793,0.4452,0.1553,0.008,0.0033,0.0844,4.932,2.3786,4.6953,0.9904,2.7159,6.7979,1.0108,1.1372,1.8951,1.2452,6.4808,0.3197,1.7229,1.982,9.2556,0.34,4.0014,6.2382,0.5764,2.0782,9.1931,0.064,0.0495,0.0422,3.8681,3.6453,6.7677,4.7862,1.2257,4.4722,3.8916,1.6587,0.0089,5.4512,4.5738,0.77,5.2341,6.0793,0.029,5.0962,5.5255,0.3992,0.0061,5.0411,0.43,3.8545,1.1858,3.9027,0.5023,8.884,0.0316,4.2817,0.4769,4.6394,3.6026,6.5548,0.1915,0.1249,0.0153,3.7289,0.3358,5.5772,0.6646,6.8258,0.8114,6.5065,3.1252,0.0898,5.5062,9.4986,5.7189,5.9191,1.4211,5.742,7.9719,1.0025,1.6609,5.1444,0.0561,5.524,0.6459,6.4745,5.509,0.7768,0.3765,6.6134,7.6067,0.8507,2.0652,2.0688,1.8918,2.8023,0.016,0.0002,1.9842,4.5887,5.137,0.7587,1.6491,3.0249,3.2563,5.1909,4.3022,0.5258,4.5281,3.9543,9.8631,0.448,0.8499,3.8383,1.2633,2.799,4.8329,2.8952,2.731,0.0051,0.0052,7.7789,1.1974,5.2854,1.0927,0.0018,1.9999,5.5191,0.5854,6.5577,1.2544,5.2544,0.3611,0.0033,3.2431,1.6756,4.5406,5.5659,6.5954,0.9917,4.0849,2.8993,0.8181,0.0006,0.237,2.2999,2.3251,2.3532,5.3463,2.3118,0.3379,0.0049,0.0019,2.0169,1.3805,0.1583,1.569,1.0383,1.8593,2.4683,0.0005,2.2479,4.0409,3.5023,2.1333,1.0996,1.0826,0.0006,0.8252,5.4439,1.5945,1.2042,1.1459,6.6051,4.1224,0.288,1.7571,1.2095,1.0818,2.3306,1.3495,3.575,0.0614,1.9478,6.4891,0.82,5.8265,4.5995,6.1176,4.5401,2.6282,4.451,0.4585,3.3607,0.0052,1.9934,5.9011,3.5359,3.7393,0.0015,1.8937,2.7368,4.6105,0.5646,4.1633,0.3512,1.2172,2.917,7.1179,2.6574,1.2286,4.7288,1.5998,4.3801,2.6303,0.3715,2.9784,0.695,9.1257,0.0002,2.5714,0.7513,1.3702,7.0778,5.9476,0.602,1.2884,0.0064,0.0048,0.7386,2.0289,1.2347,7.0541,0.1602,0.0013,2.2534,3.7101,2.9197,0.6908,3.91,0.9689,1.9777,0.516,2.1239,0.0421,0.0022,0.0209,4.9736,0.0014,3.3584,2.2792,4.1396,2.7846,4.5754,1.3278,0.556,13.7046,3.7072,0.0228,1.8494,3.9503,0.4842,4.1952,0.1172,0.2509,1.15,0.1944]}
{"prompt":"During the summers of the mid @ - @ 20th century , parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis ( or polio ) , which was commonly known as ``","text":"During the summers of the mid @ - @ 20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis ( or polio ), which was commonly known as `` Little Stuff. '' A recent report from Canada details its effects on a rural Quebec community where parents feared `` the polio bug. '' The report details changes a community made to meet the demands of the polio outbreak ; and notes how these changes may be considered a failure. Some schools, for example, closed for a long period of time. Others did not close completely - instead, teachers worked off-site from the school buildings to maintain a full teaching service to the community during the outbreak. Other changes included : more vaccinations ; expanded health programs; higher sanitation standards; stricter public hygiene guidelines; an attempt to create a `` polio-free status '' for a community ; and an attempt to make the local population immune to the virus. In the end, the program met with some success. The changes implemented helped reduce the number of new cases of polio in the area : in fact, during the peak of the virus's infection the school attendance dropped from 85 to 35 per cent. However, as the virus itself disappeared from the community, so too did the desire to maintain the new, protective measures and regulations. A major reason for this is that the community may have not understood the significance of many of these changes. It remains to be seen whether or not the measures and regulations put in place in Quebec are now being considered by other communities. The report also notes that the community that responded to the polio outbreak with such a vigorous public-health response also experienced a high and increasing number of cases of other communicable disease, such as tuberculosis, in spite of a relatively tight public health surveillance system in place. The report points out that the community has since moved beyond the polio-circumstance response, yet even several years after the outbreak it is likely that the effects of the disease will still have an impact on future generations of children and adults.","token_len":407,"entropy":[1.9437,10.1849,1.4791,2.5298,4.3492,14.7194,7.303,5.2295,3.4868,2.595,0.4225,0.7809,9.3357,3.4026,1.8766,2.5173,2.3219,2.7536,10.1595,1.5205,7.3413,5.9087,0.0429,10.2269,2.8083,0.1757,0.0136,0.0136,2.8477,9.3541,3.8374,2.5003,2.3912,1.8596,5.8312,3.3133,0.2671,8.9143,11.4389,9.2946,3.1464,3.616,4.6953,5.251,2.9469,1.8299,7.1222,7.6882,5.7752,4.7298,0.4779,4.5404,7.3301,7.4792,1.8758,4.2483,5.2239,3.5232,6.5306,4.38,4.1535,4.9082,2.7134,3.8766,2.0669,2.0993,4.432,7.4744,7.139,5.509,2.4453,2.6739,5.8717,1.1939,3.7969,0.0816,1.413,2.3893,4.0278,9.6351,3.9045,5.3869,2.8238,4.6293,0.4923,4.0019,2.6176,5.7704,2.2695,5.2907,2.4838,4.8117,6.0518,2.6331,1.9513,0.3673,0.0506,5.5803,2.8602,2.5783,5.1281,1.5741,0.7287,0.026,2.3467,3.8378,3.7818,0.146,3.6218,6.1822,5.1187,5.8982,0.6533,4.5597,5.4632,5.96,1.104,1.2353,5.7788,2.0617,2.6468,6.1685,1.9244,4.3281,2.286,5.7356,6.6413,7.5732,4.2497,1.8808,1.1397,5.8801,0.5139,3.1315,0.227,4.4387,3.7501,2.5614,8.0902,5.0289,6.0056,4.3607,5.0983,4.58,3.2361,2.6046,5.7178,7.4689,2.8309,1.2997,5.5626,5.7053,5.1693,4.6748,1.0606,4.7529,6.358,0.2213,4.8185,0.7805,2.8227,5.5831,2.6989,0.2342,9.7644,5.2754,1.638,4.5501,2.0452,5.1567,0.7957,2.843,2.1916,0.1538,3.6252,2.0163,4.6938,3.0578,3.2985,0.3658,1.055,2.2286,0.4457,2.6355,1.9546,3.0548,0.1402,1.1574,4.4287,6.7014,2.4328,3.191,0.5732,0.8428,2.1934,6.2818,6.8672,6.412,2.831,0.551,1.3907,0.0198,5.6148,0.6787,1.2785,0.4601,1.3382,0.8192,3.1418,7.9248,3.011,4.4532,0.0484,5.1971,0.3674,5.3157,0.3113,0.2862,5.0864,1.4441,6.0789,4.3367,4.2203,4.944,2.1093,1.2497,5.4408,2.2068,4.4222,1.8877,0.5318,0.8042,3.9045,0.0258,3.8057,0.922,1.5214,7.1646,6.5116,2.0485,0.5724,2.803,0.7121,3.8312,2.2509,0.0623,0.4712,6.1699,0.466,3.4715,1.7321,6.7541,4.4769,5.9288,4.7103,4.3424,6.4239,1.1132,3.9778,5.0188,3.1949,0.423,1.5522,2.4104,0.6601,1.5579,3.2488,5.823,0.9292,3.8738,4.1848,0.8863,4.805,0.0392,6.6569,0.2956,1.6719,0.7403,0.857,3.6133,6.3401,0.6303,0.0054,0.0159,0.9332,3.0091,0.0126,1.1813,6.474,3.4898,0.3444,5.4169,0.1409,0.0025,2.3549,4.8538,2.8543,5.3441,2.6144,3.8328,2.149,3.4049,1.8974,1.2938,2.386,3.9922,1.6091,1.3735,0.6857,1.6548,3.3939,5.5065,4.7847,0.2601,0.4638,2.5843,2.7231,6.3061,4.4044,2.3641,5.2043,4.0331,4.2125,1.3472,1.3312,4.0151,2.5532,1.5076,4.5718,7.2258,3.4882,1.526,0.001,2.9815,0.7888,3.099,3.4524,0.0001,4.1979,1.8177,0.9906,0.0016,2.256,1.1965,3.458,5.1797,0.0075,3.1187,3.8017,6.0011,4.642,1.454,5.1069,0.6255,3.8009,2.2035,0.3543,2.006,1.7003,4.4892,0.4086,0.2921,1.5741,2.7556,2.5897,5.6402,3.9155,3.2979,1.1385,4.1503,2.7085,11.4461,2.3563,0.5002,1.5096,4.9267,2.1204,7.0099,5.0835,7.9957,1.7585,0.859,0.4259,1.7507,3.3717,2.6578,7.9975,0.3665,1.4225,6.5626,0.3775,0.8443,3.8649,1.0285,2.203,3.0859,2.0153,0.5188,0.594,3.8593,1.2893,2.2378,1.0289,2.1249,0.8818,0.3509]}

Rajamouli had also tried to cast her as a supporting actor in his upcoming film Kalank but she couldn\u2019t make it.\nRavikant was previously approached by both Mani Ratnam and L N Ravikant for his upcoming films and he turned them down.\nThe shooting of Kalank began on February 21, with an opening day of around 5000 to 6000 people attending the shooting. In the first few days, the crew had to face a few incidents. Rajamouli told NDTV that shooting stopped for some time because of a protest from locals over the movie\u2019s location in Palani village. Some groups stopped filming at night and forced the crew to vacate the village.\nKalank is based on Vedam Srinivas\u2019s Ramayan - inspired novel, and takes place around 1000 years after the start of the tale in the epic Ramayan. Directed by Mani Ratnam, it stars Ram Charan as Sugreev, Tamannaah and Kajal Aggarwal in lead roles. The film is about the legendary love story of a prince (Ram Charan) and a princess ( Tamannaah ), between two cultures.

The storm tracked northwest, becoming a hurricane on September 24. On September 25, it attained minimum barometric pressure of 978 millibars (27.93 hPa) but maintained a relatively straight-line course across the Atlantic. With winds of 95 kt, the remnants of Irene became the strongest Atlantic cyclone of 2017 and the third strongest in Atlantic history, trailing Irma and Florence. Despite its size, the remnants of Irene did not become a major tropical storm.\nDuring the storm surge surge caused by Hurricane Irene, the New York City government declared a state of emergency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declared a state of emergency for the State of New Jersey around 1 p.m. on September 25 after the New York State Emergency Operations Center, declaring the state of emergency. The Army Corps of Engineers had to turn away requests for assistance to evacuate. The total storm surge height was estimated at 1.75 feet (0.65\u00a0m) in Staten Island.  Residents who evacuated to safe spots were warned that further upriver flooding was possible. Water continued to rise upriver over the next few days. By September 29 Irene was downgraded to a remnant low-pressure system, and by October 1 it had disaggregated into rainbands in the western Caribbean Sea, a remnant of the tropical storm had drifted across the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic, and a remnant of the tropical depression moved inland into northwest Florida.\nA remnant of Irene entered the waters off the coast of Cape Verde on October 2 and, after weakening to a tropical disturbance, weakened further as it drifted across the Atlantic. Its remnants produced rains from Newfoundland to Georgia. It was still expected to produce heavy rainfall as it turned north along the Atlantic coast, and, although it has dissipated, remnants remain a category 1 cyclone over Morocco on October 5.","token_len":409,"entropy":[11.3175,7.9734,1.8649,9.7248,10.7509,12.093,4.7202,1.4544,8.0286,3.4714,2.1327,0.2153,5.2515,3.3032,0.0006,5.2041,3.4791,3.4755,0.4871,3.5917,6.8214,7.3102,10.3632,0.1771,1.8051,0.0893,4.9794,4.0824,0.6788,2.1492,1.7592,6.9281,5.4879,2.8866,6.2335,1.3072,4.0564,2.506,1.5392,1.1904,1.0742,3.7831,0.5799,0.4341,0.1564,2.4657,9.4481,9.3258,9.2767,0.0549,0.0737,1.26,9.0876,2.3739,2.1519,0.0213,1.9538,6.5306,1.1033,6.3408,8.5746,0.0429,1.1806,4.7927,4.8984,1.3257,4.3942,4.5993,2.8019,0.1234,2.5075,3.7649,0.3698,1.4787,1.2851,5.4642,3.767,0.6601,4.8019,4.261,1.6538,1.1864,1.0347,8.6851,0.0501,6.6932,0.0005,5.2149,2.138,2.4094,5.1506,5.7768,0.019,2.2533,3.617,2.9364,2.6356,3.3336,1.6709,1.7628,5.4821,1.4081,1.9526,2.9292,4.3495,1.8164,7.4984,1.0328,5.8297,1.5657,4.1699,0.3189,0.8981,4.7199,0.1745,1.3755,0.0007,3.904,0.2124,3.8025,1.2983,2.078,4.3388,1.2731,2.5871,1.0386,12.5335,0.8665,2.3453,4.4377,4.4123,5.1131,0.0284,1.6552,3.4009,0.001,0.3214,1.5977,5.7543,0.7282,1.3198,4.8143,2.95,0.9938,1.4342,0.0526,0.0619,2.1455,2.0875,1.8748,4.5273,0.0017,0.0063,0.0035,2.6926,0.1836,0.0185,0.0005,2.6781,0.6708,1.4585,0.029,0.1255,1.9502,1.4261,6.1952,0.0602,0.2061,2.4713,9.1739,2.5986,0.7778,0.0008,0.0004,0.0522,1.9099,0.4784,2.2226,5.0466,2.1254,4.0089,0.6293,2.4818,3.3067,3.2789,0.0611,3.632,10.6378,2.1293,1.4128,0.1695,0.1593,1.3935,1.5146,4.3698,0.0366,0.6555,0.0012,4.1042,4.6432,5.1861,3.6322,7.4475,0.402,2.2517,2.8438,2.3449,4.6544,1.7982,6.5051,4.0378,0.2401,5.3603,1.1588,3.4827,0.3383,2.4302,1.4171,4.4413,2.3599,0.9202,3.152,0.0187,4.1465,17.0169,0.7895,1.2654,2.6388,5.8049,0.0014,1.2474,7.1396,18.6299,2.9729,4.4167,3.4409,5.0756,3.8216,1.5831,3.887,1.7711,5.714,6.7779,2.5083,2.9905,2.1517,0.8636,0.5758,6.2563,3.7304,0.1641,2.6988,4.408,2.8821,4.8062,0.5682,1.5006,1.6221,0.6909,1.611,4.0804,2.3137,2.4933,8.9207,0.0005,1.1865,4.5918,1.6039,0.4008,0.6458,9.7651,7.5589,1.9959,1.4543,2.3267,1.4722,1.6398,3.5689,1.1931,2.6562,1.8973,1.4208,15.8624,0.0544,0.0028,0.7723,8.9127,9.9919,4.0923,1.1391,5.0248,4.808,4.5464,1.8663,3.6265,3.2721,4.3543,1.2926,4.3189,1.5342,9.1676,5.282,3.8533,0.311,7.1146,4.1745,0.4568,0.9998,6.17,0.0034,0.502,0.1686,1.6176,0.538,0.8009,0.7529,3.2031,5.4812,7.7619,2.2892,2.7321,6.3275,1.0236,0.2304,1.4092,3.6431,4.394,1.8526,1.5231,0.0006,6.6167,0.5868,5.3478,1.6958,1.1187,1.389,0.0235,4.3911,0.2173,0.0003,0.7869,0.8023,2.1745,2.3413,4.5116,2.8722,5.9443,2.1716,0.5615,2.6868,6.311,0.6784,5.0213,3.5455,4.5999,0.9539,2.4987,3.2495,0.2209,0.9053,1.0075,4.7411,4.8516,7.328,7.5402,4.4153,8.1628,1.6087,5.3849,2.3615,3.237,1.7569,4.4898,4.7954,0.1652,3.6023,3.2614,1.5161,3.9995,1.185,4.7962,1.8649,3.5151,0.1987,1.6355,0.6611,1.6736,2.195,4.1846,4.0466,1.1163,5.6617,5.6709,0.0008,1.1364,5.3141,3.3992,2.69,7.4594,1.7098,5.5371,0.007,6.0037,11.7418,3.2856,0.4663,2.3446,0.6727]}

[ 3 ]\nThe group consists of 14 members. They also have guest singers on a few songs such as Geri Halliwell, Gwen Stefani, and JLS ( Jenifer Lopez, Lisa Scott Lee ). Their other featured singers, such as Lenny Kravitz and the Jonas Brothers, had already signed to other labels. Backstreet Boys and their other tour partners ( including JLS ) were originally scheduled to perform at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, but their performance was canceled less than 2 weeks before in response to an anti-war protest. This protest was the result of the deaths of 3 American soldiers in Afghanistan ; 3 protesters were killed while 3 were injured.\nThis single became a Top Ten hit, peaking at No. 6 on the US pop singles chart. In Australia and New Zealand the song made the Top 20. Their fifth album, No Promises, released in Australia and New Zealand on 9 June 2006 and in the United States on 4 July 2006, was written by Ryan Tedder. It was recorded in Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles, CA. The video contains the Backstreet Boys as well as B.D. Wong, from Full of it, and several different other cameos.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland no additional singles from the album have been released apart from the B-side \"Girl in a Web\". Two further songs from the album were released in February 2006; a cover of \"Good Times\", released as a promotional single in the United Kingdom and in the United States as a pre-order bonus for the album release on 4 July 2006. The version released on No Promises includes the group performing the song with the Backstreet Boys, along with the original artists.","token_len":410,"entropy":[7.7673,4.8843,0.1722,2.7219,10.0973,0.9273,1.8557,9.7894,4.7913,8.2116,9.5317,2.6513,0.3512,4.2857,0.0027,6.3535,2.5508,2.6053,7.4262,0.1536,3.7252,2.6628,0.2876,8.2972,3.139,4.1179,4.2024,1.1765,7.7787,0.6161,5.0675,1.0483,2.4344,8.5144,0.2348,0.0034,2.8595,1.9793,1.5542,4.7631,1.9918,1.3977,1.912,5.7105,6.5409,6.2291,0.0081,6.6444,2.6314,3.1987,8.5446,2.9446,4.4813,1.8556,0.689,2.6305,4.4008,6.1224,4.2356,0.5037,5.61,7.1959,0.1107,1.1615,8.917,6.0897,7.5063,0.0446,6.3838,1.1698,2.6494,3.0626,3.9883,1.6488,8.1995,3.881,4.3363,3.6966,2.8878,1.5121,4.7683,0.0014,9.4001,2.6077,6.1507,2.1004,0.0042,0.9965,5.5779,2.0346,0.3534,0.0001,0.4329,2.3416,4.9359,8.3863,3.9638,11.3136,3.0092,7.6845,2.3081,5.7913,7.322,8.6216,1.3761,3.9812,4.7021,5.7197,3.0308,3.6849,4.2352,0.0013,4.9489,2.5431,0.6254,0.0005,0.0012,1.3325,4.4408,7.4794,0.0643,0.4161,5.6779,4.2731,2.219,1.1954,3.9773,3.6254,1.0867,8.9388,8.6701,0.0294,3.0327,4.3053,4.9554,5.1453,3.2257,4.0659,4.7369,5.0786,1.4663,0.7989,2.32,6.0979,2.1614,0.1012,1.5512,0.9203,0.8834,6.7473,4.6833,0.6029,2.3627,0.7665,1.6094,4.1955,4.1253,0.9125,2.4602,8.7631,0.0017,4.7074,1.1301,1.6366,6.8101,3.7873,0.0045,3.0929,3.746,0.0043,5.2576,0.9144,1.5002,4.7229,4.8596,1.1003,4.0737,2.4037,0.0025,1.6238,6.861,0.0818,5.7581,4.7134,0.9008,1.354,2.0993,8.4666,5.2147,7.7946,0.6163,0.8633,3.9953,7.9347,1.9378,1.0266,1.4204,2.3003,4.3794,8.3261,6.4362,1.2612,6.1075,2.1472,0.7873,2.6074,7.5699,0.0115,0.0662,1.3611,0.0451,3.3051,0.413,0.3158,3.6363,5.0854,4.3221,0.293,1.558,2.9045,6.3079,3.1023,1.1059,0.0204,2.9174,1.544,4.8721,2.0417,0.3201,2.6346,2.4618,6.7699,5.6261,1.1037,0.58,5.2875,8.2725,0.3186,0.8284,4.1457,0.4261,5.5059,2.6006,0.0632,0.0038,1.6317,4.582,2.5027,1.4849,3.0993,2.3998,1.3866,1.9133,0.4419,0.3366,3.3138,1.1133,0.3225,0.3177,1.5867,6.1542,0.4065,5.6207,8.0576,1.239,1.8993,2.2964,1.2042,4.0188,1.8393,3.1313,1.1008,0.5334,1.5289,1.5112,8.5687,0.0033,0.6931,2.822,0.9958,1.8385,5.108,6.3951,2.1928,11.4165,0.0211,0.0468,6.7817,2.3868,0.0194,7.4691,1.1948,4.0449,0.1681,2.8601,1.0609,6.4194,7.6403,5.518,7.9776,1.5142,1.9436,5.7938,5.4591,3.9141,10.2294,0.0022,0.7982,1.256,2.4152,2.5607,2.1429,2.1561,2.9099,2.0061,7.7252,5.5592,5.5813,3.9533,0.9139,3.7649,1.4569,0.3485,0.3533,8.398,0.0056,1.543,6.043,3.1139,0.1469,2.0923,7.1696,3.4057,1.3068,11.0305,3.8791,6.2914,5.8841,2.9151,1.2894,0.5274,0.2662,1.4989,1.1349,1.3517,4.1436,2.0067,4.8143,3.8306,2.9412,0.7167,1.2747,4.9451,2.7555,1.6852,2.7786,4.1682,1.1478,4.8593,2.1392,1.5636,2.0211,1.5035,0.9933,1.658,5.1302,1.2063,0.2609,0.9872,5.1275,1.4544,3.7963,0.7617,0.4503,0.701,2.079,0.8657,1.4407,5.807,1.7983,3.3033,2.4753,0.3408,1.2858,1.8545,7.0657,1.6989,1.4433,6.7532,0.1335,0.0006,5.4145,1.2469,6.0679,2.569,2.0775,1.359,3.3716,1.9675,5.3632,0.0046,0.0397,2.3225,3.55,0.0004,1.7958,4.4642,7.008,1.4291]}

It centers on the northern Icewind Dale region, and is set thirty years after the events in Icewind Dale, the main Icewind Dale setting.\nForgotten Realms D&D - Icewind Dale II. This is where your character comes in. You pick a race, and from that, pick whatever class you want to play, because I play D&D: Dwarfs (and I got to pick a dwarven class in Icewind Dale 1 if any one remembers), Humans, elves, dwarf Elves, goblins, wizards, and even a little elf warrior (D&D is full of really cool races and classes which are a lot of fun, so it gives players a lot to work with). What\u2019s my best advice is to just pick a race and a class on the first adventure and see what you guys enjoy. My friends and I play the icewind Dale dungeons in order of Icewind Dale, Icewind Dale 2, and then Icewind Dale III, which are in that order. I just loved Icewind Dale (I am still playing it now) and I really enjoyed the game and the lore is amazing too. I haven\u2019t played in a while and don\u2019t remember much about Icewind Dale as it was but it must have been cool. I am not sure what edition Icewind Dale 2 is in, but I used Icewind Dale II (2nd edition) as part of Icewind Dale. And I have Icewind Dale 1 & 2 in my system. (I haven\u2019t actually read the book \u201cBook of the Shrine\u201d in the IWD series though ) I like IWD 2 more because it is more varied (and also the elves are cool). I also like that they have some of those cool Icewind Dale magic items from the Icewind Dale books, because they can actually be used in D&D.","token_len":410,"entropy":[10.1731,0.0423,5.9587,8.1986,0.5351,0.9096,1.3495,6.8017,0.4782,9.6703,9.3584,1.2822,6.7953,1.2382,1.4107,6.0834,0.7892,3.0893,0.0748,3.8972,0.0266,0.0295,0.0119,0.4269,2.7484,6.7456,0.8281,1.0386,7.7454,7.7878,0.0397,0.0615,4.8109,0.8528,1.8081,1.5706,1.97,7.5073,0.3857,0.7019,0.3061,0.6945,2.5762,5.3901,0.0098,0.0128,4.1842,2.3669,4.8594,5.4184,0.0393,0.075,4.1628,0.7646,0.9827,13.8575,2.3692,0.0235,1.7693,0.74,0.0018,5.6054,4.9568,0.0048,0.0224,0.3614,4.4997,3.4293,1.9049,5.8402,4.9698,2.1502,3.2373,2.5858,1.6498,2.1497,6.2475,1.5912,2.6655,0.9274,1.4584,5.5954,2.3755,3.6179,6.6556,6.1925,3.9343,0.6842,1.0928,0.6821,0.8894,2.4345,5.0824,5.3659,6.6704,3.5728,0.0212,0.0007,4.9188,7.6874,4.7472,3.9197,2.4838,2.1541,5.7321,2.2806,2.3633,1.9935,5.0041,0.0833,4.0505,3.3636,4.4827,0.0027,0.0631,5.2368,6.7928,6.8638,4.0145,6.9519,3.6626,4.4731,1.2439,4.6502,0.1479,6.1756,7.2943,0.2841,4.2194,0.1567,4.9064,0.1976,1.4466,3.1823,3.0965,3.4209,3.9566,6.8089,3.1653,5.4239,0.6324,0.0038,4.1681,4.1275,0.0887,6.9473,3.2175,4.1674,2.2717,1.6876,6.1477,1.808,4.5353,2.7547,1.7106,0.0621,2.4335,3.0157,3.1424,5.8882,5.8001,0.9173,1.2933,2.6422,3.0236,0.2414,0.9384,5.9364,16.7905,9.358,3.6136,6.2994,5.5214,3.724,2.044,0.6416,3.3745,2.1736,1.4066,0.569,1.529,5.8499,0.3657,5.8286,0.9877,3.0639,6.5299,3.1789,4.6604,0.6974,2.3915,5.9301,6.8846,0.7278,5.2089,5.0804,1.7522,0.1982,3.5079,2.7756,11.1195,5.0071,3.8227,5.9755,10.1539,2.5618,5.1999,3.5244,10.3858,0.0121,0.2454,2.0298,4.7875,0.1632,0.4465,2.0871,0.1888,0.9355,4.7589,1.7543,0.0016,0.1199,1.5246,1.761,2.1495,1.7596,3.8639,5.1413,0.1516,0.5295,2.4532,4.2009,7.1376,4.0361,0.0018,0.059,5.4005,3.0668,4.2966,3.8583,1.6119,0.9667,2.2515,1.8817,0.7218,1.8367,3.1128,1.4573,1.3428,4.4766,2.8522,1.8073,4.3265,6.9942,3.4037,4.1512,0.4089,2.1726,5.2643,3.7488,0.658,0.4199,0.8714,4.2908,1.6553,1.6586,1.6269,4.2579,0.2622,0.3687,0.063,3.7409,2.5296,0.7546,3.9199,0.0006,0.0306,4.5705,2.1004,1.8353,6.9034,1.9338,6.7657,0.6598,0.265,3.8304,1.8369,1.8547,3.7034,2.8922,1.0864,1.927,9.0261,5.1152,0.0009,0.0717,2.859,0.9203,2.8307,1.3085,0.3745,0.9277,7.029,3.7144,0.0047,0.136,2.0516,3.3039,5.1966,1.1137,1.3778,0.9341,2.7355,6.1174,0.0108,5.3541,0.0041,0.1652,2.8526,4.6482,1.5855,2.7358,6.6652,0.0011,0.0782,4.6597,6.3883,0.5396,2.092,0.9287,5.2765,1.7555,4.5359,1.7993,3.9028,0.2063,0.0576,0.0107,5.1708,4.007,1.2242,1.7252,9.2035,4.9488,8.8888,1.0868,1.3674,12.5595,2.5273,6.2179,5.0567,1.44,6.6027,4.3797,5.6732,5.4046,7.1095,2.1219,4.6352,6.3975,0.4927,3.5914,3.4598,2.7548,0.8279,1.4712,1.7627,5.6556,3.5972,1.7745,4.1525,3.6102,5.4478,1.3762,5.4174,2.1209,1.4908,2.6004,0.7783,2.2606,3.9845,1.5419,3.1614,2.9993,4.8222,4.5572,7.0441,0.0154,0.2814,5.3497,1.6565,4.1528,0.9196,4.2015,0.0529,0.1614,2.1953,1.8353,4.2049,1.722,3.5548,5.1557,1.8689,0.7974,1.4922,4.1294,0.0103,0.0017,1.4891]}

He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly accepted. He remained at the museum until 1904, when he was appointed Professor of Anthropology at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Mammology.\nIt was to the University of Cambridge that he was to return after one year as Keeper of the Anthropological Museum, the appointment having only been offered his second time here. It proved to be an ideal posting for him, as before working in the museum he had spent a large number of months investigating the tribes of the Tana basin in Southern Rhodesia. Returning to England he immediately worked on, amongst other things, the examination of the fossils from the Solenhofen, a huge deposit of fossil man that has been worked for over a century but little known until about a dozen years ago. A good deal of work on this deposit was continued, his first monograph being on the Man of Solenhofen ( 1908 ). The Solenhofen was a major discovery and Harmon Wheeler, after a long period of arduous work, was finally able to identify them as Australopithecus aethiopicus. The work with the fossil bones came before he had completed a Doctor of Medicine. He proceeded with his work on Solenhofen at Oxford and then returned to Cambridge where a number of papers dealing with Australopithecus were published ( e.g. 1920 ). His interest in the fossils was now joined by his own interest in the anatomy of primates, a period of which he wrote very clearly in his monograph on Primates ( 1956 ), where he wrote that although he had been chiefly concerned with the fossil remains of Australopithecus he had never abandoned the study of mammals. From 1907 until the year of his death in 1956, Wheeler taught at the University of Michigan.\nHarmon Wheeler died of heart disease at his home in Wimborne in September 1956, aged seventy-eight years.","token_len":411,"entropy":[2.2367,8.6243,0.1243,2.2107,11.4791,0.6929,0.7579,9.025,4.6504,0.7382,12.9702,9.2253,3.8922,1.7539,12.425,3.3251,5.9555,0.2022,6.1146,0.8711,1.9448,1.2881,1.8527,2.7919,1.3065,7.8464,2.2167,4.169,0.1499,3.0009,1.9641,1.7741,0.1315,1.7826,8.826,1.6539,1.5498,1.7102,5.4555,2.1037,1.0626,2.9392,0.9597,6.0468,0.8611,0.3132,0.6039,1.1198,2.1677,4.8573,0.1981,4.0394,0.8332,0.8053,0.3469,0.0469,3.4758,3.9473,1.6098,2.9116,0.005,7.8584,2.2942,0.6034,1.874,9.0148,0.7371,5.3511,3.005,4.755,0.3371,0.1122,0.7017,1.3282,2.061,4.0978,3.8514,3.6599,5.2956,0.5748,2.7025,7.2536,0.1174,0.1608,11.0706,0.2224,0.4631,2.0457,3.5349,6.8384,3.632,6.9699,0.3901,5.7102,7.4154,3.1971,1.2373,9.4094,0.895,3.1753,5.7569,0.6814,0.0723,1.9251,4.6155,9.5123,0.9179,1.1123,1.2048,1.4739,8.1536,7.7281,2.0739,0.9954,3.2022,1.7505,0.9309,3.2537,2.356,3.6068,3.985,0.005,3.3435,5.5953,1.2511,9.263,0.7062,1.21,6.2472,6.0965,8.9434,2.2276,6.0191,5.415,0.2401,0.8435,5.7213,0.5036,3.0932,1.7584,5.3808,5.0956,1.5849,6.7277,5.4723,0.2029,1.171,0.0506,0.9381,6.9949,0.0612,0.8784,5.5474,4.1144,0.5758,8.8331,11.2907,3.4907,3.5634,3.6535,2.6024,5.4686,4.3243,0.8535,3.9866,8.0091,5.5918,2.9966,0.6863,8.6623,3.5196,2.0707,1.5692,0.6969,5.8178,6.2447,3.9493,4.9644,6.1266,3.6668,3.8341,0.132,0.3932,0.2795,4.5356,5.4335,1.5249,0.1099,1.2981,2.7446,1.3159,4.6431,1.6725,6.1221,2.8477,6.3233,3.7769,8.6233,0.1539,2.2592,3.5522,0.5496,6.0088,4.4207,8.1593,0.0633,0.0072,0.0177,3.2369,11.5721,1.1355,2.4936,5.9144,0.0042,0.0022,0.0127,2.5794,1.8164,4.5745,3.2166,2.6654,10.718,6.7461,2.7694,3.5261,2.1576,1.7517,2.6263,0.2404,6.3883,0.0024,1.314,0.6227,1.61,1.9183,0.6247,0.0291,6.4743,4.942,2.8835,6.9307,0.2009,0.0291,0.0931,4.8276,5.047,0.4413,2.5416,1.1341,2.2673,4.0746,5.7564,2.0505,3.4479,4.8031,5.7535,7.4293,2.5685,2.572,4.0062,3.8366,8.9121,2.6368,4.5402,2.2889,1.9126,5.9837,2.7851,1.861,1.7062,1.3411,4.2016,0.0014,0.0012,0.0059,3.936,3.859,2.2597,3.253,3.4867,0.1357,2.3788,2.8985,5.6803,2.4111,0.0021,4.5749,6.0574,0.0265,5.2584,0.0055,0.0033,0.0036,1.377,0.6886,3.9665,6.0225,0.3379,0.0369,0.3285,9.0308,2.1001,3.6139,3.9206,0.2989,0.8572,2.7224,1.4917,5.5382,8.1,0.322,1.5461,4.2537,1.2773,0.0691,0.8807,4.7329,0.3118,5.7643,1.6631,3.6448,6.2696,1.7007,4.1738,0.2693,5.0483,5.0194,4.6666,1.5118,0.6832,3.6629,0.3109,1.4861,6.5059,0.5879,1.3092,6.4717,3.4679,3.5429,0.1522,3.4401,2.0419,5.214,1.9036,0.9806,2.1545,7.8905,2.1526,0.1313,0.7775,4.3515,3.4125,0.4994,2.4549,0.0123,0.0017,0.0015,2.0965,0.9516,3.4587,7.1612,0.9235,3.261,0.0766,5.1222,0.8862,5.3867,7.0133,3.0718,2.5301,3.7661,3.3244,0.1907,0.3688,2.1149,5.8962,1.0644,4.9242,6.4225,1.8243,1.145,0.8242,0.0551,7.1207,2.1456,1.5828,3.2176,0.1618,0.0026,1.418,4.2528,3.0366,3.3748,2.7083,1.7882,2.1146,0.26,0.2845,9.499,1.6875,2.7,4.1685,4.6527,1.8765,1.2772,5.6184,0.2262,2.5114,2.1553,0.5128]}

An attempt was made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. The series was presented by actor William Bendall. In 1964, the first of a number of television revivals ran. Another series began running in the mid-1980s.\nAs part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the First World War, several re-runs of the film in 2000\u20132001 were produced for television in America. It was also recently rediscovered by Hollywood after having been on a shelf for 80 years. In 2016, it appeared on the BBC Worldwide channel's block of \"Return of the Spies\" specials.\n\nRelease\n\nThe original release was for the US and Canada by Paramount Pictures and released on 9 July, 1927 and 8 January 1928 respectively. Two feature length films were originally planned but the budget was never paid off. Following the success of the first film, Paramount Pictures produced a number of features during the early years. Between 1933 and 1930, three short feature films entitled The Return of the Bulldog Drummond Spies were made which did not have any substantial screen time, as the series was still airing daily.\nParamount Pictures produced a one-hour television film called BULLDOG DRUMMOND BACK IN ACTION, airing on 3 February 1954.

hats.\nIt was the early 1970s also that he discovered The Beatles and the Beatles album Let It Be.By the late 1960s, he had given up work in the retail industry entirely\nThe Beatles had long been at the centre of David Goldston's life, but it was Let It Be that would eventually lead him to turn his life's direction entirely.\nHe began to photograph the band in 1973 and the photographs became part of his'human billboard'series.In February 1975, after the release of the documentary The Beatles documentary, Goldston became a fan of the band and decided to go on a series of photo tours of British concerts, beginning in Manchester and concluding in Liverpool in March 1976.\nA short while later, the Beatles tour in America began and Goldston was able to travel to Washington and New York to photograph the band.But it wasn't until David Goldston started selling the photos to the television station BBC who began to broadcast regular television programmes based on his photos.This was soon followed by numerous feature documentaries and a booklet of 50 of his images - An Incredible Story of Britain's Rolling Stones.\nGoldston's photos were taken mostly away from the group's stage settings and from the audience in order to focus exclusively on the band, but not in a way that detracted from the musical performance's overall message.\nThe booklet of 50 of Goldston's photos was soon sold to an exhibition gallery in Montreal where it remains to this day.","token_len":412,"entropy":[8.9769,2.4826,5.8306,1.9597,4.9866,5.6016,1.2966,4.1932,0.8296,1.8646,0.0032,6.6845,0.6047,9.4683,3.1455,8.186,3.918,5.8034,9.411,1.7099,8.0063,1.4078,4.5282,16.5476,8.3797,6.3357,7.5772,10.1336,9.3669,8.9413,0.8219,0.4136,3.7861,8.4485,0.6886,10.3417,8.0778,7.4876,2.4869,2.1609,3.4702,5.2787,8.5947,3.628,3.2202,2.2077,2.7581,6.2973,2.6087,4.2518,7.1123,2.6785,3.2906,0.8178,5.0207,5.7573,2.0795,1.1437,1.9417,6.8525,1.8168,0.0638,0.3346,0.3331,1.8536,1.3871,5.8098,5.4268,3.8835,0.076,6.7682,4.5505,6.1056,4.9911,2.5369,0.745,6.1246,1.1314,4.5358,0.1432,2.3612,1.7926,2.1355,0.2351,7.7714,2.2324,2.7993,0.2508,4.5676,1.8332,0.0023,0.0007,5.3129,2.2549,2.2129,5.0774,0.0508,4.7299,6.2883,8.6427,1.8539,15.3178,6.6463,2.3545,0.2537,4.8455,1.3131,0.93,7.0273,5.7158,6.2636,5.8989,11.8764,4.7793,8.5719,1.4446,3.5642,8.1998,0.8396,3.6703,4.3403,2.1471,0.0782,8.4695,1.585,1.2724,3.9846,5.1941,4.4065,2.6182,2.6782,2.7713,5.9763,8.0038,0.6302,0.7456,1.2308,7.2673,1.248,2.1985,3.3341,0.0387,0.8588,1.3678,1.0496,5.8889,0.3437,5.5206,2.4738,1.6061,5.9734,1.5513,5.4657,7.7107,3.4489,2.3653,2.4138,4.7301,0.9693,4.3266,0.4717,1.2877,0.0079,7.288,7.3244,6.5454,0.0979,1.9668,1.1248,2.2626,3.2867,0.4264,11.8133,0.1015,0.0006,0.9055,5.1578,3.9624,2.214,1.0845,0.4194,6.5835,0.5293,2.9032,5.8103,8.5375,7.2853,1.2927,2.6969,2.2365,2.7755,2.2944,6.0517,1.8834,2.7065,1.7695,4.1573,2.4534,3.4704,4.4939,2.8402,3.106,0.0207,0.9945,10.2845,9.262,1.2341,6.2084,12.2374,1.2305,4.6691,5.8737,2.5744,0.401,3.8791,2.8997,2.6515,0.0282,1.9023,4.957,3.0266,0.8761,7.6106,1.1559,1.4302,0.006,3.6355,2.1804,4.628,0.467,0.8301,0.8745,1.2533,3.7666,0.144,4.1037,1.8606,0.9775,5.252,0.17,4.6799,4.0452,2.9595,5.9323,6.2166,2.1187,5.2002,1.2264,4.9614,2.2326,5.2288,0.1992,2.8904,2.5392,3.2324,1.0095,0.1852,0.7929,3.7537,4.0465,1.9608,0.3061,0.4707,3.0204,3.1099,4.4067,3.9234,5.1193,1.6947,2.0115,1.2969,0.0021,2.2075,2.6261,0.0119,3.1857,0.6603,4.0768,3.6018,3.6978,0.0611,1.2591,2.0514,0.8766,1.6011,1.7902,7.2265,2.9365,1.9783,0.0196,0.4211,8.8362,0.4512,0.0126,3.9446,5.7585,2.3082,3.6843,2.2425,1.9334,8.1955,2.8438,3.258,6.889,2.7556,1.1972,4.0362,8.3315,4.4027,2.5422,6.0599,0.2075,1.8551,3.3407,1.0885,5.2905,1.8707,4.4314,0.3577,0.0939,4.7387,5.6602,3.9497,1.9425,2.4775,7.3444,3.1283,4.4431,3.6052,1.4516,3.9005,4.6905,8.4639,5.8962,3.0733,0.3981,5.6134,0.5788,6.8389,0.0639,1.5588,1.0644,2.0621,0.0068,1.7365,3.8474,1.5578,3.3529,5.7195,7.7885,0.0401,0.6826,5.5048,0.9807,4.9101,8.5925,1.5424,5.769,1.0418,3.3776,3.176,4.7455,0.0658,3.7169,5.6759,0.0323,0.6869,1.5141,2.5518,1.9802,5.613,2.935,1.8455,2.5744,0.2847,9.8265,0.027,0.048,0.6806,6.0812,3.7539,6.5184,4.8227,1.9228,0.4034,0.8111,2.3287,6.8474,2.8375,0.3973,2.1828,1.3405,0.0168,0.0569,1.5991,1.4761,5.2964,3.9142,0.7917,4.6549,4.9842,5.073,1.1287,6.6642,3.4293,0.856,5.3398,2.3015,0.0478,0.0152,0.4428]}

He described the editing process using the editor\u2019s tool panel (one of the characters, played by Jason Bateman, uses an icon similar to a screen editing tool to select the shots that the viewer will see during subsequent episodes and when he is editing the episode for the first time).","token_len":413,"entropy":[7.7499,3.4733,0.2886,3.4704,6.3052,8.3963,1.2826,1.9684,1.013,7.0402,6.8824,3.8709,2.5461,12.0029,4.7759,4.1375,10.3872,6.616,3.1474,5.4237,4.0375,0.1706,1.4273,4.9769,0.9572,3.2946,2.8967,4.1795,0.3103,2.1407,0.3063,1.743,3.5483,8.2846,0.8289,0.9433,1.9553,3.04,3.7993,6.9363,4.7035,1.1168,0.2371,2.3754,1.4511,2.3788,3.1807,2.1488,1.6264,6.9211,1.7789,6.3981,3.4656,0.4024,0.2784,4.0653,2.8271,5.0419,2.8359,6.2055,0.0021,1.2428,0.2898,2.471,2.1879,2.7272,2.05,4.9316,0.0233,0.6018,6.5371,13.3709,7.126,5.673,4.9523,6.8532,0.0947,0.9386,2.7654,2.4258,5.1576,1.8379,4.8116,0.3755,1.4267,5.8254,1.7163,0.4525,0.4242,2.5175,1.134,1.7703,5.0185,8.1989,3.9682,0.5341,0.9041,6.8432,1.0611,0.7915,5.7937,4.732,5.4106,4.8474,3.5856,1.6949,10.4441,5.857,9.6245,10.2917,1.3621,1.0076,4.5041,2.2476,7.2557,1.6734,5.0211,5.2841,0.0165,2.9063,2.8021,4.852,6.6915,1.4805,6.0152,4.0421,0.032,0.1625,0.7886,4.4696,4.8835,0.0057,2.1659,5.1249,0.7116,3.2773,0.1221,1.1258,2.1176,2.1746,0.799,0.5358,1.5782,3.0306,1.8626,1.2987,11.7179,2.1749,2.5911,0.0237,0.2312,0.3428,1.4058,6.4619,0.1465,0.0611,0.0065,3.4777,0.197,0.5959,1.1263,1.0184,1.8324,0.6074,4.6394,0.0005,1.3409,3.1892,0.9156,4.5868,3.0364,2.9517,0.0425,5.8755,0.0014,1.605,1.5344,0.0509,0.3163,4.3947,4.5472,0.6924,1.582,1.488,1.546,5.0121,3.0623,1.251,5.6946,2.2903,3.6263,0.4834,2.2508,2.8713,8.552,0.2117,5.3524,3.1858,8.0021,0.0007,2.0149,3.0557,4.2956,0.6426,7.8903,0.7422,4.1091,3.6943,5.5312,0.8488,2.2687,0.2277,4.2996,0.6339,1.8011,1.9772,10.3151,1.5351,0.2899,1.2659,0.1171,6.9961,2.037,2.9572,0.1352,4.0193,0.4035,1.0466,1.0608,0.3104,0.267,5.0963,0.1054,1.41,2.9114,12.9712,0.0277,0.0727,7.2913,2.3507,3.8268,0.2252,0.4178,1.4556,2.6259,6.909,0.0075,0.0302,2.7673,7.4024,4.7443,2.4586,0.9944,4.0135,8.5523,2.7567,2.0522,4.021,0.7303,4.8491,4.7387,3.7024,5.2786,4.4351,1.2686,5.2226,3.983,6.9963,4.5974,2.8541,1.318,3.2613,3.6724,4.5491,0.9643,0.8393,1.1696,1.311,1.958,2.4855,0.0038,0.0105,2.5555,0.4418,3.1532,0.014,8.4068,3.731,0.847,1.3675,5.6521,1.0194,3.298,0.0739,1.1218,6.1832,2.9297,1.1352,4.9801,8.704,3.1658,0.0252,0.3909,4.0146,1.8568,0.8234,3.8828,2.4512,0.0466,0.031,0.0148,0.7085,3.7612,4.5985,1.4308,3.6414,5.3621,6.6868,2.6123,2.5549,1.312,6.7247,5.0755,0.5321,3.4315,1.6293,5.3333,0.001,0.5587,1.7309,0.0064,0.0087,2.7424,0.8344,1.9031,2.783,2.9957,4.4376,4.9124,3.4029,0.5685,3.7529,5.0681,3.433,2.4877,4.7777,5.0037,0.0822,4.8993,1.256,3.4925,3.5758,3.9053,1.1235,2.2998,3.4211,1.139,5.7947,0.2377,6.1732,2.243,7.4328,8.4549,0.0581,0.0257,4.5495,8.9784,4.1669,6.0471,0.4762,0.736,6.5013,3.2995,6.6989,0.0123,4.4143,0.3363,0.0018,0.3246,6.2182,3.2142,8.1958,5.5846,0.0114,1.7332,5.8208,9.2248,0.3777,2.9571,3.9429,1.2915,5.2761,1.9998,3.8779,2.116,1.9855,0.4508,4.327,8.0441,3.6325,4.5506,5.0229,2.9725,2.2626,6.0119,1.972,3.006,4.592,1.0684,1.2609,0.0364,0.6673]}

Professionally, and to secure funds to buy his house in the Forest of Dean, he began to take classes at Wroxham School, a boarding school in Norfolk. His tutors included Roger Benson, Michael Scott, and the family who ran the school for ten years. He became a director on the school council and also tutored pupils. He retired in 2002 but continued to be involved with children, both on the school council and volunteering. He was made a director of the school in 1997.\nOlivier made up plays for the staff of Wroxham. The school was so impressed that it asked a group of drama students to write a play for him. This was The Prince and the Pauper, a story written in 1986 on the life of Sir Roger Fry, who had fought the Battle of Maldon in the Battle of Jutland for Britain. The play was given at the Royal Opera House in 2002. The producers of Wroxham asked him to re-teach the School\u2019s classes after his retirement, giving two classes a week.

The Leopard 2 programme also included a design build contract for a new main battle tank, to be delivered mid - 96, for the German army  which was eventually cancelled due to a heavy delay in manufacturing the vehicle. During this period the two Leopards had been used to demonstrate their performance to the Bundeswehr. During this time the two ex-Daimler Leopards were sold to the US Army and named'Cougars '. They were put to the battlefield and tested, however it was later determined that the British had better artillery and other infantry support, therefore the US Army returned the machines. The Leopard 2E is also in service with Thailand and in addition with other African countries.\nThe two vehicles have since been part of the Bundeswehr museum, and both are displayed at the Leopard 2 Museum in Scharffenberg, Bavaria.\nIn 1993, a US company named PCL ordered a similar machine to the two Leopard 2E vehicles. This company, later acquired by the US Government (now General Dynamics), built a similar version from the chassis. The machine is known as the Leopard 2A3 in the US, and is a production of the original, Leopard 2E.

In the same year, he sold the majority of lands in his province, but in 1643, he acquired a considerable amount of lands near Zabrze and Kruszowice in the south-western part.\nIn 1646 Jeremi married Anna \u017burowska (1593\u20131647 ) of the \u017burowska branch of the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family, with whom he had at least fourteen children, and both lived at \u017bu\u0142awice. The couple had nine sons and five daughters.\nIn 1648, Jeremi was awarded the land of Podolia and the city of Tarnopol, with the right to bear the name.\nIn 1648, in order to gain greater control over the southern borderlands, the Polish-Ukrainian alliance, known as the Alliance, established a system of military rulers along the borderland of Lower Silesia and Galicia, with Jeremi being one of the nine governors appointed for the provinces of Lower Silesia and Galicia.\nUnfortunately, the Alliance was dissolved in 1650 due to the conflict between Russia and Poland that resulted in the invasion of Poland by the Swedish Army.\nJeremi took his duties as a governor seriously and fought successfully in the war against the Russians, with the assistance of the Polish forces of Grand Duke of Lithuania Jan III Sobieski.\nIn the course of his career, Jeremi suffered the injury of a blow to the head, which weakened his eyesight considerably and ultimately led to blindness.\nIn 1668, Jeremi died aged 72 years, and was buried at his estate near Zabrze, where he had lived for his whole life.","token_len":416,"entropy":[8.0165,5.094,0.3277,4.626,1.6527,3.0833,0.0157,1.9063,4.1477,11.3227,0.6024,8.2553,10.6807,3.83,1.0577,5.6549,9.1745,3.1603,0.4202,0.2897,11.8286,2.4239,4.7562,1.4219,4.4369,8.3692,3.6977,2.6139,1.1681,8.5454,0.0198,0.0005,0.1809,1.0885,0.7541,0.1837,0.2911,2.9407,6.5423,3.4893,1.5308,4.4387,5.2634,1.5916,0.9411,5.3682,2.5948,5.8323,3.4265,5.1144,3.785,0.9454,2.0544,4.8509,2.0398,3.6184,3.8307,6.0686,1.2598,10.1675,0.2236,4.1103,3.0113,1.6077,4.3681,6.7953,2.4594,0.6593,0.3388,2.9364,2.7929,3.7107,0.093,0.2739,2.4565,5.2823,1.2748,4.8638,0.0588,6.427,1.1541,3.0389,6.3873,1.8884,3.5499,3.2663,1.1859,2.8911,1.5088,1.8885,5.3097,2.0479,4.6625,1.3989,0.0661,3.5622,4.5686,4.2702,4.2393,2.7697,2.7498,5.2823,7.5881,4.6718,0.6603,4.2374,5.4949,1.6698,1.5126,3.8741,1.3905,1.3243,0.8487,6.2398,1.6695,9.318,0.5327,2.4158,2.9967,0.0031,3.1398,2.5777,4.5197,1.7613,4.6992,8.7342,1.4492,3.4931,4.7925,3.8891,1.1782,0.1547,3.9809,10.9647,2.0051,1.552,2.4561,0.2498,0.4814,0.4856,0.1434,7.6806,0.4701,0.1828,8.683,1.637,3.5122,1.8664,6.1259,6.9388,5.0347,0.886,4.4938,0.1983,0.1336,0.6154,7.1568,1.6121,5.5813,0.0872,1.7737,1.6921,6.5283,3.0624,3.1116,3.1824,0.2062,0.4192,5.1767,4.8867,2.3462,1.7899,2.4792,2.4452,1.4934,4.413,3.0141,1.1122,2.2155,0.0154,1.2211,1.6643,1.3347,0.2882,1.6465,0.7188,1.8086,0.0011,2.3488,4.8777,0.5088,7.1679,0.5881,6.9114,6.3078,3.2104,2.1674,5.3338,0.1201,4.461,4.4221,4.6837,1.5889,3.5739,0.9647,4.5794,0.6002,6.3392,1.6026,3.0549,5.5142,2.6029,0.8988,0.3404,2.4006,0.5093,3.0684,2.133,0.0455,3.7991,5.3336,1.4895,0.3993,0.6196,7.5078,3.571,2.9664,0.7924,1.6493,1.5533,4.762,5.0231,0.0074,0.005,3.8376,2.6699,4.9801,0.108,0.2059,4.8099,4.303,3.4013,0.9197,4.4286,0.1885,3.9153,7.3889,6.2146,0.1732,2.2797,3.652,3.0136,9.445,4.558,0.2658,0.0162,1.7438,7.5591,0.0413,1.4708,2.5776,7.71,0.0025,3.264,2.9489,0.0395,0.7965,6.6626,4.0143,4.8127,3.7892,1.211,6.1175,1.6509,2.6953,0.2204,0.0012,0.0021,0.5269,0.3536,0.0006,0.2907,1.4365,8.1811,0.4734,1.506,3.7824,1.9325,3.767,0.8733,0.3848,2.0873,4.6386,0.0082,1.2176,4.7127,0.6911,5.484,0.1042,1.5425,4.1323,2.8249,0.2051,0.519,6.1401,0.1688,1.2068,1.491,0.6118,7.6401,3.1855,0.9235,1.4091,3.4547,0.0021,4.6512,2.6572,6.912,1.1439,1.3806,2.5426,5.0752,1.8051,6.2936,5.7549,1.6283,0.7658,2.0407,0.8978,0.6832,2.5109,1.6119,4.0351,1.5558,3.207,0.0188,1.6212,1.7496,4.6649,4.3,6.2253,0.8805,3.5415,6.5743,6.8709,10.7895,6.9607,1.4815,0.0826,1.1938,1.5697,1.0691,2.401,3.9178,0.0006,1.915,2.3829,0.2317,0.6379,0.0006,5.5681,4.635,6.0875,0.1048,1.3108,4.7402,0.7375,0.6796,0.8743,1.9528,1.5061,6.8744,0.3668,5.1866,0.2126,4.7356,1.7314,5.4337,2.5661,0.2381,2.5083,0.5772,1.636,1.1729,0.4578,4.9571,0.2457,1.2963,0.0009,2.7788,4.1424,4.2258,3.8376,1.7762,1.7467,3.3857,0.2459,1.433,3.2648,2.8758,2.1005,2.1233,0.8271,0.0277,0.0205,1.3818,1.8938,0.3516,2.2332,2.8759,0.621,5.2339,2.14,0.1055,0.3075]}

He then won the Grand Slam doubles title in 1999 and won a total of 11 singles and doubles events.\nOn 29 May 2004, in his first and only appearance at the All England Club, in the first round against Frenchman Gilles Simon, Federer became the youngest ATP Tour player ever to play a slam final. He lost 7\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20137 (5\u20137), and 6\u20134 to Simon. His loss to Simon is also considered the one match that shaped his tennis style. The next year, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, Federer lost to then unseeded Dusan Lajovic from Croatia. Federer was ranked number 3 in World tennis and won a total of 15 singles events during his career in 2005. In 2010, he won a record breaking 31 tennis events, including winning the U.S. Open. His most impressive win was in Australian Open in 2011, beating Novak Djokovic in the final. Federer also won another five titles in 2011 at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.\nFederer said that the U.S. Open in 1999 was his first championship event. He also said that although he had won both of his singles majors that year, the U.S. Open was what turned him into a star tennis player.

Due to this , early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of","text":"Tonin\u00e1 had a particularly active Early Classic presence, although the Early Classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction. Due to this, early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of Tonina ( the earliest written reference to the archaeological site comes from the mid-fifth century BCE ).\nThe Early Classic archaeological sites of Tonina are known from the first centuries BC although the development of the later settlements is not known to that extent, The earliest Early Classical buildings are also those first known from excavations and consist of terrace settlements, a square-shaped plan. These early buildings are situated in between the Early Classical cemeteries. The early texts suggest that there was also a connection with the Mycenaeans, although this has been contested in later chronicles which relate to the Greek War of Independence, There are no signs of a connection in the archaeological record with Mycenaean sites.\nThe development of the settlement is illustrated by the Late Bronze Age remains and finds. These suggest an expansion of the settlement, perhaps to protect the town from the sea and to have a more secure position compared to its Early Classic predecessor.\nIn the fourth century there is a change in settlement layout with a reduction in size and only one plan being known. The site is surrounded by a stone wall and terraces built on the sides of the highest points. The city is situated near the river Sava, a river that runs through the town. Tonin\u00e1 becomes the main centre for the Sikani, the people of the Sava valley. In the later fourth and the third century Tonin\u00e1 becomes the main centre of the Ionian Greek speaking world. The city's importance is further confirmed by the many literary references about Tonin\u00e1 and its Roman connections. The city's population is estimated to have been around 1500 inhabitants in the third century.\nIt appears that the city is still connected to Mycenaean influences, with at least two texts relating to the city's wealth and the fact that it belongs to the wealthy Greek cities.","token_len":417,"entropy":[6.0026,10.4842,6.8236,3.0824,5.814,6.4425,11.6787,5.5382,8.6737,1.8419,4.7069,2.7194,6.8305,0.4834,5.0307,16.0191,6.3657,3.9303,3.106,9.2579,8.3958,0.7065,7.1066,0.0301,2.93,0.8095,5.0916,7.0623,2.5436,4.6783,1.5372,4.5287,7.9336,1.8042,3.0725,0.6881,0.9901,2.6685,2.9396,0.1327,9.6635,7.5953,3.9104,9.5823,3.6753,4.3663,4.4263,0.3446,1.2365,8.4636,1.3337,4.7748,0.0713,1.2814,5.5066,0.3552,6.6234,0.0451,2.4838,3.074,1.3042,3.3926,3.2327,0.4728,7.4846,3.1792,2.1575,0.4046,0.0674,1.5324,4.7671,1.9384,1.7053,3.9971,3.3609,2.3663,8.0232,1.8016,6.3466,0.1115,1.2706,5.7558,5.9706,2.3138,2.2413,1.9786,3.6254,5.3926,1.3846,3.2451,8.0509,2.0107,5.8157,3.2938,6.158,1.9021,4.4906,7.6917,7.7521,2.2396,1.6433,6.5842,0.0546,3.665,8.5796,0.5243,6.36,3.1218,6.9185,1.7937,3.5443,6.5215,3.0633,1.1226,7.2618,6.4251,2.6358,3.4176,1.5651,1.4753,4.343,1.2705,5.9724,1.2263,6.6976,1.4465,6.7768,2.0518,0.0185,0.0002,4.2071,1.4088,3.3342,6.1863,5.1273,0.2547,3.3798,1.6408,4.7555,0.5246,7.4474,2.3212,0.5964,8.5388,1.3266,0.0303,0.0222,3.6948,1.2804,4.0791,1.8382,3.7069,1.5079,3.8663,2.8958,4.1687,6.3185,0.6925,5.0707,6.2545,1.5478,0.649,6.5088,7.6808,1.1256,3.1007,2.6299,9.9246,1.2376,2.4367,5.6195,0.2608,2.1337,2.3675,3.8578,0.5568,5.5638,1.2888,2.0959,5.0693,0.0224,0.0094,0.0074,0.8816,3.3407,0.941,1.1464,1.1714,6.0536,0.0439,0.5415,4.1245,3.896,5.7774,0.4381,0.662,5.6612,2.063,0.1952,7.2888,4.4683,4.9755,2.591,2.0572,4.9322,4.1446,4.5212,0.3065,0.3384,1.8662,2.2732,4.6832,3.5633,7.4213,0.8333,5.7534,0.7776,1.8113,6.1321,1.72,1.9764,5.7243,1.589,3.1081,3.8996,3.0712,5.164,0.2538,3.1451,4.8959,1.8995,5.224,0.3193,1.7493,3.234,1.2924,6.1336,0.4256,7.8487,1.29,1.1596,4.5013,0.5555,3.7705,4.7458,3.5055,2.3299,5.5882,0.3947,4.5406,1.3428,7.7507,2.8955,6.79,6.5006,4.2769,1.7426,1.1734,4.0545,1.3569,3.9632,0.1145,1.4095,5.401,1.6892,1.788,6.1174,2.8374,4.952,1.8888,1.5177,3.8965,0.9503,0.8439,8.339,4.1764,1.2946,1.0188,5.5855,1.3414,3.407,4.2611,0.6843,3.0334,5.2817,3.5929,1.5121,2.8891,3.0981,1.3588,2.3719,1.1533,0.3696,1.966,0.9154,6.7243,4.2777,0.0394,7.429,1.2101,3.4091,4.0172,2.3625,1.1639,13.0614,6.1541,2.914,1.8135,3.5988,0.4123,0.9153,5.7086,0.1243,2.9403,0.8067,3.4198,1.0326,4.6012,5.4918,2.9718,6.8474,4.6942,3.236,6.644,0.4309,0.0096,1.9633,1.0355,2.1161,1.3115,1.3782,0.4141,5.4124,3.843,7.0128,8.6126,3.8885,0.6618,1.5037,2.2754,3.1713,4.8339,1.9583,2.548,3.912,0.4005,0.4109,6.6768,7.3657,3.4622,4.8782,2.8297,0.3988,0.0154,2.2554,1.0318,5.9597,5.8881,0.6118,1.81,2.4864,1.668,5.2977,1.3326,1.263,0.7705,0.7056,1.2235,1.2574,5.0278,5.0936,2.5714,0.526,3.1378,0.4211,2.7429,1.1008,4.4374,4.2015,0.2354,0.7671,2.1478,3.2522,3.2589,3.225,0.6417,5.7331,0.0223,0.0167,0.0099,0.5989,6.0544,1.6962,3.2524,5.8265,0.0359,1.9015,5.9463,2.8538,0.1969,0.6462,2.3927,1.8441,7.4775,0.8347,3.0782,5.0829,0.0324,1.6513,6.8618,0.0287,0.6973,8.043,4.0917,5.3172,1.5672]}

Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air show demonstrations. During the final turn, he broke the sound barrier to get a good view of the crowd. Holland made his final descent to the base of the tower at over 8,000 f t with speed just under 120 mph. The aircraft was then flown around the base of the tower and landed at 3 p.m. The crowd cheered.\nIn the second air show, a week later in Washington. Holland demonstrated the same performance profile and landed at 3.30 p.m. He performed the reverse turn profile on his final approach and got a good view of the crowd. The aircraft had been flown at nearly 120 mph over the Washington DC suburbs and dropped over 500 feet in the final run. The descent speed was over 90 mph over the final 500 feet.\nThe third and fourth air shows were to be on the flight deck of MacDonnell Douglas DC4 Air Force One and MacDonnell Douglas DC2 aircraft, respectively, in New York. Holland successfully demonstrated a 360\u00b0 turn around the flight deck of the Air Force One at night, where the traffic control tower was visible for several miles. He did not manage to break the sound barrier at the second attempt at night. He also performed the same profile at night on the flight deck of the DC2 aircraft in New York, with a successful demonstration.\nOn 25 June 1941, Holland made the last of the three final tours of presentation of his aircraft, in Miami. He turned the plane around at night where the radar was visible. There was a brief demonstration of the reverse turn over and descent. This was on the first attempt by Holland.\nThe USAAF did not give Holland his request for the assignment and as a result did not support his efforts in air shows. His aircraft were eventually stored in the Los Angeles area after the war.

The show received positive reviews from television critics.

He said that \"though the episode takes place as a series' last chapter, it's a chapter the writers have been working on for several seasons now. That's not to say that its end (or that of their story) is necessarily foreboding. The series has shown a passion for a complex, unpredictable human condition and has repeatedly demonstrated willingness to make it the dominant storyline.\"","token_len":419,"entropy":[8.8918,7.0349,3.4321,6.0382,7.6102,0.0137,8.4921,0.9035,0.3137,3.0268,0.0527,0.7405,8.0982,9.4552,2.3844,8.9381,9.2788,4.3351,12.3532,6.0722,8.1382,5.6329,5.369,1.6621,0.6156,5.3634,0.1157,2.3503,0.0024,0.6423,2.0157,9.8671,1.5711,2.0146,0.4789,3.2034,1.3577,9.7057,6.7125,3.0824,1.7195,2.5854,1.8195,6.3819,5.6987,0.4436,0.0722,0.6684,3.682,1.1789,1.5546,6.0874,6.0295,3.2935,2.0435,3.941,4.2756,2.7685,7.1113,5.0946,2.1412,2.2417,9.3015,4.8997,2.2764,1.5374,4.8286,1.3644,3.5893,1.2387,9.9601,3.3896,8.1383,0.5893,0.0973,4.7428,7.264,1.0299,2.1132,1.6127,1.1264,5.0201,1.5969,7.5212,3.7243,4.9952,10.6139,0.5663,0.0268,1.3217,3.9604,1.6283,2.0054,2.2777,1.6208,6.5576,2.612,2.9835,2.8847,0.0038,3.9007,5.5034,3.4659,0.5121,1.7189,3.045,1.6551,2.7057,2.1805,2.8431,0.0989,6.0206,1.728,5.6167,4.879,0.045,1.1667,4.1436,1.2293,2.8675,0.781,1.2903,9.3064,7.7152,6.583,0.0014,2.5354,3.9599,3.0697,1.6636,4.3787,2.3682,4.1702,2.8127,3.1371,2.1264,3.8819,1.9634,3.016,7.5159,2.1726,4.4065,4.5293,0.1122,0.1726,2.0172,2.4275,2.6362,4.608,1.5058,1.5797,1.8012,2.056,2.4174,3.2735,0.4941,0.8814,1.3838,3.9161,4.8067,5.4919,2.488,3.0382,4.5492,1.175,1.671,1.2431,0.1912,0.095,0.3472,0.1489,1.4951,2.4594,3.1275,9.4592,4.1543,2.8647,15.1797,7.8134,4.0371,1.9779,1.7532,0.7669,0.9322,1.7266,2.8683,0.2449,0.8939,6.2993,6.7968,11.7488,2.0745,1.5217,0.7756,6.1524,4.4512,2.9323,0.162,3.0553,4.8401,1.4386,0.576,0.6472,2.8692,2.698,1.6831,4.0738,2.4453,1.0448,3.0906,2.7109,6.0012,0.5623,4.6308,5.0666,0.0033,3.7336,3.0077,1.1588,8.8843,8.9839,0.24,0.0074,0.5433,4.0014,3.842,1.7137,4.6928,1.062,2.5825,1.3367,0.8915,4.4243,1.3984,1.1495,0.0656,4.4725,2.1529,0.0021,0.2641,1.5512,4.6937,0.0638,6.7492,0.4877,2.2595,5.6994,3.5884,6.4627,0.6583,4.8067,2.7185,1.5116,1.6855,2.9785,1.7466,3.3048,0.3957,0.9579,9.2568,0.6235,3.2923,6.7615,5.6091,0.2929,6.6186,1.1876,0.8468,4.5585,3.8584,0.0369,2.027,1.279,1.1456,0.7306,1.5896,0.4657,5.582,1.0433,5.322,0.2025,1.8392,4.0921,3.023,2.0544,3.2847,9.6321,1.2255,2.7946,0.9161,1.2625,11.4776,3.4137,0.9281,5.9025,3.9899,2.4269,2.0131,6.6442,1.3868,1.0373,2.3293,2.5482,6.9994,0.6818,2.073,6.8694,2.2493,1.8935,2.8294,0.3625,0.0615,0.2359,4.2851,6.9323,2.4219,2.3863,5.0267,2.5289,0.476,4.3199,4.3204,1.4054,0.9441,0.465,0.609,4.6614,0.1042,1.9362,0.7412,5.5514,3.5774,5.2249,2.051,10.1827,6.3295,4.5329,1.718,0.874,4.0085,1.5527,2.9584,2.1839,0.5267,1.4732,7.4874,1.4834,1.6054,6.0116,1.2186,5.102,1.1844,4.3018,6.8423,3.8995,5.5436,0.5924,0.9432,1.586,2.2732,5.227,4.9333,2.9954,1.9074,1.929,2.066,0.5772,0.8497,4.3628,1.3107,2.4401,1.7743,4.1054,1.1359,2.7775,0.9412,0.0566,0.7164,4.6714,5.1217,5.457,1.4733,3.5217,2.2588,6.0004,3.9395,0.3406,0.8016,3.2382,5.6951,3.6935,0.0055,1.7366,2.096,4.102,2.1553,4.6354,2.83,7.0456,0.1651,4.3622,6.3875,2.0789,4.6854,5.8428,3.2407,2.4509,3.205,6.4126,2.8419,6.8293,0.0829,3.6674,4.1396,3.9089,6.7172,3.6973,2.3595]}

It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots from the U.S.S.R. were trained. The station was also home to the Royal Flying Doctor Service Flying Rescue Flight and the Royal Air Force's Anti-Theft Unit during the war. Uxbridge was home to the British Antarctic Survey and the Cold Regions Research School, a facility that is now part of the Sanger Institute.\n\nRecent history\n\nAt the end of the Second World Conflict in 1945, RAF Uxbridge moved to new premises, which opened on 26 March 1951. Until this time, RAF Uxbridge had been the only fighter base in Northern England.\nToday, it is a major aerospace centre, producing and testing the world\u2019s most sophisticated weapons systems for the Royal Air Force and its partners.\nThe military community\u2019s interests, in recent years, have centred on how to defend the UK\u2019s coastlines in face of threats from a growing number of nuclear states, as well as the growing threat from international terrorism. One aspect of this has been the defence of airspace, with a particular interest in air defence missile (ADM) systems, which are increasingly becoming able to strike their targets on-the-fly using guided munitions.\nThis work is undertaken at RAF Valley in Great Yarmouth, and RAF Uxbridge.\nResearch has also examined how to improve military surveillance and information gathering, to augment more conventional methods and to complement more expensive systems. The defence and development programme involving RAF Uxbridge is supported by the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Royal United Services Institute.\nThe station has been home to four of the Royal Air Force's newest fighter jets for the last several years, with the fourth coming this year. A number of specialist aircraft including Tornado GR4s, Tornado IIs, Super Marabou and Jaguars have also been based at the base in the past.","token_len":419,"entropy":[1.9437,4.067,14.3525,8.6877,7.6192,0.0412,2.1804,5.9935,0.1737,12.8071,0.2975,7.1792,0.8775,4.9239,0.1273,5.7512,3.9585,6.7611,3.952,1.6285,4.1989,4.1436,0.7779,2.8128,3.4204,6.9894,1.9455,2.3931,6.1185,0.4874,0.0118,10.5666,2.3625,1.3861,2.6148,8.8509,6.14,0.3661,1.74,4.3342,1.3873,4.3979,3.0669,0.4942,0.0988,4.4536,0.1061,0.1751,0.1606,2.1612,1.6024,1.4233,2.0435,6.3093,0.9785,2.028,2.2282,0.0098,0.9512,2.9647,2.6086,11.5025,6.145,7.3288,7.8467,7.841,3.1101,1.1896,1.4681,2.5443,0.3583,2.4045,7.6034,0.1272,6.8773,0.0118,4.8449,6.7273,0.4836,1.4221,0.1686,4.9685,0.0076,0.0008,1.1515,3.6417,0.1137,0.7682,3.3566,6.2239,2.5415,1.821,0.9438,6.4508,6.1094,2.7955,5.7384,1.941,3.7356,5.3224,1.8071,4.1185,2.5161,2.5084,0.0046,0.3932,6.5338,5.2343,1.4305,1.1511,0.9328,0.0092,8.0185,3.2975,1.2284,0.0002,4.8613,0.7878,1.1415,0.0014,0.9247,1.954,0.0054,14.1669,2.1813,2.6098,1.1559,2.8428,0.7694,0.0018,0.0004,5.3623,0.5177,7.143,4.2765,2.5953,2.8943,4.5778,2.691,4.2357,2.7006,3.0081,0.4217,7.3928,2.6659,1.281,0.9188,2.6782,0.3901,0.0014,0.0004,1.2897,0.8575,3.02,1.6053,7.3057,2.2447,0.685,3.2444,2.5758,1.2935,1.7791,20.7558,0.6043,2.4551,0.6873,2.4205,3.3317,6.917,2.9686,1.5217,4.6738,4.2324,3.7778,3.3045,2.5939,19.6205,6.8985,6.1998,1.2845,2.897,3.9027,1.1987,4.1077,0.9277,2.1388,0.5933,0.0052,1.895,3.1496,3.8584,0.4289,1.0222,15.6298,5.9328,4.9391,8.7119,0.2586,0.291,4.2385,3.4712,3.3936,5.7157,0.2086,0.1874,0.1704,7.2384,0.002,0.6541,5.4647,1.2977,5.5072,1.3823,2.209,4.5444,0.3639,0.1867,6.4766,4.446,4.1669,7.9701,0.0979,2.9408,0.579,3.6555,2.595,1.395,0.0019,3.9415,5.3933,1.5458,3.4296,0.0366,0.0051,1.4771,2.7755,0.9742,1.0581,6.1558,0.8939,0.4432,6.4773,4.4635,0.1429,0.9783,2.8176,0.2133,0.6576,5.512,0.2738,4.5433,1.8765,2.957,3.154,4.3903,4.6524,0.1313,4.1515,1.5471,8.9614,6.6539,2.4005,0.1403,0.3135,1.5324,1.7231,1.4641,1.2175,3.7548,3.2511,8.3396,0.048,3.4341,5.7838,0.3178,3.3434,6.9587,1.2196,0.0037,1.3821,4.6437,5.8451,1.7337,0.5358,0.561,15.2274,5.1826,1.7918,4.829,2.4597,1.5927,14.0751,2.1201,6.1785,1.9454,0.0132,0.0002,0.5408,3.4381,4.8636,0.5086,0.003,0.0004,3.0165,1.2018,17.9004,4.7318,1.9815,7.4704,3.0347,2.2667,3.0642,5.8182,4.5617,1.5815,4.7291,2.7922,2.4342,3.6649,7.0587,6.7622,4.4816,5.585,3.438,1.1349,6.2775,2.6324,7.2533,3.0821,0.6673,2.5415,6.2354,3.6355,5.1838,3.5786,6.4348,0.7754,0.0742,0.0014,0.0003,1.6447,2.7203,0.1185,0.6582,2.6814,4.0581,0.262,3.3321,0.8028,1.5873,0.5972,2.2121,2.8598,0.0741,0.0379,0.8207,0.6999,10.1285,7.1036,2.458,1.3171,4.3177,0.0537,5.719,3.869,0.3534,2.8019,1.3524,0.0309,0.1011,4.6423,2.5049,2.0144,4.9164,1.4168,1.7988,4.0701,0.4356,0.8518,3.1095,1.0837,4.6316,3.3079,5.9386,0.2702,0.5616,4.0524,1.7607,0.0215,7.4682,1.9087,4.1188,4.4984,8.4097,3.2656,2.9994,0.9887,2.0145,5.6535,1.378,0.5884,5.2897,8.567,7.519,2.3907,1.5711,8.4576,1.7223,0.6718,0.3184,4.0261,0.7142,2.125,1.2853,3.8658,1.714,0.7961,0.9937]}

St John the Evangelist's Church, opposite the junction of Carlton Hill and White Street, was designed by George Gilbert Scott and built in 1877. The church's stained glass windows were unveiled by Earl Beaconsfield, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. Carlton Hill was the scene of the coronation of King Edward VII in 1910. The Carlton Hill Hotel was built on the estate in 1910 and was rebuilt in the 1960s, and is now a luxury hotel.\nSt John the Evangelist's Church is now a Grade I Listed building. The congregation has no church building and continues its services in the Wesley chapel, in the former school.\nThe Wesley Chapel was built in 1882 by John Brown, and opened on 1 April 1884, and is one of the most important buildings in Carlton Hill. Its main hall is listed Grade II, as is its organ, but the main feature is the high ceiling, the design of which is attributed to architect John Foley, which was constructed with hand-cut plaster panels.\nA former schoolhouse in Carlton Hill, designed by R. W. Hancock, and built in 1883, is now a public library and museum.\nThere is a football ground called the Carlton Hill Ground, formerly known as the Carlton Hill Recreation Ground, owned by Carlton Hill Football Club, which plays in the National League. It has been operated by the Club since 1895.

In the southwestern reaches the population of these immigrants was small, but they established the Yulin region, which had its own court, and the Yulin people were described as the main carriers of the ancient Chinese language and culture. In the Song period, the Jin @ - @ made up a substantial number of those who moved to the north-eastern reaches of the state, where the northern (Qingnan) population had increased by several orders of magnitude. In the region now known as the \" Three Kingdoms of China \" the Jin @ - @, or the Qin people, were described as a \" large tribe inhabiting the north-eastern mountainous range of Jin \". Their migrations were recorded to have begun in the middle of the second century, but because of the chaos created by the invasion of the Northern Wei dynasty in the tenth century these migrations had ceased to be recorded until the end of the Sung period.\n13\nThe Jin @ - @, or the Qin, had migrated from south-eastern China in order to escape the devastation that had followed the collapse of the Han empire.

Tipton may have felt it had been mistake to force Jennings out of public service and hoped that work would force him into it. He retired from the State House and began to work for a prominent local lawyer named David Jones. Jennings died in Charlestown in October 1862 of a stroke.\nAfter his death, the house was sold on April 1, 1867 to Nathan L. Cumberland of Charlestown, and he started converting it into a country house. He hired local architect Daniel M. Smith to complete that work. Smith began his work in the late spring of 1867 and was on the job just three months. Smith had to deal with the condition of the house being in disrepair from being used as a summer farm house for thirty years. Smith also wanted to keep the cottage look, so he decided to demolish the cottage building for this reason as well.\nIn 1868 the two houses were sold. In 1868 the farmhouse had been sold to a Mr. Clark and Mrs. Clark of Boston and a smaller cottage to the Rev. A. H. Williams of Concord, and they planned to convert one of the cottages and make it their home.\nThe Rev. Samuel T. Wells of Concord moved into the cottage and lived there with his family. His home in the main house was rented to the family of Dr. and Mrs. Charles A. Phillips of Concord. The Rev. Wells built a new brick addition on the west side of the home. He also made other additions to the house to provide more rooms.\nWith the death of his family in 1888, Mrs. Wells lived in the cottage with her daughter and her husband, and rented the main house.\nThe house continues to be used as a residence today although it had lost its original character. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as it had been since 1982. A new addition was built on the main house to create a large addition to the original structure.","token_len":421,"entropy":[6.4689,8.9233,4.2043,3.2324,1.1619,1.0007,8.0753,0.6101,0.5741,2.9641,4.0741,2.349,0.3821,8.2016,0.5447,0.0005,1.9062,7.3805,5.3832,0.4143,7.7534,0.7185,5.3381,3.7151,3.5345,2.0369,12.0588,1.2149,7.1917,9.2821,3.3266,0.4297,6.1997,2.2176,3.2927,9.0884,1.697,8.4263,1.0706,6.7036,0.3834,1.9323,3.1505,0.8336,2.265,5.5424,1.5533,1.1884,6.015,3.0194,2.6997,3.7754,2.3533,1.8614,1.3861,2.4496,6.1947,3.2417,5.8891,3.9066,3.6852,5.3108,0.7027,3.4887,6.0003,0.7435,7.4624,0.0004,0.0002,1.0947,4.0958,8.0235,6.3452,1.171,2.4514,0.5465,0.9245,8.2503,1.7168,1.1171,0.4064,2.6067,5.4115,1.1354,2.2763,4.3548,2.934,2.4257,0.1328,2.0675,3.6531,2.9426,7.732,4.4762,0.6292,10.7143,0.3289,2.6326,3.9722,0.0023,0.0004,1.2399,2.7597,2.3662,5.3043,10.27,1.4081,0.1393,0.3863,8.3864,0.8158,0.6138,2.1424,5.9715,5.917,3.7782,5.1769,4.3332,0.2888,4.7718,1.1214,3.7741,6.7143,2.1566,0.464,2.8246,4.9751,3.6177,2.2231,1.6203,1.9762,3.1027,5.7292,0.1684,0.4009,1.1164,1.4621,3.0509,5.066,0.8835,3.756,6.8923,4.1685,0.7767,6.0783,2.7661,2.9548,4.7449,4.791,0.0181,1.5739,6.9307,0.2809,0.3668,0.8211,5.7499,3.3003,3.9828,0.0423,4.8915,4.8654,3.3143,0.7683,0.2292,5.1168,5.0174,3.8283,2.7808,7.0716,0.6106,0.4054,2.4866,3.8049,4.5384,0.4113,3.6717,0.6551,7.5156,9.8818,5.6022,2.1722,0.7413,3.96,0.1615,4.8528,0.0003,0.8789,4.1857,6.066,4.531,6.1451,2.9108,5.1444,0.1919,0.308,1.5246,2.883,1.9092,0.8979,2.5081,5.2421,2.9676,0.6216,1.809,2.8444,2.9085,1.6198,2.433,1.5911,5.4597,1.5528,3.5019,0.7071,2.9768,1.1232,2.1959,7.8413,0.0109,6.4732,3.1742,4.4049,0.0047,5.2801,2.821,4.6501,2.9941,3.6822,6.0731,3.6699,3.6802,2.7728,4.2838,0.0091,4.8496,0.0494,3.2917,0.2852,4.8921,0.6341,5.9286,1.4088,2.4294,3.0829,5.1546,0.2357,3.0987,5.5758,0.5003,0.2781,7.0615,0.1948,0.0018,3.0798,3.9594,1.2761,2.6585,1.6072,0.4072,1.8785,1.8363,5.2937,0.007,4.7028,4.1736,0.452,5.8982,1.3307,1.9007,4.9813,2.6251,0.2127,1.911,1.6982,5.0952,0.4691,2.9915,0.5481,3.0402,1.3712,3.2872,4.5941,3.5303,1.5522,6.8235,1.359,0.8366,5.0851,1.5364,1.9852,3.3635,2.0436,3.4556,0.0212,5.5051,0.3078,0.0052,3.8056,3.7538,0.0652,6.5858,1.1399,2.6798,0.8387,1.738,3.4238,0.0111,5.8335,4.2997,1.4594,2.924,5.0785,9.7017,2.0686,0.3169,4.6261,0.4836,0.1785,0.0872,4.3796,1.762,2.2203,1.8323,3.9276,5.887,1.453,0.6211,0.176,1.2152,2.7148,4.6714,3.0546,3.2189,2.201,1.0108,5.4649,0.6885,5.3759,0.0249,1.6946,4.3181,1.8453,5.2889,0.7501,5.404,0.002,3.3897,5.5769,0.7942,0.4813,1.5647,2.0102,0.4279,2.8075,1.9569,2.576,1.6239,1.8285,1.849,7.1485,0.956,5.0459,0.2752,2.1792,1.8479,1.5913,1.9592,7.1635,0.1333,0.5954,1.3597,0.8609,0.268,3.6719,5.5939,7.2754,1.2522,4.1755,6.6571,1.0719,1.3957,5.5367,1.7097,2.0359,1.2887,6.3577,2.0603,0.2923,2.1435,0.0256,0.0831,0.0017,0.0012,0.5845,4.779,2.1566,7.288,2.2764,0.948,5.6846,7.692,0.4162,4.07,2.8934,5.3939,1.6102,1.0279,1.4727,0.3832,3.0964,0.7629,3.7749,4.4156,0.5691,3.9382,6.1409,0.8161,0.1145,3.129,3.459,0.3141]}

{"prompt":"On 22 November 1941 , M\u00f6lders travelled as a passenger in a Heinkel He 111 of Kampfgeschwader 27 `` < unk > `` from the Crimea to Germany to attend the funeral of his superior","text":"On 22 November 1941, M\u00f6lders travelled as a passenger in a Heinkel He 111 of Kampfgeschwader 27 `` < unk > `` from the Crimea to Germany to attend the funeral of his superior, the Hauptmann Hans von Kuhlmann, who had been killed in action.[1] During the flight, M\u00f6lders's engine blew up, causing loss of engine power. The pilot landed behind the aircraft and took off with a broken wing, landing at Fokker Dr.I base of Kleinaschwalbach near Dortmund. After medical treatment he volunteered to take over the command of the squadron. He returned to the front, but returned to Germany soon afterwards because the airfield at Kleinaschwalbach was deemed unsuitable.\nThe Germans attempted to use their new fighter, the Messerschmitt Bf 110, as combat aircraft as from 1943, but with only two Bf 110's in service, M\u00f6lders's experience with the Fockers, Heinkels and Bf 109s, had proven valuable.[1] In 1943 he made his personal record with a Bf 110 with a mission at Rastenburg. He was credited with six aerial victories at the time, including two Fw 190s of Schnellboot 7 (a flight of Heinkel He 111s) of the JG 37; three Bf 110s and one Bf 109 of the KLu 177. M\u00f6lders was not captured along with the six victories.\nM\u00f6lders was among those pilots who were credited with ten victories, as opposed to nine victories that Schultze had previously claimed, two claims which were later disputed. In 1943 and 1944, M\u00f6lders was credited with eight victories under heavy fighter and bomber bombardment. At the time of his promotion of 1st lieutenant, on 1 January 1944, M\u00f6lders was credited with 11 victories, two claims of four and two cases of five victories.[2] In 1943 he won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.[3]","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.7205,2.9287,6.0964,0.3868,7.1022,4.8862,4.0548,2.5555,10.4268,6.3296,1.4252,3.1868,1.8535,0.5565,9.866,0.2344,6.3144,5.9424,5.8682,9.2159,1.1413,13.4836,2.39,4.6052,3.5963,7.5756,14.5952,13.7901,9.0519,5.5995,6.9452,6.4636,5.1456,1.8301,9.7019,1.1746,3.6228,2.9598,4.7374,0.9056,2.9562,0.3794,3.0508,8.861,1.3873,2.4132,8.2549,0.1524,1.3601,8.4425,2.1556,7.3668,2.0448,1.5233,1.1758,1.4561,1.8485,1.0741,1.3542,0.955,0.8821,6.9803,2.5539,0.0716,4.0856,0.7672,3.8272,1.0455,1.0674,0.0057,0.0044,0.0015,5.4377,6.9969,3.8499,1.4778,1.3914,2.6796,6.4205,0.0246,4.724,0.254,1.5461,2.0272,3.3122,6.1918,7.717,0.7885,3.6959,1.319,4.4861,0.6319,2.6193,2.2224,5.5356,2.4583,1.8857,4.2437,2.2345,6.5137,5.5922,1.2514,7.5239,2.4263,9.4211,10.449,4.2636,8.7088,8.0715,2.7772,9.4685,7.8027,3.5511,5.6514,0.8977,3.5499,7.8782,0.9529,2.4293,8.663,0.6862,2.2759,2.6067,0.7684,5.3171,0.3724,0.2409,5.4723,1.1152,1.9818,3.7395,0.5258,1.4838,5.5491,2.5041,2.075,4.9255,1.0184,4.5114,4.9411,1.8135,5.0911,2.7867,4.9661,2.9931,3.3573,4.0329,0.0405,0.0081,0.3101,0.0026,0.6721,6.1012,1.9892,0.0074,2.3741,3.8503,6.3474,4.5698,5.128,0.1436,3.6427,4.6366,3.6634,3.6759,3.8402,0.439,5.5553,0.0493,0.0141,0.0043,3.7902,1.0015,4.3226,0.8623,1.289,7.9951,0.9051,5.0478,8.4228,3.6483,2.2111,0.5984,4.7379,3.6154,2.3559,5.5749,0.0531,1.7827,2.2101,2.102,1.1657,1.3666,3.7406,0.0086,0.005,0.0022,2.4225,4.9961,2.3327,0.9461,4.3809,7.6983,2.3625,3.2729,5.1033,5.3531,4.8284,1.7043,3.9234,0.4551,0.3688,1.1748,1.5141,4.5665,4.5556,4.614,3.3373,2.5412,0.0293,2.7121,3.5879,3.3075,4.5088,2.0753,6.2935,5.1586,3.4088,2.9365,2.6781,0.02,1.761,3.8403,2.1088,6.1204,4.9092,5.0973,5.5068,1.8834,1.9022,1.767,1.7374,5.4605,0.2268,5.4505,7.9958,0.3913,3.9156,1.722,3.9729,1.1908,1.5838,2.5589,6.1748,2.9372,0.1115,2.0383,4.9543,9.8828,1.6475,12.2694,7.6574,3.7086,4.5659,7.0596,1.7881,6.8742,0.2999,2.1712,0.417,2.5037,1.687,5.3765,1.5955,7.078,2.6524,5.7447,4.7208,3.1002,2.2096,0.0131,1.2556,0.4933,3.3638,2.0901,1.2942,0.0286,0.4223,1.5066,0.829,3.9441,10.6224,7.5456,2.6675,2.7591,0.0042,0.0076,0.0036,1.7182,4.8472,6.9032,5.7759,0.353,1.5431,5.6537,6.6906,2.1121,1.5076,1.8668,0.1775,0.0061,0.0035,1.5131,4.8218,2.6191,5.178,0.7634,2.7077,3.8842,0.0905,6.3403,1.3922,2.3299,4.151,4.0435,0.0009,4.3814,3.3946,5.2319,7.1117,7.2604,2.0167,2.326,4.2593,3.6291,3.1495,5.9106,9.35,2.5068,1.2185,1.9889,3.0001,1.3565,2.6147,2.5003,3.858,0.0978,0.8511,1.1976,0.0027,0.006,0.004,1.4854,1.7824,0.1081,3.465,0.7936,5.8672,7.4442,6.1724,4.5142,1.4647,3.8939,1.4965,4.3896,1.0789,1.0983,0.949,0.4565,5.9624,5.2986,6.7948,2.0109,4.7533,1.2435,4.6312,2.9114,1.9321,1.3565,0.2201,1.091,0.0031,0.0074,0.0102,0.9144,3.4906,0.1036,4.7108,0.392,2.2843,3.7479,4.4343,3.2095,4.7287,3.0416,1.8283,6.3085,0.128,2.266,1.6246,1.9314,0.7282,0.022,2.0166,2.8866,2.119,5.5083,1.3568,8.2847,2.2212,2.5052,3.1222,0.7072,6.5018,0.7164,3.265,11.9745,5.6742,5.7774,0.1343,0.0167]}

I would have this great man, who can speak so beautifully '' of the '' fine '' `` unripe thoughts '' (in a sonnet written to express a personal pain about a rejected love) as `` unripe, '' `` unripened, `` and `` unperfumed `` (a sonnet written at the start of the seventeenth century) say what he has said in this poem, had the speaker expressed, and not merely thought, the truths it is the purpose of poetry to reveal. The words of all true poetry are the expressions of the soul.\n`` To the soul, if once she opens up her inner temple, what can the greatest poet say of the unripe? '' (A sonnet on poetry written in the 1820s.) Here, again, the speaker is not writing for the eyes of readers, but for the ears of the listener at the hearth :\n`` The heart is much more open within to the music of the soul than is the eye or ear in their total ignorance of the meaning of music and sound. '' ( A sonnet on music written in 1822.) That is, Blake does not intend the reader to be as he is, unable to understand the words that he utters, but to be enlightened and able to understand, as the spiritual nature may be understood.","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.8782,7.7775,8.0387,1.1827,1.4914,8.4989,15.5158,0.1443,2.2679,3.5648,3.2801,2.6309,2.9469,10.1181,12.4116,11.1853,4.3753,1.7304,4.8673,8.8448,4.5436,6.2045,3.0726,6.8712,1.981,7.3237,0.1108,4.3974,1.0111,2.5175,6.9094,13.8044,4.6875,3.4218,3.7387,7.7682,0.0081,1.3943,3.265,1.8432,2.1706,3.1653,2.9096,0.782,3.9616,1.2506,2.3205,6.1217,7.0725,3.382,2.097,0.9727,1.8415,4.0845,1.7743,7.0831,1.8868,0.1955,2.1308,2.1471,2.7548,4.4906,3.2101,1.0051,0.093,1.1195,3.682,3.7857,0.6417,1.1103,3.6872,0.06,0.4346,2.3912,3.5823,5.4327,1.1928,0.8372,9.3329,1.5098,2.1059,4.5229,0.4259,8.9373,4.7779,5.5039,6.0299,2.5212,0.0006,4.4206,6.5319,0.7488,0.2232,5.4738,2.4579,0.5746,3.6355,1.3072,9.1162,3.2213,0.4468,5.238,5.6308,7.3882,2.1995,5.0173,4.672,6.3105,6.3221,0.0037,4.7108,8.1707,3.2491,4.2657,1.9819,4.0178,0.4166,12.6752,2.2902,3.2407,5.2367,3.8349,6.9708,12.1555,1.4823,3.5258,3.3921,9.1489,0.0053,1.7109,0.8185,7.5159,0.5072,3.2509,8.2951,1.9837,2.3627,7.8594,1.6602,2.9095,6.8142,0.3191,5.048,3.1464,0.785,4.1133,11.1574,8.2823,2.7546,2.6733,4.5092,2.0603,6.9761,3.2607,5.7562,2.9629,3.4644,4.4054,2.9724,3.7696,4.5082,7.1325,2.0293,1.5461,5.1405,6.373,6.0971,8.0823,6.6651,4.9054,0.124,5.1757,3.73,5.3217,4.0984,3.3684,6.7011,0.0283,5.624,3.7444,7.2375,2.6806,4.6627,6.3295,5.1915,1.6966,8.8165,3.9337,1.8056,2.8334,5.6054,5.763,0.4451,0.014,2.8213,4.3741,7.1703,2.4441,5.7647,0.3398,0.6813,1.7014,3.1363,1.7758,1.5173,6.9766,3.727,0.7892,4.9482,1.965,3.3482,2.4835,0.0049,1.4729,4.7291,0.8409,4.9741,0.0489,1.2195,6.4464,0.0119,0.0716,3.3344,7.9641,4.4424,2.2529,2.908,2.0803,2.84,3.4245,2.8162,1.4432,7.7354,2.791,5.1787,6.4087,4.9087,3.0175,4.2369,2.8452,4.972,1.0454,1.732,6.9121,4.5407,3.1986,4.5151,5.3895,0.1571,4.376,0.1852,4.8652,0.9275,2.3623,5.0067,1.5465,6.3375,6.1982,4.0907,1.1805,2.6496,7.1005,0.2616,1.5625,5.125,2.159,2.1168,0.7093,4.5388,2.6277,5.5141,1.2304,5.184,7.9097,5.8612,6.1464,3.7906,1.5123,4.8847,7.3283,0.702,4.5305,3.2606,3.7881,6.0389,1.1282,2.1563,2.4212,1.7338,5.5895,0.2093,0.025,4.4429,2.5978,2.9969,3.4604,3.0418,0.0044,4.7339,3.8294,4.0616,1.6842,0.7931,5.889,3.1883,0.1134,2.5162,6.3085,1.9456,4.2127,0.1416,1.6416,2.838,1.8551,2.315,6.0999,3.5249,1.0708,7.6699,1.9715,6.0859,0.9924,0.3697,0.5361,0.4789,2.9369,0.2643,1.2512,2.7352,6.9559,1.0185,7.6125,0.4766,8.3622,2.8136,0.725,2.3143,4.7332,1.5562,6.5131,1.557,3.459,8.3586,4.1686,1.303,6.577,0.6226,1.0694,3.3824,0.7963,3.9753,0.5633,4.3349,3.7778,1.8806,4.115,6.4173,9.4323,4.445,0.7435,0.9899,3.7722,0.2371,3.8215,3.1709,5.8361,0.4756,4.4721,0.797,6.1214,0.6217,0.0009,0.3373,2.2487,0.2961,0.5,3.2118,3.7134,0.5613,5.0773,1.1444,0.8166,7.5644,4.1355,0.0451,3.7354,2.2156,3.3263,0.1964,1.8604,5.1479,6.6137,1.1298,2.261,8.1802,0.1544,2.5929,1.021,4.5325,3.7309,1.3606,6.187,0.0052,1.2609,2.1218,1.7201,1.3482,7.5994,2.7149,3.3741,0.0553,2.6157,3.8273,2.5728,2.1278,7.9446,6.0198,7.1366,1.7399,5.0494,1.4043]}

Tech permitted an average of 99 @. @ 3 yards per game on the ground ( with the most rushing yards taken off of Tech by opposing offensive lines in the SEC ) compared with a @. @ 3 yards per game average offensively and, like Mississippi State, a more consistent quarterback, Tech's Jordan L. Taylor ( 24@ for a touchdown, @ for a passing TD ) and tight end Daniel Johnson ( 6@ against Virginia Tech ) had positive outings. When Johnson ran the ball for Virginia Tech, Tech gave up an average of just 1@ on three or more plays on the ground ( 0 @ against Kentucky and 1 @ versus LSU and Georgia Tech ) on a night Virginia Tech put together an eight play, 69 yard drive that opened with the running play that turned into a 3@ on seven-yard run that was intercepted.\nAs it turned out for both teams, the game plan worked as expected against each other. In the SEC, no matter who was running offense, the defenses of Kentucky and LSU, both favored to receive some attention in the conference championship, and Georgia Tech's own defense that was the No. 5 ranked defense against the pass in this year's rankings had the most sacks and interceptions in SEC play, it was clear that the offenses of both teams would be tested. LSU, which played in its second straight SEC title game, could be considered, for those purposes, the favored team.\nLuckily for both teams, though, they could turn to the other side of the football and the offense would be up when both teams needed it to gain control of the game. In the case of Virginia Tech, which did not have to depend on its defense to keep pace with Kentucky's offense, the other side of the game was the receiving corps against the passing offense.\nKentucky led the entire game, 34-28, with the quarterback for Virginia Tech, Jordan Taylor, completing 6@ of 15 attempts, including a 7@ against Kentucky's cornerback, and taking three rushing TDs.","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.816,2.942,5.6404,11.4003,3.6997,5.4408,4.9706,2.4994,5.1089,4.5375,16.7259,3.3113,4.5682,1.3418,3.4903,2.8576,2.9218,0.5538,5.4113,8.9679,3.8639,0.4193,0.1421,6.6527,16.146,5.9219,9.3423,8.1123,4.3189,0.1654,3.634,2.6315,1.9742,1.0397,3.0298,10.4602,2.7148,4.951,3.405,2.1527,6.275,5.1895,2.0491,5.3957,5.1492,5.5142,3.5908,4.4069,2.4549,1.8341,5.4169,4.9464,4.2856,2.9,2.8829,6.443,1.2753,4.2659,2.4529,1.545,0.1942,0.3535,2.5821,8.9431,3.9009,6.2075,5.5013,6.5693,0.3519,0.4582,3.8634,4.0155,3.2176,6.0533,3.8947,6.1488,1.7821,9.6522,6.3404,5.4862,6.3262,3.1345,6.7637,9.2431,6.8697,3.2445,4.535,1.9959,6.1932,5.533,1.1225,5.8156,2.0021,2.3505,2.5573,5.6798,0.0344,6.3673,5.9911,0.0994,4.6359,1.6272,5.6301,6.654,0.043,2.5906,3.3404,6.872,6.9884,1.7262,5.9186,6.0414,3.7866,1.7522,0.1454,3.2638,5.4725,0.0421,0.968,1.2061,3.5169,0.2669,2.058,0.0736,0.1958,3.8931,3.2182,8.4888,3.1615,6.3582,5.0171,0.2403,1.7785,4.3464,1.0437,0.5042,1.457,6.6169,4.125,4.3294,5.7291,2.0476,1.564,0.299,3.8647,3.4263,4.667,5.9591,0.4531,2.1943,5.4688,3.209,6.0541,8.3776,0.0751,6.216,2.7012,5.7878,5.3984,5.283,1.6333,5.8078,1.3313,1.2367,2.2397,6.1028,4.1311,2.9873,5.3906,4.1907,3.6929,4.4262,1.1113,0.4723,4.0297,5.6117,4.6369,7.5182,1.7118,0.4279,2.1325,2.452,3.0272,2.4552,2.4393,2.0824,6.287,4.326,1.1769,0.0062,5.3351,3.7237,1.2219,0.349,1.7465,2.6894,4.9091,2.8243,3.4494,1.5241,4.1774,6.133,1.2672,0.7782,3.7172,1.0657,5.0929,1.0047,6.1558,4.2612,1.9793,1.5318,2.4549,6.6854,0.6227,2.0526,7.549,4.1117,4.5491,0.6778,3.0268,4.4715,2.8767,5.813,3.4494,7.4096,5.8168,4.2411,2.5769,0.4569,4.9876,1.6269,5.5945,2.8474,4.3346,0.0442,2.5196,6.065,2.2969,6.0912,2.1196,4.1535,3.6246,0.0145,3.7526,1.892,1.7451,3.3918,1.52,4.78,2.9163,5.6176,1.0668,0.0081,3.6802,3.9785,1.9398,2.1294,4.7485,2.3925,3.7448,1.9139,3.8211,1.8094,2.619,7.5992,1.2645,5.1441,0.9792,1.5568,6.6344,0.7042,0.8745,0.24,2.4523,1.4547,5.1246,2.4644,4.5717,2.6773,2.7824,4.607,3.3504,3.307,2.8627,2.8345,2.588,1.3313,0.2569,0.812,5.8101,2.3223,2.7506,6.6748,2.6983,4.6119,4.1879,0.0629,1.0652,5.9247,0.5347,2.1094,1.1005,8.8064,0.3275,1.9603,0.181,0.1526,4.1526,0.0279,3.6366,3.8936,5.371,2.7855,1.2494,3.7667,0.8602,0.5345,0.0795,3.5682,2.3356,4.6787,4.3504,2.5415,1.2858,5.0225,5.3716,3.1744,0.2768,3.6298,0.5265,3.8033,7.8428,4.7806,0.6579,0.1642,0.8157,0.5163,2.9297,0.8201,5.0175,0.0259,1.9266,0.003,0.5001,4.4757,4.5344,0.8147,1.5383,2.6081,6.1332,0.282,2.3301,1.5948,1.1411,4.5319,2.998,0.3309,4.0707,1.1801,1.7458,0.4143,1.1114,5.3266,1.8889,0.5357,0.0284,3.8742,1.5671,3.1652,6.6347,2.1481,5.3992,1.3424,1.7734,2.3258,0.7165,2.8493,3.7912,0.0014,4.6146,0.5711,5.4796,2.8079,2.6295,7.8126,0.0982,2.862,0.4383,1.09,2.7411,5.9195,4.6066,4.0115,0.0052,1.4973,3.2418,4.4037,0.9314,3.0682,4.6018,6.3444,1.8852,3.4078,4.3589,2.8599,3.4306,1.6966,4.1768,1.0073,5.2133,2.3564,1.9021,8.0973,1.1992,3.497,5.5948,3.8687,6.2703,1.3261,1.7212]}

The Merkava is no longer used, as in the past, for reconnaissance because it is already too difficult for a light combat vehicle to do reconnaissance well and well in combat. The Merkava can be seen primarily as a patrol, close quarters patrol, mobile sniper platoon and fire support vehicle. As an urban armored vehicle it is limited.\nThe Merkava is no longer the only vehicle with the capability of moving through the Israeli cities or towns. There are other armored vehicles that can make the move, some of which were designed specifically for this role, and there are also armored vehicles that can move through urban areas. In any combat situation it is the best vehicle on the battle field at the worst times that decides whether or not a battle is won or lost.\nHowever, the light combat role of the Merkava has always been to provide cover and protection for the infantry on the battlefield. It is the role it was designed for, and its design as a military vehicle is not compatible with doing urban operations.\nDespite this it took the Israeli military over fifty years to realize the problem, despite several attempts, and in the light of this study we see that the Israel Defense Forces still have not found a correct approach to the problem.\nAs the number of urban warfare operations continues to increase in number and in scale the Israeli military will have to decide whether or not to do away with the Merkava because the light combat role it was meant to fill has been expanded and its original light combat role is now diminished.","token_len":422,"entropy":[5.168,7.6897,11.1916,9.4449,9.3571,2.9642,0.3956,8.3057,3.4281,6.5237,1.4607,1.0931,7.5868,1.8332,6.0996,6.8854,0.1506,0.3408,0.7007,9.5402,0.1686,7.5827,1.7584,2.3821,7.7601,4.4475,0.3521,5.0755,0.6264,1.4079,9.6027,0.6775,0.0272,3.0632,0.507,7.5186,4.1906,2.4958,9.5777,0.5629,0.0668,12.7425,8.2245,3.8242,7.3685,2.2849,4.2751,4.7102,5.8413,3.1603,6.8658,1.6332,4.2286,4.7615,0.1969,1.151,8.3014,5.3044,0.1668,4.9251,1.2227,0.0033,0.0096,1.5801,0.0034,0.0524,6.6526,3.5278,2.1941,1.4607,2.4211,3.9043,4.7089,2.1388,6.6331,2.3495,5.2599,1.0763,2.176,7.7178,5.489,4.7847,1.025,1.8475,3.6813,2.1698,1.5097,0.0015,0.0075,0.2393,0.0007,0.0087,4.9697,2.9306,3.6097,2.124,5.6927,5.1236,1.1492,0.0032,0.0095,0.1506,0.0015,0.0333,6.1463,0.7713,3.2665,0.862,3.0155,0.685,0.9538,4.9053,0.7019,1.8139,0.8192,0.0012,0.0046,6.745,3.0627,0.0333,2.8741,3.8336,2.542,4.1034,0.7915,3.1458,0.5984,1.31,2.8742,5.269,1.2295,1.2111,5.8325,3.1292,3.8743,2.0292,2.581,2.4352,1.611,0.2591,0.1227,4.9696,1.6514,6.7495,3.0028,7.0338,2.9084,3.9483,0.9091,2.0167,0.5901,0.0013,0.0045,4.7008,1.5484,3.504,5.8709,0.7787,0.3474,4.2618,4.5353,6.0465,0.2352,4.7123,1.9471,6.2445,5.9093,6.4966,2.1079,5.6542,0.7914,0.5643,0.6422,4.1625,3.8977,2.5911,6.7229,1.3648,1.9848,0.9429,5.9605,4.4727,0.9462,1.4919,0.5847,0.0015,0.005,2.269,3.0177,0.0038,3.1005,1.8738,2.4763,3.3497,1.5243,2.3704,1.4987,4.2448,3.0442,1.49,4.889,4.3701,4.251,4.44,1.0527,4.1859,0.5165,2.5501,3.2914,0.3733,2.0644,1.1342,5.8471,2.2588,4.6929,2.3011,5.0679,0.6028,0.5233,3.081,1.8719,2.8227,0.2971,2.6463,0.8674,2.0398,2.3188,3.7098,0.326,1.1065,3.0082,1.2666,0.9719,0.7638,2.7316,1.7403,3.0698,0.6952,1.2367,3.1118,4.3393,9.5427,0.676,3.0425,0.3903,3.7732,4.466,1.8418,5.7775,0.1457,6.4574,0.4798,5.5959,1.5637,8.2832,3.0425,5.015,7.4006,2.6355,1.2871,0.0049,1.754,2.1613,0.7488,1.2961,1.3728,0.0272,0.1605,0.6682,4.3991,0.3701,1.2782,6.621,0.9432,0.5912,1.4039,0.1516,0.132,0.0013,0.0026,2.9143,3.991,0.2738,4.7098,1.8775,2.4819,2.052,2.0126,0.9901,0.9335,2.826,4.1778,0.3049,1.3696,0.527,2.282,0.9531,2.3916,4.5596,5.1728,2.7108,0.6382,1.3946,1.9034,1.5126,3.1174,4.6852,4.7191,1.2668,5.0478,0.7812,2.2479,2.4833,3.6833,0.0235,9.2511,3.3719,2.862,1.0605,0.9409,5.362,2.0507,4.044,6.3469,1.683,3.655,2.0484,5.0448,5.2936,0.0573,0.2366,3.583,1.2065,5.9352,3.274,5.4761,5.7948,2.2664,1.4804,1.6699,3.8363,1.4696,5.0692,0.5507,2.6061,6.5644,2.3674,4.1499,0.6628,0.7991,4.4404,0.0818,0.0341,3.707,2.5959,2.9431,3.6876,0.8062,7.0392,4.4164,0.6115,1.8238,1.0887,0.9745,0.879,4.0269,1.8194,5.7608,0.0542,2.9109,2.5222,3.437,3.4687,0.3331,1.0008,2.423,4.4073,1.4097,3.1053,3.203,1.5768,3.3173,0.9977,2.6905,1.8655,0.1573,3.9154,1.2282,0.7048,0.0035,0.3626,4.2998,8.7179,0.0035,0.4853,0.6172,0.0011,0.005,5.2927,2.2208,4.8991,0.1567,0.0927,4.2227,1.4787,4.7049,0.3422,3.0197,1.6962,2.0692,5.9625,2.1813,2.8888,3.8696,8.3057,0.6998,0.0644,1.6836,1.6188,5.8233,0.2174]}

{"prompt":"Another law enforceable by public burning was De heretico comburendo , introduced in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV . It allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy","text":"Another law enforceable by public burning was De heretico comburendo, introduced in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV. It allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy (and later, of schismatic) acts. For this, convicted subjects had to be bound and nailed to the city wall where they had to be severely shackled by at least three thieves' ropes for seven years in front of the whole city population, having to stand with their heels up on blocks. In addition, after the execution, they had to be exposed at once in a well-lit place until midnight.\nThis law still maintained that execution was the ultimate punishment as the subject was not a party.\nIn 1403, Henry V created a new punishment that would end all sorts of punishments in which a subject was a party. This consisted of exiling the crime perpetrator into a remote island known as the Tower of London -until his death or his confession. But this punishment came later and was not applied to all crimes.\nThe most brutal torture applied after the death penalty was called le ravalement ; from 1529, it was defined as the placing of the condemned in a small barrel made out of wood and then suspended upright. This punishment was used to extort confessions from the condemned subjects.\nIn 1660, Louis XIV applied le b\u00fbcher as the ultimate punishment after death. The condemned were sentenced as being 'hors de combat'. A sentence to le b\u00fbcher was followed by public exposure on a scaffold. After this, the condemned subjects had to be skinned alive. They were tied to a large stake where they were suspended until their death and with an instrument to cut them open, thus ending their pain.\nThe last punishment considered cruel is death by hanging without a scaffold. It is to be observed that there is a hierarchy between the various punishments (and in fact, some punishments could be carried out only by the king himself). In all cases, it was the executioner who decided whether to apply the punishments stated by the laws.","token_len":423,"entropy":[7.5081,10.0828,2.2383,0.9091,5.1307,11.6497,3.9488,9.8361,12.0332,4.149,4.0737,12.7008,10.7321,6.2985,1.2206,2.539,9.8366,1.1833,4.3058,4.4472,6.7107,0.4091,1.172,0.0497,4.8337,2.002,0.9453,1.5189,4.681,2.8512,0.854,4.5644,0.1773,2.4415,4.0449,6.2149,0.2541,6.8402,0.4519,0.1349,5.0771,4.2658,4.0671,6.2658,2.6734,2.5076,7.5397,0.0424,1.0678,6.028,6.5377,1.3346,4.5117,2.3418,3.1737,8.2523,8.2081,2.7003,0.2589,0.7034,5.4628,3.3516,4.3725,0.4388,1.2672,6.8748,1.8275,5.6878,0.3473,2.4534,3.1489,1.1352,8.2681,6.6252,0.0001,3.7776,8.1071,0.121,2.1776,7.6231,5.318,4.6249,4.5214,3.7716,2.1853,4.6271,5.8189,0.0176,1.1327,5.2228,2.0211,9.1176,2.0026,6.3196,0.9128,3.0029,4.3625,0.4966,6.4735,3.285,2.1658,8.5136,3.0922,2.9366,3.1152,0.3482,5.2576,1.5568,2.1861,1.2673,2.8738,0.7648,0.1406,1.0371,5.9142,4.9425,3.0406,3.2791,1.7633,5.0722,1.4877,1.7188,1.5568,4.622,6.7023,1.7605,1.9505,9.4803,0.5175,6.1815,6.3801,1.6153,5.5924,1.2268,2.9437,5.9441,1.0714,6.1975,2.8816,6.0834,1.4462,2.9702,3.6539,5.4115,3.2237,2.3898,2.6437,2.0454,3.7337,0.6173,4.0615,2.599,6.547,1.1397,1.7112,4.8759,3.844,3.052,5.9428,2.305,7.1154,0.002,3.4377,3.6567,4.5252,2.191,3.8522,0.9637,3.9258,0.9172,0.716,2.2093,6.2572,0.1692,6.8537,4.5533,1.6944,6.6806,6.3941,4.6436,1.0594,6.621,4.3305,4.8036,0.138,1.6147,7.4462,0.1954,1.2453,6.9477,9.6112,3.5761,2.0271,3.7082,3.4322,6.3332,1.2766,5.652,2.2537,3.1004,5.7469,4.9541,2.3792,1.3109,2.2232,3.7815,0.7428,2.4247,2.7662,1.1231,1.3199,1.8629,4.8666,5.7102,5.3318,6.31,5.5521,1.1793,1.2025,2.1711,0.3774,4.798,6.6568,9.2633,9.213,5.209,7.3861,5.9008,2.9627,4.5289,1.5014,2.4435,0.397,5.9745,0.2719,2.0003,5.8397,1.5171,2.4277,2.9905,1.3914,0.5074,4.8039,8.0714,5.6517,2.384,0.0133,2.1684,1.9286,3.4664,6.9418,7.7475,1.905,2.6535,3.1026,0.6615,3.2208,1.9205,6.323,0.4662,2.7484,1.0482,1.9288,2.6321,4.7796,1.3763,1.0562,2.0732,2.7717,5.1556,0.1393,5.4785,1.3418,5.5521,2.3632,6.3524,7.7116,3.6842,5.4756,1.0318,2.6028,0.2911,4.2188,4.2362,1.0477,2.3161,5.4894,1.1747,5.1347,5.4008,4.7955,3.7685,5.3769,2.6945,3.9769,6.0069,3.6316,4.5085,4.5327,5.1743,6.3797,0.8994,0.1284,0.018,0.8719,4.8319,0.5236,7.3162,6.3776,4.7349,2.5083,4.7811,0.1236,1.6618,3.9861,2.7092,0.596,0.937,1.6987,3.8539,2.3507,0.1447,0.5265,8.3158,0.0256,3.5286,1.966,3.6737,0.7247,5.2106,0.8613,1.0201,4.3975,4.4991,5.5466,0.4283,1.0119,6.5997,2.9179,2.1641,3.3553,4.26,6.2045,4.1642,4.8493,3.2322,2.8924,1.9596,2.6377,2.7397,5.7423,4.5445,1.1772,7.4252,0.4631,0.8321,1.731,5.0917,3.7445,6.1957,5.0786,4.0168,4.7539,1.5521,0.9852,6.1787,2.0879,3.9719,0.0497,0.4655,2.6015,2.0042,5.1725,0.1954,3.057,0.1502,4.1488,1.3791,1.7856,7.2022,3.5761,1.2588,4.9091,1.3689,4.883,3.7573,3.9664,2.3807,1.0137,3.3243,4.3328,4.8817,0.666,3.9904,0.1257,3.8896,1.2487,1.7595,4.6861,2.3315,0.9735,2.8417,4.8404,1.2226,0.5787,2.963,0.9948,2.1794,2.8582,0.4394,0.3548,5.0844,2.1019,1.0816,5.0052,1.1995,4.9173,7.3032,2.5491,0.6331,4.0099,1.0636]}

York drew 3 \u2013 3 away to Bristol Rovers to maintain their five-point lead at the top of the Championship \u2013 but not before another goal from Bowman, with Callum Taylor, Chris Morris, John Hume and Josh Davenport taking some consolation goals.\nIn midweek, Bowman scored his only goal of the season as York 3 \u2013 1 Winchester, putting York back in pole position. York then hosted Derby County in their opening game of the New Year, losing 2 \u2013 1. Bowman scored the second half equaliser as York fought back from a 0 \u2013 1 deficit to pull their opponents within one point of York, albeit with Derby two points clear.\nHowever all that came to a head at home to Doncaster Rovers where York lost a last-minute penalty miss after David Bony gave his side a 2 \u2013 0 lead with 10 minutes left, before Bowman saved another penalty and chipped home to maintain York\u2019s lead at the break. Bowman went on to play his part in York\u2019s fourth match of the season at home to Coventry City. He came off the bench in York\u2019s second half equaliser following the winner by David Bony.\nBowman received an early reminder of his place in York\u2019s side after being replaced five minutes before time with another penalty miss. Bowman saved Coventry\u2019s second attempt to keep his side up and prevent a return from Coventry.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s match against Bristol City, Bowman came on as a late substitute for Craig Gardner at the break but lost a penalty kick with five minutes left. York held the advantage thanks to a strike by Jamie Vardy into their own net midway through the 90th minute.\nBowman finally earned the starting spot when York turned over a second defeat following a 1 \u2013 3 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. York fought back from 2 \u2013 0 down in the second half with a goal by Chris Morris to draw the game.","token_len":424,"entropy":[6.4342,7.1956,2.8741,0.9555,4.8658,1.8051,8.1959,10.5183,1.5405,7.2698,0.1713,0.0001,2.6651,1.9197,3.8845,5.1236,8.0532,6.8163,0.2402,1.2058,3.3699,0.8483,4.7978,2.8137,9.6942,1.3278,0.8627,4.8839,5.5101,3.0503,2.4624,0.9958,6.7097,1.8179,4.6864,2.1483,0.0004,4.7139,6.2568,0.6205,5.9947,1.0568,0.2858,0.2784,2.868,0.4468,0.2826,0.3525,0.0333,2.2524,5.4803,1.9039,5.5271,0.4252,6.1462,1.8173,0.8604,8.949,3.5059,4.0116,8.1525,0.2675,4.9348,3.6095,5.3316,6.2579,1.2856,4.3348,7.3365,0.342,5.2974,5.7861,4.3242,0.0037,5.1003,5.3142,3.9792,4.3654,1.1744,0.5228,12.9744,7.8761,0.5053,0.6462,5.1344,1.0965,1.0056,4.8013,0.4156,0.8264,0.0249,0.35,2.5284,1.4788,7.6816,1.9656,1.5022,14.9925,1.9416,6.5009,4.2921,2.8106,0.5587,6.5601,0.0108,1.8184,4.4163,2.9434,7.1802,5.2246,0.3426,1.2269,2.4409,3.1314,0.716,0.7086,0.0754,9.8892,0.0715,1.3457,5.2169,1.4263,0.7207,0.4544,1.536,7.4314,1.1373,2.7237,2.538,4.5713,1.4892,0.0589,2.0661,1.9518,6.4225,0.1823,0.7977,1.5177,3.9821,1.5438,1.0618,0.914,0.9981,5.6151,5.2182,6.8824,2.824,1.7638,0.3312,0.69,5.3693,1.7272,5.6618,1.6666,5.4402,6.8491,0.4959,3.3556,1.4755,0.4757,5.2197,8.945,2.3746,2.7213,0.9291,1.6971,1.678,2.482,3.8793,0.9521,6.9248,0.0128,0.1987,0.0001,5.2678,3.1988,3.5544,4.3909,5.4585,0.5345,1.6529,0.6982,10.6461,4.2288,5.4162,4.9615,7.3112,4.9276,2.6927,0.5168,0.9594,2.1413,0.3669,1.9148,0.2127,3.109,4.5186,0.0554,1.3006,3.5443,1.8524,4.3152,6.2919,5.1823,2.7164,3.8033,9.2075,0.0174,2.9698,3.4842,6.1255,4.1048,17.1715,8.178,1.6386,2.0682,1.2258,0.9116,3.4178,0.1554,4.7864,4.1061,0.511,0.0235,4.8277,2.6744,4.5701,0.4959,2.4924,5.3773,0.1186,0.0262,4.432,4.672,0.8198,0.0928,0.2518,3.8421,2.4435,0.3018,5.2621,0.0002,0.395,2.4864,3.0848,4.5901,2.3293,0.4365,0.0042,2.1724,7.2568,4.7258,0.0262,0.0036,3.0238,3.0765,5.5267,0.024,4.9276,2.1156,5.1301,4.8668,4.1159,1.4259,0.0024,1.8901,0.4688,3.3704,0.0011,5.9212,2.9299,1.8355,6.0468,0.7223,0.6023,3.3345,0.5761,3.686,2.0197,0.0098,0.0015,2.7082,1.8665,3.283,4.4079,7.7758,0.0905,2.1426,3.9217,3.5777,5.4865,2.422,2.4922,1.1489,3.2444,5.7688,6.6279,0.0001,2.9551,0.0104,0.0142,1.7008,6.2664,2.3716,3.2155,3.8882,1.0156,4.0604,2.4615,8.8243,2.1677,4.4943,3.9434,2.4938,0.0009,1.9195,1.1103,2.458,6.5377,3.4906,0.254,0.0233,2.9741,1.7042,3.2946,1.4667,0.2119,0.8782,3.9185,1.2342,1.3793,1.5851,5.6145,0.0367,1.734,5.7257,5.4921,4.0855,1.224,2.4046,3.8028,5.0425,2.6163,0.8036,2.4403,4.9611,3.525,0.036,0.9171,1.2697,5.1846,4.2946,3.5983,2.1073,6.6092,0.046,1.2205,6.1203,1.8126,6.3381,5.1175,0.4169,6.8803,6.0531,0.797,0.3186,7.0599,0.008,0.0269,6.5128,0.5937,0.0061,1.1459,1.202,2.2046,0.002,7.0109,4.1186,2.4241,3.9585,1.7216,3.3779,5.89,5.6043,4.5541,1.6578,3.5026,10.4777,4.3493,1.0128,3.8892,0.1794,2.6293,2.9376,2.0296,2.954,0.1612,4.4823,0.0112,1.0126,3.4653,6.5764,0.0865,1.0644,4.6458,0.0422,1.6814,1.912,2.5548,0.6369,1.5249,0.1282,2.6816,1.9137,2.2331,1.9068,4.8058,1.2755,2.6288,4.7671,2.9135,1.1734,2.999]}

Two other","text":"Leno was born in St Pancras, London. He was the youngest of six children, including two elder brothers, John and Henry, and an elder sister, Frances. Two other brothers, Charles and Albert, and a sister, Marie, were dead. At the age of eight, Leno had been educated at the National School in Chalkenden, where he had attended to lessons with Mr Harnett on the piano. Leno spent many years as an amateur opera singer at the Savoy Theatre, where he was a pupil of Charles Gounod. For fourteen years, he also gave concerts at the Royal Academy of Music.\nOn February 21, 1883, Leno married the Miss Mary Louise Williams, daughter of John Williams, formerly a partner of Messrs. Christie, Coleman and Co. Their eldest son, Ronald Ronald Leno was born one month later, on February 22. They had a large family, of which four daughters died in infancy, one was the child of a previous marriage, and thirteen sons and two daughters.\nLeno started his career at the Theatre Royal, Stratford-upon- Avon in 1883. In the next two years he had considerable success in Covent Garden, where he was given the chance to make his debut at Covent Garden Theatre, he performed to critical acclaim in The Count of Monte Cristo, Falstaff, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Don Giovanni, Dido and Aeneas, The Rape of Lucretia, Macbeth and The Barber of Seville.\nIn 1885, Leno made his debut in London at The Lyric Theatre in a production of The Prince of Egypt. During his two years as a freelancer in London, he produced his work at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in his capacity as theatre manager.\nFrom 1886 to 1889, he performed at the Royal Lyceum Theatre with the assistance of Robert Brown, and in 1887 he appeared at the Grand Theatre Covent Garden under his own management, at The King and I, King Lear and The Merchant of Venice.","token_len":424,"entropy":[10.7205,3.9745,3.9056,0.5623,5.6534,9.8926,0.0003,0.3168,5.9682,2.1317,1.316,1.788,2.5164,1.4377,0.5925,2.3364,0.2122,1.3582,3.4421,2.7415,8.4016,0.9924,1.1621,5.5474,0.5257,5.1918,1.4528,0.9237,4.2976,4.6413,0.3078,0.3308,5.1444,1.353,6.3512,2.4535,1.5614,1.1165,4.2903,0.3449,5.5599,0.2282,3.6954,1.1512,0.447,0.219,5.0254,0.5967,1.1218,8.8292,1.6557,4.8785,0.9785,0.4167,0.0017,2.7295,0.3716,6.9565,0.3573,3.6412,2.4775,5.6443,0.5313,1.6629,5.7681,1.4641,2.0265,5.3844,5.939,5.314,0.0588,0.5353,2.5986,0.2738,2.6502,3.2639,5.1015,5.973,3.0568,4.7743,5.7389,5.4543,1.6001,5.3682,1.6518,5.701,0.7995,3.5249,0.0004,4.2593,3.2404,0.9608,2.7598,1.8612,3.2407,6.4644,0.4775,4.0299,1.1751,6.5595,0.1247,2.1713,1.0781,1.2215,0.2052,2.0056,2.3805,4.7008,1.5848,4.9764,5.0591,6.3277,6.3692,1.4335,5.7243,5.28,0.0691,1.2894,0.7117,4.9677,6.8286,3.4858,1.5889,0.9034,2.9704,2.2665,0.617,0.5146,1.6802,2.6615,11.6282,4.3021,3.6371,0.275,0.9342,3.8403,0.0471,1.116,0.0004,3.8003,3.6654,5.6865,3.4366,4.8821,5.6225,0.6867,1.9933,0.0084,3.5907,1.4969,0.6553,6.2608,1.7372,5.5818,1.3514,7.4038,0.0346,2.1892,9.0239,1.9552,8.3447,0.8679,5.8203,0.7664,3.4931,4.317,1.0719,0.3067,8.058,6.8139,2.5383,0.0014,3.2395,0.4241,7.6354,1.5158,1.0267,1.7624,2.2026,2.0883,2.7689,2.2953,3.8638,0.6215,2.7377,7.8595,1.1977,1.4143,3.5511,1.3138,3.2956,3.1638,5.1307,1.3218,0.2625,1.4447,2.9992,4.5435,4.1474,4.6878,0.0565,1.9012,4.9984,1.6587,0.9086,0.6114,6.0515,2.9357,1.5224,3.6899,0.0748,1.4667,1.4087,4.0298,0.0591,6.1795,1.0618,1.836,1.4469,1.0118,5.5628,4.0786,1.9478,11.466,0.0023,3.5647,0.0645,0.0011,16.265,0.0126,2.5254,0.6179,2.3141,0.8071,2.1334,2.4767,3.4958,2.3051,0.0858,0.5743,3.9156,5.8413,0.5169,1.3158,8.7649,1.9408,0.0022,0.6687,1.6029,0.1372,2.0612,4.8222,0.8536,6.4325,0.3308,5.1715,1.3192,1.6092,2.3555,6.5138,1.1686,0.0635,2.3006,1.434,8.026,2.7094,6.2627,6.8623,0.0415,2.0807,5.1752,6.175,1.5371,0.1239,1.1068,0.006,0.7846,9.8238,1.0074,0.8818,3.9921,7.0698,2.2883,0.0147,1.5015,6.7484,0.2517,0.3533,6.8989,2.1191,0.9209,9.657,0.6158,1.9844,5.3116,4.0225,0.256,0.8214,2.7895,10.0117,0.2531,4.5148,1.6859,0.7676,0.5277,6.7322,1.098,0.0012,1.2623,1.9247,7.3483,0.5706,6.2812,0.3894,2.3715,1.8031,1.9267,0.7747,1.1572,0.7147,2.2859,0.0009,3.648,0.3491,1.7668,1.2282,3.9743,2.8098,3.6005,6.0073,2.2479,0.7054,2.58,4.9727,4.8299,0.4008,1.649,5.2072,0.5729,6.1748,1.0158,3.9539,1.6145,4.9173,0.4351,4.0822,0.7709,10.5759,0.1268,3.0625,1.3047,0.3453,0.2744,3.8614,5.8403,5.2355,3.2794,1.1516,3.0307,0.362,11.7531,0.2309,2.9903,5.6571,3.0067,0.0681,5.5507,2.5605,0.8285,2.0943,4.8875,3.0895,0.3366,2.0185,0.2924,1.1044,2.2653,1.557,0.8008,2.3345,4.7082,3.9731,0.0357,1.541,4.6035,1.7713,4.67,0.0243,6.0034,5.9016,1.094,2.2136,2.1652,1.7972,1.7239,1.4892,2.8997,1.7377,0.6488,5.5732,2.141,10.8827,0.167,0.0558,5.7643,2.9406,0.8774,6.0193,1.8014,3.5016,3.8177,5.364,3.2894,6.0656,1.8731,7.6037,5.7788,1.5,1.3863,4.0053,0.1654,0.0107,0.5634]}

While noting the show's return to its `` darker tone, '' Anderson said that he also likes `` 'Patience'because it brings us back to the original vision of Hannibal and its original characters. ``\n`` The new story is not entirely unexpected or unpredictable ; instead, it takes the material on its own terms and creates a truly satisfying show. ''\n`` This is what I love about Hannibal - his use of psychological fiction to examine human behavior. This week in particular, it's not so much an examination as it is a confession about how we judge others. ''\n`` We learn more about Hannibal and his family, as he tries to understand what is driving his brother to seek revenge. The revelation of Hannibal's sexuality is not entirely surprising but serves as a much-needed bridge to the story beyond. As far as the return to dark themes, we really know Hannibal for what he is : an eerie, brooding, calculating psychopath. ''\nIn addition to his brother, Lynch has previously been accused of having romantic relationships with two actresses from his show Supernatural ; actress Elizabeth Chambers and actress Jessica Pimentel. The two were photographed together in January 2003 while both were employed by the show. The photographs were soon published on the Internet, causing Lynch to issue a statement denouncing the photographers as well as the magazine that published the images. After Chambers and Pimentel had denied the allegations, Lynch filed a libel suit against The Star and The Daily Sentinel with the intention of suing the magazines in court. Later, The Star published an apology and retracted the offending photographs.\nIn 2004, an article in The Advocy magazine suggested that Lynch may have been homosexual because of his relationship with Elizabeth Chambers. Lynch issued a public apology to the actress, expressing regrets that he came out to her so publicly. When asked about his sexuality in a television interview for Entertainment Weekly, he revealed that he and Chambers had been seeing each other but did not like revealing their sexuality to their mutual employers.","token_len":424,"entropy":[10.7576,2.7188,11.6686,11.5921,8.9178,8.469,3.8151,1.8463,2.5592,4.215,1.5778,10.5773,7.0831,1.6644,4.7134,1.0647,9.2589,7.4883,4.2497,4.4386,6.1768,6.3076,0.6271,6.1587,1.1603,5.8635,7.213,1.986,3.0997,0.7923,7.233,0.3346,2.6965,11.6372,12.5486,2.9839,2.7206,2.7572,1.0166,1.2955,1.9002,3.2136,5.0653,5.5672,5.7761,5.1736,6.7558,0.0117,0.7792,11.9156,0.9027,4.4311,3.2959,0.9058,0.1761,0.8553,3.7149,6.0141,0.4636,9.8161,2.2419,1.9189,4.9853,3.4744,1.9121,4.5555,4.3911,7.6713,2.1169,4.8269,4.9314,2.0056,3.3687,5.6278,4.8879,5.1649,7.2123,9.3337,4.6378,0.2606,0.8906,4.987,2.0274,7.843,5.4684,3.3018,1.0763,1.6675,1.5097,4.4189,0.8134,5.6375,5.7174,4.8238,0.9985,3.3858,0.9609,1.8333,4.0054,1.5064,4.5,1.5544,3.0982,0.1575,3.9669,4.6077,5.8787,6.4842,0.0037,5.8985,7.3591,1.4884,6.0074,3.2839,1.4503,1.2834,3.271,6.5594,4.9399,2.3068,0.6263,2.6242,1.9622,3.1686,3.9766,0.3903,3.4444,3.8402,3.8688,1.3624,0.1309,0.5938,6.7995,3.8305,2.0871,2.1262,7.553,4.1223,0.8639,3.6455,0.4549,1.353,3.4902,4.8657,2.8282,0.1776,1.8548,2.3924,1.2556,3.7338,1.9382,3.4528,3.6512,3.3449,0.0673,2.9076,2.2675,3.3318,4.9736,1.0087,5.9076,2.3485,4.7443,1.8311,1.8427,2.6943,5.7538,1.3557,2.4842,0.1006,5.498,1.8583,3.2228,5.178,1.4083,3.745,6.1732,0.5021,0.4291,5.7357,1.3175,0.0174,5.5757,0.949,1.6743,3.6383,7.1128,5.5288,3.9197,4.8226,0.0198,2.0685,7.1986,1.4831,6.7162,3.0383,1.1614,2.5598,5.2923,5.6269,5.0058,5.0637,0.6216,0.038,0.1646,6.5602,2.299,7.816,1.0295,6.2087,0.0014,1.0151,4.5668,3.6462,1.2141,2.859,0.2276,5.1156,2.3471,0.242,2.7618,5.2021,0.7557,9.8531,2.1962,4.6769,2.8844,4.6649,0.0874,3.1794,5.3262,0.9936,0.0785,3.5255,5.198,5.0105,1.595,3.9553,8.9838,0.2227,6.3824,5.3713,4.8378,7.5814,1.4586,0.8942,4.002,4.8895,3.7025,0.0023,0.6449,2.5581,2.7681,3.7098,6.0418,1.1646,1.0217,4.513,4.8359,3.1946,5.9091,0.5661,6.2625,1.0634,1.5304,2.1217,1.1781,2.2557,6.3201,1.334,5.7519,3.8491,2.0418,1.1506,1.6327,1.6535,4.6407,4.6293,0.3623,5.1615,0.4831,1.1439,5.3065,1.0773,5.5233,2.144,5.6651,0.2102,1.2839,5.9116,3.6491,1.4318,1.2377,3.2468,0.3061,4.8579,10.1799,1.8624,0.0699,0.0014,0.0017,4.1874,5.3052,1.3842,0.8967,0.2696,0.1613,4.3392,0.2929,3.2676,0.3627,0.5035,4.3282,5.2829,3.7881,1.8648,3.1417,8.2482,5.1752,0.6509,6.5549,0.0497,2.7979,1.7141,2.7618,3.5123,2.6465,0.3251,6.3454,1.2218,3.6307,0.5642,2.5339,1.5854,2.4792,2.2427,6.095,0.4523,6.032,1.8244,0.5359,2.7901,2.3031,4.2579,0.1443,5.7056,2.6009,0.9826,1.3562,13.1794,12.9875,7.3568,3.8474,0.3002,0.4893,2.6017,0.2438,1.3864,6.461,3.6486,1.0123,0.7312,2.3112,0.0466,4.524,0.11,0.6758,1.2475,6.538,0.3526,3.2117,0.4675,2.258,1.0255,4.7669,1.6842,6.0175,4.8236,2.0534,1.6756,8.1599,1.3752,3.3111,0.3024,6.2369,1.4593,0.5963,4.9343,1.2368,1.0499,2.0795,1.8817,1.707,1.8105,3.5034,0.0742,5.1683,5.6979,0.3301,0.5717,2.9315,4.5335,0.3878,0.281,5.0636,1.4621,0.8173,1.3854,7.0558,0.1068,0.0105,6.912,2.6388,0.0123,6.6741,9.4539,0.8991,2.2832,2.1354,4.4643,5.7682,4.4874,0.2164]}

In recent times tourism has increased and the government of New South Wales offers a guided tour of the reef. The World Heritage Listing was made for the reef in 1978 and its reefs were declared a marine park in 1994.\nThe world record for the longest dive on a single breath held in air is held by James Dean of the US Navy, who held it for 27 seconds in September 1997. He claims he can hold more than three minutes with air, and hold up to 24 breaths a minute in water. He has been recorded at a depth of 1,000 feet using a rebreather in air. Dean claims there is no evidence that any other man holds the world record for a longer dive. He has been criticized for using a compressed-air rebreather, which is capable only of holding air for 3\u00bd minutes. Dean's claim to have been at the depth of 1,000 feet is debunked by the Australian Museum diving team which has shown that by breathing nitrogen in the sea, Dean's maximum depth would have been 1,050 feet.\nHistorical events\nThe wreck of the HMS Wasp was found as a submerged sunken merchant ship off Point Cook in the 1980s. It was uncovered and found to be entirely intact in 1991. The ship was carrying over 50 tons of treasure in two silver vessels. The treasure had been hidden by the ship's crew during a voyage between the Philippines and New Zealand. After a yearlong operation by the Royal New Zealand Navy to retrieve the silver vessels, their contents were recovered and the ship itself was towed underwater to Portsea to be preserved aboard the Wasp. The ship is also an island on Lord Howe Island. The ship is called the Wasp as it was carrying a group of American soldiers during World War II who believed that she had been built for the SS Wasp, an American merchant ship which was wrecked in 1941 off the coast of New Zealand and carried the bodies of 1,200 servicemen to the island of Ascension.","token_len":425,"entropy":[9.3354,0.2289,1.737,7.5736,3.4627,9.8027,2.0073,8.6362,4.5868,13.0638,5.7846,1.1467,1.8716,5.2417,3.8496,8.1374,1.7636,2.1295,0.8153,2.8303,6.7387,2.8055,2.3569,2.9549,5.9474,4.6212,11.4175,0.5232,1.9762,2.3611,1.7591,4.9602,3.6655,2.8786,3.6165,0.0003,7.5867,2.0934,6.6983,0.4004,0.9827,0.4468,2.9284,0.7441,2.6614,7.0365,0.4532,3.9196,5.741,5.3424,4.4465,2.9524,0.905,1.1323,1.1229,5.8149,1.3401,4.9906,5.4805,2.0339,3.9184,2.2726,5.6226,3.1901,0.6807,3.9606,0.1922,0.9236,8.9158,4.9903,4.5674,0.8542,1.1255,1.7746,4.5955,3.338,0.7884,4.4384,8.7577,7.1722,2.099,8.3868,1.9086,3.5767,0.2882,5.7341,6.1236,3.7753,1.3216,2.3402,1.2688,2.4559,0.6158,3.256,2.0107,0.8958,4.7884,3.036,1.3773,5.2701,3.6771,0.4145,2.6791,7.279,2.4692,3.5332,2.4589,3.8769,0.1028,4.4837,3.1966,3.6748,5.5697,2.527,1.9523,6.24,2.6685,0.0629,5.187,4.0346,4.9187,0.4602,2.8649,2.4911,0.4775,2.4504,2.3689,1.9983,5.7597,3.4337,3.3951,2.1041,0.0138,2.5976,0.417,1.7155,1.1006,3.9614,1.0757,11.3701,0.9461,0.0156,3.3473,5.7999,0.6992,3.0665,3.3233,4.5857,0.8789,0.9724,3.0018,1.1391,3.2153,2.8698,2.7831,3.2715,2.0501,3.8606,0.027,1.4995,2.3053,5.7446,0.1239,0.8498,2.8303,2.0062,1.7734,7.0152,0.6712,2.4909,1.4735,7.3395,4.443,0.2645,6.9743,0.0028,0.0075,2.1638,1.3639,1.8384,5.2746,6.5827,0.1029,0.2389,5.3889,1.1612,3.7562,5.5601,0.6172,0.7573,2.4503,2.3542,2.6874,3.3177,2.2279,3.2198,4.3313,1.054,4.8028,0.1341,1.2275,0.0136,0.2306,0.0463,1.0073,6.8313,0.5267,1.7621,3.2149,2.2146,8.5328,2.0029,3.683,2.5512,4.3862,1.1799,6.607,7.1912,7.5506,2.5373,2.5122,5.2593,1.7451,1.1721,3.1136,7.5893,1.7587,4.4716,1.9368,0.303,1.6218,0.0327,4.8728,0.1039,0.2742,0.8668,8.4888,1.126,5.8546,2.3924,1.284,6.0134,0.3789,1.2357,1.5853,5.9841,2.3254,1.3956,2.8143,5.5122,1.34,6.4199,6.1174,0.0147,4.4483,0.5768,2.9704,7.4039,5.8732,0.6851,1.796,5.793,0.0404,0.452,1.6327,0.63,6.6707,3.8017,3.1987,0.8153,0.6731,6.9797,2.6771,3.7456,3.72,0.7002,1.469,2.7378,0.9106,4.527,4.3125,3.6664,2.3895,0.034,5.5112,3.852,4.437,7.5481,3.077,1.252,1.3465,3.735,3.3483,0.3982,3.6842,2.7542,1.607,3.0396,0.5936,2.2019,3.146,1.8233,3.4984,4.5944,2.5081,4.0231,0.1088,3.6747,0.4928,0.754,4.5267,2.5224,3.9957,4.5046,5.6421,2.6499,0.5224,1.7713,5.0331,0.3966,0.3968,2.9047,2.5932,0.3753,5.3334,1.208,0.3121,5.6262,3.7362,0.3143,2.8427,1.2569,2.0708,1.4774,6.1482,0.7134,3.1481,6.3543,1.9681,5.3395,11.4374,4.9801,0.419,4.7272,9.3448,0.6922,3.8349,0.0101,0.3832,1.3941,2.5768,2.9273,4.4835,5.2005,5.3568,3.1946,7.4595,0.1033,0.2096,1.0844,1.6548,2.8036,1.93,4.4361,1.1945,2.178,0.0829,4.5085,0.8783,1.1409,8.0136,2.6519,4.4289,0.0195,5.8937,4.2794,3.0366,2.0382,0.0024,0.2828,3.4836,4.7192,1.1768,6.4598,2.5104,0.9026,6.1276,2.0091,1.5095,7.6099,4.5052,0.1458,2.3366,3.0018,1.8513,4.7032,0.4801,2.9528,1.0476,5.623,1.1784,3.1807,3.188,1.1619,1.0249,0.0135,2.0315,0.7767,3.5215,5.185,3.1332,4.731,0.1664,5.1343,0.0251,2.5691,5.3946,0.0252,3.524,1.2438,2.241,1.5636,8.0184,2.7819]}

When Kana\u02bbina died, the court claimed and seized them, but they were returned to them by court decision after the trial, and their status with Kana\u02bbina remained unchanged.\n\nFamily\n\nKalaupapa was married to Kahina Kalanui. Kana\u02bbina and his sons were all married into Kalanui families. His son Lualepa was married to his sister Kalaupapa's cousin Teiai.\nIn some early sources, his wife is mentioned as Kalani'omaka, but most of the descriptions of him, that exist, do not mention this family.\nHis son Alaupapa was also a warrior.\n\nDefeat and death\n\nIn 1809, Kana\u02bbina led the army in defense of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi against a combined Russian and American army. Kana\u02bbina had previously been involved in an incident with Russians in 1799, which resulted in the death of several Russians. At the time of the attack by Napoleon's army, Kana\u02bbina was serving as a major in Hawaii's militia. In a fight in the village of Leilani, he and his men were defeated by the Russians and American rebels. Kana\u02bbina was stabbed numerous times with a bayonet, and when he had been shot, his sons were ordered to execute him. He was buried at Vailankanni on the island.\nHis son Kalanuianu then made up a small force and defeated and killed 300 Russian soldiers. He was then captured by the Americans, but escaped and fought on for more than eight years before surrendering his lands back to the United States in 1843.

The virus and its impact is likely to grow and spread as we have seen in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe and, as a result, golf courses will close or have them close for much longer than originally thought. But golfers know how important it is for all of our sport to get through this virus pandemic, and so they have already responded to this challenge by taking measures to keep themselves well, especially when they are out on the course.\nAnd it has been demonstrated over the weekend that golfers and their families are following the advice of many other things which government and public health officials have been advising, as well of course as the recommendations of medical experts who are also advising the public.","token_len":425,"entropy":[9.5009,0.4288,9.1967,0.9748,11.2737,3.9648,3.6846,3.0624,0.4389,9.2161,2.8376,0.0006,1.6153,5.7932,7.511,1.4812,3.2244,1.7585,3.0456,4.7507,0.1573,3.5826,7.3339,2.114,2.5954,2.4385,7.6603,0.0724,0.0014,2.3259,1.8942,12.8179,9.2411,1.6551,8.531,0.2517,6.9264,14.5739,6.5698,10.4558,4.3812,2.42,8.5663,0.2116,1.9364,3.4169,11.1503,5.246,2.2789,0.9926,3.8414,3.222,1.3678,0.1445,1.7453,3.2045,2.1517,6.638,5.8879,4.2684,0.7866,14.0865,2.0706,1.3169,5.0241,0.0115,0.0007,1.0226,1.8171,3.9875,0.9352,3.7931,8.5664,2.0135,4.2099,2.3173,6.0598,2.2269,5.1107,2.317,5.4281,4.0291,0.5667,2.029,2.736,6.5997,6.2252,5.6326,5.0778,1.4631,7.0731,2.469,5.5187,6.9993,6.0542,6.2916,4.0235,2.2982,1.4574,2.6942,0.0755,2.1295,3.1265,3.5365,0.5586,2.3785,0.4541,5.8487,2.6554,4.2281,1.3825,4.2494,1.6467,1.9691,4.0885,3.6367,1.8963,0.7837,3.9934,3.1831,5.6507,3.7111,4.0586,2.3605,1.1414,2.8829,3.7695,1.7766,4.4881,1.7968,3.1403,1.9536,9.6948,0.0267,0.002,9.1205,1.1809,1.3274,0.2155,0.2536,8.3654,4.1816,3.4283,3.2962,4.2653,0.0167,0.0002,6.4044,0.5052,3.965,2.478,2.2691,4.4809,3.0918,2.4745,5.6487,0.6791,0.9894,0.9094,3.6971,2.2552,3.0697,4.969,4.6007,4.8197,1.3132,4.9198,1.6526,1.6127,0.6436,4.7862,3.6294,1.1432,2.2652,0.3891,6.5568,5.0253,3.323,1.4335,4.1748,0.6089,1.5932,6.6666,3.046,3.7146,6.5314,0.1857,0.9122,7.8217,0.1499,3.3424,0.0032,0.0118,0.0026,0.2078,0.0442,0.0066,0.5726,4.469,0.4589,2.5741,1.7855,1.7822,0.5571,2.3721,1.7555,6.435,0.6244,6.5723,7.781,6.3155,4.2751,3.6539,5.7973,0.4099,0.673,2.1906,0.5534,1.5925,3.3259,4.952,1.889,5.9721,2.8853,0.1441,2.0362,12.1571,1.4141,9.8603,3.8306,2.8141,3.7309,2.7666,5.3273,4.2235,0.2533,2.9663,2.012,1.6442,0.6197,6.0507,2.3141,11.7077,5.1542,2.676,1.2136,3.5846,13.4835,0.4754,5.3081,0.0402,2.3033,1.9501,6.5167,4.0062,1.0245,5.4923,3.9762,5.3993,7.4888,2.6823,5.5404,2.2147,3.937,3.6339,6.118,6.5115,2.5138,2.275,5.231,0.0122,0.7468,1.102,4.3118,0.6833,2.9798,5.7781,0.1783,0.4433,3.0556,0.3971,4.051,1.6481,2.0377,4.2444,5.6303,1.3002,5.4359,2.8688,4.4849,0.1822,4.5254,3.0856,0.9721,3.0824,3.0615,3.5363,0.9173,1.3251,1.3142,3.7603,4.1294,1.3187,2.2143,2.7906,1.67,2.1681,4.3069,2.1595,2.2666,0.3046,0.1594,9.2955,3.2828,1.4703,4.8903,3.5609,4.1219,5.1963,4.6431,3.8118,4.8551,0.7665,1.5153,4.8766,3.2551,0.2666,4.7618,4.9606,0.6452,4.5428,3.5447,1.9435,0.8439,0.0808,1.8906,4.5292,0.9051,5.1292,4.196,0.3849,4.5484,3.8825,1.4448,3.3065,9.9788,0.0161,1.5315,0.678,3.6853,2.2338,2.372,4.6232,6.0767,1.4311,2.4301,3.2492,1.4881,2.3199,4.3425,0.5734,2.7891,2.333,4.9935,5.5312,6.3167,2.5169,2.1121,0.988,4.5495,2.1883,0.3286,0.5471,0.5549,0.6331,5.3688,3.0938,2.8845,1.1436,6.0143,4.5102,0.51,5.0558,0.501,2.4964,0.4147,3.4686,1.9529,0.8924,1.1338,6.7063,1.1018,3.5935,0.3366,3.6986,3.9455,6.6679,4.6458,9.8205,2.4376,3.5614,0.3215,0.9059,0.7685,1.9022,4.6611,2.8257,2.6039,0.4025,7.8525,1.0335,4.4171,1.8389,5.3836,0.3201,5.2957,1.2445,2.9249,2.0644,2.9992,4.7085,2.5804,0.8892,1.162]}

The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In the early stages of the manuscript, the chapter headings were very common as they were also the case in other Indian scribes. One can see several examples that were taken from the scribes who wrote in Patanjali\u2019s Sanskrit grammar in the Sreekanthara Upanishad. However, most of the other manuscripts that were written in the early stages were not based on it. In the later stages of the manuscript and onwards, very few of the chapters had titles and in other words only one chapter title is seen in the manuscript. Later, the chapter titles will not appear again, since chapter titles were used only for headings and subheadings of the chapters and the chapter title was followed by the text from the body of the chapter (chapter body text).\nThe chapter headings can be very common in some manuscripts in the initial stages of these books, but in later stages the chapter headings have gone missing and only the chapter titles are used. In some manuscripts, chapter title is seen before chapter body text and this manuscript is mostly similar in nature to other scribes in the later stages of these books. This manuscript is very interesting because of the chapter titles and especially from the scribed chapter title, in the initial stages of these books. The manuscript is also very rare because of the scribed book title and chapter title in the initial stages of these books because few texts that were scribbled in the beginning of these books, are not available in very large quantities or they are not recorded in the Pundit Babu collection (Pundit Babu Collection is one of the significant collections of the manuscripts in Bhakti Siddhanta texts and can be found in Kolkata \/ Kolkata and the Ashram of the Mahatma Gandhi.

He asked the group to propose what they thought he should do to win. \u201cHow would he go about doing it? \u201d asked Nixon. They responded with several alternative strategies.\nDuring the Republican National Convention, Nixon held an unannounced and unprecedented press conference, at a location that was not on the list of official speeches. An audio recording of the press conference was played over both major television networks, with the intention of providing an example of \u201cwhat can happen\u201d during a Democratic presidential campaign if a candidate didn\u2019t respect convention rules.\nFormer Vice President and Secretary of State Dean Acheson is a national figure in the United States, as well as an influential figure in international diplomacy. He was instrumental in the creation of the United Nations, which was intended to prevent future mass murder in conflicts between nations.\nThe US State Department released a statement expressing its support for the \u201cstrong arms embargo\u201d on North Korea \u2013 which it said would prevent \u201cmilitary buildup\u201d and \u201cassistance of the weapons industry. \u201d Meanwhile, The New York Times was critical of the measure.\nNixon announced the release of a blacklist of communist countries that were supporting North Korea. His blacklist would have affected several countries in Asia and Europe, which he felt had failed to implement strict sanctions on North Korea.\nFormer US President Jimmy Carter has written more books than most people can remember.

{"prompt":"Raised as a girl , Cal views himself as a girl who likes other girls . His ability to have a `` feminine gender schema `` despite his having male genes , substantiates the constructionist","text":"Raised as a girl, Cal views himself as a girl who likes other girls. His ability to have a `` feminine gender schema `` despite his having male genes, substantiates the constructionist perspective of gender formation ( Hacker 1997 ).\nCal makes the assumption that only female people understand women's sexuality, as a woman, without knowing that he may actually be doing the same.\nConclusions\nThe analysis of the example of gender dysphoria in Cal's case of gender dysphoria reveals that it remains a clinical condition which is difficult to describe because the individual's body does not align with the expected body for the gender assignment. Some authors have used the label of the body dysphoria syndrome. This is a symptom that is used as a clinical description of transsexualism. It has many authors with a different definition, however, as it is not a formal diagnosis.\nThe individual in this case of gender dysphoria has sought psychological adjustment since he was in primary school. There are a number of different psychological approaches to gender dysphoria and various psychoactive substances were taken, but the individual had stopped all of them when the onset of his current problem.\nThe patient was not aware of his potential problems with his body until he became aware of his body image difficulties. Thus the patient was forced to act in a gender role that he did not want to, which had both physiological and psychological consequences.\nAccording to the data obtained, the patient has a feminized body image and he feels that he is a man. He has felt different in terms of gender role identities but, until now, has not been able to define himself in the way for which he would like to. He has experienced a profound emotional conflict with his family because he wanted to have a male partner, however he found that the family did not want to accept that. He stated that he tried to adjust to his body image by taking psychoactive drugs without success in this case.\nThe main conclusion of this case of gender dysphoria is that it is necessary to provide adequate psychological assistance, with appropriate therapeutic interventions to help the individual integrate his social identity, body image and gender role.","token_len":429,"entropy":[7.8224,5.0898,0.8506,5.1751,0.6906,8.6601,14.8317,2.446,0.166,1.0014,4.9548,2.0925,4.3457,6.5286,0.7227,1.0954,3.345,6.0294,0.147,4.8483,1.3883,12.8926,12.784,6.9242,7.8951,3.8515,8.4305,1.3873,5.172,4.8329,5.7456,2.4905,11.4051,0.1828,2.5084,10.542,5.0619,4.9877,2.2882,3.2135,6.66,4.6054,12.6486,4.9785,0.6335,1.4894,12.2132,6.2478,2.6403,3.6587,0.0706,5.0364,3.6606,3.408,5.484,4.8804,1.2279,4.055,1.8651,3.7986,2.8392,4.9712,3.4104,4.8034,3.9182,1.9454,3.7668,4.6809,4.9487,0.8705,4.9687,2.8259,0.7273,2.2808,3.1775,5.3895,1.4819,0.7676,2.1034,6.4699,0.4963,1.8847,8.8404,1.2601,5.2313,4.8531,0.0077,2.4293,5.5998,1.3333,2.251,6.0869,3.4961,1.0466,0.0199,4.4913,0.7894,3.514,6.4135,1.4511,6.7971,2.2278,3.6315,1.734,4.2238,0.227,4.6219,4.476,2.5005,3.4763,1.9088,3.4693,2.8655,0.03,6.2684,0.2401,1.0826,4.966,2.2956,5.7332,2.0543,3.3535,6.4284,1.038,5.4345,5.2043,1.0192,4.1408,1.1823,5.7969,1.6833,4.1518,5.0496,3.6385,0.5343,5.194,4.069,2.7689,1.3498,1.8368,4.5836,3.2034,1.4795,5.5761,1.8681,0.4083,4.9707,4.2437,0.6383,4.3065,0.3466,1.2657,2.4464,3.0472,4.7572,6.9694,3.6712,2.8105,2.8876,3.8922,2.3112,4.4215,0.6042,3.2281,2.295,0.9121,2.2007,1.8698,6.6975,0.9461,1.23,1.7521,1.8327,5.2989,4.2652,2.2224,0.4657,3.1204,0.3947,0.0035,0.0038,2.0102,7.2801,5.3934,6.0393,5.314,2.8286,0.8721,3.3871,6.3251,0.1552,0.8315,4.2099,1.5584,3.3382,0.3818,0.0129,3.825,3.4771,4.0428,1.0926,2.8875,0.7168,0.0072,2.9252,4.8136,7.1122,3.4517,1.5432,6.0716,4.1161,3.7201,1.9862,1.5265,2.976,4.0654,8.511,5.8371,1.7482,0.6926,3.6333,3.6274,5.4226,0.2016,2.3668,5.8432,5.273,5.2186,2.0129,1.6681,4.5931,2.3737,3.3039,3.2963,0.5559,1.115,6.4332,4.303,2.3042,1.0724,1.3971,3.463,1.0824,3.1884,2.2077,0.1408,0.7323,3.1497,6.2578,8.3675,0.5963,5.631,2.4769,1.8559,1.6831,4.7622,0.1389,5.4147,2.8532,1.1425,4.8214,2.2084,1.9332,1.8323,1.6637,0.0088,2.1478,0.7141,3.6214,2.5618,4.1558,6.1064,6.423,0.1114,0.6765,1.7206,0.5152,1.3384,5.5395,0.0544,1.0678,5.8088,3.396,2.095,1.4208,1.2861,2.2273,2.0184,7.3277,0.5338,0.46,2.0946,1.8199,3.628,4.4084,1.7818,0.7505,0.5892,2.2738,2.5176,1.2227,1.7597,1.7527,5.2426,6.1788,2.9911,4.1472,0.0019,3.8118,3.7858,8.4739,4.5362,4.3168,6.1866,1.4188,0.0606,2.9028,1.2427,1.5511,1.0576,0.0052,3.4729,2.8163,2.3494,2.9759,0.6836,7.6188,0.3451,0.206,3.4877,1.0255,0.5238,0.8771,2.1627,1.3227,4.4092,2.1188,5.3798,4.2438,5.7951,1.0314,0.4344,3.6619,4.0594,1.3753,5.3384,0.2506,2.8999,0.7892,2.881,3.3101,1.5458,5.1808,2.0624,5.2628,1.3811,2.4405,1.9381,2.1164,0.0155,1.7194,1.0668,2.8075,2.9576,2.0768,1.6606,6.889,0.3678,0.6222,6.3365,0.3174,6.2149,1.0429,0.985,1.7911,2.0101,2.516,3.6987,6.3173,0.0259,2.1997,5.7977,3.4558,3.9573,2.8618,3.8437,0.5863,1.0094,1.4344,5.2513,3.6678,1.3465,1.0515,3.2098,1.6481,0.2139,0.0059,0.0046,0.2636,0.1275,1.6752,0.4541,5.4214,0.5592,4.6199,5.2928,1.9822,4.2458,3.5887,4.1003,3.3571,4.9027,2.2037,2.406,1.6656,0.7988,0.6738,5.8914,1.1786,6.1393,2.5218,2.9562,4.2146,0.1583,0.8497,1.215,1.9738,1.4284]}

The project was halted in 1987 by the Somali People's Army, which claimed that most of the work had gone unpaid. A study was done in 1994 to design a new railway line between Mogadishu and Djibouti, the length of which would be increased from 113 km ( 72 mi ) to 140 km ( 88 mi ). The line would be used for freight, but not passenger business. On January 25, 1996, a train from Mogadishu to Djibouti crashed near Banaadir, causing several hundred deaths. The railway was reopened in 2002 after negotiations with the Somalian government.\nIn the late 1960s, Somalis started a nationwide railway revival project called Dheeraj. However, the plans were abandoned as the Somaliland government refused to open its border to foreign aid. The Somaliland government claimed that the revival of the Dheeraj project would place Somaliland's independence at risk and threaten Somaliland's economy. Although no Somalis died when Dheeraj's first shipment of grain arrived in Mogadishu in July 1969, a Somaliland military officer killed a Belgian diplomat in December of the same year and Somalis killed three foreigners in Djibouti in 1972. Somalia was officially closed to aid from the outside world until 1994.\nThere remains a railway link between Djibouti and Jowhar in Banaadir province that was built to move troops and equipment, and this was the only functioning rail link at that time.

By October 4, the system interacted with a mid @ - @ ocean ridge in the Gulf of Panama and a cold front that advanced northward from Baja California.\nOn October 4, the system intensified to hurricane intensity, and then moved rapidly eastward toward the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in the United Sates on 6 October.\nHurricane Fran had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph ( 190 kph), with gusts reaching 145 mph ( 250 kph). This was among the strongest, most active storms that have touched the country since Hurricane Camille in the early 1910s.\nThe hurricane caused a major economic impact in Louisiana, resulting in almost $7 billion in losses. It was the most expensive hurricane in U. S. history during that time, surpassing Irma for the No. 1 spot.\nWhile the storm passed over land, it was weakening. By September 15, the hurricane had weakened considerably, and no landfall was expected. The storm then veered into a very weak and disorganized tropical low pressure system over the Atlantic, and by October 15 was back in the Caribbean basin.\nFollowing Fran's passage, the Atlantic had four prominent tropical systems; however, on 25 September, Nate, a large tropical disturbance formed on the periphery of an upper-level trough that had already formed over the central U.S. A month later, an upper-level trough developed behind another Atlantic storm, Gonzalo.\nBy January, these two storms had organized into four distinct cyclones, two of which became tropical storms. The upper four of the five named Atlantic cyclones, which included Sandy, Matthew, Florence, and Michael, were the first major Atlantic cyclones of the season.\nThey all formed on the front edge of the El Nino weather pattern. The two named storms formed a ridge of pressure over the U. S. The two Atlantic cyclones that made landfall in the United States, Sandy and Michael, were among the wettest Atlantic storms during the past 90 years.","token_len":430,"entropy":[7.1861,11.4231,3.0068,0.7,2.0264,1.5192,11.2825,4.8873,9.0931,1.7054,3.6661,1.8039,0.947,10.0899,0.3381,5.5944,0.0699,5.9346,0.0006,3.7849,3.7271,3.0274,1.1428,5.3048,2.5826,3.0227,0.2099,1.3892,6.208,11.6516,0.1212,2.1814,6.2435,14.2996,6.505,6.8171,6.2211,4.8108,2.4369,0.5568,2.7192,0.1401,6.1032,2.2939,2.85,5.7612,2.026,3.8195,7.3386,2.3189,0.9569,2.6828,6.6604,0.2449,0.1447,2.1027,1.8717,9.1259,0.408,1.8795,0.2235,1.2427,1.9331,6.2784,1.9991,4.4592,1.9009,1.6053,2.4121,3.0442,3.9768,5.8773,2.293,0.1501,2.4253,0.7995,2.4919,0.1565,0.3871,1.7945,4.6373,0.349,1.1004,1.3029,4.9189,6.4764,0.0049,1.4339,8.0405,0.9471,0.305,1.288,4.1495,0.0864,3.2862,4.6127,6.2143,0.3252,0.0447,0.1401,3.9418,0.8136,1.1361,11.6824,1.1422,0.0245,1.2298,2.3787,1.873,0.0585,3.5574,4.4372,0.2136,0.0321,5.141,0.0214,0.0,0.9943,3.6326,1.6949,7.047,0.0543,0.8897,5.5785,1.9627,4.9863,1.644,3.8086,1.7066,4.9953,0.5803,5.7447,1.6254,2.2539,7.8547,1.492,2.0346,3.8959,2.6319,7.4591,0.0244,0.2479,0.8448,1.7774,2.7341,5.4164,2.5066,2.5359,6.189,2.5568,2.1593,6.4379,0.6831,5.8325,0.0129,5.9278,0.2524,4.2428,0.7837,0.3006,2.7001,1.444,3.2654,1.7696,1.5638,3.0187,2.1679,0.6949,1.1318,1.8409,0.0006,6.3891,0.0766,0.024,5.6097,2.2255,0.852,1.2748,4.9339,0.0002,4.6741,4.4952,0.2003,6.686,0.0094,0.6198,4.9133,1.3251,0.5928,5.1897,1.4394,1.89,5.6721,2.8726,6.698,1.3218,1.0887,2.1261,7.9103,3.9974,3.7159,4.3858,3.5474,0.1137,1.4372,2.2608,0.8728,1.9383,5.3511,0.9529,1.8289,6.2041,4.7789,1.0582,0.9246,0.8393,2.3689,1.402,3.9007,7.8411,0.0423,3.2324,2.3972,5.7728,4.2587,3.2617,6.1956,0.7771,4.4956,6.3447,1.2986,0.7829,5.1504,0.8183,2.0482,1.8515,2.3708,4.2021,1.5393,2.389,2.8599,4.4352,1.5648,0.665,3.8889,6.5251,0.5622,0.5805,5.6086,3.6068,0.8311,4.9907,0.7057,1.0863,4.6519,3.7554,7.7175,6.6386,3.1781,4.896,5.3774,6.4457,0.0352,4.979,8.1809,0.9591,0.697,10.0531,3.7024,2.2083,4.4616,2.1785,6.7614,5.9259,2.4853,0.452,7.3156,0.1797,6.6099,4.4302,2.6313,1.5422,3.3634,2.6435,2.8164,3.423,2.0196,2.7709,0.6607,3.9957,4.3309,0.0024,1.0603,0.2161,4.7085,5.754,0.2681,0.1144,3.8246,2.8998,0.2467,0.0197,0.292,3.9603,6.4645,5.3539,6.5071,3.5536,1.2139,9.3634,1.9797,1.59,0.7392,2.9603,4.8962,2.0404,6.3816,2.7816,1.2146,1.184,9.9544,1.5504,3.4908,2.5848,4.2807,0.1927,1.2526,5.4146,0.3344,0.1288,4.6621,3.6134,2.4978,1.2288,1.7623,5.6658,6.729,3.1977,1.6383,3.7912,4.7654,5.8546,0.9386,0.0261,2.3338,2.9031,4.5031,6.2217,0.352,6.8823,0.1904,6.2131,0.3808,0.2427,6.2557,0.3533,1.388,3.1046,2.4926,2.7314,4.7743,2.2612,0.3037,2.7309,0.3483,1.3755,0.5676,0.5699,7.4547,2.5658,2.2611,2.3089,1.0571,6.0505,3.7712,0.0113,1.0688,6.6042,1.6639,0.0057,5.5376,1.1782,1.7259,1.7133,4.4178,4.5883,2.2509,2.4669,3.8326,5.579,2.9599,5.4632,2.0935,0.4448,4.4929,0.0012,1.3112,0.1932,4.0762,3.8591,6.2455,1.0911,0.0448,2.8285,4.865,0.7236,1.5395,1.1437,3.3227,0.0066,2.7377,3.0407,0.1566,2.9686,0.0837,1.4958,6.4387,0.1277,7.8285,0.0098,0.0001,4.5689,0.6967,4.2158,0.5239,3.2734,5.553,1.6616,0.3333]}

He was close friends of The Beatles, but had few relationships with the other two members of the group. In 1972, he attended his first All Starr show, and maintained a friendship with Starr by hanging out with his family until Harrison died. In 1993, he attended The Beatles'Reunion concert, and after it ended he said of it \" I was surprised to notice the Beatles were there - I was actually surprised to notice them. \"\nLennon's relationships with women also varied over time. The Beatles \" sex scandal \" in 1969 contributed to his break up with Ringo Starr. Later, he and Yoko Ono broke up. In April 1973, she married a Japanese doctor in Hawaii. The ensuing custody fight in the United States resulted in The Beatles'divorce in September 1973, but the couple reunited in the United States in 1975. The two eventually fell apart permanently in 1980. In the early 1960s he first met Cynthia Powell. They were married for four years. In 1969, Lennon began a relationship with Marianne Faithfull. By 1973 she was no longer interested in him. A few years later, Lennon dated British actress \/ singer \/ performer Julie Christie. The two were not very much together as well, and after some time they parted ways. Around 1992, he began to hang out with the actress \/ singer \/ performer Samantha Taylor. They were not romantically involved, but he seemed to genuinely care about her wellbeing. In 1996, he first met British writer Penelope Wilton, who was with him to do some promoting for the album Double Fantasy. She proposed marriage, and he accepted. They tied the knot in 1997, but broke up in 2001. The British writer Joan Baez was later reported to have been his love interest in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From 1991 until his death, he seemed to be more interested in his wife, and his relationship with her was not broken up after his divorce from Yoko Ono.","token_len":430,"entropy":[5.4746,8.3315,0.1013,8.9498,4.9724,8.6756,5.3958,4.3346,1.1037,3.5004,3.3227,1.2522,6.1668,0.1919,15.5994,17.6896,7.1461,4.3642,8.6317,3.5684,5.2302,0.8294,6.1732,3.1646,5.7764,0.2385,3.905,1.0107,4.6783,8.1709,1.6245,2.9546,1.8069,2.9672,3.04,4.8223,5.6358,0.4161,2.3001,2.3582,3.3168,4.869,3.7857,0.189,1.817,3.1768,2.9716,2.0711,0.9726,0.3097,1.6531,0.7157,2.6887,3.3565,0.4464,1.9231,5.2465,4.6389,0.4911,6.6995,5.7278,3.759,1.7419,2.3077,8.7543,0.8184,3.3547,0.0405,3.6047,5.6068,5.5652,0.1834,0.7544,3.1405,4.3671,5.1167,4.6657,2.9389,1.4556,2.4272,5.0096,0.1563,1.0114,2.759,3.1139,1.8788,1.3202,12.5918,0.3075,2.7233,1.7357,1.0911,6.2703,5.6979,2.9919,2.3506,5.0344,3.6851,5.7035,3.0142,6.0016,2.6034,4.9897,1.6462,7.745,2.6575,3.0316,1.7422,5.0799,4.6055,2.3123,1.9463,4.9655,2.3205,1.0849,3.8691,2.6735,2.1424,1.7261,3.0825,7.7713,0.0088,0.0002,1.8576,4.6982,0.0463,7.0343,3.8228,1.0564,4.4556,0.9909,0.4301,3.7355,2.1433,6.5539,8.7747,3.5917,2.4528,2.8806,2.9931,6.208,0.2539,1.9393,6.1334,2.0349,0.1471,5.6177,0.0164,0.139,1.3419,5.2351,1.0713,1.4288,3.7484,8.0398,0.0156,0.2521,0.0011,4.1149,0.0522,2.9607,2.0421,5.8515,3.0146,0.1298,4.4659,3.2833,3.8844,6.2539,6.3652,3.882,4.179,1.0864,2.5333,6.1548,6.4414,4.6841,3.5978,2.3472,1.7674,0.0357,2.3185,0.0169,5.2454,0.1414,12.7913,10.808,5.0228,3.1832,3.9871,1.3226,1.6687,2.8095,2.0194,1.2282,5.004,1.0634,3.2679,1.7204,0.1819,1.013,3.4888,0.4606,2.8269,3.3564,3.4114,6.1195,3.7834,7.5363,1.2286,3.6343,0.9076,2.059,3.3407,1.8462,5.7551,0.0417,3.9024,6.433,1.0314,7.6657,6.4172,2.7619,2.9063,2.2038,0.8924,2.9757,3.3808,0.4183,2.2016,1.6877,3.5747,0.3438,2.4539,4.4855,2.6427,0.5871,0.0164,7.1126,0.5982,1.8458,0.2893,1.378,5.4691,3.6122,2.8664,0.6893,7.1701,0.0482,5.1677,0.0787,2.2464,0.9854,4.7489,1.4422,0.7336,0.1354,0.4261,2.1845,5.7409,6.6977,1.5183,9.8306,2.6282,3.6439,5.3075,5.2581,3.9048,0.7319,2.6974,2.2613,2.5594,5.8091,3.6489,3.3033,3.9772,4.568,4.4272,1.0779,1.8836,4.178,4.8097,1.6899,2.4479,3.696,0.6493,1.022,6.6934,6.1139,0.2848,1.727,3.4167,1.718,5.4577,0.0987,0.1499,3.1728,3.2856,4.4174,0.5961,0.7141,0.6705,8.7221,5.6929,0.7809,2.7839,2.0747,4.2901,5.837,0.0033,0.3915,2.5164,0.8692,2.4125,5.284,0.4362,5.9648,2.8002,1.1163,0.3622,7.4841,0.5851,1.7508,3.0641,0.1863,0.8468,5.4965,0.335,4.3903,4.1287,9.7047,0.0327,5.4,3.2034,1.4458,0.8541,1.6278,5.4196,1.2194,6.1435,4.6424,3.4372,8.9695,0.6675,1.6643,4.0344,8.4098,6.2828,0.5306,2.656,7.1344,5.719,2.8503,0.7678,2.0093,2.8559,0.7052,3.1906,8.0523,0.4374,0.0024,0.4626,2.3382,0.9091,2.1749,5.8123,0.036,0.8145,3.3634,0.3291,3.2041,6.3327,2.9435,9.0228,3.404,0.0066,2.4524,4.1207,4.2266,0.4077,0.193,1.8497,3.5101,4.1726,0.1911,2.1833,1.5041,3.6543,3.5132,0.0135,1.7928,0.2752,0.1014,0.0003,0.3521,6.1564,4.9162,3.3463,1.6944,0.2824,1.3911,1.4298,5.8025,0.3738,1.256,3.9553,2.3671,0.0222,2.2005,1.6132,2.0616,2.9994,2.8823,0.831,0.0899,0.5765,2.3524,2.7651,5.9131,0.7571,5.4311,1.6482,4.4817,1.3066,4.0416,0.0018,0.7227,0.0006,0.7308]}

Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and","text":"The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was not obliged to hold a conclave to determine the canon of the chapter. Other times the title of chapter of bishops would be conferred on a church of a specific type, such as that of bishops of the East. Some of the more important dioceses were divided into chapters and, in some areas, chapter bishops were elected out of the chapters. In the Middle Ages the dioceses of Canterbury, York and Winchester had a chapter of bishops. In the East, the hierarchy was largely dependent on the papacy for support, although in Eastern Europe chapters were also formed out of the bishops and in the Catholic church they served as collegiate episcopal bodies of bishops.\nA chapter of bishops is not necessarily an independent synodal or diocesan governing body. Sometimes the head of diocese was the titular head, and the chapter was only required to report to the metropolitan bishop. In other cases the chapter merely reported to the metropolitan, and they could exercise functions that were traditionally reserved for other archbishops; their function of providing a permanent diocesan cadre of officials was replaced by appointment of officials more often than not by the metropolitan himself. The chapter was also not always an ecclesiastical authority: sometimes they were simply ecclesiastical auxiliaries to bishops or abbacies. The chapter as such was not a full-fledged Church of England synod, nor for that matter was it an independent medieval bishops\u2019 conference. In fact, the chapter of bishops was not a formal corporate body of bishops and the function it performed was that of a diocesan secretariat in the hands of the bishop. However, the chapter of bishops had become in practice, because of the need of ecclesiastical governance in an increasingly centralized state, a more central element in the ecclesiastical organization.

Southwestern finished the season with a 22-11 victory over Miami.\nSouthwestern started up the scoring early, as quarterback Jamee Harris took the puck deep into UT territory from a long pass from QB Jason Davis and found wide receiver Evan Sands in the endzone. From there Southwestern just didn't run away with the game, as UT got a field goal late in the first half to go up 15-7. Southwestern wouldn't give up that early lead again until UT pulled them back to within three points at 28-25 at the half.\nIn the second half UT would extend their lead to 17 points, but Southwestern rallied and scored two late touchdowns to cut their lead down to three. Southwestern would push it to within two when UT couldn't convert on the third down conversion, but Southwest would lose to UT 38-3.","token_len":433,"entropy":[10.0055,3.9108,5.8535,0.6638,11.4028,0.0754,1.4807,0.8071,3.0399,14.7079,8.3025,9.9463,13.5203,11.394,3.2962,6.165,1.2336,2.2725,6.3564,0.868,1.89,1.3393,10.2536,2.3858,1.3602,3.8676,0.0165,3.9408,3.9929,2.461,6.3182,7.0341,0.0892,3.9237,0.0783,6.7892,2.1033,2.5935,4.4143,1.7606,0.7975,5.3088,3.0902,4.0253,1.9234,0.4552,0.0257,3.8624,1.9461,1.5791,0.0083,0.3361,2.1019,10.6333,7.6938,0.0418,6.0124,1.6668,1.0958,1.9331,0.9711,2.519,7.0604,1.5644,4.866,0.5351,2.1741,0.0,1.9881,3.974,6.1809,3.7589,5.369,0.2207,3.724,5.7197,2.0562,0.4592,1.919,5.4568,3.6143,3.8381,3.7255,1.149,3.3956,4.7254,8.5619,4.3636,2.5763,0.61,3.905,4.9193,6.9607,4.2138,1.9089,1.0202,11.4151,5.371,2.6271,4.2767,2.3117,0.1357,5.1816,0.0178,0.4743,1.3256,3.1901,2.0958,0.3869,1.3554,0.9799,1.3374,5.113,0.2455,4.9536,6.6352,4.7264,0.0151,4.0462,1.2419,5.2715,3.4922,0.005,3.9218,3.193,3.0761,9.2611,3.1346,0.3563,7.2433,3.1495,2.1079,0.0091,3.7503,4.7305,7.3221,0.4634,4.6906,9.6174,0.8788,1.2404,5.5463,6.826,0.4592,0.5512,0.2082,0.1221,11.3574,3.467,1.6531,2.3569,7.3173,4.3654,2.7781,2.9095,5.3659,1.1931,5.6493,2.8625,0.3614,6.4137,0.0517,2.7537,1.2586,4.5519,3.6859,2.7518,0.7693,2.4537,2.4064,1.9948,2.1582,5.0847,0.579,0.0265,0.2421,0.0045,3.4334,1.4975,1.3566,1.0564,0.8481,2.3852,3.0133,1.157,2.6426,0.5528,0.0216,1.9458,1.2389,7.1693,1.3249,0.2555,0.5106,4.9231,8.7149,6.3291,3.893,5.323,3.2459,8.6368,8.0036,7.009,1.3203,1.5031,5.8939,5.6246,4.9619,4.5658,3.6671,0.2681,8.0625,0.8934,8.2889,10.1437,0.0476,1.7958,0.056,4.1963,0.0012,3.8591,0.0069,1.5383,0.2449,4.9067,7.8283,5.45,0.1879,2.5018,0.106,2.9421,0.053,3.0516,0.0023,1.4673,1.5472,1.5792,4.6046,2.252,1.0189,3.9825,4.2751,0.6439,1.0122,5.4865,1.3553,2.0647,6.9195,3.434,4.2623,0.0349,0.5892,6.474,3.9955,2.8813,0.5484,6.4274,0.203,1.7434,7.1774,2.745,5.8524,1.5279,2.2532,1.1892,0.4697,5.4584,1.2308,3.6756,5.0211,0.3432,4.9617,1.368,1.3757,3.4846,0.0538,4.5335,7.3386,1.671,3.7722,3.212,1.5434,2.4845,4.8451,4.4987,2.3788,4.0888,5.297,3.9414,1.7501,8.7652,2.934,1.5398,6.1197,1.4908,5.1072,2.4964,4.9715,2.364,1.9005,6.6505,6.3927,5.5555,2.9865,4.9833,6.3097,0.8128,5.6628,9.414,2.9886,0.3549,0.7623,1.9877,0.5806,6.1263,2.0301,5.392,0.0036,6.4148,4.5622,0.0019,4.6718,4.101,1.3279,0.5005,1.0732,1.4043,1.087,1.5789,3.595,2.1762,2.6243,0.0044,4.8262,0.2323,0.0246,1.8745,0.4355,1.328,5.031,0.7804,3.8425,0.083,1.8514,0.6304,3.0293,0.0036,8.4308,0.0023,4.2314,0.2328,3.9663,2.3952,0.903,4.1907,1.8205,3.5442,4.5447,4.8049,1.6865,1.4271,0.7433,3.2942,0.9875,2.02,7.0999,0.4367,3.0631,3.1988,0.4206,0.8149,0.2774,0.5611,3.3358,0.2031,1.2607,0.2199,2.0505,4.2491,6.6041,0.7218,0.0436,0.4294,3.2344,4.0173,1.632,0.7809,2.2183,0.0015,6.563,2.5173,3.7544,3.524,4.1118,0.9743,0.9642,5.2966,2.7488,0.2891,4.4904,0.0409,3.5265,1.5422,2.4391,0.0012,1.2896,5.1605,3.3824,1.0155,6.2015,2.2335,3.6735,2.9323,6.1322,0.0007,3.6196,1.3475,1.9745,3.1227,2.2016,6.463,1.9084,1.1179,9.111,1.5695,6.8947,2.799,2.9673,4.6049,0.053,4.1602,0.7776]}

In June 1959, Illinois and Indiana designated two stretches of state highways with the name I @ - @ 94 as the old I @ - @ 80. In January 1960, US 10, the St. Louis Interstate, was renumbered I @ - @ 94, with I @ - @ 93 retaining its original name.\nOn April 28. 1960, an agreement was reached to provide a highway over the Mississippi River at the head of the Ohio. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had made a preliminary design for highway over the Mississippi River. The highway design did not include an interchange with existing US 4 or US 50. There were many problems with the original design, and on or about June 1970, the decision was made to move ahead with road construction on its own.

Common fish species eaten include anchovies, lantern fish, pilchards, sculpins, hakes, horse mackerel, < unk > and horse mackerel, mackerel, mullet, and sardines.\nDolphin feeding rates are largely dependent on local availability of foods. As they prefer to stay near inshore waters, dolphins feed almost exclusively on schooling fish. Dolphins also feed on squid, cephalopods, and fishes, as well as carrion. Some populations also have been known to feed on sea birds and shellfish, including oysters and clams. Dolphins show opportunistic feeding behavior and can also feed on invertebrates such as amphipods and barnacles, and small worms and copepods.\nMost Dolphins can be found in marine waters during the day and prefer to feed or rest underwater during the day. Some dolphins show preferences to feeding on certain types of fishes and squid, such as blue whiting (Micromesistius punctatus or M. antarcticus), herring, capelin, squid, and krill, and have been reported to feed on more than 200 species of fish. Other populations, however, appear to be less specialized and feed on a much lower number of species. Mostly, they feed on a wider variety of fish and squid species.\nAlthough most Dolphins prefer to feed at night, it may not exclusively be an all-day event. Dolphins in several populations have been noted to feed during the day. For example, a captive bottlenose dolphin population in the North Sea feeds at night. However, most populations have a diurnal feeding pattern that is closely correlated with the feeding schedule of the prey species. For example, a bottlenose dolphin population in the Gulf of Mexico feeds most commonly during dusk to dusk. It has been also reported that a dolphin species in the Indo-Pacific region feeds a maximum of 12 hours per day. Most Dolphins are usually sighted close to shore, but occasional sightings of dolphins has been reported hundreds of nautical miles from land.","token_len":435,"entropy":[11.8048,12.9464,9.1505,12.271,2.4468,1.8795,0.0017,2.4961,1.9518,5.1529,3.3978,1.7441,7.383,3.5761,3.243,8.6181,1.5111,5.1638,0.1129,0.1727,9.0321,2.6351,0.1725,8.7664,3.2155,0.9869,0.1359,5.1102,6.3026,3.176,0.1564,7.4259,4.9274,0.159,8.5118,6.535,0.0779,0.0012,0.2996,12.7961,10.2942,5.1002,5.0252,2.5644,7.2332,1.8478,0.0215,0.004,1.6772,5.7901,0.034,0.0021,0.9157,7.8919,0.6261,0.4521,1.9348,5.2098,0.4992,0.2091,0.2068,2.0123,12.452,2.7599,4.8955,5.2355,1.4861,5.4594,2.5213,0.1378,4.9152,4.6852,0.8761,6.1934,1.7798,4.7452,5.3277,5.3752,1.785,3.3636,3.3034,11.8734,1.9076,0.0256,2.834,0.5521,1.357,3.3533,5.0238,0.0885,0.2982,9.8146,1.0208,1.5693,3.7348,2.1372,1.5368,0.5013,4.0131,0.6627,5.3265,0.8567,0.0007,0.0193,0.1164,0.2416,1.2926,5.8708,2.2017,2.5098,0.0921,0.0092,8.625,0.3669,0.0077,2.5149,4.8506,4.3441,3.5779,3.9712,3.4978,2.9914,0.0172,0.8425,0.2225,4.5132,4.4332,1.6051,5.531,0.0076,1.4986,2.1136,5.4204,0.0975,1.4732,5.1057,0.0078,0.3018,2.8326,6.9859,7.8727,0.0395,3.0042,1.4054,2.6459,3.4437,3.2598,2.577,0.2999,4.4836,0.0001,0.0839,0.8376,0.003,6.2676,0.1028,0.0525,1.2936,6.9768,0.0842,2.0241,2.3734,4.0714,6.4991,1.8712,8.3811,0.115,0.0074,0.3847,0.9884,4.9588,4.9357,4.6785,0.6582,0.9894,0.8386,5.5498,3.1816,6.3589,0.8618,2.2873,1.441,8.181,1.0588,4.3315,6.098,4.9683,5.9181,3.5334,0.2298,2.4847,0.2906,4.1865,2.8462,5.4357,6.316,2.7451,5.3931,0.8441,5.0036,1.9515,0.0055,4.0678,2.2228,2.7181,0.9177,1.3013,0.0024,4.8631,7.2945,2.6629,2.8566,8.4553,1.9853,5.8428,7.9422,6.3423,7.3513,0.8415,5.6835,4.2978,0.7793,9.1586,5.4895,1.9713,0.1465,0.6319,7.1589,0.0961,1.238,6.8853,2.1015,0.6889,4.253,0.4744,1.3142,5.3488,0.3124,2.3643,1.3792,5.0379,1.7386,2.7445,0.2136,0.9308,0.2782,5.4394,0.461,3.6329,0.6117,0.1971,1.9162,1.3379,3.9388,5.0196,2.8309,3.2365,0.0034,5.0568,0.1512,1.507,2.4171,4.9836,1.6099,3.4814,1.4465,2.2928,3.569,2.6886,2.4869,0.0328,1.185,0.9528,8.0219,0.7391,2.8894,1.488,0.4424,3.1381,5.7563,0.7027,0.0023,1.6129,1.5775,0.2787,2.4756,1.4547,0.9165,4.5602,2.7416,1.7036,3.2801,0.7448,2.2454,3.8726,0.4503,0.2812,4.0893,2.9077,3.7723,12.0188,0.4971,4.0137,5.5531,0.5782,1.1611,4.4434,0.3652,1.9578,4.2686,6.4357,3.6967,2.3743,0.6689,4.4062,0.2247,1.1222,3.1802,0.6114,0.6227,2.2952,3.5762,0.3012,0.0143,2.8265,6.6703,6.6698,0.0118,0.001,0.0067,5.5602,1.4287,1.4368,4.9639,2.716,6.7771,2.5103,0.2005,1.7952,3.4933,0.0093,3.7232,3.5343,2.3853,3.4153,7.4708,0.0074,0.828,1.4542,2.5035,1.4237,5.8606,3.8411,0.3074,1.3041,4.0672,3.1817,1.2281,1.2365,5.2658,1.9749,0.4867,3.4663,0.3854,0.0046,1.5032,4.8498,0.0021,0.0017,0.2329,1.304,0.3152,0.4178,2.4893,0.1274,0.4964,1.0531,5.5214,4.5137,1.5065,6.9063,2.7092,3.6136,0.9166,4.2622,3.0215,0.6587,5.9278,1.4501,0.2955,1.8333,2.1413,4.8286,1.6903,0.5025,6.9252,0.099,0.0413,2.3775,0.586,5.1337,5.7201,0.2852,3.9664,1.5772,1.459,0.2406,1.069,5.051,2.6151,2.0384,4.8571,6.1991,0.0303,6.1142,0.098,0.9716,1.9201,1.2278,6.3092,1.9504,1.9538,1.2131,7.4269,0.4996,0.4081,9.2327,0.0393,8.0313,0.0032,0.0082,2.5676,4.9419,0.3864]}

When are you able to stop thinking about work and start thinking about your hobbies again? What are your plans for the weekend? (and the months, and the years?\nI love your last paragraph- especially reading it after seeing some of the tweets I was doing this morning and realizing that it felt so wrong to be looking ahead and not now\u2026I\u2019ve been able to slow down the pace of my life in some ways, to find some time for myself and to live in the present, but I still get a kick out of \u201cplaning\u201d for something I\u2019m excited about (or hoping is coming!) and just hope that I can make it happen.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.4543,5.8565,7.7685,8.67,4.5038,12.9251,12.744,5.355,5.9088,6.4318,3.337,0.9956,0.5003,1.4004,7.1523,2.4936,7.2701,9.1587,0.7027,6.6429,11.8245,4.3517,6.0372,4.6784,1.0214,7.4252,1.8804,3.8267,11.9638,1.5505,2.669,1.222,3.9292,4.7266,0.3521,0.2545,0.5149,1.8364,2.7357,1.1149,4.5635,4.6032,3.3412,1.0031,0.8093,0.3616,2.4876,3.0257,2.5431,6.95,1.3401,6.1103,5.6793,6.9856,1.0954,2.6844,0.5542,7.6129,0.7673,2.8937,2.5425,2.451,0.1994,1.5105,1.6458,5.1203,3.9007,5.1519,2.0906,1.8772,4.827,0.6368,0.6472,0.4183,0.7372,5.2916,0.7499,0.769,0.1054,0.1744,6.9012,3.9206,3.7867,8.7681,3.7028,4.4204,5.4717,7.7902,2.2906,7.3085,13.8691,7.201,3.9773,4.5105,2.0664,7.9218,2.0859,4.3448,4.2868,3.7975,4.1872,7.1743,0.7346,3.8392,2.028,2.2819,0.1819,3.9503,5.2751,1.4929,5.1694,2.5382,0.3879,3.124,5.489,2.0904,6.7146,0.4883,0.9565,3.8594,0.0558,1.6511,3.9757,6.1434,3.8307,1.6857,3.1288,0.778,5.0295,1.7963,1.2195,0.4814,0.1248,8.5176,1.7186,1.3835,1.9829,1.7575,2.9431,0.149,3.2574,4.9234,0.9427,6.6614,0.663,4.8078,2.7436,2.0815,2.7283,3.3517,0.8136,2.8589,8.4727,2.1468,7.3825,5.0385,5.6025,0.745,6.383,0.8025,1.0339,2.7623,1.0703,0.3182,2.1684,3.2863,2.0569,3.6846,2.849,0.3829,1.8978,0.2572,1.9109,5.8279,0.1255,2.4991,4.0281,3.5872,6.6178,2.0114,2.2741,0.932,1.826,9.6985,0.8942,8.0295,3.8943,0.5865,1.2489,3.0795,2.6342,4.0935,5.0364,0.3801,1.4243,2.0663,0.6932,1.9155,4.7599,1.929,6.3186,6.5666,1.2244,2.6871,1.9044,2.3429,0.0344,2.93,1.6623,1.7385,1.1185,0.1063,0.9363,1.0596,3.5712,0.3284,0.9591,0.0094,0.0129,0.8443,4.5151,0.6034,2.8561,0.056,0.2803,7.8075,4.6453,4.4693,3.3397,0.7162,0.9836,2.3479,2.5219,5.0728,5.8253,6.7325,1.9553,3.7326,1.839,4.4432,4.4681,1.1042,2.3912,3.5692,0.7622,1.0331,4.2102,6.5202,3.5351,2.8462,3.2973,7.899,2.7785,2.0528,4.8129,0.0316,2.0541,1.0503,4.7942,3.4254,7.2251,2.2815,4.6338,4.7718,6.0797,4.6117,1.4468,4.1935,0.7773,2.8299,0.1583,2.2123,2.0199,1.9683,0.1711,0.0018,4.6484,2.9451,2.9485,3.4706,3.0039,4.6092,3.6013,1.5079,0.487,1.2515,1.6815,5.4342,1.7106,0.3004,3.7775,2.1784,3.9751,5.8284,5.2846,0.6198,5.228,3.2362,0.2721,2.7612,0.0169,4.4143,2.5169,0.302,6.0246,1.1216,2.5803,1.2269,0.0552,1.8475,5.0028,5.3584,0.1613,3.1454,1.9022,1.226,3.3021,0.3185,0.8737,3.9487,0.2316,5.3531,4.3398,4.1789,7.4056,3.9587,3.0269,1.7181,0.7189,5.2217,4.7057,1.3119,5.0376,5.8195,5.8086,4.3028,6.0447,5.9365,6.5336,2.0149,4.7354,4.9583,3.4058,0.7551,0.8381,5.9312,2.3917,4.4325,4.3723,2.9089,1.7039,3.2265,5.009,0.9831,2.2619,6.0596,2.3806,3.4192,0.597,3.0164,4.7684,4.2669,2.3768,2.4034,5.9067,5.3624,3.5601,3.5365,0.3019,1.6094,1.0183,5.2919,0.0054,6.3874,0.2426,3.7312,3.4645,1.022,0.7542,1.3361,3.9186,2.6327,0.6275,1.2717,3.9405,4.4494,2.5534,2.096,1.8543,1.7181,1.7314,1.7028,5.6806,2.2761,1.92,1.5112,2.0157,1.9953,1.3648,3.025,4.6548,1.6961,5.1476,0.0653,0.0039,12.3156,4.9788,7.8163,5.6093,7.1723,5.9582,4.6503,4.1296,2.1418,5.1536,0.1638,1.337,4.5251,0.1915,4.159,3.1789,4.9005,5.1076,2.7348,4.6308,1.565,4.528,5.2285,1.0119,1.7523,1.0762,3.1079,0.9749,3.284,0.8581]}
{"prompt":"The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone","text":"The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When he originally heard about the project, he thought it would be a light tone of game. However, Sakimoto later said that the game would be a combination of old and new, and be able to capture the atmosphere of both the original game and the PS4 games. To that end, the music for the game was arranged in such a way that players would know what the game is about, but it could also be mixed with new elements. Sakimoto said, \u201c For the music of Valkyria Revolution, I wanted to create songs that capture the feeling of the original games. When I heard the music, I thought that I was not able to recreate that feeling again, because things were fixed to the point that the games could be played the way they were in the PC era. As I have always maintained that the game must have a light touch, I felt that I had to create a set of songs that could capture that feeling \u201d.\nThe gameplay for the original Valkyria Chronicles game was made into light gun shooters, and that was done because of what Sakimoto wanted out of the games. There were no guns in the original games, and Sakimoto wanted to build a balance system for the player to have a variety of weapons at their disposal. \u201c The original games were the point and shoot type of game. I also wanted to create gameplay that is very light, where the player should have a feeling that they are shooting someone on the screen, and they are not using heavy guns \u201d Sakimoto explained. Sakimoto revealed that Valkyria Revolution would be able to capture the feeling of the original games. \u201cI still want to create songs that fit the old gameplay. The first thing is to create songs that give the player some feeling for the world being played in the game. And from there, I create songs that give the player a variety of feelings. So, I like to create songs that can be played as is, but can also be mixed together in other ways, \u201d Sakimoto explained.","token_len":436,"entropy":[8.3735,2.5372,5.0348,0.3778,8.697,1.3928,4.3974,3.8691,1.1143,1.2161,3.3482,3.5998,1.2716,0.7471,1.4653,4.2994,6.8125,4.4833,0.4151,0.0479,1.9993,0.6139,5.4909,2.0988,6.559,3.5668,1.667,0.7318,2.4766,0.2767,0.3156,2.9075,0.9152,1.0232,0.248,1.3827,8.0075,9.1753,4.2633,5.0135,1.9688,2.535,0.048,4.0933,0.0065,3.64,3.2273,0.746,1.5961,1.9935,1.7985,0.9682,2.1628,5.0791,0.0706,5.2547,1.065,0.0444,3.1381,1.2522,7.214,4.8434,0.0017,5.354,0.9857,2.7337,0.3325,5.0186,1.9805,1.6101,2.2269,0.1035,0.5885,6.4641,2.1672,5.0027,0.3933,5.7326,3.0225,0.1725,0.0552,1.6269,2.1883,2.071,0.527,0.7297,0.5727,5.3514,2.9082,3.1701,0.0508,0.0557,0.2227,4.9134,1.1773,4.8748,1.6099,1.9541,2.4902,3.8767,0.7657,1.3924,2.8776,2.4689,3.7588,1.2702,0.4418,5.9669,1.2138,3.5698,2.6968,1.2628,3.7438,0.0026,2.1259,2.9402,12.3251,6.8571,8.1233,1.2945,1.9856,3.0513,1.4126,0.0026,0.0024,9.5027,0.3334,2.6801,2.1812,0.3764,2.2817,5.2715,0.5687,5.9981,0.3293,2.2205,0.1523,0.7684,1.5646,2.2255,1.1569,4.3952,0.6902,2.261,1.4611,1.8071,1.632,0.3421,1.8798,1.8506,2.6554,3.0821,4.8206,3.0303,0.0023,3.6025,3.1203,0.4693,6.2486,1.4023,2.9315,7.3931,1.4059,8.159,3.8585,1.0716,3.6716,1.5712,1.8395,5.5049,3.2025,2.1168,1.9212,5.3311,1.8437,0.2318,0.6656,2.575,0.4028,8.4174,2.3061,0.411,4.0393,2.2748,4.3141,3.6245,4.8548,1.678,1.4511,2.0798,3.8449,2.2273,1.1383,4.9059,5.4544,0.7905,0.8454,3.0546,0.3654,1.6521,1.7847,0.3445,2.2104,1.1235,6.7698,0.3184,1.3171,0.432,2.2858,2.1172,1.6795,0.5993,6.4749,6.8173,3.8923,1.8597,7.7343,5.2174,3.2185,1.0437,3.9969,0.8012,0.001,0.0028,0.2512,3.3726,0.8863,5.146,5.1076,7.4818,8.961,5.2413,1.4859,1.7551,4.2134,1.4431,3.3709,4.7181,1.3847,5.1329,1.9436,0.0035,3.5281,5.2185,0.0267,0.507,3.804,0.4134,4.4745,0.9349,2.4125,4.7638,1.1619,0.4086,0.6993,2.0867,0.4193,1.4304,3.8291,0.0018,2.2647,0.6949,5.371,1.2535,7.7518,7.6766,2.6449,0.8008,3.5921,1.6796,2.7354,1.887,4.1917,0.1339,0.8997,4.3128,1.4278,0.0081,0.5597,7.6388,0.9913,2.1046,3.287,1.8043,1.473,4.8895,6.933,3.3504,2.0057,4.3718,1.302,2.1697,2.4067,4.4051,4.1121,0.5027,0.351,1.8096,5.6718,0.8662,3.5369,3.1876,3.0678,1.7089,5.6838,1.1917,0.6109,4.7363,2.2256,1.3856,5.261,2.7254,1.2145,0.665,3.5614,6.1779,4.5237,1.1753,4.9791,1.188,1.2513,2.9898,2.4518,1.7837,4.4193,5.7209,4.3166,6.4967,2.2979,10.9953,0.0013,3.6708,1.5738,5.932,0.0026,6.5127,0.3368,4.5996,0.001,0.004,0.421,2.6431,0.8608,3.7533,0.0021,3.6154,0.9609,1.1573,0.1416,0.9738,0.5898,0.4534,3.0052,4.3271,0.0777,7.6997,5.6313,2.5164,0.2222,1.8734,4.3805,0.4098,7.5518,1.0069,5.2882,4.7166,2.1666,2.483,3.324,3.6704,3.0923,1.2556,1.5045,2.9018,0.2791,4.7474,0.7542,0.5284,3.8029,3.5482,3.5386,0.6819,4.068,7.0276,3.6439,2.7112,1.034,1.5232,0.6029,4.4362,5.8427,1.0362,0.364,0.8766,6.1701,1.4368,0.2872,2.7432,0.5132,0.2251,1.1434,5.9621,0.0655,4.0788,1.4676,3.1186,1.4303,1.7875,4.8987,0.7736,1.2723,0.6916,0.2034,3.2021,1.3695,1.0173,3.1841,6.8299,1.1632,1.9554,3.7744,0.4878,0.4849,2.5955,4.5841,3.254,2.9909,0.4497,2.464,5.5649,3.0358,1.2734,0.0013,0.8264,0.0313]}

The album was only","text":"Following years of preparation, Jackson's debut album Centipede was distributed in October 1984 by CBS Records, who had signed her as a solo artist two years previously. The album was only moderately successful but Jackson became a well-known performer, appearing on television shows like Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show, as a guest on a number of radio shows such as The Alan Jackson Show and Fantasy FM, and appearing at Live Aid on July 22, 1985. In October 1986, the album Cleo received critical acclaim.\nThere would be another record release in 1986, however, which would be the defining moment of Alan Jackson's career. In September 1986 Jackson released the album \" Alan Jackson \". The lead single of that album, \" I Just Wanna Be With You \", has since become the most successful single ever written by an American woman. The album was recorded in Nashville along with other noted artists, including Kenny Rogers, Elvis Presley, Smokey Robinson, The Carpenters, The Beatles, Tom Jones and Frank Sinatra. Following the release of \" I Just Wanna Be With You \", Jackson's career would take off after her release of another album in August 1986, entitled \" Heartbreak Hotel \". With Heartbreak Hotel, Jackson's music found its place again on college campuses for both college and high schoolers, with a young audience that was receptive to a pop music style that seemed to be less serious than that of her previous music. She'd become the first female artist to top the pop charts in Japan under her own name, with the song \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry Again\", an English version of the Japanese hit \"You Wish You Had Someone to Love\" (Sakurako no Aoi wa Oishii Imo ka?). The songs \"She's So Beautiful\", \"It's Too Late\", and \"August\", were all taken from her albums, Heartbreak Hotel, and Centipede,, respectively. Heartbreak Hotel received a mixed critical response due in part to some of the less commercially successful songs being featured, like \"Little Girl Blue\", \"The Bells\", and \"Do You Want Me to Hold You Down?\".","token_len":437,"entropy":[6.6744,0.2906,6.8377,0.7242,8.1123,2.3828,7.2143,0.7782,9.6583,1.4602,0.0335,1.7745,8.3792,1.7182,4.2145,5.4362,1.7225,6.5161,0.9226,1.7332,4.3949,2.1647,3.6471,4.3622,3.4795,0.7744,2.7015,0.2175,6.5132,0.6495,4.0348,0.2722,1.7928,1.0336,1.4092,5.7351,7.6509,0.4696,4.7492,3.6466,4.4267,1.3199,4.38,0.1972,0.4127,4.2723,1.9869,2.6315,0.9162,4.7581,0.9443,1.7466,4.962,0.3028,0.2936,2.1486,0.0042,0.0002,0.0009,0.9154,2.6408,1.6853,0.0,4.6135,2.69,3.517,1.8028,0.8616,3.5265,2.1617,0.0144,3.6437,1.0613,3.564,0.0019,1.7383,7.3844,4.5239,0.0098,1.0147,10.4752,5.5525,2.1882,0.9248,2.6307,3.8694,8.2928,2.6535,4.8253,5.7766,3.5547,0.2366,1.411,0.3156,2.2058,4.4061,1.566,0.2551,2.2741,1.8054,13.1104,3.2241,5.0857,3.991,0.1693,2.8127,1.908,12.2677,5.5255,0.2525,3.9247,3.2927,1.7318,0.9854,2.3356,0.8459,4.5549,0.2505,2.6525,1.8676,1.3307,2.1735,9.9631,1.8728,0.6658,9.7306,0.1064,0.156,0.2421,0.5003,1.9765,3.2094,1.4824,4.0607,1.4595,2.0572,2.2068,4.5934,12.593,0.3533,8.1034,1.6496,6.0771,0.0512,3.1158,2.6867,0.6309,1.6642,0.7183,4.9952,5.4216,3.8201,0.0425,1.0999,4.004,0.1435,0.3011,6.5962,2.6696,1.1493,2.1478,1.5962,2.4139,0.8949,3.5776,3.6234,1.1108,1.618,1.1034,5.204,0.687,1.9836,1.4681,1.5574,3.3244,1.6422,5.3598,7.7057,0.0103,4.2038,8.5454,2.3495,2.0666,0.4304,7.1095,1.4651,0.3836,5.613,0.9632,0.0002,0.2704,8.465,0.0232,0.0298,0.2485,4.1861,8.0566,0.0326,0.0008,0.2617,3.1756,2.9032,0.2206,5.5767,4.0739,1.6034,5.0954,0.3247,0.0,0.3502,5.48,1.0389,0.8329,0.1249,1.3442,2.0668,0.3782,0.0482,0.0001,0.0107,0.1323,0.0185,0.5382,1.3199,2.1916,2.8803,3.0675,2.6639,1.3193,3.6677,5.2268,3.1399,2.0855,4.5663,1.8624,2.3002,3.867,2.2049,1.3304,4.5946,0.6768,7.7503,2.2267,7.0876,0.5864,4.9041,5.3334,0.0467,0.0583,0.8171,0.5523,2.3013,3.6994,6.8174,1.1119,4.3341,6.5592,2.0009,8.7226,1.0098,4.9664,5.7213,3.1744,0.5479,2.2334,0.0415,5.4417,1.3172,2.7461,3.0834,6.0268,4.1597,1.84,2.2318,4.1215,0.1248,4.1064,5.0189,2.7789,3.099,0.9274,4.3436,0.737,1.999,5.6403,6.4756,0.942,2.5112,0.1861,1.5102,1.9724,3.5939,0.2922,3.7095,5.8462,2.7007,2.3546,0.5315,1.6968,2.6541,0.2774,5.2056,0.8815,4.964,0.4271,1.1595,5.9615,5.6316,2.7542,1.1631,0.4311,1.1131,2.9662,1.775,3.9786,0.4651,8.1486,2.2866,2.5482,4.1691,1.566,1.685,7.4148,2.8671,4.97,4.8105,2.4687,0.1205,1.5808,4.2031,3.6963,0.6438,4.4113,6.7066,0.6746,3.7625,6.2071,2.0733,1.4264,1.5156,2.5301,5.7409,2.6593,2.9998,3.74,2.4703,4.8949,3.2151,4.4899,5.2782,5.152,3.9878,8.1439,4.1861,6.2594,2.1259,2.2829,5.2576,3.3626,6.0531,1.2321,3.2938,1.9919,1.9704,0.1095,4.3103,0.3099,3.8348,0.6707,1.4909,1.2371,0.0703,9.8205,3.5891,2.0834,3.8608,5.2513,0.6947,1.7662,5.1885,1.7804,7.0172,0.0736,0.0215,1.8446,1.2384,9.0045,0.0015,0.0001,9.1307,3.9068,0.246,5.914,0.0146,0.009,3.7972,2.2018,3.3268,2.3556,1.7641,4.6593,4.303,0.3739,0.0024,5.7051,1.2239,0.4939,5.3337,6.9074,0.3702,1.579,3.4839,4.189,2.8317,3.884,0.4249,6.8103,2.8863,6.7169,0.9341,1.0765,3.4602,6.8263,1.3034,1.0397,0.5545,0.215,6.0951,1.0855,1.8757,2.0309,1.7555,5.2721,1.6751,2.7657,1.8269]}

In 2003, Irish singer @ - @ songwriter Mickey Joe Harte recorded an acoustic rendition of `` Crazy In Love `` for his album Music for Lovers. As part of the album, he also recorded a cover of the song. John Hiatt recorded a version entitled `` Crazy For Loving You '' on his album Dandelion Fields, while Steve Earle recorded a version entitled `` Crazy When I Love You '' as part of his Christmas album of the same title, released in December 1991. Ringo Starr, another Beatles, recorded a version entitled `` Crazy in Love '' for his 1967 album All Things Must Pass. He covered the song in the same year on A Screaming Heart, and in 1997 on On the Rainbow.\nThe track was included on the live album, B-Sides, in 2001. In 2003, a song entitled `` Crazy in Love (Gotta Be Somebody)`` was recorded by a group from California, The Wigwams. This cover was featured in a 1999 episode, The Twilight Zone Music Show. A cover of the song was recorded by the group The Screaming Weasel Band in 1993. The band recorded a video of the song in the same year.\nAll the versions of the song performed by artists other than the Beatles were recorded for the soundtrack album soundtrack of The Love Bug, based on the film of the same name. The song was recorded between 1970 and 1971 by groups such as The Yardbirds, Cream, The Stray Cats, The Crickets, The Byrds, The Monkees and, more recently, Red Hot Chili Peppers.\nIn 1997, the song was featured in the film The Little Shop of Horrors, as well as by the title character. In 2006, songwriter James Poyser, who wrote the song for the movie The Little Shop of Horrors, adapted the song, and called it `` The Little Shop Rock '' based on his reaction to the song's success.\nAlso in 2006, the song was also used in the trailer of the romantic comedy film The Big Year, as featured song of the year.","token_len":437,"entropy":[9.4336,1.89,7.1433,8.2445,1.2056,0.1636,11.1406,13.8666,4.3051,1.5598,2.9818,4.2286,3.5071,4.5468,0.2298,10.1131,1.8944,10.3972,9.0361,4.9326,8.8723,0.9405,9.0757,7.5173,6.5785,7.7534,2.602,2.4666,2.6312,3.761,0.0687,1.1072,2.056,2.8494,0.0309,2.2424,3.4134,1.9998,2.1678,7.9069,1.7898,6.4552,0.0772,0.6657,5.6917,3.0823,0.0007,1.0331,2.1034,0.6428,2.4178,2.4321,1.7179,1.1388,1.972,1.2665,2.131,1.3051,3.174,5.8037,7.4325,0.2907,2.9447,1.378,2.4991,6.0641,0.2835,2.9743,7.1261,7.2732,2.465,2.9437,2.8712,1.2424,2.4099,6.3385,5.1564,0.1927,6.3885,2.4526,4.8702,5.1984,5.038,0.1017,0.6952,0.865,1.4939,1.1297,0.1537,2.0414,6.4885,1.4401,2.7072,0.1311,1.4766,4.6693,0.8038,0.0005,0.4497,6.498,0.8241,4.8603,1.9873,0.0426,2.2851,3.5019,3.8475,0.4191,3.8482,4.9001,0.1009,7.4419,0.1045,0.0605,2.9304,5.007,3.7486,4.9561,0.9269,0.8562,1.6984,1.2955,0.1343,1.5588,3.0648,0.1926,2.2663,0.9411,0.1423,5.8047,0.6453,5.3359,5.3189,1.3074,0.1274,0.8891,4.022,6.7317,0.8771,0.9001,1.7721,2.38,2.6965,4.5205,3.7214,7.0545,10.689,0.7673,3.9071,1.4057,1.9662,1.9442,4.3183,2.6887,7.4545,1.41,6.5737,3.1399,2.7213,5.3442,5.8515,2.2456,4.0648,0.8163,1.1319,7.1114,1.0968,2.6233,6.7561,3.7551,4.1317,0.0816,1.4989,2.6199,3.6618,0.5442,2.2331,2.0402,0.1407,3.481,3.2842,1.1191,0.1751,1.9822,1.1783,0.0946,3.5878,5.6174,3.0123,2.5678,2.0492,1.1884,5.1072,0.2323,1.4699,1.9591,4.6748,2.4043,4.7659,4.0958,2.6742,5.0389,6.5161,5.1905,1.452,1.9748,0.6785,3.6104,4.7114,1.7064,3.1426,1.6823,1.9234,4.7646,3.1823,5.3295,2.9367,7.1272,0.0594,8.014,3.1929,0.8128,3.8769,2.1732,0.6166,0.9315,0.2856,0.5771,2.2743,1.3528,2.5653,2.4098,4.3004,7.4046,0.456,7.5789,1.7056,4.9288,1.7857,4.3676,0.4339,1.8481,2.6084,2.3477,1.0595,5.4124,2.5072,0.6128,0.8742,1.9144,2.8073,3.9136,0.5955,1.9017,1.7107,5.6586,3.0167,4.7276,0.4468,1.189,0.4057,6.119,0.7999,6.496,4.4383,0.0032,2.5148,0.6743,1.2982,1.5682,2.2835,1.1223,4.9517,3.114,8.303,2.6326,2.4671,6.992,4.5366,1.6981,5.1134,0.0591,0.715,4.4528,2.6735,0.3179,0.0057,0.245,0.7267,1.2453,2.3497,0.5469,2.1412,6.6582,5.4927,0.0858,3.0933,2.1165,8.9512,1.7257,0.0037,1.3806,6.7861,0.0235,0.4786,7.9351,1.2958,2.0175,5.0625,5.0249,0.8403,0.3048,1.6098,6.5701,1.1125,0.3757,1.3539,5.3102,0.0006,0.2522,1.1015,5.9175,0.0316,1.7419,4.9955,3.9297,0.041,0.0493,6.4874,0.2836,0.0164,0.0004,0.0002,0.218,1.594,2.4773,3.9514,0.1501,1.6478,2.5229,0.3866,2.0669,0.9962,1.1322,3.7251,2.43,5.5371,4.1543,0.0865,0.0006,0.0047,0.8263,3.9626,1.5631,0.0202,5.5811,1.7188,5.1041,4.0597,2.4423,1.8058,3.835,0.098,6.3198,0.2772,4.347,4.8225,7.8212,4.8513,3.5761,1.1096,2.9162,0.5795,1.4888,1.5062,1.0292,1.9169,2.9863,3.222,0.2988,0.1716,0.0086,0.0,0.1561,7.4787,1.0141,0.8226,4.3319,1.4746,5.6103,0.35,0.8138,2.8704,1.7603,0.3379,8.31,4.2307,6.1059,0.0331,3.3149,5.4814,0.2139,0.5828,1.1464,2.1059,4.41,0.5196,1.5744,5.751,0.892,2.7082,0.0513,1.3036,0.6131,0.2117,4.3132,3.2821,0.7989,1.021,5.9573,3.7568,1.0206,8.2914,0.2967,3.678,2.1585,3.7277,9.5326,1.2145,3.3015,4.2457,8.789,3.0535,0.3825,4.7016,1.4635]}

Originally the system was expected to reach","text":"An area of disturbed weather south of Acapulco organized into Tropical Depression Six @ - @ E on June 29 and the system began to move northwest. Originally the system was expected to reach the California coast somewhere on Monday. But by Monday it had dissipated. There was an additional low pressure system east of the system. It made a secondary impact and another system formed northwest of the primary system, but it did not move north. This system just moved west and dissipated around mid-lunation (MJ) on Sunday.\nSome models were not able to capture the secondary impacts, but they were not doing great on the primary system either. Models gave a little bit wider range on wind speeds, but the main impact was that it was moving slower as you might expect and we are still in the dry phase of the monsoon.\nIt is not going to be a perfect monsoon this year. Even though June 29 is predicted for a peak monsoon, it could be better than normal and we could see a little more rain. But given what has been going on, it will likely not be as good as the monsoon of 2000 or 2001.\nAs monsoon has moved through the months, and it has been getting closer to Acapulco, the main rain has been on the east side of the city at the Sierra Madre mountain range. About half way between the coast and Acapulco, there has been more rain. But the main rain has been farther to the north, at the base of the Sierra Madre mountain range.\nThe amount of rain has been far less than normal. The main rain period for Acapulco was from December 2009 - March 2010. That year we got the largest rain volume in Acapulco\u2019s 60 years of rain data.\nThere has been little rain in the past half a dozen years and we\u2019re going to see that trend to continue. The rainy period for 2010 \u2013 2016 were at or below the normal. What is important to know is that we see this trend not only in Acapulco, but throughout the state. That trend appears to be continuing.","token_len":438,"entropy":[7.5649,1.2954,10.8744,5.9627,7.118,0.0619,8.4715,2.552,0.0016,0.0019,11.4223,4.9445,7.3192,4.3068,10.9025,10.7881,6.9825,5.7234,6.1171,7.384,4.0668,3.7077,4.8201,4.0655,7.1044,4.1316,0.4393,3.7787,4.2161,2.4501,9.1172,2.7882,2.4914,0.5524,2.717,0.0152,3.2465,2.0086,5.5607,0.6715,8.4843,4.3875,5.6504,1.8719,3.4696,4.1502,2.828,3.2381,1.9585,7.7455,0.0016,1.7236,4.8993,1.1482,3.2614,4.3633,6.0289,1.9747,1.5074,4.6163,0.1043,1.8798,3.8942,1.7076,3.0691,5.7069,2.4779,7.8753,2.1538,3.5523,6.5434,3.2603,5.0951,4.5294,0.2653,0.4049,6.7651,3.3468,2.9128,2.6188,1.9348,2.24,0.0613,3.1195,2.2089,1.0531,3.3642,2.2674,8.3712,2.7358,2.1895,2.6706,7.3137,0.0013,5.1467,4.3647,0.2881,8.6359,2.2524,5.1965,4.6939,11.1014,2.2522,1.4553,3.5735,0.7092,2.0061,7.316,6.5946,4.4589,4.0716,1.9103,0.0036,4.7941,0.6995,5.2271,2.1627,2.3063,0.964,1.9352,1.654,3.8407,6.7007,4.6161,3.8982,1.585,4.253,1.3274,5.5855,0.2256,6.6194,6.8849,1.7914,4.9501,1.6555,8.8784,2.7326,3.646,7.2135,1.8459,1.6703,0.5221,2.1872,3.3898,2.4442,0.836,3.9499,2.4451,1.2475,2.5987,5.9192,5.125,4.9591,5.2857,0.1227,4.2035,5.3163,3.5949,1.8972,3.3767,0.7551,7.2419,3.936,1.1765,0.4137,7.2855,0.0593,1.3296,1.3152,4.0517,1.4926,2.7567,5.837,0.1757,0.7596,1.5166,4.2266,5.6861,0.003,4.4461,0.6547,1.2942,5.1398,1.8855,7.966,2.4539,1.2822,5.7341,4.8507,1.4799,5.486,3.1326,0.0032,0.8123,1.6056,2.9836,1.245,5.1531,1.2691,2.7624,3.2534,2.5317,2.0722,0.8401,1.8897,3.742,1.4166,1.7181,2.1632,3.1297,6.0519,3.9295,3.0735,1.4476,1.4786,0.0307,1.8155,1.4833,2.6038,3.3158,2.8409,0.4637,2.2946,2.086,0.5799,2.3713,2.0789,0.0558,2.9509,5.4359,1.9871,2.3559,0.4566,0.8651,4.3061,7.824,0.1445,5.1518,2.4792,3.4562,0.746,7.6359,0.9298,4.4185,3.0718,1.495,2.0198,2.9439,3.5287,0.7005,10.1389,0.0085,0.0076,0.0003,0.5093,1.8148,3.96,5.989,4.7264,1.2508,3.8754,0.9928,2.5392,0.8318,0.411,0.2642,5.7441,5.0923,2.2864,7.9561,1.6955,0.0292,5.7823,0.3166,0.55,6.4809,2.803,3.7631,2.7164,1.2421,6.0161,0.4309,3.1301,0.0014,0.0036,0.0007,0.8892,2.5002,2.7512,0.0581,3.3341,0.8031,2.0294,3.4182,1.9039,2.2721,1.9069,1.5358,0.7114,7.7045,3.4,0.0946,1.7042,1.6611,3.8692,0.9667,4.2427,0.0411,0.5883,1.1231,0.137,0.0024,1.6303,0.0222,0.6079,1.4879,1.8192,6.1963,0.0449,0.6641,1.6455,0.9448,5.9047,2.2627,1.0923,2.3331,1.5262,1.7625,2.3205,0.8786,7.4453,3.5296,6.7297,0.0005,0.005,0.0007,2.0203,3.9224,4.4602,6.2425,4.4399,2.5424,1.0563,0.7394,2.9314,4.2883,3.865,3.3027,3.9241,3.1375,1.8797,5.8731,1.5612,4.4236,0.0004,0.0055,0.0016,13.6335,6.2214,5.2821,7.7863,3.6273,2.4247,2.2732,6.3645,0.7956,1.5954,3.1928,1.6095,0.1072,3.6459,0.7986,1.2074,0.9623,3.8378,5.4803,2.7624,3.5842,0.524,3.0995,2.4156,14.4196,2.9817,2.4817,3.3785,0.1283,0.8959,3.8236,4.4469,5.5323,1.27,0.7975,2.2424,5.1615,5.0066,2.3847,6.8686,6.7072,5.573,5.317,5.1798,4.3735,2.1474,2.0282,2.6617,3.7876,5.9311,1.6983,3.8276,1.4626,3.5368,0.4535,0.208,2.6144,5.5114,3.5574,2.8131,3.6471,1.197,1.1572,2.0664,0.0005,0.0092,0.0013,0.8076,0.0646,3.4054,0.5532,2.426,0.9837,4.172,4.3239,5.6243,0.1156,0.4287,2.7571,1.3287]}

The wall is now a parkland estate called Llandrindod Wells Park. The walls are still occasionally used for ceremonial purposes including a Royal procession on 25 June, called 'The Llandrindod Show', which features the queen and royal family.\nThe oldest stone in Llandrindod is a cairn thought to date from the Iron Age.\nThe medieval church, St. Mary's Church, is a Grade II listed building, built in several stages between the 11th and 16th centuries, with some additions made in the 18th century. The church has a plain, Gothic tower.\nIn 1554 the monks of Bethlehem Abbey built a priory church at Llandrindod, under a charter granted by Henry VIII. This became the basis for an abbey and a priory and was one of many priory churches in Wales. The priory was dissolved and demolished by Henry VIII in 1546.\n\nMilitary\n\nFrom 1840 the town became a strategic location. It has been occupied by German troops since 1940, in the course of World War II. During June and July 1942, a second Allied invasion of the area was planned as Operation Springboard, with landings in Wales taking place between Aberystwyth and Llandrindod and on the British Isles between Swansea and Carlisle.\nPlans for Operation Springboard included a two-pronged invasion by troops from West Germany, Czechoslovakia and Greece. During the campaign, which was the most dramatic action on the western front in World War II, a major number of German troops were lost, with only around 3,000 troops arriving alive in Britain. The invasion took place on 4\u20136 June 1944. The Luftwaffe made a series of attacks on Llandrindod in July 1942 before preparing for the invasion.\nAfter the war, the town was used for training exercises in the 1960s and 1970s.","token_len":438,"entropy":[8.7203,8.7694,6.3797,5.7063,4.8147,4.0607,10.3397,3.1438,0.9099,4.2209,0.2774,0.1926,1.0194,4.5736,3.5472,4.5182,4.5585,2.382,2.6775,9.2778,4.9605,0.9348,1.3158,2.6602,0.5702,9.2406,0.1942,0.3548,4.8489,1.9647,3.7596,3.143,7.8157,5.014,4.8613,6.0135,2.862,4.098,0.6625,1.3687,0.3336,1.9813,2.6209,3.3753,1.532,2.2382,5.0784,5.2279,10.0649,5.9477,5.4313,6.1094,4.1091,3.3586,8.4409,8.5285,4.6704,0.868,2.2321,4.2915,1.6794,3.2938,7.4937,1.1403,1.3743,4.7948,0.3207,4.8999,3.0672,6.9573,4.6757,3.659,6.4258,2.2996,2.4025,7.5412,2.5838,1.5642,3.7226,0.1819,0.1336,0.0078,0.3077,6.1176,1.4421,1.2986,4.3992,2.4395,7.8765,1.2181,6.211,1.0696,1.3035,0.9945,8.4434,6.8199,4.3734,4.4093,2.8382,0.0073,0.0291,0.0005,0.013,2.8568,2.3147,5.707,2.1834,0.0639,8.6186,0.0764,2.415,1.0435,0.954,7.9704,0.0223,1.216,2.8869,1.5862,6.3018,4.1938,3.2625,4.6372,2.6652,2.7579,0.9464,1.7519,0.777,1.5999,2.6627,7.9674,1.1286,4.8708,1.3231,2.4989,2.5806,0.4921,10.2331,3.7757,2.3104,1.964,2.8854,0.0976,0.2389,2.7274,0.0553,0.2988,2.2057,2.4236,4.3381,4.4591,3.4601,1.6178,0.4131,2.6104,0.0174,0.5478,0.3578,1.7002,1.2399,2.6362,1.8899,8.1602,2.8538,6.4539,6.8603,3.3846,1.0378,3.1288,3.4266,4.3058,2.2571,6.382,1.2752,8.3285,3.5703,1.193,0.5758,9.0486,0.034,4.8875,2.5369,2.2127,0.0755,0.0318,0.0023,0.0372,2.0966,5.2457,2.5478,8.4658,2.3434,0.5839,4.2986,1.0868,1.0717,2.761,4.6672,1.3081,5.8019,0.3444,3.7039,5.8697,0.0209,3.0708,2.2214,6.1786,0.0035,4.3409,3.2529,4.3804,0.0127,4.0344,5.1271,0.4496,0.9177,1.7958,5.6214,0.8102,1.6837,2.4934,0.0056,1.3171,9.0396,3.6025,5.361,2.8753,1.5716,0.381,0.369,1.1354,5.7727,0.6628,0.9781,8.5924,8.8157,5.2816,0.0006,5.3671,7.2944,2.7982,3.1847,2.8887,0.8808,5.7376,2.522,4.4451,2.2196,3.9366,1.3877,4.5602,0.6041,5.8301,1.5444,0.8156,4.15,1.3846,4.6597,1.4562,4.2188,0.0037,4.4318,0.0029,0.3112,0.4044,3.1438,8.8151,1.5052,0.5723,2.7103,0.9531,3.1614,6.4843,5.3809,1.6668,1.03,1.187,3.071,1.6018,4.3679,4.3156,6.4062,7.7975,6.2091,1.3503,2.9856,6.0615,2.0175,1.5612,5.8128,6.0363,0.0205,3.229,7.8428,2.3356,0.0023,0.0,0.0001,0.2245,2.9303,0.046,0.0491,0.0019,0.0606,3.7769,3.8101,1.4591,4.9378,2.6649,4.1732,7.2201,0.0797,6.36,0.2418,0.2416,0.9505,22.0031,1.1805,0.7444,4.0377,0.3478,0.0035,2.5845,1.8766,5.0885,0.3871,3.9675,0.0004,0.0313,2.2174,3.4411,5.3479,0.7075,6.3668,1.1468,1.2905,6.5959,0.0282,0.0026,0.7055,6.175,1.1889,3.7297,0.8604,3.5428,0.7937,4.9823,1.9288,4.1501,2.6131,5.4264,5.3797,3.2908,0.7618,5.1676,0.2069,2.2272,1.5059,0.0009,0.2844,0.0818,3.2297,4.4267,4.596,0.0048,1.6213,1.1307,1.2209,3.7799,1.8476,2.7004,3.6744,4.7898,3.7802,0.0522,0.3975,3.7548,5.6175,6.1934,3.1315,2.6922,0.6333,2.1023,2.9942,4.2701,0.158,1.5194,4.9036,9.6544,1.7033,1.4094,1.6078,1.132,2.1657,7.3302,0.0021,0.0027,0.0002,4.6336,1.3597,2.9943,0.0011,3.0524,0.664,1.2653,0.0052,0.0032,0.0007,0.006,2.0835,3.9704,3.6228,5.5676,9.0244,0.9408,1.0512,0.8617,0.9155,1.1897,18.0938,0.6081,1.83,0.4687,1.1873,0.4596,1.0076,3.3633,1.7772,3.6595,3.0136,2.7316,1.3127,4.8262,0.0249,1.1426,0.9097,0.0005,0.6834]}
{"prompt":"Discarding one 's corrective lenses , as Bates recommended , or wearing lenses weaker than one 's prescribed correction , as some Bates method advocates suggest , poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations","text":"Discarding one's corrective lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses weaker than one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations.The author has seen such safety hazards arise.\nThe Bates method, as it works, should not be taken lightly.To determine the degree of lens wear to use is complex science, but may be done using instruments designed by Bates with a degree of accuracy.\nAs Bates explains, there is no \" one-fits-all, \" because every human face is different.\nWhat appears to Bates to be a minor change could possibly make a very significant difference to how the eyes are aligned in front of the head.\nBates developed his formula after considering a lot of very different factors.\nHe is not the first to consider this aspect of vision correction, but he is the first to write about the specific consequences of one-fits-all lens recommendations.\nA recent British study of over 30,000 older people concluded that the best approach to improving a poor eye sight is to advise each individual to wear a pair of the most suitable single vision loupes to help him or her see.If a pair of loupes can be worn without difficulty, then that person is advised to continue with that pair.If the loupes are too large for the individual, then a lens of suitable correction is placed on the loupe with a second loupe that is the same size as the primary loupe in front.\nIn other cases, one lens of suitable correction is fitted directly in front of the eye by a physician.In other situations, a pair of loupes which is larger than the individual's desired degree of correction is used.\nThe most recent American study of this nature is currently being prepared by the Department of Health, Services and Human Resources at the University of Colorado.It is hoped that this study along with the other current work will demonstrate which of the two approaches is

{"prompt":"Several interconnected themes run through Szab\u00f3 \u2019 s films , the most common being the relationship between the personal and the political or historical . On the personal level , his first three feature films","text":"Several interconnected themes run through Szab\u00f3 \u2019 s films, the most common being the relationship between the personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films focus on the lives of individuals striving to achieve their fullest potential, but also on the dangers of such an endeavor, in the midst of a society that often seeks to marginalize people on the basis of their religious or social background.\nAlthough most of Szab\u00f3\u2019s films are set in Hungary, his stories take international themes and issues while still featuring characters familiar to Hungarian audiences. The most recent of his films, the acclaimed adaptation of The Mistress, has been screened as part of the Official Selection of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, but has been banned by local owners of a Hungarian chain of supermarket stores because the characters use alcohol, smoke tobacco, and have sex. This is a clear attempt to censor the film, which contains explicit scenes of sex. The Mistress was previously shown as part of a competition of newcomer films at Cannes in 2012.\nIn Szab\u00f3\u2019s films, religious issues frequently come up, both in the personal lives of his characters and in the political conflicts between the main protagonists and their political and religious opponents. The most prominent example of Szab\u00f3\u2019s interest in religious issues is his film, which deals with the Hungarian revolution of 1956 and its aftermath, as observed by a Catholic priest, an evangelist, and two Jewish communists.\nAnother feature of Szab\u00f3 \u2019 s films concerns sexuality, which often plays an important part in the content of his films. In his films, sexuality has a different meaning than it does in Western culture. In his films, sexuality is not only understood as physical procreation but also as psychological connection and a feeling of being accepted. In his debut feature film, Szab\u00f3 gives the lead part to a homosexual character, who falls in love with a woman in a way that is completely atypical of what is considered typical male \/ female relations. In a different feature film, which was published in 2012, Szab\u00f3 presents a lesbian couple having to deal with problems brought about by their attraction to one another.","token_len":440,"entropy":[11.6754,7.7701,6.3533,0.5451,12.428,3.9469,0.7282,12.6381,7.4253,7.3831,9.5127,1.4215,3.2753,4.4854,3.4089,0.9188,1.1954,4.6712,0.0915,1.4533,7.6931,0.4911,0.4519,2.3464,6.3033,5.2314,1.2629,5.0917,0.7722,3.8046,1.0959,0.2282,6.3209,5.6709,5.6867,5.4805,0.2465,6.12,0.2164,1.0998,4.5092,0.1497,4.8847,6.6934,0.5871,2.5844,1.5837,5.5007,0.2832,1.7511,3.0023,1.518,0.913,0.6607,8.3056,0.9577,5.5616,3.4006,2.8609,2.0181,3.9182,1.9923,4.2203,0.0011,1.5696,4.3541,1.539,4.2935,4.3262,0.2661,4.9888,0.0311,3.6385,4.7107,0.3157,0.1133,0.01,0.5353,4.9387,1.525,2.8004,2.2451,0.2535,2.2694,11.8443,4.4183,0.4248,0.9223,0.0126,0.003,5.924,0.0694,3.2374,0.5898,1.204,4.3435,0.3909,4.2185,0.3561,2.4916,4.3095,3.5255,9.6262,4.1579,1.8037,7.1879,8.2598,3.4043,6.4584,5.2129,6.0588,0.6444,3.8148,1.6652,0.6259,2.3224,2.8877,2.9581,1.9568,1.5849,0.6764,0.9496,3.0715,5.2457,4.9944,0.1171,3.8709,11.5723,2.0063,3.5509,1.3353,2.8541,5.331,1.4577,0.0009,0.7368,7.8189,5.6441,1.7083,1.4652,5.4101,3.62,0.103,0.06,1.6431,4.2291,3.2588,1.8601,4.1454,1.4751,5.1814,8.9121,1.8538,4.7642,2.5828,5.1974,0.9,6.371,2.6988,3.1955,2.8694,5.5693,6.3938,6.6202,2.7256,6.9294,4.1129,0.7159,0.3773,3.0047,3.4732,1.2684,4.1327,2.238,2.3239,4.6439,3.2298,0.5368,6.8661,1.4611,1.4085,1.4629,1.906,5.6562,3.7921,2.5241,0.9608,2.5299,2.8623,2.3422,5.8814,2.7681,5.9704,2.5771,2.31,1.5704,0.0005,1.598,5.6008,4.0763,12.7949,1.6816,2.6488,1.3612,2.4969,2.8037,1.3226,0.9026,2.7506,2.4748,0.0066,0.0013,0.81,0.0008,0.2076,1.4894,0.15,6.1218,4.508,5.4471,2.7316,0.5825,1.2289,4.5403,1.0921,1.2228,2.9272,6.2367,0.1328,3.8681,1.0017,0.26,0.6651,0.8693,2.386,5.6154,3.199,1.4237,5.0785,2.0013,3.0815,1.3327,1.8659,3.4165,1.461,1.5075,0.1059,2.1249,2.3327,2.1524,1.5626,0.5816,3.9249,0.0026,0.0008,0.1754,0.0012,0.0689,7.2956,0.2605,1.4159,0.3971,0.8999,1.7773,4.5991,1.7044,3.9268,4.0016,0.1406,0.8134,6.2482,6.7538,1.958,2.638,2.7668,1.7681,0.9426,1.5805,3.3521,7.7699,0.7995,3.5339,6.266,0.8147,1.9929,5.5667,8.0874,0.0184,0.3084,0.3909,4.2743,4.2883,7.0516,0.7017,1.8878,5.3359,4.7155,1.9461,0.1333,0.0031,0.0009,4.2261,0.0027,0.3914,0.3164,6.0498,8.6038,1.2671,2.0266,3.8025,4.0286,2.071,0.2773,1.9584,0.0612,1.245,7.6681,0.2523,0.6503,0.3116,0.3235,1.7591,1.5551,1.9702,0.1647,3.6694,4.095,1.7405,6.1261,1.1726,1.904,2.9517,0.5011,0.1341,5.9672,3.6407,1.0377,1.812,1.3663,1.1432,0.2201,1.8845,0.568,3.0332,2.8507,4.9188,1.2893,6.1478,10.7011,0.1853,1.5706,0.418,0.6853,4.9099,6.9683,2.8464,2.8047,5.7568,0.2646,3.1023,5.2252,1.9999,1.6983,0.874,9.3838,1.4269,0.9865,0.2381,3.3355,0.019,0.0012,7.2573,1.9795,6.4124,6.1445,0.617,1.0418,3.7648,2.8415,0.9955,2.2182,5.945,0.2883,0.0153,0.0647,0.7972,2.3377,2.9361,1.2506,6.481,0.5199,1.5775,3.862,5.8616,4.16,0.0098,0.7241,3.3753,1.8696,4.3773,4.0709,7.1563,10.0522,0.5349,4.1381,0.6709,1.9305,3.0135,4.1333,4.4849,1.0275,0.2453,3.8184,2.364,5.0503,0.4871,2.9467,0.2406,1.5327,0.0048,0.0016,5.6774,1.0394,2.5418,1.713,5.9387,5.5819,2.1534,0.0018,5.3305,6.3666,1.9801,0.0909,1.5479,5.176,0.3053,1.5192,0.027,0.8937]}

He trained in Washington D.C. at the Marine Corps Training Center and was commissioned on August 13, 1898 with an appointment as adjutant general.\n\n1898\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1898, he was the company commander of the 1st Marine Regiment, commanded by Brigadier General Edward T. Wilson, in the assault on Manila. Before the first shot was fired by the Marines the Americans were given a clear line of sight in the front of the fortifications that surrounded the city. Butler had been asked to move the Marine artillery to the right flank of the Marines.\nWhen the assault began the Marines were under intense fire and the Americans were firing mortars from the top of the building. After killing several of the enemy, the Marines began to push up to the top of the buildings. During the assault Butler was shot twice, and his own two men became casualties while trying to extricate them himself. After the assault the Marines suffered no casualties.\nThe second assault by the American troops on  the town of Manila began on a Sunday. They set off in hundreds of vehicles headed for Manila Bay. Before reaching Manila Bay the Marines encountered some Japanese troops and in a fierce fight with the Japanese they killed 18 Japanese and were wounded by two more. On their way back to base the Marines were accompanied on the road by an artillery battery. This artillery battery included some heavy machine guns. At one point during the ride the three machine guns of the artillery battery opened fire at the retreating Marines.\nAfter returning to the United States, Butler was hospitalized suffering from stomach ailments and pneumonia. He reported to duty as the adjutant general of the Marine Corps in Washington, D.C. in March, 1899.

The film has grossed over \u20b913 crore (US$ 2.7 million).\n\nRelease\n\nRam Kapoor has been a very well known Hindi auteur and director. His previous movies have been box office hits, and he has been receiving positive reviews. Many critics are positive too but are divided in their verdict since his previous film, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" was criticized. \"Amr Raat\" is supposedly his most romantic film so far. Many Bollywood lovers are disappointed with the romance movie being compared to his previous films, mainly because they are criticizing Rani Mukherji.\nThe film ran for the month of June 2008 in the United States, and was released in Italy on July 11, 2008. The film received positive reviews in India and abroad, including in Italy, where it won the Best Film award at the RomeFilmFest and is currently running in Italy's CineFestival.

The remaining three torpedo boats of the 2nd and 6th Damen Squadron were the torpedo boats Trento, and the torpedo boats Trento-Brignole ( SSD-234, SSD-237 ), of the 1st Damen Squadron, as well as the torpedo boat Carpeneta ( SSD-235 ) of the 6th Damen Squadron.","token_len":443,"entropy":[7.4286,4.2246,10.9045,1.4532,0.0002,7.4252,5.5718,2.3836,1.7857,4.0932,3.3009,7.8343,1.3006,3.7053,10.1176,6.7527,0.9277,5.7084,6.4215,9.7655,5.0578,14.7643,2.7513,1.179,4.7656,1.5613,6.3417,2.1403,0.8888,5.7149,5.3633,2.2368,2.3178,7.2136,0.5734,6.9523,0.0121,0.0004,0.1665,0.002,0.0022,0.0013,4.1404,11.0397,2.5092,3.1249,8.5819,6.0386,1.0375,3.1024,8.5585,1.2607,0.6165,0.0086,1.0672,1.589,5.9677,2.7683,1.1222,0.5193,1.4588,1.3562,1.879,1.8781,0.693,10.1849,2.2035,0.8522,5.8306,2.2069,1.008,16.9223,2.3365,2.5427,6.5709,0.7585,0.7671,5.0664,3.3234,1.3315,5.9561,1.4462,1.3833,2.7941,2.1147,1.8966,6.9913,2.7655,7.2477,0.8734,5.3481,6.3312,7.2578,1.6172,4.9125,1.5212,3.0383,0.0656,0.1397,5.0181,0.7072,3.3999,7.8649,1.5497,2.2927,11.8207,0.0029,0.7935,2.3524,4.8029,6.0337,9.3714,4.0293,3.5392,4.9,1.4041,2.6197,0.9087,4.0953,5.3788,0.3057,9.8136,5.2959,5.1353,1.619,3.9033,0.0452,2.7234,4.68,0.6535,3.2016,5.8858,0.3896,2.6388,1.9945,8.9779,0.0641,0.3689,4.2806,3.2015,1.9576,3.4978,0.8075,4.2204,2.5618,2.7851,3.4882,2.4594,1.9893,5.2898,0.5169,0.2549,1.4126,3.5798,2.8248,4.2145,4.0268,0.1722,2.9503,0.0898,2.2211,5.1149,2.5372,0.1007,0.5922,0.738,5.387,1.2054,0.9221,1.7819,0.1335,9.0125,1.1221,3.9711,7.6211,0.0011,0.8395,2.8687,1.2791,3.0373,1.1024,0.0101,1.3105,3.3481,3.6515,4.4561,0.0995,2.4051,0.1071,2.6392,0.3867,0.0406,0.0079,8.0652,0.981,3.0129,2.211,4.9068,3.3028,1.8651,0.8406,5.8579,1.6753,0.4902,8.3087,6.8391,0.0028,0.192,1.3476,0.0832,2.4618,1.414,2.6377,0.8483,5.1837,0.6576,5.1107,0.5106,5.0943,4.0303,2.0493,5.8118,3.3679,8.262,2.9664,1.0085,2.1717,4.0791,4.6591,0.4469,1.6361,1.0519,7.2961,4.1879,5.8101,5.7055,7.0909,5.5166,2.8769,16.9253,2.392,8.3163,0.5636,1.1228,2.3582,2.2255,2.655,0.0034,0.0901,4.1037,0.0137,0.2485,0.0015,0.3067,1.0413,3.9568,1.4535,0.4843,1.4827,1.7294,2.4091,3.9817,3.8374,0.2102,5.719,6.6529,0.5019,1.5522,1.8093,0.4565,3.4233,2.202,4.2884,0.1941,0.1245,5.8599,8.0734,14.2663,5.1954,1.1208,2.8481,2.6259,2.3668,0.0367,0.9044,2.2853,2.0282,2.1618,1.0676,0.5473,0.0615,1.3453,0.0367,1.7255,0.033,0.0231,0.0119,1.2453,0.2507,1.0358,0.7275,0.3506,0.5471,2.8465,3.296,3.4081,2.3354,0.1771,0.02,0.0535,0.7366,0.0004,0.0149,1.1601,0.0033,0.1989,1.4773,4.8669,1.1651,1.9409,3.4725,4.4938,2.9957,1.9218,0.6091,3.1383,1.7263,1.7036,3.0718,8.1574,1.7637,1.584,0.0732,4.4029,0.2113,0.8937,0.0024,0.1088,0.897,2.4179,4.5033,2.0683,1.0814,0.3484,2.2398,3.6791,2.5125,5.1859,0.8336,1.9392,5.3424,0.295,4.0913,1.36,5.8275,4.1427,2.6103,2.1801,1.3169,2.2044,1.4342,1.3324,3.1102,0.2491,0.0863,2.6215,10.9607,1.2674,5.2812,11.1483,2.0056,1.6488,3.1212,2.2817,1.1868,0.1359,4.4636,0.2691,2.5593,0.0054,3.0749,4.8056,0.0028,0.1018,0.0034,1.219,0.3386,3.1578,4.9823,0.8576,9.0352,0.8855,1.0901,5.673,2.3465,2.3179,0.784,6.3012,0.3591,1.3672,6.9483,6.6303,7.0666,3.6185,4.5309,0.0398,6.347,5.057,1.1421,0.0013,2.7744,3.6955,6.4087,0.6138,2.3244,0.0071,1.2055,0.0021,0.1497,0.9947,4.2965,0.0211,0.0024,0.5865,1.059,1.7704,5.6554,7.8183,7.3743,1.0182,0.1726,0.0008,3.3171,2.3758,1.1344,0.0331,2.9899,0.0008,0.0613,0.0012,0.0766,0.2784]}

The US constitution did not grant Congress the authority to regulate the heights of buildings. It is not known how many of these claims to the public realm had merit, but it is understood today that many cities banned the growth of new buildings above a certain height, particularly in Europe. As a result of these attempts in the United States and other countries, skyscrapers continue to grow only where they are approved by local governing bodies. In the early 1900s, the height of skyscrapers did reach new heights, in some cities such as Chicago and New York; some skyscrapers, some of the most tallest, were built in Moscow, Paris, Tokyo, Osaka, and Shanghai.\nSince the 1920s, many cities have seen laws aimed at controlling skyscraping. To encourage their growth and to curb their height, planning laws have been adopted, and the idea of the height limit of skyscrapers has become a feature of urban planning in many developed countries.\n^ \"In the United States, skyscrapers are a characteristic aspect of many metropolitan areas.\", \"City Skylines\", Retrieved 2010-07-08\n^ \"What makes skyscrapers different\", SkyNews, retrieved 2009-04-26\n^ \"Manhattan Highest Tower Records Its Own Height\", CNN, retrieved 2008-08-10\n^ \"Skyscrapers on a Roll\", retrieved 2008-08-10\n^ \"Global skyscraper boom\", BBC News, retrieved 2007-08-12\n^ \"Global skyscraper boom\", BBC News, retrieved 2008-10-31\n^ \"Kitchen renovation in new build home\", Retrieved 2010-04-10\n^ \"Residential architecture in new build\", Retrieved 2009-04-06\n^ \"James Martin (Skyscrapper, New York, October 2008\", Retrieved 2009-07-03\n^ \"Pictures & Video of the Skyscraper\"\n^ \"Top 6 US Buildings by Maximum Useable Height\"\n^ \"Federal Highway Administration Building (National Capital Region)\"","token_len":444,"entropy":[9.4058,3.3812,2.3804,2.6847,5.1745,0.5061,4.7232,9.1728,1.606,3.4282,2.2435,6.7507,0.0719,10.5002,0.0272,0.0017,2.0171,6.5328,4.7766,5.3199,0.0195,1.6112,3.1482,15.5489,2.3659,0.6448,1.8547,3.3857,5.3179,3.7609,9.0343,5.3675,2.0697,0.603,2.3002,6.1399,5.8856,4.4446,0.1671,4.5846,4.6113,0.4031,1.8872,0.0458,1.8489,1.4416,6.0653,0.2581,1.3572,1.5171,4.1391,3.0793,2.267,2.7902,1.5579,0.9151,2.4913,0.8036,5.0777,6.1745,1.7232,5.6662,4.8729,3.5186,3.4284,1.4426,0.79,2.1208,0.8105,4.5812,7.2943,0.1889,2.9238,5.6451,7.9921,1.6328,3.7336,0.0428,4.152,1.6327,5.6777,3.669,0.2327,0.8397,1.9155,4.8882,1.3958,6.6981,0.8469,4.4861,1.6037,0.2049,2.2789,1.5286,4.0074,4.121,1.2242,1.6129,0.0062,3.5071,1.5815,0.6793,0.1745,2.4359,0.1504,0.0065,4.8281,0.0194,1.3511,7.0301,4.7811,1.7042,1.1788,5.1233,0.6727,3.2818,7.1839,0.1047,0.5084,3.0185,1.9611,3.6139,2.0058,0.2221,0.3655,1.7411,3.6662,0.2841,3.0545,0.1471,0.0474,5.522,6.2606,4.8024,0.0545,2.3352,4.5489,3.5416,2.4974,3.3584,0.0049,2.1611,1.452,1.3287,0.0671,5.6309,3.8776,3.7662,0.0484,0.0102,3.5555,6.5848,2.272,4.1021,2.5575,7.4484,1.3363,1.1053,1.5956,1.0734,7.0441,1.1407,5.4174,0.4775,4.0471,0.4565,5.003,0.4104,1.1616,2.794,0.3627,1.797,11.9916,1.1499,2.3501,0.0419,0.2436,3.1122,2.2097,0.4317,4.9398,8.1448,4.2451,0.0506,3.5928,2.6989,0.1747,3.6352,1.4477,5.8128,5.2024,5.1633,1.836,3.4044,1.7858,5.0543,2.5745,5.5861,0.5042,8.1154,3.4203,0.9044,0.4881,2.9144,2.2798,2.2442,2.5701,6.0749,0.4209,3.7107,2.8996,1.8063,4.6883,3.254,0.0626,0.6193,0.3974,2.2147,1.2501,6.5575,0.1445,2.8235,0.6021,1.9219,1.6145,4.0981,0.2456,0.2504,2.0517,9.6211,5.8232,3.7312,1.9063,1.5702,0.0252,0.4485,2.657,0.1146,0.3441,1.0555,3.413,7.2139,5.4094,0.0386,4.3377,5.0092,0.4382,8.9335,4.2767,5.4337,7.9703,2.9205,2.0074,7.7038,6.8445,0.8824,2.8534,0.0139,3.8567,2.1816,2.1217,0.8261,5.5011,3.7989,0.9167,0.0505,0.4077,2.423,5.3549,6.4664,6.1128,0.9213,6.565,2.4404,0.011,2.6392,0.0008,3.7216,0.4532,0.1399,0.402,7.9559,0.131,9.9126,2.3822,7.4173,8.217,4.0398,3.04,1.0312,5.955,0.7402,0.4531,2.5241,0.002,2.7186,0.0007,3.3266,0.2369,0.0862,0.2772,6.6177,0.0528,0.3955,0.404,5.0086,3.407,4.5351,0.846,9.5254,1.9171,0.0013,0.6855,0.0007,1.1529,0.3038,0.1021,0.2488,6.2807,3.8036,0.735,4.7665,1.3824,4.7537,1.1039,0.2727,0.1378,2.0938,0.0014,2.0329,0.0007,3.0303,0.2579,0.0689,0.2141,4.2878,0.6532,0.08,0.8915,1.0939,1.5773,0.0749,0.0637,0.0302,2.2629,0.0008,5.2522,0.0009,4.2153,0.2801,0.0794,0.1708,10.6206,0.0313,8.4516,3.5831,6.1688,6.2788,7.8774,0.7661,5.6943,1.0948,0.0015,2.9096,0.0005,4.2028,0.223,0.057,0.1228,6.7145,0.4858,7.205,1.5597,4.5256,1.8615,3.5615,2.2696,2.4607,0.0009,0.9896,0.0007,3.96,0.2291,0.0452,0.1102,9.21,6.5331,5.4708,6.9061,0.0064,6.2509,1.3315,3.8473,3.3216,0.1517,2.417,6.6079,4.6339,5.499,2.3864,1.729,0.0009,4.4636,0.001,3.2273,0.8751,0.0187,0.124,6.8037,0.2537,6.4815,4.1909,1.1564,2.0034,2.5917,0.0006,0.1204,4.0403,3.8181,0.3292,0.2221,5.5471,5.6374,4.1411,2.2128,4.2941,6.0466,8.6247,6.7098,0.9171,2.6642,1.0392,0.1164,0.1333,8.2963,5.5047,1.4811,3.6494,4.1705,7.0243,4.7295,0.6677,3.523]}

The expansion would require the acquisition of more land. Following negotiations in 2002, the Government gave F & N permission to use the site.\nIn June 2000, F & N held a public auction to sell the site of the spring. The winning bid by S G M Holdings Limited was $14.5-million.\nOn 4 November 2000, the Ministry of the Environment granted the mining licence. The licence gave F & N the rights to extract the water and rock, and to build dams and reservoirs, during 25 years. The licence also allowed for mining to be suspended if conditions became unfavourable.\nIn November 2006, the Ministry of the Environment ( MOE) released a technical report to state that no additional conditions were needed. However, later that year, following legal action by the Singapore Environmental Council, the MOE agreed to impose additional conditions.\nAt the same time, the MOE noted that the spring was on the proposed conservation area, which would be enlarged if it was determined that the spring is of regional significance.\nIn the report dated 20 December 2006, the MOE noted the need for the Government to acquire more land.\nIn February 2007, the MOE said that the new site required \" considerable works to ensure safe water flow \".\nIn May 2007, F & N had applied to the MOE for permission to extract water again. F & N also stated that it hoped to reopen the source for recreation within two years. The authorities had also stated that some of the dam walls could be lowered to allow greater access to the spring.\nIn September 2007, the Singapore Environment Council filed their second public petition asking the MOE to retain a moratorium on the construction of a reservoir on the site.\nAt a news conference on 9 December 2007, F & N Chief Executive Kenneth Loh said that although the spring's flow continued to slow, the source was still considered to be adequate for its usage.

The company grew through acquisitions in the 1980s and expanded into the European markets. \n1989\nIn 1989 Monster Cable formed a consortium with the Dutch company B&C Electronics and other American companies. They bought a 90% share of the former Cable Television Research Institute (CTRI) and became the world's largest manufacturer of twisted-pair audio cables. \n1990 -1991\nThe second major cable scandal, caused by BRC cables and subsequent retractions and penalties by the FCC to the industry, left many companies wondering if the industry would be able to recover. \n1991\n\n1996 -2002\nIn 1996, the major US cable companies, including VCRI, agreed to spend $100 million to upgrade their cable networks. During 1999, VCRI acquired its neighbor and competitor, Cablevision Systems of California. They formed BCRI and invested $280 million into a new facility in Fresno, CA. However, the same year a series of financial troubles lead the company to file for bankruptcy and VCRI was purchased by an insurance company. \n1998\n\n2003 -2006\nIn 2003, VCRI was once again purchased by BCRI, now known as BCRI Systems Corporation. The company acquired two more firms, Digital Cable Television, Inc. and Telsy Inc. This resulted in the expansion of the company and the production of additional products such as coaxial & RF. The cable companies also invested into research and development by improving the materials used. In 2005, the company merged with Advanced Electronics, Inc. and named itself Advanced Electronics for Cables. In 2008, BCRI rebranded themselves as High Performance Media.\n2012 -2013\nIn mid-2012, BCRI introduced high quality RF coaxial cables with improved RF performance and the first-ever RF coaxial cable with an integrated XLR-TRS jack that allowed cable connections without a transformer.\n2018\nFrom 1998 -2018, High Performance Media expanded into the European markets. In September of 2008, the company acquired an additional 25% stake in BCRI Systems.","token_len":445,"entropy":[9.5701,0.267,11.2884,7.3995,6.2804,6.2186,4.2474,0.1159,9.2919,0.9872,6.2006,1.1134,0.7889,1.35,7.4835,0.4092,5.2264,1.2711,2.7168,5.1544,5.1643,3.2318,5.4647,6.8128,4.1919,1.5103,12.9006,11.4775,6.5018,5.2506,2.7951,2.0701,1.6691,6.1944,5.9125,3.2208,2.6641,1.2469,1.3642,0.1,0.8826,7.6413,1.332,2.3336,7.7325,2.5775,1.0039,7.2021,5.7052,9.3086,2.766,4.2064,1.8511,1.827,0.1288,6.9807,1.847,4.8217,0.931,2.6885,6.0977,1.77,4.7875,2.9986,3.4591,4.2512,2.0196,5.0391,5.3398,1.3501,1.5285,3.0343,3.3878,2.8239,5.1123,1.2951,2.2395,0.9814,1.5878,7.3015,4.7336,4.8788,7.1156,3.0039,1.5668,1.2684,0.4875,0.6401,1.6628,3.9989,1.2542,2.9293,0.0543,0.6154,5.0341,0.0945,9.4165,0.775,1.8794,1.1882,1.3732,0.4166,1.868,0.3478,1.0109,3.9095,4.9003,0.8763,2.3273,5.1863,3.9596,2.5712,8.0027,3.7307,5.6274,0.0983,4.2542,7.8279,10.5813,3.0474,5.8029,9.6412,0.1195,3.7766,9.5137,3.3088,1.0214,1.927,5.2463,2.1151,4.3818,0.2934,5.114,3.128,2.7334,5.9841,1.5882,1.7463,2.4583,2.1384,2.1965,1.2484,0.0103,3.0874,1.7993,1.1606,0.391,1.8497,2.0093,4.0154,7.0732,0.969,5.4369,0.5794,14.8672,2.3836,1.2287,1.681,6.4901,4.3217,0.2514,0.8226,1.9467,1.6737,14.2342,8.5942,0.4785,5.139,0.0685,6.9201,0.5374,3.0808,0.1538,0.6807,4.1184,1.1793,1.9899,2.5558,1.1334,6.3312,6.563,0.5938,6.5441,0.002,4.0556,4.7154,9.0956,4.0902,2.9828,1.3934,3.4681,1.205,5.1231,4.9943,3.8386,1.0013,4.8062,5.7741,9.3684,6.0667,2.6744,4.6357,0.4879,7.7387,0.0293,2.6116,3.2158,1.2643,5.1872,1.0183,5.8571,0.4949,1.7362,0.4532,6.2117,0.0415,1.7542,6.0727,0.9034,4.1917,4.2939,0.0096,6.3221,4.124,6.2625,3.7741,1.5031,0.2211,5.6375,0.1747,0.1981,1.9475,8.3785,0.001,1.9288,4.8493,0.1286,5.3905,4.4355,0.1691,0.747,0.8896,0.1328,2.5144,1.1658,0.0011,4.0074,0.5104,2.1137,0.1837,11.9986,2.6426,0.2773,6.0286,0.003,2.6354,6.0819,0.006,3.8519,0.0313,4.7472,0.0043,1.8647,5.0431,2.1784,0.0216,2.8886,2.5029,4.9699,4.5834,0.4618,2.1133,1.4335,3.9789,4.4292,4.0708,6.1749,0.943,5.5773,2.9263,4.4232,2.287,1.9351,0.5434,0.4403,5.44,8.1216,4.4181,4.8401,0.6752,4.5457,4.3402,0.0017,1.5248,5.7867,0.0882,1.1499,1.7088,2.7578,1.3963,6.0488,0.2695,6.344,4.2423,2.8564,0.0016,6.4553,0.186,6.8413,6.356,3.5077,2.5323,4.5465,1.8361,2.3152,3.0839,5.0029,5.7103,0.755,0.0707,5.6903,9.5465,1.2175,8.061,1.348,3.6158,2.8514,2.1389,0.2578,1.3384,1.125,3.6777,0.0794,6.7843,4.8942,1.8208,0.8937,0.3746,2.1222,7.1834,2.5414,3.7354,3.5783,5.9679,7.761,0.9668,0.602,2.9783,3.0925,0.2206,2.9881,0.002,5.2377,0.6513,4.3798,1.0915,6.8102,2.9054,5.4443,2.3552,1.8418,8.4748,0.7649,1.8909,0.1407,8.0029,5.7846,0.1215,1.3331,0.1042,3.3164,0.0028,4.9611,6.5001,1.6389,6.4922,4.9832,0.1825,1.6586,3.0936,4.3792,5.0471,2.5463,1.6414,3.962,2.852,4.1412,0.1182,5.169,3.2279,0.0535,0.6836,2.7467,3.0693,2.5488,7.5213,0.031,3.3859,7.7636,4.4649,4.0803,3.7775,4.5287,5.0833,6.16,4.791,2.3108,5.1551,0.4899,2.4395,4.5254,1.1405,15.8556,6.4246,3.0929,5.6851,0.2316,6.4777,0.5167,0.8112,4.323,0.943,1.7437,2.7194,0.9009,1.1627,1.6956,3.6158,2.5845,6.4665,0.1135,1.3349,0.4862,2.7228,4.2941,2.393,4.2612,0.4217,0.5082,0.1139,6.1729,0.0066,1.7807,1.5025]}

She has also played a recurring role as Mistress Faye Plunkett on the television series Alias.\nAfter his death at the hands of a demon hunter, Richard becomes her protector, preventing her from succumbing to the same fate.\nIn an interview with TVLine, Rose said she was deeply honored to work with the man who had taught her at Carnegie Mellon University.\nShe also called him a \u201creal gentleman. \u201d Even after the death of Richard, Rose kept in touch with Wyatt, who also worked at the university, by sending him money to the end of his life.\nRose says she has \u201c a wonderful family in Pittsburgh. \u201d When asked if he and her husband, John, know the identity of the demon behind the mask, Rose replied \u201cthat\u2019s a little difficult to tell. \u201d\n\u201c You know, I\u2019m not going off the record on that. It\u2019s a little difficult to answer, \u201d she said. \u201c That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to you to know. \u201d\nRose also worked on Doctor Who \u2018s season 12 and Doctor Who: The Devil Is A Spy. I think it\u2019s great that she also worked on an episode of Alias last season, which we haven\u2019t seen yet. After that, she\u2019s also seen her name mentioned on the list of candidates for Season 13 of Grey's Anatomy.\nAnd the actress was also a contestant on Celebrity Wife Swap, a reality dating show. In her personal life, Rose dated George Clooney three times, and there were even rumors that they are currently dating again.\nIn 2008, she attended the Kennedy Center Honors Gala with Clooney and fellow actors Sandra Bullock, Ryan Gosling, Jennifer Aniston, Bradley Cooper, George Clooney, and George and Amal Clooney, among others.","token_len":445,"entropy":[10.6605,5.2845,8.7564,6.5631,1.7462,0.4422,1.1652,5.7212,4.8744,1.3847,10.9066,14.3637,3.9057,4.0251,2.0104,7.6247,6.1125,4.0688,1.7406,3.4217,1.8495,4.9514,7.7684,11.5014,3.2483,10.5717,9.2974,0.4458,0.2103,6.2097,0.7763,4.9204,0.0158,2.0452,5.5348,5.612,8.3875,2.678,3.269,2.6041,7.0238,2.0534,1.8863,16.1448,1.5331,3.4229,0.0159,6.0409,3.9383,0.5608,1.9262,5.0312,2.5726,4.05,4.3987,1.3903,4.4322,0.1527,2.7672,9.3064,8.7903,0.3395,8.0969,3.1835,0.0147,3.7096,0.9381,3.5151,0.4231,7.2512,1.0358,1.473,0.7462,5.2447,3.503,1.6049,3.7319,0.3094,0.2101,0.0009,2.8583,2.6101,3.647,0.698,3.901,4.1351,6.2676,3.3075,1.4942,7.8466,1.9843,0.0796,6.516,0.0008,0.0659,0.9654,3.5557,1.8527,1.0269,1.2725,2.8686,4.0581,1.6768,0.3118,4.9999,1.0592,0.68,6.1989,1.9272,1.7348,2.0701,5.3464,5.963,0.389,3.3211,0.1589,2.7045,5.6257,0.9418,2.7898,4.5187,0.0831,6.6289,6.9236,0.6315,1.6853,1.5087,0.9832,2.2939,2.4675,4.8848,1.1336,0.9961,16.5786,6.2159,7.5599,4.5211,1.8479,4.8976,5.7768,6.2614,2.4852,2.2064,2.1765,0.0519,2.8648,0.3888,1.7585,4.7604,1.8399,0.1024,0.1709,7.3286,1.5152,1.012,4.1396,3.2291,2.4531,1.4575,1.6202,2.2574,5.096,3.3671,1.1955,4.8506,1.5854,5.5867,6.0188,0.4131,1.6426,1.2128,0.4686,0.4446,1.8918,3.7021,1.0588,2.802,13.5755,1.6904,7.2867,5.7,3.8582,3.8834,3.16,0.8317,2.6913,0.2238,4.8826,3.0577,1.4929,3.279,4.4119,1.9468,2.757,2.4721,4.1172,0.6732,4.9002,3.136,3.8827,0.0215,0.5251,1.3004,5.9172,0.8532,2.3737,0.2933,0.393,2.2369,5.0535,1.1818,4.8434,9.3889,9.5497,5.2519,2.3077,3.7067,3.45,1.4206,2.7608,0.8928,2.292,0.143,1.4114,4.2761,3.2866,7.1045,1.7796,0.5827,1.5602,8.2674,6.3492,2.5754,2.0797,2.5649,8.8671,1.8036,1.9097,2.0835,0.5986,0.9049,3.2015,2.2147,1.2633,1.5844,1.3054,1.1894,2.3556,0.7913,3.9406,2.683,4.0235,0.9416,7.0676,1.0185,0.3256,1.0024,4.14,4.1912,3.1134,0.2015,0.2556,3.2068,2.887,2.8056,0.0562,0.049,2.2996,0.9851,4.5824,1.4421,1.7842,1.8936,1.2329,0.0986,1.5433,1.6064,2.4301,5.4674,2.1602,7.5061,0.369,5.5863,5.1816,6.9205,4.6822,5.1538,3.4316,4.2103,0.0616,1.5176,1.1634,6.6364,2.9739,3.2566,4.2178,1.7604,6.1984,2.126,2.0116,3.8057,0.2353,0.0804,3.1578,1.2551,1.6948,5.7384,1.1247,0.2626,5.0006,0.8374,0.3565,6.0201,0.0051,5.1669,1.4062,1.6407,2.099,3.8315,4.7561,1.1309,0.6153,0.1716,0.5574,1.7258,0.3348,6.7217,1.234,0.448,1.3324,2.5574,0.0343,0.5734,4.241,5.569,4.4997,4.3209,2.6896,1.9947,1.0807,5.2903,0.1114,6.4459,0.4253,5.4935,1.5052,1.8914,7.9108,0.2737,0.0092,0.0,0.5341,0.7166,4.1939,4.1625,4.9093,4.0469,1.4926,2.3797,4.2208,0.2988,6.9582,5.3446,0.4369,1.5819,1.998,1.4028,5.5499,0.4465,1.8031,4.4499,3.1587,5.7778,1.3219,0.1641,0.9387,9.1118,7.4935,1.3935,0.0001,6.3247,0.1034,1.2134,1.4873,5.6282,1.8076,3.2952,2.6481,0.5756,3.1659,5.5969,3.7682,1.285,5.5618,0.1834,0.4542,3.3571,4.9852,0.1005,1.6158,4.4304,1.2062,7.2987,0.1599,2.4448,0.0367,3.3324,0.0053,3.3745,5.4403,0.0024,1.4722,4.201,4.1692,6.2744,0.2665,0.0,1.0906,6.2003,0.8538,0.0001,0.4834,4.9976,1.5779,0.0,0.4467,5.9238,0.0745,0.4001,6.1711,0.2081,0.0045,0.3076,0.9723,5.1262,7.6303,5.8823,0.764,0.0244,0.0009,2.1439,2.538,0.3427,0.0903]}

He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed a violent temperament. He retired from the Metropolitan Opera and became a full-time writer.\nIn 1916 Leno published a series of articles in the New York Daily News called The Opinionated Musician, in which he denounced modern opera for adopting American-style sentimentalism, and for his view that opera must make a profit in order to survive. In the course of his writings he was a strong proponent of the German-language repertoire. When the German Opera Festival of New York City began to play German opera, Leno was invited to participate. He accepted the invitation but made no appearances during the first season, leaving the festivities to the music director, Albert Wolff. In later years Leno attended some of the productions of such Italian and German operas as The Waltz of the Flowers, by Richard Strauss, and Lohengrin, by Richard Wagner.\nIn 1919 Leno traveled in Europe to promote the European operas that had premiered during the German opera season. His first appearance as a reviewer on the radio was in the radio program The New York Evening Express, broadcast by the Columbia Broadcasting System.\nIn July 1922 Leno took part in a performance of Richard Wagner's Parsifal in Cologne. His only German opera appearance prior to this was a role in an earlier production of Das Rheingold in New York City.\nDuring a 1924 tour of Germany, Leno worked as an opera accompanist for Richard Wagner and for Karl Blossfeldt, the conductor at Bayreuth. In 1927 Leno played bass solo in a concert production of Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier.  Leno did not compose during World War II. He returned to New York and continued to write music. He was appointed as professor of music at Queens College, and in 1949 he was named professor emeritus. He became interested in playing the cornet in 1954.\nLeno died in New York City of heart failure on July 22, 1981, at his home in Central Park West, New York City.","token_len":445,"entropy":[10.7205,7.1418,1.9015,6.0963,3.4448,2.5569,13.4836,3.1465,1.7527,5.7326,4.2464,9.9501,0.2231,8.4804,3.2816,2.2624,3.0246,5.4691,0.9241,3.4942,0.0539,0.048,0.8995,1.5035,2.172,2.3228,1.0969,0.4897,1.7253,7.1366,5.7325,8.5613,1.0481,2.0378,3.1572,8.5675,1.7634,5.5354,4.2309,0.9817,1.6006,6.9197,0.8449,1.0745,8.8466,1.0107,2.4874,2.2611,0.7296,5.9018,0.1509,0.0796,3.7016,1.0186,1.4032,8.5334,5.3059,9.4273,0.2805,4.5471,1.6121,3.4308,0.0792,2.4655,1.8531,1.3702,2.3423,0.2248,3.1051,0.3325,3.702,2.6776,8.6073,4.4574,7.2416,0.7543,1.5044,2.3891,0.0326,0.08,4.0349,6.7447,3.0569,4.3499,7.5446,7.1888,4.3747,0.368,7.5962,0.0526,1.7971,1.5878,3.1869,5.1264,4.6597,0.1787,2.0739,3.876,5.7185,2.2494,4.9543,2.9748,1.4231,0.1112,3.049,0.4766,2.2731,2.021,5.495,0.0006,1.4325,3.5217,1.8318,2.9473,4.2054,4.0409,2.1079,0.0392,1.2835,5.9612,2.9831,3.1036,6.0035,1.7762,4.7312,1.9732,2.6186,5.6433,4.7857,2.3339,5.0254,0.0288,4.552,2.3804,3.3015,3.8339,8.9322,2.3513,1.6193,0.7942,0.0008,2.6272,3.1822,0.2613,2.5755,1.0347,1.4826,3.5868,2.5873,0.0996,3.554,5.0992,1.491,7.0494,3.6485,0.2711,3.4729,4.6461,1.8154,3.5809,1.6993,7.1786,0.5664,1.3091,5.0529,5.3493,1.118,4.7654,6.9753,0.4641,0.6785,2.5498,5.9774,0.0883,1.9753,0.0007,5.006,4.6705,0.8104,0.2568,5.7799,0.7716,6.1847,5.2601,2.3991,1.4427,2.6943,0.0027,0.0349,2.3907,8.0698,0.1403,1.9405,2.3044,7.7669,0.8078,6.0132,6.1884,2.9512,0.6248,0.919,7.9898,1.8137,0.0019,1.2559,0.3545,4.7979,1.876,0.6226,1.028,1.6479,2.8962,1.2669,0.001,5.4111,4.349,2.5992,1.1224,3.5023,1.2566,5.2385,6.5539,0.0805,4.3432,1.6293,6.3911,3.7282,0.3938,3.4992,2.6168,2.2081,0.499,3.0226,2.5539,2.4284,4.6521,0.859,5.5882,2.7954,0.9255,4.7864,0.7402,0.8059,2.011,5.5455,1.571,3.2994,3.0975,0.5281,3.2698,6.2892,1.5295,3.2858,2.6187,1.2665,6.4707,0.8468,0.1949,0.6707,2.8699,1.3656,5.6385,2.6371,1.4998,0.001,4.3849,1.4418,0.0152,0.9371,3.027,0.6511,7.2679,1.6571,0.0303,12.6013,3.3028,0.0052,2.3828,5.0037,1.0017,3.3994,5.4808,6.8005,2.4681,3.0644,6.7473,0.0023,1.8691,0.4445,2.6406,6.7125,0.4934,4.2531,5.8541,3.8996,0.3886,7.2355,3.3203,0.8776,3.1457,0.0509,1.8376,4.3077,0.0546,0.9428,0.6749,1.5657,3.4329,3.9531,7.5913,2.9002,0.5554,1.5453,0.8331,0.506,0.0014,4.6228,1.5378,1.7691,2.2524,5.794,0.0161,1.0906,5.6141,0.3917,2.7135,4.0703,6.4413,6.0589,6.0514,4.9396,5.795,1.2509,1.4431,2.7225,3.2816,10.3122,1.05,0.0052,1.6643,1.9745,2.8045,1.8099,0.0014,4.3977,6.6121,5.5501,1.2836,1.449,2.3245,7.1166,0.3478,4.7232,3.111,0.3937,6.0162,5.9412,1.9666,4.6805,0.519,1.5034,8.3223,11.4923,0.0019,4.6695,0.2179,5.4552,5.007,4.5389,0.0014,0.8266,1.0771,2.1934,3.3773,0.1837,3.0186,0.0166,3.4305,3.0531,0.7313,1.895,2.9688,2.1541,1.9456,1.9286,4.2153,2.6782,6.8998,0.2153,2.0979,0.811,5.6152,0.1308,1.6852,2.2252,2.3478,4.1677,1.1179,1.0397,1.9613,2.6741,2.8789,0.0027,3.5421,1.8469,3.7656,4.5495,0.0131,5.8244,2.2234,10.7797,1.1515,2.4135,6.7686,0.9712,1.1485,3.9391,0.0378,2.4892,0.9099,2.2034,0.0377,1.5151,3.7773,2.7827,0.1538,1.1808,2.5019,3.5323,0.0491,4.8111,1.8384,1.2707,1.9483,0.2382,0.219,5.585,0.0141,4.1872,1.4355,1.2081,0.0113,2.7654,0.1609]}

The remnants of Bret still featured the low-level center, and were believed to have dissipated over the easternmost Gulf of Mexico @ 1200 local time on Monday afternoon.","token_len":445,"entropy":[9.1135,12.7839,5.4905,0.0327,1.8606,12.0803,2.4225,0.014,6.9991,12.4509,4.6681,1.5742,2.3159,12.6833,0.4187,2.4387,3.7727,0.4362,0.4749,0.0254,3.8852,0.8723,0.6572,2.0499,6.4786,4.0986,3.1159,11.8781,7.0592,11.248,8.5872,2.4021,6.6991,6.8484,2.0256,5.0183,5.1145,1.5762,3.955,0.8906,4.7935,4.4694,0.0775,1.3669,3.2855,0.0597,0.6188,2.1344,6.054,5.7386,3.5833,3.0326,7.4734,4.7168,1.8025,5.7729,0.9896,3.0773,3.8994,5.348,2.7074,2.1967,7.6727,2.3748,3.1451,6.4702,0.0031,0.6787,2.8728,0.0067,0.2505,7.3361,0.8121,3.3434,4.9264,3.6832,1.9996,5.4795,0.1312,0.93,6.5205,4.0515,4.6318,0.314,4.1948,0.1506,0.1244,1.6133,2.9445,0.2119,0.0192,4.5268,0.0321,0.1548,8.6749,0.4707,2.3834,8.3876,0.597,5.3729,3.3065,0.3483,0.0423,2.5645,0.0197,0.1923,5.775,3.9387,0.0955,2.2663,2.7188,4.6761,0.9261,2.8691,5.0493,4.3105,5.2195,1.4526,6.0667,7.7852,2.8918,4.4243,5.2807,1.8809,7.4006,8.1125,2.132,3.1381,3.5716,0.5274,2.0303,2.7947,0.5619,2.7101,1.9852,0.2229,0.5366,0.2439,0.0761,0.1554,0.036,3.1786,2.1279,4.7981,3.9978,1.9897,4.9623,0.7446,0.4093,3.1095,7.5874,5.1377,0.4284,2.7558,0.2368,6.4705,4.2909,0.315,1.3464,0.1674,0.2139,1.3555,1.1805,0.7331,0.0009,1.3967,0.6924,3.8233,1.6102,0.7883,1.592,4.442,0.5348,3.0692,1.4827,3.2637,1.6772,2.6591,3.3542,2.5398,0.5069,10.0532,6.9832,8.1748,1.6058,1.7204,3.8692,3.6763,1.2354,8.7087,0.2781,2.6409,3.7476,5.0157,0.5891,5.2882,4.9605,1.5912,4.6681,0.6327,1.4247,0.0579,0.7539,0.1114,2.6166,2.8601,3.715,1.5569,0.6388,5.232,6.0447,2.7694,7.7664,0.162,0.5422,1.1367,5.0199,0.4218,1.038,1.4035,1.6148,1.8533,1.033,5.0249,5.5974,4.6955,0.0012,0.8021,5.519,0.0823,2.8442,0.237,0.0046,0.0005,0.0001,3.0948,2.336,0.9432,1.3418,0.1961,4.636,4.5257,3.1282,0.897,0.4706,0.1721,1.1693,3.8887,2.8865,4.3947,6.3369,0.3052,2.1014,5.9988,6.3194,0.5853,0.7293,0.1163,3.3981,2.8779,0.0431,2.5258,1.582,1.3581,7.2513,0.0058,0.6128,0.2013,0.6246,6.8813,3.6786,6.1789,2.9899,8.2836,5.8974,0.1044,4.2693,6.5045,1.8336,12.1081,5.2629,8.3377,1.9486,0.203,5.7012,8.6131,8.0047,0.1599,2.6169,2.2501,4.4833,0.8169,6.4449,1.3737,3.7297,1.196,1.5061,1.7869,2.5443,5.4996,5.2103,1.7479,4.7622,5.4786,0.0311,5.0905,6.8507,3.9023,0.8173,3.5082,1.7821,0.0246,3.4969,6.2897,3.3869,6.754,6.1822,0.7622,0.7996,2.8878,5.0107,6.6657,2.5284,4.9519,1.0208,0.0791,6.0188,0.0354,1.2957,1.2206,5.9051,1.712,8.1889,3.5656,2.6728,4.7266,2.4767,0.2594,2.9635,0.8368,2.1399,3.7987,3.38,3.4622,5.3749,2.3215,3.076,2.3609,3.0799,3.639,3.7611,1.2029,3.122,1.0194,2.9925,5.2101,0.1739,1.2589,5.0686,3.3974,5.0158,3.8179,0.4064,2.2508,2.3246,4.9122,2.4859,3.321,6.244,0.0183,0.9912,0.8893,2.5143,0.1841,3.5447,4.9463,5.9094,1.2901,2.3116,5.9762,0.9006,1.6763,0.8888,1.9083,0.1691,0.4229,0.2506,0.9344,0.3398,3.6192,1.6198,5.5319,4.0326,0.0382,6.7881,0.0741,0.0002,1.4949,1.8375,5.4617,6.0183,3.4165,1.0063,0.2046,1.526,3.8584,6.5287,1.4781,1.3481,0.652,1.9621,7.6478,0.0201,2.3393,5.6043,9.298,3.9413,5.6162,0.8356,2.665,7.1482,4.5918,2.3952,2.3074,5.481,0.0388,1.414,4.6192,0.0007,3.1273,0.7094,5.0874,5.5203,5.4501,0.8109,0.025,5.3929,5.5455,2.2287,0.0154,0.9844,0.5065,1.5667,0.1908]}
{"prompt":"Ghost in the Shell used a novel process called `` digitally generated animation `` ( DGA ) , which is a combination of cel animation , computer graphics ( CG ) , and audio that","text":"Ghost in the Shell used a novel process called `` digitally generated animation `` ( DGA ), which is a combination of cel animation, computer graphics ( CG ), and audio that creates a continuous animation within the confines of a single projection. DGA was intended to provide the level of detail required to allow it to be used in combination with motion capture ( film footage with markers on the actors ) and to create continuity in a movie shot with multiple cameras. DGA was also meant to give continuity in post-production by linking the animation to the film footage. Since that time, the animation has become increasingly more advanced, and many of the DGA techniques are now used in computer animation productions from a range of genres.\nThe technical advances in DGA technologies have allowed production companies to extend the scope and scope of its use. This is especially true if you consider that the use of animation in live-action movies can include characters that are only partially animated with some character components fully animated in CG, and others that are made using CGI to be animated for post-production stages. With the continued evolution of animation technology, it will likely continue to evolve and open up new areas of use.\nDigital animated graphics are animated graphics that are created using CGI technology. This has traditionally been the case with many cartoons and animated films using 2D animation and 3D design, which require a team of professional designers to create images for each panel in the finished production.\nThe emergence of animation technology in the early 1990s with advances in editing software and hardware, created a new breed of animators who were able to complete 2D animations with their own computers. This allowed production companies to take on roles previously reserved for professional teams of animators and reduce the price of digital animation.\nSince 2002, 3D technology has been used in production as a cheaper and effective alternative for 2D animation. As part of the effort to reduce production costs, many cartoons and animated films have chosen to use 2D animation over traditional 3D animation.\nThe advantages of 2D animation technology, such as the production of animation with very little effort, have led to the release of movies and video games of every kind, from blockbusters to feature films and anime.","token_len":446,"entropy":[4.5653,1.1919,6.2843,8.8125,2.3994,8.2207,7.1589,2.67,9.3807,15.6502,5.1841,7.1519,2.941,2.4947,5.6815,6.2227,2.4704,0.8093,2.4809,1.594,5.2583,0.0107,9.4863,2.365,1.8214,4.6833,3.541,3.9826,3.7687,0.8234,0.4617,4.4978,4.8142,3.3441,1.1363,5.7664,2.4043,5.0375,1.0809,5.4183,0.007,1.1038,3.2664,6.1467,1.5435,3.4363,0.0055,2.8724,5.8111,0.303,2.9491,2.4912,6.3897,0.1701,1.9211,2.5978,1.217,4.2974,6.6612,0.0283,1.2694,1.5317,1.0376,5.543,0.0115,5.3567,1.2251,3.6825,6.5142,5.2545,6.1978,11.5195,3.6262,0.7521,6.2024,5.3625,1.1745,3.4675,3.0204,8.353,2.1552,2.6562,3.416,5.4551,2.3373,3.2464,3.1842,0.6665,2.7129,0.0036,1.1898,2.2008,3.2137,0.0782,3.9251,8.7685,2.2258,6.0829,0.3886,0.1422,3.9617,6.825,1.305,4.8315,0.8212,0.9836,2.171,3.1108,1.2024,5.1688,4.9439,0.2985,0.2732,1.9934,4.5568,0.9408,2.318,3.2595,4.8576,4.2195,1.511,1.3185,4.0418,1.6735,0.4475,3.9517,0.0049,1.8276,1.9383,1.1805,1.7212,1.078,4.9385,1.6702,5.1526,5.8429,3.6557,3.4501,0.0083,4.1101,1.0644,1.8357,4.6538,6.3429,3.9606,1.1551,1.3112,0.002,5.7455,1.1999,2.3921,5.35,2.0573,0.1901,5.8418,0.9814,2.8034,2.1109,2.7779,0.043,5.5287,1.8663,1.7562,3.8551,2.1896,2.073,0.4187,3.7881,2.6085,2.1349,1.4049,1.8001,3.7538,0.0243,4.029,1.8161,6.2267,1.4969,0.0041,2.4917,3.4074,4.6969,5.9698,2.2783,1.2147,4.6039,3.3749,1.5297,5.1485,3.9655,5.6977,5.7786,7.4073,0.7301,3.4372,2.7586,2.0332,1.799,6.0039,0.3064,0.8742,5.829,4.5044,2.8699,4.1368,5.2555,1.9484,4.8062,5.7516,0.1678,0.0412,8.9046,0.7106,5.0029,1.4022,5.2692,2.9602,0.2574,3.1029,0.876,0.3421,2.1335,4.1624,3.3892,2.3445,0.0573,1.7922,1.663,8.1134,0.5571,0.6951,2.4663,0.415,2.5794,1.1862,0.9245,5.3016,5.8384,6.7036,1.9247,7.8206,5.0354,1.0327,1.2732,3.1132,1.1761,4.3239,3.4225,0.9148,3.0415,3.773,4.7868,0.3157,2.4346,1.0981,1.3458,3.9685,8.2352,1.2316,3.4512,0.7461,5.6911,7.5941,0.0137,1.6966,3.4822,1.0823,0.0019,6.88,1.7549,3.4421,4.5085,1.8475,6.9759,0.3055,4.3706,4.3528,0.7428,1.3936,5.51,2.9755,1.7952,5.3706,3.1594,1.1442,5.8903,4.894,0.2445,3.2128,2.0659,6.9524,0.0405,4.586,1.8054,2.208,1.1844,2.7435,1.1717,0.2821,5.4903,4.8632,0.0575,7.1119,2.7958,1.0415,4.7288,2.372,5.0667,0.9798,1.6059,5.4922,0.012,3.9347,0.0516,2.0239,1.7356,0.708,0.0072,6.5956,7.2043,0.0179,2.8585,2.3185,4.4322,1.1006,5.2608,1.1048,2.3299,2.414,4.8035,0.3805,0.1646,4.0204,4.6725,5.2706,5.6394,0.9802,0.1161,4.428,6.8581,1.8653,0.6852,0.0139,2.5541,7.1227,0.471,7.2741,0.4029,5.3098,0.8293,1.125,1.1948,4.6867,4.3059,0.165,3.1869,0.0098,4.497,0.1466,1.5981,1.2316,0.9405,5.1016,4.5572,1.4895,7.2234,1.6809,6.4374,2.7697,2.6899,4.6175,0.0069,0.5152,0.9664,4.0736,3.8718,0.0006,1.1576,5.2059,0.0972,3.0075,3.0099,0.1485,0.4949,3.1841,9.2938,0.8234,1.129,0.1854,1.253,7.9764,0.287,0.4845,3.6653,0.0016,0.6856,5.2703,3.0567,0.742,0.003,0.752,1.2314,1.7498,2.0513,6.2232,0.2068,2.139,0.0019,0.1681,4.7323,4.6702,2.1375,0.003,1.4853,6.979,1.4863,3.8278,3.3616,6.0494,2.4661,4.2784,0.8188,2.3375,2.7349,0.5122,1.6738,5.1008,0.0663,5.6725,2.1585,3.2604,0.1733,5.7257,5.6505,1.8796,1.7111,2.4568,6.3243,0.0043,0.6263,3.3211,0.1103,2.6139,5.4109,0.717]}
{"prompt":"The synthesis of aziridines from < unk > is another important application of the Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from < unk > . Though less widely","text":"The synthesis of aziridines from < unk > is another important application of the Johnson \u2013 Corey \u2013 Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from < unk >. Though less widely used, the < unk > route also provides the potential for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles. A wide range of 1,2,3-triazoles can be prepared from these aziridine starting materials, either by the reaction of the aziridines with a variety of amines to form hydrazones which can then be decarboxylated or by the direct aziridine-Cope rearrangement. An interesting example of the latter transformation, where a 1,2,3-triadiazole arises from the aziridine, was reported by Johnson in 1958:\nWhere a Cope addition\u2013decarboxylation sequence was employed is not uncommon when synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles. In particular, the triazoles of formulae A or Z in the above references are frequently the result of (indirect) Cope rearrangement by decarboxylation of hydrazone intermediates (such as the examples in references 10 and 14).\nThe < unk > technique is sometimes accompanied by a low yield and this is usually attributed to the presence of an undesired by-product. However, it may also be a result of a failure to isolate the aziridine product. For example, the low yield (32%) in Hazen et al.'s reaction shown above, or the reported failure to isolate the (E)-\u03b2-amino alkylidenemalonate when synthesized by the Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky and related methods can be attributed to the fact that after the formation of < unk > in the third step of the reaction, it is readily isolated by crystallization. Thus the procedure does not always allow separation of target 1,2,3-triazoles from the unwanted formation of secondary products. The solution to this problem can usually be improved by carrying out the sequence of reaction steps as many times as possible.","token_len":446,"entropy":[11.5323,0.4057,9.9147,4.3292,2.1401,2.1798,3.4996,9.9509,10.8595,6.4126,4.9798,2.6852,6.7632,2.7712,7.4166,0.6637,1.7237,11.5279,8.713,11.7291,4.7015,6.3152,4.6527,3.4452,5.7983,6.6991,3.6522,4.4482,2.1583,2.5502,1.4105,6.3347,1.5303,7.7449,3.0492,4.3836,0.508,0.0085,0.06,1.7866,7.5224,5.1329,3.2452,0.7749,0.9854,1.5141,6.1797,0.2441,0.0037,0.056,7.071,4.7079,2.3211,2.8313,2.6366,0.5051,3.1001,1.3775,0.0443,6.8011,0.6305,0.7742,1.2618,0.4186,0.4167,2.982,0.2428,1.5319,2.1232,3.7178,5.6699,0.633,0.0035,5.0724,0.2326,0.1765,0.2522,0.0916,0.1034,0.2818,0.0051,0.0458,2.2559,0.1516,4.559,1.4971,4.4237,4.3444,0.0578,5.4425,8.9469,1.7524,1.517,6.2139,1.9716,3.0839,4.6688,0.7352,2.4379,4.1112,0.2362,1.1583,0.2857,1.6147,2.7074,5.08,0.0122,2.6174,0.6546,4.0092,2.7514,6.8131,3.3403,5.094,6.2132,1.7691,1.4535,0.1037,6.6425,2.5711,0.0055,0.0187,0.0093,3.3053,3.6094,1.1103,5.5368,8.0134,0.4142,2.971,4.1328,7.8833,10.9735,10.1877,0.0237,0.0517,1.971,4.436,3.9267,2.9318,0.4655,1.5616,5.2629,8.167,4.302,4.1262,2.4654,3.8575,0.2631,0.129,0.1852,0.0099,0.092,5.0501,5.1176,5.6651,1.2433,8.9814,0.9454,1.3599,3.9704,0.1208,1.253,2.8999,3.4138,2.5904,0.982,4.2313,2.6676,4.6785,4.6434,1.8898,11.816,3.2694,5.5229,2.07,8.0236,8.7391,2.9798,0.2353,0.0019,0.0458,0.0666,4.6693,3.1508,4.0977,8.4191,3.4394,4.2527,5.5545,4.4612,0.6383,2.2292,0.0789,0.0452,0.027,0.0087,0.0508,0.1606,0.0015,0.0707,3.8997,2.1268,3.74,0.1674,1.526,7.0152,0.0936,1.6395,1.7738,7.0896,3.1201,3.0804,3.5623,5.9975,6.8923,4.0662,1.402,5.436,8.1221,1.1046,5.2295,5.059,3.4643,0.0057,6.3076,6.262,1.3096,0.3242,3.819,0.4555,1.3364,0.0032,1.2606,4.3161,6.5796,0.0381,0.004,0.0399,0.0976,1.0852,4.6891,0.1716,2.0562,6.294,0.0055,2.3897,3.5392,0.0069,2.8654,9.1319,1.672,7.8082,5.2774,0.9876,3.9441,0.8243,1.8809,2.3453,5.4529,0.2881,0.0031,0.043,6.3515,1.7115,5.464,6.6883,0.0343,1.676,5.8775,3.8698,3.0716,6.8796,1.5197,3.6466,4.0823,0.0744,0.6167,4.1018,0.0625,3.4883,4.9174,0.1601,6.8637,1.6743,0.1809,1.8416,2.494,0.0951,2.5868,3.0343,0.8316,0.3583,2.8506,1.7693,0.0234,2.089,5.5221,1.087,5.6164,1.0365,4.0627,0.1384,1.4531,5.5396,2.1079,2.9465,0.3744,0.1153,1.6509,5.2378,0.3325,4.0179,6.4119,0.9209,3.5114,14.0267,2.3223,1.327,0.0018,3.5878,0.0041,5.5036,5.6043,2.2264,2.6168,3.8924,0.861,7.5469,3.8032,0.6941,0.8311,0.6125,5.6597,8.1109,4.0791,5.0194,0.7724,3.5978,0.5885,8.738,0.4612,0.0744,9.7968,7.4213,12.765,3.0289,6.4647,4.6558,0.0617,1.8527,1.0921,4.1131,2.7954,1.6534,0.0122,2.5376,0.0887,0.0122,0.0012,0.0196,6.3868,7.2008,3.5688,4.3625,0.7155,0.7724,0.0924,0.7691,2.1328,0.0102,6.9894,1.478,4.415,0.0529,2.554,0.3582,0.0024,0.0646,3.3363,0.7833,7.2219,2.193,1.3641,0.3216,2.8134,0.588,3.2986,1.31,5.4774,3.7334,1.7837,7.1674,0.3298,1.513,3.8842,2.3661,8.2287,5.1503,0.1406,4.295,4.7696,5.5503,0.3198,9.8087,4.6616,0.3073,0.0736,0.1056,0.0081,0.0748,0.0717,0.0034,0.1375,1.8696,1.31,7.7682,7.1332,0.8311,7.0016,5.0214,0.836,2.5758,5.1995,3.6403,0.7521,0.1564,2.1242,4.7016,0.0961,6.7678,0.4441,8.821,0.5739,1.2667,5.4781,1.2418,4.8173,2.3411,3.0656,7.3705,0.262,0.0698,1.7995,1.3345]}

McShan, along with Emil Macha, recorded Jennings's performance. When his recording session for the station approached its conclusion, McShan told the station's manager to keep it. It would be a great piece of talent. A couple years later, McShan purchased the station ( that time under the legal name of KXRK ) and made his recording debut in Littlefield in 1957. He soon got a new station license - KLEA - and bought the former KVOW building - and named it KKQK. There, he would remain for another 17 years, until he sold his station to Lone Star Television Company in 1979.\nJennings made his first national commercial recording to the Glee Club song \" Who Cares \". The song was produced by Barry Goldberg and had the title on the back cover. It peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 20, 1995, and has since made numerous appearances on the chart. His other commercial projects include \" Dove \" ( featuring Diana Ross and Donna Summer ), \" What The Sunshine Do \" ( in the movie Gone in 60 Seconds ), \" Do What You Will \" ( the theme song to the movie The Last Picture Show ), and \" You Can't Make This Music \" ( a duet with Donny Hathaway and Donna Summer ), all released by Epic Records.

The building was originally designed as a hall, although the first version had to be closed, with the hall being expanded into a theater. In 1909, the current building was built, with a red stone facade and stone arches. After the 1906 earthquake, it was expanded to include a grand ballroom as well as an art gallery. In the 1930s, there was a plan to have the theater demolished and another built that could seat 3,000, although due to financial reasons, this never happened. ( The theater is currently going through an extensive renovation, and will reopen on New Year's Eve 2012 \/ 01 \/ 29. ) In 1995, a new Chinese Theater was constructed where an antique Chinese Theatre and a Chinese Village used to be located. ( The current building is currently being renovated and will reopen on New Year's Eve 2012 \/ 01 \/ 29. ) The 5th Avenue Theatre today is a landmark that symbolizes Los Angeles \u2019 Chinese community. Since its opening, a number of shows have been staged including the musical \" Treasure of the Ts\u2019ao Liong \", Chinese play The Tiger Mother, Chinese opera Qing Shi Xian Yue, Chinese musical \" The Emperor \", as well as numerous concerts. The auditorium has a total seating capacity of 1,680 ; the auditorium is equipped with over 400 state-of-the-art sound and light systems, and two balcony sections that seat about 440 extra patrons each. The balcony, which overlooks the Los Angeles City Stadium, has the capacity to seat about 400, thus making the total capacity for the auditorium about 1,280. The Chinese Theater has a reputation for being one of the most prestigious theaters in Los Angeles. The Chinese Theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 9, 1983.","token_len":446,"entropy":[8.3427,1.2445,11.9799,8.1663,1.8719,10.7641,7.2729,3.7699,5.6659,2.2975,3.5618,7.8668,1.7226,4.533,2.7435,14.4753,7.371,1.3783,5.7086,0.9208,4.1195,2.8094,0.4665,5.9519,7.5711,0.1027,6.1799,0.5267,13.4575,3.3185,3.9284,6.0017,6.3227,0.4819,5.3159,2.0494,4.7122,3.8079,2.9356,0.0648,5.0583,3.6367,0.7361,1.0951,1.8272,3.1819,1.5782,2.9915,5.9908,3.2677,1.1534,6.985,1.9567,1.1648,0.8869,4.2443,0.0012,1.0643,7.2528,2.9624,3.1475,3.4788,3.9787,0.9371,0.1482,3.8576,0.6159,1.3354,5.6259,7.353,0.2358,1.9806,5.5355,5.0187,0.5834,4.8039,4.5708,7.657,3.9176,2.271,3.4549,1.8968,6.3095,0.1688,1.5569,2.3057,0.9413,1.8481,4.7397,1.0456,4.4385,2.3039,1.6317,0.2743,7.7315,2.5553,6.0432,1.8727,4.2588,4.7954,2.8024,5.0917,0.1525,5.2592,3.8514,4.0413,1.2013,6.1355,1.5495,4.5018,2.3696,0.52,2.1264,1.1715,2.758,6.0818,0.372,1.058,7.0438,1.9288,0.6955,2.8025,2.9968,2.4511,1.9981,7.1588,5.122,2.1388,1.8875,5.8102,5.0697,0.1241,1.4473,4.6431,1.0412,5.704,1.0413,0.3965,2.7164,0.3767,5.2485,1.5007,1.2813,0.9413,4.7922,4.9452,0.013,4.9168,0.212,0.1492,2.3764,3.7839,0.4024,0.7161,2.3188,2.1684,2.4717,0.1431,0.3027,4.1354,0.5235,0.5969,6.2938,0.2807,3.4952,1.2897,0.9679,5.0756,1.9005,6.4441,5.637,5.9508,4.4316,5.8449,4.4388,0.0413,0.351,2.997,4.1985,6.2936,0.0084,4.9822,3.7176,0.663,2.4191,4.2608,0.8036,0.2295,5.4709,5.4669,2.4401,2.7705,3.0307,5.7113,1.0397,3.2834,2.4148,1.0649,1.9424,2.1277,2.349,2.6704,2.5151,5.4025,0.114,0.01,0.6138,3.7504,9.5909,6.4988,3.7906,6.2549,3.0831,1.9027,3.1846,4.9639,0.2345,2.5744,2.1855,3.9198,1.4851,1.0582,1.8947,6.1942,4.3627,6.4475,1.1912,4.4509,3.4385,1.8588,2.4814,6.5143,6.5384,0.2491,0.5353,1.7003,0.3604,2.8379,1.787,3.8626,2.209,0.4959,0.4485,3.4716,0.3584,1.6969,0.4103,0.1685,0.0518,0.1275,0.0118,0.0031,0.0628,0.0347,0.0313,0.1737,0.0189,0.1145,0.0883,0.1443,1.6487,3.8402,0.0407,0.0915,0.3046,6.3656,1.2989,2.0694,4.6166,3.3996,5.7081,0.0454,3.3457,0.0024,13.2609,8.0595,6.9185,4.2412,1.4342,5.3428,1.7461,0.6541,1.3617,4.6809,2.0321,0.0046,6.2993,0.3902,0.402,2.0858,5.1346,1.5037,5.4733,2.354,9.2155,3.308,0.4081,5.0989,15.4469,2.8429,10.002,9.6367,7.0066,6.7942,6.4448,5.9969,4.8565,6.8167,7.1927,2.4839,2.9158,3.4186,9.2635,6.4187,7.1486,1.8571,9.1331,1.5117,1.5773,4.2731,2.6552,2.748,6.1163,6.269,5.3953,0.0024,0.0064,3.8663,4.9769,1.8732,1.4648,7.4867,0.001,2.3366,2.1902,4.9016,1.7686,0.0505,0.0372,2.8482,0.0839,6.9079,8.1592,1.755,2.6373,0.0012,1.4602,5.3971,0.0511,5.2736,3.8147,6.2904,0.2154,0.0092,0.0042,0.0039,0.156,0.0027,2.5987,2.9745,3.7665,2.5227,1.6626,1.7033,5.8577,8.9806,4.1019,2.7918,5.5318,4.0514,7.7797,9.6348,4.0711,4.1075,0.3575,1.2234,7.685,4.8907,1.0324,4.0847,0.0022,0.4182,4.3508,0.0058,5.567,7.0461,0.5799,1.975,4.0039,2.9508,0.6308,1.1156,2.9295,4.0937,1.8985,7.6933,1.8575,2.1436,6.9525,1.5597,2.478,0.716,1.9757,0.0004,4.0232,1.5578,0.0372,5.1713,0.6544,1.1711,5.3738,0.5608,2.1566,2.0526,5.4984,0.4242,0.9134,1.7884,0.0114,0.1044,0.8619,4.4211,2.8177,0.1727,1.4762,0.0003,1.1578,1.6428,3.3711,0.3627,2.2155,6.8132,2.3094,0.3366,2.1442,0.575,0.0287,0.0193,0.0089,4.2088,3.1586,3.4645,0.0735,5.5079,0.9696]}

Himeji Castle in Hy\u014dgo was depicted as Tanaka 's ninja training camp .","text":"Filming of You Only Live Twice lasted from July 1966 to March 1967. The film was shot primarily in Japan. Himeji Castle in Hy\u014dgo was depicted as Tanaka's ninja training camp. It is now the national museum of photography. The film is known for its extensive use of real Japanese actors and actresses. Director Akira Kurosawa used one of his daughters as a main actress in the film, making it the first time she played a lead role in a film. There was also a long period of shooting on top of Mount Fuji. It was the first film ever shot from that mountain's top. Several scenes in the film were filmed at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.\nIn the film, Happosai (Hiroyuki Sanada) is a young ninja who trains with two senior ninja, Katsutar\u014d (Yasunari Tsutsumi) and Shigeyoshi (Akio Tsubasa), who are both his older brothers. When his mentor is killed, Happosai is assigned to investigate his supposed killer and find out what his goals are, in order to avenge his mentor. He finds a mysterious sword hidden in a nearby cave and discovers that the killer uses it to control people. Happosai confronts the master and gets killed, but he uses his powers to bring his dead mentor, Tengen H\u014dj\u014d (Mutsuo Sasaki), back to life. This leaves him completely disfigured, and he is given by the master as the new Hokage (head honcho ) in his place. H\u014dj\u014d sets off Happosai to take command of the village, in which several other events occur as Happosai grows up to become a great ninja, including the events of the film.\n\nInfluence\n\nIn recent years, there was a resurgence of interest in Japanese ninja culture, largely due to the manga adaptation Ninjas in Love (2004), which portrayed them as sex symbols, and the films The Last Samurai (2000) and Legend of the Five Rings (2002), which were based on ninja storylines from the Sengoku period. These films in turn inspired the manga and anime adaptations of Ninja Scroll and the Naruto series.","token_len":446,"entropy":[8.0394,3.4366,8.3769,3.7897,1.7573,0.2291,8.9797,4.2547,3.0193,7.3615,0.6905,3.545,1.0782,0.839,2.005,1.8968,1.0782,2.572,5.065,0.5877,4.8684,1.9869,7.6594,5.115,3.2149,8.2566,3.7196,6.3679,3.8188,3.3784,3.3278,5.9298,0.958,13.0492,0.4721,11.4902,4.5347,2.191,0.9344,3.1749,2.0625,4.7855,2.468,6.3019,2.8727,0.5721,8.051,1.1432,2.2465,2.0144,2.3061,3.7545,0.665,0.5535,5.807,2.8211,0.0524,5.6283,2.8523,6.1621,1.6242,3.8963,0.6548,6.6766,3.7521,1.8057,0.0577,0.004,3.703,5.6948,0.3572,1.3909,6.5566,1.1902,0.9825,4.0179,5.1725,1.4874,0.3477,0.4775,2.0147,4.545,2.2186,1.2587,0.8679,2.3532,1.8794,3.549,0.4546,5.7462,0.3091,0.4552,0.4671,1.5236,1.0961,5.2372,1.9957,0.7548,0.6134,6.4664,3.1556,0.3969,4.1297,3.5885,5.6422,0.0162,6.2583,0.539,1.686,3.3894,0.7411,2.7437,1.0466,2.822,3.9347,1.5986,4.6151,7.0136,2.6173,4.7167,1.7567,0.8732,6.3413,2.8925,2.792,0.2075,0.1812,0.7117,1.2696,2.3094,1.3348,7.1314,1.0885,1.5357,1.5412,0.7864,2.023,6.7113,1.6819,2.3149,0.6416,9.6729,5.3767,3.7742,3.0811,8.2123,0.3468,0.0808,7.1891,1.0392,0.3981,0.9845,1.9593,2.1758,3.7076,1.0538,5.1433,2.1952,5.0915,7.0992,3.2439,1.9414,5.8125,4.0699,5.8549,0.68,1.0952,2.8835,3.8988,2.5061,2.758,5.1514,3.3034,0.7976,0.5564,0.0432,3.5342,2.4266,3.4542,1.3935,0.0845,4.3761,3.0168,4.7568,2.3021,0.6842,1.912,2.4164,1.2761,2.8177,6.04,4.1342,0.7128,0.2267,3.9615,3.6771,4.3549,3.0415,1.1626,0.9092,1.0613,0.0094,0.0007,1.9405,5.6614,0.3338,3.7978,3.1392,6.807,4.1317,2.2942,2.8875,1.0086,1.3016,4.8346,6.2114,0.3813,3.0872,4.0687,1.3557,0.0212,8.1705,0.003,0.5473,3.5937,1.1387,2.1853,3.7525,2.1498,3.3487,4.5457,2.5919,0.505,1.145,3.3921,2.7994,1.6679,4.6259,0.9406,1.9835,5.8389,5.5031,0.4931,0.3094,4.6994,3.7581,1.1209,1.7252,0.0116,0.0009,5.6234,1.0806,4.7904,2.1318,4.3792,3.5547,1.7145,1.2528,2.3703,4.4877,1.0567,3.3618,0.1492,4.5309,3.0155,5.0027,1.0397,4.2305,4.196,5.9359,1.7075,4.394,3.1614,2.5035,0.4756,0.8632,3.637,5.3511,4.1149,5.8257,0.2394,0.2824,1.1653,0.3131,0.0479,0.4598,4.2502,4.5367,2.0193,5.0199,5.2634,0.5097,1.4405,1.0062,1.1344,1.6058,3.9128,6.086,1.7484,1.6757,3.8423,2.9269,2.9375,2.8914,0.0022,4.0708,9.0093,5.1833,0.0095,8.5592,2.773,2.7575,2.391,0.2456,4.2501,2.478,0.0134,0.0087,6.3634,1.9455,15.2215,0.0052,0.0014,2.0637,4.5129,5.9629,0.1253,0.5678,3.9184,1.1969,4.6209,1.865,7.2009,2.7104,7.9541,1.8749,3.88,0.8422,0.0047,0.0006,5.9509,2.6044,3.0243,0.2992,1.0927,4.1513,0.6158,2.4633,1.8758,1.3924,5.6011,0.7509,0.6884,1.9216,0.5945,1.1408,5.6863,8.9402,1.9719,1.4712,0.0002,2.7046,6.419,0.1267,0.2006,3.3935,3.3204,0.7415,2.6647,0.2824,0.5829,0.0716,3.097,1.4827,2.7948,1.479,5.2919,0.6848,0.0053,0.5232,6.5651,2.8159,10.6498,3.144,1.286,3.5689,2.4067,4.283,1.2147,0.781,5.2036,4.985,0.3118,7.9128,4.1754,2.3117,1.8678,1.4308,3.6607,3.0064,3.2023,0.7805,0.3353,5.2096,0.6212,0.0926,5.7949,0.2059,0.6737,2.1055,1.7538,0.1848,2.6702,1.7712,0.5357,3.4326,1.8416,0.1698,6.753,7.4018,2.7113,0.5318,6.9029,0.7288,0.0046,1.517,0.3667,4.0983,0.5421,6.665,1.129,2.4649,1.7185,4.0895,2.0332,0.3966,1.4944,0.6028,4.9086,3.9243,2.2767,2.4851,3.5982,1.506,0.8511]}

An incident","text":"After completing 100 % Love ( 2011 ), Sukumar began working on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident happened to the director about the film that led to his first big break. It was when Sukumar and Chetan Kumar, who had been involved in making the Kannada film Chandamama, came across the cast of Chandamama, when they wanted to make an uncut film on the subject of sex addiction. However, Sukumar felt uncomfortable doing the film because of the taboo of sexism and decided to make a film on its own. It was during the same time that Sukumar met an art director by the name of Ramayya ( now well known to all ), who suggested Sukumar to make a big budget movie. Sukumar was unenthusiastic about it and his proposal was immediately rejected. After that, Sukumar began searching for a suitable director. Ramayya finally persuaded him to take Chandamama to be the assistant director. His relationship with Ramayya was very close throughout the film. Sukumar became confident about the project and worked for it with his own funds. Sukumar\u2019s film, Chandamama ( 1993 ), became an overnight success for both Telugu and Kannada film industries. Sukumar said : \u2019 At the time, we were discussing how to put the plot together, and I realized that the scene will never work in India. Then Chandamama was made \u2018. Sukumar received numerous awards for Chandamama, including four National Awards.\nThe movie is the inspiration for numerous TV shows and even a TV serial. The movie has been translated in Hindi with a title, Chandamama. The Telugu version was made with two directors \u2013 Prashanth Neel and A.R. Murali. As a result of Chandamama it was decided that Kannada would become the medium of choice as it would be much easier for the audience to follow. The movie was titled as Love, based on the Malayalam movie that was titled as Love. It received three National Awards for best director, screenplay and costumes.","token_len":447,"entropy":[9.39,7.8283,6.6847,11.8355,3.9665,12.6707,2.6843,10.7988,4.1813,5.761,4.446,0.6896,1.9521,7.4111,1.4264,3.7534,7.2735,0.5158,0.0269,6.737,0.4994,3.4953,7.7644,4.3962,1.9526,2.8981,8.7046,1.2295,3.1583,1.3825,6.183,0.0032,0.0038,2.611,11.2405,1.5701,1.3331,6.0041,5.2072,3.5256,4.5096,2.7644,6.0985,6.0769,1.9605,2.7875,3.351,2.8179,0.4058,2.1825,5.6018,5.6604,2.1717,1.4418,3.8445,0.9409,3.1872,1.8651,0.0006,3.6889,8.5756,0.3522,4.7909,2.8214,1.4383,1.2443,1.6518,4.1299,0.2894,3.5061,1.1067,6.6858,3.05,0.1438,1.5236,7.276,6.4927,3.9285,1.3532,2.9562,2.5349,1.0695,7.2336,1.3199,3.9885,0.0769,0.0153,2.4362,5.0986,1.0006,4.6683,0.2284,2.4807,2.3186,7.1805,1.6883,1.5501,3.7597,1.0299,2.0858,1.2101,4.7006,5.2909,0.5093,4.7543,0.0783,2.8575,0.0002,3.6194,5.8138,4.868,1.5407,1.4219,1.6173,1.6418,0.73,4.7655,2.5302,9.6726,1.6265,7.2012,0.1913,2.271,1.2547,1.5442,1.6552,5.81,1.6183,0.67,3.5918,0.7136,3.6804,2.0276,4.4161,1.0742,0.3834,1.4527,0.0001,3.3539,4.8003,6.869,1.4287,5.5523,0.3663,0.018,0.2076,4.3644,4.1371,6.7901,4.8298,7.9217,6.7119,0.2738,2.3564,3.2595,6.0923,0.3641,4.5973,4.2457,0.0003,1.3706,2.579,0.6233,6.8496,4.276,2.7266,1.9669,2.0334,0.0001,2.5165,6.9997,4.195,0.0008,0.0007,0.0224,0.8186,2.7736,0.9821,5.6703,4.4793,0.7085,4.7554,1.0864,0.6551,3.277,3.8292,0.5051,1.1729,0.0002,3.131,6.7639,0.2041,1.2429,3.653,0.9748,1.5631,4.3492,0.0193,0.0024,5.2672,5.1333,1.7701,0.1733,2.5593,6.9099,0.0213,0.0048,2.0521,4.2204,3.5029,10.8678,0.2762,1.3329,5.0395,6.9696,0.047,1.6043,0.0153,0.0009,1.1774,2.5549,2.6069,8.0095,0.5504,2.0477,0.8401,3.6779,0.0002,4.1964,7.019,2.6564,1.0371,2.4155,0.812,4.8414,3.7891,2.7082,3.4805,2.4546,3.4475,5.0466,0.365,3.4302,0.0003,16.2574,7.6488,2.7512,4.3203,3.553,2.2716,0.0206,0.0043,2.6445,6.0752,0.7594,3.1429,2.554,5.7529,0.7321,4.5438,3.0646,9.5591,0.2422,2.0995,3.9859,0.0133,0.005,1.5941,4.6404,0.2481,3.6845,0.0002,5.1465,5.8505,5.4264,6.0578,7.4149,0.9246,0.821,0.9731,3.1354,0.8199,5.066,3.3663,0.7066,5.0895,1.9223,6.6479,0.8607,1.9942,1.7691,1.9394,4.475,0.2294,2.2022,5.7175,6.1865,3.134,2.9697,2.4776,3.5232,0.7464,5.387,8.0069,0.0226,0.0034,2.1427,3.2439,8.3559,7.8744,5.1362,7.4556,0.0007,6.532,5.6779,3.2789,1.7149,4.5832,0.0082,0.0038,1.7276,1.3668,5.9106,3.8006,2.1564,1.707,4.1026,3.976,3.6225,2.8702,4.0413,5.5991,0.431,6.6267,4.5663,1.0741,1.1742,5.7358,2.0346,2.5634,6.9652,1.1397,1.7977,2.4689,2.0265,1.4442,3.8134,3.8314,2.6721,5.1774,2.7413,6.6099,2.6015,1.5655,0.1201,0.0906,2.025,1.524,9.4888,0.0049,1.439,2.4407,2.4973,2.8579,5.2912,3.8607,4.6755,4.2412,1.1986,2.3965,8.4649,0.6217,1.1525,3.9749,1.7241,2.8723,0.1879,4.7736,2.1967,0.5369,0.642,5.0571,2.1043,1.2269,1.1907,5.2163,0.005,0.0057,5.8079,2.0185,4.2925,0.7931,5.9722,0.4654,0.0115,1.85,3.37,1.1178,5.6788,1.7057,2.9002,4.4365,1.8467,2.713,1.1817,5.0336,1.3863,0.9327,1.5131,2.3423,0.1846,3.083,2.1393,1.3958,2.1845,1.7046,6.0129,3.142,7.9719,2.8804,8.3657,0.0652,0.7638,7.8682,0.3671,0.1623,4.5408,4.3713,1.81,7.2069,3.0274,1.2425,1.5006,2.1379,5.3235,3.8627,3.8165,0.187,3.464,3.3482,4.0017,1.0928,4.9443,0.9266,7.4947,0.4527]}

He commented that he expected some guest star appearances to take place before season five. Davis said that for the rest of the show's run, the guest stars would still appear on the show every now and then. During the interview, he was also asked what he would like to see the television series to have in season, and Davis responded stating that we would see the vampires on the show at a few different points.\nThis would have been due to the production of the show already being halted while they were trying to find a guest that would fit the character.\nIn an interview on February 9, 2014, showrunner Jeff Davis said that he was hoping that season five would be the last series finale (despite recent speculation against the showrunner's claim).\nIn an interview with CBR on February 24, 2015, David Wilkinson, who plays the role of Dracula Vlad, said that they have not spoken about season 6 or series beyond season five.\nOn June 4, 2017, it was announced in a Deadline interview that series producers have begun discussing the concept of a sixth season of the show.\nIn June 2017, showrunner Jeff Davis and actor Jared Harris spoke concerning the possible cancellation of the series after season five :\nWe're thinking a lot about the potential for a sixth season of Buffy: Season 5.\nThis is obviously a very serious subject, and [ it ] would involve a lot of discussions [... ] I can tell you now that it really feels like that's the end of the sixth.","token_len":448,"entropy":[11.7732,7.1055,11.0394,12.5441,3.5792,6.1874,6.392,1.6351,2.0129,8.8714,5.1287,0.6751,1.9878,3.6926,2.0899,6.3683,3.7629,5.9282,6.6488,0.7265,1.7971,2.9643,2.4599,4.5517,3.2066,6.5092,0.6912,4.0374,1.9054,6.5876,0.1498,1.7641,5.7187,1.263,1.2184,5.594,4.1734,1.4886,2.582,3.3098,5.6115,1.0607,1.685,7.8645,0.5301,2.0397,2.7943,4.373,3.4095,2.0759,1.9107,4.947,1.7478,1.2302,0.3576,1.7981,4.4997,5.3784,4.3243,4.0284,3.0198,4.1999,8.2543,3.9788,3.5733,6.8995,11.1668,2.3021,4.5393,10.3988,5.2191,2.9262,6.1039,3.4409,1.71,2.0363,4.4174,3.4375,0.2758,7.3804,2.0034,5.2607,2.2013,2.0524,1.0878,2.9405,1.7404,2.182,3.3786,0.5896,4.7489,3.9098,7.5972,6.7466,0.5797,1.7519,2.9887,2.7257,0.0099,6.9148,5.9077,3.5965,0.8818,0.5279,2.5275,5.6575,3.7296,4.5584,2.2375,5.4674,4.1174,4.105,0.0664,2.5111,3.5893,1.666,3.078,4.2016,1.3917,1.8564,1.297,4.9043,3.8247,0.4023,4.3087,6.2672,5.862,5.8354,0.0676,1.2218,4.7947,0.7527,1.8191,2.6959,1.003,6.2068,1.0332,2.1216,2.417,4.3541,5.7,3.3711,6.3399,1.5838,5.7062,1.3564,1.4573,3.897,4.6576,2.1414,0.9693,0.6378,2.5395,3.5445,0.145,1.6801,1.4782,0.8515,2.271,3.2596,1.7692,1.0112,5.9191,1.119,4.6789,0.0367,0.2927,3.2304,1.6892,0.5362,0.3415,1.8852,3.2993,1.5681,0.687,4.692,2.3163,2.9453,0.6788,0.4645,4.5725,3.8604,0.0019,0.0644,0.8628,5.5462,0.9056,0.8093,0.1472,1.4698,3.1483,3.5977,0.075,2.7494,1.323,1.4601,2.2729,0.2551,0.1728,2.9389,6.4457,1.2415,2.1135,2.4471,2.0602,3.0537,7.6754,0.8249,1.765,1.6807,6.6042,0.4486,6.1466,1.633,3.082,2.3947,6.6566,2.9324,0.9431,0.376,3.4766,3.9283,4.422,2.1869,2.103,1.8961,1.3609,4.5119,3.8468,3.4198,1.2248,5.3207,0.1639,0.6919,5.9207,2.0351,1.0405,2.2741,5.965,1.8428,8.1135,5.1226,4.4035,0.9677,3.4763,0.0168,2.9616,0.9939,6.8685,8.1685,0.9366,1.8906,1.0688,3.0887,1.3137,2.8913,2.6119,2.4748,0.3454,3.2845,5.6577,3.2769,0.5855,3.2696,0.5182,6.8953,0.3005,2.2107,0.0349,1.7939,0.4746,1.0359,1.9471,4.0773,1.4986,2.5699,0.5711,0.2548,1.7756,2.6018,1.4146,3.7463,2.4498,3.8588,5.2197,6.6778,2.7113,8.6817,1.3946,2.0537,4.4325,1.2143,3.4519,1.6195,1.9525,2.2451,1.4369,0.2263,0.6143,6.8147,0.2357,2.6213,1.3179,3.4737,0.0611,3.122,0.1389,5.3071,9.5235,1.222,1.9416,2.9501,1.7472,4.7102,0.0373,6.5619,11.0539,1.0055,1.7784,0.2814,4.3511,3.3714,2.3744,5.4704,1.1355,3.2087,6.6768,3.6308,6.5752,9.575,3.6519,1.4681,0.7506,1.6479,3.3809,3.4991,3.2908,0.0685,3.0093,0.0951,5.0066,0.0741,0.8957,4.9777,1.6311,8.898,2.1199,0.1577,4.1652,4.2616,3.2857,3.7501,4.8005,1.3934,5.92,0.1497,1.5586,4.0897,0.2654,1.9181,0.7034,1.4369,0.6367,1.7239,2.143,4.1017,1.1401,0.0822,5.5627,0.28,1.9413,0.0536,4.547,4.763,6.89,4.4268,4.0351,7.4854,0.7359,4.3254,2.7817,0.0949,1.0409,1.9079,2.5286,2.6884,0.9666,9.0124,0.5143,4.2638,2.1026,5.401,4.0275,2.7527,0.2209,1.9163,4.207,1.1689,1.4488,0.5038,0.0806,1.7728,5.0484,4.9544,3.9053,1.7313,0.9934,3.2433,4.1228,1.6743,5.2192,1.2046,2.0224,4.0188,4.4205,1.4758,1.0482,8.0162,10.1055,1.5126,2.6812,5.1602,1.773,0.8794,0.0378,4.3023,5.2036,6.9708,0.6157,3.6257,3.8366,2.618,0.0534,3.4688,0.5982,2.8706,5.7386,4.5844,0.3136,3.1971,1.2419,1.507,2.8106,0.2031,0.6497,7.5965,5.9356]}

The album features Ch\u00e9 Aimee Dorval ( from the band Anesthesia) as the sole producer with whom he worked for more than four months: \"I don't want to tell a mystery, I said to Ch\u00e9 he has been great and I have tried to make this album more organic and we came to some pretty amazing results I think.\". In 2011, she wrote another album entitled Bodies and Soul, which is a compilation of several performances from the past, and another album of Townsend's solo debut, The Art of Living Dead, an acoustic and electronic concept album with contributions from Tim Hecker (from the group King Khan) and Danny Kortchmar (from the band King Crimson). Another solo effort, the mini-album Live (2011), was released in 2013 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the release of The Casualties of Cool.\nIn 2015, he began recording a new album, and, despite having his own studio in California, with the production of Jason Everman (who had also produced Townsend's previous two albums) for 10 months, was delayed by a disagreement with the producer. He did so in the studio on the Island of Kauai in Hawaii, with a different producer until the last week, as Townsend wanted something special and unique. The album, entitled On the Shores, was finally released in September 2015. The album contains Townsend's contributions to the works of the legendary musician and arranger Billy Cobham. The album won a 2016 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock\/Vocal Album. On October 27, 2016, Townsend launched the album At War with the World, containing songs written as part of his fight against the Trump administration. In November of that year, Townsend was asked to join the band Nine Inch Nails, for which he released the song A Place and, featuring vocals from Marilyn Manson. On December 13, 2016, Townsend was interviewed by The New York Times about his political views. In addition, he stated that he believes in the end of the world due to the rise of Donald Trump.","token_len":448,"entropy":[9.7105,8.2776,1.6134,3.487,9.7207,4.603,11.7416,6.2371,3.3525,1.5907,3.1145,1.5117,10.4623,1.7899,3.2812,8.518,0.8851,3.3631,5.9678,0.2438,6.5405,3.5109,2.4619,5.7023,2.1219,2.5551,0.0111,8.1462,9.503,2.2055,1.1426,2.0339,1.5949,3.8656,8.9807,7.9971,8.6187,2.9389,2.0659,7.7857,3.9441,3.6989,10.9926,2.3247,3.5572,7.0449,5.2764,3.3363,1.4989,1.7406,5.9192,3.3203,4.623,3.976,1.3275,2.8202,2.3181,4.0707,0.0022,3.7239,4.1716,6.0936,2.1447,1.3618,4.0755,0.0008,2.3423,0.2091,5.0617,4.8609,8.7989,2.6105,1.5981,7.7808,2.2312,3.7341,0.0125,6.3655,3.6868,2.919,5.5929,2.3311,1.4647,3.36,5.9975,0.552,2.7311,2.6285,0.889,4.0209,6.2535,1.4264,5.7861,5.8013,1.5223,4.1603,4.0807,3.8381,2.7286,7.0237,1.1233,1.7285,8.58,3.3292,5.3377,0.2318,5.6117,3.4222,4.6147,1.4217,4.163,5.9618,3.1843,2.559,5.0225,0.808,1.5041,3.3242,2.8778,4.1439,0.2231,4.7698,6.733,2.3902,1.7443,6.1291,2.7142,2.9058,5.2869,2.4062,3.2545,7.7517,0.3306,4.4902,5.0916,0.6511,2.6336,5.9536,0.3446,3.5073,5.5931,1.296,6.1286,3.5834,4.2832,2.1432,6.6837,0.3943,2.708,6.0793,0.2491,6.628,5.0553,1.2138,1.8139,1.6132,1.5012,3.6082,7.5259,8.8312,1.917,0.185,5.6676,4.8833,6.8073,5.9704,8.8359,0.6987,0.3398,1.1092,1.0003,5.7853,5.1645,0.337,6.0708,3.0661,2.3357,0.6014,3.5619,7.9322,0.1461,0.1787,6.5662,6.1692,3.807,0.2582,1.2503,0.7531,0.8525,2.2778,5.0626,4.0792,0.8602,3.7492,0.0501,3.1863,0.0269,1.12,2.7549,0.0513,2.695,8.0125,0.0127,0.1107,0.0191,0.9504,1.2231,7.6926,2.6631,0.0839,2.7178,3.5899,3.4646,2.3702,0.9507,0.7508,0.9494,4.7653,4.9782,5.0849,2.8278,4.8703,2.1913,2.3706,2.0286,4.4884,0.2724,6.3454,2.351,6.967,2.4581,7.7049,9.5772,2.3885,1.4808,2.7738,2.8655,2.8602,3.8323,7.5862,0.3534,2.2686,3.5226,0.5636,2.0935,3.9271,7.8968,1.6952,0.4896,3.7347,8.7331,1.9499,1.5451,6.1775,0.6235,2.2419,2.3861,1.6944,2.1941,4.7074,4.986,2.3245,2.3585,3.1514,3.4733,1.9909,8.438,0.8717,8.1911,0.0933,2.687,2.5769,0.8081,3.4864,2.8491,4.7473,1.4444,7.3544,1.7304,3.8674,3.5066,3.1404,4.7311,3.7072,4.9498,5.7867,5.7145,3.0311,3.9369,1.5394,2.2563,2.2311,1.8632,3.4527,6.1338,1.2059,7.4632,0.8396,0.8816,1.1243,5.3083,0.7415,1.0218,3.0325,2.1103,1.2786,2.1578,1.341,4.2368,3.4798,0.229,4.9163,0.6503,1.2323,6.6542,0.115,2.8884,4.5948,4.6176,2.4591,6.2856,0.001,5.384,6.4113,4.1846,2.301,1.7599,1.0779,6.2416,2.5841,6.3337,0.7056,0.8888,0.5772,0.2845,5.6858,0.3808,3.9097,5.632,0.1478,1.5245,1.2209,4.2139,3.7505,3.5895,0.1902,1.0746,0.049,1.6987,5.5847,1.9049,3.5423,6.9299,4.9989,1.5189,1.6357,3.2824,1.162,7.6925,3.2592,3.1239,5.4971,1.1323,0.0009,1.5004,9.0465,0.824,1.4627,8.1091,0.5675,0.8134,2.3655,2.7255,2.7217,1.334,0.0604,0.0284,1.9487,3.4592,3.6271,0.6998,3.1457,0.9926,2.4738,8.0969,0.2194,0.0011,0.001,0.0004,1.6228,4.0196,1.0081,0.1093,5.3379,1.9199,3.0344,5.2855,5.1735,5.4384,5.4099,8.3527,2.9823,0.509,9.3396,0.0816,2.2646,2.4984,1.2253,3.3226,0.0544,0.6195,0.0268,1.5442,2.759,4.209,0.7341,2.6018,1.9989,0.193,0.0878,1.3923,0.5662,6.7773,1.3469,1.3676,2.3751,4.3373,1.3623,0.9969,3.4471,0.6414,0.4725,3.7518,1.4839,1.9866,5.5646,0.6559,1.2896,0.9503,7.0629,0.0179,1.1786,4.8318,0.069,3.7668,0.0275,0.9477]}

EMI Music called Airi L the \"original version of that track, that was just the way we did it on one of our projects in Dubai\". Although the original version (released as the single) was produced by Rowland and Guetta, a live performance of the song was held where Guetta and Rowland appeared on-stage together to perform the song.\nOn 1 May 2010 it was announced that \"Where The Heart Beats Beat\" was the lead track of British dance music artist Sia's debut album Music of the Spheres. It was released digitally 21 September 2010 along with an extended mix with an additional six minutes of new material, which Sia has termed a 'extended mixed' version of the song. A studio-track version of the song, featuring Guetta as a guest vocalist, was released on 24 September. On 2 October 2010, EMI Music announced the release of a remix album from the collaboration with Guetta and Rowland, called Future Bites. Later that same day, Future World became available on iTunes. The album charted in both the United Kingdom and the U.S., and reached #3 on the UK Albums Chart and #16 on the U.S. Albums Chart. After its release Future Bites and Future World remained exclusive to iTunes for several weeks or until the next single was available.\n\"When I first saw Guetta and Rowland with my producer, I was so inspired. And when they told me that they wanted to produce me, I thought it could only be something amazing,\" Sia said. \"I asked them if they would be part of my album from the start. Of course they said yes. We worked on the first version of it quite quickly\". When they started to record the studio version of the song, Guetta and Rowland said that they thought the song could be in two versions and they wanted to keep the studio version and release it as a single, and to keep this version for the soundtrack of a film that will be released later.","token_len":448,"entropy":[10.1901,2.736,6.1427,11.5372,3.3769,5.474,14.6873,1.5582,8.3924,0.1066,1.971,0.0962,1.7935,1.6826,10.3051,7.3087,3.7985,1.9112,7.4339,1.7646,0.9019,1.1088,9.9974,6.4834,4.9801,9.5587,3.7697,8.4296,1.7232,4.3539,0.3415,1.0672,0.1732,0.5263,8.4119,2.0692,4.855,6.1558,4.7488,0.0024,1.4519,2.0571,0.7843,4.9596,3.9012,1.3714,5.1619,3.8936,2.5984,5.0024,2.0644,4.2301,3.2987,3.8537,3.2058,3.5193,0.076,4.4145,6.1312,1.6921,0.7344,5.6267,3.5343,7.8904,2.9682,6.0732,1.3092,2.4672,1.0438,4.9788,3.9446,3.2841,2.6133,5.3814,3.0592,0.9282,5.0902,0.9362,5.3078,0.0072,1.5785,5.8729,0.0069,0.8038,3.7738,4.1622,4.3539,0.9911,0.575,0.6956,0.8424,2.7855,7.3008,3.8777,0.0022,1.0995,1.1404,0.0041,4.9691,1.9586,5.7453,0.1478,2.4904,2.9908,1.487,1.0439,0.6212,0.6978,1.165,9.8449,3.8759,1.0881,0.6451,5.7791,0.0937,0.7312,0.1952,5.1775,9.2391,4.2409,3.8306,4.483,7.6926,1.216,1.4557,2.0395,5.9504,1.9386,1.9118,8.7583,1.2495,0.0617,2.1276,7.3643,3.5401,1.9072,2.8791,0.4179,8.0192,2.817,0.8139,7.144,1.2846,0.8363,2.4196,0.5246,1.8435,4.9647,10.3383,3.4149,0.4608,5.2868,0.0087,3.05,3.4535,5.6401,4.4729,3.2941,2.5243,4.9357,3.0535,0.3105,3.6776,1.0709,2.7158,2.8219,5.5961,0.0058,4.1739,8.0402,3.4752,4.0647,8.2054,0.5065,5.7717,2.6949,1.1174,0.4162,0.3841,0.9823,0.5362,4.0121,6.9146,5.491,7.1965,0.6848,0.5592,0.2428,0.7235,2.9483,3.9704,3.5725,0.0091,3.8375,2.0268,0.7077,1.6047,0.0043,0.5945,0.2918,0.6386,0.8128,3.3891,1.164,3.6509,3.3965,2.887,1.7525,0.9183,1.2469,4.1455,0.0069,0.5449,1.6874,2.0671,0.6072,0.092,1.5967,2.7277,4.1089,4.758,1.1876,4.2612,2.1804,2.5872,0.0021,0.7342,0.3466,0.0073,1.7644,3.0105,5.9292,6.0002,3.7004,1.2255,6.036,0.6392,0.8575,1.0599,0.3627,4.9961,8.444,6.5167,2.225,1.3707,2.27,1.3866,2.3323,2.4737,7.0858,0.9501,2.8369,5.7043,1.4764,3.3653,1.0366,0.254,0.7712,2.4015,0.001,0.1214,1.8863,1.7763,4.1313,1.8975,2.7506,0.2717,0.2274,1.2591,4.7576,1.029,0.8951,2.3384,0.8226,4.195,0.1548,0.1754,0.8462,0.001,0.1957,0.0576,1.386,0.3046,0.1234,0.4545,5.1868,2.7871,0.5,9.1928,3.1393,0.0013,5.0656,1.1588,0.115,5.2841,6.2085,0.55,2.5907,1.7956,3.4394,1.2034,7.0036,3.1904,1.6159,5.5752,5.2787,1.2933,4.9377,1.068,0.7802,5.0598,4.0651,1.2347,1.4405,2.306,6.5229,0.0095,0.4526,0.0627,0.0066,5.8786,2.7392,5.8905,1.4631,1.5711,1.4026,2.7323,4.7246,2.0818,3.8035,2.4369,2.319,4.4257,0.0672,1.3097,1.4038,2.2356,0.4308,4.6041,5.9149,1.9931,0.349,2.6569,2.4783,4.9964,3.9163,0.2977,6.116,4.4272,2.9175,3.8816,0.0342,1.4295,0.4121,0.274,1.405,5.4061,0.953,1.1413,0.7905,1.8721,1.963,6.5619,0.002,2.2729,3.4421,7.2049,1.8862,1.8045,1.238,5.2937,0.0269,1.3473,1.0137,0.8578,1.1507,3.412,3.9918,1.6614,1.5945,3.2139,3.3767,1.3937,2.7248,6.805,2.6359,7.7926,5.1035,4.1971,4.1899,2.1687,4.0149,1.3238,5.7477,0.7197,1.4692,0.4619,0.5246,0.7212,3.4626,0.0032,0.287,0.0199,0.0033,4.5794,1.4681,0.9092,3.9139,2.2633,1.6443,2.9964,0.5557,5.7596,4.9364,2.1598,2.6493,2.8769,1.5722,0.2804,3.9711,1.3557,5.3892,0.2559,4.382,3.3517,0.6629,1.7062,0.9147,1.0326,2.5907,3.3781,3.8829,2.4989,5.4564,3.2596,4.3384,1.9907,6.3899,3.0416,3.3662,3.4595,3.5003,3.5629,0.4641,0.928,1.61,2.186]}
{"prompt":"The game received generally positive reviews with a normalized rating of 80 out of 100 based on 90 reviews on Metacritic . GameRankings assigned a rating of 81 % based on 61 reviews . The","text":"The game received generally positive reviews with a normalized rating of 80 out of 100 based on 90 reviews on Metacritic. GameRankings assigned a rating of 81 % based on 61 reviews. The main criticisms of the book were its inefficacy and that the game was missing all main game elements (e.g. progression, progression rewards, game completion, unlockable content and customization features) and instead featured mostly point-and-click puzzles and was short.\nFollowing the launch of the game, a new expansion called The Maze of Shadows was released in April 2009. The Maze of Shadows consists of five chapters with a total of twelve puzzles.\nThe game is a point-and-click adventure. Its puzzles often involve clicking on an object that appears on the screen, and by moving this object and clicking on the object it moves, a new object that can be used. The object will then appear in another location; this can be either randomly chosen or determined by an inventory system. Once an object is moved, it cannot be moved again until it is moved somewhere else.\n\nReception\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed for its excellent puzzles. Review aggregator Metacritic gave this game a score of 92\/100 based on 35 reviews. A few of the reviews praised the puzzles and wrote, \"Often moving from room to room a player will come across objects in need of be clicked on by the player. Some of these objects are meant to move, and in turn provide additional moving objects that have many different possible purposes.\" Reviewer Jeremy Rubin gave the game a score of 96 and wrote, \"That game seemed like a worthy successor, and now The Maze of Shadows looks to follow in its footsteps.\"\nA few of the reviews praised the dialogue system, and wrote, \"Superb dialogue that is varied, and will be sure to amuse the reader\". Other reviewers noted the use of objects and said, \"The puzzles are not very difficult to solve just on sight, but for the less-inclined this could prove tricky.\"\nThe Maze of Shadows received generally positive feedback. GameSpot gave the game an eight out of ten for the puzzles and five out of ten for the rest of the game.","token_len":448,"entropy":[6.8795,7.1249,8.2055,0.7588,0.0692,4.9967,2.5635,12.7169,1.688,0.1963,4.6653,2.2156,0.0014,0.1049,4.1942,0.0418,7.6143,1.9411,4.1829,5.3924,0.0191,0.0,0.608,5.5207,4.7809,0.2852,8.178,1.5818,2.4988,0.2644,4.3833,10.9209,2.3221,0.0068,6.7662,0.0791,1.6498,2.1261,6.2712,5.0956,1.1125,0.4066,7.1941,0.8599,2.3521,6.8554,6.031,1.5819,1.007,6.0926,1.5869,1.814,1.242,6.4875,5.0103,6.768,4.4366,1.2825,3.2718,2.6874,0.0038,0.0003,0.7119,6.8879,0.8374,4.715,4.4721,0.505,5.2865,6.7082,1.663,6.7794,1.0656,3.8096,2.775,5.3814,4.6652,1.6241,1.2301,5.5425,5.4524,6.0453,8.2353,0.8406,0.7346,0.0012,0.0016,3.4145,1.9728,4.794,5.3183,2.6429,1.5432,13.0945,0.9336,3.572,0.1897,0.5381,0.4448,0.6957,3.2869,2.993,5.9538,2.7473,2.2371,6.4868,1.23,5.6338,0.798,0.5316,2.8493,3.111,3.8439,0.7236,1.0172,1.6414,0.3081,0.0161,6.0742,0.0644,3.1957,2.5908,3.1198,2.1601,0.7749,0.1509,5.4811,4.3822,1.0916,2.6389,3.5334,1.5399,2.3638,2.3505,6.1081,0.0968,0.0107,0.0005,0.0005,0.9909,4.0521,5.644,3.5841,6.6272,1.5983,6.5247,1.2514,3.1756,1.0541,3.2199,2.7922,1.6729,0.9224,0.1752,1.6888,2.3446,5.7875,3.9142,4.5556,0.1074,4.3826,2.2499,1.1233,1.3874,1.7652,1.9496,3.0809,2.5544,3.4518,4.3219,2.5043,4.5973,3.598,0.2547,2.9488,4.3507,1.2284,4.3687,3.2406,2.2476,1.2096,1.2852,5.2248,2.0627,6.0948,2.561,2.9618,0.4892,3.3071,5.7966,4.0957,1.1054,6.5694,0.387,4.4454,6.4611,3.035,0.5328,4.3726,3.5239,0.2105,0.7732,3.9077,0.6845,0.8432,4.5466,0.1748,1.3364,0.6424,1.7367,1.1454,0.6686,3.1878,5.97,0.1364,0.5588,1.4088,7.1058,6.8479,0.9614,0.5691,0.0005,1.4189,1.1036,2.1021,6.2154,1.2876,2.5419,0.2048,5.0539,3.0151,1.9242,5.623,5.5914,0.3216,3.4884,0.0048,0.0004,2.5205,5.0203,0.2806,0.7171,1.5874,0.0445,3.8745,4.1227,0.0124,2.2509,0.0051,5.8107,0.095,0.8803,3.7904,3.7982,3.8975,0.3049,1.214,2.7281,0.3042,2.9451,1.698,5.5934,2.6206,0.0821,9.6245,6.8789,5.4166,3.8387,0.022,0.0019,5.8283,3.3416,1.478,4.4523,0.3914,4.2113,3.3335,5.1701,0.025,7.1386,7.0476,1.1419,3.8603,1.6594,0.6116,1.4535,4.2238,1.4144,1.2979,0.5569,1.4581,6.6686,0.3189,5.1156,2.4871,2.3062,4.2691,5.3925,5.3429,3.9177,6.8914,4.9062,2.398,4.2095,6.3881,2.1472,4.2786,6.4423,1.8994,6.1299,2.7616,6.4734,7.5428,3.7697,0.7314,0.0679,0.2492,0.6847,0.0146,3.6884,4.7209,1.8093,0.1089,0.0301,6.8002,2.8471,6.5586,2.5096,0.8267,6.7602,1.9022,3.9704,1.7463,5.6184,6.3469,0.0404,0.0625,0.0027,3.5909,1.9057,5.6538,1.8791,2.0361,0.1861,1.1615,0.8348,13.827,2.7041,2.2192,0.065,0.8861,1.4808,0.1821,8.1093,3.1246,1.4218,2.3058,1.5986,0.107,0.0219,8.5517,2.7404,0.9036,3.9252,2.1931,7.247,2.1665,2.3108,5.76,2.5753,5.0281,0.0104,5.5125,2.7719,4.4237,5.6156,4.3933,0.6833,2.9992,1.3885,4.4151,0.0022,7.1494,1.8057,6.3888,1.2834,0.0278,1.6519,2.2116,1.2603,4.0434,3.9343,2.4211,1.3694,1.3193,7.1313,5.3509,5.0783,0.6755,1.2155,5.2079,1.5425,6.9823,3.6054,5.6758,1.2311,0.0016,7.1042,3.7647,3.9627,6.412,1.6499,0.8908,11.4598,1.1717,0.0201,0.0019,2.1044,4.8067,0.3136,5.3955,1.5819,2.9995,2.4905,1.5923,0.7754,0.036,3.1219,5.9225,0.3299,0.001,1.2729,3.8899,2.9767,3.4095,1.5213,6.2553,0.4415,0.0022,0.2258,0.0925,0.2028,7.1216,0.3208,0.0552,0.6144,0.4274]}

Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus. In 1993, they performed \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"I'm Only Sleeping\" on the Rock &  Roll Hall Of Fame \/ Billboard Rock &  Roll Hall Of Fame Hits Tour.\nMusically, the band is described as a blend of progressive rock, blue wave music, fusion and hard rock, using a large palette of harmonies and melodies. The band often features keyboards, synthesizers and violin arrangements. The band has released a diverse, highly acclaimed catalogue of 13 studio albums and several compilation albums. The 1990s saw the band take steps to develop their sound through an adventurous use of electronics and a progressive-psychedelic bent.\nIn 2003, an independent compilation CD titled '20\/20' was released. It featured many of the band's greatest hits, plus several of their earlier and lesser-known recordings. This CD was followed by a re-issued, two-CD version of their 1991 debut album, 'Sacred Hearts' (also known as '172') in 2005. The re-issue featured all their studio material through 1992. That same year, the band entered a five-year masterworks contract with Sire Records. Their first major-label release was 2005's 'Open Up, Close Up'.\nIn 2006, the band released an album called The Next Day, a live album. The album was released on July 10, 2006.\nOn September 13, 2010, it was announced on their website, that Mike Portnoy, known for working with the Rage Against the Machine and the Phish, would be going on tour as a solo artist.

{"prompt":"The character of Walter Skinner had evolved over the course of The X @ - @ Files ' sixth season . At the start of season six , however , the producers and writers felt","text":"The character of Walter Skinner had evolved over the course of The X @ - @ Files'sixth season. At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt it to be necessary to replace Walter Skinner after the character had been \" consistently and consistently disappointing for the past two seasons. \" As of Season Five, Walter Skinner appeared on six of the 13 episodes where he was on screen. The role was reprised on the season six finale of The X @ - @ Files.\nAlthough there is a possibility that his replacement, the Professor, was merely used as a device to introduce the seventh season, it is more than likely that his replacement is much more permanent than Walter Skinner once had been. From the time he was introduced on the season two episode, \" The Big Worm, \" it was clear that it would be the Professor who would have long term responsibility for dealing with those who were dealing with the \" monster that haunts Earth. \" As such, it was obvious that his replacement had to be a new character, one with a very different background from that of Walter Skinner. Although the character was first introduced on the season six episode, \"Secret Agent : The Hidden Side \", all indications point to the fact that the Professor's role will continue well beyond The X @ - @ Files' seventh season.\nIn fact, the producers of The X @ - @ Files have announced a commitment to continue developing the character. Since his debut on the show, the character of the Professor has come to symbolize the larger than life mystery that lay behind the many of the things that were happening on the X @ - @ Files. Whether or not his arrival on the show helped to spark a new era in the way that the network treated its superhero character, it is certainly the case that the character who has now become synonymous with the show has left a lasting impression on our society and the way in which we interpret the world around us. His return would obviously be an important part of his continuing legacy.\nWhatever is to happen to Walter Skinner and the Professor is yet to be announced. One thing is for certain, that is that Walter Skinner is not to be seen on the seventh season of The X @ - @ Files.","token_len":449,"entropy":[7.9901,1.8201,7.145,5.3255,5.0157,5.6325,1.879,0.9531,1.2001,0.0007,5.3306,5.3404,16.5925,6.7158,4.8404,11.0714,6.9434,16.6217,6.5567,4.6437,1.1009,4.7403,0.9104,2.7227,0.1129,2.1626,3.4132,0.4051,4.8113,0.0036,1.7523,6.5487,4.1694,1.9794,3.8721,2.6095,7.1145,0.0926,3.9828,0.2808,5.6298,2.8534,1.6617,5.3815,1.6899,3.87,1.8526,1.1171,4.9735,16.0848,3.2823,2.0377,7.3811,2.4634,1.5544,4.2337,2.1638,0.2395,2.2525,3.0722,3.6018,3.9603,2.7749,4.1043,0.2481,2.0776,0.5566,4.9762,2.4091,4.2121,2.6044,0.7329,3.2207,0.3852,5.2523,0.6293,1.2663,3.5137,2.74,0.9684,2.5321,6.6545,1.8282,6.2946,0.003,2.4039,2.0019,4.1738,2.0673,0.6294,1.3872,1.6473,0.5028,0.2437,0.158,0.0141,0.1304,0.9746,1.375,12.2526,3.5918,2.0711,1.8575,4.416,0.3362,5.2408,4.1065,3.4702,3.7223,7.348,1.174,2.8498,5.9059,5.2502,1.5934,0.4534,6.9424,0.624,6.2206,1.638,9.211,1.199,1.4359,1.6908,0.7826,4.8042,4.8473,0.2934,0.249,3.4731,1.1425,3.1237,4.491,0.3484,6.2522,2.6005,1.3782,0.1545,6.8671,4.0605,0.2107,0.3111,6.3273,1.2295,3.8131,1.78,1.367,0.9538,2.1047,1.0801,4.2947,3.1379,2.0423,2.0838,2.9128,2.3739,5.2262,10.1839,4.4906,2.3562,3.292,1.3092,0.9492,0.3753,4.6728,1.6715,0.5111,3.3266,2.7795,1.2943,0.5192,3.176,6.702,5.8507,5.8772,0.284,5.7989,0.0101,5.7336,1.1926,2.0836,4.7503,0.0152,1.5,4.4046,7.8389,3.9069,5.2384,0.0003,4.5926,2.2887,3.467,3.5188,3.3246,0.0803,1.5724,1.2855,4.0245,0.4022,3.5427,0.926,3.6865,1.2172,0.3585,1.7855,4.0063,1.2911,1.814,1.9709,2.5064,1.138,3.8869,0.5674,4.1514,2.2879,2.1005,0.4364,0.84,0.1058,0.5013,4.9997,1.9762,2.5778,2.2522,5.4422,0.5136,1.1824,0.5464,1.7928,2.7275,0.3514,0.9355,1.448,11.4548,2.3709,7.614,1.8441,6.4767,5.3242,4.7661,5.8949,4.7085,2.3408,0.2707,1.5646,2.8439,0.0242,1.677,0.9157,2.6737,1.3374,3.4833,2.5794,6.0608,3.6758,3.8421,0.2677,0.0711,0.0333,0.0032,0.0284,2.8052,4.1046,0.2037,0.2826,0.978,2.869,4.248,0.0253,1.8661,6.0541,3.2448,1.1608,0.0497,0.0116,0.0045,0.0025,0.0082,2.5385,5.603,2.9767,6.7371,0.2496,3.8787,3.9855,1.5312,0.8894,2.5147,5.4776,4.0895,3.098,0.8182,0.6912,1.2959,1.2228,2.0129,0.9717,3.2276,2.7463,0.2866,0.1839,4.7441,0.8258,4.3245,0.1001,0.8998,6.923,7.229,0.0328,7.4154,1.9159,8.4701,1.8103,0.9567,5.8195,4.9687,0.5488,5.6143,0.3849,3.9216,4.4913,1.664,1.342,2.9083,0.088,0.0333,0.0033,0.0203,2.0136,5.1598,1.2015,0.0018,3.233,5.1254,1.2217,0.4443,0.3283,5.9869,1.8792,4.7674,1.5784,1.6264,3.0971,1.6823,0.926,5.8095,0.7625,1.8361,7.6818,5.3755,2.8368,6.0958,4.5033,1.6253,1.8226,1.1901,3.6869,4.2075,1.5172,0.0358,1.7352,1.7727,5.3389,2.3617,4.74,1.6937,3.7759,0.0235,0.7976,1.7184,1.5497,5.5284,1.1703,0.9151,1.2271,0.3597,4.8118,3.7555,1.9418,1.838,2.6958,2.0089,0.0008,1.6036,5.5477,1.3454,2.5893,1.2737,0.1657,0.1065,6.0412,2.8731,4.3405,6.126,1.7929,2.8374,1.2043,2.1163,0.0326,5.1286,3.7399,1.0821,1.647,0.8946,6.7592,4.9959,3.9946,3.4291,2.2869,0.8099,0.022,3.0985,1.2653,1.2015,3.7673,2.9362,0.0973,0.034,3.5447,0.4343,5.711,1.0127,0.7408,1.5999,0.568,1.2456,2.9193,4.8427,0.903,2.3509,0.0187,1.5716,2.1671,4.7241,0.1523,4.4166,2.5889,1.1873,7.4368,0.2445,0.8419,0.4308,0.0043,0.0032,0.0022,0.0032,0.0051,0.8045]}
{"prompt":"The toponymy of Oldham seems to imply `` old village or place `` from < unk > ( Saxon ) signifying < unk > or antiquity , and Ham ( Saxon ) a house ,","text":"The toponymy of Oldham seems to imply `` old village or place `` from < unk > ( Saxon ) signifying < unk > or antiquity, and Ham ( Saxon ) a house, but the village did not become a hamlet in the Middle Ages until about 1250 ( see Historical ) with the growth of industry and the associated population, although the name may have lain dormant for a long time earlier. The name originates in a Saxon cognomen, Haman, but was known for centuries as Manum. In the Middle Ages, Oldham was known as the Hamlet of Garters, the name of a cottage, possibly derived from the local stone quarry. Oldham became a village on 1 November 1253 ( by charter for its people from the Bishop of Lincoln, who granted the village their liberties and privileges ), hence the date is referred to by historians as the year of ( Oldham ), and from that point is the usual date for the origin of the village. ( From William Dunham, an Oldham writer. )\nThe history of Oldham, which is told in the first few pages of the Oldham Vicarage Records, is a brief but interesting account of the villages life by the mid eighteenth century. Before the Conquest, there has been little evidence of human settlement in the area to the north of the city. The Romans, however, extended their influence over a long distance and left behind not only a monumental remains, but their own names to denote the many sites they had occupied or the rivers and streams in the area.\nThere are no Roman buildings at Oldham, but Roman roads or traces of them exist in the neighbourhood. The river Colne is believed to have been a Roman mile-stone, and the name Oldham means `` river Colne ''. Several Roman Iron Age sites, known as Iron Age graves, are located in South Oldham, including the large hillfort of Blythewood. The Iron Age settlement is also documented at North Oldham, and it is interesting to note that a site of this period is also to be found at the very edge of modern day Oldham, on the edge of the Chilkeston moorland.","token_len":449,"entropy":[6.6897,17.3713,3.4021,2.7599,8.2219,3.5836,6.9695,0.3671,7.1352,12.0156,11.4325,9.1293,4.1176,5.5215,3.511,5.5732,9.721,9.0886,6.2519,5.1956,3.9982,12.0947,0.3736,3.2544,9.7947,2.2114,5.5396,1.6849,0.0371,0.1293,3.0056,10.7204,1.9207,1.8636,9.4253,6.0852,4.749,0.1497,0.0695,5.4988,6.1828,2.7,4.2904,2.4959,5.5721,7.2822,0.0542,3.5516,1.6643,5.3141,3.3346,3.4119,1.2968,3.8766,0.0162,2.1028,3.0315,3.8378,1.6591,3.3455,5.3976,7.6517,9.082,5.2089,1.002,6.4419,0.0515,8.2468,1.0249,1.8981,8.133,4.1298,3.3314,4.8454,1.6338,3.8907,3.6843,0.5542,8.2336,0.5711,3.3587,1.3416,1.7775,0.9279,0.0859,9.0929,0.7055,1.7766,2.6883,6.0486,0.006,2.1006,2.9779,5.5031,0.0514,7.6969,3.7859,1.8003,4.0759,4.8725,1.5635,2.8851,3.8769,6.405,3.8784,4.1385,2.434,7.7445,4.1595,2.9356,2.8747,1.4463,2.362,0.0152,1.0093,5.2724,0.0139,0.9791,3.2339,0.5425,1.8964,4.2834,3.0846,0.2794,5.4936,10.7501,1.4238,2.7403,2.7844,1.304,1.3355,7.8616,2.7031,6.514,3.5033,0.048,0.7228,5.5674,7.906,4.1576,1.7832,3.8858,0.0342,3.6955,1.5018,2.9273,3.6474,5.3617,3.7516,3.1741,3.9372,2.4008,6.4352,10.2697,5.3249,5.5151,4.413,3.5247,1.3131,5.4504,0.3599,6.4744,2.3594,2.9934,4.9657,1.6945,3.3685,5.7384,7.6006,2.165,2.7416,3.2108,6.3798,0.8057,5.5946,3.4189,7.6313,0.0405,2.9499,5.7727,0.2778,1.2994,3.8749,1.0165,7.4041,4.8412,0.0275,3.5083,2.322,4.4459,2.6551,2.9783,5.0813,3.1455,6.9765,1.1382,1.3463,1.0944,5.8103,0.0922,1.0289,1.7549,0.6505,4.0956,5.648,5.5722,8.004,1.3168,6.8531,4.4169,0.03,5.0458,3.3003,4.1844,1.9241,3.1364,5.9213,0.1103,0.5875,0.0027,2.9461,2.9245,1.6716,5.0072,0.7603,1.3552,4.1656,3.2843,1.5283,0.3752,1.3147,4.8935,0.2287,11.6578,0.3285,2.6396,8.9309,0.7466,1.1942,3.3903,5.0898,2.8404,2.2604,1.7397,0.2223,0.7431,6.8339,7.0114,5.4771,1.6888,4.9459,6.5579,0.0493,0.7041,6.4974,1.0446,6.7137,1.129,2.7552,6.5706,0.0989,2.1807,3.3079,0.8078,6.1003,1.5313,0.6995,1.3102,2.9751,6.4386,2.3407,1.2813,0.6461,1.0244,2.8712,1.0877,1.5655,6.6998,2.1168,2.0942,0.0153,6.7466,1.0669,3.1319,3.2086,5.0269,2.1854,4.806,2.5812,6.6657,4.2176,6.7285,0.4056,2.3171,8.674,5.6226,1.8549,0.1555,5.6875,1.2545,6.9064,4.6525,4.7369,1.2838,6.0842,5.7668,2.9576,1.8043,2.8955,4.8176,4.0117,8.3936,1.9748,1.8017,3.8748,1.995,1.392,0.7081,3.2404,3.8672,1.1342,3.2492,5.0921,5.309,3.3593,0.1294,0.0007,0.9618,1.3062,5.8631,5.6166,5.3113,8.0709,0.1769,3.5039,3.9592,1.5877,1.262,3.6484,1.1065,1.3837,5.6684,7.2107,3.2415,2.0813,4.8876,0.0475,0.2674,0.855,2.5442,2.3259,7.1013,1.9194,5.6763,1.3832,1.5547,1.5925,4.4662,1.6165,0.0267,4.4401,4.6476,3.1046,6.9253,0.1298,5.3885,3.91,5.764,1.792,11.1339,1.8402,2.4728,2.3777,4.925,0.6888,5.7548,2.7786,6.4366,0.5367,1.3589,2.3546,1.1749,7.2496,2.2443,0.0065,1.3078,3.0225,1.1966,6.345,6.0798,7.7794,1.6548,4.6855,5.0021,1.4357,6.9005,1.8406,1.67,4.9423,0.0201,4.423,2.5442,3.5472,6.8578,2.9177,5.724,0.4039,0.0007,0.8497,2.2612,2.9803,0.6252,4.7044,0.4006,0.1778,0.3188,3.6957,5.1433,2.4645,2.2199,4.9557,1.6975,3.4667,6.0351,0.1411,0.1288,1.0944,1.8212,5.297,2.7633,0.0064,7.9247,5.6296,1.1641,0.0054,1.4291,3.1086,0.3856,3.1021,0.0214,0.974,6.239,7.4894,6.5803,7.2775,1.2167,1.8365,0.8181]}

The Tigers gained a first down with the first play of the quarter when a touchdown was returned to Clemson. A two-point conversion and a two-yard touchdown run by LSU QB Tyree Lewis brought the Tigers to the 13 - 7 lead.\nClemson answered with a 44 @ - @ yard touchdown pass by senior wideout Jeff McDaniel to senior cornerback Joe Burrow, bringing LSU to 14 - 7. Another two-point conversion and a two-yard rush by junior wide receiver Devin Funchess gave Clemson the 20 - 7 lead. At the three-minute warning, freshman wide receiver Isaiah Wynn hit senior cornerback Jeff Fainter for a 15-yard score to give the Tigers an 18-point lead. Clemson finished the half by outgaining LSU by 18 - 5.\nClemson scored the game-sealing touchdown when senior cornerback Brandon Davis picked off a pass thrown to quarterback Tyree Lewis before he had a chance to pass it to a teammate. Following the catch by Davis, senior wide receiver Jeff McDaniel broke free with a 5-yard rush for the Tigers \u2018 second score. Senior offensive lineman Jermal Lynch completed passes for 50 and 24 yards. All three Clemson touchdowns were field goals.\nFollowing what seemed like a poor performance overall by Clemson\u2019s offensive line, senior offensive lineman Jermal Lynch stepped up and completed two field goals of 44, 38 and 52 yards respectively to give Clemson a 31 - 7 lead. Senior quarterback Tyree Lewis completed one of his two passes for 23 yards before leaving the game.\nLake Murray is located about 20 miles west of Houston, Texas and in the Brazos River Basin of Texas.

There are eight reservoirs that make up the lake including La Plata, Lake Lick, Lake Homosassa, Lake Huron, Lake Mary, Lake Viera, Lake LaBonte and Lake Houston.","token_len":450,"entropy":[6.7499,6.1187,5.4705,0.6538,7.7379,4.6446,4.8975,0.3572,1.0647,1.6991,2.3627,6.8779,5.4202,2.2087,6.7163,2.4255,4.8298,6.4638,15.6262,7.5886,8.4957,7.2959,0.911,0.4455,1.9581,0.9929,5.9616,3.126,2.7816,0.0566,3.4154,3.0344,3.1129,3.0657,0.729,0.0656,2.6602,4.8727,3.2675,5.0685,2.7753,2.9843,1.6144,1.7858,2.165,4.221,4.9574,0.3387,1.2759,0.0741,4.1793,0.9982,3.467,0.1012,1.8655,2.1252,3.0005,1.0761,5.6433,5.0122,4.3577,2.8417,5.4071,4.5501,0.8158,0.7401,1.2274,2.6919,5.4118,5.9067,3.6979,1.0933,0.5957,1.8083,12.7267,0.0001,6.383,0.49,0.5864,5.871,7.9782,0.1353,0.4777,2.2217,5.0887,1.8367,2.3711,5.2403,3.4083,1.472,6.3684,5.7972,3.8487,2.2236,2.9773,3.1034,5.7525,6.6127,4.0448,2.9685,6.0784,6.5499,0.7331,4.314,0.2884,1.7412,0.5315,6.4206,1.9296,0.2987,0.1071,0.1238,2.1672,0.5191,1.3142,0.0532,0.0254,8.5242,0.4393,1.8614,2.0177,1.7613,5.4306,4.2669,0.0014,0.0001,3.3868,1.7243,0.8498,6.7209,0.4382,2.1963,0.7005,0.2903,5.4815,0.701,5.4157,0.4523,1.8304,3.9817,1.5209,5.2304,1.1305,1.2004,5.7878,5.172,0.0131,4.4264,4.9583,2.6068,5.3399,6.2871,5.6046,4.2967,1.3062,0.2704,4.1214,1.2143,0.023,3.1952,2.8017,1.5636,1.3798,0.0605,2.951,1.0124,1.4464,5.2035,0.2859,0.5383,2.4863,4.479,0.7472,2.9231,3.7767,5.1514,3.692,0.0789,1.9876,2.6416,3.659,0.6316,2.6671,0.5397,0.5646,1.1647,0.0001,4.3888,2.8069,3.1282,1.1176,4.7985,0.0605,1.0494,4.5356,2.5483,2.9095,4.2736,4.6129,4.7178,0.7758,0.9129,1.2832,3.5206,2.156,6.1711,4.0224,0.4546,0.0702,5.1146,4.0498,3.5676,1.5116,0.5375,0.0402,4.7101,2.3581,1.2326,5.153,3.4366,0.5841,6.4975,0.6359,3.2357,4.2256,2.995,0.0811,2.5447,0.6024,0.5358,4.5835,1.3364,0.0034,4.3426,2.4637,2.9537,0.9033,4.8252,0.3666,0.0026,6.8818,2.6638,1.4563,0.636,15.5661,7.1113,6.8678,3.1241,3.2994,4.1801,4.7392,0.6065,5.6613,6.6947,12.4333,4.4262,5.9596,1.4678,7.792,4.2714,5.1062,0.0659,2.2429,5.9723,1.0276,2.9375,2.62,2.1678,7.0768,0.1403,0.875,0.7527,6.0961,7.9899,2.8896,0.3217,0.5146,5.7817,2.5393,6.9754,1.4688,0.9881,9.9209,6.5962,4.8725,2.1622,0.0988,0.2614,2.8349,2.4577,0.6392,3.9726,0.4891,0.0491,5.4899,0.6394,1.7606,3.6396,2.9317,4.953,0.136,3.974,6.6688,2.5444,4.6027,0.5136,6.5676,0.0445,4.9009,1.7269,1.5645,0.8871,0.88,3.5941,0.6991,3.4909,0.4422,0.3284,2.6008,3.2134,3.2202,0.0363,0.0083,3.0215,4.0158,1.3111,1.6308,1.9272,1.4085,0.6816,4.3561,0.066,4.9159,4.9953,0.4464,0.4855,1.1369,1.0831,10.5317,10.6105,4.9359,8.2831,3.431,2.9165,0.8673,2.408,0.01,5.0568,0.8155,0.3409,2.2697,5.291,0.5682,6.166,0.074,1.206,2.8504,3.2295,1.8519,0.3998,2.5153,3.5752,2.6597,1.9304,1.515,6.8239,0.0669,0.0347,0.0334,1.4901,4.2435,0.6067,2.3746,4.6543,3.1207,0.889,0.7746,5.2676,3.4764,8.3871,8.4094,2.2205,4.2322,0.2917,1.9818,0.595,1.1164,8.0524,1.9189,2.0619,3.2633,0.0041,5.6687,4.7957,2.089,1.9711,4.4229,1.3798,0.8003,4.2597,0.005,0.2219,2.3478,5.627,7.0194,1.9865,4.8984,0.4785,5.1787,1.5252,3.0599,4.8428,0.0094,0.9667,2.156,4.8853,7.2164,3.9819,0.0088,1.2206,2.4733,5.9172,3.8765,1.5975,0.5872,9.7052,7.0001,7.0471,0.4369,0.4851,0.3964,4.7533,0.0054,0.5213,0.3526,5.8471,0.7191,0.2948,6.0663,4.0334,0.5309,0.3219,5.075,10.1599,4.0433,1.1422,0.1987,6.7438,0.1682]}
{"prompt":"Real Madrid gained entry to the competition as champions , after they won the 1979 \u2013 80 La Liga . Their opponents in the first round were Irish champions Limerick . Limerick took the lead","text":"Real Madrid gained entry to the competition as champions, after they won the 1979 \u2013 80 La Liga. Their opponents in the first round were Irish champions Limerick. Limerick took the lead in the first half in spite of an early header from Real, a good header into the goal from Dempsey on a corner. After midway there were a few chances, most notably from Alan Sheehan in Limerick\u2019s half. Real took the lead again on the 59th minute, though the ref showed, that the ball had broken against the ball and was on goal. As it turned out the ref had correctly watched the situation. Real\u2019s third came on the 75th minute through a header from Franco, the winner. Limerick tried though to keep up the pressure but could not break through Real\u2019s midfield.\nNext round Real faced Italian champions Sampdoria in the quarterfinal, drawing the game to a deadlock after the first half. In the second half Real took the lead when Franco headed the ball into goal with a header into the corner from a corner. It looked like a winner at half time but, like the game against Limerick it looked as if a goal had been scored but the ref did not see it. Sampdoria had a few chances too. The referee once more had some troubles with his linesmen which may account for the lack of goal that appeared to have been scored on the 80th minute. He may have gone to the replay. The game ended 3 \u2013 3, but that would have been the end of the game. A few minutes later he introduced the player off the bench, Michel Redondo, a Spanish born player, as the substitute. Redondo went on to become and the star of the tournament, scoring two goals in the following round in two of the four games to be played. Real drew the game in Limerick to a deadlock, though still in the first round, and played a hard fought game against the Dutch champions Ajax. Ajax took the lead on the second half, though Real took the lead at the end of the first half, again on Franco. The same player as the final goal against Limerick. Ajax tried to tie the game up but could not.","token_len":451,"entropy":[10.3814,9.927,6.5198,0.7236,0.2932,4.3914,3.3772,5.3717,2.3537,4.2752,4.3273,1.925,0.7209,9.3218,9.3425,2.216,3.5645,0.0106,4.085,4.3142,4.8268,3.6756,1.0792,4.4724,0.74,1.085,12.3761,2.4355,6.7749,0.005,2.1248,7.1663,0.0011,4.0554,1.0397,2.2482,1.5582,0.2858,3.3187,0.6762,4.519,6.8028,0.048,3.1306,1.7971,4.7484,0.9752,6.6137,4.9945,4.4478,5.6745,4.5009,6.6307,0.1073,4.7755,1.7136,10.1369,4.8154,2.6356,3.2111,1.544,3.878,10.4891,11.4461,1.6916,2.5291,1.3174,3.2966,2.1433,5.9738,2.8745,1.6354,5.9766,2.5974,8.8585,0.1234,2.9144,10.3101,0.0009,18.3349,7.6931,4.0927,2.3468,1.0686,3.2644,3.1901,0.7403,0.1504,2.7579,3.2862,1.0245,10.0313,0.0932,0.0439,1.324,4.4711,2.5244,7.4768,6.8013,7.2951,5.6265,2.0137,1.7984,1.8668,6.6026,6.5564,0.6003,4.4432,4.0872,2.2355,4.4128,4.0459,0.8,4.547,2.8918,1.7403,0.0509,2.7917,4.7383,1.4015,5.7171,7.4877,0.5855,6.6017,2.8348,2.5393,10.784,0.2484,0.3313,5.5047,4.8485,1.5382,0.6206,3.9615,0.01,0.154,7.2518,1.7409,2.8371,0.4755,9.6306,3.4778,3.5073,4.359,2.4128,3.8781,0.0002,6.2028,10.1972,1.426,3.9926,3.5409,1.1715,1.0673,2.3665,3.9882,0.3958,3.8303,1.2399,6.0608,5.2331,0.0063,0.0335,4.5127,0.6101,2.8575,9.8491,4.9377,4.2738,4.9504,6.9223,2.1452,4.1021,0.0051,0.0,1.5193,0.3037,3.5204,2.7994,2.5344,6.4973,4.294,3.0449,2.2396,2.3681,5.6432,0.2146,3.4757,2.3382,3.2815,0.7954,0.557,3.5347,0.3389,0.835,0.4671,1.79,2.5627,0.6056,0.029,3.3349,7.4379,2.8886,1.9013,0.297,1.215,4.933,3.8595,1.1786,2.0487,3.1587,0.0738,3.624,2.2327,2.91,1.7806,1.1932,3.6053,2.9262,0.7046,1.8906,4.0783,4.0972,4.7938,0.8342,2.099,4.2936,5.5138,1.8642,3.5767,4.5802,2.1754,0.0002,4.3678,2.7002,2.8467,0.9152,3.7572,2.8712,2.3337,0.3571,1.1967,3.3016,2.1573,3.078,3.1244,0.1138,1.9488,0.6768,0.6173,3.0978,0.0076,0.004,3.0513,1.9397,3.4473,0.4573,4.2899,3.4915,2.5263,2.4548,7.4567,2.5796,3.5304,5.7996,6.3217,1.1612,2.2391,6.117,1.6335,5.5376,6.117,6.9915,0.0162,0.7505,4.7223,0.0034,4.163,5.5883,5.4225,2.0989,1.2875,1.4832,1.465,3.1576,0.8525,7.1337,0.0176,0.1638,0.2021,4.8818,5.4368,0.1765,5.4807,2.9621,1.1078,6.428,3.8474,2.4942,2.7403,2.4164,2.6592,6.5711,2.278,2.5865,3.3979,3.3401,4.2683,0.959,0.3851,1.8013,1.882,0.1042,1.0892,1.3546,1.1558,4.7062,3.187,0.9269,0.1938,6.3061,8.1254,1.989,6.1802,6.6353,0.44,0.2834,2.2619,8.0714,7.5783,3.4714,1.0505,3.921,5.421,5.8423,2.0277,2.6519,3.3252,2.2613,1.8642,0.9143,2.5717,0.0008,4.0871,0.5922,0.0742,3.7619,8.0105,4.0594,6.3236,0.3822,1.1258,4.8842,1.8067,1.9363,2.8088,0.2383,0.9565,1.4142,4.987,5.419,3.8933,4.4355,3.1986,0.5648,3.4537,1.6613,2.9115,3.5544,0.1242,0.819,2.6246,5.349,2.4308,1.2789,2.6047,5.9252,0.0008,3.9953,1.2271,5.5258,0.0586,2.6617,3.5465,6.7195,3.1295,0.9142,2.9668,1.8088,1.6775,2.7516,4.9545,2.3431,4.5246,1.2243,0.4516,3.1256,2.2842,6.6932,2.5061,5.1067,0.7984,1.9574,2.3855,0.2374,0.4246,2.0553,0.1751,5.4418,0.4159,1.5742,2.7149,2.4351,2.7719,0.6542,0.2897,3.5899,0.821,2.085,0.3859,0.0765,1.4792,0.4467,2.6547,5.1293,2.565,13.0557,2.3634,2.2978,6.405,4.3988,4.8796,2.0066,5.2743,2.4574,4.2447,1.0744,0.0002,1.5014,2.193,4.8589,0.7794,5.4379,0.684,0.1727,2.8399,2.1103,3.6215,0.0682,2.0722]}

However , they could","text":"On 1 March 2012, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway confirmed that Fowler was training with the Seasiders and that he could earn a deal until the end of the season. However, they could not agree on wages with Fowler and both sides decided to end their involvement with the club.\nOn 15 January 2013, Fowler joined Conference South's Havant Town on a one-month loan ( until 2 February 2013 ). He made two appearances before being recalled to Blackpool and ended his month with four appearances as a substitute.\nOn 4 November 2014, blackpool made a reported \u00a34.8m move for the French international midfielder. In February 2015, Fowler started his first match at the club's stadium, Carrow Road since leaving in 2013. He scored his first goal for the club, heading in a cross from Andy Carroll in the 62nd minute in a 3\u20131 win against Southend United.\nIn September 2015, Fowler joined Championship club Hull City. Fowler signed a one-year contract on the 31st of August, with the option of another year, but was unable to make an impression within his first three matches. He found himself starting in only one of his first six league games and scored his first team goal on his second match, in the 3\u20131 win against Southend United. After failing to impress, he joined Championship club Sheffield Wednesday.\nOn 4 January 2017, Fowler re-signed with Blackpool on a one-year contract that included an option for another year. On 28 January 2017, he scored a late winner after his previous goal had been cancelled out by Chris Martin, scoring in an 8\u20131 victory over Stoke City.\nOn 20 February 2018, Fowler returned to his former club Blackpool, but was made to miss the rest of the season after a hamstring injury.\nWith Birmingham City spending \u00a37.8m on a contract to sign Jordan Henderson, Blackpool went into the transfer window with the aim of signing a defender who could potentially cover Henderson's vacant left-back position, though a deal was not concluded. In February 2019 Fowler was released by Championship rivals Crystal Palace, after suffering an ankle injury which has left him with a chance of missing much of the 2019\/20 season.","token_len":451,"entropy":[6.4113,3.401,3.2941,0.3667,8.2739,3.7794,3.9536,4.5348,1.998,0.0092,3.2678,0.7957,10.2206,1.8182,6.4745,0.6644,1.1108,10.211,0.0551,2.2841,1.7646,1.0903,4.1019,7.763,0.915,4.5514,4.0697,0.7998,0.171,0.0022,0.3375,0.1967,0.2206,3.9518,0.0686,5.4888,4.0112,0.526,2.7714,1.089,5.7351,3.7048,3.8742,2.1743,5.5434,2.6721,4.3571,0.4776,5.9063,1.5309,4.8482,2.3559,0.4581,1.2641,1.099,0.3798,11.0937,3.7467,2.5491,1.2652,0.1016,2.8563,3.259,13.032,4.6693,5.5515,9.5922,1.4171,4.5927,2.2774,0.5311,2.7153,0.0731,4.0403,1.7954,6.2211,12.0023,4.9942,1.9873,0.5299,1.4869,1.2688,2.5323,3.6915,0.4621,4.7826,1.6032,2.963,0.924,3.8535,0.001,2.6596,5.6959,0.848,9.3145,1.2722,3.9465,1.2875,4.9641,0.9307,0.1264,0.5388,0.7819,0.993,3.3777,3.4094,3.2066,0.1208,7.8154,0.0256,3.817,1.0415,5.8859,0.2266,3.272,0.4605,2.647,0.3013,1.3089,0.2032,2.236,5.7051,1.0526,4.9585,1.7985,3.5727,3.9554,0.463,0.1316,2.4512,5.1497,1.9948,1.7273,3.4952,3.2343,2.0989,1.7943,1.9304,5.7168,1.7039,10.386,1.1887,0.0129,8.2334,4.1419,3.7018,4.7077,0.4501,1.4235,1.8006,2.018,0.4158,0.4432,1.3465,0.6622,0.9464,2.318,5.7016,1.7391,0.447,2.5666,0.5512,5.5123,2.7204,2.7119,0.2362,5.6084,0.0127,0.0032,4.5214,1.6854,1.9398,6.3468,0.7833,0.4904,3.1151,6.1816,0.4934,0.0002,0.6016,0.4781,0.732,2.5847,2.748,0.5496,0.0511,2.0073,1.8887,3.6782,2.3076,3.8611,0.2341,2.2467,4.1179,4.6196,0.4435,2.4062,0.0638,0.0625,0.8202,3.7589,3.3076,4.4668,0.1352,0.4294,2.9536,2.1141,2.3762,1.4383,3.3815,1.2808,3.3893,1.24,2.9256,2.3035,2.5017,2.4191,0.0027,2.2131,2.3906,2.1232,7.5029,2.701,0.4475,3.204,3.4093,0.8262,1.4366,6.486,1.463,5.8022,2.436,2.9643,1.6444,0.756,1.9648,0.6883,2.816,2.6893,0.8293,2.104,3.3298,2.0707,0.4847,5.6859,0.3008,3.1399,3.8356,4.2603,3.6025,2.3414,2.6999,1.145,2.1138,0.1248,0.813,0.7059,1.6341,3.6985,0.0111,0.0007,0.4976,0.3538,4.2763,4.3443,0.0372,2.6519,1.5333,1.1145,3.0016,2.147,0.8923,3.9039,0.1295,2.8746,0.7101,0.9042,3.1189,2.3265,2.9089,0.0324,1.7056,5.9694,0.0821,0.7401,0.94,2.7902,0.0015,2.699,0.1656,0.8459,0.0247,0.5312,1.4588,5.2577,2.3034,2.4338,0.4944,1.1973,1.8989,1.1324,0.4363,3.7901,3.9291,0.7903,1.5092,0.0403,0.9336,3.271,2.677,4.4705,0.7353,4.3784,3.5793,5.8819,1.9693,3.8997,0.3683,4.4784,1.4988,0.8241,5.8903,4.5002,2.3973,4.0238,2.933,4.326,2.6536,0.4259,1.4574,1.9233,0.5017,5.3767,0.18,0.5605,0.8704,0.7522,3.8309,2.0325,1.4153,0.0242,1.693,3.1296,0.0705,3.0445,2.0591,0.308,3.2769,0.0017,1.5824,2.8063,1.516,5.684,1.4564,2.1553,0.9564,1.5477,0.0006,0.0961,0.2623,2.7472,3.009,2.2888,0.2564,0.9509,1.3173,6.3611,6.3275,0.4786,8.8137,0.836,3.7412,0.6445,2.398,0.026,0.8327,3.0108,5.6742,3.2628,1.3299,7.0043,3.3738,0.9735,3.0033,0.0042,4.4948,1.843,0.373,2.0013,0.2004,0.9609,2.0727,5.1806,0.1667,1.011,1.7391,4.5421,2.5493,0.8945,4.1776,5.9508,5.2677,0.568,7.9337,2.8138,0.4126,0.099,0.9705,2.8927,3.5637,3.9041,1.4582,0.8235,0.6316,3.4635,0.8414,3.2173,2.9685,2.1356,6.0347,1.883,2.4912,0.5498,4.1265,5.3428,4.8251,0.0004,1.4443,3.3761,4.4789,2.1921,0.9259,0.1275,3.6984,4.6501,2.2089,0.1659,2.4786,0.8058,6.3263,0.3382,3.029,5.3342,0.0385,0.4439,4.3034,1.3496,0.0495,0.1384,0.1706]}
{"prompt":"The New Testament states Isaac was `` offered up `` by Abraham his father , and that Isaac blessed his sons . Paul contrasted Isaac , symbolizing Christian liberty , with the rejected older son","text":"The New Testament states Isaac was `` offered up `` by Abraham his father, and that Isaac blessed his sons. Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing Christian liberty, with the rejected older son, Jacob ; who represented the unredeemed, who were not worthy of God's blessing ( 2 Cor. 11:29 ). As a result of this, Jacob and his family became one of the main characters in the Old Testament, having a distinguished function in the deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt and the conquest of Canaan ( cf. Genesis 47 ). The genealogies in the Old Testament list the sons of Jacob as Abraham's heirs, and many of the patriarchs were descendants of Abraham ( cf. Judges 1:6 ; Ruth 1:3 ).\nMany Old Testament prophets and the last books of the Bible identify him as the father of Joseph, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, etc. ; but in all of these passages he is an older father, not to be compared with Abraham.\nFrom the Messiah's perspective, Joseph was not just a servant in Hebron whom God appeared to, but a son by the name of Joseph whom God made a patriarch of his own land. This idea is made explicit in the fourth chapter of Matthew, where Jesus says he came into this world through Joseph to the highest position of the patriarchs of old ( John 1:42, Luke 3:23 ). Indeed, the first mention of Joseph in the Old Testament is after he is mentioned in connection with Joseph, who became a great ruler of Egypt after his father, and his family are mentioned in relation to Pharaoh, in Exodus 1:35.\nThus it is seen that Joseph served as a link between Jacob ( before him ) and God and Jesus ( after him; cf. Luke 1:41 ).\nJesus stated at one time that he, of all people, would not want to know the patriarchs, because `` their work of righteousness is recorded with them. '' But with Joseph he clearly states, \" I have loved you with an everlasting love ; therefore I have preserved your life \" ( John 21:9 ).

He led all the way to the finish and finished almost two seconds ahead of Fernando Alonso, who was forced to take the second position when he was hit by the Sauber of Felipe Massa.\nThe race had a special significance for both teams, as both Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello got to drive their Ferrari for the first time at the rain-slicking circuit.\nThe Sauber of Juan Pablo Montoya became the first car to make it through the finishing line with two tires in the pit lane.\nMontoya was not ready to return to the race and was forced to use spare tire and wheels and was forced to retire later on.\nLewis Hamilton won the race from pole position, winning his third consecutive start in a three-race winning streak for his team, Mercedes.\nHe beat Michael Schumacher in the final restart but it was the most exciting result of the race with Michael Schumacher coming from fourth to win, thanks to a great race strategy.\nVettel finished second in what was an emotional end to one of the worst seasons in Formula One for Mercedes.","token_len":452,"entropy":[7.9762,2.6894,1.0418,8.1112,5.1372,0.0025,0.4868,2.4406,2.4303,5.0926,2.0293,10.5709,8.2944,1.251,5.1538,0.0077,3.7096,5.7745,1.7471,1.3653,6.2158,1.8156,4.9245,1.1449,1.2196,0.0555,3.2704,0.9995,8.2925,5.5481,3.946,1.2852,4.6084,0.8408,0.0001,0.501,0.6784,12.0317,3.4849,2.9387,3.0857,6.4456,3.5945,3.8801,1.0692,7.9327,0.0512,9.9182,0.6577,1.8257,2.0379,7.2311,0.4397,0.1037,4.7801,0.1685,1.0936,4.4866,0.2701,3.6676,1.9619,6.898,3.8136,5.0804,6.6093,6.9174,0.9862,0.6523,5.0276,5.2929,5.4859,1.8618,3.5621,1.008,2.5299,0.8699,1.7584,1.7521,2.3708,5.2464,0.2933,2.5924,0.7802,0.9536,0.3352,1.5903,0.0009,0.6604,0.1163,1.4977,4.9114,2.493,0.1079,0.4957,1.692,3.7497,0.9937,0.4149,1.9695,5.0745,6.5496,5.0046,4.8435,1.0494,4.5725,0.3103,0.0006,6.4381,0.7187,0.0883,3.3035,1.0974,1.3464,5.2243,1.904,1.0579,2.8809,2.3519,4.1579,4.4998,3.6337,1.2498,1.0038,1.6154,0.9798,0.5653,1.6852,5.9054,4.2926,1.6313,7.2356,6.1691,0.0017,4.6543,1.2042,3.1499,1.5166,4.1609,5.882,1.697,8.2752,0.2495,4.2494,0.924,6.3972,2.2267,7.7221,5.1638,1.6894,5.4913,0.8138,2.4274,5.7705,0.8454,1.8817,1.4389,0.724,1.7658,3.7056,1.4948,5.2312,2.6606,1.898,3.521,1.1928,1.043,4.5493,3.1187,0.7392,2.9382,6.3076,1.0707,5.5027,0.634,1.6461,3.6079,3.7945,4.6452,0.0027,2.9862,0.5139,2.6625,5.307,0.0036,0.5086,0.4324,8.2851,0.0644,5.7532,2.9506,3.4129,5.9965,4.4761,3.4303,2.0954,4.288,4.0379,6.7025,0.1399,0.0016,2.6463,1.9346,8.5777,5.8985,1.5126,0.7266,4.8439,0.2522,0.0002,6.2237,2.8119,1.6411,4.1027,0.5772,3.4511,0.0456,0.3377,1.2809,5.5665,0.0358,2.5471,3.292,0.0026,0.0,3.9521,4.3422,4.2822,3.5195,2.1213,0.1773,0.7925,0.7369,2.5951,2.4662,2.2748,7.7038,2.6177,0.6272,1.059,0.0492,4.2612,0.0001,2.1377,0.7369,1.6093,5.0205,0.2504,3.3882,1.4675,5.0535,1.9207,4.5309,1.4331,2.057,1.7391,0.2742,2.3805,5.963,0.0009,6.4182,4.1148,0.0003,0.0038,0.0003,0.3254,0.1333,1.4256,3.0774,3.7336,1.588,6.1191,1.816,0.5128,4.0508,1.0733,1.2103,1.0294,2.6491,9.8517,0.0386,0.0018,0.0001,0.1827,6.2201,0.0123,0.0009,0.003,0.0,6.0321,2.3911,3.6946,2.798,4.6064,3.4855,0.4029,0.7816,0.0735,3.4419,0.5369,9.8831,0.3578,4.0552,7.1481,3.2398,0.8104,0.2247,1.4778,5.5744,0.0019,2.5141,8.1991,0.148,0.017,0.0004,5.2939,0.1373,0.5918,3.3308,0.4677,3.4355,1.114,3.0413,0.639,6.1226,1.4394,2.8672,4.0952,8.063,2.8114,1.1966,4.5857,0.7652,0.9389,0.5773,6.4227,0.0011,1.9028,4.07,5.3585,0.6953,4.1431,0.4257,0.8791,2.492,3.1668,1.9975,1.5641,0.0444,4.0842,8.0965,4.0031,3.4307,6.938,4.488,2.3756,1.8078,0.0669,2.9568,5.6005,2.4913,0.8891,0.282,5.7607,0.1445,2.8789,0.9218,2.0269,4.5921,2.8149,0.3837,1.599,4.0639,3.0575,1.3927,2.2981,5.6809,2.2334,2.5419,5.5158,0.4846,2.1544,4.6557,0.1641,5.1095,3.1689,0.7388,2.1068,6.535,0.3169,0.5054,3.2764,5.4945,4.9172,0.017,0.0003,0.0005,1.5592,0.6704,2.1816,7.2414,3.4777,4.3062,0.256,2.1903,5.6211,4.5965,4.2405,0.9616,0.4256,1.4046,4.5073,4.6102,0.3979,0.0031,0.0013,3.9649,3.6739,3.1566,2.0226,1.5239,4.1943,5.9479,0.2549,1.1827,4.2362,3.9245,5.4682,1.2726,0.2579,5.3251,0.2588,2.8888,1.8139,1.4519,6.8182,0.6639,3.6441,4.7225,5.462,0.2989,4.7436,0.047,0.1399,4.3988,2.4894,1.0279,0.8379,0.5579,4.2887,3.0455,0.6951]}

Very little painting from Scottish churches survives. In 1294, William the Lion commissioned a small painting of the Last Supper, but this is believed to be extant only in the National Gallery.\nThe medieval church of Kelso was dedicated to All Saints, and it is thought that a church of this name existed at West Falkirk in the fourteenth century. The building was restored along with the rest of the cathedral in 1559.\nDuring the 16th century and up to the late 17th century, Kelso became important as the place of residence for the bishops of St Andrews and Edinburgh.\nJohn Knox preached at Kelso Chapel 1568, and on 17 May 1567 his first sermon in St Andrews was preached in this church.\nIn 1705, John Hamilton, the first minister of Glasgow, died in his house in Kelso. There is tradition that he wrote at least one of his books here.\nAmong the notable buildings of the first half of the 19th century were the Kelso High School, now a residence; the Kelso Chapel, now the Kelso Museum; and a house for the medical superintendent. In the first quart of the 19th century, Alexander Leslie built his Kelso Castle, near to the ruins of a Roman fort called the Stonesmen\u2019s Tower. In the centre of the town is the Kelso Museum, opened in 1981 at the old Kelso Chapel.\nThe town has a wide variety of shops. Many of them are in the heart of the old town, but also a number of shophouses are on the outskirts of town and along the High Street.\nThe Royal Mail office had operated from West Kirk and St Anne\u2019s Street since 1857, when it was taken over by the post office.\nThe town has also a bus station which is accessible from Edinburgh and Glasgow.\nFrom here it is accessible to a number of destinations, among which are Edinburgh Castle, Glasgow city centre, Falkirk, Paisley and Perth (to list as some of the main destinations with a direct bus connection).","token_len":452,"entropy":[11.5212,12.7555,8.6446,4.2337,0.4539,2.6516,5.8618,0.0209,0.9832,7.6722,1.0011,8.8839,6.2749,3.2968,0.4823,7.7691,2.0905,1.6042,6.7657,4.3073,12.8976,1.0829,8.9256,0.1246,12.914,3.5703,8.7784,6.3886,9.2322,2.4639,2.4629,8.1998,1.0531,8.4556,5.3592,10.349,5.0189,2.3396,1.4165,3.0956,3.916,5.2131,0.7789,4.4734,3.9658,4.5422,5.1723,1.2345,3.947,2.2177,1.1913,1.5179,7.8722,1.4424,0.0011,1.8644,3.615,2.9721,2.2757,4.7836,0.0963,1.2967,9.7385,0.9504,0.5106,1.4638,6.8848,1.178,1.612,1.802,6.0532,6.3285,2.658,1.9723,7.5119,0.0627,2.5068,4.1243,1.3177,8.8926,1.1222,2.0072,1.7361,2.7728,1.6386,3.3937,0.5944,4.1307,4.4362,2.0323,1.7787,2.7323,2.4646,2.0771,8.29,8.9458,0.2838,1.3692,1.0425,7.6667,0.0017,0.2221,0.371,1.6132,4.5739,1.2552,5.716,7.8587,0.0787,0.8153,4.0181,0.0093,0.2388,4.3754,1.4953,2.4831,4.3396,0.9704,1.6971,5.2967,0.2083,3.772,0.0808,0.3482,4.2768,4.7988,0.9134,0.344,2.6631,2.1846,0.0245,0.1467,0.4253,4.1514,0.0281,2.538,5.9392,1.0277,2.3262,3.7925,1.6775,4.5667,0.9641,1.4824,6.0661,0.6709,4.6305,3.8475,0.9983,4.0609,0.6187,2.4474,6.8656,5.3682,6.4425,1.1747,1.0276,0.022,6.1253,7.2251,4.8377,1.6625,1.0543,4.8265,3.1936,2.2802,0.6365,3.6863,3.8039,4.6035,0.2481,3.8906,4.1435,0.8581,0.7115,2.0323,1.8461,4.8507,1.0149,0.5366,1.5661,2.3353,2.4501,4.6807,0.9067,1.9773,9.5418,2.8528,2.1549,2.2042,4.3171,0.9112,5.177,0.5737,4.3069,1.7031,3.0856,5.1696,1.2287,1.8434,0.0247,1.0186,4.578,1.1793,8.2914,0.4734,1.0739,5.0976,4.0829,2.5629,1.8522,3.5808,0.7735,3.6068,5.6451,0.8547,0.654,6.3727,0.5064,5.4578,4.5589,1.4333,1.981,5.0886,5.2921,0.0734,0.0541,1.8286,0.0031,0.0527,1.2095,0.6647,3.7094,0.017,7.0648,1.7281,1.0211,5.1167,2.6622,6.758,7.8612,0.6054,2.4695,0.014,3.2994,1.0826,1.3005,1.7992,3.8194,0.0142,3.8444,0.5736,1.0133,3.2919,5.1879,3.2745,0.9812,8.6019,6.6908,1.9773,3.243,1.7706,5.0831,10.3153,4.1138,1.4197,1.9836,0.0088,0.0547,0.3867,6.9464,9.1145,3.5416,3.4397,3.6937,0.0134,3.9823,1.4016,4.7597,4.201,0.5851,6.5258,0.0523,3.1221,4.8953,2.8325,5.1574,2.1265,9.7654,7.787,14.393,7.728,7.1461,5.2611,0.8111,2.69,1.4491,8.1676,0.2007,0.4433,5.3515,1.9885,0.8197,1.4607,0.0161,3.4314,0.7977,6.7031,0.3561,7.8109,5.1046,0.7611,5.1208,3.3195,0.009,3.4686,0.7262,0.7149,1.7088,5.7595,3.4232,1.4193,4.8038,1.0182,0.0041,3.3355,3.5403,3.9535,1.007,1.4966,0.8796,2.6443,0.8531,6.0138,0.0336,0.6061,3.7295,1.2563,1.1893,2.7478,3.3748,3.292,2.5727,0.1434,7.3512,5.2321,0.0861,4.9492,2.9689,0.485,2.7005,0.7191,1.6855,3.2151,5.77,0.5881,6.5819,0.7879,0.6516,1.1886,1.7582,6.0679,4.7572,5.7097,5.5913,7.2807,3.9815,6.9976,3.925,5.5262,4.573,6.9094,9.4502,0.4408,0.1739,4.1299,3.1134,1.7686,4.2691,1.0754,3.2413,0.7202,1.1071,4.7862,0.1518,0.0717,0.7732,5.9979,0.6864,1.4197,1.6619,1.4715,4.0868,1.899,3.5707,2.0439,6.5897,2.1955,3.6264,1.5186,4.5789,1.1616,5.7334,2.3885,2.0023,0.7872,0.8646,4.7252,4.8586,2.7656,0.4936,7.1798,1.7952,4.2472,0.712,0.0006,3.7976,1.2586,6.9551,2.1015,1.1146,3.779,3.9641,0.5318,3.8834,6.7564,0.2045,0.355,6.0273,0.0004,1.6202,8.3467,0.2931,0.0459,2.004,5.9447,4.542,5.7769,7.1371,6.5485,4.7004,1.3376,0.6017,4.5292,1.777,6.1055,2.2415,5.3988,4.1963,2.7673,1.5155]}

An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late","text":"As the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1880s, but it soon met strong opposition from local residents.\nThe Colorado River Basin, like many other large river basins has faced declines in water availability owing to both increased demand and reductions in potential water supply. In the United States and elsewhere, the use of groundwater, particularly for irrigated agriculture, has increased dramatically during recent decades in many regions. In recent decades, groundwater abstractions have generally increased at a faster rate for agriculture than for other uses. With groundwater being the major source of water supplies, it is critical to understand groundwater flow processes as it relates to hydrologic balance in groundwater systems. In many areas, groundwater resources are threatened by over-use for many reasons, including excessive pumping for domestic, agricultural, and industrial water supplies. Groundwater resources are increasingly being used in an environment with limited precipitation, high evaporative loss, and high salinities. Many of the major cities, towns, and irrigation districts in the western USA are using groundwater as their primary water source. Most of this use is for urban and agricultural irrigation purposes, in which much of the groundwater is pumped from shallow and interconnected aquifers that are located within the alluvium (sand and gravel deposits), in addition to a large proportion of aquifers that are located deeper and at greater distance from the water table. This report represents a comprehensive review of the groundwater resource in the Colorado River Basin. The main focus of the report has been to evaluate how the resource has evolved in various areas of the West by using data collected since the 1960s. The report also presents some new and unique information, such as detailed groundwater resource assessments using geophysical information to quantify the spatial variability of the aquifer thickness. Information concerning aquifer recharge is also provided by evaluating the geologic framework of the Colorado River Basin, which shows how different geologic units control groundwater flow and the recharge potential of these aquifers. The purpose of this report is to provide the state and regional agencies with a better understanding of the nature and condition of the groundwater resources in the Colorado River Basin in general.","token_len":452,"entropy":[2.9307,5.5011,0.0907,7.033,2.6382,9.3728,1.37,1.8554,7.8002,0.6542,2.1547,6.0715,0.3187,0.8155,3.4564,1.9584,0.1159,4.0024,2.431,1.295,5.6969,4.5924,3.2089,2.6885,7.4058,0.0187,1.7839,0.8743,4.3799,0.3507,2.422,4.8216,0.4071,1.7221,2.0834,3.3852,0.1031,1.3663,1.07,2.4077,3.4732,8.7803,8.3329,0.7453,0.4886,3.0308,2.6952,1.455,1.8791,8.9233,1.816,0.1582,2.8432,2.8344,4.7453,2.6323,1.1584,4.7677,2.8939,1.0562,0.0,8.6859,6.172,7.4665,0.9854,1.6819,2.8114,6.4055,0.0415,6.3032,4.5767,3.4281,1.1808,6.9064,0.0231,7.2083,2.3635,2.4523,0.5938,2.3821,1.4576,4.1229,0.0056,4.1422,2.9037,0.1219,1.6238,6.378,0.0158,2.8601,3.5832,2.7757,2.7789,3.2714,0.296,2.0999,0.1813,0.4977,2.1869,1.6183,3.6937,3.0869,0.303,4.691,4.2954,2.6501,1.195,2.3278,3.4006,1.1838,0.1508,1.7948,14.088,0.4755,0.9495,6.0887,2.1558,4.5524,1.3516,0.9494,0.1088,6.3877,4.3188,1.2947,0.7232,1.6552,2.1002,1.2784,5.4624,3.4681,4.4559,2.4134,3.3406,0.4846,0.0594,1.3811,4.8007,1.3187,2.0844,0.4623,3.7136,1.3109,2.923,3.1387,4.2614,6.7397,3.1033,4.3923,1.1796,0.0093,5.2336,1.8978,0.0456,5.3725,2.6339,6.0266,1.8593,0.2964,3.1236,3.7222,1.9437,0.431,0.7394,6.2998,0.7044,6.6885,0.6139,3.6298,2.0721,1.0017,6.4892,4.8333,1.4443,0.8922,0.5976,4.4956,4.226,5.6827,7.1388,3.9257,2.496,0.479,0.2988,1.4619,4.8658,1.7125,0.6682,6.2115,0.0414,4.2097,1.0938,4.6914,1.4931,1.9855,2.3725,4.7812,5.3269,2.887,2.8252,5.7448,1.6163,2.7827,8.516,0.195,6.1001,0.6868,0.3339,2.0773,4.313,4.8917,0.3346,0.7808,4.9452,1.5312,0.9725,3.2368,6.3787,2.098,1.8997,0.0979,0.1893,5.9816,0.8338,1.2926,0.4289,4.5031,5.8405,1.4188,4.8858,0.5339,1.8403,1.9238,0.5883,2.0275,0.0793,0.7095,4.8957,1.0133,3.5237,3.8656,0.7363,3.4846,4.492,2.0386,2.2103,2.2521,2.6482,1.1545,5.0336,2.0546,6.2364,0.2524,0.2061,1.4771,0.7886,4.8453,2.6888,6.5171,4.1496,7.8219,1.9666,0.0666,0.0021,3.581,1.1274,3.2817,2.7837,1.3025,10.0034,0.0438,4.3691,3.3619,5.0249,3.0424,1.5515,2.6465,3.3489,4.2665,4.6424,0.0027,4.4957,2.0948,3.8085,0.451,3.293,0.0633,0.0052,2.0197,0.4659,2.0373,5.9742,2.1432,6.4586,2.8699,6.1382,0.2761,1.0097,2.5473,2.297,0.1801,3.2127,8.4293,6.9266,1.6039,2.8169,1.7569,0.0963,1.2613,2.4018,3.3631,3.7593,0.6361,2.0594,0.1874,0.1648,1.3263,2.2409,4.7422,2.9445,0.209,1.3184,0.3956,4.6801,0.102,2.581,2.5544,3.5637,1.5663,5.6486,2.6464,3.2087,2.5368,5.2354,2.4848,1.1972,0.2356,6.0303,6.524,2.3097,2.9187,2.5017,4.7188,1.007,3.0221,0.0311,1.2214,1.4037,2.0109,1.9318,4.3311,3.465,4.3038,2.9686,4.6184,2.3448,3.2554,1.4674,0.0018,6.2851,3.1896,4.5129,4.3967,5.4823,4.5361,1.2549,4.0926,4.3377,3.7227,1.3017,5.2967,3.5379,0.5279,1.2998,4.2868,0.656,9.1508,2.3095,6.0803,4.3113,3.916,0.632,5.8065,3.1058,1.398,1.7201,1.849,9.0149,1.2621,4.4649,1.5102,8.2478,1.7951,0.6107,1.5439,0.1143,0.0984,1.4788,1.7588,4.7187,2.7114,3.5781,4.0007,0.2649,5.0528,8.43,1.947,1.5666,1.849,2.6274,6.8365,2.9936,0.4374,4.8892,4.9842,0.0216,0.0027,0.2046,1.4987,5.6577,0.0082,0.4011,0.3516,0.1107,0.1018,1.4115,3.1766,5.3073,1.4677,4.6742,4.2726,0.6857,1.5265,3.1177,0.0669,0.0432,0.6789,5.6579,0.8754,6.118,0.0091,0.4999,3.2409,1.6876,0.6025,0.2888,0.3335,0.0133,0.0342,4.5345,2.7455,2.2226]}

As the undeveloped highway travels into Bethel Township, it begins to curve on a more gently down-grade to the east then eventually turns sharply to the north, heading into the town just south of the village of Bethel. There, it becomes known as the northern end of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.\nFrom the Pennsylvania Turnpike's northeastern terminus, a partial bypass of Bethel Township runs to the southeast. In Bethel Township, PA 261 passes the communities of Bethel, Beechview, and West Bethel in Delaware County. West Bethel and Beechview are both small communities, largely consisting of homes and business premises. The route generally runs through wooded areas and farms with a single residential house and few businesses. A number of small commercial establishments, such as a restaurant, gas station, convenience store, and small hardware store, are located along the route, although many of these are located towards the Pennsylvania border. The community of West Bethel has one main house with a small outbuilding and five single-family homes.\nAbout five miles (8\u00a0km) north of West Bethel, PA 261 crosses over the Delaware Valley, which is bordered by Delaware National Forest. A small drainage canal comes into existence at the time of a bridge on the route; the structure had been built at a previous road used by the township itself. A couple of miles further north, PA 261 passes under the Delaware River and enters the southern part of Delaware Township.

One of the most prominent concerns","text":"Rider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the fin de si\u00e8cle. One of the most prominent concerns of that period was the perceived threat of social deterioration and degeneration brought about by immigration from Continental countries. Haggard\u2019s views were strongly influenced by a number of philosophers of the era, most notably the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Despite this, Haggard was of a decidedly anti \u2013Nietzschean persuasion, and viewed Nietzsche\u2019s work as a means of fostering degeneration in society [\u2026]\nTessellating and the Dense Set is a topic we cover much more closely on page 738 where we give an example, namely the set, A = (1). This is the empty set. By default, when you use the empty set you mean to denote this. So this is a way of making a distinction between an empty set and the empty list. Now for this particular example that\u2019s not too difficult, we could just get rid of the list and just say that this set is just A = (1) = [1 ]. But this isn\u2019t nearly as good a way of marking up the contents in this case. As a matter of fact, the obvious next step is [\u2026]\nThe topic of dense sets is one that is not so often touched upon in the chapter that we\u2019re talking about this morning. This is because there are such a variety of different things that we could deal with here, some of them so difficult to deal with that the topic itself doesn\u2019t attract a great deal of attention. But of course, once you\u2019ve got it down, it can be really fun. We start here with our familiar notion of the empty set, and also the notion of a singleton set that is a set with just one element. An example would be our set, B = {0, 1 }. As we know the trivial fact about the empty set, that it is defined to be the set consisting of precisely one element. We could say that our set B is the singleton set { 0 } or even put it another way, B = [\u2026]","token_len":454,"entropy":[9.1311,7.2415,5.3795,0.3685,8.6637,0.4966,8.1786,1.3022,3.0801,5.0504,1.9176,4.5469,0.8295,1.8834,0.9407,6.8008,0.8697,8.2347,6.8444,0.0012,0.1078,2.5559,6.654,1.2869,3.7023,6.9092,0.0001,2.5531,5.5775,0.5197,11.6939,2.6313,0.0613,0.0027,0.0015,3.5809,4.8685,0.947,0.5995,1.6765,2.3713,4.3092,1.6969,4.4249,2.2574,0.2425,0.701,5.6267,2.088,1.0197,5.0754,6.4536,2.2362,6.4246,0.1325,6.6952,0.5664,0.0313,4.3297,2.2936,7.6611,5.0916,0.4616,4.131,0.0062,0.0008,14.8285,9.4223,4.5265,3.6475,1.949,4.3852,1.5478,0.0585,2.8948,3.2662,0.0021,8.3508,2.3705,1.1504,4.3039,0.9383,3.8769,0.2578,2.5912,3.535,1.0112,2.3596,0.3497,0.8922,5.8138,3.3328,0.6807,0.6667,0.001,0.0013,1.9123,5.5106,2.0864,2.7139,3.3329,11.0608,10.5269,0.0144,0.0001,0.2576,5.0461,1.8396,1.4394,6.0528,4.2855,4.4031,0.1642,0.0131,2.4101,0.4818,1.7423,4.5938,0.8423,6.4881,6.5366,0.284,2.4613,1.7252,12.0763,2.4167,18.8824,1.6967,4.5061,3.611,2.437,6.3797,7.3202,9.9534,6.9916,1.2151,7.889,5.0678,3.4503,6.7258,0.534,4.5094,3.7198,5.1284,4.2042,6.3122,6.2858,0.7718,5.2918,1.9554,4.5117,5.9378,6.4329,1.7347,5.4527,4.6354,8.0424,6.8355,4.1076,2.494,5.0532,2.5197,1.2536,2.2511,9.2333,0.9965,2.6425,6.5057,5.5915,0.3256,4.7682,2.1355,3.7348,1.4073,3.4007,0.1447,2.3809,4.3018,3.712,6.2966,5.3872,4.7336,3.9353,4.065,1.1783,1.8851,7.3612,0.4879,4.2355,2.0733,4.6318,0.3623,3.7237,0.2113,0.1173,0.313,1.957,4.3555,6.1407,0.7256,5.4324,4.6212,3.3586,4.0345,1.726,4.5708,13.42,0.4654,0.0215,3.41,4.4433,2.828,1.8492,2.1056,3.9904,3.991,5.9728,1.1557,0.0046,0.8088,4.4087,1.7123,2.3735,1.8111,1.1489,1.9672,2.068,0.6857,4.4996,4.202,1.7773,0.9192,0.2962,1.7219,4.108,4.5064,0.894,8.0381,3.2215,1.9489,3.8939,2.6733,0.1525,0.0484,6.5322,0.3552,4.046,2.4359,0.8436,0.4575,4.8819,2.8156,1.5488,5.9647,5.054,2.8488,1.9845,1.0991,3.9141,2.6114,1.8989,0.0022,0.1023,0.2162,2.1526,7.262,4.9939,0.9657,0.8602,9.2354,0.3177,2.7055,8.2161,0.8963,9.9114,0.3534,0.8938,2.9222,0.703,2.2127,2.9199,3.9259,3.8358,3.4606,0.8736,1.0666,1.5436,7.5011,3.6061,3.4293,9.9477,0.0783,3.6215,2.899,0.0147,5.2457,4.4494,0.4994,2.792,0.6978,2.3882,3.0298,0.9714,5.2556,0.8284,4.0227,0.0338,2.9892,4.3471,0.7197,3.2146,2.8039,6.9659,0.0151,2.5126,1.71,3.7308,0.3387,1.6429,4.0689,5.381,1.7229,2.8601,0.0067,0.6088,3.434,4.3764,3.4095,4.0859,0.2999,0.0272,0.0028,7.7267,3.3433,2.7706,0.0202,0.0313,0.413,0.3823,2.6859,5.4041,0.2411,0.932,4.8523,0.7491,4.8204,0.0663,1.4049,2.095,3.6429,2.1052,1.3041,1.9495,2.7053,0.8257,3.1832,2.2415,1.716,3.3069,4.5299,4.0758,0.6618,4.3695,5.8379,5.3697,0.2365,1.7925,3.4389,0.1542,1.3306,2.5658,5.7037,1.6021,2.5514,0.2365,1.8447,4.6946,4.2343,2.6814,3.329,1.2485,3.089,2.1112,2.6456,4.6258,0.8507,1.7088,0.9053,5.2973,2.2164,2.4099,0.068,4.1071,2.6607,2.3238,2.4096,0.412,5.499,3.3945,0.39,0.8524,5.0982,3.9761,3.9807,1.4893,2.4022,4.9341,10.055,5.6108,4.5033,2.0067,2.6713,0.0762,0.8088,3.0646,3.9587,0.7734,5.6672,3.9236,0.5032,2.9569,1.5698,4.9143,0.1378,8.7239,0.6044,0.2377,3.4472,2.8991,1.7194,2.4814,0.4912,4.304,0.2759,4.6027,1.7164,1.9364,5.43,0.0059,0.2995,5.8511,3.4534,3.8296,3.6373,3.4101,8.3046,0.824,2.9325,0.001,0.5966,3.5605,0.635,9.31]}

With the orphanage on the brink of bankruptcy, Kyle defies his mother to go on a \" bucket list \" of things that he wishes to do as a young adult, without taking any money out of the orphanage's finances. With his best friend Jax, Kyle decides to find an old and unknown gem of a place with which he can pay off the debt of the orphanage. Kyle and Jax find a castle in the old mining town of Trowbridge in upstate New York. Kyle and Jax buy the property at high prices to pay the rent on the abandoned hospitality home that has been leased to the orphanage since the Depression.\nThe brothers learn they can rent the house as a holiday home. After several years renting, Kyle and Jax buy the place for $ 5,500 from the new owners, who used to be the bank that owned the property. They hire a contractor and start renovation work as they are working on a master suite for themselves, which is to be used as an outpost for the brothers for their future businesses, especially, for their mining venture. Kyle and Jax hire a contractor to renovate the house and then build a new deck as a place for a grill for their friends and families. Kyle is also renovating the property to build for himself and his brother's business ventures. The brothers set to work on the renovations with Kyle leading the work. However, when Kyle gets hired to go out for work one day, he runs away. Kyle and Jax discover his body in the woods on a bridge, apparently hanging.\nWhen Jax gets home to the orphanage and learns of Kyle's death, he decides to go outdoors to find the bridge, which is not on the map at all, and find out if there is any sign of death.

Lopez ( No. 03-629 ).\nIn the present case, the Court of Appeal reversed the jury verdict, but affirmed the conviction.\nOn January 6, 2007, the Court granted Lopez'appeal to the U.\nS.\nSupreme Court.This appeal involves issues unique to U. S.\ncargos, and the Court is addressing the question of whether a defendant cannot be convicted of a crime committed outside of the United States, yet is still subject to the imposition of the death penalty pursuant to U. S.\nCriminal Code \u00a7 2126.\nThe Supreme Court has previously held, however, that if an act that is punishable as a crime under United States law also is punishable in the foreign state that a defendant was present at the time of commission of the act, the death penalty cannot be imposed.See, United States v. Flores, 560 U.S. 832 ( 2010 ).\nCiting this viewpoint, the Court in Lopez argued that even though the same crime has been committed twice, each separate crime cannot be considered separately from the other crimes committed by the same person.See, U.S. v. Lopez, No. 09-631.\nThe Court has held that under these circumstances the death penalty is imposed only upon a defendant if such a defendant has committed each separate act that made up the crime, even though that defendant acted in an individual capacity.See, U.S. v. Flores, 560 U.S. at 839-40, 844.\nIn this particular case, the facts, as stated by the Court, indicate that it was a defendant's role to arrange the various crimes in preparation for the crime of possession of a firearm with intent to commit bank robbery.","token_len":457,"entropy":[8.0223,3.1533,0.365,4.5946,0.2439,1.8329,8.136,1.2097,0.6218,11.4809,6.7201,5.2754,3.7623,2.7732,4.4354,0.8101,3.3734,2.8232,0.5217,3.8935,0.065,8.4795,6.636,6.3432,0.0042,8.0207,1.0562,4.2242,0.9312,4.1258,4.839,7.9169,4.1692,0.4529,6.9979,2.3932,1.6572,0.3618,0.6942,1.7458,4.3929,1.1405,0.2565,2.4722,0.8678,1.5859,8.024,2.3777,1.2509,1.2843,4.5906,0.2392,4.0091,1.4538,4.6587,5.395,3.8381,0.7073,5.1962,0.0014,0.0913,0.5005,5.1581,4.6247,5.3984,9.9078,0.1391,1.1704,2.3299,4.561,0.7447,7.9014,6.4982,2.4252,0.001,0.0835,6.846,3.2613,2.2461,4.0125,1.6307,1.7961,1.6557,4.712,0.4367,0.4696,0.0924,1.9673,0.6551,0.2361,0.4119,2.1669,2.8851,2.0855,0.7012,3.1174,5.7994,0.0116,0.3458,0.8035,6.593,2.6005,9.3138,0.3721,3.3018,0.2225,9.1993,6.3027,1.0506,2.2105,2.1516,3.1174,0.1462,0.3299,0.818,2.1672,0.2199,0.9413,4.6643,0.8758,3.7143,0.4132,3.3109,3.4055,5.054,0.5401,2.548,2.3594,1.0561,2.828,2.3711,3.0057,0.0054,2.5776,0.0916,0.3341,1.5189,6.1126,5.1145,4.1882,12.3769,0.4885,2.2459,0.3108,4.1033,0.0031,10.516,5.2558,0.0167,5.7894,2.8026,0.0107,0.0179,2.53,8.8636,2.0974,4.1069,2.4111,8.6397,0.044,4.6712,0.0024,3.1104,0.0617,3.0526,6.4673,5.1172,1.2212,2.0739,2.3421,2.7989,3.3917,3.4015,7.2706,1.7205,2.3361,1.1237,0.8719,2.1892,2.0142,4.4804,0.7523,1.6916,0.6419,1.1594,1.1557,4.9383,3.5793,1.4578,0.7565,1.1292,0.0055,2.109,7.4556,2.6376,3.5712,1.8304,0.0203,1.1311,4.2638,0.0471,1.9597,3.4104,0.0416,5.3208,0.0094,3.4544,0.0018,0.3116,0.0045,2.042,3.8739,2.5417,0.299,1.2993,3.8443,7.4192,1.2341,1.5898,1.7286,3.7073,0.0412,2.3401,3.4993,1.4249,3.5378,3.1731,0.0246,0.0776,4.1767,2.8092,4.0026,3.9984,1.2815,3.205,3.0126,0.2835,2.1412,2.9825,4.9019,0.052,0.9265,6.9176,2.0311,0.5885,3.5161,0.5528,5.6008,3.0432,5.0949,5.8328,0.2663,2.7508,4.7636,1.1484,0.3782,0.6669,0.2617,5.5104,0.2081,0.1561,1.4073,0.2669,1.1805,4.4982,0.1082,2.7133,0.1572,0.3466,0.8679,7.3094,1.7887,7.4325,0.0085,0.0025,0.009,5.8817,1.1556,7.3539,0.5493,0.0008,0.898,0.0401,3.4628,4.7161,1.7374,12.9867,1.1041,0.6029,4.8132,3.0791,5.4145,7.3713,0.133,0.5701,0.7762,3.9378,2.6057,5.5764,0.314,4.8509,1.5464,0.8331,6.5204,3.3012,3.8528,0.703,0.9835,6.426,1.859,4.2681,9.5445,1.2932,3.9879,0.2608,2.2307,3.9596,3.3674,0.2201,1.0373,5.0338,2.2649,1.9902,0.3163,0.2505,0.5898,0.5766,4.8131,0.8198,4.4766,0.0014,1.2684,0.0028,0.0327,0.0012,2.2795,0.0921,3.9956,0.0022,5.4649,0.0262,4.4176,3.7148,2.262,0.3292,1.3218,1.3092,4.6175,1.8888,0.3499,5.0883,5.5166,0.7882,2.2489,1.823,0.0327,1.3511,3.9549,2.2517,3.2761,2.0012,1.8139,4.9053,5.3303,2.0066,1.0291,2.6221,1.069,4.2624,3.688,2.5282,2.5292,6.2013,4.0507,0.3484,0.4914,2.2731,3.6717,0.8446,3.4063,2.5441,4.7887,1.1066,3.4778,3.3615,1.3048,1.3699,1.997,0.2581,2.4256,0.0007,0.2137,0.0012,0.0025,0.0011,1.8783,0.0056,0.9158,0.0038,0.0008,0.0013,0.0051,3.5076,0.1069,3.0396,1.2715,0.7656,2.306,1.7232,2.6653,2.0714,0.5967,1.9405,2.0224,4.9068,0.0996,0.1341,0.753,5.6515,4.7289,2.0314,2.8345,1.5252,0.3953,2.3189,0.8085,4.4436,0.1303,4.3807,0.8709,2.0088,2.1196,2.8679,4.2297,1.0405,6.1999,2.0249,7.7929,3.6194,2.7709,7.6921,0.1481,0.8886,3.4635,2.2267,6.0862,0.3641,1.1444,0.6068,5.2665,0.3588,0.0356,2.3069,11.2193,0.0831,1.1627]}
{"prompt":"In 1924 Gerard Olivier , a habitually frugal man , told his son that not only must he gain admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art , but he must also","text":"In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that not only must he gain admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also have no means of payment. In 1926, after being an unsuccessful applicant, he was forced to pay \u00a330 to secure his admission. Once inside, he realised, he found it difficult to pay, so he found work as an assistant lecturer to help pay the debts. For the next four years he was in debt to the school, after which time Gerard Olivier found work at the Royal Academy of Music in the summer holidays, in charge of the music choir. In August 1928, in a panic, he was able to pay his indebtedness. He did not return as a lecturer after that, though he took private lessons on the piano until he was 39. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society when he was living in London. He became a member of the Royal Borough of Greenwich in 1932 ; the council appointed him \" Honorary Member of the Corporation \" in 1936.\nA photographer by trade, Gerard Olivier kept a large collection of negatives taken in Europe and India between 1910 and 1927, and these served as the basis for his studies. For his doctorate Olivier used photographs of men in his collection who had undergone facial plastic surgery, using surgical techniques that had been established before Gerard Olivier's time, but that, according to some scholars, had \" never reached the clinic of any Englishman \". From the 1920s Gerard Olivier began using photography as an artistic medium. The subject of his best-known work after 1926 was the figure of the dancer, using a simplified expression of the dance for which he was a practitioner.\nGerard Olivier was the brother of Alfred Olivier, who also studied fine art under Robert Jameson at the Slade School.

{"prompt":"The key claim advanced by lawyer John H. Martindale in all four cases had been that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was invalid because it was not signed by the Seneca leaders","text":"The key claim advanced by lawyer John H. Martindale in all four cases had been that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was invalid because it was not signed by the Seneca leaders. There were two provisions of the Treaty which could not be made effective because the Seneca were not represented to sign: the provisions relating to the location of the new Indian Territory and the settlement of reservations. When the Commissioners of Indian Affairs arrived in the country, however, they decided to ignore a number of demands of the Seneca Indians, including those that the people of the Indian Territory should not be separated from the people they already lived with.\nIn 1843 they reached an agreement with William H. Harrison, who was a superintendent of Indian Affairs when the Seneca were living in Delaware, regarding the location of the Indian Territory. However, the Seneca were not content with the terms and refused to accept the Harrison agreement. They objected that the new location of the Indian Territory did not conform to the Treaty on behalf of the Delawares. They had a very strong case, though, because the provisions had been negotiated and agreed upon by both parties and there was no record of the Seneca agreeing to any part of it. When the Seneca agreed to give up certain reservations to the new Indian Territory, and the people of Delaware gave up lands to the Indian Territory, they would have been committing a violation of their terms, and the Indians felt they had been cheated.\nWhen Judge William O. Douglas visited the Indian Territory to review the Commissioners' findings, he declared that the Indian Territory was within the boundary of the Indian treaty (the Treaty of 1836). Douglas' opinion was supported by Attorney General John Quincy Adams, who found in the Record of a Congressional Debate:\n\"The Seneca did give up a certain land in the Indian Territory to the Indians of New York. It was not by agreement but by force from them, and forced over into the Indian Territory, and by treaty they reserved their land.\n\" [I]t is the general rule of this country's law that the treaty is law, and it is the rule of this country's law, also, that it is impossible to break a treaty unless there is a proper cause for doing so.","token_len":458,"entropy":[7.1775,8.1793,9.4838,0.5143,9.9317,3.7483,4.6227,1.5983,8.4635,3.098,0.0052,2.1671,8.2837,4.5398,1.0784,7.6763,0.6769,0.4926,1.1081,11.0836,1.064,10.2937,7.9039,3.8342,9.6777,5.3518,1.5504,1.3504,4.4954,1.4081,0.8709,1.7411,1.5762,3.7206,0.4463,0.9786,8.7611,0.088,7.8243,0.9786,5.1578,1.9434,2.4904,7.1743,1.7039,0.2081,0.9333,2.4404,4.0803,1.5763,0.488,5.1948,4.7829,3.444,1.726,1.9533,0.0067,3.2574,1.4787,4.0119,5.8042,2.8052,6.1994,1.7373,5.6358,3.4463,0.0225,1.1431,7.2185,0.155,0.6035,6.1997,4.5661,2.6508,1.7148,0.5219,5.6195,0.1831,5.0826,1.1296,5.6086,0.8206,11.7434,0.9176,1.953,0.2286,4.4613,0.5927,2.4679,5.3304,1.7729,5.3608,0.0031,0.9371,3.9665,0.993,5.3977,5.3211,4.3762,0.0029,6.8332,2.9285,0.2937,1.3674,0.0091,4.1263,1.7657,1.9125,4.84,3.2676,1.7748,6.4187,0.9405,0.7458,3.01,0.08,0.8199,2.1595,0.5028,5.5112,0.3038,0.506,3.5124,7.8356,4.3545,4.142,3.5379,0.9705,2.505,5.6931,2.1141,2.9216,4.2595,4.6971,2.0537,0.0423,0.579,7.1938,2.7912,0.2182,5.4529,0.7888,2.3135,1.6395,2.3937,7.4131,0.5217,1.8084,0.5877,6.2602,0.4906,2.2527,0.0015,1.6339,3.9456,0.4298,5.6122,1.9374,3.9089,0.5119,3.7295,0.0769,0.2894,2.2726,0.1504,0.4904,4.4949,0.043,1.5154,2.4559,0.0026,1.9874,1.1719,7.3428,0.793,1.5555,3.1563,2.705,5.8708,0.1112,2.5439,0.7793,10.1826,1.4967,0.599,2.3505,5.4632,3.0891,0.6619,4.9416,5.8003,1.0121,0.0755,0.5597,0.0197,3.5314,0.015,4.07,0.4984,0.562,2.5079,5.1123,8.5665,0.0014,0.2294,9.7022,1.1465,0.0064,1.614,1.8102,3.8043,3.6299,4.119,2.2509,1.7175,2.8478,4.1175,0.7498,4.6131,1.0327,7.0722,5.6789,0.8079,5.3065,3.1661,3.6677,0.5911,0.9627,2.7777,1.4568,2.6962,3.4674,0.4484,0.5749,6.9974,0.3172,1.4692,3.5524,0.002,3.025,0.3366,2.8882,4.0307,0.1052,1.8466,0.2662,4.2623,0.6581,3.0226,0.0017,4.4265,0.2776,4.9411,0.4333,6.2177,2.3738,2.2737,0.3878,4.6733,1.0098,0.0362,0.4602,4.1302,2.1216,5.5576,0.6222,3.8569,4.8953,0.2284,5.0597,1.7344,0.4328,4.3373,0.2138,0.3586,1.8987,4.6682,1.8083,1.8968,7.9898,1.4483,2.8641,0.0634,3.2786,6.4542,2.9035,1.4193,1.5806,5.1509,5.5637,2.3032,0.9999,1.5752,3.0629,0.6513,1.2113,3.9621,5.839,4.4462,4.1969,0.4097,5.0557,4.8384,0.3719,3.3158,0.1418,3.5398,4.0573,0.3041,10.3599,0.3653,3.5481,0.6119,0.4113,5.4917,0.4408,0.7255,3.9498,0.3025,0.9417,5.2811,0.4288,4.3423,0.2201,0.3615,3.3649,5.9285,4.8102,3.263,1.6574,0.4374,4.5316,3.718,1.8484,4.2838,4.9968,2.8051,0.661,3.1632,0.0891,6.4099,0.3751,3.4233,7.5251,0.1352,0.7941,0.5793,5.0722,3.2526,0.4608,6.765,1.2816,4.3108,4.9999,5.9681,3.7412,0.4147,1.0574,1.2566,4.2863,0.0046,4.1916,5.7712,0.1546,3.1059,3.8103,5.2873,2.4683,1.2174,1.9486,0.052,1.2934,0.2977,2.4713,3.011,3.0129,0.3854,1.8822,2.2815,0.7779,2.1005,5.1554,3.3432,6.0845,0.7535,2.9101,4.9395,3.4108,1.7955,1.1591,8.5626,7.156,5.1689,0.8683,1.6757,0.1234,1.367,1.7055,4.2538,4.9498,2.6375,8.2629,2.9584,3.0766,2.1806,3.8742,0.5717,10.3745,5.344,4.3287,1.2606,1.1883,3.4406,5.2683,1.1514,2.4341,3.17,2.4634,8.2044,2.6814,0.4828,1.3973,4.1112,2.783,7.1212,1.7138,0.7598,2.9901,0.4851,1.9306,3.0774,0.3109,2.0383,1.0837,0.5138,2.2362,2.956,7.6842,1.1115,0.1704,2.9849,0.7141,5.472,0.9792,5.0057,2.3144,0.1671,3.921,2.5863,0.5436,0.8007,6.4214,3.2186,1.1982,2.3093,0.0386,0.6475]}

'' It was decided in the spring of 2013 that, while not an answer, this film would be helpful visually and conceptually in helping us reflect on and answer this crucial question.\nIn October 2013 we received final approval for a production budget. This was then raised to $500,000 to fund production and worldwide marketing. We raised the funds to $800,000 over the winter and spring of 2013. The most significant support came from companies such as Google, which donated $250,000. We also received significant support from individual donors, foundations and corporate and volunteer organizations. We received $60,000 from the Wikimedia Foundation and $28,000 from the Wikimedia Foundation and Google.org.\nThe film's first major production goal is funding. We are seeking investors willing to contribute $5,000 or more for the project. The production goals, once funding is raised, are :\nThe first production meeting of the film was held in mid-March. The production team's first major project is a script rewrite. We have reached out to a number of writers around the world, including Steven Erlebacher of the Creative Commons and Richard Lonsdale ( who wrote the screenplay for the BBC series The Bill Shakespeare Company ) to help with that goal. We will also be looking for a producer who can take on all the technical aspects of the project.\nThe majority of the screenplay is written in the first person ; this type of writing style can often be difficult to maintain in two and a third person presentations, especially for longer works like feature films. The film will have two major storytellers : a human and the Wikipedia community. These storytellers will both have a unique voice, yet the two combined will offer an authentic look at what Wikipedia is and how it works. The film will also focus on two of the more prominent administrators, who show how it is possible for an unusually bright, motivated group of people to create a significant, impactful resource in a relatively short period of time. For this reason the film will explore in great detail the community who created Wikipedia.","token_len":459,"entropy":[7.4866,11.7327,3.7865,4.8341,4.3537,0.1998,0.5138,8.3982,0.5938,6.1874,6.1169,1.6375,5.545,0.3562,1.2205,8.7899,4.0012,0.8059,1.9706,11.5842,2.9621,10.5364,2.8986,1.8407,0.6137,8.6744,1.0737,1.0267,3.9393,10.4641,3.2932,2.8465,10.1179,3.9508,7.1709,1.2645,1.9933,2.0628,4.0418,3.6494,1.1192,4.0018,4.4074,1.5674,5.7535,0.604,3.8119,0.4368,4.3314,3.478,4.381,3.2191,5.0733,1.1663,3.7491,3.3124,0.7185,1.1178,6.0302,11.3154,1.4214,5.0643,0.0011,2.3493,2.9039,2.9787,7.0507,0.3357,3.4609,3.4369,2.8442,6.0261,0.1156,0.5833,2.1245,4.7186,4.6561,0.903,3.3604,2.3809,7.1907,0.8791,1.7407,2.6921,3.748,4.5251,5.3769,2.8558,1.5499,5.7111,6.0399,0.9259,0.6344,3.5829,0.1476,0.0116,2.7153,3.3585,3.2048,2.0037,7.2565,3.1699,0.8693,2.3388,5.3093,1.9996,3.2528,1.6373,5.3846,4.5405,0.0317,0.0052,5.1996,0.6595,5.6942,1.968,3.2606,0.2752,2.8114,1.3206,2.1251,6.0062,2.4127,6.3986,0.7529,0.1448,7.7282,1.3843,0.0038,4.0859,0.706,3.6209,3.1521,0.833,3.6995,0.089,0.0125,2.2526,2.125,1.8688,0.7839,5.1247,0.8385,0.0509,6.5752,3.1946,1.6234,6.92,1.1109,5.3789,4.1048,7.1398,1.5218,0.7148,1.951,2.7898,2.516,4.5468,0.0461,0.0246,1.0414,1.8727,5.4209,0.0263,1.4539,0.5893,5.582,0.0039,0.1054,0.0564,1.0725,2.9383,0.2769,3.7022,5.8348,1.6089,3.9781,0.6993,1.3639,1.9939,1.442,2.8872,3.2475,3.4416,3.313,5.0315,2.859,5.6802,2.9487,1.6817,2.0857,5.0455,6.0902,6.8648,0.0203,2.6517,0.9773,2.8286,0.2482,0.0399,1.5753,0.13,2.4802,1.2595,2.5108,0.7344,1.9274,4.6728,6.7874,5.0392,5.6377,7.7067,0.4692,3.7465,0.2103,1.76,8.1911,0.7904,2.962,2.7372,2.8987,6.8138,2.562,0.6486,1.3631,2.5574,0.4488,0.9481,5.2986,0.173,2.4263,2.5466,1.5856,3.9391,1.1107,5.3061,2.3901,3.7688,2.1997,2.0093,2.6059,6.2892,5.3571,1.895,2.2731,2.2699,5.6998,1.5603,0.0905,2.9567,0.7874,0.0019,4.3324,5.5107,0.0947,0.2471,2.0226,1.0454,6.1657,8.6242,3.8992,8.7347,6.3394,3.7861,2.7169,6.2119,0.9088,3.3905,4.7505,4.7896,6.4203,0.1225,4.8797,7.99,3.1315,0.7246,1.4544,1.01,0.839,7.695,2.6298,2.3688,7.138,8.2413,3.949,1.8059,1.2975,2.6595,2.2196,4.5053,5.3798,0.1693,1.713,2.5254,1.494,0.9157,4.1925,1.3164,2.1697,3.2798,1.6484,1.1301,4.0085,1.4813,4.4467,1.506,3.4423,2.0375,0.2297,0.3952,0.8639,1.0107,1.1892,1.0911,5.8047,0.0196,0.5159,5.109,1.3207,1.6529,2.1187,2.2988,3.74,1.1306,6.0307,2.9439,6.4611,0.0172,1.6913,5.4736,3.0292,3.7176,0.6066,2.0928,0.5576,3.8921,2.0232,6.4221,5.8131,0.5637,9.3764,0.1483,6.3705,2.3524,2.1162,2.4161,7.2386,4.5303,3.5539,4.2622,0.5563,0.5254,2.0883,2.8492,2.8511,2.7762,4.4494,2.6132,5.0095,3.9794,0.0245,3.0805,3.6021,6.6909,1.744,4.4403,6.9505,4.5436,0.9342,4.1225,4.7786,0.0603,0.0019,0.6863,4.6381,2.0819,1.6516,3.78,3.538,2.3938,5.4646,3.381,4.3926,8.0356,0.9109,4.9138,2.653,5.1157,4.6194,0.4948,3.1598,1.1328,0.8892,2.186,1.0277,0.6901,1.5046,0.3573,1.8971,2.245,0.4665,1.3244,5.023,0.1773,4.1691,2.2473,0.2838,4.468,2.1194,7.5327,3.0046,3.4384,9.4667,4.0426,4.7319,1.5603,1.6959,1.3347,3.795,9.7626,6.5243,2.422,5.6603,4.6594,0.253,0.5899,0.3556,4.2004,1.0779,5.9534,3.664,4.0897,0.0131,4.7818,3.1064,1.3692,3.0598,0.1724,0.8843,0.0215,0.0009,0.2172,5.3362,1.6134,0.644,3.5521,1.6505,0.7323,5.2793,6.1406,3.6,0.2285,0.8251,6.3104,5.4278,2.4069,1.0785,1.639]}

The custom of lighting the bridge has continued, and the flares are often used by politicians and other dignitaries.\nThere is a narrow footpath which is generally used for pedestrian traffic and other foot activities and it is known as Bridge Road. The bridge is closed for vehicular traffic between 1 January \u2013 31 May and 8 December \u2013 31 March. On weekends and bank holidays the bridge is free for traffic.\nThe bridge has a single lane of traffic in each direction. The pavement on Bridge Road is usually well used, but it is difficult to access or use. There is a parking area next to the entrance to the railway station at the corner of Bridge Rd and West Bridge Rd.\nTowards West Bridge Road, there is an access under Bridge Rd bridge and then a public footpath which leads along the river edge. The bridge entrance is under the stone viaduct at the northern end of the bridge. To the west is a footpath which runs towards West Bridge Road.\nA second bridge near the west end is a footbridge. Bridge Rd and West Bridge Rd are separated at the northern end by one of the few stonework tunnels in the town. In some cases a bridge over the tunnel is formed part of a railway viaduct and in other cases a bridge is built on the outside but beneath the railway, providing an escape route in times of need. It is possible to swim under the bridge as it is in one of the best swimming hole areas in the Lake District.\nThere is a footpath \/ bridlepath called The Watermill Track for dog walkers which runs through the woodland to East Bridge Rd at the edge of a small pond.\nWakefield Bridge is in the Lake District National Park, part of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The bridge has a large area at its eastern end which is the site of an earthwork fortification built by the Second World War German occupiers of the National Park.\nThe bridge is in a protected site of rare conservation value and is a landmark in the town of High Wycombe and is one of the town's most popular tourist attractions.","token_len":459,"entropy":[7.4778,2.7731,4.9897,3.9458,0.4875,1.8992,9.3125,0.8337,7.908,1.5397,13.2402,5.6524,4.5769,4.7811,5.3971,2.184,9.8776,1.9146,3.2289,5.7464,1.059,6.4657,1.5238,1.2393,1.5886,3.1737,1.0017,1.8136,8.8831,1.7852,2.2737,0.9942,0.4234,4.733,3.2268,2.576,1.8041,1.8681,6.9228,1.304,3.9231,1.8055,2.509,6.4094,1.2921,2.7584,1.0026,0.0009,0.0001,1.3246,0.9825,9.1997,1.3548,1.4258,7.8895,6.9142,2.1896,4.0591,2.8186,5.6934,2.017,1.4295,5.5254,2.0339,2.7871,4.6644,6.2184,8.4918,4.2715,2.8679,0.6587,3.7738,0.4881,6.7409,3.7049,0.8104,1.6254,1.241,1.034,3.5765,2.372,6.0783,0.0009,0.3846,4.1553,4.0494,2.8464,8.1167,3.0862,2.6845,2.8888,5.1339,1.755,3.3774,4.373,2.4207,0.7105,4.7446,5.6517,2.1682,12.1122,0.0497,2.0203,0.3552,0.3967,6.5863,2.6969,4.5274,1.0923,0.8296,1.7672,1.4574,2.2913,1.5595,5.0318,2.3947,2.0696,1.6827,3.8095,1.7837,0.0744,1.4436,1.4595,6.8759,2.9818,6.8542,0.0131,0.4978,4.1773,4.7862,4.9115,1.5385,1.2824,2.3745,0.5921,3.8329,0.1426,4.3401,4.9436,2.8106,2.8543,2.9435,0.9416,0.8609,5.2276,1.6546,5.2836,0.0336,0.1543,4.6541,1.3541,0.1777,6.9857,0.6388,3.0381,0.6639,3.8835,0.0569,1.1935,5.3306,0.5154,5.3663,5.7255,0.9589,0.4731,1.5109,5.6552,2.3149,0.1004,5.3537,2.2663,1.1298,1.3084,2.4316,0.3689,2.4719,4.2689,7.8369,3.1363,0.8332,7.3737,3.0494,4.6259,1.8037,6.2421,4.8174,0.1397,3.0317,2.1242,5.2556,0.6351,4.2022,7.5043,1.1465,1.6254,1.2866,4.7606,0.7452,5.271,0.9106,7.1828,7.5006,0.0013,0.0,2.3605,0.713,5.6035,0.3276,0.175,0.3317,0.8801,0.7196,4.9102,1.1313,1.882,1.4928,0.6744,4.8406,0.308,1.6085,3.0393,6.2134,2.4695,0.4143,1.8624,0.7926,0.9925,3.1969,5.5651,1.7943,5.5087,0.7579,3.7202,0.4283,2.843,2.3666,3.4166,3.4524,2.7721,7.2335,1.8564,2.5581,0.2144,0.0774,0.2984,0.9234,2.4358,4.7842,0.7145,3.5145,0.2561,0.4188,5.4501,2.7641,0.3487,5.5889,6.3884,2.923,0.0589,4.6936,2.2108,0.4071,3.0026,0.5383,3.9477,4.5477,2.3494,2.8383,2.7274,3.8028,0.6639,6.4876,1.2402,6.3801,9.0583,0.0332,1.8411,3.8834,5.9516,0.0008,0.0011,2.5143,3.9371,1.0571,0.2641,1.1171,1.172,2.5704,2.4481,2.2622,1.0081,4.8633,6.9323,5.6345,0.6375,2.69,4.8989,5.5542,2.8147,3.912,1.3787,4.929,7.1105,0.0808,2.7293,0.1923,4.1525,0.2661,2.7948,0.2253,6.4639,3.3288,0.3004,0.5428,4.401,1.7222,0.7396,4.1716,4.8571,0.8955,0.2405,4.4465,5.8608,7.4745,3.2699,0.661,0.7562,8.9837,1.3165,0.403,0.6785,3.2229,0.8411,0.5295,4.5214,2.1678,10.3393,6.329,0.2026,5.8441,5.866,4.3675,5.0138,7.4355,7.0353,4.6311,9.3033,1.2752,0.0659,3.8214,1.7226,3.0809,0.3819,7.0423,3.0951,5.2624,1.0187,1.08,4.5124,0.7175,4.3478,0.0114,4.9289,2.8982,3.3899,0.6082,2.0096,4.7683,5.1914,3.6484,2.168,2.2869,4.6219,0.7986,4.9904,0.0626,8.022,0.2863,1.9134,5.2219,0.0055,0.6678,8.3652,1.106,6.4244,0.5832,1.358,2.2172,0.8384,1.6322,1.9328,2.5941,1.1437,3.3647,4.6848,5.1083,2.6649,4.035,0.4739,2.5107,0.9294,4.2061,4.0102,0.025,3.1093,8.9378,2.4097,7.1595,0.8566,4.3171,1.6499,0.9571,6.6577,2.2989,0.0084,5.9634,3.8083,0.0448,2.9224,0.8215,5.4111,0.6766,0.7663,1.4777,1.6308,1.7094,1.0463,4.0716,1.9188,3.9164,5.4067,4.6645,7.9522,6.226,2.013,1.7222,1.234,3.1095,5.2578,1.628,0.8005,4.6774,1.0804,8.2736,4.6116,0.1319,2.8315,1.9834,2.8205,0.0083,0.3325,5.2928,0.0584,1.4348,1.4449,1.4163,0.3545,0.1355]}

This provision of the constitution is an occasional source of conflict between the president and the central government. After Croatia's declaration of independence at the end of the year, a new office was created at the Croatian president's Office and a special unit of the police specializing in constitutional affairs (President of Croatia, 2010, p. 6) (see figure 2 ). \nInternational Conference on Management, Economics and Social Sciences (ICMESS 2013): \"Business, Management and Social Sciences\"\n\nAvoiding confrontation, negotiation and compromise\nAs was mentioned, Croatia has a strong tradition of dialogue and mediation in its relations with neighbouring States. The President (of Croatia, 2010) is often the president of the informal meetings. One more role of the president is his capacity for international relations, thus his internationalization of domestic politics. We can see this feature in the way relations between Croatian and Serbian states are defined. This statement was in the beginning of the year, where the Croatian president declared that Croatia has established friendly relations with Serbia (see Figure 3).\nFig. 3: Presidential statement about relations between Croatia and Serbia (source: http:\/\/president.croatia.hr)\nOn the other hand, some Croats state that Croatia is closer to Turkey, the EU, Germany as well as its close neighbours of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We can see that the president has also some degree of international influence and that can often reflect on the decisions, but on a more general view he is not a very influential politician in Croatia because of his relatively young age (he is in his thirties) and also because of his national origins. \nConclusions\nFrom the above analysis, we can say that the President of Croatia is a fairly influential and influential politician in his country. If he plays this role in the national foreign policy as well as internationally, he will contribute to the further development of Croatia and will help to strengthen its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. This is due to the fact that Croatia's current strategy and foreign policy is more focused on integration in the EU, thus this cooperation will help to make its economic, social as well as political policies more advanced.","token_len":460,"entropy":[7.6611,1.6302,7.2886,3.0878,1.4346,3.9389,10.8777,1.248,1.3771,5.5023,1.4958,0.6779,0.0034,5.2693,0.1994,4.5362,0.5482,1.6415,3.864,8.6368,3.1025,0.682,5.768,2.1434,3.391,10.7398,4.8706,0.0492,3.3234,1.9265,0.4949,7.5286,0.2949,0.5534,7.2907,0.113,0.8334,6.3628,3.5882,1.1819,3.6645,0.1571,0.0832,5.9365,0.0967,0.5583,0.0017,2.1282,3.3671,0.6756,3.5749,2.7833,8.4665,0.7582,0.5604,3.6363,0.3032,2.2056,6.1034,0.0728,6.8327,3.2612,2.3732,3.0729,4.4612,1.8765,0.543,5.3775,10.7329,0.0183,6.1056,4.0948,5.4174,6.9802,3.2035,1.3888,2.0687,9.8078,2.7412,1.7089,0.1544,3.8098,2.2221,4.9451,2.2459,6.0214,2.4374,5.5106,9.3572,4.4721,10.6695,7.2228,0.4112,9.9602,3.1911,6.1645,0.5031,3.2813,4.026,1.4795,0.6992,0.6387,6.134,7.6943,4.2493,3.7145,8.4358,2.4853,4.9934,0.6416,3.3495,3.2,2.081,2.1949,4.2428,11.683,0.7032,5.5332,2.9338,5.778,0.5522,2.2295,1.9264,18.7946,5.8241,3.4797,3.0175,4.0448,1.7454,2.2771,2.5623,2.9866,0.1271,4.1856,1.0644,6.0851,2.6951,2.5733,1.4978,0.0202,5.7437,4.5093,0.6229,1.7589,3.0605,5.277,6.1071,0.1059,1.8166,1.8332,2.0003,3.4335,3.9845,2.7782,6.3176,0.4005,0.6673,9.1125,5.5884,3.5512,5.7514,7.4376,7.2172,1.9316,0.3531,1.6682,1.0306,5.6676,5.0036,2.5748,5.8049,2.8838,1.8294,6.2055,3.4265,5.3882,4.0999,2.0367,5.8119,2.9188,0.8639,6.3895,3.7058,2.0779,2.2131,6.9715,0.6677,0.6637,4.4526,5.5839,0.459,4.8155,1.1224,2.6768,3.3953,1.4683,4.8997,1.7085,4.2908,5.9172,3.4164,5.0473,2.2093,5.6341,0.8049,0.6169,3.4287,1.6533,6.2183,1.1694,2.9575,2.4347,5.7527,1.3783,3.495,3.6887,5.5665,6.2138,0.0943,0.0815,0.2632,3.439,2.3362,2.9022,1.0612,2.4374,2.3151,12.5928,0.6451,0.1313,1.9671,5.9775,2.9208,4.1246,2.0382,0.3463,1.2591,0.0693,0.1019,2.034,7.162,0.2512,4.6452,0.0006,8.5044,1.5675,5.1422,0.6507,0.1753,0.0479,5.9108,2.6033,0.4134,8.9341,0.7252,1.1997,0.0457,0.0396,4.5834,9.9239,0.3075,6.8753,0.1687,3.3544,1.9603,6.5648,0.1575,6.3043,1.9118,3.1173,2.873,1.2725,3.6709,6.6378,0.2122,0.012,5.2555,5.9745,3.7326,5.8988,4.6718,1.1306,3.7785,0.3816,3.1313,1.7811,0.0215,0.0008,0.0001,0.0008,0.7059,4.3609,1.2075,0.6102,0.8325,1.8984,3.0565,2.4194,2.9389,7.1017,5.7256,0.0197,3.107,1.6019,2.9537,3.5662,8.4447,5.6623,6.6911,2.4139,1.1079,4.7913,5.4582,5.5836,5.0414,2.1355,1.9894,2.8334,4.7103,5.1187,1.289,2.081,2.1391,3.791,4.7315,3.625,2.605,2.2196,4.8414,0.7658,0.4891,5.7432,5.2866,0.0536,1.7363,4.7337,1.0972,3.9509,0.0546,2.7088,0.0006,0.0008,2.1923,0.3324,5.0052,0.4105,0.8488,0.4662,5.9827,4.0746,0.8181,4.9551,0.1635,5.823,1.0802,0.5351,10.9131,0.8196,2.8896,4.6094,0.8903,1.1,0.5023,3.2701,0.0735,1.0915,2.1567,0.8854,0.0586,1.4697,1.5384,5.6933,3.5602,2.3526,2.3662,1.8288,1.2755,2.3371,0.4894,0.6577,4.858,1.527,5.7047,4.4153,0.0396,2.2672,1.5359,3.8991,7.2119,0.082,5.1754,1.0784,0.2752,4.4329,0.2528,1.421,1.2564,5.4536,0.5859,0.8559,6.3324,0.4978,0.0749,1.4974,2.4978,2.5417,3.2872,1.1725,2.9865,1.5232,5.2068,2.7242,3.4004,0.3403,2.0693,0.0204,0.2038,3.1451,1.383,4.0056,0.3479,0.8862,0.7644,0.0173,2.3575,2.4488,4.1857,7.2414,2.5794,4.5942,0.0982,1.6621,4.6029,3.569,0.1082,6.6246,3.668,1.1072,3.2816,1.8053,5.882,5.0968,6.1216,1.5173,2.5167,0.707,4.3045,3.8901,4.2819,2.6722,1.0283,9.3451,0.001,0.0153,1.0605,4.7193,0.6068,7.8515,0.594]}

The film also won three awards at the 1976 Bengal Film Academy Awards including Best Script and Best Editing - all won by Sholay team members. In the 1979 Filmfare Awards, Sholay was named one of the Top 10 Films of the 20th Century for its strong visual impact on the audience.

In 1979 Sholay was nominated for a Goldene Kamera Award at the Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn 1981 Sholay was featured prominently in an article by New York Times Magazine in which it was called \"a modern adaptation of the legend of Rama, a heroic Hindu king and conqueror who fought for religious tolerance in ancient India\". Another review in an Indian newspaper, Tribune of India, declared \"Sholay\" to be \"magically poetic\" and \"one of the finest Hindi films ever made\".\nThe music of Sholay is also considered one of the best compositions of Satyajit Ray with R.D.

To do that they got the best result of any team in the history in first division scoring. They finished in third place, behind West Ham United and Birmingham City, with a loss in their final game of the season to Tottenham Hotspur. They had eight league games remaining but managed to win six of them and only came from behind twice in the process. Manchester United, also referred to as United, and simply The Red Devils, is an English professional football team based in Manchester City, England. It is a member club of the Premier League and plays its home games at Old Trafford, which is sometimes known as the Theatre of Dreams as an homage to its capacity.\nThe two sides last faced in the FA Cup in a memorable tie in the round of 16 in September. A goal by midfielder Wayne Rooney gave the home side a stunning victory over their opponents. Both sides have now faced each other in the Premiership. It was the first time this season that both teams had conceded less than or equal to two league goals.\nAnd if you had just read only what I wrote at that time that meant I said United will win the league. In reality I was wrong. In the beginning of the tournament, West Ham United beat Manchester United in the Premier League and the teams have been struggling with each other in both leagues. The teams met in the Premiership in a very tight game, where both teams started the match without being decisive.\nThe final day of the Premier League sees three teams make their final shots at the title. The London rivals go head to head with both teams needing just a third point to claim the crown at this year's summer's footballing fiesta.","token_len":460,"entropy":[7.9591,3.5827,5.4926,9.6148,13.8265,1.4377,1.9402,7.982,5.4133,8.1493,2.1484,11.0856,6.126,11.1108,0.5191,4.8757,2.1375,8.3292,0.1945,6.8462,0.3759,4.1046,8.5491,2.343,4.8436,9.0063,3.3758,3.6722,4.9026,11.337,0.7519,0.4755,2.0716,0.128,0.1406,2.5265,5.9793,0.2049,1.2087,8.1362,0.1761,0.2013,1.0284,0.0436,0.0893,3.8437,2.3541,0.9331,0.5136,1.1652,0.0443,0.1048,1.6035,1.2621,2.934,0.2202,0.0695,0.4592,0.0055,0.057,1.9816,5.6227,1.5136,1.2401,1.1107,3.5457,0.2329,3.3301,5.8114,0.8572,0.4126,0.8178,1.0248,1.0043,1.1442,1.0905,0.8473,0.5872,0.4059,5.7502,0.08,7.3559,5.1566,0.5026,2.1844,2.3606,2.8769,6.5615,1.5848,0.8624,2.0937,1.9785,2.9834,3.1675,4.462,8.5821,4.3223,2.3863,12.9893,2.3879,5.6109,6.9077,5.9283,3.3352,5.1175,1.2451,2.2325,1.1906,4.2287,1.2459,0.9986,0.0322,0.332,0.0139,0.0245,0.8172,1.7093,1.4228,0.4162,2.5734,0.0117,3.8762,1.8855,0.7329,5.7367,5.9819,3.5724,3.4401,5.7328,2.3678,4.1653,4.0852,1.989,2.0604,2.2562,0.8113,0.6864,5.059,7.4465,6.8936,6.249,7.0215,1.6712,3.177,3.1887,2.4813,1.6375,0.957,2.2585,2.8896,4.7665,0.2113,0.6569,1.5204,5.1408,0.1064,1.7848,2.7401,2.3546,6.3331,2.5781,3.0334,2.4787,2.3784,1.4321,0.1551,0.4191,1.7387,4.1147,0.1612,0.0025,0.6884,2.549,3.5325,6.551,3.4482,1.2276,2.2228,3.1266,4.5855,0.7416,2.5878,4.0233,1.0082,0.7459,3.083,5.2036,5.505,3.9227,0.6058,6.1575,1.4224,0.9822,5.1128,0.2561,3.167,0.136,3.5925,5.591,8.2058,0.0332,0.1228,2.712,2.141,6.0455,9.4766,7.5362,5.2516,0.4343,0.522,4.8886,3.1001,1.4695,5.6788,0.6768,0.8204,2.3193,0.1693,2.4291,3.7722,1.8573,1.8821,0.36,2.7962,1.3693,2.2803,5.0097,7.5403,0.1212,0.3389,2.6828,0.0167,1.467,4.5689,3.5055,0.9096,0.6382,0.9625,2.2633,0.0027,1.9836,3.4377,1.2949,6.1917,2.9792,0.0892,1.2017,8.1113,0.6504,0.5894,5.7866,4.622,4.3731,0.112,3.1326,9.3828,1.139,3.3579,4.4798,5.5915,3.6305,5.7566,5.0072,4.9992,0.6391,2.0415,0.0709,2.4409,5.0445,6.6068,4.7348,1.4774,2.3536,7.0208,0.0897,0.2138,2.7498,4.986,4.177,4.5214,4.0042,1.7892,5.7509,4.0632,0.094,3.8405,1.5931,4.0762,0.1536,0.6707,6.8915,3.5341,2.4276,4.525,2.5584,1.5508,5.1553,1.0094,3.286,2.9814,5.2775,1.2808,0.0257,1.5222,0.9976,6.9766,3.5682,4.184,0.8969,1.3524,0.9489,0.3112,3.5598,0.4884,0.5283,2.0398,1.1958,1.5435,5.6439,4.7459,0.4088,8.7446,0.0944,0.0717,4.0019,5.5042,0.1163,1.1562,2.28,6.1801,4.9899,1.0195,4.3467,5.013,3.3515,8.0387,4.9633,3.3269,1.9363,4.1407,3.867,0.7012,5.4228,5.7534,2.8763,4.6073,4.0597,3.8127,2.3086,0.8566,2.2348,1.5521,3.9195,4.0668,2.9321,2.6056,1.7917,0.4501,3.3675,2.1605,6.9284,1.2875,0.9451,4.9673,2.1577,5.1085,0.0832,0.9825,4.5971,1.8465,0.3176,2.1747,0.821,3.9646,0.0088,2.7659,2.6621,6.0518,3.5541,2.05,5.4478,3.7098,2.7836,0.0133,2.1748,5.1061,3.0731,0.8096,2.2982,3.9056,5.7865,1.0992,0.5558,6.1206,1.8129,2.859,4.7055,3.7534,2.1678,2.5627,3.7805,2.3011,0.6708,4.6747,2.1065,1.9125,4.3697,4.6489,7.6391,0.6691,2.8446,2.0839,4.1981,4.8889,0.5901,0.2829,3.7998,0.0022,8.6572,5.2452,1.3617,5.3636,1.7246,2.2561,8.3306,1.182,0.8064,2.215,0.6055,2.2043,6.7575,2.7666,6.0827,3.1548,0.4593,0.0016,1.0288,5.0511,2.6836,8.5591,1.9539,3.3526,4.2759,3.1873,0.4996,3.4373,0.5345,4.4908,4.7369,4.0666,3.6069,0.0009,6.9604,1.1742,5.6335,3.8983,7.8693,1.6148,0.3452]}
{"prompt":"Red Rackham 's Treasure = Red Rackham 's Treasure ( French : Le Tr\u00e9sor de Rackham le Rouge ) is the twelfth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist","text":"Red Rackham's Treasure = Red Rackham's Treasure ( French : Le Tr\u00e9sor de Rackham le Rouge ) is the twelfth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Herg\u00e9. It was published in France on January 1, 1953, and later in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\nIt was an international bestseller in the 1950s, and there is evidence that it was also a very successful film adaptation. The movie, released on November 27, 1960, was the most successful in Herg\u00e9's career, and grossed $28,300,000. It was also the most expensive film ever made by a Belgian company. The book was re-released in 2006 by Hachette.\nThe plot revolves around young Tintin, who as a boy living in the 1930s Europe, dreams of being a famous detective after hearing about the stories of the great detective Miss Marple. His dream soon takes shape when his grandfather, Professor Tournesol, gives him an envelope containing a map with a yellow star, a key, and a phrase: \" The secret of the Unicorn \".\nWith these ingredients he sets off to solve a series of mysteries that take him through many beautiful countries of the world. Before long, he becomes one of the heroes of Belgian media and a success.\nThe novel also contains a subplot of the story of how he finds the book Le Lotus bleu, which was written by a Belgian professor who disappeared in a mysterious way after giving Tintin the map. To find the professor, Tintin travels to Cairo and meets Captain Haddock, who is a scientist with a passionate obsession for Egyptian artifacts.\nThis subplot is later included in the book The Secret of the Unicorn, while the plot of the book The Secret of the Unicorn is reused in The Mystery of the Obelisk.\nThe book has been adapted into a few different media, including a movie adaptation in 2000. It has also been adapted into other film and television productions. The adaptation was filmed using a mix of live action and computer-generated animation, making it the first non-live-action film of the series and first film featuring a CGI animated character.","token_len":460,"entropy":[11.8757,8.1147,2.1252,9.5728,7.1166,6.3169,1.033,0.0004,0.0839,0.6179,3.8894,14.0207,4.5389,5.1713,5.4792,1.9904,1.1073,1.5966,8.3591,0.0115,6.6112,7.1978,0.7956,4.3889,2.1359,8.6322,0.0121,4.9584,0.4032,2.8662,3.9398,0.0352,4.0191,1.8001,0.0244,1.981,2.2764,8.3347,1.5766,1.9299,7.5121,1.7231,0.0222,9.3797,6.4133,0.3875,3.1844,2.0439,1.3809,0.8497,0.5471,2.9858,2.5782,2.8879,2.7382,0.1341,5.5625,1.545,0.6345,4.5028,1.6117,3.0267,2.7362,3.3966,2.2101,0.3669,2.5109,0.341,2.9445,0.4321,1.2083,1.3856,1.9712,0.7434,1.4966,10.3974,1.1198,4.4607,4.0547,2.1908,0.4702,2.4654,1.7971,6.2455,0.1576,1.1708,0.9891,6.2587,2.1061,4.0552,0.6199,0.9932,1.1417,2.8416,1.6887,3.5399,1.6099,5.6672,3.5365,0.8227,1.767,3.0283,2.4478,4.5686,2.1318,2.4578,3.6369,0.053,3.1513,0.1869,1.3329,2.2982,3.2991,0.7398,3.3106,11.0412,0.5326,0.0012,0.0097,1.6504,0.9748,1.4386,5.4157,0.0421,1.5659,5.424,3.512,4.6816,0.7289,0.2539,1.2751,2.1593,0.9479,1.4385,0.9102,2.193,2.8448,1.462,1.1927,0.258,2.2483,0.5909,3.0448,5.747,1.1025,1.7937,4.1742,1.4156,5.2649,1.2743,0.542,0.7937,5.411,2.7376,5.0464,2.5765,0.0343,0.0016,2.5462,0.7813,1.7005,6.4539,2.6835,0.0202,6.7242,2.2433,0.004,0.0041,1.0753,1.3945,5.4797,0.7647,2.545,7.3147,0.5174,1.7644,6.6804,0.0225,10.2473,1.3171,5.5389,0.1537,2.201,0.8875,4.7829,3.641,5.7342,5.6476,1.7366,1.3165,6.8978,0.3208,1.9104,3.792,2.0252,9.429,5.3565,6.1553,1.4181,4.0057,1.5252,5.1998,4.1026,4.2364,1.8564,2.5991,5.1941,1.4568,6.4627,2.4699,9.5094,5.8085,10.7611,0.4975,4.6054,0.3472,2.6817,5.103,0.8555,1.1549,3.8689,4.33,1.8131,5.8833,3.2893,2.7983,1.7609,5.6537,2.3013,0.5284,0.6308,6.5742,2.9347,0.4993,7.7096,4.9067,0.8189,1.2832,9.4016,2.0681,1.7611,5.7245,4.9264,6.2633,2.8162,3.2033,1.179,1.8689,4.7622,1.4616,2.4953,0.0027,1.2632,2.1454,4.4616,0.8614,3.353,4.0977,6.5142,2.4666,3.6583,0.5566,0.3425,0.8856,6.5085,1.8959,1.0691,0.6733,4.1986,3.0488,0.0737,0.1882,4.5475,0.304,8.2733,7.3171,1.8926,3.4892,6.9417,2.7538,1.2309,1.6791,3.0396,4.4631,2.8973,1.4632,6.8492,1.0026,2.5559,1.4621,2.6838,1.1858,3.589,3.0506,4.6601,2.3679,4.6067,7.6365,9.6711,12.3793,0.5252,1.7806,1.1637,2.1702,2.9182,0.7645,3.1692,1.9732,5.1004,2.1275,6.9783,1.3606,2.8727,3.57,4.1404,2.8324,6.0021,3.973,0.0043,0.0062,1.3967,2.9774,0.5324,5.7722,3.2187,1.2562,5.2546,0.4723,0.4409,0.0219,0.0012,3.6464,0.8828,8.6105,2.0616,2.1894,7.3052,4.5653,4.5521,0.8613,1.5338,1.7232,2.3012,4.9373,2.9684,1.4572,8.896,5.2329,0.8075,6.5305,3.3913,0.2881,1.7225,4.2294,2.8595,0.006,1.5931,4.1374,4.2805,0.1262,0.8174,1.6099,2.2418,2.2611,0.6575,0.2297,0.0433,1.7964,6.1121,1.2576,4.7771,0.7235,0.7354,1.1139,2.2763,0.6647,0.1345,0.2066,0.1234,1.2123,7.4778,1.1988,2.5744,4.8746,0.1692,0.7723,9.3802,0.5247,0.1443,1.2092,0.594,1.2572,1.5055,3.1278,1.6194,2.1797,0.4579,1.1991,5.1414,3.8255,3.2899,1.0374,0.8583,1.8486,3.1829,1.8422,2.7014,4.058,1.5301,2.1589,1.927,0.6332,0.2393,1.3928,0.131,5.519,4.4447,1.1893,0.4907,2.8215,0.8577,2.0149,5.1544,2.0142,4.2728,6.0815,1.7873,6.0697,0.0426,4.4033,0.3007,0.4805,4.3116,2.4882,0.3125,2.9433,1.622,4.6855,0.5018,1.8208,1.758,4.7121,0.0442,2.9723,0.4521,0.0024,0.8644,3.2564,0.7144,2.4904,3.7837,4.1459,3.8725,5.4881,1.4391,4.6974,4.7362,0.921,0.3102]}
{"prompt":"In 1914 the mansion was put on the market by the estate of Frederick Cox , Richard Henry Cox 's grandson . It was described as `` a brick and stone building , partly stuccoed","text":"In 1914 the mansion was put on the market by the estate of Frederick Cox, Richard Henry Cox's grandson. It was described as `` a brick and stone building, partly stuccoed with gables and an attached clipped gable at the front. The front elevation, having an upper and lower storey, has a range of two floors. the windows of the first storey are small and of simple pattern. The gables, the balconies, and the balcony rails are stuccoed. There is a small garden at the rear and side of the grounds. `` The sale price was \u00a35000. When Cox died in 1938 his family claimed it should be left to the Australian Commonwealth for any Australian who became a veteran and was serving at the end of the war. This was a much discussed question by the war dead during World War II but in the end it was decided to pass on the estate to Cox himself.\nIn 1952 Cox, who lived in London, decided to sell his house. The house on Church Row was purchased by the Australian Government who had inherited the property as a result of a decision by the War Office to give all properties acquired from American countries to the Australian Government.\nThe Government rented the house to Mr G Wilkins when that gentleman took over managing of the Australian War Memorial. A new rear addition was erected in 1954 and it was planned to be occupied when Australia won the World Championship. After the tournament at the Sydney Cricket Ground it was decided that the entire complex must be abandoned and the Government agreed to have the building demolished. The building was demolished on 29 November 1973. Prior to this date the property had in fact been acquired for demolition by the Government in the mid 1970's, presumably with the intention that it would be razed in order to make way for the construction of a new office building at the site.\nThe property was in the possession of a member of the British Royal Family when it was purchased by the War Office in 1914. The current owner, Mr Charles K. Cunniffe, was the son of a Victorian merchant, Henry Cunniffe. After the sale of the property to Mr Cunniffe he decided not to move into it and it has remained unoccupied since.

It is preferred that","text":"Benzodiazepines can be useful for short @ - @ term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that patients be instructed to take these agents at night when they will have a better likelihood of falling asleep.\nAntiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)\nDoxepin (an antidepressant ) has been evaluated as a medication for insomnia in the treatment of PD patients.\nThe dose used for the management of insomnia is 6 mg to 100 mg given 1 hour or 2 hours prior to bed. No reports of overdose or toxicity have been seen with this medication.\nEfficacy\nA review of the literature found no formal research on AEDs for the treatment of sleep problems in PD. There is a lack of controlled studies in sleep deprivation. There have been case studies regarding the use of specific AEDs. Benzodiazepine use is controversial in a PD context. It should be recommended that benzodiazepines be reserved for short-term use. Because of the risk of dependence, a 4-to 6-wk trial is recommended. The side effects with AEDs are not different from those obtained with a placebo.\nConclusion\nIt is difficult to define optimal treatment for insomnia. In patients with PD there are several factors contributing to an insomnia disturbance. There may be medication use, such as, anticonvulsants. Also, PD itself may contribute to insomnia. A patient with PD may be in a state of hyperalogia because of dopaminergic deficits, lack of motivation, and loss of anticipatory pleasure.\nThere are several treatment modalities that could be used for insomnia in PD patients. Psychotherapy (e.g., counseling, hypnotherapy) and behavioral therapy (e.g., stimulus control, timed sleep restriction, sleep hygiene) that are currently being used have not shown any particular benefit in PD. Medications are generally chosen based on which medication is less likely to cause adverse events and has a better side-effect profile. The use of benzodiazepines in PD is controversial. No data suggest that these medications are better than placebo. There are medications currently being investigated which would be expected to alleviate insomnia including melatonin and clonidine.","token_len":461,"entropy":[8.1375,1.7064,0.3363,4.6959,1.965,4.9918,1.1341,5.639,18.5346,6.6497,6.5151,6.9517,6.8074,3.6179,2.9963,1.2864,5.8338,2.8715,9.7871,4.6229,3.0985,1.3731,1.5516,1.7005,2.619,1.0602,3.4269,0.0069,1.7264,2.7633,0.1769,5.4909,1.0849,3.8573,0.5122,6.433,1.7307,3.1675,2.2434,5.185,0.5704,1.9909,4.6437,4.8623,2.6232,4.1995,3.2038,1.2206,4.1619,2.8544,2.0033,1.8584,7.398,0.0883,4.2342,0.0354,0.8728,1.7432,12.6813,5.2246,0.0834,0.0563,0.1325,3.5954,2.9492,2.91,2.7243,0.5653,0.1533,1.4302,5.7748,4.892,2.1539,0.931,1.9644,5.3907,2.9085,7.2433,3.2766,0.6103,5.7366,1.3753,0.7756,6.0405,0.8354,0.9415,1.8387,1.9239,4.2214,0.0461,7.7706,4.224,0.621,2.9669,3.464,4.9918,3.1208,1.7205,2.396,6.1506,0.057,1.2428,0.8473,5.1155,0.8684,4.3838,4.3617,0.1164,6.8619,4.6203,1.6493,4.5716,2.6855,0.2265,2.2057,0.0302,2.1842,3.0575,5.7532,7.5274,0.7075,4.7328,3.0324,4.3037,0.972,0.0368,4.234,3.3256,1.4816,1.2718,0.4446,0.7661,5.3232,2.3361,0.0025,2.3543,3.5888,6.3525,0.319,1.2855,0.576,2.8265,1.6601,8.5736,4.5109,1.9621,3.2329,0.0074,0.9749,2.5272,2.7807,0.3518,0.0053,4.1868,2.2271,1.8737,0.4994,2.2524,3.9421,1.1239,2.0471,2.0166,0.0072,5.3768,1.5441,2.7968,7.0224,5.9998,1.8825,3.1752,2.7716,0.1704,6.751,3.4131,5.8673,1.415,2.7374,0.022,7.1059,2.0737,0.0109,0.1491,2.5435,7.7331,0.024,0.0004,2.0755,3.2001,1.6522,7.0287,1.9206,3.9225,8.919,3.9239,0.7723,3.1922,3.8592,0.3406,5.3971,0.3443,4.9398,0.0009,0.0004,0.6456,0.6695,7.2032,0.1716,3.3191,2.8022,0.1071,1.8729,1.3297,6.0584,1.0265,0.6278,2.3745,0.2044,1.8477,0.6012,3.5804,6.1172,0.4882,5.4855,2.7716,0.4902,4.5691,4.4336,1.6116,1.1811,0.9612,3.0197,5.7756,0.3342,5.8014,2.3227,0.0038,0.2652,0.9933,2.2751,6.6964,0.7451,0.6342,6.7265,0.4628,2.9274,1.7673,0.5648,0.9231,5.3646,0.2152,3.6892,0.469,4.0866,0.0736,3.9452,5.079,3.1732,0.9322,1.1889,1.0786,3.5245,5.0934,0.3989,0.493,4.3285,1.2348,2.4321,2.2708,4.6011,0.0426,5.1721,3.0317,6.1955,0.7499,3.8044,2.9771,0.0971,6.6094,3.3849,1.4541,5.063,0.0054,5.5018,6.6245,2.0732,0.0017,0.0006,0.4263,3.0568,5.3266,0.4934,7.304,7.8337,1.3045,4.4545,0.1265,2.2017,0.929,3.2226,4.277,1.5207,1.103,1.3187,1.9064,4.3255,1.0943,1.2234,0.1126,4.4047,12.8322,1.235,5.1153,0.4354,7.3532,0.0016,0.0004,4.5595,1.8539,5.3005,0.002,4.3502,0.7995,1.5533,5.7574,0.0169,9.7946,0.0092,7.241,0.5448,1.8056,3.816,1.0161,2.0958,5.5305,3.2978,0.0037,1.69,3.2293,0.425,0.8574,1.4594,0.8747,2.0478,0.5844,2.1159,0.2756,6.4597,0.72,3.8652,2.1269,0.0109,0.0007,0.2139,6.9952,0.9393,5.3464,0.9055,0.0561,1.1178,2.5255,4.1515,0.5531,0.4265,0.0297,0.0009,0.0011,0.0064,7.8068,4.0959,1.189,8.3316,4.64,4.2992,0.6471,2.7007,4.4897,1.2927,6.5118,1.7691,4.5457,2.1292,2.4164,4.3216,2.1877,3.6528,1.5929,6.6977,0.9687,1.7744,1.6335,1.1919,5.9779,0.7424,3.047,4.0219,7.3736,2.7821,0.0526,7.4605,3.6044,0.8325,5.7782,2.227,0.0107,1.0195,3.4642,2.6481,2.3461,3.8763,1.8686,2.4709,4.1034,2.092,0.1968,0.0673,0.5658,2.8136,2.4374,0.017,3.0238,0.0029,0.0002,0.1001,1.9983,0.3176,1.4199,3.885,1.3982,5.5122,3.6707,5.0385,0.5531,2.8627,0.7819,1.3774,4.0746,0.8297,1.1806,0.6895,3.1667,1.0409,7.3056,5.4882,2.1052,3.7883,3.9658,3.7006,1.0111,4.6596,0.0253,5.3274,0.5748,6.9282,6.5529,0.029,1.6847,5.9893,1.2488,0.8264,0.4304]}

It is not yet available on online and streaming services.\nThe film was inspired by a controversial book written by Aamir Khan titled \u2018Battle of Gogra\u2019. This book was written in 2015, which is a book that discussed the events in the battle of Gobindgarh.\nAfter the release of the film, the government took action. The film was banned due to a scene in the first 10 seconds of the film in which the army is seen destroying a mosque in Pakistan and saying \u201cthis is how we are going to show democracy in Pakistan.\u201d\nThe same day, the CM of Punjab announced the ban on the movie on Twitter and said that the movie had been banned under the First Information Reports (FIR) initiated against them in the same area.\nIn one of the scenes, the army is seen killing many civilians for which the army troops were criticized.\nHowever, the government has ruled out banning the movie by the Supreme Court or judiciary. They have decided not to take any action and were not worried.\nThis is a situation like a movie and in these circumstances it is not appropriate for the government to ban such a movie. The government does not want to do anything because the movie had been made after the army\u2019s violation of security.\nThe only thing the government of India is looking is to ensure that there is no recurrence of the same violations of the security of citizens. On the other hand, the government has not taken actions on the movie for not violating any laws or regulations of the government.","token_len":462,"entropy":[8.1984,2.3406,6.572,1.6984,0.6464,6.8329,2.1888,0.0779,0.0349,9.7421,0.1949,0.5087,4.8887,3.7746,4.2736,0.0027,9.4017,7.0942,6.0805,0.8143,4.6939,0.3579,0.3296,2.3387,2.8171,4.5476,1.568,7.0875,10.9952,2.5164,4.859,0.0015,5.5351,3.6816,4.4011,3.0145,8.0656,10.471,3.7144,4.3209,5.6352,5.1887,1.9746,3.5483,2.7963,13.628,4.9457,5.7262,1.9228,1.9398,6.5022,2.295,2.0439,0.2206,8.0996,0.5572,0.2289,0.0521,1.0522,0.9611,10.1373,2.9225,0.1868,7.8283,0.2485,0.7745,1.3802,5.0337,7.6355,2.5591,2.1492,3.9224,9.7394,0.2864,6.494,3.1449,0.1246,1.3422,0.4131,3.4733,4.4359,3.8199,0.0908,6.7247,4.7233,1.7526,4.7416,4.8505,0.0602,2.2373,4.4243,2.0627,5.6587,7.5602,1.9563,1.1589,0.5716,0.7748,3.6006,1.8779,7.6258,1.4511,0.519,1.2719,3.714,5.2433,3.9575,3.9193,6.6804,4.7425,1.4202,6.0557,3.0914,2.1166,0.7285,3.7028,5.6206,2.0215,3.4665,2.0685,2.9786,3.3808,4.8046,3.721,2.1509,0.8384,1.6627,4.227,1.756,2.472,1.2114,1.1922,1.04,6.7703,1.189,0.0139,1.9447,0.9798,1.627,0.7622,6.3776,0.6128,3.0397,4.2191,0.9052,3.0147,1.6626,2.6381,4.2801,1.6532,2.8646,5.7586,3.5223,6.5585,2.5831,1.0717,0.6661,1.7391,1.4768,1.4038,7.0692,0.0972,2.0556,5.0956,4.9627,2.7532,0.094,4.9882,1.8828,0.0676,0.0907,3.3793,3.174,5.6916,8.0838,0.7229,6.1347,3.2381,5.012,2.3347,6.8329,2.5248,3.593,0.3765,1.6304,1.9695,1.7651,5.6121,3.2813,2.952,2.6534,2.7781,3.123,2.0596,7.1232,0.7829,5.7386,1.4524,1.8169,4.8158,0.3159,7.686,2.2392,5.9069,0.0212,1.4988,1.0866,4.2474,0.999,5.2438,0.0614,0.5919,3.2081,0.9866,1.525,2.9888,4.0736,1.3548,3.0836,1.3281,2.2709,0.6569,0.9248,5.0032,0.0025,3.5073,3.8646,1.2353,1.5134,3.3953,6.8834,2.6821,0.4789,0.2032,0.9272,2.8264,0.2445,1.4319,2.6603,1.872,1.5836,6.2658,1.1802,4.1284,1.6437,3.8809,2.4239,6.4824,2.6077,0.9155,4.53,0.6484,4.0422,2.0976,2.0739,1.7087,0.1203,6.3585,5.0001,1.9213,1.1965,1.4616,4.8671,4.1279,0.4886,1.3179,5.9557,2.9346,0.6578,1.0042,9.2741,1.2308,1.2935,3.7711,2.1147,2.9733,1.4411,0.4755,1.3095,3.6678,1.8518,2.6319,2.5294,1.2417,1.159,1.9728,2.088,0.7992,0.782,4.1353,0.8279,5.7756,1.854,6.1044,2.7714,0.2667,0.6616,12.0943,4.697,5.9442,2.6891,1.4434,4.6158,5.0552,0.5734,0.4612,2.8431,5.901,0.5682,0.3289,4.589,1.6467,1.0969,1.7554,1.4133,0.5042,3.4737,5.7026,3.0091,5.7976,5.8384,1.3079,4.0312,6.2014,2.1378,7.2181,1.3971,1.1436,3.8455,0.1446,1.0975,2.7729,2.2754,5.836,0.2221,4.0796,0.2611,0.3923,5.1038,1.8467,4.704,0.0271,4.4857,7.8209,0.9478,5.8061,1.1617,3.5398,2.5938,0.0027,3.1389,0.7046,0.2602,3.8543,5.6462,2.0218,5.8504,3.4315,0.3735,3.63,1.4318,1.8817,5.6322,5.8126,3.1768,3.4641,4.3977,4.1466,5.0234,1.6657,2.0468,0.6992,1.3667,3.0547,1.2724,0.9568,0.7485,0.0757,1.7473,4.5051,0.4048,0.8359,0.5295,2.5202,1.0295,4.202,0.1307,0.7708,0.5047,4.514,0.9897,4.9018,1.9554,1.3182,3.819,1.8209,2.7769,4.6639,0.9088,4.738,10.8444,3.9583,1.459,7.7645,0.3114,7.2803,2.4311,0.483,1.4173,5.2205,2.0819,1.6103,0.2713,5.1128,1.7361,2.1029,3.4007,8.4096,1.1324,3.7583,0.423,4.0468,0.5863,0.7124,6.3271,0.169,0.1396,1.0432,4.4618,5.4136,2.3709,1.4931,3.7739,1.3852,5.4771,1.4684,6.7175,0.6102,0.2758,0.0288,0.1035,1.0693,0.6591,2.1639,2.652,2.1826,6.6291,3.8527,0.9021,3.0448,4.0537,5.6652,4.672,2.0867,1.7409,2.0779,1.679,2.5601,0.6356,2.3817,0.7125]}

Although issue 14 made a passing reference to superheroes, the series since developed its own mythology. It has a number of central mysteries, including the origins of Hellblazer, the identity and whereabouts of the otherworldly hero Knull ( which was hinted at in the last issue of issue 15 ) and the possible return of a legendary super villain \u2013 though this is not entirely clear as yet, particularly in the first story arc. The main character is Hellblazer himself, an inquisitive and somewhat eccentric British detective, who has developed a bond with the Hellworld. When the series first began, he had become involved with the case of an anonymous murderer who had been shot in the head and left for dead on a street in New York. At a press conference, he revealed himself by reading a book written by his parents ( who had also died a month earlier ) about \u2018 the art of murder. The mystery of the killing and the identity of the killer are both hinted at in issue 22. Several other mysteries will be hinted at, as well, and there will be the usual plethora of villains and mysteries that accompany any good superhero series. While the first arc takes place in New York ( partly due to the nature of the story as it first emerged, and partly due to the fact the series originally began in the UK in 1984, before expanding to a global audience over the course of its run ), it is unclear where the story will take place in the future, although issues 10-19 take place in England at the beginning of the century \u2013 though this has not yet been confirmed. While the first half of the series does have a definite linear plot, both the second half and the run-up to Issue 100 are still quite fragmentary\nI know, it's a little late to say this, but it isn't too late to say it. This is a great game and well worth the price, and it comes on DVD so you can play the rest of the game. The storyline could have been better but is otherwise a very good game. The game is a fast-paced action game for one or two players that will please everyone. For the price, it's a great buy.","token_len":463,"entropy":[8.6071,2.4264,4.8584,5.4799,3.1494,2.1227,7.7232,2.1076,2.1131,6.0509,2.4038,2.7879,1.4116,6.5534,1.3037,5.1893,5.5786,10.7332,1.1577,0.6248,0.3348,5.6681,12.1018,5.7549,7.2726,2.3937,8.2902,2.31,0.0251,8.1946,1.0492,1.6625,3.3386,9.3939,7.3047,3.0984,0.682,2.8097,2.0466,3.0905,3.5423,2.7682,4.1493,0.0116,6.9453,5.5348,1.2205,1.6466,0.995,2.0877,0.0784,6.2123,0.148,0.0578,0.8312,1.2035,4.8492,3.9045,3.7773,0.0038,1.2362,4.7974,3.3362,4.9073,9.6471,9.1382,3.9638,10.4687,2.589,6.2358,0.3474,0.6337,1.9579,4.2867,0.2069,1.6386,1.1059,3.1271,3.3659,0.1179,0.8417,5.4267,3.6917,0.0746,3.3504,5.2982,5.204,2.1826,6.4578,5.4285,2.9303,1.2794,2.214,5.1156,1.1244,3.4968,6.0571,2.8752,5.6166,2.7627,0.777,3.1978,6.1116,1.1636,0.879,2.5047,3.5885,1.624,2.1409,7.5864,0.0497,0.0359,1.7795,0.5271,4.1047,7.5316,0.0229,0.182,2.3212,4.9459,3.4577,8.5009,3.6167,2.2003,0.8817,1.7979,4.9192,0.6586,5.4817,0.0313,1.3953,4.633,11.9498,3.1787,4.3463,1.8946,3.2465,2.7982,1.5859,0.483,2.4172,2.4513,4.3401,4.3814,0.6986,0.9221,6.4534,0.2775,3.7825,5.3948,5.6678,1.7558,1.2796,1.5555,5.3363,1.7468,0.5382,0.8263,2.5154,3.6421,1.3215,0.0019,3.6911,1.5533,2.6864,1.0538,3.1704,0.2082,0.9871,4.9329,3.9462,4.0422,0.1439,1.5045,1.3128,2.3514,4.1727,6.7863,6.1537,1.2447,1.9549,3.8621,0.0871,2.8028,5.2189,3.8084,4.7309,2.0828,2.83,3.33,4.678,3.9496,1.1671,1.0047,2.1021,15.6779,6.8201,3.0717,8.5792,0.4144,4.2947,0.8868,1.8988,4.7269,1.2022,0.867,6.0862,3.0851,0.6558,4.4609,0.0221,0.3144,0.8698,3.099,3.4937,5.2872,0.2158,0.9575,1.7532,5.1959,1.5251,6.0481,2.6436,3.6267,5.091,0.8713,4.6633,0.077,2.2662,3.2021,0.4257,1.4841,2.7903,3.1175,1.2642,0.3421,4.762,3.8057,6.575,0.0074,5.5649,2.0949,5.1858,2.6688,5.6319,3.8599,4.5271,4.4798,2.4101,0.3271,4.3697,1.2132,3.0651,3.4071,5.7969,0.5402,0.6714,2.1763,0.0451,4.3102,11.4834,2.1607,0.0034,0.7659,5.601,0.0088,0.4022,3.4673,4.1678,1.533,6.2965,5.9182,2.8108,1.2706,0.3917,0.9966,0.0033,0.5632,1.7584,3.8517,2.043,5.5364,2.1397,0.4926,2.4622,2.6847,3.2955,4.7665,2.5114,4.9698,5.7329,0.5775,3.7125,3.4418,0.7998,6.1893,0.5735,1.4248,0.0007,3.168,1.2127,3.9915,2.379,1.4315,4.6148,3.2975,0.9202,2.2449,0.7035,0.9984,0.2407,1.0941,0.638,2.521,2.032,3.4151,5.4606,4.2931,1.6635,3.8922,4.6364,0.0952,0.7803,4.678,4.7127,0.5162,1.6884,0.1502,0.3815,5.503,4.9198,3.4916,2.7731,3.4567,1.0959,1.1766,0.1144,0.582,0.4864,4.607,1.2071,2.2746,5.4608,0.1532,0.8495,1.0154,4.7172,2.539,1.3875,6.3568,8.7879,2.5825,0.7267,5.6803,1.6781,1.227,1.3346,0.7187,0.574,6.9922,1.2079,1.1142,0.0925,3.5812,7.9728,1.8409,4.7582,3.5522,8.5541,0.0437,8.5216,7.0046,4.0026,2.1061,2.772,0.6176,2.3217,2.3989,3.193,1.0601,2.23,1.2824,0.52,0.0674,2.6571,5.3413,0.0007,2.5448,0.1586,0.5491,2.1196,3.1232,1.0291,3.4425,1.0843,1.4701,3.9689,6.8062,3.2133,5.9416,0.4935,1.7479,3.7441,2.9173,1.6925,2.0799,5.4968,4.7457,10.57,5.3497,1.3495,0.6251,3.1925,2.6941,4.5925,0.2779,0.4727,3.289,1.8746,2.0744,5.6321,6.3559,1.6074,0.6466,2.6045,5.3662,3.2486,6.606,2.5708,2.6101,1.8229,2.7916,1.27,1.8007,3.9559,1.486,2.7482,5.1824,2.41,0.0082,2.0694,0.7717,4.9072,4.9488,2.8019,0.0985,0.2647,2.5904,3.2397,6.2915,3.0076,1.3954,5.3076,1.9407,3.7379,0.6967,1.0929,0.9177,1.2368,1.6256,4.7997,1.0618]}

{"prompt":"Only one in five Croatian Jews survived the Holocaust of World War II .

Between 1948 and 1952, nearly one half of the surviving members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to the U.S.A.; many went to New York or Los Angeles. In New York they settled mainly in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Since the 1970s Croatian Jewry has developed an identity and presence in the fields of business, education, philanthropy and social work, and political activity. Croatia is also home to a considerable international Jewish community. In April 1996, the Croatian government adopted a law on the Jewish community of Croatia. Two new places of Jewish congregations in Croatia (in Split and in Zvornik) opened respectively in 1997 and 2006. A large Jewish Community of Zagreb, a number of Jewish Associations, a Jewish Youth Club, and a Jewish Radio (Jewish Voice of Croatia) emerged in the next dozen years. The largest Jewish community in Croatia is on the Adriatic coast, where approximately one third of the population has been assimilated into the Croatian culture. The minority of Jews in the central mountains are concentrated in Velebit and Pomer region. Many Jews are also located along the coast of Po\u017eevar Bay. Despite the relatively small size and ethnic composition of the Jewish community, Croatian Jews have been active in Croatian political life. In 1993, the Croatian Jewish community successfully ran for the first time a candidate on the Croatian Parliament, \u017deljka \u010cerm\u00e1k. The Croatian Government also granted Jewish Communities the right to establish Jewish cemeteries, which have so far been refused by the Serbian authorities.

When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes gave her letter of introduction to a young Spanish lady named Pilar. They lived together for some time, and got engaged in 1962. Mercedes, who had a background in film-making, wanted to start a career in cinema. After some experience, including an appearance as a presenter on a TV documentary, she decided to apply to film schools. Her experience during the Spanish Civil War would help her in her studies. In 1967, she finished her studies and worked for a German film production. Her first short movie was directed by Fernando Trueba. The first of a number of awards would follow. The screenplay, The Guiding Light ( El Seguidor ) was co-written with Garc\u00eda Marquez and Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias.\nShe co-starred with Pedro Almod\u00f3var in El Deseo, the first film the director created while still living in Spain. The movie has a great soundtrack, with a theme song by Joan Manuel Serrat, and a scene where she walks along the sea. El Deseo was based on a novel by Pedro Juan Guti\u00e9rrez. The title refers to the dreamed-up desire of a wealthy socialite to become a director, and to a female agent hired to get her in touch with people who were able to offer advice and help. She had a film deal with Spain's main film production company, but it was not a success in terms of box-office sales. The company decided to release her films through their home video operations.\nThe following year, she became a screenwriter for her first feature film. Her second, Luc\u00eda y el sexo, dealt with women's sexuality in Cuban history. She wrote the script with her sister, Pilar. She is currently involved with a Spanish television series, El Comisario.\nHer marriage to the American novelist, Roger McGough ended in divorce in 1977. Their daughter, Andrea, now lives in the US. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez became a widower in 2006, when his other son, Gonzalo, died at age 28.","token_len":464,"entropy":[9.0539,2.573,4.9059,1.4372,0.1775,0.005,8.7065,10.8184,6.4652,11.6371,1.4616,5.8486,2.5583,0.282,2.8397,4.8468,9.8868,2.8041,4.2684,0.3892,5.9791,1.1808,2.0433,0.928,2.5571,4.3031,4.1745,1.9874,0.7524,3.5423,2.9001,2.7484,6.2413,0.6406,6.2225,4.4226,0.5301,5.4556,2.4402,0.8162,3.7216,4.3399,1.6919,7.2842,1.1538,2.5846,1.6111,2.8429,3.5486,4.6543,3.9131,1.8089,5.4969,2.0057,2.0411,3.221,5.4945,1.1329,0.8939,4.0581,0.2131,1.256,1.2217,5.6342,2.9299,1.2098,6.0132,0.4776,3.1723,3.9989,1.2298,1.5103,2.7375,7.2316,0.1051,4.7237,4.3746,0.183,0.3497,5.3109,0.2074,3.636,0.9148,2.9859,0.7617,3.8304,1.2588,3.8467,3.6908,5.533,1.8071,7.237,4.284,3.0128,2.3476,1.2035,6.6644,0.8516,2.2407,2.657,3.0673,0.9297,0.7681,1.5843,0.2377,5.0546,1.1415,3.3151,2.2789,0.9106,3.3522,4.897,6.9107,1.57,3.7362,1.1347,0.0218,4.8252,2.4195,0.6297,2.3351,1.1708,3.7874,0.9525,2.7657,3.7122,0.5386,0.7062,6.1032,0.4745,2.1697,1.442,4.2281,1.9149,1.4984,4.8944,1.8723,2.8895,4.6496,3.2796,2.1967,5.7657,4.864,1.4109,3.9128,0.0797,7.215,11.8246,5.7599,1.9887,2.5367,3.6542,3.142,3.8728,4.4542,0.0529,6.9211,5.4612,3.9771,1.1009,2.8276,6.9129,3.1248,4.6968,7.4261,2.6373,0.6799,2.2606,12.8705,6.9791,2.816,5.5125,3.463,3.5701,0.5862,5.7682,0.0122,0.8733,1.6905,7.9586,0.0005,6.2946,0.9271,1.3309,6.4867,4.2102,0.0492,0.5331,0.0064,7.7978,1.2911,1.0154,0.7337,2.9785,6.4564,6.7053,0.0202,2.0988,0.0043,0.8109,4.6242,1.9732,0.2907,0.4493,0.0002,1.2634,4.831,5.575,10.5384,4.3575,2.7961,2.9232,2.0455,2.4669,6.279,2.7274,5.3539,6.0648,3.3902,2.9023,0.3123,1.677,0.2966,2.1215,3.0808,4.4759,2.7526,4.0943,2.9218,1.3649,2.5032,2.1458,6.4464,1.7153,0.7384,5.8086,7.4018,8.5833,6.3363,2.753,1.2946,1.7021,5.2447,1.9227,2.186,5.7874,3.4395,1.0513,4.9588,1.5195,5.7455,0.7938,0.0529,0.0007,1.3387,4.2988,0.1372,1.6422,2.0748,0.3348,4.5706,7.7511,7.746,0.1646,0.0001,0.0,1.441,1.9326,4.4559,4.2001,0.022,0.7945,15.3734,1.3077,0.2332,10.6901,0.8522,2.014,5.3888,7.5364,0.0364,0.8786,2.7254,0.6378,4.1622,2.0775,1.3517,2.4504,5.1415,6.1918,4.9276,4.7871,1.3041,3.9256,1.078,3.4979,3.256,0.1322,4.9965,1.6379,2.8002,6.0496,0.0735,4.1552,3.6254,1.6045,1.401,0.7743,2.7203,3.0734,1.8205,5.7426,5.4126,0.2817,6.647,0.3199,5.6269,1.0567,3.1113,0.2191,0.7457,5.2052,2.2954,0.5717,2.6121,2.5911,1.2108,4.2811,6.4689,0.0011,4.295,1.8216,0.0002,3.1633,0.4495,2.5219,5.189,4.087,0.2307,5.5459,1.8779,5.0929,4.601,3.019,4.9301,2.9936,7.4573,1.0178,1.7089,2.792,3.7242,0.2092,0.3427,0.8565,3.4372,1.103,5.2043,0.1388,1.1934,3.8247,1.0032,1.4774,0.6499,2.5283,2.5655,2.4413,3.8018,7.8429,1.6593,7.1724,6.1601,10.5064,0.7626,1.4661,7.8983,0.066,5.1549,1.2636,3.3053,1.411,9.2861,4.6678,0.5391,1.5899,3.1387,1.7701,1.9719,3.104,2.4085,3.0755,1.1353,5.6685,0.1391,1.7021,1.9654,4.5922,3.0674,4.6172,0.8123,2.1182,3.9648,3.8728,1.8506,1.9071,3.086,5.0878,7.0487,1.6643,2.2952,1.1155,2.8716,7.2281,0.3833,4.2322,4.9375,5.0032,2.7154,5.7427,8.4805,4.8252,5.5542,0.5012,0.4869,1.1308,3.4969,0.3807,5.0839,2.1703,0.8158,6.4079,0.7833,4.2886,1.9548,0.4767,2.878,2.2672,0.8084,6.2094,0.0045,2.3998,0.0066,0.0025,0.0008,4.3607,1.6539,5.5208,0.0307,0.7365,4.7281,1.6291,2.6735,3.8064,6.6348,2.6332,0.836,6.1398,0.0966,0.6629,1.683,3.7069,1.8124,5.1634,0.2423]}

He said : Months before leaving my office, I received an e-mail informing that I will only get 4.1% of my salary because of a new ownership change. \u2026 It is a real loss in moral and financial terms for me. KFC is going to have to think of some other way of paying me.\nFollowing his retrenchment, he worked as an assistant manager in several banks. A personal friend told him that he should try to teach English as a second language, and Khoo has since taught English in schools in the east and south-west of Singapore. He received his diploma in English language teaching at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 2007.\nWhen asked about his involvement in the Singbuzz group, Khoo said : I never wanted to be part of it. I did not agree with the way the new owners ( group ) wanted to run the company. There was not one thing I did or spoke about that I did not get my boss, Mr Lee Howe, to veto. At the time I said, the boss should not say to you what you have to say to him.\nIn 2012, Singbuzz was given a temporary licence to operate from 5pm to 8am, and Khoo was told he was barred from any further involvement in Singbuzz. He said he was not happy with the decision because he had been part of the Singbuzz team that decided the move. He had also been involved in the creation of Singbuzz\u2019s website. \u201d My view is that I have been given an ultimatum to either join them or be kicked out. If I did not agree, there was nothing I could do about it. It is sad that the people from Singbuzz took the decision.\nSingbuzz group, however, said that only the CEO of Singbuzz Media Group ( the parent company ) has final word on the issues relating to the company. Mr Lee Howe said : \u201cI cannot be in this role to be biased. You can see who we have been dealing with.

{"prompt":"In animal cells , two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support : The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope , while less organized support","text":"In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support : The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support structures may be found along the chromatin fiber structure. In the present study the distribution of intermediate filaments in human blastocysts was studied in relation to the development of the embryonic cell nuclei to the morula stage. Although there are some data on the presence of intermediate filaments in the early mammalian embryo, no reports have been published concerning the expression of intermediate filaments at the morula stage. The appearance of intermediate filaments as an integral part of the cell structure is one of the fundamental morphological events in embryogenesis due to the involvement of intermediate filaments in cell shape and movement. In all the blastocysts studied, intermediate filaments were present in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of three types of intermediate filaments : intermediate length filaments, the desmosomal intermediate filament and microfilaments. Intermediate length filaments were observed in the cytoplasm of both cells of each blastocyst. These filaments were present in the peripheral cytoplasm in the embryonic cells at the early blastomere stage, a situation which then persisted throughout the morula stage, suggesting a relationship between their appearance and the beginning of cellular organization. The desmosomal intermediate filament appeared late in the morula, at the blastocyst stage, and was mainly confined to its desmoid cells. The microfilaments were observed throughout the cytoplasm of blastocysts, but their distribution remained stable throughout the morula stage. This result indicates that the morphological transition occurring at the morula stage has no effect on the fine structure of intermediate filaments in the cells of the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. A correlation was also found between the appearance of intermediate filaments and the appearance of desmosomal junctions in both embryonic cells and desmoid cells, a situation which persisted during development. Thus, these results show a close relationship between the fine structure of desmosomal junctions and that of intermediate filaments and confirm the presence of several morphological changes to accompany development from the blastomere to the morula stage.","token_len":465,"entropy":[9.644,4.6153,0.4333,6.0759,8.8943,0.6075,7.5285,5.1826,0.0041,6.6452,2.1218,5.0495,2.1256,7.6355,2.7509,10.3256,6.467,6.448,6.6976,0.9235,4.4304,2.4319,6.4718,6.8066,9.0507,5.1773,0.8171,5.691,7.5697,0.3911,0.2883,7.789,1.5679,2.7199,10.0382,6.2799,9.3298,2.6948,5.1299,1.276,2.8702,3.612,0.1799,8.5686,1.5248,6.6535,5.4318,0.7687,2.3118,1.7347,4.3118,0.4259,3.3395,6.1597,0.125,5.735,0.1309,0.0004,2.0754,4.742,9.4922,0.3255,0.0984,1.2652,3.2438,1.9556,4.3991,0.0059,1.1098,5.6255,0.1462,1.5971,6.3932,3.6557,5.7939,0.1063,5.8866,2.1838,12.3575,4.2506,7.0907,1.0038,5.0242,3.4558,1.5851,3.1897,5.4702,1.8533,0.5703,5.7479,0.1589,2.7753,0.1252,0.0002,0.345,1.8471,4.147,5.5752,2.7685,0.4439,3.1891,5.8837,1.2367,0.1158,1.1827,2.7341,0.6078,4.3747,0.336,3.227,0.0426,0.0005,4.2371,0.8665,4.0307,0.0725,0.331,0.597,1.8855,6.0771,0.0652,1.5423,0.0412,0.0008,4.6765,3.7976,5.4787,0.2835,0.004,0.463,3.4394,3.4314,2.1009,4.9789,0.399,0.0816,4.5374,7.6985,0.1231,5.938,1.7407,3.1206,0.1938,7.919,0.0064,0.547,5.1967,0.0089,5.0373,0.4157,0.0013,0.4578,3.6195,6.9778,1.3363,6.6629,0.3711,2.1641,5.4124,2.5051,7.5643,0.0138,0.0379,2.2349,0.5758,3.5522,0.018,0.001,1.0553,1.4675,1.0912,1.2973,2.6475,1.8975,2.2569,0.4268,5.9367,0.0161,0.0045,0.0004,1.3264,9.4599,1.1252,0.6146,0.0135,1.8024,2.3099,0.826,0.0322,3.7871,3.5873,0.0223,1.147,0.0452,0.0009,3.5791,5.7029,8.3649,0.9843,0.0014,0.8006,3.5686,10.673,6.4957,4.7698,4.5401,2.5851,1.6461,7.3985,3.3933,0.4653,0.3861,6.0554,1.8199,0.0605,0.0013,1.363,4.4744,0.6708,1.2668,4.4772,0.0114,0.0039,0.0006,1.6713,4.7266,3.4027,4.0781,3.457,2.31,0.0047,0.0714,0.9675,3.0424,0.4389,0.0009,1.2119,4.1269,0.5109,1.1862,8.3799,5.0697,0.0174,0.0036,0.0016,4.0697,1.4882,3.7377,3.3136,5.1084,0.9727,3.7452,6.5213,9.8414,3.2469,1.0113,1.6796,6.0253,5.7911,1.8124,7.7725,5.3684,3.7096,0.4519,8.0121,0.2389,0.3823,2.7605,4.2375,2.5642,5.4755,0.3097,4.3323,3.8515,0.342,0.8974,7.5224,0.1384,5.5152,4.3964,0.3086,1.4013,5.0416,0.011,0.0551,2.0788,0.1901,4.49,7.3929,0.1988,0.5892,4.5279,0.0661,3.1326,3.2031,0.626,5.995,2.4802,0.0837,1.0288,0.5949,0.8488,1.5975,5.699,4.1142,0.0706,4.1727,10.3381,3.8518,1.6646,4.9939,0.7632,1.1256,0.4718,0.0384,0.0644,1.2643,3.8805,5.0262,0.1032,4.2881,0.0011,0.0024,0.0006,1.0239,2.9217,0.0404,0.151,1.6409,2.1265,3.3716,3.0337,2.7662,3.4177,1.7712,0.2487,1.5772,0.0495,0.5102,0.3243,3.6721,3.8613,2.2951,0.1749,0.8487,6.1881,0.1457,4.9245,5.1976,1.1636,0.2716,1.27,0.0364,0.0482,3.7848,4.5862,2.8612,0.065,0.3566,10.0322,0.8177,0.3345,6.0409,0.0488,0.0004,1.8796,0.5758,3.4365,1.1078,0.8399,7.9062,3.2782,5.5606,1.7135,0.5086,0.6875,0.0714,0.0528,0.3498,4.2454,6.2637,2.3573,2.1947,1.0606,0.1097,0.335,2.8273,0.225,1.1546,0.1028,0.0007,0.5206,0.3327,3.8744,0.0647,7.0046,0.1241,0.1371,8.5413,0.0278,1.172,5.4089,3.6144,1.7066,0.4741,10.1447,0.4317,0.4456,0.1874,2.2827,4.4087,3.1061,0.5047,2.9417,3.121,5.2523,0.9501,4.5344,0.1465,3.9827,1.8018,3.3437,3.5949,3.9493,0.8945,0.0894,0.3645,9.5988,0.203,0.1371,3.7959,0.2853,0.0552,1.7774,0.0015,0.2529,4.106,0.2353,2.428,0.0334,0.0007,3.4017,6.8767,0.642,3.6008,0.0343,5.7104,3.8742,0.062,1.7387,5.4707,6.741,4.1801,5.8445,1.5659,1.5961,3.2499,0.0111,2.2067,0.2833,1.2558,0.0504,0.2008,0.1368]}

{"prompt":"Roman Catholic Church opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage , as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by direct and intentional acts (","text":"Roman Catholic Church opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by direct and intentional acts (e.g. sterilisation). This stance is also known as the traditionalist position and is supported by many Catholic bishops.\nThe Catholic Church holds to a number of doctrines associated with traditional morality, including sexual abstinence on a moral level and the rejection and restriction of sexual freedom and contraception that might reduce the chance of conception, as well as sexual fidelity, as a norm for marital sexuality. In contrast, the Church has long supported the practice of abortion, but in the past its position was more nuanced. In recent decades, however, its stance has been one of strict opposition to abortion, despite the growing number of exceptions permitted.\nThe Church has also long held beliefs on sexual ethics and its doctrine on pornography and homosexuality. With regard to the latter, these have changed in recent decades. Although the Church's early positions on homosexuality were ambivalent and complex, it considered homosexuality to be sinful under all circumstances and condemned all forms of homosexual activity and relationships. However, in the 1970s, the Church published a document stating that it \u201chad received\u201d the position of Pope Pius XII concerning homosexuality. In 1981, Pope John Paul II declared that \u201con certain questions of doctrine concerning the nature of man and human sexuality, the Church has progressed in thought\u201d. Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed this position and encouraged Catholics to accept the Church's teaching on homosexuality. Pope Francis in 2013, said that the position of the Pope on homosexuality would be revised upon his return to Rome, if he decided his position on the matter still needed to be revised.\n\nMorality in the Philippines\n\nMorality in modern-day the Philippines has changed drastically because of the social and cultural influences from the U.S. and other countries around the world. The government and law enforcement continue to make efforts to eradicate all forms of illegal and immoral practices. One reason for this is to protect children who are vulnerable to a multitude of exploitative practices. However, one of the most significant consequences of the changing view of morality in the Philippines is the inability to provide accurate public information on sex and sexuality due to strict religious and moral controls on media and education.","token_len":466,"entropy":[8.4914,1.4519,8.4552,4.1501,4.2129,0.0025,3.9776,3.3248,5.2608,0.5378,0.1712,1.2817,3.7006,1.2109,0.0421,3.6268,3.1449,2.5618,3.4437,0.6151,1.5702,10.931,0.4245,7.2805,4.2509,3.244,0.5681,2.4357,2.1159,7.2957,3.6074,4.4105,3.4123,4.3743,2.2016,0.0014,0.0002,2.243,7.8873,2.8312,1.4324,3.331,5.8788,0.9404,3.0279,4.6896,0.0843,1.4864,5.7302,2.5911,1.0339,3.0218,0.9903,2.9398,0.1184,2.2698,2.3035,2.5911,1.1789,0.8751,9.5127,1.713,0.213,4.8283,4.2694,1.5561,3.5225,0.0023,4.3718,6.7753,0.0048,4.282,3.3781,1.2741,0.9713,5.7383,3.2428,7.1084,2.8814,3.9326,0.7307,1.2271,1.3952,5.4549,4.8361,5.1464,0.0228,2.0762,6.324,2.933,5.7853,5.8601,6.2416,6.2913,1.1307,4.7715,0.045,1.8439,2.9511,2.2391,0.1143,0.0019,4.7774,4.3011,2.3093,2.8378,1.8303,5.4107,1.9446,6.0035,6.6119,0.3676,3.0004,3.0938,0.4728,1.1155,1.6017,2.5902,4.8845,3.1097,1.2177,3.9456,0.033,4.4711,1.3772,4.1513,3.2517,1.6197,1.8502,5.3392,1.0045,2.3639,2.8414,3.068,1.0487,1.8467,4.2824,1.3851,0.543,1.8515,0.0017,3.6437,2.7802,0.2416,2.1489,6.03,0.3348,4.2499,2.2243,0.1284,1.9119,1.2889,4.6389,1.2301,4.3745,1.942,0.0211,6.7484,6.3757,3.0823,0.9178,1.5529,1.6393,1.7656,1.5847,4.2447,3.1287,6.3712,4.2035,3.6907,2.8963,1.3225,4.7197,5.0065,1.1699,7.4666,1.4891,3.4046,0.5625,6.4393,1.7929,0.0044,2.0741,3.3001,0.2091,4.4481,3.1689,4.971,2.349,0.4997,1.125,1.1278,3.9902,1.1655,0.3515,2.5226,6.2368,3.2174,0.7605,2.6771,1.3524,6.6952,0.0053,2.312,7.9423,0.122,2.0819,7.3344,2.2689,0.9223,0.0924,4.3253,5.5246,3.2532,0.3884,1.4358,3.8439,2.5149,0.4249,0.0046,2.719,1.2467,3.3843,5.2275,0.8975,3.6561,0.0135,1.8021,1.2175,2.5958,0.034,0.9022,1.2649,0.2378,5.7327,1.0342,3.7821,4.6242,0.1904,2.5906,14.9376,6.8621,7.3499,5.2678,12.7829,7.042,1.9689,4.7578,0.6849,4.7609,2.6075,0.0024,0.4658,4.9231,1.7951,1.2059,2.206,4.7668,0.207,1.7094,1.9852,0.0544,0.0387,3.4063,0.3501,6.058,0.5136,6.1246,6.7171,4.6643,1.0861,5.1035,4.7461,1.6209,3.0414,0.4029,3.6692,0.9369,4.9884,0.6448,0.8435,1.0999,0.4368,1.9343,9.7922,1.9199,7.8071,2.9312,1.975,2.7198,3.2516,2.6566,0.1729,4.4111,0.0013,1.5223,0.2598,3.6749,5.9255,2.6093,0.1954,4.3677,1.0097,0.998,0.0474,2.7291,0.9944,1.3737,1.0374,2.7654,1.6058,3.9438,3.2206,3.6519,5.9531,0.4581,1.4688,5.9506,0.5755,0.287,4.935,1.6678,1.0457,4.1385,1.034,5.6266,5.974,1.9343,2.6645,0.5566,1.3673,2.3827,5.4604,1.1254,5.6554,7.2538,1.6654,1.0181,1.1947,0.5568,6.8591,5.1402,0.925,0.0818,4.4387,0.2599,0.5503,7.3279,9.6537,0.1759,2.8491,1.203,7.6221,0.4429,0.0002,2.7729,0.0822,0.8209,8.2104,2.1503,0.0027,2.0211,0.0311,1.9315,3.3169,3.3868,5.4884,0.0867,0.6906,5.3159,0.8203,1.9004,5.383,5.57,1.0303,6.007,0.0416,0.0111,0.3229,0.9766,1.5294,1.696,4.5572,0.0303,0.1375,0.3237,1.7198,4.8246,2.809,4.3933,0.4263,6.7106,0.0355,5.0818,2.5747,0.15,2.3143,3.9785,0.1773,0.0014,3.0577,2.4571,0.7747,2.0161,1.3564,5.5151,4.7387,0.4878,0.4802,0.8005,5.2784,2.2019,3.5398,4.4052,0.7002,3.0977,0.8831,5.2748,5.8381,0.0007,7.0003,0.1145,1.8998,1.3935,3.1519,0.0086,4.7572,0.9623,0.0284,1.0155,2.3278,4.4217,0.1078,1.144,5.6906,7.6042,0.8653,1.0557,0.9205,0.1967,0.196,0.4056,0.9822,6.3565,1.3858,3.9412,4.7858,5.7541,1.2449,1.6993,4.4582,1.9159,1.8542,6.9281,0.0052,6.621,4.3109,1.1372,2.3251,5.8191,2.2586,5.3175,1.2417,3.9583,0.5684]}
{"prompt":"Townsend designed his two main projects , the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material , as counterparts . Strapping Young Lad 's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres","text":"Townsend designed his two main projects, the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material, as counterparts. Strapping Young Lad's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres and styles ; many musicians have commented on its difficulty in classification. Townsend experimented with styles such as extreme metal and early hard rock, but ultimately found that the style itself was very loose. He referred to the album as \" not rock, not hard rock, but not metal either \" and the music as \" not black metal but not metal \".\nThe music featured Townsend playing guitar, singing and writing songs. The album featured Townsend experimenting with his tone by singing on the choruses of a few of the songs and by using harmonies with his vocalist Jim Guthrie and drummer David Christy. As for Townsend's guitar style, it was very aggressive, with riffing and soloing on songs in a style similar to many of his earlier work. Townsend used a lot of distortion and his vocals were very close to death growling, unlike his later work which featured clean singing and lyrical themes.\nStrapping Young Lad reached its greatest commercial success with the hit single \"Walk Away My Girlfriend \", which peaked at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1982. Also, in contrast to his earlier solo work, the album featured Townsend working with a lot of guest musicians, including Billy Cobham, Chris Reeves and The Jimi Hendrix Experience, who contributed to \" Strapping Young Lad \", a cover version of Hendrix's classic song. For the album, Townsend also hired Greg Lake, who had previously recorded a version of the song with Jimi Hendrix and Rory Gallagher.\nAlthough the album received many favourable reviews, it did not sell very well. Critic David Ritz of The Star-Ledger noted that the album was \" not as memorable or enduring as Lovedrive and the subsequent albums of the period, but it still contains some great songs \". His companion writer Jeff L. Walker also praised the album's musical content and stated that \" there are plenty of groovy rock songs as well as more traditional hard rock songs, from the aggressive \" Walk Away My Girlfriend \", the less abrasive \" My Only Friend \" and Townsend's guitar work is still as explosive as on Lovedrive \".","token_len":466,"entropy":[11.4063,10.5704,3.6615,7.1667,5.3644,3.2979,2.0469,2.01,11.6208,9.638,5.2131,9.1227,6.7547,3.5302,3.9601,4.2681,7.7409,0.2794,5.6376,5.8296,0.9414,2.8852,12.0258,3.7605,3.6116,0.0258,0.1329,0.0606,3.3544,4.6455,2.2684,3.0652,6.9917,0.5327,0.053,7.0941,4.1852,6.1726,1.9115,3.9048,10.948,5.8288,5.9287,4.7569,6.1416,0.5065,2.3404,6.282,1.1168,11.2815,1.836,12.5173,7.355,0.1385,6.0807,2.1033,0.0022,5.6051,1.0922,1.5993,5.8989,6.1471,0.4799,1.0051,1.362,4.097,2.7267,1.7241,1.9175,3.5035,5.6662,0.636,4.1179,5.3121,1.9655,2.2839,7.3194,0.0329,1.8249,4.7913,0.3039,1.0432,8.607,5.9903,3.8764,3.1019,2.4511,0.4416,1.9046,1.4944,3.6505,3.525,4.3057,1.8717,1.247,3.8085,4.4924,2.6478,0.9608,2.7574,6.2049,0.106,3.0691,1.6489,1.5981,4.4153,1.5949,5.1471,3.7645,3.5732,9.5909,3.879,2.6914,1.3761,5.2853,1.5887,4.6368,2.6804,1.384,2.0265,1.8545,2.8695,4.6012,6.6407,0.0614,3.4736,7.5161,5.1104,4.3728,3.8952,1.7666,8.5401,1.0618,0.041,1.5711,3.6196,3.3337,2.0466,0.8796,0.5618,2.8983,3.8207,2.7028,8.0889,0.0011,5.0399,2.1943,2.5286,4.2024,6.7764,5.792,0.0202,3.3797,2.555,4.4941,10.636,0.5835,4.6624,3.5182,4.0185,0.4703,3.809,5.4637,0.1861,2.1444,0.718,4.3316,5.4763,1.6325,2.3482,7.847,1.2337,1.2445,5.5046,0.3515,3.4266,4.4181,4.9807,2.8519,5.0199,2.7052,0.0112,6.2442,1.1428,0.4413,2.4121,1.4764,0.3456,3.6373,3.6959,1.7189,3.9235,0.013,4.4674,1.1689,5.2353,2.4007,0.858,2.9132,5.0141,0.0907,5.933,10.8046,0.5822,2.2896,7.5974,2.0096,2.5438,0.9642,3.5987,1.7083,7.5781,5.5624,0.8369,8.4003,0.0095,4.0163,0.2926,1.0453,5.8813,0.0463,0.0128,0.0031,6.8986,2.145,4.8588,6.1784,0.4816,1.9972,1.1053,4.6851,1.6927,0.7515,8.1924,2.9267,7.1947,6.2265,0.0785,4.7339,0.9984,2.3824,0.0526,0.3918,2.8191,0.1362,0.0822,2.0757,5.445,0.099,0.5601,1.8324,4.5823,4.6365,0.3488,6.6899,1.7852,2.3041,7.9166,0.0597,1.4414,0.8954,3.9832,0.6974,0.2968,1.4108,1.2952,1.4215,2.1439,5.6087,1.3728,2.274,3.9952,0.1566,7.0563,1.1035,1.4847,1.0961,5.9301,6.3379,3.8575,0.6555,4.7467,8.1986,1.2167,5.6458,7.2229,2.81,0.0225,0.0012,4.6499,2.4382,2.2619,4.5642,1.5316,3.5814,9.5694,0.0206,0.0128,0.0125,2.0835,3.5653,4.0726,3.6426,0.0974,7.0013,0.0004,0.1269,3.2423,2.5929,3.0116,5.7182,1.4321,3.2392,0.884,1.0783,3.1833,6.6752,7.0251,8.3641,1.2821,1.405,2.2219,2.1855,3.5694,2.3983,3.4246,0.1547,0.949,0.8395,2.3344,4.3257,1.9547,0.1747,0.0005,2.0548,11.32,5.1129,0.8416,1.1295,4.5333,1.288,1.2694,4.6468,4.4293,5.103,0.0444,0.6006,1.4221,2.8504,0.3,3.5423,2.8555,0.0656,1.0365,9.7228,0.8516,4.7802,5.6375,6.0599,4.2184,2.0403,6.3548,2.3709,0.579,0.0022,3.0075,0.5635,1.3641,0.9946,1.289,0.8543,4.4935,2.5767,5.6773,2.6763,7.5463,0.1291,8.6426,5.1456,7.3355,2.8234,2.7796,5.3965,3.6678,2.5931,1.987,4.9246,1.8695,1.0785,1.3469,2.7544,5.4244,1.1598,3.2649,2.0374,6.5294,4.9837,8.0436,5.6535,5.918,4.968,3.5596,6.0206,2.9608,3.6328,0.2794,0.2417,2.4187,4.5956,3.3946,1.5593,3.3719,0.4097,0.9613,4.5632,1.6514,3.3822,0.0831,7.6512,1.7254,4.371,0.6838,5.8432,0.2074,0.2401,4.516,4.3515,3.3699,0.1039,0.6889,2.0738,5.5023,1.5633,7.9221,4.8849,5.0183,0.0885,0.3253,0.0405,0.0024,1.1736,3.1551,5.977,4.9202,0.0034,0.1008,4.969,6.9442,1.2046,1.6164,0.3578,7.6444,0.102,5.9319,2.0936,7.6709,2.7868,4.1191,6.2913,0.4408,6.4997,4.1802,0.0427,0.0006,1.7289]}

It moved generally northeast before becoming subtropical and then dissipating on November 1 near","text":"Jose was a weak and short @ - @ lived tropical storm that formed far from land on October 29. It moved generally northeast before becoming subtropical and then dissipating on November 1 near the Philippines.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nA tropical wave first organized over waters off the northern coast of South Africa on September 27. In an area of reduced relative vorticity, the wave strengthened and attained its first tropical cyclone status at 18:00 UTC on October 2 when its centre was located about 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) east of Cape Town. After rapidly intensifying, Jose reached peak sustained winds of 115\u00a0km\/h (75\u00a0mph) before weakening to its minimum intensity at 00:00 UTC on October 3. While still classified as a tropical depression, most meteorologists viewed the winds as only moderately sustained, and the system moved away from land in a relatively easterly direction, continuing to weaken. \nShortly after reaching its landfall near Cape Town, the depression weakened slightly and gradually drifted north-northeast at only 4 to 7 knots (8 to 12\u00a0km\/h; 5 to 9\u00a0mph) in the first half of October before the strongest winds shifted to the northwest and northeast once again. While Jose was still considered a tropical depression, the best location to estimate its position was between the northern end of the Cape of Good Hope and the eastern end of the Mozambique Channel. By 18:00 UTC on October 6, the system was moving north-northwest at 14 knots (25\u00a0km\/h; 17\u00a0mph). By this time, Jose was near the eastern tip of the Mozambique Channel and the circulation became narrower. The strongest winds fell on the eastern and southeastern tips, where winds reached a peak of 72\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km\/h) around 06:00 UTC on October 9. Jose then moved north-northwest across the Mozambique Channel, and eventually weakened further inland to become a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on October 12. The depression moved into Mozambique the next day and weakened further on October 13: Jose was officially no longer classified as a tropical system around 00:00 UTC on October 14. By this time, the depression had passed into the Indian Ocean, where it dissipated on November 1.","token_len":469,"entropy":[5.2814,2.7072,8.044,4.1949,4.6215,12.2891,8.9533,6.3802,13.0015,13.2605,2.4387,3.6708,7.1072,8.079,2.2747,5.323,3.2908,5.2353,3.4359,2.1198,3.2991,4.5595,10.3817,4.3251,5.7559,3.9369,6.4752,0.0021,0.0099,2.2816,2.6913,6.3811,1.6266,3.1846,1.3543,1.8792,6.2766,1.5942,4.9398,0.484,2.447,0.0054,6.7307,0.0691,2.262,9.6232,1.5508,0.0003,3.8747,2.7972,7.188,7.4031,9.6252,3.8545,8.22,1.7654,0.8492,4.4677,1.4269,0.1696,3.0598,3.6026,1.9164,2.2485,3.4179,1.5841,4.0718,4.7978,3.0346,1.4795,8.8637,8.4168,11.5813,0.4945,0.361,0.6749,1.2666,2.069,5.0536,1.9387,9.2897,3.272,4.6548,3.8402,4.5458,0.0638,5.0058,3.7486,4.9914,1.0302,3.1887,1.1675,0.7212,0.8285,2.8924,5.917,4.1524,6.7524,2.2205,2.9399,3.0006,5.5874,14.7405,2.059,2.2985,4.0556,2.9979,4.8666,0.2023,2.5104,0.243,1.1903,0.4444,0.5126,4.9277,7.1801,5.1764,0.0019,1.2549,12.1341,4.545,4.8835,6.3894,2.7405,0.6104,4.6852,1.7677,0.7844,0.7312,0.1215,0.3158,4.101,0.1152,6.649,0.3483,4.9481,2.572,1.5273,3.3007,3.4114,4.4212,2.4758,4.6868,0.0272,0.596,0.0825,0.1851,0.8372,1.652,0.3572,5.8212,4.7362,6.7462,0.0984,0.7733,0.4188,5.327,0.3384,7.435,5.5187,1.6213,5.854,1.7812,7.7517,0.6042,6.205,3.968,5.1784,1.6563,1.818,2.6169,6.649,5.7405,4.526,0.1397,5.4699,2.5229,2.5752,3.3617,6.1034,0.001,0.0017,0.1986,2.8772,6.2836,0.9372,2.7799,1.8807,6.7386,6.0177,8.5276,0.5722,4.4959,1.4844,6.0866,4.1825,1.7859,0.2674,0.5946,1.7621,8.2056,3.763,3.0044,1.543,4.4512,5.1156,1.8991,3.479,4.1301,0.014,0.0088,4.8349,7.0486,4.1224,3.7291,2.6525,3.06,1.1321,3.9976,0.7176,1.488,2.4764,1.3257,0.7152,0.2324,5.8424,4.0666,0.2998,2.0805,0.5294,0.3759,1.1603,2.9699,1.7819,5.1536,1.8834,0.0537,1.0017,5.6542,5.2669,4.736,1.3775,5.4114,1.4945,1.0168,2.5788,1.7272,4.5479,7.935,0.4865,1.1278,4.8689,2.6232,1.855,2.2655,2.8066,0.7459,0.5657,0.2748,0.3729,1.8928,8.1229,7.4532,2.083,5.3231,0.7182,4.2339,0.5614,4.9679,2.0983,4.2892,3.8568,0.1035,1.1499,5.0509,2.2179,0.0013,0.0012,0.3015,0.4874,3.1534,1.0667,0.0391,0.7777,5.2642,0.0295,0.0272,5.9014,0.5513,4.8373,5.0509,0.1109,0.1253,0.1457,1.3046,0.1248,3.2746,0.2386,1.1751,3.3515,1.1872,3.3472,1.9936,0.6958,1.8768,0.0638,1.1196,5.5397,0.1908,0.4512,4.4915,0.4928,0.7971,0.0308,0.0079,0.5524,3.5312,0.0459,0.0031,1.8562,3.2457,3.7488,0.1699,0.3417,1.4244,1.3328,6.0941,1.0723,3.6318,3.635,0.0205,0.741,1.8841,0.0013,0.0183,0.1417,1.3575,2.6729,7.3046,6.5862,7.2049,1.3345,1.9351,3.8296,0.3808,7.5367,1.6057,1.8603,3.155,3.8078,3.0416,5.271,2.6242,4.4603,5.2859,4.093,2.5325,3.6476,0.7132,5.5184,1.2026,5.8911,0.3594,5.2083,0.0499,0.8742,0.0435,0.0093,1.6483,5.9031,5.2932,0.0266,0.3172,0.155,0.646,0.091,2.5538,0.2756,3.3827,2.8614,1.281,1.7129,0.3105,0.6018,0.048,4.776,0.247,0.8819,0.0009,0.0163,0.044,1.4342,2.8548,4.2991,5.5502,3.8076,4.8755,1.5431,4.0919,1.1674,1.2532,0.2066,2.8763,3.9152,0.0016,0.1377,0.0412,0.3438,0.3515,1.6409,0.1543,1.9804,3.7845,2.3889,3.6839,6.0117,0.0006,0.003,6.027,1.3357,0.136,1.456,2.9185,1.6539,4.506,0.7831,1.1275,7.4365,4.8568,2.0706,5.8329,8.6157,0.081,2.9387,0.1425,0.0485,0.0407,7.7769,8.8614,5.8394,0.0023,0.0757,0.1386,1.0822,0.176,1.7894,0.5593,3.9348,1.586,0.1318,0.1748,1.1576,3.1411,0.9601,4.6249,3.0354,1.2007,5.2057,0.1537,1.4073,2.4024,0.3906,6.699,0.0016,1.9355,0.9483,1.0299,0.7752]}

The Austro - Hungarian Royal Guard ( HZV ) which was already under heavy Austro - German control before the war, saw a great benefit in the creation of a state of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs because the HZV would thus be able to continue to exist as a force protecting Hungary against the new state's enemies of communism.\nWhile there had been previous threats of intervention by the Austro - German government into what the Austro - Hungarian monarch had originally created for himself and for his own purpose, these were ignored because the Austro - German monarch had already agreed on the disbandment of the HZV.\nThe HZV finally disbanded in late November 1918 ( according to The Official Year Book of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic [ Czech Socialist republic, ed.1 ], Praha, 1974, Vol. 4, p.\n1022 ).\nAt the same time, the HZV was officially separated from the regular Austro - Hungarian army, and became an infantry regiment, which was given a few tanks to protect Prague and Vienna.\nDuring the course of the Austro - Hungarian - British intervention on the Yugoslav, the HZV ( which had not been disbanded after the armistice ) fought alongside the British in the campaign, but was finally withdrawn because of inadequate transport conditions.\nAt the end of the year, the Czechoslovak government decided to have the HZV disbanded - not because it was ready to accept independence, but because it had nothing to do there.\nThus, the HZV became the last surviving military unit of the Austro - Hungarian Empire.\nThe HZV continued its existence as an infantry regiment in the newly formed State of Czechoslovakia after the Second World War only until 1952.\nBefore that the HZV, with its personnel, took part in the Polish - Soviet struggle against the Germans.\nDuring the war, the Royal Guard was stationed at Bratislava, Lviv and other places.\nThe regiment was dissolved in 1989.","token_len":469,"entropy":[2.3183,11.8208,1.7306,13.7329,8.5645,6.4056,9.3428,6.2182,6.5153,1.5422,1.9846,0.5771,1.4531,2.9879,4.1647,6.3131,0.4695,5.2341,1.6795,8.7691,3.5494,0.0793,1.1232,5.623,2.253,6.4963,0.6535,9.2435,3.6367,1.7021,10.3826,0.1926,0.9245,3.9344,0.0325,3.6222,11.6559,3.5681,0.9889,1.5137,5.0898,0.0487,4.0409,4.138,2.9272,1.6486,6.104,0.0798,1.0419,7.3141,2.4377,0.7653,1.6451,1.6631,0.3179,6.0526,4.7738,8.8109,4.1243,2.5743,6.1287,5.6532,4.9232,0.8494,5.8789,1.4189,4.8334,3.2811,4.3081,9.4739,0.0631,2.2796,4.3146,2.4736,6.0898,0.7137,2.2194,1.3965,6.1207,2.9079,3.6034,5.5464,1.1944,1.7993,3.7788,0.0199,1.1735,3.7985,1.4086,2.6609,3.5746,0.9089,1.6151,0.6046,0.0031,0.0942,0.078,0.0141,6.6388,1.9803,4.6014,0.0285,0.1042,2.8977,7.1275,1.5263,0.5475,0.0058,5.1909,1.2697,5.6017,2.2422,0.5781,3.9306,5.7019,4.6721,1.9529,1.0669,4.9163,3.4762,4.8171,4.953,5.0834,3.8031,0.6212,1.3053,6.594,4.0918,4.3265,0.255,6.2519,7.1236,1.6358,6.1088,0.9739,0.6089,2.0574,0.071,0.5906,2.6163,2.7115,5.1203,6.2605,3.8467,2.2478,0.0572,0.1631,1.4756,6.0532,3.0649,5.5876,5.1228,3.394,2.0103,2.3952,3.6102,1.2618,2.7917,6.9456,0.5126,4.3892,1.6299,4.1478,3.2093,1.1948,1.5241,0.0078,0.1294,0.2663,4.0447,1.5366,2.1638,5.1982,3.5683,1.2922,8.9131,0.7384,0.0652,0.3153,1.0094,0.021,0.0234,1.969,1.4752,1.6373,2.8674,0.018,0.028,6.9215,2.5689,0.8281,4.9829,4.4842,0.5835,4.0295,7.6434,0.0039,5.0021,5.1078,7.3889,3.6214,1.2304,1.0654,4.4096,2.6933,0.1776,4.9663,0.3954,4.6948,5.2846,4.6563,6.1469,3.7003,7.6796,0.1325,10.9522,3.2965,10.7897,1.5138,2.5373,6.0652,1.4964,4.265,0.2477,3.2994,0.4928,0.7704,0.164,7.4656,7.2058,5.6427,3.7069,0.8699,4.6751,0.7606,2.0468,0.028,0.8302,0.8805,2.1071,0.016,0.0154,1.6698,5.611,6.4617,0.1339,0.3491,6.6058,3.5334,0.007,0.2913,3.2389,2.3294,2.1615,2.1155,4.6525,2.6195,5.7386,1.2437,2.1949,2.3774,1.259,4.541,2.3924,5.8277,7.0009,2.6034,3.6217,9.0278,1.7298,4.558,0.955,1.2808,3.6069,0.4581,4.9494,0.0012,0.3713,4.3179,0.0044,0.285,1.2774,7.7799,4.9713,3.7121,4.3595,0.9599,4.2509,4.7492,2.4691,0.6801,0.0192,0.0132,4.6644,4.4428,1.644,4.1132,1.0313,3.881,3.6403,0.5196,6.9922,0.0042,0.0002,2.8719,5.3455,2.8626,0.3667,3.3764,2.0927,0.852,5.2321,4.9892,2.8064,2.057,4.9584,3.0582,4.9648,0.5643,7.2905,6.2082,7.9332,1.0691,0.8269,3.7448,0.5549,1.1559,0.0011,1.138,3.8439,1.4631,1.0333,4.3723,0.4201,0.0375,3.1111,2.5559,0.3398,4.9061,0.6745,0.6738,0.0036,0.0053,2.711,5.9157,4.3298,0.8386,1.6909,0.7336,5.4635,0.5084,3.7867,4.9733,1.0242,0.153,0.2387,0.9568,2.2074,5.7555,0.5303,1.2352,9.3651,0.8815,0.9011,6.31,0.5079,1.0707,0.96,0.0048,0.0092,3.2135,1.4826,5.5581,3.5228,3.4353,0.968,0.8797,0.169,1.0694,0.0012,0.2479,0.8448,1.4748,1.1825,0.5556,1.4916,1.7876,0.0353,0.0172,3.853,2.7304,2.8537,1.4166,1.5745,0.6823,0.3558,2.6735,1.122,7.1398,1.0637,2.5625,0.0246,3.0508,0.0204,0.0067,3.402,0.4963,4.6556,0.0901,0.0015,7.6978,4.5893,6.3892,1.236,0.7815,5.8258,2.4174,3.1478,0.4833,0.0035,0.0095,3.8499,3.6684,1.0633,8.3216,1.8007,6.1221,1.2646,0.0189,0.9397,5.3779,5.6135,3.6395,7.3095,0.8288,0.7657,2.8693,1.3458,0.8847,3.0396,0.5029,2.0626,0.6198,0.5915,8.2961,1.8039,1.6946,3.8273,1.2753,5.7146,0.6881,0.041,0.0015,1.22,8.1117,0.4161,1.1173,2.9229,3.2492,1.9416,0.9015,1.6359,6.2103,0.9597,6.7448,0.9363,5.3096,1.7998]}

PA 261 was first designated in 1913 by an agreement among the state departments of Public Works, Railroads and Roads, and Forestry. PA 261 was designated through its entire length, including the interstate, in 1975. PA 261 between the Delaware border and Chelsea, also known as \"The New Turnpike,\" was originally the New Turnpike and was created by a state law that required the state to divert traffic away from major roads. PA 261 was originally the New Turnpike, named for the turnpike created in the mid-1800s along its New York portion. An official state highway was first designated as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from Reading to York in 1909. Following the 1911 construction of Reading Airport, PA 261 was extended east through a turnpike through Reading.\nPA 261 was re-named after former Pennsylvanian governor and Democrat John B. Harlan, who served from 1948 to 1969 during periods when roads in Pennsylvania did not receive the attention they received during the Democratic administration of President Franklin Roosevelt. The PA State Office of Transportation has not maintained a continuous record of the PA 261 highway's length. PA 261's current length was originally published on a Pennsylvania Department of Roads map as being 1,046 miles. To put it in perspective, the total length of US 1 is approximately 4,100 miles. PA 261 is more than 3,100 miles in length.\nPA 261-PA 262, or PA 261 -PA 262 in some parts of Pennsylvania, is a pair of highways in the western section of the Commonwealth connecting I-76 to U.S. Route 15 along the Allegheny Front. The two highways also coincide with PA 1, PA 28, PA 309, and PA 31 before they merge onto PA 75. The term \"Turnpike Highway\" is also used to refer to PA 261 ; this is especially true in the eastern part of the state. It is frequently referred to as Pennsylvanian Turnpike due to its long history as a toll highway.\nPA 21 is a heavily traveled highway in Pennsylvania, a part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between I-76 in New York State and Pennsylvania Route 76 in Philadelphia.","token_len":470,"entropy":[10.8759,6.796,7.4126,0.0066,3.5152,11.2832,1.0457,4.6018,0.1225,6.9078,3.9182,2.2475,10.5584,9.455,2.0335,9.8076,0.2729,3.068,3.8296,0.0029,11.2185,5.4727,7.5383,5.829,2.5907,5.5014,5.6849,0.2244,10.426,1.0515,2.6374,0.446,1.129,5.2838,4.6867,1.8918,2.9956,2.2309,6.0335,3.836,4.6031,0.8326,1.3124,3.7496,0.1674,5.9911,0.79,0.5817,7.4304,0.281,1.021,4.1691,1.2519,1.1997,9.4696,0.9405,1.7107,0.2316,0.6317,2.416,6.2233,4.5938,7.4635,4.1454,2.4702,3.6463,1.173,7.4814,2.8606,2.8533,5.9849,0.5944,1.5642,0.292,8.7449,1.6536,0.2948,0.4748,0.1252,0.2568,3.0145,5.0119,1.1301,0.0191,3.225,2.7801,4.9258,7.3179,1.1948,0.0006,0.6559,0.8555,3.1984,4.3854,4.5376,0.1823,0.0494,0.0015,3.1581,1.5326,5.0662,1.623,2.8209,3.8982,2.6524,2.068,2.9158,1.8284,1.6206,0.479,7.0061,2.8118,5.2496,0.0056,4.7312,2.6422,1.7242,2.3369,0.2243,0.8695,3.3186,3.2048,1.3905,0.0702,0.0041,0.0015,1.5683,4.0474,0.9517,0.9556,4.8809,0.3863,0.0015,6.1478,1.9156,2.0923,4.0391,0.2847,1.1784,0.1778,3.8325,5.3153,5.6401,3.9715,7.7967,0.8978,6.2376,4.5272,4.1162,1.5974,2.4782,5.116,1.5643,2.4963,4.0318,0.0008,1.12,2.7362,2.2169,0.0048,0.0021,4.7874,11.0928,0.6182,5.5298,1.1842,4.5109,0.4709,5.548,1.0386,4.6796,4.0622,0.0936,8.5026,6.3948,0.4607,1.0269,0.2292,0.5271,5.5478,4.5212,3.8604,3.8041,6.2045,0.2746,0.0049,3.7595,6.7651,2.3896,3.0221,11.6896,0.5671,0.9341,5.769,0.9593,1.2122,2.9407,4.7106,3.9814,0.9538,0.4346,3.9468,2.1632,5.5357,2.7154,4.5694,0.4163,8.2955,2.3161,1.0872,0.3814,2.7555,2.9518,5.6612,0.3815,3.3172,5.9905,8.0003,0.8854,6.8609,2.4695,0.4988,5.3604,0.04,4.9347,2.2365,4.5173,1.0894,5.8635,2.348,0.7793,5.7582,2.6839,1.5907,1.5108,2.1914,2.5944,0.1817,2.4318,4.1505,6.0635,6.493,0.4565,2.1818,4.6265,4.8579,5.7589,1.3727,6.5151,1.4699,0.1152,1.4461,2.2831,3.0482,3.8133,4.0706,3.4367,1.3742,3.3749,0.4204,2.5681,3.2724,0.5461,3.6284,2.3662,5.5873,2.5778,3.9804,4.4525,2.302,0.0138,6.5216,2.3774,3.7794,5.7696,3.9176,0.8138,6.4522,0.806,1.509,5.5694,4.8022,2.5595,1.1553,0.3319,0.0757,1.2343,3.8829,0.3251,0.0815,7.6237,5.6727,4.485,3.6578,3.2828,1.2653,4.3768,0.0789,0.5154,2.3764,0.2978,2.0197,5.3017,0.2232,3.4598,0.598,3.0463,0.1001,3.8472,0.2166,0.8688,1.042,1.8337,0.4531,7.0527,5.7223,2.0744,3.7721,4.551,1.0526,1.3294,4.8852,4.2529,0.785,5.1341,5.3292,3.7816,0.058,1.2078,1.0625,1.3175,1.7666,7.8768,0.1291,2.8205,3.4476,1.2368,4.3388,3.3615,0.0885,0.8288,4.0519,7.172,7.0366,0.1493,4.2941,1.8354,5.9161,0.2998,0.0107,0.1083,2.6862,6.2334,5.7617,0.8611,3.1261,0.0076,6.2283,0.6255,1.6009,2.6421,1.2093,4.7173,7.4951,1.583,5.4173,5.3048,1.6784,3.1583,9.5539,1.0692,1.3152,7.0283,0.5971,1.0417,0.1097,4.4665,8.1788,2.5956,4.5672,4.2347,2.7939,9.1684,0.8212,1.7937,7.7247,0.794,7.9352,0.0162,0.002,7.2891,0.0596,1.3439,3.1209,0.6665,1.2002,0.6643,0.0119,1.9872,0.6757,9.043,3.2878,1.7567,5.3057,1.0522,2.0378,1.3955,2.7424,1.396,0.0473,0.7619,1.0782,0.7406,3.816,0.6895,4.6158,1.035,0.0023,0.1709,5.1768,3.2913,0.1436,1.4135,0.0061,0.0287,5.2214,0.0494,1.0785,3.3441,4.0661,2.3338,0.7581,5.5792,1.6947,0.8938,1.1058,1.6445,9.3638,2.8179,1.3008,7.0676,1.1065,2.5199,1.9333,0.5722,1.8962,4.9313,3.6569,0.0515,1.0365,2.9945,2.3692,0.0054,0.0041,4.8273,2.1866,0.0127,0.3981,4.0836,4.7447,0.403,3.6765,0.4047,2.5495,1.4056,6.0541,0.3206,2.3646,0.4978]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. version of Millionaire was launched by ABC as a half @ - @ hour primetime program on August 16 , 1999 . When it premiered , it became the first U.S. network game","text":"The U.S. version of Millionaire was launched by ABC as a half @ - @ hour primetime program on August 16, 1999. When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to receive such a rating. The game was developed by Robert Roemer and first played in 1981.\nAs with the U.K. version, there was also a Japanese version under the title of Million$ ( \u30e1\u30ac\u30c8\u30f3 Million$ ). It was presented since September 1989. On a September 1994 report, it appears that the Japanese version was on hiatus and had been replaced by two new games : MillionRyoko and MillionMonetary. However, this was not confirmed, as it remains to be seen whether the shows of Million$ or MillionRyoko returned to the same format on which they were initially aired.\nThe Millionaire series is based on the original game show in the United Kingdom, but with several differences. The original show began with 50 million pounds ( the equivalent of \u00a3 20,000.00 ) in the pot, and there was a single cash prize up for grabs. The American version initially had a single cash prize : a car. However, the show was not renewed after the tenth season. The show was not renewed for another two seasons.\nThe English version had two contests a week instead of the American version\u2019s four contests a week. This difference is due to the different format of the U. S. version. The first two contests were played at \u00a3 1,000,000 each ; the final two contests were played at \u00a3 500,000 each.\nThere is no question that the original television game show came from an idea of Bob Orman. The game was developed by Robert Roemer and first played on 21 May 1981. This game was designed so as to be competitive for players as well as fun for the general public.\nIt was produced by David Mertz and was played on BBC, the United Kingdom\u2019s main television network. The first game consisted of a pair of trivia questions such as \u2018 where did the Mona Lisa come from? \u2019. This is played using a five-choice choice, the answers being : Rome, Florence, France, Florence and the Louvre, and the winner is the player who picks the correct answer.","token_len":471,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,8.4875,0.3904,12.4562,3.3858,4.3083,4.1997,2.915,6.906,5.1549,0.8961,7.7242,18.1444,10.0871,4.9566,7.9431,9.1287,0.0093,2.8224,2.4452,4.233,3.6846,0.7237,4.0778,0.4861,6.0547,1.8329,3.3506,1.2601,1.3784,4.0969,0.5336,2.0772,3.4827,0.0016,0.002,0.24,3.1355,9.0371,0.4178,0.3725,4.6485,5.6408,0.5136,3.3087,0.8175,2.1279,4.0354,1.5787,4.735,0.3685,6.8518,7.2444,3.8817,1.6938,6.9073,5.5696,1.8185,5.104,1.1824,2.1255,10.9247,3.9621,1.5095,3.4843,0.0086,2.4117,0.6895,0.5252,0.5604,3.8389,1.3405,2.7601,0.6034,6.5706,0.5302,5.9132,1.455,2.5497,4.296,1.1378,11.1963,4.1285,8.3763,3.5275,2.8875,4.257,3.3802,8.3173,2.1086,2.01,2.8443,0.7337,5.6759,8.6914,4.4965,4.4185,1.3645,4.7805,5.0878,5.9643,6.9394,7.1769,1.0436,3.7468,7.5533,0.4543,1.1848,3.0893,0.4399,1.5519,5.1868,3.4595,2.9533,3.5178,1.309,2.5479,0.3871,6.4202,1.615,2.4774,7.1262,2.1834,10.0368,5.7237,0.944,0.4963,5.7913,7.184,1.3869,4.6037,0.0731,3.01,1.556,1.3835,1.1587,3.1412,1.4502,2.2111,5.657,2.6391,0.0603,0.077,1.4204,1.2214,8.2585,5.6277,1.9651,1.7697,2.0972,0.2737,0.9307,0.0158,7.0305,0.8107,1.2525,5.6188,0.855,3.789,5.7935,0.7069,0.9186,4.8076,2.458,0.316,0.6589,2.1809,3.1964,4.6016,2.66,3.0116,2.3537,0.2172,0.6842,3.1393,3.2194,4.4398,4.1314,2.2091,2.1769,1.7188,1.3844,2.8933,2.7832,4.6897,4.526,0.7459,1.0144,3.0279,2.7774,4.7596,1.3724,6.7895,2.7968,6.8457,2.4378,6.8683,3.2884,0.1303,5.0034,7.1642,0.8135,0.2996,4.905,0.5456,0.8631,2.2643,2.6195,8.4969,1.3901,1.4529,5.9221,0.9283,1.2842,5.2649,6.0155,1.15,6.7748,1.2591,0.0537,0.9453,0.9919,5.883,0.305,7.0378,1.9379,1.6013,3.4369,1.4658,0.0931,9.5729,2.4027,5.9535,2.3049,3.2189,0.048,1.444,2.9424,1.5549,4.4161,2.4257,3.0786,1.6589,7.879,0.8083,1.279,1.5217,2.7396,1.2137,4.095,1.3363,1.134,1.4387,2.7077,0.267,1.3208,1.2663,1.4468,5.856,0.3791,3.8008,3.4474,8.1282,6.6523,0.997,6.4242,0.0207,2.0032,1.3822,1.0976,13.9053,7.3189,6.2583,5.0363,1.7374,1.8158,0.1454,0.5652,3.5714,5.5505,2.5117,2.4377,0.0935,0.545,4.1555,2.1888,0.544,0.3297,4.4301,0.002,6.9838,0.182,1.2811,1.2442,1.1066,2.9057,2.3448,0.6227,0.9434,3.4678,2.6937,9.5761,3.2641,1.0619,0.618,3.0854,1.2392,2.1958,6.7671,0.349,3.5189,1.9644,1.0321,0.3949,0.6809,0.2488,0.1034,3.072,0.029,0.0032,0.461,0.5398,1.5636,3.7331,2.1207,1.3489,5.8002,0.165,0.7729,3.3738,6.0478,2.7983,0.7,5.9306,2.0068,3.1505,4.2022,2.3121,7.282,6.0636,8.6784,1.8537,1.7406,2.7591,1.3284,2.7452,0.497,3.1355,0.6516,0.0038,0.8987,2.5759,1.3374,2.3508,7.9162,3.3298,3.7724,0.9353,4.1767,1.6009,0.7696,4.3129,5.9161,3.6509,0.2562,1.6372,6.2753,4.3746,4.1744,4.092,0.8862,0.0279,7.0504,0.7775,1.3967,4.9327,0.2537,0.2941,2.1003,3.4727,0.8452,3.8052,0.4857,4.9002,4.9267,5.2145,1.1337,1.5261,2.9891,3.5596,2.0886,3.7623,5.2285,3.9554,5.2003,0.601,12.3802,1.5554,0.4214,4.9203,2.7292,2.3156,0.6287,1.517,3.1217,2.0034,6.0791,0.0611,1.7112,4.9153,0.0294,11.2135,2.2323,7.0182,0.0086,7.2204,6.6508,4.5906,1.6219,1.3077,7.8548,3.7005,0.0093,1.1225,0.0027,0.9456,2.7676,6.155,6.1331,3.6046,4.0798,5.4741,3.9191,1.2323,6.5235,0.7738,7.4194,5.4397,3.5276,4.8882,4.6698,1.9154,5.5876,9.8804,0.9552,4.7458,0.3263,5.6641,0.439,4.722,3.1658,3.5784,7.5723,0.0001,2.3018,2.9598,1.5379,4.4212,2.0329,2.6204,3.0134,0.8099,5.0934,0.5569,3.2984,0.1665,0.4587]}

From","text":"In October 1857, an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. From its beginning in 1857, the Beale Expedition carried the flag of the American government, carried letters and dispatches from government departments, and even delivered mail. They also brought the flag of an international peace organization called the \"South Pacific League\", which would later be known as the League of Nations. The Beales had an escort of American soldiers, Indians, Chinese, and Mexicans. The expedition consisted of 50 men on 4 canoes, and made it to California in 1858 in 17 months. The Beales' expedition established a trade route by sending provisions and goods down to Los Angeles. They were able to establish a fort, and construct a trading post, which was known as Fort Pierce. In 1858, the Beales opened the first railroad in the Pacific Northwest, a railroad from Soda Springs to the gold-fields in California. Later they would erect a railroad from the California Central Railroad to the city of Los Angeles. At the time, the Beale Expedition was the last major expedition before Charles Lindbergh and Erman L. Tompkins started the Air Mail Service, which in 1910 would open the doors for the post in the 20th century. The next year, Beale and his other companions would establish trade posts and the beading schools in the South Pacific.\nLudger V. Ebeling was a German explorer who spent more than twenty years in the Pacific and Asia in the name of the British. Afterwards, he retired. Later he published a book about his life, \"Der Vorschlag: Eine deutschen Reise im Spitzberg und Inneren Asia\" (The Forecast: A German Expedition to the Arctic and the Inside Asia), which was translated to English as The Forecast: A German Trip Around the World (1888).

On 16 November 1917, she was commissioned in the Mediterranean Squadron.\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Danton escorted HMCS\u00a0Halifax\u00a0(AM-34) between Norfolk, Virginia and her operational base at Gibraltar. Following a refit at Stettin and other modifications to improve the warfare of the ship, such as refitting the gun batteries, she joined the Canadian Grand Fleet on 7 April 1918, arriving at Halifax just before the Armistice.\nFollowing repairs and other modifications, Danton arrived at Dartmouth on 21 October 1919.\n\nDecommissioning and fate\n\nAt the conclusion of World War I, Danton returned to Dartmouth for repairs following which she arrived at Halifax in September 1920. On the morning of 22 March 1922, while on convoy escort duty, Danton lost control of a freighter while maneuvering in the waters of Baffin Bay and sank her. The ship was scuttled under a depth charge that was fired by HMCS\u00a0King Henry\u00a0(G-2).\n\nPresent\n\nFollowing the demise of the Canadian Grand Fleet in 1946, Danton came into British service with the Royal Canadian Navy and was purchased by Harland and Wolff of Belfast, Ireland in October 1949 ready for conversion to a supply ship. Harland and Wolff completed her conversion in 1950 and then refitted the vessel for service on the East Coast of the United States including Hawaii. She was placed out of commission in 1964 and laid up at St. John in Newfoundland.","token_len":471,"entropy":[6.6973,10.3498,2.7876,0.5224,6.3664,8.6099,10.0297,7.7662,6.659,8.9319,9.8749,7.7332,0.0378,3.7686,9.9183,3.0246,9.2941,7.8005,0.2979,11.8455,5.0455,3.3983,1.8251,3.2333,6.5462,9.668,0.7436,1.3506,5.4279,1.7274,1.8829,1.6024,3.9802,9.5189,0.617,0.0141,2.1513,0.3762,4.9954,2.9349,10.3718,0.0916,7.8773,6.8694,0.001,1.7118,3.0792,2.4342,5.5622,7.9358,0.1206,4.9548,0.0102,0.005,7.3605,1.3015,3.1977,1.3301,4.3546,2.3543,0.7193,3.2853,1.5536,5.0256,2.109,5.7938,0.16,0.4964,5.4119,4.0337,2.4816,3.0658,3.2595,1.2008,3.8162,0.1086,1.1878,0.0019,0.0052,3.2082,0.8687,1.9708,4.609,1.5622,1.2928,0.6632,6.4318,0.7245,5.761,0.4835,0.5518,1.8656,0.4102,0.6081,2.5648,0.7133,6.3725,0.2484,1.4937,0.0048,0.0025,2.5498,0.9445,0.7474,4.8829,0.3535,3.6491,0.0004,1.4546,3.4728,3.4042,0.069,4.1739,9.4882,8.4919,4.6385,7.7987,8.6731,5.8841,0.3269,0.6495,9.108,0.0077,1.302,0.5274,4.9233,2.6522,8.8113,0.0058,0.0269,1.3059,5.311,1.4825,0.2849,3.9801,0.3304,0.2663,5.0411,0.5493,2.0681,0.0262,6.2515,1.7174,0.0001,8.8832,3.3203,4.7661,1.6182,2.4075,1.7207,8.833,4.6293,0.2002,1.8199,3.7942,2.5084,3.6542,1.9555,6.1866,2.3863,4.0876,4.9717,0.5583,3.9877,3.6952,3.2508,2.2112,0.9933,2.2405,0.4655,3.0823,3.2172,0.987,6.3587,6.6357,2.0646,1.4949,18.1812,0.9426,5.8195,0.0025,1.5884,0.0017,0.1072,0.52,3.9234,0.0016,7.7562,6.7306,2.777,10.2434,7.1638,0.5286,3.1598,3.7491,7.9988,2.3509,4.9718,0.5748,6.9673,4.7428,2.8769,3.4754,0.4624,6.7762,8.0077,2.0434,0.7486,4.2783,0.8967,4.5666,2.4296,6.4483,0.1408,2.0976,4.5215,6.4833,0.1907,3.8275,5.1425,8.1703,2.5643,6.042,1.092,8.9916,4.0911,0.4531,4.7355,0.5618,8.1103,0.0235,4.6942,1.3314,0.7576,3.5129,6.5307,1.1174,1.5198,5.379,0.7023,6.1643,9.8237,0.6442,1.9691,3.6389,2.0904,0.8659,2.3921,4.8334,1.104,2.4402,5.1452,0.993,0.8504,5.7436,0.0613,0.0,1.1957,0.9523,4.2812,5.6802,2.1339,4.4307,2.3525,0.7959,1.6337,0.0006,4.2962,0.9181,5.9978,1.0098,4.0162,2.7795,1.7073,0.8228,1.9739,0.4576,6.314,1.0477,0.004,0.4737,2.6276,11.7706,0.5234,0.0021,3.5128,0.5953,3.7717,0.0026,2.0478,0.0005,0.1016,0.2562,1.2656,0.0006,4.2123,0.0923,4.5939,2.5272,2.4807,4.9834,3.8937,0.5772,6.2797,0.8797,2.1611,2.315,3.2267,1.6708,0.3388,3.4117,3.2651,3.9928,0.0584,3.6946,2.9248,2.4821,0.2659,5.2448,2.428,5.2619,4.6651,0.928,1.2549,1.6099,0.0005,4.6666,1.9596,0.0809,2.1479,6.8997,0.0013,4.176,6.8379,0.001,2.5368,0.7407,4.1582,1.6591,4.9869,2.2243,0.0241,1.0252,3.0247,2.4379,3.0653,2.1243,2.1019,1.805,0.8165,8.0164,0.0584,0.0059,5.2278,2.5726,5.9821,0.5128,5.005,2.1485,6.8691,1.5857,4.2194,0.0942,2.7028,6.5807,5.419,5.3624,0.8807,5.0945,1.6985,3.5761,1.9912,1.2866,0.0031,9.4199,2.1168,0.0019,3.6714,0.8428,5.3386,0.0128,0.8721,4.6113,1.9365,0.0048,1.1788,6.5586,0.153,0.9435,0.0006,6.157,2.94,7.3682,1.1912,2.1249,0.8025,1.1225,2.3097,0.1031,2.9305,1.5115,8.5998,0.3262,6.9059,5.4326,3.1662,7.1732,0.8178,3.7895,6.6358,2.0809,1.7743,1.6302,4.4996,3.1761,12.6263,1.0025,4.8254,0.49,1.7524,7.0008,0.6061,0.6374,6.7627,0.0103,1.1038,0.0197,0.0004,5.0002,2.3772,1.0367,1.3608,3.7959,1.2335,3.8765,6.4008,0.3516,0.9486,4.0569,2.7175,2.6245,2.7805,1.8799,6.0764,1.1207,0.8737,0.4498,0.6436,0.3948,6.7643,6.061,0.6989,3.107,0.7286,5.717,6.3947,0.1873,2.9877,0.943,4.7338,1.1989,6.2681,2.686,1.9357,3.914,1.3296,1.4868,4.746,6.4805,2.5039]}

The Hiei class replaced the first class Kan\u014d @ - @ corvettes, and were built to a design closely modeled on the U. S. Perry-class and Venator-class frigates, being slightly larger and also slightly longer. The design included the ability to launch a 30-mm gun directly from the bow of a Japanese corvette, and the possibility of being fitted with two cannons and four or six 20 mm naval guns, giving the corvette considerably more armament and fire power than its predecessor. The Hiei class vessels were not large, but were large enough to be able to maneuver quickly, and to have a relatively long crew space. They had a speed of 20 knots or more ( 31 mph ).\nThe first vessel of this series, the Hiei @ - @ ( \" ) class, was launched in 1875 and entered service around 1880. The Hiei @ - @ ( @ ) class ships were much larger, with a design similar to the second class Kan\u014d @ - @ corvettes and the second class S\u014dry\u016b class corvettes. The Hiei @ - @ ( @ ) class was launched in 1887 and entered service in 1890. The Hiei @ - @ ( @ ) class was the last major vessel of the corvette design in service for the Imperial Japanese Navy, as most corvettes were eventually replaced with the Sato-class, Sakae-class, and\/or the Ise-class wooden-hulled corvettes.\nThe Hiei @ - @ ( @ ) class was the last Corvette to be built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were the last to be designed under this type of ship in the Navy's design catalogue, and were built only after the Sakae-class was already completed. The Hiei @ - @ ( @ ) class differed only little in design from the other two classes.","token_len":472,"entropy":[11.1041,10.5948,3.6619,13.3001,10.1816,7.3447,0.8374,1.4269,5.8726,8.7226,11.3259,3.0444,8.2082,6.4021,0.7298,6.6529,3.3433,0.2363,0.05,3.8025,9.2551,8.5731,6.0418,4.883,4.3314,3.666,0.2589,0.0345,3.2009,8.3932,2.708,4.9149,4.7327,1.6431,9.8646,2.1118,0.6067,9.9257,5.8626,12.0254,6.2005,7.0191,5.4044,9.36,0.0826,9.5891,2.9908,0.028,5.2859,2.8834,0.7907,4.1444,2.0518,0.196,1.8884,1.1716,3.6685,0.279,0.9938,1.1911,0.0981,2.3098,3.4344,6.9488,4.4752,2.3183,2.8066,1.3459,4.9277,0.073,0.7571,6.8826,5.14,1.5626,0.7115,0.5353,0.4038,2.4326,1.7413,3.485,0.0737,0.006,2.1451,8.6494,0.3611,5.2214,1.0556,7.1859,0.0861,1.3579,0.4501,0.1805,6.1631,0.2778,0.013,1.8455,1.7688,4.9723,3.1024,2.089,3.7697,4.9143,8.189,4.8964,0.9631,0.3927,5.1847,0.5812,3.6572,0.0307,9.8565,3.7831,0.6391,5.432,9.4624,2.2405,1.4857,0.0191,5.7303,0.0003,2.159,5.2922,5.2314,1.7597,1.1655,5.4942,3.4321,2.912,0.8893,1.3363,4.6161,5.2315,2.4283,4.2588,0.114,4.7561,2.0749,6.4375,0.883,3.2922,2.2385,6.0482,1.1222,0.4648,3.1484,1.1004,1.5369,4.9274,1.587,0.0867,0.9385,1.7074,1.9871,4.136,0.5071,4.1103,4.0863,0.1289,3.6282,4.8826,2.7552,4.0199,4.9679,3.2122,6.2225,1.9798,7.5832,1.2626,1.8823,4.3836,0.8626,3.5328,0.7371,6.4846,0.536,5.778,0.1536,2.0372,7.4823,1.4129,1.274,2.0816,1.9088,0.539,1.2401,1.6737,0.0117,0.0019,0.9016,4.795,0.6789,4.2446,6.1434,2.4502,1.1525,1.6695,5.0109,0.0285,0.4005,2.0921,3.48,0.0062,4.8891,3.6444,2.4363,1.2449,2.6497,3.4427,1.3479,3.4341,2.913,4.0264,6.8964,0.9556,2.5339,2.2076,1.3749,5.8696,0.1685,4.1075,0.2773,4.2113,0.8028,3.6674,10.269,4.1408,2.4738,2.3718,2.9953,3.229,4.6356,1.156,2.4297,4.004,1.6509,0.5463,1.8384,0.1323,0.0081,2.1846,0.2982,0.1907,6.2685,6.5176,6.5609,1.0148,0.9676,0.2874,3.6544,1.4373,3.3362,3.8757,2.2066,5.6955,0.0209,3.8826,3.2864,0.5075,1.3671,1.6902,0.0125,0.0017,1.6478,0.2782,0.0348,2.9648,4.3417,1.6621,0.0919,5.3876,0.7009,5.2421,1.0499,1.4549,2.1585,0.9321,5.5313,1.4994,0.0988,0.784,6.6156,0.2697,3.7821,0.0205,0.1594,0.1858,0.1217,1.3999,0.0879,0.0166,3.5801,2.2996,3.3852,0.1777,5.3658,2.7397,4.5081,1.9558,2.9523,1.108,0.4614,0.0034,0.7741,1.135,1.0646,0.0061,0.0014,1.5994,0.1129,0.0125,2.0798,0.2908,0.0525,0.0568,1.3668,3.5419,0.8655,0.7212,3.2845,0.8843,0.4532,0.004,1.8337,3.2672,0.4667,0.603,0.4941,0.004,0.0014,0.4117,0.0901,0.0078,1.4631,0.2249,0.0268,0.0228,0.9827,4.9915,1.6372,4.3885,2.8491,0.6524,0.5138,8.6096,1.8641,4.8283,3.5136,2.1473,4.0477,1.0783,0.9444,0.1291,0.0204,1.5689,3.7021,5.0122,3.3387,0.0407,0.0054,0.9353,4.607,2.0733,2.2631,2.1531,2.5964,5.8927,1.8287,0.0732,3.0885,10.438,4.4488,0.7695,0.0337,0.6778,0.8649,6.5551,0.0006,1.999,5.4881,4.8652,1.0275,0.0162,9.6243,3.857,3.3937,0.148,0.7645,0.8098,0.403,0.0022,0.5169,1.5395,1.075,1.325,0.0187,0.0022,1.2493,0.1386,0.0205,1.6453,0.8189,0.0441,0.058,1.2571,1.3431,1.0514,11.0272,3.9254,1.031,0.7838,1.7683,0.1858,0.3452,0.1295,0.0129,1.1743,4.6568,0.4964,2.9585,2.0263,3.7301,0.9513,4.6808,4.8258,4.0235,4.1132,0.2123,3.2578,4.8209,1.4674,3.0861,2.6333,4.266,7.9192,1.0549,1.0385,1.2525,2.7099,3.6983,2.5489,0.5061,9.1155,0.0378,0.2236,0.0356,2.3613,6.8414,3.593,0.8024,1.2693,0.8121,0.0061,0.0021,0.4131,0.0658,0.0184,1.163,0.163,0.0248,0.03,8.409,4.0724,6.2479,2.6977,0.9923,1.1559,0.3156,2.3902,3.0681,1.944,1.7579]}
{"prompt":"Another alternative landing concept was the US Air Force 's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft . This proposal arose soon after the cancellation of the X @ - @ 20 Dyna @ -","text":"Another alternative landing concept was the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose soon after the cancellation of the X @ - @ 20 Dyna @ - A mission, and the two X A - @ 10 flight computers were scrapped in May 1971. The NASA management believed that the weight of a wing attached to the spacecraft would not only decrease the launch mass but also reduce spacecraft radiation and thermal loads on the wings. However the wing configuration was dropped because of the cost.\nAt the time of writing this paper NASA is considering an experimental configuration for the X @ 15, which may be a combination of a wing and an inverted cube [4].\nVI. Conclusions\nX @ 10 was a successful deep space interplanetary space shuttler, although the system did a low return to operational readiness and suffered from a number of operational and structural problems. This paper has reviewed the various X @ 10 systems and mission concepts that contributed to its development and the problems that plagued the system design. The major operational problems were:\n\u2022 The failure of the spacecraft to maintain an attitude around the x-axis,\nIn addition the launchers were not able to compensate for these failures as they were designed to work as single-point actuators.\n\u2022 A low thruster firing rate by design prevented the vehicles from manoeuvring to a point in space where the X @ 10 would be able to pass through the X 1 0 + and X 1 0 -apertures and make the final approach to Mars, even if the vehicles were initially designed to be autonomous.\nThe system design and development process encountered a number of problems that affected its viability. As a result, all of the systems and mission designs that were considered to be the successors of X @ 10 were unable to be developed and tested successfully.\nOne of the major operational problems encountered by the X @ 10 system was its inability to maintain attitude control. NASA acknowledged this and proposed a new interplanetary shuttle -the X @ 25 -at least 15 times before the project was cancelled in 1975.\nAs well, the design was so complex and involved so many different elements that a team of professionals was needed to understand all the subsystems if it was to proceed. This led to the development of a large number of subsystems and an additional development programme that delayed the project further.","token_len":473,"entropy":[8.9723,10.1539,8.4477,2.9445,2.3474,6.7025,2.7747,0.0541,0.8192,6.4078,0.6866,6.9549,8.671,0.519,1.4365,6.6044,1.8078,2.2669,3.6374,8.0809,7.4511,0.0588,0.6849,5.7394,0.0223,0.5464,4.9433,14.0244,6.9146,6.2452,6.4927,9.5049,2.6893,6.8998,2.2771,6.6782,6.4837,3.3204,2.5993,2.2608,5.5972,5.8121,6.3779,3.3777,0.687,4.1863,7.8513,7.8395,0.9809,4.4975,2.2096,4.537,4.6447,0.3842,1.6906,6.3918,8.0831,5.4717,0.6221,1.0428,7.1234,0.5071,3.3967,3.6094,6.8796,0.1899,0.585,0.9415,1.1921,2.9615,5.406,4.404,1.0936,4.1499,3.3715,1.1843,0.9269,2.424,6.3107,8.1347,2.6804,4.7685,4.296,2.8,0.4455,4.8893,0.4547,3.3413,3.6173,4.0849,3.5745,1.2392,7.8098,3.2073,0.9075,1.3253,3.3788,2.1576,2.034,8.1331,0.9261,0.8695,1.1907,6.1028,2.3193,4.3241,5.6298,2.1364,4.627,3.3084,4.715,4.5681,1.6494,1.0267,1.4409,0.8278,5.5178,3.7772,1.8561,3.7528,1.0493,2.9138,4.2938,0.0678,1.7417,2.1692,1.3533,2.4015,6.1189,9.264,6.8628,3.7933,0.589,2.0146,10.2353,0.5084,5.2438,0.1154,0.5639,5.807,0.1722,3.1498,3.5167,2.3482,3.3347,10.0352,0.9061,7.5728,0.216,0.0001,3.6196,7.099,0.0422,5.4859,2.0628,4.574,1.7588,5.7669,3.3011,6.6691,5.6947,5.9563,1.4103,7.4042,4.86,2.931,5.7779,1.6865,1.8801,2.2752,0.0011,3.1486,3.1456,3.9125,0.7415,0.6273,3.4025,2.4734,4.4789,4.8906,0.8929,4.2834,4.6424,0.1138,0.7772,1.8848,1.3276,8.6126,3.8618,2.767,4.9159,0.101,2.3345,4.7768,1.0538,3.1584,4.4856,1.4049,4.0807,1.5836,1.8476,4.949,0.6831,1.8612,4.3843,5.5975,1.2196,1.8436,2.6367,0.7381,3.336,1.8847,4.5046,0.5398,0.5146,4.4108,1.0403,3.304,3.4857,4.4967,6.9275,0.6028,6.8854,2.0517,1.1613,2.6627,5.1365,8.2755,2.8484,2.7539,11.6789,1.8087,1.6501,2.2009,0.006,6.2006,0.1854,5.2922,3.2544,4.6816,1.683,1.2593,4.0129,0.6284,4.925,3.7759,5.958,1.4434,5.1021,8.6562,0.0251,1.1566,0.99,0.3856,3.886,4.3244,6.2007,0.0891,5.9409,1.7021,5.9408,5.8653,4.56,0.7325,6.1071,0.1312,6.5349,0.032,2.9629,2.537,4.6429,2.4867,1.6128,1.6706,1.3042,3.7572,0.226,0.4195,2.3581,1.3147,1.23,0.003,5.3184,2.2284,1.3909,3.6902,5.8994,7.2385,5.9977,5.0733,1.5552,1.7905,1.1937,1.4083,11.4791,0.3707,2.1165,2.667,5.2105,2.7464,5.5501,1.663,0.8729,5.4809,3.3554,4.8984,1.4597,0.7654,4.3321,0.9785,6.569,4.3537,0.4152,2.8842,7.202,0.5227,0.2869,3.1052,3.6282,1.6597,2.6322,3.2317,2.0287,7.7731,2.5604,0.1976,0.0008,1.3712,2.8109,4.4476,1.7396,4.0898,0.9281,4.834,1.0811,0.1323,1.3845,5.2839,1.7612,0.1398,2.0771,3.3077,2.0653,2.8063,2.083,1.0392,2.8846,3.2524,0.5114,3.3627,6.8868,0.9496,0.7623,0.0281,0.1796,0.6031,8.3238,0.013,2.1015,2.031,2.2493,2.2046,3.4209,0.6743,1.3864,4.6624,0.8215,0.2136,1.4422,2.9429,0.5108,2.8991,1.4809,0.5279,0.4944,0.0248,0.0454,1.0715,0.6654,1.8468,2.5382,0.0042,1.9409,4.3262,3.1677,1.5167,7.2231,7.2291,1.9911,3.3703,3.4764,1.3862,2.2242,7.0971,0.0503,0.0001,4.4447,5.7944,6.029,1.2397,0.2622,3.9518,1.4034,7.1741,3.5713,5.3854,1.8409,3.6108,1.5466,3.8547,0.4225,1.5941,2.2764,3.6206,0.3943,1.6474,4.3288,4.5157,2.3919,0.835,3.5671,3.8205,4.5226,2.1969,2.0011,4.0708,1.2366,0.1412,2.6901,3.4476,0.4808,3.8373,4.2954,0.3314,6.6442,2.2484,2.8694,0.2286,5.4054,3.1682,1.4557,6.1163,0.0801,9.8614,1.4667,0.6756,0.1656,5.8755,0.8413,2.6723,4.3648,0.0863,1.4244,2.3366,0.056,1.6229,4.5282,0.9219,0.0033,4.0031,0.2989,2.0734,4.0928,3.9665,4.1832,4.4928,2.4182,7.7739,0.6496,2.8587,4.334,0.544]}

The freeway runs north of, and parallel to, the Kalamazoo River through eastern Calhoun County. On October 15, 1996, the freeway took advantage of two construction and maintenance projects to widen the route. Two of these projects were a five-\u00a0mile right-angle bend extension completed on the route near the center town of Hancock and a 20\u00a0mph speed limit enforcement ramp project completed on a southbound section of the route adjacent to, and a northbound 10\u00a0mph speed limit enforcement ramp project completed on a southbound section of the route adjacent to. The ramp projects began construction on April 9, 1998 and were completed on October 18, 1999 along and on to. Construction included the widening of the freeway to five traffic lanes, the addition of two shoulders on each side of the highway, the addition of a set of parallel parking lanes, the widening of shoulders and the addition of a center median, the placement of an 80 foot curbside turn lane on both north and southbound lanes; and the addition of a curb and gutter intersection with. From, a one-way lane extended to the east shoulder on the southbound lanes for a short distance between and. The freeway is currently being widened to six lanes. On November 23, 2000, a speed limit enforcement lane system began to be enforced on the highways. This project included the construction of two speed limit enforcement lanes on southbound lanes, and one speed limit enforcement lane on northbound lanes, on and. A left turn lane was placed on each side of all three lanes of in November 2009. The lanes were expanded on October 22, 2010. Construction began in August 2016 to widening the freeway to six lanes in each direction. The widening was completed on July 22, 2017. In 2020 the Kalamazoo Fire and Rescue Department plans to expand the right turn lanes to 4 lanes on the right. The construction began in May 2020 and should be complete in August 2022. The expansion is funded by the Michigan Department of Transportation. The widening project includes the construction of shoulders between and and widening the center median at to accommodate the addition of additional lane. After the completion of this project, the route will have its right turn lanes widened to four lanes on the right and two lanes on the left.","token_len":473,"entropy":[7.9508,9.5669,1.349,6.4311,13.1832,8.4333,4.8853,9.1793,12.4334,1.2248,9.5439,5.1673,4.1995,1.58,3.4883,1.0738,0.2831,8.7075,2.3291,3.0955,7.706,3.5133,3.0077,2.4757,6.8449,1.9404,4.5185,0.3867,0.261,1.3969,7.4832,0.8733,0.0004,1.1626,5.0031,5.6908,8.4131,0.4811,0.1788,0.6334,4.4739,6.5366,3.5211,0.8341,5.2177,0.6649,1.602,2.4301,5.8848,5.7402,0.0061,5.6146,6.7372,4.4587,2.4513,2.3413,1.9359,3.4306,0.8114,5.2479,1.8758,4.961,2.7077,0.8922,1.1342,0.9765,5.0257,6.2467,0.3819,12.3594,2.1085,8.1234,0.8643,5.0672,6.1728,7.0377,7.6479,2.4314,1.7875,5.9276,4.4234,1.886,6.3209,8.163,0.1925,7.3666,2.3692,1.0546,4.8407,6.3282,7.6304,3.7191,0.4134,6.871,4.0462,2.7998,3.4574,1.2045,3.5382,3.6294,0.2891,4.2048,0.288,0.3955,2.0061,5.956,0.0184,6.7519,0.5166,5.1766,3.5474,0.0235,5.687,2.8332,0.9827,0.5101,0.0502,0.2014,0.2395,0.7658,0.8952,0.4308,0.8226,1.1825,0.0014,0.3924,0.0364,0.072,0.104,0.6287,0.0009,3.6941,1.5878,4.556,2.8173,5.0113,3.9545,0.9857,3.4832,3.5211,0.1277,2.5934,1.4759,1.7093,0.2753,0.8882,2.3023,3.3328,0.1084,2.1462,6.2924,6.3503,3.7331,5.9768,4.8673,4.5858,5.1839,2.4424,2.5432,0.1887,0.7663,2.1665,2.2518,6.1291,6.6401,0.4234,1.7038,2.1502,2.2946,0.028,2.6431,8.7268,2.9578,2.1296,0.3604,0.315,0.1174,2.8779,0.5359,1.8498,1.1454,0.0253,1.1079,7.2158,0.1224,5.8817,3.2464,2.4718,1.2197,1.5858,2.7792,0.055,9.1081,2.3454,2.4961,1.3196,0.0128,1.0436,5.841,4.5239,3.1775,1.9532,6.9743,0.0478,3.8805,5.083,1.6736,6.7911,1.867,0.0286,4.9233,1.6116,2.0304,3.3282,4.6819,0.5871,0.0292,1.3705,1.1914,5.6132,1.0511,0.6158,1.1878,0.0459,0.8405,4.1591,3.0487,7.1021,0.4966,6.8846,3.6506,6.5971,6.0809,5.5139,4.2993,5.3251,0.7934,0.8965,4.1994,7.4846,2.7114,1.2861,2.3022,7.8373,3.024,0.6329,2.0532,2.2177,4.3234,4.4805,2.0838,4.3369,0.7179,3.3803,5.5481,4.2913,1.6228,2.5724,3.4443,3.0563,2.8501,1.583,1.2029,3.6913,0.7491,1.5257,3.3966,2.6907,3.7612,0.0808,2.3877,0.281,2.2193,7.4035,0.2045,1.0559,3.4808,8.2392,4.129,1.7182,0.4542,6.7701,0.9738,0.4912,7.4815,2.3286,2.7035,4.2003,2.7773,1.3693,2.4355,0.2056,2.3999,3.9164,1.5228,0.1841,1.8561,1.9087,4.6863,0.0272,2.7589,1.7312,2.2035,3.6105,0.454,0.0959,0.0359,0.2248,0.5816,0.8142,0.0019,0.2273,2.4268,3.446,3.4808,5.4023,3.5067,5.6098,2.2796,0.4205,0.7496,3.838,0.7067,2.772,0.8676,0.0863,6.2284,2.8527,0.9288,1.9098,7.7584,10.9797,6.8086,0.7054,1.5787,4.5413,0.8418,5.0225,2.684,2.1178,3.4308,0.0726,0.8014,1.1826,3.1846,1.1611,2.0042,3.3837,4.0115,3.6258,6.038,0.4663,0.5783,0.6724,1.949,0.3852,4.099,4.6631,0.0372,0.7382,1.5374,3.264,2.336,0.5446,0.9286,3.038,3.4442,0.0205,0.8215,0.4502,3.0188,6.8767,2.3599,7.1888,0.0004,0.0008,7.1479,2.7035,1.1137,0.9487,4.8595,0.147,2.9112,0.3886,6.3288,2.8384,1.8589,1.512,6.6773,0.7051,2.4351,0.8203,3.3457,2.5237,1.4546,3.8045,2.04,0.6911,3.0337,4.8894,1.3826,7.5104,1.1114,1.7173,1.3205,4.9569,3.4811,0.1621,1.499,5.4472,2.4759,5.0404,0.7,0.9408,2.6978,1.0212,0.001,0.1244,0.9206,1.5666,4.1431,1.9625,3.3512,1.4368,1.413,0.0769,10.086,5.449,2.6615,2.2899,7.1986,1.6386,5.2666,0.17,3.6378,6.4442,6.6094,1.1955,3.1373,0.0176,4.2765,3.2104,4.5994,5.9462,1.1253,2.1182,0.0421,2.5644,0.3523,0.4905,0.7753,5.984,0.9483,4.216,4.2567,5.408,0.97,1.3402,1.448,1.0288,2.6446,0.3262,1.9832,0.4752,0.9726,2.3716,3.0494,1.2235,0.2441,0.0921,0.0503,0.4717]}

It made its closest approach to the planet on 8 July 2000 at a distance of 2.23 astronomical units, or approximately 1.5 million kilometres (900 miles). The resulting image, known as the Cassini Orbiter Photograph of Jupiter (COPI-JO ), shows close-ups of the aurora, plasma, and winds. The images provide many surprises! The COPI-JO images show that Jupiter has an active and volatile auroral zone, far from what had been expected from theoretical work. The images also reveal that the aurora and its electromagnetic emissions are located at the high latitudes.\nIn addition, the image reveals an unexpectedly strong ring current. The polar winds near Jupiter's north pole are so strong that they may actually be responsible for tapping the plasma from the auroral zone and drawing it out to infinity. In the past, it had often been assumed that because the magnetic axis is near the low latitudes, no ring current would exist. The discovery of a high-latitude ring current has had implications for understanding the interaction of the magnetosphere with the atmosphere. The wind velocity at the poles appears to be on the order of 500 km s '. That is equivalent to a velocity of nearly 1500 kilometres per second!

{"prompt":"Floyd was first tracked as a tropical depression on September 3 when it organized east of the Leeward Islands . As the depression moved northwest , it caused heavy rain . The highest rainfall reported","text":"Floyd was first tracked as a tropical depression on September 3 when it organized east of the Leeward Islands. As the depression moved northwest, it caused heavy rain. The highest rainfall reported was 2,000 millimeters (79\u00a0inches) at Luperon; however, there were reported total daily rainfall amounts up to 3,000 millimeters (120\u00a0inches) over both the western and southern islands. The storm struck the Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of up to 65\u00a0km\/h (40\u00a0mph) and heavy rain that caused torrential floods in parts of eastern Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, where two people lost their lives. Although the National Hurricane Center downgraded the system to a tropical depression, the system remained in a hurricane warning between the Bahamas and Florida. In the Bahamas however, it became a Category 1 hurricane that caused catastrophic flooding in eastern and southern The Bahamas. The hurricane left four dead in Florida and a person killed in Louisiana. In January 1997, Flounder made landfall in the Florida Panhandle in a hurricane warning zone. While the hurricane caused wind damage in southeastern Florida, there was no fatalities. The United States National Hurricane Center assigned the strongest category of five to the storm.\n\nFinal impact\n\nWhile the storm was still a remnant, it was back off the West Coast of the United States and over the southern United Kingdom, at which time it began to weaken. Flounder eventually weakened to tropical storm strength on September 11. The final remnants of the system moved off of Florida on September 13.\n\nPreparations\n\nWhile Flounder formed far from the United States coast, there were some preparations made by the state of Florida. Florida Emergency Management Agency (FEM) President Frank Foley stated that the agency was prepared for any hurricane-related situation in the state, although he did not think that the storm was any greater than any of the cyclones that had previously struck the state. \nOn September 8, the U.S. government issued a national natural disaster declaration for Florida. The following day on September 9, Florida declared a state of emergency. On September 27, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security declared Florida's counties of Charlotte, Lee, Collier, and Sarasota as disaster areas. The storm also caused extensive storm surge flooding at the Port of Miami.","token_len":476,"entropy":[10.4866,4.3168,5.8903,8.6321,5.5529,0.6653,8.785,5.8033,3.454,3.3406,3.5747,5.9464,2.7035,12.4288,10.2257,3.1083,1.351,8.5243,1.5807,0.0043,0.1588,1.482,4.3317,1.7086,4.6462,2.8672,3.683,1.3772,1.6584,5.7625,3.9854,1.77,3.2573,2.106,6.6412,1.9845,6.718,1.7742,3.6504,2.1386,3.2605,4.4741,0.2374,0.9254,8.2271,14.1345,2.58,0.5398,2.1958,8.6892,7.6273,7.101,6.5282,3.4223,0.0877,3.7792,1.051,6.0277,7.2421,5.7698,0.9892,5.1222,4.3097,0.0072,2.9273,0.116,0.668,0.4434,0.0039,0.1588,5.6761,0.1504,0.0367,0.8874,3.8939,6.4923,2.3932,5.5154,0.4631,1.6658,3.3722,0.4043,1.7079,3.867,5.1238,2.5902,7.1186,0.0763,4.6991,5.5333,0.4867,0.3101,0.2441,3.7611,0.1097,3.9159,1.7417,3.9672,0.581,0.0395,0.2854,2.6797,0.2225,1.1583,0.8303,0.844,4.4677,0.8593,4.7417,3.6266,6.4525,0.0165,8.2339,2.127,3.4859,0.0044,4.9017,11.2556,2.8085,0.0375,0.0001,0.0038,12.1756,0.1616,1.6381,4.2662,5.6066,2.7136,3.9316,0.2021,0.1974,0.3342,5.2046,1.2317,4.4264,1.7379,0.0504,7.3364,0.2119,0.355,6.7011,0.5114,0.6908,0.5369,1.7168,0.7702,1.6042,5.4284,3.3288,2.443,2.4241,4.2873,4.3472,9.6033,2.238,5.6653,0.1411,3.2397,0.8844,3.1378,1.4545,4.3026,8.111,0.0641,2.6189,3.0929,0.9858,2.1604,2.5867,0.6244,4.5505,3.3096,5.3349,0.4992,1.1793,6.0059,3.9488,1.4534,6.9183,0.2448,0.841,1.6421,2.4021,5.1851,5.2338,1.7752,2.6972,4.1505,1.4389,3.2776,5.5451,3.918,0.588,4.1489,0.4425,2.5032,6.1406,4.2172,0.3427,8.5298,6.2377,0.1068,5.2493,0.1455,0.7604,0.9387,4.1624,3.6576,0.0012,3.64,2.0947,3.2604,2.2711,4.6531,1.4288,4.8704,1.4713,1.7841,4.7017,6.4975,1.3079,1.5159,4.8477,1.2676,0.2296,3.7999,1.1798,0.5058,6.6135,1.6117,1.7361,5.3028,0.0749,1.9833,0.2254,0.0085,6.587,1.3906,6.3018,3.8818,2.3231,8.0134,1.3002,0.8933,1.8109,1.2724,2.8629,7.079,8.1989,9.5639,1.6304,0.0009,4.3875,1.1465,1.8812,1.9582,2.3397,3.2905,7.1993,2.3061,1.215,1.5089,6.816,8.0534,0.8873,5.1954,0.0234,2.5796,0.3521,0.4734,0.0043,1.7992,5.7147,0.9837,3.6263,2.4916,4.2048,2.1873,5.73,4.1636,1.6824,0.8908,3.4183,0.6731,2.8336,0.8682,4.7643,0.1477,0.0041,5.0679,3.3251,0.9961,5.0098,1.6318,2.7747,3.3256,1.9141,2.9787,2.1183,1.8118,5.3973,4.0672,0.2734,0.6282,5.1347,4.2329,4.77,3.0091,2.7937,2.9708,0.5746,2.1535,1.4712,1.4812,0.0009,6.666,1.8314,0.5765,1.8703,0.0002,4.1869,2.8128,0.0063,0.0026,5.967,8.3029,1.5748,0.7389,4.7716,0.044,4.7757,0.54,3.0801,0.4779,2.291,1.6236,3.3137,2.3151,0.9076,4.6493,1.2024,0.6248,1.2698,3.8919,4.9367,0.1787,1.9868,1.276,0.6306,4.4549,3.7301,5.6423,4.5991,7.603,4.3305,0.8347,1.5682,3.2198,1.4424,3.1626,1.4227,2.9928,3.6688,4.3631,1.5267,3.7607,2.1473,0.7378,2.0359,1.8475,4.3203,1.5883,1.1889,0.1722,6.1417,1.1933,1.5605,1.8127,1.935,5.2372,4.542,0.5044,4.1264,2.9497,0.3545,6.8505,0.2493,1.1206,1.4419,3.8555,2.9052,1.1052,0.8517,0.3379,7.5223,6.5259,17.4548,0.4383,3.8053,0.2381,1.9317,3.7332,0.0049,0.0109,0.0051,4.6415,1.6292,0.6834,4.3653,9.1379,0.0289,0.4116,1.535,1.2003,1.0738,1.5574,4.2599,0.305,5.3633,0.1364,1.636,0.1705,2.4641,4.6817,0.6659,0.8423,0.1094,0.0286,1.608,2.685,0.3417,6.3632,0.1534,1.2031,1.45,0.0006,0.0037,0.0019,4.3578,0.0022,2.9015,0.0011,4.3628,2.8262,2.2995,8.0392,2.6208,7.6115,0.5159,6.1565,0.4481,7.3864,0.4064,0.2447,1.9287,4.8014,0.0002,1.5619,3.9928,0.6137,0.5132,2.3195,5.0796,3.0898,2.229,3.4692,5.1775,0.9062,3.1608,4.2281,1.7694,4.9018,0.3532,1.5813,1.1543]}

Juan and his third wife, Isabel, decided to keep the body covered and sealed in their home and not to return to Argentina at that time. In 1973, Juan Per\u00f3n's body was flown back to Argentina, and on 19 July 1974, he was interred at the Escritorios de L\u00f3pez Anaya cemetery in Recoleta. As of 2015, his grave is guarded by more than 2,000 people.\nDuring military dictatorship ( 1976-2003), Juan Per\u00f3n and his family were not permitted at all to come back to Argentina nor were allowed to leave the country. The state used a variety of tactics to prevent Juan Per\u00f3n and his supporters from returning to Argentine politics. For example, Juan Per\u00f3n's son, Carlos Nair Per\u00f3n, was imprisoned for twenty years. Many Per\u00f3n's former followers were barred from practicing political activity, and others were exiled or otherwise prevented from returning. In 1992, Per\u00f3n's son, C\u00e9sar Milani, was kidnapped and murdered, possibly by Argentina's military secret services. Per\u00f3n's former aide, Mar\u00eda Estela Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n, went on hunger strike in 2006 demanding a trial against the former military dictatorship. In 2011, the Argentine government began legal proceedings to remove all names on Per\u00f3n's tomb, saying that his remains were too closely linked to the military. The Per\u00f3n family eventually returned to Argentina in December 2011, and Per\u00f3n's daughter Patricia Per\u00f3n, as well as his granddaughter Victoria Tolosa Paz, ran for the presidency in the 2015 elections. They received 6.5% and 4.5% of the vote, respectively. In April 2016, the Per\u00f3n family filed an appeal with the National Election Committee, asking for a recount of ballots.\n^ a b c d e f g h i \"Juan Per\u00f3n\". The World Factbook (in Spanish).

The UTMB has grown to be a vital and growing medical, public health and research university in Texas, as well as one of the nation\u2019s top medical centers.\nAlthough UTMB is primarily a public research institution, the medical school also has a Private Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program ( D.O. \/ MD ) in place that students can enroll in during their first year of admission. The school\u2019s medical and health professions schools have one of the few residency training opportunities for pediatric neurologists in Texas.\nThe School of Medicine at UTMB is committed to offering a quality learning experience for all of the students it enrolls. Students are welcome to enroll in the University\u2019s Private Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program ( D.O. \/ MD ) which offers a full year of instruction in both clinical and classroom environments. The course of study includes coursework on anatomy and physiology, biostatistics, critical decision making, clinical trials, medical ethics, pharmacology, psychiatry, psychological assessment, nutrition and metabolism, radiology and internal medicine.\nAll aspects of medical school are relevant to the D.O. \/ MD program because it\u2019s a combined program. Students do not have to choose specialties before they begin their studies, however students must still complete the required courses in certain specialties such as psychiatry to fulfill the majority of the educational requirements.\nThe educational program has three options for students who wish to pursue a D.O. \/ MD degree. The first option is to follow the traditional course of study and complete all undergraduate requirements before transferring to the graduate school. The second option would be to complete all required courses before entering the graduate school. The third option is to choose a clinical track of study.\nThe school offers clinical rotation opportunities to all freshman students at one of seven medical centers located throughout Texas, including Houston, and Galveston Bay. The course of study includes courses such as ethics, research design and methodologies, epidemiology, medical writing and other required courses.

they are not, however, without valuable features, and many valuable and useful books have been brought forward by them with the knowledge and confidence of men who, without an intimate acquaintance with all the particular statements contained in them, are, for various local reasons, unable to make use of the publication.\nBut as the object of the book is not to lay the foundation of a science but to present certain facts on a general scale, then those parts of the Workmans which may have a theoretical bearing on mineralogy, geology and similar subjects are to be regarded as belonging to the more comprehensive field of geography, for which the Workmans have very fully established a position, and which is not limited to any particular locality.\nThe author has therefore to draw largely on the literature concerning geography relating to the British Isles ; a fact which he deems to be the result of inadequate methods of description, or the result of the attempt to make uniform statements in the absence of uniformity in the descriptive instruments used, thus rendering the work of others quite incomprehensible.\nHe wishes to point out that the work dealt with in this book does not, strictly speaking, include what is called \" hydrogeology, \" that is the science of water ; it embraces those subjects which may be regarded as its natural results.\nThere are those who maintain that geography has no relation with the science of the waters of the earth, that we have no knowledge of them, or only a knowledge of too little, because we do not have the right theory to determine the true causes ; that, in fact, geography is a science of accidents...\nWhen the watery nature of the earth is made a subject of discussion, it is obvious that some of the most important features of geography are lost sight of, and it would appear that certain men, of whose zeal many of us have to be justly proud, have taken it for granted that geography and hydrogeology were different subjects altogether...\nA science of geography is a science of truth, therefore of reality, it must be in the first instance a subject of investigation and study purely historical, and it is to that science that the writer of this work has turned.\n\n","token_len":477,"entropy":[7.1553,6.4729,2.1229,1.9634,6.8551,0.6596,1.5829,9.9755,6.3533,2.2701,13.0204,11.6398,4.3928,5.1475,6.5098,0.0096,9.2826,1.636,5.5805,2.8198,3.8255,8.2221,1.3733,2.4583,1.9438,2.2304,3.4385,9.353,1.2504,3.4929,9.4764,1.2932,4.2655,3.8569,3.5335,1.8751,6.387,2.4428,1.302,2.4176,4.6578,1.7566,0.0018,5.5007,6.4198,5.6346,1.7814,1.6313,3.9903,6.0555,4.5625,1.8223,3.4425,2.6666,0.3249,5.3809,4.4641,1.6007,2.4199,5.2038,1.6377,4.2381,1.634,4.9109,0.5213,5.9675,1.2201,4.5352,3.6542,5.2427,5.5419,1.8796,0.3509,5.7933,0.8875,8.0673,9.1763,2.9124,0.3508,1.4489,0.1037,2.5657,5.0202,3.0313,5.7357,8.5595,3.1749,0.0857,2.7959,0.195,2.837,3.0334,0.0241,1.9049,8.2611,2.5245,2.6552,9.9412,3.7066,2.2539,6.6765,0.2838,0.9572,3.3803,0.8512,1.9044,0.5493,6.5454,2.1092,3.5217,0.6806,1.3235,6.3913,3.5016,0.5356,5.1988,7.3084,0.964,3.9258,2.0658,2.2471,2.3864,0.4037,5.7911,5.6436,6.0886,0.8399,0.5217,6.9247,0.185,1.2449,3.0186,2.8054,3.076,6.4809,3.8995,1.0134,8.6266,0.7162,1.3002,2.9406,0.1082,2.1083,8.7725,1.1596,1.3485,2.6583,0.0791,2.1091,0.4751,5.6283,0.3659,0.7245,5.9417,5.119,3.1634,0.3952,5.0045,1.3247,4.2249,2.4799,1.5615,2.7062,0.0168,1.3726,5.2485,6.8105,5.0692,2.546,4.0046,2.1993,1.3799,1.8575,2.3914,2.9284,4.0509,0.3074,3.6694,0.8429,1.9842,0.9653,1.1778,1.4148,5.8687,2.6833,5.4499,3.9175,5.2798,8.3032,1.9546,0.8582,5.714,6.9867,5.3862,8.8585,0.193,1.0499,5.5408,0.5574,5.6373,4.5572,3.7817,0.3082,2.0764,6.7246,1.7471,0.2219,3.7721,5.5106,0.0374,8.116,5.0873,1.2011,6.1614,1.3115,3.1399,3.2132,3.5511,0.0601,2.0417,5.4038,0.9576,2.7372,7.4501,4.8222,2.8061,1.8765,4.9038,0.0045,4.6058,2.5461,1.6959,0.9564,5.4368,7.0895,1.4199,2.5939,6.4045,3.1299,1.0501,2.0532,2.6803,5.9297,4.425,4.3307,0.5674,0.8651,3.0519,5.307,0.369,3.782,0.0941,1.2951,1.1459,1.4633,8.4626,0.1311,1.4336,0.7926,0.8629,3.5769,0.1382,3.009,5.5529,0.0667,0.0086,3.6644,6.343,1.1448,1.7546,3.7606,10.4367,1.5302,0.7614,2.6473,3.2661,4.9797,0.3609,3.3793,4.5804,0.5324,4.599,5.2106,1.8539,6.7302,5.2135,4.0565,0.7455,3.9962,0.6709,3.0126,0.2094,7.0014,4.7281,6.6659,1.7654,1.6905,3.8638,0.8501,4.9623,0.8105,4.117,0.2333,6.1474,2.8803,2.212,3.2044,3.6959,1.7582,4.2191,0.1491,2.8499,6.6515,2.5723,0.379,2.5926,0.8238,2.4573,5.2297,2.1089,1.853,2.6096,0.1564,2.2153,0.5544,2.4895,5.7627,2.8091,3.8959,0.1006,9.8052,1.6713,1.846,3.9993,1.5341,1.8856,0.0143,2.6116,1.5894,4.6288,7.6071,1.8925,3.8623,1.5287,4.8794,4.4002,6.6386,1.4013,2.87,2.0091,1.4163,0.0053,3.2568,0.8323,1.7614,2.256,1.3732,7.6951,8.0331,1.8382,5.6042,1.8773,4.9324,6.5277,5.9,0.1121,0.3934,1.5137,0.7794,5.4912,3.6473,1.7171,0.4701,3.3009,0.592,1.5748,0.5546,5.5701,0.2554,4.301,1.4868,0.2911,3.3608,1.4536,3.5929,0.4823,2.0014,0.7606,5.0239,6.8889,0.0244,1.2297,0.8255,4.3848,3.2727,3.0559,0.6002,6.1449,6.578,2.031,4.9193,4.6198,8.4869,4.1486,2.2665,3.2262,1.6743,5.8771,1.4603,7.6482,0.4926,2.2513,0.1581,1.0819,3.6778,3.4666,2.1479,0.084,0.23,3.8329,4.012,2.3209,0.0087,0.0087,1.6955,6.1137,2.0148,5.1218,5.018,0.5425,4.0242,6.4713,0.9144,2.8191,1.4055,2.3888,0.8872,0.3312,8.7676,0.8261,7.1527,5.0499,5.1126,0.5775,5.6289,3.0912,0.597,5.5474,1.4517,4.5418,2.1926,1.8021,3.717,0.3,3.516,1.9403,3.2299,10.8188,7.2495,0.9324,0.9634,2.7838,1.9886,3.8583,2.7715,4.4846,1.696,1.0825,6.161,2.4103,0.2758,1.6987,2.7875,6.8067,0.9918,5.5078]}

The historical Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre , the Field Marshal of Ayacucho , had been the most trusted general","text":"Field Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre is portrayed as an intimate friend of the General. The historical Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, the Field Marshal of Ayacucho, had been the most trusted general in the army of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and was one of the most outstanding figures in the final years of the independence struggle in South America. General de la Serna appears to support him politically in, but they are actually old friends and not romantic partners.\nAfter the battle of Ayacucho, Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre ascended to the rank of general of division and was appointed general and commander of the new Venezuelan army.\nThe battle was lost. He is not given a single photograph in this book, and when General MacGregor asks him about his photographs of the battle, his response is somewhat cryptic, suggesting that they might possibly be in possession of the British archives:.\nGeneral Santa Lucia, when the Battle of Ayacucho began, held a large force on the southern bank above the plain, although the bulk of infantry of the Army of the Andes had remained in camp on the river, waiting for orders.\nWhen the final assault was launched, the two formations of the Spanish army, comprising the Spanish National Corps, Spanish Auxiliary Corps and Royal Artillery, found their way across the lower river bed, through a narrow ravine cut in the rock of the escarpment and thus reached the river near the southern shore.\nThey crossed the river by throwing down rocks and earth from above, and with the help of the American artillery. They marched on and joined the main army under General Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre during the Battle of Ayacucho, taking the name of First National Division.\nThe Royal Army of Spain also suffered a serious loss with the death of General Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, whose body was transported across the river to Guayaquil for his funeral.\nHowever, General Sucre left his photograph on this monument as a clear reference to the battle and in commemoration of his contribution to the independence of Colombia. Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, in fact, gave most of his money and his personal savings in a single day to the purchase of gunpowder, supplies, and muskets for the Colombian army, and contributed in other ways to help the new republic in its war of independence against Spain.","token_len":478,"entropy":[11.6805,12.8792,8.0094,3.9691,9.315,0.7545,4.8094,8.0102,2.3911,2.7669,8.1193,2.2004,0.5192,1.8518,8.1119,1.9535,2.6142,8.9721,11.5088,1.5893,0.2196,0.0023,0.0015,2.5414,3.0039,8.8032,0.0121,0.6215,9.4753,2.7807,0.2481,0.0688,0.7441,4.4458,1.3947,2.9078,3.9506,4.0786,5.3803,0.6175,0.7256,2.9056,1.8281,12.9307,0.5072,0.4299,0.4526,0.0002,2.3804,1.7687,3.5816,0.0208,0.2416,1.4893,6.2271,5.0057,0.6569,0.5101,8.7465,2.7968,0.0284,0.3637,6.0981,1.638,3.5574,4.8933,0.1045,0.1684,6.6157,2.0804,12.6481,5.0034,5.0691,0.1114,7.6991,0.9909,7.6403,4.9129,6.4583,3.2294,9.1265,2.6302,6.3476,1.6168,6.0873,9.2363,0.7023,2.2977,4.3227,8.2711,2.7062,0.3359,1.3401,7.5655,0.7966,4.3947,0.7195,3.4742,0.0057,0.0017,0.0016,0.5476,3.7564,0.5094,0.073,0.0088,0.0027,8.3141,0.6484,0.438,0.6343,0.0065,3.5299,2.1667,9.9007,2.4781,2.0458,3.0121,2.9559,4.9737,2.0779,0.2961,0.4309,5.7016,8.3882,0.749,0.5142,2.788,1.9144,4.6696,3.4422,6.2847,2.7983,4.4744,3.6189,3.4925,4.3939,1.5918,3.6423,5.2528,3.2218,3.6066,1.4247,1.7428,2.4626,4.5045,6.4825,7.7571,3.7561,0.0024,4.9309,1.269,2.4145,2.0166,4.2277,3.1864,0.9951,1.0846,0.6082,3.7699,2.1554,0.162,5.9609,4.146,2.5437,5.9042,0.47,3.7555,3.2149,5.7597,1.0125,4.5393,6.6139,0.0907,2.3158,6.8912,2.3773,5.0507,9.5363,0.6368,3.6124,11.4734,5.7613,2.6858,4.9691,4.0896,4.1219,0.0956,0.3661,0.0007,0.0015,0.0007,2.7357,0.5296,5.6473,1.5933,4.5181,6.4617,3.6134,0.6726,4.5699,4.8681,9.3078,0.9674,6.4221,2.0179,5.7369,2.147,5.4662,0.0446,9.4787,4.973,0.3877,4.4705,0.5367,1.3947,7.2207,0.2425,2.5249,4.9071,1.3953,5.5781,3.3929,0.3872,4.3582,3.057,5.9329,0.3849,4.8713,1.911,2.6564,3.6588,0.8407,6.4034,3.6267,1.4357,2.4078,0.8328,1.4713,5.6507,5.9216,1.3234,0.5682,3.6907,1.4883,2.2707,5.8551,1.224,3.725,4.2158,7.2796,1.586,4.7079,5.9884,0.9234,1.6165,1.0108,5.3622,4.3079,0.0008,0.7658,6.0173,3.2382,1.1793,3.7882,0.1913,6.5958,3.4025,7.6873,1.6096,3.5624,1.9785,2.2669,3.5934,0.0053,6.3269,2.0156,1.3404,5.2662,2.5517,0.4826,6.6107,0.0159,0.0102,2.6656,7.6004,5.4862,0.6005,4.4205,5.9584,0.6968,6.0575,3.9389,1.0745,1.2525,3.9313,3.3495,0.7552,2.5751,4.0423,6.5615,3.3342,3.0504,1.2735,8.1366,2.7666,2.2837,1.2308,1.3421,4.7582,1.4238,1.2854,0.0029,1.742,5.3971,2.0077,6.9012,2.5995,5.3145,2.2914,3.2679,6.8382,0.6226,5.2778,2.6141,4.5726,0.7719,3.918,0.9705,0.1151,0.0606,0.0027,6.1251,0.3448,4.0498,0.0496,0.175,0.0006,0.0021,0.0009,1.818,4.77,2.0293,7.2356,0.5409,8.6046,5.0751,4.3907,1.0631,0.6273,1.4496,6.4613,2.8515,0.7012,2.1363,5.048,4.4301,1.8428,4.1983,1.9244,5.3552,0.7813,4.8506,0.0316,1.3523,2.9805,0.5166,0.0599,0.0275,0.0029,1.7998,4.5598,2.0637,0.2919,4.5751,5.4442,0.1414,1.3797,1.6251,5.4523,2.297,0.0077,0.0052,3.6692,4.8112,0.786,0.5575,0.7559,4.9583,0.0781,2.3549,6.9579,0.004,5.8099,1.9958,9.5847,2.4912,5.5083,5.7469,3.7552,1.0859,7.1623,3.5731,0.4586,1.4504,2.3309,2.2622,4.6614,5.1781,0.0005,0.1063,1.2143,4.7302,0.3551,0.2777,3.6428,2.7186,3.5031,0.4382,8.5863,0.1565,0.0184,0.0018,0.004,3.1419,3.1476,2.8766,0.0857,5.0219,6.2842,0.0662,0.2656,5.4877,2.4433,2.6069,3.0434,7.2997,3.5284,2.7139,4.1895,3.5004,1.8412,0.7908,8.98,0.1701,9.2978,0.1357,2.0485,6.1515,1.2073,1.7262,8.3698,0.4176,0.0028,1.9567,0.45,4.8406,0.8519,1.9473,1.5779,7.0343,3.5452,4.4039,0.4758,0.4585,4.4535,1.2369,4.5336,5.3789,3.3655,1.3299,2.9168,4.3365,0.1396,3.5888,2.0658,0.3605]}

Later, House signed for West Bromwich Albion on transfer deadline day on 10 January 1998, for an initial fee of \u00a3 500,000 (now \u00a3 28.4 million).  West Bromwich Albion went on to win the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup Winners Cup (against Sevilla, defeating the competition in the final).  During his career at West Bromwich Albion, House was a part of the team, who reached the semi-finals of the 2000\u20132001 FA Cup (against Chelsea, losing 0\u20132 on aggregate), although he was an unused substitute for both legs.  House left West Bromwich on loan to Norwich City in 2002 (at the age of 22), a club that was at the peak of their ability and was winning promotion.  He made a total of 37 appearances for the Norwich team, scoring once in the process.\nHouse left Norwich on transfer deadline day in 2003, and signed for newly promoted Sheffield United. He made his debut against Liverpool in the Premier League at Old Trafford, on 9 November 2004.

Most of these musicals have shown up a run on Broadway before. This year, we have three of them: `` An American in Paris '', \\\" \\\" In the Heights \\\" and \\\" A Little Night Music \\\".\n`` An American in Paris \\\" is probably my all-time favorite musical, because it is so beautifully lyric and melodic, so smartly written and full of wit. When I first heard the script, I was hooked. I couldn't believe how brilliant it was! The whole thing is so well made, so witty and poignant, I think we could all identify with it. I'm also pleased that we are presenting the musical to an audience that is not so familiar with it, because that will help it sell more tickets, for sure! If it is well received, the 5th will definitely commission an adaptation of the musical for Broadway, or even a TV show. As far as I can see, there have been no complaints so far, and I think that is why we decided to go ahead with the production. I look forward to hearing your honest, thoughtful reactions to the first performance this Thursday night! Thank you for your attention! \"\"\nThe musical features original score by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, direction by David F. Sandberg and Choreography by Sandy Douglas. The production was directed by David F. Sandberg, choreographed by Sandy Douglas and directed by David F. Sandberg. Rodgers and Hammerstein II wrote the songs, which appear to be set based on the actual letters of people who experienced the events while they were performing on Broadway in the 1960s (the title is the name of the musical in French).\nThe cast features Jennifer Shepherd as Sally Bowles ( a girl who, with her husband's help, sets up a clothing boutique in Paris ), Andrew Currie as Richard ( a wealthy American gentleman who is in Paris as the American Ambassador and is going to Paris as a tourist to support her in business ), Peter Levin as Frederick Bliss ( a young American businessman who is in Paris to attend a charity gala ), and Anthony Ramos as David ( a handsome French reporter who goes to the American Embassy for a story ).","token_len":479,"entropy":[2.3024,6.88,0.0367,0.9166,8.8303,1.0256,5.1693,13.2898,1.5996,5.2383,0.8861,4.7891,0.1159,1.245,4.9322,0.078,5.6941,6.1321,2.2402,3.6696,0.3165,4.6886,1.5345,12.0159,16.2498,0.4164,6.2247,0.4677,2.8347,1.4201,2.0521,7.1569,1.366,4.8584,1.71,2.162,1.6555,0.379,0.3971,5.9376,1.2077,2.379,2.8699,0.0337,1.1656,5.8642,1.2809,6.5484,9.4965,4.5363,0.8677,2.8121,3.9388,3.9387,2.8239,0.7125,3.4751,2.2314,4.1912,1.9093,1.3175,2.2003,3.4233,8.7542,2.9498,6.1866,3.0354,4.8573,4.5218,8.9846,8.4616,5.3305,1.3278,2.976,4.7311,0.2088,1.1276,4.0073,3.2195,3.8772,6.4585,5.1953,3.3597,2.8329,10.1627,2.9219,0.0567,0.0448,0.0093,3.6204,2.2072,5.6884,3.4815,6.0632,0.4507,0.0075,0.0462,1.0877,1.8677,3.4525,0.4099,1.8014,2.3734,4.6253,10.2127,1.1167,4.7361,0.6154,1.1553,3.8724,6.777,1.7465,1.7404,1.329,5.2018,0.0133,5.6692,1.1436,5.4017,1.3324,1.5438,0.6181,2.0363,5.2042,0.9011,0.3372,1.4281,3.3944,0.5888,1.5423,4.1709,0.0073,1.155,1.4086,5.2881,1.1063,0.4101,2.5138,2.3243,4.0391,1.9075,1.1671,1.4647,3.1478,3.6605,1.2489,1.932,4.7508,0.8787,5.2639,0.9667,4.0195,3.7933,4.2516,2.3451,0.7662,7.2153,0.1849,0.6512,0.7671,1.9184,2.5451,4.0997,5.7146,1.3154,2.7949,2.5049,6.5076,1.7923,3.2155,3.0022,3.8125,0.7863,2.0839,1.7535,2.5327,3.3536,1.6482,0.04,1.8827,1.4698,2.297,2.9469,3.3355,2.5116,3.2578,4.0852,0.7428,0.3377,2.5362,4.834,2.2674,2.5082,4.865,2.9369,2.4808,5.199,1.5717,0.6659,3.1306,3.2929,0.0055,1.8781,4.8626,14.259,2.212,4.2347,1.239,1.033,3.2637,3.1051,1.4988,1.8639,4.2466,2.8587,1.6216,4.9552,1.2634,0.9515,4.5284,2.6729,0.0062,1.6573,1.8878,3.0746,0.1827,2.6901,4.0148,0.3418,0.5623,4.676,4.0663,0.0006,1.9604,1.2216,1.6073,2.3242,2.3014,2.551,4.0829,1.4025,4.4298,0.1171,3.1817,1.3729,0.8703,1.0392,1.8575,1.0522,2.2336,4.5947,0.0009,0.0031,2.1251,3.2245,8.9155,3.3491,2.9102,4.6922,0.7533,1.036,4.7834,4.4344,5.4587,6.5277,2.6616,2.3233,3.9357,0.0254,1.0755,0.7305,4.6112,2.2165,8.3038,1.2939,2.4336,3.6032,5.2082,5.7553,3.0652,0.5483,4.6956,5.2099,1.3901,5.7399,4.9533,0.0373,7.378,1.0345,10.7449,0.2864,3.6359,4.5106,2.009,6.0179,0.9478,1.2068,8.1434,4.4578,1.859,0.5474,8.5241,8.2584,0.6793,1.447,2.5383,2.2535,3.5577,0.0654,3.2645,2.6817,0.0245,0.1807,0.0039,1.1385,6.038,0.9798,0.0292,3.3917,0.0389,1.0513,3.4711,0.014,2.2496,0.9319,0.0055,0.0196,0.004,0.3773,9.2217,0.6934,0.0971,0.0008,2.4008,3.9573,0.7503,5.0481,1.7724,2.1207,5.7442,3.0373,0.6018,6.0657,8.2845,0.1267,0.9323,5.1822,6.5638,1.1651,8.5229,0.9986,7.9426,0.9174,3.2675,7.8919,2.196,0.2678,3.3214,3.3166,0.3448,1.7308,0.9307,3.0918,0.2548,5.0628,2.5588,5.8481,2.8205,3.4273,5.2101,0.1369,0.8246,1.672,2.9268,6.644,0.7265,2.2468,1.3217,3.791,4.6501,6.7927,9.6041,2.1855,6.2014,6.9321,0.6818,2.3492,9.144,5.7571,0.8306,4.1423,4.0226,0.9924,2.5181,3.1954,0.5949,0.0778,6.0067,1.1712,0.7613,8.4744,4.8252,1.0674,2.1064,3.8617,5.9816,8.277,1.5821,0.1467,4.4002,2.838,0.8442,4.6171,4.7934,5.4639,0.5194,2.5775,3.6776,3.1159,4.3322,2.3318,5.7997,5.0422,3.4544,2.7184,5.6701,0.2641,2.8709,2.5736,1.1364,3.4456,2.5725,5.6362,4.4721,5.1709,6.4477,2.1789,5.3629,8.5815,0.2832,7.0481,10.6413,0.327,0.586,2.6766,2.3407,3.1207,0.5031,1.2976,1.898,0.1364,2.5728,4.1367,1.1201,4.8415,6.7179,0.001,2.2273,1.6898,5.8391,7.7574,0.4797,4.7009,1.4305,0.5583,5.2951,2.5844,6.8657,0.541,4.3474,0.7645,2.6295,4.3267,0.4726,3.5034,1.5347,3.6976,3.7017]}

It became a tropical depression on August 30 near the Yucatan Peninsula and entered the eastern Atlantic in the days to follow.\nTropical depression 17-E came close to the east coast of Mexico in late August, which was much rarer than expected, but did not affect Mexico. More rare are hurricanes originating far offshore in western North and Central America. In the year 2005, the northern North Atlantic was affected by two major hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, with origins in the United States. After some time, these hurricanes had developed into extratropical cyclones over the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, respectively, before making landfall in the U.S. Midwest.\nThe year 2008 brought four major hurricanes: the most intense Harvey reached hurricane force over Texas on August 30 and formed from deep convection originating on land in western Saudi Arabia. Other major hurricanes hit Cuba on August 4 and the Bahamas on August 7 with wind speeds of 105 km \/ h (65 mph) and 90 km \/ h (56 mph), respectively, over the Bahamas.\nIn 2012, the northern North Atlantic was hit by two of the most intense hurricanes in the northern North Atlantic since the start of record keeping in 1851: Sandy, which started in the southern Gulf of Mexico in a tropical wave that had passed into the Atlantic and then turned into an tropical depression over the Gulf of Mexico. On the same night, Sandy was a tropical depression. A second cyclone formed from the tropical wave and moved to the northern North Atlantic close to the North Sea.\nIn 2015, the northeast Atlantic Ocean was hit by the most intense storm ever recorded in the northern Atlantic Ocean: Category 5 Hurricane Rita, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast on August 4. After some time, the storm reached hurricane force over northern Mexico and then the Central States and then moved to the Gulf Coast.\nIn 2016, northern North Atlantic was affected by the most intense hurricane ever recorded since 1851. Category 5 Hurricane Harvey formed in the Gulf of Mexico on August 30; it reached hurricane force over Texas on August 4.

Winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour ( 56 to 72 km per hour) blew into the region and produced waves of 3 to 5 feet ( 1 to 1.5 meters) high. On Christmas Day, a wave of 6 feet (2.1 meters) broke over a low point near Middletown, Kent County, Virginia, resulting in major flooding and damage. Many homes sustained roof damage. By Friday afternoon, flooding had occurred in numerous areas of the Lowcountry. The damage from the storm led to the death of seven people in the Tidewater region. An estimated $5 million in damage occurred in the eastern coastal counties and $1.3 million in damage in central Virginia alone. In the northeastern sections of the state, wind gusts brought in a mix of rain, snow and sleet. However, no flooding occurred.\nA second snowstorm struck the eastern United States, peaking Sunday morning. A low pressure system centered over eastern Mexico brought deepening northeasterly winds that dumped snow into the Gulf and northern Plains states, followed by rain and sleet into the East and Midwest. An accumulation of from 3 inches (7 centimeters) to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of snow was recorded in a few regions of New England, the Southeast and New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine. Wind gusts as high as 65 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour) occurred in New York, resulting in waves of 3 to 4 feet (1 1 to 1.5 meters) breaking over sandy beaches in southern New Jersey. High winds also blew the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in New York City; more than 1 million vehicles and heavy vehicles were reported stuck in the flood, which occurred on the night of New Year's Eve.

Most of Spanish America had gained independence by this date ; but the remainder were yet to be free.\n\" The war in the West Indies had been fought, and the English were victorious.\nBut the war in the Old World, especially in Mexico, had only just begun.\nMexico now remained under Spanish rule. \"\nThe author has provided an excellent summary of the history of Mexico and Central America since the period of the first conquest.\nThe period of the Mexican revolution is given some attention.\nThe Spanish conquest in the New World can be understood in much the same way as the ancient Greeks and Romans who conquered the barbarians of Europe.\nThe Spanish have learned much from their predecessors, particularly when it comes to defeating the native population.\nHowever, the conquest, when carried out by people of another culture, can result in many conflicts as to customs and terminology.\nThese conflicts were the focus of much of the early literature on the conquest - including the present novel.\nThe book provides an excellent review of the conflicts between the conquistadores and the native populations.\nThe author also discusses the religious differences arising.\nHowever, the Spanish Church was a unified institution of all the Spanish colonies, under the authority of the Spanish government.\nThe only difference at first is between the Catholic Church in Spain and the Lutheran religion in the Spanish colonies.\nLater, as the Spanish in Mexico were increasingly Lutheran in culture, the conflict was much more intense.\nThe government of Mexico was always under Spanish administration, but the Spanish were in competition with the French and English for the control of the commercial and scientific interests in Mexico.\nThe author explains how this competition was resolved in favour of the French and English.\nHe has also given an excellent treatment of the relationship between the Spaniards and their native populations.\nThe book concludes with a good analysis of the political situation in Spanish America in 1830.\nMuch of the present day Spanish-American conflict is the result of this conflict from 150 years ago.\nIt provides a good summary of the cultural conflicts arising between the Spanish and the indigenous populations and the policies of the Spanish and the French to resolve these conflicts.\nThe author has made excellent use of his excellent historical knowledge in the preparation of this book.","token_len":481,"entropy":[9.4847,1.7702,2.4095,0.3964,7.8292,0.9198,4.3598,0.3688,8.4317,0.1303,0.0029,0.7732,9.232,5.0134,2.3502,4.2325,9.6451,0.134,0.6546,1.6316,1.1173,0.9198,0.6232,6.7142,0.4541,7.064,4.5454,2.7726,7.3903,0.5217,2.6977,5.1427,5.4119,10.8943,1.4993,1.685,7.1284,2.8647,7.2303,0.6375,1.0482,4.213,0.9341,2.8223,8.3995,2.8978,5.2829,3.3664,2.0172,4.6844,4.3276,2.5634,1.9888,2.1633,3.6346,1.5407,1.3581,4.5065,2.0275,3.5126,1.1866,2.9039,4.9477,1.4642,3.1768,1.4018,0.6825,6.8677,0.1651,2.3357,4.8668,0.9271,3.7554,0.2266,1.1951,4.9173,3.0454,0.1534,0.6168,1.7762,4.6589,6.5012,5.931,2.6442,1.2059,0.3256,1.3574,5.0288,1.2658,1.6796,6.0356,3.7364,5.4424,2.5157,1.9872,2.4446,0.1598,0.7172,2.7025,0.1648,1.5187,2.1969,6.6977,0.0452,5.0958,0.8385,5.3106,0.5785,1.2899,4.1122,3.7158,1.4155,1.4288,1.7092,6.0808,0.6429,0.929,4.017,2.9101,2.4944,5.9331,6.7467,4.2955,1.7596,1.7622,1.2421,2.8769,2.7883,3.3043,1.6542,3.9309,0.0121,6.8973,0.3276,3.3606,1.9036,5.8113,0.1549,0.0131,0.2521,0.4234,0.6347,7.4173,4.9283,1.9807,0.4428,4.7974,2.9208,1.2602,7.1035,0.6869,1.2328,3.0212,0.7042,1.3582,1.0657,2.7855,5.6961,6.7496,3.6887,0.4262,2.0421,1.8415,1.7537,4.456,4.8172,0.9352,0.207,0.0009,7.7365,1.0219,4.5368,3.7822,0.9393,0.6312,4.8813,0.0885,1.3712,3.5576,4.9901,3.8415,2.7872,0.1236,1.9506,6.4769,1.6921,6.7224,2.6534,0.2838,3.213,5.8612,0.0268,3.2252,6.3448,4.5896,3.1383,8.5071,0.9086,6.8732,0.3786,0.5506,4.8745,0.8177,3.8286,3.9465,5.193,0.0524,3.5614,0.8367,0.1766,3.3846,4.6484,1.858,1.0563,3.3769,7.5804,4.1241,1.0299,6.7394,4.4577,0.4532,0.3055,1.2102,3.2466,4.5212,1.5558,1.0628,4.8592,0.1352,0.511,6.5676,1.8026,0.7999,4.3665,0.2793,0.0057,1.6675,0.602,0.5677,2.5777,2.1633,1.2539,0.3838,1.1651,2.0446,2.9328,2.9845,0.6675,7.4367,3.2848,6.838,6.4157,0.2605,4.8011,0.0519,1.2956,5.0283,7.9099,2.2598,2.961,7.5789,4.3094,3.339,5.1612,1.1986,4.2867,5.2691,1.674,6.1953,0.6064,2.7807,0.0415,0.8315,2.9441,3.7911,0.3309,0.3638,0.9003,6.2479,2.1358,6.5261,3.9042,2.259,4.594,0.4132,3.2965,0.967,2.5969,1.9217,0.1952,0.5046,5.5869,6.2762,1.0555,1.3823,4.9835,1.181,0.2451,0.2558,6.9929,1.442,3.6923,0.699,1.5026,7.39,4.3198,2.2067,5.0635,8.2685,4.0725,5.7568,0.4798,0.9686,5.5246,2.7472,4.0174,0.506,2.1998,0.6851,0.265,1.0071,7.3892,0.7382,2.5454,1.5569,5.5615,3.7202,3.0888,5.3444,1.0527,1.8218,1.636,2.4809,2.8629,4.1917,6.5664,0.2571,0.6699,4.5258,1.891,3.4007,1.1522,1.8723,3.2195,0.0912,0.7714,7.7441,2.1929,4.3826,4.7411,1.466,1.6468,0.2081,0.1762,0.9277,4.2955,3.2546,1.7493,2.1973,1.7119,2.2162,5.0793,1.9609,8.181,0.0029,0.3849,3.4705,1.0553,0.0311,0.9751,0.2314,3.1503,4.5627,1.4795,3.2809,1.3599,1.2129,5.8955,0.0679,0.3959,4.3692,0.1786,0.5846,4.9482,0.015,0.1057,2.8226,2.9322,1.9993,0.3767,0.1687,1.1006,2.0252,3.5495,0.5853,0.6615,4.2357,3.3755,0.0544,0.3799,3.8158,1.8772,0.7051,6.105,0.6242,3.3821,4.1049,0.6199,0.298,6.943,0.4031,0.3515,4.9361,7.2969,3.9822,2.9636,0.2738,1.6496,1.0005,3.3872,0.574,0.0083,3.8105,1.185,7.2558,10.4859,1.1063,0.7867,0.3215,0.3296,2.8341,6.8115,1.0078,1.8513,2.2985,0.0735,0.4636,5.973,4.3159,5.5269,1.417,0.3642,1.6466,0.5169,0.9598,2.4372,1.243,3.862,2.0366,7.1426,0.772,0.2924,1.0511,3.9769,1.5945,2.2792,3.1125,4.2446,1.6763,0.4251,0.2109,0.285,1.0193,0.7732,1.8325,4.4792,4.5458,0.3657,0.006,2.9328,5.6337,3.3406,2.8235,2.7221,1.9729,3.957,0.2227,1.3406,0.4277,0.2562]}

In July, the fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway that the latest type of fighter, the Douglas SBD Dauntless, was suitable for use in air defense of British ports.\nFurious was based at HMS Belfast (FF(C)9) from 1944 to 1946 as her new home and was assigned to the 4th AA Detachment.\n\n1950s period\n\nAfter World War II, Fury rose to rank of frigate in 1950 and was redesignated FV Fury (FV 45).\n\n1951\u201355, 1967\u201370\n\nIn 1951 Fury underwent construction on HMS Belfast as the ship was refitted over the summer of that year to have a radar homing system fitted. Fury was upgraded again in 1953 whilst based at Chatham, having been fitted with a radar search system to locate enemy attack aircraft off the coast of Norway that was the focus of the Norwegian Campaign.\nIn 1968 Fury sailed to Belfast for some refits and was again equipped with a radar homing system. Fury remained at Portsmouth on the Isle of Wight as HMS Belfast worked on the radar homing system being fitted to the ship, after which she moved to HMS Clyde (F34) in Gibraltar.\nAt that point Fury acquired the name of HMS Fury (FG(C)35).\nIn April, Fury was transferred to serve with the 6th Fleet and as such she was stationed out of Gibraltar as a base ship.\nIn October and November 1971 Fury was deployed to India to monitor the conflict between India and Bangladesh. The ship was tasked with the surveillance of enemy movements and communicating events to the Fleet.\nShe returned to Gibraltar in May 1972 and remained there until mid-1974 before heading to the United States for a refit at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 28 August 1974 for a tour in the South Pacific where she was based in the South West Pacific during early 1975, being deployed to the Australian and New Zealand forces. Following the tour Fury returned to Norfolk where she was declared decommissioned on 1 December 1978.\n\n1980s to present\n\nIn 1980 Fury was acquired by a private company and used as a base ship for a number of years before being scrapped at Chatham Naval Dockyard.","token_len":482,"entropy":[10.0392,10.9501,4.2211,9.5471,8.0881,9.6392,7.6645,7.0844,6.8391,5.6773,0.3175,1.214,8.5432,1.9506,4.8168,2.7637,2.9484,1.3174,2.4864,1.8979,0.0029,0.8904,0.1919,0.2511,2.9654,3.52,3.5899,3.3198,5.5534,9.5403,6.9691,1.3907,0.8195,0.0236,4.2196,5.467,2.5782,8.2559,6.9653,0.1307,4.4383,3.2655,0.4955,7.9878,6.0668,5.5951,6.9672,5.1518,0.0091,0.4894,0.9454,7.1587,0.2177,2.4385,1.2663,5.5491,2.7434,3.6038,5.2268,4.9942,0.5782,1.7824,8.5231,0.0247,1.4503,5.7757,0.6198,5.484,4.9561,3.9109,7.9908,8.162,4.0191,0.8578,6.796,1.5204,3.2058,4.8667,0.9249,1.8806,4.0862,4.1303,4.6528,2.9608,2.783,1.7076,3.3135,0.2807,0.5752,5.7014,0.2919,6.4554,6.9672,0.0168,2.1146,2.4186,9.655,7.9377,1.0997,9.1063,0.9043,0.0047,3.8393,3.9409,0.0026,0.3414,0.6434,5.8889,7.8983,0.4689,4.0666,2.1985,8.9161,0.0983,3.6244,8.3407,1.7053,1.5519,4.7405,0.0023,3.7348,4.2989,9.6765,2.8452,1.3497,0.9867,8.9357,2.448,2.0753,0.0024,2.2574,1.5376,3.2131,3.9229,4.5603,7.6661,1.0209,1.3768,1.0782,0.0002,2.1254,2.7169,1.8418,4.7707,6.3316,2.1348,3.6709,2.929,3.2318,1.9926,4.0809,1.2806,5.3339,0.0772,7.1582,0.606,2.6442,0.6372,3.0593,0.0095,2.3284,5.2497,1.5426,7.9388,8.6517,0.2571,1.7509,3.3935,1.4459,2.9225,0.9354,4.6776,5.6617,1.1005,3.5338,8.797,6.7028,0.3163,7.2787,0.7709,1.9708,7.1767,1.0329,3.2199,0.2601,1.0444,2.2364,5.8855,2.3756,3.3936,3.2106,2.4013,6.043,1.2344,6.5731,1.0252,0.6428,0.1467,3.1095,5.7645,1.8526,5.1713,4.4906,0.0297,1.1439,5.1687,6.6615,0.656,1.0518,15.5114,3.7377,0.7306,5.7595,1.4074,6.5306,1.8887,5.6498,5.8344,2.5481,1.4745,1.7646,4.5181,5.7305,0.1665,0.8209,0.3915,0.8668,0.0002,0.0457,1.1241,1.7939,4.4348,1.8048,6.0913,4.7427,1.3841,4.8226,0.0246,1.0431,0.0,3.7656,3.3215,2.2243,7.3096,1.8397,1.8933,6.5826,2.3652,0.0011,0.329,6.6631,2.0781,1.1913,0.9095,2.4896,4.632,4.5342,0.5978,1.5517,3.5566,0.3014,3.2235,5.3478,1.8931,2.1564,8.539,0.6038,1.6258,10.1303,0.7112,0.6063,14.4516,4.0342,2.0322,1.1397,8.6717,1.7706,3.8782,2.5355,2.1726,3.4406,2.3192,5.5247,1.9237,0.2474,0.07,4.37,1.6029,0.8529,13.1847,5.7963,3.1095,2.1597,1.1193,3.3848,0.1516,8.8629,2.3072,0.5409,3.9874,0.0457,3.8165,2.6806,4.4778,2.7917,2.7511,0.7623,5.879,5.9686,0.2601,3.366,2.9745,2.482,4.2693,5.0019,1.907,0.9851,10.2149,2.7787,3.6797,0.0724,5.0726,0.5374,0.8996,3.5915,0.4781,6.3755,2.787,5.2736,1.2454,6.8661,2.5827,1.101,0.0954,3.5624,0.8601,3.1806,3.6963,0.8767,5.2447,0.1914,3.6734,4.7612,0.4198,4.0341,3.525,1.7698,8.8179,8.5176,2.0305,0.9288,5.5268,1.1804,0.9456,9.1629,3.3819,0.1927,2.1407,0.9331,2.3059,1.1464,1.352,3.6202,0.8431,0.6626,4.5945,0.417,3.1098,5.6667,4.9325,0.6824,1.7551,3.8693,0.9765,1.6121,2.375,2.629,0.1057,3.0573,6.3214,4.5366,1.6861,0.1404,0.8569,2.9389,4.6436,2.6316,4.5035,1.6815,0.2539,1.9295,3.6463,2.4875,1.7887,3.5301,1.6325,5.7958,4.4286,1.3639,3.4902,0.6664,2.9059,0.2356,1.3587,4.0093,3.4949,1.7803,3.2485,4.8581,1.4069,4.718,5.8349,2.4044,3.6272,5.7837,3.8018,0.7218,1.5603,5.2622,2.7282,1.0982,0.01,4.4363,1.9154,5.0506,1.4733,3.0946,2.9149,2.0407,0.0755,2.6676,2.7207,0.2381,1.283,8.3021,5.3767,0.0,0.0013,1.5117,3.141,2.483,3.5778,0.4856,0.375,0.009,4.8065,0.2935,5.0586,1.3445,0.3563,0.0001,1.0442,2.9757,0.5933,0.9867,6.5588,0.3201,4.682,3.6993,1.2824,2.4511,5.0092,1.2815,0.7736,2.0062,1.3229,0.9753,2.6699,1.7599,0.0006,2.449,2.8829,0.8585,3.7912,2.5537,5.9213,0.0618,3.6661,5.7368,0.3691,1.364]}

While","text":"The centre of the two fleets was divided by two separate squadrons of the British line : the forward division under admirals Benjamin Caldwell and George Bowyer and the rear under Lord Howe. While the fleet attacked to the southward the army held the shore against the French attack, repulsing them with such skill and skill that at one time Howe was forced to retreat.\nBut soon both fleets were under fire of the Royal Navy, who had come out of the bay. The British ships attacked, firing with great fury at the two sides of the French fleet, and the Americans replied with the full force of their guns. The French lost nine ships, including three of the first three that attacked. They received a number of minor hits that made good use of their men but they were obliged to close range so as not to be cut down by the British shot. At this moment howe came out from his position and attacked, and the whole line of battle was brought up. The entire French fleet ran, and the American ships surrounded and boarded them one by one, capturing many men, even though these people were mostly seamen, and killing a number of them. Howe had captured five ships and a number of men. The British were then given the order to bring up their ships to attack and capture the remaining ships, which had already made the coast.\nThe French fleet was composed of six ships in the centre and four flanks. They were able to bring up their two ships that ran before, having received the order to do so, but the enemy's ships quickly surrounded them and brought them to a halt. The flanks ran to the rear for assistance, but without success, and the other ships were attacked by fire from the French line of attack and were soon captured. The fleet has been returned back to France in the custody of the British military commander and is now under the complete control of this military commander in North America.\nAs for the British fleet, it was able to capture three ships and kill a number of enemy men with great ease. The remaining enemy ships that were already under the British lines were captured soon after the first three ships, which were already captured.\nTherefore, the battle with the British fleet was successful but the Americans only defeated a few vessels and did not completely destroy an enemy fleet, although they forced it to take shelter from the attacks of the British navy.","token_len":483,"entropy":[9.153,1.6292,0.9523,6.4524,7.324,2.0456,6.1719,3.1525,3.1231,5.1692,9.1661,0.0028,1.5311,3.6926,5.1405,6.6578,9.2281,0.9278,7.6427,4.8638,5.4584,10.0914,2.9745,1.1611,8.1166,8.6173,0.4867,3.4418,7.1081,3.8523,1.6425,0.2812,1.4915,3.0605,6.3806,4.5281,0.822,6.1215,0.8557,4.0824,7.1076,5.7329,0.8195,1.6663,2.1633,3.7114,5.2792,5.4248,1.914,6.6007,4.2178,0.4363,4.1537,4.0267,1.5204,8.8706,0.4516,0.7579,2.3338,1.389,5.8341,4.7021,1.6003,2.9755,0.5362,4.0277,2.6701,0.9165,7.2151,2.0528,2.781,0.1909,1.6753,2.2848,2.1318,9.1486,5.4275,6.0988,2.2822,0.9158,3.9378,3.651,4.9674,1.1828,5.1043,0.9341,1.3735,2.51,2.0824,3.8968,3.3272,0.8858,1.0762,4.2368,3.2699,1.3284,2.6861,4.1635,4.6737,2.4724,5.5737,3.8331,2.4672,3.1693,1.9698,0.435,3.7215,3.9087,2.6745,0.1639,3.887,1.97,0.9238,1.364,2.1327,5.3297,7.9464,0.8208,3.2563,4.9025,0.8805,0.1522,0.6238,2.8575,0.7555,1.2822,2.7973,5.5058,5.7637,2.9057,1.0184,4.1859,2.5149,2.8759,0.9725,4.2715,2.3033,4.3393,2.7571,2.0093,3.8398,5.4127,3.0299,4.4892,0.0069,5.4484,3.9927,5.3608,3.2528,6.849,2.8626,0.0056,1.3484,5.8335,3.8811,2.8604,1.0397,5.4252,0.0634,5.7946,7.517,5.9172,1.2014,0.6908,0.0185,2.167,5.766,2.364,0.8681,0.5025,2.6724,8.1412,0.2828,3.748,2.0502,2.2335,9.4235,5.6839,4.9851,2.3293,2.5743,4.6626,2.5645,1.7451,3.824,3.3219,1.6357,2.189,3.8832,3.563,1.2891,2.4324,0.7466,4.8017,3.198,2.1711,1.5031,5.8224,3.9418,1.1212,6.0682,4.537,1.5465,1.6339,3.8024,3.6444,6.4136,2.9322,7.2734,2.2119,7.0049,0.5831,0.0013,1.4657,6.9088,4.0888,4.3088,1.68,6.4404,1.5238,4.8311,5.689,0.4728,5.7221,6.5445,0.0011,1.9459,0.8401,4.5333,2.3903,1.5053,0.2091,1.0441,0.5993,5.0323,3.3677,5.2036,4.3439,2.7417,1.8132,3.5945,1.8336,0.0263,2.0131,2.104,1.7633,2.7985,2.9104,3.4958,5.5577,2.0539,4.5931,0.1736,5.5051,2.7926,1.6345,2.416,3.1624,1.6707,3.1949,4.1355,0.8672,3.6898,3.2592,1.6014,2.7162,2.9957,2.7746,5.2593,3.2168,6.8822,3.2236,1.245,1.2777,2.981,1.8633,1.5137,6.6551,0.2835,3.4271,2.5163,4.4946,2.1644,3.1078,1.8865,1.9358,7.5981,2.3859,1.4201,2.2902,1.1482,5.1843,0.0455,4.7441,1.1742,1.8031,4.7133,2.7889,5.4696,5.5956,5.9417,4.8278,6.0938,4.656,1.9404,1.879,0.8076,3.6963,0.0803,1.8574,1.2256,2.25,3.5929,3.3153,2.2474,5.5743,5.057,0.8671,0.9069,4.1244,0.5904,2.0048,1.6577,1.1387,0.38,1.1375,4.9075,0.154,6.047,2.8241,0.773,2.2515,4.6084,5.4668,0.9745,0.9792,5.6306,2.506,1.7004,0.8607,1.1358,5.1983,2.4266,1.641,4.6752,1.1148,6.6686,0.8086,0.4985,2.6978,3.4454,3.936,0.834,3.3289,2.643,4.2069,3.4419,0.691,1.3533,4.7364,7.0437,1.3259,7.4923,5.7603,0.1409,4.4319,3.6594,1.7338,6.3212,0.0178,0.6258,1.6959,5.5646,5.1582,3.453,1.8841,1.3771,2.2645,0.9488,8.4911,0.2176,0.0172,5.8323,3.8791,2.1651,5.0829,5.6523,1.2334,0.332,0.4348,4.2859,3.0445,0.3096,2.8331,1.4148,0.3975,1.3509,1.0211,4.7708,0.0488,4.2951,3.0862,1.4585,1.6278,4.9057,1.531,0.2494,0.108,3.9914,1.6591,3.7214,2.7487,2.7598,0.546,1.2432,4.4818,4.017,1.023,4.7042,1.2263,6.0569,2.8642,1.8418,3.6379,2.722,1.0266,2.6597,7.0349,0.4052,2.1762,4.6429,6.0054,0.9893,3.2396,3.1845,1.0242,5.5385,3.3563,2.1551,1.5071,8.4828,0.9329,1.4846,3.4362,5.0337,0.2464,1.362,0.6515,1.0935,4.6117,5.438,1.4771,3.1514,5.6948,4.8316,3.3846,1.2434,5.4659,2.0938,3.8951,0.0837,4.8398,1.6804,6.5145,1.3167,0.8405,2.4955,3.2968,1.2285,6.4782,4.1103,0.6151,4.9897,5.0363,3.1092,0.4426,4.1362,0.3858,0.2416,1.4899,3.1243,0.3846]}

He received his formal education at St. Xavier's Institution before leaving for Singapore in 1974, to continue his pre @ -graduate studies in physics at the University of Singapore. Here, he received his M.Sc. degree in 1981. After obtaining his Ph.D. degree in 1986 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he worked for the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) for two years before joining the team at the MIT Quantum Electrodynamics Laboratory. In this, he continued to work in quantum information science and applied field theory. In 1991, and as an affiliate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) until his departure in 1997, he was actively engaged in research programmes such as the development of superconducting qubits and circuits and quantum information processing using trapped ions. In 1997, he moved to Caltech, to complete his appointment at the Laboratory for Quantum Information, at which he remained until June 2011. In 2011, he joined King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST) as a visiting scientist to join the team at KAUST Quantum Information Laboratory to complete the task at hand. From July 2011 to July 2019, he continued his appointment at this research group for another term of 7 years. He joined the Physics Department in 2020. He has authored and coauthored over 400 papers and has numerous conference presentations.\nProf. Khoo's research interests have focused around theoretical studies of solid and liquid quantum matter, where he has been particularly interested in phase transitions of quantum matter in the presence of magnetic fields. These include studies of superconductors and superfluids with quantum vortices. Under his direction, the group at MIT established a strong international collaboration in this field, which in turn led to the discovery of Majorana and chiral Superconductors. He was a recipient of a prestigious research grant from the US NSF, which permitted him to move freely as he was employed by a variety of institutions.\nProf. Khoo co-founded the Quantum Information Science and Engineering Society (QITS ) in 2012.

There is a tradition of Villa defeating other notable London clubs at Wembley,[70] notably West Ham and Tottenham, making it a favorite to end the current Premier League season as champions. Wembley is widely regarded as one of the great football halls.[73].\nIn the 1930s, a large number of players were recruited from countries such as Argentina, Brazil, France,[72] Germany, Italy[73] and Russia,[74] but also in many places in Western Europe such as the Netherlands and Belgium. In the 1950s and 1960s, due to the rise and the growth of European football, many players of great European talents came to England, particularly from countries such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy.[75] For that was a major part of the popularity of teams such as Preston North End and Nottingham Forest, that were able to recruit some European stars like Peter Beardsley and George Best.[75]\nIn the 1970s, the Premier League became established worldwide and began to attract stars from far around the world. There were many players of great European talent, including stars from France (Benzema, Matuidi ), Germany (Klose, G\u00f6tze, Ozil, Kovacic, M\u00fcller, Reus, Coman, St\u00f6ger, \u00d6zil, Gnabry), Argentina (Higua\u00edn, Ag\u00fcero), Spain (Torres ), Italy (Lecchi), Italy (Maccarone, Crespo), and Poland (Kujawski ). Many of these international players played in the Premier League, the most notable players being Robert Pires and Frank Lampard.[76]\nIn the 1980s, as the Premier League expanded in terms of clubs and players of different nationalities, it became the most important European league, attracting star players from all over the world. Many clubs in England also started recruiting players from the continent, but also from many other European nations, such as France, Germany, Brazil, and Greece. The French club Monaco hired stars such as Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, and \u00c9ric Cantona, as well as others.[77]","token_len":484,"entropy":[7.2906,11.2711,2.0696,4.8284,6.0571,3.8527,0.3901,0.9112,4.9259,6.1152,4.3332,2.5969,5.028,2.4598,1.6725,9.7218,1.6882,13.026,3.0157,1.2192,9.9018,0.0147,2.2237,6.1899,3.5531,5.4963,1.7493,8.2189,4.3787,0.0814,5.8787,7.7978,6.3435,8.2061,5.1146,6.3634,3.0702,5.7234,1.3343,1.0727,1.6406,2.9613,1.6186,3.1366,4.0581,0.9815,2.2511,1.707,5.4319,1.6072,1.8508,6.9406,0.6584,2.1139,7.8975,4.6941,8.211,8.7355,0.4417,3.3836,2.0214,12.2713,6.5255,0.1313,4.5861,4.9934,0.3911,2.3261,2.8892,1.7009,6.7529,1.7178,1.8685,6.2076,1.4557,5.3208,0.6159,4.8803,2.6586,0.0042,1.5668,4.0989,5.6186,0.6665,9.2713,1.4554,6.6466,0.7783,0.1378,1.2684,0.0285,0.215,4.6784,3.5975,5.905,6.1143,3.869,7.9948,0.6805,14.2966,1.7249,6.7378,0.1633,0.6796,3.876,4.2709,1.1252,0.0045,3.5999,1.9077,3.2855,1.1747,7.3361,2.0529,0.0044,4.1101,0.4318,1.9478,0.2163,2.8168,6.1474,4.1591,0.2102,2.0014,0.2365,1.2152,4.9814,2.751,0.4112,0.9855,3.7268,3.368,0.3732,0.1535,2.5649,4.4045,3.7124,4.7246,4.888,1.7514,4.0175,0.0317,1.8223,0.0048,2.4233,1.4849,1.5166,2.3941,1.2706,2.3198,1.6089,2.8709,0.0182,1.5846,0.1827,0.0002,0.5269,7.3639,0.0803,0.948,3.4434,4.3863,4.5836,4.4941,0.0605,3.7408,0.6597,0.628,2.2314,2.077,5.0081,5.4054,4.4435,5.7068,3.3639,0.4073,1.8518,1.8859,3.2751,1.6842,2.8598,0.4985,0.0038,2.2635,0.6159,1.0824,0.2263,3.0902,1.4391,0.7007,1.5086,0.2733,0.301,4.875,6.2152,9.2036,2.2597,2.6556,3.548,0.0269,0.3407,4.9089,0.2514,6.8204,1.0212,0.0024,6.4279,1.7317,0.0041,1.3516,4.071,0.0028,1.398,5.6632,3.1087,3.3885,0.0042,4.6275,4.1427,4.8979,3.1872,4.0116,5.2806,4.7366,0.0874,0.0038,1.1245,5.0626,3.4797,2.038,3.5122,0.1643,1.0147,5.9592,0.9352,1.5465,0.0073,0.5561,2.0743,3.0094,0.0078,3.1624,5.7945,6.687,2.0417,5.027,0.7276,2.1704,4.1207,1.1303,5.5129,5.0837,0.029,0.1693,1.0478,4.3465,0.7378,2.3576,2.9731,2.4318,1.0358,0.7711,0.6589,2.0219,1.6063,6.8265,2.0625,3.3143,4.6373,8.9925,1.6138,0.6488,7.0952,1.4981,0.006,10.4159,1.9782,0.1929,3.2909,3.7307,4.509,1.2402,7.2111,0.4789,0.0182,1.5985,7.3276,0.0172,1.3869,7.1206,0.4191,0.4885,1.3043,6.8267,0.0082,0.9771,5.9599,1.2565,1.3518,8.3992,2.3334,0.8748,5.7058,6.2425,4.409,0.6524,6.5265,0.0583,0.014,0.795,9.0526,0.121,0.0058,2.5553,4.3957,0.0753,6.8363,3.5217,0.043,0.3308,6.5909,0.586,0.0025,1.7162,2.5426,0.0278,6.4132,0.9103,7.4525,1.6835,0.0117,3.3903,5.9111,4.4759,1.1871,2.2636,0.0858,3.5738,4.3066,4.0433,2.9756,1.6878,4.2353,2.3192,0.5517,1.0084,3.3346,3.8516,0.0369,2.8211,6.5807,6.7894,0.0625,6.3053,4.0935,0.9681,0.5497,4.3307,1.5282,4.035,1.3762,1.0155,0.9068,0.0036,1.6632,5.0132,2.3241,0.9421,4.4968,0.7472,6.1854,2.8845,0.301,1.9631,4.2692,0.8929,0.0006,1.7283,0.3914,0.1403,0.6871,2.1504,0.9532,0.7977,0.0107,0.4012,4.8256,1.2632,1.6504,0.0025,2.6315,3.146,3.7289,0.0039,4.4194,1.5448,2.1349,5.3384,4.253,1.2532,0.0385,0.2795,2.293,0.6864,3.2052,2.9007,2.3129,3.1288,1.8876,3.0789,3.3131,5.3453,0.4004,0.9809,1.732,0.3937,0.1236,0.0787,1.2142,4.0133,2.994,2.5196,2.6739,4.1036,3.02,5.0431,1.6398,0.5578,2.4752,4.1492,1.1996,3.4075,3.8473,0.8789,5.0439,0.9531,2.3551,2.1602,1.6976,0.8325,0.0014,2.4872,0.4307,0.6636,0.1017,5.1569,0.1376,3.2753,6.1187,0.7817,2.4409,5.562,3.8181,6.1187,6.4143,5.9401,2.1849,0.0026,5.8,1.6558,0.0001,0.0004,0.0,0.0,0.788,5.3647,0.1006,0.0,0.0004,0.242,2.5802,5.3831,2.4027,8.8962,1.6472,1.6896,2.266,0.0235,0.0023,4.252,4.3244,0.1877,0.1632]}

In 1350 he was present at the naval victory at Winchelsea, where he allegedly saved the lives of the Black Prince and the future King Richard II. However, his father was killed in the battle and Lancaster was forced to abandon his naval career. Afterwards, Lancaster was able to move back in with his uncle the Duke of Suffolk, with whom he became close.\nLancaster was one of many loyal subjects of the deposed Edward III supporting Richard II during the 1350s, becoming a close adviser to his uncle, John of Gaunt, Duchess of Lancaster\u2019s lover and the future King Richard III. Despite his loyalties to Richard, Lancaster remained loyal to the Earl of Warwick. With the king deposed, Richard III forced Lancaster to renounce his royal title and, as punishment, sent him to prison. It took six years before his release, however, as he was able to secure the cooperation of Warwick\u2019s forces. Lancaster then traveled to northern France and signed a pact with the French monarch, Charles VII.\nAfter Edward IV ascended the throne after the 1377\u201379 Wars of the Roses, Lancaster was appointed Governor of the Duchy of Suffolk and served in that capacity until 1389. He later served during a war between England and the Kingdom of France, fighting to the south of the Thames.\nDuring the 1403\u201304 French invasion of England he played a key role in the defence of the English coastline along the Kent coast, defending both the northern approaches, especially at Dover, and the River Thames and its estuaries. During this he met Queen Margaret.\nLancaster supported the king in his wars of succession with Scotland and was made Governor of Ireland from 1403 to 1408. He commanded a large force that sailed south to the Isle of Wight during the Hundred Years\u2019 War against France. Thereafter, he sailed with the king to Flanders in 1410\u201304. He returned on 1417 to England in a critical period of military affairs, when he was tasked to lead a force under the command of Duke of Albemarle in support of Edward in the fight for York. Lancaster was killed, along with many of his men in battle, while defending the town of Paddington in London in March 1417.","token_len":485,"entropy":[8.7822,0.3817,8.8544,1.7717,8.7603,9.3442,1.41,10.0657,0.0002,7.3732,3.2137,7.4825,6.1267,1.9619,0.6615,1.505,2.9102,1.8217,2.4148,3.7003,3.6964,1.4923,2.0471,6.6853,0.5829,0.6948,7.5581,5.2318,1.6034,10.5439,0.8118,0.0524,1.1217,1.8021,0.8237,8.3333,6.0465,1.1416,1.2885,0.0013,2.7105,7.7845,4.0417,1.0381,1.9499,7.5604,1.5508,5.0745,1.8477,0.8181,4.519,0.1775,2.5941,6.1004,1.7372,1.8965,1.062,1.5675,0.8221,1.4709,2.9715,1.1374,2.8417,0.071,3.3392,0.9943,4.7683,1.2944,0.7427,7.1729,0.4948,1.2607,1.7933,4.7053,0.0064,5.2513,3.2981,4.3229,1.099,0.3005,5.0555,5.5529,1.5259,0.1123,4.3207,1.0813,4.6513,0.9395,0.0874,3.5373,1.7671,0.6848,0.9412,9.443,0.0296,0.001,1.7254,3.6684,0.0083,4.095,5.6418,5.7118,0.4808,0.8658,10.0542,0.0849,5.504,1.7368,12.3923,4.7068,1.1293,2.6188,0.4862,4.5829,1.1395,0.2811,1.9095,5.7382,1.4845,3.3362,3.9625,0.24,2.3306,2.4871,2.4242,4.5432,2.8805,4.0397,0.5658,1.3899,8.8503,0.0352,3.0586,13.9385,8.9886,6.003,6.8233,1.9166,3.7096,4.9389,0.8109,1.7516,1.3026,0.3228,4.6127,1.1702,7.2615,0.1466,0.0016,0.6353,1.399,0.9199,0.4156,3.1248,1.0559,0.1776,1.3358,4.6243,0.3979,3.0347,2.3364,5.5273,1.1812,4.9659,5.9491,0.0244,0.7365,3.341,3.7057,7.0569,0.5379,0.3346,5.1463,0.0005,0.2865,3.0024,1.7973,1.0409,4.9152,2.685,6.3829,0.2837,3.7718,0.6932,0.6576,2.7523,0.7752,4.8418,5.4921,4.4317,0.3284,1.5471,3.0391,2.1939,1.5553,3.4903,0.0894,3.3878,1.5696,1.0852,4.8623,0.0201,4.5774,2.22,6.8731,0.032,4.5932,6.7248,0.1073,0.0213,5.0077,1.4793,3.2117,3.8471,4.8225,0.3007,7.128,1.3176,1.9094,6.4671,0.9198,4.3406,0.1973,0.8664,1.022,5.0976,1.601,4.0258,3.1609,1.4647,2.0457,3.6638,3.5569,3.9338,7.0916,1.3404,0.0254,5.3317,1.3269,4.4164,8.2384,6.1843,3.3527,6.0849,0.62,0.8826,0.1916,0.2161,0.5661,1.7147,2.6566,4.9634,0.1618,1.8041,4.829,0.3247,0.0032,0.1098,4.3653,2.1263,3.3054,2.6527,1.7654,2.1172,0.4893,3.1572,2.8841,0.7375,1.3991,3.5093,2.2635,5.8341,4.0312,4.5843,2.0571,3.5441,0.0333,2.0545,5.6178,0.0304,1.4056,1.5027,4.931,3.2865,3.1975,6.2918,0.8042,0.822,4.9093,1.3308,1.9535,3.6866,0.9574,2.9575,6.0536,0.4052,4.2446,4.6759,3.1726,0.1147,2.279,4.7536,6.4453,0.354,1.6181,0.0935,0.1265,1.0107,5.8398,0.0305,0.87,2.2412,6.7858,5.4977,0.3226,6.4672,1.3188,1.2391,3.8998,5.2173,1.2361,6.2343,9.6556,4.5944,5.4958,3.3385,4.1092,1.2927,0.6329,0.9185,6.953,2.0834,3.2314,4.1881,4.8893,1.2239,0.0758,0.6782,2.7074,1.6375,6.9897,5.8437,4.4212,4.1344,3.3033,1.628,1.2982,0.0161,0.002,6.212,1.0052,3.9461,1.944,0.8317,4.9594,3.0697,6.5046,3.3406,8.121,0.9124,4.4338,7.0339,2.9142,0.192,5.3505,3.4299,0.9119,2.7517,1.2289,0.0755,3.4069,0.3696,1.187,6.2356,2.1015,2.6652,1.4837,3.736,5.9794,3.7228,1.8776,1.6065,3.4306,0.008,1.282,0.0,2.8883,0.3244,4.3619,0.0381,16.3712,0.2764,2.5028,3.8926,3.4265,0.8424,6.0168,4.5213,0.5449,0.7674,5.8182,3.9902,1.1929,4.0137,1.61,7.9942,0.1735,2.6066,1.0282,2.1309,4.5707,8.5395,1.5063,1.7321,3.9763,5.2178,2.5972,3.9855,0.8647,3.9461,2.8941,2.8495,9.5109,2.3574,0.9564,4.2215,3.9449,1.0952,2.1551,0.9858,1.6365,5.9082,2.4425,2.946,1.3921,3.2896,4.3452,1.3659,1.0351,0.0035,4.975,1.5235,4.5272,0.0475,0.0015,0.0001,2.9385,4.2771,0.0031,3.0532,5.6968,0.8963,5.0696,2.4731,6.9984,0.4445,3.067,1.3768,3.5116,4.1052,1.6405,0.0023,4.4418,0.8458,0.2307,2.8691,3.8364,3.1051,0.7171,3.7123,2.8309,0.8559,4.1509,0.3076,5.6631,3.9909,0.0302,2.0481,7.1126,1.6798,7.0693,0.2315,2.1383,0.2758]}

{"prompt":"A few days before Whiteside was old enough to sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United , he was offered a trial at Liverpool , causing United 's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to","text":"A few days before Whiteside was old enough to sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United, he was offered a trial at Liverpool, causing United's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to Spain to interview potential signings and Whiteside had been offered a trial with the club. However, the club rejected his services after they failed to sign George Best before him who was at the same age. Whiteside instead signed for Liverpool Youth Team and was part of a team that won the FA Youth Cup (in 1967) and the European Youth Championships (in 1969).\nIn June 1970, he signed for Tottenham, but the following September, he returned to Liverpool, where he would not spend a lot of time. He was part of a Liverpool team that won their last UEFA Cup final, beating Sporting Lisbon 0\u20131 in Amsterdam on 30 May 1974, and then part of a Liverpool team that beat Ajax 3\u20131 in Eindhoven in their first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1978.\nDuring Whiteside's time at Liverpool, he appeared in over 150 league games and scored ten goals.\n\nInternational career\n\nWhiteside was a member of England Schoolboys at Leigh, and also a member of the Liverpool U17 side and a member of the Northern Ireland schoolboys. He was also called up to play for the England U19 side, where he played two games against Holland. He was later called up by Gordon Banks, but was omitted from a pre\u2011World Cup training camp and did not appear in any official matches.\nIn the summer of 1974, he was called up by Ray Lewington as part of the England Squad for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In the first group stage match against Brazil, he played 90 minutes as Liverpool won 6\u20130 away from home.\nFollowing his playing career, he was a part of Liverpool U21 squad that won the European Youth Championship, although he only scored four goals in six games that year. He remained a part of the U21 side until his retirement from the game in 1992.\nHe had also appeared for Northern Ireland in youth international encounters with Germany in June 1973. At the 1974 World Cup, he appeared in all four group stage matches, all of which England won and in the quarter\u2011finals defeat of the Netherlands. His first international goal was against Hungary, scoring from one touch in the 28th minute to secure a 1\u20130 victory.","token_len":485,"entropy":[7.1838,2.4613,2.749,13.2102,0.1412,1.6009,10.9876,0.0719,0.0945,4.4031,12.9108,3.7371,7.8789,2.3293,5.281,0.2745,0.3244,1.5805,1.6477,3.8838,0.5831,6.8832,2.0138,4.002,2.1382,8.8224,6.0774,2.1444,4.8053,1.6746,5.7874,7.2447,0.2365,6.353,2.7688,0.4612,5.8223,0.7005,4.3002,6.5731,3.1674,3.8627,10.7642,0.0008,3.665,2.3001,2.4153,0.5719,4.8452,2.0077,1.7982,2.1983,0.647,4.4917,0.0855,1.9329,3.2912,3.4545,1.7664,7.4211,3.3929,3.8379,3.379,0.0274,1.8467,7.5462,1.287,5.322,5.5677,8.0804,1.641,5.0781,1.3392,3.2449,2.0881,3.8383,5.0079,0.0007,6.5358,1.9976,1.2282,2.8591,8.2813,4.7924,2.1436,2.2275,4.1004,0.0251,1.3839,2.8008,0.6008,1.0147,0.6256,2.5748,0.8918,0.1059,5.497,3.4216,6.1703,0.9395,0.7135,2.1575,3.5682,3.6295,4.3246,0.8847,0.382,2.4568,0.3406,1.0039,6.324,5.0117,3.161,0.477,1.9066,2.4231,0.5057,4.0578,2.7206,2.7192,2.7679,2.5765,5.4652,1.3211,0.6881,4.6618,0.0909,2.4257,1.844,2.4552,0.0725,5.011,5.327,5.3839,2.3027,4.4932,0.0097,0.0288,1.5019,1.6805,1.7262,3.3135,0.0029,1.023,3.5853,2.1147,0.1969,0.2288,4.4224,3.7522,5.5209,1.0348,3.0268,2.5941,2.5286,5.9586,0.4606,5.3442,6.1549,1.6339,0.9465,6.2794,2.2367,4.0988,1.7655,4.8086,1.8797,1.4763,2.5153,8.5164,0.0147,0.6567,2.7572,1.1865,0.0714,2.7954,3.9768,1.6368,0.0204,1.0032,0.5827,6.3866,0.2917,0.0,0.0001,1.8708,4.2145,3.1229,4.0097,0.1269,1.6568,0.2282,0.3443,2.0389,3.5217,0.2024,1.1858,3.9169,4.8236,0.0028,0.0038,0.9973,0.7123,0.7739,0.2531,0.6461,4.9818,0.4692,3.7405,4.0853,3.7809,0.6442,1.7306,1.7001,5.3349,0.0426,1.2772,2.3547,7.6135,8.6196,3.4914,0.779,0.0002,2.9253,0.0017,0.0023,1.6034,2.439,2.3095,0.0049,3.3033,11.6779,0.4434,4.4493,7.9368,3.8578,2.9636,4.1124,3.9902,0.897,0.0057,0.6763,3.8767,4.2758,2.5309,4.0664,4.1449,3.0161,0.9872,0.0037,0.4159,6.9358,1.0829,5.8026,0.1759,2.6874,0.8431,1.302,1.4472,5.8007,0.7894,0.53,2.3725,0.7884,1.4368,3.3959,1.3476,2.0559,1.8806,2.1011,2.2245,0.0793,2.0156,3.7802,1.5296,3.4406,4.1259,1.8241,1.4205,1.3013,4.5575,2.4554,0.0465,4.2248,9.3281,5.9182,1.9446,3.9272,1.5553,4.9715,0.391,5.042,4.3151,7.1952,2.8124,0.0164,4.0633,1.1499,3.5145,3.6409,0.0201,3.2807,0.5314,2.4824,4.7806,2.4462,1.0251,0.6993,17.0472,2.8891,1.7832,0.0554,2.7294,0.1978,0.8771,1.2001,2.6187,0.0492,1.9147,6.8095,7.7366,2.0117,3.7214,2.3305,0.0005,1.1226,1.9736,6.9516,1.3218,0.6263,2.6147,2.7325,0.3296,0.0446,1.3556,2.6545,1.6176,2.4926,4.5055,1.6765,1.3744,0.8567,3.5369,0.3086,0.6281,2.3078,6.5876,0.0273,4.2378,3.9484,2.3262,5.1155,0.083,1.2338,8.1145,0.8999,0.1147,0.7264,1.354,20.4306,1.6944,3.7404,1.08,0.5159,0.7649,1.4131,3.093,2.3378,0.0086,2.9566,2.4028,3.1569,2.4986,1.2599,0.6355,0.5614,3.5985,1.9174,2.4189,1.9077,6.1878,1.2615,3.8648,2.6523,2.9114,0.0876,1.2766,3.3792,0.8749,5.0636,1.3972,0.2536,1.4202,6.9359,2.2021,1.6197,0.0033,0.6519,1.8323,0.9558,2.7029,1.9075,2.2137,0.9814,1.9662,1.5364,2.0879,1.0502,4.582,0.7257,0.4592,17.9173,3.4526,2.763,3.2786,2.167,6.1682,0.0527,1.4419,6.4182,3.2014,8.8207,2.8376,5.5187,3.3392,5.3955,3.6581,1.9471,4.6446,0.9288,4.5613,0.7824,0.0881,0.7085,0.1966,4.3557,0.7575,4.5662,2.4293,4.7404,2.1008,0.6973,1.9184,5.7775,1.0745,0.1128,6.3332,0.6169,4.7535,4.6952,1.305,2.6782,3.9287,0.769,8.0553,2.3899,2.9726,0.8908,1.4412,4.2337,3.0453,2.7788,2.7712,0.9815,2.0855,4.9808,1.805,4.517,3.3055,6.3777,6.5536,2.9525,0.2985,5.7133,0.0244,0.0081,3.2539,3.6894,1.4128,2.0337,0.1071,0.3314,0.8375,0.7858]}

The first part of the game consists of Ardan investigating the shell , trying to regain","text":"Voyage begins as Ardan awakes in the shell and discovers his two dead companions : Barbicane and Nicholl. The first part of the game consists of Ardan investigating the shell, trying to regain consciousness and his memory. In the end, Ardan will decide to accept his death, to live with the shell or to take the risk to release it and bring back the other two comrades to safety.The game ends with Ardan entering the capsule in his mind and the other two heroes escaping to the outside world.\nThis game of the series is an early one, it was shown at Cannes in the same year that the others were shown, 1957. However, it contains elements that we find in the others.\nThe game ends with Ardan, in his mind, emerging from the capsule and running in the direction of the other two men in the game. This element will be used in several later games as a way for some characters to return to the world of Ardan.\nThe scene of the scene in the game where we find ourselves is of course the same ; Ardan is running in a clearing when he discovers that there is water outside. This is one of many similarities present in all of the games of this series. Most of the games end with Ardan running to find water from a spring and using water to stay alive ( in Spacewar, the water is used to revive Barbicane, and in The Day of the Dodo, Ardan is in a stream and his friends are outside ).\nThis element can also be seen in the same element in the film of the same name.\nIn this game, we also find another scene similar to the rest of the games.\nThis scene occurs at a cliff-face, where Ardan climbs up to release a rock which will have the effect of letting water fall, creating a spring, in order for Ardan to climb back down safely. This scene is identical to the scene in Spacewar where Ardan climbs to the side of the ship to release the rocks.\nThis scene also repeats several elements of other scenes such as the scene of the two friends discussing at a window of a building, the scene in Spacewar where Ardan sees the ship approach, and many other scenes in all of the games.\nThese scenes repeat many of the elements that we will see in all of the games.","token_len":485,"entropy":[8.6144,2.6756,8.4833,3.6165,8.3797,4.5493,7.2166,2.414,2.5292,1.334,9.1194,3.6781,4.3588,2.4442,6.431,5.2855,3.3037,8.4202,9.894,6.5683,7.1142,0.3611,11.4343,3.0501,0.9373,2.6796,4.5198,5.4596,0.4951,0.2963,2.3532,3.7219,0.0738,3.6168,0.0025,5.9405,1.1074,6.6099,2.2516,4.5898,0.035,6.7443,3.5814,1.6388,4.9697,5.2827,1.3323,3.5963,0.3784,4.1041,0.4337,1.459,0.0003,4.5532,4.7931,0.4768,5.2071,1.8235,3.8933,1.9824,4.3224,4.4072,2.6291,1.7947,5.9278,4.4444,2.2949,4.4455,2.1224,5.5462,3.5957,6.7985,1.7494,3.2191,4.921,2.051,1.0582,3.0861,1.7381,6.4572,3.5887,4.5474,0.1423,4.9711,2.0818,2.5963,0.8261,1.1183,0.0005,5.7693,0.7596,8.4628,3.1176,2.7028,4.5826,1.4615,3.1166,2.9564,0.3541,5.484,4.6644,2.6952,1.1502,4.2781,0.125,0.4505,2.2665,9.6743,2.1493,6.4648,3.9815,4.2345,1.1425,4.0897,4.6171,4.6767,1.4907,4.3496,1.1173,6.4038,2.1748,7.4178,1.7301,3.6027,4.6266,0.4305,1.6699,1.5464,8.1883,1.2366,1.8821,2.6437,13.5303,0.7583,4.0503,0.1332,1.7044,6.5574,3.7226,1.6913,4.255,3.797,0.4693,1.2519,4.6877,1.6056,2.2159,1.8891,1.7021,4.4143,0.3942,0.9294,0.0005,3.5478,4.6232,1.1328,1.784,0.4898,6.5898,0.2652,0.369,2.2618,1.1198,5.5345,4.0153,1.3553,1.6452,0.1831,0.9213,2.7877,0.6711,4.0147,3.8082,0.6792,2.4128,0.4278,3.3467,9.5002,4.786,1.7267,2.6869,1.3729,4.3934,3.3768,0.7209,2.9375,2.9857,2.2217,3.0636,6.3103,2.0065,0.1807,4.1931,0.5828,1.6343,2.687,1.3863,2.6027,0.0084,1.1198,0.8784,1.6096,6.501,2.421,1.0786,4.5072,2.5561,0.6195,1.6263,2.956,4.5193,2.9783,5.2243,2.7004,3.7915,3.7284,1.8804,3.4805,9.8916,2.6881,0.0019,1.7773,3.5494,1.4735,2.0964,8.2744,3.7986,1.4296,3.9549,1.6063,3.6295,0.7859,6.0423,5.1801,1.2787,2.6521,1.4746,4.0056,0.2403,2.8638,5.7128,8.1207,0.8613,5.3977,1.3819,0.3949,1.768,2.2049,1.4323,0.6274,0.6286,6.4967,0.8213,0.3843,3.4984,6.2669,0.38,1.0817,0.0005,1.8708,3.513,2.4664,1.5412,4.5974,2.0538,7.2301,2.2226,4.9401,3.0902,0.91,6.0166,0.8213,4.1842,7.2017,10.6062,2.1122,1.0195,2.7187,2.2165,1.7175,1.447,2.7814,0.6663,2.9754,5.6862,0.018,0.004,2.2123,2.3687,1.2445,3.1931,6.2455,1.2053,0.311,8.6724,0.4045,0.569,3.1302,0.0007,2.1509,3.3908,1.4206,7.6644,2.7011,4.9138,3.7055,1.451,6.5042,5.3039,1.0089,3.1429,4.8574,3.8553,1.0358,0.1103,1.695,0.2442,1.1819,5.4534,7.9289,0.9562,1.4778,5.025,2.8854,1.1694,0.366,0.4009,1.3264,1.0789,2.3166,2.6551,1.1847,0.6417,2.3494,3.5459,0.9845,4.753,4.2117,5.6255,0.0898,0.852,6.9787,0.2165,0.201,1.296,1.5825,1.8182,2.8637,1.6382,3.7631,2.8094,2.0486,6.0379,4.1522,4.7517,2.4976,1.7317,1.3918,0.0008,6.0564,1.8908,1.9531,9.5593,2.2514,3.1966,3.3721,3.6388,4.9182,2.4911,1.9361,0.036,4.9574,2.5001,3.0482,4.2421,5.3389,0.5069,5.5673,3.1744,3.7408,4.3412,3.1148,1.904,0.0011,0.0635,4.1757,2.6319,2.4663,6.8878,0.509,2.1915,2.8219,1.0835,6.1242,0.2456,0.535,1.4545,0.7216,2.6654,0.0011,0.0014,1.2449,1.3119,0.0005,3.7363,2.3893,1.1636,5.0105,0.4797,0.342,5.7264,2.8923,2.327,0.7978,3.6788,0.9785,0.8529,2.1515,0.7068,2.3188,5.7897,4.0237,4.1849,0.9912,4.3234,4.5913,4.9747,0.0053,0.9073,2.2366,2.2564,0.9846,3.2403,4.5624,6.5378,6.5523,1.7885,6.583,3.6756,1.4252,3.211,1.4855,2.353,0.9377,2.3951,2.5219,0.0002,0.0024,0.3004,1.0369,0.0005,4.7889,1.5063,3.7475,7.5407,1.6332,0.6477,6.5763,0.8295,0.8033,2.3623,4.8976,0.6657,0.3151,0.4345,0.9531,0.4851,4.0411,2.0495,4.9005,2.8093,1.9668,0.1895,1.3874,3.1419,1.4592,5.0277,1.3537,0.1639,2.9222,0.3173,0.2072,0.3243,1.9481]}

The entrance area and queue are modeled after the Fortress of Solitude, seen in the film.\nAt various points down the ride you will find small images of Superman, Clark Kent ( a.k.a Superman ), Lex Luthor, Brainiac and others.\nA very small section of the ride features a small scale Super Sentai unit. The figure is a Super Sentai version of Brainiac. The unit contains four figures.\nThe Super Sentai unit continues its theme with small displays of Superman, Brainiac, and three figures of other Super Sentai units.\nThe car park area had a few Superman and Superman logo references. See below. The ride was originally open from 2 January 2005 to 19 January and a re-tension of the Superman ride cable occurred.\nThe new attraction Superman: Son of Krypton was officially opened to the public on Friday 2 January 2005. To celebrate the opening, the park held a special event and a parade in front of the park and in which thousands of costumed superheros gathered on 31 December 2004. The park\u2019s Christmas parade ( known as Socky Parade ) has existed since 1989 and has become so popular that thousands of superheros come from all over the UK to participate each year. Superman: Son of Krypton is the third Superman ride in the UK. It is the only ride to date ( at least ) that has two stories both involving Superman.\nLike Superman: Unstoppable, Superman: Son of Krypton has a single story involving both Superman and Superman and there is a storyline both about Krypton and Earth. The first ride in the park that involved both Krypton and Earth was the Krypton Express. This ride was the first to officially be called a \u2018 ride \u2018 : ride number and all the park\u2019s rides have a number. This ride takes in the scenes from Krypton and Earth. While other rides are only named after their location, or were called by the locations around the park, the original Krypton ride and the original Superman: Unstoppable ride both had a name that refers to the locations where the stories take place. It seems as if all the park\u2019s rides have names that are derived from the locations of the original stories, or stories like them.","token_len":486,"entropy":[2.5476,7.7362,0.6652,0.5041,9.3009,0.6878,2.0793,11.6493,15.9492,11.9562,7.2609,9.3513,2.6276,8.9089,0.0022,4.7421,6.3266,7.5788,4.9032,0.4309,3.4077,0.9552,1.4902,7.627,6.4218,4.6293,10.8194,2.1925,7.5044,0.4403,0.8722,9.2989,0.2665,0.1877,0.061,1.8099,5.652,0.6597,0.7175,2.6108,1.0011,2.2454,7.6012,6.1971,0.3356,8.0309,0.2157,2.9278,4.8515,1.0682,1.9529,6.5365,8.2039,0.3204,1.6698,1.6984,5.8393,0.1255,5.3813,8.1058,1.6334,0.0002,0.0006,0.0005,3.9725,2.8217,4.0633,0.0031,1.8141,6.616,0.0022,1.516,4.0182,0.7222,1.5814,3.8628,5.1863,2.6028,3.3746,0.2082,0.1907,0.7198,3.0449,1.2763,2.9976,7.3811,5.7881,5.049,1.8227,7.6194,1.8596,1.8612,5.4516,1.4243,3.0847,4.6799,0.7523,0.003,4.9361,0.0709,7.9462,0.001,1.3537,2.0259,2.8956,4.8251,3.6167,4.7848,2.263,1.3097,1.5708,3.5652,0.1238,0.001,1.9646,8.0173,4.4864,3.1911,3.6206,6.6307,6.9807,0.503,2.0387,1.0505,4.2412,0.0005,0.6677,2.0203,7.1684,4.1132,1.9665,3.8758,2.4212,0.1885,0.0011,2.4932,0.4794,0.9486,1.3816,6.2761,3.2416,3.7098,6.5217,1.2293,3.5461,3.9578,2.5447,3.5869,6.9636,4.9419,0.9108,6.4966,2.5789,2.0651,3.1147,4.9873,1.8886,3.7204,6.2727,4.8204,4.1452,5.9974,4.1095,0.9117,4.3258,1.444,7.8297,5.3204,6.309,0.4259,7.0419,6.36,1.9471,0.279,6.9669,3.0945,14.1296,6.9415,2.8265,0.9103,1.4932,5.5172,6.2035,10.9526,4.2333,7.1343,0.0488,0.235,0.1655,1.6262,5.0831,1.4101,3.1473,0.3148,0.0238,0.7955,6.9589,4.103,0.8375,0.977,0.5621,5.7232,2.0216,0.6008,0.9119,1.042,1.054,3.2234,5.6045,0.6267,2.3388,2.4472,4.0969,2.4401,3.9446,2.9921,2.7585,0.0072,0.1714,2.2362,3.6923,3.6654,5.4143,4.5606,0.2254,10.8382,0.0386,5.5702,5.6913,0.0975,4.7074,3.6797,7.3245,2.1442,2.5469,0.8812,1.6812,3.4179,14.4082,7.6423,2.7106,7.0303,2.9777,4.8793,8.4498,0.2029,6.3204,7.4717,4.3108,1.9846,0.4017,4.7098,8.277,0.6123,4.8188,1.3949,1.9291,3.4835,5.9735,0.255,0.3878,5.9416,0.2146,3.6095,0.1163,0.0024,6.0366,3.459,0.9342,0.1004,0.1359,5.8095,1.2321,2.4834,6.6813,0.126,0.2827,6.1187,1.5355,0.069,0.0022,0.01,0.0005,1.525,1.9454,3.35,2.8564,2.5386,1.5355,0.5875,2.3575,1.5657,2.1543,1.411,1.7794,2.0119,1.349,1.9786,5.2363,5.4936,7.2392,0.8563,3.8072,1.8002,1.1977,4.5888,7.4627,8.1323,5.6515,1.4715,2.7314,1.3306,7.3687,3.1857,0.618,9.0351,4.5717,0.0217,0.9014,2.0997,0.279,0.1238,0.0019,0.0292,0.0005,2.1213,1.5251,5.284,1.0353,2.8787,4.432,1.0361,0.0863,3.7528,2.9989,5.3856,1.0199,1.1157,5.7233,6.6725,2.815,5.1619,0.1153,0.2859,4.6756,0.9252,1.5832,3.7428,5.1178,2.2128,0.2668,3.3898,5.7472,5.3811,1.8879,6.2304,0.2392,0.0775,0.1088,1.1456,1.5259,4.8489,0.3171,6.5465,2.4138,2.5865,0.4628,1.1337,2.9907,0.8471,1.9829,6.8947,2.3812,5.086,2.828,14.0615,6.1862,2.473,4.3362,0.0646,10.0813,4.6376,8.0949,3.1972,5.8872,2.1726,6.8743,6.9252,0.2664,0.0163,1.6436,2.8814,2.1735,4.1426,2.1445,2.9179,1.0173,6.0609,6.4571,1.5287,8.0483,0.7549,2.5133,0.0271,1.178,0.9567,1.5838,5.5234,5.1676,0.544,3.0042,4.1254,4.8176,0.7959,2.203,4.047,0.6245,6.5253,5.1097,4.6353,2.1253,1.4818,7.1321,6.913,1.2901,0.8198,0.4705,1.8864,4.4353,2.8934,0.0638,3.6246,4.4508,1.23,3.5126,1.1309,3.3253,3.2001,0.0017,0.0,1.3281,3.7745,3.2252,1.8222,2.0597,2.1481,4.9875,0.052,1.1941,4.1304,2.504,1.2778,4.0359,2.5395,0.0013,0.4135,3.9651,4.9679,4.0724,1.1649,3.7002,1.1039,2.2894,0.8148,0.0963,0.0019,0.2468,1.5782,2.3119,1.148,2.0158,3.365,0.0357,1.0468,1.1006,2.6992,0.8829,2.7985,2.9105,2.089,2.8564,5.2529,6.9501,4.9795,0.4572]}
{"prompt":"Religious worship among the Qedar , as was the case for most of the inhabitants of Arabia until the 7th century CE , was centered around a polytheistic system in which women rose to prominence","text":"Religious worship among the Qedar, as was the case for most of the inhabitants of Arabia until the 7th century CE, was centered around a polytheistic system in which women rose to prominence in the religious world. For the Qedar, in particular, female authority was at the heart of their religion. At a national level, they had both male and female leaders, although the women tended to be subordinate in their duties. Among the Qedar, they were responsible for education, maintaining the ceremonies, and maintaining the ceremonies. They also served as priests in their own right, providing spiritual advice and performing rituals.\nAs with ancient Near Eastern religions, the Qedar had a hierarchical structure in which lower-ranked followers were required to serve their higher ranking leaders. The Qedar followed a kind of strict hierarchical system in which the priests were the leading force in the system. According to the Qedar, they were the only true inheritors of the religion, while the rest of the followers were followers who had taken the religion for granted. The Qedar priests of the first century CE were highly esteemed as they served as the deified leaders of their religious kingdom and had the right to do whatever they wanted, without any restrictions.\nIn the second century CE, the Qedar became divided into several distinct kingdoms and civilizations, including the Qedar, the Nabataeans, and Zanj tribes. As the centuries passed, the society turned increasingly towards polytheism, and an organized religion that focused on the concept of human salvation. Through prayer and the use of incense, these priests hoped to gain divine protection and purification. This was particularly significant since according to the Qedar religion, evil spirits were believed to lurk in the earth and could be overcome using a ritual purification. Through this ritual, the power of the gods was allowed to protect the practitioners and their kingdom.\nFor centuries, the Qedar and other peoples in Arabia lived relatively free in their societies, and they had a large number of independent kings in the kingdom. In terms of political behavior, this meant in large part that they would only acknowledge the authority of the nation's most powerful king. To maintain this state of affairs, the Qedar were extremely careful not to support other kings, even if they were in the position to do so, and the kings in turn would try to avoid the danger of another king invading their country.","token_len":486,"entropy":[8.5305,6.6251,6.3157,1.6495,8.5389,8.9228,3.8515,3.4091,5.0309,1.595,0.6644,3.1317,3.6515,0.5044,0.4265,4.9922,0.2416,4.971,4.4355,0.5596,5.3158,0.0169,0.1779,3.5338,1.201,1.3286,7.1991,2.3409,2.197,6.4761,0.0531,0.092,4.1793,3.726,0.1237,4.0992,7.7015,1.5808,2.8425,1.7657,1.1329,3.8961,5.0603,1.3502,5.0304,1.9702,1.5502,0.1531,0.4858,5.4725,2.9332,0.0494,5.0898,4.4452,0.6364,4.7992,0.8894,1.6167,0.0037,1.3187,2.1818,0.9915,4.656,3.3201,7.8103,0.4623,0.1248,2.4997,3.3461,5.854,2.1789,0.1008,0.0011,1.8201,1.2706,5.1746,1.5207,4.111,4.2605,0.094,1.0684,4.8932,3.2383,2.7099,4.3787,0.857,5.0382,0.5009,0.6488,0.1338,0.5977,3.9241,1.4531,4.8051,0.0754,5.6432,0.5794,5.9202,1.7854,8.6259,1.4723,0.5169,3.3726,0.9077,6.095,2.0282,2.9844,1.4181,4.3091,0.2684,3.5131,2.926,2.6138,2.3985,1.4851,0.721,4.0521,3.0579,4.1538,0.9737,5.8058,3.2222,1.1169,1.4305,10.6021,3.0602,6.5102,6.2615,0.1914,1.7367,0.1348,0.8575,0.2096,0.0228,2.9086,1.2155,5.476,1.5188,2.6157,0.1394,9.1517,1.378,3.6194,5.4444,1.0997,4.3942,0.0474,2.8742,3.0358,2.2066,4.5415,3.2894,0.973,1.8486,0.876,0.0437,5.5771,1.6288,6.6854,0.0069,4.7353,3.5868,2.0128,2.3232,0.0315,1.8842,6.26,1.3783,2.9291,6.1132,6.6611,0.9528,0.8768,5.2429,1.0835,4.9575,0.0011,1.3961,0.4764,0.0182,0.343,3.3117,1.0678,2.5539,2.6613,3.7472,6.3727,0.0143,0.1261,0.5831,3.3882,1.561,4.4306,0.762,2.8572,0.3696,0.2752,2.5115,0.8578,5.9685,2.855,1.5103,4.5909,1.9354,2.6301,2.849,0.1528,0.5442,1.6811,0.4908,0.0107,6.4355,5.3468,1.0448,4.6161,1.4612,0.4141,0.8599,4.4545,4.2922,4.154,3.2545,4.1258,0.5255,1.4474,5.4144,5.9573,2.4203,0.3682,1.6614,2.9634,6.452,2.4747,3.6462,1.8265,3.043,0.0569,4.6295,1.6904,0.3398,1.167,3.061,4.304,1.9839,3.23,0.7992,1.4055,2.4188,1.1646,2.7186,0.3288,0.2194,0.105,0.8496,0.3341,0.0144,2.6501,6.7118,0.4194,3.513,2.8841,4.1986,2.7505,6.8998,1.4779,2.7349,0.6274,2.0829,2.0331,4.7239,1.1305,5.2259,0.6117,3.2799,0.0067,0.1319,1.0577,12.2803,1.2535,9.2146,0.6215,3.8507,1.3866,5.1448,1.0725,0.1701,0.7487,6.5223,6.4848,2.8551,2.9058,3.1339,0.0157,0.9199,0.9768,1.6183,6.0806,5.8583,1.8076,3.2113,3.543,0.3194,1.5888,5.8562,0.0303,5.8972,6.9913,2.1495,5.5404,7.1579,0.8977,2.8422,2.5789,0.0006,5.8476,0.2746,0.3437,4.3475,5.5251,7.8008,0.1241,4.4723,2.9878,2.6074,1.6809,7.4279,0.949,1.4616,3.661,1.8235,4.9168,5.851,3.6298,6.1084,0.0017,0.9019,0.4586,0.0119,4.5056,0.2507,7.5105,2.5206,1.3736,6.4497,0.0635,4.1089,0.0006,0.7508,0.5023,1.2324,0.7732,3.6423,2.0132,5.0109,4.39,3.0955,3.9659,6.5543,0.0602,1.8757,4.8044,2.2365,1.913,0.2073,0.7919,6.3255,0.2812,0.578,2.2406,0.9679,6.3184,0.0577,5.7802,0.6661,8.4817,2.1161,2.705,6.9189,0.7517,1.1218,4.5888,2.5151,0.4525,0.6125,0.184,0.0128,4.174,2.3828,5.2447,3.6481,1.5219,4.6752,6.2248,3.4888,4.1888,1.0055,2.424,1.3646,2.173,2.7528,2.7123,1.762,4.9359,0.9312,0.0035,4.7407,5.5092,3.9033,1.9838,3.0909,0.4023,2.5097,6.3704,0.0007,3.43,6.1145,0.1238,4.2449,2.9872,7.5429,3.9511,0.1241,0.1409,1.4368,4.8426,4.4503,6.1632,1.7817,1.9789,0.1068,2.0297,6.3389,1.9504,4.5797,0.568,2.5846,1.3744,4.9281,3.256,1.297,3.7219,0.1609,0.1188,0.0723,0.7993,0.3461,0.0236,3.3993,3.8811,3.2387,1.5687,0.0023,5.8672,4.471,2.9404,1.7419,3.1657,1.2194,0.6518,0.9926,3.1512,2.0596,3.0219,1.0789,0.6305,0.0061,2.9085,1.3652,3.3948,4.1527,4.0304,3.0898,1.9115,4.9974,0.1411,3.3292,2.7626,5.6863,0.2853,6.4975,0.7745,5.5728,0.9883,3.1943,0.3455]}

Having finished work on Infamous : Festival of Blood, they began to plan a new entry in the Assassins Creed series. Sucker Punch and Sony agreed to create a trilogy for the PlayStation 5. The first game was announced in October, and has been available for download on Steam since November 23rd. It was released on the PlayStation 5 on Monday 15th February 2021.\nYou should find it in the Steam Workshop, as well as the PlayStation 5 Store. The game will be released with a new update, and players will be able to play on the PS5 and PS4. If you don\u2019t have a PS4, you can play it on the PlayStation 5 with a backwards compatibility patch. Second Son for PS5 is the same game as Second Son For PC.\nWith this game the same crew from Infamous are back, and it will be the same for everyone who was playing the franchise before on the PlayStation 4.\nIn Second Son, we play as Calypso from Assassins Creed III. She\u2019s got one thing on her mind: vengeance! With only one weapon in her possession, she has to take on a bunch of Nazi terrorists, starting with a group that killed her best friend. Calypso is going to need your help again to take on her enemies, and there will be things that go bump in the night. Second Son is a hardcore action game on PS5. It has a really immersive story, which is set in 1936 and follows the same crew that took part in Assassins Creed III: Black Flag.\nAlong with them we will see the return of Jonathan Connor, a character from Brotherhood. You should play as the same character and play the story a few days later until a new chapter begins. It takes place after Assassins Creed IV, and it has a couple of twists and turns. The story will take place during the Second World War, and there will be a few characters playing the game.\nIt has a very strong narrative, something that will not be easy to do. If you want to see everything that you have to do, you should play the game. It doesn\u2019t take long to explore, nor does it take long to do everything. You will spend a good amount of time working in the field, and getting ready to do your dirty work.","token_len":487,"entropy":[10.7847,0.2688,9.1678,7.4847,2.473,2.3186,10.6793,2.872,6.4361,3.2436,8.0191,2.5385,0.6375,0.5943,2.7196,5.5231,0.5492,6.2301,5.5233,4.0234,0.0868,8.7552,0.2066,7.658,10.5508,0.4948,1.783,0.7468,3.9471,2.5953,0.8969,3.4282,2.0401,2.6566,5.6072,1.3579,0.4272,12.0967,0.837,0.4441,0.775,5.5382,0.023,0.006,5.0131,4.2854,5.9071,0.5159,2.5834,0.8147,5.5472,3.3879,0.7257,1.2781,5.8044,1.6958,1.9829,1.976,2.7511,1.3546,4.4752,1.2236,3.0921,3.042,2.0629,5.5682,1.6287,4.9044,1.238,2.7284,2.1701,3.0548,1.3302,2.8878,5.1728,1.0091,0.5839,3.1383,1.7101,2.0909,0.7867,2.4814,0.6381,4.9486,0.8645,7.1047,5.6501,0.4363,3.5139,10.682,0.6743,0.9211,10.0593,5.8445,5.3332,2.7452,2.9562,0.9401,3.5673,3.1607,2.2915,2.7755,1.3577,0.0602,1.2362,2.4268,7.1219,2.1773,0.69,2.6649,1.2663,2.0422,0.874,2.0372,4.2703,1.6368,2.6189,5.1618,2.4074,2.4403,5.8869,0.829,0.9257,0.0824,0.0066,2.0889,4.0745,1.1408,1.6048,2.6958,3.3035,1.2334,0.3417,1.7135,4.5709,0.1949,3.1303,16.4661,6.9866,0.9767,2.1009,1.4238,1.0163,0.363,0.9152,1.1781,0.9064,2.9927,1.8802,0.7192,0.6563,1.392,1.9042,3.464,1.5997,7.131,0.9743,1.6837,0.7991,5.4608,0.0155,6.4047,2.3312,2.1441,1.7844,3.9039,3.5884,2.4591,0.8559,4.9734,0.0905,6.0691,3.0111,1.3163,0.9838,5.5283,2.743,2.9825,5.245,5.5161,8.654,3.5092,3.1458,0.0018,4.2485,2.8395,1.4433,1.3149,2.8487,2.0603,0.3904,2.7108,1.048,3.5675,2.3939,3.7513,4.8422,3.9478,1.4985,6.0501,3.1875,6.9357,0.7193,1.0101,0.7036,0.2845,1.5696,3.7176,3.6377,0.005,1.5629,3.7936,5.4462,1.094,7.3792,3.1405,0.0001,4.2015,4.9207,0.0107,2.0009,1.2174,5.1607,11.5905,0.5142,0.1783,5.9437,5.4525,4.0114,3.1988,0.1079,0.4512,1.8413,5.9637,3.4357,4.7499,5.0074,1.5592,3.72,1.9404,0.5842,3.8609,0.2854,1.0272,2.6161,1.1655,3.1688,2.286,2.0081,5.8943,0.0255,8.4931,4.3098,2.5121,5.7573,0.7906,2.1836,3.0542,2.9287,5.717,3.1632,4.4999,0.0389,1.7374,3.2627,0.0075,0.0041,1.5858,4.6506,0.1841,2.4656,3.721,0.0715,7.5922,3.3722,3.3693,1.6272,4.0733,2.4863,1.282,0.926,4.346,2.0751,0.0998,5.8804,1.744,5.2297,3.5733,0.0249,0.0266,0.0179,1.5802,6.1619,0.0049,1.4509,1.7732,7.2997,1.5924,0.9529,5.4544,1.6515,2.3543,1.5285,1.8213,2.04,1.3612,5.9503,7.4639,2.0291,1.3166,3.2989,1.3147,7.8796,0.3208,7.8638,2.547,4.0185,1.2985,4.1318,5.17,2.6146,3.7802,3.3758,0.0113,7.7425,0.0079,0.5515,2.8401,2.273,0.0368,0.4359,1.4781,6.7649,0.6044,7.3952,3.9129,1.9089,2.6538,2.1627,2.3413,0.0102,8.9503,7.2178,1.049,1.5504,3.2109,1.3782,8.0389,2.4583,4.7168,4.3535,3.6877,1.9171,2.537,4.6038,1.1907,4.6061,4.4897,2.3918,4.7006,5.8282,3.7696,4.6553,1.2109,6.3804,4.9327,1.0395,5.3832,2.5722,0.3555,3.3819,4.9852,0.1993,2.1351,4.8435,0.0022,1.8459,1.7289,1.1166,2.4356,2.429,1.4475,4.646,0.389,3.393,2.2384,0.3592,0.75,2.2335,2.2832,2.2486,1.9779,0.1379,3.2545,0.6748,4.83,3.9624,0.0011,0.6323,1.0519,2.9584,0.8269,0.0899,1.4834,3.5211,4.3126,6.6593,2.0352,2.9223,1.8224,1.5382,3.826,2.8149,1.5334,2.6807,4.077,3.8835,1.0841,6.587,0.5911,2.6718,4.4797,0.5951,3.4874,0.4905,3.4174,2.4801,4.2111,0.1723,2.2191,0.2567,3.0335,5.5095,1.7132,3.8166,2.8736,1.9582,1.2919,1.418,1.3613,1.9498,1.8253,1.6143,0.4908,1.4176,2.1378,4.4983,1.147,0.4766,0.0092,1.249,1.0544,0.9538,5.9523,2.1311,6.7309,1.104,0.0446,1.0705,1.0869,0.2074,4.2646,3.9563,1.8741,2.7461,1.1121,5.2401,1.3965,3.4512,0.8019,0.0032,0.0443,4.8172,3.864,1.0164,5.536,0.8173,1.1914,4.7458,3.3113,1.1215,2.9537,2.4725,5.6825,0.0465,0.4515]}

His first move was to Heybridge Swifts before joining Oldham Athletic in 1985. In 1987, he had a breakout season, scoring 35 goals in the league. After his contract expired, Cooke moved on to Derby County, before signing for Doncaster Rovers in 1989. After two years with Rovers, he moved to Manchester United, signing for \u00a3 2.7million in 1992. He spent ten years with # United before his move to Newcastle United in 2004. He made a successful initial debut appearance for the Magpies in the second match of the 2004 - 05 season, scoring a free kick from just outside the box. He had a good season when he scored twice before suffering a knee injury. The injury meant he was unable to make much in the league, but when he became fit, he started to impress, with his performance being considered an outstanding performance for a young player. Colchester United made his debut for the club in a friendly match against FC Dallas on 4 August 1990 and scored in a 4 - 1 victory. After a year at Colchester, he moved to Oldham Athletic for \u00a3500,000. He moved to Leeds United in 2002 for \u00a3750,000, scoring his first goal for the club in a 1 - 3 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 2 January 2003. He joined Middlesbrough in 2005 for \u00a3800,000 and scored 21 goals in 38 seasons of league football. In June 2006, he joined Crystal Palace on a one-month loan, scoring two league goals. He scored one goal in his debut match against West Bromwich Albion. Crystal Palace signed C Cooksey on a \u00a39 million contract, which began in January 2007. In a pre-season friendly match against Dundee United on 20 July 2007, C Colchester had his shoulder ligament damaged in an injury suffered when he collided with goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey during the match. The injury meant that he could only train on his own with the use of a sling. On 4 August, he made his return for the club after playing the previous week as a substitute during their 3 - 1 defeat to Newcastle United. He also scored one goal in the match.

While","text":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9, and spawned Tropical Storm Fran four days later, before it moved through the southern Windward Islands on August 14. While Francis would not do nearly as much killing as Irma, it would spawn tornadoes in the central and northern Bahamas and knock out power in the southeastern United States. By mid-August, Francis was moving slowly over the southeastern United States, and began to weaken as waters warmed. It brought heavy rainfall in coastal Florida, but no widespread flooding.\nThe hurricane season is quite active for the time of the year. Most of the hurricanes tend to be located near the coasts of Africa and the western North Atlantic, though some of the better-studied ones, such as Florence and Fran, come from land and move west and south. Most hurricanes in August are weak and disastrous, although the Atlantic\u2019s strongest hurricanes tend to occur closer to the end of the month.\nWhat is a tropical depression? A severe tropical weather system that does not develop into a tropical cyclone or hurricane and is generally weaker than tropical cyclones and hurricanes are sometimes called low- or minor-scale tropical weather systems. A synoptic system that does not include the eye or eyewall of a tropical cyclone or hurricane is sometimes called a severe tropical weather systems.\nThis is a major tropical storms that are typically associated with weather systems from the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Typhoons that strike the East Sea region are usually in or near the same tropical system as a major hurricanes.\nWhat is the significance of the season? August 1, The tropical circulation in August is dominated by a major upper-level ridge, as seen from satellite imagery above, with the area between 15 and 30\u00b0N and 50 and 75\u00b0W generally wet, except in the North Pacific where the convection is weaker. August 1, During the second week of August, the upper-tropospheric jet stream becomes more pronounced between the tropics and northern latitudes, with a ridge system in the western North Atlantic that is stronger than July but less pronounced than a week ago.\nAugust 1, In contrast, a mid-tropospheric ridge begins to build up near Iceland, with the area directly to its east wet. This ridge system then strengthens and extends northward over the eastern North Atlantic. This may cause a weakening of the convection in this area.","token_len":487,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.6992,5.0789,0.5811,0.8483,0.1744,5.1382,2.294,4.4645,3.2053,0.7109,3.7305,7.4045,6.4528,0.3851,7.9441,9.6412,0.1699,0.0498,1.9453,4.6495,2.194,3.7671,4.7655,0.4726,3.9893,10.6626,1.765,1.5817,1.5803,1.0288,2.6769,0.4746,5.2063,9.9388,5.3245,2.1915,5.9733,6.6123,0.3005,1.4757,8.1701,0.4286,4.6776,0.6183,0.9364,1.689,8.2104,7.8878,0.1593,2.8003,0.9843,4.4088,1.3027,3.1948,3.7071,1.6728,7.7463,0.7784,0.6769,1.5481,1.4421,4.1969,1.5435,0.0118,0.5548,5.5012,2.9364,0.1307,1.0851,0.2465,2.2676,1.4193,3.791,4.1745,4.3127,0.5885,5.1727,1.2404,0.0031,0.773,1.9026,6.3048,1.0367,4.1284,2.4369,8.1688,5.1084,1.3744,3.2605,7.1908,3.8402,1.8326,2.504,5.5584,2.8863,0.8,1.9084,3.5884,4.5378,1.496,0.7227,0.8867,9.4255,2.866,3.6527,1.7418,5.3739,3.6949,3.7933,1.7881,6.3101,2.4904,4.13,0.2431,1.2291,4.9029,0.8329,0.2006,4.665,6.3662,0.0173,1.9277,4.8473,2.7997,0.9177,2.9039,1.3671,5.0318,0.8091,0.6963,5.3553,5.5246,1.3153,0.8401,4.1468,1.7307,2.0618,0.741,7.7847,0.6368,7.0875,0.0029,1.6488,2.73,0.7806,0.0016,7.5281,0.8335,8.453,0.142,5.1947,0.6899,7.1357,2.8603,6.5522,4.1587,3.3218,1.3192,0.9483,4.0886,3.7348,3.8104,4.4788,1.1009,5.725,1.7782,11.1371,0.8078,4.6646,2.4043,4.0396,15.6543,7.8237,4.4809,1.6821,2.6511,4.1159,0.0181,4.9556,5.2675,0.0402,0.4947,5.5826,0.0208,0.755,1.5471,0.7376,1.2794,4.4816,2.0183,3.1704,2.0062,6.4329,0.1667,1.6659,5.0991,1.9469,7.185,1.3283,3.4407,5.0854,0.1283,3.5117,3.1415,0.4764,1.1375,1.8895,0.0083,2.6624,2.3316,4.8763,1.7746,4.151,5.5053,0.3168,4.128,0.825,0.2489,2.7019,0.894,4.7176,4.8836,0.4162,8.6225,0.7867,4.5439,9.599,0.1825,4.742,1.7699,5.4442,0.229,0.4377,1.9869,10.9385,2.149,0.0261,1.2775,1.9601,2.748,0.3532,6.2988,2.9091,9.0983,1.7773,7.9741,3.3128,2.626,1.3814,0.4615,0.9559,0.7854,0.0149,1.0448,0.2287,2.4183,4.1352,0.0671,0.4676,4.8012,0.9891,3.8924,6.6894,1.9161,1.5595,4.6086,2.2666,1.2217,4.9252,3.9814,6.7658,3.0046,2.6854,4.616,3.5176,0.0203,6.8251,2.7797,4.4369,1.124,3.5649,0.3688,2.0723,1.2327,3.3609,0.2813,0.009,0.7552,9.6602,0.0044,3.3223,3.5405,0.9536,3.9862,5.8215,5.547,2.2287,2.4591,5.4656,7.437,0.2994,0.5568,5.6018,5.0762,2.5679,0.5794,2.6424,3.3546,3.8225,1.1359,1.4892,2.837,0.6774,2.113,5.9073,0.0258,2.1912,5.4343,0.7435,5.8744,5.7701,3.1788,6.3229,4.9825,9.168,2.4734,6.0772,0.5793,4.0754,0.0257,2.2046,5.0128,8.0307,1.1482,1.2063,5.1302,2.1523,4.9012,2.1335,1.4221,7.3986,0.9848,5.8818,3.7567,3.3925,1.8078,6.0909,3.0642,5.7205,0.8117,2.218,2.4241,1.1364,3.2571,4.5104,5.9954,4.5413,0.1282,1.179,8.574,7.2541,2.9481,5.8991,1.0524,0.7979,3.8366,2.8964,2.8436,1.2316,6.3556,0.8524,1.7962,4.2528,0.5716,5.0251,1.9807,1.4182,6.1742,0.5297,4.5653,1.847,0.0908,0.6949,0.4413,0.9683,2.1114,0.5806,6.8921,2.8187,0.001,6.2307,0.05,5.6201,1.8926,4.3878,6.7552,0.9202,4.5775,0.1048,0.6413,5.5528,1.6328,0.0008,0.7869,2.1181,2.1077,5.2883,5.5441,3.185,0.2964,3.6967,3.1159,0.5499,2.6478,1.771,4.6658,0.7482,9.6287,6.1371,2.3473,3.3924,0.9962,4.2812,8.9713,0.6102,0.245,1.5834,3.1208,1.1363,0.5079,3.7835,3.863,1.0046,3.3697,5.3511,0.0795,0.6184,0.0822,0.0012,2.2972,7.9382,0.5777,4.4448,1.2049,3.8677,7.7429,1.4975,2.7222,1.8767,2.3721,9.325,3.0535,4.0317,2.212,7.9393,2.1741,2.1815,2.2845,0.6533,5.3666,4.7887,1.753,4.9253,2.6417,0.4346,3.2707,0.7443,3.0351,2.5548,0.3166,1.9613,2.6949,5.5154,3.3848,1.6168,3.0935,0.2512,0.2451,3.5973,0.4348,1.9764,4.4604,1.6913,1.5686]}

{"prompt":"The episode was broadcast online by Netflix on February 1 , 2013 as part of the simultaneous release of all 13 episodes of season 1 of the series . The debut date was a weekend","text":"The episode was broadcast online by Netflix on February 1, 2013 as part of the simultaneous release of all 13 episodes of season 1 of the series. The debut date was a weekend later to avoid conflict with the American broadcast schedule of the season premiere.\nAccording to the synopsis announced by the network and show-runner, this episode would be the start of a new arc. This season of The 100 will cover the final three months of the trilogy (Earth Day, July 28), from the end of season 1 to the end of the story of Season 2. This also marks the series introduction back to Clarke\u2019s world, starting by a flashback of her being pregnant and partway through the second season.\nFor all these reasons, the first season of The 100 will now be over in four months. The first four episodes of season 2 are the most requested, and it is only expected to broadcast in 2018.\nBy this time, we will see how Clarke will continue to struggle between her fear that some of her friends are dead, and her wish to find out what happened to the others. She will begin a new journey against the clock, because the end isn\u2019t so predictable in this series.\nThe 100 Season 4 will be broadcast on Netflix on the following dates. All episodes will begin to be released on Netflix on the same day of the week of the premiere of each season: Tuesday (January 15) until Thursday (March 3) In April, Netflix will transmit the fifth season on Wednesday until Friday (April 15 \u2013 21)\nIn all episodes, Clarke and her friends will return, but they will face new threats and discover unknown mysteries, and we can expect to see different enemies. We will also learn that it\u2019s not only the mysterious people who are killing people, because it seems that other civilizations are attacking.\nThe other main question is where Clarke returns to and how long she would be there. However, even though it is certain that the series will come to an end in 2019, the final season has not been decided yet. At any time, we could see the return of the friends of the 100, as happened in the premiere of the fifth season, and they will all be ready to continue the story of the season.\nFleece for babies!

Tessa is often seen making art works on her mobile phone.\nIn her current show at Artspace the artist's work is an investigation of nature, using plastic and metal as her materials of choice. The artist's interest in nature has been a source of inspiration for Tessa for many years - especially trees and plants. She uses a combination of materials, from plastic to metal, to create her work which is then painted and glazed in pastel and black. One of the main elements of the show is a metallic sculpture - a figure of a man which is part of her series, the'men in love'.\nThe Artspace show runs until 22 July. Tessa says she hopes her creative process leads to the creation of a new body of work - this series is the result of exploration and the search for a new expression.\nThe Arts Centre Artworks Gallery is located on the ground floor of Arts Centre and can be accessed via The Caring Shelter entrance.

With the increased health risks our environment poses, it makes it even more important for businesses to do all they can to stay germ-free. It\u2019s an especially difficult challenge to keep offices clean and free from germs in a place where it\u2019s frequented by multiple people almost every day: employees.\nMany companies, from office buildings to hospitals to fitness centers, are in danger of having employees catch and spread disease if they don\u2019t keep their work areas clean. Cleaning companies can keep your office spotless and germ-free, but they do so with products and services that are toxic and harmful to your business.\nOne of the worst things you can do for your business is clean your facility with products and chemicals that are toxic and harmful to your employees. These can include:\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has identified several serious health risks caused by common cleaning products.

Carter. In November 1862, Pitman was captured near Warrenton Junction on the march toward Fredericksburg, Virginia. When he died later that month, Carter wrote, \"The medical board could not decide on the subject of his wounds between wounds of the head and the throat... The body was carried off to Alexandria and buried in one of the fields there near an open grave... His remains... were taken for examination and the autopsy was made, and the conclusions were reported.\"\nCarter also recounted that in July 1863, as the troops were preparing to leave for Washington, \"A very high official\" came to the rear regiment and reported to \"Col. Pitman, a surgeon, and a major surgeon with the regiment, that there was an excellent chance that the corps might obtain a grant of gold and silver, but it would want to have a few more thousand bodies to take with them.\" The official offered to have a thousand bodies returned to the regiment when it reached Washington. At that point, the official's name was not mentioned, but a subsequent report written by a sergeant states that the commander of the 3rd Corps asked the sergeant for permission to return part of his platoon's bodies to the corps. According to an oral history written by a military historian, the official asked the sergeant to do what he could to persuade Captain Pitman that he needed his corps. There appears to be no record of the body of Pitman being transferred to Washington for burial, and the Army's official medical reports say that he died of \"hypodermic death.\"\nRobert A. Lerner, a historian who focuses on the Confederate Army and who lives near Fort Pickett, wrote in 1996 that when he was eight, he saw what he thought was the remains of a Confederate soldier buried behind a barbed-wire fence at Fort Pickett. During the restoration of the fort in 1999 and 2000, as part of the National Park Service relic hunting program, it was discovered that the remains belonged to a private of the 37th Regiment of New York  and were interred by civilians.  \"They dug it up and they put it in a little white bag.\"\nA 2006 oral history book written by former Army sergeant Gary McCoskey, who served among the soldiers of the 37th New York Regiment, claims that pitmans were the corps medical corps.","token_len":490,"entropy":[5.8798,6.8594,4.0152,0.4588,11.2335,3.4766,0.1006,6.5898,6.6329,3.791,1.3449,5.6414,7.8951,0.8511,4.4785,4.5924,0.8967,6.4239,2.7904,1.6709,5.8349,4.0941,0.1651,4.3366,0.0011,1.1592,3.3451,3.892,7.7601,1.9339,0.0124,6.7234,3.9659,0.7299,9.195,3.9505,6.8896,0.0319,0.002,1.0698,1.3331,0.7861,3.8882,0.6912,5.4368,6.4557,0.4732,1.1597,0.1903,3.2092,2.3491,1.5702,0.3539,2.5758,8.2246,7.0389,5.1688,0.2806,4.9387,2.7656,1.5018,5.1887,1.2658,1.7618,7.6186,8.3754,6.3001,2.195,1.4151,2.4574,0.5557,1.5841,3.699,4.9522,2.7648,5.0431,0.8443,4.2358,3.6931,1.148,6.708,2.3562,2.2874,1.2434,6.0718,0.0852,0.3298,6.1299,5.855,5.357,6.2745,3.467,2.4107,4.1622,3.9342,3.1631,7.6435,1.3507,3.245,3.7014,1.4701,1.7314,2.8235,2.7843,1.6082,3.6675,4.009,1.1063,1.5659,5.267,1.605,4.8339,2.3425,1.0162,17.5424,3.0533,4.955,1.9119,2.6084,3.6332,1.3612,0.3411,4.1168,1.779,4.4411,1.003,2.463,0.4238,1.6789,1.5389,3.5213,0.2322,3.0107,3.7063,4.3756,5.4053,4.2577,7.2822,3.5855,0.7322,1.648,5.3946,9.8592,1.1496,5.1906,1.8569,4.9808,5.2956,1.2104,1.6054,0.0029,2.1697,3.9503,4.0971,1.2363,3.1499,2.4353,5.9641,3.7336,4.2635,1.1026,3.4175,0.9015,1.0637,2.8371,0.61,2.5986,4.7668,2.3649,0.9053,1.4136,6.556,2.6095,6.8052,1.6292,8.9558,0.7312,6.1433,1.9091,1.5791,2.3379,3.2068,2.6889,2.1122,8.5494,1.2222,3.3638,2.004,4.3619,2.478,4.6568,6.8093,2.4581,4.0506,1.9759,1.3749,1.784,2.496,2.8971,5.7986,1.6948,4.27,2.4855,6.0623,2.3455,4.2317,0.458,0.999,1.3758,5.1554,1.9393,3.1324,0.9656,0.7193,4.6699,1.5769,1.2901,0.2664,1.5258,4.9908,3.7465,3.7373,0.3312,4.9415,2.2296,2.2144,0.911,3.3779,5.5979,1.5006,6.1019,0.2817,2.7013,4.0019,5.1866,0.5861,1.9192,4.9342,0.993,0.1405,6.1461,0.2527,3.305,4.9767,2.1492,3.0876,2.3276,2.3424,0.0739,2.7271,7.214,0.0313,1.1724,8.1567,2.9704,1.6897,0.5227,0.9358,4.1803,0.6245,4.1315,0.002,4.9563,6.3353,1.7182,2.8487,0.1824,2.5059,6.1835,1.148,0.6228,1.381,4.3978,3.3838,1.711,0.5565,0.9245,4.2267,3.5283,0.5292,1.6835,0.6016,5.5698,6.4395,1.2354,0.0013,1.7301,1.4491,3.5419,3.1745,5.6507,1.9543,6.085,5.6186,0.0863,0.8556,0.636,1.3843,0.3697,1.8976,7.7556,5.2726,1.541,0.0007,2.5129,4.2439,0.4561,1.7467,3.4234,1.0354,1.5313,1.9119,1.8037,4.2256,2.5952,2.7403,4.6744,4.0234,3.9765,0.5417,2.0314,1.1349,1.8429,2.4496,6.9877,7.424,0.0431,0.0191,8.7169,0.9784,0.6838,6.6645,4.7996,0.0171,9.4083,0.7037,1.415,3.8337,2.2485,6.3158,0.1518,0.7413,4.0086,2.4147,1.9926,4.0405,6.2067,3.7477,4.1652,6.8295,2.6779,0.4318,3.6991,0.9432,5.6479,0.5937,4.5257,2.5505,1.7919,8.0877,1.2925,1.3137,3.099,5.5211,0.854,1.93,0.4552,2.754,2.5253,0.0193,1.1101,1.5923,0.6762,2.8186,5.6028,0.5967,5.1832,0.0571,4.152,0.0001,0.0212,2.879,2.918,1.6419,0.0015,0.6436,5.4326,1.186,9.9972,0.5894,0.4743,3.7709,2.5491,6.7481,4.7152,2.3992,0.1108,5.0478,1.7519,0.0005,0.8513,3.199,2.2424,0.0144,11.7354,5.2211,0.4207,0.1129,4.7698,0.3661,1.3366,0.0986,1.1351,0.852,4.095,0.0048,1.0184,5.5711,4.5062,0.9524,8.267,0.0494,2.4472,2.4599,5.7556,0.6282,11.5137,9.3042,2.2679,6.6595,0.0153,3.9158,8.8887,1.0727,6.4763,6.0614,3.3289,7.5753,3.8601,0.5347,0.9667,3.254,2.8944,0.7107,0.961,0.7314,4.598,5.7257,4.1808,5.8274,2.4901,4.2688,7.0133,7.0154,0.0332,5.0862,3.6441,0.103,3.9677,1.9016,4.2188,6.341,6.0758,5.9244,1.5154,1.5162,1.5254,2.6035,7.4914,0.2591,3.6978,2.3807,0.3082,3.9344,0.0083,8.7783,0.0693,0.7501,0.5495,3.9403,0.1411,6.0303,4.9128,1.3845,4.7163,12.21,7.6926,3.4188,2.3526]}

This force consisted of about 40,000 American personnel, 12,000 Allied personnel, more than 50,000 North Korean soldiers, and some 22,000 South Korean soldiers. After many years of bitter fighting, the United States and North Korea concluded a cease-fire at the Korean War, and President Park Chung-hee, a supporter of North Korea, stepped down from power. The United States and South Korea held their own peace talks and signed a peace treaty. Lee I-San was a war hero who played a role in the Korean War.\nIn 1952, Robert M. McNamara, then a lieutenant general, was appointed the Assistant Secretary for Plans and Chief of Staff to the President at the Pentagon. His main assignment was the preparation of plans for the Cold War. He was the architect for the war at Pearl Harbor, the decision to invade Germany, and the preparation of the Cold Vietnam War. In 1953, he was in charge of plans for a large group of troops that would be sent into Korea in 1953. His plans were approved in the following year by President Eisenhower and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On January 16, 1953, McNamara announced the initiation of the Korean War.\nIn 1958, McNamara was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1960, President Eisenhower appointed him to be Chief of Staff to the United States National Security Council. McNamara was instrumental in the development of the nuclear weapons program during the Cold War.","token_len":490,"entropy":[6.3789,5.5533,0.2929,2.6695,5.0431,0.8276,6.6971,1.9314,3.82,5.1558,2.1232,4.3562,4.8617,3.1199,1.7487,1.8762,5.4007,1.8645,7.1674,3.2813,7.1779,4.3037,0.2664,9.524,14.3691,3.8334,2.2353,4.5994,4.4801,2.2133,7.2118,3.3583,7.1176,10.5415,4.8395,0.943,1.3749,1.9266,5.9672,0.9189,0.5287,2.5732,8.163,0.5546,2.5649,5.3637,2.7644,1.3901,2.7573,1.33,2.4466,7.5205,8.9854,1.3677,2.2868,7.7532,0.9828,3.4095,3.0516,4.2661,5.3979,0.2055,0.912,0.799,1.1514,3.155,5.1695,1.3769,7.5388,1.5845,4.1572,4.4055,4.9825,5.5763,2.617,3.7328,8.7747,3.2687,8.5846,4.5753,0.9432,1.1562,8.6089,0.4107,1.8645,3.108,6.0691,6.2361,0.0579,4.6453,5.7006,0.2983,2.2463,2.3775,3.8361,6.6492,3.5954,1.4638,9.7468,8.1251,3.2867,5.0034,0.1232,2.1168,4.0431,7.1364,1.0408,1.8968,0.0513,3.2151,7.6318,5.5705,3.8479,5.1841,2.4877,0.2785,1.614,3.602,1.2257,0.5163,1.7546,2.413,3.0974,3.7513,0.9345,7.475,2.0532,1.726,1.2135,1.4828,4.7025,4.5992,2.1029,5.3462,0.1492,1.6825,4.0905,4.203,2.0061,4.3311,3.3889,4.3508,1.2821,3.6239,0.7835,1.1022,1.5583,2.0959,0.5315,1.6106,5.06,0.3601,12.0271,6.9857,1.1123,3.3057,4.2904,1.2557,1.6516,0.0608,0.4945,1.9222,5.1084,1.2672,2.7413,3.0581,0.0566,0.3935,1.9821,5.2381,0.095,0.881,6.5842,2.8243,1.4688,7.0197,0.6232,1.6694,0.5098,6.4414,6.2665,0.6406,4.7438,0.1058,3.543,1.5086,2.2734,1.4234,4.4223,0.0079,0.3156,5.1668,1.8555,1.796,1.007,0.4244,3.7289,3.9413,2.8088,0.3531,1.8814,4.0019,0.1443,0.0067,2.8066,3.0971,1.1759,6.3227,0.0783,0.2201,5.9682,1.1821,0.3358,5.9767,0.0571,3.538,0.1124,0.0025,4.3248,0.3847,2.2805,0.473,0.687,3.8848,5.6204,0.0135,0.0912,1.7819,0.1049,1.0545,0.3176,4.9083,6.2027,0.7212,0.3558,6.3213,1.7326,0.6054,0.8362,1.0158,0.2406,3.0261,2.5353,0.1446,4.6077,1.5909,4.23,0.1071,0.0115,4.6837,0.577,5.4519,1.227,3.2432,1.7644,5.4722,5.8772,1.2084,0.137,0.0851,2.7604,3.2049,4.8608,0.036,3.6223,0.1615,0.3093,6.2904,0.8381,1.7485,3.236,1.0919,2.0248,1.2781,0.2371,2.2336,1.7929,0.3707,5.0267,3.068,1.536,2.1818,0.3651,3.4138,2.8095,0.8189,0.8799,0.1796,1.7047,7.3224,5.1899,4.711,10.5918,2.0471,3.0465,6.0945,0.4372,2.1302,5.5649,0.4569,3.3481,0.0577,1.3839,2.3151,0.1338,0.8148,2.723,1.8656,4.0909,0.1825,6.2422,3.931,0.1576,4.1149,0.0831,0.7393,1.3789,2.6878,5.3243,1.4604,1.7394,1.7892,1.3719,3.1384,4.8301,0.1798,2.4967,5.1729,0.6258,8.4336,0.5588,0.2246,2.1966,0.8796,1.2368,4.1703,0.3303,2.6216,0.3402,3.9452,5.5032,4.9061,0.1677,3.4558,3.3017,0.3527,1.9577,0.2268,0.8049,6.0899,0.0012,0.5936,1.707,1.5043,3.0445,3.1437,4.773,0.5548,4.8925,5.3996,4.0956,0.004,1.0591,2.4265,6.9368,0.8268,2.844,4.524,0.9288,0.5626,0.4436,4.1104,0.2131,0.7206,4.9774,10.7446,0.4304,0.4735,2.6394,3.1194,0.2685,1.4539,0.9892,4.6489,0.2048,0.0162,4.0264,0.1954,3.0314,4.7288,5.8091,0.0213,3.1521,3.2002,0.7443,1.2701,1.0947,2.9634,2.7603,2.5941,4.5858,0.8247,3.6536,4.1755,1.3821,4.3266,2.8186,2.0624,3.7114,1.6111,1.0437,1.695,0.7197,1.7427,2.4431,0.2286,0.9325,2.0931,0.1149,0.0003,0.3488,4.2659,2.9181,4.0642,0.0448,1.4983,0.0455,1.8958,0.0005,2.5024,1.6931,6.1181,0.0197,0.9915,2.3871,0.0815,0.7769,2.0964,2.1423,4.6739,0.099,2.0028,0.0004,2.4406,2.9148,0.1375,1.4539,2.5398,0.0035,3.7754,0.3195,0.9001,1.9525,2.5401,0.1289,3.8737,1.186,2.3028,1.7283,1.0786,2.4158,5.3434,0.0669,0.083,3.3719,0.0835,2.1968,0.3829,5.3116,0.2535,0.0558,0.3484,2.0158,0.0005,1.3632,5.4811,0.0182,1.2281,3.0986,0.0723,0.3641,3.7025,1.2712,0.3604,4.2997,0.6908,1.0061,0.0014,0.4951]}

As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals , the ground","text":"The indigenous population believed that the pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling birds could not have gone extinct as a result of competition with the domestic cat. However, as mentioned above, the cats had not been introduced to the country until the 17th century. The indigenous ground-dwelling birds may have become extinct in prehistoric Manurupia as well as their predators. In that case, they may have disappeared by selective extinction as a consequence of human habitation and environmental changes, at least in the time spans studied here.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the coastal plain of south-eastern New Guinea, the indigenous canids were not as successful as their wild ancestors in exploiting their environment. The canids lost ground to a new group of predators that were introduced to the coastal plain with man : the feral dogs and cats. The indigenous canids that survived in the region after the last glaciation became increasingly specialized on small frugivores. Among the birds that lived in prehistoric Manurupia, the indigenous pigeons were one of the most specialized species. They were highly adapted to exploit the seeds of large trees, and suffered from a major extirpation with the decline of the indigenous canids. The introduction of the domestic cats and dogs to the coastal plain by human and their subsequent increase in abundance destroyed the indigenous population of pigeons. It appears that the native pigeons could not compete for food resources against the dogs and cats, at least in the time spans studied here. If we assume that similar conditions had prevailed in prehistoric Manurupia, then the indigenous pigeons may have gone extinct there as well, at least in several time spans. It is possible that the indigenous pigeons had previously disappeared either as a result of selective extinction as a consequence of environmental changes or earlier population crash.\nThe native lemurs had the greatest diversity of prey items in recent times. However, the indigenous catamount ( C. pygmaeus ) is an extremely efficient predator of these animals. As a consequence, the lemurs experienced heavy losses in recent times. It is likely that the lemurs of the coastal plain of south-eastern New Guinea were highly sensitive to the effects of the catamount as well as humans and the other predators that have invaded the region.","token_len":491,"entropy":[10.9125,2.791,9.3717,0.8713,1.2079,11.0772,6.9869,2.5136,3.1731,0.0028,6.1441,0.0148,0.9512,4.8088,2.0065,1.8325,5.2565,4.5901,0.6873,0.0979,0.2009,0.017,3.5492,0.5689,0.4414,4.5736,12.2535,4.0688,8.8547,4.487,6.3061,8.0656,10.2546,2.2925,6.4882,0.9689,2.0525,8.4202,2.2928,1.6254,0.0133,0.11,2.7386,3.7412,1.1241,2.1912,6.1215,0.1602,3.4131,2.3385,0.1212,0.2019,7.7294,1.5617,1.668,3.8718,3.2278,0.7899,3.1119,0.0383,3.2416,5.9372,1.1725,0.089,1.2199,6.5858,2.8604,3.1223,1.24,4.0969,0.8019,0.5053,5.0203,2.5024,1.5458,4.575,0.331,0.053,0.7991,2.2289,3.9461,9.2695,0.1176,0.0179,0.0002,0.0528,0.2943,4.2376,0.3595,4.2066,0.2138,2.643,6.1984,8.754,6.5298,9.7371,3.6752,2.9446,2.1042,2.0511,5.4421,7.074,1.443,3.1139,5.65,1.3335,0.1595,2.5037,1.7646,0.1884,4.721,4.0068,6.7149,4.8176,3.2093,1.4269,2.7627,0.0251,4.1301,5.1101,0.0944,1.962,5.2119,1.919,2.6517,6.009,0.2457,1.2893,1.2551,5.3513,7.5408,4.1272,3.2292,0.2306,1.1589,12.7398,1.2848,1.0742,8.5721,1.7659,9.2563,5.0361,0.7078,6.6886,0.6046,1.5584,0.0024,4.5349,1.2974,0.4468,1.5883,3.4143,8.0223,1.9458,1.9511,3.201,4.2347,3.7102,0.3671,2.3607,4.0738,2.7053,2.1551,6.0685,2.9922,3.839,0.9913,1.8181,5.1148,0.3552,5.1122,4.923,2.3101,4.0357,4.0721,3.37,0.311,2.7116,2.7176,2.2236,3.5619,1.5109,0.6495,3.0704,0.2063,4.6278,7.8892,9.9754,1.6188,2.303,2.0834,2.0774,2.3753,0.4408,1.4981,2.4904,1.3076,0.1388,5.0065,2.371,2.0653,0.8221,5.3978,4.6447,0.9057,5.1769,7.8313,0.0758,4.7085,5.6269,6.1657,5.6125,5.1181,6.0165,6.3771,1.3362,0.6736,1.9344,6.1918,0.8342,6.0502,1.235,4.1148,0.6164,8.8181,0.0932,0.0187,0.0129,0.006,1.006,1.0844,2.0144,5.7475,0.0002,1.2117,4.5823,0.0504,0.112,1.119,4.9214,2.8456,0.875,2.9064,1.2691,4.3792,2.162,0.3579,8.4697,0.83,10.1496,0.599,5.5195,3.9473,1.7724,1.8322,7.7601,0.9248,2.0497,6.0596,9.7365,1.3675,0.0019,0.0479,5.2735,1.1977,5.4722,0.0825,1.1043,3.5857,3.0009,0.3777,0.5794,1.6484,5.1409,0.0582,1.4453,3.9167,0.986,1.7336,2.6363,1.72,0.5435,0.5191,0.0615,3.5827,4.3818,4.8634,4.2796,4.5049,5.0768,0.132,5.5046,8.432,0.5762,0.8479,3.8628,1.1999,2.2634,0.0004,0.8879,3.6191,3.8484,0.1381,0.9019,3.7909,1.1633,0.001,3.7217,0.3523,4.1438,2.7016,1.4307,5.9611,5.305,0.5977,6.1812,0.7549,0.1261,2.3811,4.6416,0.0416,1.2995,0.8269,1.8714,1.1975,0.3119,0.0612,0.1512,5.3085,3.317,1.9551,0.2293,8.7389,3.0825,3.5529,2.1573,0.7283,3.3723,0.0475,0.0028,0.0029,0.0042,0.4183,1.9102,0.8186,1.4314,1.2187,0.001,1.8153,0.2306,4.2119,0.0045,6.7546,1.8373,0.5169,1.9644,3.3408,0.0313,1.1472,7.6361,5.0301,0.8979,1.0891,3.2356,0.6573,1.7654,0.107,0.9468,1.6538,0.7939,0.0008,3.183,6.6317,2.6438,6.8838,2.3341,0.5151,0.4861,0.0021,3.7265,0.5415,3.1482,0.7607,0.3083,0.0011,6.1596,0.313,0.8455,9.0807,3.9379,10.5828,0.7879,2.0493,2.0517,4.0257,10.2748,2.6194,0.0192,3.8428,3.9018,2.7829,4.1567,0.6264,3.9397,6.1138,1.7589,6.5893,1.0671,0.9239,4.0804,0.04,1.626,2.6938,5.7707,9.7888,4.7219,10.1786,2.0024,5.878,0.6247,2.3244,0.7627,0.5018,2.9972,4.0506,3.184,6.9725,1.1038,2.5645,3.7163,2.6233,0.7018,3.9477,1.7539,1.7333,0.3435,1.2067,1.9956,0.0632,0.0142,5.8165,6.7056,1.6405,1.4624,5.3711,0.734,1.1453,3.271,0.5191,2.754,0.0495,0.8957,1.8848,0.1051,0.0107,3.7778,1.2412,1.1875,0.1047,2.8879,3.538,0.0524,0.0893,0.0032,0.5789,0.0015,1.5138,5.4498,4.3268,0.09,1.1793,3.1156,0.015,2.3509,3.0861,5.8422,4.204,0.9145,0.9905,6.7337,2.8826,2.653,4.3539,2.9215,1.8507,4.4718,3.6277,0.9479,3.1678,0.8181]}

Several thousand fans attended the dedication as well as Wagner himself. His failing health caused him to skip the dedication and the team did not play as scheduled. In the spring of 1956, the team moved to their final home field of Forbes Field. The new stadium, named The Honus Wagner Field, was the first to feature a seating capacity exceeding 45,000 people. The final game of the season the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Boston Braves 7\u20132 on October 13, 1956. There were more than 35,000 fans in attendance. The Reds won the 1955\u201356 National League Championship. Prior to a scheduled game on February 11, 1956, Honus Wagner died of a heart attack. A plaque marking his spot in the lower field deck was erected at Forbes Field on March 8, 1956 by the Cincinnati Reds, the Cincinnati Park Rangers, and Major League Baseball.  The plaque has since fallen from its marker and was found during work on the field's renovation. Honus Wagner Field was sold to the Cleveland Indians in 1967. After that time, the home of the Cleveland Indians has alternated between Forbes Field (1966\u201370), Comiskey Park (1971\u201385), Minute Maid Park (1998\u20132004), and Citizens Bank Park (2005\u201318). On November 20, 2004 the Indians completed plans to construct a new $450 million ballpark and relocate from Citizens Bank Park to this new stadium.  The new ballpark opened in May 2007 with a preseason home opener between the Cleveland Indians and the Colorado Rockies.  On August 11, 2007, the MLB acquired the old Forbes field (now the Cleveland Indians' home) from the City of Cleveland.  That month, the MLB acquired the old home field of the Cincinnati Reds, now known as The Honus Wagner Field and renamed The Chase Manhattan Bank Center, and it was announced that the ballpark would be demolished and the site of The Chase Manhattan Bank Center would be used for an arenas.  The arenas was built in time for the 2007 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, the first World Series to take place on an arenas field.\nIn 2003, Major League Baseball erected two commemorative plaques in Honus Wagner Field marking the spot of Honus Wagner's final home-field game with the Chicago Cubs and the final home game of Bill Russell in Major League Baseball.","token_len":492,"entropy":[11.048,0.2711,2.9433,8.0366,0.264,8.2983,5.252,0.5221,1.2044,5.1469,1.0719,8.8079,1.4915,6.2147,6.6668,7.8326,0.0083,9.16,3.198,0.8341,6.4762,4.2765,3.211,2.1767,0.7773,2.6306,4.2054,1.1494,1.0931,5.0297,2.2277,0.6582,4.7347,13.2456,1.5593,3.0906,0.6444,0.0506,6.2366,1.16,4.9944,1.576,4.6577,4.4713,4.7483,0.059,1.7442,4.8497,2.6351,0.7705,2.6894,2.4347,3.3094,0.0257,1.5779,0.14,1.3802,1.5421,2.6251,0.3442,6.0195,6.1455,0.8883,6.052,2.1492,7.1742,0.1372,0.9592,1.8088,3.7605,1.1483,2.3984,2.876,4.5588,6.6029,0.0375,1.5688,2.6175,0.3195,0.7588,4.0289,1.6082,2.7169,2.4748,1.0332,5.2102,0.4161,5.4123,6.2518,0.0296,0.0546,3.3173,0.319,1.4594,5.7427,2.307,0.8618,0.1545,0.5829,6.7891,6.6376,0.3212,2.0568,0.113,3.8262,3.6302,2.9917,5.019,2.0046,2.183,2.954,3.7153,0.2024,0.2911,0.5881,5.7547,1.0914,3.7709,0.1675,4.933,0.0695,0.0126,0.723,1.656,0.1622,1.4317,1.5338,4.6512,1.0043,0.8701,7.0897,8.6824,0.0324,1.7778,0.2016,1.0417,1.6402,6.1943,0.0031,5.3887,4.6103,2.027,2.2867,4.2885,3.3618,0.1303,0.7992,0.1415,5.679,0.0049,0.1232,4.4979,1.4695,1.2209,0.547,0.0259,1.1119,3.8537,2.9184,4.9109,0.9361,6.8511,2.0383,0.614,9.4168,5.248,8.2255,1.5448,2.1853,1.9842,1.5224,0.1434,1.82,2.3945,3.3562,0.2089,0.4869,6.4395,1.3532,1.1435,0.6127,2.8351,2.5964,2.9195,6.5921,4.0542,0.509,0.5343,5.8879,0.0172,0.038,0.4672,8.633,7.6866,4.1216,3.8769,2.0285,7.3098,2.6324,3.3388,8.9035,2.1763,2.8132,5.8006,5.5996,6.5132,0.6642,0.4669,3.8623,5.1726,5.5051,0.5373,3.7655,0.0027,0.223,3.8807,1.3419,4.9515,0.8715,0.8554,3.394,0.3201,0.8839,3.6927,0.6344,4.3735,4.0812,3.7368,0.2631,0.7061,4.2185,2.2607,0.5466,3.3276,0.1074,5.1993,9.5725,0.404,0.9551,3.9904,0.4113,3.879,7.1486,1.9824,2.1426,2.1767,5.0214,1.5808,0.0007,1.0078,0.1575,1.6601,0.0534,5.7231,0.304,8.0811,0.0095,0.0322,0.0426,5.977,0.0508,2.9341,0.2091,0.6568,6.765,0.0438,0.6407,0.1224,2.0783,0.0511,4.9985,0.2513,4.6419,3.0007,3.388,0.0197,3.5073,2.8027,3.2917,5.4616,6.6122,0.6662,2.8155,0.6054,0.7052,4.4332,6.0445,0.0617,2.0576,3.1509,6.3706,3.9007,8.0196,0.0078,0.3474,0.4359,5.6332,0.9728,2.3963,0.4079,2.7345,0.977,1.7752,0.7544,4.5789,0.6715,3.318,2.5983,3.2483,1.1065,8.1071,1.9269,2.6566,4.1041,0.4117,1.994,0.0845,0.0679,0.485,5.314,0.029,0.8218,1.6884,4.0477,2.2957,3.2704,0.0345,1.591,0.4356,0.4392,5.7865,4.6085,0.5119,7.9298,2.7731,5.2363,4.2566,2.7109,2.5986,3.1172,0.196,1.6775,1.5002,1.3574,0.971,0.1045,7.2216,0.0774,0.7114,1.0326,1.1349,6.5487,5.3963,0.4372,0.504,4.1936,2.4828,0.4454,3.7169,3.901,2.6722,2.3774,1.4346,1.5718,0.108,2.4783,4.8556,1.6968,0.0337,2.0089,0.2474,0.0006,0.128,0.0184,3.9588,1.8474,1.7885,6.3925,7.7621,4.4307,1.9075,2.7956,2.647,4.631,1.1707,5.206,0.3753,0.6182,3.2951,0.2672,0.722,3.5097,1.9261,1.9628,5.0269,3.2852,2.8554,2.9285,0.1597,0.1372,0.1752,1.6749,0.2168,4.1358,0.9806,3.7799,12.2806,1.914,1.1996,0.9221,10.5618,6.7097,2.8484,1.1315,7.4128,0.1764,0.4859,7.08,2.1132,0.0949,2.0685,0.072,3.8407,0.0008,0.3027,0.0394,0.1912,2.3865,0.3648,0.0101,1.9133,2.4807,1.7031,2.315,0.0131,2.4142,3.5776,0.0009,3.1262,3.385,9.4305,4.2648,0.5781,3.3148,6.8593,4.6343,0.2484,5.0676,0.0035,0.0112,9.2396,4.2506,6.3221,0.0167,5.4104,0.0105,2.2884,4.6252,0.001,0.0908,0.2222,5.2059,0.6286,7.5282,2.5304,3.2793,0.0023,0.2013,0.7503,4.7955,2.0879,5.7012,0.7256,1.7321,3.373,0.0719,3.3452,0.598,3.9585,0.5944,4.0728,1.005,1.4748,0.4156,8.5227,1.8276,4.431,5.7328,0.0045,0.0213,0.9307]}

He sought","text":"A supporter of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance would lead to a harmonious, moral society. He sought to reform society through the institutions of the Church and by encouraging the people of England to be more self - reliant. This was a very popular approach to the cause of reform. In 1765, as Archbishop of Canterbury, he issued his celebrated Statement on the Principles on which Government is founded. These included the assertion that the British constitution is founded on a natural right of individual liberty. He also argued that, although the state is a collective endeavour of men bound together in order to provide themselves with certain mutual benefits, it is ultimately the concern of individuals. He also believed that government has a duty to ensure that individuals have the conditions conducive to an independent moral life. He further asserted that, in a society where the rights of an individual were respected and protected, all other moral duties were also fulfilled and that no government could make laws contrary to the natural rights of man. The statement has remained an authoritative document of the Church of England for over 260 years and is still used as a teaching resource in some Anglican schools.\nWilberforce had many followers in Parliament. Following a speech by William Pitt the Younger he and others formed the'Wilberforce Association ', an organisation which attempted to convince parliament of the existence of a need for reforms. It had a limited success although it was instrumental in obtaining a vote on the establishment of a House of Commons Library. For his work on behalf of the abolition of the slave trade, Wilberforce received many grants of land from the government. In 1787 he was appointed one of the judges of the Court of Chancery. He was also elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1788 and received the honour of knighthood from Queen Charlotte on the 30th September of that year. The following year, he was made a Privy Counsellor by George II and was given the title of Baron Kilkenny in 1792.\nWilberforce retired in 1797, shortly before his death, the result of a heart attack. He died in London on 24th December 1801. His work in the service of humanity inspired others, and he was the father of the Industrial Revolution in Ireland. He is commemorated in the name of the Irish city of Kilkenny and the English city of Lewisham","token_len":493,"entropy":[10.4361,0.6901,1.9472,9.9405,4.4503,0.0745,0.3549,4.0607,0.5225,2.9655,1.6702,7.3587,3.7772,0.0316,6.8378,0.8751,1.6769,12.0364,1.4931,0.0606,1.0944,1.7406,3.6331,7.3075,4.7431,7.5904,0.1892,1.7761,2.2946,0.1162,1.1376,5.7419,0.0606,3.2796,5.3618,3.173,0.6619,1.8452,6.0898,0.4648,5.6719,4.4287,1.8116,1.5802,6.5423,0.5034,1.1929,0.7618,1.7849,3.3457,3.8526,1.9367,5.3267,2.7369,1.4404,0.153,3.1347,2.4293,3.9834,9.6934,7.6699,2.2782,3.6583,1.6979,2.1581,3.747,3.6552,3.7983,1.2063,1.9189,5.7101,0.5394,3.1866,1.2007,3.1398,3.0875,4.7227,1.1155,5.4576,5.5553,0.7359,0.2121,0.5021,1.5167,4.4421,2.8784,7.7189,5.1452,0.8233,0.9092,5.2993,4.8851,4.2754,8.054,2.3845,1.0437,0.831,4.4081,3.3364,1.0987,7.4428,0.308,1.3103,5.6395,4.1435,2.2388,3.3068,0.2944,2.2836,5.9826,2.5391,1.1054,2.6039,1.1891,1.5554,2.1037,2.0881,3.9966,0.2455,3.8362,3.032,1.0521,5.018,1.7806,2.4147,6.0793,5.2871,2.7112,3.4819,7.4915,0.5219,2.3329,5.0408,0.1356,3.2311,6.8959,0.3237,4.7145,6.4929,1.4302,0.3291,1.3867,0.5775,4.5148,1.8962,8.6035,0.0484,3.2851,4.3524,1.7363,2.6688,3.8999,0.1365,4.3651,4.2279,1.4912,1.8597,0.2077,3.2248,0.7014,2.3804,1.6102,1.1436,7.0632,6.2332,0.0273,4.5539,3.4723,4.7148,1.3858,0.8391,1.6978,4.4334,3.928,0.1338,2.3962,1.8779,2.8742,1.2069,1.6042,1.7637,4.2363,0.351,5.6037,0.0341,3.7038,4.413,1.4571,2.926,0.5179,4.825,3.8691,5.5641,2.9074,1.4303,4.6042,4.891,2.9318,0.9411,3.5749,3.8434,1.2549,4.4891,4.361,5.0368,0.0076,0.9569,4.2148,1.1541,0.1852,2.9618,0.2512,2.7402,3.2346,4.488,3.9347,3.0608,4.0483,1.435,2.1894,0.8798,1.5975,1.9653,0.0032,2.0837,1.3355,7.7503,0.0085,2.2614,1.7698,2.4271,1.7767,2.5494,0.6812,3.4527,3.5183,1.6191,4.1791,4.3269,0.0305,1.9188,0.6215,1.5787,10.1944,0.0116,0.0004,4.4347,3.1257,4.7274,1.2256,5.6445,1.1536,6.5418,3.5081,4.5003,2.1408,3.706,4.8145,4.4298,5.3086,5.4559,5.3269,3.0378,4.7878,0.656,12.3837,6.4242,0.0492,0.0108,4.8028,8.1017,3.6935,1.7534,1.4604,5.9009,0.0335,5.7444,4.3966,2.4179,0.5641,5.7063,0.0522,0.9993,6.2095,0.2541,4.4409,1.3346,2.9872,3.4789,2.2928,6.0852,3.3511,5.9643,1.2273,1.5098,4.9545,0.0678,6.4378,2.1043,4.8707,2.6212,0.9339,6.4012,0.0169,1.2257,4.9656,0.0458,2.252,9.1707,1.018,5.866,3.8394,3.1831,1.9443,3.8181,0.0042,0.9202,5.784,0.1182,1.4395,5.056,0.1217,0.9349,0.6721,0.0049,0.0006,3.5905,3.0315,4.7565,2.2297,4.3617,1.644,0.6863,3.3765,0.773,2.3081,0.6795,3.3979,0.8932,1.7379,1.5966,6.3948,0.0178,0.3287,5.2958,0.4791,0.2199,3.3273,0.0468,5.5335,0.0681,0.0001,1.1768,1.4449,1.1664,1.5797,2.6065,6.3811,0.2637,0.2114,1.7535,0.8289,2.2866,0.9029,2.6973,1.1382,4.2318,1.142,3.8315,0.0886,8.0067,0.0007,0.0001,2.1148,2.6935,5.4206,3.4932,2.6086,4.6921,0.0275,4.558,4.1687,0.2498,0.0146,0.063,3.3471,2.9085,0.0861,1.5631,1.493,0.8157,4.949,1.7633,7.3391,0.0012,3.25,2.3295,0.005,2.6208,5.2923,2.7655,1.7655,2.1385,4.3171,0.5525,1.6189,0.2835,4.2111,8.705,3.0534,0.0131,2.8248,1.1923,2.0281,0.1512,1.7422,0.5394,0.0143,0.0009,7.0247,1.7976,1.256,2.7979,2.1531,5.9913,1.877,1.7775,0.307,1.0311,5.6373,4.8756,0.0503,1.5855,5.7273,0.0731,0.7124,1.0309,1.4602,1.1382,2.3174,0.8025,4.169,1.045,2.4459,2.6642,2.7887,0.4152,2.2208,4.3772,2.7162,1.2398,4.4469,0.0387,5.5324,5.4546,3.4583,2.5175,1.6046,1.7434,1.1828,3.1817,4.9195,0.1297,1.5056,8.0061,0.4449,3.1116,6.841,0.5943,1.8808,2.6224,5.2963,0.0106,1.1436,0.8982,6.6334,0.0173,1.0938,4.4309,8.1546,0.266,3.2213,0.0791,0.0016,2.6869,1.7021,5.3053,1.6653,0.0466,6.4773,0.8038,0.0027]}

The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along which they were to rendezvous and transfer out to a deep space interplanetary launch vehicle as necessary, perhaps using an in-orbit transfer from the Space Shuttle to the Deep Space 1 or 2 mission.\nIn February 2004, NPO Earthsat and the Finnish Ministry of Defense signed a contract to provide one of the two satellites built upon the NPO Earthsat and RKK Energia design. The satellite's orbital configuration was a perigee of about 700 kilometres (430\u00a0mi), an apogee of about 40,000 kilometres (25,000\u00a0mi), and an inclination of about 98 degrees from the ecliptic. The satellite is intended for remote sensing from space on weather forecasting and environmental assessment, and would be capable of measuring weather parameters, the thickness of the ice cover, and the mass distribution of the Earth's upper atmosphere.\nOn 2 May 2005, a Russian government decree gave a contract to the Progress M series launch vehicle design company and a Ukrainian company named UkrAero. A contract was signed on 1 February 2005 with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to provide a communication spacecraft. A second contract was signed on that same date with ESA to design the NPO Earthsat-East satellite. ESA is considering using this satellite as one of several for use in the first space mission of the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Constellation program.  ESA is expected to confirm all satellite mission requirements and cost at a Board level meeting in May 2006.  This contract was signed between the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and NPO Earthsat to design and build one spacecraft with a single Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude between 300 and 400 kilometres (190 and 240\u00a0mi) and inclination of 98 degrees from the ecliptic. NPO Earthsat and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are also engaged to work out the details on the commercial operation (COT), launch, and the satellite usage.\nIn November 2005, the Russian government announced that a contract has been awarded to NPO Earthsat to provide one of two satellites. The contract for both satellites was awarded on 30 November 2005 to the NPO Earthsat and RKK Energia.","token_len":495,"entropy":[12.8376,5.0107,5.5272,1.2635,7.7384,0.11,0.0018,0.0209,0.1885,14.4703,9.5452,0.1518,3.5363,7.3786,1.6333,7.3603,1.7068,2.9741,5.9768,0.8162,0.0213,1.4075,1.6224,4.0319,0.0222,1.5809,0.2258,6.0118,1.815,4.1061,4.5541,0.4042,0.0004,7.8031,1.1793,9.8696,2.6852,0.0378,0.0108,0.81,1.6584,5.9872,3.1989,2.5264,4.8854,1.3488,3.6121,0.0013,2.2162,6.1294,7.4629,2.9123,2.4701,5.8795,0.652,7.2507,0.2866,0.0001,5.1411,2.2837,5.702,6.2398,3.312,6.1296,4.3704,2.6588,4.9511,0.1084,1.5554,5.0022,6.1459,1.328,3.5215,0.8047,2.6624,1.2015,7.1048,0.0116,7.5865,3.9494,0.9152,3.6317,0.6269,0.9515,9.7235,4.8969,4.4005,0.2356,7.5594,5.2244,7.9334,5.3487,4.0244,2.4771,10.0264,6.7894,0.0416,1.5985,4.2586,0.6548,1.7913,1.1641,2.5294,5.9932,1.0675,0.3188,3.0836,4.1379,6.2985,6.1088,0.8021,4.7178,0.1479,2.1183,0.1281,3.6133,6.7825,6.7469,5.9001,0.9964,0.2648,5.091,1.1194,0.9888,4.5784,3.4086,5.3945,2.9896,1.3979,3.7933,8.6686,1.2761,0.0024,2.4834,2.2617,5.3674,3.6157,1.3472,5.0231,15.996,4.3784,1.4122,4.3901,7.5224,0.1108,0.0002,0.2312,1.207,4.5398,2.704,0.0343,0.2628,0.4423,2.7972,0.0679,0.1966,3.25,0.3549,1.0093,0.3708,1.585,2.3014,0.0818,0.8632,6.7199,1.0266,4.9982,0.4939,7.3052,0.0832,0.0001,0.0051,0.4627,0.986,2.5657,3.4551,4.0578,1.9967,7.6556,0.7881,5.4478,2.2792,5.0608,8.4854,3.793,1.5137,5.3363,4.469,2.2433,1.1824,2.726,1.4171,3.2486,0.0115,4.555,4.7372,4.3184,2.8542,4.7433,6.3336,0.2075,1.2463,3.2907,3.8452,0.6506,0.876,1.014,5.8936,4.4632,0.3101,1.2487,2.4738,0.9715,4.2746,0.2077,0.3457,0.988,3.8677,4.5509,2.2681,2.0936,0.1804,3.0983,4.006,4.378,5.0551,4.174,3.3291,3.2094,0.2903,1.5284,8.4027,5.8733,7.3955,4.6121,0.4756,5.5068,2.1526,4.2744,2.635,6.3231,1.3866,5.0813,7.5747,2.294,4.6391,5.4692,2.8928,3.718,2.2514,1.0829,0.8471,1.7824,2.3911,3.5649,3.0436,3.0093,1.0919,6.7619,2.573,0.0527,1.8828,2.6423,1.8622,0.5574,1.3976,1.8942,1.8815,8.3275,4.6238,3.5648,2.9911,3.1238,0.7089,0.3744,0.259,0.22,10.1596,0.5117,2.1284,0.628,5.1916,2.4228,4.5264,2.3011,4.4268,0.3937,2.4537,0.1036,4.2248,10.8004,5.3138,0.7793,4.8283,3.6186,6.0885,3.7165,2.9221,1.8149,1.6884,5.7634,0.0458,3.3761,5.5434,4.3184,0.7627,1.8477,5.6721,4.4307,1.6275,1.8396,0.4168,3.8354,0.1594,0.002,12.4886,7.6021,5.5202,2.7497,0.3143,0.7658,6.5559,0.0001,1.339,0.5938,5.8344,12.8575,1.815,4.1689,0.0184,7.1728,5.6586,6.2776,7.3183,3.212,2.5572,6.6782,6.3509,2.0282,9.5513,4.237,1.4978,1.0614,3.3873,0.8895,0.2623,2.417,4.3971,3.0344,1.7486,1.1025,3.9441,1.3894,3.039,0.4296,0.0079,0.3575,0.0427,0.0167,0.0373,0.1031,4.2362,0.0273,1.0643,0.0179,4.2149,1.0322,1.4223,1.3878,3.818,5.9449,3.2444,1.3121,5.0137,10.8845,1.5574,3.0713,0.0087,0.0839,1.8751,5.146,2.8483,0.7856,4.6895,4.3458,0.8957,1.6395,1.2783,0.156,4.4265,0.9038,3.5798,2.8378,0.1474,1.3489,1.708,6.4875,0.387,4.6032,0.1479,1.0914,0.135,0.0855,0.0004,0.0034,0.0081,0.2301,4.3136,0.0239,0.2543,0.01,2.0912,1.19,2.4311,0.7066,0.0083,0.9869,0.0238,0.0131,0.0139,1.5628,2.5187,6.2912,3.5927,4.0651,3.0641,1.3485,4.1269,4.3984,0.979,6.187,5.9492,6.3232,4.1707,3.2892,3.1529,4.7644,1.3871,0.4989,4.7529,5.4194,8.478,1.0757,1.0576,2.4895,3.4462,1.1995,0.2034,1.0807,2.3578,1.3802,2.1621,1.0902,3.0455,1.5491,4.6884,0.0298,1.8998,0.4163,3.2311,0.0286,0.7459,0.0179,1.6562,2.5822,2.5267,0.1231,3.26,1.8481,3.4117,0.9678,1.9734,3.6745,4.3851,1.3674,1.3637,2.3043,1.079,3.7561,1.7686,0.437,2.8835,1.5399,3.6692,0.0202,1.124,0.0276,2.4514,1.9216,0.0054,0.0233,0.0001,0.0005,3.3275]}

In particular, this is true of the < unk > formed by all unk values that appear in some positive integer n, no matter how high n gets.\nFor example, consider the following binary integer n = 2 9 + 2 4 + 2 7 + 2 8. Here < unk > is DAG with 14 arcs, that is, one of all unk values that appear in number n and all of them have been oriented.\nThere is an alternative directed graph < n > which would result in an equivalent decomposition.\nIt is one directed graph consisting of three arcs ; the first arc connecting 1 and 2 ; the second one connecting 2 and 4, and the third between 4 and 7.\nThe second and third arcs connect 1 with 2, 2 with 4 and vice versa. All vertices have valency 3, except 4 which has valency 4.\nThe vertex set of < n > is the set of all binary sequences of length n ( in other words, all binary trees ) that contains in some position the sequence 2...\n( unk ) as part of its extension.\nThe only sequences of length 9 that do not belong to < 9 > are 1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1, hence the first arc connects 2 with 1.\nThe second arc points to 0 and 1. The third arc connects 1 with 0,0,0,0.\nFrom any two sequences v u of < n >, it is possible to extract the unk in v, that is, the sequence u of unk values such that each value i occurs in u with the probability given by the valency of vi, and the unk value occurs in u with probability given by the probability that u contains each of the unk values j in an ordering. This is the basis of the standard formulae used to evaluate n-point probabilities.\nHowever, with this definition, it is impossible to apply the methods that were developed from the point of view of directed trees to determine the probabilities < n >. In a polytree, the edges are oriented from root to leaves, but the ordering in the root is not important, because all leaves are adjacent and there are no cycles. This makes the analysis somewhat easier.","token_len":495,"entropy":[10.7163,12.4223,2.6811,1.1936,10.6949,2.4343,5.8467,0.9729,9.099,1.1818,1.1809,4.3146,0.2639,1.0395,8.2066,5.9084,1.9322,6.2747,4.1325,1.0198,1.3792,1.5972,7.0904,3.7252,2.5512,3.5672,4.603,0.1997,4.7902,1.5852,3.3425,1.4755,2.3476,8.192,10.361,7.0965,3.1255,9.9493,0.3309,4.4815,4.6939,0.1349,5.193,4.3783,4.8605,0.8176,6.2857,8.4448,3.5993,4.713,3.2623,6.4962,0.7265,0.7181,4.1955,4.9192,7.4385,0.446,1.644,8.9119,1.3075,0.216,2.7494,0.8614,1.2819,5.3195,7.1212,2.9405,2.1575,2.555,8.2113,3.9277,1.9883,3.3775,1.2652,0.8314,2.3871,0.872,0.5066,1.9533,3.5798,5.4995,7.3616,0.9958,0.0078,0.2271,0.553,7.625,0.0087,4.5332,8.6792,10.5232,1.8503,5.0334,0.8448,0.4391,4.4425,3.0277,5.0014,3.6375,0.0196,0.4853,2.658,1.6014,0.2004,7.6478,0.5499,3.7897,3.5946,1.7984,2.5653,2.3299,4.7057,5.8854,3.0934,1.6313,4.463,1.325,2.753,3.6718,10.3521,0.2248,7.5768,3.1908,0.5875,3.1795,5.3354,5.1222,0.0865,2.4783,5.8532,10.5607,0.1227,2.1685,2.0192,4.4857,0.602,5.8061,10.2712,0.4232,4.6319,0.0435,3.469,3.2647,7.7328,1.8303,1.1635,2.025,10.3327,4.1354,2.5446,0.8625,6.9091,0.1165,0.1577,3.7961,0.2453,2.4251,0.057,2.8094,3.243,0.3594,0.2441,0.216,7.5647,1.8573,0.0397,2.1841,0.5179,1.1222,1.7473,3.4091,3.209,0.2849,0.3929,4.8158,2.0949,5.3538,1.4709,1.5537,2.9131,1.1104,2.7057,2.2033,8.3165,0.1004,0.5628,5.7384,6.2527,0.0001,3.6811,10.7849,4.8831,5.0577,1.7026,5.8751,3.0858,2.2194,1.197,2.1628,0.002,2.0802,0.8158,0.8334,1.1743,6.773,6.0102,1.9372,3.0171,0.5975,0.1313,0.6746,2.8534,2.8547,0.1631,1.2598,7.8483,5.6351,1.806,5.1825,0.6368,3.6634,7.2283,3.9035,0.01,0.3996,2.2715,3.2129,6.7982,5.1797,1.7548,5.5051,6.0139,4.1756,6.0128,2.3491,4.2739,5.0543,8.965,4.0466,4.1051,7.9532,0.0229,2.6652,5.5214,5.6967,0.0121,3.4042,7.7225,1.9396,0.9419,1.4916,5.87,6.9404,1.523,0.8573,7.7189,1.0921,2.3205,0.0242,4.2312,0.2869,2.1749,10.6006,2.475,0.2815,3.7888,0.9478,5.4256,0.5309,1.1777,0.5376,0.6912,0.4341,0.5088,0.3472,3.4801,0.4199,0.813,0.3475,0.4891,0.3144,0.4651,0.281,1.6265,0.1874,0.9396,0.1684,14.9405,1.777,3.6267,3.5246,5.1437,2.4634,2.0979,1.6887,1.9215,0.6434,1.0943,1.4061,0.285,6.0,0.5896,3.3946,1.8378,2.8999,1.3619,2.3015,0.3868,0.4664,3.3037,1.6321,0.4028,1.0341,1.8932,3.792,0.9084,0.433,0.5082,0.2873,1.8467,0.7606,5.662,5.1517,4.8482,3.1514,9.3849,7.826,4.2832,1.4668,0.3664,0.2015,1.9827,3.3373,0.6069,0.6437,0.1047,5.0483,1.4473,5.5283,0.1726,5.2737,5.3406,4.8242,4.2326,0.0349,0.151,1.5115,2.9575,2.7694,2.0061,3.2116,0.0547,2.2755,5.9576,0.4416,4.211,3.2737,6.2067,6.9352,0.448,3.7532,3.6855,2.1702,5.9457,6.1193,0.308,1.2945,6.7681,0.219,1.1177,9.8925,3.3128,2.1908,1.9172,2.0239,0.0155,1.8594,7.3021,0.2178,1.4462,0.2175,3.9084,4.6168,0.0184,0.6456,2.8056,3.6059,3.9799,3.9576,5.92,2.224,0.8743,1.2494,0.0195,0.2454,5.3945,3.5878,6.3646,7.2282,3.0724,2.7732,1.1851,2.5024,5.9461,0.5551,0.825,5.5676,4.5084,4.8801,0.0264,3.7132,1.5311,4.1409,5.8707,2.1644,6.7532,7.0336,0.5883,0.6047,5.4679,0.0405,4.9426,3.6102,4.7832,0.8724,2.2762,0.3923,3.0219,0.0898,4.2721,1.0686,6.0416,3.6676,3.0672,3.3355,4.6773,1.0639,5.5978,0.8572,0.0615,0.0376,8.9756,3.6111,2.0025,5.8812,0.8722,4.9231,7.9049,0.5892,0.7296,1.5993,2.8532,4.667,5.5638,0.4839,0.7114,1.4494,8.1765,2.3126,3.7666,4.2547,7.1841,0.5339,8.559,1.1734,3.0396,1.4237,7.5682,4.2637,1.9377,4.3465,2.0282,1.613,4.3555,2.1757,1.7919,3.0024,4.3073,0.9471,4.348,3.7457,3.665,1.177,0.5498,7.8179,1.3758,3.0404,3.2546,1.3117,5.5068,4.9309,3.6567,1.0616]}

Swimmers trained at nearby Uxbridge Lido, and female athletes were housed at RAF West Drayton. The first woman in Britain to win an Olympic medal, Kate Archibald, trained at RAF West Drayton. In 1949 all athletics competitions were moved to a stadium outside Buckingham Palace. By 1956 there was only one athletics venue left: the Victoria Stadium in Highbury. When the stadium went out of use the club moved to Chiswick Recreation Ground.\n\nLater years\n\nSince 1962 the club have had little competition as most clubs have moved to indoor courts, to help their finances. The club now operates a recreational centre at Chiswick Recreation Ground which holds a number of social events and coaching sessions.\n\nCoaching\n\nThe club have a strong coaching arm, offering both indoor and outdoor coaching services both through The Royal Boxing Academy and RAF Boxing Academy (an outdoor league) which was awarded the All Sport Coaching Gold Award in 2010.  The Academy works alongside its affiliated school, the London South Olympic School. Other areas of interest include coaching with the United States, Russia and other countries in the gymkhana style.\n\nFight record\n\nThe club's record for losses is 697, with over 3,000 fighters who have trained for the club throughout its history.  The largest number of fighters came from Afghanistan with over 180 and Pakistan with over 100 members. The second largest number of fighters came from Britain and Europe with several hundred in each category. The most renowned fighter is Fahim Khan, who became professional boxer at London and Paris.

The genus Leptospira includes more than 100 species and subspecies. While Leptospira bacteria can affect humans and animals of both rodents and mammals, the human species is the most commonly affected. The disease can be transmitted through contact with infected body fluids and through direct (in person-to-person) infection from the urine, saliva, and mucus of an infected animal, which can include people, companion animals, pets, and farm animals. The bacteria enters the body through contaminated fluids or tissue. The severity of the disease ranges from mild illness to acute or chronic disease with fatal outcome in up to 15% of infected patients. The main modes of infection include through infected urine or water, contact with urine or fluids collected from an infected animal (i.e., contact with an infected dog or cat's urine or feces), direct contact with tissue, bites, and abrasions. Signs and symptoms of leptospirosis include fever, headache, muscle or joint pain, sweating, rash, diarrhea, and vomiting. Less common but more serious symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, renal failure, and hepatitis. Infected human carriers who do not seek treatment may transmit infection to others by contact with an infected animal or contaminated water. In particular, infected dog and cat urine is a common source of risk for human infection and transmission of infection occurs if dogs and cats enter water, such as sewerage. Transmission is common in endemic areas where an adequate water supply does not exist and where dogs are not vaccinated against leptospirosis. Infection is considered endemic where the bacteria are frequently isolated in the urine of dogs and cats, typically more often in summer and fall than during other seasons. Leptospirosis is found in the urban and rural areas of North America, Europe, and Asia, including China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, and Uganda. Leptospirosis occurs year-round in the U.S. and in Brazil, but peaks during the summer and rainy season.","token_len":497,"entropy":[6.5574,5.8096,0.8374,2.7325,9.4635,11.7676,6.9348,6.0941,5.9793,2.1293,4.9666,2.3491,12.2634,0.4452,2.4674,0.3358,0.4907,4.5302,1.8649,7.0175,1.1285,0.6621,2.117,2.8919,1.5761,2.9188,3.0786,3.0684,3.3855,1.5105,1.4506,4.8615,0.2314,4.3172,0.181,2.9687,0.7594,2.9431,3.0213,0.0645,0.8216,4.415,1.8806,1.1991,2.6949,7.7981,0.5267,1.2191,14.6395,5.7269,3.0141,1.0162,0.0151,1.6535,1.128,4.4926,3.6609,2.3064,3.3721,0.7604,0.6579,1.785,1.9488,2.7957,0.1312,5.082,0.931,2.916,4.7334,0.4897,3.0227,3.3421,0.029,0.1714,4.1059,0.8836,1.8651,5.2129,1.5908,0.0027,0.0231,1.582,4.5956,4.5289,0.0259,2.6248,0.5323,2.2105,5.5931,0.5842,1.7768,5.6744,3.4698,0.0015,0.0031,1.849,4.7519,2.4151,5.1694,2.4685,1.3263,1.0263,5.1324,4.3412,9.1037,0.0282,5.6333,0.136,2.2069,4.6509,4.1211,1.7584,1.7085,0.7162,2.8616,1.2247,0.8346,2.0471,2.8092,1.8707,1.2344,2.6373,1.3866,1.1803,0.1119,2.4782,4.3289,0.4633,2.0362,3.2516,2.9549,8.3864,3.4841,4.4407,6.3251,0.4535,0.0042,0.9509,0.221,6.0653,4.5423,2.0631,6.5675,2.132,3.2072,0.4627,1.6893,3.3109,1.5554,0.8789,3.2147,0.0936,2.3169,2.4266,3.742,1.0489,3.0739,4.813,0.6399,10.3798,0.0287,0.127,3.1285,0.1239,1.019,5.5848,0.0511,0.1732,2.1759,4.5894,8.6739,0.3545,1.3802,0.5228,4.5289,3.4366,2.1683,5.7754,1.8617,1.9513,5.5785,0.2387,0.5294,0.2893,4.7495,0.07,0.479,6.2928,0.4329,5.2576,2.915,0.6405,2.3227,3.1577,6.252,3.5423,2.9188,3.2966,0.0012,3.8346,0.3916,0.2307,3.4937,3.9353,0.3802,1.9981,6.0248,7.4175,0.0791,2.4133,2.2006,5.9325,6.062,3.7421,2.0148,6.6124,0.6026,4.0037,0.1348,5.512,1.3626,4.6732,5.3795,0.5393,3.0004,0.2792,0.8023,3.3388,4.0509,0.0024,0.0024,0.2441,3.3443,0.138,3.0901,0.366,4.5322,0.8654,0.222,6.547,2.031,0.9436,1.3253,0.4169,3.3809,0.3596,0.1665,4.9491,1.4848,7.5942,0.819,1.4376,5.6935,0.0051,2.1654,6.0773,0.4562,0.0468,0.9141,1.9729,0.0033,0.0003,0.0414,0.0003,0.4183,2.0296,0.2031,1.8986,0.0475,2.4597,6.686,0.3529,0.0673,0.111,4.8337,0.1485,5.0076,0.0932,4.9537,0.0606,1.8512,2.77,0.1541,6.6596,1.3838,4.5672,1.124,1.6212,1.5663,0.3299,7.4569,0.0705,0.0199,0.344,5.6604,0.0536,0.1847,0.0711,5.653,0.3893,0.0935,1.1439,6.7402,0.3327,5.0772,1.9691,5.3219,8.8429,4.564,2.9066,0.0397,5.4862,1.0268,2.7818,3.9331,3.5699,0.9333,2.2373,3.1482,3.0483,0.0802,4.1373,0.1057,1.5505,1.6249,4.9828,3.1297,0.4887,3.2613,6.9855,0.026,3.079,5.3428,1.7902,0.0518,3.8184,3.2305,3.2698,2.3489,0.3284,0.0982,7.745,0.3343,3.2813,2.356,2.7068,3.273,1.7287,3.0115,8.4765,4.2633,4.402,1.1685,0.0662,4.7396,5.0356,2.6124,5.191,0.0091,7.7511,2.7256,3.3016,5.56,2.7075,4.6663,1.4934,8.8428,1.1741,1.7866,5.59,6.836,3.5784,0.4837,5.1628,0.0063,0.219,1.975,1.7867,3.9546,2.4926,1.7232,3.6857,1.7274,1.3096,0.055,0.0007,0.0227,0.0033,0.2586,3.958,2.1166,2.7952,5.4761,6.4918,5.6488,1.8264,4.3054,1.6244,6.7773,5.5371,3.5804,1.6351,1.832,1.139,4.0547,0.7356,0.0397,2.0026,6.024,7.1652,4.0651,1.4286,8.3473,1.7159,2.1004,2.1174,2.6712,4.7301,0.3265,0.5929,2.6009,0.0056,0.0011,0.0783,0.0032,0.9109,5.4313,0.449,2.2006,7.6439,2.0481,0.9151,0.2918,0.5759,3.2442,0.0771,0.9131,1.4398,0.0821,0.7558,0.5297,1.5551,3.9966,2.9362,0.6344,1.2265,0.0496,3.0574,0.0433,4.1101,0.0514,2.1589,0.0625,6.5622,0.0456,7.2484,0.0462,4.3601,0.0505,2.9624,0.2926,0.0821,6.2843,0.0009,0.0626,0.4932,4.4432,0.1441,2.5695,0.0016,0.0009,0.0706,0.0013,3.0858,7.3254,0.6749,0.0055,0.7337,2.1339,3.0487,0.0013,0.0042,1.0679,0.5965,2.2418,6.1604,1.0252,2.4586,9.3483,2.3073,0.7646,2.0195,1.6432,9.337,0.2243,0.7121]}

Emily moved northeast, crossing the island the next day, but measured winds were below tropical storm force. The lowest pressures of the storm were over Saint Croix, the largest island of the U.S. Virgin Islands, on September 2, when Emily had winds of just 31 mph. It moved slowly towards North Carolina, but made a brief landfall on St. Thomas on September 4 with winds of just 43 mph. While Emily weakened over the Carolinas, high pressure gradually lifted off southern regions of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Around mid-november, Emily dissipated over Bermuda.\nOceanographic conditions that could cause a storm to form prior to any particular hurricane season are known as the \" early onset \" of hurricanes. Hurricanes in the Atlantic typically form later, however, in late June or early July. This has been attributed by some meteorologists to the influence of the Bermuda high off the northeast Florida coast. As a high pressure system develops in the Gulf of Mexico the Bermuda high is disrupted, and a low pressure system forms with resultant troughs and cyclonic storm tracks near the surface. An example of this is a low pressure system near the Florida Keys from June 2, 2003, to June 12, 2003, when it caused the early forming tropical lows between Sanibel Island and Key West.\nThe early onset of the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean is one of the most consistent features among global seasonal forecast models and is an important feature of future climate change research. Researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have developed an algorithm to determine whether hurricanes are likely to form earlier or later, based on statistical relationships between various environmental and atmospheric variables that play a role in storm development. The algorithm, now in its second year, predicts whether storms will form well before the usual onset or well after it, and is included as part of a set of tools for testing a variety of scenarios of future atmospheric conditions and climatic variability. For example, climate models predict a continued expansion and intensification of the Atlantic stormtrack under scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions, which would result in earlier mean storm onset and increased potential for the frequency of extreme storms and damage. For this and other reasons, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in collaboration with the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) Office to Combat Desertification and Drought (ECD) conducts seasonal forecasts and climate change projects in the Atlantic Ocean.","token_len":499,"entropy":[7.5319,3.3731,0.45,4.1861,11.7758,4.4208,0.0146,0.4951,7.1058,5.73,0.2817,7.4865,9.5769,0.0403,5.6141,1.1456,3.298,3.5257,2.9653,2.8492,6.7329,0.4671,5.4759,6.9746,1.4729,0.1387,1.478,3.6599,8.853,5.465,5.3832,4.437,7.2796,1.1462,2.5,0.8547,2.0208,7.9065,9.7305,2.9142,0.7589,0.5561,0.9185,5.0093,11.2824,4.4434,0.001,0.9938,2.9996,3.1411,1.8039,2.9045,1.0876,4.7925,0.0031,0.0295,1.0077,1.9572,0.003,0.9741,3.7313,0.7604,2.2451,1.457,2.9194,1.3338,5.1212,5.6059,0.4501,4.8302,6.7392,0.9721,0.6457,3.9657,3.2006,4.654,4.9326,5.6911,0.2951,1.2965,2.3676,4.9739,2.602,4.022,1.4192,1.6183,6.4334,0.0651,4.1063,1.8,0.254,1.6408,4.688,1.3018,0.2727,2.3126,4.6548,0.056,0.2404,5.6202,1.0449,6.1506,3.8207,1.037,5.9846,0.0,0.6585,7.1353,2.113,6.5307,3.0754,3.3721,6.7232,6.3091,0.6365,0.6208,6.1234,2.9034,1.7013,0.8971,6.5209,3.3363,0.1186,8.9504,9.4826,0.3851,0.7921,7.6083,0.0015,2.8267,4.6902,1.9853,1.1196,14.6538,3.0319,3.8379,5.5525,3.7612,2.2897,2.0393,2.2673,1.3423,3.3111,8.3409,0.006,6.785,5.6461,2.8732,1.3457,1.4377,4.2168,2.1712,2.705,1.5661,12.1903,4.5179,2.2893,2.2153,2.2811,0.4932,6.2029,3.6541,0.856,2.6806,3.271,1.528,6.5364,3.5425,6.1336,0.236,2.9226,3.1105,3.6419,1.0901,0.673,0.0428,0.8046,3.0907,5.1543,1.6131,4.8226,4.1843,1.3532,5.0749,0.0424,0.1601,1.0109,5.0381,0.0055,2.0205,6.7008,5.1926,9.6479,0.4779,4.6736,6.5851,0.2334,0.6431,4.1634,1.6341,7.8439,3.0993,1.5544,2.6824,2.1197,0.4527,3.0911,0.2512,0.0533,5.5237,5.9496,0.586,2.7569,8.0147,1.6572,2.1267,3.1167,3.4777,0.2438,0.0804,3.3953,4.9627,8.7471,5.9171,0.1035,2.1473,6.7187,3.9691,3.9783,5.4019,5.6302,0.6191,5.0682,0.5397,5.5362,3.5286,0.1878,0.942,1.5848,2.8853,4.0965,0.2855,0.4643,3.272,0.8517,3.9927,0.8257,5.5947,3.6976,4.3892,2.5141,3.8957,1.5508,0.8183,2.1148,3.9639,0.0202,2.6847,1.1954,1.44,3.4244,4.6808,2.95,6.6546,8.3321,7.8914,9.7066,6.4527,5.5537,7.0062,3.1708,0.2603,5.6525,0.083,0.8952,1.3822,2.058,3.568,0.7928,0.8777,4.1475,2.2901,0.2558,2.8618,0.6509,1.5635,3.5246,0.8039,4.4571,0.2347,0.2344,1.0097,6.1492,2.6647,6.0333,5.3273,8.1819,8.4174,0.9738,3.0947,2.0205,4.5162,0.6055,4.0654,0.459,4.5003,2.5425,1.3282,4.996,0.1933,6.4324,3.5785,0.7016,1.745,1.6916,0.0141,0.0208,0.0064,2.4768,2.4952,2.6422,3.8164,1.1957,3.4667,3.3583,3.7557,1.7997,2.8867,0.1107,0.216,4.1983,2.2399,0.1424,2.7609,2.1855,0.0644,7.0013,4.873,0.4745,5.7749,5.3927,1.8786,2.7678,1.7528,3.7905,6.2272,0.3408,0.5352,0.057,4.3089,3.8175,0.3616,1.4904,1.5317,2.823,6.1919,2.2678,0.431,2.72,2.2001,0.4496,3.2674,4.0824,3.7466,1.178,0.2761,7.4636,0.6456,1.2682,8.1758,4.3163,3.4882,4.834,0.5642,4.3558,2.0489,2.2054,3.6234,7.365,2.5096,0.5035,0.0011,1.8972,4.8961,0.0147,5.3474,1.77,7.0198,4.4846,2.7436,0.0008,4.8607,3.5437,2.6141,5.2509,1.7148,2.7501,5.3122,0.2237,3.5273,0.3575,4.7981,1.2552,0.0108,4.5659,0.4674,1.5755,2.4111,7.5527,5.8442,4.1418,4.309,0.0042,0.2095,1.1108,1.8166,4.1588,12.7534,6.7367,6.6881,1.5993,4.9912,4.7342,0.2165,0.5378,1.403,2.8422,2.4376,2.6097,0.0046,7.9981,10.1696,4.2008,3.8485,1.5649,4.5114,4.6006,0.3269,3.4018,8.4469,0.4575,4.6542,1.8915,3.3554,7.9989,1.2215,4.5251,3.0015,4.9169,0.1215,1.9742,0.108,1.2498,4.5512,1.3329,0.4555,0.0023,0.0,0.0075,0.8226,0.0006,0.0001,0.0176,4.9778,4.246,0.001,0.7314,6.2224,6.6309,5.3779,1.6189,0.1847,0.4231,0.4378,0.2805,8.0513,6.7178,8.9575,6.2712,0.9929,1.6852,5.8836,0.026,1.4914,9.9509,2.7132,6.2898,5.7276,3.3886,2.9972,3.9557,2.5836,6.3252,2.4145,1.2423,1.1118,0.853,0.9741]}

All of these items led the National Hurricane Center to predict the formation of a tropical cyclone with winds of 100 m \/ s at 200 miles.\nOn September 16, a depression was first observed east of the Mexican Gulf coastline, with a barometric pressure of 955 mb.\nAs of 9 am, September 23, a tropical cyclone was predicted between the Gulf of Mexico and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec based on a depression with a barometric pressure of 990 mb located south of the Costa Rica-Mexico border. The center of the system was located in Mexico at coordinates 18.9 \u00b0 N, 91.4 \u00b0 W. The hurricane center moved to a position between Guatemala and Honduras. At this time, the storm had a maximum diameter (minimum barometric pressure at any point of the circulation) of 80 miles and a minimum pressure of 960 mb with winds of maximum sustained speed of up to 75 m per hour.\nAbout the same time, the Weather Bureau, based on a reconnaissance flight from Mexico City, predicted the formation of a tropical cyclone between the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of California, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The storm had a maximum diameter of 60 miles, a minimum pressure of 970 mb, and winds in the range of 100-120 mph.\nFinally, on September 23, tropical storms Alison and Sandy began to intensify along the Pacific coast and their structures became more defined. As they moved more west, Sandy became a cyclone, but Alison did not maintain a cyclone. Then, September 24, the center of the storm began to move away from the coast, and Alison became a depression of 960 mb (the minimum pressure) with maximum winds of 75 m per hour. The Hurricane Center had reported that tropical cyclone Alison was located near the northwest corner of the Baja California peninsula (18.8 \u00b0 N, -113 \u00b0 W), so no special attention was directed to it. However, after the passage of Alison, the winds intensified, and the storm reached a maximum intensity of the typhoon wind scale, at which point it began to move west.","token_len":500,"entropy":[5.8096,8.5138,0.7286,7.1072,1.7436,10.4648,10.2882,0.5481,0.0197,3.9681,0.5821,2.3497,1.6639,4.6007,1.8126,4.4218,1.3632,0.5024,13.2877,14.2436,7.6339,3.6055,4.9378,3.1456,3.3807,0.5138,1.8859,7.8052,6.0029,5.5725,0.2713,1.644,3.4258,2.3061,7.8347,4.3328,0.3677,2.5884,0.2046,1.8487,2.8478,0.5209,5.121,1.5893,2.0572,3.6971,1.767,2.9945,0.2321,1.3731,2.4928,6.0038,4.7374,5.1813,2.8275,3.8599,6.5467,0.56,0.6125,0.43,6.3487,6.2448,2.5654,0.6187,5.1254,1.1942,1.7482,8.0745,4.1202,2.1703,7.0337,1.5598,0.0245,0.344,4.6247,2.5486,6.6918,0.0396,1.2027,1.5855,0.246,0.006,3.3107,3.7882,0.53,3.4174,6.1029,4.7405,2.5901,4.0202,7.1965,1.8451,2.513,1.4846,8.9705,0.6213,2.1801,0.1839,2.895,10.2492,2.8624,6.7479,1.9798,5.6065,0.0948,0.7497,5.2896,3.5758,7.3403,1.2537,2.7864,1.7044,8.1903,1.2205,0.3403,0.265,4.5783,4.5016,1.8696,6.7411,1.2449,3.5818,4.7581,1.7159,3.4921,4.6095,1.1716,4.7794,4.1676,0.5577,2.721,2.7416,0.2112,0.0068,1.427,2.9094,5.6559,1.2154,3.5961,0.4602,0.3058,0.1614,0.9158,7.1605,0.8387,0.0001,0.088,5.7444,0.3525,0.0203,0.0011,9.8097,0.077,1.7445,8.4534,4.2337,0.4697,1.7995,0.0077,0.0181,0.0555,1.6747,4.6739,0.0253,0.0336,6.9736,3.9006,0.1039,0.5253,7.3968,0.6012,3.0837,2.3776,0.0746,0.3927,1.7243,5.4864,1.4556,0.3968,5.3119,0.8033,2.2246,2.0132,4.4452,3.8356,8.4724,5.1728,1.805,3.1207,6.5652,2.866,0.8019,6.3712,0.3669,2.2115,0.0334,0.6209,1.5094,1.3928,4.8249,2.2101,5.8239,2.8972,2.3142,1.8564,4.1491,6.8443,0.2909,2.1384,1.9508,4.0597,2.7672,1.2098,0.3563,0.9048,4.339,3.0542,1.925,2.2007,5.0466,5.7074,7.2762,8.2463,0.0238,0.0938,4.3643,6.663,2.7047,2.2538,1.2102,8.0626,0.3995,0.1019,5.8224,3.1151,1.8767,0.8675,1.3109,3.8641,0.6679,6.6446,0.0679,0.0617,5.0846,3.58,0.2472,9.6252,3.8232,4.132,0.5133,4.222,0.0079,5.3386,3.0694,3.661,0.653,0.2804,1.0345,6.0903,2.8061,1.1943,0.0223,0.3659,1.3716,7.3601,2.4309,4.0098,3.8615,0.3799,1.9628,7.9681,4.1987,1.9354,4.2138,2.4676,0.4393,4.2171,1.6349,0.5855,0.0106,0.2963,0.3406,0.0632,0.0124,3.926,0.8022,3.0839,1.1665,2.766,5.6362,0.1143,3.4458,0.2534,0.1912,0.7641,3.7571,0.0286,0.0255,0.0515,0.2599,0.0044,0.0183,0.0,0.6599,1.1483,3.3869,2.6763,0.121,0.3132,1.1363,0.9325,3.3498,0.0512,2.1717,1.2788,0.6484,0.6187,0.102,4.9641,0.016,0.0055,0.736,0.3504,3.0877,5.4291,1.5489,2.1195,0.0542,2.7408,3.3766,3.0151,2.2885,0.3763,1.0937,6.6026,0.0964,0.6841,0.2819,2.266,0.1372,5.9682,2.9028,16.9756,0.8943,6.2606,3.6389,0.7109,5.7505,4.5348,0.2047,2.4548,1.157,2.6601,5.9854,7.863,3.3473,2.1211,8.1073,0.868,3.804,3.3932,1.5399,5.1663,4.481,2.2652,5.116,3.4423,2.6994,5.0063,0.067,2.2703,3.0767,5.93,4.0118,0.0537,6.9325,1.1858,3.821,0.0962,1.7656,6.3714,1.1413,6.0632,1.137,0.2417,1.508,3.832,0.1767,0.1942,2.1771,2.6376,0.1813,1.4809,4.9027,0.092,0.4393,1.823,2.1017,1.1111,5.7673,3.0669,0.2492,6.143,4.3893,6.3652,0.0753,0.0049,4.2557,3.3677,2.2047,1.8172,2.6975,0.984,4.6427,1.8945,0.1654,4.2561,0.4468,0.5439,0.0036,0.2161,1.9385,6.2605,0.1368,4.2242,4.4785,1.6596,5.2379,0.6036,1.9041,3.6194,1.3173,4.2761,2.8029,0.5309,5.207,1.3085,0.0165,0.3769,7.0956,0.3817,0.2278,1.4726,3.9322,5.579,0.909,2.4795,0.6165,0.1653,0.4089,7.5868,8.2906,0.5935,0.0412,1.6844,5.0639,5.928,6.9171,5.2275,0.1555,4.8044,0.4359,2.1487,0.5405,3.4575,0.0062,3.97,1.4816,7.0968,0.0651,9.423,0.8455,0.6401,5.7,4.1414,1.694,0.6995,1.1391,3.1662,5.4262,1.087,1.1748,5.3714,0.2068,6.4415,5.5571,0.0825,8.1161,9.1835,3.0929,3.2872,3.3467,0.7556,0.9757,2.5428,0.2543,1.4432,1.7467,2.3782]}

Her keel was laid down by the U-Boat Works in Bremerhaven on 1 May 1940. The first was launched on the morning of 28 July 1940.\nThe submarine was initially commissioned on 21 August 1940 by Admiral Franz von Hipper. On 23 August 1940, she participated in Operation Cygnet, the invasion of southern France, along with Deutschland's sister Deutschland 2 and Deutschland 3. During this operation, she sank two merchant ships and torpedoed an unidentified ship. With her sister ship, her mission in Operation Cygnet ended on 17 September 1940, when she sank a small landing craft in the Bay of Biscay on 15 September 1940.\nOn 28 October 1940, Operation Todt began, when she joined in sinking a troop vessel and a troop carrier in the Bay of Biscay, as well as the cargo ship Erster Schuh. She also torpedoed a shipping vessel in the English Channel and sank an ocean liner in the Adriatic Sea.\nWhen the German Navy was ordered to leave Norway on 15 April 1941 after the Luftwaffe launched Operation Weser\u00fcbung, the U-29 was used to bring supplies to Norway from the Baltic Sea. She was ordered to continue to Norway until 11 May 1941, although the crew saw it as a matter of great concern that the Germans would only use her for strategic needs. Despite this, U-29 was still permitted to carry one torpedo, but not any ammunition.\nWhen Hitler decided to launch Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the U-29 was ordered to join the rest of her fleet in the Kiel Strait, where a plan called Operation Weser\u00fcbung II was to take place. The fleet was ordered to sail to the Soviet Union, to the Far East and to Japan. The Operation Weser\u00fcbung II plan was dropped after the first day. However, the U-29 did not end her tour of duty in Norway. On 7 September 1941, the U-29 left Bergen, Norway and continued her search for a Russian merchant vessel in the Barents Sea.

PaRappa the Rapper creator Masaya Matsuura stated that the first game would have been called Rock Band. Matsuura had even prepared to make an update that would include Guitar Hero 3, but Nintendo did not like the title of the game. In response to that, Nintendo announced a single title for Guitar Hero, which was first to adopt online play. Nintendo was originally going to release the game in January 2004, but it was pushed back from December.\nGuitar Hero World Tour is the twenty-ninth installment of the video game series Guitar Hero. In the United States, the game was released on March 12, 2012 and in Europe on May 6, 2012. It was released in Australia on June 16, 2012, the United Kingdom on December 18, 2012, and New Zealand on December 30, 2012.\nThe game features a new level in each of the four guitar styles, as well as five new modes of play:\nThe Grand Finale stage included in Guitar Hero 2 was also an optional Stage in Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock. Grand Finale Stage included:\nThe main mode of play for the game was the Guitar Hero Challenge mode. Mode also included a separate mode called Guitar Hero: On Tour, in which the player is allowed to play in a stage by performing songs in the mode rather than using music tracks.\nIn April 2012, Guitar Hero World Tour was announced to be the first installment to launch with a multiclass system and the ability for players to swap instruments at any time. The system allows players the ability to purchase their own Guitar Hero World Tour guitar and a matching Guitar Hero World Tour bass through the Nintendo Network.\nThe Guitar Hero Challenge and guitar-only modes will have an online capability that will allow players to perform and record performances.

Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved","text":"Vice @ - @ President Millard Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved Crittenden refused and was re-elected to the Senate. From there in the Senate, he continued to make his mark and be counted on behalf of the State of Delaware. In 1867 he was one of six Senators who supported Andrew Johnson over his opponent, Zachary Taylor, who sought a third term for President. Crittenden opposed the anti-slavery resolution that Johnson signed into law at the end of the Presidential election campaign. Although he did not speak for Delaware he supported Johnson for President. Crittenden then helped to draft the resolution that the United States formally recognized the Spanish\u2013American War as a war to preserve the territory in the United States of Puerto Rico. Crittenden was a member of the committee which proposed that President Grant's nomination to the Supreme Court of Justice be approved. The vote was divided in the Senate; after a strong debate the approval was given and Crittenden was one of the twenty-one Senators who signed the declaration. Crittenden continued as Speaker of the Senate until 1870, when William Henry Harrison became president. When he was approached to run for President again he accepted the position. In 1892 Crittenden led the House Republican Caucus in condemning President Benjamin Harrison for his appointments to the Supreme Court. After the election and the formation of his Republican party, Crittenden was again elected to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by the term of William Sherman, a Democrat from New Hampshire who had died in office, and served from 1893 to 1895. In 1894, Crittenden ran for the presidency. Crittenden won Delaware, with the election of Governor James S. Wilson to the vice presidency. Crittenden then led a powerful presidential campaign and won the Republican nomination to the 1880 Presidential election. He ran an aggressive program of economic expansion. After his defeat, Crittenden was again elected to the Senate representing Delaware. Crittenden died in Philadelphia, having resided a long time in the State of New York. Crittenden married Margaret H. Munger of Delaware on October 25, 1868. They had seven children, four sons and three daughters. After his death in 1896, his wife and family relocated to Wilmington, Delaware.","token_len":502,"entropy":[8.3173,7.7574,4.5182,8.3876,10.0743,1.8999,1.3815,0.2078,12.9386,0.7903,0.8074,2.4731,7.3158,10.7628,0.4999,0.8102,3.4913,7.206,12.6126,4.5331,0.0559,0.0005,2.6649,4.5918,0.2776,5.2138,0.0404,0.8561,9.6834,0.8385,2.6347,10.3223,2.4404,0.928,7.9985,1.3331,1.1848,1.2506,5.4049,6.2042,9.8584,9.0349,0.0182,0.0127,0.0005,5.8432,3.708,2.6023,3.793,0.4024,0.1173,1.9118,0.8593,3.0011,1.2603,5.2608,2.8371,5.7087,1.6445,2.968,1.5366,1.2637,3.3377,0.5752,4.8525,2.7542,1.9491,2.5138,5.3754,5.4922,1.2339,10.2735,0.0608,0.7637,5.3202,0.9268,4.9248,0.714,2.7432,2.8247,4.079,1.2382,1.1153,5.2568,0.02,4.8064,1.9422,2.0497,4.7532,6.4039,3.1648,5.148,3.4703,2.2241,1.1229,7.7459,0.1088,2.1806,1.594,1.8265,5.5802,3.0921,2.936,0.0559,2.5012,4.0491,0.4863,3.9716,0.0044,0.0014,0.0011,6.3184,1.7771,7.3351,0.081,3.708,0.0411,0.0004,3.7336,2.9947,1.9485,2.1062,1.9394,0.0145,4.0584,0.3324,2.076,0.0008,0.7166,6.7451,1.8461,2.5068,0.8349,4.921,1.305,2.2491,0.3315,5.9979,2.8595,9.0147,5.4038,3.7372,1.8678,2.7614,1.1462,1.0077,2.9376,0.0057,0.0009,0.0013,4.3176,5.4741,2.1858,4.2116,0.6862,4.9831,1.3979,3.5317,3.2501,0.0089,7.6131,1.4756,1.7503,6.1675,7.0386,0.5641,0.1514,2.2402,1.1073,1.1153,4.5411,5.7143,1.0328,4.2356,3.4255,1.3307,1.6543,0.0064,1.6688,9.787,0.0057,0.6336,3.0351,0.0055,0.0007,0.0015,1.6956,2.2397,2.1527,0.0093,0.1792,4.5197,3.382,4.8212,2.9076,3.9933,4.2334,4.1317,4.6428,2.0169,0.5173,1.4671,0.009,2.0684,5.6123,1.0354,4.0445,2.2279,2.6055,4.061,0.9044,6.0411,2.7336,1.4369,0.6658,5.1435,5.2492,2.4636,5.2161,4.4061,2.6935,8.1925,0.2342,3.7833,3.3431,1.8332,0.0076,0.0007,0.0007,1.2202,5.4973,0.0544,0.9552,4.7777,0.9631,2.4086,0.7266,0.6601,4.0302,0.6893,5.2656,0.8693,2.5816,0.0102,0.0008,0.0021,3.8978,3.4465,6.9858,0.4553,0.0115,1.8619,1.2025,5.5505,1.4288,0.2073,8.2793,4.3478,1.555,2.9674,3.6317,0.7969,4.3275,2.3511,1.5989,8.0916,2.7871,2.5626,0.2663,1.337,4.4358,1.8536,3.6824,1.6251,1.4029,1.4755,1.7829,0.7752,4.0924,1.2906,0.0095,0.001,0.0021,4.4719,0.5474,4.9096,3.9382,2.9684,2.803,6.2672,3.0347,5.8949,0.4851,1.8777,1.7458,8.0527,0.7835,0.2467,0.8615,0.0055,1.149,3.5043,2.0121,1.8378,5.7536,1.5777,4.4543,0.0052,3.9839,3.8446,2.4879,0.6903,0.4551,0.0075,0.0011,0.0017,1.8017,4.9445,1.9697,0.7884,0.2719,2.9305,0.0081,0.5833,5.6384,3.6885,0.5093,1.3339,1.6478,0.2334,1.2585,7.1594,0.5219,4.9644,6.7306,3.2888,2.7958,2.1848,3.0795,2.3566,3.4392,1.9438,0.8514,4.3029,0.6953,2.3354,4.2494,2.0602,4.7672,3.2779,4.8759,0.4504,3.1695,0.1945,1.5851,2.4097,0.5631,2.8859,0.7004,0.0087,0.0011,0.0018,4.2871,0.4899,1.3771,2.5217,3.1204,3.2186,0.0034,0.001,0.0029,3.9713,10.743,2.6402,4.5775,2.4803,4.3898,1.3057,3.9935,4.2693,4.8459,0.0998,5.9903,3.4303,0.896,7.3446,1.0736,0.7753,2.2419,0.0029,0.0007,0.0039,3.4789,3.1174,2.3419,5.2986,7.5479,0.3244,2.838,2.581,1.4416,3.6232,0.2709,2.8141,0.5327,11.7719,3.2676,0.4861,0.3745,1.9982,3.6879,4.8369,3.3292,6.7141,1.036,3.5168,4.1657,3.2453,4.4375,2.6381,1.927,1.5631,0.5969,0.0081,0.0015,0.0022,2.3436,5.3443,1.1434,0.7283,0.2813,1.6595,6.2531,1.0789,0.8969,3.332,0.0032,0.0007,0.0058,5.014,0.8436,3.792,1.9887,5.9153,7.9013,6.1907,3.0792,0.1735,0.549,1.5874,2.2957,0.7439,3.1127,0.8988,0.4128,3.4899,0.0064,0.0008,0.0134,5.3948,4.2322,4.6077,0.5937,8.2473,2.434,3.0167,3.4984,2.726,2.8261,3.3163,0.0348,0.9766,3.919,0.3861,2.0883,0.7722,3.9048,0.041,1.9156,3.528,2.364,0.6364,2.0481,0.0135,0.2782,4.9409,1.272,0.5888,1.7804,4.7843,0.5406,2.8907,1.7051,2.6609,4.7423,3.504,0.1779,4.3925,0.3382,0.8985,0.6475]}
{"prompt":"After news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945 , followed by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August , it was evident that Japanese control","text":"After news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, followed by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, it was evident that Japanese control of the Islands in a conventional military conflict was impossible. The Japanese Army had no desire to fight an all-out defensive struggle in Southeast Asia, and the Japanese were clearly no more than a fleeting force in the region. After only 6 months of fighting on the home front, military planners in Japan recognized they needed to defeat the Americans in the East before they were capable of waging a prolonged, conventional military campaign in Southeast Asia.\nWhile the first American planes landed on 6 December 1945 in Thailand, the first American ground troops arrived in Indochina on 18 January 1946, after Japanese control of the Japanese and French Allies was effectively withdrawn by the Japanese government. The Japanese military was underestimating American power and capacity and was quickly crushed and evacuated from Indochina in April 1946.\nMeanwhile, on 21 April, the British Foreign Secretary Maud Gonne asked Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto for an ultimatum. Yamamoto replied that the British had asked him for an ultimatum when they wanted a declaration at this point, but they had not asked him for an ultimatum when they wanted a declaration in the past. It was clearly implied that Britain's ultimatum was merely a way to delay the surrender and that Japan wanted to surrender in an ultimatum. However, Yamamoto knew better: because the Allies had failed to gain any control over Japan in the previous six months, the Japan's economy was in disarray and thus incapable of defending itself for another day if the Allies pressed for a formal declaration. The Japanese needed some good reason why they should take the offer to surrender in an ultimatum. They hoped to gain some type of military advantage over America by declaring war so fast. To gain this advantage, they needed to delay the surrender and force an Allied victory in Southeast Asia, preferably by the early summer of 1946.\nOn 1 March 1946, Yamamoto declared war by writing a letter to Admiral Chester Nimitz. The Japanese surrendered to American forces on 1 July 1946 after suffering devastating bombings and an attack by Chinese troops on the island of Iwo Jima.\n\nVietnam War\n\nA week after the Japanese announced their surrender it was announced that the United States had launched its first airstrike targeting military targets in Southeast Asia, specifically the Japanese military base at Danang, Vietnam.","token_len":502,"entropy":[7.6704,0.5588,1.0442,10.4525,2.6258,2.3208,0.1707,0.0717,0.0002,0.0003,3.3431,1.5773,14.1302,1.78,4.5206,2.7405,0.7707,0.1367,8.9509,0.2261,0.9833,8.709,0.4572,11.3518,0.9229,1.8305,3.9154,0.6404,0.648,3.4739,0.6451,5.8602,0.2503,4.8526,5.1054,0.464,0.5719,6.9914,3.5159,5.2494,7.4154,3.1081,4.608,1.3081,4.3349,0.4428,1.8701,2.6156,4.0597,1.6783,2.786,5.665,0.2102,3.4874,4.1529,4.7804,0.1151,0.0329,7.5129,4.1974,2.7206,6.2081,0.0091,1.1749,1.0836,2.083,2.7386,2.911,4.9306,4.6,2.1795,2.1094,1.5989,8.6034,3.936,1.295,0.8399,3.0359,0.5205,5.16,6.0519,6.4205,0.4102,0.6175,2.8291,4.215,0.5236,8.221,0.3397,0.3685,6.5444,3.8216,2.8301,2.3818,4.942,5.5431,2.7768,0.5787,5.6933,0.4764,4.46,1.7463,1.4819,3.8259,7.4443,0.9631,3.6587,3.567,0.0021,4.2468,0.8304,4.8351,3.1295,4.5209,2.5084,0.654,1.3635,1.7139,0.0055,0.1906,1.5336,10.0828,0.9168,5.0508,3.9932,3.9962,2.9047,1.319,7.6482,4.6423,0.8633,2.5624,6.123,0.259,0.9457,2.9544,1.0985,4.5672,0.8484,1.6658,1.1055,4.8476,0.0267,0.0061,0.5232,3.9925,1.5034,0.6929,1.5806,3.5474,5.4325,4.9597,0.1767,0.5799,5.2825,7.4989,6.5093,9.7288,3.3456,4.3667,3.8725,2.2075,1.1116,3.6797,3.4156,0.6321,1.58,2.2528,2.4504,2.5571,12.2917,0.004,4.1003,3.5717,1.4062,5.3928,2.6976,2.585,5.5061,7.1514,3.9713,6.7852,2.5976,2.4775,0.0005,0.0037,2.7259,3.9157,0.8918,0.3815,1.8225,5.1724,0.1031,3.2968,3.8585,2.5294,1.5438,0.9184,3.8497,5.698,1.8002,8.1904,5.5409,8.3568,3.5894,5.8741,4.5623,7.3315,5.7832,2.3084,1.8991,0.7131,2.6493,2.8404,4.3979,0.0008,0.0001,2.3029,1.8678,0.0009,2.6484,0.4411,1.3032,2.2494,2.0144,5.3154,1.7747,2.4817,2.4183,0.8774,0.0011,0.0001,5.0525,1.4507,5.2472,2.8411,5.0629,6.9969,4.6802,2.1759,1.6124,1.1362,3.9599,1.3858,1.1989,3.7283,1.1493,0.964,1.021,0.0891,0.0008,0.0012,2.0606,0.4835,0.4858,1.2999,0.5249,2.49,1.7035,5.196,0.2624,4.162,0.5163,5.7113,7.3371,0.5793,5.66,2.8616,4.2394,0.0021,0.0193,0.9678,5.2874,0.9121,3.1975,0.7883,4.5765,0.9075,4.2003,3.5897,2.7132,3.1684,4.2766,0.8636,5.056,2.6722,4.2542,4.7789,0.0007,0.0171,1.2175,3.7991,0.0164,2.4872,0.0011,4.7508,4.8544,4.069,6.7267,1.6691,3.8006,1.069,5.2495,0.1658,4.3846,2.2893,3.7756,0.6681,3.6549,1.8236,0.8089,4.7809,2.9667,0.1807,0.2583,1.4892,6.5532,3.7418,6.4442,0.9084,1.7041,3.8702,0.116,0.7375,6.2913,7.494,0.005,5.3758,0.1794,6.095,3.3348,6.4804,5.6425,1.2778,1.4695,5.5538,1.1849,1.2819,4.2611,0.1265,0.8976,2.5381,1.7184,4.8179,5.3201,7.1396,2.1337,4.5166,0.8893,2.1402,4.712,1.7087,5.1018,3.3726,1.2923,1.871,2.2455,0.0632,0.0002,0.0101,1.0198,3.2766,6.0516,1.4716,2.1754,1.9244,6.5434,0.001,2.9347,0.4308,2.2598,4.7139,2.0278,5.4977,2.9916,7.1484,5.9905,3.3956,4.8984,3.0519,1.7463,0.4379,0.1956,1.3299,1.1766,0.4939,5.974,0.6348,0.9501,2.0657,3.821,3.3644,4.9403,3.0645,2.1091,2.3073,0.0058,2.4722,5.8823,1.419,3.1405,3.7123,2.0596,0.1328,0.3188,0.1627,0.6304,3.2032,3.3719,4.6014,0.9572,0.1722,2.8697,0.0021,4.7882,1.4998,5.2009,7.2215,1.3843,1.6118,0.1586,3.6093,7.1108,4.5998,0.0541,2.3696,1.5677,3.3369,5.2985,2.6479,2.5016,0.9012,1.1755,2.2788,3.9439,1.842,4.6343,6.9242,5.151,7.2056,1.5324,4.0975,2.8384,1.7119,5.0592,2.2909,0.6991,1.6994,2.8809,0.1296,5.6557,0.0899,0.0009,0.0005,0.8967,2.8194,8.1141,7.9434,1.7646,0.0522,3.1807,1.0779,0.0004,4.3061,3.7929,1.3153,0.4555,2.6151,5.196,0.526,1.4007,7.8558,0.519,1.4907,0.289,0.9914,1.5105,0.0508,1.6752,4.2073,2.511,0.7473,8.0428,6.7664,7.0385,0.6061,0.4863,2.7922,0.0142,2.0601,5.8668,1.5116,2.7193,2.3908,2.8237,0.4856,7.9642,0.8597,1.1192,3.9002,0.2934]}

{"prompt":"Antimony is in the nitrogen group ( group 15 ) and has an electronegativity of 2 @ . @ 05 . As expected from periodic trends , it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth","text":"Antimony is in the nitrogen group ( group 15 ) and has an electronegativity of 2 @. @ 05. As expected from periodic trends, it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth, but more electronegative than zinc.\nThe element antimony has several isotopes with mass numbers of 55, 57, and 61.\nThe heaviest isotopes are known to be stable.\nA compound of antimony and tellurium is a mixture of three solid phases of composition Sb 5 Te.\nIn some samples, the phases can be separated to greater than 99.5%.\nIn the simplest form, the composition is Sb 5 Te as shown in Fig.\nThe figure shows a solid solution with composition Sb.\nSb 5 Te crystallizes in the tetragonal ( space group P 2 1 3 ) structure.\nIn the literature, both the space groups P 2 1 4 and P 1 1 1 3 are commonly referred to as P 2 1 3.\nThe elements tellurium and carbon have similar electronegativities, 2 and the most stable tetragonal ( Pb ) structure is formed in the binary compound, Pb @ 5 @, @,.\nThe electronegativity difference between tellurium and carbon is much greater than the differences between the elements antimony and selenium, or tellurium and bismuth.\nThe stability of the tetragonal structure can be understood in terms of the bonding interactions.\nThe bonding interactions in tellurium are essentially two-fold.\nThe carbon atom can be viewed as an aromatic system having an lone pair of electrons.\nThe carbon atom participates in bonding with the selenium atoms through sigma bonds and in bonding with the tellurium atoms through pairs of orbitals.\nBecause of the electronegativity difference betwen tellurium and selenium, the energy is minimized by having two sets of bonding interactions.\nAt the higher electronegativity, the energy is minimized by reducing the number of bonding interactions to one set.\nThe reason for this is the greater stability of the trivalent selenium atom.\nThe presence of two sets of bonding interactions can also be understood from the viewpoint of electronegativity theory.\nThe selenium atom has an additional lone pair of electrons, which can be viewed as a charge that is approximately equal and opposite in sign to an ionic charge.","token_len":503,"entropy":[10.4733,2.5936,5.2567,1.5363,13.3167,6.5173,3.4255,12.8962,7.4089,1.5924,1.0409,3.996,3.0078,7.2665,2.1297,0.3014,2.2804,0.3603,2.9463,11.032,5.5629,8.8311,9.8062,1.4258,6.4407,4.1047,4.1122,8.38,8.3104,0.8608,2.9951,1.045,4.2486,4.9519,0.0246,0.0145,0.5483,0.6321,9.1795,4.5007,4.7148,2.7392,0.0017,1.7769,1.7349,3.6541,2.3917,0.0184,0.0281,0.0263,0.0893,3.605,0.8417,2.0208,5.8251,7.399,8.4984,0.0552,2.1102,4.9609,6.2692,0.6004,3.4998,7.803,5.7862,1.8271,6.988,1.8205,4.7429,0.2621,1.4683,2.7021,1.0778,2.9474,1.6509,6.4222,2.1369,0.9895,1.0605,5.7828,1.2392,0.9762,6.9968,3.262,1.7701,3.7115,6.8172,1.9083,2.1168,0.0045,3.7616,12.584,0.2865,0.4614,1.4073,2.7369,5.0429,0.1575,3.7302,6.2998,3.9549,2.5526,7.5387,6.9853,5.7163,5.1265,7.9457,3.6036,1.7592,3.7185,4.9437,4.9677,0.8365,1.3864,6.0796,3.8499,0.4953,3.3644,3.8971,9.8599,1.253,5.0563,1.0642,2.9503,1.7501,0.9839,2.6514,1.9035,6.1781,2.7444,0.5199,1.436,4.8197,1.7374,3.9734,0.1619,0.9154,0.3197,5.4542,2.4739,0.6977,1.6282,0.1446,5.8083,1.6514,7.771,0.8329,2.4849,4.3876,6.7352,2.8963,7.748,0.6814,0.1417,5.3096,0.9969,4.0687,0.1402,1.1861,0.116,6.442,0.3797,1.5578,1.742,6.9979,1.4287,1.0993,4.6818,9.7051,6.9192,6.0607,3.5041,6.4945,4.1995,0.8857,4.4321,1.4074,1.1311,2.7159,1.0717,8.7668,0.4268,5.953,2.5999,9.3846,2.7711,1.8769,0.3631,0.2131,4.9855,0.2617,0.1691,3.5497,2.4855,2.7802,1.8185,0.8792,4.6406,3.1128,0.0226,0.0838,4.7519,1.0223,1.4158,1.1363,2.5744,0.8921,1.342,7.1593,7.5876,0.0106,0.0019,0.7867,6.9699,2.4255,3.2326,7.3693,0.0282,8.0886,3.3009,1.6964,6.8388,2.8871,7.2382,5.7918,3.2185,6.7759,0.0106,0.0455,2.6464,2.8214,8.0772,4.1962,1.2603,1.2189,4.7529,2.3968,0.7711,8.941,7.0164,3.304,2.0476,0.6145,10.6116,2.9306,6.185,5.9477,6.7855,9.8371,0.7326,1.3182,6.6978,0.0195,0.2269,0.4473,6.8227,0.8841,9.3444,0.0017,0.0018,0.0618,1.21,0.4471,5.0983,1.7022,0.536,1.7787,4.1329,0.3686,2.0429,4.1161,3.4708,0.0205,0.1076,8.0434,0.0337,0.0652,1.9527,4.9097,6.4018,0.0022,0.0833,0.8239,5.3519,0.0149,0.001,0.5555,0.3934,1.2749,7.4962,0.3774,0.8136,2.874,0.0014,0.0338,0.8266,3.5268,0.1455,4.7802,1.9458,0.8223,0.0024,0.8713,7.0508,6.2223,2.4491,0.7513,1.305,3.7971,2.8347,3.9238,2.8009,0.0011,0.0015,1.6111,6.2803,4.2425,2.0349,2.8538,0.6325,1.0691,1.4433,5.3059,3.0609,3.708,0.7656,6.577,0.2605,2.5621,6.302,6.4846,5.8163,2.5879,13.3274,3.9655,0.2062,2.0079,1.4766,0.9473,0.8164,2.2093,0.5802,8.3508,0.1167,3.194,1.6523,1.293,5.4224,0.0083,0.0187,3.6538,5.0332,7.3656,2.9557,3.8101,2.7993,3.911,2.9691,0.214,0.6481,5.1909,0.0012,0.0028,0.4762,0.2887,6.87,0.1106,9.0453,0.6157,0.4493,0.2792,5.3026,1.3255,0.6032,6.3141,0.012,0.0937,0.0118,0.6103,9.7689,0.7935,4.7789,0.0029,0.0012,0.301,1.8129,0.0008,0.0006,0.2401,0.7978,6.4938,4.5617,7.5263,1.6685,4.2201,2.7349,5.947,0.0097,5.6333,2.3126,0.7094,0.2813,4.9906,0.9066,5.0864,5.9555,0.0153,0.0816,0.0616,1.3104,0.51,3.4477,0.9597,3.5244,0.3559,5.7367,0.1985,2.7138,0.0125,3.1827,0.3771,3.3394,1.2946,3.7079,0.7953,0.3702,1.2917,6.9959,0.8316,0.8369,0.6558,2.5402,5.8661,5.097,0.327,0.1295,7.3252,4.7698,0.2801,5.9693,0.0049,0.0231,2.3398,0.8352,0.3086,1.1267,6.3334,0.0232,2.858,3.6539,0.0251,0.4907,0.1901,2.7152,3.4581,1.3441,2.9227,3.6375,0.5848,9.8906,0.0258,6.2172,0.0196,0.1204,0.0197,7.0605,0.281,0.2389,1.3032,5.4677,0.0045,0.0047,0.6652,2.0233,2.0082,5.1149,10.9635,0.0839,0.248,0.1177,1.8945,1.7212,2.2673,0.8289,1.6997,0.0595,1.244,7.6135,4.7803,1.3962,9.8095,3.0196,6.9606,3.2512,4.1932,9.5454,0.7142,3.7878,2.3372,1.8543,1.2922,0.3555]}
{"prompt":"The main damage done by mole crickets is as a result of their burrowing activities . As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges ,","text":"The main damage done by mole crickets is as a result of their burrowing activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, which when overwintered act as weak points to the ground, which when overworked, can crack under the weight of heavy rain.\nThe following is a case study that has been reported recently in South Africa. A property owner approached a local property consultancy firm, to assess whether his property might be affected by mole crickets. The property was located in a rural area where there were no known mole cricket infestations and no similar cases have been reported in the area. The property owner had noticed a change in the ground level around a house, on the street side of the house, that was not present in the adjoining areas where there was no house present. A visual assessment of the ground was conducted and a further test with electric current was conducted and showed that a mole cricket was embedded in the earth. The consultancy firm then proceeded with a mole cricket treatment involving injection of anti-mole cricket bait into the cracks in the ground. The property owner reported following this treatment that the damage had stabilised and the problem was not appearing to be as bad as at the time of the appointment. The house was not affected by subsequent heavy rainfalls and there was no visual damage.\nBased on this case, it would appear that mole Cricket damage in rural areas is usually limited to properties that have seen heavy rain or where there has been a build up of moisture near the ground, such as in the presence of old buildings. In urban areas there is likely damage in the ground, regardless of the presence or absence of a building, but usually this damage will be limited to low lying areas in the vicinity of buildings.\nFor homeowners, mole cricket damage is largely avoidable and for those properties that have experienced damage the following strategies might reduce the impact of the damage: \u2022\tMake repairs to the house before severe weather starts \u2022\tMonitor your garden and property to identify any signs of mole cricket infestation \u2022\tIdentify if any of your neighbours have experienced mole cricket damage or if they have adopted mole cricket control measures.\nThe treatment of mole crickets will vary according to the severity of the problem and the age and general condition of the house. These factors will determine whether you will need to engage experienced mole cricket consultants (for advice) to design and implement the treatment. Treatment levels are summarised in Table 1.","token_len":504,"entropy":[6.6973,7.367,2.6006,1.4917,13.0291,8.9626,3.0271,0.8511,5.7934,1.7299,0.3123,0.0036,2.0509,5.5361,0.1606,7.1049,0.9959,3.97,2.2397,7.5955,1.5641,1.0199,7.627,9.0306,4.8178,0.2445,0.0091,0.2362,1.7541,2.0797,7.0012,2.7224,3.7596,2.1684,3.5089,7.1596,5.1994,0.0089,1.5338,2.1599,6.4891,10.2913,4.8755,0.0019,6.6649,0.1239,7.6057,3.6803,2.7035,2.4855,4.1547,2.8093,2.5019,5.6787,5.2444,5.5742,2.3007,1.9214,6.0491,4.6145,1.2133,1.2912,0.1496,5.6733,3.9066,0.5992,1.2801,8.2557,5.7688,2.247,0.7589,6.595,1.3905,4.5621,3.3764,0.9077,3.8168,5.4926,1.3795,4.0451,0.4606,1.0451,2.8667,10.4043,1.6224,6.7872,1.5431,3.2422,6.8174,7.7787,5.1179,2.3281,5.1774,3.8675,2.7176,3.7261,2.0275,3.3645,0.7352,2.1733,0.1472,1.3994,0.0641,0.0006,0.4441,1.0434,3.5137,2.0982,4.263,0.9715,1.1405,2.938,0.454,3.68,2.1862,1.2555,0.9067,4.9138,1.315,5.2578,3.0301,0.3696,0.0002,2.3762,1.6491,7.0331,4.1167,1.9638,0.1704,0.0849,1.674,1.2406,2.3114,0.5083,0.8204,3.2348,0.7093,2.8466,5.1887,1.5864,4.7603,0.1285,0.4169,3.624,3.2551,4.8957,3.2321,4.0887,2.6916,5.0304,1.4741,5.2014,5.0087,0.7498,0.3225,1.1571,0.7552,3.1991,1.6185,3.2763,3.7693,1.0227,0.5993,6.3876,4.5514,3.2325,2.4781,1.163,1.2877,6.0214,5.5247,0.5071,3.7716,9.7517,3.9181,0.5837,0.2007,1.1583,3.2635,2.8091,1.6557,2.6217,4.0126,5.3277,5.2207,7.7132,2.3205,0.4453,1.8833,3.8595,6.5027,0.8065,3.4276,0.4504,0.642,1.5187,4.8698,0.4695,0.187,4.9041,1.6927,0.996,9.3331,0.7986,2.9247,4.2517,2.74,1.937,8.0412,0.495,4.8333,7.2746,6.787,0.1297,6.9511,0.0618,1.5778,0.1718,1.4966,8.1404,1.4067,0.1563,7.4801,1.2842,0.0822,1.291,1.2745,0.9377,5.3706,0.6487,4.3922,7.9112,2.0096,1.6657,1.5868,1.179,5.6371,2.5923,9.1915,0.0068,0.9621,1.5509,4.8514,0.746,3.7354,7.8315,1.297,0.8045,4.8488,3.1394,0.1144,5.7428,1.073,0.5942,0.7398,0.742,6.9396,0.8116,1.4119,5.8773,0.9012,2.9365,1.0463,0.774,8.0637,8.4486,0.8927,6.1255,1.4808,3.1671,0.6252,0.1229,9.2354,2.2514,1.4323,1.3448,6.9418,0.0761,1.593,3.5853,1.0709,2.0041,3.7126,1.2031,0.1092,2.2292,6.947,6.2092,3.0276,5.9991,0.4611,0.8365,4.3899,2.8629,0.09,6.687,1.7541,1.2403,5.9994,3.5383,1.1362,3.4119,5.2545,1.6317,1.6301,0.0618,1.6417,6.8058,0.865,0.1225,4.9073,7.1691,0.6042,1.1361,3.0924,3.1112,0.0087,1.8552,1.5972,6.1453,0.0424,8.6655,2.9934,0.9781,2.4853,4.8733,0.0711,3.7156,0.8127,5.6459,8.3526,3.3938,1.4534,2.3836,3.3699,7.5703,0.068,1.1667,4.5681,1.7247,0.3011,0.0036,2.1777,3.6152,1.1301,2.0149,6.2955,3.7014,2.2712,3.1696,0.613,2.4297,0.099,4.8624,6.4047,1.0568,3.6208,1.7107,2.8516,0.1932,2.9594,0.9041,1.4568,4.7376,7.9547,1.8423,2.587,0.589,1.2074,0.8412,5.8049,7.5358,0.0042,2.2626,5.7623,2.4337,6.3625,0.8773,1.2247,2.1176,4.058,5.1787,4.2701,4.5681,3.612,6.8067,0.488,3.5245,0.8502,1.203,2.4098,1.3565,5.6937,20.7718,12.3402,6.0705,1.4218,0.8971,3.9657,3.5464,9.2128,2.7486,5.7186,1.5647,13.7274,8.635,5.3389,5.2708,1.6701,6.325,1.9027,5.1772,1.8842,3.4279,0.1278,2.3672,0.4676,3.8684,0.6281,1.581,14.3509,5.8015,0.0266,5.6977,2.0762,2.5267,1.8862,2.4496,0.6668,4.6882,2.2811,0.1551,0.4925,3.2004,0.815,1.5141,0.6045,7.9347,5.5247,0.2634,5.4815,1.2983,1.3095,1.04,2.5473,7.0007,1.323,0.4181,1.4826,0.0001,4.1542,2.4555,2.167,0.0054,0.4471,2.4973,0.1768,0.1684,1.8832,1.1058,1.3194,5.8904,2.3476,7.9994,1.8026,0.0464,0.0824,2.0419,0.4718,4.4491,2.6548,1.9751,2.2745,1.5196,2.2714,1.3196,2.3822,0.3473,6.0328,9.769,1.0213,0.4983,5.4837,5.0681,4.2333,5.8241,5.2431,1.3658,7.1145,1.1962,1.0328,1.628,0.7824,1.3104,7.3567,8.7398,2.2521,7.3744,0.0016,0.6606,1.3136,0.8576,0.8043]}

Severe flooding caused by Hurricane Tomas damaged 100\u2013120 housing units in Bluefield, Nicaragua, killing 25 people, one of which was confirmed to have died from drowning while trying to escape from the flood waters. Water flooded homes in many of the southern areas of San Juan del Sur, leaving 12 dead, and flooding and mudslides occurred in San Juan del Sur, where a two-story brick building collapsed, killing 5. It is reported that 7 houses collapsed in Bluefields, 5 died from landslides, and 5 people were killed by falling trees, both in the Bluefields and San Juan del Sur provinces. Rainfall also resulted in landslides and water logging in the El Rama, Nicaragua province. In Bluefields, heavy rains caused the closure of four toll bridges. An official reported that 10,000 people did not have drinking water and some residents did not have electricity. The flooding damaged many bridges and roads, which resulted in some schools being closed in Nicaragua. In some places, there were no roads for months. Electricity was cut off in many areas of Nicaragua on July 26\u201327. In some parts of Bluefields, no electricity had been supplied since October 2017. Also, flood waters blocked roads and the government was not able to repair some bridges, leaving thousands of people with no access to help.\nIn October 2018, a former NHC official at the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change, Michael Wilker, concluded that the storm had been underrated by the NHC and did not have the size reported.","token_len":504,"entropy":[7.612,3.3413,0.2198,3.9015,12.078,9.1101,8.729,1.4619,6.7169,0.0916,6.8443,1.9145,1.8898,5.1715,4.7617,3.7534,7.9192,3.0217,0.3559,0.7755,5.2753,1.822,5.1668,3.0128,8.2827,2.3146,2.2087,4.0471,0.0567,3.4637,0.4874,0.9716,6.6297,2.61,1.486,0.6571,0.4113,1.0707,0.0836,3.8865,4.1783,6.1233,3.6012,2.9628,6.6812,6.6248,2.2504,2.5776,3.4801,0.3506,3.527,1.0083,3.3754,0.0103,3.8744,2.2679,3.3469,0.6814,5.2248,7.5506,10.362,2.0781,9.7441,5.3434,0.5907,0.042,0.1451,6.9897,5.5949,4.0933,10.7862,1.6734,5.0797,3.611,0.8021,5.3933,10.7148,3.4973,3.1145,2.0072,4.3843,0.4489,0.3305,0.6661,4.1478,0.2765,1.3556,3.1165,1.7189,0.5161,5.8241,3.8773,3.84,3.05,0.2576,4.5063,0.6116,2.9337,3.8836,1.0373,1.8881,0.0152,9.7856,6.5299,2.1541,3.0551,4.6188,6.192,0.0144,0.0005,0.0815,3.032,1.8723,1.8765,1.083,0.3219,7.8093,2.4256,0.0374,2.1699,1.3672,0.1478,1.8721,0.1513,5.4197,6.0648,1.6586,3.3716,0.7869,0.8106,0.0061,3.9643,1.1383,4.2911,2.7069,4.3592,0.6161,0.1747,1.7338,2.1206,2.0138,0.5641,2.8331,0.7815,0.001,0.0002,0.0586,2.3418,1.3331,6.1928,3.7871,1.1586,3.9479,8.2319,0.5695,6.1021,0.6121,2.863,1.3241,3.0744,1.7238,0.9577,5.748,4.5036,5.3307,5.0704,2.0002,0.7369,1.8771,7.4415,7.9425,0.4776,2.8543,0.0082,1.3347,2.7678,5.2254,1.909,5.0897,2.1526,2.2626,2.1147,3.6889,4.0341,0.0013,1.2257,2.7471,0.0241,0.0026,3.4676,3.7367,1.5847,6.2922,0.0229,1.3516,1.9516,3.1679,3.0123,7.6303,6.4608,6.4605,9.0728,3.2421,5.8219,0.2977,1.5117,6.3752,3.6117,0.8933,4.7304,1.2079,5.09,5.214,0.5567,1.7232,5.2133,0.8684,3.047,0.299,6.9787,1.6893,1.829,0.9154,3.3905,2.9601,6.0101,3.4965,0.0035,1.9363,2.0558,0.6872,3.6892,2.6739,0.24,6.4045,4.101,3.4323,1.4394,5.3035,1.8406,0.211,6.4366,3.4377,0.5631,4.6809,0.24,0.0659,0.0058,0.9213,3.7114,5.7365,1.5803,1.5811,1.9821,4.8567,4.2971,2.4015,0.0162,0.0516,5.9844,0.8305,4.4722,1.0505,0.2238,0.2994,1.5433,3.8964,2.9006,6.5511,0.1355,0.9359,4.3634,0.8044,1.8734,2.4866,1.2492,5.2246,2.3038,3.9215,3.6431,4.9249,0.1692,6.4376,4.7437,3.4629,1.4517,3.6364,3.2076,1.1986,6.4588,4.6549,2.2075,4.4446,0.0085,0.7645,0.6752,2.6044,2.6452,0.5537,1.9724,1.5528,3.6957,2.4816,2.4356,6.2873,1.8162,1.2655,4.4566,0.1914,2.1158,2.4404,0.0456,0.0147,0.0039,6.3193,0.2544,7.7676,1.0259,4.1176,4.1292,0.107,2.242,0.0031,1.1384,3.8531,8.8867,1.6723,1.4445,7.4768,5.3936,6.6776,3.1942,4.7951,2.7429,0.9961,3.3989,4.8129,0.3186,0.1847,6.3069,1.216,1.4143,2.7104,5.4491,0.0268,4.4191,10.2527,2.0086,2.2307,5.4639,3.899,4.7928,0.422,4.1296,2.0204,0.2329,0.7616,6.6109,0.0262,1.4822,7.3205,0.0064,2.6469,4.1521,3.6304,3.3828,0.0257,0.5315,2.5314,0.5167,2.0949,4.184,4.5374,3.082,4.042,1.2442,3.3467,1.4132,3.6378,2.9663,0.0049,4.2375,5.767,1.2128,0.8985,3.4784,6.2287,0.6174,2.795,4.4051,2.49,0.3028,3.3717,0.3956,2.4924,2.3293,3.0762,7.1696,1.0458,6.5178,1.2398,2.1334,0.6968,1.0228,1.709,1.0784,1.9582,2.0654,5.5648,0.551,1.5586,5.508,0.5369,1.0871,2.96,2.1892,2.6163,0.1889,3.1421,0.0617,0.1545,4.8494,0.7349,4.2797,0.0999,4.6097,3.0217,3.3293,6.3296,0.482,6.4147,0.4723,6.6555,2.0844,4.9143,1.1717,1.114,4.2316,4.914,3.2317,3.2503,0.2325,0.0026,4.1714,5.0621,2.9288,2.5495,3.7613,3.4028,0.7155,0.4326,3.5959,1.224,1.6069,0.1031,6.7553,0.4753,1.0167,14.3695,4.5509,4.4735,0.113,2.1023,7.8132,5.7135,0.0135,1.669,5.8992,0.6311,5.1183,0.3463,3.992,0.5428,2.227,2.5072,0.1782,3.1757,4.8683,0.6779,2.7208,5.1066,6.5585,5.9202,0.2792,6.2846,0.2687,1.2655,2.7626,2.1613,3.3926,11.9009,2.1587,1.3195,5.4735,0.0073,2.1322,4.9356,0.0285,1.6623,1.9644,6.5563,9.6943,1.9356]}

Daydream, a single entitled, \" Dream Away, \" and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album of 1995.\nAlthough the album had not received much exposure, Daydream was a number one best selling album on the charts, and is still currently topping the Billboard charts, which shows just how dominant the album was to its fans.\nDaydream was a number one album that sold million copies in 1995, which is a lot of music that you can not get enough of. Daydream sold over 9 million copies just from the United States.\nDaydream was also very successful in Europe, where it became a gold single, and later on, was nominated in a category for Best Song, by the Grammys.\nThe album was a little different from what many people expected, because it was not a pop album, it actually was one of the most danceable and most fun of albums around. Daydream was also extremely successful in Africa, and even in Korea.\nIn conclusion, Daydream was such a big hit for J-Lo and the record company, that Daydream was re-released in 1998, for J-Lo to perform for the Grammy Awards, and that album was also a huge success.\nJ-Lo has many talented songs from the classic days, like \" Get Right, \" to many of the current songs she's making now, like \" Love You Like A Love Song, \" that have been hits over the world, and she is very successful at it.\nJ-Lo is still one of the most talented singers, and has received many awards, including two Grammy Awards, and her voice is truly amazing.\nJ-Lo is an excellent performer, and has many talented songs that will truly amaze you, and she hasn't had quite as many hits as some other artists of the 90s, but she's not afraid to keep trying.\nA lot of the hits that she's had today are not as old as the days of the classic hits, but they are still very good and have been a lot of fun for many people.\nI hope that someday soon, J-Lo will release more classic albums, because she's such a talented singer, that she will continue to be very successful and famous for many years to come.","token_len":505,"entropy":[10.772,5.2186,8.8092,1.3158,0.2734,3.9918,0.0478,0.1688,1.9714,9.6677,10.7011,4.5272,10.9817,5.4725,2.3687,7.4801,4.234,0.788,7.7353,0.9852,6.0607,2.5977,7.2783,2.5513,4.8089,1.0955,1.2453,0.8645,5.6913,9.0447,0.0005,1.3496,2.1397,0.4185,5.3551,3.62,1.4017,0.4851,4.3569,1.2993,4.8614,5.3413,7.2888,3.5368,0.0002,3.9298,3.495,4.7841,8.2861,2.5708,1.7449,9.4302,7.1275,4.4251,1.6061,4.5799,5.2105,3.0508,0.1438,3.8982,3.8467,5.076,0.0185,1.7067,3.023,0.9932,1.8855,1.9368,11.0509,2.0033,1.9416,3.64,3.6083,2.8809,2.0563,5.4387,1.0762,2.0305,0.0001,1.4023,2.4384,6.4143,0.2245,4.0499,0.6727,0.8441,3.0696,0.8211,4.0069,2.1557,1.3155,4.5667,1.9287,6.548,6.5747,0.6593,1.7942,1.334,2.9134,4.2072,4.4708,4.5149,0.0415,6.0481,1.3899,2.1428,1.1618,5.2632,2.7494,3.8993,0.4103,1.3045,1.0879,0.0002,1.4053,3.0721,4.3115,0.1535,3.5259,3.5045,2.4332,7.0466,0.2465,1.7649,3.1038,1.0588,2.7952,1.461,2.1202,3.0348,1.0447,5.5327,2.4537,3.8909,1.9231,5.6314,1.7608,2.9603,0.0573,0.6331,2.566,0.0001,2.6254,0.9131,4.038,0.461,0.2538,6.8548,3.4186,1.4513,6.3937,0.0644,2.2328,1.4812,0.9886,0.0003,1.0596,1.5459,4.3119,1.8465,1.2477,1.5223,0.8798,1.4144,0.7727,2.8104,1.5698,7.9785,9.7567,1.9758,1.3604,4.9958,3.1603,1.8472,2.9767,2.0368,4.6266,2.7044,6.3126,1.6352,0.2958,4.9556,2.7177,5.8023,1.6315,5.1103,0.0269,0.8008,0.8549,3.1005,1.9203,1.2281,3.0213,6.6775,2.7104,0.9265,3.1495,2.7521,1.7788,1.9966,1.0997,2.3348,1.1106,0.7629,2.7119,1.3398,3.7128,2.0572,1.2615,1.7058,6.9664,1.0468,4.6587,0.325,0.4506,1.4625,7.2167,1.0844,2.1973,4.2915,4.406,4.0944,4.9356,5.0058,0.3461,2.4211,0.0001,1.0013,2.1444,4.7326,2.6195,0.4583,5.4962,0.4233,2.7448,3.4466,2.4151,4.6328,1.3555,0.7305,3.565,5.6468,0.2062,0.9976,0.0001,0.9057,5.5612,0.207,3.1527,0.5948,3.3315,7.168,1.8199,4.529,1.8813,2.5086,7.1673,1.7171,1.1084,0.8202,3.6708,0.0002,1.3068,5.1759,0.6196,0.1534,1.3724,3.8001,1.7052,4.4509,7.0803,0.1612,0.011,2.5765,4.9826,4.0472,1.315,4.3048,0.4086,1.4166,0.6286,4.1329,3.536,1.0123,2.3574,2.5367,2.1086,1.2457,1.1143,0.6882,4.1288,0.1537,0.0027,3.9371,5.2105,6.9494,4.8402,3.5938,2.2331,5.6128,2.9074,1.0908,2.0587,0.4639,8.4242,6.1144,4.148,2.4158,6.0283,5.4777,1.7945,1.1288,4.5548,3.0687,8.2638,1.5542,4.3157,2.8497,1.2946,0.9562,0.1847,5.2534,3.1364,3.9812,2.6809,5.1094,0.6544,2.8737,0.1324,5.1315,2.9283,1.3705,7.7665,4.228,0.2946,8.0394,1.6302,1.3943,2.817,2.8303,2.9498,3.429,3.2815,2.2227,0.4267,0.7926,2.7204,0.0295,0.0052,1.8334,3.0745,2.8918,0.01,0.1648,0.81,3.1649,2.4059,2.8226,0.7579,3.0195,5.7882,1.5395,0.746,1.5053,1.2346,4.6754,2.0699,0.991,1.0955,1.5312,4.4233,4.905,1.1002,5.6788,2.2344,0.531,0.7638,2.154,0.0369,0.0057,1.3342,3.4952,3.8437,3.815,0.5312,0.5916,2.316,3.2055,4.0308,1.7352,1.7944,3.4065,6.1374,7.7548,0.0095,0.8466,1.5927,1.3458,2.0213,7.0321,0.0007,2.6088,6.0157,1.25,1.1253,2.275,0.6248,2.086,2.0279,2.1784,3.4004,0.9669,3.5389,0.8738,0.927,1.376,0.7734,2.839,4.0787,3.1552,0.1604,5.3384,3.9152,1.1338,0.5267,4.8579,2.0488,0.0846,2.0708,5.3242,1.5154,1.6887,1.3519,2.9539,5.7431,1.0028,3.3686,2.0205,6.8438,0.2981,2.1766,2.8978,0.9846,1.7729,4.2716,4.311,0.4973,1.057,1.5073,1.0879,0.9186,1.7194,1.4847,2.6468,2.9345,1.6812,2.9844,3.2779,0.2041,1.2039,1.8557,1.8341,1.431,0.8373,0.5606,3.6562,2.8367,0.9192,5.288,4.6098,1.0532,2.4449,0.0061,0.0035,0.3145,4.0537,2.7289,4.5238,2.8828,1.1148,2.8495,1.8735,1.5039,1.8594,0.2993,2.9753,0.9279,0.7153,3.974,1.2939,1.7089,2.8118,0.1582,1.5017,3.1999,1.5582,2.5614,6.5783,2.1703,1.7039,0.3102,0.1335,0.0007,0.2242]}
{"prompt":"Unicamp is generally regarded by the Brazilian population as Brazil 's Area 51 , with the government running a secret underground area purportedly called Pavilion 18 , located under the Institute of Chemistry . In","text":"Unicamp is generally regarded by the Brazilian population as Brazil's Area 51, with the government running a secret underground area purportedly called Pavilion 18, located under the Institute of Chemistry. In reality, Pavilion 18 is inside the campus, located off Piracicaba Road, at approximately 1 0 meters below the pavement.\nIn October, after the government finally announced it had completed an investigation and the university was found not to have any extraterrestrial technology at its disposal, the government granted the university permission to begin construction of an open secret area called Pavilion 18. The pavilion itself has a capacity of 100,000 square meters (approximately 2.86 miles quadrangle) and will create a vast underground laboratory. The pavilion houses the Pavilion 18 and the Pavilion 50.\nThe construction will also allow the university to house many secret facilities, including a biological shield.\nAlthough many have criticized or denied allegations regarding the existence of the facilities, some have suggested that these \"ovnis\" can be used as biological shields. For example, an \"ovni\" is alleged to be located about 5,000 meters (16,500 ft) southwest of the Pavilion 25 on the roof of the Institute of Chemistry.\nThis website discusses the many claims within the public domain concerning the alleged existence of extraterrestrial technology and bases of extraterrestrial intelligence at some Brazilian universities.\nIn 2012, it took only two days for the world's largest collection of \"ovnis\" to be uncovered at a Brazilian university, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. These OVNIs had been removed from the university's campus and hidden prior to public release by university staff. The \"ovnis \" were reportedly located in one of the university's buildings. The UFO's were reportedly taken to the university's UFO Museum. According to The S\u00e3o Paulo Times: \nThe most famous of the UFOs is one that mysteriously vanished off the Sao Paulo roof in 2013 shortly after a Brazilian government watchdog claimed it had found evidence of extraterrestrial technology on a campus there. \n\nThe site claims this UFO was sent from the Brazilian government and that the UFO was used as biological shield technology during the war against the extraterrestrials. Many government officials have denied this.\nThis site has detailed descriptions of many of the possible evidence related to alleged extraterrestrial technology and bases on Earth, including the alleged discovery of alien craft on the Brazil University campus.\nAdditionally, the Brazilian government has previously released pictures of aliens that are believed to be extraterrestrial craft.","token_len":506,"entropy":[7.1815,7.7094,3.9342,6.8429,3.3771,3.4626,2.7209,7.4265,4.5405,0.2178,5.3655,0.0263,14.0079,4.1968,1.8096,2.235,2.0241,5.1489,6.9242,1.5115,5.0408,4.6587,7.1138,11.3064,4.7161,11.9054,5.6348,1.7411,3.5533,4.8688,0.5772,7.82,0.5293,6.1684,1.4896,3.4595,3.3271,0.1622,3.0744,0.1136,0.5336,7.5089,0.9387,7.3902,2.0115,4.3515,4.6426,10.5966,4.4614,3.5246,6.3659,1.6528,1.1767,3.6064,4.5251,2.5252,7.4394,9.8218,2.9029,0.6585,6.3565,0.7489,1.1902,8.7673,4.5263,2.6795,5.2344,1.8846,3.4113,5.0732,3.5587,3.2077,2.2164,3.2655,4.1386,1.7,4.3283,3.4864,4.063,1.8117,5.0196,2.8409,0.99,0.9532,3.6122,8.3513,0.241,4.9577,3.1629,1.7661,0.9555,0.1425,1.448,3.1494,6.5176,1.7509,1.8819,2.6043,0.0377,3.774,1.8831,1.0859,2.1894,6.2913,5.9514,3.0538,2.0521,2.6768,0.6853,0.6668,1.715,6.6317,0.0012,5.1036,2.9884,2.1476,5.2304,0.1604,3.7961,1.072,0.0339,1.7397,0.1937,2.5626,4.303,2.9229,1.3275,6.7712,3.9393,13.5787,0.0598,5.5986,1.3892,0.708,3.1957,5.3233,1.1343,3.9991,2.3584,3.9885,2.1048,1.7714,3.5763,0.0036,6.4794,2.5488,8.1518,1.0159,5.4798,1.7293,5.1836,7.4844,2.4961,0.9996,1.5395,4.3661,3.9198,2.872,3.2962,1.0831,3.1247,0.1864,5.2669,5.0054,6.5616,3.4795,1.3556,0.5323,1.43,6.9976,8.0898,3.8985,1.6378,4.7883,4.4699,3.2777,3.8353,7.2558,4.5488,6.6983,4.4616,0.5954,2.2936,0.0333,2.844,5.4434,0.4102,3.2179,1.0155,2.6788,0.3438,3.0446,5.6494,10.5272,12.9724,2.0717,4.841,0.7606,1.6804,1.4295,4.4491,1.3825,1.5183,4.5565,0.5943,0.0404,3.9935,5.0929,0.924,2.9891,0.2186,1.5009,9.7926,0.0511,0.6694,4.7629,5.3793,3.5623,3.2138,0.2729,0.3016,1.2512,3.5713,0.0642,2.461,2.4288,0.2826,6.9021,0.0564,0.356,2.7127,6.1844,4.2029,0.8582,7.316,0.1258,0.3275,2.6528,0.1238,0.6806,0.6819,1.2751,4.2355,6.2746,5.463,1.1798,6.352,4.7286,6.634,0.5034,5.241,1.577,3.1533,0.4092,4.6019,2.4282,0.0404,5.1523,0.0706,1.4285,2.5253,7.6166,4.1068,2.7368,0.1017,2.474,4.7243,5.9704,9.3858,0.4911,0.368,1.0695,2.8392,4.8225,0.2169,5.0751,6.0307,5.0213,2.711,2.5927,0.4789,0.8485,5.7975,1.008,1.3505,6.7276,0.0236,3.9847,3.0414,2.8876,0.0727,0.3424,0.9071,4.0716,2.0212,2.1827,1.3485,0.6788,1.5851,3.6983,1.4125,3.9604,0.2278,3.3553,0.0315,0.0222,0.4131,5.1688,8.2205,0.5827,2.3023,3.1943,4.8567,0.5814,5.9033,0.5216,0.7868,1.8718,0.7532,3.4027,2.0293,5.9979,9.1107,0.0131,5.7978,2.9664,3.2229,4.5771,3.1746,0.6984,1.9512,4.136,1.1102,1.7132,8.285,1.2006,3.6926,3.3579,1.1808,4.9256,0.1679,0.2213,2.3934,0.0931,3.0875,1.779,2.0247,6.6262,2.846,0.8239,2.4643,4.7906,1.1977,0.9248,2.3474,0.4792,6.8763,4.0794,1.9141,3.9629,0.0019,4.1845,5.7133,0.0759,0.0024,0.9463,3.6437,7.7287,6.6575,1.9798,5.7278,3.1656,1.6458,0.7275,4.0474,2.3887,4.0074,1.6273,6.1894,2.3436,3.9336,0.4865,8.6849,0.0867,6.5022,1.1975,4.3157,7.234,0.232,2.8981,4.455,2.4635,7.7011,5.1114,1.5723,1.097,2.6225,2.4468,0.3047,0.4843,0.0678,2.2573,3.3011,1.7218,4.4729,6.0536,0.1973,3.5888,2.3172,6.9971,1.613,6.1893,6.2436,5.8612,1.0731,1.0011,5.4058,1.7444,1.4326,3.8351,1.5122,2.3074,2.2841,1.477,1.9709,1.0051,4.362,1.8171,5.8212,1.3813,5.6187,3.0977,1.0245,5.1196,1.4924,0.6868,6.4821,0.8721,0.0015,0.0003,0.6132,6.0863,6.4548,0.8493,1.373,2.428,1.4345,2.8531,0.8774,11.4411,3.2563,2.5969,6.3132,4.9236,0.201,2.991,1.2865,0.1115,5.6174,6.0454,4.6115,0.0227,5.6135,0.3667,0.1065,0.7393,2.0398,2.7176,4.7289,3.7738,1.9559,0.7593,1.6612,4.6591,4.4321,0.1063,4.5222,4.5633,2.8308,1.003,6.3036,4.9223,0.9336,0.7793,0.8137,13.0042,0.0347,1.6623,3.1387,0.3644,0.8003,5.294,4.3714,4.7413,0.4294,5.6962,2.8806,2.5516,1.2464,0.0145,0.5844,2.9687,0.4136,4.9959,1.1432]}

On September 14, the system increased in convection as it moved to the northern Gulf of Mexico, reaching a minimum central pressure of 1007 hPa on September 16. The intensification continued as the system moved to Florida on September 21, with the low then becoming a Hurricane on September 23. However, the storm moved near the Georgia coastline on September 23 and split into two systems, one of the two moving northward along the coast and the other moving off Cuba into the Atlantic. Eventually, the weaker system dissipated in the Atlantic on September 29.\nThe system reached its peak intensity on September 28 at a maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0mph (350\u00a0km\/h). This is the first hurricane in the modern era on Georgia's coast.\n\nPreparations and warnings\n\nThe National Hurricane Center released a tropical wave watch for Florida and the Bahamas beginning September 19. The watch was issued to all coastal regions extending inland from a line parallel to the Florida Atlantic coast at 26.5\u00b0N from the mouth of the Everglades to the Georgia panhandle. The tropical wave watch was upgraded to a tropical depression watch on September 21.\nInitially, there were no warnings that this tropical wave would develop into a hurricane, but as the system moved to the north side of Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued on September 20 for the region west of the Tampa Bay metropolitan area including portions of the counties of Pasco, Hillsborough, Brevard, Volusia, Orange, St. Johns and Putnam. The warning was upgraded to a hurricane advisory on September 21. The system was given the name \"Sandy\" before it became a hurricane on September 22. There is a chance of significant flooding in coastal areas.\nOn September 22, Hurricane Sandy was upgraded from a hurricane to a major hurricane with winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km\/h). This made Sandy the fifth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.\nThe hurricane began to track east-northeastward along the Georgia coastline on September 23 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The landfall on the east coast of Georgia was expected to occur between Chatham and Savannah near Point Pleasant, Georgia. Before the landfall, the storm made landfall in the northern Gulf of Mexico. However, before the landfall, Hurricane Sandy hit the Gulf Coast with wind gusts over 100\u00a0mph and heavy rainfall.","token_len":507,"entropy":[5.4872,11.8739,1.4128,2.8203,7.0808,9.8963,2.0566,4.8253,5.0599,0.6462,7.4239,0.3432,4.3157,3.3896,3.7818,8.4469,6.2678,5.5641,6.5103,2.893,1.3082,2.3561,1.6233,3.2017,5.4284,0.6942,5.2653,0.6638,3.7624,0.6177,1.8313,7.8837,6.5146,1.1893,12.321,0.4212,3.8252,0.9665,2.0992,3.4888,0.6803,4.1653,3.3095,0.2765,0.0871,1.6203,4.6836,1.8333,6.5483,9.7081,1.2393,0.3917,4.3577,8.943,8.2421,0.0051,3.3273,0.9263,2.1024,0.5261,1.5692,7.6288,0.2005,5.2048,3.1947,0.7298,1.0537,2.26,2.0787,5.3801,2.2298,0.1859,2.748,1.2705,3.179,1.5952,5.6228,9.0174,5.2427,2.2429,8.6337,2.8032,0.6696,1.6945,0.566,5.1589,0.0872,1.2161,4.5467,2.9846,7.361,0.6381,7.0089,4.2793,0.4981,0.3086,2.5568,1.331,8.9098,1.58,0.9675,4.9859,1.7629,1.8316,2.5201,2.7166,3.2598,3.2966,1.6343,1.6956,3.4182,0.2944,2.7362,1.5034,0.2695,0.0939,1.8634,6.5102,9.0868,5.7189,0.3003,1.4678,0.7184,6.6971,0.4123,0.614,8.7882,1.4404,5.8441,0.0017,2.8315,0.8886,1.536,3.4415,0.3324,2.4028,1.3903,1.0988,6.6901,3.8898,4.5035,1.8198,2.9309,2.9802,0.6959,1.0401,3.136,2.9382,2.3991,0.8058,4.3401,3.5011,0.0684,6.1414,12.4983,3.5971,1.1302,5.1094,3.5859,0.7079,0.7542,0.0222,1.0886,2.7973,2.535,1.191,2.8477,3.2042,2.5978,1.3518,4.1513,1.8111,4.8907,9.6506,0.8554,1.9279,1.3896,1.6527,8.6283,6.9017,2.1258,0.4674,4.2379,5.1786,1.8419,0.0695,1.7551,2.9831,0.3625,0.0241,5.7691,1.0187,5.8497,5.2372,3.3341,1.5013,2.6524,2.8893,1.7342,3.7434,5.0709,2.7018,3.6242,0.5955,1.3347,1.6482,2.0922,2.4932,2.0132,2.7861,2.9362,3.5007,9.2022,3.4222,0.5862,5.4924,5.2827,6.7263,0.0783,0.2666,3.2629,5.4123,3.5711,4.3331,6.0352,2.3456,1.422,2.4297,1.1162,6.0988,1.093,5.8004,0.0764,0.4851,5.869,0.0011,0.0023,1.8294,0.7868,5.5114,9.1528,0.0081,0.8932,1.3975,4.9769,0.9823,0.7091,1.3232,6.7117,0.5623,0.9725,1.9128,5.2096,0.9895,1.0441,0.6147,2.1633,0.905,0.9103,15.5446,0.3978,3.5299,0.8174,1.8799,1.07,4.9905,2.8335,2.918,2.3297,0.9872,4.3083,1.9572,0.5399,0.6242,1.5107,0.6976,3.0176,0.7583,2.2255,1.8742,2.2375,0.7834,3.024,5.1613,0.0881,2.214,0.7262,3.3603,3.3907,0.8116,3.0591,0.879,0.0941,2.425,0.4656,2.9946,3.7329,1.4097,4.1681,5.3629,0.0344,0.6941,6.092,0.4509,4.378,0.0569,6.791,4.7258,0.0171,1.2353,7.3979,0.2838,6.3122,0.0104,0.6536,6.2922,0.0169,0.2866,6.4459,0.0121,0.3285,6.6053,0.0349,0.0011,0.3119,5.5517,0.5275,4.9606,0.1812,1.8944,1.2214,6.3445,0.0106,0.9733,1.474,2.0352,0.9991,4.8551,0.1911,0.3808,1.6429,4.7215,0.7393,0.2147,0.9242,0.5346,2.2215,3.8553,1.5248,6.2458,2.378,4.5792,2.5299,3.726,3.2108,2.3963,4.7385,1.9416,2.7487,0.8274,0.9646,1.3547,0.3081,1.5576,0.2814,5.3788,2.6891,1.71,4.8098,2.6732,5.4165,2.8992,1.0811,4.6938,0.2984,2.3979,0.6265,7.2911,0.2506,1.3648,0.2868,2.734,4.0142,2.1499,5.1511,2.9423,0.3946,1.2553,0.5987,0.2758,4.6881,0.727,3.3875,2.6096,0.4131,4.1433,2.489,0.3377,0.0582,3.7967,0.0282,0.0063,0.0279,0.0032,0.7261,2.4324,4.9787,3.1753,0.873,3.7066,5.7018,1.863,2.5293,0.3368,8.3963,2.3602,0.319,0.1114,0.6681,1.3181,1.939,3.2514,6.5688,1.9199,6.0192,3.7375,3.2816,2.3137,0.0182,0.0067,3.8771,2.5098,0.2239,4.4764,2.4417,0.8763,0.1877,1.749,1.8733,6.5094,0.0078,5.2689,1.2282,0.7051,1.3557,7.0477,2.782,1.0212,3.1858,0.4935,0.7622,1.3466,1.2311,4.6496,0.3907,2.7432,3.0113,9.8313,0.6972,0.6584,3.8154,4.4724,6.4556,2.9205,1.5567,1.6216,0.8262,7.6513,1.1925,2.9377,0.3955,0.9702,1.3893,4.592,0.1149,1.3958,1.4325,4.2636,1.2331,0.1034,0.1515,1.5564,3.5247,0.0073,4.347,1.0583,0.9691,0.3209,3.2651,2.2702,4.3102,0.7756,1.5921,1.2142,4.4403,4.4537,0.9647,0.0249,4.3887,2.3379,1.6119,0.1042,5.9925,5.456,1.2218,0.9484]}

This took place early @ - @ November and would be called the \u201csmall raid.\u201d\nVan Fleet began the small raid by sending forces to two isolated hills with the intention of forcing the Union army to retreat further. These hills are now part of the town of Litchfield and they are still referred to today as Haggerty\u2019s Ridge from the time of the small raid. The two hills are located in a narrow valley which can be seen at the base of the aerial photograph below.\nHere we see at right the northern edge of the valley in question. On the right is the area at which the Union army began its initial defense against the raid; on the left side are the two hills of Haggerty\u2019s Ridge.\nWe know that the Union army did retire a few miles from the western edge of the town of Litchfield upon first being attacked, and that this retreat took place on the morning of @ - @ November @ - @ 5.\nBelow in the bottom row, the two hills of Haggerty\u2019s Ridge can be seen on the southern edge of the town of Litchfield. See Figure 1.\nThe Union Army was reinforced by Colonel William A. W. Sproat\u2019s division around the time of the small raid. Sproat had also been commanding the 16th Tennessee Cavalry, a corps that was a part of the Union Army at the time of the small raid. Sproat\u2019s regiment was composed of three militia regiments, the 18th Tennessee Cavalry, the 14th Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry and the 13th Tennessee Cavalry. These militia regiments would go on to be a part of the 1st, 9th and 10th Volunteers after the fact.\nSproat\u2019s plan was to attack the Confederate trenches on the left side of the town at an early hour, which was about @ - @ 6:00 AM. The small raid was also planned to be a surprise attack. Sproat ordered every troop to remain ambushed until the Confederates got within 150 yards of the Union forces. Sproat was well aware from previous operations with the same types of terrain that the Confederate force would be heavily reinforced and would be protected from attack by some of the houses.","token_len":508,"entropy":[7.8253,12.7738,9.6959,5.1115,7.4429,6.208,2.2229,3.0199,0.2845,0.8468,1.6488,5.6374,8.6938,5.7529,7.3406,3.1256,6.203,2.6551,11.1723,4.3051,2.5099,2.8535,10.1084,7.4437,9.5866,1.0872,3.5736,2.6481,2.1902,7.5748,5.8127,2.8926,1.5528,5.831,4.0291,0.1697,0.4718,4.4776,1.0096,3.0878,6.3214,1.0147,4.5638,5.7477,0.3426,1.0983,1.7078,1.4226,6.2903,2.0737,5.8597,2.0167,11.8447,6.4717,10.3858,5.191,2.7283,6.7313,7.2637,2.4494,13.4808,0.0348,3.8936,1.914,4.9908,0.4154,2.6037,4.2482,6.7841,1.0219,6.901,4.8041,5.3609,4.396,2.8478,1.0885,0.1651,4.9024,1.0268,8.616,3.4964,0.687,0.6463,6.1651,1.9585,4.2408,1.5099,2.8747,3.5157,3.6985,0.0025,0.6391,4.5795,1.9508,5.6809,4.3666,0.0232,2.5237,3.12,1.3216,4.7046,7.3779,0.0389,6.3216,0.1048,4.8632,6.2349,0.6022,11.539,6.5883,4.4913,2.5531,7.5017,0.9548,4.2818,1.2365,0.8395,6.7318,0.1472,0.5093,2.1053,5.1725,1.3095,1.284,2.2984,1.4931,2.2731,4.2379,0.9931,3.5912,4.1276,0.3791,1.4476,3.4812,0.6707,3.5525,0.051,0.4806,9.0952,3.9025,1.985,0.2837,1.1399,5.9926,2.9601,0.8149,5.2045,3.9911,0.9414,5.6508,3.1862,0.0928,0.4099,3.1869,4.4644,7.1678,0.7309,4.4529,0.5509,2.111,1.6298,0.7265,3.5621,4.1258,2.9523,0.8278,2.5427,1.4022,3.3168,2.2488,4.192,7.0641,1.743,0.4434,4.9913,6.6133,2.2765,0.0432,0.4951,3.951,2.9633,0.5286,2.3643,0.8691,3.9597,2.0096,0.0283,0.0008,1.5824,0.0624,0.1135,0.0226,1.1286,1.1495,4.5972,4.5438,0.9935,1.0894,1.9919,0.9907,3.5694,11.2792,4.0133,1.406,3.4247,1.6027,0.9667,6.0344,2.7494,0.07,0.6141,2.122,2.3729,0.5157,0.0009,0.0005,6.1227,5.7193,4.8245,2.3392,2.401,2.1425,1.4614,1.8747,2.1097,3.2264,0.0465,2.2399,1.0021,2.0043,0.0591,6.6889,0.6584,1.285,0.994,10.1291,1.3586,1.4266,10.332,2.4772,1.8427,5.749,4.9704,0.2582,5.4952,4.5528,2.2747,2.1021,4.4695,0.9031,1.1792,0.2194,0.0017,0.001,0.4322,0.0006,0.007,0.0032,4.9936,0.1043,0.0888,3.1267,0.2811,5.5403,1.6632,0.1674,0.211,3.7415,1.3396,0.5638,0.0025,0.0005,0.4426,7.1769,6.1307,1.56,1.2402,0.6867,1.9569,2.5331,2.3606,2.7428,5.8539,1.2934,8.6736,3.6502,4.0611,0.111,4.9602,1.9946,6.4343,4.7666,1.9792,4.972,0.1494,0.3587,5.5654,6.0938,1.2334,2.9808,0.2362,0.1546,1.3678,0.0244,0.7538,2.9497,0.0023,0.0008,2.9212,4.643,1.2501,4.6628,0.7122,6.7969,0.0342,6.9026,2.3619,0.001,2.8541,3.0499,5.2301,1.9197,1.516,4.6496,1.5617,0.0078,0.1444,2.2751,0.9923,2.4029,0.4553,0.165,0.6284,0.128,1.6832,0.0148,0.2161,2.2429,0.0008,0.0009,5.379,0.0018,0.0228,3.8335,0.8597,3.3974,0.1844,3.0712,8.6641,3.2303,0.0066,1.3227,2.4105,4.863,0.0643,1.2982,0.43,0.0001,0.4832,1.3683,3.7065,0.005,0.643,5.4957,4.0402,0.0001,1.2961,0.1918,3.3844,0.0118,0.5221,1.6615,0.0002,0.4337,3.5482,3.7043,0.127,0.0039,4.5064,3.8993,0.2831,0.1324,2.1459,3.0889,0.6588,0.0018,0.0878,4.5943,0.03,3.4031,4.4074,0.0094,0.923,2.3996,0.0015,6.5862,6.6488,0.6112,5.8139,0.4271,0.8345,5.303,1.1546,0.0479,1.074,0.002,0.0286,7.265,1.4762,0.5236,2.1663,0.7541,6.2353,6.5913,2.3782,0.4462,3.6237,1.4968,0.1295,0.3029,0.6993,3.8601,4.3079,2.2803,1.5481,2.0207,3.8964,2.1869,4.4316,8.7272,0.2635,1.1672,3.1793,1.1301,1.9504,3.2563,0.7486,1.4364,4.6595,0.3483,1.322,4.3513,2.2017,0.5167,2.4164,2.1579,4.0848,0.4252,2.4587,2.583,0.002,0.0008,5.6586,6.2755,5.3665,0.9449,5.3228,10.0875,0.1698,2.0003,1.2496,5.0393,0.0077,4.5478,3.9521,5.9423,0.1115,0.3319,0.4179,4.2401,2.695,0.6716,2.9543,0.003,0.0009,2.8526,4.8386,0.2329,7.3353,5.7038,3.4704,5.0465,0.7027,6.2817,7.8083,0.0142,5.6524,0.7282,1.3149,2.9178,4.7224,2.2608,1.3361,5.9138,3.5656,2.9041,2.0886,1.4061,6.7662,1.345,2.5224,1.1693,4.9425,0.7272,0.2482,9.0517,3.1048]}

Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not consider it necessary to send any further reinforcements to Rome, fearing that Vitellius might be prepared to raise a rebellion at any moment. It was not until late in 70 when he considered Vitellius'intentions to be too menacing, that he appointed the generals Petronius and Vespasianus to protect the republic.\nVespasian had to overcome formidable obstacles to reach the throne in the early first decades of the republic. Some had even hoped to see him succeed an already reigning Prince -Consort, as he thought he had the support of a faction, headed by Otho. The situation was complicated by the intrigues of a group of nobles who had been defeated by Vitellius and were anxious to recover their property and to place some of them on the throne. Furthermore, because of his military achievements during the Italian Wars, Vitellius was perceived as an alternative candidate, a person whose ambitions might not be so easily discouraged ( although this impression might have been exaggerated ) by the nobles.\nVespasian had also to meet certain obstacles on the way to his coronation. He had to fight against the factions supporting Otho and his cousin, Domitius Ahenobarbus. Vespasian was able to maintain a favourable impression, winning Otho over by his devotion to Rome and by the recognition of his military achievements, but when this seemed to be enough, Otho turned to Domitius, who had been appointed to rule the entire Eastern province of Asia Minor. Domitius, convinced that he could overtake Vespasian, attacked him with the assistance of the army he commanded.\nVespasian finally managed to persuade members of a faction, headed by the Piso family, to support the succession of Titus.\nVespasian then proceeded towards the capitol and received the imperial crown with great fanfare and enthusiasm. The day of the coronation, Titus had to put on his imperial crown himself. Only then did he think his struggle with Vitellius had been a success. However, the success of the struggle for the succession only saved Rome from complete ruin because the struggle had also made the whole nation more aware of the dangers of anarchy and lawlessness.","token_len":508,"entropy":[2.311,7.0896,3.2813,5.8135,0.23,0.8012,3.9232,6.7196,1.2622,4.8563,3.3362,7.2718,0.017,5.3073,0.0152,5.7971,1.029,6.9494,3.0092,4.8157,0.3772,7.372,0.0167,7.2118,6.0305,5.5143,0.0169,1.4576,8.0953,1.2146,11.0644,1.2541,3.1036,6.8476,5.1874,2.5604,1.3923,3.1201,5.747,5.2915,8.2784,4.9746,5.4568,0.0098,0.0145,4.7639,0.0649,6.1933,1.6843,0.9764,0.3531,4.5999,2.5719,4.5511,1.7867,1.2376,3.9224,2.2205,3.838,0.7334,4.2492,0.8771,0.0083,0.003,1.6751,2.2054,7.3136,0.1311,6.9064,1.6326,1.5387,4.4764,0.6602,1.0965,0.2726,4.3876,0.4052,2.9594,0.3548,2.765,1.5769,2.8201,3.1049,2.5456,5.441,3.6359,0.3613,0.0032,0.0015,2.3772,18.0191,2.919,1.0791,4.8513,3.6876,9.9541,1.824,3.0049,0.7041,6.0768,2.5967,6.6598,7.1806,1.3035,0.2266,1.1868,4.2463,1.305,0.0076,0.0869,4.2624,0.7061,5.268,1.1281,4.7333,0.9538,1.5067,7.2168,1.1711,0.0024,0.0717,3.4624,5.1164,5.8624,7.5437,2.8812,1.7114,3.9689,1.1351,3.1467,2.5666,1.7543,3.797,7.809,4.6398,0.1192,0.5772,2.077,1.3111,5.7795,5.0297,4.8564,6.3321,1.1066,4.5135,0.8772,3.4446,6.8961,3.3585,9.8086,6.5999,7.3654,13.5503,2.6245,3.9756,4.2813,2.0189,5.6762,2.0657,2.2731,3.2056,3.6489,0.0568,3.9191,5.1872,5.2588,8.0077,0.0517,6.5157,3.0339,0.8927,1.8911,2.7681,4.7867,0.8802,4.1005,0.2725,0.6122,7.9193,0.0047,1.0419,3.0202,3.3955,0.1962,3.9495,1.768,1.364,1.8072,6.8298,0.8532,1.9601,1.2057,0.0043,0.0024,2.3366,2.6447,6.4959,0.1385,6.5421,0.9508,5.0829,2.4684,3.9129,6.3506,4.6526,1.5674,3.5772,2.0893,1.2766,0.297,0.3905,6.0074,0.0656,5.3917,0.9081,2.3822,4.9841,5.4961,3.7305,0.3432,6.4298,1.9803,0.7037,1.4934,0.2389,0.0029,0.0018,1.2378,5.1293,0.5918,2.531,6.8026,3.216,3.0215,3.5649,3.8003,3.5059,5.2585,2.8875,2.5672,0.7485,4.3849,1.997,8.7365,6.0334,10.7573,3.1382,7.4125,2.6969,1.0448,0.5944,1.8814,3.3108,2.1451,1.2311,4.3308,1.4233,1.4395,2.2991,1.1261,0.0014,0.0364,2.6397,2.399,2.9451,5.4212,4.3641,1.8807,4.3845,0.7223,1.29,0.2726,2.6249,4.0019,0.0027,0.7293,2.3819,0.9046,0.9376,4.2843,2.3754,1.3077,6.7076,6.6682,4.6779,0.0204,0.003,1.6903,2.0198,4.8834,1.6304,6.1563,0.2997,1.3118,6.8518,9.1953,6.0978,5.3072,1.6102,3.1341,0.8765,0.0011,0.0232,1.913,4.7426,0.0335,4.8095,2.4781,6.0195,4.4908,3.3977,4.9787,7.5394,0.0054,0.0023,2.8665,1.8326,3.7601,7.1738,0.3555,4.9966,1.0923,1.7784,2.3184,6.7622,0.6695,0.9621,3.5281,1.6238,2.89,1.3324,4.6793,4.1552,5.6722,0.945,0.7095,4.6973,0.5973,3.6605,0.0023,0.0011,4.5828,2.2849,7.3265,0.0096,0.0041,2.0421,0.8051,1.7264,1.9019,3.6926,2.1684,5.3742,1.391,4.8208,6.2841,3.8415,1.5662,4.6363,0.1306,0.8227,2.3424,0.0038,0.0032,2.3997,5.6806,0.3764,2.1328,1.0971,8.558,0.4339,1.1199,0.0016,0.026,1.5452,5.9259,2.7074,1.6624,2.6469,4.2925,0.0014,1.723,4.1169,3.5483,3.9761,1.303,2.6057,2.1032,0.135,0.0014,0.0284,5.0988,3.1633,0.0266,4.4715,9.6443,0.0108,3.6192,1.4158,2.4093,4.4407,0.018,2.0799,5.6144,4.0711,3.4984,0.1998,0.3668,3.0439,2.4018,7.4699,0.8568,5.8741,1.8714,4.6715,1.6351,0.3566,0.0013,0.0426,4.1467,4.6506,5.5299,0.9813,8.1438,0.0057,2.6784,4.7715,1.3199,5.1717,4.0424,4.6859,2.3786,2.6326,0.0021,3.5926,4.2536,0.1565,2.3961,5.8775,2.1333,2.0318,0.5516,0.0015,2.2198,5.0206,2.3635,4.3441,6.3599,2.6476,1.5092,3.7469,3.3431,6.5317,1.7439,6.2355,2.6508,0.3703,0.7735,5.6641,5.3008,8.3865,2.2094,1.2652,0.4908,0.004,0.0013,4.7073,2.3101,3.6251,1.1441,0.4734,3.6134,0.0302,2.3032,5.362,0.6912,1.5123,6.2625,4.1514,0.5486,2.9437,6.0094,7.1803,6.3144,0.6106,5.3661,1.7504,6.3513,1.9327,7.9805,2.0984,3.9392,4.1754,1.9468,4.1839,3.7205,3.0806,5.052,0.1237,0.726,2.16,0.6869,6.2342,1.0326,1.339,0.006,0.3991]}

At 0000 UTC the following day, the area of disturbed weather became organized and was shown to be connected with the surface low seen at 1900 UTC 19 October and the low-pressure system seen on radar at 0000 UTC 20 October. Figure 8 shows the surface low and the trough and how the strong surface low pressure at 0000 UTC on 20 October initiated precipitation.\nNorthern Hemisphere. A number of surface troughs were observed north of the Aleutian Islands from the beginning of October through the end of the month. Figure 9 shows a number of troughs that crossed the northern North America from 15 October through 15 November. Many of these troughs were associated with moisture laden air flowing from the mid-Atlantic or mid-latitudes over the Pacific Ocean, and into the western sector of the US Pacific Northwest. All of the troughs seen during this period over North America had a strong surface low pressure center to the south of the trough. This surface low played an important role in the development of the heavy rains that started to occur in the northern Northwest in November. The trough seen in Fig. 9 at 1470 UTC 18 October was connected with the heavy rains that occurred in the northeastern US from 10 to 13 November.\nSummary\nA number of trough systems were observed throughout the year 1980 on the eastern and western coasts of North America. The largest number of them were seen along the eastern Pacific coast. The northern North American mid-Atlantic troughs were less numerous, however, they were located off of the North American continent in the mid-latitude westerly winds and had a strong impact on the weather in the northeastern United States, the northern Northwest, and the mid-West. Another interesting group of troughs was seen along the mid-latitude western coast of North America. These trough systems tended to be oriented north-south on the sea surface, crossed the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean, and had a strong impact on the weather in the southern United States and western Canada. A number of trough systems were observed over North America in the western sector of the Pacific Northwest. These trough systems tended to be oriented east-west on the sea surface.\nA variety of precipitation associated with these troughs was observed throughout the year. In general, precipitation was heavy where the troughs were situated over the mid-latitude mid-latitudes and was light where the troughs were located south of the subtropics.","token_len":509,"entropy":[7.7499,3.5343,0.4592,5.9449,5.707,15.833,1.8041,9.9816,6.2145,0.2403,12.3144,0.0022,4.1698,0.8903,8.1671,2.1728,1.3894,0.0987,0.0135,2.8497,0.709,3.7106,11.84,2.6987,2.5704,5.6708,0.625,0.7924,1.2555,4.9666,2.769,10.1309,5.2587,4.0556,9.645,2.897,4.1783,5.8356,1.4506,0.4443,7.2568,1.3406,0.7244,6.0427,6.6302,12.2994,2.3308,5.3796,0.0876,11.062,3.8442,4.3046,1.4664,4.341,5.268,3.3595,2.9783,3.6239,2.8896,8.1972,1.5315,4.3215,0.0267,2.1103,0.1418,0.2989,6.9375,3.4813,1.6243,0.5966,3.5443,1.6324,3.0556,1.3123,4.8482,4.6727,5.1913,1.4816,7.7191,3.3198,2.3952,6.0411,4.8507,3.5224,0.0294,5.9771,3.3181,0.058,9.6125,5.8067,1.2498,1.9311,17.4235,0.8053,5.0114,3.9328,6.1012,0.0071,5.4875,2.8188,0.1142,1.3645,2.0326,4.8927,0.2216,0.9881,6.7967,0.0195,0.4193,0.347,4.2509,2.1988,3.956,0.0922,1.2755,1.9759,0.9876,0.5283,0.004,3.4651,1.3402,0.998,2.5531,0.3431,0.2113,2.1954,3.4118,0.0117,1.8166,0.0339,2.5064,6.1003,0.5862,2.9086,6.3299,3.5777,3.6221,6.0872,1.4076,1.4488,3.2279,0.4989,0.6687,6.161,0.5486,0.4825,0.8072,0.0274,0.9053,5.0633,0.018,6.6377,9.0613,0.0021,5.109,4.4868,1.6212,0.5635,6.7026,0.8753,1.5856,4.7851,4.4236,0.0506,3.5066,0.1606,4.4475,0.6749,3.979,0.9102,2.2879,1.8859,8.5454,0.4953,3.4363,9.3586,0.0607,0.3561,4.5322,2.7801,3.5844,0.5056,5.4169,1.0039,1.0712,0.483,0.058,5.3734,3.1704,1.675,0.3535,6.9248,3.6493,0.0549,4.2182,1.835,2.9798,1.3872,0.6144,0.467,9.0503,4.7981,1.8053,1.8631,1.6973,0.3732,2.8164,1.0682,3.355,5.5507,0.0689,9.8681,1.4201,0.0472,0.075,0.1044,1.2243,3.8616,0.0666,0.8732,7.6094,3.0373,1.3712,4.8259,1.4341,2.3358,1.4102,1.2138,4.217,7.1236,1.7586,2.9411,1.0875,1.7442,2.0395,5.4877,1.7921,4.5345,0.1321,0.5919,5.4005,4.3691,4.8741,0.0445,4.5328,0.753,1.349,4.9151,0.809,0.633,5.0033,0.8608,1.4155,2.4264,1.2535,0.5731,4.9666,2.4446,2.9921,4.0699,2.187,2.8227,0.3385,0.49,1.7221,6.7466,2.0459,4.0329,1.5176,0.0014,3.0911,6.9702,1.2531,1.044,3.1719,0.3998,3.5153,10.4216,4.4383,0.7377,2.81,1.8132,0.6175,1.7842,0.1013,2.1115,0.0354,0.6854,1.4588,4.2793,3.9392,0.2348,6.4671,0.7497,2.7597,3.6786,0.2183,2.492,4.4358,1.4776,2.3081,1.2321,3.6771,2.8267,0.5842,9.5791,0.3509,1.3092,0.28,1.7971,1.1449,6.3729,3.9268,2.0044,3.6478,0.2342,6.2835,1.0112,4.1563,5.5088,2.3842,0.5026,3.8658,0.8071,3.0995,2.9306,0.8104,3.8135,0.2914,2.2769,3.7804,8.3096,0.0138,0.0826,4.0663,2.4129,4.0176,1.1671,1.2679,5.6186,0.0915,0.7608,3.7918,2.654,0.6295,4.5546,1.8756,0.0017,3.4003,3.0533,3.1849,4.3225,0.6273,0.2437,0.7486,5.0213,0.177,5.9675,0.4132,6.6458,3.8837,6.4113,0.2471,0.3685,0.5302,1.3136,1.5743,1.7773,0.1151,6.1219,0.1316,1.7366,0.3316,4.5458,1.1812,0.5905,0.9765,0.0062,1.3931,1.6251,0.7798,2.0751,5.4476,0.0512,0.9267,3.7296,1.402,2.0046,0.5174,4.0691,0.451,6.4432,1.1836,1.1679,9.0607,0.8001,4.6996,0.0959,0.5679,0.2406,4.5137,2.3365,0.5505,0.2005,3.3484,0.8013,0.6228,2.5216,0.0797,0.2212,0.8622,0.5401,0.2601,2.128,0.7998,0.0021,1.9122,4.0317,1.0482,0.1528,3.6186,1.0507,0.0068,0.6986,0.3765,0.5928,1.6046,3.5627,2.3145,0.0425,1.7318,0.8244,5.576,5.9862,0.0902,0.0996,5.0431,0.1461,1.0295,2.1556,0.3372,0.3465,2.3968,0.0069,0.2478,0.4717,2.7712,0.2888,0.2698,0.8556,0.0403,0.3954,0.0096,2.8553,2.073,3.5054,4.6949,0.0015,4.3631,6.5721,0.2039,2.3923,0.412,1.4162,1.3785,1.1419,2.3169,0.1087,0.1562,0.7888,3.2005,3.9293,0.2367,2.5117,1.403,5.8901,7.9196,1.6974,1.5823,0.9509,0.7306,5.7472,5.3583,1.0306,4.0002,0.1353,0.1085,0.3134,5.339,0.1869,3.3996,0.3875,1.9054,3.2617,5.8232,0.5807,0.2452,0.0123,0.0483,0.0483,0.5083,2.9733,0.8417,0.0755,8.2344,0.0158,3.0815,0.2943]}
{"prompt":"The accident board stated that Bud Holland 's personality significantly influenced the crash sequence .

USAF personnel testified that Holland had developed a reputation as an aggressive pilot who often broke flight safety and other regulations. As the result, other flight crews tended to avoid flying with Holland, despite his demonstrated ability to fly. In fact, Holland's flight with another squadron of USAF Fokker Dr.I's on the 16th was not the usual first flight for the aircraft.\nHolland's Fokker II's were the most advanced fighter aircraft available to the US Air Force at the end of the war. They were fast and manoeuvrable, and carried heavy ordnance. The squadron assigned to Holland was tasked with the protection of the naval base at Pearl Harbor, and received a particularly tough assignment: they took over a P-40C squadron that had flown only a few missions during the war. That squadron had flown only one mission before it was transferred and redeployed to New Zealand. As a result, the crew had zero combat experience.\nDuring the patrol, Holland and his squadron encountered a Japanese dive bomber. The bomber was in range of the Fokker fighters to fire at it when, instead, the J-15 fighters opened fire at Holland's plane in an attempt to draw down the fighters and allow the bomber to escape. Holland's squadron fired back and, after a hard defensive struggle, the bomber was forced to crash into a tree. Holland's plane was also shot down. The accident board's report suggested that a Japanese Fokker bomber crew may have misinterpreted Holland's orders. Holland's commander's radio conversation indicated that he didn't want his fighters to fire at the bomber. When the Japanese pilot misunderstood those orders, he opened fire on Holland. Holland's pilot shot down the fighter, and Holland's pilot shot down the bomber.\nHolland's actions on the 16th were not unusual in that his pilot's actions had been justified on more than one occasion by the accident board. In general, military personnel of all ranks act at random or simply follow orders when a task is given to them. However, Holland was a former Fighter Pilot Instructor, and his actions on that patrol had been questioned. Holland's actions in this situation could lead to a situation in which other pilots would interpret his actions incorrectly. Holland's actions on that particular day may have created a dangerous precedent that should be avoided.\nThe accident board recommended that the USAF change its policy for assigning combat aircraft to fighter pilots with few combat experiences.","token_len":509,"entropy":[10.0529,10.5739,6.3864,0.7597,10.8608,9.7149,2.5702,9.7579,8.9519,2.8207,0.4583,4.1868,6.4774,0.8039,13.3208,5.2474,4.9748,0.2238,1.8512,2.1961,5.9856,0.6764,4.4245,1.6231,2.2523,2.493,3.8551,1.4564,3.8744,6.0964,7.6613,3.9038,4.359,4.6124,2.9701,0.5675,4.3407,2.6874,5.756,0.8753,6.4394,4.1807,3.7239,7.1669,0.0408,4.2281,3.5725,1.9485,0.6998,2.2576,4.8676,1.2273,6.3053,1.8965,0.2059,2.9273,2.3094,3.0312,2.948,0.0019,2.0655,1.81,3.7625,6.523,5.7618,5.3503,1.8878,2.3597,3.1627,8.5544,0.1013,9.018,0.7883,9.0014,6.9157,4.4966,1.8978,6.6068,0.234,2.4545,4.5247,3.3299,7.5681,5.2891,2.3947,1.8855,1.9448,4.2405,0.7323,1.881,10.029,0.0108,0.0036,1.2486,4.3214,0.0458,0.0023,5.61,4.9408,2.2635,2.9121,3.1358,4.2809,2.9256,1.5616,3.8253,1.4537,0.4359,3.4055,0.9129,0.0427,3.1105,0.1791,5.056,0.0022,0.6967,2.2208,0.384,2.3914,0.7944,5.6661,1.0542,5.723,0.0302,0.0075,0.9394,1.9578,5.6482,3.8574,3.2214,0.0,1.2278,1.9587,7.1977,6.6319,0.1585,2.6018,1.5843,5.1006,0.113,2.767,5.0913,0.0854,1.0075,8.1585,2.8925,1.7921,3.6242,0.0242,1.4448,1.7184,7.4694,2.2986,6.7896,3.8195,2.8477,2.3799,6.4577,5.0106,2.2935,2.6741,7.4403,0.673,3.6863,3.8605,4.6304,2.4384,1.1244,4.43,5.6871,2.6502,1.0553,2.235,2.2789,0.3243,0.7282,0.3689,5.3952,1.2761,2.0181,3.1952,1.8913,1.8231,0.9431,4.1869,3.5862,0.4122,3.8298,5.5434,7.3075,0.0002,0.003,0.6076,4.7846,2.7871,1.0148,4.0433,1.2384,0.1109,0.3185,0.959,4.5869,3.5247,7.7713,5.34,0.0937,1.5964,1.242,4.3267,0.5513,8.4447,1.7124,1.3495,3.0191,0.9223,1.8328,4.526,1.565,3.44,5.6285,0.1241,1.362,1.3383,2.1745,1.4687,4.1634,4.0917,0.4392,0.7126,2.5663,0.0071,0.0068,7.0638,6.3241,3.6146,1.3835,2.5118,5.8403,6.0455,5.2414,3.0186,1.2446,6.6208,0.6445,3.5262,5.7691,4.8455,0.0139,2.5392,2.5256,1.0323,3.4604,4.5702,2.7195,0.3883,0.0062,5.7753,4.0978,0.3598,4.4374,2.644,5.3756,0.8943,3.2895,0.1345,2.8945,0.2122,2.5726,1.6999,2.4898,4.5862,3.0423,2.2054,3.3414,2.5252,1.9847,6.0827,8.6398,3.8874,0.2803,1.4843,1.3263,1.6904,2.6309,0.25,3.1975,0.8538,1.5671,2.9586,0.9513,2.9488,1.4737,2.3825,0.9597,4.9065,3.6075,0.0309,1.748,1.7704,3.7001,0.3742,3.6609,0.9931,5.7101,0.1254,3.6074,4.6269,3.8299,0.2624,0.0014,2.1405,5.2509,4.9412,0.0525,9.9139,0.0012,3.4306,0.07,5.1378,1.8731,4.1918,1.0568,5.9029,5.2476,7.0732,5.5004,2.3399,0.1747,1.4388,5.3769,0.0008,1.8037,2.6575,4.2302,0.5271,2.6451,0.9835,0.7284,2.3023,1.4006,3.9867,1.159,3.7665,3.0178,8.9252,5.7452,0.4087,0.1742,1.2447,5.8371,0.0079,1.2289,2.622,3.0599,3.1422,1.2877,2.5677,4.8277,2.0639,0.2922,3.2879,1.5058,1.9925,3.6737,1.691,2.7123,2.7011,0.5966,0.3572,2.0705,0.4828,1.4013,2.4567,0.0064,0.001,0.6917,6.671,3.3385,0.6978,1.9498,0.0053,1.4455,2.547,1.8912,2.7638,3.5577,3.3393,4.2157,3.1958,2.2602,3.7765,1.6249,6.411,3.8798,6.2429,0.21,0.0376,0.0548,2.4522,1.3439,5.32,0.0604,0.8334,1.8542,6.0413,0.1011,5.6843,2.8375,5.4925,1.6816,1.3988,8.1533,4.9629,3.636,4.6917,6.4923,3.5961,0.5407,3.9459,3.7888,6.1419,0.8283,4.6974,1.0632,0.0632,0.4465,2.6816,0.0076,2.9402,2.3913,2.4086,5.8721,6.7471,0.4674,6.9383,1.6623,0.627,1.665,0.5934,2.0106,3.4251,6.7535,3.3373,1.4105,6.2421,2.1337,4.725,0.7731,0.9475,3.0629,2.5066,3.5251,3.8439,5.4407,0.2194,2.1755,5.0521,1.4799,0.0094,4.8088,1.2899,2.4623,7.6875,0.7389,0.2562,6.2466,0.4924,4.9479,0.7259,0.6013,1.5907,1.5309,4.5484,1.4576,2.4657,0.3576,5.0512,0.8787,4.5469,5.4401,2.3067,4.1037,1.4453,1.9829,0.533,0.4672,1.8841,1.8469,0.0581,4.1851,0.4242,1.1473,2.5195,5.0909,0.5811,2.5339,3.381,5.927,2.8862,1.7124,0.3386,5.9974,0.726,4.8432,8.1113,0.7564,3.8858,0.4895]}

It became popular during the Kamakura Period, and was placed on the festival roster during that era as the god of good luck.\nWhile a kensho (\" spiritual animal\") during the Heian period or kenshu (\" spiritual animal\") during the late Heian period, it developed into a separate shrine and is now a place of worship for spirits and spirits since the time of the Nara period (710-794). Matsuki has its altar and shrine in the temple of Omiya in Shizuoka, near Hinamizawa shrine.\nIn Buddhism, the bodily form of any spiritual being is called a sakyamuni Buddha, and Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, is believed to be the first embodiment of this nature, or sakya-muni, Sakyamuni Buddha's name literally means \" Buddha of the Golden Age...\nDuring the course of that war, the shogun ordered the execution of over three hundred thousand men, many of them aged males, whom he thought fit to be executed. During these battles, women and babies were sometimes beheaded, and the soldiers frequently ate human flesh. The Japanese government at the time, however, did not officially support the war, and the shogun had little power, and it was up to the military to decide whether to allow troops to carry out massacres and pillages in war. The result of this war was a total destruction of the feudal system and the establishment of a modernized feudal system.","token_len":510,"entropy":[11.9174,2.4661,6.2681,5.1437,3.1512,7.918,2.1248,1.6101,6.3209,4.1868,6.2803,4.1678,3.617,4.64,2.3337,0.5944,2.0743,6.7846,5.1531,7.6649,0.706,3.4008,4.214,1.6226,8.7815,2.1148,7.2157,1.4471,5.0016,1.7624,7.4577,9.9941,0.5895,2.8466,4.6907,3.8362,0.22,2.1203,2.3656,0.0018,1.54,5.7753,1.816,1.7196,5.6362,2.6233,4.5706,2.3866,0.0347,0.5773,5.6937,0.9329,1.5654,7.475,3.6018,1.3385,4.9908,7.8443,2.4192,1.5916,4.8745,4.4187,1.5642,2.298,3.25,6.0483,1.5253,4.7386,7.0744,2.0225,1.1301,7.0291,4.5284,5.191,1.1819,0.2781,9.7727,2.129,7.4391,2.4042,4.1456,1.1647,3.8739,6.4463,4.7745,1.1938,2.3939,3.1303,1.6949,2.7817,3.3763,11.1893,1.6213,4.168,0.0026,5.1771,3.4639,0.0056,1.3252,2.3122,4.2696,7.8366,1.6768,2.5048,4.3128,2.1754,5.1321,6.8368,0.0974,0.0016,9.832,8.4634,3.8931,4.6355,4.1111,2.0394,1.8524,6.4302,10.8747,8.3551,5.8224,2.4006,1.2536,8.8977,8.6964,3.1906,1.7111,5.9821,1.0987,2.7749,2.8296,0.1654,1.5681,3.2093,8.6328,1.512,0.7727,1.4118,1.535,2.996,1.2095,4.4848,0.1506,1.0106,4.7962,4.139,4.7195,4.1037,0.8166,6.9765,1.0093,1.5463,1.045,1.5939,4.0425,0.1206,1.2557,4.2738,1.267,2.8651,5.4756,4.743,4.3804,1.0854,5.2978,1.7112,1.265,5.684,0.2193,1.415,5.3664,0.9154,6.5971,6.6276,4.2029,2.3916,5.7746,0.036,2.7768,3.5438,4.2173,5.4557,6.2127,6.615,7.2724,4.4326,3.0027,0.823,4.1425,1.6032,0.6782,1.7013,4.6597,1.6976,0.7559,1.5746,4.4793,0.8149,6.6658,4.7949,1.4065,4.2151,2.0811,3.5959,4.6822,3.3107,4.1489,3.4902,2.7452,0.2452,4.3614,0.0024,3.6991,0.9932,1.2733,2.3929,6.161,1.4307,0.8149,6.0212,5.9868,3.9881,4.0088,4.6788,3.6255,2.3606,5.13,0.2791,5.7381,1.0934,0.7241,1.3915,5.3875,3.8578,3.1752,0.0999,4.0571,4.3621,6.2122,2.5644,3.2223,8.3451,0.4497,2.0979,0.0017,0.3521,5.1085,6.7984,1.4067,3.9501,0.3494,2.4288,1.0955,3.1229,0.4791,0.0732,7.844,0.6337,0.0021,0.2858,2.7927,2.8966,6.9508,0.7595,0.626,5.1059,7.889,2.5861,3.7423,2.8037,2.9577,3.9588,0.8524,0.869,1.5381,5.346,2.063,2.1204,9.536,1.1201,3.1902,0.1601,0.7093,6.6245,3.1212,3.9725,1.9689,7.3495,0.6372,4.774,0.7409,5.1982,0.2292,3.3514,4.0818,10.7326,2.8007,1.8698,2.7744,0.9391,3.2928,0.4378,5.91,4.2653,1.5989,2.6297,3.2326,2.0784,0.0088,1.087,4.5929,7.5874,2.7363,1.0859,0.405,5.2342,1.2959,1.2821,2.804,5.7556,0.5783,1.173,8.8521,2.118,0.1984,5.0585,6.3606,2.2721,0.7159,0.5084,1.6064,3.5507,6.14,1.8809,0.1473,8.4205,1.3141,1.1138,7.1292,1.0744,0.4118,0.0126,1.4715,2.245,1.5777,5.4682,0.1172,2.2856,0.3808,0.7262,3.8431,0.0301,0.8844,0.6508,2.4766,6.9007,0.0218,1.8561,6.6732,2.3135,3.569,3.0627,0.8968,1.9376,3.2788,9.285,1.9902,1.4488,8.5334,0.4221,0.0312,0.0086,1.0834,4.1623,3.1247,6.9303,1.1439,0.5702,6.7396,1.1465,0.7851,7.3948,1.2243,9.6435,4.1084,5.5947,0.2009,7.7309,0.0013,5.8352,5.8186,1.1132,1.382,4.7414,0.1425,3.3896,1.0891,5.0481,0.0551,4.7529,4.467,0.8565,2.278,4.0704,1.6968,3.2879,0.1164,0.9838,6.8341,8.722,0.7976,6.2416,0.4286,3.394,5.3857,0.1777,1.3385,2.5946,1.015,4.0225,4.2682,4.7876,0.594,6.8968,1.6004,6.1935,0.254,5.1056,7.4305,0.0196,1.1905,1.0217,1.9123,5.5722,6.1612,5.2522,3.1098,0.3179,0.8988,1.9736,3.9301,2.6598,6.1921,0.7314,0.097,3.032,1.8242,0.0078,1.7606,0.0407,5.5516,5.15,0.9519,3.9222,0.986,0.6786,1.8335,2.3119,0.0536,3.7229,3.0694,2.5039,3.5168,1.4856,3.0789,0.538,4.3621,0.0097,0.6679,4.1554,1.0152,2.8379,1.5422,0.7136,3.0234,7.4376,0.5203,3.7186,0.112,5.7113,2.4767,6.018,1.3128,3.3625,4.4373,1.4996,1.9445,6.3737,1.4995,0.8762,2.8692,0.4379,1.9166,3.8744,3.4126,0.0425,0.9319,4.3406,0.916,2.0575,1.146,4.8487,0.0128,1.21,4.7184,5.676,1.0929,0.6985,1.1981]}

The musical numbers would be directed by an actor who was himself jazz music enthusiasts like Carson. So Carsons had a list of names of jazz musicians who would work with him in creating the look and feel of the show.\nIn 1964, a year before his untimely death in his sleep on March 4, Johnny Carsons and his wife, Lila, had purchased one of the historic, one - story buildings on Spring Street in New York City. This old stone building, which was built in 1852 on a lot that once belonged to John Jay, originally belonged to a man named Joseph Williams. He kept it empty for many years, and it was bought and renovated by Jack and Barbara Ford of the John Jay estate, who used it to run their business which included an art gallery.\nThe former home of Jack and Barbara Ford has been restored to its original, period features, and is now the location of what has become an annual event, the John Jay Street Fair. The carpenters who constructed this historic building and the house next down the street used salvaged wood from older buildings. During the restoration, they found a large amount of wood dating from the 1870\u2019s. They brought part of the wood with them, and some of it is still in place, including two original doors that they carefully brought back and used in the restoration of the building. They donated the other part to a museum to preserve, and a few can be found at several jazz clubs around the New York City Jazz Scene.\nJack Ford donated the house to New York State to become the National Historic Landmark. A plaque on the building commemorates Jack and Barbara Ford, and the other major donors : Art Tatum, John Coltrane, Sonny Terry, Max Roach. The plaque also reads,\u201d It belongs to New York State who has conserved and restored the home. They have the right and rightful legal ownership to the home.\u201d\nJohnny Carsons had already been working with the jazz community since 1962 as a writer on several TV shows. He had previously worked on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar and Johnny Mercer as a writer before joining Jack Paar\u2019s Showtime in 1965, where he created the original theme for the show, \u201c I Put a Spell On You.\u201d","token_len":513,"entropy":[10.2789,4.6375,3.3072,2.7059,7.0922,1.1316,7.5929,2.6711,0.5281,2.9297,7.3722,0.7012,3.2441,2.6385,1.746,2.0663,9.0954,2.1053,0.3269,2.9934,0.6448,0.0001,7.7802,1.5955,3.5803,5.5476,0.4522,1.1992,7.4349,1.5496,1.9701,2.3406,1.8332,1.3038,6.3284,5.2117,1.3125,6.0041,1.4894,4.0617,4.4819,2.4709,2.7866,4.5715,0.1517,3.0143,6.7626,8.3005,3.6409,1.289,6.8079,0.1032,4.3365,2.7818,1.938,1.8436,6.1966,4.8942,2.6124,7.4819,5.9849,6.517,0.9207,4.0546,12.786,5.9077,3.6731,2.2261,5.772,0.1074,2.9038,3.983,4.9067,0.7598,1.8656,1.2195,3.6721,1.4173,0.4353,2.9392,4.3949,0.9382,8.1096,1.0403,0.4925,0.3479,0.6959,0.3415,0.4663,1.3464,9.5972,3.9093,0.2918,3.6635,3.5229,1.3434,2.811,6.122,0.0172,0.0,0.1655,2.7788,3.3977,0.9711,4.5778,3.1385,3.4501,0.1776,4.9755,6.8119,0.0107,3.6864,1.1735,1.1097,1.0963,4.7096,3.5944,0.49,2.8776,4.6109,5.1844,0.1955,1.0855,7.0137,4.2143,4.5271,9.2232,7.3654,4.9677,2.1625,6.8232,0.5887,1.0223,2.7646,0.2668,0.3277,1.056,3.9512,6.7414,5.5483,0.4324,1.6415,2.299,1.5268,2.5513,0.68,1.258,4.0154,4.2146,1.9548,4.3446,2.1397,3.417,1.83,0.0013,3.694,5.5249,1.1719,7.6029,1.5279,0.0055,2.5786,3.6698,0.2186,4.5124,6.2394,1.0592,3.1645,5.7724,1.5897,6.4121,1.4629,3.003,0.104,1.2693,1.941,2.6957,1.1752,5.8166,2.9887,1.7328,1.4387,6.9399,3.8384,4.8938,4.2204,3.9515,2.3618,5.7264,0.2985,4.037,2.3294,1.3694,4.6359,0.8561,1.6529,4.9001,2.2834,3.047,6.5649,3.1393,4.6481,3.1399,0.6684,1.8868,1.4189,2.0705,6.6036,3.2702,0.4385,3.5453,0.468,0.0721,0.2357,4.22,1.0079,4.2382,1.3619,0.2393,1.0748,3.3432,8.3886,7.2009,1.4975,1.2811,2.5557,0.6567,2.5393,4.4144,0.3918,6.5115,3.5921,0.646,3.8837,2.6891,2.4664,2.0556,1.6311,3.9282,0.042,6.3525,4.1008,0.6809,1.6948,4.0018,7.33,0.0065,2.0002,5.2776,1.6351,2.6485,0.5477,3.6805,1.6561,5.5044,5.9785,8.294,2.3687,0.1751,3.6235,7.7937,0.0101,2.3958,1.3341,7.9487,1.4191,2.5528,5.4123,0.5704,4.4926,1.184,2.8774,4.3305,1.4631,3.5464,2.5261,0.0037,2.7006,5.9899,1.1644,0.5595,5.2918,16.9147,8.0791,3.4485,1.208,2.395,5.3245,8.0392,0.0218,0.7672,0.9093,4.2811,0.0326,1.84,0.7552,4.5585,0.6451,1.1402,3.2319,1.1962,1.4547,2.0514,1.5531,3.421,5.0708,3.9015,4.6181,1.7046,4.3922,7.6065,6.3377,0.8642,3.2118,2.5243,2.5582,0.7521,2.4992,2.933,0.2886,1.602,0.2363,3.1034,7.0538,1.3498,4.8703,0.9374,1.6708,2.3067,2.1676,3.6423,2.6008,2.2747,0.7681,3.8083,3.2131,7.7503,2.5788,1.9806,2.1853,6.8466,10.3307,1.487,1.2249,0.4768,5.3237,0.0447,1.317,9.1052,2.1152,0.3152,0.6067,5.2591,3.6782,5.4716,1.1053,4.0357,0.5472,5.6505,0.1388,2.3202,6.2785,4.5444,1.1597,4.6856,2.1711,0.2538,0.0803,1.3203,4.1724,2.9529,2.0924,0.1662,2.7625,2.8817,0.1326,4.4305,2.0365,0.1319,0.2885,2.5746,1.223,1.6319,4.9097,6.061,4.5555,10.7197,7.1462,6.7159,4.4625,0.778,3.0935,6.5824,0.4462,0.0016,0.395,6.8735,7.8198,0.3145,7.2601,6.0902,1.065,3.6145,1.7989,3.6231,1.8729,2.7503,1.1544,12.8839,7.411,6.9352,7.3028,0.0504,6.5898,0.0729,0.7511,6.7462,3.5871,8.1179,0.0082,1.5411,1.5191,0.9981,3.8311,1.622,5.0875,2.4735,4.5166,2.0203,4.4274,6.4876,6.1493,3.8974,2.4347,3.2253,3.0059,1.0951,7.8656,0.9279,0.5973,4.6377,1.4607,0.0012,3.0203,4.0932,2.2323,2.3863,1.4147,1.9534,7.2616,2.2588,3.583,3.3711,4.0882,0.9186,3.7407,3.2377,4.7119,4.1221,0.6907,1.7024,0.8188,1.5041,4.3704,0.8776,1.4309,2.8917,0.5636,0.0015,1.1733,6.1069,7.5264,0.1317,1.2606,4.388,10.2433,3.1267,1.6696,1.352,4.6319,2.6733,4.8282,3.5984,0.0006,10.1318,3.4288,1.7876,10.5126,2.7132,3.2739,2.5484,2.6342,0.16,4.7648,1.1323,3.6215,5.1967,2.8042,0.7774,0.5412,2.2792,6.442,4.5422,5.651,8.1315,2.4019,3.9136,2.3352,0.7188,1.2488,5.8426,1.0166]}

It","text":"Option C is a concept in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the championship in exchange for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It is possible that all of the participants will be eligible to return to another event in the same year or in an alternate year. This concept would make it possible for new champions to become X-division champions.\nIn this match, the winner would have the TNA World X Division Championship belt and retain the opportunity to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at a future D X pay-per-view. This option would not guarantee X-division or heavyweight championships in the year.\nSo now there's just two options for who will get the belt the year that a TNA World X Division Championship event would be held.\nThe concept is similar to the original X Division Invitational Match, but with the current champion not receiving a title (i.e., a no-title match) as opposed to an all-around title (i.e., a title match ) for the TNA World X Division Championship. This is because the current champion already has the TNA World X Division Championship belt and it is not being changed.\nSo it will be the winner of that match. However, with the TNA World X Division Championship at stake, it will be decided by a simple majority vote. This will be decided in the same way as the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, which goes to the winner of an all-around title match.\nThis option was created to allow current X Division World Heavyweight Champs to earn a X Division World Title match at a future X Division World title event.\nIn this case, the X Division World Heavyweight Championship would have to be declared vacant at the annual Destination X. However, there would be no reason for the title to be declared vacant because it would never be vacated because of it having been won by anyone (i.e., it's a gold medal) and no one wants it to be taken away from him because another person wants to earn it.\nHowever, before vacating the title, the person who holds it would voluntarily agree to have it vacated and would participate in an All Elite Wrestling event with some other person as the champ in exchange for receiving the X Division World Title belt.\nAnother X Division World Heavyweight Championship option would be for the person to receive the X Division World Title belt and then decide to vacate it in return for getting a World Heavyweight Title belt.","token_len":513,"entropy":[7.6981,5.5521,2.5498,7.403,2.1893,2.1785,1.8593,5.7137,8.4957,9.3275,7.6276,4.338,8.5134,7.4838,0.0008,1.8268,5.032,3.3984,3.0834,0.0082,1.069,7.7188,5.0594,3.9448,2.2227,0.0012,1.0918,4.7153,4.0351,4.7131,4.1244,0.0034,8.4778,3.9666,2.4376,0.4966,3.6927,0.9247,3.6376,0.8187,5.8895,1.7842,0.5356,4.8735,2.6024,1.3813,3.924,0.5714,4.1236,0.3433,6.5384,3.0962,2.4847,0.7773,3.7376,0.9312,4.1153,3.0785,3.5846,0.742,1.1763,1.0192,3.5439,4.5874,3.7468,4.0449,1.2414,1.0002,0.4352,5.6024,3.9652,0.2685,4.493,4.7458,4.3753,5.9704,0.5201,2.0358,0.726,14.2978,3.6406,7.0463,0.4449,1.2919,2.1233,3.1665,2.9812,1.1622,6.3081,0.0541,0.3386,6.9435,0.618,1.9084,4.3388,1.6867,6.274,0.7906,4.7886,0.0615,2.9991,1.0654,2.1219,0.0016,0.3914,0.1276,0.0017,0.237,2.941,2.369,2.6673,6.3075,8.75,10.2394,0.1078,0.0044,0.0011,0.0125,1.0748,2.6886,4.7432,0.9054,2.7564,5.1109,4.4448,0.4844,0.1141,5.4727,7.3431,2.7043,3.4471,0.7832,5.3779,3.4607,0.8088,6.8597,4.8844,3.8767,2.041,4.6803,3.0037,2.3114,1.7456,4.2509,2.0956,2.9634,1.3501,3.4903,7.0586,3.3556,4.5294,4.8444,2.6533,0.0049,0.0941,3.4906,1.1967,2.6397,4.0981,4.0207,0.8151,0.3992,0.791,1.4922,1.5327,8.6617,1.449,3.4511,0.0577,1.0225,4.5673,2.8969,1.06,7.0707,0.041,4.9517,1.636,1.9464,1.6669,1.6202,5.5008,2.1914,4.2542,4.2992,1.1513,2.3799,5.8263,4.1229,0.0014,0.0005,1.1054,2.966,6.3301,0.5231,0.5873,1.3229,1.6062,3.0766,3.6791,0.0011,3.3307,4.5008,0.0875,5.1588,1.6223,2.4592,0.5261,0.0006,0.001,0.0173,0.5131,2.1524,1.0815,9.715,3.5426,0.721,3.0241,0.0146,0.0808,2.5847,0.2626,0.6656,0.7941,2.4839,2.0143,2.2714,1.1111,1.7857,0.6234,5.4582,0.6512,1.1907,1.7251,0.003,0.0646,2.1062,0.3233,0.1684,0.3133,1.0009,4.361,1.2761,1.5494,5.4181,6.447,1.445,1.0061,2.8902,4.0264,4.0725,0.6462,3.2677,2.482,0.2532,3.0414,1.4397,2.618,3.4554,0.0347,4.6148,0.7016,2.5803,0.0021,0.0338,0.7419,0.2212,0.0939,4.5382,2.733,0.4643,2.1126,1.9795,0.5866,3.2693,1.5203,1.7579,4.4918,0.5722,0.2651,1.1054,2.3932,2.7189,2.0973,3.7318,2.7671,1.1727,4.4474,0.6816,0.9668,0.5393,3.6648,0.0029,0.0919,0.3468,0.0047,0.2145,1.8069,2.4409,5.7481,0.1766,0.564,1.2495,0.3731,4.6444,1.7242,0.0074,0.4445,0.6093,0.8312,0.51,0.6369,2.4933,4.1641,4.376,3.8226,1.3973,1.7225,5.861,2.4145,0.5634,4.8243,0.249,0.2464,6.4572,0.0638,1.1091,5.0389,1.6077,5.5151,1.4325,3.3703,1.8399,2.6112,1.8063,1.431,0.6939,2.2253,3.2292,1.7349,4.8372,0.6165,0.4847,1.3489,3.214,1.5591,2.4539,0.0789,0.8044,3.4945,0.1701,0.6652,0.5553,0.0042,0.7252,0.8093,3.3352,1.3821,0.409,6.4117,3.993,2.2394,0.579,8.1974,1.4464,0.1178,4.7586,2.5155,0.0093,3.2418,1.9955,0.7125,1.0573,4.2678,1.0178,0.9744,5.0271,1.0822,0.6266,2.6586,0.6126,3.7436,2.2171,0.662,4.538,0.7741,4.1129,4.5804,1.1176,5.8907,4.0865,1.3327,3.564,1.14,5.6009,5.3597,1.5756,0.0011,0.001,0.0501,3.3566,3.5521,2.4727,7.6425,0.6755,3.6613,2.7612,3.7048,1.7972,5.7271,2.2538,0.7458,0.4141,4.751,0.8278,1.3004,4.1067,2.934,7.4335,4.2171,3.0778,2.1603,5.9091,1.4126,0.5504,0.5998,3.7588,0.0138,6.8268,6.6214,0.0104,0.258,0.7536,0.5817,0.9223,5.6768,1.0947,3.9991,2.6155,1.0894,8.2461,4.6269,0.0849,4.4524,1.5951,1.8379,2.3569,2.801,6.8163,0.1023,2.749,4.8464,12.4222,5.5584,2.2573,3.5747,6.0112,1.9875,2.3113,3.4378,1.9382,6.6939,3.5456,2.5207,0.0331,6.1912,0.9433,3.2292,0.2584,0.1228,0.5819,2.5516,0.4047,0.659,6.249,5.3984,0.4524,0.1861,2.0742,0.0019,0.7017,5.2863,0.8309,0.2738,1.9922,0.9784,3.8854,1.5876,3.6065,0.7902,1.7513,0.1882,0.0561,1.5182,0.8859,1.9274,2.8845,4.799,1.4504,1.7154,0.0002,1.1532,2.7716,4.2184,0.0997,4.2954,1.4812,4.8905,0.757,0.0037,1.3977,2.9056,0.612]}

Bonds is the first player in the thirty @ years of the MLB to hold a multi - million dollar contract and earn. $25 million in salaries in the span of just three seasons. Bonds has had very positive financial interests in the past, such as buying a home on the outskirts of Los Angeles but did not realize he had bought a home in the suburbs of Denver.\nPuerto Rican sports star Javier Ortiz was not allowed to enter the United States on Thursday, after he was pulled over after a stroll with his dog in a neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California. Ortiz was told by an immigration officer he was not allowed to enter because the dog was not licensed. He asked the man to explain the reason he was not allowed to enter and that the dog could be brought to a government office to receive his license. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he refused to come with the dog and that they needed to take him. He refused to come inside the police car and he was stopped by law enforcement. A spokesperson for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said they would investigate the claims of discrimination. Ortiz said on Twitter that he is trying to understand the reason why he does not have a lawful status in the United States and that his family had not received any communication by the Department of Homeland Security. They were not allowed to bring him to the San Clemente Police Department, with which he has had a good relation in the last years.\nHe was trying to understand why they did not authorize his entrance. The Los Angeles City Attorney said there was no basis for deporting Javier Ortiz. The attorney said on the radio station The Signal : \"The city of Los Angeles had nothing to do with the deportation; it had nothing to do with the charges that were levied against him. \" Ortiz added that his mother had not received the formal communication from DHS, although he stated that his family received a call from them to tell them that he couldn't get into the United States. He said that with the lack of communication from the U.S., they do not know the reason. I can't tell you the reason, but there are a lot of things in the media that can be taken out of context. Ortiz also reiterated his intention to continue his career in MLB. And with respect to his decision to be involved with the Democratic presidential campaign, he said he would do whatever was best to have the country prosper without discrimination.","token_len":513,"entropy":[10.7303,11.3141,1.3826,0.9353,9.1272,4.4788,0.172,1.8563,4.216,7.8494,0.01,0.1408,7.2401,2.939,4.4091,1.4515,3.4775,10.3774,8.1654,6.4095,3.7838,1.9991,3.17,1.9309,1.7609,1.8605,0.8471,3.6249,3.3629,3.3139,2.39,1.6269,1.4946,1.3334,11.4841,14.2088,8.4717,1.456,3.0744,2.1518,6.0946,4.1325,0.8776,4.322,9.0528,6.0277,0.8594,2.6117,3.2204,5.8795,7.528,5.6286,3.7906,0.8926,2.2554,5.5072,2.9776,1.8096,6.1307,0.057,3.5021,2.4647,1.2616,0.7237,2.8132,2.0644,3.9091,5.4896,3.0015,4.6056,7.729,0.8571,0.8628,3.8664,1.6586,3.7434,0.0093,4.0717,1.482,3.6432,3.7404,1.3187,3.9925,0.0125,2.8558,0.011,4.7885,4.6261,0.0952,4.1842,1.8838,2.1836,5.1531,0.9821,0.541,1.3303,1.8233,3.1198,1.3853,6.2959,0.8652,2.4363,6.5388,5.3195,0.1,1.3967,4.9673,3.4943,4.3948,6.0935,2.6656,4.76,4.1333,0.155,3.4183,0.3653,3.3614,0.0145,3.4622,5.3929,1.7633,3.6762,1.9658,1.0755,5.0985,1.5071,3.7921,2.5135,12.875,4.7968,0.6352,4.749,1.9129,2.4952,5.0921,2.5623,7.0142,0.0145,1.3416,0.4415,0.3943,1.4814,1.251,5.3332,1.0774,2.921,4.6383,1.0629,2.4439,1.0787,1.8474,0.9536,0.3032,0.6441,3.161,3.1056,1.8084,1.0992,2.3649,5.4027,2.2182,2.6631,5.2637,1.6803,6.032,1.4846,3.8395,1.9324,2.8217,3.1509,0.4369,1.915,0.0974,0.4273,0.3732,2.4142,3.4914,1.9768,0.7627,4.0828,2.1059,4.5394,1.1155,2.9385,6.0506,4.0416,2.8043,4.137,3.0068,3.5414,0.3101,1.7299,7.7524,0.0099,3.1744,0.1103,0.0967,2.3213,3.2894,3.9375,0.5994,3.9303,3.5894,0.8877,0.5583,1.3521,2.151,2.9577,5.3147,0.4763,3.5593,1.1771,5.0467,3.1829,4.1135,0.6928,2.0428,5.9052,1.4322,3.6506,3.0,1.3466,4.2882,0.4672,3.7132,1.1819,4.9708,0.0216,1.4086,4.0813,4.5705,0.2862,6.0174,1.0721,2.5915,0.0596,0.0009,0.0124,1.2659,2.8522,2.2509,3.0691,1.2271,6.3234,2.3492,6.3596,1.529,1.7764,2.9301,4.5299,1.4405,0.5844,0.4522,2.4052,4.8914,0.0807,4.0293,2.3068,2.9207,1.292,0.7325,6.2344,0.0129,1.28,1.0472,7.2286,3.3563,0.7337,0.1116,0.4625,0.0012,2.063,1.4536,2.6689,3.6523,4.3063,3.159,3.0884,1.5159,5.2452,5.2792,1.3826,3.2648,0.0981,0.5054,0.002,1.3878,6.1598,3.3603,2.2305,3.6777,0.2357,3.9834,1.2371,1.4164,0.6116,6.0929,5.6704,0.0008,2.5341,0.1739,2.3743,6.7537,2.513,0.7651,1.9976,2.7722,1.6541,3.3566,9.2971,3.7884,0.4275,3.4299,5.8672,0.2449,1.3709,5.277,2.2182,6.1857,0.0287,4.0106,0.5235,3.348,1.646,0.0108,8.4452,1.7423,4.6915,2.1197,2.8908,3.2544,0.0056,3.9089,0.9014,2.9303,3.9842,1.0159,0.7878,4.4236,0.5836,8.2979,0.0167,7.111,0.7435,1.0485,2.0748,4.7225,1.379,5.157,3.496,4.8862,2.3452,5.5574,8.5539,6.7294,0.496,2.7497,3.0513,1.6077,0.2106,0.0056,3.9502,4.6671,0.1899,0.0514,0.0257,1.6448,3.8455,6.1454,1.5416,3.1866,1.0651,0.0584,0.0061,0.0105,0.9543,6.6025,2.6137,1.0415,4.6078,0.1639,0.7705,1.1318,3.7529,6.0452,5.0555,0.6548,2.6314,4.4481,2.0733,2.8645,2.2244,3.4122,6.6824,5.2573,1.1965,3.6249,2.6534,4.6913,1.5217,4.8888,0.9508,2.3499,2.941,3.4647,1.6087,3.048,0.5252,3.5091,4.4328,3.3329,0.4472,1.2479,1.0803,6.2287,0.0005,3.2541,1.7978,0.2457,0.7683,0.0011,0.6459,2.4449,1.0919,1.2585,6.7627,1.2216,4.098,0.0065,1.662,1.613,1.2782,3.3611,0.0034,0.0013,2.8201,2.3066,5.0963,0.104,2.6571,3.2091,1.5232,3.2667,6.3484,3.5984,1.0386,3.1515,0.137,2.3827,1.1739,2.3849,0.4436,3.7056,2.0627,2.0094,0.667,0.0229,1.8153,3.3269,1.1244,3.785,0.6466,3.6188,1.5127,3.1892,1.7081,0.1284,0.0915,1.3449,4.2629,4.1685,6.6198,1.6833,4.3311,0.1733,3.5105,1.3674,1.3029,1.0689,4.3866,1.2146,6.3215,4.8549,4.77,0.0805,1.624,3.5272,0.4184,4.0331,5.8691,1.7388,0.6795,8.4091,5.1828,1.625,0.4489,0.8869,0.9282,1.7093,2.3436,3.0555,3.2065,3.0929,2.6661,4.2806,5.5156,1.3977,4.6569,6.4455,4.3571,4.6425,0.8896]}

'' But the trial is here carried on, and completed, at Bermuda, the home seat of the accused.\nIn this case he was there for the purpose of a voyage to sea, and the trial was therefore held there.\nIt so happened that the defendant had a considerable property in Bermuda, and an opinion was expressed, that the evidence of the agent in the prosecution was not competent to convict him in the absent States.\nThe judge who disposed of this matter said at the trial that it was right to hear counsel for the defence, and to see the witnesses, when the trial took place in Bermuda, and not for him, as the judge, to pass his opinion upon any matter that might have taken place in the courts of the defendant's principal place of business.\nIn the present case counsel applied for the release of the prisoner on bail.\nThe application was declined by the court, which had no authority to refuse to grant bail.\nUpon his coming back to the United States, he applied to his attorney for a certificate from the court, stating that he had been convicted of felony in Bermuda, and the request was also refused.\nIn his appeal to this court, he states that the evidence of the witness was competent to convict him, and the question is, whether the proof of the prisoner in the court at Bermuda was sufficient to convict him in this court.\nIf the court could have given his evidence on the witness' testimony in Bermuda, that it did not render the trial null and void, they could not withhold it in this court with just view.\nThe result of the proceeding in these courts is that the charge has only passed for that place, and that the prisoner has been convicted in this court on this evidence.\nAnd if the prisoner be released on bail, he will have to appear as charged and convicted before the

I understand this was a very complex event and not sure when exactly the last memorial was put up. Is anyone able to comment?Many thanks.\nI believe the memorials were put up in the church in Cumbria. If anything could be helpful please let me know.\nThankyou, that is very helpful. I have a couple of links to pictures of the memorial now. Thankyou again.\nHi,I do not recall the stone in the bottom of the church being removed,it may have been moved by wind. I did however notice the words 'for the loss of the ships the ships' were cut into the side of a wall behind the altar. I think the stones in the church were removed by those concerned with the church itself.\nAt a later date a local couple may have made memorials.They were located in what is now the car park attached to the church. I took a photo of the top stone a few years ago but unfortunately it has gone now.\nThe inscription above the memorial is on the right hand side when you view the memorial from the entrance of the church.\nI seem to remember all three ships being lost in the Windermere - one was an Edwardian passenger ship, the other two were a large cargo ship. I only saw the glass in one of the windows on the east end of the church.\nI believe the church is called St Peter,Martindale - it has a large clock tower and a white bell on the top of the tower ( just outside of the churchyard ) it is believed that the ships were all lost in the ice there.\nThere was a small plaque outside the church at the foot of the slope before the churchyard in memory of the ships\"\nAs far as I am aware they were all buried at the bottom of the Windermere Ledges or in the churchyard.","token_len":515,"entropy":[5.9277,1.8074,3.2425,4.822,9.6082,2.1538,1.3087,11.8942,0.4015,6.5557,0.9648,0.5855,8.3445,5.651,1.4273,1.5454,8.1158,15.2043,10.0649,4.3176,8.4098,2.9193,1.9541,1.2652,6.4215,3.0468,0.8169,4.3061,7.8181,5.8758,0.0017,2.0687,6.2628,1.9783,0.0037,1.9337,4.6285,1.3863,5.2893,3.9068,0.0699,6.1448,8.4878,0.5252,0.0001,0.7166,6.4147,5.9326,1.4595,4.6108,3.9645,2.2979,4.8233,0.0741,3.1305,3.8305,4.0797,6.401,12.7234,4.677,1.2675,0.7614,1.6002,2.2723,6.8401,4.318,1.1591,3.2677,1.4566,2.1478,6.4965,0.0506,0.5226,0.2322,2.8709,1.1936,3.969,1.3454,0.6512,0.7335,0.7115,3.2721,15.4875,0.0141,0.0048,1.6113,6.6636,4.8281,0.7166,3.0889,3.9192,2.7177,3.3698,2.1732,1.2564,2.0824,5.5046,0.5187,2.4418,1.3479,1.5548,1.8652,1.108,4.1759,0.4654,2.6428,4.0785,5.5339,4.1653,6.5479,2.4604,10.4496,2.2438,1.7404,4.743,3.9629,0.5817,1.3244,1.7232,2.8125,3.278,8.7648,6.9003,7.5577,0.659,4.2252,2.6246,4.1398,0.0147,0.0016,4.1267,2.7489,0.2022,1.7614,2.5674,4.5852,3.2448,2.3558,1.7291,2.8642,4.3935,3.9982,1.5563,4.1733,6.9335,4.2222,4.4437,1.7557,4.4508,4.6199,0.7542,3.6835,0.4465,1.2388,4.3717,3.8989,3.0781,0.0286,3.9494,2.4,8.2161,0.5495,2.765,2.1972,3.031,4.3905,1.6154,2.7194,2.4033,1.7728,1.6467,0.1058,1.5772,1.3656,1.6817,3.2656,1.803,0.0186,0.0016,2.8612,4.1983,4.6199,5.2128,0.6252,6.3583,3.4908,1.4279,0.0337,0.0019,0.5157,1.1858,4.0845,4.9715,2.1884,8.3568,1.2269,2.854,2.0901,0.6802,2.4833,2.4607,2.5481,3.5687,0.3597,5.5351,1.1248,5.3629,1.0333,0.5109,0.9477,7.2384,1.1348,4.8926,3.0784,3.0505,1.3599,0.7707,4.9063,1.5599,3.0659,4.7706,1.048,5.0344,1.8479,6.0908,3.4375,1.0213,7.5187,1.2386,0.2186,1.0661,3.5891,2.6129,1.8628,7.2399,3.2066,0.5001,0.2294,2.783,2.9096,5.0683,1.7216,1.888,3.8113,4.7066,2.5474,1.934,4.9277,3.0828,5.5092,1.7717,5.1641,0.1536,1.9517,4.1086,6.6837,4.3828,3.607,3.4207,5.7245,2.7821,0.4774,5.2107,0.3749,3.6041,4.2106,5.3684,0.3522,3.3324,0.8815,1.816,2.9264,1.809,2.6689,3.7109,0.3711,1.0119,1.2674,2.0145,2.3456,7.0074,8.1923,3.5527,0.8127,2.9236,5.1893,0.6666,1.6067,6.3502,4.1049,2.2567,0.5256,3.5423,4.9602,6.0676,6.0348,0.384,3.8927,6.2395,0.3791,4.3268,5.9312,1.9285,4.7535,1.064,5.81,0.8392,0.2421,2.1829,7.8823,0.5431,9.211,0.1448,0.4576,0.9175,0.8914,2.182,5.8319,1.7264,2.4453,0.5191,1.0117,6.8755,4.413,6.4538,0.714,1.2204,0.3124,3.7814,5.284,1.6137,2.1718,4.2746,4.0451,1.0233,1.5938,3.2063,5.1058,5.0031,1.5038,3.5737,1.8489,3.7199,0.6474,3.0077,2.745,0.127,7.6739,2.1613,4.3859,0.7641,3.941,3.3341,0.5563,6.5378,2.0749,0.0994,0.8495,0.5115,1.5863,1.6999,7.85,0.1184,0.9068,5.932,1.6319,0.5076,2.3426,2.9624,1.736,0.9365,8.2367,0.0339,0.0018,5.8094,3.684,3.1912,5.2345,6.7107,1.3157,7.7694,0.8658,1.31,1.0654,0.352,2.5268,0.6425,2.2054,6.6502,6.801,0.7777,1.343,2.0489,6.1048,2.5611,1.4852,6.1522,3.0105,2.615,0.6118,0.2455,2.5425,3.3742,0.4143,2.7399,0.6438,0.3532,0.3623,0.1675,0.9357,1.3635,1.3951,3.1384,1.1014,4.0016,2.5999,5.412,1.2484,0.7008,2.9229,2.0803,0.0054,0.0025,3.7925,2.7384,2.6531,1.4781,2.8285,8.5118,1.1036,2.3655,1.5919,5.358,6.0166,3.1422,0.6133,2.1842,1.1809,0.3333,1.2876,4.9942,8.7468,3.9054,2.0352,0.2329,1.1876,7.0063,2.4169,4.3247,1.1674,3.6541,1.8719,1.1564,4.1285,0.658,4.3828,2.2981,1.2741,0.6307,7.5298,6.7807,0.9244,1.1935,3.9101,2.2758,0.9004,3.3151,2.126,3.7518,0.5159,0.2089,3.4928,0.4581,4.0555,0.0203,0.1932,7.7386,6.1514,0.4556,3.9818,3.8847,4.3268,6.1697,0.0324,0.7022,2.6509,10.9597,1.7117,4.8554,2.1754,0.0176,0.2821,2.5391,0.3967,4.3472,1.3639,1.709,5.4645,2.7616,1.035,3.4385,0.1311,0.3929,5.8585,0.0033,0.0031,13.5849,1.3032,4.809,2.6797,0.7455,2.0618,0.8102,1.0226]}

In that game he earned his first major league hit with a double in the first inning. The next day in another game, he hit a home run, earning his first career single home run.  Stein was credited with the opening and third runs batted in in the same game. In that season, Stein hit.270 (34-for-113) with 10 doubles, 2 triples and 6 home runs; his 5 RBI's were on-base percentage at.364.\nStein batted.267 (57-for-185) with 4 doubles, 5 triples and 11 home runs in 1981.

The Rangers lost in the 1983 World Series, 1 game to the Boston Red Sox.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nOn August 21, 1983, Stein was traded to the Dallas Cowboys along with Jerry Douglas, Steve Mullen, Brian Giles, Bruce Mcknight and a 1981 first-round draft pick in exchange for Billy Bartlett.  This was made possible when the Rangers cut Bartlett, and Texas then turned to Stein to replace him. He spent some time with the Buffalo Bisons in 1984 to earn his playing time with the Rangers. This time he was an everyday player at third base. His hitting performance came in spades.  Stein hit.350, with 22 doubles, 5 triples, 7 home runs and 60 RBI's in an undefeated season for the Rangers. However, while in Texas, he injured his elbow and was forced to retire from playing baseball on July 1, 1986.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nAt the time of his retirement, he was a five-time All-Star.

In the first part of qualifying, at 2 : 30 p.m, Mr. J. Glover and Mr. J. D. MacAlister completed a lap of 1 2, 1 5, and 1 5 minutes in running, all in first gear and not very far off the mean time. The two had to be withdrawn from the rest of the day's work for some mechanical trouble, so that only four and a half hours were allowed to the second part of the qualifying.\nThis was a little later, being 5 p.m. The time allowed for each rider to complete a lap in the three sessions of the day was between 6 and 8 minutes.\nIn the third of the three sessions the second drive was finished at 6 minutes 17 seconds.\nThis is the best time attained by any member of the present team during the season.\nIt was the result of much hard work by the driver and engineer, and, except for that difficulty in starting which was not noticed at the earlier part of the season, he is in fair position, and quite prepared for his work when the championship is opened as soon as possible.\n\" On Sunday afternoon some very good riders from other countries were present, the most important being Mr. Edward Acheson ( United States ), who did two sessions of the two-drive type.\nHis runs proved very impressive.\nHe does a very fine job of the first and sometimes almost perfect work of the second drive.\nIn the second session he finished his runs of 6 and 8 minutes 2 second, and in the third of 6 minutes 9 seconds.\n\" At 4 p.m. there was a \" free-fall race \" for men and women.\nThe men took up their places on the rails, while the women waited to be drawn.\nThe riders who could make the race were taken by Mr. J. Glover through the course so that they could be \" fitted \" for a particular fall.\nThey then had to be \" fitted \" again and had to \" take hold \" and \" stop \" if no rider got through on the other side.\nThe riders who got through had to \" swing \" on to the other rail immediately, and a good race was won by the rider who could get through first and get the next one to stop after him.\nThe judges were Messrs. J. Glover and J. Acheson.\n\n","token_len":517,"entropy":[7.6485,11.5542,0.0575,2.9615,4.2129,2.4306,8.7067,3.6255,3.7331,0.5672,2.6128,4.3365,3.579,2.2097,7.3971,1.8894,2.3732,5.1698,9.6381,7.2345,1.6661,6.0849,5.0406,3.651,3.0888,0.5071,2.7566,1.2889,5.3504,0.3725,3.2685,1.0652,1.979,4.0431,0.9609,2.0256,0.2624,5.7369,4.0613,8.6827,5.541,3.2426,0.0043,0.0027,6.5524,8.0757,0.0219,5.2404,1.0514,10.3246,2.8166,0.8102,0.0004,3.0723,0.0688,4.5403,0.6823,5.9053,6.9567,1.2801,4.1126,2.1504,3.8873,0.6375,3.4968,4.9005,4.6446,5.385,4.4769,0.817,1.7883,0.6425,2.6372,3.3392,1.7113,7.4007,3.1424,5.2231,2.3228,5.6039,3.9022,2.8201,4.6404,6.9151,3.29,2.9162,0.8576,6.1781,2.5476,1.2056,1.5731,3.6902,7.2274,2.0191,2.3753,6.7976,1.4501,0.4123,6.6518,0.0898,0.08,4.7814,1.9613,4.4143,3.0812,4.8429,6.3259,4.3862,1.6709,2.9956,0.9226,5.1116,3.9723,5.3937,0.7997,0.0094,1.4667,1.5013,3.219,1.1771,4.0644,4.9861,1.905,0.5694,0.6064,2.4701,1.7818,1.9955,10.4623,1.8456,1.863,5.1271,4.7024,2.4322,7.5787,5.2307,2.6329,0.0016,0.0004,0.5029,3.2411,5.1705,4.747,1.117,3.0546,5.1402,0.8434,1.7882,1.9637,0.8034,2.9346,1.2549,5.0274,5.1754,2.8933,1.5778,3.355,0.8099,5.3608,2.9471,1.3542,1.2645,2.6158,0.9194,1.7993,2.7566,0.3573,2.0147,5.8785,0.6547,1.7305,1.3149,4.2874,4.4795,8.468,1.3121,5.1152,2.4993,2.3466,6.6407,7.5963,0.3329,1.6771,1.8378,3.1203,3.3635,1.1179,5.3627,1.3871,10.063,1.03,1.5966,5.0524,0.0683,0.2516,5.726,1.8625,3.5246,0.8028,4.9825,0.8019,0.8212,3.9037,0.8238,2.2926,5.3741,0.0648,5.7638,4.4502,0.0757,1.612,1.1118,4.5161,1.8174,3.8782,1.5809,1.9897,5.2747,7.005,0.4711,4.1339,7.815,1.8905,5.329,6.8891,2.0836,3.1362,4.5835,2.8258,0.5465,6.2345,3.1478,0.129,0.2049,2.2319,0.0881,4.7796,4.0949,4.4572,6.5274,5.3146,4.4565,1.7731,5.893,5.1863,1.4338,3.0884,5.7483,5.3194,1.8929,6.3026,1.1691,6.0346,6.0148,2.1445,0.0064,0.5912,0.2315,0.399,4.3941,9.4457,3.5439,3.2411,7.2243,4.1913,2.8493,3.2829,3.4828,4.8955,3.0694,2.8942,3.1066,1.6354,4.9174,3.0881,2.246,0.8859,1.7268,0.0026,5.9843,4.6622,5.9271,0.0145,3.3948,10.8063,0.4555,1.9213,1.0659,4.7078,5.1811,4.5671,1.5501,1.8627,4.1082,1.3625,6.3575,6.3915,1.496,1.9035,5.3375,9.1025,5.5271,1.871,3.869,1.6405,2.1334,2.1837,7.1261,2.5755,1.9833,4.259,0.1626,1.5527,3.8632,4.1686,3.1061,8.3628,8.1418,1.92,4.2909,2.1945,0.676,0.3583,2.1526,0.7907,0.8257,3.2802,0.6556,1.2376,2.926,1.4574,3.3707,3.4837,5.3166,3.1839,4.1001,1.2204,1.7336,0.5743,7.3105,6.4517,2.2772,1.7009,1.6422,0.1939,0.3916,3.1857,4.8637,1.3933,3.5007,0.3701,1.2631,0.4594,3.568,3.8997,3.5765,2.0825,0.0007,0.0006,0.3789,4.3298,0.6721,0.702,6.914,8.0699,2.8606,2.6301,6.1009,1.675,3.8056,6.5088,2.1269,0.3921,1.8506,0.8133,1.6899,4.4234,3.6099,4.0726,2.2711,3.8323,2.297,0.2043,9.2257,1.3904,3.1492,0.222,0.0968,5.6557,2.7216,1.8352,5.9652,2.5699,0.45,1.4141,4.4452,3.4393,4.507,4.0022,1.4927,2.5786,1.2392,5.6679,3.1609,6.1853,0.0026,3.1203,0.064,0.8018,6.0062,0.7767,4.2295,7.0035,0.4667,0.9205,0.3539,2.7174,5.5373,6.9616,2.1436,1.7632,3.001,5.9619,9.2234,1.0045,0.2806,3.2491,3.8355,3.1658,0.6519,2.2514,3.1243,1.9173,0.8501,3.8355,3.157,4.922,0.2186,3.6233,4.1228,7.1166,2.789,3.9187,1.7886,5.3993,0.4011,5.9121,5.7392,3.7373,4.4163,4.353,4.7064,0.833,3.2104,0.3061,0.7938,0.2152,1.7778,2.9311,1.5656,4.3455,0.3283,3.1642,0.1697,2.4193,8.4643,1.8645,3.287,3.5523,0.4204,2.0601,5.3585,7.2102,1.6645,1.1508,4.952,4.2225,4.2771,1.0973,2.6801,2.2173,1.709,3.763,0.3031,2.5075,3.1386,0.4026,5.1883,2.5351,3.1249,2.7649,4.1654,2.5573,3.572,4.6255,4.7322,3.0107,0.2503,0.2001,1.5106,6.4256,2.2152,11.2744,0.016,0.0163,2.8908,0.032,1.96,0.6156,1.7031,0.0059,4.0419,0.0548,0.0008,1.3185,5.474]}

A compromise was reached in the end and George Allenby received the VC for the Normandy Campaign on December 5th, 1945 after a formal presentation by the then King George VI, as well as being awarded the DSO on July 9th, 1944.\nAllenby had taken up the command of the British forces in Egypt in 1941 after the original plans to invade Palestine had run into difficulties. From 1942 onwards the British started a period of increasing preparations for a land invasion of Palestine with Allenby being tasked with securing and defending the Suez Canal, an area of vital importance both militarily and politically to the British and the British colonial empire. On June 3rd, 1943 the Royal Army Medical Corps established one of the largest military hospitals in the British Empire, the General Hospital near Alexandria.\nIn addition to this he also supervised the construction of the Suez Canal during the later stages of the campaign and was instrumental in ensuring that the Canal was completed by December 1943. General Allenby was also responsible for the creation of the Egyptian Civil Administration.\nHis career was brought to an abrupt end with the death of King Edward VIII in November 1936, who abdicated his throne and became King George VI. When the British Parliament refused to recognize the new monarch, a political crisis was unleashed which was dealt with militarily in 1944, but although Allenby supported King George this caused his position with the British public to deteriorate and he was forced to resign his position in late - - December 1944. However, when the King died on January 7th, 1952 and the new monarch was crowned in April 1950, then Lieutenant Colonel Allenby resumed his duties as General Officer Commanding in Chief Middle East Command ( which covered all the Middle East countries ) and received the DSO as well as the medal on that occasion.","token_len":517,"entropy":[11.9552,4.2143,8.26,0.8454,8.0845,3.8909,0.3847,0.8115,9.158,10.1203,9.5388,2.9745,8.3485,4.9661,9.9777,4.5302,10.8751,3.039,9.986,10.2537,2.0004,6.0254,0.9396,4.8808,2.3914,3.0947,3.4407,11.9287,0.0501,1.6193,1.0291,3.3376,7.2501,2.775,5.2387,0.2469,1.489,2.5964,11.5628,2.1969,9.3427,4.2053,0.8373,4.3878,2.5463,2.616,7.9363,7.7705,1.148,6.571,5.9696,5.9872,6.0822,3.963,4.2764,8.7932,1.8456,1.2357,5.8169,0.5619,3.8318,0.0022,0.7259,4.7918,3.8275,1.7516,9.1092,4.67,1.0516,2.9448,0.1596,0.8116,7.0494,0.518,6.2631,1.6775,1.6068,4.1499,1.0437,1.8377,1.3084,2.3004,0.4194,3.642,7.164,15.039,0.0632,4.3021,3.4232,0.8173,1.7311,3.1202,0.0139,1.3728,6.6859,0.1342,0.9741,3.9238,1.5563,5.9775,0.2541,5.2817,0.0238,3.5174,0.9055,5.6754,6.1182,5.5294,0.3836,5.4505,6.1395,4.7526,0.6954,4.3071,0.7273,0.3377,2.1317,2.4488,3.3348,0.181,3.3637,0.9043,4.9446,3.1093,4.0967,3.224,3.22,0.4396,1.5878,5.67,3.9252,0.1525,4.0373,0.2697,6.0776,2.9982,4.4967,5.2859,1.9832,4.9367,2.0244,3.7704,5.4864,2.2223,3.7338,1.1196,4.6237,3.548,0.0352,5.518,2.0374,2.4504,4.2059,3.5747,0.4922,4.8056,6.5903,0.4859,0.2521,2.5299,2.3544,2.0567,2.3801,7.2168,4.11,0.0005,2.3783,0.4857,2.0888,2.9982,1.9455,5.6376,3.053,3.3427,4.0945,3.3356,1.1056,0.7281,0.6521,5.2651,2.4063,5.5725,5.4756,1.7848,1.7066,4.709,7.6717,1.7084,1.3063,2.8301,4.5608,1.165,0.0102,4.949,2.5138,0.4116,3.8255,0.0687,2.1523,3.5035,3.2756,0.0295,0.3028,3.9083,0.4245,1.6532,4.2671,0.0001,3.2009,5.0858,3.0797,0.6076,3.4498,0.2918,0.4913,3.8774,3.252,1.1408,6.4154,2.0728,5.0342,3.362,1.705,7.7104,4.8453,2.5188,1.9494,2.8959,0.9512,6.2077,2.0357,1.406,0.9351,5.9391,4.0309,2.8616,2.2466,1.378,6.6379,3.1039,6.1088,0.0845,5.9882,6.7379,0.7531,2.3061,5.4598,0.4296,1.5728,0.6968,3.9998,5.5018,0.0001,3.4988,5.4278,0.4155,4.1945,3.7046,3.0427,0.6399,6.6755,0.0023,0.0129,2.8389,4.9376,1.2393,2.4918,4.6206,0.4164,6.2072,5.4296,0.0012,0.143,1.0765,3.6094,0.5126,1.4013,2.6624,1.8983,3.288,5.7519,4.5068,0.223,3.8019,2.5874,3.374,0.0522,0.5436,1.3607,2.1273,4.2319,3.2913,7.8889,0.059,4.8395,6.7348,0.1426,0.34,2.3725,4.9891,1.3117,0.1974,0.3144,3.7862,0.7818,1.6934,1.5281,5.2402,0.5006,5.72,5.7569,1.1891,2.0727,2.4853,3.2968,0.2781,4.1262,4.0121,2.407,5.1585,0.6034,3.28,0.1623,1.0235,4.716,0.0036,0.0585,5.9579,0.5217,5.9964,2.2685,0.0095,0.2409,2.7614,2.2721,2.1831,3.395,0.0237,3.4268,0.5381,0.7498,4.2632,1.0371,3.9784,2.3081,3.552,2.4612,0.3616,5.3553,0.1788,0.0,1.2304,1.6561,1.2379,0.0161,0.8894,4.4601,0.0912,0.4517,4.4673,4.9502,3.7891,2.493,1.2365,5.5525,5.2025,2.2465,5.716,0.1425,0.5209,1.8811,0.1445,3.8828,0.6379,2.2498,0.1629,4.6675,5.6557,2.4409,1.5089,3.9521,6.0071,2.1635,4.8549,9.0808,0.049,0.0025,0.7445,1.7212,1.7419,2.3905,1.1904,1.7206,0.4963,1.0235,5.2621,1.5166,1.8332,6.3279,3.3667,0.1081,3.0181,1.0244,3.6679,2.3396,1.1816,4.5387,4.9662,2.7454,2.7726,4.6764,2.17,3.5607,5.6029,1.2089,8.5699,0.0033,2.9436,5.0512,2.3848,2.7005,6.7099,2.0417,0.0001,5.5025,3.5407,0.4586,7.3419,4.1534,3.4651,4.3254,5.762,0.372,1.0184,5.9679,0.2163,2.4355,0.0003,2.3917,1.452,0.7755,1.8773,0.1434,0.6122,3.0852,1.0156,2.1307,4.6286,10.5118,6.0549,4.8926,0.9405,0.3402,4.247,0.4399,3.819,1.2193,4.4805,2.4313,2.2625,1.7235,2.8435,0.1438,0.4861,6.6509,4.6411,1.8938,2.9709,1.5529,0.9978,3.6483,2.6364,3.5956,4.1886,0.369,6.4951,8.2253,1.0826,2.1969,0.0001,5.8754,0.2504,2.3453,0.7701,3.3219,4.7605,4.0408,0.2877,4.5362,4.2696,1.2919,0.0243,0.218,3.1461,7.2147,7.6638,2.1545,2.3862,3.7395,0.0393,5.191,3.3688,0.99,5.2114,0.4726,2.7251,0.0135,3.1894,1.9948,0.9809,1.0211,7.3663,4.3968,5.8395,0.3893,0.2897]}

Thomas","text":"At the state convention in June 1816 Jennings may have informed some of the delegates that he intended to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy. Thomas G. Washington proposed for him, but the nomination came from Alexander W. McLane, a Confederate sympathizer who was running as a Democrat.\nJennings hoped that Washington would support him, but he did not and in the end, McLane was unanimously nominated. After his inauguration as governor and the loss of the election to the United States Congress in December 1816, Jennings returned to politics as a member of the Tennessee General Assembly. There he was a powerful force in the legislature, helping to pass legislation such as the Civil Service Act of 1817.\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn the early 1820s, Jennings began to raise a number of controversies. He became one of the main allies of Francis M. Kelley in dealing with him as a candidate for president of the Tennessee legislature. He was also involved in a number of partisan disputes that culminated in a conflict with the U.S. Army. The following years saw him regularly attacked in the media by William M. Trott and other Democratic opponents who regarded him as being too supportive of the United States. After an unsuccessful run for U.S. Congress in 1824, Jennings turned fully to politics in the state legislature where he would become a leading figure.\n\nFirst term\n\nIn the Spring of 1830 the Tennessee General Assembly elected Trott for a second term as governor. Jennings did not seek another term and began to work to defeat Kelley for president of the legislature. He spent most of his time campaigning and in January 1832 became the first Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress. A close election between him and Robert E. Lee, Jr. resulted in an electoral college victory by Lee. The next year Jennings was defeated by James J. Walker.\n\nSecond term\n\nJennings was the first Democrat in the state to win an election for president of the legislature. He was reelected in 1837, defeating Lee's son and the Republican candidate, John C. Calhoun. After winning the presidency of the legislature he was unanimously chosen by the other members to succeed Calhoun as governor.

After the end of the war she was only renamed in 1955 as a member of the Soviet fleet of the Baltic Sea Fleet. In 1971 she was transferred to the Soviet Union\u2019s Baltic Fleet and renamed as Sovetskaya (Russian : \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f). In the autumn of 1991 she was transferred to the Finnish Navy. In the spring of 1992 the ship was damaged in a shipwreck off the Finnish island of Kotka. Despite the serious structural damage, the ship remained afloat for several days for rescue and rehabilitation before it was finally sunk.  The wreck was located on 7 September 1992, in shallow water (9 metres deep) off the Finnish island of Kotka.\nSovetskaya was laid down on 22 July 1940 (Dutch: 22-Juillet 1940) by  the Sovnarkom in Molotovsk. On 1 June 1939, she was named Avia. Due to her performance as a training ship she was transferred to the Baltic Fleet on 20 February 1941, and her name was changed to Sovetskaya. Two weeks after her transfer to the Baltic Fleet she reached the port of Helsinborg to be decommissioned. Later she was renamed to Sovetskaya (Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), and placed in the Baltic Fleet. In 1971 she was transferred to the Soviet Union\u2019s Baltic Fleet, and restored her original name of Sovetskaya (SOV) while on board the Russian ship Avia. She was renamed in 1980 when she joined the Soviet Naval Fleet of the Baltic Sea Fleet.

{"prompt":"The Tales series originated when Phantasia began production , based on an unpublished novel titled Tale Phantasia ( < unk > , < unk > < unk > ) , written by the game 's","text":"The Tales series originated when Phantasia began production, based on an unpublished novel titled Tale Phantasia ( < unk >, < unk > < unk > ), written by the game's director Minoru Yoshishige. However, while Tale Phantasia is available to the public, it does not include an actual gameplay sequence. The concept, storyline, characters and main gameplay all derive from this short, and although the production process involved two years of development, the game was eventually released with little fanfare. This unfulfilled potential is illustrated by the fact that a new version of Tale Phantasia is being published separately and sold to interested consumers as an alternative to the game that was initially supposed to be released.\nThe two other original Tales games ( Tales of Phantasia and Tales of Symphonia ) were also produced independently, as were a few early games like Tales of Mystery and Tales of Mystery : The New Order. From 1999 onwards, these games were collected together as Tales of Phantasia and Tales of Symphonia in a single boxed set called Tales of Phantasia Millennium, to prevent confusion. However, later Tales of Phantasia and Symphonia games ( especially Symphony of the Flowers ) are not included in Tales of Phantasia Millennium.\nThe first game in the series, Tales of Phantasia, was developed in 1989 and published in Japan for a MSX-2 console in 1990. In 1994, this game was published as an arcade game on the Japanese PC-9801. In 1995, an English-language port was released for the Sega Saturn, and in 1998, on the Sony PlayStation.\nIn 2000, Tales of Phantasia was remade in the PlayStation version, with various changes to the controls and graphics, and in 2001, on the GameCube, alongside new versions of the other two games in the Tales series ( Tales of Symphony and Tales of Mystery : The New Order ), for an enhanced experience. Despite these improvements, critic William Farquhar wrote that the port to the GameCube was \" barely recognisable as the original gameplay is basically identical \". In 2004, Tales of Phantasia received an E-Manga adaptation in the form of a Japanese comic, titled Tales of Phantasia. The author is unnamed, and although the character designs have changed a lot over time, the style is remarkably identical to the original game. The E-Manga was first published on August 15, 2000 and published in two volumes, which were later compiled in a larger volume titled Tales of Phantasia - The Original Complete Comic - Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.","token_len":521,"entropy":[11.8431,7.5399,8.441,5.0318,12.4232,3.4663,4.3879,5.4891,2.4271,5.5438,0.1564,3.217,3.6817,1.5048,6.3663,7.5081,9.6748,0.0856,3.1727,11.9694,9.3828,5.5284,5.1991,4.2732,3.023,2.1938,0.0983,0.2539,6.4497,1.1057,0.0442,0.1642,2.4911,2.3493,0.2643,3.2492,6.4878,0.5587,2.8837,9.5735,0.0273,4.503,7.0375,4.6345,0.8575,5.2812,0.0557,4.5135,6.6164,0.0152,0.0006,2.23,5.6152,2.7742,3.121,0.8372,0.9656,0.8465,3.2918,0.0388,2.4867,3.218,3.0417,4.4448,4.9829,0.7085,2.4101,5.7384,4.3571,7.4834,0.3247,4.3753,1.3726,5.1506,3.8136,6.1852,5.4269,0.0656,3.547,4.7379,3.7192,3.1124,4.8128,1.5191,6.7016,4.2554,3.5338,5.6414,2.0787,0.5467,1.9073,0.4158,1.3672,2.1894,1.9046,2.9441,1.4021,4.0834,4.5728,1.0287,0.0237,0.6758,4.4572,7.1196,8.7094,0.0901,3.4812,2.6083,4.3593,1.1892,0.5664,1.5864,0.0256,4.1776,4.5353,2.8396,0.161,3.41,0.0192,0.0003,1.8344,1.9686,4.0939,8.1729,3.6242,6.4035,2.7312,6.9699,4.2086,3.7022,2.4012,5.2305,0.3999,0.4276,3.7957,3.0622,1.4359,3.359,5.7093,0.0035,0.6329,0.7565,1.9255,1.0572,8.6727,5.5874,4.5451,4.8319,1.357,0.9006,3.6515,2.0429,0.4407,1.7376,0.0154,0.653,0.5048,0.0757,3.2181,0.0022,0.0211,0.8705,1.1419,2.4099,3.2834,3.8088,1.4766,3.3361,2.6605,3.944,2.289,5.5531,2.7434,3.0798,1.573,0.1546,6.0958,2.0594,0.8132,0.0629,4.3834,7.7536,2.3151,6.0359,5.7071,1.3134,6.6886,5.256,2.874,0.1434,4.3342,0.8417,0.6852,6.8596,2.1439,2.5269,1.1059,0.4939,1.3201,0.0032,1.8292,0.4445,0.0203,0.0337,0.0012,0.0005,4.0646,1.9301,1.3906,4.9768,0.6148,2.799,0.7752,0.1742,1.2998,0.0153,9.6854,4.009,5.4964,6.0827,4.4678,1.5128,3.0489,0.0274,5.5196,1.9672,0.8028,1.1645,0.0027,1.9822,5.0825,0.0006,0.001,1.3855,3.2515,6.6358,9.0094,0.2205,0.195,6.5963,0.8298,3.5534,2.2273,1.7749,0.3995,3.3808,0.1012,0.1691,0.0024,0.3021,1.236,0.773,1.8776,2.8616,3.0236,1.5783,0.2501,1.3631,1.0276,0.471,0.0476,0.6128,0.0029,2.226,0.4545,3.6629,2.7562,4.465,2.4204,2.2638,0.6672,3.0328,3.1323,2.8455,9.7038,1.1358,1.4071,4.6277,3.1467,1.565,3.0162,0.3485,3.0081,2.9674,0.2716,4.6673,0.5832,0.2475,3.6382,2.0838,3.5561,4.0215,0.9931,2.6471,0.6247,4.5041,3.4575,3.7342,1.5114,5.1601,1.6898,2.2306,1.0761,0.1412,5.359,2.2771,1.7842,0.7253,4.5047,1.0164,0.4481,1.5156,0.4389,3.1114,1.4464,1.6664,1.8121,1.3152,2.2467,0.4702,6.5034,0.2621,4.646,0.6401,2.9825,1.6468,2.4584,3.0757,0.0557,0.9033,0.0541,0.3847,0.0031,1.3923,3.8095,1.1543,1.7786,1.99,3.6308,3.321,1.8575,2.0623,5.2587,2.0179,1.6506,0.5367,4.5901,1.2387,3.5905,1.7127,1.6684,2.2526,1.4027,0.4196,2.729,0.089,4.2562,0.9828,1.1331,8.4216,4.635,3.7654,0.1703,1.3008,5.2137,1.9332,0.5728,3.3192,0.1277,3.3692,0.1336,2.8226,0.3863,0.045,6.7033,3.3289,0.297,0.0217,5.1572,4.3732,0.1486,0.1179,0.0033,3.2136,3.4071,2.9612,5.0495,2.8319,0.7896,6.0108,2.1225,2.774,0.0933,13.4571,6.4857,7.4659,3.135,0.2582,2.8585,1.1502,1.1088,6.1048,3.974,0.2461,1.9033,0.0722,1.0638,0.9108,12.3981,7.422,0.1179,2.2088,1.7096,0.8631,7.5098,5.1422,7.3466,2.2133,5.0904,2.6642,2.4742,0.0482,1.7471,0.0768,0.2932,0.0014,5.3001,1.6611,3.5317,4.614,4.0246,0.8834,1.0982,2.8608,1.0133,1.8982,0.0022,1.6985,3.3006,3.7429,2.9018,3.7231,0.5866,0.0784,0.2428,0.0132,4.0113,2.0633,6.7431,4.1036,7.7796,1.3461,1.3759,4.1129,1.3071,3.96,1.6203,2.6262,1.8033,3.6522,1.3627,1.9497,2.6078,0.1592,1.1127,5.8427,1.9204,6.5375,5.0225,0.7678,0.7746,0.7644,1.4545,0.7323,2.2223,6.2635,0.0989,0.1157,0.002,2.8756,3.5593,0.7669,2.604,2.9393,3.3029,0.1288,3.427,3.3618,3.6198,1.1718,4.9593,1.2446,1.3942,5.0331,1.1605,2.2763,6.0291,3.5928,2.737,6.2246,1.4185,2.8002,0.2095,0.0721,0.1558,0.0029,4.9849,1.9467,4.2467,5.5162,5.2342,4.4277,4.2594,0.4015,0.8377,2.4264,2.6074,0.0034,0.0556,0.6685]}

Its climate is moderate throughout the year.\nFrom my own perspective, this is why it is extremely important to stay connected with other parents and the staff here. Our son started this school in and it has been a wonderful experience to help guide him through puberty. Our family has been extremely pleased with the school and teachers and we are glad he is now a graduate.\nI love Portlaogans school but they are not accepting new students. The teachers are extremely kind & supportive and our son loves the staff.\nOur son started Pre-K on campus and then attended kindergarten, kindergarten and first grade here at the end of first grade he was offered a 2 year scholarship to attend elementary school in the USA.\nWe have taken the decision to move our son into second grade here at the end of this year due to our previous experience with Pre-K. He is an avid reader and his grades have always been high, not just academically but in his other classes. He is always upbeat and active here at school and loves all of his teachers.\nThe students here are very diverse and are ready to learn for the next level. The school has an open attitude and is prepared to accept all students.\nThis is an amazing school for all kids. The girls school is very strong at both English & French and it is always good for my daughter to have a friend she can talk and play with.\nThis is one of the most challenging schools in the area to navigate. They have not changed anything since they opened in January although they have added another building.","token_len":522,"entropy":[10.7677,7.9675,10.014,0.723,9.319,7.8044,9.102,6.0153,0.0191,14.2685,4.034,11.4682,7.2917,0.149,2.8313,5.273,3.6696,9.3879,3.7138,1.5149,6.5065,1.8869,2.3647,6.8582,0.0968,4.9486,9.2991,3.5267,4.0923,4.3128,0.1051,3.0089,10.3604,3.8479,3.7223,15.1747,0.2176,7.5601,9.0295,7.9139,5.7363,2.489,2.1687,7.1492,3.7225,0.8399,9.1967,5.6384,7.2405,4.2964,3.9106,0.7172,3.5982,0.7332,0.8655,2.363,2.083,0.7761,2.5585,6.8225,4.8495,0.949,2.0043,5.0091,1.5892,2.0496,6.5689,0.4572,2.138,5.0155,0.8201,0.9003,6.2793,0.3127,0.5852,0.9779,1.1199,0.1148,0.9659,1.7476,1.7113,1.1308,3.3329,1.58,0.6069,6.3168,5.8521,0.5383,0.5676,3.7497,0.2021,10.2803,10.799,0.6626,2.2089,6.1288,0.3256,0.009,5.4945,1.0671,4.1924,0.6531,3.9379,1.3632,1.9525,2.3588,5.1406,2.8146,3.9638,6.5811,0.1152,3.7277,2.0502,2.4838,8.1362,0.9088,9.1378,3.6401,1.0999,3.0773,3.277,1.4995,4.2578,0.0317,0.8798,9.2367,3.1615,9.0397,4.2505,4.4131,0.4591,4.0834,5.8053,4.1987,5.1813,1.2217,8.808,4.456,1.2494,7.9944,3.7333,4.7708,1.0077,3.1448,0.2621,1.2164,5.4168,2.1752,3.1618,0.8686,0.9354,7.3666,1.8677,1.4733,1.8183,1.4145,0.2383,0.1222,4.0431,4.7597,0.1329,14.6756,3.7334,2.2121,1.1234,1.9819,1.2391,6.2922,0.0149,0.8212,8.1994,6.0594,1.6468,5.2418,0.506,1.191,1.5543,3.9809,2.1191,2.3889,6.3059,0.1671,2.33,10.483,3.5592,1.6242,6.5039,0.0162,0.2631,2.942,3.6714,0.0156,2.6151,2.2275,4.3134,0.5983,1.7822,3.6611,0.224,0.8581,1.051,3.6932,0.2368,0.0086,6.6751,2.1306,5.1684,5.536,0.5326,5.3434,5.7741,0.3571,0.399,2.2121,3.95,5.5929,8.0948,2.764,3.9193,0.2023,3.6546,1.1445,5.9419,2.5721,0.5122,5.2548,1.0802,0.5525,5.0368,4.3492,1.0363,3.3973,9.5318,1.4956,4.4602,6.084,4.2558,0.8802,4.5684,5.3857,5.6676,4.2822,4.5691,1.8303,7.5904,5.981,1.6885,1.1873,1.1118,2.7892,0.8074,2.8455,4.5385,5.7429,0.5837,0.986,7.2773,1.0352,3.6547,3.0352,1.6633,1.3455,4.2342,6.1964,0.3632,1.0788,2.1824,1.2028,7.3665,2.4639,2.276,1.0437,4.1149,5.1131,1.2039,2.7429,2.9488,6.0031,1.0183,2.0966,2.7573,4.6274,7.254,7.3564,10.7428,5.7155,5.6285,4.5543,4.191,0.891,1.4748,7.3792,2.9011,0.6192,0.7918,2.8226,4.1281,1.123,3.5816,4.7332,6.427,2.9909,1.5951,4.1016,1.5244,3.5862,2.4183,4.483,1.4569,2.6082,3.462,1.8631,3.272,9.5189,1.1089,2.3982,4.6152,6.5377,1.6885,4.771,5.0014,5.9446,3.1007,6.3808,1.0955,3.5006,0.3195,5.4375,2.6339,1.8489,4.1772,0.0474,6.759,0.7931,7.4583,1.5865,5.5588,1.1979,6.574,1.205,2.6348,0.9462,2.9345,6.4631,0.1174,1.9432,1.9722,6.1829,0.473,2.7992,1.9756,1.7629,5.331,2.397,3.7584,0.309,2.3154,2.3695,1.3326,3.7468,6.0557,0.2843,2.1078,1.5819,1.0725,1.0412,0.0153,4.3346,0.7969,4.5608,0.0155,2.8468,5.9883,2.0752,1.2992,4.8429,0.0882,0.0337,1.0709,2.5623,1.3881,4.1064,2.9115,2.1379,1.0128,4.2525,4.7092,1.2525,4.7775,0.2791,3.2247,2.7289,5.17,2.5673,5.029,0.0021,1.1932,3.0378,2.0601,5.6087,3.4297,0.6314,2.0371,1.3372,3.9513,7.0206,0.6731,6.4491,5.454,1.3413,2.8377,1.1581,3.486,4.9101,2.2662,2.2126,2.4176,0.7569,0.9255,2.6449,4.4462,1.509,0.7586,1.6107,4.5847,0.8639,2.8086,5.2041,0.2233,1.6413,5.4741,1.7386,2.0084,2.6797,0.6989,2.5667,2.6905,1.554,3.02,3.5912,6.5212,0.9225,2.3007,5.7818,0.3894,3.3405,2.3411,1.1822,1.4884,1.3444,4.2236,0.7253,3.0329,1.9367,1.0975,2.49,2.4945,4.2056,1.3091,2.3067,6.0625,5.9193,0.7064,1.9093,4.7242,5.3116,4.8242,5.6758,3.8332,2.083,1.8522,3.5675,0.6952,3.8108,4.8775,2.6283,5.4554,3.1816,1.0991,2.8191,1.0004,5.8584,5.4812,1.532,2.259,5.8213,3.5009,0.1467,0.467,1.1013,3.6505,0.5589,2.9652,0.2152,0.41,1.7304,4.6409,1.0355,0.7715,0.641,3.664,3.3534,4.4587,1.1891,4.6956,1.106,5.3612,4.7061,5.6133,2.1546,2.7473,2.473,1.6853,5.6052,10.2478,1.3291,0.7599,3.9864,5.0486,3.775,1.9299]}

Few details survive of","text":"The cathedral has had perhaps a dozen organs over the course of its history. The earliest is mentioned in a report written to the king of Spain in 1530. Few details survive of its performance, though it is believed that the organ might have played for musical services in 1530 and was rebuilt in 1549. The latest organ built in England is said to date from 1668 and to have been made locally in York to specifications by Thomas Heaney and his sons. In 1850, a new organ of 24 ranks was built by R.Dowling & Co, also for local use. The organ is a good example of English early 20th century design. The instrument is quite large and had its original traction wheels of iron, two in the case of the first three ranks, one for the lower 3 ranks and one for the remaining 13 ranks.\nIn the past the cathedral has been home to several organs. In the 18th century an organ from London, the first to be used at York, was installed in the church. It is thought that by 1765, this organ had become an antiquity, though there is a photograph in the archive showing a pipe of the organ with its headpiece being removed. Two French organs were also used over the 19th century, the first being one supplied by the Paris based Bach organ dealership of Michel Delahaye. This organ was rebuilt with a new hammer and pulley mechanism in 1878. This organ is still sounding well today, though it is currently being rebuilt with a new system.\nTwo small organs have been supplied by the organ builder Joseph Rutter, one based on the model he produced for the Balthasar Neumann organ in the English National Cathedral, London. This organ appears to have worked well in the early years of its operation, but in the years leading up to the earthquake of 1967, it became impossible for the rector to provide congregational singing, resulting in this organ being taken down. A new Rutter organ was finally installed in 1969. This was a smaller version of the original, designed using a new, cheaper and lighter hammer and pulley system. It became so popular that it doubled the seating capacity of the cathedral, and also gave the choir a much higher quality of pipe. In 1998, a single additional bell for bells 2,3,4, 6 and 7 was installed using a modified and slightly upgraded installation.\nDuring the 20th century and even into the 21st century, the cathedral organ has also been used for occasional events including weddings; concerts by the York Canterbury; and for services of memorial and farewell.","token_len":523,"entropy":[11.524,2.8904,4.5717,9.1637,3.9248,1.6123,11.3039,6.3327,0.1164,3.9879,0.0007,0.9936,0.9718,1.1964,2.0067,4.674,3.588,6.748,0.5921,2.2636,5.2115,2.8374,3.5555,0.7989,3.4112,1.1908,3.5449,1.4898,2.0441,4.4699,1.2725,9.2236,3.7485,5.5969,1.6729,1.6034,6.8986,1.2586,2.8726,1.8419,1.5011,2.2422,0.7386,1.4472,2.6536,5.9557,0.1706,4.6164,7.3878,9.06,8.3646,2.6685,4.4262,3.0839,3.777,3.375,7.1977,1.1833,0.5084,3.8374,0.3197,1.8361,6.4963,1.0983,6.3933,1.7902,4.2571,1.2933,2.8861,0.0066,3.1787,0.9489,2.3497,5.5332,2.265,4.8992,0.4272,0.4417,3.2453,7.9886,1.724,6.8672,5.9383,11.7549,5.7114,4.45,6.7901,3.019,3.246,2.7243,4.3343,0.6856,3.367,6.8452,1.01,2.1156,3.1173,0.467,3.722,7.8583,10.569,0.7585,1.0883,3.1286,5.761,0.9086,4.1318,9.7476,2.0366,5.177,0.6664,2.6038,6.2853,6.201,4.7265,1.5954,0.7927,1.5904,2.6577,2.0462,3.9282,5.4677,0.8984,0.0237,6.0596,7.5596,7.1661,0.0018,0.2692,3.7647,0.9971,1.9348,6.3262,1.4445,5.277,2.1548,0.9765,5.9875,3.6275,3.2989,13.0617,5.43,4.9918,4.9843,2.1249,6.1255,4.0168,2.1607,5.0119,0.0916,0.5675,4.1515,3.9111,2.399,1.4119,3.5599,2.5391,1.7912,4.4301,6.5648,3.8579,0.7054,0.6476,0.0963,0.1324,6.2319,5.9718,0.7027,0.3103,3.1144,7.2845,1.7681,5.1428,2.8195,3.8921,0.8213,1.1973,4.9994,0.0174,2.8741,5.9395,1.8365,1.8567,1.605,2.9558,0.3229,0.0848,3.8885,0.389,3.4821,4.0253,2.794,3.0812,4.2676,2.8763,0.458,3.9167,3.2534,4.6789,0.5926,0.2429,3.8146,1.1848,1.0293,3.1934,1.4703,2.3558,1.7393,1.9869,0.2534,5.5281,2.6414,4.7616,1.8715,3.1424,0.3068,1.4116,3.5179,2.9649,11.7275,1.81,2.5836,3.0401,0.7412,3.5048,8.1919,3.2234,0.6611,6.1638,3.1172,1.7455,8.1842,4.0619,2.0425,0.3297,4.1248,1.9174,3.8887,5.8702,5.1606,2.8244,0.8006,5.7286,6.7284,2.901,1.2348,2.5212,2.8234,5.9033,0.2746,6.3803,0.0562,0.0469,1.0024,2.5351,1.041,1.1254,4.8302,6.6141,0.5967,1.4769,5.3515,7.9848,7.7144,3.0084,7.6378,3.8422,9.3235,7.5537,5.2108,1.0691,1.4405,3.8836,0.7277,0.7687,4.9631,4.4496,1.6786,2.4092,7.4236,1.161,7.492,0.1404,3.9389,1.8551,1.11,4.4266,0.9036,3.7565,1.2481,1.916,3.0357,10.6375,4.2775,2.3502,1.1806,1.2251,1.2669,1.118,5.6288,2.1106,3.1807,2.3774,1.0467,1.3121,5.7982,1.8037,1.0514,5.8968,4.9601,3.5165,2.8566,0.4313,6.8931,1.2707,0.8958,4.839,5.0502,6.3717,4.2922,5.5265,2.0473,3.0421,6.8221,1.4512,1.4153,6.4564,6.4983,4.4021,1.2938,0.921,5.7159,5.9771,1.0847,9.2465,3.0165,1.847,2.4326,2.5734,7.3024,5.9976,2.2871,2.1704,4.9609,0.9026,2.7173,0.6931,5.7688,0.2894,0.4406,5.9983,1.5683,1.9798,1.1411,2.3858,3.2809,0.4597,2.8116,4.0822,0.8293,1.8852,3.0645,0.9732,4.163,3.9386,0.0379,0.006,0.7527,8.0557,2.2161,7.0544,0.8896,1.4173,2.1061,4.5883,1.7623,0.9688,7.4748,4.0341,0.6437,4.3096,12.9999,1.6714,6.2905,3.0166,7.139,0.0104,4.6607,0.2935,0.4674,4.939,2.4435,0.8709,3.4681,2.3708,7.5502,0.0456,0.2467,0.8294,6.2126,2.3973,0.4893,3.8967,1.3093,2.6644,2.3586,2.2596,5.7457,2.5336,0.3393,0.3908,1.4422,1.8914,4.8921,5.1458,1.3205,2.9228,3.7965,6.0668,2.411,2.9436,2.8617,0.5317,0.1509,0.0058,1.7849,0.4987,2.1127,5.3494,4.2766,1.4102,0.4574,1.5279,9.9924,2.7372,7.8861,0.5039,0.3952,0.3127,1.6152,1.7733,1.8533,4.2499,3.9399,1.1187,2.6172,1.3302,2.9832,2.3702,2.97,0.9313,13.0608,1.3893,2.8487,5.9604,0.4641,1.5887,5.2756,7.0702,6.0045,4.4866,6.6081,7.6013,2.2064,2.4651,0.9788,0.317,1.1891,6.6715,0.8388,0.6396,0.4949,1.2242,6.3986,1.0636,3.6347,4.0902,3.6126,4.0939,7.9401,1.5815,1.7093,5.1613,0.3185,3.2833,0.031,0.1048,4.324,4.415,2.3942,0.0872,2.0641,0.0007,0.2742,0.401,1.0993,1.4229,5.5406,1.9649,3.6595,0.7137,1.1243,1.4046,7.3922,4.5577,4.1619,3.0045,6.0568,3.1427,4.3525,1.4745,7.7775,9.7461,8.4708,1.6322,2.9043,5.5874,3.0165,8.6316,3.0251,7.9559,3.3132]}

{"prompt":"By August 16 , a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana . With estimated winds of 105 mph ( 165 km \/ h ) , it tracked westward","text":"By August 16, a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana. With estimated winds of 105 mph ( 165 km \/ h ), it tracked westward toward Texas, and then further west to western Oklahoma. As expected from the intense weather that had been occurring, a series of tornadoes struck parts of Iowa and eastern Ohio as well. These tornadoes produced a total of 14 deaths and caused significant injury to numerous people. At the same time, intense pressure systems in the central United States produced heavy rainfall along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, much of Kansas, and central Oklahoma. At the time of high pressure development, rainfall measured by rain gauges in Oklahoma exceeded 8 inches (200 mm). Heavier rainfall was also documented on the Mexican border, with a strong system that peaked at 4 inches (100 mm) near Fort Tejon on August 15. In southern Illinois, rainfall exceeded 3 inches (75 mm) as rain storms produced the record-breaking rainfall totals at Fort Morgan at 5 inches (125 mm) and Jackson at 4 inches (100 mm).\nIn August 2005, one of the strongest storms to hit New England in decades brought massive rainfall from western Mass. to northwestern and central Connecticut. From late July to August 31, 2005, New England received an estimated 1,350-1,700 mm (48-55 in.) of rainfall from the El Nino. Heavy rainfall was most intense in the eastern portion of Massachusetts, with rainfall amounts to the southeast that exceeded 2,000-2,500 mm (73 in.) in parts of central Massachusetts. The highest single 24-hour rainfall was 18.3 inches (49 cm) at the National Weather Service observation at Quabbin Lake. Heavy rainfall reached the Northeast on Thursday, August 26. It began on the New Hampshire seacoast, where heavy winds and rain from the El Nino produced a tornado system in eastern Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Over the next two days, the main rain area moved from the south to the northeast, and rainfall totals increased. Heavy rainfall and flooding occurred in central Massachusetts, eastern Maine, northwestern and eastern Rhode Island, northern Vermont, and upstate Connecticut. Some areas received 5 to 7 inches (12.5 to 18.4 cm) of rain from the El Nino in a 24-hour period, and heavy rainstorms from the El Nino produced flash flooding in rivers, ditches, and lakes. Between late July and early August, rainfall and flooding totals from the El Nino in New England averaged 1,140 mm (50 in.) above normal.","token_len":523,"entropy":[8.5946,4.46,0.2233,3.8845,8.485,6.5282,3.2497,7.7878,0.9845,1.1327,5.7589,2.381,0.126,0.042,7.2645,0.0256,6.6125,0.8609,5.6749,8.7838,0.6332,0.3812,5.2909,0.4985,2.3054,13.5094,0.2803,4.6904,1.2811,1.8409,2.5699,8.4189,3.6399,1.5246,2.6538,3.0041,1.6488,2.4091,2.2832,6.8811,1.9244,1.9448,5.3932,3.2904,0.8845,3.8811,5.0546,4.8822,1.032,6.2577,3.5307,4.4455,3.9674,2.141,4.1768,2.1422,3.2319,5.4389,0.0019,4.1002,0.0372,3.4503,5.1941,0.0043,7.0244,1.0624,5.9617,4.1608,3.8164,0.4078,1.9781,4.128,1.601,0.0074,4.4393,2.2808,3.0845,0.0999,4.1033,2.1534,1.0508,5.5313,4.4334,6.1801,0.6178,5.2059,0.9249,0.7081,4.7973,1.2813,1.4237,0.0055,0.1619,6.6668,6.1556,6.0798,2.8901,0.5046,2.7127,1.7903,0.0023,4.3131,4.095,1.5978,4.1192,0.6784,2.392,2.8179,2.6677,2.0179,1.3867,6.63,0.1019,6.2547,1.3553,1.0034,5.4671,2.8471,0.5073,4.4461,1.0215,2.2913,0.3783,8.191,1.7422,5.2781,0.5825,4.7499,7.2746,3.1469,8.1739,1.4717,0.0122,1.7807,2.9654,5.4495,5.2392,0.5091,0.606,5.741,1.1496,1.4696,8.4432,1.1793,0.904,2.341,1.0114,6.4334,2.983,0.843,6.6885,1.3351,1.3678,2.709,2.507,4.617,5.5411,3.6375,6.0251,0.5931,3.2856,0.6731,0.0962,2.9412,0.0463,0.6463,5.3264,4.3698,7.4617,2.4883,2.4602,2.2807,3.0774,0.9584,2.8425,4.778,5.0463,0.1994,4.0504,3.9006,3.7166,0.2087,0.0143,4.7492,0.0232,0.5372,3.8309,4.6791,8.9518,5.3474,4.5564,7.1046,2.0347,0.6685,2.8864,3.0419,4.2834,3.678,5.8995,5.9794,3.5253,1.7221,0.0213,4.8027,0.0224,0.89,0.6439,6.124,0.5938,2.051,0.2449,0.0003,1.8988,0.0072,0.2375,2.0935,7.8928,4.0227,4.441,0.1825,5.65,0.8209,0.1402,1.6071,1.3416,1.4618,0.9979,4.0017,2.4726,1.6593,2.7562,5.1424,5.111,2.458,4.3517,5.0029,9.4956,1.6632,1.93,4.8615,5.5634,0.7894,3.6249,0.5959,5.5184,4.7526,2.3785,1.4133,3.7772,7.6132,0.0742,2.6804,0.0792,4.8431,0.115,3.6802,3.2938,3.2027,2.4027,1.3671,5.4203,3.7435,1.0879,0.001,2.7814,4.1898,0.7894,6.4729,0.3953,3.4189,2.53,3.5109,0.2001,0.9995,2.4624,1.7015,5.3941,1.5438,0.0043,4.2896,5.9473,0.9931,1.8757,6.1932,2.0132,0.6216,1.2478,3.1433,3.6586,0.0069,3.4015,0.8078,1.7051,3.2638,5.6043,3.6025,6.0881,7.7729,6.9517,2.0585,2.2392,1.0909,1.2642,2.3185,1.066,0.0003,0.9188,0.0544,0.2414,6.2545,2.9496,0.4061,1.7968,4.8076,0.0155,3.7259,2.3144,0.6863,1.996,3.7222,6.537,9.7782,0.1124,0.4109,0.7046,2.8139,7.8719,2.6356,2.2751,0.9762,0.0243,5.4233,2.1978,0.469,2.2804,1.7733,6.2071,0.8005,0.0051,8.5066,7.1966,7.6501,8.3034,1.5716,3.1119,2.4187,4.5702,0.5805,4.3729,2.1373,3.9225,3.0421,6.306,0.5907,1.1316,3.2947,1.7406,4.2473,4.5841,3.1158,1.0217,3.8862,2.5196,7.0448,4.5877,0.001,1.4579,3.5682,2.7455,5.3861,2.4862,3.7106,4.7299,1.0497,4.0858,0.1491,0.0019,4.9089,1.8023,6.0354,6.3208,3.7433,4.5103,3.4221,1.905,6.1244,2.015,3.5422,0.0009,0.4767,4.7735,0.8325,0.8022,2.0824,0.3902,0.1569,1.9709,6.5873,4.6631,6.2147,5.4048,2.616,1.6755,3.8951,0.6233,0.3059,2.5216,0.9567,1.825,4.607,1.5794,2.3355,2.3394,4.2968,0.8114,4.3903,3.7675,3.5054,0.9898,3.8123,3.1264,1.0934,4.7221,2.8264,0.4026,4.8946,3.2456,3.7614,3.5446,0.0039,0.8201,5.3871,4.1877,0.4949,1.4414,6.7347,0.2794,5.424,0.2671,4.8503,2.5998,3.4577,5.4544,1.4756,1.9074,0.0751,0.2539,4.569,3.0083,0.7742,0.6387,2.8703,1.4278,2.8124,0.6611,0.0985,0.1764,0.8013,2.5886,0.73,1.0009,0.0125,0.0026,3.0795,4.3315,3.5243,0.0871,0.0282,0.1499,1.6667,1.669,4.1711,1.3226,7.4527,3.8089,0.9246,1.5606,0.0112,0.0018,4.3824,5.938,1.0245,1.0566,7.8732,2.1299,4.569,0.7907,0.3855,0.7803,3.0402,1.0348,5.9752,3.715,1.1758,0.1797,0.5261,0.0505,0.2074,3.7188,4.3695,0.4469,2.841,4.2709,1.4241,1.2179,0.0033,0.0022,3.1613,1.8016,0.2644,3.1931,1.9713,0.6278,6.1032,1.9113,0.1084,2.9661,2.1445,0.1802,5.0411,0.9624,0.9005]}

Upgrades on the remainder of the A47 route and a diversion scheme were finally completed in July 2000.\n\nLeckwith Interchange\n\nA dual carriageway interchange with the M4 motorway was built to serve Leckwith and the Leckwith Golf Club in the north-west of the town. The junction is located south-west of the present day Leckwith Interchange on Grangetown Link Road. The Leckwith Interchange has six gantry-level crossings to provide two link roads to provide links to Leckwith Golf Club and to the Leckwith railway station. The Grangetown and Leckwith Link Roads will eventually link to a future Leckwith and Penarth Roundabout on the south side of the M4 Motorway\nThe main interchange at Leckwith is also connected with the Swansea Bay Local Route M45.\n\nPenarth Interchange\n\nAnother interchange was built to serve the Penarth railway station at Penarth, 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) west of the former Leckwith Interchange.\nThe two lane dual carriageway interchange located south-west of the original Leckwith Interchange is now completely covered.\nThe original Leckwith Interchange remains open and continues to provide a dual carriageway link to the Leckwith Golf Club and to Leckwith Railway Station. A short section of Grangetown Link Road remains in use, connecting a short section of the existing dual carriageway with the A47. A junction also exists between the A47 and the Grangetown Loop, allowing traffic from the A47 to be diverted to the Grangetown Loop instead of leaving Grangetown Link Road. Grangetown Loop Route 3 is used as a part of the Penarth Loop.","token_len":523,"entropy":[6.696,10.7903,6.5612,4.7457,11.9943,8.1504,3.527,7.1692,5.5649,0.701,3.981,4.6719,5.4738,2.6752,10.1438,6.9651,4.6206,0.5032,9.1971,4.9237,2.8437,13.7966,6.1429,5.4795,9.0592,5.7331,7.3987,7.2914,3.3691,6.0218,4.2088,8.0662,10.3619,5.3614,5.2763,1.7084,6.6913,3.5182,6.2714,6.6251,9.3163,9.2672,0.7372,2.3079,7.8793,6.1054,0.7117,2.2133,5.2346,1.6473,2.665,6.1942,6.0146,1.2136,0.2222,0.6082,3.0049,0.2331,1.6652,1.1471,1.0208,8.0835,3.5016,2.8122,3.9106,0.1781,0.1247,0.1589,2.0359,0.1791,2.1215,0.6942,2.9256,0.0705,0.0625,0.198,0.5367,0.1085,0.4517,0.1957,3.4131,5.6449,0.0133,0.76,5.6528,7.1446,5.6886,2.8469,5.6002,5.9617,5.0561,0.4517,4.8329,3.7123,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,1.8922,1.8201,0.0192,7.8817,1.0424,0.0002,1.562,6.3388,5.6836,3.8287,0.0252,0.0013,0.0005,8.2991,0.0051,1.3783,3.6178,0.0091,0.0514,4.4935,0.3648,0.0014,1.8606,8.8474,0.9894,2.9543,3.1083,2.4655,0.0253,1.9197,6.43,2.3248,3.3137,5.4158,0.0234,3.2234,2.6023,7.677,3.4838,0.0837,0.0015,0.0433,1.5028,3.7057,0.8082,6.1523,3.3889,0.4384,8.12,1.3835,4.4644,0.8478,7.7873,0.0838,0.1465,2.7936,0.3147,4.9107,4.5417,2.8497,7.0709,4.75,1.6985,7.2124,1.2116,0.3791,3.305,2.6786,0.4483,0.906,0.0002,6.4662,0.0213,0.0287,2.2269,0.0073,1.4005,0.0001,3.0375,5.872,0.0834,0.0008,0.0012,0.0008,7.3885,3.6349,1.8046,5.2494,2.9727,3.8134,0.0224,1.1126,2.1027,3.7475,3.512,4.0582,0.0089,0.0601,1.5539,3.0457,4.5476,0.1196,0.1074,8.0376,2.0215,3.0185,2.4283,3.8874,1.952,0.6195,0.5052,1.2194,2.979,0.5956,1.3465,3.9774,2.5882,3.1835,5.063,1.9222,0.9693,0.0575,1.3236,6.4368,4.4642,3.512,0.0465,0.2399,3.4707,0.0051,3.5417,5.4797,0.0597,0.0082,0.0029,3.145,0.0633,0.8128,1.7531,5.6333,0.0075,0.0176,0.642,0.0061,3.347,5.9345,8.4704,3.8362,3.8337,3.1664,2.2963,3.566,3.3829,4.7774,9.0531,4.0442,2.4722,4.2629,6.3442,1.4435,4.4861,0.018,0.1912,2.4783,0.0763,0.9871,3.1963,1.3521,3.8218,0.0149,0.0467,7.7451,1.2691,0.4378,1.5296,5.8646,0.0103,0.008,0.0049,5.0977,2.508,0.034,0.0179,4.8748,1.906,4.6089,5.8216,1.9669,1.633,2.9296,5.1316,3.9676,0.0074,0.0403,4.3811,0.5764,0.0077,9.7174,0.3189,4.5887,0.9071,2.7638,1.8181,0.0569,0.5072,3.8428,0.1755,4.4804,0.0044,6.0317,17.3514,4.0758,2.9164,3.2202,1.8585,0.0043,0.0192,1.5326,4.2231,2.5711,2.4552,0.6307,6.7587,1.8924,7.8994,5.1887,6.8112,6.4015,2.1175,1.3707,0.0002,3.6894,0.0006,2.3893,0.0037,0.1129,0.0002,4.5289,2.2163,2.6757,1.0553,1.7327,0.5041,2.2668,1.4124,0.0016,5.591,0.2696,2.7765,0.6781,0.001,3.377,8.3717,2.2724,3.1555,1.6104,1.7279,2.0677,18.0138,0.4392,0.1131,2.423,0.2193,1.2418,5.2392,2.3623,0.018,0.0315,1.1688,0.0041,0.5393,1.987,10.2738,4.8722,3.933,5.1079,0.0309,0.0013,0.0017,0.0073,2.7954,6.9361,2.2056,0.6392,0.2229,0.0183,0.5973,5.0472,0.7793,0.0025,0.0101,0.4287,0.0027,1.7034,1.7174,5.698,3.4645,2.6312,1.1067,9.3574,4.6484,1.1496,0.0033,0.0081,0.1549,0.004,6.9313,1.6445,2.1757,5.8943,0.1268,2.5607,2.0214,6.1092,0.1098,0.0016,0.0013,0.0005,2.3568,1.1344,1.1674,3.0647,0.0063,0.0148,1.3948,0.0277,1.0207,2.0848,3.0149,0.0037,0.0258,3.154,0.1455,0.4623,3.6808,4.8437,2.9542,0.2124,6.1069,0.0053,0.0021,0.002,0.3506,0.0228,4.1198,3.4016,0.7427,2.5788,5.8701,4.8164,3.1408,1.1832,0.0503,1.2246,3.6444,4.416,0.0177,0.0013,0.001,0.0025,1.9448,0.8423,3.9123,0.5441,3.0449,3.2607,4.6221,5.7163,1.4021,1.3189,0.7895,2.0609,0.3003,0.2941,1.6435,2.6754,0.0081,0.0089,0.0085,5.1409,2.6081,3.9902,3.9887,2.7737,1.2501,2.2758,0.2598,0.3953,4.2777,0.8975,0.8775,0.667,1.7886,0.002,0.0035,0.0069,0.3825,5.5287,0.3005,4.5864,4.1463,0.0012,0.0009,0.0053,0.2967,0.0325,0.5058,6.2892,0.0029,0.0014,0.0014,1.5022,6.6731,4.6335,1.1448,4.2397,2.1537,0.8214,5.9014,0.0053,0.2852,6.3092,0.003,2.3376,1.3104]}
{"prompt":"Metal Gear Solid is often recognized as one of the key titles involved in popularizing the stealth game genre . The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies","text":"Metal Gear Solid is often recognized as one of the key titles involved in popularizing the stealth game genre. The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies while infiltrating a hostile environment (hence stealth) had already begun to appear in the early 1970s with Metal Gear (1975), and would be taken up in much more sophisticated detail in a much later entry on the series. The game would also be a major influence behind the works of many of the game film directors, with the director of the 1986 film version being a fan of the original title.\nThe story of Metal Gear Solid starts in the fictional United States of America as MGS-0, a secretive military unit being sent around the world to spy on certain revolutionary movements. Its job is to take down rebel leaders and protect the status quo. In the story, MGS-0 infiltrates a secret facility in a former Soviet Union base, which is used by the rebels to manufacture war machines for the cause. After receiving a special order from headquarters, the mission is to infiltrate the facility and find some vital information that can be used to help the rebels. MGS-0 eventually manages to establish itself at the facility in an attempt to find out how an operation called Black Sky was conducted.\nThe game revolves around MGS-0's struggle to achieve this objective; as the player progresses the game he is able to unlock new abilities as the game progresses. The story follows the story of two characters that are connected to each other and the setting. In one part of the story the character of Solid Snake is given the task to find the mysterious man whose voice is heard in the game's cutscenes, Solid Snake is to try and find the man known as MGS-0. The MGS-0 character of the story can be accessed by beating the hardest levels of the campaign. It is said MGS-0 is the ultimate weapon of the United States government and will eventually be put to use by the President of the United States, making the story a real thriller. As Solid Snake progresses through the game, his own storyline becomes more apparent to the player. By the end of the fourth chapter, the original MGS-0 character has been replaced by his \"scarlet cross\" counterpart, who will eventually become a player choice on the main menu.\nAt the end of the campaign, the player will have to deal with certain side missions in order to complete the game. These are some of the most elaborate and interesting content for a first person shooter since the introduction of this genre in the eighties.","token_len":524,"entropy":[9.4415,0.2188,6.2977,6.5429,7.08,0.6263,0.6203,0.0119,0.0837,7.0613,3.9086,8.2699,0.1994,7.0124,2.5087,0.5999,5.2348,1.8161,0.8489,0.6651,2.1713,6.4211,1.5352,2.8072,6.1338,2.1363,8.8899,1.5773,3.8724,0.9516,4.4787,2.4654,4.0672,1.5379,2.1897,3.5951,5.8106,0.007,1.6991,3.6605,2.2722,4.8393,6.1964,0.0007,5.7961,2.023,5.0877,3.4746,3.2639,0.4891,3.3816,0.5967,0.9232,3.0428,6.5056,0.2264,3.1124,3.6926,0.001,6.4617,7.1898,1.5231,1.8211,5.1242,2.5258,5.401,0.6591,2.5349,5.5704,2.2523,4.7884,9.0999,1.139,4.1246,4.1149,1.1708,3.9832,4.7186,0.2991,0.8987,0.4436,2.3109,2.1403,3.4705,2.6091,1.7032,2.9065,2.0447,1.6191,7.3289,0.5819,9.2359,0.1169,3.9847,1.8005,0.2361,2.3435,9.7583,1.6815,1.3064,3.8689,2.2733,3.2922,1.3915,1.1906,6.2655,1.1539,5.9817,4.2893,3.8157,4.4555,0.15,0.6853,3.0353,5.5096,0.9467,0.9581,7.4937,4.4004,0.7005,0.6313,0.0006,0.0215,3.7708,2.0155,1.4778,4.7019,5.3736,0.0524,0.8457,0.0173,3.7992,7.9278,1.624,2.2105,4.8445,2.5797,1.0593,7.5768,2.5742,1.2745,6.4848,3.4884,7.0243,0.2327,0.2638,0.8575,5.8981,0.1194,6.3497,7.1781,2.1032,0.6407,5.4219,6.1051,0.3026,0.1811,4.5262,0.9311,6.4905,2.5404,1.4114,3.9598,1.3539,8.327,0.0113,1.4701,2.9302,1.303,4.9881,0.4877,2.0238,0.0096,0.2722,0.0444,4.8729,0.0026,0.8201,3.1312,2.1448,1.7398,2.4505,4.8397,2.0964,0.9308,3.9251,1.3735,2.9365,1.0131,3.0923,1.5075,0.9559,5.6515,0.6131,5.4933,6.7197,1.865,2.5638,1.3368,6.672,0.9342,3.2551,5.3512,1.6054,5.183,2.0339,0.2127,7.9473,1.3412,1.0656,3.9631,0.8018,0.8327,1.7386,0.7864,0.452,0.8425,2.8913,4.8676,6.333,0.7521,2.7976,2.4977,1.8449,0.3765,0.7772,3.6532,1.038,0.9144,1.6929,3.8522,0.0045,0.0843,0.0152,3.6159,3.4902,0.0199,6.753,2.3749,3.9227,0.5781,1.8775,3.4765,2.497,0.2133,0.0124,3.0962,1.9225,3.0657,6.2362,5.17,4.6377,4.8986,6.8503,2.6934,2.4776,0.9166,1.5547,1.4998,1.8157,5.6852,0.0076,3.0002,0.0083,0.1328,0.0324,1.1428,5.6634,1.1685,5.1463,4.7843,2.1075,4.7547,3.1057,1.4996,2.46,3.8261,3.4681,0.5557,8.7727,2.5664,2.1792,0.0051,3.1828,1.8672,2.7502,3.6376,2.6832,1.5294,0.0935,0.5148,1.9795,4.4467,3.4175,0.9682,2.1698,0.1531,4.1984,2.8677,2.9018,1.8465,5.2131,1.1414,1.8532,0.0117,2.9188,2.6122,7.0586,2.4675,2.631,3.4046,4.0703,0.4169,0.0443,1.2096,1.9355,2.6645,2.7577,5.1785,0.0222,1.0136,4.9284,1.1978,2.4447,3.4635,2.8015,1.6274,4.476,4.4783,4.6683,4.4091,2.0197,2.0134,1.6216,0.4443,1.7684,2.0623,3.225,0.5128,2.2754,6.8283,0.152,2.8061,5.4147,5.0299,0.8985,2.5107,1.3614,1.503,6.9358,0.2193,3.5985,0.5657,0.1243,0.35,1.5676,1.8399,5.6901,0.0099,0.1362,0.0084,2.3137,3.2859,2.6069,2.605,4.5921,0.4673,4.8324,1.6646,6.1767,1.0118,8.0823,3.3549,1.262,0.7649,5.9707,1.2305,3.9565,0.5563,3.9137,6.3212,0.0061,0.0186,0.0051,1.6514,2.0202,4.679,2.8811,1.9848,0.7779,4.8652,0.1069,2.1508,1.7835,3.9017,3.4516,1.5333,5.9012,0.3054,1.1583,1.7209,0.6673,6.6386,0.7607,0.1176,0.0917,0.0091,2.1031,5.521,2.1464,3.9813,1.9339,4.4746,6.2634,0.6558,4.4624,4.4315,0.0233,3.6041,0.9104,0.2479,1.3459,1.0767,2.374,5.7695,6.2782,2.3,0.9111,5.4383,3.5977,1.6009,0.096,1.2196,5.2709,1.1393,0.7101,0.1062,0.1278,7.353,1.6238,1.141,1.2296,6.7876,2.8314,0.0015,0.2795,0.0215,1.2682,2.5122,0.9258,3.187,0.4006,3.8486,5.112,11.5164,0.3781,6.0265,0.8315,4.1216,1.0773,2.1634,3.3351,2.6991,1.4976,2.3115,5.9664,5.3996,4.6897,0.5592,3.1644,1.6965,0.5742,0.7728,4.8214,0.523,0.4979,0.0197,0.2366,3.0652,0.5585,1.1754,0.8743,1.3439,2.1864,1.2201,4.1185,0.005,5.7905,4.9807,1.1807,2.5675,0.9698,0.0191,2.412,1.1778,1.5316,0.5308,2.7417,2.897,4.9149,0.1305,0.0648,1.5291,6.4209,1.5838,3.3107,6.6019,4.6042,2.9367,3.7017,2.0505,0.4535,6.0971,1.0616,4.9058,0.0091,6.519,1.5593,1.6294,0.5249,8.6801,0.002,0.4484]}

Most people have strong opinions about breastfeeding and this causes controversy for the brand.

John Rothchild, who helped write her autobiography, said that her death was the only thing that could ``break my heart. `` She was the most popular woman in America, and the first to have a weekly magazine devoted to her image.\nA biography that was published last year explained the popularity of this icon: ``Her greatness is not so much that of her career of excellence as of the success of her public image. '' She was said to have had a large fan support.\nThe public is fascinated by the biography of a person who, for most of his life, had to live in the shadow of President Roosevelt's wife, and did not have a strong personality. In recent years, however, the world has discovered many personal mysteries about her life. Rothchild said that the author wrote about her biography on the grounds of ``truth and love. ``\nHowever, the main interest of the public was her personal life. For example, although she met General Pershing before her marriage, she left him after a short fling. In her biography, Rothchild said that she knew she was going to have an affair with him when a man asked to give her a key to his house. ``It was the kind of life she went through, `` she said.\nHowever, the real mystery of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's biography lies in her political life. Before her retirement from Congress, she had been married to Congressman Charles Elkins Douglas, who served four terms in the House. At the end of her first term in Congress, she married General Philip Sheridan Douglas and had two children from her marriage: Edward Jr. and William.\nShe divorced her first husband two months after the end of their divorce. Edward, who came to Washington, served as her assistant until the end of her term in Congress. She has been married to General William Stoneman Douglas from 1945, but divorced in 1962.\nDuring this period, she divorced her first husband. In her second marriage, she served as General Stoneman's wife until his death. After that, he continued to live with her, and there was no divorce filing. ``After he died, in 1964, John McCain had a huge following, said Marjory Stoneman Douglas in an interview with the New York Times. ``There was no record of us having a divorce case. He served for 45 years at his husband's side. They were married for 45 years and the couple separated before John had been a governor.","token_len":524,"entropy":[6.6374,2.5767,5.0824,4.6161,0.1453,11.3835,8.3085,2.5924,1.145,0.9558,0.0026,6.5616,2.1257,2.5954,3.5531,0.2399,4.9111,0.8517,6.8452,9.7029,3.9112,1.5365,2.1792,4.7314,3.8465,5.6173,2.2262,0.5581,3.9238,2.2733,2.8389,1.7597,0.8114,2.3494,4.412,2.7716,0.7073,2.6378,15.4796,4.5317,3.112,0.1673,3.9454,6.8582,2.4954,1.1288,2.4444,2.9213,3.4003,2.7023,0.6016,2.4935,1.6276,0.9349,2.7716,3.2941,2.4025,2.9481,1.316,8.6875,2.4688,3.6865,0.4138,0.5924,8.5251,0.3281,2.4187,10.053,5.586,4.3527,2.4373,1.1873,4.6443,0.5686,7.4014,2.017,8.1332,0.1445,4.2171,6.0397,1.7388,1.7024,3.213,7.2444,1.7342,2.7432,3.9913,0.2691,3.0236,1.2075,1.5275,5.2642,5.9361,5.3996,1.3968,1.3802,2.2953,4.4243,0.645,0.2998,4.9991,1.4825,1.0951,4.3121,2.2721,0.8167,6.717,0.0591,0.725,2.9914,1.2912,5.1167,4.831,8.6893,2.5762,1.4182,2.5122,5.7965,4.2468,5.101,0.6234,1.8501,6.3523,1.3241,3.6933,4.1551,1.0439,3.6318,2.6651,4.0782,0.409,4.4047,0.5417,0.1195,1.1462,4.786,2.713,1.5746,2.0953,1.5311,0.019,6.7247,3.3974,3.0698,5.1656,0.8007,4.3877,6.1698,0.7092,2.2731,1.7562,3.9018,6.2883,0.9764,3.2497,5.29,0.342,0.405,1.8937,0.0013,1.7329,6.4622,0.3147,4.7268,4.8347,7.4838,5.1506,0.9751,2.0859,1.4238,0.8616,7.7807,0.0057,1.5181,0.5301,2.3974,4.9154,5.2358,2.29,0.9235,7.0976,3.5164,1.6285,4.0996,2.3118,2.2546,6.3887,1.94,3.3262,3.9613,2.2708,1.94,6.61,0.1056,2.0827,5.6691,5.2171,0.8371,0.7564,3.3656,2.2194,1.8314,3.9475,0.7744,0.7509,4.4444,2.2646,0.0232,6.5837,0.7321,6.2084,9.2214,8.4468,0.0314,4.4326,1.7142,2.8906,0.7326,0.9698,5.5256,2.2625,3.0054,2.8149,2.709,10.1064,0.0223,2.0327,2.9918,2.2035,2.5635,0.3717,1.2218,0.0046,1.2582,0.415,1.0398,4.1509,4.1275,1.2049,2.8069,0.2747,2.7478,2.7878,0.101,0.24,4.4024,2.9318,6.1227,3.4437,3.6448,3.0452,5.6193,0.1254,0.9025,6.5136,0.5826,1.2477,2.1616,0.4823,3.328,3.0695,0.7272,2.9978,4.3218,0.0785,5.4558,1.9277,5.7758,0.4708,2.4522,6.172,1.064,0.2667,0.2366,1.2995,5.6552,0.0223,2.0077,3.9825,2.949,1.4639,7.7966,0.0036,0.0039,0.5602,0.001,0.002,0.0959,3.7746,3.5095,3.6966,0.4488,1.1096,5.2147,2.6173,0.4263,6.1545,1.2043,5.0038,1.0367,3.2991,0.8325,0.5462,2.0226,1.236,3.7303,0.239,4.5246,3.6655,7.662,3.63,6.6743,0.7838,1.3657,2.6638,3.458,0.1631,1.4765,0.8528,0.4175,1.6854,4.1722,0.7282,2.9246,0.0032,0.749,3.6196,0.079,1.6829,0.6499,0.1289,0.6719,3.3415,5.3328,4.9417,5.7963,1.8662,3.7118,1.5807,1.5938,0.3194,5.0435,1.7904,0.6704,4.3305,5.053,7.378,1.119,0.7941,4.5038,1.1202,1.7572,2.8586,6.4776,1.698,1.979,0.1566,6.7691,2.5572,0.7403,1.6304,3.6462,0.0018,2.7462,5.3571,1.0918,6.2827,3.2299,1.0592,5.7569,0.5695,2.9694,3.1977,5.508,1.1882,3.1097,4.8393,4.3684,2.2613,0.8221,0.0327,0.851,1.7972,1.2247,0.3786,0.379,1.8878,4.4116,2.1862,0.9937,0.7574,1.8805,2.4185,5.5853,0.8282,0.0059,0.2702,5.0462,4.6592,4.4684,3.3898,5.2789,3.1409,3.843,0.5058,1.4412,3.8863,3.6795,1.2113,0.3419,0.8147,5.5622,1.1109,1.3341,0.1762,2.7713,2.5808,2.7286,3.2733,0.8632,0.3067,0.5185,6.8022,0.3492,2.8053,5.2571,0.0087,0.0017,2.0202,3.6652,2.5385,3.1237,0.1088,1.2701,4.0111,2.025,0.2148,3.9123,5.5867,0.5949,2.964,1.4844,0.3087,2.1874,1.3674,5.0336,1.0914,1.5248,2.9941,6.1601,1.1371,7.4602,4.8772,3.3984,0.4078,0.3617,5.2331,3.452,0.0972,5.9475,6.8262,3.9962,2.1367,5.6231,4.848,2.0589,7.7796,5.4842,0.0057,0.007,0.5717,0.0025,0.003,0.4584,3.7548,1.087,0.275,1.2756,1.0728,2.2839,0.182,0.2887,0.4133,0.8095,4.0205,0.6906,1.8976,5.2711,0.3426,7.0096,1.2245,1.2853,2.7671,6.5906,1.4472,2.5955,6.5573,3.2757,5.6887,0.055,4.5251,3.9631,7.2362,0.163,0.2138,1.1177,4.3562,1.777,1.7633,1.1154,2.3966,0.0736,2.7,3.716,2.8583,4.8586,5.591,5.3803,4.2403,3.432,4.2862,5.6211,0.9157]}

Species may also be < unk > < unk > at higher altitudes due to the temperature difference between < unk > < unk > altitudes in < unk > < unk >, low humidity or other abiotic factors. It may also be that < unk > < unk > and therefore < unk > < unk > are < unk > < unk >. Both M. polymorpha and < unk > < unk > had many species. Both < unk > < unk > have many species but are likely < unk > < unk >. Only < unk > < unk > had < unk > < unk > species not found to date. All three plants were found in montane forests at < unk > < unk >, however, the plants < unk > < unk > < unk > < unk > mountain forests. These forests, like others of the Sierra Nevada, are found below the 3000 m elevation in mountain areas where plants with adapted traits for growth at lower elevations cannot survive in forests dominated by species adapted to higher elevations (Kellogg & Kursar, 1989). Therefore the < unk > < unk > species were generally found in areas outside of the range of < unk > < unk >. This suggests that < unk > < unk > is similar to the other species in the < unk > < unk > of the Sierra Nevada in the relative abundance by < unk > < unk > and altitudes of their occurrence. Thus it appears that < unk > < unk >, M. polymorpha and Marchantia neotropica, do not show differences due to altitude, but may do so due to area of occurrence or other possible factors.","token_len":525,"entropy":[3.4462,5.1001,7.1434,11.9703,7.9094,0.7975,5.0236,0.0044,9.9719,10.7394,6.2658,4.7253,4.2445,1.7329,0.1207,0.4194,1.9452,13.177,3.8678,3.8266,6.6441,4.4127,1.2892,1.4031,12.1614,9.1738,0.6464,0.0041,0.0448,3.8354,7.0044,0.615,0.0018,0.0622,3.7251,0.3935,0.0046,0.0536,3.2518,4.089,11.361,8.217,3.6744,7.3995,2.9616,0.4269,0.9573,5.8868,0.2514,5.3548,2.6722,6.3623,2.795,9.5261,3.4504,5.274,1.7506,3.8573,1.9118,1.3291,4.4291,6.2142,10.9918,0.3044,0.0023,0.0515,3.2118,0.0948,0.0018,0.0212,8.729,4.1687,2.7371,1.1304,1.9208,4.0032,2.7628,1.439,5.5091,6.2952,0.0982,0.0029,0.0161,3.5645,0.1117,0.0038,0.0257,8.3637,3.691,0.5705,1.3994,9.261,1.0862,6.978,8.6744,5.5274,3.0086,0.8487,3.8023,6.055,0.4237,1.4369,5.5262,0.0162,3.413,5.45,8.7167,7.3789,3.4955,7.7148,3.425,9.2088,0.0404,2.4728,4.6253,1.6292,8.6739,0.1956,0.001,0.0117,3.331,0.0431,0.0011,0.0125,2.4229,1.7063,11.1597,0.1868,0.0012,0.0061,2.6263,0.1801,0.0016,0.0113,5.937,8.4494,0.1563,0.0019,0.0166,3.4255,6.0323,0.0917,0.0014,0.0041,1.3456,0.1112,0.0016,0.0191,1.9631,7.3158,4.5672,2.0182,0.6762,5.5857,0.0775,0.0014,0.0092,3.1216,0.0838,0.0014,0.0075,4.2707,1.7889,0.6381,0.0001,4.193,0.0033,1.9603,7.2303,1.9479,0.812,1.5753,0.0396,0.0015,0.0032,0.8515,0.0116,0.0012,0.0049,5.429,0.0112,4.4389,4.5845,0.0887,0.0016,0.009,4.3401,0.0948,0.0014,0.0082,3.8537,6.8477,3.4261,4.069,3.2483,8.3515,0.2382,1.7665,0.7392,3.9336,2.1427,0.9711,0.2216,1.0329,1.862,0.0089,0.0014,0.0043,1.0468,0.011,0.0011,0.0029,4.2038,7.939,0.3508,0.0444,0.0019,0.016,3.2457,0.0904,0.0017,0.0162,0.8268,4.4206,0.142,0.0013,0.0026,2.6994,0.1166,0.0016,0.0047,3.2094,5.8713,7.5388,0.6487,1.6219,0.459,0.0055,0.24,1.0785,0.038,0.0014,0.0032,4.0368,0.0109,0.001,0.0036,6.6856,5.2926,4.2171,4.4337,4.5522,3.7731,0.025,0.0021,0.0039,1.042,0.0076,0.0011,0.004,3.0041,4.1087,2.5536,4.3366,2.5937,5.2002,2.1097,0.0111,0.0008,0.0024,0.3204,0.0134,0.0011,0.0035,3.4596,5.4091,1.4019,0.0078,0.0012,0.0026,0.3061,0.0078,0.0011,0.0029,4.6552,2.606,0.0316,0.0011,0.0053,0.7134,0.0427,0.0015,0.0077,3.8871,6.5637,2.4818,5.2675,2.7607,0.5823,4.6577,3.6836,6.703,1.8875,2.2386,1.3372,5.2328,0.0298,0.8989,4.4168,1.1537,0.0433,0.0008,0.0046,0.4778,0.0191,0.0009,0.0064,3.4669,5.2429,0.9158,2.2354,4.1906,4.0357,0.0133,0.0013,0.0032,0.3176,0.01,0.001,0.003,5.4726,0.063,0.0015,0.0042,4.7951,0.0732,0.0019,0.005,11.254,5.2036,2.3306,3.5337,3.1498,3.8607,4.5544,4.8311,2.6272,0.5536,6.673,0.372,0.856,1.1949,5.4442,5.9474,1.203,10.4778,0.8329,0.9389,3.2952,5.9625,3.2253,3.6368,5.5584,5.3445,6.783,5.2752,3.9957,3.3856,5.1429,3.3568,3.3239,0.0004,5.7473,2.7113,2.0666,5.9565,7.0684,0.024,6.199,6.3724,0.5202,2.0557,1.3699,0.0081,1.7862,3.9654,5.3595,3.2791,2.9136,4.383,8.2539,5.4338,0.1569,3.4926,0.5486,5.4931,3.411,2.3548,0.0089,0.0014,0.0041,0.0928,0.0063,0.0011,0.0039,3.6535,2.7549,5.5053,1.3063,0.7933,4.1744,6.7637,0.8056,0.9512,3.136,0.329,0.8613,0.0065,0.0009,0.0034,0.8269,0.0115,0.0013,0.0062,1.5405,3.7199,2.9819,0.1896,1.4887,0.0081,0.0015,0.0027,0.0599,0.0064,0.0013,0.0031,2.9988,5.391,0.2405,1.7621,4.8698,2.8652,2.1006,0.7595,3.5124,0.0137,0.001,0.0032,0.3046,0.011,0.0011,0.0071,6.9783,0.6032,0.6113,0.0186,3.6716,2.6896,6.0273,1.274,8.5747,4.0023,0.0215,0.0009,0.0032,0.429,0.0095,0.001,0.0043,2.1562,8.2519,0.0279,1.9405,5.5802,7.8487,0.9294,5.0379,3.3842,2.8114,0.2824,0.7367,0.0071,0.0013,0.0019,0.0249,0.0052,0.0012,0.0022,5.0954,5.97,0.0064,0.1391,0.0002,0.0018,0.7316,3.6038,0.0008,0.0002,7.6116,4.7374,0.3381,1.0873,4.5451,0.4338,3.3375,5.396,5.4257,0.0035,3.2844,2.311,1.841,2.7107,5.7651,1.14,1.3401,0.006,8.7525,1.5479,3.8399,3.3256,2.8824,6.8166,0.5857,0.5122]}

A modern folktale by noted Yangzhou storyteller Wang Shaotang ( 1889 \u2013 1968 ), whom folklore researcher Vibeke < unk > Tveit in 1979 refers < n > to as \u201cone of the principal storytellers of China \u201d, was entitled < u > A Young Man and the Dragon. It was recorded by Wang in 1947. Its theme is taken < u > from the Chinese play The Dragon and the Pavilion, from which the Chinese term denghu ( dragon ) is derived, or dengli ( pavilion ). The story was originally a poem in two parts by Cao Xuanqiu, who had written numerous poem collections and contributed to the compilation of Han classics.\nThe story begins somewhat abruptly, with the narrator revealing his identity and his purpose in coming to tell his story : \u201c I have come from the West, \u201d he announces, \u201c so come at once to see a dragon, a very young and handsome youth. \u201d Following a dialogue, the narrator enters the field and discovers a young man who is in fact the dragon. He tells the story by adding the parts of its action previously known only to the young man.\nThe tale\u2019s main motive is not a magical transformation or an encounter with an animal god. If this were the case, the \u201c spirit of an emperor \u201d and the young man\u2019s transformation would have been part of a ritual ; neither is involved. It is the search, by the young man, for the emperor\u2019s \u201c secret message \u201d in the form of a secret \u201c formula of art \u201d which would open the way to immortality.

This was being used by the laboratories at Berkeley and Los Alamos for cerium sulphide, which was used to make neutron absorbers for fission weapons. The Ames Project needed enough cerium for only six days, but with the use of the old Klineberg and Bromine techniques, the Ames Project was able to produce a sufficient quantity for the entire world, and soon enough the war ended.\nIn 1946, when Ames was still working for the government, he published an article in \" Physical Review \" which showed that the rare earth elements were arranged on their periodic table in order of electronegativity. He published the theory again in 1947 in a book which is still published.\nHe worked for the government until 1951. He published an important textbook on atomic physics, and also helped develop a nuclear reactor, which is still used today.\nHe was the first chairman of the atomic energy commission, which later became the Department of Energy. In 1981, he returned to the Ames Lab to test his ideas, which resulted in the discovery of \" cosmic rays \" which, in theory, should have been detected 25 years before but for the short life of the cosmic ray detectors.\nHe retired in 1985 and died in 1991.\nWhat is Ames Energy\nHis theory was based on what he called the atomic clock.\nHe postulated that the nuclei in an atom vibrate rhythmically, and that this has to keep in line with natural rhythm of the atom. The rate of vibrating determines the atomic energy.\nSo, for a given atom, we have to know the atomic clock : the number of vibrations per second of the atom. The more vibrations, the more energy.\nA second of atomic clock time is the time taken for 24 vibrations of the atom.\nFor atoms with even number of protons with which we have atomic clocks :\nAmes energy = mass in grams \u00d7 second of atomic clock time \u00d7 1.66066 \u00d7 10\u221212 The units is electron volts.\nThe mass in grams is the mass of the atom in grams.\nA more precise way of measuring the power of an atom is to measure the speed of electrons. The speed is proportional to the square root of the mass. An idea of how the measurement can be done is shown here : A very high powered ion beam passes through the atom, the electrons are bombarded and they leave a trail of ions in the chamber.\nThe number of ions per second is proportional to the number of electrons escaping from the atom.","token_len":526,"entropy":[8.5413,13.794,8.786,4.4781,10.071,2.1682,2.3267,11.7397,8.106,1.6965,6.6682,0.3156,3.8129,9.6629,7.0542,3.4449,2.9882,1.1393,6.3053,2.0127,2.6988,0.9474,9.7464,2.4301,5.2915,1.5536,4.5849,0.0458,0.0024,2.5193,4.5347,0.0262,9.5325,1.1063,2.4618,1.8871,0.8891,1.9486,1.776,1.1379,7.2154,4.9325,0.3106,1.9227,6.5566,0.0977,3.0816,0.3674,1.6627,3.1462,0.9771,6.0499,6.6448,3.226,0.002,2.0797,5.7175,4.9652,5.2439,1.8515,1.7898,4.4631,1.654,4.2707,0.005,2.3433,7.3757,6.959,6.0738,8.5789,4.1626,8.8806,6.2244,6.1457,1.016,1.5833,3.614,0.9784,1.6672,0.1221,0.0078,0.7692,2.3104,4.829,1.0093,1.9068,2.6706,3.8632,4.1911,3.1009,1.897,5.9009,2.4944,1.7152,4.9403,3.1387,0.5722,1.2391,5.2867,3.5513,0.6007,4.0734,5.242,1.3193,2.6141,2.6328,2.8944,0.7433,4.1927,0.671,2.4217,5.5577,2.4156,0.6655,1.691,4.2457,9.9441,1.6613,3.6024,1.9631,3.2858,0.5582,1.33,8.2641,1.7817,3.3285,2.143,8.9118,3.4949,4.1033,5.6191,0.8996,2.2611,3.135,2.2998,10.2147,4.0293,0.5322,0.2425,0.9331,2.2896,5.5888,1.7501,5.4206,6.578,0.512,2.4227,3.4119,2.0143,2.1638,3.0476,3.1831,1.1586,3.585,1.7053,1.6453,3.3819,5.7244,2.08,1.0976,2.6349,2.5455,3.6556,1.9177,1.2245,4.6812,2.9332,3.7518,7.1822,1.1857,2.8573,1.1821,2.1135,2.8033,3.5097,5.1902,2.4023,2.0459,5.0535,2.5176,2.6431,1.5813,2.6514,0.9573,1.8971,0.6961,0.482,1.2759,1.6392,1.2924,2.8913,1.6698,6.6469,0.0742,0.2087,4.2944,2.5009,1.7744,1.3085,1.8773,4.8535,1.0006,0.3377,4.1856,0.0341,0.7315,0.5409,2.7627,5.7398,0.5637,0.4329,5.9998,0.1144,1.2319,1.3104,6.1918,1.7428,6.8511,2.124,3.4832,2.2315,2.3849,4.3274,0.0075,0.7125,3.0737,0.1094,5.3329,8.6507,1.5845,1.2484,1.6176,4.0742,1.6057,4.2415,0.0384,4.2942,2.4691,1.298,4.38,8.5943,0.9152,2.6375,7.3629,2.7941,1.4383,7.0161,6.438,0.5776,0.601,6.4948,0.5294,3.4775,0.485,0.833,1.287,5.0441,1.0739,3.0443,2.0289,3.2923,0.6609,3.6203,0.5055,0.9019,5.4498,1.7986,8.6904,6.7746,3.9685,4.3488,4.6528,1.8373,1.5414,0.1238,4.713,0.9188,0.9971,1.3352,5.0838,5.1227,1.3829,2.6897,1.657,8.7974,0.1639,0.3474,1.239,7.6807,0.4777,2.1781,3.8163,0.4722,6.4393,0.059,8.7118,0.0549,1.5441,1.7349,1.2594,2.2813,6.1273,2.1983,8.122,4.4114,4.0118,0.0468,6.108,4.7662,2.3772,0.6786,2.2194,0.713,2.3434,5.6806,0.5027,2.49,1.2398,6.3885,0.3747,4.0972,3.0801,1.7652,0.929,5.1548,1.4103,2.8568,3.2387,2.6175,2.2963,0.6543,4.8476,1.8382,2.3327,3.7811,1.5264,2.9562,1.1195,9.4696,2.2715,3.4574,0.1452,5.8513,2.5119,0.4017,3.91,0.6334,0.5229,1.0827,2.1269,3.7329,0.5335,1.204,0.0505,1.0253,0.472,2.4708,1.0619,4.0736,4.112,2.7112,4.4629,2.5227,2.8236,1.3768,2.7152,1.8744,4.2956,1.8737,9.1382,5.6172,2.2112,0.6698,1.0098,1.0636,1.0897,3.523,5.3017,2.2657,7.1609,4.4624,0.0882,5.8007,0.0022,6.8115,5.0658,2.8177,1.8454,4.1643,1.4444,6.5511,1.9793,7.2854,0.039,3.1828,1.6519,6.9262,4.9334,3.269,6.2375,7.3004,0.7842,1.069,0.0486,0.3897,2.9138,3.5107,1.6011,8.9617,6.9174,3.8997,2.1734,2.8994,3.359,7.4098,6.7332,5.7102,7.5781,2.1728,1.364,0.8266,2.1034,3.7141,1.9363,0.3867,1.226,1.2047,1.4441,0.469,0.8939,1.0252,2.1418,1.5064,0.7045,0.556,3.5052,5.6978,2.4119,3.2961,0.4764,2.4208,1.1059,5.0002,0.3575,1.8133,0.2042,0.5012,0.8067,1.4331,0.6809,3.5901,0.6431,4.0297,1.6381,2.0582,1.0885,2.2789,2.7849,0.0139,0.2262,3.6812,0.5144,0.0554,0.3186,2.5357,1.5917,4.8957,7.1685,1.4369,2.3153,2.3064,7.4993,2.7688,0.1203,0.8301,0.6042,3.7643,3.1364,2.9939,4.254,5.5146,3.7556,6.8644,5.5312,3.8461,4.9343,0.5837,1.3117,1.5283,1.8656,4.7541,3.164,1.7483,9.964,0.1097,3.4213,3.5992,6.0108,1.877,1.3908,0.7082,5.2076,2.158,0.4085,7.5784,0.6338,1.6736,1.4173,4.4883,0.0978,1.0505,4.7267,1.5287,0.6727,2.9548,0.0127,0.1286,2.2877,0.0133,3.1858,10.2518,1.3244,0.1593,0.4319,0.507]}

The elderly are at an increased risk of dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory loss and visual field defects which they usually develop with the prolonged use.\nAn important feature of benzodiazepine-induced dependence is the development of a tolerance. This makes it a challenge to achieve therapeutic goals and also reduces the effectiveness of treatment.\nThe major adverse effects of benzodiazepines include withdrawal syndrome, dependence, sedation, dizziness, and sleepiness. They can also lead to motor incoordination, impaired gait and loss of awareness.\nIn older patients, prolonged use of benzodiazepines can be associated with increased risk of hip fractures. They may also cause gastrointestinal complications because of their sedative properties or to the altered gastrointestinal motility.\nOver-the-counter benzodiazepines like diazepam and clonazepam may be available and used for the treatment of nervousness. These benzodiazepines should not be used for the treatment or management of anxiety, because their efficacy may not be comparable to that of a benzodiazepine drug recommended for anxiety.\nIf required, benzodiazepines should be prescribed by a physician and should not be taken without consulting a physician.\nOne of the commonly used over-the-counter products, diazepam, belongs to the class of medicines known as central nervous system depressants (CNS depressant drugs). A CNS depressant drug is a type of medication used to treat seizures, anxiety, and depression.\nWhen taken under medical supervision, diazepam works to relax muscles, relieve pain, induce sleep, and reduce anxiety. However, excessive intake of diazepam can cause side effects that can be very unpleasant. These include anxiety, nervousness, drowsiness, confusion, and impaired vision.\nBecause diazepam induces sleep as well as sedation, it can impair patients\u2019 memory, attention, and judgment. As a result, it is unsafe to drive or operate machinery while using this medicine.\nThe most common drug-related emergency is a \u201c drowsy driving \u201c incident in which car accidents are more likely to occur when the driver is drowsy. It is possible to develop dependence on diazepam over the course of treatment because of its therapeutic effectiveness and safety.\nWhen an adult with anxiety disorders takes benzodiazepines, they can be safe and effective. However when used inappropriately or abused for non-medical purposes, they can become dangerous and cause addiction.","token_len":526,"entropy":[8.8602,0.5656,10.0645,0.2789,0.0016,0.404,1.4032,9.9067,6.9224,3.0846,2.3748,0.89,1.859,1.6296,1.5896,2.7091,0.8719,2.3981,5.7587,1.5292,2.4443,3.425,0.2198,0.0047,0.8322,5.7642,1.8429,3.4165,2.0557,4.7592,0.0697,1.6345,4.2567,0.2689,6.5205,0.0115,4.4722,0.5034,0.9685,7.5355,8.5496,4.0425,5.1868,4.8081,5.9294,3.4144,3.0528,2.5436,8.5453,0.4375,2.8502,1.2818,12.5801,3.14,4.4931,0.1235,1.3661,0.0038,0.0001,1.9455,4.991,0.922,3.8393,0.2191,1.4717,5.0506,0.0452,2.3759,1.6421,2.2051,1.9113,6.5591,1.12,3.6009,4.6687,0.2793,4.5706,4.839,4.0306,2.1974,4.6537,4.1329,0.391,3.2636,0.0997,3.0173,0.6015,1.7091,1.8399,5.2285,3.5296,0.373,0.3761,0.1693,0.0009,0.0,0.1461,1.2434,4.2337,4.0124,0.4444,5.7708,0.7123,5.5961,0.0342,0.4182,3.5393,0.0008,0.342,2.4536,4.263,3.0541,0.2092,3.5862,1.5665,1.413,2.5913,0.0137,5.611,3.989,0.0761,0.0098,0.7876,4.2297,8.5618,0.021,1.6005,5.3338,0.0042,5.3542,0.6589,0.908,3.1899,5.0079,1.3173,0.4995,6.0017,0.8938,0.4687,0.3013,0.0014,0.0001,0.0736,0.9863,2.8626,1.8678,0.0054,2.7681,1.3061,0.1186,8.6397,1.2282,2.095,4.1216,2.1166,0.4279,1.8314,6.1047,3.4243,5.9624,0.677,2.5616,3.7309,0.4238,1.7909,5.7329,3.9006,2.5387,6.7536,4.4094,3.8904,0.002,0.8032,0.6097,5.8264,2.4348,1.2125,0.0101,0.0183,0.7469,0.0023,0.0002,0.1537,4.7645,4.0638,0.0215,0.0018,1.9457,4.0328,1.019,0.1839,0.0006,0.0003,1.9984,1.5311,4.7481,4.6562,3.788,2.2861,2.129,0.4155,0.0126,8.3053,3.1489,2.3113,2.997,3.7975,0.0025,0.001,0.0652,3.7866,0.9716,0.0552,0.8914,1.4208,1.18,0.3468,4.8773,3.2501,0.0025,2.6499,1.8387,5.2776,3.2062,5.2711,2.4966,2.1352,0.1435,2.8154,0.646,1.9789,0.1942,3.2246,1.4328,0.0064,0.0005,0.0585,5.4131,9.394,0.6967,3.3126,1.0047,0.4526,4.2682,7.2963,0.4618,1.1887,0.0016,0.0005,0.1155,1.039,0.5355,3.1345,2.7398,0.6628,2.0137,2.8477,2.7545,1.2116,0.1247,1.1686,2.8641,3.9162,0.8849,1.9844,0.6379,0.9357,5.4478,1.0888,0.0124,7.8635,0.5161,6.194,0.1215,0.0028,0.001,0.0002,5.6264,3.0593,2.814,0.079,0.006,0.2935,6.3274,0.0993,0.1363,1.0788,0.3082,5.9198,2.3031,0.0616,6.3647,0.2365,0.6234,1.9083,0.0425,1.677,0.1215,0.0031,5.7908,5.0943,2.1112,0.4445,4.2735,3.6483,0.0368,0.0018,2.4735,0.6699,0.7381,4.1952,0.0105,2.2499,2.0499,0.6741,0.8838,4.5401,1.1867,2.3582,0.4726,1.7291,1.8588,0.3055,1.5078,4.489,2.526,3.0626,3.9467,0.0287,0.3319,2.5531,0.0024,0.0074,5.7209,2.6911,3.2295,4.5256,1.8231,2.5879,1.8742,0.3469,5.8906,2.8257,0.4897,0.7955,1.9963,2.2473,0.3432,3.388,0.0164,6.6293,6.4433,0.3079,1.9705,0.001,0.0095,0.8253,1.1989,3.3077,0.0206,2.9309,1.4177,1.6637,3.7558,3.169,0.687,2.775,0.9819,4.1652,0.3453,5.0827,0.0392,0.0517,5.3325,0.0206,0.0,0.0544,3.7176,0.078,1.4791,5.4741,2.7584,0.2062,0.591,4.1002,2.0962,0.0005,0.0096,6.2104,4.7418,6.8712,0.2311,0.0233,5.3267,0.0407,0.3551,0.9969,1.5942,5.2715,6.9483,14.5864,8.6694,9.0131,0.7084,2.3444,0.1636,0.713,4.7034,0.2686,4.4068,0.7857,0.1686,0.0645,2.5777,0.8396,7.9382,0.4093,5.8704,1.673,2.9545,2.9487,3.272,1.5008,3.2831,3.652,0.2361,0.7057,2.5181,2.8696,0.5842,5.8172,4.4423,1.1665,5.9531,3.5434,2.8396,16.1273,6.4957,8.5523,4.9055,0.0027,5.5482,6.0457,0.3804,5.7722,3.1414,0.3418,6.8602,2.7598,1.6035,4.752,1.1046,0.9013,0.3425,3.5429,2.2105,0.9216,0.8005,4.3438,0.0343,0.0063,0.8694,3.8516,0.4195,3.481,1.0721,4.1681,5.9201,0.7864,2.0343,3.0261,0.009,4.8442,1.1635,1.7392,0.0008,6.5444,3.4871,0.8083,1.3331,6.097,4.4815,2.0625,2.3842,0.6342,0.6263,4.1848,4.1524,5.0231,2.9658,4.8169,4.0916,3.8646,1.8075,0.0012,0.0001,0.3382,0.646,1.1104,2.7114,2.5096,8.0562,1.1377,0.3096,0.9729,1.6461,9.1138,3.6185,3.7208,2.8275,5.6415,3.4918,5.6369,0.2002,1.3021,0.7888,0.1346,1.432,0.4342,3.4533,1.6158,1.2761,2.1568,5.3827,0.6871]}

As a result, they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works. The first major adaptation of the book to the screen was in 1959 in a movie starring Peter O\u2019Toole. Directed by Peter Godfrey and starring Peter O\u2019Toole. It was a great success.\nWith over forty percent of us spending as much time in the bathroom as on any other room in the home, (according to the American Housing Survey for 2016), it\u2019s no surprise that bathrooms are the top selling feature in the modern home. Today, we have access to everything it takes soaking away those busy days and chores, and it\u2019s a space that should be a pleasure. The latest trends and modern ideas are out there, and we want to help you create one that you love. Here are a few quick suggestions on how to make bathrooms you\u2019ll love to enjoy.\nAside from the standard bathing routine of the soaking tub, sink and shower, there are so many more options! We especially think that a tub and shower combo can be a great addition to any bathroom, offering the luxury of a spa-like shower while having the relaxing sensation of a heated tub! This option is great for those that want the beauty of a traditional shower while taking full advantage of a spa-like bathroom. You can take advantage of any of these options in any size or style, including some of the latest trends. Just choose a bathroom that\u2019s just right for you!\nWith a few of these modern ideas, and some of your own design flair, you could certainly create the perfect spa bathroom that will be the envy of others.\nThe modern bathrooms we\u2019ve been speaking about today also have more functional fittings than ever. It used to be that you may only be able to use your sink to rinse your hands or brush your teeth, but the things we\u2019re looking at today are able to do so much more! We have sinks and showers that can fit all of your everyday needs. A traditional bath with just the right level of height for tall or short users can also offer plenty of comfort, as can the addition of a ladder up to the shower for those with limited mobility. There are even models that can make it easier for older or disabled people to find their way up and down, or even to just sit there and relax! These modern ideas in bathrooms have a lot to offer, and could be just what you\u2019re looking for.","token_len":527,"entropy":[12.7865,0.3755,7.6217,2.0366,8.2478,6.3172,9.2046,12.1095,3.9614,0.4144,11.0125,1.7456,2.6208,3.4968,4.5555,7.878,2.6085,1.8303,3.9283,0.1425,1.0034,4.524,1.6251,0.1511,0.2828,1.8671,3.6082,3.3077,10.589,3.1779,0.2408,7.3274,5.0032,0.6898,1.1515,2.5884,0.7231,2.6803,4.5364,3.7652,1.866,0.4067,1.7061,4.0601,4.361,2.2432,3.7241,0.7582,4.1854,7.3277,4.722,3.2199,3.8188,2.6535,4.6875,3.678,19.7891,5.8207,12.6019,2.93,1.0671,8.3505,0.0236,0.0396,4.2863,6.9514,0.9417,2.0348,1.4028,4.228,3.1627,0.1347,0.0073,0.3934,0.0005,5.7782,3.4794,0.7233,1.7403,4.3168,0.4334,1.6421,1.4122,11.4082,6.1805,4.8342,5.1811,0.1261,10.6581,6.9416,6.4674,0.1095,0.3947,2.0019,1.1962,5.8321,0.2209,4.3046,6.9033,0.2882,4.3124,1.7917,0.6754,3.3761,0.3235,7.4964,6.0666,0.0021,1.4687,3.5293,8.6897,1.7816,5.0797,5.7301,1.0252,1.7973,13.9965,0.6924,2.3137,3.4448,1.0945,0.1399,11.2947,1.0326,2.0626,4.9528,4.6901,4.8085,1.6587,1.2634,5.9212,1.0551,0.3219,5.9948,0.4299,3.0093,1.8311,5.0976,0.0492,5.9587,7.3649,2.4861,16.9535,6.5079,8.2939,8.3593,2.7626,2.7978,9.1162,1.9374,1.6828,2.5446,2.2525,0.0746,0.0082,2.1128,7.1049,1.2163,4.7418,0.8543,3.4431,5.0573,3.1562,3.1428,6.3364,7.5659,3.5457,5.532,5.1064,1.8076,6.7506,0.4394,0.963,0.902,1.9804,2.8563,0.3965,2.5226,1.7634,4.3598,2.6499,2.1835,3.5127,3.2798,0.511,4.4219,0.4771,1.9861,0.076,4.4963,2.8174,3.6377,0.4179,0.5467,2.1932,4.6602,6.2491,8.3302,0.3756,1.124,1.1814,4.4375,4.1874,1.0422,0.382,10.0278,0.0402,1.5798,6.0038,6.5733,5.5418,3.1611,2.4367,12.1757,2.3754,0.3599,9.6987,2.1839,0.725,0.4968,2.1203,0.5963,4.6098,0.0278,3.4025,2.3699,5.3841,3.6014,6.5525,5.6788,1.3363,3.4681,5.3012,4.0665,1.0339,6.8501,2.6677,1.0391,1.488,0.5767,2.4249,0.1329,1.8935,1.8593,2.1126,6.8698,2.3858,4.6999,0.0808,1.9512,6.6461,2.2769,0.5663,4.5578,5.4506,4.5808,1.6631,6.7536,3.9766,0.0897,1.8877,7.1438,2.0994,4.3419,4.3276,4.5772,1.1002,3.8885,0.3896,1.9603,2.7215,1.7498,3.0977,7.3269,0.3377,0.8223,4.6572,2.0768,4.2313,4.7,5.159,0.021,0.0022,2.9724,3.8502,1.1672,0.1471,2.8478,0.7637,4.1942,1.0309,4.7865,0.8237,0.0081,4.173,2.1677,1.5102,0.9748,2.7634,2.4212,5.0775,2.0964,1.654,1.4418,2.6669,5.6753,2.1844,0.2444,5.3538,4.2395,2.0444,5.5069,3.5242,1.8004,2.0847,0.7856,6.2405,0.2081,0.0326,5.1854,0.173,0.1645,0.0795,2.2992,0.5677,4.7942,2.2838,4.2677,3.5533,1.7403,6.0927,2.6257,1.1898,4.9411,2.1318,1.1689,3.1146,1.9239,4.5337,6.3978,0.2008,0.8097,2.999,5.7922,3.4147,3.5894,0.4579,5.5035,2.7026,3.2126,2.8248,2.9156,3.0813,2.0139,0.0464,5.602,0.467,1.9706,3.1373,4.6743,4.6604,2.692,2.1304,0.1654,1.1315,3.7194,6.6363,0.5757,4.3497,5.3297,1.6769,3.8521,6.0268,8.6159,0.0,2.213,2.2966,1.8438,4.0633,7.6624,0.0035,0.2092,0.5239,2.4032,7.1637,2.6315,3.3761,0.1648,0.018,1.8317,2.9236,5.3841,3.6767,3.3195,0.7381,2.0588,1.9758,5.7335,0.401,0.2535,0.9285,0.276,3.0954,7.8399,1.1605,1.3037,0.1368,3.9245,4.1402,0.9239,1.4219,0.7298,6.4675,0.007,1.8298,3.6425,0.9918,0.1964,2.7304,2.6613,2.4637,15.2572,2.651,2.2815,0.8267,2.0862,4.5681,3.0043,1.3855,0.9237,5.045,0.5331,1.676,4.4746,5.1227,1.9014,3.7628,4.8662,2.4349,0.7821,4.3677,0.0292,5.6199,3.3888,9.0375,4.1834,1.3579,7.1631,2.313,3.382,4.0343,5.2125,0.0157,3.2686,2.3761,3.2554,2.6828,2.5692,4.5911,0.0063,0.8537,9.3086,6.4374,1.4322,0.9649,2.3928,4.0132,2.6091,2.4571,3.4098,2.1078,0.2858,4.2361,0.451,2.3409,5.9027,0.8122,1.2184,4.45,2.8136,3.0837,1.2942,5.9048,3.4369,2.0919,1.3435,0.1118,4.6448,2.2003,1.3394,3.3612,2.5763,0.5145,3.9808,2.4896,1.3074,2.8968,4.3903,2.4332,4.1782,1.1654,1.176,3.4396,3.9351,2.3622,3.1065,6.1823,3.6299,3.2471,2.8849,1.3679,2.1371,0.0805,1.6771,0.8442,6.0596,1.5879,3.9042,1.0499,0.2947,3.3489,0.1369,1.5512,0.0537,0.0366,0.8107]}

During the war, the bank's traditional business fell off and the bank closed its Berlin office. Through 1945, Deutsche Bank AG (previously a subsidiary of UBS AG, since the merger of Deutsche Bank in 1929 by Adolf Hitler and the formation of the Deutsche Bank AG) managed foreign savings accounts, under agreements with UBS, the State Bank of Russia, the Central Bank of the USSR, the British Bank of England (Banque d'Angleterre) and a number of other countries.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s London, Paris and Lausanne offices were destroyed, as were UBS\u2019s Frankfurt, Brussels and Warsaw offices. After the World Bank was created in Bretton Woods, UBS provided the British authorities with advice on the formation of the Bank and the establishment of capital reserves.\nThe Bank of England's Treasury Division was established in 1933 by UBS, to advise the central bank on the management of global financial transactions and exchange rates. At the height of the war, there were 150 Londoners and French workers at the Bank, all with access to confidential information. Many of those people were captured by the authorities, and the Bank was given over to the British administration.\nAfter the war, UBS did not take part in the reconstruction of the German Economy and refused to cooperate with the new German government. During the war, it had built an important branch office in Berlin, where the headquarters of UBS AG is located. During World War II, UBS did not participate in the reconstruction of the German economy. The Nazi regime accused UBS of keeping secret foreign gold owned by Jews. After the war, the company continued to refuse to cooperate with the new German government.\nThe relationship with the Soviet government began in 1931, when UBS received special privileges when it began to work with them as a financial intermediary. It provided the Soviet authorities with information on international financial transactions and currency. UBS also created a system of counterfeiting coins and printed money in Geneva.\nAfter the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, UBS maintained its relationship with the USSR and continued to be involved in the financial market in a \" grey business \u00bb, providing information and the formation of capital reserves for the Soviets. During the height of Soviet rule, UBS managed the entire capital reserve system maintained by the state for the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s, UBS was again invited to open a branch office in the USSR, where it was given tax holidays.","token_len":527,"entropy":[2.6156,5.2338,0.0074,5.6626,0.2818,0.5027,0.1232,4.9734,8.4379,2.8048,2.8165,5.7652,0.0073,1.4916,5.2288,6.5461,0.0254,2.4168,4.0843,3.2342,10.8622,0.1753,1.6141,4.638,1.0023,1.1085,0.2409,1.5678,2.7081,2.3937,8.618,3.8964,6.0581,4.0761,2.8391,1.8554,1.7984,3.7577,1.2279,7.5854,0.8738,0.9673,7.5033,7.1509,0.2805,5.6094,0.2163,7.2382,3.4821,8.3584,0.1211,4.8698,1.11,0.0341,2.2181,0.042,1.8825,2.4388,6.0248,2.544,2.6123,1.2535,2.4694,0.2466,2.775,4.0858,6.7089,8.3504,0.5756,3.0653,1.5717,7.7056,0.007,1.3604,1.6702,0.2596,2.3049,2.4006,5.1421,7.5354,6.5547,0.8959,2.1382,6.3266,7.1824,0.6864,3.3416,0.1036,2.2744,3.0251,4.9232,1.2662,0.1521,4.4702,0.7869,1.5644,2.9699,0.0429,0.0639,1.5788,1.4767,0.4887,1.3071,5.7703,1.911,0.4719,0.5694,3.2905,8.2305,3.0911,5.7933,0.0088,6.6647,3.4971,6.4205,0.2341,2.2766,0.0728,3.5399,0.7677,0.0046,0.9402,4.1255,0.271,1.4247,12.5382,0.0002,0.1078,14.6391,7.7482,5.0655,7.372,5.1745,5.6204,0.8608,8.3096,0.26,0.0015,0.9498,0.8574,5.4378,2.5114,3.0324,0.9176,3.1999,0.0216,8.6442,0.1058,0.0772,3.1114,1.068,4.0825,0.5654,4.8313,0.3312,0.4437,4.8813,0.9,5.1935,6.7048,2.0062,3.295,0.7239,15.0688,0.0001,0.0008,1.5314,2.1697,0.0093,5.482,2.5581,5.8349,4.9405,0.1426,7.0924,1.0467,1.9806,5.8651,0.116,1.3971,2.0049,2.3619,1.7151,4.3575,0.0083,7.0322,5.3043,0.7634,1.7681,2.2281,1.7928,3.0859,0.6092,3.1146,7.7552,4.1775,1.539,1.8965,0.5137,4.2121,3.204,3.8748,0.0534,2.1248,4.3858,3.9555,0.7653,3.1836,0.3918,0.7445,1.1325,3.992,0.1346,6.4725,1.2408,4.2083,2.0064,6.315,0.6486,0.2771,4.2375,0.653,3.8346,0.0043,0.2882,3.5951,0.2745,4.998,0.1746,6.5557,6.3306,7.6995,2.8102,7.9215,3.8983,3.0782,1.1066,0.6205,1.5768,5.0017,3.8963,5.1043,0.0287,7.0566,1.4044,1.0226,5.4114,0.5964,2.4219,4.4467,1.0787,5.0326,1.6104,0.7175,6.5302,1.6941,1.7659,2.2464,1.1546,1.3471,4.3116,3.877,0.1526,0.6631,2.1229,6.5759,0.9572,1.0958,3.9587,0.5912,0.5859,0.2159,1.0831,0.0062,5.3221,0.7588,3.956,2.223,0.0131,1.155,5.1144,0.3684,0.6336,3.7327,5.6935,2.8713,7.3152,0.1792,4.5424,0.2419,0.5587,5.8649,1.9735,0.677,1.0272,3.878,0.5427,1.5667,0.1898,2.4204,4.0522,7.3247,3.5203,4.1368,4.4312,3.3282,0.4766,1.2369,1.1085,2.6605,2.7141,6.046,0.4904,1.6584,0.0052,3.7288,5.3174,0.2009,0.2503,3.4825,1.6034,0.0024,0.0181,0.1124,0.8447,0.0054,3.7304,0.2484,1.6432,0.0799,0.5373,0.9962,0.0842,0.4811,0.2072,0.6568,1.2126,2.9867,6.721,1.6049,6.8651,0.698,0.001,0.2165,6.0566,3.1241,5.0973,8.0477,9.6506,0.2414,5.2799,2.0297,3.8167,0.5727,0.4329,0.0559,1.7669,4.8859,4.5023,0.4069,6.5926,0.3164,1.3147,0.081,0.4387,2.7895,0.6226,0.104,0.7185,0.6179,2.0865,7.2368,3.0554,0.8439,4.0599,3.9801,2.9048,0.9991,5.9949,1.0984,0.2654,1.0458,0.0059,3.5311,6.4566,4.7361,5.6136,1.0449,4.911,1.3867,3.2361,0.903,5.6397,3.7632,0.836,3.661,2.2039,0.7788,3.5552,3.3301,2.258,1.8915,3.1364,0.1373,1.7624,0.9296,3.2783,1.6194,0.529,1.3488,4.6183,2.9764,2.5791,0.0107,2.3347,6.6611,1.0128,5.191,0.6266,9.8577,0.022,6.4991,1.9017,6.5845,0.9679,2.5067,7.2706,1.203,1.5368,3.3261,0.5613,7.4761,4.4737,0.0722,0.0137,0.6397,0.8148,0.1332,0.5799,0.8435,0.0077,5.8432,1.591,2.8927,0.0208,0.1516,4.1154,2.1502,3.4821,0.3506,4.5084,1.8988,0.4215,1.124,3.7303,4.5711,2.5782,4.3451,6.2117,16.0995,2.7525,11.5816,3.0415,4.6241,2.2568,2.2489,5.4126,7.7444,0.059,3.5263,0.5992,2.277,0.6781,5.9909,0.5156,2.7858,0.6056,5.2692,0.0019,5.6748,2.8315,0.3504,0.5585,0.0059,6.0823,2.1253,6.3689,5.8758,1.6858,0.8864,9.4888,0.1454,0.2608,4.916,4.9158,0.5648,1.1817,0.2889,0.8061,2.5056,2.1163,1.9101,2.3048,0.0901,0.0454,0.9213,0.0074,2.0074,4.6667,5.189,0.2718,6.3985,1.0582,0.8105,0.36,0.1572,2.5802,3.8818,1.3124,2.5309,0.7529,1.9406,3.4127,8.3574,5.7328,1.2401]}

The outer moons are small, while the innermost four have diameters ranging from around 550 kilometres to over 15,000 kilometres.\nIo had more than 10,000 craters; a small fraction of its 1,450 kilometres diameter has tholeiitic rocks. The moon's atmosphere and its moonlet Enceladus is believed to support small volcanic plumes that are periodically bursting into the atmosphere, and a massive ocean under its surface.\nEuropa is the second largest moon in the solar system, with a radius of roughly 4,500 kilometres. It is covered with rocky, dark plumes, suggesting an ocean underneath. It also has an atmosphere, including methane, water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.\nThe surface of Ganymede appears bright and wet at ground level. At sea level, the surface is covered in fine glacial ice. Dione has two large maria with thin bright zones separating them. A large equatorial dark band of a type not seen in any other moons suggests an ocean under the surface. Uranus's largest moon (which has no name and was designated by the International Astronomical Union), has no surface depressions and shows a dark cloud of material in the equatorial region.\nScientists are also studying Pluto's moon Charon, found to be an unusually dark object. Pluto's high albedo in infrared images also points to a thin ocean of water-like material under the surface. Charon is a crescent moon of Pluto with a diameter of about 100 kilometres. It is much less opaque in white light than normal moons. Astronomers also hypothesize that, similar to the Earth, Pluto should be covered in an ocean of frozen material. When charon orbits the planet, its close proximity to the planet keeps it cooler, giving its ocean a more stable structure, which would be important to explain Pluto's moon-like appearance in visible images. The New Horizons probe should probe many more moons in the system by December of this year, so there will remain a lot to learn about the system in its entirety.","token_len":527,"entropy":[6.5893,6.0793,2.8367,2.5307,9.1638,0.052,0.1159,0.4338,0.651,5.753,1.6189,4.7627,2.8052,2.7189,12.2703,6.4825,3.2153,3.7252,4.0322,0.2594,2.9418,5.5453,5.5653,5.3593,3.8908,2.4085,1.2505,7.2949,4.8976,0.0,4.4203,5.5623,0.1648,4.7183,9.329,0.737,0.9323,0.001,10.4602,0.694,15.4456,1.4331,0.1536,3.5834,1.8743,2.9088,1.2036,5.0998,3.8522,0.5001,3.56,6.5549,2.7463,1.2621,13.17,0.3935,3.3918,4.6577,4.8451,0.5936,3.6902,3.3813,0.5242,0.2417,0.732,3.068,0.0011,0.0,0.0005,0.9649,5.3829,3.961,1.1225,5.5716,0.0021,0.5566,0.6534,1.9478,8.6771,3.6825,1.1088,3.3091,0.0004,1.586,1.7953,4.7499,1.4206,4.547,0.0155,0.9819,2.5795,2.7526,0.0155,1.5306,3.9822,6.1068,1.5423,1.8622,3.0421,5.9103,3.6549,0.2878,0.1528,1.0426,4.987,1.2404,0.7374,2.094,3.2171,2.6674,1.2659,5.6867,1.0705,6.2935,0.1274,1.2453,3.6593,7.1597,2.9851,5.6399,0.0101,3.1784,0.0828,4.9378,7.5658,3.8123,0.7865,2.7292,5.2701,0.5469,0.0649,0.1793,0.5129,0.736,7.5064,0.106,6.1283,5.3569,0.7276,3.5499,1.0381,0.0765,7.1238,0.0003,5.5731,5.3259,3.6472,2.8882,0.2062,2.85,6.5067,0.5249,5.677,3.1205,2.6701,3.903,9.3132,9.2731,7.4588,2.5096,3.8577,1.2321,1.5943,3.8063,2.468,3.4817,4.0596,3.2613,3.9615,9.4091,9.7883,0.0434,0.0001,0.0,5.2425,1.6391,0.0068,5.1097,6.3594,4.2439,5.8707,0.0174,1.9363,2.6674,6.872,7.1999,1.6445,1.9185,0.4717,2.633,2.7577,4.1255,4.1984,4.2151,6.6033,1.6089,1.3236,1.2413,0.8476,4.6005,0.004,1.8905,1.7728,3.5137,1.4979,0.7151,1.241,0.3547,0.6526,0.0023,0.9364,1.9313,0.9629,3.0828,0.1443,5.0165,3.1605,0.4225,1.7749,0.4398,0.4773,2.0692,1.0891,5.713,1.6965,4.7535,2.5245,5.6298,4.6429,0.0667,1.9362,5.9095,3.9435,1.6892,4.3996,1.2289,3.1255,3.4217,0.499,2.8474,2.1824,2.4569,5.3143,2.6864,1.2184,3.6987,1.1151,3.3913,0.2385,0.3724,1.1452,3.5011,0.4123,0.8559,1.6569,3.8297,0.5635,6.2827,0.0001,0.0006,0.0035,4.7771,4.189,1.6014,4.7939,4.8508,7.1591,0.1276,1.3637,4.5267,5.0348,0.0466,0.2298,1.3588,1.7368,0.8503,2.1231,1.4807,5.1369,5.9697,0.531,2.0711,1.6721,5.8891,0.0478,2.5021,5.1253,2.7355,9.1268,3.8509,6.6859,5.3525,7.2952,6.575,6.3065,0.5329,0.6595,3.959,2.3589,8.3099,0.0619,8.2959,4.8101,3.1892,5.471,6.5653,6.9097,1.0026,1.276,3.1565,0.3241,3.4073,5.6463,3.2767,1.1598,3.4066,0.9736,0.67,0.2746,4.304,0.0013,4.1769,3.3423,0.2441,5.2497,4.2801,2.0825,3.5741,5.8721,2.8683,4.0395,3.4849,2.5045,0.9646,2.2785,0.5938,0.0022,0.0012,5.1374,4.2855,3.0685,4.4918,7.4899,0.0785,1.9715,6.9281,2.4715,4.2573,4.3028,1.6429,5.4748,3.5196,0.8242,4.5378,0.1149,2.328,0.3575,0.6579,5.2844,2.387,3.2703,2.7046,4.6724,0.5062,2.1065,1.3973,0.0027,0.898,6.7721,1.8153,0.9559,4.4384,5.3261,4.1481,3.1692,1.469,4.1635,1.0883,6.6008,6.3314,0.0168,0.0012,5.0533,4.9491,5.3245,5.0734,5.1222,0.1397,1.1358,5.509,5.2375,2.9507,2.6061,5.7114,1.9789,1.28,3.2772,0.9825,0.4331,0.3843,2.9702,0.003,1.1099,2.851,7.8478,0.171,0.4613,2.7689,4.4426,2.0828,0.6828,1.1968,0.2103,1.8619,4.3976,0.4103,0.7037,2.1942,0.8399,5.7996,3.4417,7.9032,3.1768,6.3757,1.9484,0.8963,8.1385,2.5539,1.3974,7.6433,0.0384,4.749,6.6584,0.1474,0.2832,5.8486,4.6116,0.0229,1.8254,5.2756,0.5229,1.432,6.415,1.2578,2.5881,0.7904,3.7867,1.6934,0.7994,5.5125,3.4971,0.9347,6.4878,9.2729,0.179,3.6961,1.2423,2.2261,0.3963,1.6364,7.8558,1.2231,0.1527,0.781,2.4706,7.0785,0.5637,3.4892,2.1826,3.2464,3.7536,5.7298,1.1379,2.7203,5.1898,5.9878,3.5126,2.5457,3.1168,3.2456,3.7955,2.1856,5.3694,3.7438,0.0251,4.744,2.2376,0.3799,1.563,3.4816,5.388,4.3781,0.1816,3.337,6.0,0.0097,1.0666,4.8869,6.726,6.1726,1.4273,1.8295,1.9216,0.6599,3.9603,3.4874,5.4883,4.2288,1.119,0.0081,1.4758,4.0341,3.607,2.2477,6.1994,1.5596,1.8033,2.9874,1.2165,0.242,1.3438,3.5337,3.7347,2.1029,3.6611,0.1757]}

Two of the Conduits escape. Delsin pulls Reggie inside the truck as the Conduits shoot each other. Reggie is shot in the leg. He crawls to the back of the truck. He is transported by Marine scouts, accompanied by some of the injured inmates and a prisoner with a gun. Their group encounters another group of Conduits, who are led by a former prisoner. A member of Marine scouts shoots down the prisoner, killing a few of the Conduits. Reggie helps the injured. The Conduits flee when they are discovered. The Marine finds the Conduit with the gun, but he also finds out Reggie is alive. Reggie gets his wounded friend to safety. The Conduits are ordered to retreat. Reggie and the injured marine follow. While they are fighting other Conduits, they find a truck with food. They steal the truck and escape. The wounded marine is given a gun in order to hold off the remaining Conduits. Reggie and his group, including the wounded marine, eventually escape, driving up to the highway. In the woods, Reggie is captured and taken prisoner. However, the other prisoners find him, so Reggie is taken to his fellow prisoners. The three men talk about how good it would be if they could get Reggie to the United States. However, two other prisoners come into the cell and threaten to kill Reggie. Reggie is released, and the other prisoners escape. Reggie now only has two days left on his prison sentence. They must get out of the reservation. Reggie tells them the other group is already on the road, and he has to get them there on time. Reggie finally meets John with the other prisoners. The three men set out with the prisoner, taking the prisoner's truck. Back in Washington, Reggie is interviewed by a detective. Reggie says the man shot at him was from Akomish. John tells Reggie that the gunman was just an old friend. Reggie is given the chance to confess. John asks for Reggie's help since he was so close to his friend. Reggie refuses.

With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Discovering Blake to be working with a group of superheros to investigate the crimes, he becomes involved with the team. Blake has a girlfriend named Barbara and the two get married despite Rorschach knowing they are in love.\nIn October 1985, the police are investigating the murders of several teenage girls. They call in the help of the group called the Enchantresses to help them. These girls are not human, but are sentient vampires and they kill humans to feed on their blood. Enchantresses find a human who works for a scientist who is hiding from the police, and they take him for protection. They get to know the rest of the Enchantresses and one of the girls falls in love with them.\nThe Enchantress series was created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez, and written by Mike W. Barr and Neal Adams. The Enchantresses was a spin-off of the comic book Batman and was considered by several to be in continuity with the other titles of the Batman storyline. Some have speculated that the Enchantress stories predated Rorschach and were written as part of an earlier continuity.\nThe Enchantress comics and stories have been considered \" science-fiction crime comics \" due to their dark tone and many of them following themes such as vampires, demons, extraterrestrials and other non-human antagonists. Another reason for this is the use of advanced technology and scientific phenomena in the story.\nThe title Enchantress was used to avoid any possible legal charges made against Marv Wolfman based on an earlier comic books series called Star Trek : the Genesis of Khan. The legal dispute arose when the original Star Trek series was being reissued, and was published without getting permission from the original owner of the rights. Marv had intended to do a Star Trek comic book, but instead began writing the Enchantress books instead. When he began work on Star Trek, he decided that the whole thing would have to be a parody.\nRorschach was created in a similar way in Batman : The Dark Knight Returns, when the character of Shade was changed to be a masked vigilante of his own design. The change of Shade to Rorschach was not intentional, and was the result of a confusion when a mask in Superman's series was accidentally made with the name \"Rorschach \". Later in the series, Marv realized that it was possible to make Rorschach out of a mask.","token_len":528,"entropy":[8.1794,6.8751,0.2064,6.2928,0.4763,1.472,1.5627,6.928,1.0239,1.4721,2.7322,0.0636,6.7068,6.7704,2.4193,6.686,1.272,5.1931,4.823,3.3093,3.1137,0.9057,14.0911,1.941,2.8946,6.3429,5.0124,0.0469,0.0,7.5943,0.0683,8.4563,4.4466,0.9735,7.8777,0.0623,4.0343,5.7978,0.1003,6.4767,2.4377,1.6846,3.1192,0.2077,5.0577,5.1245,0.1036,4.5923,5.002,1.0514,4.8526,1.2939,1.4801,4.6941,1.7352,1.0196,1.3194,5.0997,1.878,4.1411,3.3902,2.0014,4.5649,1.3851,5.347,2.8072,3.7753,0.9616,4.4397,2.1589,7.5107,4.5582,0.0042,0.0019,0.0008,5.0463,2.6229,0.9705,3.5583,0.9823,0.267,2.108,10.1063,3.3854,1.0047,0.0939,2.9971,3.2062,1.6243,0.2115,0.1715,4.2028,0.0195,6.8251,5.9696,0.7041,0.9994,3.0912,6.6955,1.3297,1.3597,1.6571,0.0588,2.1773,4.5583,3.7823,1.1624,9.7373,2.6748,1.6445,2.0948,1.0177,2.2827,5.847,1.4681,1.0428,4.7711,5.295,1.2782,0.5547,2.0567,7.0248,7.8084,2.6605,2.9304,4.1816,4.436,2.2178,3.5972,1.9125,0.9831,1.414,0.2953,9.225,1.7836,4.8206,2.8037,4.8265,3.529,5.5809,0.9724,2.2253,7.722,2.261,1.9116,5.7821,3.1053,1.1488,1.8891,2.4458,1.5569,2.3614,3.7876,0.7721,4.3032,5.951,0.34,2.7864,4.6874,2.7283,0.9091,1.475,5.0056,0.029,0.1888,3.7184,0.5588,1.1638,5.8574,0.393,1.4167,1.8452,5.146,0.7145,0.0674,0.0532,2.7824,0.4087,1.7406,2.4355,2.5841,0.8579,8.3797,2.6767,2.383,0.2984,6.2604,3.1095,0.6205,1.184,1.2131,5.5757,4.2126,1.8686,1.4986,4.5092,0.1048,5.2167,5.0878,1.6444,5.0237,1.6521,6.6938,2.051,0.2883,1.6414,6.8343,2.3739,4.0706,3.2996,3.6151,0.969,0.0037,0.8311,0.7517,4.5479,1.678,5.4663,1.6455,5.0885,7.7481,2.1454,4.7667,3.0241,0.1448,5.7335,3.7593,0.1148,0.4903,3.3831,4.3384,1.7438,0.1972,2.932,6.4149,0.3381,6.2854,4.3941,1.737,0.1732,0.8143,3.4674,0.2842,4.6879,7.5139,1.3137,6.4622,0.0053,0.0016,0.0006,3.5477,3.1473,2.159,3.2446,1.8945,0.0032,2.6784,4.1398,4.4657,2.0796,0.9756,1.9704,3.0329,0.0895,3.5441,4.0318,3.9629,2.5217,0.8648,5.1139,5.0234,12.3558,2.8614,0.0284,9.4268,3.7006,0.8796,5.6865,0.1089,1.3413,5.5475,2.4945,0.7719,5.4705,1.8093,2.3909,8.4668,4.8813,2.694,0.0025,2.9089,0.7013,4.5034,0.3174,6.4013,0.2978,0.002,0.0,1.4539,3.0875,4.7022,0.1636,0.6818,9.454,0.2658,6.9594,3.3127,1.1769,1.4166,0.5528,1.7269,3.9154,0.0243,8.2082,0.4118,2.0328,6.1757,7.1182,2.7449,0.7323,2.9447,0.6149,1.0935,1.5578,5.5248,6.5632,0.0318,2.0528,4.4601,2.1931,6.1232,3.3299,3.6487,3.8082,5.7656,6.5517,0.3324,5.7239,0.0251,0.0472,0.0024,5.8883,0.1099,4.8414,2.3505,2.5289,6.228,2.2947,2.5831,6.6669,3.6763,4.6872,5.9196,7.9582,1.7073,11.7378,1.1103,1.6941,7.7441,6.1044,3.7158,1.911,1.5336,3.7217,1.7783,0.0246,2.2968,1.2081,3.3389,4.0686,1.7704,2.8225,1.0013,3.5044,6.3446,4.5539,8.1776,4.479,0.1982,0.7199,2.735,5.1538,1.3559,0.1542,3.643,0.5709,4.2611,0.0029,4.4434,5.9875,0.2869,4.4703,1.9206,3.2601,0.0133,2.2835,2.1829,2.6541,0.5023,3.5816,5.8476,2.6122,2.1474,5.3039,0.0379,4.6025,3.8042,0.4329,4.8881,3.5132,3.5261,3.4346,0.0407,1.4732,0.0082,2.3828,0.8538,2.9603,1.7296,1.3535,5.812,2.2505,1.5184,3.0039,0.1655,0.4746,2.6281,3.5985,2.2389,1.6734,5.4463,0.0336,0.002,0.0006,2.3152,5.8879,3.0667,3.753,2.2593,1.1144,4.8518,4.2393,3.7781,1.1555,1.4421,0.0087,0.4976,2.4441,3.6821,1.8967,3.4272,2.1785,9.7749,1.8757,6.5972,0.7551,2.8297,0.7598,7.0719,1.0271,4.7173,5.2642,0.2364,2.6613,0.4617,1.8555,4.3541,4.2805,2.097,2.0093,6.6751,0.0159,0.0032,0.0013,1.1353,2.9314,4.2038,0.6795,2.4661,1.5434,4.1513,0.2433,0.0152,1.5993,6.2829,4.761,4.0704,7.8154,4.5695,6.5319,1.7634,7.398,0.8942,6.3428,2.8872,4.5837,1.2454,2.9926,1.7184,1.1139,0.2448,0.0044,0.0039,5.3127,5.8447,1.8222,0.7391,0.8507,0.2941,6.1555,0.0085,4.7972,0.2849,3.0077,0.286,4.6806,0.5433,2.1452,3.1623,0.0139,0.0025,0.0011,4.7869,1.0279,1.3606,3.2797,2.2812]}

There may be faculty at another school that handles the specific operation of student government operations, although the faculty is typically limited to administrative matters.\nThe primary purpose of the office is to advocate for the student government and other student groups at UNC-Chapel Hill.\nIn May 2004, the Carolina Union, with support from Student Government Association, launched the Student Government Advisory Committee, serving as the formal liaison between student government and the university administration.\nThe office works to improve student government and student life within and beyond the University, and seeks to foster awareness and communication between student government and the University administration.\nThe office has staff to support the Office of the President in promoting student government, including planning the Student Government Association's annual meetings and events and the organization of campus tours.\nThe office maintains a large display in the Chapel Hill Mall to give students a tour of Student Government Center. The display does not include the full scope of events that take place at Student Government Center due to space constraints. It is, however, a great location for the administration for a small tour to visit the many facilities available to student associations.\nThe office also produces a newspaper called The Student Government News, which was published by the student newspaper staff through the previous academic year.\nThe Carolina Union administration is aware that many students find it difficult to work on campus on the same schedule that the university is working. The majority of students would like to work during the office hours. In order to meet that request, some students use the offices in the Carolina Union and other student organizations to have their student organizations set up during the day.\nIn terms of physical structures, the Carolina Union building was designed not to allow it to completely replace the original Union. In the end, the Carolina Union has become a multifunctional building which serves as the administrative headquarter of the universities.","token_len":529,"entropy":[9.2324,4.8771,5.0176,6.5094,4.7655,0.0007,1.7354,7.3272,3.8229,3.8175,7.0628,0.7652,7.1678,1.8957,0.5562,5.9793,5.4229,2.5676,3.2398,6.8375,3.8212,0.3829,0.3014,2.948,0.8667,8.3797,2.0333,5.352,0.2556,1.1733,4.096,2.1977,7.7807,9.3142,3.9244,1.4479,2.2853,4.1824,3.1814,3.8486,2.5457,3.2125,5.1352,0.5825,5.8797,1.5021,1.0554,14.293,0.4109,5.1084,2.3454,0.0523,3.4395,1.89,0.4251,3.8684,0.9809,1.6128,2.0471,3.8395,0.1461,5.9867,4.1801,3.858,0.4486,2.6125,3.8176,6.7347,1.6313,0.1389,1.8558,8.728,0.713,6.3063,1.4909,1.3154,0.8789,1.8274,3.3264,1.5728,3.2465,1.2526,0.2241,0.0001,0.4979,1.3253,4.0165,1.8297,1.1644,4.5121,1.5751,0.0151,3.11,4.8803,2.4421,0.0214,1.2786,3.1059,2.5006,5.4368,2.4278,5.4483,3.0797,0.0506,1.0673,4.1757,0.185,2.2976,0.7694,0.9747,2.9575,3.4078,0.1958,7.0495,0.8802,2.2597,5.1207,2.8293,2.9333,0.0956,4.8363,6.3719,2.2913,1.8552,3.7321,3.6834,6.6125,1.8734,2.4018,3.0369,1.8804,4.9682,3.039,0.2467,0.2408,0.7764,5.7434,3.0233,4.3358,0.1522,0.9793,3.1787,1.6995,1.4515,3.5502,1.6709,5.5066,5.8524,1.0097,3.2847,1.0049,3.5602,3.7971,0.1463,3.6476,3.2605,3.1893,6.872,0.1983,3.8616,3.7597,5.7137,2.7616,2.4699,7.4574,1.7335,6.878,7.9867,0.1448,1.5085,0.257,6.5298,1.4955,5.2313,2.091,3.6386,2.4229,4.2383,5.8438,0.223,3.8906,4.6629,0.6292,0.9297,2.1038,6.2315,1.8858,0.0625,1.1558,7.2379,0.9712,0.1076,5.7433,0.2531,1.3784,2.2911,0.2615,2.4248,4.2609,1.0208,1.4761,3.0541,0.7005,3.9018,0.7119,0.0014,0.0006,0.0001,0.4389,1.9146,3.7319,4.7651,4.7493,0.1782,0.9506,3.7311,0.0942,4.0242,3.4679,1.7099,0.079,5.0403,0.1629,0.1385,0.5061,3.634,1.2017,1.2589,0.2963,4.8454,1.0914,1.9723,7.7121,0.4922,1.12,5.882,3.6636,0.6546,2.0062,0.2565,0.3942,0.89,2.3343,2.2283,0.2681,1.501,1.3693,6.1353,5.1775,1.2534,3.5183,0.9077,0.9277,1.8793,1.9677,4.686,4.5333,2.9024,2.8899,0.5523,3.7752,3.2252,1.6429,4.9313,0.1561,3.0995,5.8469,1.2231,4.7501,1.8554,1.6737,0.4361,0.35,0.7681,3.0564,3.4802,0.5159,0.7921,1.4351,2.3782,2.3537,5.7853,4.0957,3.4726,1.8165,4.5531,0.4615,2.3031,1.6882,3.2084,4.6489,1.1072,0.3214,1.8722,3.3027,6.0099,3.3843,4.3577,0.2115,3.7025,1.0489,2.7544,3.6427,1.3304,4.2028,3.224,2.3864,5.2376,4.3855,3.6509,5.5235,0.7989,0.575,1.1583,1.3788,4.5859,1.0425,4.8032,7.8253,4.4377,0.7469,2.6588,0.0017,5.4906,2.6441,5.0339,0.6337,0.9434,5.5384,0.1795,5.3393,0.0329,4.3554,0.8186,1.8895,2.5387,6.5336,0.0772,1.1522,1.5854,4.9337,4.7257,0.0196,6.3798,2.3283,3.101,0.0007,1.0959,2.3413,0.0101,0.429,7.5119,0.0041,4.5108,1.0225,0.4955,4.4677,1.0168,5.9726,0.1588,0.0013,2.1131,1.5914,5.3134,0.4022,2.5104,3.5581,5.1122,3.173,4.8473,5.689,3.3196,5.6467,1.5752,6.1988,3.3415,4.1359,2.2138,2.732,7.0964,0.8618,0.4015,1.268,1.1813,1.4729,6.4893,1.5845,6.6482,3.296,2.0195,1.7309,0.219,3.0755,1.6744,0.7289,4.0347,1.7879,1.7222,0.7669,2.4806,2.6083,5.9136,5.6475,1.0221,6.6315,3.6632,0.0448,0.2846,0.9925,1.1249,4.3574,0.0162,7.2443,1.6719,5.2463,1.6549,2.592,1.0564,3.688,1.274,0.502,0.1285,3.7428,2.7856,1.1213,4.5649,2.766,2.3633,4.2084,3.1048,2.5757,2.5443,2.5065,4.5176,2.4275,1.8697,5.3402,0.1214,1.2289,5.2111,1.9267,0.2033,0.8432,4.7333,0.637,6.547,1.9063,1.6849,3.5268,2.0712,0.0989,2.6259,3.6253,4.1764,0.0709,5.2814,1.7835,3.3828,1.277,3.979,3.3345,1.3852,8.6412,0.4021,3.6974,2.1541,1.1379,0.9674,1.9649,5.1054,2.0121,5.9144,2.8213,5.9524,0.1425,4.1199,0.7414,2.4334,0.8564,0.712,2.8459,6.3267,0.0008,7.0265,7.316,0.4579,0.8411,1.4608,0.0249,4.7894,2.8424,1.7793,6.6888,1.6039,4.7007,5.7028,0.0471,6.4372,5.6489,0.6014,4.3682,6.1335,4.0737,3.1013,2.2618,3.2484,0.0718,0.6711,2.8624,0.0294,2.6022,4.9343,1.109,8.1944,0.8674,0.0213,1.285,3.7629,3.6636,0.5715,1.7356,3.6064,8.322,1.9119,1.7019,0.5645,7.5149,0.6867]}
{"prompt":"In 1987 , the Swedish group Veni Domine started playing progressive and symphonic doom metal and released its first album Fall Babylon Fall in 1992 , ranked as the 38th most influential Christian metal album","text":"In 1987, the Swedish group Veni Domine started playing progressive and symphonic doom metal and released its first album Fall Babylon Fall in 1992, ranked as the 38th most influential Christian metal album by the Rock Christian Music Hall of Fame. [78][79] In 1993, the album The Vision in the Darkness reached the top ten in the German rock chart,[78] and in 2007 another album, The New Light of the World, placed No. 19. [80] Some of the other bands like Sumerian Moon have been based on this style, some of whom also incorporated elements of psychedelic and metalcore, as well as elements of neoclassical and symphonic metal.[81]\n[33] At one point he wrote a piece on what he saw as misogynistic themes in the Black Sabbath song \"Death Metal Woman,\" and the subsequent band's response. The Black Sabbath song was included on his album The Dark is the Highway. In an interview with Kerrang!, he said, \"Just to be very clear, I mean there was no misogynistic meaning to the song, which was an expression of love and admiration for a female singer.\" He later added, \"The lyrics in the song did not make it misogynistic. They conveyed love and admiration.\" [34] On the May 13, 2018, edition of his podcast, Metal God, Paul Stanley stated that he disagreed with the band members' views on the song and that the lyrics \"could have made it misogynistic. I don't think so, it's really romantic and loving.\" He suggested that fans read the lyrics instead of taking everything Stanley said literally.[34][34]\nAn example of the progressive tradition in metal is the band Dream Theater. The band was often described as pioneering the heavy metal genre in the early 1980s. When the band first came together in 1980, it included James laValle (drums), Peter Kember (guitar), and Michael Romeo (keyboard),[82] along with bassist John Petrucci and vocalist James LaBrie.[83][84] Soon after their formation, they released the album DREAMS AND FIRE. This album was considered to be an important step in the early history of progressive metal.

Warren was released by the Broncos the week before the draft and re-signed with them on August 14, 1990. Warren was released by the Broncos again after his contract was cut on December 10, 1990. On August 15, 1991, Warren returned to the Broncos, where he remained through the week 11 bye. He was then released by the Broncos and signed with the New York Jets on August 22, 1991.\nAfter retiring, Warren worked as a sideline reporter for the Broncos and broadcasts for WCBS in Denver.

Through the video a number of street performers join the party while others are photographed. Some of these activities are in full view of camera and others are not at all. Once again it is important to clarify that there is no indication on his video he was in charge of or even seen him do what he was accused of. I find it odd that Guetta who is not a street performer would allow this to happen. When a group of people do something stupid, it is important to call it out and hopefully it does not happen again.\nI hope with the next video he can clearly explain to the street performers what they are and who are the people to deal with when they do things that are not appropriate.\nA few days ago I posted about the issue of two girls being caught on camera in their bathrooms. The fact that the girls were wearing bikinis or topless only made of their situation even more concerning. Since posting on my blog there was another video released by The Star. I am still unsure what it is about this video that is so upsetting and concerning to so many people.\nIt is not just that the video is of girls and even though some are wearing cloth, others are not, but there is no denying that one of the girls is of a more adult age than the other two girls and that the third girl is more than a few years younger. The first thing that comes to mind in relation to the video is that it is not that clear whether or not all 3 are fully clothed or not. But even if it is totally clear, they are still in a very private and personal space and a man should be respected. And yet we all know that there is a difference between respect and being sexually aroused. I have heard people say they do it for the respect and others say they do it just for the excitement and or for the money as well.\nAnother factor that has received more attention is the fact that the two girls in the bathroom were filmed alone. It is not just that they were not completely seen, but that they did not interact or even greet the men. I have seen some photos of the video where two men appear to be talking but in no way do the girls appear to be aware of them. Also in the video is the fact that while one man is standing in a particular position the other man is still standing up or even walking in between them. Some have suggested that the young girls should have told their father or others that they were being filmed.","token_len":530,"entropy":[7.3441,8.2022,0.1645,9.8949,2.3295,7.5141,2.8095,0.8922,3.236,0.4086,7.119,2.8571,4.1504,9.8206,5.5152,8.7676,2.0787,9.1646,5.4312,1.568,7.9122,4.4393,4.4153,0.6844,4.1184,0.5818,8.2415,0.9599,2.0616,4.4666,3.7918,0.0052,5.2274,1.7618,5.244,1.9662,4.6868,5.156,3.8036,2.6047,5.8859,2.3908,4.8922,0.9027,1.8803,7.1464,1.2352,4.575,4.6456,1.4357,0.6993,5.0317,2.17,2.7791,0.4963,2.5795,4.757,0.0267,1.0578,7.0367,3.0474,3.34,0.6218,2.1314,0.1884,6.7746,1.1595,3.0921,0.8599,0.6457,5.4393,4.1695,5.2652,2.435,6.216,1.3214,2.8962,6.5647,0.1835,5.2692,3.2111,5.7241,7.6176,5.1972,4.8185,0.2941,1.5037,4.0284,0.0682,0.8785,4.7357,4.6607,0.6823,3.4641,0.2716,2.3201,0.0021,6.3816,1.4847,2.9173,2.2747,4.9569,0.2459,1.6798,4.7427,2.4764,1.5677,1.1728,0.9475,5.2078,3.3717,4.1418,0.2286,1.2911,4.1892,1.9369,5.5415,1.5351,1.6033,0.8587,4.2145,0.486,5.2593,2.429,0.2423,1.6738,6.1133,2.4734,2.7664,0.174,1.3987,0.1351,0.1759,1.0103,5.5657,3.2006,7.4548,1.9267,6.217,2.1534,4.3936,3.1428,6.4492,2.5831,2.4397,1.7233,4.3633,0.2267,1.6248,2.572,1.0038,4.8451,4.6623,3.6489,3.4982,2.1681,5.2468,9.0378,0.0038,2.8179,1.146,1.4188,2.5458,2.4357,1.218,1.497,4.3484,1.8928,1.47,4.6837,1.9184,2.7072,1.0631,0.9054,3.1328,2.4268,1.7085,5.674,0.2703,7.8296,4.4826,2.0913,4.3029,1.8131,0.5404,2.8728,3.411,5.4801,1.384,2.2791,5.6756,0.3534,1.998,2.2737,0.9832,3.3802,6.6755,0.0645,0.0003,4.0301,6.5094,0.5198,5.7855,2.6123,9.015,4.1917,12.5517,4.7481,0.3316,4.5967,0.5247,4.7841,7.4875,3.0425,2.5946,1.3946,3.3828,4.0641,4.7797,2.6829,4.3902,2.1893,4.9558,6.1746,3.7727,2.5444,2.674,3.5685,3.8291,1.8751,3.3115,0.7374,1.0213,1.2302,0.6611,0.8878,2.0352,2.0923,2.449,2.351,5.7059,1.7594,4.2327,0.0045,0.9763,0.3978,2.2265,3.5507,0.8556,2.7056,2.5471,2.0846,1.8241,2.1284,1.2181,4.5319,3.6488,3.5697,6.4517,2.5976,3.2841,2.8388,1.7496,9.2172,2.3965,3.4017,0.4661,1.7622,2.1466,3.4314,3.7301,0.5809,1.4216,5.2307,0.5347,5.0829,0.9718,0.4929,0.7005,1.328,6.3121,1.1604,5.0233,5.188,2.0089,1.135,0.7762,1.0032,3.0662,3.4456,2.7946,1.6727,2.0789,5.8497,0.6757,0.6341,3.4947,3.8511,2.4081,3.4503,0.2525,0.8155,1.7016,2.2917,5.2467,5.013,1.2807,2.9279,0.0267,0.128,4.516,5.7441,0.0048,1.6512,1.5585,0.1828,0.9997,1.7431,1.0112,2.4786,4.0649,5.6393,3.4312,1.5141,0.0023,5.2174,6.165,2.7313,5.9555,1.0295,1.9796,0.8464,0.2823,4.6848,3.5669,1.2739,2.23,0.7148,7.2506,0.2714,1.3055,4.8447,1.1182,1.3564,3.4015,2.1608,2.8292,4.6454,2.9123,4.8418,2.3255,1.9388,4.9431,5.1021,3.3093,1.9911,7.0593,1.7771,4.5213,4.2311,3.9573,2.6074,1.214,0.6393,2.8347,0.7105,1.5156,2.6914,0.2976,8.2248,0.5525,2.7179,4.7182,3.9831,0.7693,2.8843,2.7075,3.3107,3.0532,0.8873,3.9628,2.9577,4.273,2.0349,1.5167,6.2177,2.1137,5.9265,0.9319,0.7969,0.2915,0.0155,4.5069,1.0407,0.4351,5.4082,2.0928,7.4563,2.3788,0.8798,4.3379,5.1685,1.3075,0.2582,1.8404,4.0677,5.8449,0.8643,3.2557,6.9569,2.0528,0.2653,0.8467,1.199,0.9616,0.0302,1.4305,4.0473,0.4119,2.8569,0.2045,6.3429,1.7898,5.2453,5.7334,0.8609,2.9456,0.6785,1.6516,2.4212,0.6257,1.0148,0.8171,2.7239,5.0733,8.4085,1.9058,0.832,0.9258,1.032,3.0313,0.1321,5.3352,3.9904,1.6403,7.0812,2.0924,3.0843,1.588,2.8092,1.7853,1.6055,2.8777,3.9767,0.4478,1.6706,5.2789,2.087,3.7494,1.8395,4.9207,0.62,0.5116,3.5251,4.3393,3.0782,4.6055,0.1173,2.1605,2.8576,2.7644,3.29,0.1231,0.5723,5.179,0.3724,3.2976,0.5549,4.8032,3.2463,0.8911,0.9978,4.5885,1.835,1.009,0.0481,4.9772,2.285,3.0278,0.953,3.5259,1.6928,2.7781,6.679,1.6026,4.7101,0.2968,1.3803,0.5963,2.7956,1.6249,6.2844,5.1031,3.8181,3.1313,2.2618,6.1299,1.1519,0.295,5.1296,3.2118,3.0243,0.2141,1.4954,5.5794,1.6595,3.6795,1.9656,6.1609,2.6417,3.0807,2.1183,4.8094,2.0509,0.7202,0.9306,2.8611,1.0377,1.2367]}

Even the NAACP president, James Bevel, had a different perspective on the issue. \u201cI think Mr. Du Bois would have made a fine judge,\u201d Bevel said in his book, The Trial of Henry Louis Gates.\nThis, of course, is Du Bois\u2019s view of the matter. In his 1951 memoir The Negro in America, Du Bois takes a different view, though Du Bois would argue that Bevel\u2019s views reflected his racial prejudices (more on this later). For Du Bois, the PIC trial not only \u201cserved as a powerful rallying point in the black liberation struggle,\u201d but his trial \u201cserved a special purpose for our people \u2013 and I think to him it certainly was so.\u201d For Du Bois, the trial was about the plight of all marginalized people in America\u2019s society \u2013 people of color, the poor, the dispossessed \u2013 people whom, when they are treated in a racist fashion (including when poor people are treated in a racist manner), they end up losing all sense of identity: \u201cWe end up being nothing but an abstraction.\u201d\nDu Bois says that he wasn\u2019t upset at the racialized language in some of the letters or articles that Du Bois published. Du Bois did not want them read as being racist. But Du Bois was upset that there was such an anti-black and white racism in America in 1950 (though Du Bois would be even more insistent about this in his 1962 book, After Reconstruction: The Transformation of American Politics ).\nDu Bois writes, \u201cApart from the fact that it seemed to me that any appeal to racial superiority, even as the basis of an appeal, is bad policy for those black people, it made me wonder whether anything could be more dangerous than this kind of thing.\u201d For Du Bois, there was a danger that his black identity could be conflated with white supremacy and racism.

The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a Zeppelin NT , at a recorded average speed of 62","text":"Fossett set the Absolute World Speed Record for airships on October 27, 2004. The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a Zeppelin NT, at a recorded average speed of 62 mps with a top speed of 73 mps. The previous flight, on April 20, had a speed record of 57 mps with a top speed of 65 mps. The new record was also held for a long flight distance of 1,600\u00a0mi (2,900\u00a0km). Airships, however, are typically only useful for short-distance flights. In late 2008 The Flying Dutchman II reached an altitude of almost 27,000 feet (8,200\u00a0m); only three airships have ever reached this altitude. On May 31, 2007, the fastest airship took the record for the longest flight time at 19 miles (29\u00a0km) which was won by the Dutchman II. The previous record held by Zeppelin II was 13 miles (20\u00a0km).\n\nPilotless airships\n\nThere are experimental projects being conducted to develop airships that can operate by themselves, without a pilot. A project for a pilotless prototype was carried out by the Airships International Corporation of South San Francisco. This involved six airships of the Zeppelin III class, in which each airship could carry a load of five tonnes and could lift 20 tonnes. They were connected to each other by air-to-air cables. The purpose of these cables was to allow for the aircraft to be able to fly autonomously as long as these cables were intact. The airships were controlled from the ground via a satellite-controlled computer. In the final round of testing in the summer of 2003, some of the Zeppelin III's cables were cut. The Airships International personnel were also not able to contact the Airships International computer to tell them what they needed to do.\nIn 2011 the British Airships Association announced the release of the world's first fully autonomous airship, the Dronia. The Dronia is a hybrid aircraft design using the technology and design of a large plane. A high-winged wing is attached to the upper section of the fuselage to increase the overall drag and stability. A small stabilizer was fitted to allow the airship to control its attitude during flight. The Dronia can carry around 150kg of cargo.\nIn February 2012 a large pilotless airship was made to fly autonomously by the company The Hangar, which is based at the Farnborough Airshow.

The Temple Methodist congregation lost","text":"By November 1936, enough debt had accumulated that a bondholder's protective committee foreclosed on the property, buying it back for $ 750 @, @ 000. The Temple Methodist congregation lost all its capital investments in the land and building. On July 6, 1940, the land was sold to a group of private interests for $ 250, 000. On September 2, 1940, the congregation was granted temporary use of the building until the property could be rehabilitated and renovated. After the war, in 1946 the building was converted into a school preparatory school by the state. It remained in that condition until 1965, when the city purchased it for redevelopment. At that time a new church was built on the property.\nThe second church was designed and constructed by W. H. Smith in 1915. It consisted of a two-nave building, which was to be roofed with gabled gable ends and a clerestory with an interior dome. The exterior had an ornate stone chimney and steeple, and a tower, at the upper part of a two-story bell tower. An exterior porch ran around the building from one end to another.\nIn 1925, the congregation became aware of the need to remodel the exterior and make some structural changes to the second church, for the building was deteriorating. In 1926 a three-story addition was constructed on the west side behind the first story and a two-story addition was built on the east side, which separated the interior of the choir from the nave. Also, the main gable of the nave was reinforced by a bracing system that had a vertical brace with a diagonal connecting brace.\nThe restoration work was made possible through an offer of the congregation, which bought the structure and all its furnishings from the city in 1965, but retained its original name St. John's Methodist Church, and its membership.\nIn 1966 the congregation took possession of this building and purchased an old garage and other buildings to turn them into space for worship.\nThe third building, built in 1935 by James F. Cates, was a two-story brick building, with a steeple, a stone chimney, and a gabled bell tower, with an exterior porch running along the east side. It was to have a cross-like front with a portico to the portico.\nWhen the congregation bought the third church in 1969, for the sole purpose of remodeling it into worship space, an interior porch was built on the south side at the cost of just $10,000. It was of red brick and stone with a simple portico and a stone railing.","token_len":533,"entropy":[8.9175,9.2616,0.2687,10.8802,9.1485,1.0693,1.4492,2.8346,3.4784,5.7687,3.7963,3.5453,11.8704,6.0505,8.2437,0.6265,0.2958,0.894,3.9933,2.2585,6.4684,1.6111,3.21,1.71,1.0952,12.8308,11.7313,6.9125,5.9944,9.4912,2.2486,1.8671,10.5203,11.8249,4.9405,4.5689,3.6801,1.4819,5.0785,6.4261,1.9609,1.3293,4.9586,1.7927,8.2036,2.1627,4.3293,3.4598,3.6346,0.3709,4.3234,0.1137,1.0632,5.1701,0.7823,0.4191,0.8302,2.0434,3.1628,0.1852,3.2003,5.3407,1.7315,0.1993,4.3512,1.3037,6.6635,0.8826,3.2238,1.8639,3.0526,0.0834,0.7838,0.077,0.7642,5.0898,1.9678,4.5413,5.9261,4.1027,0.4967,0.4627,3.4203,4.6931,1.4573,3.7694,2.9411,0.0479,4.9534,0.0013,1.9339,5.0074,0.4846,4.3055,1.388,5.0393,0.2268,4.6494,3.1508,2.4674,1.9943,0.5634,3.3957,0.6063,0.4794,4.0337,10.4189,0.0001,0.9581,4.8488,0.9043,5.3756,1.2034,2.9987,3.548,1.6844,5.0753,3.6545,0.252,4.7403,1.2998,0.1125,1.0559,4.2687,3.1098,0.9941,0.5829,6.336,0.6576,4.3821,1.0042,0.0926,4.9273,3.4732,3.7903,0.6292,0.7002,1.7288,0.348,2.7166,1.3575,2.0803,6.6678,5.5856,3.3947,1.0714,5.5918,2.9484,1.6086,1.0354,5.1241,0.5017,3.2643,0.0669,4.6547,2.4926,5.4482,0.6298,1.6162,3.9724,0.0334,1.5353,3.8359,0.5185,9.8649,5.5988,3.3236,1.8484,3.8455,1.0352,3.8522,0.627,8.7917,0.059,3.0861,6.2767,2.6166,5.3351,2.283,6.3647,1.8071,2.0105,8.7988,3.5286,0.0647,4.5728,3.1533,5.2045,5.703,0.9221,0.8741,2.9244,4.747,3.1404,3.9945,0.2763,4.4315,5.4044,0.039,1.589,8.1695,1.6744,1.9203,1.6315,1.7262,6.316,3.1633,4.3299,0.5442,4.389,4.2743,0.2289,4.9991,4.6977,0.1112,0.8926,7.6078,0.2377,1.6472,4.9466,3.0593,4.6906,7.0829,4.5925,0.2342,2.0436,3.6434,4.0582,0.6014,0.5533,2.7381,0.9871,2.4637,2.8707,4.2317,0.5064,0.9408,5.1025,4.3387,5.415,0.3964,0.778,3.6095,1.2831,3.8514,0.0006,0.4026,4.2503,3.1179,5.7843,5.1497,3.697,0.6146,1.9127,1.1116,5.7445,0.2853,2.1885,5.1345,1.5267,3.3758,1.5847,5.2676,1.0467,2.1826,2.8448,3.6883,5.4874,0.0265,0.3201,6.7788,0.5266,1.7044,1.9233,0.2486,4.7374,0.4048,8.0627,0.1277,3.024,6.3879,2.2366,2.2085,2.3226,0.0117,0.0234,1.6411,1.299,1.7665,0.7861,0.0746,0.569,0.2755,3.0445,2.8451,5.6527,0.2402,5.3635,1.6474,0.0467,7.5596,0.4751,0.0832,9.6903,0.0077,0.7034,6.1354,1.9963,1.8246,5.1545,6.2425,0.5026,3.1934,0.1356,5.3487,0.0033,0.6235,5.3778,2.6901,1.2655,6.9719,1.1901,4.386,2.7194,3.3758,2.4044,4.4016,5.5474,3.7612,0.9338,5.7971,6.5737,2.2396,1.4244,1.8162,1.2129,6.9739,2.8663,1.5275,4.7739,3.0078,3.2837,3.7206,5.0517,1.6899,2.8598,5.3991,4.8557,1.5116,5.1165,0.558,4.7845,2.3715,5.1958,1.6997,3.7783,0.0008,1.8439,0.7331,1.6564,2.6635,4.8381,2.0532,3.3987,5.9719,2.3384,1.7217,4.8533,9.135,0.2215,2.3243,0.8712,6.6422,0.3215,1.7074,2.3665,3.0162,5.5668,3.731,1.5637,2.1656,3.7638,1.3645,1.8849,5.3865,2.6461,0.0155,5.3114,0.9485,1.1801,4.2405,4.3002,3.8761,6.5309,2.6953,4.5911,2.7772,2.9732,6.222,5.6798,0.0451,6.8164,0.4731,5.0117,0.9333,1.8967,1.3465,3.6701,2.5183,1.6544,3.0204,0.3994,4.6567,2.3592,4.9421,4.147,0.22,5.1454,5.2258,0.7631,0.4804,3.7362,3.1829,0.0597,0.0618,2.6125,1.0321,2.1285,1.3951,0.8319,5.6958,0.0097,1.7747,2.1688,5.5307,0.7949,0.0031,0.5236,0.7765,0.6852,2.9144,0.7221,5.8716,0.1749,2.2449,1.9519,2.0464,1.5193,1.2046,3.5767,3.3287,0.3481,2.2613,0.5793,1.1709,2.0993,0.7664,3.3543,2.0268,1.2263,7.0893,0.7047,7.78,4.6537,3.2195,0.7718,8.5074,0.7367,3.9994,1.8154,8.4634,0.0372,1.4405,1.7048,5.3079,0.58,2.2374,3.5248,0.4802,3.15,1.8674,0.7189,3.3476,0.2542,6.0818,3.0253,6.7557,0.221,0.016,4.3761,0.0294,1.8319,2.9944,5.5854,1.2606,0.234,5.0099,3.7632,1.7377,0.4483,1.9598,1.5584,0.3646,2.2761,0.418,5.3518,0.3816,5.2931,0.0015,6.5243,0.6557,5.2892,0.2669,0.1222,0.3211,2.6075,0.6292,6.7158,7.8005,0.8198,1.3892,5.1508,1.866,0.8986,6.0445,6.8278,0.0466,2.1623,1.2637,4.4017,4.6557,0.9868]}

The following morning, it was downdrafting, and it finally exited the gulf during the afternoon.. 2\nFigure 8 : Houle radius of the surface wave (a) for the storm at 0700 GMT on September 4 and (b) for the same storm at 1100 GMT on September 5. This is a plot generated by the NCAR Wave Model. In both plots, the black line represents the storm track, and the gray area is the area of heavy rainfall (> 30 mm per 24 hours) from the NHC. 2.1 Introduction\n8\nAfter the Gulf of Mexico, a landfalling cyclone developed over the western United States. The storm entered the Midwest region at 1200 UTC on September 6 with strong winds, heavy rainfall and blowing snow. The tornado, which caused at least 16 fatalities and resulted in the evacuation of 50 000 people, originated close to the Missouri Missouri River valley just northeast of Elkhorn, where strong winds were estimated to have been at about 40\u201345 miles per hour.. 3\nFigure 9 : Map of wind speed (gales) from the NHC based on surface observations. The gray shading indicates the area for which wind speed exceeded 40 miles per hour. White area indicates the area where wind speed exceeded 40 miles per hour. 2.1.1.2\nThe Indian Ocean storm\nOn September 30, 2006, a strong tropical cyclone developed off East Africa. Using sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and other meteorological observations, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted that the system would intensify by Saturday. The NHC then upgraded the cyclone to a Category 2 hurricane on September 28 and reported that it has reached maximum sustained wind speeds of 100 miles per hour.. 4\nFigure 10 : The track of Hurricane Emily over the Indian Ocean is shown in Figure 10a.

After pitching to a 6 @. @ 75 ERA in 50 2 \/ 3 innings for the Tigers, Humber was selected by the Washington Nationals in the second round of the 2015 MLB draft.\nOn September 8, 2015, Humber took the final two games of a six-game start to the Toronto Blue Jays with a 0 @. 00 ERA and 4 K in 7 inning. Games 3 and 4 ended with the Blue Jays on a run of four wins. His last start, a September 28 game against the Cleveland Indians, was 2 @. 00. In six innings, Humber gave up two runs on two hits with an earned run, and walked one player and struck out six. On October 27, Humber took the final game of a five-game start to the Houston Astros with a 2 @. 00 ERA and 0 K in two inning. Humber, however, was pulled after throwing his seventh full toss of the season.\nThroughout the rest of 2015, Humber struggled to maintain consistent quality. He made at least one start, but never gave up a perfect game in eight tries. He won only three games in 14 starts (18 5 \/ 21 innings) and was placed on the 10-day disabled list on April 2. He did throw a complete game on April 4 to prevent the eventual 9 in victory over the Florida Marlins.\nIn 2016, Humber was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. The next month, he signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. From June 27 to July 13, Humber pitched for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. In a July 14 game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Humber was charged with an unearned run that resulted in a 6 @. 00 ERA.

Two Japanese troopships were shot down and sunk that morning, both by BAC Landing Craft. The Battle of Balabong Beach lasted 2 and a half hours, and it was the largest Australian naval engagement of the war. The British had an initial success, and in addition to avoiding heavy casualties, several Japanese ships were taken.\nThat successful operation was followed by the battle of Bunker Hill on 20 January 1943. A squadron of Japanese bombers raided the Australian naval base at Rottnest Island on the day of her departure from Australia on 12 February 1943. Fort Fort Henry at Rottnest was hit severely by the Japanese naval bombardment.\nFort Douglas at the other site of naval operations in Australia was more fortunate, and there the war ended. Douglas was bombed by the Japanese with only one casualty.\nThe Rottnest raid was the last of the small Australian naval aircraft squadrons in 1943. Over that year and the next Australia lost 10 aircraft; nine from Rottnest, one from Balabong.\nBy 14 December, Australia had suffered only three casualties in the three major naval engagements of the war. The BAC Landing Craft lost three men killed in action and 15 wounded. BAC 2\/102 Heavy Gun boat was badly damaged, one gunner killed and three wounded, she was subsequently torpedoed by enemy craft and sunk on 21 December 1942.\n\nAfter the end of the war\n\nThe BAC Heavy Gun Boats and the Royal Australian Navy arrived in the Pacific Ocean on 1 January 1958.\nFrom 15 to 17 January 1946 a group of the BAC Landing Craft and some members of the staff sailed to the Middle East as part of Commonwealth Forces in the region.

{"prompt":"The Ely Spur was planned to run from a new interchange on the Ely Link Road to the Ely Bridge Roundabout on the A48 . It was only 1 @ . @ 2 km (","text":"The Ely Spur was planned to run from a new interchange on the Ely Link Road to the Ely Bridge Roundabout on the A48. It was only 1 @. @ 2 km (0. 1 @. @ 0. 5 mile), and was scheduled to be constructed in four stages; the first stage would connect the new interchange to the old Tollgate, the second stage would connect the new interchange and Tollgate Road, the third stage would connect Tollgate Road to the Ely Bridge Roundabout, and the fourth stage would connect the Roundabout to the A48.\nConstruction began in April 2004, and was scheduled to be completed in three stages. However, the construction difficulties caused by the flood in May 2004, forced abandonment of stages 2-4 (the existing stage of the Ely Spur was re-routed for the third and final stage of construction, to avoid work being carried out in floodwater). The current, first version of the Ely Spur runs from the Old Tollgate to the Ely Bridge roundabout.\nThe scheme was funded by Network Rail for \u00a36.5 million. As part of a wider review of all trunk network tolls, Network Rail commissioned a study into the operation of the Ely Spur in February 2005. The study concluded that the current level of tolls (although reduced from those originally planned in the second set of traffic surveys) were appropriate given that the construction period would be significantly longer than expected, traffic would also increase, and the road access between the Roundabout and the bridge would now be provided by a dual carriageway over the A48 (rather than the earlier plan for a bridge across the road).\nThe initial \u00a315 million cost of the first stage of the Ely Spur was reduced to \u00a310.7 million when Network Rail also reduced the proposed tolls; in January 2013, Network Rail stated that the cost of the first Ely Spur stage would only cost \u00a34.3 million to construct.\nIn April 2015, Network Rail decided to make the bridge crossing the A48 free of toll charge, as a result of a report on \"Improving network access to Ely\" written by a technical group consisting of members from Network Rail, Local Transport Authority Ely and contractors to construct the Ely Spur. The group was appointed by Network Rail in September 2014 to investigate ways to improve traffic flow along the Ely A48 corridor.

In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first-team football. After a spell at Rotherham United, Goater moved back to the Premier League in late 1990, when he signed for Preston North End. He was a key player in the club as they won promotion to the First Division in 1991 and later made the run to the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup Winners Cup Final, where they lost 4\u20131 to Ajax. After Preston North End and Goater struggled to maintain their First Division position, he moved to Liverpool in 1992 for \u00a3500,000.\nGoater would play in midfield or as a left winger but he was an outstanding goalkeeper of his time. In 1993 Goater set up goalkeeper Jimmy Butland for Liverpool when Butland left for Tottenham Hotspur after spending the next five years playing for Bolton Wanderers. Goater's first start at Liverpool came on 29 August 1993, in a 2\u20131 victory over Wimbledon that finished in the Champions League Quarter Final. After another year with the club, he signed a new contract in January 1994, as Liverpool fought back from defeat in the 1992-93 UEFA Cup to win the Premier League and his playing career came to an end. He retired from football in November 1994.\nAs a footballer, Goater was never on his team's first teams but had a successful youth career playing in the youth teams of both of his clubs. He had a season in 1985\u201386 while playing for Rotherham United A, where he won the FA Youth Cup winner's medal.\nIn June 1985, he scored the goal against Scotland in the 1984 European Championship qualifier that had the British public convinced that he was an international goalkeeper. In September 1985, he scored the winner for England U21 against Denmark in the 1985 UEFA Euro U-21 Championships. He also made his debut for Scotland when he was 15 years old against Poland in a 3\u20130 defeat. When he played for England in May 1986, at the 1986 World Cup, he made his international debut against Portugal in the 1986 World Cup Third Place Match. He also had a spell at the Manchester United B team with them in 1981. He won a testimonial in the 1982 FA Cup Final against Everton which featured a parade through Oldham's streets.\nIn 1994 he published his autobiography called Fifteen and the Football World. His second and current autobiography is published in 2007.

{"prompt":"Since Islais Creek is a culvert that carries storm water , domestic sewage , and industrial wastewater , it is possible for the sewage to overflow . Such overflow can cause a public health hazard","text":"Since Islais Creek is a culvert that carries storm water, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater, it is possible for the sewage to overflow. Such overflow can cause a public health hazard.\nIn addition, the lack of proper water quality at Islais Creek has led to an algae bloom, which has contributed to increasing turbidity.\nAn algae bloom can increase the quantity of suspended sediment in the water, which in turn can lead to a larger amount of sedimentation in Islais Creek. The sedimentation, in turn, can reduce the sunlight that reaches the water, which can lead to an increased risk for public health.\nAs a result, Islais Creek has been degraded. The water quality in Islais Creek has not met the standards of Florida\u2019s Water Act, and therefore it is no longer suitable for use.\nAustin Cutter, a Florida State University undergraduate student, conducted research in Islais Creek for his senior design project. This is Cutter\u2019s first research project and he hopes to continue his study to better understand the impact of Islais Creek and the area of Clearwater.\nHis study included the development of an electronic water quality monitoring system to measure the water quality parameters in Islais Creek.\n\u201c I have had the opportunity to study the relationship between aquatic life and water quality. As part of my senior design project, I was tasked with developing an electronic water quality monitoring system for Islais Creek. My project entails using a microcontroller to collect data from Islais Creek over a period of 3 months. The data is then written into a memory card, which is read by a desktop computer. I can then analyze the data and determine the average data obtained over my 3-month monitoring period. \u201d\nCutter will continue to conduct the water quality monitoring using the monitoring equipment until he receives his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Environmental Science. He hopes the electronic water quality monitoring system will be able to help raise awareness about Islais Creek and increase the quality of life in the surrounding community.\nIn 2013, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) began work on an Environmental Monitoring Program ( EMP ) in Clearwater. The EMP would provide local government with a comprehensive dataset of environmental characteristics and the environmental condition in Clearwater.\nThe EMP began by collecting water quality data from the Clearwater River and Islais Creek using a portable monitoring system. As a part of the EMP, an undergraduate of Miami Dade College would work within a laboratory set up by NOAA to determine the quality of water in Clearwater. Such information would be shared with the municipalities.","token_len":536,"entropy":[9.0381,3.6533,6.0455,9.6328,2.3205,2.0342,7.9285,2.277,1.9857,5.4478,8.2343,1.2925,3.0354,10.2964,2.9334,0.9264,0.82,4.7141,2.0868,3.0594,3.5159,1.436,5.4372,2.6063,1.725,5.5419,0.559,3.8482,2.3019,6.3585,1.8034,1.9662,1.2433,2.718,6.1952,0.5162,1.5558,1.3063,0.9945,13.8742,2.8001,0.5854,1.6382,6.0991,0.0037,4.0679,4.0149,2.802,6.4172,0.5848,0.0006,0.0007,0.0427,2.713,1.6868,0.1594,3.1333,6.1254,0.1892,2.0519,0.9818,2.0143,4.2696,0.0231,5.93,8.1938,0.0413,1.955,1.1788,5.3684,1.4791,0.0195,1.7651,4.3552,0.6589,6.7422,0.1541,8.4074,2.9167,1.1989,0.5978,1.8157,1.4238,1.2402,2.9274,0.0145,0.9095,2.1674,0.0071,1.9396,4.7317,2.0185,0.0112,2.3735,5.1996,2.2436,7.0028,0.0017,0.0012,0.0207,0.3397,2.7088,3.7019,1.8912,4.6681,2.5327,0.054,0.0363,0.8794,4.6003,0.4667,9.2586,1.5742,4.426,0.2332,2.8768,1.992,1.1785,1.2055,1.7356,0.0044,3.1222,0.958,1.4942,2.1451,7.816,0.0145,1.0398,0.2813,3.8582,1.2147,0.1164,0.3655,2.5603,0.0017,0.0009,0.024,1.8657,1.5102,8.151,2.0934,2.0724,2.8592,1.5346,2.2848,1.0229,0.0019,0.0006,0.0058,0.7698,3.7312,6.2748,0.8175,2.1048,1.8859,7.1965,14.1645,7.8467,5.742,4.8839,8.3768,1.7508,2.1572,4.9856,2.9195,0.634,3.385,0.0394,2.4546,0.0927,2.4539,2.353,0.6558,10.3342,11.3829,0.7699,1.8342,4.135,1.9869,0.1071,6.3276,2.6759,0.8695,5.1565,2.3318,2.5847,1.7562,0.0023,0.0011,0.0106,3.2565,3.6385,7.6126,8.3278,1.0067,0.6964,3.9111,3.4914,11.6076,9.9484,0.2897,0.1247,0.849,2.0934,0.4189,3.6563,1.7806,3.3399,0.5444,1.6489,1.8847,3.7745,3.0619,2.1996,0.0418,0.4314,3.1018,0.2518,1.7412,0.003,0.0016,0.0027,3.0564,1.6764,6.1852,3.8744,7.4948,0.3313,1.3744,0.5002,5.0509,3.676,3.7376,3.0712,4.1729,0.0861,2.474,6.0481,2.9815,1.7962,1.2533,0.1278,2.4414,2.4251,0.875,1.6907,0.1786,7.8872,2.193,0.759,0.0045,0.0013,0.0031,0.5726,1.8822,6.9304,5.8254,7.79,3.0452,4.9619,1.5995,0.5349,0.0329,3.0429,1.1708,6.2297,0.0622,7.7176,2.1471,0.4466,2.5676,0.0601,2.7363,3.371,3.439,0.0013,0.6054,6.2704,0.6914,0.4605,0.2722,0.168,2.5955,2.6309,0.1572,2.1161,1.5649,1.064,0.7466,0.0213,0.0745,0.0382,2.3052,0.7456,0.0025,0.0019,0.0052,0.4766,3.6985,3.2138,8.5222,2.8917,1.3323,5.4747,3.8777,0.8936,4.1749,1.726,0.9772,4.3356,0.0083,0.0019,0.0268,4.8703,0.8598,1.4153,0.0026,3.9497,1.7661,0.5527,1.6873,2.2614,1.4318,1.2979,7.091,1.9187,0.6191,5.9646,1.3342,1.9406,0.9502,0.6215,4.3435,1.7313,1.0727,8.4812,0.7235,1.1703,2.9424,4.7648,0.9046,3.45,0.4426,0.3952,1.3105,3.0427,1.1197,5.206,6.4864,8.4223,3.0849,5.1185,1.384,1.0408,0.0466,4.3928,0.3384,0.2352,7.0168,3.9003,1.1038,6.159,0.4072,4.8026,2.0949,0.762,2.7355,4.5678,5.9235,0.1462,0.3594,5.1927,1.4814,5.7444,3.9999,5.8001,1.3097,2.9626,2.4651,5.9544,8.2529,0.1894,0.1513,2.9028,0.5014,1.4379,0.6728,2.0361,2.5456,2.9669,3.8164,3.5366,1.6446,0.0902,0.0346,0.144,0.3872,1.351,2.3806,0.0039,2.3375,7.7442,1.0309,1.1911,1.3028,0.002,0.0012,0.0022,0.8247,4.6072,1.3479,3.1035,0.0588,2.2819,1.1827,0.7407,4.4939,3.1382,0.1251,0.3817,3.3512,4.9507,0.1606,2.1904,3.929,1.6378,0.0071,0.005,0.0,0.0035,1.3398,13.3204,0.284,3.7894,4.9139,0.5833,2.2101,4.2543,2.8009,2.2101,1.4976,8.8613,0.9588,3.4595,5.7036,0.0007,1.2533,1.2501,0.9942,4.7786,2.432,5.2404,3.6911,1.3323,2.0713,3.4905,5.8758,0.5525,3.3559,5.5565,1.4624,3.6701,3.852,5.8154,3.3507,2.767,0.0004,0.7985,1.3964,1.7865,0.9909,5.645,4.0632,1.3454,3.245,1.9269,0.4255,0.6423,1.6044,2.9727,0.0054,2.5297,2.005,5.2299,0.0056,0.0016,0.0596,5.6587,1.3198,4.3921,3.4213,0.7017,0.964,4.4024,1.7462,3.241,0.0004,0.6348,2.7687,0.3814,4.3275,7.7764,6.2646,5.7004,6.5852,0.0178,1.0721,5.0569,3.7399,5.9787,2.0873,4.298,5.6358,0.1516,2.6413,3.2183,0.8384,5.4943,0.5794,3.7448,0.1374,1.3047,0.8323,0.9442,0.0004,0.4418,7.0475,4.1382,0.4759,0.4025,4.0858,0.4893,1.0757,9.5632,3.9034]}

The opening scene is a mess and it does nothing to excite about the whole series. And the writers just can\u2019t seem to come up with any stories of any relevance as to what\u2019s going on in New York in the 1960s. It\u2019s a pretty bad start to a fresh new season of the series, and I don\u2019t see that any of the problems will be addressed by the writers or the production staff any time soon. I am done with them, especially after the show does the same thing with the endings of both Season 5 and Season 6, which is to say that they end without answering any original questions that they started with ten years ago. We know that every season of the show must have at least one good episode and that there hasn\u2019t been many of those the last two seasons. There is nothing I want to re-watch from past seasons, I don\u2019t want anything to happen to my character in the show, and I don\u2019t want anything to be revealed about any of the characters. And when you have to have everything so crammed into one episode, you\u2019re going to have to find out everything that you want to right at the beginning, and then your entire last two minutes have to just hang out with the main characters. If a season has got to be a few episodes long, why not let the writers take their time to put the characters through their paces and provide more than enough plot points to go around.\n\u201cAs for The Powers Of Three, I\u2019m not even going to bother with that show. The premise of the series itself is so ridiculous that I don\u2019t think it will get past two episodes. I think the writers on this show didn\u2019t understand the audience. They thought they had to make this show into something like Lost, which is something that nobody really wants from a TV show. It\u2019s like everybody wants to see an original and new show for the first time, but the writers think they need to make things a little bit harder on the audience. But as long as the writers find a way to put the pieces of this show together in a way that makes sense, I\u2019m going to enjoy this show, and for the last two episodes, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d","token_len":537,"entropy":[10.5977,6.4227,9.5389,10.7829,7.2208,0.7437,1.3396,2.7513,1.5136,5.7166,0.0126,5.1982,0.4968,7.5336,0.6455,0.5068,10.2782,4.6429,9.1521,6.516,3.7934,7.4826,0.4455,0.6945,0.4154,7.0324,1.9006,3.6713,1.8888,1.4754,5.8127,1.7015,5.772,2.3361,0.7081,5.0116,5.0736,2.2235,0.9895,3.1711,0.5904,4.5828,2.6277,0.8109,4.706,1.9487,5.2596,0.56,3.1968,5.0917,0.9201,3.3574,4.7066,0.3906,0.9882,1.1685,0.7532,1.9294,5.5587,1.7513,2.2715,2.2311,4.0835,2.0908,2.7153,3.9993,3.4711,0.552,6.5562,0.0057,8.9981,0.454,4.4722,3.382,0.6855,5.1472,1.7237,5.4513,4.2503,3.9668,16.8836,8.2777,0.6641,2.3021,0.0184,3.9021,0.2053,0.0059,1.9118,8.2248,4.2825,2.8686,4.1881,5.459,1.7551,1.0266,9.3106,1.1019,2.2932,0.8004,0.7875,1.4445,5.6119,0.2111,3.733,0.8696,4.1635,0.2061,1.242,2.37,3.1369,0.1793,0.0404,1.5653,4.6443,2.6527,4.713,1.1042,1.8623,7.9234,2.409,2.5726,0.6735,1.8597,2.191,2.0371,0.943,1.7593,2.34,0.8996,0.5699,0.0523,3.0049,3.4645,4.5669,2.5239,1.1685,4.6082,3.0021,1.0545,2.6062,1.8397,1.1593,2.8141,3.4558,1.1775,5.2589,1.4705,5.4063,0.0561,0.0095,0.3951,2.0482,3.7503,7.7938,0.3661,6.4873,2.0971,5.5587,3.0729,1.5937,3.8013,7.2122,3.9776,3.3545,0.8945,3.0263,1.4789,8.6086,2.7211,4.7893,7.0035,3.2747,0.0937,2.0408,0.2014,2.3358,1.7167,2.199,2.999,1.2203,0.9552,2.3275,6.4552,4.3811,7.097,0.8573,8.6278,0.2732,3.0862,3.0915,6.4198,1.07,10.139,0.132,0.058,0.6005,4.6875,4.0857,1.5097,6.2506,2.5489,1.9761,0.6086,0.8985,5.4658,1.8758,3.3049,0.0277,0.7743,4.306,3.4619,2.4164,1.5499,3.0323,7.6504,0.3389,0.5962,0.1119,0.0347,5.6467,2.6125,1.669,6.926,0.4767,2.1579,0.5763,0.5916,3.7552,1.3956,3.1244,3.7758,2.4809,0.3352,5.3297,1.1892,1.2113,3.9292,6.975,0.4454,1.83,3.772,2.2822,0.0945,0.1233,0.0088,0.4751,5.5359,0.6835,2.7148,1.1142,2.9979,4.1045,2.5809,1.1608,3.4732,1.8645,0.785,0.6216,1.214,0.0683,0.0569,0.0042,0.2375,2.3176,0.3454,2.2459,5.6487,1.4616,4.3006,0.6538,0.654,0.9149,1.8077,3.3701,4.4096,1.6133,2.2698,2.514,3.7869,5.0895,5.151,7.1706,0.5119,0.3536,0.5712,0.6817,1.9776,4.2671,0.4248,0.7671,1.8381,0.0209,1.4554,0.815,3.5921,3.9371,4.6749,1.9197,1.8937,1.1737,0.5254,7.7582,4.903,0.5119,1.5152,2.3885,1.3313,2.5217,5.9673,5.1161,7.1908,3.6755,7.075,4.443,0.3514,5.2408,4.9336,2.7193,2.2671,1.5579,4.1093,0.8302,1.7165,3.7515,5.0486,3.8426,2.9684,6.0718,1.9495,1.8728,2.8666,4.9438,0.9985,0.9543,0.3751,4.4906,1.0406,4.5936,1.4023,1.6546,3.4325,3.1296,0.6601,2.3005,3.945,2.6779,3.4678,2.4934,1.3651,0.1624,0.0026,1.3453,6.6101,4.2966,3.4705,3.1796,4.8244,1.8642,1.0863,3.9429,3.544,1.6379,5.1297,10.9872,5.7631,7.3684,1.1211,5.1582,8.6712,3.4447,2.5798,0.3762,1.4909,3.5271,2.0572,0.6564,1.1868,3.9703,1.9583,0.0463,3.1413,1.6026,1.0459,7.1104,1.3805,2.4271,4.982,1.0648,0.942,2.0717,5.3655,0.5367,3.6479,4.4535,0.9192,1.2238,1.504,0.0625,0.3253,0.0273,1.4967,1.0572,3.2235,3.5909,5.3302,5.6398,1.4296,1.0621,1.6744,1.8426,1.8652,2.1274,6.2451,1.1976,0.0804,5.7275,0.1768,0.9996,0.0456,3.7611,1.5675,3.7785,2.4411,1.507,4.1005,1.6596,1.6751,1.9055,3.0818,3.3853,1.2095,3.652,1.6487,5.1431,8.7862,1.2416,2.3237,1.0734,4.181,0.9141,4.4699,2.3782,2.6908,5.5539,0.7403,2.1383,0.2991,0.5115,2.6068,2.8315,0.1159,0.0577,3.1319,7.5634,2.9104,1.0679,2.0599,3.5532,4.0191,5.3892,5.0339,1.3945,4.5679,1.4774,0.3657,0.2662,1.4734,1.9422,2.827,2.6132,4.2237,0.9034,4.3778,0.2741,1.6085,5.6729,2.9624,0.1779,1.5233,4.6394,1.852,0.74,1.2105,0.9484,4.4556,4.1379,2.8759,0.0015,1.7449,3.1495,6.3137,1.2975,0.1595,0.0739,3.756,1.5525,5.6794,1.6978,1.7201,0.3901,0.2213,2.8598,0.6235,0.3588,0.0328,2.0857,1.9696,1.2364,1.478,4.1092,0.2307,0.2258,2.8439,0.0235,3.9765,2.0376,0.8711,3.0551,0.8696,5.3873,1.2802,4.4357,1.8244,1.7034,1.4104,3.9008,4.4449,0.0482,0.5137,1.9502,2.0263,1.594,0.2513,6.5068,5.6041]}

indeed some of the simpler forms of life possess more than one of the ingredients of life.\nFor example there < unk > are forms, such as the sea squirt, which contain no cell wall but only nuclei.\nIn most cases the whole body consists of one cell only and we can look forward to developing a system whereby the study of life will be greatly facilitated.\nAt the present time it is impossible to carry on a systematic study of all < unk > aspects of life.\nNevertheless I intend to investigate closely the possibility of life existing in water, but it is impossible at present to decide whether water is simply a suitable medium for the continuation of life or whether life can survive it.\nPerhaps we can hope eventually to understand one great mystery of the universe, namely, how matter came into existence.\nThere is much at present unexplained about the origin of matter.\nIt is possible that we have discovered one very important element in the chain by which this mystery will be solved.\nIt seems to me that it is extremely interesting to speculate on the possibility of life existing in water and that we might have some hope of discovering how matter came into existence.\n\n","token_len":539,"entropy":[8.236,8.8925,6.6037,3.8159,9.7376,6.7518,4.51,11.1355,3.0387,2.2223,5.9854,0.4749,0.0213,4.3905,0.0125,5.33,4.534,3.2494,8.8995,0.1647,0.5591,2.364,6.7837,12.4985,7.8802,5.256,10.0628,6.2312,1.0072,0.013,0.0654,1.8497,1.4814,1.6723,8.5382,7.2653,2.2491,1.8816,1.7086,3.2219,7.2093,1.6168,5.1653,2.6304,2.9292,0.778,2.2324,1.5029,2.4756,9.3286,0.5496,2.4949,1.4637,4.4273,3.4194,3.945,0.3958,0.1029,5.5294,0.5792,0.0261,0.0473,0.3971,1.7612,4.8821,1.8593,0.1285,3.1369,2.7885,5.09,0.2684,6.1537,0.038,4.9915,1.4384,0.7631,2.001,6.2227,6.386,2.8408,2.5543,8.7754,4.3411,3.6743,0.0416,1.7593,4.689,3.1654,1.0465,3.5308,4.7874,2.4438,3.281,2.5206,1.068,3.7586,2.4027,4.7141,7.8147,5.6683,0.4293,0.7575,3.1478,0.4716,3.4253,2.8715,4.0687,8.6006,6.5119,6.7926,7.1267,2.3971,6.4487,0.026,1.6564,4.5423,0.873,5.7566,2.887,4.0413,1.4422,0.3922,5.3191,6.3583,2.514,2.0052,1.0867,2.1142,4.6065,4.7664,1.0487,0.8678,2.564,4.9529,0.8822,0.4917,1.3549,4.5876,6.35,0.3312,1.8066,2.2689,0.8207,1.1253,3.3082,3.3778,0.3677,6.5221,1.9939,0.0074,4.6098,3.216,0.3639,2.5101,0.6156,2.1225,0.8666,4.3741,8.1308,4.8845,9.5669,0.0045,4.3268,3.9661,2.5623,0.4335,3.3441,2.3735,0.3233,5.2304,1.1814,1.0074,3.4757,8.2287,7.4765,3.6808,3.6585,6.2808,3.6845,3.2342,0.7716,0.4226,2.6928,0.5979,2.257,6.3907,3.3933,4.71,1.2959,3.7641,0.0207,2.1283,1.5646,2.4766,2.0485,3.5758,0.7445,2.4536,0.1051,3.1732,8.8579,1.3246,4.0764,2.2564,2.1899,1.4434,0.3706,0.3628,3.3798,3.4413,0.9564,2.8338,8.3275,1.8371,1.4394,1.3053,5.074,2.8899,9.35,3.7173,3.1722,1.471,4.8823,2.4774,2.6006,3.3263,2.5933,2.1803,2.7094,1.7676,10.48,4.0529,7.1709,0.959,7.5533,1.4049,3.3737,1.6792,3.4286,1.9901,0.4483,2.0553,1.4449,0.4021,1.4009,3.7197,5.0338,1.2218,0.8547,2.3139,2.6035,5.5718,0.8409,0.3933,0.5639,4.477,0.6331,0.3377,1.2069,0.5283,0.1657,0.7516,1.2759,3.6288,9.0855,0.7011,0.6075,0.5667,0.1966,0.365,0.5961,3.6741,2.1522,1.373,1.8737,4.0675,0.6018,1.4781,1.8119,2.8577,1.4122,2.9909,0.4104,0.2472,4.6647,2.6602,0.0537,6.45,1.605,6.9143,2.4618,1.4309,7.5147,1.7654,1.7424,1.3412,1.2061,0.7513,1.9945,8.1159,5.2166,4.8118,2.045,0.3926,5.2169,4.0579,0.225,0.1132,7.9172,2.7949,2.8112,0.2448,4.2106,1.2979,8.3866,2.7932,0.2238,0.4262,0.3123,4.2615,0.6017,3.8916,14.3985,0.7658,0.0039,0.0175,4.1392,6.5138,5.1329,1.5295,0.002,1.8655,8.1175,8.2823,2.7109,1.1154,0.6007,4.5095,3.317,3.9714,5.6973,2.1032,2.7084,6.4462,0.1008,1.16,0.6038,3.3144,4.7102,1.2558,1.6506,4.6906,1.4895,3.7452,0.1745,3.0073,2.131,5.5055,1.9232,5.4876,2.279,5.7851,3.0718,0.2423,4.9603,1.6977,4.1446,4.8724,2.0062,10.9027,0.114,2.2218,2.86,1.4293,6.2029,2.5598,1.1141,0.2281,5.2691,1.2127,2.6453,0.5225,2.5043,0.4628,3.2662,0.2248,5.4009,4.3929,2.4453,3.7876,0.5828,0.2417,3.1917,10.5485,0.0775,0.0017,0.0021,7.402,0.1256,0.2253,1.0891,0.4902,5.3536,2.659,6.9023,0.1668,5.3356,6.2879,0.8903,3.6042,0.7109,3.3387,5.5204,1.1413,6.9905,1.6917,4.3458,2.7053,0.7085,3.522,4.6877,0.4307,0.3885,6.392,1.6373,3.2092,0.9779,5.7228,1.0517,5.9602,2.3416,0.5761,3.2329,9.1437,0.0791,0.3651,1.9684,0.4466,1.9002,2.6147,3.67,5.3288,0.5724,0.2309,5.862,2.7948,1.5288,5.3264,6.6609,1.0324,3.5663,5.9912,7.2246,3.8496,0.944,1.8204,1.1202,1.8471,3.0774,2.1941,2.3852,5.0242,4.7716,1.0649,0.7731,0.8224,0.3314,3.4867,1.0057,3.9136,5.3033,4.1842,5.192,1.2075,0.5835,0.9934,0.0986,1.4769,0.6864,0.4039,2.2757,0.8255,3.1388,0.2613,3.4714,1.427,3.2175,3.8053,4.3583,1.1,4.1995,1.8312,0.6475,8.388,6.459,1.2903,5.2476,2.9543,5.9157,0.6538,0.4055,0.3968,0.1646,1.7732,3.4963,1.3317,0.0758,0.3074,2.722,0.5003,5.1568,3.9827,0.6747,4.2986,1.1039,0.8617,4.1826,0.4445,1.8474,3.5942,0.3793,0.7424,2.4365,3.7467,2.4457,2.3402,2.5167,3.6279,4.1318,0.4713,2.0997,3.6716,2.0835,0.9846,0.3052,0.095,0.4508,6.4793]}

Island reported 100 mm ( 4 inches ) of rain by September 16, well before the typhoon hit, while Busan had reported 60 mm ( 2 inches ) and Naju had reported 30 mm ( 1 inch ) since September 14.\nThis year the weather is forecast to be wetter than normal from May to October.\nThe report said that the water level is likely to rise in most areas by the month of September.\nForecasters, however, said that a major increase in water levels would be seen only following heavy rains during the typhoon season.\nThe report said that water levels had begun to fall after the passage of Typhoon Chan-hyeol in late August, having peaked in mid-September.\nThe flood warning committee said that high water levels were expected in September and that the level was expected to peak around the end of the month, though a major increase in water levels would not be expected until the typhoon season begins in October.\nThe forecasting team is studying the possibility of a severe flood and warned that, if necessary, it could also declare a disaster state.\nThe flood warning committee said it had asked for all waterways to be maintained in a state free from debris because debris could slow boats in the event of a flood.\nThe committee also ordered all boats and ships to be kept on the high alert and all coastal roads to be kept clear from debris.\nThe committee also ordered the deployment of rescue workers to each region.\nThe government said that its efforts to stop the spread of hepatitis A were under way and urged all those with hepatitis A to consult their doctors immediately.\nThe government has also issued an advisory to all pregnant women on how to protect themselves against hepatitis A and said that pregnant women should avoid getting in direct contact with those with acute cases and should take special precautions against infections such as sores on their legs or mouth.\nThe government also urged health workers to keep their hepatitis B vaccination records up to date.\nThe ministry of education asked students to wear clean shoes and to change socks frequently in classrooms.\nThe ministry said that it would increase the number of checkups at schools and hospitals for their students.\nWith the goal of preventing a major flood, the ministry of infrastructure prepared flood prevention plans and issued evacuation instructions to people living near the

{"prompt":"The working title for the episode was `` New Girl `` , which changed to the current `` Day One `` by the beginning of October 2006 . Head writer Chris Chibnall , who wrote","text":"The working title for the episode was `` New Girl ``, which changed to the current `` Day One `` by the beginning of October 2006. Head writer Chris Chibnall, who wrote both episodes, made a departure from his debut as writer on the show, with the episode instead focusing loosely on a group of three friends who had come of age and started taking their lives in their own hands.\nIt was the last episode written by Chibnall until the first season ended in early 2007, with John Wells and Tom Longhurst working on it instead. It also marks the last time the title `` New Girl `` was used on a show, but the original title \"\" Day One \"\", the week it was filmed, was used to promote the series in the early weeks.\nDay One was written entirely in the third person, and although that has been tried before and usually works well, this one was not without issues for the cast, who found it difficult to adjust to a new format that took them out of the narrative centre and put viewers and viewers within the character's heads instead.\nDay One was written in the third person, which was not something they had tried before. Jessica and Jessie both have a strong view as to who has to be there, whereas Jess is very much a character who is seen as an outsider and it becomes much easier to say the same things for her in third person. Jessie was a great character in terms of bringing out her differences, and she was very different from Jess, but I think they both bring something new to the show.\nThe ending of the episode, in its final version, ended with the girls leaving the caf\u00e9 and Jessie standing atop a building, wearing a nightie and a scarf, watching the girls walk out into the night. When they were shown leaving the caf\u00e9, it took some of the tension out of the scene. They didn't stay there very long.\nAfter her breakup with Taylor, Jessie starts meeting older men who she likes. She then starts to date the older man who she starts working with in the restaurant and, as a result, her life becomes very different. She's at work when Jess comes to get her, but she doesn't know her name and begins her interrogation by asking, \"Who is Jessie?\"\nOne notable scene in the episode takes place in the restaurant, when a date of Jessie's is about to arrive. She tells him how much she likes to wear a nightie and have a scarf on and shows him her scarf. This can be seen on television and in the DVD bonus features. However, Jessie was never shown wearing a nightie in the show in any episode prior to this.","token_len":541,"entropy":[8.3549,4.5549,1.8257,1.3213,4.452,1.5692,9.1155,12.2816,4.5749,3.9661,1.9037,1.1916,7.903,2.7996,3.1835,6.2042,4.4095,8.8053,3.8678,2.5634,4.8879,2.0562,6.2315,0.0213,4.5223,4.9419,0.2807,9.8023,1.9789,5.2711,5.1476,1.3561,0.0862,0.0194,2.9262,0.6696,2.4644,4.6564,1.2349,0.4293,5.332,1.7,7.2728,1.4082,2.7652,8.6415,2.43,5.3354,2.1907,0.7449,1.5333,1.9998,3.6064,1.2751,4.0016,7.3067,2.8785,9.7532,0.0347,2.4177,3.8475,0.0378,6.0079,3.8468,1.1449,4.4453,3.6205,5.4888,0.0045,4.4362,4.0772,4.3168,2.6766,2.2022,2.3606,3.0359,1.7764,5.2747,0.2572,2.1522,8.8665,0.8813,2.5104,3.8329,0.7258,5.9154,0.8696,0.9404,0.0076,0.0012,0.0029,6.1744,1.7184,4.3995,1.1334,4.4568,1.288,4.0161,1.6634,0.7462,3.5096,5.3038,7.6848,2.7041,4.6336,11.8718,0.2346,4.412,0.3877,2.5647,6.6114,0.3541,3.0069,2.7414,4.7199,0.237,2.4209,0.9465,2.0169,5.01,6.5929,2.6744,0.0112,1.9265,0.4881,0.5059,2.552,1.2754,2.7509,3.0502,3.0723,2.1955,4.3225,1.4319,12.7974,9.1413,0.0255,2.3224,10.9959,2.9355,8.055,3.6733,0.5844,5.2987,0.3471,0.632,1.441,3.1348,4.4173,0.6186,2.5914,3.431,1.6122,2.2519,4.763,3.8485,0.9481,6.4025,0.2833,1.4216,2.8981,6.8196,2.2949,1.7724,5.7538,0.791,0.9822,1.8287,5.6045,4.9447,3.9856,1.2066,6.7934,2.0553,3.992,5.5893,1.8139,1.607,0.4802,2.9457,2.7578,1.6586,3.0514,5.4765,4.6787,5.3629,1.7303,3.3405,1.9192,1.7869,3.8626,1.2317,1.3679,0.1315,5.7779,0.6555,3.0699,1.2152,2.8138,3.8718,4.9733,1.7661,3.4254,0.0398,0.7624,5.8081,10.5,3.2524,5.0822,7.1727,5.0542,2.0081,6.9352,0.6062,4.2365,1.119,5.7416,6.6184,0.4943,1.5212,2.976,0.2029,1.1957,3.0376,1.6023,1.175,1.9177,0.1101,0.7879,3.2935,1.5312,3.1844,5.1542,2.82,1.8003,3.2213,0.6467,1.4806,9.922,4.28,7.7009,5.3899,4.267,2.4534,4.3763,5.7763,6.8933,0.9452,2.1178,4.589,2.7845,1.7622,5.1193,1.8191,5.1242,5.0423,2.6527,3.806,1.5908,1.623,2.3793,1.8776,1.4763,3.6895,0.672,3.0465,2.5101,2.2285,5.3233,5.5016,3.7471,1.4528,0.7544,5.2596,3.7111,1.8748,2.8852,4.5508,2.2053,3.0375,6.593,0.2024,0.6414,5.064,2.3277,2.7068,4.4927,1.6314,2.301,5.3977,0.0016,6.8345,2.8445,1.7033,6.0636,1.4389,1.709,2.1788,1.35,2.837,4.6787,0.5352,4.7179,1.6937,1.9021,4.3438,1.2113,3.4131,1.9137,8.0157,3.1921,2.3161,0.6116,0.2537,1.4551,0.9925,0.7661,2.0033,5.7132,0.8713,0.8865,0.3612,2.1969,3.224,4.617,3.0548,4.8615,0.1961,5.828,1.0721,1.2401,4.8151,3.1502,0.897,8.6818,1.462,6.5059,4.6234,6.1534,1.0328,4.1918,1.8548,5.1167,1.2026,6.688,2.3764,1.7733,1.9467,3.5744,1.586,4.2939,1.1291,4.6116,2.1353,1.9329,3.4037,0.1128,2.1891,0.5913,4.2799,1.583,2.8198,6.0341,2.7613,1.2699,0.415,0.2915,2.826,4.6581,2.8295,3.0341,0.4413,2.7146,0.7215,0.0685,0.4246,1.9579,2.3207,3.611,3.9431,0.001,5.185,1.5448,4.012,0.0079,2.487,1.3482,4.2937,7.2798,6.1281,0.4668,7.5574,0.4276,1.5368,6.8045,5.6175,5.8262,1.8228,2.1403,2.9959,4.4919,2.0382,2.0156,4.7058,2.9108,1.5717,2.6536,3.3654,1.7741,2.6299,1.8767,1.6831,7.2134,6.4085,0.1243,3.1069,0.988,3.0218,2.9044,4.134,2.5559,1.4634,0.143,0.1134,3.7677,3.557,2.3476,3.0756,0.8205,0.904,1.8868,3.4396,5.5724,3.7712,4.3023,5.4646,2.731,1.7432,4.4612,0.067,1.3687,1.9808,1.0248,1.8605,0.0003,2.5567,3.4917,2.9839,2.5284,5.8498,5.7053,10.4886,3.2896,2.0267,3.9111,0.6458,2.7854,1.2955,6.132,0.5713,1.3437,5.0117,6.6201,2.4446,1.2777,0.461,0.4229,5.058,0.0284,1.4977,0.6567,2.2464,1.2538,2.1297,2.7455,8.0611,4.5632,2.1031,0.2958,1.898,4.853,0.0112,6.0701,0.6267,2.1875,3.4294,2.1794,4.6716,1.9464,0.1933,2.1738,3.625,5.4653,0.8592,1.9447,0.0199,0.9536,6.5952,1.2183,3.6088,2.3966,3.2312,6.6031,0.1685,1.935,4.2022,1.4529,3.584,5.7423,0.4248,0.8407,2.9637,5.2798,2.719,1.5325,1.0174,4.561,6.2483,2.44,1.4125,4.4774,0.0561,3.4255,3.61,1.7553,1.905,1.3408,0.9503,2.3257,0.0083,2.1785,0.4012,3.5419,4.7595,2.3959,2.8224,5.0636,0.0177,2.4823,1.6984]}

{"prompt":"Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health , the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation . The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in","text":"Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Environment (ConEco) concluded in its EFSA Journal 2014, that there is no risk of carcinogens or other adverse health effects resulting from exposure to cadmium in the European Union. This conclusion is based on data indicating the absence of an adverse effect in animal studies and the absence of toxicological evidence when considering human exposure. In a recent report, however, ConEco also observed that several studies have shown that in fish tissue exposed to cadmium there was a reduction in antioxidant enzymes. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Environment (ConEco) concluded that this can lead to an accumulation of potentially toxic free radicals in cells, resulting in a further increase in the oxidative stress level. In contrast, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), considers cadmium as a priority substance for the management of persistent organic pollutants. The ECHA has already identified several chemical production sectors and uses for which the use of cadmium is considered to be restricted. The ECHA is also working to ensure that the use restrictions are also implemented during the lifetime of the products in question.\nIn conclusion, the presence of cadmium in our environment due to the use of cadmium and cadmium-containing products has negative implications for human health. Therefore, we believe that consumers are entitled to know whether the product they use has cadmium. The presence of cadmium in products is, however, of little value to the public since this product could in principle also contain other contaminants and the fact that cadmium is present in such products does not exclude the possibility of other contaminants being present. Moreover, cadmium exposure can also occur naturally to humans, i.e. through atmospheric emission of cadmium. Therefore, when deciding on a product, consumers should look for a green, clean label or read the information about the product on the packaging to make sure there are no problems with cadmium before the products are used.\nThe presence of arsenic in our environment due to the use of arsenic-containing products has adverse effects on human health. The European Community has implemented a measure in 2007 to restrict the use of arsenic to a limited number of products based on scientific considerations. This measure does not replace the general restrictions imposed by the European Union on the use of arsenic and arsenicals. It should be stressed that the presence of arsenic in products is of little value to the public since this product could in principle also contain other contaminants.","token_len":542,"entropy":[2.828,1.2492,8.3238,1.2532,1.1888,9.9088,0.0345,0.0007,2.8333,1.6632,3.8822,1.964,1.957,0.0434,0.1555,1.7111,8.5458,3.1465,1.912,0.0225,1.5325,0.0035,0.0002,1.7679,3.7436,2.1184,4.2363,5.848,1.2408,10.3456,4.2822,7.4025,0.6462,1.9719,9.3692,0.9025,9.3244,2.6016,4.8086,0.3072,0.4575,2.7304,1.483,1.8515,1.4945,7.6892,7.5548,6.6506,1.0844,3.8388,1.7884,2.996,7.5387,0.1474,6.5279,4.8543,2.9497,1.9442,2.8234,0.5996,0.927,5.1793,1.0515,4.2468,2.3872,2.2583,1.4797,3.8637,1.0097,0.1985,4.479,0.0126,1.3425,0.0937,0.5922,0.0027,0.0002,1.2553,1.3492,4.0042,0.8357,0.6199,3.8193,3.0646,0.9758,0.7334,0.1334,3.2036,6.3823,3.3175,4.163,0.0401,3.0424,1.6643,1.3286,3.6391,7.493,1.9793,2.3164,2.1451,1.9173,0.0094,5.5857,1.3427,1.7134,7.0186,3.7082,4.6491,1.2704,1.1855,2.694,3.7421,1.993,2.5833,1.0185,6.0479,0.0008,5.6313,0.2243,0.0019,4.0497,5.0296,1.3158,5.9161,2.3679,1.7617,1.9293,0.9553,4.7453,8.1335,8.6476,5.5993,0.0456,0.9898,0.0074,0.0003,4.6887,2.6981,1.2052,3.3182,0.1201,7.6146,3.6905,2.2728,2.2027,3.447,0.019,0.855,0.6165,0.1733,0.0029,0.0015,0.0207,0.0054,0.0055,0.8384,0.0866,0.0067,0.0014,0.0232,1.3152,0.4729,3.2166,5.3726,2.9906,0.0123,2.472,4.5252,0.0249,4.9878,1.3707,5.9879,0.2128,1.5688,5.7234,1.954,2.5304,0.0153,1.8572,5.9556,1.4512,0.142,0.9293,4.9333,0.5067,3.3403,1.0561,2.2555,4.0053,0.2595,1.5214,2.9477,8.0316,0.0881,1.0843,0.6645,0.4473,3.8947,3.1635,6.8454,3.713,0.0108,0.0004,1.4011,0.5565,8.5928,4.0388,1.1995,1.7844,3.4678,0.0478,8.315,3.4791,0.3262,1.4889,1.6381,2.0268,3.2874,2.5443,4.612,3.6762,3.14,4.8604,8.0281,6.0673,3.2425,5.6448,3.2884,3.6888,2.4132,2.4063,0.0292,0.1445,0.0046,0.0002,0.9872,3.1419,2.0701,0.2628,5.3087,0.7869,1.75,1.2463,0.0362,3.3666,2.3097,3.302,1.6573,3.1554,0.4329,1.3737,1.4719,10.0726,1.4285,5.5639,2.1899,5.8182,0.7432,6.0253,0.0622,0.6186,4.431,2.7877,2.7587,0.3137,1.454,11.4181,2.8515,0.0767,0.5942,5.4056,0.1005,0.5731,0.0049,0.0002,0.3409,5.1653,3.6187,7.0135,0.0031,1.4956,3.0659,0.1165,1.8159,0.0107,0.0003,4.0224,4.8702,0.0933,0.0712,0.8164,1.0546,1.7066,2.6338,5.8111,3.1509,0.3564,1.7062,0.0229,1.1321,4.3069,0.1441,2.8567,3.5929,0.3735,6.937,3.2655,2.7991,0.0134,2.1397,2.5078,1.7794,3.1809,2.1408,3.1998,1.94,3.4596,0.0185,0.0006,2.1879,2.2405,3.6122,0.0724,0.2836,0.0067,0.0003,0.5652,3.9434,1.6794,5.3938,1.1664,0.0032,3.7788,4.3319,3.5055,1.6613,1.1925,1.9356,4.6443,3.6965,2.3731,3.8311,5.6172,3.0369,5.6825,3.0535,2.7663,2.8892,2.8905,4.2579,5.5603,0.0923,3.0611,0.0082,0.0004,0.9495,2.5514,0.2411,3.9227,0.2621,2.7384,0.0165,6.1419,0.56,0.5585,0.9961,4.0944,3.0275,2.7482,0.3596,0.9409,3.9346,0.0054,5.482,0.0084,0.0007,3.4238,2.6455,2.2151,4.0229,6.7555,5.2203,1.6421,1.7437,6.9228,0.0016,0.001,0.9675,2.5204,8.1719,6.7376,1.1615,1.6735,0.0046,0.0012,1.2348,2.4883,0.0708,5.2232,6.1997,1.562,2.5823,0.9415,1.781,2.2007,0.3837,4.9628,1.7647,2.4457,9.0615,3.2021,2.8313,5.2433,3.9528,6.8257,0.8876,3.623,2.648,0.8227,1.6401,2.5689,0.3817,3.388,3.5543,2.161,0.3912,3.1602,1.4754,0.2742,4.3214,1.1937,3.0129,0.0077,0.0004,5.7815,3.3833,5.3773,0.2491,2.3385,0.2455,0.9159,2.219,4.7314,0.0629,5.3224,0.6231,1.5787,1.5687,4.2352,0.0014,0.5203,0.3942,0.0018,0.7938,0.4267,0.1105,0.2283,1.4276,3.2197,1.1897,0.4544,0.8007,0.012,0.3904,1.8955,3.4839,5.2621,1.372,4.1922,1.6754,6.4447,3.1437,3.8588,0.9893,3.3776,0.5337,0.8346,0.0524,0.4227,3.8697,3.4265,2.493,3.0967,0.0028,1.0163,4.7445,0.0272,4.1968,5.4724,0.5647,1.8422,1.3289,5.0167,0.0705,6.8824,0.5716,6.5078,4.9978,2.6952,0.7202,0.3103,1.5918,1.882,1.377,0.7853,0.675,0.0355,0.2893,2.8613,10.0757,3.2716,1.112,3.131,4.7077,0.882,4.711,0.1464,1.0858,4.8623,0.0527,0.2164,0.3509,2.5933,0.9543,1.4792,0.6286,0.6909,0.3195,0.2797,0.0435,0.568,0.3354,0.0271,0.1793,0.1752,0.0826,0.5829,0.0208,0.0259,0.0579,1.89]}
{"prompt":"As older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared , new forms arose . One of these , the electric trolley , began operation in Lock Haven in 1894 . The Lock Haven","text":"As older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric trolley line, which extended from the railroad to downtown began operations on December 31st of that th e year. It was the forerunner of many of the electric trolley lines of the late nineteenth century. One of the principal features of t e trolley in its early days was its unusually convenient method of operating. The engine was always started and stopped at prearranged points along the line. There was no danger of train breakdowns because there was no sprockets, gears, or rails.\nLock Haven's electric trolley and others such as the Neshaminy trolley line and one at West Chester began operating regularly by the end of the century. After the Civil War, trolley lines were built in several of t he other Pennsylvania towns, includ ing Lancaster and Westmoreland. Many of these trolley lines would be operated by one company in more than one county. In addition, these lines were often extended to other towns in the same county.\nAnother type of vehicle, the passenger vehicle, continued in use after cars began to appear. The main advantage of passenger cars compared with streetcar was the increased speed. For the most part, people favored cars because the electric motor could be controlled. One or two people or even a family could also be transported in cars. In addition, cars were more comfortable than streetcars.\nOne car company which began after the Civil War carried a large number of passengers was the Barker and Sons. The company operated a line from Lancaster to Newark, across the Sussex county line. Barker and Sons was one of the earliest in Pennsylvania to offer horse-drawn railcars by passenger service. For a fee, passengers could enjoy riding with the horses pulling the cars.\nIn 1873, the Barker and sons had cars hauled by oxen and in 1878, by donkeys. In the early days of passenger cars in Pennsylvania, t h e cars for passenger use were usually built by the car manufacturers.\nPennsylvania Railroad cars used for commuter service.\nAlthough many private car companies were formed during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was the General Engineering and Trading Company of Philadelphia which built the majority of the cars used by these companies. In the early 1900's, companies began using automobiles as a means of traveling from point A to point B. These were primarily used for commute nts and excursions where cars could follow established paths or roads. By 1910, automobiles and trolley cars were operating from most towns throughout the state of Pennsylvania.","token_len":542,"entropy":[9.4984,7.486,0.2031,6.3837,2.4402,0.0012,3.1199,9.5675,6.9775,11.3243,1.7776,5.7716,1.6119,7.0942,1.473,4.4518,0.9642,0.9303,2.7802,0.8238,5.9967,4.4469,0.0167,0.3895,3.7238,7.0331,0.425,11.8266,1.4572,0.7398,1.4505,3.919,0.7385,1.7626,9.4221,0.014,1.7746,2.3543,0.0099,5.335,2.7167,1.0702,4.9807,0.5798,2.0833,5.773,2.8906,4.2113,8.5877,2.9102,2.9786,3.3161,3.6486,2.9962,3.5745,0.438,14.8032,6.6262,1.658,0.4212,3.0877,1.0812,1.9648,10.2677,0.1581,0.2243,5.0321,1.335,0.2384,2.9414,0.869,0.5304,0.4969,2.7052,0.2068,2.8367,1.5727,0.1213,0.5944,4.4996,0.4105,0.3765,6.0618,3.229,0.1175,5.263,7.5722,2.9873,0.89,4.95,4.6,0.9914,1.5235,0.1648,1.2547,8.0211,5.9858,5.6371,0.1355,4.3485,0.7283,1.3254,6.9662,1.53,5.0824,5.7959,2.9053,3.5971,1.3844,9.0238,4.1623,0.0838,2.5095,3.3288,0.2406,1.5947,0.8791,4.2219,0.8556,1.0274,5.9283,0.1666,6.3423,5.6135,1.5297,4.3179,3.3871,0.4001,0.4616,8.1783,3.5322,0.1133,2.2438,6.1335,0.6198,0.6572,5.3387,1.1248,3.9174,15.7591,0.0058,3.2288,1.8646,0.2408,0.0292,5.4453,6.0754,2.8289,0.0258,1.6434,6.5918,5.1645,3.1077,9.7535,2.9311,0.0132,3.9611,3.2306,6.8105,5.483,5.0003,4.7922,3.6038,2.088,7.1735,4.7968,2.0962,0.8427,0.0031,0.5505,2.5376,0.2269,5.2958,0.9737,4.1287,0.0262,0.6406,2.9374,0.4736,2.16,1.3898,4.4541,1.5775,2.8654,4.5825,8.8487,1.9746,5.6278,7.2061,1.1759,1.8577,8.469,0.5664,5.5321,1.4381,4.2893,3.3341,0.0017,0.4347,4.1872,0.7491,1.0557,1.0741,0.0949,0.1984,5.1681,1.6322,3.4624,0.7249,5.7867,3.2416,3.0298,5.8681,0.0624,0.9261,2.671,0.6496,2.5499,3.1101,0.9145,4.7359,2.5593,1.2817,3.4462,5.2534,1.382,1.5943,1.3245,2.1469,0.6795,1.8674,1.2112,0.8604,1.811,5.3492,3.7465,0.0453,7.2672,2.4217,0.7577,5.5724,3.8481,0.2313,4.1661,3.5704,1.0702,4.3809,9.7122,2.9483,0.4746,4.2697,1.5509,1.5657,5.9658,3.9043,0.1578,1.6429,1.6364,7.2975,1.3145,6.3592,1.8039,1.6388,4.0751,2.1291,2.1873,4.7636,2.2538,2.0259,0.0017,0.2634,4.8451,7.7983,3.4835,3.724,2.8023,4.5205,3.6774,2.1774,1.3239,4.4553,2.5147,4.676,6.3038,0.4351,2.7232,5.9344,3.1791,1.1071,4.4507,1.2011,5.8178,2.6993,4.6357,2.0762,4.6384,0.7777,2.7539,2.0164,0.1493,3.4401,1.0366,2.7342,2.2574,2.447,4.7431,0.0955,0.9436,1.7273,3.5141,5.2842,6.2807,5.8505,3.4288,8.3295,1.0399,0.5289,0.0033,4.2043,1.9631,2.6016,0.8134,0.0059,2.4218,6.6965,1.1387,10.4496,4.3628,5.9759,1.9751,1.5489,1.2326,2.1883,1.8652,4.1472,2.1882,3.8305,0.4305,7.2296,1.4312,7.9675,0.4594,8.2118,4.5331,0.1027,0.841,3.3106,1.1678,0.0235,2.4244,3.1216,0.0256,0.3539,3.0797,4.8591,1.4156,0.9347,3.6603,8.0749,2.0235,0.0667,6.0848,1.9245,6.3737,5.2232,2.4054,0.2926,5.1398,2.6848,5.4373,0.689,1.9703,0.8182,5.6803,4.897,3.8137,1.8155,3.4015,10.9295,1.719,3.4293,1.0568,2.1858,2.667,1.7672,3.962,0.3415,1.2171,2.6771,0.2846,8.9753,4.6791,8.2343,7.8185,1.2492,8.1727,0.1011,1.5101,5.5594,2.0349,2.4703,0.795,4.1856,9.5323,0.1505,1.1754,1.7138,2.5068,2.1409,3.4675,0.497,1.8809,1.5195,3.2767,1.3107,0.1576,4.8417,5.5948,1.9881,2.7636,6.895,3.9753,2.564,0.4768,3.7643,4.087,2.1169,2.1203,6.4314,3.8698,0.8446,2.2992,5.4672,0.0086,2.8597,6.2605,4.7079,3.4206,6.4529,2.1713,3.7652,1.1658,5.4682,3.2811,6.1823,2.7113,0.5713,2.6846,3.7071,2.5825,0.1809,3.5918,0.7494,0.0124,0.02,0.8985,0.008,0.2578,3.5215,0.7598,2.1185,6.0102,9.7838,2.2544,8.2193,0.4915,1.1197,2.2402,1.2302,3.7175,1.1078,5.1126,0.0184,0.9411,3.7891,1.668,1.4068,4.9551,0.7996,0.3846,2.6438,1.8865,1.2143,2.3986,0.728,0.3028,6.5867,2.602,2.6385,3.904,2.0831,2.0837,0.791,0.2133,3.8557,3.3704,5.1701,0.145,0.1222,0.3308,0.0408,0.6987,2.9034,4.4297,4.4353,2.0663,0.9,8.3158,8.109,4.1449,2.0351,7.4366,0.2921,5.9849,3.9129,1.4341,8.9175,7.147,4.6054,3.3792,5.3017,0.4731,4.4366,3.2685,0.1813,3.6068,4.5253,3.2957,0.735,2.0077,0.6541,6.095,5.5177,5.2643,3.6858,3.1348,0.4997,1.1071,1.8448,0.077,0.3575]}

249\nThese engine designs are less powerful than either the BSB 2 or the turbojet, but also very efficient for their size. 246, 249, 250, 251\nA very high performance variant of the BSB 2 engine with a power rating of 5,000\u00a0hp, rated at 14,000\u00a0lb of thrust (7,000\u00a0kN) and operating at 5,100-6,000\u00a0RPM. 249\nBased upon earlier piston engines developed for piston-jet aircraft by the British Air Ministry, these engines were the first designed and built for turbocharged piston engines. 249\nThese were designed and built by BSB under license from Aerojet Rocketdyne of

{"prompt":"A fictionalized version of the events of this election were presented in third and fourth seasons of The Wire , a drama about crime and politics in Baltimore , which aired in 2004 and 2006","text":"A fictionalized version of the events of this election were presented in third and fourth seasons of The Wire, a drama about crime and politics in Baltimore, which aired in 2004 and 2006 in the United States.The series was based on the true story of a journalist who broke the story of corruption in Baltimore, and the police and their links to the crime, in an investigation that ultimately forced Governor Martin M. King III from office, despite a fair verdict. A fifth season of The Wire, titled Baltimore, aired on May 16, 2012, and the episodes were written by the original writers.\nDuring the early stages of development, a large number of people have been working hard on this project for more than a year to bring it to the public. If you find this tutorial helpful, keep in mind that you will need to provide a solution to our task and improve upon it during the final stage of development. Your participation will be vital for the success of our project. Thank you very much.\nI would like to learn about how to install Xposed framework and the components needed for the application.\nI am a Computer Engineering student and I had a lot of experience and research in making a similar application using Arduino. Please make an inquiry on my mail address as soon as possible.\nJust a heads up here. Since last September, I\u2019ve been running the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS kernel 4.8.10-0ubuntu4 on a Dell XPS M1330. The last update, 4.9, has been slow to make the transition into the live filesystem. I\u2019ve only been able to do so after rebooting in recovery mode. This doesn\u2019t appear to be the case elsewhere, but there are at least two other articles I\u2019ve read (this one and this one) which mention that the slow transition is caused by a bug in the kernel.\nNow, this isn\u2019t an issue that is unique to this particular machine \u2013 there have been various reports of slow boot transitions that appear to have multiple causes, including some of the changes to the linux kernel itself. The fix would probably be a patch in the kernel, or perhaps even a kernel update. However, just because a solution has been confirmed, and an official fix exists, doesn\u2019t mean that it or the next update will arrive in time to avoid damage to the live filesystem. I don\u2019t think anyone would mind waiting a little longer if the change doesn\u2019t have any other effect on the OS beyond slow startup, but that\u2019s a matter for you and your network if you plan to use live kernels for development or for sharing the distro.","token_len":545,"entropy":[11.3944,3.2117,0.5034,0.1136,0.9858,4.4524,0.6807,4.9203,8.5475,6.6839,4.1969,1.0061,9.3744,5.5121,0.8338,5.1664,0.6929,2.468,3.2569,1.3211,3.3971,4.5148,1.6988,5.9556,0.9094,2.6781,2.1012,4.1341,1.6581,2.878,1.7588,1.3743,4.1111,2.091,2.758,5.1933,0.6281,1.3643,0.0859,0.4785,6.9474,3.1161,1.8874,3.0066,0.1087,0.8307,4.3524,0.4827,0.0613,2.3155,6.4439,0.7662,5.5881,0.8111,1.0874,0.217,5.3851,0.8158,1.2307,1.7817,1.7122,2.4009,4.4038,3.0448,3.963,8.3984,0.1828,1.1736,3.5348,3.864,2.7508,3.0082,4.9819,1.4548,3.7683,6.7896,6.0695,1.6479,7.6986,0.016,8.5273,3.4627,4.1711,0.1146,3.264,5.1049,3.2383,8.4405,7.6133,1.315,4.3669,6.6123,0.2102,1.5571,0.7423,0.0183,2.1734,3.9392,4.5943,1.4115,1.7813,2.4297,3.3568,3.6054,0.1543,3.1824,1.1808,1.1076,2.5356,5.2493,1.1979,3.0822,0.3478,3.6127,4.6782,1.1354,1.2263,2.4901,17.0449,0.557,4.1733,3.01,0.0115,3.5592,0.8195,3.7302,4.739,1.1994,0.0059,4.1759,4.963,1.929,4.1911,5.1329,1.6894,2.3341,1.0278,3.0014,3.5795,0.0063,0.9356,0.7604,3.0069,2.9458,1.2946,0.1645,2.4524,3.3957,1.3643,6.1064,0.3482,5.0584,2.6176,8.7788,0.8565,0.2595,6.5084,1.9519,0.0848,0.1832,2.73,1.6222,0.8394,0.6251,4.6961,2.0871,9.2796,0.8632,4.444,7.2433,2.7272,7.7802,2.9505,0.5406,4.8988,0.8728,3.3839,3.8758,0.2806,0.8648,0.3218,5.5571,4.978,1.301,2.1625,4.4361,2.6872,1.3271,1.2015,0.0984,2.5358,0.4118,0.5848,4.0162,0.023,2.9088,0.0042,1.7688,0.6991,5.5328,2.7921,0.2005,0.0233,8.055,2.3308,3.0011,1.2477,4.1714,7.4927,3.8969,3.8748,2.7122,3.8375,5.5816,2.3285,1.3867,2.2029,4.5516,1.0123,1.1121,2.131,1.6209,2.0925,5.7439,3.5613,0.5602,2.3741,1.6248,4.6055,1.9363,2.7941,0.0708,1.7984,4.1699,4.928,1.8418,5.4626,3.5212,6.7219,1.4427,4.013,7.6549,1.021,5.9564,5.2216,3.6072,4.1436,3.1837,1.8525,9.2304,1.5776,4.1355,3.3665,0.02,0.2336,0.5664,0.8884,6.3146,1.9853,4.9379,0.047,5.2388,2.2841,5.5077,5.8414,5.098,0.8717,1.0804,16.5751,7.1393,3.5181,0.6061,4.5634,2.5451,5.2811,3.2291,0.0218,0.081,1.6729,0.0015,4.0235,6.6867,0.0226,2.5921,0.2654,3.6527,2.3835,3.7786,0.2709,2.0133,3.7125,1.7802,4.8602,2.4571,0.011,8.4678,5.7815,3.8616,1.715,2.5507,5.5625,2.5108,4.6305,3.887,0.0647,2.2032,3.4762,3.1676,0.9621,7.056,2.296,4.0764,2.0261,4.7478,4.8502,1.6371,5.755,7.4148,1.112,1.7902,3.6975,0.138,0.4417,4.8041,1.6198,1.1356,0.0035,4.0774,2.3851,3.118,6.6487,0.0121,5.3473,5.6125,0.4919,0.8161,3.265,6.5857,0.4397,1.802,0.0084,4.8153,0.026,0.348,2.1378,0.3555,9.3685,2.0392,1.5394,3.917,1.3603,5.9017,0.0301,0.8793,2.3685,8.4627,2.888,1.3239,0.0886,0.0509,1.8594,4.5563,5.049,0.8731,3.7759,0.9121,0.0458,0.898,2.3682,3.5236,2.2322,1.5928,7.0698,3.3061,1.8866,2.0941,0.0505,1.6494,2.4276,0.3247,0.7999,1.5313,1.2914,1.6326,5.0415,1.2639,3.5928,4.5181,0.3336,0.4127,0.0129,2.5777,1.439,2.522,2.2772,3.9863,0.0922,3.1802,2.6416,3.5975,5.8369,3.6145,3.6791,0.1861,5.5277,2.0962,0.7939,5.5211,2.2404,7.2317,3.8616,4.9905,0.9235,2.6879,9.3513,1.1142,1.8594,2.525,3.8956,3.3096,0.4236,6.9583,2.2668,0.6347,5.7018,0.2769,3.8828,0.5046,2.5612,5.8035,5.6393,3.2874,0.9763,3.5592,4.7326,3.8297,0.9348,0.6872,2.197,2.6213,3.187,3.6156,0.7629,3.3092,2.0642,1.2357,2.5938,0.0472,6.3821,0.8856,1.8044,6.2257,2.7006,0.3705,7.8934,1.7364,3.3211,4.6154,4.1206,1.6162,4.8644,1.1,0.8346,0.0984,0.0483,0.0059,0.0343,0.5487,1.4704,8.1824,1.4901,4.6527,2.8507,1.2354,4.3732,3.2776,1.2247,2.1588,6.7853,7.6528,0.7878,0.6084,4.3522,0.2381,0.2621,2.7787,3.5705,0.0336,0.0665,0.0689,1.5938,3.7947,2.2873,5.0044,4.4589,1.7948,1.8337,0.8829,3.2466,1.8427,5.6737,4.4967,0.0541,0.0267,0.0842,3.643,3.6491,4.4201,2.3667,1.7314,0.4091,4.7031,8.4799,5.4229,4.5919,2.7524,1.9552,3.0954,3.3373,0.0205,1.1408,2.2741,3.5684,0.9358,3.2211,4.0618,1.5057,5.5383,5.8838,0.3902,5.1496,0.4843,1.3265,6.3675,6.3896,2.5851,7.1788,3.0829,2.6321,6.0368,2.7831,7.6221,0.2085,1.3013]}

The station itself was designated as'Depot'in May 1921 when it became a depot under RAF Area Command Uxbridge.\nA detachment was assigned to the base as a separate unit of No. 1 Detachment, RAF Depot Halton ( Fighter) for fighter formation ( Fighter Station RAF Uxbridge (FSRU) ) between October 1921 and November 1953, later becoming a fighter squadron of No. 1 Fighter Squadron, RAF Uxbridge.\nIn November 1953 the base was withdrawn from RAF Depot R.C., becoming a fighter training establishment of a depot squadron of the RAF.\nIt assumed the role of an aerial station during the Korean War and became an international fighter training base.\nThe airstrip at Uxbridge was re-assigned to No. 1 Fighter Unit on 3 January 1964.\nAs a result of closure of the Royal Canadian Air Force base at Halton, the Uxbridge airstrip, was placed into RAF station status, and was renamed, RAF Uxbridge, Ontario on the 30 June 1964 and RAF Station Uxbridge on 28 August 1964.\nFurther, on 8 December 1964, RAF Uxbridge was separated from No. 7 (Training) Group. RAF Uxbridge had been serving as a temporary airfield location in the United Kingdom since October 1963, when the new aircraft at Halton had been grounded.\nSince 31 January 1965, the aircraft park at Halton had been closed officially. RAF ROC (Aircraft & Logistics), based at York, Yorkshire, with which Uxbridge had a close relationship, and had been part of No. 7 Group, from its formation in September 1944, was chosen as the new aviation base for Halton, on the grounds that York could take over the responsibilities of Halton's existing U.K. logistical network.\nThe Aircraft Movement & Handling area at Uxbridge, with its fleet of former Aircraft Rest Station Cessna's, and the No. 7 Group Aircraft Maintenance Depot (ARMDEPT) at Halton, were moved to York on 25 November 1964.   The former Aircraft Handling area was transferred to RAF Leeds\/Holyhead, and RAF Uxbridge, Ontario itself was removed from RAF depot status on a permanent basis on 10 January 1965.\n\nRecent history\n\nThe Uxbridge Airfield now forms part of a large mixed-use development, the Uxbridge Quarter (Uxbridge North Park), being the northern part of the site being designated Uxbridge Town Centre.","token_len":545,"entropy":[10.5355,4.0825,7.812,8.7309,3.8744,4.2285,7.7714,0.3435,1.4369,6.7334,8.8334,6.7445,3.0738,7.8357,1.7187,5.6454,1.3326,6.4545,6.7532,2.0928,10.8165,3.617,0.8521,8.2288,0.4598,2.5437,5.4407,2.6094,4.2168,7.2918,3.3207,0.027,0.9886,1.6513,7.1236,5.6684,0.6321,5.1795,1.8586,11.5032,6.7143,0.7501,3.2311,5.4447,5.0851,3.9941,4.6313,1.0268,2.2911,2.5141,2.9316,4.7123,3.401,9.906,2.4936,8.5785,0.2989,0.0108,0.7729,1.9121,6.4394,4.6647,3.6937,2.8867,0.1694,1.5842,4.6536,3.3952,2.4234,4.5037,1.8546,3.6318,4.9673,0.0305,0.6851,6.3614,0.0136,1.9003,1.3567,5.2622,7.3307,0.0005,3.2434,13.4453,5.2428,3.5793,8.8204,6.4643,4.3015,5.1151,8.5113,5.8224,3.0393,0.0235,0.0018,5.0293,7.843,3.3556,3.4781,0.8248,2.6608,5.3058,3.7344,2.2459,0.1016,2.3575,8.0386,1.839,5.4486,4.0908,2.1326,5.0766,2.8765,2.97,0.9457,0.0034,0.5716,4.7653,1.4426,1.7417,0.2537,1.6061,0.0043,0.0012,1.9324,1.1247,3.0597,2.9131,1.6007,1.729,2.3895,0.5387,5.6563,0.8297,0.8585,2.3554,6.5353,4.8191,3.0625,3.8998,6.3897,1.4234,3.2769,4.4617,8.6557,3.1494,5.214,5.6571,6.5431,1.6628,2.8898,1.3543,3.2871,0.8144,4.7098,9.037,0.9985,2.4493,0.0663,3.8528,4.95,3.4656,4.4767,0.5867,3.9056,0.0656,1.7352,2.7626,2.7019,5.5935,3.6586,1.135,1.0764,1.4561,0.9758,1.783,8.0064,0.1626,2.8676,3.0563,0.0397,0.0021,0.9326,5.371,0.2838,4.6686,0.0587,0.3229,2.449,0.0072,0.929,3.8283,5.5262,4.353,4.1815,2.7531,3.1389,1.2127,0.7689,4.6387,1.8528,1.834,0.2569,7.8544,0.7533,0.7989,7.8866,4.2301,0.1334,0.0481,1.936,0.8475,3.5336,0.0015,0.9478,1.1922,4.8765,0.1049,0.0017,2.9344,0.02,3.7142,6.4712,4.7892,2.7542,5.2304,6.9156,5.8288,2.4677,2.6173,2.2263,2.352,4.2252,2.6862,2.7267,0.0104,0.009,2.1249,11.8395,3.243,4.8029,3.718,3.2827,1.6079,4.0346,0.7308,4.5626,1.8887,0.0109,0.0022,1.3612,3.6619,2.0985,0.5219,0.3382,0.436,6.5512,4.8074,2.9124,3.3683,2.5195,1.2856,0.8273,2.0888,2.104,0.0042,0.001,1.1007,7.3838,0.0626,1.7512,0.0032,6.3027,4.6405,7.64,3.1284,4.0839,4.2025,2.9958,1.0495,0.0034,0.0008,3.6833,1.0979,6.797,1.3077,0.936,5.3135,3.3996,1.2203,7.6943,2.8681,1.0616,4.0915,0.3543,1.8925,4.3298,4.0469,1.3985,2.2178,1.4209,5.2128,3.698,6.3559,2.4531,0.0018,4.4846,0.7529,4.7505,1.0232,0.5639,5.368,7.0786,2.3577,1.5605,0.4935,1.3615,3.265,9.0848,0.8197,1.2975,0.0016,2.4816,0.325,2.2761,8.2391,1.7116,3.4247,5.4098,8.4639,4.2685,6.2775,0.3472,6.1799,5.1613,0.1725,5.2023,5.0497,0.2973,6.9487,0.7379,6.2106,0.3018,5.8398,6.2903,4.1618,0.0056,0.0003,1.1757,3.4657,4.1747,1.0912,0.5217,4.0214,6.1068,1.4551,4.2946,0.0247,5.9877,0.0051,2.3625,4.1841,1.7259,6.0442,5.7372,5.4946,1.1764,2.8632,4.5737,1.1977,1.375,7.0981,0.8519,0.8482,2.8477,7.27,0.3903,1.524,3.5928,0.0012,2.0286,4.4411,0.9683,3.1809,0.2417,10.6613,4.8191,4.971,2.6384,0.8935,7.4489,0.4545,3.9105,0.001,2.7675,4.5798,5.7762,3.5138,0.559,0.1059,8.9439,6.4273,0.7201,0.3952,1.7041,6.4115,10.092,5.0073,8.1732,7.2183,1.4996,1.5731,0.0026,0.0003,2.0896,3.8581,1.799,7.9336,0.1309,8.0657,5.9603,7.4538,8.132,5.4813,2.5188,0.637,5.0598,0.9986,3.5005,1.7897,6.2555,0.0629,1.5809,1.4325,3.8518,3.4166,3.1019,2.0314,7.7649,7.2158,11.3919,0.7321,1.753,1.3849,0.0016,0.6295,2.5828,4.0981,0.5294,9.3146,1.9845,3.6889,2.5641,2.0696,0.7537,8.4743,5.4192,3.5595,5.258,3.4282,5.5782,5.1066,1.2695,3.9554,0.1788,2.252,9.9139,6.7498,8.7916,1.88,1.9041,2.1658,2.9222,3.0207,0.0167,0.0009,2.6309,1.9438,10.0309,1.0142,4.2997,0.5453,0.8001,3.5855,0.1918,2.3314,7.4936,3.694,0.0193,2.5809,3.6886,1.8604,0.7956,0.2881,0.4615,6.5837,8.0998,3.4389,0.816,0.3813,1.6573,3.0655,0.0514,0.0017,3.6028,0.8866,6.5292,6.5647,0.2527,0.0014,2.9801,3.2786,7.6902,1.462,0.2118,1.9502,2.5727,3.1824,2.8553,0.0518,0.0115,7.5643,3.5413,2.8767,1.7372,0.0711,6.9397,5.4097,2.1024,4.6412,1.8136,4.9482,3.036,0.0116,0.4957,2.9256,4.8292,4.7309,3.7218,0.0368,0.0093,5.5222,2.4044,1.3745]}

The other two are : sy\u0101dv\u0101da \u2014 the theory of conditioned predication and ; nayav\u0101da \u2014 the theory of dualism. [1]\nThe school of anek\u0101ntav\u0101dais also called the Taim\u012bs is well distinguished in the Indian history. It is usually included under the name of Jainism and considered as Jaina philosophy. [2]\nThe system of Anek\u0101ntav\u0101da or theory was formed by \u015aa\u1e45gava Muni (c. 560\u2013c. 530 BC) at Samudragiri in north-western India. He was not the first of his type. It seems that there was no teacher before him named \u015aa\u1e47\u1e0daka, but after him many other teachers appeared with various names, but sharing in the same philosophy. [2]\nMany of his disciples came to a belief in the theory of relativity following the development of his system. Among others his sons were:\n\u015ar\u012bdhara \u2013 The leader of the anek\u0101ntav\u0101d\u012bs who took charge upon him after the death of \u015aa\u1e45gava Muni.\nR\u016bpaka and Vasudha \u2013 The two teachers who became the most prominent among the anek\u0101ntav\u0101d\u012bs. His first son was said to resemble R\u016bpaka the saint of Bharata Muni, while his second son, Vasudha, resembled S\u0101taya Muni. Another daughter became a sister of R\u016bpaka. They were noted as great commentators on the scriptures and their names would appear among the commentators of the Bhagavad g\u012bt\u0101 (Srimad Bhagavatam 8.22.41\u201342).\nArya Kaly\u0101\u1e47\u012bya (Arya = great, Kaly\u0101\u1e47\u012bya = a commentator on the Bhagavad g\u012bt\u0101) \u2013 Kaly\u0101\u1e47\u012b was of the same lineage as \u015ar\u012bdhara and R\u016bpaka and was a great commentator on the Upani\u1e63ads. At a later time he developed a view which was different from other anek\u0101ntav\u0101d\u012bs which is called a view of no dualism. This view has not yet been found among the original anek\u0101ntav\u0101d\u012bs, but has been developed by later commentators on the Upani\u1e63ads.

After several minutes of running and being unable to gain the advantage at first, Katara freezes Azula and chains her to the ground. Toph's mask gets broken and she says there isn't a single soul here. At this point, she runs away from the village crying. Katara's mask gets better as she pulls herself up. It ends with Katara crying into her mask as she runs off. Azula appears and looks at Zuko and the others. There are some shots of her and Azula looking at each other and it seems like she's going to say something. Zuko runs and hugs his mother. Later on, we see Asami crying looking at the ground as she hugs herself. A shot with Zuko getting up and crying in the corner of the room.\nA shot shows Zuko and everyone running away from both Azula and the village with the camera pointing left to right, so we can see most of the characters. Katara and Zuko run past a giant statue of the Avatar. We see Zuko trying to take his mask off and seeing the Avatar in the bottom of it as Katara hugs him. After they run past the statue, we see the Avatar staring up at Zuko and Katara looking at the statue. Zuko goes to get his mask back and gives it to Katara, and says to take back the mask she gave him. A shot from the ground shows the fight for Azula coming to a stop for a couple of seconds before Azula gets up and starts running. Zuko says goodnight to everyone then gets his mask back.\nAzula then leaves. A shot shows Zuko and Katara looking at the statue and crying at the same time. We see a shot of them running to the river, with the same camera as before. There we see him run past the statue, take off his mask and put it back on. He then cries and wipes away his tears. The shot is taken from Zuko's point of view, looking back at the statue.\nKatara takes off her mask and starts walking, crying and looking at the Avatar in the bottom. We see Zuko looking in her direction. A shot of Zuko looking back at the river and Azula running after him. A shot of the Avatar on the river. The shots are taken from Katara's point of view, from the bottom of the statue to the stream.\nZuko takes his mask off and it starts raining. We see him sitting down and taking his coat that is covered in blood off his head. He looks at Katara and hugs him.","token_len":546,"entropy":[10.7193,9.8904,2.2659,0.6069,1.0914,8.352,0.1777,2.8636,8.7679,0.2119,3.2218,6.5744,0.1628,4.8102,1.714,4.552,4.3264,1.2268,1.0921,5.4324,2.924,5.4591,4.4589,0.0008,6.2724,2.719,5.1175,5.7362,3.2789,0.2002,1.508,0.0037,8.0684,4.3949,0.0001,1.4887,8.3633,0.6199,1.2763,0.3367,0.2624,0.7752,7.0344,4.2812,4.0174,5.8891,5.5376,4.1972,1.101,1.0955,5.5808,5.3207,4.0995,0.0005,2.4185,2.9168,5.1441,4.7779,0.662,5.5874,1.1988,0.4302,0.5528,2.6622,4.7804,2.223,1.2179,1.0844,5.455,7.4263,1.3075,3.1663,0.0083,4.4441,3.5805,2.2598,6.347,2.2888,0.47,6.2764,3.259,1.3484,2.5752,4.6178,6.2752,3.5441,3.085,0.0062,3.8618,5.234,1.4957,2.7775,2.4528,1.2555,3.1557,2.4882,0.5964,2.995,0.0003,4.5615,1.3224,4.5237,1.0411,5.1063,0.0016,2.1075,3.8063,1.0615,0.6655,5.7921,1.4457,3.0476,6.4893,0.2405,2.6324,2.0193,1.3074,0.0012,4.16,0.8142,1.0678,0.0268,2.3599,5.1621,1.8229,1.3114,1.3244,1.4529,3.9205,0.3183,3.8486,0.2403,1.4855,1.74,0.0002,5.3347,3.7005,5.7766,3.7325,2.9614,0.8577,5.8999,1.7995,0.3782,5.0293,0.5399,8.1328,0.1837,4.3193,7.8058,0.5485,2.1053,2.6778,2.846,0.9932,5.0877,5.5795,0.575,4.6491,4.5975,6.4709,2.4047,0.001,6.3188,2.1525,1.3904,3.7468,3.6001,1.6084,4.0587,1.2863,0.345,0.4088,0.9449,2.1842,6.665,2.1469,7.3472,2.0125,0.0005,1.9739,6.5662,3.0713,2.3895,0.8922,8.0321,3.5568,0.0263,0.0645,2.9201,1.4564,4.2063,2.3777,4.7587,4.4947,6.2333,3.5218,1.6479,3.2605,4.6552,1.7265,0.6634,0.1535,7.1639,0.0498,0.5677,4.1951,1.9338,3.923,0.0185,1.9317,3.2074,0.001,3.1514,3.9179,3.0696,5.3272,2.2715,0.7412,2.3653,3.946,1.584,3.5436,0.6222,2.3409,0.0009,5.0191,0.0487,4.1539,2.9628,2.0375,0.5497,1.8798,4.8566,2.078,3.5469,3.193,1.3648,6.2154,1.5375,3.5624,3.8313,5.1436,0.0036,6.331,0.62,0.4348,4.2081,3.6646,2.5786,2.599,0.8509,0.2905,0.4486,1.6922,0.1867,2.2364,1.6082,6.2726,3.6859,0.1564,2.1964,0.0007,1.8245,3.6953,0.0048,4.1193,0.6133,1.8103,2.1588,0.7797,1.6502,0.0006,4.2508,1.2658,3.2589,1.1534,0.6619,1.2397,0.9879,5.4233,0.841,0.2785,1.234,0.0017,2.098,3.2573,4.3664,3.2777,3.5392,5.0083,1.7095,0.7344,4.9545,1.9917,0.3299,0.6746,4.7456,0.9087,2.6357,1.0996,4.322,1.0833,1.7236,8.2019,4.9409,2.3524,0.0042,5.051,1.4123,3.0065,1.4027,5.6411,1.4497,5.3166,0.726,0.7335,1.3974,3.1084,0.0012,3.7255,0.904,0.4066,2.9232,1.4809,1.2102,1.7207,0.0009,3.4207,7.1978,2.3309,1.8724,2.3066,5.5284,4.2502,4.8445,0.4956,0.1186,1.2253,1.1033,3.743,0.0057,4.1978,4.0135,2.5899,4.2206,0.7623,1.3774,1.397,0.0006,1.2088,2.0632,0.0079,2.3685,0.2978,1.4351,1.8127,2.1712,6.2921,3.5617,0.6865,1.1444,0.0186,0.302,2.7571,0.5059,3.2023,1.7765,0.3761,3.9978,1.9074,2.6169,1.0974,3.6776,2.9254,3.577,2.196,5.2435,2.5453,3.7314,1.0834,0.3601,4.1963,5.6737,0.1222,6.737,4.798,3.1353,1.1215,0.3885,2.0994,8.215,3.6021,0.1098,0.1667,0.6807,4.9259,0.5414,0.56,0.3035,0.3417,2.8814,1.3655,5.7365,2.0993,7.3213,2.6185,1.9119,0.0355,0.6214,2.9137,3.3711,3.0392,3.1494,1.8439,3.6657,0.0024,0.977,4.59,0.0838,0.0098,2.1944,4.9756,2.8438,0.49,0.8962,0.6371,0.7553,1.1513,4.3325,0.0141,4.8166,1.7676,0.1539,0.2447,0.612,3.3821,2.7512,3.8063,4.9538,2.2011,2.1572,1.0959,0.5376,4.0631,2.394,0.2565,0.7084,3.9673,2.908,0.2331,1.5702,0.0007,3.2061,4.7492,4.1491,2.0085,1.6388,3.2651,0.1739,1.3732,1.5047,0.0007,2.5385,3.061,0.289,0.7929,6.9192,1.6205,5.3878,0.003,2.1962,3.6466,0.5894,0.4183,2.6838,0.169,0.6286,1.9884,1.5918,4.5659,0.7445,1.2819,1.7699,2.9108,4.3364,1.5677,1.2287,0.4357,3.9179,0.0147,0.5094,1.0965,0.0402,0.001,1.3549,5.5716,1.2851,2.3932,0.2867,0.3647,1.0192,2.4023,0.4401,6.2727,0.6666,0.9257,1.0825,0.0044,4.2754,1.6781,0.2206,0.5731,0.506,6.2417,3.2797,4.3455,0.9125,2.1857,0.1484,3.3372,5.9468,2.7335,2.2674,4.3013,0.8823,6.0881,8.0309,2.4113,3.9796,0.7827,1.1495,4.8829,2.3853,2.3935,0.4116,1.5176,1.826,0.9755,2.1899,0.0044,0.9917,8.0612,3.2649,0.4126]}

The map image was created using ImageJ in the software platform Java. 1 It displays the area of a selected region of < unk >. A high-resolution image is displayed in the same window.\nFigure 4\n< unk > area map for the dwarf planet Ceres. Image generated using the ImageJ software platform (ImageJ). The region Ceres 1 has a size of 40 by 40 pixels (or a spatial resolution of 3.6 m).\nConclusions -Future work\nWe created a list of the first 10,000 names of new craters of the International Astronomical Union's Crater Catalogue. We obtained it by combining the data with the images of the corresponding Crater Explorer and Crater Watcher Crater Sites. Using the images of the Crater Explorer and Crater Watcher, together with the IAU database, we have created a web tool called CraterExplorer -a website to search for new craters around the world. The map below shows an example. It shows the area of the crater < unk > located in the dwarf planet Ceres. A high-resolution image of the same region is displayed in the same window. The maps show that the information contained in the Crater Catalogue can be applied to locate new craters on the planet for study.\nWe have implemented a feature that we added in the latest versions of the Crater Explorer tool, which displays (on a map) the locations of all crater < unk > on the map. This feature is useful for determining the locations of the craters that are unknown because the information is displayed on the map, together with a digital picture of the corresponding region.\nWe created a Crater Explorer map showing the area of the dwarf planet Ceres (Figure 4). The region displayed in the image has a size of 40 by 40 pixels. This size was chosen because it is larger than the spatial resolution (3.6 m) of the low-resolution image. The images displayed in the map were obtained from < unk > areas on the Ceres map. Our future plan is to create maps of the entire Crater Explorer Crater Atlas.\nWe plan to create a Crater Explorer map that shows all Ceres craters with diameters greater than 2 km. The goal is to create a web map displaying all craters that are geologically active. We also plan to expand Crater Explorer by developing a Crater Explorer web application (Crater Explorer App) and create a separate Crater Explorer iPhone and iPad app.","token_len":547,"entropy":[7.2906,11.7043,10.9424,6.5849,5.2523,5.9828,1.2338,12.2091,5.9441,4.3348,1.577,7.4329,0.1786,6.7338,5.5741,1.6887,2.0693,1.4116,4.4176,0.6205,5.4834,0.8118,0.6143,4.338,8.6854,0.0413,6.7573,4.564,4.5489,7.3102,2.7077,6.206,3.3073,5.8127,3.8136,0.8716,1.6295,6.8867,7.605,3.1519,1.5447,1.2408,6.3006,2.9941,3.884,3.1433,5.2902,5.4705,6.5343,1.415,6.1132,7.074,6.7135,0.6718,5.1382,0.8003,3.4858,7.4457,3.1259,1.5574,7.3961,2.7235,0.0024,0.0623,3.6161,4.7803,5.663,1.7624,0.136,1.6728,1.4379,2.3106,2.4365,0.6564,4.3808,3.3432,0.8765,2.5578,11.3127,2.3756,3.459,5.6517,0.3946,0.0011,0.0163,7.8345,4.267,2.6295,1.6045,1.6553,0.0338,0.0265,1.1636,3.7713,5.968,0.8867,2.4378,2.2883,0.0325,1.2945,0.349,3.3167,4.1614,0.2258,3.8793,2.0208,3.9002,11.9469,7.9522,3.2827,2.0846,5.3583,0.2292,5.0576,6.0367,1.9032,2.8794,2.4479,5.212,3.9225,8.0101,0.6699,0.0753,3.3258,1.0565,2.6964,3.3607,1.7136,2.6121,6.9748,0.3533,5.7584,13.2802,3.6323,2.9056,2.4497,6.7378,0.8107,5.3592,0.0461,2.3378,5.1531,3.2505,3.3035,0.1786,7.0272,0.9827,6.128,2.696,0.0023,3.7332,0.8137,9.0111,2.0299,0.0047,0.0005,1.8427,5.5192,0.083,6.3677,0.0016,2.0548,1.6458,6.2865,7.2203,1.6285,2.5743,1.1783,2.606,3.4861,1.2361,5.05,1.4182,0.9653,6.126,6.1549,0.1138,4.5912,3.0007,2.6156,0.0339,7.2662,0.2058,7.3185,1.2576,5.1902,1.3444,4.9686,1.0811,3.3738,2.0223,0.7028,3.6374,0.0735,0.1187,0.5238,0.5532,0.0009,0.0074,0.0036,3.2452,6.6995,0.0932,0.613,4.4604,0.0126,4.7633,0.9896,0.1103,3.3071,3.32,0.4295,7.3513,5.4448,4.3122,3.2487,0.0554,5.7952,0.0298,5.0573,3.6759,5.2842,1.8854,2.6064,0.3977,0.8583,0.77,0.0047,5.1429,0.2839,0.5457,0.2487,2.0206,6.0299,2.9192,0.6621,4.1723,2.2174,4.4041,2.78,1.0563,0.9099,2.3851,0.3001,1.1726,5.3321,5.5342,0.4412,0.0007,0.0229,5.2595,1.2794,0.7176,5.6105,0.113,0.1969,0.9589,4.2278,0.8603,0.5259,0.0261,0.313,1.2814,0.4003,4.9731,1.0921,0.7442,0.5187,0.6904,0.1163,0.0315,0.0141,0.099,1.8418,5.9781,3.3879,3.0019,0.8317,7.1669,3.6619,0.2994,0.4881,4.6887,0.0108,12.6053,0.0019,3.4708,0.1988,4.2295,0.261,8.4488,0.9065,0.4815,0.0018,3.6742,1.0089,2.2386,6.1086,4.3293,0.7038,1.3892,2.8978,1.8696,5.736,1.1172,4.7471,2.1511,4.0947,6.7535,1.4665,1.2582,3.6152,3.9716,0.0334,0.5765,2.3667,0.0094,0.0295,4.1992,2.1799,1.0431,5.3922,7.5993,5.035,1.3276,3.3875,0.5586,0.5771,3.0504,0.1913,2.5596,6.4254,5.81,0.0861,0.0028,0.0098,2.8379,0.3022,4.6683,0.5183,1.83,0.4685,1.4097,3.0683,0.7564,3.6033,0.9297,3.0085,0.0939,2.3509,2.0175,0.0035,2.5727,1.0123,5.9129,4.8844,2.0896,2.7182,1.8473,6.8248,1.7432,0.8845,1.0785,2.7573,7.2392,0.001,2.9911,7.359,5.6882,0.491,0.2902,4.9556,2.7691,0.7677,1.4295,1.8676,4.3835,0.5551,7.5182,0.0085,0.1017,3.9428,3.9876,0.519,3.1021,0.2455,0.4973,2.2701,0.011,0.0899,3.6217,3.1618,1.5623,0.4225,1.2141,3.7213,7.1973,1.1887,0.3445,2.5127,3.7664,0.5122,0.6701,0.0439,1.1991,0.1561,0.0042,0.0089,1.562,2.8868,3.8913,3.8257,1.3054,1.1917,1.0214,0.9569,4.4001,0.1499,0.3272,7.2515,0.0554,4.2846,1.2272,0.054,0.1286,0.1766,0.8861,0.6191,0.3016,7.4717,0.6625,0.0605,1.308,1.3585,1.3717,4.2635,4.132,0.9977,0.3713,2.0548,2.7533,3.3224,1.1458,5.3058,0.3306,0.0013,0.0134,6.1705,2.8137,0.3928,4.7294,2.57,0.8916,4.6819,8.2003,3.145,0.3982,0.0375,2.8137,5.0337,1.3045,1.2798,3.184,5.3332,0.0077,0.0678,5.2951,0.0101,5.8644,2.0924,1.3333,2.3432,4.3754,0.0659,2.9013,0.7368,3.9864,0.0029,0.7057,1.3663,2.5389,1.2674,2.312,8.8719,2.2015,0.0051,3.2422,8.948,0.0041,3.1967,0.0437,4.0092,1.4964,1.2788,1.4395,6.8478,0.5027,0.119,2.6492,0.5259,5.2806,2.6677,5.6841,1.4337,2.1092,0.008,2.4307,0.5272,7.2364,0.2979,3.3391,1.8452,2.1212,2.8017,0.3685,0.0368,5.5882,4.1063,0.0042,0.0876,3.1215,5.3233,1.3145,5.4505,0.0039,0.9359,3.3071,3.1656,3.5495,4.0416,0.127,0.7659,5.0476,1.1281,2.6459,6.53,0.5859,5.4559,2.382,0.0023,0.1522,8.7928,4.9524,0.1929,0.4178,1.0672]}

Shortly after it had aired, the Simpsons staff received over 100 letters from angry Australians. A few weeks following it premiering, the ABC ceased airing any versions of the series to its Australian viewers, stating that only the U.S.\nversion airs in Australia. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, producer Al Jean said he felt the episode was meant to show just how bad a great country Australia has become.\nThe following day, the series aired in Australia and it received mostly positive reviews from viewers. In, Australian fans of the series formed a Facebook Group for Australians who wanted Simpsons in Australia. Following this, The Simpsons also began airing a one-season stand-up special to mark the release of the episode. Most of The Simpsons episodes in Australia and New Zealand are broadcast as part of the weekend repeats at the middle of the night. In the United Kingdom, the episodes air in the Sunday afternoons at the start of the channel ABC. The episodes originally aired with subtitles, but in September, following a high demand for subtitles during the U.S.\nreplacement of The Simpsons on Fox, the episode The Movie was dubbed for the Fox network. The Simpsons has never aired on the Canadian channel TBS, although it has regularly aired in Australia on Fox and Network Ten. It is broadcast locally as part of reruns on Network Ten and Network Nine.\nIn Germany, the episodes originally aired with German language subtitles. The German rights-holder RTL bought the Simpsons for an undisclosed fee in order to sell them more quickly; during the negotiations, the Simpsons were being aired in Germany on a daily basis.\nIn Canada, the episodes are broadcast on the day after they occur on Fox. After several years, in late October, the episodes began airing on Mondays at the earliest.\nIn Finland, the episodes air on VH1 on a daily basis, with the exception of shows from January 1, February 1, and March 1, which instead air weekly on the days after they occur on Fox, due to the Christmas and New Year's holiday periods. The episodes originally aired in this country without subtitles on the same format as they aired on Fox, but the first few seasons now appear in Finnish.\nIn France, the episodes originally aired both without and with subtitles in their version of the show. In Italy, the episodes originally aired with the Italian voice actors on the day they occurred.\nIn Hungary, Finland, Latvia, and Slovakia, the episodes previously aired with both dubbed and closed captioned versions.

Three battalions of the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade","text":"The T12 \/ M3 GMC first saw action with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in 1941 \u2013 42, six months after it was designed. Three battalions of the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade were equipped with the T12. A full strength T18 GMC battalion would have probably replaced the T12 in the Philippines, but the battalion was lost during the war.\nBy mid-1942 the T12 \/ M3 was in service in the Philippines with two battalions in the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade (PFAB) equipped with either the M1A2 or the T12 \/ M3. During the latter part of 1942 and 1943 the unit were involved in Operation Tango where the Japanese were driven to their last defense of the Philippines. In addition to the PFAB the unit was present in the Philippines in May 1943 as part of Operation Torch where they participated in the battles of Leyte.\nThe GMC T12 is used around the world by various militaries as the basic assault gun mount. In the U.S. it is used in the field weapons systems of many service branches of the US Army, as well as the Naval Air Force and the Air Force\u2019s heavy artillery.\nIn 1942, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps began equipping M1A2G and M3 GMCs with the M60C 122 mm (4.7-in) gun, which was used in the early phases of the Philippine\u2013American War, and later served as the standard assault weapon across the world during World War II. The M60C\u2019s superior handling characteristics meant that the gun was the only field gun capable of operating against a swarm of enemy aircraft, and the use of the M1A2\u2019s superior penetration capability and the M3\u2019s capability to operate at higher velocities made the M1A2M3\/M60 the most versatile ground assault weapons in the world.\nA GMC\u2019s gun and the mounting are called a Tack.

It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a similar style to one at Southwell, being topped by a stone gargoyle which bears the legend \u201c From this height I see the beauty of the surrounding country in the days of good weather. \u201d The church, which is dedicated to the Lady of Sudeley, was built in the late fifteenth century during the reign of Henry VII, is a large building with a low tower.\nAn interesting monument in the churchyard is that to a Roman Catholic family who were exterminated by Henry VIII and Queen Katherine Parr during the English Reformation. One of the martyrs is Henry Growling, who may have been the founder of Sudeley.\nSaddleworth Priory at Southwell was formerly in the Bishopric of Exeter, but now belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury. It was granted to Bishop Warburton of Exeter by the Domesday Book and was originally a religious house.\nThe priory was rebuilt in the fourteenth century and then enlarged in the fifteenth and in the seventeenth centuries, the last period being when the present high steeple rose to its present height. The present cloisters were built by the Prioress of Sudeley, Elizabeth Roper and they have arcades beneath which sheltered an ancient well with a spring in the basement.\nThe church, a fine piece of Norman masonry, has high piers and a nave having a square cross plan.\nThe tower has three bells and can be seen from a great distance.\nThe crypt, which is very rich, contains the sarcophagus of Sir Ralph Barker, 15th Marquess of Exeter.\nThe old prioryhouse, erected in the fifteenth century, now houses the library of the Sudeley Museum.\nThere is also a small chapel for the use of the members of the Sudeley family.\nThe priory church possesses a large collection of glass and stained glass windows of the old school type which were erected in the fourteenth, fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nThe church has fine works of painting by Roper, Thomas Blane and Thomas Albinus Groom.\nThere is also a fine brass of Henry Growling and several stained glass windows in the south

{"prompt":"On 27 December 2014 , it was announced that Torres ' move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015 , but two days later he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atl\u00e9tico","text":"On 27 December 2014, it was announced that Torres'move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015, but two days later he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on a two-year contract until June 2017. Prior to arriving at Atl\u00e9tico, Torres was released for a fee that was then rumored to be around $10 million.\n\nMilan\n\nTorres signed a one-year contract with AC Milan on 5 January 2015. On 18 September he made his debut in the club's Serie A opener with a goal in a 5\u20131 win over Chievo, and on 14 October scored his first European league goal against Sonderjyske in the group stage of the Europa League. He finished his first season on Milan's all-conquering way, becoming the highest goalscorer in the Serie A season with 22 goals.\nIn spite of his prolific season, which saw him bag 28 goals in all competitions, he didn't feature regularly for his new club on the second term. He scored his first goals for the club from open play against Inter on 2 December and Juventus four weeks later, but again struggled to secure a regular start in the January transfer transfer window, being replaced in midfield with Antonio Di Natale.\nOn 29 August 2016, Milan confirmed that Torres had signed a new contract until June 30, 2018.\n\nSpain\n\nOn 23 November 2014, Torres was called up for a European Championship under-21s squad. He was named captain of Spain under-21 and he was called up for its UEFA European Championship qualification group stage match against Sweden on 16 November.\nIn October 2016, Luis Enrique made a surprise call up for the Spain squad for the upcoming 2016 UEFA Nations League after ruling out Vicente Del Bosque. He was part of the Spanish squad for the tournament. On 20 October 2016, he was listed in Spain's preliminary 23-man side for their trip to Russia for UEFA Euro 2016. He was suspended for that match, although he later received a late red card on 28 October and was left out of the final squad.

{"prompt":"When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the portion of what is now NY 38 from Freeville to Moravia became part of NY 26 , a north","text":"When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of what is now NY 38 from Freeville to Moravia became part of NY 26, a north -south corridor linking the northern shore of the East River with Broadway, NY 26 served to connect the western part of Central Park with downtown Manhattan to Westchester County (see NY 26 route plan ). An interchange with New York State Route 23 at Moravia Avenue (formerly Moravia Boulevard) marked the start of the route's operation on July 1, 1925, it opened on the western end of the park. On October 31 of the same year, an interchange with New York State Route 2 south of Union Avenue in Freeville also connected the westward extension of NY 26 with NY 2.\nThe route continued its operation on a single track to Westchester, terminating at the now -defunct intersection of State Route 73 and Rt. 11A, near the former site of the Port of Freeville. NY 26 eventually extended a bit further west, meeting eastward -bound Rt. 11, now Rt. 11A in a shared approach from the east (see NY 26 route plan ).\nIn 1965 NY 26 was redesignated its current route, extending from Moravia to the Freeville Industrial Park. NY 26 was the only route in the New York City bus system to remain on its current two-lane alignment for as much as fifty years.\nIn the late 1950s, the route met two new routes, NY 2 and NY 3, at an intersection at Moravia Avenue just south of the Moravia interchange. NY 26 was not renumbered and operated independently from NY 2 and NY 3 until 1977, when it was placed under their patronage.\nDue to extensive improvements to NY 1, NY 2 and NY 3 in the mid-1980s, NY 26 was placed on a bypass, operating over the now -defunct NY 1 from Union Avenue in Freeville to the western end of Central Park. The bypass opened on March 29, 1985. In 1991 NY 26 was restored to service over the now -defunct NY 1 from Union Avenue in Freeville to a shared approach with NY 3 from the north near the Rt. 11A intersection, as the former NY 26 route was removed, along with all NY 1 and NY 3 service south of Union Avenue. NY 26 operated over that portion of NY 36 (from the Freeville bypass) as long as the NY 1 bypass was open.\nOn June 8, 1997, NY 26 reverted back to its original route, the present-day NY 26, and NY 3 was removed from the route. When NY 1 was rerouted the route was removed from the route on June 1, 2000.","token_len":553,"entropy":[2.5591,4.7426,5.9205,0.3527,12.4208,7.1993,4.3511,5.2635,0.5987,2.7314,6.8251,3.6683,6.6111,0.2621,1.4551,8.0961,0.4009,6.7503,1.7157,0.1528,6.4687,7.5019,4.7305,11.0635,4.9394,1.5443,8.4832,3.0565,4.0105,2.8904,0.0063,5.247,6.051,1.8805,3.5234,6.7048,9.2622,0.3532,2.91,4.7346,1.6818,5.5991,5.4112,0.8351,1.4373,5.2724,0.1381,0.8761,7.4627,2.0563,5.9897,2.6871,12.0367,3.3986,2.3366,1.2418,5.194,2.6291,0.0235,4.978,0.4738,1.2137,4.8029,1.4081,5.3153,5.5869,1.3667,1.7863,4.1641,3.7325,2.9605,1.0801,6.0903,6.2055,3.6546,6.5967,5.9279,2.748,3.3796,0.2959,2.4607,2.0207,4.8589,4.2999,5.1506,0.0265,4.4805,2.9562,4.7045,3.2384,0.4525,2.998,0.387,6.4849,0.526,3.1682,0.0662,0.7355,3.3843,2.8049,5.8713,3.7538,3.4992,1.8344,0.102,1.4992,1.3077,7.2222,3.7901,1.3948,2.9139,5.0142,1.3988,0.144,1.2657,3.9132,2.4879,3.838,2.7607,3.7605,4.4574,2.1786,0.1599,0.0069,0.2384,4.0889,1.1394,1.1144,1.9501,0.0175,0.1216,0.0088,4.9233,6.0854,0.3426,5.3439,1.3613,3.7422,5.2597,0.0185,5.7082,5.8985,0.9986,2.9066,5.9302,6.2093,0.1942,2.6261,0.5234,1.8714,4.8624,5.2779,2.0478,1.7763,3.9668,2.9127,4.4077,3.0986,2.3939,1.8012,4.5996,4.6933,2.8803,3.4551,4.3488,0.1467,4.1789,8.6605,0.8122,2.0166,6.997,6.8865,5.9775,0.0227,4.8368,0.1467,4.1425,1.0104,5.5709,1.331,6.7402,2.4568,0.2657,5.553,5.1454,2.2912,4.6885,1.5311,3.4849,3.5896,0.0391,0.9837,6.1228,1.5346,4.495,0.0452,0.8498,6.274,0.5801,5.7825,4.3946,5.1391,7.3523,1.1429,2.2143,1.8516,7.5403,5.923,3.1333,8.1171,6.2191,4.0763,0.0043,0.0137,0.6921,3.2846,5.7529,3.5979,0.0075,0.0107,1.2145,1.5254,4.0439,4.6765,8.8652,6.8773,3.91,1.5914,3.3181,3.5802,0.9179,1.2154,0.3521,0.6601,0.1073,0.4862,1.1476,3.0254,6.7204,5.3306,0.3819,1.4406,5.4716,0.0094,6.2413,2.8013,1.0777,1.793,6.0358,1.3052,4.7713,0.0116,1.3838,2.2698,6.9869,0.149,6.9541,1.0692,1.7388,3.7619,0.13,1.3773,3.6344,2.8495,2.0674,1.9266,0.7636,2.6963,0.0576,1.8408,7.2012,0.7388,0.7682,4.7799,2.7145,3.1483,0.6576,7.535,0.5497,2.2822,4.9722,2.6746,4.3339,3.7941,0.0878,6.303,0.4242,0.7197,1.3977,2.6255,2.6768,2.0546,2.1424,0.1183,1.0543,1.2463,2.6837,7.8657,4.7316,3.2069,4.3681,1.7569,3.1313,4.4402,0.2364,0.4701,2.5241,1.2819,4.046,4.346,0.7975,2.8433,3.9896,0.022,0.7644,6.157,1.3225,0.0056,1.5406,7.4555,0.0299,4.9222,0.7832,2.0413,3.9944,1.0745,4.3376,7.6878,0.0485,3.8915,4.6096,6.0296,2.515,1.9874,0.5864,2.9231,0.8662,0.0468,1.3279,4.2815,0.9689,0.3003,1.5142,0.5221,5.3005,2.2833,6.6457,7.9199,1.0354,1.1703,6.031,0.0276,6.5074,4.3318,1.5345,2.4175,4.813,1.5802,1.1912,0.5933,0.9584,0.2356,0.1017,2.5323,0.528,3.1157,0.2804,1.6037,0.0453,0.1506,1.5141,0.4021,0.8941,3.9714,2.3258,2.2983,9.7023,4.1764,6.2475,5.2707,1.0134,6.2904,1.0058,0.1264,0.0001,4.7444,2.7415,5.604,3.3657,0.29,2.2709,0.9367,0.0035,1.5704,1.1037,5.0329,0.2775,0.0177,1.7699,0.0049,0.5782,1.8852,2.8856,4.2414,1.0219,3.4908,3.7339,0.0426,2.4486,1.6345,3.3789,3.3549,2.5252,0.4987,0.6042,5.9021,0.3581,3.8088,5.6969,0.5291,2.9929,0.1731,0.0441,0.0,0.7628,0.6399,0.7168,0.5527,0.1078,1.0898,0.0977,0.0021,0.9123,4.0293,6.4102,0.7086,4.5043,2.6859,3.6902,2.9047,1.8813,3.757,6.3735,0.8286,5.336,0.0087,0.0054,0.6559,0.8746,1.8643,2.9201,4.2328,2.9152,3.0735,3.3379,2.3774,2.3144,1.4984,4.5392,4.466,3.9201,0.137,3.9667,4.8872,1.3199,1.5042,0.2768,1.8736,3.9291,6.9206,0.1486,1.4278,0.278,0.729,2.7655,0.3234,4.6932,3.4607,5.6895,3.9595,0.083,2.4811,9.0653,3.9963,3.6642,2.3669,5.7472,0.0138,7.1785,1.1757,3.4674,4.3876,0.0614,1.485,3.5163,1.2458,3.1089,0.9886,2.4616,1.0034,0.7517,2.7868,2.9872,3.4072,0.0591,3.1352,0.3319,1.3392,0.3263,8.0858,1.7061,0.0566,0.9293,0.8881,1.3273,1.3833,4.1208,6.3382,2.641,0.0086,1.8219,2.1239,2.0574,2.4657,3.7794,2.0414,2.3049,3.5979,0.5135,1.4086,2.7109,1.4474,5.8185,1.964,3.4309,0.7713,2.2799,1.0407,0.0016,5.1666,1.3299,1.1438,4.1543,0.5014,0.8128,1.7132,3.2688,2.2568,3.8297,0.1248,2.6583,0.9964]}

As with the previous year, he assisted in the MLS Cup championship, but did not manage the team to the postseason. The 2010 season was cut short before the club's tenth game of the season, due to Fowler's son, Jack, being born, with the club opting to wait until Fowler was back to train them up for the season ahead.\nIn February 2011 Fowler was fired from Oakland United, after his son had to be rushed to hospital due to complications caused by an ear infection.\n\nInternational career\n\nFowler won three caps for Australia at the 2009 FIFA World Cup. He started against Japan in the team's third group stage match.\n\nStyle of play\n\nFowler was known as a goalkeeper who could play on more than one side of the pitch. His speed was impressive and his vision was good. He could score goals from 30 metres out with both feet on the ball and was also known for his headers. In his early career during the 2005\u201306 season, Fowler did much of his own attacking work, due to his lack of physical strength.\n\nCoaching career\n\nIn September 2014, Fowler was appointed assistant manager at New York City, the MLS's best young club. In May 2015, he was promoted to assistant manager of the youth academy for the club.\nIn June 2015, he was named as the first assistant manager of the Premier League club AFC Bournemouth, a position he held until his resignation on 10 December 2015.\nIn September 2016, Fowler joined Australia's national under-21 football team as head coach.\nIn October 2017, Fowler was appointed assistant manager at the MLS club Minnesota United. He left the club in May 2018, to join AFC Bournemouth's academy team as a coach. In October 2018, Fowler was named the Australian men's assistant international team, succeeding Michael Maguire.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn February 2009 Fowler's wife and son Jack both suffered brain injuries in a car accident, but there were no physical injuries to their baby.

The 24-year-old finished with a 1, 10 victory @ 1, 11 loss against the St. Pauli and the Paderborn. The only game that he lost was the second match of the series. After having missed two weeks of the first matches due to an injury, he went to the first match on time.\nAt the beginning of March, the young right-handed pitcher was already training with the Boston Red Sox as an unpaid intern.\nAt this time, Humber received a salary of 500 \u20ac per month through Humber and the Boston Red Sox. He was able to perform a work permit and a travel permit before the European Baseball Championship. He played on March 4, 2010 on the left side of the mound ( 2 3 \u2013 win at home against Belgium) during the qualification of Germany for the 2010 World Baseball Championships in Japan.\nOn May 26, 2010, Germany faced Slovakia in a friendly game. The Tanyer pitched the ninth inning at the end and won with his fastball and a slider. The game was the only result of his first summer with the Red Sox.\nAfter spending three years with the Red Sox, Tanyer moved to the Philadelphia Eagles of the Major League Baseball's (MLB) American League.\nOn July 3, 2011, Tanyer was traded by the Eagles to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for two draft-years (2010 - 2011 ) of Andrew McCutchen. Later, his contract with the Orioles was ended. When he signed with the Cleveland Indians on July 31, 2011, the young left-hander was signed for a one-year contract.

{"prompt":"In the 9th century BC , the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Lebanon mountain range and its coastal cities . The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon , along with every other Phoenician city","text":"In the 9th century BC, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Lebanon mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other Phoenician city between Aleppo and Tyre, while at the same time pursuing and attacking them. According to Philonic and Jewish sources, Sidon was also conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c. 626\u2013669 BC); in order to ensure that the tribute payments were not made to the Babylonian generals and administrators but to the local kings, Sidon was granted autonomy. It probably was ruled as a separate colony by two kings named Hamulabi and Hamalish. Sidon was divided among families of Sidonian refugees from Canaan and Phoenician mercenaries who were given the title \"Khassu,\" which was ultimately absorbed by the name \"Cossu\" (Cossuite) in ancient literature. The people of Sion (also called Sidion or Sidiye) became known as the Cossuites. Later, Sidon was ruled by the Philistines, first under the Philistine king Jehu, and later under the Philistine king Jehoshaphat and the king of Jericho, Ahaz.\nSidon remained in Philistine hands until 587 BC. One of Jehoshaphat's successors, Hezekiah, led the city through a period of restoration, which resulted in a population boom that eventually exceeded 20,000. Around 600 BC, during the rule of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (586\u2013578 BC), the city's population declined again, and it was likely abandoned after Nebuchadnezzar's death, according to traditional sources. Some scholars date the destruction itself to the sixth century BC; in the 1950s, one of their hypotheses suggested that Sidon was destroyed in 606 BC during the reign of Nabonassar, who rebuilt Jerusalem and other cities of Judea in order to replace their previous inhabitants with new Jewish immigrants. The city was rebuilt on lower ground within the same strategic location and was probably connected with the ancient city by a road that passed through the site. It rebounded after the destruction, during which the city was known as Nabonazar (the Greek name for Sidon). The city continued to function as a commercial and trading center, and it became an important ally to the Babylonian empires during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar III (668\u2013627 BC), who built a wall protecting the city of Sidon from Jezreel and Ashdod. Nebuchadnezzar I made the city one of his trading posts along the coastal line.","token_len":554,"entropy":[2.6222,8.2867,0.8311,1.9909,3.3141,0.3457,1.7784,5.1967,0.3913,2.1349,5.1167,5.4158,4.0345,6.7485,9.8506,4.7189,2.8304,1.0343,8.9168,8.6119,1.0217,1.3619,5.4881,5.0995,3.4696,1.2065,2.0506,5.1563,8.6803,3.1867,11.8734,0.043,1.3338,0.9998,11.3474,0.0816,1.3312,6.4755,0.1939,7.2294,1.8563,9.9897,0.3306,0.0435,2.0003,8.0649,7.7404,0.1305,6.5153,0.0353,1.4684,3.9174,4.7187,0.305,0.0144,0.0014,6.8466,5.1627,5.5983,5.425,1.1558,5.9333,0.0012,7.3895,8.5167,4.9592,4.3859,1.242,0.1666,4.3441,0.0065,0.8843,3.7079,3.5787,0.2448,0.8129,8.4148,0.0779,2.5249,0.2527,0.0046,0.4302,2.643,2.5818,5.3558,0.0099,3.5076,4.9713,2.0313,6.5983,0.2584,4.6229,3.3821,5.5138,0.0511,4.1486,1.6861,1.2318,9.3407,2.6037,2.0394,2.1184,3.3626,0.9161,1.2551,4.4031,0.9217,6.39,2.8582,6.6972,6.5234,0.3839,0.6248,4.598,4.772,0.6047,3.8168,0.0122,1.4588,3.8722,5.3752,1.9987,4.1179,7.7389,2.1967,8.0282,4.1497,0.7584,3.3557,4.4234,2.6552,4.1958,3.0926,4.1483,5.4822,4.5283,7.2894,0.3867,3.6383,4.1564,6.7859,1.9122,4.2382,0.0032,1.2876,4.6331,3.5986,10.3651,1.261,7.1028,3.714,5.8759,2.3539,6.2102,1.7877,4.8642,0.0229,1.4745,6.0847,2.0874,1.9611,4.6409,2.2962,2.4044,2.3374,5.0763,5.3689,4.7648,3.4567,1.8153,2.0724,6.2528,6.8499,0.7718,0.5869,7.6425,2.2651,5.5966,6.475,7.6185,1.9456,0.7122,3.4625,2.261,2.1667,8.429,2.9513,1.6241,6.1121,6.4268,0.3057,1.7161,5.4893,0.5108,6.5534,3.8567,3.203,4.2562,1.1447,3.6804,8.5383,2.0506,2.2338,4.7423,5.3761,2.0378,4.0111,3.2492,0.1589,1.2097,5.0247,0.0489,1.0215,0.559,1.6863,5.2777,0.7566,4.0433,0.2115,1.0576,4.2832,0.717,1.8359,6.605,2.2083,0.0054,1.344,7.1489,4.1663,1.4222,5.8732,1.0657,0.9869,7.6146,2.8372,1.4174,0.8861,0.9689,0.9323,0.5699,3.4792,1.0171,0.3478,3.7325,1.603,0.7371,0.2442,0.0021,3.984,3.3732,3.7902,0.5828,7.4375,1.9178,7.3989,0.9539,1.2155,1.8122,9.1388,2.603,5.57,1.8943,7.6767,0.9492,2.1651,0.5456,4.8844,4.6049,0.5588,1.7395,5.6834,0.5309,3.8701,1.4398,0.0131,0.0024,0.002,0.014,2.9723,0.5087,7.2427,0.4149,0.0027,0.485,4.8306,0.8343,5.0401,4.8571,2.1807,1.9902,0.0951,6.9175,1.9676,2.8392,3.8392,0.0083,1.8757,4.3346,5.8341,2.0853,3.4656,5.8424,4.8257,0.5713,0.0052,0.8555,6.1769,4.1686,0.1526,0.2081,4.7503,0.5368,6.0698,0.0128,1.7193,3.7446,0.2915,0.8292,2.9381,0.0325,0.0014,0.0005,0.0001,0.0017,2.1188,2.2346,6.7905,0.3986,6.4045,0.1184,0.1548,0.9808,2.4901,3.4597,1.4723,3.7208,6.3672,1.1806,1.5725,2.7725,0.7057,7.5509,4.2386,3.8279,2.9313,0.0031,0.0315,0.004,0.0006,0.0017,0.9876,0.4833,2.9446,5.0983,0.0012,7.8234,1.4626,0.2008,5.2828,1.6233,7.1148,0.5063,5.0934,9.2333,0.3854,1.0278,5.5316,0.2045,0.3648,3.6028,3.3922,1.4103,8.2441,0.1126,0.5134,4.2755,0.8773,4.9126,5.0573,2.9078,0.1357,3.4867,0.0933,0.8417,1.7746,2.271,6.535,3.5066,0.4081,4.9717,0.9315,2.4565,0.0263,4.8646,3.4593,7.3899,0.5959,1.5762,1.8233,6.3467,5.0193,1.8268,4.3122,1.4585,3.644,4.9107,0.0101,2.6779,1.7881,0.0041,3.8781,4.8491,4.9227,2.9982,1.9602,3.4863,5.0292,2.867,0.3589,2.2884,3.1181,1.1873,2.7276,3.7506,9.6978,2.1824,6.027,1.2106,4.1021,7.1098,4.0102,3.1817,2.0771,5.2691,5.9999,1.8421,0.722,3.3573,1.608,5.8276,1.1544,3.5484,1.5336,4.341,0.5178,1.0281,4.4436,1.146,3.1136,10.9001,1.6056,2.4153,1.2817,1.9808,1.9359,6.8693,0.3768,1.7952,1.6272,0.86,5.7952,0.1574,4.7321,0.6779,10.1694,2.0772,2.8191,5.2823,1.7377,0.2511,3.005,0.0719,1.1916,2.1159,2.2181,4.7301,0.1448,3.0071,1.3697,0.4016,4.624,2.674,4.2396,0.698,1.7481,1.6578,2.1582,2.8726,2.8367,0.1229,7.1903,2.3382,0.5628,2.5228,0.1908,6.1119,3.0278,0.2375,2.7758,0.0978,1.5699,0.013,0.0129,0.0245,0.0023,0.0032,2.9058,0.5831,6.2212,0.2209,7.1045,0.0934,1.4507,1.0041,3.5819,1.4443,4.3401,6.8891,0.5289,0.5896,4.6067,2.0546,0.0937,0.8944,13.1671,5.802,0.6154,3.7608,2.1547,7.1876,6.6832,0.0979,1.045,4.4859,0.0261,0.0046,0.0113,0.0025,0.0035,5.3886,6.086,2.4688,1.9091,3.4711,0.0115,1.6273,8.2115,2.6255,5.068,0.5425,5.7871,4.4765,2.1081]}
{"prompt":"As part of the second wave , the 2nd Brigade had been landing since 05 : 30 ; the 5th , 6th and 8th Battalions were supposed to cross 400 Plateau and head to Hill","text":"As part of the second wave, the 2nd Brigade had been landing since 05 : 30 ; the 5th, 6th and 8th Battalions were supposed to cross 400 Plateau and head to Hill 500 where a strong position on the summit was being prepared. The 6th and 8th reached Hill 500 and were found unable to drive in the Germans who had concentrated heavily there.\nThe 5th had not progressed beyond Hill 300 where fighting was severe in spite of the many casualties which they had sustained. The attack on Hill 500 had been the purpose of the whole fighting but the 2nd Brigade were unable to get the 4th Battalion across. They made, all the attempts to cross the plateau and to push forward to Hill 550 which they expected to cover the flank of the advancing 6th and 8th and to keep them open.\nAt 10 : 30, orders were received from General Sir Horace Greeley Smith that the Division was to withdraw from a strong position on 500 Hill. The 5th and 6th Battalions were ordered to retire with their Brigade on Hill 550 and to cross the high ground to the right of 500 Hill in that order.\nDuring the retiring movement the 5th Battalion lost nearly half its strength as a result of casualties sustained in the heavy fighting around Hill 200. The 5th were allowed to occupy a strong position at the base of Ridge 300.\nThe 6th Battalion made the most of the available time in withdrawing their Brigade over the plateau until 13 : 30 where the 5th Battalion came up and shared the fighting. The 3rd, 4th and 7th Battalions of the 8th Brigade were withdrawn from 600 Hill over the next hour. The 6th Battalion on Hill 550 were attacked by six German battalions supported by machine-guns at a time when the enemy\u2019s fire had already dropped off. They counter-attacked with intense desperation and drove the Germans back ; although they themselves were also badly worsted they were able to hold the enemy\u2019s flank until the retirement of the Division reached a complete halt about 20 miles to their left.\nWithdrawal from the frontline was resumed the next day on June 13. In preparation the 6th Battalion was withdrawn from 600 Hill to a strongly held position at Hurlstone Hill and this was completed on the night of June 14\/15. On the morning of June 15 the 6th Battalion were to move on Hill 550. They had made the most of the time on the hill by building a strong defensive line. As the movement commenced, however, the 6th Battalion were taken in flank by a German artillery barrage and, to their great relief, they were ordered to withdraw and to halt in their advance about a mile in rear of Hill 550.","token_len":555,"entropy":[6.6379,0.0069,1.2464,7.2693,3.7359,1.8369,1.5477,7.6664,1.5409,5.9785,4.6273,2.3792,9.7845,6.6845,8.2251,9.7142,5.0508,6.5272,1.6218,4.3085,0.0257,3.5125,2.2613,0.0038,0.9831,2.4824,0.0013,3.5502,0.0021,1.5884,6.4574,0.0013,7.3756,10.4345,12.4176,0.3942,3.2451,5.7185,1.6025,8.5645,7.5799,5.4236,4.4582,5.8117,5.2603,4.7347,0.593,6.0153,1.8624,2.7667,3.3591,0.6965,1.573,4.2613,0.022,2.0185,0.8697,0.0017,8.581,1.0219,0.5273,2.6992,1.9579,6.8673,6.1703,0.0114,6.9924,3.883,1.6238,7.2984,3.618,1.268,6.3725,5.6957,5.7307,0.5235,2.4631,6.6755,3.3066,0.0319,4.5393,4.1937,7.2917,1.9945,1.1799,4.57,4.3891,7.4749,1.2189,6.9934,3.2824,4.8085,0.0021,1.0013,6.3091,3.6748,2.5828,3.2546,1.3768,2.1147,0.5865,1.1364,7.197,1.247,1.465,1.3143,3.0642,1.1821,3.984,7.4107,0.2412,0.5362,6.2086,5.4681,3.4516,1.5309,3.4641,0.1213,0.6537,4.285,2.2306,0.0218,3.6243,3.1469,4.8175,0.0262,3.9923,5.0937,2.817,3.2878,4.3392,8.6121,7.6931,2.4749,9.3073,1.0788,2.9858,0.9196,3.2676,2.3175,3.1214,4.4222,2.3502,2.6331,2.9907,5.276,3.4234,2.1793,4.5952,0.5312,6.9637,2.8467,5.8206,1.3029,0.3579,4.5467,4.8242,0.051,1.9273,0.3281,0.0053,5.5144,2.8522,5.0072,2.4779,5.5486,1.4534,1.6274,3.3543,3.3445,2.3007,3.2904,1.8766,8.2825,0.3392,1.995,0.778,2.3051,5.085,6.5941,0.994,3.2967,0.1686,9.3159,2.1861,0.9592,5.3112,2.4477,0.4297,3.9906,1.5898,5.9412,5.9793,0.1693,1.2489,8.0517,4.4899,1.9661,1.5598,3.8053,0.0134,2.0294,1.712,0.0018,1.2478,0.0002,1.0774,2.7172,0.1694,7.0647,5.1562,2.0647,7.7083,3.1426,2.2994,2.6582,1.3574,1.6533,4.9048,1.1676,6.0756,1.6164,2.2556,1.4562,2.4286,1.0552,6.0481,0.7505,4.381,6.5377,3.1755,0.2831,1.1229,5.0513,0.3966,13.3132,4.9265,1.3995,3.1039,0.0216,1.553,5.6262,5.3198,2.7115,1.0672,2.19,3.4893,1.867,0.1271,0.0141,4.724,2.995,2.1262,0.4721,5.4335,0.551,6.401,0.9814,5.5854,0.8212,1.3157,2.3345,0.0182,6.0308,6.2456,0.2225,6.843,2.6672,4.1944,0.0928,2.9598,1.4226,3.0692,0.4552,7.6032,3.1024,2.4167,1.5791,1.277,2.0687,0.0035,1.4001,4.2658,2.6958,3.0565,0.5409,1.1867,4.9786,2.4629,2.4696,5.9077,4.2799,2.3658,4.9574,0.7978,2.2938,5.0866,5.4901,0.3769,1.918,3.5541,2.0916,2.591,0.0178,1.9286,5.4159,3.5511,3.5351,9.2862,1.0428,5.176,1.8182,1.2769,3.8476,0.4085,2.6951,0.436,0.0027,0.2819,2.1771,0.0036,0.2381,0.0002,3.9737,0.1501,3.848,0.0705,2.0901,1.6625,5.5158,1.1033,6.5743,1.0901,6.6602,0.5167,4.4556,4.8366,0.9322,1.5251,2.4549,0.0146,1.3752,5.6769,1.7377,2.268,4.2885,5.4591,0.6542,6.2798,1.6214,3.8056,0.0001,7.0316,0.0339,5.7071,2.9502,0.9617,4.1999,2.3599,2.2683,0.4466,1.0511,3.0704,14.8627,8.9078,1.9734,5.3312,2.884,3.8118,6.3562,3.7851,1.0516,3.9961,8.8781,0.9716,0.4092,0.0072,2.2339,8.7938,10.1767,1.1362,5.3971,1.0943,2.0612,1.2823,8.6146,4.9931,1.7392,7.7342,1.0508,5.7848,3.932,13.4768,0.0518,3.7015,1.3456,1.7983,0.0209,2.2888,1.859,2.8153,9.0632,0.1828,0.0856,4.6589,2.8111,1.28,11.5636,1.0081,0.4184,3.6708,7.8239,4.8572,4.7158,1.7215,6.0672,3.0145,3.2984,2.6094,4.2638,1.1485,0.4789,0.4958,5.0972,5.4459,0.3137,1.394,1.1318,8.3096,2.0877,6.4415,4.53,0.9737,0.4835,3.9142,4.6229,3.6508,1.146,3.9689,5.7599,3.1902,2.165,0.0104,0.8093,2.434,4.8957,0.588,1.1742,0.1023,3.037,2.6212,7.1539,4.0753,0.1749,1.6026,6.3801,6.2024,5.9725,2.7867,3.079,4.9164,1.8874,4.9291,1.3807,1.697,3.7565,0.0878,0.3203,0.7635,9.0924,0.0502,0.6292,3.3014,0.7931,1.6352,0.0235,0.3116,0.7405,0.9293,1.4034,0.0053,0.2632,4.5635,3.3036,3.3482,3.0885,3.1252,2.0422,2.6166,3.4823,2.0812,3.4299,2.526,2.1465,0.2119,0.8573,2.836,3.1445,0.7394,2.5234,3.1679,6.486,1.4301,1.4028,3.5628,1.7742,3.2364,4.2786,1.0504,5.7683,5.6443,2.233,4.3748,0.0507,0.9262,2.1621,0.0079,0.4192,1.9945,5.7954,4.0136,7.1829,0.8312,2.0031,1.7551,4.3812,2.9283,1.801,4.5379,4.748,1.8772,2.0323,2.1236,0.0797,2.1567,0.9042,6.0856,0.253,2.381,3.059,2.3556,6.2474,3.4096,2.2335,3.5908,5.7059,3.2687,0.4386,4.222,5.7634,0.4044,2.5478,1.1992,0.3078]}

In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from the wolves ( a dog ) who were their European counterparts. In a study of black wolves on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, researchers documented an average of 40 percent more gray color in their coat than in other wolf populations. Although the origin of this gray color is not understood, the authors believe it appears to be connected to a low-level chronic disease, which affects the health span of this species. The gray wolves' average age at death was seven years. This is one year more than the average death age of a golden retriever, a highly trained dog. However, the black and black or white and gray varieties were rarely bred even more than 40 years ago. A single black female gray wolf with her cub was found in Idaho in 1962, and only one cub was born to a black female gray wolf in Michigan in 1968. The gray wolves have always been kept as pets and are considered good family pets. They can be highly intelligent, and they can detect the emotions of their owners. However, not everyone approves of keeping a gray wolf as a pet. There is a high incidence of wolf attacks by coyotes and foxes, so it is not recommended to keep a gray wolf in close proximity to human habitation. Some experts believe that the reason why gray wolves were kept as pets in the past, in spite of the fact that gray wolves are often called dogs - @ wolves, is that the wolf owners perceived themselves to be in charge of a dog, which was a much more manageable pet than a wolf. Unfortunately, this approach is no longer suitable for dogs now. However, as a companion, gray wolves may be just as intelligent as domesticated dogs. Gray wolf - @ dogs can be trained to recognize and perform certain tasks. Gray wolf - @ dogs show behaviors that suggest some of the same natural talents that were once expressed by wolves, such as canine intelligence and problem solving. Gray wolf - @ dogs that are well trained and are permitted to run free, such as in the case of the Oregon State University School of Wildlife and Education's Dodge gray wolf - @ dog pack, are allowed to perform natural tasks such as hunting in conjunction with human assistance. In fact, the wolf pack that resides at Oregon State University's Dodge pack has been hunting and successfully recovering carcasses of coyotes and foxes. Although gray wolf - @ dogs can be relatively intelligent, they are still animals. It is best to treat a gray wolf - @ dog as a companion.

All the matches aired in the episode were singles matches involving the match of the week or the main event which aired at the end of the week. Following the conclusion of the main event, the first match of the Smackdown Main Event (as the tournament had changed its format after the move to RAW) is aired. The tournament featured eight wrestlers, with one eliminated each week, until they all remained in the tournament.\nThis episode saw The Miz defeat Samoa Joe.

There are reports that the fire lance, one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm, was used by the Song troops to shoot at the Japanese during the invasion of Korea. The first military gunpowder weapons, including the cannon, were invented in the Korean war under the Song dynasty. The use of gunpowder during war led to greater efficiency in weaponry and was widely adopted by the Ming kingdom to conquer and maintain control of Japan.\nIn the late 12th century, the Japanese adopted several of the military customs and ideas introduced by the Song, such as the fire lance, the cannon, the bow and arrow and the military organization. Japan adopted the concept of warfare as the way to solve social problems. In the later Yuan Dynasty, the military spirit of the Japanese was also inspired by the Chinese Song Dynasty. For example, the Jubei family is an ancient military family. The three major branches of Jubei were: Jubei of Fujima, Jubei of Yamagata and Jubei of Kamakura. These three branches are closely bound to the Ming Dynasty. They were also closely related to the Japanese military in the Edo period.\nWith the strengthening of the relationship between the people in China and Japan, some concepts and techniques developed into Japan.\nFor example, gunpowder weapons, including the cannon and gun and the fire lance, were adopted by the Japanese and were used for political and economic reasons.\nAs a rule for the study of art, the Japanese created the so-called Sh\u014dmuki to divide the field of painting into the arts, making the first large-scale division into the Five Elements of Painting.\nIn the early 16th century, the Japanese began to use ceramic ware to display paintings, giving birth to the art of miniature paintings.\nIn the early 17th century, with the advance of the Satsuma\u2013Yamato War, the Japanese started to study and develop the decorative concept of S\u014dgure.\nThe Japanese S\u014dgure was a kind of decorative pattern. It is similar to the Chinese paper painting. But the S\u014dgure embodies the decorative idea of the Japanese era and is not an imitation of the paper painting of China.\nFor hundreds of years, the Japanese have lived under the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty. There have been many famous figures made by the Ming and Qing dynasties.\nThis kind of porcelain is richly decorated. Generally embellishments involve a series of images, and this series of images generally follows the order of the text. The use of many similar objects to represent the same image plays a role in emphasizing the meaning.","token_len":558,"entropy":[9.7107,3.2671,1.2539,10.9847,2.6422,0.6711,6.894,10.3154,1.4732,8.1913,4.3158,3.1625,0.0077,6.75,0.0351,6.8551,1.1185,5.3319,1.3438,4.8793,0.814,1.119,6.0136,8.6465,2.211,3.3954,5.6858,0.154,0.1969,3.205,11.9656,0.0678,0.9315,6.4698,0.2356,0.7151,1.5033,1.3862,0.7852,1.2771,8.1844,1.8012,3.4318,2.5347,1.6264,6.1325,3.1765,0.4053,4.3754,0.1475,1.7335,0.658,1.7752,4.3714,5.8494,2.9172,1.0874,2.5194,3.0779,4.7702,0.4736,5.6032,0.6916,0.3851,3.1303,1.0896,1.2302,5.2039,3.8984,6.4785,0.4171,4.9899,1.0956,0.7548,1.5479,3.7414,0.0275,1.5888,0.0018,3.7371,3.7452,4.2652,0.2029,6.4973,3.7541,1.2009,5.595,1.392,4.3051,4.8077,1.9437,0.9061,0.5339,6.2623,8.0494,4.6164,7.0357,2.2213,3.5266,2.6859,0.7686,5.9161,0.3424,1.368,8.2242,1.3842,2.8837,4.227,0.0429,0.4062,0.4382,0.998,4.6016,4.4757,4.4874,3.1112,0.3402,4.4289,7.9093,1.548,5.3763,5.7287,0.7885,0.261,0.9437,2.5674,1.992,0.0021,1.0689,5.3152,0.2996,0.0287,0.5669,1.6843,4.3238,0.2944,1.7073,3.6999,1.2235,0.6612,2.1512,0.5572,8.1162,7.002,0.7352,5.7942,3.454,1.6101,4.1943,0.0388,4.4169,1.3935,2.0726,4.101,0.5652,4.6998,5.0278,0.1415,1.236,2.6079,1.204,5.0414,6.9608,1.3234,0.4103,0.8687,3.2438,6.1145,0.9721,0.5281,3.2494,1.6214,4.3512,5.1506,0.1894,0.6444,2.4494,7.2763,4.7747,0.853,5.0459,0.5815,0.0396,1.0132,6.3963,9.069,0.056,5.6,4.051,4.266,1.8352,4.2999,1.3505,3.061,1.3043,6.3759,4.0059,2.5341,0.1103,4.3909,0.2249,0.0128,2.5526,2.6793,3.8231,0.7677,0.0732,4.9427,6.4423,6.7392,0.4311,1.1992,0.0475,0.0032,0.1042,5.9985,0.7839,1.7622,1.1508,0.2369,0.0183,0.0026,0.056,5.787,0.4277,0.197,3.6067,1.0494,1.44,2.0866,4.3804,7.2575,4.1019,0.9932,4.5809,2.5098,1.2515,3.9403,1.7576,2.9082,2.018,1.6905,0.3158,0.5465,4.1566,2.3738,4.2114,1.6126,7.9349,0.0778,0.2264,0.8256,1.3436,5.5558,0.3464,8.2576,0.0647,0.4853,6.3558,0.2029,0.4118,5.0472,3.9449,1.4801,0.2239,1.2471,0.4106,5.8346,7.2221,2.2753,3.5643,1.5918,4.9882,5.0356,3.2132,2.961,4.6156,0.2078,0.0501,5.8689,0.0083,1.5739,3.1973,3.0133,0.4297,2.7773,1.7159,3.5021,7.8368,3.2586,2.7995,0.0394,0.0071,0.7194,0.5118,4.3199,0.6092,0.2523,2.1636,4.2029,1.7603,1.303,2.8524,4.3685,1.7768,1.9697,2.0164,0.5484,1.7478,4.2631,1.5714,3.752,7.4443,1.3344,7.2662,0.0642,6.9479,0.8829,1.4279,3.0239,5.0842,3.1371,7.1752,0.2829,0.0014,5.52,3.9184,4.5272,7.1682,5.8484,9.3549,0.8645,5.1182,0.5604,3.2523,1.2837,3.8901,5.2057,2.6258,6.0197,1.7174,5.4818,4.8674,2.0307,0.0135,8.376,2.3922,2.1536,8.9445,3.2289,1.9331,1.4018,0.6643,1.7923,2.3055,0.8081,2.1333,3.5853,0.0158,0.0586,0.1279,0.7681,2.4338,3.3352,0.7611,1.6007,7.3262,5.5087,1.916,6.0962,4.3486,2.1904,5.9302,3.7765,0.0075,0.6796,4.6124,0.8502,7.1341,2.886,0.4643,1.4395,1.7156,0.5685,1.5332,0.9203,0.0241,0.0255,0.0608,5.9979,0.2131,5.468,0.17,1.3356,7.0393,3.1903,0.2063,8.2127,3.6613,1.7828,5.6832,3.5664,0.5214,0.625,1.4691,3.2792,0.4688,5.7022,2.6164,1.7149,1.3704,7.1011,8.3474,0.0875,7.0224,4.7327,3.9199,5.776,2.0634,1.6446,1.6119,2.8393,7.0973,1.1177,0.1185,0.0194,2.0563,1.3952,4.6243,0.0032,4.1909,4.8226,3.3027,1.697,3.0573,4.2962,0.1849,0.9574,4.017,7.9659,4.4028,2.2724,6.0383,1.8018,2.778,0.1479,0.0293,0.0124,9.2261,1.0959,7.1248,3.7076,0.3171,1.2703,3.7381,7.2235,2.2699,1.5181,2.9953,3.2872,2.8885,0.3494,0.5132,4.9516,0.6483,3.6184,3.6696,0.2176,1.1239,4.3216,8.7856,0.0285,0.0579,0.3828,0.5943,1.1306,2.917,5.6508,3.2427,0.742,5.6096,1.5001,1.8889,2.2729,0.9564,0.5015,0.6703,4.5936,2.8562,0.1051,1.5779,5.8757,3.6562,7.6459,1.2267,0.2323,1.739,2.7677,0.0942,0.8756,0.0419,0.0,0.9501,1.5392,4.3405,5.7568,0.0012,8.9547,0.0135,0.0014,2.9257,7.2413,2.2958,1.1396,2.314,7.7371,10.1804,2.7702,0.0048,7.1538,2.7746,3.9417,0.0037,6.0501,1.662,3.4695,3.5257,6.0608,0.9944,0.3328,6.546,5.7629,0.7486,5.3613,0.1569,0.4985,5.8563,0.7797,1.7372,5.6118,0.0162,6.0782,6.3263,2.9709,3.1771,2.2489,1.3305,2.2421,3.6276,8.2486,0.5642,1.8443,0.5501,8.3702,0.3842,4.3613,2.1599]}

During the 19th century ,","text":"In the late 18th century the harvesting of kelp became a significant activity but from 1822 on cheap imports led to a collapse of this industry throughout the Hebrides. During the 19th century, when sheep grazed in suitable fields of kelp, kelp was harvest for food. It was in the late 19th century that the harvesting of kelp in Scotland became profitable. In 1863 the annual catch of kelp in all Scottish waters reached 12000 tonnes.\nFrom 1872 there was a considerable rise in the harvesting of edible, small kelp, known as razorclams, and from 1880 to 1980 annual catch nearly doubled. The razor clam industry remained relatively unimportant until the late-19th century when the industry expanded, largely due to the introduction of motorized trawling gear. Following the ban on the use of trawl gear, small-scale shell fishery, using hand-locating gear with line trapping rods and trammel nets developed. A new industry using trammel nets also began to develop for the harvesting of other marine species.\nThe industry suffered major setbacks in the early 1980s. There was a fall in the razor clams price to almost zero as a result of the European Community Marine Strategy. Kelp began to be caught, particularly off the Hebrides, at levels that made it commercially viable. Whilst there had been a fall in catches in some areas in the 1980s, there was a recovery in some parts of the west coast over the last two or three years. Kelp farming is no longer practiced in Scotland, there having been no economic returns from this operation for nearly three decades.\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s kelp was the main source of food supply for some of the remote coastal communities in Scotland. It has been estimated that the wild population of kelp in the United Kingdom in 1968 was 10 million tonnes, of which more than 6 million tonnes were taken down from the coast. Kelp meal is sometimes used as a pet food, as pellets in livestock and avian diets, as a fertilizer in cereal crops and in horticulture, and as a source of food for marine animals. An experimental breeding program currently in place to increase the size of kelp in the United Kingdom for its potential use in aquaculture has proven to be a success in the short term. Kelp has been bred to be taller and thicker, to produce far more biomass, and also to produce far greater yields of the essential oils from within, making it much more valuable commercially. This is largely due to a more favourable symbiotic relationship between the kelp and its algal symbionts than that of some other edible seaweeds and is one explanation for the exceptional high nutritional values of kelp.","token_len":559,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,4.6847,0.1202,0.3294,3.1713,11.5782,0.2924,9.5303,0.0195,4.9833,1.1414,3.914,3.3354,5.6682,6.271,1.904,4.5719,5.7823,11.3627,4.7073,6.0617,0.0714,1.3698,5.5214,1.48,5.351,1.5577,7.1741,0.7286,10.934,1.1102,0.1464,0.7867,4.1702,0.5226,2.6778,0.0039,0.1195,1.925,4.4529,7.3047,7.1056,0.068,1.3868,8.8212,3.4101,5.1028,6.4074,0.0061,0.8839,4.5113,0.0717,1.353,9.6215,4.5604,3.7693,1.6142,3.5422,0.705,4.3255,1.7712,2.8337,0.6811,0.0117,0.0324,0.2244,1.2936,4.6247,0.1058,0.8255,0.0047,5.8359,6.8999,1.6013,4.5714,1.0269,2.1235,5.5572,1.7168,7.0086,5.7014,0.8147,0.9885,0.0062,2.0841,6.3241,2.9083,2.4922,3.0886,4.4043,5.7649,0.9133,0.8491,2.0779,12.1525,1.056,3.7852,4.7213,0.9965,0.621,4.9682,4.1103,0.0838,0.7581,5.5055,0.1407,6.993,4.6539,5.2292,2.9323,0.0035,2.3418,5.9258,0.1072,11.386,6.0666,5.9515,1.0311,2.1195,2.1611,3.3682,1.0732,4.478,7.0698,1.2273,8.6729,0.266,0.6903,1.9589,8.5457,9.41,4.2163,5.7513,2.843,3.7459,4.1191,1.1348,0.8668,2.0687,6.5731,0.9377,0.1594,0.0209,1.3911,1.3777,3.8904,3.9279,3.413,5.3868,1.3559,0.0054,0.6769,3.2297,0.0152,7.4213,2.7764,6.0678,0.4315,3.5902,5.7767,1.0502,5.8636,0.5865,7.2692,0.6186,2.1481,1.2195,0.0063,3.6384,3.566,1.4901,1.9351,5.5583,3.1102,0.4752,8.507,7.7681,0.264,4.3827,5.6415,5.8613,1.0086,7.8045,0.5448,2.8347,4.5971,8.5804,9.6221,5.6017,2.1573,6.0189,5.9774,1.6181,3.6168,6.9998,0.9094,4.295,2.8239,1.9362,7.6323,4.6198,0.0619,0.343,0.2292,4.9502,2.0847,1.1246,1.7607,5.7459,1.702,4.6981,0.0415,5.2162,3.592,2.2248,0.9684,1.2081,1.8159,4.2014,7.3679,5.0248,2.1974,1.5059,0.3873,1.1211,3.399,0.0535,1.9016,4.8131,1.1237,0.8884,5.0043,0.2352,0.7371,12.7529,2.2628,0.0658,5.3054,3.1476,4.0979,2.8737,3.6239,2.519,0.147,0.0128,0.8296,5.8927,6.6114,12.5958,6.0344,1.4456,8.8929,0.0233,4.682,0.0902,1.4359,4.5333,4.2191,4.8269,6.7404,0.7811,4.1124,0.0029,0.0077,0.9746,4.3792,4.6826,2.2274,4.8538,0.7283,6.0187,0.4957,0.8075,7.3672,2.6777,3.8163,0.0996,1.5703,3.6355,0.1101,7.0784,2.2093,3.0531,0.8336,3.2319,0.3918,3.3963,0.0496,0.623,1.9679,0.8617,1.4639,4.7559,0.5944,2.6663,3.2375,0.0863,0.4512,6.7047,1.845,6.5798,0.1283,1.8459,2.6677,3.9935,0.0065,0.7182,0.2729,4.7858,0.0412,6.436,3.5281,4.8634,0.0553,6.8344,1.0148,1.0177,1.6681,5.6915,10.1435,0.1069,1.6865,6.1869,7.1186,2.3675,2.1177,4.7565,3.4664,4.1275,3.1352,0.1827,0.1354,0.8269,4.5338,0.3477,2.4793,2.8399,0.0312,1.4726,1.4717,0.0007,5.4492,0.0082,1.5423,3.6095,1.4872,1.1181,0.0671,1.5578,5.3741,0.9005,3.5975,1.3725,0.4808,6.6041,3.1472,1.4869,1.6167,1.1748,0.3665,2.9715,3.4436,1.0531,2.7248,0.0763,2.39,7.0492,2.3426,0.4934,1.1185,0.0108,1.4742,1.6058,5.0026,0.2073,4.5183,5.5763,0.801,4.3821,1.9313,1.7327,1.4599,3.157,0.0285,4.0596,0.0507,4.3964,0.6294,0.5129,0.9052,4.4903,6.4272,2.1802,0.9284,3.2597,1.4402,5.4309,0.022,9.3406,1.6727,5.7743,2.4296,0.8246,0.5208,7.3637,0.0994,1.9202,2.8319,8.6922,3.0603,6.0802,3.6869,8.1198,3.1508,3.4441,1.8071,2.7383,1.0921,6.331,2.2577,6.1339,2.0509,0.9841,2.4093,8.2374,0.3232,0.7187,2.1872,1.0705,0.9565,0.4811,3.3104,0.0298,2.8545,0.6907,4.3968,1.9715,0.7996,6.5045,7.2351,5.4245,1.0628,8.4307,1.8349,1.5998,2.3646,3.737,0.6774,4.2048,0.1465,1.6388,0.0066,2.0454,1.2915,3.8572,0.1027,4.4089,4.662,4.3856,2.3027,0.6872,5.0289,0.0675,0.0075,1.3535,4.9462,1.2415,0.1942,2.1602,0.7418,3.1829,2.4111,3.7939,0.3611,0.563,4.3555,0.0233,2.5087,1.2201,4.6184,1.6061,1.95,9.2376,1.4142,4.1719,1.9254,2.7259,2.4953,6.3623,0.7934,5.8923,1.215,0.5518,3.8471,0.7687,1.5313,3.7825,3.2509,3.0573,2.2319,4.0962,4.3773,3.1944,4.0171,8.0619,4.7202,4.7733,0.5247,4.4083,0.537,4.0534,6.6155,0.8316,3.7786,1.7643,4.441,0.4641,0.0105,3.5526,4.8656,3.5056,8.5681,0.1132,0.1388,0.1932,0.7975,1.7718,0.0043,0.7324,2.7094,7.6917,0.7301,2.9794,0.2985,0.1869,3.309,4.1232,3.2913,4.6631,0.8743,4.0007,4.6519,0.9334,3.2764,5.1724,4.4745,6.9183,0.2057,0.4002,6.5318,3.7048,5.247,3.6553,0.547,1.2222,0.0056,0.7838]}
{"prompt":"Du Bois used his influential role in the NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents . When the silent film The Birth of a Nation premiered in 1915 , Du Bois and the NAACP","text":"Du Bois used his influential role in the NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film The Birth of a Nation premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP challenged the viewing of the movie, urging black and white audiences to boycott it. When the film was shown at a major movie theater, Du Bois walked off the set before the movie could begin. Du Bois\u2019 campaign to ban the silent movie ultimately failed, however, because it was a success in the black community. His opposition to the movie also helped to pave the way for the release of the first black-owned movie theatre, the Ebenezer movie theatre.\nIn the 1920s, Du Bois was often called on by President Calvin Coolidge to give \u201cwhite\u201d audiences a window into the realities of the South. Du Bois was a champion for civil rights and equality. Because of his opposition to racism and the Civil Rights Movement, he was a vocal anti-communist. Du Bois had a unique ability to view people as human beings, not as victims.\nIn 1968, Du Bois received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The award was made posthumously. In 1972, Du Bois was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1973, he won an award for his work with The Freedom Defense League of Southern Illinois. The same year, he also died in Indianapolis at the age of 96.\nThe Du Bois Institute was founded by him in his home in the Northside neighborhood of Chicago in 1967. His institute is primarily devoted to preserving his memoirs, writings and the history of the Civil Rights Movement. The Du Bois Museum is also housed at the institute.\nMany black schools in Europe use Du Bois\u2019 name in some way, in some small way\u2014most obviously the Du Bois Institute in Belgium. Although he had traveled as a young man to Europe, Du Bois never became fluent in the language. He studied Italian and German but could only speak them at a beginner level.\nHe was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. His contributions to the civil rights movement were significant. He was an influential figure in the movement in the United States.\nDu Bois\u2019 book, The Crisis of our Time, was published in 1899, which made him probably the first African-American to publish a book. Prior to this, many black authors who wrote for African Americans read books that were banned from circulation in the United States. (For example, in the 1800s black abolitionists in the Union states would read books that were banned in the South.) Du Bois\u2019 text had an impact on African Americans internationally.","token_len":559,"entropy":[8.8375,2.209,9.1883,2.3876,8.522,3.7375,1.1799,1.2811,8.7929,0.4261,5.483,3.5233,6.3747,0.0014,4.1283,7.019,2.265,4.7641,2.1032,10.2916,4.7908,3.8767,4.0144,0.0618,0.0289,0.0002,2.8225,0.8591,7.4595,0.1791,4.9451,0.0186,0.0017,3.8956,2.5927,1.1009,6.5367,0.7818,8.1224,1.3098,0.824,2.3432,2.372,5.0736,5.3362,3.9989,0.5335,0.7473,0.2227,3.3339,1.6696,0.4893,4.1914,1.0501,1.5219,0.9969,4.2646,1.9478,2.5365,4.4569,3.3616,0.3545,1.498,0.4694,0.0064,0.0013,6.628,3.3744,1.5256,1.5457,4.8671,1.455,2.8843,3.0162,2.2527,0.6522,2.3588,0.0053,0.0008,13.5613,8.417,9.3955,2.775,3.5285,0.9555,2.6387,2.3014,8.348,1.2746,1.3868,3.7832,0.5031,2.5992,2.1712,1.6618,3.098,6.2931,2.3753,1.761,4.3293,0.0781,0.5237,5.0209,5.6489,0.2811,0.631,2.2695,4.1147,3.4088,2.0995,5.7418,0.0167,0.0093,0.0248,1.158,4.9092,0.0254,1.2133,2.3216,2.0414,2.5719,1.5455,2.1454,4.911,2.4051,1.3658,10.8502,0.5377,0.0002,9.2124,1.8221,1.4995,1.3871,9.2541,2.0847,2.383,0.0747,0.35,0.9285,0.0142,0.0013,2.0589,6.5694,3.4099,3.1244,1.668,4.5261,4.1919,0.0423,0.0001,0.2015,5.3858,15.4069,4.7443,7.2968,5.5309,6.1166,7.794,1.327,6.8683,0.1763,0.7903,5.9839,0.044,2.0154,4.4349,0.6023,1.7626,0.0077,0.0021,1.8614,2.1243,4.6901,1.9225,3.3501,0.0178,1.3572,4.5839,1.7867,6.0401,0.6248,0.4919,4.2005,0.0731,2.6926,1.5931,2.219,4.6838,0.2914,3.1027,0.1883,2.0553,1.2496,3.1804,2.6316,5.6119,0.181,3.0749,0.011,0.7928,2.0603,0.0089,0.0022,4.2805,1.5965,5.6697,3.2072,0.1986,7.6673,4.2066,1.9934,3.6376,0.2415,1.7451,2.6079,1.1382,6.3999,0.9669,1.9573,2.3993,5.9666,0.1254,0.7277,0.0122,0.0021,4.3075,1.0164,2.9511,0.0226,0.677,3.0245,1.3092,1.2275,1.696,0.708,2.1676,0.4697,0.6724,0.0035,0.4138,2.4503,2.4282,0.9557,5.0764,10.6032,0.0003,0.0159,2.0774,2.3791,3.2835,0.0654,0.6739,0.0036,0.0023,1.1421,2.3802,0.7749,0.326,5.7865,0.2211,0.0475,4.262,1.5665,1.6926,2.9436,0.0817,1.0608,3.7206,2.9478,2.8879,1.1195,1.1985,1.7934,2.0918,4.6519,5.4934,5.679,2.5748,3.6913,3.8338,3.333,0.789,3.6176,5.0635,0.0304,0.2106,1.1185,4.293,6.4665,1.8788,5.2816,3.4819,0.7923,0.0106,0.0216,3.6386,0.1965,0.7195,2.9603,5.0561,0.0222,0.0074,4.8201,2.3241,0.6539,1.645,6.5722,1.1186,4.9213,1.4518,1.4565,3.0798,5.1063,4.1543,1.9638,0.1358,1.8036,1.2242,4.2176,0.2503,3.2859,4.1308,2.3504,6.2666,1.3759,0.0081,5.2725,4.7964,9.4155,0.6406,1.2236,4.7064,1.3991,3.9226,2.514,0.077,1.1049,3.4819,0.0355,0.3076,0.4282,1.9287,3.4524,0.0125,0.0055,5.5069,1.3682,3.4942,3.3782,1.6306,0.3593,5.9337,0.6792,1.0708,5.7694,6.415,6.3806,1.9967,9.0062,4.4457,1.1344,0.0168,0.0038,7.2052,0.1902,5.2182,2.7695,5.3941,2.0889,1.9491,4.183,2.6683,6.391,0.4011,6.216,5.6378,6.2698,3.5295,3.7585,0.0524,0.0169,2.5099,1.2988,5.1087,0.639,4.7486,2.8961,3.7052,6.6451,5.1721,1.6457,3.5367,0.6095,1.0352,2.6909,0.6415,0.5734,0.0037,0.0057,3.2096,4.3209,4.2898,0.1058,1.6962,0.4097,1.6545,1.921,3.6956,5.8275,1.3617,2.8335,4.0785,4.3293,2.9139,0.5633,3.3139,2.9743,3.2378,7.4361,0.1934,0.4479,2.5158,3.2504,1.506,1.8716,2.4778,0.0076,0.2307,3.1584,1.6057,1.4614,0.5897,0.2171,0.0002,0.0024,0.0062,0.0109,0.0076,2.1152,2.9482,4.9225,0.568,0.7844,2.4282,0.0045,0.0398,1.5403,3.3613,1.2422,1.3381,1.5177,2.8057,3.7755,1.7085,0.311,0.7721,2.6089,3.7405,0.9912,1.5328,0.0018,1.1828,1.7783,2.4225,0.0171,0.0029,2.7503,0.0355,5.2569,1.8706,2.2348,7.8261,0.2136,5.8712,1.7551,0.8654,0.9388,0.619,0.4014,9.2664,2.4603,4.3101,4.2233,0.6908,9.1642,0.1215,1.0997,1.2158,0.4339,0.0093,1.2457,3.0936,0.9082,0.7491,1.7908,7.3944,0.0023,2.0989,0.5377,4.6866,2.5289,3.3833,4.1829,3.5128,2.0213,3.4108,2.6925,5.9751,3.7159,3.2442,1.8175,6.8124,1.7537,2.736,1.6307,0.6853,0.4012,0.0026,0.3554,5.3941,3.6286,0.9694,0.0517,3.2736,1.4848,5.4085,0.0805,5.1273,4.4415,0.6306,3.5698,0.978,6.0128,5.3965,4.5235,3.2314,1.9267,0.9448,0.8694,0.6335,1.6162,1.085,1.7664,0.9536,2.1905,0.0018,0.0046,1.4935,0.0064,9.2767,5.9114,3.275,1.6989,0.3308,2.83,1.1406,8.2514,0.7248]}

V. Vijayendra Prasad was watching a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and < unk > are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the Mughals. With the help of Bheem, they had killed the Mughals. At that moment it is observed by the Mughals that there is a lot of blood on the wall. Then they go and find him. He tells them that they killed all the Mughal soldiers by using his magic. This moment, Sivaji asks Bheem if he was not told to kill one of the Mughal soldiers? Bheem answer, \u201c I am also a Mughal, but I am a Mughal that fights for my people by killing the same.\u201d Thereafter, Prasad ordered Sivaji and < unk > to kill him. Sivaji is confused and at first he decides to execute himself but later it appears that he does not want to kill him. However, during the film, Prasad is seen dead with his body being burnt. Why is he burnt? In the movie, even Prasad had ordered to kill the Bheem before, but due to some reason, he did not succeed to kill Bheem. One reason is that the Bheem gave a poisoned ball to the Mughals ( who later finds out and saves Bheem ). In the film, a shot is shown in which the ball is shot from the back. Since the Mughals were busy with defending themselves, they failed to find the ball. Since the shot is from a distance, it appeared that Bheem is shooting the ball. However, looking at the shot, it appears that the Mughals are shooting the ball from the front. In an interview with the Indian Express, one of the lead actor, Vetrimaaran said that it was not difficult for him to work with Rajinikanth. They came from different cultures and had a different background. At first, both of them fought a lot. But when they realised their difference, they gradually accepted each other. They both became close with each other and the movie was done.\nThe movie is directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, produced by B. J.

The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent scene \u2014 Lucy's interrogation and execution \u2014 occurred in a motel set.\nSylvia Hoeks had trouble believing that the film was going to be made. She recalled, \"The producers were there with their people, and at the end they had a little dance like a couple of puppeteers. They came up to my dressing-room and, as soon as they saw those costumes, they had that grin you see on actors on the stage and said to me: 'Is that you? No! It's not us. We have never read any of that!'\" Hoeks said of the production, \"Tonight, I'm going to die. You won't miss it.\"\nThis is what the people in power have decided,\" he said, looking around at the packed audience. \"There is nothing you can say that is going to prevent that from happening.\" In December 2007 Fox gave the film an R-rating, though Paramount's Home Video version has it uncensored.\nThe film's music was composed by Eliot Fisk from a novelty song that Fisk had earlier composed for a Broadway musical called \"Jelly Roll Kings\". The score had just been announced at a ceremony in Paris.\nA number of songs appear to have been written specifically for the film (or at least in reference to it). \"Telephone Song\" was originally written by George Gershwin and then repurposed for the film by Ira Gershwin. \"The Wagon Wheel\" was co-written by Eliot Fisk and Charles Martin. \"And If It Happens to You\" was co-written and originally song by Howard Goodman. It was later changed to \"My Favorite Things\" by Eliot Fisk, based on a verse of the same name from the poem written by Christina Rossetti.\nIn 2006, actress Jane Seymour was among those who criticized the film for the way it portrayed FDR. Seymour, whose father served in World War I, said of the film in a column in The Washington Monthly: \"For many Americans, it isn't just the historical accuracy of FDR being an alcoholic and an impotent man that is up for debate.

{"prompt":"Starting in 1870 , flags were created for the Japanese Emperor ( then Emperor Meiji ) , the Empress , and for other members of the imperial family . At first , the Emperor 's","text":"Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor ( then Emperor Meiji ), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family. At first, the Emperor's flag was blue with white stars. Other flags for the Emperor and Empress soon included a red star in the center of the blue field.\nIn 1883, the Imperial Household Bureau developed the official Imperial Japanese flag. The official flag, now in use, includes blue with 15 white five-pointed stars around a red five-pointed star in the middle.\nThe Imperial Household Bureau also produced a flag known informally as the \" White flag of Japan \". The White flag of Japan is made of a red border on a white field. The imperial star is the only part of the flag to be a white star, and hence called \" a white star \". The phrase \" The Imperial White Stars \" (\u7687 \u5100 \u7d2b \u82b1, lit. literally, the Imperial Purple Flowers ) was added in 1927, as the word \" Empress \" was deemed too similar to the English expression \" Queen \". In 1930, to emphasize the fact that the White flag of Japan was just a flag, the phrase \" The Imperial White Star Flag \" was added.\nThe white flag of Japan has been used at the end of certain ceremonial occasions. For example, on the day of the Imperial Household Bureau's in-person presentation of an official flag, a representative of the Bureau would take the flag from the Imperial Household Bureau's treasury, place it on an Imperial flag board ( \u5fa1 \u7528  flags or flagbonds ), and then carry it to the Emperor for presentation. In the same way, when the Imperial Household Bureau presented a new flag to the emperors, the President would take the flag from the treasury, place it on the Imperial flag board, and then raise the flag to reveal the presence of the new flag. During an abdication ceremony, the flag is raised to show the presence of the former emperor. Later in the day, a flag carrier would take the flag from the Imperial flag board, place it over the flag bearer, and carry the flag to the hall where the emperor would enter, followed by his grandchildren. Afterward, the flag would be placed over the emperor's coffin to signify the end of the ceremony. The flag would be carried to the Japanese Embassy or Consulate of the country the emperor was visiting to show the official presence of the imperial family. For example, in March 2009, the last emperor of Japan, Hirohito, had his funeral at the Imperial Tomb on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. Before the Emperor could make his traditional walk to the Imperial Tomb, a flag carrier was waiting to raise the Imperial flag, and carry it to the Imperial Tomb.","token_len":563,"entropy":[3.6078,9.3004,0.258,11.7709,1.2752,4.9406,1.7077,1.7402,7.4995,4.3773,4.5574,10.4641,1.6083,7.5128,0.0704,1.5313,2.3465,4.5171,3.5179,0.6775,3.6287,4.2709,3.2514,0.0208,0.3125,3.2611,0.1484,0.5847,4.9992,2.8887,0.3901,1.3952,3.5596,1.6945,1.242,0.3781,4.7181,2.1679,2.3189,2.71,1.6936,5.7864,1.5014,4.7105,0.7329,2.1494,3.1351,2.083,6.9956,4.1151,2.4141,1.645,2.456,3.8551,0.7694,0.895,1.467,0.2387,5.6246,4.5195,0.942,1.8353,6.2506,1.5558,3.6837,0.179,0.8483,3.3402,5.7055,7.032,5.9836,1.7129,4.1523,3.0241,5.57,1.5991,1.3752,1.2256,3.0389,1.0862,3.2453,4.7114,2.5207,1.4524,1.5892,4.4469,4.3524,4.309,8.5476,2.8491,10.0087,0.8789,0.8293,0.2993,0.0663,5.6797,2.7983,2.5718,6.1077,0.1955,0.0332,0.0462,0.1973,2.9667,0.3493,3.8843,1.1668,2.2288,1.3666,2.0504,3.1273,0.8162,2.4277,3.0848,1.2821,2.8327,3.5904,10.0677,0.0587,0.0518,0.3175,1.7616,8.6415,5.7311,2.3827,1.6252,1.8684,1.2291,2.0429,0.3258,2.2936,0.0777,1.8447,3.5464,1.0646,2.4149,3.0309,6.1183,3.7607,1.751,0.9991,4.8535,1.6145,1.0155,4.4839,7.8757,1.3484,3.1603,3.372,3.2641,0.0989,0.0678,0.6619,2.2616,1.1675,4.8872,1.7864,0.282,2.0447,1.2758,5.3144,7.2348,2.0386,5.1399,1.9001,0.2314,0.7286,1.2336,8.4013,0.3269,4.1661,1.7432,4.2015,6.504,1.1056,3.3538,9.8975,1.1108,4.6863,5.5936,4.6623,3.2047,2.7412,2.8876,4.8801,3.2517,3.2224,1.7487,0.1128,9.1104,3.0309,3.1509,3.2884,6.3261,8.0781,1.2408,2.0776,3.0302,1.6312,5.0303,2.1907,3.0514,1.9239,7.3355,0.5385,9.2985,0.3685,1.444,6.0819,2.1171,5.0205,0.2609,0.5643,3.3783,4.3751,0.5914,4.7475,1.1436,2.7297,3.7977,0.1346,6.9997,4.9588,0.429,3.554,0.0485,0.5818,4.1324,0.8114,0.901,0.0468,0.8487,5.9338,1.1014,2.855,1.0803,0.6077,5.7197,0.3389,1.8161,0.5092,0.1719,2.4803,5.2241,0.552,0.9007,0.4297,1.9,0.7811,1.2896,5.0034,1.2305,0.491,0.099,3.1662,1.3386,1.7566,4.6726,2.1792,4.2617,0.016,7.5157,5.1802,0.9231,1.9247,2.6509,0.2587,0.0845,2.7933,1.442,2.6156,0.2464,0.9768,3.3282,5.1148,0.8538,0.4105,8.6166,0.5099,3.895,4.3329,0.7088,4.5387,2.0322,2.389,1.2489,2.3371,4.0937,0.3444,0.1785,7.6296,2.3189,3.8466,0.9977,1.4142,2.007,0.4918,3.1115,0.3607,0.4206,0.9849,6.2864,1.6364,2.7509,0.0728,1.0599,3.7902,3.1242,2.7013,4.6722,4.186,6.6117,4.4141,2.5261,3.173,3.357,4.0016,2.7114,17.0281,5.0725,3.6531,7.1639,4.3686,0.9837,0.2895,1.397,4.2919,0.2532,0.9278,0.3885,3.5865,3.7884,2.4478,0.7774,2.6444,2.0524,3.2037,0.753,0.1074,3.5349,1.0752,1.6967,0.4466,0.1482,1.5833,1.3292,3.6981,0.7203,1.957,0.3307,7.906,4.2491,1.3376,0.9324,5.1318,0.9285,2.8029,0.6039,0.8077,0.3092,0.2183,5.1025,1.9857,0.8561,0.0393,0.2013,1.1328,1.458,0.2773,0.1207,0.591,0.1387,0.5702,7.2087,0.8108,0.7611,1.9277,5.7544,0.5256,7.1232,0.0416,0.3085,3.3052,0.8455,0.7646,4.3328,4.5071,9.4749,2.9198,0.0158,0.4994,0.4274,0.5876,3.0576,2.5844,3.0226,1.0056,4.5914,0.67,2.5785,0.0234,0.241,5.681,1.5576,1.0526,6.779,2.9911,0.6302,1.8385,0.1384,2.5537,2.5485,6.0714,0.4883,2.1785,0.3117,0.4622,0.57,0.107,1.1072,5.5783,0.1405,1.2562,1.1351,0.0315,5.6567,0.2386,2.6124,5.7369,2.2371,0.2216,3.5896,2.5003,0.1029,0.5429,0.2838,9.0579,2.3539,0.4484,3.322,2.048,6.0934,3.1809,6.706,0.0413,3.0017,9.1774,1.2017,4.3864,3.3096,0.0664,0.4615,0.6802,1.338,0.1655,3.3643,3.3335,0.1817,2.9907,0.1702,3.809,3.4528,2.9949,0.9104,3.754,0.0346,0.8349,1.413,0.2084,2.3376,1.612,4.0987,0.9035,3.2972,0.8775,0.2948,6.2308,2.0741,3.9377,3.9806,0.1395,3.499,1.2172,4.9392,5.7301,3.0688,2.4333,1.5486,3.4205,4.9665,0.897,4.9667,4.1317,0.1234,0.1788,3.127,0.2162,0.596,4.7863,1.2481,0.0163,1.8716,5.2673,5.7715,0.1975,0.7727,6.5832,3.4952,1.376,0.7174,1.6796,3.0093,0.0822,0.0613,1.2461,3.1698,1.9791,4.2153,3.2006,0.4004,1.0778,6.1059,3.5758,0.8327,2.6411,0.0847,0.3107,0.8848,1.1024,0.9878,5.7212,1.0841,3.1575,4.3873,4.1479,0.7739,7.3364,7.2756,1.257,0.2966,2.4518,2.0635,0.215,2.6745,3.5698,0.5464,3.6269,3.9239,2.5105,6.8905,0.1843,3.0982,0.5452,2.8795,1.1622,6.7592,0.5699,0.389,0.1874,3.7097,2.5342,0.9043]}
{"prompt":"Kaplony has proposed that Shepseskare started to build a sun temple named < unk > @ - @ jb @ - @ R\u02c1 , reading `` Hotepibre `` and meaning `` Satisfied is the heart","text":"Kaplony has proposed that Shepseskare started to build a sun temple named < unk > @ - @ jb @ - @ R\u02c1, reading `` Hotepibre `` and meaning `` Satisfied is the heart ( of the sun-king) ''. Shepseskare had several names and titles. On the basis of a few lines (the famous first line), a conclusion has been made that the most important title of Shepseskare was R\u02c1. In addition to the titles of a High Priest and King, Shepseskare and his family were also called pharaoh, divi, and the priest of Amun and of the sun. This implies that Shepseskare was the supreme religious leader of both Thebes and Memphis. Moreover, the titles of king, high priest, divi, pharaoh, and the priest of Amun\/ sun in combination with the mention of the temple of Amun-Shepseskare on the border of the northern kingdoms of the Memphite and Theban kingdoms have led to the conclusion that Shepseskare was both Theban and Memphis, possibly king of both royal states. The title of divi implies that Shepseskare probably possessed at least two important religious functions. On the basis of some literary evidence it has been suggested that Shepseskare also had the title of pharaoh. (See Phases.) The role of Shepseskare during his active reign has yet to be clarified. Shepseskare appears during the reign of Ramesses I and his son and grandson. The latter was the founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty. There are a few fragments, but no lines, which mention Shepseskare's name in connection with the construction of the large temples of Seti I. Therefore, the evidence is inconclusive and Shepseskare remains unidentified. For the identification of Shepseskare it is worth noting that he is mentioned by the name < unk > in the tablet of Khufu and by the name @ jb @ in the inscriptions of Ramesses I. In addition, Shepseskare appears in association with the kings Heka I and Kamose I.\nAt least some inscriptions mention Shepseskare's names along with his sons. Thus, one of them says, \"Menkaare (son of) Aahmeskare, [and] Shepseskare \" and another, \"Ineptahkara (son of) Aahmskare, Shepseskare \". This shows that Shepseskare probably had two sons named Aahmeskare or Aahmskare.","token_len":563,"entropy":[7.6823,9.9756,6.0572,6.9233,1.7349,9.6462,5.4895,8.5442,8.3862,7.721,9.4885,3.5519,4.5266,1.6727,10.1195,3.148,7.1508,9.4692,12.3746,4.664,6.4319,9.3993,7.3191,6.3081,6.1639,5.3209,5.6086,1.4406,0.7944,6.3857,12.0179,4.514,6.0101,11.8755,9.9386,12.2585,7.6863,7.9193,4.5782,5.301,2.8613,7.9167,0.9634,11.5074,1.7842,6.1526,2.483,6.8803,6.1568,6.7914,1.7815,2.838,4.5456,6.876,1.4922,7.7705,6.0833,3.5542,0.616,0.0533,0.018,0.0095,4.8162,6.0972,5.7533,3.2241,5.2573,2.1491,5.4837,1.473,3.5794,0.0393,4.1871,4.1441,5.187,4.4377,3.9063,7.5237,4.819,1.6881,2.5426,4.2072,7.6129,3.3646,0.2831,3.1169,0.9694,1.6283,5.9425,1.2959,3.8205,1.6044,2.5009,0.0088,0.0029,0.0113,0.0057,0.8415,5.9038,0.5782,0.0103,1.2437,3.3039,3.3172,1.4713,1.6676,4.1391,1.1418,5.0225,10.6172,0.5538,1.781,5.0542,0.5045,3.0488,0.0079,0.0013,0.0064,0.0048,5.6284,2.6381,2.6944,1.807,1.2141,2.8364,9.6903,1.719,3.5746,7.2047,5.2719,0.3569,1.6553,4.213,5.9798,2.1347,8.59,3.2687,3.4809,3.7413,1.7089,3.6181,1.2076,3.1707,6.144,0.2239,1.3918,0.002,0.001,0.0047,0.0069,0.9745,1.7047,4.3996,5.6914,1.8365,0.8158,6.0183,6.064,0.4838,0.1055,7.0194,0.5952,6.2615,0.0691,1.6051,5.1416,0.4415,6.3819,1.7672,4.5665,0.1261,0.1916,3.124,0.0783,0.1013,4.7734,0.0174,0.1859,0.2724,2.5049,1.9965,0.2224,0.2346,0.0011,6.7091,10.4036,5.3879,4.9272,0.4468,0.7005,8.0555,0.0731,1.2368,5.864,2.1806,2.3353,0.0045,4.5948,6.3815,0.0745,0.0299,0.4502,0.0146,4.5234,0.5952,7.7322,0.5631,1.0712,6.1739,6.9202,1.7516,1.7015,11.5217,0.5457,2.2368,2.3633,4.4242,2.2013,2.9822,3.1912,3.5948,0.5532,1.1849,2.3678,0.0423,0.8026,0.0016,0.0008,0.0047,0.0053,0.4393,6.4916,5.7504,0.6746,0.4339,2.2339,2.5797,6.0827,8.5194,0.9788,2.2295,9.2549,4.3394,0.5008,1.9547,3.5246,0.5064,6.5831,0.1132,6.7207,0.3737,1.0796,0.0014,0.0007,0.0033,0.0069,6.5365,5.1235,4.7124,0.0423,2.3626,4.3703,3.2816,4.0038,0.9115,4.3856,0.224,1.4305,0.0037,4.3542,6.0592,1.9739,4.3601,1.7469,0.2034,1.0134,0.0841,1.3527,0.0018,0.0009,0.0036,0.0054,4.4865,1.6541,2.1743,1.6429,0.6199,3.7213,0.0318,1.2602,4.7857,2.4539,5.6018,5.0642,5.3597,1.7562,5.9341,0.1814,2.8747,0.0035,0.002,0.0062,0.0096,5.6322,2.943,8.9037,2.5716,3.2291,6.2606,0.013,0.0287,3.4545,0.466,4.459,0.0893,0.0027,0.0083,0.0128,5.0395,6.3061,0.896,1.5738,0.0864,6.6621,0.0662,2.3216,1.5785,3.0658,2.2281,4.3977,3.3983,2.4925,2.0939,4.2888,2.1352,1.8586,3.8502,0.2216,0.6238,9.8907,1.5813,0.2186,1.924,4.7733,1.218,3.4947,1.5296,4.6566,4.1882,3.2156,3.2962,8.313,2.18,2.3738,5.0688,1.6769,0.002,0.001,0.0044,0.0098,1.9935,2.7128,2.2407,2.6643,0.0369,0.9443,5.2436,0.0909,0.4757,7.277,4.2845,1.8177,8.2854,3.4357,5.1878,2.5913,6.2229,0.307,1.6603,5.1769,2.6218,3.0429,0.0008,3.1634,3.8822,0.0018,0.0011,0.0057,0.0064,5.8448,4.4594,0.5349,4.895,1.5794,5.4889,0.0714,1.2415,0.0015,0.0012,0.0037,0.0083,5.5559,0.5501,5.2099,1.181,0.1116,2.0444,1.8776,2.7634,3.1279,1.5599,2.1204,5.7126,1.9772,0.1056,0.8276,2.162,1.0342,8.0382,0.8979,5.9526,2.8082,0.3334,3.5153,3.0997,0.9224,0.9209,5.0929,3.5104,0.1839,2.1153,1.7418,0.3476,6.4985,0.0756,0.3769,4.6943,0.0345,1.0299,1.2719,2.8486,1.797,0.5634,4.0458,0.0022,0.0012,0.004,0.0063,2.6217,0.6988,9.912,0.017,0.7793,5.3024,8.2301,5.8112,4.6697,0.7283,5.7833,8.3834,1.2691,1.1291,3.6591,9.0504,3.0565,3.3131,7.7627,0.0006,3.5637,1.0003,0.0022,0.0015,0.004,0.0063,1.2371,5.8105,6.7342,0.0702,1.5533,4.9799,1.4303,4.8347,0.3669,4.2022,2.0556,4.4133,4.0231,2.009,0.7518,7.5327,6.2436,9.2581,3.662,5.0922,0.3367,5.0133,4.9707,8.1675,9.3818,2.7925,0.5641,1.6523,5.4035,3.4671,1.0224,6.7142,0.0267,0.0292,0.0277,0.0275,6.5257,2.3834,1.8722,3.0747,0.232,3.7192,5.5553,5.4213,4.4458,4.1085,4.938,1.0277,0.6789,0.0117,1.059,2.2664,1.117,4.8983,0.2658,0.2447,0.812,5.4278,0.0142,0.0015,0.0089,0.0158,4.3789,2.7971,5.1281,0.2858,0.92,0.0013,0.0012,0.0033,0.0063,4.2776,1.7965,2.4658,5.1469,3.2859,2.8564,0.6458,1.3651,0.0328,0.4216,4.2801,1.1599,0.6058,0.6628,0.0362,0.1828,1.1032]}

Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12. He attended New Westminster High School. After he graduated from the school, he moved to Victoria, so that he could get more lessons and training in music, and then to Calgary, Alberta, where he had the chance to meet fellow musician Greg LaRocco. At the age of 19, he moved to Los Angeles, where he met his future longtime musical partner, guitarist Greg Lake. Townsend continued studying music during the 1980s, and during this time was mentored by keyboardist and former session musician Peter Hook.\nIn 1991, Townsend and LaRocco formed the band Queens Of The Stone Age. When a new album was needed, the band invited bassist Chad Smith to join the band. The band was successful, and in 1992, it released its first album, Queens of the Stone Age, which featured the singles \" Noon \" and \" I Love It, \" produced by Mark Knochen. The second album, Transcendent, was released in 1993, but the band was only able to make two more before splitting up in 1995. The subsequent singles from the band included \" Transcendent \", \" Crack The Wrong Skull \" and \" Go For It, \" but the band was rarely able to be reunited and continued to split in the years following. Townsend then focused on solo projects, and he played on the album Nightmare Before Christmas. On June 4, 1997, Townsend and Lake were reunited to co-write a song for David Bowie's album Black Star ( 1997 ). The album contained the single \" Starman \" ; Bowie produced the album.\nIn 1999, Townsend formed The Silverlake String Band to perform his original material, and while he recorded the album, A.F.T.! ( or Art Forms To Follow ), he also wrote a song for The Smithsonian Collection, as an homage to the American Museum of Natural History. In 2007, he opened up a recording studio for rock bands, called The Silverlake Studio.

U @ - @ 111 was fitted with six 53.3\u00a0cm (21\u00a0in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one 10.5\u00a0cm (4.13\u00a0in) SK C\/32 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin 3.7\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) C\/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four to fifty.\n\nService history\n\nU @ - @ 111 was laid down at Essen as yard number 1 049 by U-Bootwerk AG on 22 January 1939, launched on 27 June 1939, and completed, under the name U @- @, on 27 August 1941. She was commissioned into the Bundesmarine on 27 September 1941, with Captain Friedrich Motzfeldt at the helm. At an unknown date, U @ - @ 111 was re-designated U @- @ II as an anti-aircraft boat, her name and numeral designations being changed to U @- @ I on 20 September 1944. The anti-aircraft boat was refitted in December 1944, with additional armament being installed. The boat remained in active service for the next year. She was decommissioned in March 1947 and laid up in Wilhelmshaven.\nThe wreck of U @ - @ 111 was recovered from a depth of between thirty-seven to forty metres (121 to 141\u00a0ft) by a salvage team working from the shore between 23 October and 8 November 1952, under the command of Lieutenant Hans Huber. An analysis of the wreck indicated that it sank on 14 May 1945, on her third patrol, within hours of completing her scheduled voyage between Wilhelmshaven and Wilhelmshaven. She sank in approximately 50\u201360 metres (160\u2013190\u00a0ft) of water, just before midnight, between the islets of Wiesinger See and Nordsee, about 5 nautical miles (9\u00a0km; 5\u00a0mi) southeast of the village of Umsland (a modern-day village north of L\u00fcbeck). This accident is commemorated on the Umsland memorial plaque, by the International Submarine Convention which is located on the coast near to the wreck.","token_len":566,"entropy":[9.8435,6.6107,5.9163,7.9616,2.73,8.049,2.4229,0.6187,0.7082,4.5085,4.9781,0.2629,1.6986,3.4245,1.3024,8.3045,5.5622,7.3315,3.4385,1.7273,7.5297,14.9918,5.9072,6.0523,9.4053,7.4499,1.6348,5.273,0.1598,2.8916,11.7889,5.3226,5.4983,5.7192,7.4155,6.9402,2.7357,3.139,1.1158,5.9892,6.7294,1.3172,11.2918,8.2702,2.5358,2.1211,9.3238,2.3808,9.533,4.9131,3.0546,6.6398,3.8149,1.2952,4.4693,3.9747,2.0527,3.6259,3.4418,5.108,5.2641,0.2097,2.3707,7.2725,3.1498,1.035,5.3074,0.5075,1.5927,5.0503,2.8513,3.2281,13.0657,3.8681,0.1789,0.0499,5.5913,4.2616,1.5723,2.6096,2.2929,0.7346,1.1293,1.4744,2.4712,3.0252,0.1124,5.4338,1.7953,0.0047,0.0071,0.683,1.9505,0.062,5.3117,4.8333,0.3065,2.9911,6.8336,0.8376,5.185,0.665,2.5785,0.6727,0.5899,0.1812,1.6928,2.2447,3.7983,0.0529,4.9596,9.9705,2.7508,2.694,3.3832,3.4743,2.1335,4.5788,2.8903,0.7493,0.1408,4.1682,0.2285,2.4354,4.046,6.5214,3.2742,1.5102,4.989,1.8183,1.3089,0.4854,0.107,0.9246,1.6138,9.2394,4.4091,0.0207,1.2054,3.2622,5.7707,1.6276,1.3109,2.6888,1.3046,0.4348,2.4912,2.145,6.7774,0.3368,0.076,0.0941,11.3189,9.2651,3.8782,7.1545,8.2475,2.9161,0.8785,10.8604,2.7152,2.0935,2.4515,1.9927,8.0615,6.4842,0.7873,2.891,1.3388,0.9852,0.17,1.4422,0.1171,4.4448,0.1086,0.0691,0.067,5.5603,1.0314,3.8281,3.6807,0.0854,1.9819,0.0176,0.9534,0.5269,2.2837,6.6409,2.2033,1.172,6.1684,0.0265,8.1514,5.4944,1.8616,2.7436,4.6426,1.0067,4.4435,2.5562,7.1928,8.9447,2.9302,1.1902,0.0082,2.8658,0.6209,0.3015,0.065,1.3361,0.9268,7.0321,0.6479,2.939,8.717,0.2311,5.2,12.3591,3.452,3.1959,9.3908,3.5825,5.4463,4.4209,4.3916,8.6588,7.4751,1.4573,6.9741,2.557,3.7637,2.5266,3.949,1.6811,8.7349,1.6406,3.7548,3.118,1.5131,1.6267,1.3481,3.9687,7.2412,3.6212,1.1103,2.3391,1.3214,1.3659,5.2699,2.36,5.2619,1.4571,3.3674,2.1731,1.5883,0.4138,5.681,0.5194,2.7787,4.2781,1.0699,7.6109,4.127,1.6916,3.4046,2.0303,1.1042,1.3889,3.0971,8.155,5.4833,9.9281,1.9065,8.2685,2.5292,4.3209,1.0792,0.6657,0.6637,3.8612,6.1516,4.8247,0.4889,0.8609,1.4053,0.1239,0.377,0.0117,0.4512,0.7001,4.4128,0.3481,2.3672,0.0017,1.409,0.7994,0.5995,0.4925,6.9011,3.1944,4.1121,3.7761,0.0352,0.9239,0.0028,4.0364,1.7824,6.0851,2.1695,4.5737,8.2748,0.0049,6.4996,0.562,1.6363,3.4181,0.8217,0.6463,0.4178,0.7333,0.5218,2.7366,4.1399,3.5134,2.2199,2.5953,0.6777,2.1927,7.724,0.0032,0.0753,0.0021,3.4679,0.7303,5.3865,0.0435,3.1018,3.5778,1.3755,1.4957,1.3874,4.1556,6.0321,0.1033,2.4051,3.7988,2.5062,1.9764,3.5424,4.053,0.9041,5.3116,0.0266,2.2884,2.3038,1.3598,3.8087,1.3901,2.9564,0.4717,3.6798,0.0008,0.0003,1.3925,3.5614,3.4006,2.2157,5.9107,3.3751,1.8439,8.3325,0.3455,0.1805,0.075,2.8855,0.9828,8.5716,6.3389,0.848,0.1729,0.0956,0.1181,0.0065,0.2413,0.9038,4.5596,1.4867,2.2247,4.4066,0.0507,6.4707,5.0633,1.2773,2.6224,2.661,0.4519,2.7147,1.6333,6.1759,0.5163,4.799,7.2501,2.116,0.9478,1.9283,2.1784,3.1591,2.1986,4.9834,3.414,1.4643,4.097,5.9575,5.1105,3.0141,1.7711,3.5513,0.4206,5.3947,1.9241,3.9021,0.639,2.6347,0.0238,2.7571,3.6523,6.8912,1.3917,0.8482,5.4153,5.0434,0.3568,0.4321,1.0698,3.5103,0.2745,1.4022,6.3728,2.4433,3.6677,3.0944,3.8656,1.0255,3.7194,5.3853,3.9432,5.6213,1.4936,6.4176,4.835,0.2451,6.0769,1.0153,6.2058,4.7138,5.3413,3.8602,0.0018,0.0106,0.0021,0.2426,5.8804,0.0612,0.0241,0.3159,0.7073,2.8095,3.4469,2.2508,5.8225,4.3819,9.0294,0.8381,1.4661,0.2592,4.0123,0.9458,3.4875,0.3858,0.0519,0.2268,0.5158,0.3728,1.343,5.9728,2.6262,5.3959,2.0614,5.8976,2.4965,9.5613,1.1695,0.4018,4.3411,3.6781,8.1952,10.6286,0.9053,8.2478,6.6783,1.8431,3.4545,4.97,5.0141,0.0024,0.0205,0.4884,1.9564,4.0482,0.2367,2.3939,3.0087,0.848,0.1281,0.8486,3.4115,0.0385,1.6783,4.3514,0.1242,4.4845,6.7286,5.2453,3.9123,4.9801,7.7003,3.5439,0.0162,2.7905,5.6966,0.0588,5.1641,2.2095,1.2784,0.5568,4.0583,5.2468,3.2886,4.9825,0.0262,2.4578,0.9838,3.4984,6.6594,0.5465,4.1582,2.0637,2.6793,5.9545,1.3086,7.6776,8.7146,0.0857,6.4688,4.8357,2.4237,4.7857,1.6471,0.2658,5.8412,3.5507,5.964,0.5114,2.1163,0.6078]}

Although he said a few minor issues about the storyline were resolved, he was still open to letting the series continue, though it had to have a more consistent plot, and at least one more episode.\nLike most reviewers, he was confused to see why the series ended. He said it was strange to watch characters who have been around for an entire series go through the motions of making a final farewell ; he said the main reason was to ensure a sequel, which was more than a little off-putting for him.\nDespite this, IGN was still open to letting the show continue.\nOther reviewers who were more negative were TV Guide's David A. Rubin and IGN's Jeff Gerst, and Rob Lieber for MTV's Digital Spy magazine.\nLieber, in a general review of the series, went as far as saying it was unnecessarily long, and concluded that it was a waste of talent and money. Similarly, Rubin said it was a waste, and stated it was `` the worst superhero series they ever made. ``\nThese comments could be seen as a great disappointment, especially considering how hard the show was trying to make this season their strongest yet. However, they were probably more concerned that they could use one of the best seasons in the series to end it on a high note, and they have not been proven wrong ; both Lieber and Rubin have confirmed there will be an end to the series.\nHowever, it might not be such a bad idea to go ahead with the plans they have in mind, because there are still at least two ways to have the series continue.\n1.The final issue will be a comic book, and be drawn and co-created as the comic book would have been drawn and co-created for a three year run, with all of the writers, artists, and production on that issue written into the show.\n2.The final issue of the series would be written by Jeff Lemire. Since Lemire has been on the books since season number two as a writing consultant, he could probably bring back the idea of putting it under his own pen, which would make for a much better ending for the series.\nBut hey, these fans did all right by the show, and they have had this season to call their own. They proved once again that the show should remain in the hands of these fans, and the writers should listen to them more. It only takes them one more season to prove it, and the show - if it does get continued - can continue to be one of the best superhero shows on TV.","token_len":567,"entropy":[6.9724,7.2848,7.2405,4.5139,8.1863,9.8466,1.3522,3.7191,1.931,5.4749,1.0895,8.7462,0.8448,5.9704,8.2901,2.6212,0.1844,3.99,0.9057,0.3767,6.4929,11.7186,11.7139,4.5946,7.4635,4.7044,5.0871,0.9484,0.8313,4.5752,0.1188,3.483,14.3535,5.3129,7.8972,8.1465,6.2233,3.8659,3.3643,2.4929,3.1545,0.8903,2.9145,4.0846,7.5213,2.9846,3.1893,4.6868,1.4819,6.2079,4.3016,4.3811,1.1521,6.169,4.0995,3.8378,0.6888,1.3235,3.0017,2.8637,6.5286,0.2339,5.6293,2.0085,2.8339,2.0464,2.2004,3.0838,2.7445,4.2653,1.9248,4.7889,1.9243,3.2119,4.7506,3.0736,2.7799,1.8308,4.7435,1.3446,1.4457,3.3795,2.0567,1.8958,2.1681,9.5187,2.5233,3.3893,0.3687,1.9823,1.9409,6.3208,4.8098,1.3164,3.8815,1.855,2.5893,3.3954,2.7807,1.6334,2.1793,1.8268,0.8815,7.2764,2.2839,3.8035,6.2563,3.8542,3.0792,1.8427,2.8545,0.5872,5.3621,0.9459,2.6007,3.3199,1.9866,2.5874,2.4014,1.1452,3.682,1.7833,3.7974,5.8323,8.2706,1.3468,2.0229,1.8413,4.3224,1.9791,1.638,2.0358,4.7619,3.6186,5.6923,2.7645,2.8284,2.0476,4.921,2.7422,2.3054,0.9797,5.7311,1.3751,0.2915,0.0005,2.9569,2.0431,0.5244,1.6744,5.0287,1.9127,0.3698,4.966,3.1366,3.9735,4.3188,0.2168,2.9967,0.3685,2.2776,0.124,1.3629,2.0863,6.221,1.9442,3.7838,2.3314,3.5882,3.9737,1.7894,10.5228,2.538,0.5396,3.7266,4.5063,1.5781,6.6992,1.4315,3.7252,0.2393,4.3835,5.23,0.1071,7.9868,3.023,6.3377,9.8138,1.2188,5.4623,7.531,0.7572,7.871,4.5783,3.5965,0.4681,0.854,11.4297,0.0161,3.1508,3.2712,2.1811,5.9441,2.4203,1.14,0.5442,0.9911,0.2476,5.434,1.5535,0.0395,0.0635,2.1322,2.0636,0.673,7.509,2.6871,1.0145,1.6291,7.2263,0.8011,1.199,1.0306,2.1359,3.1352,0.0658,7.3605,1.8317,1.879,0.6359,7.9272,0.0624,5.6758,1.807,1.32,0.4118,1.8785,0.8079,6.9857,1.2019,5.2614,2.5286,0.5492,4.7015,4.8445,2.3909,8.6401,1.386,6.3467,3.285,2.3579,1.6958,3.1322,1.5167,6.7453,2.5842,4.7529,0.9237,2.7194,0.3082,1.6227,6.3334,4.9039,1.6521,3.1351,1.8974,2.4948,5.3494,2.053,1.6321,1.4035,3.8561,0.0588,2.4243,3.681,2.0963,10.0698,6.876,1.7611,0.3102,3.079,0.0179,2.5465,1.5404,4.5275,2.7672,4.534,3.035,2.4901,2.9247,4.5942,4.9642,0.9037,0.5544,2.9586,5.4085,1.6941,1.268,1.3139,1.0464,5.1699,2.5029,2.4274,0.4109,1.4746,0.0229,1.3037,1.426,3.5288,4.8891,3.4245,2.1938,6.0253,0.549,7.5204,5.7336,4.8937,0.0167,0.1278,1.2191,3.2646,6.2041,4.6109,1.8214,0.1624,3.3123,2.6154,0.7779,0.4133,0.6231,1.4113,0.4764,4.6859,0.0234,2.5825,4.5038,1.853,0.5727,5.0661,0.1037,0.9604,0.995,0.5904,3.5281,2.7218,1.6842,1.7359,6.3253,5.1233,1.9498,2.6093,0.356,1.518,2.9204,2.7242,1.1962,2.8292,5.583,0.0093,1.5965,5.3616,1.001,5.5553,1.1165,0.8984,2.0872,0.8217,1.5243,3.3273,0.4918,8.8371,4.2529,5.7633,3.097,0.973,2.7332,5.5175,0.5541,3.3668,2.1336,6.5723,4.8423,4.8982,6.3475,0.0123,3.2187,6.9153,3.1376,3.0591,0.7026,4.3567,1.2965,0.3811,3.7,2.8252,0.8807,0.0009,0.9903,3.7521,3.2571,6.6128,3.9079,1.4703,1.9077,2.2318,4.0982,1.8895,0.1351,4.9947,3.3036,0.9175,0.3483,0.5176,4.1354,6.2509,5.1937,3.2543,6.2145,6.0794,0.7943,4.9049,0.5383,0.8697,0.6413,0.0014,1.844,1.3953,0.1265,2.986,0.1507,1.3267,3.3514,1.0013,2.996,0.7551,4.5011,2.7791,0.0052,2.1453,6.0373,2.4643,0.005,1.9111,1.8983,3.658,0.8576,6.0343,1.5841,4.7403,9.1751,1.9697,6.898,1.9787,6.3035,1.4127,0.5569,1.1953,2.8423,3.0038,4.8814,3.1415,1.7958,3.6811,0.4304,5.601,4.603,6.4267,2.0207,1.2052,4.2558,1.4733,2.8532,0.739,2.487,3.2679,0.6667,2.2094,1.0343,2.7064,2.4587,0.287,0.5593,0.3546,0.4572,5.1354,6.709,0.1274,5.81,5.7918,5.5532,4.5607,3.8159,1.7182,1.3614,1.5373,1.0319,0.7826,2.0614,3.4642,4.3884,5.1843,3.5487,3.4039,7.2289,0.3716,0.0274,0.6175,3.4011,8.8764,4.5875,0.1837,0.4595,1.8756,1.4278,4.8196,4.7137,2.8626,0.9949,3.3729,0.005,5.5226,1.3021,0.7045,0.4135,3.1922,3.1173,3.0306,6.7765,0.2578,0.6823,4.0838,1.2197,3.8445,6.4149,1.5227,6.3326,1.7004,0.6622,1.0064,0.6258,4.5444,2.6269,1.4136,0.4178,2.6984,1.6028,7.6108,3.0227,0.788,3.3721,3.3224,5.4391,0.3557,3.0674,1.7594,0.7682,1.5949,3.0134,0.056,0.1234,0.6702,1.0925,0.447,2.2095,1.5384,0.4292]}

According to Vogue magazine 's Edward Barsamian , Rachel","text":"Both Rachel and Aniston have become fashion icons due to their combined influence on womenswear during the 1990s and onwards, particularly among British women. According to Vogue magazine's Edward Barsamian, Rachel was a much better actress with a larger stage presence than Aniston, although not as convincing with a speech, and despite her ability to make jokes, was \" pretty quiet \", less expressive and less passionate than her rival, \" a little cold and distant \". Aniston was \" the funniest and the brightest... you can say what you like about Rachel, but she is the one that made the cast come alive. \" Despite that, the actress with whom anon was closest to was Jennifer Aniston. With anon, Rachel was the type of person with whom it is hard to act friendless, saying that with her one could \" be a total slut and behave like a prude all at once \", and that she is always worried about what her friends are thinking. ( In his interview he also admitted that with anon he was jealous, but would not act on it, because \" they were too close \".) According to anon, Aniston was the actor with whom he would like to have a threesome. In 1996, anon commented in an interview for The Hollywood Reporter that Rachel is the best friend he has, but when they are not together, he tries not to look for her, and he is closer to Jennifer Aniston. On a later interview with the British magazine Elle, he said he is attracted to both actresses, but is the kind of guy who likes to be in control so he prefers Jennifer Aniston.\nDuring a 1995 interview with a British magazine, anon stated he did not like Jennifer Aniston very much, and that she would be the kind of actor that would always have the same performance, or the same reaction, in every role. On the interview, he said he liked Rachel a lot and that if the two actresses were friends, it would be best. According to anon, the most beautiful actress that he has ever taken home was Jennifer Aniston. Both actresses have often won various awards and have a great fan base. On an interview with the British magazine Elle, anon gave a more detailed description of each actress, pointing out how important the roles that each of them had in his life.\nAn on-set interaction between Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Aniston was so natural that the whole crew laughed at it. Anon was the first director to make the characters in Friends appear as real people and not just actors.

The gameplay is split into two types of sections :","text":"The Ace Attorney games are visual novel adventure games in which the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes. The gameplay is split into two types of sections : the client's testimony during police interrogation, where the client can give their version of events and defend himself, and the courtroom, where the defense attorney must try to convince the court that their position is valid.\nA visual novel is a type of game that involves a story presented visually rather than verbally. Most visual novels are set in a two-dimensional world, similar to role-playing games, and use a character sheet for the player character to interact with different events. The role-playing aspect gives visual novels a feel of something closer to anime than games. Unlike anime, in a visual novel the player is usually presented with no dialogue options except for the character's emotional reactions, instead the players character directly interacts with the game environment.\nAt the courtroom, the defense attorney must use their powers to try to convince the judge to consider their version of events. This is done by giving their client some form of evidence related to the case to be proven (such as witness statements or other documents ) and giving an argument to support it. These arguments may be based on the laws of the land, psychology, or any other form of logical reasoning. The judges actions during these arguments determine the outcome of the case, and as a result the outcome of the case may affect the rest of the game.\nIn the Ace Attorney games, the player plays both sides of the argument, but at the end of the game only one side is chosen, usually the side of the best lawyers. During the questioning, the attorney must try to keep a calm face and avoid reacting too strongly to questions from the police. However, if one loses the case, usually it is the attorney who has lost the case.\nIn some games, the lawyer may be accused of committing a crime. At that point, the player must find a way to convince others to back their case. The most obvious are the family of the accused. The police, the judge and even judges from other locations in the world may be contacted. Each of these contacts may offer a new piece of evidence, or even the conviction themselves, of the attorney's crime.\nThe legal profession that attorneys represent may also be investigated in order for further evidence to be collected. Some lawyers may not be so ethical as to do this, and even if they are, the investigation may just lead the prosecution to discover the truth about the lawyer and their clients. Most lawyers will be happy to cooperate and have the police bring evidence that will help them be seen as more involved with their clients and their cases. Others will try and get revenge on the accused or even do some illegal work in order to further their own interests.","token_len":567,"entropy":[11.0366,3.0873,2.9714,2.1513,9.6767,2.3393,6.6666,0.4244,2.8663,0.7658,1.4806,0.8828,2.3738,10.4464,2.1564,2.1949,5.149,2.4024,1.0311,2.5342,6.321,1.216,7.2521,0.7258,1.6118,5.6626,1.2381,5.2873,0.2519,1.263,4.0706,1.0857,8.0647,7.5384,2.1632,9.0047,2.2994,8.918,4.7799,7.0254,2.5183,0.9176,4.1505,0.4568,3.16,3.0034,4.8164,3.8701,4.1732,0.0316,0.1506,1.9087,4.7687,1.7596,1.6512,0.2332,0.3317,4.8731,3.6977,0.1178,0.2677,2.5042,0.4569,3.1917,5.0626,0.2426,2.1655,0.4167,1.7526,0.8849,3.4546,6.0463,0.5733,3.5776,0.58,1.4873,7.2094,10.1974,0.0116,2.9296,0.7367,3.605,0.0107,1.2412,1.5262,3.0691,2.0039,3.5861,7.6362,6.2428,4.4154,0.0068,6.2301,0.4519,4.3997,2.7523,0.1638,1.33,3.1396,0.2359,1.0641,7.7879,0.2744,0.2182,0.3929,1.1726,5.0144,0.096,7.6516,0.1766,0.0115,0.0811,1.5777,1.9522,4.7149,1.8389,4.648,5.119,3.5009,1.4522,2.3656,4.2948,0.8673,3.7603,0.0575,7.3798,4.5242,0.9389,1.7597,5.7909,0.5087,0.0178,4.8997,6.8173,8.6165,0.4483,0.6807,5.7482,0.2271,6.2089,5.4612,0.0275,6.0167,1.7293,4.3791,1.1414,5.0418,1.2264,0.3795,4.4471,1.4994,0.3761,0.0072,1.7056,0.9051,1.7887,5.2013,3.834,0.265,4.6914,5.0706,6.4858,3.7879,0.947,1.6575,3.0886,0.75,8.2971,2.9133,1.8388,6.095,3.8622,4.5501,4.4286,6.6178,1.2218,0.0325,0.3564,2.4761,4.983,0.9174,1.1895,5.5622,0.9006,9.7431,0.4958,0.4725,2.1232,0.2662,2.0936,3.4971,2.399,6.9858,0.614,3.4587,0.343,0.2947,0.1858,1.7997,2.5139,4.4402,1.7234,4.4088,0.006,0.0406,0.9166,3.189,1.5124,1.8559,0.6602,3.7666,3.4392,3.126,4.2645,4.5586,0.0087,2.5477,7.2179,0.01,1.0297,1.3333,4.6284,3.8788,5.4662,4.8602,1.8345,0.0049,5.0266,0.7693,1.5148,3.3207,4.2429,7.9447,1.0323,3.7143,4.3859,2.6955,2.0419,2.8638,3.3544,0.3651,4.6429,0.6141,3.4852,1.1597,3.9734,0.1253,1.5179,6.1503,0.6886,0.6672,3.6162,0.8453,9.5026,0.3803,0.8903,4.0034,0.4178,5.3965,0.0518,5.5226,0.6757,0.5676,1.4813,4.7195,9.1717,4.9752,3.0315,0.7044,4.5637,0.9064,1.2635,0.4555,0.156,0.579,1.7722,1.3364,4.7383,1.2304,0.0718,1.2143,3.9809,0.6208,0.1936,0.6582,2.5536,3.668,0.2901,6.9431,0.0046,0.0294,1.494,0.525,0.8877,2.3151,1.3808,2.9285,0.0019,0.4483,0.2597,0.7862,1.7084,4.8756,5.7511,1.1934,0.5011,0.4219,2.7139,1.3525,2.372,4.7612,0.2972,0.7862,0.2178,0.5285,0.6733,5.6613,1.0459,0.1979,1.7905,4.4244,2.2049,5.1153,0.9457,4.4826,3.3914,0.3734,7.3433,5.9948,0.8922,4.5323,0.7102,7.5396,1.4522,0.3447,5.051,2.019,3.1211,0.0855,6.1419,3.9736,2.9771,2.3615,1.1943,3.403,5.8563,3.3995,3.238,0.6435,3.715,3.0432,0.3091,6.7399,0.9182,3.9721,0.0876,2.6921,4.3418,9.9733,1.3884,1.0971,0.5622,7.515,3.2885,0.94,1.6898,3.6274,0.7474,2.9177,2.3252,0.6879,0.2124,1.1129,1.1444,1.3829,3.6633,1.4004,0.3904,0.7632,3.7318,2.2854,1.7767,6.1375,0.1989,4.5951,1.1465,0.1761,1.9696,5.2068,3.8234,0.7441,0.8124,0.3486,2.5829,2.1637,5.0897,1.7609,0.8723,0.0867,2.6423,6.7513,1.414,5.2971,2.6708,1.5668,0.8265,1.9801,3.7427,3.4783,8.439,1.8052,6.9963,5.2199,0.4497,2.088,2.2284,1.7847,4.1464,3.3543,3.1798,2.6148,2.4832,3.7966,4.8625,5.7426,1.7736,5.4596,3.7266,0.0896,1.9054,1.4703,2.1133,6.042,2.2032,5.3654,1.465,0.4406,4.5517,1.7036,5.3676,1.4613,3.8787,5.0015,0.0323,0.6105,1.8741,2.2463,3.205,3.63,7.2744,6.2816,1.8877,4.9873,0.5384,4.7537,1.3705,2.9417,0.3018,1.0374,1.9743,3.9334,2.5975,6.7085,6.9837,4.0328,3.3719,2.2458,0.9959,6.3847,3.3083,3.8798,4.7767,6.0395,1.9226,0.1622,0.1152,2.8924,0.4573,3.9507,3.5915,1.8277,4.011,1.0945,5.0395,6.7662,0.9384,0.1397,4.7462,1.8739,1.3467,1.9061,3.8435,1.4601,0.4187,1.1414,0.8569,1.9995,3.2699,1.1454,6.4552,2.0555,2.9753,3.1492,0.4962,5.5656,1.7858,2.3437,1.6824,0.4302,2.7709,2.7361,2.3179,2.6554,0.2521,5.1097,2.3459,2.5373,2.8001,5.5438,0.1152,2.9019,2.9259,4.5728,1.7657,3.5681,5.2407,3.8996,2.5702,1.5704,2.1761,0.9912,5.9657,4.2652,0.7584,3.6471,7.1421,3.2005,1.611,0.3263,2.6814,2.0204,1.8326,0.2193,5.348,1.4933,3.7849,4.1424,3.2863,6.0067,1.133,0.4749,3.3518,3.1278,3.4024,5.6972,2.9328,5.0273,3.2183,3.16,0.4299,0.0229,4.6924,0.5625,1.1535,2.5442,0.2594]}

On","text":"Red Headed Stranger reached number one on the Billboard chart for Top Country Albums, and number 28 during a 43 @ - @ week stay in the Top LPs & Tapes chart. On the contemporary country charts from November 5,, the song topped the charts for five consecutive weeks, until it was finally displaced by the hit song, \"Home.\".\nIt has been a challenging year on every front. In the midst of the pandemic, an unhinged Donald Trump and ongoing divisive politics, and the effects on the economy, we have the need to remain vigilant. For those of us living through 2020, it\u2019s difficult to remember that it has been 100 years in recent history since our country began to build its modern healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act has undoubtedly saved countless lives across the country, improved the access to healthcare throughout the U.S., and provided some of the best healthcare in the world. The ACA has also caused significant challenges and issues for both companies and consumer\u2019s, and there are those who believe that the legislation has contributed to the opioid epidemic.\nThe opioid epidemic has claimed its toll in the United States. The national health statistics indicate that over 50.6 million Americans have used opioids in some capacity; however, it must be considered that only a small percentage of people experience long-term addiction. In 2017, there were 1.6 million deaths in the United States attributed to marijuana or opioids. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in 2017 there were 25,500 deaths due to opioid overdoses, and in 2016 there were 21,000. The opioid epidemic has resulted in nearly one million fewer Americans dying in the United States in a year compared to 2014.\nThe impact on the environment is equally as impactful. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 7 billion gallons of water are wasted globally each day due to over consumption of energy. The average household uses about 16,000 gallons of water per year and over 1,000 kWh per year for energy consumption. With both the environmental and health consequences of the opioid epidemic, individuals in recovery have been looking for alternatives to take control of their lives. Many individuals are considering ways to take on their lives, rather than relying on the addict in their lives. It has been suggested by several advocates that the first step to recovery is the beginning of healthy lifestyles.\nA number of individuals in recovery have been creating healthy recipes and products designed to encourage individuals in recovery to live a life not dependent on drugs or alcohol. Healthy Living Solutions is one such organization that has a number of individuals, in recovery, who have created natural alternative options to aid in the journey towards living a healthy lifestyle. One such example is Jason Tilley who has a blog entitled \u201cHimalayan Herbal Tea Recipes.\u201d","token_len":568,"entropy":[7.9,1.4239,8.476,11.8243,9.3156,2.5072,1.2008,0.9612,2.4444,4.7505,2.143,6.3884,3.4234,0.7086,0.0776,2.0358,1.8252,6.1477,10.3755,8.212,2.8656,8.6305,14.646,7.6988,7.6258,4.8507,8.6949,1.867,0.8526,1.4738,10.9311,1.368,5.4852,5.6089,4.2869,1.3193,0.5872,4.5395,1.6887,10.779,5.439,2.0394,6.1085,4.7345,4.0796,12.0446,3.0674,3.1401,4.4553,0.6399,2.0053,1.0351,4.7518,1.1861,0.2792,1.426,6.5233,2.0595,1.3019,4.0838,5.9415,0.5265,1.5425,4.4455,1.8774,2.4095,0.6615,6.5158,2.2212,8.4055,1.8755,10.1183,3.3715,1.2281,2.0336,5.4815,2.2054,5.6066,6.0085,3.2125,1.2869,3.0649,1.8706,3.5702,0.0013,1.4848,9.7033,0.1073,1.3749,5.0632,4.8257,3.1473,0.0006,4.6678,0.0533,3.1837,7.7826,6.4122,2.4702,1.1946,3.7045,1.753,6.525,3.7412,1.316,2.6623,0.5632,3.2727,2.1255,3.7118,5.2968,0.8,6.2512,0.4378,1.2551,4.9265,2.8343,1.0999,0.6462,4.0915,3.4731,8.6376,0.2431,2.3846,17.2255,8.5122,1.3227,5.5834,0.1908,4.804,2.0525,3.5362,2.8125,0.7028,5.936,0.319,4.8105,5.0982,1.546,2.2118,3.9162,1.5261,3.7047,1.4396,5.7941,2.3142,6.2846,6.7384,0.1692,0.552,2.8939,3.5801,0.0055,0.0009,2.1357,8.0514,3.7129,2.7259,0.1373,4.8899,0.6032,0.5423,0.7148,7.826,1.8324,7.4111,0.5767,1.9371,6.1274,0.45,4.025,0.0006,0.0007,0.1444,0.3118,2.8799,4.8078,1.2488,0.2029,1.4715,1.44,1.2516,0.175,0.5617,0.4744,2.6929,3.4563,1.0337,1.7909,5.3611,3.2219,5.45,3.5623,4.804,1.2175,4.3915,6.6641,0.1183,6.642,9.6432,0.8896,0.0654,1.8745,1.4859,4.8719,1.281,5.1872,0.5075,2.2536,0.5264,1.5522,5.8904,2.1725,4.0971,0.1118,0.9502,4.8412,0.3579,1.1024,1.8573,2.3661,5.4274,0.358,1.248,6.1241,6.4642,1.8215,2.7182,1.1878,1.1776,0.0017,1.5913,2.0516,5.8125,2.186,6.0231,3.2394,0.163,3.0399,3.3605,4.4326,1.923,0.1389,0.7719,1.2187,3.5567,1.6086,1.1388,4.4962,4.9934,5.1121,4.045,0.0618,2.9922,6.1478,0.191,4.5348,0.393,3.2646,2.4208,0.7275,0.9712,0.1746,2.7898,4.9697,6.0395,0.3942,0.0557,3.5006,0.9993,2.9065,4.447,0.1691,2.5046,0.4781,2.9018,0.5618,2.5612,0.1489,2.4909,2.3804,0.2913,0.5762,0.0013,6.9513,0.0383,6.8254,5.0245,3.9007,1.3094,3.7554,0.0034,0.641,4.2536,0.0032,0.5529,0.0697,0.0017,0.0051,0.2897,3.7738,1.2901,2.5034,0.1323,5.3876,0.7874,4.2961,2.2881,1.7888,0.0053,1.9486,1.5454,1.5852,1.5208,2.7375,1.0737,0.4178,0.0294,4.2558,0.0155,1.5277,2.4714,2.1835,2.7186,0.4546,1.22,3.3067,0.0409,4.0777,3.835,0.837,3.4469,1.8907,2.7512,2.6483,0.9173,0.8071,0.0012,2.6603,4.269,0.8792,4.1246,0.0864,4.0782,0.5297,1.1511,1.9268,5.6577,2.0026,1.0392,3.1121,1.4627,5.6411,2.3079,5.9477,0.0156,0.8042,3.1876,0.0011,0.5593,2.7854,0.0009,0.0327,0.0089,0.9594,0.0007,0.0045,0.2877,6.7325,4.4464,1.6301,0.0718,1.3625,1.2354,2.223,6.3477,0.8915,4.2109,2.3316,0.0053,3.3595,6.8172,0.3512,5.0932,1.6875,1.9436,4.4552,3.9732,2.8541,2.7161,4.5259,1.925,0.3713,0.278,0.2714,0.4861,1.1266,1.3861,3.5253,3.9116,2.793,0.9204,0.7415,6.8247,2.0564,0.2947,3.512,2.1796,1.5102,0.2769,4.8818,5.7238,1.9585,4.7446,0.356,1.9173,2.3116,0.3726,1.7418,1.6275,0.2555,0.7736,6.16,3.5791,6.9865,3.8524,2.1704,5.8132,0.4893,2.6204,0.7783,5.9915,3.728,0.196,0.2141,1.5909,0.5056,4.2067,2.7893,1.4424,4.514,4.5306,0.2314,3.3048,3.9158,2.9031,3.3454,1.8776,5.0402,0.0046,3.0286,0.2045,2.0381,7.676,4.6869,2.2581,1.7508,0.468,3.7149,2.4944,0.5188,3.428,3.2932,4.1049,5.5205,0.54,2.0334,5.1688,0.3422,1.3433,2.2848,0.6624,3.9152,4.88,0.0631,6.0593,4.2525,0.8772,1.3836,3.8555,3.181,0.0399,3.1714,3.264,0.1434,0.8333,2.2912,6.7766,3.3742,7.5949,1.5498,4.5608,6.2138,0.3154,6.0945,4.1474,4.1465,0.127,0.1801,4.3605,1.6486,3.3887,6.7188,3.248,0.1626,2.4874,1.2226,0.0961,0.2485,5.2392,4.0994,5.0593,1.9237,3.3041,0.7748,3.8237,1.479,1.3654,5.0573,4.2034,0.0041,5.2167,4.6437,3.988,0.643,0.4472,1.2678,1.1804,2.4924,7.4914,5.452,5.0531,1.1139,6.7215,1.2247,1.7809,4.9073,2.6545,5.7722,0.525,0.5181,1.362,0.1514,4.7826,0.8934,3.4871,0.5865,8.0632,8.6779,0.8296,2.9231,1.293,4.263,5.0958,4.4204,9.9211,5.894,5.188,6.4057,0.2921,8.7083,0.4332,4.046,3.3182,2.9116,7.3037,6.834]}

He wanted to","text":"Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience. He wanted to make it, as he states in his autobiography, to be the greatest aviator that the world has ever known, and he wanted as many as possible to fly in one way or another.\nThis is what Fossett envisioned. He had this idea to build an airport where a huge part of it is filled with balloons. He wanted to put balloons right into the air, and then he wants to do what you do on a mountain. So, he wanted to raise the ground level, level out the whole mountain, and to take on the air. He wanted some of those balloons to float and float. These were huge airships and enormous spaceships. There was one kind of balloon that was really a big balloon, and it would actually float quite high and float quite far. You would see them going into a balloon like that, and in fact, I saw them being built.\nBut what kind of plane they would use, well, for a plane, you needed a gas-powered two-cylinder engine, and you needed a lot of speed. I don't know that I'm going to find any in there. There might have been an engine, but they might have used rocket fuel.\nSo, I don't think they took off with something. But there were some balloons. I think they went up in a kind of plane that would have flown by the time I made the picture.\nAnd I think there was a plane that flew from California to California. The other person was in California at the time, and this is the little film. In the little film in the film, I can't read it. This is a lot of the stuff, but in English, a man is talking about planes flying from California to California. Well, that must have been a balloon.\nBut they could have used a plane if they wanted. So, one person actually started a company to build airships, and another person did some balloons and some airships around. They did a lot of experiments with airships and how they were built, and how they could fly.\nSo, I think there must have been a big experiment. There were companies... Oh, there was a company in North Carolina that did airships. They were in charge of them. They said that they had some balloons flying, but they had to go around and try them out in their different forms. And so they had to start taking apart all these airships to see what was in them, and trying different things, and putting new stuff in them, so that they could fly. It's all a big, big picture.","token_len":568,"entropy":[12.0223,3.6879,4.1774,6.8418,1.4252,0.8639,0.5241,7.852,5.8136,2.3219,9.8763,1.2892,9.7768,1.3133,6.1695,0.0516,0.6153,6.3687,0.1267,0.6182,1.2246,7.5131,3.2707,0.4938,1.2882,1.3275,3.3643,5.2485,0.0163,4.3065,7.3107,7.7037,3.8319,0.7157,1.8986,1.3279,7.0818,0.1414,2.9586,2.9606,4.2375,4.2793,1.3604,7.2187,1.1772,0.5,1.8505,0.3996,2.0076,1.9071,1.6474,2.4959,3.283,0.0095,4.3089,2.925,0.2713,0.4774,0.0634,0.6657,2.5998,1.2088,1.501,2.3798,7.3223,0.8924,3.2653,0.9041,0.2688,3.5314,2.8834,4.0887,4.0684,0.3525,0.0607,0.321,1.3926,9.0045,1.8255,2.6532,4.07,0.001,4.6556,2.0261,1.3996,3.1723,4.7252,2.2775,2.7522,2.6925,2.2417,5.6419,3.9135,4.2385,4.7273,5.8317,0.0065,4.705,3.5233,5.4096,0.1831,3.1896,1.276,1.6215,1.8475,0.6951,3.8692,4.0119,5.2047,2.6403,0.4835,1.8231,1.502,1.6569,2.5724,3.0022,6.2945,0.5112,3.185,4.3435,3.7365,2.0652,3.6401,1.3566,6.21,1.6148,3.1487,2.1719,1.0307,2.9728,0.3644,7.0539,1.4256,5.4473,1.1152,2.8657,6.2024,2.5302,0.7712,5.6492,4.7071,0.9388,0.7273,3.9483,4.3951,4.5933,1.0848,3.0394,1.7631,1.6068,1.0704,6.0667,2.0589,3.0347,2.9809,1.2536,3.0908,3.5122,2.6549,3.1621,4.8463,1.2223,4.8694,4.7544,1.4813,2.5462,6.5958,6.3007,1.3836,0.9822,4.1479,0.9926,3.7105,4.8706,0.1619,1.3905,0.9973,1.8426,3.7789,3.9313,3.037,4.4964,1.2593,1.1649,0.9848,3.4217,5.3221,1.1625,6.5169,1.5406,2.6114,3.0733,2.3184,3.6071,0.771,4.3398,2.2112,1.7077,3.8493,4.2172,3.9759,2.2976,4.2382,4.9079,2.4872,1.2994,0.8723,5.1983,2.519,1.071,3.9312,3.3364,2.0261,4.9466,3.8574,2.2371,1.2797,4.1847,3.0781,4.7366,0.0049,5.5184,4.4812,1.0452,4.0124,2.0772,6.5002,0.2154,4.8586,2.3134,4.9507,1.7235,2.5682,9.4386,1.3435,9.8198,3.2647,0.525,7.5097,0.2043,4.5571,0.0032,0.8091,1.3761,0.9397,2.2417,1.1997,0.9013,3.1662,0.0649,6.1329,1.0706,3.6858,3.0457,0.0008,0.4312,3.0921,1.8604,3.8509,1.7596,0.0254,5.0045,2.5807,5.4238,5.303,1.4056,3.7348,5.118,2.9136,0.1634,3.7134,1.8917,1.8735,0.6716,3.2198,3.2883,0.7658,4.0072,6.9788,2.1796,0.9758,2.1948,1.7424,0.9102,2.4017,4.4166,0.0007,2.2544,2.5079,5.0633,2.5432,2.7889,5.9339,3.6544,2.9072,3.3,1.3676,1.8713,3.7909,2.7026,2.0303,1.5224,1.153,3.8635,2.1131,2.4601,2.2073,5.3188,0.0008,6.3817,1.9903,2.6869,1.4231,3.4526,4.5476,2.3436,1.343,1.9343,5.3534,1.8873,5.303,0.571,1.4207,2.4242,2.1228,1.1959,3.058,1.3522,1.1313,4.6507,0.9097,2.5308,4.9622,4.3653,0.4343,3.7183,1.5345,3.337,4.4117,5.7011,2.4717,2.8594,2.5833,3.6007,0.4051,0.0271,0.8181,0.5176,3.9286,2.4725,2.0276,5.4944,7.5945,3.6646,4.4172,1.5989,2.2362,0.7061,5.348,0.862,3.5518,0.6537,2.2242,3.3077,1.7457,4.9702,1.8473,1.2514,4.0817,0.5254,2.2056,5.0254,0.3883,3.362,2.7647,4.1711,0.882,3.2783,8.4938,0.8889,5.0145,6.0415,2.7073,3.2648,0.8491,6.1569,2.4483,2.4965,0.5062,0.1934,0.2225,0.6994,5.2782,0.0284,2.8759,6.3144,1.0442,0.24,1.7581,4.2088,1.0934,1.1051,3.1782,3.9047,4.3506,0.931,2.1629,1.6146,4.99,5.812,0.3361,0.8863,1.619,2.9863,0.5885,4.6972,4.0941,5.6378,5.2783,3.4595,3.5283,2.7667,1.56,5.4237,0.2261,1.8698,0.5478,4.2527,0.5755,3.6355,3.0851,6.7139,1.9645,2.1462,2.9321,0.2044,7.4968,3.8408,2.6353,2.5509,1.7061,1.421,0.1025,3.9819,1.6574,3.1058,0.0653,1.7555,6.0484,0.6042,2.8263,2.8329,1.4322,0.523,4.2553,0.2569,2.1811,1.7679,0.8722,1.5457,1.7741,0.3699,1.7413,0.6814,2.2021,5.4607,0.0872,0.0176,1.0343,3.9704,5.3627,2.0109,2.9674,1.721,7.6131,9.3362,7.482,0.1748,2.2623,1.7146,0.8003,1.3504,2.9022,5.4591,0.6344,1.6116,1.9157,2.3878,0.1046,1.1128,1.4479,1.9476,3.9297,4.909,0.0814,4.2496,0.8403,1.2817,5.2308,3.3144,0.8307,2.1109,3.3308,3.199,4.0956,3.0547,1.8666,0.6394,1.9069,1.9975,3.2173,4.3832,1.6919,3.739,3.1022,2.5378,3.2586,3.7876,6.3133,4.943,0.4909,1.8185,2.5476,2.1539,2.1349,0.7324,4.7118,5.2473,6.0501,3.685,1.9745,3.6565,0.0551,3.7861,2.2268,0.9376,2.399,4.0576,0.3271,1.3343,0.4523,4.6918,3.0168,2.7252,2.1252,0.5081,4.9821,5.8415,3.1506,1.1941,1.289,1.4254,3.8633,0.9859,0.8342,0.407,1.1035,1.1896,4.0903,2.4526,3.5924,3.4641,2.5925,3.4377,0.483,4.7164,0.7001]}

The","text":"USS O 'Brien ( Destroyer No. 51 \/ DD @ - @ 51 ) was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and launched in July 1914. The ship was named for Edward J. O'Brien, 2nd USN, who was killed in action near the Battle of the Dog Islands in mid April 1918.\n\nCharacter\n\nUSS O'Brien was rated as a 2,200 gross ton (2,030\u00a0t) minehunter, with a working life of 5,000 nautical miles\u00a0(9,300\u00a0km; 5,500\u00a0mi).\n\n1914\u201315\n\nShe was ordered April 24, 1914, and completed October 13, 1915.\n\nWorld War I\n\nUSS O'Brien got underway May 10, 1915, and sailed to San Diego, California, for trials. After a few days, she was assigned to duty with the 5th Fleet, stationed at Pearl Harbor. She began that year as a training destroyer escorts for minesweepers off the Hawaiian Islands and the Western Pacific. She escorted the minesweepers USS\u00a0Yarmouth\u00a0(DD-625), USS\u00a0Nashwa\u00a0(DD-842), and USS\u00a0Dolphin\u00a0(DD-301), and conducted submarine training.\nShe departed Hawaii August 10, and in September, in company with  USS\u00a0Cato\u00a0(DD-226) and USS\u00a0Cressy\u00a0(DD-129), patrolled the coast of northern Australia. On 23 September, she was ordered to return to San Francisco, where the vessels of the 3rd Fleet were stationed. Shortly after her arrival, she sailed for the Eastern Pacific and made training cruises along the California coast until June 1916, when she sailed back to Hawaii and made training cruises there and the southern Pacific from 1917 to 1919.\nIn 1918, O'Brien served with the task force sent from San Francisco to the Far East. She was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 3, on the Western Pacific coast. She conducted patrols in the area around China and Japan which included cruises north along the Japanese coast, with stops in the Kurils Islands and south and east to Philippines. She operated off Vladivostok, Japan, for the first part of the campaign. From there, her mission and her itinerary were changed to more closely escort the minesweepers. They made a brief stop in Tsingtao, before sailing around Japan for the rest of the war; in particular, they participated in the Battle of Japan.

Seven former England internationals are also members of this Hall of Fame. Three other players are currently working with the England national team.\nThere were six players in total for the first English team to represent England against Wales in the 1966 World Cup : John Holland, Jack Greaves, Colin Gray, Jim Smith, Chris Sutton and Dave Richardson. Holland and Sutton then went on to win caps for the British Lions before Greaves returned to the Blues to play two tests against the French. Both Richardson and Gray were at half-back in the opening test at Twickenham in 1968.\nIn 1981 England went to West Indies for four Tests. After being beaten 4-0 at home, the team returned with an impressive victory for all who attended.\nSixteen players have competed for England's national junior rugby team. The first player to have scored a hat-trick was Colin Gray, in the 1965 Six Nations. A double hat-trick was scored by Brian Tufnell when he helped England to win the 1967 Six Nations.\nThe first Englishman to represent rugby union at the Olympics was Ray Brown, in London in 1908; he went on to play for Great Britain in 1908, 1912 and 1920 and for France in the 1916 Olympics, where he was selected as captain and joint-champion. Two other players also gained medals, but at the individual events : Tony Blackburn in 1928 and 1934, and John Brakewood in 1952.\nIt is widely believed that no player from England has played for the South African team. This is a lie, however, as the current captain of the England national rugby union team is a South African born, and plays for Northampton Saints. In the 2008 Rugby World Cup, the English were beaten at the quarterfinal stage after a scrum down in the last 13 minutes of the match, allowing South Africa to pass.\nIt was an international encounter between the All Blacks of New Zealand and the New Zealand All Stars of Great Britain. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the All Blacks won the game 30-12.\nThe 2006 Rugby World Cup took place in New Zealand. The All Blacks dominated the tournament, winning every game they played with the exception of the final against France. The only game won by a side other than New Zealand was France beating the English 26-22. The only other international match to see four different nation's teams was the 1993 Rugby World Cup match between Argentina and the All Blacks, won 32-20 by the All Blacks.\nThe British Lions and the All Blacks met in England in the summer of 1999 and in 2006. The Lions won both games 14\u20137 and 24\u201319 respectively.","token_len":570,"entropy":[7.9557,7.6721,8.4259,1.8204,2.0232,7.9841,0.002,0.1449,0.2149,4.4256,3.1715,0.4495,0.0136,0.0021,11.1815,5.9451,5.9709,0.7763,0.0129,0.5035,5.7989,3.9764,0.2654,5.9639,7.6449,1.4636,13.8581,3.1806,8.8537,0.5696,0.4099,6.8633,2.4042,1.7405,2.668,0.0145,2.5521,1.0277,4.9498,0.4973,3.2812,2.7293,0.926,0.0152,0.7486,6.4271,3.2327,3.29,2.3899,4.3307,4.987,2.3769,0.7829,4.8284,4.2736,0.2383,1.3886,0.8609,9.7008,3.0085,4.6481,1.9565,2.7814,5.056,4.4041,0.6971,3.8339,7.97,2.5653,0.6002,3.7006,1.9646,4.492,3.783,0.9628,0.7769,5.841,0.3918,0.0399,5.5018,4.4635,7.5103,0.2231,4.38,6.9401,1.9057,0.2528,6.0368,6.0793,0.5576,5.1271,5.5288,0.6767,5.0185,5.3002,0.8092,4.5928,6.1413,0.1306,6.7066,2.4425,4.9617,6.4094,2.5544,0.3649,0.0315,2.5947,7.2256,0.6462,1.7192,3.9589,4.434,4.7893,9.7712,0.0006,3.8844,0.1593,1.5246,8.1014,2.5144,1.5365,5.4601,8.2113,2.6262,2.2055,4.2678,1.4389,4.2413,6.3151,0.0319,2.6993,1.1397,5.006,6.7494,0.2237,1.3977,2.2277,1.162,4.6392,5.0026,3.9622,3.1706,0.0008,0.0,1.8323,3.385,0.9137,0.9565,2.7735,5.0666,1.9491,3.9195,1.4898,6.5204,0.3035,1.1467,4.6951,0.8699,2.0502,3.9724,3.6044,2.6686,3.3764,0.0165,1.0814,2.7475,1.5605,2.5597,2.0523,3.3864,2.7217,5.3393,2.7493,3.0769,2.5531,4.9413,6.7914,6.2185,3.2291,1.1149,1.7822,6.0861,3.3846,1.2345,1.9657,5.2708,1.1065,0.9642,3.2562,2.2674,9.3618,4.9282,0.5289,1.9143,2.6572,3.2675,3.193,0.7738,3.8467,5.3001,1.3879,2.6521,0.2549,0.0,0.0002,1.6824,5.9489,2.4093,1.2333,4.3746,3.0534,5.3871,4.1429,0.005,1.2894,4.3195,6.5285,3.0406,0.0484,0.006,0.0003,1.7893,2.4583,0.7428,5.0766,5.0928,5.6935,0.6685,4.5086,0.9554,4.6393,0.9454,1.352,4.6585,0.5131,3.2507,0.9393,0.0015,0.7631,1.0338,2.1413,2.7788,3.0634,5.1358,0.1621,3.6114,6.4028,1.8934,2.0087,0.8887,3.3961,0.4822,5.4015,4.7537,1.0568,1.0311,6.2695,0.5268,7.257,6.9626,1.8301,3.4004,0.0826,0.003,1.3677,1.2125,5.4052,0.0107,1.167,4.0854,2.323,4.094,0.5224,3.7396,2.9567,3.9626,3.7265,0.2399,4.532,4.699,1.3432,3.0297,2.7438,0.1,2.1727,3.3373,1.4586,2.4593,3.1755,9.7478,2.2901,5.396,0.0556,0.4783,5.3832,1.4468,1.3546,4.3161,7.2096,1.8094,3.4725,3.8424,6.4753,0.7738,8.4224,5.3685,10.062,5.5752,7.1655,3.4111,4.2808,0.6803,11.1742,1.2927,1.6049,3.9431,8.2612,1.6454,6.9508,0.2298,4.9629,0.4952,0.5713,4.7732,1.204,4.089,0.5279,0.1244,6.0843,2.0061,2.5841,1.3345,1.0435,2.3141,2.161,1.6349,5.5479,0.4197,2.3179,2.5329,3.6233,1.1933,2.8484,6.3969,1.2158,1.9362,0.4023,0.9156,1.7421,5.1754,3.1583,1.727,0.5065,3.7719,1.8377,3.2514,5.1347,0.1651,1.6223,3.0988,2.6363,0.0433,3.4273,3.2253,3.0601,6.1083,0.5402,6.2061,2.1178,2.4866,0.7903,3.2649,2.4122,5.3243,2.0562,0.3241,0.0331,0.9239,1.938,4.3325,3.2526,2.2964,4.5298,2.3239,5.6218,4.5128,2.032,5.7162,1.8636,4.8059,0.0364,8.7939,3.4489,0.6798,4.1088,5.943,0.3746,1.8552,0.5078,2.7823,1.9349,5.1476,2.637,0.1077,0.2779,6.7129,1.9112,0.9252,3.9382,1.4627,4.3069,4.3596,7.6154,2.2673,1.4137,5.8728,0.0121,5.6981,3.4372,0.1373,0.1532,1.3399,3.0751,0.0454,2.017,6.3015,2.3131,5.0017,0.0022,1.773,3.1386,0.854,6.3871,1.2121,0.0142,0.0027,0.4982,1.1207,0.5749,0.0121,2.3052,1.1225,2.9238,6.3024,0.0556,3.3899,1.1368,1.0425,1.6979,5.105,1.1943,0.0216,0.0045,4.2642,0.1218,0.4718,3.7331,0.1224,1.1522,1.3954,0.8571,0.0035,4.9864,0.7793,4.907,1.1894,1.999,4.7732,1.3785,3.0271,0.5091,4.258,2.8932,4.1012,0.0463,1.4643,2.0098,5.7695,4.202,0.6548,1.6705,4.7088,4.1084,5.0696,0.5578,3.243,3.4337,2.8895,0.0024,1.6226,0.0083,0.5433,6.2881,8.3203,1.2142,6.1909,4.7141,0.0049,4.1153,1.2757,2.0465,4.0976,1.6692,4.4023,1.7747,2.9144,3.8252,6.7247,3.4892,6.5785,2.2294,2.6416,3.4772,1.2455,5.8922,1.1574,0.0308,0.0036,4.8027,0.4918,4.3114,0.1544,2.2955,1.9424,0.0069,1.8919,5.3231,6.2183,0.0098,2.4525,2.0704,1.1795,0.3657,0.0102,0.3308,0.5506,1.3935,5.716,3.5689,3.8385,1.8311,0.883,0.0069,4.9656,0.8053,5.2331,0.8909,1.6324,6.3213,0.066,3.7322,2.5482,3.8372,3.8847,3.0122,1.302,1.1101,0.9616,4.2497,1.4342,6.3047,6.9016,2.6185,2.5752,6.5353,0.2401,3.1743,3.7135,0.2905]}

He thought it must be a forgery and refused to comment. In early 1943 he was asked for an opinion by his own colleagues at Chicago. Compton himself described to the group his own astonishment over the discovery. It is ironic that the man who had so little faith in the discovery, in spite of his own experience, was to play a major role in its dissemination. Meanwhile, the Manhattan Project had to work hard in trying to keep its secrets from other scientists, who were keen to be informed of the discovery of plutonium. They would have been able to test, through collaboration with Compton, what he had done to verify that his calculations were correct.\nDuring World War II, Compton led a joint team of physicists and chemists who invented a new method of isotope separation. Called the beta-particle counter mass separator, it allowed the scientist to study the reactions of neutrons with matter with much greater sensitivity than was previously possible. The machine developed at Oak Ridge gave more information than had been available to the scientists who carried out the Enrico Fermi experiment ten years earlier.\nThe development of the beta-particle counter mass separator, in the early 1940s, had a major impact on nuclear physics research. By measuring the reactions of neutrons with a few atoms, the machine could measure the chemical composition of nuclear reactors and determine whether they were operating normally.\nCompton became head of the Oak Ridge Plant in 1940. He helped to establish the world's first nuclear power plant, the Oak Ridge Atomic Plant, with its huge capacity to generate electricity. He left Oak Ridge in 1951 to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. Later that year he was appointed president of the California Institute of Technology, a position he held for 21 years. Although he had no financial benefit from these posts, he spent his personal wealth to found the Compton Laboratory at Caltech. The structure of the Compton Laboratory was entirely new, built at once on the land gifted to Caltech and financed by endowments.\nHe left Caltech in 1966, returning to Oak Ridge, where he worked for a few months while his wife, Dorothy, was ill. This period would be the last time he worked at Oak Ridge.\nWally Compton was also an artist. He used his art as a therapy during World War II, particularly for the sufferers of shell-shock. Wally Compton was a man of exceptional brilliance and genius. He had a remarkable ability to grasp complex scientific ideas in a few moments. His style of communication was highly effective, using humour and anecdote to add pleasure to an otherwise tedious scientific discussion.

{"prompt":"After Gasketball 's 2012 release , Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria , British Columbia .

The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used that time to put together a much more polished remake of the game, with the addition of a multiplayer mode and a much more modern, pixelated and updated graphical style.\nAt this point, some of the music for the game was completely changed, and as a result Boxleiter decided to make a full musical composition, instead of just the score. The music for the game was composed by Chris Mangan, and the sound effects by Peter Mangan and Dustin Wohlwend. The game was released under the code name Boxleiter by Steamworks on March 29, 2012.\nBoxleiter received negative reviews throughout the year, resulting in a score of 7. In October 2012, Boxleiter received a rating of 5. It reached the top five on Steam's \"New and Noteworthy\" list, in the \"History and Criticism\" category. Boxleiter received five total stars on Metacritic.\nThe only positive review received by Boxleiter came from GamesRadar, who gave the game 3. The review further stated : \"The odd, repetitive, and dull story is the biggest issue with the game, although there are enough features to make the game stand out. But most of the time, it feels like you're going to an old friends' house to play catch-up.\nThere is an awful lot going on during games, so if you want to see the same game play time over and over again, Boxleiter really is for you.\" A more positive review, however, came from Steamworks, who declared Boxleiter a \"4 out of 5 star hit with lots to do after each game\".\nBoxleiter received awards and nominations. As stated on Steam's website, the game was named one of Steam's \"30 Greatest Games of a Year\" in the \"Indie-Show\" category.\nIt was nominated in the \"Best Independent Game - Early Access\" category in the 2014 Gamelab Awards, and in the \"Best Indie Games\" category at the Indie Next and VGX showcases. In June 2011, the sound design for Boxleiter was nominate for \"Soundtrack of the Year\" at the 2011 UK Game Awards.\n^ \"Boxleiter's official site\". Steam.

{"prompt":"He completed a move to Football League Two side Exeter City in summer 2008 , signing for the first time for a club in the Football League . He made his first team debut in","text":"He completed a move to Football League Two side Exeter City in summer 2008, signing for the first time for a club in the Football League. He made his first team debut in the first round of the 2008\u201309 FA Cup against Accrington Stanley, coming on as a second-half substitute for Tony Adams. After the 2008\u201309 season, he was loaned out to fellow League Two club Grimsby Town and to fellow League One club Northampton Town during pre-season 2010, before making a \u00a3350,000 move to newly promoted Premier League club West Ham United in January 2010 in exchange for a free choice option of a new contract after a successful trial.\nHe made his Premier League debut for West Ham in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Liverpool on 24 January 2010 in which he was an unused substitute. He scored two goals in seven competitive games for West Ham in his first season at the club, both in a 3\u20132 victory against Stoke City in the League Cup at the Den. An injury in September 2010 forced a short-term departure from the team to recovery for the following two months. His debut as a starter also came during this period under coach Kevin Nolan.\nAfter a loan spell to the West Ham side Exeter City in the League, Cooper moved to League One club Notts County on a two-way transfer on 13 October 2012, in return for Chris Powell and Jack Cunningham as well as a new two-year contract. He made his debut for County three days later, starting in a 3\u20132 away victory over Bristol Rovers. He scored his first goal in a 1\u20135 loss against Cambridge United the following week.\nCooper spent the rest of the season on loan with his parent club Leeds United from Notts. He left the club when he signed for League Two club AFC Bournemouth in 2015.\n\nLeicester City\n\nOn 30 July 2015, Cooper signed a two-year deal to join Championship club Leicester City on a free transfer. He made his debut that same day, captaining the side in a Championship play-off win over West Bromwich Albion.\nAfter his first season at the club, Cooper failed to attract the attention of first-team managers Michael O'Neill and Wes Brown and subsequently left in the summer of 2018.\n\nRacing Club de Avellaneda\n\nOn 25 July 2018, Cooper moved to the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Racing Club de Avellaneda.

The NAACP redoubled their efforts in 1947 after the Civil Rights Act was passed.\nThe NAACP opposed the Civil Rights Act. Even the name of the law, passed in 1960, is controversial because it calls for full equality. However, in its implementation the Constitution is violated.\nHistorian Richard J. Evans wrote in an article titled \u2018The NAACP is a Party and the Party: A View in History\u2019, that the NAACP began as a political organization. In fact, the first meeting of the organization was held in July of 1909 and the first president of the organization.\nAfter World War II, the Communist Party of the united States was formed out of the defections of the Black Panther Party and World War II veterans. The communist party of the USA is a minority organization of the party.\nCommunist Party of America\nThe Communist Party of America was founded in 1920. The founder of the party was the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in fact, was a former Communist Party of America. In the 1920 election, the Communist Party of the USA won less than 1% of the vote. In fact, the Black Panther Party won more votes. It is thought that the party lost influence during the 1950s and 1970s.\nThe Black National Liberation League was founded in 1937 as a political organization in an attempt to counteract the Communist Party of the USA. The two organizations often faced off and were on opposite sides of the political spectrum.\nThe term Black Bloc was used by the Black National Liberation League to describe the violence committed by members of the Black National Liberation League. The violent nature of the Black Bloc was seen by the Black National Liberation League, which is a political organization not a militia. The Black Bloc was not made up of Black Panthers and members of the Black National Liberation League. Members of the Black Block were not necessarily members of the NLA.\nOn January 16, 1969, a major confrontation between the National Liberation Movement and the Black Panthers took place at a university in California. The student protesters were called the Black Panthers. There were reports of violence and vandalism and students were arrested.\nThe confrontation made the Black Panthers look violent and led to a decrease in donations. It is thought that the Black Liberate movement was more interested in gaining political rights for the black community than political violence.\nThe Democratic Black Congress was formed in 1984.

{"prompt":"Since any irrational number can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers , exponentiation of a positive real number b with an arbitrary real exponent x can be defined by continuity","text":"Since any irrational number can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers, exponentiation of a positive real number b with an arbitrary real exponent x can be defined by continuity as\nFor the sequence of rational numbers, the sequence of exponents is not unique, however, if we call the sequence of exponents, then it could be equivalently defined as the sequence of exponents. It is to be noted here that, which is the sequence of exponents in a similar manner\nHere, the sequence of real numbers ( ) has been used. \nAs the sequence of rational numbers tend to zero, therefore, the corresponding sequence of exponents tends to zero ( ), too. Similarly, it can be proved that when the sequence of real numbers tends to zero, the sequence of exponents ( ) also tends to zero.\nThe fact that each rational number can be expressed by its corresponding infinite series of rational numbers in the form of (1) or (2) leads to the conclusion that there is no need for the concept of a convergence measure to quantify the quality of approximation of an arbitrary real number by an arbitrary rational number. Therefore, we have shown that the exponential function can be expressed in a mathematical manner using rational numbers, instead of complex numbers, thereby eliminating the concept of convergence measure.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nIt is to be reiterated that the reason for using complex numbers is not, as such, because the concept of convergence measure has been defined to approximate with as small a deviation as possible, however, it is true, therefore, that rational numbers, instead of complex numbers, have been used as they can be expressed using the concept of convergency measure and the corresponding infinite series of rational numbers. It is also to be noted that the use of the concept of convergence measure has been shown to be valid for the exponential function to be used in the representation of the exponential function as the rational number. It can be deduced also that if an arbitrary real number can be approximated using a sequence of real numbers without any convergence measure, then the corresponding approximation of this arbitrary real number will also be an arbitrary real number but with some error in it. Therefore, it can be said that the fact why we are using the expression for the exponential function is because, we are expressing the exponential function as the rational number and therefore, it can be represented by the concept of convergency measure. Therefore, it can be concluded from our discussions that there is no need for the concept of convergence measure to quantify the quality of approximation of any given real number by any rational number and the use of complex numbers or exponential series has been shown to be correct only for a purpose. We believe that the use of rational numbers and the concept of convergency measure are more suitable than any other concept to express any given real number for an arbitrary purpose in quantum mechanics.","token_len":576,"entropy":[6.3185,11.7656,6.3004,2.0315,0.586,3.6683,1.3402,2.3974,7.8398,0.543,1.5274,6.8748,0.7848,4.8125,0.413,0.4391,9.1259,0.1094,2.0474,1.5178,4.899,6.0802,0.3774,8.3077,5.0963,3.0842,4.0751,3.4429,5.4365,5.029,1.6864,0.359,4.0509,2.6787,11.1629,4.15,3.6438,10.8692,2.2265,5.11,0.6121,0.7569,0.0705,1.607,1.5905,3.3902,0.3196,6.0173,0.0626,2.1346,4.6581,6.1929,1.653,4.9987,0.7697,4.0045,2.4816,5.8353,1.3066,0.9387,0.3574,2.0827,0.014,4.7313,2.4357,2.5621,5.0104,0.2812,6.8058,0.1421,2.4517,0.4422,1.7065,0.8301,0.0275,2.1149,0.0206,2.6369,4.2566,0.6293,5.1917,0.2752,1.1851,3.5716,0.086,3.2515,7.501,0.7805,2.4674,4.246,0.0979,1.1089,0.0113,2.8801,2.4194,8.2355,1.9871,8.0632,5.1975,1.942,1.3799,1.5528,0.1536,4.0571,0.4954,3.7566,6.3711,3.9436,2.7244,3.87,3.6824,7.5275,6.2871,4.0328,2.9491,1.6369,0.0914,2.1447,0.0141,10.5219,0.0964,9.6194,1.1137,5.4948,0.4394,1.4206,7.0429,1.0181,0.2269,1.328,0.0054,5.9615,0.0408,2.6578,3.1074,4.3746,6.2747,0.2991,5.6344,0.1501,3.6048,2.2908,0.2107,5.1396,0.2991,4.7467,1.7007,0.742,0.067,1.1614,0.0161,6.2139,0.0288,0.9082,0.3151,1.5561,1.1832,0.0246,0.1856,0.0023,3.3479,0.425,3.308,0.2622,0.0053,0.08,0.9809,1.344,2.0619,4.2075,0.1332,5.1794,1.2399,0.1125,2.4015,0.4447,1.1495,2.835,3.5465,3.9127,8.4723,2.0573,0.9368,1.6999,0.0859,4.3417,1.7168,3.105,0.6296,4.0816,2.8348,2.6798,2.1441,0.0911,0.2392,0.2073,6.1982,0.47,0.5726,2.7169,0.0627,2.6832,0.9191,1.3262,4.8558,0.9295,2.3805,6.1776,0.1335,2.178,8.9482,8.215,2.3284,6.9775,0.7381,5.827,0.0732,7.9727,2.5704,3.0102,3.4744,0.8147,0.1914,4.3369,3.1903,0.3983,3.7702,0.0415,0.3984,4.4431,0.1584,2.853,2.9168,3.7329,0.3423,1.4381,6.7226,2.4707,2.6995,0.1971,1.7935,1.8115,2.7888,4.3747,2.9423,2.5437,5.7041,0.1365,2.3222,5.503,0.0539,6.4761,1.6838,2.0214,6.2565,4.1047,0.2619,5.4454,0.0179,1.6182,4.4165,0.4015,0.6287,7.563,0.2183,5.6988,0.0809,0.3061,0.2759,3.7347,0.7422,3.8791,0.1339,7.7053,0.2216,1.1327,6.4665,1.3376,2.5516,5.6932,0.1833,1.4134,1.6033,5.5837,0.9768,3.4615,0.0745,2.2449,2.0882,4.8259,0.0949,0.3574,0.487,2.3992,0.7522,4.7273,4.2018,7.1762,7.5109,6.08,3.9702,0.6283,6.209,1.2238,0.0949,1.7712,4.2794,0.2784,1.5263,0.4513,5.1891,4.3014,5.6189,0.0399,0.0423,6.2152,0.0432,3.4393,5.5051,0.0105,4.7462,0.0446,0.1141,2.4365,2.0035,1.859,2.0075,6.2466,4.674,0.3084,1.5841,2.8086,2.1902,3.2032,0.0554,3.9162,7.4868,1.8913,3.8086,2.5121,5.5733,3.6683,0.0261,0.1276,0.58,0.0111,0.4286,3.3804,0.3454,1.5864,0.9605,0.0025,0.4953,0.118,1.3142,3.9022,0.0127,2.6937,1.602,0.0182,0.3839,0.0401,2.1621,0.8613,3.3823,0.1735,0.7813,5.3086,1.7979,2.2093,4.0246,0.3997,4.2965,0.7744,1.7906,1.5083,1.6681,6.4414,0.0856,1.9266,3.4523,0.3387,2.8453,2.8245,4.3669,0.548,1.6028,2.9118,3.1128,0.7763,6.6508,0.0013,5.4416,0.526,3.9403,3.7503,2.1947,0.7928,0.0828,2.0578,0.0963,5.4121,0.0021,1.6988,2.0011,5.5581,0.027,2.717,0.022,5.0044,1.6032,2.6509,0.962,0.3941,0.3552,1.0427,3.6513,6.4745,0.9318,3.7156,4.1351,0.0527,0.0112,2.935,3.5197,0.3305,5.2263,2.0385,0.1161,0.0169,6.8454,1.9308,3.8376,5.1851,2.9297,3.2139,0.4779,3.2326,0.118,2.0531,2.4533,0.161,3.4719,0.189,0.9174,4.2405,11.6657,2.7503,3.4961,1.048,1.0826,5.2237,4.1949,0.9089,1.6469,0.0929,1.9034,1.6723,3.0522,5.6808,1.803,5.0999,1.0758,2.3352,0.0758,1.8271,1.5087,1.3533,0.0608,2.6528,3.7992,1.4405,1.9198,1.3595,0.1293,4.373,2.1199,0.9196,4.6827,0.0245,1.4668,0.309,0.3408,0.6211,3.811,0.0981,1.6244,1.299,0.2311,3.1047,3.4805,3.4698,6.0354,1.1074,3.0025,0.493,0.3307,0.8677,0.5308,1.0968,0.4913,0.0063,0.3628,0.0161,0.9808,2.7909,0.3116,0.1414,0.0158,0.3471,0.2484,4.7622,4.1917,1.1039,0.0396,0.6346,1.715,2.157,0.0291,3.9612,3.0984,3.1171,0.021,2.633,0.0211,5.3439,4.0562,5.562,3.3854,0.6741,1.3225,0.0729,0.29,4.3992,6.0967,1.2238,2.8842,7.2972,2.3452,4.2703,3.913,0.3457,1.2299,1.8439,0.0036,4.3351,0.0388,2.5974,1.1872,3.4964,0.0049,1.0009,0.1154,0.0221,3.3858,5.137,3.492,2.4195,2.7145,0.3663,3.727,1.7317,3.0935,4.5906,3.5712,0.4,0.0393,4.5828,3.4939,0.5619,6.2054,3.7084,7.8361,0.8613,0.5945]}

Lowell's widow, who resided in Arizona, was so distraught that she had to be restrained, it was said.Lowell's father, Samuel, a leading lawyer, moved into the family home, the old home of the Druidas on the southern edge of what is now Phoenix, which he transformed into a laboratory to study the constellations of the Southern hemisphere under the leadership of Lowell. The Druida Society became active in the study of the stars through meetings conducted by Lowell in the family home. Lowell became a member of the Astro Club of the National Geographic Society. Lowell's research led to the conclusion that there is a planet between Mars and Jupiter, but Lowell's own theories were later refuted. Instead, he began a new career in astronomy and continued in that science until his death in 1930.In 1924 Lowell won a Pulitzer Prize for a short book that explained how his work was being used to solve a variety of problems related to the study of the stars. The book that he wrote with Edward A. Barnard and named ` ` A Planet Beyond the Stars ``. In 1924 Lowell moved to Chicago, where he served as a professor of astronomy at the University of Chicago. There he became one of the founders of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, a position he held until his retirement in 1933.In 1935 he went on a trip to Greece, where he took part as an observer for two months in the eclipse of Venus. Following this, he went on to spend five months in Florida to study the eclipse of the sun on August 28, 1936. During this time, the eclipse turned him into a media sensation.In 1940 Lowell published `` The Planets and Other Galaxies and Other Planets, `` in which he argued it is possible that the stars we see are actually vast clusters of light and not separate bodies as astronomers had thought for quite some time. In this book, he pointed out how astronomical observations have led him to believe that the stars are not isolated from us and that there are other stars near us, as he suggested there is another planet near the sun. His book published after the eclipse was a great success, and it led to Lowell's receiving the prestigious Carnegie Medal that year. The fact that the eclipse created such a furore caused Lowell to be considered by some as a heretic. His book in the same year was reprinted and translated into foreign languages.He was then chosen by the University of Chicago to be the chief astronomer for the new University Observatory. In 1951 Lowell donated his collection of celestial objects to the Smithsonian Institution. Lowell was made an emeritus professor by the University of Chicago in 1957. He later died in his Chicago home on October 19, 1961.","token_len":576,"entropy":[9.0719,2.4695,8.829,2.4141,2.8976,9.3768,9.5266,3.554,0.8908,7.2373,0.3118,12.8024,1.4493,0.9967,6.6986,4.146,0.3467,1.2232,1.4087,2.484,0.9947,8.2256,0.0009,4.6481,7.1635,0.1934,10.6451,13.7898,5.3297,1.743,9.0516,2.5601,8.8894,1.4694,4.5704,1.0537,3.6587,6.7046,0.4649,5.9988,0.3103,2.0817,4.0191,1.8472,1.1252,0.2434,3.1374,0.7422,2.4389,5.0772,3.8132,7.2951,1.0235,2.3627,0.9252,11.3587,0.0001,1.3046,3.7456,0.716,5.3753,2.2343,3.1576,6.6683,4.9572,1.0321,5.8164,3.2908,0.8728,2.2868,0.407,2.1679,4.3694,5.489,2.4718,1.0838,2.0819,9.1576,11.1515,5.4805,2.1125,4.9614,1.6525,0.0041,6.595,0.9318,0.0635,4.0606,1.2741,4.1741,3.3308,8.1689,0.1233,0.7281,5.8942,4.2696,1.5021,0.9,9.599,0.0446,0.0006,1.968,0.6915,5.7432,3.1703,7.5579,1.0949,3.4824,0.0107,3.8352,1.7451,2.6071,1.7828,6.1778,6.9673,4.5211,3.3479,0.6718,1.0588,5.1615,0.1839,1.0713,4.0225,5.9884,7.0022,6.3603,0.7467,0.5202,3.3647,1.3713,4.9717,0.6874,0.6968,0.9186,3.8976,1.8821,2.8894,0.1823,0.2984,9.1638,5.4407,1.497,1.7604,4.7031,3.6064,0.0448,1.641,1.1917,1.916,5.2191,3.1107,0.5094,0.7194,7.5744,0.0731,3.1717,2.1881,0.9836,2.9949,5.235,2.2906,0.0604,1.1701,1.4009,2.8714,2.6204,1.862,3.8173,3.7103,1.6356,4.4344,2.919,1.1311,6.9541,0.7188,2.0736,4.0794,3.2887,3.0284,3.1217,1.3095,0.7909,2.0993,4.7825,4.1469,3.3076,6.5219,1.7659,1.0535,0.0847,0.52,4.4926,0.2644,3.4328,5.5362,1.5205,7.0007,1.434,4.0027,0.0417,0.2575,4.477,4.69,4.5624,3.4082,5.0921,2.1496,4.0793,3.2039,2.5469,4.6954,0.8304,0.7942,4.109,2.8348,3.7897,0.0008,1.1568,4.2193,0.0031,0.8601,3.6633,0.0386,0.6491,2.3033,0.4731,2.1686,1.1522,6.4832,2.5329,1.3689,4.4468,6.3033,3.9757,0.0869,7.7758,0.4634,2.7342,7.8737,6.2004,8.8212,5.5241,8.2515,5.2665,1.3621,1.2678,6.8743,5.7089,3.5515,3.3583,0.4591,4.3889,0.3925,4.9992,1.4753,0.4535,0.1826,5.1582,0.2313,1.2386,1.84,0.3618,0.789,1.0853,0.5233,0.2253,0.0055,0.8051,0.7007,5.3232,0.795,3.0393,3.2887,0.0066,0.2229,3.5518,0.128,0.2139,4.182,0.4819,0.2161,0.5225,1.9337,4.8901,3.0606,1.7765,6.6957,1.1436,0.1636,0.4499,0.9036,2.4737,0.2741,3.9176,0.1833,2.703,2.9045,3.0083,4.7403,0.9312,2.6197,2.7248,0.1372,6.0118,1.5494,0.4764,0.1297,4.7341,0.8778,7.1956,1.845,1.8765,2.3068,3.769,2.7881,2.3569,0.7504,6.4966,0.4756,2.8258,0.6086,5.7966,2.2702,1.5105,0.638,3.7761,0.9472,1.1159,5.0726,3.9536,1.8609,1.1909,7.2644,5.2083,0.8063,0.585,2.3754,0.6294,1.6613,2.147,3.6323,2.6035,3.5168,0.3132,1.3601,0.3241,3.2561,0.9953,0.5298,1.7214,3.8759,1.6293,5.6695,6.0148,0.6253,0.5205,9.1761,2.2746,1.0555,3.8507,3.6092,0.3435,2.975,4.2622,1.7511,5.656,0.179,3.2987,4.053,7.5244,0.0002,3.5195,3.2003,4.2594,0.0013,3.2358,4.5195,2.05,0.7643,0.0667,3.9381,7.7581,3.1754,1.4547,1.6043,1.243,2.7033,4.4831,0.7996,1.624,3.1038,8.6292,4.3619,0.1107,4.7779,4.2525,3.7493,7.1156,5.3633,5.5169,3.6709,2.5752,1.331,6.0251,5.0403,0.3027,0.0143,0.1597,2.3623,2.7935,2.2879,1.3433,2.1536,5.0047,0.3253,2.8737,4.8541,1.6092,2.7766,3.5762,2.4057,0.0672,1.9226,0.2194,1.1014,1.5459,1.2833,2.218,3.9416,1.798,5.4636,1.9102,0.7545,2.5027,0.8395,2.1737,3.4632,6.5669,0.8242,2.1289,3.4118,2.7272,4.2071,5.6156,2.648,5.0621,2.3797,3.9817,2.7106,1.7183,0.8705,4.0731,2.1043,5.7955,4.6877,1.5814,1.0328,1.8983,2.7945,4.1718,0.2503,1.4151,1.296,2.5465,3.7685,0.5433,2.1824,0.4781,6.3803,1.157,3.4542,5.4405,1.3381,6.7246,1.7046,0.5032,3.9129,5.7216,0.1035,2.7894,2.9485,6.4523,2.3464,0.8983,8.7611,1.9392,0.002,4.3033,2.1615,0.4688,2.7742,5.0038,2.9988,1.2216,1.7939,0.9796,10.2886,0.0854,1.2207,3.6682,3.0463,5.0563,2.4504,2.8939,0.1369,1.1284,3.9489,3.3513,5.4903,0.281,6.3385,0.074,0.9462,4.3452,1.325,5.5541,5.8546,1.474,0.9205,4.1039,0.0849,0.9977,1.0185,1.2824,1.3034,5.4111,1.1815,2.4633,0.3878,4.9023,4.8953,4.3288,2.9033,2.2124,3.5724,0.7295,7.0309,1.1894,4.8853,0.2764,4.2388,1.7835,0.3369,0.4041,2.8378,0.3656,0.8824,2.9614,1.8557,6.3413,2.2529,5.6599,0.0007,0.5987,5.1345,0.8773,3.5314,0.5313,0.1276,1.3568,2.6582,0.6937,1.5806,4.0034,3.9161,0.8769,3.9473,5.8435,0.1459,2.6878,2.8393,3.5744,0.0406,3.2395,0.2838]}

Strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, the Bulls dominated the league, starting the final year 24 \u2013 3. With a 3 \u2013 3 record, Jordan was nominated for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award, but lost to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers.\nHis teams would finally get a chance to avenge the 1995 \u2013 96 blowout, when the Bucks were defeated in the first of the Eastern Conference Finals in Miami. This was followed by an epic 6 \u2013 4 final win in Cleveland. On December 1, 1995, the Bulls would win the title in Miami, their first in 12 years. In the 1997 \u2013 98 season, after leading the league, the Bulls had to wait until the last game of the season to tie the Milwaukee Bucks, winning the game 103 \u2013 100. Although he was the point guard for the Bulls in the playoffs, Jordan received less than 50% of the votes for Most Valuable Player for the 1995 \u2013 96 season, and was only runner-up for 1996 \u2013 1997. Although this performance was not the year that Jordan won a championship, it was almost certainly the greatest year in the history of the Bulls, and certainly one in the history of basketball.\nThe Lakers received a first-round home series against the Washington Bullets, when a game 4 victory would give them a 3 \u2013 1 advantage in the series. The Bulls were led by the strong performances of Ron Artest and a dominant play by Bill Fitch. In Game 5, Artest had four steals and four assists. With a 4 \u2013 2 lead against the Bullets, the Bulls were ahead of their playoff debut for only the second time in their history.\nThe Bulls would get off to a slow start to the 1996 \u2013 97 season, losing games 1 & 2 before scoring 24 points in a fourth quarter comeback to beat Phoenix. The Bulls continued their season with a convincing win over their arch rivals, the Toronto Raptors, to win 25 games, including nine straight wins. It was the Bulls record for consecutive wins in a season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Bulls made it past the Utah Jazz and Washington Bullets, as they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. It was here that they met again, this time playing against the Philadelphia 76ers. A 104 \u2013 92 win over the Bullets gave Chicago their first conference victory since 1983. Three days later, the Bulls returned to their home court to play the 76ers. A 104 \u2013 96 victory gave the Chicago Bulls their first and only win at the Chicago Spectrum in the 1996 \u2013 97 regular season. It was also the Bulls first loss in the Spectrum in that time. From here, the Bulls would enter the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the East.","token_len":576,"entropy":[6.0353,8.2403,2.3516,1.6163,10.4784,8.3826,1.6238,7.4591,8.6444,6.7007,2.2641,1.0034,9.5844,9.9805,2.6551,2.2276,1.0792,10.5934,0.2742,1.5532,0.0105,0.3603,2.1326,5.2696,0.0024,9.5498,3.3083,5.641,2.9725,0.0022,0.4817,1.5399,2.1024,6.2402,0.6231,3.3772,2.657,6.1912,1.87,3.5891,4.11,11.2845,6.9747,4.5474,1.4829,4.7366,2.2427,4.1904,2.5371,2.4131,0.2208,0.7254,2.7246,2.2254,6.5988,0.2883,0.851,5.1817,0.2879,5.6066,0.0344,0.0257,0.0221,1.1839,2.0432,3.1377,3.9031,2.0085,6.3325,0.0001,0.062,0.022,0.0016,0.0003,0.0002,5.3557,0.0656,2.4016,0.0009,0.1742,1.251,1.099,18.6411,6.1857,4.381,6.344,3.1821,1.9426,0.7623,0.4906,8.5525,0.0081,1.1947,3.3519,1.7624,0.1964,7.1983,0.0523,1.7705,2.8894,1.6381,6.279,3.5761,2.5517,2.3828,1.0939,1.1707,6.6032,2.7737,2.8638,0.0245,1.085,2.9266,5.3792,0.6406,4.6008,1.6998,2.9081,0.1663,2.9022,3.1804,5.482,0.8105,2.222,5.174,5.6983,2.8381,4.1309,2.2712,4.9392,3.3746,3.2869,0.294,1.3039,0.1282,1.6565,0.4911,3.2832,1.9765,0.7062,2.8624,2.6048,3.8228,1.5561,3.8098,0.926,2.963,4.2799,0.2707,0.3185,3.1261,1.2168,5.1518,2.7589,1.0558,0.1571,0.1502,5.9473,5.1192,0.4194,0.675,3.3006,0.6701,0.1859,4.2056,2.7561,5.3367,1.0665,0.6999,4.2212,2.5683,0.5686,0.0973,1.5725,0.4178,6.3871,0.3879,7.8744,1.205,3.017,4.3453,1.6428,3.7237,5.8661,0.5158,3.0501,0.724,5.8586,3.6993,1.8162,3.156,6.7006,0.0106,1.726,0.5236,1.287,2.793,1.2211,2.3167,0.2305,1.1773,6.3155,5.1908,1.7899,3.5773,1.287,0.0557,0.6102,2.0212,2.0167,6.286,0.8706,0.0005,0.0023,4.0426,0.5465,3.0088,0.8142,0.2033,0.1498,2.0316,1.641,1.7395,3.1116,7.4389,0.3233,0.0103,1.2819,9.5168,1.2681,2.4317,1.4343,5.4126,4.8377,6.2189,1.0379,2.4686,2.7442,6.4157,1.6453,2.2271,2.8839,3.1151,1.1632,0.4045,1.3365,0.435,6.4399,1.3852,0.5014,5.423,3.4252,1.7539,1.9644,0.7826,0.0011,0.4398,0.7219,2.9023,1.3931,4.6,2.2502,4.939,2.8896,1.1218,0.0042,1.8471,0.4378,0.4577,2.093,6.1486,6.4022,1.6362,4.4267,1.121,0.1091,8.5957,4.0391,1.0976,0.1232,5.111,1.2784,1.9668,5.1121,4.2681,3.5521,7.48,4.688,3.5665,2.6681,0.9657,1.0836,2.7391,0.4572,1.6982,4.2241,1.567,0.211,1.9985,0.3853,1.6979,2.1148,2.5389,4.7573,0.4349,3.1474,6.5943,4.5539,0.0853,6.5981,1.6999,0.0004,0.9282,5.9488,4.81,4.8097,0.5034,5.3106,6.9404,1.6349,0.991,3.1034,2.3645,0.7871,0.4065,3.1796,0.0009,3.2664,5.0282,3.4075,1.0719,3.6522,0.7877,2.3917,3.5719,2.0547,4.2455,0.1265,1.3862,1.8417,5.1755,0.793,1.7102,0.1751,1.2727,0.5448,2.0607,4.9805,5.2299,3.6469,5.8856,7.5676,5.0949,6.0003,0.3329,0.6815,0.0454,0.2355,2.2046,1.1103,0.3301,2.8963,1.4078,1.6452,1.7148,4.5122,4.2425,0.0315,0.2347,1.8198,0.0037,2.4504,0.1517,2.1836,1.2296,0.593,0.0675,0.6301,3.519,6.6394,3.6744,4.5853,0.2449,4.934,5.1361,5.3763,1.2167,0.8191,2.7925,7.0971,1.2754,3.221,2.2987,1.8905,5.9173,1.5286,1.5237,0.9212,4.8223,1.7667,5.1884,2.2013,0.7373,6.3425,1.7422,0.5639,5.808,2.4002,3.1718,0.7934,0.8522,4.2001,0.038,0.6609,4.1059,2.3594,7.8221,2.3819,1.9551,2.2848,6.2705,2.0825,3.0542,0.7317,4.5769,0.3936,1.2633,2.4092,4.5998,1.4929,1.9602,0.8442,1.6256,0.3805,0.7689,1.1586,2.439,1.0779,3.4275,1.6259,0.5222,0.2105,1.1792,0.2718,0.6135,0.2285,4.7563,1.1445,4.1268,0.4258,5.2027,0.0138,2.497,7.1529,2.444,1.22,5.0388,1.1665,3.8972,0.2372,0.1478,1.9226,0.0313,0.4491,0.677,4.1518,0.3141,7.4429,0.3057,2.0641,3.7307,4.7259,1.2404,0.6514,0.0029,5.9717,3.4563,0.3406,3.0163,0.026,0.0001,1.1378,4.4808,7.9629,0.7543,4.2412,1.6965,2.3364,0.3095,5.0007,3.9975,3.8458,2.0939,0.2963,5.2878,3.0149,0.9564,5.0797,0.827,6.9631,3.054,0.2415,0.1567,0.9304,0.2622,5.7986,0.4199,3.1071,0.8985,1.5762,1.8504,2.2383,0.5174,4.1104,0.0006,2.3927,3.3231,3.8632,0.2103,5.0749,2.1956,3.4416,1.0392,4.0139,0.085,0.7115,0.3162,5.9942,0.2427,2.3368,4.4252,1.9687,5.5641,5.829,2.4393,2.3349,4.5542,0.6621,0.3512,6.0308,0.0063,0.3336,2.7313,0.2899,3.3908,0.5408,1.7154,3.3895,3.3238,1.227,1.6507,12.7141,2.4547,5.0746,2.0478,0.8485,6.5951,3.2113,0.9273,0.8099,0.2651,1.0879,5.0328,0.2626,2.0019,2.1608,0.4697,2.7066,0.0051,0.6431,0.3899,0.5271,0.0693,2.2873,0.9793]}

While Carter was injured ,","text":"After the first five games, all losses, Jeff Carter suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the line @ - @ up for 10 games. While Carter was injured, Jeff was up for grabs and the A\u2019s had been in the hunt all year. Now with Carter still out, the A\u2019s suddenly didn\u2019t want to play the Seahogs, and their opponent decided that he would not be missed. Since the Seahogs still had another game left in the schedule, their plan was for Carter to start. He was supposed to start. But the Seahogs decided that no one, including Seahog owner and CEO, John Hancock, wanted to risk Carter\u2019s return. So, in a move that shocked ( and angered ) many, the Seahogs played their game without Jeff.\nAs a result, Carter continued the streak of having to be pulled from the lineup and replaced by another player. He had the next two games, and then was done. While he did not get any playing time off in the series, that wasn\u2019t much consolation. Jeff Carter was the only player to break up the streak. I would tell you that is not a big deal, but I think anyone who has ever started at center knows a streak isn\u2019t lost on you. In some ways it was frustrating not knowing what to expect after two games, but in others it was refreshing seeing this team put it all down on the line. The defense of the Seahogs was absolutely abysmal in the last two games, and the offensive line was awful. It was like watching the Cubs play ball. What was disappointing, though, was that it wasn\u2019t hard to see why. For many of these players they weren\u2019t going to be paid after the series, so they weren\u2019t too worried about doing anything that would harm the team.\nThe lack of energy on the offensive line in the second half was truly embarrassing. What was even worse was that it wasn\u2019t hard to see that no training or work had occurred. No matter how many times you watched replays of the game that showed guys playing loose and sloppy, no one did anything about it. On defense, I really had to think about how much to criticize the Seahog defensive line. On paper they were stacked with players and big guns, but that alone doesn\u2019t guarantee a great line. We watched what they\u2019re best line did ( what they\u2019ve done in the playoffs before ) and it didn\u2019t fare that well. After the game, we talked to many of the players and I asked what did they do to fix what was so terrible last week.

It excludes the five teams of GP2, which has its own rules and regulations.\nIt is possible that some teams may be added to the roster as an official team or as a result of a sponsorship agreement or marketing strategy. For example, Red Bull Racing is a successful series champion and has a large following.\nIn the case of the other eight teams that do not have the FIA-certified team name for Formula One racing, it may be the case that other entities or individuals may continue to use the name, as in the current case.\nOther team names that are not officially recognised by the FIA by law are used by teams that still do not have the legal right to run by the FIA. The most famous example is HOK Sport.\nThe team's name itself is not officially recognised by the FIA because it is not the registered name of a team or a team with a team name that is not officially used by the FIA team name, which in turn is not the registered name of a FIA team.\nIn the case of the Red Bull Cars team, this name was the result of a sponsorship deal between Red Bull and the company Toyota, with the latter also taking over HOK Sport.\nBecause the official team name has not yet been registered by the FIA, because teams are not using official team names or for others, several teams have started using names such as the Toyota Team Vodafone, Toyota Racing GP, Team Vodafone McLaren or Toyota Racing Team.\nThe team is owned by the Toyota company, which provides engine parts to its parent team Toyota Racing World, which competes in the Japanese Formula Nippon.","token_len":577,"entropy":[2.5476,8.4364,4.4174,2.6713,1.7173,0.2558,10.5537,0.637,3.6566,2.5931,2.6497,0.0964,7.0474,2.9496,1.8895,3.2666,4.0252,0.0993,4.8577,0.8051,7.8014,3.2398,5.9259,2.5931,4.9101,11.0955,0.2617,1.0582,0.5406,1.8472,1.2541,9.2974,1.3091,8.9558,4.5208,4.221,2.2867,0.2454,1.2164,0.9755,0.7646,15.2452,5.6735,0.0767,7.1742,6.7343,6.5332,2.3252,1.4085,4.7411,0.001,3.3162,0.5935,6.2245,1.518,7.2215,3.0024,0.1584,2.087,4.7022,1.8594,0.4206,0.302,0.1635,3.5694,0.8736,2.2581,5.3898,0.0836,2.509,5.1087,4.7813,0.1521,0.5091,0.7792,2.7937,2.338,5.0503,0.6154,4.8264,4.7516,7.903,4.131,6.5777,0.8332,0.7516,1.4008,1.8403,4.8022,4.1652,4.0744,1.2455,0.0018,0.3304,1.3476,5.915,0.0574,0.3171,5.6243,0.6156,7.7367,5.0438,5.2541,1.9847,1.3194,2.9572,3.3741,0.012,0.2934,2.4903,3.4549,2.9854,0.0746,1.8384,0.3712,4.9739,1.1252,2.8753,4.385,1.1761,5.262,1.0191,4.3842,4.974,2.3152,4.0495,2.0153,1.3828,2.9551,0.2659,0.3727,0.4607,3.4752,0.0384,0.2102,2.3976,3.2907,2.8603,0.6023,4.3389,0.4897,0.1009,0.2587,1.4089,4.2705,0.629,2.0261,1.1731,6.3327,0.7888,1.0106,4.2784,0.3276,3.0934,3.3435,2.7775,2.8702,3.3852,5.0053,1.7652,0.5815,1.4907,0.7431,0.26,4.1271,0.0062,1.4042,4.1149,0.45,4.6106,1.6112,2.8627,3.7433,1.314,1.4996,2.8204,2.0461,3.71,1.7579,5.7711,1.5119,1.1263,4.0579,0.9458,2.5499,0.6928,0.6511,5.1193,4.2871,7.323,2.4048,0.3988,0.9469,1.136,5.6863,0.0441,7.1802,1.1971,2.1303,4.1799,0.0156,0.5535,3.7036,3.2279,2.9659,3.5155,1.2405,0.8948,1.5835,3.5336,4.9161,0.8221,3.5671,2.026,3.2625,0.0071,1.3229,0.5739,0.6348,3.6113,3.4949,2.8846,4.6409,1.1817,6.3135,1.9173,2.4126,1.0938,6.2192,0.651,1.8604,3.0005,0.8859,1.5453,3.1417,2.0818,4.6515,6.2619,0.6724,3.7739,0.3837,4.7564,9.2767,1.7949,5.0551,0.9358,3.7596,6.3604,0.9199,1.0114,3.0774,2.5977,4.2669,0.6785,4.521,1.7214,0.3182,0.9837,0.5539,3.4664,0.7385,3.4105,0.2978,3.1314,1.3476,1.4374,1.8344,6.0383,0.3546,0.5935,6.382,3.0933,3.9319,4.6353,1.807,3.748,2.2414,1.3819,5.1409,0.0439,2.1213,5.532,1.8398,3.5502,7.206,4.7114,1.0825,3.8753,0.4598,0.0907,5.0492,0.0034,1.7918,2.5382,2.5575,6.8695,6.7515,7.0009,1.9469,1.725,2.4302,4.3913,2.773,2.641,0.8095,2.7953,1.8773,2.8037,0.0273,2.1631,5.0488,4.9097,0.2582,2.5953,4.2772,0.2451,1.1893,3.3075,2.0675,3.6165,5.3561,0.0192,2.5991,0.7621,4.7881,3.4931,0.0475,4.3797,0.2075,2.3255,3.2197,0.3775,3.3161,0.4804,0.0705,4.156,6.7107,3.656,1.9504,0.9407,5.2948,0.2813,0.6891,0.6744,0.9318,2.8705,2.4463,3.2889,1.0241,6.6698,0.5337,1.6988,0.6358,5.3455,5.0148,0.339,2.1796,1.531,1.6275,2.9107,2.0801,0.4836,0.0524,0.094,6.6378,3.9869,1.2795,5.2945,1.1515,2.2665,2.149,5.4725,3.5522,0.1713,0.4889,0.8532,4.885,4.093,0.1004,5.619,7.1837,1.0263,0.9733,0.823,3.5081,4.0571,2.5881,0.4892,0.7959,7.1823,7.6969,5.0158,2.8398,0.9444,1.995,4.3281,3.1405,2.2035,6.6737,0.882,1.8107,1.4509,0.1803,0.239,0.1006,0.1347,4.2966,1.1286,0.8993,1.2159,3.8162,5.48,0.6421,0.1621,1.8147,1.1386,2.4276,1.8626,2.1713,4.5369,1.1604,3.251,1.0459,1.902,0.8946,1.3397,1.6353,5.9141,0.354,0.1838,0.209,8.5912,3.1719,3.579,2.7702,4.1081,1.0002,0.4424,0.2876,1.5731,0.8848,0.1505,0.0365,0.6024,7.2196,1.1725,0.4861,0.5248,2.5765,1.5914,0.8967,0.0664,1.3739,5.245,0.0352,9.7031,2.9362,0.5305,4.2507,2.3761,1.5381,5.0582,5.1379,0.0177,0.8104,1.1794,0.953,1.4832,1.6061,0.0013,1.929,1.9264,4.9357,9.3481,2.0774,3.626,0.9624,3.0811,5.0348,4.2172,1.8175,5.9983,0.0157,1.007,1.2816,0.5829,6.7292,1.6466,6.3561,1.7437,0.2057,3.4168,0.9935,1.528,0.0899,2.4839,1.1228,0.0787,0.0545,0.4138,7.006,6.5991,1.8317,1.0892,5.0527,4.2579,1.8533,0.139,3.7856,4.6628,7.4873,2.0434,7.4357,0.7627,1.302,4.7071,0.926,5.0262,3.0205,0.0034,2.8532,5.0387,3.266,7.1745,5.5909,0.0432,0.003,1.8343,3.4263,1.6223,7.5279,1.2702,4.2967,3.4452,0.1072,0.0196,0.005,7.1922,2.9278,2.1434,0.5469,2.9166,3.9027,0.4025,1.9051,3.4254,3.2615,5.0067,0.1843,1.7698,4.7516,5.7812,1.3067,1.1506,5.6642,6.2924,2.1761,1.978,3.6852,5.7572,4.3234,4.6092,3.1722,7.8462,2.2317,1.1443,6.2676,0.0015,1.877,1.0889,3.2841,1.7633,8.4327,3.5071,0.0002,5.6993]}
{"prompt":"If investigations confirm NSCLC , the stage is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it can not be cured surgically","text":"If investigations confirm NSCLC, the stage is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it can not be cured surgically.\nAs discussed before, stage IV is the most advanced stage of cancer. The general guidelines to follow have been described. However, the individual patient must be assessed. A patient with stage IV cancer cannot expect a cure or improvement through surgery as the tumor already has spread beyond its borders.\nA number of options are available to provide medical therapies for the treatment of stage IV disease, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapies, vaccines, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy.\nChemotherapy is used to treat cancer by affecting the growth of cancer cells. It can also suppress or kill cancer cells that have already emerged.\nChemotherapy can also suppress the immune system, which causes cancer cells to grow or multiply too fast and causes them to spread (metastasize) beyond their original site of origin. chemotherapy agents are often toxic to the whole body, so the patient can not receive chemotherapy for a long period of time.\nThe goal of cancer treatment is to kill or destroy cancer cells and prevent their growth or reproduction, but chemotherapy agents tend to destroy both healthy and cancer cells.\nChemotherapy is generally a form of cancer treatment intended to kill or slow down cancer growth through the use of chemicals to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\nThe goal of hormonal therapy is to reduce or stop the growth of cancer cells. Hormonal therapy may also help to control hormone-based symptoms of cancer, such as those associated with estrogenic hormones. Hormonal therapy has shown some success in treating advanced lung cancer, including breast cancer, but its use is limited due to side-effects, such as reduced libido and reduced bone mass.\nThe primary therapy for advanced NSCLC is chemotherapy, which has been shown to improve outcomes overall. However, this approach appears to be no more effective in younger subjects, whose survival is not increased by chemotherapy.\nThe patient can be given chemo-based treatment and also targeted therapy to treat advanced NSCLC. There are four classes of targeted therapies that could be used to treat early to advanced NSCLC, including EGFR, ALK, Her2, and ROS. Patients with NSCLC who suffer from the mutation EGFR may be treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib\/cisplatin (Iressa) and erlotinib.\nThere are five classes of drugs currently under review for use in patients with advanced NSCLC, including the platinum agents cisplatin\/carboplatin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and pemetrexed, and the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel.","token_len":580,"entropy":[11.4949,6.6035,12.0811,5.1245,1.2293,3.4457,2.5383,9.3581,1.4908,11.7313,2.7211,1.533,0.9529,1.4318,5.5266,1.1586,6.8854,2.3907,7.6336,0.7882,0.0487,6.1165,2.4452,3.8404,1.6853,2.6925,2.9719,0.798,2.6732,8.4189,0.5557,1.3147,2.1161,3.7739,0.2969,3.0146,7.5973,0.0,0.3106,1.0991,15.3309,4.6729,4.2813,0.1034,7.6836,2.3781,2.1801,1.86,1.0249,4.4341,0.3982,0.5759,2.7309,1.3988,2.1416,6.8209,4.7703,5.0257,1.3689,6.0011,0.6067,3.8171,3.1238,2.7491,0.01,2.2095,5.7953,2.7597,2.7066,0.8772,3.6396,5.2093,3.6503,3.2358,1.2662,1.3693,0.2873,1.6678,4.5102,4.0289,3.0212,2.6472,3.1702,6.2969,5.2605,0.9318,5.1049,2.4506,3.5079,6.7881,1.0869,3.5155,4.0333,3.0493,7.4379,0.643,1.5592,3.4056,5.02,0.0024,4.8608,1.4337,0.1586,1.0571,5.1527,5.7916,7.8804,1.3053,2.1073,2.5319,0.0528,0.8784,0.1164,4.5575,2.4068,0.7755,2.1094,0.4809,7.2963,0.3703,0.296,6.2671,1.702,0.719,7.7071,0.3203,2.9155,0.5622,0.3218,1.2775,2.6471,0.5589,0.1081,1.4876,4.6445,0.0285,1.8182,3.4325,0.7275,0.4546,2.0411,3.004,7.2869,0.7398,2.9584,0.5585,2.2767,0.3065,1.2782,1.8881,2.5337,1.6122,6.311,1.8586,2.7742,1.5372,0.1584,2.8638,2.0456,1.7119,6.4242,1.1589,2.3755,4.3478,0.0218,2.1086,1.1935,3.756,2.4327,3.502,0.2163,1.7611,1.6588,4.072,2.0226,1.4645,0.0517,2.4689,4.8143,4.2788,7.1834,2.7401,2.6426,5.415,2.2454,0.0147,3.976,5.3927,7.427,0.4785,4.6855,2.4963,1.252,4.5697,0.8478,2.995,4.7738,0.8288,0.562,0.3253,12.0269,5.788,1.9831,2.8614,5.5553,1.2226,1.0881,6.9592,0.1441,1.315,3.2942,2.4432,2.1925,3.4045,3.0188,2.1787,2.434,2.5335,2.4782,2.2889,0.5434,0.2552,0.0004,0.4422,0.7503,2.7104,4.5899,0.2475,3.7461,1.1555,0.2156,0.2332,3.3151,2.4186,2.281,1.2956,0.1645,2.6238,3.0797,1.9238,0.7879,1.7466,4.135,2.5592,2.0006,1.9678,2.657,6.5473,0.0422,3.877,5.5901,5.2722,0.9591,1.3451,1.992,0.6814,1.2434,2.1003,0.0452,1.3249,3.8176,4.205,4.2683,0.0025,2.7799,0.8144,5.9721,0.1732,2.4542,0.5725,5.6086,1.8065,1.531,0.9067,5.8744,2.0355,1.563,0.0068,3.6669,3.1419,6.0061,0.0144,1.0014,1.1842,0.8243,1.0299,0.1346,0.3511,1.4637,2.2981,3.4753,0.1392,8.483,0.1548,0.2248,0.223,2.8484,2.0086,1.3756,0.7085,1.0015,0.1406,1.0936,0.1834,1.2007,5.4463,0.5336,0.1303,3.6259,1.2069,3.3808,1.1098,2.8413,5.913,2.7326,5.4411,4.9011,1.9483,0.9408,1.5042,0.5076,0.0017,6.0785,1.281,0.0012,4.1842,4.2522,2.2108,0.9178,3.3843,0.1427,0.1501,3.3985,4.179,4.1445,0.8712,0.3587,1.5618,5.0627,6.1752,0.236,1.1307,3.403,2.7658,0.766,0.8087,2.0284,3.9671,2.0906,1.5444,1.2389,2.816,0.005,4.4298,3.497,0.0094,2.3488,1.549,0.0006,4.8999,3.9391,0.001,1.0227,3.501,5.8405,1.9404,0.2762,0.437,2.3975,3.5293,4.7524,0.8247,2.5806,11.7158,0.0091,0.001,0.3174,2.6534,1.892,0.8089,2.8466,0.7856,0.6535,0.0344,4.4037,3.9672,7.8476,1.0419,1.7661,0.0048,3.9467,3.3113,5.5588,0.1433,0.6605,5.919,1.1204,0.0914,2.315,6.8674,5.823,2.0131,4.4014,6.1902,1.1423,3.1863,4.4883,1.0419,0.9117,0.6024,0.6489,2.1351,5.4898,3.2128,1.6595,2.7956,4.4496,0.4051,2.7518,4.2042,2.7362,3.7955,5.3989,6.4845,1.8064,1.9308,1.7423,2.3792,0.4785,0.0012,0.0013,0.6154,4.1571,0.5052,4.278,4.7198,0.0388,3.0324,1.1684,2.6727,4.7952,0.1492,0.6307,1.1686,0.7118,5.0022,7.447,1.9024,0.4126,0.0019,0.001,2.6662,1.5572,11.0076,0.1416,1.0297,6.4616,5.0917,1.1936,11.1017,5.7917,0.8132,0.5486,7.8976,0.8165,5.0421,0.8667,5.8105,0.0028,0.001,2.21,4.7076,0.1638,4.078,6.2942,9.1025,0.0033,2.1278,1.367,2.4769,0.4101,4.5449,0.0037,12.7136,0.0318,0.0426,1.3046,0.0338,0.3047,0.858,2.8252,0.8287,1.3524,0.8551,3.5669,0.0022,6.0743,4.4163,6.1447,0.5025,2.2994,6.4473,4.3804,3.2796,2.0087,0.0115,2.0989,6.3747,13.5061,2.9244,2.41,2.1563,7.4428,5.0666,0.1098,0.1594,2.391,1.2986,3.5913,0.3528,4.392,2.6699,0.0189,4.3356,4.0614,4.1124,2.8519,1.0931,3.8312,0.5657,2.9229,0.1501,0.3217,0.0368,0.0017,0.0015,1.6307,0.7919,3.5032,8.5537,8.1719,6.8549,0.126,0.0032,3.5588,7.3036,2.0956,0.0024,0.5241,7.023,1.5248,0.0662,0.0078,0.7985,6.1257,3.3544,7.4383,7.4112,2.5047,3.8999,4.3568,4.3245,1.1354,4.8493,3.1612,1.6447,1.837,10.0006,6.8602,9.599,0.4062,0.007,0.0884,1.6233,7.2083,1.6917,1.4505,0.002,0.337]}
{"prompt":"Volume II opens in Summer 1809 with Strange learning of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him . They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass ( the legendary Raven King )","text":"Volume II opens in Summer 1809 with Strange learning of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him. They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass ( the legendary Raven King ) to them both. Strange will not listen to a word of Norrell\u2019s argument on the matter and will insist that the King be allowed to be worshipped openly ( which the King does get ) without restriction. When Strange arrives in Dunstable to find that Mr Norrell has already been executed for his disloyalty, the King becomes jealous and immediately starts to seek his vengeance on Strange, by making him believe that he\u2019s betrayed him and that his own son was at work in his death when an attack was mounted by the Raven King. This eventually leads Strange to suspect that the Raven King may have actually done such an attack, but as the two were estranged that is of course preposterous. As Strange continues to investigate this and to discover further on the strange circumstances leading up to Mr Norrell\u2019s murder he quickly finds himself being investigated and at risk of imprisonment ( as his brother Thomas seems to have a vested interest in making sure he doesn\u2019t follow the right path ). We then cut to late April 1810 and find Strange and Mr Norrell still at large ( both of them being desperate to get rid of the other ), with each of them having been captured by the authorities. In London Strange runs into Mr Norrell in front of the Temple Court on February 9, 1811 where it was rumored that the King had finally died ( both men quickly discredited this rumour at the time ).\nStrange then sets out once more to find the King, finding himself being followed and pursued by a young man named Captain Jolyon. When it turns out that the man in question is actually the King his name turns into \u201c John Uskglass \u201d and he becomes Jonny.\nWhile in his time in Dunstable, Strange falls in love with Molly Bloom, the daughter of Dr. Stephen Bloom, and takes her home to live with his sister Jane in the summer of 1810. He has had many times with Molly \u2013 as the two are clearly attracted to one another ( although she seems to be aware of it as she\u2019s not eager to even suggest having sex with Norrell, who she clearly dislikes ). Molly has just discovered that her father ( Dr. Stephen Bloom ) is actually Norrell\u2019s friend and is therefore secretly mourning his death, while also being quite pleased when Strange suggests that Norrell is actually alive and well and that he had secretly been aiding Strange in his search for Norrell. When Strange and Molly move to London, Molly is taken straight to John Uskglass\u2019 place to be taken care of by his family, while Strange is taken to Mr. Norrell\u2019s place to get his belongings.","token_len":581,"entropy":[8.6282,9.6314,2.4432,8.362,6.9787,4.9019,3.3094,10.1535,13.9774,1.4914,6.9157,10.0427,2.6996,3.0838,8.3286,0.6163,2.4897,1.1604,2.2435,1.6806,0.5236,4.1085,6.9414,6.3377,1.8633,1.4425,5.9373,0.0244,7.3982,10.5646,6.3561,9.7362,3.9573,9.7226,5.7407,8.9144,4.9792,1.5482,4.074,4.0913,4.6189,0.9799,2.9927,6.031,3.8093,3.741,0.3272,5.1333,2.291,0.8112,4.0568,0.0422,12.6251,8.1026,4.5125,5.8896,5.1287,1.3258,0.8383,1.6689,2.3498,5.5434,0.631,2.1618,3.4449,2.8362,3.7265,0.1859,3.5088,6.3921,7.4274,4.3004,5.8079,4.1714,1.3051,2.7621,7.7577,6.3541,4.1687,5.1992,0.4806,3.965,1.1496,3.936,1.6385,8.7418,2.3252,2.2811,2.587,2.2568,3.9105,0.8196,0.0087,0.9578,3.8338,1.4863,3.3461,2.6171,2.1599,7.2615,0.0006,0.0643,1.2143,2.5921,0.6695,5.6235,5.6428,0.6927,5.8586,3.9752,2.2092,6.2457,3.5257,2.6116,1.5961,0.6047,3.3841,5.8567,4.0117,1.1142,5.3805,0.2982,1.4196,10.8717,0.6431,0.0427,6.6521,2.2972,1.7531,1.73,2.8304,3.8011,2.9079,2.0936,5.315,4.9366,2.4129,1.9575,2.569,6.2389,5.8414,3.7672,2.1348,4.7291,2.5257,1.6159,3.9716,0.6313,0.8969,3.6897,5.968,0.835,1.7358,0.3428,4.1598,0.3237,1.5151,2.1065,0.1673,2.9977,0.5895,4.7933,4.0784,5.0037,1.7071,1.6626,2.189,2.0546,4.1313,2.3145,3.9668,5.6894,7.6815,6.6919,2.8373,6.2926,2.6756,9.0191,0.0031,0.0059,0.4708,3.7252,1.2694,3.846,0.4511,2.9549,2.6006,3.7696,3.9222,1.7386,5.484,5.9829,1.6466,6.1925,5.497,4.0885,1.0034,0.0167,3.1462,0.1207,0.0017,0.8392,0.005,0.0121,2.1644,4.2647,4.8287,2.9074,1.7651,3.9908,4.7957,3.0664,6.0236,6.0417,0.232,4.2113,4.4142,3.7281,4.5886,3.7118,5.121,5.7414,0.2281,0.9473,3.5763,4.7881,0.0415,0.0623,4.2968,1.5071,1.9258,2.6079,0.5591,0.0181,2.1976,6.2547,1.6814,6.0174,0.9085,1.5206,6.5721,2.9887,8.8797,0.1661,7.2112,5.2332,1.7439,1.4673,2.2855,5.0501,0.6617,2.2928,3.6703,0.5777,0.002,4.9749,3.4468,3.3956,2.6704,5.7311,2.4592,0.9109,3.3043,8.28,0.7142,1.957,4.6691,0.0084,1.7003,4.6783,6.7576,2.9808,5.9389,1.8276,0.1282,2.6761,2.5293,4.4708,0.8848,0.7486,7.0791,1.2421,3.7041,6.1554,1.6791,6.5098,0.5427,2.6914,0.5737,0.0013,2.9381,5.9133,0.0024,1.001,6.3276,7.705,4.3695,5.1354,3.5381,1.6853,0.3172,2.5103,4.4125,5.1072,3.7851,4.962,0.2325,1.9957,1.9646,1.1992,4.9582,3.4,2.5403,7.1966,3.153,6.7839,9.7214,1.8044,3.7553,0.0062,5.0291,0.616,0.2315,2.3457,2.5236,4.6656,3.0723,4.5411,0.4845,6.8067,0.7392,0.4282,1.5743,1.7423,1.8935,2.0763,5.1873,4.0275,3.2827,4.1515,3.2068,4.6406,0.2254,1.9517,5.0898,1.9795,1.0909,6.2945,5.2043,5.1044,1.7451,2.3922,3.9668,5.2352,3.0076,0.0014,0.2521,1.9949,2.6176,4.3297,0.2044,0.8716,3.1201,2.2629,1.8832,6.787,5.7757,3.8097,3.6682,9.0886,4.8001,6.59,1.064,0.0131,0.0634,4.1639,7.1425,1.258,2.3796,4.4431,10.3183,1.9403,2.7867,2.4068,5.1418,2.8555,4.9375,5.2547,1.5265,2.2842,0.0135,1.5231,0.6668,6.3207,0.9113,0.1113,0.0384,8.293,6.7334,1.7279,2.5647,1.5651,0.0325,4.8092,1.009,4.6049,1.7383,1.3571,1.4169,5.3177,0.9387,3.8892,1.4938,3.4923,0.1998,2.8775,2.9577,5.5094,4.2916,2.057,5.8975,0.8708,0.1224,2.5391,0.2848,2.7982,3.7862,4.5398,3.4475,5.0791,2.06,1.908,7.5562,4.3728,3.6527,1.6433,2.9375,5.615,4.2127,0.4707,2.244,0.01,3.1661,4.6917,2.9059,3.3867,0.4141,1.4526,6.0504,0.4709,3.6942,2.5126,1.86,5.6546,0.0772,0.0098,2.7827,7.6692,0.2411,6.7416,7.8627,4.7763,1.1284,0.3513,6.007,0.0094,3.055,3.4005,2.3305,4.8288,3.9743,0.0007,2.4486,3.996,3.0127,6.2216,4.9607,0.5418,3.1559,1.1458,3.5956,4.6405,0.0352,1.0952,0.1576,0.7936,1.2659,3.1126,6.341,0.0068,2.6431,0.0679,0.0395,5.487,1.1237,2.8882,5.7043,4.56,6.4465,1.3466,0.5488,2.3433,3.3402,3.2836,2.4532,4.5077,4.0874,4.0275,2.5457,6.3977,0.5721,5.9843,0.0084,2.4516,3.0153,4.355,1.5046,1.3855,1.911,1.4575,1.0,4.5073,6.597,1.6856,8.6402,3.6826,1.2333,0.766,2.9434,0.3028,2.522,0.0319,0.8765,3.38,1.7383,2.7325,0.1654,5.9524,1.1498,2.0071,1.6372,1.1083,1.8661,4.0068,7.3318,0.4725,4.1381,0.1815,0.003,0.0305,1.7514,0.8995,13.7782,3.1084,2.1978,3.4746,3.6099,0.0067,0.6356,1.804,3.9745,1.8561,2.7902,1.6499,1.6779,2.0666,0.8642,4.3149,1.3195,0.7358,0.0035,2.0193,0.0207,0.7851,1.8557,0.8959,5.1583,2.2863,6.0086,1.9283]}

At this time he wrote the poem \" Vain Shame \", in tribute to the war effort. With the Second World War, Du Bois had to face the racism and political persecution he had faced before.

Possession of amounts larger than < unk > dried or 5g fresh lead to a criminal charge. These two mushrooms are frequently used in Asian food preparation and for making traditional Chinese medicines. A study undertaken recently at the Institute for Natural Sciences, Ministry of Science and Technology showed that these two types of mushrooms harbored large amounts of metals and it remains unknown whether the presence of heavy metals is harmful or not.\nAccording to the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life of Italy, the health risks of mushroom poisoning are mainly associated to the absence of adequate information among consumers. Mushroom poisoning usually happens in restaurants that use food prepared from wild mushrooms because the restaurant workers might be less aware of the legal regulations. This is the reason why it is important to take measures for proper disposal of mushroom residues in restaurants in order to avoid public health risks.\nAn important risk is related to disposal of fresh mushrooms in restaurants or public areas. Mushrooms can be eaten fresh or canned, and the mushroom industry provides the market with a huge number of varieties. This is a risk for both food safety and public health in countries where there is no monitoring of residues and the disposal of raw or unprocessed mushrooms in non-compliant places.\nThe use of these two mushrooms in food and healthcare products pose a risk for the consumers and people who consume them. The use of these mushrooms as raw materials in health and nutritional products is illegal in the European Union and other countries. These mushrooms are also frequently used in Asian food preparation, and the use of Chinese herbal medicines is widespread.\nIn general, mushrooms seem to be safe to people who are not sensitive to them. However, the consumption of mushrooms by sensitive users, such as children, the elderly, patients with compromised immunological functions and hospitalized patients can present health risks. There have been case reports of fatalities due to accidental ingestion of toxic substances found in mushrooms.\nThe health risks are mainly associated to the presence of secondary metabolites in mushrooms, as well as toxins or mycotoxins. Mycotoxins and toxins are not present in all types of mushrooms. Moreover, there has been no investigation on the safety of different types of mushrooms sold in stores worldwide. The presence of heavy metals is also not related to health risks, but since this research work has shown that the presence of contaminants is widespread, the risk for consumers should be properly analyzed.\nThe presence of antibiotics, heavy metals and phylotoxic compounds in mushrooms can pose a danger to the consumers, but it has not been demonstrated if these substances are harmful for humans. The consumption of medicinal mushrooms is not recommended unless the use has been recommended by a physician or by a doctor specializing in this type of mushroom. The consumption of mushrooms on an off -therapy schedule should be avoided.","token_len":582,"entropy":[8.281,3.1867,11.6987,2.9229,0.2724,3.833,7.5931,0.0469,7.3821,0.9164,2.9802,2.1578,8.8291,2.7216,2.9407,2.1328,1.2214,0.8153,0.9978,1.6883,7.7187,7.952,3.6532,0.4494,6.1955,0.0941,0.7432,8.9005,4.5895,0.0039,11.0867,11.6625,7.2138,5.6561,11.1149,2.534,8.1742,4.6039,6.8524,9.7518,4.9236,1.2615,2.9117,1.6701,1.2045,5.1037,3.5161,6.1044,0.8095,6.5343,1.364,1.4055,6.2359,3.3806,3.7505,1.8578,4.7393,4.5866,4.8425,1.5712,5.1016,0.5351,4.2829,6.6885,6.3372,6.5456,3.309,0.8715,4.2162,1.8489,5.4565,5.2433,2.9886,9.435,0.0216,3.2442,0.4791,0.2655,4.8862,0.1812,4.0193,1.7301,4.2241,0.0567,0.9459,10.3064,0.1018,4.9827,0.6231,0.0008,6.9097,1.4719,8.8094,6.2679,2.5671,1.0273,2.1863,4.2886,0.0618,6.5622,0.0774,2.4414,4.8468,2.5935,1.3314,0.1217,1.3597,12.5001,0.0037,0.8795,2.2743,0.1108,1.5628,1.7025,8.3766,2.4322,3.2462,2.2585,7.9889,0.3231,1.858,4.9876,3.1244,0.9048,5.6115,3.6397,0.7005,4.848,3.6757,5.6523,2.0405,7.36,0.065,3.1975,6.3543,6.113,2.2418,1.3172,6.9524,1.2289,5.2633,4.3153,1.744,6.2715,5.009,3.173,4.4114,1.749,2.0012,4.4592,0.6307,5.9436,1.8876,6.9325,4.1417,5.8582,2.2975,6.2356,2.9118,0.214,0.4327,7.4445,5.908,1.7366,3.784,1.5781,3.3282,1.4972,0.538,2.8977,0.1528,2.293,0.3014,4.0429,4.9442,4.5516,4.0233,4.683,0.3152,4.7745,4.8958,1.9779,1.647,4.4366,1.1216,0.0249,1.5573,5.5616,0.5142,1.6131,0.4018,0.8926,5.1559,3.7978,4.8657,2.1332,5.9481,0.028,8.459,0.1867,6.2572,2.6159,2.0075,2.3702,4.3604,4.8244,2.093,0.7189,4.1389,0.0008,2.0748,0.7181,3.9904,3.1136,2.2443,4.0663,1.7762,2.0944,2.5088,5.2787,4.9707,4.5674,2.945,4.6821,1.1038,1.7609,4.2184,3.266,0.0045,5.1071,2.3047,3.6543,1.3172,2.9773,3.6909,3.4759,3.1638,3.3038,3.0182,0.1065,2.7849,0.0418,2.947,5.0465,1.2913,2.7701,0.6888,2.1519,8.7151,0.6908,6.6498,2.4834,2.5879,6.2676,0.1527,3.5809,1.3739,3.9046,1.1048,0.0013,0.6038,2.7912,7.149,0.091,7.0489,0.018,2.6613,0.4389,0.913,2.2673,4.1165,0.042,4.3192,2.7439,2.095,1.5756,2.6592,3.452,7.1095,2.5215,6.649,1.0328,2.4741,2.3137,1.7383,5.1065,1.8229,6.0226,1.9806,1.1872,0.2558,0.4045,2.0633,2.5783,0.0388,1.0305,1.369,3.4173,3.7625,2.2777,1.6922,4.1959,2.2424,4.1777,0.5439,1.1174,2.1301,1.4257,2.26,2.0801,0.0057,1.3711,3.5642,0.672,0.8415,4.1174,3.7618,0.6563,2.2965,5.8733,0.3961,0.6386,4.2091,0.9775,0.2966,2.1486,2.0545,2.8622,1.9578,0.0749,7.8909,2.6203,0.9678,1.6736,4.3538,0.6665,1.0878,3.0099,3.9158,0.1463,3.8527,6.6853,0.1237,0.4592,2.4822,1.5809,9.3767,1.6627,1.9164,1.7218,3.6847,0.115,1.896,0.5895,1.668,0.0251,2.0703,3.4001,0.111,2.1731,3.0203,5.2661,5.3292,3.6307,1.6776,0.0018,1.35,0.6053,5.8818,0.0225,0.2367,5.3149,0.919,4.7101,5.9907,1.9223,3.04,2.7083,7.2987,0.285,3.5227,5.0471,3.0001,0.3996,0.747,4.3348,3.0378,0.1489,5.6025,0.1202,0.2524,6.5028,1.7761,0.0027,4.2324,0.35,0.2652,6.0416,3.0744,5.2247,0.1436,1.4831,0.7398,1.2444,2.155,3.4389,0.8427,4.0497,2.8758,1.5134,0.6031,0.6013,1.4188,0.1252,9.37,2.1912,1.7634,1.6414,1.7921,3.602,0.6183,0.0047,6.6631,4.26,8.7482,0.4147,0.0105,0.0021,1.4274,5.808,0.0725,0.0587,0.0122,3.5476,3.2989,1.0519,4.1624,3.7119,0.0884,3.5464,3.2236,0.0166,0.6626,1.581,5.6123,0.0127,2.8145,3.1371,0.0609,1.764,5.0499,2.9921,0.3788,2.3835,0.246,5.8896,0.6787,0.0384,0.3529,7.3317,0.6023,4.7077,5.9428,0.5584,2.3749,3.4607,0.093,5.07,0.052,3.0777,2.09,1.7151,5.8639,0.0238,4.1059,1.0015,2.2164,2.0432,6.5984,4.1129,6.0186,6.6707,2.0795,3.4313,0.4478,1.7911,0.8517,0.0229,5.1217,1.8423,6.4238,0.8302,1.861,2.1857,2.6904,5.0636,3.3712,0.1778,7.6799,5.7591,0.5428,0.5467,1.8835,3.8865,0.0667,7.3532,2.0341,6.5399,0.0199,1.1021,13.7041,3.0423,0.8429,2.6914,0.6005,0.9382,2.527,3.1826,1.4503,3.1782,0.41,1.4574,4.8601,2.2514,3.5865,2.828,3.188,0.6335,0.0727,3.5678,4.0675,1.3826,1.3224,0.8917,1.3819,3.6833,2.5732,0.6313,2.0302,4.5118,0.0547,5.4475,0.5193,1.5891,1.8986,2.736,4.2999,1.5128,2.7156,4.214,0.2016,3.7014,0.6338,1.3529,2.342,1.4155,3.4197,0.8556,3.2123,5.1883,0.0197,4.1429,3.5461,0.0273,4.5665,0.3939,2.3076,2.8963,0.0445,2.1298,4.9894,3.8672,5.1355,10.4677,7.8182,2.3105,6.733,3.0921,0.5767,1.0065,1.2317]}

The third session was","text":"Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race \u2014 two on Friday, and a third on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was a half-day event, lasting between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. that saw the car running over several laps with the tires and brakes cold, which is necessary due to the increased rolling resistance of the newly developed braking system.\nThe session was broken up by an hour long stoppage. This was where the tires and brakes could be warmed up, and the driver could get out his checklist of items to be completed before the race began. The first stoppage was for pit crew and personnel to change the new brakes. Next, the driver would check the power supply, brakes, and check the fuel and oil levels. This was followed by the driver getting a warm-up run in through the car, inspecting his car\u2019s condition, examining his tires, checking the brakes and other parts, and testing the gearbox. This was followed by a short run to confirm everything is working properly, and an inspection of the electronics to ensure everything is set up for optimal performance.\nAll the time, the drivers must remain in the racing positions, which means that the drivers had to use their feet and head to control the car, but could also use their body to control it. The entire system of the car was connected to a computer system with a full array of sensors and computers, allowing for the car\u2019s control and other functions to be programmed.\nOn the Saturday morning, driver Michael Schumacher conducted one practice lap. But then, he ran a crash, damaging the front wing. The car required major repairs and some time off to get the damaged parts replaced. The car then needed to be tuned.\nOn Sunday, the race was conducted on a three-wide track. The race began at 11:52 a.m. EST. The cars that started out were the cars on the starting line. Michael Schumacher led during most of the race, but by the 70th lap he had dropped to second place and was quickly overtaken by Kimi Raikkonen of Finland.\nIn the early stages of the race, Schumacher was a lap down behind Petrov. But by the end of the race, Petrov was already back at Schumacher.

Fox asked","text":"There have been numerous attempts to make a film version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked David Goyer to write the screenplay, but Goyer never signed on. Following Goyer's death in 1997, the project was picked up by Dino De Laurentiis, who hired Brian Helgeland to write the screenplay for the film. In 1998 De Laurentiis lost interest in the project and Helgeland resigned from the project.\nA year later, the film project fell into a void until 2002 when Universal Pictures and New Line Cinema acquired the rights to adapt the series for film production before completing development in 2004.\nIn March 2005, Bryan Singer signed on to helm the film adaptation. Singer was also brought on to write the film's screenplay based on a concept art that was commissioned by producer Simon Kinberg, who developed the film project after seeing concepts being developed by studio executives. Singer departed the film project due to personal and scheduling conflicts in mid-2006. When Kinberg decided not to follow up with the project, the film project was turned over to writer and director Alan Burnett following Brad Singer, Peter Moffat, Lawrence Kasdan, and William J. Macy. Burnett was brought on board in January 2008 as writer\/assistant director after being selected to direct several unwritten elements based on the art. By 2009 Burnett had written and directed a full script with the main film plot, however he did not find a production company to produce the film.\nIn 2014, Warner Bros began developing the sequel with a script written by Christopher Nolan.\n\nProduction\n\nProduction on the film began on November 3, 2007, in New Orleans and was closed indefinitely on February 24, 2008 due to budgetary difficulties. Despite closing down filming, the music for the film, titled \"Live In The Dark\" was made available to music outlets by Warner Records and was recorded for the soundtrack album on March 7, 2008. After the film was canceled, actor Wesley Snipes began a search for producers to have the rights to the film. In April 2007 Warner Bros and Universal Pictures announced they no longer wished to pursue the film, and Snipes signed a letter of intent with Paramount Pictures to produce his third and fourth The Matrix films. After Snipes' contract with Paramount was up earlier this year, Snipes is said to be negotiating to make the third entry with either Columbia Pictures or Sony Pictures. However, they have not confirmed if Snipes has signed to make the third Matrix film, only stating that he is no longer a producer of The Matrix, citing \"other interests in his life\".\nDue to the recent announcement of Snipes, the producers of New Line Cinema considered making the film again and were reportedly looking into replacing Singer with Jon M. Chu, who adapted the novel, but this has not yet happened.","token_len":583,"entropy":[4.4819,0.1446,3.6429,3.0551,0.5606,4.1281,2.6759,5.3226,5.654,0.1372,8.0494,0.1977,5.0301,5.7792,0.8497,4.0898,6.8076,7.5774,8.4515,0.158,5.4484,0.9381,7.8514,7.0167,0.0113,0.9345,0.7276,2.7315,2.9741,6.5027,0.9315,0.0228,0.0051,0.5794,6.6832,7.4237,5.3626,3.8769,0.0284,1.0298,2.0716,1.058,1.8332,1.0195,1.1419,2.2724,0.0007,4.433,3.7434,0.8834,0.8483,6.4383,3.0322,0.0039,0.0575,1.9677,0.7994,3.5703,0.0756,1.635,2.6566,0.7283,4.6151,0.0221,0.3018,10.8619,0.9389,0.0015,0.0006,0.0,1.0672,0.7814,5.2223,6.8945,7.2034,0.0318,0.0945,0.9757,0.7753,0.5872,1.1986,2.7753,0.9635,1.8287,0.478,3.601,2.8642,4.5559,0.0014,0.0014,0.0003,6.7618,2.604,0.5943,0.8975,0.1032,1.2251,7.2887,0.0017,0.0002,4.9546,1.6055,0.578,0.3631,0.7131,1.2018,10.7045,3.7183,0.3067,0.2846,2.3652,2.5566,4.3167,5.4106,3.0205,4.1513,6.3235,6.3179,4.9901,1.0021,4.3798,2.3495,3.8804,6.0261,0.0782,3.3471,1.8602,0.6287,0.0801,0.4429,6.4679,0.9662,2.4379,0.9823,3.0404,5.7715,8.1322,5.5896,3.6103,4.5919,2.8536,0.1999,1.9655,2.8271,4.2299,1.7537,0.2509,7.7473,0.2383,4.0629,0.4464,0.6265,4.4362,0.6147,1.3818,2.3536,1.7181,2.0071,2.3618,3.014,5.4628,0.7033,0.9733,1.738,0.6232,3.4185,0.6316,2.0887,6.3737,0.0783,2.6201,5.994,4.1096,3.8085,1.2975,4.1789,0.2839,4.1747,5.6727,0.2572,0.0579,2.4602,0.7259,5.6637,0.5164,2.9553,5.8095,3.9034,3.5267,9.3767,6.7635,2.6888,1.2871,6.2898,1.3589,1.3527,1.3972,7.2254,1.3246,3.1325,0.8819,5.1515,0.0062,3.5052,3.3308,7.4827,1.2064,4.828,5.3874,0.0945,2.2048,0.519,5.5365,2.918,0.0005,4.304,3.0117,0.0006,5.5421,1.301,1.8616,0.4965,1.227,0.5303,2.1865,2.8576,1.3347,0.7142,4.4102,1.966,0.0223,5.7395,2.5882,0.3649,5.2127,3.1729,6.4737,9.105,7.0711,5.3422,5.9894,8.7864,0.2583,0.4779,7.0179,5.3583,0.0002,0.4655,1.0078,5.7877,4.9257,0.2819,4.3037,1.4912,2.6182,2.2523,4.3398,0.7216,4.6549,2.9913,3.5505,1.9131,2.6403,3.8248,2.0429,9.7861,0.4362,1.2428,4.2326,3.7904,5.244,1.2017,0.9977,4.3113,14.5034,4.0294,6.0042,5.7491,0.0807,1.1079,7.539,1.5374,6.8648,4.0345,4.3135,0.6815,2.8639,1.6376,0.5863,2.2349,5.1109,2.4823,3.1635,2.5514,4.5538,4.775,5.5799,3.0454,5.4033,2.4402,3.5334,0.0948,6.1182,1.9085,5.7264,3.3153,1.4394,2.6298,0.636,0.9389,0.6978,0.9899,1.3789,4.1671,0.3043,3.4541,0.0931,7.8812,3.3553,0.8456,3.7619,4.0689,3.3639,2.4324,2.1465,0.172,4.8257,0.4794,1.6284,2.5668,7.195,5.4447,2.3202,0.0005,3.302,2.7869,0.915,1.58,0.5524,2.9402,3.2729,3.3453,0.3079,3.0138,1.3327,3.2449,2.4217,3.2668,4.0215,1.8396,7.1272,7.3105,1.2752,2.347,3.5415,0.0185,0.9788,3.9213,0.0095,3.7077,3.6875,0.3502,5.3982,7.5611,3.7114,5.4787,1.1431,1.1939,7.8097,3.1957,0.2316,0.6724,3.8681,4.1248,0.662,6.1111,3.2144,1.2433,2.1452,2.097,0.8623,4.1654,0.8304,1.2227,6.9307,6.3685,3.8172,2.8614,6.3788,2.0131,2.1426,4.1244,2.433,1.4725,1.4428,3.7876,4.4471,2.8539,3.2488,0.0607,0.9214,0.4195,4.2415,1.4213,1.9312,0.5305,6.4478,0.7125,7.6218,6.9244,0.4743,0.0001,4.7721,3.6245,6.3434,0.1663,6.4357,1.4777,6.2289,0.6759,3.4602,0.4925,0.709,1.6694,1.8939,3.1874,2.6886,3.2713,4.4417,1.1628,4.5754,1.5025,1.3415,2.5725,2.2169,8.4778,0.0001,4.7843,0.0217,3.2071,0.7625,2.5777,1.703,1.8454,8.9894,0.0019,4.4331,1.2596,3.6741,0.854,0.3028,1.2326,3.8567,0.7879,2.0948,2.7254,5.1669,5.8357,3.4743,3.5472,7.6616,5.7595,2.3799,0.5531,3.8208,3.3962,0.001,3.0155,3.6842,2.3842,1.5164,2.5339,3.5876,9.0845,0.6536,0.1411,0.0945,5.6084,0.0009,5.3457,3.7343,0.0052,1.5832,3.8764,3.3935,3.0114,1.696,3.8344,7.1352,5.8475,8.4569,5.5908,0.1448,0.184,2.5778,0.0685,1.4512,4.4754,0.1358,5.3553,1.5402,0.6816,3.1816,2.8101,2.3087,0.0013,2.5176,1.9557,4.677,3.5665,0.8935,1.7501,7.4354,1.362,2.2346,5.2879,1.7588,0.4186,1.1002,1.2583,5.2098,0.0028,3.2883,2.4488,3.4546,2.49,0.0823,3.1881,6.7464,2.8637,6.2798,4.6161,3.5061,3.4171,2.0878,2.1826,0.6729,18.6065,0.0451,1.7051,4.45,4.8587,0.7513,4.4292,0.003,3.4526,2.1141,4.8325,1.1962,7.9947,0.2504,0.2176,8.4022,2.7509,1.353,1.1257,5.6401,3.0815,3.0825,4.3837,3.9002,3.237,6.9453,5.7346,0.903,6.0392,4.3867,1.5165,4.3085,1.3765,0.9931,9.1499,0.6557,3.4564,3.3662,3.8937,3.6676,2.4336,0.591,1.9334,1.8978,0.2103]}
{"prompt":"The Big Ten entered seven teams in the 2013 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , ranging from Indiana making its 37th trip and earning a number one seed to Minnesota making its 8th","text":"The Big Ten entered seven teams in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, ranging from Indiana making its 37th trip and earning a number one seed to Minnesota making its 8th trip in 20 years and earning a number six seed.\nThe Big Ten Conference released its 2013-14 schedule as its 55-game season began on February 2, 2014.\nWisconsin became the first Big Ten women's basketball team to win in a conference tournament since Nebraska in 1975.\nThe 2016\u201317 season was the 57th season of the Big Ten Conference men's basketball schedule. Following a conference tournament at Madison Arena in Madison, Wisconsin, Wisconsin defeated Ohio State  in the 2016 Big Ten Tournament. Wisconsin has won the Big Ten Tournament four times in five appearances.\nThe 2016\u201317 Big Ten Conference women's basketball season was the 58th for these teams.\nCollege Football Playoff selection (CFP)\n\nThe CFP is a conference-only playoff tournament that determines the conference champion. The winner of the conference playoffs advances to the CFP Tournament, which is a conference-wide Tournament for select playoff spots at a national level.\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the conference announced 11 teams that would be eligible from the conference with seven teams selected directly by conference officials and four teams selected by the end of the regular season.\nThe Big Ten and Big Eight conferences are the two largest colleges and universities conferences in the United States that are not associated with the Southeastern Conference (SEC), Big 12 Conference (Big 12), Big Ten Conference (Big Ten), ACC, Division I FBS, or Division II FBS.\nIn 2017, the conference and the Big Eight Conference announced that they would play off for at least one conference championship in an attempt to create two more CFP playoff teams for the 2018 Super Bowl. The Big Eight Conference has announced that it is planning to compete for the CFP championship in 2018, giving an eight-team CFP tournament instead of the previous seven. The Big 12 Conference confirmed plans for its first CFP Tournament appearance since 1998.\n\nBig Ten Conference Championship Series\n\nAll Big Ten Conference championship games (except Big Ten women's basketball) are decided by straight matches, with the winning team advancing to the annual Big Ten Conference Championship Game.\nThe Big Ten Conference uses a single-elimination championship series, which starts with a conference tournament that begins every two years (the Big Ten Tournament). The winners of these tournaments advance to the Big Ten Championship Game. The top four teams in the conference finish each year's conference tournament in that order as ranked in the conference poll. If a team loses only a single match in a conference tournament, their ranking is dropped by one. An eight-team tournament is always played, with any number of teams from four different conferences winning that year.

She then studied in the United States National Museum of Art in Washington, D.C., with John F. Kennedy, Jr.\nUpon getting her art degree, Barker married Richard Hanson (1907-1990), the president of a film company in New York,[8] in 1948; they had two children: James Andrew and Cynthia Margaret Hanson Barker (born 1955).\nBy the late 1950s Barker was working as a designer for a fashion house.[3] She began to work with various artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Motherwell, and Joan Mitchell. Her work in oil painting has been shown in London, New York, Paris, and Hong Kong, where she had a large studio in China.

{"prompt":"As one of the most recognisable British television advertisements of 2006 , noitulovE was one of two commercials ( the other being Sony 's Balls ) to feature in a \u00a3 200M campaign launched by","text":"As one of the most recognisable British television advertisements of 2006, noitulovE was one of two commercials ( the other being Sony's Balls ) to feature in a \u00a3 200M campaign launched by British Gas advertising director, Phil Clark, following that company's sale to Royal Dutch Shell.\nThe campaign was intended to encourage consumers to move to British Gas rather than Shell, although, in the year before, the two companies had made joint announcements that they would enter into a long-term strategic partnership.\nThe campaign saw two men, played by Gary Oldman and Simon Pegg, appearing on television in a series of short advertising videos, with each offering a different argument for why Shell would be the better company to buy :\nThe first version featured Oldman, the'Shell'spokesman, selling Shell as the'green alternative'who was willing to give anything for money - he even went down the'rabbit hole'to say that he was prepared to give up'his soul '.The second version was a parody by Simon Pegg of a series of videos from Shell themselves produced in which they had attempted to persuade potential buyers that if they had to choose between the two companies ( their rival had not yet been announced ) Shell should be chosen.\nThe BBC, for example, commented at the time that this'parody was particularly good ', while the Daily Mail's television critic wrote that his favourite moment was when Oldman appeared in a'bizarrely sexy bikini ', while the Advertising Age's director of television advertising wrote that the advert was'clever, absurd and very funny '.\nOne of the criticisms often made of Oldman was, of course, that he looked - and acted - as if he was about seventy-six rather than only sixty-five, and the BBC announced in September 2005 that the advertising agency involved, BBDO, were planning another version featuring the actor in a fifty-year-old avatar in order to try to address this criticism.\nDespite the criticism of his age the BBC were pleased to say that Oldman was'a star of the best kind'in terms of attracting attention to the ads and that they were pleased that he was not only appearing in two ads in one campaign, but that he had been given the unusual role of two of the brand ambassadors in the advertising.\nOldman told Sky News on 27 January 2006 that he was delighted to be involved in noitleovE :\nBut there was no real need to give him a new look in order to play the part - in fact I was more than happy for it to be him in his'best self '.\nDespite the fact that no title of noitleovE was taken from any book, Oldman did use a phrase from one during the performance :\nIt had already been suggested that noite was a corruption of'noite ', meaning'night '.","token_len":583,"entropy":[5.4146,1.3522,0.6006,2.2338,7.647,0.027,5.0911,5.5188,8.4989,1.7989,6.5936,0.1954,7.963,11.2082,13.2487,8.2146,14.2953,3.4237,3.4569,0.0252,5.4437,2.9781,5.5018,8.8509,0.2269,0.3923,9.257,0.403,13.1191,3.9575,2.2177,1.5069,4.6885,2.5586,6.4877,11.9793,6.5356,6.0111,5.3668,0.7651,4.689,7.5792,5.4948,3.9564,4.1834,5.389,6.7628,1.4736,5.3237,5.6556,4.8124,0.0892,4.2177,1.1248,5.0572,1.0619,0.0358,1.3516,0.9978,6.6489,4.3817,1.7779,4.2688,0.2008,3.5327,2.7178,0.1129,5.3268,1.3264,4.7603,0.1198,5.3351,0.0122,3.287,1.5675,4.4746,4.2489,2.0868,2.2105,6.8326,2.068,1.0011,1.4782,5.0424,0.5224,1.262,4.1799,5.4755,4.7079,1.9017,0.7722,1.0386,5.2701,1.265,0.5969,3.7218,0.0644,0.1179,4.6529,0.1841,0.7805,0.8043,1.8425,2.5847,4.7469,4.4074,4.2333,2.2551,6.6817,0.04,5.1618,2.4713,0.0879,0.5805,4.9191,2.99,0.0012,0.0937,7.2096,1.3364,3.6091,2.262,2.3649,4.1024,0.2406,4.342,7.0578,3.6569,2.0333,3.0453,3.0358,4.3658,1.0599,1.4677,5.5135,1.1727,2.4979,3.317,3.108,1.5835,1.8234,1.26,1.9593,1.5163,1.475,10.7299,1.2441,2.4357,2.024,7.055,2.6143,3.9248,0.0014,2.3387,3.4859,13.8826,7.196,2.3077,12.1121,9.1463,1.5511,1.6446,6.5242,3.7629,5.8141,1.935,5.5806,6.0285,4.819,1.5092,8.8049,2.968,5.0338,0.0329,3.3658,6.2473,1.8482,4.5668,5.0531,4.4065,2.9842,3.2524,7.0733,2.4492,9.6046,7.0286,1.2719,0.7782,12.5348,6.9986,4.2802,2.7858,2.104,1.5651,5.6095,0.1337,1.5964,2.7504,6.27,4.0235,7.7872,7.8717,5.2368,0.2784,0.4766,2.56,2.2909,4.5431,5.4569,3.0972,0.0213,0.0003,1.8477,1.9917,5.5086,0.1733,4.2756,2.8546,3.0458,10.7624,6.7879,2.2037,2.5921,1.2608,3.8019,5.8107,0.0641,2.8935,5.8896,1.9794,1.4103,4.0999,0.6907,3.1824,2.6345,2.9381,0.8126,2.3516,1.2676,0.6496,5.0878,7.2285,6.5238,4.9767,4.483,2.9119,2.251,3.3919,1.5728,2.8669,4.357,0.8632,3.9852,2.9914,1.1271,1.5041,4.8195,3.694,4.2737,2.2122,0.0485,6.5571,4.5036,0.1088,0.1309,0.6292,3.9346,7.7647,6.2328,0.1695,1.9035,5.2538,5.0419,7.296,4.8988,1.8614,4.7226,0.6577,3.6704,8.2947,2.6982,4.7107,0.9418,6.5925,4.8177,5.33,1.4005,1.3771,2.697,0.0014,3.7781,2.7269,1.0394,8.0293,5.1487,2.7346,3.0631,6.2922,4.3016,7.5023,2.4433,1.6442,6.9029,6.0708,1.7959,6.1199,0.4186,4.0576,4.5602,3.0707,0.6429,1.6076,2.6142,0.9964,6.4212,8.5747,0.11,2.3633,8.5033,0.454,4.4818,1.0864,2.5299,0.5032,4.5049,0.8613,0.2133,6.8829,7.276,1.6341,0.9713,4.0763,0.0006,1.5672,5.2083,2.1327,0.0295,0.0053,0.4835,0.6842,5.0952,7.8183,1.432,3.2067,0.1244,2.5037,0.4596,0.1638,1.6586,5.1323,10.7737,1.181,2.9496,6.661,0.0103,6.7364,1.526,1.7177,1.5878,1.6337,1.5788,2.9003,2.3925,7.8078,2.1314,3.8854,3.4653,0.1115,2.4053,3.665,4.0802,7.0648,4.0243,7.5477,1.6247,0.4159,5.2742,4.0844,5.7562,5.5142,5.9621,2.3165,3.0222,2.4279,0.7022,8.5647,0.2819,4.1553,0.6306,0.0256,10.9927,4.5851,4.006,0.0292,4.4845,1.4587,6.8638,1.4276,3.1587,0.3234,0.4458,4.8161,1.2962,3.9638,2.2243,3.5401,3.9856,6.4238,2.3962,5.9066,5.0167,1.0517,4.5942,0.3705,2.2349,0.001,1.1499,7.3174,3.4942,4.9187,2.7388,0.9295,6.6107,5.0425,1.7566,5.2622,3.785,0.0027,5.8275,4.5,1.4263,1.2049,5.9209,1.9804,2.3093,1.9996,1.1353,4.3152,1.7337,1.4333,0.9359,3.61,3.3306,4.4682,0.843,4.5507,3.0913,2.6951,2.6234,4.3613,0.8448,0.18,2.0142,0.6268,1.7263,2.2432,3.4676,1.4952,7.314,3.2514,0.1042,7.0892,3.4328,0.2888,7.4729,4.9841,2.3639,1.1405,2.8636,2.1004,0.3742,3.1228,0.0025,5.5889,5.5545,0.3217,3.0795,5.0938,2.6304,0.4325,0.557,0.6747,1.2088,4.0234,1.1643,0.9155,3.6121,0.4561,10.0618,8.6686,6.9771,0.0757,5.6832,0.5067,6.7388,3.3785,1.3493,3.6986,5.4776,4.715,0.9672,3.967,1.7837,1.5179,3.3473,4.8945,3.2068,4.3751,0.076,5.2579,1.6173,1.1606,4.4007,4.2305,0.5608,2.2368,2.1999,4.854,2.4415,0.2947,3.9922,3.787,0.488,0.7413,3.6299,3.079,3.4749,7.9625,5.4684,5.4975,6.4563,0.768,5.3961,1.1255,2.6926,0.0501,2.8724,6.5713,3.2428,0.8495,0.1441,0.0958,0.0303,1.1117,6.6338,2.8191,2.3927,5.8238,1.7575,3.1186,0.0012,3.0483,5.0535,2.1103,5.7638,2.2874,3.1405,8.8203,1.2317,6.8825,3.8278,1.3873,3.4284,4.8259,5.039,0.4922,3.086,0.7649,3.9259,8.2157,3.8581,2.4094,9.1684,0.4823,9.6159,2.8422,1.6137,4.8374,4.8773,4.8861,9.3721,8.9615]}

This flight service, operated with an Airbus A-218 aircraft, had some difficulties being accepted initially by the Icelandic public, due to a lack of public awareness about Iceland and a poor reputation for the country.\nIn May 2002, the airline announced that it would be launching flights to the United States in the summer of 2002 (on the same day that United Airlines ceased scheduled passenger flights to Iceland). The airline chose to base much of its transatlantic service on a joint venture company formed with Transair of Canada which also has a monopoly on charter flights to North America. With the airline's own fleet of four Airbus A-340-300 aircraft, Loftleidir aims to be the first long distance airline to fly from Iceland. In February 2004, the plane with the four passengers, the pilot and the aircraft mechanic crashed during its third flight, killing all passengers and the pilot.\nIn the summer of 2007, the Icelandic airline company has decided to stop flying to New York and Chicago. \nAirbus A330-200 (200 seats)\n\nAirbus A321 (193 seats)\n\nAirbus A340-300 (300 seats)\n\nAirbus A340-500 (330 seats)\nAirbus

{"prompt":"Weir assembled and trained his battalion at the Morphettville Racecourse , then embarked with them on the transport Ascanius on 20 October 1914 as the first convoy of Australian troops departed for overseas service .","text":"Weir assembled and trained his battalion at the Morphettville Racecourse, then embarked with them on the transport Ascanius on 20 October 1914 as the first convoy of Australian troops departed for overseas service. The Australian military history website notes that Australia's first overseas trip saw \" 1,700 Australian troops, including 300 sick and wounded, embarking on Ascanius in Morphettville, Victoria, to be taken to England for training\". During the evacuation the crew of Ascanius were captured by the Germans and some were tortured. The ship was then used as a base for German naval operations in the Pacific until captured by Japanese forces and taken to the Philippines.\nThe Ascanius was towed to Brisbane where a new crew towed her to Melbourne before she was sold to the German owner and exchanged for eight L\u00fctzow-class battleships, two U-boats and one LGM-class submarine.\nOn 5 December 1915, the ship was sold to William Tredway, who renamed the vessel the Vautour and used her to trade in pearls with China. She then changed ownership again, this time to a Chinese merchant, Mr Chang. With her changing ownership, the name of the ship and her route also changed, sailing through the Straits of Magellan, passing close to Isla Navarino and Isla de Terra del Fuego. On 31 January 1916, she arrived at Shanghai in China. Two days in China changed the life of Vautour and ended the voyage of the ship when she was sunk by German U-boat U-3 on 31 March 1916. She was picked up by another U-boat. The crew of 10 men were rescued by the crews of British and Argentine whalers, including the lifeboat pilot, Harry McCormac, who received the Victoria Cross for his actions. They left China and went to England. By May 1917, one crew had been transported to Britain on the SS\u00a0Canberra. The other crew members were returned to China from Shanghai where they embarked on the SS\u00a0Rural Park and arrived in Australia on 2 June 1917.\nIn the early 1920s Vautour was transferred to Canada, to William McIntyre, who used her as a pleasure yacht until she was broken up in 1928.\nIn February 2011, when Vautour was moored in the waters of South Melbourne, a shipwreck was discovered below her hull. Following a full assessment, a shipwreck recovery operation commenced on 5 March 2011 using a remotely operated vehicle. As a precaution, the vessel was taken in as a warship on 9 March and then transferred to Puget Sound in the U.S. for her restoration.

{"prompt":"Claire is a lobbyist who runs an environmental group while serving as her husband 's primary accomplice . After President Garrett Walker ( Michel Gill ) goes back on his promise to make Frank Secretary","text":"Claire is a lobbyist who runs an environmental group while serving as her husband's primary accomplice. After President Garrett Walker ( Michel Gill ) goes back on his promise to make Frank Secretary of the Army, Claire runs up against the difficulties of competing with Frank for the job. However, the President still does not want to nominate Frank, and when Frank's campaign is sabotaged, Claire is forced to confront the President, who has decided to nominate Frank anyway.\nAs the campaign gets closer, Frank becomes increasingly concerned with how the election plays out because he is convinced that his campaign is more important than anything to the country. After Frank and Claire are forced to compete in the race against one another, Frank is faced with a conflict of being loyal to his family and being a supporter of the President's plans to end the civil war.\nThe film features appearances by actors such as Susan Sarandon, Kathy Bates, Peter O'Toole, Diane Keaton, Denholm Elliott, Edward Norton, and James Fox. The character's face shape was changed for the film so that it looked more like a woman, using makeup. The actor played a character he considered an archetype but not an example he wanted to be, so he researched other characters as well.\nHe has previously stated that the film was influenced by his personal experiences of gender discrimination. To prepare for his role, he was instructed by the director to wear a shirt without a neck tape and a pair of boxer shorts, and a short dress coat. He was also given an ensemble for Frank to wear in the scenes involving himself with a woman to help visualize himself as a different gender.\nThe film was also based on the book A Practical Mind from which a sequel, A Practical Mind 2 was published in This book details much of what Frank does during the film.\nDiane Keaton portrayed Frank's mother, and although it was originally supposed to feature Edward Norton portraying this character, he was replaced with John Malkovich ; the director wanted more depth to Frank.\nThis film had significant success worldwide, grossing more than 1 billion US dollars worldwide.

{"prompt":"As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris had predicted two weeks of stormy weather , some Wehrmacht commanders were away from the front attending war games in Rennes , and many soldiers had been given","text":"As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris had predicted two weeks of stormy weather, some Wehrmacht commanders were away from the front attending war games in Rennes, and many soldiers had been given weekend off from their duties. A few hundred British soldiers took advantage of these conditions, and marched into their base at Verson. For some of these troops, the weekend was short, and by the early morning of Saturday 28th March, they were under fire from an SS battalion defending Angers. The British units counterattacked and the attackers were driven off, and their commander, Lt. Col. J. P. Bland, was killed, as were two other officers and three other non-comms personnel. A total of 17 Brit-ish and 6 French soldiers were killed on the first day of the battle. Although it was reported that the battle was won, this was not true. Two of the British soldiers actually died on the battlefield, although the casualties attributed to British units were later put at 13 killed, and another 28 wounded. As the tide of the war turned against the Allies, the British suffered from lack of transport material, and thus the casualties were small compared to other British units who were still fighting in Italy and France. The Battle of Angers ended with about three thousand Japanese casualties out of a total British of between two to four hundred casualties.\nThe Japanese also learned of a French plan to cross the Loire into Normandy to aid the Allies, and in order to prevent it from coming to fruition the Allied intelligence service in London organised a bombing raid on a bridge over the river at Vassy. This was quickly countered by a similar attack by British pilots on the French naval base at Rochefort. This was the last major strike planned by the Allies until the invasion of Normandy in October.\nBy now the Luftwaffe had exhausted the first and second wave of their supply planes, and had been unable to take on a large force of Allied troops through the blockade of the Loire Valley by British artillery and naval ships. An additional supply force of twenty-five L\u00fcneburger Stukas arrived in Brittany at the end of March, which resulted in an overwhelming force of seventy-five Stukas operating mainly from La Rochelle, but having to use the airfield at Blaye as a base of supply. These Stukas were able to drop fuel and supplies on the beachhead despite the presence of Allied patrols of Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and in a week fifty-eight Stukas had delivered thirty thousand gallons of oil and fuel to the British garrison at Savenay. However by the end of March, the Luftwaffe had not been able to overcome the British blockade with any meaningful effort. As the Allied armies moved across England and on to Normandy, the Luftwaffe only managed to deliver one thousand gallons of oil per day into Brittany.","token_len":591,"entropy":[2.9307,11.9245,1.1743,0.0066,0.0002,11.1186,2.0565,5.3176,1.3109,5.6208,4.2894,5.7923,5.1291,2.9685,5.5429,5.7168,1.253,0.5061,1.2177,5.2809,13.0232,0.4427,0.0619,0.0012,3.8761,1.6758,9.2037,2.1902,1.0741,4.1546,12.9491,6.0877,0.6146,1.973,5.9738,1.2128,1.6175,2.4167,4.2311,3.6183,2.2782,1.538,5.0592,7.8389,2.2794,2.1048,1.6457,2.4084,1.1846,4.3579,2.2569,4.1394,5.2128,1.3574,4.992,5.6617,0.0725,2.8906,2.8174,1.6593,1.6749,6.2242,1.9848,5.3874,4.1,2.3119,4.7873,13.92,2.56,5.2766,2.6586,2.5504,2.6998,2.1968,0.4219,1.2644,6.6317,0.8574,6.224,1.2534,1.0017,5.6032,1.0058,4.1563,1.3299,0.7925,3.2783,6.0973,1.9676,2.4368,1.0234,2.1627,1.0507,4.8015,3.9474,0.4408,3.7944,5.9983,5.5563,7.0743,10.2519,0.7838,1.8464,1.8746,4.3757,5.4653,9.027,1.667,0.0378,1.6839,2.7649,6.342,1.1729,2.4454,2.1971,2.2544,2.3995,4.6399,4.169,0.765,3.8826,0.9673,1.5798,0.0467,4.1469,0.2743,3.7166,0.0631,8.9954,0.9351,1.2319,1.399,3.0617,3.6823,1.4506,2.6378,1.2638,1.8428,1.4902,1.8156,3.765,7.183,0.2447,0.2871,13.388,4.6364,0.3337,3.7334,4.4052,0.0203,4.4293,5.7842,4.1924,5.7606,2.763,3.9535,1.6879,1.3967,0.4129,0.8943,3.3075,0.7542,4.7569,0.3732,0.4929,0.5113,2.4284,0.6323,5.1746,3.6429,0.4832,4.5367,0.5144,1.5086,3.72,1.2436,2.4482,1.25,3.4346,1.0088,1.0171,3.2061,0.4685,5.3144,2.2136,0.1398,2.3445,2.6284,6.9484,1.2899,2.0129,0.246,4.1079,1.1537,4.124,1.7226,4.0004,7.1608,0.0387,4.5723,2.8851,0.8033,4.8225,6.0485,1.0718,4.7164,5.331,1.9132,2.5272,5.202,5.5939,0.5487,0.3579,4.4675,1.4199,6.5436,1.5216,1.3264,1.7349,1.4336,1.2323,0.4736,2.1722,0.3909,1.3229,2.2388,4.3228,3.0519,5.7803,0.0327,5.3641,9.142,1.1599,1.1603,5.5605,2.2757,5.089,1.2116,4.6378,2.8555,0.3789,3.477,3.5557,1.8534,4.2688,1.5155,3.4207,0.8081,1.5716,5.4246,1.7268,1.8806,0.2759,1.895,3.9776,0.1154,3.2099,0.0022,5.988,1.6858,4.6943,4.7065,1.2878,6.8996,2.2668,8.0758,0.0165,1.4428,0.1191,6.7237,3.9746,5.4116,4.873,3.6853,1.6569,2.3729,4.834,0.5006,2.0487,5.5852,4.0882,4.6007,7.213,1.403,3.879,4.8368,3.1052,0.3523,5.6225,0.3953,5.4651,0.0104,5.6241,4.443,3.1922,5.3247,0.9311,1.7011,2.1876,1.2448,3.3183,4.0219,0.0507,3.5133,4.3913,1.19,3.7598,0.2695,2.4902,2.6848,3.3801,7.0308,2.1926,3.7106,3.4369,6.8791,0.6066,6.2731,2.354,0.5938,2.9237,5.9647,1.8018,0.3292,3.0761,3.3853,4.1789,9.5339,1.1259,2.257,1.2207,5.3838,5.9035,0.1124,1.644,4.3897,1.6284,1.8972,3.388,5.6531,1.5334,1.1702,1.8433,4.7006,0.6958,0.6654,6.9115,0.7847,1.2028,2.5006,1.4797,2.6881,2.2715,1.5962,5.962,5.6423,1.1868,0.3234,1.8043,3.8873,1.0707,4.9823,0.1197,0.9572,1.3851,2.8322,2.8767,1.5723,4.3192,5.1537,1.0912,4.7657,0.002,0.0036,0.0007,0.5379,5.9572,2.4875,5.8083,3.7997,1.8106,4.0275,0.0374,3.2158,5.6196,5.5223,0.8435,0.5932,2.4991,2.5689,2.8887,0.0237,3.92,3.2609,2.9576,2.2222,3.1242,0.6792,2.6692,2.0557,6.2235,0.589,8.03,0.7957,1.0443,2.2572,0.0025,6.7056,4.3606,3.813,5.8145,2.2386,3.0732,3.0318,0.208,5.6104,3.7879,4.4778,3.6558,1.4122,5.6017,1.3369,0.9862,6.9945,6.556,3.5868,7.9703,3.5453,5.9723,7.0627,1.1679,4.456,1.5405,5.7621,2.7736,1.0287,1.1132,0.0007,2.2491,0.9525,3.6179,3.9918,0.0067,2.6007,4.2488,3.7668,0.2545,7.3389,0.6494,0.9973,5.8318,0.1241,0.0109,6.229,7.2427,1.906,6.8103,2.7744,0.0588,1.5986,3.8553,5.3038,3.8217,4.4681,2.1768,4.8814,1.6237,1.8028,5.5016,7.9785,2.8655,1.8167,1.5381,1.711,6.6935,0.8632,3.6388,1.7988,0.0095,0.0027,1.1302,3.5245,0.0167,5.6676,6.4409,1.9159,2.1343,1.9599,0.7264,5.2363,3.6527,7.7965,1.0169,3.5366,0.0061,2.9254,4.7605,4.6314,5.9081,0.0168,0.1023,0.0059,5.1332,1.5333,1.9627,1.1409,3.765,3.1249,6.1595,7.9129,0.9677,1.9583,2.4294,0.01,0.0029,1.6868,6.3613,4.9511,2.6021,2.815,0.0695,4.0001,1.4819,2.9716,0.7153,0.8628,3.234,4.2527,1.2471,6.029,8.9632,4.5617,0.7015,4.7712,5.2634,0.7528,0.6117,0.0034,1.6988,1.3164,1.1604,1.3063,0.0018,0.0035,0.0016,0.3458,4.3182,2.2839,0.1499,0.0112,6.0294,0.4961,3.5297,0.941,4.6999,2.3658,7.372,4.9019,0.8465,3.8896,1.299,2.9412,3.7494,2.8166,4.0837,5.773,1.1512,5.6707,0.1609,1.9454,0.4785,0.9925,1.2905,0.0017,0.0055,0.0025,7.4488,2.4623,0.1732,5.0112,2.7065,3.7577,2.1785,0.1546,1.3227,3.2787,0.2867,5.5226,4.4471,1.3514]}
{"prompt":"Beginning in 1986 , the game was ported to numerous platforms with different companies handling the conversions ; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts , Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions","text":"Beginning in 1986, the game was ported to numerous platforms with different companies handling the conversions ; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts, Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions and a PS2 version was distributed by Sony Computer Entertainment from 2002 onwards. In 1999, the game finally received several ports to Mac and PC, notably Microsoft Windows 95, and the original Apple Macintosh, the very first release being conducted by a public company rather than exclusively by the game\u2019s original publisher.\nIn 2013, the game was remastered for the PlayStation 4, with new graphics, soundtrack and dialogue. The Japanese version was released by SEGA in Japanese SEGA Saturn in 2004. In addition, the game has been ported to several other consoles such as the GameBoy Advance, the Super NES, the PS3, the PlayStation Portable, as well as the Nintendo Wii, both in Japanese and English.\nGhost in the Shell began as the manga of the same name by Masaki Kyouko. It was first published by Shueisha in 1988 in serial form and continued for more than fifteen years. Kyouko created an anime adaptation based on the manga, produced by Nippon Television Network. The anime is now in its 24th season and continues to be produced.\nThe game\u2019s plot revolves around a cyborg officer called Major Kusanagi, and her investigation of a crime. Her investigation culminates in the case of Shiro Omi, a computer hacker who is the original target of Kusanagi. Omi escapes from prison, and Kusanagi must work to track him down and discover how he was able to do this. The story is heavily influenced by science fiction literature, including the novels of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, especially 1984 ; in fact, the manga even depicts Omi as a character from that novel. It is generally assumed that Omi was inspired by the character Roy Batty from the novel Blade Runner.\nAccording to an in-depth interview in the Tokyo Game Show, Masaki Kyouko was reluctant to make the game, and it took her over seven years to produce. She took inspiration for the character of Major Kusanagi, but it was never her intent to create a realistic character. She described the character as a robot, but also a woman. Kyouko also cited the influence of anime in the creation of the game. She was also interested in the film The Fifth Element and in its depiction of the relationship between the human and the machine. Masaki Kyouko was inspired by science fiction literature and anime as well as by the film The Fifth Element, which she described as an influence for the characters in the game Ghost in the Shell.\nThe game is written and directed by Mamoru Oshii, and is set largely in the future. This is true of the entire manga series, although it was later expanded into the anime adaptation.","token_len":591,"entropy":[3.4943,6.4378,0.2023,1.3567,7.932,1.0888,5.7216,0.2208,7.03,1.4466,4.4631,4.0056,8.7981,6.7291,0.8327,7.7663,11.9893,6.9521,8.6079,4.8245,0.961,4.8775,3.0886,5.1482,0.0484,1.6831,10.0042,3.2667,9.6016,8.5176,3.9466,6.3868,11.7564,3.7561,2.4829,2.5021,5.4813,1.2553,0.8682,0.4853,6.3301,0.5889,2.6355,1.5971,0.0023,6.9477,4.585,3.857,0.2622,3.1254,3.7261,0.4191,1.3438,0.9949,5.2082,2.3859,7.7417,4.4589,2.4518,6.1441,1.1339,0.9261,1.4867,5.6827,7.3177,2.6023,4.9711,2.1421,2.2638,2.0309,3.0788,6.9579,0.6841,3.3929,3.4716,5.4941,0.2601,4.2348,3.2387,8.8818,0.9652,4.047,6.6838,1.3564,6.3966,0.0626,8.3612,0.796,1.816,2.5953,16.8879,7.0479,6.8278,3.2609,1.9195,0.5085,1.3545,6.3043,5.6646,0.2184,1.2953,1.1428,0.5601,3.4331,0.6889,1.6405,1.1304,2.2496,1.4905,1.6465,2.4328,2.3683,1.7852,1.3088,4.9585,0.9014,5.9752,2.283,1.6713,6.6626,0.8606,1.2651,0.6437,3.5434,4.4718,0.62,1.401,6.1607,9.4011,1.4182,6.6609,3.7044,4.1037,1.0374,2.3468,3.5872,0.477,0.9758,1.0464,2.2772,0.4947,1.4982,0.2347,2.9664,1.5994,2.6227,3.0022,0.0022,0.64,3.2799,3.0978,0.5704,0.4547,2.6332,5.6677,2.203,0.4787,1.1699,4.8377,1.0542,0.3784,0.8564,3.1057,2.0842,0.5076,5.7411,0.0161,0.0016,1.0178,1.6746,2.3752,1.7358,5.2925,2.7492,2.3816,0.2159,0.9314,0.3859,0.954,9.5702,2.1021,0.0166,0.0122,7.3544,1.36,2.7149,6.0732,1.5643,1.5803,0.7517,0.0755,1.6805,3.5433,4.015,2.7947,5.1917,1.3667,1.5818,1.7245,0.84,3.1696,0.4884,2.3352,2.9455,0.3346,0.0059,0.4011,4.2926,3.3563,7.1225,1.9682,1.8384,4.9001,3.428,3.079,0.046,4.4917,0.0877,1.0744,4.8799,0.0379,0.0006,4.4042,3.7765,2.3271,1.8129,3.0235,0.0961,0.2771,0.8642,1.5939,6.4582,0.6389,4.2148,1.4268,0.0011,4.4197,5.3148,2.3584,1.3166,2.0651,3.4521,3.0324,1.7154,1.5295,4.0228,0.0193,0.4993,1.7542,4.1767,0.6658,1.8545,2.7198,3.1899,1.0755,2.0341,1.0858,13.3762,0.6488,0.0409,5.1424,1.7857,0.0077,0.9558,7.685,0.016,7.4605,3.511,6.3228,3.0854,0.5277,0.0004,1.1563,4.2552,3.316,6.6931,1.7731,1.8889,3.881,3.6243,3.8226,2.4587,6.1591,0.0034,0.3611,1.2647,5.7905,0.121,5.5265,3.0643,4.9383,4.6157,0.7081,1.1141,5.4845,1.3221,0.7643,1.9104,3.4746,4.958,2.6894,0.1265,4.5544,0.0003,0.0001,4.1511,2.5794,0.0139,6.5961,1.7417,1.907,2.0692,1.6725,4.0579,0.0007,0.0002,5.5418,3.3312,1.0747,4.2837,0.7401,0.1228,1.5943,6.171,3.8809,1.0215,2.8493,0.7289,0.0011,4.179,2.5768,0.4609,2.0084,2.5415,1.8612,5.0962,1.1722,0.0608,7.637,0.0407,5.2826,1.0897,2.5679,1.5123,2.9013,0.9053,4.0912,4.1205,0.0039,0.0001,1.1439,5.262,0.0626,1.2403,0.0064,0.0104,1.0735,6.4244,9.3341,11.1593,4.1124,2.3213,0.1098,1.2575,4.2199,6.6989,4.7371,4.1232,0.0133,0.7652,0.8056,3.8361,2.3335,3.3904,2.7393,0.8065,3.7701,0.8921,6.3231,1.8984,0.1247,1.4449,0.005,1.662,3.7415,0.1393,1.235,4.0342,9.2835,4.9932,0.8745,2.6069,0.8539,2.45,6.465,0.3137,1.5724,0.9409,4.8445,0.0075,3.9618,5.6454,0.0701,2.5548,1.6957,3.589,1.2298,5.1983,1.4284,0.7634,1.379,4.8899,0.2534,0.3749,0.0025,0.0008,2.7589,6.6824,0.0715,2.377,1.548,0.4568,2.3761,2.3866,3.9465,3.6184,5.3943,5.0166,3.8152,0.088,0.2745,3.2447,1.682,2.3999,4.9572,5.5887,4.5119,0.5789,3.6948,2.9014,1.6573,0.2191,0.001,0.0001,2.7775,2.9708,2.992,0.7897,3.5471,3.7074,3.2516,0.1335,3.0438,0.6389,7.1079,2.7893,0.8576,2.3849,6.7319,1.3088,1.5667,0.2981,1.5572,4.9474,1.7732,2.571,3.8679,2.7343,4.0047,1.737,3.173,0.0101,0.0006,2.8235,5.5321,1.2359,5.3145,0.0649,4.0172,2.992,1.4115,3.8968,0.0418,0.5317,1.1439,1.5212,2.396,3.5941,2.3223,3.384,0.0258,1.2062,5.8928,4.3535,5.6925,0.433,2.3836,3.7364,3.9453,3.6779,0.0267,1.4243,5.2949,0.0321,1.6891,2.618,0.6035,0.5808,3.1498,0.7096,5.8116,0.0317,1.1295,0.0046,0.0007,2.0184,4.0625,0.285,5.9751,0.0365,2.0391,1.5933,4.4275,2.9181,0.4949,0.4529,3.4549,1.2455,3.6022,1.594,1.5563,0.0128,1.2821,1.4364,1.9483,3.2716,0.0823,2.5653,5.6175,3.7124,0.7894,3.9773,2.3002,0.3582,1.3481,12.6092,0.0308,0.015,0.0022,0.4864,0.7468,1.7267,0.7567,2.2168,4.7175,1.6045,1.665,0.016,6.6373,0.0138,0.4536,0.0149,1.1161,1.5575,2.0681,3.3245,8.2618,0.286,0.9194,3.5286,1.2715,4.7655,1.4252,6.051,1.2148,1.0854,4.3328,3.4064,3.1481,0.8755,3.1441,2.0518,2.8002,3.0244,2.4779,1.7512,2.3108,1.5859,3.7896,0.9675]}
{"prompt":"Sushruta , the great surgeon and author of the Sushruta Samhita , the Sanskrit text of surgery , lived in Varanasi and practised medicine and surgery sometime during the 5th century BC . Since 1922","text":"Sushruta, the great surgeon and author of the Sushruta Samhita, the Sanskrit text of surgery, lived in Varanasi and practised medicine and surgery sometime during the 5th century BC. Since 1922, at the request of the Indian Government, many important texts, including the Sushruta Samhita and the Bhavishya Tantra have been excavated at Sankara Maharajpur, some twenty kilometres south of the city of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. Most of these texts date back to the 3rd and 2nd century BC. One such text, the Sushruta Samhita which is now available (in Sanskrit) and translated into several languages, is written in an elegant, precise and meticulous style. All the text uses a combination of ancient Sanskrit terms (a subset of which are still used today in the Indian subcontinent ) for surgical procedures and is one of the best-known medical treatises ever written.\nThe ancient text states clearly that the body of the patient must be bathed as well as the instruments and needles before the operation begins. It was generally thought that only a female practitioner could perform the surgery. However, no evidence in classical texts can be found indicating so.\nFrom a number of different sources we have been able to build a picture of the workings of the ancient surgeon who performed his surgery in a simple wooden theatre. He would use the wooden theatre as a bed and would use a long wooden instrument called a prathapa to help secure the patient in a certain position during the operation. The bed would be set up so that the patient was lying on their left side and the surgeon would be on the right. There would also be a long wooden platform on which a number of instruments including needles and forceps were placed. The theatre was lit with candles which would form part of the medical team. While the surgery was being performed, the patient would be under the control of the doctor and would be observed by one of the assistants named Krodha who would pass on any messages to the doctor and also to one of the sons of God named Vashishtha who would be stationed above the patient. The latter would communicate with God regarding the procedure.\nOnce the surgical procedure was completed, the patient was released from the bed and would then be taken to the bathroom which was called a shala. The bath would have contained a number of medicinal herbs with the patient having the bath on their right side. On removing their clothes, the patient would be laid on the mat called a bhadra.

{"prompt":"Mazatec shamans crush the leaves to extract leaf juices from about 20 to 80 ( about < unk > \/ 2 oz to < unk > \/ 7 oz . ) or more fresh leaves","text":"Mazatec shamans crush the leaves to extract leaf juices from about 20 to 80 ( about < unk > \/ 2 oz to < unk > \/ 7 oz. ) or more fresh leaves, and boil the resulting solution to extract a large quantity of the soluble part. This leaves only about 2 to 5 percent of the raw leaf material in the solution. This process produces a concentrated infusion, and a large volume of undissolved leaf material. The infusion is then filtered through several layers of muslin. Leaf infusion is a good candidate for a product to help people relieve nausea and discomfort caused by the common cold. Leaf infusions are commonly found in Chinese medicine stores. Leaf infusion has a characteristic aroma (like mint or spearmint) but a rather milky appearance. Leaf infusions are often sweetened. Some leaf infusions have added herbs, though most usually consist of only a few herbs, and the addition of the herbs occurs only after the infusion has been made. Leaf infusion is also sold bottled for home use at drugstores. Leaf infusion has a lower alcohol content than alcohol-based teas and, unlike tea that is bitter, leaf infusions vary in freshness, color and taste from product to product, and so is not a substitute for a freshly prepared cup of strong tea. Leaf infusion is, however, the first step in making extracts for use with herbal medicine.\nDried herbs\nMany plants are dried to aid in storage, reduce the cost of the product, or enable its more frequent use, or to ensure its better preservation when it is not desired to use the plant fresh. When used for medicinal purposes, in its dried form, an herb requires to be reduced to a powder that is easily dissolvable, and so that it does not cause the user discomfort (it must be nonirritating to the throat) by the irritation caused by a hot drink containing the herbs. Some herbs are also dried for use in flavoring soups or other beverages. Herbs are commonly found in dried form in Chinese medicine stores. Some herbs, however, require to be freshly dried, either by oven or over a gas grill. Dried herbs are widely used in many Asian cuisines because natural products have a rich flavor and long-keep value.\nConclusion\nHerbals are used as medicine or seasonings for many foods. The herbs and spices used vary from country to country and are often imported. They can be consumed as they are and provide a wide variety of color, flavors, texture, and health benefits.

He looked like a fox and was as sharp as a whip, and of course he was a fast animal. \\ he added : \\\nIt was announced, by William J. \\, the race-horse and sporting writer of the \\ Baltimore _, that Waxy was in a terrible condition. J oints were very badly shaken, though the head and body were not injured. He was breathing very strongly, there seemed to be only a moderate degree \\ of pain, but he was unconscious. With the exception of the two legs he was completely surrounded and it was impossible to remove him from the enclosure without serious risk to life. \\ He was, said Mr. ^, kept by Mr. < > G in a paddock that had been built within the enclosure. The horse was taken out, he was placed on a rough bed, and a strong current of air was blown at him after each breathing effort\\. A glass of hot water was administered to him, as there was intense agony from cold. He was kept in a room heated at 110 degrees F., but he continued unconscious through that entire period. He was put into a sitting position and rested his head on his hands until he opened his eyes. A glass of brandy and water was slowly introduced to him, and then some orange juice. At about noon he was unconscious again and another glass of brandy. water, and a little fruit juice were given and after three quarts of brandy and water the horse opened his eyes, but he did not utter a word. About one o'clock he became more conscious, and was able to open his mouth, but refused to answer to calls and seemed to be suffering great pain. The horse showed great signs of excitement and agitation and tried to escape from a trap that had been placed on his neck. A large bandage was laid on his nose.\\\nThe race-horse and sporting writer of the Philadelphia Inquirer said \\ that the horse was in extreme suffering, but he did not appear dangerous. \\ In that newspaper a correspondent wrote in the spirit of comicality that the horse wanted to be put back in the ring as he did not appear to have suffered any great injury. The race-horse and sporting writer of a Cincinnati paper wrote from the seat of the race with this heading, \\ The Waxy Horse,'which was taken from the track suffering some very severe damage, had this morning been allowed to run, in spite of protests from the medical authorities at the track. A good deal of pain was experienced, but otherwise he was unharmed. The man who jitted Waxy was badly broken up, but otherwise the horse was unharmed. \\","token_len":593,"entropy":[2.6222,5.9169,0.011,9.5247,5.6953,5.441,10.9402,10.823,4.1837,5.5382,3.3185,7.9545,8.7672,3.5848,2.5016,9.017,12.579,2.2926,5.1119,13.4588,4.5869,2.5428,0.9939,5.0049,8.7393,3.8534,1.8191,8.7238,15.0548,6.2752,4.2908,11.1841,5.8203,8.3547,0.9899,6.6295,1.8603,2.019,4.6138,8.1727,1.0132,0.9362,3.8231,2.2979,0.1688,5.7629,1.3973,3.5394,5.8946,1.5026,1.8899,3.7943,1.5839,0.5892,6.6788,3.7111,1.8108,5.2095,5.4962,0.2212,0.2633,4.2803,1.5037,1.2754,5.5453,3.2026,1.7271,1.2156,1.9193,6.9502,5.1974,1.0935,8.1339,6.9227,8.1496,3.4111,4.0469,6.1063,8.5264,0.9589,7.8504,3.669,3.3473,5.9055,4.1647,0.4989,8.8047,4.5925,3.4994,9.6656,2.9585,1.3578,4.4669,6.4997,6.1545,1.5632,1.0532,8.6854,6.3376,8.5233,3.5465,0.7744,1.8905,0.0483,1.0634,3.7591,2.9572,6.9158,1.4932,1.3112,5.0479,7.4952,10.9492,2.601,4.5948,6.086,4.9817,1.2616,5.2126,2.4844,4.6293,2.5099,2.9977,0.7689,2.9304,4.4032,0.8828,2.1433,0.9106,7.7963,1.8918,5.2482,0.9674,6.8764,4.3978,0.2011,0.0273,4.5496,0.8862,5.353,3.9669,9.8436,0.847,2.4489,1.4196,1.6073,1.9414,0.9194,5.0298,1.1888,6.4324,2.0539,2.2954,0.039,1.5021,5.4308,3.5108,2.0813,0.9653,4.2417,7.2433,2.9186,6.0223,0.5187,2.8144,0.242,5.199,1.6925,1.872,0.5046,4.7423,3.8055,5.2363,4.2932,2.0991,3.7719,0.9382,2.9815,2.3728,0.8003,5.3181,6.7337,2.7901,0.0893,5.303,1.7404,6.0217,4.109,2.959,0.0157,5.9918,7.8528,7.0573,7.7361,2.003,9.0379,0.129,4.8405,2.2178,0.6725,2.9835,6.4793,1.0344,1.9692,1.3408,2.2227,4.4398,1.1154,3.8915,2.4096,2.4652,4.3718,0.5646,3.2364,1.8824,0.808,6.851,3.2346,0.911,0.9127,3.058,5.8105,6.1898,2.2263,3.1485,0.7286,5.0486,3.8517,0.9906,6.6929,4.4731,5.5614,6.703,12.1249,3.8157,6.6029,3.671,4.4555,0.2909,0.2151,4.5863,0.6491,0.7138,1.4096,4.2022,5.0712,0.4075,7.8722,5.8254,3.8346,5.5744,1.1552,1.9873,0.5814,3.2021,1.0811,0.8597,4.0788,7.0485,3.862,6.0641,1.2487,2.4831,1.4374,3.5165,2.2662,5.406,8.1734,5.3121,5.6793,5.8805,2.1766,0.7912,2.369,0.6545,3.6306,1.6871,0.6114,6.1084,0.2587,1.9408,6.161,4.5345,0.4118,0.673,1.7963,3.1032,4.8398,1.1104,6.6593,0.2466,0.1938,0.9279,3.2509,4.7221,0.2937,7.4104,0.0063,3.51,2.6542,0.7969,6.5391,4.4016,1.749,0.9439,1.207,0.7484,2.9285,4.5649,7.7552,1.5456,3.3868,4.0442,3.2086,3.2035,1.3721,0.557,7.9605,1.7018,1.9484,7.5561,1.0737,0.2062,0.1318,0.0002,4.4118,11.0276,4.0466,2.324,1.6084,2.9499,5.5689,1.1227,0.8567,2.6854,5.5038,5.5706,4.3115,8.9687,0.0686,0.583,2.026,0.0004,2.7617,0.5433,2.583,1.5357,5.5697,0.5047,0.05,2.5192,3.0503,1.5385,2.426,0.0114,6.4117,0.2012,0.2957,0.4979,5.7105,4.3387,1.3988,0.0701,0.0016,1.8504,4.3964,4.4888,2.3747,1.4434,0.659,3.0529,3.0689,0.069,2.7448,0.1751,3.8928,2.3802,1.035,6.109,0.1681,4.7447,4.4913,6.9393,2.6889,5.7646,0.7749,1.0983,4.5181,6.247,1.947,0.6196,2.3462,2.3144,7.3619,3.5971,2.0643,0.0388,5.7416,1.2679,3.3041,2.9459,5.5413,0.2352,3.7843,1.7122,4.1666,8.257,3.8841,1.1812,0.245,1.5018,2.4663,1.4189,2.7916,0.7065,3.1945,3.1441,5.0321,2.6957,0.3993,4.3946,1.1705,0.3517,6.0544,2.5895,6.3452,4.225,3.2481,5.4771,0.5009,0.0271,3.8917,3.0729,0.1775,1.285,0.2575,5.8207,6.5764,0.0099,0.0016,3.4571,4.2155,2.0285,2.1435,2.1717,1.1022,2.2876,5.8385,4.5698,1.3133,2.0802,2.1629,2.6479,0.1316,2.8932,7.9281,1.052,1.9244,3.4437,5.135,5.6691,3.5758,5.4731,3.1309,4.1292,1.6342,8.1755,0.0299,6.9286,4.3458,4.0508,1.6154,1.6998,0.9149,8.5562,0.6429,1.795,3.1701,2.6338,1.212,0.6311,5.1397,4.3179,3.9442,3.9717,0.6105,4.5737,0.6582,1.8224,3.8885,1.4065,3.2925,2.3616,0.5175,2.2121,2.5897,0.1366,0.0043,2.6467,0.6658,0.0182,0.6557,5.2658,4.7972,1.774,2.6133,6.6721,1.4033,6.8765,0.4308,1.0156,3.3911,5.0331,3.3127,9.5582,2.3406,1.832,3.4845,5.3546,0.3891,4.1888,8.7558,8.5197,2.1447,4.2548,1.5018,0.7875,5.681,11.6115,4.4431,4.382,1.9405,4.5766,2.0463,4.6498,6.2245,6.7264,0.8426,5.5652,0.3497,2.718,3.2516,4.0135,2.9746,0.0135,9.2153,0.9657,1.1324,6.6213,3.6418,3.809,1.0854,4.0855,1.0483,3.6942,5.1544,2.0223,0.1521,3.6885,0.9391,4.0036,2.1552,1.5475,7.5172,2.1112,0.9698,4.0549,0.9456,0.0124,0.3505,1.8463,5.7324,0.841,9.9437,9.7471,4.1871,0.071,2.0199,7.7562,6.4667,2.3013,1.2484,2.1912,7.3726,3.1596,1.3481,0.7294,4.4578,0.0398,0.0097,0.3326,1.7715]}

The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September","text":"Hurricane Janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the season and one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. The hurricane formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 3, moving south through the Caribbean. Jan 02, \u00b7 Oct 26, \u00b7 Category D for Hurricane Janet, which makes for a \u2018high risk\u2019 storm in this region \u2013 the Caribbean, Cuba and South Florida, hurricane watches and warnings have been issued.\nI have always wanted to fly. It is something I'd dreamt about doing as long as I can remember. I am lucky enough to have grown up with a love for flying since I was young - we had a drone for Christmas many moons ago and a toy model plane when I was younger.\nIn 2012 I graduated from AMSM Academy with the Air Transport Flight Training in the United Kingdom at 12 months. I completed my Private Pilot License at age 22 and my Commercial Pilot License at age 26. The reason I did not complete the Private Pilot license sooner was that I didn't want to fly my full time job until I had been flying as a Private Pilot for a year. I did end up graduating in the same year that I did my full time job in 2015, but I have been flying a little while longer than I had originally planned. I have completed around 200 hours in my career.\nFor more information on learning to fly in the UK please click on the links below to visit my website and view the different flying training courses that are offered.\nDo note that some of the training courses include flights to other countries as part of their course. If your school of training in the UK is not listed, please get in touch so that I can check to see if your school can give you a quote for your flights.\nIf you don\u2019t know who\u2019s making the most money on the U.S. stock market right now, you could be missing out. This year has been a great one for some stocks and a bad one for others.\nSome of the big performers have been names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) that have continued to perform well with their technology heavy holdings as we end the year. Other big gains have come from healthcare stocks like Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).\nSome stockholders are still hoping for better returns this year.

{"prompt":"Stop ! ! Hibari @ - @ kun ! is written and illustrated by Hisashi Eguchi . Following the conclusion of his manga Hinomaru Gekij\u014d ( < unk > ) in 1981 , Eguchi wanted","text":"Stop!! Hibari @ - @ kun! is written and illustrated by Hisashi Eguchi. Following the conclusion of his manga Hinomaru Gekij\u014d ( < unk > ) in 1981, Eguchi wanted to express how the series felt while finishing it, and how the series and its characters had influenced him. In addition, Hisashi wrote his autobiography and the manga's manga companion, the manga series titled Hibari @! - @ kun!, with original illustrations. The manga was published as a 12 - volume one shot series by Sh\u016beisha, a member of the \" JUMP SQUAD\" in 1988. Hibari @! - @ kun! has been written into manga, and various character designs have been published at various times, and is now a part of the Eguchi's private collection. Hibari @! - @ kun! is a manga about a fictional boy who was left behind as he was born prematurely. His parents had already decided he will be a soldier when he reached 5 months, but when they arrived to Japan he was sent to the military childcare. After the war he was left behind in Japan, and he had spent most of his time as a young boy living in the military. After he moved to the countryside with his aunt and uncle, he meets a girl named Rieko who was left behind with her father. He had never been close to her, but he meets her and soon becomes good friends. He also meets a girl named Satoru, whose father is a medical doctor. When the first war ends he is taken hostage and sent to an internment camp to work as an electrician and also study while he waits for the next war. He meets several people who become his best friends. He was chosen as the representative of the camp to a festival held in Osaka, and was told by his grandfather to take his friend Yaguchi, but he did not even know who he was at the Festival. He starts to make a friend with Sakuyuki, a new girl in the camp. Eguchi originally wanted to write a series that focused on the romance of Yaguchi and Hibari, but he changed this to how the two of them get to know the children left behind. After the war, Yaguchi is allowed to move to an apartment after serving his sentence, but they learn his father had been deported. Hibari is finally allowed to bring himself to Osaka by taking a bus. Soon after they leave camp, he loses all family and friends. The first few volumes of the manga are very depressing and have many serious themes. But as the manga goes on the light and color becomes more prominent, and the story becomes more and more lively. Hibari became popular and went on to become a TV anime series broadcast on TV Japan as the beginning of the early - 1990's. Some of the manga covers were published in a separate series titled Hibari Manga.","token_len":595,"entropy":[9.5059,12.0712,4.4139,7.7585,7.2614,5.5437,6.2115,5.139,7.8242,7.4196,9.0269,4.979,3.8176,0.1652,8.5336,1.577,8.0336,0.3529,1.436,8.9423,1.5346,4.4457,0.0498,2.5544,2.6831,9.3732,2.8399,0.7707,4.7845,1.9398,1.7293,1.9164,2.6278,11.0973,10.273,5.2945,3.4912,1.4598,3.3182,5.7685,0.3464,7.2679,0.0,8.3327,0.1549,6.3104,4.1586,3.2639,3.2211,4.5719,4.9142,7.0828,1.1233,1.5636,1.2076,2.1432,2.2568,1.586,5.4534,1.655,2.0137,3.1671,3.3924,1.8947,1.1976,2.7397,2.8424,1.1413,7.6152,0.0019,3.5907,3.6982,6.1489,2.7217,3.5668,2.3175,2.7135,4.1979,6.9052,2.3525,3.1159,2.4815,3.4364,6.1372,3.5796,0.0323,4.498,6.4521,3.9086,1.7514,0.319,0.0105,3.1362,3.6605,6.4526,1.4983,3.5938,2.4357,1.5439,1.5929,1.2499,3.2987,0.9466,5.1968,7.9082,4.8085,6.0232,12.2987,4.7198,3.507,3.3841,4.3238,8.6008,3.2382,2.9829,4.1521,5.5297,0.0857,0.6698,4.8375,9.6655,4.1619,7.4532,0.4802,2.5921,5.559,4.9566,0.4694,5.3088,0.0047,0.607,0.1121,0.4168,0.0223,0.0441,0.0061,0.2983,3.9302,1.1462,6.2379,4.9831,4.7727,3.0314,2.4424,5.6726,5.652,0.9365,1.411,0.3605,2.6782,6.0915,1.1576,1.7313,2.4619,3.0524,2.2855,3.6291,3.1341,2.9535,0.0247,0.7977,11.4198,0.0009,3.399,7.4192,0.2991,0.5887,4.2549,0.0048,0.1749,0.0288,0.2516,0.0206,0.0326,0.0042,0.0575,1.2654,2.2035,3.3418,2.9709,1.2734,6.2264,4.1184,1.3723,3.7153,5.6535,2.3197,3.5069,3.7051,1.7092,3.77,5.1425,0.9665,2.4634,4.4312,3.3311,4.6495,4.8528,3.2828,6.0167,1.5232,1.5726,4.1807,3.0803,0.331,5.0476,5.1657,5.4627,2.6399,1.8549,2.9828,2.4126,4.347,3.3155,3.6632,2.3681,0.7886,3.7556,0.5446,2.1113,2.7996,12.5452,3.339,2.9354,2.6347,1.2902,1.7107,1.584,4.4161,1.6608,2.376,3.3759,1.0158,1.2259,3.1807,3.4012,6.2158,2.0985,0.0075,0.1077,1.2874,3.4951,0.2061,3.9385,0.7725,4.0197,1.0784,1.5665,3.3925,1.1556,2.8298,2.7446,5.4033,0.5189,1.9711,4.7416,3.8056,0.1739,5.2297,1.4678,0.5834,0.4206,0.6316,5.9825,1.7031,1.9621,0.8074,4.522,4.2905,2.0373,1.906,3.1929,5.1182,0.3308,4.1648,1.8085,2.3204,1.1237,2.3901,4.9543,3.0557,2.3389,4.4009,0.5223,0.743,1.5202,0.9107,2.3811,5.067,0.7258,2.3396,4.8209,2.1658,5.9601,0.0077,1.9853,2.1439,3.3696,1.0848,1.6962,1.4351,0.172,4.0525,3.6388,0.3088,1.3149,4.6692,2.2984,1.3154,0.7892,6.5531,1.1478,1.0655,3.162,2.4956,5.0101,4.3031,2.4871,3.1338,1.8819,3.7066,5.7398,2.0213,3.9632,0.2038,3.685,4.0609,0.0012,0.0299,3.3497,4.251,1.2233,1.913,6.0735,0.0123,3.3734,5.2175,8.2007,7.1671,1.655,3.1907,0.3011,1.1673,2.6539,0.6957,0.5121,1.546,2.642,5.6349,2.6748,1.4274,4.8104,1.0705,3.7171,0.0508,2.0341,1.6229,4.2227,5.1603,1.19,0.9354,6.0164,0.4029,0.4781,7.4542,2.543,4.6964,6.3764,2.1964,1.5353,5.0556,1.2682,1.333,3.3666,4.4279,1.2604,2.1984,4.037,2.0415,3.6288,2.8933,6.4959,6.3165,4.8819,3.7121,2.7017,3.7075,1.247,3.5423,0.1364,5.4675,1.2151,2.1587,0.7154,0.0785,4.1756,0.5978,8.1289,0.6961,1.2633,6.3658,0.929,4.3512,2.8664,4.8286,2.2372,6.2996,5.8222,1.6528,1.1114,2.5647,5.4282,3.3205,3.6068,1.0121,0.6259,1.3478,10.4148,0.0002,6.4414,1.5972,0.3445,1.4933,1.063,3.0009,3.1791,4.0364,0.236,1.3298,5.5526,1.5495,4.829,0.0595,0.0137,1.8257,8.8424,0.0023,0.5305,0.2662,1.8917,4.6939,6.0818,3.2069,6.7032,1.1929,3.0854,2.3572,0.0125,5.2364,3.8745,0.1411,5.967,7.1251,9.1245,0.0632,1.2076,3.6995,1.7075,1.4329,0.781,3.2758,0.0037,0.0036,2.6184,5.1651,0.1241,4.7942,0.8596,4.1032,2.0539,6.1771,5.7531,3.1967,2.4505,1.6051,0.9631,4.5538,5.5684,4.5797,3.6608,3.385,1.4584,5.9462,2.6247,4.66,0.0025,2.8247,4.9501,2.4663,0.0929,6.4474,6.0089,0.4822,10.7518,3.6937,4.214,1.6097,2.593,2.7337,5.8563,0.7024,3.2135,3.5563,7.9648,0.4667,1.7383,6.5222,3.8269,7.4397,1.6839,0.5049,1.8209,3.1461,3.6728,3.825,4.0864,0.5605,0.8768,0.6593,1.2611,5.0867,6.5031,1.6594,4.0845,3.2907,5.4663,2.0102,0.9887,4.8854,3.2581,0.861,1.6157,3.7232,0.0755,3.0615,6.6851,2.3366,5.0743,2.6879,1.3287,5.0611,0.994,1.0752,0.8601,2.3903,1.2711,0.2991,2.6047,0.0016,5.9253,1.0159,3.9636,0.0034,7.425,4.6119,3.5098,5.5407,0.3844,0.1188,0.756,1.0219,5.9315,1.5011,1.0106,7.6369,2.0461,3.3674,4.3821,4.63,2.69,5.5476,0.1019,0.6443,6.7023,9.2586,3.3583,1.317,0.4399,6.0508,0.6863,0.2514,2.0059,5.8428,2.0646,2.4843,1.1333,3.9363,4.7092,1.8723,3.8466,1.7668,0.011,7.2085,3.0824]}
{"prompt":"For the first two hundred years , Christians `` refused to kill in the military , in self @ - @ defense , or in the judicial system `` , but there was no official","text":"For the first two hundred years, Christians `` refused to kill in the military, in self @ - @ defense, or in the judicial system ``, but there was no official prohibition on killing, said the report.\nDuring these centuries Christians were forbidden to kill Jews, Pagans, or others who did not believe as Christians believed.\n\u201c Christians and Jews alike had to fight against Pagans. `` During the last hundred years, Christians have generally not killed each other, and Christians have generally not attacked Jews or Buddhists or Muslim or other faiths.\u201dIt was the persecution of Christians by other religions that was the focus of much reporting in history books of the time, and the persecution of Christians by the Romans.The Church of Rome during the first millennia of Christianity was not a unified church or even a religion.It was primarily a collection of separate hermit communities and churches that would become united later in the 4th Century AD.In the first millennia, a great deal of the Bible was composed of historical accounts that were largely inspired by ancient history and that later Christians took as gospel and inspiration for their own beliefs.\nAt the same time the Christian church became quite powerful, and was able to organize itself into an empire that would expand from its origins in the early Roman empire to much of the western world and as far north as the British Isles.The church could claim to be the church throughout the known world, and to claim that only it had the authority to determine who was a true faith follower.Even during the 2nd Century AD, Christianity was still growing, and was at a time of much religious ferment and persecution and violence.There were many competing religions and sects, which many Christians would describe as heresies.\nFor instance, the followers of Jesus could accuse his followers of not really believing him.Also during the first millennia, the Roman Empire as well as many other empires were at war with each other, and battles were fought in which soldiers took part in killing each other.During the 4th century, the Roman Empire began experiencing a cultural and spiritual revolution, which ultimately led to the rise of the Catholic Church, and would lead to a great deal of political and social oppression by the Catholic Church and by the pope.\nBy the end of the 4th Century AD, the Roman Empire had been disintegrated into many smaller and different empires that had come together under the rule of the Roman Catholic Church.By the time most of these empires had fallen, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, the Western world was dominated by Christianity.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the main power of Christianity was through religious orders, such as the monks and nuns.The Church was very

{"prompt":"Post @ - @ production work was handled mostly by Framestore CFC , who had worked on previous Guinness campaigns Surfer and Dreamer , and had worked with Daniel Kleinman on a number of outside","text":"Post @ - @ production work was handled mostly by Framestore CFC, who had worked on previous Guinness campaigns Surfer and Dreamer, and had worked with Daniel Kleinman on a number of outside productions, including The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, the film adaptation of the children's book The Burt Wonderstone Show. Kleinman also took on the role of director, with Bill Winder and Sean Murray, who had worked previously on the documentary Spiceworld, assisting.\n\nRelease\n\nThe film premiered at the North American International Auto Show, where it was given a standing ovation by a crowd standing in front of the marquee. Some sources have claimed that the film featured original footage shot by the main car manufacturer, Toyota. While the film contained the Toyota Camry, which did make a cameo towards the end, there is no direct footage of the cars themselves. Instead, it is the scenes of the car in front of a TV window or driving alongside cars that are the actual footage of the car.\nThe film featured the main Toyota logo and the Toyota advertisement. The car also made a cameo in the film, only seen in black and white, driving a police car. The scene occurs in a mall setting, the car driving up the sidewalk and into an empty parking space. The logo appears right alongside it. This was one of four adverts presented in the film which were chosen by Toyota Australia to be part of Toyota's branded ads, with both the Toyota and Camry vehicles appearing in others. The branded ads for Toyota appear as the film progresses.\nLike the previous films, The Incredible Toyota made a cameo appearance in the 2002 animated film Shrek 2, appearing in the song \"Oh what a lovely time\", in which it sings the verse, \"That was the best day of my life\". With voice-over narration by Will Ferrell, the opening credit reads:\nToyota Camry! Toyota's best-selling vehicle!\nOh, what a lovely time!\nYou were doing so well.\nDid you get me anything?\nYou couldn't have paid for me.\nI think this song about your car is right up Shrek's alley.\nThe song features the Camry with a blue and white Toyota flag, along with \"Show me how you feel\" by The Beatles.\n\nHome media release\n\nThe Incredible Toyota was released by Universal Studios Home Entertainment in Regionally restricted format on VHS, and Regionally unrestricted format on DVD, on May 7,, as part of the Cars DVD collection. Both discs were region 2, meaning they could only be viewed by viewers who are physically present in Australia. It appears that the DVD contains audio in English and was cut out for release elsewhere, which is rare for a TV advertisement. The DVD was later released on the United States Blu-ray Disc set on August 12, 2015, as part of the Shrek The Third Blu-ray Collection.","token_len":596,"entropy":[8.2097,6.6858,5.4842,11.5796,8.2211,5.9295,4.6779,6.5694,0.5308,9.7576,4.1701,0.0441,7.7429,7.7375,2.4782,3.6743,3.2624,4.3,0.992,5.5045,13.9354,6.0866,13.4337,2.8462,2.8031,6.671,2.9862,2.0547,1.2975,3.0136,2.6495,1.6608,7.1027,8.2374,3.5114,1.0146,3.6116,1.4222,0.0065,9.1514,4.2645,2.2876,0.5175,3.0376,6.8983,3.9003,3.73,3.9021,3.9077,1.2717,3.5084,4.3148,3.5991,0.0944,2.1098,6.1866,0.0175,0.4625,2.1471,4.237,0.1622,0.7877,0.0768,6.7325,1.5191,10.702,0.0011,1.9876,4.8293,2.1063,1.3315,1.2866,0.0454,4.652,2.3098,2.6455,6.3855,8.3573,1.9749,2.3881,5.4514,5.3046,2.7948,2.1186,1.9654,1.1509,5.9866,0.7309,1.882,5.5805,8.2129,6.595,4.6935,1.3983,8.9125,5.2207,0.9388,0.0042,8.1858,4.0486,0.0002,2.1474,2.1023,3.594,0.6576,0.5795,5.8619,0.3691,2.0064,7.8784,0.0477,2.1479,2.6064,0.4937,1.1292,4.8245,0.9971,4.4619,0.254,0.0,2.203,3.2617,2.3659,6.4863,1.4813,2.9047,0.0165,0.9664,6.8442,0.8914,6.6062,7.734,2.2995,2.0563,0.4716,1.0933,0.9571,6.7496,6.3582,1.9462,3.854,1.8964,2.4879,7.4594,7.5368,2.7869,1.1326,4.2024,1.7943,4.8546,1.7096,1.9562,6.88,3.4515,8.1024,6.9323,0.003,1.6764,3.0994,4.7497,5.3646,1.7244,2.3872,10.3425,0.0047,0.0947,0.7806,3.0437,1.5899,0.326,4.0565,3.5435,0.4595,0.5591,5.0081,4.8183,0.8006,5.0857,0.1505,2.0019,1.9504,4.6982,7.1316,1.9756,1.0192,2.705,3.0545,3.2181,0.0415,2.1404,5.0749,7.0435,4.9288,6.7808,4.6515,4.8756,2.3118,1.7412,4.3822,5.4,5.7483,1.4142,0.2271,1.6629,1.2944,0.8401,16.0413,1.3828,5.8944,2.6687,4.8492,7.2011,4.333,2.3092,1.7944,1.9153,9.2784,1.7844,1.5255,2.8434,3.5088,4.4813,0.956,0.643,0.8956,0.8912,1.7366,1.4961,6.0299,5.3604,1.0493,5.8454,1.2953,0.0604,2.0043,7.7771,2.4631,7.2283,0.8423,1.1454,1.6516,5.9875,7.8569,1.6446,1.6539,7.9902,6.3517,1.0773,4.9852,1.8564,3.827,4.1318,1.59,3.1941,1.8361,4.5257,2.9537,2.8809,1.177,2.158,0.5873,1.3696,3.9386,3.8189,5.6694,4.1671,4.8001,1.7081,3.8757,2.2695,4.0639,0.0524,5.0488,6.3175,0.3257,6.162,2.3407,0.3904,0.7406,3.8014,1.4632,4.7942,1.332,4.0787,9.1396,2.146,1.4239,3.7516,0.0018,5.9488,0.8333,6.8717,4.275,2.7192,2.7513,5.3646,1.7409,1.7445,2.1599,7.2563,0.0682,5.5536,2.5825,1.2922,9.7757,0.4191,1.6751,9.063,1.1937,4.5917,2.9685,5.2398,3.5231,2.5001,7.2775,1.7519,0.899,0.6015,20.4738,1.1225,3.3505,2.6497,0.3141,2.8077,4.2129,14.16,5.5814,1.7149,2.0711,3.2969,0.5743,0.6429,7.8874,7.1341,1.1444,6.5353,0.5311,1.4594,1.1569,4.5249,1.4981,0.8594,7.5571,0.5657,5.8291,8.3872,0.4615,4.3912,3.4883,4.3188,3.2934,0.4692,2.9037,5.0229,2.3814,7.5349,2.368,0.0845,4.9632,3.2239,2.0678,2.8239,2.6749,0.643,0.1627,0.026,1.5562,6.4818,8.17,3.8849,0.4571,3.5107,0.7375,6.0181,3.8964,0.0007,0.4551,0.7536,5.2041,7.062,4.4715,1.6036,1.5693,22.9287,0.0204,4.8092,0.0052,4.5902,2.3435,4.155,5.7334,3.2339,0.6369,3.2553,1.9472,1.6341,13.4567,1.2608,2.9028,0.1247,1.2356,0.2954,0.8127,0.8908,5.2033,3.7573,5.5999,3.1929,0.2978,2.5885,0.8461,5.5141,0.4708,3.0239,4.3507,4.7306,1.1326,0.3047,3.1631,5.3303,0.0009,2.4603,6.0278,1.7241,2.8812,1.0605,0.2843,2.3933,4.4578,4.585,5.2378,5.3915,2.6463,2.1805,1.7292,5.1731,2.832,12.0398,0.0047,0.6022,0.1898,0.5485,0.3308,3.5403,3.1163,5.1354,1.6733,5.8654,0.01,4.3229,1.6043,5.3571,3.2425,0.7139,1.9898,6.0715,1.9506,3.836,0.0038,4.2734,7.7878,1.7212,3.1221,1.8057,2.6709,1.7278,5.4042,3.7737,2.5297,0.6116,1.3851,4.5213,9.2337,7.4529,3.1204,0.7455,0.0115,1.3545,3.2242,0.283,1.9673,0.7945,2.8866,3.2615,2.392,6.1929,0.3154,1.4624,10.1675,10.0571,8.4359,4.9165,1.1107,6.8268,0.0535,2.3751,3.1752,6.2669,0.0201,4.8411,3.1728,0.1827,0.3831,1.9352,3.3034,4.0542,3.2483,11.4347,4.6691,1.3756,0.0006,1.0178,7.1747,5.9023,4.136,0.4591,6.342,3.5352,1.3422,10.8579,9.8776,2.5424,5.1823,1.7623,2.4023,1.5578,0.0799,2.9476,4.0055,6.5253,2.2128,3.9333,5.3925,1.6684,0.6159,2.1329,0.6902,3.9147,5.3915,0.8748,0.9541,2.2929,4.0969,5.4069,4.8394,3.6448,1.7074,5.0152,5.8643,3.7436,2.8371,3.7734,4.5425,1.951,3.8264,1.8433,5.5081,1.7171,1.3922,4.7311,5.8389,0.61,1.6506,1.3609,1.9377,4.0274,1.5861,2.0687,3.0446,5.8582,0.3815,4.7057,0.0286,0.0999,0.9008,4.0393,2.7716,2.7288,3.2788,0.3733,3.4062,1.1879,3.0213,0.1801,0.0005,0.4262,6.9275,0.0497,6.3615,2.7874,2.156,0.0139,0.0926,1.0566,0.7844]}
{"prompt":"Black mambas breed annually and mating occurs in the early spring , when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail . After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female","text":"Black mambas breed annually and mating occurs in the early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female closely and if the female is receptive he will lay his sperm directly on her vagina. The female then stores sperm in her reproductive tract for future breeding and a single mating can produce numerous eggs, the embryos of which can develop into multiple individuals.\nIn the wild male mambas grow from the size of baby squirrels to that of a dog at a growth rate of about 2 inches per year. Female mambas grow from a size similar to squirrels to that of a cat, at a rate of about 4 inches per year.\nMechanical Capture\nIn captivity the black mamba is one of the most popular reptiles and is often used for pet keepers and for scientific purposes. In captivity there are many sources of venomous snakes including the Viperidae family, the Russell's Scolos venom, the Viperess venom, and the Serpentidae family.\nVenom\nFrom a historical perspective it was believed to be a good source of antidotes for various diseases from smallpox, leprosy, and snake bite and it was even used to treat leprosy. A study conducted in 1979 found that the mean lethal dose (LD 50 ) was 3.3 mlg. Venom contains various biogenic amines with the predominant ones toxin and strychnine.\nIn the wild venom is produced in both the posterior and lateral cephalic regions and the cephalic venom sac is surrounded by a capsule that protects it from the gastrointestinal tract and stomach. Following a bite the poison enters the body through the mouth and throat, through the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses and then is distributed throughout the body. Venom causes paralysis and convulsions as well as local and systemic inflammation.\nParasites\nThe black mamba has a wide variety of parasitic organisms and has been observed to carry and transmit several pathogens. It is an obligate blood-feeder and therefore is a natural host for many blood-borne parasites. Parasites include the Giardia lamblidia, Plasmodium ( P. relictum, P. yoelii, P. malate, P. oocirrus ) and the Babesia (B. microti, B. koehnii, B. divergens, B. brucei ) in Africa ; Trypanosoma ( T. annulata, T. nigeriensis, T. brucei, T. vivax ) in West Africa ; Hepatozoon ( Hepatozoon hepatozoon, Hepatozoon lustris, Hepatozoon felis ) in Asia and Europe ; and the Strongyloides stercoralis ( S. stercoralis ) in America.","token_len":596,"entropy":[8.0124,7.4164,1.9653,10.5406,9.4799,3.189,8.1641,2.6943,1.5161,2.1473,3.5,1.4266,2.1603,2.7259,6.0295,0.5293,0.9234,0.0126,8.1136,2.3005,1.6038,4.3523,5.1671,0.6701,1.8058,2.7561,1.0112,4.5233,6.1182,1.3047,7.0545,0.2958,4.7808,1.9149,2.0545,7.4533,1.0081,1.2498,6.0202,1.1859,4.9234,2.2591,1.1062,1.2457,5.0866,2.4067,0.2644,4.759,4.0013,3.9151,4.8766,0.9187,0.9894,5.37,0.722,1.8699,2.6757,2.1259,6.9388,2.9869,0.7238,1.3258,5.6195,1.2517,2.5592,2.497,2.3017,2.3789,4.4228,4.8793,4.3741,3.385,4.2429,5.9392,3.3901,3.1075,4.4543,7.3411,1.9696,0.0644,1.3293,5.9996,0.0492,5.1134,4.0718,0.3841,1.2136,10.5543,1.8739,2.4065,4.0808,0.172,0.1782,0.0027,6.2079,3.3645,3.2101,4.9446,0.0416,7.1233,5.8939,0.3319,0.9473,6.9822,0.1528,1.2355,5.5968,4.9452,2.443,6.7678,0.3197,0.26,1.8872,2.5816,2.7209,0.6897,0.6782,0.269,4.9317,0.3103,0.0283,0.0037,4.7738,1.196,2.7375,3.1162,4.9769,0.0196,5.205,0.3525,1.2595,2.0294,0.0549,0.4425,2.2747,2.4213,5.9923,1.2198,1.3124,0.1209,0.6671,2.7249,0.3291,0.1094,0.0403,0.2086,1.8504,10.2045,0.7738,8.0371,1.2864,2.7939,2.782,2.1647,7.7853,0.1021,2.3848,1.9011,5.1341,0.0207,0.5362,1.1137,3.6017,5.7408,2.5252,1.9162,2.9846,1.8037,2.118,5.8088,8.3274,0.4495,1.6879,3.3614,6.6464,2.126,0.3229,2.6037,0.6678,3.979,0.4923,1.9089,6.7409,0.3863,7.293,1.7058,2.0151,3.9307,1.8693,8.1127,4.4481,4.1393,1.57,1.2766,8.8562,3.6445,7.7822,5.4901,8.1052,9.7924,3.6838,0.6415,5.4997,7.4983,9.7607,2.9929,0.4834,1.3403,0.2594,7.9928,1.2243,0.6023,0.4348,1.5111,8.7349,0.0899,4.7268,6.0509,3.085,6.7728,0.625,2.8744,3.6255,3.0368,2.8311,0.4603,1.2785,5.9942,2.9132,0.0263,9.3405,0.0162,1.7161,4.9637,0.8953,5.2699,5.2296,2.1725,2.3043,4.5273,0.1935,0.0006,0.138,1.1997,6.1473,2.1033,4.2168,3.2143,0.9964,4.8333,0.9326,1.6309,1.1752,4.7774,0.21,0.0027,1.1509,3.9958,4.4104,2.1524,1.4172,5.6414,2.131,0.2429,1.8446,9.4982,4.7503,0.2201,4.1434,5.8513,3.0727,0.2823,3.7108,3.6661,0.6299,2.6899,6.312,7.1116,2.8926,3.7949,5.1282,5.5082,6.9173,2.1539,7.6795,0.5764,4.578,2.5504,6.1954,5.4269,10.1194,2.3834,6.4696,1.1321,0.0116,0.006,0.8656,1.772,2.5222,1.4627,1.2988,4.6899,1.1469,3.8665,2.0223,4.9401,2.3286,9.9765,0.6468,4.9097,5.3204,0.9032,0.001,2.2271,2.4231,2.6823,2.6779,5.0155,0.0604,0.0019,0.2416,6.2606,8.4761,1.4573,5.538,0.0686,1.0741,7.5368,2.3343,4.4805,1.7535,0.1679,1.7827,8.4741,1.2986,1.4916,6.086,0.4995,7.4113,2.1765,4.0193,1.1951,4.7512,3.5,0.1831,3.4944,1.8267,0.3372,3.9796,0.7251,6.0032,2.4901,3.7395,0.2686,3.9904,0.644,1.0938,8.885,4.8198,0.2762,3.566,0.0188,1.0831,2.7337,4.0258,4.6865,1.9001,0.0543,0.4198,0.7873,3.8755,5.2329,3.1592,1.3949,4.6098,0.0107,0.0071,4.0088,0.8535,0.0401,8.7165,3.1822,0.6885,3.1192,0.8485,0.9786,7.3943,0.2906,1.4068,1.9952,1.8406,4.6523,0.0361,0.0116,2.5683,1.5494,3.4323,1.3611,0.0067,2.3249,3.4449,2.3162,4.1783,0.8709,4.3156,0.5937,3.7348,5.3793,2.8771,3.7165,4.3881,1.2829,3.1315,0.7088,3.9369,4.1637,0.0175,7.6503,1.3514,6.421,0.0762,1.0181,5.9298,2.7062,2.5695,3.8052,2.0565,0.3651,1.7305,7.9925,0.6934,0.2303,2.281,0.6936,4.1451,0.2376,2.8547,1.6214,7.1075,0.0103,0.2304,9.5821,0.574,11.3043,0.6244,6.4541,0.6904,0.1219,0.0036,5.9989,9.071,1.0118,6.8901,5.9212,3.7561,4.9006,2.2298,0.0518,13.6005,5.7339,3.7283,1.0059,0.8387,0.0203,6.2621,5.1551,2.1723,0.4347,0.0017,4.9129,6.8155,5.9607,5.4925,4.3328,0.1587,1.8003,8.7176,3.8808,0.6983,3.6432,4.9532,0.9686,7.6401,6.7019,1.279,2.0978,0.0371,5.4111,7.2794,3.4827,0.1957,0.5282,0.731,0.0022,10.0159,2.032,1.5071,1.71,0.52,0.0015,7.3693,1.6571,1.7379,3.1958,3.991,3.7496,9.6387,10.6782,0.968,1.0198,0.9226,2.1496,3.3674,0.3984,7.308,2.4027,0.9804,0.4302,0.4199,0.0009,5.1215,2.4726,7.4116,0.1491,0.578,0.2879,0.0006,6.3323,0.133,0.6705,1.0005,0.2474,0.0008,5.3351,2.867,2.2719,1.2096,0.5764,5.4415,0.2441,1.6027,6.7267,6.226,3.2577,2.314,2.0945,4.5719,0.4638,0.4228,0.0744,6.9267,0.7655,0.5143,0.0593,2.2522,1.1487,0.0223,0.089,0.0104,10.6931,4.5959,0.8106,0.197,0.0038,0.0229,0.0029,7.24,1.0973,1.5018,0.3623,2.7677,1.5478,4.1981,1.0949,1.2594,2.4288,12.4552,3.6473,3.3806,0.8371,6.7325,5.003,4.9671,0.1793,0.8912,4.0054,0.2052,3.528,0.3309,0.3291,0.0327,2.2014,0.3186,4.9684,0.6332]}
{"prompt":"The common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , North America , Fiji and several Caribbean islands . As a result , it","text":"The common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America, Fiji and several Caribbean islands. As a result, it is now the most widely distributed bird in Australia. Many birds from New Zealand were introduced to these countries to assist with their livestock. Many more are feral and invasive and are often treated as pests. However, this does not mean that they will no longer be able to carry the virus to Australia. It is therefore important to keep a watchful eye for changes in the composition of migratory bird communities in New Zealand, Fiji, Australia and other countries as a result of the virus or introduction of it by feral birds, and to monitor their migration patterns to New Zealand.\nIn many parts of the world the number of birds that die from avian influenza, as well as the number of those that get infected is very low. Birds usually die by becoming too weak to fly. When infected the birds become so weak that they are unable to fly or stand up. Infected areas often see a considerable reduction in birds. A decrease in the population is often followed by the migration of birds to other parts of their country. This is a precautionary measure to prevent further spread of disease.\nOften it is difficult to identify an outbreak of avian influenza. The disease can come a long period between the time that an outbreak is first noticed and the time that it is recognised. This does not mean that the outbreak is finished in that area and can be re-introduced elsewhere. Sometimes it takes a little longer for the virus to be introduced and cause an outbreak in its original area. On one occasion an outbreak of avian influenza occurred in a local area that was isolated from other areas by mountains. It took many years and the death of many birds before the virus was brought into another area by the birds arriving from the local infected area. On another occasion, the arrival of migratory birds that were infected in North America brought about a local avian influenza outbreak in Japan. This took longer than the outbreak in North America. In order to determine the spread and distribution of the disease, the number of birds that die in an outbreak is counted. When a number of thousands of birds die within a month it is likely that there is an outbreak. In some countries, such as Australia and North America, the deaths are recorded on a daily basis. This helps to alert the public to any deaths. In some countries, such as Japan, this is not done. In Japan, the number of birds that are seen dying is recorded. The number that die is often very small compared with the number of birds that die in the previous year from other causes. It can take many years for a large number of birds to die in what may be a lowly bird like a swainson\u2019s thrush. However, when many dead birds are seen, it may start to be noticed, even in remote areas.","token_len":597,"entropy":[7.7477,10.6453,6.8661,3.4067,1.8225,5.7162,1.3301,8.1112,3.6689,6.6551,5.1672,1.1537,1.1183,5.0741,0.4798,1.8616,2.429,0.6242,2.961,0.7426,0.5237,5.6282,0.2371,0.6902,7.5755,1.1748,4.9841,4.4253,0.7198,0.38,4.7868,1.5138,2.1253,0.5992,1.5415,1.1252,1.5651,2.7274,1.5881,1.9543,2.1052,3.7597,0.9122,3.534,0.8584,5.5355,3.4328,3.9371,2.233,0.018,5.7238,1.8901,0.5972,6.1146,3.0335,2.8603,4.4217,1.5796,2.2826,9.1298,3.0335,3.9357,3.6247,2.1644,10.0754,1.532,7.0225,2.6479,1.6385,3.6102,5.4767,1.2745,1.0867,0.8322,4.4575,0.0544,4.056,2.8546,0.0379,0.4756,0.4167,1.9334,2.4385,3.4355,0.0039,0.4527,4.5699,0.0057,4.4956,1.9632,3.3357,2.8619,2.8968,0.5376,3.28,0.6374,3.6464,0.7875,0.5457,2.6259,2.6644,3.6764,0.3099,0.0061,3.1618,6.2764,0.3795,0.897,6.1343,0.2452,6.7483,0.0042,2.6536,4.6782,2.0323,1.36,0.0056,1.9978,7.2131,1.0533,2.0497,0.5309,1.3016,1.808,3.6789,3.717,0.9075,0.0355,1.2591,3.6628,5.7913,6.1057,1.022,3.3822,6.3146,2.6595,1.1125,3.6161,2.3665,1.277,2.3788,2.6561,3.1797,0.5697,2.2375,5.996,0.0018,1.1098,0.6722,11.2139,4.186,2.6939,0.0036,0.5161,0.1924,3.3906,3.8884,0.049,2.7809,2.0302,6.2957,0.9145,4.1159,0.0083,0.7037,3.2658,2.5274,0.2443,0.0029,1.2256,1.1314,0.1812,4.8338,0.8056,4.6096,1.4399,3.9098,3.0769,1.3583,0.4258,5.6521,6.2296,1.5377,3.7089,4.4066,5.0141,3.72,0.5548,2.6839,2.2918,4.8433,4.9204,4.2251,1.3742,2.684,3.6837,0.3406,0.3189,0.3181,2.5895,0.4907,0.0071,0.6795,2.8398,5.3245,0.4955,0.7564,5.6513,0.5525,7.5023,3.1145,5.9236,2.319,6.8398,2.7405,0.0834,3.7732,2.8943,3.6876,5.2812,0.1057,1.1547,4.0497,2.8837,2.9243,3.2776,0.0368,2.951,5.1813,0.2367,2.0914,1.0443,1.7297,1.236,0.0039,5.0953,3.8281,0.8689,2.5775,1.2077,2.7382,8.2904,0.3505,0.2296,1.6432,1.7113,2.9309,2.2758,0.1519,3.606,0.8286,0.8845,7.2908,3.8873,0.1092,2.9075,0.2789,2.5603,3.6278,3.8152,0.6653,1.0532,0.0019,0.0604,2.2685,2.2076,3.479,1.6039,5.4755,8.6891,1.556,10.1178,6.3713,1.4174,1.9687,2.9321,2.0432,1.1742,1.4055,2.2068,2.4801,0.1948,0.902,0.9017,1.135,1.5398,0.611,4.8164,0.6572,2.7562,5.1679,0.1193,0.2707,0.0998,1.6031,2.6054,0.739,7.184,3.9066,5.3013,4.424,2.9594,3.9447,0.5515,4.6266,0.1163,2.5269,0.0034,4.2696,0.2672,5.2171,1.737,3.5889,1.9359,4.1255,1.1443,1.209,1.0506,1.232,0.04,1.7585,4.5272,3.4042,6.6427,2.7399,0.4762,1.7551,5.4932,2.972,2.9214,0.3878,5.9748,5.6191,0.2656,3.0823,0.2147,1.4938,0.4422,0.004,0.0432,2.2298,0.299,2.0135,4.3905,2.1941,3.6844,0.8729,4.8408,0.695,2.2112,1.1085,4.0278,11.5656,1.3045,2.9438,3.8528,3.1585,0.4172,3.5655,2.9232,7.2207,2.0713,1.77,0.6493,3.0507,0.8863,1.286,0.6482,5.5551,2.7051,5.8705,0.8554,3.6786,2.1142,3.9774,7.1969,0.9412,1.6985,4.5842,10.0079,0.3195,0.1243,5.928,2.8514,0.0092,1.5571,1.8139,6.2437,0.0638,6.4688,0.0094,0.1368,4.5341,1.5352,3.1097,2.4594,6.6319,0.3321,4.4996,3.8681,0.7598,4.6608,3.6552,0.0052,0.316,0.8429,1.0609,5.8527,0.4367,2.1967,6.39,3.7273,1.2108,1.8393,2.1583,1.4174,1.9149,0.0209,1.4757,2.9885,4.6528,0.0813,3.6124,0.8593,4.0751,4.1868,5.5748,0.0307,1.2062,1.9098,0.9431,1.7116,3.3296,0.1539,0.7109,0.8172,1.9044,2.3986,2.9308,0.3045,1.4112,5.5037,1.565,4.3937,2.1525,2.9988,0.2487,8.0203,0.2666,0.224,1.0948,4.5871,0.458,3.8158,3.6813,0.2499,4.5846,0.1491,2.3587,1.8768,1.7877,0.5541,1.1388,2.8222,2.4551,2.2281,1.7191,2.8987,0.0052,1.4247,1.5249,4.8521,0.0407,0.1345,1.4505,5.3479,1.2107,3.5964,3.2442,1.2092,3.0042,0.0583,0.5573,2.2756,4.5748,0.5686,7.6832,1.4105,0.4663,0.8841,3.0918,7.0572,1.9082,2.3931,1.5121,1.1276,0.7531,1.4858,0.0009,3.138,0.2654,3.8836,1.3189,1.552,3.483,0.9065,1.9122,4.0573,0.5813,1.4588,1.3826,0.1093,0.7522,0.4143,2.5087,5.5563,1.4595,1.4895,1.4095,3.763,2.2844,1.0427,4.0633,1.1055,1.2384,3.2967,3.3594,0.7644,3.4879,1.4441,0.5597,0.338,0.8744,0.8157,0.2823,2.259,1.0462,1.3509,3.8062,1.0146,6.7587,2.0634,1.4484,0.3593,2.8487,2.8294,2.3077,2.149,0.2834,0.7028,2.1589,3.6389,0.7351,0.0208,0.2192,0.1805,0.8048,1.4432,6.8145,3.7405,0.3098,1.5013,13.8874,4.7378,4.8247,0.8378,6.3396,12.7282,9.0054,13.3262,6.9457,5.0371,9.6286,0.5719,0.9265,3.3562,0.0825,3.3394,4.7311,7.2376,0.0869,0.4835,0.5907,1.619,1.4418,3.3129,6.7726,0.2922,3.0365,1.9457,4.0982,3.5524,2.5975,4.541,0.3309,0.8894]}

{"prompt":"Travel between Haifa and the center of the country is possible by road with Highway 2 , the main highway along the coastal plain , beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa . Furthermore","text":"Travel between Haifa and the center of the country is possible by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, you can travel via the Route 2, starting at Rishon Letzion.\nHaifa is also very accessible by the Airport of Ben Gurion International, located 19 kilometers away, with flights from Europe each week. Direct flights also operate from Tel Aviv airport and a daily flight also operates from Herzliya.\nThe city of Haifa has a very nice beach, the main part of which is the Marina on both the north and south sides. The south side is mainly a sandy beach, but on the north side there is a mix of sand and pebbles. This means that there are no bathing areas on the north side, but on the south side the water is cool and ideal for a swim. The sand on both sides is white and very fine. The beach on the south side is also the one most visited by tourists.\nAlso on Haifa's beaches are many cafes, bars and restaurants located right on the sand where the tourists and local people gather.\nIn addition to the beautiful beaches, Haifa has very interesting archaeological sites, both on land and onboard and, above all, on the Mediterranean Sea. The remains of the city's Roman and Ottoman history are many and diverse. Many historical sites are also present around the city of Haifa, with sites such as Giv'at Hamah, Kikar Ha'Ovda, Rishon Letzion and much more. In addition to the archaeological sites in Haifa, around you will also find nature preserves with many plants and trees.\nAnother important thing in the city of Haifa is that here you will find many Jewish and Christian sites, as well as some Islamic ruins of the Byzantine era. Among these you will find the sites that served as strongholds for the different Jewish communities that lived here for centuries.\nOther attractions are the Mosque of Joseph, the Basilica Church, the synagogue and the Church of St. Mary.\nThe city of Haifa is located at the very end of the coastal plain, in a beautiful area that was previously sand dunes, but were later transformed and turned into a series of gardens, parks and golf courses. This was a very important and lucrative work for the government, especially during the heyday of high national productivity and tourist arrivals. As a result, Haifa now has a very beautiful beach, very well equipped with amenities and services, and with excellent facilities, mainly theaters, hotels and restaurants.

F. K. Fisher, writing in The New York Times, stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised `` every aspect of their lives.. as much as possible in ways which made their existence... possible.`` He wrote that : `` the primary object was the reproduction of the women... all activities were subordinated to that... in the 19th century almost all of society was shaped according to women's rights and interests, the main exception being education, in which men's rights to control women's lives became more important than women's own rights.'' It was the period of rapid expansion of women's rights, including women's suffrage and political rights, with several hundred feminist demonstrations, with some 1 7 0 fatalities, in 1905 and 1907. Feminists also demanded public education for girls, although it remains largely a male institution. It was this movement, in the USA and elsewhere, which led to the inclusion of feminist and feminist themes in some of the most prominent nineteenth century literature.\nBy the end of the Twentieth Century, women's rights were taken for granted within both politics and religion. In the USA, women were able to vote in every political elections, and the majority of the population (70 % on average) considers women equal partners of men in society and to have equal rights to men in private and public life. (In the past half century the proportion of women who have attended high schools has risen from 15 % to 30 %)[clarification needed] The last two states to deny women voting rights were New Hampshire and Wyoming, both within the last century. Feminism has also entered into the religion of Christianity. In many denominations women can now occupy all or many of the priesthood positions.\nWhile it may be argued that the 20th-century era represents a major expansion of female rights internationally and in the USA, particularly within women's liberation and feminist movements, social, cultural, and legal challenges to equality of women and men persist globally.\nWomen have increasingly come to represent the majority of the labour force, with some countries over half of the adult workforce being female. A strong feminist movement continues to challenge the traditional norms of the past.\nIn the West, attitudes towards feminism have changed in recent decades, to some extent as a result of campaigns within the media and the establishment. In 1990, a landmark poll was conducted in Britain, looking at gender attitudes amongst both the general population and members of the Labour Party (which led with 32.9 % of votes, followed by the Liberal Democrats (17.9 %) and the Conservatives ( 16.0 %)). The poll also asked, for the first time, if voters would be supportive of policies which would restrict the employment or academic opportunities of women. One in four (24.7 %) said they would be supportive of a government banning women from the Civil Service, and 15.6 % said they supported the right of the government to force women into early retirement.","token_len":598,"entropy":[2.7075,5.7023,1.8141,4.9762,2.0308,8.0826,0.9111,8.9234,0.5034,1.8107,2.1539,0.426,0.1554,0.8185,4.9922,0.7626,8.87,0.1358,4.0083,2.9844,4.2835,1.3442,4.2879,0.0172,0.3368,12.5116,11.3133,12.3944,5.8749,0.0333,1.0385,0.4185,9.9143,5.3854,4.3214,0.49,1.3937,2.1283,4.8089,1.9746,3.3068,2.5716,5.8292,5.7263,3.1583,2.1878,5.6377,4.0705,3.1744,0.8478,10.8606,1.7901,3.8158,6.3973,4.5004,3.3745,2.1536,3.2688,0.1031,1.2547,3.9692,4.7328,6.0058,6.4788,2.767,5.3531,0.0178,0.1699,2.8774,5.9015,4.124,1.867,6.7693,0.012,0.133,6.5083,0.8348,2.1376,2.9827,0.9953,6.1536,5.2655,0.0167,4.7299,0.1756,6.5319,2.0921,3.2848,2.0937,4.1241,4.565,5.3075,0.0626,3.7287,1.6368,3.4548,0.4692,3.0661,3.3748,3.1819,5.7443,4.0101,2.2609,1.3293,1.974,3.847,2.9325,1.4314,0.6154,0.9582,0.0171,3.539,2.6396,3.0779,4.2844,0.9734,2.6235,6.2648,0.721,5.6745,3.8576,0.8096,1.7155,0.0545,0.9507,2.5586,5.1371,3.125,0.0355,1.1641,0.0003,1.8338,5.5057,3.0681,0.3275,7.3122,7.7404,3.4653,7.6566,7.1264,2.1411,5.2228,4.284,4.5658,9.3418,7.1509,10.279,1.5006,2.2966,6.3545,1.7237,3.1277,0.7999,5.4467,1.0268,2.9407,5.1233,6.6094,1.9946,2.223,3.1803,1.1639,5.6886,2.973,6.4166,3.6835,2.2381,3.4137,4.467,0.4425,3.8088,0.6045,3.4949,3.9822,2.223,3.2497,1.8722,6.6831,1.9126,1.8134,0.1401,1.3538,2.0627,0.2868,0.5109,7.7582,0.1322,5.2914,3.6143,3.1605,7.0434,0.3434,5.7206,1.2602,0.2545,1.7005,3.4196,6.6905,0.4717,3.2255,0.8375,4.0884,9.682,1.1295,2.2662,0.0031,0.1519,6.6311,0.0016,0.0046,0.3706,0.4991,2.7947,0.9294,1.2715,1.5357,5.9011,2.037,0.0094,5.6957,4.9631,5.3826,0.0297,3.0393,0.5646,2.2364,1.4127,3.1716,0.437,2.5262,1.4124,4.7255,0.0545,2.1297,2.3583,4.2887,3.146,5.6969,1.2981,1.5348,3.0062,4.2813,0.1935,2.4041,2.104,4.5332,4.0995,4.8747,7.1435,1.6878,0.1512,10.353,3.5496,5.175,5.125,1.867,0.7511,2.0449,3.5938,3.176,4.0245,2.3511,2.1843,0.5067,2.4406,5.3762,1.7126,4.3713,3.722,0.5989,0.3114,0.1721,4.585,2.973,1.6774,5.6859,4.747,0.2308,3.3046,2.7231,0.1151,0.4864,2.8104,1.9924,5.4546,4.7242,2.1724,0.9978,2.1616,1.6587,3.4911,0.3371,0.4891,3.1882,0.0319,10.5767,10.4768,1.0979,0.2125,0.6643,0.8611,2.5925,5.9804,3.1917,6.7688,1.3234,6.9884,0.7071,4.3568,0.21,1.5575,2.5247,2.8608,0.3408,4.9792,1.479,2.4249,6.7507,0.6185,2.2334,2.2882,0.5349,6.8249,0.8812,3.2779,2.5951,5.8361,1.6552,1.6204,8.1349,1.6661,4.2076,1.5471,1.8974,4.3061,4.6395,2.9521,4.5156,3.4993,8.6649,4.873,3.4558,4.1271,1.5027,0.3239,3.8895,2.963,1.5765,2.895,5.2697,3.4493,2.5384,1.1219,3.1053,0.0745,1.5409,6.1232,0.0644,3.5658,0.0541,5.2514,5.3292,0.788,4.0888,5.6811,0.2524,4.1471,1.4135,7.0768,3.2484,1.6098,1.2464,0.729,0.2235,6.3246,3.9183,4.2762,0.112,3.8025,3.6069,3.1677,0.4948,0.33,7.8507,4.0631,1.9677,0.8758,0.5378,3.6494,4.6972,1.4869,5.4813,2.8025,2.7608,2.7974,2.2327,4.5595,7.1205,0.5717,2.9917,3.7397,3.5846,5.3623,3.6885,0.6283,4.7825,1.6574,1.6939,0.4929,1.3917,8.2731,0.1174,1.9795,2.5717,4.0311,6.5685,6.9569,2.7809,0.6941,1.283,4.9704,3.2608,4.1111,3.0795,0.5002,4.5056,5.1102,4.3231,1.1691,5.0442,0.5269,3.6151,1.2338,4.2877,5.6689,0.4926,2.5804,4.6862,1.9144,2.0825,2.6619,1.3238,5.3774,0.2931,6.0999,1.1128,3.3103,1.0214,1.2956,2.8487,2.1189,0.8108,1.4758,5.3474,3.4632,0.337,3.9186,0.7174,0.2005,0.0045,9.2183,5.7957,0.9554,5.0397,1.1001,2.4142,6.952,2.0904,2.0957,5.71,0.8014,2.7363,6.0613,5.2173,3.9619,0.5523,1.549,3.0416,1.6719,6.4947,0.191,4.7314,1.1539,5.3054,5.3183,3.7619,1.5865,2.0058,0.2221,5.0208,0.0088,0.7103,5.5156,0.2508,3.0525,4.4781,5.5497,4.0696,5.5921,3.2109,2.2937,0.2638,0.7747,4.3569,2.1849,3.1861,0.0909,1.1219,2.1264,0.2222,1.8983,3.6092,0.1258,1.9738,0.1423,1.5473,0.4188,0.7407,1.0318,0.0498,11.735,0.0537,2.8654,0.0255,0.6476,1.4227,1.6838,3.405,3.5593,3.6642,3.0828,0.2964,0.0289,0.0003,0.359,4.1588,6.3163,3.128,2.9006,5.8222,0.1711,5.0152,2.6236,1.4088,4.9191,1.8136,5.1481,4.0929,8.6838,2.2256,0.1997,0.1897,1.3373,4.8374,2.8443,1.655,2.0657,2.4626,0.5983,2.1514,0.3097,0.0787,2.2951,0.7003,0.3385,1.4783,1.5124,0.3995,3.2878,3.6463,5.6083,1.7991,0.2823,2.7309,10.7612,0.0298,1.3591,1.8297,4.7301,0.3804,2.1786,0.1476,0.7294,0.1422,4.8756,2.6642,3.0073,0.67,3.0588,3.2624,0.0522,4.4574,0.9597,1.6876,7.5113,0.4714,0.7529]}
{"prompt":"During late July , an upper @ - @ level low , with a non @ - @ tropical cold core , formed near Cape Hatteras , North Carolina and tracked southward . Gradually ,","text":"During late July, an upper @ - @ level low, with a non @ - @ tropical cold core, formed near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and tracked southward. Gradually, the depression expanded as it intensified. It produced heavy rain in New England and New York. During August, the high levels to the southeast of the low weakened, and the depression continued to track along the southern edge of the mid - @ upper tropospheric high. The high subsequently tracked northward and the depression dissipated. No further storms occurred over North Am erica during July.\nThe upper @ @ and mid - @ upper tropospheric highs were strong during late July and August, with the upper low at the center of the high. The mid @ upper tropospheric low was weaker that low. The low reached the mid - @ upper troposphere at altitudes of about 5 -8 km on 2 August and remained in this region of the stratosphere until early September. The weak, non - tropical lower tropospheric tropical cyclone located near the upper low was active with a central pressure of 966 mb, pressure tilt @ - @ zonal wind of 16 m s, wind velocity of 6 m s, wind @ - @ angle of 8, temperature differences of 1 K and relative humidity differences of 15. The weak and rapidly rotating upper low at about the same height and latitude as the tropical cyclone, did not produce wind or heavy precipitation over the continental United States or northeastern Mexico.\nConclusions\nThe model simulation for 5 August 1989, that included a mid - @ upper tropospheric low, was similar to the model simulation for 6 August 1986, but the magnitude of the rain rate was much smaller. The model simulation for 6 August 1986, that included an upper @ - @ level low, produced more precipitation and more rainfall.\nThe upper @ - @ and lower tropospheric low had similar effects on mid - @ upper tropospheric temperatures.\nThe upper @ - @ and mid - @ upper tropospheric low had a similar effect on stratospheric winds and temperatures.\nThe lower tropospheric tropical cyclone had a similar effect on mid -

Previously, the Spanish army was running the AMX M60 Patton tank, which suffered from serious shortcomings. The French tanks were a bit worse as well and the Spanish were very happy to have the option from France.\nThe French tanks were based on the AMX M60 Patton tanks, which suffered from serious shortcomings, both maneuver and armor. The French Leopards were better than what Spain had but still not good enough. The Spanish are happy to have the option from France but the French will not take a risk with an unknown, new tank. They are happy with what they have and with no other serious options.\nAs for the French M88 Patton - based tanks it doesn't seems they will become deployed anytime soon. The British have already ordered and expected, as I explained, to get their first Leopard tanks in 2011, the rest in 2012 - 2013. The Spanish ordered 6 M88A1s based on the Spanish Leopard M0 model, with the second batch of 6 expected sometime in 2014. At the last Leopard order, the UK agreed to pay the Spanish around \u20ac60 million for M88A1s and with the French Leopards this could soon be close to \u20ac150 million a tank. As I've said, it seems France will not take the risk to supply a new tank and the British have not decided on their own on who, if anyone, would supply them with these tanks.\nAs for the French AMX 13, the Spanish could probably do with some M13A3s, but these would be another \u20ac100-400 million - the UK already ordered them, the Americans could supply them as well, but it is not a priority for them - they may start asking for them in the future anyway.\nThe Spanish M45s are outdated as well, these have a serious problem with the fire control unit, and the Spanish are not planning on replacing them, so again I would not expect it to happen any time soon. The Spanish army is using their Leopard 2 and the M60 Patton as well.\nFrom a purely operational point, these vehicles seem great. I have not seen any, or in a real live event of what I do with the M16, but when I saw them at the US Army's European weapons facility at Altenburg, Germany, the way they were equipped, it was easy to see how well these work in practice in real life with all of the German infantry units there, on different exercises, where tanks are always a vital factor. The Spanish could certainly use these vehicles as well, in the future as I already mentioned and for many other reasons.\nSo yes, these vehicles are great and can definitely be the basis of a good combat strength, with the correct vehicles and in the right places, in a suitable place.","token_len":598,"entropy":[9.3248,5.4322,8.234,3.2715,6.8347,3.9561,4.8158,2.4402,2.7825,8.396,1.04,12.7223,8.1919,9.052,5.3488,5.116,1.9245,1.8631,5.2912,0.6357,9.6432,4.8531,0.269,3.9661,1.881,4.339,6.9192,1.8272,3.0693,4.1969,1.1018,8.3005,0.6947,0.9905,5.7307,2.6527,2.8366,5.865,2.537,3.8017,0.0398,5.7953,0.798,0.7348,1.6139,1.9123,2.0554,6.4769,1.1428,6.0448,2.7983,1.5764,1.6123,4.0586,4.7001,1.6757,4.3426,2.8765,4.0145,3.8098,0.3601,3.6077,1.9106,4.191,2.5706,4.8053,4.479,0.9259,2.3226,1.5886,6.5132,7.1318,4.5535,1.2591,1.6168,3.7795,2.2305,1.981,1.0154,5.0101,0.4986,0.6124,3.5932,0.2058,1.4176,0.6844,0.2838,2.5452,1.2944,1.5271,3.7916,0.2311,1.432,0.6794,2.5773,5.2346,8.4394,6.4545,4.3678,0.7742,1.0388,1.0139,9.1159,2.4901,0.2785,1.0207,3.5554,2.2461,5.8828,6.5017,0.8734,4.5205,3.4475,3.5151,3.7414,0.2002,1.473,1.0399,3.5749,5.2027,5.494,0.4582,0.427,0.4315,0.3799,0.2776,0.2154,2.8206,2.6105,0.8032,3.9922,1.2349,3.9452,3.3759,2.6503,2.4563,4.3522,7.799,5.0145,3.592,1.2812,0.6871,4.3678,1.9363,2.8242,2.2931,3.6104,1.1876,0.496,1.9211,4.5697,5.764,3.431,8.2826,5.3256,0.772,0.767,4.3825,1.4687,0.5335,2.7697,4.034,7.2979,1.4465,7.0547,6.6046,7.4464,5.3059,5.1481,0.004,9.4141,4.2596,1.9182,5.851,8.6228,4.6479,0.0124,0.6242,1.6959,5.6011,2.1974,2.6092,4.3175,5.4771,7.1827,5.9984,3.9601,4.3348,4.566,2.7806,2.653,4.1731,3.1111,3.2338,2.9563,3.5789,1.8837,4.7101,1.9678,3.1027,5.6211,2.3,1.4356,5.6086,4.1581,0.44,1.7573,4.8219,7.267,6.2089,4.595,1.3107,6.303,0.6029,2.6094,6.0061,0.1517,0.7231,5.7421,1.3025,4.8753,6.4736,6.7039,1.4549,3.2807,1.3718,4.8203,3.6349,1.69,3.282,6.2185,4.3743,0.5666,1.3387,0.3548,5.2237,1.1566,5.9859,9.0929,7.2678,1.2558,1.1752,4.5399,5.9548,0.2557,3.8954,2.4269,4.0117,5.0318,2.4212,3.8956,0.9576,1.4307,5.675,0.7343,2.1391,0.0909,0.5785,2.2346,5.3619,1.251,3.1434,7.2386,0.0372,0.0213,6.0852,3.8818,5.355,0.869,5.5605,0.2432,0.7658,3.8798,0.026,5.1644,2.5172,0.5679,4.4248,2.6398,4.4437,1.2121,1.2545,2.7955,3.0813,4.7759,1.4053,1.7638,1.9227,2.4141,0.2656,4.9087,5.3859,2.6215,1.9606,1.2588,3.6866,2.1666,2.4571,2.769,2.7785,3.8175,1.6806,3.5075,1.7446,5.9405,4.6613,5.8917,1.3994,1.1826,0.1268,4.064,2.8763,1.264,2.3992,3.8434,0.7357,0.2725,0.7987,3.2849,0.4447,0.3172,1.967,5.4507,0.073,9.807,2.2993,1.6008,3.4312,6.3489,4.0812,3.7761,1.2587,3.4001,3.2964,5.406,3.3846,2.6067,1.3339,1.6359,1.4661,5.0084,2.667,0.9985,6.5809,6.8911,2.0804,3.1706,5.3177,0.2208,5.9157,3.7376,3.3138,4.8141,3.443,2.8961,2.2026,2.0041,5.5491,4.386,3.0895,0.6478,3.3578,0.2672,1.2906,2.237,2.904,1.7957,1.7084,3.3763,4.603,1.4585,0.7448,4.2642,1.5793,4.3332,4.9211,6.2275,0.4628,2.2028,1.8412,1.0126,0.8235,6.5394,0.2984,0.9033,1.5316,3.1142,3.899,5.3766,5.0336,1.5615,8.2692,3.8368,0.841,1.234,6.2791,2.7831,2.5358,5.4604,1.7715,1.1204,2.2146,6.8189,0.9952,5.4937,1.7038,2.7764,1.6953,5.0751,2.0895,1.8582,5.2763,0.8002,2.268,0.4191,2.5857,1.9771,7.199,3.91,2.5774,1.2277,2.0131,4.6516,0.5723,2.0397,3.648,0.0115,0.0078,0.2304,1.8032,3.5712,4.6527,1.6269,4.4679,2.9835,2.0447,0.7897,3.8869,3.1853,2.8884,2.3684,0.2317,3.1428,2.3968,1.8733,1.2798,6.0916,2.2386,4.1059,3.0162,0.8361,6.34,3.9689,5.0427,4.5487,6.7943,1.6377,2.6075,2.77,2.4977,0.7292,1.0859,7.0903,3.1876,5.7192,3.7985,3.9042,7.0317,3.9648,3.6774,5.9289,2.869,5.2293,4.8572,3.3287,3.1711,4.8793,1.8884,1.6326,4.9997,0.8679,3.1741,1.6037,2.9034,1.3865,4.7095,1.415,2.6139,6.3477,7.3733,5.2483,3.1242,6.6779,5.8054,2.3365,1.1203,1.836,0.6266,3.4293,6.2284,0.6234,2.3755,5.2066,2.0991,2.7536,1.0377,5.1745,0.1074,0.8416,1.4402,2.9789,3.0398,5.8861,3.5034,2.1444,5.3284,1.7322,0.484,5.6069,4.0151,2.185,0.352,5.5377,3.7339,2.7776,4.7077,2.1777,6.0133,5.2296,6.7477,1.6327,5.0532,5.7031,1.4905,5.1134,4.6969,7.2103,3.2142,0.6597,2.1847,3.818,4.7827,3.6445,1.7181,1.6946,1.9533,2.7972,0.9463,0.8481,4.5004,2.1786,2.8173,2.9684,5.0624,5.1912,1.2061,3.8103,4.8794,4.6992,2.1276,0.8326,0.6425,0.6337,3.9493,5.5888,0.2011,2.3492,1.6309,0.8176,2.2149,2.3218,4.671,5.5175,0.7991,4.8002,4.1108,0.8549,0.9795,3.7551,4.1986,10.1889,1.9533,4.0176,1.9011,7.1119,4.3097,1.5034,5.6477,1.2266,0.4219,3.689,1.6962,3.105,2.1059,6.607,2.1371,1.1372]}

I can say without hesitation that ` ` Ernest the Second `'is the finest play that the English-speaking world has produced in many years.` ` I was thrilled to see the premiere of ` ` Ernest the Second `'at the National, as I knew the story would be true to life. ` ` Ernest is a delightful, honest, funny play that touches on the most important elements of American life.\nThe novel also tells the story of a young artist's passionate but unsuccessful love affair with Helen Dowling, a woman twice his age.\nIt follows the story of their lives and the story of their relationship from his first meeting to her death.\nA young artist is taken with a single gesture - a gesture of kindness - by a woman whose life is marked by tragedy.\nThis is the story of the encounter between Ernest Gaines and Helen Dowling ; a man and a woman on the brink of marriage, with both of them seeking a second chance at happiness.\nThe novel begins with a scene in New York City in the late 1800s.\nErnest Gaines is on the bus, returning to his hotel in a section of Brooklyn known to residents as Eastchester.\nOne of the passengers, a little girl who calls him \u201c Mr. Gaines \u201d, stops next to him, takes a sheet of paper from his bag, and writes the following name, signed Helen Dowling :\nMiss Dowling?\nI am Ernest Gaines, and I like you.\nIs that all?\u201d\n\u201c Yes, Mr. Gaines, \u201d Miss Dowling says. \u201c I really am Miss Dowling.\nI have made up my mind to be Miss Dowling ; it will work. \u201d\nAnd so it did.\nMiss Dowling became Ernest's second wife, and they enjoyed the fruits of their union for eleven years.\nErnest Gaines was born in Massachusetts in 1848, and his father died when he was a few months old.\nErnest joined the army in 1861, and served during the American Civil War.\nHe was admitted to the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania at the age of twenty-two, and became a partner with the famous ophthalmologist, Edward Levi.\nHe later became a lecturer
