In addition to captains and passengers, ships also contained substantial numbers of slaves, some of whom later managed to break free and join their former captains, sometimes taking more than one title.","token_len":155,"entropy":[8.1202,7.6402,0.4792,7.6635,8.5696,9.5621,5.5071,7.4346,1.343,1.5053,2.6108,1.7043,4.5059,1.3406,2.3222,2.6321,2.6082,1.6303,5.3586,0.0619,1.4949,8.5207,2.2529,8.3339,2.5605,8.1874,0.2612,0.0644,2.8968,3.1992,6.7562,9.0529,5.9838,1.2806,5.587,2.0802,0.1921,3.5132,0.4566,2.2376,5.7077,1.2272,3.0271,3.2453,2.6286,3.6896,4.3322,0.0813,4.3376,11.5222,0.007,2.4819,1.5645,7.7953,0.9258,0.601,6.1264,0.0116,3.9546,5.9872,3.6594,5.5079,2.6337,5.5194,0.0973,2.5212,5.0856,7.5096,9.0737,0.0009,1.7912,4.886,3.7755,4.9473,0.689,5.2768,0.8162,6.6549,0.3021,2.4859,5.064,1.4586,4.9392,4.1116,0.2464,5.4178,3.5621,4.0797,8.2124,2.179,5.1422,2.1915,8.6436,0.0004,8.3981,1.0613,0.8849,10.9723,3.1865,1.4117,1.842,6.0283,1.8846,9.2383,1.186,4.2868,7.6623,0.3594,1.5193,4.4542,1.8677,5.1344,4.7009,0.0034,4.7899,2.7312,0.7538,0.9419,2.5568,2.9672,0.7625,5.1807,2.5736,4.5992,0.2704,5.8136,2.5707,4.1628,7.5238,2.2901,0.0075,3.8796,1.4448,3.9471,0.4142,0.1719,6.4505,5.713,0.0603,5.7073,0.357,1.6875,2.5002,2.7591,4.8869,3.7905,3.5764,4.4266,4.997,5.1258,0.525,1.6589,7.4178,0.8328]}

But by this time, the Quakers and their rivals had established a common cultural identity, a new English language and language arts schools, and a social framework for the organization of Quakerism. Quakers often took advantage of the English political power over the Dutch, such as the support they received from the Puritan-led English Parliament. Quakers and other religious groups, such as Methodists, were able to make a great deal of progress in the 17th century despite the English control of the colonies.","token_len":156,"entropy":[2.5591,8.4687,5.6815,8.9413,0.689,0.2027,0.8968,5.1251,9.7255,0.0201,4.8426,2.9107,4.5324,0.2496,4.3107,8.4952,0.1089,5.1894,7.7015,0.0015,4.7798,2.8358,2.5225,6.6907,2.1473,1.3584,4.8917,1.4534,6.3293,0.5921,1.7766,4.4555,11.4178,0.0145,0.0033,0.0606,8.8052,5.4735,0.7233,6.0815,1.2028,8.4041,1.5404,4.1401,4.2035,2.2224,3.5245,0.8336,2.2575,3.1591,1.6473,4.8318,0.3576,3.6621,3.5585,4.9103,0.1201,0.6443,1.4056,1.7267,0.3577,4.1424,1.448,6.6576,0.7856,3.9372,0.9835,5.2041,5.1575,1.4444,1.3895,3.1824,4.8544,6.7534,1.2214,1.8548,4.5362,6.8487,7.583,1.1008,0.8759,0.9713,5.1724,6.561,1.3856,2.0627,6.2276,0.2924,2.9827,0.9765,3.8892,0.6062,3.8254,0.5619,5.188,4.157,3.7622,0.0026,0.9755,4.4327,7.2333,4.1716,6.2562,1.1319,6.8272,1.3156,6.3795,0.0576,1.7153,5.8884,2.0955,0.7076,0.3689,1.0907,4.5842,2.3192,3.0749,3.4371,4.4407,3.0504,1.2116,3.3748,0.3474,3.8959,1.7799,3.4294,1.3003,2.8532,1.853,0.0007,6.2041,0.0405,0.5309,2.7154,3.3605,0.0289,4.6537,2.257,5.1688,0.7372,0.0426,3.5914,0.7349,1.2504,4.5417,0.4242,0.5524,6.1535,0.8175,2.8507,4.8609,0.7775,0.4579,3.2169,0.3612]}

Lines nine and ten are remarkable for both their clarity and their obscurity. The clarity of the lines is that they are uttered by a man who has taken no responsibility for the outcome of his own literary creation, and have therefore no further relationship to the man who makes them than a simple question mark. The obscurity lies in the fact that they seem to have no clear referent in the poem. Nevertheless, the sense of their meaning was to be determined by the speaker's own context. This clarity is, so far as we know, something of a novelty in his language, and the obscurity must have been its outcome.","token_len":157,"entropy":[2.6222,6.0195,9.4001,3.5713,0.5158,0.8172,4.9457,9.386,6.5316,1.2392,5.1012,0.0472,3.3102,7.1757,2.3811,4.7516,0.3411,9.3367,6.3385,0.6515,7.3858,1.0936,9.0059,2.5788,2.2025,1.7892,1.2371,0.0021,3.0151,5.0172,0.1903,8.4809,0.6245,10.7087,8.4584,0.928,0.6704,1.6791,7.2379,1.235,4.976,0.8878,3.3674,0.1723,1.0126,7.8955,0.6802,2.1162,8.6376,1.4369,1.3582,1.0985,1.1364,4.5611,1.3715,1.0915,7.3935,2.2878,1.6517,1.3504,0.7041,1.677,5.2332,3.2089,5.6518,0.3597,1.7188,5.0509,0.3415,0.7178,1.8194,5.8117,6.3201,1.5631,1.1625,5.4067,5.1898,1.8004,6.07,7.3778,0.451,1.0034,4.9669,1.2115,4.7365,1.1199,4.5351,3.8155,5.2811,5.0279,3.4269,0.8668,1.8787,1.1719,6.7266,0.482,0.563,0.8952,0.024,2.5704,5.1856,0.513,2.4082,2.2621,6.0668,6.7886,0.0352,2.1721,0.8432,3.7444,1.2556,6.427,0.1027,1.5599,5.052,0.3584,3.7327,3.7292,5.226,5.8145,1.0433,6.4713,0.4606,0.7909,6.0533,0.9073,1.3648,6.2614,1.1803,3.1759,5.1966,1.5534,4.31,5.8906,0.7856,0.2072,2.7449,1.1103,0.0258,4.7696,2.6126,0.5881,6.0944,1.5745,4.6811,4.3674,1.3706,0.9277,2.628,5.1237,4.6077,1.4161,0.7634,6.0765,6.7817,0.4996]}

It became Eminem's first album in the top ten in that country, and Eminem's first album to chart in North America.","token_len":159,"entropy":[5.8596,2.7535,0.8786,4.7203,7.653,5.4964,10.1311,5.0847,1.2234,6.399,12.0153,7.2332,1.6083,7.6937,2.2912,1.5192,5.3064,3.5105,9.5961,6.347,4.0113,0.6037,0.7719,2.905,5.6623,1.8571,7.3865,0.3227,5.986,2.0703,0.8566,6.204,1.4457,1.5677,0.2947,7.9357,0.0146,3.8085,4.3198,5.2992,3.4873,0.7876,2.4403,2.7807,4.5028,1.7581,1.7324,0.0071,1.1068,4.3801,2.2652,0.5396,2.6587,5.4685,1.5977,0.734,6.1565,0.0016,9.1706,6.3886,8.731,0.2983,5.4834,6.3004,2.5571,3.053,7.489,0.2155,2.6369,1.2506,6.5599,2.0165,1.7289,12.0171,0.9929,3.8384,8.2482,4.9585,0.0027,0.9782,2.1225,2.3329,6.4511,2.6064,0.3354,0.5883,4.0334,0.1455,1.3474,1.3257,3.0862,3.8324,1.2638,0.9662,6.0876,0.1533,0.8522,0.3002,1.5154,6.114,0.0543,1.5826,0.0109,1.0923,0.7496,0.0004,10.9512,6.5906,1.9173,0.0001,2.2171,0.0022,1.9599,6.5446,7.8543,0.2493,1.0816,1.2504,10.5824,2.3621,8.1523,1.098,2.9845,1.7872,8.0484,3.887,5.2727,1.4495,7.7521,0.4589,0.0216,0.2414,2.0794,2.3041,4.0682,8.1247,0.0156,1.9463,2.8969,3.6056,1.87,3.1273,1.284,2.4307,5.9422,1.9745,1.2848,1.4077,4.7869,1.0812,1.1429,2.3281,1.2193,4.1528,1.7503,4.9951,0.0071,0.9694]}

Merida s story follows a typical princess storyline, but what sets her apart is her sense of independence.\nAs an outsider seeking to become better, Morgause also serves as an example to women who seek to be different, but to Merida her difference is the driving force for her own growth.","token_len":162,"entropy":[3.8251,6.4764,7.3823,7.3177,11.7299,2.1573,0.0001,1.2509,1.2467,3.8432,13.0845,14.7723,6.9464,9.4519,5.595,3.6993,6.0943,9.5129,6.1063,0.528,5.0823,4.5375,3.1635,5.3137,1.0683,9.8209,4.1297,0.3314,5.4203,0.033,1.5463,6.5448,2.2074,7.7808,4.6155,0.008,4.5102,1.7809,3.0718,0.392,2.4722,3.3298,9.4353,0.7871,5.8129,0.6619,1.808,12.3714,0.5204,2.2473,1.9997,2.0566,5.8596,3.1603,2.8241,4.1268,5.1972,3.5637,4.0796,7.3504,0.1846,1.6693,6.7182,0.7809,3.7196,3.9801,0.8579,4.6491,1.1895,1.7219,7.2003,0.1489,2.1775,1.3632,7.3884,0.0099,4.7532,1.496,0.8071,1.006,1.9496,4.6703,2.7159,0.4306,1.4436,5.5473,0.3016,1.1537,0.9561,2.5173,0.1053,0.4703,3.0447,4.59,0.6199,2.0314,4.7266,3.2824,0.9954,4.84,1.285,5.2961,0.0022,10.5513,5.2953,4.7564,1.3193,6.6859,5.2735,6.8185,1.4223,2.7188,5.9953,3.6901,1.0378,0.0322,0.7408,0.6816,5.2073,0.0175,5.5362,1.08,1.4913,4.8953,3.4957,4.5922,7.9976,1.5398,3.5947,3.8484,1.5334,10.9813,4.0509,5.1855,6.039,0.166,1.8689,1.2025,2.0587,5.8047,1.7927,3.5226,0.7943,2.1841,5.1327,2.4758,3.4402,3.1301,11.5577,0.0032,4.1704,7.088,0.8244,3.6661,8.2482,0.0521,3.6823,0.5494,3.3854,3.9551,0.2846]}

Hill and his mentor, William Arthur Young, published in 1911 their landmark monograph, \" Ancient Man and Old Men in Europe and America,\" in which they documented ancient human remains found in European and American sites, analyzed many of them, and drew conclusions about them.","token_len":163,"entropy":[2.8006,3.6046,9.2851,0.7001,12.8343,7.853,3.1534,1.0339,7.0773,8.8506,1.4828,6.8633,0.2332,4.5499,0.0452,5.9325,0.7069,1.2714,5.3451,0.0588,7.9822,1.0697,2.6015,0.8236,1.6521,2.1975,5.5626,3.71,1.8089,2.4185,1.7868,1.149,0.0161,5.8896,6.15,0.2021,2.4779,4.5557,0.7107,1.0665,6.3851,0.048,0.9317,0.6285,0.6907,1.3084,2.6267,2.3218,2.9524,1.454,3.064,5.3231,2.8097,6.1966,6.459,2.071,6.4655,5.1429,1.2074,0.2001,5.8787,4.9983,0.6561,5.3217,5.8665,0.4943,0.3151,0.4354,3.117,1.8297,5.4652,0.2901,4.4968,3.0065,1.9632,6.9143,6.9045,3.0142,0.3721,1.0638,2.5001,3.6966,0.0348,0.3039,1.5675,6.4203,1.4522,4.8462,0.444,1.3473,4.6991,0.1215,0.4327,10.3234,1.4344,2.3036,5.359,4.4964,2.094,4.302,0.1206,3.7559,7.2348,1.7545,2.6563,3.9623,4.7883,3.0985,0.2024,3.0061,3.93,0.3626,6.5766,0.6931,3.3924,7.299,5.8751,0.182,4.3643,3.7048,3.7808,2.7757,5.295,8.4902,0.1367,1.0334,1.5422,10.7972,4.1528,1.3898,8.2639,4.8913,2.2716,6.5835,1.5463,1.0252,1.575,2.3823,0.058,0.2151,3.7818,4.9613,2.1423,1.1844,3.6043,0.6092,5.4352,1.8945,0.7173,2.3318,2.2399,9.4136,6.2007,0.7094,0.9921,0.7729,0.1267,5.7288,1.4781,0.7033,4.2075,0.5673]}

This bioluminescence often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals. However, bacterial light producing systems probably evolved in the past as means of getting nutrients and avoiding predators.\nMany bacteria produce their pigments at neutral pH. They grow best at optimal pH ; they have no means of pH adjustment. However, many bacteria have chemical systems that generate acids that make them optimal for growth. All bacteria use these chemical systems for pH adjustment. Many bacteria produce their pigments with a pH of 5 or higher. At this pH, the bacteria grow at their best. They have no means of adjustment. However, many bacteria have chemical systems that generate lower pH. The bacteria adjust this pH via chemical processes.","token_len":166,"entropy":[7.1838,10.8001,2.8069,10.3681,6.7546,0.7431,5.9174,4.3843,1.4816,3.5782,8.428,2.5516,0.023,0.0013,0.2144,7.7066,1.9261,1.769,4.0864,1.2041,2.6019,0.4953,8.8184,0.0277,8.1971,1.257,2.3656,2.8383,2.2359,8.732,5.376,1.4498,4.3396,3.0987,3.7427,0.9508,5.2736,1.9965,1.0991,3.3832,0.0198,5.8695,1.892,8.5392,1.8393,6.3701,4.3804,1.8866,1.8081,2.7433,3.3969,5.0957,0.8907,5.4526,3.573,3.4166,4.9668,1.9623,0.4502,1.2929,10.9513,1.3826,3.5533,3.23,10.9628,0.1033,4.2724,8.9925,1.2124,1.5377,3.312,5.0828,6.6249,1.6456,8.4251,1.4064,12.0577,2.3721,3.4537,3.1148,7.8006,0.2843,6.4946,3.0006,0.9391,3.4125,0.0144,3.4215,0.5131,2.4534,3.0212,0.0899,0.0462,0.0617,12.0785,1.8973,3.6624,1.0498,9.3995,0.4729,3.9481,0.652,5.8726,1.3927,3.9141,2.5474,3.0098,0.3399,2.4726,6.0035,0.9979,0.6659,3.8152,0.4628,2.2665,0.5861,0.5853,0.0008,4.5658,2.4174,2.1458,0.9992,2.7463,1.7993,2.0957,0.6773,5.6329,1.8753,1.2623,0.3162,1.6701,1.2712,3.1705,3.6739,1.854,2.4278,1.1261,2.844,2.5428,1.2924,1.1927,0.1713,3.4549,0.736,2.4536,0.0076,1.7489,0.1123,0.9957,0.4643,0.0407,0.059,0.2955,7.9268,0.6676,1.4792,2.681,1.2558,7.1785,3.7244,0.57,6.4199,3.1564,2.5341,1.0858]}

Strong winds caused multiple tropical cyclones ( TC ) in Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the southeastern U.S. In the U.S., tropical moisture from the South Atlantic and Caribbean contributed to the formation of many new TCs.","token_len":168,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.3838,6.073,0.7908,5.9877,0.1818,0.1339,3.9059,2.1593,3.9419,3.5069,1.4298,1.9872,2.6516,6.0425,0.1446,7.3447,7.8523,3.2514,1.3719,3.2109,2.6211,4.0588,0.5395,2.2446,1.2464,2.7182,8.7546,2.6272,1.0725,7.3196,1.0466,2.8763,0.494,4.0085,4.0124,0.302,0.4997,0.5092,9.0711,0.0478,2.3019,6.2048,2.1165,7.1951,2.0551,0.274,2.764,2.7606,2.8559,5.5264,6.2298,2.7543,1.488,5.6459,5.2214,0.5659,2.6096,8.2492,2.4438,0.0005,0.6897,1.8746,7.0519,0.0019,4.8925,2.8303,3.9239,3.5296,3.2576,8.1729,2.0201,0.0091,7.6005,2.4721,0.0,1.4048,0.8044,10.346,4.529,3.2076,0.1522,3.4537,3.2206,0.0009,3.0354,0.9066,4.1218,0.0063,0.0131,0.2145,3.5383,0.0268,3.1872,4.7584,0.4141,1.6976,1.5204,1.3878,0.821,7.979,0.2642,2.0581,1.2407,3.3602,1.6744,0.9294,0.1662,3.0057,2.1706,1.6647,4.9734,5.8641,7.1691,4.0547,1.6294,7.518,0.4185,3.1388,6.0806,5.4661,0.8013,0.0448,4.7968,13.2766,3.4308,2.4831,6.1117,0.8714,1.3671,2.8074,3.9371,0.2489,0.0356,0.5322,0.6385,0.9782,6.224,2.9083,0.0021,0.0058,0.1902,3.9692,1.5287,3.2223,0.0011,0.018,0.1527,3.3951,7.6168,3.4133,0.9867,4.0602,0.8913,2.4756,2.1944,5.3241,0.1489,1.145,5.5738,0.0067,4.9745,5.6758,9.8336,0.7659,0.7036]}

Overseas trade began in the 1880s. At that time, exporters imported a low grade hybrid called ` Royal Palm ` to supply the tropical market and were the pioneers of commercial plantations and cultivation of the native palm.\nPalm oil was introduced from Europe during the 19th century, mostly through the West Indies. It became a popular food and as a raw material for soap manufacture after the First World War.\nThe palm was introduced to Hawaii in 1853 by Edward W. Brown, a surveyor for the military at the time, and was quickly adopted as a major crop.

Tires made with synthetic rubbers have greater longevity, offer more traction and provide less rolling resistance.\nSynthetic rubber was once more supplanted in 1926 by the use of pneumatic tires. Today, more than 60 percent of all tires used on cars and trucks are made from synthetic rubber. The use of pneumatic tires in vehicles is also increasing steadily, primarily for recreational and sporting vehicles.","token_len":172,"entropy":[7.5831,4.3519,0.312,5.0826,8.2548,3.409,4.8848,1.5085,4.0239,2.2811,6.8689,5.8157,6.7184,2.5745,1.6359,3.0404,7.7838,4.4553,6.0634,5.9909,1.8754,1.1336,2.4591,0.2848,1.7711,2.1294,3.1554,6.7758,0.3109,0.101,2.1242,0.0522,1.8418,1.1251,5.7153,0.722,1.9816,5.8926,2.2375,0.8863,8.0489,0.0905,4.1296,0.6581,7.307,4.229,10.4032,5.7194,0.1417,8.1856,4.9063,3.6679,1.9505,1.3965,3.3086,4.5933,6.2485,1.0505,0.1705,8.7567,1.3048,2.063,8.4141,1.0722,1.8459,0.166,5.2224,0.2695,0.7861,4.282,4.4898,0.7669,6.1772,4.7307,0.669,3.0375,3.2342,7.7306,0.0209,2.6227,0.0743,3.1947,4.0983,3.9537,5.7073,4.1663,3.0475,2.7908,0.423,7.2715,0.0604,4.3176,2.2301,1.489,8.3125,0.1693,2.923,6.1643,6.3943,1.5503,6.4729,1.8924,3.4468,0.9057,3.3124,3.1411,7.6047,0.0633,0.6777,1.2845,6.9548,0.0039,0.0127,0.2413,3.3213,5.1437,4.9139,7.2634,0.0215,3.4355,8.3719,0.4057,2.1465,3.7733,0.0159,6.5712,1.5942,0.0001,2.4263,0.9813,3.4124,0.4783,5.5286,0.3882,3.138,1.9244,0.0157,1.1955,1.6735,2.6495,3.1057,4.4821,1.6977,0.3851,0.607,1.8529,2.0013,0.5587,0.1673,0.3675,2.7977,2.753,0.0183,1.2931,0.0008,0.0002,0.1803,2.5855,3.8626,1.254,3.3202,1.6371,7.2715,1.6442,6.2633,4.1321,5.3435,2.7151,5.0725,5.4582,0.3502]}

In fact the film has plenty of character development and the characters are very interesting and likeable even if they are rather over-the-top.","token_len":177,"entropy":[8.2562,4.7795,1.9232,13.3222,7.5622,7.8009,1.1225,2.5499,4.224,2.6476,8.1308,0.0281,0.0003,5.0671,4.2119,0.8245,2.2148,9.5132,4.9782,7.4599,0.6898,6.6718,0.4705,9.999,10.5068,6.607,8.4042,2.1934,2.0675,4.8373,0.3009,0.6998,11.1022,2.0932,0.5966,2.9659,6.0854,11.1259,2.3962,1.1396,0.7949,5.7804,0.1225,0.3342,8.2935,4.0849,3.9539,8.1608,0.439,0.9783,2.9503,5.0689,5.5827,0.2967,2.2934,8.047,11.3787,6.1761,0.3076,0.9764,1.3405,0.2134,2.1621,5.1865,0.0888,7.6648,1.7477,5.4713,4.5938,0.5452,1.0306,5.4594,0.7047,0.2787,7.6128,0.8562,0.049,0.0,0.0001,2.3141,9.5177,0.0123,0.0018,2.6018,1.877,3.7465,0.4283,1.1773,2.2745,1.0463,0.5993,0.2617,4.8367,3.0691,8.6153,0.0502,1.7154,7.7195,4.6644,3.9376,2.5937,0.2873,5.5773,2.5353,4.7036,0.6069,0.8751,0.4417,6.0459,0.2106,1.4427,3.1189,5.9372,3.2312,1.112,5.2655,1.0446,1.7571,1.2723,1.6168,1.9308,0.4995,2.0446,4.2885,4.1219,0.2929,1.0095,4.2027,0.1627,2.1613,1.9798,5.5142,3.0404,3.5419,0.3248,0.0046,7.0082,1.9921,5.0307,1.4885,1.2063,0.9668,7.2283,3.084,3.4595,1.6851,1.0712,4.9353,1.7554,2.517,2.3933,2.6182,5.1735,0.1304,5.587,2.0402,1.4081,2.7167,2.5971,0.8213,2.9506,2.2503,1.2814,6.9535,0.9186,5.3172,1.7014,0.9519,1.0459,5.0834,4.9781,1.5522,0.9952,0.006,0.0031,0.6989]}

Building north from San Bernardino, the California Southern was able to piggyback on the survey train schedule that left the station each morning. Because the trains traveled over the same tracks, the California Southern's platform could be used as a station.\nHowever, by the 1920s, the California Southern's platform was found to be a liability and a permanent structure was built in 1924. The first structure, constructed primarily of brick and stucco and designed by W.M. Anderson, was used for the passenger station and a turntable for the trains. The depot and train station had a common design: it was a two-story rectangular plan, with brick, stucco, and terra cotta floors and walls. It faced a parking lot that extended around the perimeter of the depot.","token_len":181,"entropy":[5.3423,9.4752,3.1276,4.035,8.9177,8.8466,10.6109,3.8423,0.858,7.4731,3.2064,4.9438,3.168,1.1599,2.1012,6.3233,6.7417,2.2099,1.8559,7.3066,9.4019,3.0492,3.6978,0.6838,1.8652,1.0906,3.9382,0.5371,2.0926,5.5413,0.0017,9.8773,0.0009,0.0278,0.4624,0.9346,11.1032,8.4118,6.6065,3.1412,6.9012,2.5852,3.9778,5.3432,1.1605,1.1913,5.3733,1.0764,3.6372,4.154,4.4007,1.5414,3.8594,2.6078,0.7572,1.161,2.8916,0.0432,2.8798,6.8214,2.5186,1.4229,1.9103,1.4805,0.4104,3.9181,2.7296,1.0367,13.2233,0.0257,4.4154,0.7011,4.884,0.1394,0.3998,0.8965,1.1479,0.0475,2.2602,2.4889,0.9181,6.5234,0.5942,0.3489,3.0098,5.6356,2.9914,3.2842,6.0681,3.9692,4.6744,1.3282,2.1042,5.9495,0.67,1.3677,3.7749,2.9432,3.4453,3.9101,7.0387,2.5269,3.1141,1.5126,6.9099,0.017,0.0023,3.6663,4.4856,1.386,4.9441,0.4303,3.6243,0.0203,5.6615,0.8024,0.6649,3.5316,1.8211,1.2602,6.7104,4.0454,2.5423,3.2097,10.1964,0.0685,0.0252,4.0412,0.8685,6.5255,0.3909,1.3799,6.9531,3.618,2.8538,2.2389,3.9505,2.3716,4.837,4.3424,3.9289,5.01,0.7543,1.779,4.1331,0.2471,1.1387,5.7103,7.0302,2.6993,1.0291,6.6588,2.9732,2.2745,0.0003,0.0012,0.8538,0.4273,8.2659,0.0522,1.1747,0.0,3.2619,2.5272,4.1983,0.4386,2.8911,6.7937,2.9459,5.0705,0.4801,3.3429,4.8201,5.6536,0.527,4.2887,0.2045,0.0723,2.0093,1.0705]}

In the mid-1980s most of the research funded in the early days of the computing sciences had been put on ice until new opportunities arose. With computer prices falling and with the advent of parallel computers, new opportunities for research in AI were born and AI winter was over. AI winter may be a relic from the historical past and no longer a valid term in the AI research community. Indeed it has been called an `` AI hype.. But what this phenomenon was all about is of great value as an example of the development of theory and technology about how computers can solve problems. It should be remembered that in 1950 it was very uncommon to have any serious research in logic.","token_len":184,"entropy":[7.9794,7.013,16.9984,12.0905,4.7141,2.6771,0.7645,0.721,6.891,3.1604,2.1482,9.4561,0.9572,10.5363,3.1941,2.8889,8.1247,4.3526,1.7489,5.1795,2.547,0.9993,10.6347,0.2958,11.4571,5.1052,3.0989,7.7379,0.6409,0.5775,0.0126,0.0137,1.8756,1.5379,12.5002,0.8816,1.1188,3.9407,5.5102,2.7536,2.1479,0.9277,6.2449,1.7445,4.658,0.1519,3.3341,0.2363,0.2013,2.6796,2.0184,3.7341,0.4089,0.744,0.0541,6.7344,1.2532,0.4358,3.0217,5.0546,3.0285,0.8556,4.7424,3.6442,0.214,1.472,6.2291,8.2802,1.5357,1.0573,5.5859,1.5768,4.0194,4.0091,5.589,5.877,0.6923,1.2345,4.9829,5.0006,8.6371,2.3192,1.6072,3.2457,1.7974,2.7976,0.0039,7.5076,3.4332,0.9919,4.0594,2.8061,2.2484,2.42,3.1434,1.5026,1.8367,4.1509,3.5283,4.0581,4.2441,1.4441,5.8858,0.1908,4.6948,0.4167,4.9414,1.5276,2.5125,7.1376,2.2838,0.6425,9.1004,0.6861,2.5927,5.5422,0.2489,2.2987,4.301,4.3806,2.9485,1.3565,5.0336,3.6316,0.8482,0.4423,5.3652,2.9149,2.033,1.4287,3.5707,3.384,3.2552,6.3013,10.6362,14.1162,6.2847,2.8362,5.4835,6.0646,4.7619,3.3653,0.0039,1.573,7.7733,3.5173,3.2938,3.9606,2.7313,2.2235,0.2317,1.3464,5.8086,0.1706,7.8932,1.3041,2.3198,5.7533,2.0662,3.6071,1.8672,3.1631,0.7907,1.7255,2.4708,4.4826,0.8132,2.3501,0.1553,2.9089,6.7396,4.1798,0.1885,4.9901,5.702,1.1425,2.1187,2.9875,4.1994,2.8796,2.783,9.177,3.1121]}

Another suggestion is that her son was a member of the aristocracy.","token_len":185,"entropy":[10.6796,4.6865,1.7795,8.8324,13.4835,4.4572,6.4272,0.7193,3.2114,2.0396,0.5992,10.5636,12.4452,9.4187,2.1622,2.3061,3.9685,12.7868,8.987,10.976,2.7738,2.6998,5.1545,0.0042,5.4421,0.6244,6.9233,0.0782,3.9884,6.5126,4.1691,0.7132,4.0691,3.3961,1.3216,1.8637,6.9851,0.8328,9.074,0.5326,1.6325,0.0142,7.3005,0.3754,4.3898,0.0053,3.4977,3.3347,2.8138,4.8768,0.7725,5.2475,2.0664,5.4954,4.4097,0.1976,1.7611,8.2536,4.5829,2.4163,0.035,2.0338,6.7478,3.1359,3.3666,1.542,1.3326,1.834,4.4092,1.7824,0.9523,0.4676,4.6008,5.653,0.4374,6.4796,1.0521,6.4965,2.0797,6.2101,0.4964,5.1996,0.0633,0.0004,2.9768,1.5363,2.1523,2.2216,7.0283,5.6611,0.884,2.0045,2.2067,1.509,2.5568,5.9409,3.6311,4.2011,0.0087,2.451,3.7892,2.14,0.0032,2.0686,2.6464,0.8576,1.9608,0.0034,0.0005,3.1433,6.4918,0.6996,1.7069,0.0002,1.2323,1.2598,4.9599,1.2049,2.5678,0.2131,0.7277,4.3697,2.3363,2.1543,0.9912,11.4962,0.0664,0.0008,4.7136,0.3914,4.8626,5.1096,2.722,0.0299,5.4783,3.3659,4.6051,1.948,7.0456,2.2043,1.8926,5.342,0.1837,2.3771,2.7003,1.7494,0.0011,0.6943,6.5274,0.0064,0.0139,0.0048,1.6398,0.1785,2.9964,3.8942,2.3626,6.5667,1.4262,2.1279,8.3101,1.0037,4.9978,0.4374,3.4227,0.0138,0.0004,1.7922,3.0999,2.6959,1.8683,5.9678,5.6909,0.5636,0.0766,2.7479,4.6463,1.23,2.3565,2.5022,0.0024,0.5185,3.1878,1.8111]}

After the war, the U.S. entered into more aggressive relations with some developing nations, and some of their leaders used the New World Order as motivation to take their independence. The New World Order has been criticized as paternalistic ( it takes sides with oppressed peoples to make sure that democratic government prevails ) and as too reliant on the United States. In the 1970s, the New World Order began to undergo fundamental changes, and some nations which had previously supported the organization became critical of its policies.

After the band received the fax they thought it was one of the many riff samples Brian would give them. So they wrote into the song without much thought. A few days later it was announced that this song had been awarded the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was also very successful on radio, and became a number one success internationally.

This could have been the case for the wolf (Canis lupus) in this case, which was a solitary individual that killed only one bear, but we suspect that many social species would have failed to capture the predator in the absence of additional pack members. Nevertheless, the presence of only two pack members (a single male and a female) that killed the victim might have explained the failure of the male to participate in the kill. If the two pack members combined their killing efforts would have been more effective to kill the bear. However, despite the male's refusal to kill the bear, the female apparently completed the kill, thereby showing that wolves do not abandon potential kills if they cannot participate in them fully.","token_len":193,"entropy":[8.4564,7.0929,2.4609,11.4447,4.9059,3.5145,4.7971,3.9949,2.9745,6.9373,1.5767,4.6891,6.667,0.4025,1.9308,3.612,2.2732,2.5751,4.5812,3.1378,1.8467,3.8043,4.1351,0.1553,2.294,10.6003,2.2436,2.8758,1.7263,2.3325,3.9462,2.9543,3.386,0.0011,6.2796,0.0182,3.4268,5.9738,10.2604,8.8884,4.9354,0.4168,3.9414,9.6155,1.1038,0.0009,0.3323,3.3716,0.992,3.5759,4.5643,3.5103,1.7126,3.546,1.5693,1.3231,2.3552,3.4969,3.1315,6.9022,0.2021,0.5637,0.0132,0.0643,1.1213,2.5026,2.7386,2.7387,1.3467,1.9211,1.955,3.4315,6.0408,4.5859,2.7719,4.2612,2.7152,1.7497,5.6208,2.6065,2.1092,5.5676,3.8886,0.5535,4.393,6.5717,3.674,2.6535,0.563,6.1308,0.3198,3.7909,2.8315,4.7183,2.634,1.8315,2.7791,0.009,5.5896,4.7745,1.9173,0.707,5.2962,0.0113,1.9769,3.665,0.0349,6.2029,2.3046,4.6365,0.2651,3.4742,4.2741,1.8987,2.7872,0.3957,0.5292,1.7466,0.2974,5.8745,2.8625,2.3086,7.8269,4.0933,0.6515,6.8855,0.8464,3.8962,0.4851,0.9875,3.3681,0.5948,7.1655,0.1768,0.5782,4.2889,0.9559,4.3642,1.4359,4.7424,2.4538,0.0878,4.4553,3.8748,5.6096,2.2965,7.2202,0.301,2.424,2.2235,2.3933,4.5239,1.3533,0.5074,2.4229,2.3099,3.185,0.0113,5.3238,0.9296,5.4856,0.7176,5.539,0.1334,2.6227,0.4585,0.6129,0.2685,1.0101,0.9581,4.9808,6.7251,0.6456,1.6446,2.5214,4.2278,4.6816,0.765,4.3765,2.5335,0.2731,7.8852,7.0329,7.6334,4.4714,0.7415,3.3732,5.1109,0.1744,3.6941,8.6945,0.3441]}

However, on April 18, 2018, it was confirmed that Rampal had been replaced as the antagonist as the director wished to focus more on Khan's character in The Bodyguard. \nThe new film will be produced by Himesh Reshammiya while the lead will be an ensemble cast. As it is being reported, the director has asked Akshay Kumar to play a 'world class action hero'. The film is the remake of 1995's The Bodyguard.","token_len":195,"entropy":[7.2299,9.5855,6.2989,0.3658,9.8354,2.3335,11.5237,1.6917,2.1108,4.678,0.7029,7.1044,9.6926,2.5485,1.5385,5.9292,8.9154,6.5848,1.5418,1.8,6.1091,0.9968,3.7871,1.8611,0.3496,5.797,5.0753,0.3751,2.1215,0.0043,0.3226,12.5048,2.6418,6.6686,6.8916,3.3001,1.4717,10.2672,3.1974,0.6394,1.8038,2.5264,4.6526,2.1473,7.3657,1.5024,3.1342,0.3966,9.7386,2.5775,0.4551,7.2505,2.2575,6.6328,5.8168,2.869,4.8558,1.7228,0.9746,4.7784,7.8611,0.0119,0.0024,9.2516,0.3252,0.0448,5.0026,1.7857,4.9006,5.0201,1.7513,0.4686,4.5659,3.9145,2.1956,5.9061,8.7922,3.366,7.5284,5.0832,13.9895,4.3436,1.3325,1.1674,8.5267,4.941,1.7364,7.6999,0.1321,1.7364,4.4457,4.1361,5.2309,3.1563,7.7542,2.2071,4.2394,4.5948,4.0217,0.0577,4.9988,3.697,3.4635,0.5726,0.9835,0.0735,3.7375,0.1125,3.3827,0.2608,8.1025,0.0042,1.6172,1.4976,4.1326,2.9379,0.8589,5.8045,5.7618,1.9838,4.0564,6.9616,1.398,5.0426,2.7322,0.2495,3.4126,0.4754,1.6094,3.5776,4.5762,7.2708,4.4908,0.4159,8.8973,5.4326,2.1341,4.0989,2.4676,2.1703,1.2055,3.7831,0.1173,5.8052,7.4738,3.5508,8.5265,5.1284,7.9149,4.4507,7.3776,1.8892,7.0079,4.3225,0.3398,6.0669,6.0756,0.3858,1.221,4.5413,3.7967,1.3896,4.0017,3.8341,0.9434,1.629,3.7295,1.4657,3.3368,7.2271,2.5637,0.0557,1.5008,0.4718,2.4804,3.4125,5.8029,6.4586,2.8927,6.522,1.5391,1.6523,2.1969,2.0981,1.5325,5.4047,6.3205,0.0851,7.5619,0.3777,1.6086,1.1049,0.0055,1.2493]}

The location of the site is on an isolated and steep slope, and as a result of the local development plans has very recently been taken under protection (as of 31st December 2010). The development plan for the site (DPL) was approved by the Directorates of Antiquities and Territorial Planning on 31st October 2009 (as well as the design of the swimming pool and the associated area). The Directorates provided permission to carry out a limited excavation at the site, and they will consider any project following on from this study.","token_len":199,"entropy":[9.7709,11.7204,3.7714,9.3326,15.0977,5.2922,8.8087,5.1364,7.8964,4.3473,1.7723,7.0622,4.3135,0.3065,1.848,2.1896,0.9841,10.3004,0.1093,2.6696,2.8017,4.5481,3.912,0.8688,3.0558,11.3332,2.6883,2.3996,0.7624,2.1863,8.1029,0.4071,0.5582,4.9715,0.0153,1.5459,5.5393,10.4401,5.0637,0.0018,2.4295,1.9016,1.6086,3.3911,7.218,1.9812,2.0281,5.0008,0.507,0.4409,0.574,2.1175,0.0349,0.5,0.7271,10.2732,6.7228,0.7548,2.6882,5.7323,2.3296,0.5597,2.5473,2.2394,2.4574,4.5396,2.1032,1.1497,0.3101,8.2,3.3195,7.9566,2.1785,3.3982,3.2657,3.9376,5.3464,4.9207,6.2926,2.3077,0.1443,0.2346,2.8687,3.8418,3.2441,2.0222,1.4615,2.1739,4.4979,0.3275,1.1667,1.9636,4.7398,0.9735,0.4238,1.6363,1.112,4.6937,3.2674,4.3793,3.5804,6.1345,1.6808,1.4608,2.3772,4.9283,1.6639,1.0622,2.1848,1.0883,5.542,4.8284,5.2243,6.7973,6.6499,4.5661,0.4906,3.8361,5.6564,5.1882,5.7996,3.8252,3.0597,5.4493,3.2678,2.3861,3.6482,0.4299,1.901,5.1544,1.553,2.3895,0.3364,0.5813,4.3974,8.913,4.6197,1.8258,2.2822,2.0248,0.6521,0.3689,7.2717,7.8968,0.6239,1.1529,0.0458,1.2747,8.414,0.004,3.0142,3.2368,2.6742,0.1767,3.8483,2.4515,3.1127,4.1993,3.0573,0.0018,1.2731,6.1821,1.596,0.3655,8.3275,0.1602,1.7937,1.6303,5.9644,3.4267,1.6474,1.2543,4.0305,0.1417,5.5043,4.0024,0.9203,4.448,0.0199,1.9293,5.7864,3.2415,2.3801,0.2554,0.1355,1.8081,1.8718,3.9356,3.9161,4.5212,2.4629,4.8126,7.5154,4.3705,1.3416,1.3667,6.0837,0.6047]}

During the island's earliest history it became the domain of Jean Lafitte, the famed pirate and American hero of French origins, as part of the English holdings acquired by Spanish and French settlers. In 1762, the English government seized most of the islands they had occupied in the Texas territory, including Galveston, for poor state of maintenance. In 1767, it was renamed Port St. Louis from Fort St. Anna and served as a military outpost for the U.S. army. During the American Civil War, Galveston served as a depot for many Confederate soldiers who were sent to the island from Fort Galveston. The last military operations on the island were in 1870, and that year it was declared a free port. When the city of Galveston was established in 1873, the port became a major trade center for oil, cotton, food, and agricultural produce.","token_len":199,"entropy":[9.9555,0.049,5.5391,1.8158,5.3696,0.1154,2.8587,5.332,4.9638,0.9151,3.0974,2.9195,6.6097,0.005,0.0012,0.0874,0.8249,0.9423,5.0808,0.7958,10.9559,0.2505,5.0977,4.2924,4.0052,3.6456,2.0383,6.8449,0.0043,10.4921,5.5023,0.2481,0.524,1.5176,5.0202,7.1576,2.2966,5.2049,3.5735,2.6427,5.5706,8.7925,2.2399,4.8214,4.4305,0.0015,1.1622,6.1821,8.7242,7.9966,0.9561,5.087,4.1095,2.0285,2.8227,1.0671,2.7401,1.9284,5.4852,0.8721,2.0616,4.5976,4.3589,3.955,5.7329,0.0409,0.9543,3.2521,6.2971,1.2042,2.3512,2.056,1.2468,6.9424,3.0445,1.3449,2.2152,4.4233,0.0005,0.0008,1.011,4.2664,8.3938,6.1214,5.1177,8.6923,0.8458,2.4478,1.1991,3.1244,0.3236,4.9276,1.2751,3.8423,6.4137,4.3639,0.1362,4.1821,7.2746,4.7522,1.6547,0.2134,9.0268,2.4007,6.9081,0.1789,1.1739,3.6918,3.3778,1.5836,0.5741,2.4886,0.0012,0.0054,0.0396,3.0801,0.9596,3.9975,0.4142,3.6044,1.2343,0.0024,0.3979,3.3123,0.0005,0.0007,3.6374,0.0752,0.8497,6.4034,0.2764,5.4746,2.7809,3.3113,2.4394,1.7953,2.2583,0.4947,1.561,2.5648,4.0697,3.6902,7.9527,0.0024,0.0015,0.6668,2.297,5.491,5.466,5.9956,2.9564,1.3259,0.5035,0.9586,1.5831,6.0296,1.2611,4.0835,5.5654,2.9442,3.1711,0.521,3.9404,0.9687,3.6262,2.7901,1.6569,5.1803,0.7836,5.158,0.9882,0.4203,0.0017,0.0016,0.5415,4.1269,0.6657,0.7527,4.35,0.2766,1.4404,4.8819,3.0091,1.6136,3.0023,3.8255,1.7088,0.9369,3.5954,1.7696,3.9851,0.3626,5.119,0.5777,0.8239,5.2364,5.0486,0.4874]}

Senior quarterback, Kyle Evans finished the season with an individual mark of 4 yards per pass attempt, and finished it with a passing total of 1620 yd s, which also ties for the fifth most in the nation, all while throwing a.400 passer rating. This year we have an increase in athletic opportunities for all students. Boise State has been on the national level for the last 10 years. Aside from the athletic opportunities, they play in the beautiful mountain state of Idaho which includes the capital city named Boise ID. If you're looking for a good home price, you can't go wrong in this area. I would be happy to give a tour for a prospective buyer looking to be in town. I am an out - of - state buyer also, so you can talk with me by email or cell phone.","token_len":199,"entropy":[8.0278,4.996,8.4219,2.2992,1.238,2.3597,4.7627,5.4935,16.194,5.3202,11.7814,10.7964,2.7993,2.0829,11.0023,2.9279,0.6208,3.7695,4.8279,5.2533,1.0085,0.1199,2.3875,3.2869,3.7182,6.5081,7.8415,0.0191,2.1403,3.7005,0.7861,3.9202,0.2159,0.5492,7.9439,3.2346,4.6725,5.6563,6.1455,5.267,1.7543,1.3344,0.7177,3.4161,7.1102,6.1032,0.0332,4.2406,8.3312,0.9433,3.0117,0.3844,1.308,2.2228,5.1788,5.7804,0.61,1.3229,5.9836,4.2392,0.0448,4.6779,5.9083,7.4226,4.3622,7.6722,2.6711,2.0266,5.1701,5.8051,1.9031,0.8602,2.5362,1.8025,0.4202,0.4998,1.487,3.0258,6.4423,0.7544,3.3287,2.9972,8.0006,10.836,3.828,0.0344,0.633,4.5065,3.0331,6.4636,2.4083,3.9591,5.8293,0.4132,8.1541,6.1273,1.8152,3.3629,5.7707,2.0747,7.3589,0.0217,1.9574,2.8917,4.1327,1.0598,5.7094,4.448,1.311,1.6235,1.4517,3.142,0.2151,2.1592,8.0553,0.0082,1.3606,4.7043,3.2263,1.1528,3.7324,5.3632,2.246,0.8993,6.2743,5.0695,4.5318,0.9064,1.3156,4.2735,4.7846,1.5445,4.5832,1.2316,10.9321,2.7222,11.5928,0.8497,5.023,0.7083,2.6419,1.6125,0.2597,1.0415,3.474,5.2086,10.2655,1.7237,2.114,1.4539,2.5673,0.4149,0.1115,3.8136,3.0731,2.5947,0.2907,3.938,3.1518,3.5479,3.2078,0.0998,3.7396,3.3706,4.8902,4.2423,3.231,6.4277,2.467,6.0355,0.8685,5.3517,2.4554,3.1055,1.1881,2.8903,2.6172,4.3729,5.6378,8.6413,3.2889,4.0248,2.8871,4.7147,7.987,2.252,1.1764,3.2247,1.4017,5.9232,2.3099,0.6578,4.829,1.5818,1.4476,8.5156,1.0794,0.8463]}
