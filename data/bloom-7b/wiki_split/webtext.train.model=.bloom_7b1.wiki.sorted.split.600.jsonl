In March","text":"During his final years, Wheeler remained involved in various activities, for instance sitting on the advisory panel of the Antiquity journal and the Management Committee of the Royal Archaeological Institute. In March 1959 he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society, while at the same time he retired from the Council of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society at the age of eighty-four years. In 1962 he received an honorary D C. Honorary degrees were received from the Universities of Pennsylvania, London and North Carolina, and from the University of Wales, Swansea. He was made an Ordnance officer, with a command attached, in recognition of his work as a mathematician. In October 1966 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the New Zealand Star on the recommendation of Sir John Fulton, F.R.S. In 1969 he was also awarded the O.B.E.\nIn 1953 his wife, who had been a member of the Ancient Philosophy Group at the C.J.D. Smith Library since 1946, died. A memorial tablet in the churchyard at Oldchurch commemorated her contribution to the collection.\nPapers and personal papers of G.D.S. Wheeler have now been made available for consultation by the Department of Ancient History, A. & C. Bell, University Library, Cambridge.\nWheeler wrote and edited a number of works on classical antiquity, including two of his classic series on'Religion in Ancient Time : the Early Cultures'( 1949 and 1961 ) and'Religion in Ancient Greece and Rome'( 1956 and 1964 ). These were followed by the first in a series of textbooks, Ancient Mysticism ( 1954 ) ; The Religion of the Greek People ( 1957 ) ; The Religion of Religion ( 1959 ) and Ancient Greece and Rome : a Social and Religious Profile ( 1961 ). A second edition of The Religion of Religion was published in 1961 with a prefatory chapter and an appendix of seven notes on the reception in ancient times of the doctrines of Pythagoras, Plato, Plato and Aristotle, Isocrates, and Cicero, and the author also wrote Religion and Politics in Ancient Greece and Rome ( 1963 ).\nAn important contribution to the study of classical political law and government was made in the publication in 1950 of the revised edition of Aristotle on government with a section relating specifically to the formation of empire in the classical world.

He was promoted to lieutenant in a brig, and after serving in Barbadoes, was in 1793 appointed quartermaster in the royal navy, and was appointed captain in the Mediterranean, in 1796, on a frigate, but died in charge of a frigate.\nThe Marjoribanks family went down to Cape Breton in the 1740s, first to St. John's in Nova Scotia; probably at a later date to Belfast. Thomas Marjoribanks, the grandfather of Lieutenant Alexander M., settled in Glasgow, where he served as comptroller of the Customs and Company Treasurer.\nHis wife was Catherine (n\u00e9e Robinson) and they had two daughters, Janet, who married Major Andrew Forbes of the Royal African Company and died in New York in 1843, and Margaret, who married Thomas Hussey of the Royal African Company, died in 1848 in Jamaica.\nIn 1795 they moved back to Britain, to London, and Alexander married his cousin Margaret and had another daughter (Margaret Lilly); the family moved to Cornwall, where Lieutenant Alexander continued to serve in the Royal Navy, till 1806. It was at this time (1805) that Captain Marjoribanks was appointed as captain of HMS The Royal Oak. On 9 August 1806 he sailed for India, taking with him Margaret, ten months old, and on 30 April 1807 he was in command of HMS\u00a0The Royal Phoenix. In July 1810 he was appointed lieutenant in HMS Venerable, and took her to South America, but was appointed commander of the frigate HMS\u00a0Nunavut in April 1811. A week later the ship sailed for Europe, and in August went back to London, to see his friends Thomas and Elizabeth Hussey, with whom he was staying.

Majestic underwent a refit in August and September with the conversion of the aircraft to airships.\nFlight operations began in October 1915, flying anti-submarine patrols of the English Channel and the North Sea.\n\nInter-war service\n\nBy December of that year the French, being involved in their own war with Germany, had acquired the aircraft, although they did not utilize Majestic in the conflict. Later, during the period of British neutrality following World War I, the USAAF and the Royal Australian Air Force acquired examples for service in the United States and Australia respectively.\nThe French operated Majestic as a long-range anti-shipping aircraft, used mostly for reconnaissance against naval targets. In May 1928, Majestic was operated by the French navy until July when it was transferred to the French aviation ministry (MAVNA). It was retained until July 1930 when it was repainted in the Royal Air Force's colors of red and green. In July 1930, the French government bought back the aircraft and flew it to Canada for use as a patrol aircraft. It was then painted in the Royal Canadian Air Force's color scheme of light blue on a tan base, and became known as Le Major in Canada.\nMajestic was retained for a couple of years, flying patrolling missions and later became the main RCAF reconnaissance aircraft through the 1930s and 1940s. It was mostly flown on night flights to patrol convoys and other air traffic before the introduction of radar in the form of the British Avro Ansatz.\nIn December 1938, Le Major flew on a raid on the Italian airfield at Oran. The RCAF was also given a job of escorting cargo across the Atlantic to Canada, and Le Major was the first Air Transport Command (ATC) aircraft to land on the ground at Canadian ports. This was an important project and it was used extensively afterwards when Canada's Royal Canadian Air Force was involved in missions in the Pacific Ocean and United States. It continued to be in use in the Royal Canadian Air Force through the war and for several months served with the RCAF in postwar operations in North Africa and the Azores, flying its last combat flight in 1944.\nIn 1941 the aircraft received its most comprehensive and expensive overhaul, which had it completely refitted. The original engines were removed and replaced by the larger engines of the Douglas Dart. During this time it lost most of its guns (most of these have been recovered).\nSeveral aircraft were acquired by the German fleet as reconnaissance aircraft and were nicknamed \"Pigs\" for their small size. After the war, the U.S. Army Air Forces used a few of these as experimental aircraft with a small armament of rocket cannons.\nIt later served as an aircraft carrier's observer before being scrapped at Burbank California in 1957.","token_len":602,"entropy":[2.2367,5.8137,0.3093,1.6571,0.0018,0.906,3.4304,4.045,1.9313,0.1376,8.3436,3.805,4.1255,2.0699,3.7354,0.0407,0.3051,7.4723,1.4372,7.9964,4.2562,1.3355,3.0304,0.1813,1.4047,9.8572,4.9132,1.4292,3.7802,0.0022,6.773,1.3888,7.1423,0.0729,1.5771,2.4323,3.1582,5.6032,4.534,0.9482,7.6186,0.563,1.1073,4.3395,0.9795,5.3961,5.5666,1.0716,2.1853,13.5993,5.5798,3.2925,0.9284,2.3036,2.5785,1.7592,5.2587,8.9908,0.0366,2.6406,0.0024,2.564,4.2696,0.6804,4.55,0.1012,1.5977,1.8941,3.3148,0.359,0.6175,2.3762,7.8106,9.295,3.5849,3.31,3.376,1.3596,0.0006,3.8929,3.3966,2.5381,1.3204,0.0122,2.4878,6.0061,3.7725,6.4465,5.5373,0.105,5.1851,2.1522,2.2327,2.1738,1.2631,0.2431,2.028,5.7173,1.4911,3.5407,2.6342,4.8435,1.97,2.7028,0.0743,6.7013,8.3569,0.0024,2.9832,1.6837,6.441,0.4569,5.7592,1.4353,2.8161,0.3704,4.6695,0.4807,4.9844,5.7054,5.6463,1.6268,0.0027,0.2116,0.1233,0.9805,5.8219,0.9737,2.3075,1.4352,2.4416,3.8152,0.1529,0.0333,3.8535,10.3054,4.8696,5.4758,1.4547,0.6958,5.6157,0.6664,2.3435,3.0915,3.3425,0.2208,0.6384,13.8252,4.1402,6.5782,4.7609,0.0016,2.5654,0.8946,6.0142,0.2977,0.1922,2.9526,0.0036,8.7052,0.3199,1.7472,1.5594,4.6932,4.6748,1.3278,2.1608,5.7075,4.8234,0.7786,0.8304,2.5131,3.7814,7.6584,0.4098,2.492,0.0018,0.6066,6.0198,0.5561,0.4512,2.1129,3.5563,4.4089,4.0223,6.1133,0.3789,0.2431,1.5754,0.0861,0.3153,2.9695,7.1533,4.3937,4.506,7.1731,4.4245,4.4279,0.5048,3.4498,0.6956,5.0365,2.0063,3.4153,5.1659,1.0716,0.7011,0.1867,5.192,0.8805,2.1721,1.981,4.7008,3.2033,0.0866,2.1172,3.6428,1.5039,1.8468,0.7602,2.4331,0.3941,2.5197,2.677,2.7815,0.3829,1.1629,1.5758,3.6182,4.8982,6.4935,0.5597,0.5309,1.4585,5.0526,0.4153,2.3989,6.1383,2.1086,2.9434,1.7343,0.7158,3.7317,0.7785,0.6302,3.3533,0.6839,3.1873,5.1751,1.1244,1.1264,1.7175,3.0208,0.5787,0.0261,1.0704,3.3051,4.5702,1.1785,5.0968,1.1966,5.6124,3.7031,8.4872,3.803,2.5199,1.939,5.232,2.7617,0.0589,7.2591,6.4515,4.0841,2.5486,0.5192,0.6831,11.8657,0.0069,0.0009,0.7409,5.6887,2.0202,2.9908,4.6954,0.0662,0.2826,2.4944,4.2197,6.032,1.8816,3.7632,5.8373,5.8068,1.8832,2.5411,9.3665,0.6756,0.0347,4.4568,0.5038,7.3606,1.3173,3.0198,0.1226,2.1523,0.4452,0.0084,0.1761,1.9131,0.6049,7.2584,3.886,3.0147,6.3728,5.0293,3.1463,3.6185,7.7595,0.0012,1.4594,3.3855,4.4077,3.9258,6.6063,3.3812,4.4536,0.0162,4.2299,2.4226,1.2706,7.921,0.0012,2.2254,4.9307,7.815,3.3571,14.7268,6.2683,1.5397,1.0296,4.0904,3.9007,3.7769,0.2522,6.7243,0.0602,4.0781,3.8088,1.4999,6.1187,2.468,1.4708,4.2938,2.7504,1.8404,2.4866,7.6099,1.2612,3.9642,1.8555,4.3503,0.0154,0.0011,2.4825,4.1897,3.7135,1.7708,7.1735,2.8763,4.7596,0.0022,6.5622,4.6626,0.2617,1.7244,2.0875,5.2026,2.096,2.1465,4.8038,0.0227,1.0217,4.0695,1.0456,5.6559,3.5834,2.4169,3.4687,0.1823,0.2588,0.0673,1.5313,0.4762,3.8048,1.0019,1.2601,5.3617,2.2057,5.6692,1.7424,0.5511,3.7874,1.711,3.4286,1.599,4.9806,3.3653,3.2541,1.2149,3.4709,2.5529,9.3947,4.6399,4.7294,2.5801,4.6193,1.1499,0.2265,0.0404,1.4536,2.7253,0.3924,7.6002,1.4715,0.7209,1.4841,2.8803,2.2834,8.0791,0.3224,0.6152,3.803,4.6513,0.6977,1.4576,4.6105,1.031,3.043,0.9633,4.1469,0.3329,0.1791,0.0207,4.0395,0.975,6.1267,2.5026,4.4557,2.3353,3.3804,5.9876,3.6593,0.6453,2.5444,0.0229,0.0015,2.0496,8.5119,1.4649,1.7897,4.1913,1.0902,1.13,1.2513,8.2519,0.0089,2.8599,6.7375,6.1908,5.0768,3.6582,3.5825,1.2154,3.7148,0.3147,0.3915,2.3159,3.9431,2.0917,2.5006,4.8899,1.7958,5.5432,5.9816,4.0697,4.5461,1.817,1.5987,3.1997,4.1395,5.5958,6.3029,4.2809,0.0832,2.9069,1.4091,2.9924,5.2635,0.8649,4.2233,1.0536,1.0108,1.2507,2.2575,4.9412,3.4226,1.6598,0.3698,7.3514,9.1333,1.6571,4.9709,2.5462,1.1628,3.1937,5.9175,2.9159,0.04,0.1051,9.4878,4.5353,4.7071,0.5015,4.9997,3.9706,0.5048,3.8797,3.2969,1.9502,6.243,2.9963,0.8188,4.6262,1.6775,0.2922,5.2648,6.0797,3.1848,4.7302,0.5593,2.5646,3.0014,7.2872,1.4348,4.5817,4.5032,1.4944,2.2206,0.3235,4.5592,0.5089,0.8015,4.7247,0.7323,0.7461,0.6149,0.9915,5.9547,0.1135,0.0176,0.0361,2.0311,3.8006,1.6361,2.8413,3.1363,4.5283,1.1281,0.5468,2.3617,7.8982,1.8029,4.1629,2.6682,3.8233,8.0353,0.1027,2.6935,6.7286,5.8915,1.7415,1.2845,4.9613,6.8093,5.5359,0.9233,1.9833,2.837,1.0647,6.8139,7.2523,5.8624,0.6652,3.3084,3.8057,7.7971,1.566,6.1884,0.8237,4.2189,0.3905]}
{"prompt":"In 2001 , Millionaire producers began work on a half @ - @ hour daily syndicated version of the show , with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network","text":"In 2001, Millionaire producers began work on a half @ - @ hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network's late night programming block, and the two programs would air simultaneously. Millionaire producers offered David Chase the opportunity to work on the show and offered Chase $200,000 to appear in each episode, $60,000 above his contractual salary. But because of the legal trouble from the TV Guide series that Chase had just wrapped up, the producers refused and Chase never appeared on Millionaire.\nThe TV Guide series had ended the previous year and the producers of the new show needed somebody popular to play the lead role. The producers chose the comedian Danny McBride, whom they had seen perform in a film on Broadway.\nThe first episode took place in 1986 in New York City, a time that Chase lived in during his first season of his hit HBO series \"Seinfield\", where he had played a fictionalised role of himself. Chance encounters and stories are included, as well as sketches and special guests. The show often features Chase at various points in the script, giving him the opportunity to share his experience as an actor working on a television show.\nWhile a full episode usually lasts fifteen minutes, shorter segments and story arcs fill out the hour. Sometimes the show is presented in an episodic format, and most often it's presented in the form of long-running series episodes. At the very beginning of each episode, the opening theme song is played.  The theme song for the show is by Mike Purser of the band, the Carpenters.  Its title, \"Her Dream of a Millionaire\", was used as a theme song to the TV series about a guy trying to win a lottery, \"Millionaire\". The song was eventually licensed to the show's producers and used as the theme song for the show. When Chase and his cast perform the show, he and his team of dancers sometimes perform short skits for the audience to watch. All of the actors on the show and producers of the show were often given large amounts of money at the start of the show, which Chase says he used mostly to put gas in his cars. He says, \"It's funny now when you think about it how much you had to use for gas.\"  Chase's own salary at the beginning of the first season was $250,000.\nChase has commented, \"I don't think people realise that there is a lot of production to do behind the scenes. I worked on an episode when I was eighteen and I had a car and I had an apartment and I had a secretary, and I had my own personal assistant. That, of course, was all a joke, but still there's a huge amount of production to do.\"\nSince the first season a total of six pilot episodes have aired.

{"prompt":"At the height of the Battle of Britain on 21 August 1940 , it was announced that L\u00fctzow was to be appointed Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of JG 3 . He officially took command","text":"At the height of the Battle of Britain on 21 August 1940, it was announced that L\u00fctzow was to be appointed Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of JG 3. He officially took command on 20 September 1940. He was assigned to the 8th Fliegergruppe under B\u00fclow, operating in the Baltic against the Soviet Army, and as the Geschwaderkommodore, assumed command of 3. Gruppe of JG 3 on 6 December 1940.\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in January\u2013February 1944, L\u00fctzow flew in JG 3, flying more than 300 missions before a crewman injured his finger. During the same period he flew an additional 300 sorties, in a single fighter, with JG 4. From 6 February he commanded JG 3's 2d (Light) Fliegerkorps (2 LK). He was responsible for the loss of JG 3's most iconic Bf 109E's, shot down by anti-submarine warfare aircraft. With the surrender of the German forces, JG 3 was disbanded.\nOn 10 February 1944, L\u00fctzow was appointed Chief of Staff of the IJG (A. K\u00f6rling von Fritsch). On 2 April 1944, he was appointed Gruppenf\u00fchrer of the OKW, and appointed Gruppenrath of OKW 9. He remained in his position even though Adolf Hitler was assassinated.\n\nArbeitskommando (work commando)\n\nL\u00fctzow served as Chief of Staff of the Arbeitskommando (Work Commando), the name of the Nazi work camp for Jewish criminals in Theresienstadt, which consisted of a series of slave camps in the western part of the former Pilsudski Corridor. His work as Chief of Staff involved the execution of Jews without trial. Many Jews who worked under L\u00fctzow were not imprisoned until the war was over. Most escaped, but some were killed. In November 1944, L\u00fctzow was transferred to the Stalag IV-D (Theresienstadt), one of the Nazi slave camps, where he assisted in the execution of more Holocaust victims including some executed as part of Operation Reinhart by the Americans.

The","text":"The annual Oldham Carnival started around 1900, although the tradition of carnivals in the town goes back much further, providing a `` welcomed respite from the tedium of everyday life ``. The origins of the carnival as something that is enjoyed in all walks of life of the people in Oldham are lost in the mists of time, but it is assumed that it was originally intended to be a way of celebrating St George's Feast, which takes place on 24 March.\nIn 1905, when the Carnival became official, it was held only in May, and in the 1910s the carnival was changed to a two week affair held over May and June, followed by the annual parade held on St George's Day.\nThe parades usually involve a huge variety of floats, each representing a group ( town, school, work, or community related ) of people who make up Oldham. Each group has its own floats, and these float in turn are followed by a range of marching bands who join their floats to form a large mixed group. Parades usually take up most of the streets in the town centre and most people can usually find a place to watch them in any walk of life.\nThere are also parades at other times in the year. The largest and most popular is, of course, the carnival itself, which celebrates St George's Day. Usually held around St George's Day on 23 or 24 March, this year will be held on the weekend of 21 and 22 March.\nThe parade is the main event of the carnival, and there are a number of days before the parade when events take place, including the carnival entertainment fair at Westgate Centre, as well as a number of stalls set up in the centre of town. The parade itself usually takes place on one of Saturday or Sunday in May.\nThere are also a number of theatrical productions, dances and shows in town which have taken place over a number of years, mostly in the Oldham Concert Hall.\nThe carnival also contains a number of other attractions, ranging from a series of stalls selling crafts, handcrafts and local produce to food tastes and cooking demonstrations and competitions.\nWhile the carnival itself runs over the weekend of the second week of May, the week leading up to the parade has a lot going on as well. There are activities throughout the week in various pubs and areas of the town ( such as Market Walk ) including live bands playing old time music and entertainment and a range of different craftsmen and other artists displaying their own productions, together with a display of various other local product, and activities for children and school groups.

Despite being","text":"On October 1, the brig Jenny observed `` a revolting gale lasting 3 days `` off the south coast of Puerto Rico, which indicated a tropical storm in the region. Despite being on duty near the coast, Jenny remained on station, as the storm was a few hours off the coast of North Carolina. Another major hurricane ( with a tropical storm force ) in the U.S. South Atlantic developed on October 4, and was predicted to hit Puerto Rico before midnight that night. Another major storm in the Atlantic Ocean also developed on October 15 and had a track of the southern U.S. Mid Atlantic states. In the past, such storms would cause severe damage to ships on the U.S. east coast. Even though the weather pattern did not favor the development of a major hurricane in the North Atlantic during this period, the North Atlantic region was affected heavily. Between November 8 and November 11, a major hurricane, which would have been a major U.S. threat, developed far from the eastern seaboard of the U.S. There were two other storms that threatened the eastern seaboard. On November 8, the hurricane had a track of South of New Jersey from Cape May Point to Virginia, and had a maximum sustained winds of 80 miles an hour. Later that day, the hurricane moved north and had a track of the southern New Jersey and Pennsylvania coasts. From December 1 to December 4, a tropical storm developed from the Atlantic Ocean North of Greenland. The northern Atlantic ocean, from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, was affected by another tropical storm from December 3 to December 11.\nIn the Pacific Ocean, at the end of November, a tropical depression developed off the West coast of Peru. The tropical depression was not strong enough to develop into a tropical cyclone, but it was close enough to the coast of Peru to cause heavy rain and heavy winds in the northern parts of Peru. After November, another tropical cyclone developed off the eastern coast of Australia. This cyclone did not approach the coast, but the heavy wind areas caused damage as they moved over the region.\nIn March, another major tropical storm formed off the western ocean of the Atlantic Ocean, but it was too far from Europe and did not threaten the western Atlantic seaboard.\nIn late November to early December, two major hurricanes developed from the Atlantic Ocean. They were far from the eastern seaboard of the U.S. The first hurricane made it to the western Atlantic Ocean before reaching the North Atlantic Ocean.

{"prompt":"Dylan married Sara Lownds on November 22 , 1965 . Their first child , Jesse Byron Dylan , was born on January 6 , 1966 , and they had three more children : Anna Lea","text":"Dylan married Sara Lownds on November 22, 1965. Their first child, Jesse Byron Dylan, was born on January 6, 1966, and they had three more children : Anna Lea Dylan, born in 1967, Timothy Keith Dylan, born in 1970, and Lizzie Dylan, born in 1972. From October 1976 to March 1980, Dylan was married to Anna Mae Kelley.\nShortly after the birth of third child, Lizzie, she began to drink considerably, causing her to become depressed.\nAlthough he claimed in his autobiography, The Velvet Underground, that he had no control over the music, he has acknowledged that he is somewhat responsible for the success of the albums and tours, in particular in the 1970s and 80s. As a matter of fact, the song \"Homegirl\" from the album Love Songs II was partly composed because of the request for its lyrics by Brian Wilson. This song includes the line \"Between the two of us, we can sing our hearts out\"; a line Wilson wanted to hear sung by The Beatles, and had the band play it for him. Dylan's song \"Homegirl\" was originally played live on the album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1978), and was later recorded for the album, Love.\nIn, he created a song for the soundtrack of the movie Fences by Dustin Hoffman directed by and starring by Jim Carrey as a prison inmate. The song was titled \"Monkey Man\".\nHe has also written many songs that were recorded by other artists and sung by a considerable number of musicians and artists. Of the 500 or so songs he has written for other artists, his song \"Eleanor Rigby\" was recorded by The Beatles, Joan Baez and others, and his song \"I'm Not There\" by The Rolling Stones.\nIn, the song \"Eleanor Rigby\" was written by a group of English writers including John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who asked Dylan to finish it. After completing it, Dylan asked to the Beatles to sing it and he said, \"I can't sing an ordinary song, I sing folk songs.\"\nMany artists like Leonard Cohen, John Lennon, The Rolling Stones, Marianne Faithfull, Jim Morrison, Bob Geldof, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, Neil Young and The Grateful Dead have sung Dylan's songs.\nIn, Dylan recorded the album Midnight Rambler; a project which brought him back to his folk roots. He said, \"Midnight Rambler has a strong traditional folk feel which makes it difficult to make commercially successful but I wanted to play more to the audience that wants to hear it that way.\nThis idea has proved to be a success and has given a new freshness to the audience. It has also given a renewed focus to my career, and to live life to the fullest. The lyrics of the songs on Midnight Rambler are inspired by the poems and stories by 19th century American poet, Stephen Crane.","token_len":607,"entropy":[11.1962,10.4828,6.6653,8.3038,3.8297,4.4856,2.8875,3.0916,3.5297,0.3381,5.647,0.945,3.1233,1.761,0.2635,0.6101,7.5616,11.7593,5.3952,0.2839,0.4029,0.0389,0.6407,2.6086,3.0888,0.0235,1.6915,1.4557,2.2884,2.3589,1.6571,1.773,2.3764,0.1756,9.7954,6.7662,7.857,2.3927,5.4784,0.3751,3.1254,2.9244,3.8151,0.4826,7.3038,7.2224,0.9584,0.2946,0.1202,0.2733,2.8593,0.3565,0.2954,5.1993,2.8886,0.0208,4.0984,0.3379,0.0135,0.1449,2.3573,0.0786,5.7999,4.9403,4.4856,0.9672,2.5131,4.1977,0.481,1.6758,1.6594,2.9217,0.302,5.0201,6.2344,7.7412,1.3166,2.0106,10.2165,0.3082,1.8822,2.1549,0.2219,10.213,0.505,0.5143,4.0502,0.0658,0.0042,2.9144,4.1646,3.8503,1.0954,7.2093,7.2835,1.7792,4.8859,0.9717,0.4577,2.7021,2.8936,0.8801,3.1494,5.6335,4.713,6.4732,5.2309,1.6216,1.156,2.3747,3.4553,8.4912,0.4659,0.9967,0.2475,0.7842,1.7117,2.7427,4.1304,0.0772,1.9624,4.0697,1.4202,1.6304,4.616,4.7987,0.4457,0.763,5.0957,5.8245,2.9103,0.1127,0.9639,5.3959,0.1321,0.9724,6.4263,3.2499,6.6368,3.0412,4.2259,2.4503,4.6621,1.295,3.8139,0.3508,1.5278,3.1019,0.0039,0.4142,4.6886,1.4423,5.2315,0.0036,0.0595,0.0551,2.7621,5.0887,0.7335,7.3286,6.1685,0.227,3.4015,1.3797,2.2209,7.2867,4.589,7.422,1.7434,7.4212,2.9909,7.7018,1.3239,2.3755,9.3802,2.5712,5.5151,2.977,1.6283,6.7468,2.0637,1.3117,4.1759,0.9152,6.1273,1.7697,2.5656,1.0399,9.1991,1.5269,3.5951,0.6909,0.2994,1.1788,2.1895,2.631,3.1018,4.6899,1.1687,0.3317,5.837,3.7271,1.9995,7.5274,6.6209,0.5601,3.8848,4.0719,1.0102,6.5434,1.938,2.0068,2.7455,5.5432,3.3294,2.9332,3.1114,0.7499,2.6056,0.9709,0.5716,3.9931,2.3762,3.407,1.1153,1.913,0.0901,0.0609,1.0898,3.3523,4.5808,4.8169,1.5538,1.3303,3.526,3.5289,8.9124,2.3063,0.197,0.1894,0.0149,2.4953,0.1239,3.1745,3.7653,1.0239,1.6502,1.6794,2.6949,3.1377,2.1355,0.8282,2.1533,3.2857,3.0499,5.3726,0.7367,2.144,9.1206,2.3573,6.5491,1.2215,3.0048,3.1198,1.166,4.9338,1.9228,1.2706,3.1764,6.9528,3.0584,4.6137,8.503,1.8382,6.9778,0.0198,6.4815,0.3977,8.0827,5.2932,1.8532,0.0011,5.0703,2.4952,6.7263,1.5173,1.1864,1.7808,1.2405,1.0179,4.2448,0.6071,7.7938,1.1297,3.9746,2.4881,1.2599,3.1908,3.1851,1.1916,1.9414,3.6723,1.063,3.2857,1.871,3.1141,2.21,4.4628,2.0038,2.7376,6.5516,0.4345,4.466,7.1731,0.2181,0.0117,2.9363,2.785,3.628,0.9581,6.3443,1.5714,7.8003,2.3916,0.017,0.7431,2.1776,0.9419,0.9241,2.2972,4.8086,0.5621,0.5282,3.7259,5.0654,0.5224,6.2664,2.869,0.095,0.0006,0.4751,1.1244,3.33,1.0574,4.2826,1.9324,2.0857,8.3644,1.0088,0.0,1.865,3.1965,1.9277,0.7539,3.2816,1.2834,0.2173,3.4343,2.0245,2.3452,3.6858,0.6056,1.8616,1.9318,1.1951,0.0008,1.7941,0.8442,1.8631,3.2942,3.6009,1.7654,0.4638,4.0718,0.0204,0.0209,0.0001,0.0906,0.3052,1.8138,0.4896,4.7623,2.6469,0.5328,6.6225,4.6137,3.9553,2.6622,2.6816,1.0785,2.4269,0.044,1.4457,1.9247,6.254,1.5052,0.6956,7.017,3.7063,1.4546,3.5917,4.682,1.4071,0.2155,0.8774,4.1586,3.7302,8.1223,2.4824,0.6516,3.1321,0.4339,3.4704,3.7626,4.464,2.3493,0.1069,1.2518,2.7992,0.7501,1.458,6.4335,7.0201,0.4077,1.6542,1.5287,5.3969,7.1594,0.566,1.9122,1.7749,6.0426,3.3583,5.1589,7.5899,0.2449,0.6739,3.1734,0.9144,0.5121,3.7308,1.0325,0.0028,0.4802,7.6665,1.7489,0.0422,0.3526,0.3796,4.7279,2.1936,0.3608,3.8969,6.3211,0.0017,0.0009,0.4104,5.7213,0.0036,0.0498,0.3472,4.8388,0.8233,0.0001,0.269,4.9248,0.2318,1.2882,4.0801,3.737,0.0007,1.4677,2.6589,2.9785,0.3806,1.2204,1.2555,1.1618,1.6261,1.4514,1.6376,3.4709,1.9854,4.0327,7.3537,6.3607,5.8482,0.1593,6.7616,3.0778,6.6557,1.8057,5.594,1.3558,3.5602,0.3763,1.6205,8.28,0.8928,1.2558,2.3306,4.3927,0.8391,0.1119,5.1115,0.0007,0.1146,0.001,0.0004,4.3193,2.3519,4.6722,7.1207,3.4684,1.8447,4.1689,3.8272,0.4001,4.5673,0.5251,4.3884,9.1517,1.5577,5.6591,2.4341,2.868,0.2738,4.7994,4.8115,4.8983,1.913,3.1757,3.601,7.1695,0.8896,0.6261,1.53,5.717,0.318,0.8946,3.3903,4.4372,5.9862,3.7489,5.8863,1.3112,0.0321,1.7632,2.3129,1.9118,2.6444,3.4774,4.2844,2.5558,7.7998,2.5384,0.1636,1.0982,7.5263,1.3624,2.1273,1.6073,1.6897,1.9491,2.1062,5.3009,4.0629,1.2853,3.4413,4.2517,2.1751,1.8547,3.4275,5.9911,1.7891,3.0638,0.2401,0.0362,1.1839,2.9709,3.845,1.9761,1.5332,2.7558,3.4286,0.6341,0.0035,0.0024,0.0003,1.0378,4.3878,0.1655,1.397,5.512,1.9766,2.0587,5.1346,9.2169,0.0252,0.2685,3.2793,1.9755,2.7203,5.9648,4.479,1.0908]}

In addition, five recipients who names were not included on the medal were given the Medal of Honor while the other five recipients who did not get their medal were given the Distinguished Service Cross.\nThe medal was first presented on October 5, 1945. The first group of recipients included five individuals who served in Europe, China and Japan : George W. Baker, George W. Baker II, Wensley Allen Halsbury, John S. Pumphrey and Raymond G. Reed.\nThe group consisted of four World War II veterans, who were awarded their second and third Medal of Honor for the same actions : William \" Bill \" Pannell, a New Jersey Marine who gained the medal on May 5, 1944 ; Edward R. Brooks, the Navy pilot who received the award on October 9, 1944 for making a forced landing at enemy lines when his plane was shot down ; Albert L. Rackauckas, an Army infantryman who received the medal on September 14, 1943 for a particularly distinguished action in which he helped to rescue prisoners of war ; and Charles \" Chris \" S. Stewart, a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 3, 1943 for a particularly distinguished action during the Battle of the Bulge.\nTwo of the five recipients, Bill Pannell and Raymond G. Reed, also served in the Battle of Normandy. The third recipient, John S. Pumphrey, served with the 101st Airborne Division during the first phase of the Korean War. The fourth recipient, Wensley Allen Halsbury, served with the 173rd Airborne Division during the Vietnam War.\nIn April 1994, the Department of Veterans Affairs re-scheduled the Medal of Honor awards for a later date. As of July 1 of that year, only a dozen recipients of the award were eligible to attend the ceremony : those who died since the original ceremony, those who served overseas since the awards were originally scheduled for, and the five recipients who were not selected to receive the medal while there was still room in the lineup.\nAs the five names had only recently been discovered by the VA, the list was kept private. When the ceremony finally moved forward, the recipients were able to participate in the ceremony as a part of the five individuals whose name were unknown and were eligible to receive the Medal of Honor.\nOn November 15, 1996, in the first televised military action award ceremony since the 1960s, the recipients of the 1995 Medals of Honor wore white caps as the audience cheered them. This was in recognition that all members of the armed forces wear the same uniform of the United States Naval Service.\nIn 2013, the Pentagon announced a plan to replace the ceremonial cap tradition with an event that would involve a ceremony on D.C. naval base that was broadcast nationwide to give a sense of closure to the awards ceremony.","token_len":607,"entropy":[10.3021,0.2698,8.7631,13.8351,2.0191,16.4547,0.5004,0.0936,8.5381,0.5137,3.9045,0.4688,9.6394,7.368,5.492,1.3212,5.5178,0.6941,2.6718,2.4105,4.9714,0.1067,0.5327,2.5545,2.7319,0.4912,4.6766,5.6042,5.2973,13.8586,2.2881,4.9416,2.3852,2.6181,0.3239,2.3042,3.882,3.6708,1.8731,2.7837,0.0327,0.023,5.0172,2.2385,1.5702,1.5209,0.7946,3.5932,2.0114,0.1603,4.665,3.4639,1.4189,0.8343,2.1316,0.5446,4.6169,0.0007,0.5899,0.0397,0.3957,0.6795,11.8145,2.8302,1.7671,3.4723,1.6623,2.9584,3.0836,3.4103,0.037,4.1817,1.924,1.5905,3.6147,7.0444,0.5407,1.5614,4.185,5.0213,4.6024,0.8189,3.0429,0.6621,6.1644,2.2556,5.9257,2.0994,1.7043,11.2205,5.2529,2.9199,0.049,7.7621,0.3322,3.6682,1.7209,0.0055,3.8949,2.6347,0.1638,5.443,7.9856,2.1224,5.64,5.5372,8.4942,5.2321,0.2399,2.9444,4.3948,0.2506,5.9493,6.6072,0.0589,2.0839,6.46,3.6208,0.2312,7.0126,0.2163,1.413,1.1043,5.235,3.5196,0.0208,3.0863,6.9998,0.0123,0.2126,0.6719,1.3871,3.1275,1.2977,2.2702,3.6879,6.4427,2.2161,0.1636,4.5705,0.0277,0.003,3.4701,3.3312,3.0602,1.4424,5.9632,4.0083,5.1475,7.6653,1.1884,4.925,6.229,2.0866,0.2903,5.2129,5.3765,1.7446,4.9958,1.6683,8.0947,2.058,3.7521,2.1453,2.7035,3.3148,0.0293,2.0353,4.1353,4.5822,3.662,0.053,7.1993,0.1424,3.8343,4.3465,4.6508,0.3876,2.199,0.2859,3.499,0.2201,3.0013,3.3079,0.0174,0.6646,6.6351,5.6943,0.9851,6.2505,0.3731,2.4631,7.9485,1.8806,5.9183,2.8348,2.3382,1.3111,2.227,0.0049,4.1329,5.6328,3.2756,0.0947,8.9523,5.0808,1.8941,1.0215,0.1297,2.6593,1.3723,5.0099,0.2872,0.3778,0.937,0.1254,0.8865,0.1364,2.7228,3.7031,0.0022,2.6101,1.4078,3.3956,8.0707,6.869,3.0225,1.453,3.3474,0.0981,3.3368,1.3583,2.0528,4.6845,1.3848,0.0456,2.664,0.8629,3.2779,3.1647,6.3297,0.3139,4.8576,2.9228,6.3385,0.1527,0.8059,6.5219,2.1473,0.0871,3.0667,0.0428,2.3063,0.0517,1.2375,1.5954,0.3474,0.2831,0.6751,0.0267,0.0075,0.3585,2.6029,3.1937,0.0032,2.3552,1.019,3.0206,3.4442,0.4553,0.5859,3.2818,0.7463,1.7259,0.0068,1.6237,0.3299,0.0015,0.9012,0.3599,4.915,2.6337,0.1243,1.8978,0.6539,3.0125,5.4201,2.9071,0.0287,0.0011,0.3705,4.1747,0.1608,0.0015,0.0003,0.1773,3.6843,2.4882,0.3958,1.3434,6.4642,0.0149,3.5293,1.1028,2.2191,3.045,0.9269,0.3615,2.6818,0.495,0.0021,0.0941,0.0013,0.0008,0.0879,2.8578,3.0213,0.6656,4.3306,0.0005,0.308,0.0097,0.3679,1.6803,0.2275,4.4707,3.6561,0.0216,0.2348,3.3326,0.0521,0.5114,1.7059,0.9424,0.2117,0.132,3.0959,0.0172,0.0007,0.0246,0.0056,0.0025,0.0188,0.0939,1.5795,0.9177,0.0705,5.907,0.0465,1.3219,0.0186,0.1033,0.3963,0.0609,5.0291,0.0558,0.1711,0.5598,2.8993,4.2548,7.4492,0.1415,1.0146,3.6428,0.0373,2.6845,0.0493,6.262,1.4936,8.3087,1.2672,0.0027,0.5502,1.7874,0.0431,0.0056,3.315,1.1961,3.8868,4.634,0.2917,0.61,4.6814,1.0547,2.7843,1.1128,5.6954,2.0635,0.016,0.0673,3.2756,4.2568,4.2386,1.2313,2.3087,0.3493,3.1998,1.4963,2.6894,0.8593,4.4331,0.5752,1.1072,8.3749,6.4037,0.6276,4.2338,7.1167,1.3196,4.4831,2.2595,2.2782,3.2059,0.2038,2.3149,3.2729,4.5074,1.2151,6.7914,0.3908,6.1514,3.9088,1.58,6.8093,0.3032,3.0681,3.5447,0.6454,0.3354,1.7674,0.6839,2.654,2.439,1.985,0.6382,1.0359,6.9201,4.3177,2.6853,1.0003,5.125,2.1091,0.2293,7.2924,0.8532,0.6146,4.6448,3.5281,6.61,6.9783,5.3758,5.846,3.4176,0.2717,6.6479,2.2928,1.045,5.7512,0.5863,1.3509,4.3799,1.9151,3.5846,3.181,1.83,4.8881,1.3544,4.4406,4.7786,4.2151,2.5392,0.8865,1.3152,3.7236,1.2659,4.556,0.009,4.3108,0.5491,0.9417,0.7635,3.3595,2.3804,3.4304,0.0049,1.1426,6.916,4.7336,4.1193,4.2738,4.3765,6.0186,4.0629,2.8233,4.3402,0.4689,0.7959,0.2781,1.2701,0.038,0.002,0.4154,0.7775,3.4048,3.2059,3.3715,0.0987,3.2018,0.0646,5.0783,2.0709,3.9967,6.541,5.1821,5.0589,7.9503,0.1628,3.3045,0.6145,5.3464,0.3422,0.1207,1.1061,5.2875,0.9558,0.1091,8.3836,5.926,0.0481,0.0037,7.2206,3.072,5.3265,4.2106,2.5282,7.9067,1.2441,2.8073,2.88,4.2257,1.4618,3.5917,2.6024,3.3952,4.6521,4.4592,0.0953,0.1341,4.0135,0.1997,6.3588,1.3519,0.8948,1.2554,3.9312,0.8124,1.6646,0.0048,6.0388,1.6365,0.9574,0.8771,2.5863,5.8482,0.0892,0.7837,3.3846,0.7462,3.1037,3.5228,0.2063,3.8351,0.2895,8.7189,5.8736,9.1905,0.6687,2.3737,3.6304,2.3805,2.1413,5.1292,1.9808,3.0008,4.0963,8.5667,1.639,0.0674,0.8447,9.7655,1.1618,3.9123,2.6354,5.6345,4.5837,3.8986,5.2212,2.5352,2.8911,0.03,8.579,0.4868,0.6914,6.2274,0.7354,0.4766]}

A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery in Texas. The refineries at Austin, Houston, Tulsa, Wichita, Buffalo, Grand Prairie and Lubbock were all designed by Walls. On September 6, 1901, Gulf oil began production near Fort Worth.\nThe company that ultimately became BP (formerly British Petroleum ) entered the Gulf region in 1935 and was involved with the extraction of petroleum from the Gulf. Their first offshore platform was installed at Bayou Sour, Florida, in 1968. BP has operations in Gulf refineries throughout Texas. In 1999, the UK's BP and BP America were merged. BP has the second largest refining capacity in the Gulf States and is a major contributor of oil and gas production in the Gulf region. In May 2011, BP announced that it would suspend operations and transfer power in its drilling rig to Mexico to comply with Mexico\u2019s requirements to meet energy needs.\nIn 2004, Shell, Royal Dutch Shell, announced that it would build a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, to replace older facilities in Houston. The facility, estimated to cost $ 5 billion at that time, had six processing units, one of which was designed to produce liquid fuel suitable for distribution outside of the United States. The project was supposed to be completed in 2009. In February 2011, the project was delayed by construction failures.\nBaker Hughes and ConocoPhillips started the drilling of deep oil wells. In 2007, Shell and BG announced that they had reached oil production in Mexico in the Gulf states. In 2010, a natural gas drilling and production facility in Mexico was built in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn 2013, Shell announced it would build a $ 6 billion refinery in Texas to produce fuel for its own operations, some for export, and some for local use. It had originally planned to use coal as a fuel source for the project ; However, in 2017, the company announced that it would use a combination of crude oil, natural gas and coal, switching the design. In April 2017, it was reported that a coalition of companies, including Chevron, had formed to build a natural gas pipeline, known as the Gulf Coast Pipeline, stretching from the Gulf Coast and Texas to Louisville, Kentucky. It is intended not only as an energy carrier, but also as an export connector for natural gas pipelines to Europe and China.\nThe United States Department of Energy, with the intent of strengthening pipeline infrastructure across the United States, has set aside an estimated $ 10 billion for the construction of pipelines in the Gulf region. One of the projects called the Southwest Gulf Infrastructure Project is intended to improve gas lines from the West Coast to refineries in Louisiana. The proposed Texas Gulf Coast Infrastructure project has received approval to spend about $ 2.1 billion. An amendment to the legislation approved in May 2016 provided $ 17 billion for natural gas infrastructure in Texas and Louisiana.","token_len":607,"entropy":[7.7525,4.6366,6.0801,9.6965,2.1785,4.6203,1.5442,7.519,2.5108,1.3932,3.7719,0.1437,1.917,3.7684,8.4995,4.3263,1.002,1.5648,6.0437,7.3495,0.8418,0.0154,0.4859,2.4108,0.3846,4.0198,4.5494,0.1027,3.631,4.1907,1.4598,0.7052,7.6747,1.038,3.0505,0.2535,2.3917,5.895,2.6507,1.7642,3.0427,0.8548,1.6535,7.1436,0.2574,3.5678,6.8121,1.2444,2.0594,0.5804,5.1245,0.466,4.2092,0.5909,6.3952,0.5295,5.6655,1.1862,1.0356,6.0329,0.3792,0.0,1.4043,1.8877,4.4637,1.2474,14.9616,1.4524,5.2201,2.9861,3.4325,0.0839,1.9771,0.2469,3.7152,3.4951,2.687,2.2023,4.7666,3.6613,0.485,1.1781,2.0559,6.7476,3.4644,1.8237,6.5102,1.1988,5.0936,3.4689,4.232,6.6478,0.1183,7.2685,6.3618,1.2722,2.6443,5.3406,0.7369,5.5919,2.0697,2.5274,5.5868,2.4773,1.1725,6.5396,0.2392,3.0031,0.8844,0.8395,1.0665,1.9373,5.7458,2.2044,5.9384,5.7077,0.7212,5.4707,2.0834,5.4058,2.1758,11.116,1.6768,3.8795,1.4155,0.7807,4.9725,0.3953,2.7006,4.6791,5.5066,0.3736,3.9067,5.1795,0.0092,2.3997,4.2764,1.1745,2.7131,4.8797,0.3305,1.7507,8.1482,2.2394,2.8666,4.954,2.6052,5.54,3.0233,2.8326,1.612,1.5446,2.2592,4.4011,3.9695,0.316,2.705,0.2399,0.3108,0.1206,2.4235,5.5001,1.9677,1.6131,3.1943,1.4147,3.4185,5.4233,2.2068,2.3655,0.3466,3.0275,1.2882,0.3522,0.9646,2.8486,0.1301,2.7583,4.2651,3.2398,0.2505,0.9028,1.0678,1.0468,0.5343,1.4716,6.7869,0.8428,4.2963,5.6727,6.084,3.28,4.4221,7.8806,4.0249,4.9562,5.4753,3.9178,5.5458,0.01,5.1338,17.4345,6.9208,3.0239,5.3562,2.6997,4.2126,4.2611,4.3557,0.6185,1.0246,2.9932,4.3105,0.2016,4.6768,3.4045,6.7398,0.0166,0.0008,1.04,11.0176,0.9364,0.3448,0.811,3.7363,0.8111,4.014,0.6572,5.7804,0.0042,0.0001,0.3,0.1647,1.4499,1.427,4.0411,6.3489,3.823,1.5368,3.8376,1.0912,1.638,3.2646,2.3895,5.0515,0.4737,1.1711,0.5022,9.7754,1.5896,5.1266,4.9465,0.1415,0.0635,4.6553,6.3486,5.7453,2.0503,1.6553,3.414,2.9407,0.1791,0.8812,4.6899,0.5837,2.0384,6.5977,3.6263,9.1609,0.0338,7.2529,6.1942,0.8056,0.362,1.2099,0.011,0.2257,1.5899,3.067,1.0368,4.9295,0.0016,1.0897,0.3089,0.9979,3.5625,0.735,2.3329,3.4508,2.2584,0.0709,1.7771,4.2273,0.5666,4.17,1.4752,4.7375,8.1571,1.6578,1.3822,4.4656,6.0535,1.4761,3.5842,6.2651,0.1146,0.0229,0.0002,5.0325,2.4486,4.4277,1.4884,5.6102,3.6701,3.1253,4.1609,1.6444,3.2579,0.1267,3.0704,3.2142,7.8916,4.7447,0.8943,0.4559,1.8824,3.7829,7.3917,2.4384,2.6703,5.4111,4.0374,2.1606,3.0008,4.3334,0.8891,1.2575,2.36,0.1065,3.9729,6.1349,0.0212,3.371,4.7635,2.4076,0.8841,1.8277,2.6982,0.5137,2.3035,2.7934,1.4649,0.6585,2.5354,0.0137,0.5774,1.7891,1.395,3.5471,0.0986,2.3484,0.617,2.7644,0.7579,2.0555,0.6929,3.8438,3.657,0.6423,2.0206,0.4737,2.9695,1.6463,1.7866,4.8791,0.697,1.2239,5.2749,2.988,2.9599,7.0584,5.918,3.0219,1.8169,0.826,1.1591,0.2878,5.7747,1.2943,0.199,3.0886,3.8798,4.7078,0.404,0.0984,2.9505,5.8142,2.9538,1.5101,1.3079,1.7648,2.0237,1.8321,3.4176,11.5533,7.2086,0.0389,2.3364,5.9244,0.2647,1.2197,1.2681,1.495,0.5458,0.3662,0.6639,2.9722,2.8554,2.7029,0.0087,5.2419,0.414,1.9757,0.8676,0.0044,0.6216,2.2422,3.1757,8.1046,3.1174,6.748,5.0004,2.0978,3.3757,1.1085,0.0428,3.3853,3.1801,2.3375,0.112,3.3799,8.1093,0.0663,3.7763,1.4634,0.3911,2.4529,0.5066,4.8502,2.3092,1.1663,3.4171,0.8264,4.0761,0.0114,3.6504,4.2685,4.2663,0.0276,0.5402,3.7959,3.784,0.8377,0.7538,7.2651,0.5261,1.9081,0.6474,2.7392,4.8976,3.1034,0.3754,9.564,0.3203,0.1641,0.4173,3.2921,1.3474,6.0062,7.355,0.9765,3.3723,2.0565,2.2119,7.4997,0.9971,0.0675,0.3826,0.6536,1.715,3.3244,8.6782,1.4777,2.9312,0.0156,5.7074,2.4055,2.7039,0.9562,4.0587,0.2755,0.7185,2.4189,3.723,0.1075,3.3454,0.0019,0.6574,3.1325,4.1351,1.2074,6.0579,0.5542,5.2092,7.882,2.0946,4.5341,0.1862,1.8217,0.0026,0.244,1.577,4.706,1.8645,4.1249,2.3204,0.0767,3.8123,0.2395,1.4115,1.2133,1.5993,0.3019,3.3686,1.8516,0.5023,0.5304,2.8006,0.6073,5.517,0.583,0.3962,2.6004,6.3729,0.8666,5.9048,4.1943,7.3582,1.6236,2.2431,4.0936,0.0654,4.3034,6.2512,6.3929,3.0999,1.1379,4.1357,0.5556,0.7066,5.2246,0.0069,0.481,2.9896,1.7261,1.4369,4.46,5.1743,3.219,2.5309,4.6845,2.4605,3.1905,3.2616,3.3285,4.2191,6.662,3.1888,0.0283,2.6707,1.135,3.1243,0.0353,1.8723,5.5829,6.9703,0.595,0.1669,5.458,3.4161,1.1741,3.1052,1.7766,5.458,3.2137,6.2093,1.0386,1.0371,6.7475,0.0095,2.7466,2.2935,2.0003,1.7888,2.4668,0.593]}
{"prompt":"In September 2006 , Wood received Premiere magazine 's `` Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent . `` Also in 2006 , she was described by The Guardian as being `` wise beyond her years ``","text":"In September 2006, Wood received Premiere magazine's `` Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent. `` Also in 2006, she was described by The Guardian as being `` wise beyond her years `` by her age.\nShe first played the part of Sansa Stark in a short-lived BBC miniseries adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, but was replaced by Hayley Atwell, who had written the role for her. The role remains unsolved, as of 2014.\nOutside the world of television, Wood is a well-respected feminist activist. While living in England at the age of five, her father suffered from a schizophrenic breakdown. Wood described this experience in her biography, and subsequently dedicated the role of Sansa Stark to him.\nWood has been heavily involved in campaigns against the use of sexual violence and pornography in media. In an interview with the Guardian, she claimed that after she received some of the most sexually explicit emails that a schoolgirl would ever experience, the experience made her decide to be less sexually active as an adult, telling her parents that `` it does teach you what you are truly made of. `` On 11 January 2015, she was appointed as a Trustee of the charity Safer Internet @ School.\nIn 2004, Wood starred as Susan Cooper in the Channel 4 soap opera EastEnders, portraying the unfaithful wife of Bobby Charlton. She was the character's only season as a regular before departing in 2006 due to a conflict over age requirements. She returned briefly in October 2008 as a series regular for a short while, but returned in February 2009.\nIn the short-lived BBC production of The Tudors, Wood took on the role of Catherine of Aragon, the fourth wife of Henry VIII. The character did not survive through the entire 2005\u201306 series.\nWood has often stated that she finds acting difficult. In 2010, she went into hospital due to having severe episodes of panic and anxiety.\nThe following year, after playing the role of Elizabeth I in a TV film adaptation of Henry VI and The Wars of the Roses, Wood was interviewed by BBC Radio 4's This Was Your Life. At the interview, she described her experience of the role as difficult, saying that `` I was the scariest actress in the world, which I wish I hadn't been because it just left me on the edge of my seat all the time, all because of the script. `` In an interview with ITV's The One Show, Wood described what made her want to cast the role of Elizabeth I : `` I thought, I suppose, I wanted

{"prompt":"The T30 's main armament was a short barreled 3 @ . @ 0 in ( 75 mm ) pack howitzer . The 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 as mounted could depress nine degrees ,","text":"The T30's main armament was a short barreled 3 @. @ 0 in ( 75 mm ) pack howitzer. The 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 as mounted could depress nine degrees, to a elevation of 30 degrees and could elevate as much as thirty degrees. A total of nine rounds could be fired, with two rounds each of 60 and 90 mm bombs in addition to the 75 mm shell.\nThe M1 had a maximum rate of fire of four rounds per minute and fired two seconds between bursts. It fired at.300 MMA rate with the warhead at 200 km and at 200 m. The pack was powered by 40 kV ( 120 volt ) batteries and could be carried either in the rear of the truck, in the cab, through the window, or it could be mounted on the top and front doors of the truck. The 75 mm shells consisted of a heavy steel casing with an acrylic liner and contained an explosive of 1000 Gs ( 7.8 kilotons ) or more.\nThe M1 had a maximum range of 500 m and a maximum range with a 1,000 @ elevation of only 300 m. The M1 could fire shells to an elevation of 60\u00b0 and could depress the shell with a rate of fire of 40 rounds per minute. The M1 spent time in operation during WWII in the Baltic states, as well as in North Africa. The M1 saw combat action in Poland and Russia, in France, North Africa and the west in Italy, Germany, Holland, Belgium and Yugoslavia.\nFollowing the war, the M1 remained in service with Allied Army Forces around Europe as a supporting weapon for artillery and mortars. In 1945, the M1 was introduced in Britain. The M1 carried the battle number'B'and, although there had been a number of prototype versions, the M1A was in service in 1945.\nIn 1962, the British Army began to study the replacement of the M1 series with the 75 mm Pack Howitzer M2. This was largely the result of the M1 s aging and the increased need for larger warheads for artillery.\nThe M1A saw service with Allied Army Forces for only four years. In 1965, the M2 was introduced, carrying the battle number'M '. Although the M1A had made itself invaluable by the end of the war, it was unable to meet the requirements of a modern combat weapon. In addition, the M1A1s long range armament made some of its targets vulnerable to artillery fire at long range, particularly in the coastal defense of South Korea.\nThe M1, along with its older brother the M3 tank, went into retirement in 1970. The M1 received numerous awards during WWII, including one Medal of Honor for serving in France, and is listed on the American National Museum's National Register of Historic Places. In addition, the M1 has been designated as the United States Department of the Navy s Distinguished Service Tank as of August 2010.","token_len":608,"entropy":[7.1107,7.9199,4.1722,5.4506,5.5123,0.7508,1.9792,0.9695,5.0822,6.5675,0.5204,0.0835,7.2273,13.756,6.9723,10.9411,7.7583,7.3841,4.3446,10.7215,4.0205,2.2296,11.6856,9.2929,0.2469,1.611,1.8138,7.4797,0.6312,8.4188,6.9424,0.0266,6.0842,2.6448,7.4394,5.2279,8.1273,12.0105,8.898,6.6619,2.7524,5.6834,2.4706,7.2656,0.0406,4.4016,2.4354,3.5349,4.5846,8.4877,5.076,3.1795,0.0189,6.9244,1.6807,0.8489,3.5697,5.5493,0.1063,3.7835,3.2821,2.2438,0.1303,0.405,2.7722,2.6434,3.3257,2.5331,3.6573,2.0738,5.7928,3.3043,2.8185,0.665,7.2041,4.2077,4.916,0.0294,0.9177,3.3951,0.1375,4.5895,0.4707,2.0426,5.3022,2.5414,0.5017,3.3295,1.1231,3.6939,3.6629,0.0151,0.0659,0.0637,5.9647,1.5687,0.2937,0.0812,2.5889,4.9712,3.8496,6.7548,6.8594,2.9204,0.6506,2.5015,3.2733,2.8645,9.9025,7.5718,14.5073,6.7988,3.7917,2.754,8.3618,0.0994,2.6131,5.1041,5.2024,5.1145,2.0322,5.1618,2.0027,1.4661,2.1176,8.6104,2.2305,5.4939,0.1073,7.1916,3.8497,1.7043,3.1419,6.4637,5.408,2.4843,3.3044,1.6063,2.7448,1.2268,3.9097,6.5098,1.7455,2.0576,3.1738,1.8967,0.2879,4.2463,2.7752,2.5196,0.7442,4.3004,0.9449,6.9881,0.6038,4.8775,1.169,0.3043,7.2296,0.1621,0.1719,2.2109,1.1685,0.6773,3.8153,4.1538,6.1081,4.6462,0.5348,0.332,0.5808,0.4403,1.1485,5.1499,0.0774,5.9177,6.6233,0.0303,1.7963,4.7859,3.5345,4.7877,1.3272,2.7117,8.1157,5.1653,2.0655,6.9761,2.828,3.1432,5.9903,6.8103,5.6644,4.493,1.2096,4.9586,1.6984,2.7817,4.3663,1.5253,0.0397,1.6585,2.4154,1.4843,0.6316,1.5337,0.8733,1.337,0.2418,2.2668,0.8378,2.142,1.7366,0.0504,3.321,1.373,1.6147,1.607,0.4639,2.0639,6.4954,1.2876,6.1747,0.835,0.8636,11.3426,7.4619,0.8495,6.8899,3.199,0.4306,0.2765,0.7936,0.8452,0.273,3.0628,2.1334,7.0872,4.7016,3.0505,0.2794,0.0842,4.022,3.3907,1.516,2.5194,4.3411,4.4176,6.4575,2.6707,1.2042,3.0619,0.0336,3.0186,0.1548,4.6248,1.3328,0.0916,0.0529,0.4686,1.0157,0.8797,0.0872,7.149,5.0149,1.5119,5.3094,2.9384,4.6828,2.8569,1.9131,5.3669,2.2755,1.7407,4.3231,0.4038,0.0079,0.8603,4.118,0.4279,1.3221,1.753,0.8276,0.0849,7.1907,2.2256,4.5306,0.7972,4.2748,1.5744,4.5238,1.8452,3.3856,3.1777,0.5419,5.9614,0.7455,1.1258,1.9125,7.8466,4.7774,4.8518,1.4523,3.1561,0.6418,3.8493,0.5277,2.5548,0.9813,4.4688,0.2011,0.8981,6.9491,0.5651,2.1867,0.708,0.4987,0.5324,0.0851,5.8658,0.671,0.3015,1.9107,6.2125,4.9317,6.5581,6.3011,2.9295,3.8408,1.3549,6.9722,2.5492,1.8425,5.5528,1.1449,4.7773,0.001,0.772,2.3233,3.3968,0.476,0.9288,0.6959,0.0751,0.773,4.6,2.8884,5.1905,2.0874,1.4099,0.8443,0.0534,3.744,2.2188,7.1811,8.762,9.9524,6.7283,2.8102,7.4452,4.2636,5.6996,4.0526,3.8643,0.1945,2.2477,2.2549,0.0407,5.4984,2.6233,1.9164,1.5118,0.874,0.1288,3.0364,1.9793,4.9189,1.5077,2.7876,4.5028,1.1364,1.3351,3.0498,5.6511,0.3212,0.5246,2.9347,1.4792,3.0382,1.7703,7.1703,0.5649,7.086,0.4883,0.1955,0.4396,0.0732,6.0961,2.2057,0.8504,4.1811,0.1414,4.4344,0.9595,0.0336,0.9311,2.8687,0.8164,2.1548,1.7538,6.3585,3.4534,0.3388,0.0017,1.0899,3.6638,0.7453,8.9809,8.5998,2.1819,1.9256,4.2485,3.6528,0.1858,4.4309,5.6701,2.7279,4.3683,1.1385,2.5817,1.0624,0.8852,1.5221,1.7065,7.3261,1.4611,1.3404,4.9052,0.7016,0.5313,3.7545,6.4387,3.0621,0.752,1.2116,1.5799,3.0557,0.1839,0.5505,1.5853,2.8855,0.8574,0.9188,2.8625,4.6911,0.2331,0.71,0.1122,0.531,4.0707,10.4412,4.9883,0.9203,0.5259,2.1596,0.96,2.3512,6.1711,7.2911,9.244,3.7144,2.9671,3.8457,0.0028,0.3745,0.554,0.2119,1.3172,0.8884,4.5517,0.0285,2.894,0.5873,1.8619,0.6411,3.6992,2.8455,4.0957,2.8373,0.7751,2.3,3.9325,0.466,0.6951,0.7847,1.2715,1.0251,5.5681,5.3982,6.8406,0.8453,7.8179,0.0745,4.6403,5.9792,1.8347,1.6342,5.2539,3.8207,0.5132,4.0381,0.481,5.2465,3.2058,1.2155,1.679,3.4895,1.6759,1.0873,5.5152,6.2724,2.7308,5.0271,2.3778,0.6858,1.1422,1.0292,0.664,0.6128,5.2189,2.5591,0.001,2.1541,5.0756,4.2638,1.2131,0.3923,3.1997,6.652,0.5561,6.1393,1.2081,7.6243,0.509,3.6475,0.5229,1.2138,0.4731,1.0317,7.9717,5.9376,4.5633,3.7712,5.3402,0.9759,0.5525,3.9482,4.1278,0.0799,0.2193,1.283,5.8579,1.0042,5.8722,1.6106,1.9357,6.1362,3.9464,1.5923,0.1966,4.2955,3.6943,3.3944,0.6144,3.0253,1.4701,0.1381,0.1656,0.0369,0.5163,3.2754,2.3691,0.5091,0.6039,0.3409,0.2,3.3243,0.6447,5.0266,1.7014,1.7018,5.7468,0.0342,5.1799,0.0086,1.2752,3.0862,10.2565,6.3122,0.0032,0.6483,7.2488,6.1023,4.0397,3.4854,5.5064,0.2916]}
{"prompt":"Originally scheduled to be played on November 20 , in July 2010 this game was moved to Thursday , November 18 to give the Crimson Tide extra time to prepare for its game against Auburn","text":"Originally scheduled to be played on November 20, in July 2010 this game was moved to Thursday, November 18 to give the Crimson Tide extra time to prepare for its game against Auburn. As the game was postponed due to Hurricane Rita, the game was moved back to August 25.\nIn the second week of the regular season against Oklahoma, the two teams locked up a double bowl game. The game was set for Saturday, November 20, as originally scheduled. However, before the game could be played, the Oklahoma game was canceled due to Hurricane Rita, making it necessary for Alabama to reschedule this game for Monday, Sunday, November 22, to accommodate both teams.\nAuburn won the game 52, 41 that night to retain the national championship. The national title game came two weeks later, on Saturday, November 29.\nIn the regular season finale for both teams, the Crimson Tide and the Tigers squared off at Memorial Stadium. After posting a 28\u20139 win over Southern Miss at home, the team got ready to play its home game against Alabama, with the game beginning at 1 p.m. After failing to break open the Tide's defense for more than two quarters, the Tigers finally got on the board with a long touchdown pass in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter. With a 5-yard rushing drive to the Crimson Tide sideline, defensive lineman Ben Allen scored to tie the game at 15. With less than two minutes left to play, senior running back Johnny Manziel took over and hit one more touchdown run to send the Tigers on to the championship game. However, as the Tigers neared the Alabama sideline, senior wide receiver Michael Gordon blocked senior defensive back Mike Williams from scoring a touchdown run and ending Auburn s championship hopes.\nThe Crimson Tide defeated Auburn in two games to win the national championship. During the championship game, senior quarterback Michael Sam threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns; he was named National Football League Player of the Week for his performance. His running back, Johnny Manziel, recorded a rushing touchdown; his other touchdown came on a rushing catch in the final minute of the game. On the defensive side of the ball, Alabama kept the Tigers from scoring by holding them to one of their two touchdown attempts. Senior defensive back Trey Flowers led the team in tackles (10), including three sacks, to earn First Team All-American recognition. Both offensive linemen Chris Spencer and Darryl Carter were named First Team All-Southern Conference.

{"prompt":"A successful generalist predator , the cougar will eat any animal it can catch , from insects to large ungulates ( over 500 kg ) . Like all cats , it is an obligate carnivore","text":"A successful generalist predator, the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large ungulates ( over 500 kg ). Like all cats, it is an obligate carnivore, which means it must find its food by killing other animals, and in northern areas, eating the carcasses of large vertebrates that die, such as wolves and grizzlies. With only about 1,200 captive animals in the world today, cougars are considered critically endangered. However, their populations are rising and several states now have cougar sanctuaries. Cougars ( also called mountain lions ) are not the only carnivores that can make excellent pets. Puma In the wild, pumas are found in North America from Mexico to Alaska. In the United States, they are the largest carnivore except coyotes, and they can grow to be up to 4, 500 kg. Like cougars, pumas live mostly in mountainous regions, especially in and around the Rockies. Pumas are solitary animals, spending most of their time hiding away in the rocks, trees and brush, and they are very good at this. With their powerful legs and big body, they can run fast for much of the day. They also have keen senses to catch moving prey or to detect the proximity of danger.\nA wolf cub is not afraid of the big white dog, and the two are easily confused. Wolf cubs are born with a black nose and usually have white fur on their bodies. They are about 8 weeks old when they emerge from the den and begin their first true day. They learn how to hunt at a very young age, and are capable of killing a large dog by the age of 5 or 6. Dogs are more social animals than wolves, and they hunt in packs. Pups will sometimes follow a wolf in search of food or as a playmate. Wolf pups look similar to wolves and have the same black nose, so it can be difficult to tell the differences in appearance. Like all mammals, pups need special care, and the easiest way to prevent them from getting sick is to make sure they get plenty of clean water and to keep them in good care.\nRaccoons have a long history as pets. They are native to North America, from Florida to Alaska and the eastern part of Canada. They have a rounded body, which allows them to climb tall tree branches. They are also very good swimmers. The common names raccoon ( in the UK ) and raccoon dog ( in the US ) refer to the fact that they are close relatives of the dog. It has been found that they are still a valuable companion with the exception of southern North America. However, southern raccoons are not considered to be very good pets. In the wild, they live primarily in suburban and rural areas. They can make good pets, but they tend to have more problems than other rats. They can live up to 7 years in captivity, though only about 3 can be expected.","token_len":610,"entropy":[9.2038,7.8583,5.7829,12.1316,1.6631,2.6488,9.997,0.1807,3.018,4.1145,2.5588,2.6645,1.8009,1.3673,2.8286,1.3566,3.9508,4.235,0.4345,4.166,8.067,0.7289,0.0826,3.3465,13.6842,4.1567,3.4177,2.8314,5.997,2.4295,5.0325,0.2174,1.826,1.8888,3.7868,4.9175,0.0385,1.1058,0.0458,1.3998,2.8162,0.6997,0.8529,4.1805,4.5585,2.34,3.2319,3.5922,6.4752,2.6503,2.3087,2.0785,2.4256,4.47,9.3686,3.4244,1.3607,5.7314,2.9604,3.9038,0.1764,0.119,4.2816,5.6032,0.0291,4.228,7.2036,4.445,1.8372,0.0015,6.5181,1.2424,5.3485,0.6781,0.364,5.712,4.2327,3.0605,2.7047,2.4542,2.7565,7.8831,3.5195,1.9137,1.1122,1.8945,3.9439,0.1444,1.8573,0.1959,0.7889,3.0359,6.4215,0.1067,1.0646,3.8208,0.0256,3.2439,3.8229,1.2148,3.7236,2.3077,6.8604,4.3811,4.0755,1.1783,3.5542,1.1602,5.5565,0.0002,0.0,1.4838,4.0835,0.5518,5.4869,5.7602,0.8006,5.2412,0.5781,1.3973,0.6076,4.149,3.2349,0.331,2.2966,0.1508,1.7579,2.5088,5.1072,5.4321,1.249,0.9354,6.7929,5.4123,8.3148,1.7431,3.0615,0.1254,2.3602,2.1523,0.0023,0.8442,3.9374,0.7265,6.0983,0.1661,5.041,2.8753,0.4237,3.6696,1.1544,2.9099,1.3832,1.7251,0.0247,0.1711,1.6452,0.4954,3.2773,2.0689,0.6742,1.2497,7.5663,7.4017,0.087,1.1898,2.3918,1.8455,2.4992,4.0635,0.6416,2.4203,2.9221,0.0008,3.614,3.9189,8.9063,1.1978,1.4669,5.2829,2.7139,0.0592,0.1219,0.4669,0.0541,0.0041,3.5559,4.5699,0.317,4.8507,1.7397,1.5794,4.1801,0.6462,6.7046,0.3164,1.3422,3.3378,0.7633,2.2329,0.7002,0.0043,1.125,4.8701,1.4072,0.9524,8.1062,0.8673,0.0273,0.0294,0.0918,5.4035,3.9871,1.1255,2.348,5.8539,1.7915,4.699,1.2155,4.7856,2.0419,1.4298,2.5413,1.5935,3.0206,3.7777,1.1869,5.9617,1.0584,5.2722,2.3984,4.7688,4.3299,0.9621,4.1628,4.1095,0.5257,1.7176,1.109,3.5942,4.7248,3.9858,5.0503,0.702,1.2178,0.3,1.2099,1.6875,1.9935,1.1097,6.8459,1.9049,4.5853,4.3443,8.1086,0.3283,4.1725,2.7222,3.4834,3.5775,7.2464,0.051,4.6381,0.3351,4.2462,6.7163,6.2159,3.7102,2.1609,4.8935,6.8931,0.4444,2.6221,4.1254,3.4846,4.5381,1.7396,2.2158,3.2728,4.4708,2.0857,4.8622,4.0342,1.2281,3.9026,0.5051,0.0176,0.8614,5.1695,1.1674,1.6863,5.5542,3.9003,0.92,6.3614,1.2367,2.879,1.5411,2.3308,0.5924,3.4649,0.513,1.5872,1.2179,4.8107,3.77,3.3974,0.3669,2.1604,0.4104,5.5037,0.4594,1.0775,3.8962,2.0581,3.3803,1.9461,2.7428,9.4314,3.7888,1.1632,1.4894,5.1823,2.9257,0.0136,1.7987,4.2264,2.0766,3.2327,0.4824,0.0207,0.9639,0.9826,2.4753,4.0504,0.0455,4.1477,3.2213,1.5926,4.134,3.0734,3.5154,4.8182,0.0503,2.4983,2.052,0.1082,0.4533,6.6141,1.1967,4.1458,3.9075,0.9041,0.8259,1.6964,0.6429,0.613,1.6191,4.7709,2.5036,1.5047,1.5971,4.2993,2.1941,3.4503,3.9204,5.9967,1.5851,2.7985,3.3243,4.8824,0.0456,0.4638,2.7735,5.1589,0.762,5.7802,0.2947,0.6746,4.125,3.6988,0.0084,6.0758,3.4076,0.1112,2.693,2.4934,2.8035,3.1759,0.3501,5.2341,2.7766,1.5359,4.0745,2.6281,3.7635,0.1447,2.3172,0.3254,0.6272,2.5357,2.8176,3.6804,1.7496,0.5994,5.5092,3.4823,4.2321,0.0943,1.1377,0.0899,4.5013,5.2627,2.5978,2.1945,1.2886,3.0954,7.301,0.1299,0.14,4.1425,1.1513,0.1356,2.4453,3.0715,0.3856,0.2994,4.6977,0.6795,0.7879,2.446,3.1576,0.0232,4.5867,0.4316,1.6086,3.1693,1.609,0.4357,2.67,1.7598,4.4477,0.4191,2.421,5.4403,1.0698,0.134,3.5613,1.4404,2.5677,1.3333,3.7359,1.4926,0.9435,1.5353,1.15,4.2829,0.0461,1.9466,0.1715,0.7503,4.4602,5.1527,0.184,2.6031,2.1506,3.2437,5.1369,4.5286,0.0064,3.003,0.5262,1.2122,1.9979,2.56,9.2206,1.8819,1.1437,2.7606,2.7134,0.1105,0.0469,3.3902,4.1862,3.8197,2.0891,1.9754,0.9991,1.31,1.889,1.9633,2.2405,6.6444,0.012,1.4556,2.9698,5.2922,5.3158,7.3435,0.9363,2.5876,5.8702,2.0181,3.2739,0.6368,0.2033,1.3678,0.1043,4.1271,0.1566,0.3863,0.3811,0.391,0.3719,2.7412,0.0418,1.57,6.1807,0.0648,0.6659,1.0207,5.891,1.0479,0.3949,1.3895,4.3171,1.215,4.2633,3.1207,0.3763,3.8947,0.2405,3.0706,1.216,6.9656,3.3735,5.5803,1.5458,5.8287,2.3826,3.8226,0.0563,8.7595,5.0582,0.5491,0.891,4.486,0.0205,9.2969,3.4273,0.983,0.0002,0.8924,2.0332,2.941,1.7342,0.1218,3.5423,1.6923,1.3047,1.1224,2.9237,1.6144,3.0739,0.1924,2.5234,3.3666,3.7508,0.3208,7.5387,3.093,0.7835,0.0855,1.3104,1.4111,2.2477,4.5785,2.4541,0.6096,1.9676,1.0168,1.3694,4.1859,0.0643,3.0863,3.7751,1.4309,1.3703,5.043,7.9936,1.2879,2.1383,1.9062,3.9208,3.2946,0.0689,4.6371,0.3565,0.9345,1.4097,0.8014,3.8951,4.8294,2.1226,2.5883,5.5936,1.3248,5.748,3.0681]}

The","text":"A number of scientific organizations headed by the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) organized a network of amateur astronomers and students to measure Earth's distance from the Sun during the transit. The results of the effort are now published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ( BASA ) online.\nFrom December 2007 to March 2012, observers in the Southern Hemisphere (from Argentina to Chile ) reported that the Sun's limb passed through the Earth's shadow about eight times, and, more importantly, each time Earth was in a similar place in its orbit around the Sun. This allowed the scientists to determine Earth's distance from the Sun and to predict the transit, with an accuracy of several tens of miles per second (m s ).\nThe calculations used a sophisticated numerical model of the Earth's orbital motion to predict the position of Earth during the transit. The model also included detailed information obtained from the Sun and an Earth-based radar experiment, which have been used to increase the accuracy of the calculations to about 3 m s. The observations are a result of more than three million observations of the Sun by amateur astronomers over the three-year period.\n\" Our analysis shows that the Sun's limb has passed through Earth's shadow about eight times, but only once during each season, \" says Dr. Thomas Binzel, lead author of the new BASA paper ( A.S.B. 11 B.11 ). \" As a result, it is difficult to estimate the seasonal variations of Earth's distance and velocity from the Sun, \" Binzel explains further.\nAs well as Binzel, the paper has authors from Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Austria and Portugal, among others. The results support one hypothesis put forward in 2011 by the Japanese astronomer Noboru Ozawa to explain the seasonality of the Earth's distance from the Sun. Ozawa's theory is based on observations by the Lunar and Planetary Institute ( LPI ) in Chicago. Those observations indicate that the planet Mercury moves at a uniform speed relative to the Sun around a point on Earth's surface, in the equatorial direction, known as the Sun-Earth-Mercury ( S-E-M ) line. However, the observations do not explain how the Mercury-Moon-Solar system is affected by the seasons.\nBy studying these seasonal variations in the distance of the Earth from the Sun, the authors were able to confirm that the position of Mercury during the transits is similar to the position of Earth when the Sun passes through Earth's shadow.\n\" This observation supports the idea of the S-E-M line, which may explain how the planet Mercury moves with the seasons, \" says Jens Fiedler, an author of the BASA paper, from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Heidelberg. \" It is very likely that the S-E-M line rotates around the Sun due to the oblateness of the Sun by about 1 m s per year and explains the seasonality of the Mercury-Moon system.

Construction of this structure was completed in 1820. A petition to erect a cemetery on land just off the East River near the Old Pine Church was passed by the board of Trustees, at a meeting on March 1st, 1826, and the location was chosen on the northeast corner of a lot that had belonged to the old Pine Church site. A stone obelisk, erected in 1872, commemorates the cemetery.\nThe Cemetery is located on the northeast corner of East River and Pine Street in the Pine Avenue Historic District.\nIn 1829, a stone altar was erected in its place, in memory of Sarah, Hannah, and Esther Hatcher, wives of the Rev. William Hatcher, pastor of St. Matthew\u2019s Church at East Fishkill in the 1830\u2019s, and sists of the Rev. Philip Hatcher, the first pastor of the First Congregational Church of East Fishkill. This memorial was relocated in 1857. A stone memorial for Samuel Baker, teacher at the former Pine Brook Free Academy was erected in 1871. Dr. Samuel Baker was the pastor of St. Matthew\u2019s Church at East Fishkill and the first member of the congregation of First Congregational Church of East Fishkill. A second stone memorial, erected in 1890, marks the location of a brick building which was used as the Sunday School Building for the children of the Old Pine Church cemetery until the building was torn down and built into a fire shelter in the 1930\u2019s.\nThe present stone structure was placed in the cemetery in 1922 and is a memorial to William Hartley Sr., the first minister of St. Matthew\u2019s Church. The granite stones were donated at the insistence of William Hartley, Jr., also the first rector of First Congregational Church of East Fishkill.\nA stone commemorating the dedication of St Matthew\u2019s Church was erected shortly after its dedication in 1835. This memorial was relocated to the north side of the church in the 1860's, and in 1872, the congregation was able to purchase the land on which the church stands today. Dr. William Hatcher was in charge of the memorial stone when it was relocated.\nThe stone, which is now located in the north aisle of the church, has remained the same since its first use.

{"prompt":"The Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its neighbouring village of Point Edward to the city of Port Huron in the United States . It spans the St. Clair River , which connects Lake Huron","text":"The Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its neighbouring village of Point Edward to the city of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake Erie. Built in 1869, it's the longest suspension bridge west of the Mississippi.\nThe old Blue Water Bridge was designed by Charles E. Elston, a local architect, and built by the Canadian Tire Construction Co. from 1858 to 1862. Built to span the St. Clair River, the bridge also provided a direct roadway to Port Huron, then a small industrial centre known as the Little Canada Factory. Construction of the first bridge was slowed by winter, so a second bridge, also designed by Elston, was built in 1869 under the name Queen Street Bridge. A new bridge, constructed in 1877, opened a direct link between the communities of Sarnia and Port Huron, and the bridge was renamed Lake Shore Avenue Bridge. In 1914, the St. Clair Electric Lighting Company was authorized to construct a bridge over the Sarnia to Port Huron Ferry, which was not completed until 1917. The original Sarnia\u2013Port Huron Bridge was destroyed by fire in 1946, only a few months following its inaugural run. At the time, it was replaced by a bridge built by the Port Huron and Sarnia Steam Navigation Company and designed by William H. Bogle. This was, until recently, the second longest bridge in Canada. In 1965, the Sarnia\u2013Port Huron Bridge was designated as the second best bridge in the world, after the Golden Gate Bridge. In 2007, the bridge was purchased from the Port Huron and Sarnia Steam Navigation Company by the Port Authority of Ontario. In 2011, in preparation for the 2014 Winter Games in the United States, the Port Authority of Ontario completed the work to convert the bridge to accommodate a light rail line. The Port Authority of Ontario opened the light rail line between the City of Sarnia and Port Huron, as well as to Port Huron and Michillimackinac in Port Huron. The Port Authority of Ontario has stated that the bridge is expected to remain open until at least 2055. The Blue Water Bridge has attracted tourists and photographers since its opening in 1869.

{"prompt":"While working on the animated television series Rocko 's Modern Life , Phineas and Ferb co @ - @ founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff `` Swampy `` Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes","text":"While working on the animated television series Rocko's Modern Life, Phineas and Ferb co @ - @ founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff `` Swampy `` Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes. First, they utilized a lot of characters. Second, each episode contained a series of songs. Most notable was the song `` Swampy's Song '' from the second episode. This was a song that Phineas did not wish to sing. Nevertheless, Dan decided to include this song within the episode, since it was used to highlight particular events within the episode.\nThe second and final episode of Phineas and Ferb featured the song \" Phineas and Ferb and the Piano \" (written by Phineas as a song for his sister ) and performed by Phineas and Ferb. There was a piano in every episode, and the main purpose of the main protagonists playing the piano and singing was to be entertaining. Dan Povenmire and Jeff Marsh stated that when they first began their Phineas and Ferb series, they wanted to make it fun for the audience and thought that they would not be able to come up with too many ideas if they were to make a movie. Therefore, they decided that they would have to utilize some characters who they felt would fit the series. Some of these characters include Mr. P, Phineas, and Ferb. Dan Povenmire did not like the idea of having the main characters use a song as a premise. Nevertheless, he thought that they would be able to keep this as a regular part of the series. He also feels that the episodes would not become too repetitive if they included songs and would be able to make a good storyline, and this is why he decided to include the song'in the first two episodes of the show.\nThe song \" Swampy's Song \" is the theme song of the show and is not only an important scene within the show, it is also of a humorous nature. This show is mainly for children, and they love to see something to laugh about. Having a funny song that they will remember is a huge plus for the show, and Dan Povenmire thought that songs would be a good addition to the show. The song was so important within the show that it was used by all the actors and actresses, as well as all the other characters who were being mentioned.\nThe Phineas and Ferb Series has been a hit since the first time it was aired in 2002, and the last episode aired in 2003, after 20 seasons of shows. The show is still being transmitted today, and this shows how long the show has been going on.

{"prompt":"In the event that the Court rejected the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847 , Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction","text":"In the event that the Court rejected the argument that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847, Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse in 1855 was not inconsistent with the principle of uti iuris and the concept of maritime entitlement.\n[It] appears to have been based on the view that [Singapore] would otherwise lose these interests in future... and would therefore not benefit from their ownership, [they would suffer a loss], even though the lighthouse was built in China. This cannot therefore be regarded as consistent with maritime entitlement.\nIn his decision of 1997, the Court did recognise the right of Singapore to maintain possession of Pedra Branca if this were an appropriate act given the political context. The Chinese Government had been threatening Singapore with the use of force. In the Court's view, the Government of Singapore was not relying on maritime entitlements but rather on its possession of the site at the time that the property was occupied by Singaporean armed men. Moreover, the Court noted that the Government and public opinion in Singapore had also taken exception to the construction of the lighthouse as a military asset, thereby highlighting the importance of public opinion in the decision of the Court.\nIn a landmark decision, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the High Court and upheld the Court of First Instance's finding. The Court of Appeal held that although the principle of uti iuris cannot be recognised, the Court should nevertheless consider whether the fact the Singaporean property had originally been occupied by Singaporeans and the construction of a lighthouse on it would cause a loss to Singapore or put Singapore at a disadvantage in the event that China claimed sovereignty over Singapore. The court noted that the Chinese Government had no territorial rights over Singapore at the time. The court also noted that the construction of the lighthouse was intended for the safe navigation of ships in international waters, and that this was a public interest requirement. Moreover, a public interest must be balanced with a private interest of the Government of Singapore. In making this decision, the court held that the fact that Singapore held possession at a time when the sovereignty of China over Singapore was open to question did not render the site in possession of Singapore terra nullius.\nThe Court of Appeal also held that it was inconsistent with the position adopted in the decision of 1997 that the Government and public opinion in Singapore had also taken exception to the construction of the lighthouse as a military asset and that this highlighted the importance of public opinion in the decision of the Court. The court held that the fact that the Government of Singapore had no territorial rights over the relevant properties does not mean that they are in a state of terra nullius. Thus, their right of possession must be considered in the light of the principle of public law that States have a legitimate interest in maintaining the possession of their own property; this is particularly so when these properties also have a value related to international peace and security. This judgment was handed down unanimously.","token_len":614,"entropy":[2.6222,4.2164,1.0908,1.7464,6.5668,8.1675,0.9264,3.736,0.9479,11.8069,4.1414,9.0953,4.0566,1.7548,13.183,1.0862,0.8256,0.1215,2.7695,7.8898,4.024,0.316,12.3551,8.0568,0.2344,1.1224,8.8488,0.7438,4.5891,0.0037,0.1675,0.0001,1.6397,1.3443,7.7573,1.908,7.1891,5.7775,4.8206,7.1738,1.0056,3.6623,1.6105,3.1715,0.0778,0.7195,0.7868,3.1491,0.7782,3.7237,2.6061,2.466,4.9431,0.0053,0.5554,5.23,0.3923,13.0295,5.2452,6.5871,5.2151,3.561,4.5481,2.7096,5.8538,0.0651,7.2889,7.8166,0.7455,1.7186,10.4662,8.1588,1.6192,3.7784,2.099,2.6321,0.3851,3.754,0.4334,0.9945,2.7657,0.3877,5.267,6.7043,0.0005,0.6316,2.8375,6.8313,5.6443,7.0875,4.073,2.1453,5.2484,7.807,3.588,3.0755,2.2555,2.3904,4.8708,0.3999,5.0271,7.4362,3.0466,5.6743,5.6341,2.5977,5.432,4.4361,2.2479,4.0581,4.0464,1.5004,1.4264,3.3867,1.6717,1.834,1.5509,7.5605,1.4773,3.2047,6.3243,5.7078,0.2262,2.57,0.0495,4.8498,0.0215,4.951,0.9327,1.2129,1.062,3.9532,3.2154,3.0527,3.9071,8.8477,0.451,1.3972,1.029,4.8291,8.3641,1.6683,4.0205,0.2167,1.0379,0.2629,3.088,7.1831,0.1319,7.6656,0.0012,0.0463,0.0003,5.0935,4.8147,2.3757,4.6928,3.6744,7.8416,6.3896,0.6242,6.045,3.4535,1.4357,2.2036,6.1652,2.4763,1.4288,2.854,6.4872,4.6361,0.5011,2.9798,4.1883,0.0038,2.4257,3.54,2.4351,2.1479,6.3267,0.4314,0.3224,0.213,1.1982,3.1119,3.4701,0.5283,1.7867,2.192,6.1636,0.3002,4.2591,2.5174,0.0056,2.5395,2.0923,0.7724,3.2005,5.8264,0.2035,0.995,4.5862,3.9676,2.2045,1.3707,4.5591,0.9471,6.6037,0.2142,6.0427,2.0928,2.42,3.4004,7.2733,3.5908,0.5438,4.8844,0.0098,0.9717,1.7349,2.6899,0.1828,1.1227,2.3433,5.0242,6.9957,5.0431,2.394,1.0581,1.2003,5.7433,3.9418,7.0563,0.0503,0.5499,4.2211,0.1917,0.4792,0.3916,3.6945,1.3932,4.1171,4.576,2.0756,5.4158,6.2579,0.4852,1.8559,0.0436,6.5025,1.7209,0.8494,1.8735,2.6914,1.4128,0.1677,0.829,0.4892,0.8825,2.4798,3.321,4.8661,1.0329,1.6513,0.6287,1.3056,1.316,0.1605,4.166,0.7008,2.2313,0.3666,0.1178,1.8205,0.0243,2.7521,3.4427,0.4272,5.5414,0.8503,7.3251,0.1409,0.0281,1.4588,3.6137,4.8883,1.0955,1.4769,1.4033,0.0515,2.2401,0.1118,5.2577,0.6603,7.0881,0.0738,3.2715,0.0783,0.8057,0.0032,0.0017,6.2575,0.3575,6.3808,2.3193,0.9723,5.0131,3.6737,5.6007,3.0285,1.6099,0.9286,5.4592,4.73,4.8084,0.6445,7.6129,2.6978,6.1034,0.2233,2.1876,0.1911,2.3472,1.6906,3.2724,2.8243,3.5089,0.199,2.4595,0.1941,3.4553,1.7771,3.2775,4.3455,1.5944,2.0614,1.1611,0.8894,4.3613,6.9816,1.5563,1.588,1.0325,0.5113,1.605,1.0948,2.0646,1.2326,6.1284,6.2858,4.8828,0.3023,4.6673,0.4869,1.7475,3.1909,2.9786,0.1337,0.9035,3.506,0.4837,0.462,4.5021,4.8417,3.6485,1.5287,3.0477,4.1893,0.137,0.0183,4.9734,1.9914,1.6877,1.88,1.6111,0.108,0.7845,3.4717,0.1244,0.3788,0.0646,1.5914,4.4648,3.2388,1.7162,7.2715,4.6317,0.159,3.2159,2.42,3.7681,0.0336,1.6468,1.1987,1.1226,3.6494,1.2614,2.3306,5.255,1.0637,5.9894,1.0406,4.8338,0.0009,4.9111,3.5407,0.1471,4.8077,0.5132,5.2456,1.9086,1.8534,2.7882,0.1544,4.7867,1.2866,3.2982,1.2652,0.1735,0.7796,3.0532,4.6185,1.0551,1.3735,0.1455,0.0435,1.9335,3.0853,0.0749,0.6724,4.4305,0.2488,2.1983,4.2675,2.3957,6.492,3.8425,0.5854,0.2262,1.0933,8.5627,0.2643,1.2727,3.5104,1.6649,0.334,7.7096,0.7072,4.4431,3.0597,0.0111,3.7355,0.6712,6.892,3.115,6.4424,0.4928,2.1341,9.5329,0.1039,0.0036,0.0086,0.6663,0.705,1.713,1.5905,0.5767,0.0473,1.9846,1.6421,0.0767,3.5664,0.6464,3.8394,0.1868,0.3626,6.218,3.7627,1.7646,1.2305,3.8344,0.2001,7.759,2.0783,0.7717,2.4386,2.8189,0.8959,0.061,0.4706,0.1412,0.3388,1.8216,0.0886,0.1879,0.0047,0.0801,0.3619,0.026,0.1815,0.0365,0.5266,0.0346,0.0335,0.0012,2.3115,1.2958,2.1036,8.0191,0.163,0.4098,0.0104,0.2291,0.0069,0.1303,0.1285,0.4101,0.0292,0.0134,0.178,0.3668,1.5325,1.5385,2.9905,0.0633,0.6041,3.455,0.1456,0.5496,2.0184,1.7673,0.0156,0.8742,3.5466,0.258,0.0327,0.0527,1.4694,7.5988,6.218,5.9166,0.004,2.1492,0.2501,2.5175,3.1385,3.4418,2.4255,2.7145,0.0203,5.8723,0.0246,0.0168,0.0197,0.5488,4.9622,0.1733,6.9197,2.8279,1.8298,1.8844,5.1811,0.5168,2.2033,1.3675,1.5394,0.739,0.041,0.6035,4.0346,0.102,7.038,6.3705,3.5597,7.524,1.5657,1.4658,5.0985,0.511,0.1114,1.3423,2.0559,5.1468,0.1472,0.7988,1.5771,2.5046,6.2233,2.9133,1.4913,4.0052,2.8027,1.4903,5.3733,2.3546,6.7291,1.839,1.2657,4.4747,7.4877,0.0326,3.8869,3.1072,0.5759,0.4082,0.4593,3.5508,5.5427,2.4821,6.324,0.0061,4.8089,3.068]}

Petrov and Senna","text":"The 2012 season saw several driver changes. Lotus chose not to take up an option on Vitaly Petrov's contract, and did not offer Bruno Senna a new contract. Petrov and Senna both returned to the team with Lotus-Renault in 2014 to take over for Valtteri Bottas and Pastor Maldonado respectively. Both Senna and Petrov would finish the season ahead of their previous best, however, no points were scored by either of them.\nThe 2014 season saw the drivers and sponsors change for the same reasons as the previous year. Lotus brought in Jarno Trulli as their new head driver, while the former Lotus Racing sponsor and one-Time Champion of the World Emerson Fittipaldi, is the new title sponsor. At the end of the year, Lotus announced that they would have a change in ownership, who would sell the team to the team's owner, the Swedish-based, Richard Mille, in a deal worth $400 million.\nOn June 17, 2015, it was announced that Lotus will be using the brand's new Lotus-Renault racing team to competed in Formula E from 2016. While they did not compete in the inaugural season of the series, they would take part in the second and third season, competing in the 2015 season at an all-new, high-technology Formula E racing circuit in Diriyah. By the end of the 2015 season, Lotus-Renault finished 3rd in the championship. In the 2016 season, they finished 2nd in the drivers' championship, with Sebastien Buemi winning the Drivers title, and second in the constructors, ahead of the newcomers, Virgin, by 17 points. On April 1, 2017, the two-man team was replaced by two new teams, with a move to Formula E for both drivers of the team. Although they have a strong team behind them and are both well known, with an impressive motorsport history, many question the future of the team as they race in a rather new FIA category with a small engine budget. While they have a strong team behind them and drivers with an impressive motorsport record, many question the future of the team as they race in a rather new FIA category with a small engine budget.?\nOn June 15, 2017, it was announced that Lotus Racing F1 Limited was given the green light to race in Japan's NTT Formula at Suzuka Circuit, in 2018.

Rather","text":"The original Guitar Hero was released on the PlayStation 2 in November 2005. Guitar Hero is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black Gibson SG guitar. Rather than allowing players to pick a controller style and a special controller button for a guitar solo, this guitar model allows users to pick a controller style and two more customizable buttons - one for the open\/close position of the left-handed pickups, and a third for picking up or lowering the note. The controller is called the Guitar Hero 2 and has two other major changes from the game's predecessor. First, it features a \"tap to learn\" feature called \"Switch Lock\" by which players set up their pickups and choose the note of an instrument by pushing their left controller button. Then, the game's standard songbook had 40 songs, including several new songs. A new songbook, including seven new songs, was added with the Guitar Hero 3.\nWhile Guitar Hero was primarily sold on the PlayStation 2 from its release in 2005 through 2008, Guitar Hero 2 was released on Nintendo's Wii platform on 30 November 2005. The Nintendo console version was accompanied by Guitar Hero 2's original Soundtrack, which included 40 tracks. This system sold only in Japan and China. The Nintendo console was followed by the release of Guitar Hero 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2006. Guitar Hero 3 also included the Guitar Hero 2 game along with an additional set of songs from the original Guitar Hero and the first Guitar Hero game. The inclusion of the original guitar controller as a standard feature and new songs did not happen on Guitar Hero 3 or its expansion. The Guitar Hero 3 system was sold only in the United States.\nIn the year 2007, Sega released a direct and free downloadable version of Guitar Hero. This version used a new controller made by Fretech which was specifically optimized for the Windows operating system. It was released with the Windows version of Guitar Hero 3.\n\nMusic genre\n\nThe Guitar Hero 2 game provides a variety of classic rock and pop music, heavy metal music, rock n roll music, and jazz music.\n\nReception\n\nThe Guitar Hero franchise has received favorable reviews from critics.\nNathan Bolser from GameSpot says Guitar Hero 2 \"delivers the music\" while adding that \"just about every single move of the guitar comes across as realistic.\" Mike Barker from Engadget gives a mixed review, saying that, while the title \"has its moments,... Guitar Hero 2 might be the weakest game on the Wii yet, if only because Guitar Hero 3 has a much better soundtrack\".\nBarker adds that Guitar Hero 3 \"supersedes its predecessor\" but does criticize the lack of a second guitar sound and the lack of the ability to customize a second controller button and to change out the pickups. The reviews of Guitar Hero 3  in New Yorker and Slate, both also praise the game, but criticize that it still does not have enough songs in its soundtrack and game to fill the 30-minute play time, unlike its predecessor Guitar Hero.","token_len":615,"entropy":[7.2326,10.3672,0.6385,2.3214,1.6147,1.8461,2.3067,2.5968,1.2907,0.7814,3.7781,3.858,0.8187,3.2796,0.0356,4.0632,6.8201,3.0354,0.8695,5.14,4.7786,0.4543,1.4468,4.4557,8.5488,8.5309,0.1099,1.9249,6.8736,7.6482,3.5003,4.3929,0.6502,7.7122,0.0363,6.9337,1.4755,0.0527,3.7896,3.0523,4.3592,5.6906,2.9877,6.1383,6.2451,4.3832,4.0983,2.7582,3.2902,2.2235,4.1199,0.2289,3.0425,4.787,4.2144,2.0455,3.5954,0.0386,2.2319,1.5503,3.3048,0.502,0.905,5.3419,5.7562,6.7633,0.346,5.5681,1.8682,0.4923,1.3345,7.0854,3.9747,1.2898,3.402,2.7283,0.2841,4.8147,3.6498,1.9926,6.6538,1.1239,0.3622,3.2199,2.0753,0.6348,6.4169,1.3501,3.3714,5.9601,0.5644,6.1531,1.0344,1.6866,3.4417,2.7264,5.0714,0.9083,2.1154,0.2066,3.2703,2.4196,2.9984,2.818,5.7275,5.4907,3.8295,4.2311,0.4241,4.0209,2.3411,2.7903,0.8318,2.2475,0.3036,1.9155,3.825,0.8418,3.6296,6.2472,2.7123,5.473,0.1411,2.624,5.11,0.9199,5.7796,6.6287,0.9435,6.4777,0.8155,0.4485,7.6323,2.3915,1.7618,4.4395,2.0755,5.2369,2.1148,5.7791,2.8754,5.8553,1.7944,2.8391,5.7569,3.4873,2.9434,5.3371,0.2408,0.7084,4.057,0.2893,2.2725,3.0861,1.8007,5.9141,6.0244,4.6239,7.9553,9.8913,2.2764,1.9903,3.6355,5.0061,3.4907,0.5856,1.9194,4.4053,2.2685,2.8074,0.8548,2.9887,6.2195,5.5704,1.2136,1.0605,0.4416,0.7097,1.2335,3.5023,0.6765,2.5936,0.0079,2.6522,1.2783,2.0278,10.033,2.3947,0.0145,3.0644,5.4063,5.648,2.0717,0.8933,0.8008,0.6082,6.5883,3.3897,1.5733,1.0062,2.695,2.6474,3.6231,0.1052,2.043,0.014,2.5752,0.8056,0.7356,0.5159,4.552,0.7762,2.2236,5.5751,3.1207,7.1694,2.3637,1.7225,0.4598,1.3446,3.3082,3.9499,2.4661,2.2983,6.0666,0.1208,3.3575,0.0204,1.3864,2.7823,3.0288,4.3534,0.2698,1.6512,1.4815,1.7315,6.3296,2.1201,1.1886,3.8455,6.1348,4.7725,4.2836,2.6354,0.7032,1.5889,4.4494,0.8892,1.8002,2.403,2.4778,3.9463,4.4316,0.1732,1.2261,6.0013,0.0474,0.4674,0.0194,0.4106,1.5373,1.6809,2.0179,0.5523,1.969,2.3176,0.0301,1.1886,3.5375,0.5259,1.8456,0.0083,0.138,2.5831,2.1448,2.4005,2.6706,0.0201,1.3203,4.8326,7.541,0.004,3.6884,1.8758,4.498,0.0294,2.1433,2.9995,0.4147,1.0271,1.5217,0.0102,3.9317,1.9694,4.0676,1.8513,0.0177,1.9245,1.0032,1.8827,7.5185,0.026,1.153,2.0168,3.2512,3.9213,4.2528,0.9036,4.5005,3.0822,4.4356,4.3959,3.2161,4.9751,0.0426,3.9399,4.7144,5.7477,0.0026,0.7139,4.5197,4.1758,6.2064,1.4634,2.2302,2.3786,0.0093,1.1255,3.7493,1.3453,4.0901,2.2483,0.359,2.5034,0.5163,0.0336,1.6232,0.6106,2.6695,1.9401,4.7118,2.8637,0.1923,5.5428,0.3707,2.4241,8.098,6.9899,4.0229,2.1455,1.3789,0.0443,0.5634,0.0157,2.6008,2.1143,1.6836,6.581,1.5969,3.5148,0.956,7.0448,0.5629,8.7435,8.1325,3.7066,1.3167,5.5235,5.6218,0.1249,1.0071,5.6239,3.45,0.0166,0.3901,2.6624,1.167,1.7304,3.8719,1.3707,3.2571,1.9835,0.933,1.1168,0.0088,1.6856,1.5583,1.5623,6.7449,5.5995,8.7648,1.1447,0.0004,1.5847,2.4238,0.0247,3.1177,2.8464,6.8329,1.3813,2.1272,0.0064,5.3271,2.1371,1.6817,2.3682,1.2441,2.4597,7.0389,0.7395,4.1764,0.2764,2.6083,4.2037,0.6053,1.6251,0.2364,1.3318,3.6119,1.0667,0.464,2.31,0.0002,5.6671,0.8013,0.1035,0.0002,1.6261,1.7867,0.0091,5.4782,0.8574,1.2367,4.4106,0.1307,1.1345,1.06,1.8168,2.4285,18.71,4.6876,9.3405,7.1209,6.3578,4.1712,1.082,4.9423,3.2688,0.0092,0.5619,1.7879,5.4049,0.4397,2.17,4.693,6.6176,4.5998,4.466,0.992,1.233,6.3322,2.4755,0.561,2.6937,7.4508,3.0076,0.2855,3.589,5.1228,2.5567,0.3987,6.2472,1.7098,5.5564,7.4371,0.7405,6.8828,0.0162,0.0001,5.4345,3.173,2.1973,1.896,2.4299,1.2521,1.4511,4.5709,2.8832,1.1672,6.0437,2.2149,4.4174,3.1901,2.4693,9.1903,2.6788,0.007,0.2409,5.6176,1.0867,1.0105,5.1728,1.5084,2.2076,0.5712,4.0008,3.6337,1.1097,4.0618,3.3295,0.7465,5.5932,0.0143,2.7146,3.0856,2.2155,3.5097,0.9589,1.7496,5.4683,1.084,16.3915,3.9319,0.0104,2.8702,0.346,2.5281,0.004,1.9701,1.2083,10.9986,2.54,0.0001,3.4878,0.3722,2.1573,4.4209,3.9923,8.4387,0.5555,3.0914,0.0028,2.6446,4.9378,2.2297,5.0357,3.9006,1.6379,1.6249,0.0025,3.2547,3.8641,0.0981,4.9262,2.8643,4.4517,1.2729,4.07,4.4782,5.0266,2.8075,6.2651,0.6558,4.6806,0.9533,3.6044,5.0458,2.0631,0.5375,0.0034,0.5791,11.4016,10.836,5.0002,7.0236,2.7475,5.7667,3.5442,2.3808,5.4112,2.3182,0.2991,1.2153,2.2826,2.4201,4.6447,3.9913,1.3461,5.3519,3.4574,0.1114,1.9096,3.6163,3.4592,3.4108,2.0396,3.2797,2.5809,7.0875,4.8835,3.875,1.1325,7.0677,2.0126,1.8436,3.593,0.7495,4.3141,5.7343,2.9499,0.3285,4.4399,0.0169,2.0724]}

After a brief period of military rule, Jifna and its region came under the control of the British Mandate of Palestine under Lord Allenby, the British Resident, and from 1921 under a governor appointed by Britain. In 1945 Jifna became the center of the Palestine Emergency Council administration of the erstwhile Mandatory Palestine. In 1948 the Mandatory State was given independence as the State of Israel. Two weeks after the state of Israel was established, Jifna (along with the rest of Palestine) was occupied by the Israeli army on June 4th, in accordance with the General Allenby Armistice Agreement of 1949. During the Second Intifada ( 2000-2005 ) Jifna experienced repeated Israeli military assaults, in which more than 100 Israelis have been killed and several hundreds injured.\nGeography\n\nArea\n\nIn total, the area of Jifna consists of 1.16\u00a0km\u00b2 (0.44\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).

The urban area has five villages of Jifna village, Wadi Jizla village, Azzuniyun village, Karkar village, and Wadi Jizla Shaykh Ahmad village. The older part of Jifna is known as the Old Jifna.\nIn addition to human settlements in Jifna, there are villages of sheep, goats, and donkeys in the agricultural areas around the village.

{"prompt":"The 502nd Engineer Company became the first V Corps company @ - @ sized unit to return for a second tour in Iraq when it deployed in September 2004 . The company returned to Hanau","text":"The 502nd Engineer Company became the first V Corps company @ - @ sized unit to return for a second tour in Iraq when it deployed in September 2004. The company returned to Hanau Germany following the end of the occupation of Iraq.\nThe 502nd Engineer Company made three deployments to Afghanistan from 2004-2009. In Fall 2007, the 2nd Battalion left the company as the company moved into Iraq to be integrated into V Corps. The 2nd Battalion participated in the deployment to Afghanistan where they were part of a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF-IMT) in Kandahar Province. Their first deployment was during the period August through September 2004 which was considered a first war tour. Following the end of the war, the 2nd Battalion returned to Germany where we began a second tour in Fall 2007. In 2010, the 2nd Battalion began a third tour in Afghanistan, participating in a CJTF-I-TE mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, which has remained in Afghanistan since.\nThe 3rd Battalion was created from a former Brigade Combat Team (BCT) of the 502nd Transportation Command-Brigade Engineer (502nd TrCo-BrigE) as BCT-735. It was activated in August of 2003 on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and deployed to Iraq in September the same year. The squad began touring Iraq in late March 2009 through December of 2011 and returned home in late January of 2012. During the tour, the squad was credited for establishing 11 temporary security zones in Iraq. The squad did not have as heavy a tour in Afghanistan as the other two BCTs in Afghanistan but due to the increased deployment of the 2nd Battalion from 2011 and the additional combat readiness training they were able to train their equipment prior to the war thus saving a large amount of time in their deployment.\nThe 4th Battalion, 502nd Engineer is the first to serve in the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts. During their deployment in Iraq, the 4th Battalion completed a total of 3,500 days, and traveled nearly two million miles. The 4th Battalion arrived in Iraq in October 2003 after being sent by the V Corps for Operation Libertary Sphere, the first major combat operation of this type. After establishing security in the United States and Iraq, the 4th Battalion provided the primary task force unit for the installation of a United Nations observation post that was attacked on August 28, 2004 with several casualties. In the post, this unit is assigned military police and intelligence, as well as training Afghan security forces, in the art, science and techniques of law enforcement. The 4th Battalion returned to the United States in November 2005.

It does not","text":"The anniversary of the landings, 25 April, has since 1916 been recognised in Australia and New Zealand as Anzac Day, now one of their most important national occasions. It does not fall on a Saturday, as was the case then, in order to ensure that there is adequate time for the people of Britain, who now live far away, to come home to see the war memorials which are erected in his name, such as the one seen above.\nAs a very young man, before the First World War began, I volunteered with the Home Guard at Westgate Park Cemetery near Tooting, near London, where I had a number of friends. It was my pleasure to attend the many memorial services on Anzac Day which were held in memory of the soldiers and sailors, but also of the men who had served with the Australian and New Zealand Home Defence Forces. But a little later the Great War began.\nAnd so, of course, there was a great deal to think about, and to do. We all volunteered to serve in the British Expeditionary Forces and it was a few months before we were able to send the many who were serving in the armed forces back to home.\nThe soldiers and sailors were very happy that they were able to send messages home to their loved ones and they were very grateful to have their families and friends so proud. I was pleased to be able to join in their celebrations.\nThe celebrations ended on the 25th April, and it became evident that the landings in the Azores and in New Guinea were still happening ; I was on duty until the British troops evacuated Europe. I could no longer keep up with the latest news and I stopped my duties. But I was still very keen to see the landings, and in the year or so leading up to the end of the war, my friends and I went to the United Kingdom about once every two months. We went to both the London and the Birmingham war memorials and we saw the remembrance and dedications and the unveiling of the names of the people who had died.\nWe also saw the great warships in Liverpool, and we visited the graves of those who had fallen in action. In the year after the Armistice, in the latter part of the World War, I went back to the UK three or four times and every time I visited my friends and met my father who had left Britain for Australia with his family in 1914.\nThe Australian War Memorial and the Royal Australian Regiment\nThe day after Anzac Day a large parade was held and I was able to go with my friends who were all members of the Royal Australian Regiment. I saw the soldiers marching in London, and their uniforms, and the brass bands playing tunes ; I remember the speeches given to many people. Many of the soldiers were British, but a good many Australians had served on some or all of the transports.\nIt is interesting to note that the Australian people were very proud of their soldiers when they returned home, and they remembered them well when they looked back on their war service.","token_len":618,"entropy":[10.872,0.3535,0.6732,8.7749,3.9878,1.8822,7.3566,5.1501,2.3724,3.4809,7.0399,15.4537,1.1954,4.8106,3.036,5.164,2.2464,2.5305,0.0039,0.9868,9.1712,0.0653,0.0328,1.7435,7.5145,5.2321,0.3796,5.778,1.8749,1.4458,2.3038,3.9786,0.2193,3.706,7.0979,0.2471,5.6462,0.4647,2.3062,3.1835,1.3497,2.9777,4.1632,0.8524,0.1044,5.5437,0.5345,4.378,5.5529,0.0635,5.0386,0.8556,3.6832,2.1659,5.2079,1.4481,0.5377,1.5816,4.4168,0.7141,6.1515,2.6211,3.4743,4.7037,1.6447,5.2126,1.191,1.4791,0.0958,3.9437,4.6361,1.5148,3.6706,1.1256,4.1158,4.1847,1.2298,4.3767,2.6385,3.3092,1.8491,6.2637,2.7069,2.6816,5.7504,0.0687,0.8146,2.8077,6.0632,3.6334,0.5669,0.7262,12.4393,2.0602,6.6971,4.1851,0.802,0.6892,5.5655,1.4317,4.4093,0.0667,0.0017,4.9244,0.2717,0.774,6.0758,3.4686,0.3027,7.2241,1.795,2.1497,6.1825,6.5614,4.4047,6.6869,4.7984,5.4517,4.1239,1.4258,3.7573,3.5075,0.9167,1.7138,0.9034,2.6338,3.1965,3.6352,0.0071,4.4506,1.355,2.7503,0.2423,2.6637,5.6349,0.3756,3.5842,0.8445,7.1542,2.5605,2.8005,3.7316,3.5105,0.002,0.0369,2.7735,1.7112,0.3953,1.4016,5.0573,0.0062,1.5259,2.7429,2.11,3.0685,3.7761,3.5985,1.813,3.4057,0.987,2.5664,1.0528,2.8936,2.491,2.4599,1.9217,3.4791,3.0431,0.2318,0.0027,9.0615,7.2863,1.1024,1.1092,5.8039,4.9572,4.2328,2.6778,3.5151,5.9413,0.3253,1.8205,1.4877,1.8978,5.8136,1.8293,1.5736,5.0486,0.1236,0.0598,2.3379,1.4898,1.7359,2.006,0.4171,1.954,6.0949,0.2128,1.8734,1.4047,2.8105,2.2134,1.6575,3.4472,3.295,7.6542,1.625,2.8969,1.4718,0.6606,2.8406,6.8098,0.0167,1.4097,2.4598,5.1442,0.4528,2.0616,7.0235,1.7525,0.3377,1.3808,1.3848,1.8696,0.0229,4.3272,3.2702,6.8377,6.4785,2.0055,5.0476,1.3926,0.6366,5.3694,0.0395,2.8564,0.8802,2.7394,1.1285,1.8916,2.1698,5.8246,1.7598,0.0502,2.5571,3.2294,2.9692,3.2349,1.5354,1.3162,1.9291,0.0122,3.8713,7.1365,4.0939,1.7752,0.6622,2.6929,0.0108,2.0318,2.7471,1.263,1.7728,2.0183,1.3286,1.6704,3.4224,3.2699,1.6355,0.4593,5.548,4.8301,2.345,2.8817,2.3653,3.9489,0.6296,1.8092,0.7987,0.0124,3.8004,2.4169,2.8289,2.0034,1.398,1.3569,2.158,5.9214,5.6993,1.6705,1.6689,2.2379,0.0438,2.782,1.3799,2.2997,3.2044,3.5788,4.4703,0.378,1.1829,4.9686,0.0191,3.9866,2.0637,9.8419,0.2038,1.8002,2.8803,3.7989,1.5713,1.1757,4.9256,3.9296,10.8022,4.6384,1.5825,5.1428,2.9878,5.9241,1.298,6.8174,3.4121,6.083,8.3206,1.3461,2.0456,4.5124,4.3284,0.0199,4.6091,0.9031,0.7552,0.4556,5.949,0.828,1.8932,1.967,6.7275,3.4618,3.3708,1.6232,3.4816,1.1129,1.6858,2.5696,2.9415,4.1967,0.4344,2.4595,0.8936,3.8341,0.0058,2.0768,0.7838,4.2799,1.5999,5.2579,7.1431,0.4611,5.2045,0.0065,0.0525,0.7939,3.0097,0.2097,0.5397,0.441,0.9613,3.6825,3.5516,0.5026,0.3627,3.1603,0.8683,1.9782,5.3723,1.6999,7.5816,3.8226,2.3885,1.43,1.4877,1.576,2.2516,2.0945,0.865,6.2413,1.7593,5.1686,0.3894,2.8252,5.4739,6.6951,0.1261,0.0142,1.8841,2.0829,3.5507,1.4141,6.7032,3.055,9.6178,0.1552,3.1247,1.6879,7.6627,0.1856,0.5537,5.4202,0.301,1.0659,3.4781,0.5215,1.3702,0.897,1.6324,0.6536,2.7585,2.7937,1.7339,0.5859,4.0645,8.8518,3.7411,7.2085,1.3337,2.0734,1.9124,3.5469,0.6759,3.8763,0.1899,1.7133,0.3551,0.6471,3.0373,1.1225,3.5447,1.3898,3.4202,1.5181,3.5295,3.5521,0.4389,6.1379,0.0302,0.0001,1.0535,2.9311,2.5501,6.114,0.2902,0.0022,1.9693,6.9039,0.0295,0.8138,2.1917,2.7286,2.8638,0.2268,1.678,3.5583,7.0289,2.4779,0.0034,0.1194,3.248,5.0332,0.9812,0.6133,2.5844,3.8651,1.9345,1.2862,8.8703,4.6491,5.4248,3.0258,1.3725,4.4551,5.049,2.8237,2.9892,4.9399,0.9742,1.4814,2.5565,4.2485,0.3037,1.0419,2.2983,4.7445,2.6653,0.1554,3.3758,0.5955,4.3259,1.16,4.194,1.9074,1.6797,5.1758,1.1998,3.2935,0.0011,0.1634,5.7996,2.7676,5.1862,1.2291,0.2961,3.9543,2.8373,1.4382,3.3416,0.0113,2.6783,4.229,1.1568,1.8325,5.5957,0.9329,3.255,2.8942,0.0251,0.1547,0.8645,0.0722,0.1073,0.7459,1.9655,3.7608,1.3934,4.0024,3.5627,2.4084,6.3163,1.5697,1.2051,5.4838,4.393,3.0328,0.7455,2.4889,8.1832,3.114,3.2381,6.3238,9.9032,1.745,4.8985,1.9005,6.506,3.7783,3.1026,5.9153,3.7277,2.4295,4.5267,0.6888,1.304,1.6003,1.4692,6.0458,1.8265,1.7128,3.6901,4.1768,1.2283,2.5907,2.7711,1.6394,3.736,5.5431,4.9482,0.143,0.265,0.4512,7.7178,1.4114,1.1407,3.1647,2.5244,3.1349,0.4089,0.7428,0.2978,1.5596,2.2998,5.1416,1.6815,1.9822,1.3266,0.3831,1.1601,3.3536,4.7681,0.2867,3.8118,0.7085,1.8427,0.7291,1.7614,5.0443,1.9996,2.3794,3.1597,0.1581,6.2974,0.8025,0.7577,0.9563,4.5609,3.7692,0.4426]}

Both wrote works praising the scenery of the area, and promoted it to travellers in a way that was later taken up by professional writers, such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Johnson, John Keats and Walter Scott. There are also records of their involvement in commercial ventures, such as the opening of a boarding house called The Cottage in 1802, which still exists today.\nI have an interview today with The Fertile Mind\u2019s publisher, Kristina Schulman. Kristina is the editor of the site and one of the founders of the Institute for Creativity and Health in New York City. She is well-respected and well-liked in the creative industries. The Fertile Mind is a site for anyone interested in improving their fertility, while also living a life of creativity. And today I had the great pleasure of sitting down with Kristina and learning a wealth of information and ideas that we share here.\nThe purpose of this interview is twofold: first, to learn a little more about Kristina and the Institute, and secondly, to share valuable information on fertility in relation to creativity. And believe it or not, Kristina knows her stuff! The conversation was great and I hope you like it. But of course, you have the final word. If I have answered your questions or provided useful information, please put us to the test: tweet me PI:USER!\nKristina: \u201cI just don\u2019t write about it because I always think to myself \u2018What if I get pregnant?\u2019\u201d Because being a writer I know it\u2019s not going to happen\u2014or if it does, it might not be well written\u2026 which would not only make it look bad for me, but it\u2019s not a story that has any impact. So I just don\u2019t write about it like that.\nKristina: Because in the writing business you tend to have a number of projects at a time\u2013whether it\u2019s your job or freelance\u2013and you tend to have to work at that one project that you\u2019re working on at a time. And when you get pregnant it\u2019s just the best time to stop the work you\u2019ve been working on on a project and work on the new baby. It\u2019s a really great time. And in some ways for my job, I\u2019m still in my freelance writing for the Fertile Mind, but the reason I can\u2019t write about it the way I would like to is because I\u2019m in the middle of a project that I would like to finish before my due date and I just don\u2019t want to take the risk of going into labor and having to do it overnight. So I just kind of limit what I write about because it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t do.","token_len":619,"entropy":[10.3928,5.3528,9.746,16.4759,6.4798,6.6254,4.4013,7.9089,5.3374,1.3578,10.1708,1.2076,4.3064,2.3812,5.2904,0.4784,1.1773,4.2777,0.0727,3.5396,0.1806,0.0936,1.5153,5.5246,0.2279,10.2219,1.4432,1.3194,10.384,1.3353,0.8389,4.5393,5.5825,6.1334,7.1034,0.7429,6.9745,1.4174,0.8537,2.7704,1.3564,1.6127,7.7255,3.0868,2.5684,8.4655,3.3257,3.0868,1.523,0.3251,2.0803,7.5035,4.9921,1.675,0.3783,7.3424,1.7568,2.6891,1.2566,0.0009,3.0048,5.8964,0.0823,1.6669,4.7809,2.6986,0.3645,2.6387,4.9595,0.2118,1.2968,5.6488,1.2745,0.2515,5.4668,1.3116,2.2189,5.1695,0.275,4.1257,4.4343,0.4457,6.127,3.1972,1.2147,1.1848,0.0007,1.1825,5.1229,0.0445,1.2682,6.6441,0.7009,5.0673,2.5899,5.8937,1.0513,1.6578,1.4749,3.5197,1.3491,1.1557,6.3807,2.4274,0.3874,0.4659,0.7652,9.919,2.2904,5.0855,4.7568,7.5386,0.1385,6.2995,6.6545,5.2381,0.4596,9.2994,13.7342,8.0461,3.9162,5.9308,1.021,7.8129,2.345,5.1043,3.502,1.2549,1.2806,4.6449,0.0154,1.6519,1.8301,3.0524,0.4335,1.64,5.3421,2.0785,4.362,0.0334,0.4645,2.4448,0.1337,1.3545,5.5237,0.5438,9.0207,0.0253,1.1984,5.4984,2.7486,3.0225,0.1786,0.5983,0.3892,1.0701,1.4023,5.46,1.5464,3.9202,2.3481,2.6225,0.1845,2.6273,0.2181,1.5108,0.7117,5.5032,3.8169,1.2662,3.8957,1.6723,0.0034,0.0075,0.0128,1.1471,1.625,3.5674,1.8279,4.9971,0.8287,0.0125,5.6338,1.8821,8.3235,1.478,6.1002,1.5416,6.6561,1.7336,2.4035,0.9583,4.0288,0.6254,5.6705,5.9529,2.9266,5.1709,0.4225,5.3821,0.3198,0.2563,4.4126,0.1879,0.2431,0.2998,0.0035,2.034,6.5279,1.7706,6.6021,0.0082,0.7685,3.1283,4.1346,3.17,3.5203,4.3798,3.3018,1.2424,0.8609,3.0892,6.3742,0.0268,0.6257,1.331,0.3357,5.2013,0.1522,1.1685,0.8872,0.4221,0.3923,3.9045,2.8197,1.2284,1.34,0.0258,3.1631,0.0025,0.8367,1.9117,1.839,2.1665,0.3756,1.6013,0.3154,0.1167,2.5044,7.6843,1.176,2.7658,4.2256,3.4055,5.9708,0.0021,6.9387,0.741,5.1785,9.013,1.03,0.0013,0.0022,0.1301,2.5178,0.0016,4.5483,3.5138,1.2511,2.6452,3.689,5.6167,3.1117,5.1421,1.4895,1.7656,2.008,0.6535,4.0518,0.3271,0.849,4.747,6.639,0.0669,0.6483,2.8297,2.7347,3.253,5.6537,1.8588,1.4246,3.9413,4.1456,3.017,5.5398,1.6829,0.2725,3.723,3.8461,3.5767,0.4966,0.6153,1.0258,6.6292,6.8703,5.9852,1.6195,1.6017,4.7061,7.5997,1.8884,15.3057,5.3768,14.9368,5.9228,1.206,4.0691,0.0055,2.3833,8.4285,6.689,3.4625,4.065,4.6019,6.9144,3.8185,0.5551,6.2812,1.6079,3.5851,3.601,0.6297,6.8988,2.9355,5.9639,0.0283,3.9893,5.5283,6.3202,2.33,0.9311,4.5153,2.1579,1.2372,1.5095,1.7613,3.8978,6.3192,5.8023,7.0586,2.0126,2.2369,3.6456,2.8767,3.5693,3.0438,0.9132,4.1605,2.8653,2.8128,0.0517,0.9561,6.1868,3.8916,3.6872,1.1814,0.469,0.5874,1.5928,3.3787,1.3819,1.6164,6.7323,4.4101,5.8419,6.5291,3.4755,4.4026,3.3613,2.2208,1.345,4.0052,1.1977,4.1276,1.0003,0.6499,0.2232,1.3785,5.1735,0.226,0.5299,2.1738,3.0631,4.5161,1.79,4.2943,1.8312,5.1053,2.2721,2.2876,1.2622,2.6904,2.2693,0.9673,0.1787,0.0112,0.5679,0.1802,0.082,6.6877,0.4413,0.6009,1.7722,2.4035,0.0038,0.0242,4.7406,4.7035,1.7437,5.974,3.6085,2.5316,4.4687,0.0268,2.7083,1.3486,5.3123,0.026,5.7378,4.3886,2.7098,0.109,7.5811,4.7434,0.5098,2.5673,0.0522,0.2149,3.0671,4.9156,1.4884,6.954,2.6381,1.0937,1.1994,2.3838,0.042,1.678,1.9931,3.3815,3.8671,3.552,6.3144,0.6706,4.8789,1.183,7.0755,0.0721,2.3552,2.706,0.1639,2.2129,1.239,0.3724,0.5005,1.952,3.5983,0.4214,3.1948,1.9519,2.3031,2.7105,0.0071,0.0478,3.8058,3.5173,4.9117,1.6107,0.3519,5.8513,4.9448,2.1004,2.9415,2.5808,0.015,1.8176,0.5554,2.8047,0.0458,5.5335,2.5567,0.3079,2.5963,3.9041,0.483,2.6187,4.0421,5.4646,1.2294,2.8421,0.9846,0.0058,0.0379,2.6093,3.5059,3.2252,0.6687,2.2773,1.8869,3.8869,3.463,0.6982,6.1147,4.6826,4.3478,1.5669,1.1085,3.4437,0.0418,1.942,5.3063,3.8279,2.5827,6.8798,2.8222,6.0644,2.34,5.8481,0.1176,0.1086,0.0311,1.5805,1.3667,3.724,4.5568,0.5516,4.8853,1.9156,0.0345,0.0136,1.8233,0.6749,0.5084,5.5679,0.2024,0.4287,3.2161,1.1335,0.8767,0.68,0.1983,0.7854,3.7725,0.0101,1.0253,3.5172,1.8032,3.7131,0.0338,1.2029,2.885,2.1091,0.5759,3.6927,0.2654,0.0437,1.8207,4.4701,3.0059,6.1117,0.0883,2.7048,1.223,3.5477,1.5092,0.0672,0.0142,0.01,1.6613,0.1671,4.1978,2.0503,2.3114,0.7519,3.3165,2.6459,3.1379,2.2949,2.3941,1.0681,2.4895,1.5496,7.6593,0.5899,1.008,0.8701,1.7348,3.4557,0.0017,8.64,3.386,0.2251,2.5277,0.8552,4.2993,1.8985,1.0179,0.005,0.036,1.9426,3.7948,1.3837,3.3315,0.0907,0.0153,0.1229,2.8968,1.5745]}

In the Derby he ran prominently for much of the way on the outside to make a fast finish and beat the odds of 6\/1. He finished fourth, beaten nine lengths behind Van Diemen's Land. On 19 June he failed to respond in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. This was followed on 29 June in Queen Anne's Plough over the course and distance in which there was the possibility of placing but he was caught in the closing stages and finished a disappointing fifth.\nOn 10 July Tristan ran unplaced behind his older brother, Brockett Stakes. He won a similar race in August over the distance of 2000 on the flat. From 14 to 25 August he was sent to Leopardstown to contest his first Group 1 in the prestigious Epsom Derby. Tristan was sent four furlongs behind the leaders and after jumping well over the first furlong he jumped up three lengths on the inside as he tracked in the closing stages. Tristan looked set to win over the line but was overtaken by two other runners in the home straight. This was Tristan's first defeat as a two-year-old.\n\n2000: three-year-old season\n\nTristan began the 2000 season by being moved up in distance to contest the Golden Slipper. At Ascot he finished second to Prince Sultan, his sole defeat from his eleven Group 1 races. On 27 May Tristan was fourth to Albatros in the 2000 Curragh Cup in which both horses finished strongly.\nOn 9 June Tristan contested the 2000 Derby in which he finished narrowly beaten behind the American stallion, King Solomon. This was the only Derby he finished, after a second-placed finish at Haydock in the Curragh Cup. On 25 July he finished fourth behind Rookery in the 2000 Grand National. On 3 August Tristan won the Stayers Stakes on a course record time of 1'09\"5. On 21 October Tristan ran badly in the 2000 Royal Oak Stakes and finished third behind his older rival, Prince Sultan.\nFor the final month of the season Tristan was switched to the Curragh in which he contested the 2000 Eclipse Stakes. He finished fourth to Albatros. Prior to the start of the New Year Tristan had recovered from an attack of influenza and on 1 January 2001 he ran a course record time of 1'09\"3 (which later proved to be the meeting record of 1'08\"S) in the Millennium Handicap at Newmarket. He subsequently had several positive starts in the spring and finished second to the American filly, Princess Bride, in the 2001 St Leger, winning the 2000 St Leger at Leopardstown over the Irish Derby distance. The following month he started a seven-runner maiden at Aintree. Tristan finished second to Black Caviar to win the race.","token_len":619,"entropy":[2.5476,4.1163,0.1805,5.08,10.9777,2.7563,7.2911,8.7783,9.0834,5.1272,11.9587,2.6174,0.0345,3.5171,0.5472,9.8236,10.4626,1.9256,2.2766,4.6074,6.4338,3.2637,0.2135,1.7836,5.7837,2.7462,1.0158,0.4619,13.2849,6.563,1.3956,0.8863,2.88,1.8663,8.7442,1.4771,3.2586,11.6672,2.9751,7.5162,0.0409,0.261,7.3933,5.2838,0.8007,5.2414,3.9148,3.7857,2.083,7.3928,2.3968,2.7122,5.0613,2.9662,5.6827,2.7374,7.7407,3.3618,1.7524,1.3537,2.1161,2.6776,2.6629,3.5534,6.3833,7.4129,8.3956,4.0987,6.8459,5.8243,0.0818,2.921,10.1176,4.8464,4.5783,5.0438,2.3982,1.3025,6.1902,0.2039,6.8483,3.0574,0.9609,9.4269,0.1373,0.0005,7.2735,0.9627,2.2254,4.9041,1.2116,2.2685,3.5589,4.0025,0.4756,5.7626,9.3575,4.7687,2.2465,7.8381,1.5421,7.4582,1.7484,4.6962,7.7479,12.7873,3.8751,4.7184,5.8253,0.7481,4.6055,2.3628,0.2558,7.0035,5.9175,1.8536,1.5342,5.9803,2.405,1.1991,6.236,0.3778,2.2252,4.073,4.2322,3.9808,3.8791,0.5378,1.1467,8.2199,3.6177,1.1027,1.2323,0.0011,2.2905,4.5696,0.3825,2.4204,4.1889,5.2995,0.3267,2.346,9.5228,4.9763,6.6866,4.6774,1.4783,2.0001,3.5518,3.0575,6.9795,1.4186,1.3727,5.1787,6.5288,0.4495,6.8361,1.9569,8.8541,5.3418,1.0285,6.7444,4.3129,6.2501,4.6001,3.3492,4.4428,1.2212,0.7493,2.5691,7.0509,1.9842,12.2301,6.1647,2.6869,5.0756,2.2,1.5774,11.5355,3.4952,3.7655,1.3179,7.2255,8.4776,0.0178,3.2869,0.5463,3.1303,0.0004,2.2853,4.8199,6.7142,8.531,0.8333,0.1037,4.2202,2.3075,6.4779,2.2168,4.7151,8.8813,5.7568,2.1373,2.0299,3.8462,3.1281,0.0084,0.1175,0.8779,5.8538,3.7254,4.2362,1.4126,3.702,0.6824,4.3506,5.2183,1.445,8.8255,4.367,1.4228,3.8218,0.4632,0.5175,3.1427,0.0004,6.7301,3.7559,0.3658,2.3886,5.5314,1.3661,6.8711,1.7462,2.427,5.3704,0.0049,0.5869,4.3002,2.761,1.8716,2.4515,0.4987,8.5623,6.9273,1.0932,3.4903,1.5135,4.3868,0.0005,0.5349,1.3356,4.8698,3.6155,1.1092,6.9139,0.4757,3.8476,0.2022,0.0027,1.4232,0.8526,7.8463,8.7051,2.9794,9.4178,2.3543,2.3706,0.5523,0.0189,8.7142,0.5277,0.0002,4.3119,0.3051,0.0459,4.8221,1.8828,1.4082,0.3617,3.8336,3.9005,5.8728,2.2083,3.0737,8.1049,1.4783,5.4874,1.1496,9.3976,7.0524,1.9819,2.0396,4.0505,10.5206,1.5565,0.7154,2.3691,2.2927,2.156,6.8417,9.0837,2.1715,4.1697,8.0815,3.5933,5.3475,3.0434,8.279,10.2504,0.1736,2.0789,0.7941,3.0847,3.9558,2.781,1.2453,0.0007,2.2425,6.7741,3.0576,6.4694,6.7789,2.4154,2.0689,0.3724,6.7812,8.0535,5.4763,0.8574,3.7455,3.8804,3.8035,6.3364,4.5362,2.7331,6.2408,0.6565,2.8868,18.4684,3.4642,0.8334,0.8182,0.0004,8.016,1.0256,6.4672,4.0078,1.9802,3.5299,0.2547,1.6481,6.6866,7.6104,7.6216,2.0656,8.5323,8.3146,1.242,1.7655,5.4873,5.7186,0.606,3.0787,0.6317,2.2284,3.1371,6.3479,1.6005,2.4752,6.6818,4.1144,2.6103,4.5081,3.0237,1.7671,0.2862,2.141,8.5792,4.5343,1.6628,1.7028,1.2865,6.2492,0.012,0.0019,0.3918,0.9472,1.5663,3.8997,2.2998,0.7998,2.1452,2.2533,3.6719,6.9061,5.1135,5.0079,1.8519,0.1554,4.895,5.1007,4.845,1.0287,1.5092,3.4723,0.3387,1.4463,0.0002,2.9207,0.7482,4.7297,11.089,4.663,0.0262,3.5264,3.1289,5.5201,8.3917,4.1013,0.0948,3.1351,6.955,4.6771,3.7563,5.5174,1.1053,5.7769,4.2205,3.2511,1.2735,0.0003,2.0769,7.4074,1.2295,0.4757,6.5019,5.374,5.2971,1.8533,0.007,2.022,2.9145,2.5009,2.2493,2.7784,2.1858,5.4854,0.8356,3.2371,1.4631,0.3141,1.5507,19.3273,0.6953,3.4173,4.212,0.3337,0.7329,0.7431,0.9695,0.0002,1.9954,8.0594,0.802,1.5282,5.905,0.0459,0.0062,3.7834,2.2236,0.1297,6.503,1.1257,4.2957,11.1888,1.6283,0.0036,0.8288,1.6212,1.0835,2.3072,1.8698,3.8108,0.0497,0.0037,3.1626,7.4639,0.0037,0.9322,2.8358,0.086,0.2826,6.3013,0.2362,1.6813,0.0004,1.4123,7.6245,0.7215,2.6905,4.6859,2.4513,7.8697,1.2338,4.1412,2.755,1.4565,3.563,0.6222,2.2017,2.9448,6.3613,0.5522,0.68,0.0414,0.6894,0.0181,2.3256,0.2231,2.8846,5.7639,5.3735,6.7265,3.5789,0.7303,0.0203,1.7755,9.8341,4.3088,2.3526,3.4324,0.0332,2.5631,0.5135,9.4341,2.4878,1.5564,0.7278,7.1855,8.2394,1.6733,0.0308,3.0291,5.8738,3.3119,0.6309,2.0179,5.9477,3.9534,6.1276,7.2892,6.0502,1.2578,0.519,5.9316,1.2461,5.8001,2.2165,0.3832,2.6629,2.3366,10.1065,1.8748,0.9887,5.7481,7.1763,1.9227,1.29,0.2107,5.9489,3.287,10.8434,2.4799,4.6176,5.9428,1.1766,7.4371,3.1244,1.7287,0.0324,3.1678,11.2856,0.065,5.6569,0.3562,8.1304,6.8006,4.345,0.3779,3.5096,1.5667,1.9942,0.5387,4.408,2.5168,6.4313,0.2398,10.2725,8.9421,3.2552,5.9041,5.2575,0.447,2.1544,2.8489,0.0002,1.4858,2.0325,0.2751,8.0945,8.6108,3.1452,5.148,1.6678,0.3086,4.5332,1.5941]}
{"prompt":"In late 1943 , Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of improving the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion , expected to take place sometime in 1944","text":"In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of improving the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. He asked for the full range of military equipment from the various NATO countries and the United Kingdom. The British gave Rommel several ships, including four destroyers that were intended to defend the Atlantic Wall between Cape Blanc-Nez and Brest-Litovsk, north of France. While the destroyers were being delivered, a Polish submarine U-412 was carrying out reconnaissance and took photographs of the British fleet. This was an opportunity for a U-boat attack.\nA little later, in late March 1943, an Allied convoy carrying over three thousand tons of materiel across the Atlantic was bombed by U-boat U-412, with the intention of damaging the ships and damaging the convoys so the supplies could not be delivered. The convoy contained over a thousand sailors from the ships, including the flagship HMS Ark Royal. The attack damaged the vessel, and the crew was forced to make several attempts to stop the sinking. The U-boat sank, with the crew all but wiped out. The attacks on the convoy brought the Allied military back into the war, and the British began their campaign to cut off the German supply lines.\nWhen Rommel returned to Germany and learned of these U-boat activities, he sent a memo to British Admiral Richard Spratt, advising him about U-412, and about what he estimated to be the U-boats strength and strategy. The memo was invaluable to the British naval operations, because it informed the Admiral of the locations of the U-boats, and gave him a chance to plan to attack them, while the U-boats thought that they were being hunted. The British were already prepared, and within a few days of the attack, they had sent eight destroyers and a frigate to defend the convoys, protecting them.\nIn 1942, after the United States joined the war, American President Franklin Roosevelt decided to support the French in the war against Germany. This meant that America needed to increase shipbuilding to meet the increasing demand of the U.S. Navy. For this reason, President Roosevelt had two US ships build in France. These two ships, the acronym for them was SS Louisville and SS New Orleans, were named after the cities in Kentucky, and in Louisiana, the two major states that supported the war effort. A total of twenty five ships of all types were built there, ranging from light destroyers to battleships.\nOne of these ships was named after the city of Louisville, in Kentucky. The other ship was named after a city in Louisiana. Both are famous in the history of the United States and are very important for their roles in the war. The Louisville was built by the shipbuilder Newport News Shipbuilding Company.

Klimov wrote : \" the museum was not a success.In fact, most foreigners have come to Kaliningrad to see ships of the Soviet Union.\n\" In an assessment made about 10 years later, the Kaliningrad Shipyard Museum was rated the most visited ship museum in Russia.\nIn 1995, the Foundation of the Historical Society of Kaliningrad ( GSHK ) was established. The Society holds an exhibition every year in the museum's hall. As a volunteer organization, it has the task of maintaining and developing the museum.\nThe Kaliningrad Shipyard Museum has been part of the University's exhibition. The institution is located in the city of Kaliningrad and houses an archive. For centuries, it was an important part of the maritime trade. The museum has a complex of buildings with different functions. The ground floor houses the exhibition hall. The top floor is for storage, work space and library. The museum staff consists of employees and volunteers, including students, as well as a volunteer team of the U.S. Air Force. In addition to serving the museum, members of the U.S. Air Force also conduct research trips aboard the ship.\nThe museum maintains a separate collection of art.\n\nHistoric Ship and Shipbuilding Museum in Gdansk\n\nOverview\n\nThe Historic Ship and Shipbuilding Museum in Gdansk is located in a maritime environment, surrounded by many shipyards which have a long tradition in the maritime trade. The museum was established in 1995. A historical building from the 16th century has been used as the museum. Originally it was a fortress which had also served as a prison during WWI and WWII. This fortress was constructed as part of a project of the city's fortifications.\nThe building is located in the historic center of the city, in a place on the river Vistula where a number of shipyards were built. Many shipyards were built, not only for local needs at that point in time, but also for foreign markets in the 19th -early 20th centuries. Today, the museum contains an exhibition hall, the library, a photographic archive, as well as small offices in the fortress, and a small museum hall in the courtyard of the fortress.\nIn addition to displaying historic ships and shipbuilding, the museum also contains a section which focuses on maritime and transport technology, including maritime technologies which have been adapted for civilian use.

{"prompt":"The university 's teams are nicknamed the `` Tar Heels , `` in reference to the state 's eighteenth century prominence as a tar and pitch producer . The nickname 's cultural relevance , however","text":"The university's teams are nicknamed the `` Tar Heels, `` in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a tar and pitch producer. The nickname's cultural relevance, however, was challenged in a 1997 case, North Carolina v. USC that was ruled to be void because the USC brand is registered by its alumni with the United States Patent and Trade Mark Office. USC's trademark is protected over its nickname even though it is common knowledge that USC's nickname is `` Tar Heels, '' meaning `` ducks, '' according to South Carolina attorney. At stake was not only the identity of USC and its alumni brand but a fundamental principle of American university autonomy, an important principle for the independence and freedom of higher education ( USC vs. North Carolina v. SC 2000 ). Since the court ruled against the university brand it is unclear whether the controversy and the legal battle will ever be decided by a third party or whether the issue will eventually subside and the university will again be allowed to name its teams `` Tar Heels. ''. The name of the university comes from the name of the state. The initials were then added as a separate brand, named for the university that originated in the state at that time.\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (also spelled UNC or North Carolina State) is a public research university in the heart of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Unsurprisingly, it is a member of the NCAC, but it is also part of the South Carolina Research Association. UNC has the largest number of students in the state of North Carolina, surpassing South Carolina State.\nThe UNC Chapel Hill campus is located on the campus of the same name in Chapel Hill, NC. This university is located in the heart of the Research Triangle Park. The research triangle refers to the region's three largest research universities, North Carolina A & M, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. It consists of a population of more than 200,000, which is close to the population of the state of North Carolina. Chapel Hill is one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the United States with an economy that has a very high standard of living and is highly competitive in the field of higher education.\nThe university is part of Duke University, making its connection more direct to the world of science, technology, and research. The university is also part of the National Science Foundation, making it a leader in the fields of education and research. These connections make the university an ideal venue for training students, especially young researchers.\nUNC was founded in 1881 to serve as the first institution of higher education to open in North Carolina. In the beginning the focus was on business and chemistry, but today the university has a wide range of subjects and programs.

The most consistent symbolism in the film is an insect motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a swarm of small bees. The bees come to be seen as a metaphor for the young lovers. The symbolism is continued as the characters encounter numerous bees, many of which are the same as those in the main sequence. The bees are also represented by the girl\u2019s father, who sees them as a symbol of death and evil :.In a way, the bee motif can be seen as a symbol of Blue Velvet\u2019s central conflict: a young lady\u2019s love for a young man that may do her more harm than good. Although the bee motif is repeated throughout the film, some of the meanings the viewer ascribes to it vary. The bees are seen by different characters in various ways, and their appearance reflects the different social and cultural positions of the characters. For example, Laurie is portrayed as being very aware of the presence and symbolism of the bees. She is constantly worried about attracting bees, and she and Laurie\u2019s father keep bees to kill in a garden. The boys ( Bill and Charlie ) are also very careful to keep bees out of their garden, which is why they are frequently portrayed as being annoyed and even frightened by them. As a consequence of the symbolic value that the Bee motif has for a number of characters, it is a central focus for the narrative.\nBlue Velvet is a beautiful movie. This movie is a masterpiece. All the characters are well defined and have an appealing presence. The acting is exceptional. The director, David Lynch, uses symbolism in his movie. He presents different stories which, when taken together, help to establish the storyline of the movie. The story has a fantastic twist. My favorite character of this movie is Laurie. Laurie is so appealing and sexy. I am not supposed to love movie stars, but I am beginning to feel like I do.\nBlue Velvet was a wonderful film. I thought it was great to watch. I loved all the characters especially Laurie. She was so beautiful and talented. I liked that she and her father used some good techniques to help keep some bees out of their garden. I liked how Laurie and her brothers were all so nice and understanding and thought they were the heroes of the story. Blue Velvet is a movie which is hard to put down.\nI really liked Blue Velvet. The only thing I did not like was when Laurie was in bed with Ray. It was a short time, but I did miss the moment when the two of them were made into one person. I thought Blue Velvet could have been a little more exciting. There were a lot of scenes, which seemed a little boring.\nMy favorite part of Blue Velvet is the way that the people of the town were so nice and nice with Laurie. They would say nice things to her and would look after her. The people of the town was nice because they treated her like a human being even though she was so young and beautiful.","token_len":624,"entropy":[9.2208,3.3936,2.6914,4.4733,6.6202,4.4441,0.7755,9.9888,4.375,1.7148,2.251,4.4698,6.4299,5.0708,2.0485,1.1678,3.069,0.3227,4.1817,7.4293,4.1761,7.5229,3.8311,0.2519,0.766,0.404,0.4552,3.1171,1.6759,1.5288,3.7949,2.0458,4.6861,2.1177,0.0001,0.6128,0.516,1.2424,5.1879,0.0419,4.9598,3.1492,1.2471,1.5597,2.8777,5.1906,1.6251,3.6297,2.7826,0.7936,1.5967,4.4331,0.1992,1.0424,6.7496,6.3242,3.0536,1.862,4.7349,1.3519,6.9957,4.0267,0.9247,4.8529,5.6455,6.5267,3.2183,1.7684,3.5236,0.2914,0.8006,0.8232,4.418,1.7819,2.1679,2.0668,1.7732,0.4473,5.3588,3.6518,0.5407,1.6729,1.7861,1.1444,2.9224,4.008,1.592,1.6303,8.4054,15.9189,7.8468,2.9961,5.9773,1.086,1.2854,7.3852,0.9077,0.4618,1.6283,0.6444,0.2444,7.4552,1.3374,6.1397,11.0694,6.332,6.3081,3.4142,3.4704,0.2879,1.2598,3.4542,0.7004,4.517,0.5136,1.4866,0.3383,0.7115,2.7034,0.2143,7.8419,0.0078,4.1944,0.22,0.0325,7.5707,4.5298,2.7308,3.9054,3.3855,4.5457,7.328,0.0413,0.0816,2.8314,0.9114,2.167,2.2106,0.2433,3.7955,5.5259,7.5386,3.2964,5.0403,0.2961,0.1449,0.0202,0.6984,4.9496,1.1817,3.0218,0.2493,0.9319,5.0708,1.44,0.3088,0.2961,0.1819,5.1857,1.1337,0.2778,7.6075,5.5403,3.9482,6.7377,2.4201,0.1034,1.0443,4.5082,1.8996,1.7442,3.2597,1.1897,2.8165,4.9212,6.2541,1.4085,1.7771,2.5768,0.7354,1.0489,2.2177,3.4491,4.4494,4.8765,1.1211,3.8945,4.7327,1.5818,2.0853,5.6065,0.6387,0.6275,1.1602,0.5301,2.8706,0.3729,0.0612,11.8951,2.1863,2.8492,0.2292,3.0324,3.4772,5.9384,0.1429,0.9541,5.1903,4.1411,7.5297,0.1311,0.8712,0.6776,2.0562,2.6702,1.319,5.2592,5.3203,0.6256,8.0115,3.8801,1.2818,1.1228,2.2076,5.3401,4.5603,9.4268,0.0516,0.0961,1.6079,6.0516,3.2187,4.5039,7.802,4.9828,3.168,4.9971,1.0417,1.9935,8.0773,5.1828,12.4167,0.8525,4.4777,0.8897,0.8717,2.1211,3.8998,3.7101,1.9444,1.6145,0.7064,2.4867,0.2021,0.5233,2.8844,1.1302,3.6604,1.1853,2.7574,0.8403,1.7797,4.3707,6.3659,0.3125,2.0255,7.6995,2.2422,4.7415,3.4537,0.6421,1.4946,0.2442,3.9622,1.6232,3.1179,1.9093,1.392,7.7484,6.4394,3.5614,1.2192,6.0414,0.6049,1.7752,1.9717,3.9262,6.1727,0.0012,0.7324,0.4851,1.4517,0.8731,3.6437,4.0563,4.8567,1.9689,0.9042,5.5238,0.6257,4.0194,11.8756,0.0152,1.935,1.3079,5.4012,2.9582,1.2418,4.724,2.5176,1.0541,2.2479,3.1494,1.556,5.6499,1.3069,1.5123,0.9131,3.7632,4.8273,0.9953,3.7106,3.2905,4.6273,5.4309,0.9511,1.1056,6.0976,0.5855,4.7337,1.1297,0.711,4.656,2.181,4.0771,3.3775,0.2972,3.9514,7.4707,2.2244,1.8413,4.2478,1.6644,2.3358,5.0352,5.0083,5.1866,5.1141,4.6866,2.6993,3.8591,0.8145,0.1838,5.5127,0.7569,3.6721,0.6434,6.3677,2.0475,0.5447,1.3074,0.2522,1.2612,3.622,4.2776,1.3037,5.9989,4.9073,2.2551,6.6981,1.2725,3.6045,2.6695,2.8597,0.3571,0.2607,2.8165,1.1682,3.0391,0.65,4.9945,7.1626,1.6771,5.3617,1.5564,3.0342,3.3466,1.9784,7.9128,0.0042,3.5167,8.5714,2.2821,1.7145,0.4417,1.2205,2.2516,8.1892,0.0176,3.9086,1.9582,0.9864,2.5868,0.4801,2.3382,1.7006,0.0052,2.9518,2.032,3.9401,1.1811,0.5394,1.7125,4.5532,0.7225,0.4176,3.5994,3.7741,2.0753,1.4666,1.3651,2.7874,3.6114,0.5911,1.0557,7.3578,2.0753,0.5262,4.2003,1.6528,1.9511,2.0922,0.8143,6.3576,0.4545,1.384,3.6703,1.6764,0.9873,4.8359,1.5499,1.3474,5.0325,5.2197,6.1671,5.3869,1.1857,3.8524,3.9045,5.8536,2.0462,1.3371,0.2331,0.6272,0.499,0.2462,1.7271,2.8814,2.166,3.2485,2.6455,1.5627,7.2301,2.1244,4.9887,2.7339,3.5738,0.6201,4.8298,2.2717,6.1093,2.0241,0.5167,3.2258,4.3733,1.2075,0.4804,1.133,0.1491,4.9565,0.0015,0.9848,0.9135,3.19,3.0613,1.7566,5.8564,0.1408,4.1342,0.8114,0.7793,2.0682,2.8321,3.3108,1.9552,1.9721,0.0013,0.5429,2.2874,4.8621,1.6494,0.6758,2.8672,0.274,0.1323,0.8085,4.2742,3.4108,2.1361,3.4298,4.7996,0.852,9.4685,1.8753,2.7676,0.7728,2.0552,6.3526,3.5818,4.179,0.8034,1.0082,2.8279,5.6181,1.2228,3.945,0.3889,3.2238,1.9078,0.6502,0.0645,1.3332,7.9799,4.3119,3.0805,3.2373,0.4576,1.3778,3.4935,4.441,0.0016,3.6622,0.6621,0.5695,1.2335,3.0799,0.8477,4.8283,1.1685,4.3134,1.5061,1.7452,1.0383,0.0308,2.699,4.2927,3.6721,4.7268,3.0444,0.3375,3.7966,1.8296,2.6714,3.9388,1.2928,2.0968,0.3156,1.0912,0.0004,1.0128,1.43,3.3259,1.7605,1.2476,4.9186,1.2447,1.5848,3.0459,4.7967,4.3772,2.4678,0.8851,2.9898,5.5345,2.9513,0.493,2.5283,4.443,4.1908,3.5468,0.0345,1.3294,1.1818,1.4353,4.2309,5.2875,2.1313,0.0839,0.9222,2.5506,2.1285,0.8712,1.0424,0.0813,5.0517,3.5756,5.0881,0.6652,4.9542,0.5922,1.4885,0.7398,1.9032,0.2035,7.3607,0.3887,0.3875,0.4846,4.0993,1.7862,1.3078,1.3164,0.1669]}

This has led","text":"The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led to a number of scholars who have argued that Sirhan fired three bullets before he was shot. This has also led to the hypothesis that he ran after Kennedy along the road between the pantry and his house while Kennedy was attempting to cross from west to east.\nIn his book of 2007, \" The Execution by Sirhan Sirhan,\" writer and historian Mark Kurlansky writes that the killing took place somewhere along a section of the road which crossed from west to east. While Kennedy had been standing on the west side of the road, some witnesses said that Sirhan fired into Kennedy. Kurlansky points out that some witnesses described him as having a shotgun, while others said that he fired with a knife. His source for the last suggestion is the story of one of Kennedy's victims, Harry Kessler. Kessler testified (on April 18,, 2007) that it took two or three bullets for Sirhan to dispatch Kennedy.\nThe shooting took place on the morning of June 7,, 1961. Most of the details in the account written in \"The Execution by Sirhan Sirhan \" occur prior to the shooting. However, it is noteworthy that Kennedy was seen running from west to east on the day he was murdered. The section of road between the pantry and the Derry house was paved with red concrete and the distance from the pantry to the Derry house was about 1 kilometer. In addition, the pantry lay directly to the west of Kennedy's house. The murder occurred at the corner of the road at approximately 10:00 o'clock in the morning. This area was full of people. People were leaving the house after having breakfast. Some were leaving the pantry. Some were leaving the Derry house which is located to the left of the pantry. Witnesses told Kurlansky that as Kennedy crossed the road from west to east, there were other people coming from the direction of the Derry house. The people who came from that direction were some of Leland's friends and family. The murder apparently took place near Kennedy's back, meaning that Kennedy may have been shot standing up. The shooting, however, may have occurred while Kennedy was turning around to approach Sirhan. The fact that Kennedy had a shotgun raises the possibility that if he had been shot lying down, he may have been able to draw a shotgun and kill Sirhan.\nAccording to Kurlansky, the murderer did not move to attack Sirhan after the shotgun blast, but instead turned around at that point and faced west, where Sirhan was firing. When he turned he may have been able to reload the shotgun. He may have walked up behind Kennedy which may have caused Kennedy - who was walking north along the road with a shotgun in his hand, and a gun with a clip of cartridges dangling from his belt, - to stop or slow down to the point where Kennedy may have been able to see the murderer.","token_len":624,"entropy":[8.3462,0.7194,9.8417,0.9794,9.614,8.4482,1.1051,3.0962,5.2422,1.3884,8.4598,4.0054,1.0285,1.5933,2.7211,5.937,2.194,1.1403,1.9871,11.2821,2.2696,8.8073,9.5272,4.1615,4.0749,4.4481,4.1004,0.3798,11.1603,0.1605,9.4882,2.288,0.4531,5.0014,5.4738,2.251,1.0255,3.7581,3.5202,0.0007,8.6869,4.2379,1.6133,3.2646,0.126,2.0149,0.0002,7.3324,3.8863,3.682,4.0923,2.0637,0.9315,0.8256,0.7713,3.9089,2.4846,1.1002,0.4944,0.3394,1.9552,4.1139,0.0363,2.5643,5.7354,3.7799,1.073,7.3834,0.8423,3.5792,4.9143,1.6919,5.7387,0.0163,0.0847,3.7926,2.9226,4.9503,4.088,0.2491,4.8247,0.0526,3.6608,5.206,2.9746,0.2523,0.1452,0.4196,1.0644,9.0,3.1796,2.1603,5.5115,10.8988,1.102,2.3074,5.775,5.5773,5.2795,6.9575,0.0084,5.0412,0.0167,3.8354,5.4225,2.2327,1.339,4.6483,4.6821,5.1506,0.7083,2.6283,0.9835,2.1551,4.4154,4.1764,0.0016,6.8204,2.1562,3.8311,5.3665,0.0431,0.9867,1.6314,4.4842,7.7337,2.8815,1.2434,0.099,0.1171,1.0156,4.7006,4.7224,2.6089,1.5734,3.1837,1.6386,0.3748,3.7333,0.3453,0.1491,0.1452,0.638,0.74,5.1418,0.7144,1.1592,0.4965,0.9439,0.0002,3.2422,4.6987,1.991,4.4503,2.9415,0.0014,0.0024,3.9266,0.1701,0.097,4.0509,1.5836,3.3515,3.4371,1.5056,2.5203,1.2327,5.0031,2.5576,2.8791,0.131,0.9861,0.5956,0.57,2.7983,4.0816,0.4797,3.8215,0.4978,5.0679,7.075,2.159,1.8615,6.173,6.8885,0.6847,2.173,5.2427,0.6484,3.9294,1.2253,2.8168,0.0043,2.969,0.623,6.4713,9.4796,1.4797,3.1586,4.8335,7.621,4.0952,5.497,3.4152,11.0495,2.2202,0.2915,0.1219,5.4816,2.5511,3.5577,2.3312,0.0344,2.5779,2.0796,2.4847,0.0002,0.073,8.0583,1.9806,1.9224,1.8733,2.6627,3.6627,3.0878,0.0014,1.7654,1.1448,3.1031,0.0872,3.2009,3.1868,8.7863,6.3651,1.0818,7.0922,0.9432,0.231,6.7498,2.8336,1.1336,2.9955,6.362,2.873,4.4814,1.3288,0.3799,0.3642,0.0299,0.0002,0.0321,0.0001,6.6071,7.0554,5.2063,0.0026,0.8064,1.8168,0.8506,2.9345,0.0179,2.4632,0.5289,4.1159,0.1188,3.1106,1.2755,3.5628,2.1672,2.1355,2.909,0.0939,0.0819,2.3528,0.4094,3.4546,3.2827,0.3906,4.3096,0.5585,2.3507,7.4166,0.2722,1.8846,3.0864,0.6767,1.4314,0.0038,0.0586,1.4651,8.4765,4.6146,2.7147,1.8732,6.3441,0.6208,4.1136,4.4332,1.6808,2.4026,6.9293,1.5096,0.5394,3.0964,0.0015,0.2247,0.2967,1.8763,0.0031,0.5627,0.5119,1.7851,2.938,4.1896,0.233,0.2606,3.2174,1.5916,0.3934,1.2045,5.1396,0.0024,6.5232,3.6315,3.9275,0.2446,2.0578,0.1688,2.3899,0.2036,1.0593,0.852,1.9657,5.3375,2.5748,2.1065,2.2853,3.2871,0.0142,1.817,2.0658,4.3546,3.9774,2.8067,0.2366,1.7397,5.9159,0.0524,0.0011,2.1084,0.019,0.4586,1.0919,3.7938,3.1331,1.2949,6.6126,0.0157,1.942,2.3662,5.3937,1.3885,4.7967,1.0462,2.9139,3.6874,5.0443,3.934,1.4368,3.8455,3.4094,3.2081,1.4435,1.2995,0.0027,3.2805,2.2893,0.6025,2.0222,0.4744,1.4225,0.01,0.4606,6.2226,2.4421,3.3466,4.6818,0.0253,3.4734,0.1316,0.4104,2.6432,0.0022,0.4777,6.2573,3.0875,2.626,0.0263,0.0026,0.2223,5.117,1.0074,4.8113,0.6705,1.3295,2.0892,0.3632,0.0496,0.0194,0.5883,3.6384,1.4613,5.277,0.7138,4.5409,1.8872,0.7402,3.269,0.3673,0.5803,2.0927,0.0054,0.2975,0.4988,2.3694,4.7299,1.79,2.5819,0.8521,3.9112,0.0216,1.2621,5.0272,0.435,10.3113,4.1942,1.3239,2.1667,1.8294,2.012,0.5222,2.2508,4.8293,6.533,0.5537,0.001,3.5074,2.7651,0.1269,5.762,2.7215,7.5565,0.1205,2.7624,3.8294,0.0696,0.9318,2.334,8.6817,3.6259,1.4107,2.2898,3.9792,4.5115,1.7403,0.0194,3.4108,0.2685,2.3593,4.0624,1.3439,0.0892,7.1283,2.7141,2.2826,5.2842,3.8357,0.0016,0.8423,2.1566,3.8914,0.0423,1.2736,2.434,2.8069,0.8409,7.211,1.1148,0.4934,0.0667,6.0862,1.8051,0.3587,2.0162,1.9213,6.7381,2.4679,0.839,0.7781,1.6016,0.0641,1.1176,2.1159,0.0053,5.1991,2.4353,3.6358,2.1369,2.9987,0.664,0.0001,0.665,1.093,3.8143,0.0047,2.1302,0.0042,0.0013,0.2059,1.5365,5.4233,4.0292,0.1504,4.3357,2.6822,3.6839,1.2051,0.0002,4.4997,1.308,7.3587,7.8477,2.0555,0.6866,2.298,4.2151,0.6279,4.1632,4.3772,0.9377,1.5082,5.6923,1.12,2.7801,2.6185,1.4438,0.0001,0.9424,6.1086,1.4131,4.5214,2.4923,1.6536,6.1855,5.7836,0.03,1.2364,1.5298,0.003,6.2974,1.3784,0.9982,1.597,3.4135,1.3623,0.1959,5.7513,2.5565,4.0459,0.5782,5.6388,2.1005,0.1539,3.6408,2.331,10.2228,1.5905,0.7874,4.5531,4.6942,4.7098,0.1074,0.5766,3.2259,3.0973,1.5567,1.698,0.2339,0.6076,4.0163,2.9177,3.8069,3.4443,4.5864,0.923,4.2538,4.905,7.4384,7.3753,0.5371,1.3527,3.0085,2.8258,4.7152,0.0537,4.0757,4.887,5.7344,0.191,3.4518,2.9741,3.7595,0.5001,2.8622,4.9496,0.0391,1.086,0.8811,0.0046,4.0555,2.1181,4.049,0.9998]}

Traditionally , the","text":"The rector is chosen by the governor of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo from a list of 3 candidates elected by the university's community, including students and administrative staff. Traditionally, the rector is from the \" political party of the government \" and has a short residence term of 2 years. During his tenure, he must take the exam of regrateship, which examines the candidate's political and academic skills. This requirement of the exam leads to the rector's decision to stay in the university rather than resign, thus making the tenure process more stringent. Usually the governors appoint \" a professional \" to assist the rector, who is responsible to fulfilling the administrative tasks and reporting directly to the governor. If the rector should resign, the governors appoint a temporary rector, called interinato.This interinato may sometimes be more than one year.\nThe university staff, of which the rector is the head, consists of professors, researchers and administrative staff, as well as students. The University has a constitution written in 1987, and is the last to be registered with the state as a public institution of higher education. It is the only one in S\u00e3o Paulo to have a \" school \" of architecture, which is known as Escola Polit\u00e9cnica de S\u00e3o Paulo ( EPUSP ). The school includes the two largest universities of architecture in SP, both from the State University of S\u00e3o Paulo ( USP ), the universities of S\u00e3o Paulo ( FEUSP ) and Campinas ( UNICAMP ).\nIn addition to the two buildings, the main campus features a botanical garden, which features an arboretum containing a very rich collection of plants of all continents. Also an ecological area is considered in the plan of the urban development that will be included in one of the proposals for the new development of the campus.\nOther campuses of the university are:\n\u2022 In S\u00e3o Paulo ( capital city ), Campus S\u00e3o Paulo ( CASP ) \u2022 In Vinhedo ( SP ), campus Vinhedo.\nThe campus consists of a central building of about 12,000 m2, with a number of laboratories and lecture rooms. The main building is designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer and was constructed in 1970. The building is one of the main buildings of the university campus, and is named after Niemeyer.\nFor the past few years, the university has maintained a very good performance in national surveys, especially in the ranking of the World University Rankings, and a relatively low profile in international rankings. The main weakness of the university lies in the poor performance in scientific publications.\nThe university has 3,700 undergraduate, 1,400 graduate, and 400 post graduate students enrolled as full time students and an enrollment of 10,000 students in undergraduate studies.\nThe universities were organized as a network of institutions in 1997 with the name Rede Universidade Nove de Julho, or RNN ( which stands for Rede Nove de Julho de Universidades ). The RNN is formed of the following 11 institutes :","token_len":625,"entropy":[8.0169,4.5582,2.9923,6.1144,1.2216,0.9089,6.4814,2.5304,0.6219,2.9738,1.2697,7.4341,0.8891,0.0471,5.0346,2.0768,1.1476,0.1741,5.594,2.1078,5.31,0.674,0.4967,7.6404,1.3869,4.2488,3.6653,3.7269,4.0476,1.5507,8.4665,0.5667,0.427,12.33,0.0211,0.2442,1.2177,1.0947,0.0119,1.309,6.9838,1.1344,5.7296,12.9119,1.4945,1.8295,0.4492,5.0713,1.7535,2.1635,3.2369,1.9623,5.9752,7.4699,2.3676,1.9375,3.4464,0.2391,0.4855,5.2112,1.2407,1.7661,0.3687,1.3743,5.8194,4.2657,2.1977,5.8967,3.6792,8.9048,15.2078,8.9795,2.361,1.4001,8.9983,1.158,4.7117,0.1848,2.8971,2.6848,3.567,3.7863,0.7516,4.45,4.4419,4.5311,1.6518,3.9302,5.7818,0.1446,1.5648,1.7219,0.0024,1.6399,3.9975,0.532,4.1812,0.6716,0.9314,1.5386,6.0425,0.0071,3.4732,3.0107,4.0179,2.6535,1.4381,5.9719,2.4926,1.4289,6.1437,0.4206,8.0495,2.1446,10.024,3.6269,6.0533,7.4667,6.1757,1.774,1.9571,5.9502,1.2824,0.2767,0.0005,2.7565,1.5727,1.4663,3.1178,3.6223,11.7535,0.7173,6.2174,3.0535,3.2379,7.6807,4.603,0.0745,0.1441,2.4477,0.4323,4.8854,0.5446,0.4633,0.0003,8.3957,1.7704,0.638,0.7459,5.5067,2.3354,0.9735,5.465,2.8005,0.0002,1.9827,6.7556,9.6649,8.0509,5.6686,2.1041,8.0304,3.3275,0.0777,0.0238,4.5782,7.2988,0.7119,4.757,2.2933,2.525,2.5111,1.551,3.0778,9.4736,4.2408,6.9759,3.6652,5.0193,1.5528,0.9996,0.4885,0.001,0.3033,1.2542,2.8397,0.3302,4.7788,0.1463,4.4826,0.6742,3.8566,1.2799,4.0101,0.437,2.2732,2.3537,0.0298,0.0025,2.5134,1.503,1.1488,4.968,3.3619,1.4974,7.8895,5.8075,1.4978,7.4674,1.8089,2.2431,2.3526,2.769,5.1282,4.5791,2.5858,4.8617,2.6292,0.1517,1.3057,4.3852,0.2632,3.0153,2.2184,3.0039,0.0451,0.4359,0.2723,2.7647,0.8745,1.985,1.2973,2.8862,2.0134,3.392,0.0006,0.0003,1.6545,0.8006,1.0029,3.8622,5.77,1.5078,3.2852,7.5439,1.1501,3.5524,1.1909,5.2084,0.5975,11.1533,4.7551,9.9275,2.5443,0.4543,0.6195,1.3568,1.459,0.0138,0.0032,1.2767,12.4346,5.8937,2.4775,0.9233,1.258,1.9593,5.2074,2.5858,5.4836,3.5104,2.4474,1.6936,2.8123,1.2986,10.1623,1.5326,5.441,4.5234,1.0071,5.443,4.0563,0.0618,0.7922,0.0008,0.0009,1.1023,8.9826,0.4666,0.9812,2.5523,6.0233,0.1657,2.6077,0.0084,0.0093,1.7914,8.349,5.6895,0.1279,0.9016,0.0538,7.1629,1.0031,1.3475,7.264,6.2729,5.9011,0.3636,1.6086,3.1367,2.6543,0.2558,0.6574,4.0555,6.1836,0.9015,0.5691,4.5797,1.934,5.058,0.9132,8.8167,0.0319,0.1854,0.6644,3.1718,4.7642,2.9802,4.5103,1.1256,0.084,0.0001,6.8631,1.6445,7.4824,4.6837,2.1621,0.0049,1.9072,4.5782,1.8205,8.6461,0.9858,4.7636,6.4155,6.5387,4.1237,0.8481,6.2276,3.9116,0.7463,6.3879,2.1692,0.4185,7.4195,2.6501,4.3468,2.1179,1.3809,4.9649,0.5334,7.7805,0.2643,0.1013,6.0146,2.3783,0.4258,2.7865,4.0913,1.7898,0.3047,1.6757,0.3644,1.016,5.496,5.4865,2.1343,1.3731,0.7474,2.1427,1.8843,1.1828,4.7458,5.5861,3.4153,0.0033,0.006,3.5842,8.9942,2.9191,1.6321,6.9083,3.3747,0.2968,0.1519,1.2409,7.5772,1.0992,1.3688,5.4372,2.2437,10.3857,12.4355,2.5284,0.9538,6.8465,1.0827,3.2735,4.5581,0.0109,0.0052,5.5763,1.24,1.7606,2.9407,3.6703,0.0721,1.9669,4.9906,2.9152,3.6495,4.4371,4.0652,1.1804,0.226,2.773,0.8404,1.2843,1.6245,1.0996,3.4413,0.0217,5.7723,1.2222,6.1088,2.6908,0.7854,1.0436,1.7794,1.8529,0.9414,4.6539,1.3651,3.3051,7.5567,8.5058,0.7256,1.4738,0.0096,1.5916,3.5429,2.7413,0.6827,5.3643,1.2125,1.0861,1.6339,1.1457,4.2434,0.0434,0.2569,3.4492,2.007,0.5058,0.292,1.0588,5.8503,1.1292,1.5343,1.3139,4.2143,0.7275,4.3611,0.0232,0.0013,0.0019,1.1972,1.145,4.7331,1.5102,3.7229,3.5041,0.1801,0.3998,0.481,1.1777,0.3022,4.1887,0.8753,4.2717,3.2661,6.0049,1.6029,6.2408,5.0908,1.6311,3.6114,1.2718,1.092,6.8994,0.2079,1.1167,6.2534,1.0963,0.1321,1.882,2.1474,3.9499,5.3992,1.8619,4.9344,0.6805,1.7881,3.117,0.3707,1.5242,4.9204,8.0176,0.5524,0.3366,0.5068,4.6175,0.1366,0.6865,4.6005,1.9789,2.4913,5.7438,4.5531,1.2036,1.7871,1.2213,1.0631,1.4778,6.4146,2.2997,4.1233,3.301,4.5533,4.7134,0.0046,3.0194,0.1596,1.9487,0.6954,4.3867,0.9847,5.1461,0.2608,4.5755,4.7405,5.1256,3.0379,1.9134,3.7305,5.9959,4.0253,0.2843,4.2599,0.0654,0.3291,1.332,2.695,4.2391,2.9192,0.5058,1.9676,0.9522,5.403,4.4014,5.1745,2.9014,1.7521,4.6872,0.4934,3.263,2.4385,5.0416,3.7542,1.0446,7.3382,10.3821,1.7341,4.8933,2.0926,0.0241,4.3198,7.4563,8.0857,10.9855,7.4762,1.9761,3.041,4.2392,7.5725,2.6871,7.2855,2.6235,0.0027,3.344,0.5823,5.4711,0.1413,1.8181,0.4193,0.0225,5.6414,3.145,0.0904,3.8111,8.5759,1.0119,2.0213,0.0028,1.2741,5.5281,1.5129,1.9528,4.1322,7.0878,3.9218,0.001,4.3578]}

The","text":"The video begins with Beyonc\u00e9 dancing in front of a target before moving to her putting on blush and lipstick next to two other men in a room full of neon framed mirrors. The video ends with the group singing the song's title as the lights flash.\nThe music video and accompanying promotion garnered much attention for the song's catchy hook, simple lyrics and the showcasing of Beyonc\u00e9's vocal talent.\nWith two weeks left in the 2016 US presidential election, there is an increased focus on climate change and the debate over whether the country is making good progress on this issue.\nThis week, as part of its campaign for Donald Trump, US retail giant Walmart donated US$1 million (S$1.3 million) to climate change groups, including Greenpeace.\nThe donations came as Walmart announced it would stop buying products made with palm oil, a controversial oil obtained from the pliable fruit of the oil palm tree, which is favoured for producing biodiesel.\nThe move puts Walmart in line with its rival Target and other chains such as CVS Health and Patsy's, which have already adopted a ban on palm oil products to combat deforestation.\nWalmart's decision to stop buying palm oil products is a step in the right direction, but there is still a lot left to do to solve the ongoing problem of widespread illegal deforestation in South-east Asia. To do so, global action needs to combine both the power of consumers and the commitment of businesses.\nIf consumers are to change the face of the climate problem, they will need to consider what products they buy, and make their purchases accordingly. The most significant of these decisions is buying in local stores, but consumers must also understand where their food comes from and how it is raised.\nThe food industry needs to do more to eliminate the damage done by the widespread and destructive practices of palm oil companies using child labour and other human rights violations.\nThe problem with palm oil is that palm oil plantations are in some cases less than 10 metres from the homes of families already struggling to make enough income to feed and clothe their children. This is one of the reasons that palm oil companies are often heavily criticised for their human rights abuses.\nAnother issue that has plagued the palm oil industry, which is also the focus of many of the world's climate change campaigns, is oil palm's contribution to climate change. While it can be labelled more environmentally-friendly than other oil sources, the fact that oil palm trees need large amounts of water, as well as pesticides and other chemicals, has seen it branded as a carbon emission hog.\nAt this stage, while it is good that Walmart is doing its part in the fight against climate change by eliminating palm oil products from its supply chain, the company could do a lot more to ensure its supply chains are not contributing to deforestation. Some of the biggest palm oil suppliers are in Indonesia, and this country has seen record deforestation in recent years.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on October 20, 2016, with the headline 'Moving towards zero emissions?'.

The Souths have played in every single ARC competition since 1995 when they moved from the competition's predecessor, the West of Scotland Cup. The competition is divided into four divisions, and the Souths have won the league titles in all four divisions (see below).\nNorth Queensland have finished second in the competition's most important title (the Premiership) once (in 1997) and third twice (in 1994 and 2007). Since the club has been in the ARC the Souths have finished second four times and third twice.\nCurrently, the Souths make up Division West of the competition. They are currently based in the club's first home since their moving from Stirling to the new Stadium of Light in 2000, where North Queensland have their training facilities.\nHistory\nThe Souths were formed in 1905. As a club they are one of the oldest rugby sides around. The only surviving football club in the Brisbane City Region, the club was formerly called the Fenians because many players were from St. Pats, formerly a Catholic district, but today they are one of eight former Catholic schools still involved in rugby league.\nThe Souths made their first ever AFL fixture in 1933 against the Richmond Rangers and the only time they did not make a fixture it was because of World War II, which began in 1939.\nOther notable players and coaches\nIn the early years players such as Ted McCormick ran up half scores, while others such as Ron Wilson and Ian Gibson, gained the reputation as the most dangerous players in Brisbane. Jim McLean, the original manager, was a former rugby union referee and coach of the Brisbane City Reds.\nBy the late 1970s the club had been in and out of the Australian championship and, with the assistance of former international captain Jeff Kennon, won the Australian national championship in 1978, earning the right to participate in the 1987\u201388 International Tournaments.\nIn 1989 the club signed player\/coach Eddie Jones, the most successful coach in modern club rugby league. In 1989, 1990 and 1991 the Souths compiled records as one of the best sides in the league winning five consecutive national championships.","token_len":627,"entropy":[9.555,9.2379,4.2335,0.6902,0.0924,0.1771,3.4962,7.9945,9.0649,2.3409,3.8807,12.1474,10.4969,0.1082,0.9208,0.5417,2.5838,9.822,7.1012,6.8381,3.2649,0.2717,3.6964,9.1526,5.9676,6.8574,2.6287,0.0251,0.0025,0.0029,1.7045,4.6474,4.0661,0.2267,0.7379,7.7632,0.0882,1.1173,5.6959,1.2339,2.7314,1.7582,0.3983,9.5498,0.174,0.0022,0.0237,1.2658,3.2581,0.4268,2.4854,3.6185,0.0432,0.0862,6.445,1.379,0.0081,0.0019,0.0006,0.2919,2.8753,0.7817,0.8137,0.38,0.6276,1.6354,4.8274,2.9159,0.0424,0.0476,3.9312,0.0296,4.2526,10.0903,6.8359,0.3792,0.1177,2.6814,0.2653,0.2969,6.1593,0.0053,0.0012,0.0017,3.0605,1.0775,0.2058,0.0291,0.0661,1.9097,0.2583,3.6236,8.6882,6.1927,5.2437,2.6799,1.8572,0.0675,0.0296,0.0328,2.4023,0.8151,0.4942,0.5111,0.2168,6.9587,0.0496,3.3818,2.2623,6.3795,0.007,0.002,0.0011,1.1016,1.5397,0.1091,1.108,2.0406,1.5611,6.8431,7.1015,2.6383,1.9231,0.3293,2.7184,0.1136,0.025,0.0201,1.2751,4.9778,0.0088,0.7436,1.7099,2.7791,0.0023,0.0015,0.0011,0.4737,1.6897,4.4362,0.0491,0.0605,1.7022,0.3266,0.0018,0.0035,0.0011,0.0436,1.0845,0.2539,0.0737,5.5223,0.0023,0.0027,0.0019,0.7027,3.0142,0.0115,0.0062,0.0189,0.8749,0.1459,0.3765,0.9054,0.1372,3.4778,13.3337,0.1836,6.4061,3.5301,4.2129,0.0317,5.1851,4.946,7.3651,0.0772,0.6609,3.1433,0.8993,5.3259,2.3614,5.5468,0.8648,0.6427,1.7057,4.2073,1.8636,0.0137,0.1098,2.1157,1.8686,5.0842,0.2273,8.8755,7.5576,5.7355,1.5845,0.208,1.9726,5.0655,3.8375,3.4171,3.2319,2.2067,3.687,5.1911,3.4584,2.6477,1.8449,3.9403,5.7485,0.3493,5.0989,2.478,1.2625,5.8367,2.2538,7.7305,1.1396,0.7985,4.7021,6.913,3.3047,4.2016,0.8977,1.8115,3.2212,1.8043,5.0851,0.1368,1.7313,1.3329,1.3405,3.3317,1.8249,3.3213,0.1354,1.7968,1.49,2.1114,4.6247,3.3597,1.6573,2.1812,1.0205,1.2,3.4356,4.945,1.469,0.3943,0.9992,1.7259,0.026,1.5485,5.212,2.3417,0.7322,0.5258,3.1993,2.5818,5.1795,4.6739,5.0646,2.8225,3.0327,4.4359,1.2495,7.2801,2.8548,3.4879,2.5905,1.2779,0.4977,1.7023,3.7364,0.1958,0.0999,3.2096,0.7577,5.4565,0.4712,5.1431,2.0233,4.621,4.1508,2.0219,2.0178,0.6733,3.7208,4.5451,2.6382,0.0646,0.1502,2.9542,1.9579,6.3403,0.0642,2.0201,1.9736,2.0117,1.198,0.9453,6.9728,1.6595,0.8616,1.5038,0.046,5.6966,0.4777,10.273,9.3085,1.5477,0.6766,2.3294,1.6808,2.7953,1.3611,2.637,7.0809,0.3146,1.7698,7.0081,0.0913,4.0403,4.1469,7.4634,4.3361,7.2885,1.7618,5.9407,2.9089,3.1186,1.9944,4.5416,5.264,1.0401,0.5139,0.7548,4.5473,2.2969,3.5591,5.0023,0.1049,1.4789,5.6937,5.4277,3.0272,0.7623,0.6903,6.4398,0.7673,1.7503,1.8514,0.0332,2.0379,2.783,0.6185,5.4049,2.905,4.1317,1.2162,2.7735,1.4443,4.1595,2.6066,0.0154,0.3563,1.4552,3.5103,5.9854,6.4508,1.3217,1.789,5.8384,7.6507,5.8556,0.7104,0.8222,0.7762,6.6583,4.6461,3.2803,1.2823,1.1777,1.3215,2.167,6.4139,2.7563,0.8048,10.0904,4.3488,6.6272,6.7018,3.8099,1.7091,2.6784,4.5635,4.2419,8.2189,2.536,6.33,3.6291,4.3843,7.4951,2.9272,2.4343,4.7563,1.8259,0.804,3.687,0.0075,7.9847,6.9677,2.8769,3.519,5.4239,6.3008,0.3405,2.2811,1.757,0.4154,0.8098,1.4722,2.0353,0.0578,4.4503,0.6469,1.8101,5.1254,5.0854,6.2105,0.6274,5.8618,3.0631,0.9947,5.1382,7.5837,3.1732,2.8157,4.7546,3.2653,0.8826,4.1958,2.682,2.6478,2.1573,6.6349,7.0981,0.1527,7.1111,0.7728,7.0744,0.4398,0.6964,2.8331,2.4754,4.7257,0.8844,2.8654,0.3508,1.2617,7.342,2.4373,2.8008,4.478,3.6972,1.7478,3.2732,2.0581,2.223,1.9418,6.2394,1.6259,0.0015,7.0098,8.1428,0.547,8.5102,4.7904,8.9565,7.8419,2.6315,3.3482,4.288,0.6881,0.0013,5.5239,4.6736,1.5694,5.2485,7.0165,3.3511,7.8059,2.5843,2.7514,1.6588,1.6617,2.498,4.0429,1.8302,0.762,4.889,0.9569,7.4576,4.4427,2.4672,1.5072,2.1441,5.1478,3.121,1.9356,1.1836,2.2044,2.1539,4.4323,2.6215,4.0289,1.3963,4.0671,2.0825,0.6075,3.3711,3.7289,7.4288,0.9103,0.8438,5.4247,0.8764,2.4167,2.5881,0.0444,1.0809,1.1466,0.7621,2.541,3.0604,4.6366,0.5207,0.0098,0.5535,4.3483,7.9138,2.3184,4.5826,2.8869,0.9057,5.3851,0.011,2.7458,6.1582,4.6401,5.9352,5.3658,4.8551,0.2571,2.7637,0.7214,3.9785,5.4616,1.7809,0.5796,2.6878,2.5549,5.2774,1.6379,5.2597,0.0775,6.404,0.1582,0.3555,5.379,8.7194,0.7977,5.3721,7.1348,1.8667,0.5796,0.6348,1.5842,2.946,1.1379,0.4643,4.6771,4.9945,5.4267,0.647,0.0354,5.2249,4.148,1.4343,3.2947,4.4386,1.4216,3.0503,0.7649,5.625,4.6257,1.0755,3.5948,0.7804,2.3068,3.2857,1.9028,10.3471,0.791,0.7651,0.604,2.3493,0.0247,8.4744,6.6676,3.3684,3.3666,0.0106,0.241,1.7745,2.8273,0.154,0.4162,3.1208,8.765,3.8633,3.0875,3.2194,1.0185,0.8628]}

Some were songs that she wrote herself , while others were new arrangements of other standards","text":"Throughout her career, Simone assembled a collection of songs that would later become standards in her repertoire. Some were songs that she wrote herself, while others were new arrangements of other standards or existing songs. The collection that Simone left behind is considered some of the most important song collections in jazz history.\nSimone was born in Milan, Italy to immigrant Italian parents, Angelo and Anna Dainelli. Like so many of the great songwriters of the early 1900\u2019s, Simone\u2019s music career was sidelined after World War II and she had to wait until the late 1940\u2019s before making a name for herself. By 1953, Simone had made a name for herself as a concert pianist, but it was only in 1957 that she released her self-titled first studio album. It was in this album that she first began to use the nickname that would become so synonymous with her musical persona. The album, and the first recorded version of \u201c Strangers in the Night, \u201d was the first that she was able to record professionally and with the help of a studio on the west coast. The studio worked, but it seemed they didn\u2019t understand the rhythmic style of jazz that Simone was attempting to capture. The album went on to sell a respectable amount of copies but due to its rhythmic style, it became increasingly popular in the early 1950\u2019s as the genre of swing and ballads dominated both the radio, and the charts. Simone and many of her contemporaries began to write original songs.\nHer career continued to thrive, and her work with the Benny Goodman Orchestra would result in her writing an original song, \u201c In You I Confide \u201d ( 1958 ). This was followed by another original composition, \u201c My Baby Just Cares for Me \u201d ( 1963 ). It was in 1965 that she recorded her first solo album, entitled \u201c Le Divas Volantes \u201d, which was released later that year. At the time of its release, only one single was recorded, a ballad entitled \u201c For My Eyes Only \u201d. Despite this small release, Simone was able to make a name for herself due to her ability to write original songs. Her songs were recorded by many jazz pianists over the next five years. Among those who recorded her songs, were Ella Fitzgerald, Woody Herman, Bill Evans, Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Getz. While they were all different instrumentalists, and each person had their own distinct taste in music, all chose her music for its outstanding quality and because they felt it had great potential as a jazz standard. From its first release until 1970, Simone scored over a hundred songs for instrumental or vocal recordings. She remained in the jazz scene, and wrote for other artists up until she died in 1999. Her repertoire consisted of over a thousand songs, the vast majority of which were written specifically for instrumentalists and singers. But she also wrote a few songs that suited pianists such as Bill Evans, and she recorded \u201c In You I Confide \u201d and \u201c My Baby Just Cares for Me \u201c.","token_len":629,"entropy":[5.8106,2.2138,0.3686,7.8999,12.059,1.0703,3.1573,0.0214,5.3191,1.3156,3.4754,4.2088,1.1709,10.2623,3.132,3.155,3.7587,0.7025,4.5976,2.2445,4.2161,1.2532,2.424,2.8516,2.3874,0.9259,2.47,0.0969,0.4469,5.9488,6.3682,2.7853,5.1374,9.8517,4.2612,7.4683,1.4677,1.0782,3.2107,5.137,5.6893,2.8207,5.5927,0.3078,2.1806,5.4574,5.556,0.0241,0.3106,0.68,2.1207,6.4274,1.5053,1.4473,4.1806,0.9948,0.3513,0.7449,13.9851,0.0045,2.6192,1.7363,0.4598,6.9001,0.6205,0.0846,3.9891,5.0675,5.0696,0.1548,2.031,8.7953,0.391,4.8097,6.9561,7.2209,4.7994,0.7646,5.9204,4.2667,0.0298,1.4788,2.2097,4.4375,6.4924,0.4574,0.5023,0.9401,3.1568,4.1958,17.4622,9.235,2.7155,0.1441,0.1819,14.3248,0.4235,0.5406,2.8584,6.407,1.3968,11.1635,5.2174,3.8352,0.0044,0.5235,3.0303,2.0249,3.6843,0.7321,4.7996,0.9898,1.9904,2.2403,1.6117,4.4383,0.1995,0.0285,2.8583,2.9765,1.8609,3.3583,0.034,0.0017,1.2339,4.8317,5.9169,0.3328,0.6228,1.0742,2.8527,2.2973,0.8119,0.0759,0.0026,1.4912,0.5256,6.5239,0.2326,0.0013,1.2072,2.5808,3.2809,0.4829,2.0288,1.2263,3.4788,0.4119,0.2395,4.1302,0.5928,6.2907,0.0206,0.034,0.0052,4.8229,3.3136,0.1096,1.4947,3.1166,0.6719,4.3657,1.0733,1.5718,0.3527,1.6486,3.056,2.6508,0.8256,4.5337,1.7334,7.524,6.4837,1.7809,0.7335,5.2302,3.1929,0.0294,0.5795,5.3306,4.3793,0.6247,2.9698,1.584,2.2436,5.7763,1.692,4.4504,3.9638,2.6128,0.3194,10.1821,4.0293,10.0717,3.6886,1.1827,1.3455,1.9398,0.9313,6.1178,6.2446,2.0147,3.0815,1.0829,5.0831,2.7477,4.3601,1.317,0.0064,3.723,3.4985,2.3804,4.0002,1.7202,0.9173,0.013,2.2131,4.7767,5.9643,1.4218,4.9397,0.2536,1.7216,2.2421,5.3441,5.5079,3.7241,1.429,2.2142,5.0247,6.4828,2.8201,4.683,1.7396,0.0772,3.4306,1.6843,7.1557,0.0008,5.3412,0.9635,6.9487,3.0749,0.596,1.3095,4.3358,0.6445,3.9493,0.3682,2.415,1.6715,4.7033,0.3318,0.0256,3.3384,3.7216,4.4268,2.5332,0.2688,0.9667,4.0605,6.0811,0.0227,2.6935,8.2305,0.0024,3.263,0.7535,0.871,3.2713,4.4346,4.3555,2.5737,0.6931,2.4653,2.3026,3.2834,0.0814,0.005,3.5001,2.1334,3.5676,3.1042,7.1227,1.6522,4.2459,0.3335,4.3374,5.1272,1.3451,4.3087,4.8138,1.3845,1.4671,3.5699,0.1678,2.5575,4.0592,5.5375,0.5355,0.1876,1.5574,3.6802,0.4422,3.9371,5.84,1.8582,3.5266,2.1916,6.2546,3.366,1.8369,1.0643,5.016,2.2514,1.8318,2.4746,3.5562,3.4514,1.4014,11.6661,0.2319,2.0965,4.4062,6.9277,0.0048,1.8183,5.16,4.1461,4.9222,2.1526,2.8063,4.9425,1.2855,4.959,6.7675,3.4335,9.7283,2.3181,4.1486,1.5426,4.0742,9.0563,1.1612,2.5198,2.2188,2.897,0.2149,3.7796,3.782,4.8368,0.6974,1.1597,0.4061,4.7773,5.004,6.8253,3.6323,1.0238,3.7171,0.8477,3.2092,0.5605,0.2445,2.8105,0.3606,3.6293,0.688,3.5092,5.5406,0.2292,1.5338,3.0451,0.9129,0.4206,1.5552,0.3501,0.5203,6.9637,3.0282,0.6968,7.5563,7.301,4.8027,8.7589,5.241,3.1855,0.5153,1.9369,1.2787,1.5996,1.5832,6.305,0.1352,0.0602,0.3499,5.0294,0.7196,0.3406,1.6693,2.1668,0.1182,0.1777,4.7399,2.6177,3.1613,1.0931,1.8115,1.5044,3.4091,4.0602,0.0113,2.6259,1.9084,0.2709,5.9885,2.9704,5.5893,1.9347,1.143,0.1212,2.0089,5.0641,2.0268,4.9337,1.688,0.1325,1.2186,1.902,1.7619,0.0045,2.7794,1.6049,1.3011,0.0207,0.0079,7.1852,0.0184,0.699,3.011,0.0187,2.6822,3.2244,1.5189,0.9862,2.9471,3.8301,1.5564,2.8593,2.6368,5.2018,5.4239,4.621,0.0255,4.6925,0.2888,2.4816,3.5218,0.4171,1.4689,5.2857,2.5779,1.2742,3.1974,1.2683,1.0922,1.958,3.0896,8.3663,0.0558,0.4306,0.3456,6.6868,8.5372,0.1768,4.2919,3.8708,0.2078,5.3195,0.7496,0.0023,2.09,7.504,6.6258,0.5387,0.3413,5.0049,4.3013,0.9624,1.8432,7.3941,6.5529,0.1255,0.2672,5.1986,3.776,5.7698,1.8545,1.0858,0.0324,3.705,5.6757,1.37,1.0668,0.095,4.0893,7.3827,5.7929,1.8003,2.0569,2.6232,9.5173,2.9954,1.2841,7.3404,2.6122,2.5557,1.469,3.3547,4.5592,1.1659,2.8914,0.4134,4.9266,3.777,0.2321,6.0356,4.4505,2.8851,0.969,4.9805,6.4192,0.1858,2.559,7.4017,2.2609,3.186,2.0542,2.0349,2.8501,8.3261,5.5885,4.4689,3.9634,0.9143,2.3556,5.5962,2.6755,0.9505,2.6544,2.6374,3.2608,1.8729,6.7277,2.7965,4.4272,2.1613,6.4083,0.427,2.8916,1.5111,0.3402,4.1421,0.3611,3.4385,8.1552,3.5867,0.3202,3.9516,2.7585,2.0049,0.7817,1.0151,5.1193,3.688,0.0029,0.201,0.158,0.5812,2.8379,5.953,0.1399,1.9756,6.5467,2.3728,3.3491,0.3239,6.7412,2.8423,1.7438,2.4803,2.9828,2.3995,1.5129,1.4753,7.7791,7.4341,0.1145,4.1997,0.0025,3.8847,0.5672,0.6258,4.1506,2.6886,3.7681,9.0041,0.0471,3.3544,0.2874,0.0932,0.0175,0.0096,0.9111,0.0296,2.5706,0.9994,0.0418,1.6295,0.0227,0.0551,0.0055,0.0005,0.0418,0.0017,1.7121,5.5199,1.2315]}

Under < unk >\nBenzodiazepines ( BDZs ) are a category of medicines that are known to have anxiolytic properties. Most are sedative-hypnotics that are considered very strong drugs and are also used to treat anxiety, panic, seizures, and other similar medical conditions. \nFactors Affecting Acute Benzodiazepine Addiction\nThe rate of addiction to benzodiazepines is affected in various ways by several factors such as genetics, addiction history, mental health disorders, and other factors.\nBenzodiazepine Addiction Genes\nGenetic factors influence people\u2019s vulnerability to addiction. The fact that many people who are genetically susceptible develop an addiction only after suffering a traumatic event, such as a car accident or sexual assault, suggests that there are other genetic factors that need to be identified.\nMost of the genes that influence addiction to benzodiazepines are known. A study performed in 2013, shows that only a single gene, 5-HT1A receptor, is significantly associated with increased likelihood of addiction to benzodiazepines among individuals with anxiety disorder and panic disorder.\nThe presence of a specific genetic variant, known as VNTR, in people with anxiety and panic disorder has also been linked with greater risk of addiction. Similarly, a gene variant known as COMT has been shown to influence the likelihood of addiction.\nAnother gene variant known as the gene encoding the dopamine beta-hydroxylase ( DBH ) has been shown to exert a protective effect against addiction to benzodiazepines by suppressing the bioavailability of the substance.\nAnxiety Disorders\nAnxiety disorders have a greater tendency to increase the likelihood of addiction to benzodiazepines than depression or bipolar disorder, since the latter two illnesses are known to affect the brain. People who suffer from anxiety or panic disorder also tend to experience more anxiety following a traumatic event, which leads to higher likelihood of addiction among them.\nMental Health Disorders\nOne of the risk factors that increase the likelihood of addiction to benzodiazepines is the presence of other mental health disorders, such as personality disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder. Some studies suggest that the co-occurrence of these disorders raises the risk of addiction to benzodiazepines by causing significant damage to the central nervous system.\nOther Mental Health Disorders\nThere is also evidence that addiction to benzodiazepines is more frequent among people who suffer from attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder ( ADD \/ ADHD ) and from other mental illnesses that exert a negative effect on the brain.\nPsychological Trauma and Sexual Assault\nThe fact that anxiety and panic disorder are common in people who were sexually abused, and that the

On March 10, 1963, President Johnson placed Kennedy's body in a private Roman Catholic funeral in state.\nAfter his death, Kennedy was succeeded in the office of President by Lyndon Johnson, a Southern Democrat. In his inauguration, Johnson was confronted by a large national military contingent, representing the US entry into the Vietnam War. He remained popular with soldiers who had participated in the War of the Indochina. His popularity with veterans of the Civil War was more mixed. Some veterans believed that during his term they had been placed on the back burner, and were only given postwar benefits during the Johnson administration. After Johnson's murder on January 22, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded him as the 46th President of the United States. At the time of Johnson's inauguration, he was the most popular American president in modern history, gaining more votes than any other president who had won the White House by a landslide.\nDuring his first term, Johnson had a difficult economic policy with a recession, budget deficits and increasing inflation. During the 1970s, his economic policies were further strained because of his controversial tax cuts for millionaires. In 1975, however, the economic problems of Johnson's administration were exacerbated by the Watergate scandal. The scandal involved allegations that Nixon's White House staff, including the President himself, had been conspiring with Watergate, a spying scandal that had occurred earlier in the 1970s at the U.S. government headquarters of the former Vice President, Richard Nixon, and the chairman of the US Congress, John E. Brinkley, Jr. The scandal broke out during Johnson's reelection campaign against Democrats Bill Clinton who won over forty percent more votes.\nPresident Johnson responded to Watergate by suspending his campaign activities in Washington. Following the announcement of his resignation in June of 1974, Vice President Gerald Ford became acting president while he awaited the outcome of the impeachment of Nixon, who was charged with the crimes of perjury, obstruction of justice, and taking credit for successful policy positions he had not created. During Ford's presidency, a new bipartisan Congress was elected, which established a bipartisan administration. Following the impeachment of the president Nixon, a new impeachment of the vice president Ford did not succeed, and the president of the United States was replaced by Richard M.\nIn August of, Richard Nixon resigned after having endured the Watergate impeachment scandal. Following his resignation, then Vice President Bill Clinton became acting president.

{"prompt":"In Egyptian belief , names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer . In keeping with this belief , the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins .","text":"In Egyptian belief, names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer. In keeping with this belief, the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins. The names of these deities and divinities are taken from the gods of the old Egyptian pantheon. Most of the names are the same today but some may have been changed. For example, Amon is sometimes called Ra.\nThe pantheon is a complex assortment of deities and goddesses with different functions and powers. Most of the deities were originally monotheistic. For example, Ra, Osiris and Isis were all part of the first pantheon, though later they became polytheistic as they were combined with other gods. The most prominent deities of the cults such as Isis -Osiris, Nephthys -Set and Horus-Hathor were all unified with other gods in the later period.\nIn the 18th\u201319th century, there was a revolution in Egyptian intellectual thought called Nondualism. The adherents to this revolutionary philosophy often thought that the Egyptian pantheon consisted of only one god. However, this is not the case as there were several gods referred to in the ancient texts as Amon-Horus, Amun-Ra and Ra-Horus. It seems likely that some of these were simply different names of the same god.\nOne of the important gods in the pantheon is Ra. This god was the leader of the sky and earth gods and was a solar deity. For example, he is associated with mummification and the sun god was a major divinity of the cult. The sun god is believed that he is the father of Osiris and of the gods Ra, Anubis and Tutankhamun.\nAs the name indicates, the most important god in this religion is Osiris. He was the supreme ruler of Egypt and he was also the son and heir of Ra. After his father died, Osiris was killed by his brother Set. Osiris is a god of agriculture and he was known as the king of all the world. He is the god of truth, justice and mercy.\nThe most important and most popular goddess in the ancient Egyptian pantheon was Isis. She was regarded as the queen of the gods of the sky and she is also considered to be the maternal mother of Ra. She is the goddess of agriculture and fertility and the mother of Horus. Isis is the daughter of Re, also called Osiris, and Aneth.\nAnother important god was known as Set. He was the brother and nemesis of Osiris. After his father Osiris was murdered, Set murdered him and is believed to have become the king of Egypt in his father's place. Set was part of the royal family and was thought to be a powerful king in his day.\nA special mention must be given to the goddess of wisdom and the goddess of evil. The names of these gods and goddesses are taken from the ancient Egyptian texts. The goddess of wisdom was known as Nekhbet and the god of evil as Seth. Their beliefs and powers are unknown to us, though both were revered in the ancient Egyptian culture.","token_len":632,"entropy":[11.1567,7.1313,0.3705,9.3879,9.3596,1.4821,7.6978,3.9562,0.0666,0.9931,6.3773,3.5362,2.0137,0.6313,2.6354,0.6717,2.8695,8.1011,0.014,0.6857,2.8957,0.1661,1.4955,2.5568,1.1117,3.5327,4.6324,6.1862,0.3079,2.6324,4.915,3.4717,4.9122,0.8768,2.0768,1.5523,0.3471,4.4152,0.6123,4.9131,8.731,0.0746,0.002,0.9694,6.0063,0.5264,0.7816,5.4591,0.8372,1.4016,4.8992,1.5103,2.0186,0.0683,1.5052,4.7752,1.1087,0.6119,1.3798,2.3928,4.8478,1.0632,5.8753,3.8718,1.5126,2.722,1.6134,1.5834,1.9348,1.7942,3.1942,0.3218,0.1847,7.9697,2.1629,4.6288,1.1315,5.3868,2.5012,1.6963,7.5195,6.8207,0.0394,2.3922,2.2979,3.0001,7.9267,0.0495,1.5616,1.9056,2.549,0.003,3.3365,2.6894,3.8839,1.158,3.8093,0.2893,3.3482,0.7352,0.5738,1.3167,4.4625,3.2037,7.0864,0.0446,0.3928,2.9034,4.5149,0.4045,0.0452,4.3654,2.9056,5.1482,1.7566,2.4564,1.0628,1.7466,5.6232,0.0531,0.4884,5.2813,2.4357,0.0402,1.7173,4.4335,3.2286,1.7496,1.701,5.2515,0.0299,0.1314,3.6895,1.9243,1.8686,7.1885,1.1053,1.6536,1.938,0.7724,1.6413,3.2083,2.5158,2.3176,1.7559,0.4577,6.6226,2.6714,6.3952,0.0017,2.2181,7.9504,11.1596,0.0011,0.8622,6.5658,0.0306,0.0033,2.7786,9.0705,2.2503,2.5848,5.3148,3.9658,8.9895,1.659,0.9839,1.4109,7.9383,2.3065,3.0687,0.8739,2.9739,1.2494,3.8949,3.7077,0.6925,1.3079,3.543,1.6443,6.7763,0.0174,7.9272,0.2491,0.0038,1.7213,0.6076,3.5725,0.7928,0.5804,5.7982,0.2067,2.1855,7.157,1.8111,5.6413,6.57,8.6283,4.744,0.5499,0.7808,2.0167,8.4489,3.8627,1.1869,6.1176,3.065,4.9731,4.497,0.5295,1.1245,3.7903,1.4044,0.0159,4.8549,0.1599,3.7122,1.5607,1.5915,2.3933,2.649,0.0573,2.3616,3.3249,1.0348,0.6534,0.0358,3.3133,2.0758,1.0657,2.9823,2.3327,8.2647,0.0551,1.0866,0.548,2.9434,2.6299,2.936,10.2583,5.1231,2.3677,2.5033,0.8573,5.9627,3.1229,0.7089,2.5486,0.8093,2.6433,0.6611,0.9567,1.0923,0.4345,4.196,3.6289,3.4041,0.0702,3.0356,0.5037,1.0163,3.2162,4.0444,5.1112,2.4635,3.0346,1.5935,0.1898,1.0315,0.6531,1.1245,4.2985,0.8101,0.082,4.5668,4.2188,2.0128,0.2957,1.2968,0.0036,1.6745,3.232,1.0324,2.7255,1.5196,1.5122,1.9939,4.8608,0.1153,0.3373,8.4615,1.9488,3.8135,3.5891,2.0081,1.0551,3.5619,8.1266,0.9446,1.0114,5.3476,1.1689,0.0347,2.6869,2.1366,3.7653,0.0115,8.3875,2.3436,0.4221,0.9178,2.0564,4.219,3.4421,5.6151,3.0817,5.6211,5.9522,1.1095,2.8964,0.5602,5.0499,1.302,2.0212,2.897,0.4464,1.4718,4.4734,7.1747,1.9044,1.2252,0.5776,3.1789,0.1333,4.8715,0.983,4.8585,1.4018,3.6894,4.2924,1.6389,6.1845,0.1193,0.3544,7.7993,0.406,0.0001,0.0201,0.3356,1.3632,4.645,1.8066,2.3891,4.0671,0.1084,1.1097,4.9152,0.8154,1.6758,0.9956,4.228,5.9626,1.4777,3.8108,0.472,1.8323,1.3528,0.8663,4.8985,1.8376,0.291,2.1745,1.2544,3.7761,0.8069,2.6197,0.6967,4.1433,4.0016,2.1047,0.6652,3.378,0.4175,5.6816,1.6944,3.4609,1.3781,0.5306,2.3611,1.5388,4.2303,0.8935,1.9632,2.5934,5.4431,1.2656,3.2952,2.5154,3.4236,2.4103,0.6252,5.5861,0.6128,2.9349,1.1397,3.8717,0.6219,0.6464,3.2453,0.0976,3.373,0.9637,5.1344,0.5685,1.5272,1.42,2.0132,2.0493,0.1815,8.5889,1.4067,1.2067,0.4245,4.3699,0.317,1.3426,1.5645,2.8876,0.6984,3.9797,1.8,3.8556,3.6646,1.0506,0.3859,3.2149,1.5032,0.1692,0.0025,1.0709,2.5502,0.2413,1.0022,0.5924,4.9516,0.1149,0.6673,4.5177,0.2175,0.8902,2.3549,1.9531,0.8842,2.9279,0.3516,6.1944,2.2574,2.5696,2.8341,1.504,0.1611,0.2959,6.7372,2.7056,0.1553,2.911,0.4242,1.4925,0.9138,1.9614,1.9674,0.1261,4.6209,0.516,4.0288,1.3655,2.4867,1.2699,0.0636,3.4959,0.6684,4.0452,0.8253,1.5362,3.5924,0.0883,6.3623,1.6007,5.424,2.3153,3.2461,1.4459,0.9539,6.4015,7.5649,2.7617,1.3538,4.4522,1.287,1.3932,1.5552,5.8319,0.0849,4.5893,0.4099,0.8303,0.4577,0.6733,5.1024,1.5197,10.5416,0.0275,0.082,2.3212,0.9161,5.0141,0.6662,0.4809,6.2982,1.1204,2.9527,1.3071,0.4405,6.7908,2.3101,0.9077,7.0003,1.2309,0.0814,0.3385,3.439,0.7236,3.7693,0.1033,1.8813,4.7095,2.7518,4.6075,0.0255,3.0439,0.1244,1.087,1.1791,7.4683,0.0473,0.3528,4.0905,0.4612,0.8652,1.8011,3.9042,0.0944,0.6743,2.5197,4.8039,4.314,3.7935,1.3558,1.7007,0.1831,1.5949,3.5121,5.5307,5.2288,3.3964,0.1859,2.4505,0.1154,1.0277,2.1992,1.0546,4.6209,1.6496,2.4728,1.2633,0.062,8.1484,0.358,2.0957,5.0655,0.2332,1.4327,1.7891,1.6399,0.1661,0.0079,0.8299,0.5248,0.0195,0.3091,2.6559,0.9178,3.757,0.7746,1.7063,2.4854,0.6632,0.5149,1.7884,3.5819,0.2463,6.8034,3.9862,7.4321,2.7336,2.0234,3.6871,0.1057,3.83,6.0761,8.7956,1.2948,7.418,7.1703,2.371,3.2938,1.2494,5.1095,2.5942,1.0863,2.5344,2.7307,5.8118,2.375,6.3367,1.8637,0.9786,1.3643,1.3745,3.8039,0.3414]}

It uses this call to","text":"The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah @ - @ ah @ - @ < unk > with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to attract mates, to defend nests, and to scare off aggressive birds. The call is most often heard out on the cliffs in warm weather where the birds forage for berries and insects. ( I know my Aussie sounds much louder than your snot nosed browns. ) I saw a pair I was following on a wall when a passerby told me that they are more noisy during the laying season. I can't tell you when it is because I have never seen them laying so it must vary from year to year but it is most often in the spring.\nIn the morning a bunch of guys went to a site at Lake Halsey to get ready to do some work. The owner was busy looking around and kept saying, \"I see something. \" Some of the guys saw what he saw. I saw one and a half birdies all perched on the ledge, the rightmost one was about 25 feet long and the first 20 feet were a beautiful brownish shade of blue. The rest were plumage but the eye on top was orange. They were big, almost like a raven or a swan. Another girl over there saw seven. Some of the guys got their scopes out and I thought about what they saw, how long they were there and where they headed. They are really good at scaring off a predator because there is very little of the body to break up against so they can hold for long enough to see if it is a predator or not. That was my idea. The guys will tell you that only a bird gets scared off if it is really scared. I know that is true, most predators can move pretty quick so that would mean fast eyesight not to be fooled. They are not as fast as the hawks that look at everything to make sure no one is around. The ones he did see flew up to about 400 feet off the cliff. I told the girl she should report it to someone like the BLM so they can look at it. It's a big part of what we do now, to make sure all people watching wildlife report it.\nI got up to feed my chickens in the morning and was so happy to see one of the guys come up with a telescope. He told us two birds. No one else thought of it and we thought he was exaggerating. They ran up to about 200 feet on the mountain side and stayed about 30 seconds before heading up the cliff.\nI started talking to one of the guys about what he saw and he mentioned that maybe the eagles came up from somewhere else and looked for them. He says that they usually come up there when the weather is cold because that is the place to find their food and the birds come up here for a reason. I hope that they have been there this year. We have had very little water damage over the last few days but that could change. I don't want to have to spend another summer cleaning up.","token_len":632,"entropy":[11.4135,8.588,2.2462,1.1221,6.4961,15.2826,1.7777,2.4773,8.2764,1.9225,6.82,14.7438,11.95,9.0762,3.2329,9.0299,2.4988,1.9015,0.4489,5.7958,8.8132,4.9113,5.959,6.6887,2.4074,4.9101,6.0305,7.8616,4.2962,1.8805,3.9403,7.3373,3.9946,4.1072,0.9851,6.4912,5.2457,2.2365,3.8275,5.766,6.9257,1.057,0.8881,0.557,6.8197,1.2187,5.984,1.5201,0.4874,2.3289,2.8768,1.1903,5.8727,1.3699,2.2737,6.9377,3.6254,0.7205,6.8061,3.2612,6.958,0.7036,4.7689,1.3085,2.1638,8.4075,0.1173,1.1996,4.55,1.303,4.3876,0.4613,4.7942,7.754,4.1258,5.0732,6.7109,0.1136,8.0077,5.2011,3.8975,1.025,4.0568,6.5414,2.264,7.3988,0.6173,7.5305,2.8035,2.5852,1.08,3.3448,5.6486,1.7814,4.9785,6.9104,3.181,4.9385,2.131,1.4981,7.259,3.4115,2.857,5.5227,0.6857,4.478,0.1316,2.2642,2.3018,4.6469,6.1759,6.7832,5.5821,0.6601,10.1748,0.1626,0.917,1.7644,4.5314,1.4522,2.6021,1.1196,3.78,2.6672,1.6783,2.638,1.2467,2.2333,1.2414,0.8513,1.8387,7.0499,3.7285,6.9897,4.8843,7.9191,1.6854,2.4776,0.0175,0.0028,3.8347,1.8344,1.3416,5.3855,1.4806,2.1769,0.7849,2.8264,1.2694,3.0605,6.2701,1.426,4.4206,3.9752,7.2282,0.0548,5.4135,6.3038,2.1419,2.5072,6.88,4.1714,5.5872,4.751,5.416,0.0526,1.9165,3.1363,4.5103,1.7512,4.2455,1.1068,3.029,0.968,2.1311,5.2201,1.9698,4.7983,4.1339,2.6253,1.4935,7.0034,2.3511,2.4915,0.3266,2.8194,4.211,4.2752,3.2875,5.7625,5.9284,1.0555,0.438,1.1773,5.2466,3.3273,2.0359,2.096,2.1262,2.1572,3.5506,3.7252,4.215,3.6,0.1871,7.1697,2.9155,5.4229,6.7775,0.5957,1.3076,3.2191,2.6488,3.0203,7.3084,4.2562,1.6735,2.0414,2.7801,4.5447,1.1718,3.6624,0.8812,1.6555,6.0476,6.5452,0.7616,0.8966,3.8086,7.2394,4.3748,3.7326,5.5446,0.646,2.6304,0.5586,1.4064,3.2964,0.9354,6.4971,0.1166,6.0374,1.8753,6.4754,5.3666,5.0998,0.9495,4.9798,0.6984,3.0825,1.0993,5.3481,1.831,4.7315,2.9988,1.6024,5.5839,4.1038,1.5968,7.0452,0.0919,0.5496,6.1674,6.5998,7.1663,1.2295,2.4966,7.9324,3.3795,5.1437,1.1342,0.6668,1.8848,3.5742,4.0317,6.9657,3.8799,1.9811,0.5119,4.1551,3.1786,4.655,2.5199,1.3551,2.2253,2.3709,4.0345,3.2083,1.0381,1.097,2.412,1.093,3.1403,0.4758,7.4113,0.3427,2.5132,3.8086,4.224,3.6599,1.3338,5.8512,1.4854,1.3061,3.7949,2.9012,5.6405,4.1214,0.7491,4.7071,0.0495,4.4259,2.1452,4.0665,2.3837,6.4111,2.3123,7.7735,4.3325,1.3802,1.5656,5.3004,5.7886,2.4205,2.4091,0.4585,3.7344,3.226,1.8815,1.0546,1.8629,2.2438,0.9771,0.5502,0.1454,5.0736,2.2407,2.4487,4.7707,1.0559,2.2015,3.9157,6.5192,4.6924,0.1434,1.4305,6.8208,2.0511,3.9976,5.0119,3.7502,1.8794,2.8746,0.7293,0.766,4.8362,2.7511,1.9401,2.2941,3.9524,1.8997,2.6922,1.7205,1.8701,5.6859,4.0372,3.5645,5.7916,4.692,3.9534,3.2524,3.1476,3.8078,3.5238,8.1835,5.5855,1.7785,7.6949,2.8261,1.8548,4.4893,1.1533,2.9092,1.7187,2.9308,2.505,2.1148,0.6334,1.9247,6.9101,0.0076,3.5069,5.0765,2.0281,6.3369,5.1733,2.4721,0.9664,4.156,0.9144,0.9521,4.0711,0.7304,2.1796,5.1435,7.6803,4.1263,1.3284,6.0227,2.3819,1.5469,3.0434,5.4084,0.3529,4.4379,0.4028,2.1875,1.7682,2.0083,4.9254,2.3337,3.2934,3.456,2.3443,7.1168,1.4478,0.7176,5.5914,5.6778,2.7274,9.1555,3.3065,1.3736,1.2546,3.7575,1.3508,0.2515,0.8772,3.2377,3.2152,1.9191,3.4835,5.7316,0.0158,2.4419,3.5871,0.653,5.3858,2.2915,3.464,3.3399,0.0805,3.8189,4.0565,6.1217,4.5219,6.1731,1.5839,1.1072,2.0652,2.2572,3.8105,3.5868,1.8242,7.1988,1.9278,4.2074,3.297,0.4767,0.8699,0.9681,3.6844,4.8769,2.7121,1.0354,0.3771,4.1449,0.4355,0.7624,2.5293,4.2538,1.5564,2.8184,1.033,10.2903,0.9887,1.4135,3.5571,3.6888,6.8531,1.3718,6.1485,6.5101,0.6686,2.4831,5.5886,1.9324,1.0302,2.6141,2.415,3.598,2.3723,0.5781,7.0101,0.0024,0.7455,3.7674,6.1045,1.7358,0.8908,5.8232,2.7632,0.1826,4.5217,0.9722,7.1718,3.1069,0.8995,6.4872,3.849,3.1812,4.5724,3.7894,4.3866,2.302,1.48,1.2831,0.6422,3.1965,1.8812,4.5573,4.1131,0.2883,2.9887,0.2099,0.1798,0.6586,2.6278,2.2965,1.1733,0.7865,1.4437,1.0191,5.2869,1.328,5.7237,2.6624,7.9175,0.175,4.2944,0.9488,2.9809,3.9345,2.9343,1.2463,4.2099,2.7734,1.6371,0.5059,1.9424,5.2228,1.5753,1.7972,4.3362,2.5804,0.6212,4.7887,3.1551,1.7542,2.6035,0.533,2.8804,4.7803,3.7475,1.2069,2.6044,2.7671,1.3704,2.5316,4.464,1.598,2.0853,3.3489,1.1255,3.8965,1.082,2.7923,2.7125,2.302,5.734,0.2935,2.0197,6.422,1.589,2.8303,3.6751,3.4897,3.4572,4.6309,2.8486,1.2773,3.5086,2.5072,3.1888,4.9268,1.9787,7.141,6.7265,4.4593,0.2338,0.91,1.1131,1.3746,2.6425,3.3789,3.4712,1.7796,1.0545,1.9474,3.2295,0.0009,2.5116,0.3614,4.1677,0.6015,3.7383,4.2874,5.4744,5.683,0.6487,3.6383]}
{"prompt":"The term ' heavy metal ' , as it was used by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem , referred to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin 's Led Zeppelin","text":"The term'heavy metal ', as it was used by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, referred to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin III and Kiss's The Ultimate Warrior. And there is, in a sense, nothing wrong with that. It was an aural world that the bands inhabited, which sounded all the more convincing because it was so unexpected. So in an increasingly predictable digital world, where the only constant is change, the words'heavy metal'and'heavy'are being used too casually.\nIt's a concept that some people feel too dated to be relevant. The word'heavy metal'is more popular than a simple adjective such as'thrash metal '. But it was never intended to be.\nFor some critics, Metallica's newest album, Some Kind of Monster, was an example of the genre's death from the inside out. Others called it a return to the genre that once defined them.\nBut what it all boils down to is what this band are - heavy, powerful musicians playing in a genre that no one had considered a'band'since the early eighties. Their sound - the guitars, the vocals, the rhythm guitars, the bass, the drums - all work together in a very compact way, and it's easy to forget that this is the product of two people, Kirk Hammett and Lars Ulrich, and their drummer Zak de la Rocha. For them, this is the sound you would hear in a room full of drunk people shouting obscenities. It was one of the most shocking soundtracks of all time.\nThe band are heavy and you just know it in their performance. It's very much a collective experience, with one songwriter, one guitarist, one drummer. At the end of the set, each of us could barely contain our relief.\nThe band were not a commercial success even though they were playing in Europe in 1982, when rock music as we knew it was going to be put out of business and the rest of the world would take over. Metallica made a couple of Top Twenty albums in the US, but that was about it. But while you listen to Some Kind of Monster, there's no doubt that the album is as good as it is because of them.\nThey've gone out of their way to produce this CD in the same manner as the classic albums - they've taken the sound from their debut album with the same intent and the same techniques, mixing it using the same equipment.\nIt's no wonder that even though Metallica's sound has a huge influence on younger bands, such as Thin Lizzy, Van Halen, Lamb of God and Black Sabbath, some people were disappointed when that group released their'heavy metal'album,'Power Metal ', which featured several very heavy songs. Those songs are as heavy as Metallica's and there's no doubt they would have been an extreme sound had Metallica decided one night to release them on tape and then put the album out.\nMetallica may have died, but the power behind them might continue.","token_len":633,"entropy":[7.9794,7.4743,12.9124,6.6035,10.7831,4.3537,1.7757,2.3392,2.7456,1.4931,10.3391,4.4697,1.0206,2.1646,5.1915,7.4341,3.9809,10.3158,3.673,2.588,6.623,0.0909,2.3123,4.9074,9.9014,5.4773,0.0075,0.2589,8.537,1.2306,0.0039,6.4192,0.0044,0.0018,1.2507,5.1726,0.0033,0.0197,2.5172,1.3239,8.1061,2.9746,3.6624,8.7013,6.8431,0.9143,5.7283,4.0387,1.8586,4.3481,2.7172,4.3792,1.7281,0.0351,3.2012,1.181,0.0386,2.0257,1.1053,2.5534,2.8811,3.3987,7.6974,0.3714,6.1486,2.233,3.8579,4.3439,6.3818,1.1088,3.7675,6.6487,5.8271,1.2492,0.7335,5.7258,3.7652,1.8117,0.7859,2.5925,8.4691,0.7957,4.7566,4.0325,4.0056,5.3966,8.1904,8.3669,1.0122,0.3631,4.4244,2.0574,5.0831,5.7598,0.7652,4.9495,0.3713,2.124,6.3646,6.2627,0.9011,0.1988,0.7811,7.3369,1.4566,3.2824,6.3388,3.5753,4.362,1.6896,6.0326,4.0816,1.1775,1.0832,6.3038,0.8486,2.2871,5.862,0.5988,5.4839,2.2255,3.9869,5.2952,8.1422,1.4311,3.3103,2.3583,1.7229,3.01,2.6947,2.9517,0.2751,0.8629,0.1796,1.7779,4.758,4.4346,0.8741,4.9645,5.6145,4.5033,3.5788,0.0028,10.6063,10.9948,6.7094,4.9631,7.9333,2.677,1.6402,3.6448,3.6316,2.9484,0.5037,0.4014,3.0063,3.4321,4.6343,3.4036,5.8924,0.468,8.4777,0.0448,1.1351,8.0044,0.4155,1.5065,9.1988,1.7603,0.2993,4.8103,0.8274,2.0275,2.9143,4.0457,0.0953,1.7778,2.4258,0.5886,6.8265,6.0276,2.1451,3.0018,0.7064,0.3216,5.5645,5.054,0.4445,1.4429,6.3407,0.0722,0.9698,3.6318,3.8156,4.4779,3.3441,4.4718,1.0128,1.9994,2.8674,3.5148,4.6845,4.3693,1.5871,0.0007,0.003,0.2914,4.3207,4.3859,2.7628,4.9392,5.1841,5.4577,3.1681,5.2238,5.7629,4.6982,3.3569,1.3604,2.7183,0.7578,4.2867,0.9276,4.1873,5.0963,3.3973,10.355,7.142,5.529,14.1954,4.2426,6.2197,6.2137,0.0008,0.7906,3.9661,2.9246,4.5257,3.2158,6.0796,0.7459,1.2022,1.8327,0.4979,0.2357,4.9278,4.8392,1.2323,0.3805,2.7131,2.4125,0.4213,0.9455,0.5829,3.4238,4.6569,1.3237,2.242,1.0089,3.7681,7.3739,1.7041,1.5085,1.9927,2.6205,0.7994,3.3482,0.0821,2.8194,0.8936,3.3037,1.4056,2.0355,6.785,0.0469,3.4051,3.9095,2.3632,8.6981,1.8216,0.1541,0.309,4.9712,0.4125,0.0005,1.2179,2.4953,3.6734,4.6642,9.7665,8.4609,2.6765,0.8732,0.467,0.0168,0.821,5.6275,2.4782,0.2125,3.0603,1.124,1.6081,3.4667,5.7059,3.6837,2.297,1.4616,0.9449,5.7041,1.1163,0.0019,7.4339,2.7007,5.8322,5.3161,0.0001,0.0013,2.2657,2.8199,2.7494,4.566,0.3527,0.5534,2.1918,6.3211,5.4457,0.5445,1.6647,1.3288,0.0189,0.8075,0.6047,2.4316,1.6517,2.603,5.497,2.6891,7.2894,4.537,2.8053,1.7088,5.5224,1.3049,7.1881,0.6352,2.3893,0.4758,4.5856,2.952,1.4133,4.8833,2.5508,1.5024,2.9608,4.1119,3.6526,7.8049,2.4478,1.8677,2.1837,0.5823,0.8294,1.4079,1.7658,5.5717,1.0975,1.2837,0.2207,0.7224,6.4629,0.3917,4.8303,1.2635,3.0544,5.0315,4.3381,2.6214,0.4268,7.4675,1.8359,1.7837,2.5278,1.8543,2.947,4.2437,3.6241,7.3566,1.5692,7.5708,1.5279,0.5693,1.4114,3.8813,1.9219,4.1914,4.5333,5.1887,1.4207,1.9319,5.0384,2.6478,5.8021,1.3784,3.4869,0.0034,0.47,4.471,0.5206,1.3786,7.1642,2.0216,1.9824,0.5078,3.5313,2.499,4.3315,0.1555,0.5662,0.207,0.8638,3.8982,3.6207,0.4115,4.2391,0.0014,4.524,1.5757,4.7839,0.1266,7.4351,6.4457,2.042,2.0197,0.9857,2.4694,1.14,1.0439,3.4708,1.0033,4.0592,0.3549,0.3919,3.5555,5.569,4.9837,4.0922,0.1327,6.0067,0.0039,0.0195,0.0168,0.8203,3.2787,1.0873,1.8582,2.3362,0.6055,2.0371,3.4833,1.6874,3.7874,2.8511,0.3056,1.0393,2.3513,5.6974,1.152,5.2374,0.376,1.0667,3.3205,2.6743,4.5708,3.7267,0.7455,0.4215,0.0037,0.059,5.5052,3.9563,8.275,3.0023,2.2004,2.2066,3.648,1.3807,2.3814,5.2141,2.557,3.2884,3.202,1.3352,3.6708,1.69,4.7167,3.0501,2.9614,4.5658,0.8683,4.5325,2.4167,1.7816,5.7639,2.0422,3.5066,0.1165,6.4505,2.2814,5.4163,0.6879,7.5477,2.0767,0.4225,3.0178,1.9349,1.7712,2.8904,0.3815,4.7368,1.9782,0.8404,5.1401,1.981,2.6564,0.001,2.1201,3.1252,1.446,4.6793,5.0734,1.6108,0.2343,7.2411,1.9748,0.7602,4.6459,0.0293,6.8761,0.0236,0.0001,1.0681,8.5504,0.6163,0.0005,0.8944,9.0847,0.2958,0.0009,0.795,5.166,0.2064,0.2611,4.3652,1.6207,5.4375,4.3692,2.016,4.7668,4.7812,3.7084,1.1492,9.5944,6.8661,1.3618,0.5259,2.1681,7.4526,9.8682,5.414,6.9535,2.2288,3.4666,5.3538,5.3087,2.8701,2.3293,0.7911,5.4042,0.7636,2.3567,4.4763,3.6358,0.2181,4.4511,0.0038,0.586,3.63,4.5149,0.8803,0.8408,1.2094,2.2125,3.4408,0.6002,1.1466,4.7727,5.8464,8.071,4.5386,2.6698,0.0008,6.4133,9.0543,4.0006,0.5569,1.5282,4.7312,2.7874,5.6345,2.8887,3.1441,3.1542,2.5496,2.0206,0.49,1.9963,0.6159,6.1554,0.0073,0.0031,5.46,0.7572,7.04,2.23,0.1397,2.504,5.6205,4.9362,2.7392,6.5836,4.1778,2.0404]}

At Wilberforce ,","text":"In the summer of 1894, Du Bois received several job offers, including one from the prestigious Tuskegee Institute ; he accepted a teaching job at Wilberforce University in Ohio. At Wilberforce, he worked as a part-time assistant professor, developing an experimental psychology curriculum for the students. In 1895, Du Bois accepted another teaching job at the university in Stellenbosch. Du Bois' research interests were very varied in nature, however, ranging from the study of primitive and racial characteristics to issues relating to the Negro intellectual and political development.\nIn 1896, Du Bois left Stellenbosch for the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education to pursue graduate study. At that time, a total of eighteen white men and two white women were enrolled in the Graduate School - a total of twenty students. The number of African Americans enrolled at that time was the small. It was due to the number of men who had left the school in 1896, the students were able to finish Du Bois'courses to graduate in 1897.\nIn that year, Du Bois successfully defended a dissertation called \" The Physical Education of Negroes in Stores ; Exam of Physical Conditions, and Immediate Relation of such to Race and Class. \" During the same year, he married Mary Lee Burrill, a teacher, in Brooklyn, New York. Shortly after marrying, the Du Bois travelled to Washington, D. C. to study at the Smithsonian National Museum. There, his research interests were further broadened. In New York, Du Bois worked at his own schools and conducted experiments. In 1897, he was appointed to head of the National Institute of Education as the president of the Smithsonian. He was also one of the co-editors of the journal Human Science. He was appointed as a member of the Department of Labor, later in his presidency as an Assistant Secretary of Labor.\nHe has left a considerable number of books and articles to the people of his own country. Du Bois worked at New York University to teach classes in Negro history during the first three years of his presidency in 1900. To celebrate Africa Day, he proposed the creation of the African-American College, an institution for all the black students of the United States. A special committee was established to work in cooperation for a year in order to form the African-American College.\nDu Bois continued to research and write. He wrote on many subjects, including black education, black culture, black political development, etc. Among Du Bois'publications which were widely appreciated, was \" The Struggle for Civilization. \" Du Bois was the author of several books, such as \" The Story of My Life, \" \"Famous Negroes, \" and \" The Signification of Race. \"\nThe legacy of Theodore Roosevelt and the enduring influence of the Roosevelt philosophy are profound in American government as well as our culture. The great spirit and values which the Roosevelt presidency brought to public life are a constant source of inspiration for a generation of Americans who were and still are called on to play their part in the great public affairs of the Nation.","token_len":634,"entropy":[2.6222,4.8717,0.4522,5.212,3.8123,0.2703,7.8648,2.7428,0.0101,4.6774,5.4711,8.542,0.0647,2.5844,1.2495,1.5362,1.7422,1.9501,6.7888,8.2079,0.19,0.0,0.5894,9.6926,1.8444,4.2182,2.3464,4.8896,2.3983,0.6952,7.8836,4.3315,0.0162,1.72,1.2393,4.3787,1.2577,4.0581,2.7883,0.0041,0.0004,0.2604,1.0584,2.7065,1.275,0.4636,6.0312,0.0832,0.0234,3.4721,1.0579,2.2106,6.69,2.7985,5.0652,4.3212,1.8802,2.4793,1.7432,3.77,0.541,2.2425,2.8838,0.1923,1.5368,0.0129,0.001,4.7342,3.3464,0.5388,0.3535,0.7248,0.7257,3.9323,3.4518,4.459,9.403,0.0031,0.0,1.8442,2.7281,0.0088,0.0015,3.5457,3.9401,3.728,1.6192,5.5847,3.1003,4.1557,2.2756,0.8875,4.6378,1.0467,5.5961,0.0857,1.7865,2.8898,0.0132,5.9641,4.0645,7.7379,5.0883,1.051,6.9994,3.201,0.0503,1.4215,6.763,6.5145,2.4983,2.1868,2.9694,0.4713,2.4032,5.0721,1.7998,0.1664,0.5626,0.0077,0.0023,4.4072,3.5721,0.0394,0.0113,0.0008,1.3848,1.9927,0.9164,0.0376,2.5666,10.3778,0.152,0.5025,2.3802,3.9249,2.1768,3.729,3.1486,3.2967,3.2155,1.6826,0.11,0.1346,4.4812,6.2337,0.0281,6.1608,5.6104,2.9808,2.8549,2.4324,3.5059,0.0193,1.0297,2.1696,0.4283,0.7538,4.3481,0.1659,8.2941,2.3993,3.9531,0.2473,3.018,3.7703,0.7634,2.1618,3.8972,0.0996,3.9271,1.7734,1.5117,1.7698,2.7293,0.2588,0.5029,5.4265,7.6828,8.2442,4.3467,0.5841,6.2104,0.4063,0.8866,4.2204,0.033,4.1093,2.1956,1.6093,3.304,0.9024,1.9471,2.3098,1.8192,1.3996,2.7285,5.5938,1.8398,3.7266,0.0163,6.3593,8.416,0.0037,0.0011,0.3103,14.7998,2.1921,5.6819,4.2778,2.6412,1.789,0.4926,1.2181,1.8362,6.6494,0.3203,0.1439,1.1475,0.0027,0.0023,7.0522,4.7301,2.8743,6.4682,6.1079,0.7027,4.488,7.2203,5.5542,0.1558,0.7574,0.262,2.1125,13.4263,7.0858,9.1305,5.9547,3.8905,5.9294,3.5178,3.2549,6.7688,2.0572,5.3766,0.0979,2.2431,7.7618,1.9219,3.1566,1.472,2.4731,3.8175,0.4482,4.8158,1.0471,3.6075,0.4896,0.1202,2.2023,6.6939,3.6596,5.7124,6.1181,4.3902,1.1738,1.456,5.7391,2.7959,3.5445,5.7874,0.7455,0.3302,0.0037,0.3605,5.2145,0.6377,2.3087,0.2965,2.565,5.1217,0.0174,0.0081,10.9381,0.3613,3.6613,0.5293,0.0801,0.0006,4.2513,1.5735,0.9925,2.953,1.988,0.5639,3.8913,3.7947,0.3125,1.3606,3.6201,0.3622,4.1779,2.4644,2.7107,0.9925,3.8373,5.4632,0.0564,1.1453,1.8011,5.9693,0.1277,0.3735,2.0278,0.007,0.002,3.1597,3.2019,6.1544,3.1033,7.2024,1.9844,5.9583,2.8928,2.8363,1.6342,2.5726,0.147,0.4535,2.1624,1.7399,2.335,5.5227,3.397,0.3464,2.4227,2.2737,0.5251,3.6416,5.222,2.0903,4.4649,0.1564,0.2084,4.863,2.9807,1.9584,1.4363,1.6165,4.618,0.0143,0.3233,4.545,0.1709,7.4152,0.0331,0.1682,0.4865,4.6669,6.6297,6.48,1.1462,2.4441,1.3508,3.2365,3.154,1.6563,1.9878,0.0283,0.1199,5.3492,0.0177,4.2078,2.0988,5.6582,3.7771,3.4721,5.2912,2.3874,3.2731,3.0477,0.6389,0.38,0.4633,0.7133,1.2563,3.7407,4.6906,6.8825,2.4204,4.3677,2.2763,0.0054,3.1255,1.7439,1.5783,2.0231,2.4554,5.8457,0.6973,3.1834,3.9622,0.8394,0.9768,3.3863,0.0074,0.0019,5.7052,2.8721,6.1631,0.1991,1.0525,4.2771,3.3356,4.3842,1.3832,4.2183,3.498,5.4709,0.5781,2.882,3.5721,0.5866,0.0995,0.3605,2.7427,4.0123,3.3206,0.4662,6.0396,6.1774,11.3086,4.7712,0.7179,1.1085,7.0752,2.4236,2.5279,0.0184,2.0298,2.3852,3.1909,0.0316,4.8808,3.1082,3.4998,1.5976,2.3448,4.5354,3.3364,3.9473,1.5388,0.9662,0.9254,1.7484,0.0041,0.7269,4.2635,4.5283,3.182,1.3353,2.0642,0.6244,3.7664,3.2021,3.3576,8.629,3.6305,4.3074,3.7359,2.5283,0.0373,5.6421,2.3172,1.9585,0.5025,0.0306,0.2262,0.6866,1.7672,1.6663,0.0067,0.0023,4.5422,0.767,3.64,1.4235,1.5419,3.1236,1.3214,2.7178,4.2038,3.6272,0.9654,1.091,0.9314,4.7871,4.9258,0.5875,3.6498,2.1429,0.2364,2.382,3.5899,3.6395,0.2112,6.4579,0.4478,4.9255,5.8901,0.0108,0.0016,0.119,11.1122,2.0555,4.8655,1.8211,5.4685,6.0881,2.4833,2.1001,1.5548,1.7013,6.3846,0.8445,6.4149,3.446,0.3067,2.4525,0.0043,0.0042,2.4405,2.6381,2.4875,0.0706,2.2013,0.8751,1.1501,4.4476,0.0014,0.7345,1.3321,5.4585,0.0357,6.5833,1.9585,2.3363,0.8888,0.9378,8.2538,3.0777,0.491,0.9694,1.6374,0.821,0.7828,0.3277,1.445,8.6196,5.5171,0.0458,2.4324,1.5219,1.3137,1.6909,3.0971,7.3818,0.1385,8.8436,0.9548,2.3034,1.3991,7.5574,2.1875,0.1856,2.4573,4.7125,8.7153,3.6015,5.3717,2.7185,5.2086,6.3746,4.7204,0.4397,0.156,5.2401,3.7898,0.2397,2.1792,4.5035,6.8188,2.9182,5.0286,3.1801,3.0708,0.9922,2.8774,2.1516,0.4207,4.7482,0.1418,1.4356,3.9127,4.2504,1.4621,0.0176,1.0954,1.5473,4.5651,1.351,0.472,1.3981,2.5859,3.5005,7.2235,1.8367,0.0252,5.7533,2.7261,0.2816,6.1092,2.1118,0.1536,0.17,1.1002,3.1935,4.4799,2.7869,0.2044,1.2549,4.6287,0.1909]}

During his time with the club, Lawton made a combined total of 17 appearances.\nLawton was the last player to join Blackpool on a weekly wage at the new \u00a3 300 pay day as the Pirates went into administration in late 1952. Lawton spent time on trial for Southend United, but Blackpool eventually went to Oxford City, and Lawton returned to Second Division side Brentford, scoring a hat-trick against Middlesbrough on his first appearance. Brentford won promotion that season, and the following season he appeared regularly, making a total of 46 league appearances and scoring once.\nIn the 1956\u201357 season, Lawton made just one first-team appearance for Brentford, but he continued to receive regular chances with the reserve team. That season he made 21 appearances as Brentford went into administration, and then was signed by fellow Championship side Oldham Athletic for \u00a3 10 @. Lawton appeared once before his contract was terminated after four weeks, and in the following season he joined newly-assembled third division side Halifax Town on a one-way free transfer.\nLawton joined Third Division side Bury in 1960, joining his former assistant-manager John Toshack at the club. Toshack said upon hearing about Lawton's arrival that he would try to play him as a right-wing full-back. Lawton soon established himself as a consistent starter and Bury won promotion back to the Second Division in the 1961\u201362 season. Lawton made a combined total of 45 league appearances over the three seasons at the club.\nLawton signed for Fourth Division club Mansfield Town after making a total of 32 appearances for Halifax Town.

Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects ( including her Dai Li agents ) in fear of betrayal, haunted by the memories of the human sacrifice that Azula made. She then summons the Zombies from the grave chamber to fight her loyal warriors - even though she's just a clone of her own dead body. The battle is not a win for Azula in the end as her loyal vassals are killed.\nThe final battle, Azula against the Son-king of Black Dragon ( not sure which version but it's still the Son-king ) is one with two powers. One power is like a dragon where the Son-king kills Azula with his poisonous spear. This battle is a win for Azula, but she sacrifices her human heart to gain the powers of the dragon. When she returns to her form as the Son-king it freezes her death for the moment. The Son-king freezes his own death and destroys his own soul. This powers has him regain the control of his soul. When the Son-king and Azula unite, only the weakest remains alive. With all Azula loyal vassals killed ( except for the one who brought me here ), and all the survivors are killed. The rest of the Zombies are killed ( except for the one that was there to protect me when I was a baby ).\nAs it turns out that all of Azula loyal vassals that were killed killed everyone except for the one who brought me here. This is my first real story.\nYou know, I thought about it for a while and I think Azula is just too strong and powerful. And all these loyal vassals that were killed were just protecting this powerful evil woman. So that leaves me. I am now the target and Azula is so powerful that she won't let me die until I betrayed her. Since the entire world is my enemy and the ones who are my friends they are just helping Azula against me? So I can't betray her in the end. So the only way out for me is to use my powers to kill everyone. To kill Azula first and kill all other people after her. Then all the loyalty ( Azula loyal vassals ) are gone. Only me and my loyal vassals are left. The rest are just Azula loyal vassals. So maybe the reason why Azula loyal vassals are killed is to make me a better leader when I will kill her. Maybe I can be the better one after Azula's defeat. Or maybe the loyal vassals are waiting for me to take their places.\nI'm just trying to understand but I don't think I can. Azula loyal vassals have more power than me in battle and if they come back to fight me, that's all I have - the battle will be over.\nSo I'm thinking they must be waiting for me to use the power that they have in a way I can't do it. The loyalty of the vassals are important. Their loyalty could save my life.","token_len":637,"entropy":[12.2877,7.002,3.4895,1.1994,3.6141,2.329,2.2963,9.708,4.6256,2.6829,8.3042,0.1534,4.0632,0.0171,2.3093,2.9688,0.0016,11.6687,0.018,9.0673,0.5489,0.9974,1.3702,5.539,4.7241,8.9461,2.0084,13.9036,3.666,7.1249,1.7418,3.2574,6.7751,0.4582,7.6959,2.0415,12.0111,0.0577,1.151,3.8035,0.3095,1.8238,6.7028,2.9837,2.0122,4.4627,0.006,2.4973,2.3662,1.9366,3.3738,5.7188,1.4133,11.2674,3.4548,0.9356,6.3062,11.2593,1.317,4.1161,1.8584,9.4827,5.904,5.9842,4.7893,1.4944,1.6753,3.673,4.7996,1.4709,4.5841,0.7793,1.5791,1.845,5.4146,2.1625,0.5001,2.5053,5.646,1.5293,4.3955,3.4365,6.0244,1.4143,1.5398,0.0054,4.9464,0.8778,0.8542,4.1302,2.515,6.308,7.4539,0.6352,0.0548,1.8326,1.8136,2.5464,1.2492,6.6475,4.017,1.2282,3.0742,5.1513,0.0065,7.3444,0.701,11.0297,3.7522,5.2957,1.3242,6.7409,3.9314,3.5064,7.842,3.8796,3.2781,2.6655,5.0961,2.3944,1.099,4.0197,3.238,4.965,0.3469,0.1368,3.8395,1.3689,4.0405,6.3595,5.1058,6.7433,1.4738,2.1515,2.8422,0.7873,6.9528,1.5432,5.8345,7.5817,1.4489,4.082,0.3776,0.0902,4.5522,3.2473,0.0031,2.6028,1.1273,7.2227,3.684,1.1662,2.6117,5.0522,0.8323,2.6663,4.5836,0.2229,0.6372,0.0048,2.0966,1.7873,2.5575,6.4834,1.3296,4.2507,5.7452,0.9285,4.2014,1.2924,4.3074,0.5252,0.8569,3.9419,0.7356,4.5998,1.7764,4.0563,0.4923,1.95,7.3441,3.2029,1.7129,2.0373,0.0503,0.0357,5.3949,8.1009,1.9828,7.4017,4.5948,2.2555,4.5929,0.8717,1.871,3.1563,0.0212,0.0174,6.9243,4.4849,1.9008,3.4405,2.1526,4.3787,2.4004,1.4201,2.4409,0.9066,2.6135,6.2904,4.1615,5.8911,6.8397,2.17,5.1445,0.4538,0.5855,3.1142,2.3297,3.3251,1.7828,1.5874,0.0073,0.0097,5.045,1.9736,0.002,4.8163,1.3772,6.2634,1.4647,8.4569,5.1986,2.871,0.6109,5.4471,3.3405,5.7514,0.0184,7.7066,5.9256,0.005,0.0366,2.2165,3.985,4.9087,0.8877,1.6064,3.8798,1.2591,5.4491,5.3963,3.3209,2.2816,3.3125,2.1083,1.4358,4.1219,5.6811,2.8625,4.6926,1.8338,5.3602,0.5459,0.2709,5.2616,1.3897,2.3499,3.8449,3.5028,0.4562,0.7497,1.0123,3.7597,3.9938,5.4809,1.5513,2.9003,1.1422,3.5523,0.5033,1.4401,3.9048,2.7314,2.1124,1.1573,4.8637,4.5417,1.4138,0.0015,3.9374,3.8369,1.1986,1.6419,0.0036,6.4189,0.2861,0.0044,0.0326,4.7089,1.8806,1.1764,6.4862,9.083,1.6979,1.228,0.8089,0.7529,0.6901,0.6624,0.1386,0.0725,1.3174,2.7781,1.431,5.7378,2.4661,3.3797,4.2068,2.2246,1.6221,5.3295,3.0842,1.6195,1.8193,4.1791,3.3826,1.5939,2.2989,0.4976,0.9744,1.803,1.8074,2.9807,4.1816,0.0068,2.2835,3.717,3.5911,2.2529,2.4993,2.8023,1.6105,3.6082,5.0017,3.796,6.8701,0.4427,0.0088,0.0441,2.1501,1.1839,0.715,2.3079,2.0721,8.3875,5.4068,5.6131,4.9892,5.4682,0.9963,2.5367,3.5858,6.3522,1.0505,3.3568,1.9411,4.2053,4.3469,2.9703,6.8133,4.4986,3.2079,0.0042,0.9094,5.3347,1.624,0.7367,1.2693,4.3967,0.0068,1.8353,0.7254,3.1316,4.7911,0.9019,10.3337,0.1158,0.5884,6.449,2.9676,6.459,1.3841,1.1599,5.338,1.7975,1.9265,3.5323,6.1974,1.29,2.4436,2.3379,2.2244,6.7941,1.6288,4.2811,6.0322,5.3113,0.0067,5.7281,1.0937,7.2991,2.8157,1.5043,3.2906,0.8694,6.5318,1.5352,4.4414,1.3467,0.6003,0.7906,2.5379,3.618,1.5277,0.6542,3.8699,2.9222,0.3734,0.1816,0.4138,4.2674,1.2311,1.428,0.8837,2.3389,2.9707,1.8066,5.4047,1.9099,2.7502,0.006,4.3533,1.7141,2.6271,1.5955,4.5991,2.8041,4.7017,3.1006,1.4411,3.4807,4.7755,1.1398,8.0555,5.7221,6.0521,0.005,1.6702,0.7095,0.0058,0.0602,0.6141,2.3118,3.5484,0.9148,5.7535,5.1098,1.0347,1.7277,4.0653,0.4255,0.0044,0.0325,1.5311,0.9709,0.628,3.204,3.3213,1.9604,2.1496,9.0243,0.0295,1.199,0.2876,0.0115,0.0141,1.6543,2.9005,6.1251,3.2638,4.1106,1.5141,2.2134,0.0044,3.0282,0.1741,0.0145,0.0174,1.0412,2.7714,0.5088,3.0189,3.0759,1.5024,2.704,3.0119,3.912,5.4882,1.062,4.8808,2.8658,2.0546,1.0836,4.1103,1.5751,1.8449,3.3855,2.0462,4.2044,4.2422,4.0426,3.5153,0.0087,2.9629,3.62,0.5665,3.59,0.2094,3.2026,9.1955,0.419,0.0063,0.0204,1.2569,6.0669,0.2871,0.4595,0.9392,3.7943,3.2842,4.6232,1.0899,1.4124,2.0839,2.6072,3.9817,2.8517,0.045,4.4011,5.9314,0.9315,2.2079,0.0008,2.6583,1.3056,1.2368,2.4138,4.481,0.0066,1.7226,0.0563,0.0077,0.023,3.568,5.4754,0.8118,0.3402,2.0792,4.189,4.7486,1.9606,4.0195,1.9007,5.6043,2.3643,1.7266,2.5656,1.514,2.0395,3.7205,1.2185,3.4118,1.1769,2.2847,6.4943,2.9794,6.2961,3.3911,0.8762,0.7363,0.8497,1.6402,2.5933,1.673,1.7364,3.7062,5.1948,4.4231,0.994,4.1748,0.2044,0.2508,0.6286,3.8534,3.0768,1.4259,2.9327,2.3982,0.9339,3.3724,4.7588,2.121,3.4987,1.126,1.0037,3.0275,4.9759,1.436,4.1484,6.8011,1.5098,1.0943,1.9977,0.0065,0.0283,2.6592,5.9008,1.9766,5.7352,0.9612,5.3515,4.6226,2.0014,0.3231,1.4305]}
{"prompt":"The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy , which has two elements : the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi . Pardons may eliminate","text":"The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements : the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate or at least mitigate judicial proceedings after sentences that would have otherwise resulted in imprisonment ( for serious crimes, even life imprisonment, a pardon may be granted ; for a lesser crime, a sentence of imprisonment may be reduced ).\nNolle prosequi is not a real prerogative ; but, like a pardon, it is a concession by the president of the republic to save the judicial system from the inconvenience of the trial of a defendant who, in spite of serious criminal activity, was unable to be identified.\nPresidential prerogative powers affect the judiciary more than any other branch. A presidential candidate cannot be a judge.\nThe constitutional mandate of a judge ends when the judge\u2019s office expires. It may vary but seldom extends beyond one or two years, although no limit is defined. The presidential mandate is different : the judiciary may not intervene within the presidential mandate.\nThe constitution grants constitutional prerogative powers to the judiciary. On the other hand, a judge\u2019s appointment depends on his own initiative. There are certain rules concerning his appointments ; his choice must include candidates from different social classes : the president must name candidates from the lower middle class, the bourgeois, and the upper middle class.\nThe election is based on the principle of merit ; it can include a qualified minority of men of color in positions of justice. The Constitutional Court may review a judge\u2019s qualifications.\nThe judiciary is a branch directly linked to the political office. It is not separated from governmental institutions (except for the Constitutional Court). Judges are obliged to comply with their political masters. The president, ministers, and their closest political associates are also judges.\nWe have learned in the foregoing section of constitutional law that judges are appointed by the president. He also appoints the judges of his own Court. These judges are elected at the same time as the president for a seven-year term. The president also appoints a judge in the Constitutional Court, a judge of the Electoral Court, a member of the Central Bank executive board, a member of the supreme council chaired by the head of the supreme military court, and an auditor general.\nEach president chooses an executive council of 24 members, made up of a president, four vice-presidents, and 15 members selected by the president from ministers and officials of various ministerial and presidential offices. It is a cabinet government. Judges do not seem to be the focus of the executive\u2019s attention.\nThe judicial system\u2019s system is based on a hierarchical system. Judges are divided into superior and inferior. Judges, except for the Constitutional Court, are given a title. The president can assign other judges the title of their office such as president of court, judge, or chief public prosecutor.\nPresidential courts are not independent, even though the president and some of the justices of these courts can be from different parties of government, a situation which does not generally occur.","token_len":637,"entropy":[5.8798,8.4851,8.2178,5.931,0.0281,8.696,3.6875,7.9727,1.3183,6.9552,1.3127,0.4526,0.8237,4.9619,0.0037,0.0088,0.7725,8.3287,1.6302,1.1831,3.3581,4.9982,4.3605,7.4522,2.0162,6.127,0.1306,2.8956,0.0025,1.6415,0.6113,2.1932,0.0146,7.5027,1.8363,0.9721,3.4624,0.1786,0.8713,1.8028,6.5677,0.5313,0.0093,4.3739,10.3586,3.2414,3.9426,0.2612,3.7045,5.3367,4.8164,7.1549,6.5874,5.135,3.0056,1.953,2.0875,4.129,0.278,3.68,4.147,8.0127,7.2034,1.2186,1.7744,5.4423,3.505,0.7764,1.8037,5.0649,3.3599,1.9326,1.1281,1.2634,5.6916,2.0117,3.7183,2.8162,1.4108,0.3315,1.2457,2.6832,1.5649,3.4056,0.7138,0.2104,2.8791,4.2507,2.8746,8.9928,0.189,0.0184,0.1827,0.0028,0.0572,1.5031,3.6812,1.61,5.7111,4.5001,0.0095,0.002,3.3931,4.3004,3.3684,3.4149,2.9338,2.1278,0.3449,0.4127,1.2283,2.2079,7.2197,3.7667,0.5766,4.6619,2.1251,0.1712,4.0998,0.9032,7.0345,1.0891,4.1288,0.5465,1.1549,2.5804,7.3179,0.4355,2.7463,5.2339,1.4477,2.1026,2.8315,2.1436,3.775,2.1338,3.6909,0.0111,5.8565,3.0241,3.5461,0.2485,3.1116,3.818,0.0972,3.105,5.7473,2.0377,1.4608,6.3826,0.9047,3.7205,0.0007,1.6251,2.5404,5.8288,1.1337,2.1076,3.1118,0.82,1.6665,0.2993,3.0153,3.6174,4.2298,3.5837,8.3957,3.83,1.2204,3.4006,3.028,2.789,2.2609,1.742,5.0085,7.013,0.85,2.4079,4.5423,7.7808,1.4615,1.0887,3.3755,14.6948,8.1376,3.0424,2.4028,2.9252,0.8531,3.7104,3.5982,6.7833,5.7442,6.6825,5.7883,1.1572,3.5608,4.133,0.2069,0.4135,2.0816,4.2213,4.9341,5.4445,0.8454,6.8404,0.7237,1.9917,4.8396,5.5478,2.2858,5.6782,7.8547,1.9547,4.7974,2.0535,2.2033,6.325,5.5932,1.2261,3.8189,2.6021,1.9862,0.9682,1.3569,4.7846,4.6093,5.8742,0.6168,0.0007,1.5985,0.8416,0.9774,0.941,3.7356,1.4242,6.374,0.8144,1.2765,0.0265,0.0681,2.2843,2.9312,4.2518,0.1406,0.0887,4.3546,5.5135,0.5065,2.6918,3.5632,6.1811,1.0488,4.3034,0.8338,4.1993,3.9006,3.9454,3.665,3.6387,4.6078,4.0692,4.9649,3.3111,5.1852,7.4324,2.6253,3.4192,5.719,1.6819,5.9268,2.3468,2.5557,2.6274,6.1141,2.6964,1.5444,1.3459,3.7349,3.2461,0.3352,1.3974,1.9429,9.8625,1.2217,1.302,0.6896,3.6714,0.2002,0.1408,0.8484,1.3671,1.2208,5.4885,3.8516,4.5609,0.215,0.9161,4.3172,0.6797,5.5636,3.3282,2.6733,3.8793,4.9457,2.5528,5.8786,5.1401,1.3385,4.368,3.7668,4.0033,4.1467,3.6998,0.2343,7.448,0.7581,1.5583,7.0592,3.0947,2.8722,5.696,2.5738,3.8238,0.756,0.0183,0.0541,4.2727,2.0895,0.9261,1.1441,3.2749,1.491,2.261,3.2284,8.5453,5.4222,0.1667,0.4147,3.4678,6.399,1.4931,1.4606,1.0085,2.4278,8.0384,0.3688,7.3146,3.0123,4.4896,4.2761,1.5927,1.0225,5.45,0.374,1.6697,5.9429,1.2136,7.2252,0.1102,4.7575,0.0564,3.9114,3.1924,3.8828,1.3395,1.9648,3.1752,2.8986,9.2138,0.265,0.7516,4.8652,8.0387,4.3214,1.534,1.2249,3.2464,3.0701,0.5447,0.7249,6.5549,1.8622,5.807,3.3867,1.1755,7.3028,4.5096,3.2055,5.3494,0.6265,0.3013,3.8246,1.0508,3.1371,0.6722,0.3987,0.9148,1.5036,5.3674,4.7104,1.6824,0.0061,2.6829,1.643,1.9954,2.3492,1.1626,7.3452,1.0319,4.4556,0.8297,0.8955,2.656,4.3348,0.7658,2.6243,0.1958,0.7898,0.5393,1.7373,5.1062,2.5221,6.711,0.2102,0.1228,0.088,0.5141,1.6135,1.5903,3.3395,0.7148,0.0011,3.0145,2.6551,3.6006,1.3214,5.4824,0.1026,2.2189,3.3787,2.4911,1.9569,0.6738,7.6766,3.207,0.2238,1.0774,5.4467,0.0041,0.1719,6.1095,5.6505,8.9419,2.1001,0.2011,1.4576,0.5631,0.0142,0.184,5.2544,5.6101,13.4241,0.006,0.4249,3.4543,0.0108,0.9564,4.6484,4.2477,2.7215,0.1538,0.8672,2.9019,7.1469,2.2568,0.9745,0.8673,4.5392,3.6749,5.1341,3.5978,3.9966,4.3417,2.6395,8.0045,0.9966,1.7314,6.2452,0.0195,0.1463,3.5569,3.6527,1.0351,3.9772,2.8963,1.1031,0.1755,0.0026,0.2357,2.1025,5.7581,1.3201,6.1232,0.5459,0.4453,0.7897,3.1541,10.5763,1.2384,4.2293,1.8673,2.7805,9.5204,1.2187,5.2956,2.86,0.2013,4.4983,0.4314,2.2313,5.3387,6.7224,1.5718,6.1741,4.4776,0.0371,7.353,0.139,1.1402,3.7599,4.9866,0.0492,1.4099,2.6014,13.4188,0.0354,0.1016,4.2958,0.5408,0.891,1.0547,3.8728,1.0289,5.5376,0.0262,0.0513,4.4975,1.4043,2.9794,0.2306,1.9624,6.6755,1.2458,1.8621,3.5813,0.8873,4.5179,0.1928,8.6807,0.6623,0.1034,5.5441,3.8605,4.0023,6.4871,1.0147,0.8104,4.5723,0.0164,0.1977,0.6742,4.6311,2.3165,6.4819,2.6437,1.266,1.9033,3.9203,4.6993,5.9668,0.2841,4.5023,2.5227,0.5134,5.7158,5.0718,8.0042,0.1329,4.9782,0.9427,5.4129,0.8125,3.3661,3.4138,1.3299,4.2645,8.3492,0.7237,0.2855,1.3408,3.9208,0.0464,5.2934,0.9771,2.5742,3.6557,2.8128,5.888,0.7512,1.903,1.9928,4.1072,4.4674,0.8368,1.2875,3.8414,1.3708,7.3634,0.4806,4.1,1.0214,5.6561,0.6109,3.7046,5.119,5.1527,3.2681,5.1456,3.8972,1.4487,3.5651,0.0137,6.3649,1.5364,1.1393]}

The purpose of the lease was to provide a facility in NewYork with which to carry on governmental relations. Under Section 101 of the 1940 Act, a lease can be used by a government to conduct any public official business, including international. The Government decided in 1948 to renew its lease for the U. S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Robert E. Lee, using his office space as a base of operations. Because of the lease's status as Section 101, no permit was required to carry on the official business of the government and it was not necessary to file a \" request for occupancy \" as required under Section 102. The use of the Lease continued as far as the present with little change in the basic structure. An additional use during the last few years has been to permit certain officials of the UN Secretariat to reside away from their official addresses while attending meetings at the New York office where their duties have been assigned.\nA few years ago the State Department moved its headquarters from the West 55th Street offices, occupied since 1935 and located just off New York City's famed Grand Central Station, to West 41st and West 44th Street where the U. S. Agency for International Development is located.\nThe rent has always been based on a market evaluation and, as with other government properties, increases must be accompanied with proposals for expenditures to increase occupancy or maintain occupancy. To the extent possible, rent increases are based on actual unit expenditures through administrative budget revisions and, where appropriate, on rent increases announced by competing properties for similar units. This approach ensures that rent increases are reasonable and will not adversely affect future occupancy.\nThe annual lease rate for the United States Government Section 101 lease is about $1, 000 per square foot. The rent is paid by way of an installment agreement, using payments in quarterly installments over the course of ten years or so. There is no charge for the use of telephone in the New York telephone system which is fully maintained and paid for by the U. S. government. The U. S. government has also paid for telephone, electric, gas, and water, and janitorial services. The State Department pays utility bills to the same agents as the Government Agency for International Development. A detailed and comprehensive accounting was maintained from July, 1946, through December, 1950, which is described in the Financial Report that accompanies this document. The income tax records are being checked presently.\nThe occupancy of the premises has, of course, fluctuated somewhat during the more than fifty years of occupation. The area occupied in 1950 was about 19,500 square feet. The space occupied in 1949 was about 17,550 square feet. The unit space has never been less than 18,050 square feet, but in 1952 the total area occupied was only 16,960 square feet.

All the birds in the groups will be alerted, but each bird receives information from a smaller number of more closely monitored individuals in the group. Thus, birds might learn more about the risk of predation in the small groups and use these information to adjust their spatial distribution within the group. This would explain why, with increasing group size, birds more often locate themselves at the outer edge of lek groups.\nIn conclusion, the observations in the present study on white-browed sparrows suggest that this species has learned where a lek group is safe. This suggests that it has acquired knowledge about the predation risk in a particular lek by using the lek group as information source and\/or by learning from interactions with other birds.\nSummary\nIn this study we investigated the use of lek groups as information sources by white-browed sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys fusca, and its implications for the lek attendance pattern and lek density in the lekking species. Our findings suggest that white-browed sparrows can learn the predation risk in a lek group before they visit them in the autumn. We found that many of the birds that locate themselves at the edge of the lek groups have a low lek attendance. The birds near the lek groups, which have a low lek attendance, usually attend the lek groups just before the lek opening. The birds located near the lek groups at the lek opening are probably using the lek closing time as a cue to locate the groups. We also found that birds locate themselves close to the lek groups at the lek closing time when the group sizes are small.\nOur findings on the lek group use by white-browed sparrows have implications for the lek attendance of the species. We expect that white-browed sparrows will locate themselves at the edges of lek groups with low frequency of lek attendance during the lek opening and closing periods in the autumn. Thus, the birds should experience less risk of predation in the lek groups with low frequency of lek attendance than in groups with regular lek attendance. The higher proportion of individuals that locate themselves at the edge of groups with a short lek closing time than of groups with a long lek closing time might also enhance the efficiency of lek group attendance. This is because the smaller size of the groups with a short lek closing time might cause the birds to attend a wider area of the group during the lek closing period. However, the birds should locate themselves close to the lek groups with a longer closing time when they are located away from the lek group. Therefore, if a bird is located away from an lek group, it should attend this lek group before the closing time if its lek attendance is low. Consequently, the efficiency of lek group attendance might partly depend on the predation risk and lek group size.","token_len":637,"entropy":[9.7726,10.4517,7.1316,10.0227,3.9585,1.2673,3.272,4.0469,0.5033,6.5327,0.1136,1.9519,2.574,3.1677,3.9994,7.4847,1.9336,1.8443,5.203,3.7709,9.6206,1.6628,3.7309,3.5542,3.1197,3.2839,0.897,0.9646,6.2346,2.9008,5.0429,1.9838,0.5502,5.1153,2.9604,1.7995,4.0073,2.7522,1.4611,5.5831,1.7223,7.5663,5.0156,1.5203,2.1495,4.6455,2.358,0.1852,6.6186,4.8612,4.3898,1.5939,3.5271,0.5301,0.5784,0.342,4.8118,0.6614,3.7917,5.9787,5.6798,2.5689,0.5012,1.4402,5.997,0.2647,0.397,0.0023,2.4158,1.356,3.6284,2.0517,2.2965,5.3993,3.5627,0.7354,0.2065,6.1433,0.3841,8.5739,3.8837,5.8499,0.5114,0.9205,0.3827,2.9049,4.2771,4.374,0.8682,3.6148,3.9865,4.5326,5.1058,0.2249,0.1956,2.1774,5.6185,0.9965,5.4467,3.8706,3.2763,1.5532,6.4812,1.2556,0.0197,8.0212,0.1425,0.4767,0.9699,1.3243,10.1729,5.6648,0.1202,1.5787,5.9893,2.2416,1.6576,2.2923,0.1364,5.9616,6.9257,0.8598,6.7804,0.0203,5.714,0.0506,0.2142,2.5682,0.1668,4.693,1.7368,2.0962,6.0177,7.0153,4.818,5.6331,0.2837,2.5807,0.9181,6.8198,2.3098,2.1704,3.9511,0.1359,3.2922,2.0291,4.3084,2.9778,1.0971,1.1605,5.5731,0.0173,1.0335,1.8534,2.6491,5.5362,2.6017,0.0068,7.3183,2.944,2.189,5.5775,0.1256,1.872,1.6615,6.2747,3.6977,2.8572,5.1274,0.0005,2.3287,4.3762,2.0953,7.5193,1.3897,1.2773,2.1037,0.8546,1.7695,5.6995,1.9508,2.2882,1.5481,1.5583,1.5735,3.1486,0.5773,4.8047,0.0684,3.2835,0.1364,1.4763,2.0254,1.1763,0.1743,2.7861,1.932,0.0338,0.2557,0.0011,0.1817,0.0002,0.0223,2.503,9.1636,7.7169,5.0185,2.6955,1.1662,4.264,3.4623,3.0121,5.23,6.957,2.3717,2.5682,1.4431,1.499,5.336,6.396,0.1214,1.4759,5.0776,0.307,13.522,3.5996,2.6122,4.2344,0.1928,6.0575,1.1591,1.4601,5.3697,0.153,8.867,5.137,1.0439,3.368,1.7055,1.4341,0.0796,2.6756,0.0158,0.1151,0.0005,0.0473,0.0008,0.0504,3.4072,1.3786,3.067,2.9329,0.0041,0.2766,1.2304,1.367,1.828,0.007,0.6712,6.6814,1.7662,5.809,6.2758,2.4523,1.2174,8.7507,1.2929,1.9939,2.0645,0.3037,5.1541,1.2132,0.3278,1.5885,2.9625,8.0546,0.3876,1.4545,0.2466,3.7412,0.0085,1.2738,0.6013,0.0081,1.7809,3.0271,2.7761,4.1548,3.7349,0.0178,7.2843,2.7685,2.8876,3.8651,6.4484,0.5436,2.8518,0.0344,0.8268,3.7667,2.912,2.7301,1.7109,2.1151,1.5847,0.004,3.426,0.4047,5.1196,4.797,1.9299,3.0571,0.1057,2.6073,6.1729,1.3158,1.1527,2.6073,0.0512,7.5755,1.4589,2.5974,1.9399,4.9492,1.0679,0.1382,0.5102,0.0095,0.1252,5.2872,0.8141,3.3037,0.1604,1.2361,1.5993,4.5467,5.7995,1.1428,0.6063,0.0205,9.4379,3.1202,1.7334,0.5906,2.3401,0.5848,3.1697,2.4534,4.4371,1.429,2.2834,1.5637,0.4077,0.1761,3.6101,6.2101,1.2377,4.0899,0.1044,0.3463,0.7726,0.0135,1.2738,1.9635,0.4183,1.0037,0.0224,2.663,0.2863,3.7007,1.4161,2.0864,5.4294,0.8577,2.1143,0.7606,2.0469,3.5358,1.2671,4.8898,1.2004,2.7347,0.0101,1.7596,3.4321,2.5865,0.3884,0.0049,0.0206,0.0003,0.0095,0.0011,0.0082,4.1801,1.1095,0.0537,0.8406,1.7016,0.0065,2.5426,2.9376,2.6188,2.3226,0.7147,1.7484,4.334,0.4164,2.9006,0.0058,0.0314,0.0004,0.0126,0.0025,0.0178,0.7626,5.0756,1.1808,1.4799,0.2529,2.0644,0.0305,0.7121,0.0396,0.0762,4.3069,2.9992,5.9309,2.9861,1.1845,0.0345,3.0143,5.06,0.2951,3.0271,0.0156,0.7475,2.4579,7.9211,2.8899,4.1473,0.7611,1.0449,0.464,4.8467,0.1206,1.965,2.763,3.8072,6.0899,3.788,3.5956,0.3185,0.2079,0.002,1.3972,0.4958,1.4821,0.007,0.3374,4.0493,0.9426,2.2315,0.1327,0.1242,0.002,0.0312,3.0714,1.0195,3.4963,0.5269,6.7003,0.8448,0.0057,0.1459,0.3346,2.7794,5.0293,5.5251,0.021,4.6956,2.1497,2.2685,0.122,1.0997,0.0502,1.2812,0.0151,4.7743,0.5433,3.9931,6.6565,0.235,0.0018,2.3868,0.1205,3.9292,6.1797,0.2808,0.1474,2.5589,0.9221,0.1019,0.0017,0.5135,0.0148,2.9156,2.8739,6.247,0.3305,6.3316,0.1628,2.1715,0.0303,2.8821,3.634,0.6321,3.0297,2.3898,3.1815,1.4354,4.168,3.2156,0.0859,0.5207,1.8168,2.5904,1.9543,0.8355,0.1526,0.0016,0.5931,0.0496,1.9354,4.5721,1.7756,0.5457,0.15,5.7467,3.973,3.8769,2.1292,1.168,0.6056,1.0917,4.5023,0.2586,0.9756,0.0035,1.7677,2.8789,0.5658,3.6185,0.0042,1.5723,3.2164,3.5701,6.0567,0.1446,2.0809,0.0519,0.4096,0.8769,0.0063,0.3402,1.347,1.2373,2.4894,3.3752,0.0281,3.7577,2.2899,0.8392,4.9398,7.4803,0.0047,0.3374,0.9879,0.0038,1.5543,0.4565,3.9503,0.0357,3.1659,2.5293,1.9451,1.2022,1.7576,4.9506,0.0072,3.2843,3.5213,0.0029,0.077,1.1637,1.0725,1.5442,5.4266,5.7107,2.3829,0.0027,0.1938,5.0477,1.6317,5.3173,0.1941,4.0675,4.1031,2.3579,0.0025,2.7326,0.4384,0.7425,0.3802,6.7446,0.0123,1.3597,6.977,0.0957,1.1769,0.0051,0.0754,0.3378,2.8287,7.609,2.1225,0.0658,0.3462,8.0129,0.0024,1.9038,3.568,4.0609,0.0027,2.2894,0.4532,0.4986]}
{"prompt":"At dawn on 29 June , the rebels attacked the Usta\u0161e in a village on the Mostar \u2013 Nevesinje road . Prohaska demanded help from Mostar , and planned to send a force from Nevesinje","text":"At dawn on 29 June, the rebels attacked the Usta\u0161e in a village on the Mostar \u2013 Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje, headed by Petar Stano, on a relief march to \u010cukalj. Mostar ordered the rebels to stop but the rebels continued fighting.\nPetar Stano and the rebels of Nevesinje attacked Stano's column, but were stopped before they reached \u010cukalj. The rebels then attacked the Usta\u0161a garrison at \u010capljina, killing more than a dozen soldiers. The rebels managed to reach the Usta\u0161a camp at Brdno, and killed a number of Usta\u0161e, among them Petar Petrovi\u0107. Stano and the rebels then returned to Mostar and the siege of the camp at Brdno ended on 29 June. A meeting of the rebels in Mostar on 30 June produced the decision to take up arms.\nThe rebels were given weapons which they used mainly against the Usta\u0161e and the Bosnian Serb Partizan partisans. According to reports, the rebels used small arms and two-man mortars in this battle. For some weeks, the Usta\u0161e controlled about 80% of Mostar, while the rebels controlled the rest. On 21 July, the rebels attacked the Usta\u0161a positions in Mostar on three fronts once again, and recaptured much of the city. On 24 July, the rebels attacked the Usta\u0161a positions a third time, capturing some towns but failing to capture Mostar. The Usta\u0161e recaptured some cities and destroyed others, but on 5 August, the rebels recaptured Mostar once again. The rebels soon recaptured \u010cukalj (2 August), followed by Velika Kladusa (11 August). On 30 August, the rebels captured the Usta\u0161a bridge of Mostar, while on 16 September, the rebels recaptured the Usta\u0161a bridge in Novi Be\u010dej, and on 19 September in Manjaca. After the capture of Mostar, there has been a growing tension between the rebels and the Usta\u0161e. After the rebels took over Manjaca, the Usta\u0161e shot down the rebel fighter Vlatko Gani\u010devi\u0107, killing him. The rebels were also unable to use a bridge that was built by Americans at Vr\u0161avci, causing an air strike on 18 September and a U.N. patrol crossing from Zagreb to Mostar (the second such patrol). On 12 October, the rebels captured the Usta\u0161a airfield at Danjovica. On 18 December, after the rebels had taken over the airfield and captured most of Mostar, the rebels and their civilians were forced out by the Usta\u0161e.

He moved on to Wrexham where he played for 3 years.\nAfter the break he came back to Stoke as a coach. Having never really had the coaching bug he decided to take up the job in his father-in-law Peter Brown's team.\nHe had to make do with a few games as the team was struggling at the back and finished 12th in the table. As a coach he had to make do with only 18 goals in 39 games.\nHe was the coach when Stoke finished 8th in 1992 and lost the league to Liverpool.\nHis longest spell with the club came in 1994 when he led them to 5th in the league.

Great for fine work on timber to give you even the finest work.\nI know I have been here a while now but I will just start over here. All I know is, I'm sick of trying to find people online on my own. Now that I am in a position that I can find other sex dating personals, I am ready and willing to meet someone.\nWhen I see you I will know. So if I catch your eye. I want to hear where we go from here and see where our lives may take us.\nI am not into bondage. I am not into the extreme stuff. I am not into the dirty talking either. I don't need a man that tries to put me down and makes me feel that it is okay. I am not the woman to do that for anyone. If you wish to play dirty I also do.\nI don't want to play games with anyone. I don't know what the other types mean, but I want a man who is open minded and ready to please. I do not feel like I need to pretend to be your favorite girl. I do not want to go through life knowing he is playing games, and he does not actually like me.\nI am looking forward to the future. I am ready and willing to settle down with someone who knows what he wants, knows what he is looking for, and is ready and willing to have fun together.\nIf you think about all you see on the Internet. The list of things women are doing to make a man feel like he gets laid more, it just seems like the list is endless.\nThere just seems to be something missing that makes a man feel good about being with a woman. It sounds like you are a guy, but I know I can be very direct with a man.\nIt takes a little of both to bring out the best in a man, but the man that loves me is my best man. I want you to feel that I am your person for a man, but it does not make it any easier. So I ask if you are ready to go to bed, eat dinner, and keep the romance alive with us. I want to know what it is like to have a partner like you because all I have is the internet.","token_len":638,"entropy":[7.9694,11.6903,6.0302,4.4769,11.7532,4.1263,5.8655,10.6346,6.5891,3.6075,2.0099,0.6831,0.8999,0.1649,0.9991,0.4937,0.5297,0.1648,4.4224,1.6429,10.1486,6.0688,3.3665,2.7002,4.4192,6.9499,0.8668,4.3608,2.4696,1.4199,0.8666,0.3061,0.1305,0.6297,3.424,0.2978,8.2692,5.6519,0.8493,8.2457,2.4981,8.7513,2.688,2.3659,4.0233,0.0117,4.8805,3.472,6.5413,6.202,3.7925,2.101,3.9629,3.0749,5.2369,1.4171,0.9068,3.5455,2.655,6.4287,0.7341,3.4644,0.9837,8.5539,0.7041,8.8131,1.6636,0.3518,0.7141,4.3991,1.4249,0.1989,1.1003,0.0705,6.0193,9.4881,0.0593,8.5666,4.3758,5.6582,0.402,3.2019,0.8811,4.4755,2.0318,5.8153,0.7455,1.6013,5.9593,6.768,1.1559,2.6662,0.7763,3.1878,0.9437,1.4726,0.1822,0.2307,1.8721,1.3892,0.0258,0.0704,1.4317,2.8735,5.8206,12.2811,6.3924,7.9758,2.4809,1.873,3.0482,4.8249,0.0582,0.5334,7.2995,5.8833,0.3528,0.4832,3.1628,4.2456,0.8218,4.3537,6.7137,6.2294,7.4978,1.6257,6.9231,6.5209,2.5925,0.2879,5.9697,0.2869,11.1225,0.6483,5.7656,1.9278,0.9586,3.7332,5.2664,6.4152,12.0608,0.0217,1.6846,2.1864,2.0482,2.6112,4.7253,4.867,2.4088,5.9048,6.3504,2.4746,0.0343,4.1182,2.4347,2.3824,0.9487,0.0405,3.9646,4.5001,2.8638,4.8279,2.5337,4.5742,3.0553,2.7957,0.0262,7.6586,0.3367,1.3655,2.7591,0.1377,0.8286,6.6757,0.7167,7.2547,2.7565,2.5653,9.2972,5.5553,4.6068,1.056,4.4864,3.5958,4.106,3.2323,2.0587,1.8164,5.98,4.6679,2.4971,2.2746,2.1365,5.8962,1.7666,2.1559,1.5711,2.464,1.122,4.5088,4.4974,4.8763,4.1725,2.5229,1.105,5.2961,2.7628,2.7021,0.3564,3.8731,1.9527,3.3359,6.9661,0.2964,5.1561,0.1608,2.6092,5.9708,7.1272,5.8166,3.4119,1.2147,1.3599,5.2465,1.7362,0.6093,2.2583,3.3009,2.6922,1.4531,4.5922,1.0925,1.0225,3.6747,4.5304,10.7123,9.9639,10.7229,6.4649,1.6131,0.5101,1.8944,3.1771,4.3188,0.5085,0.0322,4.7354,3.2547,1.5532,2.0832,5.1398,1.0342,4.7771,2.4166,3.0945,2.2105,4.3291,3.0589,4.4356,3.1238,3.0972,6.2298,3.8841,2.5312,4.2757,2.1113,3.3782,0.3687,2.7124,5.7143,5.8763,2.9918,2.0066,0.0589,3.1256,4.4984,1.989,4.3427,2.7984,4.7461,1.3786,0.0156,0.3866,1.2572,2.446,1.7897,3.2187,6.3692,6.306,1.7519,0.694,1.049,1.1145,0.1621,3.7832,6.4091,4.1671,0.8947,0.4586,0.5074,0.6419,0.1419,1.782,6.626,6.2245,7.3697,0.1718,0.5029,3.4598,0.001,3.4331,2.7106,4.2435,4.2178,5.6169,0.1473,4.3143,1.3338,1.1452,2.5557,5.0444,0.2528,1.3038,4.1364,4.1473,0.9497,1.684,1.6196,0.5369,1.262,0.7677,4.1672,6.7059,3.1371,2.7345,0.9481,4.3676,4.1747,0.7726,3.7176,1.2517,5.2065,0.3455,6.0088,6.7648,2.4647,6.5786,2.9798,4.2529,1.5605,1.3364,3.6486,0.0014,1.7116,0.551,4.1121,5.1758,1.5459,2.3638,0.5733,0.5363,1.1836,0.0006,4.833,1.3101,2.9101,4.801,8.5544,7.0773,3.1887,0.9227,0.7956,2.5249,3.5143,2.3756,1.6775,1.5527,4.2327,4.0774,0.8739,6.0334,0.0982,6.5186,0.9905,0.9964,2.7479,0.6137,4.9887,0.942,1.0484,1.75,0.573,5.3391,1.0678,0.3617,4.8024,6.2153,3.2993,1.1006,0.469,1.8424,0.3315,1.004,0.4539,4.2575,2.8236,3.0152,4.7679,6.2989,1.0826,4.9597,3.0193,4.3416,2.565,3.4671,3.0482,0.8605,6.4036,2.2779,0.9886,0.5219,1.8424,0.7461,1.5665,4.5465,1.3361,0.008,3.6187,4.5626,0.772,0.9283,1.0259,3.9119,2.2404,0.2436,0.053,5.7456,0.3283,2.0709,1.6572,1.5046,3.309,1.2355,1.5434,1.6339,2.5539,4.8271,0.6745,0.2743,2.5123,1.4189,0.0468,0.582,0.2256,2.0062,2.8772,3.1584,0.0591,0.0165,4.0642,2.4547,3.3792,0.2037,0.9011,2.9822,0.4479,4.4935,3.7099,4.3254,4.7161,4.952,1.3514,1.0536,2.513,4.1253,3.5555,5.1395,2.0096,2.3825,6.5791,2.4434,3.0982,2.4679,2.5728,3.2929,0.8518,1.0731,2.1556,1.1666,6.8163,5.1057,5.9258,2.7744,4.2823,4.1493,3.513,1.725,2.9892,2.3475,1.47,2.0072,0.185,1.8633,4.0481,6.2331,1.9707,0.0911,0.0413,3.7852,2.1323,3.0945,2.1026,2.5105,0.2676,0.9173,3.0726,0.4248,3.3944,2.1987,1.263,0.686,0.629,2.2827,4.4371,1.0186,3.2431,1.1525,3.4732,3.998,2.1229,0.8352,2.4151,2.6258,2.3704,4.8653,2.919,4.7546,7.8682,1.4542,2.5588,1.9383,1.1627,1.899,3.5019,4.7174,0.9461,3.2728,5.35,2.8063,1.1525,5.325,3.1276,0.5342,0.8317,0.1394,1.1078,0.8383,2.4136,0.8972,3.2417,4.1315,3.6148,4.4556,1.0284,2.026,3.1731,2.8328,4.855,0.25,1.549,3.0544,2.5051,0.1236,2.7599,1.6485,3.5075,1.1357,1.8945,6.8897,4.4888,3.0173,4.5781,1.8545,3.7012,3.4287,3.3194,0.5435,3.3654,3.1039,1.5475,0.4095,0.9264,5.1238,2.3454,4.5396,3.8061,0.1426,2.4045,2.4662,0.3515,2.9827,2.3776,2.1743,3.4572,6.7316,2.3874,0.4813,1.7376,5.7706,2.9016,6.7912,3.0948,2.0469,4.284,0.5216,1.8636,1.4707,1.3786,2.1405,1.6377,2.3553,0.9583,0.6019,0.4379,1.7478,0.9924,5.0395,3.8033,0.7296,6.4431,5.4175,1.8444,2.7144,1.9319,2.4859,6.1664,0.7385]}

{"prompt":"Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics . Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement , Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause","text":"Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in the contract that paid them for the first three months the story were in production, after an attempt came up dry.\nMoore used the story from the beginning. Moore claimed that the story was developed in the late 1980s, which was probably correct, and it was drawn in the early 1990s. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nThe original version of the story, which appeared in the pages of Batman # 28, was drawn by Jim Aparo, and the story features mostly adult characters but has a child protagonist. In another instance, Batman is a child in the first book, while in the subsequent books he becomes older while remaining childlike. Both stories describe a child Batman that is older Batman that has come back to life, but they also use the back story of the first appearance of the DC superhero.\nThe story was referenced in the DC Comics Rebirth continuity, although the main character never went by the name Bruce Wayne, but only by his pseudonym, \"Batman.\" Similarly, a story that would be part of the \"Big Bang\" storylines by Jack Kirby and Dave Cockrum, which began in Batman # 40, would use this title but again it was \"Batman\" with no other real title or description, as these stories were part of Kirby's and Cockrum's \"Big Bang\" line, which was to have been written by him.\nHowever, the second version of the story was written and subsequently drawn by Keith Giffen and J.M.\nGiffen and is the real, current version of the story, although it has changed somewhat over time. The story was not drawn before the Batman # 35 -38, which was drawn by Ed McGuinness and Dave Cockrum.\nThe two stories were the result of Batman having an accident and his friends saving him. In the original version of the story, the accident is caused by the Black Mask, in which he enters The Dentist's Dentist, he shoots a machine gun, causing a small explosion that causes the Dentist to lose something from his head and he becomes Batman by accident.\nThe story was originally written by Bill Finger and Bob Kane as part of the Batman Adventures ongoing series and was later redesigned and redrawn in Batman # 34 by Jack Kirby and Dave Cockrum.\nThe original story was told through what is known as a Flashpoint, which is when the events of the past or future of a story happen to the current timeline. In one instance that this method is used with the Batman books is when the Batman and Robin stories in these books are told through Flashbacks.\nThe stories later had an animated continuation, as well as some other ongoing stories about the main character being Batman. These stories continued until Batman # 58, in which Batman was released from the Dentist's Dentist, and after that, there were other ongoing stories that told the origin of Batman, until he was officially released from the hospital in Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #4.","token_len":640,"entropy":[6.329,3.7499,4.0598,1.8276,6.9205,0.4255,1.5067,8.0084,8.9988,2.2814,9.2228,0.1645,8.0864,0.8531,0.1403,6.8662,0.561,1.6301,7.0976,4.6,0.2706,5.5246,3.8233,2.1424,7.7152,6.0399,0.8278,4.0502,0.7268,0.8041,4.0304,10.6449,0.3094,4.0786,1.7557,8.3554,6.6893,7.0038,0.8492,1.9923,1.0719,0.874,7.5135,1.0268,3.9726,1.9423,3.2446,2.2531,1.4896,6.1585,0.7614,6.1812,3.0678,1.3416,1.7801,4.8799,6.2821,5.3193,8.721,1.6917,8.6179,1.1014,1.4628,13.2607,6.6697,1.2863,3.2034,5.7515,1.3696,2.8203,4.4331,4.7429,5.3456,1.0064,1.5589,1.7045,0.8156,5.3488,2.4502,2.0513,3.1223,2.2957,0.1581,1.8186,4.082,1.7368,5.0917,2.9628,1.1183,3.1,3.7718,1.0004,7.2647,1.3726,1.7714,1.2223,0.4783,0.01,0.8546,5.8292,6.1746,1.251,2.4138,9.4905,1.678,3.9808,1.4333,3.3192,3.6674,2.9846,0.3112,0.5672,0.2682,2.6858,1.881,3.8228,0.5413,1.5797,5.5167,0.1457,5.043,3.3712,10.8207,1.2344,1.4197,3.7909,0.8433,3.5964,4.8263,0.8998,1.5611,1.4201,2.0631,2.0485,2.207,6.8799,7.677,7.072,1.373,4.4997,3.1777,1.6304,4.5813,3.9782,1.541,3.045,5.5556,4.2731,0.2306,3.5608,3.1016,3.6462,2.5509,2.7403,1.2999,2.7317,3.5616,1.0033,2.6271,1.4068,0.3341,5.2047,1.7513,1.3782,3.4396,5.1537,5.9993,6.7309,4.3064,1.5445,0.4971,4.9742,1.9841,6.9955,1.7683,2.3409,4.0766,3.9418,1.6095,5.4748,12.014,4.5849,2.3861,5.1414,3.7835,0.7611,0.6145,2.5309,1.5956,4.7666,2.8059,3.8603,1.2697,8.682,1.0314,1.2527,1.2959,2.4894,7.0266,0.2922,1.2539,5.2338,4.2733,1.4389,0.9987,1.9516,1.5867,1.4876,6.0368,0.5848,1.6786,2.9624,0.6913,5.6579,3.8859,1.1962,4.3689,1.9511,4.6759,0.8744,4.115,4.8373,6.2372,1.0667,0.4061,3.7892,0.0461,1.973,3.3628,4.8991,1.6547,1.7308,6.4746,2.0318,2.8093,2.1519,1.2833,7.357,0.0689,4.0769,3.4337,2.6788,4.231,2.3787,3.8897,0.0138,0.578,3.9588,7.1532,2.6421,0.7877,5.8825,4.9039,5.2471,0.0732,1.853,4.3358,4.8085,1.3005,1.5727,2.6331,4.3202,0.7253,4.7242,0.3416,4.8511,0.5175,2.6005,4.4506,3.5262,3.4581,4.5545,6.7701,4.2522,1.2251,5.5675,1.3317,1.1636,4.0534,2.8074,3.0264,5.743,2.3629,3.1343,4.9937,2.3474,2.7741,5.3848,0.8595,1.1957,4.5644,0.005,4.4169,0.1056,3.7435,0.0506,0.0001,0.0068,2.2351,1.6896,0.1463,0.2269,5.3513,2.6917,1.7421,1.7285,4.5633,3.8655,1.3463,3.2639,0.5431,4.6776,0.9023,0.864,5.2925,0.0362,1.6717,5.6312,2.675,0.3494,0.175,0.1909,1.5485,3.4364,4.1316,6.246,3.8443,0.2219,7.2746,4.3824,1.0642,0.9796,2.34,5.4855,0.9323,2.9848,0.0319,7.5942,4.0868,0.4192,0.0022,1.73,10.8523,2.4886,6.4759,6.6833,4.5466,4.3725,0.2055,0.5883,1.0195,1.5411,3.5069,1.8081,2.7233,3.4323,3.6788,2.1042,0.7666,0.5747,2.1034,1.9421,1.5517,4.2667,2.7749,5.2955,1.2769,4.0575,1.9876,5.474,7.7077,6.0836,2.9741,1.7625,1.2549,2.9403,0.6205,5.5291,5.0575,1.1118,1.4685,5.2141,0.143,0.0037,1.2517,1.2423,1.6016,5.1532,1.9382,1.5352,4.0432,4.6106,0.0054,8.0638,4.4246,3.6045,3.4672,2.1092,4.3958,4.8334,5.5085,0.5703,1.5887,2.9545,0.9491,3.0119,1.31,0.9801,0.1392,0.1592,0.1795,1.5099,2.1927,2.6346,3.2732,0.0933,2.189,6.9839,1.8399,1.6965,5.3813,1.2409,2.4334,5.8745,6.2141,7.2151,0.1741,0.2132,7.2847,0.9211,4.2702,5.8258,6.7362,2.1802,6.9898,0.5113,2.2483,4.1784,1.8206,4.7145,0.6402,2.2502,2.3943,1.4707,1.3508,0.0098,0.2795,2.9525,8.6846,4.6779,0.7201,4.0668,2.322,3.8418,3.6126,3.2733,6.0156,1.7687,0.3493,1.3314,1.4638,1.671,0.987,2.5066,2.2668,0.7561,5.8014,1.4184,1.4236,4.5989,0.7555,4.1799,1.8608,0.0015,1.0679,2.6948,3.8298,7.6226,0.7156,3.3163,1.2497,2.0509,6.2695,2.5684,3.7127,0.8341,2.2303,2.8172,0.4435,4.3794,3.1882,4.152,0.1107,0.724,0.8165,0.0013,0.0014,0.4287,1.0524,1.4783,2.3139,1.4993,0.9618,5.8125,4.8286,6.9611,1.5082,1.042,0.0779,1.9058,4.8313,1.4178,2.3215,1.6923,1.5911,3.9622,1.309,3.3334,0.4245,0.7364,4.7532,6.0286,1.6301,2.3204,2.8986,2.1889,3.4126,2.6614,1.9519,4.3023,4.1001,0.7227,2.3178,4.141,2.5193,5.7127,5.4772,7.8509,1.7986,0.3665,5.3919,1.1786,2.8982,4.6707,3.7154,2.9288,1.5275,3.1621,3.0448,1.1348,3.8205,4.6069,6.3861,1.3399,1.2629,2.5462,1.3125,1.2727,7.8983,1.1846,1.0778,1.5061,4.6175,6.8147,5.4521,3.6683,5.9044,7.2953,1.6535,3.4303,2.6442,0.216,3.5403,3.2099,6.296,1.325,6.0095,0.9584,5.6956,1.8649,6.0893,2.3146,0.958,3.6064,1.4294,4.9972,3.6064,2.4,0.6391,5.7954,0.99,3.0084,0.0431,2.4685,2.3115,4.8455,1.8862,2.2285,7.718,0.0467,0.5518,1.0915,0.114,1.7951,1.0858,4.4314,1.2456,1.6859,4.4675,1.9074,2.489,2.4194,0.4481,2.423,5.8408,0.991,3.69,0.9167,1.5424,1.9405,6.4076,2.4805,0.8722,5.342,1.007,0.9376,0.4366,3.6313,2.492,1.8862,3.1296,0.8319,6.0006,0.3012,3.8108,0.0067,3.1815,4.2518,0.735]}
{"prompt":"Carre 's Grammar School was founded on 1 September 1604 by way of an indenture between Robert Carre , a member of the Carr or Carre family , and several local gentlemen . Carre granted","text":"Carre's Grammar School was founded on 1 September 1604 by way of an indenture between Robert Carre, a member of the Carr or Carre family, and several local gentlemen. Carre granted his friends the use of the former St Gregory\u2019s Church in King Street, near the south-west end of the town, and by indenture, to render this church a free benefice, they agree that in respect of its benefice there should be a minister regularly appointed there. A church, accordingly, was built in King Street by the friends of Robert Carre and in the year 1605 was opened to worship by the Rev James Nichols, formerly rector of Llandovery, and who is supposed by some authorities to have designed the present church building. Soon afterwards was built by Robert Carre the second church, in Market Street, a few yards south of the former building, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary on the 22nd of June 1604, and was afterwards occupied by the Methodists. The Revs James and John Piggott, formerly priests of St Peter\u2019s Vicarage, received their appointments on the 28th of December 1606 and the Rev Charles Eversley on the 15th of June 1608 respectively, and they continued at the South Wales college at Aberystwyth. In 1615 the chapel belonging to the college was moved on the west side of the church in Market Street, and in 1628 another chapel was built at the east end of the cloisters at the foundation of the present building. In those days the schools and academies were opened in connection with the schools ; the schools, however, being later separated from the academy, and all the schools established as separate institutions. The first school in St Asaph, that I can find, was the grammar school of the parish Church of St Mary\u2019s, which, when erected about the time of Richard III, was kept by the parishioners, as also other parochial schools. The first public elementary school established in the town of St Asaph may be thus described : On the 1st of August 1632 a charter for four scholars of the school of reading and declining letters at St. Mary\u2019s church in the town of St Asaph, was granted by the Hon Robert Pole, father of Richard Pole who became Marquess of Bath. This charter was to be renewed every 3 years, except when for some cause it should be necessary to renew it more often ; wherefore the charter was perpetual, till in the year 1699 it was purchased and changed by John Wellesley, third Earl of Bath for 300 pounds sterling, which sum was paid to the school chaplain William Wise at the close of the present year. The school was to contain five scholars and an assistant, who were to be students and scholars of the grammar school of the parish Church of St Mary\u2019s ; whereas the scholars whose names have been already mentioned were to be allowed free schools and free grammar course books. Mr William Crashaw Wyles was chosen as master of these school, and other arrangements were made with respect to books and board.","token_len":640,"entropy":[10.84,5.1468,11.1798,0.1313,3.569,3.5624,2.1509,3.7305,5.6423,2.6052,4.5866,5.0989,1.7981,11.1002,0.0039,3.8671,6.9707,1.5288,4.1664,5.4341,5.8138,1.4784,1.7548,1.4898,3.5848,0.0121,0.4478,10.8296,8.0473,3.6836,0.6942,0.5292,0.3839,0.1592,7.1158,5.8722,4.0887,1.0257,3.5531,0.0144,7.5295,3.0725,7.4076,1.6412,5.1352,0.0205,1.1392,7.2564,6.1432,8.7239,14.8678,8.3051,4.1146,3.2941,1.6747,8.1148,2.6403,0.8584,4.1233,0.971,5.8768,1.5005,1.4068,3.0422,0.0716,0.6132,3.8979,0.7647,1.0662,4.5871,7.8227,0.2427,2.8713,3.1836,6.6992,5.6341,1.5306,1.6668,5.7974,7.9033,1.3578,1.9903,5.4671,9.4031,1.9254,3.9344,5.3451,0.2311,2.6226,5.7707,1.3267,4.0883,1.6284,0.1046,2.0188,7.8013,8.8866,1.1648,3.4753,1.1444,4.0322,4.2803,2.91,6.0537,0.0342,1.8531,2.2103,1.6455,5.7298,0.0744,3.2038,1.5149,6.4722,0.6317,1.488,0.2767,0.0121,2.0832,4.8356,1.4359,2.8828,0.7124,1.6445,3.6279,3.1556,1.9844,6.1877,2.2236,1.4742,3.3862,7.2353,8.7039,1.0368,5.0652,8.0168,0.0079,0.2578,7.1167,5.2052,3.7233,1.9187,1.7573,4.4027,3.1529,6.5259,2.7495,1.369,6.4673,0.1533,0.1557,8.1718,0.9693,4.9047,0.5024,6.8328,0.6227,6.6406,1.453,6.8189,2.2293,4.2338,3.422,0.7008,0.0096,2.6046,4.4667,2.1006,1.848,3.0534,9.7213,0.7288,0.5123,3.6796,3.9149,2.7428,2.2091,0.2214,0.5504,3.7621,5.0956,0.9496,2.077,1.1073,4.9278,1.9241,1.1368,6.4511,0.1412,2.4889,1.78,4.2574,0.845,0.324,2.7208,0.3374,2.1763,1.5152,0.8865,2.1178,4.0406,4.287,0.2301,1.0532,10.0933,0.0451,1.3069,1.5131,3.8883,3.9828,6.0105,3.0217,2.2122,5.604,6.1466,0.3148,1.0954,3.7571,4.8177,1.0565,1.8057,5.1321,6.5495,0.2708,0.0937,6.8061,0.0448,2.0879,0.5468,5.4852,2.1391,5.6955,3.0885,0.7659,3.6309,0.0146,0.1053,2.7215,0.4699,2.9324,2.5748,3.5291,1.6835,5.9631,5.0361,4.9267,3.3106,5.3069,0.0792,3.5099,0.0108,0.2259,3.3433,0.4021,2.3892,3.7853,1.561,1.3282,4.0403,3.6252,4.4903,1.2262,7.7397,6.2385,6.177,4.2933,6.0011,1.1006,0.0025,0.0001,0.0004,2.1747,2.2321,0.9903,3.7745,1.5935,5.7825,7.0637,0.0172,0.9311,5.5209,0.3768,4.5662,4.9019,2.2817,3.8762,1.0955,0.2273,0.9967,2.7506,4.0825,5.037,0.2465,0.9909,1.4824,1.8236,0.449,4.9117,5.3782,1.7428,0.6301,1.2167,2.0122,1.6577,4.5869,1.0023,0.2158,0.3653,8.3833,1.9587,3.497,1.932,7.7337,0.2802,0.4782,4.3081,3.3747,0.5496,1.7406,6.2902,0.8468,1.0646,6.7442,3.0821,4.6068,0.0,1.3334,5.2904,2.1461,6.8427,0.0108,0.606,4.4394,7.8553,2.1597,4.0958,2.7201,1.8665,0.0165,2.0818,7.3895,5.8132,1.0297,0.5952,3.7256,1.0264,2.1633,4.5049,1.077,3.1007,6.0447,3.1149,3.756,2.347,1.4626,1.3859,3.0352,1.8979,2.3516,3.9444,9.2219,2.1032,1.6248,5.6088,7.1952,3.975,3.1309,0.9436,0.5724,3.6793,6.2397,0.1004,1.8064,1.2007,3.5684,6.3587,0.5696,1.7461,2.4574,3.4966,0.0135,0.0329,2.3532,2.204,2.96,3.645,3.2412,5.7595,2.7581,3.5031,0.4358,6.5946,2.5593,2.186,0.8636,6.2253,3.0727,0.9301,4.0204,2.928,0.0083,2.0626,3.2208,5.6164,5.6509,5.5221,1.9346,0.0077,0.5138,1.698,1.3388,2.3566,4.9441,4.6681,0.245,5.5395,0.9103,1.1992,2.0844,1.8496,2.1265,2.165,0.0027,7.571,0.3318,8.4306,1.3137,1.9567,5.1722,0.5568,3.4089,0.0371,0.3587,2.4078,0.2844,5.0167,2.4998,3.1944,2.9566,6.5809,9.4011,2.0328,1.4252,3.758,2.8546,8.2401,2.4684,11.1034,7.3765,4.9605,1.5916,4.551,1.654,3.2296,0.0067,0.0265,4.3153,3.3396,1.704,1.7633,0.516,1.9751,1.3212,0.0012,1.3379,2.0124,2.3782,1.2754,0.8998,7.4559,8.0423,10.6885,1.2931,6.2359,0.1162,3.6197,5.9608,6.3985,4.382,7.3069,1.1571,0.2452,5.8032,1.5322,2.5479,0.8315,0.8655,4.3463,0.4135,3.0251,3.1144,5.6939,0.7348,1.1853,4.9095,2.406,7.2364,3.0101,5.2929,1.8757,3.039,0.7723,3.5971,0.475,3.1938,1.6228,4.8026,1.7642,3.0493,5.9938,1.6162,1.6706,1.9353,0.52,8.5661,1.7222,4.3861,4.0702,1.8707,1.5578,0.5105,7.3206,1.5431,0.3539,6.2374,2.5979,5.5211,1.8896,3.9782,8.7373,1.9812,0.6819,7.9443,2.8446,0.0747,3.0531,5.0375,7.718,1.0183,1.7136,1.2678,2.5387,4.3237,1.6595,2.7566,1.784,0.8436,3.1832,7.8129,0.0253,4.2514,8.5503,3.9902,1.1001,3.3268,0.0091,0.6663,3.8343,1.0319,0.5041,1.4307,1.8237,1.2621,2.8641,6.7221,4.2719,4.2949,2.4424,4.2836,3.3532,2.186,2.4443,1.512,0.6365,0.9896,5.8514,3.1912,5.1567,1.7273,0.9633,4.4219,0.6261,2.455,0.9081,0.7185,1.5905,0.4464,0.1894,0.4662,1.6125,0.0035,0.004,4.1466,7.3081,0.8716,7.625,7.6424,3.8636,3.0751,0.4805,5.6744,0.8154,1.4587,0.697,0.4449,5.9098,4.9169,6.9573,2.7954,3.0103,5.7947,7.6639,4.9361,1.2668,5.2948,4.909,13.8013,9.7394,12.2011,4.7692,2.3205,4.4724,1.5998,5.6742,0.5353,4.9796,3.9999,1.3318,0.5466,6.9874,7.63,0.5318,0.1891,1.935,3.4753,0.0521,6.6899,1.4232,9.2647,2.2347]}

This use was rejected by military authorities","text":"Prior to 1895 two 6 @ - @ inch ( 200 mm ) breech @ - @ loading guns had been imported for use in small boats. This use was rejected by military authorities on economic grounds at the time. The Naval gun manufacturers, however, carried on with it ( see Note 5 ) but were soon forced to stop on account of the small calibre not being considered suitable for larger guns or in naval service.\nIn 1892 the Government asked the Naval gun manufacturers if'they had any plans to carry out work of the above description.\nThey decided they did not have a strong hold on the subject of rifled breech loading for ships and therefore did not offer any details at the time, leaving the question open.\nIn March 1895 the Director of Naval Ordnance decided to investigate the possibility of using rifle grenades for breechloading guns at the rate of one per year in support of submarine work.\nThe contractor, Mr. N. R. W. E. Kilshaw, was authorised to investigate the question in details.\nHe found that the rifled breech loading guns could be used successfully on the Royal Navy for submerged defence with no serious disadvantages other than increased weight and cost.\nAs the Navy had been carrying on work on rifled breechloading breech-loading guns for six years with no obvious difficulties to be overcome it became desirable to carry on the work further.\nIn 1894 the Naval Ordnance Division had obtained a contract to carry out studies to determine whether the use of rifle grenades for breech loading guns would be feasible.\nThe contracts given for carrying out such studies were to be awarded as a whole and there was some difficulty in selecting the appropriate authorised contractor on account of the necessity to select a company with a reputation for carrying on similar work which was known to have been successful in obtaining contracts for studies of this type.\nKilshaw had a long-standing reputation for carrying out such studies and the Navy felt that if he was successful in one he would be successful in similar ones.\nThe Naval Ordnance Division accordingly concluded that Kilshaw would be the most suitable contractor to carry out the above work.\nAs a preliminary requirement to the work it was necessary to choose a suitable gun and to prepare and design the rifled breech loading breech-loading gun with an associated ammunition.\nThe two types available to the Navy were of 60 and 68-inch ( 1470 and 1600 mm ) calibre.\nThe naval gun makers, however, felt that these were larger calibres for which they did not possess the capacity to manufacture the ammunition and the Naval Ordnance Division therefore decided to select a more suitable calibre for the work.\nThe Naval Ordnance Division, after consulting with the Naval gun makers, also decided to have a short ( 6 @ - @ inch ) breech-loading gun.\nThis decision was also made on the basis of ease in fabrication and reliability of the work when carried out by the Naval Ordnance Division.\nThe Admiralty agreed to fund the work and on 7 January 1895 the contractors were told that they were required to submit a provisional report by 30 June.1895.\n\n","token_len":640,"entropy":[2.7671,11.6632,8.9776,9.2217,12.501,6.9843,5.1206,10.6031,3.8164,10.5861,2.4896,0.9162,10.7622,0.3322,6.566,2.3378,2.2604,10.4191,7.5065,4.1327,2.0435,5.846,3.4538,1.9675,0.8299,5.3118,3.58,1.1056,3.1936,5.9691,1.0339,6.8863,1.1721,6.8849,1.702,4.5809,9.3447,0.0477,6.1349,0.5778,0.8076,0.6807,1.9927,6.6122,6.3771,5.6502,2.8798,1.6277,0.0264,6.6562,2.554,1.5828,5.1948,5.2277,6.6312,5.7748,3.7804,3.0845,4.5985,2.5593,3.7883,1.79,0.1659,3.0586,6.5141,3.3418,0.0203,1.3719,5.3506,3.6873,0.1561,8.0157,0.4803,5.1802,2.147,0.1451,5.1598,3.2189,4.4657,3.9871,4.9936,2.2425,0.3691,2.2482,5.0102,2.6855,3.1614,1.2731,6.0993,5.9793,1.0214,3.5848,1.3442,0.646,4.098,15.7349,7.5184,2.2509,2.2714,2.5261,0.7094,4.3284,1.4736,6.2374,4.0498,2.7868,5.8986,4.1985,1.1454,3.4687,4.6166,4.3924,4.2461,3.1177,0.19,2.362,2.6109,5.3388,7.1659,0.4928,0.7912,5.1197,3.6631,8.3066,1.8797,1.9249,0.1835,4.1695,4.4605,5.3396,2.4044,3.76,3.2473,0.0411,4.7188,1.7969,6.5849,3.7976,0.695,0.0436,3.3709,6.1992,1.1571,1.5973,2.2061,1.9118,1.368,2.0338,4.5903,1.831,0.963,7.204,0.2656,1.2379,3.8467,0.0209,3.5327,0.9382,4.8198,0.8629,3.6387,0.2426,2.4212,7.0712,7.4042,1.5443,2.8137,0.0694,2.4799,3.5621,4.1043,1.7067,5.9708,0.2537,2.4727,2.6361,4.738,3.8306,7.8994,0.011,6.6324,4.5961,0.5539,1.2117,1.5872,8.433,2.5815,5.6283,0.9682,5.116,0.6423,3.6883,0.1515,3.8265,0.2941,5.4172,1.1642,7.5204,7.9417,0.3861,1.9404,7.2822,0.5572,6.9487,1.1788,2.9686,2.87,9.1549,1.9488,1.2789,2.4501,2.0034,0.7112,1.2038,6.2622,0.2849,1.1336,0.0053,0.8556,4.7669,3.1526,0.9537,1.3167,5.6662,3.1691,2.996,6.0674,0.1806,3.8822,9.109,5.2761,5.6078,2.8804,3.9134,4.9514,5.6836,0.01,5.3019,4.3362,1.0326,5.0993,0.3649,0.682,4.5431,2.221,4.3545,2.5328,2.6049,4.1707,3.2497,2.2105,1.1531,3.1306,0.0152,0.6643,0.0062,1.5158,3.2307,0.0807,4.5098,0.0511,0.6494,1.2601,5.137,0.4597,4.4197,1.3421,5.0535,4.1602,3.8199,2.3915,2.5323,3.2851,3.3531,5.4422,0.4357,3.8279,1.5362,1.7205,0.8326,6.2832,1.065,0.5656,1.7605,3.6629,0.8076,1.2268,3.0025,2.8174,0.0017,4.4027,4.077,5.5071,1.813,2.4193,1.3144,0.7419,0.7252,6.5149,3.5345,1.8853,1.8545,1.5563,2.8988,0.0256,1.936,0.1977,1.3061,0.4167,0.0047,1.2043,0.6604,1.9472,0.8017,2.2064,0.8001,0.4856,1.272,6.9731,6.857,3.9167,6.1524,0.1367,3.1669,0.8604,0.6787,3.3508,0.4701,2.9521,3.9969,2.9799,3.4919,2.526,5.0427,0.8081,3.7881,4.1237,0.6067,5.1916,1.3854,3.8594,10.5269,2.7061,5.7228,4.0442,0.0105,0.4949,7.1819,2.0675,6.0344,1.2483,4.0889,2.449,1.5325,5.0136,0.411,4.5105,3.7725,5.4096,0.4038,5.9174,1.7949,5.4531,0.4043,3.0766,1.3639,4.2504,1.3301,5.6476,2.1365,0.9643,9.1775,2.067,2.8615,1.9185,0.407,0.2785,6.263,0.0673,0.0114,3.1827,2.8523,4.4513,2.8675,0.2864,3.315,0.7534,2.1083,0.2189,3.2575,0.7683,1.3678,3.0692,3.7372,5.3279,1.1664,4.0039,1.5029,2.3947,3.0383,0.9284,7.9062,2.4762,0.8744,0.9496,5.0771,0.1209,6.8988,3.4654,0.6727,0.4954,1.5289,2.7118,0.2061,0.0001,0.4343,8.0893,4.9226,0.1952,13.5937,0.0137,2.4821,0.7123,2.7623,3.1484,0.9198,2.1587,1.6552,0.0761,0.1673,1.3371,6.475,2.355,0.6157,0.2613,4.1203,2.1513,6.4329,7.0843,3.0725,1.6334,1.6745,3.1373,0.3306,4.0902,0.3706,6.2952,0.7509,2.5628,4.8837,3.2382,2.4913,5.2352,4.8002,5.9173,1.7499,3.8706,0.0112,0.6258,0.0007,0.4302,2.9363,0.0026,0.7529,0.0787,1.0682,3.471,3.0837,6.5039,3.6205,1.4054,0.3607,1.1021,6.0233,4.2608,6.5574,1.93,0.6875,1.0624,0.7228,6.2122,9.0807,4.2513,6.2466,5.2185,1.4094,1.8257,7.2867,5.8144,5.1762,4.9067,0.141,1.2381,2.2241,0.2699,1.4341,0.548,0.8731,4.9888,1.0681,2.7115,3.0263,0.8342,0.0179,4.7581,0.1767,3.4001,2.3406,7.9444,0.6337,0.5853,4.0334,4.0367,1.3485,3.3583,0.0095,4.8929,0.9455,3.7349,0.4211,3.2494,2.1906,2.3594,2.1079,3.8671,6.2339,0.6546,0.0001,0.4364,2.9664,1.1935,0.4404,4.9282,0.9033,4.6746,0.1655,3.839,0.0027,1.3068,0.9465,0.5599,0.2799,0.1902,1.0659,4.0209,0.2893,0.0001,0.1894,3.0289,3.907,2.1435,0.7823,0.598,2.3615,2.1764,1.819,0.6212,5.2098,1.2557,0.5554,4.6171,1.4004,5.8856,6.2815,4.2833,5.7564,0.567,2.581,0.9426,0.7705,2.2448,0.0008,1.3873,0.1265,0.6645,3.0137,0.3982,2.1533,6.9528,0.5331,4.8934,1.8005,2.9755,0.741,0.5973,0.5101,12.9752,3.1229,6.4199,0.9551,4.7839,0.9583,0.2303,4.9045,6.2532,3.4639,0.0316,2.5718,1.0731,2.9875,1.1698,0.0001,0.2198,0.4646,0.2135,1.0981,7.9733,0.005,4.8086,0.9203,5.6064,0.633,1.1986,2.2989,4.5791,4.2067,2.9911,0.7001,0.7648,7.6934,1.5794,5.046,0.8761,1.352,2.2356,2.816,0.039,3.3981,1.3046,7.1691,0.9413,4.2859,3.534,2.649,2.6459,10.3987,0.9739,1.1558,6.7223]}

Crittenden had expressed his desire","text":"President Lincoln called a special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special elections in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to go to Washington and stand up for the Union, but his wife and family were deeply worried. As the summer approached, people began to realize that Lincoln was not serious about issuing peace. They began expressing their fear of an armed insurrection. The threat of armed insurrection increased as the month of July came, and on July 4, 1861, a crowd of hundreds of citizens gathered at the capitol in Lexington, Kentucky on what became known as the Fourth of July Rebellion.\nOn July 5, 1861, at the start of the day's session at the capitol in Lexington, the Kentucky general assembly convened. The Governor opened the session with a speech of encouragement and assurance, but there was little cooperation from one of the two legislature's new members, John Crittenden, a friend of secession. Crittenden stated that he would not join the other Kentucky representatives in calling for action against the Union. As a result, the session adjourned and when the session resumed on July 10 the general secretary, Patrick McPherson, informed the president that \"the Kentucky Representatives have refused to take the official action of this state within the rules of the Congressional law.\" Crittenden had been the main supporter of Lincoln's cause in Kentucky, and this defeat was critical to his position, and he resigned his seat on the House of Representatives on the same day. Crittenden did not, however, resign as governor. As the president signed the Emancipation Proclamation June 30, the following day, his secretary of state advised that Crittenden was to be in the White House on the evening of the same day, July 4, signing the proclamation. The president had requested that his cabinet appoint some attorneys to fill vacant cabinet offices ; after hearing the report that Crittenden had taken the oath of office as governor, Lincoln appointed two others, John Sherman, and Daniel Webster, to serve as attorney general.\nIn reaction, Congress on July 10 refused to admit Crittenden's appointees and sent them to the White House and requested the president to send them back to office so that they could read their letters of office. Crittenden immediately demanded satisfaction for the office theft, and Lincoln responded that the White House would appoint some counselors in the executive branch, but if the office was filled again by Crittenden before they returned, they should be sent home. Soon after, the president went to Nashville, Tennessee to attend the National Convention, which was scheduled for July 24 through the 27th. Lincoln left Washington on July 6, 1861, via Philadelphia. On the way to Nashville, he stopped at Louisville and stopped with Crittenden on his way to Kentucky to attend the Convention, which he had been invited to attend. The president stayed with Crittenden briefly in Kentucky, and then went to Nashville for his participation.

Arnold and Davenport left the band, and Bloomfield went on to form his own group, Electric Flag. The Butterfield Blues Band, on the other hand, went on to enjoy an international hit with the song, \" Whipping Post. \" The Butterfield Blues Band was a group that went on to sell tens of thousands of records, as well as creating other hit songs. The group also had some international hits, such as \"Lonely Planet \" and \" Whipping Post. \" The band also performed in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and Canada. Arnold and Davenport both left the band in the early '80s, and in 1981 the group did not perform another concert. According to Bloomfield, the reason he and his band left the band was because they were not getting the results that they thought they were. When they signed with the CBS label, Bloomfield thought they were working on a hit country rock song, but that the label wanted them to rewrite that song so it would be commercial country music rather than rock. Bloomfield said that they wrote only three songs for that album, and that one of them was written by John McGrath. The Butterfield Blues Band released an album in 1982, which was much like their earlier album, The Butterfield Blues Band ( 1978 ). It was called, The Best Thing We Ever Danced. The band was very successful with that album, and they kept performing in clubs all over the country. In the '80s, the Butterfield Blues Band went on to perform in concerts, and in 1988 they played at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. This was the first time that the band performed in the state of California, and it was a huge success. The Butterfield Blues Band has played concerts through the 1990s. However, it is not known what the lineup will be for the Butterfield Blues Band in the 21st century. The Butterfield Blues Band has been a big hit in the United States, and many people have a very positive opinion of the band and their album covers. The band performed in the '70s and 1980s, and people say that the band has been the best R&B group in the United States since the late '50s and early '60s.

{"prompt":"Construction of the second section started in 2007 and was completed in 2011 . The section between Sandvika and Lysaker is 6 @ . @ 7 kilometres ( 4 @ . @ 2 mi )","text":"Construction of the second section started in 2007 and was completed in 2011. The section between Sandvika and Lysaker is 6 @. @ 7 kilometres ( 4 @. @ 2 mi ) long. The line also has a bypass railway, to bypass the busy roads in the immediate surroundings of the tracks.\nThe Lysaker to Vard\u00f8 section, completed in 2013, has about the same length as the initial section. The section is also about half the width.\n\nTechnical construction\n\nThe total length of the T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Sandvika railway (before the widening in 2003) is 12\u00a0mi.\nThe track is laid entirely on subway-levels except of a narrow-gauge section in the municipality of T\u00f8nsberg: from Sandvika to Lysaker. From Lysaker to Kjeller, there is a narrow-gauge part consisting of two switches over a narrow-gauge road and the main line. The track continues along the river Lene, across the bridge, then along a level track. The main line ends at Vard\u00f8 railway station.\nThe tracks are electrified up to 25 kV.\nThe section between Sandvika and Lysaker is double-tracked with two parallel rails 3\u00a0ft\u00a06\u00a0\u00b3\u2044\u2088\u00a0in (1,067\u00a0mm, 0\u00a0in) apart.\nAt Kjeller, the rails were switched to the narrow-gauge part, which is double-tracked with two parallel rails 2\u00a0ft 6 \u2075 \u2075 \u2079\u00a0in (762\u00a0mm, 0\u00a0in) apart, the trains running from the north and south sides of a small viaduct. When the narrow-gauge section was built in the 1920s, a temporary trestle was put in place on the existing bridges, the tracks extending at right-angles up the bridges and down the slopes onto the level track on Lysaker.\nThe current track, from Sandvika near the T\u00f8nsberg\u2013Sandvika railway bridge (which is a part of the N\u00e6r\u00f8yvaerda bridge system), up to the bypass line, is double-tracked with two parallel rails 3\u00a0ft\u00a06\u00a0\u00b3\u2044\u2088\u00a0in (1,067\u00a0mm, 0\u00a0in) apart. Afterwards the track switches to a narrow gauge for about 500 m, before extending to a parallel track. From there the track continues on the existing level track up to Vard\u00f8 railway station, where the tracks are split again and the train continues the long section from Vard\u00f8 to Kjeller on a

Initial shooting occurred for","text":"The film's principal photography was expected to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for six days, mostly in Rajasthan, followed by a five-day shoot in Pune, Maharashtra. This began the cast and crew's stay in Pune until the film was completed. However, due to scheduling challenges, the film was released post production. Principal photography for the film was completed on 16 March 2008 in Rajasthan and on 30 April 2009 it was filmed almost entirely in Mumbai.\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by A.R. Rahman. Rahman had composed the original soundtrack for the 2006 video game The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, and later created the soundtrack for the movie The Lunchbox which won the Golden Globe award for Best Original Score. Rahman performed at the premiere party for the film on 28 February 2008. Rahman and Bollywood singer Javed Sheikh performed the music to the song \"Soonyar\" during the launch event of the film at the Ritz-Carlton in Mumbai. \"Soonyar\" was chosen as the soundtrack for the film's trailer.\nThe film marks the directorial debut of Pankaj Kapur, who was previously known for his work with his father, writer-director Ram Gopal Varma, and his cousin, Remo D'Souza, who both directed films.\n\nRelease\n\nThe film was scheduled to be released on 18 June 2009, but was postponed due to financial issues during production. A release date of 16 June was finally announced on 25 January 2009. However, the film was released on 9 June 2009, with its North American premiere in May 29, 2009. The South Indian version was released on 16 June 2009, both in 2160p high definition and Blu-ray in India. The UK was the first foreign country to receive the film in full high definition.\n\nReception\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews. At Filmibeat, the reviewer gave the film a four-star rating, writing \"The movie is loaded with good humour, warm heart and, especially, a lot of energy.\" In another review, a critic from Deccan Chronicle noted that the film \"provides audiences with one of the best films that they would ever see on screen this year. The only weak part is that the film is not as captivating as it could be.\" \nA critic from The Indian Express wrote that the film was \"meant to be a lighter entertainment, but is too deep in some parts for the majority of the viewers to enjoy. The plot line follows a woman and her two small children,\" and added \"With enough time to breathe, it may make audiences think about some important subjects like gender balance and equality of genders.\" \nCritics found the film to be funny and thought the characters were \"well developed\". They noted that the cast were \"very entertaining on screen\" and the songs \"help to break the monotony of the storyline.\" One critic found the film \"a pleasure to watch\" and that the cast \"are perfect for the role\".","token_len":642,"entropy":[8.1984,2.2316,5.7708,3.3852,2.1392,9.4123,0.0645,1.8031,2.1631,7.4444,2.5461,6.4813,1.2552,1.72,3.6583,3.0408,3.704,0.7233,0.2557,1.1957,2.609,7.0336,4.1989,3.6109,3.2701,0.7049,0.2258,4.964,8.928,0.9109,0.0006,0.7998,8.5368,4.939,5.7383,5.6601,4.0186,0.9088,2.1568,6.4803,0.8397,2.8157,0.0673,0.0002,1.1738,3.9098,0.084,2.2896,4.5735,0.2761,0.0599,1.6535,0.3943,4.5779,0.3533,1.095,3.7406,0.9363,4.1457,5.4403,3.5646,6.7509,2.4244,0.4243,1.5559,5.7875,0.3305,2.7996,0.0009,5.5468,1.809,3.6787,1.0123,2.567,1.4959,5.4084,0.0328,3.3387,0.0027,3.968,4.6465,0.4215,1.1854,1.6798,0.6314,4.4188,8.412,4.8736,3.0917,9.5083,0.0496,2.6304,0.5659,0.3187,1.0672,2.8671,1.0452,2.9731,1.0269,0.2905,2.383,1.8278,0.0036,0.0006,2.0592,1.8041,4.0454,1.2194,4.4638,7.0551,0.2059,3.97,8.6083,1.1816,0.202,2.7014,0.3967,1.5579,6.3476,1.3807,1.4181,4.5485,0.6313,1.3677,0.2395,5.0826,1.6555,3.1588,0.0962,6.3181,2.2314,4.991,2.9667,3.0986,1.0533,3.4747,1.8013,0.3439,0.7694,7.5224,6.0483,1.1123,2.9501,1.1229,0.0168,0.0422,0.6161,6.2397,0.0045,1.1019,1.3295,3.861,4.5682,0.686,1.1501,0.1168,0.5439,3.7679,1.8739,11.6657,0.3831,5.3261,4.0834,0.562,4.0349,0.5553,3.8613,0.689,0.3167,2.9562,0.7394,1.0935,2.8594,5.0878,3.6886,0.7635,5.1716,6.7343,0.7954,0.5551,0.4833,1.966,3.4409,2.3367,1.0504,0.8027,3.2384,3.194,5.8676,2.122,3.3722,4.7106,3.6413,6.8029,1.3804,1.7414,3.6733,4.3607,0.567,4.6492,0.7194,6.3285,9.24,10.432,1.3325,2.5849,0.3806,6.3942,3.667,1.5702,0.2865,0.4693,2.5608,0.7032,4.3277,2.1771,2.3058,0.0003,0.0,1.4941,2.7399,0.8227,5.2772,0.6186,0.0105,0.007,0.1004,0.8789,4.8492,0.8432,0.3128,2.6886,0.5156,0.1646,0.3028,2.6222,4.8951,1.205,1.2337,1.1218,1.0133,7.4008,0.3206,5.7273,1.9503,0.0259,0.2738,5.0888,2.7776,0.0322,3.7971,2.8267,0.8946,1.0352,2.2327,3.3107,2.5595,0.9715,0.8593,1.8852,1.4021,5.3414,3.4414,1.2823,6.9283,2.8664,0.1714,3.4632,4.0899,0.0558,5.5273,0.9594,1.5199,0.8417,3.0865,5.5952,0.8029,8.8364,4.3191,4.2114,4.418,1.9621,0.0348,0.0002,1.6563,1.8259,4.9715,1.7626,4.1249,2.1019,1.9336,6.4502,5.6689,2.3416,0.0013,0.7615,0.3843,1.0066,5.3243,0.5477,0.9801,0.1408,0.7309,4.1307,3.5917,1.8195,1.3131,1.0051,1.2707,1.8086,1.0888,0.0028,3.2847,1.6625,5.2993,2.0614,0.3557,4.0292,3.4847,0.2085,2.0847,3.6222,1.0575,2.7514,6.0386,1.7192,1.0079,3.2446,3.5094,2.5276,0.6771,3.7372,0.0285,1.4344,0.7826,0.6925,3.2625,1.0465,4.7303,2.1296,0.7106,1.1693,2.6571,3.6862,6.765,0.1844,2.5443,2.8028,5.2221,10.1443,0.4465,0.5781,0.3346,1.2942,6.6031,3.3495,3.6791,1.1334,0.555,0.2539,3.1948,0.945,0.5924,1.0426,7.6619,1.0523,6.6296,7.9277,0.3795,5.2091,1.694,1.1202,6.373,0.0312,0.0994,3.8959,4.3335,0.4234,1.2276,5.6112,4.4724,2.3958,1.0328,5.8448,2.152,0.0943,3.2339,0.5273,0.5098,1.8863,4.0966,6.4504,0.1634,1.0162,0.9878,0.0002,4.8926,0.0197,0.0921,0.0002,0.9897,0.5579,0.8299,2.8319,9.7059,0.8442,0.1217,1.3153,5.884,7.222,10.6357,8.356,1.4526,1.5881,4.0033,5.1863,0.6665,0.4473,0.843,5.8756,2.0732,0.3296,0.4155,1.3269,5.5868,2.42,2.0664,2.7728,0.8315,8.5561,0.0648,4.0104,3.7725,0.8881,7.868,3.2717,1.7589,5.7385,5.0461,0.3111,1.7446,3.1319,0.0437,5.9063,2.2077,3.4094,5.6045,0.6903,0.171,3.2759,0.7563,4.7224,7.1256,2.0349,0.0307,2.7091,4.2884,0.9399,0.8891,0.598,1.7692,5.3761,0.0349,7.7355,0.2274,5.3359,0.4358,0.3108,2.0858,3.7987,3.8704,3.1307,5.6927,0.6905,0.2734,2.8038,3.4737,8.3781,1.2696,1.7926,1.618,5.2437,6.8582,3.8371,1.1537,1.1526,1.3515,2.4457,1.188,2.8255,2.5258,6.7272,0.0005,0.3637,1.1486,1.8719,0.5188,1.1807,10.1187,3.3573,14.0624,3.4087,0.8077,2.1786,3.565,0.0757,2.3142,0.9665,0.7595,0.3469,1.7781,0.414,7.4465,0.2551,0.4287,0.38,0.88,8.0893,7.3091,2.1285,1.4449,3.4839,3.9819,6.6971,2.2419,6.3448,2.1907,2.1809,1.8697,5.1274,0.0902,1.1933,3.3957,1.3988,1.7818,2.2068,1.3369,3.505,6.737,6.916,0.974,4.4432,3.156,0.2744,3.0444,5.5568,0.3133,7.2409,1.6083,2.0942,2.0805,5.7995,5.6661,2.6236,2.5919,6.2447,0.7107,2.1607,4.2302,4.3088,7.7487,2.6655,2.6123,5.2009,4.5455,4.1154,2.116,4.775,5.1156,1.2763,5.5898,2.3756,5.169,1.2807,2.165,0.208,12.8659,5.5681,0.2968,0.2824,1.1367,0.0495,5.4361,0.9574,3.8077,1.297,3.0428,0.792,2.0061,3.8679,3.3714,2.3154,3.8577,3.0082,0.281,0.6483,4.0605,4.4513,1.2717,2.7332,5.1524,5.9607,2.2538,2.5486,0.2228,2.5028,6.4607,1.8745,6.4844,1.8478,5.2152,0.9028,3.4489,0.0424,0.0104,0.9891,0.6391,5.6168,1.0533,4.9945,1.1186,5.0811,0.3559,0.6751,0.9003,2.1196,6.2287,0.1153,0.2062,3.0752,0.2933,4.0902,0.9675,2.5704,1.3237,3.0044,7.0821,0.8485,1.7281,2.4375,3.3614]}

{"prompt":"Both sexes become sexually mature at 10 to 14 months . A seasonal breeder , the time when mating occurs varies geographically . Mating may peak in the rainy season ( August to September )","text":"Both sexes become sexually mature at 10 to 14 months. A seasonal breeder, the time when mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season ( August to September ) or in the dry season ( November to February ).\nThe nest is a tube that has a single entrance on the top and a single exit near the bottom. The entrance is usually a slit formed in the bark of a tree. The length of nest varies between 1 to 3 m and its width between 10 to 20 mm. In Ecuador, where the bird occurs all year round, the entrance is located in the bark of a tree close to the ground. Near the ground in a tree, on the other hand, the entrance to nest is usually a forked crack. The nest is lined with green grass. An observation of an individual in handing revealed that it feeds its young with a plant ( unknown ) that has a greenish appearance.\nOne of the eggs is larger and white in color while the other two eggs are white and slightly reddish in color. There were also reports that the young sings in a range of 7 to 45 kHz which is similar to that of a Green Heron.\nThe adult is about 1 m long and weighs about 45 grams. Most adult birds are grey in colour with a red ring on the upper part of the head.\nFeeding habits\nLike most birds, it feeds mainly on aquatic and terrestrial insects and invertebrates as well as on small reptiles and small fish while the adults prefer fish and aquatic insects while the younger birds feed mainly on eggs. It forages in the water either at night or on short trips and flies slowly above the water. Like most fishers, it can also dive to a depth of 40 meters.\nDistribution\nIts distribution in the world is tropical and subtropical and ranges throughout Southeast Asia to China and Russia, Central America, Venezuela, and Mexico. In Ecuador it is common in tropical lowland forests in the Choc\u00f3 region of the country. Its range extends around the Guayas, Pastaza, and Napo provinces. It ranges from the Ecuadorian Amazon from southern Colombia and Venezuela, from northern Peru ( southern ) to Ecuador. In the Ecuadorian Amazon it has been recorded and observed along the Napo and Amazon rivers. It has also been observed on the R\u00edo Santiago in the western part of the country. It was recorded in the province of Santa Elena along the Choco coast and in Manab\u00ed province on the Pacific coast, from northern Colombia to northern Bolivia, and has been recorded all the way up to the Napo River where it was first seen in 1935.

{"prompt":"Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Andrew was seconded to the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force .

In early 1940, he was appointed commander of 22nd Battalion, then forming at Wairau Valley, New Zealand (now the 21st Battalion, NZDF ) and stationed at Rangiora Barracks, New Zealand.\nOn 24 August 1943, he was killed in action in the New Guinea jungle following a small-scale assault in which 32 soldiers from his battalion were killed.\nAndrew Leighton was succeeded as commanding officer of the 21st Battalion by Rear Admiral J.W.B.G. Pye and the following year he was made a Companion of Order of St. Michael and St. George.\nI found the whole place to be a very cheerful resort, there are a number of buildings here, the principal one being used as a barracks for the 21st Battalion, New Zealand army. The people of the locality are most polite and helpful, and the few things that were needed were promptly got, and this greatly pleased me.\" On the return of the Army to England, the village was named New Zeeland in honour of the New Zealanders who had been killed during the war.\nThe village of New Zeeland was renamed New Zealand on 12 November 1950 as a result of New Zealand's admission to the Commonwealth of Nations.\nA commemorative stone, commissioned by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and erected by the Government Grant Board, is placed at this spot ; it is marked with the names of all those who fell in the New Zealand war efforts.\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn October 1940, Brigadier-General Hugh Campbell, the Commanding Officer of No. 1 Infantry Brigade, visited and inspected New Zealand and suggested that the camp should be converted into a suitable barrack for the Royal Australian Field Force ( RAF ). The work began on the New Zealand Barracks and by 1944 over 3,000 soldiers were in residence.\nThe RAF occupation of New Zealand was short-lived ; on 2 June 1943 it was transferred to the New Zealand Army and in 1945 it was once again handed back to the RAF. In July 1953, the airfield was closed to take over personnel from the Australian Garrison.\nOutside the site are a number of buildings, some of which were used by the New Zealand Army and others by the Royal Australian Air Force. The barracks are currently in use by the British Army and the Australian Army.\nA concrete airstrip, now closed to civilian use, was built at New Zealand Airfield from October 1943 to July 1953.\nAn old school house in the village has been converted into a museum, open to the public.\nTwo of the roads which led up to the barracks and which were used by the Royal New Zealand Air Force are still in

The Honor System is known by names such as: H.O.F.I.A.H.T. (Home Office Honor Code and Honor and Integrity Committee), F.U.S.I.N. (For You and Serving Integrity Network), P.E.O.S. (Person of Service), and P.D.M.T.R.T. (Permanent Disciplinary and Maximum Retribution Team). The University maintains a policy stating that honor code violations will not be tolerated. Honor Code violations are considered minor infractions. There are no punishments. Most graduating students have passed the honorcode multiple times and are very successful because of it. The Honor Code is used with serious violations. Honor Code violations are serious infractions and carry serious consequences. These are typically cases where students have been charged with a felony and are currently awaiting sentencing. The University has hired three H.O.F.I.A.H.T. personnel to help with student matters. A student accused of committing an honor code violation is not allowed to receive a scholarship or other forms of assistance from the school. Any student charged and convicted of a felony will be barred from receiving graduate credit in the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and any graduate degree conferred on that student by the University. Further actions may be based on student conduct. It is not expected that the University will provide legal representation for any student charged with a felony but that the students should be aware of this possibility as it may be of assistance in an effort to avoid a criminal charge. One of the most important parts for every student to be familiar with is the College Code of Student Conduct. A student accused of an offense within the college code of conduct will not be allowed to receive a scholarship or other forms of financial support. For more information concerning specific infractions, the Code of Student Conduct can be consulted. The following are some infractions not covered by the university honor code. A student is allowed to bring in food to parties if it is consumed on-site. The following are some infractions not covered by the college code of student conduct.

{"prompt":"By 1920 , what is now DE 261 existed as a county road . When Delaware first assigned state highway numbers by 1936 , what is now DE 261 had been upgraded to a state","text":"By 1920, what is now DE 261 existed as a county road. When Delaware first assigned state highway numbers by 1936, what is now DE 261 had been upgraded to a state highway. By 1972, what is now DE 261 existed as a state highway known as Delaware State Route 25. In 1997, the state of Delaware created what is now State Route 41. As in 2007 and 2014, there were no state highway references to what was once Delaware State Route 41 in the state legislative records. At best, what is now Delaware State Route 41 might have merely been a state highway designation before 1997, but there appears to have been no effort to update the designation to reflect current changes in alignment. There is no roadway on the map in Delaware showing what is now Delaware State Route 41 which can be used by motorists as a reference about this portion of the road.\nThis project is part of Delaware\u2019s Comprehensive Plan for Economic Growth, Jobs, and Infrastructure. We will begin this phase of DE 311 next summer by adding an intersection with Main Street in West Elizabeth. We will begin this phase of DE 461 in fall through this winter. Our plan for improving transportation systems on these two roads will be complete by October 2019. In a few years, our vision will be a place where both DE 461 and the newly completed sections of DE 311 will be paving the way for prosperity in Delaware communities.\nWe have two priorities for improving our transportation systems: Main Street access and bicycle and pedestrian access.\nWe need to make full use of the many potential opportunities to increase Main Street usage. The first and best step is to allow people living and visiting the Township of West Elizabeth to easily travel to shops and restaurants on Main Street by creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian crossings. This would help to improve access through both a direct route for residents and residents looking to get to Main Street from a nearby park.\nIn addition to helping us achieve our economic development goals and improve the quality of life in our communities, having safer routes for bicyclists and pedestrians will not only help to keep people happier, it will also help reduce our carbon foot prints by encouraging more people to use their bikes.\nOur first step with this project will be to add a bike lane in West Elizabeth to the intersection of Main Street and West Union Avenue and the intersection of Main Street and South Union Avenue. This bike lane will be separate from the roadway. This allows drivers safe access to Main Street and will be safe for cyclists. When completed, this lane will connect with the bike lanes in East Elizabeth and serve as a connection for biking and walking the communities of West Elizabeth and East Elizabeth.\nThe bike lanes will be visible. In addition to creating a connection between the towns of West Elizabeth and East Elizabeth, the bike lanes will be visually distinct and easily seen. They are not just markers on the ground. The use of reflective tape will help.\nThis project will also include a pedestrian crossing at Main Street and West Union Avenue. At this pedestrian crossing, there will be a new pedestrian walkway that will provide safe access for pedestrians and cyclists.

These new leads were","text":"Gordon was again arrested on 13 January 2004. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads. These new leads were investigated but did not lead to Gordon taking formal custody of the boy in April 2004.\nAfter the boy's death, Gordon stated that he wished to cooperate with authorities but added, \"It could get me hung out to dry, so I didn't want to hurt anyone\". When asked in the wake of news reports regarding the disappearance of the child if it had occurred and in what circumstances, Gordon replied, \"I do not have an opinion\". He denied ever having a reason to kill the child and said the case seemed \"riddled with holes\" and that no one would believe him.\nThe police said they believed the boy was killed and that he would be buried in a field. When questioned about his actions, Gordon admitted, \"I thought it would do the kid some good and put him in a better place\".\n\nTrial and conviction\n\nOn 22 December 2004, Gordon was convicted of murder. The jury found him guilty with 18 adult and nine juvenile co-defendants. One juvenile of no prior criminal history was found guilty of second degree murder, and eight juvenile co-conspirators were convicted of second degree murder and second degree robbery.\nGordon stated that he felt remorse and blamed himself for the deaths and \"wanted to spend the rest of his life in prison\". He was sentenced to prison life.\n\nControversy\n\nGordon was sentenced to a prison term of 30 life years plus 1,260 years, however, he was granted his release after seven years. Gordon was not charged with attempted murder, the child being his grandson. He also did not face possible execution, instead being put on the list for potential electrocution. \nAt the time of his conviction, Gordon was not known to any medical staffs as the only reason he was released was that he didn't think it justified continuing to keep him in prison. According to the court, he didn't make use of his release privilege and didn't take any medication. Gordon spent more than 90 days in the prison's psychiatric ward after his sentence.\nGordon attempted suicide in prison and was hospitalised for an overdose of medication. After recovering, he appeared on BBC radio's Big Issue and admitted to not thinking about suicide during his 15 years in prison.

Gordon is now in police custody. According to The Register, a spokesman said: \n\"After 15 years in custody, it has become too difficult to maintain this case.

{"prompt":"A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on September 10 , while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles . After six hours , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm","text":"A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression early on September 10, while located about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. After six hours, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edelia.\nThe storm initially slowed slightly as it moved northward along the Gulf Stream, but accelerated later in the day as it moved eastward across the Azores. At 1400 UTC on September 16, Edelia was located about 1,800 km north of the Galapagos, just west of the Ecuador Island chain. It moved at 20 knots (37 kilometers per hour) and was about 275 km southeast of the Galapagos and was headed northeastward. In addition to a strong surface high pressure center, Edelia featured a weak surface low pressure center to its northeast, which led to what was expected to be a slight intensification of the storm.\nHowever, two days before that, the Galapagos weather service decided to activate their first alert level, which corresponded to a tropical storm watch issued two days earlier ( Friday, September 14), indicating Edelia was in the northern sector of the Lesser Antilles, with very good visibility. During the watch period, the high over the Galapagos Islands increased, with a slight cooling, which prompted the Galapagos weather service to activate the first alert level on Saturday ( September 15) to reflect increased risk of severe weather, with high pressure gradients to the south, and the storm was forecast to shift south of the Lesser Antilles. With the Galapagos weather service on alert, a second alert level was activated, indicating that severe weather could occur in the area. The most recent forecast was that with the storm further to the south, Edelia would make an unsteady adjustment of speed and direction across the northern Lesser Antilles, between the Lesser Antilles Islands and the Central Lesser Antilles Island to the northeast of Martinique. Later, Edelia may be displaced south of the Lesser Antilles islands to the southwest of Martinique and possibly through the Turks and Caicos Islands. The forecast was continued this Tuesday, with a risk of tropical storm, possible tropical cyclone, or hurricanes, as Edelia might become stronger.\nEdelia continued to accelerate after arriving in the western North Atlantic Ocean and weakened rapidly as it became extratropical and dissipated early on September 21. The meteorological center reported that Edelia was at that time located about 1,600 miles ( 2,700 km) to the north-northeast of Bermuda. They noted that since Edelia moved far from the Galapagos Islands, there had almost no impact or effect over the islands.\nThe storm was named Edelia according to Edella, a nickname for the former British island of St. Helena ( an Isle of Cedros). Edelia was the third named storm in Atlantic hurricanes of the year ( the others being Matthew and Emily ). It was the first named storm to occur in September 2000 in the Atlantic Ocean, which started in 2001.\nPrevious PostWind Energy\u2019s Biggest Market in the United StatesNext PostVestas introduces three new offshore wind turbine models for the French market","token_len":643,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,8.6352,4.6588,0.3852,2.5337,3.5271,5.418,1.5925,5.9085,3.7159,0.5614,6.942,10.4802,3.0023,6.716,0.4146,4.6128,1.9491,0.0001,0.2766,1.5964,9.8025,0.1332,0.5378,0.0039,0.7323,5.1249,6.1434,2.1467,1.2148,0.7082,4.2721,6.3668,3.0806,7.5574,1.2274,9.2203,10.1467,1.9996,1.3569,10.7906,2.254,5.9394,5.7568,5.4953,2.8713,0.4554,1.6394,2.5292,1.2931,3.3982,0.2925,3.8482,1.4982,0.8388,0.9295,4.6865,5.0768,1.2542,0.1363,0.9982,2.1515,0.4045,1.473,2.2628,0.3724,4.5517,0.2806,8.2221,0.0745,0.9422,3.7286,8.7179,1.7598,1.3885,0.3845,3.7206,0.107,3.5779,0.1371,2.1907,4.1182,1.9314,3.9829,0.7576,3.3007,2.9329,2.567,0.3492,1.3258,5.8084,0.5297,0.001,3.7435,3.788,2.6014,0.0029,0.9523,5.7256,8.0305,5.6522,0.4213,2.8817,3.0689,2.9268,5.5912,1.7884,2.2588,5.5711,5.2735,0.1478,0.2193,0.3332,1.9316,1.6541,2.9318,7.2624,0.9265,3.153,0.0845,0.891,3.7533,0.0113,0.0004,3.9837,3.4003,5.7463,3.0753,2.324,1.4663,4.2475,2.6762,0.8224,3.5038,3.1759,6.1256,6.8846,0.4628,7.119,0.4466,2.1187,0.039,7.7433,1.2246,4.4946,3.8818,1.9168,0.043,0.2834,5.8749,3.5788,2.0656,1.5368,2.1624,4.1494,0.2433,6.7176,1.6279,3.5752,0.0413,0.0195,0.5548,4.6576,8.2995,0.0318,0.5035,0.4323,2.1589,1.9152,0.7874,5.3877,0.0366,6.2648,2.0975,2.556,4.7833,0.5664,1.0203,5.0508,0.004,0.0005,6.0279,1.7515,5.9562,0.3557,7.0941,4.2549,6.1886,5.0718,5.5707,2.2067,1.7264,7.441,0.0462,0.4678,1.581,2.3371,0.8302,5.5377,5.6338,6.2097,0.2165,0.8539,4.1406,10.7282,0.5409,0.547,3.31,5.0233,4.5926,4.4106,0.0872,0.9606,3.1187,0.8499,4.8996,6.1757,0.2105,0.1604,8.402,0.0013,0.0081,0.0001,2.8583,3.37,5.969,5.2146,2.1343,0.837,5.0262,1.0129,3.7555,2.8021,0.1911,1.1723,5.3186,8.4057,4.2031,1.668,0.0038,0.0009,4.1004,4.887,2.8478,2.3092,2.0364,3.8509,5.9163,3.9646,3.2904,4.3419,0.8536,2.4251,0.0137,0.0007,3.01,0.05,0.0746,2.7071,1.7239,2.162,0.703,0.1728,2.2996,3.2003,3.0335,0.9567,1.3638,1.9037,2.1532,4.3445,5.0163,4.8461,0.6969,3.2158,1.4567,3.2825,2.9073,3.5214,5.0109,9.5945,0.0449,3.9473,0.4224,2.6,2.0248,1.5911,3.7548,4.1954,5.0837,3.4635,0.0984,5.6355,2.523,4.8961,0.4122,5.5815,0.0019,0.0144,0.0002,1.5298,5.7632,1.3852,3.6032,0.0033,0.0007,3.2797,0.0706,4.9623,1.2874,0.7994,3.5832,3.7488,1.5593,0.2576,0.591,3.1178,2.9012,4.291,1.634,5.1325,0.5908,3.6087,2.4468,1.772,0.281,3.3502,1.2708,2.4545,5.8587,1.6943,3.9119,2.7669,3.0695,6.6992,1.4827,2.322,6.8439,5.8649,0.2278,1.5246,0.3964,1.9502,0.1687,0.9238,4.8107,3.8399,10.887,0.2465,0.0044,7.8082,4.0068,5.7004,1.6904,1.5496,5.8746,0.0888,4.4263,7.5187,0.0094,0.0302,0.0002,1.2824,7.4826,0.9643,5.2815,0.0059,0.0645,0.0004,6.801,0.2408,0.3893,5.4145,7.1269,0.0264,0.119,0.0006,4.8021,4.8572,1.5234,3.0376,3.2551,10.6026,0.0928,0.8759,7.5442,1.7298,4.0307,0.0747,4.4679,2.1698,8.2081,4.0751,1.4159,0.3332,2.1483,0.0014,0.0062,0.0002,4.9832,2.0935,0.3949,3.7564,1.0891,1.7175,0.0001,2.1125,2.4817,4.5584,0.5599,6.4709,0.0893,0.0097,0.0002,0.0016,0.195,1.0424,2.5513,4.6553,2.3923,7.0386,5.6987,6.7407,1.4966,3.289,1.5036,6.6276,0.3549,3.8122,0.7094,4.9695,6.5432,3.1599,1.4869,0.0266,0.5481,2.1159,6.1251,2.7612,2.3821,6.1772,0.0709,4.4937,3.2098,3.9086,1.6283,0.4669,4.0949,0.1604,3.485,0.2156,5.6935,4.5944,4.68,0.83,0.4722,4.089,7.3461,1.1086,1.9847,3.1619,6.9858,4.0784,2.7496,0.1443,5.7263,11.0708,0.2572,0.0104,0.2641,2.2885,7.1786,0.011,5.0768,1.2186,0.613,3.8043,0.6048,1.6,8.2455,0.2579,3.9115,3.6722,1.0711,2.6062,0.0417,1.084,3.7766,7.1237,0.5066,4.2551,0.7584,2.5014,0.0656,2.4375,4.4842,2.4486,8.374,0.027,2.9649,0.2389,0.0843,5.7364,0.2635,2.0841,2.6997,3.1311,0.0031,0.008,0.254,5.9516,1.303,7.645,2.759,0.3558,6.2922,2.8659,0.025,2.5694,6.682,2.3313,0.4534,3.057,0.0046,0.0003,1.4064,0.7603,2.858,3.1983,8.6542,1.6392,3.9622,5.5954,5.2986,6.3221,0.3147,3.293,0.9871,1.3791,1.536,2.0277,1.8242,5.7701,2.8625,2.385,7.9701,0.0018,5.858,6.3507,3.1708,2.0607,4.0389,2.0789,0.9036,6.6701,4.2863,3.8513,0.7514,4.28,0.2683,1.3949,2.9611,9.5676,7.1591,0.1782,9.8074,3.2745,2.1862,2.4773,1.4905,1.0469,3.1353,2.4154,4.2101,1.4628,1.2257,7.0974,3.8925,3.5886,0.7165,1.6031,2.1327,6.0563,5.927,0.6526,6.9902,1.3039,7.409,1.0559,2.213,0.6567,2.2783,1.873,1.2601,0.7019,1.1132,3.8353,0.7428,6.0294,5.4142,2.3388,0.5853,1.1194,1.7581,1.1226,2.7681,6.0514,2.3332,6.7228,1.0487,1.3381,7.9329,7.8408,9.5411,7.3297,10.8048,7.9775,5.5253,8.3104,0.6905,8.7487,1.7879,0.8997,3.0573,0.0288,12.3647,0.0782,7.6245,6.0348,6.6842,10.7604,5.4145,0.6493,5.6299,0.3394,3.4068,1.6235,2.8439,1.8957,7.4795,2.933]}
{"prompt":"A music video for the song was directed by Lil X on the weekend of July 4 , 2010 in Los Angeles .

Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who they would like to see. After which, the clip went out to a jury and the rest is history. Lil X, known for his previous music videos has directed music videos for Nicki Minaj and is also a former member of the band The Rated R.\nAt the height of their popularity, and with so much publicity upon them, Nicki and Lil X became very paranoid. They hired two armed bodyguards to protect them, a full body guard for each. Although a court heard that it wasn't necessary, their request was granted and they would have to pay a fine of $5000 each to their local police dept. However, the judge later reduced the fines to $200.\nThese were not his only threats. On January 31, 2011 a court hearing, Nicki and Lil X were asked by the court if they would like their guns registered as weapons. During the hearing, Lil X stated they didn't want the guns registered.\nThe day before the court hearing, the two were pulled over by a police car and a judge stated that his gun license was suspended after receiving a report from an anonymous man concerning his violent behavior towards other people.\nOn February 23, 2011 a judge banned the two women from using their Twitter and Facebook accounts, for which they paid a fine. The court heard their behavior was a cause for concern to them.\nOn May 9, 2011 both women paid a fine of $10,000 each for not being in court on December 17, 2010.\nIn July 2012, there was a report and video posted on YouTube, stating the two women were seen getting into a confrontation with security guards at an in-store event with Rihanna.\nOn February 9, 2013, the two women paid a fine of $15,000 each, the most the court had ever ordered for the violation as of that time.\nOn November 6, 2014, these two paid $16,500 each, along with having their wrist watch, ring, and cellphone seized, for their presence and participation in a May 3, 2013 incident in which they physically assaulted a security manager at a nightclub. This is their second violation of the court order, however the first was dismissed.\nIn 2016, the government decided not to prosecute them again, after they had been cleared of all previous accusations. A court hearing was set to be scheduled on May 10, 2017 to determine whether or not they were to face prosecution, however there was no date set as of that time. A court hearing was to be held in April 17, 2017, as the government decided against pressing charges against them.\nOn February 11, 2018, the court hearing for the assault on the security guard was postponed.

{"prompt":"On January 9 , 4 Big Ten points guards ( Burke , Keith Appling , Craft and Andre Hollins ) among the 20 Cousy Award finalists . On January 10 the Wooden Award midseason top","text":"On January 9, 4 Big Ten points guards ( Burke, Keith Appling, Craft and Andre Hollins ) among the 20 Cousy Award finalists. On January 10 the Wooden Award midseason top player choice by national media and coaches was awarded to West Virginia freshman guard Trey Burke ( 6 6 ). This was the first year that the Wooden was awarded based on vote popular opinion. From February 5 through March 7 the conference held its first Big Ten Player of the Year voting contest. A total of 15 finalists were voted upon by the league's 53 coaches. The winner of the voting contest was Illinois sophomore guard Kyle Korver.\n. The first Big Ten Coaches poll of the season took place in late March which was followed by the first Big Ten Men's Basketball All- Conference poll by February 18. The next poll in March showed West Virginia and Iowa leading the rankings for the conference men as well as the poll for the first team as voted on by conference coaches.\n. An all conference men's selection for the second straight year as well as a conference coach's selection included three players from Western Michigan ( De'Andre Hunter, Justin Hamilton and Jerron Willis ) who were also selected for the All-American first party by the media as well as by the coaches. Also in 2003, both the Big Ten and Big 8 conferences added women's teams to their conferences.\n. The conference continued to grow and expanded. From 1984 through the 2002-03 season, 23 schools, 17 from the Midwest, entered the conference. The schools that joined were as follows :. In an effort to improve the conference, the league was forced to move from the March break to a February break. All conference games were delayed by one week and thus conference games were played during the week of February 11. This created a difficult schedule for the conference.\n. In the 2004-05 season, the conference began play as the Big Ten Conference in the Big Ten Conference Tournament at the Holiday Invitational in Chicago which finished April 4, 2005. From April 8 through April 29, 11 games, with the exception of four games on account of the break ( three on March 20, two on March 21 ) were played.\n. The conference was ranked # 11 in the final 2007 Big Ten poll released by the Associated Press on December 3, 2007. Additionally the conference was ranked # 15 by USA Today. The Big Ten Conference is home to many big-time college basketball teams that attract national attention and numerous big-time conferences and is also a conference well regarded for it's strength throughout the country with a long tradition.\n. The Big Ten Conference voted on January 6, 2015 to be among the Big Five Conference leagues in the ACC, Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, and SEC in order for the league to qualify for the NCAA Tournament. The Big Ten announced that its bid did not pass.\n.

The couple separated for about eight years; however, their divorce remains confidential and has not been announced.","token_len":645,"entropy":[6.0124,8.9022,10.6095,1.9368,8.8408,0.5666,4.8334,2.0773,6.8741,7.3476,5.2619,2.0895,5.8457,0.4398,2.9544,12.3016,0.3675,0.1016,7.9942,1.1957,9.6451,9.2941,7.0092,4.4157,2.6556,1.5916,8.5609,0.0083,2.8053,3.8873,0.7346,6.7171,9.126,1.302,3.7042,6.6359,3.1634,1.8244,0.0181,0.0038,1.0706,9.1898,4.3686,9.2251,6.6988,0.7223,1.4171,5.2565,0.5026,0.0339,6.5664,0.1069,0.2381,0.0031,1.0853,1.9053,7.8821,2.3765,0.2111,0.8449,6.348,4.6656,6.9934,6.2634,3.3672,1.6205,4.6339,0.034,0.4617,0.0023,1.4456,4.003,0.1892,2.5243,0.5853,0.7008,4.9331,3.3074,5.4364,2.4541,2.0939,0.2564,4.1501,5.0452,2.5384,0.0043,0.0019,1.8411,2.6374,4.5841,0.729,1.7333,0.0068,0.1944,1.0508,2.8281,4.1862,2.7156,0.869,0.4338,4.1911,0.475,2.8548,2.497,2.1466,2.0697,0.3945,8.2883,1.517,0.2521,0.946,2.1212,2.8975,0.3137,2.1404,2.3783,2.892,1.1047,0.0638,0.1073,1.1101,4.5806,4.5232,4.3957,1.5179,2.028,5.2012,7.1389,4.1082,7.1885,9.4339,9.8844,0.1523,0.0749,0.1101,0.0052,0.0009,0.0005,0.0001,0.8089,7.1309,0.0371,4.1215,1.639,2.3329,4.7637,0.6741,1.5076,3.3832,0.0047,4.7968,0.8985,1.0081,0.7154,1.1994,1.1353,1.8026,0.0571,0.4855,3.6985,4.0164,1.174,1.1677,0.7579,3.6532,2.2848,2.6771,1.3131,6.6056,5.5752,0.0943,2.7055,4.2847,0.1906,0.4809,1.7905,2.7028,0.0342,2.5721,4.5456,8.1188,5.641,0.8535,0.0166,2.1495,0.8505,5.1393,2.3488,0.0231,0.5643,2.0264,0.0207,0.5983,1.3091,1.828,4.0185,0.5138,6.5527,0.2303,6.0873,3.9517,0.5039,0.7725,1.204,2.411,2.1604,0.8562,0.621,4.9975,0.0708,1.3661,8.5809,3.1746,1.2052,0.8135,1.1626,0.0554,0.3735,2.2131,3.3282,0.0019,5.7044,0.7989,1.6358,6.7924,0.6052,3.1814,3.1725,6.8323,2.0918,0.3996,0.3305,0.5748,2.6326,4.4047,5.3405,0.1575,0.1706,0.0044,0.7462,1.9258,2.2901,0.125,4.1801,5.1264,0.0299,10.4568,0.031,0.9319,6.2667,8.0491,0.7518,2.6614,8.4953,0.2174,5.9342,5.2231,6.8495,1.1295,1.0213,0.7792,2.4492,0.0567,0.4389,4.8533,2.1008,2.7986,1.5858,7.796,0.6217,7.2328,0.0144,0.0156,0.0464,10.9538,0.7224,13.2646,7.242,0.5948,1.7325,1.0634,0.0018,0.0725,0.0014,2.643,3.262,6.9204,1.3722,5.2912,0.781,2.6035,1.1247,1.6545,1.5634,2.3606,4.4797,0.4817,0.5645,4.8226,0.5453,6.0929,6.7966,7.364,0.1219,1.2306,2.0095,0.1304,3.2065,0.9022,2.6225,0.0164,0.8633,1.1839,0.8358,3.7108,0.0544,0.3757,4.9651,1.0617,8.292,6.589,0.7565,3.5476,0.1505,1.9384,8.5344,3.2616,0.1333,0.792,0.8219,2.6972,0.0096,3.5816,0.8162,6.0758,0.8559,1.9408,2.7918,1.6443,0.0269,0.1612,0.8337,2.4314,2.4242,4.2905,7.2832,0.0194,0.8787,1.4553,4.3414,0.8241,6.5477,1.5189,4.0359,0.8303,3.3175,0.008,0.0008,2.1002,6.129,6.112,4.7929,4.4067,2.9764,2.0515,2.7121,0.0209,1.0556,4.2281,0.0843,0.6685,6.2513,5.1543,3.4459,1.5113,4.7332,5.2385,8.3402,5.3604,0.3962,0.8968,3.1416,0.0581,2.5176,4.3656,2.0257,4.1066,0.0207,0.1192,5.5048,1.2503,5.6179,5.8242,0.7931,1.609,0.6941,4.918,2.474,2.6099,0.2579,2.5781,5.3176,1.6051,3.44,1.2599,0.6093,2.5065,1.9101,3.1202,0.0037,3.2185,2.2522,1.9922,7.8714,5.5,5.7684,6.3769,0.8745,0.8105,2.9262,2.3462,2.7733,0.0043,0.2234,0.4718,2.5852,0.5787,0.0025,5.007,7.7047,1.0162,2.4032,3.9906,2.5327,4.4767,1.4069,4.3719,0.0955,5.9589,3.4281,3.8809,9.1966,0.6532,0.4038,0.1377,2.2728,1.4904,7.4551,1.1958,8.016,0.6188,1.1385,1.4984,2.3044,0.0097,0.0008,3.0416,2.3501,1.7908,2.9697,0.0139,3.6441,7.9797,0.0564,5.7366,0.0668,3.6074,5.124,3.8346,11.9104,2.0015,2.0662,2.0321,0.0024,5.2169,0.0765,6.4563,2.0988,0.021,6.6443,0.4372,0.4623,2.8179,6.2195,1.8803,1.2309,1.5253,0.9209,4.0731,0.037,0.4014,2.4752,3.8291,5.9643,3.1994,5.0995,3.1022,0.003,0.1357,1.8797,2.5731,2.7152,0.2977,1.4214,0.0224,0.4424,2.5999,0.6854,3.3853,0.0529,0.4328,4.6294,0.727,0.9247,1.1279,1.2555,4.0267,1.6879,3.9185,3.6524,8.4587,0.8594,0.0442,3.8024,6.322,0.4521,2.8455,2.6745,0.2156,0.002,1.844,3.4603,0.347,3.2475,1.5332,0.5179,0.0017,4.5645,6.0451,1.089,2.6112,1.5985,0.0249,1.3045,4.514,3.12,1.1408,0.5032,6.1533,0.0335,0.4117,3.3598,3.544,2.1125,1.7513,5.3972,1.3182,1.8402,0.8189,1.817,2.1333,1.0124,3.1893,4.4917,5.4624,2.1399,0.5401,2.5182,3.6077,6.158,0.6702,4.0925,0.0024,1.6997,1.3317,0.7456,3.4671,5.1034,2.0052,1.7774,0.5178,1.0078,0.5691,2.8448,0.0306,3.1685,0.7002,3.2526,1.885,5.9338,0.8863,1.5484,5.9557,2.8799,0.0276,2.1624,0.1995,1.797,0.4705,2.4964,6.0034,0.4501,2.5324,1.0309,1.2727,5.0244,2.135,0.0281,1.9988,0.1507,3.3245,2.2561,1.1085,2.1508,5.4974,0.7801,0.301,4.3292,1.7265,1.0648,0.9755,5.1411,1.1548,0.0722,2.6434,0.2307,5.1695,5.0,3.301,4.2529,1.3671,6.0775,3.6934,0.0126,3.7,3.7497,5.0137,5.0034,2.8685,3.4354,0.4947,0.116,3.7131,0.3715]}
{"prompt":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development . The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean and began to show signs of organized","text":"A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean and began to show signs of organized weather system about 200 NM to 280 NM east of the Mexican border. The system moved west and northward into the central Northeastern Pacific Ocean at high speeds. By the next day, organized weather patterns near and above normal pressure ridge over the North and Northwest Pacific Ocean were observed. Surface pressure pattern, observed high cloud level (about 850 mb), and cold air advection were observed near the Northwest Pacific. The system slowly moved into the northeastern Pacific. As the front approached the southwestern corner of California, a thunderstorm front moved ahead and dissipated. A broad area of precipitation extended from northern Baja California to Baja California Sur. In the Northern Hemisphere the Pacific Northwest rained below average as a result of moisture advection from the southwest of the continent and increased moisture from the warm Caribbean Sea.\nIn the mid-November a large circulation pattern developed west of the United States and continued through the end of the month. This pattern began to develop in mid-November and was strongest in the mid-to-late part of October. The largest depression developed about mid-february in the mid-northeastern United States. After that depression developed, a ridge developed over the northeastern United States, extending westward to Canada and across the Atlantic Ocean to the western Atlantic Ocean and Europe. A second front moved westward over the eastern Canadian Highlands. The surface pressure pattern of the eastern United States consisted of high pressure, and a depression developed to the south and southwest of the continental United States. Then the atmospheric circulation pattern developed to the east of the United States during the first week of the month.\nDuring the first half of November, large circulation was observed in the Central Atlantic Ocean. High pressure developed, which moved northwestward. After passing through Portugal, the pressure pattern became anticyclonic and began to move from the west. The atmospheric pressure pattern consisted of a low-level inversion at heights greater than 200 m below sea level. The pattern also consisted of a second inversion at above 1200 m. The air advected from the east in the mid-northern Atlantic ocean was cool and dry in comparison to air advected from the west. During the month a storm developed in the northern Atlantic, the first time it had occurred in 10 years. Heavy rains in Europe and the United Kingdom were responsible for the development of the system. Heavy rain and sleet developed from mid-January to the end of February, covering most of England. In the United States some rain was also reported in the northwestern areas of Maryland and Virginia. Heavy rain resulted in a surge of the Potomac River. In Europe heavy rains affected both the northern and southern parts of Europe. Heavy snow fell in areas of the northern hemisphere. Precipitation events were observed in all the latitudes and longitudes of the globe. Surface moisture content and air temperature showed a wide range of values associated with events. The highest value of the air moisture was observed on Dec. 26 in the mid-Atlantic region.","token_len":645,"entropy":[11.6242,6.3085,6.6992,5.0789,0.5811,0.8483,0.1744,5.1382,2.2947,5.4386,0.5367,1.7929,1.1883,3.6295,10.4448,4.3423,7.1444,6.6998,7.1678,1.2311,1.9304,3.7435,6.9031,0.5326,6.0873,1.9203,0.7182,2.0338,4.3143,1.2517,6.2338,1.2032,0.0061,11.3352,5.4631,4.7209,8.8676,4.1889,11.6166,4.9807,6.1246,0.4158,4.3056,0.5844,0.7485,4.9338,0.6488,0.6154,1.4975,6.5072,4.1808,2.4668,2.8679,4.0953,2.2227,3.6441,0.4777,3.7884,9.2038,0.023,0.8005,0.7546,3.9,5.4662,2.299,1.3275,4.9893,1.1812,5.8269,1.31,0.5078,10.065,1.0385,4.0838,7.7182,3.32,2.3055,5.2445,7.4559,9.0149,5.3256,0.6943,3.3806,3.7061,4.9188,0.9005,1.7257,1.7167,2.1612,0.5921,7.2769,3.7185,5.7943,4.3237,5.5665,7.2822,8.3966,4.6352,3.9034,5.6874,5.6992,1.4902,3.6055,1.5358,1.5535,5.7266,2.1745,10.5146,0.2875,0.1102,2.4285,1.0219,3.2699,0.7216,6.1152,0.7476,2.2036,1.4745,3.6907,5.9089,1.0432,3.4479,0.5243,4.6829,0.4806,2.974,4.5293,0.9083,7.4931,7.4259,0.8714,5.6395,4.2141,0.1215,8.1468,0.5383,2.555,4.9804,0.093,7.5668,2.7925,6.3001,1.6791,5.51,0.0055,1.8296,2.9616,6.7701,3.5747,0.3253,4.1713,6.347,1.777,4.6319,5.5987,0.0364,0.0485,0.6187,5.4546,0.0246,0.1475,7.4661,1.5403,3.4002,0.9091,5.0146,0.8341,2.5398,5.9044,3.6469,8.1009,0.9746,6.102,3.7956,4.6448,1.6564,0.3377,0.0382,6.2137,8.4678,0.0028,0.0148,2.5759,0.7771,4.6809,2.8911,0.6688,3.1854,2.1268,5.3254,3.126,2.5416,0.3043,7.7682,6.1297,1.0361,0.6517,2.8251,8.7088,1.0712,4.2413,0.4146,5.564,6.886,2.9133,6.9725,2.1812,2.7879,5.5405,0.556,0.4724,4.5931,0.0304,1.5674,4.7688,3.5704,0.8308,4.7649,0.0083,1.4681,1.461,0.8471,2.5163,1.5865,3.5983,1.0619,2.4655,1.6221,3.3741,0.2509,1.1553,1.0586,2.7513,6.9824,0.7473,0.5184,3.8112,0.178,2.9157,0.0898,0.3898,5.4,0.0062,2.8952,0.5225,1.3699,6.057,8.367,4.1083,5.0528,3.4809,0.0933,9.7788,4.6873,0.0813,2.6897,0.5471,4.6579,0.3519,7.0515,2.546,2.2338,2.8304,0.0038,0.9439,5.2298,4.3117,4.4104,2.7261,1.9248,2.8018,5.7427,3.2059,2.4684,0.5967,4.2149,1.8595,0.0022,2.1511,3.0598,2.9078,0.6711,2.3721,5.7775,1.1265,4.9174,0.5377,1.3168,0.363,3.8032,0.821,3.8294,3.6882,1.4194,2.4608,7.1072,0.19,2.7701,5.2687,4.7788,3.3627,2.343,0.6242,3.7381,0.54,2.6658,5.7585,6.9108,2.046,1.4108,6.289,1.4395,0.4571,3.7257,0.6656,5.172,2.6143,0.0018,8.1985,0.4076,3.8846,3.8683,2.3801,4.3892,2.8236,5.8184,1.8502,4.6648,0.9282,2.1588,3.0142,2.5111,0.8752,0.6083,3.2098,0.3283,0.0024,0.5116,6.1609,1.6617,6.1065,0.883,1.074,2.7425,2.6444,0.8369,2.5247,1.9069,0.2766,1.0248,0.0035,5.6726,0.4838,2.7886,2.5283,0.141,3.8819,0.8972,0.7448,2.0863,3.5691,0.4232,1.7431,3.6158,0.0147,1.3169,1.4549,4.3545,2.3269,4.667,0.54,1.1331,0.3961,4.3376,3.4192,1.3788,1.2886,4.9735,2.013,3.714,3.7682,4.8806,3.94,2.8443,0.6988,3.5588,4.3163,6.8016,0.9092,7.9963,0.9678,1.1482,3.7934,1.3168,3.9294,9.6924,0.637,0.6235,0.1297,1.519,3.613,0.1502,1.905,5.462,1.102,3.5081,3.2787,1.3164,3.5157,4.0127,0.3263,6.5353,0.0549,2.4782,3.159,2.6729,3.5235,6.0205,0.8702,4.3019,8.2142,4.7127,0.0183,3.9262,0.4035,5.2203,1.6579,0.0145,0.8208,1.2187,3.4243,4.7462,4.8968,0.0074,1.0017,7.6212,4.5696,0.0151,1.5275,6.6967,7.5523,0.2382,1.7776,1.1353,5.1616,7.7554,0.0034,5.5944,2.143,3.1811,0.8294,3.4841,3.8713,0.9985,3.1662,0.1994,3.5222,6.9852,3.8284,5.0324,3.0093,6.3234,1.1325,2.6167,3.4089,2.7258,0.5867,5.0104,2.0527,0.0021,0.0948,0.0469,0.2525,0.1214,0.7779,0.5237,3.619,0.2877,4.1605,4.7864,3.7765,4.2337,1.6902,0.422,3.3024,2.3911,2.705,4.4381,3.7333,5.519,2.3883,1.49,2.7193,1.1147,6.0603,0.3957,0.2769,7.0272,2.4111,3.3646,5.6921,1.2603,1.3199,1.8733,5.4653,2.561,5.2127,0.082,0.8365,2.5427,0.086,0.9248,3.2188,0.24,5.2334,1.2187,3.3318,4.692,0.0181,5.0988,3.0692,3.7897,0.1367,3.2932,0.6927,3.3734,0.6189,0.0016,1.5739,2.2601,6.8331,2.7486,0.0419,4.7976,1.349,2.7063,0.7271,2.7629,0.3482,5.9636,2.9543,2.0469,4.3443,3.2206,1.7444,1.1788,5.9089,6.1144,0.5431,4.4427,0.9038,1.6334,0.484,4.1844,1.0107,5.0252,0.497,2.1588,5.3655,1.0739,4.5373,9.7616,0.0157,0.0002,0.7707,2.0531,2.6684,4.6324,2.302,1.422,5.6819,4.7987,1.1902,3.6009,0.2859,0.4292,2.0861,0.0099,2.6635,0.6265,3.2009,4.4296,2.5366,1.0317,4.8132,1.3049,1.3494,3.111,3.4127,1.2693,6.6875,0.0098,0.0043,7.1767,1.9245,2.0643,0.8352,4.634,2.7207,6.2262,0.0449,1.7782,3.2704,0.0438,0.87,0.5754,3.6786,0.56,5.2695,3.0372,3.782,3.3587,3.5843,1.7328,5.3874,1.9831,5.5836,0.5139,0.7034,2.2691,6.1971,0.0093,7.2674,1.4718,1.6996,4.357,3.1536,1.9166,2.2971,4.9543,4.4609,2.5734,2.3198,3.1894,6.1336,0.2105,3.5843,2.668,0.9273,4.9587,0.149,0.7113,2.2496,1.2852]}
{"prompt":"The genus name , Salvia , was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely Salvia officinalis ( common sage ) and is derived from the Latin < unk > . The specific","text":"The genus name, Salvia, was first used by Pliny for a plant that was likely Salvia officinalis ( common sage ) and is derived from the Latin < unk >. The specific epithet was given to the senior author by the late Professor Robert M. Sussman, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Other members of the genus Salvia often have a similar and distinct odor.\nThe plant is a perennial that usually grows at a height of 2-5 feet above the ground, although it can grow to a height of 10 feet. It has a round, flattened, or slightly flattened stem that is mostly covered with small, short, sharp, lance-shaped silver-white or nearly white hairs and sometimes with short, short hairs that are greenish in color. The leaves are opposite and usually appear in late summer, in late summer, and in August and September. The leaves are lance-shaped or elliptical in shape, and they have a short, slightly hairy margin. The flowers are borne in opposite pairs at the end of the stems and are usually white to pale yellow or pale pink in color. They have 5 sepals and 5 petals and they bloom in late summer and in September. The fruit is a capsule that is either hairy, smooth, or completely smooth. It is usually white or yellow in color, and it often matures in January.\nThe plant grows best in USDA plant hardiness zones 5 through 9. It blooms from mid-summer through the fall, and it tends to bloom throughout the year in cool-to-warm climates.\nWhen you plant Salvia chamaemelis in your garden, you\u2019ll have no problems with insect or fungal disease. The plant tolerates most soil types, though it prefers well-drained, well-draining, siliceous, or silt loam soil.\nBecause the plant is heat and sun tolerant in the landscape, it\u2019s not unusual to have the plant grow in areas where it\u2019s not expected to withstand full sun, and that is true even in the colder northern regions. In warmer areas, this plant tends to prefer dappled and filtered shade.\nWhen planting in the ground, you can do so in spring, but the most important point to remember is not to top-dress the entire plant with soil. Instead, cover the roots only with a thin layer of soil. This will help retain moisture for the spring planting and provide a much more secure root system for the plant.\nWhen growing plants to be used in landscapes, Salvia chamaemelis tends to have a low weed problem. This makes the plant an easy choice for landscaping because the colorful sprigs of flowers will draw insect pollinators to your garden.\nSalvia chamaemelis is a plant that is ideal for small spaces because its small size provides a neat arrangement on the patio.\nThis plant can grow into a thick mat if you plant it in large areas, and it can be cut back in the late spring season or early summer so the plant can recover after a harsh winter.","token_len":645,"entropy":[11.4236,4.174,2.9859,7.2629,2.5503,2.7242,2.4821,2.1077,1.955,1.3448,7.1788,0.3091,4.5399,2.4585,6.0446,2.2901,1.5793,6.7878,8.0628,0.667,3.3688,0.0263,0.0036,2.1054,12.3329,8.5649,3.4797,1.6163,3.4362,4.7023,0.0318,0.6926,2.1145,9.7197,10.7916,7.7314,4.5141,1.8323,1.8231,7.536,5.8851,0.0135,2.569,3.3969,1.175,1.0292,10.4264,5.1524,2.3383,2.2746,3.2057,4.4723,4.3116,4.0542,0.2325,4.6979,4.395,0.6215,1.3095,5.7661,0.0437,3.3263,0.8542,0.1513,0.0004,0.0,0.0515,0.0,0.0002,0.8302,5.8885,4.7064,0.2517,0.393,0.3575,3.0963,0.1527,8.1587,2.675,1.7326,2.5662,4.3884,3.3126,3.8108,1.4676,1.7813,7.3799,5.5168,1.6482,2.8591,2.4593,3.9616,4.7572,1.2427,4.1996,3.0625,1.9088,0.1058,3.196,2.1522,2.4123,0.829,3.2334,1.1204,0.1154,1.8546,3.7356,1.3411,1.3915,1.0588,1.755,2.9662,0.2856,0.241,3.1972,0.7661,1.2163,1.527,2.4075,1.0006,6.4307,1.1857,4.7856,1.7788,3.7541,4.8916,2.3431,3.5445,2.424,1.3029,5.2004,3.1646,1.0086,3.846,1.614,5.032,1.126,5.269,1.8206,7.0982,1.0491,0.2245,1.489,10.4803,1.7776,3.3289,3.6749,8.1419,1.972,1.6834,4.0319,4.0087,3.0667,3.4144,0.4146,3.7929,2.3998,2.2486,1.0807,6.9506,0.6387,2.3777,0.0901,0.5637,1.1872,1.6799,0.5376,11.7619,3.9573,3.8741,4.6294,3.318,4.1801,1.1546,1.9565,3.7299,1.3077,2.9497,0.6395,0.7125,0.4105,5.3911,2.3671,0.1445,0.2727,1.1304,1.3842,0.6462,6.9126,0.6131,0.0959,0.3238,3.653,5.0198,0.0335,1.7017,0.3408,0.844,1.2662,2.3794,1.785,1.2862,3.4762,0.433,4.958,4.6851,5.3806,1.1866,0.7838,2.929,0.4421,6.4543,1.4243,9.0732,3.9756,4.0909,0.7531,2.6663,0.0354,0.685,3.6673,1.8115,1.1034,2.4533,2.8423,2.8603,3.2955,1.52,2.4404,3.2774,2.1977,1.2506,0.1086,0.2611,2.6867,2.0984,7.1341,8.5152,0.2625,1.937,2.8423,5.0533,0.0399,2.585,4.0713,5.755,0.9707,1.2109,1.4381,1.0728,2.4708,2.0816,0.3107,1.0806,4.5669,0.491,2.7521,9.1541,3.082,0.9724,5.826,6.6557,2.1055,5.2437,0.5257,0.5707,5.9402,3.7082,0.5384,2.2072,1.0082,2.4139,2.9189,1.6174,2.9295,0.8857,0.0627,1.68,1.2109,1.3145,4.2231,9.4333,0.012,1.3388,5.0177,1.2542,1.6237,1.1398,1.828,3.9373,4.191,0.496,8.4537,6.8649,6.9282,0.0254,0.4395,3.3601,2.3963,2.3624,1.3834,1.648,5.6455,0.0042,3.6682,3.4965,0.9153,2.4007,0.0045,1.3701,2.5599,1.219,1.7591,1.2431,1.7982,4.6503,0.0574,2.0969,4.995,0.6798,1.8612,2.6351,6.0648,4.796,2.2965,0.0404,2.7939,2.2824,0.3047,1.7827,5.1445,4.328,2.9401,2.3417,0.0058,9.1192,4.7762,5.6854,5.193,3.1115,2.2132,1.5077,0.4865,0.2266,2.054,19.1422,8.3979,1.6307,2.5969,4.7171,3.3757,1.7568,8.1798,2.5238,5.675,0.0001,3.7514,0.561,2.4607,1.2221,8.4014,0.0034,3.403,4.4494,3.0841,1.0734,4.5464,1.3086,4.4897,6.3024,0.3403,0.4914,0.0329,1.9396,2.7361,0.1284,0.2243,3.9396,3.1447,8.8295,5.1796,0.0128,3.0205,1.5269,5.6617,0.6132,9.563,0.1943,1.7924,0.433,2.1272,5.2272,1.7268,0.9161,1.0343,9.8903,6.8639,6.8075,3.9356,5.2478,1.736,10.5744,0.1791,1.1968,7.2961,0.0341,1.461,3.4847,5.7172,0.5847,2.1371,2.987,0.314,2.7679,1.1148,4.2571,1.7704,1.3487,3.1445,0.0198,0.0231,1.9112,3.8237,0.2267,5.5775,6.959,0.5335,2.6329,2.805,4.2565,1.457,4.9325,2.0202,0.7621,2.3128,4.3833,5.733,2.6712,0.8575,3.1084,3.8344,2.8182,0.2531,4.3798,1.8376,4.6227,0.0221,4.4437,7.3086,2.6175,0.005,2.9986,8.8219,5.6938,1.0082,1.1194,3.3953,4.0718,2.2411,2.4094,5.0735,0.2243,2.509,2.7255,4.7696,3.1349,2.0375,5.8394,1.7486,2.4022,2.781,5.5745,1.0746,5.3927,1.1065,1.3009,0.2913,4.9221,0.304,7.5004,3.0123,4.6299,1.0801,6.4889,0.1959,2.8707,3.7852,1.8319,3.5208,0.0631,3.4981,0.9026,3.9921,5.5969,0.7417,1.5122,2.2122,0.2101,0.0416,2.0469,1.955,2.6976,1.2314,1.6745,5.2496,0.6516,3.626,1.1814,4.7786,3.1074,3.7129,3.7471,1.619,4.9476,1.3469,4.4754,4.2501,0.4516,1.773,0.6569,1.8714,0.6673,0.7678,2.677,3.5026,4.3833,4.8649,3.4375,2.6405,1.1039,8.3142,0.7431,4.5847,0.0048,1.6735,0.0108,0.013,0.0096,0.0021,5.1811,0.0289,3.077,0.8747,3.677,5.4959,4.4999,1.2793,2.46,5.1304,2.8421,0.4737,3.5278,3.3417,2.9112,0.3601,2.7621,1.3214,2.558,2.2768,9.2736,6.9861,4.0407,0.1227,1.3793,3.4386,2.0591,5.9502,7.2591,6.4063,0.1216,1.6033,1.836,1.4691,0.3778,1.3358,3.0714,0.0025,0.6739,0.0113,0.0069,0.0048,0.0017,0.911,1.2859,4.8038,0.8967,1.3728,5.8712,0.15,4.6042,4.4125,5.0794,3.6402,4.4677,1.1343,5.0314,1.6823,7.1439,6.122,4.5439,0.927,4.3959,1.0535,2.1853,4.1938,1.3663,2.4898,2.0029,4.298,0.911,6.4306,7.1118,3.9125,1.101,2.8688,0.4262,0.9359,4.1967,1.8015,1.7541,2.3518,1.3204,1.4068,1.268,5.4068,4.7861,2.1493,1.9954,5.2915,1.6055,6.7165,3.6233,1.0672,0.0928,5.097,3.1936,0.9241,0.5985,5.9645,4.2948,2.0993,5.6804,0.2823,0.2671]}

As this rapid transition took place, families lost many of their economic skills, particularly that of sewing. The Industrial Revolution also brought with it a new system of industrial management, involving factory workers with regular production quotas, and a new kind of organisation : the factory. Factory workers in the British Isles were typically paid piece rates, and they did not even receive paid leave. Their hours and working conditions were so harsh that in the 1850s many had to sign contracts claiming that they would not turn over to the police if they were dismissed for drunkenness or industrial revolt.\nThe Industrial Revolution also affected the working conditions of women. Men were hired for the jobs that demanded the most skill and training, leaving the majority of the female population to work under the control and supervision of men while housework, child care and farming were also the preserve of women. In the 19th century, women\u2019s jobs took various forms : domestic servants were paid a set wage, and they were expected to work long hours and to do the bulk of the hard work. Female domestic servants were sometimes exploited by the women they served. For example, in a letter from the British Embassy in Rome in 1853, a domestic servant complained that she was treated like a slave and that she could work only a few hours after her job was finished ( the servant had to keep waiting for his mistress to give him a chance to leave ) ( McWhirter 1971 ). Women were also hired by the textile mills as loomsmen. These loomsmen were expected to keep strict time controls, making sure that they worked to the appointed schedule. Because their wages were lower than those paid to men, some of them were forced to work longer hours or quit.\nWomen generally worked very hard for very low wages. According to historians, many women worked longer hours, were overworked, or were unable to find any employment at all. This led to a dramatic rise in female mortality during the Industrial Revolution. A report commissioned by the Home Office in 1847 estimates that of 20,000 women working at a woollen mill at the time, 13,000 left the factory without dying. But another study suggests that half of all female workers in the textile mills in the 1800s were paid less than one-third of the daily wages earned by a male worker.\nThe Industrial Revolution had an important impact on the lives of people around the world. The rapid increase in consumption brought by new manufacturing techniques in England led many people to be able to afford goods that they could not afford before. These \u2018consumer goods\u2019 were particularly valuable to children, who could afford new books, clothing, and toys. These new manufactured goods made children in Britain happier and, in turn, made their parents more satisfied and less stressed because they could now afford them. As a result, children came to be viewed with less suspicion by the government and society, and children who were poor were less likely to be abused. These changes led to a decline in domestic violence towards children, and more children were brought up to see their parents as heroes rather than as criminals.","token_len":646,"entropy":[10.8798,0.7223,5.6392,0.2134,7.3639,3.894,0.1615,1.7766,5.3341,0.013,2.069,3.5873,1.2714,7.4527,3.8279,0.1744,4.2366,16.7627,7.8768,7.3685,5.2799,5.0675,2.1766,0.826,3.7914,4.1216,5.2587,2.4403,3.4786,0.0374,0.2289,8.3728,5.0884,4.1445,0.6048,0.1927,5.9467,4.712,1.468,5.086,5.4896,0.524,4.0123,1.3908,2.4277,2.2785,0.0277,1.1627,2.535,1.7685,0.0086,1.5938,2.3492,6.0862,0.102,4.4459,3.706,1.1806,5.0059,6.9541,2.2255,3.9023,6.587,6.3634,5.6554,1.5205,2.1169,2.2329,2.461,5.6567,0.0007,7.5439,9.2775,1.349,4.207,2.0528,4.3193,1.1995,3.2939,0.9664,5.0067,2.166,1.3539,5.5797,3.8138,11.5135,3.5555,1.541,2.1262,3.1163,3.9407,0.5619,4.2119,4.5521,3.8066,2.1283,1.0303,4.7023,4.3236,3.7084,3.3428,0.6596,0.3572,3.3295,4.6313,0.4456,4.1612,1.7483,5.677,0.1472,2.7288,4.7777,0.3393,5.7643,2.3839,5.8355,1.4268,0.3326,0.9547,1.7936,7.4403,2.7924,3.0733,1.154,4.8673,3.2124,0.4155,1.7552,5.7682,1.9239,7.4442,0.8864,1.4365,8.7983,10.0309,0.2194,2.7203,4.1129,1.2178,0.0283,1.2637,5.1874,1.0744,3.6301,2.5506,0.1979,3.6949,1.1514,5.7398,1.5528,5.5207,2.8471,2.4392,4.0181,2.154,6.9806,2.7575,1.4106,5.1047,1.5227,5.0156,0.9686,5.9994,2.4296,4.1947,0.2712,2.9061,3.2345,3.3844,1.3389,1.6278,4.3701,0.7058,5.5885,4.5691,0.7329,0.0024,2.1977,6.8003,8.2811,0.7829,2.596,4.3984,0.3882,0.7065,5.0021,0.763,4.2012,4.8074,7.2432,0.0403,1.373,0.2153,2.3808,1.6066,4.3282,0.0052,0.1304,0.5706,1.7359,16.9425,8.9476,3.0146,4.9442,5.6348,9.747,0.0262,3.122,4.2095,2.5143,3.4272,2.2452,2.5444,4.7319,2.3084,0.7477,1.6116,2.5542,0.8192,3.2549,0.0265,1.56,4.4181,0.1046,1.9461,2.7706,3.5558,2.4226,6.4049,0.0123,0.829,6.1575,0.3682,1.1261,5.8498,3.6881,0.1138,1.0143,4.6354,6.1776,1.3784,1.9655,5.9767,3.1155,4.0187,1.6531,4.5784,0.7313,0.1675,1.403,3.983,3.9276,2.4042,2.0814,3.7269,4.1853,1.1492,4.5507,1.8585,0.8223,3.8274,0.3487,2.1723,5.4279,0.0195,3.2138,0.6233,1.1708,0.8675,3.7894,1.6378,0.3847,1.7377,1.8371,2.3233,0.7346,2.4801,5.3559,2.18,4.4796,1.2001,0.214,6.968,1.8221,6.0156,0.566,2.8346,4.565,6.9572,3.1967,2.2921,1.9356,4.4271,6.2644,0.8276,4.3417,4.972,0.7774,4.3316,0.7078,1.4049,4.81,0.4334,3.0871,5.6085,4.9249,9.5917,5.5754,2.0368,0.1345,7.2747,1.4721,2.6049,1.493,0.8399,4.3519,3.0701,1.1303,6.4452,1.5841,3.2797,9.3168,5.5787,1.6182,3.4545,4.8814,0.6067,1.0427,4.18,0.03,4.1021,7.6355,4.3992,7.5806,1.6761,5.2244,1.944,0.5069,1.9181,2.4809,4.695,1.3501,5.507,2.7316,0.9868,5.5049,3.9574,3.4107,0.3272,3.2613,0.2865,1.3324,3.2475,1.3557,1.4038,0.1796,4.4378,2.3874,1.619,1.0972,1.9363,0.1948,0.8432,2.69,0.1418,3.5056,4.7675,2.646,1.8744,2.6849,6.0345,1.5397,4.9445,1.7248,3.4419,4.3738,3.0743,0.6851,1.068,4.7519,0.0008,7.3357,0.6099,3.1106,1.0828,1.5055,4.4102,0.1492,2.5615,3.6202,5.5545,0.2596,0.8307,1.9611,1.0619,4.3397,0.0143,2.7292,3.8936,3.8173,2.4758,0.0208,0.5256,3.5627,2.9095,0.2514,1.6565,4.656,2.2975,0.0265,3.2706,4.2378,4.3115,0.2905,0.9965,0.0076,0.5454,4.1976,3.5477,4.9196,0.0592,0.3867,5.5406,0.2838,1.0954,1.3114,3.9315,6.1573,0.1027,5.0176,6.1214,0.7975,0.4265,0.9327,2.6466,2.9279,3.8733,11.5255,0.0555,0.811,4.4762,1.7799,2.0007,1.3177,5.0804,0.1216,0.5182,6.8733,0.8991,2.4595,5.5125,6.6805,1.1924,5.1742,5.409,2.1068,4.7373,0.1076,5.2127,0.3994,1.7774,2.9887,1.1584,2.0855,1.1259,3.7217,0.806,2.9773,1.0791,4.5395,0.0177,1.3078,5.8912,0.7263,0.0498,5.171,0.8854,0.9869,0.2775,1.4198,6.6748,2.5719,4.8338,0.1513,4.0407,0.9075,0.6603,0.5365,1.423,1.726,1.2455,0.0148,4.4691,2.4448,2.744,0.573,0.0619,1.3021,3.1981,0.0765,4.4948,3.0309,0.0064,0.1138,0.3737,2.0514,6.3471,3.3665,0.1364,6.2128,5.023,6.4075,5.5313,6.188,2.3,4.3939,3.5422,2.398,3.4777,1.9104,0.161,3.9432,4.6493,0.0063,1.3157,5.8555,1.9068,1.7893,0.9626,0.7396,0.3887,4.0025,0.513,3.9024,13.9125,5.0441,6.4455,0.6225,2.7381,2.0348,1.5371,4.894,2.7197,1.5443,5.8079,1.4287,1.5347,2.9194,1.7106,5.3978,4.9843,1.1213,3.0184,0.8817,1.5223,1.8599,0.8954,3.5714,2.5353,5.2513,0.1981,3.4225,2.5695,4.8585,1.6077,5.7457,0.9104,5.0591,1.3908,0.2502,0.0011,2.3035,2.8301,1.7587,1.7688,3.5706,2.1507,3.0467,1.6523,6.0696,0.769,1.9443,5.1915,1.2713,2.9512,0.5051,3.6761,1.4472,0.1272,0.2269,1.3065,5.0801,0.5031,2.6173,4.3329,2.5613,3.6859,1.5188,2.7732,1.9909,2.7922,1.1807,3.4374,2.0107,0.9953,3.0966,2.7953,1.4302,4.193,1.9188,2.3396,0.1365,0.0088,1.0873,5.3482,1.3026,4.3427,1.868,2.4504,0.1337,1.0076,3.2686,0.0495,5.6764,1.2894,7.31,0.6844,1.1947,1.221,4.1681,1.5205,1.4369,4.6878,0.4888,3.017,6.2511,0.6953,0.9479,0.5031,4.6644,3.7885,0.0049,2.3533,1.8239,0.1974]}

In IGN's `` Best of 2005 ``, the game was recognized for `` Best Music Game ``, `` Best PlayStation 2 Music Game ``, and `` Best Music Game of the Year``. The PlayStation 2 edition of Guitar Hero won the PlayStation 2 Award of Excellence. It also received the \"Best Audio in Game Award\" at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The Game Boy Advance edition of Guitar Hero received a \"Game of the Year\" Award at the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was also ranked #7 in the \"Top 250 Games of the 21ST Century\" list, put together by GameSpot's staff of editors, columnists and writers and voted by its readers. Guitar Hero received the Game of the Year award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards\nIn October 2011, Guitar Hero was named the #1 selling video game in the history of the Wii and was the most popular game in November. In February 2012, Guitar Hero was named Billboard's \"Best Video Game of 2011\" in their annual poll of thousands of music readers.\n\nPopularity\n\nA June 2005 poll carried out by MTV, MTV Games & Play and Gamasutra had 60 respondents split between their choices of Guitar Hero and Rock Band with Guitar Hero being picked as the most popular, followed by Rock-Band. Guitar Hero was also the best-selling single of all time according to Nielsen Music (the only poll to date that covers the sales of all music in general in the US).\nThis success has been reflected in other surveys of the video game industry, where Guitar Hero has been cited as one of the game's biggest hits. In a June 2008 survey of the UK video game industry, Guitar Hero was ranked in the top five most popular games of the year, ahead of both Rock Band and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. In a 2005 survey of the top five games, conducted by GameSpy, Guitar Hero came in third, only beaten by Rock Band and the third installment of Resident Evil. In the same year, Guitar Hero was listed as the highest-paid game on a website, beating out both FIFA and Call of Duty.\nThe main compettion for Guitar Hero is that of Playstation 2's rock-'n'-roll game Rock Band, created by the American game developer Harmonix. While Guitar Hero has enjoyed overwhelming popularity, the Rock Band franchise, including its gameplay modes and music, has grown to be more diverse and is regularly cited by music producers and companies as a valuable marketing tool, and was rated number 3 in the American Music Awards of 2010 and number 3 in the People's Choice Awards of 2011. In October 2011, Playstation 3 released Guitar Hero Live, a collection of songs and game modes released on multiple home consoles.

Julia Domna , who was","text":"Following the death of Caracalla, Macrinus allowed Caracalla's mother, Julia Domna, and his aunt Julia Maesa, to settle in their home town of Emesa. Julia Domna, who was also known as Julia Maesa, was a former ruler of Alexandria, whose title of regina was abolished by Emperor Aurelian some time after her coronation. After Macrinus left office, he was succeeded, first, by Otho and then by Maximinus.\nMaximus, born in 191 and elected emperor on 1 July 235, was an unimpressive young man whose rule was marked by a disdain for the arts, while he was also known to be harsh and tyrannical. He was succeeded by Gallienus or Theodotus ( 241-255 ), who gained the respect of the Romans but was also known to be cruel.\nFrom Aetius to Gordian III\nShortly after Gordian III's accession in 251, Aetius became one of the leading men in Rome, an influential tribune, and a governor of the provincials. In 254 Gordian II appointed him consul for the second time, and in 258 he was again appointed consul, but he was subsequently exiled by Gordian III.\nIn 263-64 he attempted an unpopular expedition against the Persians, but this attempt was unsuccessful, and he was exiled in 270. In 266 he successfully opposed the persecution of Christians and was an ally with Emperor Constantine I. He is best known today for his support of Aurelian against Valens, but this support was never formalized ; neither had Aetius any part in the death of the Emperor Valens by suicide.\nIn the early years of Aurelian and Valerian, Aetius was able to influence the administration of affairs. He was made co-emperor in 268, and soon became an influential member of Valerian's council of government. His influence increased in the period between 274 and 283 when Gordian II and Maximinus were Emperor, and he played an important role in the establishment of Aurelian's reign as well as in several of his later campaigns.\nAetius also remained an influential figure in the political scene after the death of Aurelian in 283. One of the most serious problems in 285 was the threat of the Goths in the southwestern provinces. Aetius did all he could to help secure peace at home, but in 286 Valerian lost his mind against Aurelian, and Aetius was forced to flee Rome. The last years of his life were a period of turmoil following his failure to defeat the Goths.

{"prompt":"After the 2000 Sydney Games , a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold @ - @ medal winning Spanish basketball intellectually disabled ( ID ) team were not disabled . He","text":"After the 2000 Sydney Games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold @ - @ medal winning Spanish basketball intellectually disabled ( ID ) team were not disabled. He said that several players on the elite team were more likely to have learning disabilities than what was defined by the organization, and that they were actually not mentally dysfunctional as was previously assumed. He also claimed all the players on that team were receiving special treatment by the team physician.\nThis revelation was confirmed in a document, with the identity of the disabled athletes concealed, which was sent by the Spanish government to different European Olympic Committees. Even though the document was redacted and anonymized, it was later leaked to the British newspaper, Daily Express.\nThe revelation was made public after an interview the former assistant coach of the group, Juan Carlos Monedero, which was later published in El Confidencial.\nMonedero was able to identify 10 of the players involved in the scandal. He said that although the athletes were not formally declared disabled on the National Team Registry, they received disabled status by a physician in order to take part in the games. He also claimed that one of the athletes had a real and serious learning disability. After knowing the allegations, the Spanish government investigated whether disabled athletes received preferential treatment for the games. The findings of the investigation included the fact that none of the athletes received any support and that several of them did not even know the rules. The document was sent to each of the International Olympic Committees ( IOC ), requesting it be analyzed. The IOC ruled that a formal investigation of the allegations would not be possible because the Spanish government would not deliver the document without concealing its identity.\nWhen the Spanish government demanded that all the information be delivered, they claimed that the document was not sent to the IOC or to another sports authority. After the revelations were made public, the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) demanded that an independent investigation be carried out by the International Committee, after the official investigation that Spain carried out found that the data concerning disability were wrong. The report has been submitted to the Board of Trustees of the IPC, who will take a decision.\nDisability Rights Movement\nFollowing the revelations concerning the use of improper measures to increase the number of disabled Olympic athletes and the alleged discrimination in the games, some disability rights activists went to the Spanish National Olympic Council ( CNOS ), where several people protested on behalf of Deaf and hearing impaired athletes. They called on the Council to provide full support to Deaf and hearing impaired athletes and to provide full information on the procedures carried out to obtain information about disability and the treatment they receive, to guarantee the application of international standards.\nIn 2013, as a result of the public disclosure of some examples of institutional manipulation of disabled athletes, the Spanish disability rights organization Plena Inclusion demanded a full report of that issue, together with other issues related to disability. In 2014, the Spanish Congress voted to start a full investigation of the use of measures for the increase of the presence of disabled athletes in the games. In addition, a law was passed, in October, 2014, requesting all disability organizations to submit a report on discrimination against disabled athletes before the International Paralympic Committee.","token_len":650,"entropy":[2.3183,8.579,7.4693,3.3777,0.4648,4.0452,8.1347,5.926,1.8748,8.078,0.7359,6.5268,3.6325,0.013,1.0365,9.0719,13.3311,9.4971,3.8434,8.3083,3.2129,4.424,2.7768,20.4655,2.8221,4.7894,13.7794,3.1981,1.1019,1.5905,5.3775,8.4833,1.8411,3.2114,3.3481,1.4303,5.4152,2.4663,3.6702,0.3674,7.9454,1.2211,1.3694,5.8528,2.4955,0.1394,1.7345,6.5012,0.2194,1.4125,7.5513,1.4745,6.4943,1.3405,0.6948,7.2783,2.7249,1.4407,0.8346,2.5818,1.02,6.3586,4.455,4.619,10.8573,4.3878,3.198,3.9562,3.1634,0.2122,2.6156,1.3038,1.8101,7.9528,1.6685,1.5419,1.6083,3.0768,0.4285,0.6364,7.4277,4.2477,1.2785,4.8297,0.7216,3.2839,3.278,1.1949,1.4149,6.4268,6.1579,2.2509,3.2013,2.2712,1.6357,5.5746,4.8331,6.1756,1.1654,8.1184,0.1672,0.4277,7.8462,2.3186,8.903,1.7549,2.0919,1.1706,3.0122,2.8641,1.1309,2.3244,3.6439,0.6284,9.1964,5.184,4.7057,2.0252,1.2056,6.8119,1.0074,0.9683,2.0356,1.3626,4.2656,3.2139,8.9902,0.198,0.6346,1.2746,1.4116,4.0404,4.62,0.6691,0.9472,4.4037,2.2002,2.9802,3.2382,3.0902,0.9725,1.0596,1.6715,5.0489,2.3232,2.0765,1.9786,2.4329,3.351,3.4509,4.9598,3.3693,5.4013,1.3339,0.8106,1.1367,7.1312,1.4196,3.7276,1.7617,6.3329,8.6207,3.4782,0.376,5.3786,1.6438,4.1004,2.3986,0.9727,4.8323,6.4852,0.5297,0.0039,1.0939,1.2371,3.729,0.0087,0.0041,1.8892,6.4125,0.0095,4.2235,5.24,1.4179,0.1625,3.0903,4.0844,0.4089,0.287,4.7395,1.7074,1.5386,1.4885,0.7502,5.3187,1.572,2.528,1.0031,1.6702,5.9153,5.7186,0.9371,4.8451,0.6859,7.4698,2.3023,9.1301,0.3985,0.945,4.5653,8.222,2.6974,3.7917,3.7283,4.4811,2.2074,4.5622,0.0222,4.9462,0.7965,0.0173,0.8269,3.2152,0.3673,1.7407,1.5293,1.6409,0.2434,3.2688,0.4298,0.1352,1.0424,1.962,2.0184,7.5259,5.3955,3.4051,3.5782,0.0919,0.8753,5.6413,8.1556,1.8644,6.1737,1.2662,1.6291,2.0353,0.7373,6.073,5.1096,11.233,0.2406,3.9857,3.7091,0.0185,3.6521,2.2113,1.78,0.6059,2.4097,6.5404,1.5031,0.356,0.3349,5.2228,2.0667,3.1016,0.0154,4.0573,0.0928,0.0706,0.9681,2.1123,1.7789,5.4347,3.9218,1.9615,5.3989,1.085,1.0128,3.2039,0.1875,2.51,2.1843,1.9147,3.9273,1.6983,2.4909,4.8498,1.8102,3.6221,0.2853,5.6714,0.9311,0.1167,5.8877,0.1937,3.7835,1.6799,3.5351,1.5939,6.2441,3.2444,0.4219,6.1956,1.3273,1.721,2.0253,5.975,0.5494,4.3466,5.1251,1.0437,2.1979,0.3626,1.4577,2.3253,1.1687,0.5205,1.8166,2.3363,1.1643,4.4484,0.4799,2.8963,0.7736,8.6046,1.0086,1.5164,4.624,12.4165,0.0022,3.1459,0.8699,0.2511,0.5364,4.9688,1.2003,1.6413,0.422,5.0419,1.3822,3.4633,0.7185,5.2198,1.7133,5.7763,2.0821,2.7035,5.1362,0.3709,1.2167,3.0398,0.7394,2.1468,4.5429,0.7022,0.6922,2.0324,3.0285,1.7263,5.3258,5.8406,4.2566,0.8302,4.2267,1.3229,4.4769,2.2951,0.991,0.1007,0.1204,0.8115,6.2273,3.6129,0.0051,0.1575,0.0327,0.6361,2.3976,0.2916,0.3112,3.8385,0.4023,5.4415,1.0958,1.3802,0.1941,1.9001,0.0123,2.7663,0.5042,2.4985,3.0496,7.7704,5.2918,2.7802,5.9773,1.4129,5.7111,8.7443,4.7093,0.0056,3.8579,0.8205,1.0133,5.6446,5.9784,6.8846,2.5606,6.1165,0.3636,1.5725,4.2006,4.8037,1.0069,4.0158,0.1489,0.2185,6.3226,0.0834,4.5247,0.0012,0.7262,0.2634,1.7121,0.0053,1.9074,3.0762,1.7934,4.2125,2.602,0.5991,3.4864,0.5244,7.6822,1.3044,4.8842,5.2611,1.2205,5.6379,0.2787,2.1601,4.5989,0.4574,6.1,0.0244,7.7744,4.8526,1.2104,5.5447,0.9234,1.4551,0.0457,1.2337,4.8643,0.4764,3.5151,2.0112,5.3711,4.5885,2.664,0.8675,1.7466,0.2256,4.0021,4.7258,0.2093,0.9982,5.9821,1.1038,1.0048,3.3515,5.2449,0.7953,4.4159,0.836,4.3416,5.4464,1.0133,2.6331,4.7314,4.5878,6.1449,4.0579,2.2952,0.0029,9.4498,3.3956,1.9822,5.1983,1.9767,0.5269,0.4869,2.494,3.7352,1.0351,0.4139,3.9837,0.135,4.2002,4.6801,3.0613,0.6811,2.6853,0.0002,1.4921,0.152,0.2004,0.0873,2.091,1.1609,2.3715,3.9507,2.8844,1.5034,0.7369,3.9867,7.4866,0.0122,1.8178,4.5754,3.7266,1.2042,3.2354,2.5182,1.9826,3.8544,1.6156,0.4027,3.365,3.4122,6.5304,1.9742,7.8053,0.2318,5.7232,1.4372,2.0357,0.6403,2.5428,5.3449,0.2283,5.5314,2.2237,0.6999,0.0116,0.6612,5.2187,5.8706,0.3948,5.085,8.3069,0.1272,6.2983,6.8693,1.6703,1.4972,0.0885,0.5574,0.7162,2.1305,8.8738,0.3952,2.9024,8.0592,5.3129,6.4471,3.5896,5.2874,2.9708,1.812,3.5576,2.8152,6.5457,3.5069,1.9255,5.1837,0.0006,4.4781,2.7158,1.6971,0.0134,2.6817,1.7962,2.6786,2.5239,0.1468,0.7352,1.1857,7.7878,4.5463,0.4224,7.0983,0.7806,4.4194,0.9317,1.6229,0.3946,3.9956,0.0262,4.8833,4.5357,1.2839,4.828,0.7677,0.8302,8.6596,0.0832,0.7396,0.0768,0.7654,0.3513,1.0434,0.4757,2.7352,2.7709,0.2594,3.0445,5.0201,0.8241,0.3921,3.3803,3.4957,4.4409,1.8971,3.6908,0.2075,7.7989,4.1146,4.3281,4.5004,0.8948,3.1464,1.8016,0.7597,1.2214,6.2005,1.9567,0.8905,0.1233,6.4151,0.5941,4.4021,0.856,0.0003,0.0641,0.0559,1.4769]}
{"prompt":"A problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years : although we start with the assumption of three basic `` simple `` actions , the rules of the game say that if we","text":"A problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years : although we start with the assumption of three basic `` simple `` actions, the rules of the game say that if we start with the assumption of two basic simple actions then every time the first player decides that she prefers either playing A1 or A2 then there is no need to play `` simple ``, the opponent can play `` simple ``, even if she had not, and in this case the game should have a different name.\nLet us see how and when this phenomenon can be observed. It is usually said that there is a '' game where it is always better '' to play `` simple ''.\nThe game is called '' the game of chicken '' because after each play, the players may observe if the other is still alive and will play again.\nThe game is played among two players and the rules are that there are two birds in the box and one player ( usually called `` chick '') takes the box as if it is a box of eggs and takes one of the birds ; the other player (usually called the '' player '' of chicks, or chicken of the box ) moves the other bird and the winner is the player who has done better.\nIn the previous chapter we saw that given a game G of players, the strategies are precisely the subsets of actions X such that \\ G \\ X= X.\nSo if you try to calculate \\ G \\ X= X, you calculate precisely the set of strategies of the game G. So a game is uniquely determined by its strategies!\nSo if we try to define a game by specifying a set of strategies ( X ) ( such as `` the king of Sicily '' ), that is to say by specifying all the legal bets on the game, we will soon see that this is not enough. This definition is not unique :\nand every game that we can define this way corresponds to a game that we will be able to define uniquely by specifying the set of strategies \\ G \\ X= X.\nIn other words, we can say that a game is uniquely determined by this set of strategies, what can be expressed by saying that \\ G \\ X= X represents a game exactly like that described by the previous definition.\nOne of the problems of the game of chess is that it is possible and even very often to consider a player as playing not only with one but with two pieces.\nSo in the game of chess it is possible to consider such a player playing with two pieces of white and two pieces of black.\nIn some other games it is possible that two players do not only play against each other but have two pieces against either each other or no pieces.\nFor example, in the game of checkers there can be six players playing with no pieces or one player playing against 6 others with no pieces or one player playing against only 4 others with a piece.\nAlso in the game of go it is possible to place some players against others by their side with no pieces or as the king's opponent with no pieces.\nSo in games like chess and go, which are quite rich and rich, it was quite natural to consider each action as taking place by two different players.","token_len":650,"entropy":[8.6369,6.2722,11.1044,6.2252,7.1678,4.3395,8.558,2.8283,7.06,0.7459,8.2006,6.2989,4.055,8.7902,1.7474,1.2097,5.0016,2.0403,6.5071,5.4199,12.6983,11.4553,3.8787,6.7419,1.6679,2.2739,7.0908,0.9506,1.6646,1.482,6.5547,0.9776,3.495,1.7503,4.2236,0.7221,1.8434,4.0335,0.7519,2.435,2.0704,7.3182,0.2024,3.9585,5.0153,3.4127,2.3616,2.6963,7.328,5.3678,3.3047,5.5401,6.6832,5.103,7.6776,7.1942,6.8384,0.1884,0.8641,0.1409,2.4841,3.8177,0.8083,1.234,2.3505,0.4822,1.7803,6.3572,3.6163,0.2138,4.6887,3.2716,6.7834,2.7836,2.4222,2.4401,0.5547,0.087,2.8145,3.4684,0.3662,1.0427,4.5076,3.2219,6.0045,1.9421,4.0802,2.0634,0.3667,1.7005,2.4541,4.8364,2.9126,3.1744,4.2404,5.9596,0.8644,2.5378,8.5834,0.5558,3.433,1.2025,6.4981,2.252,1.6348,7.0744,2.5565,0.9091,3.9341,0.7699,4.1633,0.7157,5.0513,4.1162,0.2465,3.9712,0.7397,0.9181,4.8352,4.8538,4.0976,4.4559,0.2476,3.9398,3.7088,7.8737,0.4469,0.6134,2.2423,0.179,7.5429,5.6592,2.9267,2.3065,2.812,1.6779,2.2007,2.4978,3.5073,1.7444,0.2588,7.7647,4.586,2.0382,5.7991,3.8005,3.4732,1.7616,1.0054,3.5062,4.9147,6.7066,5.1129,1.5221,2.8742,4.554,4.5794,3.4088,2.1225,5.204,2.5563,4.0834,1.1686,1.6845,1.7581,1.5289,1.1835,2.7258,7.0304,2.4235,2.2589,2.8476,2.0268,3.3007,1.3232,3.6259,4.1179,1.2825,1.1199,7.5242,2.157,0.6995,4.8571,1.8299,1.7087,2.917,5.4759,9.1544,4.0929,2.3634,7.6845,2.1664,2.1309,4.4589,1.1085,3.5349,4.5856,4.6864,0.4412,3.5017,1.0858,4.0153,2.0772,2.7552,1.2364,3.9324,2.7816,1.021,0.3003,2.8075,7.8584,1.3979,0.4887,0.4901,1.5021,2.5175,0.0741,5.5106,2.5651,3.9077,0.8232,6.1938,9.5021,2.9893,2.7289,5.5135,4.5514,1.2882,2.2438,2.2899,4.9071,1.0261,4.2026,1.9042,3.0457,1.8283,5.4944,2.5138,1.697,2.6887,0.5585,1.8467,6.1245,3.7634,1.2951,0.7742,2.4286,1.1808,4.7371,2.3504,1.1848,1.907,0.5248,7.8816,1.6582,2.8997,11.8311,4.5765,5.8647,1.8839,1.7633,9.3265,1.8612,7.9478,0.7316,14.6512,0.4872,0.2541,4.2795,7.174,7.6613,0.2344,7.9906,8.5773,2.4509,5.5567,4.9157,3.5244,2.52,1.6283,3.7551,2.4391,3.1103,4.0677,0.2464,6.2685,5.0753,0.6724,0.645,0.1516,1.885,0.9221,1.2771,0.9236,7.7038,8.5052,1.2091,5.0228,0.1484,4.8605,2.2623,1.0773,0.39,2.7696,1.3755,3.8007,4.4424,1.6861,2.2733,9.4631,3.1532,0.7568,2.1734,2.9439,7.1033,0.7667,2.9545,2.2384,1.8882,3.4956,0.0857,4.6835,1.4388,1.159,3.6044,6.803,1.6813,1.1198,0.0401,1.2845,3.6785,4.677,1.9593,5.0625,5.9652,2.2596,5.3546,5.0082,8.0078,1.4997,9.0927,3.4054,2.3715,4.0011,0.8799,2.0827,0.0094,3.0388,2.3888,4.0509,0.8894,8.1734,7.3993,2.1621,1.0922,1.7612,1.4047,1.374,2.4372,6.2979,1.9302,0.4483,3.2629,1.3167,1.2916,3.5959,0.7966,4.2942,6.598,1.3994,2.1413,6.3717,4.8233,4.2452,6.6295,5.1367,1.8933,3.8173,2.1274,3.5421,3.0728,6.2249,1.2824,6.8108,0.2149,1.2544,0.6721,2.2386,1.9669,3.9367,2.8187,2.7093,0.015,2.4652,7.8423,1.9672,2.9921,1.7719,3.1714,0.0363,0.4723,5.4511,0.6768,0.6116,0.1279,1.1309,0.5321,0.8665,0.4635,2.8405,2.1601,0.0065,0.3329,1.8937,1.3488,3.1448,0.404,2.009,0.2844,0.9765,1.5013,0.2754,0.1672,6.0121,1.3146,0.0694,0.7409,1.9569,6.7468,4.42,0.8564,6.7305,1.6157,4.9853,0.2733,4.4234,0.2389,0.0659,0.0483,0.1208,0.394,7.6625,1.5769,1.3322,7.2699,1.649,3.257,3.1367,1.251,0.8142,2.9334,3.8165,0.8846,0.5565,4.8626,2.1516,0.0731,2.2865,2.4074,1.6513,1.1796,0.8655,3.8052,0.4227,0.3855,1.5877,0.6269,4.8607,6.4842,3.8504,5.5065,3.8342,6.5439,6.7718,2.4029,5.2862,2.3691,2.8887,6.6947,1.2547,4.6616,2.1926,5.141,0.7891,1.5038,3.5616,1.3263,1.953,3.092,2.9944,1.3859,2.1921,0.0837,0.1472,3.1276,0.1862,1.707,0.4026,3.2165,4.9191,0.5818,0.7835,3.5139,1.5176,0.9876,0.2134,3.3249,4.9133,1.6052,1.4881,0.3875,0.0295,0.4586,0.9895,1.2894,2.2652,5.0121,4.2541,2.5499,2.3325,0.2081,0.6144,4.0249,4.1612,1.7031,5.2105,0.5736,5.5775,0.7557,3.6404,0.706,0.0089,0.7443,4.9499,4.1505,2.7344,4.7274,6.6729,3.6546,0.0404,1.1922,7.5211,4.7816,1.8942,0.548,3.7625,0.4035,0.5037,1.1946,1.1428,0.9101,0.052,7.5368,0.8123,3.1334,4.3469,0.0755,6.4654,1.2828,2.4787,3.1725,4.4542,1.4313,3.5957,3.0,0.5276,0.683,1.9234,7.8968,5.9637,2.868,1.3249,0.1327,2.9042,1.0486,0.1469,0.1673,0.1079,4.1366,3.179,0.4355,0.7327,3.8875,0.8596,0.8679,0.3731,6.4321,1.4416,1.1127,0.1651,0.0161,8.1526,4.8072,0.1647,0.0841,0.4283,6.0207,4.7634,3.9101,3.2768,4.2542,3.6556,5.5253,6.8794,4.7853,1.5973,0.3843,1.3704,6.14,3.4049,5.2473,5.084,4.7438,2.6546,0.8267,0.0784,0.5833,0.1991,2.6209,1.3915,5.9838,2.3592,0.7885,3.7448,4.7687,1.12,5.914,1.0389,4.2639,7.5816,2.8843,4.6629,1.6919,1.9703,5.7239,3.8032,3.1418,0.672,2.1844,4.7661,7.7144,1.1834,5.0597,0.6858,4.7082,3.1157,2.9135,0.7554,1.0006]}

'' - in a club by Henry Irving. He would go on to star in three pantomimes written specifically for him including, most famously, The Magic Flute ( 1890 ) and Cinderella ( 1892 ). He also starred in the pantomime Little Dog and the Fox ( 1894 ) at the Prince of Wales Theatre with Annie Daly and was the composer of the music to, among others, The Three Musketeers and The Fairy Godmother.\nHe also appeared in a number of other pantomimes during his career including, among others, The Night on Bald Mountain, The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1895 ) in which he played Robin Hood's father and his final pantomime The Snow Maiden ( 1911 ).\nHis final London appearance was as Prince Hans in The Snow Maiden in 1908. Following this he made his last appearance, in pantomime, at Birminghams Palace Theatre as Prince George in The Night on Bald Mountain in 1917 and thereafter became a keen theatre actor.\nDick Whittington is perhaps his finest pantomime character. In 1893 he played the role to great success at a pantomime given by Dick Whittington's great-grandson at the National Theatre in London. This was the first and only pantomime that Whittington wrote and this in turn led to his appearing in his own pantomime the following year, although he appears to have suffered a breakdown in the production due to his own stress at not being able to deliver as the role had been written for someone else.\nThis would bring a brief hiatus between his career as a composer and one as an actor that would continue until 1913 with the premiere of his best known character, Puck, in Cinderella at Wembley Stadium. He would also appear in a Christmas pantomime that he and his wife had written at Hampstead Theatre in 1906.\nHis last appearance at the age of 84 was as the Tinkerbell in Alice's Adventures under Ground in 1915. After this he became an active theatre-goer, taking on roles to fund a pantomime at the West End theatre Belasco's Playhouse, and also appeared in a pantomime performance, This Man of Many Parts, at the Adelphi Theatre in New York as an elderly friend of his.\nIn later life he returned in time for a pantomime at the Gaiety Theatre, which was directed by his son Harold who played King Henry and also his son, Albert who played Prince Edward's Ghost.\nHe died at Lutterworth, Essex, on 3 June 1944 at the age of 98 although his funeral was attended not only by his family but also many of the musical fraternity. An obituary in musical life described him as being \" a real classical gentleman of the old school \" and the following year added that although his family had found a little comfort in his death, they had yet to come to terms with this new loss.","token_len":651,"entropy":[10.7205,2.6399,4.7189,10.7788,4.668,2.508,11.0811,2.6766,0.0658,1.8764,2.61,10.835,4.8394,8.8024,1.441,7.7791,3.8975,0.7841,0.0787,0.0055,0.0016,1.7193,2.5375,2.7265,3.0167,2.3777,3.4764,0.2881,9.5594,1.0884,0.876,7.1128,2.3384,5.6553,2.251,6.5759,4.4557,11.6302,13.9055,1.9964,1.7222,5.1171,4.5936,5.6254,1.2508,6.2816,5.5916,1.2352,1.6649,2.794,4.6517,2.6741,5.7839,3.4651,2.053,7.3915,5.9532,6.3969,7.1154,1.2466,2.3684,4.2161,2.608,0.0659,0.0848,3.4667,0.2155,4.5036,7.3593,0.0131,0.6807,8.7293,7.5768,0.0771,2.2264,5.332,3.8811,3.9172,1.51,0.2323,2.4846,6.0108,3.4296,0.3276,2.8494,9.3809,2.2627,0.6795,8.2527,0.928,2.0666,1.5264,0.7431,2.044,1.5253,2.8217,0.2489,1.6382,6.9461,0.0141,0.118,5.6114,7.5598,2.4892,1.7531,5.0245,1.6587,2.1702,0.9658,0.9548,4.6957,1.1082,6.6845,1.7729,0.0145,1.156,5.4069,6.2569,11.5084,1.6435,4.7745,2.8548,6.5111,0.8156,1.2064,4.646,4.1245,6.8176,1.6303,0.3465,0.0329,1.8807,5.4215,0.9585,0.1028,0.0004,2.3071,1.5123,6.1014,4.0773,0.0416,1.9338,2.0917,6.7997,2.1514,1.8101,0.3463,2.1405,1.7979,0.0168,2.6984,1.7486,0.0047,0.2832,4.5795,0.5729,1.445,2.3546,2.3407,3.0908,0.2923,0.105,1.337,5.1553,4.7633,5.7249,0.3213,2.4422,1.3356,6.2144,2.1662,0.015,0.6291,0.3097,0.9016,1.1913,4.4726,8.725,0.0472,4.9756,0.7577,2.2505,4.038,0.6575,4.0727,0.3252,0.2425,1.0518,5.4005,0.5064,2.2097,2.8073,1.8931,2.6086,9.8015,5.3731,0.0223,0.0027,4.7416,5.623,6.6255,1.0788,4.6385,1.2473,1.1891,2.8889,3.6895,5.8825,0.7059,0.3948,0.8819,4.9017,5.9264,1.3116,1.3672,4.088,1.5899,3.5041,4.9634,1.1508,5.723,2.0839,1.5234,3.894,0.8019,3.4415,0.6215,4.7636,1.8352,8.093,0.0025,0.1149,3.7248,4.502,6.6959,10.5365,4.7585,1.6852,4.4092,3.2634,3.1509,1.6683,3.4424,4.1194,0.9397,0.0554,0.0076,1.5909,5.086,3.3695,6.0609,4.5707,1.2508,8.0078,5.2958,4.6583,0.8489,1.2453,9.3959,7.0584,2.1539,0.5704,4.0906,5.0736,5.3248,3.4156,4.5998,0.0029,0.0018,2.977,1.1835,2.5185,7.7541,0.6172,1.4818,1.4684,2.1053,7.5425,5.0607,2.0836,2.951,3.5723,4.4078,0.0098,0.0019,6.4838,1.3574,6.1019,0.6094,0.021,0.0006,4.366,5.6521,1.019,0.7691,1.7012,4.6298,0.8348,5.8608,0.4534,0.9606,1.0146,0.7567,3.6194,1.5105,2.1066,0.9545,5.4485,0.4444,1.2121,0.0027,0.0031,3.3465,3.7611,0.0101,0.0008,6.605,2.2517,6.8682,6.0599,1.8596,2.068,0.2048,1.538,5.7012,0.4876,4.8057,1.5285,1.4344,0.0034,0.05,6.2933,1.7501,0.0659,2.005,5.3164,1.3371,6.2898,2.0912,0.0731,4.9184,1.4094,5.9218,1.1535,2.0198,2.3725,2.4433,0.0073,2.6593,4.6731,6.7521,4.2826,7.6349,0.8147,0.3667,0.0042,5.9418,4.9149,3.9014,3.4983,3.2514,0.7513,3.9233,2.5235,8.7118,0.3175,0.2842,1.2015,4.7958,5.3221,5.5245,4.1403,4.7875,2.1052,3.136,1.199,4.3073,1.3285,0.4546,4.892,0.3183,6.2937,4.9134,2.3389,0.1227,4.5065,1.6399,2.4986,1.4508,7.2946,3.5474,1.4969,6.2569,0.1404,2.3177,4.2847,2.1888,5.5388,0.6681,6.4809,4.8298,1.5925,0.8917,9.3021,4.2916,4.6294,1.1695,1.1844,2.7726,1.8422,1.798,1.6661,0.3603,1.9428,7.1339,2.4759,0.0046,0.0028,3.8202,1.9854,5.3255,0.7389,1.3016,3.2587,2.8892,4.1855,6.8737,0.0993,4.8011,0.8911,5.8103,1.2237,0.9346,3.2021,1.85,2.3851,2.5906,1.7451,6.0693,0.0049,4.8824,0.3499,1.1408,1.8559,9.6837,3.1655,0.8587,5.2925,2.167,0.4376,8.2435,12.3426,5.1979,5.4074,0.6572,4.2899,1.5619,0.7322,3.635,2.3541,4.3811,3.2257,5.7011,2.3577,0.0005,1.9276,4.7522,2.5269,1.5626,5.7868,9.5474,2.6422,5.482,0.0124,0.0027,3.6259,1.0708,5.6892,0.5832,3.4984,11.8749,7.6315,0.3282,3.038,6.0458,0.0664,2.488,2.185,2.8949,4.5087,0.3847,1.6771,1.7689,0.0046,0.002,6.0166,4.3717,6.7699,5.9673,4.7624,4.5791,5.9909,1.0457,1.6995,0.9162,7.9398,1.4935,0.0819,0.3602,0.6929,5.2081,0.3026,5.044,4.4834,4.1466,4.9028,0.6841,2.5798,1.9747,0.7764,2.4746,6.3433,1.9978,0.8669,5.0404,4.3011,4.721,1.0338,1.5737,1.8533,0.0036,0.0015,3.0093,0.9648,10.2954,2.8403,0.7623,1.9758,3.1494,1.7116,6.696,0.0313,3.3002,2.7629,6.401,5.1793,2.72,5.0874,2.4094,5.9644,4.0095,5.2213,1.989,2.4592,5.8697,5.5189,0.731,3.3738,2.2887,5.1484,10.0882,1.0063,1.0807,1.824,2.4361,1.9912,7.2435,8.3315,3.6788,2.3745,3.8265,0.7325,1.0671,4.3704,2.8621,5.2512,2.8743,0.5779,0.0173,0.0078,4.9268,7.4264,1.0101,2.7127,0.8035,2.0873,8.8161,0.9772,0.0574,0.461,2.0409,0.4954,0.5463,3.5423,1.3117,2.2165,5.5331,8.2305,1.6503,6.522,3.4005,0.0067,0.0037,3.337,10.9532,8.4725,3.6483,0.2421,0.062,3.2738,1.0018,4.7244,5.2141,7.4841,3.8059,3.7299,1.776,5.9594,1.6055,4.4097,0.8738,3.492,3.9419,0.503,5.2937,1.3925,5.7491,2.6365,4.0601,1.7829,6.7068,2.1732,5.5993,4.5841,0.2086,0.8237,2.5369,0.7916,1.826,1.7555,4.1747,0.0865,4.701,0.5625,0.2642,0.02,4.9419,4.7376,6.1124,0.5059]}
{"prompt":"The Japan Self @ - @ Defense Forces ( JSDF ) and the Japan Ground Self @ - @ Defense Force use a version of the sun disc design with eight red rays extending outward","text":"The Japan Self @ - @ Defense Forces ( JSDF ) and the Japan Ground Self @ - @ Defense Force use a version of the sun disc design with eight red rays extending outward from the center and a black circle on the disk. The rays point up from the central sun, and appear to shine across the top of the disk. The disk also indicates the three traditional values of Japan: the sacred or peaceful state, the military aspect of the armed forces, and the nation's economic strength.\n\nMilitary\n\nWithin the military there is a separate military version. There is a red sun disc at the center, with two white circles around the sun disc (the two white circles representing the Republic of China), with the Japanese national seal at the bottom (Japan's distinctive seal and the name of the National Defense League for Japan are superimposed on the sun disc). The seal is the most important symbol of the Imperial Family and the Japanese State, as it displays the imperial family and is used during official ceremonies.\nThe military version was originally used on the right of the Japanese tricolor flag, but after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Military Version was removed from the right and the Japanese tricolor was used exclusively as the national flag. However, since 1951, the Military Version has been shown on the left of the national flag and on banners for formal events during celebrations commemorating the Japanese military's victory over the American forces in the Second World War as part of the Allied victory in Europe. The image is also shown on a flag used by the Maritime Self-Defense Force on their vessels.\nDuring Japan's post-war occupation of Korea, military versions of the flag were used to express the support and loyalty of the Japanese population in North Korea to the Japanese imperial family and military forces. This version of the flag was also used prior to the Korean War as a public statement by the Japanese government to encourage its citizens to work together when wartime conditions were difficult.\n\nSymbolism\n\nIn the military version, eight rays (one red and seven white) are depicted radiating from the sun. The Japanese national motto is written in Kanji characters and is translated into English as \"We, the Japanese Imperial Family, are bound by the Great God Shogun, the Sun and Eight Rays\" (Japanese: \u65e5\u7687\u5fa1\u5b87\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u795e\u6b66\u5929\u7687\u3001\u516b\u54ab\u9ce5\u306e\u5fa1\u516b\u8292\u65d7\u3092\u8a93\u3044\u3092\u7acb\u3061). This has come to mean in modern japanese: To defend Japan as honor-bound, and to serve Japan at the highest level.\nThe red rays of the sun represent the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese military and Japan's sovereignty, the white rays represent the Republic of China, the white area represents a blank border between China and Japan, the Sun represents both the Japanese and Chinese emperors and the eight rays represent the eight imperial provinces (\u516b\u90e1) of China. The eight rays represent the eight main components of Japan: Shogun, Shuri, Heiji, Meiji, Tokugawa, Taisho, Showa and Meiji.","token_len":651,"entropy":[9.5654,6.0984,15.4331,7.8006,5.8692,10.2137,4.0782,3.2009,9.5427,1.3103,0.4206,4.3052,2.1772,3.828,7.3869,3.2433,0.8505,0.3107,0.1043,4.3676,3.0583,8.9957,3.1038,6.4898,0.1663,0.9732,10.3768,9.9708,7.7603,3.8776,7.6898,5.9993,6.046,5.897,3.6697,1.1838,0.506,2.0844,3.208,2.8249,3.1091,2.8883,3.1967,0.5391,6.4819,1.0965,1.3142,5.8028,7.0244,4.1095,2.1658,0.3433,4.2224,2.9683,2.4599,2.0881,5.5079,1.3004,4.9259,4.393,0.2964,4.5731,0.3245,0.0955,0.6825,0.8377,1.1122,3.7201,3.8502,6.1025,1.0106,7.0304,9.005,7.915,0.7524,6.3437,2.4099,3.5108,7.9482,5.1317,5.6549,2.6644,1.0402,1.0745,3.4285,8.1368,0.9361,0.8484,5.8452,0.1,0.3858,0.0967,0.4202,5.5498,0.701,4.9026,3.5876,0.2345,1.8189,0.14,6.5004,3.0879,0.0002,7.8917,0.6926,2.4416,3.8776,1.2458,0.8172,5.7828,4.1701,5.1174,3.2788,4.0799,0.9264,1.0036,5.578,2.3724,1.1031,4.3371,0.1988,0.9856,2.0297,2.8046,3.1355,2.5991,3.5891,3.596,1.1657,2.5678,2.5275,4.6519,2.1414,3.3819,1.8882,0.4004,4.7714,0.6902,8.5519,0.4491,3.2497,3.1875,3.6727,2.0573,4.4147,4.5004,7.0576,2.7678,0.1748,2.7338,3.1807,4.158,1.2098,7.2215,2.9539,4.3001,1.2689,5.309,0.4856,0.4866,5.1222,3.0895,5.9133,5.0006,2.3978,3.9263,9.7548,0.0283,0.4453,0.4523,4.3326,0.4269,0.5336,0.9956,5.4621,1.3033,3.0843,4.181,1.8736,1.661,0.4658,0.676,5.251,4.4812,2.0731,1.5802,2.6569,5.8835,1.9558,2.7437,1.5117,6.2158,0.6994,4.7178,2.1885,3.209,3.8119,3.1779,4.7602,4.3567,0.4064,1.24,1.3205,16.2936,3.1886,1.3879,4.5379,3.2343,3.3021,3.5895,1.2615,6.0941,3.1792,0.2617,2.6496,10.0514,0.102,0.1484,1.6624,1.3592,1.6904,3.9716,0.9614,8.4223,0.0146,0.1632,2.6537,4.5213,2.379,0.8009,0.9767,7.0242,3.5013,0.4779,3.4443,1.0934,0.5278,5.0454,3.8325,2.5835,2.694,3.2302,0.0003,0.0264,2.1915,2.5168,5.5672,2.8657,1.0136,2.8368,0.9304,0.7182,3.9073,0.0486,3.5125,6.4564,0.4068,0.7071,3.6385,0.306,0.5806,0.4723,4.5871,1.2156,0.7913,1.922,0.571,0.1125,3.7498,0.6052,2.1496,1.885,7.8588,3.749,8.0047,3.1225,5.1318,5.4349,5.1177,0.0426,0.4881,3.6538,5.0368,1.6978,1.9733,0.6664,0.7228,4.3329,2.2366,0.9605,1.7717,3.0741,0.04,0.0011,6.5975,4.7889,0.0006,0.5178,6.2639,3.2635,1.247,2.6581,0.3702,1.8804,5.4944,2.6241,2.3911,1.9825,0.6574,2.3213,3.3324,4.3456,0.9922,0.4897,8.3977,0.877,1.34,0.0818,0.3336,3.8009,3.2926,4.9065,1.6162,0.5432,19.8275,3.7818,0.1248,5.7117,0.1019,0.7292,2.913,1.0342,2.3755,0.5478,4.838,3.5432,0.6139,0.1725,4.2427,0.6037,1.3479,2.4265,5.049,1.1522,5.4275,2.3875,2.9377,0.1577,0.3891,1.2992,4.3277,2.9005,5.3236,0.3407,4.9879,0.3364,3.0327,3.8859,0.7273,1.9323,3.656,4.0608,0.4086,3.4352,2.7184,1.4224,0.0402,1.1185,0.8838,2.3828,0.524,7.0106,0.0057,0.45,2.0194,0.0559,3.3357,1.0291,6.504,5.2034,3.2921,0.4239,1.5179,0.9043,2.4581,4.4251,3.4734,1.5928,0.1616,5.7953,2.2453,7.0962,6.1388,1.8248,1.1483,2.8018,0.7059,0.9286,0.0003,9.3115,0.2934,0.6212,0.431,0.0002,3.0942,1.2026,2.1924,0.9287,1.0982,7.4896,2.4659,3.354,3.8628,1.8243,1.668,4.5717,0.8844,0.3149,1.2398,4.9705,8.3491,0.0012,1.1539,0.1044,2.9409,1.6603,0.9384,4.7689,2.3887,5.2899,0.833,5.9723,1.4922,8.9153,0.0439,4.8778,2.4581,1.743,3.1046,1.9436,1.1209,0.4112,0.7155,4.0987,4.7317,0.7376,3.0832,7.3297,0.3206,0.5753,2.3241,7.806,2.1358,0.9814,5.6852,5.5765,9.6394,1.725,1.6139,5.0612,2.897,9.5844,1.393,3.2325,0.5162,3.6898,0.8918,2.6508,2.762,0.2067,10.0846,1.2433,5.6076,1.834,5.6114,4.1916,6.7935,2.9854,1.0921,2.0286,2.0543,1.2826,5.3783,5.9618,6.9902,7.0383,0.1097,5.7969,4.3023,2.6869,3.4217,3.1043,7.8268,3.1057,3.6206,0.7869,4.353,3.922,2.0281,3.9106,1.2522,3.5218,4.55,4.5684,5.8655,3.78,3.884,5.1598,3.8059,4.3761,6.4014,5.1952,0.2591,1.4184,3.2418,3.0288,3.0845,5.8301,5.9799,0.3333,2.7322,5.7525,4.7512,7.1036,0.0222,0.0458,3.7349,6.9456,5.1518,2.0464,4.8132,8.9821,3.8545,1.9995,1.2363,2.8996,0.9443,4.1468,3.2194,4.646,1.1501,2.167,0.5689,1.5214,0.9148,15.8527,4.0996,2.4568,2.9642,0.1434,0.8041,4.4095,0.6278,3.3949,3.2714,0.1265,1.4333,1.9707,2.9331,2.4505,2.1192,3.8496,0.2863,6.3982,2.3394,3.3913,7.311,1.2879,0.8444,0.5558,3.7522,0.0844,0.0101,0.6896,1.2347,3.1408,8.9664,1.5255,4.198,7.3574,4.6692,1.6422,1.5982,0.0634,0.4746,0.3339,1.7001,8.7854,1.2618,5.6185,1.2502,2.2604,1.4231,1.2345,6.4099,0.0676,1.8224,0.9791,6.7226,0.7245,0.6633,0.5319,4.6412,5.0889,5.7834,2.6127,5.3033,0.132,6.5007,4.5906,4.3679,1.0705,1.3543,0.6597,1.3803,2.3998,0.3263,1.5275,0.6277,2.4343,4.437,4.71,0.1895,1.8369,2.3319,7.6748,0.4873,5.0158,9.1964,0.2429,5.5246,2.9887,0.2388,4.9416,0.0273,0.2707,4.9166,0.1855,0.001,0.2494,4.8434,0.8707,0.6381,0.2809,10.6327,0.1186,2.093,4.7137,0.3017,0.7041]}
{"prompt":"In 2000 , the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom . Weymouth and Portland 's waters were credited by","text":"In 2000, the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom. Weymouth and Portland's waters were credited by the International Olympic Committee with the setting up of a World Sailing Region in the Bay and subsequent building of the Olympic Fleet Centre as part of the Olympic Village in 2002.\nThe British Army Coast Guard has a base at Roper Bay, under the command of HMS St Albans (the only Coast Guardsman to wear both the United States and British insignia), which also provides lifeboat service to Portland Harbour.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe area is home to a number of large technology companies, including Avago Technologies and Renesas Electronics which is a subsidiary of IBM's. Renesas, formerly known under the name of NXP Semiconductors, was a spin-off from Nokia after Nokia purchased the remainder of the former company for US$8.2 billion in 1996. Since October 2005, Renesas' headquarters have been moved from Finland to nearby Buxton. The area is also home to the company Digicodes, which designs and manufactures digital logic circuits.\nThe area has a high concentration of semiconductor firms, including Texas Instruments, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments, Philips Semiconductors, and Renesas. In 2009, the area became known as Semiconductor Valley. In 2010, IBM acquired a small part of Renesas (approximately 20\u00a0percent) as a part of a larger deal that also included Texas Instruments and some of Texas Instruments' assets. As of 2019, Renesas remains headquartered in Buxton, with the main campus and offices in the same location since its founding in 1955.\n\nFashion\n\nA major fashion retailer, Next, previously had a large store at the corner of Clifton Road with Castle Road. In 2006, the store was redeveloped. In 2016, it was decided that Next's remaining store would close at the end of April 2016 to allow a conversion of the site. Its successor was the clothing retailer, New Look, which was set to open its new flagship store at the end of September 2016. The store did, however, open on 25 July 2016, with a number of other stores opening around Bristol.\nThe store itself was later sold to Associated British Foods and re-branded into a Fresh Direct store after Associated British Foods bought the fresh food chain in February 2018. On 19 September 2018, BristolLive announced the closure of Fresh Direct's Freshpoint stores for redevelopment with retailers Next and Matalan. This new chain will come to Roper Bay and the area in the east of London.\nFor a time, the area was also home to British Retail Consortium's (BRC) store in the centre of town; however, the store moved in March 2016, after which, the area was redeveloped with the opening of the Bristol store of Matalan. The store opened its doors in September 2016 and was the largest Matalan store in the United Kingdom with a capacity of 10,000. The store also included a new range of stores called \"The Market\", designed by interior designer David Chipperfield.","token_len":651,"entropy":[8.7509,0.2172,1.8745,8.9394,3.5538,0.0132,4.5059,7.79,8.527,8.2983,1.4631,4.2397,3.9943,5.0491,1.8758,7.2894,5.2067,0.063,10.7457,0.6652,3.0104,10.2575,2.0345,5.2201,0.7831,7.6202,0.3749,3.1212,3.3348,0.8382,3.5642,1.4852,0.4519,4.5843,0.0524,0.0002,2.8663,0.1205,4.0864,7.7521,2.6484,9.19,4.0272,0.9559,4.1797,3.8864,0.0796,1.0783,2.5955,6.5837,0.7309,0.0872,2.2045,5.6965,2.8334,0.0037,8.3414,1.7564,2.036,6.3064,5.6941,5.654,5.3224,0.1189,1.1051,3.7727,7.0219,6.0823,5.3519,1.9653,0.0004,0.499,2.5118,4.8707,2.1824,5.576,0.1443,1.0554,8.9079,5.4128,5.6477,8.17,0.1223,2.5964,2.6397,5.0399,1.2586,5.8909,5.5842,3.1342,1.6642,5.8768,0.8511,2.5978,0.0424,3.4691,5.2885,4.531,0.0104,3.3784,3.4561,4.4785,5.0447,3.9622,3.1334,1.6063,5.0455,5.7919,1.811,7.5576,1.1404,1.2978,0.6605,4.7032,0.0672,2.4184,1.9209,4.0378,3.5747,6.9207,2.8765,2.9851,1.3179,7.3555,5.7542,0.6228,1.0366,7.5054,9.7725,1.2211,0.0002,1.6421,6.9274,1.821,2.1907,0.0028,1.7799,1.1135,0.0008,4.3676,3.0044,1.5489,1.1114,0.7465,6.4312,4.3226,2.6537,2.3555,8.6415,2.3957,0.1991,3.8199,5.1357,4.0635,2.6625,2.4829,0.0244,5.6665,4.3652,6.8611,5.8495,0.0059,0.0008,3.1393,4.7923,1.4004,8.5909,0.3754,0.8399,3.2653,5.7061,3.736,5.4774,1.1703,0.9617,0.0057,0.4388,2.4698,2.864,7.2868,0.2545,0.0289,2.4327,5.5848,7.2792,2.178,4.0437,1.4048,7.7189,0.0087,1.6377,5.3879,2.5063,2.5211,3.7903,0.0689,3.8924,0.7353,2.8473,0.3739,0.5538,4.3303,0.2089,5.704,7.8898,3.6735,0.2239,2.1484,0.0093,0.0008,3.991,4.0232,0.6606,0.2371,4.0229,2.2541,10.6066,0.1975,7.0753,8.0095,2.117,2.4537,2.7856,5.2273,1.1725,1.5214,0.1514,0.0023,1.5571,4.7291,8.2159,2.6572,9.6185,0.8554,0.9073,5.7529,1.074,0.6107,3.4513,5.241,2.4373,1.2707,0.4846,16.0657,3.0758,1.9715,2.043,4.6275,1.857,0.0023,6.782,0.1132,3.7506,1.1158,1.2942,7.5355,0.0306,0.7633,5.7923,1.3209,0.984,7.0879,0.0208,1.2574,6.0228,5.7875,0.0038,1.5332,0.0026,0.4943,1.315,7.7883,0.0772,0.0025,1.2953,3.0083,3.6882,0.2858,1.2561,2.9093,2.7607,3.3777,0.2649,6.0213,1.4563,0.2921,5.4381,1.3331,2.7719,1.6712,0.1603,6.8863,2.3077,3.623,4.7564,2.2799,0.0923,5.1216,0.0046,0.0012,4.9685,6.2688,3.3649,13.9547,3.5679,1.2219,3.992,1.8791,2.2909,0.0885,1.72,3.4845,1.5595,2.8546,2.8293,0.3298,6.4917,0.0223,1.6594,6.6247,1.1296,5.228,0.169,0.367,5.2864,0.4295,4.8595,0.7872,7.5701,0.089,2.7382,0.0043,0.0017,4.5338,4.4317,0.3727,1.3421,0.0001,1.5398,2.2384,2.1487,5.9934,4.9844,3.4433,4.0864,0.9646,2.7638,5.2264,2.0008,8.3111,3.6906,2.3397,0.3177,5.5738,0.1305,0.4904,2.8705,5.3416,3.5547,0.3741,0.0001,4.0859,4.5075,3.1961,4.7432,1.7284,8.954,4.0354,7.5981,3.0871,1.0486,2.8879,3.6364,1.6228,1.7071,3.165,0.022,6.9847,1.2701,0.0039,2.4699,7.1626,10.8865,4.183,3.0694,2.418,3.5611,0.1343,1.9025,2.5351,0.9053,4.5042,0.0012,4.6713,1.912,3.4032,0.1227,2.4432,1.048,7.0195,1.4596,0.8675,2.5709,5.116,2.301,1.103,4.294,3.098,0.5684,0.1757,0.0026,6.0242,3.1177,3.911,1.7523,3.7515,9.4724,0.9879,0.5602,3.4486,2.0281,6.2672,5.3998,2.7105,2.869,6.8324,2.1004,3.1584,5.176,4.0561,0.9376,0.3803,2.1237,5.0784,0.5263,0.8419,1.7311,2.9198,3.6003,0.214,1.7519,1.6696,3.4112,0.0012,3.0052,1.6425,0.1831,2.321,2.2167,6.671,4.5563,0.018,0.0277,1.8507,2.616,5.9851,3.6212,1.2156,1.4645,2.3597,1.7696,4.4242,0.0067,2.7154,1.1318,1.6656,4.0787,9.2603,1.6424,0.6718,13.4373,4.0735,4.5623,1.61,6.0058,2.5846,0.737,9.729,6.132,5.6661,2.777,5.7648,1.5027,1.1461,5.1531,2.3026,8.5569,6.7978,2.1819,5.0457,11.0405,2.3734,0.2587,2.4157,0.7999,9.1147,1.6735,1.1759,1.6116,4.3196,2.5879,0.1981,5.6785,4.0551,2.4033,1.3235,0.1203,6.4322,13.1518,2.4362,2.1733,2.0443,0.1207,5.6374,0.0766,2.1254,3.8248,7.4838,3.1983,3.7403,6.9357,5.5875,8.1007,8.0274,0.9485,10.3871,9.0513,1.8301,4.5007,4.6484,5.6808,1.6049,6.2894,0.8648,6.6544,0.0558,0.0265,2.1599,2.4575,3.2524,3.1244,1.1512,7.9585,0.9027,3.4433,0.7801,0.5607,14.4651,3.1215,5.9191,0.3437,1.4584,2.4846,0.574,3.4971,1.1519,0.0031,5.5568,7.2079,4.0322,3.0533,2.0737,0.3838,0.0669,0.4265,4.2955,2.3826,1.7153,4.3128,0.0937,2.685,4.8488,3.705,0.1324,1.8524,2.4011,4.7486,3.4663,4.3664,2.0964,1.9213,2.6869,2.9876,4.0396,1.6641,3.3914,0.621,2.8787,0.0052,3.5925,1.9996,5.1931,0.0406,1.7255,3.5068,4.9928,5.3163,8.1512,0.0181,0.8251,1.9602,2.5155,2.7137,3.6205,0.5949,1.36,2.5666,1.0084,1.4026,2.3311,3.2387,3.7827,9.0341,0.0033,0.3933,0.7557,0.5531,4.878,0.0134,3.2244,2.0072,3.2855,0.045,4.2572,0.0908,0.3977,0.9467,1.9377,1.9117,2.4917,5.3212,0.9969,3.605,5.9273,0.061,5.5397,5.3596,3.3153,3.151,5.6157,1.4707,4.9598,1.2248,9.0074,0.1984,4.2035,6.0014,5.5994,0.008,0.8029]}
{"prompt":"As with many Scottish islands , Skye 's population peaked in the 19th century and then declined under the impact of the Clearances and the military losses in the First World War . From the","text":"As with many Scottish islands, Skye's population peaked in the 19th century and then declined under the impact of the Clearances and the military losses in the First World War. From the 1940s, Skye saw an influx of new settlers ( many of whom were Scots themselves ), resulting in the current levels of population ; Skye's total population is now some 44,000, and Skye's ageing rate is above the UK average.\nThe population of Skye is ageing, with the rate of increase in the number of those aged eighty and over five times that of young children: it reached its highest level in 1973 when it had 7,100 people over the age of eighty and in 2004 was 17,000. This increase has been due to fewer immigrants than expected reaching the island and a significant increase in deaths. In 2004 there were 4,900 deaths at a rate of 22.8 per ten thousand; this has been down slightly over recent years due to reductions in the number of immigrants arriving to the island. In 2002-03, an estimated 2.5 per cent of Skye residents were refugees from overseas - a number far greater than expected. A 2002 survey on elderly people living on isolated islands noted that over 70 per cent of the over eighty year olds, compared with 17 per cent in the UK as a whole, did not intend to return to their home countries after their retirement, and that many of the younger over eighty years old in the country intended to remain permanently on Skye.\nSkye has a very high rate of emigration, with some 6,000 people emigrating each year from the island in the early 1990s, most to England and the USA.\nSkye's economy derives its livelihoods from the island of Skye ( and its associated settlements ) and from the fishing off the north and east coasts of the island. Income is the product of agriculture, forestry, fishing, transport, construction, education, tourism and the sale of farm produce to mainland companies. The annual value of Skye's agricultural products in 2003-04 was \u00a316.4m. With no industry, except for tourism, Skye relies heavily on imports and exports of goods. The major trading partners of Skye are, for the most part, other parts of the UK. The island has a thriving maritime industry, dominated by the fishing industry, shipping and offshore industry. In 2003-04, the value of the fishing industry was \u00a31.5m, making it the most important industry of the island. The export of fish, shellfish and farm produce was worth an estimated \u00a37m to the UK mainland in 2004.

{"prompt":"The fifth commandment forbids suicide and the mercy killing of those who are dying , even to eliminate suffering . The ordinary care of those facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld ,","text":"The fifth commandment forbids suicide and the mercy killing of those who are dying, even to eliminate suffering. The ordinary care of those facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld, but the physician or physician-assisted suicide, as well as the physician and voluntary euthanasia, for example, against the will of the terminally ill, are prohibited. This is one of the principles of Kant's moral philosophy and is also the underlying basis of his ethics. The third point in this area, as Kant also indicates, is a desire for a kind treatment towards those who are helpless, regardless of their age.\nThe sixth commandment provides that the physician must respect and observe his oath, which he takes before his name. The physician also promises not to do evil things under any circumstances, he must not disobey his conscience or use the power he has just obtained to harm any person with whom he has some contact. Finally, there can be no such thing as stealing and, in addition, not to lie to a dying patient, to commit adultery or be involved in unlawful behavior.\nIt is also important to note that in order to take care of a patient in the best possible way, it is necessary to ask questions about the patient's values and beliefs, so that the patient takes care of each step of the treatment in accordance with his own will. But it is important to stress that no single question must be asked repeatedly, as this may cause insecurity and fear in the patient.\nThe second part of the fifth commandment also provides the physician with the duty of not harming the patient during treatment or any other situation and even if he must kill the patient, he should do it the least possible. The last part of the fifth commandment includes two other principles that are vital in the treatment of elderly or terminally ill patients, including refraining from excessive or unnecessary pain and suffering and preventing suicide.\nThe seventh commandment includes a requirement to treat the patient justly, with the greatest care and respect and to treat each patient who comes to him in his own way. In addition, it is important to avoid discriminating against a patient and to remember each patient's individual history, life experience and values. Finally, it is important to remember that the physician will have to make some kind of decision for the treatment of the patient and that treatment must be made in a way that is consistent with the patient's history, beliefs and values.\nThe eighth commandment, in turn, involves the obligation to always provide the doctor with information that is beneficial to the patient, including information regarding the benefits and risks of the treatment. It is also important to emphasize that when a decision has been made about the patient's treatment, the doctor must be committed to that decision and not to use any other options. It is also important to note that physicians and families have the right to refuse certain treatments.\nThe ninth commandment requires the physician to ask the patient for his or her permission to make health care decisions and to give medical advice to the patient only with respect for his or her history, values \u200b\u200band beliefs. Finally, it is also important to remember the right of the patient to decide on the use of his or her body when he or she dies.","token_len":652,"entropy":[8.8637,7.5858,0.6503,5.275,6.8828,2.2396,2.5143,10.5043,5.4877,0.4144,3.1329,0.4288,1.7573,5.5656,2.4638,4.0594,3.2297,8.8136,6.765,1.0834,2.0793,10.0013,8.725,1.6753,2.8215,7.2245,5.0526,1.5077,1.0796,4.3761,2.4461,10.6053,2.2141,8.4853,1.804,0.8079,1.9127,8.4012,3.1924,2.7336,1.3289,2.888,0.2841,5.012,2.4714,2.8908,0.0176,1.2678,5.4702,4.5436,7.134,0.6566,0.0011,0.5657,5.8207,1.8735,0.0913,8.2801,1.4298,1.881,0.0373,0.6673,4.901,0.0604,0.0208,0.5075,1.3283,3.1167,0.5485,3.7944,1.8515,4.3332,0.5444,0.1264,5.5588,0.6844,8.0301,0.2378,4.2293,1.4394,2.8971,2.2245,3.7713,1.4943,6.3715,3.272,0.4397,1.2253,3.9353,0.4287,2.4062,3.1925,6.1208,3.5121,2.0524,6.8623,2.7162,3.8432,5.6832,5.2057,7.5591,0.4761,0.4605,3.7438,6.1511,1.3579,2.8006,4.8873,10.002,7.4143,1.242,0.6451,0.9467,6.6802,1.5521,5.9616,0.0132,1.0332,4.3541,2.8396,2.0453,7.0109,2.9861,0.2586,0.0004,5.5281,1.3264,1.9791,3.846,2.4849,6.0535,2.7029,5.0635,4.2167,8.1841,2.348,2.87,2.0721,3.5004,5.0432,2.7442,7.6891,1.1499,1.4339,2.2989,3.7025,7.6942,2.6446,0.0128,4.0872,3.3298,5.5361,6.9075,1.0588,0.1032,1.0481,6.2567,2.8218,1.5468,5.6009,0.0002,1.3542,4.3431,1.9476,4.9202,2.9058,2.493,3.0224,0.6349,5.6851,2.435,1.4381,2.5478,3.8276,0.6968,4.976,3.198,0.0648,1.2003,4.8453,3.8239,0.5039,4.3895,0.0866,3.994,5.5644,0.0666,0.0505,4.7078,0.8513,0.0166,8.6212,3.3965,4.7243,2.005,3.7063,0.3735,4.5118,2.3753,4.9543,1.7745,2.8755,3.6156,2.8239,2.0239,3.8327,3.2156,2.0142,1.7908,4.8434,3.6642,0.0358,5.3685,4.1668,0.5821,1.1576,4.1473,0.4621,3.127,1.6317,0.1334,0.7205,0.134,2.9315,3.2241,0.2953,4.7129,2.4819,0.0153,2.1183,1.9623,2.8724,2.1054,5.2323,1.5882,0.5142,0.1651,2.4152,0.1691,1.2886,0.4183,4.4466,2.6762,1.5322,1.1841,0.8546,0.4186,8.5619,1.0343,3.0798,1.5596,4.4394,0.321,1.4706,1.3386,5.9237,1.6424,0.04,7.2246,6.3112,1.0883,0.3274,3.8857,4.3913,2.7156,0.0374,1.0155,1.0688,4.9909,0.3522,5.4266,2.4153,0.2587,1.7879,0.5246,4.5425,0.2202,4.4153,4.6815,4.5276,3.9921,0.3209,1.9207,8.142,1.473,2.9212,2.9122,3.3508,2.5965,9.0871,1.221,4.33,1.6904,0.6664,0.2454,0.5757,1.4136,1.5664,5.9546,3.1424,0.067,0.5575,3.8967,0.0585,0.0006,4.0689,2.5727,2.9855,3.8817,0.4703,1.1193,3.4,0.9001,5.1592,3.3938,2.0572,0.8864,4.8515,2.3082,3.3289,3.8611,0.6335,2.8138,5.1514,5.5616,2.432,1.5147,6.162,4.2814,1.1016,0.1519,1.4083,1.0749,2.4087,2.3756,1.9905,6.3912,5.0051,2.7924,3.6931,1.8418,4.691,1.0638,0.5012,0.1853,1.1482,0.0184,0.0006,4.3849,5.435,2.5371,2.7939,2.1415,1.2606,5.2447,2.1779,1.576,0.9462,0.0526,7.6271,4.5,1.996,0.0011,0.009,0.6528,2.0294,5.2363,10.9722,0.3308,0.008,5.1743,3.4923,2.6077,1.9891,1.3243,0.3179,2.1401,5.4255,4.4055,0.8832,0.7297,1.2409,2.1282,0.1997,0.0005,3.942,1.9074,3.321,2.2096,2.5276,1.5488,0.6808,6.6479,1.0863,1.3497,2.8089,2.2114,3.0819,1.0734,1.2695,2.645,3.112,1.8515,2.1767,3.4395,0.9924,4.7821,4.3884,0.8861,1.2338,2.3235,3.4236,1.7227,1.0597,1.7117,2.7898,2.4853,0.3673,1.9684,1.7471,1.1453,0.3654,5.2071,6.8962,1.4784,2.5862,0.8149,4.4764,1.4762,5.7885,7.4155,0.3232,0.353,3.9116,5.0452,1.785,6.2681,2.2927,0.899,5.6115,0.7969,3.917,0.055,0.8257,0.1573,0.3388,0.2167,1.9916,0.2213,1.5163,2.1056,3.4593,4.2371,1.5897,3.3694,4.4659,3.1246,0.0113,1.331,3.8971,1.2068,1.7801,0.4778,1.338,0.2503,2.6893,1.6007,6.499,2.0683,0.4984,4.0142,1.6774,1.1402,1.4192,0.1801,1.2393,3.0193,0.0213,0.7595,0.6122,0.0153,7.1729,0.9197,3.5231,0.375,0.6604,0.2941,0.4784,1.2578,0.4322,0.1461,0.0003,2.588,3.1427,4.0201,0.0153,5.8899,1.0137,3.1505,0.4313,6.0695,3.7566,1.7379,5.1624,0.1037,2.8197,2.3659,1.8592,5.1256,0.4967,0.3472,0.2156,1.5696,2.8425,1.7244,3.2106,0.9643,6.0578,1.3101,0.9063,0.5453,1.202,0.5908,1.161,2.0185,0.8999,2.0704,0.1457,0.2608,4.067,0.2079,4.1829,1.6518,5.4503,2.847,0.5909,0.1226,3.0952,0.9381,2.1166,0.8698,0.761,0.5273,0.9362,1.0105,1.325,3.0922,6.2277,0.0527,3.1715,0.1589,1.42,2.5497,0.6988,5.2506,2.4527,2.6063,5.6786,1.3795,2.9964,0.2273,1.316,0.1067,0.2583,1.6875,0.0678,5.7875,3.4075,5.9816,3.0947,2.286,0.8026,0.095,3.2239,5.7278,2.2359,2.8599,0.9895,0.9997,0.2134,0.1585,0.0007,4.3278,1.2215,1.0161,0.0927,5.2356,1.6072,0.4272,2.3129,2.0793,1.0071,0.0051,4.2987,0.3485,3.8725,6.2214,0.862,0.1991,2.4703,0.911,3.1737,4.5136,0.5796,1.7136,0.4335,0.2494,5.4206,3.9876,3.6283,3.4602,1.2452,0.0359,0.0019,7.297,0.871,3.2392,15.1972,0.3736,0.4687,2.7586,0.4299,4.237,0.0407,0.4651,0.574,3.1489,0.0793,0.1121,1.6728,4.1603,3.677,0.9734,0.7458,0.5325,0.1675,3.2271,2.5264,2.0197,4.1677,0.1216,2.238,0.013,0.0009,3.495,3.7922,1.6083,0.0468,0.0023,3.4843,0.6156]}

His family had lived in Milk Street at the same time as the < unk > \u2014 Samuel's father still ran the Dolphin Coffeehouse at the corner of Queen Anne St and Upper Brook St around the time this portrait was made. The Beetons married and moved out in 1858. A photograph of Samuel, taken around this time, is in MNRAC and the Beetons were prominent merchants and manufacturers of sugar, molasses etc. A later photograph in MNRAC shows Isabella married. Isabella's sister Anne ( who later used to sell flowers in Milk St ) was engaged on 27 September 1859 to William Dennison, master of the York and Albany mail at that time. William was the son of William Dennison and his wife Helen, daughter of Major Charles Dennison and Martha, daughter of Edward Dick. When William was still in Australia he bought the schooner'York'and took a crew of 18 sailors from the York and Albany. On 28 February 1859 William sailed on York for New York City, arriving on 17 March 1859. William did have a daughter, born in Sydney on 19 October 1859 \u2013 Anne Dennison, as you may remember. After her marriage to William, Isabella took up painting, becoming a pupil of A. J. St. Lawrence, a distinguished figure with a studio in Chatsworth St, and her portrait may be seen in the MNRAC Portrait Gallery.\nIn 1862 Isabella took up her new role as wife to Samuel. They had children and lived in High Park Street \u2014 presumably around 1868. Samuel seems to have been a good husband but Isabella's health suffered from the work and stress of running the office. Her husband fell seriously ill and died in 1882 probably in Liverpool where Isabella was based. An unmarked photograph of Samuel & Isabella ( courtesy S & I Family Album )\nIt appears a few of her brothers have settled down in Australia \u2014 see J. P. B. on the right, in 1884, and W. H. on the left, on a boat in the 1860s \u2014 and there are references to him in the MNRAC Album of Family Photos.\nSamuel Orchart Beeton died on 9 May 1883. His unmarked photograph is in the MNRAC Album and his later photograph is in the MNRAC Portrait Gallery.\nWe have no further information about his family until 1891 when his daughter Anne married Edward Dick in Brisbane.\nAnne was a painter and portrait artist and her daughter ( later Mrs. William M. St. Lawrence ) was a decorator. She is shown, married to the younger St. Lawrence, in the MNRAC Portrait Gallery.\nHugh Orchart Beeton, brother of Samuel, who lived on Milk St, was a member of Parliament in 1888.\nWe don't know about Samuel and Isabella's children after this period. Perhaps one or both settled in Australia.\nCharles Orchart Beeton, Samuel's oldest son ( by his first wife ) came over in 1870 and served in South Africa.

Unlike the ship of the line, the battleships of the Royal Navy could be deployed to many of the European waters where the French Navy was operating. The battleships of the British and French navies were deployed to different fronts. The British battleships were deployed as part of the British Expeditionary Force, participating in the Battle of Jutland, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Solent. Meanwhile, the French battleships were part of Franco-British forces, operating in the Mediterranean (Operation Torch ) and Atlantic (Battle of the Atlantic ), and the North Sea (Battle of Jutland II ) as well as the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, the battleships of the British Empire fleet operated with the Royal Navy, Royal German Navy, and Royal Italian Navy. The British Empire fleet was composed of five battleships ( HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Vanguard, HMS Illustrious, HMS Victory, and HMS Royal Oak ), four battleships ( HMS Duke of York, HMS Foudroyant, HMS Tonnant, and HMS Repulse ), and seven cruisers ( HMS Royal Ark, HMS Ajax, HMS Ajax, HMS Temeraire, HMS Suffolk, HMS Dido, and HMS Queen Mary ). The British Empire fleet was tasked with escorting convoys, engaging aircrafts, and acting as a screen between the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. In their role as a screen, the British Empire fleet provided protection against submarines by attacking and destroying the enemy. The British Empire fleet supported British troops by landing troops on beaches and conducting coastal bombardments.\nThe battleships of the France fleet operated with the Mediterranean and Atlantic French Navy. Between September 1942 and May 1943, the battleships of the Allies and Axis engaged in various operations off the coast of Germany and Italy. During these operations, French battleships were engaged in close combat with German and Italian battleships. As part of the Operation Torch plan, the battleships of the Mediterranean and Atlantic French Navy were dispatched to the Mediterranean to act as a screen and guard against German and Italian attacks on French and British convoys.\nBefore the First World War, battleships were considered the superior ships of the line with respect to naval warfare. The battle in Jutland demonstrated that during a single engagement the battleships of both the Allies and Axis made significant losses. As a result, the Royal Navy commissioned a number of new battleships to replace those lost and commissioned over 100 new battleships for its fleet over the next 15 years. This was known as the Royal Navy's Great Build-Up. A new battleship was commissioned about once every five years during this time.\nThe French government also started commissioning new battleships in the early 1920s. This Great Build-Up was based on concepts of naval warfare introduced by the French Navy's General Staff. For example, the French Navy's new battleships were designed to have long-range, high speed, and fast maneuvering capabilities. These battleships were known as light cruisers because they were larger than their predecessors but smaller in overall length and displacement.","token_len":653,"entropy":[2.2488,8.4078,0.287,12.0291,2.2141,1.2651,5.9945,3.9995,1.0527,9.7277,12.4265,10.8378,7.5126,5.3591,7.9348,0.7991,1.3664,8.4424,0.4095,4.7141,0.7971,4.3058,1.4209,4.2359,2.5085,0.7463,5.842,1.4745,6.8239,4.4894,0.9903,8.3487,0.7789,1.6683,1.5265,1.5247,1.3049,0.328,6.5656,0.1064,3.3959,1.7813,1.7859,2.9416,5.0162,4.4489,0.2396,5.974,6.1163,3.9897,1.8327,5.1301,2.9895,1.1954,4.3251,1.0442,1.8983,2.9035,0.2664,1.0016,0.1589,3.192,2.4639,1.6748,1.4196,0.0005,1.2337,3.451,1.1402,4.7028,5.9338,2.1034,1.7089,1.8558,3.1965,0.1964,1.042,2.2926,3.6737,2.4646,0.0033,0.6112,2.2072,3.6783,0.023,0.8264,1.5483,8.734,0.1444,1.0583,2.565,0.0257,7.2165,0.4027,0.0018,1.5683,1.2933,0.5898,0.0152,3.6077,0.3107,0.6777,0.2513,0.4361,0.0135,1.6459,7.7736,3.5233,0.6596,6.8727,0.3654,0.2347,0.9654,1.9883,0.1781,0.6255,4.679,0.0029,9.2154,2.0369,2.5162,2.0301,2.1256,3.81,1.1383,0.72,2.4,4.686,4.5015,9.3482,6.9393,0.5658,5.4137,0.4575,7.6937,0.0836,1.7586,3.8134,3.8521,1.445,2.1269,6.8299,1.6197,0.3373,3.3535,0.0036,7.7155,0.0972,0.0039,6.4503,2.2058,2.3027,0.731,0.6479,1.2037,2.1112,2.4887,1.0318,2.9121,0.7223,1.9511,7.1798,0.6,3.6995,0.0167,2.322,3.1452,0.7651,0.7299,2.924,0.2926,0.4264,0.1599,1.154,5.188,7.8026,5.3182,3.8697,1.4161,2.9874,0.2178,2.2266,6.4825,7.7974,0.6432,0.2576,0.5032,1.4142,2.7256,0.0957,0.9151,1.3832,1.9624,3.467,2.146,1.368,2.9837,0.2474,4.0242,2.5768,0.0204,2.8908,4.9345,3.6424,0.2434,0.0011,0.7012,0.0737,6.4227,0.1786,0.1376,7.9942,0.0152,0.3585,0.2817,5.1874,0.3702,1.6447,0.0535,4.4661,5.4942,4.9679,3.6133,2.0397,0.0127,0.1852,0.1201,5.0763,0.0922,1.4885,0.5188,0.0262,6.1375,9.7269,9.4521,6.2053,0.2531,0.164,9.567,8.9377,0.3005,1.0369,0.0283,9.4735,1.1861,0.6729,0.6606,3.8105,2.6768,0.0019,0.3982,0.1416,3.9792,7.4084,1.382,0.0324,7.3341,0.4004,0.2894,5.435,2.2935,0.3578,9.4106,5.8263,7.9346,0.3943,0.5156,11.6316,0.273,0.3424,10.7215,2.448,0.5037,0.8487,0.0297,4.255,3.615,1.1581,1.2933,1.6586,1.2278,1.3637,1.0501,7.315,0.0898,5.7291,0.0172,6.2074,0.0065,3.5884,6.0488,6.3043,6.0226,0.2739,0.5156,6.8276,0.1732,0.9704,7.9694,3.8735,0.6234,4.1065,6.8104,0.3094,0.4834,3.7107,1.8667,0.3666,2.948,6.1627,2.551,0.3401,2.3103,3.3777,0.2478,0.3453,0.7552,1.1122,2.3491,4.5925,4.2654,1.7843,4.1986,4.9369,3.8708,2.6622,2.8201,2.6788,2.0106,3.7157,1.6195,0.7721,0.899,1.3454,6.1004,3.8491,3.4249,3.8535,5.3215,4.415,1.7774,2.9272,1.0368,4.588,7.3125,5.5139,0.0389,0.6791,1.74,1.4221,3.3342,0.3154,0.3319,0.0993,8.1931,1.8181,2.8136,1.4873,0.1809,7.7903,2.2115,1.3643,8.7235,1.9452,0.613,6.3497,4.612,4.3255,0.0624,2.4946,0.7523,0.1694,0.4335,1.9357,0.1273,0.2079,0.1132,7.5248,2.7691,3.6939,8.4623,0.3592,4.209,2.2655,7.7826,0.3337,1.0254,0.0348,3.767,1.7177,2.4182,0.3866,2.2988,2.1257,0.7098,0.1504,4.7638,3.0133,0.0366,1.8119,3.0275,0.3029,4.6021,1.0807,0.437,1.8424,2.4735,1.4791,1.8323,0.005,0.8252,4.3338,1.922,0.0007,0.7021,3.4518,2.1734,7.2543,0.2197,0.4852,2.8705,0.1054,0.2489,0.1258,6.4965,0.5289,0.9055,2.5432,0.5663,1.3034,3.9243,0.3942,1.5857,1.739,2.0802,4.6529,0.0547,1.0873,0.4544,3.4395,5.3115,0.2221,3.2695,0.6998,0.0899,2.6916,1.9561,3.3596,1.2406,2.6342,6.7821,0.0002,0.455,1.5032,6.5232,0.5622,5.3099,0.2739,0.0019,0.216,3.0816,0.0883,1.6856,4.4444,3.1999,6.708,3.1229,0.6978,0.2925,3.5029,5.9111,4.8932,0.0042,3.6295,3.8515,0.4586,1.8766,3.2616,7.103,6.6301,0.0267,0.001,6.1411,0.757,6.2392,2.9938,4.0027,2.2278,2.2924,2.2745,0.1758,0.3179,2.6524,1.7026,4.2712,0.0257,0.0713,5.3977,3.5992,5.5292,0.8393,3.877,0.9339,0.1119,0.459,0.656,4.0285,0.1255,5.2117,2.0946,1.891,0.0012,3.0105,0.647,0.0149,1.8259,1.77,3.6897,3.4451,4.142,5.9202,5.4833,2.4228,1.1136,1.0315,0.0105,2.8317,3.9976,2.7007,5.7461,0.182,1.5373,3.965,0.0232,0.1696,4.2253,2.7228,5.9572,0.0323,0.2085,3.3274,1.085,1.9117,4.4292,9.1372,1.7565,1.2858,1.0391,4.8493,2.2441,4.0089,0.0168,1.0598,0.9414,7.1069,5.3702,0.8987,2.7633,0.0591,3.8402,2.1647,1.4278,1.3822,1.2969,1.3925,3.7991,6.9069,3.3768,5.3607,6.9184,0.0003,1.1153,0.4422,0.0133,1.8319,1.6954,2.0485,3.063,0.0977,0.6496,3.0806,9.9354,0.121,0.0318,0.0212,1.3455,4.1554,0.2079,6.1304,1.5315,4.4794,1.5865,6.6311,0.8625,0.5299,1.828,3.4798,3.6491,4.2432,0.9387,1.7341,4.4288,0.6764,0.0284,0.774,1.5604,1.1211,2.1253,3.9499,1.695,0.354,1.3528,1.8475,0.3843,3.4941,4.9534,2.1462,0.1112,3.0526,2.7483,2.4127,1.2391,0.781,3.8499,3.0718,2.0722,0.6514,0.784,2.6581,4.144,0.0079,0.9813,4.991,0.1541,6.1586,0.7555,0.0003,4.2249,0.7589,0.9212,4.7646,0.7192,1.983,3.3806,3.499,4.0204,2.728,4.1785,1.9442,1.4141,3.8827,0.5225]}

Later that year, they visited the Grand Palais in the French Canadian capital, Qu\u00e9bec City, from where the team was playing for the Stanley Cup.","token_len":653,"entropy":[6.7054,9.6063,2.1205,3.6469,4.4425,7.7173,0.4214,0.6407,2.4421,9.446,2.8273,3.8122,10.0014,1.6765,2.3689,6.0251,0.176,2.1343,12.047,1.6739,2.4742,5.0832,6.6204,1.5541,2.6476,6.243,0.8299,2.8792,5.9524,2.1946,1.96,4.7584,5.069,3.7489,3.8,0.2056,6.6873,2.8796,5.6292,4.901,3.2198,1.3597,5.6358,5.936,0.634,7.0838,4.0966,5.057,2.8758,2.0657,0.8154,3.6903,0.361,1.7466,2.8484,1.7624,2.4823,2.7002,3.4054,2.6064,0.4105,2.9278,3.3071,0.0054,1.7984,1.2437,3.9997,2.7404,0.4106,5.0111,0.6657,3.9826,5.4317,2.0386,1.4528,4.2676,6.5874,5.2813,5.2865,1.5887,2.4894,2.0576,1.3629,2.2073,1.8641,4.2307,5.2254,0.6473,2.7041,0.0811,2.3367,0.6676,3.7403,0.9038,7.467,0.466,0.7702,1.5167,3.7284,0.1436,1.4428,3.5108,2.5121,3.1888,4.1273,0.0386,1.1364,0.1948,3.6383,2.955,10.2951,1.8046,1.0973,7.8335,2.3157,4.4476,0.4475,0.74,0.7467,2.9816,0.8871,2.7331,0.578,1.4498,0.3057,0.5248,1.805,3.8818,1.5787,3.2207,1.4284,4.8163,2.1091,4.2044,1.6866,1.9301,0.0213,1.666,0.0994,6.233,0.9374,1.5655,5.8294,0.8289,6.7698,2.5584,3.1826,0.4737,1.5346,1.4663,0.6706,8.6062,2.044,5.1205,0.0283,4.3535,1.0345,4.3746,2.5554,1.6754,1.0906,3.1711,6.4606,1.1853,0.0122,5.6017,3.3239,1.1507,2.047,0.2053,3.2359,0.386,0.9806,5.022,1.1929,3.7841,1.1795,1.8353,2.2223,0.005,3.2104,3.8159,0.5379,3.2152,0.0169,0.4188,1.9509,4.0748,4.0858,0.2497,0.9962,1.2749,4.8612,0.2562,1.765,0.0131,2.6619,2.101,2.318,2.6418,0.1319,1.7999,5.5091,1.6709,4.5009,0.8988,0.5029,0.0,1.7372,2.9733,5.4803,2.5814,5.2372,4.4264,3.0154,3.0474,0.8224,0.0686,5.0732,2.4647,9.3993,1.5935,3.3787,6.4506,1.5252,2.3647,0.9876,5.0406,1.2632,6.1434,0.3319,1.2675,3.1084,2.7876,1.8091,1.1796,0.1244,1.2291,0.7055,0.0055,3.7669,9.1324,0.2153,0.0008,0.0003,1.146,1.7132,0.5494,3.0858,0.0759,5.0374,0.2651,0.6906,3.1243,1.0162,0.3359,4.5422,1.1983,0.0073,1.4402,2.225,5.0932,4.2868,5.0692,1.2877,2.6777,4.1208,3.5802,0.4813,3.3738,3.2649,1.6684,6.0342,0.2857,2.2031,0.1531,1.6713,2.1107,0.7319,4.9917,4.2583,1.024,5.4532,0.0979,2.3082,5.5265,0.8422,1.3978,0.9817,0.1434,6.641,0.0321,0.951,1.8389,5.6866,2.328,4.4323,0.1316,6.8736,0.8025,6.6817,0.1705,2.0589,0.1146,0.9067,1.8527,0.2206,1.8358,0.2396,0.0019,1.6068,1.5822,3.6689,4.4826,6.468,0.8021,1.2202,1.6113,4.2084,0.5475,5.3221,8.3362,3.7604,0.0335,2.1326,4.1573,0.3841,2.8772,2.7064,2.2106,1.6679,3.136,3.6254,0.0508,3.4155,0.9176,3.0039,1.0049,1.5751,2.3454,2.8884,1.106,5.8507,1.2194,4.9549,0.5109,6.0403,6.8974,0.802,4.4848,0.5281,2.8332,6.3436,0.1078,4.346,2.9846,0.0006,0.0006,1.6235,5.021,3.0811,2.6478,3.368,0.0975,3.1941,2.2654,3.0274,0.2525,5.2282,0.0097,1.9204,4.8571,7.0683,0.0467,0.4603,0.1742,0.7576,2.2542,5.5597,5.3296,3.2197,0.8775,0.4443,0.0725,0.7331,0.598,1.2493,3.7969,1.9663,5.06,3.9728,0.9123,3.6669,4.5339,3.8367,11.3943,5.6622,2.8407,16.9965,1.2552,1.3653,5.122,2.4582,6.2335,3.4265,7.4125,1.4904,5.6311,5.3669,0.494,2.555,2.3926,16.7651,7.5354,5.877,5.9249,3.0309,6.4888,3.2545,1.2647,0.899,1.309,0.6644,1.4022,5.5732,11.2079,0.7707,1.2256,4.8996,0.7018,3.4783,4.6906,4.4803,0.4764,5.4037,0.3612,0.497,0.784,2.75,2.9245,1.952,2.0707,1.0822,3.1844,0.038,0.905,5.4317,0.3591,1.879,3.589,0.1051,0.2988,5.2491,0.1284,0.3002,3.7788,2.9541,2.9859,1.7981,1.7432,4.8267,1.101,3.3859,3.5906,1.8322,2.522,0.2241,1.3039,1.0371,2.4121,4.327,3.2961,3.3401,1.7419,2.6156,4.8889,1.1823,1.8647,2.9329,0.0948,5.2583,4.316,0.6258,2.8653,2.0403,7.7697,0.8013,2.1835,4.7172,0.6778,5.1722,1.4757,7.3707,1.7379,0.1833,0.2136,0.8775,1.8826,2.0042,5.1595,3.5728,1.2271,2.1681,6.9821,0.167,0.8282,2.4319,2.1568,0.6974,4.1382,6.1246,4.1628,1.527,6.8308,3.1819,6.0985,0.5004,1.1914,1.2226,0.0094,1.1998,2.0033,0.6599,5.0821,3.7689,6.1525,4.8839,4.9069,7.3678,0.1101,0.8742,1.1204,3.3281,1.0679,4.3613,0.0231,7.9984,2.301,1.739,3.4671,0.0052,1.3397,5.4691,5.6373,0.3274,5.6299,2.6175,4.9236,1.5365,2.5768,1.7212,6.5492,1.4959,1.6937,3.8769,0.1872,2.431,1.3789,4.7602,3.6121,3.3826,0.069,4.0026,0.1528,2.254,2.2053,6.5532,0.1657,6.8025,2.4219,4.5848,0.1007,1.9316,2.4424,2.946,1.9424,4.2462,1.7398,4.138,2.6247,0.8885,3.9679,3.9017,2.3779,5.3256,7.4756,6.1103,1.8499,3.1279,1.4224,5.5797,0.0794,2.3247,4.5627,4.3151,0.2228,1.2328,0.2466,0.0053,3.6219,2.1385,1.4072,2.9099,1.5268,2.4184,2.2993,2.5697,0.273,4.2796,0.0451,1.2935,2.6866,2.2897,0.1635,1.2975,1.0552,0.0486,0.1988,3.4388,0.053,1.3122,5.2367,1.2702,2.5585,0.3083,2.0121,2.479,1.0454,5.7622,5.6199,0.0024,3.1158,3.1639,3.0868,4.8323,2.9086,1.4546,6.0822,0.0004,0.7708,1.1618,6.5049,1.5559,2.2284,3.079,1.5554,1.9629,3.3787,0.4088,4.0526,0.0034,0.5272]}
{"prompt":"Alkan was a child prodigy . He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at an unusually early age , and studied both piano and organ . The records of his auditions survive in the Archives Nationales","text":"Alkan was a child prodigy. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at an unusually early age, and studied both piano and organ. The records of his auditions survive in the Archives Nationales de France. He was awarded a scholarship for piano, and while studying there he won the Prix de Rome. He later became a prize pupil of Emmanuel Bourdin, and earned a doctorate in organ with the best examination papers in the Conservatoire. Alkan married the pianist Pauline Viardot on 14 May 1880, and moved to Paris ; he was immediately hired by the conservatoire as an improviser and accompanist. Viardot often played herself instead of Alkan. The two first albums of Viardot playing Alkan appeared in 1881 and 1883. Alkan also introduced his own piano trio with Viardot and violinist Michel-Richard Sch\u00f6nberg.\nAlkan became a major figure in French music, working widely in concert, and leading the Conservatoire Ensemble and the Ch\u0153ur du Conservatoire. He became particularly renowned for writing works of Choral and Sacred music, and is considered one of the leading French composers of the 19th century. He was a major inspirational figure of both composers and organists in his day. Alkan was also a pioneer of the piano solo genre, and used his virtuoso style in a wide variety of solo pieces.\nAlkan was appointed to the position of musical director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and later of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. This led to the composition of the lively and varied concert piece L'Entr\u00e9e des artistes for piano and orchestra. Alkan composed opera seria for the opera house including La Fille aux yeux de fa\u00efence in 1884 for Pauline Viardot, Ad\u00e8le de Morny, and Auguste Piquet ; his opus 24, L'enfant prodigue, was performed in 1887. The premiere of the opera was performed by Viardot, Sch\u00f6nberg, and Charles Ritchie.\nAlkan wrote for orchestra in addition to choral and piano music. His musical style combines a vigorous melodic style, some rhythmic complexity, and an elegant technique. His use of harmonies and rhythms, and the manner in which he introduces them into the score are often suggestive rather than formal, and his style is often called Impressionist or atonal. Alkan was perhaps first to introduce a soloist to the Ch\u0153ur du Conservatoire, and he frequently used virtuosity of tone production, and the use of unusual techniques of articulation, to create interesting effects. In 1896 he published a book on his technique, which was greatly popular. Alkan also wrote many pieces for piano and orchestra, with virtuoso passages which are often considered difficult. His work is considered to be difficult and technically challenging. Although he often wrote with orchestra his chamber music, such as for piano two and horns, is also well received.\nAlkan also composed a large number of songs, including works written for Viardot.","token_len":653,"entropy":[9.933,4.2743,2.9072,6.3298,5.2247,0.0183,2.2197,1.0334,6.3272,0.8736,9.4346,2.9706,0.1769,1.4416,2.903,3.6542,5.2926,5.7873,2.9885,0.0219,0.9988,1.712,4.1978,6.2272,5.5745,0.1295,4.7141,1.4489,3.6603,8.6194,1.8032,0.8656,8.4234,0.374,9.0055,1.5775,1.2203,4.4522,5.3202,4.389,1.0895,1.2585,1.1795,2.4377,1.3668,3.6555,1.847,3.9933,2.9855,3.3083,2.9999,1.2265,6.0681,4.1022,3.5979,0.958,4.7763,1.4569,3.5235,1.6049,7.009,1.7608,1.551,3.5795,2.3795,0.7847,7.6036,5.9557,1.1882,7.3763,5.135,2.3228,0.7326,1.9616,6.5536,1.119,3.434,0.0056,0.5037,4.1166,7.3581,1.5864,7.0658,9.4756,8.7766,1.5078,1.4975,5.4116,0.0116,0.0015,1.4943,6.7427,0.0117,5.633,3.3094,4.4368,0.0078,5.3899,2.1445,8.6298,1.9294,4.5836,3.8876,4.3235,2.4027,6.0595,1.1584,0.6417,3.9741,0.3392,0.9676,10.2462,1.6989,2.1255,4.7886,5.3932,1.0749,1.0496,3.974,0.1736,0.0161,1.9334,2.1841,9.8343,0.2489,1.9617,6.5737,0.0069,0.7354,6.892,0.0052,0.001,6.9496,1.8815,7.9831,7.0002,0.0396,2.1669,0.0082,1.524,2.6626,2.5161,5.5219,13.1771,1.2893,3.7152,0.0132,0.0007,9.0039,5.4028,0.0068,6.3695,0.47,2.8143,2.0466,1.8591,0.6537,1.3414,1.0684,2.7158,0.0043,3.3411,6.6682,2.7863,2.7171,3.9558,5.5633,3.9828,6.0989,0.0059,0.001,2.2447,6.7273,0.2803,5.1146,4.1965,7.6187,5.4617,3.6947,2.4827,0.8925,3.0938,5.5161,0.0261,4.1351,1.025,3.5473,2.8996,0.3755,2.5057,0.9136,1.7403,4.9689,7.36,1.2171,3.7469,2.8758,1.637,6.1128,1.2219,5.5076,0.0183,0.0033,8.0267,0.1533,3.3415,1.8464,5.6,10.1215,0.123,0.9623,3.0816,3.5728,0.2701,0.0167,1.2887,1.1184,3.1343,6.1984,4.1129,0.6069,6.3231,5.3522,1.3443,8.1839,2.9715,1.8379,7.5943,2.6273,0.9847,1.2416,5.1623,2.4599,1.3276,0.0103,0.1642,3.7002,3.0823,0.8478,0.0002,0.5033,0.308,2.3673,0.0151,0.3233,0.202,1.6544,1.4362,2.2839,2.8576,12.0989,0.3379,3.6748,5.4762,4.6604,1.0284,0.4859,6.7245,0.3339,2.3454,2.9076,2.396,0.6965,2.8448,0.0064,1.5826,1.997,1.1448,3.8312,1.1052,1.3321,3.2989,5.2751,4.9125,0.8784,1.1344,5.8252,1.6706,3.2199,0.0035,0.7827,4.7721,2.3397,3.5315,2.5543,0.8312,0.004,3.6722,3.9757,0.5552,1.6564,0.9777,0.0115,1.6737,5.1624,2.1319,0.3082,5.1367,0.0466,6.04,0.8148,0.5548,0.2969,7.6462,0.5729,0.3668,0.0257,3.1543,2.6103,1.9597,2.8183,0.7171,0.3628,0.2149,0.009,1.7176,2.3703,3.5573,4.4865,0.2128,3.3858,0.0162,0.0435,0.003,1.8916,1.0564,2.0502,1.5483,2.5783,1.6497,3.6818,5.3317,0.2735,1.4634,6.0331,0.2166,1.465,9.3656,1.5775,5.3114,5.2652,5.1706,5.8189,0.3249,6.0963,2.9188,0.7918,3.5056,11.9611,0.0307,6.0788,5.5247,1.8785,3.1153,0.9185,2.4302,0.0051,4.354,7.3633,7.781,4.5488,3.2183,1.0895,4.3101,3.3217,8.6911,4.8313,8.2202,1.9204,5.3428,9.9691,0.0775,2.5886,8.2267,4.8065,7.3426,3.9515,1.3009,3.2892,6.5353,6.519,1.1412,0.4274,0.0025,0.0007,1.3924,8.9445,1.8078,0.4446,2.9889,5.2277,6.0285,3.928,0.9463,1.3606,7.8873,0.6931,4.613,5.6647,0.8919,5.7724,3.212,8.4768,0.0614,10.6902,3.0167,4.1911,0.0797,6.3938,0.9155,9.4963,3.9037,6.1316,2.9053,2.8113,3.59,1.0716,0.9872,1.9371,1.4292,2.4018,7.2649,0.6722,1.1972,1.6863,2.5925,3.2898,1.9194,6.1878,0.0217,0.0011,2.2806,7.5505,0.0622,0.0072,0.2311,0.7768,6.4328,4.5684,4.6937,1.4376,1.2636,0.7761,0.0122,5.2061,3.362,6.6922,1.71,5.9211,0.0032,5.3405,0.024,1.2294,4.2925,3.7293,0.6351,2.0708,4.8573,3.4798,6.8606,2.8273,6.6003,4.9935,0.1432,2.3402,2.3438,6.6972,5.656,0.0002,4.3759,0.3065,0.3428,2.482,4.211,5.4977,2.2269,1.7932,5.7763,0.004,7.0062,0.0115,1.2719,4.4451,2.8532,2.317,1.6961,5.8602,0.2413,0.0022,0.4021,5.9771,1.9248,2.474,1.04,6.6578,3.9416,3.6596,6.6608,8.794,0.0029,5.0538,2.1933,1.1039,1.818,4.3655,1.06,1.8606,6.0258,8.2101,0.7305,0.9048,2.6251,7.8211,1.1978,0.5543,2.7158,0.0043,1.8828,5.8597,6.0495,2.3588,4.3091,2.7716,5.2534,2.4234,1.5493,1.2051,4.0415,4.0119,0.0016,0.027,0.0356,0.2529,0.0046,0.0006,1.1898,0.8664,2.4311,5.3701,2.9069,5.8931,0.0089,3.5526,5.3904,4.6752,10.0706,2.463,1.8118,2.591,1.6188,0.0047,6.268,3.9847,2.338,6.4254,0.0475,1.73,2.406,2.5068,4.6051,5.4691,0.5403,2.5397,6.0763,1.1285,2.8332,1.5925,2.6437,1.8722,3.286,5.1893,1.3133,2.9332,1.321,6.1787,1.8358,1.2653,3.0704,0.0055,2.4817,2.2341,3.5104,3.401,1.3124,3.8583,0.9474,2.3627,1.1314,3.9499,6.9915,0.0117,0.9484,7.5589,5.0163,1.963,1.9278,3.757,6.4342,2.1013,2.6115,2.9079,1.9417,2.7001,1.2365,0.3027,7.4302,2.1877,6.8611,1.7759,1.2637,5.1261,1.3173,4.0271,3.278,3.4019,6.4351,6.3054,9.8158,1.2742,2.6377,5.1551,0.177,4.4508,3.6747,8.547,3.0642,10.7867,0.4525,1.8984,3.362,5.1436,5.3684,1.0323,1.0719,0.6229,0.0088,3.5509,1.922,2.0338,3.8991,0.4204,0.0041,4.3071,2.063,2.2806,5.6311,4.2535,0.7143,8.9027,0.0121,0.0008,2.5226]}

Two tank\u014dbon volumes","text":"A manga adaptation is illustrated by < unk > Araki and was serialized in ASCII Media Works'magazine Dengeki Daioh between the November 2006 and August 2008 issues in Japan. Two tank\u014dbon volumes were published in March and August 2007, published by Shueisha and reissued in January 2008 by Media Factory. A Japanese Blu-ray and DVD was released by Natsume on October 11, 2008.\nShuichi is a 15-year-old Japanese boy who enjoys playing the piano. His family moved to the American mainland from Osaka in September 2003 and returned to Japan for the summer holiday. When his trip ends up being delayed because of his mother's work, he goes to Japan with his father, who is an aspiring piano artist. Upon arrival, he receives an unexpected visit from the man, an acquaintance, whose name is Sonoha. He is a girl with short golden hair who is a major fan of Shuichi and is determined to see her favorite band in concert.\nSonoha, with her father (an artist), lived in Shibuya and would often meet Shuichi and his family when they moved to a new location. One day their car broke down and they drove to a hotel to wait for the repair team.\nAs Sonoha looked into the hotel room, she was suddenly confronted by what looked like a ghost because the door was tightly closed.\nA little later, Sonoha had a dream in which she encountered the ghost of a little girl wearing a white dress. Because of this, she thought that it was Shuichi's dead sister who was in her dreams. Then the little girl told her, \"Don't cry. I want to come with you to the world that you live in.\" To which Sonoha replied, \"That world is also my home. I cannot have only one home.\"\nA year later, while Shuichi is at the piano, he is visited by Sonoha looking very sad. She tells him about her dream and how she wanted to have a real life with him. But before she could say anything more, Sonoha's father suddenly appeared. Before he could say anything, she told him that she wanted to visit her sister, who was also suffering from leukemia. Shuichi did not want to tell her that his sister was still alive but begged for her to tell him. Sonoha tried again to explain things but the father's voice was not heard. Sonoha wanted to tell Shuichi that it would be too late, that her sister had already died. The next day, Sonoha's father left with her, but just before she was about to leave, Shuichi rushed to meet her. He said that he was sorry to have changed his mind.

The","text":"In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The new navy commander, Admiral Wilhelm D\u00f6nitz, wanted Dvina, as well as the Baltic coast of Russia, covered to prevent a resurgence of the Red forces. The main task of the 4th Panzer Group was to secure the port, and the 2nd Guards Amphibious Corps was sent to the coast to drive forces defending it. This division did not arrive until the end of October, and when it did the situation had degenerated, so that the Russian navy had no more than a few torpedo boats and a few destroyers remaining. The troops also had little ammunition, and the landing beach, on Raudla, was under continuous attack. On that evening, Dvina was attacked by German troops on Raudla. The landing beaches, on the island of Raudla, were captured, and the remaining Russian troops retreated in confusion. The Germans then moved inland to capture the city of Raudla itself, which, on the evening of the 28th, was captured by the Germans. After the battle had finished and the battle honour had been awarded, Dvina and Raudla received a new name: Leningrad, the future capital of Russian Federation, and Viborg, the new name of the present-day Danish city of Viborg. On 30 September, the Battle of Raudla was declared a world war II \"World War One\" victory by the Soviet Union.\nAfter being captured, the military administration of the city of Raudla was handed over to Allied-occupied Latvia. The city lost much of its value due to the destruction of the city that followed the war. Later on, the remnants of the city's railway station, church and monastery were destroyed by the war of 1948-1972. During the Soviet Union era, the city was renamed again \u2013 in 1954 it was renamed Viborg \u2013 and several buildings were built along the shoreline. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city returned to its traditional name. Nowadays, the town of Raudla on the island of Raudla is a fishing village. The town has changed little since World War II. In 2001, the city of Raudla was incorporated into the city of Raudla. The first settlement was established on the island of Raudla in the 18th century by Baltic Vikings. The city was briefly occupied by Sweden in 1807, following the defeat of the Russian Navy under Peter Petrov, Admiral of the Russian Navy. The small settlement on Raudla island was attacked by British, Danois and Norwegians in 1807, 1813, 1822 and 1828. Since 1831, Raudla has been part of Leningrad Oblast. During the occupation of the city by the Germans, it received German names: Raudla and Raudla (renamed to Leningrad ). When the city was returned to Soviet Russia in 1991, it was renamed to Raudla.

{"prompt":"The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic was reviewed by John Hutchings for the Folklore journal , the published arm of The Folklore Society .

He highlighted how the work would be of benefit to folklorists working on ritual and magic in Britain in general, and medieval Ireland in particular. In The National Review, the reviewer, David Kershaw, stated that the archaeology of magic has not yet developed into an empirical and comparative discipline, but one which is concerned with the ways people make and use magic. Hutchings wrote: \"I think we can safely say that there are at least two areas where he would benefit those working in the field. The first is in the study of ritual magic, perhaps most notably as a book on the magical practices of Anglo-Normans, in which he takes on a pioneering approach to the subject. The second is in the study of magical symbols and the relationship between magic and the material world as a whole, in particular such studies as on amulets and talismans.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien was a great fan of Sir Arthur Evans and wrote a letter to him in October, thanking him for an article published in the Gentleman's Magazine in which Evans reviewed a volume of Tolkien's short stories. Evans published this letter in The Letters of Arthur Evans ( ), a collection of Evans'private correspondence and letters. In The Letters of Arthur Evans:, John Flanagan states it does \"not appear on Evans's index of published material and, to my knowledge, has eluded the search of his library\". He adds that Evans had sent a copy of the article of to Tolkien.\nThe manuscript, or fragments thereof, are believed to have been in Evans'possession after his death, and were given by a friend. The first edition was published in by John Flanagan, a friend of Evans, and this edition has received little subsequent attention. The book is divided into two parts, based on where the text begins and where it breaks off. For example, Part 1 contains the text from the first of the four sections of the book, in which Evans focuses on the study of magic from the point of view of Christian morality. After a brief introduction, Evans describes in the text what the Roman Catholic Church claims are the seven principal tenets of magic, but does not give an account of those tenets in the book's original form.\nTolkien's review was published with a biographical note in The Letters of Arthur Evans: The Letters of Arthur Evans, edited by John Flanagan A personal letter was sent to Tolkien on 30 April, after his return to England, and it was received on 8 May The letter begins with a lengthy and warm introduction, and is followed by what are presumably his thoughts on the value of Evans's articles, although it is not clear if he did read the articles or not. Evans was also a supporter of Irish republicanism, and Tolkien used the correspondence as a way to encourage his fellow British Irish to support the Irish government during the Irish famine.\nIn another letter, Tolkien wrote that he had asked Evans for a \"copy of the manuscript of his book on the Anglo-Norman religion, [...] it would serve a great purpose for students, and would save so much uninteresting parchment paper.\"","token_len":656,"entropy":[12.0723,1.3152,0.631,8.4123,2.0068,5.9438,5.4958,6.3609,0.9736,4.731,8.6256,1.2924,4.4285,0.9318,8.8772,0.4474,4.4096,1.7156,3.3352,8.3546,9.9179,0.3254,3.0247,2.0229,0.1149,1.6213,1.6134,2.7548,7.3161,3.8047,1.2487,5.257,6.2046,1.9599,3.8984,3.6834,0.191,4.5472,1.3788,0.0742,4.6743,1.7608,2.8929,0.48,0.2212,2.3123,4.1089,3.5841,4.4699,1.333,0.7385,5.8997,3.2148,0.5812,0.0039,0.2688,3.7041,4.3758,8.029,4.99,0.6135,3.5464,3.9048,2.7799,3.8245,8.7291,0.2444,0.1745,4.5919,0.8214,1.3426,5.9907,0.0816,0.6785,2.0011,4.1422,3.6157,1.905,4.9374,1.5697,2.0641,5.3015,4.5017,6.3446,4.7959,1.1814,1.1414,6.6887,2.0137,2.2283,5.3525,0.1904,1.2675,5.0846,5.1346,5.2179,2.3345,1.0248,0.4242,0.8044,8.7388,0.0029,3.324,0.8032,1.2717,3.6093,2.2831,2.9473,2.1086,3.2421,0.6116,0.2555,2.8277,1.3707,4.552,0.1569,1.3393,3.5863,2.2022,7.6351,3.9208,6.0942,9.0762,3.3109,1.6101,1.2263,0.8698,2.2534,1.6478,0.2207,0.3118,2.1457,1.0173,3.2739,0.0354,2.0489,2.3896,1.3994,6.4406,3.7059,2.5873,3.9061,1.3068,7.1732,1.7117,1.3585,5.4431,2.9601,0.1888,5.2084,0.078,7.1089,0.0972,1.7237,4.0659,1.0298,1.3225,4.5084,2.726,1.9476,7.3534,5.2439,0.8549,0.9449,2.106,1.0627,1.3024,0.6838,0.3989,0.6007,0.516,1.022,0.0273,4.5539,5.5518,1.1757,2.3429,4.5002,0.47,1.8457,0.2146,1.9783,5.8649,0.2757,4.654,0.9065,0.1337,1.5135,1.8926,4.5375,7.8908,5.6705,0.0919,7.7941,9.2889,0.069,0.0002,0.9165,5.4419,0.1199,0.0006,1.5141,3.8927,12.4798,2.1345,4.7157,0.1822,2.2573,1.2668,3.6593,3.2413,1.7505,3.5322,4.3921,0.0559,5.4163,1.4607,8.8225,2.1661,4.913,2.2814,5.4271,0.279,0.7745,1.3587,5.0926,2.3333,10.4812,0.0982,0.0858,5.3048,2.6784,3.714,0.3315,1.1793,7.0504,0.2657,2.0727,1.369,3.2122,3.5827,7.3196,2.5891,5.873,0.4475,4.7507,0.0654,5.3118,0.6687,0.8579,1.932,5.5483,3.4458,0.6375,0.9705,2.3171,4.7368,0.2083,2.6198,0.2619,2.5596,13.3676,2.3702,2.1536,0.0909,6.6712,1.0499,16.9655,2.5841,3.1951,2.1773,1.4945,2.2401,2.4112,0.6593,0.0967,0.0446,0.008,9.2474,3.7611,10.2914,0.3576,4.5294,6.3372,7.8951,5.0911,1.1462,2.0727,6.1513,5.4502,1.1491,5.2227,1.6111,5.7737,3.0129,4.243,3.4367,3.8114,1.2646,0.7257,0.074,2.7003,11.1492,0.0672,2.0155,5.9266,1.6072,3.8401,3.6399,2.0954,2.5236,2.3212,1.1138,2.0252,2.8692,5.0771,2.2768,1.8906,0.174,1.2307,4.2131,5.9048,9.0965,5.2859,3.4199,1.9046,2.356,5.8059,3.9371,5.5951,5.9133,3.2718,0.0996,2.5655,4.8437,0.063,0.8655,0.2849,3.885,4.6005,0.5054,15.6467,0.8237,3.6268,1.6477,0.1658,1.6478,1.3832,3.2451,4.4851,3.7124,3.0085,1.9378,2.8687,1.9775,4.3769,2.8887,2.332,1.1353,0.3365,9.4031,4.9833,3.0124,0.0002,1.4483,2.3262,4.0923,0.1652,1.2165,1.7717,1.8685,4.9108,2.0485,3.0214,5.7552,4.4605,8.175,0.5531,0.3737,1.9023,4.4208,1.8304,3.9589,0.0952,1.5113,0.5375,0.8057,6.281,0.2063,9.5977,1.5999,2.544,5.3806,0.6945,4.118,0.7438,7.0248,2.6447,0.793,5.3271,2.4372,0.1557,6.848,1.0144,2.306,1.4402,2.1319,2.153,1.0915,1.9228,4.967,0.6239,2.4566,5.3026,1.499,0.7094,1.9953,1.0182,3.7134,0.2643,1.7314,7.5953,0.3649,0.9584,6.6757,0.0355,1.3568,4.9041,0.9134,1.9189,0.0186,0.0119,0.002,8.0864,5.3734,0.8145,5.6081,3.7996,1.3458,1.9046,1.4445,1.4508,3.6249,4.2719,3.7763,2.8758,2.241,2.4118,8.1794,1.4816,0.5739,7.165,4.2325,0.8983,4.8598,4.1712,4.5341,0.1051,2.717,1.1909,3.625,3.0934,0.0792,3.1414,2.5095,2.619,0.0908,4.0145,2.4992,2.1737,1.8398,2.1062,4.1041,4.6402,2.1491,0.2341,2.0294,6.1357,0.0077,1.1928,6.6864,3.8629,2.3068,5.2178,1.7792,8.0163,0.1217,1.4844,2.3519,1.3647,2.2986,0.0376,0.0512,0.0054,3.079,2.3623,1.9216,0.1425,0.0604,0.013,1.3414,2.9874,0.0422,2.0382,1.9602,0.0001,7.605,5.9937,2.0567,3.1226,1.4392,0.4376,4.2732,2.8413,4.067,2.8798,1.6538,6.7721,2.1524,5.9979,0.9338,0.9442,1.5389,2.4576,2.1914,1.2197,3.1407,3.6535,3.746,0.865,7.771,2.8048,6.0691,1.2174,1.1475,4.0535,3.3884,7.4779,2.6609,1.5991,2.6432,2.8038,1.4027,0.1014,5.9998,4.0636,4.3885,3.3848,4.3012,0.3532,0.8263,7.2014,0.1099,9.2899,1.5533,4.6044,2.1764,5.5403,2.1255,0.8856,1.3047,1.0638,1.972,1.3602,4.6775,4.8417,1.853,3.8841,1.971,0.9783,0.1899,3.6011,3.4835,2.9639,3.7808,4.4789,0.0452,5.4718,3.3164,2.2014,0.9913,0.9744,6.0524,6.248,2.058,6.0975,2.1231,0.7563,3.0291,0.4513,4.3764,1.8209,3.745,4.5931,4.9326,3.5426,2.4659,1.2582,1.8487,4.7108,2.7768,0.2932,3.2665,5.9065,0.9886,1.394,2.3813,5.4622,1.7535,1.0615,2.4518,3.0221,1.2865,1.5661,1.4852,4.7474,1.5549,2.8356,1.7107,3.7146,5.0331,0.4353,1.2591,2.9274,1.9531,2.3525,2.6556,1.9824,1.2315,5.3957,0.0405,4.5259,0.0207,3.1003,2.2142,13.1843,3.6354,2.5033,5.2384,3.6342,2.504,0.8102,1.8527,7.8217,3.4025,2.1618,2.2437,5.5775,6.1523,1.3297,8.3874,3.8807,6.8478,3.9566,2.9646]}
{"prompt":"In The General in His Labyrinth , Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez voices his political views through the character of the General . For example , Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds","text":"In The General in His Labyrinth, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez voices his political views through the character of the General. For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the radio call, he is saying \u201c that the revolution can take place only if it is born of the people and not from outside ; \u201d the revolution can only happen when the citizen is conscious of what needs to be done, \u201c if not from outside, at least from one side ; \u201d and so on. We understand that the leader is saying that the revolution comes from within the country itself -and not from outside, a foreign power-to be sustained in the long term, so that it will not be possible for it to be carried out by an individual. This way, the General highlights this point with political discourse and shows us that in order for the revolution to work correctly, it must come not from outside but from within, so that it will also not be possible for a force that does not emanate from the citizen itself to take hold.\nIn his Labyrinth The General is also capable of creating another metaphor to reflect a historical theme ; thus he uses another metaphysical device. \u201cThe labyrinth, \u201d said the General, \u201c is our national fate. A labyrinthian path is the destiny of all free peoples, a path so complicated that they can be lost forever.\u201d One way of interpreting this metaphorical device is that, in this case, it is said that history repeats itself (the fate of all free countries -and of the citizen- is to be lost when the political system goes wrong), so our fate is that of being lost, we must therefore follow the path correctly and follow its signs ( the signs of a new life on the other side of the maze). For more on the theme of labyrinths and the fate it has in human history, see the text The Labyrinth of the Ancients written by the philosopher Plato.\nIn the last scene of The general in His Labyrinth, the character Alvarez Borland expresses some beliefs and points of view about some of the political institutions of Venezuela through a discussion with the General. Although it comes from a foreign nation, since the character represents the foreign diplomats, this discussion also reflects important issues that the local government needs to address. It is very clear, through this discourse, that some questions concerning our country are still unresolved, such as the problem of the government\u2019s responsibility in the social policies it performs for the population, the lack of transparency in the government, the bureaucracy, etc. With this discussion we understand that, at the end, the General seems to admit that he has an idea of what the local government should try in order to solve some of the social problems that many people have to fight everyday, but he states that these are the problems that should be focused on, and then a small conflict is created.\nIn The general in His Labyrinth one of the characters that is constantly present throughout the novel's main narrative is the General. It is noteworthy that the narrator expresses a relationship of friendship with the General, which is marked by his frequent use of this character's dialogs to comment on the things that happen to the novel and to the characters it features.","token_len":656,"entropy":[5.5733,8.5091,5.895,4.742,10.1605,2.1648,10.9599,0.1804,1.3832,0.0803,0.0254,0.0003,9.7959,1.7574,7.0482,1.6951,3.7587,1.8429,6.5635,0.6736,2.2317,5.7659,1.4345,5.3047,1.6914,0.1004,11.1493,11.2462,4.9226,6.6315,0.1675,0.3567,3.4304,1.2458,7.1398,1.0438,1.4663,1.3149,8.3463,0.3298,1.5371,7.8048,2.112,1.7103,1.6116,1.8265,4.2041,11.9357,7.9669,6.8077,1.5013,6.2169,4.5747,3.9083,0.3209,1.208,1.4879,2.5093,1.4066,6.8247,1.3433,1.3021,1.9728,2.5972,1.1976,1.9411,3.0241,9.3322,3.0429,5.1624,3.6568,2.1603,1.4891,1.1005,2.5306,2.3131,0.9075,7.8862,1.9985,4.3257,0.3423,3.808,5.8694,0.1661,0.1078,0.1013,1.88,3.5365,3.2575,4.8863,5.0417,2.3222,0.8632,0.7834,4.5354,0.1014,0.5531,5.5315,2.1634,4.1841,0.3357,0.1799,1.5141,3.291,0.5172,0.3615,4.6098,5.1448,1.0864,1.4605,7.2192,2.1707,4.7646,1.2704,1.1742,0.721,6.2193,1.0883,1.9132,2.3426,4.2811,3.8016,6.2903,5.7142,2.4964,0.5281,0.3977,2.2876,5.7889,5.8167,1.2539,6.0967,6.6742,3.0841,9.1061,2.3897,1.1694,5.8159,2.1579,2.0144,3.7311,0.3025,1.7288,2.2061,1.9715,1.41,5.6311,1.8339,2.2591,0.0577,2.2475,3.7357,0.3053,1.3605,3.5889,2.8605,1.7854,2.9283,5.1828,0.94,1.3143,2.6107,10.0953,4.4297,2.0522,3.5983,7.3572,5.7097,2.2483,3.9644,2.4795,0.8969,3.3724,2.624,1.1963,0.793,0.9198,0.0745,3.2068,5.8528,0.4419,0.876,0.6292,3.8284,5.6532,0.219,0.4766,0.9995,0.0841,0.5847,2.3578,3.5053,0.0499,0.9463,1.6483,4.8967,3.8136,0.5449,0.8715,0.366,3.2126,5.8704,2.78,2.5656,0.0123,7.1753,0.0061,0.0797,1.6044,5.0493,4.4152,0.3292,3.6898,3.7567,1.6632,1.4657,5.55,3.0618,5.2547,5.6331,0.4236,2.5528,2.4706,6.5898,0.0179,4.1021,6.624,7.04,3.4385,5.094,4.3409,5.4258,5.4056,7.2981,6.7171,2.3716,3.268,6.1565,8.8169,5.1519,2.7912,8.4155,3.4436,5.6079,8.5286,2.6335,5.2598,1.2551,6.9797,1.4237,0.8053,0.2435,1.1402,1.6635,0.909,6.0903,6.5009,8.5011,0.9379,4.8415,1.8845,9.6743,4.7463,1.7574,1.7694,5.5397,0.0961,1.7682,7.9945,1.9973,1.5919,3.8621,0.4213,5.5708,5.39,0.4341,4.515,2.6125,3.3666,4.7535,2.9287,0.5639,5.2505,1.6136,5.4461,3.1496,1.4986,4.1481,0.8936,5.2488,0.3299,4.5958,0.2833,1.3464,3.6712,1.6964,3.1637,3.1299,0.0378,1.3095,0.8962,6.231,0.7315,6.7674,4.8499,0.0354,5.3947,3.128,6.9604,0.0826,2.2921,0.4901,5.1643,4.799,2.4728,3.28,1.7219,6.3886,4.0344,1.806,4.1033,0.5729,5.8841,6.0999,1.3158,5.1127,2.2041,5.1002,3.9077,2.02,3.0194,7.0995,3.959,0.839,3.8205,0.4528,5.6608,1.6328,2.5666,5.7086,2.1828,5.9879,3.6838,0.9717,0.6038,10.1236,2.2727,3.6084,3.6503,6.9462,3.2329,7.0019,4.7748,0.7098,2.7991,3.7194,4.0825,5.7325,1.1354,2.433,0.1988,1.2582,0.6054,3.7323,1.6048,4.6599,5.6944,1.3417,1.6487,5.8463,0.4107,3.1717,1.4623,2.0713,1.4029,6.1935,9.5933,2.7756,2.4556,6.5875,0.4112,0.4928,0.2681,2.2403,5.7017,3.9613,1.2906,2.1054,1.3873,7.1404,6.351,0.2244,3.0722,3.923,5.4014,0.8853,0.4737,2.1472,1.6307,4.2505,5.3686,1.0293,1.8472,7.0567,3.8079,1.9737,0.0005,0.6909,2.0783,4.0794,8.9812,0.1904,0.0011,3.8862,4.68,7.4515,3.0676,6.192,6.98,0.0968,2.3544,5.4179,1.1102,0.2809,3.3556,3.7856,1.9237,3.8147,6.5835,2.8842,5.3152,1.3068,1.2252,1.1744,0.8949,5.0856,3.3094,7.0477,1.0275,1.6606,5.7533,4.4978,0.4015,6.7653,1.3949,3.5889,5.8607,1.2123,3.9126,11.1841,1.7321,3.1353,3.5278,3.8141,3.1849,6.6546,2.6382,2.3389,2.3279,6.4324,2.403,3.6656,0.0442,1.3732,0.9907,3.5545,0.8952,4.7984,2.6209,3.5477,6.8469,2.541,5.053,0.2522,0.0737,4.7947,5.1995,3.7821,5.7796,2.6055,1.7904,4.0923,2.2822,1.6469,3.5177,0.0075,1.1856,5.8725,0.0807,1.7478,4.3096,15.6655,7.6363,5.5907,4.7182,3.2135,1.3742,6.082,5.4478,4.9115,6.177,4.7856,0.6249,3.6653,1.5349,2.051,4.2398,0.0083,3.2,0.9451,0.8245,2.8784,1.7477,1.2072,6.6359,1.1484,2.6147,0.1754,6.6227,1.2305,3.4481,3.5793,4.8018,0.2699,3.1336,3.8314,0.639,1.2395,2.5443,0.9863,2.0084,5.876,0.2449,5.994,0.283,1.7646,1.8586,4.0558,3.0967,1.7338,1.2224,1.8051,6.082,0.3173,1.2532,5.3761,4.8745,0.6439,0.0608,1.9502,3.2602,0.4566,0.8592,3.5356,0.1929,1.5764,5.4732,1.2776,1.8143,4.7432,6.8675,7.5072,2.0051,2.4169,1.6748,6.0039,0.3941,4.5671,2.205,2.9962,1.4112,0.5917,4.4297,0.2507,7.8959,0.155,2.0454,1.6135,5.2078,5.9793,5.3909,7.5974,2.0335,2.7274,1.6412,1.6077,1.6364,1.8247,2.523,0.6364,0.0249,0.0003,7.8361,2.2779,0.0943,3.78,5.2112,2.0275,6.0408,3.397,4.0662,0.2467,3.7943,5.8188,4.2817,1.9606,0.2926,0.9797,1.497,1.1275,3.5661,0.311,7.1987,0.2758,1.4916,4.7593,5.5034,2.0859,7.3841,3.1711,2.4229,1.0235,0.6653,0.6678,1.4486,2.719,1.1174,6.6901,0.2152,2.8039,5.7423,3.0619,0.0155,4.0411,1.8334,2.2912,7.0362,5.5352,3.2418,5.8929,0.1989,1.32,5.4952,0.5629,2.5937,1.5984,1.6583,8.3713,2.8923,1.6153,3.9762,2.4716,6.251,5.4227,0.526]}
{"prompt":"In the late 17th century the small population of Ch 'ol Maya in southern Pet\u00e9n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz , where the people were absorbed into the Q 'eqchi ' population","text":"In the late 17th century the small population of Ch 'ol Maya in southern Pet\u00e9n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q 'eqchi'population.\nThe Nahuatl -Spaniard wars of the 16th century left some of their homes in ruins, as well as the Mayan language as well as their traditions.\nIn the early 18th the Spanish colonists expelled the Maya from their homes. The Mayas had left most of the villages behind since they were assimilated in the area, some of their homes were still standing, but their languages were not.\nThe Mayan languages had vanished along with their culture in the early 20th century as the Spanish colonists exterminated all Mayan people. Because of poverty and the lack of education, the Spanish government deported them, and many of the indigenous were forced to leave home and become street vendors. A few of the families were given a few hectares of land to cultivate, but the government destroyed the fields and the families had to beg for food.\nThis situation continued in the 20th and 21st century. From to the Maya still struggled to survive.\nThe Mayas were classified as having a low degree of literacy. In the 21st century the Maya have found a new source of income in the tourism industry which continues to benefit the Mayan people.\nIn the past the Maya were farmers, mainly growing maize, beans and squash. They raised small livestock for their own consumption as well as selling them on the markets.\nThe Maya were highly skilled with their handweavers, and had various weaving techniques which could be produced in different qualities of fabric.\nA fine, very white, linen fabric weaving can be woven on long narrow looms; the finished baskets are quite square.\nSome of these baskets were quite elaborate, and were used for various ceremonial purposes. In some areas of Guatemala and Belize, traditional Maya weaving continues to be practiced.\nMayan pottery includes a unique form of decoration. These artists carved the designs in the pottery with chalk which is the same technique they used to write their language, pictographic writing, with stylised lines and shapes.\nThese patterns are called Kamchilas and most people think it is a modern phenomenon. The Kamchilas date back to the time of the Toltecs. These pots are highly prized, and have been part of the ceremonies for generations, and are used in a wide variety of rituals. The people that live near the archaeological sites in Guatemala and Belize will continue to produce these, but many of the designs are being replaced with contemporary themes.\nThe Maya have also produced metalwork and many beautiful decorative pieces in wood, stone, jade, gold and ceramics. These are still produced by some of the families who live near the archaeological sites, but in other areas the traditions are falling out of practice.\nThe Mayan people have adopted the culture of other cultures, in some cases taking it to different extremes. The indigenous people of the Pacific south coast of Mexico also practiced the Mayan traditions.\nThey had elaborate religious ceremonies involving their dancers and drummers. Many of these traditions are still practiced in some areas.","token_len":657,"entropy":[2.6222,4.7182,5.7899,0.3776,0.3147,3.1497,6.959,5.9902,0.3361,6.7196,11.6043,5.8575,13.1289,2.6553,3.5164,11.3413,1.2292,4.059,8.0559,0.308,1.6756,6.4024,2.2077,2.2293,7.3142,2.3169,4.7005,6.2472,4.4569,1.5349,2.43,2.0447,3.7672,1.8406,6.7653,0.6709,0.6062,8.3616,7.8324,9.2184,7.9191,3.1731,11.7824,0.9071,2.2591,4.5607,5.9763,3.3849,0.0845,6.6019,11.0221,2.8154,2.805,9.6072,2.4429,0.8201,3.6609,0.2557,0.4653,4.9237,4.3273,1.5876,2.6911,6.6231,2.3234,3.1634,1.4755,4.0274,1.6964,0.0152,1.8209,8.5254,0.5786,4.4008,4.6936,3.3991,0.2002,2.6152,5.0147,1.0232,1.5777,2.6563,1.0699,2.0514,1.7014,0.0241,9.2405,3.6019,4.8411,5.0896,0.9751,3.2394,1.0299,1.5201,3.7422,2.5896,1.8576,4.09,3.4444,3.6104,4.6013,4.7693,0.064,2.0456,5.1112,2.909,6.6012,1.8522,1.4932,5.5031,0.0157,3.4736,0.9208,6.1245,2.2656,6.1767,1.2462,3.005,2.5668,1.166,3.3086,2.951,0.9839,2.2463,2.8725,4.5558,0.7819,1.8268,3.2402,0.7589,1.2637,2.076,0.9579,3.4575,3.8445,5.3382,5.4671,0.0548,1.6309,3.0701,3.2339,0.8051,2.5593,1.8573,0.0058,0.0366,3.5205,1.4961,2.0607,4.3279,8.4739,0.0205,3.2874,4.2202,0.188,3.2573,1.5506,7.1307,0.4584,7.9242,0.8554,2.5609,1.9345,0.0033,3.1738,0.9664,1.0411,4.1092,4.0954,4.4574,3.0621,3.4856,1.8406,2.8102,0.7969,0.9257,3.6646,6.3101,1.7619,0.2252,2.1371,6.2441,2.5776,3.5857,8.0366,3.7402,0.5523,5.1703,2.0372,1.5493,0.573,5.4009,1.7387,4.6493,2.59,4.1666,6.1824,0.4976,0.1441,2.0707,2.9466,1.395,1.288,1.8822,3.8358,4.7235,1.4657,4.4297,1.1316,2.8567,4.4447,4.2022,0.2673,6.1515,0.7268,1.6248,0.825,0.7404,4.6373,3.8427,2.9917,2.7459,0.4284,2.8701,0.0323,3.7965,0.4855,0.0015,1.8188,1.5332,5.4869,8.4069,2.0152,9.4653,6.2272,7.1238,0.9403,0.8566,1.4797,2.4216,1.4618,2.7334,1.9752,1.4314,7.6572,0.272,5.1073,1.5658,3.2979,5.3441,0.0078,0.9435,1.4626,2.7053,1.3129,3.9091,0.0015,0.0562,1.6084,1.7949,4.3615,4.7153,1.6302,2.0127,5.1254,0.0603,2.1528,3.6214,1.074,6.8394,0.5238,4.1305,5.481,0.2856,4.4116,1.02,2.8238,0.872,0.9933,0.4204,0.8549,2.431,0.8546,3.7082,2.7839,1.1072,2.1118,8.1489,1.4566,6.8737,7.2233,2.4511,1.2833,2.3877,0.992,4.7726,0.6637,2.3519,6.6299,4.5099,3.5711,3.0801,1.5669,2.0208,1.736,4.0173,0.8425,0.0755,3.8819,2.0705,3.2203,0.3632,2.7552,0.5141,1.1838,1.4115,2.0889,1.9075,4.5201,2.1456,4.1748,2.9574,4.5672,11.6583,3.6518,1.2913,2.1189,3.2723,6.9982,7.2967,1.9573,3.0962,3.6656,0.526,7.4999,1.4224,3.743,9.2175,3.0796,5.1138,0.636,1.0876,4.0983,7.2066,4.2166,5.3995,5.3531,3.0307,4.0164,3.5163,7.5137,5.0524,0.2874,2.1143,3.0929,5.9551,6.6328,7.6193,6.3775,2.3209,4.6952,11.3688,0.9725,5.962,7.364,1.779,1.1256,4.5997,0.9297,2.7746,2.3779,1.3885,5.8899,4.5571,0.9587,1.4865,2.0907,3.3992,1.6874,4.0134,4.9409,0.6482,0.6174,3.6197,2.6697,3.0326,1.957,4.4654,2.3792,4.4481,0.0022,1.251,6.2716,1.7909,2.6314,8.1171,0.7972,0.4787,1.385,0.7496,0.4503,3.2592,0.9143,6.9723,0.0217,7.2139,2.0926,4.6972,3.3939,0.0986,3.9414,1.7236,3.7584,8.6925,3.8279,3.1016,5.2601,2.9055,2.4322,4.197,0.0581,3.656,6.1131,4.7879,1.9768,4.6763,2.6134,4.2326,6.2685,0.474,1.3072,5.501,1.7852,5.6396,3.3481,7.4793,4.253,3.4212,0.8647,6.5705,5.9471,1.7774,2.382,2.1873,3.1782,0.3884,0.5601,4.2007,4.213,1.2836,4.1143,9.4992,6.3024,6.1408,3.3721,2.3737,6.5835,3.436,2.9107,3.245,0.4648,1.2062,5.9557,5.7296,0.6009,2.316,1.99,0.0967,0.0697,0.0486,6.654,0.306,0.2608,0.5609,3.1135,0.2071,0.6815,6.5998,2.2266,0.1469,1.84,4.0295,6.2131,2.218,5.5387,2.0102,2.3417,0.9066,3.1664,0.7866,5.9876,0.0112,1.0237,7.5667,2.9386,2.658,2.8021,1.814,1.4756,2.6744,1.6048,3.9023,2.0439,0.4287,0.005,3.4426,0.8516,2.6897,4.8461,4.9254,2.5197,2.894,1.2652,6.3176,0.8566,2.2459,1.162,0.8245,0.2013,0.0006,4.9623,5.5526,0.1466,4.9732,1.9984,6.1221,2.4178,3.3014,0.9334,0.7915,5.1086,1.031,5.5703,3.105,1.7351,5.0257,7.1567,0.8501,0.4016,1.6358,1.7664,2.3634,1.8393,4.1863,8.2499,3.9154,2.5442,5.3187,6.05,4.1875,2.9246,3.6314,7.8297,1.7852,1.9618,0.8261,7.2924,0.8611,0.6188,4.5695,1.2368,3.5681,0.0077,0.0001,0.241,2.6108,1.5137,3.6364,4.235,2.8376,4.15,0.5918,0.1023,6.0537,1.9263,1.6052,1.4735,0.3457,1.0985,0.0838,1.513,1.1567,3.925,5.3385,1.0822,1.9449,6.655,1.2615,6.959,2.2801,0.3055,8.3546,0.3374,0.4689,1.5043,1.9853,0.3123,1.8365,1.6791,5.1507,2.0653,5.411,0.2988,5.0416,2.1091,1.4432,4.5826,3.5211,0.5136,4.945,2.5248,1.3689,3.6882,6.1977,0.4653,2.0223,4.1235,1.7269,1.3219,1.2573,5.2641,6.9666,4.7608,0.9998,2.1225,4.5093,4.673,1.6892,1.7116,0.0212,4.2377,1.1797,0.7515,4.4461,3.5793,8.5621,4.5673,1.1049,5.2764,5.0473,7.9254,1.5141,6.5333,0.1733,0.9187,3.5457,0.7166,0.9567,4.4191,1.3312,0.5181,1.5888,1.3053,2.5785,1.0339,2.8579]}
{"prompt":"In June 1941 , JG 51 and the majority of the Luftwaffe were transferred to the Eastern Front in preparation for Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union . On the first day","text":"In June 1941, JG 51 and the majority of the Luftwaffe were transferred to the Eastern Front in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. On the first day, 17 Luftwaffe planes lost five aircraft and eight more were damaged, including four Ju-88 bombers. By the end of the month, the loss rate was up to almost 30 percent. By contrast, the Pz. IV suffered less than 20 percent casualties. The German ground forces suffered over 1,000 casualties in July in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. During the course of the conflict in July, German forces attacked Soviet forces across the Volga River and, despite losses from attacks by the Red Army, were still able to successfully advance to the Volga region. At the start of the battle, German casualties were about 1,300, including more than 600 dead. By the end of the month, the total number of Germans killed reached 8,300, including 3,500 dead. In Operation Nordwind, the Soviet military suffered over 1,300 German casualties against less than 200. By January 1942, the Soviet Union had established an air-controlled air base on the island of Vologda. Under the terms of the AngloSoviet Anglo-American Treaties concluded at Tehran in 1937, Britain, the United States and Australia were permitted to send air force officers and support to the Soviet Union as long as the United States Air Force was assigned to the Commonwealth of Independent States. The United States Air Forces in Asia, the South Pacific, and the United States Navy were given authorization for the same purposes.\nUnder this arrangement, three airfield bases of the KGB became operational in the Soviet Union during the summer of 1941: Kharkov, Novosibirsk, Krym and Belgorod-Belogorodskoe Airport  ; in the Russian SSR, a field of aviation equipment was established in Chita City; and in Persia, the United States Central Command established a facility at Narozheron in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas. Although most of the Soviet Union was occupied before the Armistice in June 1942, not until the invasion of the Soviet Union by the Soviet Union began in November is it considered that the German groundforce was defeated in the war on the Northern Front.\nIn September 1943, the German Air Force was reorganized to form the new Luftwaffe, which was commanded by Hermann G\u00f6ring.  The new Luftwaffe consisted of 3 army squadrons of the air forces, 7 air divisions and 3 air forces. In November 1943, in response to a request by the Allied High Command, the Luftwaffe received permission to operate an offensive in the Western Desert.\nIn September 1944, following the Normandy landings, Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of North Africa and Italy, and the Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic, the German Luftwaffe, under G\u00f6ring, was again organized into several separate airborne wings in the North Atlantic and European Continent and to the Eastern Front. However, it is known that the war ended with about 400,000 German soldiers killed or captured and about 60 percent of the initial German air force force.","token_len":657,"entropy":[7.8939,8.0533,0.2334,6.4399,5.2677,10.4875,4.2019,3.0123,7.5033,0.2015,1.0009,7.6374,0.0395,0.0075,0.0003,2.4637,4.2904,0.2511,1.0487,5.288,0.3499,2.9054,3.577,0.0883,3.5854,0.9707,0.0016,0.0,1.5454,1.7345,3.1667,0.1168,1.8801,1.7789,0.0523,0.8808,3.1159,2.7389,3.189,0.4104,2.32,7.3085,1.983,0.0078,0.0185,0.0152,3.4509,6.03,5.9024,2.0727,1.6959,4.6777,4.7199,1.4607,1.8189,2.2392,1.9537,3.191,6.7667,0.7782,2.6152,3.0466,0.7345,3.3145,1.2729,0.7799,0.0102,1.232,2.6628,0.38,1.607,5.5388,2.0169,1.175,4.9087,0.1219,5.6715,3.0708,1.1186,0.7019,2.7543,6.9017,0.025,0.8485,7.0188,2.2021,1.1788,6.4536,5.4245,4.5895,0.8215,2.9316,0.5133,2.851,1.1491,2.0116,3.9387,5.9787,0.5053,3.1469,4.8092,3.619,0.0794,0.9453,0.6521,2.1802,5.8651,6.1469,1.1848,3.1133,0.0387,5.555,5.1237,3.9663,10.4679,1.8699,3.623,0.3921,4.1228,0.0009,0.4168,3.7735,4.1815,5.1755,2.1143,3.4105,2.4011,4.794,4.2423,2.5426,5.4486,0.481,4.8792,0.0086,1.2608,1.8687,4.4838,3.8203,3.4353,3.882,6.0348,1.3704,1.4216,4.727,0.0254,0.5776,2.8226,3.9809,0.4553,0.0021,5.3808,4.4573,1.3013,0.5836,4.2429,0.0187,6.443,0.5316,4.167,0.5932,3.2625,0.0038,1.0701,3.7498,0.471,2.5042,6.0056,1.0258,3.2439,2.5868,0.1007,2.7335,1.2863,3.1902,3.6699,0.0173,3.9882,4.7183,1.1982,2.9109,0.752,0.3337,0.0132,0.6092,0.8583,0.1414,1.2993,3.5941,1.579,0.0334,2.8656,0.4422,7.4907,4.0289,1.0493,3.2688,1.3813,1.3126,4.0674,0.0165,2.4065,3.4804,2.9237,2.5203,8.3973,9.0295,6.2284,0.186,1.2187,4.0198,4.2281,2.9523,2.6346,1.7926,0.008,2.5371,3.1395,0.314,6.3517,6.1988,0.0203,2.4572,3.3968,2.6617,4.7602,0.5191,0.0526,1.0503,1.911,2.7753,1.2354,5.5619,2.4047,1.7831,4.5707,5.6386,1.9156,1.0888,2.3911,0.4083,4.646,0.1473,3.0418,4.6579,1.6197,1.2595,5.6099,0.98,4.083,0.007,0.4357,6.9717,11.7527,10.6218,0.0754,1.29,7.9228,0.1053,7.2851,3.2879,7.8113,0.8796,6.814,0.0888,5.0227,1.8251,2.6476,0.5449,0.0068,0.9619,3.1479,1.5305,4.3333,0.0808,4.2533,2.6327,3.5553,4.9323,1.1657,5.0098,2.765,1.1576,1.8602,1.319,3.7984,3.3667,0.0057,1.7598,3.9789,0.1796,7.8406,0.1363,1.77,7.1553,0.4114,1.0216,7.1773,1.0365,0.4818,0.0787,0.5414,1.6096,2.5838,0.0767,1.8468,3.8292,3.7185,6.3838,2.5184,2.3387,3.8259,0.2002,1.0265,1.027,0.665,4.9419,0.9079,4.7398,1.1066,3.5843,6.5346,2.5362,1.9594,5.7592,4.0546,0.5155,3.0159,12.0803,3.4214,0.6352,0.0724,6.3404,3.2024,4.2178,2.3949,4.3146,0.5818,10.648,5.9696,0.7788,1.5644,1.5983,1.7251,0.0536,3.4261,0.4255,3.179,0.1113,0.6693,3.1594,3.267,0.3884,1.9303,0.7635,3.8515,1.0073,0.021,0.0027,0.0002,0.2779,9.2145,3.7162,4.0199,5.0811,1.6264,0.0001,6.1509,7.7374,5.2257,0.9784,0.2161,7.956,11.4864,10.1925,13.5162,10.6605,4.0626,1.8782,5.5882,8.9584,2.8423,1.266,4.1742,5.856,1.8095,6.2403,4.14,1.1252,2.4744,1.7208,4.92,5.7509,5.3454,2.6717,0.3584,0.2938,8.8425,0.5597,1.6913,5.2333,0.3824,6.7891,0.8656,2.5586,0.919,4.5903,1.7876,5.8486,6.63,8.7437,5.4585,2.2498,1.3263,5.9391,3.9841,1.3426,0.0352,7.0298,0.2367,0.5294,0.559,4.858,4.5598,0.3569,0.2947,1.0131,2.4652,2.571,4.0479,6.1812,0.4376,6.8452,0.003,0.0001,2.5318,2.7359,3.24,0.0741,6.5884,5.8397,1.5106,4.5619,0.082,1.4799,0.9091,0.0059,2.6138,0.7978,2.7092,0.2615,3.7608,0.8212,2.9937,8.3627,2.0867,4.1463,1.9894,0.6836,5.8212,3.8916,9.6909,1.7232,4.9422,2.0099,0.7044,3.2396,5.0982,0.8965,7.1597,0.7375,0.3671,1.5874,2.3661,3.8972,3.1638,0.0962,0.8118,3.2049,2.5575,0.0946,2.2993,5.1697,0.3279,2.3861,3.8245,0.7627,5.0613,4.225,0.0029,0.0977,0.002,1.6774,1.6317,1.5023,3.5438,0.039,5.9315,0.0268,1.4314,0.0259,0.6991,7.7769,2.8126,2.0433,0.7322,0.0025,0.0091,0.0028,2.7565,0.0888,4.9501,9.6642,7.4075,0.0004,1.496,3.4196,5.769,2.9553,1.2893,4.834,1.4907,3.7718,1.2827,2.9792,1.7402,3.9405,0.7791,3.1852,3.1078,0.5931,0.0972,4.8426,2.1893,0.0026,2.3455,1.4754,1.7009,0.4917,3.5813,4.0906,0.0388,0.7751,0.4293,1.4531,0.0012,0.0159,0.0035,4.3443,3.057,0.7867,3.7966,5.3654,4.8422,2.9456,0.6517,3.8894,5.1719,1.2572,3.0704,1.9057,3.7131,0.4662,0.0796,4.878,0.6791,6.5804,2.2415,0.0006,0.406,5.9153,5.3489,0.3958,1.5205,1.135,3.3651,4.4163,0.3532,4.7111,0.1533,2.0121,6.5943,0.3725,1.7761,0.3935,3.0181,2.9311,0.9057,0.5545,1.7482,0.012,1.2132,2.774,0.7949,0.6285,2.3531,3.9668,0.0015,0.0201,0.0036,4.3597,1.8989,1.6891,0.0003,0.1735,1.4,4.8296,3.5189,2.4565,6.1431,4.2691,5.5962,5.3261,4.731,1.4784,4.7125,1.1362,2.3533,5.586,7.3143,4.4755,3.6173,2.7709,2.7592,1.1874,0.3636,5.2698,0.0116,3.5462,2.874,3.6861,0.1775,1.2769,6.2601,3.3787,1.7891,5.9405,4.0521,0.7842,0.0016,1.9617,2.4973,1.2219,2.0715,1.7743,3.325,2.4461,4.7359,2.9001,0.0584,0.438,8.1608,1.6196,3.958,0.2169,5.4602,1.5926]}
{"prompt":"Once in China , Butler was initially deployed at Tientsin .

He took part in the Battle of Tientsin on July 13, 1900 and in the subsequent < unk > Expedition, during which he was wounded in the leg. Butler then proceeded to Hong Kong for further medical treatment and then served as the first American commander of a British naval expeditionary force at the Battle of Tsushima on June 25, 1905. Shortly after, Butler was appointed to command all of the U.S. naval forces in South East Asia, and served until the end of World War I.\nIn January 1907, when US Secretary of the Navy Charles A.\nPierce was replaced by a new U.S. Secretary of the Navy, William F. Pepperell, Butler was recommended by Pepperell to succeed Pierce as commander in chief of U.S. operations in the South and West Seas. His first command was in the Far East, where he led the naval forces in South East Asia ( comprising a fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Charles L.\nMonsignori ) in a battle against the Japanese around Java, in 1908.\nThe United States were seeking to expand its influence and trade in Southeast Asia, and thus Butler's tenure in this position was controversial. The British government considered this expansion of U.S. influence to present a threat to British interests or to their alliance with the United States.\nIt is the perception that Japan had a number of secret programs including the development of sub-marines and ballistic missile technology. But Japanese officials, however, denied the existence of these programs, while the U. S. government was not inclined to prove its case. Japan's policy in Southeast Asia consisted of neutrality in the Western Pacific between 1903 and 1905. After World War I, Japan was able to expand its military and economic interests. The government of H\u014dgen Taik\u014d, especially the cabinet, which consisted of many experienced military men, had long favored military and economic intervention in Southeast Asia in order to promote the island nation's interests in this newly created colonial area.\nButler was appointed to command these operations on May 20, 1918, and served until the end of the war. His plans, however, did not go according to plan, as the Japanese, under the leadership of Yamamoto, the chief naval officer, managed to defeat the United States ( with Butler leading the expeditionary fleet from Tsingtao ) in a naval battle on the coast of the Japanese island of Yap on August 24, 1918. The US Navy, including those from the Pacific Fleet, as well as the military and intelligence organizations, lost a great number of men in this battle, as well as being severely hampered by their failure to recognize the location of the U.S. fleet on the island.\nButler received the highest U.S. military honour after this defeat, being awarded the Legion of Merit, as well as being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He also became a recipient of the Imperial Order of H\u014dmei, as well as being made an honorary member of the Society of East Asian War Veterans.\nButler is buried in the Mount Arlington cemetery in Washington, D.C.","token_len":658,"entropy":[3.9612,6.8763,0.4954,11.986,3.1553,6.4348,6.6445,3.8878,6.1399,5.4931,0.0083,3.4002,1.6731,5.0843,1.1949,0.0266,1.56,4.4427,0.0409,2.3965,0.1941,0.0194,2.7954,2.7203,3.7178,0.3755,6.2522,2.2265,3.8016,0.505,5.0152,14.4504,11.6428,7.3298,4.8296,6.6533,3.4935,4.4233,0.0872,0.335,1.5721,2.8172,1.5539,1.2645,2.6855,1.2947,2.1762,3.5414,5.2902,0.2426,4.825,0.0783,3.3286,4.1922,3.6874,0.29,2.1693,3.135,4.7083,0.8949,3.3809,2.9933,2.8928,4.4764,1.9645,2.7008,5.5996,3.9122,3.4108,5.181,0.2405,3.4695,1.7679,1.8677,0.0105,5.0267,1.4694,1.6066,2.3643,3.2695,0.0494,2.6188,0.2255,5.9373,1.0883,2.2201,1.0541,1.475,3.3698,1.8647,2.1395,5.504,2.3829,0.3935,2.91,0.0222,0.069,0.0535,2.7137,0.3869,0.9142,4.2111,4.4061,0.0548,1.7001,1.7731,2.9611,4.1048,2.3563,0.6059,0.009,1.2197,0.0012,0.2718,0.3919,2.2576,7.2649,4.2543,2.9032,0.299,5.0625,6.9337,2.5935,0.0045,2.9815,0.063,3.5133,3.3026,0.016,8.6792,4.694,4.9989,2.0605,6.9195,0.3527,4.2854,1.8148,5.2114,0.0021,0.0156,0.0161,2.8737,0.0532,1.1199,0.0562,1.0079,3.3648,3.216,0.017,8.0285,5.139,3.2984,0.0267,0.1999,0.4389,1.2551,8.6978,1.597,2.3448,0.0102,0.007,0.0006,0.5487,4.5321,2.4878,0.7195,4.0978,2.9873,0.1117,0.4033,2.6052,0.0016,0.0036,0.0157,4.8271,0.4638,1.6167,2.2309,5.155,2.5508,4.2111,0.417,5.426,3.3739,3.5062,1.0948,2.3901,1.9517,5.6061,0.0661,0.8423,0.9389,0.2054,3.278,0.941,4.1907,1.2235,1.6895,5.4389,1.806,0.0662,4.5207,12.1509,4.5116,3.0063,4.12,5.0382,1.3504,0.3669,0.0093,6.5638,0.3124,3.4585,3.3319,0.0601,2.9475,4.6595,7.2414,0.6845,11.3545,5.562,3.0123,3.9329,3.8905,1.6855,0.8354,0.6362,7.0147,7.759,1.6699,3.2451,5.8325,0.284,3.0031,3.1285,3.9243,0.0167,5.7898,6.6636,0.8226,3.6069,0.8014,3.1305,3.4492,5.6477,1.3911,3.0507,0.0191,1.441,1.321,5.416,2.2421,2.1982,4.9769,1.6242,3.4447,2.6966,0.74,5.1883,0.3289,2.7313,5.0621,2.5163,3.8247,4.0121,5.5876,1.937,2.8565,0.0006,0.0006,0.0484,1.0532,1.7337,8.5518,0.7133,0.9527,0.1178,3.3589,1.3779,6.3743,1.2424,3.9108,5.7275,0.2884,0.9013,0.7408,0.0369,0.6506,2.4957,4.5217,2.0233,4.8881,6.5951,0.6783,6.5348,2.6691,2.747,6.165,0.0062,5.837,5.2045,6.8546,1.6072,3.8155,0.0582,6.1742,0.8519,4.0754,0.0223,1.4788,6.4689,1.2327,3.0083,1.7291,4.9316,5.1736,1.9405,3.3338,2.8906,0.0811,3.6569,2.2805,0.661,0.0236,1.5239,0.2999,1.7854,4.6548,1.9171,2.0056,0.0007,6.9469,0.0182,0.8636,3.0206,4.1448,5.1779,0.0608,8.1714,3.4222,3.2017,0.7449,5.2645,1.5166,4.8281,2.8043,2.4533,0.0201,4.8913,0.3065,6.9835,2.2283,1.3276,6.6373,0.325,6.4995,11.1325,0.0916,2.3241,1.0709,4.7312,2.6054,0.0039,0.0861,0.1787,2.4596,2.4904,3.8182,0.0335,3.7512,0.2474,2.3826,2.5535,1.4415,3.2604,3.6925,2.7964,4.8203,1.2561,5.2167,6.8648,5.1306,10.1767,3.0237,0.7273,1.5397,7.1847,1.6881,4.3243,1.7851,4.7501,4.4625,0.1281,5.017,7.3904,2.0696,2.9728,0.4228,2.6484,3.8478,5.147,3.7234,2.9682,0.2409,4.9236,0.6203,2.1982,0.0573,3.5917,1.0718,0.0027,3.8543,2.0513,7.94,0.5526,0.2151,1.6816,1.9845,3.1672,6.2936,3.9942,6.0954,3.6914,0.1267,1.2252,3.5837,0.0067,1.4137,2.2562,1.2842,2.1289,6.58,3.0776,2.5163,2.443,3.3094,0.0148,4.5406,0.6239,1.3437,2.5776,1.5752,1.1994,0.086,0.0092,2.1911,0.2388,0.5746,3.193,7.5962,4.0775,1.4942,0.0164,2.4812,0.0418,2.0561,3.7165,0.0069,0.0908,2.0317,1.3917,1.9358,1.9503,5.4025,3.2681,1.4002,1.4107,0.0119,6.4159,0.5894,1.9781,4.0891,3.8669,4.9285,0.2457,0.6595,5.5457,0.1235,3.7366,0.8248,2.792,0.0047,5.7571,5.9208,7.4047,4.9719,0.7091,5.4068,1.6386,5.0017,5.3574,2.9982,11.6248,1.2404,0.3583,2.884,1.4972,1.5375,3.4598,0.5922,1.9895,2.7179,4.6316,0.0408,2.0026,3.7965,1.9927,0.1708,5.2969,4.2729,2.8411,2.2439,3.7479,0.0794,0.792,0.2879,2.2518,4.8792,2.049,2.4612,5.5768,5.035,3.4466,1.0471,2.3367,0.829,0.3568,6.8728,0.0467,0.0045,1.151,5.4263,2.4911,3.1204,4.003,1.5086,5.8131,3.5148,2.7509,3.0026,0.0033,2.2549,1.6996,2.3171,0.7739,1.5422,3.3796,0.9456,0.0134,7.6695,3.0157,5.8705,0.5494,3.9288,5.698,0.0637,6.4708,0.7537,5.4219,0.1702,0.8134,3.3453,0.0022,0.3621,0.0569,3.6069,3.8051,0.4483,2.3528,0.624,0.9819,1.7266,0.0074,4.558,1.7942,3.2636,7.0902,0.0011,0.2998,0.0033,2.4652,4.7247,5.1298,4.5137,2.9731,0.9288,2.2005,0.7287,0.2742,4.7396,0.0608,2.5486,0.0156,2.1212,3.8684,0.512,0.0081,3.4512,8.5841,0.0082,0.0209,0.608,0.2122,3.4197,0.0024,0.433,0.2304,0.8436,1.9272,2.3523,3.3566,1.5664,4.1996,0.022,0.3269,4.9796,4.5002,0.1016,7.5096,1.1009,7.5547,0.3867,1.0557,3.379,0.211,0.0029,2.911,5.5234,1.9485,0.6937,1.8358,0.0403,0.1398,5.8496,0.1359,7.1028,0.3204,4.0445,0.3266,0.5282,0.83,1.7496,0.0044,3.5953,2.8803,0.4798,1.428,5.8354,7.6068,3.1676,0.7296,1.5684,0.3273,0.636,0.0005,0.0641,0.5028]}
{"prompt":"The original stations on the Tunbridge Wells to Hastings section of the line are mostly in the Gothic or Italianate styles . These were designed by William Tress . Frant , Wadhurst , Witherenden ,","text":"The original stations on the Tunbridge Wells to Hastings section of the line are mostly in the Gothic or Italianate styles. These were designed by William Tress. Frant, Wadhurst, Witherenden, and Whitehead all contributed to the design of the new stations (the latter having designed the town's other stations ). As a result the stations in the east-west line are very similar, despite being built by three different companies.\nThe station was designed by Frant to resemble a gothic church. In its original form, the station platform was two stories wide and had a central portal and side galleries. The station was originally sited on Hastings Road, but over time, it has been moved to its current location on Great Western Lane where it is still being served by the GWR. In 1952, the ticket office moved to the new train shed. The station building is still in use today, although now as the Hastings station of the British Rail Coast Line.\nThe station is now designated a Grade I Listed Building by English Heritage. It is also the oldest operating station on the line and a former General Post Office.\nOn 11 May 2017, the station hosted the World Pride celebrations in Hastings, to coincide with the official opening of the new Brighton & Hove Street Station.\n\nStations since 2004\n\nThe station became part of the St Pancras International underground station following implementation of the St Pancras Tunnel project for the London Underground network on 11 February 2004. As of 2014, the station has the longest concourse at 5.9\u00a0m (18.0\u00a0ft) long in the London Underground. New waiting areas for both platforms were built in the same year. The new building has now become part of the St Pancras International Museum. The underground station has an open-access foyer.\nThe station is served by the Piccadilly (M60) Line. Access to both platforms from Piccadilly Line platforms is via the main entrance. Via the Piccadilly Line southbound platforms (the former entrance) has been taken over by the Royal Victoria Docks, with the platform closing to passengers from there. The Piccadilly Line southbound platforms are currently closed to passengers on Monday to Friday weekdays between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm (unless closed due to maintenance) and other times on major bank holidays. To avoid any disruption, passengers using Piccadilly Line trains should use exit 42 on the underground or take the Piccadilly Line, rather than the Southend (Victoria) tube station to get to the Southend ferry terminal. All Piccadilly Line trains now depart from Platform 1.\nThe North Dock service between London Docklands and Brighton is now served from this station.

{"prompt":"At 05 : 45 , Lieutenant @ - @ Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment received orders to move his 1st and 3rd Battalions to the west and support the 2nd Battalion","text":"At 05 : 45, Lieutenant @ - @ Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment received orders to move his 1st and 3rd Battalions to the west and support the 2nd Battalion with all their assets ( artillery, mortar, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft batteries, grenades, ammunition, food, blankets, tents, beds, medicine \u2026 ). By 06 : 00 the two battalions were out on patrol, at 06 : 30 the 3rd Battalion with the artillery and mortars and at 09 : 10 the 1st Battalion supported the troops from the 2nd Battalion who were going up the hill \u2026.\n[ \u2026 ]\nAt 13 : 30, the 26th Infantry Battalions of Sefik and Atik arrived. At 16 : 30 Captain @ - @ Mustafa \u00d6zen of the 6th Battalion and Captain @ - @ Ibrahim \u00dcnal of the 19th Battalion from the 27th Infantry Corps went in. By 18 : 00, Lieutenant @ - @ Mustafa Topcu of the 6th and Lieutenant @ - @ Hasan \u00c7im\u015fek of the 19th entered at the south flank of Liman. The situation on the flanks was taken into account and by 19 : 30 the 27th Battalions were out as well.\nDuring the second attack, the Turkish 27th Battalions made efforts to continue further into the west of the Liman, but the enemy troops kept pushing them back to the east. A few battalions succeeded to reach into their positions and take the village of Yeni\u015far to the west of Zula ( west side of the valley ) of the K\u0131z\u0131lba\u011f ( river ) which runs close to Yeni\u015far. The situation was not calm in the K\u0131z\u0131lba\u011f valley after the retreat from Yeni\u015far. Yeni\u015far village was attacked several times after the 27th came to its positions. The Turkish 27th Battalion got back on its feet at the night attack on 21 November.\nWhen the 27th Battalions went back to the first lines, it was a new battle front that was opened. The terrain of the first lines was narrow in places, surrounded by small mountains and valleys. The left side of the 27th Battalion took ground on the south side of the K\u0131z\u0131lba\u011f ( river ) that runs close to Yeni\u015far. The front was also extended in the northern part towards Zula. The position was also surrounded by high and rocky ridges and slopes in front and the position was exposed in places.\nThe 27th Infantry Battalion reached at the first lines at 00 : 45 on 24 December. When the Turkish Corps moved to the West, the position on the east side was taken.

{"prompt":"As a child , Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents ' separation . She witnessed her mother 's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized , and even long after","text":"As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents'separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her recovery from mental illness Douglas and her mother remained close friends. She wrote in her autobiography In the Footsteps of My Mother that even her mother's death did not break the bond between them. In a recent interview, her mother spoke highly of her daughter Margaret, saying of her :'Her mother and I got along very well. My mother always respected my way of thinking.' [ 34 ]\nHowever, when Douglas reached adulthood she became frustrated with her mother's lack of participation in her career. Although Douglas had no major conflicts with her father and siblings, she felt alienated from them, and the family was not supportive of her career as an actor.\nFor her first film in 1961, Douglas had to work hard to fit in with the actors of other studios. When she worked with other actors of her new studio she felt an inferiority complex and later she would frequently express,'I don't belong here.'[ 34 ] She would often refer to her lack of success as :'the failure to connect in Hollywood '. [ 34 ]\nIn her autobiography, In the Footsteps of My Mother, she described the events of her first filming experience and spoke about her unfulfilled career ambitions as well as the family's lack of support for her career. She said that her early experience of acting led to her forming a negative attitude towards the acting professions, and she spoke of her desire to break free of'the old Hollywood stereotype '. [ 34 ] In her autobiography, she also spoke with passion about how her father had made her mother feel inadequate about her career and did not value Margaret's career decisions. [ 34 ]\nHowever, she later wrote that although her father encouraged her mother to speak up for Margaret in the family, this ultimately led to their breakup. In In the Footsteps of My Mother Margaret wrote :'Even as a child...my mother was unable to articulate herself or take part in family events... I was never given the right to be heard or to have an opinion in any decision-making.' [ 34 ]\nDouglas became disillusioned with acting and she could see only a few possibilities for her. After moving to New York she took up a job in a real estate company but she wrote that she found her new career 'not very satisfying and depressing' [ 34 ] and in 1966 she quit in disappointment.\nIn her autobiography she said that she did not think she could become a successful author, though she had great ambitions as an actor. She was only successful in her book The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. [ 37 ]\nIn a new interview with the BBC in 1983 she reflected on her career and her family as well, saying,'I could be very proud. I enjoyed it, and I made a mark. But after it was all over and I had done it, it didn't feel like it was my life. It was not my story. I did a lot of things, and I got into trouble in many of them. All I learned from them was to try to be good and to not make a mess.'

The eggs are laid in early Autumn when the tree is fully formed. They are covered by a fluffy layer of soft dirt which keeps them moist and prevents them from being crushed by passing birds or mammals. When large numbers of the eggs are laid, they may form an enormous nest up to 30 feet from the ground and one of these was reported to weigh 6,000 pounds. The eggs are very hard and very brittle, and require careful packing in order to keep them intact and to prevent damage during shipment. Most of the nests are found in the interior, although some are placed on the outer surface or the top branches of the tree. They are easily knocked off their perches, are not large and are generally inconspicuous. The eggs vary in color from reddish brown to brown. The shells are smooth and slightly raised on the outer face.\nFertile eggs develop in less than a week and hatch to give the little baby birds which are about the size of canaries. The young birds will remain with the brood and nurse them until they are able to fledge themselves. These young animals have a lifelong dependence on their parents and are so accustomed to them that in the time of natural disasters such as a fire, flood, tornado, or other calamity, they will come to the rescue and often bring them back to the nest with them. They can be found in almost any tree, but prefer those with branches that have a more open growth pattern. They stay in the same tree until they are two years of age.\nThe first spring, the mother will build the nest for her young. There may be two or three of them in the nest. There are generally three nests or rows of nests placed on the same branch. They usually consist of several layers of leaves, branches, and bark. At the outside edge of the nest there are sometimes found little holes which serve for breathing. A young black bear may often find his way into the nest and bring the young animals into his den for warmth. It is usually the mother who kills the young animals, but if they take the place of their mother, they will take care of them. When the mother dies, all the young animals will follow her to the nearest lake, pond or stream where there is plenty of food for them.\nIt has been suggested that the common black bear destroys the nest if it has too many baby birds. It is very important to know if you have a nest in the woods, because of the danger of bears. It is also recommended that you destroy the nest if you can or, at least, bury it deep and securely so that bears and mice cannot get at the young birds. I saw one such nest with three baby squirrel birds that was covered with fine grass, but was still easy to pull out.","token_len":659,"entropy":[8.9389,1.9675,2.9128,8.7506,2.3683,7.039,0.5256,9.5212,2.0158,0.0013,1.478,6.0955,0.0761,0.0,0.4813,6.7966,5.4572,0.0257,0.5857,8.4891,4.4442,0.8525,0.4543,4.0339,8.789,4.5245,0.3879,5.2707,15.2705,7.8054,7.977,11.5304,8.8102,3.13,0.7454,6.7556,7.8409,8.362,0.4723,0.3235,7.4867,7.2738,0.6598,0.0239,0.358,4.9777,1.1104,0.0176,0.2707,14.0295,2.4353,7.5946,1.1725,4.7873,3.9382,4.3791,2.7911,0.7396,2.2155,0.2695,2.2877,1.5296,7.6047,2.7244,2.0059,0.3799,2.2898,4.2334,0.692,1.7419,1.0143,1.6858,0.1939,2.2244,5.5658,5.4207,1.3427,4.749,8.3771,1.2579,4.0749,4.0976,4.9759,1.8336,0.6669,7.0477,3.5821,2.3671,4.0236,4.6895,4.1292,0.7556,4.988,0.8743,2.0586,1.2412,1.0506,3.5963,1.186,5.5241,6.2222,3.0738,0.8992,2.7238,0.5136,4.0621,4.3576,0.8358,2.2381,1.2056,5.511,2.0882,1.3731,6.793,2.8579,0.0501,4.2702,7.1191,2.9538,3.9809,0.8531,2.0851,1.075,4.53,0.7067,0.0643,2.862,5.512,1.4601,6.8741,2.6881,2.1006,4.5219,0.1712,3.9473,6.2113,2.3625,0.2392,2.0491,0.2825,0.7317,0.6496,0.7722,0.9755,4.052,4.2984,3.4851,5.9778,2.7436,6.1371,0.1648,3.3248,0.4242,3.8942,0.2545,0.9087,2.3418,6.0626,2.475,2.2132,7.1503,7.9555,0.667,6.0227,4.5257,1.6819,0.4512,0.3751,0.5269,1.3882,1.4938,0.9612,3.7859,1.8133,1.2453,3.3382,4.4164,1.795,1.8181,3.6809,4.2466,6.8375,3.6827,0.5688,0.0443,2.229,0.6611,3.6009,2.8959,2.2991,1.401,2.7437,3.8548,7.0538,0.3438,5.0303,1.1767,0.2036,3.9032,0.8909,2.8979,0.7211,1.4762,6.0597,2.9027,4.3177,0.9351,1.1796,5.0708,2.0661,0.9892,5.3884,3.1564,4.7649,4.7488,2.9676,5.2547,0.5554,1.2246,1.1057,0.419,3.1353,0.742,4.9345,5.9827,1.9891,3.4711,4.9432,3.0423,2.4398,5.5951,2.8706,4.6519,2.244,1.501,3.8254,5.8198,0.0032,0.0166,0.4622,1.6675,1.1708,6.5905,0.2869,1.757,0.9087,4.2492,0.013,1.1304,0.2421,2.8466,2.6202,1.606,5.9684,0.6517,4.7022,0.68,5.6482,6.934,4.278,0.6287,4.4161,5.3531,1.3663,4.5834,4.8015,3.0391,3.622,1.5822,6.314,1.5886,6.0925,0.0426,1.6971,1.0141,1.4959,2.9858,4.409,6.5027,1.5645,5.3658,5.6148,5.5687,8.1963,0.7765,3.2977,2.8828,0.2073,0.0191,8.9141,2.0002,1.5394,1.395,3.4474,3.18,3.0065,5.6187,3.8344,0.8088,6.7087,3.0167,6.5618,2.5744,1.4364,0.6176,0.6258,3.6773,0.0017,12.345,0.046,6.3877,1.0918,4.09,3.0326,8.0798,3.0073,1.3811,8.2304,8.4735,0.1627,1.7924,1.5857,1.6372,2.0616,5.5657,5.1834,0.0263,5.4597,0.2841,5.0108,1.577,5.1558,1.8269,6.2275,1.9736,3.7263,0.0472,3.2418,3.2885,1.0703,3.9143,0.6758,3.3085,0.8165,1.5892,2.6124,3.0876,0.0261,0.9279,0.8232,1.852,5.2532,0.759,2.5498,1.3555,2.0372,4.7828,5.5069,2.4395,2.3584,0.9096,1.0633,0.1964,3.0229,1.6015,0.4002,2.696,3.1325,1.4303,2.4806,1.0928,4.1954,1.1913,2.3636,2.006,2.097,7.2577,5.1672,2.2764,4.2388,1.3993,2.2268,2.6044,3.5941,3.1059,6.4266,2.606,0.6027,2.4619,7.229,1.1868,0.561,3.0623,3.7855,3.3032,1.0121,0.6912,5.0595,1.6731,3.0638,0.004,1.0989,1.9228,2.4613,3.9129,5.1504,3.2575,1.3177,4.8955,2.7547,6.9744,2.3605,0.5542,3.7625,1.3219,1.5386,1.0158,4.8845,4.1849,0.1161,2.8539,0.9484,0.5221,2.9049,2.0611,1.3685,0.4964,0.7268,1.7467,4.1434,0.9531,5.8814,1.9806,4.2521,4.7158,4.546,0.7161,2.447,5.4845,1.8022,0.6162,2.9535,2.3106,1.0728,3.2397,3.3881,4.1287,0.0227,4.2302,3.738,0.2766,3.9816,1.6328,3.4919,0.2522,1.3267,4.4274,0.6887,4.6968,1.1161,7.9426,2.4982,0.1018,0.3424,0.9388,2.9654,1.0134,5.2488,8.05,4.8621,4.1556,3.3853,4.8314,4.1241,7.2413,1.263,3.7855,4.3408,6.5237,3.5873,2.3065,6.0015,3.8002,3.1604,0.8461,1.3701,0.5986,0.412,1.9658,5.2113,1.9011,2.2202,5.0221,2.2668,2.5883,6.0266,3.8966,4.4347,0.5108,3.7237,0.5929,2.856,2.7395,2.0341,1.3224,6.9659,0.2948,1.0362,1.3991,2.2104,1.643,3.4664,3.0008,5.9295,2.0387,3.5926,0.0755,2.0346,1.3928,0.9191,1.5809,1.7752,4.3425,1.6465,0.6358,1.0033,0.9355,3.442,0.6758,1.9886,2.7162,0.6672,4.7334,0.8347,0.8469,0.7478,1.8733,5.2424,1.0016,1.9985,0.7623,3.6566,6.8908,2.2402,6.1806,1.3722,3.6711,3.1484,3.978,0.848,3.3938,0.0524,1.5734,1.7217,0.3654,0.3313,1.7446,4.7373,3.8841,0.1701,2.1468,0.1726,0.9846,6.4114,4.3685,0.521,10.3922,0.9265,1.4303,3.7634,1.165,2.6682,4.3771,0.7502,6.929,1.1166,1.3447,2.4896,0.7065,3.6978,3.7426,0.8501,4.0114,3.6989,2.7976,1.1685,1.4468,3.2061,2.2836,1.6171,3.0811,2.1628,2.812,4.677,0.4766,2.4048,0.7843,6.6229,2.5378,2.7811,0.3208,2.3891,3.5863,0.4032,0.4408,5.519,0.766,0.5685,0.9166,0.9269,3.4703,5.5214,5.046,3.544,1.4047,0.205,8.2212,0.9265,5.2146,3.7796,6.0423,3.4654,0.2916,5.0314,3.2531,6.4818,2.4266,2.6065,5.5689,2.0766,4.6053,1.293,0.2326,5.9104,6.8285,2.0294,4.748,0.9402,3.8055,3.3643,3.135,5.4261,8.013,3.3769,3.4854,5.2104,0.9465,6.5587,4.0811,2.5883,2.5959,2.9711,3.9176,7.2067,0.2828,5.6163,1.2703,0.9874]}
{"prompt":"Until 1838 Keswick had no Anglican church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of Crosthwaite . The present parish church , St John 's , was designed by Anthony Salvin","text":"Until 1838 Keswick had no Anglican church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of Crosthwaite. The present parish church, St John's, was designed by Anthony Salvin, who also designed the church in nearby Chipping Hill, which opened in 1843.\nAround 1830 the Chipping Hill estate comprised a considerable number of farms, and in 1833 the first chapel was built at Chipping Hill Highfield. In 1836 the parish was extended and the chapel moved to the new estate, Chipping Hill Farm.\nIn 1859 Keswick was abolished as a parish and Chipping Hill Church became part of a new Chipping Hill and Crosthwaite village, with a parochial school and a chapel.\nSome years after the chapel on Chipping Hill Highfield had been opened, a church building was added to the village. It was designed by Matthew Boulton and the architect was Robert Mills, and opened in 1890.\nIt may be assumed that the new village of Chipping Hill and Crosthwaite, with its churches and schools, would attract a large number of people, but it was to be an unusually small community. By 1905 Chipping Hill was a hamlet within the village of Chipping Hill and Crosthwaite. From that year until its closure in 1966, it had a small shop in the High Street, a chapel of ease in the Highfield Church of England Church and a number of homes, mostly family units.\nIn May 1966 Chipping Hill Hall was moved to a new location on the estate, where it is now used as a centre for the Keswick District Council. Other premises were sold, and by the following summer the town council had decided that there was little else left of the village. It was decided that Chipping Hill Hall would be transformed into an award-winning country house hotel, with a restaurant, conference and banqueting facilities, and a residential building.\nThe plans were approved and the estate was acquired. The architect for the project, Richard Wilson, designed the residential building, incorporating a dining room with panoramic views and an adjacent bar, which was open to the public, along with a restaurant and a pool.\nIn the evening, the main building contained three large marquees, in one of which was the restaurant, and there was a dance room as well as separate smoking and drinking areas.\nIn the restaurant the table-service system was retained, although its capacity was increased by moving the bar up to the main part of the restaurant, where it could be seen from a wider audience. A new bar was also installed in the main hall with bars at the further end of the main hall.\nThe development attracted considerable public interest and was widely considered as being a landmark. The development continued until 1973, when the scheme was halted due to severe financial problems. The final work was not completed until 1977, when Chipping Hill Hall reopened as an award-winning country house hotel.\nThe hotel closed again in 1997. The building remains empty except for occasional events, but the restaurant is still open on certain days to groups of visitors. There is now an informal museum in the hall to show various memorabilia from the earlier and earlier years.","token_len":659,"entropy":[7.7498,4.9817,14.1228,1.859,3.49,4.8523,12.2329,0.1663,2.1798,7.5774,1.9174,3.9405,4.5077,1.8948,1.8987,7.373,0.0276,0.9641,10.1457,5.7845,1.8885,7.9443,6.2937,0.7474,0.0319,1.2252,2.435,7.2282,2.2165,2.8871,2.2386,4.9539,3.148,0.593,1.5447,1.2105,6.374,0.5875,7.5368,7.0867,5.8507,1.5291,1.624,3.2711,1.8616,0.5897,2.3774,1.8713,6.6563,5.2585,5.3353,5.0753,2.1959,2.5849,5.0204,0.3375,0.4666,3.3291,0.2005,1.3006,13.8552,3.95,1.918,5.3324,0.1969,0.0835,6.9748,8.079,1.8826,6.2111,1.8596,0.0046,6.6432,1.1481,2.5406,2.606,0.7659,3.7495,1.4059,3.5217,5.5117,0.644,0.4625,1.8815,2.8805,0.1217,0.0449,6.4974,7.5584,0.9699,2.3063,0.4885,2.6018,1.111,3.2142,1.9578,4.188,3.7203,1.7596,2.9719,5.0722,0.4209,1.7441,3.4723,4.1182,2.0564,4.2807,0.1431,0.1044,4.6463,1.2939,1.2174,1.6408,0.5692,4.838,5.6999,0.0007,1.7823,9.3198,1.3043,0.5048,1.6478,1.899,5.9518,0.0861,0.0159,2.9197,2.6555,3.0798,0.0019,2.9424,2.3307,7.0586,0.1759,0.073,5.7261,4.1087,0.4617,0.0032,0.002,4.8808,2.1613,4.3011,1.9247,7.7257,0.8084,0.0004,1.971,1.8714,1.5137,3.1614,1.11,1.2801,6.1685,2.7842,1.9092,1.2255,5.0413,6.6222,0.8721,0.0554,0.003,1.4109,0.004,4.2735,0.2511,3.5421,0.9496,2.2889,2.9017,4.0032,0.4721,4.2988,1.2845,0.3056,4.0449,1.3155,2.8118,0.5985,4.3377,0.1337,6.3798,4.7146,3.9001,0.5004,1.5677,2.6232,7.3988,1.5614,3.7445,7.9093,1.6817,2.9884,5.2335,0.427,4.6462,0.4441,0.8187,4.279,5.7874,0.618,3.5759,0.1442,1.0597,3.7212,3.8699,2.874,0.1965,0.0674,0.002,4.1649,0.8683,0.0666,0.0005,0.002,3.0934,3.2145,0.6019,5.0105,0.9153,3.2965,0.3481,1.8542,6.1458,1.8162,1.1421,0.5207,0.0034,2.7358,2.3973,2.1139,1.8209,2.5545,5.2953,0.5044,3.6164,5.724,2.9237,2.326,1.012,4.9539,5.7966,3.7144,0.071,0.004,1.963,2.5203,8.1122,0.0037,5.2966,0.7456,2.8768,2.2851,1.302,0.1942,0.0339,2.2046,1.3115,0.0372,0.0009,0.0029,1.2554,5.9442,3.2919,4.3575,1.7344,2.6566,2.1577,0.7722,5.6438,1.3153,2.4476,1.428,1.7329,3.6072,8.1898,3.4008,0.9615,8.5384,2.2132,2.7042,2.8794,4.0183,5.0503,10.395,1.4314,0.5596,3.3677,6.1221,4.7534,3.3766,4.5789,5.4011,1.8036,0.8768,4.5429,0.0012,4.3431,2.5092,4.2199,5.844,5.5238,0.7052,0.6357,2.2647,4.1534,2.9918,2.9761,0.0762,0.0037,7.5386,0.9428,4.1147,0.3317,2.2589,1.1173,2.7336,2.6226,1.1652,5.6047,1.3206,3.3245,0.6324,1.9729,0.5256,4.7273,0.7725,0.4062,5.2993,0.6051,2.6614,12.666,0.0007,8.487,2.7396,1.2099,7.1775,7.2135,2.6056,5.0609,2.5824,1.368,4.48,1.9746,4.4776,4.1645,1.0978,3.2386,3.3945,1.218,3.7598,1.7435,3.5381,0.7999,3.7105,4.764,1.78,1.9832,1.5733,3.668,1.2449,3.2239,0.979,2.9168,0.8872,3.4186,0.07,0.0034,1.2714,1.3081,0.7378,4.4041,0.1708,2.4256,7.0517,0.6088,0.0082,7.5116,1.7719,6.7121,0.9751,1.8631,1.1089,4.318,0.8904,6.2309,3.5878,8.6574,0.033,0.3749,4.8189,1.0687,1.4718,1.0404,5.7149,4.5008,1.2835,0.6762,1.8074,7.2235,1.6973,2.9221,2.5756,1.0646,4.7011,0.7103,4.9673,3.2879,1.4711,7.1663,5.0355,0.3254,3.7577,0.5577,4.1815,5.9931,0.3039,3.7023,0.5856,6.1542,1.1486,1.4524,6.23,1.4013,5.0725,0.7719,2.4325,6.6249,0.2385,0.0028,0.2086,2.2851,2.4889,4.4056,4.324,1.8344,2.8672,1.483,5.2364,0.8242,0.2514,0.0247,2.615,5.6945,0.0724,0.7274,3.8277,1.1361,1.4976,6.3085,0.776,1.1095,2.3749,2.4994,6.692,2.3328,1.3544,4.6777,2.2181,8.5861,4.3884,2.9382,9.313,0.4405,0.9683,4.8855,4.6512,1.2564,0.1975,1.1415,1.7308,5.7357,1.2227,1.5319,5.027,0.6908,0.6763,5.9346,2.7182,4.8528,0.1543,0.613,6.1355,8.1751,2.8408,1.2357,0.6877,0.5462,1.3573,2.1659,1.1788,7.5679,2.5737,6.1471,2.9425,4.0922,5.7864,0.5497,5.5906,0.6712,3.4125,4.3916,5.598,0.5088,1.7672,1.6829,5.7042,0.9694,3.1902,4.3555,0.971,0.8786,3.8343,5.7724,0.1601,0.0206,1.4939,1.2625,2.2771,1.4231,2.6185,0.4942,3.5274,0.831,2.7544,5.4436,4.705,0.2881,3.5314,3.3963,2.734,0.9544,2.1333,2.7239,2.0922,0.178,1.6932,3.8434,4.0972,7.1038,4.1059,0.6542,7.9783,0.4283,0.9848,0.1023,2.7307,0.8636,1.0993,0.7298,1.1347,5.8837,7.36,3.1055,3.0209,1.4586,1.5334,2.5676,4.5662,2.6177,2.657,3.8731,1.3789,4.595,2.159,1.7415,3.7443,5.2085,1.4483,4.7732,1.0112,0.1005,1.0731,8.2147,0.2796,5.746,2.8786,0.0034,6.2943,2.815,1.4879,0.596,1.8877,5.4172,5.9035,1.5038,5.9308,0.506,0.092,3.1454,0.6707,0.6099,5.4576,0.054,0.0045,1.9575,4.7891,1.7584,2.2788,0.2174,0.0623,0.0017,1.3104,0.1146,0.2391,0.829,0.5705,1.5906,4.6045,5.8178,4.5431,0.2311,4.2447,1.9082,1.7471,2.7749,3.9416,4.9428,4.4229,0.1218,5.8901,3.9516,1.3672,2.8215,1.4315,3.8791,2.0768,1.1293,1.1275,4.3293,6.5007,0.9532,5.0272,7.7997,0.2591,2.8663,0.7585,4.0667,0.94,4.3698,2.1882,5.4268,6.2476,2.4699,0.3013,4.6663,4.0495,3.7703,5.9466,7.7237,0.0014,1.3462,0.3802,6.9017,5.3478,3.4165,1.6663,0.7036]}

Prior to his appointment, he described his role in Afghanistan as one of leadership, not combat duty.","token_len":660,"entropy":[7.6567,3.9901,3.746,0.57,11.4067,1.9935,0.1807,0.3314,1.3676,2.0487,0.8228,2.2117,0.2663,10.8266,0.1913,0.3109,0.0336,0.5261,6.6279,0.0349,0.0219,2.0703,4.3794,0.77,10.3527,0.018,7.0091,2.3325,4.273,5.0769,2.4682,0.1443,1.8369,6.1667,1.676,7.0459,2.6125,1.0326,0.1151,5.432,0.0013,1.9265,0.8373,2.044,4.1207,5.727,1.2009,0.9477,0.0635,3.2095,2.774,1.8325,17.7442,0.0149,3.8571,2.7272,0.1238,1.566,1.717,3.087,1.828,3.7668,0.0001,1.845,2.703,0.0562,5.2484,3.4455,2.1631,0.0242,1.0969,2.689,1.6773,7.0811,0.0179,1.0234,5.1421,5.3261,2.1338,6.6996,1.3688,1.9487,5.2542,5.2578,6.21,2.8977,2.7265,0.4218,1.4672,1.1643,1.2034,1.1863,7.6755,0.126,1.0494,6.2446,2.105,3.7315,0.0932,6.347,2.0286,5.1409,2.9999,2.3646,0.0686,1.5332,1.9005,2.9276,0.3372,1.0016,3.3081,1.1592,3.3052,7.3486,0.0999,1.0069,7.0083,8.0269,1.8486,1.2503,0.5912,0.0166,3.6122,0.7816,3.2561,0.164,0.0049,0.0043,1.2976,3.3035,0.5056,4.4532,2.1811,1.1963,1.9481,3.1613,1.1626,0.3865,3.3397,0.9028,4.5049,6.0745,3.7144,8.7121,0.341,4.4928,2.454,2.1898,0.6056,2.4828,5.8415,0.1379,3.2947,3.1455,3.4647,0.0037,0.4082,2.3726,2.8734,0.9317,3.971,0.1313,0.0227,0.2422,3.0464,1.7899,0.5476,0.9975,2.7482,0.0042,0.0276,0.0061,0.5141,5.3539,1.9264,2.7968,0.1891,0.3662,1.0839,4.788,0.2707,5.3462,2.6799,0.2867,0.6671,4.884,1.1004,5.103,0.06,1.2964,7.1599,0.2656,0.0025,7.9357,1.4396,1.1427,2.8404,3.1951,0.0876,3.1702,3.2423,0.0287,1.3958,1.9684,3.1373,1.4279,3.561,1.8346,0.9028,0.2567,2.1379,0.0314,0.2025,0.1416,3.8758,0.7795,6.3521,0.0913,0.0187,0.3899,0.5255,5.2037,2.5763,3.7024,0.0513,4.7843,0.3836,0.1615,0.0255,1.1221,4.4661,2.1555,9.1755,2.1213,0.689,3.6213,0.0284,5.5645,0.4203,0.566,8.2064,0.0053,0.2231,3.3302,0.0682,1.7067,0.5352,1.0423,5.5502,0.0519,1.4162,2.7951,0.0057,2.0595,2.7801,2.2556,0.0101,0.8555,0.1064,1.3471,4.2687,2.4988,1.3659,5.85,0.2731,0.6334,0.0036,2.9907,0.1095,0.3017,4.4355,2.6319,6.0471,0.507,1.8706,1.3884,1.2626,0.008,5.1812,0.1672,2.7367,2.4362,0.0158,2.0741,1.6724,3.4103,0.0053,0.0017,2.903,4.3312,0.3338,7.0588,1.5403,2.7899,2.6271,3.066,1.4484,0.0004,0.6914,3.9341,1.9867,0.7716,1.7355,0.0042,5.1029,0.773,0.8116,2.3745,6.7121,1.4102,1.6336,2.527,2.3682,1.8335,3.7629,3.0485,4.9932,0.3041,1.641,3.6397,0.0106,2.0162,1.0152,0.614,0.0028,0.1536,0.0692,1.3403,4.2194,2.3531,0.5252,0.8471,0.8541,3.6361,3.4188,2.065,0.2418,0.0706,0.0062,1.2618,4.3085,0.1927,0.8739,2.5335,0.0193,1.4746,0.1255,2.7259,6.5423,1.0204,3.2128,0.2704,0.4281,1.7345,4.0897,2.8134,0.5573,1.9725,0.598,0.0959,0.0626,1.081,2.766,6.5963,1.1275,2.3223,3.3958,6.9017,0.0004,0.5175,7.3645,2.1095,0.0014,0.0027,0.5193,2.2673,2.2035,0.159,0.6642,0.1351,0.179,0.0109,1.6786,2.4972,2.4681,0.1187,0.2955,4.5002,0.0373,4.4102,4.0855,1.5056,0.8005,1.7318,5.7796,0.8479,0.3834,1.4484,0.2096,0.0089,1.9798,2.9397,0.1631,1.463,0.0008,0.1044,1.8708,3.0659,3.4707,0.0178,1.5857,2.0795,6.7443,0.5339,3.8389,0.0098,8.2027,0.0576,0.1714,1.4312,3.6721,2.4386,3.6603,0.0165,1.6182,0.189,2.2454,6.5102,0.1761,2.243,2.0041,2.972,0.5225,2.9519,0.1324,3.6185,0.0036,1.0247,0.2689,0.2244,0.0318,0.0171,0.0223,3.201,5.0303,4.4053,2.1382,3.975,0.3242,3.017,0.9586,2.9001,3.8071,0.0057,1.2637,6.0739,1.6964,3.1218,0.0037,4.4923,6.8653,5.806,1.9181,2.9524,1.3901,0.0473,0.12,1.1887,8.8072,11.4185,1.3722,0.6678,0.1835,0.0286,9.8089,0.8192,5.2456,2.4056,4.3459,4.296,6.2519,3.9235,5.7002,2.2298,2.0753,6.6216,5.2051,4.7656,1.07,3.8069,4.4822,1.2088,1.7735,0.246,2.8028,2.8429,3.1854,0.0289,4.6526,0.1401,0.318,0.0088,0.6804,6.8022,1.5165,5.8905,3.2729,0.9599,4.8225,1.1621,6.8799,0.7777,1.7429,0.1171,5.2424,0.1451,0.7082,8.0343,0.6504,3.0072,2.449,4.9795,5.4424,1.025,5.0374,4.7745,11.1654,0.5297,0.2146,0.007,3.5239,0.2061,1.524,5.288,4.3829,6.7687,2.6936,3.5035,2.5228,6.1025,1.2581,0.0377,1.4908,7.7523,5.2435,0.5513,0.0067,0.8997,1.47,5.1356,8.1661,1.8706,2.2578,11.2175,1.8432,2.7591,3.6956,0.7555,3.2127,1.7142,0.3904,3.5566,4.058,5.9472,5.2195,0.5297,1.17,1.4023,3.5183,1.4212,3.8108,3.0332,2.3954,4.5329,6.2161,1.2398,0.4297,1.7182,0.0069,2.6713,2.4585,0.6363,1.8823,2.0356,0.0766,3.2383,2.1426,1.0929,3.6877,1.0512,1.8413,3.0944,1.3921,3.9502,2.358,1.0085,4.2472,4.9754,0.9625,2.2711,0.0039,1.8096,3.0975,2.807,1.7464,6.4022,14.3148,3.2959,3.5992,3.1863,1.2133,1.2466,0.1009,3.2588,2.892,0.4696,3.3247,2.0006,5.5414,0.9322,5.4047,0.8056,2.2195,0.6916,4.2538,0.4937,0.9959,11.3017,0.006,4.8993,4.1257,0.6832,0.5645,0.3953,1.503,6.5691,2.5981,0.2735,0.676,5.6852,0.0005,1.0408,5.7798,2.4137,1.3533,7.6636,1.1072,3.7811,1.2822,3.0046,0.1945,3.8186,0.2818,4.4064,1.1397,4.8939,3.4678,6.0556,0.2392]}
{"prompt":"Three independent ( private ) schools , including Episcopal High School ( 9 @ - @ 12 ) , The Post Oak School ( Montessori K @ - @ 8 ) , and the Veritas","text":"Three independent ( private ) schools, including Episcopal High School ( 9 @ - @ 12 ), The Post Oak School ( Montessori K @ - @ 8 ), and the Veritas Christian School ( grades K - 8 ) to name only a few.\nWe have a close relationship with the surrounding communities, with an active Parent Teacher Organization and with the School District of West Covina.\nWe are a small school but with an extensive sports program, including a successful football program that went 7 - 7 this past season despite losing only 2 players.\nWe host a wide selection of student activities and extracurricular activities.\nThrough our generous participation within the St. Edward School District, we have been able to implement our own vision and philosophy of educating and promoting spiritual and academic excellence.\nFor this reason, we were awarded an Exemplary School for the year 2007 - 2008.\nOur goal is to provide the best possible education with a rich faith based curriculum.\nSt. Edward is an inclusive school, however, we want to make sure all students are given the opportunity to excel.So we place great emphasis on individualizing the curriculum to ensure that each child has access to an appropriate level of challenge.\nThis year, St. Edward received an award for its Positive Behavioral Intervention and Support ( P.B.I.S. ) program.The P.B.I.S. program aims to improve the school's functioning by reducing discipline problems.\nSt. Edward is proud to be a member of our region who is home to the highly regarded Covina Independent School District - a first class system that strives to provide quality education for students, teachers, and parents.\nIn the Fall 2004 the school had 180 students ( boys and girls ) enrolled.\nThe curriculum includes a Bible study at the start of the school year and a special class offered in the afternoons for 8th grade students.\nDuring the academic year, the school has the option of two types of class schedules.\nTraditional academic class schedule runs Monday to Thursday for grades K - 8 and an Extended Day program runs Monday to Friday for grades K - 5.\nThe school is organized into six sections :Grade K \u0096 Kindergartners Grade 1 \u0096 First Grade ( K @ - @ 2 ) Grade 2 \u0096 Second Grade ( K @ - @ 3 ) Grade 3 \u0096 Third Grade ( K @ - @ 4 ) Grade 4 \u0096 Fourth Grade ( K @ - @ 5 ) Grade 5 \u0096 Fifth Grade ( K @ - @ 6 ) \u0096 Grade 6 \u0096 Sixth Grade ( K @ - @ 7 ) \u0096 Grade 7 \u0096 Seventh Grade ( K @ - @ 8 ) and 8th Grade \u0096 Eighth Grade ( 9 @ - @ 12 ).\nSchools throughout the country are being threatened with closure, and St. Edward is very fortunate to have a staff that is committed and dedicated to making sure our school is here to stay.\nOur goal is simple, to offer the best comprehensive education available for

{"prompt":"From the book 's publication until the early months of 2003 , its sales were unsatisfactory , according to Bill Goldstein of The New York Times . In the week following April 7 , 2003","text":"From the book's publication until the early months of 2003, its sales were unsatisfactory, according to Bill Goldstein of The New York Times. In the week following April 7, 2003, for example, Amazon.com said about it only that: \" 'Exhalation is the key to a happy life,' was the title on an old wall hanging... This is a clever play on a familiar theme. If we read it aloud in unison, we can escape the anxiety that can arise from an uncertain future and focus on today.\"\nThe New York Times, also in its April 7, 2003 article, wrote of the book that it was: \" a quirky, humorous exploration of the challenges men face, the choices they have to make and the joys they experience,\" and that it was: \"not for the faint of heart, however. It is a cleverly worded play on manhood... As the title suggests, the book has a somewhat depressing cast of characters... The play seems to take a lightness of touch on its subject that seems to imply that any man who does not read it for hours and hours out of boredom or ennui may be lacking in the qualities required for masculine excellence... To be sure, Goldstein is not an expert on men or gender studies,\" but: \"his work is funny, smart and well researched.\"\nThere was also some dispute, as The New York Times reported, that Goldstein was responsible for a column published in a Philadelphia newspaper, and named The Philadelphia Inquirer, a week prior to the book's release, that began thus: \"Today's men no longer go places, make ends meet and give their loved ones the pampering they so long desired. All three must be done in a single day in ways that are both easy and fast enough that they will have never had to learn to do it that way in the first place. \"\nThe controversy, as The New York Times reported, stemmed from the comment and the fact that it was published as the first essay in a column series of the newspaper in which the columnist \"exploded.\" The column writer complained that Goldstein had plagiarized the quote from an essay written by a male colleague at George Washington University in which he said of the \" men on the outside looking in, who are so busy pursuing the myths of masculinity and so quick to criticize... they are never able to see the heroism beneath our masks.\" The New York Times article stated that the New York Times had contacted the author of the essay and his employer to inquire about the matter but that the Inquirer declined all further comment.\nThe New York Times article concluded that Goldstein might have \" used the quote in some context with some sense of irony but, in a column that he himself called 'Homicide By Status Attraction,'\" quoted the author of the essay as saying that Goldstein had: \" chosen it out of context, and then cited the entire line as if he were going to argue it in the column's direction.\"\nThe following week, however, The New York Times reported : \"For the most part, Mr. Goldstein said, he did not think the controversy mattered to anybody outside Newark... He said he expected it to make him famous but also to help him do a better job of the book.\" ","token_len":662,"entropy":[2.4913,5.7655,2.7144,5.92,9.3749,2.1064,3.7761,7.5791,0.0608,4.3321,0.1533,5.7677,4.5851,1.3078,11.6032,0.1502,1.501,3.6337,0.0009,7.1683,8.3541,3.0671,3.2047,1.8505,0.1764,0.044,0.5212,3.0191,2.2732,6.7638,2.2432,7.5314,3.7144,0.1278,1.9249,0.0399,6.3899,0.785,0.0034,5.5001,2.7109,0.0343,5.0334,5.6838,5.4518,6.8896,1.8578,4.8728,0.567,8.379,7.0467,11.4484,0.4476,2.0964,2.5366,3.9579,0.4375,3.0167,4.5899,3.1576,3.1455,7.4637,1.0147,2.3246,3.717,4.2492,6.1157,7.8461,7.0034,10.3736,5.1743,1.7841,1.7151,6.7559,6.7085,0.2104,3.4739,3.912,2.5907,1.9759,4.259,3.0417,4.8809,1.9133,3.6172,3.2491,8.1265,0.5951,1.2333,1.9469,8.0865,1.2082,5.5957,2.169,4.4196,3.6229,1.0694,4.3881,4.9094,1.6203,2.3903,4.3791,0.2689,7.2718,2.6357,0.8746,10.8165,4.4975,0.0862,0.0244,3.1727,6.5233,2.3229,2.6901,3.1312,0.9191,0.9003,0.0603,3.7478,0.2257,3.2943,2.9824,1.059,1.7844,4.2314,2.1367,2.2173,4.8653,0.3109,5.7693,7.3462,1.6663,3.9377,5.754,0.1687,1.133,5.76,6.003,0.2781,2.9932,2.3885,6.2445,0.4462,3.1822,0.4886,0.0272,1.5227,0.4375,4.9608,1.2024,0.9466,2.4898,5.4743,1.2933,1.252,1.4326,1.2904,3.374,0.1231,4.42,3.0724,0.6842,0.1914,0.2974,0.0007,1.0733,5.0941,2.5789,1.7266,0.9726,1.2004,5.7823,3.0509,4.5623,0.0009,3.5277,0.1135,9.513,2.1326,4.0237,4.9202,2.282,1.9102,0.6504,0.0705,1.6911,0.4577,3.5004,1.7632,6.319,6.0815,6.4387,0.7129,0.1382,3.3324,2.1694,5.361,5.1056,0.669,3.9614,2.0216,6.1289,2.589,3.0218,5.0691,4.5636,3.4879,1.9211,3.5326,4.075,0.8154,4.2301,1.2097,5.5334,1.9287,1.1845,3.6166,0.2784,4.8854,1.2671,4.5456,6.6302,2.9436,0.7765,7.611,0.1872,2.1094,2.8804,8.7447,0.3214,0.0013,2.5886,1.8084,7.002,0.5194,1.5596,3.9211,3.2769,1.2384,7.0216,4.5488,3.1318,5.0285,2.4298,1.749,0.0414,7.7908,2.7486,2.2634,3.91,0.9946,0.8843,3.0467,3.3768,5.2839,3.7618,4.586,1.5546,5.6139,0.1489,4.6294,2.7254,1.2936,6.6817,1.0379,5.1471,1.1199,3.4576,2.4786,1.5165,0.4607,4.6527,1.8262,2.3914,3.4396,5.507,4.0668,2.8982,4.2682,0.4288,0.0484,0.0104,2.6525,1.0697,2.549,4.1274,1.868,5.992,0.0289,3.6992,6.3967,3.6853,0.8457,3.6823,6.5434,1.4584,2.2551,2.9607,10.3303,5.1285,6.5201,1.3569,0.0027,0.0004,1.8178,2.4145,7.6496,4.5653,0.3619,0.6905,0.8591,0.4477,2.6948,1.1286,4.8593,6.2047,8.4086,0.34,0.3825,5.7304,1.6762,4.3309,7.2716,0.193,5.8101,6.4505,3.4076,5.9414,6.0055,0.0031,1.0598,6.1155,2.0784,6.6343,0.0324,1.7298,7.6826,2.9645,0.1498,1.1298,2.5934,3.9654,4.2183,1.3391,5.8238,6.66,5.6895,1.9401,5.3336,2.5301,1.8243,4.3195,1.991,4.3788,7.8095,0.3467,2.3398,3.3377,4.2773,0.55,6.0087,5.3856,4.6491,1.3098,2.2655,3.6189,5.426,3.1067,1.298,5.3821,1.2646,2.4398,1.9549,6.4951,0.1405,3.2972,1.2544,0.2413,0.0006,1.766,4.1182,2.8881,1.9177,6.1973,2.5872,2.7189,2.4848,0.8109,0.0119,0.0121,1.4051,0.2657,3.8295,0.1553,1.5241,8.1151,5.7609,2.422,3.0821,0.0676,2.5632,1.0141,2.3364,3.7645,3.7172,2.4694,5.9525,0.9076,0.7421,3.6048,7.7788,4.4079,1.4597,4.9785,3.5454,1.124,1.8757,5.2543,6.3858,4.0477,4.8091,2.9609,1.5878,2.1484,7.8329,5.318,0.6432,1.6751,1.6836,6.0736,0.021,1.9025,6.2896,1.0396,3.8307,1.7629,3.1897,0.3034,2.3636,4.1022,3.8133,2.7542,6.9294,0.6778,0.0137,2.1848,2.821,0.5658,2.0008,3.5749,1.5585,3.7628,11.1063,4.7848,0.9574,5.4154,2.6144,0.0505,2.3914,3.6745,1.6674,3.3556,4.9364,5.7866,2.8345,9.3913,0.5799,1.6406,1.8071,6.5694,6.5315,0.2808,4.8562,7.4885,2.5086,1.9211,5.0053,3.1167,0.0098,3.2179,1.3636,10.0876,6.8265,4.9944,6.9323,1.1002,1.8216,2.7766,0.0297,0.0195,4.4292,4.3557,0.6493,1.4602,5.1253,0.207,0.7464,1.8394,5.6906,1.3966,2.1374,1.6155,0.2717,1.9833,1.6297,5.245,4.326,3.1277,2.2992,0.3288,0.9563,2.0818,3.3912,1.5132,1.5838,6.6213,0.0022,0.0058,3.7597,6.9202,2.1235,1.3392,0.35,0.5722,1.4884,1.7688,0.0152,0.019,2.5756,4.356,1.5877,2.2453,5.9286,0.4332,3.0654,9.0652,1.4068,2.3497,2.4091,4.548,6.7556,4.8752,3.1415,4.3624,0.0962,2.1027,5.2123,3.7637,2.0354,2.8968,8.1129,1.7761,3.9803,4.5141,4.5066,0.726,10.0156,3.3105,6.5351,11.9002,8.5309,1.5114,2.3141,9.0633,2.7318,2.8002,1.4721,0.3288,0.9179,0.7739,0.1724,3.9444,3.1869,1.5182,4.6975,0.358,9.8036,5.1134,3.3256,0.0672,3.2985,2.1763,2.2957,3.793,6.6,2.0702,5.3324,4.4299,2.3818,3.2544,2.6325,1.2125,4.1159,0.2,5.3031,2.5524,3.1277,2.4532,4.6761,4.94,6.3602,1.4426,0.9858,1.5136,5.4842,1.9167,0.292,4.0112,0.0016,1.2932,0.585,0.0056,0.0056,2.688,8.5496,0.4938,5.2045,1.708,3.7216,0.0102,0.2137,3.6171,0.0032,0.1374,4.2724,1.2198,1.038,2.5818,0.1897,3.0189,1.636,6.9954,7.2109,2.5987,6.5686,6.3814,11.9295,4.3846,1.7147,1.5834,0.8601,5.4532,2.8467,0.3864,4.7754,2.1334,5.7716,3.3787,4.7028,2.2077,3.8116,1.4115,5.439,3.0455,0.9722,0.0192,0.7749,4.8916,2.0432,1.2988,6.867]}
{"prompt":"Supervision of the construction was lax , which enabled the contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels . This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed","text":"Supervision of the construction was lax, which enabled the contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels. This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed, killing at least fifteen people.\nThe original section of the new road was opened to traffic in June 1857.\nThe original section of the new road has since seen a number of accidents ; two pedestrians died near Mt. Taranaki Railway tunnel in September 1996, and a woman crashed into the centre pillar of the St John's Railway viaduct in February 1999. \nOn 29 October 2010 one of the four passenger coaches driving a coach bus travelling southwards along the old route of the Old Auckland Railway crashed into Mt. Eden Viaduct.  Two of the passengers survived and the bus driver suffered leg injuries; the other two passengers were flung out of the bus and critically injured. The bus driver was transported to Auckland's Waitakere Hospital where he was treated for a leg fracture and chest injuries, and was later flown to Christchurch. The bus was also extensively damaged. A motorist travelling south on the viaduct at that time claimed that the emergency driver should have slowed the bus down but instead made a U-turn and cut across the viaduct, and later that there was traffic congestion on the viaduct despite the bus approaching from the right. The driver's lawyer subsequently admitted that they could not believe the speed of the bus travelling at about 50\u00a0km\/h on the viaduct and that a passenger could also have been injured had the coach braked or reversed as soon as it came to the right hand bend in the viaduct.\n\nNew route\n\nIn 2004, the construction of a new route of the Old Auckland Railway began, and the Old Auckland Railway viaduct was demolished. The new route is the West Coast Line, which passes adjacent to the Mount Eden Viaduct.\nThe West Coast Line is a short line of railway and is currently used for commuting in Auckland and for freight traffic. The line consists of an elevated viaduct and tracks that begin adjacent to the Mount Eden Viaduct in Wellington, but travels inland past Pukekohe.\nThe route was inaugurated to commuters on the inaugural train from Palmerston North to New Plymouth in May 2007. It later joined the New Plymouth line of the North Shore Line in September 2007, and the Central line in March 2008. It is built to serve the tourist and commuter industries as well as the agricultural belt between Waikakao and Whakatane, and is part of the New Zealand Government's vision to build more than twenty high quality stations along the line over the next ten years. This will be done by building out from the existing suburban stations at Ponsonby, Lake Wakatipu and Waitemata, to meet or surpass the national and international standards for New Zealand stations.\nWhile the West Coast Line was undergoing construction, the Auckland Council decided to close the Mount Eden Viaduct to improve accessibility to public transport along the route. The original section of the viaduct along the west side of Lake Wakatipu was closed in November 2006, and the east side viaduct and pedestrian path was closed in May 2007.","token_len":664,"entropy":[9.282,2.9241,1.8582,8.4979,5.6407,9.9572,1.5978,4.5099,5.8261,1.3139,5.3292,0.1227,8.5223,0.2885,0.1279,1.7725,10.2394,1.6703,0.6062,5.0317,1.0648,3.8147,10.9848,0.4783,0.5585,7.902,4.6939,4.3703,0.8463,7.509,0.0238,0.455,7.8975,1.4029,2.4909,7.8428,10.5892,3.8962,3.9111,1.8401,2.6039,3.9272,0.0026,5.7065,0.9644,0.5771,1.4737,6.5247,5.2078,6.9792,0.2122,0.3919,5.1221,4.9558,1.1871,3.8344,1.8546,0.8869,1.4931,3.3948,0.3543,2.5864,1.2296,2.7545,1.4358,3.4583,2.2833,0.0966,0.2058,1.1887,0.1107,3.965,2.8178,5.7831,2.1166,1.8013,0.0009,4.8886,10.8854,4.6979,4.6663,2.4344,5.6459,6.2548,0.4907,8.2859,2.3789,0.2077,6.3385,5.9782,0.79,3.5672,7.726,1.3184,0.8823,1.3986,3.4127,7.4471,1.0656,1.4435,6.0516,5.7089,0.3204,0.7922,5.5746,5.0671,0.7456,4.6899,5.2328,0.0011,0.0,0.4661,2.6981,2.5823,0.2284,7.7737,4.8286,3.9532,5.012,2.7329,4.2503,5.6384,1.0977,0.2277,4.0668,5.713,5.5629,7.1112,1.6327,5.1379,4.3241,4.2805,3.5591,5.2684,3.545,0.5338,3.6832,3.4755,1.624,0.5276,4.603,7.8619,1.4583,7.5395,1.2393,5.2515,0.3929,7.8533,7.2739,0.0011,0.0001,1.5736,2.2232,6.7742,2.0915,0.1112,1.6311,3.634,1.9202,2.3228,3.7816,2.5923,4.7382,6.4645,0.3608,5.9044,1.4836,1.0468,0.9025,3.3678,0.6984,9.1238,2.384,0.3691,0.0826,0.9475,1.4777,6.3579,0.1455,0.26,2.5461,2.619,0.8541,0.9444,3.8228,0.0998,3.583,4.0902,9.5391,1.491,0.0032,0.6105,2.04,0.4568,1.0277,2.2727,0.4266,2.8625,5.4141,2.1756,1.4916,6.8041,2.7771,3.2422,1.1962,2.1544,2.0991,3.4921,0.4607,2.5434,0.0026,1.512,2.6214,2.4186,1.6975,3.7088,7.6245,0.7337,2.2188,3.9327,6.2015,0.6654,3.3651,2.469,2.0157,0.7891,5.5709,0.0017,0.0019,3.4618,4.8893,0.0449,5.5119,1.4663,1.3405,7.319,4.7493,6.877,0.1562,6.1367,1.1792,0.8066,1.5344,4.4591,1.7484,5.1463,1.1429,5.3432,0.0177,0.0006,1.675,6.5001,5.42,0.2722,1.2645,0.0081,0.0054,2.6433,3.8743,5.9415,3.5967,8.873,0.3731,6.0638,3.408,1.9473,0.3662,1.8945,0.0117,0.0018,8.9605,0.8428,4.5595,6.4868,3.36,0.9233,2.3626,0.5037,1.9217,1.868,3.1426,5.198,5.2593,4.3134,0.8807,5.4662,3.8361,0.8425,4.9222,0.891,5.1391,0.6314,0.071,0.4933,5.6106,1.088,5.9288,3.3432,12.9584,1.71,0.1453,0.0476,4.3286,0.694,1.8157,0.0067,0.0036,2.5018,1.6439,4.0856,3.8592,2.9028,7.0029,0.4798,1.4324,1.8332,6.7847,1.0929,4.5814,10.6771,0.049,3.7907,6.1993,4.5561,6.4486,0.0047,0.9488,3.3117,0.8019,2.761,0.7516,6.3584,7.4968,4.0826,0.4062,2.1949,0.0081,0.0032,0.239,1.5119,8.2409,5.4749,8.0231,3.0904,0.9265,2.9029,5.4483,0.9717,1.1427,5.3543,0.3167,2.4457,0.4979,1.8724,2.4167,0.3591,1.1832,0.1472,0.1275,3.905,1.9858,2.1398,1.7269,6.1747,0.2501,0.2968,4.8651,0.0059,0.0008,1.0122,6.5437,1.1977,1.491,1.9834,0.9273,2.0748,3.3741,6.8787,3.5884,3.3129,1.4821,1.3103,5.5559,8.9075,0.3491,0.8783,6.251,4.2264,0.2594,0.0009,0.0007,1.485,1.4456,5.4114,2.8981,0.0167,0.2538,1.553,1.5022,4.0996,4.5028,1.1575,3.1069,4.344,4.5022,4.4651,3.349,1.5876,5.523,3.4373,2.2065,1.9997,4.6476,4.299,2.9597,0.6371,1.5941,4.3595,3.994,0.0515,3.7031,2.2891,2.2695,0.0015,0.046,2.324,5.3794,3.0854,6.4162,8.8732,0.0317,0.4095,3.8279,0.0085,0.2245,0.0019,0.0023,3.7615,3.9075,1.908,5.3745,7.9597,5.3339,6.1243,6.526,5.4879,3.0289,3.2466,2.822,1.3858,1.731,3.5694,2.7134,5.1765,0.0001,5.4245,6.5312,1.6405,3.1652,7.903,4.4808,1.9524,7.5936,0.0864,0.8045,1.4894,3.6649,2.1291,1.6845,2.8586,2.7807,0.4348,2.5902,6.2626,5.5941,0.2944,2.3424,4.1757,2.3454,4.2371,1.8761,5.2375,1.4991,1.0965,1.8198,3.0708,2.079,1.7305,1.0439,2.3607,4.9822,3.876,1.0856,2.9799,0.9634,0.1867,2.9629,1.5733,6.1846,2.8353,3.2127,1.3553,6.1335,2.0026,3.7646,4.1701,4.1495,0.5971,0.0106,1.2989,6.2628,8.7906,4.8586,4.8561,0.0637,9.8375,6.0009,0.2735,5.8756,4.0244,0.7275,2.4059,2.0754,0.977,1.391,3.3058,0.0023,0.4169,2.5427,0.4641,4.668,0.19,7.1154,1.0211,2.6216,3.2899,1.1708,6.7629,4.7103,3.681,5.2651,2.9551,0.3748,5.0266,5.6693,0.2433,0.1082,1.7073,0.0547,0.1002,4.8211,3.4502,2.219,3.0234,1.0341,3.5145,4.9577,6.1025,0.8141,1.531,7.3669,2.6455,2.799,3.7313,5.9549,0.0124,1.5151,6.713,6.6723,2.5604,2.3638,3.6126,1.2288,6.5593,4.6716,0.0286,1.628,2.4325,5.7657,5.9544,4.0535,0.5643,5.786,3.8417,0.7072,2.9741,2.2609,5.8678,0.0115,5.6171,0.6322,0.7692,6.502,0.7752,1.4135,0.004,0.1508,2.2558,6.8511,1.3419,0.7763,1.0681,3.7533,7.0294,3.315,0.321,4.5462,0.7634,5.0651,0.0067,0.1295,0.0009,0.0024,2.2426,8.5897,4.3188,2.0221,4.309,0.129,5.2475,0.476,1.5966,0.3654,1.3609,5.0643,3.699,0.2049,0.0986,2.5458,0.0038,0.0028,6.577,0.4118,3.301,0.8298,0.2076,6.9323,0.1528,0.0043,0.0014,0.0043,0.7585,1.5168,1.3491,3.6124,2.3779,1.1846,0.882,0.9843,4.9882,0.4108,8.8283,0.0056,0.0031,3.9363,5.762,4.5899,1.7528,1.4721,0.6014,3.0248,1.0692,0.3207]}
{"prompt":"Because of the xenon atom 's large , flexible outer electron shell , the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions , and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical","text":"Because of the xenon atom's large, flexible outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions, and can therefore be used as a probe to measure the chemical bonding in a mixture of compounds. For example, in aqueous solution, the NMR signal for hydrogen is strongly suppressed due to the proximity of the hydrogen protons to other hydrogen nuclei in water molecules. Similarly, the xenon nucleus is located some distance from hydrogen, its NMR signal in solution will therefore be somewhat broadened in comparison to solid xenon.\nIn recent years, researchers have studied the effect of environment on xenon NMR, and more recently, the xenon NMR technique has been used to differentiate between compounds with similar chemical structures and similar properties. For example, a group of compounds known as phenylinic acid analogues ( PhA ) consist of a central benzene group with an attached phenyl ring. PhA is important because compounds with this structure are commonly used as pesticides. Because of the similarity of the structures of these compounds ( fig.3 ), they can be difficult to distinguish in a solid sample, or in a product of a chemical reaction involving multiple compounds. The xenon NMR technique can be used to differentiate between compounds with similar structures and different properties, such as different functional groups. For example, several compounds, including acetylene and 1,3-diphenyloxybenzene, share a benzene nucleus, although these compounds are very different in color. In this case, the technique can separate these species based on the size of the xenon NMR spectrum ( fig.4 ), as well as the strength of the xenon NMR signal.\nAlthough xenon NMR is only beginning to be applied to environmental problems, it has been widely used in the petroleum industry for many years. For example, researchers have used this technique as a diagnostic tool for understanding reservoir processes. One important consideration for using xenon NMR as a diagnostic tool is that it must be calibrated against other traditional analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and chromatography. Since these techniques are often used to measure the concentration of particular compounds in a sample, they can be used to provide a direct comparison to xenon NMR. Figure 5 shows a chemical species comparison table for a number of different compounds. These compounds were selected to represent a variety of structural types, including straight chains, rings, and carbonyl, ester and amine groups. The comparison can be used to define the xenon NMR spectra for the various compounds, and can also help to determine the types of compounds that most effectively block xenon NMR signal by adsorbing to the xenon surfaces. This information can be useful in understanding the mechanism of action of xenon NMR with respect to sorption processes.\nIV. Conclusion\nAs more complex analytical techniques are developed, researchers will use multiple techniques in order to increase their ability to understand the samples under study. As the scope of the research increases, researchers will also seek techniques to more accurately determine the concentration of analytes in a sample, rather than attempting to measure absolute absorption at a single wavelength. The use of multiple analytical techniques offers a powerful means of characterizing the environment.","token_len":664,"entropy":[2.828,1.2492,11.3138,6.961,8.2347,2.0536,4.9783,4.1879,5.6339,3.74,6.762,2.5599,0.3209,1.6474,7.0255,2.8968,4.6212,6.298,3.0935,3.2323,0.0093,7.9031,2.9928,1.9516,1.8267,4.6817,3.0709,0.6879,1.5106,1.7667,0.4199,5.5781,1.9488,2.2017,0.9005,4.0584,5.6555,4.7025,2.6773,5.6837,0.1291,5.2766,0.8071,3.8758,0.627,0.0151,3.0013,1.6027,4.7578,0.0004,2.341,0.9353,1.282,1.5525,0.0009,4.3626,4.9433,4.0936,2.1293,4.8933,5.2315,4.2528,0.0019,0.8459,7.0041,0.1639,0.6896,1.9042,9.7,0.0922,0.5436,4.6488,2.3491,4.2261,0.0171,2.9744,6.4174,2.9697,0.7051,4.6326,0.0355,2.0474,7.237,0.0025,3.6905,1.6541,6.1536,8.0207,1.5369,0.8173,4.0393,1.8204,7.3899,3.6978,0.006,0.7438,4.4999,4.8786,5.649,4.6085,0.5355,5.2274,8.8549,1.8337,2.8391,4.682,0.3845,7.7497,5.0464,0.0946,0.9862,1.5827,11.9614,5.6174,0.2851,0.1879,3.3902,0.1214,4.7048,0.4855,4.4177,0.0427,8.1065,0.5849,4.3074,0.0462,5.961,0.0033,3.4738,1.5047,6.1949,1.0251,0.8319,2.2836,4.6238,0.0121,2.0523,0.0033,8.5188,0.3876,0.5428,1.4894,0.4144,7.821,1.6844,4.6213,1.6481,4.2586,2.2606,2.0807,1.6222,4.9433,4.4026,0.5319,2.7028,0.177,0.0042,2.6325,3.9933,0.1921,6.07,2.7818,0.1194,6.3675,1.4111,12.777,1.2458,5.0319,0.5519,1.2304,10.1956,3.494,2.5577,8.3265,0.0704,2.0029,6.9975,4.4406,0.1889,2.5452,2.2567,2.4359,6.6781,3.0559,0.1031,3.7762,1.6773,2.9318,0.0286,1.2208,5.9262,1.9123,7.5397,0.6098,3.8763,1.5176,1.5333,4.1465,0.8859,1.4882,8.0602,2.2751,4.5501,0.974,1.2037,4.4571,0.6836,1.0883,4.7083,1.1148,1.6997,0.4256,4.5438,11.967,0.1569,7.9511,0.5281,3.055,1.5562,0.3631,7.1932,0.0498,1.325,3.1974,2.6244,5.6049,3.3695,1.8639,4.3529,1.4259,0.8408,7.6123,1.6826,1.7552,2.3141,1.2812,4.441,4.1482,2.29,0.6608,2.7421,5.4148,0.0048,0.4667,0.0006,1.4107,2.2042,1.1949,0.5072,0.3558,2.9888,0.6351,1.592,0.6546,0.5383,3.5548,0.6568,2.1118,0.351,1.3512,3.0551,0.023,5.7519,7.0258,1.2583,1.4524,2.2373,0.1024,0.0066,5.5317,1.497,2.9532,1.9138,5.6764,2.5758,1.6305,6.5525,0.4411,1.575,0.2178,0.6145,2.2469,0.0591,0.0532,5.5899,2.3516,0.1325,0.1526,0.659,5.7483,1.2368,4.241,0.0466,5.0875,1.897,4.3565,2.7228,0.533,1.204,4.5725,1.4879,1.3253,6.9619,1.4107,2.3807,2.2512,3.0066,0.0412,0.98,8.1916,1.2113,7.725,2.697,6.8383,4.6275,0.038,1.0923,5.1726,0.6264,0.201,3.0941,0.0035,2.7417,0.0007,1.6915,2.4951,1.2356,0.0172,1.4696,2.7547,2.7607,0.6175,0.0021,0.7711,5.2953,0.115,0.3059,3.2362,0.0019,1.0497,0.001,0.4431,0.8211,0.8989,4.786,2.7001,0.008,0.3385,0.0006,0.9825,4.7376,9.3182,0.0158,0.2658,3.5854,0.3884,7.0344,4.4704,0.3347,1.1701,1.5066,1.4526,3.4464,0.5268,1.4609,1.627,8.5647,0.7521,1.9209,2.0923,0.1799,0.6642,2.8937,0.1672,0.0046,6.8287,0.4498,0.9941,3.2235,0.5238,4.8114,0.3965,4.0338,0.4648,1.0966,5.3331,10.8057,4.4822,1.8463,4.5364,3.2329,4.7516,2.3001,4.2297,0.8594,0.0026,0.0632,0.0003,2.5822,0.1463,0.6062,0.207,0.3258,0.8492,0.9784,4.6536,0.4086,4.2231,2.6338,4.0252,7.6695,3.3098,1.3425,1.1168,0.3913,0.0011,5.969,1.17,0.0751,0.0046,1.906,5.6877,1.8371,0.0325,0.0011,0.1975,0.5611,4.3047,0.8049,0.5687,5.2072,3.9363,1.1954,0.9293,3.2734,1.1368,1.0144,2.0239,1.0614,4.4883,0.1655,5.7796,1.2125,1.5192,1.1746,1.5086,0.1894,1.331,1.5946,0.6393,0.9744,0.5607,4.8668,1.3753,5.0901,1.7709,3.3619,5.4105,0.0038,0.2371,0.0005,1.0582,8.2023,2.5406,0.8481,1.4955,5.4341,6.0739,3.768,3.3664,1.9527,2.5941,3.4768,0.0007,2.6056,2.509,1.3519,3.3152,2.205,2.6527,2.3652,2.3316,2.3929,2.2999,2.8301,0.0012,6.2811,4.9436,1.0495,1.815,9.9056,7.7728,0.5875,4.8924,0.1472,1.1327,5.5617,2.4343,0.3203,5.9591,6.9289,1.4571,3.407,4.2375,1.6213,2.5033,0.7636,1.574,4.5555,5.2632,0.416,2.0707,0.2722,5.1952,1.1836,8.0491,0.0017,0.1855,0.0007,3.4918,0.1376,2.1804,2.3571,2.6203,2.1299,1.4055,1.2763,2.6499,1.1863,2.8946,0.9722,2.4264,0.6966,6.1511,0.1196,1.9105,1.0542,5.7833,4.8044,7.0211,2.8565,0.003,0.2331,0.0013,3.7133,5.196,7.761,0.0233,1.007,3.8916,1.1645,2.4378,0.008,7.5645,0.5071,3.6786,2.7636,0.69,0.7356,2.8922,1.0427,3.0111,0.7724,5.0186,0.9237,2.8979,0.2353,1.4482,0.0027,0.3078,0.0007,5.5213,1.1845,0.001,10.4099,1.3851,3.7505,1.0258,0.8241,10.5696,0.1294,4.8511,0.329,6.0589,4.5656,4.8837,5.8391,0.7395,0.6041,0.6697,0.55,5.8816,1.6334,4.6272,6.926,3.0122,2.8565,0.7554,0.0013,5.9878,1.3324,1.9651,0.0051,3.342,0.7676,9.3016,5.6646,1.1626,0.2788,3.406,2.1067,6.0919,0.1575,1.0984,2.7152,0.86,0.1034,3.8191,0.3792,1.7965,3.4048,6.0229,1.3266,5.3934,1.0238,3.6295,0.3656,4.2611,0.3038,10.2906,0.2602,1.5637,1.4067,0.5244,1.3248,5.5372,0.0067,5.8582,0.0691,2.2142,7.7885,5.8762,4.4076,2.0981,2.5845,5.4367,0.4633,2.4882,3.2421,0.0279,2.8838,0.9205,0.2961,6.9726,1.7026,3.8624,2.6959,0.8631,7.2598,0.0068,0.8984,4.91,3.2338]}

He and his staff were responsible for many important research achievements, including the discovery that chloroform is a volatile, colorless gas. The first products included a yellow gas called bromide; it was found to be very powerful and could not only kill insects but was also toxic to frogs. These discoveries led to the creation of the chemical company of DuMont Laboratories, which is now part of Honeywell. Later, DuMont Laboratories developed the Dynamite, one of the most significant weapons of the Second World War.\nToday, Honeywell and DuPont jointly form an untapped area of development of organic chemistry. The chemical industry was not only large but also dominated by two big chemical companies that were vertically integrated. Their products included not only pesticides, but also textile dyes, paints, plastics, etc. Chemical companies used large areas of land, which required intensive water use.\nIn this case, agriculture was in competition with chemical companies, who were able to buy the cheapest land for their use. One of the main competitors in the industry, DuPont, introduced innovative organic molecules that could not be achieved by chemical companies due to large technology investment costs.\nBy the 1920s, the market demand increased, due to the large consumption of chemical products, but production did not meet demand. The first solution was to import chemicals from abroad, and the second solution was to grow their own materials.\nThis process required a significant investment in land, seeds, fertilizers, and technological development. At first, the companies considered it unprofitable because they were not interested in spending millions of dollars, which would return the profit only after a long period of time. But in the middle of the 20th century, the situation changed significantly. Today, the chemical industry is a large market leader with annual revenues that exceed one trillion dollars.\nMost of the industry is dominated (in terms of sales) by Dow, a chemical and polymer company. In many respects, the company is the leader of the chemical industry. There are only three chemical companies that are at the top of the world ranking: Dow, DuPont, and ExxonMobil.\nThe main sources of revenue and profits for the chemical industry are from the following categories:\nChemicals and materials for processing raw materials: fertilizers, industrial chemicals, packaging materials, paints and coatings.\nThe key chemical products used the industry are: ammonia compounds, vinyl monomers, esters, detergents (chemicals used for cleaning), plastics, dyes, food products, fertilizers, plastic bottles, construction materials.\nThe largest production volume of plastics was realized in the 1980s, when the rate of production was more than 150%. This was due to the development of large-scale production techniques and the increasing demand for plastic packaging. Today, plastics produce from 5% to 7% of world trade in industrial products. This is not surprising, as almost all consumer products are designed with plastics. Among the most commonly used chemicals are: polyethylene (PE), terephthalic anhydride (TPA), phenylene diamines, olefin, polypropylene (PP).","token_len":665,"entropy":[10.7007,12.8714,4.7223,1.9816,0.3616,4.8567,1.3152,2.8156,0.099,7.2836,3.8847,0.5149,6.2053,0.0557,5.4113,6.0496,3.1723,8.5806,12.5192,6.832,8.101,9.0449,2.9493,3.113,2.602,7.3945,2.3747,4.3055,2.3364,0.9456,2.4625,4.2842,0.3156,4.2672,2.5042,3.1304,0.0262,3.4647,3.1543,2.733,5.7502,1.4202,0.6362,0.8752,1.846,3.325,5.6639,1.5593,0.0153,1.7524,1.6873,7.6944,2.9482,6.5117,0.0572,3.4552,1.6534,2.3822,3.7212,6.7244,7.0729,2.8599,6.0304,4.7767,2.596,4.7356,1.0009,1.9263,4.2242,3.9139,0.6074,3.7968,1.8899,0.7864,3.6261,5.0033,1.4582,2.9899,4.8695,2.1862,2.0309,2.9806,1.044,3.9469,0.6058,4.1335,0.5007,5.556,0.9562,4.8264,3.4433,1.9095,0.3885,0.763,2.1861,0.0265,0.912,3.5987,6.2518,4.8092,1.7114,0.12,0.9302,1.4123,1.2739,2.6879,0.9132,3.6627,0.004,6.7875,0.1684,1.4905,5.6636,1.1291,1.7775,0.0015,0.6469,3.0022,1.677,12.1818,0.2898,2.7116,5.1881,0.0228,0.1426,0.9296,5.0758,5.6354,1.5303,3.4879,2.8609,0.0103,0.0012,0.4628,1.9415,9.9928,0.3709,4.4371,0.0006,3.8701,0.6937,6.4293,5.6423,5.2071,3.5093,7.4946,0.2469,5.6075,0.3066,5.0375,2.6537,6.2602,2.0476,1.3474,2.0635,4.5819,2.0645,4.5388,3.4611,2.2711,6.377,1.3545,0.8774,4.0798,0.1604,4.8417,4.1252,3.6493,0.5012,3.3448,1.7537,7.7373,0.0493,1.0955,4.7359,3.7026,3.3506,7.2741,0.0909,3.6499,1.3492,0.5712,0.263,9.1195,6.7183,0.0036,0.4828,4.267,0.2162,3.1739,0.2296,4.576,0.2816,5.5182,0.597,4.7347,5.0942,5.9773,0.1132,2.7728,2.2552,3.4745,5.1374,4.7866,5.2365,1.983,1.4332,3.1434,2.7494,4.4044,5.1536,0.1527,6.8464,1.1062,4.7041,3.9061,0.0838,1.9769,0.3501,2.3557,2.6634,1.3478,3.8669,0.0072,4.661,2.347,6.6306,1.4829,3.053,1.0959,4.1633,0.4208,4.8862,0.5761,0.3185,2.5086,2.6714,2.9011,0.9603,3.1669,2.098,2.1546,0.0035,0.4976,6.2965,6.7583,4.1452,6.3536,1.9797,1.8796,3.9552,0.951,5.6788,1.2972,3.6054,1.0624,4.1038,0.0109,5.2068,7.1035,5.6728,6.901,0.2712,1.9342,4.7213,1.1483,3.6965,0.3948,0.1588,1.7991,5.1969,5.4886,5.7168,2.7192,4.8029,0.3621,0.8734,4.3938,7.3183,0.2163,3.9298,0.7674,2.2545,2.7442,6.0569,4.6482,0.0232,4.6517,2.3366,0.9123,1.9522,3.6054,7.0508,1.1978,1.4905,5.4707,3.1587,0.6125,2.8017,1.0813,2.1172,2.1568,2.212,1.8595,0.2329,0.3392,5.1699,3.9274,1.7853,6.3464,0.8511,1.9104,3.962,2.308,5.0174,1.9765,3.1135,1.6376,1.5561,2.0308,1.0328,8.4566,0.2866,3.2548,0.0709,0.2523,1.3582,9.084,2.7531,0.5203,4.7332,2.9121,0.2305,1.5112,4.1574,5.3353,2.8052,5.8611,1.6509,0.0002,3.4678,1.4193,1.6964,1.554,5.133,0.0179,7.9406,3.8902,0.769,0.0309,4.1229,3.2853,1.9266,7.7537,1.9255,3.9958,6.3549,2.6137,2.1428,2.9241,0.6173,0.1071,2.0594,0.2202,2.7412,2.428,0.9154,6.4431,0.0765,0.2669,1.5444,0.0533,0.0834,0.1047,1.4517,4.8146,0.7952,4.9563,0.6734,4.5254,0.1408,1.6583,3.745,0.6558,0.8481,2.9355,3.4387,4.1609,5.3742,2.661,6.3923,0.635,4.6054,1.8463,6.1044,2.535,0.112,0.3584,0.8261,5.8651,0.8068,0.408,4.6257,2.3547,3.6673,9.9825,2.9976,2.5201,0.0029,3.8147,0.8542,0.0141,4.2597,2.8449,5.1657,2.409,4.4263,7.5759,0.9041,1.12,3.0348,5.4976,2.8461,0.116,1.4734,3.5489,0.9968,1.9292,4.4772,1.8845,0.3889,2.1875,0.2195,0.8909,4.9789,0.3837,4.0091,2.4295,2.6548,0.2166,1.8746,1.2436,5.5192,0.3874,0.8234,0.1794,0.2698,3.6878,3.2841,1.6797,2.1831,2.1052,2.5688,0.0006,0.5629,0.0915,5.9395,0.478,0.1004,1.0477,2.2245,4.5578,6.2277,0.1071,2.9684,4.9434,0.8084,1.0187,1.1211,0.4075,0.7539,0.3224,2.2851,1.4635,5.8567,3.6588,0.1781,0.7137,3.489,0.9618,3.3293,4.7121,4.066,5.8773,8.6394,0.3817,3.0232,6.9458,0.027,0.2486,6.52,1.3544,0.2235,6.5055,1.9179,0.2302,5.5614,2.5465,5.9135,0.0003,2.3268,0.5972,3.6701,5.6223,4.0144,2.6809,2.2488,8.0173,6.8512,3.3961,2.1789,6.1361,7.7814,0.3916,6.405,7.7063,2.3161,0.1562,7.5193,0.122,0.2332,6.2227,0.0595,0.002,4.9251,5.9152,0.0878,2.0848,1.8315,3.7226,3.34,3.7851,0.3301,5.6408,0.0017,0.3722,5.12,3.487,0.3803,5.1705,0.0222,0.2807,5.1998,3.9722,0.2642,7.6944,1.1402,2.2618,0.5656,1.5796,3.3523,5.2223,4.333,1.6145,4.991,2.654,6.5747,0.4536,0.723,2.8149,0.0896,1.1662,2.2348,1.5996,7.1571,0.2584,1.8303,1.6776,4.0809,0.0223,5.5452,5.0865,2.6399,2.1847,1.8771,0.0932,0.7005,4.0068,0.0814,5.1774,2.5014,0.0694,2.0737,4.294,2.517,1.3707,3.8802,2.5391,0.2682,3.4168,3.5516,0.9349,4.4806,0.1408,2.0632,4.217,6.2571,4.6633,2.2452,0.1379,3.256,0.259,0.139,4.978,3.6637,2.6968,6.258,1.4059,0.5165,3.7276,1.3556,3.9848,2.9113,1.7288,1.4663,5.8783,0.8564,5.0529,0.4823,0.9456,4.711,2.1038,2.2928,2.7673,7.4227,0.6156,1.3356,4.6821,0.167,4.3052,0.9405,2.4574,2.8995,1.0756,0.0024,2.9735,2.5966,0.3367,5.6963,2.2734,0.0021,6.0217,8.6071,0.2034,0.1021,0.6508,0.4891,4.9776,0.08,4.6979,3.1327,5.9567,5.1799,1.2707,6.0165,0.1505,1.7194,1.7005,2.4731,2.2969,0.0106,2.7737,1.6599,5.88]}

He also claimed that certain politicians might be undercutting small firms in their attempts to increase their influence in the bureaucratic process.\nIn addition, Bedell had been part of a series of political hearings into the \" oil wars \" that had occurred in places like Alaska. But he never spoke of one of the most controversial of the cases : the murder of oilman Hugh M. Heffner, in the summer of 1937.\nHeffner died in a shooting out in San Francisco. Bedell said he did not want to speculate on his death, but that he thought the oilmen themselves might have had something to do with it.\nThe hearing had turned into a soap opera. The Democrats claimed that the Conservatives and Republican members had been in the act of conspiring to steal the oil rights to the territory of Alaska. The oil industry was under attack from both sides of the political spectrum.\nThe public, too, became quite interested. And before bedell had finished describing Heffes investigation, a reporter had the nerve to call him a traitor to the American interest.\nThe House investigation into oil and the energy industry went through three years. There were more hearings than the Supreme Court could sit through! Bedell's report ended in a bland, almost unconvincing, statement that if we cannot be certain that no oil company is committing oil wars illegally, the oil companies themselves were committing illegal action!\nAnd that is enough to satisfy Bedell.\n\" Some of my statements may have been prejudicial to the oil industry, \" he wrote in his report.\nHe also called for legislation to help ensure that oil companies and their employees would have no choice but to make good on any oil fraud that had been committed. He warned in particular against government involvement in a company that was being sued.\nThe final straw came in the spring of 1939, when Bedell was informed that the oil companies' lawyers had secured a Supreme Court ruling declaring the House hearings illegal.\nIt had been agreed that they would be terminated after Bedell submitted his report to the Congress. But the government lawyers simply refused to drop the case and went to court. Bedell was called to testify to the court.\nHe had no choice. A few weeks later, Bedell found himself in Washington, where a hearing had been scheduled in his presence... on the very subject he had dealt with in the weeks before : oil wars.\nBedell was forced to testify that the House investigation was only an investigation, it was not a judgment on any oil companies. It merely looked for evidence of oil wars. It never intended to take legal action against any company ( nor could it ).\nHis own testimony was used as the basis of much of the legal evidence that came from the court. Bedell died a few weeks later.\nAs a man of his integrity, this was hardly the worst fate he faced in his life. As a Senator, he had made the political decision to fight for the poor. Perhaps that is why people remember him best.\nHenry K. Heffner\nHugh M. Heffner\nHenry K.

This hotly","text":"Sent back on mission to the army in Belgium, Saint @ - @ Just again took supreme oversight of the Army of the North and contributed to the victory at Fleurus. This hotly defended front was the scene of the battle of Fleurus. It was the centre of this battle which ended the Great War The front line of Fleurus was located in the Meuse from Montcornet on the east to W\u00e9pion and Maroilles on the west and the battle there was extremely bloody. Many things that went into the making of the battle of Fleurus can be traced back to Saint @ - @ It was he who ordered that all the front line batteries had to be protected as close as possible to the earthworks so as not to be seen when the heavy artillery opened upon the French positions. Saint @ - @ also had at his disposal a remarkable photographic apparatus with a scope of 50 feet that enabled him to photograph the action on the ground. The front line was so heavily manned by both sides that the firing was continuous. So much the more did Saint @ - @ keep close to his men. They did not want him to be left alone, especially when he received orders to retreat from a position at W\u00e9pion, just one stage ahead of the battle. His men followed him and succeeded in protecting him all the way back to the Belgian army headquarters in Li\u00e8ge. After the decisive battle of Fleurus - @ Saint @ - @ was discharged with the Legion of Honour and as soon as the news of the death of his late brother @ was reached, he went to his former home in Saint @ - @ He received the news of his brother @ by telephone and his heart sank at the news. He knew that his brother @ could speak to no one so he was determined to visit him there and learn the truth about his brother. The trip took several days. He travelled with a companion, a fellow Belgian, who gave him information at the home of a friend. The man had left Saint @ - @ and moved to the East, where he was able to get away from the Nazis. The man would inform Saint @ - @ that his brother had decided to seek shelter in the United States which was one of @ the first countries to declare war against the Nazis. A few days later, in a small town near Li\u00e8ge, he met the family of the man who had been the source of the information about his late brother @ He was told directly by Saint @ - @ who had decided to visit France. Saint @ - @ wanted to go to France and return from there to Belgium, with the intention of informing the family about the death of their late brother @, so they could not follow him as he had feared the Nazis. The two men travelled to Paris, from there in good health to Marseille - @ It took a few more days by sail.

{"prompt":"In 1954 , a licence was issued to Canadair to build the derivative Canadair CL @ - @ 28 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus , and the Canadair CL @ - @ 44","text":"In 1954, a licence was issued to Canadair to build the derivative Canadair CL @ - @ 28 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus, and the Canadair CL @ - @ 44 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus variant.\nIn 1962, a programme was announced to procure 40 Argus Mk IV.4s. The model was equipped with a turbofan Lycoming O-300, and fitted with a cockpit that allowed it to fit onto DC3s. This was seen as a very economical solution, and the aircraft was called the DC3s with Argus engines.\nCanadair received a licence to build two derivatives of the Argus Mk IV.4, the Canadair CL @ - @ 50 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus, and the Canadair CL @ - @ 67 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus, fitted with a slightly larger Lycoming O-350.\nIn 1970 the Canadian Air Force ordered ten CL @ - @ 67 \/ CP @ - @ 107 Argus as the first part of a plan to replace the ageing R9F Super Guppy aircraft. \nDuring the 1990s, the Argus was again used by the Royal Canadian Air Force as the standard piston-engine replacement for its fleet of Boeing B707 Airborne Command and Control aircraft. The Argus's primary role with CFB Montr\u00e9al since 1999 has been CATOBAR (Composite Air-to-surface Takt Training) training. From 2001 to 2003 the B777s with Argus engines were also provided as training aircraft for CFB Trenton's Composite Air-To-Surface Takt training.\nThese aircraft are used to train both command and control personnel, and the air support crew of the fighter, ground attack, transport and multi-role aircraft. Additionally, they are used to train the personnel assigned to the tactical fighter, tactical strike fighter, tactical fighter bomber and tactical strike bomber squadrons, as well as commanders of Air Combat Command and Tactical Combat Command. They can also be used for short-notice rearmouts. For additional information, see the F-3A Canadian Interaircraft Command and Control (CIC) training section below.\nDuring its life, the Argus was the only aircraft ever developed by Canadair. However, Canadair did not manufacture the aircraft themselves; it contracted out the main work to BOC Aviation (a division of Bombardier Inc.) and Westar Industries.\nIn 1986, the Canadian Pacific Air Services also used the Argus variant CP @ - @ 117.\nThe Argus engines were replaced by the R9F series of turbofan engines in 1996, and a new version of the engine, the R9F-1, was added in 1998. These new engines are much larger and provide more thrust than the existing engines.\nDuring the mid-1990s, it was hoped that the Argus series would be able to be retrofitted with a turbofan engine. However, it was decided that it was to high a price for this capability to be economically justifiable.\nAfter the B777s left service with CFB Trenton, all spare parts were sent to CFB Rainsville in Florida for use with B777-300ERs.","token_len":667,"entropy":[10.9163,0.2732,2.9535,12.2317,0.8269,0.9193,0.8139,12.5909,1.501,1.5839,4.1897,2.2114,12.4087,5.255,0.0801,9.4374,11.6008,6.4854,5.6657,7.1403,7.1274,8.9715,5.1373,2.2999,1.3511,7.1305,13.5051,1.9763,3.0228,3.1707,2.1829,4.2132,0.0089,1.0468,0.3428,0.8816,0.0331,5.2431,0.272,0.1316,0.0533,0.2134,0.0361,4.0297,1.6585,0.0019,11.4015,1.9756,1.9361,5.8713,3.2429,0.2369,1.8405,7.5297,0.7242,3.7856,1.0033,6.421,7.5379,8.2061,0.0271,5.8082,3.8623,4.5141,6.7459,2.3562,2.3102,1.7035,6.0352,0.9255,4.7399,0.0467,0.9909,6.3603,0.9107,0.008,11.997,0.6598,6.4895,1.3865,6.897,3.26,2.5022,4.4435,0.1259,0.8818,7.4203,3.968,4.1012,2.5079,0.0549,6.6004,4.176,10.2731,6.0474,4.0523,0.8747,2.8779,1.7185,6.0559,0.2723,0.7587,3.9799,4.8028,3.0584,1.7653,1.2434,1.9328,3.7445,0.6287,5.0731,0.6491,7.6261,0.7808,3.9849,6.2608,8.6673,0.0012,6.3567,0.7116,0.9943,7.8335,0.161,0.0051,5.8526,1.3956,2.2957,1.1324,0.9785,3.4864,7.2387,0.5825,0.5424,5.7497,0.0034,3.3962,0.3846,0.5557,0.7257,2.4146,1.7555,4.6092,0.0485,1.2429,0.135,0.5305,0.0321,4.5943,0.1664,0.1171,0.0346,0.1371,0.0121,2.7206,0.1137,0.0014,0.671,0.5246,0.2012,0.048,0.0022,0.0256,0.0029,0.045,0.0067,5.3324,0.0764,0.0104,0.0092,0.0479,0.0075,0.7636,0.021,0.0011,3.4259,5.2449,0.2157,0.9585,7.0535,1.9021,7.2692,0.0052,0.3433,0.0021,4.1476,1.288,1.0581,1.6722,3.6642,3.1038,2.6595,2.295,0.6327,3.6679,5.943,7.3992,1.4186,0.4641,0.0217,3.953,0.0586,0.0171,0.0124,0.4546,0.0092,0.441,0.0339,0.0012,5.8777,3.1382,2.6548,6.5332,0.088,1.2028,5.8314,0.2205,2.2852,0.3813,5.78,5.6439,6.0489,6.096,5.3807,9.0868,3.8058,3.8204,0.8186,7.8923,5.6369,4.8093,0.6538,4.5122,0.1525,0.5799,1.2258,4.3713,0.0076,2.53,5.3813,1.8592,1.6278,0.8494,2.6319,0.1846,0.1749,0.03,2.104,2.1261,4.2979,6.7974,0.6605,1.7923,4.8546,0.5966,3.8244,7.2554,0.3103,6.3061,3.3075,8.3528,6.9917,2.3872,6.0404,3.3355,1.0648,1.3876,0.4613,2.1001,2.2189,0.001,5.978,4.7114,2.2465,4.7601,6.204,1.9585,11.1841,0.2906,0.0,7.6977,5.1933,0.7833,0.0884,17.402,7.9512,5.1249,2.4915,4.5853,2.7381,0.1522,4.515,3.353,0.4852,0.0086,4.9212,13.315,4.991,12.0789,3.0589,3.1618,1.2757,6.3054,2.5867,0.6457,2.2544,1.8613,5.4424,3.6118,4.2786,4.6288,1.6559,0.0031,1.6887,0.6895,3.3647,4.7552,2.7019,2.5478,1.1982,1.5299,3.0253,0.0926,7.3637,0.3034,2.8642,8.8974,0.4959,0.2175,5.6595,0.001,0.3976,0.0021,4.2597,0.0776,2.7529,1.2728,0.9193,5.6195,1.2738,2.1151,2.7291,1.9951,0.7175,4.4409,5.7593,0.1589,0.7377,2.9082,2.2569,1.3519,3.5504,5.381,4.8574,4.1719,2.997,0.914,6.3318,3.5614,6.0128,3.147,2.0053,5.0863,0.6219,7.0705,0.5492,0.3178,1.5185,0.8746,6.8862,0.3503,2.4804,0.6653,0.5357,1.0194,0.8127,1.9973,5.1009,4.5982,0.1043,1.3954,5.4294,4.9393,2.4175,4.5973,4.8977,3.4169,0.8161,2.7389,4.4568,4.1288,0.8612,1.8826,2.794,1.8242,4.4017,0.0183,2.2444,1.8783,0.0144,0.0024,7.8624,1.4071,5.8401,2.5952,0.6984,1.4776,4.5136,4.3019,1.2291,1.0963,4.0554,3.2323,0.5905,0.5444,0.2715,1.4804,6.3453,0.5236,5.384,8.0063,3.7103,11.2583,2.3106,4.599,5.2309,0.8856,1.4039,0.6865,1.2328,5.3077,0.442,4.5533,2.481,6.1097,8.9881,5.8154,5.8732,3.9979,2.7257,1.8451,2.2524,1.1306,0.7043,3.1389,4.0024,3.9188,3.2488,0.1742,0.298,5.1786,4.4418,3.6322,0.8216,0.3922,0.7195,0.0011,0.9743,2.6893,1.5042,1.8459,5.2924,3.8239,2.3131,1.6586,0.0019,1.5595,3.2812,0.0659,5.279,0.0007,3.5604,1.4521,4.2576,0.8492,2.3891,6.4323,3.5311,1.9812,5.5696,3.8308,1.2137,7.2191,5.9558,1.0965,5.2001,5.9752,4.9053,2.7257,4.4964,3.4848,0.0724,4.7049,0.012,0.0032,4.2252,1.2663,1.6261,7.8879,8.9064,4.5889,1.794,1.3626,2.5608,4.5729,0.3478,1.05,1.4978,7.7771,2.0265,5.0519,6.2497,5.5576,0.3822,0.5036,0.001,5.3253,8.528,0.3175,0.3232,0.0222,5.2397,2.5996,1.6491,1.9908,2.033,0.0008,7.9506,0.7039,2.9375,0.5291,1.1175,3.0033,0.4038,0.1455,5.8187,1.1937,3.5733,0.1065,0.3552,2.0221,3.1249,3.431,1.4659,1.2006,3.4786,1.8677,2.4044,0.8644,0.2279,3.8692,3.5814,1.0855,1.3357,0.1463,0.2142,2.0741,2.7339,0.5989,0.1847,3.4724,0.6765,2.1666,0.193,4.1917,3.0597,1.071,2.2109,4.3582,2.1635,1.1484,4.7639,1.9859,1.4535,2.0598,0.2809,3.6296,2.9604,1.1316,1.4813,3.9829,0.6758,3.9452,0.269,0.6643,0.0202,0.2952,4.3208,0.3348,6.6719,0.1321,0.6549,2.3363,0.001,6.6282,0.4341,1.3386,2.4947,0.0025,3.0984,6.3211,0.0392,0.9906,1.5216,5.1779,0.0186,0.0257,1.8693,1.3041,0.9453,0.0279,2.6214,0.7293,2.8754,0.5564,2.313,1.2144,7.0015,12.6927,7.6844,3.4292,3.6151,2.125,5.2055,2.4648,0.9448,5.5468,8.6473,0.0809,0.8527,1.3471,3.9883,1.0827,5.1221,0.8969,1.3048,6.0566,4.2316,2.2792,2.2826,0.0288,0.3822,0.0007,1.2193,5.7894,6.4357,0.1632,1.2336,3.5909,0.3266,5.7051,0.2297,5.8522,7.6471,0.3688,2.6808,5.7543,1.2256,3.4658,2.3348,5.1753,1.6583,3.3512,4.8099,6.7463,3.1431,0.5441]}

He was promoted to","text":"In March 1939, Robertson was appointed commander of the 7th Military District, which encompassed the Northern Territory. It was his first command since the First World War. He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 October 1939.\nOn 15 November 1944, Robertson commanded the Northern Territory Force and sailed with his force to relieve the Royal Australian Navy expedition force in French Polynesia. On 20 November the 1st Division arrived at Tahiti where they were assigned to the task of protecting New Caledonia and Polynesia from a possible Japanese attack. In April 1945 Robertson was placed in temporary command of the 1st Division as Admiral Sir Harold Alexander assumed the responsibility of the commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces in New Zealand.\nAt the end of World War II he was created lieutenant general on the retired list. He died in London.\nAs a Navy commander, he received eight Distinguished Service Orders, and for New Guinea campaign in world war II he was awarded the Navy Cross, Legion of Honour, and Order of the British Empire and for the Far East campaign in World War II he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and also awarded the Medal.\nWhile in the United States, he was presented with the Croix de Guerre.\nRobertson married a woman he met at the outbreak of the First World War and they had a daughter named Margaret. Both Robertson and his wife had served with her father, the 1st Lord Westland, in his capacity as head of department of aviation at the Admiralty.\nHer father died on 25 October 1940 while he was serving with the Royal Navy's 3rd (New Zealand) Squadron. In his will he bequeathed the name of the New Zealand Army's Royal Naval Air Service Regiment to her.\nWhile serving in New Zealand he inherited a small estate at Strathroy. It is described as being built in the early 1880s and in the main it consisted of three dormer cottages, an entrance porch and a large stone stable bay with a long stone block wall. The main part of it has a stone wall leading down to a small pond which is used for duck and fishing, and also planted with numerous fruit trees and flowers, as well as a pond for watering stock.  The house had no electricity, gas or a drainage system but had a garden which was used for fishing on New Year's Day.\nThe house remained empty for nearly a decade. When his wife Margaret took over the estate, in 1954, they began renovating and restoring the house, which had been listed on the New Zealand Heritage Register for a short period before it was demolished. The house was demolished in 1959 as part of the original extension of the present-day house.\nIn 2008, Robertson's granddaughter, Mary Robertson, was given the house with an estate of about $45,000 from her grandfather.

{"prompt":"In its opening weekend in North America , Ratatouille opened in 3 @ , @ 940 theaters and debuted at number one with $ 47 million , the lowest Pixar opening since A Bug 's","text":"In its opening weekend in North America, Ratatouille opened in 3 @, @ 940 theaters and debuted at number one with $ 47 million, the lowest Pixar opening since A Bug's Life.\nWhen I asked why the film was so successful ( and has the highest grossing opening weekend in history ) The answer came in the form of what is often considered the greatest musical that Disney has made, Muppets Rock.\nIn the end, Disney had two films - The Lion King and Ratatouille - that would go on to achieve box office records, each year Disney would release two films in the summer, and one would beat the other in popularity.\nA long-time critic of Disney's summer lineup, she called the films \"overwhelming and tiresome\" and wrote in her review for The New York Time, \"It was all so predictable, so pre-packaged, so predictable,\" she said.\nIn The Hollywood Reporter, Owen Gleiberman called the release of Disney's summer line up \" a terrible mistake \", saying that \"Disney has finally settled in with a real summer lineup. No, they are not the best movies but they are not terrible movies and that is why they work as a lineup, for their predictability of summer tradition.\nThe summer film release strategy used to work, but Disney seems increasingly reluctant to embrace it. Disney has a strong focus on its own content, including the box-office bomb Mulan, and has seen declining box-office revenue in recent years.\nLast year, Disney shunned its own projects like Coco, Cruella, and Mulan, the latter of which was one of its fastest-receiving movies in China, and instead chose to release the Pixar film Soul and the live-action Mulan in the summer, which helped Soul to achieve box-office success with $ 55 million, as well as Roku, Marvel, Pixar, and Fox films, such as Deadpool 2 and the XMen sequels.\nOn the back of Soul's popularity in China, Disney released Soul there on October 10 and then released it globally on November 12, and Roku released the film on November 2, which helped the film to achieve a box-office record.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Disney announced it was ending its summer lineup after 32 years, saying that it had become \"stranded in two of the biggest stories of the year.\nThis is the second consecutive year that Disney's fall lineup is missing the Pixar film Soul by launching. Last year, Pixar's Soul was the last feature to be released by Disney in the fall, because the film had failed to build enough interest to move into the top five at the box office and thus prevent Disney from releasing the film in the summer.\nWhat is Disney to do after this summer and fall lineups? Disney will release a total of six films in 2021, with four of them in November and two in December.\nAfter Soul and Mulan both completed production in November, Disney's November releases will

They were initially a charter airline, providing flight services for the oil companies that mined in the area.\nIn 1978, the airline began an intensive search for a new name and logo.  Eventually it chose Saab ( short for Suomen Autokonvertimossa ) at first with an orange and black colour scheme.  However, the original logo had large blue \"S\" and an orange \"Y\", thus the company would later be known as SAS. There were a number of designs and colours proposed to the company before it settled on their current orange with blue trim, and blue \"S\" and \"Y\" logo.\nThe orange and blue colour scheme, first used in 1978 and later adopted for the airline's fleet and all fleet-related material in 1979, is also the colours of the Swedish Air Force, and the airline's main fleet's livery. The \"S\" and \"Y\" in Saab were a result of a contest between several Swedish companies. The \"S\" had to stand for 'Sovjetens Korpavilasjon' ('Soviet Armament Corporation') as the name of the airline's predecessor company, \" Gr\u00f8nlandsfly' \", was abbreviated to \"Gr\u00f8nfly\". \nThe \"S\" in Saab has been called \"Gr\u00f8n's\", \"G\u00f8nsen\" and other spellings as well as a \"cross\" or \"crossing\". The orange \"Y\" has been called Saab's \"eye\", and the \"S\" and \"Y\" \"sailing\". \nThe aircraft's tail number was in original order numbering, with \"S-AAF\" referring to \"Swedish Air Force.\" It was later changed to \"S-AOQ\" in honour of the then chief pilot, J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m Olof and the airline's own original company name of \"Gr\u00f8nlandsfly' \".  The \"S-AQ\" was added to the tail number around 1979, when the airline purchased an Airbus A320 (N545UA), and thus the tail number became \"S-AQO\", and later \"S-AOQ\". In October 1982, the \"Soviet aircraft company\" was changed to \"Gr\u00f8nfly' \".\nThe airline's fleet was initially composed of a DC-8-34 (S-AOY) and a turbo-propeller Cessna 172 (S-AQF). When the DC-8 was taken for restoration in the early 1980s, the Airbus A320 fleet began to get orders from SAS as replacement.\nThe airline currently uses the Airbus A320's with the registration numbers N545, N545U, N548, N548U and N551. The A320 fleet includes two Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, a Boeing 767-200LR, two Boeing 737-800s, two Boeing 737-700s and three Boeing 737-400s which are used for regional flights.","token_len":669,"entropy":[10.3915,2.9439,7.204,2.6312,5.9843,2.3043,4.2585,2.4778,8.27,5.2352,0.7071,4.7129,8.8526,5.8415,6.7182,4.1832,5.8676,1.5916,6.1053,1.7928,7.7731,1.9793,10.4611,6.6744,2.9032,1.2474,12.8919,9.6869,6.3138,6.4126,6.9211,0.8636,6.0385,1.8009,3.3172,2.0016,3.2829,9.9116,0.393,7.1703,2.0708,0.8726,6.9204,0.0634,0.0534,0.0178,8.2371,8.9589,4.945,1.8379,4.4289,1.757,0.2574,2.086,3.6291,0.3301,5.4791,1.3868,4.243,3.9152,6.8557,0.8825,1.3614,5.8727,4.9559,1.4949,2.2426,2.0468,7.1689,3.2888,3.6205,7.0307,3.7974,1.0375,1.6756,0.5791,2.4478,6.4182,5.1214,0.9487,1.5199,1.8389,3.5035,4.2448,4.2752,3.4001,0.2741,1.2995,1.2885,5.1125,2.6524,5.1399,1.1709,7.0595,13.0415,3.0733,3.9752,7.126,2.3472,3.4801,7.5204,0.1733,6.9212,5.6738,11.5397,4.8765,6.0243,11.2404,6.3069,9.8412,2.8017,1.4199,5.7639,3.5706,3.9928,3.3595,8.1199,2.3051,1.7866,3.9142,0.1392,1.2706,1.5088,3.1282,0.3128,1.6328,4.1801,1.9333,3.1199,7.1357,3.9205,4.8901,3.1332,0.559,2.6574,4.1351,1.3291,1.4792,4.8849,2.4493,5.0067,1.6625,3.2569,4.5175,2.7392,1.8323,1.9994,0.1863,6.3652,0.6778,5.9416,1.3358,2.8631,0.4436,0.0022,5.7775,2.5401,3.9459,6.5234,3.4178,2.1394,1.5795,3.7614,1.6413,4.2562,0.3556,5.2477,3.0854,7.5667,6.1528,3.6646,7.456,2.571,2.6881,4.1189,1.8378,1.0104,0.2949,1.481,1.4635,0.1922,1.0558,4.1325,0.5704,1.5592,1.8378,6.3856,1.4465,1.851,3.5882,0.1024,3.9864,5.561,1.5596,1.1858,3.1582,2.8618,2.1147,1.7077,3.4905,1.1191,2.772,1.6497,5.4326,3.5837,5.5951,5.3941,2.9839,2.1821,6.8722,3.0334,3.2361,0.223,2.2982,3.8272,3.3098,6.0817,1.6245,0.5018,5.1618,3.2853,2.062,2.9959,2.3814,2.2806,3.5787,1.4802,3.8074,3.4503,5.6349,6.6999,0.038,1.0208,2.1444,3.0932,1.6132,0.1371,1.7502,0.0961,0.1052,0.0291,4.7729,3.7749,0.0195,3.1151,4.2746,3.1465,0.0264,2.0935,7.1589,1.8878,4.6675,2.4645,2.0612,2.3699,1.7451,3.0641,0.7544,0.0671,3.7002,4.0574,4.9899,0.187,4.0401,9.8452,5.7963,8.6293,9.8854,3.4942,6.0509,6.0776,5.9284,6.7498,1.6987,3.435,5.917,8.0101,1.9799,4.8802,0.8546,4.2881,1.3097,2.7873,1.095,0.3881,3.0078,1.9478,7.287,2.1543,1.0675,5.8447,6.0275,0.0312,0.0736,0.0697,0.4316,7.6991,9.0205,3.3983,8.4255,0.0017,0.613,2.0921,2.1939,0.0392,0.1513,8.4593,2.1476,2.492,1.2751,1.4635,2.6671,0.8403,0.0566,3.2644,0.7967,0.0122,3.9002,1.6777,4.943,1.3065,4.2502,0.0254,0.1312,5.4096,3.8863,1.3022,3.9672,3.08,3.3122,4.4069,2.0133,1.1021,4.0892,7.8192,0.0002,4.4519,1.0421,1.0544,3.2736,2.7689,10.0702,2.0646,2.5265,0.7557,1.9944,3.9298,1.4005,2.0653,5.2145,1.984,2.1142,0.0459,2.4857,0.6314,2.7158,3.5602,0.1825,1.1289,0.7896,7.5343,1.356,1.778,0.8799,0.92,1.0502,0.0209,3.0031,0.0948,0.1009,0.0188,5.5599,4.1478,5.9539,2.1469,1.4914,0.4055,1.3363,4.4054,2.614,5.2712,3.144,1.5981,5.8081,6.8042,4.732,7.7625,4.1744,2.2698,2.7729,1.7973,4.8793,9.6352,0.4363,6.5667,0.0633,3.2208,4.2393,0.4749,0.0062,0.5418,0.1993,4.8409,3.3717,0.904,3.2966,0.9786,0.1454,0.5293,1.7763,0.8317,2.248,4.0292,5.897,1.6015,2.5528,5.9736,0.0085,0.7742,6.659,4.7917,1.988,1.2975,4.405,5.5994,3.3559,6.2803,0.192,0.0104,6.9216,1.5023,6.7268,1.7504,3.6669,0.3266,5.0949,5.1069,5.7986,3.5652,3.4123,1.3072,3.0517,0.0068,0.0785,0.1704,0.2243,4.4384,0.96,1.6815,2.7021,1.833,0.9904,2.5279,1.037,3.3835,0.1306,1.9761,4.4997,0.7509,0.4257,4.6829,0.1841,6.5474,3.4854,1.076,2.8737,0.9941,1.5479,5.2939,3.5766,4.712,0.7298,1.1543,4.1329,6.7404,9.6796,7.3528,2.1802,2.3439,6.0798,1.8006,4.1731,0.1003,2.954,0.8038,0.7521,0.5525,0.7909,0.1691,4.9832,2.8812,2.3082,3.3117,1.6991,0.7119,0.2893,0.6856,2.6319,0.1973,1.1541,3.4583,4.8576,2.5335,0.5923,0.7107,2.5739,10.3077,5.4027,3.0548,0.6892,2.5089,5.0718,0.2604,1.1409,3.8398,0.0034,0.0664,5.6265,1.4774,1.8492,1.1171,1.2974,3.0685,1.3937,3.0974,1.7817,3.5909,3.8532,0.1238,3.0779,10.4249,0.6367,2.6048,4.4088,5.8984,2.5231,3.9824,0.7475,1.6592,9.042,1.3539,1.1643,0.6927,9.4094,1.2474,4.2561,2.0486,0.0084,3.8553,2.976,0.022,2.7971,0.8921,1.1468,0.2164,0.6412,3.4691,4.8217,0.9315,5.3917,0.6477,6.2377,0.0484,0.0334,2.0763,4.8128,6.9517,5.0205,0.5998,3.6765,1.5959,0.7891,0.1456,0.2708,0.735,6.0536,0.6073,0.6038,6.3687,4.4429,0.3864,4.7015,7.0444,2.0488,7.8211,3.6402,6.9391,2.0211,2.0942,1.3484,4.0847,5.8597,3.7399,1.231,4.8718,0.3471,1.3024,4.5928,6.8071,1.753,8.3744,4.4156,4.5067,2.8296,3.8579,0.4023,1.347,2.3143,0.7009,0.2639,5.2145,0.9594,0.3465,1.5396,0.8434,1.4869,0.3203,4.3056,1.1433,1.8132,2.4048,0.3793,2.6542,5.0794,2.765,4.0104,1.3991,1.238,1.785,1.9353,2.4964,0.1188,1.1579,1.8267,1.2524,0.5891,1.9909,0.5222,2.2311,5.3472,1.455,3.1002,1.0142,2.5196,0.5128,0.326,3.8108,0.6518,1.4448,0.5079,2.4909,0.2819,2.8779,0.5876,1.0497,2.9616,0.4368,2.4646,0.1917,3.1682,0.4603,5.9014,0.9903,3.5853,1.6951,6.5994,2.4223,0.7227]}

He apparently never informed his parents, whose daughter at the time was only one-months old, of his decision. Following his father's consent, Pitman enlisted and transferred into the artillery.\nPitman's service in the Union Army ended as he was stationed in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, from August to December 1862. At the end of the Civil War, Pitman returned to Michigan, and resumed his medical studies. He earned his medical degree in 1866 at the University of Michigan Medical School. At this time, many of the students enrolled at the Medical School were young women.\nOn June 7, 1869, Pitman married Susan Huggins, a student at the Medical School.\nPitman completed a one-year internship at the Michigan State Hospital after his graduation. Pitman served as the director of the State Hospital between 1872 and 1874. Pitman's students included two future U.S. governors: William Stanley Jr and John Titor.\nAt the hospital, Pitman met his future mentor John Harvey Kellogg and became interested in developing the health education and adult vocational training programs.\nIn 1874, Pitman accepted a position as a professor at the Medical School in the College of Michigan. At the time Michigan was home to one institution of higher learning which was not associated with a medical school: the College of Natural Science. Despite holding this appointment, Pitman continued as the State Superintendent as well as the director of the State Hospital. It was during this time that Pitman began to experiment with a vocational program.\nDue to its success, Pitman recruited the hospital to expand upon its vocational program. The facility began offering courses in agriculture and animal husbandry, which were to serve as its early vocational programs. These courses were taught by the hospital's veterinaries, the late John V. Horner and Louis F. Darr, who were also active members of the Kellogg Alumni Association.\nOther courses offered by the center were in elementary education, aided by other faculty members from neighboring institutions such as the University of Michigan College of Education and the Michigan College of Natural Science.\nIn 1879, Pitman was asked to assume the post of the first Director of the General Board of Education in Michigan. He served as the first person to head the body for almost thirty years. In 1883, he proposed the use of a common school curriculum which would be adopted in the new standardized public schools. The program was finally adopted in 1891. The school standard curricula have been adopted in many states around the country. Pitman also helped to pass legislation making vocational education available for students. Although he retired from office in 1895, he remained active in education at the local and national level. Between 1895 and 1915, Pitman served as President of the American Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\nA few months before his death, Pitman suffered a stroke and died in his hometown of Grand Rapids. After his funeral, a collection of funds was organized in his honor to be used to create the Pitman College in Grand Rapids.\nPitman was buried in the Forest View Cemetery in Grand Rapids.","token_len":669,"entropy":[7.6946,3.4513,0.3001,7.5616,0.1638,11.0242,3.3108,5.1106,7.0192,4.3896,2.4341,4.379,3.5628,2.0172,1.3634,7.1444,1.0346,2.2109,0.7582,0.3979,3.3997,0.7172,4.307,5.434,0.7492,0.8258,4.2313,0.3061,0.0016,0.2058,1.532,8.0007,3.6188,8.2972,0.358,2.244,2.4048,5.3349,4.7362,6.2963,0.6399,0.0102,0.6967,3.6965,5.1387,3.334,6.3968,2.1009,0.8747,1.2656,0.4045,2.4683,1.0047,6.5005,1.0961,4.6619,0.019,11.0693,0.4186,0.8136,0.002,2.5339,2.7259,6.8386,4.3298,0.153,6.3766,1.8071,1.7616,10.1516,0.0127,0.0004,1.4136,3.967,1.1983,0.101,2.0865,0.0923,4.2869,4.5572,1.8588,1.2276,5.4843,0.7183,2.4458,4.96,0.0372,4.1305,1.263,0.4734,0.8447,5.1403,2.2069,3.4158,1.9542,1.0996,0.2983,3.9334,1.0425,1.381,0.0034,1.5563,3.3387,0.001,0.1891,1.5396,0.0013,3.1254,0.2779,6.9952,1.581,3.3552,6.6393,0.5122,6.0592,3.3303,0.6387,1.5915,4.9281,1.3675,2.3695,0.2603,1.2456,1.8284,2.8637,1.8465,0.8419,0.61,0.0054,0.553,1.47,0.5668,1.0124,4.1327,2.5693,0.6338,0.2156,5.1182,1.5036,1.2367,4.7564,5.9983,1.8384,0.8376,4.1226,0.3645,1.4986,4.8358,3.3092,1.8105,1.9776,4.0096,3.0001,3.5415,0.0234,0.8891,2.762,0.0335,0.9193,0.0018,3.9757,4.6772,4.3563,5.7805,0.0331,0.8851,1.4671,4.1463,0.8819,0.3777,2.2732,0.0244,0.6393,3.1314,1.891,0.0103,0.0009,5.5723,2.9887,6.2293,0.5645,0.1578,3.666,0.8867,0.4404,2.8012,2.7052,2.3755,4.8856,2.4813,2.8455,1.0488,2.8257,0.0031,3.6456,1.3083,2.5872,4.3953,0.0851,0.7505,5.175,1.1691,6.9125,1.3277,2.9315,0.0579,0.1901,1.4909,0.4853,2.6411,0.0025,2.1593,7.6012,1.4725,4.234,6.6418,3.4843,0.0526,0.0315,0.0052,6.7453,2.4628,2.8402,8.9887,6.2085,6.2419,2.6475,4.9993,11.0123,0.593,1.0378,4.2494,0.6161,5.4133,0.2475,0.293,0.0021,3.9076,1.992,1.5841,7.0569,4.3733,7.2129,7.6445,0.0124,2.6561,2.7214,3.7218,0.0123,5.033,2.6205,4.9733,6.1965,2.9558,9.4497,7.0114,0.4456,1.3382,1.7202,2.2641,1.9491,1.0102,1.8917,0.0721,0.8538,0.002,5.8968,0.8795,1.3491,0.9845,1.2749,3.9395,1.1875,0.3594,3.2255,0.0914,2.7848,2.3026,3.4577,0.1597,6.4638,0.7073,3.5017,0.6729,0.8619,9.8461,1.6917,3.6811,0.0208,3.7622,11.4145,0.6738,0.4821,1.0023,5.6229,1.0013,4.4489,5.2338,0.0223,3.5313,2.0589,0.4351,2.1341,0.3647,2.9336,0.0228,5.0835,3.2518,0.3901,5.5592,7.4509,3.3011,5.5529,0.5316,0.4259,0.002,3.605,4.7806,2.4092,7.3348,5.5245,5.6176,2.147,0.1529,1.8717,3.0447,0.0691,0.2494,3.1873,0.8372,0.5844,5.4112,0.4177,1.1556,0.4887,0.5088,0.2299,0.8199,0.0021,2.517,0.8888,5.673,0.1964,3.4712,6.8618,2.6228,1.1504,1.1161,6.3353,0.0045,5.2385,5.4305,0.6608,1.0241,0.0031,7.3869,3.5244,8.3275,4.3804,3.9836,5.8488,1.0199,5.8013,1.6258,0.6597,2.348,4.3867,3.8867,2.8575,3.4537,0.8156,5.8485,1.1762,4.6704,0.6859,0.0014,1.5302,3.3892,2.3216,4.5773,3.5312,0.3718,6.1768,6.7724,5.1235,1.6785,0.2276,4.6296,0.4774,1.3685,3.8651,0.8197,2.4761,4.1544,0.2727,5.0591,9.7553,1.5145,4.295,7.7641,3.0942,5.5529,0.8854,6.7293,2.497,1.7626,6.1598,3.8481,0.2911,4.5585,5.939,2.0128,1.8071,1.6033,1.8013,4.9439,3.0108,0.0729,0.2806,9.482,0.0035,9.0394,0.0962,0.3124,0.3317,1.6594,7.3138,2.2979,1.7919,0.9925,0.1927,6.7788,2.0146,4.6955,7.0991,1.8857,0.4331,10.211,0.1361,5.3242,3.3645,1.0857,3.2279,6.2937,2.2521,1.993,0.0038,0.3981,1.1273,0.0209,0.4759,3.8237,0.0512,5.3139,1.2113,0.3097,1.7508,3.3168,0.0187,4.0028,1.3903,0.214,1.4583,1.9247,1.1292,3.1569,0.0974,0.4494,0.002,2.3226,5.4963,0.3083,5.7114,0.4705,2.8115,0.04,3.7902,4.2269,3.9653,0.0727,0.2544,4.3897,6.0095,0.2065,2.9936,2.4979,2.663,0.4262,1.8486,4.2413,1.3667,0.9602,1.7934,5.1937,0.7255,6.1085,0.5212,6.7434,2.3311,7.1679,3.7972,0.0994,0.5712,2.4329,1.5468,2.1006,0.1098,1.1609,6.9277,2.1795,6.4837,0.0215,2.5359,6.7475,3.5375,2.5185,3.3748,1.5637,2.0778,4.0585,2.4543,1.2185,3.2008,9.1238,3.6771,1.4093,0.6161,2.2568,4.4908,1.2957,4.9147,0.8371,1.1391,1.2423,2.8741,0.8667,2.7621,3.0103,8.9928,5.5848,0.0249,4.4624,1.1211,2.3243,1.6642,3.439,2.0351,4.6726,0.0027,0.5875,0.7697,1.8967,0.0022,3.2815,4.8686,1.7254,4.7427,2.3509,3.7957,6.6612,1.0381,2.7169,2.5779,3.5187,2.8405,5.454,1.8083,6.3567,1.1706,5.5419,0.4148,3.6306,0.0938,1.2969,1.9636,1.4888,0.2572,3.9228,3.9403,0.3065,5.6388,1.8768,1.3345,0.6625,0.5168,7.0002,2.0721,0.0488,4.8417,0.0949,1.0312,0.0022,1.8478,0.3239,3.2173,0.1994,0.1932,2.89,1.7685,0.2934,2.7924,0.5649,11.6785,0.354,1.0535,0.9334,4.4108,2.6002,3.1244,1.4796,0.8466,0.8492,0.3887,0.5184,0.0018,6.8032,0.5111,0.7548,1.9078,1.1935,1.5937,1.8948,3.6769,0.1406,5.4474,0.0638,1.6985,4.8947,1.3021,3.9645,0.2995,3.1589,6.0136,0.0429,8.1146,1.8782,4.4603,3.0469,1.633,0.5946,1.8713,4.203,0.8274,0.5784,4.2604,1.7932,4.5259,0.0081,5.0749,4.0079,0.5624,0.0021,0.5361,1.5905,1.8527,0.0156,0.0011,1.5751,1.9231,1.0065,1.204,8.1324,5.7425,0.0405,1.1155,1.3914,0.0113,1.7053]}
{"prompt":"Invisible rail = The invisible rail , Wallace 's rail , or drummer rail ( Habroptila < unk > ) is a large flightless rail that is endemic to the island of Halmahera in North","text":"Invisible rail = The invisible rail, Wallace's rail, or drummer rail ( Habroptila < unk > ) is a large flightless rail that is endemic to the island of Halmahera in North Maluku, Indonesia. This large bird is only found on Halmahera where it lives in the lowland dipterocarp habitat. The species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.\nThe largest flightless rail in the world! These birds are found in only two islands in Indonesia, where they have been protected from hunting for more than 25 years. One, the famous Halmahera bird, is an iconic figure in North Maluku's popular tourist resorts. The other, the little-known Sabudo bird, is now protected by law. They are also highly prized by birds of any nationality.\nWe can easily be misled into believing that the world of bird conservation has achieved great success due to the rapid increase in protected sites around the world. However, this impression is misleading because not all protected areas are truly effective. Indeed, it has only been very recently that we have become aware of the importance of designing effective management regimes for protected areas and the requirement to do so before they are opened up to the public.\nThis book provides a unique insight into what goes on in those areas and why it is important that we do it. The authors are from a number of disciplines, with one part of the book dealing with the social and cultural aspect of conservations, which is very important to understanding the issues within the regions. An equally important aspect, perhaps more so than the social aspect, is the fact that there is an abundance of information contained within the book. The data contained is fascinating and unique and is certainly a reference point for anyone wishing to go further into the field. This book covers a large number of issues under different aspects, such as the flora, fauna, vegetation, environment, conservation, and the people. These themes form a fascinating mix not only within this volume, but also other books, which, in the future, will also be available to us in an electronic format. I cannot emphasise enough how important we need to have this book in our libraries, as well as electronic access to it via the Internet. While it is important that we educate our citizens about the importance of protecting the environment and its creatures, the key factor in achieving this is in having the will and capability to enforce the law and keep track of the activities of unscrupulous operators. We need to put in place some very effective guidelines for the operation of any protected area. The key to creating a protected area with a sustainable management regime is for the people within these areas to take real ownership of it. This can only happen when there is a real sense of responsibility within the area; these areas are not just places where there is legislation, but where members of the communities can live and enjoy the beauty of the land being protected. If we do not do this, even with the most effective conservation area on earth, we will never achieve what we hope to.\nA fascinating book, with an interesting mix of different subjects relating to the environment and conservation.

{"prompt":"The Vietnam War , was a conflict between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( < unk > , DRV or North Vietnam ) and the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN or South Vietnam ) ,","text":"The Vietnam War, was a conflict between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( < unk >, DRV or North Vietnam ) and the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN or South Vietnam ), fought in Southeast Asia between December 1, 1945 and July 30, 1975. The conflict was fought primarily on the mainland of Vietnam, with a smaller number of battles occurring in the central and western regions as well as Cambodia.\nIn November 1975, Vietnam reunified under the rule of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), which led to a period of civil unrest after its capture of Saigon. In March 1976, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France began a campaign of air strikes against North Vietnam to support the democratic South Vietnamese government. However, the campaign failed to stop the North from taking control of Ho Chi Minh City, leaving the democratic government in jeopardy.\nIn January 1977, Prime Minister Nguyen Van Thieu requested a U.S. intervention, which ultimately led to the conclusion of the Paris Peace Accords negotiated by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\nFollowing the agreement, President Gerald Ford declared the French\u2013American war officially over on May 16, 1978 to the delight of the Vietnamese. However, several North Vietnamese bases were taken and American soldiers and equipment were left in North Vietnam. In 1979, the French and U.S. invaded the South in a new war called the Gulf War, which lasted another 13 months.\nIn September 1979, the Vietnam Communist Party seized Saigon. In October, President Jimmy Carter began his so-called War on Terror. The following month saw the United States move troops from South Vietnam to northern Cambodia, and on November 29, the US invaded the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh and took over the city, setting the groundwork for the collapse of the government. The North Vietnamese withdrew unconditionally from Saigon on August 17, 1979. From July to August that year, North Vietnam was occupied by North Vietnamese (VN) forces under the command of Pol Pot.\nFrom 1975 to 1978, there were nearly three million VC forces in Vietnam, although they had lost over 1,100,000 killed and\/or captured. The VC also continued their activities in Cambodia (under the Khmer Rouge ) and Laos (under the Khmer Liberation Army ).\nFrom 1961 to 1973, over 1 million Chinese workers volunteered to help build infrastructure in Vietnam, while also training Vietnamese for their own industrial expansion. These Chinese workers built several railroads and ports, roads, bridges, schools, and a communications system. In 1973, Vietnam reached a deal with China for a trade tie-up.

He made the surprise decision to change his name to Lawton and remained with the club for six years before he decided to move to England and play for West Bromwich Albion as an apprentice.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\n\nLawton joined West Bromwich Albion in 1952. He made his league debut for West Bromwich Albion on 9 November 1952 at home to Sheffield Wednesday by playing the full 90 minutes of a 1-1 draw.\nIn 1953 Lawton scored his 1st goal in a League match as West Bromwich Albion beat Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road and secured a 2-0 win in the cup.\nHe had his first spell with the club in 1951. In his first season as a professional, in May 1951, while playing for North Ferriby, he was charged by police with assault and battery. Following the arrest, they discovered a bottle of whisky in his glove compartment. He had his first spell with the Club in the 1950s; scoring three goals and getting seven games and two cup penalties.\nDuring this time with the Club he also represented Wales on the professional team.\nIn 1957 Lawton transferred to Everton, on a three-year loan deal. His first match for Everton at Goodison Park was in a game against Southport in 1957. The club manager, Alf Ramsey, gave him the number nine shirt, which he wore throughout his career at Everton. After seven months with Everton, where he played 45 games, Lawton returned to West Bromwich.\nIn his second spell with West Brom, he was involved in a tense fight with his manager, Dick Smith, during a game in March 1960. Smith argued he wanted to see all five substitutes changed; one would have to remain on the field of play until the end of the game. Lawton took command and refused to move until all five players were replaced. He had one spell in the 1966 FA Cup; he scored twice in a match against Brentford after the two scores had been nullified owing to off field handball.\n\nNotts County and retirement\n\nOn 14 September 1971, Lawton moved to Notts County for a fee of \u00a3 5,000. He played for the newly promoted Second Division side in his 2nd season in his new position, but was not much of a factor, and left the club after only 15 games.\nIn 1972 Lawton retired from professional football, aged 37.\n\nInternational\n\nHe was called up for four times for England, in 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957. He was released from his first spell by Alf Ramsey, before returning for South Africa in his second spell to replace Bill Smith after he injured his knee.

The blue means the blue sea and the white is the white clouds. The five stars stand for the 5 original colonies that Maryland is named for: Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.\nThe symbolism of the colors in Maryland was the same as it was in the original Confederate flag. The colors in Maryland and the colors symbolized the three states of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia.\nThe first flag of the state of Massachusetts was a simple version of the current American presidential flag. The stars and stripes of the blue, white, and red was similar to the colors of the Confederacy flag.\nThe colors, blue, white, and red, have a similar meaning to the colors in the flag of the state of Maryland. The five star and the red stars represent the five original colonies, Massachusetts, New England, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York.\nThe State of Massachusetts had two flags that were both accepted under the state constitution, and the flag chosen over the other flag was the traditional colors of Massachusetts, blue, green, and gold. Blue represents oceans and blue sky, green represents the fields. The gold represents the gold fields in the state.","token_len":675,"entropy":[9.2298,7.7449,13.8854,2.9433,7.0291,8.0613,2.1845,6.0241,1.8935,2.0027,0.4423,2.0128,4.9125,0.8426,1.8702,2.9015,3.9576,6.3865,1.2542,7.6044,2.5069,3.5401,1.2715,1.1076,3.5667,0.7501,6.7617,8.9566,0.0056,6.2526,0.6618,2.0708,1.3739,5.9634,0.7202,0.554,4.0421,1.6053,3.3614,0.6997,1.5932,11.4698,2.3594,4.5157,2.4378,0.0204,1.3994,3.3387,7.8425,1.2765,2.5472,5.2113,1.8614,7.2157,2.0046,1.2224,8.962,0.589,0.0001,2.6584,2.7523,2.4618,2.0355,2.9451,1.2066,0.0114,6.0912,1.5243,2.7428,0.2224,0.6736,5.8474,4.5084,8.7467,4.0692,5.4035,1.1156,4.8757,0.8023,2.9488,1.9368,0.3198,3.4499,3.7216,2.341,3.6402,0.2145,3.0377,1.94,1.0134,7.6671,3.6639,1.4699,4.5145,0.0088,0.7342,5.2706,0.0077,4.3838,2.3316,1.8556,4.8177,0.277,5.1992,4.2529,0.7924,1.3172,2.0882,3.1907,0.7003,0.1537,0.663,4.0793,0.0311,2.9821,5.8061,1.4446,2.6965,1.2683,3.358,9.2167,3.3751,0.9539,8.1843,1.5206,3.8161,3.9215,1.2581,10.2001,0.0338,2.7156,1.0448,4.4827,2.0452,4.3376,0.284,4.1591,0.1355,0.445,0.9874,4.4432,6.1288,1.2372,0.8173,6.2082,0.2087,0.3046,3.7894,1.2427,3.2399,1.419,2.4079,4.5814,1.1056,1.7356,0.254,7.8897,0.3245,4.5546,1.9443,4.975,0.4027,0.3344,0.0698,0.5593,8.0603,4.7158,0.0019,0.3596,6.9377,0.4696,3.6741,0.5716,1.1181,3.607,0.0503,2.6984,0.3474,1.4215,5.7158,0.3373,0.3199,3.8793,0.1546,1.712,1.5932,1.2892,0.7452,0.8664,4.174,0.8437,3.5594,0.9736,1.0076,5.9507,0.8235,0.0941,1.8175,1.7786,5.1388,0.415,3.0179,0.6543,5.5004,6.4848,0.0466,1.4354,2.2774,7.7535,4.6514,1.2796,1.9008,2.8243,6.1576,7.3705,0.001,0.0003,1.5332,0.4212,5.0799,2.1631,1.6444,0.9597,1.2872,8.4782,4.0993,0.1502,4.118,0.7648,2.1006,1.2918,4.0374,0.0481,1.5895,2.1217,1.9604,2.9007,2.8695,0.3178,0.3404,0.2013,0.2301,0.0117,0.8314,1.0437,4.6687,3.0903,7.4227,0.005,0.0029,0.0079,0.0395,1.4487,4.4753,1.3192,5.4206,1.8836,1.673,1.3442,4.2144,3.5019,1.1441,9.2368,1.0392,0.6605,8.1082,4.7589,2.6231,1.7434,0.8918,1.4984,6.6725,8.8908,4.2961,2.5674,6.725,2.4651,1.2052,2.5963,5.4387,0.6504,0.4968,1.0309,1.0806,2.1279,1.3351,0.3488,2.7533,0.2043,4.8511,1.5193,4.1796,0.0293,0.2022,5.1547,5.4546,9.1005,4.4607,1.8147,5.9386,3.4742,3.8171,0.0818,3.0149,2.3722,0.197,1.1249,3.2388,9.1094,0.6817,0.4653,4.5625,0.0406,2.599,1.9229,2.4505,2.1379,4.1509,1.9276,4.6027,0.6114,1.266,4.5041,5.7963,2.2761,1.4759,0.9505,5.8115,1.8824,3.0905,2.5397,0.0623,0.6743,6.1121,6.8389,2.2855,1.5012,3.8714,6.1111,0.0529,0.4286,3.5877,0.7278,1.6369,0.3568,2.6487,1.5498,0.7574,1.0154,0.0901,0.6063,0.6742,2.2432,0.0222,0.4744,3.9168,0.0812,4.7456,4.8658,1.3583,0.4662,5.6078,0.0765,2.56,3.0854,0.7648,1.0184,1.8773,0.1769,0.3776,0.5683,0.0013,3.8568,0.7618,1.9942,7.2954,0.4784,0.0265,0.0776,5.1031,1.4104,1.2707,0.5347,0.7019,0.0099,0.5948,0.6035,3.2731,1.3495,0.0631,1.3894,0.8129,3.6208,0.2088,0.8817,0.0981,0.7723,4.3984,4.0221,1.9553,0.6275,1.5192,2.971,2.3339,0.344,0.3925,3.2358,3.6157,0.1539,1.8198,1.1922,0.2143,0.7923,4.7516,1.7956,0.0977,2.0248,0.5063,0.2085,0.2647,0.0275,0.479,2.6806,1.7688,7.1034,3.1072,1.3428,2.1324,3.5467,6.2427,5.2369,0.042,1.0291,7.49,2.8524,5.2268,0.6866,1.1631,3.7025,6.1203,1.7698,3.6308,4.4323,2.3798,0.5335,1.0967,2.2462,0.3475,0.9715,7.2626,0.7273,1.004,6.9982,1.6822,4.7682,0.0517,0.3498,6.0397,8.8069,2.8029,3.6529,8.3029,2.8528,1.8082,0.7844,1.7332,4.1597,0.3211,3.0783,0.0185,3.5726,0.0642,4.7167,0.0676,0.3673,5.0686,0.0598,0.6976,0.8655,7.6624,0.2371,0.207,4.5249,1.3241,4.2949,3.7948,3.7328,1.9185,0.2105,2.9185,0.8664,0.1933,0.7363,4.3754,5.0115,0.6385,0.6059,0.7363,2.1406,2.1402,2.5966,4.1794,1.1241,4.0268,8.0981,1.2114,0.6395,4.3633,2.2739,1.6618,1.9634,1.6051,2.4681,0.0565,0.556,0.9592,0.5236,1.0341,0.9121,4.6132,2.3521,0.9236,0.1971,1.6311,0.0492,4.1261,0.4015,2.7653,3.0893,4.1915,0.0287,0.066,3.0726,5.0924,9.2595,0.3763,0.8741,0.5315,5.711,2.2184,0.5102,1.8348,0.0954,4.2381,2.1426,0.0962,0.1704,0.1624,1.0048,6.2638,4.6969,0.0761,0.2532,2.6228,0.6652,0.2122,5.5961,3.8868,0.5943,1.473,0.6181,3.5446,6.2136,5.4341,0.0768,0.2682,0.0725,0.0776,0.7247,1.2295,3.9278,2.2393,2.6516,0.6108,0.5913,0.2097,2.1553,1.1601,0.1948,2.0436,0.0968,0.3397,0.606,0.01,1.7043,0.3452,0.8922,3.779,3.2624,4.4636,2.5579,2.3631,2.2651,1.8661,0.2999,1.0448,0.3405,0.1874,3.0859,4.3298,0.0587,2.2513,3.2298,0.0507,1.7779,0.0025,0.0391,3.2125,0.0415,0.8824,1.827,0.4314,0.2024,0.7566,0.588,5.0208,0.2278,1.3355,4.1826,2.8085,2.556,2.5214,0.9002,4.5042,7.1863,5.5037,0.2874,2.5308,0.9539,2.5943,2.4596,1.4328,2.2631,8.173,5.9127,0.4388,2.3096,3.2987,0.5615,1.3979,5.7206,6.464,0.3279,3.6031,2.5865,5.6107,0.0835,5.8966,0.038,0.5946,4.109,0.0771,7.9979,4.0007,11.238,1.0585,3.6064,9.5819,1.559,3.0729,0.2548,2.0127,7.0523,5.1959,0.6406,5.949,1.3434,0.7605,3.7236,2.664,3.228,0.6973,2.3843,1.2105]}
{"prompt":"The first factor in the decline of the kakapo was the arrival of humans . M\u0101ori folklore suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years","text":"The first factor in the decline of the kakapo was the arrival of humans. M\u0101ori folklore suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago \u2013 and we don't know for sure, of course. It was first believed by the Australians to have been introduced to Tasmania after the European settlement began in 1788. But a comprehensive molecular study recently published shows that the kakapo didn't arrive on mainland Australia until at least 1480 AD, and that the bird was extinct there until the 1850s.\nThe second factor has to do with the loss of food sources. Before the arrival of humans, all of the birds' natural habitats lay on the Pacific coast. And when Europeans began to populate Aotearoa, most of the food on which they ate still came from up the coast. Since New Zealand has an island chain stretching 1,200 kilometers (800 miles) across the Pacific, and the only food source inland was the sparse agriculture of islands so far from each other as Rarotonga and M\u0101naka, the only place the birds could be found was up that coast. If you go down to the depths of this coastline, you will have to go about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the south coast to find the first island where the birds could rest.\nNow, to the beginning of the 20th century, the landscape had changed dramatically. By 1800 AD, Aotearoa was more urbanised than at any time since the time the Europeans established settlement. By then, a great number of agricultural farmers on Aotearoa, and many of their families had moved to towns to work in industry. Those farmers had left the coast in favour of these towns. As a result, the only food source available to the birds was the vegetation that was growing near the far end of the main chains of islands near the Tasman Bay. If you can stand the trek there, you might even find the little birds.\nBut because those islands were being urbanised, farmers had to abandon them, moving their farms elsewhere, leaving them to go extinct. The third important factor here was that as the plants disappeared, they disappeared from their traditional diet. Now, it's very easy for humans to go out to sea and take thousands of litres of seaweed, because as humans we love nutrition, and that's what we buy in supermarkets. But the birds had a much more restricted diet. They only ate the seaweed that was growing on beaches, in rock crevices and in rocks on the coast. The very last time that this occurred was 200 years ago, so there is no more seaweed.\nThe fourth element was pollution. Over the past decade, there has been increasing pressure in New Zealand's major cities over what should be called environmental racism. Here, as elsewhere across the Pacific, people still think that when it comes to environmental degradation, Maoris, and Polynesians in general, are to blame for the impacts that it causes. So as humans have encroached further and further into the environment, they have introduced a range of pollutants, particularly heavy metals and pesticides. Most of the major contaminants, for centuries, have been coming in from the land. But it only took 70 years to transfer that pollution into our oceans.","token_len":675,"entropy":[5.3423,8.0946,2.4192,2.1602,5.9881,0.8756,1.7762,7.626,6.262,1.4309,2.1602,1.0513,4.8143,0.0447,6.4941,1.6157,7.2034,4.2764,0.2449,8.7603,4.0982,0.1781,1.2662,2.0038,0.0502,0.0179,1.3498,5.5215,4.026,0.7654,4.6465,4.5449,1.189,8.0506,0.0059,0.8807,2.1967,1.2989,1.5513,6.9155,0.9226,0.0138,0.0001,8.7761,0.4937,0.12,6.0513,2.3796,5.3784,3.3724,0.0011,0.8544,2.4743,0.1999,3.5693,4.3679,0.0068,0.8842,3.4492,2.1869,4.508,4.4419,2.3954,1.4316,6.1204,2.0843,1.2179,0.9009,4.0922,1.3362,6.0388,3.7516,0.8617,5.7715,2.8817,6.664,1.3899,3.3288,4.2917,0.5845,2.5388,4.0593,7.1735,9.7164,0.9084,6.711,1.4568,7.3944,0.361,1.1558,0.9586,0.0055,0.0055,4.6954,0.0002,3.5582,4.1636,3.8623,0.5583,0.8879,2.9033,0.0013,4.6091,4.5685,2.2942,1.2291,2.0842,1.5354,1.6674,8.8422,1.9065,4.2345,4.259,3.2251,1.678,5.1117,0.011,0.2326,0.8761,11.2156,3.2262,0.1049,5.2639,1.0485,0.0407,0.0093,0.9565,5.4547,0.0159,5.5398,2.5942,1.2089,5.0901,0.867,1.1617,0.0088,0.67,0.4552,5.4747,2.2854,0.5099,4.7715,4.3689,4.5576,2.766,7.007,2.3157,1.9697,4.9984,0.7227,1.1439,3.9131,3.6251,4.9873,3.3007,1.3028,4.9341,4.7937,0.0013,0.008,0.0062,0.6643,4.099,0.1776,0.4978,4.3106,3.5522,4.2281,1.3464,3.9701,7.6229,2.9371,0.087,8.2862,4.5958,0.4561,0.6634,5.274,7.2973,0.3462,3.5052,3.5716,2.8899,3.9521,3.5482,6.4959,0.339,2.4668,3.1363,1.0285,4.1219,0.0407,0.2995,3.0896,2.6854,1.0028,0.9614,3.242,1.8284,4.2759,2.3637,1.2643,5.1339,0.8822,1.8152,7.6829,10.0648,0.6927,4.7309,6.7468,2.1575,1.8552,6.8457,0.0042,6.5437,8.5738,3.4514,2.1717,0.3173,1.5774,5.0587,0.1381,5.1411,4.5293,0.8986,1.2909,3.8622,3.368,3.4352,0.8926,0.9135,2.8883,0.3328,1.5768,6.0233,6.2809,1.2565,0.3853,4.5562,2.6177,3.3644,2.6751,1.7367,1.3866,6.049,0.1007,4.8123,5.1,0.5384,0.7536,2.2359,5.18,1.2023,2.7849,5.5603,4.5144,1.0961,0.3315,2.7745,0.0219,0.0471,3.1415,1.1607,7.043,2.0446,1.1535,0.6546,1.7136,3.3137,6.1862,4.6093,1.1415,1.2472,1.5188,6.0587,0.5803,0.8928,4.8732,0.9996,4.3234,2.6417,7.6909,0.6624,0.5835,3.947,0.0049,0.0636,0.1493,1.4974,7.8244,4.2935,0.6645,1.7722,0.3979,4.6433,4.171,6.4913,0.2146,5.7004,0.008,0.0116,0.0067,0.7129,5.0502,6.7103,2.093,1.1251,3.8928,0.0488,0.207,1.0827,0.6315,4.387,3.3714,2.7769,5.5295,3.2641,1.5978,3.3619,3.1814,0.274,3.8342,4.3282,2.6572,0.0616,5.4069,6.5404,5.694,3.5351,0.0023,0.0137,0.0015,3.9257,2.3518,2.7088,1.334,2.3871,4.3413,2.8805,1.3555,0.9818,5.0782,4.2012,2.9662,1.0984,5.601,0.6587,5.6798,1.7925,2.2092,5.3865,1.8538,4.2135,3.1767,4.4564,0.0033,7.7557,2.7266,2.1942,3.8553,1.5446,0.0926,0.1885,1.2541,5.5548,1.6426,0.9343,3.8751,1.3301,0.8816,1.094,0.5006,1.5232,5.3468,2.719,1.7377,3.2436,4.7585,0.6475,6.5448,2.041,0.0787,0.2031,6.5543,9.2191,1.1846,3.0469,5.8728,0.9574,7.1302,5.3195,0.6161,4.682,0.646,4.3634,6.5153,2.4905,7.501,6.3118,0.9163,0.8054,3.3361,2.9733,1.8209,2.3644,6.5946,3.4968,1.9914,0.6357,3.3392,5.3782,5.2649,2.5008,0.5444,5.7216,9.2005,0.0837,0.6736,5.5599,2.241,0.3791,4.6002,3.8847,2.5759,5.6432,2.5219,2.6556,3.3444,2.3848,2.9708,2.2493,1.3633,4.5253,5.5375,0.7515,2.1237,5.927,6.6577,0.1732,6.4476,1.3036,2.1545,5.1668,1.325,6.7175,5.577,0.5211,3.0113,3.6173,1.5571,4.6127,4.3591,3.9682,0.5617,5.2344,0.9668,3.7735,1.3122,3.8324,3.0338,2.0786,3.2185,0.0713,4.0849,3.3821,2.6949,2.848,1.1079,4.0116,7.9393,0.0848,8.5257,0.0743,3.75,2.1587,2.5565,5.3052,5.0374,4.0474,1.9551,6.6516,9.9809,1.711,0.9638,3.4606,0.4827,1.1573,0.9818,5.9971,2.4281,0.9931,0.678,1.5106,2.5834,2.1337,3.5585,3.765,3.2065,2.1934,5.8649,0.2118,1.2045,1.8071,4.1578,1.0612,2.628,2.4174,0.0478,1.2358,0.8689,2.8249,1.6625,6.1842,1.3626,3.3163,6.328,2.8459,0.0111,0.0217,1.319,1.6557,3.6524,3.3062,0.6821,1.9559,0.5468,2.6865,6.5692,3.2558,4.5417,2.6471,4.2927,4.25,0.6508,5.1394,0.402,0.0322,1.0224,4.532,2.9199,2.2654,1.3651,6.1629,1.6582,0.0013,3.3185,1.0636,2.1265,1.2075,5.9346,1.9041,7.3395,0.2835,5.0819,0.5049,1.7605,4.1248,0.5001,2.8754,0.6643,0.0252,4.1984,4.086,4.8098,4.3418,0.0294,2.8504,5.4484,0.666,5.1414,4.1114,4.2197,0.2242,3.478,4.9938,6.1051,0.3909,5.8903,0.8608,3.9912,2.5154,5.3796,0.3434,1.6225,0.1341,2.471,6.5099,3.1267,0.7878,5.0842,3.0538,0.031,0.0085,3.1579,2.9563,0.2832,9.5738,4.3541,3.4044,3.2073,6.5561,0.0012,0.1288,5.5128,2.6481,1.2373,4.5221,5.354,0.1006,2.6116,1.4557,6.8639,2.892,5.515,4.0848,0.4425,3.9224,4.8101,5.7628,2.5396,5.0036,0.0132,3.2075,1.7706,0.0873,1.5104,1.1668,3.3799,0.2505,2.3262,0.6872,5.7329,2.1436,4.6491,0.0013,2.8644,2.1582,4.3415,3.9201,0.0523,1.3093,2.2606,1.2488,5.2118,0.4781,1.6862,3.8791,5.6738,2.9021,4.8141,7.4706,0.2464,0.8535,0.3252,4.7555,4.5793,0.6063,0.8651,4.6549,1.684,2.4061,3.9717,5.868,0.8365,6.0887,0.1984,2.7636,8.6557,3.2408,1.6163,1.6834,2.8444,3.2732,0.8082]}
{"prompt":"The American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942 caught the Japanese by surprise . The next day , the light carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d joined the sister ships in the First Carrier Division ,","text":"The American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942 caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, the light carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d joined the sister ships in the First Carrier Division, and the new force began its strategic advance on the south-western half of the island of Tulagi. The carrier was maneuvered through the complex channel between the northern and southern peninsulas of the island, and reached the eastern half of it by 10 August, where the troops waited. A second assault soon began. In the afternoon of the same day, Ry\u016bj\u014d and three other carrier groups began to target the bridges and roads, bridges and roads and houses, and the surrounding settlements on Tulagi Island. The Japanese were unable to take much damage as no tanks or artillery were brought into action. The carriers were able to bring only limited fire from their guns as well as their air batteries with little success. The attacking force finally failed to seize the airstrip.\nIn the morning of 14 August, the carriers began to turn south-west for their return. About 8 p.m., they reached the eastern part of Tulagi Island a few miles east of Tulagi Harbor. There they stopped, facing the airfield, in a formation which extended from the ship's masthead to port, and then returned to the ships. The carriers were accompanied by a group of transport ships, airfields, and antiaircraft defenses. A group of American Navy landing troops landed at the western part of the island and on the south-western shore of Tulagi Harbor on the right side of the harbor; the landings on the eastern and northern parts of the harbor and the western shore of the harbor were left to the transport ships. As the carriers were moving inland, Ry\u016bj\u014d began sending out fighter bombers, while the rest of the forces attacked the airfields in the north, south, and west. By 15 August, the carriers had arrived in Tokyo Bay and made port. The Japanese aircraft carrier Ch\u014dkai, arriving there at the same time, received orders not to leave, but in September 1942 it began evacuating all of its Japanese troops and supplies from Guadalcanal and Tulagi.\nThe carriers returned to Japan from San Diego, California, on 30 August and went on a tour through northern Japan. Ry\u016bj\u014d was assigned to the 5th Carrier Group from 1 November 1942 to 27 February 1943, when the group was reorganized and assigned to the 30th Fleet as of 7 March. The carriers, with Ry\u016bj\u014d carrying the group's flag, made the first of several deployments to the Western Area Command, with the group supporting the invasion of the Philippines with B-24 Liberator bombers. In January 1943, Ry\u016bj\u014d and her group attacked Saipan Island and bombarded it with shells and guns. The carrier was assigned to task force 77.4, the 5th Fleet's battle group, to which the Japanese had transferred some of the U.S. forces and materiel from the 5th Fleet. They participated in a long struggle against the Commonwealth-Allied forces on Mindoro, and then moved to the island of Guam after receiving new orders on 7 February, where the carriers were assigned to task force 77.4, and bombed the northern part of the Japanese home islands.","token_len":677,"entropy":[6.8726,9.596,5.4912,3.153,8.2087,0.0918,1.669,0.0,2.5759,7.5333,6.7215,4.9145,5.624,2.2617,3.6744,8.6215,0.4822,4.3877,3.9161,0.0006,0.9065,1.6619,5.4964,0.2933,0.7193,1.7865,8.7861,7.2908,10.3814,4.0244,4.3953,2.0449,7.0796,0.6795,11.1105,2.2333,3.2406,0.9905,7.3474,5.0977,4.4723,1.3858,2.1093,1.9478,5.4133,6.0871,4.0741,1.6516,7.4033,2.703,2.8202,1.1186,4.2585,2.6881,1.3067,5.4304,0.0079,0.5135,0.7849,1.9526,5.7547,0.0024,0.4172,1.7329,3.6283,2.1951,7.827,0.0001,4.0901,0.7367,7.1782,8.5354,3.2064,1.1614,4.4524,0.6602,0.2841,8.9891,0.034,0.4266,1.8084,0.8242,0.9793,1.0249,1.2128,5.1109,0.9038,4.5911,3.0228,0.252,4.6778,2.4966,4.5969,2.016,2.2512,4.102,2.0671,6.3995,6.8031,2.6996,4.1001,3.7328,5.2551,5.0188,2.9509,1.8916,3.3235,0.9109,3.1013,1.2495,3.0197,3.1257,0.078,0.2286,5.6715,0.0182,0.0064,0.0042,2.6986,4.1985,1.1412,2.7519,1.7984,3.2691,1.806,6.9903,0.6167,8.8322,2.2456,3.5259,4.0682,6.9698,1.1524,2.5789,3.8317,5.99,2.0616,1.1402,2.0141,4.4906,6.0394,3.7457,3.1264,0.0031,5.8698,0.4545,1.4585,1.7452,2.7721,4.0593,0.0121,4.2204,3.9937,3.1143,4.8834,7.1273,6.5511,1.2233,1.8115,1.0118,4.2213,2.2209,3.4543,0.7124,1.7536,4.7064,1.7849,3.9748,0.0251,5.5272,5.6508,4.5465,4.3928,2.0866,1.5601,2.7707,4.8956,3.314,0.3484,3.4811,4.334,4.7194,5.5356,4.5169,3.5401,0.2864,1.6391,6.1663,1.7595,5.2666,6.9303,0.213,4.5446,0.8332,7.6915,0.0509,3.2117,2.2807,7.2171,0.8305,1.8711,0.2621,3.5203,0.3015,0.5465,0.8828,4.1575,2.4795,0.9307,4.7536,2.923,2.9049,1.5126,4.7188,2.4997,5.9696,2.8807,5.3402,3.2178,3.0204,0.001,0.0021,0.4909,2.4937,2.4452,0.5783,3.9055,2.5727,0.0045,0.7967,0.0014,2.9006,7.7425,1.5555,1.0897,2.6931,0.0558,4.3054,0.0027,4.2563,0.6162,3.9901,1.4101,4.8391,2.2834,6.0629,1.3183,6.5875,0.5012,1.343,4.0978,1.749,3.9895,3.7605,5.1059,2.2297,0.6494,5.6692,0.7711,4.9206,4.0895,1.0701,7.9896,2.428,1.1465,2.8449,5.1649,0.5145,0.994,5.6221,1.3486,1.4383,3.2101,1.7896,6.3403,0.0849,2.0218,3.0222,0.0422,7.2436,1.4996,1.1127,7.0666,3.5623,0.5048,0.596,8.62,0.1249,0.0001,4.009,0.5227,3.7905,3.5251,0.0588,4.1575,4.9125,6.3922,5.4665,4.226,1.465,0.8061,5.0656,3.2569,0.0145,0.4001,0.353,2.5533,5.2005,1.3047,3.1137,0.6338,0.2978,2.7786,0.7431,0.7403,0.0011,2.4634,3.7147,1.5971,6.5018,2.5013,0.2829,0.0982,3.2345,5.2535,1.5761,5.0335,0.0385,2.6648,0.9556,3.7287,3.1651,1.8501,3.3227,0.1426,0.5585,4.3706,3.3683,1.2454,4.6034,2.2139,0.566,1.9798,1.4776,0.7939,6.933,1.1833,0.6101,6.4597,0.9115,0.6697,4.3081,0.7738,2.217,2.5675,3.2284,4.1941,0.5447,6.4187,0.0323,0.0015,0.0044,3.1806,5.5056,2.5593,6.0094,3.4052,1.9169,4.0128,0.7746,3.7895,0.0374,0.0687,4.0466,5.7604,0.9848,3.9817,1.15,3.3218,0.7391,2.4011,2.6233,3.1438,0.4541,0.1634,2.4248,0.6936,3.6516,3.9097,0.3535,0.3904,0.5871,2.5754,0.9223,4.0143,1.2383,8.0618,2.6986,1.9651,5.2722,6.572,2.244,1.7697,1.5777,5.9741,3.9868,4.639,1.0174,5.1375,2.8086,5.5915,4.5401,1.9687,2.5269,1.5741,0.0855,0.5902,5.9869,1.6677,4.4345,0.0054,4.3085,3.4233,1.8798,5.97,6.8471,5.5603,3.8192,2.4467,5.9395,0.0043,3.0758,1.7252,0.6949,4.3752,3.1298,2.314,4.7533,2.3838,6.5535,0.0005,0.0085,0.0004,1.2292,0.2634,0.0003,0.7809,1.8052,1.6815,3.029,3.5759,0.2343,2.721,3.997,4.9286,1.7755,1.8859,2.6409,0.4287,1.058,3.8797,1.1961,2.0741,4.811,2.7069,2.5189,4.1288,3.4046,4.3348,1.2887,0.9836,5.9038,0.0311,0.0011,0.0045,2.2724,4.2849,0.2732,1.3449,5.3048,0.0781,2.5424,2.1471,5.2216,4.8203,3.7113,0.6402,0.6467,5.2569,3.0096,0.0488,1.214,4.0234,1.6953,3.877,1.6239,5.02,0.4217,2.6835,3.0361,0.1979,0.4483,5.1223,0.011,6.0879,3.8969,6.3731,3.5542,2.0539,3.4671,1.2367,3.6484,3.9146,2.9884,4.5459,0.0553,0.0013,0.0043,6.6681,1.9097,5.441,1.935,7.4511,0.4774,4.306,2.8946,2.0667,3.3969,2.6194,6.2155,0.7685,1.2109,4.4302,8.1589,8.8243,1.9992,4.4991,1.0153,4.276,7.3724,0.8619,5.1298,0.4168,1.8579,2.309,5.8705,6.933,0.3378,1.8909,4.7569,1.995,1.1702,0.8977,2.7285,3.791,0.3791,0.2583,2.1362,0.0302,0.0013,0.0113,2.0915,5.4785,2.5708,4.6208,6.3725,0.2986,0.0027,2.4397,2.0976,8.3151,0.0313,3.6546,0.3826,4.5785,1.2065,5.3478,0.8627,1.5858,2.3872,2.0687,4.8404,0.1983,6.7834,2.1008,6.812,2.7963,6.0613,1.7623,2.7631,3.8661,0.0199,4.2764,1.4073,6.9256,0.4351,1.1749,3.0169,4.8355,1.3324,2.795,2.0303,4.5983,4.4514,1.0638,1.4724,6.5728,0.075,0.0246,0.0465,1.7631,3.0405,5.162,0.0011,2.6668,1.5866,3.8543,0.0133,0.4557,1.1892,4.5076,5.6713,0.0926,2.5052,5.3797,6.8827,1.4303,0.4588,9.894,4.7517,7.7684,0.1399,1.233,2.7966,8.5551,2.1568,2.0183,2.0128,3.8829,3.6204,0.9852,1.5985,4.8838,0.8501,5.0235,4.5345,4.7145,6.3604,1.1139,4.573,2.982,2.1044,3.4397,3.4328,2.3226,2.916,1.6948,2.0208,0.1459,0.7237,0.1591,2.243,0.0988,1.1953,2.3324,3.1466,8.9763,1.6704,5.4368,2.1515,0.0072,0.7166,4.484,6.2385,0.83,1.2245]}
{"prompt":"Chicago @ - @ based singer @ - @ songwriter Rickey Allen pushed allegations that `` Cater 2 U `` was inspired by a song he had composed with the same title and spelling ,","text":"Chicago @ - @ based singer @ - @ songwriter Rickey Allen pushed allegations that `` Cater 2 U `` was inspired by a song he had composed with the same title and spelling, titled `` Cater 2 U `` when it was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1976. The recording and performances of the song led to some controversy, as did a similar song ( \"\" In His Own Words `` by Patti Labelle), with which the song made comparisons.\n`` Cater 2 U, `` a pop music standard, was written and recorded by Rickey Allen in 1976 and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was an enormous hit for both Allen and the duo that recorded his songs: Patti Labelle singing the song and a trio of Chicago pop musicians named Sonny and Cher, who produced the track.\nIn May 1976, when the song reached No. 1 on the pop charts, the Chicago native filed a lawsuit against the Labelle songwriters.\nAllen claimed that the song was inspired by a song he composed in 1974, titled `` Cater 2 U (I Think You Might Like It), '' which made extensive use of Labelle's words in its lyrics. In April 1976, Labelle, then on tour in the United States, was approached by her publishing firm, RCA, because of the similarity to '' Cater 2 U. '' Labelle's team quickly began researching the song to assess the evidence.\nThe trio said the songwriter '' was the same guy, '' although in an interview with a Chicago newspaper they did not identify him as '' Sonny '' or '' Cher. '' Their legal team said that Labelle had in some ways contributed the lyrics, but that Allen's song was a proper pop song.\nLabelle, who claimed to have no recollection of '' Cater 2 U '' writing, said that she had just listened to the recording and could not have made any such connection. She also said she never knew the songwriter of the song.\nChicago's attorney said she found the similarity to '' Cater 2 U. '' '' This is a very obvious and glaring similarity, '' he said.\nAttorney Brian McCabe said, \"\" We all remember and we all love and we all sing this song. It is a standard. '' He also said, \"\" I think we have had enough discussion on this.\n\"\" What we don't want is for this thing to get dragged into the litigation process. And I think people should just try to look at it now as a musician has come forward and this is a matter he should deal with. '' The suit was eventually closed and dismissed.\nRickey Allen began his career singing country songs. He became a pop star in the early 1970s, recording hits in the United States. `` Cater 2 U '' was based mostly on Labelle and other songs written by other writers.\nSongs based on other songs like '' Cater 2 U '' are usually not considered legitimate music. In many cases, they are considered to be derivative works and not worthy of copyright protection.\nAlthough this song is most known for its association with Labelle, it is a popular song. The chorus of the song became a catchphrase, in much the same way some variations on the line `` a piece of bread could make this man cry '' are used today as a catchphrase in reference to a crying person.","token_len":677,"entropy":[8.5059,6.7609,6.6715,11.7402,12.6056,3.6583,4.6449,0.3909,6.8532,0.1694,12.9542,2.3596,6.6448,12.0725,12.1849,2.1165,11.9528,17.1605,10.3206,5.8066,6.418,2.9281,5.5863,0.0914,2.3004,3.6373,2.2324,2.7601,3.5782,3.0433,2.7764,2.187,2.3048,3.3806,6.4838,2.3423,4.907,0.3204,7.2916,0.7619,0.4342,3.2585,6.3001,2.2692,0.4962,7.8728,0.1594,1.4056,0.1843,1.7713,0.7737,4.7987,0.2561,1.9277,5.9067,4.3134,6.425,1.1385,0.8841,0.5429,5.8409,0.5249,5.0873,2.0458,1.1989,2.6839,4.0325,3.0894,6.448,1.4116,5.4993,10.2492,6.4563,7.3477,0.8589,0.1362,2.2093,1.8139,7.4377,0.0269,10.688,2.3647,3.7792,3.9612,2.771,1.968,1.7826,5.8383,6.8752,4.0153,3.3445,6.9843,3.7715,0.1059,0.0109,4.8822,2.1243,4.5349,7.7286,4.9254,7.0137,1.1427,1.0121,3.7743,2.4645,2.7702,0.614,3.3923,0.0069,0.0875,1.6864,2.0016,2.2568,7.7785,1.9638,0.017,0.5185,0.4427,0.27,0.2365,0.6027,0.0645,2.1696,1.8579,0.999,4.4081,6.1189,0.3073,2.5551,3.6504,2.9435,0.0911,1.9288,7.059,3.5961,6.599,6.3386,3.1186,5.5424,7.387,0.0012,0.3486,0.0288,7.8703,1.8155,1.0732,1.7918,3.533,5.4682,0.145,5.5359,5.8343,3.3094,4.556,6.9731,3.045,3.833,2.8696,1.6661,3.5028,0.8587,3.8644,1.6424,2.4652,4.3103,5.7707,2.4083,0.1856,4.3587,1.2211,1.5364,3.5863,0.2525,0.0014,0.6665,0.2745,0.1022,5.586,0.3504,0.2228,1.7282,3.6087,4.9559,5.9723,0.5533,0.6187,0.7769,1.1387,10.9255,2.622,5.1097,0.9609,2.1951,3.962,5.7961,3.119,0.5304,1.1334,0.6064,0.994,2.2079,0.0981,1.1107,1.1948,0.4093,4.1444,4.6995,3.6499,1.8051,4.0934,0.1349,2.3511,0.1209,0.0279,4.4748,4.0581,4.6607,2.3603,6.8902,2.0037,0.7507,3.3355,5.4956,2.5155,5.3697,7.8138,0.4934,0.0048,11.5381,0.0409,0.0861,5.1903,2.4853,3.7421,0.4434,0.4617,2.6488,4.7325,1.317,0.1226,6.0996,0.0045,3.6808,3.3122,5.3078,1.7606,1.8191,1.4927,0.8694,0.0982,0.4663,2.5827,6.2571,0.0945,6.1002,8.3339,4.2703,0.8525,5.712,2.4265,1.221,7.9786,1.3888,1.243,4.1634,2.8585,3.7861,2.7023,0.1197,0.0154,2.0638,2.2571,10.0984,0.0048,2.2761,9.3503,7.6272,2.858,4.176,0.6995,0.4479,3.1564,6.0859,1.7252,7.234,0.9878,1.7771,2.1194,6.6201,5.6611,2.8638,0.6525,7.6037,5.8411,2.2786,4.0552,3.4621,4.1969,3.1698,4.2839,5.2865,3.5394,2.8169,1.2661,0.559,3.9337,0.9399,2.0157,4.5058,3.5471,0.0333,3.6733,1.3904,1.2464,4.6244,7.4463,4.3947,1.1036,1.7155,0.0121,1.35,3.9861,5.2361,5.0598,1.1372,2.3654,1.7218,4.6397,0.0033,1.6926,5.767,5.6688,2.7751,3.8438,3.5437,1.2748,2.2394,1.1639,1.4112,5.9113,2.2367,3.5152,1.2354,3.067,8.3861,6.2104,0.5456,1.2404,1.2475,7.8066,5.5755,2.8435,1.2208,4.8658,2.1408,0.4737,2.9058,3.7833,0.0332,5.3248,0.4596,0.0093,0.0018,3.0208,4.4997,0.815,1.769,1.2074,2.3755,1.7043,5.3212,4.3598,0.0281,1.0462,3.6603,1.2429,4.4952,0.4539,5.4536,3.5618,2.0669,3.2468,2.7498,0.7383,1.7473,2.2237,0.6548,1.7099,3.8148,3.3799,1.5396,0.9943,0.4899,4.4743,0.6742,0.4786,1.7397,0.7091,8.1562,2.059,4.0475,3.9779,2.9391,5.1489,1.0001,4.6067,1.7804,0.7463,0.3312,0.0141,0.0024,0.8104,0.557,4.6921,12.9159,2.9041,2.1306,3.4955,5.6819,4.0206,5.286,3.1227,1.8142,6.3357,2.6976,0.2252,0.2806,0.9326,7.5417,5.0496,8.6324,1.2958,3.0623,5.1576,4.0387,4.8227,4.0427,5.8281,2.6443,0.7962,3.8298,3.0254,1.1852,0.3413,6.2663,3.5428,0.2362,1.2737,1.7211,1.869,1.5233,5.8832,4.549,4.7259,2.0371,3.2493,0.545,2.5821,2.4519,3.4988,2.3014,2.453,3.5875,4.9026,3.1366,7.2423,2.9803,0.8088,1.6453,4.1163,7.4139,5.577,1.7665,3.4823,0.0033,2.8503,1.8061,1.8655,2.8252,6.196,0.046,2.091,5.3917,1.7868,1.1532,4.3425,3.7169,1.0103,4.0717,2.2596,0.7979,5.301,2.0775,4.0671,4.708,0.4076,4.2574,0.4547,1.7447,5.6871,3.2729,1.4315,7.5436,6.4196,5.1314,2.2691,1.1243,5.2075,1.3376,1.2755,4.0145,4.9268,2.3277,6.0167,0.0105,1.5272,3.1373,4.0379,3.8692,1.4915,2.8429,5.7455,3.0977,6.7589,1.0977,0.5518,5.0344,3.1662,0.0907,6.0313,1.3307,0.5329,5.009,7.5286,2.1651,3.4532,0.8392,3.8669,0.9934,4.1061,1.2419,0.8687,1.0744,1.5632,1.8311,0.112,1.2955,4.1162,4.2457,3.7434,1.5586,3.9857,0.0428,3.5249,6.7943,4.1903,0.0459,0.0065,3.2114,0.9442,5.0079,7.1363,0.1273,7.2693,0.0089,4.2823,3.3639,2.9729,3.1724,0.5749,3.5699,6.2152,1.165,2.1951,6.3565,2.641,4.298,0.0998,3.6737,1.6719,5.1427,0.7563,2.6394,0.0323,0.0106,3.2004,3.2266,3.2296,3.34,2.3641,6.348,3.2006,1.1668,2.94,4.5905,0.5534,0.2298,2.6615,0.6977,3.0226,2.3759,0.2338,3.2299,0.6535,3.0546,3.1733,4.6182,0.1205,2.2551,1.0576,0.2122,1.3038,4.8598,4.7437,3.4133,1.7329,6.2051,4.5515,0.5699,0.8905,6.4776,0.0284,7.1822,0.0109,0.4311,1.4905,1.253,3.3326,2.1347,1.0406,3.4348,2.0068,5.4547,1.15,0.7196,0.2825,7.6628,1.7425,6.7908,0.1999,3.3642,4.3713,6.754,0.2049,0.0834,0.0675,6.272,8.1519,1.4835,0.9243,3.9704,3.9331,6.2238,5.8452,0.0921,4.6406,5.6384,3.1629,5.6789,4.3825,4.9062,1.256,1.7352,2.0614,2.7871,4.2154,1.3748,0.8431,0.0896,1.1993,4.6432,0.0043,2.1505,8.7006,4.1534,0.3537]}
{"prompt":"The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) recorded eight aftershocks in the two hours after the main earthquake , with magnitudes between 4 @ . @ 3 and 5 @ . @ 9 .","text":"The United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) recorded eight aftershocks in the two hours after the main earthquake, with magnitudes between 4 @. @ 3 and 5 @. @ 9. Four were reported to be felt and three of them were at or near the epicenter within a radius of only 60 km.\nThe earthquake occurred about a mile beneath the coast, and according to USGS seismic observers, several fault ruptures have been found along the San Andreas between the epicenter and Los Angeles.\nWithin a mile of the epicenter, the San Andreas and the San Jacinto fault ruptured and the San Jacinto fault ruptured at a depth of about a half mile, along a surface that runs east-west parallel to the coast between Ventura and Los Angeles.\nThe depth of the San Andreas ruptures on land was less than half of that of the San Jacinto fault.\nAt present, the possibility of a large earthquake along the San Andreas has not been established.\nThe main shock, which was described by the USGS as a M 5.0 moment magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, was caused by a strike motion on the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake occurred as the southwestward-moving oceanic plate and the mainland plate collided.\nThe two plates pulled at the rate of 5 miles per year and came together about 1 to 1.7 miles beneath the central parts of Ventura and Los Angeles.\nThe earthquake was felt about 100 miles inland from the coast, but it had no immediate consequence for the public, the government or the oil industry in California.\nThe main shock hit only slightly inland of Ventura, where the Pacific Plate and the southwestward-moving plate collide.\nAbout 1 mile southwest of the epicenter on Highway 101 in Ventura, the structure of the surface collapsed several feet as a result of the earthquake.\nAt Highway 49, about 15 miles south of the epicenter, the hills and landslides caused a highway to be temporarily closed for about three hours.\nThe USGS reported that no damage was done in the homes of the people within 40 miles of the epicenter, but as the earth continued to shake, a few minor structural damage was reported from outside the zone of the earthquake.\nThe USGS also said that no damage was done to oil facilities near Ventura.\nDamage also occurred in the cities of Santa Barbara and Santa Maria, south of the epicenter, and damage was reported to buildings in San Diego and La Jolla, between San Diego and San Francisco.\nThe U.S. Forest Service said that an earthquake in Santa Maria and the surrounding area was felt by an individual from Los Angeles, about 65 miles northeast of the epicenter of the earthquake.\nThe quake was not felt by any individuals within Los Angeles, but an individual south of Los Angeles reported that she felt the earthquake.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that there had been no damage to buildings or structures by the earthquake in the Santa Barbara area.\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District said that it had

{"prompt":"Fincher stated that every main cast member was their first choice . In the first read through , he said `` I want everybody here to know that you represent our first choice \u2014 each","text":"Fincher stated that every main cast member was their first choice. In the first read through, he said `` I want everybody here to know that you represent our first choice \u2014 each and every one of you. '', This was in line with the premise, which stated that every main cast member was the first choice.\nAired on April 25, this special concluded with the announcement that a second season had been ordered. Fincher, who was in charge of writing the second episode, said that it would be a \"continuation of [ the ] series and not a reboot \", although he did hint that they had to go through changes and try to have less of a dramatic tone, but the episodes would still be intense.\nThe second season is currently in production and will have a new head writer, Ben Feldman, who helped to write the second episode ( No, It Won't Get Better ), and Fincher himself, who will be directing the episodes. On April 30, it was announced by Netflix that the second season would be an eight-episode season and it showed images from an episode and cast photos.\nThis season premiered on December 4, and will have a similar style to the first season, which is a story that will take place in the same universe, or universe 2. Episode 1, the first episode was a prologue, which will focus on the main cast being the only ones to be alive after the events of Season 1, and the reasons why everyone left the Earth.\nAs the first season was a dramatic one, with many episodes that gave the impression that the main characters had no hope or belief about life, especially after the destruction on Day 51. The second season will have a story where the main cast has had many failures in many different things in their lives, including having lost hope in many things, but each character will also learn in life that there's always something else.\nWe would like to thank those who came to the 10th Global Hepatitis Forum in Singapore and presented their research. The presentations have been translated into English and made public in this online event.\nTo facilitate the online event's schedule and make the content easier to understand, you can split the slides into three different sections: Part I: Clinical, Part II: Experimental, Part III: Research and Data Analysis.\nWe have also translated parts of the presentation PowerPoint into English, giving you access to all original information.\nPlease contact the organizors, if you are interested in the materials in Chinese, Russian or other languages.\nThe conference held in Singapore has been a unique and successful platform, allowing researchers to present a large amount of original content and to discuss future scientific directions. The conference was well attended with over 100 speakers, including those from the pharmaceutical industry and academic institutions.\nWe at the Centre for Immunology and Infectious Diseases are delighted with the quality and diversity of the presentations. We wish to thank all the speakers, who participated in the conference by presenting their research and are also thankful to the organizers for their excellent collaboration.\nLisa Dove, Ph.D., Chief

{"prompt":"On 27 January 2011 , Torres was the subject of a \u00a3 40 million bid from Chelsea , which was rejected by Liverpool . He subsequently handed in an official transfer request to Liverpool the","text":"On 27 January 2011, Torres was the subject of a \u00a3 40 million bid from Chelsea, which was rejected by Liverpool. He subsequently handed in an official transfer request to Liverpool the day after. He was subsequently sold to Porto for \u00a3 30 million on 26 June 2011.\nTorres was heavily criticised by Liverpool supporters and football fans for his defensive attitude at centre-back against West Ham United on 5 September 2011 in the 2011 FA Community Shield match. It was made very clear by fans and journalists (including the Daily Star ) that they expected Torres to play more attacking football to regain the trust and respect of the supporters.\nOn the other side, he won the Golden Boot to go with his second league title, becoming the only player to be awarded both. He won his third league title in 2012\u201313, helping the team to top the league.\nOn 2 December 2012, after a disappointing season, Torres left Liverpool for Valencia for the cost of \u20ac25 Million. On 30 December 2012, Torres won the Golden Boot award for his excellent contributions to his club's winning run.\nOn 31 January 2014, he came on as a late substitute for Jamie Carragher and scored the game-winning goal against Arsenal; it was the first of Torres' goals in the Premier League this season. After scoring 14 goals in 2013\u201314, Torres was named as the Man of the match with Chelsea's victory over Crystal Palace on 11 April 2014. A few days later, he was nominated for The FA's The Best award.\nOn 29 July 2014, he returned to Liverpool, signing a three-year deal that saw him return to the Anfield for a reported fee of \u20ac21 million. Although he was heavily criticised by supporters in some quarters over the summer transfer window, he won plaudits for the way in which he handled himself, for the amount of ball possession for the team as a whole and for his defensive qualities.\n\nReturn to Liverpool (2014\u20132016)\n\nOn January 2016, Torres and Liverpool agreed to a four-year contract, keeping him at the club until 2018. On 26 July 2016, he returned to Valencia on a permanent basis on a four-and-a-half-year contract after ending his Liverpool contract.\n\nReturn to Liverpool (2018\u2013present)\n\nOn 31 July 2018, he rejoined Liverpool, signing an 18 month contract.\nTorres won a penalty against Stoke City on 3 December 2018.\n\nInternational career\n\nOn 17 July 2008, Torres played at Liverpool's first training session since the outbreak of the 2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League final as his selection was ruled unquestionable despite not having trained a full week. Although ineligible due to having two yellow cards, he participated in the training, and his exclusion from the list after the match against Chelsea caused controversy from some supporters and the media.\nOn 12 November 2008, his presence on the Liverpool starting line-up for the EFL Cup semi-final at home to Sunderland was confirmed and became a source of controversy after a reported decision

{"prompt":"Five years later , Buffalo was presented with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands . Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart , who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry","text":"Five years later, Buffalo was presented with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands. Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart, who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry, took up residence at Pointe La Pointe. He planned a settlement of 1,500 people for the area and invited the Boneyasek to move there. The family of four soon relocated to the settlement where he was employed as a trapper. After the outbreak of the Civil War the Boneyasek were evacuated to a house in Pointe La Pointe and then to another house in Lacolle. As the war progressed the Boneyasek again moved to Pointe La Pointe.\nIn 1872, Bonyasek received a pension from the government for his service as a spy. The Boneyasek operated a general store in Lacolle and spent his spare time hunting and fishing. In 1872 Bonyasek purchased a horse to aid him in hunting. In 1876 he moved to St. James, Ontario along with his widowed mother, his two sisters and one brother. He purchased 2,000 acres in St. James Township to farm.\nIn 1880 the Bonyasek purchased a 10 acre parcel of lumber land from the Canadian Pacific Railway (C.P.R.) and erected a log building on the land. In 1894, the Bonyas'eski and another member of the Boneyasek family, Peter W. Tindall, were involved in a major fire at the old log cabin. The Boneyas'ek were involved in at least eight major fires the following year.. The St. James Post Office began recording the Boneyasek family on June 28, 1909.\nIn 1902, Bonyasek sold the log cabin property and moved to Pelly Township (now part of Burlington County). He owned some 700 acres which he leased to five different individuals. He was a successful entrepreneur who ran his own general store and served as a warden at the Burlington County Correctional Centre, a school teacher and clerk to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart.\nDuring World War I, Boneyasek was a member of the local Salvage Command and served in the United States Navy. In 1935 he sold 100 acres to an entrepreneur named Charles Brown (Chet Brown). Bonyasek continued to manage his lumbering operations in Ontario. At 86 years of age, Bonyasek suffered an injury from falling off a horse in 1936. Afterward, his health deteriorated and he became depressed.\n\nMurals and historical marker\n\nIn May 2016 the Bonyasek family donated two murals to the University of Guelph's College of Arts. One is painted on the top wall of the family's log cabin and the other was painted in St. James Township. The families also donated the Boneyasek family log cabin, one of the original logs from the first log cabin built by the family in 1872. The log cabin was sold to a Canadian Pacific Railway employee to help fund the building of the current log cabin. The two murals celebrate the Boneyasek's contributions to the history of Burlington County. Part of it includes the names and other information about the Boneyasek family.

The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401 , whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401 . It","text":"Highway 403 begins at a junction with Highway 401 on the outskirts of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401. It heads north through the small town of North Conway, before turning east toward the village of Linn and the town of Greenbrook. At the intersection with Highway 28, Highway 403 meets U.S. Route 63 south of Conway, which connects to Interstate 5E west of Greenbrook. The route continues east through the small towns of Pawley, West Peake, West Linn and Greenfield, before reaching the border of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The highway continues east through Woburn and the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Farther east, it becomes a part of Interstate 94. After crossing into New York County, the highway leaves the freeway system and becomes primarily a local road for some time, passing over the West Shore Line Railway line and meeting Interstate 95. Highway 403 crosses the Hudson River near the border of Westchester County and Orange County. It curves northeast as it meets Interstate 880. East of Fort Lee, the highway is joined by Highway 405; the junction is located just north of the Westchester County line. In Westchester County, Highway 403 passes near the community of Manville and continues to the northern suburbs of New York City. After crossing the Hudson River into Orange County, Highway 403 passes the communities of Teaneck, Woodside, and North Shore. Farther east, it merges into another local highway, Route 78. Near Long Island City, Highway 403 crosses the Long Island Rail Road. Near the intersection with the Lincoln Tunnel, it leaves a freeway and becomes local to the west. On the far eastern side of Long Island, Highway 403 meets the Long Island Expressway. Near Flushing, the route crosses into Queens County along the south bank of the East River. Near the eastern end of the expressway, it leaves the expressway to serve as South Queens Park Avenue in Queens County as a major local city street. Farther west, the route becomes the eastern terminus of Queens Boulevard. Farther west, the route meets another local city, Long Island Avenue, which heads east to connect with Highway 5. \nHistory\n\nThe original route of Highway 403 did not even cross the Hudson River, instead following the western bank, and was extended to the New York state line in 1965. The first section east of the river (from Exit 40 - Fort Lee to Exit 65 - Far Rockaway) was opened in 1967. The stretch to the expressway (from Exit 66 - South Queens Park Avenue to the expressway) was not completed until 1978, and by then the entire route from the river to the expressway had been converted to highway. The route was extended north to the Lincoln Tunnel and the Bronx River State Park at the expressway in 1973.\nAt one time, there was controversy over using a bypass for the construction of the expressway. The government agreed to fund a bridge over the Lincoln Tunnel for a fee that was paid by the builders of the expressway. This arrangement was described by an official involved in the development of the tunnel at the time, as the government agreeing to a fee for a route that would soon be included in the expressway, the road itself and the tunnel.","token_len":680,"entropy":[7.8061,10.1162,7.5527,1.5414,3.5725,3.7561,0.9735,2.6567,2.4891,3.9166,0.9392,6.163,0.0274,5.9325,1.6795,0.7518,1.6132,5.3286,0.1445,1.3451,6.5767,3.9288,5.5856,0.1299,1.5346,0.3364,2.897,8.7498,0.2539,0.3336,0.0151,0.2079,4.8341,1.3161,4.352,0.0012,0.4864,0.2169,0.4686,4.8653,7.7307,1.7278,3.2704,1.3539,6.1637,0.6454,0.0711,5.1185,6.1739,1.144,4.425,1.834,2.4249,4.0276,1.5987,4.9681,0.0438,5.367,3.4701,4.231,3.3937,2.3767,0.0864,5.0169,6.7717,0.3184,3.7841,1.0806,1.0849,2.0267,1.2046,9.2975,0.5737,2.8263,4.1276,4.6269,7.3912,0.3153,0.0169,0.0099,2.6209,5.7498,4.7674,0.3574,6.1586,1.6259,3.2579,3.8185,1.8542,3.7096,2.1056,6.2125,5.8356,0.2257,3.2131,0.1093,0.291,1.7219,4.3333,4.1847,2.1912,1.5415,1.1468,1.5839,5.0683,0.0311,10.0424,4.1114,0.8068,4.6987,7.8683,4.128,0.5085,4.6225,4.8752,0.0474,1.4543,3.7305,3.9731,1.4827,1.4053,4.3426,1.2805,5.267,1.0667,8.0152,0.4593,3.4305,0.0029,0.2485,1.7314,3.0989,3.6413,2.2669,0.9876,6.3535,3.9115,0.046,1.1866,2.726,5.9946,2.9339,1.1356,2.3598,0.2698,3.394,1.1299,7.6717,1.7261,0.0096,2.2737,0.4168,2.8219,4.8085,1.4057,5.1519,0.0268,3.0037,4.6147,2.134,4.818,1.7836,4.5799,2.1231,0.398,5.6307,0.2743,1.046,0.9026,5.9992,1.3282,9.4843,5.0898,1.1916,4.2921,9.4936,0.4295,5.9142,2.1797,3.9638,5.4673,1.481,2.0052,4.0145,3.6151,1.9501,5.8482,4.2347,7.2833,8.1042,5.08,1.9924,8.0823,2.0701,2.8576,0.8832,5.0706,1.8604,2.8589,1.0275,4.3139,0.0715,4.1599,1.721,4.7511,0.2199,4.5847,0.6482,0.5759,0.458,6.6819,0.1232,0.7343,1.7358,6.6425,4.6251,5.1544,0.5242,4.7935,1.63,3.8016,3.9431,1.4545,7.2934,1.3505,7.9733,3.1718,0.4994,1.259,0.516,3.0287,3.1449,0.4923,2.2852,4.8012,6.3215,1.8883,4.9851,1.8748,4.2528,2.8948,1.3775,0.0038,1.3857,5.0827,2.6831,0.4115,1.1722,0.4883,3.7251,5.2527,0.2339,0.1028,0.0933,2.6464,1.4505,2.737,5.2852,0.9184,8.2487,0.0546,7.0641,5.0921,2.1981,5.2337,1.8105,1.4012,5.0059,4.6462,0.216,3.2519,0.6072,0.4666,0.3134,4.3352,1.1113,1.1701,2.4214,0.2426,3.0602,4.2601,0.0202,0.0997,2.1143,0.5603,1.5967,4.1332,6.9614,0.0287,8.0755,0.4896,0.006,0.839,4.3245,4.6,0.4801,2.29,4.3671,5.1039,0.6274,4.4437,0.0057,0.0033,1.445,0.0649,0.9556,8.5968,0.0001,1.6121,5.7008,1.927,2.3549,1.1668,3.0322,5.3077,0.688,6.496,5.4201,0.4869,1.1029,0.1271,1.927,0.6924,1.9755,0.67,3.54,0.0317,3.4749,0.0076,2.532,5.632,1.4371,2.1709,0.7898,1.6135,6.6094,0.2039,0.2386,1.0737,5.3098,4.2151,5.4607,4.2532,2.2192,6.896,3.7325,1.2213,4.9589,0.8874,4.4109,0.5637,4.789,4.7722,0.9778,0.0908,1.2527,0.001,1.1084,1.5126,0.4962,2.0918,1.355,3.6555,0.0436,3.7397,0.2738,0.9889,4.1274,9.1752,0.2345,0.7425,1.1135,4.8882,2.3798,3.3111,5.0422,1.0178,5.7677,1.0826,5.3711,2.4584,0.0325,0.1793,5.455,0.0577,0.4729,4.2095,1.1592,6.9103,1.7957,0.0521,1.122,5.1474,0.0293,0.1907,0.9814,4.2181,1.1889,3.7897,0.0389,2.7653,6.1822,2.6973,8.076,2.7452,4.1606,5.837,4.1159,1.2178,1.0879,5.4815,2.3576,4.7844,5.6167,5.898,6.7604,0.3471,2.2206,0.0055,0.004,1.7806,0.0957,1.2258,2.7675,3.1752,2.6497,4.505,1.5846,0.0005,0.0501,4.8664,3.7413,0.9626,2.2383,0.0088,0.0061,2.8606,0.1722,0.9092,1.9233,3.6451,5.5611,1.266,5.8473,3.1949,4.8397,0.0996,5.1571,1.2162,1.6144,4.7421,2.031,1.9834,4.0798,1.144,3.6195,4.5594,1.5141,9.3243,7.3577,9.7807,2.4078,2.9125,1.6049,3.7788,3.259,1.4046,2.0101,0.711,6.6926,0.0537,5.6772,2.5205,0.8766,1.18,0.6259,2.3062,4.7527,4.865,1.1482,5.4684,4.0472,5.2801,3.1204,3.4976,5.5053,1.8051,1.2582,3.8433,0.2318,4.5422,0.5501,3.0697,6.6587,0.4565,1.4391,3.2427,3.2495,8.0522,0.2597,0.9836,2.2483,4.0274,3.9238,7.3358,4.7032,7.6184,6.8962,0.2378,2.1325,3.6954,5.2669,1.4838,7.1216,2.3254,0.401,0.1816,0.7673,3.4555,0.5789,3.2549,1.2287,1.2199,6.0444,4.5644,0.703,8.6227,0.0442,2.7197,1.0085,2.1396,4.3242,0.9686,4.5841,1.0777,0.8053,0.5001,1.2054,1.9078,3.9669,0.0078,1.1366,0.8522,4.5183,1.7965,0.0765,3.1438,1.2307,1.7678,4.7392,1.2565,1.2343,3.2566,2.6039,5.5961,1.7251,3.4181,0.3764,0.766,0.9224,0.0073,0.6893,0.6574,4.9976,0.8352,4.0736,1.1827,1.4247,3.0661,1.6891,3.1274,3.9369,1.7919,1.2318,6.3641,0.0466,2.0449,2.9063,5.9853,1.9806,7.1321,0.3793,4.661,1.2838,7.3494,0.0231,3.8383,4.4273,0.4895,2.0523,17.0756,3.9476,1.7411,0.4411,3.5001,0.8767,8.0662,0.64,6.2341,2.6744,5.4536,2.99,1.0418,7.0476,0.0285,0.6567,1.4493,0.0371,0.7882,1.7048,5.4982,4.2034,0.3296,4.5766,2.0553,3.367,1.5556,0.2906,3.7518,0.0776,3.6107,2.335,4.7249,3.0296,1.593,3.5365,1.0575,0.8667,6.3269,1.3367,0.2348,1.5849,0.0655,0.6183,3.0846,5.6865,1.1532,6.4872,1.618,4.6118,3.0289,6.0565,0.2349,0.3871,3.4201,0.4223,0.1577,3.1733,4.1365,0.5061,0.212,2.2835,1.5009,3.462,6.2845,10.5995,0.1689,2.9515,1.8467,1.6773,2.1371,4.9713,1.1441,0.7527,8.4548,1.0991,5.6363,0.2916,0.4215,3.2886,0.0231,2.9701,4.5038,5.4158,4.2682,3.2654,0.7263,2.8141,1.4575]}

{"prompt":"At the end of 2005 , Nesbitt and his agent met with BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter to discuss a new series of Murphy 's Law . At the meeting 's conclusion , Tranter","text":"At the end of 2005, Nesbitt and his agent met with BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter to discuss a new series of Murphy's Law. At the meeting's conclusion, Tranter reported that a new series was still in development, but that an official announcement would only be made one year from the time the first episode was broadcast. Subsequent to this, the show was announced for release on BBC America on February 17, 2006. Subsequent to a July 27th 2006 broadcast of Murphy's Law's fourth episode, \" The Day After Tomorrow \", an official announcement indicated that the following week would be the official launch date for BBC 1's new series. On September 27, 2006, the BBC announced that the first series of Murphy's Law would air on BBC One on Sunday, September 29, 2006.  Murphy's Law, based loosely on the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, has been described as a modern day version of the comic novels. It is set in a London office building and follows a number of employees across four stories. The main cast consists of the title character, Murphy's Law, ( played by Hugh Laurie ), a law practitioner with a tendency to make careless mistakes. Murphy is accompanied by his assistant, Mr. Magoo, an American working on the BBC, the young secretary, Emily, and an array of other characters. Murphy himself, however, is not shown on the screen directly. Rather, it is his assistant, Mr. Magoo ( played by Sean Harris ), who is always seen in his presence, making excuses to keep doing things from his point of view. A special mention is given to Bill Mulder's character. He works in the office and he is responsible for the building's power supply that is used to keep the building's computers and lighting energized. Murphy's Law is written by Bill Hader and Paul Feig. It is produced by the BBC, HBO, and The Jim Cramer Show in association with the Wicked Productions. The show is directed by Bill Murray and Danny McBride. There is one episode that is not written or directed by Bill Murray and Danny McBride. That episode is written by Paul Weiland and directed by John Waters, featuring a fictional story of the infamous John Waters. Murphy's law won four Primetime Emmy awards in 2007.\nMurphy's Law\n\nReception\n\nA review from Entertainment Weekly noted that Murphy's Law is an exciting work of television, but found that some of the episodes had been \" tweaked into unintentionally comic, absurd, and far-fetched scenarios. \" Other criticisms of Murphy's Law included criticisms that the series lacked the style of modern political sitcoms. The reviewer from The Guardian stated that Bill Mulder's character needed to be \" better, not more.\"\nStephen Frears, a critic from The Times, wrote an article on his experiences with Murphy's Law that said it was \" a little strange, and not so well done \". Frears stated that a BBC comedy, \" has a duty to itself, to its audience, to produce something original, to say something new.\" Frears also commented that the series needed to show that \" it had a point of view, that it stood up for itself, that it was not a bunch of characters talking nonsense about nothing, \" and that \" that point of view needed to be developed.\"","token_len":680,"entropy":[2.5476,2.317,0.089,6.7071,0.281,6.427,4.7579,1.2851,0.0347,3.5936,1.689,6.5663,4.4111,0.3882,9.8248,11.1392,3.0773,10.0916,7.9741,6.1809,2.178,2.5322,2.2106,0.836,2.202,2.5265,2.2452,1.1984,9.5014,0.795,1.8635,3.2831,4.4561,0.5896,3.4476,7.0068,0.6357,0.135,2.0723,0.0001,0.0004,5.7258,0.5845,3.5638,2.1035,0.7963,1.8697,5.6774,1.0846,1.1526,1.1771,1.6958,1.0853,5.0904,3.9699,0.9999,1.8452,5.9326,0.3181,0.3708,4.7193,2.0874,3.2049,3.8071,2.7632,1.4478,2.5064,2.2334,1.4022,2.2863,0.3111,6.774,0.8452,2.8559,1.396,0.751,1.9363,2.5088,1.1041,5.2392,2.871,3.0353,1.4587,2.3761,2.4805,2.5594,2.8732,3.4106,0.1985,0.2742,0.4571,5.3934,0.4146,0.9482,5.8979,5.7291,3.9043,2.7878,5.055,2.7192,1.5135,2.236,0.0084,0.0155,5.654,3.3801,1.6363,0.3603,4.8615,6.2344,5.0702,2.0491,3.6349,0.4093,4.1787,1.7257,0.525,7.7344,0.1633,1.0175,5.6574,2.9552,2.8058,0.3935,0.93,3.0312,3.6025,0.6767,0.4913,6.8569,8.0572,0.7634,1.5637,0.9235,1.359,3.1674,2.2205,3.6793,3.157,0.5028,0.1161,1.4241,2.1691,0.5253,0.6308,1.6432,1.7939,3.4749,0.9372,0.6255,0.001,0.0052,0.5135,2.0131,0.5735,0.9376,1.6066,2.0744,5.1127,1.5868,0.7724,2.3017,0.9891,0.3066,0.4487,8.4016,11.9117,0.035,0.0288,3.7361,4.3743,5.9396,0.158,0.686,4.3678,0.045,3.5508,8.6853,0.077,4.5854,0.2881,0.0008,0.3631,3.5334,1.0648,3.0969,0.4425,1.0442,5.4793,2.6811,1.9856,0.0074,1.1654,6.0727,6.4669,3.3962,2.0963,1.4873,3.0224,0.5597,1.5421,4.9504,4.8283,1.2304,2.2105,1.9231,1.0358,5.2436,0.0015,6.0952,6.4431,4.4784,5.6127,1.5485,1.4265,3.4927,3.5918,1.5401,0.0166,3.0597,5.5436,0.1424,0.9045,5.0118,2.7875,0.4943,1.8998,5.7216,9.531,0.0224,6.0877,1.7578,1.47,1.6519,4.8979,6.9417,3.2936,0.8485,6.0085,0.5409,3.8823,6.969,1.2793,1.5505,3.0973,3.5808,5.9322,0.0619,1.0694,2.5656,0.9211,4.2011,0.7538,6.9915,4.3025,0.5968,3.6029,4.2675,7.3197,3.2566,1.7182,5.4544,2.7775,4.5366,6.7188,6.3285,1.1006,5.7563,1.9088,1.2398,3.5424,7.958,0.0006,1.0921,1.6866,0.5954,2.9037,3.6618,2.9364,3.4876,0.0085,0.7199,1.7967,3.845,3.7053,2.2963,2.8467,7.7797,1.0963,3.6011,0.122,3.7764,0.2132,3.9298,1.3128,1.0569,1.6809,0.0072,1.6887,0.0009,3.1114,2.6205,0.0114,4.9459,6.1878,0.4767,0.2188,1.147,5.4994,3.9068,1.8527,3.1556,5.999,1.6468,4.3944,8.2503,2.5681,3.4786,5.9295,2.4738,5.7444,2.1072,4.9041,0.0196,0.002,0.2542,4.1576,4.7873,5.3447,0.4886,1.7938,0.0385,7.5451,7.2249,1.7044,2.8097,1.1617,4.2859,4.2843,6.4633,2.3316,1.2567,1.9464,2.9804,4.8412,1.325,5.0382,0.0186,1.9118,4.8847,0.914,7.1859,2.3422,5.5246,2.2797,1.7057,0.5564,3.6218,0.7392,1.4043,2.4565,4.3381,3.13,5.0056,7.5908,0.1312,0.3274,2.7351,1.506,0.0765,1.0613,3.1544,0.3858,4.6983,4.6294,4.0465,1.7154,7.5866,6.2321,0.0963,1.1175,2.3266,1.1164,3.0293,0.1413,3.1875,1.0463,2.4215,7.037,0.5639,1.9431,3.8346,8.5439,4.2172,1.2939,0.5982,5.2705,0.1485,0.0011,2.946,11.0687,2.478,1.4572,1.8596,1.9658,1.4202,2.4529,0.0455,4.2949,3.4021,1.1279,9.6489,2.5745,0.0877,0.7187,5.326,0.8429,3.9933,2.5164,3.3499,1.319,1.5426,4.4624,3.3359,0.6749,0.0657,1.2113,0.0538,2.1906,4.2093,0.0229,0.0015,0.5673,6.0492,0.3353,0.9355,4.4084,0.144,4.0579,6.1784,5.4148,1.2213,1.521,0.0094,3.5345,5.9748,2.4848,5.6357,2.1364,5.3908,4.4556,1.9098,1.9786,6.1788,5.437,4.6067,3.0326,3.7158,0.2671,4.9456,7.0743,4.8334,5.5978,0.071,0.0279,2.706,1.4918,2.7144,1.7067,2.7079,7.7082,0.0005,0.1121,0.0431,5.2486,6.1288,7.7123,0.5254,0.9426,0.0003,4.2353,3.5998,3.6915,4.4411,0.0322,3.6976,0.4737,1.5196,0.0642,0.0244,2.2413,3.4848,5.475,4.7451,2.2829,3.0074,1.87,2.7875,7.4239,1.4529,4.5423,2.0912,0.7092,3.4114,3.8773,3.0103,2.0199,15.7096,4.7453,9.5678,6.241,3.9925,5.0805,0.9757,1.3149,6.2677,1.2231,0.3342,3.5769,3.0011,2.5001,6.3011,5.9988,1.8826,1.1187,0.0018,0.0217,1.8426,7.1571,1.6609,1.4357,2.2823,2.4442,2.0106,5.4465,0.7903,4.937,5.2995,5.7713,0.0801,1.3239,2.2061,5.9498,7.3503,2.6695,3.1285,3.6245,0.3663,8.6174,3.5766,0.01,0.8172,0.7786,6.7234,0.7627,0.9806,1.6234,7.326,3.8204,3.6362,2.6677,2.5892,2.0536,19.0434,5.4065,0.0226,1.6849,2.4655,2.4111,3.155,1.5688,4.1038,1.2837,2.3704,4.3209,0.7648,2.764,4.5162,6.5,0.7376,0.7909,0.0168,0.0088,2.244,3.3733,2.9308,0.6695,0.775,2.8304,3.5877,4.4367,3.4256,2.9326,2.759,3.7931,4.0714,2.1765,4.7527,3.49,0.0042,3.7158,0.1702,4.5589,6.4563,6.0087,3.3814,2.1445,4.841,1.9468,8.1084,0.2149,5.4544,1.7463,1.6553,2.4127,0.7418,0.4486,0.5754,5.3169,2.7799,4.7891,1.1813,3.2776,5.4053,0.8035,2.937,3.0712,2.4753,0.0041,1.6685,3.2138,0.3344,1.6266,1.6668,4.491,0.5277,4.473,2.2652,2.0476,2.8765,3.4938,1.9043,5.1447,1.7359,0.0476,1.5042,1.8561,0.5387,6.5406,2.274,1.9058,1.2212,0.8208,1.0495,0.1784,1.4981,3.0349,2.1857,5.2698,0.0143,6.2346,4.7019,4.5116,2.227,5.1647,1.6933,5.9499,1.0391,0.6695,1.6931,3.9807,3.1513,0.1594,0.0016,3.8423,0.2242,0.3772,6.315,4.6551]}
{"prompt":"On 23 December 1972 at 16 : 30 , the company 's most fatal accident occurred . F @ - @ 28 LN @ - @ < unk > Sverre < unk > on Flight","text":"On 23 December 1972 at 16 : 30, the company's most fatal accident occurred. F @ - @ 28 LN @ - @ < unk > Sverre < unk > on Flight 2578 from Reykjav\u00edk to New York and back was to make the last leg down to New York City. At 16 : 30 the plane had just left Reykjav\u00edk airport and the airspeed was around 600 knots, which is about 900 miles an hour. After a short flight the airspeed suddenly dropped from about 600 knots to about 300 knots. Before the plane had time to turn hard enough to avoid a storm, it hit trees outside of Reykjav\u00edk airport. At the same time a gust of wind struck the rear part of the plane. As result the bulkhead separating the cockpit from the main cabin broke open.\nThe front part of the cockpit was badly damaged and the entire area, including the seat belts and instrument panels, was a mass of filigree and metal fragments. The three pilots survived the crash and immediately attempted to pull the badly broken cockpit forward. The pilot behind the co-pilot held the plane right up into the tree and the two other pilots tried to pull him down to the cockpit. As result both arms and shoulder injuries were sustained.\nThe damage was severe enough that the front part of the cockpit was no use. Thus, the aircraft had to circle the airport for an hour looking for another landing facility, so that the crew could take off again. This accident cost the company one pilot, one civilian employee and thirteen passengers dead.\nFor the following ten years the cargo airplane fleet slowly disappeared. Before 1960 the company had operated thirteen cargo planes in the US, which included Boeing 737s and DC-1s, and one Boeing 727 in Iceland. After 1960 most of the cargo planes were sold to airlines in North America, some were leased and some went up for replacement in Iceland.\nIn 1978 J\u00f3n Stef\u00e1nsson became the chief executive officer of the Viking. He had trained for the company as a pilot and became chief executive due to the loss of Icelandic national airline, Reykjav\u00edk, due to a failed attempt for an operation in a narrow strip on the edge of a mountain range. As a result, the new Icelandic national airline, \u00cd\u00f0stj\u00f3rnair, could not meet customer requirements due to operational and technical inadequacies.\nIt was J\u00f3n Stef\u00e1nsson's job to reorganize \u00cd\u00f0stj\u00f3rnair into a modern airline, which would be technologically and financially stable.

By this time the air groups had been reorganized to consist of 21","text":"The sister ships then rejoined the Kido Butai at Staring Bay on Celebes Island in preparation for the Indian Ocean raid. By this time the air groups had been reorganized to consist of 21 of the new Shokugawa K\u014dk\u014d and three of the Akiyama K\u014dk\u014d. Both groups were attached to the 8th Fleet and manned by the new squadron commanders, Yamamuro and Kameda. The Kido Butai also had 24 of the new S\u014dk\u014d K\u014dk\u014d, which was the oldest surviving Imperial Japanese Navy training ship that could be sent to sea. She and the Iky\u016b were the only ships of the Royal Navy fleet that had not been torpedoed during the Second World War. The Kido Butai, under the command of Captain Yukio Kato, anchored off the Maldives on 11 October in preparation for the raid.\nHowever, it was announced on 12 October 1943 that British convoys would be escorting the carriers for the rest of the war and that the Kido Butai must therefore take part in a Japanese submarine attack on an island instead of attacking carriers. The Shokaku and the Yokosuka were dispatched with another of the sisters, the Mikawa, to the Maldives, where on 6 November the Kido Butai attempted an underwater attack on a P & O merchant ship. This failed due to the carrier escort, which was unarmed, not having detected the submarine. It attempted a second attack the following day on the same vessel. This resulted in the sinking of the P & O  SS Electra in approximately 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) of water. Both the Japanese and the ship's captain were captured and given the choice of exchanging the ship for a prison camp in the Far East or becoming a POW. The captain and the captain of the Kido Butai were allotted to POW status; the Japanese accepted this as a tradeoff for their successful submarine attack. However, the Kido Butai was later lost in the Indian Ocean in the course of a patrol run, after the loss of the torpedo boat it was accompanied by.\nAfter the Battle of the Philippines in December 1942, the Kido Butai supported the landings in the Pacific Theatre. The war effort had to be changed when the Allies began their invasion of southern Europe in June 1944. It was decided that the ships would remain in the Pacific, in service with the Second Fleet. They conducted anti-submarine patrols for as long as the ships were operating and patrolled the waters around the Philippines and the Philippines, as well as those around Southeast Asia, as far as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\nOn 11 September 1945, the Kido Butai, at least its commander, was sunk south of Taiwan, during the course of the Battle of the Taiwan Strait.\nIn the early days of the war, the Kido Butai was used as a destroyer, and in 1942 was converted to escort carriers, taking on the name Kido butai.

{"prompt":"Greed was a financial disappointment . On its initial run , it earned $ 224 @ , @ 500 in the United States , $ 3 @ , @ 063 in Canada and $ 47","text":"Greed was a financial disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $ 224 @, @ 500 in the United States, $ 3 @, @ 063 in Canada and $ 47 @, @ 1560 in the United Kingdom for an eventual U.S. gross of $ 30,5 million. It grossed $ 1.1 million in Canada and $7 million in the United Kingdom and was canceled before three installments were made.\nIn 2008, the film was given a new directorial look by director Barry Sonnenfeld, who was inspired by his own childhood experiences with the cult of Greed, and he also recruited producer Joel Silver and actor Jon Voight to join the production.\nHe took on his favorite story from the series and expanded his characters to include a larger cast of antagonists, including the Scarlet King.\nHe then hired actor Christopher Walken to appear in a cameo role. Based on the film's original lineup, he plays the villainous character and is also able to play the character of Rorschach, as he is the only person to have seen the superhero from his flashback.\nThe production began in the summer of 2000 in Vancouver, British Columbia. After a long break from the role, Michael Keaton was chosen to play Batman in 2001.\nTo prepare for the project, Keaton spent six hours a day in a tank, which he helped to design with John DeWitt of the studio. To prepare for his role, Keaton kept a mental journal that included everything that influenced the character. He also recorded his thoughts with a voice-over on tape. To train himself in the ways of the Batman and the habits of the character, he visited the Batmobile, which was restored by DeWitt, and he also read many interviews with and discussions of Batman with Keaton.\nThe costumes of the cast were developed by costume designer John J. Johnson, who had earlier worked on Batman Begins.\nTo help prepare the actors for their roles, the studio hired an acting teacher in an effort to improve the acting of the cast, although the effort was ultimately in vain.\nIt was planned at one time for the actress Amy Adams to play the role of Lois Lane, who was not cast, leading many fans to believe that the actress was not cast because she would not have been as beautiful as Naomi Watts, who replaced Watts.\nHowever, the actress only accepted the role of Lois after the casting of Watts, and he was cast because her role was less demanding and because Lois Lane was seen as the arch enemy of Superman.\nThe role of Diana Prince \/ Wonder Woman was originally intended for Lynda Carter, who could not be cast due to scheduling conflicts. This led many fans to believe that Carter would not have been cast because she was a lesbian.\nDuring filming, actor Michael Shannon had to play a character that was supposed to be played by his friend and costar, and the two could not agree on the character.\nAt the request of the star, the character was eventually created. Also, a female version of Rorschach called Susan (who was played by Robin Wright ) and a female version of Silence called Susan (Bambi Bates ) appeared.\nDuring the third season of the series, the character of the Phantom Hourglass was seen in reverse, because it was a female who was seen on the

The manuscript was placed in","text":"The early history of the manuscript is unknown. In 1821 it was brought by general Colin Macaulay to England from the Greek island Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. The manuscript was placed in the British Museum Library in 1824 by the Greek ambassador to London Theodor Hatzidakis (1817\u201390). Later, the original Greek version of the work was lost during the Russian Empire's wars against the Ottoman Empire. The first English edition, with a translation by Dr James Thomson, was published in London in 1862. Since then the text has been published in a number of English translations, as well as in German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Polish. The Greek language manuscript is preserved in the Library of the Historical Society of Thessaloniki.\nThe work consists of four parts, with the fourth part being a supplement to the third:\nIn the first, the author explains the philosophy, morals and customs of Ancient Greece. The discussion of morals is especially insightful as it shows us the way in which the Greeks used a wide range of principles to interpret Greek customs and practices in relation to the individual. The second part discusses various aspects of ancient literature, with the author showing his familiarity with the work of Aristotle, Plato and other Greek and Roman authors. His account of poetry, philosophy, historiography, and drama is well-documented.\nVarious myths and legends are discussed in the third part, which deals specifically with the gods, heroes and magical oracles of Ancient Greece. The most detailed and authoritative description of the gods is the one of an oracle of Apollo at Delphi. The author describes the creation of the world, the gods, the order of things including the seasons, the seasons and the birth of the gods and heroes. At the beginning of the fourth part, the author explains the practice of marriage in Greece and the differences between marriage types in the ancient world. Most of the mythological and religious material from the book is in the form of ancient speeches. A number of such speeches from the book are translated in the New American Library edition.\nThe work was translated into English by George H. Schmidle. From the original of a volume of poems and speeches attributed to Herodotus, its title was given to two volumes of translations and excerpts presented by Schmidle in his edition of the works in the British Museum. The third and fourth parts were published as an appendix to a publication Herodotus (1873), with the fourth part being given in a separate supplement published in 1894.\n\nInfluence and reception\n\nThe book has been said to be the earliest of the New Testament histories, even though the exact date of its composition is uncertain. The first part of the work, dealing with ancient Greece, was the subject of a study by English historians Michael C. O'Gara and Kenneth J.

While the game is considered to be virtually identical across all platforms, differences in user interface, graphical quality, resolution and features can cause different user experiences.\n\" Dragon Age : Origins was an amazing game and a must have for this gaming generation. I have wanted to review the game since I first played it over ten years ago and have managed to gather some info for when I am writing the review. As soon as I finished Dragon Age 2, I began working on the reviews in earnest and I am very pleased that it has now been compiled into a single review.\"\n\" The game is a mixture of the two, with a few elements from Dragon Age 2 mixed in with very little from its predecessor and very few additions. The game is not so much an expansion but a very nice addition to what is already good and a great game, but just wouldn't be considered good enough to warrant an upgrade.\"\n\" Dragon Age is considered to be the successor to Dragon Age Origins, developed by BioWare and published by EA Games, and released as a single- player game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.\nBioWare originally planned to release the sequel in October 2011, with an April 2012 release date for the PC version.\nMany of the game's original features were retained, including questing with NPCs who offer various missions, a dungeon level editor and a character builder. However, new features and improvements were added, such as a better graphical and performance design, and a revamped combat system, allowing more versatility in combat style.\nSome features, such as the character customization system, were dropped in favor of simpler, more accessible features.\n\" Dragon Age 2 is a game that is still considered to be one of the most difficult action role playing games available. While the game is considered to be virtually identical across all platforms, differences in user interface, graphical quality, resolution and features can cause different user experiences.\nThis game has been released on Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation3, PlayStation4, Wii (Wii U Edition), PC (Windows), and PlayStation Vita.\nThe first game in the Dragon Age series was released in 2003 by BioWare and was the second entry in the Dragon Age series.\nThe second part features a larger amount of story and much more exploration than its predecessor. As well as a few new items to collect, this game has received better graphics than its predecessor and a more streamlined combat system and more weapons available.\nMany of the game\u2019s original features were retained, including questing with NPCs who offer various missions, a dungeon level editor and a character builder.\nWhat a difference a decade makes! While both games are still considered classics and must-haves for many gamers, the fact is that Dragon Age : Origins was released a decade ago.\nBoth the PC and the console versions of the game were also originally released, but the PC version has been ported to the console version several times.\nWe have decided to share this video which explains about the workings of some of the systems in our air conditioners and how we keep them working efficiently. We appreciate you watching!\nActress Regina Sir is on record admitting that she once shared a good times with the ex-girlfriend of actor Omawumi.","token_len":686,"entropy":[9.7051,6.0437,5.1104,10.9462,5.4645,0.2496,2.5478,5.3213,3.934,0.127,2.3484,9.0071,0.4694,0.1213,0.8995,4.2084,1.7965,1.2008,2.6979,4.6721,1.7562,0.1555,8.9354,2.0679,5.3393,0.9463,1.4435,0.3421,6.2003,1.2081,6.549,1.4963,1.795,3.7862,2.2347,0.4776,7.782,1.1773,4.8787,2.8928,2.6375,5.2779,4.9093,0.7323,0.5646,1.4026,10.1962,7.5305,0.013,4.3086,0.0107,2.5289,2.9816,3.1052,0.7896,2.3319,2.7293,3.2587,1.5238,0.5206,5.9421,6.0329,4.6934,1.2795,2.2556,2.953,5.898,0.2389,4.4205,2.3174,0.2963,1.9012,1.3119,1.4585,1.2899,0.1098,5.4449,3.3127,0.0305,0.0074,1.7011,2.6325,6.5045,0.1028,6.4529,3.0022,6.6961,3.5598,7.4309,1.1104,3.3261,4.3018,3.396,0.7333,0.7234,3.8056,4.399,0.0181,0.2095,2.9375,2.889,0.0004,5.027,0.925,0.2151,4.0686,4.2387,0.1502,1.411,5.7669,4.712,4.7027,1.6548,2.2435,1.9101,1.6939,1.6428,2.6638,3.2168,1.0538,4.241,1.224,7.4191,0.9943,0.5982,3.6793,2.4281,2.2156,1.2385,2.1139,3.04,1.8356,1.3882,1.8544,5.9544,0.0647,3.1296,3.3547,2.4901,1.6617,2.2051,2.9702,3.2912,3.4844,2.9671,0.0063,1.611,4.3539,0.5311,2.0006,6.4954,2.4024,1.9004,4.0301,0.4564,3.8959,5.4517,1.5949,3.571,1.059,1.7274,1.6434,1.3144,3.7414,5.6933,0.607,2.6542,3.1381,3.3531,1.2784,4.8131,4.7468,1.6991,0.492,4.876,1.9262,0.8184,5.6983,2.4425,3.8624,1.663,1.8031,3.2833,2.6253,5.718,6.3478,0.0016,2.1513,5.4765,4.5183,0.9473,1.4828,2.9528,2.4743,3.1508,2.5153,0.2451,0.8744,1.6875,0.0019,4.1294,6.9664,0.9924,0.0544,1.9411,4.9038,0.3018,0.8657,0.0081,2.5582,1.3552,7.5867,0.6628,3.0768,0.0049,1.4796,1.5648,0.1807,2.7194,3.2721,2.5753,1.5178,6.2253,3.7499,0.9428,2.9454,2.5274,8.6347,2.2953,2.4227,4.7547,0.5607,1.9996,1.1618,1.1752,0.6924,1.473,0.3421,0.5978,0.5283,0.1977,0.6955,1.5878,1.1569,0.0247,0.6657,3.474,5.3856,0.0016,4.5976,2.8041,0.6885,0.8654,1.8093,3.8786,2.1908,4.3568,2.8682,0.864,3.6392,3.6193,4.537,1.3461,0.5621,0.9726,2.2643,1.3547,1.9341,1.3072,0.9446,2.4282,6.4448,2.0585,0.2948,2.0984,0.1314,4.5322,1.5221,1.4811,4.3955,2.0084,1.4701,7.6683,1.8641,3.987,3.5916,5.3281,4.5867,3.4628,6.4587,1.44,3.2982,6.4432,4.8235,3.6558,1.6727,1.6598,4.4972,3.9994,0.9272,2.1543,0.0666,4.6794,1.2788,2.717,2.6797,0.86,0.952,1.7225,1.1005,0.0019,1.8769,5.2785,5.1819,3.0777,2.8451,4.8698,0.8723,1.9046,1.6814,3.8189,1.8611,0.0439,2.1318,2.9322,3.2557,6.5567,1.1515,0.7231,6.3192,0.5846,0.8624,4.624,3.1767,3.2832,0.1794,0.0009,1.1788,5.1576,3.7506,1.3831,0.5117,0.9904,5.2424,2.3832,0.7897,0.0043,6.0422,1.765,0.5353,6.0001,4.0811,1.5595,1.4534,2.0412,1.554,0.0018,1.9377,1.562,1.1658,3.3132,0.9879,2.1209,4.3722,4.743,1.1559,0.0556,1.7759,0.0182,0.0732,1.9337,4.0268,5.926,4.488,1.4795,0.196,5.0929,1.9312,3.0496,1.6487,1.7983,1.3076,3.9483,0.5578,0.073,6.2819,0.0605,0.2011,0.0759,0.0277,0.1156,0.1869,0.0104,0.0596,0.0034,0.0072,0.0523,0.0032,0.0036,0.0008,0.0111,0.0025,0.0029,0.0011,0.0017,0.0019,0.0045,0.3322,1.8924,4.4143,2.4383,2.1846,1.7528,4.9572,1.56,5.9188,1.1038,0.0016,0.9509,1.7681,1.9726,0.9908,0.2947,2.4786,0.526,0.3338,1.4476,6.7358,0.3586,1.6405,2.4119,0.2905,3.2762,6.8495,4.2547,0.0013,0.4581,3.5223,0.4153,3.8531,1.9951,4.325,1.3258,1.7415,1.5358,0.6842,0.44,0.8714,2.3821,3.9286,2.267,1.2462,0.3967,1.5217,0.0044,0.4194,1.1326,1.0486,0.9148,3.3402,3.2955,2.3043,0.0009,1.8917,1.8664,2.2898,3.6561,3.3209,0.1564,0.1267,1.3006,0.0074,0.6604,0.9655,1.6878,2.0864,3.2327,7.263,7.4231,1.632,5.8372,5.8523,0.0027,3.4068,1.4382,6.5494,0.7894,4.2062,2.576,2.8778,0.2144,0.6787,4.5505,2.3947,0.1644,2.3032,3.5971,0.8047,4.5758,3.1617,1.8975,0.4398,4.1396,1.0061,2.126,5.3312,6.4066,1.5673,2.9542,1.1183,0.1065,1.252,2.2676,2.6257,4.1849,1.158,0.0726,4.0396,2.6613,6.2322,4.8629,0.9395,0.5996,4.6132,0.6092,0.0902,1.6727,19.4892,7.4775,3.2004,2.5949,0.08,0.3766,0.072,0.0571,0.4046,0.598,0.0126,0.0736,0.0372,0.06,0.0241,0.0052,0.0172,0.0225,0.0135,0.0225,0.0008,0.0007,0.013,0.0069,0.0034,0.0036,0.0313,4.5968,7.1643,5.7597,2.8626,0.8043,3.7122,0.2459,1.8301,5.1053,5.4377,1.7979,1.4904,2.6827,0.3963,3.3383,2.9682,5.0944,1.8624,4.3312,0.0005,2.439,2.3586,0.8559,0.1913,1.7111,3.3368,2.7692,0.2855,1.6555,0.0011,4.831,0.0048,2.336,3.1532,4.367,1.8837,0.8213,1.9563,1.5618,5.6828,4.0511,3.2111,0.8441,2.2893,2.8619,0.1303,0.6948,1.5013,0.3104,1.6924,4.6727,6.1803,0.7006,3.8279,1.4363,1.8932,1.5017,0.2619,3.04,1.2415,3.4776,0.5441,0.9958,1.5324,2.0681,6.2038,0.1191,0.9294,0.9346,5.859,2.1032,5.1986,0.1837,4.0254,2.8141,4.711,5.5269,3.8152,6.5444,0.8287,10.7161,0.1004,6.0813,0.2793,0.102,5.5806,2.2959,5.5329,12.6673,4.9379,2.7037,1.633,1.8819,2.3606,5.6922,1.0589,2.1051,6.5591,0.6752,3.1609,7.0231,2.4433,3.6987,3.1462,0.4793,9.6341,3.1693,7.7434,10.6399,6.8777,5.6693,6.4378,8.5098,0.5873,0.6864,5.6474,6.601,1.0185,6.4395,7.8404,0.9484,1.9231,7.43,0.2237,4.4418,0.2519,6.2312,11.6395,6.1279,8.061,4.6159]}

Its occupation is probably continuous in time and it is likely we may reach the end and beginnings of agriculture there soon. The complex nature of its occupation is yet to fully be understood. It is the first stone tool site in the south-west of Scotland and is significant in the history of the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. #ScottishArchaeology PI:USER #ancorran #neolithica #ancorranwmc\nAs the week is ending and we all get busy preparing for Christmas, we wanted to send a big thank you to all of the teams that did such a good job on the recent Christmas clean up of the area surrounding our office.\nThe area was littered left and right, in a rather shabby state, with garbage, debris, and broken glass. Our own team made tremendous progress in getting the area cleaned up.\nI was so impressed with the team members who volunteered to get up and get dirty, and I would like to particularly thank our Director, Dwayne W. Johnson, for his dedication to clean up, and also thank the students for their good work.\nThe new year is a time for us to be thankful for what we have and to look to the future with hopes and expectations much higher that the last.\nWe want to thank you again for your continued support of our school, students, parents, and staff. We thank the community for coming together and helping us to take more steps toward creating a safer and more clean environment to teach and work in. Our goal is for all students to have a safe and positive classroom experience.\nWe invite any students who have an area they would like to focus specifically on for cleaning, we would like to hear about it. Please take the time to contact Dwayne Johnson as well as any other member of our team. Students with clean areas have won prizes, have helped clean up school sites, and have had their names placed on the \u201cArea of the Week\u201d list on our website and blog.\nWe will be looking into ways to make it even easier to get involved in helping to keep our school a clean place.\nWe look ahead to a new year full of learning. We thank you for your continued support and help in making our students successful learners.\nHOLIDAY LOAN APPLY: PLEASE TAKE TIME TO COMPLETE THIS FORM AND RETURN IT WITH A CHECK AT ONE OF THE DEPTS DURING THE WINTER BREAK!\nAfter the announcement by FIA Director of Motorsport, Jean Todt, that WRC teams will be allowed to drive the same car twice in a season the discussion was at it\u2019s peak.\nAlthough the idea is interesting but is the same technology to be used in Formula E already? Can manufacturers drive the cars twice in a season?\nIn Formula 1, the cars are tested for more than 50 hours during two months which makes it quite impossible in the championship that the cars can be tested for so long.\nBut could FIA consider shortened testing? With shortened testing maybe the teams can use the same car for a long time and also with shortened testing that could allow the teams to test and re-test the same car.","token_len":687,"entropy":[12.1357,4.6556,6.3013,11.7886,7.0322,4.9406,6.4896,4.9543,3.1621,8.4934,9.8938,2.6429,1.9051,3.5075,0.0596,2.0993,0.7924,4.8784,7.1163,11.7049,7.3393,4.2656,9.8103,10.4089,5.7554,5.1205,6.9484,4.895,0.1074,0.3256,1.6013,3.7991,0.5098,0.4213,6.3318,1.2674,4.4994,7.3486,1.6477,4.669,7.693,4.1675,4.9465,1.6911,3.4565,1.1171,4.2434,5.8789,3.3412,6.339,1.3657,2.2415,6.7159,8.2661,0.03,5.3625,4.8976,4.0398,0.6476,2.3792,6.5814,5.1731,0.0428,2.3225,3.3267,1.9996,6.5083,0.3304,5.5027,0.5857,1.5068,0.8228,2.7563,0.7757,4.2519,2.1947,5.7454,3.5933,5.3801,1.0211,1.5977,5.7628,2.216,1.3588,0.4209,0.4233,1.6329,2.2137,6.4551,2.2271,1.3072,2.278,0.0502,1.4227,5.8441,0.0075,2.5275,2.8897,0.3925,0.1305,0.8951,5.8539,8.9209,0.1,4.7814,0.3063,0.1639,13.9378,3.5411,13.921,4.1839,9.9828,4.369,1.5284,1.5325,5.3152,8.1802,8.4183,0.8207,6.8461,0.1439,0.1233,7.3597,6.7172,3.9372,9.878,3.2799,8.3365,4.6378,3.0255,1.8949,2.4182,4.3885,3.4134,4.711,4.6355,0.7193,4.3565,0.8561,1.5455,5.3861,0.0396,5.2518,1.2751,4.0314,0.8783,0.0813,0.2201,2.6724,1.261,1.533,5.2418,1.8595,5.1631,4.0078,0.8391,3.3674,0.0065,2.5646,1.4548,6.756,4.9802,9.1785,0.8869,2.9896,0.7625,4.2132,5.9007,2.7354,4.7806,0.7062,2.8314,2.786,5.7671,2.9947,5.6321,11.3693,0.6805,0.0129,3.0268,4.8465,2.7649,5.4865,7.0578,0.2706,2.4308,1.7438,0.8818,5.5705,1.6425,3.818,0.7322,1.5948,3.7661,1.7728,0.7705,4.4692,4.8717,2.4323,4.7829,8.1275,2.6661,1.6738,3.3529,1.7078,1.5112,1.4283,0.2611,2.1105,1.8343,3.5471,3.2737,3.6109,2.6844,0.9043,0.7531,2.645,4.9473,2.1386,5.8613,0.9363,4.7515,4.5286,1.5721,3.5292,5.6309,2.4717,1.7677,2.2505,3.4759,1.4174,0.0223,7.6043,0.1956,3.8445,6.0599,1.7563,6.0952,4.0667,5.2804,2.224,4.9102,0.9498,0.7701,0.9833,4.0003,1.1045,3.8832,0.1834,4.3001,1.0324,3.5027,5.3405,1.7022,6.2825,2.227,0.5689,5.2538,0.3751,1.4921,0.9057,2.3769,5.5122,3.9044,1.4238,2.6353,2.9402,1.3839,3.8838,0.249,3.3928,3.461,0.4801,3.0395,0.6065,0.6626,3.2798,1.4186,3.9088,4.4284,1.0742,0.225,2.6907,5.6465,2.5103,2.682,7.8832,0.5869,5.8621,2.8701,3.1183,3.786,0.9336,3.0569,4.131,0.18,0.8914,2.6282,3.386,0.5296,1.0301,2.4491,0.4277,1.717,1.2206,5.9984,1.8414,4.9874,0.1805,4.8652,0.2549,0.7036,1.6731,0.5507,1.918,4.3053,4.1087,3.869,0.7806,4.3607,1.1867,1.3642,3.0962,0.9662,2.0187,4.4566,6.2583,2.1729,3.2166,4.2888,0.6501,4.0076,1.2502,0.7538,6.2418,1.0334,5.08,3.4349,1.9203,4.5144,1.6432,0.339,4.9672,4.1414,0.4588,3.1548,2.8017,3.0719,0.5176,1.9001,0.7574,1.2024,0.6027,4.2205,6.3267,2.988,1.3767,0.8117,2.1218,5.7655,5.7294,2.6795,1.3844,1.6218,4.4441,5.4983,3.5641,1.6628,0.04,0.1275,5.6286,6.9475,0.0785,4.4787,3.682,3.052,5.5765,2.1318,1.655,0.1924,1.9126,2.377,2.1521,1.135,2.5588,4.2982,2.4729,0.1405,0.0848,2.6863,4.691,0.0189,2.4731,4.6716,0.9761,0.6484,2.2336,1.5968,5.6396,0.0315,1.2438,1.0915,1.706,8.4304,4.5234,6.6357,2.1573,4.0723,7.9445,3.3469,2.3476,4.1488,3.931,5.0413,0.7104,5.392,4.9509,0.5653,0.5309,1.1173,3.5871,1.8551,3.8489,3.6471,0.6594,1.3211,11.825,8.0287,10.4875,4.1883,2.5162,3.3443,1.1476,7.801,3.1437,4.0939,1.7911,1.4403,3.4867,4.3281,0.2129,1.0779,1.8638,2.9648,1.4202,3.2895,2.917,4.1484,0.262,3.1657,2.2792,3.2461,1.1059,1.8609,2.2611,2.6412,0.8608,3.7322,2.3772,3.9998,1.5983,1.4283,4.1688,2.2728,1.4258,0.75,1.3876,1.8907,2.7438,8.7009,0.2323,3.6215,2.5465,0.3028,5.236,0.0065,5.6111,2.5007,1.855,4.2438,0.4216,1.198,0.6956,1.4989,0.1666,1.2236,4.2276,2.1743,2.6197,1.4253,4.9455,5.8934,4.9246,0.5381,0.7744,6.7459,6.4452,2.7894,0.0023,6.815,4.0137,8.7321,3.3356,1.1661,3.3286,5.3619,4.1867,0.0006,4.1985,0.3148,5.8634,0.4793,1.5651,5.2464,2.2962,5.9823,0.0998,1.0046,3.4161,1.2379,5.2844,0.3117,5.7166,6.0681,0.4843,0.8008,5.7271,2.8093,9.2178,6.6868,2.1981,0.0134,0.8459,7.2196,2.0752,5.6356,0.3452,3.8949,0.8656,6.0452,1.471,6.2231,4.634,12.8354,4.9809,1.4531,9.6343,1.8783,6.6478,2.8992,0.8371,0.3776,0.7531,1.664,6.2166,4.1531,5.3545,1.4354,0.747,2.3139,0.1777,4.0953,2.6093,5.2282,2.8175,5.822,1.5498,2.2862,1.5714,6.1641,9.0864,3.1018,5.4443,6.3544,16.0778,7.059,5.346,4.9498,0.7834,1.8537,6.1172,1.7457,4.7333,2.994,5.6612,4.9515,3.6718,5.3295,2.9306,8.0569,5.0913,2.1177,0.3352,1.2128,3.4628,2.7761,8.1922,4.4966,5.34,8.1104,4.8678,2.0288,6.5458,3.2826,0.8751,0.5451,0.1791,1.2128,1.4864,3.9664,4.0211,3.6066,0.8749,1.7725,2.4677,0.9534,5.2339,2.7187,5.9075,0.1165,4.3627,3.0367,4.1698,5.4034,5.2293,5.828,4.3043,1.0794,3.499,5.6798,5.8213,1.9507,5.7934,4.3171,1.7046,1.6116,2.5149,1.0116,2.2368,1.3933,4.6483,0.3088,0.5002,1.6174,4.5997,6.7019,4.11,5.7869,11.1112,2.5408,3.8742,5.56,5.9971,0.4333,7.278,2.307,2.8587,1.6433,3.3156,1.3188,1.4467,1.9889,2.1069,2.1389,3.6122,0.5467,2.1498,4.7883,4.8994,4.8437,0.4563,4.5592,2.4636,2.4369,1.7556,0.7976,0.1474,3.2028,4.1784,5.423,0.1089,0.4157,1.2603,2.5069,0.5636,2.459]}

It was great and I am so excited \u2013 but like any good system, it will take some getting used to.","token_len":687,"entropy":[5.5719,8.9143,9.1999,7.4687,4.1835,1.0777,6.6977,7.3238,0.8685,2.1371,6.5396,5.3769,3.8105,2.2222,0.2345,0.1417,1.344,1.6909,6.2136,1.3344,2.1493,4.4279,9.0489,7.3432,1.3885,1.7026,1.6686,5.0504,6.8773,1.7294,4.6303,1.3846,1.3435,1.2319,2.6698,4.2859,3.1998,0.3581,1.0899,3.9373,0.7205,3.8716,5.0263,0.1697,1.0098,3.49,1.6174,5.5303,0.2731,0.3276,0.0295,4.9745,9.1257,3.0741,8.5522,3.6491,2.8902,1.114,6.2509,5.407,1.0789,6.4005,1.891,6.4854,4.0605,2.5674,1.9274,1.443,5.4552,4.8483,5.1783,1.344,1.9852,0.8022,4.6875,0.4061,0.2807,3.4968,6.9315,2.5686,6.9093,0.09,2.7723,4.6279,1.206,3.9341,4.271,3.2883,4.6273,0.7172,2.2435,0.28,1.8796,5.183,2.0219,3.6396,1.2998,2.2773,5.6718,1.4573,2.3433,0.0573,1.5268,5.546,2.5229,2.0565,2.0132,9.6792,0.4968,1.3841,0.6611,5.1337,2.1511,2.1428,1.8078,1.1175,1.6572,7.6843,2.8163,1.8907,4.2872,8.8957,7.3342,1.9854,0.0338,3.1682,0.6076,0.1048,5.0535,2.7283,2.7347,0.6736,3.0619,1.3542,1.1254,3.4628,3.979,1.1276,0.4919,5.4572,6.6591,0.8178,0.0032,2.396,2.2821,1.0268,2.7004,3.6554,4.9127,8.1282,0.1512,0.4699,2.6445,5.4447,0.0878,1.539,1.8178,2.6371,5.0662,3.1482,1.3836,2.704,1.934,11.1591,1.0963,8.2925,4.9822,9.093,1.3008,4.771,6.0147,5.6997,6.0402,4.5632,6.641,2.299,1.5517,0.6031,0.0053,0.046,1.2934,0.1436,0.0002,0.2357,8.7927,1.7924,3.3861,3.5072,0.3055,10.9206,3.785,0.2744,9.3713,3.913,4.3611,0.2042,6.2344,0.37,1.3848,6.5752,4.2052,1.0854,0.8949,2.3424,3.1185,2.8688,5.5078,4.3996,5.4206,3.8134,2.2821,3.6549,1.7633,0.6598,4.3542,2.5981,1.45,2.6924,5.1266,0.2333,2.1685,4.6156,0.0091,4.9166,4.4686,2.5801,0.427,0.0078,0.0654,2.6681,4.0388,4.3762,3.4378,0.4693,8.7728,5.626,0.2517,6.004,5.7679,3.4697,1.0251,0.3053,5.9617,0.5371,0.0075,3.1025,1.3952,2.4178,0.3744,0.7999,4.1095,1.9682,2.3032,3.232,2.9098,5.3534,2.1496,2.8887,0.5187,1.9535,6.376,2.3053,3.4372,0.541,0.0189,1.139,5.3839,0.2713,6.7605,4.8119,3.9611,1.7919,0.0068,1.3548,1.8554,6.8923,0.9859,3.362,2.1001,0.1632,2.4554,0.9487,0.0026,0.0048,1.8582,1.723,1.6542,0.0128,8.3607,5.3558,4.8672,2.6031,2.1227,7.3407,12.345,4.4634,2.5647,6.9163,0.2968,6.1397,3.2685,5.2879,1.8971,0.6305,0.2012,2.9,3.1098,0.4341,2.9287,0.7355,1.4901,5.1907,5.1692,2.6047,5.3536,2.5433,5.3468,1.7675,6.5011,0.6468,3.4813,5.5878,4.7463,2.8855,3.3477,0.0265,6.3732,8.1542,8.3207,2.5575,1.3714,5.9709,6.6886,4.9738,2.8086,5.8756,0.6693,2.248,5.3194,3.8728,0.9365,2.1224,2.6631,3.0127,5.4999,1.412,3.3057,4.3685,13.2131,1.1355,2.0678,3.0612,0.548,1.2787,2.1065,0.0106,3.686,1.3868,4.3618,1.7288,0.9605,3.4384,0.2625,3.9177,0.3644,0.0737,0.0004,0.0002,1.3698,3.6999,1.2964,3.6871,0.9384,2.3643,0.0178,6.9027,1.2795,0.8015,6.3687,1.0022,0.297,3.1005,2.0211,1.7491,0.0017,3.0329,4.643,0.9005,0.3898,5.6104,4.2752,6.6638,5.0834,8.3174,0.0209,5.9561,8.0074,2.5029,0.5966,1.6135,0.2086,0.5216,4.6223,2.1133,5.9748,2.8959,2.6345,0.1683,8.252,0.73,0.2806,0.0277,0.1506,0.7921,4.3087,4.1131,16.0126,7.2914,0.5647,2.9265,2.0,2.2776,3.3512,2.5906,3.917,3.3375,3.3444,1.3209,3.2232,0.883,2.0962,3.7298,3.7169,0.0153,1.3505,1.1088,2.2774,0.9602,0.7735,2.7307,2.9441,0.7337,1.7535,3.291,0.0789,0.6591,1.7793,4.3266,5.7591,5.8221,5.4695,0.421,0.0509,6.2722,1.1225,4.5217,5.0502,0.1268,0.8424,5.0508,3.2274,0.0796,1.5918,7.3538,2.0954,1.1707,3.0545,1.6162,2.9172,0.5546,6.1383,3.4548,0.1954,3.1594,3.0859,5.0782,4.9115,6.2432,5.5418,1.1537,1.2245,3.3945,1.5117,3.9092,3.0195,3.2465,3.4843,0.6652,4.2655,0.189,5.4586,1.9063,4.4357,1.8194,1.0177,0.3516,1.0101,0.0591,3.5461,3.9524,1.1433,1.3169,0.7304,4.4145,0.26,0.8686,8.9627,5.3094,6.6988,1.1552,1.0092,0.348,2.2074,4.0542,0.0496,2.0576,0.0491,0.3197,2.9321,1.6313,5.6897,1.6025,1.8172,0.0039,0.0903,0.0646,0.4977,1.1744,1.4358,6.5303,4.1055,4.2455,3.2409,2.3444,5.2753,3.3794,5.5066,6.816,6.7234,0.5316,0.1052,0.1046,4.1123,4.9528,1.3641,4.875,0.8385,0.6563,0.9903,4.4302,1.061,1.4674,1.7253,5.8738,0.8924,2.3152,0.7563,2.9103,4.1801,3.1792,0.5641,4.0658,0.5666,3.843,1.9165,0.4598,5.1632,1.1691,2.9999,2.643,4.9291,4.4696,4.962,1.6666,1.7048,3.7465,5.38,6.5699,2.4794,1.2892,2.0055,5.4946,3.8888,7.7619,0.73,1.8821,2.1215,3.3211,4.4975,4.7394,2.5751,0.5254,2.0775,5.806,3.2459,6.1272,7.8945,5.9026,3.0801,2.647,4.0023,5.6277,2.8691,3.1682,0.0173,1.0001,0.4101,2.4163,2.013,3.845,2.8916,6.9109,2.5615,5.012,2.6251,5.7912,2.7418,0.2746,6.5325,1.1131,7.2471,0.9208,2.8128,2.3988,0.5355,1.592,3.3709,8.3628,2.6668,6.4214,6.786,1.6176,6.3118,3.9108,2.3672,2.199,2.6589,7.1628,4.4026,2.8221,4.6039,6.4918,0.7805,2.7971,6.2254,1.5738,3.1617,3.1442,4.8434,1.7405,3.9697,5.1738,3.0432,5.1932,0.4161,4.9921,1.2791,3.2105,0.2349,1.5652,2.6216,2.5104,1.5997,2.2389,0.9982,4.3647,3.2109,1.7504,3.0677,2.4082,2.5219,5.5255,3.1532,6.3848,2.7778,1.8152,5.4596,0.6356,0.9736,3.3785,1.5202,1.9125,4.1629,0.0096,0.0046,0.4109]}

In the season's climax, a murderer named Tommy Flom (John Hurt) shows up in town and he is determined to destroy Dale (Kyle MacLachlan), and also seems to be working with the police.","token_len":687,"entropy":[7.5489,3.6781,0.5326,8.6284,1.7259,1.447,5.5173,0.4263,1.8568,1.3803,10.0956,0.8261,0.7814,4.2581,0.1234,10.1616,1.9244,2.8569,0.0372,4.5819,11.6801,0.0989,1.8312,2.1503,1.1794,2.2004,4.9564,0.9173,0.055,0.4821,3.0463,5.4168,6.6071,11.67,0.5592,0.0028,0.3361,7.2727,0.9042,0.0,11.7583,2.3573,3.5111,0.5386,0.0512,4.3228,0.5087,5.5754,8.7079,0.365,3.7053,0.3168,4.3354,1.8434,4.4061,3.6768,1.6402,0.3879,0.6087,3.9924,2.472,2.8674,2.9097,0.6476,1.997,6.06,5.0435,3.9031,3.5249,5.7582,7.523,2.5694,7.056,4.3075,4.7016,1.3995,4.9433,3.111,4.4638,2.8177,4.9342,4.1731,8.5246,0.6752,3.2209,0.4777,5.5198,2.6201,1.2198,3.4727,0.0534,1.8104,6.6132,0.1869,2.7587,5.0769,0.405,3.1324,5.6779,9.1406,3.0913,4.1197,2.8041,2.6921,6.6036,13.4016,3.4166,5.5422,5.4588,3.2407,1.3052,5.1936,0.6712,1.9643,2.6833,0.1298,2.5679,3.7565,7.7471,1.1348,5.7307,1.6267,0.3316,0.3257,0.0016,0.4822,3.472,4.7039,0.2917,0.0289,0.0057,0.7578,3.3037,1.9384,0.9046,5.9718,3.4,0.0607,1.3406,2.6682,0.4385,2.103,6.2371,4.5546,5.5059,2.6749,2.035,3.9172,0.6422,6.1266,5.0014,2.1693,1.2596,3.1655,1.6792,3.5788,1.897,2.713,6.2511,6.7399,2.2237,4.0424,6.2708,1.3901,5.8558,0.4354,1.0846,2.9788,0.6846,2.9811,2.4134,0.0003,0.847,6.4304,1.2954,5.8632,1.2295,1.0969,3.1387,4.7455,0.5552,1.8113,8.2293,2.2839,1.3626,2.0954,2.0585,2.7245,0.1697,0.4945,4.4272,2.0871,3.7198,1.8574,2.2683,7.1533,4.3446,0.5635,1.4786,1.1604,1.1267,5.6809,0.3481,0.3403,3.6837,0.471,2.765,2.2885,5.5618,0.0898,7.9855,5.1102,0.0468,0.0135,0.001,5.4755,1.207,5.6698,2.0747,1.9753,0.4064,3.6935,0.545,2.5178,3.6193,3.3956,6.0498,4.906,3.2245,4.9921,6.3179,1.6526,6.4057,4.8327,0.0922,1.7142,6.3558,3.7276,0.5762,1.4971,5.4326,0.0187,1.9743,0.923,2.3314,3.0154,4.2328,1.0556,2.4044,1.4001,1.864,2.3741,3.1527,2.1324,1.3555,7.6042,6.1868,2.5318,5.4687,0.5193,1.2683,3.4,3.9355,1.7269,0.0096,1.0587,0.1466,2.015,2.3274,0.0002,0.0128,0.847,0.8486,2.2973,5.1913,3.595,0.6392,0.0082,0.1357,0.0003,0.001,0.2314,2.6363,0.0013,0.0003,0.0073,2.2101,1.7265,2.8854,2.8837,1.0605,1.7183,4.3562,0.6372,0.7879,3.7113,2.0412,1.2798,1.1372,0.0067,0.8755,5.8805,3.2703,2.9311,1.4605,1.896,4.357,3.255,1.1019,3.9729,3.1582,4.2195,3.3138,1.8748,1.2055,0.571,0.1663,6.4544,0.7846,5.785,0.1051,2.6002,3.094,1.2691,0.0503,0.0005,0.0011,0.0004,0.8283,2.5102,0.8207,5.4143,0.4359,0.0017,0.0856,0.0059,0.4955,8.9768,0.4008,1.6391,5.5054,4.3024,0.461,0.0218,0.0062,0.0079,3.6197,4.651,0.3607,0.8209,0.9299,0.3477,2.4265,5.9628,2.4353,0.0717,4.1827,1.5274,0.5639,2.579,1.2436,1.8354,0.1321,1.0985,2.7476,0.0039,1.0173,0.0716,4.8449,1.9872,2.8366,4.895,1.9823,4.0273,6.0042,0.5011,0.0041,0.0001,2.0777,0.5188,2.4135,6.437,2.9338,5.7066,3.7324,2.5714,6.3857,3.8585,1.0256,5.6368,0.509,0.0689,0.0008,5.1619,1.0218,1.0557,0.0016,0.629,3.4503,1.8517,2.1224,3.217,0.2875,7.5421,0.6114,0.5386,0.8579,0.342,3.4848,0.9533,0.3853,0.7474,1.3959,1.2591,2.4616,1.1642,0.354,2.3217,1.2146,0.7859,1.0488,3.6743,0.1965,0.8285,0.7233,3.3271,0.5519,0.2543,0.2882,0.9458,4.0296,4.9544,0.1716,1.0159,5.9298,3.2891,5.5244,1.5073,4.1181,1.1214,0.4805,0.3943,4.542,0.1824,2.6767,4.5204,7.9096,1.6847,2.2632,1.2298,1.0323,0.4159,2.1157,0.3519,1.2564,0.7353,9.4217,0.6854,3.1025,0.7524,0.6271,0.2874,0.002,0.3346,3.1499,2.4012,1.0529,4.5443,3.698,4.7458,0.0017,2.191,1.5312,1.2427,1.4609,3.0608,1.6362,0.2441,6.1424,1.4824,0.2904,0.1596,0.0725,0.0683,0.0631,0.0261,6.2239,2.1002,0.16,0.0046,0.0006,0.0015,0.0004,0.2886,4.9725,2.6412,5.1793,2.9256,1.6819,1.2658,8.9967,8.2622,0.3072,3.981,8.2726,2.3615,6.1208,0.7346,4.9488,0.0097,2.0271,1.2572,1.649,1.9389,2.9456,5.4299,0.7289,2.4234,0.1483,6.4536,1.7086,0.3801,4.2277,4.6627,2.1792,5.2765,0.4722,0.0958,0.0546,0.0034,0.0003,0.0004,0.2345,4.778,1.1313,4.1683,1.8685,2.2816,0.918,1.0196,2.2754,5.1053,0.4567,1.2135,2.4552,3.6736,0.1015,0.8331,5.478,1.9199,6.4864,2.4448,5.7285,0.0663,2.0537,4.8785,2.5363,2.1768,1.324,1.3638,0.9258,0.3686,1.6225,0.0502,0.0546,1.0454,0.2969,0.5315,2.3925,0.1208,0.2242,3.8859,2.4025,0.8119,0.9805,1.8135,0.5393,1.725,0.2217,2.2112,1.1417,0.7725,2.7826,3.81,1.221,1.014,0.4723,3.2172,5.1143,1.3011,2.2684,1.1838,6.689,0.0153,0.8376,2.1536,0.0035,3.2999,1.7354,6.6178,2.9693,1.4821,2.2269,4.6557,0.0008,0.0059,1.0329,4.926,5.987,0.3847,8.2724,5.5687,0.7339,1.4532,0.496,1.0554,5.7995,1.1763,0.2582,9.9428,4.129,3.3902,0.3685,2.2176,0.3844,1.4645,0.3749,0.4843,0.6677,0.7268,0.698,1.8776,0.3317,0.1259,2.4552,0.2661,0.0229,0.0327,0.006,0.0063,0.0454,0.0268,3.5066,0.6767,2.8094,0.6959,2.0534,0.072,2.8339,6.7667,1.8206,7.8208,8.7221,5.9978,0.9517,4.2098,5.3963,0.3343,3.5478,0.0047,1.4157,0.6436,1.6231,3.0577,1.1783,3.2057,0.0445,5.5138,2.9338,1.5183,0.0878,0.0038,0.0009,0.0017,0.0007,1.3198,1.5245,5.0785,6.1864,0.0703,0.4886,4.5253,1.1412,1.7925,2.0594,1.5944]}

At the instigation of his American publisher , George","text":"Walpole remained prolific in the post @ - @ war years, and began a parallel and highly remunerative career as a lecturer in literature. At the instigation of his American publisher, George Knopf, Wolverton undertook several lectures in Boston in 1905, at the Harvard School of the Arts. This was the third and concluding of these three lectures ; in the two previous lectures, he had discussed the works of Shakespeare and of Henry James ; in this lecture, he turned his attention to the works of Thomas Wolfe. Having already made some passing references to James in his preface to the second lecture, he now gave a very full discussion of Wolfe.\nIn spite of the fact that Wolfe had just been made an Honorary Fellow of the New York Academy of Arts, Wolverton found it impossible to take him up on his offer of introducing him, after the lecture, to the members. In the following paragraph, he makes some pointed remarks about the difficulties of writing a biography of an unknown author, and concludes that to put his lecture into book form would mean giving up on Wolfe entirely:\nI cannot present Wolfe at all as a writer. The most difficult thing to do is to try to see at all the writer who never pretends to write. If I say that I can see the writer in Charles Revere Chase, people might take it, probably would, that I mean a very different one in some sense from the one I try to define. But that is how I am trying to describe the man, and not an author as any reader is likely to come to conceive an author to be.\nThis was a very interesting lecture, and Wolverton drew a sharp distinction between the artist and the writer in it, but unfortunately, he was forced to do this on a case-by-case basis:\nThe artist is himself his inspiration... he would not put his work in the safe keeping of any one else, and, except that the reader does the critical work for him, the artist himself is responsible for his work. It is a different matter with the writer, of course. He has not to take any advice from the reader of his critics. And as an artist he can be helped and pushed along quite a bit by the critic. But we find that the writer, as a rule, is able to keep his own counsel all through: he has his own style, his own vision ; he is not afraid to write against everything, and especially against himself, if, to paraphrase a French saying, in time he has become afraid of being his own critic. This, of course, he can do by making himself his own patron.\nHe then continues to discuss how Wolfe, following the dictates of his own conscience, rejected two important manuscripts that would have resulted in his achieving success ;\nIt is, perhaps, for this very reason that there is not much which one can teach an author how to write a book ; he is the best person to do it himself.\nBut here Wolverton is obliged to leave things a little hanging, and says that the writer need not be afraid of being his own critic; instead, he should be able to do something else (the only thing he ever did, it seems to me) in being his own patron. For he believes that both the writer and the artist had to sacrifice something, that both were in danger of becoming complacent and insensitive :","token_len":688,"entropy":[10.712,9.2696,9.9409,1.4365,1.3323,5.6461,13.7307,9.2625,4.846,8.3325,6.7291,1.8312,2.5129,6.366,3.1326,8.77,5.5641,5.1505,9.9986,0.5127,0.0729,0.5643,2.0883,0.8545,7.1877,1.5998,5.3037,1.7937,4.2218,1.2018,9.3539,0.0291,0.0324,2.0572,6.6833,3.8161,0.7171,4.1905,7.6447,1.9385,0.0411,0.4024,12.9138,3.1198,6.5642,5.2465,4.9961,1.7504,6.9249,2.5181,5.2962,1.2762,3.2398,1.904,6.0518,2.5593,0.0761,3.75,0.0929,1.4907,3.426,1.7467,2.0826,5.5531,2.7612,6.8441,4.2549,6.2684,2.8838,1.9496,8.6739,3.4624,2.1839,6.265,3.6515,0.6058,1.7001,2.0151,1.2992,5.5112,1.1564,5.9784,0.1123,4.3355,1.1367,3.6529,4.3108,2.085,2.9772,0.8764,3.7945,1.9439,1.0357,1.2948,6.8202,2.0143,0.1232,0.1789,0.8793,2.6014,0.0402,4.5005,5.5081,1.8831,6.2352,4.3755,3.2916,3.3772,7.8451,5.0447,0.1525,5.2186,2.54,0.6578,4.8191,0.0409,0.4556,1.7148,2.6204,2.6886,0.3625,1.0943,3.6974,4.1945,1.3751,4.1192,4.6865,4.4553,0.1702,3.7195,2.7414,3.5098,7.163,5.362,0.0042,1.3736,2.3679,0.0544,3.9352,1.722,5.6733,2.2901,4.822,2.2443,6.6028,0.0056,1.3034,0.6993,0.2496,5.0076,0.6207,1.7762,0.1715,1.5533,1.386,5.3691,0.004,4.8661,1.8855,2.0656,0.2283,4.1609,2.1216,3.3842,0.5377,0.9992,0.1804,1.7411,7.1699,0.9804,4.294,4.9228,2.1587,3.9067,2.2213,0.528,0.9107,7.6351,4.6412,2.6892,1.5733,3.0821,6.7789,0.6184,0.8791,4.0721,3.3657,6.109,0.7758,1.9189,1.1204,4.7715,1.0834,6.2568,1.5888,4.6364,0.6117,3.3884,5.063,1.0706,1.2606,1.1218,3.9555,1.2783,5.4526,4.7699,2.838,5.7882,2.5246,6.7917,0.0976,1.2483,4.097,4.5942,1.1232,2.4658,3.3282,4.1379,4.6759,0.478,3.0584,3.8625,8.0078,5.0232,3.1636,1.3612,2.0968,0.8212,3.3921,1.7743,2.8173,4.1043,4.5214,1.6562,1.7879,0.7158,0.542,0.3147,4.5881,0.4847,6.1211,5.2751,3.3344,2.291,6.4869,2.6378,5.8449,7.9326,0.0088,0.1882,2.4373,1.718,3.1871,1.4726,4.9844,1.241,1.7288,3.7749,3.9014,2.2915,1.3527,2.3917,7.48,7.7897,2.9018,13.6472,0.6276,8.6318,4.5352,4.6518,1.4497,4.4394,6.9399,5.6126,2.6907,3.0215,1.6391,5.7829,3.2587,3.5836,2.9472,4.9109,4.2095,4.7988,3.1948,1.4207,1.4148,0.6053,1.4136,6.9036,0.0569,6.132,0.896,2.0597,3.5652,1.0303,5.4684,1.1667,3.1567,4.1825,0.2381,2.683,1.5674,2.8149,2.017,1.4044,2.7499,4.2315,3.7464,4.966,5.3064,6.5033,4.2751,2.765,0.0215,5.0135,0.7032,7.7731,6.3941,1.5237,2.9126,0.4224,0.4263,2.0755,2.9631,2.4104,2.0538,1.8484,2.3171,1.7727,0.9494,0.7001,5.655,0.002,6.5215,2.4539,4.5952,0.6331,0.0728,1.264,7.4441,0.6362,0.2883,1.0716,2.6188,3.2077,1.6481,3.5083,6.6148,1.9561,1.9772,1.7376,3.8023,0.1541,4.7543,2.4767,3.6494,3.0566,4.2042,1.6749,0.0031,0.0014,0.0003,0.0071,4.2598,1.5355,2.2857,2.1222,1.4,7.4198,6.6166,7.7976,6.8001,3.6668,5.1702,1.8643,4.7506,1.8144,2.5506,1.7293,2.0248,9.8183,7.1093,0.4059,3.1715,1.8129,4.5176,1.2051,1.8001,4.1461,6.0693,3.0271,2.666,3.6151,3.9542,5.1502,7.711,1.2618,3.3673,0.3443,0.2945,2.3233,1.4742,3.7175,1.6317,4.9387,0.2128,1.8848,1.7608,0.5998,3.227,0.4631,2.5801,4.676,1.2376,5.535,0.8191,0.5046,1.1457,4.7976,0.2853,1.42,2.0352,2.3682,3.7715,3.1193,3.4548,3.1646,6.1783,0.4499,1.9125,2.3128,4.6084,0.7377,10.9134,1.3764,4.3336,3.9944,4.2786,1.1924,1.4092,3.362,3.1571,6.8643,3.6342,7.0315,3.8418,5.8092,3.4983,2.1392,1.0942,1.0327,4.3426,1.1905,2.0672,4.7472,4.4394,1.5114,1.6858,1.5252,2.4726,2.6065,1.3145,4.6796,0.073,1.5025,4.4958,0.1396,4.5816,1.2582,2.6597,6.1802,5.5944,3.5017,7.0958,1.1656,2.3225,3.3402,0.6683,3.9236,0.7948,1.1973,0.0364,5.2181,6.0815,0.8115,1.9701,2.0812,3.1706,0.5283,4.4236,6.7669,6.1986,2.2182,1.4153,6.8873,0.5409,3.8963,1.4186,3.3384,4.413,4.1228,7.3514,0.0003,2.6428,5.283,4.7414,0.1215,5.2374,6.6569,1.4653,2.1772,4.3612,5.5167,0.699,2.9911,7.1014,0.7264,3.181,0.8432,3.6096,3.4488,2.006,0.0034,0.0061,4.0615,2.4604,0.8528,3.0811,4.9012,1.8257,2.7063,0.8062,6.2656,1.4235,1.5017,3.4559,2.4943,4.6172,2.2719,4.076,4.1376,2.2833,3.0057,5.9078,1.5608,6.641,0.0268,0.9931,1.5384,4.7533,0.1777,6.4521,5.9915,3.9795,5.6216,3.5369,3.9734,0.3322,6.2858,0.2129,1.2275,9.6231,4.0819,6.1716,5.1731,3.4375,0.7938,4.3084,3.4034,0.0545,5.0672,1.3649,3.4655,0.0422,0.2704,4.4502,0.7715,3.7835,2.0344,5.5107,4.2594,1.3712,6.9579,3.5673,2.4901,6.2985,0.0742,1.1642,2.839,2.1784,3.7283,3.0076,2.2445,4.4525,3.9209,4.1029,1.1342,2.2377,1.0793,4.7628,0.7408,1.6459,3.8819,4.1252,4.2204,0.0022,2.2826,6.0636,0.0451,4.4902,5.1446,3.6372,0.4875,8.1212,1.8744,1.0512,4.6682,0.7303,2.3279,2.8082,7.9209,0.2302,1.696,2.4922,0.9097,2.3552,1.0746,0.2763,0.2565,3.7041,4.575,0.5061,0.5862,1.9762,1.5323,2.384,0.0378,2.8618,3.8218,3.1578,5.8483,3.8788,4.8402,1.4439,1.2778,4.4639,2.141,3.1462,4.5583,1.1649,1.5706,0.3592,3.0738,2.9244,8.8874,0.8268,0.0591,2.7003,0.7611,4.8542,2.2379,5.0123,0.2804,5.6343,1.5644,1.5422,0.0845,0.1721,2.8342,6.2284,2.1005,6.6786,3.7937,2.6671,3.3197,3.618,2.1122,3.8466,2.7082,0.3173,2.5039,6.2263,0.0211,1.91,7.9616,5.5905]}
{"prompt":"Interest in Salvia divinorum has been escalating in the news media , particularly in the United States , where an increasing number of newspaper reports have been published and television news stories broadcast . These","text":"Interest in Salvia divinorum has been escalating in the news media, particularly in the United States, where an increasing number of newspaper reports have been published and television news stories broadcast. These reports have appeared in publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC News, Fox News Channel, and many others. Among the first reports was the Washington Post article, \u201cShould The Government Give Weed to Kids?\u201d in February 2004, which discussed the controversy associated with marijuana in general, and then the controversial use of it for treatment of depression and other diseases. The focus was placed on the marijuana\u2019s potential medical implications. The article was followed by a number of articles in the newspaper reporting on the drug\u2019s use and abuse in the United States.\nIt is important to acknowledge that the initial stories are not necessarily evidence that Salvia divinorum is being used as a recreational drug. They instead suggest a pattern of use of Salvia divinorum that involves the use of the cannabis-like plant to facilitate the use of psychedelic medicines that have not yet been regulated in the United States. In essence, the stories appear to support research that has been conducted to determine what effect smoking Salvia divinorum might have on the effects of marijuana smoke, rather than simply supporting studies that have been conducted on the effects of Salvia divinorum. The first published reports focusing on Salvia divinorum and its psychedelic effects that have been approved by a peer reviewed journal originated in California, which is a pioneer in research on Salvia divinorum.\nIn general, researchers have been divided about where to draw the line between the use of Salvia divinorum and the use of hallucinogenic drugs derived from psychedelic plants. They have argued that Salvia divinorum should be categorized as a hallucinogenic with no medical benefits, rather than being treated as a medicine. It is likely that further scientific research and continued discussions among consumers and researchers will define the appropriate treatment for Salvia divinorum and any other hallucinogenic drug. Even if Salvia divinorum is treated as a hallucinogen with no medical value, there still may be health benefits that could be derived from the plant.\nAs far as recreational use is concerned, one study examined the effects of Salvia divinorum on recreational cannabis smokers. Recreational cannabis smokers inhaled an extract of Salvia divinorum obtained from an Australian manufacturer of the extract. They reported that their respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebral systems all felt significantly stimulated after consumption of the Salvia extract. Another study examined the effects of Salvia divinorum on the subjective experience produced by recreational cannabis use for \u201ccrack.\u201d The subjects rated the severity of symptoms in the following categories after smoking cannabis with or without a Salvia divinorum extract: anxiety, craving, tremor, irritability, sweating, and heart racing. The combination of salvia and cannabis smoking was associated with a more intense subjective experience.\nSalvia divinorum, like Cannabis d.o.c., also produces a \u201chead- or high\u201d effect, and that is likely to last several hours after the psychedelic effect has worn off. As with Cannabis d.o.c., the person will feel energetic and will report subjective experiences that include feelings of euphoria, creativity, enhanced social ability, and enhanced mental sharpness.","token_len":689,"entropy":[3.9968,9.5353,4.6363,4.255,0.0972,0.0073,4.8415,0.8804,12.3381,2.0462,1.9719,6.4109,5.8603,2.5995,3.1149,1.3739,1.022,2.3374,0.0508,1.3745,2.1723,4.9168,3.1924,0.113,0.0277,6.7937,2.8158,1.797,2.5453,2.8973,4.3227,7.2037,2.3692,3.4608,6.8048,1.805,4.3936,0.8864,1.487,5.6493,1.0161,4.5626,0.7787,0.0151,1.6313,0.7744,0.0603,0.0329,0.3235,1.1292,1.2067,0.0563,0.1341,5.3533,0.5726,0.1978,3.3198,0.1285,2.5617,0.3139,1.315,3.2412,1.2151,0.2111,5.9841,1.1318,4.6775,1.9256,3.9749,2.0454,4.1483,0.0983,1.9841,2.1707,12.8279,7.0118,12.3755,4.408,4.9849,4.7475,7.8965,0.6075,4.2912,1.6047,1.2659,8.261,4.3399,3.8048,4.4533,1.3007,1.0688,4.5201,0.8424,5.3927,6.2118,0.0049,2.7031,3.4581,3.3164,1.9242,0.8659,6.0728,2.8353,5.4886,3.7978,0.0791,3.5453,2.7529,5.5457,0.664,4.4723,1.3481,2.2331,4.2111,0.3772,1.6182,7.4549,2.6586,3.5974,0.2095,1.011,5.0534,13.6467,6.6252,2.6513,3.2018,3.3786,5.4898,1.8652,1.7508,1.2201,2.1414,3.3111,0.3781,1.2449,2.7054,0.008,0.9881,1.7507,0.8329,4.7426,7.003,0.766,0.8104,4.5075,1.0535,0.9713,0.126,2.6494,1.7555,2.706,1.8688,1.996,0.6736,0.0046,0.9591,2.769,11.1518,1.2146,1.9157,0.0741,5.1432,0.2695,1.4348,5.751,4.9009,3.5148,1.7065,2.3128,6.8728,2.7321,6.4946,0.0014,0.0862,0.0031,0.0006,0.5875,4.6299,0.6301,1.6505,0.4361,4.7044,0.2855,0.7544,3.8214,6.5378,3.3244,2.9518,7.2583,0.2879,1.7886,2.3177,2.0065,0.0005,0.124,0.0016,0.0007,2.1017,5.6135,2.3838,1.1398,0.0779,2.981,5.2103,4.5126,2.3246,1.6454,2.8517,4.912,1.5421,2.211,0.0769,7.2371,4.7427,3.8647,2.3918,2.5548,1.9874,0.2267,6.1349,2.2452,0.3413,0.2025,0.0026,0.216,2.7579,5.6633,0.0421,1.0479,4.2165,4.6088,0.1324,3.8276,6.5634,0.9016,1.7731,1.4863,1.0157,2.4175,2.2405,3.4555,3.6043,6.0262,1.7375,0.0028,0.0509,0.0017,0.0005,2.1547,0.0134,0.191,1.1047,3.6456,0.0509,1.7503,8.6888,2.1143,4.2433,0.0035,3.7862,4.9732,3.4668,0.6693,1.3774,1.3336,0.6879,2.2962,1.2837,1.0308,0.0403,2.3687,0.0018,0.038,0.0017,0.0007,1.3543,2.4603,3.3642,4.0322,2.8681,6.9136,0.0956,1.4866,0.0011,0.0059,0.0015,0.0007,3.6887,1.1422,7.1688,0.6913,6.2395,1.4182,0.348,7.0023,1.0448,5.8363,5.6827,1.7229,1.9892,9.2277,1.32,5.9767,1.5669,3.2813,1.5691,2.2818,6.5486,0.656,3.1798,1.1713,3.9843,0.001,0.0066,0.0018,0.0006,0.6413,2.137,2.5443,4.2143,0.0594,4.0402,1.4857,1.9676,7.8193,2.9977,4.7566,1.9722,2.4426,0.0633,0.2453,0.8824,2.167,1.5051,0.0551,0.7193,0.0035,0.0077,0.0023,0.0004,1.1042,1.6292,0.79,0.0315,4.9384,0.0011,1.3603,0.5228,8.984,0.0183,7.3483,1.4291,0.4656,5.7228,1.5036,4.4865,0.1599,2.1313,0.0042,0.0097,0.0019,0.0004,2.7079,0.5355,6.2134,0.3425,0.6316,3.8106,0.003,0.3089,6.762,1.9605,2.2751,3.2407,1.3923,3.7734,0.0317,3.0194,4.4463,0.5365,0.6326,4.6947,1.1601,3.8311,0.5224,4.4473,0.1257,6.9141,4.1465,0.949,4.195,7.1826,5.5121,4.1553,7.9614,1.6045,2.0283,0.7423,6.2103,0.8569,4.2186,3.7948,0.944,1.0457,0.0046,0.0026,0.0023,0.0004,2.2683,5.0804,1.157,2.0574,0.0132,0.1246,1.0512,0.7781,6.2376,1.1881,2.8333,0.0064,0.0037,0.0024,0.0004,0.7539,3.341,0.3531,0.1796,3.5313,0.0023,2.1205,3.3487,0.6639,0.4618,4.4966,0.1967,2.735,4.3603,2.5819,0.2333,5.3374,1.4381,2.1126,2.7084,0.7619,1.9519,0.0265,1.2427,2.5569,0.8585,1.3924,4.035,4.2974,0.0998,5.2949,0.7466,1.5679,0.0001,0.0189,4.6381,4.0709,5.1755,0.8678,1.0246,0.0412,1.7499,0.0037,0.0089,0.0033,0.0006,0.5604,6.2374,3.4685,4.2817,1.0523,7.7193,0.0039,2.4939,1.5062,6.3673,1.3802,4.1042,3.8299,0.4161,0.9246,0.0042,0.0349,0.0025,0.0016,6.9577,0.2571,3.5772,5.2318,6.7245,1.869,2.9795,5.336,1.1612,3.0876,1.6605,1.2923,2.9007,6.2737,4.2056,2.2562,0.196,0.1767,7.6066,4.0228,7.6273,5.5725,3.5633,8.6139,3.3872,5.051,0.5722,1.1001,3.5357,0.0059,7.8007,0.3456,4.6177,0.1213,1.9021,0.4167,0.2561,0.0398,0.7291,0.0088,0.0121,0.0038,0.0009,0.3544,1.7537,3.5039,2.8524,8.508,0.1936,3.4172,0.887,2.9813,5.2675,13.1365,0.7811,11.0335,3.7111,4.021,6.0378,2.49,2.1181,3.8835,4.9118,1.2081,6.6062,0.0844,3.8188,3.4079,1.7989,3.4684,3.0506,6.2916,3.3368,5.4156,3.7224,2.0237,0.0016,3.1298,2.6789,0.0262,0.2608,0.0055,0.0038,0.5887,0.5956,5.3939,0.1838,7.1993,0.0737,5.4208,0.024,0.0459,3.3604,0.0124,0.0415,5.629,0.0514,2.0922,5.8594,7.62,0.1486,1.8517,6.8007,0.0464,2.9197,0.0386,2.6721,0.9953,5.3906,2.218,0.8802,0.0103,1.4124,5.2209,3.1286,3.2646,0.5354,1.7386,1.5244,3.7077,0.005,0.0465,0.0032,0.0007,3.7394,2.4562,5.8981,7.2948,7.0349,2.9462,0.385,1.798,0.3341,4.2491,3.3118,1.8022,12.3679,1.2858,6.4641,3.3303,7.9497,8.6162,7.0549,4.684,3.9718,2.3235,2.5793,4.2162,1.3401,2.6223,0.8227,6.9533,5.071,1.1287,2.3232,2.6986,9.4121,1.7965,1.3228,2.3123,0.0043,0.181,4.0946,2.3662,1.2692,0.497,0.0025,0.0044,0.0024,0.0105,0.0388,1.7253,6.4066,2.897,2.6384,7.0536,0.8886,3.9272,4.4707,6.2449,2.8259,1.6079,3.8602,3.7362,0.0362,0.8858,0.0113,0.453,5.9795,0.0371,7.0609,4.1076,5.8294,0.0625,0.9085,3.9719,3.4855,7.9732,0.0121,0.2627]}
{"prompt":"Traditionally , Ireland is subdivided into four provinces : Connacht ( west ) , Leinster ( east ) , Munster ( south ) , and Ulster ( north ) . In a system that developed","text":"Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces : Connacht ( west ), Leinster ( east ), Munster ( south ), and Ulster ( north ). In a system that developed later, Dublin and County Wicklow were combined into Dublin City. A third system, the system of counties and counties boroughs, is being developed - Dublin City is an example of a counties borough. In each counties, the local people govern themselves and all government services are administered by the counties. The counties are divided into smaller units called parishes; these have become a model for the parish system that is slowly taking hold in the rest of Ireland.\nThe three provinces have their own culture, language and traditions. The provinces have a wide range of history and many interesting landmarks.\nThe most important of these landmarks are the ruins of the old monastic buildings. There are four important monasteries to tour in Ireland :\nA monastery is a kind of university that teaches the basic Christian faith to students. The monks who had founded the monastery lived at a monastery as simple peasants. The monks were trained as priests because they worked as the priests at home. They were trained to be able to read the Bible and to recite the most important parts of the Bible. Their religion was very simple - they lived in communities and taught the Bible at schools. The monastery was called a college because the monks studied the Bible and formed various special centres of learning.\nThe Irish monks who founded the monasteries were very important people in the church in Europe because they helped to spread Christianity. They built monasteries and they encouraged the monks to study religion and learning. By learning, they were able to spread ideas and teach Christians about the Bible. That was a very important step in the spread of Christianity.\nIn Ireland, there were some very important Irish monks. It took many years to build monasteries, but it took them only some years to build some spectacular ruins in Ireland.\nIn Ireland, you will see many ruins of the old monasteries that have been built by the monks over hundreds of years. But you will see less ruins of monasteries built at the end of the 8th century as well - because then the Irish monks worked to bring Christianity back to Ireland. From the time when you start to see these ruins, your trip to Ireland is almost full of cultural experiences. All the monasteries show you Ireland as it was before the monks arrived - some of them also show you Ireland as it is now.\nThe monasteries are almost perfect examples of how the monks lived - one room at a time. You can see how people slept, how they played and all the other small things that you would think would disappear when the monasteries are torn down.\nYou will see churches that were used to teach about the Bible to people. You will see libraries where the monks read books - there are even some of those books here. You will see bathrooms where you can wash your hands. And of course, you will see the buildings where the monks lived - this sometimes still shows you exactly how they lived. A room with what you can imagine - you have to be very patient to imagine. Sometimes, you even have to walk through the doors to get to the different houses.\nMost of the buildings are in ruins - some have been renovated and are still used, but they look terrible - so sad.","token_len":689,"entropy":[5.6964,1.348,0.4064,8.4413,2.5838,12.2234,0.0077,0.1202,2.2092,2.9531,6.9788,5.9756,0.3832,2.2758,10.8578,2.5029,4.0144,0.1592,0.0004,0.0437,0.5341,0.1193,3.9915,0.0019,0.0458,1.6503,0.2355,0.7388,2.0799,0.7572,0.5479,0.1906,2.5425,4.5682,5.7015,2.6145,6.9413,5.7467,0.9006,5.434,2.494,6.0407,5.326,0.0609,1.3097,5.0319,0.6294,3.9693,3.1311,1.5171,4.497,4.8485,5.4555,1.3051,2.4222,6.6558,0.3908,3.6217,2.7973,2.5119,9.6445,0.3547,0.6575,2.785,4.0576,1.026,7.2034,4.0493,1.9316,1.5421,3.9851,2.1401,0.9704,1.7698,7.6101,0.4139,1.3147,2.8012,5.4136,7.4213,3.7392,1.643,3.8377,5.8653,5.9602,4.0493,2.0278,4.7101,5.6404,3.4986,0.4764,1.7573,0.3672,1.1129,4.2219,0.6826,1.6528,3.5516,1.4629,2.3965,0.1652,4.2854,2.8918,1.4116,5.4153,0.4714,5.6583,2.4726,5.1381,6.244,3.4069,4.8774,0.312,1.7242,8.6534,1.2073,4.0506,2.0597,6.8787,3.9707,3.5241,0.7871,1.7714,4.7759,0.0014,1.1801,0.196,1.5999,4.334,5.0848,4.5658,3.2077,1.9187,0.0903,6.7407,1.2415,2.6678,2.5111,2.584,0.9181,1.5712,4.5466,1.6262,1.9272,4.4136,0.771,0.0117,6.6407,1.2028,5.8613,5.4034,6.8129,1.2137,2.9695,1.5714,4.4771,1.425,2.1852,0.293,4.5387,1.8911,0.7358,6.2528,0.1314,0.8799,3.465,5.5246,2.166,2.5891,2.3038,4.036,0.6223,4.4359,4.4441,3.2551,0.4263,0.0001,4.6473,8.9086,1.9949,1.1428,3.0513,3.6154,3.6482,3.2189,2.2104,0.8809,6.0371,0.0048,7.442,2.8216,3.4629,1.6464,4.6437,4.1696,2.7666,3.7754,2.5202,1.2426,1.6985,2.5908,4.3075,6.6133,5.0214,0.7573,0.2996,4.9719,3.4926,2.7372,1.3381,5.514,8.3011,5.9025,1.1894,1.619,1.4918,1.8235,4.4573,2.1769,2.3841,6.1469,0.6395,4.5825,2.1756,4.3055,3.3052,2.8019,5.148,0.4981,2.1984,1.3101,3.3243,1.2929,1.4774,5.2386,0.017,3.4118,2.1235,1.1917,1.0047,1.5627,3.2224,0.9132,6.8719,1.3269,3.642,0.069,0.5269,0.6232,0.5938,4.0591,5.0372,0.5397,3.8469,2.2778,2.4284,0.8836,4.0639,1.032,6.4643,1.8163,5.0235,1.4853,2.8088,3.8423,5.6307,0.5959,1.7382,2.1359,0.9194,3.0926,1.7433,6.9458,1.5304,2.099,1.1041,3.6792,1.9992,0.8117,1.7619,8.1214,6.1012,6.4366,7.5396,1.3664,0.5606,0.7079,1.5546,1.1849,4.8333,5.4131,3.7871,1.4634,0.2077,2.9848,0.807,0.0153,1.362,3.3616,3.6931,2.911,2.1088,0.9432,4.0111,5.004,5.1775,4.5937,0.551,4.1385,1.0895,2.7198,1.9052,1.555,1.3197,4.1612,3.658,0.0137,0.0008,1.4736,4.3841,5.157,1.4453,2.7578,0.2097,2.2603,5.2252,1.4833,5.9317,0.5968,5.8076,4.7242,3.3262,0.7452,1.9032,0.3136,0.0039,3.8019,6.0145,0.9628,4.0449,6.9171,3.8545,0.8373,2.0376,0.6797,5.9753,1.8968,2.3081,1.5566,0.2376,3.6601,0.9215,0.7934,4.3224,0.0188,0.4358,0.7298,0.7271,2.8082,2.3892,0.4096,2.2203,2.2301,3.7137,3.1058,0.934,6.6995,2.953,1.9903,4.4133,4.216,3.672,0.6939,1.8849,1.8997,5.3097,0.016,0.0015,1.966,0.6723,3.0879,2.7134,1.827,4.6423,4.9586,1.2814,0.4022,1.1448,4.0064,8.0337,4.5677,2.8595,1.6978,0.2653,1.5985,2.3518,1.7888,0.2934,4.4286,3.8029,1.8708,2.3864,4.1385,1.5101,1.4288,1.2204,0.6809,0.6358,0.0037,3.3987,2.5533,0.5486,2.4627,2.3519,0.7907,0.8851,3.5304,4.7335,0.0266,0.0207,0.2159,5.161,3.3352,0.3527,2.1895,6.5662,2.6396,1.0315,2.8445,0.0278,0.0016,2.5873,4.5575,1.1504,2.1053,0.027,0.2928,7.0451,0.0516,0.2158,4.0481,3.0953,4.1786,3.4486,5.9681,1.1163,5.4465,1.4162,5.5877,2.8924,4.2318,1.7008,1.984,0.488,0.5169,0.3059,6.6163,1.184,2.7968,3.118,4.4235,4.1506,1.1239,1.3475,2.2863,0.9017,0.709,4.3943,7.3768,1.1249,0.3744,1.7437,4.2787,5.6511,0.3886,5.6328,3.301,0.6107,5.9001,1.1799,3.1389,0.033,0.0009,7.3246,0.7653,7.1713,2.1629,2.8302,0.5962,0.8738,0.9406,5.5876,3.2089,3.3313,5.0074,0.9549,0.6153,6.5018,1.9673,0.1564,2.8121,0.5489,0.4854,1.1728,0.651,0.3096,0.6333,1.7217,2.9627,0.0877,0.0035,1.6412,5.3535,6.0704,2.1463,0.0433,2.3715,1.4987,3.9648,3.1452,4.3642,6.0943,7.0311,2.668,0.266,0.5106,0.7861,2.9776,1.2562,0.955,2.5443,4.3802,6.638,1.5308,1.6054,0.7249,5.287,2.0919,5.0769,0.9214,2.0236,7.6372,1.0932,0.6798,2.6748,2.1411,3.1133,2.1785,7.3205,2.3897,2.9913,2.6499,0.1054,0.0057,3.9789,7.5363,0.1349,0.2496,1.1568,3.2601,0.6238,1.0734,5.2379,2.3754,1.482,4.0385,1.8284,2.6319,4.295,0.8656,1.4479,4.9224,2.3124,1.7467,1.8301,0.3655,0.4288,6.1637,2.1608,2.231,0.565,2.6099,3.6114,3.9733,3.7591,0.7096,3.0826,2.4758,2.8614,2.1795,3.2904,5.6158,1.3881,1.7348,0.1937,0.5167,9.6885,1.137,3.1391,0.4497,2.0214,0.4509,0.6234,1.4218,3.5812,3.4925,0.0036,0.8545,0.7735,0.1312,0.3057,1.7376,3.7385,1.934,0.7102,0.1849,1.144,2.036,4.7038,9.1096,6.1502,3.0579,1.3335,6.921,1.0367,1.1954,0.2787,0.5669,5.8241,5.4729,2.4944,6.3789,1.8474,2.7832,2.9981,3.5552,2.6321,3.5066,1.329,3.3804,1.9005,5.4859,1.406,6.1503,3.1824,6.0672,2.2792,0.8553,4.0492,1.1502,0.1555,2.8342,2.0557,1.0273,3.2368,1.8679,1.4276,1.6239,0.7412,6.5948,3.7785,0.9181,0.7629,4.7064,0.4029,0.3299,1.6309,1.9436,3.386,2.9671,1.7253,2.5254,2.2292,1.3055,4.5734,2.0021,4.0849,1.5311,3.8775,3.294,0.7049,2.1271,3.9689,5.7706,2.4459,4.0521,8.5373,1.0733]}

The city has since adopted the council form of government. It also maintains one of Central Texas's smallest land areas. The Houston-Galveston area was once considered to be one of the most dangerous areas of the world for navigation because of the rivers and lakes in the area. In recent years, the city has begun to modernize its ports. By 1990, Galveston was the only major port in Texas that had a ship -building yard. The city has one of the largest seaports in Texas and serves as an important seaport for the U.S. Marine Corp. The port of Galveston continues to be a busy port, offering many options for local residents and travelers.\nThe Houston and Galveston area contains some of the most recognizable landmarks in the U.S. The Houston Museum District was created in the early 1900's when many of Houston's finest arts and cultural institutions such as the Texas Institute of Music, the Texas Scottish Rite Museum, and the Houston Museum of Natural Science moved to their permanent locations at the present location. The first public library in Texas was built as part of the Galveston Institute of Fine Arts in 1902, but moved to the present location in 1907. Galveston is also home to several well-known private museum institutions such as the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Texas State Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Dallas. The Houston Museum District is one of the most famous shopping districts in Texas and contains many retail establishments including boutiques, hotels, and restaurants. The area is the location of the Houston Convention Center, one of the leading convention centers in the United States. The Houston Convention Center holds a growing list of major international events and is the location of the American Airlines Center for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association.\nThe Houston -Galveston area was historically one of the first areas of the U.S to become an urban center and an important industrial area. Today, it remains the most economically successful area of the state and has long been in the top percent of every major economic index. The local economy is based in the petroleum industry, with major petroleum companies such as Gulfwide Petroleum Corporation and the Houston Ship Channel Corporation both headquartered in the area.\nGalveston, Texas, has a long history of tourism. It was an important port to the West Indies in the early 1600's and remained so until the late 1800's. During the early 1900's, Galveston took a prominent role in the development of the Gulf Shore, a trend that continued into the twentieth century with the development of the island and beach area known today as Orange Beach. Today, more than four million people visit the area each year, primarily between the months of July and December.\nA good rule of thumb is to check with the city of Galveston before visiting the area. All visitors are required to register their vehicle when they enter Texas and must carry a photo identification card.

{"prompt":"The sebaceous glands are found throughout all areas of the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet . There are two types of sebaceous gland , those connected to hair","text":"The sebaceous glands are found throughout all areas of the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are two types of sebaceous gland, those connected to hair follicles and those that are not. The hair follicle sebaceous gland secretes the oil that coats hair, but it also surrounds the hair follicle and creates an oil barrier to keep the hair follicle moist.\nThe non-hair follicle sebaceous glands are present in the skin that has little to no hair. These glands are found in the facial skin, under the eyelids, and on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the genital tract. They are responsible for releasing an oily substance that lubricates the skin and mucous membranes.\nThe oil glands and oil canals in the human body are very sensitive to cold. When you are cold, the oil in the skin becomes hard and stiff, and the oil canals stop conducting the oil to the skin surface. Instead, the oil runs straight from one oil canal to the next to stay warm.\nIf your child has eczema, it can be a result of an allergy to some of the food and chemicals that are present in the environment, in the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and the cleaning detergents used in the homes of many people.\nAllergy symptoms usually include a watery discharge from the nose called a nasal runny or watery discharge, itching, redness, and in some cases, a rash. Many people with eczema also have a tendency to react to the chemicals and medicines used in hospitals, clinics, and health care facilities. When this happens, the symptoms that occur immediately after entering a hospital or medical facility are generally not serious, but some people can develop a severe allergic reaction that can be life threatening or even fatal.\n( I also have a daughter with ADHD. Her doctor put a special pill in her water to help her lose weight. She was in trouble for eating some of her pills. )\nIf you are a parent of a child with eczema, your child probably suffers from itching, redness, cracking, and bleeding at least one to three times a week. Often, the rash comes and goes. Sometimes, the condition gets severe.\nMy daughter and I have a lot of trouble with the itching, redness, and cracking. We always have to be careful not to burn the skin with the heat and hot running water that we use to wash the rash often. If a hot running water causes the rash to get worse, it is very painful and uncomfortable for us.\nThe skin can become itchy very easily and it does not have to be caused by anything that is directly harmful. In fact, you can have a mild skin rash by touching some oily substance or by rubbing an itching substance on your skin.\nThe redness that causes the itching sometimes becomes quite severe and can hurt a lot. This severe redness of the skin in eczema can be a result of a cold exposure that triggers the sweating glands in the skin to produce more oil than they normally do.\nThe itching that causes the redness is mainly made up of proteins. These proteins can make people itch because they act as natural allergens. While some of these proteins are naturally occurring, others are produced by insects and animals, often when they are dead.","token_len":690,"entropy":[9.262,6.0179,0.2964,2.6198,1.6787,3.8596,3.8601,4.7309,5.2999,0.196,0.371,5.5081,4.4735,0.5884,4.92,2.167,0.2229,0.5285,1.1636,5.7436,0.0013,0.236,0.4403,0.2057,0.4268,4.4178,0.46,2.4174,1.4729,0.0901,0.4549,0.0544,0.0025,3.979,2.4108,3.97,6.8823,0.7927,6.3178,0.9083,0.0373,0.4433,1.0227,2.5558,1.0901,3.6076,0.8051,1.036,2.8058,0.0658,1.4737,3.6236,0.1448,0.0092,0.5231,7.298,0.1461,2.802,4.1696,1.8892,4.5363,3.4825,2.5771,3.1346,1.2726,2.1226,5.9756,0.4727,2.3279,0.2331,0.4629,2.3796,4.6705,2.6548,2.4503,3.4558,2.9203,1.9828,1.0221,0.6563,1.7391,0.4615,4.0778,0.5298,2.053,8.4148,7.0686,0.1593,3.7773,0.6697,0.0778,0.0775,0.0047,0.001,2.9041,1.0791,4.5173,0.6429,1.4357,2.5795,4.6619,3.4724,5.9354,1.5807,0.0427,2.345,1.6475,3.3064,0.1611,1.1478,2.6844,0.8832,0.6129,6.0066,2.6434,0.9793,3.9164,0.1869,3.4078,0.2026,0.3447,1.4808,1.632,0.1496,6.6425,0.4148,0.1145,1.0141,0.0898,7.0375,0.2526,2.5267,2.3096,5.0454,2.7514,0.2171,1.7123,0.8046,4.493,0.0078,6.4076,4.2856,1.7398,1.9875,1.7584,5.7991,0.0131,0.3166,0.4883,1.2047,6.5145,0.1173,0.059,0.6417,1.2775,1.2376,4.3148,1.7169,3.9997,3.6164,6.1142,9.1615,2.5578,0.2654,4.6342,0.387,0.7311,3.4617,1.0064,0.3255,5.7249,1.4945,3.1681,3.5552,2.091,2.2994,0.6411,1.1266,2.5592,3.8753,0.6929,1.7898,3.194,3.1327,0.6648,4.8171,1.5982,1.2906,1.5377,3.0264,2.3072,5.0395,5.1667,8.904,2.3141,3.0388,2.7881,0.4208,0.5269,5.8582,0.3739,6.6929,0.3968,0.6427,2.0265,7.6486,5.3705,3.167,4.4525,4.2869,8.8273,0.1894,0.6675,0.7315,5.7488,5.775,3.0013,0.8931,1.4225,3.4813,2.7909,6.1671,1.5077,5.6976,0.0067,0.0015,0.5222,2.6875,2.2573,0.6882,2.3025,4.2297,0.0149,2.972,2.714,0.6481,4.4037,0.9656,0.1809,5.1209,2.6056,4.1984,1.5685,1.2785,1.7714,0.1854,0.6823,3.0455,2.6574,5.4101,0.6692,1.4619,4.2982,0.3732,0.2727,4.1246,4.6179,0.222,0.1152,0.1512,1.4983,1.1558,6.6162,6.3838,1.2998,0.0,2.4841,1.4945,0.8894,4.549,3.5115,5.3997,1.9218,0.2108,1.2506,5.5578,0.4981,4.2287,3.52,3.607,2.4768,7.8427,0.0403,3.7806,2.092,0.2601,3.6112,8.2753,1.6991,4.6808,7.0919,2.5179,3.416,4.8372,0.046,0.8338,1.7607,6.9266,0.8464,2.719,0.2029,0.4821,1.8713,6.6983,0.1944,0.1102,0.695,2.354,2.0412,0.4922,5.0197,0.9078,1.3719,0.1605,0.0014,0.006,2.3648,0.6191,1.7883,5.2849,0.0709,6.845,0.7368,2.3035,3.6672,2.6132,5.8413,2.8439,0.6245,6.4875,1.4263,4.5915,0.0638,0.2997,4.8774,0.6159,0.5159,0.393,4.3733,2.4312,0.5779,0.0914,1.2087,2.4903,5.1108,2.5813,5.2193,1.4035,6.7378,1.7282,0.3893,1.6388,4.1125,0.6319,1.4347,5.3862,3.911,3.7555,1.886,0.6316,3.9652,0.8449,3.0466,1.1031,1.9303,3.9316,1.5368,0.0279,2.6225,1.0849,2.0058,1.2067,0.7516,3.635,1.0695,0.706,0.072,0.4546,6.975,9.3959,4.5194,1.6687,1.4707,5.1579,1.6005,9.2361,2.3323,2.7292,3.5067,5.504,2.5806,4.484,6.2085,1.6809,0.5402,6.1036,3.9748,1.8022,0.4915,6.0723,0.8603,0.8373,1.3428,2.0731,4.215,4.8737,1.3308,3.8976,4.8406,1.4073,2.2101,7.0241,1.6971,6.0343,0.2838,3.4524,0.8275,1.669,2.9937,2.0947,1.9706,0.364,0.1506,0.2748,1.5888,0.0043,0.0008,0.4133,3.3368,0.6502,5.0177,5.1446,0.1235,8.5281,0.711,0.7991,0.0126,0.0702,10.3375,0.5361,1.5702,5.1046,4.0822,3.5899,3.2035,2.0864,1.4895,0.0946,0.5753,1.0598,0.3597,5.7458,0.7131,1.7484,3.791,4.818,3.9654,0.4132,4.1951,3.4377,0.9362,1.0224,4.8041,4.0876,5.8595,2.3351,2.2544,5.4295,0.7474,3.4144,0.133,1.4714,2.414,2.8605,0.0695,3.4151,1.7617,2.3709,2.472,1.5203,0.6268,0.0036,0.0708,0.179,4.954,1.7901,1.6176,4.482,1.6296,1.0521,3.4758,1.165,1.7511,0.0028,5.3182,1.5544,0.8724,2.5218,2.2575,5.3789,3.356,3.9052,7.1623,0.3011,2.5986,1.3959,0.8339,1.4414,1.6352,1.4457,5.4372,7.7036,0.2589,3.375,4.2061,4.242,2.3811,0.1217,5.1573,1.0364,0.7844,0.4224,2.3611,1.1501,0.2659,1.5748,1.2138,2.9302,5.1316,1.3684,5.1135,2.1572,1.6374,0.9394,1.4767,2.4934,2.5451,3.1183,2.223,9.03,0.0001,5.5736,2.9578,2.2453,2.6131,5.0031,0.5018,3.746,1.2729,0.2769,5.5986,0.0493,3.1309,2.1428,1.6877,6.232,3.8722,1.1074,3.6991,0.8315,0.0124,4.0956,0.7305,2.679,1.487,4.042,2.7502,1.1684,4.0677,4.4281,4.4973,6.3138,2.8284,2.2454,3.2507,2.8322,5.2323,8.9352,3.8669,1.4407,1.4923,0.8635,0.544,1.2371,2.2629,6.5034,0.2187,3.9216,5.3124,1.3642,2.4439,5.0382,3.5428,4.0914,1.6043,1.8784,2.2264,7.3077,3.1586,1.562,0.9381,3.0612,7.2597,1.9657,0.0103,6.1531,0.3341,0.1083,6.3976,3.2233,0.0023,0.0029,1.206,1.1824,2.809,3.1363,0.0118,1.8929,4.6707,5.5304,3.4932,5.6519,1.0335,5.4281,4.2679,1.2991,0.3019,1.1871,1.3952,2.0397,2.2425,2.5304,3.1929,1.2279,2.1997,1.4028,0.2537,1.3101,1.7183,4.2321,3.5474,0.981,0.4441,1.4734,0.008,1.7775,5.3656,6.3532,1.2226,0.0465,5.8537,2.689,1.4698,0.2695,2.2981,3.4038,4.9582,2.9398,3.5766,0.4515,5.812,1.1205,4.7765,5.2687,0.0003,0.7629,5.6292,2.4418,1.2145,0.8871,0.2367,1.1715,3.8297,3.4562,0.6666,1.5696,0.6919,3.0672,0.4751,5.4252,1.6647,4.1304,2.1473,5.2142,4.2333,1.349,0.8072,7.7201,0.5788]}

{"prompt":"The ancient words for antimony mostly have , as their chief meaning , kohl , the sulfide of antimony . The Egyptians called antimony < unk > ; in hieroglyphs , the vowels are uncertain","text":"The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony. The Egyptians called antimony < unk > ; in hieroglyphs, the vowels are uncertain, and may well represent a plural, but the syllables < unk > are unknown ; therefore the most natural meaning of the word is a kohl : the Assyrians ( i.e., the Babylonians ) call it < *knhn-mn >, *knhn meaning gilding, and it evidently signifies a spice of gilding, or as much of the stuff as is capable of being made to assume the appearance of gilding by the addition of certain other ingredients ; the Arabs call it < *r nmi >, the verb being apparently to burn, which is a common Arabic verb, used in the English sense of to singe or burn.\nThe following translation of a short passage in a manuscript volume, which was found in the Vatican library, will serve to explain its ancient uses, and to show that the word kohl may be applied to it in the following senses.\nFrom a number of these manuscripts I have lately drawn the following interesting notice on \" Antimony As A Drug in An Egyptian Manuscript.\n\" The passage in question ( the Egyptian title of which is a word meaning oil ), is contained ( on the flyleaf ) in a MS.\nof the Book of the Dead.\nIt runs as follows : \" I wrote for thee this, that thou shouldest not go and dwell by the water side, nor come near the sea shore, nor touch a person for a while, the body of thy mother, nor that of thy father until the dead body had been put away by fire ; nor a man of thy kinsfolk, nor a person who is a stranger to thee who is dead ; and it became a kohl for thee when thou didst enter into thy father's grave \" Now the fact seems to me that none of these things could have been done by the action of antimony if it had been, as we know it to be, the metallic sulphide, for fire would have destroyed the sulphide, but would certainly not have destroyed the body of a man.\nThere appear to have been various kinds of potions or medicated liquids used for certain purposes ; some of them were liquid, or diluted in water ; others, mixed into the earth, were applied in the form of an earthy preparation, and others in the form of an injection.\nNow it is evident that all these methods of applying antimony to the body would be absolutely unscientific, for it was only when the body had been thoroughly decayed that it could be dug up and the sulphide applied.\nI am sorry to be compelled to refer the reader to the above-mentioned notice, but it must be the better to show how far our knowledge of antimonian treatment of human and animal bodies at their time of decay is carried.\nIn conclusion I beg to add that the most probable meaning

{"prompt":"In 2008 , Miles and Leah develop feelings for one another . Nicodemou who plays Leah said her character becomes `` freaked out `` when she realises they share a connection . At this point","text":"In 2008, Miles and Leah develop feelings for one another. Nicodemou who plays Leah said her character becomes `` freaked out `` when she realises they share a connection. At this point, however, Leah starts dating a successful doctor who may be a threat to Miles. Meanwhile, Miles is getting less and less support from his wife, who is starting to worry that he will get into trouble. As Miles and Leah begin to get closer, their connection becomes more obvious and Nicodemou felt it important to address her character. `` You see that they're falling in love with each other, but there's a lot of danger and she becomes frightened at what might happen to her. '', Nicodemou said. She and Miles'feelings come into conflict, as the woman becomes frightened of her feelings for her husband by seeing what happens to him.\nBut while the connection between Miles and Leah has become obvious, there's still another problem for the couple. Miles'mother, played by actress Mavis Staples ( who co-wrote and co-starred in the film ), believes her son to be involved with Leah's family and is prepared to leave Miles if she can prove he is not in love with her. In an attempt to protect his son, Leah takes advantage of the situation and says the truth : she and Jimmy are in a relationship, but the boy was only an innocent bystander. Leah then gets the mother to agree to keep an eye on the boy and Miles, who has been trying to help Leah put the pieces of her life back together, takes matters into his own hands. He gets Leah to agree to talk to the mother and they find that the mother is in fact right - Jimmy is the real threat to Miles. When Jimmy arrives, however, he attacks Miles and the two are fighting when he falls down a flight of stairs, resulting in Leah stepping in. She is knocked out and Jimmy leaves, but while he's about to leave, he says a few harsh words about Leah and her relationship with Miles. Leah is furious, but is unwilling to leave her life down. The two make up and then a few weeks later, Leah confides in a friend that she and Miles are in fact dating. She reveals that the doctor was a threat to Miles, but she also had feelings for him as well, which he had not foreseen. The storyline ends with a happy ending for the couple as they live together happy ever after.\nThe actress who played Leah was keen to get into the character and felt it essential that Nicodemou understood her relationship with her son and the fact that she had feelings for her boss. `` It was pretty obvious, from the beginning, that she was an incredibly strong character with a very special, unconventional way of dealing with her problems,'' Nicodemou revealed. She also had a strong connection to her parents, who were in love and had a difficult relationship. `We all saw this and got it, but it was great to work with a director who had a natural instinct for what was going on with the relationship between her and her mother.

{"prompt":"U @ - @ 111 took part in one wolfpack , namely . West ( 13 May - 5 June 1941 ) = = Summary of raiding history = = = Waxy ( horse )","text":"U @ - @ 111 took part in one wolfpack, namely. West ( 13 May - 5 June 1941 ) = = Summary of raiding history = = = Waxy ( horse ) was taken during the war, the reason is because the horse was too fat to be useful for the pack. The packs were named after people that had been killed or wounded and this is the only place that it is recorded. In the old order the packs had a leader and this leader was selected either by the other wolves themselves or by the pack leaders and not by the pack owner. The leaders were usually the strongest wolf in the pack and the main target for attacks. = = = The packs that had the leaders named by the owner = = = There is a great difference in the history of the packs as there are some that were named after people that had died and some that were named after people that had been wounded. In 1939 one of the owners decided to name the pack after some members of his own family. This was Wolf Pack 2 of William West ( 13 May - 5 June 1941 ) and there were twelve wolves that were in this pack. It is reported that this pack was made up of wolves that were being kept at West's farm at the time. Wolves are naturally aggressive and with 12 members it is understandable why this pack was so aggressive, but it is not clear as to the reason why they were only kept at West's farm. They were later sold to the American Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York, but there is no more information about which pack they went to. In 1960 two wolves named after people that had died were put to sleep, there are no other details about these wolves. In 1970 the pack that had two wolves named after people having been wounded was named after these two wolves, Wray and Nasty. The reason for the name was that the owner wanted to remember his friend who was killed in 1944 and wanted to name the pack after him. The pack had fourteen wolves in it. In 1977 another wolfpack was named after a wolf that had died from disease, it is named after Wolf Pack 5 of James Wray and Nasty. In this pack the number of wolves was six and there is great difference in size, where Wray and Nasty are big wolves. It is also possible that the wolf named Wolf Pack 6 of James Wray died in September 1977, so the pack has eight members at sometime prior to this time. = = = The packs that had the leaders selected by the packs = = = In 1971 Wolf Pack 2 of William West was named after a horse that was taken during this pack, Waxy. In 1976 Wolf Pack 5 of James Wray and Nasty was named after a wolf that was taken during this pack, the reason it was named after a wolf that had been killed is because the wolf had been killed in 1944 and was named Wolf Pack 3 of James Wray and Nasty, it is also possible that it was named Wolf Pack 6 of James Wray and Nasty. In 1979 Wolf Pack 6 of James Wray and Nasty was renamed the Pack of the Dead, this was done by the owner of the pack as it had been named Wolf Pack 6 of James Wray and Nasty. In 1984 another wolfpack that had a wolf named after a dead person was named after a wolf by the name of Wolf Pack 6 of James Wray and Nasty.","token_len":695,"entropy":[8.876,5.9735,7.3587,9.7573,12.2169,5.3763,0.1404,5.0495,13.0181,4.4496,4.2722,8.6637,4.0662,8.875,6.1922,10.3137,8.7553,4.7743,3.9279,0.8106,6.6264,2.3707,6.2627,7.0296,10.8102,1.3347,10.236,6.2012,5.6972,2.8625,2.4547,5.425,11.3813,3.6374,10.7473,1.6362,4.7235,4.4224,5.1664,1.108,3.0419,2.4385,3.938,6.0953,3.3208,4.1846,2.1678,2.9886,0.9843,3.8486,4.0131,0.9122,2.3851,4.5042,1.5734,2.8525,5.1087,0.8964,2.4645,7.2766,1.1148,6.1276,1.3992,5.9202,3.6501,1.9487,1.5852,1.7279,2.7568,2.2369,4.1614,4.8337,2.4311,2.3954,3.3544,3.7654,2.7184,4.5508,1.0365,4.6049,1.5601,3.7685,1.7413,5.7555,8.0675,2.455,5.3752,2.9818,2.2477,5.4041,2.031,3.9746,1.7921,0.8573,6.4654,6.9476,0.8706,1.5619,5.0444,3.4581,6.7776,0.2378,0.606,1.2501,1.6034,2.8066,3.8682,4.9052,0.6689,0.8683,0.9528,6.4376,0.346,1.69,4.7469,0.9853,3.4204,3.0127,5.581,3.6566,3.4504,0.1954,0.4063,1.0382,2.0811,6.1271,5.0022,2.1039,3.2985,1.4755,5.089,0.3586,2.7904,2.3709,5.3888,4.4892,3.0462,2.5292,5.6048,5.5537,3.5566,0.6079,5.2386,6.9169,0.1876,0.3194,5.0428,2.5074,1.5391,3.9214,2.1245,1.2667,1.0414,4.5021,0.2463,1.1554,3.9074,3.6223,2.9168,1.3908,3.1976,2.2179,1.544,3.2182,0.9063,2.0457,1.1106,0.6801,1.5272,2.5376,1.2698,0.4713,0.5668,0.5988,0.1869,1.438,0.243,0.5948,1.4257,1.2793,0.5295,3.0068,6.1732,4.763,1.6939,0.3271,5.5899,5.0159,0.3965,2.0094,0.9126,0.9896,1.5401,4.7006,5.9064,0.0872,1.4048,2.4832,1.2355,1.2267,2.5483,1.5048,10.35,2.8344,4.677,5.434,8.9787,5.3395,2.19,2.5457,0.2177,0.3344,0.4286,0.0121,0.0593,0.3845,3.9046,4.0842,1.2215,6.789,1.4545,2.6476,0.9436,4.0341,2.7737,0.2871,0.8566,3.6653,0.94,4.863,0.1904,3.1218,1.5877,0.9589,5.1149,0.1793,0.1935,4.1812,1.4725,1.0504,6.2902,4.0027,3.1026,6.6815,1.14,1.8595,3.9403,1.7177,0.3553,1.0799,5.6782,2.5357,7.1925,2.864,0.9899,6.4383,8.4766,3.9916,2.5967,0.8869,7.0744,1.5257,2.5167,1.1407,0.8046,3.2802,3.8305,3.7885,2.0799,1.8245,0.764,1.808,1.4563,4.7761,0.4891,2.9424,2.4732,1.4496,2.594,0.7797,6.8862,4.0507,0.7126,0.572,0.0632,0.0312,0.6492,4.2343,0.6674,5.2815,4.3574,1.0541,1.5351,4.2816,5.4871,1.1227,1.8566,3.8119,0.1234,0.0175,0.0003,0.0143,0.0842,2.9323,3.452,0.2317,2.6584,2.5876,3.1149,0.7975,0.2456,7.1338,0.7006,1.7147,5.1492,3.8885,2.0231,5.3236,0.5671,0.4632,3.3239,7.1892,4.3022,1.838,3.6479,3.6348,3.9517,1.2334,0.253,0.8479,1.3898,4.4428,2.2552,4.2929,3.6265,5.6725,1.5798,1.3069,3.343,2.7132,0.9119,3.413,1.1152,0.9949,2.552,3.296,1.9995,2.8374,3.8755,1.2093,4.7104,0.652,0.0393,0.4572,0.6802,9.1634,2.7484,2.6606,0.9236,3.268,0.9585,6.156,1.7881,0.7562,1.8838,6.7128,7.9434,1.0618,5.4808,4.6054,0.9071,2.028,4.801,0.8349,1.5356,0.7934,2.9684,1.2352,1.4427,5.1351,2.3439,0.6877,5.8807,3.6153,5.6811,2.1745,1.6519,0.6823,1.8452,5.9615,1.769,3.9403,0.4617,3.9277,1.1528,0.5633,0.4837,0.8719,0.4409,1.7733,2.4081,3.106,8.2424,1.016,3.6899,1.6465,2.0351,2.4719,4.0781,4.3197,0.6516,14.8428,1.4659,0.2281,0.2731,1.2855,3.2206,1.0721,0.6465,1.4651,3.5747,4.6367,2.1877,2.0783,0.7507,7.4574,0.5138,5.1916,1.5163,3.3617,0.811,3.8245,2.92,1.7653,2.2227,2.1935,0.0147,0.5084,2.2273,4.8008,0.9482,1.5271,5.7384,0.6573,0.4633,0.9647,4.1764,1.453,3.0745,2.9959,8.0607,3.6121,0.6842,5.1109,3.1318,6.5696,4.6652,0.111,1.5248,0.1159,0.0005,1.8753,5.7645,2.1877,1.5597,3.0986,0.3058,2.0773,2.4218,0.2007,1.1155,1.9214,4.5375,3.297,0.3909,2.0145,0.8332,1.3208,0.3341,0.0085,2.8858,2.1597,5.9587,3.2946,1.8852,3.7984,1.847,2.75,3.5069,3.6987,3.0891,4.5276,11.2783,5.7261,0.0249,1.9001,0.8543,0.2818,2.7121,0.0424,0.6832,1.4094,3.9972,0.2226,0.2651,0.4455,1.1764,8.2082,0.1104,0.084,6.1409,2.6384,0.0142,0.4136,2.8576,5.955,3.0721,0.4402,2.1167,0.3911,0.723,0.2357,1.7251,1.3703,0.2008,1.1904,6.6023,1.2501,1.8009,3.3923,1.6365,5.6952,6.8755,1.9743,4.038,5.6097,1.9299,2.077,3.7746,1.8695,0.0713,2.6202,0.1276,0.7455,0.1248,0.0135,2.3338,0.0876,0.0005,1.1802,0.0765,0.0331,0.4589,1.1864,0.3112,1.4161,1.0415,0.898,0.3911,0.0973,1.4297,3.2382,0.5803,6.2563,1.1644,0.3586,0.5342,2.0267,1.157,1.8026,1.2492,1.918,0.7105,3.6886,0.8259,1.0297,1.8001,2.0463,0.9856,1.801,2.2976,2.7839,1.0821,3.2351,3.7341,3.3222,0.0643,3.1449,0.2288,0.648,0.0419,0.0059,0.5808,0.0773,0.0003,2.8368,2.5787,0.3438,1.5883,0.1251,0.2786,3.3569,0.4262,1.822,2.0826,0.0333,0.944,0.3767,0.5318,0.0157,0.0044,0.5478,0.1832,0.0003,0.6266,1.6066,2.9205,0.8964,0.0328,1.6437,0.0961,0.2663,0.0158,0.0045,0.4533,0.0389,0.0003,0.2644,4.3839,3.9162,3.3022,1.2624,2.1233,4.4223,2.0397,2.7921,1.6346,4.3554,2.458,1.5141,1.9047,1.1646,0.8291,1.2257,3.7449,2.8355,2.4463,0.8526,1.3143,3.1693,0.0542,1.6001,0.3062,0.3227,0.0227,0.004,0.3956,0.0632,0.0004,0.5918,1.4211,3.0572,5.6369,0.8595,4.4411,4.4372,0.4501,2.8373,1.7857,0.0418,1.2718,0.6424,4.8434,2.0039,0.309,0.1323,0.6485,1.2335,0.966,8.3541,0.7797,4.2761,0.2611,1.0677,0.1299,1.7139,0.1209,0.183,0.0195,0.0035,0.2783,0.0469,0.0002,0.277]}
{"prompt":"There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse , with some notable historians claiming a size of 17 to 18 hands ( 68 to 72 inches , 173 to 183","text":"There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse, with some notable historians claiming a size of 17 to 18 hands ( 68 to 72 inches, 173 to 183 cms ) and other historians claiming a size somewhat smaller at 16 to 17 hands, 72 to 77 inches, 161 to 168 cms ).\nSadly there is no evidence for the size of the war horse during the Roman empire.\nWar elephants ( equites ) are mentioned in the texts only a single time, in The Consulship of Titus Lentulus Macer and Caius Metellus Pius, which indicates a long delay between their first appearance in the Roman army and our knowledge of them.\nAt Rome we know of war elephants in the reign of the emperors Domitian and Trajan.\nIt is possible that there was an earlier mention of Roman war elephants in the Punic Wars ( -160 to -125 BC ), but no other extant evidence exists.\nThe first written mention of an actual fighting elephant is in the year 115 BC ; it is known from the work of Dio Cassius as \" elephantis \" ( meaning \" elephant \" ).\nIts size is not given, but it is thought by some modern historians to have been a war elephant.\nIn any case it is clear that the Roman army included a considerable number of war elephants - a fact made evident to the legionarian soldiers of Julius Caesar by the elephant that tried to kill one of the Romans on that battlefield in 63 BC.\nIt was one of the largest elephants in the Roman army and the only one in the western half of the Empire reported to have been wrecked by soldiers.\nIt is also clear that Roman armoured cavalry mounted on war elephants in later eras, as the Roman legions were part of the allied Greek army during the wars between Alexander the Great and Xerxes.\nOne of the most famous examples of this is the battle of Gaugamela in -497 BC, where the Persian army was destroyed by Roman armoured cavalry.\nAlthough the earliest source to record the presence of infantry mounted on war elephants is Diodorus Siculus, no other extant source, such as Ptolemy, Pliny, Aratus or Herodotus, gives any indication of it.\nIt seems likely, therefore, that in earlier periods the infantry of Roman armies served only on horseback.\nIn fact it is interesting to speculate as to the nature of the relation between the infantry mounted on war elephants described by Diodorus Siculus and the armour horse of Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalia.\nWith the fall of the Roman empire and the beginning of the barbarian tribes, it is highly unlikely that the Roman army would have retained such a large proportion of war elephants.\nIn general this seems to have been the fate of the war elephant throughout the Dark Ages, though there is some evidence that the use of war elephants in combat remained a tradition among certain armies.\nIt is possible that these animals served merely as ceremonial guard animals during certain religious festivals.\nThey would subsequently have come into the possession of some local princes or monasteries.\nOf those armies that

{"prompt":"The first of U @ - @ 44 's two patrols began on 6 January 1940 when she left Wilhelmshaven for the North Sea , eventually circumnavigating the British Isles , travelling as far south","text":"The first of U @ - @ 44's two patrols began on 6 January 1940 when she left Wilhelmshaven for the North Sea, eventually circumnavigating the British Isles, travelling as far south as Cape Finisterre in northwest Spain on 3 February. There she escorted convoy CCS-3, formed by the British freighter S.S. Northumberland, four merchant steamers, one tug and thirteen submarines, which had left Plymouth for Germany. The convoy was bombed by the German U-boat  U - 55, which sunk the tug Kindermann  on 9 January. Although convoy CCS-3 was one of the most successful convoys on which U @ - @ 44 had been engaged, she also assisted in the destruction of the battleship HMS\u00a0Dreadnought, which the sub had sunk a week earlier. \nIn March 1940, U @ - @ 44 and her convoy of merchant ships from the North Sea to Scapa Flow were intercepted by U - 20. U B - 40, with the German destroyer SMS\u00a0Westerham and a British destroyer under attack by Japanese patrols outside the Firth of Forth, was reported to be in pursuit and was sent to investigate. Although it was later discovered that U B - 40 was in position of some 80 miles, U @ - @ 44 was ordered to join the destroyer division. The submarine, however, was unable to reach her position and, having approached the U-boat, the destroyers had to disengage and turn around with the ship lying some 80 miles to the northwest, while U @ - @ 44 had her engines set to maximum. Some hours later U @ - @ 44 was sent to escort the escort convoy ECS-11 to the Firth of Forth, which was also attacked by a large group of Japanese subs that turned out to be Japanese Navy Yachts. U @ - @ 44 sank her third Yomotsu, a cruising vessel named Yomotsu Maru ; she was unable to follow the small escort steamers off the coast of Dumbarton and turned inland to join convoy PXS-8, which was also in position to enter the Firth. Shortly after U @ - @ 44 joined her convoy it was attacked by a Japanese torpedo bomber ; two torpedoes hit U @ - @ 44 just after midnight and she sank after one minute. The Uboats crew made little difficulty in abandoning their craft, but it took almost a half-hour for the other sub in convoy to find U @ - @ 44. When U @ - @ 44 sank more than 2,000 metres short of her target, her officers thought it best to give up the search ; she was subsequently discovered at a depth of nearly 1,300\u00a0metres when the British destroyer HMS\u00a0Falmouth was ordered to sink a depth-diving submarine. The UBoat carried only four of her crew aboard and, during the first eight hours of her sinking, only a third of the water pumped by the U-boat could be released.

{"prompt":"For the second consecutive race , the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole . Michael Schumacher set the fastest time , but a five @ - @ place grid penalty","text":"For the second consecutive race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a five @ - @ place grid penalty was imposed for overtaking in the pit lane. Button started the race in twelfth, but was unable to challenge the lead of Schumacher and was forced to retire with a broken radiator.\nLap 34 was the first time that the team\u2019s drivers had been overtaken at the start and was their last occasion to be involved with the \u201c black box \u201d and was only seen by Stewart and his team at the pit lane barrier. A full investigation revealed that Jenson Button could not be heard asking for permission to overtake Michael Schumacher, only having been told he was allowed to overtake when the pitlane barriers had closed. The Team said the car had a flat spot on the right front tyre and he could not hear the \u2018can you overtake\u2019 whistle.\nAlthough Team Principal Flavio Briatore had been reluctant to admit this and claimed Jenson Button was actually informed of the possibility of an incident being reported, and still did not confirm if the incident took place.\nAt the end of the race, the stewards held a hearing to discuss the incident, and the team told the Stewards that it did not matter to them what Button was told or heard.\nIt was also discussed, as to why the team did not say anything to Button if there had been an incident. The team did admit that it was reluctant to go to the Stewards. They argued that if they did report this incident, there was a risk that he would be blacklisted as a result of the incident and the race had to be called off on lap 34. However, Button had not only overtaken on purpose, he was also allowed by his team, which he then acknowledged was against the rules, and he also attempted to make contact with Michael Schumacher prior to the start.\nStewart argued that although the crew were aware that it was against the rules, nothing could be done. Button, on the contrary, said they were not to blame, but did agree that a formal appeal process should be brought.\n\u201c As a racing team, we had no control, because we didn\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t give a toss about the outcome. The result was an obvious penalty and he was only doing what the rules called for. \u201d\nEven without the incident, Button thought \u201c the car got a little out of hand at the start \u201d on the way out into turn one, but when asked where he had gone wrong, he said this was only from then on. However, he still did not think his team or F1 were doing enough to handle this situation.\n\u201c I mean, all teams have people on watch. You don\u2019t need to be a cock with the radio on, it just has to be on. \u201d\nButton explained that he was \u201c not worried in terms of his career \u201d as a result of the incident, but if the

{"prompt":"In July 1945 , Lawton handed in a transfer request at Everton as he wanted a move to a Southern club so as to see more of his increasingly estranged wife . In November 1945","text":"In July 1945, Lawton handed in a transfer request at Everton as he wanted a move to a Southern club so as to see more of his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, a move to Charlton Athletic in England was agreed, but the move fell through when it was ruled that Lawton had breached the English Football League regulations by not registering at the English Football League to play for another club prior to signing with an English team.\nAt the end of the 1946-47 season, Lawton was released from Everton and moved to Stoke City.\nLawton's career in England saw him play at Everton and Stoke City, scoring 29 goals in 91 appearances before leaving England in 1953 to be a coach in the English Midlands. The move marked his coming of age because he had to overcome the hardships of the wartime war. He lived in a cottage on the property of a farmer, a life which he called the hardest he had ever been through. He recalled how he had never been out of England before his arrival but that his experience in the English countryside was very important to his growth and development.\nLawton was appointed as an assistant to Bobby Beola and his team won promotion to the First Division in 1963. He left Stoke City after less than 1 year and was appointed as an assistant manager to Bobby Fassbender. Lawton was also involved in coaching at the Under - 18 level and was later appointed as an assistant coach for Birmingham City and then again for Preston North End  in 1969. He also played alongside Ray Wilkins whilst in the Republic of Ireland  during the late Seventies and Eighties.\nIn 1975, Lawton returned to Ireland and was appointed as the Second Team Coach at Dun Laoghaire Rovers. Lawton remained at Dun Laoghaire for 3 years and led the team to promotion to the First Division. His time at Dun Laoghaire had a major influence on the development of the team; many of the top players at Dun Laoghaire Rovers at that time were players who had spent time with Lawton at Everton and Stoke. He led Dun Laoghaire to the Football League Cup in 1976.\nLawton was appointed as the Football League Manager of Dun Laoghaire Rovers in 1976, and won the Railway Division 2 in 1979. Lawton coached the team for a further 4 years before leaving to manage St Patrick's Athletic in Dublin. It was whilst he was at St Patrick's that he was injured in an accident that injured him very badly when his van collided with a tractor.\nHe later worked as a football scout before dying in December 1988 - He had been suffering from serious disease for some time.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nA lifetime achievement award was presented to Mr Lawton by the Cork District Football League in 2001 to recognise his contribution to the development of the club and the county league.  Mr Lawton was also a member of the Cork Club Football Committee and was in charge of overseeing the promotion of the club to the Cork Football League.\n\nDeath\n\nOn December 8, 1988, in his retirement home, Mr Lawton died from meningitis after spending the weekend with his young grandson. In his will he left his entire estate, the sum of $35,000, to his grandson.  His death was the cause of much mourning because he had only been ill for a short time and a year before he was still coaching the Under 18 side.","token_len":696,"entropy":[8.0333,7.8791,0.1965,11.7697,3.4892,8.0439,2.8389,1.4735,6.9388,2.9392,6.1303,10.0559,4.9689,3.0376,3.6428,2.6594,3.9942,0.4686,4.6517,7.3424,4.3601,6.2138,3.6953,0.323,5.1454,7.3399,1.326,0.8622,10.9368,7.5503,1.2158,1.0867,3.9832,3.2666,0.9192,0.2692,3.6431,4.8568,0.6604,6.7641,0.0477,2.0441,3.7041,2.4206,0.6832,2.6119,1.7505,1.5022,2.4847,2.8637,2.1728,0.076,2.4362,4.0045,0.7224,6.2735,1.096,1.7435,0.0006,1.5411,5.3954,1.2919,5.3144,1.2642,1.5954,3.8073,1.4196,3.6377,3.7036,3.3808,1.9543,4.5298,1.0087,0.6534,5.2369,1.1468,1.3405,4.3257,0.3478,6.7053,0.0024,3.9886,1.6927,4.9573,0.9188,2.7681,0.3142,1.082,10.6879,0.783,1.9163,0.0017,1.1121,4.5834,0.8562,0.0628,0.1266,0.3376,0.4294,0.0005,1.7122,3.9226,0.5114,2.2649,1.5168,1.8457,0.206,4.5404,0.6954,1.1447,2.7929,1.3638,0.0018,1.97,3.0451,1.8593,0.7943,4.156,0.2338,1.9586,4.2613,4.3651,2.0999,2.6758,0.2904,1.2299,2.7634,5.2351,0.1401,0.8543,6.2659,0.5461,3.7376,2.784,4.3486,1.4115,3.6397,1.8493,4.7046,2.367,4.2227,2.1298,1.5614,3.4444,7.5754,1.6319,3.9047,4.5741,7.414,1.8178,7.678,2.5999,0.0054,7.5645,1.4485,1.2095,4.6163,5.2643,1.9855,5.4712,0.2365,2.5254,5.7728,3.3736,1.7238,2.0996,5.9997,0.9794,2.0944,4.9303,2.1675,1.0947,5.4325,0.9403,2.0677,6.0409,1.9842,4.1084,5.0357,2.8064,1.7573,3.9697,3.4678,7.2489,2.4287,0.1824,0.2502,3.0328,1.5613,0.243,2.0323,5.6814,2.5976,1.3165,1.6451,3.955,1.2319,4.8124,0.5134,4.5723,1.8801,2.9866,1.8954,4.6318,2.4138,2.5174,5.2221,1.9754,1.2265,3.5864,2.7469,1.7748,3.48,3.3934,0.8159,2.3881,5.5268,1.7779,2.236,0.4442,0.6394,1.365,0.0023,1.8394,4.0905,1.7511,2.6466,0.5062,2.3897,6.7113,6.7159,10.3305,2.6866,3.2566,3.3569,4.2911,1.8571,0.239,0.265,3.4525,0.1019,1.0957,4.5998,0.5356,1.5255,4.3505,1.962,0.4181,3.3027,6.1779,0.003,6.6165,0.8026,1.2519,2.21,2.5415,1.9147,2.5065,0.1251,2.1976,1.7534,4.5489,7.9461,5.8451,0.3936,1.0565,3.1597,0.0019,1.7217,2.8856,3.2213,0.1652,4.5226,2.4665,2.2797,5.597,11.663,5.0719,1.9822,1.8557,1.8404,4.9433,1.7187,1.1329,1.8494,0.1304,0.8752,2.9766,5.9289,0.8198,2.8372,3.8716,5.5054,1.6331,5.4873,0.3462,0.0063,12.8336,10.2656,3.1916,0.315,1.7594,2.3736,1.4362,5.4841,6.2161,5.023,0.8512,7.3711,2.5323,1.9049,5.4582,0.2084,0.0055,3.2969,1.912,0.5901,4.4868,4.5516,0.002,0.9558,1.5894,0.0,0.4588,0.6968,2.3602,3.2955,0.5286,0.6579,0.0009,3.7115,0.0878,5.5915,1.5396,1.9192,1.4097,1.1149,2.0798,7.7486,3.2669,0.6347,2.4174,6.7286,1.9309,0.0026,0.0,7.2253,0.0633,1.1493,2.3925,0.0007,5.8134,1.781,1.1983,0.0018,0.0019,0.0009,1.4909,4.261,1.0576,1.6277,4.9701,0.6576,1.72,0.4021,2.019,0.225,0.2149,1.5724,0.1055,2.1198,3.8987,3.5749,1.034,0.8269,0.0046,0.0045,0.0008,4.0122,2.4557,3.2446,2.3817,0.2299,1.3093,2.5763,0.0596,1.101,1.9658,6.1084,4.8804,0.6401,0.5194,6.5981,0.3422,3.0451,2.426,0.0038,0.0064,0.0014,5.0409,0.0,5.9468,1.4941,0.0304,0.6558,4.1756,1.0787,0.934,3.6765,0.704,2.0762,0.7239,0.001,2.6109,3.7324,1.8656,1.3867,2.2034,2.489,4.4581,3.1286,0.0023,0.0052,0.0006,0.8445,1.6033,4.9113,0.1508,2.2855,2.0698,2.4331,1.9876,0.8445,0.8859,0.0014,1.551,2.4353,1.3094,1.2186,3.3439,0.5867,2.1933,1.0379,5.9002,0.0029,0.0054,0.0009,0.9426,0.0002,0.7446,3.8643,2.3123,1.9221,4.4016,1.3642,13.1025,5.6346,4.3586,1.8123,2.187,0.3516,1.905,0.0007,4.368,1.6878,2.2515,1.8434,2.5112,3.9687,2.8743,0.5017,1.0698,2.3187,1.3006,5.4742,5.233,3.8639,0.0522,0.2328,0.9519,5.4554,0.7322,5.5476,0.276,8.7089,2.6941,0.3307,1.21,0.5568,0.0614,0.0021,0.7156,0.5304,1.964,5.7872,2.0464,2.291,0.6876,3.1417,3.7005,1.8945,6.4443,0.7282,6.0578,3.3478,5.4722,1.7409,0.0721,0.5202,3.6415,1.4476,2.3552,2.9874,4.3866,3.405,1.0763,0.6275,3.5642,4.8635,5.601,8.6733,0.8861,4.6904,3.9276,8.3875,6.5698,2.1092,1.364,4.7139,0.171,4.508,6.3669,1.3472,2.7317,0.0894,1.0325,1.0225,7.6486,3.7871,3.0467,1.2702,4.4706,0.0002,0.4224,0.0106,3.1923,7.2468,0.839,1.5848,2.5174,2.1458,0.4484,4.6181,1.3012,0.001,1.1724,1.2974,6.7155,6.7464,2.5259,3.361,1.7613,4.3743,5.1984,1.6413,0.6839,1.6793,0.1987,0.6622,3.2276,0.0827,0.6697,2.0383,1.8778,1.5974,4.7945,4.5315,0.5014,6.9586,6.8316,0.1273,0.0007,1.1221,1.5429,2.815,1.7556,0.0312,0.2683,2.2569,5.7069,1.8586,3.1542,1.4855,1.4984,5.0198,0.5547,0.0227,6.3085,0.5504,4.0661,0.3031,0.6804,1.8911,1.0813,0.3732,6.1303,0.7948,0.1483,1.1163,0.9558,0.0076,9.5213,0.6589,0.0003,2.4542,3.8609,3.1627,0.2854,3.6785,0.1871,4.3384,2.21,5.6343,2.7113,1.414,1.9899,0.0679,0.0006,1.0902,2.141,10.1979,0.1107,0.0328,3.0081,5.1341,2.5274,5.2411,1.9378,0.2194,6.5833,5.1725,1.593,4.0919,1.8432,5.5833,1.6531,5.9958,2.0071,8.8938,1.3377,2.3089,3.3782,5.492,0.3041,2.3743,4.7309,0.1605,0.3219,0.871,1.2174,1.1974,4.269,1.4947,2.2498,2.45,3.2552,1.0681,3.6788,4.2678,0.0869,3.1633,3.1892,5.8801,1.5017,0.9752,5.4048,1.3085,6.4686,0.2846,1.6693,1.7078,0.4995,1.4963,5.3203,4.5043,2.7924,1.7819,1.6882,6.8035,7.0986,3.1166,4.9672,2.5574,2.5065,0.5857]}
{"prompt":"Evidence of a fractured hip bone was found in a specimen of Iguanodon , which had an injury to its ischium . Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone","text":"Evidence of a fractured hip bone was found in a specimen of Iguanodon, which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone surface wear. Also, four individuals were found with fractured vertebrae of the neck region. These fractures were probably caused by caribou-hip and the caribou-hip was also involved in crushing other species and crushing and spilling other bones and tooth material on the bone surfaces.\nIn view of what evidence was recovered for the carnivore species and the potential for carnivores to crush and devour Iguanodon tibiae and femora in this area, it is likely that any carnivores which lived in this area would have had an avidity or lust for the bone. These observations may also suggest that the carnivores feeding on the bones may have had little or no knowledge as to the actual value of the species under study, while the predators which ate the flesh had a much better idea of the species.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe main findings of this study are as follows:\n(1) Iguanodon tibiae and femora occur in the Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstones of western Saskatchewan.\n(2) The age of the Iguanodon tibiae and femora recovered for this study is approximately 20 million years.\n(3) The carnivores and other large land-dwelling vertebrate predators that were active during the time of deposition of the sandstone units in Saskatchewan were Iguanodon tibiae and femora. In particular, it is likely that carnivores had an increased preference for these bones over later vertebrate fossils which were deposited in the same units.\n(4) In the case of the small mammals and reptiles, there is little to no evidence and information to suggest that they were the sources for the Iguanodon tibiae and femora that were recovered in this study. However, it is thought that they could have been the sources for the carnivores that preyed on the species being studied here.\n(5) There is evidence that the Iguanodon tibiae and femora were deposited in a rocky, sandy matrix environment similar to areas where reptiles of this species were found.\n(6) It is thought that the carnivores were more avid for Iguanodon tibiae and femora than other kinds of large vertebrate predators because they could be found in much higher numbers than the dinosaurs themselves. This was also probably true because these predators would have been able to dig more easily through the more loose matrix which has an abundance of iguanodon bones.\n(7) It is believed that if the carnivores and other predators could effectively locate and eat them from the ground, they could get a lot more meat from these species than they could from later and more fragile fossilized vertebrates. The carnivores may have a different tastes and preferences for the bones than do the predators which eat the meat.\n(8) Since the carnivores may have preferred this bone species, they could have a

{"prompt":"To reach Los Angeles , the Santa Fe leased trackage rights over the Southern Pacific from San Bernardino on November 29 , 1885 , at $ 1 @ , @ 200 per mile per year","text":"To reach Los Angeles, the Santa Fe leased trackage rights over the Southern Pacific from San Bernardino on November 29, 1885, at $ 1 @, @ 200 per mile per year. The same day, the railroad paid for two switches at Arroyo, one of which was put on the same day. On December 5, the SantaFe paid for a switch at the Arroyo -La Paz, which was put on December 21.\nThe Santa Fe paid for equipment at the Arroyo La Paz -La Paz in November and was ready the next month, including a switch there. After the Santa Fe was completed, work began on the Los Angeles line. It would have to extend from the Los Angeles -San Bernardino railroad ( later called the Los Angeles Northern Railway, as the Santa Fe was then called ) to Los Angeles on the old Southern Pacific trackage. The Los Angeles Northern ( later called the Southern Pacific Railway ) in turn leased the trackage rights from San Bernardino to Los Angeles to build out the line. The Los Angeles Northern paid $ @,, for the trackage rights in the spring of 1886.\nBy May 23, the workmen had completed the section between Santa Fe and Smyths. They were working on two steam engines ( both were put on that day ) and on a locomotive switch. The Los Angeles Northern would own the trackage rights from Los Angeles to the end of the line at the Los Angeles River.\nIn the spring of 1887, work began on the extension of the Los Angeles Northern line into Los Angeles itself. It was supposed to be completed by August 25. It would be a short spur to connect with the trackage rights owned by the Santa Fe at Los Angeles. The trackage rights were worth the Santa Fe $ 5 4 @ in 1885. The Southern Pacific sold the trackage rights to the Los Angeles Northern for $ 100 at the beginning of the year.\nIn May of 1887 workmen began putting through sleepers. It is interesting to note that work on the rail lines between Los Angeles and San Diego was completed, and the Los Angeles and San Bernardino tracks were ready for cars to run on them, before work on this spur near Sacramento began.\nWork on the Los Angeles Northern from San Bernardino to the Rivers took two years and a half and cost $ 1 3 - $, 4.\nThe California Railroad Association was formed in the spring of 1888, with the intention of bringing about an orderly process for the construction of rails throughout the state.\nEarly in the morninS of the 25th, a committee of seven individuals was appointed to write a report to the California Railroad Association, setting forth the circumstances of the entire subject ; and it was ordered at an executive meeting that the said report and a proposed agreement should be submitted to the association for its consideration.\nThe committee consisted of Messrs. Thomas A. Baker, John J. Brigham, William F. Cameron, J. J. Chamberlin, John F. Cooley, and John J.

After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks , on","text":"Within weeks of the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Nazi policy toward the Jews changed from voluntary emigration to forced deportation. After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks, on 1 September 1939 Czechoslovak Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr B\u00e9la Klement proposed the adoption of a decree for the deportation of the Jews already in Czechoslovakia, a new decree for the expulsion of the Jews from other countries, including the Soviet Union, and the imposition of a ban on emigration by Jewish emigrants from abroad, the latter being a consequence of the Nazi invasion of Poland. The deportations and ban on emigration reached their peak in the period from September 1939 to June 1940 during the War in Europe. At the time the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia ended in March, a report found that 1,300,000 Jews in Czechoslovakia had been deported, and at least 2,000,000 had either voluntarily left Czechoslovakia to join Polish Jews before they became victims of the Nazi system or at least had emigrated to another country (1).\nAround a month later, the Jewish Agency for the Protection of the Jews in Poland and the Soviet-governed territories received orders from the Polish authorities to start deportations. By November 1939, a total of 100,000 Jews in Poland had been \"repatriated\". The number of deportations began to rise from the beginning of the war.\nIn October 1939, the first order to deport Jews to Poland from Russia was given. By 11 November, 20,000 Jews from Prague were deported to Warsaw by the Czechoslovak special police. In early February 1940, the authorities of the Soviet Union ordered Jewish emigration. Some 80,000 Jewish emigrated from the Soviet Union to the United States. In Moscow, deportations began to escalate on 10 March 1940 when a number of Jews were arrested. Later that month, a new order was given to deport Jews from abroad, but the Nazis could not follow it, as they were still fighting Poland.\nIn the following two years, Jews were deported from the Soviet Union to Poland with the assistance of the Warsaw Ghetto Police. After the war, many Jews from Hungary were deported to the Soviet Union, though others returned to Hungary after the war.\nThe first waves of deportations of Jews to Auschwitz began shortly before Christmas 1939, with their official start at the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto, and continued into the spring of 1940. By the end of the year, around 2,000 Jews had been deported to Auschwitz, a third to the Treblinka death camp, and a fifth to Buchenwald. The concentration camps were soon at full capacity and the Nazis began to transfer the Jews arriving to Germany from the deportations into them, including at Buchenwald.\nDuring the night of the 26\u201327 March 1941, around 2,000 Polish Jews were deported from Krakow to Treblinka and then shipped to Auschwitz in truckloads.\nAs of September 1943, around 1.1 million Jews were deported either from the Soviet Union or from the rest of the West to Treblinka, Buna, and Auschwitz.\nPolish Jews from Germany were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis by the beginning of April 1941. There were only 20 deportation transports from Germany to Poland from the beginning of the war to 1941.

It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily , but","text":"A depression that had formed on July 30 from a tropical disturbance quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Glenda. It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily, but turned northward upon reaching the Appalachian Mountains, making landfall in North Carolina on August 14. Glenda produced light to moderate wind gusts and heavy rainfall over much of the southern United States.\nHurricane Glenda was named for Glenda, the saintly and noble Queen of the Romans, and its appearance in eastern North Carolina was the first time that the state had ever seen a named tropical cyclone. Glenda was the third tropical storm to make landfall on the east coast of North Carolina in the month of August. In 2005, Hurricane Emily caused major damages in a similar area, and in 2008 Hurricane Bonnie caused some damage to eastern North Carolina.\n\nImpact\n\nGlenda made landfall in eastern North Carolina along the southern coast on August 14 with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (112\u00a0km\/h). Although the landfall area experienced light to moderate wind gusts, some areas sustained tornado damage and heavy rainfall from the storm and a number of flooding incidents were reported.\nAt 3am August\u00a014, tornadoes struck the towns of Stagg's Mill and Groveton, destroying many homes. Glenda also affected eastern North Carolina with light to moderate sustained winds that left several homes and businesses damaged. In the evening of August\u00a014, Glenda struck the coastal town of Wilmington, causing $25,000 in damage, but no evacuations were required.   In other inland areas, Glenda had little impact, with no damage being reported in Chapel Hill.\nA few light flooding incidents were reported from the coastal counties, but mostly in late August. The worst damage was caused by the Gunter River near Wilmington, which was reported to be a foot lower on August 17 compared to before the passage of Glenda.\nNear the coast, the highest rainfall totals were near Hilton Head, South Carolina, where the highest total in any one county was 1.5 inches (38\u00a0mm). Winds of over 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km\/h) were measured near the coastline at the mouth of the Pamlico River.\nGlenda made landfall over eastern North Carolina just before the onset of the first major heat wave of 2012. The coastal counties recorded temperatures of 105 to 113\u00a0\u00b0F (44 to 49\u00a0\u00b0C), and some of the inland areas of North Carolina had a daytime temperature of around 87\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C). The high temperatures and lack of humidity made residents and tourists uncomfortable, and many local businesses closed for business.\n\nPreparations\n\nThe U.S. Weather Service had issued warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms as far inland as Asheville. The National Weather Service in Greensboro issued a weather and warnings bulletin the night before Glenda, suggesting that the area would be affected by strong thunderstorms and heavy winds.\nSeveral counties in the Carolinas and Virginia had issued hurricane warnings for Glenda on August\u00a013. \nAs a result of the storm, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the U.S. Southern District released more than 6,000\u00a0t (5,500 long tons) of sand to the Pamlico River and Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAftermath\n\nMore than $1\u00a0million was spent on damage to homes and businesses from the storm.","token_len":701,"entropy":[11.1672,3.2451,4.293,6.8947,3.314,5.7384,3.4871,6.2406,1.821,10.2881,5.7962,9.1827,7.879,2.9691,0.5388,4.9898,2.2029,3.6382,3.2967,5.5964,7.9461,5.3018,0.8125,2.7239,5.551,2.7896,7.8301,3.7711,0.0307,8.5264,8.2514,0.2388,9.7596,2.4907,1.5019,6.3136,2.9848,1.7014,7.8096,3.493,1.2243,6.2958,0.4486,2.0451,4.4235,1.0056,1.4648,3.6439,0.1937,0.8372,1.5632,3.5695,0.3791,3.8803,0.0056,6.1084,7.2766,2.5219,1.7742,3.5772,2.0457,0.0088,2.6423,4.2343,1.9991,4.2604,2.5842,0.0029,0.6366,4.2703,1.8665,0.0031,0.9401,1.3226,17.2248,0.155,4.5153,0.0079,1.9843,1.6633,2.7152,4.4954,0.0157,1.3809,1.3205,8.0329,1.9817,3.041,4.9156,6.7309,0.3565,0.9354,6.8793,1.1441,2.3192,3.2547,4.6881,2.5211,6.6899,1.1329,0.1614,1.8502,2.7753,1.8621,3.59,1.2309,1.8214,4.6403,0.844,1.7116,1.2304,0.9772,8.3213,2.6604,2.8222,0.003,0.34,2.7673,0.0047,1.1556,2.5858,2.994,2.9986,1.0852,0.6915,2.5146,0.0139,1.4896,0.6144,4.7389,0.1746,0.3523,0.834,0.0667,1.4332,1.5118,5.2894,0.0407,0.6044,1.3126,3.0397,6.6759,0.1825,1.6913,6.6865,3.2002,3.9441,5.3444,1.2676,3.8263,4.9826,3.5103,1.737,2.0702,1.9802,2.4912,3.2244,7.7255,1.5975,4.9512,1.0948,1.517,6.63,0.6739,0.007,0.6555,0.9737,7.3371,7.6573,0.4243,2.3493,0.0003,2.3211,0.0163,4.4551,0.0422,0.9954,4.1469,0.0299,0.0009,5.4843,0.455,4.0552,2.1153,4.2734,0.734,0.9842,3.3516,5.3927,0.2226,0.0449,0.1645,3.985,14.1167,1.3512,1.189,4.3576,1.8395,1.3225,0.4864,0.0056,0.8826,4.379,1.4398,5.661,4.5509,5.9503,6.1296,1.346,0.191,2.0212,0.2186,0.0174,0.8672,4.8732,2.4785,4.7965,8.1261,0.9835,1.7905,3.3635,1.1584,4.685,1.6807,1.7833,3.911,3.384,2.8248,0.0446,5.4732,3.3703,4.0221,0.6051,0.4418,1.4169,4.9389,5.2947,4.5108,5.65,13.1698,1.7008,0.3891,8.8965,0.0427,3.4432,1.3921,6.1856,0.1165,5.1622,8.6598,5.3772,5.3878,0.8837,7.9872,5.2572,0.8264,8.939,3.7751,0.6472,1.8858,4.0217,0.0138,2.9314,4.2128,6.0811,0.3836,0.0086,2.5835,5.6612,0.19,0.1222,6.3013,0.1049,3.5979,5.2385,3.313,1.6198,2.2158,1.2769,2.2598,0.4966,2.8438,1.8669,3.6115,0.8672,0.1537,5.5052,1.7784,0.2678,2.4174,0.0024,3.0577,1.5949,4.3557,2.2358,0.0158,7.0019,0.8071,3.4251,5.446,4.0271,0.5214,0.0413,0.951,0.3532,2.4375,3.6847,2.1807,7.2059,0.0346,0.411,4.2826,0.3982,7.4565,9.1983,4.9795,5.2825,7.0404,1.0786,0.4919,1.5204,0.0034,3.9992,5.2606,0.7745,2.363,1.5792,2.9978,2.9821,4.8501,0.2091,3.0622,9.975,0.008,1.7749,0.5853,3.8183,3.3411,8.4269,6.7806,0.8239,1.7243,0.4412,3.3975,1.3277,3.2115,5.1235,3.3168,1.7015,5.4474,2.3789,7.8596,0.3407,1.3687,2.3309,4.0634,2.6072,1.0447,1.8897,0.2089,1.8014,12.4893,2.3356,3.2861,3.3569,3.9441,0.6934,1.9558,1.6523,4.7805,0.4959,0.9751,3.4725,5.8003,8.2171,3.6817,2.9784,4.234,4.7149,0.1807,7.6821,1.21,10.266,0.061,1.6133,0.005,0.2014,1.4735,6.4581,1.7986,3.3171,1.1821,1.9388,5.6713,3.1672,4.3196,0.9922,6.3242,9.0031,0.4749,1.0663,4.3028,0.1051,0.6451,2.1332,1.7017,2.569,3.4422,3.7778,5.8963,4.9371,4.4267,0.5932,4.4689,0.6726,2.0898,0.5751,0.4005,5.197,2.21,0.9838,1.2045,6.7701,2.0098,4.1834,3.4982,1.9099,0.1471,0.1411,4.3379,0.1044,0.0369,0.0315,0.0018,0.1852,0.801,5.8525,3.9194,1.5058,5.5073,3.0221,1.9548,5.9762,0.0153,0.2283,7.729,0.471,0.0047,0.2893,1.0809,1.0811,2.8747,0.0094,3.1138,0.0404,5.3202,3.7429,0.0703,0.002,6.5047,1.1383,3.3582,5.0389,0.0041,0.6992,3.4216,2.3626,7.7387,0.1239,2.644,4.8963,0.6022,1.5633,5.9608,1.315,4.8923,4.4926,1.287,5.2763,3.8353,4.2925,1.4286,1.8336,0.5384,0.1198,4.3291,0.2991,3.4892,0.2769,0.1593,0.0395,1.4731,1.7573,4.1956,2.0313,0.2165,4.9526,1.5802,3.4887,1.7764,0.0145,3.0219,3.5752,8.0473,1.3841,0.2628,4.6892,4.964,1.2879,0.1136,0.0317,0.1145,4.0316,1.6299,0.7017,0.0066,0.3027,1.8461,4.4517,1.3449,2.8306,5.05,0.0022,5.29,3.4026,6.7183,2.1845,3.2366,3.4914,1.5719,1.1627,2.9731,4.8943,1.345,1.612,2.9485,2.5381,0.7477,0.8564,7.6969,5.9808,1.9624,0.6382,0.9888,0.0007,2.024,6.0513,0.0221,0.0177,0.0073,2.5356,0.2872,3.9204,2.2319,3.2564,1.0026,8.1685,0.0366,1.6209,3.8731,1.5536,0.0525,3.9678,4.4789,4.6014,0.1049,4.659,2.5152,1.8015,1.8509,0.2013,0.0021,4.0133,5.9554,0.0316,1.5584,0.6926,4.5504,6.1874,5.7089,1.631,6.2033,3.4001,1.1278,3.0704,0.0024,1.9676,5.9965,0.5218,1.6436,4.093,2.5547,0.7618,2.8225,0.5264,4.1854,3.316,0.0454,1.6416,2.5785,4.5719,0.7438,1.5754,11.1273,3.6111,1.1538,1.2329,2.2067,0.0,3.1295,4.21,1.2503,2.003,4.3352,0.3525,1.6373,1.9145,0.0034,3.8395,0.6691,7.6724,3.006,1.5648,5.2694,2.8805,4.3539,3.1153,1.1406,0.4183,0.7044,2.2037,0.4572,1.8085,2.7795,0.0006,0.002,0.0017,3.1295,0.5293,0.0203,0.0011,2.6413,3.645,4.9271,0.0505,0.0111,0.0188,6.6043,3.5398,5.9328,5.8194,0.962,4.0185,0.498,0.4744,5.2081,4.2618,9.3328,3.5873,0.3892,2.9835,9.4515,1.978,0.0928,0.3452,2.9406,2.5975,2.0425,8.4527,0.0284,0.002,0.3252,2.6137,7.0719,1.1435,1.2838,1.9755,5.001,5.2295,4.0187,0.11,0.0002,6.34,0.2786,4.708,2.3384,5.3834,0.4235,1.2429,1.4684,1.5646,4.2535,2.1233,2.3473,0.8671,0.2138,3.9602,1.4947,0.9844,0.9782]}

Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for the formation of polypeptides. Ribosomes associate with messenger ribonucleic (mRNA) molecules, which contain the genetic instructions necessary for the synthesis of the proteins being produced. Translation is the process by which messenger RNA is used as a template for synthesis of a new protein, and is done by ribosomes RNA is the major component of messenger RNA. Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein.\nTranslation in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells are carried out by ribosomes. Ribosomes are large complexes of RNA and protein, found in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes, and the cytoplasm of bacteria, and are responsible for the formation of polypeptides. mRNA is the major component of messenger RNA.

Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesis of a new protein. Most proteins are synthesized by enzymes. Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesis of a new protein.\nTranslation is the process of converting an RNA molecule into a protein. Translation is the process of turning an RNA molecule into a protein. Translation is accomplished through both transcriptional and post transcriptional processes. Translation is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesis of a new protein.\nTo create the protein synthesis machines, we take a single gene called the structural gene encoding for tRNA and modify it so that its translation products function in the synthesis of new RNA instead of function as ribosomal RNA.\nSomehow, they manage to incorporate a new DNA segment into the RNA polymerase enzyme, enabling them to produce new protein.\nWhen this process is done with the DNA segment encoding the structural gene for tRNA, it will result in enzymes that can synthesize only protein instead of RNA. What a novel way to control gene expression!\nThe process of mRNA degradation was first discovered in the early 1950\u2019s as a way to help regulate the RNA levels needed to build proteins.","token_len":702,"entropy":[4.3317,2.8241,5.0241,1.7013,0.0021,1.4661,9.0144,9.2869,4.1589,0.9839,5.8867,2.434,0.4622,2.9687,0.3762,5.8032,0.1536,2.0604,1.612,1.3765,0.8752,8.1823,0.83,4.9677,0.0186,0.7694,8.399,0.1776,1.0368,1.2694,7.5399,4.433,0.4364,2.9551,2.6054,1.4243,7.5643,0.0048,1.6798,4.1541,0.1261,7.3395,0.2484,0.0001,0.4787,1.1832,3.6513,0.0123,0.2437,9.5833,1.4832,6.7224,4.2439,3.9502,0.0167,1.7409,7.8667,2.5306,0.2608,0.2125,1.3769,1.5409,1.2055,3.4227,2.0615,6.0101,3.5435,2.3654,0.4822,1.5791,1.8463,0.0813,1.6066,3.0405,6.4576,3.0121,0.4032,6.3535,0.9852,3.6549,0.3958,0.1465,0.0,7.322,2.0785,2.0141,1.3887,0.2715,0.0428,0.026,0.037,2.4665,0.1586,0.4681,0.0556,0.0679,3.965,1.8435,2.3106,5.0874,0.595,3.9486,0.0575,0.2145,11.0432,2.9895,1.8206,4.8901,2.4513,0.2314,5.6261,0.2827,1.6115,5.1935,0.3812,3.3842,0.0625,0.0681,0.0,1.3693,0.4627,0.1525,0.0135,0.0484,0.025,0.0383,0.0054,0.0048,0.0078,0.1879,0.0084,0.0356,0.0187,0.0459,0.3038,1.4984,19.3528,5.0233,8.3809,0.0002,0.0001,0.0004,0.0004,3.4013,5.2682,1.2498,4.7188,3.0356,0.0149,0.4579,2.5233,0.0117,0.0668,1.2584,1.0081,0.0052,0.0763,1.4904,4.04,0.6452,0.1891,0.4947,0.8093,0.2768,2.8772,7.2926,0.4536,1.3878,5.366,0.8735,0.0064,0.007,0.0004,0.0031,0.0002,1.9107,6.1991,0.0208,0.002,0.2741,1.2934,1.7514,3.2835,5.28,0.0659,0.0169,0.0001,1.2218,3.0674,2.0438,2.8283,1.4073,1.6582,0.0056,0.7565,1.6122,0.1325,3.3174,0.0164,0.0005,0.0545,0.6326,5.1994,0.9901,0.7442,1.9462,0.2693,0.0934,3.8981,0.1169,0.4787,2.4712,0.2739,0.6009,0.0176,0.0168,0.0001,3.9736,0.0455,0.0142,0.0032,0.0649,0.0038,0.0024,0.0175,0.3331,0.0048,0.0103,0.0042,0.0163,0.5087,0.076,0.0646,0.3185,0.0172,0.1213,0.0009,0.0198,1.0326,0.0586,0.0034,0.0193,0.0016,0.0022,0.1261,0.0003,0.0434,4.4212,0.2668,0.0414,0.0055,0.0013,0.0003,0.0988,0.0126,0.0113,0.0018,0.0033,0.0006,0.0086,0.0015,0.0005,0.0011,1.3566,0.0096,0.0034,0.0007,0.002,2.0638,4.7068,1.0854,0.8068,0.0166,0.0036,0.0003,0.1124,0.1096,0.0171,0.0039,0.0066,0.0038,0.0158,0.0022,0.0007,0.0013,9.2154,3.6488,0.0025,2.8147,0.0326,0.1909,0.4805,2.0717,0.1053,0.194,0.0183,7.9983,0.1178,0.3592,0.2451,8.0696,0.1638,0.225,0.0577,0.0635,2.8493,6.7591,1.0294,3.3479,0.0293,3.6978,3.1611,2.9315,0.0084,0.0819,0.65,1.5627,2.2827,0.9283,2.0818,0.0286,0.2316,0.0001,0.2638,0.0834,0.0832,0.0099,0.0145,0.0043,0.7205,0.0033,0.0023,0.0041,1.1009,0.0088,0.0077,0.0007,0.0065,0.4247,1.0618,0.0384,0.0372,0.0064,0.4295,0.0005,0.0325,0.005,0.081,0.007,0.0048,0.0032,0.4713,0.0028,0.0006,0.0027,7.113,0.0024,0.0026,0.001,0.0018,0.4043,0.7739,0.0139,0.0042,0.0067,0.9456,0.0005,0.0251,0.0067,0.1817,0.009,0.0093,0.0034,0.5423,0.003,0.0006,0.0027,5.0058,0.0012,0.0027,0.0015,0.0023,0.0296,0.8341,0.0148,0.0044,0.0094,0.8867,0.0005,0.0241,0.0099,0.1565,0.0092,0.0105,0.0031,0.2918,0.0031,0.0008,0.0024,0.2664,0.0608,0.002,0.2412,0.0016,0.0116,0.0525,1.1625,0.0149,0.0051,0.0102,0.7077,0.0006,0.0304,0.0135,3.6151,0.0029,0.0162,0.0066,0.0039,0.4096,0.0928,0.0025,0.0451,0.0008,0.0279,0.0567,0.0101,0.0008,0.0091,0.1174,0.5906,1.2247,0.1929,0.123,0.014,4.7268,5.7696,3.6675,1.0408,0.2498,0.3093,0.3302,0.3951,0.9768,0.8606,0.1671,0.7787,0.0203,1.5312,0.0033,0.7042,1.4278,0.4703,0.0389,0.308,0.4483,1.1233,0.0378,0.0309,0.109,0.8395,0.0864,0.1196,0.0445,0.0442,0.2872,8.2893,1.7825,1.0687,2.8962,0.0528,0.8584,4.1002,2.7309,2.3471,0.2805,0.2208,0.0206,1.0337,0.0011,0.4067,0.3515,0.1981,0.017,0.0594,0.0618,0.2535,0.0096,0.0064,0.0092,0.1697,0.0057,0.0153,0.0014,0.0066,0.1386,1.8466,1.1372,0.1058,0.0721,0.0246,0.4542,3.537,1.2803,0.236,0.029,0.412,0.2118,0.1194,0.2775,0.2246,0.0094,0.0104,0.0024,1.0142,0.3282,0.0026,0.0057,0.0053,0.0015,0.0035,0.0034,0.0023,1.6734,0.0104,13.5245,2.7941,5.918,3.8913,2.0315,0.0931,5.0955,7.4546,0.0359,1.8758,0.3842,0.9244,0.131,1.6931,0.023,0.8074,0.0001,0.2673,0.0916,0.1241,0.0081,0.0286,0.0083,0.1033,0.0046,0.0034,0.005,0.1158,0.0045,0.0083,0.0009,0.0057,0.1081,0.8609,5.2976,4.4601,2.5673,2.3677,3.5833,8.9138,0.9788,3.9339,4.6918,1.6433,3.4789,4.8648,4.3787,2.4091,7.7048,3.847,3.3802,5.1781,6.7939,0.4709,2.4221,5.3144,0.8,3.2599,0.0986,3.478,2.735,7.1029,6.4929,2.5432,1.2359,5.2817,0.1146,4.1433,3.7097,9.4981,0.0362,9.0494,1.5967,5.4114,0.0133,3.1728,2.8008,0.2654,2.8156,5.8087,7.2193,0.4523,5.5858,5.141,0.1444,6.6613,2.1506,3.0461,5.3196,5.9354,0.862,0.6888,2.48,3.7008,0.4323,5.2185,1.6618,6.1017,1.6128,0.0109,2.9419,2.0367,2.6384,1.1891,1.8456,4.2988,3.1794,2.391,0.644,2.7169,4.4906,1.6351,4.8193,1.9368,7.2471,2.1023,4.6864,0.5335,2.6367,0.6719,0.0087,0.228,1.6088,3.8969,4.4566,0.0048,8.2854,0.8375,2.0702,1.9465,0.0214,6.5205,4.2708,6.8261,0.0253,1.364,0.3411,6.8505,3.9212,4.8406,2.5515,0.6448,5.9582,4.5777,1.0822,2.0496,0.3879,2.3324,3.4168,1.0078,4.606,5.7074,4.3025,2.2778,3.0359,0.9185,1.2366,1.9723,3.1281,16.4028,7.736,2.2543,4.6106,0.7845,2.1424,0.2886,5.994,5.1019,1.3604,5.9811,4.2477,5.9001,0.8873,4.0189,1.5684,0.4388]}

He served as the coach at Oklahoma A","text":"In January 1921, Maulbetsch was hired as the head coach at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College ( now Oklahoma State ) in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He served as the coach at Oklahoma A & M till his retirement in September 1932 when he returned to Stanford University. At Stanford, he coached the baseball teams for 25 years through 1946. The team won seven Pac 10 Conference Championships, two National Championships, won the 1919 World Series and finished second after Los Angeles in the 1926 World Series.\nIn 1919, after the 1919 World Series, Major League Baseball ( MLB ) was in the midst of an unprecedented expansion. MLB wanted to make the World Series a true professional sporting event. However, the Big Four ( Boston, New York, Philadelphia and St. Louis ) refused to allow the teams representing the western states in the National League expansion to be admitted as full professional teams. In 1919, the league agreed with the western expansion teams that players would have to receive compensation of between one and two years of salary if they were to join the league. However, the new rules were not applied to the teams from the eastern and western states. As a result, the expansion teams were forced to be called minor-league teams. After the 1919 World Series, the league sent a letter to the National League expansion teams stating that if they were to play, their salaries would have to be paid \" on the basis of what they earn \" for the first two years of their contracts ( A & M Baseball Encyclopedia ). The Big Four did not answer the letter.\nMiller and the league negotiated and the salary provisions of the expansion contracts were waived. Miller coached the four teams for their first two seasons in the Minor League Baseball system and the teams won their first two championships in the 1920s. When Miller left Stanford after the 1925 season, Bill Wrigley was named the new head coach and led the teams to six more National Championships through 1935.\nAfter leaving Stanford in 1932, Miller remained a consultant for St. Louis until 1956. He was also a professor of baseball at Oklahoma A & M from 1928 to 1945 and at Stanford after 1946.\nIn 1956, Miller joined the Stanford coaching staff after Wrigley left to become the first team president of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was the team's hitting coach for the entire length of his tenure at the club. From 1956 to 1960, the team won two National Championships.\nIn 1960, Miller accepted the job of hitting coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He served as the coach there until 1966, when he went to Arizona State University. He then returned to UNC as the hitting coach for four years before retiring.\nMiller was a recipient of many honors during his long and distinguished career, including being the recipient of the Charles Henry Award as head coach of baseball players at Stanford in 1921 and 1952. In 1921, he was chosen to be a National Team member for the 1921 National Championship season in Chicago.\nFrom 1928 to 1936, he was professor of baseball at Stanford, and in 1946, he was the professor of baseball at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1959, he was awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

{"prompt":"The 2 \/ 4th Machine Gun Battalion was one of four machine gun battalions raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) for service overseas during the Second","text":"The 2 \/ 4th Machine Gun Battalion was one of four machine gun battalions raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) for service overseas during the Second World War.\nA number of its battalion personnel served with the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF) as Royal Australian Reconnaissance Corps troops, being stationed primarily in North America.\nThe Battalion was raised in October 1940 to protect Brisbane and its surrounds from an anticipated invasion by Allied forces, most likely from New Guinea. From September 1944 to December 1946 the Battalion was mainly involved with patrol duties before it was re-activated in January 1947 for a brief campaign involving the defence of Brisbane. It was disbanded again in 1952 for a period of training. After that the Battalion was placed on standby, but was re-activated more than a year later. It was disbanded again in 1955, re-activated in September 1957 and again disbanded in June 1958.\nA selection of pages from the Diary of L & S.F.L. Gower (R. A. C) for the months of October and November 1945.\nThe 2 \/ 4th Machine Gun Battalion was one of the first to deploy with Operation Dynamo. The Battalion was established by a series of detachments throughout the Australian Army. During March to October 1944, members served under the command of the New Guinea Force. The 2nd Machine Gun Battalion was assigned to 1st Armored Brigade, New Guinea and was initially manned by A Company, 3rd Machine Gun Battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel Richard Seddon. After relieving 1st Machine Gun Battalion, 2nd Machine Gun Battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Campbell. During this time, 2nd Machine Gun Battalion provided intelligence for the New Guinea Force which led to Operation Dynamo.\nThe unit arrived in Australia for a few days and was attached to the 4th Infantry Brigade, Australian Army. It was in position to be sent overseas as soon as all the overseas units joined the Commonwealth Forces. This was not the case and it required several weeks for the 4th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Division to deploy and get on its way to New Guinea.\nThe Australian troops were soon going to face the Japanese on the Iwo Jima landings. 1st and 2nd Machine Gun Battalions were given orders to stay and fight the Japanese in New Guinea until all the other Commonwealth units were on the ground.\nWith the troops in Australia and with the Japanese fleeing after the Japanese defeat in the Battle of Iwo Jima, Australian forces landed on New Guinea on 15 March 1945. The first three companies of 2nd Machine Gun Battalion embarked on the Australian warships 'Empress of India', 'Meredyco' and 'Northern Light' leaving Hobart in Tasmania on 25 March 1945.\nThe remainder of the Battlian, along with the troops still in Australia, left Hobart on 19 April 1945 for New Guinea.

Most of the county is only about 15 miles ( 24 km ) wide from its easternmost extremity, from the Hudson River at Otisville to the Lake Ontario shore at Lockport. At the opposite end of the county, it is only about 15 miles wide at the western end from the Niagara River at Erie on the Canadian border to West Sandusky in the Ohio River valley. At the extreme southwest tip, the lake county is only about 50 miles ( 80 km ) wide from the Hudson River at the Delaware County \/ Delaware border south to the Lake Erie shore at Niagara Falls, while the Niagara area of the Niagara and Niagara Escarpment Mountains is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) or more in both directions. The center of the county lies in central Finger Lakes region of New York. This includes the Hudson Valley region, east to the Niagara Escarpment, most of Lake Ontario, south to Lake Ontario and east coast of Michigan, extending along the Lake Ontario \/ Lake Erie border from the western reaches of the Niagara Escarpment to approximately Chadds Ford.\nThe population is 5,025,000 - or 7.4% of the population of the state - concentrated in the center - and south - western edge of Lackawanna, Penobscot and Cayuga Counties in New York State.\nCayuga County is on the south flank of the Green Mountain Range that divides Long Island from New York Lake in the north. It includes a significant portion of what are collectively known as the Southern Tier. This includes the Hudson Valley, part of central and northern New York, western New York, and Pennsylvania. Its southern border with Delaware County, Pennsylvania, crosses the Delaware River, but includes a significant portion of the western edge of the Catskill Mountains.\nCayuga County's northeastern corner, where Lake Ontario borders the northern part of the county, was incorporated into Oswego County, New York in 1839. The north and south of the western part of the county, bordering the Ohio River, was incorporated into Buffalo County in 1856. The western half of what is now Cayuga County was incorporated into Lake Erie County, Ontario in 1882. ( See the map to the south side for more about the historical boundaries of the counties on the borders of Cayuga County. )\nAs a result of many amendments since they were first created, the present limits of Cayuga County can be found in the following:\nA few other small communities now are located partially within the borders of Cayuga County, including:\nChadds Ford, now only a small part of New Canaan in Westchester County in New York, was at some time part of Cayuga County\nThere is a town in southwest Cayuga County that is now part of Hamilton - Niagara, but historically was part of Cayuga County, now part of Hamilton - Niagara :\nThe southern part of the county, however, is now part of Essex County, Ontario ( see the map to the south side for more about the historical boundaries

{"prompt":"On September 4 , 2011 , the Broncos placed Minor on injured reserve . They waived him on October 10 . In November 2011 , he was `` charged with possession of marijuana with intent","text":"On September 4, 2011, the Broncos placed Minor on injured reserve. They waived him on October 10. In November 2011, he was `` charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell '' after officers found the substance at his Denver residence. In December 2011, Minor pleaded guilty to trafficking marijuana, but did not test positive for cocaine. On December 4, 2012, the Denver District Attorney announced he had received an indictment against Minor after serving 15 months of his nine-year prison sentence while incarcerated for the narcotics. The indictment alleges that Minor was selling his own weed to pay off debts he owed. On June 25, 2013, he was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to comply with drug screenings while in prison and after release. Also, Minor was banned from driving for 8 years.\nIn 2010, it was announced that the NHL would test every goaltender annually for illegal substances. In 2014, after testing positive for naproxen and acetaminophen, Minor would miss at least 14 games of the 2015 season, and would not return to a game until three months afterward. After rechecking, he tested positive for caffeine.\nMinor is the sixth player in NHL history to have tests positive for marijuana, with no evidence of subsequent use by the player. In 2001, the NHL sent an annual report to CanLII and the Office of Attorney General regarding their efforts to ensure that they did not have any players under investigation for using or handling marijuana within the league.\nMinor had his contract with the New Jersey Devils extended to a seven-year, $10 million deal in 2013. That team opted to re-sign him to a one-year restricted free agency contract that included $10 million guaranteed during his third season in 2015-16.\nOn April 11, 2015, The Denver Post reported that Minor tested positive for cocaine on March 7, 2015. This would result in him being suspended from the game that day for the next three games, including the New Jersey Devils' home game versus Boston (a game that they lost 7\u201318). Prior to this game, the Devils did not know that Minor had tested positive. In response to the news media reporting that Minor would be suspended for 3 games, the head of the Devils' internal compliance staff, Michael McDermott, said that the team was unaware of any such penalty. However, the team learned of the suspension the next day: on March 11, 2015, in response to a request from the Major League Baseball Authentication Bureau. The Boston game was the Devils \"only\" game they would miss, because the league required them to compete in all 16 regular-season games.\nHowever, in May 2015, NBC Sports reported that he is suspended for the remainder of the 2015 season, while Major League Baseball (MLB) suspended him for the rest of the 2014-15 season. Despite the fact that Minor had never consumed marijuana in his life and that it never tested positive for the substance, he was temporarily suspended for the 2015 season, and then permanently suspended by MLB for the remaining part of that season.\nIn mid-January of 2016, Minor returned to practice with the Devils.

{"prompt":"She has been adapted for the cinema at least ten times , and was one of the earliest films to be made in 1899 as La Colonne de feu ( The Pillar of Fire )","text":"She has been adapted for the cinema at least ten times, and was one of the earliest films to be made in 1899 as La Colonne de feu ( The Pillar of Fire ). ( See also the article in this book about the French production of this film, which is available for the first time in English )\nThe film was also known with the titles : The Wonderful Fire of Alexandria, Fire from the East or Fire from the Pillars of the Temple.\nThe film has been adapted for the radio ( in both French and English ), and again, for a theatre play, with a new score by the composer Igor Stravinsky, and an updated set.\nIn December 1902, the film was produced by the French manufacturer Fr\u00e8res Path\u00e9, using the latest technical methods. The film was directed by an Italian, Filippo de Francesco ( 1878-1952 ) who had studied art under Henri Decomberes in Paris. De Francesco was based at the studios Path\u00e9. It cost some 12,000 francs to produce. In its original projection the film had a height of 3 metres.\nDe Francesco, in the first part of his work, shows the ruins of the Temple of the Sun in Alexandria, while the following scenes show the inhabitants of Alexandria celebrating the festival of the Dedication. The film was one of the first produced by the Path\u00e9 studio.\nIn a scene from a production in 1915. This version by the Danish director Frantisek Mikolajczyk differs in several details from the productions in 1899 and 1902. ( See also the article in this book about the Danish film of this work, which is also available in English )\nFor this piece, De Francesco was based on the text and illustrations by the illustrator Ferdinand Bertholle, whom he first met at the workshop on the Temple of the Sun in Alexandria.\nDe Francesco said in an interview ( in English ) that he wanted to show the Greek world in all its splendour\nHowever, as the scenes were filmed on location in Alexandria, this work is in many ways more realistic than the previous productions. For example, the scenes showing the Egyptians eating and drinking were filmed instead of only showing Greek tables. De Francesco also chose to use Egyptian actors, including a local actress named Helena, who became one of the producers of the films that followed. She also had her own productions of the Greek world in England, where she was the first person in the UK to take a licence to make Greek films.\nThe production was also a success for Fr\u00e8res Path\u00e9. It was seen by a total of seven million people throughout the world. The film was later adapted to film theatres, and the following year, the film was shown at the premiere.\nIn a letter to the director of \u2018La Victoire de Samothrace\u2019, Lord Curzon wrote : \u201c You will not be able to go anywhere else for beauty of action and the interest for us who don\u2019t understand Greek except in your film, which is just as impressive on the screen as in print\u201d.\nLord Durham in Britain was a great admirer of the film, describing it as \u201c as perfect of a work as could possibly be imagined\u201d. He wrote to the director : \u201c I understand you intend to make an adaptation of La Victoire de Samothrace in a cinema play \u2026 in fact you have it all at command

Parts of that state remain without electricity, according to reports. The agency said it was expected that Florida Power and Light Corp. would resume power supply to the area soon.\nTropical Storm Dorian moved down the southeastern United States with heavy rainfall, hauling debris from trees before it weakened Tuesday to a tropical depression.\nThe storm, which slammed into the Florida Keys with heavy rain, now makes landfall near Cedar City, Utah, near the town just north of the Colorado and Arkansas border, the U.S. National Weather Service said.\nA number of counties in Utah have been affected by the storm. Emergency crews were searching for a downed crane in Cedar City Monday.\nTorrential rains forced the cancellation of train services on the Salt Lake - Denver corridor and caused a two-hour delay to shuttle buses from El Centro International Airport to downtown Salt Lake City airport.\nMore than 70 inches of rain were recorded in the Salt Lake Valley. Storm Dorian is now over the Colorado Rockies, and about to hit Arizona, the weather services said on Wednesday.\nA storm watch was issued for all six counties within the Coconino National Forest in northwestern Arizona, while a storm warning was issued for the Coconino National Forest between Tucson and Pima County. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Great Basin Desert from the Mojave Desert to near the Colorado Rocky Mountains.\nThe National Hurricane Center said Dorian was about 280 kilometers east of the southern border of the Pima County area.\nWhile the rains expected to hit Arizona on Wednesday are expected to be mostly short-lived, Dorian could bring down to the 1.2-metre mark the total rainfall in much of the state, including the Grand Canyon area. The heaviest rainfall is expected to hit southwestern Arizona later in the day.\nThe Pima area of southwest Arizona recorded a lifetime rainfall of 3.17 inches. The area received an additional 4.5 inches of rain in the 24 hours before it stopped raining Tuesday.\nWhile much of the western part of the state received its fair share of the rainfall that took place earlier this week, it is expected that the heaviest rain will hit much closer to the city of Phoenix and the Phoenix Metropolitan area.","token_len":711,"entropy":[10.705,0.175,2.8271,9.5929,0.3434,1.3556,9.4255,1.7577,0.4107,0.7322,1.9221,9.4267,0.2335,0.0295,1.6883,2.0757,8.233,5.2379,1.7924,2.195,0.5766,1.2981,0.7932,7.9505,4.5085,0.0969,7.6621,1.1083,0.027,0.7662,4.1427,4.7328,0.0211,0.0017,0.0126,0.0019,0.4815,7.7063,4.5944,0.329,10.255,2.5048,8.6881,3.1442,2.1461,7.2176,0.3212,9.1999,1.6379,0.4068,0.9537,6.8959,7.8078,0.0784,1.6627,6.0026,4.4657,0.6051,0.7202,10.2548,5.9323,9.5335,6.2815,1.5547,2.9532,0.2149,0.1216,0.4253,9.3444,14.7951,2.9586,7.2762,0.6095,4.1912,4.657,4.9878,4.1729,2.2052,1.8191,1.365,1.7143,5.7635,5.1186,3.1286,3.2235,3.2108,7.8586,0.8041,4.4513,0.2092,3.4124,0.608,4.3928,2.9789,5.5246,3.2711,7.2927,0.1806,1.9769,0.0205,4.6831,3.5714,0.7885,0.5676,3.648,4.5456,0.7492,0.2203,4.1437,3.9413,3.4549,0.011,1.1056,6.3911,0.0137,1.6845,6.0589,0.036,2.8476,0.0569,8.0311,3.329,5.9381,0.3898,2.3594,0.2789,0.6839,0.5306,1.8197,5.4159,2.9486,0.2887,1.5742,1.5255,1.3165,2.1431,5.2217,4.3216,2.562,0.8871,1.6839,1.4191,6.0565,8.3968,1.334,7.8217,4.8929,0.172,0.866,0.4031,1.6881,3.7372,6.5695,0.0003,1.8946,4.9487,2.8359,5.0485,0.2227,4.5251,2.9488,0.0762,4.2764,2.1376,4.0792,3.0907,1.2074,0.1529,0.0017,0.5298,0.4281,5.0921,1.902,7.1744,0.4109,1.2713,3.445,0.4191,6.2996,7.3874,5.1007,0.8328,0.0416,0.0006,2.2196,2.6685,4.558,5.2485,3.096,5.1825,2.8653,3.0814,5.4792,4.175,0.8911,2.3643,5.2472,0.3774,0.3239,5.3974,5.5427,0.0037,4.2557,2.8192,0.5643,5.533,3.2264,5.0195,3.5049,6.5884,0.4573,1.7543,1.7855,4.6493,0.0865,3.8353,0.3453,3.892,3.8602,3.5637,1.8753,0.5894,0.943,5.4226,4.3919,4.9192,2.9384,0.9181,2.195,3.0169,1.1728,0.0081,2.1134,1.1045,4.0688,3.8861,6.5624,3.0453,2.5982,0.3278,3.5069,4.1473,4.6654,5.6924,0.4102,0.9478,4.4969,0.0092,3.7365,0.3273,4.1928,5.131,5.2967,7.8614,0.759,2.1864,5.1928,0.5326,1.5275,8.1794,0.0246,5.9384,4.1168,5.4034,1.357,3.9848,2.1827,3.6612,0.0014,5.3923,0.2998,3.1675,4.0201,0.7301,2.0744,1.353,5.7273,2.5691,6.7275,2.4841,1.552,0.0179,7.0401,0.3327,1.0162,4.8188,1.8792,5.1038,1.8181,1.1495,2.1163,4.5422,0.3661,0.3023,5.1878,1.4639,0.0207,0.2831,0.726,0.0013,2.9167,6.7627,0.7462,4.6844,5.088,0.0073,3.9583,2.8988,0.9718,1.9473,8.0517,1.654,3.6015,2.0831,5.6146,7.408,1.734,6.7002,6.7721,3.0194,1.4176,3.1371,3.5601,0.6514,0.7326,1.5487,1.2021,3.3741,0.5336,5.8227,0.7428,1.4205,3.2649,1.1943,3.9702,3.1611,1.4197,1.2086,6.1227,4.3427,0.142,3.0044,8.545,4.2332,0.3614,6.4391,0.901,3.0836,0.9333,4.4329,11.7046,1.6667,0.0015,2.4857,4.9859,5.4885,4.9462,1.1274,1.9895,2.149,3.202,0.001,0.0036,0.0109,1.8498,0.7204,0.0004,0.1164,0.3476,0.4939,3.0399,4.5192,0.0056,4.3345,1.1119,5.8865,2.4795,1.6281,2.017,0.5843,0.7467,0.4529,1.2379,9.5708,1.3549,1.6971,3.9641,0.2327,1.9175,2.8927,8.0792,2.5369,3.8979,0.1337,6.0088,1.5393,0.6687,9.371,0.0083,1.2423,4.8519,2.071,4.9933,0.0097,7.2691,1.5762,3.3588,1.5692,4.1296,0.1841,10.8475,5.8066,5.678,1.8896,3.6165,2.7804,5.7884,0.0743,0.7236,0.687,2.5922,5.3499,3.8665,1.7331,5.9824,3.3706,0.0042,4.1648,0.0896,0.865,3.2976,2.1704,0.0016,0.069,8.5986,0.5421,0.4953,5.1915,0.229,4.1167,5.6386,0.1934,0.0749,4.9455,1.6752,1.0471,1.2813,4.3469,0.0147,1.0656,2.6395,6.6871,2.949,0.0044,2.6546,4.2835,5.5481,0.7447,4.3684,4.0949,1.3403,2.8817,5.8334,6.8731,2.0157,4.6645,1.5162,1.8674,3.5909,1.7205,0.104,4.452,2.668,0.1145,0.456,2.8,3.1515,1.3963,1.9474,0.9149,0.7501,3.9367,5.6815,1.9653,6.3999,0.6657,8.7767,2.6974,0.0191,4.2676,0.0629,2.2163,4.1921,2.1044,1.4512,4.1438,2.2014,2.7578,3.1187,0.6283,0.1966,0.3232,1.4663,5.1049,0.0289,0.0017,1.9166,0.0738,7.3236,3.1545,0.1396,4.3367,1.6393,1.3005,0.6237,3.9165,4.6768,0.2234,2.4729,3.1571,1.811,0.0676,0.7676,1.14,5.4996,1.3271,8.0525,4.8619,1.9468,4.8276,0.0006,0.2281,0.6823,7.8193,1.2893,3.7228,4.2397,0.0973,0.6026,0.4641,1.719,1.5622,1.7665,0.0144,1.4707,8.0725,0.0016,1.386,4.7988,6.8014,3.2795,3.008,0.408,1.1844,4.0091,3.6046,0.2813,1.1688,6.0078,1.0178,1.0961,1.0006,1.1461,0.887,5.8817,1.3741,5.647,5.6105,1.8811,2.2754,4.4137,3.0193,1.2685,2.6665,0.6637,0.0417,1.1074,4.6476,6.8243,0.5682,0.3041,0.1473,7.1134,0.0027,2.1051,3.1048,3.5777,3.6487,3.2426,7.0315,1.3453,2.3397,1.8268,2.6292,0.0079,2.0192,1.6803,4.3674,2.4276,2.2524,6.1403,0.0124,0.5774,2.0432,1.9241,3.8001,1.6611,5.481,0.472,4.2934,1.0835,2.5792,3.4258,0.7157,3.2653,0.1058,0.6273,2.4083,5.5831,1.0309,4.8753,1.6542,0.0384,0.6382,1.0909,0.4185,1.6364,5.48,0.1192,5.479,3.4248,3.8635,0.4409,4.7953,2.0809,10.3621,0.9326,0.3393,3.4181,0.29,5.8945,1.8964,2.0971,1.6717,3.509,5.5757,3.3474,4.4199,3.4602,0.2003,3.5902,0.0373,1.0366,0.6752,1.8441,0.7524,7.5584,0.0612,2.691,2.9984,6.0675,3.8183,4.6416,0.7123,0.6439,5.2988,4.8012,0.0483,0.3308,4.2268,1.8314,0.0055,0.4103,0.3475,4.1575,4.6556,5.5197,0.0562,0.0077,3.2474,2.6743,3.8949,6.3091,0.4568,4.0693,1.2942,0.8086,0.1133,2.7332,2.2453,1.491,1.43,1.7588,3.2601,1.7621,0.9805,2.3271,4.2784,4.8515,0.0483,0.6829,4.8463,0.1454,2.2933,2.6063,1.4646,3.9893,5.9602,1.4905,0.9667]}

This is generally regarded as too dim to be seen with the","text":"When Ceres has an opposition near the perihelion, it can reach a visual magnitude of + 6 @. @ 7. This is generally regarded as too dim to be seen with the naked eye. I n this case the opposition takes place a t 0h 11m 54sec.0 and the perihelion a t 22h 48m 18sec.2.\nThe observations may again be divided into two groups -Group I. a t opposition -Group II. a t perihelion.\nWhen the opposition of Ceres is in the form of an apparent conjunction or conjunction with another comet, the effect depends upon many circumstances.\nIt is not always possible to distinguish by ordinary means whether the opposition itself has produced any effect upon the behaviour of the comet, so that it is sometimes necessary to combine the observations for both opposition and perihelion.\nA simple comparison of the observations, both as regards the behaviour of the comet and the direction or velocity of the motion of the apparent centre, would give no clue.\nI t is only when the motion of the comet appears to be in a definite direction, and when this direction can be determined with much accuracy, that the opposition may be recognised.\nIn the present case there was so marked a tendency that when the opposition arrived the apparent centre was near to the comet, and apparently near to the comet also in the hours of high illumination immediately preceding the opposition.\nThe opposition itself took place with great rapidity ; and as previously observed, it followed closely the minimum of the brightness of the comet, and appeared to come on gradually from the neighbourhood of the nucleus.\nThe comet continued to show a high rate of rise to perihelion and also of recession from it ; it reached a maximum in the region of the perihelion an hour before the opposition.\nThe comet continued to make great oscillations, and reached the minimum of its apparent diameter an hour before the minimum of brightness.\nI t continued to show large oscillations throughout the opposition, during which time its magnitude appeared to remain relatively constant a t about + 6, and it is likely that this was the general character of the observations throughout the opposition.\nAs it reached the perihelion it increased rapidly, and showed very irregular motion during the interval between the minimum and the maximum of illumination.\nAt the beginning of the following day, February 29, at the time when the comet reached its perihelion, its maximum seemed to be attained about the hour of a. m. ( 7h 40m 40sec.\n).\nThe light of the comet diminished during July to a minimum, when it was between + 3 and + 4, at the time when it was at its greatest distance from the Sun.\nIt gradually increased in brightness, and by the middle of August it had again approached the Sun.\nAt the end of August its maximum appeared to be about + 1 and was continued until the end of the month, when it was + 2.\nThe light of the comet showed little variation during the last stage of the opposition.\nIt appears, therefore, from the observations of the comet that it had not undergone any important change of

Unable to find work due to his physical appearance, Merrick ended up in a mad-house and eventually died. Norman began to visit his home regularly, noticing that he seemed to have more insight into the life of others than he should have.\nHe often spent time with Merrick, helping to raise money for the hospital and the cause of reform. While visiting Merrick, Norman met with some of Merrick's friends, observing them and their behaviour. He noted that many of the people at the mental asylum had poor hygiene and were living in filthy conditions. This helped to inspire Norman into making a new plan for reforming the lives of the inmates. Norman wanted to set a new standard for hygiene, with the aim to make men and women clean, well groomed and clean clothing. It was also important to have regular work, free food and freedom. Norman began to write a report regarding the hygiene of the mental asylum and sent it to the Home Office. He also requested funding for a new mental asylum hospital to care for the men at the asylum. Later that year, the New Reform Asylum was opened and Norman became its first director. With this, Norman and the members of the reform hospital were able to free prisoners from prisons, reform young men, and help reform patients from the asylum. These reforms proved successful and the New Reform Asylum had become the best place for patients with mental illness anywhere in the world.\nHowever, Norman was not happy with the success of the New Reform Asylum and wanted to find a way to improve the conditions at the asylum and help the mentally ill, but was unable to work within the confines of the Home Office. Norman and his wife had to close down the New Reform Asylum, not due to any failure of the foundation, but because they were unable to receive the funding their plans required. Shortly after this, he was approached by the Royal College of Physicians of Glasgow as the new head of mental hygiene at the College. With this, he was able to work with the Ministry of Health and the government, attempting to improve the lives of the mentally ill. This led Norman in the establishment of the Mental Asylum Research Fund and he became a trustee of the Fund. Norman was able to improve the lives of the mentally ill by improving sanitation and helping inmates to gain employment, but Norman hoped to see improvements to the asylum itself.\nThe New Reform found a happy and successful place within the society, but only until it was forced to close. However, some of the ideas from Norman's report are still being used when trying to rehabilitate mentally ill people into society. Norman is thought to have made a significant contribution to the understanding of mental illness, and to have improved the understanding of hygiene. He is also credited with improving the prison conditions at the British Empire Asylum. Norman also developed a technique called the'social contract'with his followers, which he used to explain the benefits of certain practices and ideas that were being used to improve the lives of the mentally ill.\nThroughout his life, Norman began to spend more time travelling around the world, and in 1894, he retired and was succeeded by Dr Norman Thomas.

He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the Tribune office went in an ambulance with his father to an emergency hospital. His father, the president of the union, asked whether he had been hit by a bomb. When he was told that no bomb was found, he said: \u2018They have destroyed my house. Now I do not have a home. \u2018When the news appeared that the Union Labor Party had lost three of its four national executive seats, a meeting of workers went to his house to support the union in the face of those who said they had already beaten it.\nGreeley took his seat at the Tribune in October and was soon made the leader of the opposition to Blaine and Fremont. He was again a candidate at Colorado, Iowa and Michigan \u2013 but this time failed. After his defeat a little band of friends, including his father, went to his house. \u2018They were my last group when I went into hospital at Bellevue. \u2018I was a little out of sorts, as you know, after having lost the election, and I had a big argument with some of the party workers \u2013 and my father kept his temper very well that afternoon.\n\u2018In order to make it more interesting for the men, he got up and walked out across the room. \u2018They were so angry that my father gave the final blow to his enemy. \u2018And at that he was made a candidate by the union for election as a representative to the National convention of the new United States\u2019 Labor Party.\nHe was elected to Congress, and in spite of the opposition of Roosevelt ( who thought he was a radical ) helped to carry out the labor reforms that were then urgently needed. The strike at the Brooklyn Docks was being watched by government agents, and in 1904 he gave it his attention. Although the strike went on, he had a high opinion of it and when at once, he and a few friends turned their attention to it. They were received by the Governor and asked whether they would help. He agreed, and sent them letters to the dock workers showing how much sympathy he and his family had for the strike. So that the New York Times, commenting on the case in the same column, wrote:\n\u2018To some extent the labor question has been a handicap to its opponents \u2026 The strike at the Brooklyn docks is one of the most striking of recent times. It is a great step towards better conditions for the men.\n\u2018What more, Mr. Greeley and his friends did was to help to prevent the men from going to work on the Sunday. In fact we found them sitting by the canal, outside the Union hall, making plans for their next strike, and working out the details of a plan. But these leaders were not allowed to do much against the Government.\n\u2018They did however have about four hundred followers to help them out by distributing bad notices. \u2018They were even given some money to turn loose bad notice, and we think they were very successful. \u2018From the results of this strike there would not have been much if it had not been for that. \u2018They obtained a union of their own and are now getting more and more influential, and if at the election all goes well with the workers we may see labormen getting to vote in the next Presidential

{"prompt":"Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first @ - @ place finish in Corus group C in 2004 . His shared first place with Alexander < unk >","text":"Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first @ - @ place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander < unk > Ponomariov gave them both the first place in the tie-breakers for a full entry into the corus group D for that year, where they were eliminated by their opponents Karjakin and Gligoric in the first round.\nCarlsen had very little success in Grand Prix tournaments before, although he reached the semi-finals in St. Petersburg 2005, and his first win in one was in the first edition of the World Rapid Chess Championship in 2006. In 2007, Carlsen reached the semifinals at the Memorial Rubin Linde in Israel, with his first full Grand Prix victory coming at the inaugural St. Louis tournament, where he lost only once in 11 games. He finished second in the St. Louis 2008 tournament, the same position reached at the inaugural World Champion Chess event in Los Angeles. He had another good result at the World Cup Grand Prix in Baku, finishing second to Giri. He won the Wijk aan Zee tournament in 2009 with a 7-2 record.\nCarlsen claimed victory by 4\u00bd points at the first edition of the Candidates Series in 2010 and reached the final in the Corus B tournament the year before. In 2012, he beat FIDE world champion Magnus Carlsen in a very dramatic match, with only four moves left, at the Tata Steel Chess. He finished third in the next edition, losing in the semi-final against Anand. After finishing the 2013 tournament with a 2\u00bd point loss to the world champion, Carlsen became the reigning World Chess Champion through a draw in the tiebreak of the 2014 World Championship in London, thus qualifying for the Candidates series for the first time in his career. He faced and lost to Levon Aronian in the Semis, but was awarded the prize for winning the Grand Chess Tour 2014 for finishing second overall, thus obtaining the first place in the ranking.\nCarlsen's success in the Candidates and Grand Prix events of the year 2014 led to the world chess rating of 2667 and the highest rated player ever as of April 2014. In January 2015, Carlsen achieved the world championship match rating of 2700 Elo after finishing first in the Tata Steel Chess 2015, thus securing a wild-card entry into the 2015 FIDE World Chess Championship, the only world champion to hold the title after his final Grand Chess Tour event. At the 2015 World Championship, Carlsen defeated World Champion Magnus Carlsen for the first time since October 2014. Though the two began the match in equal parts, Carlsen eventually won the match with the white pieces. Carlsen defended his FIDE world championship title the following November 2018 in a match with Magnus Carlsen, which they won, becoming the first to win two world championships in a row.\nThe White King's Gambit, a new opening invented by Carlsen in 2008, is one of the most popular of his defenses. It is a positional game in which the opponent will attempt to capture by way of the e-pawn or, alternatively, move the pawn to a critical location where another piece can capture the pawn.

{"prompt":"The exact origin of the Hinomaru is unknown , but the rising sun seems to have had some symbolic meaning since the early 7th century ( the Japanese archipelago is east of the Asian mainland","text":"The exact origin of the Hinomaru is unknown, but the rising sun seems to have had some symbolic meaning since the early 7th century ( the Japanese archipelago is east of the Asian mainland and is facing towards the solar disk at its equator, so the rising sun would take place in the early morning ).\n( 3 ) \" the Sun Eaters'Festival \", a festival of eating and drinking at the start of the year on February 2.It is probably related to the Sun God, whose festival was celebrated on February 9.\n( the Sun is seen as a food source in Buddhist teachings and in the Chinese almanac ( a similar festival takes place on January 7, with the eating of lotus flowers ).\n( 4 ) the Ashura festival on October 16 ( there are many different reasons for why people might choose to remember the dead and remember them with funerals and funeral rituals, but all seem to depend upon religion ).The year 1052 marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Susa K\u014db\u014d, a great scholar and statesman who was the mentor of the seventh century's \" Three Great Scholars \", known as the \" San'in School \".\nIn addition to the historical events discussed above, the year 1052 saw other major achievements :\n- In 1052, Japan started to expand its empire through Asia, and conquered Ky\u016bsh\u016b ( the island \" of the sun \" - see page 16 ).\n- In 1052, Japan was also the first country to launch commercial and cultural relations with the United States.\n- In 1052, Japan also started trade relations with China under the name of Kamakura or K\u014dka.\nThis was the first time the terms Japan and China were used in a diplomatic context.\n- In 1052, Japan also began to use the term \" people of Japan \" instead of using Japan as an alternative name for Japan.\n- In 1052, Japan and China established a treaty stipulating that when the Japanese ambassador was to China, the Chinese ambassador was to the Mikado of Japan.This treaty lasted until 1234, and although it was a very important event in diplomatic and political terms, it hardly had any effects on ordinary living within the country.\n- In 1054, two Japanese explorers set sail from Sh\u016bshuku ( Okinawa ) - the first to sail the East sea.\n- In 1055, the emperor commissioned another Japanese explorer in search of some new islands off the coast of Ky\u016bsh\u016b and Kii ( these islands were discovered and named the Ch\u016bnan Islands ).The explorer came back to Japan in 1056 after two years and described them as two huge land masses separated by the Sea.\n- In 1058, Japan was struck by a massive earthquake.The emperor immediately ordered a huge effort to rebuild the city of K\u014dbe which was devastated by the earthquake.\n- In 1058, the Japanese Emperor ordered the construction of six city walls and castles around the imperial complex in Nara, the capital of Japan.\n- In 1059, the Japanese emperor commissioned a second exploration of the East sea by the Sh\u016bka, along the same line

They carried twelve 10 @. @ 5 cm SK L \/ 45 guns in single pedestal mounts. The gunnery system was based on the Sicheritatsystem of the Hamburg-based class. One SK L \/ 45 gun was located below each middeck bridge aft and two others above the bridge in a pentagonal arrangement. To increase the speed of the boat in rough water and at close range, the guns were aimed by an electro-optical gun sights, while the main guns on other ships of the class were aimed by an optical sight and a movable trunnion. The torpedo tubes were located amidships, protected by two anti-torpedo bulkheads in the hull. The cruisers carried fifteen 14. 7 @ 5 cm SK L \/ 45 tubes in single mounts ( nine superfiring dual tubes ) for anti-aircraft and torpedo service, including the one amidships firing two 2. 5 t torpedoes each. The other 14. 7 @ 5 cm tubes were only used for anti-aircraft service. The bow mounted 8. 2 @ 3 cm SK L \/ 35 guns could fire the newly developed German flak gun ammunition and were protected by anti-smoking nets. The eight 3. 2 @ 75 mm SP \/ 36 guns could fire the same ammunition. The cruiser classes were equipped with four 0. 7 @ 10 cm SK C \/ 40 torpedo tubes in the bow ( one under each bridge ) and with six 8. 0 @ 250 m m torpedo tubes in twin mounts amidships ( four under the bridge and two amidships ), while the four 8. 0 @ 250 m m tubes on the older Magdeburg class were replaced on the newer class by two 8. 0 @ 250 m m torpedo tubes in twin mounts amidships.\nThe speed was increased to 32 knots. and the distance from Germany to Malta was cut in half, to just 750 kilometres.\nThe three cruisers of this class were lost during the Second World War ; Karlsruhe was sunk by U - B - 51 on 16 February 1943 while returning from Malta, and Rostock on 1 November 1943 by U - B - 51 during a convoy escort operation in the western North Sea.\nFor two years after war end they were converted into cruisers for training and testing purposes.\nThe U - B - 51 was sunk by depth charges in May 1944 in the English Channel while escorting the cruiser Pomerania from Trondheim to Gothenburg in the Swedish Arctic.\nAs with the other cruiser classes, the class was not replaced until the outbreak of hostilities in 1939. The Pomerania and the remaining two cruisers were repainted as coastal or liner escorts, and the new ships were named Wismar and Bremerhaven.\nAfter the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939, cruiser classes 4, 5 and 6 were withdrawn.\nThe only cruisers of these cruiser classes surviving are three ships named Berlin, Prague and Copenhagen.\nDuring the Second World War, these three cruisers

During the 6th century BCE, Greek geographer Scylax told of a harbor of Phaselis. The city was an important port used by Phoenicians and Carthaginians. On November 2, 1212 the Venetians arrived at Tell Abu. Later in the month, the city was captured by the Crusaders from the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1217, during David of Edessa's campaign against the Arabs, the town was besieged two times, first by Tancred of Hauteville and then besieged by Simon IV of Montferrat.\nThe town was re-established by the Crusader Empire. A port of Tyre was built adjacent to Tell Abu, where the port is still active. At the beginning of the 14th century, Tell Abu was one of the three ports on the coast of Eastern Anatolia as a destination port for Persian and Arab traders. It was an important naval military harbor and was under the control of the Crusaders. In 1429, Sultan Mohammed Bayezid I took control of the city by force and forced the Crusaders to pay taxes. In 1435, the city was taken by Crusader troops. It was then a Muslim city called Abu.\nIn 1520 and 1522 the town was besieged by Ottoman troops, but it was not incorporated into the Turkish Empire until 1538.\nIn 1930, Tell Abu was officially incorporated to Turkey after the British left the region, since the United Kingdom has been the owner of the region due to the Anglo-Bahren accord of 1918 and has ruled the region as the British mandate of Palestine. In 1941, during World War II, Tell Abu was captured by British troops and taken under Ottoman administration for four years, and in 1941 was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire for a year, before the Allied Forces took control of the region in 1944.\nIn 1954, the village underwent a change in administration, since the British occupation returned to its territory. Under British administration Tell Abu became an export processing zone, until 1967 the British divided it into five separate administrative districts, each under the control of one of the administrative districts of British Mandate Palestine. In 1967, following the Six Day War, the whole of Mandate Palestine was partitioned into a number of states on a line drawn between the Suez and Euphrates Rivers. Tell Abu became part of the West Bank, which was under Jordanian rule.\nIn 1974 following the War of Succession, the West Bank was administered as part of a temporary ceasefire agreement implemented as the Israeli-Egyptian Agreement. This temporary ceasefire lasted for a few months and was implemented in part to accommodate the Palestinian resistance and in part to prepare for a permanent ceasefire which had already been prepared and was signed by Israel and Syria. In 1974, the West Bank was divided into three separate Palestinian areas, which were to constitute a unified Palestinian State under the leadership of an elected Palestinian President. All of the East Bank was split into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In addition, East Jerusalem became a Palestinian capital from which its Palestinian Arab citizens would be able to vote for their President and Prime Minister.\nFollowing the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1988 and the formation of a national Palestinian government in 1993, West Bank residents voted for the Palestinian representation. In 1994, following the Oslo Accords, the West Bank became separate administrative divisions consisting of the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as a Palestinian Area administrating Palestinian refugees.","token_len":717,"entropy":[7.5906,7.9413,4.5268,4.1227,6.902,0.6509,8.5823,9.1497,12.3768,11.0463,5.7666,4.8597,4.7995,3.3612,14.7863,5.2084,0.0532,2.7508,7.3442,3.6426,1.4819,2.0495,2.1473,5.0924,0.9894,4.3924,0.1441,0.4811,0.3919,1.0974,7.8907,7.1624,1.783,8.6845,4.3792,3.4899,5.7252,1.0977,1.1847,8.6174,2.4219,4.2327,6.3213,2.4129,3.1595,2.0045,2.2435,0.8433,5.1259,0.7874,2.5521,8.6645,0.4649,4.4343,1.3921,0.2237,1.883,5.9857,0.0041,0.021,1.4408,5.2958,5.4797,3.5224,0.2002,3.2035,4.2904,5.1113,6.7935,0.0111,0.7703,4.9811,1.9519,0.3247,0.3042,2.0259,4.7519,2.2202,0.3689,5.4996,0.9099,1.292,3.8561,0.5711,3.8996,0.1966,0.6092,8.7962,0.0929,3.9488,1.5162,6.85,4.3627,1.0831,4.2561,0.5169,3.2487,1.0573,3.8745,1.1399,5.4763,10.6411,6.0124,6.5858,1.2569,0.2319,3.983,0.776,0.5571,3.8629,0.4357,1.2222,5.0146,0.4525,3.3929,9.0347,1.7072,2.5494,3.2903,0.2315,6.616,7.5615,0.0282,5.0879,6.6278,6.4791,6.6997,0.88,1.151,6.4872,0.8975,9.4019,6.3338,0.7114,5.7042,5.3418,0.098,0.6409,2.7832,5.3502,3.6531,0.9081,5.2738,0.5477,1.181,1.876,0.8916,6.0494,4.3341,3.4142,4.4112,6.0505,3.0385,6.008,0.2941,0.9238,1.1776,5.8756,0.0701,1.1084,0.0695,1.8346,3.9429,1.2781,4.4433,3.9105,2.1152,3.244,1.3352,4.6446,1.0157,2.7891,0.0167,0.206,2.5067,0.006,0.0374,0.8223,3.7415,0.0675,0.5632,3.7723,0.0076,0.1972,4.5274,4.0615,3.9069,0.4722,3.241,0.2055,6.7357,4.0389,0.0012,6.3566,2.4111,6.4611,3.8974,0.9918,5.0693,2.7465,3.5864,1.2614,0.4159,2.5636,0.6921,4.422,0.1006,4.6432,8.0089,7.0127,2.081,2.2665,6.1453,0.8388,0.6621,0.0216,0.7082,4.9415,0.0403,0.7004,2.7959,2.9777,4.7314,0.4541,5.6103,5.2805,7.977,4.2639,4.4235,3.7861,4.3462,1.3696,0.1247,0.5217,1.9152,3.8103,1.7106,1.5171,4.7091,0.8311,4.2905,0.0046,0.285,4.5963,4.2748,1.4357,2.5438,0.6315,3.0637,0.2805,1.0136,1.7047,0.2733,3.3144,1.1287,8.8122,3.2402,2.08,3.5131,0.6287,3.2485,5.9878,5.4154,1.5182,4.6206,3.7971,3.1813,1.5184,2.7078,2.7582,3.4337,5.4848,0.3733,2.9491,2.2502,3.1721,0.4447,3.8347,0.3413,4.692,1.9156,2.1526,2.5014,2.2248,0.5348,2.202,7.4293,0.4737,0.4459,3.5493,0.3303,0.6057,1.6097,4.1123,0.3827,2.4035,2.0233,9.3546,0.563,2.8661,0.0253,0.3108,4.8055,1.9648,4.9683,2.7674,3.9674,1.017,4.7839,5.6829,1.341,3.9686,3.2607,6.1385,1.4011,7.0267,0.1036,4.1558,2.1074,3.0164,6.3359,0.2341,0.7744,4.13,8.0327,0.0162,1.2356,5.3682,0.0695,11.4344,9.4953,15.0589,3.5928,4.3777,2.961,5.0695,5.9046,1.6528,1.2656,4.8509,2.3128,2.4046,6.1918,3.8394,4.5007,0.7901,2.4348,4.2425,0.3864,4.8498,3.3911,0.0067,0.1262,0.1794,2.2131,0.0081,0.3479,3.5948,0.2625,3.2321,2.0102,1.6606,2.5833,4.8638,1.7084,5.389,3.9967,6.0407,0.5562,2.5506,2.8215,2.9012,4.067,3.2097,3.5625,0.6659,0.629,0.5843,0.2212,3.3135,2.5794,2.9201,2.4692,2.9318,1.8331,4.9579,5.0684,3.0175,0.9246,0.5256,0.5963,1.2922,1.7987,2.0502,0.1512,0.8698,1.5432,4.2593,0.3202,1.3048,6.536,8.3738,0.9619,4.4536,2.5268,4.6083,1.6903,3.1986,1.025,2.0683,5.091,7.2752,1.3186,3.258,3.4976,0.9986,6.125,2.0102,4.5923,5.8368,0.0134,1.5437,2.3652,8.1142,7.7401,5.1332,1.7042,5.5492,4.5701,3.0174,4.0931,8.5059,1.9971,0.5118,3.1846,3.2327,4.7517,2.5504,1.3757,2.0545,4.1812,1.2835,0.8584,0.0214,3.1349,2.0122,0.379,7.2573,2.0879,2.2737,3.9643,4.5531,0.0141,2.6929,0.4263,1.6365,1.7459,0.4449,6.0419,0.6467,6.0151,0.9172,0.0835,0.5859,0.9788,6.1192,1.2989,7.9225,0.0007,0.0236,0.4049,4.0028,0.002,0.7439,4.0176,4.9171,0.0051,5.4821,5.9981,2.2874,5.2332,1.4826,3.4198,1.1887,8.262,0.4007,4.2771,3.9456,0.0001,1.6521,0.5993,5.1621,0.0064,1.8699,2.0352,0.0028,0.5219,5.7846,0.0204,2.1923,3.1462,1.3711,3.1024,2.9592,2.5107,1.568,1.0119,0.9299,3.4759,9.2515,0.3379,5.9881,0.3826,7.6428,0.0069,0.5851,1.0208,5.3576,0.0042,0.7612,6.8099,2.6677,1.9603,0.0013,2.9108,6.3706,4.014,2.1109,7.8038,5.0576,3.72,3.5128,1.7563,2.933,0.0124,5.2593,1.3394,3.4723,5.1248,0.4031,4.0228,0.9751,2.9049,2.2445,1.0817,1.9042,1.8017,3.8146,1.6231,4.8541,2.11,5.3813,0.5497,2.91,3.8465,2.846,4.6978,0.1518,0.189,5.6476,0.9292,2.1175,5.5634,1.7015,5.2144,4.0817,2.6322,0.5954,6.056,3.4002,2.6851,4.998,0.9526,2.1257,0.9494,5.5802,0.5474,1.8689,3.5932,0.4825,1.1972,2.9071,0.0058,0.5392,2.1599,0.1013,1.7862,2.4496,4.4912,3.1127,1.1093,2.9459,0.889,3.9586,6.5987,1.3305,4.5387,0.9561,2.4568,2.27,0.8708,3.6995,0.0339,4.4258,2.7783,0.7087,2.7881,0.7013,5.548,1.4409,0.5126,4.7041,2.2218,1.5662,4.8805,0.2299,2.9079,3.1232,0.0753,0.9006,0.3603,0.2881,0.0033,0.9134,1.8083,3.8164,0.6154,4.8262,0.2547,4.0425,1.9501,1.4347,3.4478,5.5008,3.0692,5.6729,3.824,5.7126,2.1233,1.9379,0.9864,1.0352,0.0061,3.4323,2.2105,1.8521,6.5348,2.3108,6.343,0.0304,0.5089,0.8484,5.2816,0.2413,3.4651,0.0255,0.4315,1.2936,0.3666,0.5298,4.3901,3.5617,0.7658,4.3665,0.0049,1.7185,5.2756,1.0177,1.953,0.5317,2.3088,0.0867,5.2907,0.0067,3.0363,4.4215,1.1851,1.112,1.7822,7.2711,4.2228,1.5073,2.1531,0.2971,5.055,0.3788,2.8327,0.3509,0.0,0.43,0.8409,1.7598,0.0032,2.1088,6.5194,4.9302,6.1979,6.3917,0.1656,1.628,1.0714,0.0103,0.9716,5.1196,1.6147,3.0357,0.1576,0.0037,3.3433,1.2207,6.1671,8.3639,4.7005,4.5099,5.4207,0.9082]}

He","text":"Due to Disston's purchase, the IIF was able to sponsor railroad projects, and the opportunity presented itself when oil tycoon Henry Flagler became enchanted with St. Augustine during a vacation. He hired Disston to design the new town on land he bought, at the tip of North St. In the 1890s, St. Augustine attracted people who liked nature, art, and architecture. The town incorporated in 1895 and became the oldest incorporated city in the United States.\nDisston helped develop the railroad by studying railroad maps. Many bridges were built to cross the marshes and mangroves of the river. In addition, one or more bridges were built over each river on the route, some as long as 150 feet. The two oldest bridges are the one crossing Creek Bridge and the one across the river to Old Spanish Wells. The bridge to Old Spanish Wells used the oldest method for crossing a bridge, the ferry, which aided the ferrymen who sold boat trips from the upper part of Creek Bridge up to Old Spanish Wells. The old bridges suffered from floods and heavy rains. They collapsed in 1926, but were replaced in 1928 by the current bridges. In 1949, a bridge that crossed Creek Bridge collapsed. It was replaced in 1952.\nThe old houses that Disston designed in the early 1900s have remained in places to which they belonged, and are owned by the St. Augustine Historic District Commission. Each building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Most have been restored and renovated in recent years, but one example still has many original features.\nOne house, a former log cabin now rebuilt with steel and stone, has a stone foundation with a clay lath roof. A large living room with a fireplace and a bay window overlooks the wetlands from several levels of porch. The rear of the house includes a two-story gallery with a sloped roof. It has a large veranda with French doors to the front. The original chimneys are still intact. The home has recently been decorated and used as rentals. The home overlooks the marshland along the north bank of the Tallahatchie River, which is one of the most beautiful places in the world.\nAnother house at the southern end of the Historic District is a brick house. It has brick stucco walls. This home has three bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen. It has stone foundations with a clay lath roof. Its front has a porch supported by columns of brick. A large living room with a fireplace contains bay windows and doors looking out to the river. The front door is above ground, with its hinges on the outside. The doors are original, as are many windows. The home was remodeled in the 1970s, but restored to the design it had in the 1970s. It still has original features such as the wood floors and the original chimney.\nDisston also designed the Old Spanish Wells Hotel, the oldest hotel in the United States. The hotel opened to the public in 1901.\nDisston was also involved in many of the landmarks in St. Augustine, and especially in the homes built by wealthy landowners.\nDisston received the honor of the National Medal of Architecture. His buildings became historical landmarks in St. Augustine.\nThe old St. Augustine was plagued by flooding, and many houses were flooded by the river.

He appeared in the British historical series, where he starred as the Duke of Wellington.\nOther appearances from the 1960s included The New York Times ( 1962), the British television series The Thatcher Years ( 1987), the documentary Hollywood in the Fifties ( 1988), and an Emmy Award for the documentary Richard Gere ( 1989 ).

He also ordered an entirely new art department, with David Mazzuchelli as head of newcomers ; a first step towards his own independent art direction.\nWrzos also gave the newly established Fantastic the first of eight one-page superheroes, with the title \" Mr. X \".\nHis vision of Amazing as the comic of the world made it a great success, selling more than one million copies in its first two years from 1978 to 1980. The Amazing Spider-Man comic is by far the biggest seller of any Spider-Man movie. Iron Man was a success as well, despite critics who accused Marvel of cheating and underbidding DC to get them the rights to the character.\nIron Man and the X-Men were two successes that marked the beginning of Marvel Comics as a publishing entity, independent of DC Comics. In 1978, Marvel acquired Titan Comics, a comic book publisher that was also known for Marvel Comics \" first X-Men comic, Fascination Street. \" Marvel now owned the rights to the X-Men. With the acquisition Titan, Marvel became one of the largest book publishers in America, with approximately $ 2 billion in annual sales.\nMarvel Comics published a number of graphic novels and graphic novels on the superhero books, including the first X-Men saga, by Bryan Hitch, published between 1975 and 1977. In 1994 the series was rereleased with new covers and an unlisted, fourth- and fifth - volume box set. Marvel has also published a series with more than 1,100 pages and four graphic novels titled the Fantastic Four. In addition, most of Marvel's recent hero projects include both graphic novels and print editions.\nAs in DC, many other publishers had graphic novels and graphic novels on the superheroes.\nThe publishing of comic books on the superhero comic is still very popular, especially because of the popularity of superhero flicks and comic strips that are usually made of superhero comics.\nAlthough there had been many graphic novels with superhero storylines, most graphic novels had taken the character of Spider-Man, and more rarely superheroes were featured.\nIn the late 1960s, many superhero magazines were published by publishers and libraries of comic book publishers. The only serious competition from graphic novels was the publication of classic superhero comics, which was in no hurry to make the transition to graphics. Many companies stopped publishing superhero comics, while others still kept them. Most importantly it, comic companies gave graphic novels and comic strips the same treatment as superhero comics. Although graphic novels and comic strips became successful as a genre, even after the publication of graphic novels and comic strips, they were unable to break away from the confines of the comics medium.\nThe graphic novels could not take advantage of the popular superhero image, and could easily be classified as adult graphic novels.\nFrom the beginning of the second half of the 20th century comic book publishers were constantly looking for ways to expand their products, and the use of film was used as such.

Artists including","text":"In late 1967, an acetate of fourteen of Dylan's compositions was made, from which demos circulated among music groups who might be interested in recording some of the songs. Artists including the Beach Boys, Jimi Hendrix, and Buddy Holly were known to have heard demo recordings by Dylan before that time, but nobody had released any of Dylan's recordings. The Beach Boys, in particular, had hoped to record Dylan, and the group spent time in Dylan's studio in Memphis. In early 1968, the three-week sessions for Beach Boys'album Surf'n'Turf with Dylan were recorded. A few months later, Dylan recorded a number of solo tracks with the session artists as a part of his tour dates, while the Beach Boys were touring with The Eagles. Bob Dylan recorded a set of Dylan, a couple of Dylan songs were published only as demos, and more were later featured on the album Music From a Room.\nBob Dylan's biggest hit came in 1966 with Time of Our Lives. The album topped the U.S. and Canadian albums charts, as well as the Billboard 200. In Britain and France, the album hit the top twenty of the Top 100. For the U.K., Time of Our Lives was certified Gold by the BPI in September. In the UK, Time of Our Lives reached double platinum status after sales of 700,000 copies.\nTime of Our Lives was first licensed in the West as Time of My Life in September 1967, through a deal with the independent label MGM Records. The album was re-issued with the title Time of Our Lives and other songs featuring the title are also on the album. In 1979, Time of Our Lives was released in Japan, and was the most successful Dylan album in that country. The album had sold more than seven million copies.\nDylan's success continued with the release of Blood on the Tracks in 1967. Blood on the Tracks reached the top five of the Billboard 200, along with No direction home, and Blood on the Tracks, the first of his four albums to reach double platinum in the U.S. The band The Band covered Dylan's version of This Little Light of Mine in a single called This Little Light of Mine ( This Little Light of Mine ).\nIn December 1967, in Canada, Blood on the Tracks was certified Gold by the RPI, and the album was certified Platinum in the U.S. Three years later, in 1968, Blood on the Tracks was certified Platinum for sales of 2 million copies in the US. The track Time After Time is featured on the album Music From a Room.\nOther major hits were Slow Train Coming, a cover of Bob Dylan's song, released in October 1968, and the classic Bob Dylan song American Tango, released in November 1968. In the U.S., No Direction Home and Slow Train Coming were both certified Platinum by the RIAA in February 1969.\nThe album Slow Train Coming and his singles were recorded specifically for an EMI \/ CBS television special on the Vietnam War, and Bob Dylan spoke at length about the causes and the effects of the war. The album made its way to Japan, where Slow Train Coming was released commercially.\nIn November 1968, the BBC Radio One series The Art of Dylan was aired.

Six nations competed \u2014 Martin Tietze from Germany won both the men's and women's individual races.\nThe 1936 London Olympics began with the same ceremony as in previous Olympic Games, with athletes being welcomed by Queen Elizabeth II and a British Naval Band. As was customary at previous Olympics, a host of Olympic athletes arrived on Olympic Day, in the midst of a crowd of onlookers.\nThe 1936 Winter Olympics were the twelfth Summer Olympic Games of the modern Olympic era, also known as the \" silver medal era \" and the \" gold medal era \" before that. At the events of the year prior, 1936, the 1932 Winter Olympic Games, eight athletes from Italy had won seven medals, three gold, three silver and one bronze.\nCourses for the Winter Olympics are constructed as ski courses. One such course, used at the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics, was the Hahnenkamm course, a 9,000-meter circuit course located between Saalbach and Mittergaden at the foot of the Hahnenkamm mountain in Thun.\nNaval Air Service units from the US Naval Aviation Fleet used the Navy Lend-Lease Program to maintain their aircraft in service for the duration of the 1936 Summer Olympics. The US Coast Guard also performed maintenance and other duties for the fleet throughout the Games.\nOn 5 April 1936, the UK Olympic Committee had sent a letter to the IOC requesting that the 1936 Winter Olympics be held in the United Kingdom, instead of Germany. The letter, written as a result of anti-German and anti-Nazi sentiment in the UK, stated that the decision was due to the \" great prestige which an English-language Games entails. \"\nOn 12 April 1936, Italian press reported that the Mussolini government had agreed to the request of the British Olympic Committee (BOC) to hold the 1936 Summer Olympics in 1937 in the UK and not in Germany. In the late 1930s, the British were anxious over the possibility of Hitler's victory, and were fearful that if the British were to lose the sport's main event of that year, they could be blamed for the defeat of German athletes at the Olympics in Berlin in 1936.\nThe announcement of the Summer Games' postponement caused a great deal of anxiety in Britain, as the country was becoming increasingly nationalistic and the British Olympic Committee was keen to return to power after being out of influence since 1928. Some believed it was the result of British efforts to prevent a Nazi bid to the 1936 Games. The British Olympic Committee appealed to the Italian government in May 1936, requesting that the Games be held in the UK if Germany was unable to, but Italy refused, and this request was accepted by the United States Olympic Committee.\nThe decision to hold the Games in Germany in 1936 was controversial and some of the country's elite were aghast at the idea. The German Olympic Committee sent an official letter expressing the disappointment of the German people at the decision and stated that hosting the Games and the Olympics would cause serious political unrest in Germany, with the Germans being \" driven to extremism and to wars of the most violent kind. \"\nA report from the Institute of Contemporary Affairs claimed that the British Government \" intended to hold the 1936 Olympic games in London.

Excess capacity of","text":"The charter unit within Air Greenland is led by Hans Peter Hansen and employs 8 people, with 13 helicopters and 3 fixed @ - @ wing aircraft at its disposal. Excess capacity of the aircraft allows them to offer charters to both individual travelers and groups - from an intimate family reunion to large trade fairs and conferences. Air Greenland offers to travelers high quality services, with their main interest being for them to have a comfortable and relaxed journey, ensuring that their trip is enjoyable. The company also offers an extensive range of optional extras, such as food and drinks \u2013 including alcoholic drinks \u2013 and other services.\nChalenging, and sometimes dangerous work can be found in the fields and forests of Greenland. To protect themselves and the surroundings, the Greenlandic forest service uses helicopters on an extensive daily basis in order to manage forests and prevent forest fire.\nThe use of helicopters also comes at a very high use price. Air Greenland offers discounts to its customers due to long- standing contractual relationships with its partners.\nAt the helm of the Greenlandic Helicopter company are Helgi Aasland and Trygve Maren Lundqvist, with 3 helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft available for the customer. Helgi Aasland says that it is a great honor to be working with Air Greenland. \u201cWe will provide services according to the customer\u2019s needs, and we will work in collaboration with Air Greenland to ensure that the customer is satisfied.\u201d Helgi Aasland also notes that they will always strive to ensure that they are at the leading edge in terms of safety, and this applies more especially during the summer months. They state that they are willing to travel to the fields and farms of the remote parts of Greenland. \u201cWherever customers want us to go, we will be there.\u201d Helgi Aasland concludes.\nThe company is now expanding their fleet with a new fixed wing aircraft. \u201cWe are working with a large construction firm which is building a big house in an isolated village.\u201d says Kristian P.A. Aasland, co-owner of the Helicopter company.\u201cDue to transportation difficulties the house is being assembled by hand, with the help of a team of men from the village. In order to transport the heavy and long pieces of furniture, they were going to helicopter. Now we have a helicopter in the village of Qeqertarsuaq, which has a special workshop built in it for the accommodation and repair of helicopters. In this workshop, the equipment and tools needed for the refit service of the helicopter will be stored and kept on hand, in case it\u2019s needed for a scheduled maintenance and repair.\u201d\nIf the house is completed on time, this will be one more service offering the Helicopter company. \u201cWe are expanding our company\u2019s services in the region.\u201d says Kristian P.A. Aasland. He adds that Air Greenland is a reliable partner with extensive contacts in Greenlandic airports and shipping companies. \u201cWe will be able to provide customers with any service they need in the field.\u201d\nThe Helicopter company states that it has established a quality control system, which is based on ISO 9001 standards.

In the","text":"The C & SF established 470 @, @ 000 acres ( 1 @, @ 900 km2 ) for the Everglades Agricultural Area \u2014 27 percent of the Everglades before development. In the late 1890s an army of 3,000 people began clearing the Everglades in hopes of developing the land for farming. The army included 150 men from Fort Myers, Florida. It burned through the swamp to reach the soil to be ploughed. After clearing the earth on more than 100,000 acres, the Army Corps built roads for the farmers to travel by plow. A decade later, all the Everglades was cleared except for a few small swamps. The Everglades Agricultural Area is the area where agriculture is currently allowed. The Agriculture Department controls where agricultural activities are allowed. When the Army Corps was trying to clear the Everglades, they found that water would not flow out of the swamps easily. The water table is too deep. To develop agricultural land, water was pumped from another area to force water out of the soil (called \u201cwiping\u201d). This was expensive and often caused water pollution. The farmers had to pay a fee to buy water and to pump their water out of the Everglades. The Army Corps of Engineers was then established to run the water pumps. The government bought most of the land (called Public Domain Land) before the Army Corps of Engineers took over. Now, government pays the farmers to live and work on the land so they can grow crops. The land owners can grow crops any time they want, but they have to pay rent or taxes, depending on the laws of the state they live in. For example, some farms have to pay a special fee that the farmers pay, and some farms pay a tax. The government has to pay for the maintenance of the Everglades Agricultural Area. The government controls many properties that are on the land owned by the government, but some properties where citizens own their own homes are not considered \u201cpublic domain land\u201d because they belong to the people who live on the property. So some private property doesn\u2019t belong to the government. Private property that is private is owned by individuals who live on it. The owners of private property use it for production, living, hunting, fishing, and some are renters, who pay rent to the owners of the property. Private property owners have rights, for example, where they live, where they work, and their businesses. Those rights are described and protected under the United States Constitution. Many private property owners enjoy these rights. For example, they can own their house and work on it. They can harvest the crops on their property and have their pets on their property. They can live there, work on it, live on it, visit it, and hunt it. Many people live or operate businesses on private property. Private property owners have the freedom to change their property use to fit their own needs or wants. They can use their property for recreation, tourism, work, and tourism, or for hunting and fishing. It is easy to visit the Everglades Agricultural Area by boat for a tour. Some boats offer a tour of the Everglades, which gives people who live at home the opportunity to experience the Everglades. Boat tours include a boat ride and a pamphlet that is about the tour.

{"prompt":"The Hinomaru was the de facto flag throughout World War II and the occupation period . During the occupation of Japan after World War II , permission from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers","text":"The Hinomaru was the de facto flag throughout World War II and the occupation period. During the occupation of Japan after World War II, permission from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers was taken for it to fly even in Japanese territories. Despite being ordered to fly at half mast, in the spring of 1945 Hinomaru was put up at full mast in an act of defiance. It remained at its highest setting until the defeat of Japan on August 15th of that year.\nThe flag was officially recognized as the national flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China in July 1949, on the request of the communist government. During the war and occupation with Japan it had been used in China as a symbol of the defiance of the Japanese occupation government, similar to the actions of the flag of the Republic of China. During this period the Red Flag of China was the only flag allowed to fly in Chinese mainland.\nOn July 4, 1949, the flag symbolized the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s control over China. It was flown until January 1, 1989. However, the people of Taiwan chose not to follow China in its defiance of Japan. The flag of the Democratic Republic of China (Republic of China on Taiwan) still represents the sovereignty of Taiwan, although it is not flown on mainland China. The flag is flown on the official flags of Taiwan since 1980, but on August 7, 1987, Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office announced that it will return the flag of the PRC (the People's Republic of China) from the flag staff of the Democratic Republic of China after the independence of Taiwan, and the flags will be flown together on August 13, 1988. Since the flag of both sides are the same, a flag that can be flown by both sides is not required (although Taiwan has only flown the flag flown by the Republic of China on Taiwan as the official flag).\nAt the end of November 1987, the flag of the Republic of China on Taiwan used by Taiwan in that day was flown on the flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Since November 30, 1987, the flag of the People\u2019s Republic of China has been exclusively used on the flag of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nIn 1988, Taiwan\u2019s Constitutional Court declared the \u201cflag of the People's Republic of China\u201d to be the flag of the Democratic Republic of China, officially changing the name to the \u201cFlag of the Republic of China on Taiwan\u201d under Act No. 23 of 1988. The Constitutional Court also made the following declaration in the court:\n\u201cThis Constitutional Court considers it as important and just to make an official ruling clarifying the \u2018Flag of the Republic of China on Taiwan\u2019 \u2013 the flag traditionally hoisted on the building of the central government of the people of China, as the national flag of the Republic of China, and the \u2018Rise Star Flag\u2019, the official flag of the Taiwan government. In this way, the people of China and the people of Taiwan can live together as friends and brothers.\u201d\nThis decision was later considered unconstitutional on the day of its promulgation, because the ruling had never been formally announced or presented to legislators before.

As the two were speaking freely, others joined in, so that they eventually formed a small circle in Shanghai. They continued talking after the train had resumed its journey.\nDuring these trips, the two Chinese women had the opportunity to see some of the sites, museums and cultural events which Beijing and Shanghai provide.\nThe author, who wrote the English version as if he wrote in English, told his story in the most native language -Chinese.\nDuring these three trips, the Chinese women had the occasion to see some of Beijing and Shanghai's famous sites, museums and cultural events.\nThe author, who wrote the English version as if he wrote in English, told his story in the most native language -Chinese.\nBook Talk : \" Taikor \" by Liu Chi-Cheng, translated by Tee Yen Fai and Richard Liu.\nAuthor: Liu Chi-Cheng, Chinese\nThis work is one of a series of novels written in the 1980s and early 1990s by the Chinese author Liu Chi-cheng.

Some researchers have suggested they are the same species, but morphological and life @ - @ style data do not support this view. Genetic studies of nuclear markers have not resolved these two species, but studies using the mitochondrial DNA are less concordant.\nThis study addresses the relationship of these two species by examining the genetic structure of the mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial DNA of dusky and Pacific white dolphins collected from both coasts of California and Florida were sequenced. In addition, the complete mitochondrial genome of a dolphin from eastern California, and published sequences of two dolphins from California, one male and one female of each species were included in our analyses. Comparison of these sequences is also useful for understanding the patterns of variation observed. The dusky dolphin, like the blue and humpback whales, is a long-lived species of relatively isolated distributions with a large and continuous breeding population. In contrast, Pacific white dolphins, like the humpback, are short lived and most of the adult female dolphins are in the South Pacific at the time they are collected. The long-lived blue whale is similar to the humpback in this respect, although there are occasional reports of a resident long-lived female in the Gulf of Alaska. The dusky dolphins are generally resident and sometimes return to the same area, and although some Pacific white dolphins are known to do the same, these individuals appear to be generally transients. The distribution of the Pacific white dolphin, however, is relatively discrete and their distribution does not overlap with the large and continuous breeding populations of dusky dolphins.\nThis study demonstrates that the two species of dolphin have distinct, but overlapping mitochondrial haplotypes as well as some unique haplotypes. The two species and the two California taxa share very similar haplotypes with the exception of one haplotype of dusky dolphin. The haplotype with this exception is specific to the long-lived dusky dolphin and cannot be found in the other species or in the two California dusky dolphins. Most of the mitochondrial DNA is composed of polymorphic sites or sites that are diagnostic for individual individuals. The dusky dolphins from all localities and populations have a common set of haplotypes, but some haplotypes are specific to either dusky or Pacific white dolphins. The two Pacific white species, however, have significantly different haplotypes. Together, these differences suggest that the two species have been geographically isolated, and the separation may be relatively old because the most common haplotype in the dusky dolphin is one that is found in the South Pacific. Similarly, the Pacific white dolphins have a high degree of genetic variability, and each population has haplotypes, most of which are unique. The dusky dolphin and the Pacific white dorsal fin shape and structure may also be diagnostic, but these differences have yet to be tested. The two species have a similar mode of reproduction and also appear to respond similarly to environmental perturbation. Although some populations are stable or decreasing, there have been several reported increases in abundance due to management programs and other regulatory and protective measures that have benefited all populations. These data demonstrate that there are two species of dolphin that are found in close proximity to each other both geographically and ecologically, and although their genetic composition may vary somewhat, they are clearly related and it is likely they have a common ancestor.\nWe thank Dr. Charles Gruber for many discussions concerning this work and his suggestions on improving the manuscript.

tissues.","token_len":726,"entropy":[8.0538,4.9121,7.1331,4.0911,1.5422,7.8212,3.8627,14.0157,8.4018,3.9781,13.8329,3.2551,2.6575,5.2929,10.549,0.1741,2.174,5.3688,1.027,6.0834,3.7965,2.0843,1.4811,3.295,1.3871,3.2738,0.6149,0.7376,1.8086,0.9452,10.3026,2.1888,2.5529,5.395,11.3111,0.8597,0.8582,9.7452,6.4336,4.5144,0.0312,1.5715,0.3138,3.3262,0.2836,8.3119,2.6694,1.6777,9.7427,7.0808,3.0819,2.1376,7.3111,2.5712,5.1315,5.4211,2.8301,1.0651,5.7011,2.7426,3.2824,3.8535,1.0764,4.7858,6.4436,10.5136,0.5594,0.0047,0.7661,2.1501,8.2692,3.5028,5.5138,1.0388,4.597,2.6621,3.9934,0.5555,1.0075,3.8124,2.5963,1.1657,2.9051,3.652,0.253,0.9285,3.7441,1.6489,1.0046,1.5478,2.3137,2.116,2.855,4.1488,0.0045,5.8586,0.076,0.0974,0.6035,8.349,0.7345,5.5974,4.5917,0.5905,3.3153,2.4446,3.1225,2.7824,2.91,0.0015,2.4209,3.7972,1.7793,0.504,1.6159,6.2931,0.5061,0.5168,0.7799,4.279,3.7099,1.6958,6.6564,1.6151,2.3085,4.1831,6.7209,6.7288,0.9674,3.7791,3.0529,0.5792,2.9202,1.0881,9.2936,4.0849,0.3109,0.2287,0.019,5.5874,2.175,0.8585,0.8461,4.5556,1.0569,3.8913,2.2065,0.1299,8.5531,0.1635,2.1928,3.0411,4.741,3.8,4.2812,0.8645,2.2095,0.8364,6.7478,0.2744,3.5636,3.7019,4.1595,1.8627,3.5732,0.0001,0.2629,3.3417,4.9749,1.1117,6.6803,2.8165,8.7808,0.0218,2.6723,0.3896,1.2866,1.4598,5.069,0.4966,0.8617,2.2039,3.0221,8.3136,5.652,11.8657,2.9301,1.7356,3.4612,3.7936,5.2945,4.7445,0.7423,0.5873,3.2232,1.2191,0.2598,2.9294,0.0649,0.1237,1.8731,1.9009,0.3188,3.2055,0.1112,5.686,0.7408,4.7294,2.8584,0.9042,5.9639,2.1677,1.4135,4.62,3.9386,1.666,1.1938,3.7455,1.8672,7.4116,0.3268,4.4898,1.7398,1.0568,2.9989,1.364,2.1617,0.2851,1.6531,5.8329,0.4675,0.1922,4.2347,2.0878,1.8013,4.5912,0.6367,0.3762,3.7137,0.0013,2.6091,4.4791,0.4621,0.8482,2.9402,3.7577,0.6375,6.8737,5.3928,0.0873,3.3185,8.4664,4.9456,0.1129,0.5192,2.8972,3.4522,0.8846,3.9068,0.1874,3.216,0.7237,1.4663,3.161,0.0,3.1763,1.4915,5.1052,5.8117,3.139,6.4186,6.2197,0.5802,1.1432,2.9117,2.7449,3.2339,2.7981,5.1363,2.951,5.962,0.1384,0.1335,1.9858,3.643,0.1199,6.0699,3.6964,0.2833,0.9267,3.4722,2.9736,4.917,0.1393,0.8202,6.7249,9.2259,4.0336,0.7776,1.5876,5.5834,0.1467,1.4788,3.2613,0.0526,0.7249,3.0275,2.9013,0.0071,0.7116,4.3311,7.2207,1.1602,5.6477,2.7478,2.9143,0.1083,3.6928,0.7343,1.5076,6.2978,2.8577,0.159,0.865,1.0448,0.7507,2.6953,0.0003,0.5445,1.061,2.0763,2.5393,0.5683,3.8837,0.5144,1.0363,4.1544,1.2115,2.06,1.7404,2.7197,2.3842,3.8533,2.6478,3.6925,4.0825,5.3749,0.2085,5.5849,1.2623,0.0535,4.6379,4.0285,4.7734,0.1076,1.3442,1.4983,3.4317,1.2295,5.5903,1.7599,2.9009,9.9613,7.7324,0.0865,3.5626,4.862,0.2463,3.1557,0.0725,3.6289,1.7941,5.2758,0.1525,2.4977,3.3266,0.0112,2.976,4.0286,0.0006,0.556,1.4748,1.2893,3.2329,0.4766,5.3235,3.3326,6.7959,0.5802,5.802,0.281,0.6453,6.435,0.1684,0.2038,3.9899,0.0001,0.166,1.6607,6.7003,0.1348,3.8486,0.307,0.9804,3.1572,2.3053,4.4969,1.8351,0.6961,3.5241,1.5218,6.1011,0.0039,0.5505,0.3116,6.241,1.2463,0.1327,2.8029,0.6871,3.8492,5.1207,0.0653,5.8419,0.3727,4.7323,5.3076,3.7755,1.6867,0.9888,9.496,1.2366,5.4473,4.6158,0.9139,1.4882,3.7757,0.0,2.0314,5.7458,5.2432,7.9399,0.1029,2.9748,3.9031,2.0503,2.1253,3.1407,3.7621,0.0027,2.1148,0.0675,1.8055,1.7804,3.3651,2.9748,0.067,0.912,3.3247,0.1847,6.0348,4.3879,0.0,0.6187,0.2564,0.0329,0.1139,0.3395,1.5267,3.2683,3.6157,0.0442,7.8195,2.1266,1.7551,0.0011,1.5998,5.9391,0.6339,0.8542,0.0784,1.1947,6.5184,0.554,0.6382,2.8779,1.9375,0.215,0.6311,0.7848,0.8285,1.6745,5.815,4.2334,1.3034,2.4629,1.3044,3.2794,8.2279,3.2631,1.1582,6.426,6.5746,5.5451,1.7558,6.0122,1.603,1.0145,0.759,2.0993,0.7636,2.6309,0.0,0.3079,0.8886,4.9271,1.1822,0.744,3.7582,0.4955,0.9676,4.5517,0.0501,0.6521,7.1734,0.0198,0.5381,2.4553,0.0292,1.6577,1.9174,1.3274,5.2999,1.9762,0.0016,2.3127,2.7374,1.6389,1.67,5.2725,4.0265,0.9379,5.0401,0.1598,4.8798,6.1336,1.4416,0.087,0.3653,2.5643,1.8079,1.8226,3.7018,0.0,0.5123,1.9989,0.6005,0.2983,0.0101,10.4247,0.1191,10.0995,3.6461,6.5169,3.953,3.2171,0.7413,6.3974,3.8726,1.1973,2.9709,2.3019,3.6248,4.8889,0.0164,0.0323,4.1832,0.5791,2.0813,3.2922,1.9568,1.8629,2.2538,3.1399,8.5288,0.0483,3.1668,1.7018,5.1445,5.7733,0.0747,6.9253,4.2797,0.1207,2.2414,5.3615,0.0005,3.5998,0.6481,4.6131,3.5167,4.1684,2.5999,5.94,3.4131,6.7031,1.1921,2.9792,3.7155,0.1141,3.319,4.0093,5.2724,0.1614,6.3844,3.7878,0.0068,7.3714,5.1059,1.9767,2.4485,6.9415,4.1444,7.4703,1.6709,3.5859,0.9737,5.7485,4.8895,2.0617,0.3962,3.03,3.5826,3.6896,0.3332,3.5155,1.0815,3.3657,2.3326,0.79,0.8402,1.3552,1.5313,6.1156,0.7228,4.1746,0.3193,0.5989,0.3852,0.0061,6.7743,2.8585,0.1895,3.9183,0.0009,1.8753,0.6118,6.4289,3.1665,1.9407,3.6835,1.3927,1.9969,3.9242,0.7568,1.4525,1.2621,4.4048,1.7922,2.5508,6.7845,0.4049,1.4796,3.0612,2.5326,2.7867,0.3396,2.4903,0.412,1.0196,4.2633,2.0389,2.2632,0.3898,5.2143,8.3277,0.9302,1.6841,6.7543,4.7669,4.5445,2.1263,2.1067,1.276,3.9458,6.2854,2.1786,7.699,0.7431,4.3904,0.3706,1.1623,1.1161,0.2177,0.8088,0.1099,5.5303,9.5745,6.2075,8.2621,2.4098,0.6474,0.8619,0.0056,0.8594,5.5578,0.0063,0.6741,2.6983,2.1626,5.1

The first type is brownish skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. The second type is the hyaline hyphae. These are arranged in a network of narrow ( 0-5 mm ) hyphae, and the hyphae of the subhymenium tend to be broader than those of the hymenium.\nAmylostereaceae seem to be related chemically to Boletaceae, Russulaceae and Amanitaceae, and they have characteristics in common with the Agaricaceae. Among them, they are characterised by the presence of two types of hyphae, skeletal hyphae and interhymenial hyphae, these can be seen in the Fig. 14.\nAmylostereaceae are characterised by the presence of hyaline hyphae, with a narrower and denser structure than in Hymenochaetaceae. These hyphae are associated with an epidermis or subepidermis consisting mainly of skeletal hyphae, but in these latter types of mycelia a thin hyphal fringe ( 0-5 mm wide ) of hyphae that resemble mycelium and present a reticulate texture are visible in their superficial extension.\nMany of the species currently placed in the family Amylostereaceae differ from each other mainly in their anatomy, but in some cases there are species differences in their external appearance.\nThere is no doubt that the family Amylostereaceae was erected by Deflandre, who provided most of the generic characters. In 1931, Vogl, who included it within the Boletaceae, made use of numerous morphological characters :\n1. The presence of a brownish skeletal matrix, a central white hypha with an eosinophilic content and a peripheral zone that consists of an apathogenic hyaline stroma. These elements are characteristic of the genera Boletus and Lycoperdon.\n2. The presence of brownish hyphae with a hyaline subhymenium and a very narrow hymenium, although no white structures are present. There are no known amyloid structures, and the subhymenium does not form a subpellis.\n3. The hyaline hyphal network, which in some species is surrounded by a dense epidermis. In a few species the hymenium is thicker, and a subpellis forms a complex structure around the hyphae with several thinly defined cell walls.\nThere have been no advances in the classification of the Amylostereaceae, probably because no new taxa have been discovered in recent years. Some changes have been suggested in some genera, such as a subgenus of Myriotominae Deflandre ( Amylostereum Vogl ), in order to solve the difficulties in assigning the species.\nOn the morphological side, the family cannot be placed firmly in any higher classification. In my approach, I consider its phylogenetic position to be at the base of Hymenochaetaceae, forming a small, intermediate group with Ascomorphaceae. An alternative hypothesis is that Amylostereaceae are sister to all other families, which was suggested by Deflandre ( 1886 ), and followed by Vogl ( 1931 ).\nThe relationship between this family and others can be resolved only when studies of mycotoxin and secondary metabolites in more species are completed.","token_len":727,"entropy":[8.7843,6.1671,9.3198,7.113,9.1739,8.7519,1.2743,7.1154,14.1362,6.8233,6.899,2.6998,4.965,1.262,4.0706,1.2541,6.1928,4.7371,9.7457,0.4971,3.105,3.4302,4.8124,0.0771,6.7178,1.3118,0.0388,1.715,1.1443,2.2169,2.5609,1.0169,7.9423,1.8102,12.5635,4.577,0.0599,0.0032,1.2207,1.2645,6.7399,7.2368,2.0423,0.6216,6.2121,6.465,1.0578,0.4313,0.3568,0.2148,0.3672,4.2533,5.6651,6.714,1.9058,0.4721,0.0159,2.4439,2.2187,1.9159,6.0814,0.4884,0.9213,8.1605,1.1572,6.0733,5.9082,9.7833,3.1937,2.9037,1.1938,1.5398,4.7759,0.8139,0.0146,1.5071,3.0987,2.2812,2.4036,3.1358,0.1209,3.3782,0.4885,6.123,3.6085,1.4743,5.2569,4.6991,0.1656,1.0554,6.4399,1.2191,1.1099,0.1023,0.0875,2.0642,3.8512,0.5904,0.8254,2.7797,14.8586,9.703,8.1778,2.1284,8.9413,0.1238,0.9557,4.4732,8.221,0.3931,11.5042,4.1962,2.5439,0.9686,13.4698,3.1321,0.2162,1.2677,5.7775,4.0751,0.0298,0.9198,2.0945,2.7285,2.2116,7.7327,4.6633,2.3744,0.3897,1.576,5.7368,1.0279,0.8171,0.5037,1.0826,5.8773,2.6708,1.0501,1.7334,1.1413,8.1493,0.7699,0.08,2.4758,3.644,0.0494,2.9705,3.2288,0.0891,1.1363,0.5367,0.0149,1.2185,10.0899,0.9078,0.0946,0.0021,0.4348,7.3533,3.9955,0.7188,1.2205,0.2888,0.0814,0.0005,1.2483,7.8902,5.6426,0.5857,2.9267,0.8996,1.0475,7.7125,0.125,4.6063,1.0168,1.4703,6.9872,0.1897,0.0423,1.0252,1.0972,6.5336,0.0011,0.0898,1.1579,1.1872,0.0163,4.559,3.9234,0.1911,0.0139,0.001,1.2491,3.5608,2.2168,6.6669,4.1289,5.625,0.0354,3.4432,2.2249,3.7973,8.221,1.7776,6.3977,5.9545,5.0258,1.5132,0.8269,2.2112,0.792,0.7868,0.0049,0.7377,5.4863,0.0879,3.6587,6.7535,0.846,0.3135,4.3325,5.4497,1.9609,0.0023,0.1745,5.9243,3.21,0.002,6.5447,0.3546,0.0826,0.002,1.2104,2.4813,3.7876,5.1004,4.1529,2.9679,1.604,4.0366,0.0263,0.1108,3.439,4.3122,2.849,3.1321,7.9322,3.5199,3.9454,0.543,1.0703,0.0601,4.7779,0.5611,3.9953,2.3579,1.1436,0.0232,5.7513,5.0391,5.3725,0.3654,1.5165,3.6953,6.3946,1.4364,8.6844,0.7225,0.6798,4.7917,3.3966,3.5939,2.8013,4.8204,7.3222,8.6014,0.4934,1.5278,6.4501,1.5084,0.279,3.1183,8.6659,8.1726,0.7286,0.6268,3.0441,2.9064,0.0583,0.0785,0.1435,0.0918,7.6685,0.3412,3.3498,0.0404,5.1092,0.211,0.9909,6.0157,1.2052,2.3235,2.8167,2.0075,1.0117,3.2438,0.7776,4.3734,9.1645,1.5833,1.2339,7.3658,2.1093,0.708,2.2941,4.2808,1.7781,2.312,4.8034,0.1225,1.2804,5.3909,0.7487,0.0063,0.0085,0.0132,0.1237,3.7543,9.063,1.8269,12.7103,9.7354,4.1419,2.0896,1.7493,6.7374,5.4444,0.1611,0.176,9.9185,6.5159,2.199,2.8268,7.7206,0.8538,7.7374,6.7678,2.5184,1.6756,6.6574,4.9366,5.2435,0.5072,9.4995,0.0163,0.2388,1.3656,3.7633,4.3733,0.0058,6.9549,4.6035,0.1647,3.9411,10.1271,2.5755,4.3554,0.4579,2.3325,6.7032,0.0342,1.6596,6.8116,1.1267,2.6224,9.0238,1.8691,3.2356,6.0526,5.5624,2.4063,4.161,3.4625,3.0139,5.0038,3.3789,0.7533,0.3386,1.799,6.9198,2.9513,0.7349,8.7874,7.8067,3.2276,4.4552,0.5149,3.1589,3.8937,7.6684,4.8685,1.5861,4.0626,7.3132,1.6977,1.445,4.7061,4.9725,1.0232,3.074,0.1454,0.7816,4.6154,0.0209,2.3128,0.008,4.2026,1.4185,9.1697,1.9883,4.8348,9.2529,2.1727,1.0938,0.155,0.0013,0.4075,1.484,0.0124,5.494,0.4511,1.2968,0.4342,0.0039,2.0045,1.1646,4.2522,0.4378,5.7904,2.1535,1.2874,1.3705,2.1227,0.9568,6.1006,3.1366,1.4267,6.1528,1.0553,1.8499,4.9138,5.1892,7.5806,6.161,0.8515,1.0207,0.7206,4.6904,0.8632,2.2629,3.8033,7.2371,0.0188,1.3615,3.7302,2.2438,2.047,1.5715,4.3129,0.0821,0.0946,0.3304,3.8879,0.1023,2.5258,1.0809,4.3578,11.2331,7.0106,1.7236,0.4842,0.1194,0.0013,0.3269,3.237,0.5749,0.7352,2.4815,7.7327,2.6545,1.753,5.1664,2.4112,1.8466,0.9416,5.7555,0.052,0.9968,4.1151,4.7696,0.01,0.1359,1.4371,3.2819,4.5588,1.7172,1.106,1.9229,1.0678,4.8262,0.3206,0.8737,5.2611,1.515,1.2996,4.1774,4.3499,3.0455,0.0259,3.0904,5.0375,5.5274,3.5996,5.3676,0.4351,0.7506,2.9463,0.0155,5.2032,5.2413,10.7719,3.7556,7.5743,1.5512,0.4722,0.7044,5.4433,3.6794,0.2501,2.6347,7.7341,0.1421,1.1049,2.9107,0.1409,1.5336,1.387,0.0035,0.0093,0.0094,0.146,1.6232,6.3036,0.7043,4.6626,3.5895,3.2975,1.107,0.9443,0.2156,1.6051,2.146,2.6809,0.5247,0.2528,4.5534,6.3879,0.9735,0.3256,4.5443,1.8207,2.9499,3.6478,0.004,0.8868,1.5471,0.003,3.7142,4.3174,5.865,0.0922,0.9113,5.5751,9.4583,5.9801,5.6613,0.3761,13.458,0.1733,0.0159,2.3554,8.7066,0.0618,0.018,0.0467,3.722,7.7962,0.9351,2.5603,4.4304,5.1385,0.0221,6.4061,0.4445,5.4553,1.6612,6.3969,1.6923,2.3547,2.6919,0.9657,5.497,0.3327,8.6116,0.087,1.7729,0.3268,1.2054,2.9003,9.6411,0.1485,5.1548,7.2223,1.2421,4.0535,7.5427,2.7624,1.4575,2.7027,5.3848,8.1846,1.8384,2.4806,4.4534,5.5657,5.2064,0.5151,1.0993,1.5167,0.1316,4.8283,1.9162,3.0173,0.0811,8.7673,0.7229,0.2781,0.0863,0.064,0.4565,1.1171,7.3683,1.0842,5.1142,3.3867,4.8121,1.7585,1.7112,6.7973,4.3107,5.3797,0.96,1.3129,6.177,3.3324,4.3526,0.6326,0.3068,3.5965,0.0082,0.0023,0.007,0.4558,1.5948,7.8334,1.5493,5.6524,1.3334,3.756,1.3344,2.6745,5.4053,2.0206,0.606,5.292,0.0407,0.0037,2.0079,8.6149,2.343,1.718,8.826,0.5471,4.8706,0.0758,0.5431,4.0202,0.4809,0.9864,1.6477,5.5538,0.4021,5.1358,1.1366,0.205,5.2135,4.5624,0.1536,5.4908,3.5797,4.1781,7.0921,1.2364,3.8434,5.1148,2.0407,2.6657,8.0

Often the Bates method is taught by those with little or no formal educational background in opthalmology. There are some who would deny even the existence of a sight threatening condition which can require prompt medical attention and would be content with waiting until the last minute or until the day before they are scheduled in for cataract surgery on the hope that there will be no need to take any immediate action. This could be potentially dangerous in that no doctor knows the progression of a certain disease, or in some cases if one is to be a more definitive or drastic measure such as surgery. In a recent case study by Packer et al,3 four patients were diagnosed with cataracts, and it was reported that while they had not undergone cataract Surgery, which would normally have occurred after a number of years, two patients received an operation for cystoid macular edema the day before their scheduled day for cataract surgery. In my experience as a cataract surgeon, I see patients come in with cataracts that do not progress, yet require surgery within weeks or days of their scheduled day for cataract surgery. The possibility of complications can be magnified if a person does not take every precaution possible to ensure that the cataract would not progress or get worse in this time.\nMany times I have personally witnessed a patient come in with a cataract that was in a stage that was too advanced to be expected to become worse if proper treatment were not provided. I do not doubt that all of these cases had been explained to the patient prior to the surgery, but the point that I wish to emphasize is that an individual needs to have a thoughtful discussion with his or her doctor prior to going with any treatment that would require them to seek medical advice. A number of times I have witnessed a patient go into surgery having had a discussion with their doctor and not only had the cataract removed, but in many cases the medical advice that preceded the surgery were provided in the form of a medical evaluation and notes.\nConclusion\nIf a person is not seeking treatment for the cataract as a result of his or her faith in the Bates method, I would not recommend that an immediate course of action be started until they have spoken with an ophthalmologist regarding the cataract and determined the need for immediate action. I would also have my patients receive a written evaluation letter or summary of the information obtained from a reputable ophthalmologist and have the completed evaluation sent to the patient's doctor, who was the one who had recommended the Bates method to my patients. When this is done, the risk that the eyesight will deteriorate in some way due to being untreated for a sight threatening condition would be diminished and that person could be assured that any risk would be greatly minimized.\nIf one believes that the Bates method is reliable in terms of preventing serious complications and improving one's vision, there are a number of reasons why more people should seek the advice of an ophthalmologist regarding the possibility of receiving the Bates method. One reason is that the Bates approach can be highly dangerous for an individual who is seeking to avoid any eye surgery or the use of other treatment methods for a sight threatening condition. While I have never seen a serious eye problem in any of my patients since the Bates method was started, each person should know that these complications can result in loss of sight.","token_len":728,"entropy":[2.8006,0.4101,4.4401,7.7461,5.0302,1.3333,9.661,2.0007,1.3298,15.2443,6.4467,0.5049,0.8485,5.3559,3.9822,2.1091,2.0453,5.834,1.6566,0.1931,0.0001,0.0521,4.5064,5.7639,2.6301,4.7212,3.9689,4.8269,0.9143,2.5346,13.7971,15.5975,8.8076,3.8037,12.0966,9.4709,8.0171,2.259,1.1086,0.5589,0.7339,7.3121,2.5228,6.9953,0.7297,1.1431,6.0881,1.9656,3.6594,2.5054,4.9005,0.9504,0.0266,5.6762,6.0581,1.5837,1.7498,11.6175,4.1257,0.4262,1.2401,4.3433,0.9866,2.8417,2.7004,3.2157,5.2579,5.6486,1.266,2.793,0.0075,1.495,5.8004,8.2029,0.2578,4.5278,2.9855,4.8698,6.1271,0.2568,0.6653,2.6285,4.3936,2.7667,8.8348,2.0542,4.8456,1.2279,1.2835,5.1521,0.4979,4.2867,2.9444,1.2043,5.043,2.2839,2.7364,2.2779,5.8377,5.1074,3.2027,9.2233,0.4484,0.234,0.0713,4.8484,1.5066,8.0553,0.4367,3.7992,0.9535,0.1435,0.8168,3.1511,0.897,3.86,1.6249,5.4377,1.5393,0.9255,2.7379,4.5261,1.2118,8.0129,1.9984,3.4949,2.8427,5.4403,4.3097,4.3064,2.126,10.1773,0.2833,1.3874,5.0316,1.1225,2.1552,2.1677,5.2288,4.0517,0.3355,5.1893,3.5592,1.5462,3.912,1.7731,4.0023,7.1667,6.285,5.2955,8.1522,4.2776,5.8324,0.026,2.1411,0.9794,3.1995,3.2639,3.5853,2.7089,5.2706,3.214,10.9229,1.4868,1.2862,0.0108,2.5038,9.3983,8.1329,1.8069,1.528,2.6696,0.109,2.6889,0.0022,1.5906,2.5103,1.5968,4.7765,0.5458,2.9663,0.1605,5.2622,2.22,1.8123,3.4035,3.1069,2.1495,0.0086,0.0582,7.1373,0.964,6.6989,3.2519,2.4975,3.1677,4.9523,2.9428,2.2318,5.8787,0.0043,1.1668,1.1255,4.5028,1.904,4.5495,3.6103,4.222,3.7067,7.3434,1.0784,7.8173,6.224,0.4339,5.5616,0.0232,6.2586,1.2242,1.166,2.3011,3.9392,5.7595,3.8153,1.0328,0.0018,0.0267,0.2926,0.3747,2.9887,5.578,1.6795,4.1538,0.4779,4.3141,0.3357,0.0534,0.1418,0.7247,2.1882,4.2645,2.1296,5.5222,0.9431,2.0256,3.4437,0.0075,0.7479,2.9388,3.2113,0.0632,4.9447,3.135,4.6004,6.2723,3.7065,3.6811,3.4772,1.5952,3.385,1.8932,2.1089,0.2856,1.6782,1.6071,0.924,0.0006,0.0078,0.1993,0.2622,2.5575,5.1576,0.7876,4.0732,4.0666,0.7981,5.5988,0.0293,1.5059,2.0429,3.337,3.0147,0.1264,3.5656,6.3475,1.6517,2.7102,0.632,2.4506,0.8495,1.5479,2.0762,0.0328,0.1131,5.1124,0.3834,2.2082,2.9191,5.8113,0.7355,3.1176,4.8189,4.1323,0.9546,2.3282,8.9997,4.5516,2.5509,1.1565,5.464,3.0105,2.1832,0.8368,2.3925,0.6036,0.6699,1.2351,0.9638,0.0057,0.0174,2.4898,2.1084,4.5112,3.5822,4.8332,2.5942,1.644,4.4441,2.7471,1.215,1.2392,3.9884,3.1456,5.6168,5.5923,4.4414,7.2503,2.5177,1.444,0.6431,3.1503,0.3425,2.231,3.4786,0.199,4.2555,0.3373,5.8696,1.9826,1.6782,2.7077,5.8492,2.2552,6.2925,0.9985,1.6165,0.4633,3.407,0.0273,1.2184,0.9012,1.2139,0.743,2.6507,5.4229,3.4578,0.914,4.2867,0.1463,3.2597,0.5093,0.1699,5.0163,1.8796,4.1747,0.2472,2.7404,1.5847,6.8492,1.8067,0.8802,2.2785,0.7262,0.002,1.4345,3.5484,0.003,4.2253,5.0445,2.7718,2.8993,2.4601,3.2533,3.8851,2.7827,0.0644,3.8756,0.7606,1.8125,1.0591,3.5885,5.2172,0.008,2.2937,1.2909,0.2398,2.6149,2.3138,0.2365,4.1774,2.3348,2.1718,5.465,3.6749,1.5557,7.9345,0.2097,2.3521,0.3725,2.902,3.3984,4.9286,1.9852,1.6038,4.0036,0.0071,0.059,2.4178,0.7688,0.2009,4.7907,2.5838,0.3035,1.7212,5.9457,4.1635,2.7517,8.1479,0.8735,0.2743,5.7517,5.2453,2.5343,1.9297,1.1189,0.0296,1.3708,3.6889,4.7825,2.3523,7.8348,1.3871,2.7731,5.8654,0.4556,3.9496,2.1923,1.1487,1.48,2.7116,5.953,4.2298,1.2956,2.781,2.5106,0.0015,0.1667,4.8408,2.1035,2.2666,0.0025,3.3045,0.0598,0.0025,6.5593,1.0607,0.3773,0.2203,0.1037,0.5031,3.682,1.378,3.3003,0.9055,1.2963,4.3027,6.6699,5.6197,0.0448,1.9514,0.3382,7.5653,3.2034,2.9536,1.0304,7.3903,0.5117,3.2006,6.2027,0.0172,0.0464,0.0093,4.0101,0.9695,3.917,0.001,0.0351,2.1305,7.5987,2.4723,3.8843,0.184,2.0736,4.7592,0.3024,2.3676,1.0533,2.7265,5.2746,4.3916,0.9362,5.4537,1.7325,3.9163,3.783,8.7392,3.7139,7.3446,0.4508,1.1981,3.1581,5.2923,0.8962,2.358,4.4061,2.2973,0.0002,0.0462,0.012,2.4988,3.7994,2.0784,8.458,3.4621,4.4291,0.237,0.9957,1.1098,2.5425,1.4036,3.5117,2.0101,6.4884,3.497,1.6518,0.7995,3.4124,4.5514,0.9539,6.5312,0.1236,1.8101,3.1354,0.9136,0.6236,4.95,3.3606,1.3905,0.5404,0.3537,1.3148,5.9911,2.4544,1.3126,8.2962,2.3435,1.8237,1.1969,0.0006,3.3434,2.5614,0.4808,3.5598,0.0056,5.2779,7.1476,3.9036,1.6251,9.4829,1.4255,0.0341,3.774,0.4439,4.6952,1.6493,3.9721,5.9329,2.4802,1.0478,5.9913,0.8771,4.2139,6.4768,2.8855,0.2833,4.7357,1.9402,0.5321,1.0132,3.1615,4.2842,2.8617,0.2415,1.525,2.1561,0.0975,0.7746,7.8986,3.1105,3.4168,0.0007,3.3969,5.5828,2.7446,2.1864,4.3436,5.7679,0.0177,1.9118,0.6016,3.5804,1.1049,2.2808,0.1898,0.0032,2.4271,0.7593,6.8711,2.173,0.5862,1.5511,2.0918,4.6131,0.237,0.5582,0.2124,0.0001,0.0104,0.0034,3.898,0.9106,5.2155,0.1013,4.5088,2.6997,0.3511,0.0774,0.5231,1.9923,2.1869,0.8774,0.4027,1.6174,2.5117,4.6371,2.5377,0.7432,4.5245,6.3054,1.948,4.1555,0.2122,1.8187,1.1831,3.2937,1.85,2.5798,3.438,5.4103,2.9808,2.5097,4.1123,3.4949,0.0133,3.9603,4.6282,1.3241,3.3001,1.9973,1.347,0.1681,0.0226,0.4777,4.1926,1.8794,2.3342,2.6601,1.1076,1.0305,5.0403,2.3981,1.9511,2.1382,3.1382,0.9694,0.1737,0.1737,6.1536,2.0321,3.0216,0.4076,0.3875,5.4442,0.4576,7.6317,4.2659,3.7629,3.2874,0.5174,4.784

{"prompt":"During the 1941 collapse of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War , the Independent State of Croatia was created . It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Usta\u0161a regime","text":"During the 1941 collapse of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Usta\u0161a regime, which had become a major wartime ally of the Axis powers. The USSR also became a neutral power during the war. When the war ended in November 1945, the Independent State of Croatia was created as part of the newly established Democratic State of Croatia, and still held the Croat ethnic-majority regions. The Croats had been ethnically isolated since they had been expelled from Slavonia, Vojvodina and Montenegro.\nThe Independent State of Croatia was established on a military state basis. The regime initially supported the Yugoslav Communist Party through secret meetings between its highest leaders. The independent state government was founded in November 1941. The first PrimeMinister was Ante Markovi\u0107. In 1944, the president was Josip Broz Tito, who would later become the last Communist dictator in the Slavonic-Central European countries and a world leader in the new post-cold war socialist system.\nAfter the proclamation of the state on 2 November 1941 in Zagreb, the government of the new state established an army of the Croatian SS and a paramilitary organisation, the Popular Front of Ante \u010coli\u0107. One year later, two days before the outbreak of World War II, Croatia declared independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\nAt the same time, Slovenia (after Slovenia declared independence as a republic of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the winter of 1941, the Slovenian SS were founded as part of the Croatian SS, on 4 April 1942. The Slovenian SS were armed. The Slovenian SS consisted of approximately 20,000 men. The Slovenian SS were also subordinated to the Independent State of Croatia. During the war, the Slovene SS were a major source of terror in the Lika region, particularly within the so-called Vojvodina, the Serbian language region in Dalmatia.\nAfter the war, Slovenia declared that it would seek to incorporate Croatia into it. In February 1947, when Slovenia voted to establish the Socialist Republic of Slovenia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was followed by an unsuccessful intervention of the Independent Republic of Croatia in February 1948. The attempt failed as Slovenians took over both the northern and southern parts of Croatia. The Croat minority in the eastern regions of Croatia was also expelled from the country, to a great extent in exchange for the Slovenian SS territories to the north. In the last years of the Republic of Croatia, Slovenia claimed to make a strong appeal to the international community to recognize the Croatian state, including the proclamation of the Croatian identity as the country's official language, which never happened.\nDuring World War II, Croatia had its own army: the Croatian SS, that was under the leadership of Ante \u010coli\u0107. The war began with a successful military offensive of the Independent State of Croatia by the Usta\u0161a troops in late December 1941. As a response to this movement, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ordered the Yugoslav army to engage in a counterattack to defeat Croatia. However, after a few weeks of unsuccessful military operations, the Usta\u0161a troops advanced to Lika where they were joined and supported by the Yugoslav SS troops. During the course of the war, as a result of these military actions and the resistance of the civilian population in the Slavonic-Central European countries (particularly in the territory between the German front lines and Slovenian and Croatian front lines), Yugoslavia was able to retain control over most of its former territories.","token_len":729,"entropy":[1.9437,9.3273,8.1779,0.1641,0.4932,9.431,0.4944,2.2734,5.5352,1.302,4.8376,5.0307,4.0046,2.3757,8.3196,4.9881,0.3335,1.5677,8.5809,4.1576,1.4042,1.857,1.5263,3.8324,1.6287,2.1749,0.822,5.0918,0.1006,1.4006,8.882,2.345,5.872,2.2332,0.5838,1.625,5.9644,1.3896,0.9756,1.9934,3.9383,1.9064,2.8305,8.2485,2.1467,0.5399,0.5643,3.6336,3.1601,0.5208,1.6058,6.0736,4.044,2.8841,0.9304,6.5153,2.8942,3.4233,0.3109,1.1553,1.0593,5.4891,0.8106,2.9614,0.4808,0.8555,3.976,2.5223,0.2409,1.1113,3.2049,0.0732,0.4432,0.116,0.9097,4.11,2.0733,2.4459,0.0007,0.5034,4.4255,1.7243,5.2381,4.7065,0.2572,0.4694,1.7134,3.3212,7.0779,4.0068,1.6695,8.9381,7.229,3.9923,5.0328,4.1142,2.4566,1.8887,8.2892,0.0422,2.8714,1.6611,4.3646,0.0017,5.5205,1.4359,4.0459,2.1111,1.2996,2.4147,0.2765,7.8076,2.118,3.4153,8.6043,0.5516,0.2619,0.0168,0.0427,1.122,3.1833,0.0043,2.4228,1.8893,6.3931,1.6731,0.0504,0.1106,0.0728,0.9977,2.4524,2.3981,3.897,5.0562,8.4762,0.8503,1.4968,1.3994,6.2507,6.4826,3.2767,0.6884,3.9057,3.7955,0.147,5.3067,7.5676,3.0749,3.4749,2.3152,6.2416,1.691,1.9942,1.669,5.2097,1.0815,5.2814,1.3875,4.3239,1.4127,3.7508,2.0644,1.8583,1.3555,3.6132,6.7846,10.4397,0.3691,2.0729,7.1694,1.6888,9.7472,2.1952,0.0279,1.8929,2.7936,4.0341,0.5146,0.9857,5.7061,1.7237,5.7235,0.0181,0.918,0.2306,0.029,0.0006,1.059,0.9838,4.6228,0.8912,0.4302,1.5367,5.7796,5.5104,4.3922,1.1146,1.302,6.7708,1.7216,4.0003,7.3816,0.6203,3.1781,3.9129,2.498,5.398,0.8498,0.6068,1.4731,6.8929,5.8398,0.1287,6.4203,0.1312,4.8858,5.2432,0.3152,1.4454,3.5229,0.5886,9.3866,0.066,0.5531,5.0737,3.7965,5.3202,2.682,1.4458,4.2713,4.5516,0.0849,0.0017,0.2232,1.0445,3.4496,1.8247,1.1968,2.9012,2.4406,4.1832,2.7873,3.8676,1.4783,4.6581,2.8676,6.421,2.5241,3.3172,3.7863,4.7281,1.7127,0.5604,7.5898,1.4772,1.3261,6.9013,0.1465,10.8218,0.5083,8.8674,0.2536,0.848,6.0954,3.0762,0.2925,0.3041,5.4021,3.9707,1.4599,0.3062,4.0325,0.0014,2.2037,0.0019,0.1224,0.1291,3.0752,3.1999,1.2933,0.555,1.4297,7.4095,0.0344,0.1517,0.7667,1.4388,4.678,0.4279,2.2609,0.0201,0.2423,5.5842,4.7218,5.0378,3.7425,6.712,0.3379,4.7331,0.8772,2.6439,3.1533,1.336,4.1383,0.1229,0.7174,1.3518,3.8674,6.8253,0.0263,1.3706,3.2713,2.7673,4.6584,0.3714,4.6039,5.089,4.4487,2.4586,2.1201,0.0005,0.2128,2.5708,1.429,2.7572,5.993,3.3238,3.1887,1.2693,2.9983,1.171,2.1532,0.1026,0.3121,1.8332,5.677,6.1886,1.3076,2.1556,0.0524,0.753,5.0903,0.1599,4.0667,3.2504,0.5585,0.0228,1.2649,1.5778,1.2255,1.6956,0.0324,0.2933,2.3767,3.089,9.0743,0.0101,0.1002,0.2774,7.7976,0.1226,0.1494,0.0665,1.3781,3.7929,0.3817,1.2461,0.3834,0.7993,1.4034,7.8465,0.2759,2.245,4.1545,1.3455,3.9956,0.0402,5.3929,1.6764,1.3197,7.164,8.8993,5.3931,1.4844,3.7177,5.0642,0.6305,7.0139,0.2703,0.0006,5.8051,0.7186,0.1691,0.0107,0.1372,3.7881,3.0992,4.0362,5.6791,2.3325,3.3082,8.0467,0.0302,0.0583,1.1216,1.3861,2.8641,0.449,2.0756,0.3147,2.6554,3.274,3.6182,0.7007,0.5703,5.3274,1.2163,5.4432,2.1518,0.3622,5.0137,1.36,2.059,2.8615,4.2235,0.1386,4.8209,1.8081,5.2393,0.6211,3.6385,1.1863,6.3425,0.4643,0.0701,1.8148,2.4054,1.3009,5.2465,6.6945,0.2075,0.1567,1.5737,0.4203,2.1436,2.002,6.2846,0.115,3.4572,6.6219,7.1822,2.9005,0.5363,5.0215,4.6098,0.0667,0.3992,1.5202,3.1928,0.4033,0.3781,1.6177,6.0903,1.8016,3.3988,3.0414,2.6058,4.2484,1.2648,6.3343,1.1283,5.7826,0.5377,0.3853,1.0669,0.0222,2.1862,0.7451,1.8031,5.321,4.0155,1.4273,1.2467,3.8979,2.9191,0.7201,0.7129,1.926,3.2765,3.524,0.5603,0.968,2.1845,2.3814,5.4405,3.2499,4.2775,0.1651,3.5375,5.2026,0.0065,1.4017,4.8075,0.2261,0.7406,9.006,5.6802,2.684,1.6744,1.2564,2.3417,2.0873,5.1798,2.306,0.1121,0.2445,5.2814,0.6769,0.3487,0.474,3.3288,5.28,2.1189,7.399,1.6975,3.7117,5.5064,0.598,0.4786,3.9021,0.0701,1.4916,4.941,0.9923,3.0398,2.5115,2.2365,4.7635,1.3888,7.076,0.0788,0.9986,3.9543,6.7131,1.5444,2.0888,3.8111,1.8563,1.7353,1.183,2.0954,2.4361,6.9759,2.0359,0.2211,0.7091,3.1863,2.8388,0.0018,0.0206,0.143,2.3746,3.4549,3.4269,1.1451,3.705,5.5315,0.8899,1.2066,2.0011,1.8168,6.2249,1.5447,4.5376,0.5005,3.0862,0.0099,3.4893,0.0646,3.4345,0.007,0.062,0.0016,0.8917,1.1335,6.8782,3.8879,1.595,1.7599,3.847,3.7565,1.948,3.1118,1.4384,8.2021,0.1198,0.0236,0.035,3.6773,0.6951,4.3933,0.956,0.0052,0.0236,3.5785,1.832,4.6886,2.9641,0.9085,0.5552,4.5358,1.932,4.9507,0.4827,2.437,8.4132,0.4698,0.684,7.0506,0.0451,0.4182,5.1464,0.8944,5.8267,2.9118,0.2733,6.1533,0.6172,1.6259,2.7399,1.7131,3.0512,6.1006,4.6927,1.1181,3.7999,0.0178,3.5233,2.2056,2.7435,2.0301,0.7468,5.4007,3.2128,1.0726,0.4696,0.6549,2.8935,0.0054,0.001,0.0073,1.3407,5.2565,1.8272,5.6472,3.9113,5.2888,0.3677,1.5136,3.5534,6.0264,4.5003,0.047,0.5388,3.1765,3.5984,3.6717,0.3947,3.1169,0.4471,3.4239,0.0006,0.4893,1.1498,0.1489,5.5455,2.9869,0.2827,0.0533,2.9519,3.4902,2.5123,4.0362,0.9083,5.8881,0.479,0.3325,7.2734,0.0928,2.7229,0.8515,6.6247,0.6432,0.929,0.292,0.0587,0.2002,4.5442,4.2919,1.2999,1.1534,6.8795,4.465,1.4543,6.2408,5.5719,3.0083,0.2369,5.5973,0.1283,3.8611,1.1147,1.2551,0.0494,0.3403,3.664,1.8058,3.0197,0.0076,4.4747,1.

{"prompt":"On December 19 , 2014 , the Rays traded Hanigan and Wil Myers to the San Diego Padres as part of a three @ - @ team transaction , in which the Padres traded Jake","text":"On December 19, 2014, the Rays traded Hanigan and Wil Myers to the San Diego Padres as part of a three @ - @ team transaction, in which the Padres traded Jake Peavy and catcher Nolan Arenado (along with outfielders Evan Longoria, Mark Kotsay and Zack Britton and infielder Chris Paddack ) for Hanigan. On February 7, 2015, Hanigan scored a career-high 30 points in a season-opening game against the Houston Astros. His final regular-season point in his second season in Tampa Bay was a hit off David Robertson on April 15 of that year. His first postseason point came on May 7 of that year in 3 at 3 games against the Miami Marlins. On June 16, 2015,, Hanigan hit a season-high 13 home runs in a 14 at 14 game against the Cleveland Indians. On July 4,, Hanigan hit four home runs in a 10 at 10 game against the Nationals. In the 2015 playoffs, Hanigan hit a season-high 23 home runs and led the majors with 45 RBI\u2019s. On May 11,, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves met in the 2015 World Series to determine the number one wild card entrant in the National League. The two teams played six games during the regular season, winning four of them by two or three goals. However, a three-game sweep of the Braves by the Dodgers in the post-season eliminated them as the first wild card.\nIn his first season in the National League, Hanigan ranked fourth in the majors with 56 home runs, seventh in the MLB in both RBI\u2019s and OPS+, and 12th in OPS+ among all players with at least 20 doubles. Hanigan ended the season second in both walks and assists, and sixth in BB\/9. The Rays lost to the Miami Marlins in the 2015 Division Series 4 at 3. Hanigan finished the season sixth in runs batted in, second in doubles, second in home runs, and fifth in runs scored. In 2016, Hanigan led the Rays with 36 home runs and finished third among all Rays players with at least 10 home runs. In his second season with the Rays, Hanigan led the team with 63 total RBI\u2019s, and also leads the Rays in runs produced, games played, and number of games started. In the 2016 regular season, Hanigan hit 32 home runs,.353 batting average,.467 on-base percentage, and.636 slugging percentage. On September 13, 2016, he was voted into the 2013 All-Star Game. Hanigan finished the season as the top single hitting hitter in the Rays. Hanigan finished the 2016 season with a.323 batting average,.436 on-base percentage, and.581 slugging percentage.\nAfter Hanigan returned from his injury, he was named the starters infielder for both the 2017 and 2018 seasons. He hit his first home run of the 2018 season off of Yovani Gallardo on September 27. However, he suffered a right knee injury, and was placed on the 10-Day disabled list. On December 4, 2018, Hanigan was named the second starter in the lineup along with catcher Joe Panik. He hit a home run off of Nolan Arenado during the 2018 season.\nAlthough this is the first list I create about the 2019 class, it will remain for the 2020 class as well, I plan to review the entire 2019 class when they enter the Big O.\nThe entire list below includes pitchers and catchers.

{"prompt":"A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September 11 . The storm tracked generally west @ - @ northwestward , affecting several other ships with damaging winds .","text":"A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September 11. The storm tracked generally west @ - @ northwestward, affecting several other ships with damaging winds. Several of the ships were forced to retreat to Plymouth for safety.\nOn September 11 and 12 a series of cyclones struck the central areas of South America. First came the small tropical cyclone, which entered the South Atlantic at Ponta do Grange~y, Brazil, and continued through the central areas of Uruguay, Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay, and Uruguay.\nOn September 11 it passed between Montevideo, Uruguay, and Buenos Ayres, Argentina, where it weakened to a tropical depression. The primary effects of the depression were light winds and rainy skies.\nThe other two cyclones occurred near Puerto Rico on September 11. One of these, a strong tropical cyclone, passed slightly to the east of the island.\nThe effects of this cyclone were minimal.\nThe effects of the other cyclone, also a strong tropical cyclone, were more severe and resulted in severe winds and windthrow, extensive rain, and some flooding on the eastern coasts.\nThe effects here appear to have been limited by the terrain of the island.\nThe final cyclone, the so-called Cape Horn cyclone, originated in western Antarctica on September 9 and spread westward.\nThe primary effects here appear to have been wind shearing and rain in the form of snow drifts on the northwestern coasts.\nNo reports of other cyclones in the South Atlantic during September 20 - December 8 have been received.\nIt does seem likely that a further cyclone will occur near northern South America soon, but this is speculative at this time.\nThe second half of September was characterized by a series of strong weather fronts which advanced into the central areas of South America from the west and south.\nThese fronts gave rise to heavy falls of rain in Uruguay and Argentina.\nThe heavy rains caused several minor floods as well as minor and damaging wind storms.\nThe most impressive weather event occurred in Uruguay on September 30.\nIn the Uruguayan province of San Jose a severe storm brought gusts of wind to 200 miles per hour and extensive rainfall exceeding 15 inches.\nThe most severe rainfall occurred with the cloud-front system on October 9.\nThis frontal passage produced heavy rains and wind damage.\nThe most intense precipitation fell in Uruguay on October 10 to October 11.\nHere the highest rainfall records were set in two localities.\nThe extreme rainfall was recorded from a series of meteorological stations along the southern coast of Uruguay.\nThe stations included Salto, Lake Balneario in the department of Salto, and San Pedro, Lake Lolog near Lake Rosario.\nThe maximum 24-hour rainfall recorded at Salto on October 10 was 16.3 inches with 12.4 inches over a period of 4 hours.\nThe highest rainfall recorded at San Pedro on the same date was 12.5 inches.\nThe maximum 48-hour rainfall was 14.5 inches at Salto and 10.8 inches at San Pedro.\nAt Salto a maximum 3-hour rainfall of 4.5 inches was recorded.\nThe maximum 24-hour rainfall on October 11 measured 11.4 inches at San Pedro.\nThe largest single storm occurred at

{"prompt":"The Duchy of Cornwall continued to own Lydford Castle into the 20th century . Albert Richardson , the architect to the Duchy estate , proposed converting the property into a private house in 1912 ,","text":"The Duchy of Cornwall continued to own Lydford Castle into the 20th century. Albert Richardson, the architect to the Duchy estate, proposed converting the property into a private house in 1912, but the scheme was not implemented. The Duchy sold the property ( and by extension, the surrounding parkland ) to Sir Edward Tuck, whose only son, Richard Tuck, inherited it in 1926. During this period it was known as the Tuck House Estate.\nThe estate was purchased by a New York developer who leased it to his friend, the late Sir Alexander Cadogan. Cadogan's son, the future Lord Cadogan, bought Lydford in 1986 to create what was to be a world famous seaside retreat. The property was given its current title, Tuck House Estate, in 1987.\nIn 2004 the Cadogan family announced their intention to sell the estate, but the scheme came to nothing. Cadogan's eldest son, Anthony Cadogan, who was to inherit the property, died in February of the same year. According to The Times he had recently bought shares in Cadogan Seafood, a New York seafood company that had gone into financial distress. His father had already threatened not to sell Tuck House unless his investment was protected. Mr Cadogan was believed to have suffered a heart attack before his death.\nSir Michael Cadogan, the current Lord Cadogan, stated his son, Anthony Cadogan, had been suffering from dementia.\nLord Cadogan's son, Anthony, stated the estate was worth \u00a3100 million and expected \"to produce double this figure net of fees in the future\". His father had owned the property for 40 years and worked there with his architects and engineers.\nCadogan Palace, a former private residence on the estate, was converted into private dining and meeting rooms known as the White Room, which hosted various members of the royal family including Prince Charles. The White Room was acquired by David Beckham in February 2005.\nLord Cadogan himself lives in The New Gallery, a converted stable yard formerly used by Sir Hubert Parry. His sons inherited a house and house garden known as the Lodge, and an old farm cottage known as the Old House.\nA proposal by The Cadogan Estate was to renovate their entire estate and sell it at auction, to allow them to be rid of the expensive building fees that were due to commence in 2009. The estate are expecting to recoup \u00a360 Million of their \u00a3200 Million loan to build the Tuck House estate.\nA group of Conservative MPs, led by Lord Carnwath, opposed the sale of the estate. A letter was written to Lord Cadogan stating that they would not purchase the estate as it had a great deal of historical value and to allow it to be converted to a hotel. They stated if the property were sold \"we would not be prepared to stand in support of your application\". \nLord Carnwath stated they had seen \"a very different proposal put to them by Cadogan Seafood\" and \"that was based on a very different understanding of investment and the need for the funds to go to an appropriate use.\"\nA report by The Daily Telegraph newspaper stated in an

{"prompt":"Monster was founded in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products . Lee , an audiophile and engineer , was experimenting with different copper qualities , wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables","text":"Monster was founded in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with different copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables when he produced the original Monster.\nMonster, an underrated brand from Japan, is known for their high-end cables. Monster has recently started producing an affordable audio cable, Monster Mini.\nThe cable has a very nice solid construction. Everything is black with good contrast throughout. The cable has a solid copper core for excellent conductivity. A jacket with a good cable structure holds everything together. The cable is manufactured with solid insulated shielding for superior noise isolation. There is a very comfortable cable clamping point located in the center, which can be rotated for fine control. This is very useful and allows fine tunes and an excellent grip for the music headphones. The cable does not use any braid or jacket materials on its core, but is solidly constructed.\nA solidly constructed jacket with a single layer of braid holds everything together. Solid copper cores hold the signal wires securely and evenly, free of any twist or movement. The cable is made very thin at 0.8 mm to save weight without losing any conductivity.\nThis Monster Mini cable sports an interesting and unconventional cable design. It has a very wide cable design with a thick jacket and multiple copper cores. Each core is insulated from the next one. The cable is made very thin at 0.7 mm to save weight without losing conductivity.\nThe cable is made with solid jacket materials to keep noise interference out. The cable sports a wide design for superior conductivity and the copper core is very clean without any damage or breakage on it.\nThis cable is intended for a specific type of cable speaker connection. It has a 5.5 \/ 3.5 audio connection with an XLR plug and offers a very tight binding fit. It is also suitable for use as a headphone amplifier cable.\nThe cable is available in a pack of 3 with a nice black plastic holder for better storage and protection. A very nice cable that does not sacrifice quality for weight reduction.\nMonster Mini is a very elegant and stylish underrated cable. It sounds very nice, but it is not designed to be a high-end audio cable. For an audiophile, it is better suited for a headphone amplifier. On the other hand, it is a great cable for connecting a turntable or a CD player.\nOur friends James and Debi are the newest owners and co-owners of a boutique hotel in downtown Dallas and the first of its kind in the town of Wimberley. We loved getting to know them and their home.\nThe hotel is known under the name of Savanna Inn. We had a great time photographing the owners and their family as well as the building itself.\nThe owners wanted their family to be part of the process of deciding on a name for their business. They also wanted a place that would reflect the family while still allowing them to have a place to open their doors and host guests.\nThe owners met with several interior designers to be able to come to a consensus that best represented the family while fitting into their budget for the project. We could tell that the owners had thought about it a lot in order to get it to the quality they were pleased with.\nWe loved shooting the couple and their family and taking pictures of the boutique hotel and the rest of the area.\nOur favorite part of this shoot was the little things. The owners and children were so nice and so easy to work with and we laughed a lot as we did all of their family portraits.","token_len":733,"entropy":[5.6365,5.9262,0.8514,5.2956,0.9606,9.4243,5.6088,5.3046,11.7249,9.1698,7.0257,1.1514,5.9031,3.3098,3.3396,9.2029,0.131,1.6752,5.7291,0.4011,2.1291,7.4605,0.0538,4.0913,11.8307,8.7977,2.3433,8.4602,9.8781,1.0142,8.8119,2.2773,4.3532,4.02,3.7701,3.9263,0.2794,6.98,1.2654,2.6262,1.2917,2.2026,2.0665,15.5464,4.3596,4.1797,10.1499,3.8496,4.462,2.0395,0.3111,2.2556,2.702,0.3252,1.7105,2.9048,1.7029,1.3816,6.1132,1.9049,2.6556,2.741,5.3188,3.6765,2.6434,4.9478,3.7795,4.4992,0.79,2.5693,2.5824,5.1776,2.1972,1.4011,3.239,4.2475,3.0927,1.1859,3.7794,3.8399,5.5624,2.9038,2.3368,6.6622,0.7513,5.4592,2.41,6.0718,5.1011,6.0383,0.729,1.061,1.8077,1.8531,0.7022,3.8048,4.0983,3.3517,4.9607,3.748,6.023,0.1152,0.6395,4.0844,9.1284,2.7526,1.0906,4.8891,5.1008,6.3746,5.286,3.4073,1.5516,0.8287,1.1234,0.931,1.0106,6.4897,2.6145,4.8394,8.0172,6.7491,2.9906,3.2124,3.933,1.7026,0.59,4.3085,0.5951,0.964,3.3645,5.1064,2.342,7.1203,3.7559,5.7158,5.4457,2.0622,0.1424,2.0242,3.8837,1.8005,3.2941,0.4132,4.295,3.5745,7.2238,1.8974,0.9493,3.4379,2.1239,2.6827,2.4748,4.6615,3.046,6.0003,10.4453,2.9993,6.0647,2.2214,6.4814,2.4931,1.8776,5.0014,8.7814,0.2866,1.321,0.7725,4.8321,0.2037,5.4716,1.5365,6.8713,1.9324,1.7188,7.904,5.2814,5.0706,2.1438,5.5653,1.6197,2.3108,1.9932,6.9822,2.006,1.6365,1.2415,4.0102,9.5013,0.5631,7.9025,2.0955,0.6226,7.0026,3.3773,0.1614,2.4897,0.0116,6.0833,0.8685,0.3096,0.3302,8.671,1.9853,6.3326,2.4023,1.4635,6.6339,6.763,3.8743,1.8691,6.1108,2.369,8.9498,0.7048,1.4016,8.4418,1.3456,4.9422,0.4787,1.0843,0.6069,0.9507,2.0482,8.9283,2.4386,4.0462,6.071,0.0247,3.5408,2.1855,4.7451,6.3544,0.5877,6.5369,3.923,1.7334,5.9467,0.0638,0.198,1.4848,3.726,5.4488,1.5158,1.7675,7.339,2.2768,5.1527,3.9447,8.0043,4.0859,1.3081,0.321,1.41,1.2307,0.5681,2.0492,4.5967,2.3148,4.9918,1.7366,0.741,4.4125,4.8206,2.7727,7.4693,5.585,2.5514,0.7299,4.5711,0.8553,1.0776,5.6865,2.0393,1.3374,7.6477,3.205,1.9048,0.9321,1.356,0.8451,1.9032,4.9201,0.6205,0.5053,0.1319,0.001,3.6813,0.0231,0.548,0.8349,0.0088,0.2669,0.0744,7.3168,0.0004,0.0804,1.3361,1.0662,0.7972,0.7877,1.3108,1.7042,2.0056,9.6021,2.4909,3.2813,2.2599,3.0005,9.772,2.316,0.9213,0.9785,0.702,8.5763,0.3967,5.5511,4.4787,4.002,3.5667,3.7137,0.0032,1.7161,4.0882,4.8524,0.3047,1.1269,2.4891,5.793,6.132,0.6642,4.8099,3.4795,4.1482,0.025,4.7329,3.9133,0.1405,1.1264,2.2654,0.5313,0.7902,6.7186,0.4599,3.9303,4.7606,2.5007,0.0139,4.4463,7.2391,9.9281,0.6916,1.5983,1.9923,0.6706,5.4017,1.4167,0.8515,8.7199,3.7794,0.312,0.4153,6.7976,4.1533,2.4787,2.3334,4.0895,0.0157,5.8567,2.0098,7.1648,1.3542,2.9538,5.0428,7.1416,5.8241,0.6991,2.2577,1.1585,2.2738,3.4012,0.0576,2.8013,2.9541,0.2971,2.6258,2.3445,6.1292,0.7047,0.6298,1.3697,0.8683,0.8017,4.5562,0.1825,2.0367,8.067,0.3453,2.8284,3.4885,1.2706,6.3108,3.6101,4.3063,5.3282,2.5807,4.7321,3.2696,1.4895,2.687,0.2366,3.9781,3.4085,1.4497,3.7554,4.1845,3.4722,0.1128,8.9679,1.9852,1.9232,5.265,8.9663,0.3578,0.6679,2.5118,1.3384,1.4393,1.5009,1.9075,5.9745,1.7524,2.8816,15.3567,3.5472,0.8408,0.8248,7.4154,1.6974,2.0893,1.7707,1.6039,1.4362,0.9759,1.137,4.8282,0.8879,0.5948,2.5863,3.4059,1.1594,0.1509,1.8855,0.2042,0.2666,4.942,4.3142,3.3164,0.005,1.7921,1.2413,0.7585,4.7257,1.3188,0.693,1.6415,3.1164,0.816,1.2645,5.9939,0.3592,0.1759,0.0169,0.0589,1.6789,0.704,1.7546,2.1091,2.043,0.4576,6.483,1.6136,7.2829,0.0001,0.0145,1.6358,1.5466,4.0653,0.0596,0.5055,0.996,7.0977,5.703,8.3236,1.4312,7.3816,4.5109,3.0611,2.5971,6.8481,4.0198,3.824,5.4204,0.061,1.2838,0.086,4.4205,5.5989,6.5903,1.1458,5.0978,4.7425,3.8333,3.2903,3.3215,4.0741,4.236,0.0155,0.8658,0.4037,8.1823,1.433,11.2283,1.1873,0.118,0.7213,1.931,6.9168,5.7085,1.1403,1.3982,0.7445,0.9009,2.6573,5.4093,1.5119,2.1588,2.6631,2.8137,1.1076,4.5459,9.7355,0.5839,0.9673,1.9,9.3893,3.4829,4.1577,1.2889,2.0954,2.8882,1.677,1.7373,0.0875,8.6489,0.0009,1.2411,4.8069,1.2449,1.7096,3.0399,3.0015,1.603,0.0363,2.0832,5.3004,2.9219,0.3123,1.6057,1.703,2.7697,6.0423,3.9979,4.4403,0.6122,1.7826,3.6141,0.0026,0.8485,4.6635,1.02,6.303,1.5673,1.4188,2.1958,0.7349,0.7062,3.5867,0.2733,1.8398,3.7731,0.2059,2.3561,2.7064,1.6558,1.3393,5.1665,1.4007,3.6671,5.5344,1.6263,3.6355,1.8591,0.4518,2.6317,0.9681,2.1509,0.7557,7.7104,0.5405,2.741,1.5354,7.5724,2.8869,0.3623,1.001,1.4933,1.5583,5.9994,0.7232,3.9549,8.9129,0.215,2.225,5.4365,2.2072,0.0032,3.5491,3.1681,1.7028,3.9482,3.1518,7.3787,4.6105,0.6108,2.4034,4.3789,7.3439,1.9554,2.3472,6.1802,4.5404,1.0956,3.3681,0.0715,2.8494,5.4307,4.287,0.9763,1.2095,2.0052,2.7536,5.891,1.0206,3.4956,3.0594,0.5922,4.0261,4.1106,0.0504,2.7973,3.0068,2.3541,1.6867,6.2222,0.8805,1.4785,8.5977,0.0425,0.264,0.7906,1.9323,4.9131,7.2337,1.4996,4.7691,2.0952,1.9612,1.5505,2.3025,5.5968,1.5159,1.2574,1.3144,9.1236,0.8696,2.0648,1.5931,4.3755,0.0491,0.393,3.5064,0.6277,1.4378,3.3635,3.9456,0.9729,0.7615,1.7911,5.1795,0.1838,0.9192,6.5541,4.681,1.7055,1.5149,2.0533,3.116,7.0447,1.2255,2.4365,3.8243,0.7738,5.0855,5.1955,0.1399,3.1399,0.0453,2.4172,3.328,7.0961,3

{"prompt":"Project Chanology began its campaign by organizing and delivering a series of denial @ - @ of @ - @ service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes","text":"Project Chanology began its campaign by organizing and delivering a series of denial @ - @ of @ - @ service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes.\nSince the launch of the Defend Scientology campaign, they have been working closely with government organizations, private firms, and prominent figures \u2013 who have also taken to the streets to protest these attacks on the church. Their activities have resulted in the creation of a new page on the site, \"Protest Against Defend Scientology\".\nThe campaign's main goal is to raise public awareness of the attacks on Scientology. For their part, they hope that any negative information they can manage to collect in the fight for Scientology will be the stepping stone to new discoveries about the Church of Scientology itself and its founder L. Ron Hubbard.\nThe most important and best information is the very information that, in the past, the press has not had access to. If the press were to write about Scientology in terms of what is known about the Church and its leaders, not what the Church has done to protect itself from its critics, there would be a great change in our perception of the Church. The information is there to be seen.\nThis is the result of a long campaign that began with the creation of \"Defend Scientology\" by Chanology. At the time the site launched, it received a lot of support from online newspapers, which wrote an editorial for it and included the link. But this was not enough and the support of the press was required. After all, nobody is going to go to the trouble of editing a news story if the story doesn't relate to the interests of the paper it is published in.\nChanology's members use the Internet to generate and coordinate their campaigns. For example, the very first \"Protest Against Defend Scientology\" page is a compilation of the links that appear on the original \"Defend Scientology\" page and is shared via the popular networking site WordPress.\nChanology was founded in 2004 by two people who wanted to change the way the church looks to the outside world. They did so by giving a voice to the people who are the victims of its persecution.\nChanology has grown from a few hundred members to over two thousand members who have joined more than fifty groups or individual campaigns.\nChanology's work has resulted in the creation of a new page on the site, \"Protest Against Defend Scientology\". The page, which is accessible at the following url: \"protestanddefend.shtp\", includes links to the new articles about the attacks on Scientology on the BBC, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, CNN, Associated Press, and others.\nThere have also been articles about the campaign appearing in the Italian and Russian media.\nThe campaign has succeeded in making it clear to the Scientology leadership that there exist serious and independent journalists.\nSome members of Chanology have succeeded in obtaining access to the records of Scientology meetings.\nThe most significant result that the campaign has obtained so far is that the press \u2013 now that it no longer sees the Church of Scientology simply as a persecuted religion with an important contribution to the history of science and technology \u2013 will become very interested in what this persecuted Church does for the good of the world. Scientologists have shown that they are ready and able to defend the truth, and the people who make the decision in this connection, the Scientology leadership, should not have any excuse for

{"prompt":"The site museum is located 300 metres ( 980 ft ) outside of the Tonin\u00e1 archaeological zone . It possesses 2 exhibition rooms and a conference room . The first room explains the pyramidal form","text":"The site museum is located 300 metres ( 980 ft ) outside of the Tonin\u00e1 archaeological zone. It possesses 2 exhibition rooms and a conference room. The first room explains the pyramidal form of the city. The second one is a more detailed exposition of the archaeological finds and includes multimedia equipment and an exhibition of ceramics and artefacts. This second room has also a room specifically for the display of figurines and reliefs dedicated to fertility. The room dedicated to the excavation itself has a video playback of work videos in progress. The second exhibition room is the conference room which is used for exhibition events and also for school excursions under supervision.\nMonumental structure\nThe largest monument of the site is a rectangular platform with a circular base measuring 9.5 m by 12.3 m and a height of 1.15 m (Fig. 4). The platform has three terraces.\nThe top layer was found to be a fill, that has a thickness of a few centimeters and consists of numerous sandy pebbles in different colours. Some of the artefacts found in these sediments are very well developed, showing that this area was in use from the very first moments of the occupation. From the morphology of the fill and also from observations at the sites close to the platform, it can be suggested that the site was originally covered by sandy soil with water, but later was covered by a hard and compacted layer of sand and cemented with material derived from a river bed.\nThe top layer is the only part where human remains were found (one skeleton and two skulls ) while all other artefacts were found only in the lower sediments. They belong to a period ranging between 200 BC to 100 AD and belong to the Bronze Age. This period is represented on a ceramic panel in the archaeological museum. No human remains were found on the upper layer.\nThe foundations of the platform correspond to a cemented clay layer with sand. This cement was probably mixed with some kind of wood ashes. The clay layer has been cemented above with a sandy layer covered over by a rubble layer consisting of earth and large stones in the upper part, probably coming from a larger, original platform. This rubble layer could have covered the original platform. The rubble of the platform could also have reached the site walls.\nNo traces of water courses or pools could be traced in this part of the area. The water source may have been a lake situated above the platform.\nThe platform was probably used as a platform for large gatherings and ceremonies. This was demonstrated by a reliquary found in one of the terraces. It had several reliefs showing scenes from mythology and was dedicated to the Sun god.\nA small depression in the platform corresponds to an old pit. It may have been used at an earlier stage for garbage disposal and may perhaps also have served for rituals. One possible candidate for the pit is the skeleton found on the platform. It could be that this pit had some kind of connection with the skeleton, but this requires more study.\nIn the two opposite cardinal directions to the platform (Fig. 4), no artefacts were found, however a little distance from The centre of the monument shows signs of occupation as indicated by the stone rings embedded in the filling.\nThe other two platforms were constructed with earth and stones as found in the rubble layer.\nThe monument is now partly covered by a large tree.\nThe monuments on Tonin\u00e1 were found to have connections with the city. It is possible that the larger platform (Fig. 4) was once connected to the city via a canal system (Fig. 8)

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Fowler, who had enjoyed a long association with Barcelona, was offered an opportunity at the Spanish club by a Liverpool spokesman, to whom the player had been sent an offer in April which was eventually turned down. [ 1 ] Despite his long association with Liverpool, Fowler has not won a league title since 1998 ( although he did win the trophy in 1998 - 1999 ). [ 7 ] Fowler has also never won the Premier League Players'Player of the Year award, but reached the final for three consecutive years from 2000 to 2003. [ 7 ] [ 17 ] With his long association with Liverpool, Fowler was also heavily involved in Liverpool's commercial operations. In 2003 Fowler began a relationship with online gaming company Microgaming, with whom he signed several endorsement deals. [ 18 ] Fowler signed a multi million-pound contract with Adidas in March 2005 and continued his association with Microgaming until he announced his retirement in February 2006. [ 19 ] He has made various television appearances with Adidas and the Microgaming Company, as well as appearing on their commercials. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Following retirement, Fowler still remained part of a board of directors for Microgaming.\nBiography\n\nFowler was born Richard James Fowler in Leigh, North Lancs, England. A professional footballer, the nickname for Fowler came from his playing style which involved running down the attacking wing and kicking in from behind the defence, thus avoiding a penalty shot. He played for a variety of non-League teams, but in 1966 began his career with Leigh Spartans, an amateur side, before signing for the professional Liverpool Football Club. He spent two seasons with the club before signing for Arsenal for \u00a3200,000. [ 22 ] He joined Arsenal in June 1968 in the wake of manager Jackie Milburn's appointment and the news he would take Fowler to Spain.\nFowler's introduction to Arsenal proved to be a controversial one, with Fowler being outspoken about his criticism of the team in his first few weeks at the club. Fowler went on to win two FA Cups with Arsenal, including arguably his greatest feat, the FA Cup Winners'Cup in 1972-73. Fowler claimed that he would have won seven if he had not been a member of Arsenal's then powerful and dominant team up for the 1972-73 season.\nFowler made 26 league and FA Cup appearances for Arsenal from 1968 to 1973, scoring one goal in his debut season and two goals in 1972-73. During his time at Arsenal Fowler was an undisputed captain and helped the club to two FA Cup and One League Cup finals winning titles.\nAfter his playing career, Fowler became a television broadcaster for BBC Radio 2. He has interviewed a large number of celebrities throughout his career, including Muhammad Ali, the Beatles, and Queen Elizabeth. He became well known for the controversial interview of Freddie Mercury in the 1990s. Other television programmes he has featured on include Panorama and Good Morning Britain. Fowler was a key figure behind UEFA's marketing of the European Championships, including contributing to the logo and broadcasts across Europe.\nIn February 2013, Fowler launched his autobiography, Invisible, which received positive reviews.

{"prompt":"Gray wolves howl to assemble the pack ( usually before and after hunts ) , to pass on an alarm ( particularly at a den site ) , to locate each other during a storm","text":"Gray wolves howl to assemble the pack ( usually before and after hunts ), to pass on an alarm ( particularly at a den site ), to locate each other during a storm or in winter, and to encourage other animals to take the trail.Howling varies, however, according to time of night or day, locality and other circumstances.Most howls are quite similar.The most common sounds are whistling, coughing, and a deep growl.\nThese sounds, in turn, usually result from a variety of air pressure variations in the throat, or nasal cavities, and may also involve other muscles of the throat, lips, pharynx, and mouth.Although other species of wolf may utter sounds as far as a mile away, they are usually so loud that the howl cannot be heard by most unaccustomed animals.\nThe most effective way of hearing howl sounds is by using a long pair of telephones inserted into the mouth.\nMost telephones will receive calls on short wave and long wave frequencies under all conditions of sound intensity and distance.The two most popular bands on which to use telephones are 4,5 and 6 MHz ( the latter in Japan ), the former being used most commonly in the United States.At longer distances, the receiver may be located at a microphone and the call be received by voice recorders.\nTelephones for the use of wolves ( which are normally not equipped with a microphone ) can be constructed using a small brass tube with a length of wire attached to it and fed through a horn grill at the bottom.\nTo avoid a possible risk of electrical interference with the telephone, all wiring must be covered with masking tape.In addition, the battery must be a deep cycle type.\nIn Japan, these devices are marketed by several companies.The most popular are the Hi-Power and the Hito models of Hiwa, which are constructed with horns made of plastic.Both make high-quality, strong calls.The Hiwa system uses either 12 VDC or 24 VDC batteries and batteries.It has an output volume of up to 20 db and can be used if there is a distance of a few hundred yards.\nThe output volume may be reduced by using a smaller horn.This horn will also be small enough to be carried in the pack on either a harness or the shoulders of the owner.The system as described can only be used at night due to the large amount of electric noise that is produced by the output horn.With the output horn attached to an amplifier, the system can be used day and night.As well as wolves, some of the larger species of carnivores will also howl.\nThe howl is frequently uttered when the animal is alerted or threatened by another animal.\nIt serves to alert the other animal of the presence of predators or potential predators and also warns them of possible attack.\nThe term \u201c alarm or warning call \u201d is sometimes used to describe these species\u2019 sounds, but the more accurate term is \u201c communication call.\u201d\nWolf howls are usually uttered while lying down and while the animal sleeps, as well as during the daytime when the animal is searching, feeding, resting, or foraging.After a period of time, the wolf may stop howling, as it becomes more comfortable and its alertness ceases.Howls may occur if the wolf is alone

howl frequently while searching for food or

{"prompt":"As well as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division , it had reciprocal and square @ - @ root functions , and the ability to multiply by a fixed constant . With an eight","text":"As well as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it had reciprocal and square @ - @ root functions, and the ability to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight digit addition, the CPU had a 10 second delay.\nWhile these are not real world examples of CPU speed, they do show an idea what you might expect.\nThis might also be an interesting question for our group. However, before we do that, I'd like to know how much more powerful the current computers are than the old.\nIf it was a recent example, you can find these answers in here, and this, and this, and also a lot of other questions related to speed over a period of time like how much faster is the cpu at today than 10 years ago, or two years ago, etc. I would say that it would be harder to guess at what a contemporary computer is like, and how it compares to other types of devices, but I am sure that there are a list of comparisons on Google, and also some of the hardware comparison can be found here. There was also a question on the same subject when I visited the University of Washington ( the university I am attending ) and the professor that gave the answer to the first question in this thread did say that the current super computers can go in excess of 1 trillion instructions per second. My understanding is that some research has been going on to make these numbers even greater.\nWhat you might be interested to find out, is what it takes to make current computer designs of the kind of computing power that you were talking about. So, how many transistors are you talking about, how many memory chips, how many chips are needed for the memory banks.\nThe CPU and the RAM ( main storage ) will obviously determine the rest ( in your example, the clock or the clock frequency will determine the speed of the CPU.\nBut I do not think that I can really answer that. However, I can suggest that you might want to ask some students if they would be interested in finding out what a modern chip looks like, if they have some kind of technical background in electronics.\nAlso, if you are doing any sort of research on the subject, you should probably keep in mind the differences between the different levels of complexity and performance of microprocessors and superprocessors, because you might need to change your approach ( or the way you present your research ) once you get to the parts that are more about the hardware design. If you do a supercomputer build project, then you might find it a little difficult to compare the different levels of complexity, because the goal is to simulate a very large complex model. So depending on the time that you have to do that, you might need more powerful hardware than the supercomputer would have. In my opinion, you might want to make a computer to do your project that would provide only a limited performance comparison for different software programs, for the reason that the results will likely change with each different software being used and a large number of such tests will be less accurate, so you will probably end up using only one of those programs. So, if you look online, there are various ways to speed up the simulation run time of different models, and you can use the most suitable one according to the purpose.\nIn conclusion, you might want

{"prompt":"The constitution of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown , and requires any member of the order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be","text":"The constitution of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires any member of the order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be transferred to another status of honour. A copy of the present insignia may not be altered in any way without the consent of the Minister of National Defence.\nThe current insignia is of brown silk. The insignia and its ribbon were approved on August 25, 2006 by royal assent.\nThe emblem of the Order of Canada comprises a laurel crown with the words IN GOD WE TRUST above it, the crown being linked by two ribbon strands.\nThe laurel crown was a design originally adopted by the Order of Saint Lazare in 1685. It was granted to the Order of Canada officially in 1912 by a grant of patent from King Edward VII. The coat of arms featured in the insignia are taken from his coat of arms. The first design shown is the current design except that the laurel crown consists of three leaves and instead of the words IN GOD WE TRUST, it has the letters I.L.T above a palm. The medal represents a soldier's sword resting on a shield held high by the letters. This design was developed after the initial design and has been reintroduced.\nThe initial version of the design used the shield but no inscription. It appeared on medals of the Order of Saint Lazare and later in the Order of Bath and West Mercia, two orders of arms of the British Monarchy.\nThe second version of the emblem is used on the medal issued to the Canadian Forces Order of Merit. It contains a shield surrounded by an outline of a cross. Along the center of the cross is a laurel crown with the words IN GOD WE TRUST.\nThe symbol that the coat of arms contains the letters I.L.T above a palm was changed to show the letters I.L.T above three leaves of laurel.\nThe three arrows were added to the initial design of the emblem to represent the three components of the Canadian national force.\nIn 1914, when the Canadian government decided to issue an Order of Canada medal to all Canadians to commemorate the centennial of the battle of Waterloo, the symbol of the cross outlined by three arrows were selected to represent the three components of the Canadian national force. On June 2, 1915, the first issue of the Order of Canada medal included the three-armed cross as the emblem for all Canadians.\nThe arms of the Order of Canada are the arms of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as represented on the current crest.\nThe current insignia of the Order of Canada consists of a brown stripe with the red cross of Saint George outlined in white. The red cross is represented as outlined in white with the white arrowhead. Under the cross, are blue and white squares, the white cross within the blue square, and the blue cross, with white arrowhead, within the white square. The crown is an oval and the words IN GOD WE TRUST are under the crown with the crown standing on a plain ground. Around the base of the crown is a row of four red ovals. The two left ovals are outlined in white, and the two right ovals are outlined in red with a white border.

The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper","text":"Le Tr\u00e9sor De Rackham Le Rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in Le Soir from 19 February 1943. The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche on 29 October 1940 as \u00ab\u00a0Le Tr\u00e9sor de Rackham Le Rouge\u00a0\u00bb, but Rackham and his assistant Jonny had not yet appeared.\nIn January 1941 Captain Haddock and Professor Tournesol had finally met at a party in the villa of the latter's son, Mr. Tournesol, and were discussing the plans for his forthcoming trip to Tangiers with a few friends.\n\nFilm\n\nThe first American-made adaptation of the series is In the Land of Men, an animated musical drama starring Tom Eyen, Joan Fontaine, and Bette Davis. Adapted from the film noir film of the same name, it released on 7 April 1957 in U.S. theaters and on 8 June 1957 in the British, French, and Australian cinemas. It is also known in Japan as The Land of Men.\nAnother made-for-television film adaptation, by Rackham the Red, was in black and white and was called Black and White. It aired two years later on CBS and was loosely based on the American original. It featured guest appearances by the late Robert Mitchum and Jack Benny.\nA live-action adaptation for the stage was in black and white. The play was loosely based on the original stories of Rackham. It was directed by Guy Kibbee, with Tony Award winner Dick Van Dyke producing the Broadway production.\nThe film adaptation, entitled The Secret of Rackham the Red, is directed by Nicholas Meyer and was released on 19 October 1997.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe first English-language adaptation was a short-lived weekly series in 1972, written by Jim Clark, and produced by David Frost.\nThe BBC television series began in 1973. It originally ran as a weekly series, but over time it expanded and was often broadcast as a series of two feature length episodes. The producer who started the series, Neil Malcolm, left after a few seasons, was succeeded by Norman Martin. In 1981, two episodes were added for a total of five. In 1985, Martin left after a couple of years and was replaced by David Moreton. In 1992 four episodes (three feature-lengths with the fourth cut to half of the original) were broadcast for a total of seven.\nIn 2004, BBC Studios announced BBC One would produce a series of animated television adaptations of its properties, with the first series set to include The Adventures of Rackham the Red and The Land of Men.\nWhen it was announced in 2006 that the first series would be broadcast in summer 2007, it was speculated that BBC Three would receive the BBC One adaptation to broadcast as a three-part serial. In November 2006 three episodes were ordered for BBC One - BBC Three declined to take the series. The subsequent two years saw the BBC's animated series production deal expire, and no television series adapted Rackham the Red and The Land of Men were ordered.\nIn late 2008, it was announced that it would be brought back to BBC One. The series debuted on 25 April 2009, and has aired every weekend since in its original two-episode format.\nIn 2012, the BBC announced it would produce a three-part serial, based on the television adaption of The Land of Men, with a feature-length story to come in summer 2013. The same year BBC Studios also announced plans to adapt The Land of Men into a sequel series.","token_len":737,"entropy":[9.4443,5.8723,0.6492,6.7929,13.5405,2.6763,7.3949,7.6895,10.1778,8.8652,3.9663,4.4464,0.7849,7.4075,6.9421,1.521,4.895,7.7856,0.4384,5.7654,5.6111,3.5436,5.3346,1.1524,1.5355,4.8608,2.5066,0.562,4.6875,8.7499,5.1211,1.0755,5.1856,1.6007,4.3497,3.9231,1.6745,1.4721,3.5982,1.1382,4.5472,1.1712,2.2012,0.0171,2.5899,3.7303,3.0897,4.5193,5.6867,5.8175,9.0216,3.7163,1.6387,0.0539,0.0007,0.8288,4.1662,0.0006,0.9554,0.1084,6.0413,2.4128,2.3055,2.6391,11.7416,0.0004,3.7624,1.3059,4.9681,9.9087,2.4898,3.658,2.0883,1.8935,5.4694,1.76,1.9326,2.8325,3.5415,2.7185,9.3451,4.8134,5.4161,2.3395,8.1257,5.0282,5.4931,5.7697,10.2056,2.9862,5.2189,4.9611,1.6127,3.1391,4.1361,1.4648,1.638,6.7639,0.0365,1.7539,1.8027,6.3054,1.6998,3.5639,0.9034,4.4491,0.7821,3.5599,0.5889,0.0656,0.2645,1.8351,1.7836,2.9102,2.982,1.0774,4.6502,0.7978,4.0553,7.0317,4.2971,0.4355,8.0468,1.6041,4.0298,2.9296,3.4706,2.102,0.4853,2.3543,8.36,10.9024,1.8755,0.0002,1.8312,2.1182,5.507,4.8264,1.0973,6.1537,0.1905,1.5072,4.5797,3.7565,6.5783,1.7009,3.4433,0.1272,5.4464,1.2783,3.711,3.1845,5.9859,4.6087,2.6077,4.5133,11.6859,6.9353,1.3077,6.7589,5.7686,0.0661,0.4124,1.7984,8.6407,0.1848,0.6585,0.7056,9.0272,0.0357,1.2064,0.8419,3.8659,6.6226,0.5283,3.5694,2.006,0.2777,0.0192,0.0988,0.888,1.9415,8.322,1.4215,4.2057,2.5591,6.7571,1.6208,4.5829,0.0709,0.0938,0.0447,0.8373,2.1552,2.1589,4.7073,2.1721,1.9344,0.1857,2.2136,5.4739,4.2386,0.86,0.3287,0.8783,3.9241,2.7813,0.0038,0.2009,1.9246,2.0187,2.6131,4.2613,3.507,4.0551,0.1711,2.0977,5.1345,0.1031,0.3642,0.9182,0.6756,20.0478,8.401,0.7208,0.0645,0.0066,1.9918,0.0145,1.5323,3.1334,1.9621,5.0918,11.6259,0.0005,7.0922,5.2459,1.3176,1.2231,4.2389,8.3727,0.1265,0.0162,3.4039,1.515,5.4646,6.1818,2.3037,0.0904,2.0244,1.2134,4.3067,6.3902,1.2489,0.3747,1.1276,5.2206,2.3448,2.0314,8.2871,0.2959,0.0526,0.5959,3.8228,5.4658,0.82,1.4897,3.9072,7.4814,3.5271,0.5181,3.3452,2.9685,4.3733,4.7582,0.0013,1.2063,4.6795,3.7707,0.7592,0.8895,11.9655,6.0688,0.6069,0.0043,1.2355,5.0049,1.1613,5.6191,2.1075,3.1146,5.7085,0.0482,0.0069,1.9721,1.8853,5.1637,1.2726,5.9708,0.0586,0.0485,0.5898,3.5224,8.9856,1.4082,6.4217,0.0005,3.5416,1.6115,0.9148,3.1132,0.0381,5.7951,5.1905,5.7207,4.5764,1.2227,2.8201,6.7515,4.4008,1.6753,6.2709,4.0547,0.3471,0.0883,4.3905,2.8838,8.4385,1.9186,0.3317,1.0569,8.7159,3.7634,2.6564,3.5198,4.3238,1.7178,5.8891,1.7221,5.2009,0.001,5.5262,0.3357,0.2449,3.3065,3.1859,0.0263,5.7123,4.1124,1.3115,3.6629,1.9555,0.8721,4.1787,2.7229,6.7663,1.5045,1.3236,0.0006,5.7899,0.0101,0.3983,0.0002,1.2443,1.639,4.219,0.3771,0.0974,1.2913,3.4692,2.9002,3.8139,1.703,0.1013,7.7911,1.9433,2.7775,6.6451,1.7435,4.5204,0.3647,6.5102,5.5866,1.4466,3.025,2.3823,0.1152,3.7661,7.6093,0.9527,2.6057,15.4905,5.7113,3.8749,1.3442,5.7445,1.3454,3.1269,2.5419,1.2868,5.8617,1.4283,3.3556,0.4786,2.1915,1.4567,2.0587,1.0027,5.3757,1.1902,1.4402,3.2557,3.1633,1.9103,6.9417,3.7471,2.4726,0.525,2.1274,0.7797,2.36,9.809,2.2734,0.8836,0.6519,1.65,8.8537,5.426,3.9456,0.6452,0.9478,0.9336,5.6247,8.4293,0.5277,4.2086,2.8216,2.4935,1.558,1.9805,1.7835,6.4156,6.3167,0.0378,6.662,6.4044,1.011,3.0218,4.0294,0.8464,5.3361,2.8008,0.816,2.6386,3.4421,1.9596,2.3927,0.1281,2.5733,2.0875,2.5036,2.9568,0.3314,4.206,3.1759,2.8746,2.0414,2.7503,0.0927,1.2831,1.8329,2.3027,0.2225,0.0627,3.3671,8.2354,1.9704,0.5775,1.7929,2.7372,10.1762,0.4461,5.5081,3.1838,2.7816,4.8751,0.005,3.2362,5.1648,2.9893,4.91,7.5037,4.2759,6.9287,3.485,0.3954,1.97,2.3275,0.167,4.8113,2.1973,0.9701,0.1634,0.0118,2.5818,1.8473,1.0805,15.2329,4.2544,0.3586,4.3966,4.0249,2.6986,9.1583,4.2695,1.726,4.6991,1.0528,2.1017,0.5675,6.2037,2.7708,2.762,0.901,4.4384,7.0284,1.4208,2.6512,1.7518,1.1851,3.0671,4.0954,0.3682,6.2924,4.6838,3.3104,0.0212,2.693,0.0006,1.1345,0.0774,2.1885,0.8752,5.4208,0.0201,0.0088,0.5057,1.0702,16.3459,3.0891,0.6593,0.8347,1.5141,3.1766,0.3292,1.4097,2.0357,2.431,0.9862,0.5852,3.9773,1.4582,5.4784,1.1853,0.147,1.813,0.6109,5.4158,0.1319,4.4473,4.7779,0.5943,5.34,1.3464,5.8484,2.0964,3.5646,5.0895,4.6284,3.2638,1.4008,4.441,0.5693,0.4399,4.8535,1.3723,3.0871,4.0818,3.03,7.6383,0.9429,0.6643,4.8617,1.5111,2.3549,1.1321,5.265,5.2923,1.8327,11.8099,0.4818,4.2634,1.8206,1.8797,1.9728,2.4726,6.3,3.7397,4.417,0.9476,1.2864,1.7865,3.9479,6.5864,1.2939,6.6982,6.9996,3.7866,1.4397,1.059,5.0174,4.5152,0.7374,8.2477,16.6622,0.0002,0.9966,0.0072,3.4639,0.4093,0.0347,0.0017,0.0019,1.8613,3.83,0.5492,0.4825,7.108,3.7797,1.9164,0.3605,3.9839,0.1229,0.4378,0.1484,4.3346,0.7112,0.7275,7.9208,0.7167,1.1639,1.5343,0.9914,2.3374,1.9772,1.729,7.5035,1.1494,4.899,2.6766,0.961,1.6641,1.3154,3.614,4.5241,4.6005,4.9798,0.3405,5.3856,3.189,1.0405,4.8198,0.8355,4.0395,1.104,1.0824,0.8913,11.1185,3.2686,0.2302,1.5826,0.7878,0.9997,1.8516,0.3852,3.0185,0.796,3.4163,0.0414,0.0513,1.8509,2.5457,2.2795,0.083,0.6707,4.6891,9.4211,1.66,0.0005,0.8238,1.3221,1.2805,0.038,0.0204,1.5486,2.4655,2.1525,6.665,0.953,0.0052,3.8213,4.4612,4.3921,1.2917,4.7227,1.3608,0.1389,1.5726,6.9

Proteomics has developed into a powerful tool in basic health research, but also into a very practical tool in clinical analysis, diagnosis and drug development for e.g. cancer, neurological and cardiovascular disorders ( Gingras\nIn the clinical application of proteomics tools, one of the main challenges is to identify the protein of interest using proteomics in a sample where both the background and signals can be ascribed to a particular class of proteins. In this case the challenge is to distinguish these two classes of proteins from each other. The latter problem, which is of utmost importance for the development of clinical proteomics, has been addressed in several studies. A variety of methods for classification of individual proteins, where e.g. pattern recognition and other statistical pattern matching techniques are typically used, have been developed. However, most of these techniques have so far been focused on a few categories of proteins, i.e. proteins that are associated with specific diseases or their biomarkers, or proteins that are known to modulate a specific pathway, e.g. in inflammation, or protein products of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The protein-protein interaction is usually characterized using protein complexes.\nAn extended classification of proteins is based on their subcellular localization in e.g. nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi. A special type of proteins that can be found in various subcellular compartments are the transcription factors, e.g. proteins that bind to DNA. Most transcription factor binding proteins can be identified by their subcellular localization. However, this procedure leads to a significant number of false-positive protein identification results. This is due to the fact that, although some transcription factors, e.g. zinc finger proteins, are present at the nucleus, they are also synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles ( e.g. the nucleolus). Therefore, a novel method for the identification of transcription factors by subnuclear localization is required. In addition, a method for classification of subcellular localization for various tissue or cells types is also required. In particular, such classification can be used for the analysis of cancer cell migration [ 17 ].\nIn this paper we describe a subcellular protein localization database which is designed for efficient and reliable analysis of protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes. Our database is based on the latest protein classification scheme proposed by the International Protein Index (IPI) [ 2 ]. The classification scheme is based on information from various protein databases as well as manual curation. The subcellular localization database contains a comprehensive set of protein subcellular localization classes with several examples and comments. These features make sure that the results provided with the database are reliable and robust.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. The first section of the paper presents an overview of the database followed by some results and applications. The latter section presents a brief description of our future plans and prospects.\nSubcellular\nProtein Database\nAn overview of the database\nIn the present version of the subcellular protein localization database, which is the result of the collaborative efforts of various groups, each protein was classified based on an IPI consensus score using the latest version (IPI 2.1). As a basis for the classification we used the information from the following databases: PROSITE [ 3 ], TREMBL [ 4 ],

{"prompt":"In much of the Western world , the introduction of the pill in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use . In Japan , oral contraceptives were not approved for use until","text":"In much of the Western world, the introduction of the pill in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use. In Japan, oral contraceptives were not approved for use until 1985, so data on condom use or on the introduction of the pill are not available until the late 1980s.\nIn the 1960s, the rise of new social movements and the spread of free sex education promoted the development of public, voluntary, family planning in Japan. As a result, the number of couples who reported no contracep tive use in their marital relationship rose somewhat. For example, in 1987, a total of 35 percent of all respondents to the m arital survey reported that there had been no contraception used in their marital relationship in the previous year. By contrast, in 1987, the use of condoms at last sexual intercourse was reported by 42 percent of all respondents. In other words, nearly half of all intercourse between a single Japanese husband and wife was unprotected.\nAn important part of the decline in condom use might be due to the fact that many couples, particularly those who were trying for a baby, started to use condoms only after they thought they had failed to conceive. This is not to say that condoms were not used in earlier marriages or that the use of condom during a failed pregnancy was not a significant deterrent to contraceptive use ; rather, the increase in condom use in the mid-1980s may represent the end of a long sequence of decreases in condom use during pregnancies that had begun in the late 1960s.\nOverall trends in prevalence\nIn this section, I compare the rate of unprotected sexual intercourse in Japan to that observed in other developed and developing countries over the period 1950-1993. These trends have been reported previously using microdata and summary statistics ( Fuchs and Guttm an, 1994 ).\n5\nThe proportion of a typical couple, defined as one m arried man and one married woman on one household, reporting unprotected intercourse with sexual partners of their own and of the opposite m ultiple partner relationships are included under these categories. Other m ultiple ( 2 5 percent ) or single ( 12 percent ) sexual relationships were excluded. A further 5 percent of m ale and 16 percent of m ovember, 1995 woman respondents were cohabiting respondents with a separate living partner, but these relationships were not included in these calculations because of insufficient data.\nF isures 2 and 3 also include, for comparison, data from the 1994 National M arital and F ilial M arital Surveys. These data, collected by Statistics Japan, are based on interviews with single adult respondents selected by the method of systematic am ount, in which w om en were interviewed first and randomly selected men were called a fter a certain number of calls to w om en had been m ade. 6 Thus, w om en who were single and had a partner were more m ore often interviewed than were m ales, because, by hypothesis, they were more likely than were m ales to be in a couple. However, w om en were interviewed more often in Japan even when they were in a couple, as the 1994 National M arital and F ilial M arital Surveys report, because of the higher rate of rem arried w om en who were interviewed in Japan relative to the United States ( M obuchika et al., 1994: Table 1 ).

{"prompt":"Much of Oldham 's history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution ; it has been said that `` if ever the Industrial Revolution placed a town firmly and squarely on the map","text":"Much of Oldham's history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution ; it has been said that `` if ever the Industrial Revolution placed a town firmly and squarely on the map - and Oldham was such a town - this is one of the first things many visitors will remember. In its present-day guise, the area has a reputation for the production and export of textiles, as well as its strong heritage in the coal industry and its industrial heritage, especially in chemical manufacture. This is evidenced by the wide range of museums, such as the Manchester Textile Museum, the old Blackburn Workhouse and the Shipley Foundry Museum. Other local attractions include the famous Wroxton Hall theatre, the old coal pit visitor park, as well as the Bearsden Museum and the South West Museum.\nThe town's name, Oldham, derives from the Old English \" Oldheim \" meaning `` old hill \", the name of the ancient hill to the south of the town. According to legend, there was a place \" Eadheim \", a settlement on the slopes of Oldheim, which became the subject of dispute and the source of conflict between the Romans and the Saxons. Many legends and stories have arisen around this theme, most of them involving King Alfred, who gained control of the site, and the Anglo-Saxon monks, who moved him here in 876 to escape the Viking raids. At this time the site became known as Oldheim.\nOldham was originally one of the five ancient boroughs of Northamptonshire and was granted its first charter in 1263 by Edward I, who chose the site of the present town hall for a permanent palace. Its foundation charter provided that the local burgesses should have the right to hold a town meeting, elect a king and queen, and that the people of Oldham should have a certain number of houses to rent with a tax to support the local church. The town grew and expanded as a trading centre, particularly with trade in textiles and coal, but also with textiles, cloth and woollen goods in general. There is also a tradition that the city's name was derived from the fact that the area's landscape, in particular the hills surrounding Oldham, looked more like that of a Roman town than that of an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The city has received many significant monuments and monuments, many of which are the work of the great Edwardian architect, R.R.Burchard.\nOldham city council is divided into six parishes - Alfriston, Alstone, Bradford, Bearsden, Oldham and Oldham West, with one ward each for the four former. Each village had one elected parish priest.\nOldham has a rich and colourful musical heritage, and has many associations with the world of classical music. Its most distinguished musical figure is the cellist, Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was born in here in 1878 and is regarded as the greatest composer of the twentieth century. In Oldham the music of the composer Alfred Dyer also had a strong presence. Oldham is served by West Calder Playhouse, a large modern music hall.\nOldham was home to the famous circus, the Great White of the East, which consisted of the famous German act Siegfried Lackner and the New York showgirls Bessie and Mabel King. It was established by Charles H. Robinson, an old friend of the family of Robert Stephens, which in the 1970s was acquired by his widow, who converted the circus into a hotel and restaurant with two floors of guest rooms. It had its height of fame in 1906-1907 and made Stephens a wealthy

Two days later , it","text":"A tropical depression formed on June 2. It steadily strengthened and headed in a generally westerly direction. It moved slowly and became Hurricane Ava on June 4. Two days later, it became a hurricane over the Bahamas, then on June 7 it was located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and headed southwest and then west. On June 8, Ava moved over the Florida peninsula before it hit the keys with wind speeds of 175 knots. It entered the Carolinas on June 9 and weakened quickly when it reached the Outer Banks due to high sea levels. A weak banded system moved from north Florida into South Carolina causing a few tornadoes. On June 10, it headed for the Atlantic Ocean across the Carolinas.\nAva made landfall in Florida on June 13 making landfall in Apalachicola with 250 miles per hour head winds and 70 mile per hour winds. It moved rapidly out to sea and dropped to only a tropical storm and then a tropical depression. It dissipated into a remnant low pressure system just north of Cape Lookout, North Carolina on the early afternoon of June 14. The remnant low pressure system moved into the Atlantic Ocean and was replaced by a post-tropical cyclone that eventually weakened to a remnant low pressure system and dissipated.\nA tropical wave developed near the coastline of Brazil on June 11 and headed in a northeast direction. The wave reached the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June 13 and formed into a tropical wave. The wave grew rapidly and by June 15, the center had intensified into a tropical storm that was known as Frances. Frances reached its maximum wind speed of 105 miles per hour at its center and continued to move steadily north-northeast. Frances continued to move slowly when it moved into the Gulf of Mexico on June 16. The storm finally disintegrated into a remnant low pressure system. The remnant low pressure system weakened gradually and lost all tropical properties after it crossed the southern coast of Florida on June 17.\nA second tropical wave formed on June 11. The wave became a tropical wave and intensified to become a tropical storm a few hours later. It continued to move steadily north to a position north of the British Virgin Islands. The Tropical Storm Emily maintained a steady northeast direction until it moved into the Atlantic Ocean on June 13. Emily continued to move slowly into the Atlantic Ocean as it weakened to a remnant low pressure area. The remnant low pressure system dissipated into an extratropical storm after it crossed over the Bahamas on June 14 into a weak remnant low pressure system. The remnant low pressure system continued to decay into a few clouds and rain on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean until it dissipated on June 15 into a remnant low pressure area.\nA tropical wave formed on June 10. It became a tropical wave and then a tropical storm on June 11 and continued to speed northeasterly until it reached the eastern Gulf of Mexico where the storm intensified to become a hurricane. Hurricane Frances continued to move slowly out to sea and made a brief landfall south of Pensacola on June 14. It was downgraded to a tropical depression and disintegrated on June 15 into an extremely weak remnant low pressure system.\nA tropical wave formed over the southeast Atlantic Ocean on the 13th and headed in a generally east-northeasterly direction until it crossed the African coast on June 13. It continued to grow and peaked into a tropical storm on the 15th before the hurricane weakened.

{"prompt":"Although Per\u00f3n had undergone a hysterectomy performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack , the cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly . She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy ( a novel treatment","text":"Although Per\u00f3n had undergone a hysterectomy performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack, the cancer had metastasized and returned rapidly. She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy ( a novel treatment at the time ) which did not stop the growth of the disease. At the age of 31, in June 1952, Per\u00f3n passed away, after a period of recuperation at the residence of Alberto Palacios. She was taken to the Per\u00f3n Hospital a few days later, where he had stayed after the operation. It was the first time that Per\u00f3n came to visit a hospital for an invalid, and for this, it will always be remembered.\nIt was at this moment when Per\u00f3n was diagnosed with cancer that Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte of Per\u00f3n made some dramatic words, which are the most remembered for her. On January 11, 1953, he began his speech to a crowd of several thousand people who gathered in Parque de Mayo. He announced that he suffered from cancer in the stomach, a diagnosis which stunned the whole country. He said:\nAs well, I hope there are no doubt that the Per\u00f3n regime works in favor of the poor, the sick, elderly and disabled, for whom a special emphasis is placed. That is why I am always telling you, so that we can take care of the ones who are sick... Per\u00f3n said... \"\nPer\u00f3n's wife said that he was still alive, but in coma and that he will be dead in ten days. One of his closest political collaborators, the then Secretary of Aviation, Carlos B. De Rucci, said that he should not have talked like that. But Per\u00f3n was always the man who made good decisions. As the disease increased, his speech became shorter. His voice became muffled, almost inaudible, but he spoke, he talked, and he carried himself with confidence.\nThe next thing President Per\u00f3n would be aware would be of the fact that he was surrounded by a great number of followers, and a delegation headed by Jos\u00e9 Eurnekian, which was sent to him from the aircraft. The delegation included four doctors and a nurse. The last one, in an interview, said that the Per\u00f3n was a person who was very fragile emotionally and that the cancer would bring him back in a few days, but would return with additional force the following week. This prediction was not correct. One week after the diagnosis, on January 22, 1953, Per\u00f3n died in the house of the doctor Miguel \u00c1ngel Piovra.\nIt was in that same house that Per\u00f3n's body was placed, before being taken to the Per\u00f3n Hospital. She and her son Juan Carlos arrived in private automobiles as shown in the photograph with the rest of the Peronists. The two daughters, Carmen and Mar\u00eda Isabel, did not come. As he was dying, Per\u00f3n's will was made public. In his last will, with the firm hand of his hand, Per\u00f3n asked for the body of his wife to be buried on the grounds of the Per\u00f3n Hospital.\nOn January 24, at the age of 36, Per\u00f3n died, while his name was in his heart's blood. His death took Argentina by surprise and turned into a national tragedy. A week after the first statement with regard to Per\u00f3n's health, the government was forced to change the name of the state that he created: the Province of Buenos Aires.

{"prompt":"On 5 October 2005 , a reporter for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast","text":"On 5 October 2005, a reporter for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast by the BBC2 English series \" Playing With Fire \". The production is intended to adapt the novel from Sense of Scandal to Sense and Sensibility with only one major difference: instead of having five characters there will be four. Also the characters are based on the Austen character Mrs. Bennet's four daughters. On 15 October 2005, Graham Norton on The Graham Norton Show said that the script is not finished, just half a screenplay and one page of dialogue. On 20 October 2005, BBC said it would not make a public announcement on the show's details before it is fully developed in the screenplay stage.\nOn March 2006, BBC2 announced that the drama adaptation will be a 10-part drama and the BBC2 series Sense and Sensibility will air from 29 March 2006. After an ongoing bidding war, the BBC bought the television rights of the books to be broadcast in the UK to United Artists Television, for a figure not disclosed. \nOne of the producers of Sense and Sensibility, Simon Wincer, is not in charge of the adaptation, thus he has his own ideas of what the show should portray, and one of the most important of those is the possibility of having some characters be played by actors famous outside the BBC. Also the filming locations will be decided after the end of the series. Wincer had not watched the books for years, since the adaptations he had seen of Austen's books had \"just been terrible\". For their part, the directors said that they are familiar with the text (they own the rights of the books), but that they will base their own interpretation to the adaptation. The actors are still to be named.\n\nFirst season (2006).\n\nThe original television series Sense & Sensibility will be produced by BBC Two and directed by Andrew Davies. The new series will be based on the novel and will cover the first five books of the Austen novels, Pride & Prejudice, The Two aunts, Emma, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The show will consist of ten 50-minute episodes. It will start airing on the BBC2 television channel on 29 March 2006. The BBC will produce the series and is in negotiations to air it in the other BBC programmes. The adaption will cost a total of \u00a350 million. The series will be based on the six novels, and will end at the end of book number six.\n\nReviews.\n\nThe series was mostly received by critics positively. The series was praised by critics' consensus, which awarded it a score of 88% based on reviews from 20 critics. The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gave the series a score of 92% based on 45 reviews. The review aggregate website Metacritic gave the series a score of 72 out of 100, based on 26 critic reviews.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 92% approval rating based on 45 reviews and an average rating of 7.47\/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Sense & Sensibility is the sharp, brilliant TV debut of BBC Two\u2019s first original adaptation of an Austen work, and it\u2019s an instant classic.\" On

{"prompt":"Difficult conditions greeted the teams upon their arrival at the Silverstone Circuit , as parts of the Midlands received a month 's rainfall in the space of two days . The torrential rain lasted throughout","text":"Difficult conditions greeted the teams upon their arrival at the Silverstone Circuit, as parts of the Midlands received a month's rainfall in the space of two days. The torrential rain lasted throughout the day and the conditions degraded further during the evening session.\nIn spite of the wet weather conditions, the teams put in maximum effort to qualify on the Friday day, hoping to achieve a better time than on the previous round in Donington Park. Unfortunately, they did not manage to do so, with only a marginal improvement in their personal best in the afternoon session caused by a minor problem which saw the left flap on his Williams be removed from its holder and leave a hole in the engine compartment.\nIn spite of an inferior qualifying time to pole position, Nigel Mansell completed the race in second place, having started on the wrong front wing. The British driver qualified ahead of his Williams brother Gerhard, who qualified a further lap worse than his team mate. Rolf Stommelen was able to establish himself in the top ten position when he qualified in tenth place on his March, but the same result was not enough to take him to the front. The German team was also disrupted by engine failure in the second qualifying session, as the engine was removed from its holder and left with a hole in the bottom part of the engine compartment.\nRalf Schumacher qualified in eighth place on his March. The German driver managed to outstrip all his opponents when he took a two-seater to the apex, but the top speed was not sufficient to avoid being caught by the back of the Williams driven by Mansell. The Williams driver managed to continue despite the forceful impact with his March and even then managed to pass Schumacher with some margin. A further move by Schumacher on the inside of the Williams resulted in his March sticking in the grass, and the engine subsequently being damaged. Schumacher completed the race in third place, the same position as in the qualifying session.\nNiki Lauda was able to qualify in fourth place with his Lotus, ahead of both the Sauber team and the Brabham of Jody Scheckter. Niki Rindt was the only Sauber driver to put on a clean skin around the circuit and therefore qualified in twenty-fourth place. Ralf Schumacher was not able to qualify despite putting on a second skin on his March as was expected.\nIn the final race of the season, the French Grand Prix at Rouen, French Grand Prix winner Jean Behra was unconvinced by both his March and Williams, as both the cars refused to respond to his driving style. He had already won the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim to claim his second consecutive Grand Prix title, and although the French Grand Prix was in his grasp, he decided not to participate in a race that he considered lacking the intensity of the previous races.\nThe Williams of Mansell was the only car to put in a run in the first two races of the season. Mansell was able to outstrip Scheckter in the French Grand Prix in an opening race that would be remembered for the accident involving Williams driver Emerson Fittipaldi, and he scored the first pole position for Williams. Mansell also won the first race of the season at Suzuka, securing his first victory of the season. Following this victory in which his brother Gerhard was injured in an off-the-cutting incident, Mansell retired from Formula One on 18 December.\nHis retirement coincided with the end of three weeks of celebrations in the United Kingdom for the Queen's Golden Jubilee, and Mansell was due to return to his home in Northern Ireland on 12 January

Alabama opened a 21 \u2013 0","text":"In the 75th edition of the Iron Bowl, the Auburn Tigers overcame a 24 @ - @ point deficit to defeat the Crimson Tide 28 \u2013 27. Alabama opened a 21 \u2013 0 lead on Auburn\u2019s last drive of the 1st half and Auburn fought back to tie it at 21 with less than five minutes remaining in the game. Auburn then scored seven unanswered points, capped by a 13 yare run by Justin Jefferson to take a 26 \u2013 21 lead with 8:59 remaining. Junior QB Jake Fromm had his second consecutive triple-threatening game, completing 17 of the 28 passes he threw, while the offense registered five rushing TDs, four of which came from Justin Jefferson. Auburn was unable to prevent three turnovers that allowed Tide to tie the score for good 27 \u2013 27 on senior quarterback Justin Moore\u2019s final ball of the game. Fromm had 10 of his 20 passes targeted for big gains.\nAuburn will play in the Iron Bowl for a 3rd consecutive year on the road against Oregon State in Pullman Thursday, Oct. 2. #IronBowl2019 #RedPineVolts\nIn the 74th edition of the Iron Bowl, the Auburn Tigers overcame a 38 @ \u2013 @ point deficit to defeat the University of Connecticut 28 \u2013 23. Auburn\u2019s offense began its offensive drive the same way it began its 2nd half offensive drive: by driving deep into UNC\u2019s two-yard-line. The Tigers had a one-yard run down the right side of the end zone, then Auburn took a 7 \u2013 2 lead when senior fullback Justin Jefferson hit a 47 yard TD. The Tigers scored two more times on UNC turnovers, but it was UNC\u2019s defense that held up for the most part as they registered six interception recoveries. The Tigers struggled to gain the necessary yardage in the red zone, as only three of Auburn\u2019s 30 drives had the ball inside its own 10-yard line. The Tigers could only convert 7 of 28 PAT opportunities, and only two of their 24 converted punts.\nAuburn will play at Indiana in Indianapolis Thursday, Oct. 2. #IronBowl2019 #RedPineVolts\nIn the 74th edition of the Iron Bowl, the Alabama Crimson Tide overcame a 9 @ \u2013 @ point deficit to defeat the Auburn Tigers 23 \u2013 20. After trailing 9 \u2013 0, the Tide rallied from a 9 point deficit to defeat the Tigers on their home field. UNC dominated most of the game, but the Tide\u2019s defense held the Trojans offense to just 12 points on 23 total field goals, including 7 PAT conversions. Quarterback Trey Lance completed 23 out of 33 passes, and converted 3 of 5 extra points attempts. The Tide was able to generate some yardage in the red zone, making 5 of 8 extra point attempts. The Tide converted 5 of 10 punt returns for 20 yards, but suffered a turnover, which led to Georgia Tech scoring on 4th and short. Auburn\u2019s two turnovers on 4th and 25 late in their possession helped the Tide pull away after making the extra point to tie the game 20 \u2013 20 on a field goal by senior wide receiver Ronnie Price. The offensive line was able to force the ball away from the Georgia Tech defense and Auburn\u2019s running game contributed 13 of the Tide\u2019s 25 offensive yards from scrimmage.

Personally, Santos led a life of excesses and indulged in alcohol and cocaine use; the latter probably being due to his desire to lose some weight that weighed him down. But it should be noted that he also played the piano and played a small role in a group called La Brea. In 1936, Santos performed with a band called the La Brea Band, including Miguel Aceves Mej\u00eda and Johnny Pacheco, and after playing in several clubs in Los Angeles he joined Los Pepes. From this time Santos was known as Johnny Pacheco. In 1937, he was hired by Columbia to record a song in which he sang \" Que Ser\u00e1, Ser\u00e1 \" with Oscar D Le\u00f3n. This recording was the soundtrack of the popular film, The Big Parade, written by Oscar D Le\u00f3n and directed by Ray McCarey.\nIn 1939, Santos led the rhythm section called La Brea, which later recorded under the name The New York Rhythm Section.\nSantos joined the Buena Vista studios in 1940 to record his first album, In 1940, Santos played bass for Tito Rodriguez, who would later record for Columbia. The first recording session for which he is credited with vocals was in 1940, when the singer and songwriter Willie Col\u00f3n recorded a song dedicated to his brother. In 1948, Santos was fired from his position as bassist in the orquesta de Roberto Roena for refusing to drink alcohol. Santos became known to be very strict with his musicians and to not tolerate any drinking; his band members would sometimes wait with their drinks in the studio. With the passing of time, he was able again to return to the job of bassist, mainly in the orchestra of Roena. It should be noted that Roena also played as piano soloist. During the 1940s, Santos was part of several orquesta, such as : El Nuevo Mundo ( 1944 ), La Mexicana ( 1945 ), Las Musas ( 1947 ), and El Gran Caribe ( 1948 ). Despite his great success in these orchestras, he remained loyal to Roena and became his pianist when Roena asked himself to leave.\nAs a pianist, Santos became a member of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where he performed during the 1957 and 1959 tours in the United States and in 1959 in Cuba. Then, in 1961, he was invited by the Cuban Festival of La Habana, where he performed alongside the Cuban Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica. During his stay in Cuba, he returned to his home country and became a member of several orchestra, such as La Sonora Santanera and the Tropicana Orchestra, where he later became the president of the band. The Tropicana Orchestra would later join with Santos and the group recorded together, including \" El son de la negra Tomasa \" ( a song on which the orchestra did not give credit to Santos ) and \" La Malague\u00f1a de mi barrio\". During his time, he was considered a great master of the music, being known throughout Latin America as the king of salsa. During his time, he recorded dozens of albums. In 1972, he created, with Johnny Paredes, a rhythm section called Los Pepes, which is considered a pioneer in the history of salsa.\nSantos had no children.

{"prompt":"Slimmy started working on the album with his longtime producers Quico Serrano and Mark Turner by the third quarter of 2009 . Saul Davies was first set to be the producer of the album ,","text":"Slimmy started working on the album with his longtime producers Quico Serrano and Mark Turner by the third quarter of 2009. Saul Davies was first set to be the producer of the album, but after hearing some demos and some of the tracks, he withdrew from the project citing a lack of cohesion and the album's overall musical tone. He said, \"It all sounded too generic, with too many beats that didn't really work\". Instead Slimmy chose long lost friends Quico Serrano and Mark Turner to co-create the album. In an interview with Dazed, Slimmy said of the album: \"I don't think I was that focused on the music at the time. I thought, 'Well, Quico, Mark, you know, we know each other, we've worked together, and I wanna do something that's honest about ourselves.\". Slimmy wanted the album to be uninhibited, telling Dazed: \"It wasn't about getting a record with every single part of what I think is a good song. I didn't get that, and I was just trying to get this unedited record of the way I thought a good song should go.\". Following the death of long-time collaborator Mark Turner in late 2008, Slimmy worked with his friend Quico Serrano. Quico had produced his first couple of records; he had also been a member of a band called The Vampi Boys. He previously worked with Slimmy on the band's first two albums The Future and The Best Way to Die. Slimmy had not previously worked with Quico, though he has worked with other members from the band including Mark Turner and Robb Williams since then. The duo worked intensively on the album with the album's release as the deadline.\nOne of the main influences on Slimmy for the record was the film Easy Rider. He told Dazed: \"It always made me think a lot about what's truly important in life, the things that matter, and there was a lot of music that made me think about things like that.\". While working on the album, Slimmy was introduced to music from the band The Fever Dogs, who had been performing by the streets in L.A. since the 1970s. The Fever Dogs helped to bring him back to his early love of punk and garage rock. In 2013 the two collaborated on the track \"Run Away\", a cover of the song from The Fever Dogs.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe record was heavily criticized by music critics and music aficionados. In September 2009 Slimmy wrote in his blog \"Basically, that's a really good record. I get a lot of feedback saying, 'OK, this is just like my first record, but I'm not sure you can even hear the comparisons in this record.' A lot of people are surprised that it sounds as fresh or as original as it does.\". His bandmates have also defended his record stating that they felt the critics were missing the point of the album. They have also stated \"Slimmy is not a punk rocker anymore\" as per a comment to AllMusic by Mark Turner. In his book, A New Musical Genre: The Evolution of Hardcore, Steve Turner, who was one of the members of the early hardcore punk groups such as The Fever Dogs, said the album does succeed in a \"revolutionary\" way he had never heard hardcore punk before: \"It doesn't just sound more refined as it evolves, it also sounds more like something that would have been popular in a more civilized society.

On 11 October he was promoted to vice-marshal. After the Directory established a government of the people on 10 December, Villaret was appointed a senator of the first order and created a general of division on 21 December 1794.\n\nDismissal from office\n\nAt the end of March 1800, Villaret reported to the Directory that he was considering resigning from office, partly due to ill-health but principally out of ill-will towards his former commander, Bl\u00fccher. He was a firm advocate of the principle that a general who has been defeated should be stripped of his command. But, with an order from the Directory in his hand demanding his resignation, he remained in rank. He was reinstated at the end of 1806, along with Bl\u00fccher. In 1813, Villaret received the Legion of Honor. His younger brother Louis (1779\u20131859) was a military councillor.\nIn February 1814, after the Battle of Waterloo, Villaret received an offer of an appointment as vice-president of the French Senate, on the condition that he resign from the Directory. The Republic, however, had already been dismissed by Napoleon and it was therefore not possible, during the First Coalition, to grant him office. Under the terms of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, Villaret was appointed deputy to the Legislative Assembly (France). On 6 July he was sworn in as deputy to the legislative assembly, taking the portfolio of the interior office. He was unable to prevent a crisis at the legislative assembly. On 1 August he was formally deprived of his seat.\nIn his early career he had been a staunch defender of Napoleon. In 1805, when the Emperor took a leave of absence, he was a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the activities of his rival Marmont, and spoke boldly in condemnation of him. In the wake of the abdication of Napoleon, he joined the army of the First Coalition. In 1809 he was appointed to the general staff commanding the 3rd corps and received the rank of Mar\u00e9chal de camp, the third rank in the military. In 1814 he was a member of the commission that was formed to assist the regency in the preparation of the new constitution. In later years he was a member of the military commission for public safety, and also served as a member of the commission of government, which prepared and prepared the decrees and regulations of the Directory.\nHe was appointed lieutenant-general of gendarmerie of the first staff (1816) followed by the position of commandant (major-general or equivalent) of the general staff, of gendarmerie (1814). He held this position from 1815 until his death, and was commander of the general staff of gendarmerie in 1824, 1825 and 1826. He also served as governor of Saint Helena.\nAt the fall of the Empire, Napoleon retired to the castle of La Malmaison. He died there on 5 June 1821 (age 85) and was buried at the tomb of his father, at the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery.

{"prompt":"Only one son of Djedkare Isesi has been identified for certain , Neserkauhor , who bore the title of `` eldest beloved king 's son of his body `` . Neserkauhor also bore the title","text":"Only one son of Djedkare Isesi has been identified for certain, Neserkauhor, who bore the title of `` eldest beloved king's son of his body ``. Neserkauhor also bore the title of `` first among his royal sons ``. The other sons were known only by their father's titles, which indicated which king they were sons of. Neserkauhor's father, Djedkare Isesi, ruled between 1115 and 1133 B.C. We know a few things about Neserkauhor from the inscriptions found in his palace. In one it is stated that the son of Djedkare, Neserkauhor had two daughters. He had more than one son, so the palace inscriptions must have been inscribed at various times during Neserkauhor's reign. It is unlikely that the palace itself was only inscribed after Neserkauhor's death.\nIt is likely that the second part of the inscription on the table is what remains of an inscription on the wall. The first part of the inscription would originally have read \" In the palace of Djedkare, king of Djed, Neserkauhor and his sister, Djehu. \" Djehu means the second of the two daughters mentioned in the inscriptions on the wall. These inscriptions may have been written to commemorate some important event or as a personal honour. To write in the palace of Djedkare as a king is to acknowledge the king's right to rule. This right in Mesopotamia was acquired by blood as the descendant of a king or line of kings.\nThe third inscription on the wall shows that Neserkauhor was killed in battle, but not by whom. The inscriptions in which the names of the kings and their reigns were written were erected in a royal city outside Danzig in the vicinity of Esagila, although this site itself is unknown. The most prominent feature of the city was the temple it bore on the slopes of a hillside overlooking the town. The city of Danzig existed in the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. and was inhabited by a strong and proud people of the Sumerian ethnic origin. They were a rival of the neighboring people of Lagash.\nThe third inscription may seem to have something to do with the fight against the Persians ; if it did, this would mean that the battle was fought by some troops sent from Danzig in support of the Persians. If it refers to a battle fought by the local people against the Persians, then it seems to have been fought by them about the same time as the final war. However, in the inscriptions found outside Danzig there is no mention of any battle fought by the local people against the Persians.\nIt was also the time of the great expedition from Babylonia against the city Dura in north-west Iran under the command of the king Anu-ninukhat, who was also known as Dadu-bani-Dagan. When the commander of a large army sent an emissary to Danzig seeking an alliance, Neserkauhor declined the offer and sent an emissary back to the king of Dura, in the first letter sent into Dura by the Babylonians. Later on, when Dadu-bani-Dagan went to Danzig to take back Dru-gamma, the latter sent Neserkauhor to Dadu-bani-Dagan in return. It was here that Neserkauhor was killed, probably on one of the road to Dura, or perhaps in an

By moving the centre of government ( more or less formally ) to the imperial palace of Rome, he effectively made himself ruler of the world. The empire was thus no longer viewed as a republican enterprise and its successors in the 4th century would no longer question its legitimacy.\nIn many respects, however, Domitian proved a poor administrator. Although he had been initially encouraged to adopt an autocratic dictatorial style of rulership, he soon abandoned this tactic and adopted a more conventional style of rule which would be adopted by all of his successors. A new form of government known as the Diocesan system was introduced at Rome, and soon every province of the empire became divided into a number of large cities ( Dioceses ) governed each by a priest or Bishop as its ruler. The provinces themselves were ruled by an imperial officer known as the praetor who controlled a number of small cities as well as a much larger city called Rome. These cities were responsible to the praetor, and each had a number of small magistracies, some exercised directly by Emperor, some by his officers, and some by an assembly of citizens. The Diocesan system attempted to limit the power of the emperor, but its primary effect is to ensure an efficient distribution of responsibility among many administrators \u2013 and this system has been widely copied in modern western countries.\nThe second major reform Domitian inaugurated was the establishment of the Diocese of Rome, the seat of the empire. Domitian established a number of great palaces, each intended to serve as a symbol of the emperor\u2019s power. Of particular note is the Colosseum, a huge structure built above ground which, with its grand entrance, was a massive and imposing reminder of the emperors new power.\nAt the turn of the 3rd century, the Empire of Rome had become a large and complex political structure. Its central core, the Roman State, was relatively small in comparison to the number of tribes within its borders. Even within a city like Rome, the state was far from homogeneous. All too often, there were two or even more sets of citizens competing for power or influence among the state\u2019s institutions. The Emperor, on the other hand, was, by most definitions, still regarded less than fully legitimate. Although he had adopted a new form of government and been elected or chosen as its ruler, he was not necessarily accepted within the state as a lawful ruler. Indeed, the very notion that the emperor was a lawful ruler in fact gave the Romans a legitimate source of complaint and a reason for continual protest and opposition. Domitian was not immune to these problems, and he was forced to accept a compromise, the adoption of a new title, \u201cImperator Caesar Augustus\u201d, to signify his superior legal authority over the other members of his family. His claim to \u201cCaesar\u201d, however, was less than fully accepted by all Romans. The word carries the implication that he was a member of some hereditary family, and in fact he had two such families on his side \u2013 the Caesars and the Claudians. Domitian sought to limit the number of members of each family in the Emperor\u2019s household by introducing an alternative title \u2013 \u201cPapa\u201d, meaning \u201cgrandfather\u201d. \u201cGrandfather\u201d, however, was not a title that was generally taken as being legitimizing, and no one readily accepted the title. A number of his successors, however, were more successful than his father and brother at gaining official legitimization.","token_len":754,"entropy":[11.8047,1.9524,8.4243,3.6331,0.221,7.8333,7.1055,0.5016,0.4395,1.1538,11.2822,8.0795,7.6294,3.6901,4.8782,3.9411,0.4255,5.7695,3.1976,2.1195,2.8299,0.9488,5.1412,6.9033,2.6257,7.2672,0.1471,5.1863,5.2364,13.1308,2.6555,0.0016,6.0483,3.5758,1.3113,0.7032,6.5097,1.3226,3.76,2.3205,0.4745,2.0284,4.4846,4.0749,2.9069,5.08,0.7479,0.7269,2.8465,0.8083,2.7121,4.2033,1.4707,4.1376,4.6093,0.2109,6.5561,0.2521,0.8608,7.6975,3.9743,2.9356,3.4,6.2158,4.2102,1.4093,7.3344,0.0275,0.8316,4.8129,5.035,0.3486,8.4822,2.3369,0.8587,0.6072,1.4739,4.7494,5.4598,2.4448,0.4278,3.0893,0.0034,2.6389,0.0032,0.0036,6.83,2.7392,7.0206,6.2672,1.0416,4.5442,0.7328,2.1106,2.6577,6.8339,6.3705,0.9263,4.0644,3.217,4.8473,0.1178,8.2059,0.0727,0.5812,2.2913,6.7297,0.0081,0.4061,0.889,1.8495,3.9243,1.1514,5.4488,1.2668,3.6438,0.845,0.8289,5.1359,2.4076,0.4028,2.2559,3.9903,3.1685,2.844,5.2187,0.6365,1.7509,2.6694,0.9374,0.2733,0.579,4.9472,3.7266,2.935,0.0152,1.0725,6.447,0.0255,0.8725,7.5715,0.8894,2.1874,3.8677,1.1641,2.411,3.6018,2.797,2.2589,2.4821,4.5958,6.6504,4.1264,2.4172,0.4014,1.0602,3.7928,5.2157,0.3398,3.5012,4.494,0.0082,5.7526,3.0167,2.7764,8.2561,0.2274,2.0045,1.7665,3.1071,4.2278,6.9321,0.9932,0.7434,6.2182,3.0309,5.866,5.4589,5.5977,3.7936,0.2225,1.6391,5.5941,3.8835,0.8043,4.3698,0.2783,3.9077,4.3314,5.4948,3.8132,0.077,1.0161,6.0731,0.0213,0.3948,4.1381,5.2949,3.4773,3.5163,0.0045,3.8505,2.9606,4.3253,1.4222,0.0235,1.6824,6.9397,0.3533,3.6322,0.8889,4.8277,0.8141,3.182,1.2839,0.6642,6.2769,4.7067,0.9372,4.407,0.005,0.2886,3.1652,1.9853,3.8668,3.1961,1.5838,3.0789,0.0182,4.6966,5.7993,4.6956,2.602,0.3954,2.4773,3.6921,11.2126,5.266,0.3223,5.2984,4.194,1.1226,0.7106,3.5341,4.93,1.1277,0.3682,0.5677,0.7424,5.011,3.9089,0.2687,5.0593,0.989,1.4553,4.8233,0.0079,0.6233,0.2886,7.6292,0.1051,4.3704,0.4129,1.4205,0.0889,0.6865,1.929,1.8896,1.3041,3.6509,4.4792,3.5285,5.5484,0.3866,3.1168,4.4348,3.5786,3.307,0.0387,7.9791,1.962,4.6619,6.9448,5.8449,2.9729,2.3024,4.4304,3.1183,1.3251,3.0061,5.9738,1.8686,3.3136,5.3434,2.314,0.5228,0.8621,1.7827,5.3958,1.6585,2.9382,6.9984,0.0019,0.0023,7.8858,0.0002,0.7494,0.633,2.8372,0.0132,1.3402,4.6967,3.1735,0.2966,2.0363,1.8794,3.1525,6.1515,0.0398,0.7731,5.0157,1.0597,3.0679,0.0016,0.0139,2.9805,1.1802,2.1059,0.0021,5.1114,6.5022,0.0054,1.7444,4.0786,6.404,0.4265,2.2558,0.606,0.4093,6.298,0.1892,0.8501,3.3908,15.1194,7.2151,7.617,2.2349,1.0687,6.0826,2.6171,1.7529,1.8718,0.2934,6.3573,0.398,0.0191,0.0021,0.8322,1.898,4.6427,4.2255,2.6137,5.909,3.6538,3.3437,3.2589,3.4033,0.7439,4.6285,3.8587,0.7356,2.2913,3.2645,5.3854,3.3311,2.7087,6.4428,0.0444,0.3416,5.367,0.067,8.0022,2.4693,1.0075,2.2051,4.7728,0.7067,4.9428,0.0005,0.0127,3.6207,0.012,0.0382,0.3229,1.3185,4.2114,2.4636,1.2581,2.3242,2.4871,1.6816,4.4414,1.6819,2.3001,4.0212,2.9089,1.2695,3.256,3.5589,6.3916,2.3168,1.1714,3.5817,4.8825,0.25,0.813,6.5788,1.6122,3.297,3.5608,0.3782,0.8859,3.9252,0.0354,8.0366,4.1298,1.7994,1.2087,0.7177,5.6969,2.9207,3.4204,3.764,1.9578,0.1269,0.2868,1.3766,4.1958,0.9302,4.7808,1.1868,5.0937,0.3862,0.8136,5.0264,6.1698,0.1808,0.4388,4.1733,0.605,4.006,1.0769,2.6763,2.3492,8.0591,0.0103,3.5334,5.263,0.4498,1.5876,4.6048,2.3297,3.8549,1.3016,5.6304,13.2418,0.1891,0.1596,6.4055,0.5718,1.9268,4.1765,1.8759,3.8128,0.0218,0.0979,0.0024,0.012,1.0508,5.2355,2.8746,5.092,4.5282,0.0614,6.5863,4.8898,9.2395,2.0072,4.9089,7.5128,1.8659,4.2396,1.0878,1.6969,5.6626,0.9893,4.0546,1.2577,0.0084,0.6838,3.689,6.6512,3.6327,7.243,4.6758,2.2566,4.385,1.9681,0.7264,0.8399,1.3732,1.9163,4.3848,6.8269,4.3214,0.4551,2.8185,1.5822,0.9332,8.0163,1.7353,0.5131,4.6351,0.0588,2.4607,4.444,2.8756,1.8284,1.8585,1.95,1.1021,1.7697,2.4485,0.1923,3.5653,4.5737,4.6863,2.5487,4.1849,1.2271,5.5901,5.5102,0.0821,9.1072,2.0239,4.0177,3.748,1.0708,8.0984,3.3805,3.3555,3.2056,0.9549,3.4847,0.0021,0.0055,2.5464,2.6677,6.0338,0.5368,2.3507,3.4662,1.573,1.9858,2.0624,1.7951,4.3347,0.1379,3.6795,1.8476,4.482,3.9565,3.4135,3.8592,0.017,1.242,1.4067,6.8075,1.0661,10.9508,6.1547,7.0676,1.6375,2.2152,5.5396,3.893,2.7876,7.0246,2.1231,3.3516,7.1117,1.3936,6.1119,7.2518,0.7989,2.6485,0.5392,4.4715,3.663,0.0137,1.5555,1.9318,0.3991,4.5193,6.1777,0.3659,11.4288,0.0832,4.9961,0.0011,5.1473,0.5021,3.0473,1.4824,0.0085,0.7193,5.2959,1.4341,4.4434,2.8209,1.1757,1.9576,4.7103,0.764,2.4433,6.6743,11.2319,2.7384,3.9932,0.5788,2.4611,0.7804,2.1367,5.8829,0.0198,3.8377,5.8893,2.4695,1.3378,1.9073,4.1132,1.3288,2.1229,2.3198,5.254,4.281,1.6217,5.1828,0.777,1.7184,4.0008,1.7212,6.1124,0.0971,0.1022,0.3916,0.3718,6.0849,0.2565,0.3102,3.4573,0.0013,0.0073,6.4688,0.282,5.3205,0.596,2.6794,0.0278,4.0394,0.2623,4.637,0.3678,2.9621,1.1401,5.2123,3.4473,0.1742,0.0697,3.3471,2.3951,4.3577,2.9158,4.6159,1.304,3.3655,2.8264,0.5938,4.7539,6.0857,1.7172,0.6444,0.8571,3.2427,4.5077,0.1914,7.6763,1.9646,1.8401,0.8418,0.7085,6.4237,0.0414,6.6371,0.1551,1.1074,0.0098,2.2764,1.6722,0.0067,0.7347,1.5235,2.1904,3.1321,1.7871,1.7537,5.0664,6.3055,2

{"prompt":"The boundaries of two parliamentary constituencies divide Oldham : Oldham East and Saddleworth , and Oldham West and Royton ( which includes the town centre ) , represented by Labour Members of Parliament Debbie Abrahams","text":"The boundaries of two parliamentary constituencies divide Oldham : Oldham East and Saddleworth, and Oldham West and Royton ( which includes the town centre ), represented by Labour Members of Parliament Debbie Abrahams and Anthony Hayes respectively. Oldham East and Saddleworth are two Conservative-led districts which are the most economically deprived areas in the borough.\nOldham East is an ethnic minority district : this is the third largest concentration of ethnic minority people in Lancashire, with a small proportion of ethnic minorities belonging to other religions, namely the Sikh community and an Islamic family. There are also a number of other large ethnic minority groups, including Bangladeshis, the Chinese Muslim Community and the Burmese. Most people of Asian origin who live in the town are migrants from Bangladesh and India.\nOldham West is a traditional Conservative area with a high percentage of Roman Catholics and small numbers of people who are of other religious faiths, namely the Sikh community.\nThe proportion of elderly people is considerably higher than expected in both districts ; Oldham East was the second most elderly district in 2001.\nOldham East is the most affluent borough in the county as per a housing classification made by the English Housing Survey team.\nIn 2010 the average salary for men was \u00a343,650, compared with the average for metropolitan areas of \u00a341,300, the national average being \u00a339,200 and the average for South Manchester being \u00a340,750. Average earnings for women were \u00a333,700, compared with \u00a331,100, and \u00a337,450 for metropolitan regions, the national average being \u00a331,700, and the average for South Manchester being \u00a334,900. Oldham had the second highest percentage of the population below the poverty line ( 5.6% ), with 6.4% of people below that in the borough, which is slightly above the county ( 7.5% ), but very low for a UK City or County borough ( 18.4% ) and also lower than the national average ( 17.2% ). The percentage of families who benefited from food banks was 6% in Oldham East compared with 5% in the rest of the borough.\nThis website presents a snapshot of Oldham, as it currently appears, and is a living document. Please feel free to share your comments, opinions and suggestions with us and send us comments and submissions for inclusion here. We welcome contributions from students, academics and other interested public at large.\nThis website provides access to public administrative information held by local authorities ( councils, and their quangos ) and other statutory authorities. The information includes public records held in libraries, archive departments and on site. Information is grouped by area and is linked to pages relating to other areas. We have worked hard to ensure that the information is easy to use and relevant to local people.\nThe main objective of the NMP is to improve the quality and relevance of data held on people, by local and central government, as well as other organisations, and create stronger relationships between such data and their uses e. g. for research, statistics and statistical modelling. This is achieved through regular feedback from users to the NMP and local and central government, through improved access to the database, stronger links between data held by the various authorities and greater use of information and statistical models for a better understanding of social issues.

A unique word (a single word, no hyphenation - \u00ab un seul mot \u00bb) is used in the names of wines in the Languedoc in lieu of the French \u00ab de \u00bb or the Spanish \u00ab a \u00bb. The meaning of the word must be understood by the buyer; a wine named \u00ab Cigoland \u00bb has to be considered a \u00ab cigoland \u00bb and not an \u00ab aigre-doux \u00bb or a \u00ab rouge \u00bb. As regards the other terms of origin, the meaning must also be understood by the buyer; a \u00ab cuv\u00e9e sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb is a \u00ab cuv\u00e9e \u00bb and not a \u00ab sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 \u00bb, etc. The wines of the Languedoc enjoy a great deal of freedom in their terminology both in the name of their commune\/village and in their names of grape varieties. These wines are often produced in a single commune (Corbi\u00e8res, Minervois, Faug\u00e8res, etc.) and in a limited area.\nThe common name (French : \u00ab appellation commune \u00bb or \u00ab indicatif \u00bb) includes the name of the commune of cultivation and of the name (in Latin) of the grape varieties used. It is usually followed by the name of the wine (in Latin language) and also by the appellation (ex.: Vin de pays de Carcassonne \u00ab Vin de pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Carcassonne \u00ab Vin \u00bb). The common names may also include names of villages (\u00ab Vin de pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Cezanne \u00ab Vin \u00bb) or of communes (ex.: \u00ab Vin du Pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Mirepoix \u00ab Vin \u00bb).\nThe other classification, the classification by appellation (French : \u00ab indicatif g\u00e9ographique \u00bb), is also known as the traditional system or the first classification system established by law in 1938. It distinguishes wines according to the names of the commune of vegetation and of the name (in Latin language) of the grape variety used. The indication may include the name of the variety (ex.: \u00ab Vins du Midi \u00bb) or may include the name of the commune (ex.: \u00ab Corbi\u00e8res \u00bb, \u00ab Vin de pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Minervois \u00ab Vin \u00bb). The other terms of origin (French : \u00ab appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \u00bb or AOC) are wine zones (\u00ab vignoble de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Corbi\u00e8res \u00ab vignoble \u00bb) with a specific geographical indication that are subject to official regulation and to mandatory control. The other terms of origin are also the subject of a common denomination and are associated with one or more grape varieties: \u00ab vin de pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Minervois \u00ab Vin \u00bb or \u00ab Vin de pays de \u00bb \u00ab de \u00bb Faug\u00e8res \u00ab Vin \u00bb, wines produced exclusively in one or more communes in the name of one or more grape varieties.\nThere is also a collective common denomination (French : d\u00e9nomination collective) or collective indication, the name of which indicates the name of a wine production area.

{"prompt":"On 1 July , an Italian armoured unit arrived in Gacko to reinforce the garrison . An Usta\u0161e operation to clear the insurgents from the Stolac district began on 3 July , meeting with success","text":"On 1 July, an Italian armoured unit arrived in Gacko to reinforce the garrison. An Usta\u0161e operation to clear the insurgents from the Stolac district began on 3 July, meeting with success until 26 July after which, with their supply lines cut, the rebels fled. The units of the Slovaks who defended Gacko and other Slovak towns were defeated. On 3 July, the Army of the South destroyed the Stolac Bridge. On 25 July, the bridge and the surrounding area were captured by an armed group of Slovak rebels called the \"White Army\".\nAfter the failed Gacko Incident, the Usta\u0161e garrison in the town, commanded by Jozef Sokol, was reduced and the units sent to the border regions. The Usta\u0161e resistance was broken and the Usta\u0161e army retreated to the Liptov region, where it remained until the spring of 1939. After the capture of Gacko by the Soviets in January 1939, the village, once called Torgolj, was renamed Stolac.\n\nPost-WW2\n\nIt can be assumed that many of the towns and villages in the area were left under Soviet occupation until 1944, which makes it impossible to verify exactly how many refugees had ended up in Gacko, how many were able to settle there, and to what extent the region was populated by displaced Germans.\nIn August 1944, the village was occupied by the Germans a total of nine months (July 1944 to December 1944). There were many German refugees, with families being settled in Gacko or in neighbouring villages. In the summer of 1944, the Germans left the villages in the area, and the locals were unable to rebuild. Several people living in the village, who were relatives of the previous owners, lived longer in a place that had been abandoned for many months. Many people who were relatives of the previous owners survived in the village. This was partly due to the remoteness of the area and the lack of transport in the countryside. Most of the inhabitants of the village who were relatives of the previous owners moved to nearby villages like Tatransko, Orahov or Orahov nad Labem.\nIn 1947, the population of the village was slightly more than 2,000, mostly Slovaks and German, but there was also some Jewish inhabitants. During the communist years, the village was under government control, and in the 1950s it was almost entirely Slovak-speaking.\nIn January 1957, there was a local Communist revolution in Gacko. The leaders of the Communist party demanded the resignation and resignation of the former mayor of the village and his deputy. The Communists also asked the Soviet authorities to give them the power to govern according to the constitution of the Czech Republic. The communists succeeded and forced everyone in power to step down. The communists forced the leaders of a conservative party to resign from their posts as well. The communists also demanded to have the schools re-designated as \"Soviet schools\". Gacko, and the towns and villages in the area, remained under communist rule until 1989.\nIn 1989 the village was briefly recaptured by the communist government. Despite this, Gacko did not become the centre of an independent movement of the village during the Czechoslovak Revolution, despite being a very important military garrison to Czechoslovakia. The communist regime in the village was dissolved in 1990 and the residents were free to choose to move to another place in the country.

{"prompt":"During its lifetime , a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed , either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis ( the process of programmed cell death ) .","text":"During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis ( the process of programmed cell death ).Some cells die by means of apoptosis and undergo morphologically distinct cell death known as pyknotic ( condensation ) or apoptotic bodies.\nOn the other hand, apoptotic cleavage is a form of nuclear decay observed after the formation of a DNA double-strand break to initiate the DNA unwinding ( the apoptotic process ).\nThe nuclear proteins ( nucleases and DNase activators ) found at the time of the breakage of DNA make the nucleases active.\nOne of the DNA helicases named WRN and FANC G proteins have been implicated as a catalyst for the breakage of DNA in nuclear fragmentation.\nAlso, the apoptosis inducers have been shown to play a role in the caspase-mediated cleavage of proteins ( p16\/Rb, p53, hTERT... ).\nThere are two basic models that explain the mechanism of apoptosis ( the classical apoptosis model and the model based on mitochondrial disruption ).\nThe classical apoptosis model is based on the activation of caspases which trigger changes in chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane phospholipid asymmetry, and the loss of membrane integrity and the release of cytosolic proteins.\nThere is a growing evidence for mitochondrial involvement in apoptosis ( the mitochondrial theory of apoptosis ).\nThe mitochondrial theory of apoptosis is a new paradigm for understanding and treating apoptosis that was first postulated in the literature in 1985.\nThe mitochondria can only transmit signals when they are intact ; however the mitochondria dysfunction in the cells can lead to death.Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cells that synthesize ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) to supply energy and also generate reactive oxygen species to control the cell growth.\nThe cell has a defense mechanism against apoptosis by releasing active caspases out of the mitochondria.\nSome other pro-apoptotic signals which activate caspases may come from cytoplasmic kinases ( for example JNK ) or from lysine-specific demethylase which lead to the acetylation of histone.\nFinally, there are inhibitors of apoptosis proteins that might prevent the caspase-3 activity.\nThe nuclear fragmentation can be seen as nuclear DNA repair ; it involves the fragmentation of DNA and can be initiated both in the process of apoptosis and cell division.\nIt is suggested that the nuclear fragmentation in the early stage of apoptosis is important for the elimination of the dying cells by the phagocyte system.\nAlso, in the late stages of apoptosis this fragmentation helps in the cell selection and allows cell to continue its DNA repair and genetic mutation to produce next generation cells.\nIt has been reported that the apoptotic cells are selectively destroyed.\nThe elimination of apoptotic cells is also associated with the activation of phagocyte cells ( the CD4+CD8+) which mediate the cell death.\nThe CD4+CD8+ cells can also release the protease that kills the apoptosis cells ( the granzymes ).\nIt seems that in the process of apoptosis there is a nuclear fragmentation that is independent of the activation of caspases.The nuclear fragmentation can occur during apoptosis and it is an essential step to initiate the process of DNA repair.\nThe DNA fragmentation is usually caused by the DNA topoisomerase cleavage by endonucleases, but it is observed that the apoptosisinducing proteins play a role in the cleavage of DNA that leads to the nuclear fragmentation.","token_len":757,"entropy":[5.7361,7.2294,0.2657,4.8534,9.7186,5.0617,1.4322,5.2454,1.9377,4.1994,3.3958,2.4119,4.7321,2.7879,1.3577,2.6508,0.0219,4.9742,0.6198,0.2674,2.1204,0.5493,2.559,0.0027,3.79,0.0658,3.0518,9.411,3.6327,1.4036,6.8449,0.1825,0.0582,1.1335,11.6531,3.7434,4.0307,3.6438,5.6472,0.0737,1.1186,0.0631,2.9079,6.2431,7.4931,3.9867,2.7629,2.4253,1.1543,8.4368,0.018,7.6395,8.6627,6.0954,3.4474,5.1248,11.1696,0.2902,0.8432,1.1562,3.1865,0.6831,11.5922,1.5461,3.6852,14.0201,0.4892,0.2699,0.0205,0.046,3.5987,2.0814,11.589,0.1102,1.9138,2.4237,5.1953,0.0304,4.6167,4.7992,7.279,5.0327,2.2932,3.7898,0.0318,1.2387,6.0338,6.3335,3.3072,0.0355,1.7387,1.58,6.6505,4.1296,1.3571,4.6926,9.884,0.2717,3.8614,4.1825,6.4453,0.8593,1.141,0.4561,1.493,1.9813,4.1771,7.0396,3.3369,3.9576,5.4579,1.8054,8.339,2.5766,9.2774,0.1649,0.3898,5.273,3.5785,0.5781,6.4048,0.1104,1.7073,3.8707,3.8568,1.9352,1.4563,5.2154,3.1296,2.7633,1.2492,3.0163,1.6409,1.9216,4.6454,0.9367,0.0773,6.2958,5.6513,3.7039,6.28,12.1727,4.0132,3.2811,5.1665,9.9093,9.888,5.7676,3.7049,0.925,3.6668,2.3487,2.5176,5.7438,0.2991,0.906,3.7635,0.6658,0.1344,0.6746,3.3182,5.3427,7.7998,1.1783,0.9573,6.5022,1.1437,1.6073,6.1796,1.6261,4.4058,10.4762,3.8816,0.4513,1.9109,0.0874,3.7704,0.402,0.7561,0.0981,0.7393,7.4255,2.2267,0.0285,0.656,5.8377,3.8614,0.0229,0.2265,4.3394,2.2703,5.7799,5.8184,5.6599,6.0234,5.6936,3.1402,1.4702,5.3321,1.4691,5.7436,7.0536,4.2477,8.5921,1.3591,0.3866,4.2451,0.6355,2.1603,3.9401,5.4471,3.4131,1.7857,0.4084,2.513,0.4613,1.7702,0.0198,3.3871,3.6185,5.9918,5.1523,0.1056,0.6212,1.278,0.1139,4.3764,4.8622,0.1783,5.8317,5.8529,0.9987,0.7387,0.7878,0.1029,0.6197,0.0244,0.0893,1.4891,1.5898,0.0781,0.6942,4.4648,0.0466,4.212,0.0185,1.0489,4.034,5.5414,6.2199,0.0689,7.3692,0.0669,10.5768,0.0367,2.4604,4.577,1.6292,0.8431,5.9654,3.1264,3.0919,0.0026,1.3025,6.4479,0.0536,0.682,1.0846,2.6631,4.472,0.0309,3.001,2.4018,3.1568,3.3659,3.7588,0.0319,3.9613,0.1474,0.6653,3.4553,1.1837,0.6901,4.1804,1.3029,1.386,5.7015,3.7754,2.5326,4.2923,5.6615,0.1922,1.2108,0.0283,1.9052,4.2919,2.357,6.7867,1.4112,0.1529,0.003,0.959,0.4611,1.52,1.2017,0.3763,0.3529,0.0252,0.0002,1.2746,2.8028,4.979,3.7129,1.8775,1.2139,3.9112,2.9024,2.5295,0.0435,4.7456,4.1268,1.9118,7.7107,0.0099,0.8647,0.9553,7.1043,1.2901,5.1978,1.1359,0.6321,1.4456,3.8618,0.0745,4.277,4.3731,6.8626,1.5157,4.7419,1.1168,0.5522,6.6516,8.5011,3.1031,4.1399,2.9092,0.0616,11.7694,3.2072,1.5917,4.1172,2.7795,2.0648,0.0145,4.7594,1.6554,8.7704,0.0002,0.2754,1.2564,2.6348,6.951,0.4463,0.554,1.1065,2.8759,2.749,5.9528,0.0494,3.4095,2.6671,8.3867,0.0148,0.005,0.4573,0.0031,0.0,0.0081,0.994,3.019,5.3658,1.3195,2.187,5.302,3.5219,4.9725,0.0127,0.0162,5.0284,3.7824,1.7403,1.2213,5.8043,1.2483,0.8108,1.6033,4.1212,3.9965,1.5982,7.892,1.3004,1.0728,1.3666,0.1236,1.8144,3.5942,7.6303,3.1657,0.02,0.5108,8.3384,0.0877,0.8235,0.9069,0.0478,1.048,0.7114,5.0536,4.7211,6.3591,0.9229,1.544,0.005,0.1815,6.0853,5.2367,5.1104,1.5202,0.0005,0.6235,4.7586,4.9841,0.141,5.4315,0.2787,0.0436,0.0003,0.1724,6.5839,0.5,0.9405,7.1988,0.2546,7.7992,1.1156,2.7369,2.0681,1.4047,6.372,0.0365,2.5553,3.6369,4.7965,9.1907,0.0691,3.0686,4.4338,7.8885,0.0453,1.6025,8.388,0.043,0.6021,0.1327,4.4744,0.9048,4.9882,0.2411,6.4746,0.215,2.4997,0.7844,8.9254,0.4903,1.5727,0.1518,8.1682,2.5104,4.6576,3.9209,1.0461,4.265,0.0011,0.1452,1.4098,8.8037,4.5423,1.5616,0.4207,1.7951,4.7938,6.9497,5.1588,1.1019,3.5881,1.6283,6.758,2.932,4.4145,8.4101,2.6785,4.3722,1.1083,5.3667,0.0597,1.3666,2.3747,3.9344,1.1151,3.7952,7.5304,2.6241,0.687,4.8675,0.0155,3.4066,0.0214,0.4821,4.9981,2.2084,0.4257,0.3031,3.599,0.651,4.4044,0.0855,1.0228,2.5554,1.5924,3.7254,1.3905,5.5901,2.8071,0.3667,1.091,0.0029,1.4545,5.6497,0.8225,0.6768,6.7944,0.0441,1.7184,8.6223,0.4969,3.6861,1.4158,7.4773,0.5639,2.7751,5.6095,0.8753,0.3834,5.5778,0.2727,3.3485,0.9312,3.6926,1.0165,0.1928,0.3916,0.001,5.5597,4.5353,6.8585,3.2824,0.5237,3.0847,8.7341,1.6297,7.0497,3.715,4.1217,4.0822,2.237,6.9534,1.279,2.9236,6.7777,5.1548,4.0159,4.926,7.2789,0.1733,2.217,0.4409,0.2467,2.9759,2.0075,0.19,2.8803,0.1016,1.208,2.7987,1.3265,3.5102,2.2172,6.4702,2.8286,4.1279,0.4146,1.7088,7.6496,0.1308,1.4741,1.7421,0.2136,1.7669,3.2209,3.0483,0.0025,0.9157,3.495,0.0249,4.7987,0.0429,2.0099,3.0495,2.5153,2.9961,8.2925,1.289,0.4619,3.5443,0.8453,5.4988,1.5188,6.9871,0.0096,0.6909,2.0872,2.1677,1.4071,0.1929,1.5919,4.3805,0.2204,0.055,0.4596,0.0252,0.1377,2.637,2.9783,1.9174,4.7724,2.7061,6.4104,1.1516,3.2726,4.9539,0.8053,1.9651,2.8385,1.0872,2.3542,1.44,8.8232,12.6204,0.5893,1.7821,0.2771,3.0209,4.6358,0.229,3.5896,0.7608,3.7443,0.0138,0.5621,0.0044,3.3735,0.5977,0.7041,4.635,4.0203,2.6785,1.6836,6.1216,0.1171,0.6639,4.3294,0.0226,1.8715,0.0008,0.6976,0.838,6.7771,2.4493,0.3314,2.0335,3.4258,3.0277,2.6147,0.0557,1.6245,2.7482,1.1582,4.634,3.9981,1.5922,1.788,5.215,1.0106,3.5786,0.1833,4.1511,1.5198,0.9596,0.3518,1.5986,4.9859,1.3229,1.6668,5.2289,2.7566,0.0911,1.3054,4.9875,9.1531,1.611

{"prompt":"The process of building skyscrapers became more sophisticated , starting with the acquisition of the real estate needed for the site . Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual bits of land required","text":"The process of building skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition of the real estate needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual bits of land required for the building site, in an ongoing process that lasted sometimes from 5 to 7 years. An important figure in this process was the real estate agent of the company, who sometimes would even be responsible for the construction of the building. The architect responsible for the plans would often have a strong influence over the construction process, and sometimes was able to stop the work on a construction site because he objected to the use of specific materials.\nDuring the late 19th century the most popular style, and the one being used by architects such as H.R. Giger, was the Art Nouveau. They also used Neo-Gothic or even Gothic Revival. The trend during the late 1850\u2019s and early 1900s was that the facade of a building was very elaborated, with many columns. There were also two trends that used to be prevalent. The first which is called the High Line Style, which was characterized by a high, elegant and symmetrical fa\u00e7ade. The other was the so-called Shallow Line Style, which was characterized by a fa\u00e7ade that looked lower than the surrounding buildings.\nOne of the more spectacular facades to be seen in the world is the Church of Santa Maria Novella, that was one of the first to use the High Line Style architecture. The most iconic church you will find in the area of Rome is the Basilica, built in 1526, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. But you will not find anything more beautiful as the Church of Santa Maria Novella. This is due to its grandiose fa\u00e7ade, the columns which it holds, the roof and the ceiling that are adorned with religious images and gold.\nBesides the Church of Santa Maria Novella, you will find a number of other churches and monasteries located a few kilometers from San Marco in Venice.The most beautiful and impressive is that of S. Petronio, that was built in the 7th century. You will also find the Church of S. Nicola Assunta, S. Maria del Popolo, and above all, S. Maria Delle Grazie, which stands out from the others due to its architecture.\nOne thing that must not be confused with the churches of Santa Maria Novella, Santa Maria del Popolo and S. Petronio, is S. Onofrio. Many people are mistakenly saying that these are the churches, but they are not, although they could be considered to be almost the same. The church of S. Onofrio is indeed a church, but it is not the one we mentioned, as it was built in the late 12th Century. Its peculiarity is that it was built on a very small area. The church was renovated in 1320, but it was demolished again due to the plague of 1348.\nThe most interesting aspect of this church of Saint Onofrio is that it was the church of Venetian merchant Giordano Tissot, who started a religious order and founded the Venetian Hospital in 1297.

In Poland , until 1831","text":"In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or knots of colored ribbons pinned to the hat, to denote the nationality of their military. In Poland, until 1831, military officers wore wigs called kolacze ( i.e. \" cock \" ), which were colored red, blue, or green according to the military rank. Such wigs were adopted in other Eastern countries from the 17th century onwards, usually using bright colors such as yellow, red, blue, green, purple, or silver. In the 19th century, British and other European soldiers began to wear bands around their hats, which, with colored ribbons or the colors of the country's flag, served to identify the service. In Britain a system of cockade flags was used in 1815, the colors being White for the Imperial Yeomanry, Scarlet for the Irish Guards, Orange for Madras Native Infantry, and Blue for British Army Volunteers. When Britain adopted the Union Jack in 1821, British Army Volunteers no longer wore blue cockades. The color blue was also used as a flag color for other national contingents in the 18th century. Later in the 19th century, the French military began to adopt colored cockades to allow different colors to be worn by specific members of service in wartime.\nIn the Middle Ages the color of a religious order was often the color of the order's dress - green for the dominicans, black for the hermites, red for the franciscans, etc. The order's badge was also often worn around the neck, the colors of which ( white, blue, or red ) were similar to those of the order's dress.\nSome religious orders ( such as the Capuchins, Franciscans, and Carthusians ) wore a red, white, or blue cross on their hats to signify their allegiance to the pope. In 1620, Pope Paul V imposed on them a special coat of arms with a black cross on a red field ( a pattern which became common in Catholic countries long after that date ).\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries red and white were also the colors which were often used to identify the militia or volunteer units of the Catholic Church. At the same time, the colors were also adopted as official colors of the Church in some countries such as Poland. Some other Catholic orders became known for using black, since it was this color which represented the pope. The coat of arms of the Jesuits and Dominicans was blue. This color was also adopted by various religious orders and secular groups in the 18th - 19th centuries in many Catholic countries, such as Portugal and Spain.\nIn 1787, the U.S. Army adopted the color blue as its flag color, and in 1818 the blue became the official color of the U.S. Navy. In the 19th century, the British Army in India adopted white and blue for its infantry forces by 1831 and by the 1840s blue had become the official uniform color for all British troops outside Britain. This color remained in use for many decades, until being replaced in the 1980s by the olive drab coat of arms.\nFrom the 17th through early 19th centuries, some Protestant denominations were known for the wearing of colored hats to indicate their membership in or fidelity to a particular church ( red for Lutherans, white for Calvinists, black for Freethinkers, etc ). Other Protestant soldiers often wore their cross, or badge of membership, on their hats.

By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point where people were able to make bread from just wheat, unleavened, and in cakes.\nThe earliest bread found in England was probably made in Roman Britain in North Wales. The Celtic word for bread appears in ancient Welsh texts as \u2018 brydd\u2019, meaning white bread. Other Celtic words for bread include \u2018llyn\u2019 meaning bread, \u2018dely\u2019 meaning whole meal bread, and \u2018tud\u2019 meaning flours of bread made by grating or crushing wheat.\nThe Romans introduced bread and flour into France and Britain. The word for flour in Latin became fari, which eventually developed to be our word for flour. The word for bread in Latin became paur or pan, which then evolved to be our English word for bread.\nIn 1494, English author Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a poem called \u2018 A Plea for Bread \u201c, in which he described bread as a \u2018dish of gold like a lady\u2019s face. \u2018 The poem was an early reference to the connection between food and the human face or face. The early 17th century poet John Bunyan also wrote about the connection between bread and the human face in his epic poem of The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress.\nAround 1350 an Italian Jewish baker named Niccol\u00f2 Piselli in Florence was the first to make bread with two additions \u2013 yeast and lemon juice. The addition of yeast raised the chances of bread rising in place, instead of rising up. The addition of lemon juice gave the bread a nice green colour.\nBread is the food prepared as the result of the pastry technique that produces bread dough and bread made with flour. For centuries, bakers have used many methods to make bread. The ingredients for bread may include water, flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, egg yolk, fruits, nuts, other foods, and liquid substances such as honey, vinegar, oils, and molasses.\nThese ingredients are all incorporated together under the heat of the baking pan until a dough is made. Bread dough is produced by mixing dough ingredients together to make it easy to shape it into bread shapes.\nToday bread is often made with all-purpose flour. All-purpose flour is the common type of flour used to bake bread at home. When baking bread, a basic recipe may call for a combination of two to four of the following ingredients \u2013 flour, wheat, liquid starch (or water ), yeast, and salt.\nIn a basic bread recipe, flour is needed more than any of the other ingredients. Flour is made from corn, wheat, or rice. Flour is ground into a fine powder that is used to make dough. Flour is also used in pastries and cakes to produce a thin pastry that can be coated with a thin layer of butter or other fat.\nCereal grains such as rice, wheat, corn, bulgur, buckwheat, barley, oats, spelt, and rye form the basis for flour. Cereal grains grind into flour to make bread and other foods. The first method for using grain to produce flour was to grind cereal grains into small pieces.\nThese ground cereal pieces were then mixed with water and other ingredients to turn into dough. Another method was to pulverize cereal grains and use them as a whole to make flour (bread dough). The use of wheat flour and other flour materials began in the middle west around the 1500s. They started to arrive in Europe and Asia and brought with them different names for

{"prompt":"To connect to the Atlantic and Pacific line in the quickest way possible , surveyors and engineers for the California Southern pushed the route through Fallbrook and Temecula \u2014 bypassing what was , at the","text":"To connect to the Atlantic and Pacific line in the quickest way possible, surveyors and engineers for the California Southern pushed the route through Fallbrook and Temecula \u2014 bypassing what was, at the time, the California State Capitol in Sacramento \u2014 and the city council ultimately approved the line over Temecula. But in the midst of all this change, there were small things that remained pretty much unchanged.\nAt the first stop on this year\u2019s road trip, we left California\u2019s southernmost town of Fallbrook \u2014 and climbed to a hilltop overlooking Temecula Valley \u2014 to enjoy a lunch of chili, salads, and sizzling cheetos, while listening to some pretty good music from local bands. The food and music were all part of a community outreach event called \u201cCommunity Kitchen Night,\u201d organized by the City of Temecula in a partnership with various organizations, and held at the city\u2019s Community Center on the eastside.\nOnce there at the Community Center, we were greeted by another couple, who, as it turned out, were a neighbor and business partner of mine. \u201cWelcome to Temecula,\u201d my friend said, before introducing me to her friend, a very attractive lady in a dress that I instantly liked. \u201cMy name is Angela, this is my hubby, Steve, and we own an auto parts business called Vintage Car Parts.\u201d\nIn a separate interview, Angela and Steve shared more about their business and our conversation continues for a bit after the break....\nAnd yes, they do have many old cars for sale, although I didn\u2019t get a chance to see any, since I was on my way to a different restaurant to meet with my friend.\nHaving arrived late in the day, I didn\u2019t have to take a photo until after our food and I wanted to capture the beautiful coloring of the trees and leaves against the orange glow of the setting sun.\nThe City of Temecula is not your typical urban setting. It\u2019s a very rural town in almost every way \u2014 except the population. Just over 34,000 people live in the city, split between the town of Temecula (near the airport) and the town of San Vicente (near the coast).\nThere are about a dozen restaurants in Temecula, and they\u2019re all under the same umbrella organization, the Temecula Valley Association of Restaurant and Wine Bars.\nIn just one city, there are such a variety of dining options \u2014 plus the fact that there seems to be no shortage of delicious food \u2014 makes it very confusing to decide what to try. In a few weeks, I will return to Temecula and plan to tackle a list of restaurants that I have had the opportunity to taste and write about \u2014 the kind of list that is hard to create but easy to follow along.\nI was given a really pleasant surprise when I visited the Community Center in downtown Temecula. For all my visits, I have always viewed the community center as the \u201cchurch,\u201d but as I pulled the car up in front of the building, to be greeted by friendly smiles and greeting cards made by the community groups that helped to organize the event, I realized how much of an integral part of the community this building is.\nOnce inside, I found a plethora of information available to visitors \u2014 plus a few great photo opportunities (and that\u2019s just inside the walls of the building... imagine what\u2019s in the halls on the backside of the building ). Check it out by clicking the link at the top right corner of this post to see more about the community center and events that are held there regularly.","token_len":761,"entropy":[8.8133,1.0,1.2858,10.2509,4.2592,2.2868,9.0337,3.525,1.8818,10.5663,1.9214,0.2817,0.6971,10.5302,2.9407,3.7348,1.9939,6.5156,0.8615,5.9402,6.1334,15.7166,1.5829,5.8962,3.1301,10.4728,3.2848,1.6604,8.061,0.9257,0.0004,6.5697,7.5441,0.0205,5.8254,1.7472,4.8498,2.0822,1.1576,0.0267,0.0309,0.8607,5.9465,4.229,3.5516,3.369,2.1187,2.3465,1.5024,3.2952,4.3885,7.5882,8.7914,1.454,0.8427,4.8163,4.9823,9.9169,0.0479,0.0023,1.089,4.3245,3.444,1.3154,4.82,0.0006,2.6266,0.974,6.4594,0.2448,3.6634,1.6691,6.9267,5.3971,0.6141,4.8707,8.178,0.4381,1.6148,0.7412,0.5627,15.3775,1.005,5.93,2.9729,1.6993,3.7386,4.1942,18.317,7.3422,5.6593,3.8158,2.2151,0.4421,3.5378,4.9844,4.7433,9.5946,0.0862,0.0316,5.3981,0.9673,3.8415,0.1388,5.0529,0.0026,4.4518,2.8687,6.9408,2.5666,2.0535,5.9734,1.5703,1.649,4.7064,0.0152,0.0022,5.3048,2.1815,2.175,4.9355,1.1435,4.8516,2.6859,6.3852,1.7041,6.0123,0.5036,0.6753,5.2786,3.1747,0.0729,10.1684,1.3686,0.0185,2.5699,3.797,3.992,0.0956,3.8049,6.6221,2.1351,1.4639,2.5929,3.9515,2.0504,0.4934,2.6499,6.443,3.4609,3.0405,1.2799,3.9498,6.4909,0.0455,1.3887,6.0542,4.4863,4.304,3.2864,8.5716,6.0844,5.841,6.244,8.3387,2.2928,6.6535,8.8255,5.1098,0.1925,1.0193,4.3366,0.3027,3.6056,0.0156,0.003,3.4662,4.5881,2.7027,0.1514,7.4398,3.0299,1.9565,2.6119,4.536,1.5039,0.6015,3.0029,7.9906,0.0717,0.0159,4.7822,1.5015,2.0232,2.0239,5.1685,4.7362,2.1129,1.0821,5.3056,2.9584,6.8278,1.0336,5.2115,1.7541,0.2373,0.6516,2.9449,2.0824,0.3308,5.4334,5.2544,3.1702,1.4968,4.429,2.3448,3.8839,0.8568,0.0009,0.0214,0.5711,3.9544,7.5915,1.5169,4.1418,0.3199,0.949,3.7295,0.8543,6.0101,0.6867,7.2956,0.6603,2.7879,0.0191,0.0058,1.786,1.524,0.72,3.5153,1.2842,6.8526,1.4588,5.3427,5.342,1.8834,0.0912,3.4877,3.1293,1.3988,2.4123,4.9969,4.5417,4.267,2.4063,1.4108,4.7464,2.9479,2.9363,6.5815,5.028,0.3478,2.8685,0.066,4.2446,2.4209,0.1845,6.0284,1.4073,6.978,0.5248,1.3889,8.7863,0.0353,1.1483,9.9162,1.1997,0.4944,1.7242,7.4868,2.9661,3.5822,1.4579,2.8918,1.6633,9.1528,3.7625,0.5798,0.6586,4.7405,1.2296,1.6069,3.9077,2.4675,6.1537,2.0829,0.6116,1.6453,3.3551,1.6352,3.7576,4.4321,0.4891,0.7346,2.0263,1.7694,5.1597,6.8009,9.6862,5.2516,1.6059,2.792,4.1663,1.7076,1.5589,7.9265,0.2724,5.5542,4.8153,0.1038,3.5545,3.6632,1.2876,6.4821,6.6033,1.586,5.4565,0.197,1.6924,5.4871,2.2294,4.233,4.383,1.3847,0.2423,2.8315,2.2266,0.7203,0.0055,2.4164,1.9207,4.0125,4.0576,1.2873,1.4143,3.6348,1.9604,0.1871,0.6627,3.2743,5.2212,6.1899,2.5293,3.6317,1.939,1.9322,2.6101,1.1187,1.8384,7.2703,6.4316,5.1661,2.8239,0.427,2.0248,0.7772,1.0752,4.5331,0.0539,0.0629,0.0062,2.3936,2.5555,3.7512,1.7374,3.7685,4.8983,2.4143,4.6287,4.4734,1.7594,6.8871,6.1104,0.1475,4.0064,1.4728,5.2172,10.9899,1.8424,0.5271,3.7815,1.759,6.0981,8.8201,0.2455,5.6728,4.4806,0.5358,0.2992,6.7495,0.0127,0.4531,1.5495,2.8425,8.5451,0.2788,0.0525,0.0028,0.0083,2.1671,4.1033,4.2689,0.4355,4.009,4.3293,1.1403,1.7506,2.8186,0.1111,0.0078,1.5648,3.6185,1.9069,3.143,3.0234,6.8274,0.9898,1.3776,3.4358,3.452,2.8736,6.6898,1.3503,6.5009,3.42,7.2947,0.5207,0.0452,0.4862,0.3129,0.6942,1.0601,1.3709,0.794,9.5104,0.3352,1.5146,5.461,0.2581,2.3857,0.0064,0.0099,2.9884,4.8457,1.5015,4.9274,0.6947,0.0574,0.4405,2.6742,0.0219,3.2581,6.2563,0.0071,1.5938,0.9352,0.7225,4.0786,0.4456,1.9206,3.5259,0.6656,2.6931,3.4863,0.9444,5.4042,1.2822,2.1577,0.0023,0.0085,0.7882,1.7697,2.7771,4.1577,0.1581,2.0094,1.041,5.8825,0.9974,2.1593,2.9429,4.0489,1.3775,1.2676,1.3742,0.0513,0.1826,4.1478,2.6661,1.391,3.1623,1.956,2.4837,5.001,0.6051,1.4821,3.098,6.7733,2.8199,3.4722,0.6949,1.6545,0.4832,7.2098,1.5366,3.6472,0.0721,5.255,0.8375,3.5834,6.7755,2.3534,2.2025,0.0435,2.1424,5.9143,0.0208,0.0194,2.7892,1.3332,0.0257,5.2965,1.4397,3.9695,9.3242,1.1169,2.8009,7.1686,1.3949,4.3404,1.8479,1.0185,4.4676,0.9092,3.9964,3.1874,3.4643,3.2219,0.3237,1.1641,1.2037,4.919,0.1878,1.6102,0.0025,0.0105,1.5611,4.7229,0.9726,7.485,2.0227,5.1849,0.076,2.3973,1.1267,1.0327,2.4924,4.3683,0.8537,3.4191,0.0153,4.973,2.22,5.3298,0.1466,4.7224,4.2612,4.9059,0.3914,4.6703,0.3125,2.756,4.2449,0.1462,6.7176,4.8778,4.279,0.0295,1.281,6.463,1.8285,0.4937,2.6472,3.8487,4.9758,1.0038,7.1444,5.5688,1.4438,2.1914,0.4408,2.8637,1.1056,5.6417,1.7422,3.213,4.3386,0.3413,0.0028,0.0103,1.3267,5.1522,4.1511,2.9676,3.6096,2.0394,0.6513,2.5626,2.6938,7.3579,0.7637,2.8562,1.0364,0.2486,2.5655,13.4168,1.2319,8.6404,4.1802,0.2312,0.7213,2.4968,3.7063,1.1164,6.7389,4.3971,3.3987,1.9489,3.9088,0.8011,0.0867,0.6038,2.1034,0.5683,5.9188,4.2727,3.3459,0.2354,7.645,5.9958,1.0082,5.3419,4.6066,6.7607,2.7472,1.4795,2.4239,6.5407,2.1582,4.068,2.7093,1.5421,0.9596,0.6407,0.2987,0.5445,1.6224,3.4038,1.2972,2.2427,1.6341,3.8408,0.0544,0.27,0.6556,0.7922,3.1569,2.4644,0.7197,0.3321,0.5513,5.6219,1.9885,0.4045,0.7584,2.4555,2.1146,7.0757,0.0012,4.6464,3.8297,2.3694,5.0464,3.5057,6.632,1.2919,2.5552,4.8358,5.3509,1.2053,4.4571,2.8601,5.426,3.3597,0.2096,1.1558,3.5546,7.6149,0.6074,5.2774,0.7483,0.1553,0.8791,7.039,8.9954,2.1735,5.8966,0.2044,0.1

As the songs","text":"The video begins with the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting opposite each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs play the two singers dance to tunes ranging from The Chainsmokers \u2018Holy Water\u2019 to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Folklore\u2019 \u2013 and are joined by the performers.\n\u201cYou know what they say? You put me in front of the camera and I\u2019m more photogenic than everyone else,\u201d says Rihanna in the video. \u201d I don\u2019t know what it is but you have to accept this fact about me,\u201d says singer Lenny Kravitz.\nThe video was filmed in Miami, New York, LA and Paris following an interview between the two stars last year. The singers were also featured in a recent campaign for Chanel\u2019s perfume Coco Mademoiselle and were one of the artists presenting awards at the 2020 Grammys.\n\u201cMusic is a very therapeutic and inspiring thing, and I think when people are looking for joy and happiness, they turn to something that gives them solace. And that\u2019s what a little song can do,\u201d says Lenny Kravitz about the track. \u201cSo when you watch this video, if you think of all the things you have gone through this year, maybe it puts a smile on your face. \u201d\nIn a news release for the track, which is currently streaming on Apple Music, the pair write \u201cThis song is meant for you \u2013 because for every bad thing, we made a promise to always remember the good. And so many good things happened this year \u2013 and still do. The time is now to be grateful with a smile.\u201d\nRihanna and Lenny Kravitz have collaborated before as part of the artist\u2019s fifth album \u2018Music of the Spheres\u2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song that was kind of written just as we were getting ready on the track,\u201d says Rihanna. \u201cIt just felt like that track is a little bit all of us, for everything that we went through, for our experiences, and for making music together, and that it was kind of this whole thing that happened and it\u2019s not something that we were waiting to do. \u201d.\nThe track follows several singles earlier this year between the artist and the British singer, who were also featured on the tracks \u2018Savage\u2019 and \u2018Worth It\u2019.\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday, February 7th, 2017 at 23:37 and is filed under.

Usually taking the form of a melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons that they themselves had or were willing to wear during the battles. In many cases, tournaments were intended to provide a way for the winners to accumulate wealth or land. As military conflict, as opposed to civilian competition, was the chief purpose of tournament activities, it is unsurprising that there is considerable disagreement amongst writers on the purpose of the contests. However, by the end of the 12th century it became clear that the rules of tournament should be applied to civilian activities such as hunting, archery, and other sports. Tournaments and courtship of the nobleman in the 12th century, were a very popular public entertainment, in order to establish and maintain order on a social level. By the late 13th-centur y the courtship contests gave way to military engagements and the most famous, the tournament of the Golden Spurs, took place in 1305. In 1415 the French King Charles VII organised a tournament, in which he received the golden spurs from the victorious knight, as a reward for defeating the Italian King.\nThe word \"tournament\" arose in the 12th century from the Latin tournus meaning \"round\". The practice came from Europe, particularly France where tournaments were one of the most popular forms of entertainment. These were the same competitions that existed among the ancient Romans as a way to find a husband for the princesses.\nThere were many different types of tournaments. In the early days of the game tournaments were mostly of the hunting competition type, that ended when a victorious hunter brought a game over the border of an opposing camp. When England gained its independence, tournaments were usually of the courting type, which became a very popular form of entertainment. These tournaments usually consisted of dancing, singing and wrestling, and there was some competition among the participants. Although tournaments were a popular pastime the British generally accepted them much less enthusiastically than the Scots.\nA tournament could have a number of competitors, and it was also possible to enter more than one contestants. Usually the winners in each contest were awarded their prize, with the winning contestants being crowned at the end. These ceremonies were extremely popular, and they were also a way to show off the victorious knight\u2019s skills and qualities. As the game spread across Europe the rules changed, but the principle of each contest was the same. The object of the game was for an individual to gain the victory over a number of competitors.\nThe earliest known tournament in England was held in 1050 AD, and it was a battle against three other individual competitors using wooden horses, and weapons that were in the hands of a professional horseman. However, from the late 12th century the tournaments started to take on a military form. These tournaments started to attract more and more people, and the number of people that participated in them increased. By the end of the 13th century many of the tournaments took the form of a series of games and contests, where two or more competitors faced each other. The winner in each game was awarded their prize. The purpose of the games was to teach the principles of the game as well as it being a way for the winners to increase their social standing.\nBy the end of the 14th and 15th centuries the tournaments in England were a very popular way of showing off their skills and qualities. These tournaments were mainly a way of gaining prestige, but it also was a way for the participants to make money, and build their social reputation.

He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script. Sinha felt the story belonged to a Bollywood film rather than India so as to be able to draw on international experience.\nAccording to Sinha, the cast of the film features a mixture of actors from Indian and Pakistan. \"I feel India and Pakistan will have to work together to handle the situation in the film, \" he said. \"It's not fair to play this issue like politics, it's a very emotional story. This is the only way I can handle it. \"\nMohnish Bahl (Sonu Sood) is a British-Indian born youngster who works as a hacker and a computer technician. He's also a social activist and his brother is in prison for terrorism offenses. He has an American Dream in which they all live in Australia.\nThe film is being produced in association with Farzinda Enterprises. It stars Farzin Akhtar (Mohnish's brother). The film is scheduled to get a worldwide theatrical premiere.\nThe project has been in the works since two years. The film has received backing from the United States Presidents Commission on Foreign Relations. Also part of the production is Farzinda Entertainment which, according to Sinha, belongs to a group of Pakistani business owners who are trying to promote films set in Pakistan's political and cultural history as well as the Indian military history.\nThe film is scheduled to be shot near Karachi and Lahore and Sinha has visited both locations and has met with political leaders from the two neighboring countries. According to Director Sinha, he expects to have the film completed by the first half of next year.\nIn one scene, the film has a scene which shows a young boy holding a gun. It was shot by the director himself.\nThe original version of the film was released in India in 2006 and received mixed reviews. The film was based on the book, \"Cry, Baby, Cry\" by Jodi Picoult. It was produced by Raj Kapoor, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan for their respective company in association with director Homi Adaji-Kapoor.\nAt the screening of the film, Shah Rukh Khan and Anu Shankar were quoted as saying that they wished that the story of their country had been given a more romanticized portrayal. Sinha's version of the film is the first film based on the book to be made in India.\nThe film takes place in India during 1999. In one scene, Shah Rukh plays the role of a middle school teacher with a wife that he has just lost. His character is seen trying to save a dying girl. The film focuses on what happens when he has to marry his teacher's sister for a sum of money.\nThe first cast listed shows Shah Rukh, Kareena Kapoor, Jackie Shroff and Preity Zinta. However, Shah Rukhas decided to opt out of the film saying that he would only be in films that he is convinced on. Kareena Kapoor then replaced him.\nDuring the final year of her studies at the London School of Economics and Political Science, Rina Khatnekar, daughter of famous actress Rina Daggubati (who made in films such as Raat, Choti, Ishq, etc) got the offer to play the lead actress in the film.

The Ottoman fleet , commanded by Hobart Pasha","text":"The ship saw action during the Russo @ - @ Turkish War of 1877 \u2013 88. She spent the war in the Black Sea squadron. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was badly defeated on 9-9-1878. The squadron consisted of the steam frigate Aurora, the gun corvette Sagitta, the steam frigate Aurora, the gun frigate and frigate Orion, the steam frigate Arcturus and the gun frigate and torpedo boat Phoenix. On the 24 August 1878, the frigate Aurora, under the command of Rear Admiral Michael F. B. Girdlestone, was in convoy to the Mediterranean, when Hobart Pasha\u2019s fleet, consisting of eleven vessels and 4,000 men, sailed from Tiflis to attack the British frigate. Aurora made the mistake of moving her guns forward to open fire on a sloop. The Aurora struck and was badly damaged, sinking and blowing up after the guns were removed. On repairs in Portsmouth in 1879, the Aurora was sold from the Admiralty to Mr. Henry H. A. Doran from Glasgow for \u00a33,000. On 12 November 1879, the Aurora was transferred under the ownership of the British Empire Tobacco Co. in London.\nAfter the end of the war, the Aurora was sold on 4 April 1879 to the Egyptian General Trading Company on the condition that the hull of the ship be broken up and the material used to build a cement block factory.\nShe was scuttled in the Red Sea and turned into a quarry on 13 September 1879. Her crew were transferred from the battleship Albion to the steam schooner Athenian for use in the quarry. The Aurora had a registered tonnage of 1,450 tons.\nAfter sinking and quarrying, the Aurora\u2019s hull was broken apart in 1882 before the vessel was salvaged and crushed. She could not be scrapped as she had been built to the highest standards and the materials from the hull were used by the British for the construction of the block making factory near Sheerness.\nHer hull was salvaged and sent to South Kensington as part of the exhibits at the British Empire Exhibition of 1925. Her remains were demolished after the exhibition of 1931.\nA photo taken on the Aurora when she was still in service and was in possession of the Admiralty (source; Historic England)\nWe need to think and plan as a team for the future. Our community\u2019s health, safety and economic vitality are dependent on the way we invest in our schools.\nWe need to recognize that our local districts aren\u2019t independent of us as parent; they must be protected and supported\nWe have to think long-term, and be willing to support ourselves because that will also enable our young people to benefit and grow\nParents need to be comfortable in the fact that there is some variation in district spending based on the funding model and the financial health of the district and its parent body.\nI wish that the community would recognize we have a shared responsibility. Our young people are our future. We have an obligation to provide a high-quality education for all our students.\nI support more funding in the schools and to make sure that all the kids in the area have a good education, regardless

{"prompt":"Medical professionals characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness , farsightedness , astigmatism , and < unk > ( the age @ - @ related blurring of near @ - @ point vision ) as consequences","text":"Medical professionals characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and < unk > ( the age @ - @ related blurring of near @ - @ point vision ) as consequences of the physical process that makes it possible for light to hit a certain organ in the human eyes called the retina. While that organ is responsible for detecting light rays, its role is significantly different from that of the photoreceptors and their neurotransmitters in the outer layer of the retina.\nAccording to information released today on the Internet by the Eye Health Institute in Germany, the retina is essentially sensitive only to specific wavelengths of light ; the retina does not have the capacity to analyze a whole spectrum of light colors. However, due to the fact that colors appear to be different, it is usually not possible for any natural form of sight to differentiate between a bluish and a greenish color ( although such colors can often be recognized as white and black on a digital monitor ) : it requires the function of the brain to make the correct distinction.\nWhat really sets the retina apart from other organs is that its sensitivity does not depend on wavelength. That is, the same color can appear in different colors, or in a different position or different brightness ( the sensitivity of the photoreceptors in the outer layer of the retina also increases with the increasing amount of light that falls on them, just as happens with the sensitivity of other organs in nature ).\nTherefore, it is necessary to perform visual stimulation when looking at a computer screen to obtain the effects that make the digital world so attractive and useful to us. For example, if a person is visually stimulated in the course of performing one simple or repetitive task - reading, for example - they may have a much more difficult time concentrating on something else or having more success in other areas of their daily life.\nThat also explains why certain activities and professions that involve computer use often correlate with low levels of overall health ( and also the appearance of various eye problems ).\nWhile the health benefits of digital technology may be greater than ever, digital technology does not, on its own, completely guarantee that our natural, organic sight will stay intact.\nUnfortunately, vision problems are more prevalent in digital workers who have regular computer work from home ( see also my previous post about a New York-based computer programmer who became blind after years of computer work ).\nOn the other hand, there is an increasing number of cases where people use glasses or contact lenses in order to improve their eye health and make work from home less difficult to perform under some circumstances. Many of these people are already seeing problems after working at home for a short period of time, which in many cases is also caused by the increased physical activity necessary to perform the job at hand.\nIn my opinion, the proper use of both glasses and contact lenses requires the appropriate training, experience with their use, and certain equipment in order to ensure that the wearer has proper sight.\nIt would be good to emphasize that if the wearer is interested in using a particular lens, they should see their optometrist to clarify what type, or types, of lens ( depending on the desired outcomes ), or what type of technology, they are interested in using ( see http:\/\/edv.yorku.ca \/ index.asp?pid=3033 ).\nIn the case of digital workers, it may be necessary to combine more

Bishop Andreas allowed for the","text":"Large cathedrals such as Elgin had many chapel altars and daily services and required to be suitably staffed with canons assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars. Bishop Andreas allowed for the existence of at least one or two priests to reside in the convent and assist with duties both spiritual and secular.\nThe Bishop of Mentz, Andreas Schmelzer, in late 1177 (aged 71) received a letter from King Frederick I of Sicily who wrote the King of the Romans and his vassals to assist the Pope with an endowment and permission to build a monastery. The building was to bear the name of St. Francis and as long as the bishops of Mentz remained unmarried and the congregation was not to be transferred elsewhere, the friars were not to seek to obtain revenues either from Germany or from Rome, but to seek donations of the people of Mentz.\nAt this point the Franciscans had been established not for more than a little while, so no monastic records exist and the number of houses and priests is uncertain. We know that they had a large number of schools and chapels.\nThe Franciscans came to Westphalia in 1170 and by 1219, according to their own account, the Order had two convents with about seventy-five brothers and the friars were to assist the canons and chaplains in their duties.\nLater in 1224, at the request of Bishop Andreas, there was a petition from the nobles to the Diet of Ratisbon that the friars should be received by him and allow them to reside in the city. However, the friars received no formal permission to move to Ratisbon until 1228 (the friars then obtained a special exemption from taxes due to the Church) and were incorporated into the Church of Ratisbon only by 1282.\nIn order to facilitate this incorporation, the friars were instructed by Bishop Peter to move to Ratisbon and they obeyed. Thus the city was not abandoned by the friars. But not all were welcomed by Bishop Peter. In a letter which he addressed, written in 1283, to Bishop Heinrich (Ratisbon) a question was asked by the latter as to what is to happen if the friars do not wish to accept provisions which include the submission of church property to the Bishops of Mentz. The friars of Ratisbon were then ordered to remain at Mentz where they still remained in 1286. (Note 1)\nAnother letter, dated in 1290, was written asking the Bishop of Mentz for permission to appoint a dean (or vicar). The friars gave such an answer, even with permission from the bishops, to avoid this.\nThus the friars did not only have to contend with religious conflicts. The political conflict between the Emperor and the Pope also had repercussions for the Friars Minor in Westphalia. A new treaty was concluded between Frederick III and Pope Gregory VIII in 1282. In order to put the Treaty into force, the Pope had to appoint a bishop whose jurisdiction would include the lands of the Imperial family. The Pope accordingly appointed Bishop Peter of Ratisbon, who was to preside over that bishopric during his lifetime and to succeed him as bishop if he died in office.\nSo, on the one hand in order to comply with the conditions of the Treaty, the Pope appointed Bishop Peter Bishop of Ratisbon, but on the other hand the Order of Friars Minor received no land, but was deprived of the right to receive revenues and exemption from taxes from the Emperor.\nSince no church registers exist for the friars in Westphalia we cannot tell what was the final fate of the Order of Friars Minor in Westphalia.","token_len":769,"entropy":[9.6391,4.9991,0.0488,5.921,0.0024,6.7487,4.3911,6.8492,4.2428,8.5247,4.7523,0.0092,1.9708,9.3611,2.9386,4.1412,7.2915,5.3684,1.2195,9.6512,0.0046,5.8192,3.1917,9.1738,2.1489,10.9797,0.2581,1.8523,10.3765,1.5961,0.0044,4.8352,0.1509,0.0001,2.3228,7.6617,0.1991,0.3556,8.1168,9.7976,10.7472,2.5748,1.5314,5.636,0.0342,5.5486,0.0195,1.7235,4.701,0.2455,5.4661,3.1069,6.3387,0.7483,0.8505,5.4165,2.2901,7.5018,2.067,6.7392,6.3575,4.0437,0.0235,4.3189,0.3416,1.7299,5.4343,4.3164,0.7562,9.8195,3.9617,1.9891,6.6248,5.3451,5.8144,1.2579,0.4421,4.5163,7.3476,4.1236,5.346,4.4894,7.179,4.5237,1.0808,4.9263,1.3417,2.8778,0.3806,5.1363,4.3851,3.0073,2.195,12.0062,4.5077,4.0679,3.8773,7.2439,3.0356,3.1538,2.9498,3.5094,2.6748,8.0949,1.154,0.1219,2.7451,6.0619,2.0716,3.2015,1.9924,4.7097,5.3232,0.4733,2.9399,7.7397,0.2925,2.5685,0.8297,1.9441,2.163,1.308,5.298,0.8928,2.1605,7.1227,0.6227,0.8238,0.2777,2.2627,0.4099,3.3687,3.8223,5.2057,6.3885,0.0424,1.1341,7.0955,2.2154,1.1539,0.0031,1.916,7.1569,2.4724,3.3907,6.2112,1.4014,1.5386,3.8706,0.9216,6.0561,6.7187,0.5399,0.8236,6.8239,0.1586,2.2622,3.1616,0.8032,7.0104,3.7891,4.1545,9.0903,6.7228,1.2257,7.2639,0.1671,1.5144,3.7238,2.7536,1.7541,1.2574,4.3874,7.3786,2.2134,2.9994,7.0473,2.1175,0.3835,0.0038,1.1898,1.5073,4.4976,2.0865,2.2875,1.2882,5.9766,0.0194,0.9438,2.5821,2.8928,4.5473,6.83,3.4688,7.334,0.0599,0.988,6.327,1.4798,1.443,4.9909,5.5081,5.3746,0.5612,7.832,2.5971,4.0663,1.7079,5.6645,0.3357,6.385,2.5192,6.2674,2.9701,3.5016,0.313,5.681,1.616,0.7067,4.675,2.2906,2.0302,3.0387,0.833,0.0354,7.5822,1.1499,6.3946,0.0013,2.7497,2.2756,1.3272,3.7586,0.0054,0.1392,5.1573,0.7548,8.0077,2.0567,0.009,1.4018,1.0587,3.7099,1.2455,5.0619,2.4009,4.8119,4.2727,5.8762,0.0011,3.5223,2.8671,2.577,0.7617,2.8381,6.2388,2.1717,5.9821,7.0883,0.0033,3.6291,4.0441,5.4825,1.8892,0.8986,7.2952,0.9122,5.0732,5.1996,0.0136,1.6172,2.1994,5.8734,1.2636,10.8328,0.0035,2.3001,4.4657,0.0196,0.0006,1.303,2.2006,3.2458,0.7608,1.7847,5.9299,1.6042,2.6302,4.1837,0.7111,3.7508,0.8805,1.1938,0.0021,3.5304,4.1122,1.6307,5.5833,0.496,0.6823,4.9563,2.0539,1.1723,8.2473,2.0528,1.2449,8.0812,1.1016,7.1161,5.5732,9.0496,2.7755,1.2588,3.6523,0.0049,0.5724,0.5608,7.5322,2.1789,6.1755,1.99,6.7187,1.5624,0.1979,2.7771,0.7736,0.7592,5.2034,0.8492,4.166,0.1715,1.331,3.8791,0.0067,5.3826,0.3156,5.3492,3.1543,1.8245,3.0884,2.0987,5.7317,0.0013,0.0008,3.2587,1.8586,2.7338,3.9453,2.4471,5.8653,0.0208,4.7107,7.7414,1.7674,4.6539,3.3497,0.4669,4.0909,3.5329,0.4403,0.962,5.8589,3.8595,0.4597,3.3324,7.4198,1.9282,0.397,3.8239,0.7163,3.3223,0.0073,0.0025,3.9892,3.0775,3.0549,5.4518,0.4524,0.7563,2.2952,4.5082,0.0912,4.1789,2.7286,6.971,0.7267,0.7863,2.4043,0.0051,1.676,4.6385,1.939,2.7648,4.4338,1.5977,4.8241,0.9049,3.0825,0.0015,0.002,1.6463,4.0561,8.6488,0.0317,1.0202,5.3598,1.6728,6.2887,1.3858,4.5219,5.798,3.1387,0.4196,1.4143,0.0038,2.2406,4.9299,5.2202,2.0245,3.2671,3.9525,1.6708,3.9007,1.8597,1.2125,2.1809,4.1669,0.628,5.7758,2.6991,4.6586,5.5796,6.4554,1.013,1.8772,3.5387,0.4383,4.3809,1.9538,7.7195,0.2465,5.7582,10.3587,0.0149,0.0121,2.3772,4.8744,6.2003,0.8237,1.1075,3.5113,1.1708,6.4274,3.8388,0.0208,2.8069,4.629,2.3402,3.5435,1.5716,0.5844,1.4286,0.0027,4.7373,0.1575,6.2604,0.0924,5.2568,9.2708,3.5946,5.9903,1.5199,8.1923,0.2055,6.6685,2.5441,0.9837,0.3613,7.3387,0.0563,0.9808,0.8608,0.0034,0.8454,1.7193,4.1918,0.0088,5.5324,1.5306,0.0015,0.001,1.8629,4.4096,3.6688,0.1858,4.8573,2.4952,1.9577,0.0059,5.1466,0.3134,5.9374,2.9758,2.6028,4.619,5.0983,0.8398,5.5559,3.8142,4.958,0.6631,0.4417,6.2421,2.2421,3.2489,0.9042,4.5732,0.3048,2.542,0.4751,2.8165,2.2213,7.1135,1.1578,1.0191,0.5824,0.4724,0.0031,2.6219,1.2706,0.0817,5.8904,0.8864,7.3863,4.7396,3.3997,3.8523,0.0381,4.1096,1.4212,4.2169,0.0095,5.7143,4.0508,2.2528,2.0449,2.469,6.0141,5.5634,4.2366,0.5409,0.6467,4.6482,0.5698,5.1417,6.1837,5.828,4.2914,1.5193,5.3932,1.2837,2.7528,0.0061,4.3245,0.1825,4.3584,2.9943,1.3017,6.4897,0.1559,6.4934,4.0217,3.3505,2.3601,7.5872,4.4363,2.0018,0.415,6.1182,1.5386,0.5205,1.9857,4.2807,2.8378,5.132,1.6708,0.4504,5.5246,0.0182,12.678,2.3778,3.5369,0.0284,0.0032,0.594,4.4954,4.6989,7.1927,0.9445,5.4862,1.17,7.8188,2.7699,0.4928,3.1667,2.8054,3.5921,1.2023,0.5117,3.781,2.0989,2.9527,3.4877,0.0732,5.8797,1.8999,7.5501,1.1376,2.3744,0.5278,0.7398,1.6534,2.3725,0.3286,3.4166,0.8422,2.0843,5.4637,4.863,2.2246,3.2664,0.9894,5.7669,1.1201,0.8398,7.8295,4.3106,1.0282,1.6786,1.8191,7.1049,1.9974,1.988,2.2627,2.4282,3.9058,0.0027,0.002,2.127,1.5849,1.3025,2.1273,3.8308,0.0018,0.1628,5.5573,4.7931,5.6879,5.973,2.1524,2.5134,2.7067,2.5393,6.0841,0.7747,1.6389,2.0673,5.3302,1.1015,1.2158,1.4189,5.3855,0.5317,1.0623,5.0942,2.1562,4.3507,1.4988,2.6132,0.0193,6.5772,4.1928,0.0845,6.0414,0.0218,0.43,5.2321,0.9765,0.3386,0.7186,0.7119,0.3853,1.3898,2.3603,0.922,0.1642,6.2422,0.2769,2.8291,0.0009,0.0018,1.8135,2.3079,0.9609,0.0054,0.0041,0.1986,2.0976,6.2474,2.0298,6.0565,0.0137,1.441,5.0063,1.3793,8.2239,3.1172

In creating the Georgian Unicode block, important roles were played by the efforts of Georgian philologists and designers at the World Institute for Cultural Heritage, as well as the Association of Georgian Languages and Literatures, both based in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nThe Georgian Unicode block is the third official block in the Unicode Standard to contain Georgian script.\nIntroduction ; Geo- and demographic information by region is used in order to assist you in selecting the correct font to be installed on your computer and to ensure compatibility between software applications. The following information is included: Name, Abbreviation, Country, Region and Language.\nThe Greek capital of Greece, situated between the Aegean Sea and the Mountain Range. It serves as the political, economic, cultural and industrial center of all the country. Newspapers that are published in Greece usually have many pages and feature long articles about current events plus several columns of advertisements. In order to read the newspaper on a computer, people use the Times program or TimesViewer. The Times program is a very popular computer application.\nIt may seem a little late to me to start talking about the end of the year and the beginning of another; but I\u2019m not the one to hold back when I feel like writing.\nIt all began a few weeks ago\u2026 the time came to say good-bye to my oldest two boys. They went to university and now a few miles, to a state where the weather is much different but where I will always have you in my hearts.\nWe were in a small town and had a wonderful drive to get to your college campus. You left a bag, stuffed with all the things I thought my girls needed to start life; and also included a note saying just to come and see them whenever you felt like. I drove to the campus and the next thing I knew\u2026 I was alone, and for much of the day too. I knew that you had gone out, but in the middle of that parking lot, I couldn\u2019t remember where you took off to.\nThe morning of the next day came, and I set out to find you. I drove into town, saw the park I was hoping you would be in, turned around, and drove the opposite direction. On the way back, I turned the radio off so I could not be distracted by music. I listened to it on the radio, and a voice I never heard before came out. It wasn\u2019t my parents voice\u2026 but something that was familiar, yet distant to me!\nI made the decision not to turn, to take the drive back, and to be with my girls. The next drive I took was a 10 minute call home. I wasn\u2019t upset, but just wanted to make sure you were ok and ready to come home. I have not heard from you since then\u2026 and I am not sure where you are or how you are doing.\nIn all these years of making this journey to get through life\u2019s challenges, I have never had a friend like you. I will always think of you\u2026 knowing that you will take care of my girls when I am gone. You are my strength when I don\u2019t know how far I can carry myself, but because you left me with only words, I have your heart forever.\nWe all want the perfect vacation. From the ocean to the mountains, from camping to an exotic hotel under the skies, we go to places and we want to remember our experience.

A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when the Club of Picardy Spaniel merged with the < unk > Picard Club. Further additions to the Club occurred in 2000 when the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel merged with the Club of Picardy Spaniel and from 2006 when the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel was officially adopted as the Club of Picardy Spaniel. These mergers occurred at a period of great political upheaval in France; the Club was renamed the Club of Picardy Spaniel in 2006 and became the official breed club of the French federation in 2008. It is also affiliated with the American Kennel Club.\nThe breed standard of the Club of Picardy Spaniel was adopted in 1968. The breed's first champion was named Paul de Sacy who won the show at the 1972 Paris Regional Show. The official colours are light grey, chestnut and tan with tan markings sometimes present on the face. The breed was shown at the 1976 Paris International Show but was not formally recognised as a breed at that show.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nMost dogs of the breed weigh between 12 and 18\u00a0kg and average around 16\u00a0kg. They have a compact structure with the long body giving the impression of a large size. The body is compact with a strong, muscular look. The head is broad and square with ears set low and carried erect. The skull is not protruding as in the American Shorthair which is sometimes used as a breed of choice. The eyes are black or hazel and not red. The tail is carried in a high, slightly curved position and not carried low as in the American Shorthair. The shoulder blades are well angulated. The underside of the legs should be clean with no white patches and there should be no un-groomed skin.\nThe Club of Picardy Spaniel has a low and narrowly formed muzzle and smooth, slightly rounded corners of the mouth. The teeth are small, and the tongue should be free and dry. The paw is muscular and strong and of a moderate length. The fur is coarse and short, with plenty of undercoat, and it should be straight and not curled. The guard hair and top coats are shorter in number compared to the length of the coat. The coat varies between a very short, wiry coat with straight hair in the chest and face to a shaggy coat. Both these coats are acceptable. The colouring of the coat is brown to black but tan is acceptable with black markings in the chest and face being particularly desirable.\nThe breed is not a strong swimmer and is suited to being part of a family but is an excellent companion dog. This breed likes people and has a strong desire to please. These dogs are generally docile and friendly.\nThe Club of Picardy Spaniel should have a good work ethic and is often good in herding. The breed is easily trained and easily trained in obedience and agility competitions. As in most breeds, the best way of training is with positive reinforcement to get this breed to be obedient. However, the breed is not very sensitive to the owner's mood and may not listen to the owner as much as some other breeds. For this reason it is good to be a consistent and firm leader when training them. This may be better done by giving them an item of food they desire or a toy to entertain them.\nThe breed is known for being quick at jumping and for being a good retriever dog although it is somewhat less effective in retrieving than other breeds of retrievers. They are also very good for work on water and in fishing boats.\nMost of the dogs of this breed suffer from separation

Album Reviews. AllMusicReviews: \"Rap God Lil G had a major 2017 with the arrival of Blowout (a collaborative effort with 50 Cent), a slew of unstoppable singles, as well as his latest LP.\nThe album is in the same vein as most mixtapes since it is a sampling of a more varied sample of rappers and rhyme schemes.\nLike all mixtapes, the listener is expected to be very comfortable with rapping in an effort to understand certain lines. The songs are often a mix of old and new material with some of the older styles being re-explored. This makes it a good place to showcase some material that has been in the background for a while but has not seen the light of day.\nI would highly recommend for a wide range of audience and this album is just too cool to not be on your playlist. From Hip Hop Songs By Lil G G-Unit KAYTRANADA. Lil Wayne: Wacka Chillin.\nAll of these songs are great, but I have been really getting into Lil G s beats lately which are good. This album would be one of my top 3 of every year, not only because of the music, but he gets it right a lot of the time. I think I have even heard it a few times in one year.\nIt s a great mixtape and has just started to snowball in terms of being a classic. All of these sound cool at the time.\nAnd the last one s cool. All Hip Hop Albums. All Rap Albums. Lil G Albums. G-Unit Albums. KAYTRANADA Albums. KAYTRANADA Albums. Lil Wayne Albums. G-Unit Albums.

James told Sunrise that viewers could expect more backstory from Becca.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a whole lot of drama to come, \u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope you guys are patient, too, because there are some things we have to get behind the scenes and things we have to make sure we got ready for, so yeah, it might take a little longer than we think but I\u2019m looking forward to the show. \u201d\nAfter the announcement of Season 10 at SXSW, the cast of The Fosters was asked if they thought Nicole was \u201cstill in love with Josh.\u201d\nFosters star Ashley Benson ( Nicole ) answered \u201cThat\u2019s just speculation.\u201d \u201cAnd it sounds like a question to me, but, unfortunately, it\u2019s just, \u201cIt\u2019s not a thing that I think about.\u201d\nAs Benson\u2019s time in The Fosters came to an end, she has moved on with her life. While Alec and Becca became engaged, Nicole moved on to pursue a career as a model. Her modeling success helped her realize a childhood dream to become a professional basketball player. She has since signed with the Chicago Bears\u2019 organization.\nNicole is currently dating former Chicago Bears kicker Jason Taylor. Following the announcement of their engagement, James spoke to Access Hollywood in July, telling the outlet that the couple is \u201cmadly in love.\u201d\nWhile she was set to attend the World Cup tournament in South Africa with her fianc\u00e9, he suffered a foot injury that delayed the couple\u2019s trip to South Africa.\nNicole had another successful career year, appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. However, she declined to return as an Fosters cast member.\nI have a very simple script to test if everything is good with my server and its up to date. Everything works fine on my local server though, it does not work on my Apache server hosted at home.\nI added in the.htaccess file in site root directory and also on document root the following code, not sure if that is all I need to do.\nBut even though my index.php works fine I now get the following in my apache error log and the site stops working completely:\nCan someone please help me find out what the problem is? I am not sure if my Apache is using the php files on \/public instead of the one in \/index.php or if it cannot find them.\nThe issue is not your.htaccess file. I think that is ok. It is the Apache server in your home environment that should work. If that server does not work - then something is wrong with your hosting package that you may not be aware of.\nThe error is telling you that the file cannot be found, which means that Apache is no longer able to see that the specified script was able to load it successfully. This may either be because PHP is not installed on that server (which would not cause any problems locally) or that Apache has been configured to not support that file. (This could happen if you did not disable PHP within the PHP.ini, or if you deleted the folder containing that file, or if you accidentally created an unindexed folder containing that file.)\nWe are in the process of reviewing your information.

His father, John Butler Yeats ( 1839 \u2013 1922 ), was a prominent Dublin poet, as well as an associate of Oscar Wilde. Yeats married Constance Anne Mary Fitzgerald ( 1854 - 1918 ), her family descended from the 18th-century Fitzgerald of Wicklow and is descended in their genealogy from Edmund Fitzgerald ( 1671 \u2013 1751 ), a diplomat who served as High Commissioner to the Court of St. James in London. Their son, Ian Yeats Fitzgerald ( 1922 - ) was born in London and is a notable English author. William Butler Yeats was a poet, dramatist, artist, and translator. In 1886 he emigrated to America but returned to Ireland in 1892 as a result of a scandal related to an anti-German propaganda film he wrote, produced, and directed, titled The Story of Sigurd the Vengeful. In 1919 Yeats wrote and directed a propaganda film for Ireland, which was viewed by the Irish government as subversive. Yeats served as a professor at Princeton University from 1937-1953. His main body of work was published after his death in 1955. His most famous works in English include : \" The Road Not Taken \" ( 1923 ) ; \" The Rape of the Lock, or'The Rape'( 1923 \u2013 1954 ) ; \" In Search of the Lost City of Coleridge \" ( 1933 ) ; \" The Man Who Was Not There \" ( 1937 ) ; \" Preludios and Interludes, \" a series of 13 poems on classical music for solo voice and piano, first published in 1936 ; \" The Poetry of the Dead ( 1954 ) ; and the \" Poems of the Afternoon Hours \" ( 1956 ). Yeats was awarded, in 1930, a British Empire Achievement Award for his lifetime of service to the nation and was a recipient of numerous honourary degrees and awards. Yeats is recognized as one of the great Irish poets of the 20th century and is an international symbol of Irish cultural identity.

I am getting a little worried about whether my visa is working properly and whether I have missed certain things. I will return to the United States in January and then return to San Diego in March or April. I will then return to Washington in May and work until September. Next I will do an Irish field trip and in October I will return to the United States and then, finally, return to Ireland. However, although many people are already on their way to Ireland, I am not sure whether to have my passport stamped in Dublin before or after I get to Ireland. After my field trips, I intend to do some work on my articles, prepare a graduate school applications, and spend some time travelling with my wife. The dates I plan to return are : December 30 \u2013 January 5, 2001 ; January 6 \u2013 14, 2001 ; and January 15 \u2013 28, 2001. My wife has been eagerly awaiting my arrival for six months. She is looking forward to taking our two children, Nora and Ryan, and me to Dublin and then to many other places in Ireland. She wishes to visit the Clogher and Burren National Parks, as well as the Ring of Kerry ; we are not sure where to stay. We want to visit Donegal, Cork, Galway, Connemara, and Clifden.

The cover and album of the single included a version of \"A Taste of Honey\" written by Orlando and the band. Neil Tennant sang the lead vocals in the song ; Tennant had originally intended to do the song with Orlando's voice ; however Orlando had been told to be careful with vocals. During the next months the band was recording their debut album and touring in support. Tennant was not happy with the arrangement of the song ; he wanted to include parts sung by him. Tennant took a recording of the song, played his parts on a synthesizer, then played the parts with the band on an acoustic guitar.

The first reported European sighting of Lord Howe","text":"It appears that, prior to European discovery and settlement, Lord Howe Island was uninhabited, and unknown to Polynesian peoples of the South Pacific. The first reported European sighting of Lord Howe Island was by Lieutenant Cadell on the 22nd June 1787 in the Hon. Richard Parker. It was first claimed by George Vancouver on 27 January 1819. Lord Howe Island and its northern vicinity were claimed in 1821 by Lord Melbourne's first Governor of the South Seas, Robert Hunter. Lord Howe Island was finally made an integral Crown Estate on 23 March 1838 when it was included in the South Seas Island Commission.\nThe first known permanent non-indigenous population was recorded in the 19th century, when Polynesians arrived en masse and subsequently established a settlement on Norfolk Island. The first permanent European settlement on the island was established in 1841 by Australian and New Zealand military volunteers from The United Service Institution, who stayed on the island from April 1841 to January 1842, as part of the South Seas Expeditions. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's Royal Navy Expedition to the South Pacific in the s, which surveyed the Southern Ocean and included Lord Howe Island, did not make landfall there due to poor winds.\nIn the 1860s, there were about 40 settlers on the island. The government of Australia acquired the island from the King in 1886 as part of an effort to open up Australia's southern seas to settlement. Lord Howe Island was the property of the New South Wales government between 1886 and 1946. In the late 1930s and 1940s, the island was used as a major training centre for German U-boat crews sent to join the U-boat forces of the Nazi Germany Navy. The island also hosted a large concentration camp during World War II. During World War II, some of the island's native inhabitants were evacuated and relocated to other areas of New South Wales and Tasmania. In 1949, a small group of German citizens and their family members moved to the island along with a local Polynesian group. From 1951 to 1968, the island was used for experiments with the release of rats into uninhabited island habitats.\nA number of scientific teams have visited Lord Howe Island since the 1920s, including surveys to investigate the distribution of Australian wildlife, for example, and plant pathological investigations. In 1957, members of the Imperial College, London took part in efforts to find a suitable Antarctic alternative for the world's first nuclear waste repository. One of the scientists who made his way to Antarctica on the ship HMS Challenger, Charles Darwin, died at the age of 49 of a brain tumour while on a visit to Lord Howe Island in 1831.\nIn 1961, Professor Douglas L. Clements, the chief botanist with the Australian Museum (now the Australian Museum in Sydney) began a study of the flora of the island and its surrounding area. In 1967, an expedition set out to survey the topography and landforms on Lord Howe Island.\nIn 1969, the island's geology and its volcanic history was assessed by the University of Cambridge and the University of Adelaide. Between 1973 and 1985, the Geological Survey of New South Wales studied the geology of the island, with a particular emphasis on the volcanology and sedimentary geology of the central part of the island. In 1992, the International Geodesy Year was held on the island in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the World Geodetic System 1984, and included activities on the geodynamic evolution of the Pacific region. In 1995, scientists from the Australian Museum and other organisations led a six-month expedition to the island to study the plant life and the oceanographies of the island and its adjacent waters. On the island, it collected samples of rocks and soil and also mapped the topography and sediment cover, using magnetic and optical sensors.","token_len":773,"entropy":[7.6437,0.8889,4.2905,6.205,0.0039,9.0914,8.9534,3.3161,3.9828,0.7104,10.4846,4.6235,8.1297,0.84,5.6851,0.0006,0.3759,1.9821,1.1121,8.5179,0.5885,9.6513,0.0798,2.2509,2.063,4.05,0.6315,4.1362,0.7186,0.6941,1.9404,3.9533,5.4495,6.5579,6.675,0.7624,1.9146,0.0024,0.2034,1.337,1.9405,6.3916,5.1263,6.3499,3.3416,4.7424,3.0736,4.9294,0.6267,3.0374,2.1158,3.9676,3.4978,1.0643,9.3508,0.6543,5.1911,6.9157,4.0189,3.315,0.7448,5.3871,6.864,0.4056,4.8741,9.2446,1.8847,4.1702,4.7143,1.6412,4.9082,1.2757,5.2527,0.0127,0.1948,4.4841,2.1464,5.7446,5.4929,0.9848,3.7903,3.5823,1.215,3.6718,0.2684,5.2154,8.8022,4.342,5.6102,6.7283,2.3346,1.0476,3.4021,4.8343,0.8937,4.193,6.3915,0.8515,3.7658,0.4725,0.1341,0.815,5.6331,5.6312,3.0708,4.7185,9.7335,5.8518,2.2767,3.2298,2.3142,0.27,4.7173,3.4863,2.1016,0.2409,5.8999,0.4066,0.3367,4.934,1.896,7.6393,4.9679,2.2233,2.12,6.4909,2.5659,2.5773,8.0384,7.3773,0.116,5.7038,0.0115,3.4872,2.7765,1.6328,0.9109,1.4618,5.5875,0.0109,0.387,2.2201,2.3217,6.594,0.1204,1.0643,5.0557,7.2524,0.0833,3.4045,6.3913,2.8488,1.7701,3.2259,1.5127,9.1082,0.1478,0.8061,1.525,1.9688,2.7063,5.9686,1.5414,1.4717,1.687,1.0381,0.7673,3.3204,0.9802,1.2856,4.3783,1.2271,5.9399,3.7278,1.5489,0.1116,6.6564,6.4478,4.072,5.9164,4.9821,8.3582,8.5906,2.0689,4.6016,7.1459,1.5519,1.0416,0.2369,3.5156,4.5121,1.9208,2.287,0.9226,3.4333,0.0792,1.1138,2.4765,4.2283,1.4465,0.0008,0.9924,5.2404,1.3393,8.2738,0.2071,0.1145,0.8941,7.9361,3.7303,7.5858,3.9773,6.0552,4.3969,5.7837,2.9175,3.9516,2.0934,1.1421,2.0627,1.8548,1.7204,3.0677,8.7681,9.7132,6.4574,8.6192,0.8257,5.1681,2.3309,2.1184,5.1478,4.386,0.0619,0.2481,0.5229,6.6325,0.2609,4.0405,2.2798,5.687,7.5111,0.0039,3.8201,4.8824,1.5823,1.9151,2.5604,1.7979,5.7537,0.1071,0.7459,4.5294,0.7691,4.2649,3.7899,5.1957,0.6428,1.4669,0.4337,1.4501,1.789,6.0391,1.7978,2.771,6.9195,1.0173,1.7649,2.2075,0.8985,6.2986,2.3385,6.0455,3.8865,0.9877,0.0005,2.6963,2.8981,0.0305,5.8518,0.8988,5.0461,0.6392,3.8872,5.5043,0.7158,3.8482,0.8047,4.258,0.0314,0.1906,0.8176,3.4136,6.3645,0.094,0.6683,4.579,0.9402,0.0413,2.3423,5.8838,3.6208,0.1238,7.144,0.7152,2.2217,2.1498,2.342,2.9657,0.0813,2.5602,1.7949,0.003,0.364,1.2135,2.5223,0.6497,3.2367,0.8221,0.4034,5.7399,4.6816,3.1991,0.1868,8.1518,6.9431,0.0895,2.2081,1.6522,7.6907,0.5389,5.1192,0.4918,2.8296,0.5916,0.8502,4.4165,2.5397,0.5588,5.2458,2.963,8.4649,0.4849,1.9758,1.5253,3.6269,3.3505,1.7541,3.4585,5.2329,0.0474,3.9488,0.7621,0.0012,0.2245,0.7149,3.8078,1.6479,0.0018,0.0277,0.2205,4.4183,2.4739,0.2729,1.9207,0.2137,4.7891,1.2444,0.6577,4.0568,2.546,1.9452,0.263,2.0939,2.4969,0.9895,3.4502,0.2718,0.0016,2.3755,3.1913,0.6124,2.36,3.8665,0.2916,2.5128,3.6991,1.8526,0.0821,5.2658,5.1063,3.3809,2.9934,2.8082,0.9062,3.0408,0.8867,1.2635,0.5558,5.6429,0.0787,2.1806,4.8227,6.9757,0.0075,0.0021,3.7572,1.3514,5.5665,2.105,0.3022,4.0779,0.2262,1.1414,1.3585,0.5568,2.25,2.035,7.7155,1.6394,2.7212,7.0868,0.0992,5.3994,2.389,9.2984,0.0016,0.2101,6.5628,3.5132,0.6424,1.4818,3.9104,2.9259,0.0028,4.4633,6.9839,2.1425,3.582,1.1037,0.0071,0.1252,2.1783,1.5872,5.6093,0.0691,1.5483,1.426,7.7517,5.1035,3.3816,0.8666,6.2719,0.3149,7.5076,5.1488,1.8672,6.6093,0.7449,1.3534,3.6073,8.0546,12.4907,4.997,1.0021,2.0205,5.2627,0.2278,5.79,0.0456,0.258,7.3818,2.3759,4.1193,2.3091,6.448,0.6424,0.0073,7.9398,0.0996,3.672,2.3342,2.6668,7.044,8.951,2.1252,0.971,6.2471,0.2004,2.0901,5.8718,4.5722,2.6124,0.4547,5.5257,0.5807,0.2633,3.713,1.6974,3.602,3.8217,2.5888,0.9522,5.4754,3.9107,1.4525,3.4835,4.4314,6.1259,2.3998,5.323,5.0941,0.2305,3.2842,3.3555,0.8365,1.8647,0.0031,4.9264,4.2821,1.8034,2.234,1.1894,0.0006,4.2674,1.1667,2.7306,2.6795,0.544,0.5384,0.0127,0.2318,0.998,3.6047,6.3548,0.1379,1.0971,2.2681,3.8627,0.1512,3.8083,6.1212,4.9519,2.0464,5.1546,4.018,1.2459,3.2133,3.9606,9.0071,0.3979,0.0012,4.9377,0.3441,1.8742,2.217,5.4538,2.4184,0.9661,1.7139,1.6621,4.2538,1.6177,1.351,4.343,1.7355,2.7299,0.6417,0.8862,5.6881,2.0483,1.194,0.8761,2.1684,2.7878,3.4286,2.0441,0.6501,1.9008,3.1207,0.2919,4.0595,1.3652,7.1245,0.514,0.2994,3.0948,0.702,6.5469,0.2855,1.6014,6.1958,1.1804,2.623,0.7295,0.002,0.0314,1.247,3.246,1.4079,2.4249,0.1247,1.4245,3.398,2.4936,5.5636,1.1126,2.1832,4.8099,5.7548,3.2146,1.9118,3.3841,0.5795,1.1237,3.0244,0.0217,5.2457,2.3684,1.3147,1.7785,0.0137,3.6401,0.5721,6.3331,3.2393,0.0448,3.6353,0.1629,1.0614,4.7176,0.1415,0.1644,2.6235,0.0261,0.0006,5.4096,0.7469,4.5798,0.2277,0.7319,0.9123,0.4399,1.7153,3.0968,1.8536,3.5271,2.08,0.0328,0.828,5.7115,2.847,1.3557,4.2764,0.5087,4.8369,0.0551,0.943,0.5344,5.9803,3.1546,0.0418,0.1649,0.1415,0.335,1.507,3.1244,0.1323,0.8524,5.8939,1.2857,6.8148,0.3283,8.9723,2.6231,1.3828,4.1234,0.702,0.23,3.0438,4.1793,0.0063,0.3243,6.7483,0.019,1.1525,0.0429,0.3267,5.4949,3.0768,1.2469,0.0788,13.1344,11.1124,1.836,2.0943,6.0961,5.447,1.707,0.6771,3.7583,6.5329,6.6015,0.2302,0.394,6.2588,4.9804,0.8526,1.6639,2.7107,0.0987,5.1084,1.0263,0.4528,1.5716,1.4482,1.7574,4.2656,3.4392,4.7796,0.8272,5.34

{"prompt":"Kyle Dunamis ( < unk > \u30fb < unk > , < unk > < unk > ) is the main protagonist of Destiny 2 . Kyle is very much like his father , Stahn","text":"Kyle Dunamis ( < unk > \u30fb < unk >, < unk > < unk > ) is the main protagonist of Destiny 2. Kyle is very much like his father, Stahn Dennet. He was born in Destiny, and he is also in charge of guarding Destiny along with his father, as well as his two siblings. Kyle was assigned as leader of the guardians of Destiny who are called the Rangers. He is the only one of the Rangers who had lived through multiple years on the Destiny and he is one of the few humans who have met a life mate outside Destiny.\nThis week will include several important new features. There are some interesting additions as well, for those of you who have been waiting for some time.\nThis past weekend, we updated our new Gifted Program. This is a wonderful program that focuses on making sure all who are gifted or talented have access to our resources.\nIt gives a big boost when we know that our students are getting a lot of support and guidance. This feature is available at Gifted. If you would like to try it out, you can take advantage of our gifted teacher code, and you will get a free month of support.\nIt is also exciting to see our new Talent Program. This is a program that encourages student interest and curiosity, with respect for and understanding their talents and strengths. There will also be a special page in there that gives parents and students ideas on how to celebrate and further explore their talents. Also, this program will include a new book club page. You will have access to recommendations and a place to keep in touch.\nAs we grow and expand, there are always new things that we have to do. This past weekend, we did a big cleanup. And a lot of it was due to our wonderful new teachers.\nThere are over a dozen new people at our school. And it will take time for them to be up to speed, and to adjust to the way our school operates. That was why I took a good look after school yesterday. To make sure there was nothing going on that needed my attention. I spent quite a lot of time doing that. And I want to thank all the teachers for taking the time to help me. They are amazing, and we are very excited to have them on board.\nIt is an exciting time, and we know we have a very big school to work with, and much work to do. I think you will be glad that you made it to this page. For sure, it will be worth it.\nOur new feature this week is a new feature on school supplies. We have created several new pages that will cover just this topic. You can find the site at\nWe are going to be covering this subject from a number of different angles, with our new resources available for your personal use. We have been working on them in recent weeks, and this is a time to get them ready for your use. There are some great resources, and it is always interesting to get feedback from parents and students about the materials that we introduce.\nWe have all been working hard over the past ten years. And we have learned a lot. We know we have a lot more work to do. But we are very excited about the new opportunities that we have to create for ourselves, and for our students. It is a very exciting time!\nThis past weekend, I was asked to create a little something. It was for an online fundraiser, and it is a piece that I believe every student and parent at Skyhook would appreciate. So, I will be doing that for next Tuesday. But I have not created it yet.

Although some 330 @, @ 000 troops of the Bulgarian Army are believed to have been killed or wounded ( many of whom were captured and subsequently executed ), the actual casualties in the war are unknown, but the Bulgarian Empire ( from the point of perspective when the war began ) was irretrievably defeated. The war was eventually ended in 1913 with a Treaty ending the First Balkan War that was signed between Bulgaria and Austria, and the Treaty ended the Second Balkan War that was signed between Romania and Bulgaria. The Treaty guaranteed independence for Bulgaria.\nThe French Revolution, in which Louis XVI became the first victim of the new era, and also the suppression of the constitutional monarchy by Napoleon\nIn January 1989 the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic, and Hungary declared themselves independent, although these three countries remained part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In April 1990 the three republics, now each having their own elected government, organized a common European Union and NATO membership referendum where they voted to remain in Yugoslavia. The referendum became known as the Referendum on the Continuity of the Socialist Federal Republic and resulted in 72 percent votes to remain in Yugoslavia, and 28 percent votes to leave Yugoslavia. All three republics have made their independence unambiguous throughout a long period of their life. On the other hand, in the case of other states, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, there was no general agreement on the status of these countries.\nBy the 1930s a socialist system had been established in Eastern and Central Europe. Many of former monarchies were renamed republics, and many of the new republics adopted Socialism, a system that would be eventually suppressed and ultimately ended during the socialist years.\nBefore a republic was officially formed its leaders elected representatives to be elected to the legislature. The legislature would also elect a chief of state. The elected chief of state ( generally a president ), as the figurehead of this newly formed republic, would be responsible for the management and implementation of national issues, including legislation, national military administration of various ministries and government agencies, and appointing officials and military officials, the implementation of decisions of the other branches of the government, and of some other governmental policies.\nThe legislative branch of government, often called the parliament or legislature, in the new republics was elected through a secret ballot and would serve an indefinite period as elected officials of the republic. Representatives and senators of the republics also voted on the ratification of the constitution ( adopted into law and the primary law that set the fundamental guidelines of the republic ), the ratification of treaties or agreements ( signed by the elected leaders of the sovereign republics ), and a number of other issues. If the republics were elected officials then they would be accountable to the elected leaders ; if they were appointed officials, they were accountable to the head of state.\nIn the 1950s many of the republics in Eastern and Central Europe were formed as part of the communist regimes ( communist dictatorships ) led by the Communist Party. The leaders of these communist regimes believed that socialism was the only way to guarantee political and social stability and progress in the newly formed states. Within the communist countries a central authority set all monetary policy, set minimum wage rates, prices, and labor laws, set educational standards and other standards that would ensure the economic, social, and political stability and progress of the countries under communist rule. A number of these communist regimes set up nationalized industries ( factories and farms ), allowing the state to control all resources, production, and distribution. These nationalized resources ( oil reserves, coal reserves, natural water reservoirs, and other strategic commodities ) were used to help maintain a state-run socialist ( communist ) economy.","token_len":776,"entropy":[11.7847,4.0759,6.318,0.9648,7.6206,5.8291,0.0091,0.2074,4.8886,2.0592,2.6478,7.029,3.4942,0.1892,3.615,7.4645,11.2171,3.6037,5.3684,3.1987,11.57,0.4167,0.0514,1.9452,12.0531,10.2449,6.7615,5.5924,4.8267,4.9748,5.3839,9.3431,15.56,5.8681,5.2373,10.4903,2.896,3.8766,0.6589,2.7683,0.9737,4.578,5.2561,0.0743,0.2213,0.892,1.7936,2.7853,0.4268,4.3214,6.5232,1.2853,1.6225,0.6098,2.4849,2.3484,4.0508,3.1124,2.5229,1.2989,4.1391,2.8212,3.6731,0.5116,2.0653,1.5934,1.7843,2.598,3.5918,1.9635,3.717,6.5024,3.6397,7.047,1.7674,5.2038,0.1048,6.3944,9.5171,1.226,3.0323,1.0304,2.7696,2.0773,10.3363,2.4742,0.0054,0.0001,0.0223,2.4344,1.3504,1.8874,4.4788,1.8683,4.7346,1.9971,1.9449,7.0795,2.5579,2.3757,5.6009,8.5246,0.6777,5.941,0.0712,0.0019,0.1105,4.8661,2.3374,4.3495,3.1837,1.5516,0.1239,4.4897,2.2181,1.5621,1.6642,4.3242,2.9126,0.9708,0.8475,0.0452,0.0013,0.0027,1.9954,0.978,3.4461,0.3571,2.3786,0.0541,0.4502,0.883,1.94,4.1161,8.7251,5.2678,1.4336,1.1497,3.4621,1.9271,4.2414,6.637,3.7948,3.3015,2.4165,2.2844,6.8003,1.2434,3.6956,1.2404,0.5644,8.2515,0.2194,1.1983,6.1614,6.5817,1.4124,4.0886,4.5724,1.4675,7.7081,0.0872,0.7653,7.303,0.7371,2.8022,2.6649,6.9661,2.7311,5.066,6.6516,1.9467,8.4658,0.0926,0.6852,2.4446,2.6938,3.9466,0.4593,0.4586,1.0663,2.32,3.6916,2.4893,1.134,2.2244,4.0363,4.8221,4.5947,1.0226,3.3535,2.3005,0.0083,0.4314,5.6652,5.8001,0.057,0.573,1.1981,1.2205,2.0357,3.053,1.5347,1.07,7.6759,4.3183,0.0199,2.5219,5.8929,5.342,4.0363,3.5245,0.0064,5.1135,1.845,0.3165,7.0686,0.8316,5.5052,5.5483,2.7962,3.673,5.4727,5.1407,3.9027,6.4217,2.1493,1.1565,1.4916,2.3452,0.957,6.184,0.8407,1.6356,2.0245,5.575,1.5313,0.0475,0.338,4.8982,0.0061,0.0003,2.1843,1.484,6.9107,0.6357,0.0274,1.0997,4.2346,1.6375,0.0824,4.8722,4.348,0.0094,8.5825,2.4486,6.4132,2.1107,0.4729,0.394,0.925,1.8532,2.5205,5.1794,0.1765,4.0619,0.128,1.2976,3.4193,0.2498,5.9069,1.2418,2.0779,0.0096,2.7435,5.5993,3.0501,3.0824,8.237,0.235,4.811,6.5395,2.6241,0.9905,0.1283,4.715,5.1155,1.0015,4.886,2.5651,1.5221,0.0718,0.1814,2.327,2.1828,3.4278,0.0151,6.7261,4.0133,0.9081,2.0822,0.0089,4.866,0.4648,0.0393,0.0002,0.0002,0.0009,1.8064,2.6064,0.2725,3.4953,2.5541,1.5393,5.5289,2.257,1.0568,1.3167,2.8809,0.097,3.1104,2.7736,1.0893,1.5849,5.4738,1.4673,5.7278,0.0895,4.3835,6.1586,4.2966,1.6284,1.3046,0.7087,0.644,4.7122,3.4191,0.5221,0.0446,1.8666,5.5238,1.6709,8.7925,8.0807,0.5754,2.3694,7.618,4.8152,0.0021,1.4357,1.4334,2.3265,1.4044,1.4866,3.6049,1.257,0.0168,3.9969,7.5864,2.3571,3.7685,2.3618,1.7252,3.8559,2.9741,6.0287,8.8223,2.5307,5.126,3.0379,4.96,0.3326,5.9187,4.0382,0.584,2.0723,5.9788,5.3512,4.1217,0.8408,4.3674,2.6489,5.5317,3.7363,4.9422,2.7646,3.4902,3.6931,2.9761,1.0837,1.0081,4.8134,1.1618,1.5261,3.395,3.3361,4.1187,2.2492,1.8813,5.3237,2.5894,1.0151,1.9794,1.2078,3.8491,3.6259,0.4313,0.0216,3.985,8.917,1.798,5.1367,5.0287,3.6769,3.0996,7.1825,0.5187,0.4837,4.6493,4.9632,0.6837,1.6331,0.3253,1.0294,1.7217,2.6744,0.0948,1.7244,5.0012,1.9851,3.7179,0.0064,4.7058,4.9366,1.696,2.3306,5.319,0.6784,4.4867,6.2401,7.0837,5.3442,5.7286,4.1536,1.9723,5.0628,3.3462,0.3005,1.0288,8.9433,4.0788,2.6042,4.9491,3.2951,3.2348,4.6961,7.0203,0.0447,7.9447,1.9527,0.5529,6.9463,2.1303,0.1258,1.0106,0.9344,0.3391,0.5216,4.2412,5.8708,1.5791,3.409,6.9231,0.441,1.5227,1.3269,5.152,2.9276,0.5784,1.9153,2.2564,4.3318,0.932,0.3149,4.0956,3.3703,3.7741,0.2648,5.4224,1.7958,4.6215,0.5383,0.7113,1.5776,3.334,3.0807,1.2521,5.0977,0.1252,3.3118,4.0236,4.5381,5.9828,3.1048,1.417,5.2029,4.8691,3.0727,3.3064,0.3391,2.0738,0.457,5.7769,4.2396,2.4704,2.6548,0.6277,2.372,1.5984,3.2194,4.5218,1.2802,2.3108,5.4255,0.3239,1.2186,2.2034,3.4701,7.7451,5.6507,0.1655,4.1983,5.2874,8.1657,1.6442,4.0154,5.9255,0.8727,6.785,6.5672,1.9558,0.5982,1.5586,2.9853,1.8572,2.3097,0.0901,2.4328,4.9913,1.7305,2.2025,3.6936,0.7939,0.7859,5.2349,3.5893,0.6813,0.4048,7.7781,0.7575,0.1683,1.0469,0.6913,4.7797,0.8474,0.0045,0.124,2.3274,0.9123,5.7196,1.0917,2.6075,1.9019,2.0915,4.5432,5.8001,5.0894,1.3555,0.9584,1.3256,4.4824,0.3502,0.3056,3.5211,2.2163,9.3542,1.5422,1.3897,0.3463,4.6165,2.3826,1.2736,0.5978,2.3685,1.98,0.0671,0.1756,5.2895,0.0189,1.0865,1.2466,1.113,2.4649,1.2701,5.0665,0.0319,4.3064,1.7309,0.17,2.5506,0.0327,4.0709,0.9777,1.2248,0.0251,0.0169,1.7108,3.5444,2.639,3.4158,0.0014,0.5965,4.6021,4.1441,4.1705,5.1384,4.4614,0.0392,2.0881,6.1636,0.0106,1.1116,4.3,0.2837,2.9359,1.6883,5.1459,0.0789,0.6972,2.2339,0.3002,6.76,0.349,3.848,1.0378,1.1166,0.6172,1.1599,0.2505,4.4182,5.2434,1.8165,1.6779,1.5449,1.5383,5.9258,1.3879,0.7012,6.1295,1.8229,4.7953,0.6648,6.6977,0.9252,0.7749,4.405,4.0833,5.0088,3.9297,5.5911,6.6408,7.9481,2.6155,1.2088,7.082,5.0076,2.0191,3.0568,0.2851,9.0885,1.1782,1.1981,4.7088,2.1569,0.7693,3.8366,5.5038,1.3535,2.0061,3.9828,3.2568,4.0596,2.3912,2.2859,1.5836,3.4774,4.139,0.4575,0.319,0.4648,0.8859,1.1756,2.6841,1.4848,0.141,0.3005,3.7251,3.333,1.9141,0.4462,0.2292,5.0249,2.6216,0.0461,2.7893,0.9933,0.3474,5.4499,2.6457,4.2174,5.6653,2

The competition drawings were circulated on display, 25 @, @ 000 coming to see them in Chicago in the fall of 1920. As was the case with the City Council, the public felt that it had its say in the design and construction of the skyscrapers. During the city planning years, the city was divided into districts by the Chicago City Plan Commission. With the completion of the buildings, the commission made proposals for dividing each district into smaller subdivisions. Plans were sent to the Public Works Committee for consideration. Often it was found that there were significant disparities in proposed designs, and improvements to the streets and sidewalks needed to be included for the new districts. One of the most memorable and controversial projects in Chicago's history was a proposal to create new neighborhoods and sidewalks on the north side of Chicago Avenue. The Public Works Committee decided that the north side of Chicago Avenue would be kept as a freeway for heavy traffic. As far as sidewalks were concerned, the city would construct them in such a manner that they would not intrude upon the traffic area. The design of sidewalks and streets was another area of controversy that was never fully decided in the public sphere. By 1927, the city had begun to build a line of parkways on the north side of the city. The line would extend from the West Park to the West Side and from Grand to Adams and would include all the city parkways. At one time it was proposed to take out the entire west side of Chicago Avenue ; however, this project was never fully implemented.\nMany other projects were designed by city planners at the time. When the Grand Hotel was built in 1906, most of the construction materials were brought in by railroad. A sectioned-off street was planned along with a traffic and sidewalk system to support the heavy traffic generated by the new building. This construction left the street in such a condition that it was declared unwalkable. The City Council approved a plan to fill in this space, extend sidewalks on the other side of the street and expand sidewalks out front of the hotel. The construction of the building had a major impact on the street itself, and the City Council responded by expanding the original sidewalks and redesigning the road to allow more space to be made available. Much of the work done during this period is still visible to this day.\nAlthough many developments took place in Chicago during the decade of the 1920s, the following decade still featured many great developments. The decade was not without its setbacks as well.\nThe collapse of the great depression began during the decade ; however, most of the real estate activity during the decade was not related to the real estate markets but to a growing demand for housing. The great depression took the economy down, and the real estate market did not take off until the war broke out. As the economy recovered, the real estate market started to show some signs of life. The development of skyscrapers became a major focus during the 1930s and the 1940s. The number of skyscrapers increased, and many of the city's buildings are considered to be among the finest examples of the period.\nThe period after the war was one of great change in the development and the growth of the city. There was a rapid growth in the population as the federal government began to move into the city. In 1947, most of the federal buildings were destroyed in a fire in Washington D.C. The federal government moved into the building complex that had been the city hall since the original Chicago City Hall was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. The old City Hall was used as a temporary office building, and construction was started immediately on a new structure. The new City Hall served as a permanent site of government government of the city until it was moved into its new location in

{"prompt":"In the 1940s , when Herg\u00e9 's popularity had increased , he redrew many of the original black @ - @ and @ - @ white Tintin adventures in colour using the ligne claire (","text":"In the 1940s, when Herg\u00e9's popularity had increased, he redrew many of the original black @ - @ and @ - @ white Tintin adventures in colour using the ligne claire ( line drawn ) style of the C.C.. R. T. ( C.C.. Royal Court Theatre ) ( the line drawn style ) which was being used by the French novelist Emile Zola in his work. Herg\u00e9 was influenced by his friend Georges Pessarofsky. Herg\u00e9 drew the scenes with a pen and then used photographs of the scenes as a guide.\nDuring the Second World War more than half of the Herg\u00e9 archive was destroyed in the war's bombing of Brussels, but the rest were saved and now resides at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris.\nThe Tintin books are a big series, and they can be found in many countries.\nIn fact in Britain, Scotland and Ireland the series is so popular that on the 21st December, 1975, Scotland's national day is known as'Tintin day,'for on that day in the 1950s one of Herg\u00e9's albums, The Road to Earth's Treasures, was published.\nIn fact, it was the first cartoon book published in Britain that was actually printed there, at the Bury St Edmunds Press.\nIn 1975, there was Tintin day in France, and in Holland Tintin day is celebrated in March. But other countries celebrate it during the spring \/ summer months too.\nHerg\u00e9, himself, is an active member of the Tintin Club in Paris, where he gives lectures and talks.\nHerg\u00e9's life was cut short in April of 1984, after a long period of illness, and he was interred at the cemetery at Louvain-laNeuve, in Belgium.\nAt the beginning of March a memorial was held in his honour in Brussels, and on that occasion the Belgian Prime Minister declared the 20th of that month'Tintin day,'and Herg\u00e9's funeral was held in the same month.\nIt seems that the books by Herg\u00e9 have become too popular and too many of them have been published.\nThis is the reason for this huge number of Tintin books.It would take me a long time to read through all these books. I have just started The Temple of Forbidden Magic by Alex Verus and so far so good.\nI have also found another excellent science fiction read, called The Tuskegee Airmen by Ralph Keyes, published by Heineman. Ralph Keyes is an author I have not read before and this book is by far the best one so far. The idea of science fiction being true to science is a good one. It seems to have caught the mainstream.\nAnother book which I really enjoyed, especially the chapter on Space and Religion.\nThis one by Robert Sheckley was published in 1952 and is a short story collection. This was my first copy but I am glad I bought the paperback version of the book, as it is a good paperback.\nI will say that Sheckley was an influential member of the so-called New Wave of British science fiction in the 1950s.\nThe book I am reading now, The Tuskegee Airmen by Ralph Keyes, is also important as it talks about the real life events surrounding the flight of the Tuskegee Airmen.\nAfter reading the short stories in the book I can now say that I am an even bigger fan of his work than I was. It was the realism of his stories that really impressed me, and at times I wanted to go back and read one of his novels to find out more about this remarkable group of men.","token_len":777,"entropy":[2.6222,7.4969,0.1084,0.3809,2.9511,9.9807,6.9395,0.5453,2.727,6.451,3.6979,3.4929,0.7947,1.9556,9.8706,3.8156,4.8464,0.3794,0.7895,4.4361,7.4652,14.6955,8.3283,5.8119,2.5573,1.6362,1.8213,1.199,7.6299,8.1766,8.2136,3.7706,11.8281,2.426,6.5415,6.4058,2.0906,7.6679,6.7056,8.1811,3.8479,3.7423,12.7612,5.6747,3.401,4.4609,1.8624,1.4616,6.8594,2.9821,3.4122,6.2394,6.2668,1.4695,5.6718,1.0924,4.4338,5.1871,0.4725,0.9713,3.1632,7.6746,4.5811,7.1741,1.2513,4.3866,5.3622,4.3281,0.6195,8.2943,1.7765,3.8988,1.6187,7.064,1.0145,1.6065,1.4317,3.9077,7.4219,7.5066,0.0585,4.6621,0.8847,1.6155,0.782,4.0749,3.6517,3.7507,0.4924,0.0008,2.714,5.0905,0.2195,3.6608,2.9762,5.0393,0.2464,4.0173,6.0263,4.0324,6.367,4.2327,2.8755,2.657,0.5164,0.0021,5.2773,1.9552,7.3014,3.645,1.981,5.2701,1.0457,4.6454,2.5658,7.1597,1.3336,1.3023,4.1395,2.9718,2.343,2.7283,1.0798,2.3747,8.0159,0.6495,4.8838,0.0268,0.0014,8.7382,0.9828,3.2611,0.5824,0.6348,6.4615,0.1412,0.0059,8.8553,0.7608,1.1741,2.016,1.2442,2.8748,4.055,5.6363,0.8728,7.5744,2.0677,2.9217,1.7776,3.1339,3.4285,4.0366,3.0077,5.537,3.4438,2.3595,0.7011,4.9601,0.9466,0.7358,0.0007,0.003,0.3067,0.1718,2.1365,0.4748,0.4331,1.342,2.0568,5.744,0.1292,0.0605,5.3844,1.729,3.2458,6.396,8.1821,2.4289,2.4016,2.914,4.2488,0.3371,1.8576,0.9163,1.8065,4.4567,1.2636,2.0753,3.4634,4.9804,5.2924,5.1099,1.1565,6.8914,0.7474,2.0073,1.9995,4.323,1.2568,4.822,0.9329,0.3846,5.9252,1.6652,5.8281,0.0334,4.2741,2.2626,5.9238,0.6223,6.5787,1.5249,5.5731,5.2924,5.761,5.5577,0.2769,11.8355,1.5223,0.0861,0.0257,3.8145,4.7539,10.0071,6.4293,1.3739,0.4108,3.0385,2.3776,5.2393,0.0451,5.9904,0.9095,2.1078,0.081,0.0015,0.1136,9.1931,1.7123,2.5367,7.0647,0.7225,7.5376,4.126,7.8349,0.1111,0.6599,0.4058,2.0015,0.6843,1.2425,2.4117,4.7193,1.2367,3.3237,0.9197,2.3138,2.4811,10.275,2.7918,2.4481,0.8278,2.4556,2.4838,2.4432,3.3413,2.9452,6.554,1.7302,5.1273,0.9133,3.0158,8.9258,1.3668,0.5126,0.8345,4.4508,1.7234,1.0296,2.1414,4.8303,0.7557,4.758,0.7183,10.4246,0.0612,0.0055,1.6351,1.3878,3.3371,0.9981,1.7345,1.6766,7.7725,3.6065,0.0058,0.004,1.2792,2.6066,1.6422,0.9186,5.8683,1.666,5.1017,5.8394,2.1784,2.149,1.3178,5.2173,0.836,5.3976,8.2193,0.2406,0.696,3.3337,0.6491,0.7875,5.8932,8.1439,0.0422,3.3361,5.8539,0.794,2.5282,3.3851,4.2625,1.1182,0.0272,0.3149,2.8962,0.0065,0.0065,4.6387,2.6306,2.3909,1.2443,2.2289,0.3814,4.5684,1.4592,1.4434,2.9008,2.1722,1.1952,3.0498,0.2491,0.0033,2.2627,4.8884,2.2744,6.0748,0.0115,1.2137,4.999,2.1935,5.4531,1.6317,2.6189,2.1079,3.4702,3.2061,0.3032,2.181,1.6433,1.7593,1.2069,1.5039,9.9956,0.2012,1.0778,0.9829,4.6695,2.7649,5.1868,1.3764,0.0032,1.9385,4.3217,13.9219,0.3554,1.9656,1.4202,4.2461,0.424,0.8303,4.5543,0.7996,4.6337,0.0665,4.4705,5.563,2.933,0.8105,3.2005,1.2604,2.9879,0.5661,1.9764,4.0426,0.9001,1.9407,2.8867,2.699,2.0116,1.8248,4.1932,4.4962,0.0109,4.9698,2.2031,6.5319,0.1662,1.6842,4.3487,0.7732,6.7765,1.3205,0.0123,0.003,0.3598,4.739,3.0051,7.3035,0.1328,0.0007,2.1251,3.7369,0.5758,0.3326,1.3482,1.541,3.5552,6.2408,0.6699,0.3567,4.1658,3.93,0.563,2.2333,7.5397,6.0972,0.1397,0.0281,0.0008,3.1509,2.998,6.0891,0.7544,3.238,3.0802,3.8855,1.8236,0.9697,1.0432,0.7923,3.5214,1.8573,0.8038,4.3004,1.2681,2.7938,2.2729,3.0186,2.7656,4.9792,2.191,0.1043,1.8899,0.0207,0.0131,1.5302,1.6883,10.4329,4.0995,3.1586,4.724,1.5419,1.0045,0.0619,0.1909,3.2703,3.7508,1.2014,3.1171,0.5497,1.3394,2.0417,2.0508,4.7514,3.017,7.3167,9.0072,0.4297,8.8539,3.5607,2.914,7.3599,6.6277,6.2189,2.2926,6.3246,1.5763,4.3593,0.0328,0.8432,1.8836,1.8187,1.6694,2.0349,3.7498,5.0531,5.4087,8.3617,0.2153,6.9523,2.2559,4.3757,1.6093,10.2449,0.7638,0.0105,3.0272,0.4903,0.0184,3.8467,6.4012,8.1757,0.4856,1.6552,2.8967,1.3837,7.3519,1.39,4.2915,2.2112,9.7857,0.6643,0.001,1.2634,1.6698,2.395,5.0786,1.562,3.0367,0.8403,1.4685,1.948,3.4728,1.3002,0.7465,3.9267,3.7185,0.9613,0.3024,2.2555,4.1406,0.0075,0.2813,2.8653,5.487,0.9653,6.2631,0.1104,2.4291,6.7098,1.0473,4.4015,1.5853,2.3628,3.4782,0.3092,1.2776,2.5732,3.8699,1.6116,2.7138,5.4607,2.2866,6.8529,4.1509,0.9878,4.1243,2.3382,3.6037,0.8295,4.4342,1.4265,3.0042,7.5312,2.0138,5.9738,0.9188,6.4332,3.449,9.5284,3.8006,1.6619,2.5037,3.1918,3.7898,4.2108,6.3101,4.9024,1.1621,2.6419,0.9927,0.5917,5.3129,1.7214,1.8257,1.9377,4.8675,0.6095,3.4288,1.5753,3.4337,2.2841,4.3372,0.6283,5.2482,5.6575,0.9885,3.4195,2.6678,0.9965,1.8133,3.1464,3.5661,1.655,2.6424,1.7714,0.7206,2.8828,2.627,0.749,1.2033,1.9616,2.4322,7.1647,1.146,0.7545,1.8851,3.742,3.2553,0.7327,7.0699,0.0039,0.0011,2.1637,1.9763,4.5787,4.4259,0.0453,0.2997,7.2915,0.2675,0.0014,5.781,2.2321,1.441,4.9514,1.4561,0.0316,3.4891,0.3113,1.5588,0.0293,1.3502,1.5107,2.4977,2.7573,4.3354,2.1294,2.4958,2.5321,1.9689,0.9791,4.2758,0.0022,0.0004,0.0412,0.0003,0.0051,1.5387,1.0489,0.0052,0.0012,0.3502,0.699,3.4801,6.8275,3.2031,1.7341,6.6637,0.307,0.8511,5.899,2.8313,4.4923,4.6209,0.555,7.2866,0.2086,0.8351,2.713,0.0133,0.0006,0.0937,0.0004,0.0116,1.5388,0.7443,5.4316,1.6471,1.4545,5.6969,3.749,2.5883

There she met actor Ernest Borgnine who was on vacation. Borgnine was so impressed that she auditioned for the role of Norma Jeane Baker, the girlfriend of Elvis Presley, from the musical version of his 1968 film, Heart of Gold, where she played the bass guitar and sang lead vocals. After this audition Borgnine was able to arrange a recording session with Elvis Presley, who after hearing her bass guitar playing decided to cast her in the role of Norma Jeane Baker for his film. The recording session took place on December 23, 1968, for the album, Elvis Presley at the Grand Ole Opry, released some time later by RCA Victor Records. In the interview with the British Broadcasting Company that preceded the recording session, Borgnine expressed his belief that because he had found so many talent in this young pianistic student, he thought that she ought to be working in the entertainment field. She was eventually able to find steady work with the Bluebird label, but decided to stop because of her commitment to music school. In spite of her lack of success in the recording field, she continued her lessons with Norman Kaye, a pianist and composer. Kaye was her teacher for ten years, and was considered to be her mentor, as he was in fact her father, although she referred to him as Norman (which was her nickname for him), which he always returned. When she left the Bluebird label in 1969, Kaye allowed her to continue to work as a pianist for his other clients (such as Ronnie Milsap and Bobby Brown). She then switched to teaching private piano lessons, focusing mainly on classical piano, but was later able to teach pop, jazz and rock. By 1979, she had moved to West Palm Beach in Florida, and was hired to teach privately in a music school there.\nShe continued on to be successful as a pianist and teacher, despite a few setbacks that were largely due to her work as a teacher. She suffered a career break when she was fired from her first job after teaching for 18 months. While she was still in New York City, she was unable to find a job. Eventually, she managed to find a job teaching at a high school in West Palm Beach, Florida, where she remained until her death. She was also successful as a pianist with the Dixie Chicks, and was able to make considerable sums of money as a result. After retiring, she was briefly employed as a pianist for Frank & Jesse James. She also played occasionally with the Dixie Chicks, and was often asked to play with several popular singers who were signed by Interscope Records. For example, she frequently played for Mary McCurdy after her second marriage, and played for Dionne Warwick, who after her second marriage to Barry Manilow decided to keep calling her as Dionne, and who later took an interest in her work as a pianist, and had her play an encore at the closing concert of a show.\nAt the age of 70, she recorded a new album entitled, Music is the Word, which was released in 1981 with Universal Music Studios. The title was dedicated to her husband, and it was the final recording made by Norma Jeane.\nOn August 23, 2018, Narducci announced that she had recently undergone a successful kidney transplant that restored her kidney function.

{"prompt":"Sebastian Vettel 's momentum continued one week later in Korea , winning his third consecutive race and taking a six @ - @ point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third . Vettel overcame pole","text":"Sebastian Vettel's momentum continued one week later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six @ - @ point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole for Michael Schumacher to win comfortably from pole position.\n\" I felt really fast there, \" he said. \" I could have really easily beaten Michael at one point today, but no time is wasted when you\u2019re fighting with Michael. You just see the whole race plan and try to put in your best lap for the moment. \"\n\" I didn\u2019t think anything would have gotten through my mind on the last lap because I saw a really good chance to get the points. I thought maybe we could get Vettel, but I didn\u2019t think a Williams car would have gotten through the field at that point. It was a really good weekend for the team. We just had a race plan. I think the team did an good job here. \"\n\" In Australia last weekend, I had some good starts, some good one-piece drives. This weekend I had some good one-piece starts, and I finished some of my finishes. There are a lot of changes on the track this weekend, and I think for some drivers it\u2019s going to be a challenge. I think it\u2019s going to give me a good base for the next couple of grand rounds. \"\nHamilton is the only driver to retain the top spot of fastest time for both drivers and teams to finish both the start and run to the finish of the race. Mercedes have been dominant in the standings for races at Baku and Silverstone and Lewis looked to continue this on Sunday.\nMercedes driver Nico Rosberg finished second in Baku and fifth a week later in Silverstone as he tries to maintain second in the championship standings.\nThe German has a 20 @ - @ point advantage over Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and was quickest at both Baku and Silverstone. He finished third in Baku and had second place at Silverstone a week earlier which looked to be his starting position for the opening week of a new Grand Prix in Europe.\n\" I think what I\u2019ve done this week is good, it has worked, I think we\u2019ve got a big team fight between us. We\u2019re in with a good chance of winning the championship. It\u2019s still a challenge, \" said Rosberg, adding.\n\" Every grand prix is different, you need to prepare for all the possibilities at the corners. A week ago, I would have said that my starting position was in the middle, and this week I would have said that it was the front row at least. \"\nFernando Alonso has been in good form over the last few weeks with a fourth-place finish last year in Korea before going on to finish third in the race a week later at Silverstone.\n\" I think we can be satisfied with this weekend. It\u2019s been good to make the points in this sport. Of course, we know it\u2019s not enough for the title. We have to focus on next weekend in Silverstone, \" he said, adding.\nRookie Jenson Button of McLaren finished fourth for the second time in a row despite having to retire on Saturday after two laps because of a fuel error. McLaren will be hoping for a better result when the championship reopens next week at Baku.\nVladimir Tatishchev led the opening part of the race before going off and starting the race from the pitlane with a broken engine.

One of these programs, for example, is the Brazilian Professional Program in Web Developers ( PROPWIN ), offered in the online format since January 2005, with the objective of offering a qualified and standardized professional to the market, as well as providing knowledge and skills that are required for a professional who wishes to work in the development industry. These programs, as they are known in Portuguese, have been very popular among the students, as well as the professors and the administrators of the universities, which have been extremely interested in the professional and cultural development of the individuals that join them.\nThe University also has a great number of scholarships, which support financially the students that wish to obtain advanced degrees in the UniCampi. Such support is given to both the regular courses and the distance programs, in which a total amount of nearly 8 million reais is distributed in the university's seven campuses. Currently, more than 11,800 students have been sponsored by the UniCampi. Some of these students have been able to obtain the Master of Engineering degree in Software Engineering, or even other degrees, thanks to the support given to them by various national foundations.\nThere are also other programs related to the university, such as the Open Campus \/ Uniclass, which, like the other university programs, has the objective of opening up its access to a larger number of individuals, especially, but not exclusively, in the areas in which the most frequent are in difficulty. In this case, more than 17,500 students have been supported annually by this mechanism.\nThe University currently has 27,700 students, 1,900 professors and 1,400 administrative assistants, and 1,200 professionals with professional experience as technical and pedagogical leaders. They currently have 30 branches, including: Campinas and Sao Carlos campuses ( 11,600 students); Rio Claro, Piracicaba, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, and Santos campuses ( 12,500 students ) ; Rio Claro Campus ( 1,800 students ) ; Jaboticabal Branch ( 1,500 students ).\nIn addition to the above programs, the UniCampi also has two other large programs that include some of the university's universities : the ProUni ( Programme to Support Bachelor's students ) and the Fies ( Federal Program of Investment in Education ).\nThe ProUni Program has assisted more than 800,000 students with financial support and in several undergraduate programs, such as nursing, management, engineering and business administration.

{"prompt":"Goater moved to Reading on 1 August 2003 .

Reading chairman John Madejski described the transfer as `` the biggest in Reading Football Club's history ``, but Goater's time there was not an easy or long one. At first he struggled to establish himself against league rivals Bristol City as he had failed to earn much in the league. He struggled to play regularly for three seasons, and in November 2005 reported that he had been offered a job in Greece which turned out to be a job writing football guides for the BBC. After the 2006 summer transfer window, Goater returned to Reading permanently on a free transfer, and joined their first team squad as the club returned to the Premier League in February 2006. It would prove to be his last spell in the Premier League, as he would soon see a move to the First Division upon the departure of manager Glenn Hoddle.\nGoater played one game for the first team under manager Martin O'Neill a home defeat to Manchester United in February 2007 and after a disappointing season began with his fourth spell on loan with fellow non-league side Leyton Orient in July 2007. He then joined Reading's third string team for the remainder of the season, starting all 12 games he played in, but was again loaned out for a further season the following summers in order to gain league experience. He again joined Leyton Orient in January 2008, but was released by his employers towards the end of the 2009 season and then made a brief return to the club on a longer loan spell from January to July 2009 in order to gain experience.\nIn October 2010, Goater was appointed manager of Northern Premier League Division Two club Yeovil Town before he was sacked in December that year; his tenure in the role only lasted 12 games and was followed by an unsuccessful spell as assistant manager at AFC Wimbledon. The following summer, Goater was announced as the manager of Southern Premier League Division Three club Walsall, taking over from Steve Fadden and with an ambition to get Walsall promoted to the Southern Premier League.\nOn 29 April 2010, Goater was appointed manager at Cheltenham Town, managing a squad without a first team player in three-and-a-half years. Goater succeeded Steve Davies after he was released from a two-year contract and led Cheltenham to their first promotion to League One, winning promotion to the Football League on 10 May 2014 after defeating Crewe Alexandra. However, Goater was sacked on 6 February 2015, by Cheltenham fans upset over the club's performance in what went down as one of the worst performances for a Cheltenham player in the Football League in recent history. Goater resigned at the end of March 2015 after Cheltenham lost the opening game of the season against Gillingham. During his six months in charge he had an unbeaten run in 19 games.\nGoater returned to the Premier League as an assistant manager with Tranmere Rovers, being appointed in September 2015 following the departure of Brian McDermott; his first game in charge was in a League Cup tie against Cardiff City on 8 November 2015. His tenure there lasted three months, in part due to the club's relegation to the Conference South, and Goater was sacked at the end of the 2016-17 season. Following the club's eventual return to the Football League, Goater was signed by Tranmere on a temporary contract as an assistant to new manager Keith Gill before leaving the Rovers side in March 2018.

{"prompt":"Although Edward has the same background and characteristics in the manga and anime , Edward meets different people and fights against variable enemies . In the first anime , Edward learns the secret to destroying","text":"Although Edward has the same background and characteristics in the manga and anime, Edward meets different people and fights against variable enemies. In the first anime, Edward learns the secret to destroying time and space and uses it to create an infinite loop. In the manga, Edward learns the secret by accident, and the method of destroying time requires him to create infinite loops of himself to create a barrier that blocks the enemy's attack. In the manga as well as the anime, Edward only uses his energy to destroy time and space. In the anime, Edward can use his attack to destroy the opponent's energy bar. In the manga, Edward can also use his attack to steal the energy of the opponent, although this attack is slower. In the anime, Edward can use his energy to steal the energy of the opponents.\n3. Analysis of the Relationship between Edward and Alice\nIn the anime, Edward has strong emotions when he first meets Alice. Edward's initial impression of Alice is that she has a weird, shy girl's nature. However, after spending a series of series of memories with Alice, Edward gradually fell in love with Alice, and when Edward finally broke the limit after meeting Alice, he has an overwhelming, but also strong, need to kill himself and Alice. Edward loves Alice very much in the original series of Alice in Wonderland. At the same time, Alice is also fascinated by Edward. The two of them can be described as an unlikely match. In other cases, the character of Alice is not directly influenced as a man, and the influence of Alice on Edward lies in the memory of the past. Edward's personality is not very changeable, so the influence of the memory on the personality of Edward is not very big. However, the role of the memory of the past in Edward's personality is to affect his actions and behavior. Edward's decision to save Alice is based on Alice's influence on his personality.\nIn the original graphic novel, Alice decides to marry Edward. At that time, Alice decides that she needs Edward, even if Edward has to sacrifice his life to her : She did not care about the time, age, environment, or the background of the future, she was ready to give up everything to join Edward's destiny. Edward is the person who really wants to become an amazing man who can fight through tragedy, and can save the people who are loved by her. This kind of dream is Alice's only hope and desire. Although Alice is still very afraid of the future, and prefers not to be afraid of the future, and it seems more and more unlikely, because she is very fond of Edward. In the end, she still decides to stay with her dream. Because the desire to become a man who can fight through tragedy is very strong in her heart.\nAfter the first meeting, Edward and Alice have a lot of mutual understanding. As the two slowly fall in love, Alice often plays games with Edward to make him sad and cry. In this way, she wants to get as much experience as possible from playing the most difficult role, but also because it really makes her feel very happy. The happiness Alice feels when she plays the game is very similar to the happiness she feels when she meets Edward for the first time.\nThe difference is that after a series of series of memory with Edward, the happiness Alice feels is not limited to playing games with Edward, but also includes the joy of knowing Edward. In addition, the feelings of the two gradually change when the relationship between the two deepens.\nIn the end, there is nothing more than killing each other.

{"prompt":"At OS Grid Reference < unk > ( 53 @ . @ < unk > \u00b0 , \u2212 2 @ . @ 1594 \u00b0 ) , Rochdale Town Hall is the centerpiece of Rochdale ,","text":"At OS Grid Reference < unk > ( 53 @. @ < unk > \u00b0, \u2212 2 @. @ 1594 \u00b0 ), Rochdale Town Hall is the centerpiece of Rochdale, the county seat of Derbyshire, England. Located roughly five miles south of Bradford, Rochdale is one of only several large towns in Derbyshire. With a population of, the town is one of the wealthiest and most prosperous of the English Midlands, ranking second in regional gross domestic product to Birmingham. The town's central area, known as Rochdale Wharf, is the central business district, with many of the major shops, offices, and services concentrated on the former site of the former docks and nearby canals. Rochdale also has much of the historic character of the surrounding regions with its grand Victorian architecture and many small villages with many historic stone cottages. The town is also a strong education center, with universities from the University of Huddersfield and University of Manchester within a few miles, several secondary schools, and a large number of private primary schools.\n. There are three main streets converging on the town square. A north to south axis runs from New street ( which leads to the Roman arena and Roman baths ), then passes over the Royal Infirmary, to High street, and then through the town, reaching the town center, at the city water tower. The south to west axis runs from New street through the medieval area of St. Michael\u2019s Church, St. Andrew Church, and St. Paul\u2019s Church, to High street, and then through the town centre, where it intersects the North street axis at a place named \u201d The Exchange \u201d. The third axis, west to east runs from the area of St. Peter\u2019s Old Church to Westgate Square, and down High street, to reach the railway station on the southern end of High street. The railway station is also called \u201cNew Street\u201d. A smaller secondary north-south axis connects the market square to Castle Hill, where the railway station is located ( but the street is not named ). Several other minor roads, side paths, and lanes lead to other parts of the town, including a number of roads running parallel to the town square. The town square is flanked by a number of smaller squares, which are connected by a network of foot paths and lanes. These squares include the market square ( sometimes called the \u201cmain square\u201d ), the old square, and the Roman baths. At the junction of High street and Castle Hill the market square can be reached via two lanes, the larger of which is now used as a footway between the town centre and the new railway station.\nThe town square is the focal point of the town center, with many of the shops and offices concentrated there. Here is the headquarters of the local branch of the Derbyshire Chronicle newspaper. The old market square, which also appears to be centered on the town square, is to the south, with a large market building and an open market area. The Roman baths, which were used in ancient times for medical treatments, are located immediately to the east of the town square. The Roman amphitheater, located at Westgate, has been closed since the early 20th century, but most of the walls are intact and can be seen by foot, with a small entrance off Westgate. The town has many other places of interest to visit, including the Roman Aqueduct, which dates from the time of Julius Caesar.\nThe most widely used format of Rochdale Museum and Art Gallery is the large room with a dome over it and painted ceiling.

She then turned west towards the eastern coast of Africa, and carried out reconnaissance of the area in and around the Cape before sailing to the United States on 7 December 1941. While in port in Los Angeles, California, Eureka was briefly operated by the Navy on 30 January 1942 and was briefly commissioned on 2 February 1942 with Lieutenant Benjamin P. Mahan in command. She was recommissioned on 29 April 1942 with Lieutenant James F. Davenport in commissioning command.  She arrived at New Bedford, Massachusetts on 4 May 1942 and began shakedown training with the Boston Navy Yard, New Bedford. Eureka departed New Bedford on 24 May 1942 for training with the Royal Navy.\nEureka began operations for the United States Navy on 17 July 1942. She steamed for the Middle East on 23 September 1942 carrying staff, equipment, and troops for Operation Torch. After arriving in Alexandria, Egypt, and joining the Task Force (TF) 79, Eureka was detached on 23 September 1942 to escort Task Force (TF) 77 to Alexandria for a refit. After refits at anchor and in Alexandria, Eureka sailed for the Mediterranean Sea on 12 November 1942. In the Mediterranean Sea, Eureka served as the flagship of Task Force 75 of the US Navy until 22 July 1943 when she carried out operations against Axis targets. She carried out operations against Axis targets off the Italian coast in the Adriatic Sea, off the Spanish coast in the Azores and on the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, and in the Adriatic, Aegean Sea, Gulf of Genoa, and Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nTemporary deployment to Europe and Atlantic Ocean operations\n\nShe operated with the US Naval forces fighting Italian and German forces in the Mediterranean and on patrol off the Italian coast in May and June 1943. On 30 July 1943, Eureka, with Admiral William F. Halsey in command, departed Mare Island Portsmouth Island, Virginia on the final Atlantic voyage of her career. She sailed for the Atlantic and served as a member of the escorting force off the coast of the United Kingdom and as a force multiplier during Operation Valiant Shield at Casablanca, Senegal, from 29 August 1944 until 14 September 1944. She was then deployed with Commander James H. Mallory's Task Force 75 to operate against Axis positions around Corsica. Aboard Eureka was Commander Thomas A. Campbell of Task Force 1, 5th Fleet, in charge of providing air cover for Admiral William Halsey's amphibious force when it invaded North Africa in Operation Torch. The task force landed in North Africa at Taranto, Italy on 17 September 1944. From 5 November 1944 until 14 May 1945, Eureka transported troops, planes, and men to and from Naples, Italy and Sicily, Italy, as escorts of troops landing at Italian ports in Operation Market Time on Sicily in November 1941.\nLieutenant Commander (Lt. Commander) Alfred M. Sloan was aboard Eureka's sister ship, USS\u00a0Hatteras, during her deployment off Mediterranean targets until December. She completed a visit to New York City on 16 December 1944, and embarked on 1 February 1945, but was struck by lightning on 23 February 1945 off New York. She arrived in New York on 1 March and cleared New York City on 10 March 1945 for final disposition.\nEureka and her sister ship were scrapped at the York, Maine, shipyard in 1948, and their casks were used for the storage of coal and other commodities until the mid-twentieth century.

{"prompt":"The episode featured an ensemble of family and friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series . William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen 's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper .","text":"The episode featured an ensemble of family and friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Geraint is a retired British army officer who is estranged from his family after a failed political marriage. Mary Cooper, played by Morgan, is Geraint's wife who runs a small cafe in the coastal town of Portsea.\nThe episode featured a group of friends, who also included Tilda Swinton, and who were briefly seen in the first series. They included the playwrights Judi Dench and Jonathan Mostow, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the former Secretary of State for Defence Michael Howard. They also featured two politicians who had previously been close to Gwen and Rhys. They included the Liberal Democrat MP Nick Clegg and the Conservative MP Michael Ashcroft.\nDustin Johnson missed a birdie putt at the 18th hole at the Tour Championship to end his bid to win the major championship. Johnson's putt for par had to be repeated at the par-5 18th due to a flag on the green. Justin Thomas then putted down for an eagle at the par-5 par-4 17th hole and held off Johnson's birdie. Johnson got back on the board by holding the chip and putting through the gap, but after he putted, four other players came through to take the position. A shot later, Patrick Reed putted down for a birdie, with a birdie by Billy Horschel then completing Johnson's three-putt chance. A long ball by Patrick Reed kept Johnson in the hunt to win a Major for his third consecutive season.\nAt the 2019 Tour Championship, Dustin Johnson missed the cut from an expected field of 54 players. The 54th year-old American, who entered the tournament with an 11-over-par 212, shot a 2-wood to the left of the green that forced Johnson to put it back at the black hole of the par-5 18th. Johnson then putted for par. His putt was one of eight in play at the par five, and the two putawheels were tied for eighth as the chip to second was short of the pin after the four players ahead of Johnson put in a birdie putt. In the hole, Johnson was a yard and a half behind the chip which forced the par putt. Johnson had to go again to salvage a playoff.\n\"Obviously the putt was right next to me which is not an ideal situation, but I was playing better at that time if you want to be honest,\" Johnson commented. \"At this stage of the tournament you have to go through these situations. Obviously I put it away and I was disappointed with that par putt, but I was able to get the chip down for the par and I was able to get two putts in a row after my putt and I'm thrilled about that.\"\nJohnson finished second in the Tour Championship, missing out on his first major championship after finishing T4 at the Open Championship a year ago. Johnson was joined in the top five by Thomas (T5), the American Patrick Reed (T6), and the Canadian Justin Rose (T7).\nWith the second place finish, Johnson added a fourth ranking from the tour's European Tour, giving him five wins. While Johnson missed out on the U.S. Open after finishing second in 2018, he did manage to make the 2020 Ryder Cup team.

The original plan for the film was a made - @ in @ - @ TV film. When Trodd decided to direct the film, the studio put him up against < Tom > Myers, who later made < Born to be Wild >. Myers had a previous experience in film by directing the TV drama < The New World >. Myers also worked on < The Big Bang Theory > as a consultant, and in < Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan >, with his production company, he worked with the special effects for the film.\nIt was planned initially to star James Russo opposite < James > Brolin, and they were due to shoot in Hawaii. The film also featured a cameo by < John Candy > who was cast as a local politician with a bad reputation. Russo died just before he was set to do the role. He won the Young Artist Award for his performance, and the American Film Institute listed the film in a list of notable < foreign movie scenes >. When Russo died, the studio replaced him with Kevin Costner. The film was set on the American frontier in the 1930s. The film stars < Matt Damon > as a rancher called Jock McMorrow and < Ben Affleck > as a cowboy sheriff called L. C. Taylor. The film's plot revolves around the clash between the ranchers and the sheriff. There was only one scene filmed in the film that was based on an actual murder story, which involves a woman being shot. However, it was not shown in the film. The film's production company, Miramax Films, had been working with the producer on future projects, both scripted and unscripted, and he offered them < Babe in the woods > as a possibility. The director was in Los Angeles at the time, and he called Brolin to advise him that he thought that the producer wanted < Babe in the woods > filmed. Brolin flew back to New York to see Trodd and he was asked to read the material. It was later cut out of the film.\nThe producers cast < Julie Christie > as one of the ranchers. The production moved to Kansas City, Kansas, to begin. They had a small army of extras to help with the film. The film was shot in a style similar to that of < Hell or High Water >. The production was scheduled to be released in January 2003. After shooting the film for a while Trodd was concerned that the film would not be ready on time. He called his producers who asked him to drop the film altogether and save money. < Babe in the woods > premiered in October 2004 and was the highest grossing film of that year in the United States. The film had a limited release in America, but it performed well. The film was also selected to be shown at < Sundance > festival in January 2005 and in Toronto during the 2005 International Film Festival.\nThe producers were very pleased with the result. < Babe in the woods > was nominated for six < Golden Globe Award > nominations, winning only one, but it won the < Satellite Award > for best original music score. < Babe in the woods > was released on DVD on 30 March 2002.\nThe film featured a special edition that included deleted scenes, alternate and extended cuts, and a featurette entitled < Babe in the woods: The Complete Edit >. The DVD was nominated for a < Primetime Emmy Award > in 2005.

Gibson , a producer on the film , met with","text":"The idea for the film originated from a suggestion by Michael Ferris Gibson, who had made the 2005 documentary 24 Hours on Craigslist. Gibson, a producer on the film, met with the writer James L. Brooks, who is also a producer, and they came up with the concept of a film about a group of people who are looking for a job; they are the protagonists of the movie. Gibson explained that it is a \" very sad story \" on which the film will be based, not to mention that it is one of the most widespread stories in everyday life.\nThe film was set on the streets of Los Angeles where it was filmed, and other places, including bars, garages, and houses. The characters are also set in the bars because they go there to make connections with other characters. In addition to this the movie also focuses on the struggle of all those characters to continue their lives with the job they have found. The cast consists of actors, including: Jack Black as Joe; Billy Bob Thornton as Mark; Dane DeHaan as Peter; Zachary Quinto as Scott; Mark Ruffalo as Ray; and Melissa McCarthy as Katie.\nThe characters of the movie who are striving to find employment each come from different social contexts. For example, Joe is an extremely well-off man from New York City who was unable to work, however, it seems that he's always searching for something different. Mark is a person from Cleveland and he has to be responsible for his wife and two children. Peter is a depressed man who can't seem to find a job, but he wants to move to California in hopes of having a better future. Ray is a woman who can be in the top of Hollywood and she works at a restaurant so she can have what she needs and that might be another job on Craigslist.\nA very important character of the movie is Katie, who has some issues and is still recovering from a relationship that did not work out. She takes pictures and has an online gallery that might help her get to her goals. She is also the one who shows Ray the kind of work she looks for in Los Angeles and they go on together as friends.\nThe film has a very different mood based on how the characters talk among themselves, and it can be perceived that each character has a different view of life than the others. All of them have been through lots of stress and problems during their lives, and they can't seem to get things right. All of them are on a job hunt and they have to face different obstacles, such as being discriminated against or not having an idea that they can be successful in that field, they have to face all of this to get a new job.\nThe first half of the movie has some scenes with the characters speaking about their lives as if they were being filmed by the camera. Meanwhile, the last part of the film was filmed in a way that it gave the viewer an unforeseen view of the movie world and the job hunt. The first and last part of the movie are very different from the other scenes in the film; the director was able to show the audience that a change in the protagonist's perspective is very relevant in this film.\n\nReception\n\nThe film has a very positive feedback on the Internet, thus proving that many people are satisfied with the results of the movie itself. People are also very passionate on the different roles that the actors play. For example, the fact that the movie shows the struggles and problems that the young adults might have to overcome in their lives.\nThe film was very well received by the audience in the United States where the film received $37 million over its opening weekend, with an average of $9,620 per theatre.

{"prompt":"The Court agreed with Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had original title to Pedra Branca , rejecting Singapore 's argument that the island was terra nullius . It found it was not disputed that Johor","text":"The Court agreed with Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had original title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's argument that the island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor's title did not extend to Pulau Langkawi in the Straits of Johor and that the Sultan had taken no steps to extend it.\nThe Court's decision in the case is a landmark decision, as it recognised Sultan Ibrahim's right to Pedra Branca, in violation of the ruling in Laut Case. The ruling upholds Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.\nIn his dissenting judgment Justice Thakkar expressed doubts about the propriety of the ruling. Thakkar, who was appointed Justice of the Court in 2009, argued that the court should not have been given the power to determine ownership, but should have addressed the problems that arose, like the dispute about ownership and marine boundaries, directly and amicably.\nThe case was heard in front of Justice Thakkar. The proceedings were held in January 2015 by Justices Raymond Bhaskaran and Shashi Tharoor.\nIn July 2016, a statement was released by the Indonesian Government detailing that it is considering bringing a declaration of sovereignty over Pulau Langkawi in the South China Sea before the International Court of Justice, if other parties to the dispute failed to cooperate in this regard.\nIn September 2016, after being given at least 60 working days to file its case, South Korea was reported to have begun its own preliminary application to the ICJ to determine the ownership of the islands in the South China Sea.\nThe application would be filed in May 2017 before the Court, and will aim to establish how the islands were legally settled by diplomatic actions, as well as to see if they were included in the \"nullius\" status.\nOn 16 January 2018, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the Indonesian islands of Pulau Pattle and Pulau Pari are part of the Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Disputes region between Indonesia and Malaysia.\nIn June 2018, Malaysia announced that it has filed an application to the International Court of Justice in which it claims ownership of an area in Singapore waters, including a large swath of land in Pedra Branca.\nIn December 2019, Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte visited the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, where he was met by Malaysia's premier, Mahathir Mohamad. The meeting took place in the presence of Filipino foreign ministry's Permanent Secretary Albert del Rosario.\nOn 14 December 2019, in a press conference on the sidelines of the conference, Malaysia said, \" It was agreed that Malaysia would file one application [with reference to the United States, Russia, the Philippines and Taiwan] and another [without reference to any particular country] at the Permanent Court of Arbitration to clarify the maritime boundary. \" It added that other legal arguments that are discussed will be resolved through other avenues. Malaysian foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah said that his country has always maintained diplomatic relations with Singapore in the island.\nOn the same day, Philippines foreign minister Teodoro Locsin Jr. said it is imperative that Philippine foreign minister Teodoro Locsin Jr. holds a press conference to discuss the issue of Pedra Branca and the Philippines. Locsin Jr. said he would not go to the press conference if the United States is included in the list of countries and said that it is not the Philippines' interest to continue \"with such a confrontation. \" Locsin later refused to attend the press conference.\nOn 31 January 2020, Malaysia confirmed that former president Mahathir Mohamad has made the decision to launch legal proceedings

{"prompt":"The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason \u2014 and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness ( mad people can","text":"The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason \u2014 and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness ( mad people can travel to other worlds, and can influence and shape those worlds \u2026 a parallel with reality \u2026) that will be the focus \u2014 and the storylines of both worlds are interrelated too, although to a different extent.\nI have chosen the book because, although I have never read it, the film (based on the short story) I saw made me love the book. The book\u2019s title has been translated as The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, but I have decided not to use the translation, because it seems to be very similar to the translation of the book I am planning to translate later.\nThat is, I chose the book I read a long time ago because The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was part of my childhood, and it was one of the books for which I had a longing for books that were not the ones I read myself, or at least, books that I did not read in a certain order.\nAnd I have chosen the book because the protagonists of the story are also those of the story about which I will write.\nSo I will talk about the same protagonists: a boy called Tanjiro, who is not the typical knight, brave warrior and adventurer. This is a young boy who loves a little girl called Nezuko.\nAnd I will talk about a character that I remember clearly from the anime: the older sister of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, who is known as \u201cThe Ghost Slayer\u201d, and her pet tiger known as \u201cThe Phantom\u201d.\nI have a lot to say about these characters, not only because they\u2019re ones that always intrigue me, but also because I plan to tell the story of their journey, the ways they change throughout it, the sacrifices this adventure entails, and also because they really are an interesting topic to analyse \u2014 at least for my purposes \u2014 in the context of a fictional saga about a boy and a girl.\nAll this led me to choose the book for this project (as I have explained before, I always choose books that involve me closely), but I am also curious to know how readers view this work. Will you like it?\nYes, you can use the book in this project, and this project is open to contributions. If you still have any doubts, I have explained how you can contribute to it on this blog.\nThanks a lot for all your support. We have had a crazy ride recently and have had to delay things like the release of Witch\u2019s Heart. However we can finally finally share a few of the pages with you at last. We are really excited to share a few more pages so stay tuned\u2026 \ud83d\ude42\nA very beautiful, moving tale! And a great way to end the year, with this release on top.. Happy New Year!\nBeautifully, yet morbidly illustrating the conflict between good and evil, madness and rationality, in an old fairytale. Lovely work!\nThank you for the support and the support that we have received from many many people during the months ahead! It has been a very, very exciting last year and a year to remember! \ud83d\ude42\nI loved the story! It also inspired me quite a lot for \u2018My Lady\u2019 at Falling Skies as the protagonist, the main man (you know the one) is Nezuko\u2019s brother. Maybe we should link up for our Christmas lists \ud83d\ude42\nI think she will agree, especially after reading her blog on the topic. \ud83d\ude42 She is very curious about the story we are writing.

{"prompt":"Missoula has four main sources of print media : the Missoulian ( primary daily ) , Missoula Independent ( alternative weekly ) , Montana < unk > ( college ) , and New West (","text":"Missoula has four main sources of print media : the Missoulian ( primary daily ), Missoula Independent ( alternative weekly ), Montana < unk > ( college ), and New West ( print trade paper ) The Missoulian, the most important newspaper here, is the official spokesman for the Missoula city government. A recent staff writer reported in the New York Times that the newspaper's newsroom was as large as an English country squa, d. The New West, another print trade paper, specializes in stories around the Missoula region.\nThe radio stations in Missoula are WBMX-Missoula, 93. 5 FM with a studios and transmitter on the campus of Missoula's H. W. Marriot College, and WDMX-House on the campus of the Montana State University., Both are \" non-commercial \" and the station managers have no advertising dollars to spend. The stations employ two announcers, two reporters, and two technicians on a salary of $8,300 per year for a total of $37,400, roughly one-third of what an average station employs in New York City.\nA radio producer of a \" commercial \" station in New York makes $48, 300 per year. In San Francisco, a radio station has a salary of $50, 100 per year. A number of radio stations in New York are a part of an entertainment syndicate which has annual revenues of $11 million, while a San Francisco station is part of a syndicate with annual revenues of $8. 5 million. Radio stations in San Francisco are paid in advance and operate at a loss, their revenues being in part raised from advertising time.\nIn California and New York, stations broadcast through frequency modulation, with their radio programs being monitored continuously. They have to be constantly on the air, or if they fail to get new programs they have to shut down. In Montana, where radio was introduced recently, an individual is required to have approval of the FCC before he can turn on the radio transmitter. The FCC now has about 80 licensed FM transmitters.\nRadio stations, both commercial and non-commercial, are the only ones that have regular programs for weekend users. The only daily programs available are in New York and San Francisco. The programs in New York are produced over a weekend in a separate studio and broadcast on weekdays. The programs in San Francisco are broadcast from the Radio Center on Channel 7 of the city public t. v. system. The programs are produced in two days, with a mix going on air on Friday morning. A station in New York does not have programming prepared in advance on weekdays. The entire week's program is prepared on Saturday night and on Sunday night. Some of the programs are changed on the air for one day only. In New York and San Francisco, some of the programs are syndicated from other stations. In Montana, the station managers' schedules on weekdays are not published, so a user who would like to hear a program on a particular day can only use it by listening to the station during the week.\nMost of the local newspapers are published in the city of Missoula, although the Missoulian publishes a weekly newsweek in New York City, Missoula Independent publishes the weekly New M ountain in San Francisco, and Montana News publishes the weekly New West. Also, several of the cities and towns have a weekly newspaper. New Haven has an independent weekly published by a church group.\nMost of the city and town newspapers are small, with a circulation much less than a newspaper in New York. One of the most noticeable differences between San Francisco and New York is that New York has over ten times as many newspapers; California has just a little more than 3,000. New York has nearly seven times as many daily newspapers as California; California has over four times as many.","token_len":791,"entropy":[9.085,0.6112,4.4907,6.1619,6.1693,4.4385,0.1392,13.3031,1.9548,7.8452,2.6822,9.183,0.0115,4.4757,3.4848,11.1923,5.8067,1.605,5.2238,0.0852,3.1709,5.3333,0.3718,6.5216,0.9743,0.603,7.2599,10.5732,9.957,5.6366,5.3027,1.0564,7.7387,2.9897,0.8358,5.8103,7.1429,0.8001,6.3056,7.0568,2.824,3.1636,4.407,2.8019,0.0042,0.0357,3.536,2.3981,4.0178,2.8121,2.2493,6.6325,0.4992,1.3312,2.2399,4.288,6.4285,0.4052,0.4813,3.5702,0.0073,3.5111,5.3454,0.9304,0.6679,4.5076,5.2001,8.3927,5.4787,4.6472,3.4536,1.1944,4.6491,1.6138,0.2369,0.4014,1.1109,2.6126,2.0705,4.4043,0.6193,2.2565,6.2029,3.6538,0.1309,3.8943,4.9475,7.984,12.0799,9.6609,5.6579,9.142,5.4053,2.8091,4.0747,3.0858,1.63,4.616,5.2646,0.948,0.1228,0.2541,6.9366,0.0334,5.53,7.1618,1.121,6.009,0.0028,0.2193,2.3094,0.7672,2.8005,5.1381,7.394,3.1648,2.3224,2.1136,0.0007,0.0041,1.431,6.6737,6.6805,2.1131,2.3918,7.9045,0.0171,0.2315,1.2167,6.6916,0.3155,7.1527,3.9766,5.8355,2.0906,11.2001,2.3202,8.7188,4.173,1.3418,5.3435,1.017,3.1847,0.0084,0.0101,3.4722,6.3171,3.6271,4.505,0.072,7.551,5.7645,1.3542,1.147,1.0622,2.3036,5.2819,0.9035,0.2448,11.465,3.1794,0.6192,1.5575,0.0257,1.6814,5.7369,0.6133,0.0864,10.4085,6.979,2.7844,6.3716,11.0456,0.3634,1.3846,1.2477,1.8195,4.4267,2.7705,7.9863,2.6388,1.4371,5.4992,6.1457,2.5692,2.0223,1.0574,1.659,3.2328,5.5549,4.1278,7.4891,0.0012,1.3114,3.6866,2.5148,0.4398,0.666,1.7974,5.195,4.3193,2.2281,6.2863,0.2915,0.5282,3.9727,0.9284,3.9121,1.6156,0.9024,3.9442,1.9232,2.0699,0.4421,0.5204,5.4933,0.0407,3.28,3.2037,6.9046,3.8546,0.5072,0.5971,0.3358,2.4324,4.6598,1.3414,3.6239,6.0766,1.7586,3.4843,0.7342,0.4636,0.3206,1.4072,4.2615,3.8856,7.5588,4.6139,3.2406,4.4159,6.542,1.0499,0.7247,2.4643,2.8395,0.1417,6.3401,1.2993,5.3816,0.1319,10.0314,1.0541,0.2742,1.404,3.0,5.5112,0.3864,0.3888,2.2745,1.1681,1.4596,4.1992,1.1933,3.3227,0.0818,0.1444,3.4971,0.0138,6.0085,0.1588,0.0357,0.6545,3.0377,5.6123,0.0222,1.6727,0.4309,1.4445,1.8751,0.1362,3.1315,5.5536,3.2006,0.0747,3.9827,5.5959,5.6406,0.114,4.0995,2.2101,6.2077,1.2237,0.2717,0.7022,4.5432,0.8464,1.5154,3.9402,2.2916,8.0787,0.0544,1.4617,2.5698,3.6147,0.0163,0.6261,2.7727,0.072,2.7143,1.0074,0.2531,0.105,0.1979,3.4337,2.0515,8.3318,1.3405,0.3452,4.1287,0.713,0.8537,2.7276,0.0587,1.5982,4.0698,3.7542,3.7963,2.0646,5.713,2.8328,1.229,4.1686,2.1006,6.1416,2.7178,2.8784,4.7162,3.5195,5.6136,3.1388,2.1409,8.1999,1.0497,1.1376,2.6185,4.6964,3.5086,1.3469,0.2454,0.2859,4.1797,5.3671,5.0045,9.5911,6.5453,2.7368,4.8149,3.8209,4.1633,4.9757,2.2169,6.4762,5.643,1.5387,3.9768,2.6612,4.2707,1.9474,6.1099,3.3955,0.8023,0.4481,1.3795,3.521,5.5508,0.7633,4.5565,0.7587,3.495,6.383,5.4965,2.2789,2.9198,0.1266,3.5118,0.3297,1.1267,1.8887,4.3144,0.3098,4.5975,2.0862,4.7493,3.5576,7.0756,0.4021,4.7583,4.9605,3.3323,1.1843,0.0919,2.5136,6.5071,3.2697,0.8461,3.402,1.8728,3.012,0.703,8.2497,0.8673,1.0581,0.6447,5.1032,0.6479,2.0753,1.9017,5.4086,2.0892,5.4301,4.5682,5.5067,5.4612,4.547,0.0002,2.771,1.2276,2.1066,0.7625,4.0327,4.6394,1.9624,0.0472,1.1481,0.0494,0.0106,0.1107,1.4325,4.5624,2.4728,2.4191,1.6251,2.268,6.4614,5.3488,3.7115,10.1173,9.243,0.7524,2.098,3.1586,7.7243,2.759,3.3821,0.5987,4.3256,4.4917,0.1545,1.4876,1.1118,0.0091,0.6482,2.0678,5.4623,3.6793,1.7295,0.0329,0.9818,5.8574,5.9301,1.7668,6.1092,3.7857,2.7424,4.8028,1.8722,2.4416,1.9383,1.7409,5.5813,0.0351,0.992,1.6643,3.2932,0.9423,0.9115,0.0014,0.3761,3.2048,3.6608,1.6204,4.6487,3.6515,2.6506,9.1433,3.398,2.7507,0.6797,4.7118,7.909,13.4829,2.7229,7.6123,0.4713,9.0572,0.8842,1.7824,3.1516,1.6302,3.1277,2.026,3.1265,3.4997,1.293,2.4873,2.1735,5.0136,8.9079,1.0899,8.4509,2.159,3.7345,4.3646,2.4982,4.2133,3.9499,2.5447,1.5746,0.0595,4.1902,0.3015,0.8839,4.75,10.2008,3.0697,0.192,5.7448,3.2556,0.0127,0.7077,1.9502,6.1564,3.7469,2.7838,1.8265,0.7103,6.2801,2.1217,4.0092,3.7787,2.3523,2.4338,0.8993,2.2242,0.4583,5.1061,1.4566,0.1682,1.6082,1.2035,8.0562,2.5554,1.8641,3.2967,3.4041,4.8825,2.187,1.7008,1.0642,3.0213,1.5703,0.0527,2.89,1.2194,0.0017,0.2781,4.3647,1.1567,0.0954,1.5325,0.5016,6.2958,0.0124,3.8168,4.5281,0.4902,1.2115,2.3953,1.0126,0.2095,1.6108,2.5271,3.2843,5.0936,3.6287,5.5937,2.2887,0.017,0.8318,2.9835,5.0691,2.0579,2.34,3.9627,6.7781,2.6067,4.9169,0.81,0.1892,3.7215,2.0384,1.1853,2.1187,2.2916,4.2353,0.9143,1.5857,2.3559,4.2527,4.7577,4.0724,4.7925,0.4305,0.9828,1.9131,5.2167,0.8421,1.2395,0.7831,0.9055,4.8434,1.2295,0.1818,3.868,5.3423,2.1194,5.3214,0.9225,1.5058,3.6077,1.7947,0.485,0.0009,0.0007,1.0771,3.5496,2.1031,2.8318,0.0016,0.8955,3.775,2.8657,2.6114,3.3383,5.647,1.8731,3.1629,0.0411,0.8848,1.9069,4.2209,0.0122,0.0026,1.8602,5.3495,2.7954,2.6398,4.6394,8.5144,9.9839,7.53,8.508,4.0862,2.6294,0.0441,0.4471,0.4705,2.5925,3.6168,1.1069,0.7319,0.7039,2.9187,1.6063,1.6797,6.1137,0.6332,4.4837,2.2022,0.1281,6.129,3.3899,0.5099,3.334,2.4709,3.9078,1.7961,2.2728,4.6015,7.1008,2.5694,3.0369,3.4005,2.9325,6.6349,2.7275,1.9351,9.0877,3.3049,1.9307,1.4531,4.6544,0.5919,0.1341,4.7167,3.8496,1.9779,0.9413,0.905

W. O'Keefe is intended to be only to provide links to the Wiki\nThe Oligocene was a geologically important era for the Earth\u2019s history, for it is the period of time from around 33.7 mya (miles since Yule) to 2.1 mya. Prior to the Oligocene, Earth\u2019s land surface was dominated by forests that varied in size dependent upon latitude and elevation. As climate started to become colder and drier, forests were supplanted by grasslands, some of which later gave origin to the first grasses. However, as vegetation was altered, this had an impact on atmospheric dynamics. Winds had to contend with more surfaces of exposed sand and soil grains. Also, as the amount of vegetation became relatively smaller, the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases was diminished. The result was larger and stronger westerly and north easterly winds. These winds had a dramatic impact on surface climate, allowing these wind directions to have a major influence on how vegetation was distributed around the world, including on land masses such as Madagascar and Australia. The result of these changes allowed these regions to become desert, and this allowed the land masses to become completely bare of vegetation. The increased amount of dust, which can be a health risk, also gave rise to increased amounts of particulate matter in the atmosphere - in particular particles of iron - that, despite being toxic, allowed for the development of larger amounts of atmospheric iron in these regions during this time.\nWhile this period was generally characterized by much more arid climates than have previously occurred in the Earth\u2019s geological history, some areas were significantly wetter. It is believed that this was due to significant volcanic activity. It is a well documented fact that there is a direct correlation between increased volcanic activity and an increase in rainfall. The increased volcanic activity occurred mostly in the west, and this allows for areas such as eastern India, the central American Isthmus, Central and South America\u2019s Great Amazon River System, and North America\u2019s Great Lakes to have received more rainfall due to the increased volcanic activity. The western volcanic activity also occurred during this time period but was more sporadic, such that these regions did not experience increased rainfall due to volcanic activity. The eastern volcanic activity was much more powerful and long-lasting, and allowed for some areas that were relatively drier to become wetter.\nAdditionally, it is believed that there was a large decrease in atmospheric pressure near the equator. This pressure decrease led to increased temperatures near the equator, and the increase in temperatures brought about much more arid conditions in these areas. The increased aridity allowed areas that had previously been wet to become desert, and this increased aridity also affected the Great Plains of North America which were already relatively arid.\nIt is hard to say exactly what climate was experienced around the globe during this time period, but the general idea is that it was a cooler climate than that experienced up to this point on Earth\u2019s history. There is some evidence in some regions that it was warmer, but that does not necessarily apply to the entire globe.\nAt the beginning of the Oligocene, temperatures on Earth were close to what they will be in the second half of the 21th century, and it is estimated that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were slightly warmer than those for the middle of the 19th century.","token_len":792,"entropy":[11.7698,2.7528,6.7377,3.5433,13.5773,6.5785,4.3236,0.959,10.3123,9.1072,8.7538,1.7486,7.5956,4.5794,2.1242,5.7911,2.6817,8.5709,6.6559,1.8656,6.0196,2.0161,7.1827,12.4765,0.7495,9.0818,0.1164,4.5651,2.276,4.4966,6.186,3.5207,3.5552,0.048,8.1289,2.0464,5.8333,2.1112,3.2396,2.3129,1.2754,5.1892,6.7927,0.1588,5.9595,5.4871,0.409,3.6265,5.139,0.228,0.048,1.4531,0.0066,0.0019,0.1779,0.6682,0.0238,0.3952,0.1369,0.0042,0.004,0.0014,0.0047,0.0298,0.0734,0.3408,0.4003,0.0036,0.098,0.0002,0.0066,0.0188,6.0725,0.0517,0.1387,0.0988,0.0044,0.0019,0.0025,0.0009,0.0008,0.0074,2.3936,5.1581,5.4906,1.5667,2.0232,8.6708,11.27,3.1043,5.129,3.2005,7.1056,3.2668,0.9037,6.3,2.4881,4.0182,0.0899,5.4077,0.7276,4.2205,5.0957,9.3487,0.6173,0.4187,7.0323,6.2844,3.6224,3.5354,0.4207,1.8867,6.033,5.4387,2.2276,7.2431,6.8375,2.8915,5.7628,0.958,5.9476,2.6638,3.0297,4.8312,2.6888,1.349,4.2304,10.9244,7.4469,7.182,2.9245,1.4992,4.3919,2.0775,2.2737,1.3564,3.5668,1.4475,2.7143,2.6158,3.9844,6.1713,2.632,2.4007,11.4779,1.1786,2.7281,6.2771,5.3504,7.9258,9.3083,3.6954,0.8112,1.285,4.2161,0.1508,3.1248,1.322,0.0051,3.9785,6.9296,0.039,1.4887,2.3376,0.0012,0.0011,0.595,3.044,3.6402,0.0765,0.0369,4.0019,2.9615,0.6919,3.6125,0.0337,6.3503,3.7606,5.6721,0.7173,0.9592,10.0917,1.7977,5.4068,1.0592,2.9684,0.6343,3.685,5.139,6.2734,0.2126,4.9751,4.0266,1.2573,2.2576,0.0001,0.3793,3.0538,2.6482,7.1408,0.1029,0.0994,4.1559,0.709,1.39,5.9048,0.8495,0.1006,6.5827,5.7218,11.4281,0.0488,1.2007,5.3115,6.4464,3.4882,1.309,4.6166,0.0652,2.7421,3.7937,3.41,7.1972,1.6381,4.2481,5.571,2.4536,1.0648,0.1456,5.417,5.0804,1.3306,8.4291,5.0224,0.596,6.7604,0.0258,4.7601,9.6649,3.5099,7.3204,5.2258,1.4219,3.6905,9.1285,1.9546,5.5194,0.3383,2.398,1.3584,5.0292,0.0245,3.0489,3.2002,6.9526,2.8817,0.3629,1.3565,2.961,0.0171,4.4441,0.7556,3.0166,0.6573,1.3019,0.0716,2.512,4.7719,0.5365,1.9728,4.9654,0.2615,8.5933,1.9535,4.018,7.1744,0.6352,0.1973,5.8695,5.9325,7.0753,0.0063,0.0167,0.2964,1.8838,3.5442,1.2244,3.332,1.479,4.0361,1.3435,0.0538,5.1869,2.9024,1.3786,5.2417,6.3176,4.0511,5.9205,0.0635,4.3911,0.9999,3.552,1.2857,0.0591,4.1017,4.2709,1.871,2.9572,4.7397,0.2128,2.6697,2.938,3.6864,2.7949,2.2582,6.5861,3.5494,0.0015,10.0116,1.2913,3.3816,0.32,1.907,4.4464,1.9053,1.2363,1.6082,7.2017,5.069,5.3944,0.1502,1.5567,7.9508,2.7892,2.3449,3.2655,4.2336,1.4333,3.2582,0.9612,0.1664,1.1994,7.1462,6.1204,3.4072,0.6043,0.6964,1.8031,6.1046,3.3409,0.0084,4.4514,2.2433,3.0628,5.0001,1.1602,3.7714,7.5494,2.065,1.4563,2.0992,4.1746,0.7904,0.0029,3.761,4.2701,0.0035,5.6044,0.2862,0.0281,2.5998,0.4484,1.4841,6.2538,4.6999,1.7649,4.7467,0.9421,3.9731,4.8345,2.2234,4.9534,5.5991,0.688,5.934,0.8204,5.7545,2.401,1.8007,3.0039,0.0164,7.5692,4.1096,0.0086,4.477,4.5396,2.2478,4.4965,1.2737,4.8448,1.7815,0.7825,0.3678,2.3594,5.7941,3.0216,4.6195,1.3073,5.1413,1.963,0.4235,5.336,2.7958,4.1429,0.3725,2.6519,1.8995,8.0005,3.7092,6.3201,1.4744,0.7049,2.2217,1.5531,0.0149,0.0871,3.367,0.2979,0.1158,3.5026,2.9883,1.7871,5.4696,3.6405,0.0045,2.5271,4.3988,0.9269,2.8457,0.1264,2.1161,1.6912,0.721,0.1129,6.5656,5.3478,0.0823,2.3868,3.4901,0.469,5.3547,4.1881,1.8278,0.3184,0.0535,3.8923,2.247,1.1975,4.5755,0.6264,0.0434,4.7321,2.8182,0.02,0.3284,3.8505,0.4673,0.0295,3.0702,1.286,2.0254,4.9015,3.6357,0.0315,4.1813,4.6921,1.1222,0.9792,5.0305,1.061,1.8237,3.3326,8.403,0.7081,6.5879,2.7401,0.0017,6.3746,3.7272,1.5403,2.4459,4.7575,5.184,7.0989,1.2434,0.0,0.5796,4.649,1.5277,0.4345,0.0608,7.3576,0.0287,0.0204,4.7067,6.1935,4.4907,4.4317,0.4546,0.6366,4.9863,0.5083,1.0854,0.0032,0.1011,2.7271,1.8694,1.3722,1.7418,5.7356,1.5386,0.8557,3.8844,0.005,1.3954,1.3891,2.1249,0.0071,0.3432,2.0309,5.9828,9.8852,1.3365,2.5168,1.8413,2.3763,0.718,0.6003,1.6239,5.4912,2.0215,2.9344,4.706,1.5954,5.9283,2.3102,4.2418,1.9538,2.7782,0.1023,1.4204,5.4475,1.6675,1.7645,0.0106,3.1638,0.0289,0.2336,1.9762,4.3972,2.5987,0.0693,1.4032,3.9952,0.5869,6.2469,1.6143,6.1355,1.7705,0.2444,1.0545,1.6007,5.5837,0.2126,4.1328,2.0763,4.5309,1.2478,3.7097,3.2403,0.0016,1.5066,2.6012,1.4101,0.0219,0.8622,1.4367,6.8017,0.0438,3.3811,0.3893,0.7595,0.0344,2.9059,0.9888,0.6643,3.452,4.2788,0.0409,3.5523,3.1049,6.8651,0.4922,2.5275,0.0092,2.2726,0.7702,3.8137,4.083,3.2772,0.0358,2.6276,3.6074,4.9435,0.1836,0.511,0.0237,1.128,1.4172,2.6288,2.5838,0.1427,3.5401,6.1638,0.8404,5.25,2.188,4.0994,0.6004,1.3248,2.1733,2.0076,1.1343,0.4395,1.8446,2.9212,3.0579,0.3409,3.8545,5.8614,3.7903,1.24,2.1767,0.5092,2.1016,2.4632,0.5686,6.1721,1.2233,0.6728,0.9174,3.6234,2.7312,0.0335,2.3055,4.6635,0.93,8.3795,2.4746,3.1733,1.4534,0.174,4.7937,2.8898,3.9458,4.5762,3.1524,0.0024,0.6747,1.3538,3.848,0.3244,7.4023,0.025,2.096,2.6766,1.0667,5.7049,2.5257,4.9857,5.5991,0.5266,4.0267,0.8596,0.6361,0.4417,0.1803,0.5842,0.5989,2.1328,4.508,2.3664,0.5396,0.0775,2.584,0.3606,2.0305,5.664,2.2407,1.1427,3.4115,1.2617,7.3781,0.9902,2.8548,0.9803,5.2186,0.4222,2.5625,0.0064,0.1442,4.5609,0.3746,3.7225,1.5803,2.4037,0.627,4.4734,2.9852,3.9655,

{"prompt":"Canada as a nation is religiously diverse , encompassing a wide range of groups , beliefs and customs . The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references `` God `` , and","text":"Canada as a nation is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of groups, beliefs and customs. The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references `` God ``, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Article II guarantees free practice of religion by all ( section 19, Charter of Rights and Freedoms Act, as follows: ).. These rights include freedom to practise any religion or belief ; freedom not to practise any religion or belief ; to choose religion or belief ; to change religion or belief ; to publicly declare one's religion or belief ; to use public buildings for worship ; to have and use religious symbols ; to have religious objects ; to have a place of worship; to hold services; to proselytise; to administer religious rites ; to teach; to practise; to form religious congregations, societies and associations; to administer religious institutions; to practise religious rites, ceremonies and observances; to publicly administer religious instruction and to do everything else necessary to enable Canadians to live as Christians).\nThere have been three previous governments that have supported religious freedom in Canada. The two premiers were John Diefenbaker, and in his first term. Mr. Diefenbaker was opposed to church-state separation but supported religious freedom by allowing the use of public buildings for religious functions, by providing for the protection of churches and religious houses against destruction.\nThe federal government under the Canadian conservative government of Mr. Jim Callaghan was a very strong supporter of religious freedom. During his term, the Conservative government passed the Canadian Religious Freedom Act, which guarantees freedom of religion but also prohibits discrimination upon religious grounds as defined by law ( section 6).\nWhen the former Prime Minister Paul Martin took office as president of the Liberal party in 1998, he maintained religious freedom as a priority. In February, Martin announced that the Liberal party would support a bill that would remove the `` unreasonable impediments '' on religious freedom in Canada. In a press conference in December, Martin explained that he would support `` religious freedom for all Canadians and respect for conscience, the sanctity of conscience, religious faith, individual conscience, and individual beliefs. ''\nIn the 2011 federal election, the Conservative party ran a platform that called for repeal of the Canadian Religious Freedom Act. They also proposed that churches be listed as charitable trusts, as had the social security program, and all other programs of the State, as well as abolishing taxes on religious activities (section 6 of the Charter Act ). However, the Conservatives' political platform, as well as the party's response to the 2011 Bills, was quickly criticized by the opposition party, New Democrats. The Conservative Party stated that in its future it would consider revising the Bills, which were adopted by parliament in 2011, but not as a means to eliminate any taxes from churches.\nIn 2010, the province of Quebec passed Bill 70 to address religious freedom. The new law provides that schools are not required to support the school's religious tradition and the government of the province has provided funding for schools with independent schools for the same purpose. The law requires schools to provide instruction in a language other than French. Bill 70 was passed in the Senate and had to cross a motion of no confidence in the government of Canada. In March 2011, Bill 70 received royal assent and becomes part of the legal code of Quebec. The bill has received a mixed reception in Quebec. Some Quebecers consider it as a violation of their freedom of religion and other minority groups consider it as a restriction of the right of free expression.\nIn 1993, in a speech to the Toronto Bar Assoc. on '' Freedom of Religion '', Edward Felsenthal, a judge of the United States Supreme Court, stated that religious freedom in Canada was a matter of constitutional law, and that it was compatible with the U.S. legal system. A later speech given by Thomas Reed of the Harvard Law School reiterated the same opinion.","token_len":793,"entropy":[5.4306,1.2001,4.115,3.3826,11.832,3.5404,1.0616,7.4042,0.0052,2.128,1.5777,0.5035,0.0183,5.427,1.1933,4.1924,0.6091,4.756,0.728,2.4291,8.0683,3.0446,0.0014,0.8067,0.475,6.3001,0.9867,0.2691,0.0674,0.0167,0.0027,0.0,7.8308,11.1213,13.8272,7.888,1.8974,1.7232,1.7036,3.4593,1.5686,0.1099,0.2562,0.0169,0.1775,0.0003,7.7476,2.77,5.8232,5.4542,7.2321,0.5829,0.2689,4.8888,0.5058,6.0329,11.4835,4.6304,4.076,5.6582,0.8224,0.0616,0.0761,0.0005,0.0002,6.7146,1.6581,8.5825,10.2904,0.5467,7.3286,7.968,6.3491,1.1741,2.4569,1.5228,2.0958,1.7432,4.0714,0.2645,2.6208,0.6683,8.5668,1.3147,3.8861,0.1358,2.8555,0.9413,0.2515,0.4443,0.0731,1.4819,5.476,5.6956,2.324,0.8402,0.2295,1.286,0.8394,5.3008,0.7033,0.1743,0.0346,0.454,0.4503,6.4595,3.4987,3.7097,0.1762,0.7872,0.4226,0.1674,0.466,0.4268,4.5613,3.2004,3.5018,2.7673,2.1847,1.2525,0.3201,4.3345,4.5137,3.3522,2.7832,1.1491,1.311,0.3611,2.7874,2.2618,6.1339,1.5499,0.2972,2.3293,2.8787,2.8753,0.51,0.109,3.7753,0.3291,3.5664,5.6483,3.5504,0.1919,7.8037,0.0012,0.0137,0.5447,1.5513,0.1469,6.4702,2.0858,2.7314,1.6243,0.2071,3.8208,2.8045,0.1479,4.1876,3.3029,0.1778,6.2215,2.0368,3.6085,0.0036,2.4772,3.1235,1.214,2.3596,1.8151,0.3283,4.1215,1.1553,5.3819,1.8431,0.2434,4.4012,1.144,1.2531,2.4096,2.7162,0.4529,3.873,0.0057,1.8288,0.2953,5.8278,5.1963,0.5171,7.519,1.1538,2.4604,5.7319,6.7474,3.7797,2.1812,0.8298,3.9932,7.9862,0.1146,3.2042,3.5377,2.7212,8.0309,1.209,9.2705,3.7292,0.1553,4.4326,5.2038,4.674,1.4905,0.4867,5.5496,2.0031,0.6162,1.7644,0.5439,0.951,1.2342,5.1287,5.2679,0.012,4.2017,4.4507,1.3472,0.0041,0.0069,0.0238,0.0001,2.8141,3.2265,5.1717,3.3752,2.1313,0.7536,6.7663,4.5283,0.356,0.5492,0.0045,0.0054,0.0085,0.0009,1.9813,4.2277,0.1834,5.4994,1.646,0.5394,0.2316,3.2139,2.8042,2.1988,0.4193,4.1556,4.7333,2.2541,3.7686,0.0393,1.3694,0.2247,0.9678,1.4062,5.524,1.8729,5.465,3.2249,1.3055,1.1713,4.3265,0.0577,4.4368,1.133,2.5398,6.61,4.5047,6.008,4.3428,2.108,1.4986,4.2845,0.3855,6.1128,1.9053,4.0988,10.3607,1.102,1.1017,2.6109,0.0009,6.2137,9.5804,0.3077,2.2043,2.766,4.3226,2.4257,0.8891,0.0215,0.6732,0.1462,0.8426,4.1724,1.6296,2.5152,1.4178,1.6855,3.6395,0.1915,3.4984,1.4288,3.6749,1.1394,0.4988,0.1992,1.5129,0.7334,5.3442,1.6194,0.4162,0.8099,4.5511,2.4635,2.7259,0.9603,6.7648,2.9683,0.3884,5.2429,2.7227,0.9026,3.1086,2.8601,2.5044,3.5664,3.25,1.6685,5.2083,1.2584,6.0125,3.2892,0.0056,4.4635,0.0425,2.988,0.3844,3.2089,4.9367,0.9575,0.251,3.8294,1.7621,0.7677,4.087,0.2194,0.9678,6.6961,3.7826,0.202,2.8416,0.8857,4.4702,0.9149,2.2872,5.1661,3.379,6.4861,2.631,0.8418,1.8555,2.6453,1.7874,0.3164,2.4524,2.0378,2.1995,1.4498,0.1585,5.3043,1.2325,8.3055,11.8282,3.8527,1.0603,5.0462,3.8449,0.7184,0.7518,2.3511,0.8006,0.9462,2.7236,3.0277,3.0738,1.4852,1.8993,3.8175,1.0314,0.8786,4.9379,0.5395,1.4546,2.2096,2.1325,4.4326,6.0009,0.4833,2.7741,1.0613,0.6686,2.5843,5.9343,1.8314,4.537,2.3689,3.3518,3.6284,0.0065,0.1232,3.9619,0.678,3.7954,4.8899,0.7671,4.9994,3.1831,0.549,1.2459,3.8147,5.0533,2.8932,2.3135,1.0747,2.3704,2.5314,5.2462,1.9183,0.1515,0.8388,1.3897,2.2806,1.6046,4.1503,0.7869,3.8433,0.5527,2.5398,0.1487,7.3771,0.0555,0.6283,3.7318,1.5471,0.0303,0.0314,0.9865,5.7242,2.6263,3.1179,1.7973,4.78,2.0829,6.8683,0.3968,5.0637,3.9897,1.8888,3.3772,7.7533,2.6418,7.9629,4.1494,3.2999,1.8272,1.1742,6.1101,2.342,5.2988,2.5801,1.5508,5.9167,3.043,3.7719,1.4349,0.0174,7.4054,0.0435,5.9292,0.5766,1.3896,2.7669,2.7548,2.7232,2.9666,2.7598,0.1319,2.54,6.6347,4.2778,3.9182,0.0374,1.4109,2.7676,3.7554,5.4045,2.0347,3.6448,3.0021,1.7533,0.0033,1.0726,3.9622,0.4489,5.2426,0.1379,0.4818,2.7615,13.0249,0.851,2.756,7.0156,2.1543,0.4775,1.7343,5.0203,2.6497,1.816,7.991,0.3201,1.8066,1.8268,2.7869,1.5613,4.8439,0.509,4.2112,2.455,7.5936,5.5252,0.2862,4.7192,5.9623,0.4281,0.424,9.1237,2.0617,2.3466,2.5508,3.9411,0.9808,5.7636,0.9764,2.7868,1.2791,2.6961,3.7742,4.7882,0.9553,5.097,0.7505,4.2771,4.0085,7.4454,4.7717,1.9995,0.9032,0.9698,1.9273,3.9153,0.2324,0.7907,6.8964,0.087,1.5233,2.6929,4.0508,5.6562,3.9789,5.5548,1.8077,0.5309,1.0809,1.1576,3.5283,1.7713,3.3929,0.9184,6.0482,2.6871,1.7517,1.3021,0.0414,6.4353,2.3167,6.0278,1.8214,1.0604,7.4219,2.4437,4.0799,2.5378,3.2602,1.527,0.1021,2.3453,4.4193,2.3152,0.6906,2.5608,3.7077,7.9011,3.3396,3.1588,2.1347,3.8149,1.4105,0.5422,1.4168,2.2716,4.2541,1.6032,0.2772,1.4988,6.2448,1.2216,2.6487,4.2877,1.213,0.002,3.6094,2.1245,4.7846,0.154,2.2538,2.4933,1.7592,1.6274,4.9877,1.9918,5.4238,3.3291,6.1179,2.8013,5.4683,0.9521,1.1125,0.8506,1.2938,0.3944,1.9286,2.5062,3.4947,0.9115,2.836,3.4138,1.7085,0.1236,2.8714,0.7333,4.8978,5.6945,0.0032,0.0008,1.795,8.0601,2.3948,0.0019,0.272,6.7917,2.6192,1.161,4.8913,0.4785,1.7925,2.3439,3.1198,3.1561,2.5115,5.6588,1.0317,1.4446,1.5821,0.9273,2.917,3.8821,1.6152,4.6815,0.7784,4.3217,0.8375,3.9946,0.0533,2.8251,3.6352,0.4626,0.2706,1.5949,4.3158,5.3744,1.9192,4.8522,0.1561,1.158,0.9912,6.8125,2.2554,2.5702,1.9157,1.3644,2.8138,1.4782,0.7146,1.1948,1.7756,6.0373,0.1654,4.333,1.6148,2.

{"prompt":"Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian . Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian , while others required additional letters : < unk > ( fi `` phi `` ) is","text":"Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian. Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian, while others required additional letters : < unk > ( fi `` phi `` ) is a new Georgian letter not found in the standard Georgian alphabet. In some cases, characters have been changed in the process of adaptation, but generally the sounds are similar and sound changes are minor.\nSome of the sounds are not yet mapped in the standard Georgian pronunciation dictionaries. The pronunciation of [\u014b] ( see above ), for example, has been difficult to pin down. A possible pronunciation, in which this sound is made without a vibrato, has been proposed by A.B.V. Savitsky. However, the more common way to pronounce this letter is with a long vowel sound.\nThe most important difference, for most people, comes from the fact that the Georgian sounds for many of the sounds in the Russian language \u2014 s, p, and l \u2014 do not exist in Georgian. The following sounds exist in Georgian.\nIn some dialects, the word for a vowel sound that sounds like a p is used to indicate a nasal sound. Some languages have no single terms for such nasal sounds. In the case of Georgian, this type of nasalization occurs when the vowel sounds between consonants are merged or merged \u2014 the result of which is close to the pronunciation of a consonantal nasal sound. For example, the vowel sounds between consonants in Russian words such as \u00ab \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b \u00bb (do-va-dy) and \u00ab \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e \u00bb (see-sy-vel'-el's-o) are combined into one ( \u00ab \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e \u00bb (do-va-dyas'ky-lev's-o)). The sound that appears in Russian, the nasal nasalized as the above, is pronounced in Georgian as [\u014b] ( see above ). In Georgia, the term \" b'a l't'a \" (\"baltata\") is a word that means the nasal sound above. In Georgian, the nasal nasalized sound in Russian is pronounced [\u014b] (see above).\nSome words in Georgia sound like Russian words. Such words are the result of borrowing from the Russian language, in addition to some new words that are created according to the standard Georgian orthography system.\nThe Georgian alphabet uses four diacritics that allow the Georgian script to be created using a more compact layout than the Latin alphabet. The diacritics are the acute ( \u0403 \u0405 ), circumflex ( \u0406 \u0408 ), and grave ( \u0408 \u0409 \u040a \u0409 ), and the combining sign ( \u0409 \u040a \u0409 ).\nFor many languages, a small diacritic is used to represent the sound of a single letter of the original script, the diacritic is usually raised above that letter. For example, in modern Greek, the sound of the letter \u0399 is represented by a diacritic that is raised above the \u03f0 letter. In Latin letters, the small \u040a \u040a \u040c \u0401 \u0405 \u040d \u0409 \u040a \u0409 \u040e symbol was used in the first few centuries of the Latin alphabet to indicate the pronunciation of several letters that did not have a similar pronunciation.\nIn the Georgian script, the acute diacritic \u0403 \u0405 was used to mark the pronunciation of the letters \u0401, \u0408, \u040e, \u0409, \u040a.

{"prompt":"Myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size \u2014 being the largest earthstar fungus \u2014 as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack . Historically","text":"Myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size \u2014 being the largest earthstar fungus \u2014 as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack. Historically, it was reported to develop as a white mycelium (columina albida) (Zhao and Wei 1993) but this has not been substantiated and is now considered unlikely. The mycelium becomes dark grey at maturity and is not covered with a distinct pallor that can be seen on some other species of earthstars. Despite its large size, the sporemat remains attached in a basal position to the agar. The basidium has been described as a simple one cell structure (Schmidt 1974). The species name coliforme was first used to describe a genus by Hufnagel (1871), who also used the adjective from Columba. The species epithet is derived from Columba, a genus of birds commonly known (in English) as \u201cbluebirds\u201d and, with minor variations, as \u201cthe woodpeckers\u201d.\nAs the temperature reaches 22 degrees Fahrenheit, it is time to transplant your baby plants outdoors to their permanent space.\nIf you planted young plants several weeks ago, they may not be ready to go outside yet. Let your plants bloom and flower for a few weeks longer before trying to transplant them, so they have a few weeks to adjust to the outside environment. Most plants grow faster and produce more leaves as the warm days progress. Transplants can be done at any point, but plants should be about 3 inches to 1 foot tall, and about 4 inches to 7 inches in diameter. A good transplanting time would be between mid-June and mid-July. The plants should be potted up to 12 inches and labeled for transplanting to include plant species, location, and the date they were planted. If temperatures are above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, they will be more comfortable outside.\nIf the weather is particularly hot, transplant your plants into a cooler part of your yard or a shady area for the first several weeks, and give them a break before allowing them outside again. In winter, it is always good practice to turn off your greenhouse a couple of weeks earlier so that your plants can get used to the cold. It is best to transplant them earlier in the spring to let them acclimate to the outside environment in a better place and start their growth earlier. Transplanting leaves that are still attached to the plants helps them make a better start in the new environment. Transplant the plants in the fall, when the conditions are cool and your plants are not in full growth yet.\nYou might find some tiny white saplings growing on the plants. These are the first signs the plants have a root system. By the time they have established roots, they will be smaller and they should begin to spread around the plant.\nThe ideal temperature range for your plants would be 55 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the first growing season.\nA good planting bed should have a good drainage and soil that is rich in organic matter, and have a pH level of 7 to 8. Good planting beds would have grass areas and native plants that provide protection for the plants as well as providing shade for the plants in the summer. It is always better to let your plants grow on a slightly sloped soil so that they can spread more of their roots. The soil will drain easily and the plants will have more light.\nThe plants should be planted in a hole about 3 inches deep and 1 foot wide. Space plants about 1 foot back in a line. It is a good idea to use a spade instead of a planter. In the beginning, you may want to make some fertilizer blends at home for your plants so that they will be in great shape when they come out of the greenhouse.","token_len":793,"entropy":[8.7598,10.8648,7.4962,7.7444,1.6773,1.2529,1.7773,0.7178,6.9417,6.6876,10.9597,5.5886,0.4341,3.5729,6.9353,6.72,6.9662,3.3006,1.0607,10.8945,11.6827,8.5258,3.1214,4.6348,0.2313,0.0185,2.0491,8.8051,8.1801,2.7472,0.5263,4.8648,4.3912,10.5274,2.044,6.429,8.2425,1.4514,10.2695,0.977,8.9531,0.1719,2.2664,1.2098,5.0054,0.7661,4.8878,2.9404,0.6039,5.2922,6.993,0.7678,0.0255,3.145,6.4715,5.3282,4.8727,8.4361,0.6779,4.4774,0.7001,4.2848,5.829,4.1041,2.1144,6.6135,4.5272,2.7933,2.2485,2.459,2.2995,1.3307,0.2601,3.6363,0.0022,3.9275,1.8167,2.8327,1.511,5.5884,0.9986,1.9533,4.2914,0.1313,0.2124,6.4186,5.1347,4.1285,4.0947,2.1643,1.0643,2.2781,3.3705,4.1006,1.152,2.3562,6.4381,6.6518,0.3677,4.3035,2.6659,0.5176,1.3909,1.9429,4.079,3.1497,2.6879,1.5505,2.122,3.619,0.737,5.5455,1.5689,3.5025,0.4355,0.318,1.2742,4.7042,0.0139,14.175,7.4201,6.9402,4.1467,1.3323,7.1535,3.0496,1.6869,0.3101,6.5854,0.2572,2.7657,1.4673,8.9043,9.3683,3.6377,2.3131,3.2957,0.7994,1.838,6.4793,6.0622,5.9344,3.727,2.295,4.6666,2.6735,5.8703,0.9263,1.5429,5.7085,4.1511,9.6862,1.1541,0.871,3.0574,3.1639,1.7304,1.9975,0.5539,1.8097,4.272,5.2409,4.7094,6.819,2.7868,0.2467,0.2835,0.929,2.4681,4.3054,1.5491,1.649,3.4779,2.4421,0.8838,6.1775,5.7092,11.1068,1.5707,3.1426,1.7221,2.8941,7.6213,1.2292,2.8465,2.265,0.0389,3.9753,0.1892,1.5367,1.8012,3.4035,0.6178,7.239,5.4267,1.559,6.5863,5.3327,3.5497,1.2775,0.269,10.8013,7.4808,9.8043,3.2805,3.3342,7.0282,1.8205,4.7274,4.4872,8.1899,0.8039,0.3782,2.8868,1.3177,1.2357,5.4628,7.4501,1.777,1.1571,0.2939,0.6562,0.0869,0.9486,2.371,13.8399,2.6269,7.1004,4.3232,6.0799,2.8822,2.4866,1.0641,3.4134,1.7321,6.0649,0.3527,7.5873,6.4045,6.2464,4.6555,7.8947,2.6204,5.3617,8.1107,5.6922,0.7825,3.4722,4.4547,0.3635,8.9174,7.6181,1.4706,8.3134,1.7739,0.7502,0.5975,2.487,2.3964,2.0977,1.6165,1.9332,1.1279,3.6423,2.4598,3.2884,0.6469,5.3961,1.497,0.9547,6.2681,2.319,5.6959,2.9605,1.8329,0.9486,1.4402,7.1117,1.4488,5.0953,0.5468,1.319,0.9372,4.4052,3.2237,1.5277,3.6627,1.307,4.1229,1.505,0.513,3.0646,0.7164,1.0616,3.2122,1.3874,0.3001,5.3425,1.4053,3.5539,5.3683,2.1121,3.4276,1.3833,2.5273,4.5446,2.2001,5.6628,5.3597,7.3058,0.446,9.2048,6.2922,0.8115,2.4472,0.9426,4.2073,3.161,1.3179,3.9925,3.0123,1.5049,4.2616,2.3467,0.4193,7.6123,2.9522,2.5519,4.8617,3.4221,2.8255,1.4066,2.1298,1.4683,3.2599,2.8308,0.4823,0.8647,3.8187,0.3828,1.0821,0.2375,0.364,4.2061,3.1552,3.3715,2.8695,2.6097,5.1065,0.1133,1.5255,5.6671,0.2281,2.6903,0.5617,0.8951,0.0093,1.3991,0.8399,2.822,2.5425,0.7024,0.5235,7.5272,0.0308,4.9225,3.5307,5.2758,3.1897,5.1722,9.1294,3.0883,1.4488,1.0989,2.8511,7.8794,5.3057,4.1391,2.05,6.7789,0.5552,0.8895,4.2075,3.809,3.4742,1.6393,1.5564,0.2568,2.6628,8.1312,1.3392,3.0791,4.7975,0.3805,0.8765,2.8748,7.3394,2.7156,0.5216,1.2707,0.3407,2.6406,1.4129,1.464,6.1958,7.2292,4.2113,0.739,1.469,2.4641,2.4557,5.1531,0.4084,5.3311,1.4557,0.5407,2.9867,2.2826,0.27,4.4109,1.3906,3.0824,4.7929,0.012,2.4289,2.5762,1.8488,3.429,4.7567,1.8915,3.9857,2.9249,2.2898,5.6224,0.5166,2.8867,1.9414,5.2326,0.3908,1.0071,4.2224,2.1216,6.2201,0.5635,4.3095,3.2936,0.3062,4.1933,3.4957,0.4139,3.5989,0.5027,6.0607,3.2947,3.9221,0.0838,5.6099,1.6665,2.6365,5.3344,7.0274,2.1008,0.364,1.4011,5.091,3.347,0.7806,2.1468,0.168,0.938,3.0665,3.518,0.0463,0.5908,2.5967,1.5157,3.8308,0.467,2.2933,0.176,2.4853,3.3381,5.467,1.9991,0.133,2.4809,2.5808,5.3856,0.3969,6.557,0.9253,0.0006,0.5327,0.4237,2.31,2.0863,4.6239,2.045,5.5347,3.7282,3.5422,5.5417,3.4962,2.3714,3.1104,1.0374,5.8635,0.2376,0.2588,4.5099,5.1623,0.9544,3.5795,2.1885,0.5054,0.3884,5.392,5.7943,2.0165,6.0703,2.6295,1.9137,4.8895,1.6008,0.7342,2.5697,1.1164,0.3497,4.9981,0.1399,4.418,1.3964,2.1139,1.6777,3.5268,2.3086,3.1946,1.1645,5.8898,0.3887,5.1122,1.3538,4.6187,0.5949,0.806,4.2831,3.4343,4.2974,3.8913,4.271,0.715,1.4507,3.7067,3.49,3.4194,4.0371,7.401,4.6106,7.8612,0.1072,2.2344,1.5187,1.0147,3.7516,1.7772,2.8869,1.1749,3.0372,3.4694,3.4803,4.1146,0.9671,1.664,4.4044,5.5363,0.14,2.1759,5.6774,2.3304,0.2929,1.053,2.665,4.8335,2.4815,0.4909,0.6733,1.8932,1.0769,7.047,1.0535,4.5213,2.459,3.9618,0.3966,6.0844,4.2323,0.9841,1.8542,0.732,2.492,2.4988,7.2033,3.1774,3.9802,0.3153,2.949,0.5137,4.0598,0.0535,4.8617,0.903,1.8075,0.2089,0.8635,3.939,1.9027,1.6126,7.476,0.1026,1.1894,2.7619,3.9338,2.848,5.99,4.9988,2.2797,2.954,1.1543,4.4277,2.1572,2.8129,3.8542,2.6677,1.0185,4.75,0.2385,2.5527,0.1199,2.0248,2.6434,5.301,1.2433,4.4292,3.1878,0.8392,2.6473,2.6509,0.7413,0.2698,6.0849,5.6971,1.6093,5.5557,2.1792,6.9349,6.0186,2.2201,8.1078,1.0378,1.9113,4.0088,5.0558,2.4022,0.7691,0.8122,4.7623,0.5063,0.0638,4.9781,2.4058,1.6306,0.4937,0.6963,3.922,0.7338,3.784,0.4637,4.6744,0.3518,4.0183,2.7354,0.061,4.8073,0.7731,0.101,0.7948,3.3793,1.2907,5.97,5.429,1.1525,3.4984,4.4376,0.2651,0.6407,0.906,5.3909,3.5149,6.1549,0.6146,1.5065,1.504,2.9365,1.9005,2.4861,8.2852,3.9566,1.2264,1.8598,1.1395,0.5288,2.9969,3.1087,4.8178,2.0892,1.2829,2.4352,2.801,0.9221,0.6858,2.6709,1.1708,

{"prompt":"By the terms of the Act , the critical dates with respect to concurrent registration are the date of the applicant \u2019 s first use and the earliest filing date of any other registrant .","text":"By the terms of the Act, the critical dates with respect to concurrent registration are the date of the applicant \u2019 s first use and the earliest filing date of any other registrant. The Act does not expressly state those dates are the two earliest date a registrant can file; however, it is the understanding of the Office that they are the two earliest date the registrant of record could file on a trademark.\nIt is therefore the policy of the Office to require applicants to file within the 60 day window after the first use. However, the 60 day window cannot begin to run until the date the applicant \u2019 s first use was filed.\nThe policy to require filing within 60 days after the date of the first use has now been in effect for 20 years and the number of registrations so filed has varied over the years.\nThe purpose of this section is for the applicant to be assured that he\/she is making a filing that is due to the applicant \u2019 s last filing date since the time the registrant has its first use. This does not affect the right of the applicant to file a contemporaneous trademark in the United States.\nIt is very unlikely to find an agreement with applicants whereby the applicant uses a registrant \u2019 s first use date as the date of filing. It is very rare to find an agreement whereby the applicants agree to file their application after the first use date rather than concurrently. But if it should happen to the applicant, the policy should take its place.\nSo, if two applicants each file their applications concurrently for the same domain name during an overlapping period, then the Office is entitled to treat the application filed earlier as the filed concurrently with the application filed later. This would allow that application to be filed to be the first application filed under the domain name.\nIt is considered by the Office that an applicant will file their application to be the first registration for the domain name of his\/her choice. But due to the fact that more companies with the same business name register the domain name, the application will not be the first for long. That said, the benefit of the first filing under the Act is that once the trademark is registered they are entitled to use it for all of the purposes, and not just in their business registration.\nThe same rule applies in the case of a business name with a different registration. But in those cases it will be considered that the business entity filed their application before the business entity. The first to file is the entity of record and not necessarily the same business entity to whom the trademark application is filed.\nIt must be noted that the rule does NOT apply to registered businesses and trademarks registered for \u201cproducts and services\u201d.\nI wish to ask a very basic question..I have a website with a domain.CO.UK registered by me in my first name. Do I need to register the brand name as well? Or this domain is already registered in my name? I have no website or any other business.\nA trademark registration will not guarantee approval for a trademark to be used. However, if you file a request for the trademark on its first registration, this will certainly be seen as an advantage to the Office. The Office is considering that the first filer is the company from which the applicant is associated.\nIt applies to both the individual who owns the domain name and the business entity that registers the trademark application.

{"prompt":"Fowler 's career began with Liverpool . He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the middle of 1991 , signing professional terms on his 17th birthday , 9 April 1992 .","text":"Fowler's career began with Liverpool. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the middle of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992. The \u00a350,000 fee was an astronomical fee at the time, but his first season with the Merseyside giants went so well for the 18-year-old that he was awarded the club's Player of the Year award.\nFowler began his league career with two consecutive goals in an FA Cup clash against Leeds at Elland Road and he also appeared in the UEFA Cup under Manager Paul Ince, opening the scoring in a 7\u20131 victory against Dynamo Kiev. With Liverpool's squad decimated by World Cup leseighs, Fowler became Steven Gerrard's second-choice striker in 1992 \/ 1993, making 15 league starts with three assistances. His consistent performances led to his being handed managerial coaching by Ince in August 1993 following the death of manager Roy Evans. In April 1993 Fowler was the leading scorer when the club won all eight of their matches in the 1994 FA Cup winning 5\u20132 against Manchester United in a game played at Hillsborough Stadium.\nFowler signed a long-term contract and moved on to Manchester United during the 1995 transfer window on a fee of \u00a31 million. He made his debut on 9 April against Charlton and scored his first league goal on 23 April in the home defeat against Chelsea United. He had a torrid time in the Premier League that season, playing only 20 matches for the club before he joined Arsenal in October 1995 on a \u00a320 million fee. He made his debut in the opening game of the 1996\u201397 Premier League season against Newcastle United at the Old Trafford and scored both the opening and closing goals in a 5\u20130 victory. He netted three more times for the Gunners, one on a penalty in their FA Cup victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Wembley Stadium in the fifth round. It was Fowler's only FA Cup success for Arsenal as the club were eliminated the quarter-finals by Norwich City.\nIn December 1998 Fowler had one of his worst seasons in the Premier League, playing only ten games as Arsenal were relegated. A couple of weeks later Fowler was fined \u00a310,000 and dismissed from the Arsenal reserves because of the fight with Peter Ofori at a team practice. He was sent off again in May 1999 for what has been seen as one of his best performances in the Premier League in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United. During the 1999\u20132000 season, he was given the opportunity to play for the first team on the left wing as Arsenal struggled with injuries. That position was kept open in the 2001\u201302 season, although Fowler only played five times in all competitions for the Gunners that season. Fowler was released by Arsenal in March 2003.\nFowler came back to his hometown and signed for Birmingham City in November 2003. He retired at the end of the 2007 season, but returned briefly to the side in the 2009 season to play against Aston Villa, with Fowler being sacked just 11 days later.\n\nCoaching career\n\nFowler worked at Arsenal and West Ham United as assistant managers.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFowler's father, John, was a member of the original West Ham United team that won the 1947 FA Cup Final. John also played for Everton and Tottenham. Fowler, who was a friend of both his parents, was offered to leave West Ham Utd in the January transfer window and move to Spain to join Valencia, but then he decided to go to the youth team of Manchester United.\nFowler married his long-time friend and first training partner, Kate Coley in 1988.

{"prompt":"In 1947 , Vojvodina 's Ministry of Agriculture complained to Serbia 's Ministry of Forestry that the authorities in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands , and then to Croatia 's Ministry of","text":"In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture complained to Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the authorities in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Transport and Water Resources, as had been agreed at a meeting on the Vukovar river in 1937.\nA letter from the Croatian Ministry to the Bosnian Ministry of Agriculture, in which Croatia was asked to make arrangements with Bosnian officials to allow the passage of boats, was answered by the Bosnian Ministry that it believed \" the agreement had a general nature, that it did not include the passage of goods, or any other question of the land, and moreover that Bosnian customs had nothing to do with such matters.\"\nIn 1950, the Ministry of Agriculture in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia declared that forests protected by foresters were \" national \", and that anyone who destroyed them could be tried for treason.\nThe situation regarding Croatian forests continued despite a ceasefire and subsequent negotiations between the governments of Yugoslavia and Croatia, following the NATO bombing raids in Operation Deliberate Force in April 1999.\nIn August 1969, there was an agreement between the People's Republic of Croatia and the Socialist Republic of Hungary concerning the rights of croatian citizens living on the Hungarian \/ Czech border.\nThis agreement stipulated that Croatian citizens should be given ownership over the land they had been living on since before the 19th century, that they would be allowed to use and dispose of the land in accordance with the regulations of the Hungarian Republic, and that any dispute regarding ownership would be resolved by an arbitration commission.\nThe Croatian Ministry of Agriculture subsequently declared that Croatian citizens' property rights in the Czech Republic ( bordering Hungary ) would be upheld through the Croatian Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Development ( the predecessor to the Croatian Institute of Property Registration and State Registry ) or through Croatian diplomatic representation if they decided to challenge the agreement directly.\nThe Croatian Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Development later informed the ministry that under the terms of the agreement the Czech Republic had accepted Croatian citizens' right to build houses in the Czech Republic by issuing land ownership titles and by constructing homes.\nIn December 1999, a survey was conducted to determine the extent of croatian property in Eastern Slavonia and South-Eastern Croatia.\nOn 23 March 2000, the Croatian Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Development reported that it had completed the transfer procedure for land in the former Republic of Croatia, and that it intended to transfer all land that was not owned and managed by third persons.\nAt the beginning of January 2002, the Croatian Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Development stated that it had received 9,000 requests for land transfer in the former Republic of Croatia since 1993.\nCroatian citizens wishing to register their land ownership and use rights in the former Republic of Croatia must apply to the National Bureau of State Registry and Land Registration ( the predecessor to the Croatian Institute of Property Registration and State Registry ) and wait for over a year before receiving a title.\nThese delays can be explained by the fact that the Bureau, and the Institute, receives some 90,000 such applications each year.\nIn its 2003 report on Croatia, the Working Group noted that it had been unable to confirm the full legal status of land ownership and use rights before 23 March 2000.\nCroatia has stated publicly that the majority of Croats living in the former Republic of Croatia have lost their Croatian citizenship, and that they have been given the option of choosing between Croatian citizenship or the opportunity to obtain dual citizenship with one of two neighbouring states - the Republic of Serbia or the Republic of Montenegro.\nIn the latter case, they would lose their former citizenship.\nIn 2002 the Yugoslav authorities announced that a Croatian citizenship law would be introduced in May 2003 in order to allow Croat citizens living in the former Republic of Croatia to have their citizens'rights, as well as their Croatian citizenship, fully

{"prompt":"Coleridge and William Wordsworth were close friends and collaborators ; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was , in Bott 's word , inevitable","text":"Coleridge and William Wordsworth were close friends and collaborators ; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott's word, inevitable that Coleridge should form a friendship with the young poet ;'we found ourselves'he says, 'to have the same room with [ Wordsworth ] during our summer vacations at Grasmere and Thirlmere '. [ See also Sir William Stubbs in his collection of Coleridge's letters ] This friendship in turn was reciprocated ; in 1801 Dorothy died, Coleridge was deeply moved by the news ; and the death of her friend made a deep impression upon him years afterwards, when he was writing in 1802 the poem that became Wordsworth's first publication in this country, 'A Ballad in the South-West. '\nHis own poems were first printed in England by William Makepeace Thackeray,'the man before whom in all England the literary world bowed,'in the second volume of his'New Year's Eve Letters ', 1806, though no copy bearing the poet's name is preserved ( see'Poem at an Exhibition') ; but in 1807 a volume was published under the name of Samuel Taylor Coleridge by J. J. Thompson, a Cambridge friend, in which was included his poem'To a Water-Portrait and Poems illustratively written upon it, by Thos. Warton'( of the critical biographies of several of the authors here illustrated he is chiefly responsible ; see the preface to his edition of Pope's'An Essay on Criticism ', published in 1814.'These poems are said to have been written chiefly while the poet was staying with Wordsworth at Coleridge's house at Arthington near Grasmere, in 1801 ('Letters ', ii. 27, 28, 29 ) ; he was accompanied by his friend William Milnes. The work was first exhibited in November 1807.\nIn later life his letters and poems were edited and published by his first wife, Elizabeth Taylor, and his work edited and published by her second husband, Dr Richard Henry Taylor. A volume of them was published by J.M. Dent, London, 1877, and there has recently appeared a new edition edited by his daughter, Elizabeth Taylor Coleridge, for Macmillan and Co.\nBott wrote Coleridge a letter some years ago :'I think that, with all his faults, there were very few which you could not forgive. '\nAs a matter of fact he seems at the time to have forgiven Coleridge everything but the fact that the latter had left him, but his attitude later became more equanimous. During his life the friendship was not formally broken, and the poet wrote to Bott,'' You asked me to write to you about this matter. \" I could not do this... I was at once aware that from this time I should no longer... be able to speak one word with him on the most trivial of any matter... You see now that what I said was quite true.''\nThe matter at issue was that it had been understood by them both that a separation would occur unless the poet accepted the situation as he found it. Bott in his later life could remember no incident whereby an irritation was generated. There was no personal conflict at all ; but the poet showed little interest in a new friendship between him and his brother Charles John. Coleridge and Wordsworth were now living in London, and he often visited them; but the friendship, though it remained sincere, was less close than it had been during the earlier years.\nThe period of Coleridge's'healthful solitude'and his later years were very different from the earlier days of his life ; but, like Wordsworth, he regarded his relations with Mr and Mrs Taylor as very different from those with the elder Bott and Dorothy

However, it was not broadcast live \u2014 it was recorded and `` highlights `` of the performances were aired live on CMT. With guest artists, it played out in the studio where the performances were filmed, a venue which had similar themes on each of the previous two Jingle Ball programs. The two-hour evening broadcast started with a 30-minute montage of the previous episodes.\nI have two pairs of jeans that are about 5 years old and they are still in great condition. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to make them better, or at least make them last longer? The first pair is the regular cotton boyfriend style. The second pair is the stretchy jeans. I only wear these because sometimes I need a pair of regular denim. I don't think they are that stretchy, I think it's cotton. I wear them daily, and sometimes twice a day. I don't wear any other types so I can't tell you if the stretchy jeans are harder to get off of. Can anyone help me think of a way to make them better? They are definitely not that worn out, but I am not satisfied with the color or size.\nDoes an old pairs of jeans work better because of the way they stretch out over your body? I have a pair of jeans that fit so I can wear them comfortably all day. I wear them at work and out for coffee and drinks. I'm not sure if there's anything I can do with these. They are definitely from a longer time ago.\nWhat is the stretch factor you speak of? I think jeans stretch more in the knees. But don't know if that matters.\nAlso, can I tell you how many pairs of jeans I have? Oh, man. It's a good thing I stopped having kids because I would have more. My wife makes fun of me for saying I'd get through them and I always joke about not having the space to display them in my dressing room. lol I'm trying to buy new ones and think about doing something special for them, maybe making them with extra details on them. Maybe even with some embroidery? I like jeans with unique details.\nI like my jeans but haven't purchased new jeans since my son graduated from high school! I am not a size 12 so I always have trouble finding jeans that fit. I was wearing a size 12 when I got married and was wearing a 12 year old pair of jeans during the first year of our marriage! And then he graduated and he said, \"are you still wearing those old mom jeans?\" I was in heaven, it was a special day for him as he graduated. And he loves jeans! So, I got him a nice pair of jeans for me from JC Penny. They are blue and brown. They look so good and he's so excited. Hopefully he'll be able to carry them for a while but right now, they look good!\nI have a pair of jeans that I'm wearing because the last pair wasn't my own style and had to be taken off to get in them. I was wearing them with a black tank top and leather jacket. They fit perfect...until a rainstorm came through.\nI can't say that I'd recommend wearing someone else's worn out jeans. I have the best luck in finding my own jeans here. I prefer to see if somebody can get their clothing made and I'm willing to take a risk in that, too. It's a lot happier to look good in my own clothes than to be uncomfortable in someone else's. At this point, I have jeans from both stores that have lasted three times longer than the average pair.\nI did a little research on you and found the following blogsite where you can view a number of postings of jeans that are older, used, and still in good
