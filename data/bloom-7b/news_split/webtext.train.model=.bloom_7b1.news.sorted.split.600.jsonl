{"prompt":"Susan Collins , one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate , is expected to announce on Friday whether she will run for governor of Maine next year in what would be","text":"Susan Collins, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate, is expected to announce on Friday whether she will run for governor of Maine next year in what would be her third consecutive bid. Collins is likely to make a decision within the week, said a Democrat who will seek a seat on the Maine Supreme Court once Collins leaves the Senate. Collins\u2019 announcement would set the stage for a bitter primary battle in the Republican primary. A source close to the senator said Friday she is weighing the options of whether to get the nomination and enter the primary in January, or to stand as a noncandidate. Her decision would come early enough that any of the candidates would not have to take a break from their state house or senate assignments. \u201cI would like to help get her nomination on the ballot,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., a longtime ally of Collins, said Friday. The GOP senator\u2019s opponent, Susan Collins\u2019 husband, Ed, said he is proud that one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the Senate is exploring the possibility of a run at governor next year. Ed Collins, who previously served as chief of staff for Bill Shorten in the state Legislature, said his wife has been considering running for governor since 2016. \u201cThere would be a tremendous amount of support and we could take down the incumbent,\u201d Ed Collins told reporters Friday. A top Republican aide said Ed Collins\u2019 announcement will likely lead to a showdown in the primary. Asked whether Ed Collins would be the Republican nominee, said, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a race there,\u201d indicating at least some of the candidate who wins that primary \u2014 and potentially the GOP nominee \u2014 will be expected to make his or her next bid for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018. Ed Collins, a self-described \u201cconservative conservative\u201d who supports traditional values, said he doesn\u2019t want to run so his wife wouldn\u2019t have to. Asked if he would support Ed running for governor, he said, \u201cIf she\u2019s serious about it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Ed Collins\u2019 announcement was expected, he said. But he said he wasn\u2019t making any personal suggestions, \u201cbut I think he has a lot of supporters in the party \u2026 if that\u2019s her decision.\u201d Sen.

{"prompt":"Cyril Ramaphosa , the new leader of South Africa s governing ANC party , said on Thursday he aims to stamp out corruption and pursue a policy of radical economic transformation that will speed up","text":"Cyril Ramaphosa, the new leader of South Africa s governing ANC party, said on Thursday he aims to stamp out corruption and pursue a policy of radical economic transformation that will speed up the building of a more equitable, prosperous and green country. \"We must fight corruption. We must transform our society to be one where we can all live and work without fear,\" Ramaphosa told SA s parliament as he unveiled his government's fouryear plan of action. In the course of his campaign for the ANC's presidential nomination in March, the country's top politician pledged to push forward a program called Economic Stability and Growth Council (ESGC), which he said would transform the economy from one based on extraction to one based on innovation. He also called for the government to create incentives for businesses to locate and expand in Southern Africa, a target known as SA4Africa. \"We have to put in place a fairer system for the wealth and rewards that we extract locally and we exploit our resources for the benefit of all South Africans,\" he said. But some say the ambitious ideas will take years to develop. \"The government... is on good note, but it's very very far away,\" said Johan Giesbrecht, a former Minister of Communications and who now runs a small investment firm. South Africa's growing economy has helped spur global demand for its platinum, coal, uranium and diamond resources, but inequality remains a key problem and the African nation still struggles to make headway in reducing unemployment. \"It is a very difficult path,\" said Ramaphosa, who added that the party would make every effort to build on the country s recent economic gains. \"The government knows there is a long way to go and if we can get people to invest in this new economy and create opportunity, then we will certainly have a better country,\" he added. Ramaphosa said the government would look at reforming the country's tax system, make major investments in clean energy, such as wind and solar, and encourage South Africans to invest in renewable energy. Meanwhile, the government would seek to reduce its dependency on South Africa's main natural gas supplier NOC, which it says controls almost half of domestic gas exports from the Transkei and parts of Kwazulu Natal. The government plans to step up its involvement in South Africa s mining industry, which it says is under the control of a small elite. Ramaphosa said the government would set up an economic council to create strategies and policies that would allow the country to diversify and prosper in this field. The council, which Ramaphosa said would include business leaders, will take an active role in the creation of policies to allow mines to compete on international markets and promote the development of modern technologies in the field. Ramaphosa also pledged to end the South Africa s black apartheid legacy of underdevelopment by putting in place an economic development plan that will include measures to improve the social security and social services of black citizens.","token_len":600,"entropy":[8.7955,1.9633,8.8622,4.0463,0.0751,1.425,2.8582,5.2239,3.8306,0.1039,6.8633,1.5287,12.7424,10.6282,3.6159,2.122,0.8294,2.1528,2.1207,2.2975,2.3952,7.9094,0.0501,7.3062,0.0585,1.9172,1.4008,7.2887,1.9104,3.791,0.1918,6.8046,3.9187,3.4603,2.5683,1.4765,7.7582,0.4647,1.2847,7.1816,0.0835,1.1344,3.2997,2.9234,3.049,2.3521,0.7167,6.0079,3.5088,0.1897,4.1179,1.4749,2.6311,4.3969,1.1338,2.7763,0.6312,0.2817,5.7332,1.2673,2.056,2.193,3.2441,3.4433,1.0781,2.6028,1.7462,3.5812,1.2587,2.7148,0.3762,4.0631,1.3261,1.6506,1.1078,0.004,0.0002,1.3176,6.1255,13.865,3.8901,5.1418,0.5367,3.6309,0.8656,4.0481,0.2149,6.1435,10.7588,0.461,5.0446,3.6484,0.8773,4.838,1.698,4.5401,0.0006,1.0804,5.2165,3.1778,1.0159,2.8698,1.6537,2.3732,0.5381,1.8046,2.8854,0.4014,2.3867,3.9207,0.2615,2.5969,3.0875,4.6799,0.2179,4.8257,3.6198,1.8234,4.7853,4.509,4.9361,6.2155,1.2691,1.0536,8.0683,1.2826,0.2051,1.1765,1.199,0.6862,2.5512,0.7479,0.3664,3.7191,1.1485,2.4185,3.9697,2.9956,3.4716,0.0695,7.1284,1.0078,0.1253,0.2149,0.0376,4.1663,0.8207,2.8758,1.5854,2.8081,0.2476,2.0558,2.7946,0.0954,3.207,6.3756,0.6837,2.088,0.2671,5.802,2.2405,2.2999,0.8857,7.1237,0.161,1.4046,3.1147,5.6127,6.7575,0.3539,7.4839,8.2503,8.4533,0.0055,0.6506,1.8522,1.3901,2.4737,0.6465,4.3394,2.0851,0.0524,1.492,5.4805,0.0029,2.3873,1.6428,2.1687,6.8622,2.0898,8.6089,1.9059,1.9914,5.9613,6.5973,1.3986,4.1583,12.9828,2.1567,1.543,3.3524,1.7279,0.6947,0.0207,1.7969,3.9647,0.096,0.353,0.9529,0.1811,0.5692,4.019,4.5554,4.9682,1.2293,5.8376,6.4344,3.5151,4.5132,2.4171,0.5248,3.1107,1.1164,1.753,2.156,2.9282,9.7169,2.1521,5.059,7.3678,8.4166,2.3822,1.0087,1.8021,1.6339,3.6531,5.6512,3.4946,2.1122,1.4894,0.7589,8.3082,0.512,5.1877,4.8586,2.0746,0.0582,0.1739,1.3931,2.0249,6.1465,0.4876,5.4637,0.9772,8.9468,1.3973,1.4487,1.54,4.3852,3.9428,2.2165,1.4008,4.3546,0.3325,0.5398,6.7071,2.3142,1.4654,3.6043,2.9981,5.5443,4.5948,0.2157,2.7176,7.7017,1.8405,5.7853,1.1875,4.1479,0.3358,4.0804,2.5581,0.9172,2.3855,7.0483,2.0922,1.6604,3.642,1.5794,3.4115,2.2506,5.7031,3.6759,3.7973,2.5785,0.4491,3.4062,4.7242,0.0006,0.8513,4.9998,4.0501,0.665,2.6139,2.6709,1.5795,2.231,2.5801,1.4847,6.5337,2.1546,0.6828,4.8817,0.0321,0.0019,0.983,0.4947,5.9781,0.5373,1.6882,5.5921,2.5615,4.4262,5.0885,0.1769,0.0479,3.9519,2.3902,1.1076,3.3432,9.5177,4.4198,2.6868,3.869,0.5083,1.4579,2.4387,2.284,5.7949,3.6641,0.6866,1.0571,3.5664,0.1383,0.0216,0.0091,2.6539,4.0644,1.1799,2.4016,2.667,4.1927,0.669,3.0666,0.9113,3.3552,4.5089,1.2655,2.4013,3.1688,5.7832,0.9087,1.0578,0.8263,1.2803,6.2297,3.1967,0.6104,3.0427,2.8455,1.4159,0.2017,2.4546,0.0512,3.8621,0.0041,0.0018,1.6199,1.4223,1.9299,0.962,4.609,1.1602,5.4694,1.004,2.4214,0.3885,3.346,0.5466,1.2292,6.0094,6.3671,0.7009,0.2079,3.9937,0.3038,0.9931,7.895,0.0016,3.5256,0.8993,0.0261,0.4956,0.4589,4.3709,6.2047,0.8599,0.0537,2.3585,0.2056,3.2292,0.2434,1.118,6.1098,0.0747,1.9116,2.1114,3.5552,3.2387,0.2762,3.8493,2.991,4.2419,0.0109,4.9866,0.8349,0.197,4.1787,6.0483,0.1462,1.5801,5.7158,6.0997,1.3707,0.6254,3.2216,1.9663,6.6672,4.3162,1.3545,0.2586,7.5476,2.0553,3.3531,4.8563,0.9444,8.1929,3.4019,0.0378,2.7168,7.0954,0.0098,6.2172,6.7036,0.0276,2.3094,0.1774,1.0229,1.9427,1.3494,4.0557,0.0448,6.2121,0.0276,1.8023,4.7521,0.3077,2.8907,0.1423,3.1421,4.7361,1.5362,1.2443,1.5679,2.2017,0.7799,1.4553,4.3315,4.5507,1.119,0.0144,2.5705,3.9663,4.5641,1.1358,3.931,0.0056,0.0015,1.0187,0.9605,0.5992,0.5946,4.0446,0.412,2.0531,4.0966,5.2545,0.7922,4.7113,7.981,2.2102,3.9949,1.9329,0.8271,4.148,1.8666,1.221,1.4456,3.9648,0.0003,2.095,4.9602,2.3843,5.6137,5.7001,0.3029,2.0705,3.4165,2.1231,1.166,4.4537,0.0023,0.0015,1.0733,0.8448,2.1816,3.3947,0.6815,0.7566,1.965,4.1843,4.2277,1.0953,0.1097,0.1109,2.0646,4.3228,0.1842,5.3255,1.4312,5.9371,6.8055,0.5525,2.9418,3.1995,5.1156,0.6955,1.7796,3.6221,2.1755,1.7812,0.061,6.5359,3.4969,2.923,1.3306,2.97,0.9219,3.3753,0.0062,0.0016,1.7504,3.0312,0.2357,4.6148,1.2604,4.7227,2.35,1.7707,4.8731,7.9239,4.4541,3.4081,6.5285,1.1886,3.4883,4.629,1.9108,0.0155,2.9188,2.6383,1.3042,1.1483,1.1877,2.5238,4.3384,4.8062,0.3232,2.6921,1.4762,4.4489,3.2355,2.8325,2.572,3.3367,0.738,3.5759,3.0678,0.7501]}
{"prompt":"Republicans could hold onto control of Virginia \u2019 s legislature after a race that had appeared to change the balance of power was ruled a tie on Wednesday , setting the stage for the winner","text":"Republicans could hold onto control of Virginia \u2019 s legislature after a race that had appeared to change the balance of power was ruled a tie on Wednesday, setting the stage for the winner to be declared on Wednesday, March 1. This is the second time in a week that Democrats made a major effort to retake control of the legislature and could be the second setback for Democrats heading into a general election in November \u2026 Republican candidates have run strong in many of these races in recent years, but they have lost momentum since 2010 in Virginia after the death of their former governor, George Washington, and a state Senate that is increasingly dominated by Republicans\u2026.\nVirginia Democrats, meanwhile, are losing seats and have made a number of policy initiatives, including funding for public schools, a campaign finance reform, abortion regulations and criminal justice reform, but without much success. On the other hand, Virginia Republicans have been able to hold a strong majority in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2010 after gaining control of the state legislature in the 2004 gubernatorial election.\nVeteran House Speaker and R-Va. Rep. Joseph Cannon, has been challenged for re-election by Republican challenger Rep. Mike McMorris, a former Democratic Representative who is attempting to take on a popular Republican incumbent. McMorris has been endorsed by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\nRep. David Scott, the Democratic nominee for Virginia Speaker, said that he will not run for reelection after one term and that it will be up to the House Democratic Caucus to determine who they\u2019ll run for the next term.\nRep. Scott said that as of this morning, 10 House Democrats have publicly endorsed another House member as their nominee, citing the importance of the current moment and noting that their focus is on passing legislation.\n\u201cWe need a new majority leader in the House, who represents the views of our party and has a reputation for getting things done,\u201d said Rep. David Scott, the nominee for Speaker, in a statement.\nWhile Democrats don\u2019t expect to face off with the Republicans in the primary, they are also expected to face off with Democrats, the majority party, on their own party lines.\nWhen asked if he would run for re-election at the end of his current term, Rep. Bruce Wunder of Bedford, Virginia, said that he would not be re-contesting his seat \u2013 the second-longest running member in the House and the longest-serving Republican in the House.\n\u201cI know this is a topic that wasn\u2019t necessarily discussed in my remarks last night, but I don\u2019t plan to run,\u201d Wunder said in response to a reporter\u2019s question on the Democratic side of the issue.\nThere is speculation that Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland are expected to run, but Rep. Van Hollen said that he has not yet considered running for re-election.","token_len":600,"entropy":[6.1634,5.5369,2.6527,3.4108,0.0832,5.9416,14.916,7.8187,8.0736,6.5832,4.1727,2.9758,6.3906,1.3118,3.9528,6.8898,0.825,6.883,1.2893,3.7983,0.2882,0.0576,6.4623,6.3776,2.0219,1.1751,3.3443,2.6148,2.1291,5.5591,1.9114,0.1389,0.0174,1.812,6.3147,1.4735,1.7292,2.7762,2.4665,3.3609,2.0771,3.2784,2.7547,0.6062,5.539,1.8478,0.9158,1.7192,1.0123,1.005,2.1448,2.4539,0.2048,3.5386,7.1259,1.5187,3.5827,3.2176,0.046,3.2143,0.689,0.0933,0.4389,2.0888,3.0646,4.5533,2.4938,2.7493,5.3806,9.4959,0.6378,3.9027,4.9127,0.0683,2.8869,3.0369,0.0084,2.165,1.4202,7.9001,5.4754,4.6927,2.304,5.2911,4.0464,3.1751,5.419,0.7675,2.9231,0.9298,3.1637,0.4465,1.8981,0.9276,1.1459,2.2099,1.2891,3.049,4.8849,4.6245,3.9742,3.6081,1.6881,5.6149,1.9426,4.299,0.0237,3.18,2.669,1.3374,0.8479,4.2152,7.3126,1.3522,1.0251,2.7161,4.069,1.7857,5.23,3.1216,4.8217,3.5975,0.0079,0.9041,6.8025,2.3282,18.4518,3.4936,3.7498,2.7453,0.006,1.4259,5.0947,3.95,2.9697,3.5571,4.5532,2.4274,1.7788,0.0074,4.2455,5.2524,2.3132,0.6689,5.6501,1.5774,4.2355,1.7277,0.8662,2.5373,5.7213,2.5764,0.2175,3.333,6.6121,6.2897,0.7952,5.8985,0.1942,0.1494,0.7476,3.8744,5.8198,2.4736,1.7838,0.9313,4.8807,2.0868,2.1776,0.1006,0.0056,3.7914,1.3228,1.2177,2.0735,2.3197,0.0166,3.0349,3.316,4.3642,2.2027,0.682,0.5315,3.7952,0.0011,0.0024,0.0236,0.4654,0.49,0.5296,3.4673,1.7458,4.3502,5.1018,0.7339,0.2322,0.3683,1.1805,1.5152,0.878,2.7605,4.5667,2.8896,0.3536,0.7534,1.0781,14.3281,0.3697,5.4794,0.9721,4.5314,7.3196,0.7353,3.5318,0.553,1.5763,0.0017,6.4822,8.6797,1.4643,6.4091,1.5618,8.1075,2.6489,3.2617,0.024,0.0042,2.19,2.5592,2.6157,4.2553,0.0006,4.0957,7.9161,2.0115,0.0026,6.1342,2.1612,1.332,4.7654,6.1658,2.0764,2.2895,6.2413,0.0555,3.1923,3.3143,2.8556,6.596,1.6868,0.8422,1.1987,1.8848,0.0009,0.0008,1.5424,1.981,4.0522,0.0337,3.5654,3.2626,0.005,2.3777,0.0033,3.2724,0.9436,4.0132,0.0352,4.2091,6.4273,0.7098,2.8097,4.015,3.3931,0.3257,1.9111,6.0703,0.8568,3.0226,2.2371,1.359,2.5805,1.8449,1.2179,0.7649,1.3883,3.475,6.4831,2.7142,2.995,1.1995,3.9377,2.3309,0.3914,0.8441,0.0145,1.1668,2.5234,4.613,1.4455,0.2943,2.7126,2.0413,2.9056,18.4284,3.2391,3.8687,1.1343,1.0339,2.3474,2.7723,2.0096,0.3436,0.633,2.5667,0.0238,4.4043,1.5829,0.6684,5.0073,2.7735,2.6459,2.2006,0.4321,7.3137,2.1438,0.4587,1.2929,5.9473,1.0218,7.3774,3.6598,3.6818,4.3205,1.3259,2.8278,1.3735,5.5509,1.5961,4.0842,0.0482,1.8541,5.5134,10.0452,2.3933,5.5835,0.1655,4.5269,6.1602,1.1229,0.4782,4.714,1.391,1.9582,0.5819,5.176,5.5345,8.5043,3.7927,2.4367,2.3484,5.1327,3.8989,2.3966,0.651,0.2264,2.1665,2.62,4.5318,1.1163,6.1931,0.2201,3.1088,3.4308,1.4107,4.1665,1.9756,5.7323,0.7419,5.3812,0.2025,0.0185,2.1304,8.9779,6.4768,4.2018,0.4876,0.0024,2.9864,1.4283,0.3773,1.4574,7.7004,0.3297,2.0585,2.1254,1.0743,0.4514,0.4687,0.6784,0.6258,5.3318,4.4549,5.7778,2.4508,2.3428,0.132,3.0308,1.3534,4.8781,3.303,1.8726,2.6471,1.4268,0.8359,1.4091,4.5874,0.7604,1.5627,1.4862,3.6775,3.0714,0.0052,2.9135,1.1073,0.4481,3.3347,3.2649,4.7178,4.6781,1.0059,1.3594,3.1782,3.3548,3.0625,3.159,2.7378,1.2129,0.7941,5.5258,0.757,1.2454,1.327,1.365,1.4174,0.5297,1.4785,0.0034,0.0003,5.4733,1.3102,1.3993,0.0022,2.6588,3.2977,0.0671,0.2208,0.9666,0.0028,6.1782,8.3936,9.1254,7.0327,7.1087,1.3829,3.0356,0.5819,0.8008,1.5047,0.5491,0.9071,1.6444,2.8318,4.8318,0.0291,10.0117,4.9107,1.8295,1.388,7.1029,3.4857,5.1786,2.481,4.2288,0.0074,2.6974,7.6079,2.0803,0.3889,0.5942,3.5806,1.2936,1.9733,1.4355,0.0617,2.8383,0.7208,0.5047,1.6448,0.8451,0.4929,2.5541,0.5737,4.3358,5.6122,3.8808,0.9673,1.2041,6.2384,0.7306,7.7716,0.7945,1.6064,0.1851,6.2107,2.6928,1.617,3.901,5.6959,3.3316,0.9498,0.9144,0.504,0.8163,3.6916,0.1083,0.1638,0.019,4.7465,0.37,1.4492,3.6846,1.3704,3.6096,1.69,0.0011,0.6603,1.9542,4.2098,0.0748,1.1144,3.1423,4.1891,0.2975,1.1468,0.2604,2.8958,1.5713,6.0352,1.8988,0.7397,0.131,2.4824,0.2206,0.3414,5.4507,1.4907,5.8639,0.2944,1.8492,0.0032,4.4867,1.4313,0.0001,2.1037,0.1999,3.4419,0.4994,0.0014,3.954,0.8427,0.0002,0.0,0.258,0.425,1.2901,4.9707,0.009,1.1051,2.1429,1.2749,3.3982,0.0027,5.7719,0.1207,0.0023,1.6807,1.0539,1.0154,2.646,0.9257,1.183,4.0334,1.8836,1.4845,0.2741,0.0009,0.0006,0.4636]}
{"prompt":"Republicans in the U.S. Congress reached a deal on tax legislation on Wednesday , clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that , if approved , would be sent to President","text":"Republicans in the U.S. Congress reached a deal on tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to President Obama for his signature.\nDemocrats say they want to save billions of dollars in tax cuts, some of which would be passed to the business community as a credit to their profits. Republicans say the tax cuts for the rich are necessary.\nThe Senate and House of Representatives reached a last-minute agreement on an updated version of spending bill that would fund several agencies in the United States and, if approved, will be presented to the president for his signature.\nA bill to fund the rest of the government through Sept. 30, following an agreement between Republicans and Democrats that had been stalled in the House in the middle of the week, was approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate by a vote of 93-2.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of here. If everybody can just have their seatbelts on and start their engines, the plan is to go to Washington DC for the final approval by the president,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden told reporters.\nThe bill had remained in a coma in the House on Tuesday, with Democrats not offering time for any possible reconciliation of amendments with the spending bill already passed by the Senate. Democrats on Tuesday refused to take up the bipartisan government funding bill.\nWith the bipartisan legislation that clears the way for a final vote to proceed Wednesday, a vote scheduled by congressional leaders to start at 7 a.m. ET (2100 GMT) will likely have little impact.\nLawmakers are expected to vote on additional bills on top of the federal government funding and spending bill to make the vote effective.\nThe agreement provides for the continuation of the sequester that has put the government at risk for shuttering to expire on Sept. 30.\n\u201cThe sequester may have stopped at the end of July, but America\u2019s priorities have not,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, who led negotiations, said.\nRepublicans in Congress have been divided on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration from Central America, but now support it.\nObama signed a suspension of deportations of illegal immigrants who crossed the border between Mexico and the U.S. during the previous fiscal year. However it appears that the deal will include a mechanism to prevent deportations for those who have been granted refugee status, something some conservatives have sought.\nIn a statement in New York, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that the Senate and House were able to reach a compromise on immigration.\n\u201cThis is a bipartisan agreement that would help provide temporary relief from deportations until a serious strategy on immigration is formulated, with our borders secured,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThis is a step to put our country\u2019s immigration system in order and to establish a path to citizenship for all of our people.\u201d","token_len":600,"entropy":[3.6707,1.4879,4.1883,0.0016,0.0422,0.1786,3.2983,8.5578,1.1435,0.8128,1.5412,4.4064,4.3709,1.9656,1.9548,1.4651,5.7022,0.2555,0.0081,0.0273,6.9013,3.2406,4.235,0.2676,1.378,1.2037,3.9967,2.2537,5.0905,0.6677,1.6453,0.279,0.4282,3.9905,7.4034,0.213,0.7695,1.941,0.7579,1.5292,0.0365,0.3783,0.1944,25.9557,3.239,1.2914,2.6787,0.7063,5.7591,2.8346,0.5405,0.0084,1.6029,1.9145,0.9383,2.3722,6.3546,0.3035,0.2027,1.781,1.3104,3.1382,3.2044,1.6472,6.6391,0.7242,3.633,1.4685,6.7879,1.2728,2.9255,7.1256,0.5652,2.6832,1.0354,1.8046,2.2878,1.1224,4.9546,0.8935,1.8789,1.9367,3.4009,4.848,0.1578,13.7009,3.239,3.6186,0.0559,1.7636,0.0014,4.7098,0.5494,6.4737,0.0367,0.249,1.338,1.014,3.7544,4.8188,0.7328,0.0636,7.9812,2.0646,1.7896,0.9618,4.6388,5.0876,3.7949,3.6177,0.5072,4.5065,0.0048,2.0538,5.612,1.4579,1.2388,0.1419,4.1726,2.697,5.3126,0.2099,1.2947,0.2084,1.4421,1.1074,0.0055,1.1284,0.3725,5.547,3.9604,1.756,2.4737,0.6613,6.7531,0.0481,0.1952,1.1639,2.4501,3.7606,0.0026,0.3074,2.1677,6.8328,3.5208,2.6729,1.6077,2.4908,0.1126,0.2057,3.7809,4.5408,0.8724,2.8274,1.7198,0.535,1.0268,4.2321,1.3145,5.8727,0.0076,0.4838,3.8703,0.1923,2.1945,2.657,0.9216,0.9605,5.1396,0.2633,0.4311,0.8618,2.3815,0.3493,1.1042,0.02,5.0114,0.3475,2.7667,0.436,0.3274,11.3083,8.9487,9.6105,12.0528,12.2472,3.2358,7.3312,0.7303,3.136,1.4668,5.0446,8.014,3.7755,5.0465,5.0093,2.5554,7.8937,10.5525,0.0031,2.1895,1.6891,5.9094,5.0725,4.9279,1.1765,3.3348,5.306,1.3587,2.7708,3.1159,1.7314,3.8864,6.3522,3.1527,1.4337,3.0685,5.393,4.4393,0.6196,1.4259,2.1662,6.3946,7.6947,10.6734,0.0139,0.3496,0.0021,2.3967,0.3167,1.5965,0.4003,1.7159,3.4915,4.4354,5.8565,1.2465,4.5047,8.1417,3.5611,0.3183,0.8527,4.2055,1.5596,1.1515,1.7924,2.7923,5.1479,5.4743,9.0755,1.1907,3.5862,5.6062,3.4788,5.2556,6.3878,4.3978,1.3749,9.1162,0.7857,8.309,3.2434,1.196,0.2852,1.5931,0.5615,4.0904,3.8618,2.171,4.2163,0.0708,3.8753,1.2321,0.9499,6.6648,6.7768,1.6482,0.7125,2.2772,0.2093,4.9947,1.3217,5.5761,3.6866,5.2608,6.6047,0.2062,0.2326,0.1685,2.051,0.8849,0.3121,4.8221,3.327,6.4163,0.1979,3.6739,3.9166,7.3363,5.0767,7.2594,1.2629,3.2684,4.968,3.4734,3.2977,1.3545,0.0002,0.0001,0.1049,2.6927,4.5587,5.5146,1.3073,0.0889,0.2592,2.8191,3.0627,4.2463,2.7948,1.1494,2.3294,0.6491,6.8155,0.0147,2.4614,1.1933,0.024,2.2032,0.552,7.0565,2.9124,2.1353,8.0457,0.0134,0.47,6.4489,0.9953,2.6639,6.7303,3.3575,1.2361,4.1061,3.3847,2.0977,5.3572,5.9696,2.5461,0.5975,1.932,4.6696,5.5268,1.4987,1.7648,4.4748,0.0309,0.828,5.1093,0.0004,3.8172,1.7397,5.7356,1.2787,1.9874,2.7759,1.7488,1.9558,7.4211,0.2369,5.9582,7.694,2.5769,1.6498,0.0039,0.1038,0.6883,0.8711,2.2067,0.7903,1.9268,2.5763,0.003,6.3138,2.4952,4.2531,3.5623,1.6835,0.8741,0.0466,3.0947,0.8713,0.7153,9.0285,5.5832,3.3649,0.7685,6.8007,2.518,2.5659,4.2541,0.7026,1.7088,4.6255,0.8208,0.5818,0.0213,2.688,3.5207,3.4433,4.1795,2.8633,0.8401,2.7229,0.4068,4.9679,3.0374,1.6901,1.4274,1.8931,5.3839,1.7154,6.3877,1.2917,0.0025,5.875,1.9901,0.0674,5.2051,1.4524,1.1792,1.6979,4.9891,3.2738,0.4747,1.4037,2.8691,5.6423,5.322,3.7425,1.4497,0.7482,5.2365,3.1634,1.7034,10.3483,0.3813,4.469,0.0017,1.6689,3.5374,0.1274,2.3356,3.9548,0.0945,1.1543,5.5932,3.4725,0.0235,0.0124,1.388,0.0006,0.0011,0.4367,3.8934,0.8733,3.9868,1.3741,0.0123,1.1412,5.0602,8.0631,5.5063,1.2226,1.5873,5.8786,2.0613,5.4235,1.7197,6.1191,0.6155,3.7503,3.2643,0.0036,3.4244,1.3981,0.6149,1.9353,1.3581,4.1116,3.7563,0.015,2.0695,3.9548,4.1646,3.3568,1.5231,5.9454,1.5769,0.2455,3.689,1.1453,0.8762,5.8781,5.2306,0.1065,0.4605,3.6812,0.567,0.0515,0.6356,0.0081,1.0841,0.5397,0.0082,0.0056,0.0098,0.4733,2.4022,1.3114,2.2458,4.0159,0.1235,3.1218,3.8807,0.0118,1.4794,0.5702,2.0241,1.5364,2.781,2.6757,0.3396,1.3278,0.1022,3.957,1.1422,1.2761,3.3105,0.8321,1.5321,4.1527,3.4939,5.0397,6.1514,0.5717,2.4983,7.7659,0.0123,5.0593,3.1124,6.0856,8.1474,4.8008,2.6532,1.0251,4.2294,1.4851,6.1484,6.0137,7.3685,2.8117,1.0358,1.6274,1.1675,0.2976,0.315,0.3328,4.6867,0.2371,2.6191,1.0449,0.7333,4.3909,3.3635,4.4884,2.1765,1.3014,7.252,0.8674,0.0337,5.9945,1.0188,2.0856,2.2975,1.9086,1.9645,5.8847,0.6877,1.7603,0.5343,0.2411,0.4506,1.1673,2.1774,0.4654,2.312,0.9079,1.1608,1.9876]}

Senate. In Texas, transgender people are discriminated against by law in the bathroom system where not only they are denied to use those facilities with the name that correspond to their gender identity, but also they are not recognized as \u2018people who have a legal right to use the facility \u2018, according to the Texas Public Opinion Foundation. The Foundation reports also in an article that according to the University of Austin\u2019s Center for Gender and Health, gender dysphoria in Texas alone costs the state more than $100 million per year. That\u2019s about $640 per person, according to a June 2017 report from the Center. So far, this year alone, the Texas Human Rights Commission has received more than 1,500 complaints on whether a gender dysphoria patient receives his or her treatment.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Tuesday that the United States will move forward with tariffs on China of 10 percent to 25 percent on other Chinese goods, and a 10 percent to 25 percent on Chinese imports. The move followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on China for $301 billion of products this week in response to China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong, the imposition of a digital tax and trade, and intellectual property violations. China responded strongly to the decision, with Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian saying in a statement Tuesday that Washington had become \u201coverly hostile and arrogant,\u201d and that if China were to impose tariffs, Washington would pay a price. Beijing\u2019s move comes a day after the United States launched retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum, which China also has already threatened.\nI\u2019m an Australian who has been living in Spain for 7 years now. I have been thinking I could try and find someone to start up a business with on eBay. I haven\u2019t found anyone that can understand me. I am not a professional photographer etc so my stuff doesn\u2019t sell very well.\nMy girlfriend has done that and there were lots of people who said they were interested. Some were very interested. But none actually said they were going to buy from me.\nThe fact you have made it over the seas to come and start a business in our lovely country is no mean feat. Wish you the best of luck with this adventure. In the meantime, keep us updated with your progress and perhaps some pix of the stuff you come up with, it sounds like you have a lot of good ideas.\nI'm interested in learning more about your project and what type of sales you are looking for. I live in the New York area, and my business interests are more centered around technology. I would like to start a website and sell products online. I am looking for someone who has been doing this for a while.","token_len":600,"entropy":[10.3951,10.3425,2.7555,4.1661,3.8452,3.9556,7.4483,4.7153,0.9488,11.3906,7.3831,8.813,6.4066,0.083,1.7083,4.0803,2.1392,1.6828,3.1461,1.4942,12.6696,2.2684,1.4122,1.6722,2.4644,1.6972,2.9307,6.2835,0.007,3.1503,6.9749,1.2271,5.7649,3.4837,0.061,0.4368,5.171,7.6513,5.8996,7.8597,0.3137,4.4425,1.0795,1.2904,5.8332,0.0654,2.0617,3.4928,2.4064,2.4489,3.9239,5.1449,5.5857,8.8399,0.5221,3.838,0.7159,2.8667,7.5707,0.428,6.0932,0.9091,7.7592,1.4372,5.2056,4.1427,5.6224,0.7211,0.2108,0.529,0.3696,0.3843,0.1075,0.7495,3.0768,0.3871,3.682,5.348,0.6946,15.8293,4.7326,9.4193,3.2707,2.0772,2.2462,3.0804,0.1467,0.1509,0.8669,1.2431,3.9266,2.1288,0.8306,6.4561,3.0091,0.0015,0.8526,1.4695,4.2559,6.2552,5.081,0.4965,2.0597,3.5384,3.6802,8.1912,5.3886,3.644,1.7656,1.3368,6.6958,0.0023,1.1593,5.9366,0.044,6.0275,8.2445,2.8048,0.6566,3.717,0.0913,2.2517,1.525,3.627,1.5204,4.7411,2.3604,0.0723,3.7285,0.6049,9.0689,5.494,1.018,0.1243,2.6083,0.0728,0.0533,2.9115,0.8996,1.6784,0.026,0.9377,5.018,8.7692,0.5248,0.4876,3.8626,0.9782,7.5753,2.4667,1.275,1.9531,1.9986,0.0029,2.7806,5.7304,2.9831,1.3526,1.3619,0.2758,1.2913,2.8664,5.7761,2.909,0.5844,4.4378,1.8661,2.6329,0.3002,0.9199,2.6321,4.4365,0.1884,0.0896,0.3659,4.4974,1.4161,0.0279,2.6124,0.1272,1.9469,0.4897,4.5087,6.1355,2.8106,4.6175,3.1647,1.08,4.1386,6.0964,6.4131,0.2164,0.0028,4.6062,2.2388,1.6703,18.6105,1.4975,1.4998,0.6647,0.0034,0.0,4.5721,2.7764,0.2839,0.897,3.7047,0.0154,1.1579,4.9707,1.6069,0.4276,9.3377,0.3827,4.6939,6.9366,4.8541,0.5151,2.6553,3.3379,0.0141,1.1533,6.8469,3.3115,0.5702,1.8326,2.6506,3.7272,2.7733,0.2345,2.3102,1.7542,0.0211,3.1246,3.951,2.4213,1.3574,1.6904,1.5214,5.1552,3.2511,0.6121,0.0205,4.3829,0.2213,0.0264,1.8034,0.5069,2.8598,1.1701,0.1187,2.2664,1.964,5.362,11.4527,0.1586,2.9307,4.4297,5.0677,2.9225,3.8301,1.4752,0.0029,2.1575,5.8792,0.0843,0.0814,4.8174,0.06,7.275,0.0132,2.5372,2.9074,8.1731,0.0434,1.4944,9.0908,4.3131,2.7989,4.8401,6.6567,0.2709,10.7902,0.0061,5.4798,1.0395,4.721,5.2684,5.483,1.1245,0.7865,3.3846,1.3356,3.873,3.9576,4.1701,0.4709,0.4782,5.8682,4.9624,0.7864,2.839,1.3239,1.8939,0.2002,0.3132,3.8206,0.6555,5.5021,3.2418,6.8227,10.2805,4.2436,6.3094,4.37,5.1541,2.9576,5.8279,3.604,2.9943,7.8159,1.1495,1.1993,5.4466,2.4532,2.0175,0.1882,2.9787,1.1038,1.9963,3.0249,0.2453,5.5438,1.411,2.1489,0.7313,6.1229,3.7681,0.0248,0.1038,4.1653,3.3433,3.2877,0.4175,0.1075,1.2886,1.6384,0.1202,4.6846,4.1233,0.0022,4.2401,0.9511,6.4101,1.4744,1.4124,2.1939,3.0928,3.7998,4.5673,3.046,5.1565,5.0189,2.8158,1.1289,6.4166,5.0342,0.7738,1.4799,5.465,5.1882,2.2637,2.217,1.1936,1.6869,0.4806,7.5392,0.5296,5.8756,0.4357,2.936,1.5341,1.0959,1.8525,1.4999,5.9834,6.6413,3.6312,4.8194,2.3192,2.5209,4.1008,1.4301,5.4733,5.4157,0.5431,1.4238,3.0154,5.1708,7.3236,1.1572,1.2247,5.075,2.3027,0.5359,0.0044,0.843,0.9301,3.0882,2.9742,5.6666,2.2663,1.0144,0.9484,3.0515,2.6316,1.8288,4.6049,4.8615,9.7604,4.6134,3.6815,8.4251,3.7005,0.8671,0.2027,0.3176,5.6236,3.3978,0.0251,0.798,3.0788,3.7524,4.5215,2.3703,5.4112,5.1852,3.0549,5.3607,4.1353,3.8437,0.0234,1.5024,1.4296,2.929,1.7857,1.8791,3.4221,2.4001,4.7726,2.907,2.6954,2.8865,1.4757,2.6853,4.7195,6.5693,3.3715,0.952,0.961,2.1932,0.0643,1.7732,4.512,0.4073,0.5682,1.8953,3.6407,4.2355,5.5544,2.009,5.2489,1.8451,5.2873,2.07,9.6457,2.4464,4.9458,2.7117,3.7704,0.7458,0.1507,3.269,6.1149,7.5469,1.047,1.3181,5.2882,5.4782,0.0183,0.4076,11.3069,1.8199,2.8269,0.1174,1.7324,0.0016,2.6921,3.2937,5.1394,0.6941,5.8532,1.4701,0.5538,0.3106,4.8294,6.2722,1.985,2.1262,1.8538,3.1932,1.6732,8.3189,3.9671,8.7213,4.6964,2.0982,3.0568,5.4189,0.5365,4.7569,1.2245,0.0149,3.7878,5.4237,6.0209,1.2425,1.2638,1.8499,1.6806,1.7879,0.5144,4.5421,0.5374,1.215,0.9754,2.5395,3.0946,4.6255,0.5261,3.382,0.4926,0.1239,2.3559,4.7969,1.3558,2.1952,6.9104,0.0233,7.3526,1.0565,1.814,2.6009,0.4659,0.6962,1.8042,6.8379,0.1868,2.221,6.3508,0.6509,0.4103,2.1114,1.752,3.0915,4.4294,4.0176,0.9275,4.4142,4.7553,1.3469,4.4768,1.8467,1.2519,3.0646,1.3732,0.0786,2.2245,1.299,4.2209,2.4624,3.3622,2.912,3.0116,1.1885,1.3225,2.6675,2.0173,0.3872,3.2264,0.8247,2.2502,3.0517,2.7618,1.4881,0.2643,1.2567,1.1862,1.6691]}

They needed some help, but no one else in the NFL's largest market came in the door.\nAnd as the investigation enters its most critical part, it appears that any help would still be a gift from abroad.\n\"Whoever did it obviously knew the person well,\" Paterson City Councilman Omar Alborondo said before the city announced it was shutting down social media sites like Twitter and Snapchat. \"The investigation is really, really hard.\"\n\"It is a tough time here in Paterson,\" said Jets owner Joe Douglas, a Democrat, who added that while he couldn't go into exact detail, he \"would not rule out the possibility\" of a domestic act of terrorism. \"We have a very strong faith that no act of terrorism will have the ability to cause our city any injury.\"\nEven the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, who was in Minnesota, expressed outrage over the violent attack on the Jets.\nIt comes two days after former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accused the White House of turning a blind eye to the Jets' security concerns because he is a friend of Donald Trump.\nThe Jets have hired their own investigators to figure out why it appeared the murder weapons were inside a suitcase that landed in the Jets' locker room.\nThe police commissioner, Bill Bratton, said he feared for the safety of anyone who might be present in the next 10 days.\nThe suspect was captured in a shopping mall in Paterson in about 40 minutes while walking through the mall wearing a long black overcoat and a blue baseball hat, New York police officers said.\nThe officers initially thought the suspect was an alien because the store clerk asked for his I.D. when he tried to take the suitcase and was told he did not have one.\n\"He wasn't a tourist,\" a police officer who requested anonymy told The Washington Post. \"He was local.\"\nThere are only two Muslims in a 50-million-person city and the suspect might have been thinking about his own religion rather than the Jets.\nThe police officers at the crime scene were not told about their Muslim neighbor, who appeared to have been working outside the mall at the time of the attack.\nA Muslim lawyer representing the suspect, who is not on probation, said he would plead no contest to a crime he did not commit.\n\"He said it must be my fault. I must have done something wrong and that must have motivated him to do it,\" said his lawyer, Abdul Aziz al-Hashimi.\nAl-Hashimi said his client planned on leaving the United States for Kuwait early Tuesday and did not recognize the Jets or any Jets player when he saw the attackers.","token_len":601,"entropy":[5.6958,7.0832,9.6612,0.2959,2.0208,6.7119,0.9481,0.5833,4.8849,4.4748,0.2237,1.8752,4.7125,7.6956,6.4082,6.3186,0.0039,0.1782,1.4691,6.0634,2.8434,4.2124,2.8759,10.056,0.0213,3.2489,2.629,3.2751,1.1388,0.8408,2.0575,10.1197,2.8693,0.5297,4.7356,0.9064,7.1298,1.3449,4.2174,3.7065,0.3358,0.4783,12.6411,3.5047,5.4193,0.5439,4.5406,4.941,0.0652,3.4003,1.7556,0.9917,2.3723,4.6528,1.3833,4.129,6.0807,4.604,0.8101,2.7713,2.2256,3.9255,0.5291,4.3531,3.2456,0.4494,1.8931,5.2036,6.3721,4.1396,4.3997,3.9806,4.1287,5.0026,0.3923,0.5101,4.1965,3.905,1.6657,4.0463,6.7005,0.1861,5.4541,3.4224,4.9326,0.3427,2.1051,4.1231,1.5244,5.8264,4.4598,2.5972,6.3603,0.7337,3.3724,6.0871,1.6392,8.5289,0.2452,0.2989,1.4092,7.0677,2.0288,1.6554,6.9907,2.8328,2.43,4.2889,6.3744,0.7241,3.7013,0.0015,3.9911,1.194,0.4598,8.5894,4.5645,5.3551,9.1383,0.547,5.2703,0.6785,6.1522,4.8503,2.2099,1.1742,4.7413,0.1126,8.6087,0.7382,2.4806,3.9153,1.1736,0.5941,4.306,0.6807,0.649,3.1939,5.261,0.7702,5.3388,3.3191,0.0578,3.966,2.2144,0.0489,3.7287,2.1651,2.8075,1.9512,3.9312,2.5408,4.8818,1.7078,0.5877,0.0006,1.1413,1.0512,6.6986,1.7156,7.2088,14.2474,0.8281,2.936,2.5504,2.9842,1.2884,4.3364,0.6111,4.8586,1.0437,4.5511,0.0003,6.0125,0.4943,5.6902,3.2517,1.1658,0.8043,4.1756,1.8182,2.8089,3.3853,0.7299,1.9234,0.1193,1.9251,0.7292,1.9641,6.5364,5.5419,2.8065,0.7739,0.5304,1.4602,1.8789,2.0653,1.701,2.3882,2.4082,5.8195,1.8971,4.4204,4.7609,0.1248,0.4485,1.9968,4.3452,2.2267,3.6433,0.0397,3.4291,4.7277,0.9687,2.0235,5.8785,1.0329,0.0489,4.6591,2.8639,5.3831,1.6897,0.5617,0.1363,0.3568,0.3564,0.0018,0.0406,2.9556,2.6156,2.4036,4.9175,2.7862,4.0456,4.8917,1.8972,0.2699,7.4763,2.7987,1.6723,0.9685,0.7802,1.0503,0.5598,5.7674,4.9231,4.4395,0.5379,0.1929,4.6379,1.4523,0.38,1.8505,2.8689,0.6226,4.7575,1.0883,6.0164,0.0019,0.1335,5.6118,0.4704,0.0249,0.0012,0.148,0.948,4.2711,0.931,6.5794,3.413,4.1608,2.8584,3.912,1.5504,4.6672,0.3297,4.8088,0.0213,0.6332,0.6131,2.24,2.9399,2.0628,5.3076,4.7894,0.3368,4.7506,1.0491,5.2945,0.0286,2.4454,4.5384,6.3652,1.7919,5.6823,6.6153,0.7355,6.2067,2.2558,5.1358,2.9619,6.3406,0.9683,1.0674,2.85,0.2316,3.0306,0.0446,0.9587,0.9113,1.6528,5.0149,5.9595,0.8701,3.0051,0.0468,0.0009,0.0436,1.2165,2.24,5.8194,1.6237,1.1101,0.5231,0.025,6.2725,1.187,2.0623,1.6374,5.5534,1.9037,0.2992,7.8174,4.6047,0.9757,0.7711,0.5466,2.4427,4.9089,1.9929,5.0815,2.3015,1.5884,7.7337,0.6847,1.2412,3.1162,0.0002,3.4534,6.584,4.7769,0.2631,5.3492,4.2035,2.7772,0.8194,3.5019,4.6938,0.6898,5.555,1.4124,8.231,0.1347,1.0937,1.6352,3.3494,3.2715,2.197,1.8463,5.8332,1.8255,1.9054,5.6289,0.3512,0.3091,0.8194,1.5665,5.4057,6.0507,2.126,1.0264,0.6766,0.6814,3.5654,7.0526,4.9631,2.3398,5.4475,3.1399,4.9844,2.7283,2.1157,9.8971,0.2995,0.3843,0.3598,4.1513,0.7744,3.9895,0.0344,3.8111,2.026,3.8185,3.1681,2.8575,1.5121,1.8981,4.1774,0.0285,0.4142,1.7469,0.5146,0.8512,2.7665,1.9535,4.3485,0.0005,2.3061,4.6787,1.378,3.5858,0.6769,0.9589,1.876,5.1439,8.2894,18.538,4.7341,2.0268,1.541,3.5663,0.0389,0.3958,0.7772,0.6325,0.5241,7.3767,1.3285,0.1194,5.6124,2.4992,4.2973,2.2469,8.5527,0.388,5.8472,6.8519,0.1847,4.5953,0.2155,1.7609,1.0384,2.1321,1.8857,3.6773,5.4136,0.6726,1.0121,6.7715,1.2335,3.0804,3.0378,3.0445,5.7849,0.0157,1.9531,3.437,1.6061,0.5649,1.6289,3.3807,3.2688,5.2366,0.2493,4.6528,0.0338,2.6555,2.1042,4.2765,2.0165,4.4692,5.6644,4.4843,1.5813,1.3025,5.5159,0.3732,1.5126,0.9299,4.8939,4.186,0.9298,2.4813,2.8234,0.5899,0.0869,0.7045,0.0282,1.4584,0.4121,0.6437,3.6522,4.8877,6.6192,2.8126,0.4221,2.2267,2.1314,2.2448,2.3336,2.1379,4.7785,5.5795,0.5732,0.8859,1.1506,3.314,4.9785,2.7867,0.0007,0.4507,1.8335,4.9038,1.4247,1.7243,0.0293,0.0071,0.5636,0.6156,1.2608,2.4284,4.3904,3.5693,6.2023,1.4209,5.1294,2.6265,2.7465,1.5227,5.5277,1.6529,2.3562,0.6889,0.4053,3.0282,2.9634,3.8051,1.3224,6.5205,0.9446,0.962,0.9031,0.5197,0.2115,1.667,4.213,0.6659,0.2376,4.7152,3.2895,0.0287,3.0473,0.2042,6.4754,0.2759,0.4451,0.4721,5.1001,0.4606,0.0087,0.0003,0.8868,2.8923,0.0543,6.3281,3.122,3.4978,1.0387,2.7295,0.0139,2.4434,7.5697,5.9985,3.8625,2.7591,4.9178,0.0432,5.8077,1.0241,3.0049,2.8676,2.4742,5.8345,4.5806,3.7371,0.5102,3.4671,1.4687,7.4791,0.8366]}

(Photo by YURI CORTEZ \/ AFP)\nS. WEDNESDAY, Feb. 2, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As part of an agreement signed Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2009, with The Boeing Company, the United Automobile Workers of America (UAW) is to become an \u201cintegrated supplier\" to the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. The union also has signed to be an integrated supplier with United Technologies Corporation (UTC).\n\u201cThe UAW will have the ability, with Boeing, to compete with UTC for the same jobs on the same plants, and will work more closely with Boeing to enhance our business with UTC,\u201d said Dr. Robert W. Trapp, UAW Executive Vice President and President of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \u201cThe UAW and Boeing are both leaders in aviation, and with the combined resources of the two unions, this will benefit employees and their families while enhancing the quality and availability of the 787 Dreamliner throughout the industry.\u201d\nAt an April 2009 meeting with President Barack Obama, Boeing and the UAW came to a basic agreement under which the union has agreed to produce and deliver the 787 under the UAW's standard work rules. The agreement was reached by Boeing senior management and UAW local UAW-7, the largest UAW unit with more than 10,000 members in the aircraft industry, primarily at Westland plant in Michigan and at Seattle South plant at Boeing Field. The agreement was implemented without disruption in UAW-7 operations. Boeing will continue to provide for the UAW with a fair and equitable pay and benefit system. Boeing also will continue funding the union's pension and health care benefits.\nThe agreement allows integration of UAW-7 with the Boeing Enterprise Resource Planning system, with UAW-7's personnel staff and benefits managed on a corporate computer system. The UAW also will have the ability to provide on-the-job training to all new members of the company's workforce.

{"prompt":"Austria is set to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government after the anti-immigration Freedom Party and Sebastian Kurz s conservatives struck a coalition deal to share power almost equally","text":"Austria is set to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government after the anti-immigration Freedom Party and Sebastian Kurz s conservatives struck a coalition deal to share power almost equally.\nUnder a national system that has given Germany, France and Austria more of a vote on Europe, the result gives Austria's conservative government a majority in parliament.\nThe bloc's centre-left leader Sigmar Gabriel welcomed the deal but also expressed concern about the potential influence of the new administration on EU politics.\n\"The coalition represents a more right-wing, nationalistic bloc,\" he told local radio.\n\"That does not augur very well for our efforts to get things done in the European Parliament and across European Union countries.\"\nGermany and Austria share a long history of tension, with a string of wars, economic tensions and migration politics.\nKurz, 33, became chancellor after winning the October 2015 elections on the promise to cut the country's bloated bureaucracy and reform the social security system to make it payable for as long as you live.\nDespite promising more than he actually delivered, voters have forgiven the young but brash populist, who was elected on a platform of tax cuts and more freedom to shop and travel.\nHe has pledged to ban Muslim immigration and vowed that, if elected, he would renegotiate European Union treaties that have been at the core of his far-right policies.\nAustrians, however, say they are not about to be ruled by any foreign leader.\nThe far-right Freedom Party is tipped to come within a few hundred vote points of the centre-left Social Democrats in next week's elections.\nAustralian Greens MP Adam Bandt said he was deeply disappointed that one of his country's best friends and allies, Austria's President, had become a supporter of right-wing populism.\n\"The decision of the President is a strong statement of support for our friends in Austria. The far right can expect further support from the leaders of our major European ally,\" Mr Bandt said in a statement.\nAustrians overwhelmingly say they would not support a right-wing government or any candidate sympathetic to the far-right in the future, with 90 per cent saying they would never vote for the Freedom Party in September's ballot.\nPosted 5 NovNovember 2016FriFriday 5 NovNovember

{"prompt":"The United States threatened on Tuesday to take further action against the South Sudan government if it does not end violence and allow United Nations peacekeepers to do their job , but U.N. sanctions are","text":"The United States threatened on Tuesday to take further action against the South Sudan government if it does not end violence and allow United Nations peacekeepers to do their job, but U.N. sanctions are unlikely to hit President Salva Kiir's government soon.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry in talks with the chairman of the United Nations Security Council.\nAt his briefing, Kerry said he had \"extremely respectful\" conversations with the chairman of the Security Council on Monday, after the United States threatened on Tuesday to take further legal action if the South Sudan government did not end violence and allow United Nations peacekeepers to do their job.\nSudanese President Omar al-Bashir faces criminal and sanctions threats from Sudan and the West for the alleged massacre of thousands of ethnic Uru in the nation's south in 2005.\n\"The discussions with the (Security Council) were really positive,\" Kerry said. \"The Security Council is working together,\" adding there is a \"common approach on several issues.\"\nBut he said the United States wanted to \"raise specific concerns about the ongoing violence across South Sudan.\"\nThe U.S. embassy in Juba had said the U.S. would consider further legal action in response to President Kiir's \"complete disregard for U.N. resolutions and his violations of international law, including the use of force against civilian populations.\"\n\"The United States strongly condemns the indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian institutions by all South Sudanese armed actors. The United States strongly urges all parties to strictly enforce U.N. and international humanitarian law,\" the statement added.\nThe killing of hundreds of civilians in Juba and the northern Kordofan state in the past week were the latest in a new wave of fighting in South Sudan which has seen dozens of deaths and millions displaced.\nIt is unclear how much the escalating violence might spill over from South Sudan to Sudan.\nU.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said it was the Security Council's concern -- rather than U.S. threats -- that caused Sudanese President al-Bashir to suspend the two men he met with on Tuesday who have ties to the rebel group.\n\"There are a lot of people in Sudan who have links to the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A) but they are not involved in crimes that have to do with a genocide. This means they have to wait until the end of the investigation. Some of them have been granted amnesty,\" Nesirky said.\nAl-Bashir has been accused by rights groups of masterminding the massacre, an accusation he denies in a statement Tuesday saying it was \"absolute and complete fabrication.\"\nSudan's top lawyer Ahmad Ibrahim has also rejected any links between the SPLM and the atrocities.\nBut the U.N. has accused Bashir of being responsible for the deaths of more than 700 civilians from the ethnic Uru group last month.","token_len":602,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,8.9653,4.8276,2.7788,0.5635,3.5208,4.7291,0.5651,0.6672,2.2631,5.9984,4.2117,4.5584,1.5738,0.5029,2.8133,0.0103,3.6782,4.6342,2.4208,4.3136,6.5012,0.0398,0.7074,0.2435,0.2109,5.1717,0.5981,1.3506,1.8394,3.5235,3.8901,0.0014,1.1912,0.0203,6.8944,2.2789,3.1687,0.0189,5.3501,5.5553,2.5367,0.0008,0.0001,0.0053,0.6599,1.3043,4.0374,0.6439,0.3212,20.2128,1.779,0.0046,0.0044,0.117,0.0045,5.7857,5.8998,0.2201,2.601,7.975,0.0191,0.2305,2.5514,0.0833,1.301,0.0009,5.1033,2.2338,5.52,4.2201,5.1233,1.48,1.1109,0.8207,2.0523,2.2717,2.5998,7.7581,8.5788,0.564,4.2234,0.0465,1.3521,5.9694,0.2569,0.0647,0.5852,0.0013,3.1648,3.2846,1.3296,3.8189,1.8003,1.9531,0.279,4.0803,1.6878,0.0605,0.0125,0.0069,0.0103,11.4521,0.187,1.7417,1.9788,1.0131,0.0543,0.3217,1.5267,0.0105,0.3318,0.2757,0.3281,0.0645,0.8724,0.1462,0.0004,0.0066,0.0075,0.0063,0.0021,0.0087,0.4458,0.1952,4.8829,0.4746,0.0008,3.5684,0.5318,2.7279,0.4747,0.0074,0.0531,0.0007,0.0041,5.9547,5.4196,5.9086,7.1461,7.4223,1.3872,4.0148,3.7052,1.6129,3.8661,1.9829,2.9716,4.2381,5.3313,0.1581,3.22,0.0969,3.1041,4.9038,10.1043,8.8469,1.9627,5.624,0.5437,3.376,1.7693,4.8244,0.4083,0.5374,3.2258,2.0025,8.6467,2.4356,0.528,6.5728,6.8191,0.0065,0.4246,3.4476,5.3194,2.6819,1.4069,0.2779,0.4138,0.6715,0.8924,2.2293,2.7888,0.0013,1.8889,3.6055,4.0652,7.1853,4.4788,4.638,2.1707,2.0348,0.792,5.0481,5.2808,4.8628,6.5208,0.8911,1.3487,0.1093,3.9887,1.7897,1.0287,1.4655,1.6215,0.0745,5.1569,0.3677,2.516,6.6797,6.7071,1.7305,1.6708,0.9323,4.7096,2.5882,5.9339,2.7739,0.0277,1.3179,0.1299,2.3046,2.3814,0.001,0.3025,0.1448,5.6924,0.3366,5.4578,0.0009,4.2522,2.655,2.2465,2.0083,0.0022,0.1924,0.0725,2.2664,4.3713,3.9018,1.668,0.1601,3.6143,1.7948,0.1275,5.2729,0.3815,0.001,0.048,4.3118,7.1477,1.2353,0.6733,5.6187,0.0042,0.2297,0.0356,2.819,1.3714,4.5048,6.5106,0.0989,0.7911,0.3261,3.4592,0.9035,0.9789,3.9258,0.0115,0.6866,1.6298,4.4123,0.5045,0.9196,0.141,3.0703,1.5086,1.2976,0.0212,3.3659,1.0203,0.6475,5.3175,0.0013,3.3746,0.3216,0.3882,1.7227,4.9664,4.3245,1.7708,5.1746,4.6477,0.0024,0.0312,2.2642,8.0071,3.3075,1.328,1.042,0.027,2.9523,2.6425,1.9797,0.6609,0.4585,12.1844,2.3415,2.2687,0.001,0.0057,0.0217,2.9866,0.5659,1.9093,0.1571,1.5932,0.9334,2.2624,2.7062,0.0574,0.1362,1.7096,7.2712,0.6572,2.9869,0.063,1.4809,1.0086,3.0558,0.003,3.6906,1.6519,6.7535,5.5914,1.9472,0.1671,0.0913,4.2711,2.3671,2.9252,3.169,2.3674,4.4957,1.5219,1.9111,0.9581,0.1933,8.0444,0.696,0.0087,5.1035,1.4418,1.939,0.0031,4.1062,0.4644,2.3783,4.5085,0.6698,3.7473,1.0737,3.6123,1.5554,0.5073,0.418,5.4649,1.8307,3.5707,1.4032,2.2138,2.0888,6.5238,0.483,4.4434,6.0132,0.2392,4.2017,2.4901,0.0186,1.2692,3.373,1.0572,0.8724,3.4483,0.0084,1.0654,0.0471,3.137,4.1741,2.0088,0.1818,0.1079,0.0912,0.405,3.9714,0.5193,4.0589,6.873,0.0029,0.4356,5.9791,8.2389,5.3162,0.0076,2.8274,0.0005,0.6304,0.2117,4.6753,0.3809,0.2119,7.5565,5.0411,0.8882,1.5104,6.4387,0.0077,0.0063,0.0004,0.0003,0.2662,4.4408,1.9459,6.0649,8.0158,5.0899,4.2052,1.2809,1.5973,1.3144,6.5842,2.7783,4.9028,0.0724,0.9767,5.6938,0.9604,1.3395,0.2018,1.1247,3.1229,1.94,2.7372,1.263,0.0376,2.4186,1.6072,1.9093,0.5439,2.0624,4.3928,0.3198,0.9609,3.8013,0.0711,6.4425,0.0099,0.6792,3.5965,7.4537,4.6831,2.2085,1.4311,0.4165,2.1673,2.85,2.6329,3.7725,1.6946,1.1972,0.9028,3.415,0.1821,6.4296,3.662,2.459,5.4555,0.5216,0.004,4.8322,5.853,2.9909,3.2525,4.9484,2.218,1.7762,1.6484,6.3835,1.7298,1.1838,2.3024,0.1325,0.6669,6.1659,3.4685,6.1831,0.6944,0.9288,1.4799,1.7158,6.1347,1.9274,1.584,0.7334,0.0004,0.001,0.0007,0.1992,0.2873,0.1354,5.7977,0.18,0.0121,0.0099,0.0008,2.3318,1.5612,1.8707,1.6875,5.1152,0.1928,0.2518,7.3199,0.0055,0.0,1.1296,2.4762,1.9543,5.4473,0.8169,1.4812,0.3151,5.9085,1.8297,2.0514,3.9619,5.0379,2.6571,0.3307,2.4173,7.503,2.4412,3.1585,2.3439,0.4851,0.2407,3.5976,0.0906,0.0031,1.8254,4.4351,3.9533,8.2053,4.1433,3.2519,2.9902,5.1151,3.2846,4.9813,0.5964,0.6833,3.1567,0.0139,0.9264,0.6673,5.7615,0.9482,0.2226,4.0597,2.079,2.4255,0.0008,0.4282,0.1386,2.7538,3.9625,6.7303,0.0003,0.3941,3.0543,2.4915,0.089,0.6989,3.1749,0.4022,2.0758,0.0037,4.566,0.7938,5.3917,1.1316,5.2133,1.9776,0.1281,2.5126,4.1887,1.71,1.0438]}
{"prompt":"Russia will supply Turkey with four batteries of S-400 surface-to-air missiles for $ 2.5 billion under a deal that is almost complete , Sergei Chemezov , head of Russian state conglomerate Rostec , told the","text":"Russia will supply Turkey with four batteries of S-400 surface-to-air missiles for $ 2.5 billion under a deal that is almost complete, Sergei Chemezov, head of Russian state conglomerate Rostec, told the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. \u201cWe have discussed it with [ Erdogan ], and now this question lies with him, \u201d Chemezov told Zvezda. \u201c It is not easy to find a buyer. \u201c\nChemezov\u2019s comments come as Russian news agency RIA News reports that Russia and Turkey agreed that four batteries of S-400 surface-to-air missiles will be delivered to Turkey within the next year, RIA News reported. The deal was signed a year ago, and the military equipment is expected to be deployed to the base in Turkey\u2019s Black Sea resort of Tartus later this year. An S-400 interception system consists of four independently navigable, mobile, and automated systems, each with a maximum range of 350 kilometers and a combat envelope of 150 kilometers. The system is capable of detecting up to 14,000 targets at a time and intercepting about six that remain within the target envelope; it can also destroy up to 10 of them at the same time. The missiles have a minimum range of 5 kilometers and a maximum range of 90 kilometers. Chemezov said that at the beginning of negotiations with Ankara, it was expected that the purchase of the S-400 system would cost $ 5 billion.\n\u201cWe understand that when you negotiate for a lot, the price changes over time, \u201d he said, adding that \u201cright now it\u2019s quite obvious that we are doing business for about 3 billion and a half in the end.\u201d Chemezov didn\u2019t say whether his comments meant that the actual purchase cost would be lower, but said the agreement wouldn\u2019t be the subject of negotiations. On March 29, Russia\u2019s defense minister Sergei Shoigu said the Russian parliament had given its blessing to the purchase of eight batteries of the S-400, and the country would continue purchasing more after that.\n\u201cThe agreement was signed at the end of January. Today there are no problems in getting rid of customs procedures and all other issues, \u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to buy this equipment. We\u2019ve already signed two contracts. The S-400 is a long-range air defense system, \u201d says Shoigu.\nThe S-400 system is designed to intercept conventional and cruise missiles and other ballistic missiles flying at speeds between 500 and 5500 kilometers per hour, according to Russian state-run news agency, RIA Novosti. It also could block reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and hypersonic missiles.

Mr. Fischer, who heads the government\u2019s largest party, has insisted on leaving out Mr. Babis of the coalition. On Monday, Mr. Babis said, \u201dwe have been unable to reach a compromise with the centre-left and the centre-right.\u201d Mr. Fischer has also insisted that Mr. Babis cannot be in a position to represent all of the center-right in the coalition.\u201d\nOn Wednesday evening a mob attack on and vandalism at the Czech EU representative office in Brussels brought to light and exacerbated the deep-seated enmity between the Czech Republic and the European Union.

The EU\u2019s ambassador said that he hoped \u201d that this would not happen again. But since this happened, we have to take this very seriously and make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nOn Thursday afternoon Prime Minister Andrej Babis and his coalition partners were unable to secure the confidence vote of the lower house of parliament, the Slovak National Council (SN Czech ANO, Fidesz, Democratic Unionists party) after the ministers in the coalition rejected a revised government proposal that saw no changes in ministries but a more detailed agenda.

{"prompt":"Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili was freed from detention on Monday , after a Ukrainian judge turned down the prosecutors request to place him under house arrest - the latest twist in his dramatic standoff","text":"Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili was freed from detention on Monday, after a Ukrainian judge turned down the prosecutors request to place him under house arrest - the latest twist in his dramatic standoff with President Yulia Timoshenko.\nIn the latest crisis, Timoshenko accused Ukraine's top court on Monday of trying to prevent her from getting a fair trial in her appeal against a recent presidential pardon.\nTimoshenko, who has been confined to her home since the end of February, was allowed to leave under supervision to hold a news conference from her office late on Monday.\nUkrainian president Yulia Timoshenko has said she will leave office when her political opponents succeed in revoking a presidential pardon granted to the former premier.\nHer lawyer says, however, that the president has decided not to file a petition to the parliament to revoke the pardon until she leaves office.\nTimoshenko made the remarks in her hometown of Kyiv, where she was speaking by video link to Ukrainians in the Russian city of Astrakhan.\nPresidential pardons are usually used as a negotiating tool by both the president and his political rivals.\nBut Timoshenko's presidential pardon has been seen as a weak and vulnerable negotiating tool after the first presidential elections in Ukraine, when a scandal involving widespread cheating and a vote-buying campaign led to a dramatic recount, resulting in the ousting of then President Leonid Kuchma.\nIn his statement, Saakashvili accused the judge of trying to prevent her from getting a fair trial and called him \"the chief of the corrupt regime\".\nSaakashvili appealed directly to the President after the courthouse session and his lawyer said there would be consequences if the president did nothing, according to a Reuters report.\nThe judge's office refuted Saakashvili's accusations and said he only appealed to the president because of the \"unusually serious circumstances\".\nAfter Saakashvili's arrest on February 20, Timoshenko had called for sanctions against Georgia.\nThe head of the Supreme Nationality Council in Russia, Vsevolod Gerasimov, said the Saakashvili arrest \"completely broke\" relations between Kiev and Moscow, but hoped that \"important and constructive steps\" would be taken by the Ukrainian authorities.\n\"The question is what will happen now and if the criminal investigation in this case will continue,\" Gerasimov said.\nThe Ukrainian opposition leader says he wants to leave the country and travel to Russia - a move that would be illegal.\nGerasimov said the arrest of Saakashvili was unlikely to bring stability to Ukraine: \"The political situation will be even more complicated if he stays in Ukraine.\"\nTimoshenko has refused to leave Ukraine. She has been forced to resign three times in the past year.\nA former Ukrainian deputy prime minister has been jailed for three years for fraud, but he was released last month after spending a year in prison.","token_len":602,"entropy":[9.0626,0.2429,5.7823,5.4085,5.346,0.2436,0.0034,0.009,0.114,0.0004,0.0025,0.0,3.6006,7.0978,1.6671,3.0697,1.8932,2.3196,1.7953,2.526,2.099,6.0512,3.5026,7.1479,0.1546,2.2302,6.7367,4.1686,0.7065,6.3563,0.2516,1.6323,0.1998,0.0011,7.7292,2.5976,2.4636,2.4402,0.2057,4.0227,6.1923,5.1354,0.1,4.1963,6.6541,0.3968,8.7291,0.012,0.3082,0.375,15.4139,2.1445,2.4295,7.2998,0.8243,5.5102,0.0119,3.298,3.9348,1.3114,3.7686,2.3566,3.8729,1.0601,0.0397,3.0291,0.0649,4.1263,0.9031,0.1935,4.3584,1.6262,1.4557,0.0768,2.4613,2.6609,3.9504,0.8246,0.9911,5.411,5.6223,2.5133,0.7474,0.2352,6.6838,0.0011,1.7558,0.7579,1.7064,1.5439,6.8185,0.8953,2.9844,1.2717,4.4585,2.1616,2.7146,0.0011,3.0316,0.3844,2.4368,4.861,0.2565,1.7257,7.4854,5.191,5.2063,6.6516,1.0941,3.2261,0.0138,5.5965,1.0027,2.6722,5.857,0.4993,0.5952,0.9235,0.3873,4.3187,0.005,0.0257,4.3949,4.5697,0.0196,1.886,0.0067,3.0163,2.9173,0.9149,1.15,4.589,3.0751,5.1232,2.1662,4.3021,1.5152,5.279,1.9254,6.0267,1.3825,2.316,0.9707,0.0424,4.0634,0.8521,3.031,1.1609,4.1866,1.458,1.4713,3.3624,3.2945,4.1819,6.2839,0.6007,0.0046,0.198,1.6541,3.2326,2.3306,4.3907,1.7359,0.0025,5.5713,1.0164,3.8555,1.4422,3.8435,5.2803,1.4976,3.9013,0.4785,0.44,5.7465,1.6837,3.9532,0.124,0.5814,0.2268,3.8586,0.001,5.812,1.4255,3.2814,1.5029,2.3513,6.1974,0.1239,3.6525,0.001,1.1156,1.0589,0.3785,1.8575,5.6247,4.6208,2.5082,0.1284,1.7742,7.7255,2.2304,1.732,5.7937,2.571,0.0446,5.3101,0.7601,0.0001,0.9076,0.2475,6.3443,4.5116,1.3498,0.1127,1.4155,3.2609,4.0318,3.0535,0.3552,6.727,0.5238,4.1477,2.7835,3.9842,4.121,0.0684,1.9099,2.4388,3.2472,1.5991,0.5767,2.5719,3.6704,0.0004,1.3261,7.0905,1.0386,1.8625,1.4783,3.5419,0.4371,0.7264,6.1358,3.4585,5.9479,4.8611,0.4128,4.0154,1.8301,5.2138,4.2553,2.3721,0.6446,3.6723,2.6967,2.0343,3.3901,7.8008,2.7191,7.826,4.7431,1.5489,3.3616,5.5099,1.0378,1.4287,0.0022,3.6762,2.167,0.1515,1.7689,4.6825,6.2627,3.7929,4.7586,0.0029,1.483,3.5752,1.1234,0.0087,3.7811,4.177,6.0797,0.0002,0.0841,0.0112,0.0001,0.653,0.1524,2.5956,3.8904,3.0644,0.9779,3.8181,0.0013,0.0006,0.0011,0.0005,3.6591,0.9093,4.3499,0.189,1.5585,0.031,1.1585,0.6822,0.0809,0.6427,0.192,0.0216,0.0196,2.4309,2.7576,4.4803,1.2668,1.907,5.187,2.4694,0.8262,7.1256,3.9161,0.9923,0.2152,4.5902,0.0015,0.0018,0.0008,0.0009,5.7496,7.4468,0.1372,0.7591,4.4981,4.9141,1.3712,8.9716,6.8918,2.9404,4.8234,1.7786,0.9423,4.0778,2.9846,0.1209,6.4901,0.8981,1.2745,3.1473,1.8822,6.6601,3.4464,2.9724,0.0033,2.3887,2.9237,0.6158,0.3297,0.1741,1.8714,2.8392,2.198,3.0152,8.0493,2.9709,0.0027,0.0041,0.0006,0.0034,0.0162,2.861,1.7003,0.5444,1.3841,5.7231,4.2864,0.6358,0.462,2.4699,1.5891,1.8464,1.1895,2.3257,4.1236,5.5319,4.3127,4.0471,0.9779,0.2142,5.3184,3.5916,0.0025,0.0045,0.0008,0.0051,0.8047,3.5768,1.4277,6.3553,3.1018,0.1573,2.5497,0.0006,2.9932,3.7324,1.3223,7.7812,0.528,6.8578,3.1166,0.891,2.293,5.1579,0.0011,0.4728,5.1846,4.1846,10.7633,1.1846,3.3997,4.2165,0.5732,4.5514,4.0924,0.0039,0.0008,8.8519,0.2675,0.0674,0.1248,0.9587,2.1281,10.718,0.0112,0.0062,0.003,0.0046,2.6061,2.3371,5.5471,4.6693,3.2873,3.543,0.5413,5.1784,0.0283,1.5198,1.783,3.2891,8.6147,1.4559,3.1251,8.1929,4.9981,3.2959,1.6,1.2947,0.8557,0.2068,0.0513,1.9324,0.7232,2.6832,1.5706,1.0954,0.1631,2.6329,1.7743,5.1817,1.2044,3.0234,1.5514,1.0919,3.3743,2.7353,3.3861,2.1019,5.7751,3.7028,4.7227,1.607,0.321,0.705,2.48,0.98,0.889,0.0007,0.0001,0.7924,0.7738,0.3106,2.1397,3.9919,3.454,2.0189,4.8307,2.0841,2.9381,1.2233,5.3582,1.8794,0.5627,2.1885,5.2982,0.1361,1.6934,5.3852,1.631,0.7419,0.6742,1.1463,2.7071,2.9709,2.6203,0.3312,8.2984,0.0008,0.0002,1.1139,1.8166,3.5057,1.2802,2.377,0.0015,0.0025,0.0008,0.004,1.069,8.0804,0.1873,3.4266,5.9366,0.2944,1.7637,6.4757,0.2546,1.9872,3.8642,0.6478,2.8225,2.2809,5.0606,0.9368,2.3824,1.8171,1.9178,3.8309,0.772,1.9156,1.6233,0.1859,3.0367,0.0021,1.9733,4.0696,0.1474,4.0189,2.4021,2.3509,1.9921,1.1926,2.3613,4.242,0.1749,3.9562,6.1644,0.1612,1.6271,0.8397,0.6531,1.3365,2.5638,0.5446,3.484,3.9047,3.0081,3.4268,1.0939,0.0033,3.5708,1.9191,2.5141,0.7339,3.4281,0.3251,0.9241,4.0827,1.6115,4.2034,3.6048,2.2118,1.8934,3.3959,0.8996,0.8647,3.7261,2.7266,0.4836,0.3034,1.4191,0.7068]}

The pope is scheduled to set up a second residence in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, later Thursday. Francis told AFP during a brief stopover at Yangon airport, before returning to the Vatican, that the journey had been \u201ca pleasant surprise\u201d. \u201cThe atmosphere was simple, normal, I saw people who are very honest and happy to welcome and show support,\u201d the pope said. He did not name Myanmar by name but said at least 1,200 people were killed and 4,000 injured in the ongoing military crackdown on the Rohingya, who have fled to neighboring countries. Speaking to journalists after landing in Dhaka, he confirmed that the pope\u2019s second residence will be a guesthouse and a house built by Catholics from a diocese in Indonesia.\n\u201cThe government of Bangladesh requested the pope that he would come and stay a few days in their country. Then, there will be an agreement between the pope and the government to set up a base for his movements here. What has he decided to do on his base?\u201d asked the Catholic News Agency.\nIn Myanmar, the Catholic Church had urged the government to intervene in the crisis. The pope met in Yangon with several victims, relatives of relatives of victims. \u201cThis is a tragedy which should not continue, nor can. It is time now to open the eyes and the hearts of politicians and world leaders and think of those who have been persecuted and suffered\", said Francis.\nThis is a very delicate and painful situation which we are all concerned about,\u201d Francis had reportedly said, before returning to Rome to prepare for the weekend audience with the Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, where he reportedly suggested that there should be dialogue between governments and minorities.\nFrancis was scheduled to meet the Rohingya who were fleeing Myanmar, at an aid centre near Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, where he stayed for a few hours on Sunday, with children and elderly refugees standing shoulder to shoulder with children, men and women he had met during his visit to Myanmar. The pope also planned to visit the refugee settlement in Cox\u2019s Bazar during which he was to present a donation from the Vatican.\nWhile addressing senior leaders during his visit to Myanmar, Francis had also condemned the persecution of Buddhist protesters, warning of the \u201csigns of war\u201d in the country. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has a long history of bloody ethnic splits. The country, with a population of some 50 million, began drafting new constitutions after more than two decades of military rule in 2011.","token_len":602,"entropy":[8.7383,9.6676,0.8872,9.8052,1.5629,2.4334,3.4031,2.181,15.5874,0.0582,6.6574,2.028,0.4459,5.6806,2.3959,1.5671,0.6666,0.6922,4.5891,4.9964,4.4474,2.8267,0.0031,0.9465,3.9926,0.0126,0.6687,0.4224,3.4407,0.9063,1.397,2.2474,0.3678,2.7063,5.5701,3.4307,1.5853,3.6782,2.3124,0.3496,0.1561,23.9081,0.0079,4.0907,0.1187,0.139,7.2207,4.1284,1.3393,2.7482,2.237,0.0009,0.0001,0.1081,2.173,0.0146,0.7411,4.1451,1.037,0.0023,1.1362,0.3202,2.9929,1.2349,4.0244,4.3028,1.1856,0.2173,0.3968,1.1072,2.6476,5.9474,9.4744,7.2731,0.121,0.4507,1.0087,2.3927,1.864,3.2913,2.8789,0.0386,6.8084,0.8469,0.4594,6.1869,6.818,0.9075,2.8866,0.0009,1.5435,2.087,0.3867,0.6407,1.4056,0.7634,2.7175,2.3294,0.7887,6.5071,4.7825,6.7864,4.6983,1.7535,3.0197,2.4033,2.4632,1.8524,9.257,0.0172,1.6642,3.0809,6.2221,2.5102,0.14,1.6438,1.463,2.2979,0.4246,1.7456,5.2251,2.6815,0.6337,16.5588,6.6562,3.4647,5.4309,2.8021,2.5042,8.038,1.3904,7.6181,0.2798,2.2463,6.5683,1.4549,7.3333,1.3258,7.0733,1.0852,6.6019,5.7569,3.1409,3.412,2.2363,2.0753,6.0878,1.0035,5.0815,3.3557,5.0281,3.8724,5.4404,3.2715,2.5186,6.5686,4.2601,2.716,0.2815,0.3888,0.3536,2.7476,3.4333,0.15,3.4735,4.6578,4.244,0.0244,1.8842,1.6382,6.5499,2.1262,4.2964,0.1865,2.3952,1.251,1.8621,4.5678,2.0263,4.7389,0.4942,0.4582,2.0876,0.9744,0.9394,3.1181,3.5761,1.7031,0.9814,0.9951,0.6492,2.9482,1.4565,1.5257,2.615,1.368,2.9038,2.8486,0.8974,6.2475,1.2791,3.2023,1.8549,5.4782,0.4204,1.405,0.0007,0.1043,2.0652,5.5268,0.6938,0.9359,0.9462,10.8687,6.8241,2.1631,4.9139,2.658,3.0001,0.4557,3.18,4.3799,1.4592,2.5827,3.6473,5.8057,5.4527,1.7332,8.0088,3.1426,3.9615,5.4622,0.127,0.6719,5.7943,0.528,1.2622,4.7883,0.7925,1.4592,6.4802,1.5888,3.2938,6.4738,1.5374,1.7657,7.4484,1.023,3.8881,3.9384,2.7985,2.9784,5.8588,1.3695,0.4975,2.2761,4.3949,1.2161,1.7752,6.6208,1.1863,5.2358,1.867,0.0471,2.4736,4.9557,1.6578,0.3331,2.6929,0.0908,0.4814,1.0464,1.6413,3.8541,0.0188,0.4246,5.4836,1.4838,3.1808,8.1125,4.5146,0.7768,6.7116,4.2002,5.5775,3.6904,1.8712,0.2186,4.8719,2.0464,9.0238,0.7864,3.2434,3.0183,7.0535,1.2943,5.4057,3.4027,0.6563,0.9537,1.0291,3.9446,4.6019,0.1757,1.2836,4.5748,0.5323,4.8632,4.1804,0.6799,1.3366,0.3756,4.0281,1.3117,0.4269,3.3932,1.8324,1.864,3.529,4.1506,3.9853,3.6414,0.0008,1.7091,5.6619,7.0588,3.3989,8.1281,1.4058,6.1298,0.7886,0.8805,4.6519,4.7843,0.528,4.9083,1.0369,1.1751,5.4541,4.6011,3.1972,1.5999,4.7435,2.4365,5.8941,3.7825,8.3553,2.6169,0.708,2.8357,5.903,0.6576,5.3985,1.8837,3.0826,2.3201,3.1521,1.1128,0.1982,9.5448,1.0662,7.2565,0.0657,2.2035,6.9009,2.4967,5.0984,0.3499,1.5286,2.1017,5.7796,1.2918,5.2895,10.3276,1.1549,4.5746,0.7661,0.7134,4.9664,1.2208,1.4993,3.8589,5.5651,3.2364,4.7274,1.0044,3.6048,3.3209,2.3992,2.3951,4.8893,0.1649,1.4793,2.3056,1.4696,3.9109,6.0376,6.0074,1.1077,2.7696,3.2417,4.0763,0.0721,2.3711,2.3525,6.1504,0.358,1.4382,6.6497,8.1362,1.6439,1.6004,8.3284,2.4403,1.3453,0.0003,0.0006,2.2979,4.4162,0.356,6.3701,6.7089,0.8855,3.941,1.6241,0.0278,4.4437,0.982,4.8923,1.8334,5.1125,0.9676,0.8959,4.4876,0.0012,2.8248,3.302,0.0277,1.5506,1.7745,4.9521,5.7209,2.375,1.7702,1.3546,2.5643,4.8778,3.0589,5.2395,4.7089,3.2304,6.7999,16.6165,2.1994,3.6203,2.9721,0.0468,0.7769,4.8262,0.9168,2.2281,0.6793,6.11,0.9949,2.2416,1.4581,1.4862,2.7513,4.0495,2.1709,4.0741,6.9651,1.5304,2.9857,5.2922,8.2149,4.3651,0.3146,0.0041,1.259,5.3533,3.0325,6.9015,0.6055,0.0219,8.3784,1.2487,1.5047,3.2944,0.5829,1.2069,1.2331,1.0051,0.3211,1.9101,1.7172,2.8608,5.4996,0.2731,1.3507,1.3636,5.0658,8.137,1.8587,3.9116,0.8636,0.0197,0.0153,0.0642,0.0007,5.6267,5.53,0.7021,2.6133,2.0326,4.8019,1.1414,7.6522,3.7996,0.9529,5.2018,1.49,0.8099,4.8836,4.9864,8.8737,1.8611,5.2829,1.0508,0.883,0.6766,0.6855,0.2052,1.511,3.7491,1.9871,5.5387,0.641,3.7435,0.2965,4.7987,4.6471,2.1343,6.1534,2.3013,0.9984,11.2006,1.409,7.2495,1.8088,0.8573,3.3857,1.759,1.7373,2.0614,1.0797,1.0266,0.5035,8.4158,2.6008,6.5207,0.2131,0.0499,0.3732,0.1395,1.3187,2.6798,1.1146,0.503,0.0348,5.1948,3.4087,7.9847,1.9607,1.7808,2.5797,3.1156,3.2107,1.4856,0.3279,0.0972,4.4461,4.5168,0.0689,0.3236,6.1337,9.3209,4.0307,2.6113,0.0021,3.4717,6.2127,0.0026,2.2686,0.2069,0.0723,2.1571,0.0325,2.468,3.8626,0.4028]}

The meetings come as ratings agencies have sharply cut Brazil\u2019s credit rating amid growing concern about the government\u2019s ability to implement a plan to reform a pension system funded by workers\u2019 pay.\nThat comes as Brazil\u2019s economy shrank last year to its smallest annual decline in a decade as recessionary pressure from higher imports, weakening domestic demand and uncertainty around the financial reform stalled the recovery.\nThe government\u2019s debt ceiling has been raised in two places in recent weeks to avoid a default but is currently at a little more than 100 billion reais ($22.5 billion). Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Rousseff said Friday she believes a bond restructuring before the next scheduled one in January is unlikely.\nThe government is trying to reach an agreement with bondholders in a series of debt-buying events that would make it possible for it to avoid a downgrade to Aa3 \u2014 or in some cases even higher \u2014 by next month. Moody\u2019s has already cut Brazil\u2019s credit rating \u2014 down two notches from Baa3 \u2014 after the government defaulted on its US$10 billion bonds last week.\nBrazil\u2019s economy contracted 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter after suffering a 3.5 per cent contraction last year, the worst in a decade according to official data. The private sector said GDP was likely to shrink in the current quarter as government spending slows and business investment stays subdued. The country\u2019s inflation \u2014 which has been pushed by strong world markets for commodities \u2014 is expected to rise 3.8 per cent this year, also the highest since 2010.\nStill there is hope of a successful outcome of the meetings. Moody\u2019s cut Brazil\u2019s credit rating on Monday, but Fitch and S&P still did not downgrade the country\u2019s ratings. The government is scheduled to pay back US$9 billion next month and US$9.5 billion in March.\nEven though the rating agencies have cut Brazil\u2019s ratings on key indicators, they have yet to do so on its creditworthiness.\nBrazil\u2019s government debt has skyrocketed as a result of a wave of financial bailouts handed out at the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s. Since 2009 a bond default was avoided only once the government missed paying a debt service \u2014 after a year-long period of huge losses on the sale of foreign currency, or foreign currency borrowing. At the time, the default triggered another, although smaller, increase in the country\u2019s debt \u2014 making it nearly three times larger than in 2009.","token_len":603,"entropy":[8.3551,12.0654,1.1663,7.6199,0.3806,5.7327,0.8183,0.3931,0.0247,5.2833,4.918,1.9221,8.7057,7.2412,2.5469,0.1126,1.6028,1.8351,3.6066,2.1774,2.0703,5.5211,0.0025,0.0849,3.6347,1.2457,6.6962,4.4306,4.882,5.5509,0.531,7.9193,4.6718,4.3634,2.3789,5.9471,6.6155,2.3706,3.911,1.6229,3.1998,1.0334,0.189,19.6569,0.0133,0.0022,0.001,2.6876,3.174,0.0076,1.452,0.548,7.4329,0.2848,10.4529,0.1213,6.0791,1.3486,2.5039,0.1094,0.0007,18.2086,9.4008,8.2801,1.3191,0.7101,8.7133,0.0497,0.2741,2.9503,2.1278,5.5734,2.7301,1.2232,6.7299,0.1957,2.5453,5.4811,1.8597,9.0924,9.9733,0.3964,0.0085,3.735,0.1958,3.4063,2.8095,2.0927,1.5303,1.0822,2.5423,7.1026,0.118,0.0295,2.0394,0.0012,4.7979,2.6089,3.3593,0.2922,3.2043,4.0077,3.1672,0.3855,7.2732,0.4328,8.2645,6.8142,0.034,10.2937,2.2827,0.28,5.7645,4.2699,1.2697,2.3968,2.116,0.011,0.0004,2.5731,3.2839,0.2189,4.2005,0.3286,1.6208,2.8128,5.3324,2.79,3.8802,1.2391,3.4671,0.124,3.1729,6.3102,3.7754,4.4499,2.9971,5.7054,6.8896,3.3649,5.8788,3.033,0.274,0.528,4.8255,3.6404,1.2309,4.5996,6.1771,7.7656,1.8513,4.0521,0.3133,0.3008,2.1601,1.4993,2.6089,0.0353,0.001,4.1272,5.3047,2.2069,1.0649,0.8876,3.3451,4.347,3.7511,2.236,1.2752,0.7666,1.5064,4.0858,0.8895,1.7397,3.6375,3.461,4.2279,1.4744,2.8366,6.6539,1.1709,0.0039,4.4686,1.6179,4.5324,0.0096,1.439,5.0593,0.6164,2.1405,0.0515,1.0533,4.4791,0.7641,0.0061,0.0005,6.3426,0.3177,0.0009,0.0001,0.0007,2.9971,4.3345,1.8027,4.7755,2.5607,5.5,4.5676,6.5296,0.6869,3.7234,4.914,6.6113,3.3164,2.7352,2.1604,3.7902,1.1617,0.327,2.0475,1.5589,2.55,4.042,0.0348,4.6237,1.873,0.1629,0.788,2.8107,0.3115,2.9553,2.3167,2.6733,0.0015,4.7648,2.1672,5.2773,0.004,4.358,2.2157,2.466,4.3324,0.9714,1.965,0.8703,1.7222,0.016,4.9272,1.009,3.6186,4.1598,5.1432,2.893,2.6879,6.159,3.8054,6.1841,2.7093,0.1147,4.1755,2.2527,1.2488,2.1558,3.9243,1.7219,0.3705,7.4718,0.4133,0.0066,0.0746,2.5033,2.9482,2.2909,0.4286,0.0972,0.0023,0.0003,1.3396,0.0716,6.6645,3.788,5.8426,7.8548,0.0857,1.3151,4.3865,1.2758,1.1117,1.595,3.1944,2.2499,1.3,4.8125,0.015,0.6951,1.005,8.9714,0.2307,3.6016,0.5805,4.9627,2.4658,1.9004,0.2657,0.3489,2.4263,0.6738,0.0026,0.0014,3.423,4.382,3.3167,0.0569,1.9435,3.104,0.0015,0.4694,1.1909,2.4113,0.0156,3.2586,5.2162,1.0397,2.9669,0.193,1.8309,0.1523,0.0003,1.4219,3.134,0.7917,1.3714,2.2247,3.8673,2.5084,1.8455,0.4951,7.0229,0.0029,4.2108,0.5663,0.3853,1.9341,5.887,0.8139,4.3741,5.2719,2.3879,5.1173,0.0834,2.9579,2.7866,0.5981,4.605,1.0131,2.1581,4.1126,1.5568,4.5385,1.4926,5.0292,1.3394,8.2409,2.4216,0.2553,3.3445,2.9122,2.6832,0.0258,0.0025,4.4447,9.0415,1.8077,1.4857,1.5383,5.3462,3.0924,4.1232,8.231,3.8632,3.5461,9.8899,1.4565,1.6437,0.6414,0.0074,2.0627,3.7564,0.1472,2.4918,0.0412,0.0002,1.0258,0.079,1.5905,7.0215,2.6218,2.6578,0.8561,3.4704,0.3671,0.4222,5.3865,6.8197,0.968,3.6687,3.8549,0.9287,5.3435,6.1838,3.8357,0.6002,9.0024,1.1994,5.1338,0.1989,0.0019,0.0024,4.8663,0.1646,0.035,0.0019,0.0005,0.8125,0.0555,2.3241,2.4844,1.6321,2.9281,5.2425,0.0278,2.4058,3.8119,0.0265,0.0025,5.2957,5.3452,0.1497,1.8141,1.5153,0.5184,1.569,0.0062,0.0044,4.3702,0.8802,2.3471,1.8537,2.4675,3.7136,0.0219,5.8285,4.0979,6.3133,0.0065,3.8823,1.2264,7.0158,0.5452,2.8173,6.5124,0.0107,2.3914,1.1572,1.0933,0.012,0.8055,4.4016,1.0314,0.7927,5.3739,2.2348,1.1697,5.8868,1.1632,1.6,1.4793,0.1558,0.0251,0.0014,0.0005,2.5861,3.3526,5.7772,3.1988,0.8679,1.8081,1.6992,4.1674,0.0021,4.1239,0.4339,2.0414,3.9574,4.7711,2.2428,0.6767,1.4471,2.0469,0.3768,0.0014,0.001,2.3462,4.402,1.7931,6.4994,0.001,4.4304,1.7561,0.3243,0.0133,2.0063,5.2737,0.0249,4.6224,6.1132,0.0566,6.9143,0.3413,5.4987,0.6506,1.2561,0.0016,0.9782,3.3135,0.0117,2.0472,6.4427,0.8221,0.3407,1.0911,0.002,0.8416,4.2325,4.1953,5.2165,7.3882,4.2672,3.2316,5.4891,5.287,2.6698,3.4724,1.3142,6.7735,6.7981,3.7425,2.8606,3.4672,6.4588,4.0714,2.2217,4.0287,2.4145,0.1211,3.437,0.6784,7.6827,3.3937,2.9527,1.8623,6.8356,0.0531,6.0567,3.1736,3.8565,3.9259,4.063,2.8073,6.664,0.7302,5.3424,0.5027,1.4822,0.9535,1.2928,6.4437,5.9295,5.5631,6.4199,9.1954,2.0327,0.3514,5.8105,0.0779,1.106,2.0595,0.3983,0.0055,0.0062,1.4256,4.6444,6.0588,0.5403,4.1441,3.0616,0.0374,2.0201,0.4025,2.7748,2.5735,0.2121]}

High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.\n\" If we don't take measures now we will be faced with a crisis in a few years instead of a disaster. \"\nMeanwhile, the secretary-general of the World Organisation of the Migrant Workers said Sunday that the situation in Myanmar has become a \" grave human rights concern \" worldwide.\nThe International Organisation for Migration said it has been trying for months to get access to the Burmese refugee camps with no success.\n\" The people who have had the power to stop this war have not taken the right steps, and instead have pushed this crisis to escalation, \" the IOM said in a statement.\nIt called for the United Nations to use the Burmese government as a bargaining chip for a solution to the crisis, which has now left more than 200,000 refugees in Bangladesh.\nRefugees, who are mostly Muslim, flee the country armed forces following a crackdown by the Myanmar junta on the Rohingya community.\nThe IOM said the situation in the camps

However, its conservative, religiously based government has not yet moved to fully ban the cladding of the burqa, which covers the entire body or face, and the niqab, or veil, covering only the face.\nIslamic clerks in mosques are also required by law to teach people how to recite certain portions of the Quran, a task they could no longer do under Prime Minister Najib Razak's ruling Umno party.\nUmno has long been at war with a rising Sunni Muslim-leaning opposition movement known as Islamisation, and has pledged to do more to push back.\n\"It's clear that the more they Islamise, the harder they press,\" said Mr Ahmad Zahid Hashim, who heads an anti-abortion advocacy group in Malaysia.\n'Evasion & Evasion'\nMalaysia's Minister of Religious Affairs, Tengku Zafrul Hamid, a Muslim from the ruling party, has urged clerics to use the \"very low number\" of veil or burqa-clad women praying in mosques as a reason to be \"very cautious\".\nBut he added: \"I still don't know where all the reports come from.\"\nHe was responding to news reports this week that a study by the Ministry of Religious Affairs showed that less than one per cent of women actually wore a burqa or a niqab in 2015.\nIn his post published in a blog on Monday (Nov 30), Mr Tengku Zafrul said he would continue to discuss the matter with the Islamic Religious Council of Malaysia.\n\"I think it's very important we know which Muslim women actually wear the burqa or the niqab in the mosques,\" he wrote.\n\"We will look into this. I think if we can find the answers to this, we will know how to handle the situation.\"\nThe report that sparked the backlash was titled \"Attitudes of the Women's Section towards Muslim Women in Muslim Societies\". It did not mention Islam as a reason for wearing the burqa, the study said.\nMalaysia has for decades been divided between two political camps - the National Front and the Islamic State of Malaysia, or Amanah.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Amanah's chairman, Muhammad Mahathir, led a campaign that urged Muslims to give up the traditional Malay language and start learning English because it was useful for jobs.\nIt failed to gain traction but has resurfaced under the present government after its leaders were accused of using Islam in opposition to Anwar Ibrahim, the former premier and his movement.","token_len":603,"entropy":[7.9574,0.281,10.0321,10.487,9.2807,1.0706,3.6754,0.044,4.6565,3.2586,4.0501,10.0077,1.0126,9.6356,0.8668,2.0099,7.0211,0.2925,0.2341,6.2661,4.821,1.2878,2.7695,5.9939,1.0258,4.3019,0.4635,2.3728,5.7593,0.8167,0.9695,4.7135,7.3045,0.0898,4.3719,3.7812,3.7473,2.0615,5.8416,1.0502,0.9084,8.131,0.023,0.9757,2.1163,0.2444,0.3224,21.3566,7.3603,8.3174,4.051,2.9947,3.7069,0.3152,2.397,9.1348,3.7923,2.4125,0.0028,0.0231,1.6479,4.2322,1.7208,2.893,2.4649,9.5781,6.607,1.776,2.914,0.0197,2.405,0.6676,1.7909,0.0076,1.1383,1.43,4.1372,0.1235,5.4528,6.2488,2.6901,5.3372,4.0043,2.3313,1.2321,4.0945,3.1284,5.9265,0.9287,5.1287,4.58,1.5868,10.767,5.5691,2.1277,2.4213,5.9004,0.43,1.5194,1.9281,3.6976,0.8748,3.4113,1.1751,5.6317,1.3659,1.456,1.9679,2.8582,5.2938,0.0006,0.0022,1.0323,4.0784,1.526,0.8761,3.2557,1.6995,0.2681,1.2757,0.6377,0.3975,5.9348,12.5657,1.9388,5.4762,2.4586,2.278,3.5287,3.1176,0.4635,0.0366,7.8952,4.5789,1.5071,0.0386,3.8639,4.2784,6.8793,0.0229,0.7495,0.8282,1.4204,3.2386,6.0773,3.7663,5.5834,3.7626,0.0073,0.583,2.377,6.3154,0.0025,0.1633,0.0023,0.0635,0.0002,0.6239,5.1522,7.6009,0.4233,1.5615,0.4565,0.3309,8.5939,0.0184,1.5569,3.8382,1.595,5.7014,3.4125,0.0579,5.207,5.3005,3.4019,1.1209,3.4479,6.9459,3.7072,2.6417,2.9111,0.0199,3.4705,2.0739,1.2343,3.2297,1.5233,5.784,0.1978,5.5882,1.7941,0.1541,5.0233,1.2426,3.4566,0.544,2.7388,2.9248,1.3222,3.8511,0.4071,1.4056,6.4602,4.2022,10.1511,0.5071,0.8752,0.0467,3.5167,1.705,9.7476,4.003,0.8081,4.2447,4.639,4.8581,0.5192,8.3966,0.6029,0.2909,3.0816,0.9004,3.2049,2.0764,0.0033,9.5191,3.99,0.071,2.0378,2.0305,0.4429,0.5528,6.1336,8.0032,3.357,6.3191,5.0091,0.2613,0.2302,0.1444,4.1021,0.0072,0.3021,0.7908,6.5483,0.4866,1.7838,0.0423,1.3501,4.755,3.0979,4.1127,5.3518,4.795,5.2789,2.2155,5.9774,1.0332,0.6482,5.8241,3.3905,3.5034,1.239,3.3302,3.4859,0.414,1.5059,4.2819,6.5383,0.4557,4.2524,1.4549,3.208,6.0028,5.8358,4.1924,0.7124,0.2825,7.5233,5.7266,3.6441,0.0748,2.1144,1.6746,1.7226,8.5814,1.2338,2.0235,2.3388,0.8564,4.852,0.5833,4.9272,3.6403,3.385,1.7073,1.7441,0.1566,2.8106,2.2865,3.7213,1.4818,0.0128,2.6407,6.0256,1.8645,0.0007,1.9354,3.5166,4.0552,0.9668,7.9395,3.481,0.0062,1.729,0.1188,3.9759,3.7427,2.2306,0.0293,6.373,1.0447,4.7732,0.2325,0.2978,2.1991,5.5863,1.0701,0.7077,5.337,0.0315,1.3339,0.0258,2.6324,0.6163,5.1136,0.0129,2.4605,1.3991,0.0045,0.0127,3.6062,6.21,3.5702,1.9116,2.8611,0.0312,2.1137,2.6028,2.8034,0.0005,0.0031,1.642,4.008,0.7746,0.3511,3.0305,3.5214,6.4264,8.7463,1.6735,3.5116,3.6695,1.7752,2.2397,5.6657,3.4589,3.8931,0.1251,0.7726,7.8019,0.0034,0.0007,3.924,0.0031,0.004,0.0018,2.7058,2.2652,2.6091,3.2921,0.3886,5.6899,0.8623,2.2639,0.5863,1.0441,5.5956,4.9921,2.1649,0.7668,0.0152,2.2442,0.3087,1.3812,1.5021,3.2827,1.6559,0.5529,2.8852,0.2658,4.2624,4.8812,4.3381,4.2177,2.4463,4.3995,0.8754,0.7912,1.9996,0.1135,1.5798,1.8914,0.3065,0.0005,0.0049,2.6158,1.973,2.2832,1.1771,0.1723,1.9934,0.1787,0.4851,1.4281,2.2065,2.8539,4.3796,0.6074,1.5201,3.2502,2.1635,2.4207,3.9329,1.2428,2.3147,1.9948,2.8572,3.8809,1.3586,1.1997,1.4223,1.0104,0.7941,5.2001,2.747,0.6678,5.5504,2.2162,1.1047,1.0847,0.2059,2.4837,3.5158,5.768,4.5329,0.6281,4.6958,1.2163,5.7724,0.7208,7.2008,1.7452,2.985,1.6213,4.1408,3.0973,5.6293,7.2924,2.5312,0.496,1.11,3.7601,4.1167,0.0238,1.1873,2.1338,5.4502,0.1116,2.0977,4.2296,3.8226,0.7339,4.6848,0.4351,3.2179,0.4247,1.5477,0.022,1.6399,4.9491,2.2685,0.7033,0.4269,0.1685,5.172,0.015,0.0731,2.2314,5.7195,1.7098,1.0299,5.2953,1.5264,2.1968,4.1316,0.817,2.3117,1.2192,4.7942,4.5638,1.2529,0.3522,4.2885,1.7459,2.1114,8.5179,1.8549,1.6688,16.2361,4.0253,1.0926,0.6794,2.8778,1.6566,6.886,0.0136,1.611,0.5839,0.0001,0.1356,4.1473,0.0037,3.1362,8.8287,0.656,3.1204,5.8848,2.2982,0.0039,1.6448,3.4432,1.1126,2.7541,3.0019,4.3119,2.1955,0.3527,5.2234,0.3345,2.3912,2.4259,7.8972,0.0892,5.2928,0.8568,6.3946,4.1555,2.0771,7.1606,1.4886,0.5892,9.3553,0.8314,5.745,1.0602,0.5198,4.2714,5.6759,0.9019,1.5355,1.9548,5.2117,2.6273,4.9745,0.0014,4.3222,1.2544,7.1415,0.8832,4.159,3.6138,4.4481,2.2673,2.8239,0.1249,3.3075,3.6348,3.2704,5.4804,0.615,10.8506,2.1557,1.6108,1.8943,1.1039,2.3522,4.4449,2.0892,4.3554,7.9223,2.6616]}

The US Navy will supply the same missiles to its own ships, which are based in Gibraltar and Greece.\nThis is not exactly new news for China. The UK\u2019s defence industry and government are in fact \u201cstepping up\u201d military ties with China as defence deals are seen as a way to mitigate the rising debt crisis in the UK.\nHowever, the UK\u2019s plans have drawn criticism from officials in Washington. It says the missiles will provide the UK with a new capability that will allow it more freedom of action.\nThe proposed military relationship is part of Britain\u2019s longstanding interest in joining the emerging Chinese military power and an increasing Chinese appetite for technology. Britain is on board the US\u2019s missile buildup in Europe.\nChina has in fact expanded its military involvement in the Eastern Mediterranean region over the past few years. This includes the deployment of naval vessels, and anti-missile batteries near Cyprus.\nHowever, Britain\u2019s military and defence ties to China have been less direct than its relationship with the US, and the UK has largely shied away from criticising China militarily. The UK\u2019s Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has indicated that Britain will be supporting the US in the Eastern Mediterranean as well, but has not called out the Chinese presence.\nThe plan is seen by many as a way for the UK to secure the resources it needs to service its debt, which has risen due to its spending on national healthcare, defence, and a rising social security system.","token_len":603,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2192,5.4102,6.5488,4.2907,1.6343,2.3249,4.8774,3.446,4.8806,6.1593,7.0767,5.4407,6.489,0.155,0.4905,0.0017,15.1637,6.6921,9.5461,5.0788,0.4928,2.0578,2.4684,2.3858,3.0695,0.542,2.7706,0.4625,1.6993,4.0575,4.4058,0.0169,0.0005,8.3681,6.2899,6.8264,8.6591,5.7454,1.1045,11.2153,2.1402,10.8369,2.6492,2.2581,5.9142,5.5287,5.5475,1.5477,1.1099,7.8392,2.0838,5.3775,1.3312,5.9922,6.8324,6.8784,3.8059,1.0668,8.9951,7.8368,6.2359,0.1174,1.6676,5.3727,1.5272,3.6642,5.3728,1.4479,0.5949,3.7041,5.9448,3.2375,3.1312,1.4889,0.0334,2.1513,0.788,2.0843,9.7199,2.1529,0.0782,3.5283,0.4483,1.1867,5.1546,2.6504,5.4285,10.018,0.6936,6.5771,1.1011,6.4469,0.9328,10.5042,0.2792,9.7795,0.0055,2.0943,7.8483,3.3001,14.1723,3.3385,7.0114,2.773,8.4449,3.2311,2.5888,5.1915,0.6948,2.326,4.6642,0.805,4.4585,2.3381,7.1732,1.9784,5.2493,9.3642,6.5818,0.9229,11.332,3.4571,2.9886,0.2016,4.2929,1.5339,3.5074,0.1809,2.9111,1.912,1.2486,0.3357,3.8197,1.3143,1.6845,4.0493,0.0002,0.7616,0.5191,6.217,2.3285,3.3294,0.3356,0.8903,0.6785,1.3435,1.9038,2.08,2.8898,2.7357,4.9076,2.5994,0.6715,5.8146,1.6875,3.2385,3.0119,5.0936,5.9015,0.2988,4.5229,1.0142,4.9934,1.0377,5.977,0.7021,2.0662,2.3696,2.84,5.253,2.2843,3.2154,1.0984,2.6089,5.6202,1.6625,0.0331,0.8305,0.564,4.6314,2.609,2.9633,0.7709,1.8395,2.861,0.96,3.303,0.0241,4.2685,3.1421,6.2799,2.6821,1.7745,0.6559,6.3618,0.8928,5.214,7.1023,3.1842,1.9737,3.5711,0.083,2.0126,1.0465,3.287,0.2154,1.0866,0.114,0.9429,0.9432,6.8986,7.9822,3.7454,1.8621,3.1879,5.6929,1.33,6.2335,0.0971,4.9288,1.4092,5.8844,7.1802,5.8411,2.2226,6.9848,7.9276,2.462,6.5558,0.0209,2.7834,0.1675,9.2436,3.643,5.8164,4.9033,1.8711,2.9464,2.2759,1.2154,1.16,3.6983,5.5115,5.5334,1.6043,0.5276,1.3897,4.7285,0.0538,0.1023,6.7741,0.284,9.0303,2.6439,6.8675,0.0306,0.0003,6.3804,0.4565,8.9765,2.0219,4.1169,3.4608,4.367,0.2689,0.2194,4.472,4.184,0.217,0.0267,3.3713,3.1639,6.0136,2.6356,3.1486,3.9331,3.7304,4.4447,1.8692,3.4652,5.1328,1.9119,5.5168,10.9427,2.9926,0.6924,7.8421,4.0953,1.4993,1.9647,3.924,2.5615,4.5194,4.626,1.1098,5.7903,2.2247,1.2357,3.1595,3.2536,1.7611,2.0343,2.8721,1.5686,3.821,0.6596,7.084,1.873,7.1776,0.4733,0.7432,3.9426,2.147,1.9639,6.443,3.2127,1.7384,1.7249,4.6124,1.1435,2.0029,4.6654,12.054,1.2166,0.151,4.0499,3.0568,4.3663,3.282,2.2904,4.0614,5.0659,10.6586,0.7085,6.1821,0.2786,0.2565,8.6692,2.6806,5.3059,6.3773,0.5478,1.7408,3.6447,8.527,5.3773,1.6619,5.7437,0.381,1.3191,1.4611,0.3471,7.0044,1.4177,4.501,6.4432,2.7266,1.576,0.5025,4.1168,0.6677,0.7997,3.2766,0.1336,1.3408,1.5415,2.5782,0.1126,0.0156,4.9298,2.9776,4.3956,0.9948,0.374,6.4621,0.9407,1.9973,2.1735,4.772,6.1233,1.5071,4.855,1.7437,4.5475,2.9223,1.8944,0.5699,1.4479,3.6679,3.1295,2.4881,1.8586,2.7039,1.0374,5.6901,2.6972,1.3965,2.9578,2.5884,0.7115,1.7874,4.1414,3.6819,6.1364,2.9521,3.1414,0.0122,4.494,2.084,0.2775,0.0268,6.1723,6.0733,0.1111,5.3951,0.5528,7.4459,4.3552,1.4086,4.3157,2.9927,6.0743,3.1418,4.993,4.93,0.2086,5.9572,1.9738,4.576,1.9547,5.3655,2.9386,3.9138,4.1444,4.1213,0.5055,0.0251,5.0542,6.5169,1.9751,3.3303,1.7154,0.676,3.8429,1.6336,6.2385,2.7651,5.0874,0.2726,0.9845,3.7014,0.2956,0.9517,5.4229,0.6747,1.1351,3.7791,0.0781,0.395,1.538,0.1724,0.8966,3.5362,2.0618,2.2538,1.4124,0.012,4.5372,0.9257,2.6694,4.3146,7.2425,0.0016,4.1493,0.0037,3.8265,5.6263,4.2812,1.0709,0.8219,3.8723,0.0729,3.1326,1.0023,0.0129,0.0023,1.6925,4.2594,2.2968,4.8007,3.9788,0.2791,1.4921,1.3456,5.1121,4.7964,1.3394,5.3799,2.988,0.3343,0.5675,0.7834,1.7475,1.6748,1.8255,1.8998,1.8113,5.0095,7.5775,0.073,0.0108,0.0052,7.9305,0.0211,1.2502,6.9905,0.0045,0.4075,2.8094,1.3539,1.5611,0.0171,0.0039,6.4863,1.5041,0.8292,8.3261,1.3637,0.0011,0.2079,1.5521,4.8184,0.4624,1.6595,1.9355,3.0359,3.184,1.3625,1.9444,1.1353,1.7671,4.2705,0.0811,3.5422,2.2817,2.2523,1.5047,1.6515,1.5551,5.3128,3.5827,1.4598,1.5218,4.5176,1.9278,0.2658,1.8314,5.1468,2.1759,4.1162,1.2901,0.977,0.2886,0.8698,2.6378,1.6453,1.1162,1.1985,0.3366,4.8977,2.5819,5.7054,1.1754,0.1842,0.3853,8.4476,0.4487,8.4506,3.0067,2.3492,1.9683,2.312,5.4703,0.0567,3.8939,7.6151,1.0466,6.2451,8.0876,1.2536,2.7699,1.0622,0.7957,5.3363,4.1,5.469,1.428,2.3824,0.2282]}

{"prompt":"Corsican nationalists won almost half of the vote in the first round of the French Mediterranean island s territorial election on Sunday , a landslide likely to fuel local calls for greater autonomy from Paris","text":"Corsican nationalists won almost half of the vote in the first round of the French Mediterranean island s territorial election on Sunday, a landslide likely to fuel local calls for greater autonomy from Paris.\nCorsica has long claimed it has distinct identity and cultural links both to France and Italy and wants to have more say in decisions that could impact Corsicans, like decisions that would be made over the construction of a nuclear power plant, French military facilities, and other public services.\nIn the French capital Rome, local authorities expressed support for Corsican independence and urged the French to respect the will of the Corsicans, who are known for their independence-seeking movements in the past.\n\"The French government must come to terms with the will of the Corsican people. We are waiting,\" Rome Mayor Gian Maria Banfi told Italian public radio Radio 24.\n\"The right of self-determination is a legitimate right and must be respected. What has happened in Corsica will lead us to a strong movement of independence.\"\nCorsica is a French territory that, though a small island in the Mediterranean, has long been a target of independence movements and in 1999 there was a violent independence movement in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio that led to three deaths.\nSome of the island's inhabitants have since spoken of feeling a special affinity with the U.S., and have made efforts to attract foreign governments and companies to the island.\nOn Tuesday, some U.S. politicians came to Corsica to say good luck in the election. They included former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Richard L. Berman, Congressman Pete Domenici, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former State Senator Robert Francis Kennedy, among others.\nIn a statement on Monday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the French would consult the island's elected authorities and its people about their plans to become a French \"outlier republic\" - an independent state ruled by an island population but tied to the rest of France through a series of constitutional reforms.\n\"The French government will seek to ensure all aspects of our relations are compatible with their legitimate aspirations,\" Juppe said.\nOn Sunday, Corsican National Liberation Party (PNL, right-wing) leader Jean-Guy Talamoni, who is running for a second three-year term on the island's regional council, told Sky News that Corsican independence would be \"inevitable\" in a future for the tiny island of 8,500 residents that is sandwiched between Sardinia on the Italian side and France.\nBut the PNL, which has no links to the long-living Corsican independence movement, did not win a majority in the Corsican regional council elections and has no majority in Parliament or at the regional level of Parliament.\nFor his part, Talamoni has pledged to follow France\"s lead once Corsican independence was secured.","token_len":605,"entropy":[7.8938,4.8411,10.428,6.9939,6.0063,3.1195,0.4438,0.5084,0.9767,1.2198,1.0132,3.1919,0.4441,1.0163,0.9441,4.017,14.3761,4.6983,10.9559,11.6145,1.6137,2.3003,1.6887,0.9146,3.1739,5.6133,8.1798,0.0375,4.9743,7.5074,5.6817,0.1654,3.9882,2.405,2.9851,4.9086,0.489,0.2568,16.0582,0.8568,3.545,2.8851,2.6985,5.0721,2.9146,2.1986,9.6629,3.8581,2.0754,4.5122,2.9387,7.463,3.0229,2.0771,0.1189,2.8072,2.8585,4.6334,0.4645,4.5506,4.5809,3.6403,0.6499,6.1891,3.287,3.9605,3.1652,8.9219,4.9392,3.5745,5.7215,6.351,2.5779,1.5518,2.6252,1.8808,3.8905,1.3995,7.1362,0.0779,1.1128,6.5091,0.8234,0.7794,2.6946,5.9887,5.5523,5.5571,1.9842,1.8319,3.1333,4.0043,2.6808,0.3595,0.2825,3.3541,1.5795,4.4255,4.1843,8.219,0.5947,4.6564,4.219,4.6551,3.6733,0.1387,1.8087,0.9882,1.4354,2.0138,3.9129,1.3965,2.8508,1.5472,3.4025,1.1627,5.0605,0.0185,0.8542,4.8228,1.5305,1.8592,1.5909,2.1137,4.4135,0.9927,0.4936,3.5569,6.1862,2.5961,5.5059,2.878,0.9537,4.9864,0.3996,0.3164,1.6665,2.0182,2.2987,2.6851,3.2023,5.6907,0.4769,1.4315,0.0412,0.6277,6.0833,0.0589,0.4099,0.6489,0.9173,0.1255,2.5355,1.7617,2.0123,5.4356,4.307,5.1444,1.3908,4.2694,8.5168,8.3975,7.0574,1.1569,4.5471,6.1956,1.1356,7.8893,7.6884,0.7064,0.6065,2.7476,2.0083,5.5564,1.2143,3.0447,0.0807,0.0469,1.577,2.0391,5.1254,1.3253,1.8931,4.4937,0.2802,0.4163,1.6993,5.1692,3.7977,0.5299,0.9505,2.2745,0.1137,3.852,4.0486,3.1972,0.3484,2.5186,6.2533,6.9867,1.988,4.3994,2.8896,0.1141,1.6304,0.0863,0.168,1.8556,1.9852,3.9033,3.243,2.009,4.5518,4.7975,3.9957,2.9099,1.2238,1.6804,0.3153,1.2191,0.807,1.4381,2.4791,0.6461,1.3246,4.8337,0.3763,7.3215,2.1208,2.6834,5.1146,5.7526,6.1728,0.8378,0.5432,5.1808,5.3375,1.1779,1.257,1.3062,5.0197,0.3912,2.2437,1.2921,8.9486,0.2196,0.0344,3.0012,2.3607,0.049,5.7843,1.0481,0.8561,0.4534,5.2086,2.6146,0.287,4.0463,0.0535,3.1058,1.6609,4.2082,5.5423,2.3946,4.4324,3.5527,4.4574,3.7427,0.8756,0.898,7.0839,0.0955,0.0442,1.2746,2.6861,3.1648,4.4693,4.0589,0.0783,7.1716,2.0469,6.2072,2.1828,3.6784,0.5698,1.6047,0.4454,0.6079,0.3965,4.2567,2.9746,0.2978,5.2882,4.9064,0.0007,0.0047,0.0624,3.6735,5.748,1.3662,1.0801,0.2118,0.9759,4.7595,7.4555,4.8151,2.6115,1.8156,2.809,1.2945,4.8093,3.7226,2.8154,2.1862,0.8998,0.0056,0.7175,3.7538,0.0007,0.0172,0.0286,2.1453,0.3225,5.5222,4.6099,5.3417,0.9675,7.9042,0.2413,6.079,5.446,4.0272,0.0544,0.1555,0.6253,2.5495,0.0006,0.0188,0.0031,2.8164,0.0026,4.2589,0.6974,0.0222,0.0002,0.0001,0.3338,3.1966,4.3094,0.2862,1.4624,1.7232,0.4697,1.9552,1.723,5.2887,3.2028,4.0048,11.18,4.9867,2.1013,2.2316,0.15,0.0529,0.2029,2.8766,1.6199,0.9495,2.5566,2.2064,0.2016,3.3221,1.606,0.0537,6.4999,0.005,0.0703,0.0009,0.4926,0.9041,1.58,2.2684,2.7514,5.8777,2.4202,5.2618,0.5032,4.41,3.1612,1.7542,5.116,3.3353,2.9633,2.5796,3.4273,1.377,4.0665,1.5457,2.565,3.7198,10.6861,2.8815,7.2303,1.4481,5.8333,2.6091,5.1774,1.6522,3.9832,0.1745,2.7809,3.686,4.2886,5.5119,8.6539,0.2054,1.1705,4.5554,0.0048,2.443,5.0519,1.4602,4.0856,0.0005,4.2652,2.481,0.8492,0.2312,1.1742,1.6536,1.2418,1.0966,1.7828,4.1083,0.4036,2.7739,4.6663,3.9316,0.0416,2.6392,4.2633,2.9175,5.7147,0.9542,2.5708,6.3972,3.1633,1.4345,0.2971,0.0004,0.0007,0.1496,0.4102,0.5835,4.3073,1.6453,0.3235,2.946,1.5451,4.5465,3.6734,1.1109,0.849,5.7659,0.2353,6.7155,7.9688,3.1105,0.1028,1.8667,1.2039,3.8464,0.4052,6.3459,7.9744,4.3798,6.9204,2.8993,1.0565,1.8501,3.4656,0.5078,2.8139,1.2219,5.9278,0.031,0.2794,0.0265,3.3856,1.3698,1.0895,1.4845,6.5559,0.6698,0.1115,2.6346,7.0129,0.1043,1.0683,2.9669,1.4375,1.6019,1.4583,0.9686,1.8684,6.6619,0.1344,0.0233,0.7532,2.2206,1.8799,2.9877,7.0155,0.6766,7.0022,0.591,3.2362,4.1106,0.9897,1.8854,3.6962,3.7375,2.3746,5.4837,0.0002,0.0941,6.2102,0.007,5.6263,0.1374,2.0638,2.3278,0.9698,4.8321,2.1518,0.2019,4.2908,2.4981,2.0895,0.076,3.0171,0.7493,1.4737,4.5594,6.6819,0.4894,0.6978,8.8741,0.2189,9.7101,1.1506,0.1406,5.8022,0.0438,0.2013,4.0796,0.2611,6.9242,1.4641,0.5423,0.8905,0.4682,8.3987,0.0521,4.1115,0.5126,2.5454,3.8092,2.2584,3.4419,5.1276,0.3796,4.103,3.9452,4.7237,0.4854,3.1637,0.93,4.4178,4.3717,0.4763,0.4449,5.5257,3.3616,0.0022,0.0675,1.9764,0.0032,0.0009,2.3557,4.4146,0.2632,5.8239,4.2428,10.6751,0.2489,0.7674,7.527,3.9578,0.559,0.7057,3.9074,3.0388,1.1992]}
{"prompt":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred on Monday from running in next year s presidential election after officials ruled he was ineligible to take part due to a suspended prison sentence he says was","text":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred on Monday from running in next year s presidential election after officials ruled he was ineligible to take part due to a suspended prison sentence he says was unrelated to political activity.\nThe ruling came after the head of Russia s anti-corruption agency said it was not his right to disqualify Navalny, who is serving three years in a Russian prison sentence for breaching that s sentence earlier this year.\nNavalny was barred on Monday from standing as either a prime candidate or a special representative at the elections due to be held in Russia in March 2021, the Rospotrebnadzor (ROS) said.\n\u201cThe relevant Rosstat ruling of 16 January 2021 is inapplicable to Alexey Navalny, since, under Article 21 of the Elections of the President of the Russian Federation Act in force since July 16, 2011, the President of Russia can decide how to use the means of a candidate\u2019s disqualification,\u201d Rospotrebnadzor said in a statement. \u201cROS has the right to decide its own disqualification criteria.\u201d\nNavalny, 44, was jailed last April, less than a week after he was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent.\nHe has sought to undermine Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power for more than two decades. Putin often uses his parliamentary immunity for avoiding jail when he is under investigation. Since Navalny was jailed, he has become a frequent target of the Russian authorities.\nIn his latest effort, Moscow ordered him to stay away from the ballot until he is fully cured of an illness, the Russian side said.\nThe ruling also barred Alexei Navalny from voting at municipal elections that are due to be held later this year, the Rospotrebnadzor said.\nUnder Russia s law, an activist can be deprived of the right to vote if he is serving a prison sentence.\nRussian lawmaker Irina Yarovaya said Putin has effectively put Navalny on trial by not allowing him to stand in the presidential election.\n\u201cIt seems he knows in advance that he will not get any votes, that he cannot win any seats in the Duma and will be excluded as a candidate to be a candidate for the presidential election,\u201d Yarovaya, a deputy member of the Duma, told The Associated Press.\nA Rospotrebnadzor statement also ruled that Navalny s alleged attempt to sabotage a project of a Russian state-owned airline for installing an artificial intelligence system is also a violation of the law.\n\u201cThe use of a special program created specifically to interfere with the internal work of the air-\nline

{"prompt":"A Papua New Guinea court has given hundreds of asylum-seekers who were held for years in a controversial Australian detention center the right to sue the PNG government for compensation , Australian media reported on","text":"A Papua New Guinea court has given hundreds of asylum-seekers who were held for years in a controversial Australian detention center the right to sue the PNG government for compensation, Australian media reported on Saturday.\nMore than 500 people are appealing the decision and about 150 have been freed, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.\nThey say they were detained and confined in the facility for more than 20 years, many of them from the Muslim majority PNG but also from countries including Ethiopia, Laos and the Philippines.\nIn a preliminary hearing in February, a court jury found it was illegal to hold people indefinitely while they waited for refugee processing and granted them leave to sue, the ABC noted.\nIn a statement, the PNG Immigration Department said the decision is not final, making it possible to appeal.\n\"We are concerned that the Australian Federal government has ignored all decisions of our courts, but if the cases proceed, they will be presented on merit,\" the department said.\nSome prisoners were kept in the facility for decades, while others were held for only months, including refugees from the Muslim majority Papua New Guinea who had traveled from rural areas to the cities to find asylum, the ABC reported.\n\"There is a lot of concern... people are still in indefinite detention and their cases are pending, their application is pending. They're still being held in custody,\" said an assistant general counsel for the Australian Council for Refugee Resettlement.\nA spokesman for the Australian government welcomed the decision but said it was unlikely any detainees would get compensation.\n\"You don't see a lot of courts taking a position in such cases against an ongoing government policy,\" said the officer.\nAttorney Sam McIntosh, one of the key lawyers defending the detainees, said the verdicts could lead to further appeals against the PNG government's detention policy.\n\"Not just asylum seekers, I suspect people could follow their lead and claim compensation from various government departments. It has to be, for my money, a good precedent for that in the future,\" he said.\nSince 1997, the PNG government has received an average of 500 to 600 asylum-seekers each year and in some years the number of arrivals soared to 1,500.\nAustralia has agreed to let refugees stay in some Papua New Guinea islands for up to a year after they are rescued and processed by PNG, allowing them time to plan their relocation from islands to mainland PNG.\nAustralia is in talks with Papua New Guinea on establishing a permanent settlement at the island of Manus.\nAn investigation by Human Rights Watch found some of the people released had been held at a secret location for long periods and were denied access to legal counselling.\nSeveral detainees said they had experienced torture during their detention, including a person who was beaten with an electric baton more than 20 times and whose eyes were burnt.\nAustralia had been reluctant to accept this policy for years and it is often criticised internationally for what some in the conservative Australian media label as \"humiliation\" of the

Senate office. Schumer said he would have wanted to vote in favor of the measure, but a deal with House Speaker John Boehner \u2014 the Republican leader in the chamber \u2014 gave the Senate floor to Republicans and Democrats that is typically reserved for a reconciliation vote.\nRepublicans\u2019 approach may have benefited from the timing of the vote. The Senate is in recess until Monday, but most of the major issues that could come up the start of a yearlong legislative session seem to have already been resolved.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hasn\u2019t said when he will introduce any legislation, but the top priority is keeping any bill from moving beyond an initial markup.\nSenate Republicans say the plan will take time to get to a floor vote because they don\u2019t have access to the Republican-controlled House. House passage of a tax overhaul is all they need, although they say they want President Barack Obama\u2019s signature on it.\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate can still come to a deal in the weeks ahead, even with the full strength of the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s calendar this fall,\u201d Rep. Ed Markey, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Thursday, adding that he expects \u201cthey will. \u201c\nMarkey, the author of an alternative tax proposal that would create a one-time boost for top earners, said most Senate Republicans in supportive of a tax cut. \u201cBut we are talking here about cutting taxes \u2026 this would benefit the American middle class,\u201d he said.\nThere are few remaining legal hurdles remaining for a tax overhaul. Congress has already approved a temporary moratorium on spending in the face of a looming deficit but hasn\u2019t passed a measure that funds those government needs. Some legal experts say it\u2019s unlikely the government would be open to a substantial increase in spending or deficits while also pursuing a major tax cut.\nThe tax overhaul includes a provision that would put a new tax on most retirement accounts, but it would not create additional taxes on individuals. The change has already been put off at least two times.\nSome Democrats and other opponents of the overhaul, particularly the American Taxpayer Relief Act advocates, are upset by the idea of increased taxes on some retirees, saying the change won\u2019t address the deficit.\nBut tax reform advocates are already calling for a permanent moratorium on additional tax increases while the tax overhaul is debated and agreed to.\nCongress is expected soon to unveil a major tax overhaul, but the timeline for its passage is unclear.","token_len":607,"entropy":[6.7193,0.0882,0.0354,0.0301,1.3201,8.0163,2.5035,9.7851,0.3283,2.8278,3.2568,9.4134,0.0517,1.8811,5.7719,0.5233,3.6112,4.0339,0.6421,6.0649,1.2387,3.9963,1.9204,5.7117,0.5285,5.5715,0.7612,7.7935,4.4967,0.1094,0.0006,17.8469,6.8567,12.7088,14.1159,6.2491,3.5656,5.14,1.5611,1.1251,8.5527,1.7917,5.4902,2.3749,4.8593,5.9954,6.3459,2.0547,0.988,0.2521,15.4113,2.9202,2.5574,1.5498,1.6773,0.467,0.3466,4.2066,2.5341,1.7929,1.5733,4.8017,0.7328,3.3008,0.331,0.5708,4.8185,1.8785,1.7745,0.3493,8.7221,4.1785,1.0036,8.2502,6.5879,3.9849,1.5108,0.036,0.0747,0.1036,0.0005,0.0002,0.0946,2.6784,4.2457,1.1566,4.6567,2.1455,1.3791,1.8561,3.6909,4.6549,0.3689,3.2769,3.493,0.8003,0.1068,0.6181,1.4455,1.6713,0.7744,4.2701,5.7982,2.228,2.8217,1.6014,1.9866,0.0515,6.0906,2.6824,3.4702,1.0255,1.6649,0.1877,2.2365,0.4632,4.9379,1.7054,2.6076,4.8933,2.2098,6.4967,3.5923,2.9209,5.248,6.1939,7.5805,3.4036,0.0179,2.4814,5.6606,1.1636,0.4416,0.2608,5.4659,10.8086,3.3581,10.7205,7.7565,2.4518,7.6005,1.4659,1.5038,5.7742,0.5329,0.7351,1.2743,1.4362,1.9591,2.0413,2.1018,3.489,0.9459,2.2335,3.1929,0.7947,2.4014,5.0414,1.1277,0.3202,5.4397,4.6075,2.8181,3.7567,3.0652,0.266,6.6307,8.2244,0.011,2.8114,4.0525,5.4899,1.9036,0.887,7.0803,0.576,1.5998,2.4509,0.6558,0.9452,0.412,0.5695,3.2783,0.8749,0.112,0.18,0.0004,1.4508,0.0061,0.0065,0.0019,0.1286,7.3338,4.2535,4.0001,0.4844,2.8348,3.4119,0.7837,1.5282,4.2869,3.9226,1.7019,1.537,0.4609,2.4732,5.6146,3.5787,1.7333,4.0318,6.8778,3.0959,1.3965,2.481,4.1143,4.6623,3.2719,3.5844,1.3067,0.818,3.0079,1.6685,4.5357,1.905,3.9022,2.2195,4.6224,2.6023,0.9894,2.5555,1.867,1.9438,2.666,0.1413,4.0258,1.8149,2.2905,0.2415,0.7043,0.0423,1.049,6.4058,0.0303,1.2453,4.6421,1.4868,0.2312,0.8049,1.0805,3.6474,7.7346,0.6603,1.5387,2.3579,1.6699,1.7588,6.9973,5.1137,1.4536,2.4381,4.665,2.3324,4.3982,1.169,3.3816,7.9618,3.0308,0.0024,2.7224,0.1285,0.1075,0.7437,1.8505,2.379,1.1486,0.4009,3.3245,0.9798,6.933,4.1965,0.4094,3.3423,0.6376,0.7964,5.4588,3.254,3.9626,1.5491,0.7341,0.6024,3.1344,1.068,4.7816,1.061,0.9811,4.5436,3.2312,1.4971,5.4504,7.2839,0.0244,0.6268,2.7138,2.2649,0.3119,1.8438,6.0192,0.3247,0.4195,7.8668,5.9939,1.8851,2.5772,6.4188,5.2396,8.2706,0.0399,5.6688,0.7001,0.0002,3.3961,1.765,2.1879,0.4318,0.0641,0.0184,0.3144,1.6672,0.0097,0.0006,0.0841,0.0961,0.5505,2.4702,3.5979,1.8274,0.3908,1.5701,3.0069,10.5266,0.1051,6.6337,0.9325,6.3905,5.3709,0.0616,1.0838,8.2549,0.0004,2.4138,2.628,5.2427,0.0333,3.9091,6.461,1.6913,3.2971,1.221,1.1056,4.4392,0.7661,4.7947,0.0909,0.6691,7.3196,1.5614,5.7784,0.2359,0.7881,0.7168,6.1034,4.6192,0.3851,3.5637,15.3895,0.8018,2.8938,1.2995,3.0565,7.3878,5.9774,0.0874,3.8612,7.7932,2.43,3.7368,2.6717,0.4604,7.1503,1.301,7.956,5.1263,3.5697,5.3613,1.5448,4.2767,2.3802,0.0103,1.5204,3.4224,3.4567,1.3507,0.4605,0.2787,0.3596,5.5663,1.2232,4.4111,6.1504,6.8785,1.1181,5.4667,1.4057,2.7145,2.0378,1.722,1.4511,4.4207,1.6827,2.9855,1.9983,1.3144,4.7516,6.9111,0.0808,4.2478,3.5585,0.8209,5.8155,0.0019,1.474,2.3412,3.5724,7.0221,4.0666,0.5087,0.4793,0.0077,3.7946,0.7194,3.8496,1.4856,6.9981,5.1265,5.5181,6.3516,0.7565,5.5732,6.6407,1.8768,1.4841,2.4244,4.2592,0.5756,0.063,2.1969,1.986,3.764,1.4926,1.5853,7.0817,0.1915,2.3978,7.0377,1.7238,0.2919,1.5717,4.7575,7.2817,5.3925,4.7756,6.2906,1.3949,4.6636,1.2467,0.4608,0.712,0.289,2.3197,3.5233,2.2501,5.1889,1.1884,2.2678,0.6952,0.5827,4.8299,1.5554,4.2017,1.4236,1.8699,5.7421,6.7118,1.3844,1.3671,2.6879,1.5507,1.6513,1.613,4.1341,4.8217,2.8448,1.1501,3.1906,1.4929,1.8619,4.8446,4.2292,3.0418,1.1397,4.4518,2.606,6.0375,1.9397,3.298,4.7833,2.2287,0.5738,4.5314,3.6701,2.7781,4.499,5.4761,0.3514,0.3539,4.3836,3.2903,5.1897,2.8327,4.4913,3.6209,0.3441,0.8002,1.5904,10.7409,0.3146,2.2317,5.808,3.1863,0.33,3.2734,1.1367,6.0152,0.9791,0.504,4.2063,4.48,1.704,3.2033,1.6171,3.7276,5.104,2.3041,0.9285,0.8211,4.8581,0.7729,4.0184,1.2797,0.6103,2.4918,6.3739,0.9724,1.9126,2.4517,4.7926,3.2731,0.5707,1.0289,4.3306,2.9461,0.1025,4.8913,1.5601,0.5109,4.7857,2.0011,3.2675,2.3383,1.0388,2.7312,2.7548,5.3195,1.3853,1.9656,0.6106,5.5458,2.245,1.2684,8.146,0.0433,4.7589,0.9785,4.7729,0.9889,1.7985,3.2054,2.3102,2.0782,5.2166,1.2787,3.0524,2.3469,0.948,1.7183,0.2517]}
{"prompt":"The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) told a congressional committee on Tuesday he did not believe his predecessor Mary Jo White knew of a 2016 cyber breach to the","text":"The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) told a congressional committee on Tuesday he did not believe his predecessor Mary Jo White knew of a 2016 cyber breach to the agency, despite the fact that White had previously acknowledged that she had knowledge of such a breach ( The Hill, Aug 21, 2017, 8:13PM ). It appears to be significant that Mr. Yost used his final day in office to criticize, not his predecessor, but his two chief administrative officers, who the SEC has previously identified as the people responsible for the information technology controls that failed ( The Hill, Aug 20, 2017, 8:09PM ).\nIn my view, the current state of the relationship between the SEC and the Department of Justice is a sign of our country\u2019s continued failure to address fundamental weaknesses at the heart of our security and financial systems. The SEC recently passed an act that allows judges to appoint a judge-appointed trustee to manage its money, giving the SEC\u2019s financial system the same sort of oversight structure used in New York and Delaware\u2019s money markets. It also appears that the SEC chairman is working closely with the SEC\u2019s top financial crimes attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an effort to develop guidance on potential future actions in response to the attack on U.S. financial institutions. The Federal Reserve is also expected to take such a role. If the SEC were to use a trustee arrangement within the Federal Reserve, it would provide even greater accountability for the securities markets.\nIt is also important to remember that the chairman of the SEC has authority within his own administrative office to hire and fire any number of his employees. In his opening statement to the financial industry oversight committee, he stated that he had used this ability to hire the chief administrative officers of his office. That will allow the two chief administrative officers to go forward with any number of new initiatives, without having to wait for the commission to act in the traditional policymaking process, at least while the current chairman is in office.\nI expect the SEC to take a more proactive role when it comes to cyber threats within its own operation. The chair\u2019s statement to the committee also revealed that the SEC currently has less than 25 employees dedicated to this role. This compares with the FBI who has a dedicated field cyber unit with over 650 employees dedicated to protecting the financial system from cyber threats, including those that arise within the government itself.\nI have had the pleasure of working with the chairman of the SEC in the past and I have no doubt that his new office will take a stronger stance with its own cyber capabilities. The SEC should lead on cyber standards and initiatives designed to protect financial systems. The board deserves credit for taking such an important role in its efforts to combat financial crimes and promote an honest and professional industry. In my view, taking such an action now would go a long way toward promoting a better and robust cyber protections initiative as we move forward with the ongoing digital transformation of our financial system.","token_len":607,"entropy":[9.7351,0.2527,0.3611,4.6762,0.1488,0.197,0.0407,4.8018,0.0376,0.0022,0.0062,2.7795,8.2942,0.883,2.8356,2.7858,1.5744,0.9162,1.5262,1.5483,3.7237,4.3923,0.0243,1.5015,5.1428,4.5994,7.501,0.4864,0.0125,5.3961,1.5476,3.3119,7.001,3.8448,2.9334,5.2473,2.8627,4.5454,3.0302,3.6921,1.9228,1.004,0.317,2.5452,1.3478,3.0729,3.6055,1.6795,1.6471,1.0096,6.8573,0.3909,3.7135,0.6119,0.6206,6.1629,4.5698,2.7141,2.2964,4.7029,5.5692,0.4673,1.2025,2.9525,5.0666,0.0304,4.039,3.4942,3.0964,4.8159,3.8362,3.3515,0.5653,7.0446,1.4927,4.8749,0.1436,6.4766,4.9711,5.1534,1.763,7.8186,2.2594,1.2406,0.1035,0.4812,6.1511,6.4548,3.9195,6.1383,0.3069,0.3156,3.9704,1.8478,6.2837,5.1899,6.614,2.5072,1.1082,2.9631,5.3408,2.5996,2.5768,4.0909,4.3523,0.0829,3.3893,4.1674,1.5463,0.0272,1.9662,5.8372,6.555,8.2146,2.0689,6.7709,4.9572,1.2819,0.3079,0.0748,0.3067,2.8535,0.0109,0.0165,0.0072,1.4856,0.0005,3.8322,0.0295,0.21,1.3787,7.4898,6.5056,1.9282,0.1482,1.3828,4.9063,5.3215,0.0194,0.8995,6.5372,0.0956,0.7598,0.8925,0.0819,0.6322,3.1923,0.0468,0.2473,1.4404,2.7342,3.5921,0.6461,5.858,5.8908,13.9246,7.6818,6.095,4.2699,3.2357,0.195,3.4985,5.466,4.7328,4.9447,0.2149,1.6782,0.0007,1.0726,4.4168,1.7929,4.4734,1.4927,1.2424,2.2843,2.4016,6.356,4.7085,2.456,3.9513,1.3696,3.6271,6.7776,0.3768,4.6304,2.3812,5.0837,4.5775,0.7992,5.8999,0.6829,3.7857,4.7954,4.9116,2.9784,5.9102,0.9201,2.179,16.4586,0.125,0.01,4.1648,1.8769,2.2511,4.4742,5.0952,0.0004,2.5176,7.7459,5.6787,2.0929,6.0465,0.118,1.8412,6.3131,4.4752,0.0481,0.0321,5.5789,3.1536,0.7146,3.1475,1.7825,5.3672,0.9606,0.8398,1.4291,7.4819,2.3747,5.1824,3.9017,0.0224,1.1241,4.3123,5.266,0.0083,0.0022,3.388,3.1005,6.6372,5.0402,2.2051,2.656,4.4119,1.6304,0.0018,0.0083,3.5002,3.479,0.2056,0.0161,4.7762,5.1571,1.6819,5.7199,3.3332,2.9765,3.2604,2.873,0.0336,1.3339,6.5566,1.6876,3.6128,0.0123,0.0007,0.0019,0.9096,0.3193,0.9019,2.1414,5.7912,3.8532,2.6404,1.5037,3.5593,0.0117,3.4091,6.7494,1.7623,3.1534,2.2024,4.2879,1.1542,1.2335,3.6409,0.3445,4.336,3.0529,3.8002,5.0644,6.7423,0.5553,2.8352,0.0346,1.8461,1.1178,0.4956,3.7713,5.1824,0.7504,3.7184,1.5243,1.0483,5.6957,1.9061,1.4875,1.4286,3.7101,0.7151,2.1742,1.4005,0.0891,2.3975,0.1355,0.8573,5.7317,0.395,0.0628,1.2677,2.2256,5.4396,5.3188,2.0617,1.7719,7.2687,2.0503,0.4958,5.84,1.4681,0.5118,2.5194,5.0215,0.0005,5.7404,2.4323,1.2189,2.5582,3.2574,4.7791,1.0792,2.0463,0.7512,8.0093,2.3777,5.247,0.4616,1.0412,3.7635,2.492,0.4796,1.3383,1.8525,5.8768,2.2063,6.3987,0.5275,4.714,3.2315,3.4072,2.5991,2.4423,0.5398,2.7938,2.9195,2.2169,3.9431,5.6918,4.1962,0.954,5.902,2.6635,0.3524,0.0527,0.3356,5.6568,3.1256,1.0065,3.3863,5.7259,0.0029,4.0157,3.4698,2.2441,4.9411,1.6791,0.0579,3.9883,0.5764,0.8311,5.6838,0.2014,2.3333,4.0816,1.6632,6.6504,9.5201,2.597,3.1218,3.1731,5.5444,1.2696,5.7192,1.166,4.6008,3.7714,0.9305,1.0868,0.5632,0.2765,1.0341,3.8127,5.3031,1.4647,1.1254,1.7894,2.6565,2.0232,2.6513,2.3912,1.4025,3.6631,0.3604,0.1644,0.0059,4.4022,2.7311,5.6728,1.5276,2.3725,8.7884,0.6514,1.9487,6.0217,11.1929,0.1449,0.1027,6.4026,3.0402,0.4357,1.1547,3.6784,6.0427,0.4135,0.8311,0.9258,4.4099,0.8977,5.8105,0.3928,4.4425,1.1259,4.3491,0.0703,4.7066,2.7904,0.7513,2.5225,5.6104,1.1292,1.357,7.3813,5.4687,0.8959,3.601,5.4969,6.594,8.0872,3.5599,3.9958,2.8158,7.0889,0.8738,1.8825,0.0627,3.9337,1.1501,1.5536,0.9013,2.0036,0.4489,2.0123,2.3932,2.3837,3.107,1.833,5.0146,3.4553,0.3987,4.877,2.8688,0.3903,1.2359,2.6221,2.5972,5.2623,1.4466,0.9711,0.0862,1.2245,0.3121,1.3426,3.1977,0.2386,0.032,0.4745,2.4918,1.4382,0.2329,1.9735,1.6074,2.9444,2.8599,0.2371,0.3463,2.442,5.1745,4.7359,0.4174,3.8316,1.4257,4.1183,1.562,4.6332,4.617,3.7137,2.548,3.6948,0.6863,2.2776,1.7927,3.0646,6.4037,4.6314,2.4529,8.8681,1.1429,7.2947,5.8057,0.042,1.8663,3.1687,1.8032,2.0375,2.1104,3.9783,7.8434,2.3129,0.0417,2.8911,3.6838,2.1899,0.579,3.0679,1.3706,2.9066,3.4229,0.9792,3.696,3.1687,2.595,1.4704,6.0348,4.7562,4.6325,0.7617,4.9578,5.9598,0.3223,4.208,1.6118,0.2063,0.078,8.0032,1.4264,1.7206,4.6203,4.8147,1.1696,5.3281,0.1774,0.0091,0.0062,0.6014,5.4957,1.8634,2.7465,2.6763,7.9912,3.5708,7.4867,9.6246,4.8626,2.6287,1.8904,0.462,2.5839,1.3051,5.3142,5.5045,2.5571,0.8701,1.1247,0.4494,0.4544,0.1949]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed , the White House said on Friday","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Friday.\n\"I'm grateful for President Trump's confidence in me to run CFPB, and I've dedicated my career to ensuring consumers have access to fair and affordable loans,\" said Mulvaney in a statement. \"He'll nominate the next CFPB director after consultations in the coming days.\"\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) on Friday announced its plan to replace the Office of Inspector General with a new enforcement agency as part of its move to rein in enforcement of environmental regulations.\nThe Office of Investigations, now called the Office of Environmental Enforcement for Environmental Protection, is scheduled to be established in May.\nThe lawmakers said the proposal was aimed at protecting the \u201cfundamental rights\u201d under the U.S. Constitution and the \u201csecurity of the U.S. and the Nation by increasing transparency, accountability and integrity for government action and decisions.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department of Justice recognizes that there is much more to be done to ensure that the Justice Department is properly structured, focused and effective in its enforcement of environmental statutes. The Administration continues to pursue initiatives, and we will respond appropriately and effectively,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nThe new Office of Environmental Enforcement will address an issue that has been a significant challenge for environmental enforcement in recent years as environmental groups began criticizing the department in recent years.\nThe Office of Environmental Enforcement will replace the Office of Inspector General; now in its fifth secretary in the past three years, the inspector general has had a difficult time in defending his office\u2019s authority and integrity.\nIn the final report on the agency, released in April, a bipartisan group of senators criticized several of the actions and pronouncements made by the director. The report said the director overstepped his authority, failed to follow Department of Justice policy and \u201cdisplayed an unwillingness to pursue the prosecution of individuals.\u201d\n\u201cThe EPA does not have the proper processes and resources to implement an effective compliance program,\u201d the report said.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has also responded, saying EPA remains committed to enforcement of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\nThe Office of Inspector General was founded in 1975 to \u201cidentify agency problems, propose solutions, and improve the performance of the agency.\u201d\nThe office, which oversees many agencies, conducts independent investigations to assess the integrity and accountability of the executive branch.\nIn December, Trump nominated U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama and a lawmaker who favored tough environmental enforcement, to take the helm. The Trump administration has criticized the inspector general's work and accused the agency of under-reported data.\nTrump's most recent actions in response to environmental groups' complaints include cutting federal spending on science support and limiting access to government information.","token_len":607,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.9623,6.4423,8.8768,0.0406,7.9311,0.0842,0.0078,0.0004,0.0003,0.0,7.0694,1.4245,0.9699,0.1582,4.8837,0.0073,0.0,0.0063,6.9207,3.0162,4.3377,1.9053,0.7276,3.7095,4.1586,0.8059,2.4628,2.0867,1.5697,0.0005,0.6831,2.0692,1.6093,0.0855,0.1669,11.3634,3.7083,2.1053,5.1757,1.1843,3.6635,0.0847,0.0817,4.9698,0.5984,1.6358,1.615,5.2351,6.1504,0.0032,0.0001,2.1098,0.8755,0.7936,4.1955,6.0025,1.1624,2.2647,0.1307,2.3465,5.3542,1.6488,1.5684,0.0303,4.3733,0.8809,0.9901,5.4695,0.9225,2.3065,0.7545,0.0033,0.0006,1.5215,0.1018,0.1916,0.4002,0.9117,5.6589,4.1237,6.7975,3.3939,3.6161,0.8207,0.0025,0.0003,0.4171,4.2019,8.7583,5.3697,1.0357,2.3623,1.7013,1.1965,0.0404,13.5675,5.0179,0.0669,1.776,3.889,4.0882,0.0,0.06,3.7847,0.6291,1.8647,3.7634,3.4722,0.1227,3.0699,2.2865,4.74,0.0082,2.7409,0.0008,1.2552,0.6298,0.8978,7.0814,1.0453,5.7438,0.3619,0.001,1.7914,6.2603,0.2514,4.1285,0.1442,8.1148,0.6991,7.7792,1.0587,0.4228,0.4755,4.6776,4.4041,0.0698,6.9026,2.398,4.7254,2.4894,0.2237,1.4302,0.1348,3.815,3.275,7.0867,4.2444,0.9716,0.5993,1.3365,6.1654,0.0184,2.0798,3.3806,0.8704,3.1554,1.0387,0.8676,1.4628,10.2003,2.2071,1.1754,6.2217,2.9187,4.4746,0.1077,3.1841,1.9901,16.2535,8.1652,9.4338,0.0471,1.4014,3.4989,6.6213,5.3696,0.3147,4.1922,0.0006,0.0017,0.0058,0.6781,1.4826,1.3704,12.0835,0.5599,8.2677,0.8951,1.3412,3.3227,0.0006,0.002,0.0332,4.0692,2.281,5.3626,4.0002,5.9018,1.4511,1.7622,2.3285,0.4467,5.3819,3.3865,2.9073,6.3403,2.5414,4.7223,0.3609,9.5724,5.7951,0.2614,3.7368,2.1548,2.4075,3.0684,0.0875,0.6251,9.2771,0.6722,3.1319,0.9798,4.7965,1.6782,0.7912,1.8214,0.0399,0.9502,2.3448,1.2148,1.685,7.9862,0.0383,1.3788,4.1808,6.1601,1.2024,4.9503,0.4785,3.2752,1.2907,2.0007,2.804,1.146,1.359,5.2277,1.4674,2.0528,4.4452,4.6199,0.0509,3.5735,5.147,4.3196,3.8029,2.0503,1.7155,7.3773,3.1314,2.771,1.2328,2.4076,8.2827,2.8059,2.8062,4.1844,0.0027,0.2573,0.0009,1.029,0.2801,1.8347,3.5231,3.3029,0.0911,3.5259,0.0767,0.9553,5.1517,4.2464,3.0479,0.7682,0.9508,1.173,2.3299,4.6572,2.9874,0.7535,3.9277,2.5056,1.5637,1.4266,0.1012,4.2351,4.5429,2.6573,5.1371,5.8121,0.4968,4.1831,4.5081,2.5845,1.1922,0.8332,0.8692,1.6396,3.3225,0.1004,2.6056,0.0698,2.0527,5.0783,0.3738,1.4955,0.0277,1.2035,0.0027,7.3687,6.5925,6.3496,1.0527,3.1315,11.9113,4.7392,2.7832,2.9721,2.5994,0.1841,0.742,1.1537,4.457,0.0548,2.0112,4.776,1.7111,4.5688,1.0754,3.6086,6.7044,5.3124,2.9033,9.4443,6.3146,4.9369,4.284,2.2662,3.6934,0.8197,1.0521,3.1694,2.6261,5.0579,4.1127,2.7196,1.1388,2.9701,1.429,2.6894,1.6099,2.6333,0.1457,4.5114,3.9399,0.2912,0.3291,1.9881,4.0604,6.7578,1.9183,0.2971,3.6432,3.4903,9.3492,0.0023,2.4807,0.2635,0.5624,3.5757,2.0875,2.105,1.8064,2.4917,1.1947,2.634,6.1515,0.5305,0.0007,0.2546,0.2323,2.5245,3.8662,0.0243,2.6627,3.9528,1.8779,0.4792,2.7085,0.8617,11.2204,0.7115,7.0571,2.6089,2.3782,2.0484,0.1237,4.8463,2.9921,8.2988,0.1048,3.7715,3.6786,3.8839,2.1251,0.3603,1.759,0.1131,0.8638,5.9722,4.6272,0.1593,1.3516,0.8173,6.6697,4.9729,1.8947,3.9419,0.2087,4.6027,3.806,1.1524,4.8133,0.7092,1.5813,1.3921,2.4591,1.3493,0.643,0.4543,0.1423,0.804,1.321,4.8577,0.1985,0.0014,3.059,3.3142,6.475,4.8971,2.1986,6.6848,7.4527,0.6346,0.0136,4.8834,0.7184,2.0396,0.6189,1.0298,0.012,1.089,2.0952,0.3906,0.051,0.0149,0.8139,0.5555,1.3689,3.7784,0.0178,0.8108,0.0012,3.1876,4.8374,0.4069,4.0403,1.6214,13.387,0.1126,4.0691,0.0018,5.6226,4.0574,1.8258,8.2043,0.8915,1.3101,0.2963,3.9805,1.7423,3.0947,0.1094,1.0178,0.5578,0.5974,3.3332,0.6623,0.9387,1.3803,3.8479,4.0988,0.6627,3.5987,5.0486,2.7175,0.6973,4.8618,3.8292,1.7569,3.2588,3.3751,1.7245,3.3741,1.4988,4.3003,0.0168,1.2074,5.5615,0.0786,0.9877,1.1828,3.1285,3.83,0.6348,4.1819,2.5079,5.2885,0.001,0.0028,0.002,0.7471,0.0642,0.0874,0.0008,3.2865,1.3225,2.0007,2.9317,0.034,3.6247,0.8424,10.1096,2.51,7.5162,7.0576,1.4065,1.8009,1.4977,0.3472,4.6751,1.8053,1.6736,1.5988,2.2392,3.8005,0.3734,1.1737,5.1757,0.8746,4.0715,0.0019,1.6859,1.6989,1.7296,4.9468,1.1571,1.3549,0.0453,4.0451,2.5077,6.0072,5.7056,1.4458,0.4092,3.889,1.6788,7.1093,0.3967,3.2596,3.1857,3.3083,0.1255,2.3897,5.0697,2.1353,2.0187,2.1601,5.0393,3.6005,3.725,0.822,5.7109,7.0765,1.5577,5.5633,3.8641,0.05,4.7719,3.4272,0.875]}
{"prompt":"The top U.N. human rights official voiced concern on Monday at the Trump administration \u2019 s decision to end the DACA program for immigrants who arrived illegally as children and urged the U.S. Congress to","text":"The top U.N. human rights official voiced concern on Monday at the Trump administration \u2019 s decision to end the DACA program for immigrants who arrived illegally as children and urged the U.S. Congress to find a pathway to citizenship for them.\nMr. Sessions said that \u201cunder DACA, these individuals (immigrants) are here legally and have a right to seek citizenship.\u201d\nMr. Sessions also said that DACA has helped protect the United States from \u201cthousands of criminal activities that otherwise would have been committed by young people who entered the country illegally and then took advantage of our generous immigration laws, which DACA allows.\u201d\nUnder Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, DACA recipients would be allowed to work in the United States for up to two years, while they prepare to apply for and receive permanent permission to live and work permanently in the United States.\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned,\u201d Mr. Zeid said after Mr. Sessions. \u201cAt an era where our country is under such serious attack by extremists and terrorists, I\u2019m concerned that when a president begins attacking the heart of our country, this puts our country at great risk of serious and fatal violence that would be even more destructive than what we saw early this year.\u201d\nThe announcement came after Mr. Trump said in an interview broadcast earlier Monday on CBS News that he had asked Mr. Sessions to stop the program \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d\nSeveral conservative commentators and critics of Democrat Barack Obama have defended Mr. Trump \u2019 s decision. They argued that, similar to legislation that protects some undocumented immigrants from deportation, the DACA program offers benefits without requiring immigrants to pay taxes.\nMr. Trump \u2019 s remarks sparked outrage from many Democrats and in the U.S. Senate on Monday night, where Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ms. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and other Democrats urged Mr. Sessions to rescind the executive action, saying they would file legislation to reinstate the program.\nRepublicans on the Republican-controlled Congress, meanwhile, have long opposed the DACA program, which has protected from deportation some 650,000 young immigrants brought to the United States as children, many from Central America and the Caribbean.\nThe program is supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Immigration Coalition and the National Immigration Law Center, among others.\nIt was introduced in 2009 to enable an estimated 800,000 Dreamers, youth of some 600,000 eligible adults who had come to the United States as children, to stay in the country with legal work authorization. Dreamers are called DACA immigrants.\nThe DACA program did not have a lawful basis under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the immigration laws of the United States.\nThe program was funded by the American taxpayers through an executive order of President George W. Bush, with the annual budget allocation of $25 million set by Congress and appropriated each year.","token_len":608,"entropy":[6.6897,5.7813,0.0244,4.6631,0.0193,2.9212,0.0251,2.7377,7.0633,1.1497,3.3926,1.7629,3.8911,0.7824,5.8371,0.0611,16.7598,8.4821,7.8807,3.243,0.2856,4.0808,1.0181,5.6165,0.0584,2.8019,4.7834,1.0938,2.2032,3.3804,2.1541,0.0646,2.302,6.5895,1.1524,1.6051,0.0006,0.3489,0.0058,3.4953,0.1353,6.5237,0.7763,6.5581,0.2617,0.1615,0.6564,2.9628,0.2527,0.4635,19.9217,0.0728,4.693,1.9639,2.3007,10.5872,5.6267,7.7251,6.5769,0.5642,5.6248,3.8001,6.5543,4.3869,0.001,0.6327,2.1755,6.1843,1.8463,1.392,2.599,2.2309,0.6549,0.0995,3.5205,2.5556,1.9162,3.7903,7.4051,2.0242,9.727,0.0008,0.9769,2.1445,1.1716,0.4036,3.6699,3.5419,3.4988,4.1614,2.3185,3.2341,0.0011,0.5303,14.1495,1.2904,5.939,0.0677,0.1387,3.8736,6.9743,1.9948,5.3045,0.3389,0.6335,0.8528,5.4157,0.7366,5.3203,0.9179,1.7777,3.3446,0.203,0.4678,0.7653,2.7086,3.6884,5.4536,1.2235,0.0101,4.892,4.0745,1.7205,2.1755,2.8747,2.6757,8.5464,2.9895,1.0994,2.3724,0.5192,0.3033,5.7766,2.5516,0.0003,0.7601,4.9612,2.5727,0.3149,1.7741,0.2804,3.0204,0.9747,1.2106,0.6441,2.0898,0.1116,1.8836,1.8476,0.3321,0.489,0.0005,2.1063,1.1202,0.0006,2.6059,0.0441,1.26,3.8293,2.1766,8.033,1.0111,1.5308,0.1235,3.1448,0.5789,3.5698,6.7272,0.4647,3.7568,0.4106,0.0332,4.6665,0.253,0.1109,0.3257,0.0005,0.2422,0.7158,2.8613,2.2575,6.8371,7.0071,4.9495,2.3273,5.3842,0.4426,4.7546,3.7861,1.3555,3.0075,0.001,12.8454,1.0721,1.3833,5.3112,2.6604,0.0007,0.4737,6.3603,2.7935,0.6394,5.049,4.2299,8.2912,2.729,3.0407,1.8143,0.708,3.8092,5.0254,4.1035,3.1563,2.9431,5.1921,1.9308,2.2671,0.5389,3.7099,2.848,2.1945,2.2976,2.8237,0.7933,5.8653,3.3176,1.8841,5.9348,6.8156,2.028,5.0294,0.3637,0.7387,0.9958,0.6046,4.2439,6.0233,1.485,0.6897,0.9339,4.9273,0.0663,2.5855,4.1244,2.9961,5.4463,4.3153,3.8468,2.7186,2.3941,4.9711,0.6128,3.6156,1.2873,1.3021,1.4613,3.0856,6.1593,1.8204,0.5985,1.0295,1.6505,0.7775,0.2486,2.8504,5.2434,2.0034,1.8832,1.907,0.0009,0.7294,2.929,2.0956,1.8865,0.0858,5.3844,5.1978,2.4265,3.6478,3.788,2.0549,0.6103,0.6295,2.6631,3.2686,2.9767,0.0004,0.2131,0.4297,4.123,1.5969,0.8651,3.9078,1.9934,4.1406,1.1906,5.7929,0.7173,2.416,0.0203,4.6695,4.8111,0.7318,2.5638,0.4161,0.611,6.6462,4.856,2.8275,2.555,4.931,1.3659,9.7495,4.2438,0.0029,2.1331,6.5633,0.8425,0.0004,1.1472,3.6643,0.5192,3.9749,1.0277,2.1962,4.5943,3.4066,0.101,4.4684,8.3223,0.0041,7.9552,2.0574,5.4443,4.5497,1.6829,0.2154,1.3275,0.1283,0.3075,1.7329,2.7464,0.2403,4.8222,4.26,6.3524,4.0463,4.8826,0.193,1.323,0.6718,0.499,0.4353,3.1822,0.0011,1.1715,2.7616,0.0891,0.4736,5.2166,4.8291,2.446,1.5169,2.7283,3.4576,1.1232,5.2598,1.89,3.7532,0.0008,0.0262,0.0332,1.9104,3.853,0.4602,3.3523,1.2179,4.1183,2.5133,4.1687,0.0005,1.6064,0.0712,0.263,0.5089,0.0015,1.7211,7.1958,0.0017,6.6921,0.0005,0.0067,0.0731,0.0056,0.0059,0.0044,1.081,0.0762,2.6454,1.1357,4.8274,0.7889,0.0005,0.4291,0.1832,2.858,0.51,3.9081,1.8856,2.7463,1.6292,3.2602,1.932,5.5621,3.458,0.7153,3.7477,0.616,0.7686,0.1286,0.568,0.2695,6.3414,2.4404,0.5864,5.9652,2.0293,1.069,3.5429,2.5568,2.0794,0.005,1.5868,4.6144,2.412,1.1299,2.5332,0.0983,1.116,1.7827,2.3606,5.2769,6.9175,0.332,2.909,6.0833,0.0129,0.0024,1.9714,1.496,3.4638,0.2489,0.051,0.6365,0.0012,0.9395,0.0423,2.6902,1.853,2.8218,0.7609,0.2373,1.6209,1.9015,0.3738,0.2799,0.497,2.1245,3.493,2.1205,5.6079,0.1179,1.2875,3.3945,2.9588,0.0014,0.0037,0.9937,0.997,6.3477,0.2923,4.7335,3.1105,0.7668,0.965,1.941,0.6668,0.1531,0.1038,1.5329,1.521,0.2842,0.1167,0.5668,4.9934,2.0536,4.0627,0.7838,3.2332,2.8798,6.2611,5.262,0.9825,3.2027,0.0393,0.0016,5.2925,0.0295,2.0736,8.503,2.1792,6.0119,5.1189,0.2081,0.0027,4.7916,5.0868,1.9045,2.7184,1.9142,0.132,0.0626,0.3204,0.0007,0.9094,0.0746,0.8604,0.3409,3.1727,0.3044,0.1005,0.7381,4.6782,2.4018,5.6076,2.6708,0.9833,5.9563,0.0098,1.8774,6.5395,3.9134,4.9616,1.4536,0.4347,1.8695,3.7238,0.0887,6.0613,0.0566,3.7707,1.2909,5.812,4.1949,4.2453,0.8441,2.2118,0.2473,0.0149,0.001,0.002,0.8596,2.6695,4.2768,2.4529,0.9442,0.4397,0.4326,0.007,0.921,1.0435,1.9813,2.2478,1.5561,6.1394,0.7117,0.9022,4.6809,4.9947,2.4327,2.9232,3.9735,0.5674,4.2128,0.6412,1.9193,0.0193,0.0017,0.0011,1.6121,4.7797,1.2135,8.2393,2.0071,6.4235,1.6772,0.3466,4.476,1.216,5.874,1.1239,0.7755,3.1482,3.9248,5.0972,0.0924,0.9574]}
{"prompt":"Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on Wednesday edged ahead of his TV star rival in a contentious vote count that has dragged on for three days . With 81.77 percent of the ballot boxes counted","text":"Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on Wednesday edged ahead of his TV star rival in a contentious vote count that has dragged on for three days. With 81.77 percent of the ballot boxes counted, Hernandez had won by an 18.2 percentage point margin over his opponent, a former pop star. With a final count expected in the evening, television ratings in Honduras are set to spike during a news night that will air results and coverage of a second vote count tomorrow. The Honduran electoral commission had stopped the count on Wednesday, following complaints from Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s campaign that they had not allowed time to count votes from the rural, rural and other isolated areas of Honduras that Hern\u00e1ndez won by a bigger margin. The commission later stopped the counting of votes on Wednesday due to technical difficulties that had emerged after the election. Earlier in the day, the count stopped after Honduran National Electoral Tribunal Chairman David Matamoros said they had not found enough documents to carry out a second count. Matamoros said the tribunal would count the initial tally in case there was a disputed result and a new election was needed. The Commission said it would wait until the end of the day to do the count again as a precaution. Voting for the second round of Honduran presidential elections started at 9:30 p.m. local time, but by 11:30 the polls had opened in a small village outside Tegucigalpa capital. The campaign had been stopped early the day before after some residents raised concerns about safety and security. The second round would determine the winner of the May 1 vote, which Hernandez lost by a small margin. An opinion poll released in May by pollster Gallup that was quoted widely suggested Hernandez would eventually win by a narrow margin. \u201cWe are on the safe path to victory,\u201d Hernandez told reporters after voting during the third and final day of electioneering Wednesday. \u201cWe are in the first stages. We are going to see in the evening how are things.\u201d He said the campaign had been stopped to allow time for more votes to be counted. He said his staff would have given the final tally \u201cafter noon\u201d and that no one would have access to the actual ballot until the final counting. Hern\u00e1ndez won the May 18 first round of the contested, run-off vote \u2014 which took place in Tegucigalpa in two separate days \u2014 by a margin of 16.6%. He was seeking the presidency as the winner of the first round against Salvador Nasralla, a former pop star whose camp accused Hernandez of rigging the race.

The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements. Twitter and Reuters have reached no agreement in relation to its policies, the president said, adding :\nAnd he continues : Reuters has \u201c not made progress on this issue, and does not intend to.\u201d It is his call, he said, to be responsible, not be controlled.\nCNN is reporting the comments as a sign \u2013 a signal \u2013 in the president\u2019s mind, that his Twitter account will close soon, possibly due to the revelation a few days ago that a reporter from the BBC in Russia had sought information from the White House about WikiLeaks. According to the CNN report, the White House reportedly told the BBC that Trump was \u201c upset \u201d with the reporter. According to the Guardian newspaper, the tweet has not been written in full by the president, but was prepared, and the president then typed. That it may not have been the president himself who sent the tweet. According to a report in the U.K. newspaper The Guardian newspaper, a statement from the White House later on Friday revealed that the president gave the BBC\u2019s reporter a \u201c direct signal \u201d that he would be considering restricting access to reporters and that he would discuss it shortly with his administration. According to the report, the statement says \u201c there is no indication of anything formal or definitive \u201d but in addition notes that the statement was posted on the president\u2019s verified Twitter account. The Guardian added that the British Foreign Office, the British Embassy in Washington, and the U.K. Treasury are monitoring the situation. The Trump administration recently said the U.N.\u2019s International Criminal Court had been asked to investigate war crimes in Syria. In addition to the International Criminal Court, Trump has also said he might consider removing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council after a long battle with U.S. allies, some of whom have criticized the Human Rights Council for a number of issues. According to The Guardian, U.S. allies have also been alarmed over Trump\u2019s position on refugees, accusing him of being unreliable on the issue of refugees.\nIn addition, Trump tweeted that the U.S. should get out of Europe in order to cut off the source of NATO and the EU. \u201c We should get out of Europe, \u201d he said. \u201c I don\u2019t want to spend 40 \u2013 50 Billion $ per year helping Europe, and the NRA will never spend it, and they would rather not spend a dime on it. \u201c Last week, Trump was criticized by some members of the U.S. Congress who said the U.S. may have to give up the current coalition with Europe and NATO because Donald Trump\u2019s attitude toward the European Union is an \u201c unreliable ally,\u201d.","token_len":609,"entropy":[7.2906,6.1509,1.6094,5.1922,2.2298,1.4007,10.3533,2.5742,3.002,0.3661,6.5793,0.6589,0.0604,0.0377,2.7618,0.7475,0.0352,2.1855,6.8098,12.1442,0.0422,1.2892,0.3752,4.9874,0.011,1.2774,2.9391,6.5301,0.1177,1.0814,2.6325,0.4469,0.6392,6.9055,2.4984,1.1834,8.2564,1.397,3.7112,1.3805,7.4401,3.8269,5.7395,1.339,4.8575,5.7513,3.0734,4.7835,5.5804,0.0526,5.898,4.2877,2.6782,4.478,4.785,2.2533,2.1875,1.8453,7.1327,2.9638,13.863,4.1305,5.2768,2.9888,8.4441,1.9988,11.3872,7.4937,4.4053,3.7507,7.2514,0.9805,2.8416,1.429,1.958,1.603,4.9256,0.0451,3.008,0.0888,2.0288,6.8162,8.5948,4.3683,1.0244,5.6099,5.312,2.2909,3.114,0.4648,0.7304,1.7244,4.5878,5.3995,2.7179,2.4112,4.5848,6.6712,1.2016,1.994,7.5716,3.4701,2.4152,3.0584,4.3413,2.1268,2.0093,5.2927,9.5193,4.3015,5.2957,2.7224,6.4182,1.7401,3.9696,9.7704,7.7888,1.4659,2.1279,2.7327,2.6558,2.7695,4.2133,1.1429,3.15,6.0299,2.534,1.9834,4.8492,4.9447,0.0429,1.7451,7.4543,6.1181,2.2908,0.5599,0.3839,0.2479,3.4385,4.0849,3.1921,1.3951,4.8246,4.9717,3.4081,0.7624,5.4126,5.1864,1.6983,1.3615,1.7166,0.0007,1.0997,7.5444,1.0088,5.3852,0.0015,1.4958,3.3761,0.4673,0.1652,1.2682,2.8288,0.0014,5.5505,2.6819,1.6815,0.7962,1.0528,3.3585,1.9761,11.959,1.2511,8.195,3.4681,3.5957,3.7656,1.0847,4.2331,2.1724,5.0203,0.002,1.172,4.7029,4.459,0.2516,1.0852,3.1761,3.9041,3.6285,0.4917,8.8357,3.5,3.7038,2.3892,0.7909,0.6191,1.4844,1.0255,3.0962,6.8989,4.5885,2.0469,2.5167,2.6307,5.1222,7.9093,4.8194,5.3368,5.4735,4.0541,2.2295,1.929,0.1962,3.7873,3.0131,2.7909,2.4926,2.2594,0.8157,0.38,3.397,5.1707,0.0019,3.0539,3.1764,1.7312,0.8176,6.2581,0.0032,0.7281,1.1492,1.3873,0.535,1.151,3.7386,1.0257,3.1118,5.7672,0.9865,0.7281,0.3103,0.0018,5.074,3.0741,2.3873,6.2228,0.3698,1.0237,1.9591,6.6876,0.983,1.3175,13.4056,2.9554,0.0214,2.4139,1.4223,11.5397,1.0703,8.8872,6.5874,0.9287,0.5639,0.9022,0.951,1.5693,2.6082,6.959,7.831,1.2968,0.1162,5.2031,2.6755,4.3244,1.3965,1.4294,6.4751,2.0819,7.2243,1.5171,2.93,4.0579,0.5013,4.3809,0.0021,0.593,2.2311,0.1277,0.8219,4.1223,5.5155,4.9526,0.7342,5.3124,1.355,0.8467,2.7023,2.3243,4.8194,5.8263,1.6531,4.3916,2.3978,0.3068,4.0088,5.8054,4.9247,8.4559,0.3575,1.2655,4.7846,1.6381,4.7013,1.45,1.5428,2.4738,2.051,0.2508,0.0091,5.5644,0.2778,0.0471,0.985,1.7924,2.5823,4.0679,0.5254,1.0285,6.8298,4.0506,0.1565,3.309,2.3495,2.8629,1.995,0.4004,1.876,0.7273,0.8328,0.5456,2.3543,0.0004,1.1929,0.5345,6.4047,2.364,4.8307,0.3753,1.5882,0.7534,2.3061,4.1594,0.6082,5.9455,3.1644,3.076,3.1721,0.0006,3.8327,0.0724,11.0693,1.6072,0.0593,5.891,2.3305,0.0728,3.0651,3.2052,3.7939,0.2186,1.0901,8.5542,0.0071,1.6176,1.533,1.2488,3.9,3.2386,1.0389,0.9984,8.0616,0.1285,0.0198,0.3019,4.0441,1.0252,1.7342,3.3493,1.1895,4.8438,2.2956,5.7078,1.4522,1.322,0.0006,0.3039,0.0772,0.5849,0.1595,3.7977,0.0006,0.0899,0.1415,3.0725,0.0073,0.0594,4.1789,2.7976,5.251,4.4682,1.15,6.111,0.0003,0.1498,0.2545,3.3598,2.0404,5.6474,0.1008,0.2993,1.5553,3.3518,1.4134,5.5008,0.0066,0.0416,0.7302,5.2092,4.1248,0.0006,3.2691,0.7445,4.7843,0.001,2.7926,1.681,0.3226,4.3662,0.0004,0.2298,0.0205,4.8207,1.2801,2.3766,2.8224,4.8868,3.7216,2.9899,2.9549,0.1498,0.0019,5.9737,0.4824,4.7491,1.5009,5.5433,0.4215,0.0368,3.0446,8.5505,2.7804,0.8598,0.214,4.9014,1.0936,0.8343,1.313,3.6302,2.8455,1.4984,2.6922,3.3284,2.0351,1.6497,2.0847,0.0006,0.5931,0.0373,2.1256,5.1434,2.4248,0.0678,5.7681,4.5151,0.911,0.0713,5.9021,1.564,2.5766,5.9355,0.0273,6.0215,4.5066,2.256,3.025,2.1096,6.9369,0.8423,4.844,2.1648,1.8444,0.1812,0.4069,1.5172,2.2662,5.9281,3.7864,1.4419,0.5795,0.7211,2.1687,0.6234,3.8919,2.9303,3.6264,3.9899,0.0706,1.5216,0.434,6.1243,6.1562,9.0206,0.3465,8.9028,8.3289,4.9868,0.2687,6.7116,3.1316,1.7111,2.9485,3.6959,9.9576,3.3967,3.1924,5.5145,2.8393,2.2241,2.3565,2.8857,3.776,3.1194,3.8064,2.048,4.6763,2.22,1.4624,2.1822,0.6809,1.7488,0.6047,8.2159,1.6478,0.5871,3.1016,3.9661,3.8675,1.2659,2.3054,3.1657,0.0174,1.1519,3.0778,0.0006,0.5331,0.0375,0.9944,3.1145,1.3385,2.2021,1.4039,0.0005,0.01,0.0294,6.0823,2.2491,1.0472,4.4481,0.4885,2.4312,7.3529,8.6362,3.4735,3.5238,2.3174,3.6177,3.4082,6.793,0.0781,4.4971,0.3354,0.0045,6.337,1.2794,1.7293,2.5243,0.0588,1.2136,5.0109,12.1412,1.1151,8.1391,2.8637,2.6681,4.3302,1.2288,6.23]}

AFP understands they were allegedly held in the same facility with others.\nThe two journalists were part of a team of seven journalists who had gone to Myanmar to investigate alleged human rights violations against ethnic minorities in the impoverished Southeast Asian country.\nDuring the visit, they interviewed a local business consultant who allegedly had collaborated with military intelligence in a campaign of ethnic violence.\nThe two journalists posted a video on Feb. 17 of the beating that came after a confrontation between two lawyers and members of the military.\n\u201cIn the presence of military authorities, the two media workers were beaten and verbally abused,\u201d the U.S. State Department said.\nThe government of Myanmar has denied its involvement and accused the journalists of fabricating the attack against them with the help of militants.\nThe state of Rakhine has been embroiled in a protracted war against militants who have killed many ethnic minority civilians.\nMyanmar has seen protests against the military take place since February and protesters accuse the government of erecting a secretive junta with military-backed politicians.

REUTERS\/Aung Zaw\/File\nSome protesters have also joined the online revolution and taken to social media to call for a national shutdown, saying life would be in greater danger outside of the country.\nHuman Rights Watch said last weekend that the authorities had detained or suspended their operations at about 130 local media organizations.\nA Reuters article said it had been able to confirm around 100 locations of media organizations that had been closed, and said a recent crackdown had forced some to work with only a handful of journalists.\nA spokesman for the Myanmar Department of Information denied reports that the journalists had been detained on account of their coverage of the protests, saying, though, that they were investigating violence committed against civilian demonstrators. He declined to comment on the journalists\u2019 arrests on their own account.\nMeanwhile, one of the journalists\u2019 friends said that he had been able to speak to his friend after more than a month in detention, but said he would not speak publicly on his condition.\nU.S. President Joe Biden has said he is calling for the release of all human rights activists and journalists in Myanmar.","token_len":609,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2865,0.0161,4.9847,1.8067,5.6635,1.0269,1.872,4.84,1.2054,0.0125,4.3897,8.735,0.4891,1.1068,2.8939,0.3382,1.5872,3.1999,6.0889,1.6004,0.9735,0.9605,4.1054,3.0433,4.097,2.252,1.6172,0.6296,0.1121,4.1789,5.3092,5.6521,1.2187,0.2542,0.3182,20.9947,3.2647,8.2203,11.404,0.844,5.8429,1.9412,2.3267,1.3672,4.3982,2.7717,6.1081,1.9514,4.2623,3.3108,1.0914,2.9654,5.9972,3.4344,3.5279,0.0549,6.7005,1.9037,3.639,0.4893,1.3676,2.9209,2.2872,1.3172,7.6121,0.0048,2.7192,0.4098,0.3792,5.5625,1.8767,0.4017,4.8798,1.367,6.7049,0.0266,0.1045,0.0422,3.5521,6.8929,7.8088,0.1986,0.2438,8.5273,0.7765,0.1296,4.8138,0.7571,16.0987,7.9476,7.2727,9.1933,2.2069,1.1343,0.4889,1.609,1.7789,2.2912,4.8502,0.1988,12.4964,5.1527,8.368,0.4587,2.4097,4.2987,1.3921,8.068,1.0938,6.3531,0.1245,6.2821,0.865,5.2433,3.2387,1.2301,1.211,2.0439,6.9064,5.9101,1.8007,1.624,5.102,3.5401,1.2993,2.2143,3.4353,3.6744,4.4439,4.3248,3.1042,0.179,1.5232,2.897,0.6984,1.2359,5.6368,0.0011,0.5042,1.5566,1.5914,4.9009,0.8222,1.2529,3.1568,5.2772,0.4255,1.5977,0.716,2.2902,2.6467,1.8869,0.056,1.1044,4.5005,4.0676,2.6857,0.8487,0.6296,5.085,4.7674,0.1227,1.1118,0.3967,0.4332,5.9867,1.3284,3.3551,0.3668,2.7298,5.6786,3.4659,3.4877,6.6838,7.2434,1.4516,4.2472,2.5253,7.0838,0.0666,4.5554,4.7373,2.4041,2.5402,2.8582,1.6065,2.8928,3.399,1.3036,0.4258,1.5149,2.6773,0.3649,7.9895,1.9097,0.8274,1.1026,8.1358,0.0425,1.8875,2.1738,1.7487,7.2607,3.5044,5.8955,2.0957,2.3233,6.2844,0.7062,2.3746,8.5413,1.3356,4.1543,0.0019,0.6495,1.7397,1.1122,0.6172,4.9657,1.1995,3.9042,1.2296,9.1002,0.0037,3.1551,4.2932,0.4698,1.1726,1.413,6.7493,3.3296,1.1574,2.0359,1.7697,6.533,0.6202,2.0908,8.5538,4.6454,1.969,3.9739,0.0006,0.0482,0.0993,0.442,0.0023,0.2671,0.8624,0.3293,1.1093,4.1784,2.9517,0.5902,1.2687,2.0607,5.2177,1.0971,3.0573,3.0175,0.6893,0.9827,0.1595,5.8009,0.0021,1.443,3.2376,4.8054,1.6801,5.6715,1.4487,0.6169,0.0021,5.5547,0.7871,0.306,1.2895,4.992,4.5611,5.4056,0.0233,0.0006,2.6806,2.3228,3.5565,0.0084,0.6444,4.1075,2.6403,3.3986,3.6839,2.0582,0.9048,3.6412,4.5383,3.3481,2.3852,2.9043,1.7105,0.7706,7.4196,0.0001,1.4456,5.191,4.3686,2.5317,0.8038,1.0752,6.8294,1.3761,3.2863,3.6132,2.8357,6.8153,3.3086,0.4773,1.4471,0.0663,9.4642,0.0006,1.4457,8.956,7.5515,0.0007,3.8172,2.4225,3.247,0.7083,4.943,1.5993,2.8024,5.0632,3.7051,0.7576,0.599,4.324,3.9155,0.0095,0.0169,0.1615,0.5609,4.9943,0.1508,0.0171,0.0033,0.707,0.4907,1.8879,2.3813,1.4667,5.0402,5.2464,0.9723,0.3978,3.7428,5.1739,4.4867,4.3867,7.4661,2.2601,5.0939,1.851,4.335,3.2075,1.1928,6.2785,0.0293,11.8097,2.8494,1.0217,3.729,0.1265,0.3288,0.2093,0.0118,1.0624,4.6504,3.5409,0.0136,13.0903,0.0648,0.2764,0.0204,3.2641,2.9627,8.5097,4.4675,14.5403,1.3632,4.2553,5.2475,4.2301,0.921,2.1846,5.0057,1.3116,8.3945,6.7849,3.3416,4.1916,0.2926,2.0433,0.0277,0.4398,2.4326,0.2857,1.96,3.8039,7.643,4.1283,2.2039,9.2448,2.3157,0.2174,4.2784,7.7064,0.4665,7.6475,2.448,0.6495,1.7279,0.9581,0.3882,6.1294,1.1705,0.0075,1.2464,4.2295,5.6218,0.3584,2.1792,5.9438,1.1218,1.9233,6.0771,5.6247,6.7215,5.6596,3.3337,4.6229,5.9314,6.6115,0.8764,6.6286,2.0584,0.4977,3.6779,2.2763,5.3223,2.7851,4.3618,1.0357,1.663,5.5407,0.0074,2.7479,7.8801,2.5346,8.0251,2.3398,1.9499,4.4035,2.6801,1.0641,0.3061,2.1404,2.6547,2.3274,2.5875,4.1175,7.1848,3.382,1.2316,3.2882,2.0167,1.186,6.854,3.8083,8.3267,1.6656,1.3141,0.1027,1.6773,0.4944,0.2831,3.4054,2.3166,0.0821,0.6102,1.8577,5.602,0.0273,2.5322,8.2179,2.9159,0.7335,0.9703,2.1686,0.6104,0.1596,0.5531,4.1432,7.1049,0.0047,1.0467,3.9145,0.2504,0.8704,3.0059,1.9345,1.0397,4.2126,8.109,1.4353,0.6456,2.2546,1.1233,6.9171,8.3799,5.08,2.6797,5.6167,5.0758,0.465,4.457,2.7326,0.1559,1.0831,0.8146,1.1449,3.8611,9.1505,3.7736,7.0372,4.9896,2.4589,3.874,3.1196,0.425,0.1694,7.9112,0.0763,5.7761,1.0049,0.1864,1.0951,4.6732,1.3668,9.8115,3.6604,2.5009,1.7144,0.9152,0.5839,6.3511,0.0065,3.6955,0.6953,2.3547,3.1843,3.3351,7.4252,0.067,1.0549,1.4766,1.1939,0.4985,1.8141,1.5336,2.7206,0.8564,3.242,0.7098,2.1139,2.6877,4.062,2.1239,3.7908,0.5512,0.3523,4.7976,0.1636,0.2068,0.1114,2.6597,9.8152,0.316,2.4533,2.0234,0.9954,2.2581,5.7835,0.6191,1.8793,1.1479,0.016,3.4362,6.2689,0.0067,2.5981,2.86,1.9251,2.139,0.27,1.3086]}

It is yet another signal about the state of affairs in Iran in this final week of the Trump presidency as the U.S. negotiates to keep its nuclear deal with the world powers alive. It now seems that Iranian leaders \u2013 including the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 have lost their grip on the country \u2013 as evidenced by Trump\u2019s victory last night.\nAs noted by Foreign Policy, \u201cMr. Trump has done so well in so many areas,\u201d that it \u201chas come as no surprise that the people of Iran, who for decades were denied a voice in the national politics, turned out in record numbers for Sunday\u2019s presidential elections.\u201d In addition, Ebadi has called the Iranian elections \u201chistoric.\u201d\nThe new Iranian parliamentarians may, at least in the short term, play some role in blocking out US interests and demands \u2013 while they are trying to negotiate a peaceful end to Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 but the Supreme

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday amid reports the United States is planning to formally recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , a source familiar with the call","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday amid reports the United States is planning to formally recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a source familiar with the call said.\nUS media reports in recent days have claimed Trump is considering lifting last month\u2019s freeze on the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, in one of his final acts as president \u2013 although the US embassy in Jerusalem has yet to comment on the reports.\nAccording to the Palestinian president, Trump indicated \u201cthat he is considering doing this and that we have agreed to this.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to inform you that the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinians would like to know if you are not going to give the status of \u2018state\u2019 to the Palestinian homeland in Jerusalem and in the West Bank,\u201d Abbas told Trump, according to a Palestinian presidential statement.\n\u201cThe Palestinian leadership agrees with the view that Jerusalem constitutes the capital of Palestine until the establishment of the homeland,\u201d the statement reads.\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham did not confirm or deny the comments but claimed the White House had \u201clong held\u201d the view that Jerusalem must be considered the \u201cone and only\u201d capital of Israel.\nTrump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a move that is also widely viewed by Palestinians as hostile and illegal according to international law, has the risk of triggering a full-blown confrontation with the Palestinians.\nJerusalem has been under Israeli occupation; and Israeli military operations in the area began in 1967, when the Palestinian territories were captured by Israel as part of a deal reached three decades ago.\nJerusalem is located in the West Bank and according to international law belongs to the Palestinian territories. But Israel considers Jerusalem a \u201cspecial city,\u201d which should be under its sovereignty. Palestinians say that this has led to violent actions, including the establishment of illegal Jewish settlement, which Israel does not recognize and that has seen violence in recent years.\nNetanyahu on Friday refused to rule out the possibility that the American administration may move in that direction.\n\u201cThe American administration certainly has made it known that its views matter. I can guarantee you this: Jerusalem does not need a status,\u201d he said amid the flurry of media reports that followed a call Trump made with Abbas and other leaders in the region, The Times of Israel reported.\nAccording to Trump\u2019s press secretary, Trump\u2019s intention was to make it clear to the Palestinians that they can only reach a final peace settlement by accepting the status quo of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2013 meaning a final and permanent status to the city will be decided by another country. Israel itself will have the final say.\nTrump and most leaders in the region are not willing to accept Israel\u2019s position \u2013 they want Jerusalem to be the capital of the country, and they have also been trying to move it in recent years.","token_len":610,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,5.3036,1.5858,5.1207,0.7476,0.0087,0.0003,1.9192,2.1075,6.2498,3.7521,3.1006,2.7484,0.0738,1.5575,3.3669,0.3287,5.884,2.901,1.133,0.0954,0.2679,0.0484,0.0685,0.1262,2.2678,2.1698,6.1036,1.6635,0.0033,0.1604,6.7403,0.8103,0.1904,0.1516,21.6882,6.7027,1.2714,4.632,1.4303,0.472,0.8601,3.7155,3.4252,2.1385,1.9072,4.4511,8.2019,1.9952,18.1453,7.9794,5.8955,5.6965,0.0344,2.4698,3.4197,0.0518,4.424,0.1697,0.69,0.1477,0.1125,0.0008,1.5093,3.5016,6.9606,0.2474,2.8123,4.1138,2.7499,1.7367,0.3906,6.4829,4.2881,1.5617,2.5547,5.2618,0.5429,1.6265,1.4284,3.0821,0.0035,2.6211,0.4482,0.9376,2.1968,0.1338,0.1651,5.9833,0.004,1.0827,3.5721,6.0226,0.5753,2.1066,6.2177,13.266,5.741,1.8063,0.7637,2.4547,1.6952,4.9342,3.5384,4.5679,1.5308,4.5166,3.3457,4.6133,0.8499,4.6465,3.1132,3.5967,7.8987,0.8457,4.7631,1.1034,4.9304,3.1393,0.9371,0.1063,4.9499,0.6004,0.392,1.9342,6.5016,0.8817,0.5467,2.5548,0.7253,4.3622,4.7989,0.4999,0.2101,4.6549,2.3187,3.1482,1.4283,5.2129,3.1808,0.0408,4.8728,2.8325,3.4798,0.2127,9.1873,6.5308,3.9025,2.5873,2.1637,0.6759,1.1721,2.5479,9.5346,2.9146,4.7128,2.684,3.1634,0.8526,0.9416,0.001,1.8797,3.6504,3.1508,8.3021,1.2067,3.5445,2.6425,1.2401,0.0049,1.6427,1.8885,7.829,2.9348,0.6977,0.3878,1.5218,0.9177,2.4967,1.7759,3.0015,5.7019,1.5507,1.5917,4.7484,0.5622,3.2653,7.4488,0.9863,0.3524,0.0962,2.5982,7.3369,1.1014,2.6929,0.0193,1.9835,6.5637,2.5178,0.7293,1.1569,1.7605,0.7809,3.9063,0.1383,0.2432,3.2823,1.3838,1.6456,1.6616,5.7661,0.0013,1.0961,9.3611,2.3032,0.0449,0.0004,5.008,0.0076,2.9769,1.5642,0.0054,0.6363,4.4031,2.7889,4.6661,1.5613,2.9533,0.0015,2.4535,11.7276,1.588,6.4326,4.2506,3.7184,3.0639,1.9265,0.7386,0.0831,2.6425,5.0033,0.6487,3.7722,1.5704,8.0908,5.3333,6.7095,1.4622,0.0113,2.1786,3.2094,0.2244,0.1488,2.561,0.8872,0.1857,3.1825,5.4855,3.593,1.2444,6.8133,0.2349,0.2841,0.5816,2.7611,3.5103,0.7126,1.0196,0.0402,2.6803,3.6934,1.418,0.7309,2.949,3.8362,4.3902,3.1223,2.7517,1.3989,0.9052,7.9907,2.6575,3.8482,8.2085,0.0073,3.391,0.4952,0.1326,2.1186,5.1031,7.8259,0.0616,2.9817,1.0561,4.1583,0.344,1.3916,4.0998,1.2126,1.5911,1.6927,1.3227,0.3419,6.4975,0.0012,2.4475,1.0392,2.3894,1.0982,1.3792,10.2134,4.6243,4.5587,3.3371,3.0622,1.2672,0.5032,2.4786,5.3761,0.5846,0.9387,1.2541,1.0143,1.2402,2.7826,3.7492,0.5111,4.7531,0.6208,0.4273,4.1142,0.2591,0.0008,1.1315,4.3318,3.1823,7.8747,1.0963,0.3896,1.0658,0.5735,4.9565,0.0008,1.3088,4.283,1.548,0.3625,0.6213,0.0028,1.2453,8.4163,0.0039,4.0622,0.0735,6.2179,0.0836,0.4843,1.3252,1.7009,0.9567,4.6863,2.9902,4.1376,1.8102,2.0354,9.518,1.2512,8.3994,6.0178,5.4175,0.2008,1.4786,2.3498,5.6304,1.3034,6.291,2.8976,2.9543,0.9914,4.6526,2.9905,1.2647,3.6217,3.8185,1.1735,0.0717,4.8302,6.1196,2.8924,1.0076,1.9796,6.4668,0.0521,3.7434,5.4993,3.7695,3.8276,2.097,3.7758,5.5865,0.1554,0.7915,2.5,4.3163,2.3852,5.3335,3.6376,1.9235,1.6745,0.605,0.242,0.2336,7.6767,0.0013,5.5688,4.5319,5.2705,0.0647,3.4004,0.0296,1.6569,0.2172,1.468,1.3007,5.8905,2.0028,1.9445,3.2533,3.8988,3.3023,0.0128,0.9584,0.3483,2.402,0.7527,2.0581,2.6005,1.1825,6.8202,1.6173,4.7428,2.1697,4.3259,0.7722,4.1166,4.6489,7.7101,2.7395,3.3642,4.4057,3.9014,0.4115,4.0977,2.165,6.2481,4.6713,0.2762,4.0929,2.5767,2.9202,4.6295,0.1897,1.4481,3.2185,0.488,9.2151,2.1812,5.2397,0.0336,2.9508,0.4189,2.6256,4.1589,2.854,2.8195,8.6672,0.7551,2.4191,0.9508,3.3811,1.9793,2.2678,2.0417,1.1966,2.4777,3.0161,6.5651,3.5393,0.0107,0.0062,0.1953,0.4648,0.207,4.9558,0.0046,5.5746,2.0222,0.1682,0.0273,4.1818,0.413,0.3272,4.2845,2.5039,0.265,0.0164,4.5116,1.4198,0.3197,3.5338,2.0793,0.7186,2.1796,1.7191,1.0692,0.2945,2.1096,3.543,4.1798,5.7089,0.9746,3.0417,2.8598,3.6673,3.3878,3.9527,1.0877,1.9114,1.4687,2.5591,4.2255,0.704,1.1941,0.2547,0.1493,0.2558,4.245,5.6198,3.0448,3.549,5.0468,2.3387,2.1071,5.5278,0.8599,3.3418,9.1545,1.1088,3.1808,0.595,7.2515,3.8808,0.9423,7.3545,6.829,4.2009,2.3814,2.9298,1.6513,0.0324,2.1229,0.2099,3.0932,4.0525,7.9747,4.9462,0.7771,0.329,0.2413,2.2611,3.1708,3.8841,0.0321,2.4382,5.1809,2.4437,0.1803,0.0773,4.077,4.2093,3.3388,2.2898,6.0312,0.7402,0.941,1.8795,0.5385,0.071,1.6445,4.5402,2.114,2.0878,1.9651,2.5977,4.658,2.8722,4.1576,0.1644,4.2787,2.5917,2.699,2.301,0.8826,0.704]}

(AP: Mark Schiefelbein)\nChina, which has tried to strengthen ties with Australia, says reports it sought to interfere in Australia's 2018 election were taken very seriously.\nBut Beijing's top diplomat Wang Wenbin made no apology to Australia \u2014 a major power in Asia-Pacific.\n\"China stands firm on the position that China has no reason to seek to intervene in any of the election processes of other countries,\" he told reporters in Beijing.\n\"Any such intervention would cause serious harm to Australia at this crucial time, which would jeopardise the normal operation of the international system and the multilateral system, jeopardise the country's international interests and reputation, and affect the development of regional cooperation,\" he said.\nMr Wang criticised the Australian Prime Minister's comments that China sought to interfere in the elections.\nMr Turnbull said reports of election interference came from the US and Australia's Democratic leaders in the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 he did not mention his own party leaders.\n\"The Prime Minister made very clear what he saw as evidence of election interference, but this is not the evidence we've seen,\" Mr Wang told reporters.\n\"If my judgement is correct, the Prime Minister s comment was that there was no evidence of election interference.\"\nBut he did not say the comments were untrue and continued to downplay Australia's claims that China had sought to meddle in the election.\n\"In view of the complexity of the issue and given all the evidence, he was right to make a statement based on the evidence provided to him,\" Mr Wang said.\nMr Wang also said Mr Turnbull's remark was not consistent with China's position.\n\"China has always respected the right of election of other countries and is committed to helping countries maintain stable and democratic political systems and democratic elections,\" he said.\n\"However, China does not believe and does not condone

Food and money are in","text":"Since Iraqi forces pushed the Kurds out of the Yazidis mountainous heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in October, residents are wondering what could happen to them next. Food and money are in short supply and many have not seen relatives and friends in months.\nThe most recent batch arrived on Thursday morning, and a dozen people are expected to arrive a day later. Meanwhile, some men have walked for up to km to get there. Those who want to get out of Sinjar now are facing an obstacle. They need to travel deep into the mountains over unknown mountain passes.\nBut these passes have been closed off with explosives for weeks, making any attempt to leave impossible. In this village a man stood with a rifle, pointed at the sun, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody left to leave. I don\u2019t wanna be caught in this trap, and I don\u2019t want others to be caught so we move in,\u201d he said.\nThat means they face their only chance at survival by going head-on into the enemy. It was an unquestionably brave move, but one many were ready for in the absence of any other alternative. At one point, the leader of the group shouted, \u201cThe Arabs are not going to enter. When they enter, you die. We will enter.\nWe have nothing. It\u2019s up to God to save us. We have only one request with us, and that is the protection of God.\u201d. We have many brothers among them, they are very smart.\nNow we are going back and forth, up and down, everywhere. The men we have with us are from other tribes but in Sinjar we were all Arabs. We asked Allah to protect us, to protect our wives, children and people.\nThe situation is getting worse in Sinjar. We don\u2019t know how much longer we will be able to stay in Sinjar. I was a bit scared after the Arabs entered.\nWe started from the mountain where we had our tents. We moved to another mountain, where they are bombing us. Then we moved to a larger mountain. The Arabs are pushing us into more and more mountains as they are bombing us, as is every day. Now we are not able to move because we need to be protected. But we need to push our families out. We cannot sit there for longer and wait for the war to end. After the Arabs entered, we decided we had nothing left to do here.

{"prompt":"Two human heads were discovered in a cooler outside an office of broadcaster Televisa in the Mexican city of Guadalajara , authorities said on Tuesday . It was not clear who the heads belonged to","text":"Two human heads were discovered in a cooler outside an office of broadcaster Televisa in the Mexican city of Guadalajara, authorities said on Tuesday. It was not clear who the heads belonged to or whether the bodies had been eaten by insects. The discovery came a day after a similar death and its discovery at the same building, but it was not known whether the bodies belonged to men or women. The head was cut from the right side with a tool and then put in a refrigerator, authorities said, without presenting any other details. Police in Guadalajara are waiting for the family of one of the deceased, who has not yet been identified, said Alejandro G\u00f3mez Camacho, spokesman for the Jalisco State Preventive Agency. The family was notified shortly after the discovery, he said. Mr Camacho did not say whether the human head was a dead body or part of one. In a television interview on Sunday, broadcaster Carmen Aristegui said she was the victim of a plot. Two men were arrested in a house in Guadalajara, Aristegui said on Monday night, and they were accused of killing her. She had denounced on her show for several years political corruption in Mexico\u2019s governing elite.\nAn army major and a major in his command were killed in the northeast province of Balkh on Tuesday, the official Khorramabad News Agency reported, but it was not clear what was going on. The major was killed in a roadside bomb attack and an artillery bombardment of the army office in Makhrour. He was in charge of training army personnel, the newspaper reported. The newspaper reported that a suicide bomber blew himself up near the military building. As a result, a number of soldiers were wounded in the incident.\nThe U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved a five-year budget that extends U.S. assistance for the training of Afghan forces. The measure was put through the Senate by Majority Leader John McCain. It passed unanimously with 58 votes. The Senate\u2019s approval of the package is the final step necessary for Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress to take it to a full vote in the House, although no date has been set. Opponents of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan have strongly criticized the Pentagon\u2019s plan to help train Afghans with weapons and equipment, which they say is going too far. Afghanistan\u2019s long-missing peace talks have continued despite the security concerns, but the government and Taliban officials have struggled to seal a deal. The Senate's vote, the final hurdle between Congress and the Pentagon for the controversial training plan, came as U.S. warplanes struck a suspected bomb-making facility. The move came after Washington said the Taliban was planning to launch an offensive against Afghan soldiers and civilians. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said that the target was a site known to be used by the Taliban for manufacturing illegal weapons. No casualties were reported.

{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Chuck Grassley , head of the Senate Judiciary Committee , proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government , a law that","text":"U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that Grassley says is vulnerable to abuse by disgruntled employees or even terrorist groups.\nAccording to law enforcement officials, such a bill could allow FBI agents to request information and evidence from U.S. citizens even decades after they started working for foreign governments or agencies.\n\"The FBI has told us that our disclosure rules must be changed to include foreign nationals working as contractors on projects for their national governments,\" Sen. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who has a lengthy background in law enforcement, said in the House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\"We want to protect the integrity of the FBI and also ensure national security for our country,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican member of the panel who has been involved in drafting the law.\nGrassley said the current system of disclosing information about U.S. citizens working in foreign nations was too lax.\nUnder current law, the Bureau of Investigation could disclose information about such employees only after 30 years if they have left their services to their former government, and for an indefinite period if they have remained in their foreign country of employment.\n\"Even a decade ago, we had an FBI employee who worked in Afghanistan and turned on the FBI,\" Grassley said. \"And so, I think we're going against the law by keeping that information from the intelligence community.\"\nIn his statement, Grassley, who has long been a staunch supporter of enhanced national security and intelligence cooperation, called on the Intelligence Community to \" make a statement to the general membership of Congress and the American people to the effect that no one working in the office of the Director of National Intelligence will be subject to the disclosure restrictions currently in place.\"\nSen. Richard Shelby, who chairs U.S. intelligence committees, has publicly suggested that he will resist U.S. Senate pressure for disclosing information on \" foreign national \" employees of the intelligence community if he is appointed head of that department under Secretary of Defense James Clapper.\nHe said Tuesday that the FBI is asking if it is legal for intelligence officers and law enforcement officials to release information about people who worked on behalf of their new government even if that information is collected after they left their previous government.\n\"I feel it's important that there is some transparency,\" Shelby told The Associated Press. \"The law is going to follow a certain formula that will protect people who were serving in our military or our intelligence community for years and we will have to find a way to allow that.\"\nSen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat on the Judiciary Committee who was the Democratic minority leader during the Bush administration, said he would \" support every policy that's in the interest of ensuring that foreign national workers in the intelligence community are protected and have the proper safeguards in place.\"\n\"I would make it absolutely clear that there are rules that govern the disclosure of information from these foreign national workers,\" he urged.","token_len":612,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,4.4287,0.6912,1.5373,5.4001,0.0021,0.0481,0.539,0.1635,0.0488,0.3125,7.7386,1.3659,1.362,2.1219,1.8103,1.4361,4.0049,8.9367,1.4694,5.9558,9.3091,4.7785,1.665,1.4664,0.0178,0.9105,0.4566,0.4114,1.975,3.7253,5.2439,0.7982,4.5137,2.7603,2.0972,7.0755,0.0445,1.9722,1.6896,8.4146,0.8938,3.7065,3.5807,6.6687,1.2243,0.2025,0.2581,19.6281,0.0038,6.265,0.7272,0.7262,0.531,4.724,1.9163,1.211,2.0094,3.973,5.5787,0.7635,0.2799,3.9969,1.7876,5.0735,5.7122,0.7445,3.9546,0.0006,0.0011,0.005,1.3456,5.663,10.4327,0.2087,0.798,5.1434,1.1184,0.8391,3.555,0.2832,2.7663,5.6573,0.6248,0.432,1.3604,2.2385,2.1179,2.0212,6.9605,0.9653,1.023,4.8987,5.8424,1.7521,4.597,0.5131,2.5181,1.5928,3.5529,4.0869,2.2931,1.9669,3.5078,3.7042,3.024,6.0659,3.2412,3.7424,4.0706,0.9511,0.6303,4.5154,0.001,1.2268,2.4317,4.5887,0.0926,0.0336,0.1717,4.8629,2.0453,3.773,5.8393,5.0448,0.2953,2.3054,0.0153,0.2951,0.737,0.2948,4.9473,3.5587,0.8581,0.0802,1.3302,0.5488,0.607,2.2025,2.222,3.731,0.3788,3.8498,1.5892,3.6958,0.1114,1.2782,1.8406,1.5626,4.8297,2.893,6.5937,0.0624,3.8756,0.9906,2.1581,0.7711,3.6782,1.6385,0.0009,2.9579,0.9803,0.0,0.181,2.4099,1.7987,3.9373,0.0826,0.06,4.5519,1.3219,2.2579,1.6174,4.7233,0.2244,3.8624,0.4666,2.4893,0.3597,0.4073,3.4915,0.0005,0.0002,1.677,1.3797,4.2446,1.7631,1.8765,3.1311,0.762,1.862,2.1958,0.0003,0.0013,0.016,0.4442,5.2627,2.2003,1.104,3.6531,2.9512,4.2078,1.9079,1.5867,0.5312,5.7349,1.4838,0.8976,0.0451,1.9243,4.2193,1.3647,4.3921,3.2591,3.336,0.6653,0.8214,5.947,2.8582,1.8171,2.4392,7.2407,3.9456,4.4076,1.5246,1.2626,4.7822,3.0578,6.3868,2.7791,2.803,3.4684,4.0707,1.5608,2.9435,4.5082,4.1347,2.8396,0.0878,1.4486,0.2544,1.2511,4.7133,1.0335,1.7235,3.9061,1.8454,4.9571,1.6517,0.7001,0.6442,2.0141,5.1631,4.0827,4.2932,2.6884,0.3903,2.2152,1.8736,3.1988,2.9235,3.4616,0.8017,2.3676,1.9694,3.7021,2.3325,6.7964,4.0763,1.2883,4.1022,3.6109,0.4387,0.1184,0.2802,0.373,3.0308,3.8578,2.0113,3.1523,0.9903,1.896,2.1608,1.2159,7.7947,0.9284,2.2093,3.2711,5.5182,1.7917,1.5155,2.3632,2.0313,5.5339,0.0584,1.2945,0.0691,3.3986,2.5265,3.3929,0.4799,0.2104,4.4474,0.9938,1.5097,3.5082,1.4416,1.5652,2.8644,1.6396,0.0014,7.1068,3.1845,0.0439,2.9363,3.9054,2.1983,0.8365,2.423,1.6749,1.39,5.4184,0.6081,0.2146,2.6412,10.1952,2.5547,4.345,2.2032,1.4105,5.9715,8.5452,1.5061,0.9594,1.7526,0.9952,0.9836,0.1565,3.442,5.2064,4.1736,0.0422,4.1886,1.9285,3.9482,1.6829,1.0944,7.7561,0.0977,0.6085,1.9434,0.1241,0.1215,0.0001,3.4473,0.8348,3.1976,0.0091,1.8532,4.7095,4.977,4.2306,0.7299,0.0842,0.8703,0.1303,4.7713,0.0169,2.8181,3.658,0.242,3.7832,2.2266,8.4782,0.0003,0.0021,0.0014,7.0987,0.5982,0.2595,3.5891,5.4083,4.6938,0.7445,2.8189,1.9809,7.5374,7.6283,0.0002,0.0031,0.0044,5.4962,4.0533,3.5993,7.2017,0.9291,2.3776,5.4048,8.2035,4.7174,2.0685,2.3865,4.4033,1.1842,2.8908,0.1546,3.6271,1.8034,1.5762,3.812,4.0636,0.0247,5.1678,3.0288,5.7771,7.2411,0.1699,1.9405,1.4674,1.9452,1.2867,0.3995,4.2262,1.5329,5.1619,0.4361,2.0393,2.1602,2.8965,5.2564,5.7338,1.9897,2.1382,4.6699,0.5961,4.5321,2.5349,3.1545,4.5218,0.0162,0.9845,0.4487,4.7846,0.7431,0.8612,4.0002,1.6888,2.0926,1.4424,0.5355,0.0064,4.2208,6.9921,0.8095,4.4646,1.874,2.9571,0.448,0.9149,6.2921,4.6559,1.6013,2.0535,0.6925,5.0386,1.1065,0.5626,0.228,0.9393,1.7964,5.6271,3.0545,0.6199,2.3825,0.9728,4.1612,1.1378,3.2102,2.3302,2.8922,1.3282,2.0694,2.6675,2.1897,0.0015,0.668,0.4782,2.9086,4.112,1.7831,5.25,0.0495,6.8189,3.4597,3.8172,6.1071,2.3779,3.3234,3.2941,3.7784,1.1694,3.12,4.7532,1.1106,2.4484,1.7519,2.2969,2.4933,1.2449,0.6339,2.4776,2.5243,1.8436,5.1791,2.6732,3.2816,0.9903,4.0281,1.6754,0.1098,0.1832,4.339,1.859,3.1338,0.2776,3.1611,0.0019,4.3134,0.0518,0.0,0.1066,1.6796,1.5343,0.1422,6.7535,0.1055,1.2889,0.0502,2.3779,3.3275,2.1808,6.0006,4.7821,0.2616,3.0035,0.2946,2.2053,0.158,0.1946,0.79,1.3641,2.0871,3.3729,8.289,5.787,6.6712,2.3758,4.0844,2.3084,0.8412,5.9423,0.0214,5.0624,0.8445,4.6686,3.3247,3.454,4.0082,1.0822,1.2211,0.0617,1.1317,2.0032,2.1847,3.5773,1.4179,4.4727,2.7213,1.8406,0.0243,0.5661,0.142,2.0574,1.4211,2.7889,4.889,1.4495,2.8025,0.1042,0.6916,3.0929,1.5218,3.9033,1.2952,3.9198,1.597,3.2822,0.1185,0.5424,3.7931,4.7231,1.8136,1.8458,2.0677,0.9466,0.7901,8.7773,0.4509]}
{"prompt":"Pakistani Taliban gunmen disguised in all-enveloping burqas stormed the campus of an agricultural college in Pakistan on Friday , killing at least nine people and wounding 35 , police and hospital officials said . Police","text":"Pakistani Taliban gunmen disguised in all-enveloping burqas stormed the campus of an agricultural college in Pakistan on Friday, killing at least nine people and wounding 35, police and hospital officials said. Police found at least eight of the victims shot and four others stabbed to death at the Qalach College of Agricultural Sciences in Sanghar, southeast of Islamabad, Pakistan's second largest city. At least 15 more were wounded, said a local police commander and a spokesperson for the college. \" The gunmen entered campus and attacked both students and professors,\" said Zahir Kahn, a police spokesperson from Sanghar. \" At least eight people were shot and four stabbed.\" Another officer said the gunmen had carried out attacks in the colleges of Shalimar and Khadgar, a city in the same region. A second college was also attacked at Bacha Khan in Sanghar, the police and a college official said. The attack was believed to have originated from within the campus itself, said the college spokesperson. He said it was similar in nature to the attacks carried out earlier in the week in the college and did not reveal the nature of the attacks. The college is primarily staffed with female teachers and students, and students were largely absent as they were staying with their parents for the weekend. The attack comes a day after another four individuals reportedly died and at least 21 were injured when gunmen attacked a college in Lahore, one of India's wealthiest cities. The attackers, dressed in burqas and wrapped in bandannas, broke into a faculty apartment complex at the Pakistan Institute of Management Studies in Lahore, Pakistan's finance capital. The gunmen then shot at students, faculty and staff who ran for cover, Pakistani officials said on Friday. At least 11 were dead and at least 21 injured when gunmen attacked the Pakistan Institute of Management Studies, one of India's wealthiest cities. A local official said at least six were decapitated before the attackers fled with students in tow. The government has accused Pakistan's militant groups and their local allies of masterminding a spate of similar assaults on schools and colleges. At least 45 people were killed in a suicide car bomb that exploded at a high-security campus of Pakistan's military academy in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province. The attack also left dozens of others injured, the local authorities said. The explosion came amid a spike in violence in the nation's southern provinces, which have seen attacks aimed at militants, security personnel and civilians alike. The spate also includes a wave of school and college attacks that have left scores dead and wounded. On June 12, a suicide bomber attacked a school in Lahore, causing at least 40 injuries. Days later, another suicide bomber attacked a military academy, killing at least 34 people and wounding dozens. The Pakistan Institute of Management Studies, one of India's top-business colleges, has also been targeted by insurgents in the past. In February, two Islamists armed with knives entered the campus and assassinated nine people, including four university professors and a security guard.

{"prompt":"British and European Union Brexit negotiators have reached agreement on a deal for all Irish issues , including the maintenance of regulatory alignment on the island to avoid a hard border , two Irish government","text":"British and European Union Brexit negotiators have reached agreement on a deal for all Irish issues, including the maintenance of regulatory alignment on the island to avoid a hard border, two Irish government sources and a British official said as EU leaders gather this weekend to decide whether to accept a hard Brexit. The news could put a stamp of approval on a deal that will need to be approved by Parliament in both London and Brussels. It is believed that on Sunday, at the last possible moment, EU leaders will seek to agree to a deal through a procedure known as \u2018fast-track\u2019 which would allow the British to leave the EU on 29 March without a lengthy transitional period and would mean that a No Deal Brexit would not be prevented. Ministers have also agreed to a solution for the Irish border that would ensure a customs border is not created at 3 kilometers between Ireland of Northern Ireland. \u201cIt remains the view of the Republic that no agreement be struck with the European Council if there is the likelihood that a No Deal Brexit will result and that it, along with Northern Ireland, is still bound, whatever happens, to the customs union and single market rules,\u201d the Irish government said in a written statement after a meeting with European officials. \u201cWith regard to a hard border, a customs border will be the preferred outcome in the future and there is still a need for a pragmatic solution to be found to the Irish Sea question,\u201d it said.\nBritish and European Union Brexit negotiators were due to continue to discuss their draft agreement with EU officials in Brussels early in the evening but it was unclear how much time that would take. The final agreement is intended to give Britain a Brexit deal by 30 March, three months before the scheduled deadline to leave the bloc, which London officials insist is too little time. But a source in the Government Office who was not authorised to speak for it said the agreement still needs to be ratified by the UK Parliament. Sources suggested there was no agreement on a third Irish backstop, agreed by Downing Street but rejected by the EU as an attempt to prevent a hard border between Britain and the Republic. Some sources also suggested that a no-deal Brexit would not prevent Britain from remaining a part of the customs union and Single Market.\nBritain's Deputy Prime Minister and Brexit Minister David Davis has been in London for talks with EU negotiators despite plans to go to Brussels later in the week for talks with top EU officials. Mr Davis, who has been described as a key player in the Brexit process, said he was unable to leave Britain in such good company. He made his comments while visiting the Foreign Office with his counterparts Mr Michael Gove, Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary, and Mr Dominic Raab, senior Brexit official. He was told by officials last week that his trip to Brussels was being put on hold until later in the week for the appointment of new EU Brexit negotiators. When he arrives in Brussels on the morning of Tuesday, he will meet with EU Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Deputy Chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt.","token_len":613,"entropy":[3.8081,3.0702,3.1095,9.6023,3.2859,1.7238,4.7103,3.1814,0.4309,0.7453,2.064,2.7639,5.1851,6.6739,7.6678,1.3547,1.2419,1.5288,8.2576,0.0561,7.3507,6.8984,3.9944,1.3998,3.2376,6.0119,2.5144,1.5754,3.4706,0.6534,2.2796,6.769,3.3439,2.0239,0.4847,6.0531,1.4798,4.6862,2.6507,0.8093,7.2105,5.153,1.2338,6.0674,4.3594,2.5178,2.3533,4.5609,1.5881,0.2595,3.5528,1.4405,4.6723,0.6749,1.2768,3.4488,7.2149,4.2336,4.1612,2.243,7.1609,0.9007,0.3606,0.2018,1.9502,1.3055,1.0875,2.9577,5.9901,0.7495,0.2517,2.353,0.2379,4.1593,2.7585,4.6474,5.6998,0.0149,0.7475,0.8751,3.8912,1.5179,3.3624,0.9396,5.6651,2.6229,1.2966,4.4462,1.6159,2.9968,4.1712,0.2003,0.2228,3.9071,0.6145,0.5351,5.2758,0.7263,2.2847,3.5088,0.9136,1.8155,5.6139,1.2825,5.3507,1.5413,0.0162,13.0766,6.3844,5.9401,1.0722,0.0261,1.6102,8.394,3.7203,1.1848,1.3772,1.3836,4.2515,1.2691,2.6146,0.1695,0.8058,3.1432,5.9567,1.6554,3.8019,2.9847,6.5768,4.6133,0.0456,3.0981,3.8735,4.3208,1.0011,3.1475,8.1996,6.9219,3.5299,1.5095,1.6858,0.9889,8.2806,0.7784,5.8464,2.1258,2.506,1.9042,0.5977,2.7777,6.8004,1.3557,1.205,1.8987,0.9474,3.5015,0.8535,3.7822,2.5794,5.2512,2.9768,3.5464,2.6758,3.8305,3.0825,10.0044,11.3505,3.2068,2.3448,9.5731,3.5188,0.0108,6.4102,8.3513,6.2469,5.7077,3.5302,4.7899,2.9337,0.3481,1.0653,6.4499,1.745,4.323,3.1649,7.7666,4.4357,2.698,0.7097,2.8232,2.9992,4.3629,2.4002,0.2147,5.2032,5.8031,0.7881,2.1616,3.2867,0.0959,0.1495,1.2845,3.1736,5.1188,1.0164,2.9965,6.6493,3.3146,0.0064,5.559,0.0349,0.4741,2.3563,5.0839,5.987,6.2507,6.8737,4.0701,1.2833,0.4851,1.4142,4.0018,0.9305,2.8574,6.9357,0.008,5.5363,2.6166,9.2539,6.5097,3.0148,3.2016,0.8533,2.8825,2.0821,0.3732,5.1023,0.064,5.1166,3.0617,0.3975,0.6885,3.0087,3.3785,1.1691,3.49,0.5762,4.8672,1.735,0.0088,3.7404,3.9109,0.9368,0.4466,3.1884,4.6422,1.468,3.037,0.9218,3.5806,4.9127,3.192,2.9546,1.4435,3.6145,2.3558,2.906,1.1532,4.1905,1.2653,3.016,0.5352,1.0582,6.4273,1.6275,1.6369,4.5423,1.5707,2.8578,2.029,2.8054,10.0974,5.5143,1.5709,1.9375,1.1714,3.5779,0.9543,0.1493,1.8176,13.6986,2.1673,0.8783,1.2976,3.3289,0.0783,5.8387,2.5771,0.047,7.0998,2.2593,1.4705,3.1258,6.5625,2.5271,2.9895,2.7936,2.3625,2.0917,0.3888,6.3122,3.8609,0.1594,2.8607,3.5971,3.2009,1.2923,2.0422,2.3904,1.9689,0.924,5.1853,1.1914,1.3497,0.7261,1.7863,4.1364,1.9998,2.345,6.1678,0.0774,4.3386,3.1441,1.5047,6.3859,1.5474,2.5949,4.5382,0.5936,1.5987,5.4646,1.3299,1.4816,0.6731,4.8672,1.4842,2.4275,1.4748,0.0732,2.6857,2.2721,2.938,7.0526,4.0494,5.0028,0.9669,2.8992,3.1484,6.4591,0.9342,4.0397,3.2381,2.8328,2.7106,1.1909,4.1525,4.0845,4.0106,1.8371,1.0843,1.1386,0.0159,0.3714,4.9942,7.5608,0.5512,1.7172,4.1447,5.63,1.5698,0.313,0.0988,3.5569,0.2801,1.3662,2.7805,1.2359,1.3677,5.3157,6.0086,3.7285,1.1496,1.9765,4.0136,0.8673,1.6901,6.6161,4.9748,7.2425,2.0847,1.833,8.4082,0.9152,6.1198,0.002,3.168,2.7331,0.0885,1.2778,2.9746,3.5838,3.3512,3.5216,0.2677,4.1779,1.0493,0.3326,0.6563,2.9823,2.3906,0.0342,1.0697,0.9118,0.6609,5.2429,2.8915,3.4721,1.5154,0.7339,1.928,5.0526,1.7217,0.042,0.5879,1.1897,1.471,3.6438,2.7391,0.4449,3.3979,2.2316,2.6252,0.0047,0.0479,3.3126,0.0078,1.6004,5.3641,0.0165,1.6767,1.3769,3.9714,1.4405,4.8467,0.2247,0.0063,5.0749,2.9776,2.8651,1.7229,0.0111,2.5198,2.3949,2.1309,3.5397,1.9359,1.1946,0.4792,1.2754,3.6405,7.0757,7.624,0.6375,3.7893,0.9166,1.1785,3.7203,2.0621,0.0456,1.7695,2.5535,1.1305,0.9415,6.1272,1.2718,0.4357,0.5622,4.0865,0.0957,2.2854,0.7325,1.7483,0.9655,5.743,0.5509,1.0086,5.0287,1.9674,0.1232,0.9562,2.1332,2.7557,0.395,3.0766,1.7586,1.3008,6.2009,0.0324,5.6792,4.1415,3.0322,6.1633,7.7578,5.3754,1.1983,2.0022,4.7933,2.3794,1.319,3.6786,2.5731,1.2599,5.3287,0.3672,4.3309,2.7976,3.9787,7.3114,6.0619,0.2318,0.001,0.917,7.183,18.4043,7.2523,1.3242,3.5416,0.0981,0.4983,2.2976,1.921,6.9964,0.9027,0.0024,0.6634,6.2232,2.0365,2.5,0.5915,2.6006,2.6926,4.2937,1.7689,3.6375,6.9348,0.6651,0.1526,3.4213,3.4077,1.2344,0.3637,1.082,3.2555,4.9191,0.5398,0.0551,2.8678,4.6892,1.1169,0.0819,0.1395,4.4636,2.3999,9.1651,0.0363,3.3805,2.3155,5.9898,3.5616,0.3498,6.0405,2.7309,5.9261,0.6796,0.2858,1.3764,4.925,3.0775,0.0687,3.9364,0.4163,1.1426,0.3162,1.0206,1.2357,1.6238,5.597,1.7944,0.0922,0.117,0.0,0.0,1.1272,4.1125,3.404,0.5578,0.1956,3.6281,0.0071,0.0,0.0,0.9098]}

John McCain (R-Ariz.), said.\nSenators and their staff may not engage in any form of sexual contact outside of their normal work.\nAt a news conference at the Capitol, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the amendment the bipartisan group reached \"will set a national standard\" for sexual harassment. \"I think that this is an important amendment that really gives us bipartisan support,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.\nIn the House, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler pushed for an amendment to Congress' own version of the Bill, to include a provision that would make it easier for lawmakers to hire a lawyer to resolve the sexual harassment complaints.\n\"This is simply about giving women a chance to go to court to protect themselves and their legal rights,\" he said.\nThe House Judiciary Committee adopted six bills this year addressing sexual harassment and assaults.\nRepublicans opposed the legislation earlier Thursday, saying it does not go far enough. The bill requires lawmakers to provide a safe haven for female victims and requires them to pay for legal services from a third party.\nA new study by the Council on Foreign Relations argues that the growing popularity of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was not due to a fundamental change in U.S. foreign policy, but rather the media has oversold Trump's policy positions.\nThe study suggests that the media's portrayal of Trump as an isolationist and a supporter of strong military force and the United Nations have led the public to be afraid of a Trump presidency.\nThe American

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump is expected to rescind an Obama administration policy that protects from deportation nearly 800,000 immigrants who as children entered the country illegally , setting the stage for a fight with U.S. business","text":"President Donald Trump is expected to rescind an Obama administration policy that protects from deportation nearly 800,000 immigrants who as children entered the country illegally, setting the stage for a fight with U.S. business and immigrant advocates. The change on Thursday, the president's first action in office, was prompted by a new report from the nonpartisan Immigration Policy Center and the nonpartisan Institute for Policy Studies, which said U.S. courts had declined to issue roughly 7 percent of DACA permits since 2015, despite a national backlash against the program. The group's policy review included information from the National Congress of State Legislatures, the group Immigration Equality and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"They've just not been issued or they haven't been allowed to stay in the United States,\" U.S. Chamber President and CEO David S. Dodge said Tuesday. \"The way we were trained, we have a legal obligation to be helpful in providing this protection for these individuals.\" Trump's action Friday brings into question how long it will take to have DACA recipients deported, and possibly for them to move to other countries in case of emergencies. Many have been in USCIS custody over several months when they were found to be ineligible because of fraud and other violations. On Thursday, Trump said, \"For years now, these people were being put into limbo. The Obama administration put this in limbo for years now. And now we are going to be moving people to get them out of limbo.\" In a letter sent to members of Congress, Trump will ask whether Congress can override his decision to begin rescinding the policy. \" Congress has a strong obligation to take swift and decisive action to pass the necessary legislation to protect the DACA recipients and hold all of the government officials responsible,\" the letter, titled Protecting Dreamers, said. \"We urge you to begin the process. This will require swift action on your part, and we can support you as you move forward.\" \"I can see a fight ahead with big lobbyists and the like, but we have the ability to solve this,\" Trump said. But his choice of wording is likely to draw criticism from Democrats, who in 2018 were among the first to question Trump's use of the program when it was first announced. In that month, the New York Times published a report on the program, saying that DACA recipients were at great risk of being deported because of the \"chaotic\" structure of the program, including legal and political uncertainty. Trump then made clear he did not agree with the Times' analysis and called the DACA recipients \" dreamers.\" On Thursday, he cited \"a lot of misinformation,\" saying, \"Everybody that was in the program has to be protected.\" Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has been the agency in charge of DACA, which was initiated by President Obama in 2012 and can be expanded to cover another 1.3 million people in 2017. ICE is also responsible for deporting illegal immigrants. Trump said he would direct Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to terminate DACA and end its protections within 30 days.","token_len":614,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1658,3.7686,0.043,6.8266,3.436,2.4471,1.6722,1.2531,0.8151,4.8992,5.8944,1.6234,5.2552,2.6371,0.0508,0.001,2.1915,0.9525,9.3542,2.1665,3.7616,0.0487,1.0919,0.4943,2.1147,5.9357,1.9648,0.1133,0.0193,1.3461,5.7238,3.0755,5.6186,0.0004,0.0015,0.0046,8.1444,2.2442,4.3293,2.458,1.2956,3.0907,5.2515,5.8649,2.1699,2.6795,3.1328,3.0511,0.6612,0.6755,2.1102,2.7226,3.0808,0.7245,2.7206,4.7501,0.1289,1.4048,4.1908,2.7906,1.6279,0.4948,2.7037,4.3628,0.6043,1.1672,3.8194,1.6789,3.2655,4.3219,0.525,2.2822,0.0491,2.1038,0.2565,2.4221,5.3087,0.0002,0.0017,0.0033,5.9432,1.9674,4.7558,0.0651,5.0158,10.2369,3.7217,4.025,0.1446,4.5283,4.8848,3.4052,3.8956,1.7299,3.437,2.4071,6.0173,5.1265,1.0819,0.6651,1.7265,0.3508,2.1059,4.3822,2.3731,6.4324,3.3968,5.4492,5.1728,1.3414,1.8556,3.938,7.5363,0.006,4.0068,0.0174,0.0275,0.779,1.2188,5.8646,11.5074,5.1903,2.4437,3.2133,5.0079,0.004,0.005,0.0093,1.0961,0.0095,0.0001,0.8132,2.9476,5.0606,2.723,4.3846,3.8207,1.8229,6.0393,4.8936,4.4352,1.6618,0.0003,0.5939,5.2653,0.1661,2.8148,1.2734,0.2601,1.2962,0.0007,0.8714,5.6631,0.0089,0.0022,0.001,3.2688,1.2489,2.3851,0.0531,3.7859,4.5988,1.5758,9.2102,0.5351,4.8884,0.621,0.6139,2.6383,5.4193,2.2866,5.0276,7.704,1.9744,1.0452,3.9513,2.6875,3.1624,2.1442,0.2308,3.9451,6.7983,2.1227,4.3483,4.1906,2.8907,2.4438,2.3438,3.3133,0.7645,3.4801,1.2116,2.2366,5.4786,6.3122,4.6439,1.6981,3.8252,3.1367,2.6893,0.3688,0.4361,1.4895,5.6112,1.8273,3.2637,3.9335,1.3916,1.9235,6.673,3.7165,4.0275,0.0586,4.2761,1.2738,1.5777,0.6621,3.7296,4.7107,1.3147,5.4653,0.3984,4.5766,3.3614,2.0431,2.8194,10.8739,0.1682,1.819,5.7036,5.1573,0.6716,6.398,0.8082,1.443,4.4426,1.0942,0.977,4.9443,3.3214,0.9452,5.4505,2.2179,2.4413,2.1447,1.3606,4.9253,1.545,0.103,2.2075,2.2379,3.9033,0.2332,5.9802,3.0877,2.5388,0.2881,5.3881,1.1944,2.5918,2.9218,3.8872,2.075,3.2425,2.1288,3.6059,4.7091,0.3668,4.4658,3.783,1.921,6.0883,2.5854,1.5588,5.789,1.2601,2.5074,1.3322,2.2037,2.362,1.5313,0.0626,2.8082,4.5606,4.1044,2.2253,6.6223,1.9498,1.7136,0.7463,3.0926,0.8795,3.7317,1.8337,2.6503,2.4319,0.275,4.3391,0.0367,0.14,0.8454,2.7623,8.6189,2.5496,4.923,1.9566,1.9052,5.3432,2.538,1.7436,1.2597,6.2013,3.6758,0.0015,1.1958,2.0604,0.8121,1.396,11.4074,1.7561,2.5329,5.0116,2.0443,0.2008,3.3146,3.8433,1.6438,0.8058,0.0702,0.354,6.548,3.2204,4.3384,0.8433,0.7771,1.6558,1.6225,2.7517,1.2832,1.9929,5.497,4.5205,2.2909,1.4432,4.1568,3.2471,1.1435,2.3889,0.8547,0.2808,4.326,3.8132,5.4515,0.1789,2.0335,0.0286,0.6708,1.1905,0.1333,0.7754,2.3828,2.1137,0.7412,0.1174,5.2577,2.5384,0.3375,5.3873,3.1135,2.6335,3.0562,3.8351,0.7373,2.9339,4.2791,0.0261,1.6075,1.0465,1.4989,4.653,6.4617,0.5092,3.3528,0.6391,2.6713,0.1952,0.8876,4.5561,2.7617,3.9081,3.8601,3.0917,5.8536,4.0621,4.4504,7.2741,9.071,1.5259,3.2334,4.8994,1.7839,1.332,2.1674,1.6673,4.0205,3.5081,0.2666,6.2016,0.6358,2.5034,2.3481,0.4732,0.8844,4.6175,3.6838,6.5934,1.0014,9.392,2.5183,2.0369,0.1176,3.6588,1.5015,0.3427,3.7434,1.0994,0.296,5.6548,7.6079,4.6181,4.0329,0.5623,1.0475,1.0301,5.1896,2.2315,0.0754,5.2896,0.0027,0.7145,6.13,5.3226,2.6811,0.7175,1.0391,1.1855,0.5565,3.4291,4.7774,6.088,0.2574,2.097,4.7478,0.0714,0.3121,2.9416,0.8099,1.8006,2.7265,1.2664,1.8562,1.0639,2.721,1.1234,3.6904,0.3464,1.6535,3.5511,4.7549,0.0101,0.3719,1.4098,0.7114,2.2856,0.7688,2.9908,2.6803,9.6219,0.0054,1.7801,6.4021,0.3413,0.3547,0.5156,1.4948,3.1182,5.2099,2.5197,3.2524,3.9003,0.7206,2.8376,6.1998,3.782,3.3238,1.6656,3.5212,0.02,4.9989,0.1686,0.6676,1.2197,1.8743,2.3482,2.1658,3.3195,1.1542,6.9529,2.4712,0.5682,13.7025,0.2052,2.4341,3.6856,1.5009,0.1049,2.3567,5.3571,3.7795,2.927,1.9206,0.0983,5.4866,2.2983,1.8631,2.0486,0.0295,5.9215,4.4573,3.6255,2.8994,1.0198,3.8731,3.4697,3.5446,1.3635,4.871,1.1987,5.5173,1.8334,0.0223,0.0005,2.4447,4.8646,0.0016,0.0186,2.0535,1.9358,3.0207,2.4831,3.9096,0.1918,0.0464,2.9718,2.4246,1.2863,2.2446,6.1282,1.5705,0.5335,1.2154,0.8529,1.7628,2.0451,6.5663,1.4749,4.1465,1.3413,2.2181,6.4331,3.138,0.5563,1.9368,0.0126,1.0681,3.0853,3.9463,0.1831,3.588,2.6685,1.9738,2.1081,0.0034,5.3968,0.0016,3.2455,0.1843,3.3322,2.4311,2.3694,1.7952,1.1377,6.5653,6.7855,0.6189,0.0951,0.0015,6.2911,0.1302,0.0023,0.4668,7.7603,1.3025,2.2271,4.142,2.6175,3.1254,4.7597,2.5743,0.0135,0.8042]}

The deal makes Tesla the world\u2019s largest maker of lithium-ion battery systems for electric cars.\nTesla Motors Inc last Friday said the cost of its second-quarter production charge would drop, due to the cost of battery supplies, while its margin was lower, the latest of a series of steps that the electric carmaker is taking in an attempt to keep its losses on a downward trend.","token_len":614,"entropy":[3.6033,0.4439,2.083,1.4637,5.7539,2.8665,1.8756,0.9927,3.0319,6.8277,6.5441,2.7149,0.9023,1.1456,8.7623,3.8323,3.474,2.025,1.9342,4.4798,0.0049,2.5697,0.8397,0.6736,2.9776,1.4146,0.5581,6.3,1.1266,5.5245,0.7969,2.7748,6.413,1.3655,2.5279,4.8356,0.0079,3.0142,0.9126,4.7749,4.7056,4.0015,0.2444,17.9128,8.5306,7.4148,0.3158,1.6133,3.9486,7.9586,6.1797,1.2957,7.6592,0.4658,8.3879,0.127,6.059,1.7444,3.0848,4.7408,0.0216,0.0056,6.9699,0.9097,6.3176,2.0858,1.9556,4.2735,0.9861,0.1964,3.0434,4.6851,6.1443,0.8002,1.6295,0.6335,2.9979,4.8208,4.027,12.0856,0.214,3.2991,7.206,3.8304,0.5402,1.4795,1.5208,6.8048,0.088,0.0035,0.5805,3.9172,6.8358,8.1799,3.3636,4.5026,8.0444,0.5108,2.996,1.6108,3.9897,0.358,0.7542,0.7391,1.6674,7.4866,0.1895,3.6557,2.1031,1.5791,0.263,1.4801,4.3348,0.0269,5.1604,1.073,0.0464,2.77,3.491,5.5429,1.1074,1.1326,3.1647,2.5372,1.2381,0.1273,0.0006,0.6555,0.5861,2.1696,2.4391,2.4249,5.0359,0.0003,0.0018,3.5547,0.4575,4.1095,0.0041,0.002,1.3639,3.5931,3.6259,0.545,3.3365,3.6629,3.9065,1.766,1.1357,0.2324,9.7676,7.0227,1.6084,3.7747,5.1175,0.65,9.3697,3.1386,1.3993,3.201,0.8456,1.0925,2.9137,4.4671,2.9106,0.0009,2.955,2.2441,1.6457,0.4807,4.8086,7.4473,1.9415,0.8845,2.5275,0.3223,5.4606,5.1978,1.8305,1.4998,1.1521,4.2299,0.0356,1.0858,0.3139,0.0196,0.1157,0.2891,0.0332,0.2927,0.1696,1.8111,0.2918,3.4505,4.4223,7.4728,5.8042,9.4047,0.022,2.9759,3.831,4.3539,7.1973,9.4493,1.2533,1.6035,3.6364,5.1395,3.3375,2.8107,1.8863,3.827,7.8503,2.6587,5.85,0.6859,0.0171,5.5129,0.4666,2.3661,2.1117,4.3216,4.2637,3.4579,5.7321,0.699,0.8803,1.7959,9.6665,5.6906,6.3554,0.2949,0.0114,1.9396,2.3341,1.6299,1.1237,0.7781,5.1685,0.0106,3.9161,9.4671,0.7149,0.0057,8.7256,6.6363,0.2381,3.7312,0.6613,5.4234,3.6654,5.5839,1.4802,7.9125,0.0066,0.4699,1.3223,4.0401,0.9586,1.3287,0.8052,1.5468,2.911,0.0132,7.4513,2.0785,1.8881,4.3624,0.2369,0.001,0.0,0.695,1.0726,6.243,3.2012,0.1686,2.3374,4.5666,0.0465,0.7727,1.8329,2.0329,6.7576,6.9485,4.2996,2.4441,0.885,2.8961,0.8298,0.6311,2.7296,2.9787,4.3628,1.4279,6.3086,2.1543,0.0048,3.0385,5.5953,2.5525,0.0773,0.0327,1.9897,2.2891,6.1642,0.2567,3.5326,5.0467,4.1366,0.3158,3.1571,8.3169,0.1613,5.1824,2.7279,1.7159,4.7269,4.7458,2.7,3.7574,3.3149,5.0568,1.2498,2.2364,5.6889,1.8369,0.0457,7.8392,2.5016,1.2081,6.2364,3.2419,3.1577,5.9273,7.4084,0.0029,3.5284,3.5408,0.5813,6.757,1.453,2.4635,1.9033,6.5453,4.1949,4.9869,11.3327,1.4285,12.1345,0.542,1.2014,1.0653,1.5088,7.7178,4.8444,5.8604,0.001,0.0001,1.6009,1.3306,2.5001,1.1501,0.0811,0.1162,0.7483,1.467,0.0862,0.1591,4.6331,1.6196,4.6081,1.609,0.906,0.0557,0.0138,1.3677,3.279,3.0388,3.3516,3.5362,1.4162,0.0022,4.1978,0.0246,0.0285,3.2643,4.3191,1.2401,4.6168,1.6361,2.8043,2.6558,3.2993,3.2432,2.1694,1.9534,0.2039,8.0049,0.4633,1.2069,0.2608,1.6226,2.0134,3.4163,2.2127,2.9919,8.0853,2.5793,1.1916,2.2306,1.2279,9.0055,0.4434,0.016,1.8995,3.0848,0.5138,7.2805,1.2677,3.5663,0.0373,0.024,6.3623,1.7611,3.6425,4.4002,5.0745,5.349,1.4364,5.2036,4.706,0.3475,0.0001,0.2366,3.0588,2.7959,2.7709,4.8212,5.3941,6.3735,1.6395,0.7374,1.3878,5.3149,4.5374,3.1978,0.9436,1.0415,1.5154,6.4043,0.4784,1.8928,5.0473,3.8491,3.2347,1.242,4.4591,6.151,3.7333,1.378,6.0279,2.0434,0.0097,8.7387,0.2142,1.3203,6.3485,8.5289,0.0735,0.0006,4.1124,6.7292,3.1557,5.4297,1.7346,3.7033,4.4376,0.0101,0.0193,6.2987,2.657,3.9052,5.9904,3.784,2.9485,3.87,2.6969,3.7506,8.039,2.0258,5.3765,2.0115,0.3264,1.1226,1.8153,7.0499,6.7043,5.5718,3.7249,1.7749,3.7582,3.1935,0.329,0.2312,1.5649,5.3195,2.0829,8.0208,0.18,4.546,0.0399,0.0527,0.9144,2.7698,3.8609,1.8421,10.6804,5.725,1.4937,2.7959,1.7751,0.8116,10.8798,0.0369,1.0094,6.5322,6.7675,6.8468,6.8139,5.1825,5.685,6.7247,0.7829,1.4401,0.8514,5.7553,2.1249,1.2841,2.3618,6.3667,0.0468,0.1459,1.079,3.4651,0.0645,4.7065,0.1479,0.0052,1.0869,1.3954,4.636,1.9459,1.4425,0.8697,1.0478,2.8905,2.0596,2.1788,6.4431,5.7043,2.5428,3.3831,6.931,0.1808,2.2523,5.1531,0.5817,1.4267,3.9863,9.0684,3.7133,2.9955,6.1754,4.0441,0.3357,2.2785,4.4746,0.2882,4.2038,6.1632,1.8717,4.4426,2.8466,5.1294,2.6891,3.9036,2.6112,4.296,5.4788,4.0282,3.8964,0.7525,0.0192,5.7149,2.1287,2.4495,3.7212,0.8813,0.3475,2.2074,0.7023,2.9718,2.7412,1.5752,0.0066,3.6304,1.7715,6.31,4.6526,4.3856,3.4919,1.143,0.1879]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration has reversed an Obama administration stance and will support Ohio in its bid at the U.S. Supreme Court to revive a state policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do","text":"The Trump administration has reversed an Obama administration stance and will support Ohio in its bid at the U.S. Supreme Court to revive a state policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not complete a citizenship test.\nThe administration has signed the lawsuit filed by Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, to reinstate the policy, which allows the registration board to erase a person\u2019s name from the state\u2019s voter rolls \u201cwhen determined to be a lawbreaker without legal remedy,\u201d the White House said Friday.\nOhio\u2019s law was enacted in 2014, but was challenged by the Obama administration because it limited the legal remedy available to people who thought they had violated federal law. Although most states can allow people to register to vote without a citizenship test, voters can be denied this opportunity if they have been convicted of crimes such as fraud, robbery or felonies involving weapons. Trump signed an executive order a month ago allowing citizens of five countries \u2013 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria \u2013 to register with certain limitations based on whether they have been convicted of these crimes.\nTrump also signed orders earlier this year to provide citizenship to some Syrian refugees and to lift restrictions on immigration from Haiti and El Salvador, although the White House has not decided if these orders would apply to the new Trump administration or would be overturned by a future president.\nA federal judge in Philadelphia issued a ruling that states the White House can refuse to comply with a Supreme Court order, and it was unclear if the administration would try to uphold the court\u2019s ruling. The White House could still file an appeal to a federal district court in Cleveland to have the court review the matter.\nTrump\u2019s support for this policy is considered a move against the nation\u2019s immigrant community and has received mixed reactions from lawmakers and other political figures. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the administration\u2019s position represented an attack on the principles on which the nation was founded, while congressional leadership praised the White House for standing up to the president.\n\u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, it is no different for people of color \u2014 and especially immigrants \u2013 the burden of fear becomes a reality. Trump\u2019s policies make it clear this administration will use that fear to further white supremacy and other destructive trends that damage this country so long as these policies are allowed to remain,\u201d said Democratic Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez.\nA spokesman for the Trump administration said Friday that even if the administration does not file an appeal, it would

{"prompt":"Syrian rebels pinned down in a strategic area where the Israeli and Lebanese borders meet with Syria were handed an ultimatum by the Syrian army and its Iranian-backed militia allies to either surrender or face","text":"Syrian rebels pinned down in a strategic area where the Israeli and Lebanese borders meet with Syria were handed an ultimatum by the Syrian army and its Iranian-backed militia allies to either surrender or face \"certain destruction,\" the Israeli military said.\nThe Israeli Defence Forces posted a video of the rebels saying they would not surrender unless offered \"safe passage\" to leave Syria and the rebels' commander vowing to keep fighting.\n\"If they don't take this action, there will be certain destruction and certain death,\" the commander told the rebel militants in a video posted to the Syrian army's official news agency.\nThe ultimatum, made public on Sunday, has renewed fears the Damascus- and Tehran-backed rebels may be running out of options that would help them continue their fight against the government. Tension between the government forces and the rebels has been on the rise since late last year due to the ongoing conflict and rising military spending on weapons and other military equipment.\nSyria\u2019s rebels, supported by Iran, have been waging a revolt and now face the prospect of a decisive military defeat by the Syrian government.\nIsrael, which has been at odds with Iran\u2019s regional allies, has repeatedly threatened to strike Iranian-backed groups in Syria over alleged ballistic missiles, tankers and other weapons.\nEarlier this week Israel launched its third missile strike against military targets in Syria on Thursday, targeting weapons and support systems, killing four Iran-backed Iranian rebels and one Syrian soldier. After the attack Israel and Syria also agreed to suspend their missile strikes on each other\u2019s territory as they continue to try and work out a way out of the standoff.\nAside from the Israeli strikes, Israeli soldiers also crossed over into Syrian territory to help evacuate four Israeli hostages captured in Syria. Last week, one Syrian civilian was killed and another injured after a Syrian artillery shell landed in the village of Zaghreb, near the Israeli border and the Israeli army evacuated the family of the injured Syrian who was injured in Israel.\nIn another development, Syria\u2019s Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi called on the world community to help the Syrian people by supporting the Damascus government in their struggle against terrorism and the terrorist organizations operating in the country.\n\u201cThe Syrian people, government and army are ready for all the sacrifices in their struggle against all enemies, including the terrorists and groups that are supporting terrorism,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\nIn another development, in an interview last week with Al Arabiya, Assad hinted the international community could help in the conflict by stepping up pressure on the government forces to disarm the rebels.\n\u201cWe seek to achieve security,

{"prompt":"The African Union s plan to trim its Somalia peacekeeping force ( AMISOM ) will hurt the mission unless extra equipment is found to offset the troop decrease , the mission s leader told Reuters","text":"The African Union s plan to trim its Somalia peacekeeping force ( AMISOM ) will hurt the mission unless extra equipment is found to offset the troop decrease, the mission s leader told Reuters in Mogadishu on Tuesday.\nThat is one of the big problems with AMISOM, said Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Munjibar, the mission s principal deputy.\n\" The problems of AMISOM, the weaknesses, have come to light, \" he said. \" The first is the troop strength. The second is the financial assistance. We were forced to cut the troops. \"\nAMISOM, composed largely of African troops, has struggled to win over people s hearts and minds after just nine months of trying to hold off a wave of insecurities that has led to rising violence.\nThe force has faced allegations of looting and a lack of discipline between its troops across Somalia s vast interior.\nIn the capital, Mogadishu, AMISOM is still faced with resistance from Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamic group that gained prominence with the rise of radicalism across the Muslim world in recent years.\n\" We need support in all areas to make sure that AMISOM is able to succeed. We need financial assistance, we need vehicles, we need air support, we need logistics support. You know what, we are just a little bit late right now. It needs to be done in the early stages, \" Lieutenant-General Munjibar said.\nAl-Shabaab s fierce resistance has prompted the Somalian government to call for more aid. But that support has proved difficult to obtain, and it has only now become apparent that this could be a problem, according to Lieutenant-General Munjibar.\nAMISOM has said it was trying to find funding to help alleviate some of its financial strains.\n\" We want to see an increased funding and assistance on the level that we require for AMISOM s future, \" Lieutenant-General Munjibar said.\nAMISOM has already faced criticism for its inability to defeat militants.\nAsked whether there were any plans for additional funding, Lieutenant-General Munjibar said that there was nothing imminent as far as he knew.\n\" There is a plan for AMISOM to see some improvements, \" he said. \" We want to be certain that we have enough people. There is a plan in place, but there are issues. \"\nAccording to an African Union representative, the total number of troops on AMISOM stands at 11,000, with 4,000 troops stationed in Mogadishu.\nIt is not yet understood how quickly the troop reduction will come into effect, if at all.\n\" It is important that AMISOM is given the proper support.

He said the port would be handed over to the Yemeni government \u201c upon their acceptance of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on the termination of the conflict. \u201d \u201c The coalition is continuing the humanitarian operation and will continue to provide all its humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen, and we are coordinating to provide all necessary assistance, \u201d he said, stressing that he wasn\u2019t talking about the United Nations Security Council\u2019s arms embargo against the Houthis.\nIn contrast, a senior Houthi official said on television that \u201c with the arrival of thousands of trucks to the port, we are not letting them come out. \u201d He said they would keep it open as \u201c it is not like a customs area or seaport, \u201d but he said that he was aware that the United States was negotiating with the Yemeni government to end the conflict.\nThe conflict in Yemen began two years ago when the Houthi rebels took control of the port, which is one of the country\u2019s main sources of foreign exchange and key targets for the Saudi-led coalition in its campaign to restore power for former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.\nA year ago the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Iran on its support for the Houthis. The embargo was to last 18 months.\nThe Houthis carried out several attacks on Saudi targets in recent months, leading to a war that has killed hundreds of civilians, including several of myriad children, and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes.\nPresident Donald Trump has claimed previously that his administration wants to make the Houthis the ones who leave the country.\nThe announcement came less than two weeks after the United States confirmed on Wednesday that it was stepping up diplomatic pressure on Iran to curb its support of the Houthis, who are being targeted by a coalition of Arab nations sponsored by the United States.","token_len":617,"entropy":[10.0347,1.6617,0.2056,0.2332,4.2562,3.7235,0.8959,4.126,1.5952,2.0569,0.7554,2.4197,6.3466,2.607,3.5689,0.8372,3.0535,2.6894,6.1581,0.8221,0.705,0.0065,2.6025,2.7952,7.9195,1.6733,6.1579,3.3943,2.2269,1.7532,4.4075,2.3308,5.2047,1.9839,5.6848,5.1146,1.1197,4.9047,4.1146,3.1819,4.734,2.7776,2.9922,0.8081,2.108,2.6655,0.0743,5.0719,0.9161,2.7669,1.6337,3.2354,3.027,0.3339,0.4499,0.2758,13.7803,2.944,2.8679,7.0653,0.0317,1.0232,0.0665,0.6842,3.7777,1.3769,0.5426,2.8482,16.2956,7.5663,7.7331,1.7868,4.9965,6.8959,0.1609,5.9618,4.2403,0.3604,1.2222,0.9578,0.3943,0.2257,3.7736,2.7676,0.001,2.1763,5.5661,2.0077,5.1108,0.0057,3.2016,0.9565,4.5793,0.0356,0.1878,1.5234,0.0596,2.0148,0.5795,0.2556,1.6497,3.366,2.6794,0.9162,2.0697,3.3565,2.4159,1.4354,4.3307,5.5289,1.3824,0.1406,2.5283,1.0014,4.5908,1.4946,3.5209,2.4192,0.5495,1.4855,5.0268,3.5532,0.5857,1.3226,6.5983,3.0182,3.054,5.5518,0.0022,0.416,0.6948,4.3753,1.4049,0.0885,7.1704,6.9827,0.1095,6.514,0.6365,5.9504,0.8113,1.7833,6.2142,0.5157,3.181,7.1428,1.7353,4.8966,0.1166,0.6835,0.0007,10.2312,6.6495,2.9101,4.3707,2.3479,1.0459,1.5565,0.5271,2.17,4.8839,6.1199,5.2673,1.7533,3.315,2.7738,0.5099,1.5003,1.8325,0.0767,0.5616,0.1801,3.3023,0.9155,2.2475,2.9403,3.4507,4.1064,1.4921,4.6572,0.197,5.6605,7.8595,4.0469,0.9496,1.0718,3.5265,2.7084,3.914,1.3087,1.224,4.7245,0.8748,0.2538,5.7882,12.303,2.7557,1.6135,0.7164,0.2415,0.2166,5.007,0.1867,0.0187,0.0019,1.0553,0.9735,5.5262,1.8116,7.1577,0.4936,5.1591,0.5667,5.4202,1.1698,6.3317,4.4646,0.8575,2.0398,1.657,1.9417,3.6715,4.1797,6.183,1.7808,1.4879,2.6152,2.0389,0.455,6.7566,6.0086,0.3567,5.0468,0.3264,0.0936,0.4395,3.4987,0.8782,1.0522,3.3437,1.6373,1.2446,8.5518,0.0725,0.1664,0.3938,1.9617,0.2787,4.5668,1.4623,6.6249,4.1933,4.9781,0.6536,0.5393,2.162,0.0461,1.1164,0.0028,1.5764,1.3692,0.2668,12.9195,0.0229,0.3615,1.3087,0.9907,5.5026,3.9088,4.1883,0.2459,1.6909,2.3423,2.5697,4.6014,3.2912,2.2341,2.9442,3.518,1.5145,0.6913,0.416,1.7664,5.2898,3.7884,2.3047,1.6368,0.7243,0.7245,1.2025,0.6903,0.1552,2.5222,3.5585,3.277,1.8806,5.4966,4.9303,2.6081,2.973,2.9018,1.1168,3.3135,5.8605,1.6338,1.1392,0.4279,3.8353,4.3035,0.2793,3.509,6.0562,2.8261,6.8494,0.0423,3.675,0.1008,1.4525,3.6396,0.5033,3.4731,0.0012,1.4583,0.0826,0.7852,7.2931,0.0508,4.3165,0.4645,0.116,0.1494,0.3267,0.1466,3.5217,6.3645,0.5415,3.0622,3.0101,1.9903,0.0044,0.472,1.0099,1.0851,7.1673,0.6157,2.4822,0.2857,6.0023,0.6246,6.4292,0.0322,6.5233,0.1606,6.8918,2.9544,1.1485,0.4481,1.3121,4.6704,2.0703,3.6965,5.1016,1.8944,4.3806,3.5468,2.4309,2.0472,1.291,2.7309,0.832,3.2408,1.8915,5.3019,3.6849,0.1926,3.7079,7.7263,0.7439,3.1724,0.8981,2.7188,5.6519,3.3584,9.4953,4.0126,2.8858,8.9479,0.1342,0.0124,2.4874,1.8698,0.857,2.0426,3.4049,1.4329,1.2773,3.709,2.0852,4.6491,0.9538,1.2444,3.8335,1.8858,1.9772,5.6928,0.4809,0.6453,2.025,0.1179,1.3198,1.9043,0.1813,0.5525,1.0132,0.3141,1.5273,7.7574,1.3424,0.0523,1.2783,5.0487,0.5106,0.0104,1.4213,1.5749,0.5256,1.2423,2.0364,2.7804,0.7233,0.0597,1.0357,2.4014,2.7608,1.2913,1.1254,3.9325,0.0186,0.2117,3.3035,3.7928,2.3085,1.9244,2.097,4.8109,0.0452,3.9921,4.345,1.7307,8.3203,8.0306,0.3548,1.3798,1.5269,0.2672,0.0369,0.1254,3.8916,3.1822,2.5838,1.468,4.0086,3.0425,6.0187,3.8386,0.7428,0.2132,0.0006,0.0006,0.0012,0.4477,0.4911,3.7344,3.0464,0.5355,3.4029,3.2913,1.1511,1.9387,0.001,3.3011,1.7072,0.3455,0.0105,0.4979,4.9224,4.3,4.2951,5.0627,0.5016,0.3219,0.3364,0.2052,1.4824,1.6065,2.1525,1.1547,5.0108,1.5406,6.7806,0.0274,1.437,0.8104,1.5343,1.4251,0.4544,6.8422,0.011,3.1691,1.65,0.7353,1.1308,4.6189,1.0145,1.7045,0.7274,0.8491,5.8638,0.3286,2.091,5.1625,1.2552,0.8217,0.5686,2.6534,0.1533,1.9288,1.6193,1.3367,4.1285,4.9063,14.5569,1.0468,1.4129,1.8947,3.2262,3.0205,0.0069,0.0167,1.3756,0.0138,1.0555,0.0516,0.4013,0.7353,5.9996,4.0088,0.0669,1.8496,5.7554,7.7785,0.1019,3.1816,0.3775,4.453,0.2187,4.6852,1.0818,2.2786,0.1702,2.9636,7.54,1.7242,6.9894,1.2115,0.3371,0.8322,1.0136,1.8016,5.2655,1.385,4.5579,0.0036,1.6289,0.5265,0.113,1.383,1.5302,0.4076,4.7942,3.1191,1.4452,0.2327,0.8016,1.91,5.4479,0.1194,5.1189,3.0391,0.4842,1.7236,0.9698,4.9472,0.4341,1.6784,1.9678,0.2446,0.2119,0.1131,1.6904,1.1864,1.6261,5.5332,3.9926,0.5868,2.857,2.7151,0.2435,2.8867,3.3712,8.4757,0.0972,1.5877,0.615,0.1795,1.1555]}
{"prompt":"Mexico and Central American countries they will lobby U.S. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would end a program","text":"Mexico and Central American countries they will lobby U.S. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would end a program he said could let them remain as Americans.\nThey will meet with congressional Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and members of his campaign, as well as some Republicans, to demand that Congress adopt the same approach that Biden did to provide amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as children.\n\u201cIt affects everybody across this continent, and even beyond that, and we need that kind of compassion,\u201d said Carlos Castillo Herrera, a Honduran activist for immigration rights who will fly to Washington with a group of four other activists on Thursday.\nTrump said a \u201cgreen card\u201d amnesty plan would \u201cfix\u201d the current situation; however, the current \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy would also give the immigrants the opportunity to adjust their status, so they could stay in the U.S. \u201cBecause there\u2019s also that option,\u201d Castillo Herrera told reporters.\nBiden, in his campaign for president, promised for two years to end the migrant crackdown, but he did not provide details on how that might be accomplished. \u201cWe have bipartisan support, with Republicans and Democrats in Congress on this issue. That\u2019s not going to go away if I\u2019m president,\u201d he said in one news conference in October after Trump moved his border security priorities to the front of his national agenda.\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission in Tegucigalpa said Tuesday that the embassy would not confirm or deny the Mexican group\u2019s plans to bring an amnesty bill before the U.S Congress.\nDemocrats who are considering Biden\u2019s plan are demanding immigration reforms based on the notion that the country only has so much resources to offer.\n\u201cMany lawmakers are considering amnesty,\u201d said Nydia Velazquez, the Democratic Congresswoman who is a co-sponsor of Biden\u2019s plan, when asked about the group\u2019s actions on Tuesday. \u201cSome consider it to be a good start, but they want to make sure it includes certain provisions that they feel they\u2019ll need to have.\u201d\nThe \u201cborder patrol\u201d is another term many Democrats and Trump supporters have been using in the media to refer to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which enforces the border. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sending a message to the White House,\u201d Castillo Herrera said. \u201cIf they can go ahead

{"prompt":"Influential exiled Palestinian politician Mohammed Dahlan said on Wednesday Palestinians should reject any future peace talks and halt security coordination with Israel over U.S. plans to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem . Dahlan","text":"Influential exiled Palestinian politician Mohammed Dahlan said on Wednesday Palestinians should reject any future peace talks and halt security coordination with Israel over U.S. plans to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Dahlan, the deputy Prime Minister in Mahmoud Abbas' government and member of the Fatah faction in the Palestinian Authority, told a news conference in London that even if diplomatic efforts are made to bring the Palestinians and the Israeli government together to resume a peace process the West Bank settlement blocs would be preserved by the Palestinians, who have vowed to never allow the creation of a Jewish state. Dahlan said the Palestinians' refusal to agree to a permanent state of their own would undercut the prospects of a two-state solution, but he did not say who would be responsible for the failure of that path. Dahlan said the Palestinian Authority would fight any attempt to make peace with the Jewish state on the status quo or on a land-for-peace deal, saying the Palestinians had no intention of accepting a state with a Jewish majority. \"The status quo in which we live in the West Bank \u2026 is a living death. The status quo is the only one that can lead us to any solution other than two states,\" he said. Palestinians are negotiating with Israel to resume a road map for peace that the Trump administration withdrew midway due to the buildup of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected any change to the status quo in the occupied East Jerusalem, part of the West Bank, saying that Israel must accept Israeli rule there only. U.S. Ambassador George Kent said on Monday that American plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem could cause a delay to U.S.-Israeli peace talks. Abbas has rejected the Trump administration's plan to move the embassy and has said he is prepared to work with the U.K. on moving the embassy. Palestinians say the Israeli annexation in recent months of more Palestinian lands, including Jerusalem, is threatening regional stability and is not consistent with the peace plan of a two-state solution. The Palestinians say they plan to take measures to stop the Trump administration's plan, including a return to the negotiating table, unless Washington backs off. Some people see a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, others see a single Palestinian state in the West Bank surrounded by a Jewish state, and still others see a two-state solution, one state of Jewish and one state of Palestinian citizens. In 2018, about 60 percent of Palestinians believe Israel should hold to the status quo and continue negotiations with the Palestinians, and only 45 percent believe this plan should be accepted as the minimum standard to initiate peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Some Israelis in the West Bank are also split in their opinions on a two-state solution. The survey \u2014 conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute and conducted in 28 different communities in both Israeli settlements and Bedouin areas \u2014 polled 1,006 people.\nAs we prepare to have an in-person spring semester, we wanted to provide a list of how to make your first day at university as smooth and safe as possible.","token_len":618,"entropy":[8.5022,0.5904,13.2186,5.5838,4.3598,5.4985,2.729,0.1207,3.9433,1.3475,2.362,6.5808,1.408,5.31,2.4435,5.1616,2.597,1.3998,2.6146,6.3902,7.7722,2.171,0.6526,0.3651,4.7713,9.2584,0.0154,0.9081,0.5728,2.816,0.131,3.5133,4.5643,2.0886,1.6035,2.8145,1.1893,0.6607,0.3474,3.4043,0.0005,1.117,2.8798,4.4696,6.884,0.0019,3.1105,6.1977,0.0052,0.484,1.8856,3.4886,5.3145,0.0024,0.5721,3.4674,0.0004,2.5323,1.8013,0.453,0.7766,0.493,0.2558,2.73,2.1257,1.7909,0.0129,1.1749,4.5943,0.1877,6.9258,0.5956,8.0357,0.8993,1.9518,3.4403,0.8224,3.6557,1.6734,2.1514,4.3533,2.0297,2.5722,0.4954,1.8704,2.4126,5.0074,3.5729,0.9948,0.5484,5.2211,4.9681,1.5147,3.7177,3.0823,2.0985,1.6535,2.2725,10.0735,4.1406,1.8478,3.51,2.7576,2.0147,1.89,4.3873,0.2204,5.8207,2.9075,1.8226,5.3398,0.0087,0.6088,2.1977,0.1122,0.9991,3.3007,0.0006,1.0101,1.8123,1.8862,3.6177,3.7924,0.1445,3.4078,0.2596,1.4427,5.7694,2.3224,2.1561,3.7695,0.2929,1.4759,7.2713,1.3492,3.3462,0.6732,1.0169,1.8619,0.0777,0.0024,0.0309,2.0904,4.183,1.9006,2.7273,0.0471,2.7251,3.167,0.7808,1.5482,1.4844,0.3455,1.0466,3.6895,0.9125,3.5556,5.9352,0.1842,3.4724,0.0005,1.0664,1.6115,1.9308,1.1823,1.6052,6.798,2.6889,1.5428,0.5236,4.5365,1.2636,0.7305,2.2527,4.4082,0.1803,3.9709,0.9382,8.0182,3.6825,4.8872,3.314,2.9874,5.5858,1.9935,1.1572,0.0273,0.7607,3.4206,1.9013,3.2982,1.8479,1.6867,3.0348,2.2022,3.5832,0.1058,4.9899,1.4876,2.5548,2.8644,1.7735,1.1481,0.6674,0.5367,1.5222,1.8436,5.6532,0.0085,3.6638,4.476,2.017,0.647,3.161,3.6135,0.7706,0.0063,6.8815,0.8602,2.1394,6.0255,5.5575,3.7168,2.0544,2.7698,0.0039,1.3916,2.4272,2.613,2.8717,1.1127,2.0835,4.7263,2.0026,0.3346,4.1397,3.3164,6.036,0.0035,4.9316,1.1971,0.8696,0.7539,0.1512,0.3383,4.1937,3.0086,5.1669,1.383,0.6295,1.5079,4.7121,1.7822,7.6944,2.3261,1.1689,2.3867,2.3569,3.7065,7.9749,0.043,8.2013,9.1811,10.3222,0.0077,1.9162,9.5184,0.0424,2.0638,0.9139,1.0601,0.3463,0.3139,0.0026,0.9038,1.815,2.2045,1.4512,3.6268,1.9963,5.8137,1.4076,0.5584,1.6152,0.01,2.7248,1.1246,3.5776,3.4364,0.3497,1.2397,6.8232,0.0009,1.0856,1.1241,0.001,1.2634,4.2189,1.9652,3.2397,3.4105,3.0412,5.0702,5.9718,3.2841,5.4718,3.9786,4.51,0.0013,0.134,0.0364,3.0309,8.5209,13.096,1.8411,1.4107,3.3826,0.4056,5.9064,6.9556,0.5193,1.4958,0.5888,0.5736,1.4413,0.1304,3.8433,5.0752,2.0274,3.9317,3.7037,4.6306,0.0005,0.0514,1.3704,1.4639,2.1002,0.3298,1.0556,5.454,1.8683,4.351,1.527,6.4336,0.1619,0.0241,2.1529,0.4128,0.8759,0.1737,0.2562,2.3834,2.2039,1.8693,1.478,2.6133,2.3094,0.0156,3.1274,0.1618,1.2538,2.504,0.0005,5.1795,0.1761,1.8534,3.4955,0.3206,0.2396,1.3634,3.9882,3.1188,1.2733,3.7741,4.8406,6.262,5.0322,1.459,0.7887,4.7245,3.8821,2.2854,3.0439,0.8591,3.6853,0.2927,2.5464,5.1572,6.0861,1.4531,0.7703,3.7637,4.6039,4.5115,0.0031,1.196,2.3464,2.6494,3.3198,4.4047,0.132,0.0255,0.001,0.065,0.4783,1.9312,1.5908,2.1104,1.8643,4.6256,0.0706,4.5425,5.8856,0.2842,2.6727,0.9068,8.3314,0.0904,0.7955,1.9144,1.9719,0.7901,2.5669,4.925,0.5295,1.2016,4.3163,0.0235,2.3048,5.3922,3.1744,4.282,1.2492,0.9139,5.3503,5.9,4.7754,2.2229,3.8079,3.1518,2.092,4.0817,0.0015,3.9917,6.8032,0.0499,2.1578,2.7447,8.0164,0.9866,1.0024,6.7298,1.3074,0.1716,1.2346,0.5034,0.4659,0.0017,8.767,0.0439,2.125,3.5032,2.279,1.7731,0.9499,4.0172,0.0273,0.5129,0.963,2.8611,0.0326,0.0038,0.1328,2.823,5.2925,6.6374,4.9025,3.4889,2.1214,0.3613,0.9797,0.0222,1.5643,5.9523,0.4137,3.9131,9.2623,0.184,5.117,3.6504,0.662,0.0238,1.7116,3.2009,2.0357,0.7869,5.2238,5.3372,1.6133,2.3757,0.0594,2.1985,6.3435,4.1166,1.3465,0.4239,0.423,0.914,3.6174,3.7169,4.6474,0.0229,1.2361,5.0119,4.8025,1.0609,0.7523,4.2841,3.8805,1.8057,7.1572,3.7074,3.3061,8.6128,1.3541,0.6313,3.58,1.3073,0.0214,0.1924,0.1398,0.216,4.5519,3.3677,4.5122,0.7769,0.7847,0.0025,3.0999,2.8317,6.0937,4.0273,0.0679,3.6,1.22,3.3675,0.9846,0.0359,0.0016,0.0968,0.5806,2.6344,6.2384,7.7745,1.569,0.9133,1.9152,3.2009,1.8766,0.2957,1.347,2.6776,2.6079,8.2214,3.9548,5.1817,1.3259,5.5826,3.6435,2.4438,0.2251,7.8559,0.0253,0.01,2.3341,0.7469,6.1548,0.8347,0.0027,4.3648,1.5637,2.9809,2.7218,12.5235,4.9417,4.9289,0.6726,6.4437,2.7535,4.2542,0.0681,4.8885,10.3314,5.9024,2.206,1.457,3.9205,0.0347,4.1515,1.6236,5.5253,0.0514,5.2409,3.1296,3.6484,1.6137,5.2325,4.3242,1.659,3.7084,3.4735,6.5188,1.2475,3.7267,0.0758,0.0449,0.433]}
{"prompt":"Mexico s prison population has fallen by a fifth from the peak in 2014 as fewer people are locked up under a new criminal justice system , with experts saying that cases are falling apart","text":"Mexico s prison population has fallen by a fifth from the peak in 2014 as fewer people are locked up under a new criminal justice system, with experts saying that cases are falling apart.\nThe figures, released on Wednesday, show that 32,000 inmates are in Mexican jails, the lowest since 2000.\nBut experts say some jails, like those in Central Mexico City, are in a state of disrepair and some sentences are not being carried out.\n'It is a big failure'\n\"It is a big failure and it's getting worse,\" said the director of Mexicans Together Against Punishment, Javier Valdes.\nWhile violence in prisons has declined, there have been multiple escape attempts and violent overcrowding in jails, forcing several changes to the penal system that has made it harder for convicts to get out.\n\"The problem is there is no justice,\" Mr Valdes said.\n\"There are prisons in the countryside where the criminal justice system does not exist, so prisoners don't have to get out of the prison, they don't have any right to get parole and they never go to the courtroom.\"\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who inherited a dismal prison system, is seeking solutions to the problem by revoking a pardon that allowed some prisoners to serve their sentences at least in part in their communities.\n'You don't have to go to the courtroom'\nThere is no information on whether these prisoners have been rearrested, because the authorities cannot tell whom they have been transferred to, they said.\nIn Veracruz state, for example, about 800 prisoners were transferred to the countryside to do community service for less than three hours a month.\nThat transfer was the longest it had been implemented since 2011 with about 40 per cent of all prisoners having to do at least three hours of community service, the government said, without saying how often that service has been given or what effect the community service had on the prisoners.\nThere, as in many other parts of the country, the so-called system of pre-trial detention has made detainees for minor crimes in prison for up to five years from the time they are arrested.\nDespite complaints about the system, experts say in Mexican prisons there are few cases against pre-trial detainees and those who are convicted often serve small time.\n\"It is a kind of lawlessness, a lack of respect for institutions (\u2026) which prevents people from accessing a remedy,\" Mr Valdes said.\nThe report found that in the three years that pre-trial detainees have been in jails, they were in jail for an average of 30 months.\nThere were about 15,000 pre-trial detainees at the end of 2018, while at the end of 2014 there were about 30,000, the report said.\n'You don't have to go to the courtroom'\n\"The justice is not there, the remedies are not there, (some judges) do not make cases, some even allow detainees to be deported without being interrogated,\" Mr Valdes

{"prompt":"A Japanese man wielding a sword killed his sister , a Shinto priestess , on the grounds of a Tokyo shrine , then stabbed his wife to death before committing suicide , police and media","text":"A Japanese man wielding a sword killed his sister, a Shinto priestess, on the grounds of a Tokyo shrine, then stabbed his wife to death before committing suicide, police and media reports said Saturday.\nThe victim, a 33-year-old Shinto priestess from Hokkaido, was believed to be stabbed 16 times by her brother, 47-year-old Yoshihiro Yamaguchi, said police.\nPolice said Yamaguchi stabbed his sister at the Sento-in Temple on a cold January morning, only days before his wife was found dead on his balcony.\nTwo others were seriously injured later in the attack, one of them in the head, and the other in his neck.\nYamaguchi was also found dead in his home in the central metropolis. Investigators believed the man wanted to commit suicide as well, they said.\nThe cause of the attack has also remained unclear, police and media reported, although police thought it had something to do with Yamaguchi's work as a priestess.\nThe police say Yamaguchi was upset after an argument with his wife, who had left the temple, and that he had been fighting with his sister in the days before she died.\nAnother sister was seriously injured in Yamaguchi's attack, police said, but she was treated at a hospital and would be discharged on Monday.\nA number of other family members were also injured, and Yamaguchi's mother is in a critical condition at a hospital as well. Her son was found beaten by her husband.\n\"I do not want him to die,\" said Yamaguchi's mother. \"I just cannot bear to see him suffer,\" she was quoted by a national broadcaster as saying.\nMany people in the temple, where Yamaguchi had been teaching religious classes, thought he might have had a crisis of conscience over his family's recent problems.\nThe local radio station NHK aired a tape that police say was taken from Yamaguchi's mobile phone by the security guard of a shop nearby.\nThe footage showed Yamaguchi crying, saying \"he knew who was going to die and who wasn't\", and begging for an explanation from a passer-by. The man in the video appears calm and seemingly unaware that the tapes were being made.\nMany people in Aomori, Yamaguchi was from, an island province to the north of Tokyo that is rich in nature and Buddhist culture, thought Yamaguchi was one of the most pious members of his community.\nThe Aomori police chief, Masaki Watanabe, said that during the day people in the temple, which had around 200

The U.R.S.S. has not imposed sanctions on North Korea for years.\n\u201c We want to see greater actions \u2013 and we are working to get those actions, \u201d the official said.","token_len":620,"entropy":[5.0264,0.8379,2.163,16.5018,6.8911,11.5404,2.9158,0.8717,0.0097,3.3524,6.6501,1.737,7.6969,0.8138,8.1957,1.0674,5.2558,0.2264,0.3765,5.5938,0.6881,1.9717,3.974,2.4468,1.2513,0.0195,2.6723,6.5948,2.4709,3.7282,0.5234,2.6541,3.0069,2.1074,4.1872,0.2594,5.5706,10.7393,0.395,6.7414,0.1927,2.3871,3.903,2.1137,0.2506,1.3436,2.7956,7.7533,3.9397,3.0986,5.6655,4.109,0.9207,1.3073,0.0008,0.0407,0.0015,3.9518,0.0073,0.646,0.4496,16.0333,0.8238,3.4249,5.1718,0.8718,2.7641,0.1035,2.4604,2.2422,2.9031,0.064,0.1277,1.3614,4.1743,0.9166,0.8433,2.5027,4.1515,5.3926,1.9497,2.259,0.425,1.5585,5.8782,1.2547,2.459,2.4461,2.836,1.7536,2.9444,0.9171,3.3645,0.0009,0.4515,0.2062,6.6333,2.7351,3.3197,3.4365,5.2963,2.2058,0.572,5.9804,7.7997,1.3563,4.8155,0.0895,5.0187,5.9251,2.732,3.2822,4.3173,4.2682,0.9536,3.6917,2.5455,6.6621,0.0641,6.3937,0.4556,0.2402,1.5235,11.2399,7.3939,3.0081,0.4122,1.3759,2.8507,1.0831,1.2517,0.6513,1.3143,0.1716,5.2987,5.5744,1.7435,2.1775,0.9175,0.8663,1.1028,2.6922,1.0021,1.8099,0.5493,1.958,2.5045,4.4755,5.3568,0.0053,1.3202,3.2953,1.9329,2.437,3.6075,6.4704,7.1313,1.2931,3.5525,3.9228,3.7822,7.2543,4.499,0.1352,3.8369,0.95,2.5374,5.8358,3.4461,2.0118,1.2012,0.0041,3.2071,1.5154,4.35,4.4349,1.1839,2.584,1.1624,1.8472,6.6938,0.8775,2.4384,2.2863,4.7299,6.1557,2.2813,2.8967,0.1806,6.4982,0.6598,0.0467,3.3519,1.6001,0.0119,2.5085,2.9493,2.4517,1.4426,4.2791,2.0375,4.8524,0.6472,1.7402,0.1745,0.2085,0.0317,0.1479,2.4528,2.4774,0.0006,0.01,0.0616,2.6074,2.4117,0.0293,1.4,5.953,1.6231,3.1745,0.9192,1.2412,5.7305,0.03,0.4432,1.5261,7.3285,3.7361,0.8818,1.3658,2.2022,0.047,2.0875,4.7192,5.8343,2.5774,0.8595,1.321,1.4689,1.0212,3.4756,3.6308,0.4409,3.3015,2.429,2.8348,0.668,3.8511,4.1996,1.6379,1.0297,4.8558,0.0423,3.348,6.9509,0.1834,0.563,0.2831,4.4682,3.1699,7.956,1.2565,0.0184,0.2823,3.7333,4.9823,2.6507,2.2089,0.1197,0.0307,4.6322,0.0498,1.6988,3.2044,0.0779,1.9574,0.1466,2.9263,3.6866,6.5735,2.8465,0.6573,8.7955,2.8944,0.2068,2.1233,2.1988,7.5719,0.1221,0.377,0.8422,2.8448,0.6235,10.5423,0.2784,0.5954,1.9602,3.9871,0.5747,1.3174,1.8694,0.0007,0.0162,0.0948,2.8905,5.7623,1.2983,4.5833,2.757,0.0367,0.581,0.0282,3.9463,0.3735,0.8229,0.0117,2.0456,2.5226,5.7283,1.5487,6.4695,0.4649,1.4465,2.0147,6.6332,7.9495,0.182,3.9362,2.6278,7.218,6.597,0.0339,5.4628,1.5449,0.0463,0.1091,0.5282,1.6109,2.5243,4.9842,0.9164,5.6732,0.4783,0.724,2.1984,0.0771,0.5729,4.9831,1.2948,0.7823,6.7906,3.9246,0.3216,3.0392,1.29,3.3013,0.2942,4.3548,1.2934,3.8694,5.0442,5.1952,2.3186,3.4578,7.0896,0.0186,0.229,3.5655,4.5563,0.0047,5.1743,0.6754,0.0017,0.4603,1.6928,5.3576,0.0042,2.0045,0.7737,0.2869,0.3507,1.799,2.1055,0.0008,0.0298,0.1159,4.9252,2.9494,0.0275,5.0011,0.0533,3.3136,1.6148,3.2583,1.9061,4.5449,0.0714,1.0043,3.9017,2.3305,0.0019,3.0903,1.4989,5.5618,3.0418,1.0216,1.089,0.0214,1.687,0.6136,1.5517,0.8223,2.4641,2.5104,0.0481,1.4696,3.3888,2.6993,4.226,1.4819,1.7189,1.1679,0.8609,7.5546,2.1826,0.0007,0.0019,0.3939,5.1999,0.6301,1.2191,0.4555,2.029,0.5853,7.0493,2.7644,3.9752,2.8764,6.1393,0.8842,2.6205,0.1973,3.7492,0.4004,0.2944,0.5107,1.3845,0.3828,2.4405,2.5747,7.188,2.7881,3.8904,4.2837,0.5708,0.0048,1.2346,5.1274,1.5564,0.4894,5.5464,2.9534,2.2537,3.7569,2.6479,7.482,1.7913,1.1168,4.7843,1.1343,3.1381,10.7759,7.6924,2.4081,1.4885,2.84,1.6923,1.4692,0.1459,0.4048,4.0254,0.0774,1.4026,3.6795,2.0679,2.96,6.4129,2.1381,0.0005,0.1101,0.5841,2.2802,3.9602,4.2144,2.1478,1.5057,0.9963,0.5105,0.7818,3.6341,2.4447,2.348,0.0906,4.5395,0.5872,7.5631,4.0864,7.5412,14.8768,6.8003,0.9208,6.3541,0.1934,1.5327,7.3091,0.8913,2.1591,0.1459,3.4932,3.7639,7.9148,0.4734,4.048,0.6747,2.0898,9.004,4.2969,0.8266,0.2776,1.5235,3.2654,2.6752,5.103,2.673,2.4992,1.8423,0.067,2.9292,1.8521,3.2366,1.4187,3.9476,0.0657,2.5515,2.7273,0.1881,4.3576,6.1118,5.864,0.2207,2.0725,4.1587,0.2446,4.3205,1.962,3.08,2.0355,1.0844,0.4843,3.7991,3.9124,7.6552,5.8499,3.9119,2.441,0.4478,0.0863,1.7982,3.3033,1.2602,2.312,0.0975,1.6176,1.5777,5.5197,2.6141,1.9469,0.0008,10.402,0.0191,0.8035,0.131,6.3274,0.0421,11.8521,2.1968,2.4927,1.5128,0.8156,0.3556,0.0271,2.6651,4.4483,0.9368,0.507,2.0029,0.2955,4.2454,2.1608,0.7859,2.8844,5.7586,6.8124,8.498,2.6243,1.8953,2.3497,3.2322,2.2355,2.5335,2.2417,1.006,4.0955,1.0834,0.1945,0.6365,0.3351,0.1374,0.0666]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump , who pledged to help protect young people known as \u201c Dreamers \u201d brought illegally to the United States as children , called on Sunday for money to fund a border","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to help protect young people known as \u201c Dreamers \u201d brought illegally to the United States as children, called on Sunday for money to fund a border wall to contain rising immigration pressure.\n\u201cWe must fund a wall in the same way, \u201d Trump tweeted.\nTrump is taking aim at immigration as part of his effort to build his brand of hardline, tough-guy populism as the GOP presidential nominee and as a campaign strategy that is also gaining much traction with voters from other key swing states, many of whom worry about large immigrant populations. Immigrants make up more than one-fifth of California\u2019s population and about 3 percent of Florida\u2019s.\nA wall between the United States and Mexico could come down to a legal point of law after a federal judge said he would review whether it has legal standing.\nTrump said Mexico would soon accept the millions of dollars the U.S. has offered to provide some kind of guarantee of no further border crossings, but the proposal has stalled.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. has not made that commitment, \u201d Trump said at the Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d show. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important we do \u2026 that\u2019s why I want to make sure they get very important money. \u201d\nThe wall Trump wants could cost at least $25 billion, including new border patrol forces, border fencing, new buildings for immigration authorities and infrastructure investments.\nMost of Congress passed Trump\u2019s \u201c Protect the Dream Act \u201d through a provision in the \u201c Dreamers \u201d bill back in June.\nThe legislation would have delayed deportations of Dreamers until the end of 2020, but Trump was angered by the law.\nTrump has said his administration\u2019s action to block his \u201c Protect the Dream \u201d bill \u201c was the biggest mistake I have ever made. \u201d Trump suggested last month he\u2019d allow Congress to take another look at the law.\nThe \u201c Dreamers \u201d bill was a critical piece of legislation that could move ahead, but wasn\u2019t given final approval until about a week before Trump\u2019s July 5 victory in the presidential election, although congressional leaders were confident the law would be ratified just before the end of the 10-day recess at the end of July.\nA federal judge in Manhattan agreed with Trump\u2019s argument that the bill has little or no standing. It has languished in Congress and is unlikely to move ahead, although Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the law had never been in a better spot politically than it is now.\nAfter Trump\u2019s defeat, some Democrats criticized Trump politically, saying they would be willing for the president-elect to support the border wall. They also pointed out that his supporters have shown much opposition to the wall over the past two years and that Trump\u2019s critics have shown much support for the Wall in the past year.","token_len":620,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.6708,1.8632,5.7616,0.6139,5.4473,5.0441,6.4768,1.4581,8.9577,0.3766,12.8844,7.0824,9.8403,0.012,1.8796,5.4785,7.3488,8.2822,1.8514,0.1117,0.8086,0.002,3.2943,0.3439,0.8343,5.2541,1.6766,6.3921,0.8965,8.5615,0.8272,4.1619,1.9419,5.0547,0.166,2.9713,6.7176,6.5121,2.2069,7.7955,0.4912,0.2416,16.1796,1.8124,8.0732,1.5989,5.5428,1.3055,0.6117,3.8403,1.6651,6.6064,0.1573,4.9958,7.5325,4.2323,4.0688,3.5742,1.0841,0.733,4.4733,3.7951,4.5597,2.226,0.0262,4.084,3.9958,3.3852,0.0044,0.5374,3.9713,0.0154,2.9111,2.8581,3.7298,2.429,3.99,1.7847,3.7911,4.7314,0.2896,4.3894,2.2677,5.3687,2.8681,2.5632,2.7744,0.4359,3.7838,3.0251,0.8777,6.6431,4.517,3.1982,3.1916,4.6345,4.0377,9.1284,0.8157,3.3525,2.2344,5.5786,3.4459,5.3218,1.1951,0.0488,2.3074,5.6593,0.0989,0.2347,5.7089,1.0161,7.8777,5.5966,0.6988,0.9227,7.1607,0.2949,3.2507,0.0032,2.6968,0.0066,2.8604,0.2267,1.6092,0.012,7.2484,11.8847,6.2672,5.2571,0.9729,1.7043,4.5178,4.4102,1.2059,0.0349,6.6091,2.131,0.0261,0.0202,1.145,0.5269,5.7245,5.2944,3.8609,0.1596,1.2374,0.0007,0.0208,0.0208,2.9643,5.8539,2.7181,0.8182,2.0867,6.7688,4.2954,1.7265,5.5277,5.6867,2.0929,2.948,0.137,4.5068,3.343,1.6231,3.6318,3.0143,2.7393,4.4298,4.8388,2.047,0.9913,0.7579,3.0962,2.8295,5.0233,1.0953,7.0155,4.613,2.5519,4.3234,0.1393,3.4371,2.9774,1.8632,0.0005,0.0012,0.0314,1.9484,4.9532,1.3208,5.046,5.3167,3.8931,0.001,6.7909,2.0058,8.8383,4.0483,3.5614,3.6426,1.6612,1.8698,2.7362,4.3622,1.9656,3.8655,2.0561,0.4792,2.3328,0.1369,8.1399,0.1921,1.7852,2.9497,0.0009,0.0018,0.0869,1.6796,2.1995,3.7293,2.6231,1.1173,1.8684,3.9184,1.2558,0.7233,0.5204,3.5982,2.5144,6.2437,0.6885,0.1517,6.2237,1.5825,2.7079,10.801,1.7306,6.6649,1.2308,0.0007,3.9646,3.0583,2.5855,0.6183,4.5966,0.2254,4.1754,2.8321,7.1866,3.4195,0.0638,3.0886,1.6446,2.4955,1.9437,8.0922,4.2996,4.7627,4.0181,2.2219,6.2356,2.8031,2.1819,0.2678,3.2303,0.6198,4.7759,2.5853,5.9045,5.2038,3.2161,2.0937,2.9954,1.5862,2.512,2.6506,2.5176,5.1487,3.2152,4.7741,2.5719,2.8935,0.004,0.1838,4.3341,0.1573,1.2932,4.0374,6.1043,4.2996,4.2147,5.8178,1.067,4.3242,2.739,0.9272,3.7271,5.1742,3.8416,4.4439,4.3822,0.7597,4.7397,4.5385,0.915,0.5464,6.33,0.5758,8.6601,5.4047,5.1193,7.5769,0.2995,0.0363,12.0644,0.2424,6.9161,2.9839,0.1612,0.0388,5.155,0.9764,5.1542,1.7763,5.5227,0.8123,0.3792,11.5684,0.9547,6.0342,3.5452,4.7977,0.115,1.0794,7.5687,0.0462,3.5703,0.7947,1.0808,2.1162,2.0336,1.7236,1.7643,7.5835,3.3618,0.0037,1.4744,2.0671,0.0279,4.4122,2.5697,1.3967,0.0025,4.3035,1.1043,1.8014,3.08,4.6673,7.062,0.7364,1.0608,4.1528,3.2428,0.698,3.0397,2.6053,1.7864,3.3027,1.9573,10.0586,0.3858,0.0347,5.6581,2.8539,3.8691,4.2402,11.6199,0.2027,5.0341,0.3269,0.0007,5.7776,0.0104,1.3431,6.8459,2.1864,1.6305,3.9667,4.9922,1.6131,7.0317,1.1301,0.2786,0.0928,0.7606,2.8456,0.5492,4.4866,5.5498,4.8454,1.5115,2.4307,4.6899,0.2562,3.48,5.6537,3.3406,0.1127,3.1841,5.1396,1.863,0.2092,0.8234,2.4622,1.4547,0.4053,2.3138,9.383,0.1125,1.269,0.3636,0.4778,0.0135,0.2969,2.2368,3.0078,4.3654,0.9306,0.1414,0.6767,1.048,3.6771,6.2168,4.4652,3.1385,1.1126,6.405,1.2678,2.6776,0.0435,5.2342,4.6438,0.9887,1.3894,6.19,0.9568,1.4406,1.4505,2.1063,1.9772,0.0531,0.0438,6.8938,3.3761,3.5584,2.333,0.7255,2.3985,0.1171,2.4587,6.4522,4.9676,1.5535,2.8475,4.2104,2.1351,3.5135,0.3452,1.2691,4.0855,7.3107,1.5504,0.9902,1.835,0.0041,0.4006,8.733,0.212,0.5531,2.9657,5.6885,0.6755,0.0395,0.0015,2.6359,0.1039,0.245,3.9481,4.0776,0.1933,1.1156,5.8096,5.0733,1.2529,1.0103,2.1929,0.0393,0.0097,2.6508,0.8249,0.753,2.1638,4.8288,4.0626,2.6198,0.1253,2.9475,1.4031,5.0719,3.0845,5.0815,0.0014,0.5526,2.1094,3.5293,1.6769,3.5053,0.0143,3.3356,3.8238,3.0271,4.1957,4.8253,2.0971,0.0254,1.4343,0.0005,2.7357,3.043,3.2158,3.1658,5.6021,0.3657,4.1824,3.459,4.0224,4.4497,6.1577,0.5868,0.4242,0.6218,0.5648,0.2179,0.1791,5.6648,1.9244,1.8255,0.0271,0.0066,4.0849,0.5187,3.7464,2.6895,3.8512,2.6198,12.2182,2.0095,1.6977,2.3908,2.4583,2.8673,2.7507,7.2722,2.1513,1.747,3.3832,0.0026,0.0774,3.7686,1.7697,6.1586,0.1266,1.4128,4.2012,1.7418,3.6498,1.4707,0.2626,3.3979,3.5402,2.0239,4.5639,5.5331,5.6982,0.1129,1.4413,1.265,4.9134,0.1356,0.907,2.4789,0.8428,2.6105,1.3712,3.3739,2.9489,0.0457,0.0058,5.0728,1.2669,3.487,2.8098,2.1209,0.8244,1.3033,6.9411,2.2581,1.1304,0.1229,4.6598,0.5318]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Republicans are making one last attempt to overhaul Obamacare before a special parliamentary procedure allowing the bill to pass with a simple majority expires at the end of this month . The latest","text":"U.S. Senate Republicans are making one last attempt to overhaul Obamacare before a special parliamentary procedure allowing the bill to pass with a simple majority expires at the end of this month. The latest move \u2013 and probably the most crucial \u2013 takes place Friday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) offering an amendment to the bill that calls for health insurance to be sold mainly on the basis of benefits and cost.\n\u201cThe current health care law allows insurance sales to be based on one or more of these factors, but not all at once,\u201d McConnell said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThis amendment would do what is right and replace the current law with a fully fair, transparent, and responsible health care policy that will work for Americans.\n\u201cAs the GOP has done before, we will offer this amendment as a means to give the American people a chance to provide the leadership that is required. If they approve it we hope it will be an important step on the path to fixing our broken healthcare system.\u201d\nSo far, the House has only approved one piece of legislation aimed at repealing Obamacare passed by a simple majority \u2013 the so-called \u201cProtect the Broken\u201d Act \u2013 the Democrats in the House have refused to bring the bill up for its final approval.\nIn a statement on Friday, President Joe Biden said the bill \u2013 if approved by the Senate \u2013 should be enacted as quickly as possible. Biden said \u201cif it doesn\u2019t pass, the risk of more disruption to our health systems will only grow worse\u201d.\nOn top of that, the White House said President Biden was preparing to launch a new coronavirus task force, with Dr. Anthony Fauci as its chairman, which will focus on developing guidance for schools, businesses, and other parts of society as well as developing a vaccination program.\nThe proposed rules from the Department of Labor would mandate that some employers take a phased approach to hiring workers, with the hiring process beginning with the highest quality workers at companies that have been able to maintain their existing workforce.\nEmployers would initially be permitted to hire all employees who are still employed by a company that has not been forced to shut down. This phase would likely last through the end of this year, after which the labor department would gradually allow more and more employees to apply for jobs.\nThe new rules on phased hiring essentially prohibit mass lay-offs and other employment actions that would force people to lose their health care coverage. The rules would also apply to most state and local governments and their employees as well.\nThe Department of Labor proposes a 90 day waiting period before an employer can remove a worker from payroll. The department plans to make the change effective 90 days from this Friday, February 22.\nThe rules also propose a gradual extension of unemployment benefits to workers whose employment stops. These employees would receive $600 per week for 30 weeks. The funds to cover this benefit would be derived from a general fund from the coronavirus relief fund and would first be made available to unemployed Americans.","token_len":620,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6722,4.971,2.174,5.2147,5.8255,1.6366,1.0948,0.2522,5.7304,2.51,3.1491,3.3331,3.7884,9.0622,3.7436,7.7856,1.9334,3.3787,0.0841,1.7755,4.9378,1.0925,0.5039,0.0377,12.3529,2.2487,0.3944,0.0259,0.0012,1.891,0.8145,0.1485,2.9286,4.4525,3.5548,7.107,3.6034,6.5761,0.5612,1.1896,5.0071,0.9679,5.7719,3.4287,4.1192,4.7437,4.2585,1.3879,0.0373,0.0892,0.0002,1.464,0.0124,0.0653,2.3147,0.4729,5.6252,2.8977,0.6502,0.5569,1.2731,1.3086,0.8177,4.9725,0.1933,6.7066,1.4179,1.6971,0.3188,3.2524,11.0876,2.3585,1.0287,5.6665,0.0562,4.6513,2.4676,3.936,2.633,0.697,18.911,8.97,5.3189,5.745,2.9703,0.5984,0.6048,3.5809,3.0472,6.9914,0.5995,0.8214,3.17,0.1713,4.8992,2.5903,0.3463,1.5086,3.4873,2.3816,0.8567,1.6809,3.6212,1.7333,6.1528,0.1831,1.7581,10.8475,7.9982,5.0486,0.8922,1.6125,0.4703,0.3747,3.0699,1.5116,0.321,7.4516,0.1371,3.5456,1.6802,1.1518,5.5166,4.5544,3.2123,4.15,2.7567,7.5536,0.7906,0.7925,0.8944,0.429,0.5208,5.2603,5.7377,1.9153,2.5297,0.974,0.5077,4.5508,2.2579,0.3044,4.9166,1.3208,3.6371,4.463,0.4001,5.4818,1.6745,1.3769,1.5483,0.0896,4.2449,2.6134,4.5229,2.9424,4.0,3.2988,0.3837,4.3612,1.9521,5.6057,3.4862,0.2635,2.7039,0.7766,4.0963,0.5795,4.4254,2.065,0.3733,0.0142,1.3792,3.015,0.0687,6.7123,2.5929,7.7225,2.4674,2.6521,2.6618,4.631,4.0544,3.5881,5.4016,1.8195,4.554,5.5287,3.1781,0.2019,1.2278,3.6462,1.3,0.6162,4.6979,0.7247,1.7278,0.2397,4.8418,1.6247,0.3583,1.44,0.0174,0.6247,2.4711,4.9775,0.4855,6.0664,2.1834,0.3889,1.4656,2.8728,1.0399,2.9866,2.2439,2.5511,3.6016,0.0273,0.8265,4.9544,0.0175,2.7356,0.9646,8.706,0.9533,2.5194,2.5098,0.0317,3.4321,1.5656,3.5057,0.0215,0.0011,10.6415,2.012,5.5564,2.9833,16.3541,6.8365,3.8004,2.313,2.8585,5.3775,7.6169,4.8795,0.3293,1.1283,1.9036,3.7985,0.0554,5.1197,2.4105,0.7371,1.5435,0.3005,8.1186,2.228,4.0108,0.9123,1.1795,3.561,1.748,1.1419,1.5568,1.994,0.1292,4.9768,9.792,0.164,1.0182,1.8307,2.5416,5.9154,3.6651,2.4741,1.5575,0.3923,0.4052,0.3973,4.341,1.1514,6.1256,2.6062,2.3207,0.0677,0.0269,0.9695,6.1119,1.4503,8.924,0.31,5.1879,2.2834,3.7992,9.0634,10.747,2.585,1.5893,1.074,1.7874,6.5824,0.7318,5.2554,6.1045,1.0132,2.8522,1.314,5.9282,1.882,4.3554,1.5312,4.9362,4.3591,1.8098,5.9497,0.2876,4.7427,5.3736,0.0007,0.906,0.0486,1.4721,3.3951,0.0007,2.8178,5.4782,7.3015,2.8329,6.3037,0.583,5.3046,0.701,2.7698,11.7141,2.4853,0.9185,6.0572,0.0621,2.5895,3.6766,6.6782,0.0901,4.5635,3.0081,0.4183,0.0239,2.9176,2.4675,5.0753,0.909,3.5826,1.415,2.1854,0.0691,3.8545,7.8803,1.0525,9.5277,1.7088,4.6012,0.3384,0.4368,1.53,6.2745,0.0046,4.6854,4.3218,0.8413,0.0492,3.7362,2.3781,6.5267,1.5381,1.1023,0.4254,2.257,6.9259,7.2706,5.2453,0.4803,4.2205,0.0048,4.8285,1.8577,5.4628,0.7483,5.5715,1.9502,4.6134,2.4029,9.1584,0.3274,0.2858,2.757,2.6232,1.876,3.5075,1.7811,6.7921,3.1937,4.2209,2.9319,1.1307,5.9533,4.7176,2.3207,3.3966,5.2968,1.2534,2.2104,3.1171,4.3102,0.0047,5.3249,1.9195,3.1606,1.5903,0.8245,0.8937,6.2178,0.2409,0.688,7.9987,1.2977,5.617,0.0259,2.1731,5.6055,1.506,2.403,1.6126,5.9622,2.7817,2.0902,1.9979,0.6874,2.2071,1.2541,1.9273,1.6142,4.6769,0.1848,4.8327,0.0715,1.566,3.1673,6.2016,1.5637,4.5893,3.3187,2.9868,0.972,1.619,0.0026,2.1261,0.3589,0.9085,3.7202,0.2657,1.5697,6.0004,2.0141,0.4377,6.5633,5.076,4.6595,3.3528,0.0496,1.6982,0.2486,3.3056,0.2994,2.7657,0.8282,0.4951,1.7026,3.2392,0.9876,6.112,7.9791,0.3582,7.8189,4.0434,8.4555,7.1446,3.5251,0.2349,1.9547,2.8713,5.5199,3.1341,1.2396,1.6026,5.0603,4.1984,0.5764,6.0478,0.5316,4.6938,2.4998,0.6003,0.9486,2.3664,2.8494,1.639,0.5308,3.4842,0.2293,5.7088,4.6017,1.4284,0.0981,2.1413,2.5933,4.1446,1.2197,3.1647,0.1032,1.2302,0.3802,1.6371,3.5665,0.0257,0.2387,7.0964,2.128,6.8532,2.4486,1.4451,0.0533,1.8181,3.083,1.2523,0.4418,5.0495,1.5875,0.6727,1.1668,8.4152,1.1986,1.9377,4.3791,4.7085,0.0588,3.789,1.7853,5.051,3.0969,6.9912,0.008,3.1259,4.4296,5.1905,1.2723,5.0711,3.819,1.0052,0.5379,1.5944,3.7535,1.6385,4.8519,2.0313,6.6506,5.4201,0.2284,5.0889,0.6925,1.8394,3.3481,3.9591,3.1774,6.4149,2.3555,3.7436,3.7224,0.7462,3.0908,4.1859,5.6273,1.8619,1.6992,2.3073,5.0778,1.3907,2.4339,2.0118,8.1639,5.5968,2.278,2.4528,3.9913,0.7572,0.8178,6.7699,0.2114,1.7771,6.538,2.2665,4.9259,0.6878,14.8874,0.0023,0.0054,7.1178,0.7702,2.5711,1.7317,7.1882,0.3303,5.7278,0.0105,0.6497,4.4666,4.3509,1.5282]}

They are also subject to discrimination in Myanmar.\nOthers have labelled this the worst ethnic conflict in the Buddhist-majority country in decades.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International, which last week unleashed an \"urgent appeal\" for protection, criticised the pope for refusing to call on the Burmese security forces or condemn the atrocities.\n\"Any international intervention should begin with the removal of this military regime. This is crucial and absolutely fundamental,\" said John Holmes, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific director.\nThe pope flew to Bangladesh on Air Force One in a chartered flight and landed at Dhaka's international airport without being mobbed by crowds of journalists, who have come in droves every year to greet the pontiff on International Day of Peace.\nHe gave speeches at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Monday and Tuesday, but did not meet any leaders during those meetings. He did attend a meeting on Wednesday with human rights, humanitarian and development organisations and a meeting with refugees.","token_len":620,"entropy":[8.7383,8.8847,0.5439,8.8406,1.4226,2.329,3.7365,2.56,2.6103,0.3529,4.5762,2.7262,0.364,4.508,5.0947,5.0006,2.4296,0.0028,0.8232,4.2449,0.019,4.8751,0.5023,2.64,7.4208,6.2838,2.6273,3.9261,4.4531,2.6988,4.8035,2.0143,3.1529,0.1499,1.0476,9.3736,6.5591,0.8836,1.4953,2.8128,1.8699,5.7041,0.0247,1.258,2.6157,4.2537,0.637,3.6993,4.7978,1.0047,0.7169,1.6123,0.239,4.8792,1.9095,0.1532,10.6047,9.389,0.7781,3.4516,1.8639,14.924,1.4927,0.4279,0.004,0.5578,7.1498,0.0019,0.0055,0.0913,3.2535,0.0009,2.0241,0.0533,0.0747,0.0152,0.0231,0.0624,0.0052,0.0416,0.0009,0.0009,0.0014,0.0023,0.0008,0.002,0.0098,0.0046,0.0014,0.0039,0.0044,0.0005,0.0134,0.003,0.0156,0.0031,0.0004,0.003,0.0002,0.0503,0.0029,0.0015,0.0108,0.0002,0.0005,0.0039,0.012,0.0026,0.0481,0.003,0.0022,0.0014,0.0008,0.0012,0.0018,0.0021,0.0081,0.0012,0.031,0.1274,0.0015,0.0022,0.0031,0.0003,0.0027,0.003,0.0104,0.2477,13.4503,1.8652,5.2394,10.1158,1.1364,0.3466,4.0233,3.5429,6.132,2.1802,3.5417,0.6333,1.4005,1.7084,2.0821,3.5862,1.0757,3.8871,2.5593,0.0261,5.8801,2.8244,1.5732,2.4082,4.9436,1.5718,5.4777,1.3952,4.6948,0.001,0.4937,4.7648,2.7949,2.0577,6.6666,5.0776,4.3085,0.4757,4.2492,2.2225,1.9351,5.1798,1.2363,3.9856,0.2196,7.9334,4.0333,0.3874,0.099,1.6304,3.9498,2.4447,5.9508,2.746,0.9351,2.7918,4.9957,2.0791,3.0093,2.1213,3.1018,0.9886,1.5743,1.5258,4.6242,0.005,3.5567,2.9117,5.4975,1.1438,6.5593,5.9559,5.2483,0.2817,2.6314,2.1405,2.9994,4.0634,7.7968,1.5582,0.0175,1.0489,4.781,1.8757,8.9162,0.6357,1.8999,2.7543,5.8558,1.0071,1.678,1.4879,3.0551,0.9651,3.1861,1.133,2.7181,0.0306,1.528,7.6136,4.9702,1.4723,6.4682,1.6759,2.0802,0.1639,0.4963,2.211,1.3575,0.6826,1.2299,0.5859,4.5281,1.747,5.7393,0.3311,1.1741,1.347,5.5204,1.5631,4.2524,1.1979,0.2696,2.9697,2.7163,5.4091,0.4328,1.9375,0.9213,7.8573,2.5565,0.7601,1.77,3.2816,1.9941,2.2038,2.7073,0.3655,0.0833,3.3598,5.7698,3.4484,1.8921,1.4024,2.808,1.3749,2.6984,5.4085,0.4412,5.116,4.0821,0.2402,0.6143,2.8352,5.3124,1.6264,2.8923,1.6443,3.6455,2.2767,4.4335,2.2478,4.7085,3.0437,2.244,2.0602,2.2644,1.8852,0.0001,4.0334,0.8984,0.0291,2.4257,2.4665,0.1439,0.0413,1.564,1.2364,4.2791,1.3252,0.0072,5.3142,0.0379,0.0156,1.9597,2.1551,0.0833,2.0103,1.2116,1.5929,1.0911,1.3448,3.2875,3.8143,0.631,3.8446,2.4367,3.937,0.5261,8.5639,3.7785,1.7366,6.1921,5.8978,0.6832,0.0673,3.2956,5.3079,0.0025,1.0834,0.4987,3.9472,2.9487,0.3726,0.1753,1.6281,8.1165,0.2013,2.4303,2.6379,2.505,1.7259,0.0335,2.5864,4.0789,1.8977,5.8285,2.0778,1.0131,7.0908,1.8871,3.4465,3.7778,1.1177,2.6954,1.8738,5.2153,0.149,0.3594,2.7267,3.7457,2.7877,1.2604,2.5494,1.3091,4.8886,3.5269,3.1278,8.5646,0.0044,1.2616,1.0512,1.0787,3.5459,5.405,1.2363,5.2946,0.0097,1.2251,0.0625,7.9864,0.002,0.0015,2.0732,2.2286,4.8481,2.4454,1.5792,2.6366,0.5174,4.5769,0.0014,6.01,0.5768,2.274,2.5525,3.3335,7.3381,0.6778,5.4274,4.4812,3.6786,2.0546,2.9635,6.0459,0.2573,4.356,0.1024,7.6414,1.7097,0.9474,3.5123,0.6113,3.4912,1.4212,1.9006,3.8623,0.0043,3.0759,1.798,2.9091,2.1676,0.2035,9.662,1.91,8.1501,5.6611,3.6701,1.6916,3.7589,2.5425,0.3827,1.5432,3.3401,0.1765,0.0198,0.6418,2.3815,1.1956,0.6554,0.3619,7.6064,0.6104,2.9701,0.203,0.0212,4.1706,0.3871,4.689,1.3386,9.7641,2.4343,5.163,1.7895,0.0076,5.9459,0.1253,0.8882,5.6534,2.8265,5.4591,0.3094,1.4298,0.795,4.4858,0.0422,3.5351,2.0134,0.8426,6.3204,0.0036,0.0,4.7361,0.1679,4.1989,7.9778,0.6503,3.5842,1.1094,0.1948,1.8851,5.7508,5.4589,3.9703,3.4585,5.3387,0.566,1.6134,6.236,0.0422,4.5878,3.9748,1.6763,3.5311,2.9156,1.0484,9.0305,3.9341,6.3426,5.4041,1.4771,0.4032,3.7805,9.1082,0.1501,1.287,0.3219,2.5335,2.9957,0.0107,0.6554,0.1655,0.2322,2.579,1.2447,5.5359,0.2863,1.0163,0.3639,11.4061,0.2618,0.1095,3.5553,1.4305,7.7707,0.0014,2.8467,3.1954,4.85,1.3958,3.7115,0.0093,1.8775,3.7422,0.0088,5.4701,2.8266,8.8499,0.0008,0.6559,5.1512,1.0665,4.9842,1.5332,3.7021,4.7665,4.2624,3.1061,3.4076,0.0,9.0138,2.9533,0.6597,4.6636,0.9058,1.5023,0.0016,3.18,8.4756,2.1614,0.3059,3.0946,0.3966,0.1655,2.1097,5.1798,6.285,1.8939,1.2317,3.951,0.0096,3.3507,0.6639,0.061,0.0044,2.5709,3.2946,1.2882,5.1147,1.105,2.7896,2.1587,0.0242,4.09,3.2489,2.738,5.0983,3.7366,3.4207,0.5658,3.1104,1.9636,3.3399,0.7801,1.7404,3.6891,2.4676,0.8592,6.3922,0.0052,6.4311,3.3042,0.7263,2.4439,5.3565,2.302,2.8514,2.9724,0.6846,6.3999,2.624]}

He wrote in his initial statement that he \u201cwent in there at that moment and was advised by a supervisor to stay out of the office where all employees are working.\u201d\nThe Washington Post reports that the president directed one of his aides to stand outside of a closed door while the assistant and his staff waited in the hall to discuss an \u201cemergency.\u201d\nAt least one employee told The Post that he was standing outside the door when he heard a knock at the front door.\nWhen the door opened, he was told that it was an emergency call about \u201cLeandra English\u201d and that he was expected to go work on the president\u2019s call. He was \u201cnot allowed to leave the door\u201d until the meeting finished, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\u201cThen a few people came in and spoke to him, not on behalf of him, but on behalf of the administration,\u201d one employee said in a memo. \u201cHe was then directed to do some \u2018extra work\u2019 for one of the Biden appointees.\u201d\nOn Monday, Leandra English did the legal work of a federal contractor at the CFPB while being placed under a gag order restricting her from talking to the media or even interacting with staff on the phone, court documents show.\nShe was also allowed to use the agency\u2019s computer with the intention of saving a project to a USB drive, court documents show. She eventually refused to do so, but said she would continue to do it until she was removed from her office, the Post reports.\nShe said that her actions were required to be as safe as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in more than 6.3 million cases and over 147,000 deaths in the United States as of Monday.\n\u201cAs a lawyer, as a consumer rights advocate, and as a friend of President Biden and the American people, this is the only way,\u201d lawyer Jennifer Enoch wrote in the statement. \u201cThis directive to remain locked down is unlawful, but the CFPB will continue to operate with staff as necessary.\u201d","token_len":621,"entropy":[10.1252,7.6495,1.6429,3.2687,2.0328,3.8546,2.9937,5.0499,1.2475,0.6858,1.7332,5.7575,1.0643,0.3248,4.6051,2.4609,6.2066,7.1573,0.1501,0.4021,5.525,0.0335,0.0,0.0023,0.3537,4.3632,11.9854,4.9685,4.168,3.4017,1.2902,3.0485,3.5288,4.0051,0.3434,2.5955,4.9299,2.8442,4.3684,2.1554,0.4487,2.9255,0.3753,0.1319,1.1865,0.0458,0.2014,0.2287,18.5321,8.5337,5.96,3.0524,4.3476,3.1696,5.2196,2.394,0.877,1.9436,3.4307,4.0478,1.6998,3.4883,2.9657,2.302,1.6436,6.573,7.0988,1.8813,4.5798,4.8964,0.9431,5.6848,1.0506,1.1611,3.5533,0.9562,6.1868,9.1612,8.071,8.3574,0.2847,0.7224,5.3294,6.0909,5.1591,3.0798,1.2904,2.2657,0.3328,0.2809,4.4894,3.304,0.137,4.8637,0.4418,5.3667,3.906,2.7416,0.8334,6.9667,2.1491,0.1094,4.4176,1.9268,2.7274,0.3049,0.234,0.3976,6.6007,0.0104,11.7081,4.1185,1.6252,0.1055,5.4963,2.4521,5.7571,2.5281,7.1626,3.908,3.9488,5.3617,4.4694,0.1873,2.5868,3.8799,1.8387,0.1502,0.9049,5.4284,3.72,4.0425,0.63,0.7224,1.8458,2.7915,4.202,0.4747,0.3587,0.9826,0.0272,2.9164,1.3748,1.2451,2.3844,0.0875,3.5496,8.5546,0.0071,0.0124,5.1515,4.7147,2.2974,1.7297,9.7673,5.5338,4.4662,2.6121,0.6619,0.868,3.5325,1.3712,4.6136,0.6073,1.2908,1.3128,4.6799,4.3301,4.5411,3.376,2.0808,1.14,6.4314,1.4795,3.8626,0.0707,3.3368,6.1135,2.0149,1.5044,6.0158,1.1932,0.6293,0.5076,10.0928,0.6135,6.8109,3.822,5.2674,5.1983,5.1313,1.7911,2.5984,2.3839,5.6862,1.6362,1.9783,2.3896,1.9937,1.7967,2.7004,0.153,0.4668,1.2251,5.762,5.129,2.9744,1.7699,3.3187,0.9767,3.5748,4.4742,0.8754,2.4058,4.9499,0.0979,2.2154,0.339,1.489,3.3244,5.5339,6.5793,0.6405,1.139,2.6054,0.2206,5.2166,2.2107,2.6319,4.3149,3.9668,1.4003,4.2795,1.6519,5.649,5.1935,2.772,2.1144,2.846,2.6515,1.5564,4.1735,2.1085,4.2245,3.5911,13.8055,0.4448,2.872,0.0066,3.6203,3.5278,1.3664,0.6972,5.3147,2.6193,1.0244,1.9285,2.7317,2.2813,0.2026,0.3623,1.763,1.5044,4.7617,0.8132,1.4023,1.8601,1.1039,1.3639,0.5528,1.5931,3.6254,1.7701,0.9757,2.199,0.3686,0.6019,1.0284,4.5491,1.2617,1.7702,0.7254,0.2932,1.752,2.7678,1.086,1.7339,3.1206,0.2016,2.9394,2.4398,3.3792,5.1486,11.2301,0.0754,7.0378,0.0076,0.0168,1.6299,5.5427,4.1051,0.8676,1.5518,1.2547,4.5387,0.1044,4.2609,7.2429,3.2008,1.4604,4.9244,3.2254,0.5535,0.0531,5.7041,0.4559,3.1493,1.7571,10.5662,0.2613,3.596,1.8643,0.5051,0.847,0.6071,3.138,6.6852,2.0406,1.512,1.8024,6.1976,6.6714,1.5524,3.7389,7.5194,0.0009,0.0001,0.4811,0.1405,0.2501,1.3581,0.3608,6.999,3.9312,4.231,5.4712,2.6543,1.5659,1.13,4.2152,0.8077,1.1676,1.5521,6.5808,5.5913,3.2966,0.0069,3.671,0.8285,0.3101,0.9052,0.0142,0.004,0.9366,2.8959,1.5096,3.7886,0.6694,5.6478,2.0051,0.9825,3.0153,0.9702,6.0436,1.6307,2.7312,0.1167,2.81,1.5585,4.0557,4.2036,0.1517,6.1941,2.5965,6.1622,7.9075,7.0174,0.7928,0.5711,2.7992,4.2977,5.5377,0.4325,0.9944,11.8543,6.4287,0.0047,1.5812,1.9573,0.4945,0.2723,4.8458,1.0722,0.915,2.3194,0.0024,0.0077,4.5691,3.8474,7.0729,0.1881,1.9615,3.2398,2.9661,5.7258,4.0625,0.6371,4.7645,0.0124,0.0001,4.9794,4.3481,5.513,1.8153,2.8807,3.5243,0.0028,6.4594,0.2113,1.5615,2.9158,1.0591,0.5275,1.0911,2.3607,4.2207,4.8579,0.1295,4.4531,3.9094,0.7797,1.3088,2.2405,3.8309,1.26,0.9488,0.0183,0.5188,3.2859,1.7998,2.1494,3.463,0.18,3.3854,1.4627,5.3091,8.1289,1.8178,0.0631,2.352,5.567,1.9807,4.7707,0.0786,7.1682,3.8279,7.5253,3.3557,1.8148,5.4076,0.3587,1.1562,1.47,0.5468,0.4596,0.0309,2.9153,5.6987,7.3277,0.5667,1.0087,0.1856,1.1091,2.2539,4.4167,0.613,1.8689,2.818,0.6858,1.6334,3.0412,3.3811,1.1001,1.0693,4.2656,0.2832,1.8986,4.2465,1.8862,1.9682,1.606,0.4076,0.0311,0.1934,3.7642,3.0165,2.2951,3.0929,3.661,1.0839,5.9253,1.4544,3.3629,5.6919,5.751,0.2634,0.0258,4.8193,0.87,13.2305,15.5216,4.5838,7.581,10.7101,0.0973,1.2724,1.7615,2.566,4.3123,0.0349,2.397,0.1669,4.0231,3.5392,2.1198,0.0687,2.6568,3.3736,4.9249,8.8041,0.4694,0.0457,0.4451,2.2455,0.408,0.7073,0.0026,5.2825,0.5448,2.9717,0.9618,0.3393,1.1429,0.2248,4.4425,1.544,6.1819,0.4984,6.7127,0.866,1.5743,0.5382,0.0844,0.4784,0.9665,0.2824,0.4826,5.2602,1.2449,6.0718,7.0017,2.8852,1.909,2.191,0.2136,0.1959,3.6731,0.521,1.0688,0.6571,0.1102,1.3013,0.2334,0.8087,10.8916,4.6202,7.5884,3.3999,3.0466,0.4583,3.2988,1.18,1.0694,1.0575,0.0819,3.1433,7.6799,3.4848,3.4618,5.1484,2.9432,1.7221,5.1204,1.6537,4.9986,2.6525,4.3526,0.0195,0.0008,2.4006,1.2668,0.2161,4.0862,2.7973,8.295,3.7098,2.8174,1.7735,1.1743,1.2255]}

In 2003, an estimated 30% of people accessed the Internet via mobile phones, a figure that jumped to 60% in 2011. Many people who use fixed-line Internet connections (broadband and mobile) also now access wireless connectivity with tablets and mobile phones.\nThis has changed the expectations and use of digital services. Today\u2019s mobile Internet users expect to be able to access web content and information from the most commonly used digital devices, and in any place at any time. Most mobile devices now support 3G, 4G or LTE networks. Mobile devices with a fast processor and a large memory enable users to process complex, interactive web applications and services in an intuitive way.\nMobile commerce solutions have grown enormously in recent years and are now a viable choice for many companies that do not have an on-premise application to manage their customer experience. It is estimated that the number of mobile devices used in the next few years may rise as high as 2 billion by 2020, and more than 50% of the world\u2019s population will be mobile users.\nFor this reason, the design and development of web applications for mobile devices is a necessity.\nThe rise in popularity of tablets and mobile devices is leading to the development of increasingly powerful applications for the users of the Internet. For example, we estimate that the use of tablets on the Internet will reach approximately 8.2 billion by 2022, and the number of mobile users will reach 5.3 billion by 2025. As such, it is essential that companies adapt their online applications to all devices, even on mobile devices, to ensure that all their users use these applications easily and smoothly.\nThanks to its mobile optimization technology, we have been able to create a mobile shopping guide with over 50,000 of the latest and most relevant tablets from the market, from Apple to Amazon. Let\u2019s get into it. As we can see, even Apple is giving its weight through the iPhone to the tablet device, which is probably the most powerful tablet in the world. We can see the increase in importance of tablets in recent years, which can be explained by increasing sales figures and the development of a wide variety of powerful tablet devices.\nThe tablet, with a screen 10.1\u201d in size, made it possible to overcome the limitations of the iPad and the iPhone, which both had a minimum screen size of 9.7\u201d. Since tablets have the ability to use a lot of processes on mobile devices and are much more versatile than a smartphone, we can foresee that they will continue to gain relevance in the next few years, giving rise to the increase in the number of tablets, with the development of technologies such as 3D technology.","token_len":621,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2192,0.3207,0.021,5.1166,1.053,0.1905,8.2707,10.5024,2.5099,0.8948,1.6882,1.7088,0.2404,4.2567,3.7709,7.3898,0.367,1.8,1.5666,0.5192,0.4776,2.6178,1.2214,4.2482,2.2914,0.8737,3.1241,4.0387,0.1895,7.4294,0.0031,5.6384,1.7707,2.3758,3.8408,0.3517,0.4092,4.2777,2.2786,6.6425,0.0021,3.7804,4.0867,1.7846,4.5346,1.2711,6.3915,0.0007,5.1198,2.4737,0.0698,0.0064,0.4935,0.6975,14.3668,5.4634,1.8679,2.2666,1.2301,13.2657,6.2786,7.5617,1.4356,0.765,5.6563,0.9338,7.4338,6.2175,0.1034,1.7123,5.5136,0.7105,2.7393,4.733,0.1154,4.8259,2.8654,3.9055,2.2792,0.0245,4.3622,3.9836,0.5874,0.4406,3.3595,1.6976,1.2816,1.3879,3.5668,2.8619,0.3727,4.9175,0.2288,3.6043,0.0263,0.8076,2.3982,0.8631,6.0158,2.6279,4.0378,2.1321,8.3936,1.418,0.2317,2.8724,3.1084,4.6666,8.4212,0.205,3.5653,2.7235,0.9246,3.9274,4.558,2.7287,6.0551,7.2118,4.8582,5.598,0.9239,2.9128,0.3877,0.4281,2.2477,4.0691,3.5852,2.2108,0.7092,8.7906,2.3654,5.8818,0.1326,4.6572,2.5388,1.1816,3.6551,16.5488,8.0599,4.1444,1.996,2.8292,2.287,5.715,1.1834,2.2094,0.8061,0.0225,1.0472,4.9941,1.1942,2.2286,4.3922,2.2582,2.538,5.1629,5.0676,1.0676,4.8636,3.2461,1.6184,2.6485,4.5535,6.423,6.8913,4.5921,1.5439,0.0972,0.5957,4.914,2.2692,1.8201,3.0153,2.8184,4.7346,0.2288,1.7884,0.6838,0.0047,3.3882,2.3036,1.5889,0.9323,3.4265,2.1808,3.2856,2.9227,5.4681,3.4586,1.3198,2.256,3.1234,2.8698,5.496,2.8098,0.0771,6.3076,4.5132,2.9132,4.429,2.5617,3.6373,2.6818,4.2557,2.9618,3.3982,3.8847,2.0487,0.3886,1.1385,4.1525,7.3846,8.0714,2.3942,4.5141,3.751,0.8819,0.8647,0.0763,2.4999,1.7474,1.9171,3.6683,5.665,3.8834,0.1929,2.0122,4.1005,3.1656,3.8281,0.7324,1.5097,3.8822,5.0631,0.0635,2.0908,0.7421,6.3808,3.2452,2.6577,0.8854,4.6807,3.0605,0.2248,4.7556,0.4533,3.5762,0.0479,2.6931,1.8349,0.0066,1.2138,2.1846,3.4263,1.1782,0.9083,7.7315,3.9892,0.0731,4.441,4.28,3.9412,3.5933,0.0067,4.3347,0.7209,1.9499,0.9493,1.8948,1.4781,3.6513,0.5286,3.0332,0.7979,0.1028,1.9178,2.0764,7.6785,0.6562,0.2822,1.7583,1.1114,1.3638,1.6459,1.6324,1.7253,0.7489,4.3198,3.9684,0.2899,0.1038,2.1941,7.6836,1.3905,1.5868,0.0869,4.3092,1.1082,2.8519,0.3733,0.2746,1.673,3.3707,5.6877,1.0355,2.5414,2.2777,5.7883,1.4337,3.13,0.1617,5.8388,0.6853,1.2548,1.5325,1.978,5.4006,0.3287,2.1719,2.2029,0.1235,6.0156,2.4527,3.1012,1.3832,2.1395,6.5785,0.8392,3.0502,1.493,0.3277,3.9197,0.9689,0.0307,4.8522,8.199,0.1249,1.4722,3.8123,0.0283,1.4529,5.2619,1.3388,0.706,1.7576,2.2001,4.5549,4.1253,1.3591,2.5711,0.152,0.8863,4.2186,1.2684,1.1787,1.9514,1.4076,0.0412,1.8345,3.3489,0.7241,1.9712,4.1072,0.6388,2.2101,0.0143,0.0773,2.3305,0.2035,4.3284,4.0278,0.0242,3.2179,0.2838,4.2592,0.3676,5.0999,5.4143,1.0978,4.7888,2.5676,0.4479,6.7496,3.7412,1.6849,4.6602,4.6635,1.4293,0.5469,1.7607,1.9744,2.2619,0.5837,3.556,3.8558,1.0485,3.9765,4.2311,1.0052,5.9867,0.9763,4.428,0.1981,0.4567,7.7598,0.0683,4.5587,4.4392,7.9539,3.2364,0.1958,3.4585,1.5293,2.7579,0.0331,0.006,3.1661,1.7043,3.0807,5.0092,7.3596,3.2387,2.3824,3.002,1.2744,0.0032,5.6464,0.4957,3.9548,2.3231,2.4302,4.3011,7.482,4.7449,2.3937,4.7644,1.9786,4.4817,4.5036,2.2222,2.588,1.0414,8.0273,9.7547,1.0542,0.2444,5.4088,4.1996,2.2835,0.9342,5.8498,2.1265,4.0299,0.3093,0.6137,5.2719,4.3032,2.5264,5.4987,2.5252,11.0473,8.2818,1.9907,4.0563,5.3824,1.6376,3.1124,6.4573,2.3902,1.816,1.1648,6.1164,0.8402,0.5607,3.0152,1.5205,1.8799,0.269,0.4546,0.551,3.8688,1.7517,1.4622,2.7258,5.834,0.3203,6.7311,0.6526,2.5489,1.2041,4.7085,0.1823,1.7275,3.3529,3.5714,0.4359,3.2187,0.3531,5.5064,4.7597,6.6885,2.1517,1.7188,4.7571,0.0962,3.054,3.8301,1.237,0.0025,6.2681,3.4666,1.8444,0.664,0.5643,2.1074,3.7999,4.6832,3.9638,4.0734,4.0868,7.968,1.4455,2.8746,5.7455,6.3841,5.7298,0.2978,0.5111,7.1551,2.2256,1.9945,0.4892,8.3761,0.8218,1.2569,0.218,1.2752,3.8979,1.4947,2.0778,1.5299,1.9437,1.673,5.6306,2.224,1.8492,6.7059,1.7189,0.2273,0.0664,3.8359,0.2105,2.3372,0.2874,0.0275,0.6457,4.5784,4.2015,2.0251,3.1502,2.0561,0.0183,4.0577,2.5592,2.7399,0.105,9.802,3.5093,4.1222,0.233,3.0159,3.3072,3.9926,0.8554,3.4186,1.0433,3.9374,1.6279,0.2861,2.2898,1.0062,5.3259,1.6712,3.1023,0.3565,2.5537,0.0367,3.7091,4.8398,1.4545,0.4061,2.8589,0.7626,0.0774,2.7576,6.1317,2.29,0.0183,2.1463,6.6882,0.1586,1.5758,0.8096,0.0363,1.7111,3.1028,4.3708,1.4518,4.2182,0.1038,6.7052,2.1231,0.0059,3.4985,0.1655,5.2981,1.8048]}
{"prompt":"The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States , challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era , according to","text":"The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era, according to a new report.\nTrump administration rejects U.S. citizens in EU, Russia, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia or Mexico passport photo is now an oval\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security is restricting passports where the oval portrait photograph, where people stand from head to toe next to a small landscape background, is taken.\nThe new photo was ordered by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office in 2017 and became mandatory for all foreigners, including citizens of the United States.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s new rules say the \u201cnew passport photo, which is an oval portrait, requires the person in the photo to stand with their feet together and shoulders squared against the background.\u201d\nThe rule exempts American passport holders. For travelers from other countries, the new photo is being added to a list of the 10 required passport picture formats.\n\u201cThe purpose of these rules is to help the United States and the governments abroad we work with maintain the security of our travelers\u2019 passports,\u201d an acting assistant secretary for information and technology at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told reporters.\nPassports issued by foreign governments must comply with United States regulations on photo requirements.\nThe restrictions came after President Trump ordered in 2017 that U.S. citizens be issued an image of their passports. This was followed within 15 days by a government announcement ordering officials across the U.S. to start taking those new images.\nBy late 2018, the new standard was applied just as the Trump administration was planning another round of immigration crackdowns, which led to the loss of DACA, then in limbo as the Trump administration took no action on the extension the previous week.\n\u201cSome travelers may take a new passport photo but their country of residence is not yet applying the changes to passports,\u201d the federal agency wrote.\nWhile this new photo requirement is still on hold in many countries, it has already resulted in new passports being rejected by the embassy in Washington, according to a reporter who has seen the new photos in the mail.\nOfficial documents and images of the new photo from multiple posts in the U.S. embassy in Mexico confirm that some passports for U.S. citizens have been declined by the embassy for being \u201cinconsistent with established policy\u201d on the kind of new photo.\n\u201cWhile this type of inconsistency may have been noticed before, U.S. passport holders\u2019 countries of residence are now required to

{"prompt":"Pakistan allowed the wife and mother of an Indian man convicted of spying to visit him on Monday in Islamabad , eight months after he was sentenced to death by a military court . Kulbhushan","text":"Pakistan allowed the wife and mother of an Indian man convicted of spying to visit him on Monday in Islamabad, eight months after he was sentenced to death by a military court. Kulbhushan Jadhav, a university professor, was sentenced to death by the military court in June on spying charges in Delhi, where he lived with his family since his arrest following his return to India in January. On Monday, the Indian Embassy in Pakistan released an Indian passport for Jadhav's wife, whom the woman had not seen since May. The woman can visit Jadhav at least five times, once a month during a 30-day period. \"We are thrilled that our son is back with his family. This day has been long awaited by us,\" said Shikha, the mother of Jadhav.\nThe World Bank and the Federal Government are in agreement on the need to reduce the country's high youth unemployment. The World Bank has given Nigeria a soft loan of approximately $200 million against a $4 billion loan from the Paris Club to pay down its mounting foreign debt. It should be noted that Nigerian youths are the driving force behind the development of Nigeria. It is important therefore to give them a head start as a result of which there are indications that the government is giving due attention to the youth sector in the ongoing Nigeria Labour Relations Commission (NLRC) reforms among other sectors.\nThere is a sense in which it is imperative that the World Bank take a leading role in the quest to reduce Nigeria's unemployment. It can be recalled that the Bank had set up a $200 million soft loan to help Nigeria reduce its high youth unemployment by helping young people enter the job market, by improving access to education and vocational training, and through entrepreneurship development. As to the recent NLRC reforms, there is a need to ensure that there are fair and equitable mechanisms in the implementation thereof. The reforms were originally targeted towards the industrial associations, and it is therefore important to ensure that there is an approach that can promote the free and fair representation of employees.\nIt is therefore important to recall that in a just society, there is no place for monopolies as such a system can never ensure fairness and equity in labour practices. It is important to appreciate that there is a need to ensure that the existing system in the NLRC which has been in operation for long enough is not made obsolete and instead, it should be made functional and relevant to the current realities in Nigeria.\nIt is also important to recall that Nigeria had set a target of reducing unemployment by 100,000 at the peak of the recession in the early 1990s because of the rising cost of living and other factors. At that time, there was a massive unemployment challenge because most of the businesses were based on labour, and as a result, it was never possible for the government to increase the minimum wage because employers would be reluctant to do so because it would affect them negatively. As at the time, the minimum allowable wage was less than two dollars. As a result, the problem of unemployment began to grow.

{"prompt":"Burundi s main opposition grouping said it is boycotting peace talks that resumed on Tuesday in Tanzania , leaving little chance that the negotiations will end simmering political violence that has claimed hundreds of lives","text":"Burundi s main opposition grouping said it is boycotting peace talks that resumed on Tuesday in Tanzania, leaving little chance that the negotiations will end simmering political violence that has claimed hundreds of lives.\nPolitical observers and diplomats said that the resumption of the talks, which were cancelled earlier in the day after the Burundian army allegedly killed dozens of opposition fighters and refugees in the Central African Republic, did not represent a breakthrough.\nBurundi's opposition and rebel groups, who have been at peace talks with the Government for more than five years and whose unity remains tenuous, met to seek a united stance.\nThey said they would continue pressing the Government to bring political violence to an end and asked Tanzania to call a truce until elections are held, their current priority.\n\"We're coming to the talks without the support of the opposition, not a single one of us is sitting here to meet that request,\" said Ms Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Sebudandi, speaking for the opposition umbrella group for the Cndd-Fdd party - the official ruling party.\nBurundi, with Africa's largest slums and the poorest economy, is a fragile little state in the middle of a major crisis. More than 1,000 people have died since rebel groups attacked Bujumbura in March after President Nkurunziza declared his bid to go it alone for a third term.\nMany observers were struck that the Government and the rebels that have fought for decades, said their representatives, were not there.\n\"What does that show? Does it mean that they've decided to be reconciled? No, what they want is a political solution,\" said one observer.\n\"The main thing they care about is getting rid of the Burundian army and putting them on ice in order that they can get rid of President Nkurunziza one day.\"\nBujumbura has rejected any talk of an amnesty for rebels since their violence broke out, claiming that even those whose crimes are not immediately apparent carry the baggage of decades of misrule and corruption by President Nkurunziza, who has ruled for an unprecedented 15 years.\nMr Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, secretary-general of the main opposition umbrella group, said the violence would stop only when \"our martyrs are returned\". The National Council of Resistance of Burundi (CNRR) is a grouping made up of rebels who have fought the Government.\nMs Sebudandi said their representatives had been held hostage, but that the rebels were in their right to express their grief.\n\"The Burundian army doesn't know respect,\" she said. \"We are human beings who have the right to mourn the loss of a son or a daughter.\"\nIt is not clear who has been responsible for the deaths but the rebel groups that carried out the attacks denied any involvement.\nRebel leader Prince Emmanuel Ntete said the attacks came after Burundian soldiers killed hundreds of refugees near their camps on Tuesday in the Central African Republic.","token_len":622,"entropy":[8.4957,0.9694,9.2824,8.9451,4.2956,6.1999,4.4395,1.9837,3.2637,6.9236,0.0033,8.8204,0.0645,4.0815,6.8115,1.5443,2.3341,3.0281,5.8079,2.1172,6.4875,5.7452,2.0201,3.5209,1.1977,4.0641,0.8958,2.992,13.46,0.0007,6.5861,1.9546,2.9647,0.4542,3.0312,3.1833,0.0695,0.0283,0.8223,0.2053,24.8141,3.6458,3.7536,3.0254,1.099,2.4787,1.624,6.5984,0.0148,0.0813,2.1192,0.5215,2.2182,0.8809,2.9603,6.3791,3.2707,2.1335,0.1249,0.5841,2.3952,1.9916,7.9148,0.0319,2.7511,2.395,6.0548,3.0391,3.6467,0.0916,1.97,3.1411,2.4956,6.8151,1.7953,1.6658,6.8507,0.0654,0.0123,0.3026,5.5005,0.1918,3.9965,0.7199,3.061,1.7432,0.2149,7.3324,0.0131,0.3965,0.9362,3.1422,4.2803,5.5326,1.269,2.9459,2.4256,1.1767,1.65,4.0377,6.1497,2.5867,2.7377,0.6933,6.8366,3.4597,1.5186,0.0012,3.3308,0.1808,3.8901,4.31,6.1543,5.3575,7.4592,0.0413,0.7409,5.3318,3.6688,4.5765,1.2434,6.4081,4.5792,2.0865,0.3646,4.4889,2.4071,1.4658,1.6515,2.3417,6.2491,2.0393,2.8873,0.6071,4.1362,4.6741,5.7814,0.4406,0.2645,0.0034,1.5496,5.5869,8.3715,0.9147,6.3683,1.786,3.4635,5.1122,5.1597,1.2146,0.0697,3.3482,6.0973,7.3938,7.2923,0.2299,0.2188,1.8799,1.2415,3.9713,5.9225,1.292,1.6947,6.5814,4.591,2.8935,3.2234,0.0969,0.6073,2.1327,1.875,4.1313,5.4559,2.0379,2.6479,0.4323,1.4105,1.7759,5.6999,1.6633,5.1415,5.4183,5.1381,4.4259,0.2432,0.4438,7.1997,5.1919,8.1659,0.0439,0.0059,10.3239,5.9224,9.7609,0.274,6.2837,3.8126,0.5896,0.9685,8.1558,0.7923,4.5546,1.2687,7.5214,9.1969,4.6603,4.0716,3.9444,7.2238,4.493,6.5045,1.1605,5.6541,5.6262,0.4332,1.8965,0.1731,4.1812,0.0401,0.381,3.7497,3.4468,6.4663,0.1363,1.7033,7.5129,5.6095,1.2118,2.1852,2.6868,4.2323,0.3394,1.2584,2.4536,5.1746,6.5312,3.9795,3.2109,2.1209,2.8474,0.1662,0.6576,4.4409,4.802,1.216,5.9387,0.0247,2.6481,0.9815,1.0012,0.6621,0.4504,1.0709,1.0231,5.3376,1.8672,3.6096,10.9049,2.6184,0.575,0.0205,1.3909,2.1205,4.2109,4.5941,5.4906,1.1084,1.0215,0.007,0.0013,0.001,2.8235,3.743,7.2792,1.2483,6.3108,5.9435,0.147,2.9634,1.8678,2.3074,0.4225,0.6066,0.3436,5.2493,3.993,4.6946,6.7679,5.1985,0.9901,4.0772,3.7237,1.6802,2.8778,6.7969,2.1555,3.8864,1.3885,3.1001,4.0029,7.0311,4.1777,5.6994,1.8458,1.6349,2.4733,6.4875,3.8051,0.4773,1.0236,3.7413,4.2663,2.2953,4.9,1.2194,4.8429,0.6773,1.452,0.8897,1.8386,3.9299,3.8023,0.5381,5.1509,7.8365,0.0543,1.806,2.2261,1.1089,4.3523,2.3131,3.7066,0.5936,2.3446,2.2332,1.6503,1.4309,0.2145,3.6719,2.1159,0.7244,0.3277,2.7636,2.1863,4.0794,2.4543,2.2873,6.4958,0.0965,0.196,3.5779,2.4487,0.0052,0.6906,3.1342,0.0039,1.4957,1.2638,1.325,4.2433,2.7238,2.4484,8.0903,3.575,2.823,5.0782,0.5438,0.4067,2.9752,1.9695,0.0163,5.1332,0.3742,0.0125,0.0049,0.0009,0.0021,0.0077,7.3296,1.1282,2.162,0.1748,5.1025,2.777,0.004,0.0045,2.2287,8.2636,2.5139,6.0204,0.0607,3.2352,4.0764,1.0239,2.557,4.8906,4.6186,5.248,2.9745,0.0023,2.6702,4.974,1.2138,6.1478,4.8387,5.6748,5.3157,1.7907,2.3372,4.5823,5.1256,6.8581,1.758,5.2509,0.0777,4.1516,0.2146,6.4162,0.2259,2.045,2.2967,6.4615,5.395,0.6391,0.0226,0.0051,0.0013,0.0069,0.0131,2.9131,0.7975,1.5272,3.384,1.5571,6.2028,4.424,3.3597,0.1426,0.259,0.2351,4.0941,10.7537,1.0927,2.376,6.6174,4.4476,6.5852,7.0707,5.0126,5.8214,5.7462,0.2436,6.3047,1.2831,0.0052,0.0951,0.2089,5.2163,0.1899,7.7063,0.4089,0.9821,1.016,1.3932,5.1326,3.0051,5.4613,3.5008,1.6003,4.0522,5.5631,9.4028,0.1469,1.0721,4.4225,1.9221,3.9703,5.118,3.3173,0.6877,2.3508,3.4674,1.7337,0.0005,0.1174,2.5923,4.237,4.87,1.0001,3.7536,3.2557,5.2053,6.7372,0.0018,0.3463,4.2219,2.7321,1.3881,2.3337,2.7613,3.3594,4.3456,0.2881,5.8526,3.4536,0.0027,0.0015,0.3818,5.9293,3.7905,1.6901,2.1224,4.8095,1.9791,3.3835,1.8449,1.7017,1.7353,4.138,1.5018,3.9378,3.6042,3.5059,1.7145,5.1109,0.1842,5.8492,0.7908,0.3868,0.5929,2.1536,4.6623,0.0014,0.4152,1.6152,4.7543,0.0003,3.696,10.499,3.9338,0.1935,0.1052,0.2789,0.6754,2.024,2.0972,5.7036,0.5388,2.4092,1.3937,5.0895,0.3946,0.0396,4.9669,3.1853,1.1237,0.045,3.2396,5.4177,2.1648,1.5053,0.8791,1.8527,0.2614,5.0681,1.2042,1.5511,0.5794,2.8645,2.856,1.106,2.5472,0.174,0.2821,4.1029,4.6803,1.6435,5.3911,1.7176,3.4141,4.8459,0.0903,0.2118,2.047,6.7807,1.4384,1.1453,0.5819,0.5567,6.022,1.0315,3.3621,7.0648,8.4335,2.8448,4.407,5.7687,1.322,1.314,3.1873,4.8209,1.7634,4.5793,0.0031,0.6634,2.2106,3.2377,3.7885,0.1351,6.0204,5.2125,4.2639,3.8205,2.618,1.5755,2.8002,1.3528,1.0397,0.022,0.0015,0.5885]}

of the rightwing opposition party that rules Congress","text":"Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said on Thursday that authorities leading an expanding graft investigation into Brazilian builder Odebrecht had gone too far by raiding the offices of the rightwing opposition party that rules Congress.\nMr Kuczynski, who has been hit by three indictments for campaigning donations from Odebrecht and also faces lawsuits for corruption, called the operations conducted by the Brazilian and Peruvian prosecutors \u201cvery unfriendly.\u201d\n\u201cI think it (the raids) go too far, even in the case of a Peruvian court,\u201d he said during a lunchtime press conference at a country house near Lima.\nForeign investors welled up to buy Spanish shares on Thursday following a speech by a hawkish central banker, with investors hoping that Spain will soon face a sharp reversal in its current recession and begin to feel a gradual shift in its austerity policies.\nSpain\u2019s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos called for a greater \u201cleverage\u201d between economic activity and public spending, while promising a shift to \u201cmore flexible spending rules\u201d, saying he would aim for an annual deficit of the maximum of 0.5 or 1.0 per cent of GDP.\nThe euro zone\u2019s third largest economy shrank 0.9 per cent in the third quarter, bringing the six-month period\u2019s growth to 1.3 per cent on the back of recovery in the service sector.\nSpain\u2019s GDP contracted 3.1 per cent between April and June, much worse than the 1.9 per cent decline forecast.\nBut the economy shrank much more quickly in the first three months of the year, down 1.7 per cent, when many measures to bolster the job market were introduced.\nThe minister also said that the government would take a tougher stance against illegal immigrants on Friday, with a new law being proposed to make it harder for immigrants to secure residency permits.\nThe government was also set to announce measures to promote the creation of businesses by unemployed persons, with the minister saying a law establishing a \u201cpre-employment allowance\u201d would be proposed as part of a package of measures.\nBritain\u2019s currency and exchange rates were set for a mixed start to the London session that saw sterling trade at 1.8200 per euro after gaining in early trading but eventually pulling back as investors prepared for the start of the U.K.\u2019s financial year.\nThe pound has risen to record highs against the euro this month, but has also struggled as hopes of positive economic data have receded.\nAnalysts told the Daily Telegraph that sterling\u2019s recent gains and strong demand for a rate cut were a cause for concern, with the rise being more about a rebound from lows due to

He is expected to hold talks with","text":"Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami plans to visit Russia soon, the RIA news agency reported on Friday, citing a source at the Iranian defense ministry. He is expected to hold talks with Russian defense and military officials and to sign a number of documents.\nOne of the documents, according to the state news agency, will confirm joint Russian-Iranian defense development projects, which will include military systems such as antiaircraft, anti-tank, missile, radar, communications, and space equipment as well as weapons training cooperation. There will also be discussions on the Iranian nuclear program, nuclear tests, missile defense, and other military and security issues and their solution. Putin\nMoscow plans to strengthen its military cooperation with Iran at a time when Tehran is reorienting its regional agenda, according to the vice head of Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, General Valery Gerasimov.\n\u201cWe see in Tehran a certain desire to use the military power of Russia, it is possible that they will seek help in this area,\u201d he told a news conference on Friday. At the same time, General Gerasimov cautioned that the Russia\u2019s relations with Iran would be mainly diplomatic and economic, and this will help make Moscow a more powerful and influential player on the international scene. He stressed that Russia is not intending to turn against Iran in any way.\nTensions with the U.S. have increased in recent years after the Islamic republic announced its decision to develop more powerful nuclear energy. Since 2009, the U.S. President\u2019s nuclear weapons have been banned from Iran, which, along with Israel and Pakistan, is one of the few countries to possess nuclear weapons. Putin expressed concern about Israel\u2019s missile technology, which he said has made some progress in recent years.\nRussian Vice Minister of Defence Sergei surkov said that his countrys' nuclear program has been completely secure.\nOn May 29th there was an announcement that a nuclear program of Russia has been completed and that it has finished the construction of the first facility of the new site named after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin \u201c. The new facility can build a new reactor and produce enriched uranium with an enrichment level of up to 40%.\nFor comparison, a nuclear reactor, it is necessary to enrich uranium with a content of 3%, although some countries increase the content of uranium by two to three percent.\nThis is exactly how nuclear reactors used to enrich uranium in the Soviet Union and is due to these enrichment facilities and other components, Russia will produce the new warheads for its ballistic missiles.\nA significant component of nuclear weapons is enriched uranium, and Russia has already started enrichment facilities of the new site.\nThis is an important news from the Russian government when on May 20th, the Russian parliament passed amendments to the foreign policy treaty of the country. At the same time, the deal states that the nuclear weapons that were banned from Iran due to the American sanctions will be replaced with new missiles that, according to Russia, are able to provide ballistic attacks on targets both in Iran and its neighbor countries.","token_len":623,"entropy":[6.9161,6.1618,0.5539,7.2755,8.2394,2.7857,8.2513,0.0878,2.2907,4.0186,3.6619,1.4362,2.6832,7.1684,0.0704,0.7802,0.0059,0.3956,1.1649,1.8133,1.9121,0.6574,1.3994,1.458,3.9749,0.2741,3.7584,3.317,0.0263,0.1263,4.6164,1.726,1.3191,0.0238,3.8491,0.7554,0.1471,1.4544,3.9421,4.309,1.9816,0.2713,3.364,3.58,4.6103,0.6464,7.0712,0.0006,3.6542,2.074,0.2965,18.0686,0.503,0.3916,1.1433,1.4311,4.7505,0.0005,0.464,4.9519,1.907,0.0319,0.499,3.8858,5.3,9.7678,2.4765,0.6223,0.2246,0.0043,3.7628,5.7707,2.7765,1.7652,1.7637,2.1876,1.9341,4.41,4.7127,3.1728,0.0012,7.4321,0.1994,0.0001,3.2201,1.8804,0.0064,1.4691,1.7949,2.8879,1.7073,3.5108,0.9839,3.2094,1.0615,1.3214,5.1908,4.5906,5.3231,0.0941,0.0053,4.4921,4.9233,8.3497,0.6136,6.5269,1.3812,0.1437,0.0204,4.2213,1.2602,1.9036,5.2546,2.0326,0.3298,0.9453,7.5956,6.3877,0.41,3.9184,1.908,0.6951,0.6114,2.6033,3.1123,3.0067,2.0411,0.3391,5.3585,6.7364,6.1734,0.8264,8.414,8.4013,5.5249,5.7287,0.1061,3.7428,1.1982,1.6983,2.6266,0.1807,0.9781,4.2765,1.2802,1.0693,0.2489,2.2877,0.5662,6.1481,4.749,0.0236,0.367,4.9276,4.8598,1.8424,2.4068,0.0023,1.4583,8.3438,4.9587,0.0115,3.09,16.2056,7.4042,3.153,3.4085,0.1434,1.0996,2.8567,5.4805,0.0771,0.4814,0.124,0.0065,0.3661,0.7112,7.8859,5.3117,7.7165,4.5361,4.2455,4.9894,1.9543,6.2998,5.3187,0.3821,5.3877,1.9317,3.3267,2.8949,0.6535,2.2224,2.3638,5.1995,1.0795,3.6913,1.0183,2.882,0.6864,4.2211,6.0249,2.1897,2.0483,1.6492,1.8537,6.3149,7.278,1.7714,1.2305,2.9331,1.0059,0.2842,1.5069,0.9899,0.2313,6.5874,0.4399,0.0961,0.0252,0.0923,5.6913,0.1539,0.0003,0.0003,5.8083,0.5595,1.7235,5.5767,5.1595,0.5663,0.0059,5.4951,0.2414,0.7767,3.0576,1.1959,8.1527,8.2365,1.2861,4.1591,1.4003,1.4645,5.5883,2.8784,4.0066,4.9138,3.6415,3.1916,1.0051,4.2005,2.859,3.8472,1.6752,3.587,0.1578,0.8712,2.6011,0.3902,3.8946,3.2167,0.1511,1.3964,2.3153,1.704,6.5953,0.1254,4.4236,4.1239,0.569,3.2009,1.0935,0.4504,1.012,0.5157,5.8797,1.0435,2.6485,2.4439,2.9823,0.0021,0.0061,0.2149,2.6073,2.505,1.5421,0.0895,2.0138,2.8236,1.1202,4.4315,2.252,4.8387,1.7735,4.1558,0.141,4.7824,5.9979,4.6894,1.1159,4.2183,1.6801,4.4544,3.7397,0.0842,1.4033,1.2831,0.0006,0.0027,0.2841,6.9677,11.6739,0.3322,0.0105,2.2349,3.5351,3.6455,0.6581,4.637,2.9962,3.3571,1.2514,3.5415,5.0956,2.1421,0.0003,3.7133,1.5551,5.0811,0.0624,1.8457,2.6243,0.013,0.1712,3.263,0.8644,3.0551,3.3637,1.2559,0.2999,0.2707,6.3456,5.3526,1.8189,1.3925,6.216,3.6237,0.0168,0.0167,5.7372,5.9363,1.5511,1.8076,1.8299,0.8228,2.9764,3.8213,5.5978,2.4437,1.1305,1.3973,0.1049,0.6014,0.5811,4.22,6.2179,2.9747,0.4951,2.4371,1.9644,23.8438,5.3879,1.4903,1.8102,4.5022,0.2081,10.6529,9.1496,2.7618,2.0864,2.2719,1.131,5.8531,6.6242,1.7095,1.3601,4.4204,4.5257,3.4562,4.066,7.7416,0.6457,1.655,3.4066,1.7082,3.3617,3.5146,4.7624,2.7012,2.4375,4.1499,0.1957,3.1516,2.4829,1.5218,1.8739,2.6625,5.8112,2.8787,2.2297,0.3414,1.8257,2.1231,5.2077,2.3435,1.3409,2.9384,7.0259,6.7504,3.0261,3.882,3.7177,0.0838,5.1871,5.9885,2.7126,2.3395,1.9351,2.675,1.3333,6.4303,5.8295,2.1378,2.3518,2.9175,1.955,4.1593,5.4663,0.0456,4.7469,2.7554,3.4802,4.0607,0.3079,3.2845,0.0025,4.2254,3.1594,1.1461,5.166,4.8178,0.1618,3.1652,2.4598,1.1442,4.6401,6.0598,0.756,4.1802,0.2862,4.6593,1.0018,1.6257,1.686,7.3035,0.3335,3.7868,4.0978,6.386,4.1354,2.2264,6.4687,1.188,3.7534,0.9281,1.4019,2.369,5.2537,1.4936,0.8595,1.6999,0.8341,1.2943,4.2562,1.8039,6.2824,2.9905,4.7712,2.7177,6.8034,0.0664,5.9246,0.3053,2.4069,0.4857,1.8527,0.1013,2.672,5.3412,5.8853,0.067,9.6205,4.696,2.3734,4.8142,2.1431,5.8417,2.3572,3.3706,4.4062,5.1694,3.6817,3.5673,8.692,2.0947,1.259,3.7229,0.9413,0.9929,0.7989,4.0568,5.9209,5.2142,0.3014,4.2821,1.9438,1.5497,4.1836,0.0263,0.9657,2.9111,3.2802,1.5311,2.6824,2.5063,6.1346,4.4763,3.5819,2.3633,3.194,4.2976,1.2156,1.0329,3.9489,1.3976,3.345,0.5636,6.1738,4.8086,1.0132,1.7605,2.9781,6.1752,7.4977,1.0397,4.0206,0.3432,1.3449,1.8154,1.6319,2.9701,1.8436,6.3326,0.6013,0.2842,6.9506,1.6722,4.5831,2.7402,0.9399,4.825,1.9125,5.194,0.4735,0.6021,0.0061,0.1903,1.194,6.5792,4.9715,0.1124,1.4041,4.1803,1.783,4.0805,3.0506,4.7028,0.9461,0.8679,8.2783,0.0026,1.4036,7.0789,2.5613,1.9684,0.5258,3.4343,0.9313,2.0549,5.3843,2.1867,5.2235,2.2329,0.0022,2.7036,0.3467,1.9474,3.8496,0.0009,4.7041,5.4605,7.1315,2.6263,3.0317,6.1107,1.6065,3.6526,0.0394,4.2918,2.1518,2.7042,0.5477]}
{"prompt":"Russia and Egypt may sign an agreement on Friday allowing to resume Russian civilian flights to Egypt , the TASS news agency cited Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov as saying on Thursday . Egypt s","text":"Russia and Egypt may sign an agreement on Friday allowing to resume Russian civilian flights to Egypt, the TASS news agency cited Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov as saying on Thursday. Egypt s President Hosni Mubarak will attend the ceremony.Sokolov said the Egyptians were not interested in a return for the airlines Egypt Air and Egypt Helwan Airways of the carrier that is a subsidiary of Lufthansa. But in a surprise move, the Egyptians offered to give these airlines their former license in return for the continuation of flights to Egypt, Sokolov said.In April, Egypt Air announced that it wanted to leave Lufthansa. It was speculated that the carrier s management would go public when they announced the airline s new name after the privatization of the company. However, Lufthansa s parent company, Deutsche Lufthansa (DL), did not want to sell the company s whole 51% stake in Egypt Air because it was the carrier that was responsible for flying German tourists and Germans in the countries where it operated. That is why the share of Lufthansa in Egypt Air became 49% in 2010.Sokolov said that Egypt s airlines would be allowed to fly only to nine cities in Egypt and not to Alexandria and Luxor.The number of flights to Israel has been also mentioned but Sokolov said that Moscow would not consider this issue as problematic.Sokolov said that Russia s main problem in this area was that its citizens faced difficulties in booking flights that were not offered by the Russian airlines for the destinations on the map of the flights to Egypt. He said that this was the main reason why Egypt would not allow to establish new flights in Russia by the Russian airlines. In Egypt, flights to 10 cities in Egypt were scheduled by the Russian airlines. The flights were cancelled several times since they were launched in May, 2011, due to the war in Syria.The first flight between Moscow and Cairo was launched on June 26. The flights have already started, since the first flight from Moscow to Alexandria was held on July 13. Egypt has not announced the schedule of the flights during the war in Syria.Sokolov said that the most important problem which he wanted to clarify with Egypt s government was the fact that the two governments agreed to start new international flights. The Russian government would try to convince Egypt s government to continue the flights to Russia with the Russian airlines. Sokolov added that the Russian side also asked the Egyptian side that it should not impose its interests by the Russian airlines in Egypt. On the other hand the Russian airline should not be afraid of the competition with the airlines.Sokolov said that the government of Egypt has agreed to continue the flights to Russia with the Russian airlines but it would not allow to take off from its airports. The Russian government has also offered to the governments of other countries to agree with Egypt to resume flights with the flights.Sokolov also said that Egypt is not only interested in the flights from Russia to Egypt but also in the flights to cities in Egypt.","token_len":624,"entropy":[3.4031,5.2458,5.4608,6.0977,1.9005,0.5594,1.3322,3.6941,5.5894,5.2379,4.1489,7.5046,8.6087,2.0017,1.1925,1.7075,1.4492,2.089,7.2728,0.1171,0.076,0.0383,4.9198,3.1355,8.5201,0.1597,5.0584,2.3667,0.0553,0.0539,0.1028,0.0523,2.2984,2.1428,0.079,6.7792,11.1565,5.4321,3.7436,0.0001,0.0003,3.7746,2.6609,0.6509,3.5641,1.161,6.8984,0.1425,0.0012,0.0027,1.0907,1.4734,7.5155,2.593,3.3217,2.8224,0.0234,2.2898,2.7882,5.376,1.9029,7.1248,9.4256,3.0247,0.8961,1.533,9.1682,8.7661,4.0903,6.3556,2.1734,7.5043,5.6459,3.2027,3.96,2.0622,0.0455,6.6599,0.0412,0.0002,0.0,0.0,0.944,5.3247,4.5323,1.1474,6.2497,0.5803,0.3077,1.3474,4.8863,5.1265,0.7978,4.2037,7.527,1.6259,3.2116,7.3382,6.58,3.3626,1.1419,0.2444,1.9522,5.5672,0.0679,1.1029,0.9754,0.4997,1.9023,0.3762,0.0007,0.0014,0.2658,0.4072,4.0036,4.4405,0.4388,1.8184,3.7563,2.6155,1.0405,0.4637,5.4491,0.2444,5.4762,4.51,0.0001,0.0092,0.0136,0.0003,2.8024,2.8266,2.5044,9.4135,0.1919,1.1333,4.4735,10.499,6.7654,1.3697,4.839,4.0695,5.946,3.3127,4.4355,1.0457,4.8051,4.1603,5.0516,4.6128,4.1956,1.4116,7.3574,0.7943,1.3547,2.9945,1.4711,3.5861,0.0462,2.9526,0.0009,0.0031,0.0083,0.0007,4.1123,5.5275,0.6062,1.2971,7.9516,3.5924,0.0499,0.0844,0.0448,0.003,4.5652,1.5387,3.7398,2.6125,0.0315,4.2235,0.2532,3.9773,1.1824,1.6234,5.8391,7.0955,8.7048,1.038,0.2059,0.6083,1.1368,0.8118,4.721,1.3769,1.5203,4.2845,5.4118,2.2038,1.7034,4.2342,0.0216,5.3219,7.5035,3.8266,2.9554,6.4817,2.3089,1.1391,5.9647,2.3838,2.4201,1.5219,0.5168,5.7294,2.9078,1.0268,1.3079,8.0992,1.5185,1.6743,0.0004,0.0023,0.006,0.0008,3.6382,1.1435,0.2829,5.4602,5.5474,1.0282,1.1489,3.9015,0.8756,4.0035,0.0683,0.0012,0.0026,0.6433,1.2181,2.6457,7.1382,5.5095,2.039,2.096,1.8405,0.1466,1.6227,4.0653,2.0994,9.5087,4.1938,1.0144,0.9662,2.0636,3.8057,0.5753,7.519,2.549,6.2759,0.001,0.8307,3.8599,6.1465,0.1066,1.5565,1.4002,5.2381,2.8272,1.736,7.0693,6.2684,4.049,2.6932,0.0006,0.0013,0.6361,1.0458,6.1514,1.8991,0.5843,4.1523,3.3316,4.9103,3.0365,8.2407,0.8025,2.5862,0.0682,0.0012,0.0014,0.5996,0.3726,2.8396,3.0236,4.7367,3.8669,2.2679,3.7759,2.7391,1.6121,1.4713,3.5051,4.728,7.2323,3.9927,1.4826,8.0147,0.4578,5.0025,1.2455,1.6151,4.3979,1.3923,1.7964,2.824,1.0653,5.799,2.2187,6.353,4.2636,1.6669,5.9669,2.5361,1.1643,6.0404,2.6416,2.1851,0.5037,2.0084,0.6918,0.2807,2.7463,1.314,2.67,1.8246,0.4305,0.5557,2.7307,4.6751,0.8574,1.8307,3.2503,7.7177,3.9559,1.5744,3.038,3.0213,4.721,1.7447,1.3762,0.3794,0.8478,4.6515,4.6612,0.8499,4.5077,1.018,9.7483,2.0061,1.9282,0.9539,1.9457,4.8756,2.379,1.723,0.724,0.5781,2.4697,2.7742,3.3025,1.7709,4.2648,6.2145,0.3201,5.388,2.6424,0.7111,6.5345,1.4348,4.0235,2.8382,7.2172,1.5555,5.8239,0.0062,1.7885,6.0412,0.7715,0.4584,0.8378,2.5748,4.5867,1.5303,4.9093,1.9545,0.0531,0.6514,1.0947,4.9323,1.1542,2.3456,3.6308,2.4642,1.3488,3.646,4.6766,3.7745,2.2015,3.0743,5.9292,1.3668,2.69,1.1479,2.5131,0.7695,0.3094,4.1648,1.0707,3.9385,0.5393,1.2173,3.6949,0.4793,4.5527,4.1994,3.1948,3.7768,2.2352,5.2603,0.8767,1.377,0.5942,6.4778,0.7117,4.9091,0.9029,0.0572,0.9513,2.2329,0.0316,0.0009,0.0012,0.3534,0.1988,1.4769,5.1807,0.7962,3.5965,5.1861,3.9583,4.5185,0.1216,5.6164,3.3132,1.8812,4.0497,3.2295,0.451,1.1848,1.9485,0.0222,1.2706,5.1431,4.0597,4.3062,0.8926,4.485,4.8257,5.3143,0.1598,2.2352,2.247,3.5804,1.8658,3.5474,5.2223,0.1217,4.2774,1.5472,0.6868,1.3271,0.8758,3.1721,1.7227,0.6528,2.2998,3.1665,5.0987,1.3075,4.0282,1.4976,0.961,3.0302,0.0005,0.0009,4.0485,0.0455,1.3344,2.7676,5.4995,3.5746,3.681,1.2918,0.7799,1.0197,4.6588,2.2568,2.8056,2.3742,6.3251,3.2705,5.2146,5.6151,3.405,2.9003,0.5277,2.4455,1.9636,1.0316,5.9106,1.3587,0.8211,0.0487,4.3075,2.2277,4.2039,5.1854,1.3167,2.7087,4.1495,0.9846,1.3678,6.6546,3.0396,0.8208,5.1204,2.3668,1.7493,0.0158,0.0009,0.001,0.5683,0.1375,1.1551,3.6538,1.7445,0.3328,3.2798,3.4659,0.3884,3.8551,1.288,0.3649,0.6735,0.8354,2.3122,0.4751,0.3636,0.2099,3.0135,2.562,1.8796,0.888,2.0699,0.6584,3.4044,3.7481,1.878,4.403,2.982,1.3311,2.2622,2.2966,1.1662,2.2924,1.5067,4.2091,0.4289,6.5256,6.3603,0.3643,4.5222,0.3044,0.8365,5.9213,4.5059,1.7974,3.1665,3.8089,0.7223,4.2599,0.6899,5.9419,3.8487,1.9491,0.0173,0.0011,0.0011,2.2277,0.9419,0.0736,1.9391,3.4899,1.8219,4.4255,2.1549,0.0479,1.3189,3.191,2.4617,1.2812,1.447,0.9138,0.3596,0.3941,1.1083,0.5864,2.4928,1.1807,7.1456,0.8833,1.7361,0.814]}
{"prompt":"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday ordered his military command to use all force necessary to secure the Sinai peninsula within the next three months following a militant attack on a mosque that killed","text":"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday ordered his military command to use all force necessary to secure the Sinai peninsula within the next three months following a militant attack on a mosque that killed six security forces and a civilian, army officials said.\n\u201cIt is up to the military command under the Presidency to mobilize all available forces within the next three months if necessary to secure military targets in Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula,\u201d said a release by the military general services news agency MENA.\nThe order comes as al-Sisi, who is also the president of Egypt\u2019s Armed Forces General Council, is meeting senior military brass to discuss the Sinai Peninsula to see if military operations against militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and al-Qaeda will be continued or scaled back in the coming months.\nThe attack on Friday at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the northern Sinai province of al-Kharab, a key target for militants, killed two security forces, an army official told AFP.\nThe military\u2019s latest move has raised the stakes in the ongoing security struggle with ISIS in the north Sinai Peninsula. Some 800 military personnel are based on a base in the heavily-armed city of al-Qantara on the Sinai Peninsula.\nThe military has announced several security operations over the past year aimed at taking back the two main ISIS sanctuaries in al-Kharab in the northern Sinai Peninsula and Ras Umm Bir in the southern Sinai.\nThe military said the latest security operation targeted militants and their strongholds in the area but did not provide precise details about the operation.\nThe attack in the al-Kharab area comes as militants on Friday overran another major base in the southern Sinai, but were forced to withdraw after troops and anti-terrorist units stormed the town of al-Duwair in southern Sinai, the official said.\nThe militants in control of the al-Duwair base include members of the Sinai Islamic Jihad Movement and the al-Shabab, according to the official.\nThe southern Sinai base, which they seized in June last year, contains at least 100 terrorists, including two senior leaders.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based, independent monitoring group, said the militants stormed into al-Duwair early Saturday morning, prompting the army to launch a counter-offensive to capture the town.\nThe southern base in the capital oases of al-Ramahiya and al-Salam, as well as a third one in al-Somaliya near the Sinai\u2019s border with Israel, have long

[ L1N1NY1RR ] The announcement, which North Korea said was the \" sixth and major \" step toward becoming a nuclear power, was met with condemnation from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. [ L7Q3Y4H1L1 ] [ L1N3Y1P]A senior North Korean official, quoted as saying the launch was aimed at testing its ballistic missile technology, expressed confidence that Pyongyang could eventually attain a nuclear capability. [ L1N3Y1P0 ] North Korea said the missile had a range of about 10,000 to 12,000km or 5,500 to 6,500 miles. [ L1N3Y4YH1 ] The North said the missile tested would likely be fitted with a tactical nuclear warhead.

Well I have a pretty hard and fast rule in terms of testing weapons. I know what I like. I will never let somebody else define what I want to do with a project when I have one. The North Koreans should be punished for launching a war into North Korea. This is not something I can put up with. This is not something I can sit by and let any nation launch a nuclear weapon into a sovereign nation. I stand with our allies and there is not a second that I will accept this. We will stand together. We are ready to take action against any aggressors against our country.

{"prompt":"South Sudan is hiking fees for humanitarians and blocking them from reaching hungry families , even as the oil-rich country appeals for nearly 2 billion dollars to help avert starvation amid a civil war ,","text":"South Sudan is hiking fees for humanitarians and blocking them from reaching hungry families, even as the oil-rich country appeals for nearly 2 billion dollars to help avert starvation amid a civil war, international financial institutions warn.\nBonnie Burton, the chief of mission at the US Agency for International Development, said Sunday\u2019s action was a threat to the world\u2019s ability to provide much-needed humanitarian aid to Sudan\u2019s conflict-stricken North, which depends on food aid to survive.\n\u201cThis is a major concern because Sudanese hunger is going to get higher and higher without immediate and substantial food assistance,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a global issue, it affects us all, and we need to work together to help.\u201d\nBurton told reporters the US \u201cis concerned about efforts to impose fees and tax rates on humanitarian actors and work with Sudan\u2019s government to review Sudan\u2019s fee policy.\u201d\nThe United Nations and other aid groups said last week the Sudanese government had demanded an international tax be imposed on humanitarian organizations to cover their operations in the North, despite the international community vowing to provide aid to the region that has faced ongoing violence since the end of last year.\n\u201cThis is in violation of all international aid principles, and it represents a real threat to life and security for the people of the country,\u201d spokeswoman Louise Arbour told reporters in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the humanitarian community, the international community continues to provide humanitarian assistance and there be no obstacle faced by any humanitarian aid organization coming in to help the Sudanese people.\u201d\nBurton has been in Khartoum talking with various government officials about Sudanese refugee camps. A Reuters spokeswoman said the US was discussing \u201cthe potential for the government to improve\u201d the humanitarian situation in the camps.\nIn response, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Sunday for the government of Sudan to allow humanitarian workers to continue reaching the region amid reports of high starvation rates in many areas.\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned on a high level that this is continuing, that Sudan is acting in a manner to impede international agencies providing food aid to the people of this country,\u201d Clinton told reporters at the State Department. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that the American government and international agencies have stopped providing food to the people of Sudan, but there\u2019s still concern that international agencies may not be allowed to deliver more food in the coming weeks.\u201d\nSudan\u2019s army accused rebels of attacking an oil pipeline to northern Sudan on Sunday, the first time military officials claimed a strike on the system since rebel attacks last month disrupted supplies to Port Sudan over 10 days.\nThe rebels claimed they struck an oil pipeline in Northern Kordofan state that transports crude oil from Sudan\u2019s oil-rich Kordofan region to the Red Sea port of Port Sudan, the capital of the southern port state of South Kordofan.","token_len":626,"entropy":[10.3598,6.675,12.2057,8.6073,1.5346,7.554,6.3159,0.0003,2.092,9.3142,5.0094,0.1694,4.5789,11.096,3.9515,1.8768,4.7016,1.5752,1.7393,7.0268,1.879,0.1478,0.9059,8.8182,1.0901,8.389,4.2869,1.6415,1.1415,2.2147,1.5085,5.9607,4.4358,5.7607,1.4313,3.5532,0.0268,3.4502,6.1656,6.2931,2.6564,3.6445,0.1146,0.2425,24.8029,1.7765,7.2016,0.5596,1.9784,3.2939,2.522,5.2573,1.0241,0.5558,4.9967,3.1421,0.0016,0.0001,0.0001,0.7714,0.6668,6.5869,19.0787,8.598,5.9835,6.199,1.2731,2.1904,5.8777,0.1489,1.3966,3.8131,3.1025,0.4243,0.8135,3.2616,0.0038,3.4522,6.4737,1.284,0.0012,2.914,0.4176,1.2534,2.6895,2.1051,0.0189,0.036,6.2706,0.2458,1.535,0.0004,7.0806,2.9713,1.8802,6.8861,0.311,4.0853,3.1415,2.3996,2.3851,0.4284,0.1603,11.4289,4.7769,6.6992,1.2521,1.2931,3.9504,4.4531,2.5864,4.1022,4.0056,5.3892,0.6737,6.1037,0.8352,3.1866,4.3102,2.1826,0.591,4.7961,5.9978,4.6618,2.9405,3.6038,1.693,1.2803,7.618,6.6527,1.7402,0.3394,0.5257,4.0606,0.2283,3.7454,2.135,4.6873,1.3209,0.0083,1.3579,5.8104,1.9664,2.2249,6.8818,8.7706,3.8775,0.372,1.2412,1.7993,1.5472,1.5077,0.3891,4.1255,0.5364,0.6723,2.5255,3.7861,1.2361,3.8662,0.4295,3.5137,0.0002,3.5312,1.3755,2.7199,2.4031,9.5932,0.7254,2.2028,3.8071,0.5901,6.6186,0.6188,5.1247,7.4064,2.962,5.3693,3.1032,0.3237,4.1242,7.059,2.4424,8.1064,1.2308,3.3349,2.0015,0.1305,0.0279,1.4233,0.3863,7.3318,5.7829,2.0957,0.0132,0.0076,8.7647,3.2399,0.7679,4.0418,1.4499,0.2589,2.3194,3.0013,1.1568,3.2032,1.7597,1.9886,2.0572,2.8625,4.1452,0.5109,2.8188,1.5266,0.3771,0.3367,2.1227,6.5561,3.0307,3.9899,6.0472,5.0384,0.6397,0.2625,3.4987,2.7362,2.9625,2.8794,2.5986,5.2849,1.4796,0.7581,3.1649,1.3901,4.4065,1.6363,4.8999,1.3781,10.1446,0.1448,0.4289,3.9842,2.9611,1.1,0.852,2.9762,5.2672,2.1356,4.208,5.0267,1.82,1.8965,1.4622,2.3929,0.0015,4.0407,0.1758,0.2013,0.3151,1.8349,0.4624,3.5483,0.7113,5.4818,2.9004,0.0251,4.3231,1.6983,5.0895,4.4624,1.2386,2.3344,2.2524,5.7664,0.4452,4.5022,0.5689,0.0952,7.0056,0.6806,3.4668,2.1783,1.3538,1.2695,0.2157,2.0038,2.8162,1.2358,0.5662,1.1252,6.5404,6.4502,5.2221,2.2776,1.5133,0.5375,1.9318,2.8884,0.071,0.3664,2.3444,0.0516,2.2738,0.9928,0.6012,0.0243,5.8282,0.7353,1.5348,5.3138,1.3079,3.5654,2.8156,1.5288,0.0832,6.6973,0.1184,3.602,2.4845,0.6906,2.8607,5.8463,6.5909,1.3472,6.7634,10.5941,0.3713,3.7252,2.5865,4.9223,1.088,7.3293,2.4414,1.72,2.0812,1.5047,3.6857,0.2941,0.2588,1.4512,0.4222,0.4907,0.1968,2.7051,0.0004,5.5846,1.8155,2.3873,6.4301,0.0071,0.0,0.0003,6.5217,0.8912,6.0756,3.9111,0.3263,1.8166,4.7632,2.5721,5.6563,2.9116,2.1085,4.3749,5.6495,6.3011,0.6913,1.7665,3.2297,2.3477,4.8582,8.0659,0.3295,1.5941,4.2213,1.9173,2.8488,3.0,0.4053,7.7754,6.552,2.5381,2.3052,3.8404,0.4786,0.8579,0.7118,4.84,0.9664,0.3637,3.6051,3.8657,1.456,4.8855,0.0559,0.0072,2.4078,0.3862,2.9486,4.9505,1.4915,1.6533,3.4777,1.7511,0.2781,0.1317,5.6744,1.6017,2.9753,0.5734,3.4719,6.6779,1.323,4.1438,5.9759,5.0275,0.5155,5.585,5.1111,1.3957,1.8292,4.2006,1.3211,0.6564,0.3501,1.7835,0.3506,3.4118,4.6059,0.0467,3.2595,0.9387,6.5913,1.9272,6.5291,0.4877,2.3494,2.934,1.4738,5.785,2.5034,2.6525,3.8965,1.6195,5.9449,1.2241,0.8731,2.5015,4.5657,3.9206,3.487,6.1678,4.3879,3.7169,2.2444,0.6965,0.4354,1.0099,0.305,2.308,0.4547,1.134,0.3842,0.5922,1.38,1.5039,0.4181,2.5714,0.6936,2.0454,0.0263,0.4899,1.3911,0.0441,2.9122,0.6851,0.3818,0.0122,3.6117,6.0726,3.0995,0.3282,2.0272,5.6956,0.9451,3.5698,3.2842,1.1638,2.3349,3.6471,2.1615,1.3744,2.5662,0.7345,0.1999,0.4837,0.7524,1.5266,2.0999,3.5879,2.2809,0.8923,0.397,2.3231,4.5712,1.3526,4.3332,0.4081,2.5356,1.5959,0.625,5.8553,0.1749,3.7176,6.0613,1.0378,3.3456,1.3966,2.8605,1.3488,1.1568,0.6833,0.3802,0.146,4.8547,0.0605,0.0013,3.6372,0.1704,0.2442,6.2319,6.7421,4.5226,0.1512,3.852,3.4188,3.2743,2.6256,3.678,4.6686,0.7497,2.2198,1.1248,0.7444,3.6573,1.8017,1.42,6.0265,3.0401,5.2952,3.0609,4.2119,1.8515,0.8967,5.5152,3.4176,5.3966,2.9729,3.7142,1.3087,8.3419,1.7822,1.5866,10.4382,1.4914,6.3318,7.6904,0.4604,0.9121,0.5472,2.0132,2.7394,2.8418,2.5105,4.826,3.0284,0.2281,0.327,2.2113,6.1508,4.8925,0.1599,0.0546,0.3107,6.2004,4.0012,6.1309,2.2166,0.5406,1.1595,1.7333,5.1953,0.1505,0.0718,1.844,2.1306,0.3953,4.907,0.1277,0.0302,0.0116,2.9001,0.6768,1.4095,5.6817,0.0111,3.4317,0.4701,3.5882,0.1266,1.2533,3.0467,3.7104,0.5261,1.3295,4.8515,5.5083,3.8106,0.1464,5.8014,2.2746,0.01,0.009,0.0026,0.529]}

accusations of","text":"Pakistan has appointed an economist, who was recently chairman of the board of investment, to take charge of the finance ministry after the former minister was relieved of his duties amid accusations of corruption.The new minister, Mohammad Amir Moayedi, will be the first to be appointed since the former PM Bhutto returned home last week from her three-month trip abroad.Moayedi served as treasurer in the Pakistan International Airlines Board, which was blamed for a failure of information and communication technology ( I & T) leading to the disappearance of a Boeing 727 aircraft on July 9 last year.His appointment suggests that the present government will not appoint another top bureaucrat as finance minister despite the recent arrests and subsequent judicial executions of senior bureaucrats in the past few weeks.Moayedi will have to work through the economic downturn, which some analysts say will last for at least five to six years.He will also need to address the serious problems at the central bank, where inflation is at an all-time high.\nChina's foreign finance ministry, which had been responsible for the foreign currency reserves of the central bank, is going to be handed some of these powers to enable the central bank to handle foreign exchange contracts.The transfer of powers will require a review of China's current foreign exchange policy.Under China's central bank policy, the trade surplus is supposed to be used to accumulate foreign exchange in order to achieve balance of payments equilibrium.In practice, however, many China are using their foreign exchange reserves abroad to buy other assets such as gold and real estate, or borrow from banks abroad.Many companies have resorted to such practices to avoid having to accumulate foreign currency.Now the central bank, which collects the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions, has been allowed to lend some of these reserves to foreign central banks, and to other Chinese government agencies -including the National Development and Reform Commission.\nIn November 2001, the central bank, the State Bank of China, decided to make small monthly payments over several months to buy foreign exchange market futures for Chinese state enterprises.This move is intended to stabilise the currency, and may also make the Chinese authorities slightly more comfortable about the direction of exchange control.\nOver the months it seems to have worked, since last March China's currencies have kept close to its targeted exchange rate.But on Friday, the People's Bank of China cut its official rate further by 25 basis points.It put its rates for January, February, March, April, May, June and July the same as those in force on November 25.The policy cut came after a recent surge in short-term official rates which have now reached their highest levels so far this year.\nMeanwhile, interest for currency contracts on futures markets in Shanghai continued to fall on

Authorities did not say how many turtles were killed, but police estimates put the number of turtles killed up to 100.","token_len":626,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,10.2633,12.1807,3.9877,0.5124,4.7756,0.8972,2.5832,0.353,5.2831,12.4734,6.8762,2.0604,7.807,7.1775,6.7319,0.699,1.3822,3.5053,4.9628,0.002,1.9473,0.2818,2.2945,2.0185,0.129,3.4484,1.9016,0.0718,4.8259,9.849,1.2214,5.6522,3.1323,0.6027,1.6338,0.0009,1.3398,0.3218,0.0088,2.1857,1.5662,2.8647,3.3513,0.1164,0.1344,7.9997,1.4119,5.4803,1.4181,1.4029,0.027,2.7738,2.2436,8.1124,0.6108,0.1053,3.5614,0.893,0.4785,1.4628,0.754,1.0986,5.0567,1.5212,3.5485,4.0323,3.9769,4.5873,1.7351,1.579,0.8503,0.4676,3.6078,1.3488,1.621,5.1135,2.0298,1.0244,6.12,1.5364,1.5585,3.2185,2.9848,0.0976,1.3758,9.7401,1.2307,0.1644,1.275,1.0251,0.0081,2.3654,0.8862,4.1026,0.7427,1.1335,0.5239,0.0322,3.2571,2.9334,4.0765,1.1065,2.0959,0.0284,0.935,1.2253,1.1989,5.5129,2.2117,7.3622,0.3577,3.6443,4.3352,3.7149,2.6921,2.6607,1.6413,6.8759,0.9743,1.3571,4.4969,1.6329,2.4879,1.0207,3.627,2.8729,4.0622,1.9483,1.557,7.3397,1.9216,4.7875,3.9263,3.4841,3.5635,1.3873,2.2332,5.0349,6.0473,6.1155,1.079,2.2827,2.1481,3.9293,3.5054,8.7153,4.958,0.0435,0.7266,4.7276,0.153,8.4792,0.638,7.0396,5.851,0.8472,0.4261,2.4329,5.4705,5.6757,10.2902,9.5473,0.7058,0.9455,8.5696,0.2294,0.0123,0.0043,2.098,1.2967,0.1998,0.1775,2.448,0.1559,6.0809,0.0044,2.2197,4.5527,5.2591,1.096,2.3001,4.9015,0.8086,1.7874,2.1362,2.4084,1.3773,2.1082,2.4828,2.3259,5.3905,2.7218,2.609,8.2209,6.5061,2.7776,0.1487,3.033,8.5562,7.6512,0.173,4.7527,7.5493,0.8173,4.0334,6.0843,0.766,1.6495,2.3036,7.7221,5.5969,6.8759,1.5355,6.0607,4.8112,2.032,5.4427,4.8571,0.7764,5.4782,2.4843,0.4497,1.6043,3.9258,0.0013,0.0973,3.9991,0.3814,6.0054,3.4696,5.8931,0.7664,3.4108,1.0041,2.6266,1.4066,1.066,6.9955,0.2518,5.3779,0.0085,2.3767,0.9712,2.9067,4.3358,1.3571,2.7651,3.7001,0.1883,3.3679,4.4822,0.049,4.9651,2.0842,0.2194,2.9923,0.7068,0.6713,0.6274,5.5899,0.4666,0.5715,1.5342,2.0431,1.6545,0.2282,1.9569,2.6679,2.9482,2.9109,0.0022,1.4082,0.1569,0.0011,7.2006,6.2442,0.2889,4.9885,4.2961,3.3206,1.6069,7.0186,0.2576,5.5357,1.2605,2.0121,4.9802,6.2941,2.9478,5.8798,2.3774,5.1136,0.7662,2.8517,0.8624,5.7046,1.1094,9.2654,5.356,0.0487,2.3559,0.4272,1.096,0.9195,3.1796,3.6252,0.433,1.874,3.1549,3.7614,3.1852,2.965,4.4301,2.6063,0.0074,1.6371,5.9102,3.2958,3.2945,7.9669,3.3198,1.3171,0.9474,5.5435,1.8755,2.8016,5.7525,5.1707,0.7789,2.0272,3.9736,0.0262,3.342,3.0623,3.7643,3.2813,1.7657,8.3523,5.8601,5.5238,1.191,4.6903,0.0125,3.6021,4.8095,0.0425,6.2429,0.0398,0.0026,0.2839,2.1069,4.704,1.328,5.8758,7.0335,1.0492,0.2453,0.4536,2.1279,1.5664,0.0899,1.4195,3.2762,2.5169,2.2045,7.6175,2.6578,0.1222,0.0071,0.8155,3.7691,1.6932,0.2561,2.0153,0.0078,1.6487,3.2165,2.0538,3.6364,2.849,0.0132,4.7706,0.0971,0.0684,2.4923,0.0181,1.2237,3.6178,0.2771,0.7727,5.0231,0.0167,0.0043,0.0016,2.443,3.3353,3.3427,3.7367,2.526,5.6236,0.0063,6.0768,0.0028,3.5375,5.2866,0.0094,2.0788,7.7319,4.4163,0.0059,1.1095,5.2165,0.0604,0.0094,6.174,0.9933,0.0976,3.6659,5.814,0.2652,0.8591,6.8504,5.3119,4.5505,0.1187,3.4947,12.0927,2.103,2.0914,2.3977,6.4724,1.8879,3.8358,3.1994,4.2247,3.7758,1.0565,4.9916,1.0676,0.6574,0.5387,4.1089,4.0622,1.7091,1.7341,2.1003,0.9934,6.7895,1.5667,3.6331,0.0559,0.5811,1.9448,2.6471,2.1922,3.995,3.2841,3.327,3.132,2.7215,0.012,0.7203,1.468,3.058,0.0007,2.9589,0.2079,4.8901,1.7112,0.2606,1.5118,2.3133,1.3052,6.4458,1.719,6.0944,1.0342,7.2803,0.101,1.5898,3.4205,2.4347,2.1536,4.1044,0.2094,0.703,1.799,0.0041,4.499,0.0461,0.0031,0.0015,0.6833,1.769,3.5328,1.0087,5.6956,1.5225,6.2255,1.6432,2.8689,1.9224,0.0949,0.5339,1.3403,5.5258,0.1554,2.2851,2.2514,1.8671,5.9462,0.666,3.116,1.8091,7.13,8.4631,1.35,7.2369,1.9931,6.1298,0.7158,1.7688,4.7821,4.795,0.5488,3.2523,1.9486,1.273,3.3998,3.386,1.5923,0.1574,1.5796,1.4564,0.1857,5.2273,6.7335,0.6226,7.4017,3.1044,0.5989,5.1868,5.2682,1.3771,1.6437,0.0863,2.8002,1.4979,1.175,4.9082,1.1657,0.0106,3.0676,0.0122,1.1876,4.0827,2.1725,1.6389,5.5339,2.8799,0.5302,3.0043,5.273,0.0043,3.5674,0.4677,3.0849,3.0835,6.5331,7.0578,2.4462,8.0383,0.1277,0.3352,5.2116,0.9297,0.1642,1.9884,0.499,5.3683,0.5509,1.8137,4.0376,0.3646,2.7648,3.3237,0.6896,3.4495,0.4986,0.0885,2.3005,1.3906,0.6172,3.0777,2.1677,2.0934,0.3172,1.4913,0.113,0.0749,3.3747,3.9928,0.0271,1.8482,1.2528,0.1648,1.9406,0.6102,1.134,1.2074,0.9364,4.1691,6.2626,3.5804,0.3727,0.3617,2.302,1.6778,1.222,5.7091,0.007,2.5529,0.3889]}

No deal today I ve just been told # brexit, Katya van der Vliet on BBC1\nA post shared by BBC Europe ( @ europe ) on Nov 24, 2020 at 12:59pm PST\n\"I ve just been told that there wont be a deal today. The European Council said it would look at the possibility that a deal might be reached Saturday. But again, today, there wont be a deal,\" said EU negotiator Catherine Leterme. \"I think it s very likely that we will come to this on November 29th,\" she said. \"Like I said, there are lots of hurdles to clear and the British are not prepared to take those.\"\nThe European Council had said that a deal should be able to be reached by Saturday and negotiations continue now.\n\"Things are working. I believe we need to work until Friday, and then we will have to see,\" said Mr Macron, adding that a deal probably wouldn't come before Christmas.\nBritain will leave the EU on Dec 31 and be placed in a transition period of 11 months, during which it and other EU member countries will work to iron out the divorce.\nFor the UK, the EU is a major trading partner and a key source of investment. For the EU, Brexit will leave the UK without a free trade treaty with the bloc and with no voice in the EU s decision-making processes, among other issues.\n\"We have reached an important milestone in our negotiations,\" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after a meeting with his EU counterparts. \"I am very happy that weve finally reached one of the big blocks. We are not only achieving progress today, but also that the agreement is achievable for us all.\"\nThe British government, however, has repeatedly claimed that Brussels is blocking what they call their proposals for security, and has been unwilling to discuss the controversial backstop provision, which was in the original withdrawal agreement.\nBritain wants to avoid a hard Brexit and is insisting that it retains enough of the control that the EU has given it for a post-Brexit trade deal. As part of their deal, the UK was given the right to negotiate trade deals with third countries.\nHowever, no country has yet said it would sign up to such a deal, meaning that negotiations with the European Union, the United States and other partners are all but over.\nThe EU is seeking security commitments, including for the UK, but in a statement, the 28 leaders of the bloc said they had accepted British proposals that \"they will work towards making UK security assurances more robust in the coming weeks and months, as the deal is being negotiated\". But they rejected the so-called Irish backstop, or the backstop measure to protect the United Kingdom from a hard border with Ireland after Brexit.\nThis week, the UK's foreign secretary Dominic Raab wrote an open letter to UK diplomats asking them to prepare for a new round of talks with the European Union before 31 December.","token_len":626,"entropy":[3.3356,1.6469,2.8578,0.4652,2.8528,5.0173,0.1547,5.0755,4.2495,2.5532,1.5426,0.9658,3.6298,1.1365,3.1464,3.6456,10.8357,0.7185,3.1841,2.8507,1.8362,0.1798,10.1325,1.002,9.123,8.194,12.0219,5.5319,3.3358,0.8946,6.7215,15.0191,0.0056,4.0159,13.0356,1.0882,5.1303,0.9904,3.2437,2.7068,0.0914,4.7817,5.4069,3.2026,3.4332,12.0423,6.2026,0.059,0.0008,5.383,1.1647,5.2562,5.8298,10.9323,1.4917,5.7171,0.4753,2.4994,2.9093,0.0037,12.1569,0.0004,2.1436,0.0053,3.7042,0.4415,0.0685,0.2145,3.4224,2.5351,2.9783,0.0239,0.0027,0.0025,2.4749,3.4933,10.4194,0.0205,0.6432,0.8953,1.9361,1.423,2.6807,3.0228,2.6919,4.3964,2.065,1.5285,4.1586,0.6396,1.3695,3.6779,4.201,2.0768,1.1202,3.0081,0.4285,0.9094,9.1236,1.8106,2.5662,6.9245,0.8768,5.0356,2.2808,2.9356,4.6344,0.0148,0.3491,0.1255,2.4988,2.2817,5.5541,3.2671,3.7208,9.7027,8.1041,3.9557,0.9764,2.1138,2.2997,2.5689,1.8241,9.7127,3.5276,2.8257,0.3814,2.3438,0.7348,4.6055,1.0551,4.514,5.3695,5.9546,2.7445,1.1071,3.0218,0.4744,1.0271,0.3228,1.6678,7.9191,1.8373,0.1211,0.6483,2.4432,3.1809,3.456,0.0311,5.9741,1.5233,2.9875,2.7491,2.7403,5.2002,3.2398,2.2166,2.6279,0.4601,3.1179,3.0372,2.8326,0.7579,2.2483,2.8576,0.9435,3.8223,2.6228,2.2158,2.1751,0.455,3.4397,0.3782,6.8583,0.011,0.5655,0.4934,1.386,3.1966,3.2892,6.3832,5.1888,7.5549,1.0212,1.3531,2.5023,7.2119,0.9217,4.8223,3.3294,2.6212,3.2304,1.927,4.2474,0.5067,3.2246,5.6735,4.2062,2.2493,2.5076,1.2626,1.3016,1.0384,2.3237,1.4718,3.2187,3.4467,0.89,4.2899,4.9252,1.4168,3.3872,0.294,3.2145,0.7183,9.0263,2.7642,0.0064,3.2652,4.0347,1.8579,0.5977,0.5767,4.2795,3.0962,2.5779,0.0481,0.5534,2.049,4.2888,2.0085,3.1155,4.5128,5.9866,1.1244,1.4651,5.7593,0.964,1.6301,6.3223,0.8111,1.5173,5.9096,0.0142,1.2939,7.0581,1.9929,0.904,0.9554,4.6406,0.8318,4.8336,1.3591,8.4776,0.0217,1.7414,3.875,2.655,0.742,5.5738,1.9017,2.8895,0.6746,1.1131,2.844,2.5374,2.7186,4.1741,3.3036,0.319,1.5917,2.6508,1.9278,2.8818,0.0224,3.7616,1.9196,5.3368,1.0203,1.6161,0.6327,2.8821,2.1146,3.1836,1.2762,0.8491,3.225,1.4085,3.9398,0.07,5.9952,1.2733,0.2678,3.6087,2.0203,2.4402,3.4008,7.3167,0.3759,0.882,1.16,12.2293,3.066,0.4892,0.0043,3.5398,2.1361,6.7656,0.2247,1.857,0.1765,0.4617,3.013,1.9403,1.8751,5.6255,1.147,3.4629,3.1217,1.7325,1.4903,2.1903,2.4593,5.1983,0.6059,0.0029,8.6066,0.0028,0.324,3.0619,2.3136,0.9545,0.428,3.5474,1.7202,0.5658,0.9893,0.7111,2.5615,1.3704,1.6114,1.3287,1.151,0.8961,11.8746,4.7222,0.8127,6.6957,1.2581,0.3005,4.8768,6.9826,3.1696,1.6378,1.7196,3.3683,3.2173,5.9596,4.981,6.0289,0.6011,0.7287,1.7167,4.2176,2.4483,5.4889,1.85,4.6639,2.7824,2.6428,2.9916,0.9096,0.3445,1.6814,3.1134,0.9506,3.7734,2.2935,0.0026,1.6051,3.7978,4.1549,0.2944,6.1554,1.524,4.8512,6.997,4.2236,1.836,6.3742,6.7182,1.9724,8.7313,2.6253,2.8439,2.448,3.1482,5.9893,0.0625,3.6589,1.5091,6.7522,7.7896,3.3155,6.9021,2.7031,0.7755,3.1976,4.5064,1.6791,4.3811,8.0682,1.0569,0.9127,0.4718,3.5859,3.898,0.8017,3.5972,1.2243,3.0823,0.9107,1.8471,2.4839,5.64,0.6641,1.6144,5.7791,7.0416,2.0759,1.0853,4.4035,2.9989,2.3928,1.2954,1.5395,3.896,0.5726,3.689,3.1432,4.9852,0.0135,0.1309,3.5946,0.6525,0.5097,5.8181,2.6569,0.0023,3.4029,3.084,0.6211,0.8897,0.4786,4.6703,2.8625,1.6006,0.5702,0.0416,3.6164,3.5427,1.2677,0.5291,5.0738,0.542,2.2176,0.6881,3.1089,0.0349,5.8961,6.8893,1.236,2.8445,4.1721,1.7021,1.5533,3.3184,1.3026,0.5111,2.4228,0.3893,0.3035,1.2333,4.2553,0.7726,4.2169,2.9063,1.4654,3.0846,0.953,3.9056,2.5201,2.7304,0.5166,0.6004,1.2518,3.4251,1.6922,6.3136,4.9737,1.9023,0.4667,0.4866,1.7747,2.2772,2.2311,3.9938,8.7417,5.9537,3.3132,1.2903,3.0895,1.6421,0.944,1.4145,2.5177,5.0022,2.5161,4.6024,3.4165,1.044,6.4755,4.746,3.587,0.2397,2.1847,0.6041,1.5682,2.3351,5.3809,5.7746,2.8798,3.4268,3.1698,5.5676,2.2256,4.2633,3.2338,5.118,5.1672,2.9469,7.0501,2.0072,3.2017,3.2208,0.7675,3.4065,2.4349,1.0495,0.1008,2.7907,2.9457,3.1541,5.5299,1.098,3.2292,0.9538,1.0911,5.4149,2.0165,4.8119,1.5608,6.9457,0.045,0.0016,7.9558,5.4315,0.0577,1.5417,6.0292,2.378,5.5967,0.0598,7.3351,4.6808,3.2881,1.908,4.7656,0.3408,0.8846,2.8585,2.5001,2.5435,0.7201,1.2667,4.7442,1.39,0.3323,0.2795,5.3154,3.1162,0.663,1.0558,2.0981,2.389,2.8093,0.4026,9.7526,1.2411,0.0042,5.6458,4.1572,0.2568,0.0017,0.196,5.3093,4.6146,3.4238,0.3966,0.1557,4.6862,0.7153,1.0672,4.7085,2.7288,0.0052,0.764,1.7856,0.494,1.7544,0.8451,4.5154,8.7942,0.364,0.5569]}

This...\nWe have all been asked by a colleague or friend to explain something once before. This happened to me last week. It happened to someone else at work. When one of our colleagues asked me to explain Facebook I started to think about it - how did I do it? I couldn't. Then I sat down and began my explanation. The key was to make sure I explained it succinctly and carefully. The person needed to be able to understand the basic principles quickly and easily. It has been said \u2018you get more out of a person you can explain than you do an explanation' \u2013 I think the other way around is also true. If you can explain things well then the person who is listening can put them into action. You can explain something and it may not mean anything \u2013 so it is essential that your explanation makes them think, it stimulates them and inspires them. If we cannot explain why something is important then our message may simply be ignored. An example is the need to protect our computer systems. We need to make it clear to people that they need to keep their software up to date - otherwise they will expose themselves to malware. I explain to staff that my own computer is not safe so my work is not safe and it is important that I make sure that my work is safe. I use other examples including the fact that their phones and tablets are not safe, and that I would never write or use Facebook if I thought they were not safe \u2013 so it all comes down to personal responsibility. An alternative solution is to simply say \u2018if I don't use something my work isn't safe'. There is a problem with this as it is not always easy for staff to understand.

{"prompt":"China s graft-busters will be required to do more to protect detained suspects , such as informing families and employers within a day of their detention , state media said on Friday , as part","text":"China s graft-busters will be required to do more to protect detained suspects, such as informing families and employers within a day of their detention, state media said on Friday, as part of new laws to be discussed at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress next week.\nIf successful, this would be the first time China has made public a set of reforms to the security system that it has kept secret since 2013.\nThe draft for a new law, which is not open to public view, will be considered during the annual session of the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress, which starts on January 9.\nThe law establishes new measures for the detention of foreigners under suspicion, and will be used to punish foreigners for terrorist offences, including illegal attempts to obtain sensitive state secrets.\nIt will stipulate that foreigners suspected of participating in terrorist activities can be detained for no longer than 60 days to complete intelligence and background checks. They may be held without access to their families for not more than 15 days, and may be forced to undergo interrogations.\nThe draft also tightened controls on public access to detention facilities for suspected terrorists by introducing a new criminal offence.\nDetained suspects must be permitted to see a lawyer, a family member or a medical professional, and their status must be declared publicly within three days of detention.\nThey must also be allowed to communicate with the world outside China, and be informed of their rights to lodge a complaint and legal representation, if they wish.\nThe draft law also provides for more thorough monitoring of detention facilities, and is expected to help ease the public s perception that some foreign suspects are being punished in an arbitrary manner.\nChina says security targets have killed thousands and injured tens of thousands since the deadly attacks in Paris in November, which killed at least 129.\nThe United States has accused China of masterminding the attack.\nIn response, Chinese President Xi Jinping told the United States that human rights in China were no less precious, and made the case for the measures that the new law would take.\nChina will be seeking broad consensus from the Standing Committee, with the law likely to be approved at later this month.\nIt is expected to be published in the Chinese government s official gazette later in January and be applicable to foreign suspects arrested immediately.\nThe state media says an agreement is needed between China and major governments on how to manage foreigners detained in China, but will not say exactly which countries are part of this.\nChina s security targets include former military dictator Meng Hail un, fugitive Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, and dissident Chinese-American Chen Guangcheng.\nBoris Johnson says his new coalition Government, including two conservatives, is more committed to tackling the issue of China s

{"prompt":"The driver of a tour bus that crashed on Tuesday on a quiet road in Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula , killing 12 people , may have lost control after one of the front tires exploded","text":"The driver of a tour bus that crashed on Tuesday on a quiet road in Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, killing 12 people, may have lost control after one of the front tires exploded.\nAccording to Mexican witnesses, the bus hit a concrete barrier early Tuesday morning and then stopped next to a river.\nSome witnesses said a fire ripped through the vehicle shortly before it hit the bridge near the town of Progreso, in the state of Yucatan. The bus was traveling in the north direction, towards the town of Valladolid just before the accident, witnesses said.\n\"There were flames coming from the bus. We saw a man, a woman and three children dead,\" said a local man, Ignacio Rojas.\nAccording to local media, the bus had left a tourist site and was heading for Valladolid, but the driver failed to notice a bridge close to a mountain and crashed head-on.\nThe bus operator told a local television station that it was carrying 41 passengers when it crashed, adding that a fire was also reported in the bus.\nThe bus operator said some passengers reported seeing lights in the area where the accident occurred. But the local government said it took them several hours to inspect the accident site after police arrived to help with the rescue.\nAll passengers died and were transported to a morgue, the government of Mexico's state of Yucatan said in a statement.\nThe bus had been carrying 21 passengers and 12 crew members when it began its trip in the morning, Mexico's official information director said.\nThe tour operator was not immediately available for comment when Mexpress called. But the company is part of the giant Mexicana, one of the country s largest conglomerates and the parent to both the Mexican Airline and Mexicana Bus Lines.\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the bus trip was suspended while investigators looked into the accident and offered condolences to the victims.\n\"The bus was carrying young people from Mexico to an event in San Cristobal,\" a town on the outskirts of Valladolid, said Pena Nieto during a regular morning press conference. \"Each of those people is our sister, each of those people is our brother.\"\nNieto also said the bus company was suspending its operations and was preparing for the possibility that other vehicles could also have been involved. He said authorities were investigating if the bus had one or more problems, though it would likely require a major overhaul to be safe again.\nThe bus driver, Manuel Espada, was taken to hospital after the crash because of injuries he sustained, local authorities told reporters.\nOn Saturday, the company's general manager, Gustavo Perez, said the bus was being used to visit a tourist site and was returning to Valladolid when it crashed. A spokesman, Alfonso Nacif, said on a radio station that Perez was a member of the rescue team that arrived on the scene.\nThis was the first tour bus accident in Yucatan in seven years, when nine passengers died and 21 were injured after a bus crashed into a cliff.","token_len":628,"entropy":[9.0456,1.6132,1.9343,10.1117,0.1764,2.3521,2.7427,2.699,5.6731,4.9477,2.1401,4.8225,2.3527,1.0268,6.6092,12.5449,12.1237,0.417,0.2649,3.8888,1.4478,4.7197,4.3809,0.3975,0.5414,5.1249,0.589,5.3163,0.7685,3.2367,5.3748,0.2318,0.4711,6.5577,3.0543,3.6894,1.2936,0.4391,18.2912,0.0024,3.3972,8.4215,0.1587,0.6848,1.1741,3.4182,0.8299,3.5449,1.5187,6.7364,0.8285,1.0619,1.6775,2.6035,5.096,7.8408,0.0079,0.9144,5.6626,1.7857,0.9831,5.42,1.1574,0.9397,3.4518,5.1327,4.8392,0.2162,0.1278,3.0663,4.857,1.133,1.9681,1.6408,0.3176,3.3994,4.386,0.7577,3.2928,0.0546,8.0946,1.9935,0.1391,1.0607,3.5816,0.883,2.5809,0.0785,3.2481,0.0012,0.1386,0.5718,2.4158,2.2417,1.3847,2.0933,2.8398,1.0042,4.6734,3.2973,1.7176,7.4331,0.894,2.3066,0.2144,6.7765,0.7604,0.0084,6.9087,1.6816,1.8221,1.931,1.4101,2.4971,0.1616,0.082,0.2061,2.7343,2.8808,1.3839,3.5838,2.7034,0.4782,0.364,1.6959,2.3689,2.6114,1.5582,1.878,3.2846,3.8287,2.198,1.9777,0.9971,3.3752,0.9504,6.5046,1.0094,0.7082,2.4912,3.4488,3.2276,1.4692,8.3571,0.0102,5.7556,0.3179,1.0746,0.721,3.7553,0.0016,2.7381,1.2739,0.6475,0.8469,1.1158,2.5227,4.0927,2.9631,7.66,4.542,2.3609,1.3146,1.4467,2.7878,3.2174,0.0074,0.0002,1.2883,2.3881,1.7146,1.0541,3.9854,0.0101,4.4948,3.3664,5.2479,6.4413,0.3296,4.83,5.6824,2.712,2.4819,3.7674,0.4067,0.0609,2.4475,0.5974,1.5419,1.588,5.8073,1.9742,3.4204,0.6651,2.1188,0.1798,0.2873,3.0957,0.8123,4.4217,8.0388,1.5665,3.349,0.6898,1.2354,1.9986,4.3282,0.1604,3.6655,3.4486,1.8108,3.2729,2.9604,2.4143,0.3354,3.4452,0.6142,0.384,1.3874,1.8175,2.7443,0.8343,6.2316,1.9804,4.8282,1.5443,6.625,2.0416,0.097,2.6603,4.0993,0.198,1.4831,0.4878,0.7282,5.2331,1.6983,3.954,3.7329,1.6867,1.6239,5.769,5.3745,2.4198,0.5001,0.1059,4.9428,0.1814,3.5344,0.8487,4.3264,5.4084,2.3289,3.2295,3.1595,2.8681,0.5246,2.9929,1.0759,0.2168,6.5631,4.2989,6.6262,3.4138,4.4878,2.1854,0.081,1.0856,5.7893,0.0002,1.4808,1.8732,3.359,5.9736,1.4135,2.6923,3.3796,0.187,1.3134,0.0044,0.0038,0.591,0.74,0.0378,0.1304,0.3594,0.3906,1.2105,1.9451,3.1384,1.2579,2.2503,4.8979,1.1712,1.8011,3.3663,1.4545,0.3763,1.9484,0.2925,5.0257,2.7491,2.7788,2.872,1.0536,4.2025,0.7607,5.0793,0.121,3.7197,6.4046,8.1467,1.7071,0.4325,0.6015,1.0987,7.1417,3.8647,2.9978,2.1846,1.0161,0.0707,0.1872,0.0446,5.432,14.7336,10.184,4.6787,1.263,5.2927,1.8662,3.445,3.9443,4.472,0.0202,1.1331,5.9145,5.8435,2.8278,0.9331,2.745,3.7246,0.0051,0.4649,3.2059,11.4896,1.6953,3.7694,0.009,2.9547,2.0001,3.4699,4.6876,5.534,1.8583,2.4779,4.8369,2.9571,0.9245,4.4558,0.5299,0.0293,6.5769,2.2427,0.3793,0.4448,3.0472,2.0037,3.3009,0.041,1.3753,0.0002,0.0,1.6356,1.7813,1.4418,7.4129,0.8912,7.5897,4.1111,3.29,4.0655,0.1625,0.1412,1.4116,2.4897,4.7747,1.3925,0.3865,0.4245,0.8642,0.6494,0.4569,1.3128,2.0501,2.0837,1.9456,2.6589,6.3682,0.7118,2.0817,2.0476,2.3678,6.626,5.416,0.8291,5.7563,4.8081,0.2263,1.6343,4.7437,7.3956,3.2745,0.2105,2.705,0.001,3.7121,0.0025,0.0001,0.8175,1.9712,5.3068,0.0074,0.0164,4.2398,0.1717,7.6491,5.3706,1.915,0.2142,0.6504,0.7772,7.2936,1.4461,3.1674,1.2827,2.9112,3.3514,5.0248,1.8235,5.7847,0.6111,2.7369,0.815,0.5391,0.3455,1.6701,0.8455,0.1757,5.5856,3.821,0.4094,3.5604,1.4018,1.359,1.1053,4.5593,1.754,5.8948,1.6936,0.4556,2.7611,2.9767,4.5368,1.2296,1.7299,2.6522,2.331,4.6792,3.952,1.5929,3.0858,3.394,0.9594,0.2328,1.0079,3.3496,1.0681,3.9241,1.3789,2.2252,3.9545,1.1077,1.3012,1.5419,6.4411,1.6608,0.2546,5.4258,2.0367,3.4837,2.7747,2.6714,4.0286,3.9607,2.0375,3.9918,1.3305,2.4063,3.5919,3.7771,4.2891,0.2017,0.2541,1.4378,1.7177,2.2198,1.5924,5.7349,5.9319,4.9737,0.5088,1.7899,3.3098,0.3775,2.2834,2.6288,0.6314,0.9259,6.3101,0.6787,2.4844,1.9659,0.6011,2.0848,5.2474,3.2931,3.4706,2.3046,0.3274,0.9092,4.5333,3.7977,0.3342,1.76,4.5387,2.5377,4.367,0.2582,0.873,5.457,0.0219,5.2335,0.7421,1.008,1.2447,2.0546,1.4348,3.6497,2.9327,1.3605,5.3559,3.2094,4.0639,0.7394,3.061,2.0289,3.721,0.4527,4.1955,0.0013,0.0002,3.2081,0.9405,1.0784,0.5096,4.3651,2.9783,4.6805,6.3927,0.0151,5.1141,2.8819,6.6369,2.0834,0.5283,4.2109,5.596,3.1713,1.2733,0.3191,2.7677,0.95,4.326,2.7352,0.0032,0.3806,7.0281,0.3126,2.3901,2.1733,2.2935,0.4044,0.1272,0.7834,0.3569,6.6619,2.6641,0.5724,2.0641,8.4519,0.4983,1.0739,0.5148,1.6769,0.0079,0.0043,2.459,4.944,0.1638,1.1202,4.0644,5.5601,3.0923,1.5639,1.3146,5.0498,0.8323,0.2261,2.8423,0.5456,1.1362,2.3273,1.9237,0.3306,3.4459,2.4942]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would get into \u201c great detail \u201d in the next two weeks on his U.S. tax reform plan , which has been short on specifics , even","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would get into \u201c great detail \u201d in the next two weeks on his U.S. tax reform plan, which has been short on specifics, even after two months of negotiations. Trump\u2019s proposals to reduce corporate tax rates, lower taxes on high-earning individuals and repeal an estate tax, are expected to be included in tax legislation to reduce the federal deficit, according to Reuters last month. The Treasury Department has said it expects legislation in the next few weeks, but it remains unclear whether he will adopt those plans. Trump said he hoped to announce the details Monday or Tuesday, which would give the two parties time to prepare. \u201c You know, we are in the process of working on all the details, and we are in the process of doing exactly what it is we are supposed to be doing, which is negotiating, \u201d said Trump on CNBC. Trump said he could not announce a deadline for when he expects tax legislation to be signed into law. The president of the United States told CNBC that he could have lawmakers vote on his plan in the two weeks leading up to his Dec. 22 deadline for a comprehensive tax cut that he said he hopes to cut taxes for everyone. Trump told the network that he would \u201c be able to do it much sooner than I think most of those folks even expect me to \u2014 you know, some of the people that are negotiating \u2026 the legislation. \u201d Trump\u2019s tax proposal is expected to provide a wide range of tax reductions, including for wealthy Americans, and has sparked anger among some Republican members of Congress. Some Republicans in the House, particularly on the right, have said they would oppose any tax plan that would not eliminate the tax exemption for corporations. They argued that tax cuts would benefit mostly individuals and small businesses instead of big companies. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who heads the Republican party, has said the budget bill is the most important debate for his party this year, and he has been urging lawmakers to agree to more tax cuts than those he wants. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who heads the Senate, has suggested there could be tax legislation \u201c very, very, very soon \u201d amid expectations that talks between Trump and Senate Democratic leaders may have broken down. On CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d host Steve Kroft was asked when Trump would announce the details of his tax plan, telling his audience that his remarks appeared to suggest that Monday or Tuesday could be good start. \u201c I will get into great detail, \u201d Trump said.

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating Republican Representative Blake Farenthold over allegations of sexual harassment , discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member . The panel","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating Republican Representative Blake Farenthold over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. The panel said Farenthold would need to testify to explain the alleged incidents, which are alleged to occur when Farenthold was a Washington state Rep.\nWASHINGTON (AP) A Senate bill would require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to give its blessing for any drug used in the same indications as an existing drug in about six months, cutting down on potentially dangerous conflicts of interest in deciding who gets access to innovative medicines that could save lives.\nRep. Steve Womack and Sen. John Cornyn, the sponsors of the bipartisan bill, say the time lag would help avoid the FDA turning down an older drug used in the same indications that an experimental treatment could provide, based on concerns that the experimental drug may cause more harm.\nThe legislation has bipartisan support. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said the bill\u2019s passage would help ensure that FDA is focused on making the best decisions for public health and not trying to appease drug companies. Rep. Jim Moran, a member of the Appropriations subcommittee that is reviewing legislation authored by Womack and Cornyn, said the bill has the support of a broad audience.\nThe bill would require the FDA to file a petition with the agency by Aug. 1. In its petition, the FDA must include the following information:\nThe petition also requires that the agency explain whether the petition will be actioned promptly or will require an extension.\nIn cases when the FDA does not act within the six-month period, the petition would require it to file a recordation and respond within 60 days. The recordation would list the reasons the agency decided not to act and that the FDA will act when possible.\nIn addition, the bill would require that if a new drug candidate or supplement is approved through the process called fast track, it be used and reimbursed within the six-month period if the new treatment provides the same benefits as the existing treatment.\nIt\u2019s a long-standing question. You may have heard that if you\u2019re underwater by your house, a flood damage insurance policy might not apply. But what about if your belongings were on top of your house?\nIf your house was underwater, and the flood happened when your belongings were on the top of your house, a flood insurance policy might cover your losses. If your house flooded and then dried up, your insurance policy might not cover your losses. But most policies cover losses after the water has stopped flowing.\nBut if your house flooded, and the bottom of the house was dry, your flood insurance policy might not provide protection for the losses. Your policy might only cover damage to your house\u2019s contents if the basement of your house flooded. In this case, if your belongings were on the roof, your flood insurance policy wouldn\u2019t cover your losses.","token_len":628,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2998,0.4341,0.0098,7.2101,0.0409,4.1891,2.6205,1.7641,1.8629,2.1149,1.5727,6.5272,4.4697,5.8394,0.0565,0.0003,0.0001,0.0001,3.2417,1.557,1.3384,1.2134,0.7109,2.5558,5.5416,0.3219,1.206,5.8729,2.574,1.5994,4.4055,3.4015,0.1049,0.7604,3.3843,4.0904,2.0845,2.3043,0.0005,0.0011,0.0005,4.9337,4.9358,0.1915,3.3571,2.8036,3.6953,1.9331,3.5705,2.8912,2.0069,1.5061,3.0003,4.3373,0.0948,5.8295,3.5232,1.906,0.0041,0.0014,0.0007,0.9295,1.1175,7.0037,1.4374,5.5208,0.3537,4.5635,22.8366,1.9447,0.8347,0.0036,9.3643,4.9694,5.5344,2.4166,2.5393,2.8758,2.5335,0.0005,0.0009,0.0009,5.7008,0.0094,0.0089,0.0011,0.1481,3.9853,4.611,7.3904,2.5723,3.6394,2.9375,3.4833,1.4825,2.4607,5.7411,10.7162,0.7567,3.0422,3.7341,0.8525,3.8016,6.8152,4.8553,0.8241,1.4844,7.7342,4.2214,0.112,4.6439,2.0194,8.4112,0.153,0.0107,2.5078,7.3903,2.8103,0.9417,4.5979,0.0753,9.5306,1.5256,4.1303,2.0223,2.3751,0.0986,0.3052,0.0987,21.9847,0.0289,3.8394,6.0477,0.027,0.0005,5.6588,1.8474,0.0013,3.2413,2.0224,0.0,1.0719,3.9561,6.9484,0.0629,0.1198,3.948,1.3704,0.1367,2.8289,1.372,5.7376,5.044,3.8258,2.9534,3.6385,2.9695,4.6419,5.7728,2.2939,3.8778,5.5709,0.417,4.1037,0.8175,2.3721,1.0786,1.1124,3.4352,6.569,6.0831,3.3486,2.2951,5.9422,3.0862,6.841,0.023,6.5096,1.5452,1.462,7.4064,0.6843,2.1317,2.2962,4.0689,1.2734,2.7399,0.3217,7.7796,2.989,3.7496,3.3803,0.1469,2.4046,4.3187,0.0011,4.9739,0.0001,0.0001,0.0,0.3532,0.5983,0.0034,0.0101,0.0212,2.8032,1.6131,0.0008,6.0089,0.0088,0.0001,0.0814,0.1004,0.0008,0.0012,0.0004,0.0043,0.0146,2.2217,1.9257,2.5501,17.2765,8.0815,3.4208,3.2318,1.2867,2.4173,2.7191,1.2561,3.7156,2.9668,5.3595,0.0818,3.3014,1.8675,1.8418,2.1757,1.0041,5.5724,0.4786,1.9201,2.351,3.782,0.0123,5.5239,2.9349,0.7663,0.6401,7.2213,0.002,3.5848,4.5687,0.0683,4.312,3.8074,0.0019,0.0821,3.3894,2.5958,0.8597,4.0544,2.3746,4.9101,8.4553,0.0205,3.1231,0.003,0.0021,0.387,0.1499,0.0015,0.1675,0.413,0.9407,1.8246,3.8441,2.4458,0.6766,0.0375,3.6182,2.9336,5.5944,1.1102,0.184,1.9258,2.2952,1.6767,1.7502,0.6413,0.3644,0.0722,7.7727,0.8793,5.3062,0.4531,0.6009,4.6293,4.8851,4.0355,0.0044,1.6732,2.42,4.2596,3.952,2.2508,0.0898,0.3745,0.5177,3.9255,3.8913,1.8563,2.6083,0.3717,0.497,0.6828,7.9206,10.1673,5.4718,3.6726,1.4909,0.7097,2.7,4.5642,3.9747,0.8034,6.1452,3.7983,1.8379,8.1742,6.7166,8.1093,1.567,4.4917,1.9814,3.0787,4.3588,1.833,0.5047,4.9845,5.4467,3.2956,0.9204,0.5785,2.3184,0.0801,3.716,2.4765,2.3621,3.9145,0.2659,0.0143,1.332,0.7279,0.401,2.1816,2.5059,2.1903,5.0687,0.0442,2.0432,0.5255,5.6548,8.2983,3.4066,4.4095,1.251,2.3293,0.0248,0.5744,2.529,5.9275,0.0267,1.2773,6.3385,0.8311,4.0493,1.565,1.8176,4.0681,1.3598,0.001,1.6009,2.1111,5.7575,1.0361,2.0826,3.5761,4.6237,4.0216,5.3663,0.2956,0.2811,2.0862,4.8649,0.2049,0.2984,3.183,0.7158,0.4464,1.9036,4.7519,1.7434,3.7144,0.4299,8.3468,4.1746,5.6175,0.8337,0.5501,5.4938,0.6216,4.8666,5.7008,9.8042,0.9611,0.3892,1.9361,2.474,4.9774,4.7626,5.7288,0.0135,2.3668,2.7609,1.085,0.3675,0.0083,0.1781,3.8695,1.118,2.5736,5.0098,4.9694,1.7208,0.6471,1.6801,0.8695,0.4814,1.3587,1.7694,0.2935,0.366,4.1956,11.3841,0.2045,0.0095,3.4627,3.9836,1.708,0.9138,5.6154,3.7379,8.8765,3.482,1.8746,0.988,1.8512,4.5839,1.8176,12.8084,1.4632,2.5275,12.4826,5.8295,5.0201,5.107,1.1661,3.5425,6.7071,5.9648,4.0377,0.7106,2.8949,1.8612,3.6054,0.9388,1.8945,4.1932,1.0182,1.7246,2.2848,8.7912,3.133,3.9124,3.5355,0.0248,0.8643,1.5995,1.8698,1.9018,3.8664,2.7351,2.1505,1.029,1.8945,1.3466,3.456,1.7769,2.4984,5.5873,4.864,1.8502,2.8508,0.1994,1.1117,3.1353,1.4245,0.3433,0.5268,0.1877,0.2142,4.2013,1.6778,0.2067,0.0488,0.5941,5.0886,2.0547,3.9996,0.8978,2.509,1.1811,1.2961,5.0286,1.7959,3.6992,7.1974,0.4264,0.6441,2.4327,0.9043,2.3776,0.994,1.9781,0.2234,1.0444,1.0388,0.3318,3.3533,6.3482,4.9547,2.3878,2.4828,4.7757,1.1428,2.5186,1.3592,3.3397,1.7067,0.8044,0.522,3.1558,1.3011,1.0071,1.1653,2.5973,2.0246,0.7,0.9094,8.2011,0.8383,1.0397,2.2286,1.2866,2.8018,0.7015,1.8202,4.3173,0.0448,0.1696,0.4017,1.808,6.5374,3.7864,1.706,2.2671,4.0072,0.9121,4.3463,2.4874,1.2034,4.3125,0.1628,3.9721,1.2841,0.9212,2.1792,10.1674,0.2557,0.1698,4.5596,1.7986,1.0917,7.8078,3.1977,0.6502,0.3415,3.9788,1.3652,4.3219,3.0846,0.4927,0.0499,3.076,1.0923,5.9059,0.358,0.6729,1.7896,3.8154,1.3774,1.0558,1.5396,0.0327,0.1337,4.2845,1.9826,0.572,0.1659,0.146,1.6799,0.2174,0.3254]}
{"prompt":"U.S .

Elizabeth Warren criticized Equifax for not doing enough to protect credit card users. (Photo: REUTERS\/Brian Snyder)\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Vermont Democrat and top rival of President Donald Trump, said:\n\"The fact that Equifax failed to protect consumers like me who trusted it to protect my credit score and secure my personal information is shameful. Equifax should have stopped the data breach years ago.\n\"The industry itself should take a lesson from this, and it will too if the industry stops using insecure banks like Citibank to process sensitive data. Such a company should simply be closed.\n\"Citibank itself, who processed the data in question, should also take a lesson from this and stop using financial services for a company who has been repeatedly found to be in violation in the handling of sensitive data.\"\nEquifax has long been criticized for not taking the necessary steps to protect its customers from data breaches, including one in which hackers exposed the personal information of 150 million U.S. tax filers from 1994 through 2014.\nThe bankruptcy of the company in 2017 was the first since the 1990's to result in a breach of consumer data.\n\"We have always known it was a big issue that needed fixing,\" Equifax CEO Brad Smith told NBC in November. \"But the past couple of years have been very tough,\" he added.\nThe company faced harsh criticism from both politicians and consumers, as some people were unable to renew their credit cards, or to check on their scores.\nU.S. regulators are expected to close a probe

Their","text":"Shaven-headed former jihadists filled a classroom in northern Syria as a Muslim cleric taught them a more moderate form of Islam than the version they had imposed in Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate. Their eyes gleamed, arms were raised and they shouted with one voice as they listened to Islamic teachings. They were not learning the teachings of a religion with a history of violence but rather a new religion with a history of non-violence and forgiveness, which they were told they would now embrace. A few months before, while living under Islamic State\u2019s tyranny, they had been branded terrorists and forced to wear the Islamic State headband or shackles. Now, the only place the shaven-headed men ever had a headband on was in their minds and these men, who had been raised in the west with respect and tolerance for every viewpoint, were beginning to understand the true face of what religion truly was. The video footage of his class had gone viral all over the world but, for the uninitiated, why he was teaching his class is not obvious. Why do such young, strong, successful men, some of whom have also had contact with mainstream religions, abandon their homes, culture and traditions to a foreign land and the beliefs of a radical organisation? What would they gain from it, aside from freedom to express themselves and what that could mean? Why are they, as men, willing to give up so much? What they were learning, though, was the Islamic State taught them that Islam was a religion of peace that included accepting others regardless of their background. There are a long history of non-Muslims adopting Islam, which gives further support to their claim that those in their midst were not acting alone. The question then becomes, if such a large number of people were willing to embrace a foreign religion, how are they expected to follow the teachings of Islam? Is not the main reason for converting away from Judaism, Christianity and a few other religions because their adherents cannot even find enough common ground with other religions to be happy with them? The history of Islam has always attracted believers, particularly the teachings that give the world at least a chance of peace in the way it exists, by accepting and understanding others. The fact that one of those converted to the ideology of Islamic State was British Muslim is a great concern as there are a lot of young British Muslims who think they are doing what is right while they are, in reality, putting themselves at great risk. It is important that they are aware that it is just as easy for extremist movements and terrorism to come into an area and start spreading their ideas as it is for foreign extremists to invade. Although the video shows the men from a classroom setting, there is no evidence that they were even studying any of the teachings, only that they were listening. They appear to be taking what they had heard in the classroom and incorporating it into their lives. Is it the teachers who should be apologetic for making this video, or is it the men? Who should be telling these young, educated young men that, in fact, they were going against what they believed in their hearts?","token_len":629,"entropy":[8.8947,3.6324,4.2729,8.5042,11.2011,8.7015,3.2502,5.7667,2.036,4.6657,1.2767,4.1423,2.8846,5.2156,3.6682,5.3111,1.6508,3.9312,6.7598,3.5166,2.7036,0.0026,0.5857,3.239,1.3396,5.993,2.2831,2.0207,9.4327,1.903,6.0959,2.2108,11.1905,8.9757,0.0586,1.2342,0.0879,0.512,5.9145,6.6752,4.5994,0.0119,2.6044,5.8971,4.0483,0.8828,1.2235,2.1969,3.9421,4.7977,5.4534,1.2467,3.7344,0.7913,4.6369,0.2738,4.0075,4.1696,0.8163,3.2903,1.5993,3.1752,7.0735,2.0227,3.4495,0.192,3.0047,2.8346,4.2502,2.0276,2.9808,0.4317,1.5124,3.9318,2.2068,2.1254,3.6854,2.7167,2.6053,0.9666,2.117,0.0937,6.1928,0.4374,0.3805,1.7292,7.0518,2.7812,3.4615,1.668,3.0528,3.6409,2.8744,2.1998,7.106,4.0098,0.4442,4.8778,2.8131,3.0194,2.5279,1.6905,5.7378,5.2246,3.069,2.9859,0.1243,15.6959,8.8786,2.9584,6.8397,0.5815,1.1245,1.4309,1.7783,7.2806,4.3298,1.5488,4.0894,0.1021,3.63,1.493,2.4612,1.9676,2.9212,3.4836,4.7531,9.1624,0.1242,0.6301,3.9207,1.0317,3.5964,5.0782,4.683,3.7497,6.0296,2.6698,0.3526,0.026,3.305,5.5802,3.6693,2.3524,4.9192,2.1404,4.6668,0.2687,0.9768,2.3605,6.7286,2.7345,7.1701,2.226,3.5162,2.2148,1.4826,1.591,4.6521,1.4987,1.6153,6.3503,4.5399,6.0005,1.887,3.4004,1.9604,6.798,6.3959,0.5607,0.9436,5.8835,0.044,2.7462,1.6179,3.5678,5.4297,0.0583,3.8116,5.7519,6.0652,1.9973,0.3175,2.678,6.7182,3.3527,1.4009,6.5585,6.3179,5.1986,3.6456,0.0089,6.8498,0.2221,0.2246,0.6489,4.7456,3.06,3.1507,1.4531,5.4301,0.0145,0.0007,0.0937,7.5124,4.8152,1.4262,4.9589,3.2707,1.6199,2.5023,2.16,4.2441,0.3494,5.3731,3.6183,4.8152,3.6503,4.3061,6.5313,1.6015,6.0181,1.6858,3.6134,5.6731,0.3748,0.2402,2.149,5.775,4.0405,6.863,0.0168,6.6665,5.7789,0.4324,8.0123,0.9832,4.8989,2.3389,6.8311,0.3586,3.3954,1.7356,5.6351,4.5267,2.7917,2.4474,5.3433,6.3722,0.9204,2.1008,4.4723,6.5673,1.5892,3.6594,5.0012,2.4553,5.5952,1.1764,2.9752,2.8416,7.7124,0.0197,6.3653,3.1985,4.2795,1.0192,1.4814,5.5063,6.0694,4.4843,0.4116,2.0975,3.3298,2.5913,0.7377,6.1575,2.2622,5.1634,0.6965,3.0443,0.0498,3.7654,0.3511,4.0335,0.5958,2.2345,2.8292,4.0352,4.3263,4.1993,2.2912,4.5352,0.3045,0.8671,3.243,4.7344,1.8257,6.4741,1.033,4.2364,3.5548,1.2827,1.599,1.9488,0.9396,0.9963,4.204,5.8489,7.4801,3.1821,4.8601,0.0047,0.4552,4.3398,1.695,4.7463,2.3209,3.4516,5.7165,2.439,0.054,5.006,0.0402,2.6117,6.7806,2.4866,2.2566,3.7661,6.5286,7.7347,3.5012,0.1241,2.5129,4.6196,1.0292,5.6388,4.0186,2.9707,2.4714,2.4416,2.4497,5.5509,4.0244,0.8337,2.1625,5.2363,3.1586,0.7135,1.1141,3.4286,4.1895,1.0864,5.5177,1.3625,0.1564,2.1732,2.144,2.3757,0.0379,3.163,2.0918,5.0735,0.606,0.8761,2.2944,4.6332,0.3475,5.0141,0.0193,3.8255,2.156,0.7581,0.2663,3.3171,1.5402,3.3988,4.9331,1.8465,6.9031,2.5057,1.9332,6.9352,6.696,0.192,7.6076,1.1217,0.9562,1.0111,7.0554,2.1978,0.3124,1.1663,5.7536,3.8158,7.2162,6.2277,5.964,3.5505,5.1648,6.6142,0.1319,1.0625,2.9624,1.8254,1.7594,2.4998,5.0349,1.2451,2.1722,0.474,2.4853,6.9146,0.0938,1.9454,2.8337,3.4836,6.7063,5.7219,2.0014,4.4028,2.9427,8.1672,4.4651,5.7886,2.3162,3.9438,7.7232,1.9312,1.6728,2.7654,1.2622,4.0323,3.5355,0.7021,7.1437,3.0686,6.9487,4.7396,5.3431,4.693,2.5669,3.7395,3.4654,1.3119,2.0581,3.7842,0.2169,4.9937,1.8904,3.1141,7.8584,1.6188,3.148,5.3341,0.4402,2.0302,0.1067,2.5929,7.9458,2.9979,3.3883,1.9097,3.9003,6.8611,4.1737,4.0603,1.0439,2.6029,1.4935,0.0786,3.9233,1.9095,0.3452,0.8664,5.3292,1.7788,0.9393,3.5226,3.6756,2.4651,0.2564,6.1508,2.594,0.6187,5.9205,1.4695,2.4451,0.0132,6.5075,1.6753,1.6433,3.3464,0.052,1.5231,2.9845,0.4552,3.2037,2.1894,2.8111,2.7977,2.3394,1.2704,3.6596,0.3559,5.4304,2.1682,3.5128,0.7234,5.8001,4.2093,3.4589,7.0427,0.2137,3.7779,2.3551,6.4889,1.7565,2.1157,4.2218,3.1579,2.7759,2.2555,3.5613,0.2348,0.0844,0.3604,6.489,2.4485,0.2495,7.1796,2.4315,5.9306,1.7672,3.934,3.1794,1.9403,2.6681,5.1252,3.6422,5.6232,5.476,4.5752,3.3932,0.695,0.9829,1.6443,0.8485,1.0972,1.0605,4.5611,6.314,4.0936,1.3749,0.4643,1.2698,4.076,3.5881,1.6285,0.3693,0.6136,5.3321,4.0356,2.9499,6.4101,0.2351,1.0178,4.2689,4.2729,0.7771,3.8076,2.2477,2.9837,1.3175,1.2851,0.8846,7.1082,0.485,0.2541,0.3668,2.9569,0.6163,4.2114,1.2288,3.8,5.0919,1.0521,5.4627,0.789,7.4935,1.9307,1.2946,5.7954,2.3851,1.9823,1.9705,1.1983,1.754,0.2392,0.5225,3.2266,3.4812,4.8756,1.8495,0.6633,5.4926,3.2385,1.0024,4.0833,4.7639,3.4686,0.2136,1.021,4.5739,2.3661,2.6175,0.0106,0.5842,2.1716,4.8385,5.2738,2.7058,0.7969,1.0111,0.8813,5.8134,2.4638,1.0559]}
{"prompt":"An EU agreement with Britain on relations after Brexit could serve as a model for ties with other countries that want to be as close as possible to the bloc but are not yet ready","text":"An EU agreement with Britain on relations after Brexit could serve as a model for ties with other countries that want to be as close as possible to the bloc but are not yet ready to fully join.\nThat was an unorthodox idea. Some were surprised it was even considered. As the agreement got closer, the more they began to understand the potential.\nThere will be free trade on a number of items. The UK will be able to choose which country to apply to. And for the time being, that will include countries in the European Economic Area, such as Ireland.\nSome details are yet to be worked out, such as the level of trade access that the various EU countries will have to Britain, and the exact way Brexit would have to happen.\nThis is an issue for a year long negotiation. It is not something that has an end date, and it will take months to reach an agreement. But the UK is prepared to go along with the EU\u2019s lead. Britain is not taking up the position that the UK isn\u2019t ready to be part of the European Economic Area \u2013 that is a fiction, and it\u2019s damaging to the British economy.\nWhat the countries within the European Economic Area want is access, for themselves, to the UK market, for a range of reasons. Ireland, for example, is reliant on the UK for its economic growth. It has benefited from free trade agreements with other countries. Britain is a significant trading partner for Ireland.\nWhat the agreement provides is for much closer access for European Economic Area citizens, as well as British nationals, to get into the EU market, something the US would also consider, to help with its economy. It gives British citizens greater access to the market of countries not members of the EU.\nThis is a positive outcome, not a negative outcome. It puts Britain in a stronger position to negotiate trade deals in the future.\nAs a result of the deal, there will be no formal customs controls between the UK and other EU countries. Instead, there will be fewer formal customs checks and more informal checks. That should make life easier for businesses.\nThe EU\u2019s current customs system is based on a paper check, which takes time and costs money. This will remain in place until the new customs system is fully operational and fully tested.\nOn the customs frontier between the UK and EU, there will be checks by customs staff but less paperwork and more checks on goods entering or leaving the boundary post-Brexit. (That is the most likely outcome of the negotiations, despite Brexit Secretary David Davis\u2019 claim that the UK would implement \u201cno border\u201d trading). This would help to speed up the process, though some UK businesses may not immediately welcome it.\nA system for customs staff to take a digital photo of goods as they enter the UK, rather than on paper, is also under consideration, and will be finalised if it is shown to work well.\nThe EU is an economically and politically vital block. A good relation with Britain will not be easy. But it is the right thing to do.","token_len":629,"entropy":[9.3252,7.0759,2.99,4.091,2.2173,7.7537,7.7808,0.5438,2.4391,7.7535,0.3533,0.4084,3.107,0.1728,10.0323,2.5714,1.415,3.4317,2.7608,1.9074,0.3419,3.5527,5.0082,0.8749,0.4928,0.0673,0.1851,0.8092,1.2985,4.4108,2.6234,2.4619,2.1843,1.7763,0.2559,5.2668,2.8266,1.0804,0.3142,17.7082,4.4878,4.4644,8.9499,2.8984,2.9777,4.202,4.5334,4.0387,4.5554,1.2921,2.8901,2.535,1.3709,5.7042,1.9158,7.9406,5.6137,0.9917,0.6291,2.0002,5.7388,4.0532,4.2362,0.3303,3.4109,1.9411,3.5553,4.69,0.5306,4.8036,4.3641,0.4109,8.1673,0.8569,4.7841,2.4823,2.2611,0.0035,4.5357,2.4757,2.0352,2.2343,1.4108,1.8187,0.9684,0.0505,5.0873,2.5591,4.6915,1.3116,5.1342,1.9462,2.8872,3.595,4.5465,1.8158,4.7539,0.0061,0.282,3.0878,1.3132,4.13,4.2766,3.1951,0.563,1.8985,0.7696,0.005,1.3796,1.5063,0.002,2.8498,1.5255,0.4143,4.0925,6.9828,2.1364,3.3808,0.0137,0.127,2.2958,0.003,1.106,2.7214,0.002,1.7708,4.1823,0.0713,3.7637,5.5867,2.2947,2.6198,7.3237,1.5089,1.6346,1.5689,0.9461,1.0107,5.7014,2.5131,2.0812,1.2035,5.0316,5.857,6.1521,2.3175,5.1246,0.3629,4.0518,0.2736,0.7345,4.4205,1.3962,3.0558,2.9347,2.6129,3.0392,5.6897,7.1975,2.8493,1.1489,2.4757,1.2371,2.2578,2.6409,0.7112,2.4565,6.2273,3.0348,1.6109,2.0286,1.9086,1.6594,1.9063,1.5714,3.3635,1.301,3.4895,1.3365,0.0913,0.3191,2.0157,2.2866,3.1113,1.741,4.8332,0.2554,3.6893,2.5228,0.7027,1.2923,1.7887,14.101,6.7855,5.8904,7.3313,1.8672,5.5439,1.7368,2.6923,5.6336,3.8874,1.1279,4.16,0.8107,2.0995,1.782,5.9627,10.1882,0.469,0.1191,1.0261,0.2457,2.4434,1.286,0.0066,0.6133,3.468,2.5029,0.0753,5.6143,2.3906,1.3192,2.192,6.7262,2.5859,1.1662,1.8883,9.7914,0.0248,0.0631,7.4507,0.6952,0.7866,3.4232,0.8372,0.4883,0.3353,4.2864,2.7151,7.8238,7.7348,0.196,1.8865,0.3557,0.0105,2.1373,0.848,3.8418,4.1961,3.8027,6.5361,1.5077,0.1931,0.6965,3.9497,2.0584,1.746,3.5815,3.8296,3.0319,0.0017,2.689,0.5002,7.2379,1.8655,0.915,0.3905,0.0227,1.4102,9.1044,0.062,0.9639,1.681,0.9996,1.1753,5.2481,1.9202,0.8971,2.3987,2.1553,5.9058,0.5384,4.0405,0.3273,1.7406,1.2111,1.4723,1.2316,1.7565,4.0168,1.6236,2.4327,4.5348,3.4522,0.0146,2.1481,1.5829,0.8848,0.9636,4.1651,1.2595,5.6639,4.4216,0.8126,3.4339,7.2129,4.4924,3.7415,2.3178,5.0534,6.9388,0.1108,4.9875,1.8778,2.7691,0.4941,0.0796,5.4217,2.5087,1.379,0.4159,5.6813,3.1656,0.745,1.6691,2.3455,2.0921,6.0845,2.1344,4.025,4.1245,5.6549,4.7011,2.4527,4.631,2.9923,3.8458,2.4036,3.3636,0.3424,3.1919,4.0308,3.1262,0.6629,3.7547,0.9907,0.1687,0.8191,3.0905,4.6905,4.6586,5.1414,5.9282,0.0613,0.0482,0.6053,0.8891,0.4905,2.7279,0.8229,1.4476,4.368,3.5588,1.9419,3.9859,2.1258,1.2556,3.946,0.4436,1.9884,5.3649,1.6992,1.0233,0.6422,2.6873,0.1108,0.6628,3.8257,4.3928,0.7668,3.4596,0.7979,1.2408,0.6678,1.1332,4.7321,2.3062,0.8168,1.3573,1.0216,2.0909,0.2435,2.8567,0.7853,0.1627,2.306,5.5805,6.4954,4.5927,4.4765,0.4625,0.6481,0.0394,2.229,0.4799,0.6783,0.7325,3.855,0.1448,2.4096,0.1739,0.052,6.5711,6.0163,2.1364,0.7149,2.5427,2.6105,4.3337,2.7918,1.2392,3.2158,5.0072,2.315,5.8501,0.4863,0.0926,3.521,1.9685,0.4023,1.7529,2.6942,7.5129,0.0457,0.0178,4.7507,2.1842,1.7495,0.9728,2.9315,0.0685,1.6233,6.9241,5.271,1.6174,1.2738,4.6435,3.6171,1.5247,4.2366,1.3916,0.6123,2.9336,3.4941,6.3704,1.5445,0.2437,1.1868,1.2397,2.2672,2.8163,0.9716,0.275,2.1196,1.949,2.8266,3.0527,6.0336,0.4009,0.8424,5.5764,0.9421,4.821,6.6115,3.8051,0.3655,0.4458,0.0269,2.3174,0.2692,1.2127,0.6172,0.1774,5.4531,3.8571,2.6728,4.8352,6.3841,5.9062,5.2202,2.1941,1.6925,3.1294,2.5717,2.5193,3.6044,3.8033,0.1101,0.2068,11.6164,6.8684,5.5274,0.4115,0.0962,6.6645,4.0337,1.2063,2.7571,4.6815,4.7202,1.9683,1.7956,0.3939,3.6572,1.7128,5.4583,3.8765,9.2504,0.0668,0.0024,3.9087,0.0415,9.7184,0.6436,1.4913,0.972,1.5296,7.2023,11.5332,4.9841,5.3534,3.8441,6.9388,6.9052,10.0129,3.2344,3.6842,2.7422,3.0125,1.7679,3.7656,0.1731,0.6295,0.9133,2.1267,5.2783,3.5915,5.4861,1.0075,2.2362,1.6108,6.8603,5.8339,1.8844,0.294,0.2325,4.0408,4.9346,3.368,2.7119,6.4096,1.8072,3.9671,3.0402,7.2211,2.5108,0.5798,0.9075,5.3531,0.2487,1.0807,0.9404,1.2324,2.4789,2.9603,0.004,5.3738,2.2832,0.4827,1.7098,2.2063,3.926,0.8682,2.1412,2.1968,2.2569,1.6263,7.7491,0.0073,5.755,2.3265,0.3551,7.114,0.7852,5.0098,2.6117,0.6811,0.6265,1.6227,2.8769,2.1922,4.748,5.9328,3.1587,1.2499,6.2386,8.0911,2.0828,4.293,4.1015,10.5908,0.8681,2.4268,2.2847,3.1984,1.3943,2.3919,1.1785,2.3827,1.2775,0.7952,3.2189,2.2398,0.5045,0.1001,0.0122,0.5831]}
{"prompt":"Democratic lawmakers are investigating whether retired U.S. General Michael Flynn secretly promoted a U.S.-Russian project to build dozens of nuclear reactors in the Middle East after becoming President Donald Trump \u2019 s first national security","text":"Democratic lawmakers are investigating whether retired U.S. General Michael Flynn secretly promoted a U.S.-Russian project to build dozens of nuclear reactors in the Middle East after becoming President Donald Trump \u2019 s first national security adviser. According to the House\u2019s intelligence committee, Flynn has kept a confidentiality agreement with the agency that he signed before joining the Trump campaign and before the new president was sworn in, according to a new report. The House Intelligence Committee has said that they will soon release details of the classified report, which is titled \u201cProject North,\u201d and is considered by the committee as the most sensitive intelligence briefing in its history. Flynn, who left the post last March, did not directly testify about the report. A House intelligence committee source said, \u201cWe are very confident that he will come to the Capitol to testify today.\u201d Flynn is one of the few people who have actually seen the classified memo, as he did not testify, but other members of the Trump administration including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, President Trump \u2019 s national security adviser, and several other officials have stated they also have the memo. \u201cThis report details the Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to engage in a broader, more ambitious attempt to create or influence an alliance with Russia that would have the potential to dramatically change U.S.-Russian policy,\u201d according to an anonymous intelligence official quoted in the new report. A leaked document published by WikiLeaks in October detailed U.S. intelligence reports that Trump was in constant communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin during campaigning. Trump \u2019 s allies have said that they are skeptical that Flynn acted inappropriately. However, the White House has yet to comment on the report. According to a source close to the intelligence committee, \u201cWhen the intelligence committee will review the report, it will be a critical review because there will be questions raised.\u201d \u201cThis investigation is about whether the President was wrong for choosing Michael Flynn as U.S. national security adviser and, by implication, wrong for dismissing Michael Flynn as national security adviser, or whether he was right in both instances,\u201d said a source close to the Intelligence Committee. The source said, \u201cI know in my mind he is acting legally.\u201d The intelligence report documents that former U.N. Ambassador and Flynn confidante Kelly Craft worked hard to help raise the profile of the project, despite the fact that it was unfinished and a secret. In the classified memo, Flynn also referred to his relationship with President-elect Trump as the best relationship he had ever had and stated that no other person had ever treated him better than the president-elect. Flynn also allegedly had several interactions with Trump \u2019 s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, including after the President-elect had been elected. U.S. intelligence officials have said they believe that Flynn, who is currently in prison for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, lied to the intelligence committee about meetings he had with foreign officials and about a conversation he had with the Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe.","token_len":630,"entropy":[9.3244,2.5853,5.8668,1.2277,9.6716,2.5513,0.0047,0.0025,0.0007,6.4885,2.4194,0.2458,7.9984,6.2292,2.9705,5.7955,0.0001,0.0081,1.6142,1.7395,6.517,1.0811,3.2284,9.0434,0.003,3.21,1.4739,1.252,2.0223,2.1643,0.0089,5.1366,5.002,4.0103,0.7884,0.0044,18.5768,7.42,8.9079,3.7892,1.0838,0.0097,0.1661,0.2149,5.5093,0.001,1.7199,3.2651,15.0544,3.0638,0.6649,4.4809,0.3825,0.2067,0.6241,4.0206,6.834,1.4584,7.9884,0.1368,0.4612,0.9845,7.1873,1.3248,3.3437,5.5722,4.2277,2.8,0.3374,0.5755,1.1991,2.4747,4.7048,3.339,5.4308,2.1326,2.6176,1.062,0.1599,2.6807,3.7044,0.0014,1.7766,3.8478,0.5567,0.8227,1.9608,2.8737,1.205,0.1105,2.0881,4.2116,1.5201,5.8276,2.9526,5.4442,2.9382,3.866,0.7162,1.1395,4.5098,3.0426,1.9941,0.7917,1.7428,6.0594,6.4281,5.4542,7.3393,5.5453,7.6329,1.0759,8.4678,1.7313,2.2395,5.2848,2.6097,1.6154,0.8627,3.4669,2.0754,1.271,1.8979,2.9506,5.6473,1.7358,2.7653,0.2145,0.2046,3.8733,2.7897,0.6402,4.3284,0.3361,3.8432,2.8795,4.3919,0.6025,3.9764,0.0834,4.6244,4.2913,2.8371,0.4546,3.576,1.6743,3.611,3.1195,2.9962,0.5316,2.1276,1.4731,3.1421,3.6327,1.104,4.9004,1.6416,3.9211,2.207,0.4904,2.6734,2.2921,4.7482,1.7666,0.9789,5.8373,1.9455,0.4115,4.4124,1.6761,1.19,2.8504,6.6911,2.4706,3.9751,0.0107,1.3311,2.2915,1.9394,1.1179,2.668,5.1017,4.4212,0.8016,1.27,5.6573,1.6193,4.2572,2.7029,2.7781,1.6611,3.6978,3.1798,2.1999,5.3803,2.2544,0.1629,0.4993,2.9011,1.6137,5.8338,4.0792,1.9335,0.1677,0.001,0.0014,0.0007,0.7578,0.003,1.0564,5.334,0.8988,7.5097,0.2899,0.1437,2.3322,0.0051,0.0946,0.7421,1.6602,5.1827,1.5562,2.2646,1.3304,6.4526,2.6375,6.3301,2.909,4.8597,2.8145,0.6352,4.1508,0.5244,4.2414,2.8329,6.9811,1.3892,4.6813,1.0619,5.9857,0.6424,0.2241,3.3076,0.0728,5.2822,0.7649,1.5679,4.9912,2.8669,1.9468,5.9733,5.7521,0.1625,4.1373,5.4153,6.9576,2.4916,5.2321,1.6226,0.2167,2.7129,1.1974,4.0992,2.5202,1.1101,0.0678,5.3128,2.6213,1.4111,0.0009,0.0013,0.6073,0.8887,5.938,2.1286,3.4186,1.0819,2.9796,0.003,4.0123,3.2607,3.6705,1.2104,6.4363,0.623,0.2308,4.3799,0.231,0.2162,3.9112,7.0907,2.8381,4.5505,0.7467,1.5018,2.8709,2.957,5.268,4.4789,0.0005,0.0019,0.5719,2.2249,4.2525,1.4747,5.4947,2.6439,3.8557,5.2738,1.2728,0.0625,0.7842,2.171,0.0328,0.003,3.0071,10.1191,2.3674,2.8651,2.6274,0.0873,0.0384,4.7742,2.6569,2.312,0.7572,2.9507,2.7319,5.333,1.3023,2.463,4.6265,2.982,2.05,3.5441,0.0083,1.5366,3.3885,0.0009,1.0735,5.6285,0.0007,2.5716,0.4486,0.5585,1.3182,0.7672,4.4503,0.0015,1.5797,2.0231,2.2006,0.0013,0.3568,3.7106,0.7621,0.1549,3.8785,0.1922,5.4692,2.2993,2.8375,0.9694,6.3983,3.5676,0.6606,1.487,0.6536,1.519,0.2344,1.5601,3.6365,3.3971,3.8319,5.0378,3.5878,1.9197,0.1338,3.6309,2.6987,4.4834,1.0454,0.6818,3.3716,0.2569,3.5152,4.5503,1.2668,3.7437,2.5967,1.5421,2.8519,3.1126,6.4183,4.9584,4.7978,4.1451,0.0036,1.2366,4.9801,0.0006,0.0008,0.0124,0.4165,0.0046,0.156,2.0209,4.2784,4.5456,2.8076,0.0201,8.5486,0.1597,7.9321,3.4389,0.0028,0.5877,1.423,0.0014,0.1521,2.6595,4.7164,1.0904,1.0533,1.3198,2.6718,3.255,5.8718,3.9497,2.9171,0.9011,0.5703,4.0164,1.828,0.5259,1.0249,0.0025,0.0403,2.9135,0.0802,0.3505,1.3223,0.8924,1.0779,2.3003,0.2421,0.1009,3.8092,4.299,5.5707,2.4748,3.0013,4.1144,2.7974,4.984,6.6434,2.3198,0.4577,0.3659,2.0307,2.7513,3.569,5.2976,1.195,6.2323,2.9945,0.0005,7.1155,0.0135,0.3887,4.7708,6.3035,3.2309,1.1687,9.7705,9.5215,6.2064,5.5011,0.358,3.5201,5.9318,1.6426,2.2718,0.0401,1.2993,1.2005,1.4231,6.4206,1.5092,0.5013,0.0495,2.2525,0.5245,7.8258,1.3449,4.865,5.0764,1.5228,3.1861,2.3839,4.9178,1.8485,0.2601,2.4311,4.7166,5.3812,0.0524,3.3804,4.063,0.0212,3.9657,3.6702,0.0663,0.8296,0.8446,4.1223,3.3546,2.8647,0.7216,0.4841,1.3848,0.1169,3.0105,3.7136,0.514,6.5047,3.1956,2.0922,2.1319,0.9844,5.395,0.1616,3.3724,0.5825,3.0467,1.7529,1.3937,0.0022,0.381,3.1636,1.902,5.5039,3.9413,5.0069,4.204,0.0634,3.3552,5.1354,0.051,0.2015,3.147,0.1187,0.0021,0.0031,0.0043,2.0415,0.3596,0.0015,0.7337,6.0147,6.0547,1.332,3.6984,0.3493,0.0364,3.3951,3.5364,1.5765,1.3633,6.3116,0.0019,0.0725,0.0076,0.7539,1.067,1.0872,1.1266,2.38,0.9212,0.5712,1.5377,3.8171,0.6424,2.0342,2.8764,2.4241,5.8684,1.7008,2.0644,0.4578,0.411,0.2728,0.4338,0.4012,1.6298,0.0593,1.6663,0.5733,0.1257,0.0006,0.4508,4.1969,0.7663,0.7119,6.117,1.2412,1.0534,4.7647,0.7949,0.2028,0.1632,5.1149,0.5989,2.559,3.3403,4.0439,2.8786,0.4444,0.0615,0.0678,2.2731,6.2636,0.032,0.0472,0.0002,6.0942,10.7067,1.8483,1.4066]}
{"prompt":"Arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of Islamic State , an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said","text":"Arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of Islamic State, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said in August, noting the number of Syrian government mortar shells and Iranian-made long-range missiles, as well as U.S. and Saudi-made weapons, found on the field. Syria, which was a major center of the ancient civilization known as the Mesopotamia, has been in constant turmoil since 2011. Since then, the conflict has claimed a toll of at least 91,000 lives and forced more than 12 million Syrians from their homes, according to the United Nations.\n\u201cThere is something going on up there. I heard it from the first two and I kept hearing them out of the corner of my eye,\u201d he told reporters Thursday at a press briefing. But after watching more closely, he said, he couldn\u2019t see anything unusual on the video.\nThe Pentagon said Thursday that \u201ccurrently\u201d the most consistent reason for the flights is to conduct surveillance. The US has been sending aircraft over Iraq to monitor weapons caches since Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion in 2003.\nIn the past few weeks, there have been two unidentified drones in close proximity in Iraq that were believed to be surveillance drones at first but the Pentagon announced that they most likely were part of an experimental missile defense in Iraq operation on Tuesday.\nThe drones were \u201clikely\u201d military aircraft, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters in his briefing. But on Thursday, the US was still waiting on confirmation that the video of their apparent maneuvers above Mosul was legitimate or some sort of a false flag.\nThere was no immediate confirmation from Baghdad on Thursday but officials have long told Reuters and others that the military is being trained to spot the drones.\nA drone was recorded flying overhead of the Syrian capital Damascus after a raid earlier Saturday by the Russian military with the air support of its forces.\nThe Syrian military said the Russian military used a plane to carry \u201cdetonating grenades\u201d from Syria to Turkey, citing local media.\nA Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Friday the Syrian government \u201cwill pay any price for any Israeli aggression\u201d and had \u201cno choice but to respond.\u201d\nTurkey, which has long supported the Syrian government, said after the raid that it had captured Syrian troops after the raid, adding that two weapons caches were discovered.\nThe strike was the first such strike on a Syrian ground and air force facility since the Islamic State\u2019s takeover of large parts of Syria in June. It was a step in efforts to reduce the Islamic State\u2019s supply lines and protect its own troops after a year of fighting.\nWhile the focus thus far has been on Iraq, the Pentagon has not ruled out other targets in Syria, Cook said Thursday, noting it does have air support capabilities.\nThe strike had long been expected, given the heavy weaponry that the Islamic State had managed to capture in the past year, said Peter Alexander, a security expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.","token_len":630,"entropy":[7.4003,9.4279,0.8782,1.5657,3.3343,0.2108,2.4811,5.0591,0.0167,2.5145,5.0514,3.0508,0.6843,9.6128,8.0862,0.0487,1.0984,0.9825,0.0748,0.0022,4.3479,0.3156,1.8315,3.3873,8.4369,9.16,0.2069,1.7718,8.0033,3.7711,3.9781,2.3134,1.2653,1.6916,6.0918,2.8943,3.5648,3.5785,5.7126,2.6838,3.9365,0.2197,2.5886,3.0986,8.6512,1.6651,2.1552,9.0186,0.5209,0.2879,6.05,0.0469,0.0515,0.8181,3.8447,1.7933,0.0044,0.0051,4.8007,0.0047,0.0161,0.4895,1.1923,0.9495,1.774,0.3945,3.6957,1.5179,7.124,1.057,0.6368,6.3452,0.6603,5.6407,3.0366,1.81,3.3072,3.5987,2.2206,7.0365,0.3513,1.188,9.3538,5.4545,4.9935,0.1565,0.6759,4.9219,0.0108,1.4245,0.4068,1.6782,1.4071,3.2083,5.6521,3.6172,0.5369,2.7348,1.7106,5.1414,1.0892,0.1259,1.2225,2.4707,0.1086,3.2359,4.0062,5.9483,0.0496,2.2029,0.0,7.4005,0.3465,0.1275,0.2024,1.2515,3.7724,1.4956,0.0025,5.2024,0.242,2.3311,2.8088,0.0167,0.0088,1.9137,1.352,0.001,0.772,0.7903,0.0539,0.187,1.1673,16.8416,8.4298,9.3898,1.3484,6.7424,5.0952,0.0684,7.5839,0.343,1.6878,2.579,4.9958,2.7689,2.2904,2.3998,5.3692,4.3049,4.9247,2.1198,6.4618,1.8057,6.1039,5.8974,2.2881,1.3267,2.0556,0.0134,0.0258,0.0567,2.0017,10.9085,7.7837,5.3989,2.705,4.02,4.5157,3.0882,1.1006,2.3795,2.2287,1.2676,4.0183,4.3924,4.048,4.9743,5.4674,0.3554,0.5915,0.5215,0.3612,1.3296,3.2894,10.389,9.973,0.0143,2.7917,1.4488,3.4307,5.0565,0.3982,7.7841,0.617,0.7865,4.4216,4.3895,1.66,1.8589,0.4833,10.0991,1.5632,7.9151,2.2397,4.6481,1.2389,5.6469,6.0433,6.2971,0.4009,0.6446,10.7468,2.5005,3.3476,4.7135,3.4287,3.3804,1.9035,4.9956,1.7808,1.8897,4.039,3.5625,3.1116,3.4728,2.372,0.9167,3.9916,2.9111,5.878,8.6669,0.044,7.0852,2.333,1.3993,1.518,1.428,0.582,0.7784,1.2557,3.6875,2.0315,1.7741,2.481,1.146,0.0599,4.3621,0.5703,0.0485,3.156,8.238,5.2301,3.1429,5.9911,0.2387,4.8656,2.0516,2.1013,2.6597,6.2463,0.0267,0.7433,6.5858,1.2459,5.4478,5.6649,3.2927,4.8932,1.8675,5.3839,2.5654,1.4196,10.6085,0.0637,0.8498,5.129,0.0022,1.4309,6.9661,4.7362,1.9971,7.7796,1.3641,9.2532,5.7056,3.2059,0.4548,0.8847,1.7221,3.1846,1.4367,12.5119,0.6364,4.9492,1.696,1.0026,6.7604,2.9777,1.9066,5.7799,0.6577,2.3802,0.011,1.4352,0.0909,2.8004,4.7196,1.6808,0.5516,3.1466,5.0406,1.1262,0.2205,1.3387,2.6624,4.3449,3.0442,5.2354,2.2479,4.6031,1.6749,1.0444,7.0041,3.394,3.9891,8.0881,6.622,9.0041,4.6395,0.8711,4.9751,4.4104,6.7608,1.8051,0.0271,4.8135,5.0364,0.1012,1.0343,0.449,4.9716,1.6209,0.9845,1.1118,2.6797,1.8561,3.3006,3.215,1.2728,4.5237,3.277,3.5362,5.3123,4.8979,3.3153,4.4007,3.0326,0.1467,0.7717,4.2318,2.3241,5.7627,3.7687,1.1851,3.2215,3.0156,1.0575,1.5405,0.8057,3.8923,5.0302,3.0894,7.6898,2.5551,3.0431,3.5816,1.5005,3.6074,4.4091,4.5139,4.3697,2.1735,5.2469,4.7003,6.0408,2.2075,1.3057,3.8959,2.2959,5.3933,1.6371,5.601,3.135,0.1386,5.3082,6.5309,1.0084,1.501,1.7283,2.535,1.5128,1.266,1.7891,2.7116,2.3649,4.9725,1.8457,6.2403,1.907,3.5542,14.0364,0.065,5.4471,1.5901,2.0619,7.3283,3.1538,4.9121,3.6537,3.9973,1.1738,3.2238,1.7148,7.0331,5.3451,3.2638,2.6243,1.1629,3.4542,2.0778,6.6644,0.0735,2.7651,1.001,4.5578,2.4914,1.7997,1.6955,7.6242,0.2407,4.9082,6.6329,3.2279,2.489,1.58,2.2871,7.6776,4.4781,2.7183,2.3056,1.7457,5.5504,7.6948,0.2542,2.206,3.3771,0.1812,0.0118,2.7558,1.1459,6.2177,3.3459,0.4545,4.5056,2.0987,1.0693,1.1259,2.7458,2.1641,1.1509,0.4573,0.8879,0.6494,2.3823,5.8846,0.9386,1.5531,0.4189,0.5938,1.6683,5.3159,4.349,3.9917,4.6478,1.7781,2.5362,1.8828,3.6943,0.2285,6.7635,6.8056,0.9449,1.2232,4.1053,2.9975,0.6885,1.8373,6.0193,1.9181,1.5254,1.3442,3.1801,2.2172,1.7376,1.4204,0.6377,5.8122,5.4539,1.1549,3.5577,5.3023,0.9544,1.1824,4.1545,0.0036,10.0724,1.4528,0.0308,3.249,0.2361,2.5307,1.004,0.0009,1.6656,0.595,2.0504,0.8226,3.4812,1.6392,3.3819,5.3146,1.5172,5.4451,0.4773,4.791,0.6611,2.4696,0.0048,2.593,0.0399,0.0095,5.2404,1.5398,1.969,6.4845,1.5876,4.2888,4.3032,5.3018,2.3344,3.859,0.1934,1.8086,0.7787,0.5397,5.2905,1.11,7.442,8.8901,0.0228,0.8797,0.17,0.3015,4.1827,0.3956,1.2685,3.0691,1.3406,4.2437,2.7561,0.0213,3.0663,2.4788,1.1681,0.6423,1.4606,9.4183,0.1977,3.9888,2.1869,2.4327,3.9672,4.6051,2.501,3.9774,2.3648,6.2906,1.5989,0.3981,1.959,4.1385,4.9518,7.734,0.1937,2.7221,1.5472,4.7229,0.6462,5.0364,2.8571,2.379,1.3194,0.3539,0.0023,2.1345,6.0978,0.0181,3.9752,1.3662,1.9306,1.5751,2.8444,1.4255,3.0433,5.4314,7.8786,0.0855,0.7394,4.7335,1.2577,0.3542,0.3772,6.3198,0.3606,0.0317,0.0183,0.0062,0.677]}
{"prompt":"The Islamist group Hamas urged Palestinians on Thursday to abandon peace efforts and launch a new uprising against Israel in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as its capital . Palestinian","text":"The Islamist group Hamas urged Palestinians on Thursday to abandon peace efforts and launch a new uprising against Israel in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said any peace talks with Israel would end in a new war.\n\u201cWe are calling Palestinians to move to a new movement to put pressure on Israel and the U.S. and other countries,\u201d the Hamas statement quoted Ahmed Zahar, its political director, as saying. Zahar, however, spoke to Arabic-language TV channels following the U.K., U.S. and French declarations, which he said were \u201ccounterproductive for peace and security efforts,\u201d according to Haaretz.\nThe Palestinian Authority responded to Trump s announcement with an immediate move to send a delegation to Jerusalem to meet with senior U.S., Israeli and Jordanian officials. Palestinian sources said the group would meet with some U.S. senators, in particular those whose votes were most critical of Trump, in preparation for meeting with senior Trump administrations officials and members of Congress.\n\u201cI would like to thank Palestinian National Liberation Organization President Mahmoud Abbas for the warm reception as we arrived in Jerusalem this morning to visit the headquarters of the United States Embassy,\u201d said U.S. Representative Peter King (D-NY), who traveled with the delegation. King and U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) met with Palestinian officials at the U.S Embassy. The Americans urged the Palestinians to engage in a peace process with the Israelis.\nPrime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is said to have accepted the proposal. Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Thursday that the Palestinians \u201casked for time to gather the necessary conditions for initiating the discussions\u201d with the Israeli government.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s weekend remark about a scaled-back tax cut for corporations sparked behind-the-scenes debate in the U.S. Congress , with a White House aide trying on Thursday to minimize the impact of","text":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s weekend remark about a scaled-back tax cut for corporations sparked behind-the-scenes debate in the U.S. Congress, with a White House aide trying on Thursday to minimize the impact of his outburst. \u201cIt\u2019s a very controversial opinion. That\u2019s what he said,\u201d Trump said of imposing a 10 percent tax on large US corporations. The White House was quick to dismiss the remark, saying it was meant only as a humorous statement. \u201cThe tax rate is supposed to rise again soon,\u201d Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff, told conservative radio host Andrew Napolitano. But Bannon has said he thinks Trump, not Bannon, might be responsible for any misunderstanding.\nIn an apparent reference to his comments, Trump said at a campaign rally before the election that he would lower the corporate tax rate for \u201cbig companies to around three tenths, maybe slightly less. It will happen.\u201d\nTrump said the comment was meant in a joke and that a scaled-back tax cut for corporations would generate many millions of jobs. Trump said it could happen in mid-November, a mere few days after he takes office.\nThe president has made no secret of his desire to cut taxes for corporations. Two days before his election, he appeared on CNBC and suggested eliminating the corporate tax rate altogether. The proposal would bring down the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nA third reduction of 15 percent in 2020 would bring the corporate tax rate down to 10 percent, while a fourth reduction to 6.25 percent would apply in 2021. In the end, Trump and his Republican allies failed to muster enough support for their corporate tax proposal in Congress. The proposal was deemed too costly \u2014 though the figure depends on the estimates of its effects, which vary widely \u2014 and the Trump administration would not push it any further after the election.\nIn the meantime in May, Trump and the Republican Party proposed a temporary tax cut that was designed to have the same effects as a permanent tax cut while leaving the corporate tax rate intact. Republican tax hawks wanted a tax cut that would make companies as much as $7 billion (EUR5 billion) more profitable over a 10-year period.\nLast week, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, suggested he thought a permanent tax cut would be possible. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a lot of paper,\u201d Manafort told journalists.\nTrump\u2019s campaign team reportedly suggested Trump himself should announce a corporate tax cut and said Trump\u2019s advisers are currently working on how to announce the tax cut, but the move still remains a highly speculative.\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal story last week, some in Trump\u2019s own camp doubt whether a tax cut from a small business tax rate would really make much difference, with some saying a smaller business tax cut would actually hurt small businesses that otherwise would have received a rebate from the tax cut. Trump campaign advisers have been meeting behind closed doors to discuss the idea of a tax cut.","token_len":631,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,11.7229,8.1085,7.4978,10.6094,6.982,2.0228,3.155,13.1738,0.6545,1.6365,5.5092,0.9929,0.4863,2.624,8.3923,11.483,2.5849,0.1072,0.02,0.0099,3.9248,2.2342,1.3881,3.0218,0.0004,0.0125,0.1008,1.8802,2.0471,2.1315,3.8632,3.9602,0.0003,2.2024,5.4717,6.5397,4.0402,0.0393,6.6257,0.8131,1.8838,0.6681,2.6472,6.5936,0.4765,6.3817,3.9198,7.3094,5.7073,4.2209,0.7652,2.0111,3.063,5.603,6.6759,2.2811,4.571,2.9932,0.9497,0.6895,1.6781,2.5966,0.7004,2.1531,3.8868,7.5777,6.2517,1.2148,5.3698,9.5712,0.6843,3.6427,0.3884,0.6594,0.5058,5.3398,8.9684,0.2869,1.1026,2.9762,3.8332,0.0006,4.0543,1.3674,0.0139,3.7884,0.7145,2.3314,1.1336,1.0267,1.1782,0.3892,4.0013,3.8137,1.963,0.5079,5.7676,3.857,1.103,2.6267,0.5044,2.2248,4.0729,3.4116,1.2943,5.2226,0.0026,6.1245,6.0182,4.4107,1.0717,1.5913,1.2223,9.3703,0.4599,0.9175,1.8775,4.2316,0.2847,0.4954,2.6386,0.0012,0.7116,2.0557,0.003,0.1641,1.3915,6.8399,1.0924,0.1661,7.0029,0.4134,0.0008,0.0,1.3804,3.5643,3.8701,3.9063,2.1306,1.6631,4.3988,1.8882,5.3891,3.7194,2.9928,0.0534,5.4292,1.4225,4.9102,0.1924,4.5834,8.4567,0.6903,1.6684,10.4015,1.9244,4.2771,2.2689,0.0181,2.6758,2.3466,1.5656,0.9626,1.2101,4.5215,0.5706,2.4198,0.4786,7.0406,0.9883,2.7591,0.4752,0.8992,1.3093,3.8365,0.5129,0.7154,0.5321,0.018,3.6501,16.2617,0.9499,6.9222,2.6033,2.2843,5.6686,7.9869,6.4572,0.0033,4.8647,7.1211,5.1022,2.84,0.8398,4.5329,4.5678,4.5113,1.9797,4.4742,2.7245,1.8909,2.3875,2.711,2.2677,6.8638,0.7339,2.4839,5.0033,1.8348,4.1469,2.2457,1.5145,4.7112,9.5307,0.1122,0.0305,0.4299,0.2852,0.9869,0.81,0.9622,6.2555,6.1881,2.8478,0.3417,2.5072,0.6178,3.9491,1.7032,2.0817,3.6886,3.2988,2.7302,7.756,0.1869,2.6157,1.2787,3.6328,5.7289,3.6703,1.0682,0.9166,1.6537,7.0033,0.0756,0.4197,1.2017,2.2758,2.5736,2.7894,3.5705,2.5445,1.3881,0.2487,0.1337,2.3539,0.1022,2.3981,0.9786,1.1591,1.8256,1.1879,6.8579,2.3094,1.0846,1.7529,1.8052,0.4013,0.6514,6.4766,1.1458,3.7163,2.5403,4.2763,3.9864,0.7546,0.7272,0.4107,0.1269,5.7431,0.5543,2.5429,3.7308,1.5068,3.6764,3.1362,0.4584,3.1311,0.9822,0.5178,0.0128,1.46,0.9197,0.1803,0.094,2.4124,0.1074,0.8104,1.2194,4.0584,5.4715,7.17,2.6424,3.3228,0.0885,3.8518,10.0538,0.7105,2.155,1.007,1.7395,0.2056,0.04,1.0033,0.3158,3.4983,0.1398,1.297,3.2452,2.1771,2.7366,0.7933,5.2028,6.4695,1.2866,3.3634,0.0233,0.1305,7.0733,3.374,2.9764,0.4728,3.9171,2.0587,2.8722,0.0535,1.802,3.9738,0.8892,2.7007,1.6631,8.0308,0.0648,4.7362,1.271,1.0645,2.1958,2.2124,6.0515,0.6069,3.2362,3.6479,0.6257,1.4189,2.6838,2.8296,2.1619,6.0186,1.4875,4.7519,5.8308,5.4676,2.613,6.6976,6.021,0.1207,1.4434,5.7941,0.869,4.0314,6.064,2.9004,1.423,3.4482,0.9755,2.4838,0.5773,2.2639,5.0817,0.7743,4.4598,1.9811,5.0472,1.5052,6.2754,0.0624,6.0513,1.3815,1.2244,0.0992,0.4298,2.9348,1.9128,1.4617,10.1146,4.4989,0.1574,1.5133,3.1107,2.7202,1.3327,2.5083,7.0427,1.2747,5.8526,0.3557,0.8003,2.2924,3.7135,3.9458,0.0625,6.1727,2.7215,3.0251,3.1831,0.6379,1.9386,2.5914,0.5556,0.0995,7.0685,3.7355,1.0324,2.1833,0.3675,0.1366,3.4048,0.2804,5.5404,4.352,5.3167,0.0015,4.7323,2.3358,2.4853,0.3789,0.9189,0.5599,4.6264,4.1157,5.5145,2.3838,0.1209,1.0832,4.2612,2.094,5.5143,7.362,1.4691,6.12,1.9199,0.4947,1.0628,2.1822,3.9607,1.6153,2.3324,0.0559,0.0042,0.1178,0.5907,1.6429,6.1348,1.1242,0.1854,1.7611,8.0574,0.2396,0.0211,2.1722,4.2641,1.9727,0.0986,0.0041,0.102,3.5163,3.4187,4.6858,2.8835,3.1975,0.2802,0.0672,0.9676,1.3218,4.1307,1.4059,4.354,0.243,3.315,0.9487,0.2031,0.0095,7.0265,2.8996,0.3771,5.9242,0.3596,7.1543,2.2073,0.9387,0.837,0.8159,1.1932,6.501,1.3163,1.2976,2.288,2.2886,0.0129,0.0204,1.3561,4.5357,6.2561,4.408,4.2792,6.0154,4.7238,6.2075,1.7007,5.8737,0.1176,0.1391,3.5696,3.4816,3.4942,5.273,0.0371,0.0117,5.2843,3.9287,4.6037,1.2537,0.4593,4.5502,0.1789,7.2254,1.4626,1.4658,0.6963,2.7366,1.9136,2.3839,4.2568,6.2947,3.956,2.3609,5.8586,3.3942,4.1182,0.8401,4.8345,0.0065,1.9524,4.1772,0.0018,0.0043,3.7071,3.2369,0.4294,0.3015,4.2718,4.2099,2.2321,3.2743,0.012,0.0192,4.5523,4.7707,6.9273,2.434,2.141,1.3723,0.0949,5.2101,1.9505,3.309,1.1987,3.1303,1.0244,0.797,4.9818,3.0814,2.6153,1.1228,2.6317,3.9769,1.3145,1.6186,2.4687,5.3277,1.2847,0.3491,3.0108,0.5795,2.6788,2.7219,2.3879,0.2936,3.8785,5.929,0.6646,1.5334,4.9784,1.2851,6.9425,1.5787,0.4092,2.3166,2.8768,0.2048,3.8662,4.0621,3.9076,1.5522,2.9655,5.9684,7.8421,0.4381,0.003,2.5801,1.0727,0.9583,2.1689,1.7804,0.6384,1.2023,0.0723,2.0814]}

{"prompt":"Hungary s main opposition party would be unable to compete at an election next April if state auditors impose a heavy fine in a campaign finance case , a vice chairman for the nationalist Jobbik","text":"Hungary s main opposition party would be unable to compete at an election next April if state auditors impose a heavy fine in a campaign finance case, a vice chairman for the nationalist Jobbik party told local media on Thursday.\n\"The current state administration wants to impose a fine which would leave the Jobbik party without the ability to participate in the election,\" L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1nk\u00e1ny, who also chairs the party's public affairs committee, told state news agency Magyar Nemzet.\nMr R\u00e1nk\u00e1ny, who is also on the national governing coalition's economic and social committee, said that the fine would be imposed by the state auditor, Gy\u00f6rgy Babits, as the ruling party's candidate in the election is facing criminal charges.\nThe Jobbik coalition, founded in 1997 by nationalist and anti-immigrant activists, has grown in popularity since, and has polled between 9% and 19% nationally, reaching its highest vote share in last year's elections. However, its popularity has fallen recently as polls show it likely to fall below 9%.\nMr R\u00e1nk\u00e1ny said, \"My belief is that a fine would not be imposed against the Jobbik candidate, the fine would be imposed on the opposition.\"\nMr Babits has alleged that his predecessor, Tibor T\u00f3th, and other state officials misused money to fund a range of campaigns including Jobbik's and the conservative Fidesz party, and to promote the party's leader on television.\nMr Babits announced in September that he would investigate misconduct that he said had been committed by several government ministers, such as the agriculture minister and the justice minister.\nMr R\u00e1nk\u00e1ny said that he was confident that Mr Babits would take the decision to impose the fine against the Jobbik candidate after the election.\nMeanwhile, two ministers have been sacked in a cabinet reshuffle, raising speculation that one of Mr Babits's cases against the government might be related to the new cabinet.\nJobbik national president Gy\u00f6rgy Matolcsy, who was elected the country leader in the party's annual convention last week, said that the loss of both ministers, the health minister Istv\u00e1n Mikolajczyk and the culture minister P\u00e9ter Szent-Iv\u00e1nyi, was a consequence of criticism from the party and the Hungarian public.\nAt the same time, Mr Matolcsy stressed that Jobbik's move to leave the government was only a short-term one.\n\"We had hoped (it) would stay longer, but the government has made big mistakes and it is looking weak,\" he said.\nMr Matolcsy said that he wanted to take a leadership role not only for Jobbik, but also in the governing coalition in which a majority of the seven parties in the assembly are aligned with the government.\nHe did not elaborate on what would happen once the coalition falls apart, but has said that the cabinet will not continue as a cabinet and Mr Babits's appointment of a new auditor would be reviewed.","token_len":633,"entropy":[6.4233,9.5021,8.6841,4.3369,1.0956,7.1135,1.8598,4.3465,0.0558,6.4749,4.2208,4.2828,0.9555,4.4232,5.3032,3.3097,9.4142,9.4184,0.0312,7.3889,1.5798,5.1825,2.0831,5.4278,2.5969,4.5913,3.7427,1.3302,2.2028,2.4758,9.1459,3.7556,3.7691,0.4912,6.3471,3.403,0.0148,0.0012,0.2043,1.2057,5.3254,0.8867,1.5566,2.0114,0.1084,0.1957,10.9598,1.69,4.8582,3.6341,4.1215,4.6812,0.3605,2.3149,0.7276,0.8259,4.7449,2.1721,5.3401,1.2595,4.231,0.0087,0.0039,0.3738,2.6647,1.9268,1.8667,0.0187,3.26,0.2148,1.1591,1.6607,0.9273,6.688,3.4152,0.0006,0.0048,4.9228,4.613,6.3951,2.958,3.6912,1.2012,3.2222,5.0866,2.6523,0.1697,1.2502,0.1577,5.9669,0.6846,0.3011,0.0971,0.4018,2.7203,2.7993,0.0927,10.5895,0.5125,0.0181,9.1138,3.301,1.8923,0.9582,0.1873,8.1202,0.9042,0.0185,0.0035,0.0048,0.0004,2.4775,0.5197,1.4422,1.716,4.864,0.6211,4.2111,3.8494,2.7796,0.9209,4.6304,1.9334,1.3683,2.3159,0.044,0.5944,2.275,1.3296,3.9246,0.8399,1.2817,2.2813,2.7091,0.8829,2.7076,1.9073,2.0268,7.9428,0.7237,0.0209,6.74,7.7887,1.4785,3.8532,3.0297,4.1223,0.7292,2.9121,3.8232,1.4786,0.5276,2.379,5.4679,4.8494,6.8011,0.1701,0.789,0.2451,1.3699,3.0496,0.0027,0.0012,6.3219,2.2509,4.1109,0.5017,4.1468,2.2054,3.8257,4.0155,2.6251,0.0027,2.1419,5.3729,0.4816,1.0768,5.4269,2.761,0.8398,1.6492,7.3852,2.5429,1.7167,6.647,4.6241,4.3915,2.0944,0.0729,3.9223,0.2331,4.4547,1.5631,6.4251,3.5947,1.1582,6.0755,0.2331,0.8626,6.0911,0.3513,0.0033,1.9955,0.2837,5.2174,0.057,3.1911,2.9716,0.4903,2.5164,5.8443,2.2686,4.3016,0.8309,1.8231,5.7857,0.0542,1.9122,3.6845,3.6882,1.669,0.2689,2.7697,0.2309,0.0214,0.0036,0.0031,0.0005,0.577,5.6166,1.4526,6.2186,5.6718,0.149,0.194,3.8664,1.3984,2.3012,2.4014,0.9509,0.7642,4.4156,0.8936,1.3037,0.0012,0.0011,3.512,1.6242,4.442,6.2274,0.6233,0.4717,0.5646,1.4643,0.6461,4.1209,2.8115,0.2805,2.2286,1.8258,0.0048,2.843,6.2411,0.1922,2.8771,5.1623,0.6522,8.2199,0.4559,4.4551,4.6689,1.9598,1.343,3.9428,2.6363,5.0782,0.9137,6.6765,0.9317,3.4696,2.5583,3.362,2.4263,7.6365,0.0006,4.2485,3.6212,5.5377,0.0563,0.0025,0.9916,4.2289,1.1786,5.5955,4.7672,0.4979,0.0006,0.3095,2.7985,3.0635,3.7262,4.1272,1.733,1.7182,0.5245,5.7303,5.2662,3.2025,0.5526,0.4729,2.2997,1.999,0.0034,7.0186,1.8831,2.5373,0.3874,0.5438,0.5569,6.1457,8.3548,4.37,2.5453,0.6246,1.7072,1.8888,1.3337,0.4264,5.2072,3.2133,1.9653,1.3612,5.2551,0.0009,1.8245,5.7791,0.0639,1.6183,1.2344,3.9872,0.0241,0.8161,0.649,2.2747,0.6794,0.0233,0.0043,0.0035,0.0005,0.5742,1.1471,2.3482,2.0525,3.0155,0.4144,2.7025,1.9911,0.0034,0.3988,4.583,1.4206,5.2801,1.078,1.4358,0.6014,0.1189,3.7757,1.0419,2.3762,0.001,0.0008,0.6349,4.0678,1.5053,2.3017,0.7994,0.5371,5.8034,0.0808,5.0802,5.8792,2.3358,1.322,3.4796,2.5273,1.994,6.1899,0.363,0.0007,1.7349,5.8168,3.4979,0.3315,4.144,0.9743,4.9946,1.6843,0.0026,0.7026,10.7749,3.9747,0.9686,2.7838,2.5164,0.9247,3.5556,0.0214,1.5432,5.5098,3.4225,1.5216,0.5663,6.3151,3.0977,0.1533,7.3256,1.5576,5.3902,0.158,0.0031,6.5061,6.262,6.0932,8.4149,2.5638,0.7925,1.553,3.1928,4.0272,3.0111,8.7501,0.5893,3.2258,5.2742,0.0401,5.5385,4.7419,2.7448,1.9503,0.1042,3.2457,1.6612,1.6392,7.0698,0.0519,5.2574,2.8831,2.8831,3.8829,7.0692,0.1155,7.3246,2.4765,0.775,0.0261,5.8689,3.124,2.3035,3.9963,0.9363,0.2916,0.3993,6.8403,0.0909,4.7697,1.9754,0.1736,3.1011,5.081,5.0476,8.9045,1.4888,2.8524,1.9347,0.3996,1.635,1.2,4.3302,0.012,7.2207,2.1099,1.2182,1.9327,3.242,1.684,6.6385,1.9529,0.699,0.403,5.9585,0.6597,1.2987,0.2056,0.0472,1.4081,0.5997,0.0058,0.0014,0.0084,5.2714,0.2034,3.3051,0.0044,0.0012,1.7135,5.9041,0.5222,5.5478,0.4638,4.0658,1.1988,4.1411,1.2146,4.8597,0.1964,0.0867,4.1491,1.1087,1.0892,0.6007,1.459,4.4943,2.9779,5.697,3.4369,1.1239,0.1833,5.8193,6.5728,1.3813,0.32,2.5342,2.3142,1.7826,3.6803,5.3171,2.3192,1.7921,2.5985,1.2121,5.699,4.6139,1.0267,0.2978,0.4304,0.3127,0.7889,2.3078,0.2118,0.0042,0.0025,0.0008,1.1036,0.3901,2.2775,4.5682,0.5076,3.5894,2.1309,5.0214,0.3437,6.7364,0.8461,1.5818,2.1768,0.002,0.0008,1.085,0.0503,1.2566,4.5731,0.5248,5.2672,0.1045,4.2456,2.6,5.0234,1.9132,0.2237,1.2469,6.9891,3.9272,4.3038,0.6079,5.6155,1.1493,4.5673,2.9176,0.9642,2.0585,0.2546,0.5163,2.1026,4.46,0.0442,2.6948,0.5249,1.6247,2.9838,0.323,5.3319,0.549,5.7688,4.7009,2.1776,1.3055,0.556,6.3578,1.1702,0.2449,1.4286,5.9371,2.0286,2.8182,5.3753,2.7736,1.3759,5.5161,3.3621,5.7131,4.9417,0.0065,1.6313,4.2215,2.8535,2.6035,1.2591,7.5101,1.3736,1.444,6.0585,1.0357]}
{"prompt":"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan expressed confidence on Thursday that Congress will pass an overhaul of the U.S. tax code by the end of this year , a major","text":"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan expressed confidence on Thursday that Congress will pass an overhaul of the U.S. tax code by the end of this year, a major priority for President Donald Trump.\nMnuchin announced the deal in a White House meeting with representatives from nine Republican business groups. In remarks afterward, he described the accord as a \u201ctwenty-first century tax code that is fairer, lower-cost, and simpler,\u201d offering the potential for $34 trillion in tax cuts.\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not an American tax code,\u201d he said, pointing out its many features were taken from other nations.\nMnuchin\u2019s announcement followed an announcement before the start of an Obama administration tax law enforcement working group from the Treasury Department and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that it will look into whether some companies and individuals who paid little or no U.S. federal income taxes could be hiding foreign assets in offshore accounts.\nTrump, who campaigned on plans to eliminate the corporate tax, has called tax reform the No. 1 priority of his presidency and pledged to sign a bill he could win that would reduce the corporate tax rate from 35.7 percent to 10 percent.\nIn the two years after Trump was elected president he has promised to take the U.S. out of the 2015 World Trade Organization, raise the corporate tax rate, and implement payroll taxes on all foreign citizens working in the United States.\nAt Trump\u2019s call, Congress has not acted on his policies and has done almost nothing on tax reform since it met as the legislative branch to begin work on the code in July.\nHouse Republicans are expected to reject any tax overhaul bill that Democrats and independent lawmakers could sign off on, setting up a vote that requires the president\u2019s signature.\nThe Republican tax proposal, a top priority of Trump, would replace a 2017 tax law he signed with a new code aimed at reducing taxes on businesses and families while adding to the deficit. Trump has criticized Democrats for trying to take advantage of the government shutdown and saying that taxes on the wealthy will be eliminated by the end of his administration.\n\u201cThis is a new tax code that will put money directly back in the pockets of working people and families by reducing taxes on businesses and families while also creating millions of good-paying tax-filing jobs across America,\u201d he said in a video posted on his website.\nRepublicans have been trying to put a stop to tax overhaul initiatives like those put forth by Democrats and independent members of Congress for years, and in recent weeks, the White House and Republicans in Congress pushed to avoid confrontation over a potential compromise before December tax filing time, when millions of taxpayers are expected to file their tax returns.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate a Democratic candidate for Treasury secretary after withdrawing his nominee, former Kansas governor Larry Kudlow. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is another Democratic candidate with considerable tax expertise and familiarity with the Senate, but Biden has said he doesn\u2019t support a Democrat in that role.","token_len":634,"entropy":[9.6979,2.1784,1.5827,0.0049,0.0,2.9505,3.9516,5.2237,0.0195,1.0863,0.3548,0.0275,6.6528,3.0716,3.0441,1.7667,0.4022,3.7252,0.866,1.1581,3.4202,3.4744,0.1748,0.4168,3.4062,0.0003,0.002,0.0163,0.8869,0.0752,2.3702,0.9877,0.0569,0.0006,2.1869,0.276,1.5093,2.7995,4.4846,4.5244,0.5102,2.1556,0.7148,0.0057,0.2899,0.1838,17.7724,0.0029,0.0001,4.831,1.4308,3.9927,2.0731,0.4694,3.7014,0.0005,2.5713,0.5191,5.8606,0.7417,5.4765,2.5453,6.2342,1.0289,1.7988,4.5846,5.3321,7.3004,0.0479,1.6507,4.6402,0.5083,6.5923,0.1877,0.9349,18.6574,7.2168,10.4913,2.0693,0.1706,1.6682,1.8619,3.6892,2.1331,1.9785,2.6378,4.4485,0.0036,1.8085,3.5372,3.3084,2.6853,1.1529,0.7847,2.7237,3.1292,13.9095,7.3121,7.006,3.0408,4.6647,0.5957,6.4403,6.9444,0.4536,0.3012,0.8234,0.923,2.675,0.2917,11.6477,1.214,6.2785,2.6606,0.8215,0.241,1.594,0.7997,0.5485,1.9938,4.9947,1.0013,0.3011,1.9056,1.0467,1.7029,5.2742,0.31,1.4645,5.2475,1.2985,6.8274,4.6055,4.8066,6.4974,5.6097,0.2935,2.3982,1.8524,0.8448,1.2205,4.8062,0.0023,0.0004,8.2285,6.6171,3.5579,2.9653,4.3085,2.8795,2.0721,6.8674,0.6346,4.4966,0.0034,3.3826,5.5476,0.975,4.7412,6.8566,6.1606,6.5821,0.0416,6.4317,1.2721,1.3578,0.0719,2.1136,3.0035,0.9904,0.0003,0.0884,0.0202,0.0016,1.6852,2.4371,2.8277,5.7606,1.1289,2.2383,4.545,4.783,3.4679,0.7404,3.3405,3.7004,4.063,0.191,0.0539,5.1216,0.0011,0.0008,0.0019,3.898,0.2648,0.529,3.5108,1.2569,9.2068,4.7354,4.7365,1.9697,3.8172,1.5784,0.6551,0.4947,3.8542,2.9665,0.8763,3.7166,0.2556,6.7727,0.1154,3.2791,0.7984,2.3164,0.4655,2.0694,1.3469,3.4974,6.1657,0.8938,2.7592,5.95,0.009,0.1509,0.3333,1.0187,0.1503,2.1043,1.576,3.2506,0.346,5.1891,1.8225,2.0724,3.9301,6.2501,7.8321,6.6071,0.2072,3.6777,0.9216,0.975,0.4478,0.0468,1.1049,0.1829,4.2853,3.2104,0.1044,0.0988,3.9382,0.1961,0.6905,0.5584,3.5944,2.1695,4.9143,2.4043,3.3431,2.2672,3.6725,0.505,2.1179,4.3216,0.9276,2.7399,0.2623,4.1153,2.5912,2.2552,0.0006,0.0024,0.0176,1.0492,0.0017,0.1738,7.2598,4.3494,0.3023,0.0074,2.3601,5.7241,1.6279,0.5906,0.5561,0.1019,3.0865,0.5256,5.4164,9.2133,1.1715,1.3463,2.7783,5.9483,6.4755,4.8002,0.4657,0.094,1.0398,0.0033,0.2389,0.595,5.1716,5.4174,9.2913,1.6186,0.1176,8.5728,1.4939,6.3379,2.2986,3.46,4.1078,0.913,2.4622,5.5208,2.6719,2.0824,4.5366,8.0547,0.0484,2.096,2.6527,0.2187,2.6404,4.878,5.0966,6.8121,3.3974,5.578,1.9974,4.8567,3.3361,2.7551,0.336,1.513,7.6462,1.2805,3.0086,0.425,0.5077,4.6271,1.5094,2.5819,1.9479,0.0126,5.6974,2.0695,2.7917,1.6934,3.4436,1.9209,6.8145,2.6544,5.2545,2.5324,4.0919,3.3073,4.4062,0.006,1.8591,6.7161,0.7471,0.366,4.7983,3.757,7.4404,2.0419,2.6555,5.045,0.4852,0.0024,0.2324,1.048,0.4658,2.2386,3.9832,3.1468,5.0177,2.1599,4.692,5.6025,0.3381,1.3125,1.0435,0.6104,1.733,5.118,2.3056,7.9162,1.4612,2.4024,4.5831,1.2513,2.7065,0.9708,3.1438,4.7499,5.5935,0.0389,2.3173,2.6463,0.9244,3.162,0.993,4.7696,4.7534,5.2402,3.425,0.7834,2.1502,0.6062,3.8997,1.4973,4.4051,3.417,0.3621,3.9121,0.0247,4.5559,2.7483,0.0024,0.908,5.897,0.7802,1.8145,6.2632,2.1217,5.7227,1.2523,1.3422,0.4535,1.8885,1.3691,3.416,3.1494,1.5998,0.2024,0.0026,1.591,2.4276,0.1667,0.3605,2.95,0.2047,4.2751,0.9394,1.288,4.0922,1.4038,0.0852,1.2808,2.2004,5.0745,4.6106,5.8292,3.321,1.8405,0.5367,0.4288,0.0144,2.996,1.4985,1.4846,2.1904,5.0545,2.6496,1.2948,0.3785,3.6037,0.6494,1.1567,3.1281,2.3423,2.9545,3.3686,0.2163,4.3465,0.8686,0.0007,5.5906,2.167,5.9926,3.4291,0.5713,3.8871,1.5484,2.7527,1.2411,0.8999,3.1706,0.1673,2.4838,0.9119,4.4502,1.6531,1.1428,1.6363,1.3921,0.6363,0.3708,4.508,1.379,2.3295,2.4096,0.1209,4.7478,1.7993,1.5719,0.0046,3.527,3.9383,7.6884,3.9758,4.4458,5.2518,2.0813,0.0911,2.3836,1.2493,2.0892,3.6313,0.1148,0.2742,3.5013,0.6412,1.1644,2.3347,4.1833,1.9477,0.6601,2.7889,2.0645,1.8248,0.0006,2.139,4.463,2.6077,0.2973,6.8717,2.2038,5.4257,7.8534,2.3266,3.2307,3.4125,5.7291,6.135,7.822,9.6726,7.1341,8.2487,2.5934,3.6999,5.5143,0.1489,3.0328,2.9216,1.0006,0.0069,1.0377,0.861,1.6235,0.047,0.3486,0.3131,5.326,4.0872,0.0051,11.1108,1.5957,4.0764,0.8467,0.0367,5.6057,1.7495,4.0668,4.3036,1.0464,3.4977,0.2638,4.204,8.6309,1.2424,5.2652,3.1069,2.5147,8.0451,2.2454,6.2177,7.739,0.494,0.0001,1.0176,5.5612,2.7122,0.2367,1.2783,0.5911,0.8256,0.0138,1.6464,5.7311,3.0314,1.9221,4.236,6.4358,5.1488,3.5306,2.2811,6.4336,0.3258,0.7892,5.034,2.4044,2.2997,5.8929,1.4083,2.45,0.516,3.5207,3.0706,2.3935,0.0052,2.9841,1.7093,5.5126,2.0348,4.1887,1.4618,0.2832]}

{"prompt":"Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Monday it was vital that European Union negotiators agree to move the talks on to discuss trade , saying it was of huge value to all members","text":"Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Monday it was vital that European Union negotiators agree to move the talks on to discuss trade, saying it was of huge value to all members of the bloc.\nBritain s exit from the EU is expected to be finalised in March. The UK and its 27 EU partners are in a final stretch after nearly four years of turmoil in the negotiations.\nThe new rules that set the framework of trade with the UK will last five years, meaning the parties have until January 2020 to renegotiate any of its terms.\n\"It s hugely important that we see an open, honest and constructive dialogue that can take us forward, \" Davis told the Conservative group s Commons European Union committee meeting.\n\"I rema n convinced that we cannot simply repeat the same mistakes that have been made in the past... that s why I think it is vital that we all support it. \"\nWith only a few months left to move the talks forward, it is a key test of whether Britain s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, can persuade his fellow Tories and EU governments to push ahead with a hard-fought deal.\nJohnson, who says he want to leave the EU in just a few weeks time, is pressing for a deal to be signed before a December summit to discuss the next stage in negotiations, rather than the one that came to an abrupt halt in October.\nThe European Parliament s deadline comes after weeks of debate, and even anger, in the 27 countries, who have also been pushed to the limits by a series of Brexit referendums in the three countries that voted to leave the EU last June: Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands.\nThe British EU referendum campaign and Johnson's leadership of Britain's Conservative Party had the effect of causing unease in the bloc of which it forms one part.\n\"The next few weeks are pivotal, \" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who oversaw the EU's divorce deal talks with the UK when he was a commissioner, told the UK's Channel 4 News on Sunday.\n\"Ultimately, we all want to see a very good result. We are ready to start, \" he said.\n\"However we have to move really quickly. We need to act and we need to act as a single EU, \" said the president of Commission headquarters in Brussels, in the Netherlands.\nThe deal Johnson is pushing for is known as the \"backstop, \" and it would be maintained in case there is no trade deal with the EU in place by then.\nThe backstop would be a new customs border in Northern Ireland which would see the British border still open to EU goods until a \"workable alternative\" is found.\nBut the backstop has caused deep divisions within the bloc, and Britain has also threatened that it might refuse to accept it should the European

{"prompt":"The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking , the panel said in a statement","text":"The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, the panel said in a statement Monday.The legislation, known as the U.S. Cybercrime Victim Protection Act, would create a task force within the U.S. Department of Justice that would help prosecute offenders of a wide range of sex trafficking cases.The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a similar piece of legislation last week after a congressional working group determined that prosecuting sex crimes on the internet is too slow and too few sex crimes are being prosecuted compared to other types of offenses.The commissioners added that the new action would enhance the ability of law enforcement to quickly identify and locate digital devices allegedly used to facilitate the sex trade.It would also require that companies offering online services to report suspicious transactions to law enforcement.\"This bipartisan push to crack down on sex trafficking online is a significant step toward ensuring greater justice for all victims of the worst human rights violation in the world,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee\u2019s chairman, told reporters after the meeting.The proposal requires companies to be held responsible for content posted on their platforms unless they can prove that material had been removed by users without their knowledge, or the material was posted on the company\u2019s behalf.The House version also requires the government to block foreign websites that promote online sex trafficking and prosecute a wider range of crime, including fraud and online child sexual abuse.The committee said that the language in the working group\u2019s latest proposal on criminal prosecutions mirrors provisions of a 2007 law that requires companies to collect \u201creasonable use\u201d fees from website users to \u201chelp fund investigations related to the use of their service,\u201d but the measure does not address the online sex trade.The bill\u2019s opponents, however, say the bipartisan framework for an increase in sex trafficking prosecutions is inadequate, and that the law focuses more on protecting individual web users than on increasing criminal arrests for sex trafficking.\"Any bill that puts people first and not business interests is a good bill,\" said Rep. Barbara Comstock, D-Calif.\"They\u2019re saying, 'Okay, just go ahead and get on with it. The Senate\u2019s going to pass these things, and the Congress will pass these things.' When do you people see what we\u2019ve accomplished?\"Rep. Jim Costa, R-Calif., chair of the Homeland Security Caucus, said that his Republican colleagues believe the White House isn\u2019t doing much to crack down on sex trafficking, and that the goal of the legislation should be to make it easier for victims of online sex trafficking to file complaints.\"They say they\u2019re going to push for an increase in punishment,\" Costa said. But to what end? What does Congress need to do to actually do the damage they are trying to do?\"Rep. Matt Riddle, D-Ariz., added, \"There\u2019s enough money to start this program, but I guarantee you, it\u2019s not going on the first priority list after the next stimulus package.\"","token_len":634,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,7.0889,0.2034,2.6734,2.304,2.6796,0.3464,0.2078,1.1111,3.6183,3.3923,1.6308,0.1708,3.3383,1.0017,0.4746,1.8589,9.0398,0.0046,7.8498,1.1175,6.8147,0.7632,5.3929,3.3656,4.2615,0.5847,1.6188,2.7115,5.2004,0.9395,1.4119,0.1106,0.9218,3.5745,0.1216,6.2566,3.4356,1.3396,2.4544,0.0256,0.4276,5.9327,0.0218,0.0186,0.0191,3.2669,1.5977,5.414,0.6843,0.3637,0.261,0.4347,3.6732,0.5295,4.3948,0.0121,5.4709,0.1122,2.0988,0.0003,0.0026,0.0011,0.8062,0.0005,0.5823,2.3135,0.2026,4.1508,4.0635,4.0637,3.1978,5.5632,2.7339,0.272,0.0031,3.8434,0.2969,3.7451,0.7443,1.7854,2.7581,0.0004,0.0029,0.0018,2.8944,0.3393,0.0064,4.6314,1.7502,0.748,5.187,0.0346,0.0366,1.214,1.9064,3.6763,1.9335,3.9256,8.8745,0.0076,5.0322,0.4726,7.8548,1.8671,4.7706,2.5349,1.4813,2.1945,1.641,2.8411,4.6303,1.3843,2.7011,6.2433,10.1403,2.0571,2.4446,2.5934,0.9059,7.6293,0.2913,0.8861,3.9509,0.0056,2.7452,0.6182,1.3452,9.6958,5.2509,0.3383,1.2764,3.9899,6.6764,1.2134,6.0481,1.1162,2.3649,0.2509,1.6148,0.0102,0.7423,3.8587,1.8774,0.7736,5.783,7.928,6.4926,6.8718,1.1085,0.8087,1.1776,2.4244,2.5696,0.5612,1.0382,3.7832,1.4756,0.3121,3.691,2.2005,3.0122,5.2605,1.6518,1.0113,2.0233,6.7802,3.9435,3.4614,0.8839,1.9185,0.0037,3.2279,1.7783,4.837,6.4495,1.1914,3.3648,0.0028,0.0233,2.4321,0.1715,4.9305,1.1951,1.277,3.7846,0.1955,1.932,3.03,5.4003,4.7409,0.3129,3.1949,0.5106,0.5686,3.31,5.8853,3.0624,3.8722,3.416,1.3898,1.2945,0.2711,0.3643,4.0517,0.0014,2.4172,0.0619,0.0,0.8215,3.0282,3.5593,20.2801,9.0134,5.1783,3.5592,0.3412,2.6256,1.043,3.1945,0.3616,2.1075,0.5039,1.8844,3.209,6.6549,2.2728,0.7915,5.5977,3.3566,1.9788,0.2846,6.9928,2.7554,0.9559,0.961,3.1895,6.669,1.4282,3.536,0.5154,0.9367,6.8726,4.7337,0.807,3.215,2.6577,3.8419,3.0557,1.6922,1.2831,2.3116,2.7711,2.7682,3.8356,0.8576,3.6261,2.3059,2.2163,3.6483,12.8222,0.592,0.2536,2.2765,0.8858,1.7351,4.3704,3.4028,2.9132,1.5007,2.8581,2.7242,0.099,6.85,7.1585,0.8192,0.8339,2.8693,2.7508,0.4255,0.1594,2.1447,6.002,6.3608,5.9984,0.2276,0.0008,5.6991,1.6082,0.4871,4.8986,1.2926,4.8749,2.7921,3.7992,2.2182,0.627,1.2922,3.4637,2.9181,1.8435,1.4185,6.8101,1.5383,0.1047,8.5176,0.2813,5.8168,0.2985,0.1535,6.4066,1.7434,6.0804,3.528,7.2103,6.8338,4.0379,2.4848,3.0849,5.0235,1.5751,0.7448,3.9032,2.2883,0.3975,5.8737,14.2243,5.8912,8.7867,8.0583,4.768,5.3419,7.5511,1.1149,6.3671,1.4763,1.6655,14.5901,0.1854,4.7361,5.6404,2.6909,6.1099,0.0022,2.1709,3.3564,0.0808,3.0081,4.0895,2.6824,7.4964,6.6354,2.6266,2.2473,3.4334,2.274,0.0317,3.3478,1.4968,4.6294,1.4314,0.9677,0.8393,1.2024,3.247,5.6089,0.3718,0.0112,7.5556,3.1449,1.0,0.0017,1.837,1.4621,6.0695,5.6881,4.1472,5.8591,5.4227,0.0641,5.6789,0.1935,1.3596,1.4522,3.8734,2.2795,0.8633,1.4237,1.3912,4.2261,7.2454,2.9498,0.1237,3.8175,4.7358,7.37,0.2289,1.3798,1.2461,5.629,3.2608,7.4941,2.469,1.8791,0.7276,1.7739,5.8126,3.3811,0.4607,4.8917,5.1049,4.2449,2.118,3.5862,6.6969,3.9345,4.5612,2.0217,4.5548,4.3121,0.7984,0.5558,1.9914,0.0006,5.0544,1.4333,0.0034,0.1473,1.1331,0.0027,3.65,4.6481,5.1908,11.5026,2.0889,1.0693,4.7502,2.8266,0.3738,5.9577,0.1199,5.5636,3.4841,0.6526,0.2139,3.6679,4.2098,1.1295,0.6925,1.9846,4.2723,6.7939,5.3218,0.4287,0.1919,2.3739,0.0209,3.2527,4.5838,3.0451,2.0292,1.1613,2.1321,4.1023,1.5797,1.8736,2.0046,0.3789,1.8977,5.8049,5.6179,1.522,9.738,4.39,3.877,2.9304,2.8737,0.6449,1.3117,5.3359,1.2715,2.9383,0.0356,3.9255,4.4763,0.0575,2.4202,0.0021,0.4559,0.0632,5.0005,0.2603,0.0214,4.9822,0.0043,7.3597,0.2097,0.721,3.6518,3.5735,5.246,0.2898,4.3575,0.9075,6.1749,0.0006,6.046,2.7739,0.7037,0.0057,2.7036,4.5652,0.332,4.526,0.0029,0.0394,2.4308,0.1038,2.0224,1.2071,0.7711,1.1379,5.3161,1.5528,0.6664,2.5319,2.8839,0.1201,0.4834,2.4965,0.6865,0.3529,0.2468,2.9941,0.9137,1.5196,0.4271,0.111,0.1193,2.8033,0.989,2.6663,4.0879,5.0004,2.6345,3.2138,0.0647,0.9721,2.0898,0.082,5.1101,1.2841,3.7529,0.8652,0.1557,7.1132,2.5012,0.326,0.3251,0.3355,6.0662,6.1861,5.3999,2.1095,1.0153,4.6766,2.4548,5.1215,3.0936,0.2246,0.309,0.3325,5.5518,3.6926,3.3564,6.48,4.1212,1.7183,2.5525,0.0228,0.2451,1.3411,4.1975,0.0399,5.7993,7.7269,2.7024,0.1026,0.8378,0.0056,4.251,0.0002,0.0349,4.3972,1.4371,0.1115,3.4157,2.693,0.1649,0.0863,5.7041,2.0205,1.563,4.8471,3.9586,4.4651,1.6306,1.9305,2.4895,7.3792,0.425,1.8958,2.0192,2.3906,0.0412,0.1114,1.3026,0.395,7.701,2.3805,6.3826,6.1027,0.8211,6.1655,1.7191,2.6858,8.4712,0.7042,1.8981]}
{"prompt":"A fireworks explosion injured 39 people , including six children between the ages of 11 and 15 , during a popular Cuban carnival on Christmas Eve , state-run media reported on Monday . The centuries-old","text":"A fireworks explosion injured 39 people, including six children between the ages of 11 and 15, during a popular Cuban carnival on Christmas Eve, state-run media reported on Monday. The centuries-old, nonpolitical fireworks display was held at the Vedado stadium in Havana. The explosion occurred shortly after the main fireworks show was about to begin, leading to confusion about the cause in the crowd, the state-run news agency reported. Cuban authorities released a photo from a witness account showing a man who they said suffered a broken leg, but no other details were immediately available, Cuban state-run television reported. According to state-run reports, the explosion shook most of the crowd, though none of the victims suffered any chest injuries. The cause of the accident is not yet known, but investigators will determine if the fireworks were set off accidentally or intentionally, the state-run news agency showed footage of an injured man and a child being carried away. The fireworks were expected to last an hour. The explosion sent the crowd running from the stadium, but there was no immediate report of injuries, the news agency said. The last fireworks display in the city was held on May 31. Fireworks have been a part of the Cuban Christmas tradition since at least the 1940s, and are expected to be held in the Cuban capital from midnight Tuesday to just before the dawn of Wednesday, state-run television reported. The accident comes just days after Cuban authorities suspended a two-hour fireworks display at a stadium to accommodate a soccer match in the capital. The move was the latest effort among Cuban officials to curb the country's growing popularity for organized games. The Cuban soccer team is scheduled to play a friendly soccer match with a team from Spain after playing last week against Bolivia in Cuba. The club president, Alfredo Borrell, said the event would not be held in the stadium. \" We're not letting the games of a minor league go ahead, \" he told Spanish newspaper Marca, according to the news agency. A day after the bombings, two people were killed during a soccer game in Havana, according to Cuban officials. A woman was shot and killed outside a bar in the town of Plaza de Mayo in central Havana, state-run news agency Prensa Latina reported, though she was not immediately identified. Another woman was shot dead as she sat inside her home in a residential zone in the popular tourist resort town of Varadero, reports said. All the victims were Cubans, according to the news agency, but nothing confirmed the identities of the two shot to death Sunday. The latest attack comes after a series of bombings in Cuba have killed at least 25 people since September. The bombings are believed to have been sparked by a string of political and economic sanctions imposed on the island by the US in the wake of the terrorist attacks on Cubans in 1992 and to have a motive to destabilize the government, US officials told Reuters on Monday. The United States has announced new anti-terrorist sanctions and sanctions against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. According to the news agency, the attacks sparked a debate over whether to maintain political and economic sanctions against the US and Venezuela.","token_len":634,"entropy":[12.5569,5.0015,6.1013,6.163,0.2626,2.1139,0.7379,3.1657,0.9863,7.1544,2.4367,0.286,0.0012,3.1491,0.1044,2.0403,0.785,3.1775,0.4697,6.2165,9.5636,6.6125,0.0031,2.4747,5.3308,0.73,1.1884,4.7352,1.6434,0.0466,2.7722,0.4087,1.9796,2.3286,0.1419,2.4329,14.5733,0.0342,0.0193,4.5487,6.7753,5.63,3.3245,1.7339,1.3528,2.3472,1.4394,0.8116,11.6292,3.3392,5.9103,1.062,0.4589,1.7247,1.9555,3.3954,1.7175,3.1263,0.3651,3.4173,4.8246,1.8333,1.1536,2.556,4.3198,0.0947,0.5998,1.1525,6.1356,0.3665,3.815,3.1275,1.1207,1.1883,6.871,0.7532,2.4452,1.5682,2.0739,0.9348,0.3093,0.0162,2.1259,0.0587,1.0727,0.1407,5.7209,1.435,5.2477,0.974,3.5512,3.6811,1.7561,3.6629,2.478,3.0581,1.4921,1.8886,2.7833,6.4802,0.2722,4.5093,1.1366,2.6961,1.8862,2.0446,3.038,4.1551,3.095,1.6478,0.8443,0.8652,0.0645,2.6814,4.8184,1.2046,1.4363,0.0155,3.3451,0.5082,0.124,5.1952,0.0005,2.7994,1.0395,0.0271,5.3244,0.0768,0.7577,3.0316,5.1852,6.428,0.0741,0.0438,3.167,1.1236,3.6888,6.0171,0.5682,0.2721,2.676,3.5037,1.419,10.6487,0.3986,0.5574,1.4357,4.6576,0.1135,0.0366,2.6065,1.3139,1.5237,1.1892,0.2058,0.9686,1.8314,5.6821,5.7364,3.007,1.6235,1.0962,2.2692,1.3132,3.4218,0.5713,4.6533,0.5479,2.9652,1.0219,1.2619,0.7798,0.2055,0.0109,0.797,0.037,8.1553,4.6276,0.6254,4.3093,4.2162,1.1971,3.0676,0.9319,2.3503,4.03,1.8848,1.2012,1.5977,1.3769,2.8296,1.6518,4.6937,0.0128,1.9915,3.5857,0.3038,2.2927,1.5344,3.919,5.4789,2.1903,2.3531,3.7358,3.9111,0.3322,0.4858,0.9403,3.7778,3.3425,0.971,0.0982,0.6305,3.1393,0.0809,0.6206,1.6672,1.2939,3.1502,0.0323,0.8212,0.1455,1.3966,6.6789,1.5542,1.5529,1.3127,2.1764,2.174,1.0307,0.7594,1.6726,3.2754,3.8541,1.79,6.2097,0.0405,3.22,0.4872,2.4688,2.9102,0.0011,1.5937,1.7714,5.0282,1.9116,0.841,2.4624,0.0015,1.2567,4.2827,0.0156,0.7675,2.4765,3.7489,6.0484,0.0078,1.8168,4.1947,1.6487,1.4999,4.334,0.5284,3.4082,6.2706,5.1993,0.6578,8.2862,1.321,2.8859,7.1276,0.2787,6.8277,1.5038,3.2299,0.3998,0.0201,2.3826,0.3953,0.2195,1.3957,8.614,3.359,1.8748,1.8163,0.0934,3.4893,1.0819,4.3175,2.4572,5.4491,0.0154,3.684,1.2499,0.9041,2.4766,1.2332,4.0838,4.3004,5.08,2.6337,6.351,1.1168,2.9415,1.3862,1.5409,0.6702,1.2137,3.6287,1.8108,4.0769,1.2222,4.647,7.1194,2.252,1.2486,0.1623,3.1373,1.1893,2.8687,0.0015,2.4634,2.2881,2.36,7.7932,8.6308,1.2019,1.7457,2.8686,3.4272,0.3075,3.1759,2.2821,0.0613,0.6099,2.33,2.4956,5.4875,0.3583,2.6586,2.7911,3.0105,0.2781,4.6598,5.402,4.5542,5.6499,1.3407,2.8753,5.1718,1.2138,3.9199,1.4007,1.4137,5.6735,6.8998,0.828,6.2191,0.0397,6.6883,3.8817,4.6944,1.3849,1.798,3.948,1.5111,1.7755,0.7306,2.5972,1.3922,1.4275,1.0219,1.1591,1.6915,10.8681,3.6982,1.4157,5.5654,2.1963,3.8728,3.8247,4.2681,5.9541,0.7455,6.4637,3.8617,2.2667,4.9581,0.5677,1.6312,5.2711,2.8946,2.9952,0.1744,1.9405,2.4607,0.0006,1.0826,4.0352,0.1371,0.2144,3.8085,4.3344,1.0933,0.4224,7.4827,0.4452,5.198,3.2745,0.2458,0.6314,4.0795,0.4726,2.8502,2.2898,0.6003,1.3719,1.4418,2.3605,0.0006,3.9333,2.9375,0.2571,2.5509,4.4793,1.1547,2.8661,1.2853,0.8939,3.9253,0.5541,4.0698,0.6865,1.4849,3.979,0.0519,7.557,1.184,3.6518,2.0223,2.9319,0.7093,1.5736,3.5496,0.5604,0.0226,1.6585,0.1384,3.9519,4.8015,0.0179,7.9127,0.1644,0.1149,2.9109,5.7746,3.948,0.7776,0.3027,1.6673,0.5876,0.1605,4.7398,1.7499,0.3187,2.0313,3.2622,4.4414,0.2417,3.9943,4.2401,1.4922,1.5676,0.7833,2.6771,3.2819,6.2858,1.2956,1.0197,6.845,2.1072,2.2931,2.1729,0.1315,8.4904,2.2835,0.3226,0.9395,5.0022,2.9485,0.1369,5.9742,2.1294,1.3869,0.4505,5.7504,0.0035,1.0556,1.8405,0.0008,1.1578,2.0376,0.0479,1.6295,2.1786,7.56,5.134,1.8211,3.0006,0.0697,0.5305,3.6471,9.3045,4.3474,0.6989,9.0771,0.5204,1.4012,5.0331,3.0873,1.2264,2.5716,1.3392,2.8163,0.0012,1.8631,0.6696,2.4953,5.074,1.0523,1.0561,0.0,4.2495,0.1035,1.7023,3.951,1.5306,1.5778,2.2157,3.9213,2.5378,0.0087,0.4744,0.7864,3.7867,0.1285,1.04,4.4184,0.0007,5.4473,2.7129,1.3283,3.7965,1.2666,1.3103,1.4021,2.612,1.4726,0.7319,3.8655,2.5759,3.0643,0.7672,0.0005,0.5768,6.4436,0.168,1.7741,8.8074,0.0163,0.619,8.6891,0.6877,8.6875,3.6818,6.4846,7.5317,3.3426,4.1066,0.0172,0.3885,3.3015,2.4282,6.6748,0.4039,2.1554,1.29,1.2873,0.9146,0.0875,1.3455,3.6196,0.0452,1.222,6.2831,3.5019,5.5743,0.0006,3.5177,0.4539,3.9213,5.0341,0.5121,6.1389,1.9822,1.6584,0.1657,2.1439,5.6222,0.0006,1.1042,4.5075,0.0643,0.0528,1.0726,4.7139,5.5756,1.1807,4.6161,1.5911,1.5004,1.8979,5.9229,5.8034,2.2321,0.0892,0.8641,1.2145,0.8505,4.4705,2.26,3.1239,1.2667]}
{"prompt":"Indonesian President Joko Widodo has nominated the chief of staff of the air force to be the new head of the armed forces ( TNI ) , to replace a controversial general who is due","text":"Indonesian President Joko Widodo has nominated the chief of staff of the air force to be the new head of the armed forces ( TNI ), to replace a controversial general who is due to be sent to investigate alleged military killings of civilians in Sulawesi. In a decree, Jokowi, who had promised to make an army that is more professional and is willing to play a role as a guard of democracy, has appointed Marsekal Hadi Tjahjanto of the National Defence Academy's Army Cadet Cadet School to be the new head of the armed forces. President Jokowi says he appointed the general without an assessment of the military. The move was seen as a way to put him at ease following complaints from the international community that the army is still too close to hard-liners in the Pancasila. \"The president has respected Article 17 of the 1945 Constitution that stipulates that the role of the military in the administration of the state is only to maintain peace and national security, but not to play a role in other institutions, \" said a statement on the president's website. Since the army took power during the Jakarta coup in January, the president has attempted to introduce reforms geared toward building a professional army. The army has taken several measures to stop former president Suharto from reasserting his legacy, including seizing his family's private apartments and shutting down the Suharto foundation. The military also banned a book by author and critic of former president Suharto I Wayan Mardjana. The military arrested Mardjana on December 26, a week after a controversial article by the critic, which accused President Joko of failing to protect the rights of minorities. Mardjana had been in hiding since then, after his office had been accused by military officials of \" inciting secession.\" Meanwhile, the military continues to question the independence of the Indonesian Democratic Institute ( PDI-P ) amid investigations into the financing of the election. According to several reports, the National Investigation Agency (Bareskrim) had been investigating the election of PDI-P presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto and its chairman. TNI Chief of Staff Hadi Tjahjanto said Thursday that the party should clarify their sources of funding. In a video posted online on January 14, the head of the Indonesian national intelligence says he is investigating the financial background of Prabowo. After a series of protests, the army has finally suspended a planned review of the state of the armed forces, with Hadi Tjahjanto saying the review would now be postponed until the army chief completes a military report on corruption. Meanwhile, the police have begun an investigation into the alleged rape of a 13-year-old girl. Police say the incident happened in the early hours of January 23 and their first witness, who had spoken to police about the incident, was a 13-year-old girl herself. The girl told police that the perpetrator is a man she met through Facebook and later met to get into a car.

They can't run away from what they did and get away with it. \"\nThe move reflects growing frustration among US President Donald Trump s key allies and allies of US ally Peru after he s last-minute victory in the Jan 11 presidential elections left him with a weakened political position.\nWith the congressional vote now over, the opposition Congress has moved to block the government from acting on several of Kuczynski s appointments to Cabinet-level posts under his current term, including Mr Richard Torrellas, a former presidential candidate and current congressman.\nKuczinsky s position will also be testified to and will not be able to act on the cabinet appointments, although all he can do is not act. The Congress is not obligated to approve those appointments, but they may be able to block a cabinet appointment, but Congress requires an affirmative vote for Cabinet nominations as well as to block a Cabinet appointment, congressman Alberto de Belaunde, former deputy president and currently head of the Peruvian Congress, told Reuters.\n\"It's important to see that as the congressman and the leader of the opposition. I think that's the first, second, third, fourth, fifth thing,\" congressman Julio Rosas told Reuters on Saturday.\nOn Friday, the Peruvian Constitutional Court declared that congress has the authority to block the government s move to implement the cabinet appointments, with the next steps to be decided by the congress.\nRosas said the main aim of the opposition Congress is the removal of the President from office, but he said some of the opposition parties were also looking for possible parliamentary votes to remove the opposition leader.\nAccording to the Constitution, once the presidential election results are accepted by the Peruvian Electoral College, the election victory automatically takes effect in Congress, which has until the next Monday to take action on the Congress.\nThat would mean the opposition Congress has the right to stop the government while leaving the next Monday to decide whether to allow the government to continue working in the parliament and thus be able to pass any laws it wants.\nThe opposition party, Fuerza Popular, which is in favor of Kuczynski being removed from office, said that would be the correct and only way in which the president can be removed from office.\n\"This way we have to wait for Monday without any action, if the congress has to wait so long, it s just like a government with zero power. This is how the parliamentarian system works,\" Ramos said.\nIn recent times, the Peruvian Congress has been a victim of a major confrontation between the president and the Congress. One of the ways the congress was able to try to weaken the president was by taking actions towards the President s appointments, which eventually led to the presidential elections and was one of the main reasons why the president won.","token_len":635,"entropy":[11.2904,4.2832,3.5638,0.1102,0.0354,0.0132,0.0011,9.7101,8.141,7.8485,5.2634,2.9308,2.4306,4.4867,2.0224,7.4454,2.608,1.9603,3.4525,8.7664,5.6479,4.3417,1.6215,4.3405,0.6527,3.7589,0.9761,1.9469,2.6805,5.957,6.2502,1.2134,0.5978,1.5708,2.2454,2.8082,4.2301,6.2388,5.381,0.614,6.3924,0.886,0.1388,17.8464,1.7612,5.8912,1.9952,0.0181,4.3001,1.5737,1.5092,2.5129,4.959,5.9053,0.0017,0.001,5.354,1.0729,0.7502,3.1625,2.4104,1.667,0.108,18.0549,5.1738,16.4123,7.5529,2.0312,5.0784,1.1731,6.0426,3.2207,2.4285,4.4331,4.5646,2.0381,5.1915,1.1863,2.1502,3.5523,4.0397,1.8756,0.1264,0.0692,1.211,3.8151,2.1187,2.6166,2.4136,5.5806,2.9116,2.6603,1.2942,5.7317,4.4939,0.3661,0.0117,8.0784,7.5632,1.2205,2.6229,1.3378,3.8753,3.1655,5.345,3.3214,4.6462,3.345,6.1775,6.0203,5.4761,0.3097,5.5723,1.3586,1.3881,6.8,7.9194,1.4166,2.8499,9.8124,1.0794,2.0021,1.9416,4.9826,2.7242,2.7475,0.935,0.3424,5.1854,1.8168,6.3107,0.7873,3.0419,2.1417,0.1986,1.9935,4.0048,4.3802,1.8609,5.0649,0.8195,3.4645,1.7336,4.1101,1.054,5.3535,1.4953,6.343,2.0796,0.9493,0.002,0.003,0.9642,5.2118,2.4991,5.1216,5.7557,0.0208,0.9156,5.6913,1.8959,5.4076,2.1974,1.3291,1.3443,8.916,10.1933,8.7157,5.6655,3.8116,0.59,1.938,1.5186,5.6335,2.805,1.8194,3.3602,5.8028,1.4452,0.2178,2.7234,0.0516,6.9476,11.4975,2.3243,4.3218,3.3148,3.1722,0.9846,12.7874,1.4267,5.5323,3.8071,2.5627,0.4633,4.8384,0.0261,5.2681,1.143,2.1744,5.7301,1.6199,1.6308,4.8754,5.9866,5.7837,1.4792,0.1932,0.3704,5.9163,3.44,2.8189,2.842,5.825,2.371,3.4634,4.0116,0.0589,3.4823,5.0281,0.444,1.1838,1.4763,2.7985,3.4656,0.5387,6.0326,0.0213,3.53,3.8618,3.8132,1.4564,3.0391,4.2126,5.4662,7.212,4.2369,5.2764,0.3787,3.9285,4.03,3.186,5.2155,0.8897,1.2792,3.9172,3.0793,2.3069,2.1481,1.1395,3.1573,11.0383,5.7485,5.6801,6.2907,9.8766,1.345,2.7992,4.458,3.453,2.8968,2.2364,6.1712,3.298,0.0139,1.0343,5.5286,0.0069,4.4346,0.4298,0.6165,1.3821,0.616,0.1415,2.2312,2.4542,1.1584,3.6628,1.0658,3.941,1.1249,5.3152,2.2552,7.2349,3.6454,1.2356,3.6492,0.5016,0.5582,1.5555,4.4861,2.9217,1.5011,1.6752,1.8077,1.825,3.7898,5.958,2.3653,0.8196,0.5285,1.5402,0.6422,1.4179,0.2991,4.0607,2.6454,6.3302,5.564,6.3177,2.813,2.0766,0.4331,2.4089,0.6254,0.3723,0.4353,4.8005,1.6182,0.3132,1.784,3.5093,0.0051,5.2762,0.0389,4.6147,1.771,7.1438,3.0548,1.2807,2.0111,0.1538,2.5804,1.841,1.2139,1.6545,6.2599,1.2223,5.89,1.3131,4.0358,0.6356,1.2963,3.8629,1.2571,6.0839,3.5617,1.9603,1.0665,2.9783,1.1876,0.4328,3.9321,1.2071,0.413,4.9528,0.0043,0.669,1.3623,6.8312,3.8352,0.3295,0.3227,4.0461,1.2542,1.311,5.1424,1.4856,0.0196,1.7415,3.476,2.162,0.6813,1.4708,1.6037,1.9533,1.619,5.2637,1.7949,0.7238,3.4677,3.3022,2.7676,2.6233,4.3322,1.6775,6.818,5.9396,3.0856,0.8243,3.3512,1.327,5.6137,0.8041,0.4863,0.1941,6.3078,0.0043,1.8564,4.7441,0.4534,7.1525,1.3447,5.832,0.6038,4.1228,0.148,7.9043,2.0321,0.4921,4.8748,0.0108,4.472,1.8067,0.3559,1.0234,4.8744,8.3839,8.4173,3.4925,2.2077,3.4779,6.3034,1.7708,2.4496,2.3789,2.5939,2.7158,2.6842,5.1,0.3705,3.6326,2.0744,1.302,0.9854,7.4163,1.9211,0.335,5.8301,2.8733,1.582,1.6856,3.1484,2.0621,2.7812,1.3628,2.6634,0.0598,4.6975,0.9091,0.7141,7.9518,6.7555,0.7999,5.3981,3.5989,1.1738,3.6553,1.6229,0.5551,4.2329,0.9251,1.0645,0.4758,2.5014,5.0913,3.0915,1.1601,4.8997,3.2073,5.4785,4.1044,1.3189,0.0133,2.7071,2.786,3.8989,1.8883,1.7819,0.5402,0.248,1.775,2.1879,3.2965,2.2576,9.274,0.8514,0.2274,5.1778,0.8309,3.4932,1.9714,3.2434,4.0335,0.0151,2.1178,0.003,0.067,6.0126,0.8484,1.1147,0.475,0.2722,1.4895,3.2071,5.5446,1.5739,2.7273,6.1827,4.9455,2.921,0.3417,5.383,0.0791,1.031,3.584,2.2217,2.3446,0.5156,0.9028,0.1212,0.5293,0.2986,1.1696,2.6904,5.2704,2.7132,2.4487,2.164,4.6746,1.3623,6.8125,7.2082,1.8904,3.4598,2.6737,4.1195,2.1223,3.1224,3.4383,2.1308,5.1212,5.7578,0.5198,1.725,2.2628,6.2813,4.8282,2.9595,2.322,4.5113,4.189,7.1173,2.1967,2.4847,3.0221,0.8569,3.5145,1.6345,5.2137,8.6108,3.3431,0.5484,0.7154,9.0234,0.8726,0.4465,0.2329,3.4092,4.0078,4.8876,0.2039,1.2593,2.4007,0.0108,3.0152,0.184,1.6264,4.1449,6.2202,0.1838,2.3222,4.7548,7.1607,0.9495,0.9404,3.8524,0.5318,1.4231,3.5222,1.8975,5.4663,1.0219,0.4833,6.3194,1.1771,2.5436,3.4796,1.1714,0.0067,5.2651,0.3655,6.8514,0.7753,1.2633,1.5582,1.1408,4.2028,4.533,6.4702,1.1863,3.6763,2.8365,4.3513,1.4031,1.8046,6.5087,0.6857,0.0697,1.2852,6.2221,2.0795,3.6682,6.5023,4.5631,0.1586,0.1745,1.6001,0.9941,2.7,1.005,3.6076,3.7668,2.375]}
{"prompt":"Qatar will buy fighter jets and armored vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday , bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it","text":"Qatar will buy fighter jets and armored vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it seeks to assert its influence after the 2015 conflict with Qatar-allied Shiite Muslim Arab states.\nThe four-article deal, signed in Paris with French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammed bin Salman, includes the sale of six Dassault Rafale fighter jets, four of which will be delivered by 2025, with options for two more aircraft, plus related ground forces systems for the Saudis, who have long threatened to cut off Qatar, according to Reuters.\nAnother two Rafale fighters, which will carry a nuclear payload, are part of a multi-year deal that the Saudis have sought. All of the airplanes will be delivered from an undisclosed French site to the Saudi Air Force, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe first shipment is expected in 2025 and includes training and crew upgrades, Le Drian said at the news conference, which included the presentation of French defense equipment including drones and a shipment of naval batteries.\nLe Drian said France and its Arab allies \"will seek to put in place a comprehensive joint operation center and a joint operations table to prepare an integrated joint operations plan.\"\nThe agreement is one of a few French arms deals announced during the year. The deal will provide more than 1,200 weapons, including nearly 1,000 vehicles and armored personnel carriers and 200 fighter jets for the Saudis, France and the United Arab Emirates, which along with Qatar are at the center of the current dispute between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Doha.\nThe pact, which is part of France\u2019s long- term military presence in the Saudi Arabia in the post-Second World War Middle East, also includes training the Saudis' security forces and a deal for the purchase of frigates and submarines, although the latter were not included in the press conference and were revealed only later in an interview with a French newspaper.\nSaudi Arabia, the Gulf country's leading player, accuses Qatar of supporting terrorism and of funding dissidents within its conservative establishment. Doha denies any of those allegations and says the crisis with its neighbors has been caused by a Saudi-led coalition targeting its sovereignty and leading to its economic hardship.\nThe Arab alliance, comprised of Qatari and US allies and backed by Iran, launched a campaign of airstrikes against Qatar on June 5, seeking to drive it from the Gulf state and restore its long-standing foe to the region's fold, after the latter entered the US-allied coalition.\nAl-Saud vowed to block Qatar\u2019s diplomatic recognition by Arab nations if they do not pull the missiles back. The crisis intensified when Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates imposed \u201csanctions\u201d on Qatar that resulted in economic and trade sanctions on the South Asian Muslim nation.\nQatar has been accused of trying to expand its global influence, as well as funding militant groups and supporting Islamist extremism. But Qatar rejects those allegations, saying the crisis has been caused by its sovereign neighbors.","token_len":635,"entropy":[10.931,5.0677,6.4115,7.9091,0.2191,1.6116,4.6865,0.8138,4.196,1.9512,0.0006,10.6046,3.4586,6.7853,4.272,0.0612,6.9554,2.8628,5.9871,5.2617,2.0513,4.1815,3.3634,2.6148,1.3781,7.9408,0.0049,0.6622,1.8253,4.4559,2.5118,4.7039,5.0268,5.2319,4.3691,1.154,1.629,0.1693,4.6881,0.9431,1.0171,5.7048,1.9213,5.3952,5.0474,1.6318,4.7057,6.6037,2.582,0.1144,6.5852,2.253,5.8058,1.7996,0.4134,0.233,13.9306,6.7235,0.6148,9.7212,1.1004,1.6208,1.8846,1.3382,2.7852,3.4485,1.9955,3.6842,0.0198,0.2183,0.0213,0.0056,0.0,0.0172,0.0023,0.0,1.2597,3.6529,4.4886,0.0094,0.5832,3.2503,0.0317,0.0987,0.2609,3.3434,2.6877,3.4277,0.0514,4.4159,6.8878,0.0289,0.3371,0.0441,1.0122,0.0424,1.1125,2.6171,4.1862,0.3258,1.5872,0.4084,2.4567,1.2806,6.9215,0.8952,3.7859,6.2505,0.4929,4.0255,0.4464,3.973,2.5279,5.5411,8.9693,6.1754,2.1381,9.4422,3.3905,1.6723,6.2061,1.7723,4.0666,1.5706,3.2716,6.2536,0.4491,2.7216,0.8785,3.7538,4.1783,3.6192,0.0013,3.5688,0.1472,0.1873,7.1422,3.9389,3.2536,0.1294,2.2114,1.6336,2.304,1.4596,4.4896,2.6103,5.7686,3.2241,0.546,2.1491,4.3244,0.001,0.9368,4.6754,0.1634,1.9983,2.2355,2.0408,3.6079,1.6191,1.6094,4.127,4.041,5.8687,1.705,0.5678,6.2959,1.1005,0.3617,1.3531,3.5953,4.6226,3.0959,5.5066,5.7117,4.5878,2.1155,2.5116,3.8018,0.0446,1.9747,1.9549,0.002,3.8568,3.6296,0.6188,0.3616,0.0622,0.0082,0.0007,0.6563,0.3091,1.4842,4.8893,4.1722,2.6963,1.0089,2.4735,4.4162,2.1819,3.8057,6.9648,1.2817,7.0169,4.6909,1.289,10.2581,0.0091,0.0005,0.3583,2.9986,1.2382,4.0444,0.0285,1.805,2.6656,4.2741,2.511,6.5024,0.0728,5.6405,4.2602,2.9899,4.3331,4.6962,0.9831,3.4144,10.1465,0.0684,6.2103,5.8077,0.8655,0.5383,4.0578,0.0092,0.0006,1.0702,3.6441,3.2413,3.683,4.1995,0.2108,3.4093,1.5657,5.1473,0.8006,5.4487,4.1526,0.0262,1.5377,3.2206,5.8336,4.6119,5.5834,2.5381,2.9707,2.8848,4.2335,9.2322,1.6734,4.5645,4.8478,3.3146,4.8321,3.5872,1.385,2.4562,0.2921,1.6311,3.632,2.3903,3.7564,0.1814,2.356,4.913,5.4853,3.6218,0.6927,3.8643,3.1621,0.5355,3.4262,2.9491,1.8601,2.0741,2.8601,3.5354,3.8971,0.4296,3.7564,0.6192,2.1982,4.9693,1.6831,0.8843,5.9578,1.9833,0.0482,0.8766,5.7052,1.2029,4.109,1.665,0.0055,3.0008,4.7847,2.8558,0.1399,3.3856,1.1231,2.3772,0.8311,4.7233,3.5792,1.4302,0.6637,0.1149,0.0003,0.9284,2.6129,5.0706,0.0007,1.3948,2.1331,5.2354,1.9194,1.4372,0.0163,1.2695,4.0326,3.0889,2.5279,1.0118,2.2745,2.5534,0.002,5.0449,1.9663,7.7827,0.0034,0.6582,0.2412,1.477,5.9517,2.67,0.8367,2.1073,3.1927,0.0025,3.0816,17.829,8.7747,2.4188,4.1277,0.1535,10.7317,2.5391,5.7688,0.2144,0.1812,5.7046,2.3085,5.42,0.9997,6.6862,0.0363,8.2566,1.9914,0.0014,2.9222,0.0269,0.3037,2.204,0.7916,5.1066,5.33,1.3088,3.9918,4.4782,0.0786,1.441,3.3983,4.7384,1.8827,2.0133,2.0124,0.0842,8.5237,0.0019,1.0909,3.2816,1.867,5.1488,1.4824,4.3985,3.1042,1.3975,1.7712,0.5781,0.1476,9.9988,1.2882,4.5507,1.5738,7.9845,2.1124,3.9696,1.8548,4.5343,2.3063,0.5486,3.9663,0.7815,1.2854,0.367,0.235,2.1892,0.2607,2.3732,2.5209,3.582,4.2949,2.446,4.6744,6.79,3.077,6.5337,0.6372,0.2118,1.8442,1.0423,0.9109,4.015,4.052,9.0973,5.9221,1.1186,8.2289,7.9866,0.6205,5.501,0.158,1.5017,1.9612,7.2362,2.7004,0.9748,1.5477,2.2292,1.7629,6.8879,3.4878,5.3889,1.2533,1.9421,1.7678,2.2358,0.1982,2.0986,3.398,0.9757,0.0588,2.9184,5.6962,3.3264,5.6981,1.3241,8.3964,0.5528,3.0989,5.472,6.8044,0.3158,0.3322,1.9199,6.0139,4.4581,1.9158,7.0002,0.2365,8.7043,0.0095,1.7279,5.0364,1.1407,2.5266,6.0873,0.1179,2.5188,0.4104,6.1072,1.0975,2.2229,1.5521,3.0295,0.9321,1.3757,2.7824,2.9899,3.4833,1.1414,5.2997,0.1727,3.3124,1.3435,1.5422,0.965,3.2738,4.058,2.0962,5.1251,1.3835,5.9529,0.2566,1.3418,9.9267,2.1725,2.5382,2.8604,1.623,5.5547,2.6669,4.4269,1.7426,6.2433,6.6981,1.0907,7.6086,0.8962,4.2943,0.0006,4.2046,1.8903,0.5816,5.2015,1.5537,4.0771,0.5761,8.1321,0.9093,4.7074,3.0107,8.7783,0.0476,0.0039,6.3199,5.6454,6.6052,6.9459,2.0414,2.5488,2.7567,2.0283,0.0283,6.1033,3.1761,8.6996,5.0293,1.3334,2.665,6.6767,5.4267,2.6506,2.039,0.2173,2.1481,5.3451,0.0025,0.0012,4.7075,16.1749,5.7077,7.4699,0.0178,1.6025,6.1242,0.6464,0.208,4.361,5.2747,0.0098,6.8481,1.7685,4.8419,0.3709,1.8984,1.4642,8.2136,0.8675,7.9794,1.3122,0.7886,0.6074,2.5148,0.0413,1.7987,2.438,3.1657,0.2848,4.9163,0.0108,4.4087,0.1168,6.4851,0.985,2.1716,4.371,0.9567,0.0475,5.4999,4.6069,0.3524,1.8853,3.1425,3.3448,5.0903,0.7856,4.5951,3.412,6.1118,2.7507,1.3931,1.4126,1.227,2.0443,4.9859,1.9536,1.1079,0.7809,0.1891,2.2863,5.4716,7.1163,1.4127]}
{"prompt":"Russian lawmakers who visited Pyongyang said North Korea was not prepared to disarm , and while it did not want nuclear war it is morally ready for it , Russia s RIA news agency reported","text":"Russian lawmakers who visited Pyongyang said North Korea was not prepared to disarm, and while it did not want nuclear war it is morally ready for it, Russia s RIA news agency reported.\nIf President Trump and Donald Trump play their cards right that the US government might be able to achieve what they want without having to deploy American troops. According to the US president s chief of staff John Kelly last week on NBC s Face the Nation program North Korea s nuclear weapons program is much more sophisticated than when previous presidents have investigated the matter and he said that the US military s intelligence reports on those weapons are far more accurate today than they were.\nThat s a remarkable claim that the nuclear weapons have fallen off the radar screen. But some experts say the Trump administration will not be able to reach that conclusion unless it has complete and open access to nuclear weapons.\nThe US government says it has to play the nuclear card to show North Korea it s still capable of retaliating. It also could be using it as a bargaining chip to pressure China into helping to topple the current political regime in Pyongyang. If the nuclear card can be used as a bargaining chip by the US and if it s working well it could provide a win for Trump.\nSo far Trump s strategy has not worked. This week North Korea says it s still not ready to disarm. Donald Trump s strategy has not kept him out of more trouble with President Kim Jong Un.\nSo Trump s strategy can change. This weekend Donald Trump and President Kim Jong Un signed the North Korean surrender agreement at the Punggye-ri Peaceful Reunification Demonstration Area on the south side of the Korean border. Here are the reasons for this decision. The United States and North Korea both have military weapons that can cause great suffering.\nIf you get caught on a nuclear warhead you re a dead man. And if you get caught on a ballistic missile it s even worse. The most recent war the most deadly occurred in 1998 in Iraq when Saddam Hussein s weapons of mass destruction were found to be there. That s the kind of suffering I can imagine my children or grandchildren might experience.\nThis is what Trump s administration is trying to create. But these actions and rhetoric could easily turn into realpolitik. In realpolitik if you cannot convince North Korea to disarm you will need more than a sign and more than a speech.\nThe President s chief of staff John Kelly said last week that because there is no certainty in terms of North Korea s nuclear policy there is not the same confidence for military strategy. But the president s top intelligence officer is more optimistic. At a recent forum where Trump s national security adviser, John Bolton, was moderated by a conservative US state college professor in Georgia, the US intelligence community s chairman, Dan Coats, said that in the case of North Korea if Kim Jong Un decides to play hard ball and get military action up the escalating level of the confrontation, then he may actually destroy all of his nuclear weapons, he said.\nWhat if that s not possible. But if I were Donald Trump, as President, I would put a price on his head.","token_len":635,"entropy":[9.7594,3.9202,6.0772,5.2199,3.208,4.325,0.3059,2.0315,3.6239,3.7543,0.2491,7.6026,2.1117,1.9412,7.7791,2.3223,2.8029,0.6473,3.8818,5.2875,3.7226,4.8333,4.4261,9.5734,6.7123,2.5514,2.7918,2.8039,6.4153,10.4345,10.8397,1.8831,2.3257,0.0391,0.4956,0.739,0.3957,15.6365,5.4667,0.9219,4.0048,8.5534,0.0463,7.1827,2.1045,0.1301,0.2294,6.6563,2.5834,2.7977,4.9994,5.1158,2.1641,2.3409,0.0293,6.5582,4.4567,2.0141,1.0285,2.5932,3.0976,0.2966,6.0988,4.0129,0.9455,4.5977,6.686,0.0046,1.584,2.7419,5.0984,6.9252,7.7927,0.7146,0.088,2.9193,0.1278,6.7407,0.6941,5.5836,3.9777,5.6552,5.6064,0.1616,0.0005,7.194,6.9886,0.1687,3.8443,4.164,1.8863,2.4317,3.7058,6.104,0.8663,4.1791,0.3985,6.9318,7.0076,1.5877,2.4122,9.3081,2.0297,2.851,2.715,6.164,1.9305,2.1523,1.929,0.9604,3.4841,7.6069,5.4241,5.0206,2.1645,6.2949,2.8164,1.8683,4.2933,0.7465,1.4219,6.5045,0.9316,0.9885,0.1223,4.1799,0.5218,5.6919,2.2176,3.6531,7.064,3.9004,3.0492,2.3479,6.1886,2.347,4.3542,7.2199,3.5061,0.8817,1.8923,2.4912,2.2215,3.3824,5.7078,2.0476,1.6107,1.8259,4.4809,0.3431,3.7908,1.8315,1.5359,0.7343,0.0707,4.888,2.6368,1.4603,3.4912,1.3476,2.921,6.8266,2.3411,5.2283,1.4699,0.0544,3.3454,1.0647,1.1581,0.759,2.1623,2.2598,3.0352,4.7129,1.2682,1.3384,5.2444,6.4924,2.5954,3.0446,0.6075,2.4214,6.0655,4.31,0.0331,3.7257,3.9201,5.491,1.1771,0.0902,9.5845,0.0824,1.873,2.9985,2.8158,6.1228,2.6977,3.909,3.8469,1.5654,0.7056,1.745,0.0959,1.0273,4.4048,3.0374,2.9055,5.5486,2.5818,6.5451,1.129,4.5559,5.7343,1.0555,1.591,0.8134,0.486,4.2126,1.5585,5.0856,3.7595,4.5166,0.4037,1.6957,1.9763,0.8028,0.0469,0.0436,4.1231,1.0493,0.8818,2.4105,5.7865,1.5834,3.0267,4.052,3.2885,2.5238,1.3043,4.251,1.2915,6.5122,0.8728,3.1063,2.4536,0.6075,4.8097,2.0409,3.0646,2.3075,6.578,1.1162,2.2483,0.5082,0.9981,4.8633,2.6745,5.4547,0.1178,4.8494,0.5826,2.6474,3.7425,2.7073,1.1762,0.3037,4.4697,1.1503,6.6539,0.057,1.6743,5.422,0.8048,0.2984,10.5663,5.4234,3.3867,0.0782,6.494,2.2579,3.5909,6.7834,1.8882,0.2995,0.1527,1.5877,1.5415,4.048,4.1427,1.4557,2.1528,4.0837,5.8025,2.0969,4.0617,4.9142,4.8257,0.0345,3.8809,5.0994,0.3996,0.194,0.0231,4.8809,2.5612,2.4787,0.7429,6.3604,1.7358,3.4548,0.6264,9.9784,0.0122,0.0011,0.0009,0.0,6.043,3.5595,1.5499,0.242,0.0062,8.8959,0.0595,9.5317,3.2633,0.5377,5.3158,1.3453,0.0156,0.3942,1.4512,2.1715,0.4456,6.4873,2.6081,1.5441,5.3714,1.7531,2.9374,4.3766,0.9603,3.769,3.5131,0.0413,2.0865,1.3826,0.0155,4.6279,2.84,4.8118,5.1962,2.3902,1.2754,5.0628,3.4485,4.2566,1.8008,1.7348,4.9145,3.0031,5.963,3.5441,3.4782,2.2831,3.4045,3.1693,1.5925,2.2419,7.657,5.0863,4.9339,2.2122,1.6056,4.1336,1.1329,0.2341,1.4576,0.3742,0.4501,0.3857,3.6933,0.0166,3.4715,2.0675,5.6335,0.7746,0.276,2.4667,4.8469,2.6419,5.289,5.5012,6.7764,3.5908,6.8624,0.7667,4.3472,2.3055,4.6487,2.9452,2.3675,0.0999,1.55,3.2824,0.5263,0.0037,0.0023,1.8658,4.0058,3.4892,0.5864,4.6471,0.9462,3.9502,0.5568,2.6488,5.6035,0.108,8.9512,6.1562,4.3408,2.646,7.3808,2.3595,5.1094,0.9701,3.4276,1.2984,1.2486,0.8939,3.1141,1.5798,2.8014,3.2059,0.8757,7.6056,2.0603,1.5361,0.0493,5.4837,0.6997,4.5739,5.4623,3.4004,4.1296,4.3371,3.8924,4.5407,3.2417,0.9246,3.5777,5.018,0.0023,0.9978,3.9107,5.4763,0.4423,0.0059,4.8469,1.8703,5.6415,3.9937,2.6339,0.1987,1.3156,1.6265,3.0742,2.2958,4.4493,4.7145,2.6964,1.5649,6.9882,3.1673,5.2495,0.4995,0.7482,5.6538,0.9222,1.4336,2.4531,4.8379,1.0917,6.0335,0.189,0.0337,0.6555,0.0291,1.8184,2.3326,0.0917,0.6055,6.7498,3.7633,0.9364,0.6525,7.0717,3.278,4.2202,0.0088,3.0133,0.0653,0.3871,1.5238,7.2261,3.4759,0.8604,2.9797,2.9265,3.9071,4.9231,6.0474,4.7908,5.653,1.3126,3.5211,2.543,2.6683,0.9683,5.1474,5.1284,1.2782,4.066,4.7935,4.0456,2.1996,5.2277,1.512,2.7039,4.8424,5.6714,3.3048,0.6475,4.1621,0.0209,0.6671,2.8487,4.1906,3.1317,0.8376,2.2634,5.882,0.6618,0.44,3.4371,5.6327,7.5111,5.7395,6.4458,0.5946,4.5987,6.1033,1.0107,2.3165,3.0728,3.0836,0.6985,3.1128,7.3042,1.7497,5.7828,0.0047,0.0001,0.2884,0.7221,1.0638,4.3059,1.3004,3.4547,0.1572,0.7031,0.0198,5.941,4.8141,1.0556,0.0518,4.7893,0.2695,6.3123,4.1592,3.3603,2.2117,3.6012,6.3023,2.3216,7.6327,3.0255,9.1457,5.4583,0.356,2.812,5.8869,2.0332,2.2504,2.0568,3.2667,4.5555,7.8125,4.5574,1.0049,2.3727,1.7701,0.8561,3.5221,3.7595,0.3376,0.1488,0.6797,4.3972,3.946,2.5942,3.5358,2.9094,3.7356,2.4861,3.921,1.8866,4.7099,4.6672,4.2107,0.1035,2.6557,5.1878,3.8249,1.5382,0.833,0.477,4.6763,2.3599,4.6721,0.2162,4.4,0.5336,1.0164]}
{"prompt":"An Israeli siren phone application sounded that rockets were fired at Israel at various locations near the Gaza Strip on Thursday but there was no initial confirmation of any hits in Israel , the military","text":"An Israeli siren phone application sounded that rockets were fired at Israel at various locations near the Gaza Strip on Thursday but there was no initial confirmation of any hits in Israel, the military said. \u201cAs I reported last night, the security director in Tel Aviv in charge of our operational information received an Israeli siren phone call. Israeli siren phone messages are often false \u201c, the spokesman of the Israeli military said on Twitter. At 10:18, there was a message from a phone in the city of Ashkelon, west of Tel Aviv, which said \u201cwe were hit by rockets, they came on the ground, at that point, we fired our air defence system. Ashkelon is a small industrial area and not the center of the military infrastructure, the army spokesman said. \u201cThere was no military target. We will investigate the matter\u201d, the army spokesman added. The army of Israel does not publish the exact coordinates of Hamas\u2019 rockets that hit civilian areas, and it also uses civilian vehicles as targets \u2013 in September last year, a rogue anti-shipping missile hit an industrial complex in Ashkelon, injuring a civilian and forcing schools in the southern city to close \u2013 but there is an abundance of videos that show rocket fire directed at the southern shore of the sea by the groups of Gaza. Earlier this week, the military had said a rocket that hit Ashkelon was fired from the coastal village of Beit Lahia, west of the Israeli city, without mentioning the exact location of the shooting. At 8pm local time, the army said a ballistic missile fired from Gaza was directed towards a commercial center in the city of Ashdod, south of Tel Aviv and its east. Ashdod is not known for its civilian infrastructure but an army spokesman referred to it as an industrial area close to the Israeli border. The army said a Hamas rocket hit a house in Beit Lahiya, a small Arab village west of Ashkelon, south of Tel Aviv.\nPrevious: United States President Trump says that he has tested negative for the Coronavirus on Thursday after having experienced symptoms of the respiratory illness.\nNext: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to go very, very far\u201d, he told reporters, adding that \u201cthe price was set out,\u201d Trump, who was criticized by his critics, also criticized his rivals for being \u201cless than honest,\u201d saying \u201cthe other one had his fingers out, he wanted to make the deal easy\u201d.\nThe president made the announcement on the plane that brought him back from Washington DC, where he made his daily announcement.\nPresident Trump: I had a very good trip to Washington.

Very good agreement, very clear language for us to have the very best relationship in the world in terms of trade.","token_len":636,"entropy":[9.4558,9.8072,1.8246,8.1199,7.664,6.312,5.3957,11.6265,0.8595,1.6736,1.7265,2.0559,3.6523,5.8304,1.4462,4.5508,0.819,2.2256,0.584,2.2435,2.2527,6.1258,3.385,0.616,0.0658,6.191,2.1427,0.7008,1.9946,6.7409,4.1615,1.9507,2.2975,1.9364,3.001,0.2085,0.1782,13.7252,6.0009,7.7973,5.2561,3.7373,3.058,1.2052,0.2247,1.8779,6.9098,7.2176,3.7271,3.2062,0.006,5.8002,2.5776,0.0122,6.2817,6.8767,5.1522,5.1441,1.3645,4.1137,1.4248,0.0033,1.7396,0.6281,2.9022,6.036,2.8673,1.3308,1.3573,6.2713,1.6701,3.5651,7.1091,8.9469,0.0617,5.3735,3.1393,4.5244,2.305,0.4254,1.869,1.7707,1.0424,3.2351,3.5858,0.3558,5.3613,5.4683,0.3637,4.5879,3.9803,4.4779,0.5502,0.7308,4.4799,0.8976,1.7405,4.1391,2.6042,1.0813,4.9002,0.3653,2.8644,0.3686,0.0001,1.7578,6.0639,0.0179,1.4791,0.0171,0.5945,2.4419,1.0955,6.0208,0.3853,5.3804,3.8715,1.5301,0.9286,2.0814,3.2869,5.5872,4.26,5.5576,1.9961,2.9058,2.3039,5.2747,5.5855,1.6702,2.359,2.3405,6.1277,3.3064,4.6769,2.4594,1.0437,1.8675,9.1405,0.0199,0.0017,1.1664,1.867,3.2805,6.2324,1.7667,2.4272,4.4819,3.3952,3.4545,0.0544,1.213,4.8752,4.6966,2.3437,3.4857,4.1157,1.4321,0.2726,0.4145,1.0038,0.0497,2.811,0.9547,0.533,5.4754,5.5686,2.7257,1.7109,4.0609,3.1088,1.9949,2.6312,9.0867,7.9177,4.4018,1.0187,2.3277,0.2138,1.6069,0.1541,2.4437,2.8595,6.9635,1.0024,5.0762,0.0285,6.0229,1.919,4.048,3.3809,0.184,7.6641,10.8459,5.5729,9.6646,2.7484,1.4521,6.3118,1.1805,1.5057,2.6588,2.463,4.0799,6.7809,4.8714,4.1034,1.7233,3.9521,7.5508,3.7284,7.3358,3.1205,0.0078,0.3904,2.5484,10.2938,5.4357,0.0032,7.1935,4.2189,1.8232,2.1009,2.1929,5.9549,2.8918,0.3829,3.0239,0.0784,0.0006,1.1386,3.2118,3.2336,3.6437,2.3417,4.149,9.3787,2.9615,0.6011,3.9764,1.4032,0.6987,0.3578,5.3516,1.7135,3.348,1.7848,3.4216,5.1433,0.0064,5.9769,2.6663,0.6963,3.3042,1.4219,5.4524,0.3739,2.1855,4.759,8.5893,0.3254,0.4262,3.4628,5.2162,2.2977,5.375,3.3576,4.0293,4.517,6.1983,0.8126,1.1703,0.1087,1.9073,2.8876,4.1436,2.1849,3.6032,1.3849,3.6151,1.1641,2.9402,0.0166,0.0032,1.3595,0.7817,0.6305,1.6157,3.1524,5.0417,0.0295,3.4201,0.1977,2.3155,1.283,1.1763,4.0337,0.0024,1.4399,2.8953,2.0953,3.6525,6.0663,5.2948,1.3551,3.3418,0.3402,1.1691,0.1611,6.2665,0.3061,4.8171,3.2858,4.6201,2.7831,0.0078,1.3847,1.4836,2.228,1.9651,2.1043,6.7955,0.0239,1.4333,0.4608,0.9169,1.8219,5.4535,2.4209,2.9332,5.2016,3.8719,0.5387,1.1546,1.9713,0.2856,1.6725,2.1017,0.0007,1.0478,2.6766,0.0663,1.5343,0.0037,3.7939,5.636,5.6141,3.2536,6.4373,0.1634,0.0008,0.8528,4.2135,4.2704,1.2893,0.4736,4.5447,3.142,3.1783,4.6093,3.6373,0.798,5.9787,0.5221,1.3582,0.0965,2.1307,1.4195,1.0494,6.427,0.0548,0.5221,1.7564,1.1959,0.3583,1.7866,2.1327,1.8038,2.8316,4.3285,0.9253,2.0499,1.4891,4.9332,0.4213,2.8685,0.0069,1.0999,5.3638,1.3279,3.16,3.0294,7.1643,1.5536,3.3516,0.0019,1.9091,2.7422,0.0033,0.912,5.2214,0.0046,0.9384,0.0024,0.8732,3.2656,14.1088,3.3258,7.454,0.8522,5.521,3.4598,3.3019,4.0603,2.8102,2.5238,9.3452,6.214,0.2249,2.0378,12.6805,2.2394,1.5164,0.7204,4.8778,5.6156,4.1404,4.3149,6.7785,3.0316,0.6976,1.3125,6.4927,2.0876,1.3121,1.71,5.4628,0.0165,10.5119,3.4004,4.9647,11.3053,8.3168,3.2398,3.3517,0.0836,3.3875,0.8041,3.7238,6.2416,1.3175,0.0035,2.9998,0.972,2.3267,1.5379,3.6066,1.8346,0.7076,3.2611,1.8354,0.2512,6.4442,0.8575,2.6189,9.1531,4.5838,6.0487,5.9444,3.4442,5.9164,2.2747,7.7001,4.4149,0.8862,2.1166,7.0011,1.3432,2.7561,3.687,2.2443,3.6131,4.9037,2.9364,6.3596,0.7426,3.3186,10.8352,0.799,6.0846,2.7235,3.261,2.8212,0.679,1.772,3.2816,3.7706,0.1701,2.4672,5.229,5.4462,4.0928,5.7305,5.8199,4.5635,2.4722,3.5046,4.2657,0.3008,2.6407,3.1729,4.1422,6.1593,2.6477,0.8177,1.0454,0.751,2.7865,3.1511,4.4047,1.0269,3.2034,1.9206,2.4288,4.9336,1.8901,5.7751,0.4447,3.5511,0.9469,4.6853,4.9293,1.6882,1.323,0.1211,5.0972,1.656,6.3114,6.2428,2.4873,1.109,3.61,0.4664,4.7248,2.1899,3.8059,0.9578,1.2879,1.2332,3.3488,2.1707,2.6393,1.8828,2.6885,1.6125,0.5535,1.3082,0.3118,5.3577,4.9544,1.4641,1.7333,2.1854,1.5714,5.1644,1.4061,4.3255,0.2873,3.8079,3.0625,1.0773,1.8124,2.8518,1.481,1.9497,2.2222,1.7896,4.062,2.098,1.8064,0.7109,5.2994,1.1182,1.6348,0.7979,2.9659,2.906,1.1201,8.361,2.1355,6.8175,5.4884,4.2699,4.0663,4.0498,0.8197,3.6829,2.3168,0.5238,3.0783,1.2846,1.6417,2.8984,4.8152,5.0573,0.033,0.4289,3.9359,0.7127,3.9507,3.024,1.3797,7.8855,1.7402,4.5929,1.7745,0.8333,5.9124,4.0808,4.6324,2.0718,1.2065,3.2446,4.2108,5.3941,2.0049,1.5301,2.6953,0.2373,0.1327,4.4332,1.0121,0.0034,2.3407,1.3256]}
{"prompt":"Former Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq , an ex-air force pilot and former presidential candidate , said on Wednesday he intended to run in the presidential election early next year and would return to Cairo","text":"Former Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, an ex-air force pilot and former presidential candidate, said on Wednesday he intended to run in the presidential election early next year and would return to Cairo to campaign.\n\"It may be early spring next year if God grants us health,\" Shafiq, 64, told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nShafiq, who served in the military junta from June 1981 to February 1982, was one of the leading opponents of the former president Hosni Mubarak's regime when he resigned in February 2011 amid massive protests against his grip over the state.\nShafiq, who has not formally declared his intentions yet, said he had already begun a publicity campaign for his bid, urging his supporters and opponents alike \"to join together in the construction of the future nation\".\nThe Egyptian military says it has no plans to rule the country for a longer than one term.\nShafiq ran against then-President Hosni Mubarak and former premier Rafik al-Shafei in the April 2011 presidential elections and lost to al-Shafei with 44.7 percent of the votes.\nThe military-backed government replaced then-PM Mubarak with Mohammed Morsy, a former head of Shafiq's party, in March 2012. Morsy served for less than 18 months before quitting the post himself.\nShafiq, who did not seek the presidency in the latest elections because he had not declared his candidacy, has said he will run again in October, and that he plans to return to Cairo to campaign.\nShafiq, who in September 2012 was awarded the National Order of the Republic, the country's third-highest decoration, said his most important task now was to establish a political agreement or national consensus, and work to bring the nation together.\n\"Make the youth and people not to believe in their own words but believe in the political vision,\" he said.\nThe nation's powerful central bank will take over the management of the country's economic affairs until a new president is voted in and in place.\nMr Morsy created a ministry specifically for Egypt's economy called the Ministry of Investment and Development, which he himself heads.\n\"The ministry is responsible for promoting the investment environment, economic development and poverty reduction,\" he told reporters on January 1.\nEgypt recently saw a surge in oil extraction, with production crossing three million barrels per day this year, its highest in a decade.\nBut oil prices remain low.\nThe economy's strong growth and continued fiscal deficit are also an issue - Egypt's budget deficit has more than doubled since 2011, reaching 7.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2014.\nStill, Morsy insists he has no intention of pushing for radical economic reforms this year following a weak performance in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\"The current economic situation calls for strong, determined efforts, and we must avoid making the investment process complicated or the process slow,\" Morsy said during a conference last month.\nHe later clarified that he did not mean radical reforms, which he has said the current government is unlikely to pursue.","token_len":636,"entropy":[10.2944,5.0878,0.0067,3.4527,2.314,0.1495,0.5977,1.9612,5.0781,4.3736,0.0481,6.1298,0.5617,4.1732,1.6553,1.5595,6.0129,0.6876,0.7935,2.238,1.986,2.4798,2.2998,5.848,0.0428,4.1558,2.5605,1.0375,2.7748,0.4083,7.7135,0.1754,0.0884,3.7819,2.7903,5.5058,0.3256,3.6097,1.7303,3.3553,1.9544,0.2562,11.0478,3.6591,5.4266,0.6242,5.3782,6.3239,5.393,0.0205,4.9832,7.9176,5.0254,2.0256,8.7269,4.1648,0.8756,0.0021,0.0002,3.0481,5.9731,0.0024,0.8751,2.3941,2.3168,1.6813,1.2098,0.0746,0.5307,0.4532,14.3376,0.0378,0.0003,1.3487,0.4877,3.547,1.3158,0.4608,1.7862,8.0389,0.0983,1.7171,6.6463,6.2462,0.2244,2.7728,3.4194,0.2,1.9122,3.3334,0.0053,0.9797,3.8341,3.3451,0.1068,0.8307,4.1397,1.735,2.7189,0.0001,0.0001,2.7673,2.9179,4.1656,0.3415,3.5737,0.9604,2.3393,1.3892,3.3615,5.8973,0.3352,1.8921,0.7705,7.7865,5.3335,1.3529,3.5736,0.439,0.1708,9.4335,0.0112,0.0003,1.5529,0.423,2.1271,3.5094,4.0739,1.4946,0.5567,3.0599,3.8875,0.0814,1.2492,0.6083,2.1756,3.3569,3.9061,2.3973,8.3333,0.4037,1.9602,1.1593,3.0309,2.0548,4.6295,2.7432,0.247,4.1267,3.73,2.692,6.3634,0.1249,3.5034,3.3363,1.5853,1.5915,10.3167,0.0776,2.3836,4.0643,5.9875,1.5084,0.1224,5.504,3.0613,1.8325,3.5654,0.9966,1.0118,3.7378,1.1974,0.1207,5.9315,2.7429,0.6464,2.153,2.6513,6.373,0.736,3.9941,5.1897,1.3616,0.6404,3.4394,0.0229,0.0003,6.3425,2.4578,3.706,0.4872,1.2503,0.9292,0.0007,0.0015,2.9812,3.0356,4.4727,3.7803,0.0331,5.1143,0.0014,5.6429,13.413,0.2595,1.167,0.9254,4.505,1.8568,1.0841,1.9374,2.8359,2.9729,1.6896,4.093,0.0128,0.2716,2.9097,0.0014,4.5694,4.5109,0.7335,2.7463,0.6403,0.2698,0.0256,3.7151,0.6312,0.4549,2.5434,2.7485,4.6113,0.6658,3.3465,6.9431,6.509,0.1636,4.0631,2.2024,0.799,4.7847,4.2125,4.8915,0.0051,0.7436,1.6525,0.7469,3.9436,0.0114,7.4957,0.4436,0.0008,0.025,2.352,1.1042,1.838,2.5339,1.2286,0.6805,1.5671,0.0004,0.0012,5.1825,2.9219,4.6968,0.0043,5.0549,0.0733,1.7641,4.5474,2.6171,3.4541,8.2815,1.1906,0.3037,2.9598,0.0222,0.0004,1.948,0.5569,5.0471,0.0519,3.6176,1.9002,0.6246,1.8853,2.4594,5.6848,2.1713,5.4026,1.3574,2.2081,2.4198,3.2736,0.4801,3.0801,0.6443,1.9547,2.4177,0.4807,1.3877,2.269,3.0049,1.4967,4.7982,2.4557,3.1972,2.6848,0.5313,2.7869,0.0537,3.5328,0.103,1.477,1.1306,1.0209,1.085,0.4618,4.4187,0.0526,0.0004,1.8919,0.3903,5.5414,4.182,2.3772,2.6462,4.0478,0.3315,4.679,5.8065,0.081,1.2919,5.8317,1.8791,2.1031,2.4238,0.007,5.5509,0.5454,0.857,3.7549,0.2858,1.8709,2.9865,7.0224,0.8774,1.2573,3.9262,0.8106,0.402,4.3903,0.9586,2.5098,7.6484,7.3697,5.2693,3.782,3.341,2.2072,6.3098,1.9947,3.2874,1.7951,3.8335,0.9016,0.8468,0.2785,1.2238,8.1676,2.2943,8.8795,2.9872,3.3559,6.4197,4.7513,4.5377,1.3701,3.8198,1.6208,5.848,3.1719,4.8881,0.1741,0.9182,4.7227,5.8303,2.3077,0.2177,0.2863,0.6535,0.5788,2.961,7.0287,1.2632,6.6846,5.3042,1.2943,4.2639,4.0958,1.9589,1.4021,6.9498,0.0841,0.7967,1.0679,0.1793,6.0602,1.5791,3.9651,3.8256,0.7233,2.2709,0.8752,8.6453,0.2332,3.6479,4.8007,4.3231,1.0831,0.786,6.9425,1.7424,0.0129,0.003,9.2354,1.4244,7.0843,7.3542,0.4932,3.1929,0.1305,2.4192,5.6306,0.5608,3.0223,0.181,4.8181,0.8409,1.6856,1.0595,1.0592,2.6489,7.1159,5.5209,0.5507,0.6365,2.3195,1.913,3.547,1.8776,2.7352,0.0822,3.9671,1.0972,5.9602,4.8781,1.6981,3.799,0.7314,0.6475,7.8638,0.8158,1.424,1.4313,1.7853,1.8611,2.0099,6.1525,3.236,0.3609,0.4335,2.9045,7.943,4.7906,1.0826,2.8499,0.103,4.4811,7.2815,1.6593,1.7862,3.6902,10.0735,5.6674,1.3502,0.0438,0.7381,0.0038,3.7975,0.1948,1.1927,4.751,0.7662,3.2548,2.7286,0.2158,0.4315,0.7813,4.0993,3.6666,0.9926,3.2974,2.1188,3.4421,1.1473,2.8027,4.145,4.77,6.1667,2.1929,2.5505,6.1078,7.101,4.7756,2.639,3.5948,5.3028,1.554,5.9938,3.8824,0.925,4.0128,0.3404,2.3196,3.041,0.0074,0.5949,1.4204,1.8005,1.1944,3.6884,3.9482,0.3981,1.6607,0.5503,0.0392,0.7292,0.0236,0.0008,2.4034,2.014,0.8961,0.664,6.7544,0.0414,5.8176,0.1979,0.0027,4.9737,1.5685,1.8321,2.2162,1.4719,0.0823,6.5947,1.1349,6.9495,5.7747,0.5373,7.451,0.8406,7.5126,2.0996,6.2989,3.2605,0.6268,0.8333,6.3468,0.192,0.8198,0.9387,0.007,0.5467,0.6525,1.1742,2.0785,4.059,2.1984,0.7286,6.7214,0.2413,5.06,3.7774,5.8423,3.007,3.6172,1.9675,1.8283,2.8754,5.4126,4.9214,2.6507,7.6755,4.5077,5.3606,2.5149,4.4461,2.9255,4.6732,0.6773,1.2306,0.0084,0.0014,0.3597,4.3127,0.3383,4.0846,5.8717,0.7024,0.616,0.9373,2.7012,5.5612,3.909,0.4244,0.6795,2.426,0.034,1.3857,6.8536,1.8189,1.4773,3.4419,1.2937,2.5851,1.8835,4.3867,3.8426,1.1592,1.8265,4.4052,0.0016,2.2615,0.379]}
{"prompt":"Fighting in eastern Ukraine has escalated to the worst level in months , officials monitoring the conflict said on Tuesday , after the shelling of a frontline village wounded eight civilians and destroyed or damaged","text":"Fighting in eastern Ukraine has escalated to the worst level in months, officials monitoring the conflict said on Tuesday, after the shelling of a frontline village wounded eight civilians and destroyed or damaged a dozen homes.\nHospitals in the town of Slavyansk have been bombarded more than 150 times, and at least 44 people hurt, including seven critically, the OSCE said.\nNearly 40 per cent of the homes in the village of Bakhchysaraiin eastern Ukraine have been damaged, said the OSCE, and almost all of those hit by shrapnel or rockets have been demolished.\nMore than 500 shells had landed on the outskirts of the town on Monday, officials said, while in the centre the shelling was continuous, adding that some had fallen in open areas. The shelling in Slavyansk has already hit many people, the UN human rights office said.\nThe violence began almost two years ago when Russian-backed separatists launched an anti-government uprising against the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine.\nSince then, more than 10,000 people have been killed, and almost 5.5 million people displaced. In February, activists in the conflict zone, including in Slavyansk, called a unofficial referendum on Russia-backed separatist autonomy for eastern Ukraine that they said counted millions of support.\nNavalny has been jailed on return from Germany in what Moscow says is an attempt to keep him from running in parliamentary elections due in August. The Russian intelligence services claimed Navalny had been exposed to Novichok at a nerve agent gas attack.\nThe Kremlin denied involvement, but Navalny says he suffered the poisoning on a plane in August after being stung by a deadly poisonous jellyfish.\nAt a court hearing, Navalny\u2019s lawyer said he fears he risks being poisoned, in jail or murdered. At a court hearing by a Moscow regional court, his lawyer asked for prosecutors to seek his arrest for alleged involvement in murder in connection with the poisoning of Navalny.\nRussia rejects his poisoning and accuses Western countries of instigating a smear campaign against him. Speaking at the hearing, Navalny said on Tuesday that he had been stung at two places and that after the first sting he vomited a number of times.\nThe lawyer said he had received reports that the patient\u2019s wounds on the upper arm could be the result of poisoning. The lawyer said the patient has suffered a range of symptoms including vomiting.

A federal government shutdown is expected to cost the U.S. $6.25 billion in income tax revenue, but it is likely that the federal government will still not draw on the nation\u2019s largest savings account, the federal money market fund, and will use Treasury Department funds instead, according to The Washington Post.\nFauci\u2019s comments come as another potential source of tension was emerging between Democrats and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Thursday after a White House official told the CDC it would be hard to meet a requirement to test everyone in a coronavirus outbreak within 24 hours.\n\u201cAll of this is in the public domain,\u201d Wray said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the public domain, so I can\u2019t comment there. I\u2019m going to defer that to HHS. I\u2019m going to defer it to CDC.\u201d\n\u201cThere is the possibility that the U.S. might need to impose a travel quarantine that would limit the ability to travel across the U.S.,\u201d Fauci had said.\nWray added, however, the two countries also \u201cdo share the goals of minimizing the spread of the disease, trying to prevent it from further spreading to the U.S.\u201d\nAfter the recent surge in cases on the southern peninsula, U.S. officials have been trying to work with South Korea to restrict travel to and from the country. South Korea has announced a nationwide emergency that has halted passenger traffic and required citizens to wear masks.\nWray said the U.S. has been working with both countries to help them implement prevention measures. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with the U.N. on that issue as well,\u201d she said.\nWray did acknowledge that any restrictions may mean the U.S. will have an increased risk of spreading COVID-19 to other countries. That, however, seems to be an acceptable risk the Trump administration is willing to take.\nStill, the situation is not going to get any easier going forward. It is not only the U.S. but other countries around the globe which are battling the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt has the added concern of people\u2019s disregard for social distancing and the use of facemasks, as well as the uncertainty of the timing of the vaccine.\nAsked whether he was comfortable with the possibility that he didn\u2019t know how long the vaccine took to get FDA approval, Wray

The next 30 minutes were a case of survival, said the woman.\nI\u2019m surprised that I have not been jailed \u2014 I did not think the police would be so brutal at what I did, she said during her sentencing hearing.\nIn an open letter published today the four mothers call for the Government to recognise that the victims were not merely victims of the terrorist attacks of 21 March. The letter states:\nAs mothers whose children we have lost the night of 17 February, we share a deep sense of loss, grief, shock and betrayal, not only for the lives taken by those men [\u2026], but also our own children and our families.\nOur children are our light, our joy and our reason to live. However, in our darkest hour, we too were the victims, and no words can fully express the agony that we feel. We are also shocked and saddened by the failure of the public services to provide an adequate and proactive approach to our children.\nThe four parents say a police intervention that turned on its head what had been a routine morning teaching break was the turning point in their experiences that morning.\nIt\u2019s easy to see there was no chance for them to escape. The police would have been watching the school and we would have been completely surrounded. We looked at each other and asked, \u2018What now? We can\u2019t escape.\u2019\nThe women describe the scene as \u201can uncontrollable flood of emotions and feelings\u201d. It is hard to imagine what they might have done next \u2014 perhaps something akin to what I did or another of the women wrote in her letter: calling for help by way of 911 to put down the man.\nI\u2019ve been a mom all my life and I have no doubt that our experience of trauma would be no less profound than that, wrote one of the mothers, who described a state of \u201cpanic\u201d.\nIt is a dark, tragic and painful time in our history, but we must not lose sight of the overwhelming good that the British people demonstrated last week, and in their support for each other and their faith.\nOne of the men that we lost was a Muslim, and the four mothers say they felt a connection to him and all of the victims in their deepest sorrow and sadness for our lost family and loved ones in all directions.\nI know I felt it. I have been to all seven funerals, which is how many were held at St Martin-in-the-Fields.\nThe other three mothers said they would remember what happened next \u2014 and what the rest of the world saw on that fateful day that turned their lives upside down.\nI remember looking at the little girls in the play area \u2014 it seemed to take my breath away, recalled another mother.","token_len":637,"entropy":[9.0392,3.1615,7.6644,0.7632,1.6027,0.3909,9.1481,2.5876,2.4201,7.3961,0.2096,2.2673,3.3777,8.5066,0.7617,1.124,4.0116,5.5863,3.4271,2.6033,0.001,0.5653,2.9174,0.2291,9.5623,6.3492,1.2475,5.1043,2.437,2.1574,3.7503,3.1181,0.8534,1.7909,2.1384,0.0313,0.4355,15.0007,5.4982,4.6386,3.93,1.5655,1.6498,0.1359,3.3078,2.4066,1.1116,3.6644,1.5222,4.021,5.9595,2.3871,2.4111,2.2195,0.2597,12.0064,1.7083,6.34,9.679,0.6433,1.6451,0.3614,4.3552,6.5821,3.3419,2.9935,2.6333,3.4085,4.8979,7.7308,0.89,1.0106,3.0352,7.972,0.0695,7.0695,2.3066,5.5617,1.861,2.0728,2.1904,0.3696,3.246,16.0953,7.0097,1.8878,7.0275,2.5089,1.6469,3.8394,2.6941,1.0963,3.3234,5.4836,3.684,4.488,0.5777,2.0072,3.2856,2.2147,0.42,2.7263,2.5095,5.9035,4.7618,4.7791,1.1454,1.2002,2.8094,5.2172,0.484,8.1009,1.7215,1.2364,1.7716,1.0422,0.4518,4.1383,3.6582,4.8171,0.4593,3.416,4.1157,3.8673,7.1498,5.1902,7.8687,0.856,1.2644,3.6031,0.1013,5.929,2.0361,2.2029,5.2553,3.6457,1.9077,5.1009,2.6638,0.4798,2.7292,5.1261,0.9765,2.3255,7.763,3.3246,2.0991,2.8717,3.8059,3.4201,0.828,2.0852,5.0027,4.8653,6.1683,0.4809,7.9737,1.9353,1.0818,6.1211,6.86,5.126,4.3459,3.7184,0.7866,0.7235,5.0669,2.9279,1.5338,1.7099,0.0485,1.5813,1.9373,3.804,1.819,4.8709,0.3276,5.7045,2.4617,4.7135,1.259,1.7705,1.1728,4.2829,5.8817,1.8548,1.6533,7.4851,7.382,9.125,0.9143,0.0643,0.7733,3.2165,1.9748,3.4671,2.6483,1.8212,2.7161,0.4796,0.8126,5.4836,1.5598,1.6765,1.9025,7.9917,1.0522,0.392,4.5999,1.2884,0.173,7.3394,3.4475,1.333,0.3186,6.0502,0.3103,3.7265,2.6034,2.3793,1.2332,0.7549,0.8714,5.8675,3.3018,3.9455,0.3795,2.7691,1.371,5.2459,6.0231,0.5947,3.7458,0.7923,1.2613,4.1364,2.1593,1.1936,1.3815,0.9234,2.2131,1.7104,4.375,5.706,2.1837,1.8811,0.9894,0.3864,5.3452,0.3035,0.6586,4.8721,2.6315,0.6191,3.0915,4.4729,1.1343,2.0614,7.8088,3.6583,0.2534,3.9846,0.9064,1.0774,0.569,1.4117,3.4553,4.2487,3.1275,5.0681,4.0094,5.1781,4.283,5.512,3.2278,6.3054,0.9381,8.3817,2.4779,1.1549,0.8538,2.8329,5.1832,11.5131,6.3191,2.2691,3.5009,5.8244,0.015,1.4174,0.6132,7.3941,5.4815,4.2649,0.3021,0.5411,4.1335,12.7668,0.1064,1.3188,5.3968,0.1835,2.106,6.7065,1.1352,1.7178,5.6969,2.4214,2.4142,0.1594,2.4022,1.8275,2.1826,2.8617,4.2349,0.7477,2.0114,5.7347,2.5123,4.9255,1.9785,5.9486,0.7121,0.2449,1.1421,6.8848,4.8663,1.4593,2.3949,6.642,1.7667,0.6393,0.0265,1.3926,4.1355,2.1544,7.873,7.5437,3.8181,5.7159,0.3458,3.7603,3.8899,4.6496,1.6161,0.0238,3.1395,1.3074,4.2111,1.0108,0.8101,1.6234,4.0912,4.7248,1.7354,5.7182,1.2786,8.0613,4.0534,4.3754,7.0044,0.0077,6.875,0.3833,3.8033,1.5472,3.8745,3.491,6.5275,3.7259,3.4079,1.8256,3.1312,0.2378,1.5597,1.6912,2.3766,4.2861,0.3473,2.3838,5.0904,5.7341,5.138,5.7343,5.1809,0.0033,2.9395,3.9522,1.1409,4.4103,5.781,4.278,1.4379,3.5051,5.6953,1.2605,5.0703,0.5651,3.369,9.1002,1.6996,2.1738,6.8591,6.1766,0.0005,6.3384,4.6113,5.5252,5.1225,0.922,4.2801,1.356,0.5239,3.3852,2.6776,0.05,6.9197,1.5802,3.0416,6.2088,4.3548,0.0402,0.0292,1.6062,1.1036,1.7654,3.7525,2.0614,0.8262,4.1693,5.688,2.1008,6.1417,4.049,2.6357,5.7306,4.0662,4.0111,2.1321,1.6212,5.5392,7.9898,2.328,0.7347,0.1268,0.4619,1.6019,2.4518,3.5544,3.5874,5.6717,0.0936,9.8763,1.2728,3.7093,1.2339,0.916,1.3611,0.6592,3.1206,1.1737,2.894,6.0057,2.7467,4.5019,1.596,3.681,1.2501,2.3458,0.5399,4.6805,1.6513,2.5731,1.7911,2.2891,2.0017,3.5503,0.3365,0.0246,0.9116,6.1199,6.2402,0.819,3.6143,3.0717,0.8124,7.2975,4.3821,1.7458,2.1451,1.9349,4.0866,2.6644,3.58,2.1862,5.7739,0.3175,1.4996,1.7235,5.9253,0.8234,0.878,5.0371,0.8196,0.2701,4.6207,5.087,2.6429,2.3752,1.476,1.3085,2.5808,2.3482,1.7435,2.6166,5.2627,1.2178,2.9462,1.6057,2.9688,3.0527,5.1807,0.8863,0.7617,2.413,5.2302,1.6305,1.4626,3.1103,3.1443,1.6854,7.9338,4.4442,2.7642,3.8554,4.5294,3.3529,3.7215,2.7617,1.6707,2.8301,0.0502,5.2143,5.1856,7.1923,0.1472,0.4677,3.0169,3.7738,2.9469,5.9195,3.5932,2.2156,0.906,3.2455,1.6197,4.2416,4.1356,5.9731,4.1236,0.001,2.2076,5.4301,3.5168,3.2645,1.9021,4.9909,2.8735,2.7342,4.0994,5.1619,7.7489,2.4406,0.0564,0.3508,0.0193,0.7265,3.435,1.6557,1.6566,2.1805,4.3768,2.1194,1.4282,3.3223,0.7805,3.9265,6.7171,3.1493,2.3065,1.5154,3.8214,2.5954,2.6715,2.9001,5.7621,0.0376,1.27,1.4021,3.4808,3.549,2.6698,2.3618,0.5166,5.0241,5.8557,3.327,0.3489,2.2038,0.0486,0.2417,0.359,2.1422,3.9487,5.1905,0.9957,0.9596,5.12,2.7994,2.2465,0.7567,7.2132,2.9976,4.3295,4.4408,3.5876,1.8034,5.4484,5.7333,0.2213,0.0013,2.3665,9.162,5.0875,0.5572,1.0769]}

At the panel\u2019s weekly meeting Monday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who chairs oversight committee\u2019s Intelligence Subcommittee, urged Democratic committee staff to take a \u201cheated debate with Republicans seriously\u201d so investigations remain fair. \u201cIt\u2019s not time for political maneuvering,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cThe way the GOP is behaving today is not how a Congressman wants to behave.\u201d In an increasingly contentious 2016 election year, Cummings has criticized the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian interference, saying he believes Russian government operatives masquerading as journalists and bloggers have worked to sow chaos and divisiveness. \u201cEvery Congressman, including me, has a duty to protect this country,\u201d Representative Chris Smith (R) responded on the House floor, adding that he hopes the inquiry he authored into Russian interference in the election that led to Trump\u2019s victory will not be blocked by the GOP. The Democratic panel has begun an investigation into the alleged meddling in the 2016 election because of a complaint from a national security expert who was one of Trump\u2019s top campaign advisors, Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani is an experienced investigative reporter for The New York Times. He has played a pivotal role in the Trump campaign and now its governing coalition. Giuliani\u2019s complaint is not yet classified as damaging to the administration. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) have also accused the intelligence community of conducting a poor investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 election. But a top Intelligence Committee staffer says they have done their own investigation, and it appears the agency\u2019s findings were thorough and objective. But Rep. Mike Doyle (R-PA) says his committee will \u201cnever be able to conduct a credible investigation into any possible interference.\u201d Democratic and Republican leaders have not offered any reason for their differences. Congress is also debating several new intelligence reports on Russian interference. The FBI has said it does not yet believe significant Russian interference occurred in the 2018 general election, including allegations that Moscow meddled with the Democratic Party at the state level. The U.S. intelligence community did not provide any formal summary of its findings at a House meeting Tuesday, but Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) suggested the panel would likely issue a report later this year. His comments also reflected concerns that the intelligence community is trying to shield the intelligence community from political pressure. The House intelligence committee has not issued its own report on Russia since 2016. A bipartisan group of lawmakers last year requested an independent examination of intelligence claims that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election. But that effort failed in the Senate. The Senate intelligence committee released its report a few weeks ago.

{"prompt":"Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that the United States could no longer be a mediator in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict after its decision to recognize Israel as the capital of Israel","text":"Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that the United States could no longer be a mediator in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict after its decision to recognize Israel as the capital of Israel. \"The U.S. cannot mediate a conflict in which it itself does not play an important role,\" Erdogan told H\u00fcrriyet. He said that the decision was not an historic act; it was a step that would result in the loss of some American aid to the Palestinians. He also urged the Trump administration to reverse the declaration, saying, \"They've already given us an inch before they took three. What are we supposed to do now?\"\nThe Trump administration declared Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Friday, reversing a decision from then President Obama that upheld the status quo by keeping Jerusalem as a disputed city under divided supervision.\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. move \"has never been a conflict resolution. It is only the second step toward war in the region.\"\nErdogan also accused Netanyahu of \"playing with fire.\" Erdogan made his comments just days after Turkey had imposed a visa requirement on Israelis for security concerns in both countries but said further steps could follow.\nErdogan also expressed concern over Israel's construction of settlements on Palestinian land in the West Bank, which have resulted in further restrictions on residents. In the West Bank, Israelis live in separate cantons, each controlled by a local Palestinian authority, and Palestinians who work outside their canton also have to pass through an Israeli security barrier.\nThis weekend, thousands of Palestinians marched in protest of the Trump move and Jerusalem, including a major march in the West Bank city of Nablus. The demonstration, titled \"We Are Palestine\" by the protest group, included speeches in support of boycott and divestment. A large protest was also scheduled in Tel Aviv Saturday.\nA statement from the protest group, the Nonviolent BDS Network, said in Jerusalem, \"Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian people and the only capital that can lead to peace. In the meantime, the city remains illegally under Israeli occupation.\"\nIn a separate development, a former senior Turkish diplomat said Saturday that President Donald Trump has a long history of showing his personal agenda has overshadowed the role of the United States government in matters of international diplomacy.\nThe tweet from Hakan Kaya, a former minister whose son participated in the Trump presidential campaign, stated, \"The Trump administrations recent position is a long history that it has abandoned its obligation as a nation-state and it has shown its personal agenda which overshadows all decisions taken by the government.... the governments duty in international politics is to provide a balance to the interests of powerful people instead of focusing on their own personal agenda.\"\nA group of Turkish academics has written and submitted their papers in which they argue that the Trump administration s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital should not be

{"prompt":"A German court on Wednesday ordered the release of an army officer suspected of planning to carry out an attack on politicians and incriminate asylum seekers , saying there was not enough evidence to keep","text":"A German court on Wednesday ordered the release of an army officer suspected of planning to carry out an attack on politicians and incriminate asylum seekers, saying there was not enough evidence to keep him in custody.\nA source close to the inquiry said the court ordered the release of German army officer Christoph Gerstle, who was detained on Saturday, as there had been no solid evidence against him to be kept in custody.\nThe court said it had also ordered that Gerstle would be kept under close surveillance. \"These orders were aimed at putting an end to this situation. A person was detained for suspicion of planning a terrorist attack, then found not guilty of that suspicion in court, only to be released in a highly suspicious manner,\" the source said.\nThe court ordered that he would not be able to leave the country for at least a month after the order to be detained.\nThe investigation into the attempted assassination of politicians on May 19 is linked to the case of alleged sabotage against German President Barack Obama in Berlin in 2010.\nThe court said there was not enough evidence to keep Gerstle in custody, saying in a written order that there was a risk that he would use access to official facilities \"to further his unlawful terrorist agenda\". Gerstle, who also has been suspected in investigations into several other terrorism cases, was a soldier in the Bundeswehr's intelligence and investigation arm, the Investigations Squadron.\nHe was found in possession of two passports and had been carrying several small weapons, a court statement said. The court ordered the police that the suspect be kept under close surveillance.\nOn May 19, a bomb exploded almost six hours after an American political rally in Berlin, killing a policeman and injuring eight others, before detonating some time later in an empty street.\nNo one has been arrested and the bomb had no link to the campaign for the 2012 German elections, which saw Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrats win victory.\nIt is not clear whether the bomb was a hoax or an attempted assassination.\nGerman media reported earlier that a bomb had been sent to five politicians' residences, but police quickly ruled out that possibility. Police searched the offices of five suspects and located some of the explosives hidden inside a box.\nAuthorities did not know who sent the bomb. A day before the bombing, a Muslim convert, who had no criminal record, was captured in the centre of D\u00fcsseldorf, some 80km west of Berlin.\nIn October 2011, Gerstle had been released from prison on a promise to wear a tracker anklet to be able to trace him if he leaves the country, but a police investigation found no evidence the tracker had been removed and Gerstle had not returned the device.\nGerstle, 45, had served a prison sentence in Italy and in 2006 was sentenced to 10 years for membership in a terror group. He later pleaded guilty to a civil law crime and also provided false documents on his application for an Italian residency card.\nPosted 26 Jun 2012 26 Jun 2012 Wed 26 Jun 2012 at 3:31am, updated 26 Jun 2012 26 Jun 2012 Wed 26 Jun 2012 at 3:30am","token_len":639,"entropy":[9.3494,4.2764,2.4757,1.8266,1.8847,1.2135,3.0462,0.0189,3.4982,5.9946,1.6312,2.8631,0.0846,3.6019,1.0346,2.8383,0.0049,1.835,0.7198,0.357,8.9205,1.6583,13.1044,3.3693,7.279,0.1395,2.2913,2.6876,4.5465,0.5312,4.878,0.378,0.0715,0.2549,7.0207,1.1804,1.5997,0.9588,0.2166,0.1785,14.464,5.3477,0.656,0.002,0.4406,4.3314,0.8504,1.1912,2.8846,3.8502,0.9002,0.4503,0.1423,5.3286,2.8041,0.5674,5.7952,0.346,5.6605,2.8937,3.919,1.319,1.0354,1.2353,2.7483,1.6412,3.7513,2.5682,3.1703,6.1611,3.4297,0.2258,0.7941,7.8077,0.1264,3.1281,0.1202,3.9828,3.449,4.4146,0.4252,0.1743,0.3898,0.2703,1.565,2.3551,2.3483,2.1999,1.5483,3.4973,0.5155,1.8175,1.4017,0.0005,0.0005,3.6623,0.7023,3.8662,2.2171,5.1325,1.8576,2.2678,4.4626,5.0133,2.0199,2.4166,5.8374,0.0967,4.89,2.0475,0.0285,0.006,3.0941,4.0627,2.8895,4.7676,3.6045,5.0337,1.9754,2.1138,6.2242,0.121,1.6721,1.6305,0.5965,0.5105,2.2025,6.3803,5.8853,2.0393,0.5412,1.378,2.9891,8.2949,3.4054,1.6706,2.3529,5.5562,1.0202,0.4356,1.4684,2.7199,1.4453,7.3452,2.1527,1.0312,0.622,0.7555,1.4837,0.2885,0.0954,0.235,1.5356,2.1229,3.1275,1.1902,4.0276,2.5144,2.5398,0.435,4.6434,0.0097,2.3944,1.5019,0.2671,2.5025,3.0727,0.0014,2.4936,1.4832,2.895,1.6807,2.5002,3.8335,2.6436,5.6895,0.6982,0.738,1.5043,4.2951,0.853,0.614,5.3631,3.5235,0.3413,7.6559,3.7298,4.2435,3.4876,3.5055,6.7896,0.0388,1.2161,3.5008,0.1366,5.6381,7.2732,4.2471,2.2598,3.9118,5.3609,0.0108,2.1112,3.1737,2.1698,2.9267,0.4236,0.8306,1.5203,3.388,1.9729,3.2192,0.4724,2.328,0.2113,0.1112,0.2337,0.5543,0.3882,0.0007,0.0004,0.2575,0.1534,1.8118,2.4174,4.7407,0.7092,4.0604,2.8634,0.6399,1.8331,0.3885,3.407,4.4145,1.0189,1.0281,0.801,5.8091,10.5283,0.0999,4.9409,4.4724,3.8631,0.7627,3.1418,0.6524,5.877,5.8012,3.8258,0.883,3.9859,0.001,0.0024,2.3815,1.055,4.862,2.8674,3.4426,3.9859,3.4485,7.4196,0.4203,6.1804,1.0862,4.5083,1.1398,0.2801,1.1266,4.5012,4.6735,1.2789,0.1726,2.3132,0.3309,0.0002,1.2406,3.8963,2.5617,7.4433,4.3601,1.7652,0.8709,10.4261,11.1558,1.007,0.3888,2.3357,0.9629,4.5928,3.436,1.4574,0.0283,3.8369,4.4801,1.6392,3.2531,1.8061,4.6669,5.2495,4.7907,2.7687,1.321,3.2416,1.7544,2.5984,0.1316,0.0788,2.3437,0.9717,2.7823,2.099,4.9957,7.4282,3.2956,3.274,1.6876,2.0298,1.2549,0.8799,0.5265,0.9359,0.4867,3.94,2.4723,1.7322,0.2576,2.4514,4.2118,1.5002,9.0152,5.193,1.7246,0.1481,3.3208,4.5667,5.5848,1.6619,0.366,0.787,1.1964,0.2951,3.6287,3.2071,0.624,0.8332,4.128,0.6738,2.178,4.3577,2.9368,0.0022,7.8978,4.3895,0.2688,1.5309,3.0949,4.3579,3.2012,0.9607,0.9844,5.7359,1.7899,1.5953,0.1964,0.9436,2.5797,1.5988,3.9544,4.0371,2.5571,4.2937,0.1138,0.7062,5.0625,4.5686,1.1566,4.7401,2.5787,1.9027,1.3071,0.816,2.0461,1.2572,0.0295,0.0006,1.4924,3.1625,0.2105,1.8132,5.3186,0.798,0.712,5.08,1.2008,1.1949,1.0778,1.2904,1.021,3.1181,0.646,2.9303,3.6204,0.6128,1.9295,3.5425,1.7137,0.7286,1.3374,3.0286,2.295,1.256,3.4992,1.2594,2.3618,2.3599,1.2216,0.2247,5.3604,0.7472,8.197,5.5742,1.4415,2.219,2.2396,2.0113,3.3494,6.3822,2.9694,0.2449,1.5964,2.9141,0.3275,4.9675,5.1898,0.7852,2.9063,0.2764,4.3747,5.6974,1.8509,5.9433,4.6853,1.7085,1.0526,2.7115,4.9847,2.0503,1.866,4.0338,1.3845,0.709,4.6921,4.1033,0.0863,4.3553,2.3891,4.9056,0.0896,0.4666,2.3057,3.1842,6.288,2.0692,0.3643,3.173,0.1855,1.8225,7.1215,3.8234,2.9549,2.4749,1.5782,4.6061,3.1852,0.131,0.2621,0.9717,6.7084,1.6278,2.2028,6.7058,0.0377,6.6959,1.3598,0.0052,0.0001,0.0,0.0,1.3036,5.6367,3.669,1.6788,3.0616,0.0263,0.8827,0.5061,1.135,3.5069,4.354,3.541,0.1291,4.5564,0.0051,0.0014,3.545,0.9655,5.2086,0.7228,1.4827,2.2371,1.2956,2.9713,0.6565,6.2476,0.5212,9.0415,7.5873,0.0074,2.0661,4.6296,2.6134,0.001,4.8951,3.0812,5.3806,0.2941,7.5062,0.8598,0.0726,2.1861,1.3945,3.9781,3.1201,2.5338,1.2454,1.4461,0.8271,4.7032,4.7589,2.4458,0.4734,5.4099,3.3008,4.8139,0.001,0.0022,1.9526,1.5415,3.5334,4.0605,5.6662,0.7993,0.6412,3.4913,0.0015,0.0019,2.4931,5.2194,0.0153,1.8572,4.6265,2.4646,3.0127,0.2551,1.8142,6.0178,2.3432,4.5119,4.5916,1.1442,2.4233,0.0208,2.7224,0.0772,2.0695,6.1048,0.2204,0.8053,3.954,0.5811,0.742,1.3706,4.2152,2.8782,0.0797,0.2449,2.5938,7.218,4.762,4.0068,1.3844,6.0454,5.9327,3.8548,1.5609,4.5689,0.9813,2.2417,1.1589,4.2212,5.129,7.2172,4.3444,0.4737,0.9982,8.2356,9.9356,7.2402,1.2437,11.7039,7.486,0.0861,12.6904,4.5977,0.7404,0.0447,5.4983,3.9186,0.0474,4.3512,3.605,6.5027,5.8614,1.5385,0.3391,0.0275,4.2997,0.0186,0.0055,4.817,0.3531,0.0023,0.0035,0.232,1.1495,0.0005,2.5806,0.0141]}
{"prompt":"The FBI \u2019 S deputy director , Andrew McCabe , will appear for a closed-door interview on Thursday with two key U.S. congressional committees , after Republicans asked him to discuss the bureau \u2019 s","text":"The FBI \u2019 S deputy director, Andrew McCabe, will appear for a closed-door interview on Thursday with two key U.S. congressional committees, after Republicans asked him to discuss the bureau \u2019 s handling of the Russia \/ intelligence interference case. A source from one of the committees said the FBI lawyer told them he would testify before the Intelligence Committee, the committee investigating the Russia \/ Trump controversy.\nThe investigation has gone a long way \u2014 but it probably isn \u2019 t ready to declare a winner. And it could get more twisted still as McCabe and the prosecutors of Mueller \u2019 s probe work in concert to determine what kind of witnesses to bring in.\nThe two prosecutors are going to sit down at the same time with the same people, according to people familiar with the matter. If it sounds like a coincidence, it isn \u2019 t.\nOne of those prosecutors will have been the lead attorney for Mueller and McCabe, Mark Womack, who is also in charge of the special counsel \u2019 s investigation. Womack will sit with the senior investigators on Thursday, one of the people said.\nThe top lawyers for Trump have been aggressively fighting against McCabe and his investigators in recent weeks after some key people were asked to testify before Congress, according to several congressional committees and a government watchdog, including several senior members of the Trump administration.\nBut both congressional committees have said they wanted to have the interview with McCabe and to get answers about what happened as the FBI investigated Trump associates and former aides.\nThe first time McCabe resurfaced was Tuesday night when he was ordered to take depositions under oath from seven people who cooperated with the investigation and with former special counsel Robert Mueller.\nThe U.S. congressional committees requested those depositions, but didn \u2019 t specify who they were. The person familiar with the information said one of the people would have been a key Trump ally, according to the person.\nAfter that announcement, the White House had strong words for the congressional committees. In an effort to keep lawmakers under control, the White House called on the Committees to keep their questions to the individuals who have taken a deposition already, instead of asking about the events surrounding that deposition, the source said.\nSenior White House officials expressed concern that the committees might ask questions that the House Intelligence Committee has already asked the attorney general. After that, senators like Richard Burr asked the White House to intervene to protect some individuals\u2019 \u2014 like James Comey \u2014 anonymity, but Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions both publicly called on the congressional committees to follow the rules.\nThe last time McCabe sat in a Senate hearing appeared to have put off many senators. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday asked him not only questions under oath about the investigation, but told him he wasn \u2019 t to answer any more questions about anything outside the investigative process unless they had been requested by Congress, according to one source familiar with the meeting.\nWhen the top FBI official resurfaced Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee asked two questions to McCabe, one of them concerning the timing.

Financial Regulatory Agencies. Equifax has denied using personal information to black list people. The bank said it would investigate and close its accounts of anyone who breached the company\u2019s online safety procedures while signing up for the account. What is a white list and a black list?. What is a white list and a black list?\nThe first major U.S. consumer privacy attack in over a decade triggered a record number of Americans to cancel credit cards and other online accounts. The Equifax breach of consumer information affected more than 143 million people and companies. Equifax is investigating the breach that has been traced back to the U.S. data breach affecting 143 million people this month, which prompted people worldwide to blackout their identities and cancel credit cards.\nTwo key U.S. senators on Monday asked Equifax Inc ( EFX.N ) to answer detailed questions about a breach of information affecting up to 143 million Americans, including whether U.S. government agency records were inadvertently exposed in the breach. Equifax and three of its former chief officers have pleaded not guilty to wire frauds that led regulators to levy the heaviest fines in the history of financial services.\nThe latest update on the Equifax data breach, the largest breach in U.S. history, appears to have revealed the largest number of private credit card numbers and account numbers in the database \u2014 up to 150 million \u2014 according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Department of Justice documents. In the last step, the hackers used the compromised data to sign up for credit cards.\nIn some countries, governments use the blacklist to issue a new identification card at the local level. The information in the blacklist is used in some countries to register people for public utilities.\nEquifax data breach: FBI says law enforcement alerted Equifax of criminal threat. Published Friday, November 13, 2020 - 7:00 PM. The FBI was made aware of a malicious threat to Equifax, but not how the threat was linked to the breach of information about 143 million Americans.,, The FBI received a request to investigate a malicious threat to Equifax, the federal bureau said in a statement released Friday.\nOne of the main problems with this story is that its implications are much broader than the actual Equifax data breach. Equifax hasn\u2019t found out what they did to those 143 million persons whose data was exposed, but the implications of this data breach are far greater than, say, the release of tax records. In an incident of its own that has now reached the White House, Equifax suffered a data breach. Some personal data belonging to 143 millions of Americans was exposed online. The problem?

Have data breaches been the stuff of science fiction?","token_len":640,"entropy":[7.7151,8.076,0.073,0.0279,0.0373,3.6829,3.1825,2.6006,4.2071,11.2041,0.182,3.8214,5.2749,11.0131,6.4516,0.5196,0.2347,0.0543,0.4665,5.7508,6.8094,0.1183,0.3378,3.6027,2.8564,0.772,4.0894,6.7469,5.4129,0.0024,5.3193,0.2732,2.1465,1.5784,0.6558,5.7442,5.5516,0.0022,0.001,0.023,3.7305,6.4037,4.1929,1.3897,6.1042,3.5114,2.9404,0.7438,1.2295,0.299,0.3484,21.8297,0.0,4.0935,4.5771,1.4231,0.1778,3.6771,2.5747,8.3255,1.9964,2.6433,0.327,0.0007,0.6565,5.4553,0.0128,9.0661,2.9097,2.3467,7.4798,0.0885,6.6691,4.3474,5.1539,0.7446,1.1678,2.1548,1.3407,0.0048,4.1649,2.1912,1.0925,7.4237,9.1941,8.9504,0.0193,5.2931,7.5596,0.0,2.2312,3.9561,5.1325,5.8257,0.3335,1.6504,10.9213,4.4381,2.7138,2.1905,2.9801,4.7867,1.8543,0.9894,3.2328,4.8037,3.1591,5.7035,2.6915,2.2974,3.2442,3.4531,0.8693,2.8256,1.2994,1.7446,16.6955,6.9973,5.4439,5.0522,4.8658,4.9269,7.2607,8.8398,0.5953,0.3135,1.9455,6.533,0.4318,8.7511,2.3199,3.3564,8.0637,1.3195,3.3218,5.4616,1.0116,0.0185,0.3492,7.6248,3.9722,1.039,0.5974,2.0752,0.0456,0.5031,0.5026,0.0218,0.0012,0.1276,1.7936,2.476,5.0311,5.0771,2.9609,0.0004,0.0013,0.0051,5.426,2.3861,7.1761,2.3917,3.8957,0.6681,0.254,7.0419,1.5059,7.0203,2.7302,0.0047,6.0383,1.2546,4.7724,2.9701,1.3038,1.1343,1.9081,3.4852,3.1937,1.3517,1.7925,6.6328,0.0001,0.5464,3.9829,3.819,0.9874,3.4895,1.5607,0.0447,4.9856,0.0601,1.3831,2.5702,6.8286,2.3874,2.8617,0.0001,3.2137,5.3057,1.4874,0.7575,5.2526,4.1789,3.1466,4.8705,1.1063,0.0393,1.818,3.1102,0.0004,0.0037,0.1457,7.7243,1.4049,6.7857,4.9047,0.0707,1.5983,6.3332,2.0445,1.9603,4.0876,3.5744,6.2774,5.2009,0.0576,11.1383,1.0206,8.4652,1.5547,3.5162,2.681,0.3971,0.6494,0.9711,6.0395,2.875,0.2334,0.0002,0.0006,0.0003,0.0153,0.1754,0.0046,0.0234,0.012,0.0,0.0651,0.4119,0.0273,0.0004,0.0022,0.002,0.0089,0.001,0.0074,0.0187,0.0003,0.0022,0.0091,0.0025,0.0246,0.0222,0.0203,0.0018,0.0004,0.018,0.0033,0.0436,0.0223,0.0004,0.0392,0.0099,0.0004,0.0009,0.0003,0.0039,0.0249,0.0109,0.0064,0.0226,0.0005,0.0021,0.0008,0.0034,0.0332,2.7761,0.0,0.0981,0.0026,0.0004,0.0007,0.0002,0.0171,0.0781,0.0023,0.0097,0.0016,0.0006,0.0005,0.001,0.0003,0.0004,0.0022,0.0077,0.0028,0.0002,0.0095,0.001,0.0124,0.0029,0.0018,0.0017,0.0121,0.0004,0.0063,0.0103,0.0045,1.6649,1.5232,5.9024,5.2346,2.2527,0.7192,1.1688,0.0,4.3947,0.0256,3.0938,3.841,2.2253,3.4721,1.1119,0.6894,0.0003,0.0009,0.0014,0.2402,0.2922,5.8535,0.1479,1.2846,5.9505,2.0268,6.1406,1.5883,0.0097,6.291,4.1405,0.3977,2.4272,2.6521,4.3018,0.8668,1.9316,0.9745,4.599,5.5408,3.4896,1.0125,5.0927,0.1832,2.4792,4.1497,0.0021,1.773,4.3172,0.9262,0.7637,3.3432,0.0004,0.0017,0.0071,4.5776,0.0011,0.9283,2.3264,0.7987,4.1637,1.8898,3.1734,8.2305,1.6798,1.3838,5.1605,3.5583,1.8066,3.4383,1.8227,0.1825,6.2987,0.5091,0.4231,2.2746,1.3033,2.6481,0.8249,3.2885,4.8494,4.701,0.2304,6.0827,4.819,1.8767,8.7496,2.3647,7.1107,3.7731,4.2808,5.7029,2.0408,5.0478,1.0799,5.7077,1.878,1.2289,1.9229,4.8769,3.3688,0.44,2.3758,1.0154,1.8851,3.535,3.2973,1.6007,0.6811,4.8682,2.0987,1.7394,4.3865,6.3428,1.7125,1.2228,3.4213,0.0,6.929,0.7852,1.9882,6.0579,2.9664,6.5272,0.3648,6.8197,2.5699,0.0001,2.828,6.6876,5.3164,2.9269,8.9703,3.8689,0.781,4.0484,3.3753,0.222,10.7135,5.1069,3.1274,0.0491,2.8643,1.7575,3.4663,3.1999,1.0969,4.7175,6.0697,0.0029,0.211,1.336,5.7529,4.4039,1.3727,2.4049,0.0,3.3395,4.2541,3.667,6.0947,2.1699,2.2702,0.9217,6.1395,0.1558,0.605,1.6291,3.2211,2.5458,2.4342,0.677,0.0307,1.3294,7.3409,6.7502,3.3836,0.6293,6.7169,0.7095,2.6921,2.5446,2.0628,1.759,3.01,1.1458,0.3825,0.133,0.0,0.2665,4.5228,4.8477,4.0763,0.3623,1.1454,0.1421,0.2028,3.8622,0.8418,0.7506,1.0528,5.8858,0.6456,0.2116,3.717,3.1911,0.8682,3.3034,4.3558,0.6987,0.2872,5.689,6.9656,1.0315,4.5279,0.8286,0.4188,1.3544,5.1791,6.2162,0.0,1.0253,0.0918,0.6512,2.815,0.0001,6.8925,11.2556,2.3248,0.5364,6.3434,4.32,2.4556,5.11,2.8762,2.0063,5.4932,2.7648,0.0267,7.2423,4.8095,2.7147,0.5761,2.1936,1.6957,1.9607,1.777,7.1077,1.7793,2.3067,3.1022,0.093,0.894,1.7546,2.5173,0.5166,6.847,0.2047,0.1611,0.9456,7.7809,1.2168,7.8956,2.388,1.3414,3.5985,4.1168,6.4165,3.8193,5.5616,0.0781,4.1384,2.352,4.8871,3.9801,1.0265,3.7323,0.0008,0.2585,1.5981,0.0001,7.3369,0.8878,3.65,0.0871,4.2828,5.7031,7.6135,1.8334,4.518,0.0033,5.4311,6.4519,0.9172,0.6467,0.934,1.7821,4.893,1.5262,2.1454,5.4895,4.9183,5.25,4.9051,5.0329,4.8878,0.4859,1.4861,2.8729,0.7908,6.7877,3.9249,0.0871,0.7435,5.1029,6.4732,0.0156,4.1946,0.0195,0.594]}
{"prompt":"Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday , shortly before riot police teargassed the convoy of opposition leader Raila Odinga , who promised supporters he would be sworn in","text":"Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday, shortly before riot police teargassed the convoy of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who promised supporters he would be sworn in and return to power.\nPresidential spokesman James Matia told reporters that there had been disruptions by supporters of the now-elected opponent of Mr Kenyatta, who told reporters he had told police that he would not obey his orders and proceed for the ceremony.\nProtesters broke windows in the presidential motorcade and threw bricks, rocks and other objects at police, some of the demonstrators shouting slogans against Kenyatta. The demonstrators tried to climb over fences to reach the party headquarters where Mr Kenyatta was due to be sworn in, before being stopped by police. A large number of security personnel were on standby in the building to protect Mr Kenyatta. At first, riot police used tear gas and metal pipes to quell the protests on the outskirts of the headquarters.\nSome youths shouted at the police before some supporters of Odinga tried to climb the fence and head towards the presidential compound, but police fired in their direction and some were wounded. Mr Odinga had made a number of unsubstantiated threats that he would not be sworn in, a fact that he later disputed after it emerged that it would be done in his absence and only in case of emergency. Protesters also said the new president would be sworn in in full ceremonies, with no one present and a crowd of thousands would be allowed to watch. Mr Kenyatta, 73, was sworn in as Kenya's 14th president last month in a ceremony attended by heads of state and government from across the world.

{"prompt":"Like the deal-maker he says he is , U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be keeping his options open as his Republican Party threatens to erupt into full-scale war . On Monday , almost immediately","text":"Like the deal-maker he says he is, U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be keeping his options open as his Republican Party threatens to erupt into full-scale war. On Monday, almost immediately after he declared his victory, Trump said in a speech to a New York City crowd, I have got to get my ducks in a row, but I am open to any other deal. Then he went on to tout some potential trade deals, including with Brazil and Argentina, and said it would be in the best interest of the country to renegotiate the current NAFTA trade agreement, which he said was a dump. The administration was already attempting to negotiate a trade deal with Canada, but Ottawa and the Trump administration have recently taken a number of steps aimed at renegotiating the agreement, including a request that more be included in terms of environmental protections.\nNATO leaders are to meet in Brussels in an emergency meeting next week as Russia, Iran and North Korea threaten more chaos in the region. The meeting comes as NATO and its allies are under growing pressure over Russia's militarisation of its southern flank. The United States, Britain and other NATO allies are calling for Russia and its allies to take action to avoid military conflict with the Ukrainian military in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has been heavily deploying its weapons systems. The meeting is set to start Friday but is expected to end with more confrontation between Russia and the West.\nA group of more than 30 former CIA analysts and other whistleblowers have accused President Donald Trump of trying to subvert democracy the night before Democrats took control of the House of Representatives by unleashing a network of fake news and social media accounts that spread disinformation to undermine the election outcomes.\nIn a widely circulated tweet, President Donald Trump called the election a \"scoop\" and predicted that his opponent, the Democrat Joe Biden, will be sworn in as president \"before noon.\" A series of tweets at night were taken as proof that Trump was attempting to overturn the election. A spokesman for Twitter said it was suspending accounts that carried misleading information to get the US president re-elected.\nThe Associated Press and NBC News have reported that hundreds, possibly thousands, of false Twitter messages and Tweets have been removed after President Donald Trump claimed that the elections were hacked.\nTrump was referring to a conspiracy theory that the election was rigged due to an attack by cyber spies from Russia to sow chaos in Americans in 2020. Biden won 306 electoral votes, with Trump garnering 232. There was widespread speculation during the campaign that the Trump campaign may have attempted to sway the election in favour of its own candidate. Biden has refused to concede the victory, and Trump went on the campaign trail claiming without evidence that Joe Biden did not possess the physical signature to prove his identity. While Biden has so far not demanded a recount of the election, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney general in 2016, said that the president would have no problem disputing the results.\nThe Biden transition team and the White House have continued their own investigation into a possible Trump campaign'cyber breach. The White House told Fox News on Monday evening that it was investigating the hacking and has brought on investigators from FBI headquarters.","token_len":641,"entropy":[2.6271,8.76,4.5031,2.0841,5.209,5.3249,1.1715,3.1398,0.6504,5.9735,0.712,0.0447,0.0941,2.393,0.84,0.0085,4.9415,0.4494,0.763,5.3905,1.2531,4.3889,0.0598,3.1984,3.7973,5.6254,4.0206,6.7547,0.1849,7.7958,0.7541,4.5744,0.2894,1.1239,3.5041,1.152,4.822,2.0636,0.3285,8.8014,2.0493,0.1941,2.9588,4.2183,1.8193,4.3692,1.0735,0.5953,2.8021,3.5442,0.691,2.5735,2.0755,1.739,5.4529,0.825,2.4341,3.872,2.5745,8.9717,3.7383,5.3156,0.9577,2.3463,3.768,6.257,0.0315,0.0087,0.0003,2.0552,4.2447,1.077,3.1099,6.0625,0.2097,3.3987,4.3909,4.4721,1.0869,6.7923,1.3289,2.4387,0.3341,0.5179,6.4633,0.0437,4.6248,5.6961,2.7566,0.2167,1.5813,1.5291,2.6418,5.6089,1.8184,6.2353,0.8684,1.4216,2.1566,3.9955,1.4156,0.5402,5.7468,0.8208,1.8437,0.2824,0.0146,0.7296,3.3477,0.686,3.0327,0.0003,1.8437,6.8068,3.7621,3.137,1.773,2.2911,0.9258,1.2859,0.8555,1.9341,2.5536,10.7344,1.8491,3.3569,5.437,3.8451,4.0934,5.5311,0.0715,2.923,0.9087,2.4707,0.3983,0.2571,2.0564,1.0122,1.2457,8.8404,3.8394,1.4965,3.1515,0.1677,1.5597,6.4904,4.2073,1.3583,6.0141,0.0108,0.5855,6.3411,0.0226,3.8088,0.0018,0.8943,2.1784,1.4083,0.7967,2.067,4.5126,2.2427,7.318,8.56,4.2661,0.1569,7.9507,0.0717,6.7155,1.6797,0.8068,1.4273,18.5607,0.0053,4.3733,2.1385,5.9404,0.7705,1.1603,1.0923,2.8043,3.9565,4.9937,0.94,2.6613,0.2897,4.8549,5.1104,2.5019,2.8189,0.5858,2.4242,0.0068,4.2109,5.8747,7.369,1.2771,0.5056,0.335,0.435,2.1372,2.468,2.3269,1.3972,2.4534,3.302,1.7688,0.9301,1.4411,4.0346,3.0545,0.0716,3.5037,1.5479,0.0918,8.2307,3.8873,0.2943,1.3957,4.8988,4.0649,0.9735,2.347,2.9693,0.0677,2.2157,2.5863,0.4626,2.4472,1.3376,1.3298,0.8623,5.545,0.499,3.3407,3.0483,2.4897,0.5595,0.1119,3.2316,3.004,1.0263,4.3983,4.4185,1.199,2.0972,1.1957,6.0193,3.0533,3.8958,1.5964,0.0334,1.8421,1.9741,2.2907,1.0428,1.6019,6.6497,6.719,1.8976,6.4693,3.7777,0.5013,2.3294,3.0002,1.4877,3.1957,0.5988,3.3387,5.2164,4.6615,2.1593,1.3753,0.0059,3.4767,1.8197,4.7096,7.8629,1.6285,1.3542,0.0529,0.7877,1.1844,0.3738,1.1401,6.3913,5.0198,0.0445,5.1263,0.0059,2.9405,3.8922,4.5487,3.1895,2.0411,3.7234,6.5869,2.0763,3.1882,3.9467,2.4107,0.0071,0.2251,3.531,0.0158,5.9486,0.0106,3.4022,8.475,7.9941,0.1487,9.7616,2.3196,0.5496,0.0591,0.5601,1.4534,0.6343,0.0162,4.3622,7.38,0.0001,0.6574,9.2617,0.0107,3.9326,0.2245,3.0687,4.4915,0.0828,2.8582,2.3912,2.6935,2.6005,3.2787,2.8603,1.1037,2.9343,6.0041,0.5504,1.7562,3.3559,1.3313,5.8387,1.8581,2.6479,1.1058,4.7041,1.2077,0.0225,2.8991,1.6602,3.9486,3.6014,0.3901,7.4457,5.7421,0.1971,0.9231,0.6538,5.4173,1.084,3.3742,3.7876,1.5276,7.4875,1.5128,9.3215,0.3686,0.0751,3.3093,1.3972,5.608,0.0597,0.9001,1.4243,3.6253,5.2859,6.3496,1.6514,3.8769,4.3784,0.0019,1.372,6.1278,4.7137,3.691,4.7533,3.174,1.7966,1.119,1.3251,1.0551,4.0258,0.0407,7.283,0.8847,0.8196,2.8995,3.5657,4.8256,0.0652,7.6671,1.1892,2.8238,1.2832,4.9581,2.3674,1.7262,5.2991,5.916,2.1891,3.7514,5.7676,2.2739,6.2303,3.1117,8.3326,0.1327,0.0187,0.3806,1.2056,2.0841,5.0824,0.0021,3.9093,4.085,0.2484,2.0523,0.8646,0.495,6.0089,5.309,1.6728,0.1679,0.4259,0.0758,6.3594,5.1013,2.6895,2.4676,7.1366,0.0124,2.2272,0.1759,4.8113,4.2235,4.0145,0.5847,0.007,4.0803,1.6708,1.8366,5.2501,0.3059,4.7687,1.1836,1.668,2.7131,3.4826,4.3477,0.0286,1.5909,5.0913,0.1462,0.876,1.816,1.1584,0.3703,1.946,6.5201,0.0233,4.1617,6.1442,1.101,5.8477,6.0537,2.8457,0.5843,3.5797,4.9442,1.9053,0.5361,10.1317,5.3815,8.6733,0.3294,9.8697,5.9784,6.7591,0.3331,0.029,1.738,3.0653,2.3042,5.8041,0.0025,4.3607,1.0487,5.5188,1.9751,3.8362,1.6181,4.8001,0.1498,0.9241,0.1631,1.4341,4.7426,0.3036,3.6839,0.1196,4.5912,0.055,3.3019,0.3547,0.6655,2.2359,3.0922,0.0053,6.3321,2.1125,0.244,0.7939,5.7951,2.539,4.526,0.0489,2.8654,1.5542,6.132,1.6748,1.7287,2.2251,6.5686,0.4239,3.9133,4.5365,0.6774,4.0201,8.5815,1.0067,0.2243,8.1032,0.0165,4.582,1.1242,7.9747,0.5664,5.4933,6.9065,2.1102,6.2112,1.36,4.1404,0.3014,5.5067,2.8963,1.5309,7.0729,0.0076,2.7674,8.4083,2.2002,0.3183,1.5835,0.5745,1.8412,1.2509,12.2661,0.0052,0.8083,3.1278,0.0213,5.5007,0.2154,4.2355,3.5957,0.1285,1.7253,1.8512,1.6939,2.8991,2.8311,2.9408,3.619,1.1468,7.9076,0.1178,0.8492,1.9949,1.6249,0.8504,2.0415,10.5608,6.5213,0.2341,4.3413,1.5129,1.4392,0.0005,1.2743,5.9249,3.4109,4.0817,2.6888,0.4459,5.1997,2.5236,4.2895,1.4139,11.4722,13.4995,0.2565,6.522,1.1991,1.5951,2.4594,0.0013,4.6472,3.7983,0.1132,1.3452,1.16,3.8791,0.1119,1.4908,1.6135,2.1079,1.5036,3.2147,2.0436,3.6954,6.9522,4.5798,4.1242,0.9255,5.2889,4.4871,1.1395]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump spoke to U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama on Monday and endorsed his campaign , the White House said . \u201c The president had a positive call with Judge Roy Moore","text":"President Donald Trump spoke to U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama on Monday and endorsed his campaign, the White House said. \u201c The president had a positive call with Judge Roy Moore, a longtime friend, this morning,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.. Mr Trump\u2019s comments came days after the Supreme Court invalidated Mr Trump\u2019s removal of Judge Brett Kavanaugh from the federal bench. \u201cThe president was able to support Judge Moore, who has a long and distinguished career in public life, and the longstanding tradition of the courts of appointees who have served as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Grisham\u2026\nSugarbeet producers in Texas are facing a significant shortage of sugarbeet because of high costs to import this crop from abroad. The Sugarbeet Export Council, a group of South Texan sugarbeet producers, announced it had negotiated on a three-month supply of sugarbeet imported from Europe, and now they are ready to ship it. In addition, Florida Sugar Co., which sources sugarbeets from Louisiana and is shipping into Texas, is also ready to ship a small amount. They have a small amount of fresh sugarbeets, plus a few containers. We have a smaller amount that could be shipped now too, if we get the permission to do so,\u201d said Rick McDonnell, the president of the Sugarbeet Export Council\u2026\nPresident Donald Trump praised Judge Brett Kavanaugh Thursday for his role in overturning the 1973 criminal abortion law of Roe v. Wade that once allowed virtually any abortion for any reason. Speaking at a national antiabortion rally at a university in Miami-Dade, Florida, Trump said Kavanaugh\u2019s decisions were \u201cvery, very good.\u201d \u201cThe other decisions you\u2019ve seen him make were very, very good,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s a tremendous judge, and I hope he\u2019s confirmed,\u201d Trump continued. Kavanaugh took the stand at the opening argument Wednesday in his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. The Supreme Court\u2019s nominee, confirmed by a narrow majority, faced harsh scrutiny as a legal abortion activist and opponent of Planned Parenthood\u2026\nPresident Trump took a firm stand on Thursday in defending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v.

{"prompt":"North Korea \u2019 s nuclear threat looms large this week over the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York , where diplomats are eager to hear U.S. President Donald Trump","text":"North Korea \u2019 s nuclear threat looms large this week over the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York, where diplomats are eager to hear U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest moves to try to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Trump has made no public commitments to North Korean denuclearization, but the president has asked United Nations Security Council members for help persuading Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear and missile programs instead of advancing toward nuclear weapons. If the U.S. and five other nuclear-armed states do not act with North Korea, the administration says, North Korea will likely launch a nuclear strike on the United States \u201d in retaliation. \u201d It\u2019s a threat that Pyongyang has repeatedly repeated in recent years. Trump tweeted the day after he took office \u201d North Korea is an impoverished, hostile country that has the smallest economy in the world, lives under relentless United Nations sanctions, and continues to threaten nuclear \u2026 read more\nThe US President is making no secret of his plans to fire the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, because of what he called his disastrous judgment on a recent leak of highly classified intelligence, which revealed Obama\u2019s alleged plan to invade Syria. The President is making no secret of his plans to fire the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, because of what he called his disastrous judgment on a recent leak of highly classified intelligence, which revealed that the Obama administration had been planning to invade and occupy Syria without the knowledge of Congress, which has no such authority. But there is an alternative path to Washington\u2019s endgame for the Assad government in Syria: military action taken alongside NATO to contain the Syrian rebellion, leaving Assad intact for further use and the creation of a Syrian-Arab dictatorship that will be supported by Washington. What this means is that Obama does not want to end the war and he did not need any assistance from Washington, including that of any intelligence agency, in order to accomplish that objective. The only reason that Obama was able to accomplish what he wanted to accomplish was because the Assad regime had reached the point where it was a threat to regional stability in addition to a terrorist threat, and as such it could withstand military action while avoiding further political collapse. As such, the choice in Syria between military action against civilians from the government of Bashar al-Assad or military action against the forces of the Syrian rebels is not an issue of whether to target the regime or leave it intact in order to support the creation of a new dictator, but an issue of timing and method, which will be determined by how long it takes for Assad to collapse and the military to move in with military allies to replace it. What Obama apparently did not understand \u2014 while he may have known \u2014 is that military action against the Syrian government would not be allowed because the military needs to stay clear of Syrian borders, and there would not be a military ally in the region to take up the position. While Washington\u2019s military is involved in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Arabian Sea, they do little more than patrols and anti-terrorist operations. The Syrian situation is a very different matter, and this brings \u2026 read more","token_len":642,"entropy":[8.278,13.149,8.9513,7.5287,7.7349,3.4921,8.8281,4.2285,6.5179,0.711,4.8472,1.9433,7.2685,4.0487,0.1196,1.7863,0.1128,3.1364,0.3986,0.931,0.0066,2.4144,0.0869,0.0014,1.6961,1.0304,6.7398,2.2023,6.4957,0.0503,4.431,5.4467,0.0007,0.2516,0.0778,1.573,0.3354,0.0072,12.5082,3.0997,1.2214,4.7765,5.0938,1.4672,4.9197,0.3102,4.1639,1.2123,0.0417,0.0957,4.2139,0.0568,0.2096,0.1828,0.6957,0.8416,3.9259,1.5307,3.5039,2.5323,2.5404,4.3905,0.4929,3.8131,3.8364,3.4525,0.0065,0.0569,0.9756,1.2006,2.7128,3.7424,1.1674,5.6195,7.2857,0.0791,0.7692,0.0014,1.7977,3.6146,2.5398,7.496,0.0001,1.2806,0.1082,6.5942,0.2475,0.4038,3.1742,0.3211,0.3432,7.7382,1.3683,6.0451,5.5523,3.7355,0.6625,0.3497,5.3734,1.5463,1.6269,0.0005,0.502,0.0704,1.9302,7.6881,0.3346,5.3303,0.8415,0.1983,1.9743,2.6332,0.4731,3.3314,5.598,3.0316,0.0633,2.0156,1.3275,5.9267,1.6443,0.4442,2.4899,0.0492,1.9111,3.8642,4.1744,0.8405,2.3323,2.5641,0.9901,0.5758,0.6839,0.0192,8.3237,8.0588,3.8539,1.4045,1.0019,4.9847,3.7819,4.2649,6.2283,2.4694,0.072,2.5129,3.7998,1.1294,4.6733,1.9234,2.7814,5.4844,2.4054,1.4336,2.2569,0.8774,3.9578,5.827,4.1352,2.599,0.9069,3.4232,2.9726,0.0697,4.9907,0.8489,8.5825,0.0902,3.0826,5.2218,9.5587,2.0465,5.7603,1.2797,1.1428,1.6574,4.2688,6.4098,2.4391,0.657,0.0582,0.1022,1.3742,7.3627,3.1039,6.0185,9.5805,0.104,0.0625,0.7286,0.3744,4.7084,0.0742,2.8591,3.491,13.8774,8.2952,0.0514,1.2066,10.9686,4.5744,4.8113,2.7193,4.4037,3.3644,1.1622,0.2197,0.2585,4.6509,0.1909,6.6157,2.6894,4.7946,0.0311,0.1387,0.0002,1.3102,0.2524,0.0524,0.421,5.0215,1.9004,3.9718,0.343,2.7269,1.6897,9.6345,5.8959,1.5328,3.645,2.9279,5.7777,0.9292,3.2601,0.068,2.0328,3.6433,2.2109,3.0991,6.7549,7.883,0.3905,0.0335,5.1915,5.0293,0.1632,3.8657,2.6436,1.2559,2.0448,2.7928,1.8743,2.6035,0.0377,0.0111,0.0074,0.0041,0.0012,0.0023,0.0028,0.0115,0.0059,0.0003,0.0078,0.0019,0.0102,0.0012,0.0025,0.0034,0.002,0.0014,0.0017,0.002,0.0087,0.0032,0.001,0.0187,0.0021,0.0025,0.0041,0.003,0.0009,0.0034,0.0014,0.0162,0.0009,0.0001,0.0035,8.5799,7.2812,0.8202,0.4505,1.7591,2.6557,4.3669,0.4635,1.1981,4.2401,2.8357,1.4255,4.1977,2.7342,3.8463,0.2715,1.3586,2.4604,3.0822,3.1406,4.3839,3.7203,2.5083,0.3584,4.1781,3.7524,0.8191,3.478,4.7315,5.7024,1.3887,4.3724,1.3066,0.4842,0.3987,6.759,4.817,4.937,1.8369,6.4726,3.5009,3.4854,0.345,2.3962,5.6115,1.2052,7.696,7.2225,4.4557,3.6613,5.0744,0.9576,2.8649,3.7923,2.1165,7.0837,1.7577,6.1176,4.0332,6.2116,2.1758,4.281,3.9225,5.0317,0.0106,0.4709,3.3569,4.4309,5.3973,7.2534,2.1709,2.1974,2.3359,4.7656,0.281,2.7725,1.0191,5.3909,3.3441,0.5966,0.7138,0.185,3.6581,5.9718,0.0608,1.6733,0.6103,4.0537,0.7332,1.9631,3.3579,3.9007,5.1827,0.1161,4.9815,4.1184,4.1021,0.4878,2.2592,2.6775,3.8292,5.8475,0.8161,5.5552,7.6643,2.2793,1.5999,2.9834,1.2031,0.0343,4.8653,1.2308,2.6189,0.2082,2.4058,3.28,3.3566,2.0456,1.766,3.1124,1.6281,0.007,4.1084,3.6306,0.1453,1.8408,0.9362,1.8458,1.3781,0.7802,1.9824,3.5237,0.2519,2.1387,6.4416,2.3316,0.6869,0.7386,0.9329,1.142,4.4264,2.4653,0.2599,5.7535,0.4456,4.0929,6.3056,0.0023,2.5278,5.8556,0.6605,2.1975,1.182,4.7221,1.1636,2.097,2.7444,8.0781,2.5718,1.0042,6.2591,4.3306,3.6544,5.5898,4.3969,0.4608,3.7621,2.4403,0.2372,1.5852,6.1959,4.5256,1.7459,4.6473,1.8003,0.7816,4.0011,8.4861,6.3015,1.2476,4.3773,0.3571,0.4904,0.3806,0.1121,0.0004,1.3295,1.5505,0.1151,0.2932,1.4311,5.9545,0.2285,1.5537,2.5721,3.4723,1.6432,2.5225,2.5122,3.2026,1.2331,3.3194,2.5069,6.8231,1.873,2.6901,1.014,6.7361,0.6836,2.3031,4.5084,1.3829,0.0322,5.429,1.1792,7.5992,0.0213,0.2027,2.7878,5.1176,2.1651,0.307,6.4433,0.3335,0.0352,7.3692,1.0153,6.5181,3.301,2.2981,2.6655,2.4166,1.9962,0.4036,3.0595,3.2844,1.5057,0.2442,1.1758,1.5543,0.1429,4.01,1.441,2.0164,5.3211,4.3218,3.9566,2.3638,3.8065,4.4252,6.8457,1.9898,5.353,3.1569,0.2163,3.982,1.7744,7.4202,2.1937,0.7763,3.6392,6.1363,5.3077,1.8866,3.7667,0.522,3.7331,2.8635,1.4877,0.0827,3.7471,0.1795,1.4239,1.2359,1.5575,2.0605,1.6354,1.8664,1.2317,5.4467,2.9035,1.6908,4.0389,5.195,0.8638,4.5237,6.4624,0.0891,4.3494,5.0945,1.7627,1.4407,3.962,1.928,2.6018,0.0366,1.6931,3.284,6.2971,1.8039,1.0285,1.0024,1.3601,3.6674,3.0959,0.6817,4.4675,1.2324,4.8751,5.3523,5.5993,0.0833,0.0019,2.556,3.3506,5.5316,0.2378,7.3239,0.8184,2.7547,0.2143,0.5977,3.0271,5.0259,4.4888,0.2977,4.4777,2.3041,7.0061,2.8752,0.0669,10.0235,1.207,5.8396,0.0164,3.6541,0.4217,2.2656,2.1573,3.8053,5.7196,0.8757,2.9409,3.765,1.094,2.1512,1.7571,1.0029,3.2828,4.822,10.2703,0.7167,0.0043]}

Before a meeting with U.S.","text":"Britain s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called on the United States on Wednesday to present its proposal to revive the Middle East peace process as a matter of priority. Before a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday the British foreign minister told reporters that a comprehensive agreement to end the war is crucial and that all the current initiatives aimed at getting it out must be taken seriously. \u201cWe certainly do need to do this for peace to be restored in the Middle East,\u201d said the British Foreign Minister. \u201cIt is a complex process. But the more we move in a step-by-step process on this basis, the better it will be for everyone. The better it will be for us in the UK, for us in Israel and in the Palestinian territories.\u201d \u201cI think we have the right to know who will become Prime Minister of Israel and so on. They [President Trump] should be clear not only with the parties that he thinks will join but also the extent of his agreement and his position in relation to [former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu],\u201d a British Foreign Ministry spokesman added. The U.S.-Israeli peace plan has been proposed by President Donald Trump on Thursday and is being met with mixed reactions in the region. While many in the Arab world have expressed rejection of the U.S. proposal, President Trump has not spoken specifically about it at all. On Wednesday the British Foreign Minister said the United States offered itself to make a proposal aimed to \u201cnormalize\u201d relations with Iran to \u201ccome up with a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.\u201d A British Foreign Ministry spokesman said the British Foreign Minister gave an \u201cintensely important call\u201d to Pompeo on \u201cthis very important issue\u201d and asked Pompeo to \u201ccontinue to support all initiatives to get an agreement out there.\u201d Pompeo told reporters before the meeting that he intends to make \u201can ongoing and ongoing effort to facilitate a return to the negotiating table\u201d among those involved in the Middle East peace effort. Asked what the president said to the British Foreign Minister about Iran, the U.S. Secretary of State said he \u201chad a frank discussion\u201d with Johnson. \u201cWe discussed the latest developments that have taken place in Iran on the nuclear negotiations and what it means to achieve a successful outcome of those negotiations. I expressed to Mr. Johnson my expectation that that is something that we can still achieve and that that is not possible at this point.\u201d \u201cIf we are willing to negotiate and if Iran wants to do more, if they are willing to back down on their policies and if there is enough political will to reach a deal, there is still a path that exists,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want

{"prompt":"Chinese tourists are still visiting Pyongyang from China s border city of Dandong , tourism sources say , even after authorities unofficially halted the tours just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s visit to","text":"Chinese tourists are still visiting Pyongyang from China s border city of Dandong, tourism sources say, even after authorities unofficially halted the tours just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s visit to the North Korea. At Dandong North Korea has an official airport run by North Korea s Airports Coordination Committee. The airport and related terminals are officially run by North Korea. In reality, however, there is a private operator who has a very small airport in Dandong, named Dandong Airport, and they also use Chinese tour operators. In late April, travel agents told a reporter from the New York Times that all of their Chinese customers who had booked trips to the airport in northeastern China for August and September had been offered refunds after North Korea changed their mind. Since the first of July 2018, the Chinese tour agents and officials from the Airports\nCoordination Committee in North Korea agreed to stop the flights from Dandong and other provincial airports into North Korea. Now, according to the Chinese tour operators, tourists can leave as they do normally in Dandong and have been taken directly to North Korean capital Pyongyang. So, the question is why stop flights through Dandong when it is not the North s official airport. It is possible the North s government is not happy with flights through Dandong but why do not the North s government shut down flights to the destination? Because it is the Chinese tour operators who are in charge and not North Korean authorities. So, the North Koreans may be trying to avoid a confrontation with Beijing. North Korea recently opened up its tourism sector to foreigners. The first tourists to visit North Korea arrived last December, but few Chinese tourists have visited North Korea since President Donald Trump visited. The visit to the North was the first time an American president visited the country. Some Chinese tour operators, however, still say it is possible for Chinese tourists to visit North Korea. They say their customers are not the government, but rather private individuals who wish to visit the country. They say they do not see any problem with Chinese tourists visiting North Korea. The United Nations says there are more than 300,000 registered visitors to North Korea, with tens of thousands more, both foreign tourists and North Koreans, taking smaller trips on their own. North Korea is often held up as a test ground for new products and services. But the trade ministry of China says there are several issues that stop further development of bilateral relations in South Korea s economic partnership agreement, or EPA. One of the issues is that Japan has imposed a visa regime in which only Japanese nationals can enter Japan to business meetings or travel, as well as travel to China.\nThey have restricted foreign residents to business meetings and travel only with Japanese entry visas. And this is a big problem. We said this to the Japanese ministry of foreign affairs a few days ago, and they are continuing to say they have made a lot of efforts and that it is in their system, and they will continue to work on it. So we re hoping that all of these things will come together, so we can help to develop the EPA and improve the economic and trade relations between South Korea and Japan.","token_len":642,"entropy":[10.0389,2.6601,4.6682,4.5878,6.7532,4.5885,2.7339,10.9931,7.9908,3.1112,0.7113,3.459,0.3294,0.0005,1.2712,8.6699,5.3051,1.9824,2.0685,5.6441,2.6517,5.0918,9.3316,1.6994,0.0002,4.5086,1.3767,5.4,6.2448,5.549,0.0153,6.6456,0.0411,0.4159,0.1443,0.2974,0.211,0.0043,8.629,1.3066,1.9643,0.5071,2.7261,3.3926,1.4866,6.16,6.41,0.0039,0.0023,7.8169,2.7695,4.1376,4.6774,2.7991,4.3341,6.9677,0.1052,4.035,1.0792,7.7243,5.977,4.6635,7.8688,0.5699,3.2647,1.8578,2.1444,1.8397,4.7335,7.5602,4.6587,0.892,6.6766,2.9227,0.0906,2.3019,0.221,3.4668,3.6315,5.4004,0.2371,4.2872,0.0049,3.0282,0.994,2.4771,5.3578,7.0706,2.2353,3.1183,3.103,5.0773,3.1315,3.2061,2.0247,0.9819,0.0029,0.0016,1.3875,7.419,3.4816,1.4567,0.0198,3.0595,1.699,2.5145,4.9429,4.1274,4.5521,4.9667,5.5131,1.4267,1.5858,3.1063,5.2279,2.6707,0.424,6.9898,2.4933,4.2989,3.3196,3.9771,2.4213,1.2471,4.0458,0.0344,0.2244,0.3311,5.3291,1.7204,2.4882,2.2661,3.4311,3.8657,3.0283,2.3457,4.5959,0.4862,1.3378,5.4488,2.2217,9.4694,0.5352,3.481,7.2271,2.8335,0.0671,2.4757,1.0444,5.462,4.1907,3.4865,4.5183,0.199,6.4836,1.0423,2.8321,0.8193,5.4192,1.9795,5.3979,3.8413,4.0399,6.7536,0.1511,2.2666,1.9944,1.9033,5.3798,3.5835,5.1755,2.7488,1.3588,5.3087,1.0601,9.2269,12.9003,2.1731,0.3267,0.1762,2.9216,2.6786,0.0373,6.9878,0.3078,2.6622,2.1166,3.4655,2.2182,1.1378,0.0041,0.0018,2.0425,2.8914,7.0226,1.3797,6.241,1.9519,0.0372,1.2738,5.8259,0.7391,4.1794,0.0019,1.8514,2.6224,2.3925,0.8576,0.2922,4.9921,3.2815,4.1031,5.9491,2.9995,5.7994,4.3079,2.8047,2.9315,0.0048,0.002,1.2974,5.3072,4.2655,5.0475,4.638,0.2084,1.9771,2.9723,4.8151,0.5243,0.7503,4.9215,1.8999,2.7697,5.871,0.9971,4.1794,6.7475,4.2336,5.7702,0.7219,0.0036,0.0019,4.2416,2.9736,0.6087,3.1228,2.7538,2.9819,8.9296,3.9,0.9118,2.4418,3.4472,0.7652,3.1874,3.2778,2.8023,1.9791,2.7222,1.9439,3.4368,4.828,0.4607,7.7542,2.0396,0.4465,0.0061,0.0021,3.608,6.532,3.7069,3.0904,4.2177,3.6633,0.6211,1.4957,5.0382,0.6485,2.0376,1.4254,2.1805,7.0796,1.6675,4.9119,2.6554,0.6764,2.6155,2.6476,1.1584,0.1479,0.4399,0.8515,4.1407,0.4155,2.7175,2.9459,3.5974,1.2319,2.6197,0.482,3.3771,0.3655,1.831,3.3126,2.6443,3.1601,1.3632,2.8844,0.0323,3.6194,2.7278,2.7817,0.8831,3.5685,1.3952,4.3133,0.3055,5.0936,4.7311,2.8308,1.2265,6.703,3.4113,1.1287,2.9132,1.7511,2.2237,3.8234,4.7372,1.2399,0.973,1.8468,0.0278,4.8567,3.3789,4.0414,2.0918,3.0193,5.9997,3.6245,1.6837,1.5187,2.4785,1.9399,0.0162,0.7849,7.6012,1.2116,0.0199,2.7711,1.7788,2.2092,5.6155,2.1346,1.8616,1.1042,3.8939,3.1311,0.5399,1.5984,4.4424,1.1979,3.0097,1.4812,0.9088,0.5708,1.1944,5.6697,1.9117,3.6925,0.0616,3.1744,1.6136,0.0033,4.5105,4.1347,3.0652,0.334,3.2405,1.611,1.9573,0.431,0.1555,1.9508,0.8643,0.0171,1.2184,3.031,1.1191,4.7943,3.119,1.4922,2.2639,4.7875,4.7303,2.6865,0.9235,1.9057,6.2987,4.3053,1.2221,4.9661,0.0174,1.8043,0.9746,0.318,0.6263,2.829,1.0584,1.7437,2.6638,0.044,3.6358,1.2208,2.9869,0.6879,2.3304,0.6951,1.5899,0.9486,0.0129,0.8155,2.4199,4.9832,2.5145,3.7614,2.6715,0.5641,2.8109,0.0518,3.6125,0.455,0.0014,5.2887,1.9419,0.21,0.5373,0.0078,1.6899,3.3244,5.2576,0.0493,0.0906,1.3532,7.2787,5.7847,3.1015,3.9031,0.0417,2.4476,0.8022,2.7327,6.1169,12.2088,2.3956,4.5454,2.0135,0.764,0.3585,3.3245,0.29,2.3989,5.5985,6.5427,0.6077,0.1111,0.6355,3.8189,5.9752,0.226,5.5381,6.4447,1.0875,2.6907,1.2269,2.571,2.0309,5.81,6.1959,2.8071,1.6415,1.7091,1.9537,0.4004,4.6675,5.105,1.7096,7.2908,8.7967,4.3114,0.4433,7.6319,1.6106,3.5694,5.5418,0.1054,8.9197,4.8628,4.3146,6.6682,2.8506,5.3107,14.2721,0.9361,3.635,0.9892,0.7106,1.8708,0.8307,1.7446,5.6914,1.8249,5.4169,1.6631,4.7025,4.8257,3.0032,4.5948,4.6946,1.5354,1.577,1.1752,0.81,3.7583,4.0124,7.8648,4.9556,3.0516,3.3388,3.4002,3.2608,1.6713,0.0092,4.1175,1.0127,3.1547,0.9074,4.8918,6.8737,3.7969,6.5041,3.4127,5.7982,2.0821,5.3799,0.3589,1.2898,1.2363,2.8386,4.3347,1.7488,8.9317,1.8975,0.637,4.8259,4.3784,1.4056,2.5232,3.5675,0.8917,1.9579,5.2444,5.462,3.3769,3.2001,1.0981,1.6621,4.4477,0.8277,0.9739,0.0743,4.2758,0.716,1.5278,0.0846,1.307,1.2973,1.1285,3.293,5.2695,0.5432,2.7163,2.3937,2.3353,4.1908,2.4259,2.7649,0.0242,3.6262,4.1443,3.1274,2.8264,0.4774,4.2581,0.9847,8.2592,2.5877,1.5761,1.3441,2.4242,1.4485,0.2346,2.6849,1.5686,0.7214,0.46,2.6203,3.2182,10.5202,11.3397,0.7607,4.4667,1.1635,1.4328,2.4377,0.7943,3.1553,2.1382,2.2607,3.9485,2.1804,0.9478,4.4378,3.038,3.8207,1.7487,8.5003,2.4124,4.302,1.081,4.3588,3.5412,0.9605,1.3118,0.8817,2.9269,0.0877,0.0899,0.2104,0.4245]}

Speaking at a United Nations headquarters in New York where she visited the site with her son, an aid worker, and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, the\nU.S. Ambassador said the world could do better helping those displaced, and it was the job of the UN and other organizations to do so. \u201c I \u2019 m just so inspired by these young people who are willing to fight the battle at the frontline\nto help not only their fellow Congolese, but other people too, \u201d Haley said. \u201d I think we can do so much better and I am just so inspired. \u201d Since the early 2000s, nearly 1 million people have fled Congo, according to the United Nations agency, the vast majority going to Rwanda, Uganda and neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. One\nmillion of the 1.4 million refugees arrived in Rwanda, and that number remains steady year-over-year, a report issued by refugees to an international aid agency last July showed. The number of people entering Rwanda over the last six years has exceeded that of all refugees who left Syria. In Uganda, the number of people in camps increased nearly 100 percent from 2014 to 2016, according to the UNHCR\nThe most recent estimate of Congolese refugees in the world comes from 2015. It was nearly 1 million, more than the number of refugees who had fled North Africa and the Middle East. In 2016, the UN estimates the number of Congolese refugees in the world would have risen to nearly 1.5 million. Grandi welcomed the fact that some Congolese displaced are living with their families after years of flight. \u201c Congolese have suffered for decades, but today we are witnessing a moment of enormous hope, \u201d he said. \u201c But the United Nations and all\ninterested parties must now support these peace efforts to protect the civilians. \u201c As refugees return to their country of origin, their plight is just as critical as ever\nfor the country and its people, \u201d Mr. Grandi said. \u201d The world can do better by supporting the peace efforts of the Congolese and ensuring access for humanitarian\noperations to reach those in need. At this site, Haley said that one of the men she met in the camp spoke eloquently about the impact of war with many of those living in it, and the need to reach out for the world to do better in their situation.

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and","text":"Two senior U.S. House of Representatives Republicans said on Friday they have agreed on terms for the reauthorization of the deeply indebted National Flood Insurance Program. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, both top Republicans in the House Homeland Security Committee, said they would be able to reach a bipartisan deal on the bill this year, if lawmakers so choose.\nThe proposal to replace the current, flawed flood insurance system with another that would cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars to construct and run over next 10 years has been the subject of considerable debate.\nBut the Republicans who negotiated with the other major financial players -- including insurance industry lobbyists and industry backers -- insisted on a number of specific reforms aimed at improving the disaster management of a nation plagued by hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters.\nScalise, a Louisiana Democrat, and Jordan, a Republican from Ohio's Cincinnati-area, said they had made concessions on the package to assure that insurance companies could continue selling flood insurance to people even after the program was shuttered, a topic of longstanding dispute in Congress.\n\"The bill needs to pass and it needs to pass clean,\" Scalise told reporters. \"We need to get this done as quickly as possible, and that's not a political statement. The insurance industry has decided they need to close the program. They don't care what the cost is and they don't care how many people are left out of it.\"\nThe new funding proposal would also increase the amount that can be insured by as many as 25 percent, from what the current level is. It would also limit homeowners to one annual flood insurance policy at a time, to discourage insuring high-value properties more than once.\nInsurance industry officials and other stakeholders have long argued that current flood insurance rules incentivize people to insure multiple properties when one actually experiences damage from a flood to avoid paying out of pocket if one gets damaged.\nThe flood insurance program is in disarray, both because the U.S. Congress hasn't decided on a successor to it by now, and because the program has not adequately protected people from high flood insurance costs.\nThe new bill would provide for retroactive annual premium payments for current and future flood insurance policies once a new insurance program is in place. People would also receive up to four years of coverage and be assured that their current insurance policy would continue to cover them should a new program provide them with more coverage.\nThe final bill could still take years to pass. The Senate was expected to finish the process of passing the bill when it recesses in early June before President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner are scheduled to meet. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on it Thursday.\nAfter House and Senate committees complete their own versions of the final bill, they would be expected to hold a conference committee meeting to hash out minor differences and submit a unified version of the bill to lawmakers.\nU.S. President Barack Obama said last week that he was considering taking action to help homeowners who bought flood insurance but saw their policies shuttered due to the Federal Insurance Regulatory ACT, or FIRA\/FIRM.","token_len":643,"entropy":[8.9192,3.4224,0.0432,0.023,0.0026,6.6453,2.5356,0.0079,2.4064,2.4608,2.3262,2.0701,1.1158,3.6305,4.6161,2.6809,7.5839,1.5574,1.5536,6.9035,0.2967,0.0133,0.2695,0.4996,12.2063,6.3446,2.7001,3.3348,0.0073,0.0282,1.3311,4.6757,3.0998,1.9793,0.5176,0.011,0.0,2.8953,0.018,1.7418,2.9215,0.0015,3.9556,0.2492,0.2389,0.8273,2.5723,1.3775,5.6044,1.2471,1.6605,0.1314,0.4942,5.9918,0.0018,0.853,0.0296,1.7633,1.1348,1.6481,3.7708,4.7787,0.0122,4.3267,0.6612,3.1317,1.6544,1.4824,0.655,2.6285,4.5369,3.171,2.3001,4.169,3.8299,6.8548,0.4663,0.1095,0.2977,15.5987,4.6472,3.0092,4.3788,0.2613,3.842,5.4479,5.6432,3.5489,0.1213,3.7713,1.4476,5.1842,5.3049,2.1286,5.7411,2.4563,4.4812,0.0402,0.3758,0.3301,0.0033,4.5064,5.4022,1.934,3.0429,5.6632,7.074,4.9123,0.0193,2.9167,1.274,4.2239,0.3939,0.0044,4.9381,0.9025,2.0463,0.8524,2.589,1.8672,4.4318,2.7516,4.4218,2.8061,1.4768,6.8427,3.8682,5.1272,4.6288,5.0043,1.1442,7.1099,3.6703,2.8346,0.9683,4.6993,4.6036,0.8036,4.0049,1.6424,1.8542,5.6872,0.0184,3.9338,3.9717,4.3701,0.0366,2.7143,0.4846,5.7549,4.304,3.9784,4.4921,3.2553,4.331,0.2062,5.1285,1.517,1.1183,0.3808,0.6374,1.5352,0.0623,0.2427,0.2432,7.841,0.0027,0.0032,1.271,1.7844,1.7907,2.2402,0.6077,2.0938,0.3272,0.1658,0.2169,1.4335,0.5236,0.0445,5.6586,7.781,0.6051,1.2399,5.076,0.9212,0.726,2.1789,4.6872,5.9015,2.0776,1.6009,5.2073,2.1443,5.6814,1.2655,5.3416,0.6664,2.5197,2.4514,6.1915,3.9885,0.2634,2.3362,2.99,5.3658,0.7834,0.9669,3.0519,1.2588,2.3051,2.7373,2.6414,3.3028,6.4285,2.2948,7.2143,4.399,2.7726,1.0468,0.2381,0.2665,0.9021,2.3498,4.3336,5.5079,0.2346,2.8187,3.358,2.3589,0.7649,0.113,1.2885,8.9239,2.8799,0.8491,0.0003,1.7438,0.2908,1.577,0.882,1.7164,3.1111,0.3474,1.7989,2.1193,0.6766,3.2924,0.3067,0.0576,0.1729,2.054,1.2429,2.2819,0.6993,3.4693,2.5478,4.1326,4.2356,0.9835,3.092,5.4626,0.6288,1.9344,6.3005,2.7709,2.3447,0.2303,4.9282,1.6314,1.3428,1.7375,1.7952,2.8251,0.0004,3.7595,2.0069,1.7797,2.1219,0.6687,4.0114,0.5278,1.326,0.0002,0.2865,2.3422,1.7437,0.6556,1.0947,3.4999,2.436,1.2332,1.5921,0.6712,0.0454,1.5193,4.6695,3.7734,4.0294,1.599,2.8131,3.9938,0.7664,2.0638,3.4109,3.7755,0.0422,6.8576,1.9081,7.9611,1.3469,0.0285,3.976,2.1579,1.5329,2.7828,5.302,1.8409,4.1669,4.2121,0.7985,1.2259,2.4721,0.4271,0.7928,5.0054,9.3491,5.1715,3.1426,4.6503,4.335,0.3673,1.3343,4.0233,0.5459,0.2928,0.9895,3.4003,5.7587,7.9976,0.1441,5.3834,0.1135,3.8951,2.4557,5.9524,0.8577,3.9812,1.5138,0.3778,7.2941,0.8837,2.5222,2.476,2.9156,3.2777,3.0647,1.7832,2.7757,2.0514,0.13,5.8439,1.5303,0.0967,4.0577,6.906,0.0785,3.4509,0.2554,4.2038,5.3038,1.8641,4.0707,4.7899,6.5954,10.2582,4.4793,3.6951,1.2525,1.4644,6.7129,2.8938,2.4373,2.4798,2.192,0.0524,5.7193,2.8799,4.2448,2.5175,1.7518,0.7743,1.7603,5.1148,0.0975,2.1102,1.8924,4.3436,5.0867,0.095,1.3587,6.429,1.697,3.2976,3.7524,0.0005,0.0032,0.0013,3.7272,3.9628,0.0004,4.9713,1.8,0.8949,6.171,0.8648,3.1282,4.7834,4.7493,1.9753,0.2092,0.226,1.8068,4.0722,1.4635,2.8358,5.3801,3.1646,2.9512,0.8585,5.4559,2.1586,2.0026,1.4774,0.6147,0.7116,1.7012,3.0826,3.7527,0.7885,3.3949,2.2066,8.051,0.0932,6.8469,4.4728,2.661,1.7247,5.488,1.2824,1.6119,1.5822,0.2502,1.0771,6.8547,3.2497,3.5849,3.7526,2.9498,0.6649,2.5476,0.0545,0.5183,7.5045,1.7619,2.0057,2.7875,3.7739,0.0027,4.4017,0.4463,0.3722,3.0287,3.921,3.6431,7.5723,0.8499,1.5734,3.0907,1.8597,1.5383,1.0674,2.37,0.3478,0.6482,0.607,7.4977,1.9641,1.7141,1.9497,6.9219,2.8014,0.6129,2.9222,0.9674,0.269,0.3525,1.395,5.8841,1.7275,4.2702,3.8513,4.3813,2.494,0.3493,2.1722,2.2334,2.2809,3.295,4.4787,1.1009,0.0391,5.769,1.9348,1.753,2.3204,2.1021,0.5303,0.9152,5.3729,0.8917,10.5202,1.592,2.0068,2.4733,2.7207,6.1188,4.3045,0.8325,0.0044,3.3049,4.1664,0.7755,0.0025,0.0029,8.4728,0.0018,1.3417,0.0069,3.4403,1.1786,0.0075,1.0295,3.4392,2.8424,0.6529,2.7242,0.0092,1.4262,0.5342,0.0197,1.6172,0.2778,2.2971,3.9769,0.5281,0.3111,5.0827,4.828,3.4378,0.0085,4.7199,6.0967,0.5587,5.0237,4.1011,0.0548,0.0705,5.0571,0.5388,0.5485,2.5332,2.0859,2.8483,2.3813,0.0191,4.6046,0.8852,2.9572,1.5494,2.1317,1.1197,6.1819,0.0827,9.3283,2.3523,2.3439,6.0978,1.8295,6.41,1.8064,1.1852,0.0963,0.8434,0.8906,3.6424,0.6879,0.6547,6.5438,0.011,0.0032,0.0016,3.6034,0.3482,0.0055,2.7368,3.4029,0.4454,0.3913,0.9642,1.9762,3.5729,4.948,0.9577,0.547,3.0106,4.6589,2.2929,5.9132,0.845,0.1097,2.5476,6.1515,2.6627,2.7348,5.2877,0.7842,3.836,0.0055,2.0167,6.9584,6.4065,2.6658,17.9422,1.0588,0.8565,8.2256,0.044,9.4284,6.9538,3.5701,1.0938]}

He also repeatedly urged Congress to act on a trade deal with Europe, Canada and Mexico that would make America \u201cbetter off.\u201d He told reporters in March that \u201cthey will eventually find that they lost a lot more than they would have if they did not negotiate.\u201d\nIn that effort, Trump also tried to placate the European Union, where many Republicans are wary of trading with him since his campaign raised the prospect of further restrictions on immigration from Muslim-majority countries.\nWhen he told lawmakers over the weekend that he wanted the European Union-led negotiations to move forward in March, Trump said he wanted the negotiators to agree to a deal \u201con some kind of reasonable agreement\u2026that will make our country better off.\u201d \u201cWe should not be fighting over silly stuff like immigration and trade policy,\u201d he later said. \u201cWe should be fighting over our economy which is our number one issue.\u201d\nThe President\u2019s initial plans to take the European Union negotiations on trade in the US to Congress were called into question by Trump, and on Monday, the trade team announced that the Treasury Department would sign the US-European Union trade deal on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign has signaled that it may be interested in cutting off funding to political nonprofits that fundraise in support of policies Trump opposes such as raising military spending or immigration reform.\nIn a meeting with Republican congressional leaders on Monday, Trump claimed immigration issues were not the focus of a trade deal with Europe, although he also noted that the EU \u201chas been a strong ally of the United States on many

The Sport models also feature a new colour called \u2018Mediterranean White\u2019 accented with blue stitchings, a contrasting colour in the armrests and centre console inserts, and blue embroidery on the doors.","token_len":643,"entropy":[8.0844,2.8401,3.3779,0.0014,9.6683,0.0431,1.3748,5.7703,1.2883,2.6142,2.0514,6.5065,1.2738,2.0553,2.9399,2.6913,3.3297,1.0508,1.1015,4.9308,0.3788,2.2003,5.6676,9.4431,5.556,3.7772,3.1541,0.937,0.9035,0.0047,3.9096,3.8896,3.6001,0.6987,0.3039,0.1351,15.6777,5.1208,5.5513,4.6317,3.2287,3.1511,2.3696,4.4827,3.6748,4.7291,1.2658,2.6743,0.2308,2.6646,1.7509,2.0839,1.1707,11.5748,0.7434,0.4339,4.2098,3.6611,0.5597,0.3614,2.7036,1.2105,6.2161,3.3578,5.5275,7.3072,0.7094,3.7373,2.8542,2.339,2.617,1.3169,0.2932,0.2414,13.5346,1.9141,4.4893,0.1197,3.2054,5.0279,6.0894,1.1428,1.143,6.8868,0.4849,1.7014,3.9125,0.0368,3.9202,1.9521,1.2815,2.3993,0.0114,0.4058,0.2785,0.0004,0.1744,1.9282,4.7419,0.043,3.2827,2.3184,4.8692,2.9678,0.7846,1.7108,4.3139,1.6245,0.6262,0.0912,1.1766,0.4156,6.62,6.9844,2.5907,6.7678,1.1911,8.6614,6.3356,1.6341,6.0939,5.6837,0.9693,8.5867,0.2179,8.2118,0.5543,0.1127,0.3144,3.8263,3.8165,0.0521,1.3916,0.8402,12.0364,1.9608,3.4824,6.7085,6.7318,9.059,6.2306,0.1377,3.3694,1.6661,9.2743,0.91,0.5275,3.4466,5.8755,3.1367,1.6733,0.1794,2.1356,2.1372,14.5376,12.6646,0.0385,8.1047,13.5909,5.4677,0.7919,3.0705,5.3044,0.7646,1.2216,4.8038,1.6054,1.9399,5.4651,2.052,7.6538,3.7856,1.1343,8.2562,5.7442,2.5222,6.4515,5.4862,0.8457,0.3033,5.1398,4.6825,3.0811,0.8162,4.6984,5.6577,4.5913,1.6578,4.2425,0.6667,1.6937,0.3856,4.1702,0.0393,1.3471,1.8437,7.6397,2.2199,1.5879,4.9102,0.1098,0.2028,0.4049,0.0178,8.8266,2.2079,1.7015,7.0414,0.7125,13.4443,3.4848,0.4905,0.5469,5.6519,4.9552,10.5589,0.0537,1.8128,4.5967,2.5246,2.3884,3.0597,2.1313,3.9362,3.899,0.0036,1.2946,1.4495,4.1944,5.0363,2.0294,0.4125,0.3973,3.5963,4.146,4.5985,0.1246,0.4567,4.7916,0.0104,3.3365,0.37,1.0762,2.7348,2.534,0.4736,1.0438,2.0109,1.8363,1.8842,3.726,1.3499,3.1369,0.0554,0.314,2.6197,0.0038,6.1111,1.2155,8.0506,1.6838,0.3871,8.0494,4.8291,0.1124,0.7749,0.0059,0.7,3.9805,17.3909,7.7677,2.2907,2.7299,0.0253,7.5697,0.6473,2.9071,0.1229,0.749,0.2636,0.3475,0.2715,1.4593,10.0451,4.1673,0.1559,0.7515,0.0878,0.636,0.0049,5.692,3.188,0.9456,0.0003,0.6145,0.8378,1.7742,5.4755,0.0756,4.6302,0.6389,0.8626,6.1687,1.4694,0.3531,0.4198,4.7118,0.6511,1.9294,2.3324,3.5864,0.9019,0.1997,0.6757,0.146,1.4905,4.5187,3.5859,2.9464,1.7015,2.051,0.2498,6.6597,1.7062,0.1592,0.0003,3.306,5.2797,4.4962,0.5562,0.9615,1.2038,6.2944,0.7931,4.6392,0.0013,0.6074,6.1206,6.6435,1.4631,0.3153,0.0693,1.1926,3.1527,5.2111,0.0558,0.2237,0.0735,0.424,0.002,1.0752,7.2638,1.6187,0.9128,3.482,1.9316,9.9922,3.0635,3.3658,2.3203,0.2683,0.6141,3.9232,0.6519,0.1446,0.9835,0.4437,2.0283,4.0812,3.3994,0.6925,2.1035,3.4253,4.6917,0.2203,0.6354,1.1896,2.7358,1.9861,0.9511,8.3669,0.0028,0.8714,1.2686,1.0565,5.6131,0.7542,2.1503,0.6235,0.0013,0.3431,9.254,0.1834,5.31,0.2897,1.5247,5.3744,4.4427,0.1287,2.6874,2.2544,2.5694,7.5829,10.9205,0.3917,0.1321,8.2051,0.5286,2.4866,6.8625,6.083,0.0132,0.0,0.0367,1.6897,7.6751,1.6974,0.9726,6.9198,5.3821,0.8471,5.4087,4.2201,1.5694,4.0439,6.1191,4.1477,3.8906,0.9581,6.0948,3.0307,0.7432,1.8371,1.9597,4.0967,4.8092,4.5885,0.0708,3.7978,0.3126,0.9057,0.9997,1.7916,0.1245,0.0008,0.219,4.4505,1.9688,3.465,1.5173,1.0251,4.4071,0.5338,7.457,3.7338,7.8024,0.8686,0.757,4.336,4.3961,1.3161,1.4247,3.6782,3.406,1.5764,0.6588,6.1987,1.6941,0.0615,2.6765,3.0945,8.0775,7.1948,0.7292,2.8183,6.5159,1.6409,4.2754,2.852,1.8126,3.1309,0.1134,0.0225,0.9795,2.0982,5.0133,0.0042,1.433,3.9742,2.6179,1.2409,5.0209,3.7985,5.0973,10.9857,4.3133,2.6505,0.2745,7.7055,5.5346,0.3018,1.2247,8.528,3.2102,0.3338,0.012,3.417,1.8058,4.111,3.7742,1.2801,4.4244,8.7266,3.0714,4.9037,0.9528,1.4479,5.0575,1.2853,0.0578,2.8446,2.567,2.0372,0.333,0.8079,3.395,5.7058,0.0022,4.247,1.7321,7.7375,4.8355,11.6836,7.1307,1.5933,4.0925,5.1356,9.8608,5.8242,2.8673,3.3357,1.0076,3.4147,1.9143,0.7226,0.9,1.8806,3.1952,2.7123,2.5028,5.7869,3.7938,0.5012,0.5885,0.7917,4.7201,0.3522,0.0416,0.6994,7.9952,1.2205,2.7003,4.9495,0.0185,4.4208,2.686,1.064,5.2531,8.0586,6.4441,0.4986,0.7906,4.3512,2.3831,8.796,0.2508,3.8384,0.0362,5.1154,2.5752,3.35,0.7531,10.3035,2.475,1.1747,6.3908,6.0043,3.5501,9.8839,1.2143,4.0048,10.1952,0.126,1.831,3.4712,1.6329,0.4572,0.9113,4.5258,1.2661,1.6803,1.8533,1.1194,2.0704,5.6587,8.8517,7.6591,6.2953,9.6985,2.0355,4.7207,4.1967,0.7085,10.5608,0.0054,0.8403,3.7008,8.8285,5.2414,2.0309,1.9875,4.7896,3.8018,4.1692,0.5284,8.12,0.0242,2.186,1.1077,6.0774,0.1219,7.7305,1.2059,0.6517,4.1945,4.3462,1.1006,0.0075,1.8574,0.1715,4.7511,0.7965]}
{"prompt":"Rex Tillerson , dogged by media speculation about how long he will last as U.S. secretary of state , tried on Tuesday to ease skepticism among staff about his leadership and planned State Department reorganization","text":"Rex Tillerson, dogged by media speculation about how long he will last as U.S. secretary of state, tried on Tuesday to ease skepticism among staff about his leadership and planned State Department reorganization.\n\u201cThere is no reason to think that Mr. Tillerson has lost touch with what America is, is it not?\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has released a new report which examines the effectiveness of mental health care for teenagers and young adults. With around one in five young people considering suicide, the report identifies a gap in mental health care for teens and young adults, suggesting that it is the young people themselves who do not see mental health as important enough to seek help. The report also discusses the increasing prevalence of self-harm among UK adolescents, highlighting that more needs to be done to support at-risk teenagers in the period before they consider self-harm. See full article here.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is to evaluate the effectiveness of mental health care for children and young people. This, in the past, has not been done due to lack of robust evidence.\nIn the new review, NICE will review existing trials of psychotherapeutic treatments (both CBT and behavioural interventions) alongside new research on other treatments such as mindfulness meditation and mind-body therapy. The evaluation will look at what works for the individual and for society as a whole. NICE\u2019s Director of Evidence, Dr Chris Green, says it is important there is a review of effectiveness of treatment before services can be developed. It is expected the review comes mid-year 2017, and is backed by the government\u2019s \u00a320m Teenage Mental Health Review. NICE will then conduct an economic evaluation, taking a look at how these treatments cost the health system, and whether they are worth the money. See full article here.\nA recent study in The Lancet found that in the period from 2003 to 2010 there was a 21% increase in the number of people who are deemed to be at high risk of suicide, and more than 600,000 people self-harmed during this period. Those who suffered self-harming acts were more likely to be female and to live in poorer communities and with parents who have never achieved higher educational degrees. The study found the incidence of suicide for men and women have converged since 1980. In 2011, the mean age for men and women who died by suicide was 27.5 and 31.8 respectively, falling to 29.5 and 30.0 years, respectively, in 2010. The study also found that the rates of suicide have declined steadily across all age groups, particularly in older age groups such as those over 55 years, where there has been a 45% drop in deaths from 2009 to 2011. The decline has been particularly rapid where male suicides have reduced from 8,930 deaths in 2009 to 3,700 in 2011 (a 60% decline), though women still die more than men do. This was also highlighted by an analysis by the Coronation Foundation, which showed in the past year, 1,120 more suicide deaths happened in men than in women.

{"prompt":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that a draft bill that sets limits on police investigators should be revised so it does not apply to criminal probes in which he is a suspect","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that a draft bill that sets limits on police investigators should be revised so it does not apply to criminal probes in which he is a suspect.\nMr Netanyahu was referring to the draft bill that was approved on Thursday by a coalition of Israeli parties, including his Likud.\n\u201cThere is a difference between a man who is a suspect in a criminal investigation and a politician who takes responsibility by admitting himself as a suspect,\u201d he told a joint news conference with his Israeli Interior Minister Avigdor Lieberman and the former foreign minister Avigdor Shalit. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Netanyahu had referred to the so-called \u201cShlosha\u201d laws that limit what police investigators can do to collect circumstantial evidence on a case being investigated.\nMr Netanyahu said the proposal should not cover all criminal investigations. \u201cIn my view, the bill should not be able to affect criminal investigations of a political nature. \u2026 Our government agrees that a political investigation should not affect citizens\u2019 lives,\u201d Mr Netanyahu added.\nIn Israel, political investigations are investigated by the prime minister\u2019s office or a cabinet committee under the control of a political party.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that limiting the work of a police investigation to this extent is right, but we must think that something else is wrong,\u201d Mr Netanyahu said.\nSince the beginning of June, the ruling coalition led by Mr Netanyahu and its main partner, the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, has been accused by opposition parties and an influential group of prosecutors of colluding with corruption and fraud scandals involving Yisrael Beiteinu party officials and the heads of various ministries who had been accused of receiving and trying to hide large amounts of bribes.\n\u201cAny restriction on the right to investigation of police is wrong. Even an investigator who is a political suspect has the right to investigate his political opponent. This is the rule in the legal system,\u201d Ms Tzipi Hotovely, a leading member of the Kulanu party, told Reuters.\nTwo weeks ago, a joint committee consisting of three members of the powerful prosecution agency Mossad and three members of the attorney-general\u2019s office wrote to the leaders of the Kulanu, Gantz and Joint List parties in protest against the draft legislation.\n\u201cThis is a blatant restriction the police and the prosecution agencies have in their investigation. It interferes with the right to the presumption of innocence and the principle of objectivity,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their letter. The letter went on to argue that \u201cthe draft law does not have a legal ground for the investigation.\u201d\nThe lawmakers demanded that the draft be put aside until its legitimacy is evaluated,

{"prompt":"The United States on Thursday said it welcomed an announcement by a Saudi-led coalition to keep the Hodeidah port in Yemen open for a month and allow humanitarian aid to flow through , and condemned","text":"The United States on Thursday said it welcomed an announcement by a Saudi-led coalition to keep the Hodeidah port in Yemen open for a month and allow humanitarian aid to flow through, and condemned attacks on humanitarian workers in Yemen.\nThe United States also called for the Saudi-led coalition to put an end to the \"war crimes\" it has committed against civilians in Yemen.\nForeign Minister Ned Price told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that Washington and its ally Saudi Arabia had \"zero tolerance\" for attacks on humanitarian workers.\nThe Saudi-led coalition earlier in the day announced that it would continue to allow humanitarian aid to reach Yemen's southern port of Hodeidah, where the United Nations has long been helping in the evacuation of refugees fleeing the war, after a month-long shutdown.\nA U.N. agency said the announcement left thousands of people without humanitarian aid, which they needed in a worst-affected crisis in a country of about 22 million.\nThe Hodeidah port was reopened in April for humanitarian aid and a slow flow of refugees, with tens of thousands making the trek across the Red Sea with the help of a U.N. ship and boats on nearby waterways. But there are now reports that humanitarian aid workers have yet to make it to the site and humanitarian deliveries have been severely disrupted since a wave of raids by Houthi and allied militias.\nYemen's U.N.-backed interim government earlier on Thursday called for its forces to leave two locations in Houthi strongholds as part of a deal to reopen a port for humanitarian deliveries.\nThe location of the port deal, which remains undisclosed, was critical for the survival of the 2,800 families still on the port and the other 20,000 who live in the area surrounding the port.\nThe U.N. agency said it had been unable to deliver food and water to the families because of the Houthi siege and their fear of the air force.\n\"We call on all parties to ensure unhindered access for all humanitarian aid to the port and all affected areas,\" the U.N. Refugee Agency said.\nThe strike on Wednesday came just hours after another Houthi bombardment killed 10 civilians and injured three, the United Nations said, with six more wounded in other raids in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah.\nThe strikes showed the depth of a conflict that has strained the world's third-biggest oil producer to the brink of famine and sparked fears of a global refugee crisis that the United Nations says could overwhelm much of the international community.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A San Francisco man was charged Thursday with three counts of second-degree murder for allegedly shooting four teenagers to death at the heart of a high-tech high school in 2015.\nAuthorities say a suspect shot two students and stabbed two others during a fight inside an auditorium at Union High School in Hayes Valley in 2015.\nInvestigators say another student was shot. He later died at a hospital but prosecutors have not called that shooting a crime.\nThe charges against Kevin Hester relate to the shooting of a 15-year-old named David Johnson, prosecutors said.","token_len":644,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,5.722,2.2054,2.883,0.5536,5.8117,3.4142,3.5377,0.7657,3.9533,4.5354,1.5484,0.1589,0.1214,1.8377,7.4417,1.6969,8.5358,4.849,0.1601,0.0028,3.7888,3.2195,1.9706,2.7443,1.6535,4.0946,2.7393,2.9594,2.9244,2.7169,1.1867,0.4946,1.4709,2.3187,3.4762,3.3985,5.6439,4.5214,1.0588,4.7991,1.2801,1.7486,1.3575,0.6659,0.2076,14.1172,1.821,0.2535,2.3647,2.5711,1.0342,1.8268,2.6141,0.3855,0.011,0.1291,0.1639,5.6609,1.2625,0.0056,0.0053,1.3429,2.6835,3.2146,1.8687,0.2705,6.427,0.9,1.7954,0.8577,1.5653,1.1818,0.3796,1.0653,0.2313,6.7249,0.8505,13.3164,0.045,2.2406,1.4464,5.4576,1.5742,0.0906,0.195,0.273,0.8463,4.0443,3.225,1.9297,4.7041,0.4444,0.0032,1.7119,2.0678,5.076,0.1635,0.2466,0.3237,2.54,0.9014,3.4525,0.2318,1.6115,0.1912,1.8365,2.567,0.7218,0.0199,0.04,7.1478,3.6166,0.4827,1.1471,2.4647,1.3917,0.5646,0.9263,3.7507,0.8291,4.1839,1.0459,0.7901,0.3945,2.0123,1.8337,2.1499,3.3593,0.9286,0.4282,2.5236,0.001,0.4265,0.0006,1.1184,2.1681,2.1186,2.8114,0.7202,1.1797,4.8689,1.4062,5.2545,3.6297,1.0817,7.1493,0.1555,4.772,3.3163,1.1766,1.4037,3.9589,3.4989,1.9968,4.6803,1.9007,0.0292,8.004,0.7439,0.1998,3.6025,2.8823,0.0004,0.6792,0.0916,4.5417,0.95,2.1872,4.9259,7.1998,4.6464,0.2851,1.0916,1.5902,5.0185,0.8564,2.1466,3.6159,5.2005,5.8155,3.3366,2.5977,6.4347,0.0201,5.6081,8.2045,1.1237,3.239,2.1008,4.4834,3.0741,5.5456,0.0386,1.4252,0.2763,1.4107,4.9711,0.0178,0.0045,0.0019,0.3767,1.8808,4.0262,2.2437,2.5765,4.1345,1.6161,1.0582,2.7546,3.3138,9.8715,4.6878,0.0796,2.7648,2.9633,3.122,5.2815,0.0213,0.0117,6.3852,0.8179,3.0003,2.2347,0.3256,3.4446,0.0031,5.3443,2.3344,1.6334,0.0122,3.4718,3.147,0.0016,0.2344,0.3638,2.418,2.3812,4.6621,4.9199,7.4791,5.1506,0.1786,4.2913,4.6496,2.3213,3.3525,2.1137,0.9027,4.978,1.5531,4.1331,1.4146,5.0915,0.0048,2.9942,0.2934,0.6552,0.8057,4.4902,3.8958,4.6042,8.7287,1.7455,1.0672,5.4428,1.1237,4.6034,3.2626,4.5236,0.0116,6.7583,1.732,2.7525,0.114,4.4982,1.8628,2.7044,4.5097,0.1521,5.2077,0.0072,1.1813,5.4808,0.0022,0.0465,2.2521,1.0597,5.2665,0.0607,4.7207,1.4764,0.6682,2.479,0.6594,4.921,4.5579,0.1285,3.4522,7.6518,5.3802,1.4944,5.732,0.1372,4.5288,0.0002,5.0868,1.7839,0.001,0.763,3.8974,0.6642,6.2961,3.2042,2.2654,3.5019,1.8524,5.9954,0.9575,0.5199,1.4598,8.8481,0.6266,0.4011,1.2863,7.4632,2.1709,0.7897,5.8325,5.2621,0.1783,1.5108,5.566,1.6412,1.1823,8.2501,0.0243,1.13,6.699,0.7053,3.2449,4.6893,3.1711,4.0334,0.4439,5.7474,3.6812,1.9614,4.9353,5.3655,0.1733,0.03,2.4818,3.5007,0.867,0.9686,2.4315,6.9879,1.1844,1.0024,0.4464,0.4352,1.4814,2.1341,0.0006,0.188,0.0917,2.3044,0.6081,1.8959,1.6708,2.7813,2.1281,0.0117,5.7433,3.1275,1.074,1.0731,0.3769,0.7847,3.543,2.7093,0.4939,1.3332,4.2211,0.6079,2.7263,1.7809,4.3805,4.9921,0.4236,2.4915,5.0849,1.865,1.3684,0.4836,2.4753,1.9432,4.8713,0.476,1.2796,0.515,0.8172,2.7205,9.3605,0.0907,0.0015,0.6252,1.9201,2.2292,2.6488,2.0913,1.2679,1.12,2.8165,1.5913,3.1997,3.0042,1.8227,1.1145,1.0788,2.0146,0.0008,0.0072,0.0703,7.9162,0.3048,0.2449,1.8961,0.4097,1.342,6.2292,1.7432,4.0229,2.5976,2.0392,1.5176,0.0853,4.2639,3.7064,0.0026,5.6158,1.7745,5.0745,1.3705,1.4862,1.5937,4.6797,3.5895,2.0954,2.1998,0.1416,0.3072,2.4482,3.8942,5.5783,2.1978,1.4071,1.6416,5.168,4.4328,2.0471,2.9213,2.3367,5.4294,0.5745,0.0704,2.8717,0.0032,0.0321,0.0009,0.5516,0.3568,1.2724,4.1477,7.2084,1.4071,4.986,0.1182,4.6242,2.3498,0.7938,0.4011,5.7919,1.7965,5.1661,0.1147,5.4806,0.1989,3.2233,0.0,3.7056,0.4554,3.6097,2.5811,1.8938,0.0581,4.6088,1.2067,4.9424,2.6105,0.8866,0.9256,4.6797,5.1794,0.192,2.4106,4.5929,0.8154,1.483,2.4586,1.2364,5.305,3.9741,0.1313,0.254,5.6009,1.1805,0.2242,0.2543,10.9068,1.8728,0.0001,0.0005,0.0,1.5213,1.3592,0.0151,2.5623,1.9973,6.1816,0.0178,2.2741,1.8699,4.7964,2.2229,0.409,3.6104,0.0894,0.0575,4.1643,0.0243,0.0012,0.21,1.8632,1.5624,2.2403,4.149,6.7936,3.2556,0.0119,2.594,2.7427,6.6716,0.0004,0.6152,4.858,0.6879,4.7846,4.0586,0.5363,0.7464,6.4067,0.7904,0.3422,7.7848,2.0193,2.7897,4.4208,3.2705,3.5857,3.6028,2.0522,4.5232,2.268,0.4863,3.8333,0.6585,3.2581,4.5133,2.9243,5.9458,0.0001,1.1702,7.6148,0.7574,0.085,0.3802,8.1078,1.942,2.2313,2.342,0.5163,0.9552,4.0818,0.9928,4.7813,1.7474,1.9852,1.6499,6.3297,4.1351,4.0991,0.3815,2.0856,1.017,0.2651,5.2032,4.0049,2.3344,0.5082,5.9927,2.7383,3.2973,0.6529,2.3688,0.276,0.3155,1.2202,4.865,2.24,6.1752,4.7294,5.8287,10.4343,0.0633,1.5299,1.4306,1.1334,1.8981,3.1026,0.0008,0.0087,0.0015,0.0007,7.3845,5.309,5.4167,1.3281,5.8016,0.3665,0.3235]}
{"prompt":"France has stopped a large shipment of Belarus mushrooms contaminated with low-level radioactivity probably from Chernobyl and not linked to a radioactive cloud that appeared in southern Russia last month , officials said on Thursday","text":"France has stopped a large shipment of Belarus mushrooms contaminated with low-level radioactivity probably from Chernobyl and not linked to a radioactive cloud that appeared in southern Russia last month, officials said on Thursday.\nThe mushrooms, taken from the container by French and Belarusian customs officials and shipped by a Belgian firm, arrived at Calais airport on Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the French customs service told AFP on Friday.\n\"Our teams have been working for several days with their Belarusian counterpart,\" the spokeswoman said.\nThe official confirmed that they received \" three samples of fungi from the shipment and we have now been able to isolate the isotopes (of uranium)\", despite fears that it could be contaminated in some way with another contaminated cargo being sent to Kiev by a similar carrier, AMS (Aerosmes).\nWhile the cause of the contamination could not be established, authorities said it was probably from a contaminated mushroom harvested from contaminated soils near Chernobyl, where power reactors broke down in 1986-1987 and a radioactive cloud drifted over eastern Europe.\nThe shipment is the first case known of radioactivity being detected on mushrooms shipped abroad and the first to be caught in France.\nFrench customs spokesman Marc Deroche said the shipment had entered the country through the port of Dover last Friday and had now been sent back to Belgium, but an explanation had not been established yet on the origin of the contaminated material.\nFrench and Belarusian agencies will be jointly consulting on the case.\nThe mushroom samples were sent to a laboratory at Orsay on the outskirts of Paris, where they were analysed, but the cause of the contamination had not yet been established.\nA second shipment of the same mushrooms that had been taken out of a truck was reported missing by its driver at the port of Dover on May 18.\nThe truck was heading for a distribution centre in France with 300 kilograms (700 ouncs) of 'bromeliaceae mushrooms of the genus Russula', according to the customs service.\nOn Wednesday, the company that runs the distribution centre confirmed it has received the mushrooms and that they were part of another shipment to Kiev that was sent by a supplier in Belgium.\nBut the company said it would not disclose more details until the investigation was complete.\nThe truck was driven by a Belgian man and parked in a yard of a company near the port.\nA truck driver working at the same company said that about an hour and a half after arriving, he was asked to return to the truck and retrieve the shipment.\nThe French Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked for the shipment to be destroyed, but the company, which has been notified of the incident, said it would refuse to do so.\nA French company is supplying a wide variety of foods from mushrooms to baby formula.\nAccording to a notice posted on the

The decision","text":"Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori late on Sunday, triggering Christmas Eve street clashes as protesters denounced the decision as part of a crude political deal. The decision was made after Fujimori told Supreme Court justices that he would give his life and confess to more than 1,000 crimes he has said he committed, if he received a pardon. On Monday morning, the ex-president led a group of protesters who were calling for the reinstatement of Peruvian human rights organizations, including the Association of Victims of Violence and the Association of Political Prisoners, who were banned from political meetings until a court decision on October 26. But the protesters marched in and around the Supreme Court building, destroying property, leaving a trail of debris and blocking the entrance to the court building. Police were called in to disperse the crowd and the ex-president's car was broken into, but nobody in the car was injured. Protest leaders said that there was a new wave of social protest against Fujimori's pardon a week ago, and urged lawmakers to reject the deal with the ex-president. But Congress members were split over whether to reject the pardon. \"They've already declared themselves the representatives of the people and now they're going to pretend they're the voice of the people, but that's not true because people have voted for Congress. There's not that support among the population,\" Representative Juan Pari told RPP's Punto Final. \" I reject this nonsense. I don't believe any politician can say what they want to in this kind of situation,\" he continued. Peruvians returned to a peaceful night of shopping on Christmas Eve, after the Supreme Court declared lawmakers who rejected a previous pardon by Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could be punished with heavy jail terms. Thousands of supporters of the former president Alberto Fujimori gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Lima in solidarity. The crowd chanted chants urging lawmakers to reject the order, with one voice saying \"they'll pay for it.\" The Supreme Court approved on Monday a pardon for Alberto Fujimori, after the 87-year-old ex-president admitted last week to crimes including the killing of at least 25 people and attempted genocide during his ten years as president in the 1990s. The ruling lifted a three-year bar on Fujimori's presidential and parliamentary elections, and allows the 88-year-old ex-president to run for elections again. The decision came despite Fujimori's lawyer, Alejandro Aguinaga, rejecting the ruling. Aguinaga said the court had made a mockery of Peruvian justice, and that the Supreme Court had no authority to intervene in the verdict of the lower court. The opposition Nationalist Congress Party ( Per\u00fa Libre ) condemned the Supreme Court verdict, saying that it was the worst of all time, and that it was one more example of \"justice that goes contrary to the interests of the great masses.\" They also criticized Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for \"approving\" the pardon. On Christmas Day, Alberto Fujimori told Supreme Court justices that he would give his life and confess to more than 1,000 crimes he has said","token_len":645,"entropy":[11.2904,4.2832,3.5638,0.1102,0.0354,0.0132,0.0011,8.9009,0.0465,3.5848,10.0461,1.2928,4.5642,0.1124,0.0317,0.0132,6.3776,1.4253,2.3339,1.2687,5.9613,12.6358,3.6683,9.0098,6.1417,4.3394,3.3282,7.0095,0.9016,1.8378,1.871,5.3891,0.0008,0.6964,11.4781,2.4495,5.6104,0.7961,3.4198,2.7688,1.9736,2.5036,1.344,3.0181,0.0014,0.0004,5.926,7.1859,0.0258,2.5795,1.0996,0.7412,0.9169,4.8036,2.9344,3.4185,4.9121,8.9669,0.7506,7.6958,1.079,3.3207,0.0356,0.471,0.9127,3.493,2.3397,3.8958,0.9913,0.5574,2.6711,6.6846,2.0734,4.7866,1.5551,0.6256,0.3407,5.564,1.902,4.1312,0.1645,1.9254,6.4954,0.066,0.8504,6.8378,0.6699,4.0471,0.1241,1.8634,2.2497,3.5652,5.0284,0.2222,1.9031,6.7008,0.003,0.0088,7.6571,0.0214,6.3035,0.0058,6.196,1.9026,2.2466,0.9346,4.6007,0.2867,5.0316,0.0452,2.9897,2.0208,2.5411,3.7422,0.171,5.9705,2.4944,0.0035,1.7193,3.2647,1.7868,3.8973,0.3484,4.3091,2.3121,4.9172,3.4778,3.9873,3.3826,1.9769,5.6312,3.5731,0.4512,4.7693,1.4213,4.3182,6.1405,2.4605,6.2703,2.8049,0.4896,1.5055,0.0052,0.9627,0.9932,6.482,4.2603,1.7398,4.4348,2.621,2.8293,0.0374,3.9379,1.457,5.2177,1.8458,2.3173,0.3145,0.2707,1.6881,1.2557,0.4666,3.3239,3.5237,1.706,1.1808,0.5924,2.6844,0.2454,1.1427,2.1051,2.8998,5.5008,0.009,0.1746,2.6399,4.2329,0.5307,5.9016,0.3515,1.7576,2.6516,5.3523,6.2485,0.2677,2.5433,0.3619,0.8005,0.2351,6.3961,3.0875,1.6141,2.0987,4.879,0.8358,2.0597,5.7024,3.3732,0.02,5.6873,4.4349,3.2028,2.6076,0.0017,0.0005,1.3127,0.9538,7.5558,1.3612,0.7845,0.8709,1.5767,5.9501,5.6765,0.2033,3.9297,0.6959,3.0711,4.3922,0.829,4.189,0.0069,0.2234,0.6046,3.7676,7.8733,4.582,3.7118,4.5959,1.5008,0.8157,0.4314,3.5763,0.3222,2.3461,1.7363,2.4507,4.3267,4.1053,3.5111,4.6732,3.0532,2.4948,5.5913,0.0372,0.713,1.3958,2.0515,4.3303,0.6199,1.052,1.5986,0.1522,6.4116,1.3325,0.8395,1.4575,5.5104,0.0921,0.2957,0.2097,2.5241,2.849,2.9712,0.4292,0.9547,2.7549,5.752,5.0176,2.0899,3.5778,0.8062,8.3602,3.623,4.0517,0.9419,3.5285,5.5209,6.9493,3.4129,0.6141,4.5879,1.037,4.403,4.5678,7.8992,5.3718,5.3184,5.5312,7.0026,3.7281,8.762,1.2296,10.3955,1.3251,1.0371,11.5932,7.0865,1.6404,6.9168,1.5444,1.3795,2.4268,0.0005,2.3166,4.7664,4.1521,1.9698,3.4787,2.5598,1.0998,1.1014,0.6542,6.1264,2.3902,5.7477,0.0005,0.943,3.1146,0.96,3.7735,0.1478,4.4159,6.2034,0.0203,8.0975,0.4735,3.9482,3.5179,6.5954,0.7695,7.1124,2.2543,4.6599,0.2048,1.0714,4.119,1.693,1.713,0.0065,5.1975,8.3843,5.2608,5.3631,3.2991,4.4967,1.1595,5.6139,4.1349,0.0136,0.2272,3.0126,0.0359,0.0017,0.0014,0.0005,5.3106,1.6563,3.5156,1.4639,7.8092,3.3074,1.0169,0.5303,5.3455,0.4638,4.7473,1.267,1.0682,2.2782,0.9384,16.2538,0.0088,0.0013,0.0007,2.2725,1.5681,0.3009,0.444,0.0044,0.8287,1.9732,2.5443,3.576,3.892,3.4242,2.104,3.853,1.568,6.7057,6.1382,2.5486,0.192,0.6765,0.3166,7.1027,2.0134,3.9144,2.237,4.406,0.9793,1.9061,4.7833,3.2487,4.4253,1.2596,1.2558,1.1312,2.0024,2.4198,0.007,5.025,5.8847,2.3042,0.9758,2.559,1.5245,4.4474,0.003,0.0007,0.001,0.6961,3.772,1.7689,9.8697,0.036,0.0034,0.014,0.0014,3.5547,0.01,0.4123,4.7116,5.7182,0.7415,1.3867,2.8196,3.2801,3.8572,2.0056,0.0339,3.688,0.0003,4.2534,0.9327,2.1862,5.4464,5.0712,3.9638,1.578,6.7836,2.4457,1.527,0.3445,4.0974,2.0147,2.1309,0.0106,0.132,1.5014,2.5413,6.9669,1.4505,3.756,0.0133,0.5951,7.4383,0.3366,4.5225,0.0011,0.0011,0.2316,4.5975,6.3187,1.5352,3.8007,1.2486,1.9087,6.4808,2.6118,10.5068,0.0246,0.0016,0.0037,0.0012,4.5295,0.0066,0.0901,0.1995,1.013,0.4116,5.6566,2.0624,1.5317,1.6816,3.3038,3.0248,4.5888,3.7488,0.0011,0.0009,0.2266,5.4074,1.7993,5.7389,0.1374,5.9012,5.7514,3.6837,0.2168,6.7539,0.6749,3.6412,1.4718,3.5236,0.003,0.0013,0.9683,1.744,2.6193,2.0878,4.2452,1.2451,5.3627,0.0109,3.1789,0.0051,4.174,1.7154,0.9389,1.5645,1.2638,3.0529,0.0037,1.481,3.4653,2.0583,0.1498,4.644,0.9269,1.4826,7.859,3.7611,0.941,5.3944,0.4858,0.4393,2.1425,5.6855,3.8154,4.7259,2.0381,1.2011,1.062,13.8074,2.8896,9.8013,0.7943,4.0716,0.1969,2.7584,0.0013,5.1022,0.8927,1.1259,1.9187,1.0168,1.3688,3.0652,4.9615,2.8102,3.7324,4.0073,2.3423,0.7999,1.3571,1.138,1.4635,5.3957,2.6902,1.5826,0.0708,3.2659,5.2208,3.4228,5.3253,5.8774,0.02,0.761,5.4354,0.0479,0.5401,7.2124,4.7283,1.2716,4.8133,0.8248,1.9597,4.4096,0.0138,1.2958,3.0818,0.0782,0.0029,0.0016,0.0012,0.7944,3.833,6.7926,3.3109,1.6404,1.0785,0.7969,1.3835,4.7478,5.306,1.9665,0.1418,8.852,0.0097,0.0007,0.0009,3.7163,6.4835,0.0064,0.7028,0.5152,0.1043,0.3087,0.8239,0.0289,0.0067,0.3374,0.1042,0.0044,0.1802,0.0009,0.0095,0.0003,0.0014,0.0228,0.0117,0.0286,0.0162]}
{"prompt":"Lawmakers of Germany s Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives , have nominated state finance minister Markus Soeder as candidate for state premier in","text":"Lawmakers of Germany s Christian Social Union ( CSU ), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, have nominated state finance minister Markus Soeder as candidate for state premier in the next federal election, the party's media chief Alexander Dobrindt said on Thursday.Mr Dobrindt said his party had not yet selected Mr Soeder to replace Gerhard Schroeder, who is stepping down as CDU Chancellor.\"We are talking and thinking about it, but at the moment we have no decision yet, \" he said, when asked whether Mr Soeder would become an alternative to Mr Schroeder.A CSU spokesman, Thorsten Liebig, said his party was in \" talks about\" who would be a suitable candidate for the post.The Bavarian public broadcaster ARD and TV2 reported that Mr Soeder, who leads the CSU's Bavarian party, was among the options.The Bavarian state has a population of about 10 million, so it is a pivotal political centre.Germany's elections to the Bundestag are due in October 2011.Mr Dobrindt said that Mr Soeder was in line with what the ruling coalition in the Bavarian state, which includes the CDU, called for if that party was to remain a key partner in the governing coalition of Chancellor Merkel.\"It is hard to imagine that someone from the CDU could stand up in front of the population of the German state and say'I am going to keep the economy growing'but as a side effect do almost nothing against unemployment,\" Mr Dobrindt said.He declined to name the possible substitute party members of the Bavarian government's coalition partner could be in the event that the CDU backs out of the coalition.The CSU's media chief said his party's decision to nominate Mr Soeder was not linked to plans for the CDU's Bavarian leader, Wolfgang Miesch, to challenge Mr Soeder.In March, the CDU and the moderate-leaning Free Democrats ( FDP ) formed a government in Bavaria with Mr Soeder as finance minister, along with two coalition partners.However, the CDU-FDP coalition now has been rocked with a series of scandal cases following a high-profile investigation by Bavarian police and prosecutors which linked it to a bribery scandal.The parties announced in May that they would try to unwind the coalition.Both Mr Soeder and Miesch were caught up in the scandal.The CDU-FDP coalition split last year and Mr Soeder has been a spokesman for the former coalition partners.In the coming weeks the FDP will have to come to an agreement with the center-left SPD and the liberal Open Liberals ( FDP ) on which candidate to have in the next state election, but the SPD has refused to hand over their position in the coalition to the FDP, saying it was a central part of a government agreement made in 2009.German Prime

It seems that you had to come here first\u2019\u201d Pope Francis said in his homily during the Mass with which he began his pilgrimage.\n\u201cWe are a continent of mission. The Lord does not care about those who understand the mission,\u201d said the 68-year-old Pontiff, explaining to the crowd of about a million people gathered on the campus of St Joseph\u2019s Seminary in Lagos to witness the ordination of five new priests and several deacons.\n\u201cThe Lord does not care about those who have a great knowledge of the spirituality of the mission,\u201d he added, describing himself as a \u201cpeople of spiritual and physical fatigue.\u201d\nWhen he arrived in Africa, Pope Francis noted, he felt a missionary urgency. \u201cThat feeling still stays there, in the bones. It doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said.\nThe pope was speaking at the opening of a two-day meeting of bishops of Africa at St Joseph\u2019s Seminary in Lagos where three bishops from Africa have been ordained as his secretaries, as part of his longstanding support for the formation of Catholic priests there.\nIn Nigeria, Pope Francis is celebrating Mass at a refugee camp in northern Nigeria where many of the world\u2019s Muslim Rohingya have set up tents \u2013 a symbolic gesture intended to show \u201clove, peace and respect\u201d to the refugees and their traditions. He is also visiting another refugee camp in the town of Dapchi in northern Nigeria to meet Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who have fled the persecution.\nThe Pope is expected to fly to northern Nigeria today to welcome some 100,000 Rohingya refugees seeking refuge from military violence in Myanmar. He has promised the people of Myanmar he will come to see them again.\n\u201cMany of us Christians live in a world where we don\u2019t have the strength to look up or even speak,\u201d Pope Francis said in his homily at the diocesan seminary in Lagos. He continued, \u201cBut Jesus is with us everywhere. That is why we can still do missions.\u201d\nDuring his last trip to Africa, Pope Francis told his fellow bishops that the continent needs to become a place where \u201cthe Gospel is shared daily with the people\u201d and that no \u201cone country, no matter how large, is enough for the Catholic Church on the continent.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s ordination of five new priests, including two from Pakistan, as well as several deacons, is a small step towards reviving efforts in Africa to replenish the priesthood.\nIn a separate ceremony held last week, a seminary in Sierra Leone received its first Catholic priests and deacons.

It carried a payload that weighed about 500 pounds. North Korea said on Monday that the rocket carried a hydrogen bomb that could be turned \"into a nuclear bomb the moment it is pulled out of the launcher,\" the ruling Workers News Agency reported.The missile launch also raised concerns over North Korea s nuclear and missile program.The White House previously said a potential strike against North Korea would be a response to any action that violates the agreement.It said that the North Korean regime must stop its nuclear and missile programs and allow inspections on its weapons facilities.It added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he could take any necessary measures to defend the regime against an attack.\"Whether we were talking in private, or in public... he was saying he had a strong resolve on this, and it would be carried through,\" White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said Tuesday in an interview with ABC.\"Right now, I don't think we know what that means.\" In addition, Kim stated Tuesday that he wanted to see a \"new beginning\" with the United States, with the South and China, while condemning its policy as \"miserably hostile\" to his people.\"It s the arrogant attitude of bullying and hostile provocation to the DPRK (North Korea), it is time for North Koreans to change this attitude,\" Kim said.Asked under what conditions he plans to meet with the US president when he arrives and how long such a meeting would last, he said: \"To make a judgment, I can t at this point. But I can say that if this is our good wish, it will definitely take place.\"Last month, the Kim met with President Trump, leading to an easing of tensions that had escalated sharply since then., a former official, said Tuesday that Kim and the Trump administration seem to have started negotiating in the area of U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises, which Trump has called threats to North Korea's security by South Korea. The official said the talks could last an hour to an hour and a half between Kim and the acting US defence secretary, Patrick Shanahan.","token_len":646,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,10.1731,5.2705,0.0686,10.8366,9.5786,4.1846,1.2088,1.9429,8.6333,1.3505,0.5241,7.7355,3.3459,0.2057,0.218,0.0008,5.6626,3.5769,4.6211,2.1312,2.3041,3.6847,2.3735,2.6678,3.2612,6.5305,1.3118,1.6196,0.0006,0.0061,0.0272,4.3981,5.3633,1.2645,4.2205,3.7913,1.3062,3.7526,1.3563,5.6396,6.8575,3.5421,1.245,3.6296,3.1065,0.0115,5.051,0.8343,6.7882,2.0229,8.0374,0.3495,0.0505,1.8876,0.6942,3.9052,0.5704,1.7706,0.1187,7.0635,0.3197,0.7682,3.1933,2.1735,1.6462,0.092,0.0032,2.1418,1.7088,3.64,1.8265,0.8495,0.0007,0.6681,4.2362,1.4667,7.1113,5.1662,0.4018,3.4333,3.0221,7.1138,0.7607,4.0692,3.2878,0.7727,1.1432,1.5233,1.4233,6.9058,1.9821,2.8181,3.3744,5.143,1.8605,2.2203,7.1428,3.2052,5.7882,0.0217,7.9486,1.2234,6.2246,1.9275,7.6441,1.1906,1.8995,8.2884,0.0337,3.5968,0.0939,13.9149,4.4395,7.6876,4.2541,3.7848,4.1625,0.312,5.1738,1.1953,0.1507,1.9606,1.0637,5.4067,0.1858,0.4937,0.2333,0.1692,3.3276,0.3624,0.1531,3.1923,1.4704,3.737,5.1213,3.8036,6.0486,1.3119,5.483,1.2024,5.1622,0.0051,0.9961,5.8914,1.374,5.9313,6.2906,5.5905,7.3725,1.842,5.694,5.1876,3.13,1.1403,1.2655,2.9784,3.6666,2.6311,0.0016,0.0004,0.1196,2.8372,1.9464,3.6112,6.8077,4.9273,3.9676,0.0007,7.137,1.6258,7.664,4.1284,4.7206,4.1081,4.9042,1.5091,2.9739,3.1837,0.9408,6.6806,0.2525,0.0824,0.7966,4.6761,3.8518,1.2333,1.7364,0.0112,4.9697,0.0419,0.1945,0.0326,0.9844,1.8908,7.219,0.0976,3.2446,1.005,5.3372,1.2617,3.7284,1.173,0.5803,0.815,0.0176,7.1563,2.5489,1.1013,3.7498,2.7595,2.5537,0.3667,1.5245,1.127,2.1181,0.8179,0.9533,2.9256,1.4848,1.494,2.2206,5.4421,3.3614,1.1694,0.5577,0.9547,2.4435,5.6987,0.4614,2.4166,3.1089,3.935,0.9911,3.9593,1.1074,1.288,3.9295,0.1026,2.5585,4.435,2.1643,1.4931,1.9127,2.1609,4.0836,0.8229,3.1863,0.2593,1.8921,0.7656,1.1347,4.8202,7.6307,0.6681,0.4883,0.6667,2.3755,7.7263,2.7048,0.3593,2.2472,5.9481,1.6661,0.4271,0.2994,9.4026,1.5703,2.1767,8.0129,2.3091,11.3062,0.0217,0.7446,0.2792,1.3244,2.8459,4.2217,3.9825,3.7242,1.8352,2.0259,2.5922,0.079,3.4366,3.0999,2.0383,0.3624,1.5658,1.2932,2.963,5.0246,0.0007,6.4549,0.7764,4.0336,6.0196,2.9692,1.989,1.2828,0.0139,1.6592,0.9474,2.3642,4.6942,0.0735,4.14,4.6376,3.4301,5.2129,1.3444,5.3863,2.0143,4.3379,1.9768,2.3665,1.7309,3.4276,1.5899,2.3429,4.8296,2.9493,1.282,1.2033,0.7207,0.1646,0.7215,1.323,4.7786,5.0411,4.1869,1.006,4.1632,2.5424,0.9768,3.2776,3.1495,0.1942,2.684,2.9377,1.8138,0.0141,0.0479,0.327,3.951,2.3823,3.6681,4.154,3.8589,5.1506,1.4809,0.4877,4.4157,1.59,5.1585,1.9333,3.6702,0.1925,3.1363,6.1413,2.3296,5.3281,3.6166,5.6887,6.2475,2.2892,1.1719,1.3885,0.8558,6.621,5.5887,3.4986,2.0902,2.527,3.4785,2.3877,4.9321,4.1151,3.6089,1.2453,2.7461,0.9316,3.3456,2.3589,0.4964,7.051,5.3017,2.2993,2.3467,0.0022,5.0193,0.0036,0.0994,8.4411,7.9382,0.4457,4.9737,0.5788,2.7078,2.5789,1.1905,0.0866,0.6513,2.6205,5.0879,6.468,0.0301,0.7351,2.9438,1.8674,0.0143,0.6893,1.8455,4.5964,1.1011,3.3668,0.7826,2.8168,7.5966,3.2558,0.6667,5.3912,6.3763,5.4549,0.3544,1.189,4.5621,0.5483,3.1624,2.1884,1.7518,3.1361,2.8223,0.3912,2.3153,0.9321,1.8896,0.2199,1.482,4.6749,1.3489,4.5606,1.8292,1.6862,2.3619,4.0239,5.5269,5.581,5.155,6.5575,1.1965,5.9374,2.3035,2.4407,5.789,1.6679,0.4612,3.2896,2.5867,1.253,2.9018,9.3647,2.9634,7.6402,3.0667,0.4036,6.4403,0.6846,0.7959,0.1039,0.9499,0.2246,0.0244,5.5643,0.4858,0.067,2.1342,4.6992,1.7629,5.4296,0.9647,4.1917,4.9803,0.1561,4.3024,4.4737,1.6503,1.1457,0.938,0.3649,0.9364,5.3941,8.2629,0.2899,0.8701,2.4476,5.2466,0.0286,4.8843,0.516,1.4652,3.4952,2.4487,5.5019,0.5148,3.4682,6.7806,3.1903,1.7991,5.6018,0.7999,0.2492,1.7477,3.1327,0.0638,1.9997,0.4,1.7042,0.059,5.5552,3.3309,2.2076,5.7807,1.9106,1.1949,3.0839,8.2271,5.1259,2.4226,0.8926,1.6021,1.7236,1.1172,1.7052,2.1806,1.1135,3.3677,3.6257,1.5444,4.912,8.4466,7.2586,0.3905,2.2779,1.4782,5.361,3.1245,0.3041,1.2999,5.0936,1.2557,0.1436,1.5708,6.5042,6.3703,0.3232,2.7752,2.8173,1.7799,6.8447,0.5293,3.5056,5.8142,0.0403,0.6828,3.2537,3.2052,4.9299,3.6015,2.3284,3.2454,8.7369,3.8376,6.2754,3.7255,5.0738,1.7937,1.9639,1.0471,3.2405,3.7805,1.7708,2.5977,0.2999,6.639,0.3988,1.0306,5.9688,6.0494,3.319,2.354,7.1827,0.1975,4.4719,0.0015,0.1523,0.6704,1.0014,0.8335,2.9684,0.6549,0.3236,1.8367,1.928,5.1731,1.2142,1.8988,9.3697,0.2935,2.3877,0.0598,1.0396,2.2195,6.6017,4.6595,0.2739,1.033,2.9629,1.3085,0.6344,1.3519,2.4602,3.2744,1.7617,5.1164,1.1937,3.1309,1.7541,0.0023,1.9009,1.7208,0.0039,5.9813,3.547,0.0893,1.0264,9.641,2.402,7.3118,0.0246,0.5162,9.9,3.5535,0.9798]}
{"prompt":"Colombia s lower house of congress late on Monday backed a bill to regulate transitional justice under the nation s peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels , including special tribunals that will try guerrilla leaders","text":"Colombia s lower house of congress late on Monday backed a bill to regulate transitional justice under the nation s peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels, including special tribunals that will try guerrilla leaders and civilian opponents of the rebels. Some activists and critics of the agreement have raised concerns that it may allow impunity for guerrillas, and some fear a return to standoffs in Colombia. The bill will now go to President Juan Manuel Santos, who has said he wants to implement a version of it before the end of his term in 2018.\nThe law also includes safeguards for victim assistance and transitional justice judges. \"That it includes a mechanism to provide transitional justice that includes victim compensation is very positive and I think this should continue,\" said Sen. Richard Aguilar, a vice president-elect of Colombia s opposition liberal party who helped draft the legislation. On Monday, Sen. Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has been critical of the proposed transitional justice strategy, backed the bill.\n\"I think that the bill provides a very good way to ensure that justice is done,\" he said.\nFormer President Alvaro Uribe, a staunch opponent of the accord and a powerful political figure in the opposition, urged Santos to approve the bill as soon as possible.\n\"I believe that Mr Santos should act immediately by adopting this bill in the Congress. This is his chance to be remembered as the guy who doesn t forget, not as the guy who forgets,\" said Uribe, who has been an influential political figure in Latin America and the world. \"Now it is absolutely necessary for him to see if the bill is strong enough to go forward at this moment in the war and whether justice is able to go ahead.\"\nIn a message of support to Uribe posted on his website, Santos wrote that he would implement the legislation. \" I will continue to fight with all my abilities to secure peace in Colombia,\" he said. The Senate's approval of the bill puts pressure on President Uribe to reject it and seek consensus instead.\nMany of both sides of the deal expressed dissatisfaction with the content of the bill that senators approved earlier this month in another legislative session. This week, they will go ahead with the law, knowing it will not gain a majority approval, but that the government has indicated that it will enact it, an effort widely viewed as a way for President Santos to demonstrate his government s commitment to implementing the accord.\nThe debate over transitional justice has continued in Colombia s Congress, where two independent commissions report on the proposed legislation. The government commission says it intends to draft its report in April, but independent commission chairman Andres Felipe Arias has repeatedly said that such a report ought not be seen as a definitive report, pointing to inconsistencies in the proposed legislation. In a letter to the commission, a group of law makers wrote that the proposed bill is not adequate and recommended that it be improved and refined.\nColombia s peace deal with the rebels, signed in November, was agreed after more than four years of fighting. Under the agreement, the rebels will surrender their weapons, rejoin the formal democratic framework, and participate in a process of peace, reconciliation, and reintegration.","token_len":646,"entropy":[9.0624,0.5846,9.6467,11.5644,1.3493,0.5279,4.349,8.4556,2.385,2.4448,7.1985,1.73,1.7145,1.5835,5.5455,12.6773,3.4648,5.5574,0.8327,5.4966,8.2437,7.599,3.7231,1.1932,6.6042,8.7549,0.2192,0.6844,1.9299,4.3205,8.1589,4.7434,0.0123,0.0001,3.1081,2.7037,3.8865,8.6191,1.2243,2.3384,6.8116,4.5861,1.3582,0.5545,5.1829,0.5029,7.8673,5.9082,2.4641,5.3822,1.6122,0.3123,4.5471,1.6759,4.267,0.8947,0.6598,1.8874,2.9799,3.4079,4.9676,0.464,3.5941,0.0578,0.0001,2.6554,3.0294,4.3529,4.6581,2.883,2.7731,0.0732,10.9166,3.9162,2.8345,3.9961,1.368,2.5291,2.6299,2.9907,3.3107,0.9663,0.331,3.0756,1.1224,0.0549,0.0003,1.0597,0.4468,1.0301,2.0077,0.5498,2.0954,0.6207,4.4616,2.29,5.6448,0.0843,4.0055,3.6841,1.4666,0.5362,0.001,2.6492,0.3351,1.0757,2.2216,0.1603,1.0633,10.2508,4.8067,3.9304,3.231,5.8124,0.9263,8.0062,5.8955,1.5742,5.3145,0.1694,6.005,1.1971,3.6638,5.819,5.8119,5.17,2.2796,3.2325,1.4121,3.5511,3.894,0.1076,5.251,4.8856,4.6676,4.8072,2.4579,2.433,3.1818,2.3654,2.7786,0.9255,3.3414,3.8269,4.7142,1.0484,0.6715,5.4191,0.1596,5.7152,6.0908,0.4943,0.4074,0.9257,5.0611,0.7144,6.5471,0.1133,0.4593,3.7069,6.7406,2.5926,9.0256,2.0942,4.8823,4.0835,0.9813,0.0944,2.1428,0.1762,6.8073,0.7501,0.2746,4.4983,0.0247,3.1206,3.8494,4.607,0.2645,1.552,2.3357,2.5157,1.4079,3.4139,0.0124,0.2621,5.1156,4.6467,0.1095,6.9994,0.3135,5.3252,0.9454,0.7334,0.799,1.4178,2.0098,1.7497,1.1352,2.2315,1.7539,2.9939,4.1538,1.355,2.515,0.931,3.738,0.8344,3.0861,0.516,3.1867,0.8857,1.591,2.0964,0.8568,0.2971,0.4997,1.604,6.2771,1.5377,5.164,0.0784,0.0006,0.437,0.0034,1.0022,2.0719,3.5092,2.311,0.0137,0.5839,4.7077,2.6234,1.2507,6.2647,3.6761,1.9124,1.8587,1.1353,3.7037,0.4239,5.064,1.9916,0.2757,4.2477,0.2929,0.4869,3.548,1.4051,0.0026,0.0648,0.474,1.3453,0.6652,1.6106,2.6605,0.6464,6.3498,4.5514,1.4235,4.6538,1.6793,5.8565,4.6837,1.6411,1.3848,3.6199,1.5148,5.7435,2.7835,2.9366,1.1849,5.6378,3.152,0.245,4.6036,4.1529,1.2736,1.6001,4.5,0.1762,8.2126,6.2862,5.6155,3.7971,3.97,4.2358,0.683,0.6362,0.0661,3.7348,0.089,0.9067,1.406,0.6117,0.0013,0.3401,0.5242,2.0694,1.5997,3.4564,3.3698,4.2069,0.6008,0.372,3.8989,0.0244,2.3773,1.8235,2.691,0.8525,1.4816,4.9685,3.1147,0.7296,8.9131,1.9392,1.2951,0.9859,0.1054,5.1522,3.3315,2.2139,2.3143,1.3307,5.7385,0.0228,0.6515,3.6577,1.4911,5.6055,1.6285,2.1876,2.2925,4.3681,6.0353,2.8251,5.4829,7.6133,1.2421,6.8328,0.0187,4.4138,3.0928,1.2946,0.4171,3.4418,1.3827,5.2543,6.3654,0.6885,1.5955,3.5527,0.0084,8.7446,0.2897,1.194,2.4985,0.8187,2.0355,4.0639,1.3363,1.2212,2.3751,6.1649,0.3937,2.1349,3.4528,1.3245,8.2319,2.4697,2.734,0.3673,2.262,3.6611,1.3732,0.481,5.9913,1.3284,5.4568,1.8889,2.1182,0.7626,1.5382,0.3127,0.988,0.2488,3.74,3.6849,3.3477,4.6737,0.8069,0.1112,0.4756,6.093,3.9669,0.0174,3.2932,4.525,0.0067,0.6494,5.5603,2.1062,2.3721,5.3286,5.9898,7.0028,0.8402,0.8448,5.4764,2.5879,8.6805,2.7068,1.6382,0.061,7.1235,5.0733,5.2182,0.4559,0.3757,6.9453,0.2033,0.1306,1.193,4.4922,7.6828,4.2207,3.2721,0.348,0.8123,3.9582,7.1301,5.5424,0.4978,0.485,6.3032,3.3176,0.3393,5.1843,5.5245,4.6772,4.6023,0.3983,2.2371,4.8419,2.0624,7.3696,1.7476,0.4926,2.4338,4.9637,3.3231,1.7538,6.4656,3.3351,2.4964,3.8695,2.1819,2.8185,3.0393,4.8611,1.6919,0.3493,0.7692,6.885,1.1161,3.3206,5.334,3.3121,6.519,3.5268,0.0944,1.1081,4.0853,2.6811,3.794,0.561,0.0911,4.5189,1.0466,4.7178,5.3072,3.2232,0.0595,5.8991,0.7951,3.8018,0.2318,0.6297,1.8446,5.888,0.6127,2.9267,0.008,1.3999,4.26,1.8696,1.6093,1.905,3.493,1.3561,0.7188,4.8831,5.0419,1.7419,5.3727,1.3889,0.8555,5.5845,1.6867,1.0283,1.4214,3.3745,8.6383,5.2636,1.2045,4.5112,0.0228,4.2808,3.6293,0.8269,1.8013,4.0332,1.1038,1.037,7.2035,3.5848,3.0902,4.7264,0.4899,7.2361,0.5451,6.8734,0.0959,2.3807,4.7745,1.2774,1.0072,4.6548,0.5848,1.7952,6.9644,0.9651,0.1924,5.4135,0.0783,0.8275,3.9087,2.921,1.803,5.816,0.5138,4.7748,0.5284,0.6905,6.2367,1.052,0.6107,3.6939,1.5381,2.1929,0.4785,1.4733,2.3203,1.0146,4.7427,5.3145,0.1737,6.4137,5.2484,2.3824,0.3219,0.9842,3.2276,2.2741,2.7749,2.2794,6.0767,2.2136,5.7868,0.9951,1.4512,0.6314,6.5936,3.4168,5.1512,0.5222,0.8697,5.6382,0.0034,0.5479,0.9611,1.9567,0.9252,1.0178,2.2638,2.6282,2.2192,7.1147,0.8017,4.2344,2.3019,2.2714,4.5103,3.6924,2.4715,0.003,2.8583,0.5232,0.156,1.9692,1.6193,6.0076,0.5525,1.6903,0.1235,1.4713,1.4287,2.9465,6.32,2.104,1.2388,1.4996,7.487,2.5932,0.7609,8.9981,6.3221,7.1026,1.5224,0.2942,5.5357,0.0958,2.0779,3.9138,0.7951,3.1976,3.8287,2.7767,0.584,0.2006,3.9433,0.4463,0.0033,0.8244]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. Senate on Monday voted to confirm President Donald Trump \u2019 s nomination of Callista Gingrich to be the U.S . Ambassador to the Vatican . Gingrich , 51 , an author , documentary","text":"The U.S. Senate on Monday voted to confirm President Donald Trump \u2019 s nomination of Callista Gingrich to be the U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican. Gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker, and former Republican Congresswoman, replaces John Kirby, who resigned in early November, after Trump announced that he and his administration would no longer recognize the Holocaust. Senators, who unanimously voted on Monday night to confirm her, said Gingrich has an outstanding record of diplomatic experience, while also calling her the leader of a \u201d coalition of faith leaders and religious leaders, with the experience of being the first female ambassador to the Vatican for four years and being appointed to the United States embassy to the Holy See in 2013 at a critical time. \u201d She had the opportunity to take the place of the Ambassador John Kirby, whose resignation shocked the world and the Vatican. \u201cWe are incredibly proud of Callista Gingrich, and the fact that she is so uniquely qualified for the position,\u201d said Republican senator Bill Weld.\nIn his first day of Senate confirmation hearings, Trump\u2019s nomination of Callista Gingrich as Ambassador of the United States to the Vatican ended by requesting that she be removed from the Department of State as soon as possible.\nGingrich was a strong voice for her conservative Jewish colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee. And on March 11, in the wake of the attacks in Nice, France, as she criticized the French government\u2019s treatment of French-Jewish communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time, I think, for the White House to stand up to President Macron \u2026 and tell him he needs to do more,\u201d said Gingrich in a letter to the President of France signed by other conservative Jewish Senators.\nThe State Department later announced that it will send a senior official to the Vatican to speak to Pope Francis, who has repeatedly condemned antisemitism.\nAccording to the Vatican\u2019s own website, Gingrich is an expert on the Church\u2019s role as a missionary force in its global presence, particularly at the local and international levels.\nGingrich, a frequent speaker at conservative congregations and groups, and a former Congresswoman, is a political activist and author. A Democrat in 2008, she joined the Republican Party in 2014 and became a registered Republic in 2016 after having the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire.\nDuring her presidential campaign, Trump promised to remove the Vatican envoy after he was appointed. He said that the Vatican envoy \u201d has been complicit in the anti-American, antisemitic activities of the current Pope. \u201cI said it to him,\u201d the president announced at the time. The new president also said that the State Department would be represented by a senior official in the Vatican.\nIn his opening day of political testimony, Gingrich expressed his belief that the Trump

General Michael H. Flynn, provides a more upbeat assessment of China than Trump's April 2017 one. The Trump strategy focused on Beijing's aggression in the South China Sea; military threats to the U. The 2017 National Intelligence Report (NIR) was submitted under the aegis of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, to President Trump in July 2017. It was authored by James Clapper, Daniel Coats, Michael Flynn and David Schenin, who are retiring.\nIt was also authored by three people: Susan M. Rice. The 2017 National Security Strategy - a document intended for the public - is the first of its kind ever to be published under President Donald Trump. It offers a much more pointed assessment of the national security threats posed by China than was found in the most recent presidential strategy, which focused principally on alleged U. In other words, all five major agencies.\nPresident Trump's national security strategy will be unveiled on Monday and is expected to place China on the back burner in favor of issues that prioritize U.

His new report, issued Wednesday, is the first of its kind ever to be issued under Trump\u2019s presidency.\nIt provides a more pointed assessment of China\u2019s influence globally than the president\u2019s previous strategy, issuing a call for a redefi ning of China\u2019s strategic status in American foreign policy.\nI am very pleased that U. The 2020 National Security Strategy is the first of its kind to be issued under the administration of President Trump and represents significant evolution over prior frameworks. It will take place in Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union, where NATO ministers plan a three-day meeting to discuss.\nThe National Security Strategy is a policy statement that outlines a national security approach for the administration.

At a...\nKaiyara is passionate about empowering people to live a life of true joy and happiness regardless of their circumstances in life. With over 15 years of experience as a psychotherapeutic intuitive, Kaiyara specializes in the treatment of anxiety and relationship issues. Kaiyara has been involved in numerous healing and spiritual circles over the last years and has worked with many different types of healing practitioners to enhance her knowledge and techniques. Kaiyara\u2019s goal is to guide individuals through difficult times and share the light she carries within to create more loving and vibrant lives. With a compassionate, intuitive and easy going style of communication, Kaiyara helps to put people at ease. A great way to start the conversation is to ask Kaiyara about an upcoming spiritual healing circle or book signing.\nOne client was so impressed with his healing with Kaiyara, that he recommended his sister who suffers from fibromyalgia, have her fibromyalgia go away. She called me and said that Kaiyara had changed her view on her life. I also believe that in each of us is the power to feel amazing, happy and joyful in our life\u2019s. Kaiyara can help you get to feel great again.\nWe offer the only in person spiritual healing circles in the area as well as on-line sessions. Each healing circle is designed for you, depending on how you\u2019d like to receive healing. We do have an entire circle guide if you\u2019d like to take the path of spirituality, but the way to receive healing is through the healing process.\nThis healing circle is led by Kaiyara, who will guide you through the healing process with simple and effective techniques. We meet at 1:30PM EST at the healing circle.\nThis healing circle does not have a specific time and location. You will receive the healing circle by phone and video conference.\nThis healing circle involves a guided meditation called Heart Chakra Healing which I facilitate and then we open the hearts to receive healing. This circle is for anyone who wants to receive healing but have no idea where to begin, or if they are seeking a way to begin to receive healing.\nWe will receive healing through prayer, meditation, energy work and intuition. I will help you to activate your own healing system through your intuition and then we move into a guided meditation called Heart Chakra Healing. The time is up at 9:20 so that we can have private healing through the Heart Chakra channeling.

A global stimulus package is possible, but it does not necessarily mean the economy will be better, say...\nThe world was expecting a bigger recovery, but the U.S. economy is now showing signs of stagnation, as the Federal Reserve takes more cautious approaches to keeping the economy running. The economy is not growing at the same rate as it was a few years ago, though...\nThe pandemic is shaking up everything. The economy is no exception. Despite a surge in interest on U.S. Treasury yields, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (SP500) is close to a six-year record high.

It\u2019s time to see if this is a political campaign gone awry or if the real truth is that the U.S. attorney is doing exactly what he said he was going to do.\nAnd on what basis are these sex crimes prosecuted in the first place?

John Thune of South Dakota \u2026\nIn the week before July\u2019s election, there were a lot of words written about \u201cchange\u201d that seemed to indicate that it was necessary \u2013 and that we\u2019d be waiting years for the \u201cend of the change\u201d.

One of God\u2019s angels stood behind him, holding a spear, trying to hit him in the behind when Christ was killed, but instead Christ\u2019s blood smeared the spear, covering St. George\u2019s back as he fell to his death.\nAlthough I have yet to hear this story from my parents about when I was growing up or from my grandparents, the story can be traced back to a very long time ago.\nIn fact, there were two St. Georges \u2013 the St. George we know today, and a brother who was martyred before him.\n\u201cThere was another, also a saint, who used to wander about the fields with his horse and donkey. He was a very poor man, but he served God well and he kept his body well fed and clothed. He lived in a cave which was very dark and was far away from village. On a dark and snowy night, the saint was riding his horse and his donkey in search of food and water. On the way he came to a village and went to some house to ask for food and water. In the house there was a man who asked him if he wanted to borrow some money. The saint did not want to take it, so the man insisted very much, but Saint George did not want to lend anyone money.\nSo the man went to the village schoolmaster and begged for help. And the priest was a very cruel man, and the gentleman who owned the house didn\u2019t like Saint George to be poor; so he threw him out of the house. Saint George was very sad and very angry because he had no longer money to go home. He set out to the village. He saw three men walking and talking with each other. They asked Saint George to ride with them to a big farm where they were staying.","token_len":648,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,6.6272,3.2978,10.143,0.1198,6.9395,0.0164,0.0156,0.3081,5.3008,1.489,3.8018,1.8979,3.0346,2.0321,0.4807,1.5935,3.7776,1.7869,8.0166,2.1597,5.2802,2.9707,3.3763,1.4318,0.2231,3.6969,2.0432,4.3819,7.2425,4.4923,1.5803,9.1895,1.0039,0.3226,0.6235,0.0942,0.6174,7.707,0.1338,2.4181,2.3247,0.0,2.6379,0.0154,0.0096,10.8182,4.2432,13.0749,2.7588,5.2385,2.1182,7.7303,19.6726,8.154,3.9856,2.9016,0.0918,4.6854,1.4064,3.5878,3.262,0.027,7.8739,5.438,0.5841,11.6969,5.6159,9.7545,0.2321,6.9492,3.8092,3.8706,0.7295,3.6137,1.2872,3.4676,0.7903,6.354,7.7358,1.8934,1.8421,3.7711,7.1507,6.0849,3.4797,2.4503,4.9,7.6547,1.3353,1.8245,7.8401,0.8272,5.6127,0.68,0.9189,6.1803,0.495,1.9719,1.3319,3.6325,3.9012,9.8479,2.4126,4.8502,3.1093,0.4414,2.0781,5.5419,1.061,0.9456,5.2765,0.8743,0.7098,9.3586,4.3447,2.3003,0.4666,7.1839,5.0107,1.5106,7.3474,0.1958,4.3976,3.878,5.1723,4.9776,1.5994,1.3286,5.2959,6.2408,6.1668,2.5397,0.2962,0.5506,4.8021,0.002,0.0052,0.0285,5.0717,0.1549,5.1342,1.5556,0.3636,5.0236,3.6582,0.7568,5.2068,0.3507,7.7666,8.0875,2.3518,3.952,4.6207,3.843,3.1151,2.9801,2.0859,8.0938,0.3908,1.9233,1.9203,2.8402,0.2405,5.7927,3.0227,4.5873,0.0267,1.1783,5.6079,9.8254,0.1689,4.4473,2.7937,8.4706,0.7805,1.6695,7.6624,1.2348,1.7535,10.9753,0.2866,4.3328,0.0607,5.9413,3.3748,8.604,1.2875,2.221,3.8125,3.6459,6.1182,3.1702,5.5267,2.9604,0.7416,1.7851,0.059,1.6443,4.1257,0.0261,0.2024,1.3174,2.499,4.5779,0.0718,0.0784,9.8981,1.7244,2.0618,5.3801,4.4201,2.7156,4.9321,0.0363,1.9744,3.1281,6.1962,0.6322,1.2298,3.0724,0.0256,0.1666,1.9765,6.085,2.2467,0.2552,0.7414,2.5487,0.0325,0.03,5.0345,2.0722,2.3498,3.8375,7.273,1.2305,10.4253,0.0996,6.308,5.144,0.8571,13.803,4.5119,0.0018,0.0018,2.4306,2.0993,2.9532,9.0778,3.1394,2.1032,1.484,1.982,1.1487,5.9069,6.2016,0.0875,0.4771,1.3627,5.5909,7.41,2.9894,4.9403,7.7804,1.1876,4.2061,0.0005,0.6789,6.2704,0.8162,6.6097,3.5481,0.2466,0.0744,5.865,6.1538,4.2238,0.8135,1.4323,3.487,2.6925,5.6365,2.0689,6.1259,0.0764,6.3839,0.5628,2.342,0.2624,10.9842,3.9448,4.9612,1.1298,5.2172,2.0164,1.5722,4.6079,3.9638,3.0421,0.0055,0.1044,6.5386,7.441,0.3888,1.7251,2.0906,2.2249,7.3369,1.8908,0.0042,0.0889,0.5766,0.0107,0.0247,3.8897,3.731,1.0621,3.4025,1.6709,1.8971,0.6146,0.4129,1.0082,5.9648,3.7033,3.1385,4.395,0.0174,2.3295,4.1298,0.9204,1.4846,4.0586,5.5617,5.0622,6.4231,3.5149,0.5639,3.2909,0.0018,4.1102,3.0774,1.0064,1.4004,1.2591,3.3296,2.0488,5.9062,1.0118,3.2342,0.3017,0.3158,2.4303,3.3985,3.0896,0.5804,0.326,0.9259,1.1645,2.3557,4.1243,0.0714,3.4204,1.9879,2.1294,4.359,0.0395,4.2094,0.1431,6.2659,2.2431,3.7607,0.0642,1.0384,5.8577,1.3936,0.779,1.7995,0.6281,4.3129,7.2683,2.4557,1.5454,3.991,0.0028,0.0043,4.6328,4.1108,0.7092,1.0004,6.7199,2.0175,5.192,1.1542,3.5572,2.8666,4.4473,2.9957,3.7521,0.7173,1.687,6.2389,0.6154,4.7712,3.4616,1.0369,6.2323,3.1774,0.9254,4.0208,1.7313,6.5234,1.6468,2.0598,1.4397,1.9627,3.6182,4.418,1.1557,1.0237,2.1604,1.1,6.3117,3.3034,2.3773,1.7173,3.645,4.0496,1.0942,5.6546,3.7068,1.9798,1.9485,3.3408,0.6107,1.7894,3.0697,1.2935,1.0913,4.061,4.5207,1.214,3.1682,4.2703,1.0739,3.3434,6.9026,1.5992,0.3785,7.9962,1.653,5.1267,3.061,4.7174,3.6772,3.267,1.6149,0.8405,2.5997,3.3223,2.4548,4.6407,1.3362,0.3675,1.5406,3.1752,0.3359,3.1901,4.687,0.049,1.7284,1.5976,2.1953,0.5448,4.4561,1.0245,2.4219,2.1809,1.7462,1.4281,0.7688,3.5296,1.8573,4.7322,1.3769,4.6391,4.6298,2.7103,3.5794,0.8463,1.8865,1.3617,0.4887,0.4494,4.3845,0.9221,1.0076,2.3596,0.5801,0.3565,2.5608,1.3065,3.4976,0.966,2.1167,0.1898,2.4599,0.6062,5.6131,2.0347,1.3405,1.4992,1.7276,1.7747,4.0217,0.4056,2.5575,0.3675,3.7637,3.294,0.8664,2.0069,1.98,0.1263,7.1405,9.7593,1.7376,3.3567,1.8588,6.0088,0.5986,2.4032,0.1529,1.631,0.316,3.024,5.4385,0.9499,0.5497,1.2189,3.7267,1.6104,1.2113,2.5956,0.8175,0.8004,3.0789,9.574,5.4734,0.6706,4.7887,1.853,2.8887,0.8275,4.3152,1.5815,3.8705,3.3604,3.4168,2.0814,7.1441,0.3066,1.2347,1.2114,2.4807,6.4717,2.7696,6.195,0.1917,0.6971,5.1992,0.0562,0.0549,0.0435,2.6032,4.0405,0.0126,5.0254,1.6655,4.3324,5.5452,1.7437,0.9338,5.9974,1.4171,1.6979,0.9092,0.1437,0.3749,1.3259,2.9108,0.0142,1.9105,2.4079,3.9357,1.2032,2.5621,1.3636,3.5444,0.5066,2.2894,2.3018,8.2815,3.4159,0.995,2.9919,4.3977,2.6269,2.0212,6.8113,1.1796,0.9108,4.2786,1.6618,3.2568,1.764,4.2267,5.3231,1.4683,3.9388,4.2231,4.3957,2.1566,4.0715,0.0185,1.1432,2.3735,2.4198,2.3207,0.0076,2.0525,5.0086,2.4688,0.0432,2.445,2.1732,6.2631,5.05,2.2364,1.0712,2.1729,4.4894,0.6307]}
{"prompt":"Austrian conservatives and the anti-immigrant Freedom Party ( FPO ) have agreed to expand voter participation in legislative matters in their coalition deal to bring the state closer to the citizens , the party chiefs","text":"Austrian conservatives and the anti-immigrant Freedom Party ( FPO ) have agreed to expand voter participation in legislative matters in their coalition deal to bring the state closer to the citizens, the party chiefs said.\nThe agreement provides a framework for the political parties to engage in a broad-based dialogue with the people on all matters of legislative and executive interest, says the agreement which takes effect from Sept. 29, 2015.\nHowever, it will not apply to the Federal Diet elections on Oct 11 or other federal matters. They will still operate according to the existing provisions.\nThe Federal Diet is the top legislative body in the federation with the right to propose laws which are then forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval and are finally passed into the Federal National parliament.\nUnder its agenda setting role in the coalition, the parties want to focus on the need to introduce transparency in public administration and the way government policies are formulated and put in place as well as a new constitution.\nIt also includes a request from the FPO to extend this process to non-party members. In the FPO\u2019s previous agreement with the coalition, it was only limited to those who were members of the party.\nIt will also work to expand public participation beyond electoral matters and will include consultation on other policies involving issues such as environment, transport as well as social and cultural issues, the parties said.\nWhen I was younger, one of our neighbors had a yard full of chickens. I grew so fond of these beautiful creatures that my dad finally bought my own when I went to graduate school. I am sure the family had plenty of fun feeding them but sometimes it was tough getting them to come inside.\nOne of my favorite memories involves an event at church. My mom, dad, and I would all go to church together in the morning. After worship we would all sit in rows at a picnic table. At some point in our service the children were required to bring in their chickens so we can feed them. We kept track of the total number of chickens at the picnic table as we were able to count all of the chicken feathers on the ground next to us. We found that the total number of chickens at the table was always a perfect multiple of fifteen.\nA number of years ago I purchased a large house on the outskirts of a small town and built a fenced yard. I was able to see through the window from my office in the house that I had seven roosters and a hen in my yard. When I was told I had seven chickens I couldn\u2019t believe it! This story makes me realize it may be time for another update on my chickens.\nLast night I went to the post office in my little town and there was a package waiting for me with a note from my two fattest roosters. I had not sent them out the last time I checked because I thought they were too large for the box and there was a chance that the package could get lost. The package I received was in a small brown paper bag and it contained a blank booklet with seven pages.

The commission, however, replied by saying that it would need the President's approval for any such announcement.\nThe assembly yesterday elected the first woman to lead the country's army. A general belonging to the new Nepal Police would become the fourth civilian president after the dissolution of the previous three in a military coup in 2009.\nThe assembly today began its two-week

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s doubts about the war in Afghanistan has led to a delay in completing a new U.S. strategy in South Asia , skepticism that included a suggestion that the U.S. military","text":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s doubts about the war in Afghanistan has led to a delay in completing a new U.S. strategy in South Asia, skepticism that included a suggestion that the U.S. military would abandon plans for air, artillery, and ground forces on its campaign against the Taliban. Trump has also repeatedly criticised the decision made by Barack Obama when he asked Afghanistan\u2019s president Hamid Karzai to extend the military presence, and he expressed doubts about how to proceed in the future in Afghanistan.\nHowever, some experts say that the United States would continue to carry out their military objectives in Afghanistan. \u201cThis is not an immediate withdrawal. Even if some of the troops do move back, it will not be a withdrawal. Many things change,\u201d said a senior Pentagon official in an interview with Express. \u201cWe have decided that we need to reevaluate the whole matter in coordination with the Taliban.\u201d In recent months, the Taliban has said that it was ready to discuss a permanent cease-fire with the United States. \u201cThis would lead to a formal cease-fire from the Afghan government. This will not change our strategic goals,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nIn the United States, there has been a sharp focus on the Taliban\u2019s proposal to end the military action in Afghanistan, and a statement of the Afghan government\u2019s willingness to discuss any demands. In recent months, the U.S. official said, the U.S. intelligence community has expressed a growing sense that the Taliban is willing to make more concessions than they previously suggested. \u201cThere are two sides here. The Afghan government is talking, but it may not be able to reach the end result,\u201d the official said.\nIf the U.S. considers a permanent cease-fire with the Afghan government, it will be less likely that it has to work with the Taliban. However, experts do not believe that Taliban representatives have discussed any proposal for a permanent cease-fire with the government, and it cannot be ruled out that the group will continue to raise demands for greater military participation from the Afghan government.\nAs part of the \u201cdeal\u201d proposed by Washington, the Taliban should also renounce terrorist targets. In early January 2021, in an interview with the Guardian, a Taliban spokesman had said that the group has agreed to negotiate with the United States through negotiations held in Qatar. However, it could not be ruled out that the Taliban will continue to take actions to support their terrorist activities. The official said that the United States has given the Taliban \u201cinstructions and instructions are being implemented\u201d. The official said that the process of preparing military targets for attacks remains on track.\nThis is an exciting opportunity to live near the beaches of Costa Blanca and have the amenities of one

Coveney added that any deal for \u2018the border post\u2019 or \u2018backstop\u2019, the proposed mechanism needed for a deal to avoid a hard border between the U.K. and Northern Ireland, will have to be based on a specific proposal.\nUS President Donald Trump has said he would sign a deal Friday on ending the government shutdown, his first real test as he seeks a Democratic majority in the U.S. senate. A Senate Democratic committee will hear arguments from representatives on whether they can confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this week, after the Republican committee rejected the nominee and called on the Senate not to let the process continue. The Republicans\u2019 position has come under fire in the House of Representatives, where Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy called for a vote Thursday to decide whether to reopen the government or allow the process to be stopped by filibusters.\nJapan will suspend flights to and from the U.S. and other countries until the end of next month in response to mounting pressure to reconsider air travel amid coronavirus concerns. The suspension, announced by Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and his counterpart Mike Pompeo, comes days after Japan imposed a 14-day quarantine on foreigners with suspected exposure to the virus. Both countries are struggling to contain a sudden upsurge in cases. Last week a U.S. official said Trump had approved Japan\u2019s request \u2014 it will remain under Japanese oversight.\nDwight D. Eisenhower is to be buried in Arlington\u2019s National Cemetery, a ceremony scheduled for Thursday. His name will be inscribed with the rest of the leaders who died before he assumed the office of U.S. president, the National Park Service announced Wednesday. He will be at the head of the grave monument dedicated to all presidents, not just the living ones. His coffin will lie alongside the two graves of his wife and the men who served alongside him during the war. It has been a privilege every man should experience.\nThe United States had a coronavirus infection toll of more than 4 million as of Tuesday, the highest in the world, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The total is more than a quarter higher than Brazil and four times the toll of Russia, which has been hit hard by a winter coronavirus surge.\nThe global outbreak will not end with coronavirus curbs, and could lead to the extinction of the world\u2019s wild dog population. And a pandemic is already forcing zoos in the United States to release animals, experts warn. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said that of its 34,000-strong membership, over 100 zoos had voluntarily begun releasing animals in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cIf any zoos have no choice but to release animals, they should do so,\u201d said Steve Jones, chief executive of IUCN, the world\u2019s largest conservation organization. \u201cThe human cost is already enormous.\u201d","token_len":653,"entropy":[8.4279,8.8118,0.566,4.8073,8.9586,0.2737,7.6687,0.9148,1.65,4.1004,0.8088,1.7112,5.3381,0.9679,1.5684,7.707,1.9894,5.1009,0.0178,0.0,0.0,0.578,1.8286,1.7908,3.0329,13.157,0.0026,2.8595,0.662,6.2722,4.3968,4.3053,0.6847,1.4814,0.002,2.499,1.0435,5.1944,4.161,2.2534,0.1215,1.9244,0.7303,7.0844,0.0001,0.0003,4.7676,0.3491,4.4911,0.9129,4.8854,15.4407,7.0813,3.4807,2.1465,6.6524,3.4264,6.7503,5.9807,3.2592,0.1665,7.4906,6.0686,0.9708,0.6091,4.4743,3.3744,5.9914,6.8746,6.2215,1.6245,3.5077,3.3561,1.5946,7.1249,1.4853,4.0049,0.12,2.8792,0.8996,5.1748,0.0014,0.2564,0.2687,0.0162,3.8249,0.0059,0.2306,4.0178,2.3381,0.0408,0.4215,5.2065,0.1738,1.5295,5.6231,3.8672,1.6751,0.4138,19.3587,1.1833,0.6749,0.0119,1.6385,2.1187,0.8455,1.7424,2.9546,0.9302,2.2673,9.3291,3.3444,5.401,0.423,6.1552,1.6468,1.3821,6.3933,0.6324,5.2274,3.1587,2.4296,3.9508,2.7008,2.4856,6.446,0.8682,0.3893,0.6559,1.3881,0.0005,0.0349,0.0297,7.1828,0.3237,4.0938,4.7493,3.876,5.069,2.869,4.5872,3.1415,2.8723,4.9497,3.1515,4.839,4.641,1.9961,5.6133,7.5938,2.5884,0.0029,1.6566,0.2301,0.6126,0.0021,4.1191,0.2742,1.5817,3.6084,1.688,3.8592,8.9275,2.5145,1.7223,2.0769,4.6725,4.9229,1.261,1.4083,1.8503,4.776,0.0033,5.1838,1.319,4.2813,1.931,0.283,2.6771,4.9391,12.5852,4.6991,9.4493,2.2633,4.8488,0.3327,1.494,2.3109,1.4251,3.8631,1.1446,0.0748,1.0545,1.0431,4.7973,0.1585,0.4022,0.0005,4.8078,1.2697,1.1029,1.5172,3.6301,1.8267,6.7835,0.9407,0.284,4.6578,0.0619,0.1878,3.5878,3.5274,1.3359,4.0904,0.084,4.2547,4.0556,3.8153,5.6491,0.1075,0.4106,0.8077,9.6815,3.8852,5.6425,6.2125,0.7704,1.9582,0.0081,0.6204,0.8811,0.0005,0.5324,0.2623,3.2924,3.1889,1.3357,3.2819,1.3984,1.9976,0.0017,2.4664,1.6967,4.0681,1.4311,0.0077,5.9226,2.3101,2.8726,7.4931,8.5905,0.8119,6.2938,18.2577,3.1878,2.5921,4.6539,0.7741,1.838,4.5383,2.7862,2.8318,1.7168,3.98,0.1568,9.6175,3.3605,0.0657,4.8935,5.9979,0.1089,3.2811,3.6003,2.8302,8.0403,3.8781,0.0002,0.5579,2.1493,4.0049,0.1204,2.8986,5.211,1.1532,5.7557,0.2464,0.5029,2.7985,0.3604,6.6784,4.7795,1.6435,4.5652,0.1142,1.6373,0.75,0.8299,6.4578,1.4213,2.1003,5.7366,0.3866,2.2598,2.5941,7.6142,6.7693,0.115,0.0002,0.4247,1.6694,3.0664,5.021,0.5681,4.3115,4.1168,0.0005,0.109,0.0645,2.0695,1.0226,6.4099,1.8947,4.7527,3.5731,10.0016,1.6917,1.1452,2.8988,7.5783,6.069,4.1612,3.7082,4.0335,4.1308,4.8388,2.3466,0.7219,5.1975,6.4849,0.0771,2.5869,0.1254,0.0157,3.819,5.662,1.9865,4.3042,0.8714,1.4807,11.8201,0.1201,1.7431,1.8859,0.0528,2.3908,2.8936,3.0708,3.1934,0.4079,2.8809,1.1493,3.9653,4.4825,0.9322,0.3085,2.9718,2.3277,0.6106,8.9553,0.0246,0.359,7.8881,2.7419,2.0906,5.0827,1.4866,6.4536,0.8557,3.3496,2.0802,3.622,0.0005,0.0019,0.0027,0.3481,2.8573,3.1697,3.0237,2.9473,0.0018,1.1562,2.6479,0.2183,3.1682,2.7125,0.3841,6.7093,0.8522,4.0748,0.2054,0.6674,6.6203,6.6539,5.1351,0.1555,6.1653,4.0685,1.9462,5.4095,0.0283,2.13,8.2688,3.7796,0.4325,4.3236,3.5166,0.4177,4.3253,4.2702,1.063,5.4738,4.4639,0.7125,2.587,2.5005,1.929,4.1122,5.6393,1.0233,2.0067,3.6013,0.0991,2.2089,0.957,2.0816,0.575,4.7266,3.9902,0.4058,2.692,6.8445,9.187,3.8494,6.0542,5.2846,1.7632,0.9812,2.83,4.2653,0.1548,4.4615,2.8421,11.7814,0.0073,0.0011,3.6786,11.0783,0.4695,3.6805,0.0065,3.9311,3.1465,4.9014,0.5027,3.052,0.8773,2.1898,3.0165,2.0642,2.1041,1.9068,1.0558,1.8181,0.0023,5.1585,1.7233,0.0516,6.1985,0.0009,0.8626,0.9022,1.5558,6.0485,2.8014,2.9086,0.0149,4.0473,1.8407,4.809,0.0451,9.5061,2.2635,4.803,0.3961,2.0961,6.1686,1.4497,3.7888,1.2711,1.5738,1.3028,2.3154,2.2391,2.808,0.3743,2.2487,6.2791,10.1306,0.0417,0.0004,8.7946,0.7501,1.2606,1.9833,6.6788,2.4104,5.372,3.5393,2.4805,2.7789,7.9129,0.0168,0.0658,7.7395,5.6837,2.693,3.5424,5.8354,3.4197,0.0418,2.6817,5.2876,0.0205,2.188,3.804,5.4008,0.2681,1.1433,6.3393,5.6888,1.9537,1.0496,5.4869,4.0598,4.8186,0.0032,3.1395,2.765,7.7431,8.4325,2.2476,3.2143,1.5295,1.9187,0.0474,0.5056,7.4646,3.0075,3.7911,5.5386,3.1531,0.245,2.419,4.4446,1.5652,0.1107,0.4361,0.0078,0.0017,2.8613,2.9958,5.4721,4.2934,5.0485,1.8726,0.5648,4.2188,2.6142,5.253,0.3994,5.0171,3.1267,5.5968,0.0011,3.6007,6.0155,5.7169,2.1582,1.0735,2.2791,3.1174,0.0718,0.9472,3.5894,0.0021,0.0113,5.6427,0.0088,0.5089,0.9548,4.4186,5.6164,7.9508,4.5944,3.9598,0.0104,4.3798,4.476,2.3321,0.478,0.0183,1.6235,0.5286,0.5313,1.4162,1.7406,3.047,0.0549,2.721,9.192,6.5558,0.9887,5.5472,5.6733,0.1758,3.5201,1.1514,0.6351,6.3655,0.2176,0.0013,2.0461,1.3889,1.6124,10.199,0.1324,0.0923,2.2979,1.6059,0.3391,0.1276,5.3879,0.4889,2.2479,5.4816,4.465,2.5168,3.6396,3.9136,1.0559,3.0043,2.1339]}

I found a","text":"When soldiers burst into her village in southwest Cameroon last month with guns blazing, small farmer Eta Quinta, 32, raced into the forest with three of her children. I found a tree, jumped into it and hid, she \u2026\nI\u2019m a self-proclaimed romantic; my favorite Christmas movie is \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d and I\u2019m the biggest Harry Potter fangirl alive. But I think most of the world would agree that I tend to prefer my winter holidays with as little turkey and tree decorating as I can get away with, and the most heartwarming, joyful feeling of the holiday season to me is sitting down with a glass of eggnog and a hot, cozy fire.\nWhether it\u2019s in person or via a screen, my home office feels cozy like that. The chairs are comfortable and the decor is festive, and I can just imagine what I\u2019m doing right now \u2013 probably a little too much typing on my keyboard \u2013 in an equally magical place, thanks to the latest additions from Microsoft and Microsoft 365.\nI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for you, but no one\u2019s in our household does Christmas feel like a complete season with nothing but presents and decorations left on the tree by the morning after Christmas, so I was pretty excited about the latest additions to Microsoft and Microsoft 365.\nThe first two Christmas-related features were quite fun to try \u2013 and I can\u2019t wait to play more of them in the coming weeks.\nThe first of these is called Holiday Recipes. At the very least, the food that could be made with this app is worth trying. If you\u2019re a bit of a foodie, or you\u2019re always looking for some holiday cooking inspiration, this app has you covered.\nIt includes an extensive, growing collection of recipes, ranging from traditional to modern \u2013 and, according to the description, updated weekly. The apps\u2019 interface is a little cluttered \u2013 if you like to use the recipes\u2019 tags and then sort by type, then it\u2019s a bit of a pain to search for what you\u2019re looking for \u2013 but it is useful enough for me.\nIn addition, Microsoft is allowing users to share those recipes with friends in the Microsoft 365 family, so you can let people in your own household check out all of your holiday cooking skills as well.\nA second feature Microsoft has added to the Microsoft 365 holiday season celebrations is Live Meeting. This feature brings us all together virtually. It\u2019s a great feature to have and something I think we all need right now, and as more and more organizations close down and allow their workers to work from home or off-site.\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest addition to the Microsoft 365 lineup (including Outlook for iOS\/Android and Word for Mac and Windows) offers an even more modern, attractive and organized experience.\nI found it really comfortable to work in on my mobile device. It also feels like a more secure and reliable environment, at least when it comes to meeting the safety standards, as most of us could probably attest right now during the pandemic.","token_len":653,"entropy":[9.7364,8.358,0.5043,5.9691,4.6967,2.5439,8.2934,4.7906,3.6066,1.3578,3.6311,3.4592,2.8328,0.3746,9.2123,9.6169,5.8642,5.5604,8.9736,2.3195,3.1103,4.0029,0.0102,8.5862,2.72,1.1331,3.9578,2.5732,4.2183,2.8599,0.2271,1.6716,1.6103,7.4868,4.5855,3.5133,5.2469,2.4999,7.9555,1.8822,0.7415,0.6619,4.7289,3.4337,3.7475,13.2199,2.7465,9.0774,14.4966,7.6463,2.3862,2.7247,6.9423,0.1255,1.906,9.8451,5.3428,3.321,6.6152,7.7397,4.1435,1.1728,7.801,4.3283,5.7282,2.5777,2.4714,0.5241,2.604,4.7846,0.067,1.522,3.7898,7.589,1.58,0.9087,3.5934,0.0984,0.1181,4.393,4.3276,7.5157,0.0351,8.297,2.1483,0.0181,4.39,0.4644,2.6822,1.4118,4.2808,4.7732,0.8659,2.1659,3.6307,3.1253,2.1375,0.3749,1.5353,8.2816,0.0993,4.2395,3.3781,8.4293,2.1153,3.6117,7.9424,1.822,7.8073,2.7994,8.5169,7.1062,2.351,0.0871,2.9855,0.8159,2.134,2.1501,0.1664,2.3076,1.7961,3.7643,4.4126,7.3143,0.3367,3.978,5.5112,5.7529,1.4139,2.8732,3.4249,0.7617,5.135,1.4555,0.5082,5.269,2.3467,1.3546,1.6052,6.4335,0.0352,8.0199,0.7642,0.0005,1.1094,1.3115,5.108,3.4335,5.6826,3.8719,1.1162,0.8736,7.6586,1.5223,4.1013,0.7132,0.0497,4.3089,4.9446,0.454,3.7752,3.1224,6.8063,1.9201,3.6051,5.7924,4.7879,5.879,4.5025,5.8113,4.744,2.2072,2.7979,6.8869,1.0,3.7055,1.2972,2.0322,5.1996,0.6016,5.6434,1.5519,2.0263,1.7139,2.6388,4.057,2.5147,3.2943,2.6847,3.7681,0.1693,0.4525,2.7747,5.6908,0.2177,5.8539,7.863,3.4844,2.5603,3.1908,1.2489,7.8835,2.6043,0.8176,2.4773,1.9838,3.3625,3.6091,7.5269,8.2923,2.7251,2.775,6.5176,0.0836,1.2922,7.4305,5.0583,4.6191,4.8212,1.9354,3.6764,8.0888,0.5205,0.8568,2.5313,3.1449,0.6989,0.4054,0.0398,1.8705,1.9115,3.2377,1.564,0.0541,0.0322,0.1856,4.0611,3.524,2.2936,0.7716,7.1655,1.2108,6.4892,0.0699,1.1875,5.2434,4.345,2.9175,4.3251,7.3826,6.2671,0.812,1.2166,6.1174,8.4365,5.3001,4.3637,1.5697,6.6515,1.2925,3.3354,5.8202,2.753,0.2159,5.1789,6.0435,0.7499,4.8527,3.6988,1.6426,1.8967,2.0809,0.9929,4.1313,3.5583,1.514,2.0414,1.4107,4.9207,1.4478,0.9816,2.7647,3.3894,1.096,0.5271,0.7708,1.3479,2.7681,2.4215,4.1701,6.2178,4.5565,1.4087,2.577,2.5233,5.2155,4.5677,1.751,3.8992,4.1539,3.2181,1.8232,3.7169,5.125,0.1953,0.0121,0.8381,0.2003,4.3468,4.5215,1.198,0.9661,2.2812,0.5799,1.9436,0.8824,0.4398,1.5952,2.6043,1.8908,2.6273,0.7641,1.5691,3.2616,5.4631,8.6793,1.4391,6.1767,1.4828,2.9333,0.7074,0.2442,3.3065,6.0438,3.8298,6.4873,0.5535,3.0153,1.6724,2.1455,3.8826,1.1016,5.7938,3.2641,1.0667,3.6737,0.2192,5.1102,0.1611,3.17,2.1193,5.6645,1.6795,0.2402,3.6526,0.4051,0.4395,3.8767,1.951,4.735,0.0326,2.5139,6.3481,1.7079,0.1902,2.8284,3.2023,5.3719,2.4335,0.2521,1.7829,1.8639,2.9792,1.256,0.0014,0.3137,0.9357,3.7233,4.6474,3.6934,3.4178,5.8154,6.7603,3.2862,0.0065,1.0846,1.6688,3.6685,0.0221,3.6899,3.9827,2.1088,4.1118,1.9684,3.4465,5.4546,0.0013,1.3074,4.7936,0.4641,9.0502,4.0947,0.4802,2.4889,4.7426,9.1836,0.1043,11.0381,0.722,2.8771,1.1624,3.3577,0.0001,2.9465,4.3951,0.2922,2.9411,2.4886,2.936,1.4301,7.9293,8.5841,0.0178,11.3963,3.159,5.3372,5.3976,0.7266,4.1288,0.5011,3.0843,3.2099,2.0827,0.0209,0.1133,1.8934,2.0511,2.6275,0.1575,1.6499,1.0783,3.5717,1.1046,4.0035,0.2808,2.3367,0.0843,0.9131,0.3021,0.0134,3.8241,0.9849,2.1528,2.6135,5.4186,3.827,2.0224,1.208,1.0059,0.6361,3.6731,1.3999,1.3507,4.942,2.7314,4.8311,2.8576,0.0745,3.1053,6.0754,0.6302,0.9185,1.7158,4.0613,1.0811,5.2415,5.27,4.8043,1.3834,1.207,1.4644,0.6062,6.2295,3.4523,3.7622,1.2338,5.5847,3.614,6.4064,0.522,3.9367,0.9942,1.2062,3.6964,4.1625,5.7573,3.8164,0.9303,1.0874,0.769,4.502,2.7303,1.4288,7.9117,1.3966,0.946,0.9722,0.8451,5.0017,0.7631,5.4926,3.0972,9.7027,0.4215,7.0267,9.5278,0.6151,1.71,1.8077,4.1235,5.8317,3.734,0.3083,10.1952,4.0251,2.6989,2.1612,0.0499,0.0069,0.9963,2.1982,2.8809,1.9426,0.7655,3.8665,4.3765,1.2326,3.4112,2.2669,0.7018,2.5553,4.944,0.0316,1.5401,2.3759,4.6697,5.4121,0.7213,0.0025,7.1353,7.6158,3.3986,3.5378,5.1143,2.8668,5.2934,0.2432,3.3204,3.9203,0.0422,3.264,5.2752,1.1803,0.4455,4.9137,0.5767,3.339,8.8352,0.0236,0.4313,5.3228,4.1057,0.8115,0.4923,1.2183,0.2863,6.2477,5.2241,3.7735,5.311,3.1089,2.8654,5.6707,0.6246,2.3536,4.4151,1.3251,1.6673,2.7082,1.1974,1.9563,5.3383,2.7465,2.9874,0.7541,4.9558,2.0959,8.337,1.5707,5.4846,2.7651,1.3047,1.6127,2.5201,3.563,2.0526,3.1466,6.767,1.1684,2.9838,2.2313,6.2976,1.5732,4.7805,1.494,2.5658,1.9625,3.9335,2.8549,1.2026,1.1552,4.1137,3.9379,1.4994,4.6808,4.4173,1.6622,6.2284,0.4793,2.3435,0.7002,0.0853,0.0115,5.9844,4.2638,7.5499,4.045,4.1087,3.9557,4.9096,0.9816,2.7545,6.0491,3.815,3.8159,7.6793,0.4087,7.9539,1.5255,9.9244,0.0393,1.0808]}
{"prompt":"British Prime Minister Theresa May is fully focused on tackling extremism , her spokesman said on Thursday , responding to a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump telling her to focus on destructive Radical Islamic","text":"British Prime Minister Theresa May is fully focused on tackling extremism, her spokesman said on Thursday, responding to a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump telling her to focus on destructive Radical Islamic terrorism. It wasn't clear from that tweet if he has a list of targets. The U.S. government has long insisted that it has a list of ISIS targets so it can strike them back - but the list has never been made public, nor has the president said anything that suggested he might need it as he confronts a deadly Islamic State campaign against U.S. forces in Syria. He has instead suggested that there may be additional targets available, such as the city of Mosul, home to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and to a substantial Shi'ite Muslim population who have been a key ally in defeating ISIS. U.S. government sources told CNN that while the president had a list of possible targets, he still needed to decide what to do with it and with which forces to act against them. \"We will have to wait and see,\" Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani later told the New York Times, saying the president \"has no list of targets.\" But on Thursday, the premier's spokesman confirmed a previous report from the Telegraph that Trump had suggested ISIS, Al Qaeda and other global jihadist militants were planning an imminent attack using the same bombings that had taken place throughout the European city. U.S. intelligence agencies have said they are tracking about 200 extremist individuals in Europe, of which about 70 have been designated as targets of the U.S. military, according to CNN. May has said she has no intention of giving up her fight against terrorism and that she was going to continue to hunt the remaining \"foreign terrorists who are at risk here in UK, because we cannot let that leave our doorstep.\" She has repeatedly said she wanted her troops to use more lethal force against ISIS. But her spokesman said the government has not made an effort to increase the number of people killed in such incidents. \"The Prime Minister has repeatedly opposed increased use of lethal force,\" he said. \"The government fully recognises the need to take action against terrorists who cause harm to our fellow citizens, and acts accordingly, but it is for the military to make that decision.\" The spokesman added that the UK is \"not open to extremists of all stripes and that the government will make no compromise in respecting the law.\"\nThis entry was posted in Events, Music, Photos, Uncategorized, Writer and tagged Adam Ant, Bob Dylan, John Prine, John Sebastian, Mark Knopfler, Pat Metheny, Pete Townshend, Robbie Robertson, Steve Martin, The Who, William Burroughs.

The trailer had me excited, and I bought tickets because I love David Bowie \u2013 and a \u201cDavid Bowie concert\u201d is a \u201cDavid Bowie concert\u201d. But when I pulled into the theater, the theater was not ready for the film (a \u201cDavid Bowie concert\u201d). There was a long line and the screening ended up taking over 1-hour longer than predicted.","token_len":653,"entropy":[8.686,0.0211,2.7836,0.002,3.1408,8.4328,4.8334,0.0182,3.8957,5.0862,1.5493,4.4732,2.6722,0.2401,1.855,1.8755,2.2876,5.9968,0.0118,1.5686,3.8571,1.3325,5.5832,0.1288,0.2682,0.0695,0.795,0.402,0.008,5.4174,1.4749,1.3759,3.0997,0.0957,11.9871,7.2054,0.5615,1.4317,0.5366,6.9312,4.5501,0.0005,1.2435,4.025,3.4333,0.2066,2.3838,2.7683,5.4344,2.4804,5.385,0.0795,2.3937,1.6761,3.5041,2.4086,0.0004,0.0413,0.0564,2.476,1.079,3.817,4.781,0.5961,2.2417,2.0518,1.9897,3.5752,0.1153,5.1893,1.1937,5.6045,1.2587,0.5998,4.818,1.6287,5.4848,6.6101,1.5488,2.0138,3.9773,1.981,3.1675,0.1923,2.6874,0.0951,2.3259,4.021,1.0649,1.9926,4.4245,2.7521,4.1582,4.2772,6.1074,2.047,3.0808,6.5543,1.8574,5.3134,2.0807,6.6782,2.3801,4.7954,3.4273,0.5032,5.1612,3.7936,3.1443,0.0003,0.0029,0.5171,1.3103,0.9719,1.7117,0.7923,5.4493,1.4675,4.9157,3.765,1.0893,3.7686,2.1521,0.1496,4.6602,0.3793,5.5938,2.221,2.3718,0.0018,2.0615,4.6462,0.0472,1.0483,0.8187,5.1674,0.0657,3.0233,0.0368,0.2526,0.0346,2.2608,2.1413,2.3485,4.8641,2.9268,6.8866,6.8177,0.0209,0.0131,2.2387,0.9636,4.2438,1.5866,1.1885,5.4567,1.9274,3.6764,1.2853,6.0417,2.1186,0.4625,4.8618,0.0007,0.0073,0.0335,5.6117,3.0985,1.6475,1.7887,1.1089,5.1617,1.3844,2.7802,3.7255,3.5746,0.6262,0.2704,4.6319,0.0762,0.6698,1.1155,5.167,3.7816,0.384,3.3773,2.3453,1.3601,0.5909,0.8589,1.2466,3.6557,5.7671,4.2168,4.8459,1.8268,5.9351,2.6631,2.2607,0.2527,2.0388,2.0083,3.1709,2.5705,0.2851,2.7515,0.1722,0.0372,1.2085,2.865,2.3543,7.3363,4.6313,8.1392,0.1835,5.7557,0.4463,2.5281,1.4713,0.0436,0.137,1.9018,3.1155,1.9663,0.9598,2.6749,2.3961,1.9103,4.9504,0.7235,0.8528,1.1295,2.9922,3.4629,0.7176,0.3063,2.0005,10.5366,2.1907,0.7834,3.2189,4.7524,5.3782,3.7831,2.2316,1.2041,4.8403,0.6383,2.838,1.038,4.9726,5.961,5.457,7.191,0.3518,1.1333,0.7598,7.3119,3.5099,6.0617,2.3602,3.7103,2.732,5.9741,0.3056,7.233,1.7529,3.7279,7.9151,2.2043,2.6139,2.7157,0.1463,7.4864,1.1328,7.4492,3.4408,3.274,4.3661,0.001,0.0096,0.0095,1.5273,1.5981,1.1325,1.739,2.3984,2.4215,5.5396,5.9228,3.5319,5.6024,5.378,2.3205,1.7254,1.3243,6.3631,1.5376,1.8818,3.8606,2.0143,0.8027,5.8685,0.7157,2.8105,2.8756,2.2483,1.0443,0.0003,0.009,0.2886,1.6334,2.2528,2.0545,0.0013,4.3107,0.2289,6.5622,1.7732,1.8833,1.3066,1.8312,1.5596,2.2928,0.0688,4.7253,0.3445,1.721,4.3841,0.3839,2.2975,2.154,2.174,0.9778,3.7905,5.4868,0.3052,2.2059,0.9899,7.3899,3.3039,5.5637,5.2244,4.858,1.4082,3.3484,1.4144,5.3581,2.2451,6.5106,1.957,8.5494,2.3203,4.7952,1.6575,3.9014,2.2565,3.2193,6.0322,2.3743,4.7254,0.573,2.6019,1.2621,3.7258,1.1255,0.9232,5.3401,5.2851,4.1302,0.7027,5.5321,4.7309,2.6845,0.7456,1.0305,1.5545,2.4287,2.4537,2.9767,1.3693,1.2245,2.0634,2.9283,2.3053,1.7859,2.5344,3.4315,3.0492,0.0873,5.3643,0.7648,0.7425,0.0227,3.7936,2.075,0.901,5.2269,3.5349,0.9885,1.3719,1.8089,2.9194,0.0027,0.9777,3.454,8.0263,5.8576,2.5427,0.0216,1.7162,0.0765,2.7548,2.1896,0.2704,0.4125,0.7936,1.9084,2.3217,6.2332,6.5692,0.0047,1.1324,1.4181,0.6923,3.4735,2.3046,2.2553,2.8624,1.4011,4.4896,1.7121,0.8695,2.2214,5.4012,0.6036,1.6175,1.2165,7.8312,1.628,3.114,3.3115,2.9515,1.1293,5.6484,1.2088,4.6426,0.4217,3.0386,2.4513,1.5267,1.3689,1.9139,4.1692,1.7014,0.4219,1.1251,4.5896,2.6433,1.9509,2.5067,7.0933,0.4423,7.5867,5.3904,2.4771,2.0948,2.8755,3.6926,2.2248,2.0533,1.2388,3.4236,3.4237,8.6297,2.4634,8.316,1.0641,2.9311,1.8847,3.0618,8.1473,5.0022,0.1274,0.0011,4.3259,11.7646,1.9668,9.6206,0.6911,7.2033,0.9094,9.1495,0.0518,0.1418,2.2017,10.025,2.9312,8.9758,10.3002,7.635,3.7582,7.0248,5.3895,0.3314,4.4797,6.6747,0.439,0.4015,3.3101,7.7933,0.5686,5.4426,5.9739,0.6865,0.033,1.8026,0.3938,6.9455,6.5737,0.1077,0.3168,5.1514,1.6455,0.0011,0.0002,0.2473,7.9974,4.6235,0.2671,3.6177,3.9019,0.2741,3.9984,6.3108,0.1929,5.3267,4.4476,0.3563,0.0068,3.1029,9.4276,0.4315,1.6396,0.2323,0.0072,1.0936,1.5867,4.7033,2.9176,4.6274,2.2445,7.1798,4.1429,0.074,1.802,1.9849,3.4278,2.9334,2.8275,6.6002,1.2889,4.9945,5.4152,2.1919,16.6664,6.02,8.2456,1.9654,9.3045,5.1919,0.5535,2.3343,6.1222,4.1064,2.7321,4.948,1.7093,2.1941,1.2556,7.0769,3.6347,3.8624,0.8812,4.466,6.9975,1.154,6.6761,1.8603,5.0014,10.0942,0.2537,7.5471,0.0507,7.278,2.9982,1.3895,3.0043,1.8475,4.3855,0.074,8.0484,0.0047,1.0293,1.6708,0.0864,1.8488,2.5931,2.9233,0.5858,6.879,1.9464,0.6983,3.2308,1.0304,2.0975,3.1388,0.8609,3.9599,5.2368,1.0892,1.9106,3.6195,4.6327,4.2105,2.6773,0.0488,0.9609,0.0038,0.4921,0.0399,0.0474,1.775,3.8228,0.7619,1.3226,4.3327,1.2621,2.8218,2.2481,4.965,5.1078,2.8866,3.0832,3.8598,5.4318,2.3536,3.5213,5.1789,0.1585,7.4388,0.4467]}
{"prompt":"The bribery case against U.S . Senator Bob Menendez survived a key test on Monday , as the federal judge overseeing his trial rejected a defense motion to throw out the most serious charges .","text":"The bribery case against U.S. Senator Bob Menendez survived a key test on Monday, as the federal judge overseeing his trial rejected a defense motion to throw out the most serious charges. Sen. Bob Menerendez, onetime presidential candidate, is the lone Democratic Senator serving in a high-profile office currently under scrutiny by President George W. Bush. Menendez denies that he violated federal law by receiving gifts and other improper contributions over a period of almost three years from businessman Henry Luce, who has been accused of paying favors in exchange for lucrative business contracts. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, was forced to resign last year over sex-story allegations involving a political aide. He has now been indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on a single count of bribery for receiving $25,400 in gifts from Luce. He will be put on trial in Boston after the Senate is convened for the new year. Menendez is charged with making an effort to procure Luce's business to get him to approve federal funding for his school in New Jersey and to win state contracts. He said at his trial Monday that in June he asked Luce to buy his support for Luce, who paid him $10,000 between Sept. 15, 2002, and June 30, 2003. He received the money in advance for the school contract and for being an advisor to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Luce also paid him $70,000 in advance for federal contracts for the school and airport projects. Menendez denies that he solicited Luce to bribe him, and in fact said that the money was a gift. But prosecutors say the payments were part of a scheme to influence him to provide lucrative business contracts that Luce had secured for U.S. companies. Defense attorney Richard Goldstein argued in court statements last year that in making the donation it was assumed that Luce would provide lucrative business contracts so the senator could keep the money. He argued Monday that because of the size of the payments, the bribery charges cannot stand. Goldstein also said he was in a better position to prove innocence given the evidence cited to date and said prosecutors are making a point by seeking to strip him of his legal team. Luce, the target of an ongoing federal investigation into illegal campaign contributions since he lost several lawsuits alleging kickbacks, and two New Jersey Republican senators deny the allegations. Lunce has filed a motion to change the case's venue to California, where prosecutors said they have evidence to prove he received the gifts. Senate Republicans have backed Luce and his business, seeking to protect him from federal prosecutors. Sen. John Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that Luce would be an \" expert witness \" in the case after he testified to the committee last month. On Monday night, he joined House Democratic leaders in asking the President to have Luce removed from office so he can face federal charges. \" This is a man with a criminal record, and he is the kind of man who needs to be put on trial, \" Chaffetz said. Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) agreed that the time should be right for a Senate panel to try Luce.","token_len":654,"entropy":[12.3103,2.9,2.2108,5.1744,0.4752,0.0093,0.0486,3.7635,3.0076,1.2148,0.0,10.9062,1.6964,6.604,4.1157,3.2337,2.0687,1.492,2.7534,1.2626,4.3191,1.7687,1.7629,3.6533,1.1266,4.3628,1.0076,4.4007,1.4717,0.908,4.531,0.0931,0.4554,6.3984,2.0828,1.0557,2.1837,7.5145,0.0089,2.306,0.0721,19.1046,3.737,0.5396,1.3179,7.278,6.6171,5.1707,0.6327,1.2387,2.893,3.3692,5.8419,2.1005,5.0147,6.4311,2.519,2.7831,4.1702,0.0926,0.2882,6.9136,7.5341,1.4868,2.6767,1.2153,4.3237,5.4571,0.0153,0.002,0.001,0.6436,2.0941,0.0088,5.2146,3.38,0.7047,4.7903,2.86,0.8874,0.9966,5.2422,3.1469,2.3067,3.0758,5.1009,3.8509,5.7416,1.3964,1.1069,0.1127,5.0057,2.3503,1.1767,2.5046,7.1623,4.8116,6.0683,0.5798,0.648,1.3358,2.4893,1.3416,1.4,0.1477,3.5824,6.0596,4.1623,0.5395,0.0012,4.8946,2.6224,4.848,0.4737,1.6204,0.0043,2.3631,1.8288,3.2273,0.151,0.5315,0.4481,2.1509,4.3589,0.1644,1.2159,2.7513,1.3337,3.3772,7.5279,1.4814,10.2914,0.3575,2.8174,1.896,5.3441,2.2745,0.9704,2.3367,1.7395,5.162,1.364,2.0694,1.6822,0.5707,0.3955,0.2265,0.0019,1.9497,4.105,0.0021,1.3074,2.9128,5.0121,1.1634,0.1538,1.6786,4.0894,4.5483,2.0272,3.7479,0.5826,5.7541,0.8424,1.0114,0.8771,2.071,0.0054,1.3648,3.1605,4.0706,1.1234,6.4845,0.3859,0.2694,1.1152,6.9346,6.1425,1.8409,4.9653,3.0116,5.5333,1.9587,1.2916,6.9183,0.8586,0.2184,1.4971,0.0012,2.2194,3.3988,0.1656,4.3658,3.8965,4.2686,0.0696,7.4462,9.929,0.0046,0.2433,3.5386,4.036,4.3619,1.5737,0.9367,4.2997,6.3242,3.9924,0.4866,1.4145,7.4489,2.6335,2.4812,0.0959,3.2061,2.5372,6.0353,3.1882,2.8536,2.1549,2.088,4.7388,4.6969,2.7824,1.2854,3.7671,0.2508,4.9552,5.5795,2.8167,3.8139,1.0799,0.0013,0.4822,4.1229,1.7725,7.9778,0.6962,5.4851,0.015,3.3244,1.84,4.9088,1.1679,0.5513,2.8356,0.437,0.2726,5.9367,5.4462,0.0047,2.9995,0.7837,3.2425,0.4374,0.0603,2.9531,2.1471,0.0127,0.8829,0.8023,2.8219,6.4893,2.2087,1.1255,2.1204,3.8765,3.7512,2.0791,1.2901,4.2788,1.6533,3.5176,6.8619,3.3826,3.3448,0.4237,1.5021,4.472,0.0016,0.0064,0.0267,2.3478,0.0017,5.204,0.634,3.1244,0.0041,3.5791,2.0721,2.0409,0.5344,5.8556,0.0047,0.0918,1.3775,4.2239,0.5472,6.5507,1.4832,2.1617,1.8952,1.2038,1.9332,6.1433,3.6527,0.6497,1.545,0.0002,4.8317,1.6236,0.3239,3.6528,0.0005,1.6463,0.0017,1.1423,5.0854,0.2826,1.8449,1.7958,4.3334,3.6092,2.0796,1.496,3.0351,1.9174,0.8733,3.7957,1.7472,1.9725,3.677,3.9773,1.323,2.1555,2.9312,0.7409,3.2253,0.0024,0.5187,1.9293,0.6805,3.5558,3.1894,0.8931,5.4365,4.4555,2.7738,2.2004,3.7182,2.4837,0.0038,1.8228,3.9038,1.9826,3.9195,0.0006,0.0011,0.0035,1.9705,0.7658,6.1313,2.1009,4.0507,8.2854,3.434,1.9207,1.3511,8.2124,5.0026,2.395,0.0495,4.648,4.817,0.722,4.6692,6.4789,0.2384,8.2145,0.5272,1.3985,0.0038,1.9678,3.8928,5.5511,2.0862,1.5345,5.8652,2.7758,2.4218,0.4742,5.0212,2.1467,1.8112,0.7277,2.6819,3.5219,7.1456,0.1318,4.4355,2.4021,0.7443,4.6569,0.1318,0.2175,3.1925,0.6301,1.6104,4.3439,3.1529,4.5561,2.6364,0.4664,3.7272,1.9088,0.9196,2.9376,2.3528,5.3939,2.2428,4.6256,0.0844,0.3249,3.4484,8.8479,5.0898,1.0357,3.4476,8.3047,5.1179,5.0807,2.7999,3.8806,3.3565,3.1528,5.2824,1.9902,4.632,4.5252,4.3005,0.8235,5.6789,1.8965,0.0249,0.666,5.007,5.2816,1.2318,5.0773,0.0059,2.0264,3.3143,8.5682,0.069,3.2701,2.6739,1.8447,1.4578,1.5974,6.4033,2.1673,0.9381,6.4306,2.4586,5.471,7.7983,8.1973,4.9307,6.0832,0.0106,1.3749,5.0474,5.4789,4.197,0.067,3.2412,1.3524,7.3164,2.5524,0.8941,0.5841,10.3851,5.1308,2.4701,5.3024,0.739,1.7972,0.7214,6.1034,0.3561,3.6187,5.3865,4.1455,1.5756,5.1737,1.0041,1.7846,3.4068,3.2626,2.0849,2.5175,2.9841,2.6561,1.9965,1.5963,3.2942,1.2755,1.9626,0.607,5.7753,2.5126,1.1506,6.6099,3.6973,0.0068,3.0599,2.3987,5.4122,4.0706,5.9436,0.4139,5.5554,1.9983,0.4212,4.2741,3.7855,1.2149,3.95,0.0014,2.0556,15.4472,0.0492,1.9555,0.0734,0.0277,0.0183,0.7015,1.9473,0.0048,0.0362,1.5991,1.3916,0.0448,0.0764,5.0298,1.5313,3.837,0.0038,3.9775,1.5466,4.3904,1.7287,14.6978,0.491,2.2331,1.1181,0.7688,0.7223,5.4413,2.2291,2.2804,3.7571,0.792,3.5327,2.0126,1.4765,0.7189,5.0011,0.5551,4.6345,0.1315,2.4487,4.9692,4.8303,3.9384,1.5907,0.8918,3.4673,1.2274,6.4989,0.4071,6.3241,2.8962,0.0016,2.3051,0.2071,1.0703,4.7667,0.7094,1.993,2.9886,3.4475,0.5017,0.5623,2.2646,8.2514,0.7238,1.119,4.1882,3.543,1.0076,3.5779,0.5384,1.9019,1.0382,1.7963,2.0064,3.5191,4.6818,0.0209,1.8175,0.6493,3.5006,0.2569,0.4987,2.3347,0.6806,0.2824,2.9438,7.0162,0.258,0.0002,0.1461,0.4533,5.5919,2.1387,0.0009,4.6753,1.2102,0.0004,0.0,0.4475,1.278,0.0017,0.0174,0.0196,0.7111,5.5532,2.4281,1.2621,6.5958,3.7906,0.5126,1.5461,0.666,2.3388,4.1721,2.8972,0.1101,4.9093,1.4175,0.0038,0.9082]}
{"prompt":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s former campaign manager Paul Manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in Ukraine , his defense lawyer Kevin","text":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s former campaign manager Paul Manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in Ukraine, his defense lawyer Kevin Goodman said on Monday, as the New York-based lawyer said the paper was \u201ccompletely legitimate\u201d and added that the US president knows it was true. It makes sense. Trump, a former campaign chairman for Manafort who was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Monday on a conspiracy charge related to helping Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko investigate his political opponent Joe Biden, said Manafort was a \u201cshield\u201d for him. \u201cHe protected my interests in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the government has done a bad thing to Mr. Manafort, so now he wants to shield me. \u201cIn a speech at the White House, Trump said Mr. Manafort was \u201cabsolutely unworthy,\u201d adding that he was \u201csick\u201d of the media. Asked why he did not hold Mr. Manafort in contempt of court, he said he did not have a good attorney then. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the best, so my decision there was based on the best available advice and it seemed to me that it was the best decision that I could make,\u201d he said. The two sides did not ask for a hearing in February. The prosecutors said Mr. Manafort misled the judge by trying to sell a \u201cdisastrous\u201d report that Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s team would investigate Biden. The New York Post reports: \u201cA lawyer for the Department of Justice on Monday said Paul Manafort and other associates worked with the president\u2019s campaign and were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for helping him secure Ukraine\u2019s investigations, as Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and others charged that he was trying to mislead the court. Lawyers for the Justice Department said Manafort worked for the campaign of former President Donald Trump, working closely with his son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and was paid for his assistance in obtaining Ukraine\u2019s investigations. The prosecutors charged that Manafort deliberately lied to the judge in December on a court order concerning the report he was trying selling, which described how Ukraine may seek to get Biden elected. The lawyer said on the 11th session of the District Court in Washington that Manafort \u201chelped to edit, with his usual skill, material contained in a prepared document titled \u201cSummary: Investigation of the Bidens and Possible Foreign Corrupt Practices.\u201d \u201cThe Post has seen a document copied into court, which has been prepared and prepared,\u201d he said. According to the defense, the \u201csummary\u201d was not a report, and the document contained numerous \u201cobvious\u201d errors, according the NY Post. \u201cIt certainly did not say to me what the Ukrainian prosecutors intended to do when they received this document. But what I did say was that it was certainly the kind of thing that would be done based on what you read in those documents that I had seen,\u201d he said. He told reporters on Monday that Justice Secretary William Barr has been reviewing the case.","token_len":654,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,11.7229,8.1085,7.4978,7.1917,2.0721,0.2718,1.628,0.0003,6.561,0.4741,6.3643,3.8898,2.975,8.467,0.0043,3.0558,0.2251,4.3167,7.2256,2.1196,6.7202,0.9821,2.0889,2.673,4.3354,3.7621,2.5069,3.1938,1.9628,4.6859,7.2546,1.5881,7.819,9.8382,1.2764,2.4828,1.5902,2.4935,3.3968,1.6354,4.3766,0.0228,4.9108,0.0206,2.0358,3.1517,2.0172,7.2085,2.163,14.0018,3.2996,6.889,7.2124,3.0743,9.0513,2.1581,6.5819,0.3417,1.4948,7.3094,3.7131,6.726,3.9817,1.4073,4.5949,0.2823,6.539,5.8638,1.7621,3.2556,4.0404,3.1792,3.4855,2.0536,1.6304,2.3373,4.3979,5.5208,3.1809,2.1711,6.5372,0.323,4.5752,0.3883,0.1849,0.1617,2.29,1.9979,4.3326,2.3683,4.0907,0.0924,4.0071,0.0058,4.5361,4.328,1.6416,2.2648,0.0002,0.0,7.7738,2.5159,3.569,3.4071,10.8885,0.9218,0.9742,3.5894,4.1249,2.1407,2.5846,10.4766,0.4119,11.0924,1.1452,2.1647,3.0939,4.1796,1.2779,4.6259,0.2448,3.0674,7.0811,3.961,2.6417,3.553,1.8836,3.4716,0.0041,2.0088,6.6155,2.2811,2.7685,2.8362,1.413,0.3356,0.5109,2.2536,0.199,2.207,3.4088,2.7341,3.9444,2.3236,3.4962,1.3594,4.8288,3.06,3.4069,3.8035,0.0129,0.4359,2.402,4.5499,4.7285,2.7308,5.2027,0.1672,6.1743,1.5112,1.7477,1.5637,0.0852,4.7951,3.0927,4.9582,2.498,0.6687,3.0607,0.0009,1.5295,3.5353,0.6554,5.0203,0.0015,0.0588,1.5013,4.0533,0.3079,4.555,10.1099,5.6759,0.5304,1.1624,2.7096,0.5151,0.8522,1.9343,2.6457,0.1224,4.7324,2.0821,1.2925,0.3089,1.056,1.8074,3.4419,1.6607,5.769,3.1027,0.6794,2.465,0.2007,6.1671,2.4558,0.0005,0.0845,3.2168,0.0785,0.651,0.0866,0.4576,1.8641,0.3882,2.0086,2.4916,0.3123,2.7018,2.0401,3.6779,5.627,8.8057,1.0571,2.2955,0.1873,1.5709,3.6528,4.7629,7.6229,0.0217,1.4795,2.7252,3.5106,3.7827,4.3718,4.55,3.4793,7.7098,1.3988,2.465,0.183,1.8613,3.2058,2.1868,5.3764,1.9778,4.7095,5.9051,0.9115,0.355,0.8836,2.3376,0.4158,2.4063,0.7516,2.9669,2.0592,1.0022,0.4049,0.3836,2.4936,0.5253,1.0797,0.6352,0.3055,0.0982,2.6666,5.1297,1.5484,4.2288,0.1887,7.1488,0.8938,1.3126,3.7726,3.2808,4.5275,1.3166,2.3915,5.8878,2.8091,3.3587,0.0016,0.1745,6.2292,1.129,3.6883,3.0282,4.5832,0.0141,4.9341,1.9426,12.4873,0.2343,4.6383,5.9166,1.8593,0.4708,2.9189,2.5686,3.5344,0.0006,1.2597,0.0002,7.5627,3.5223,2.5562,5.083,4.4167,4.929,8.8365,2.0994,1.6347,4.2066,0.0151,2.0035,4.8265,2.6398,2.3825,0.7716,4.281,4.3773,0.2848,2.0407,5.9582,0.0011,0.0425,3.4884,0.3713,1.2175,5.2039,0.0303,2.707,2.7477,2.628,3.8732,1.6199,1.7645,4.7839,3.2879,0.4531,0.1662,0.7603,2.719,4.6386,1.8244,4.6787,0.0406,0.6633,0.1431,0.0017,2.4921,4.4414,1.9118,5.427,6.0573,6.6145,0.1133,0.0121,8.1846,2.1419,3.3881,8.6303,0.0382,3.0887,0.1795,0.0213,2.1098,0.2721,0.3464,1.8304,6.9495,6.384,5.8724,1.7872,2.3554,4.8426,0.0085,5.3721,0.3818,2.5927,1.2758,5.0854,0.1856,1.2794,2.3313,0.0013,1.3237,2.9978,4.3163,1.7211,1.3752,1.7205,2.1592,2.1901,1.6829,5.2825,0.0135,1.1188,6.37,2.9265,0.019,2.2901,2.4092,0.749,0.0018,0.0032,0.0003,1.0432,0.0057,1.306,4.2428,1.9561,3.5196,0.0007,0.0002,1.0817,1.414,2.1725,0.3866,3.4607,1.5186,5.6094,1.174,2.5166,3.5507,5.3647,0.0117,0.009,1.982,0.4177,1.6564,4.38,3.8047,0.8212,0.7956,8.0224,3.3746,1.1007,0.3646,1.3138,2.2698,3.8357,3.6506,1.8079,8.1224,1.971,8.4993,1.8713,5.0532,3.3029,2.2734,3.7752,12.6609,2.1147,2.9247,5.3424,3.11,4.3913,5.2164,4.9644,0.5883,3.9427,7.1105,6.9258,1.0632,1.5071,5.4096,1.0344,5.4017,4.1464,8.5997,0.3185,7.2699,0.3525,0.1635,7.7661,0.0905,2.0651,1.0517,0.8064,1.4639,6.8759,0.1371,6.3303,0.0027,2.915,6.0857,5.0136,3.9362,3.1946,8.6657,4.5877,0.9366,9.7663,7.7206,0.1825,1.4253,6.5412,4.7459,4.7405,5.5888,0.6478,7.3717,4.8094,6.0507,1.0246,1.9409,6.8237,3.1986,2.8496,5.2178,6.3313,4.611,0.0392,0.6857,3.4198,2.0527,3.0369,3.7472,0.0609,1.3607,3.7001,3.6917,5.2045,2.7137,3.9811,7.5917,3.9665,5.0536,2.3568,1.9242,4.146,1.2142,4.2109,2.3293,4.0493,3.3249,1.2062,0.6544,5.4641,0.1488,0.2794,5.5552,0.0018,0.5951,3.8719,0.7783,1.6046,10.6282,0.0604,1.0349,0.753,0.2731,2.1415,3.298,2.2523,3.6272,2.9056,2.6119,1.7096,3.4798,4.9402,5.4405,7.6665,0.1805,4.8267,0.8963,2.2769,0.4596,2.4104,1.6084,5.1324,7.7188,8.3228,0.2485,0.2681,2.8016,0.0956,2.6846,7.0926,2.207,0.1122,3.3212,5.2766,2.6839,3.0773,1.775,6.027,5.0196,4.9809,0.6773,0.8718,4.5423,0.5877,5.1642,3.1375,2.4979,1.1147,3.1902,4.1884,1.3114,2.293,3.1608,1.0369,0.8592,2.4074,0.7574,6.0349,3.6092,4.409,0.0228,2.2316,0.379,2.0449,1.4368,3.2368,6.5742,0.0714,1.874,4.0863,3.0526,0.7114,5.6326,0.9441,4.0388,2.4716,2.4387,2.1903,2.2714,0.445,0.3136,1.8254,0.1478,0.0591,3.1698,4.6034,2.8209,1.9549,0.5956,0.2689,7.7565,5.58,4.1711,7.4359,3.8423,2.4267,3.1794,0.3181,3.3909,1.3695]}
{"prompt":"The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel","text":"The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, one of the latest moves by Trump in a campaign to strengthen Israel.\nWELCOME! We're glad you visited our official website to learn of the latest news! You may have heard about us through some of our local social media platforms or you may have seen us at an event. And, if you're visiting for the first time, you may have heard that we're planning a huge announcement or something major for 2021. We'll continue to keep you updated on our news and announcements on our website and social media platforms. We're always looking for the best content and interesting tidbits from around the world to help you better understand foreign countries and cultures, as well as learn more about our own lives!\nIf you want to feel like you're in a foreign country, go to an undiscovered part of the city, or have a great laugh with awesome friends, then we invite you. We have a few openings, including those in our office, the art studio, and our greenhouse, but if you know of anyone who may be interested in being in our team, please let us know about them! We'll take on people of all ages and backgrounds, and you can even give us a call!\nWe are always looking for new volunteers to help out at The Other Place. We have no fixed hours, and our mission is always changing. However, we are very busy. The Other Place is in need of every assistance it can get, from art work for all of our walls throughout the place to helping with event planning to helping people with special needs.\nWe love working from home at The Other Place, and we miss interacting with our many friends and clients at their homes, office spaces, or in the community. So, we've made a plan to take on a few of our clients and their home offices temporarily, which will allow us to be more creative and flexible during this time of COVID-19 restrictions.\nIf you know of someone who could benefit from a creative office makeover, we can make a big change!\nWe are a 501 c non-profit organization, and we have always been in need of donations. Please consider a tax deductable donation to The Other Place whenever you can. As always, if you need to give us a small gift that you know we're going to really like because you're a true friend and you wouldn't give us that gift unless we were really going to appreciate it, then please make a donation in our name, or that of an individual in our family.

{"prompt":"Congressional Republicans pushed ahead on Monday on a U.S. tax code overhaul as a Senate panel considered the issue , but risks lay ahead with major intraparty disputes unsettled and President Donald Trump returning soon","text":"Congressional Republicans pushed ahead on Monday on a U.S. tax code overhaul as a Senate panel considered the issue, but risks lay ahead with major intraparty disputes unsettled and President Donald Trump returning soon from golf and an upcoming visit to Alaska.\nDemocrats and GOP leaders in the House and Senate have all insisted on moving forward with tax reform before lawmakers return home from the holiday break. The House passed a spending bill in the final hours on Friday night that would put lawmakers back in the office for Thursday and is aimed at delivering a payroll tax overhaul that was originally scheduled for early next year, but has been delayed by the GOP filibuster.\nDemocrats control the House while there are a majority of Republicans in the Senate after President Trump was re-elected on Nov. 3, despite the fact that the House is set to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet nominees when it convenes back from its recess next week.\nBiden is expected to take over office on Wednesday, after taking office, he will be able to begin to sign legislation to address a number of issues the U. S. faces, such as the pandemic. But Congressional leaders said they still have to agree on a key part of the tax bill and are likely to have to wait for Mr. Biden to complete his Cabinet selection process before moving ahead.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Monday that Senate Republicans are \"going to do everything possible to try to get a vote on the tax bill.\"\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the Senate had approved the language of a short-term spending bill.\n\"The committee is very much on track to come out with an agreement on the fiscal year 2021 appropriations bill. Unfortunately, that just simply isn't our path to tax reform,\" Mr. Grassley said during a conference call with reporters.\nCongressional Democrats have said they will make tax reform a priority in talks with Republicans as soon possible after the inauguration.\n\"The administration has said it's committed to doing whatever it takes to reach an agreement on the fiscal year 2021 bill, and it's in that spirit of giving the new president a clean bill of health that I am hopeful we will be able to get a fair and balanced compromise that is bipartisan in its approach \u2014 and that the president can support,\" Mr. McConnell said.\nCongressional Democrats continue to insist they will go back to work Monday with the tax overhaul legislation, but Republicans have said they need to have a deal with the White House first.\nRepublicans pushed to pass the bill before the break after Democrats had introduced a proposal to repeal President Donald Trump's individual income tax brackets. But negotiations fell apart last week after Democratic lawmakers expressed anger that Mr. Trump's tax cuts had failed to increase sales tax revenues. Democrats also want Mr. Trump to restore the top tax rates.\nWith the White House and Senate Republican leaders far apart on how best to proceed, President Trump could sign a bill that is not fully-fledged tax reform \u2014 and Congress will still be left scrambling to deal with the tax mess in his absence.\n\"We have some major work to do, and I think we do so much better when we finish it,\" Mr. McConnell said Monday.","token_len":655,"entropy":[10.163,3.3628,6.5552,5.1695,3.1526,3.7748,5.1076,1.0017,8.0576,0.0162,0.0324,0.3184,3.2847,4.6622,0.6796,4.6657,2.3663,7.7527,2.9537,3.6112,1.9817,3.0217,2.1598,1.597,10.6188,10.3057,2.4062,3.5182,5.9001,11.9821,0.4372,0.0016,3.2585,11.3568,0.0675,4.6178,7.4657,0.7937,0.0062,7.3565,7.0186,3.3616,5.0983,3.5138,4.0062,3.0792,2.6742,0.256,6.0385,0.1893,0.2048,25.7906,2.44,3.7778,1.1102,3.1497,1.0247,1.0063,1.1395,0.0918,2.1074,5.4722,6.0074,1.4224,4.5971,0.9662,1.3573,3.4052,0.6332,3.809,3.6645,1.3666,4.3313,2.2264,1.3462,2.6318,0.2785,0.7759,3.04,1.8275,2.7328,0.911,4.3524,0.1436,1.9899,2.3645,3.1253,2.775,3.5568,2.6222,4.4134,2.4083,1.3266,5.7015,5.661,0.8913,0.785,0.9814,5.5788,1.1716,5.9697,1.7541,5.3463,7.3131,0.0692,5.4171,1.4994,8.6399,0.4018,3.9414,1.8908,4.9781,5.4967,1.6476,1.2258,4.1111,0.3941,0.5992,3.0695,0.4691,1.701,1.3693,0.8508,1.492,2.0268,3.5065,5.4998,0.4825,0.2659,24.3669,6.724,1.1732,1.2748,6.1605,7.4534,0.9179,3.5111,4.6128,0.4079,1.4139,1.0564,0.1846,0.0632,7.7325,3.5938,2.2972,3.6576,4.189,0.4461,0.0074,2.153,1.7492,0.0005,5.783,2.0167,5.2062,2.1707,2.0412,0.2958,1.9765,2.1207,2.5521,4.1181,0.0252,6.9879,5.3062,3.7706,0.005,10.3372,1.2748,3.6438,4.5842,2.8171,5.537,3.9486,2.5436,0.0005,8.566,4.9752,2.0899,1.6375,1.6427,0.4777,0.0855,0.365,13.8382,0.0026,2.3741,0.9475,0.022,3.8375,1.7608,7.043,1.663,5.3087,1.2537,3.2424,4.5605,0.4752,4.5202,8.4226,2.2259,1.9634,4.259,0.024,4.4327,4.9933,3.6871,1.8894,2.6154,4.3488,3.161,2.4739,0.0015,2.3309,4.3666,4.7895,0.0005,10.6283,0.0016,4.3348,1.5784,2.7136,0.0014,1.7996,12.0937,0.0258,10.1536,3.0167,7.7244,3.1495,3.0023,1.2642,3.6043,1.4858,1.6869,3.8498,0.2012,1.1283,6.13,3.1614,0.0553,0.2481,1.8991,1.4114,3.2531,3.3339,3.4686,0.0736,2.681,0.3958,2.7192,1.4741,7.6663,0.0066,3.2237,0.6524,4.539,1.0166,5.0647,2.9078,0.431,1.6244,2.2055,3.3558,2.0124,0.1383,7.6558,1.2028,0.0457,0.0958,0.0006,1.5249,0.3644,0.0067,0.016,0.0145,0.9302,2.29,0.8178,0.4984,2.9082,0.9089,2.7658,1.7978,3.3826,0.3146,3.1663,1.0567,2.5492,0.9868,4.3034,0.5231,1.1048,2.1749,2.8917,0.5807,1.4855,0.7946,0.3848,1.9227,0.4394,9.2189,5.4127,0.2665,0.1,0.3884,0.0012,0.1792,0.0404,0.0011,0.0004,0.036,0.6582,2.1104,1.4803,3.4804,4.5089,1.1565,6.2396,1.3959,2.122,5.9146,0.0693,0.2192,1.8032,0.2887,3.9543,0.9354,0.7588,2.227,4.9977,1.6592,3.7651,2.9796,2.6779,1.0152,0.4896,4.0344,3.0907,0.2971,3.1327,0.9339,1.0212,1.1893,4.5835,2.4597,4.7205,4.4433,0.394,2.7883,5.8501,0.2751,2.6715,6.7031,8.3627,2.6835,0.0005,7.2479,3.3562,1.8025,6.2525,0.0365,0.3814,1.5322,0.0003,0.006,0.2106,3.9879,0.2484,2.975,0.0049,0.7709,0.0966,0.4811,0.3487,6.8699,0.4016,2.3588,1.5267,2.139,0.6669,1.5283,5.1463,5.1604,0.2591,0.67,0.5774,2.1943,6.7297,0.5043,2.705,4.3776,2.6594,11.6723,2.6827,1.0744,5.2258,1.1285,0.8471,1.9651,2.1277,5.0825,1.6194,2.2549,1.8609,1.6254,3.646,0.0567,3.7226,3.4945,0.4905,0.2112,0.1065,5.3455,1.8249,0.0804,1.1342,1.8798,2.0876,0.3515,0.2589,4.0323,1.8751,1.1723,2.6112,0.848,4.7114,3.6039,1.9793,5.0419,5.2421,2.0052,6.6908,1.2052,1.6841,5.1038,1.9343,2.0962,0.3682,3.1215,4.9315,4.0811,3.6396,1.8641,1.4313,1.4153,0.1491,0.0044,1.7629,3.4799,5.1343,2.947,1.4707,8.0356,2.6861,2.1345,4.3548,3.1118,2.5074,2.1546,6.8484,1.7996,1.4944,4.1956,1.4787,1.7606,2.8697,0.6491,2.7689,0.0003,1.741,0.1195,0.6273,0.2569,4.3574,0.2901,2.0071,5.9866,0.0785,2.6681,2.2119,1.2155,5.6714,3.2454,0.201,0.7261,6.6693,3.9438,1.6212,3.5177,2.3302,4.0915,1.7117,2.032,3.0249,1.3918,1.7183,0.4812,3.7021,0.6655,5.1569,0.8893,2.1085,2.5583,1.1449,0.7465,0.0004,3.7369,1.3495,0.5081,3.5111,6.323,3.2657,2.1575,1.1161,2.4645,3.9233,1.4247,5.1279,3.857,3.8112,3.9663,5.5783,0.8267,4.6669,1.0445,2.8043,3.6515,5.4924,0.0151,0.0068,4.6752,4.9133,0.0341,7.0756,1.54,2.6595,7.1147,3.8922,0.3518,3.9258,0.2812,1.2892,4.5078,2.6962,5.5417,5.4678,1.8899,3.5486,0.0007,0.1019,1.8194,1.9831,3.2978,3.2069,3.6722,0.1067,4.1671,5.6929,0.6868,2.107,1.1456,4.5182,2.9917,4.3144,4.1996,0.0006,0.1502,0.1016,6.2545,0.9763,3.9934,2.4025,1.7214,4.3861,0.2155,4.5413,1.4209,4.235,0.0009,2.9543,1.4408,5.2529,0.2681,6.9959,0.7795,0.9049,2.9218,4.1959,0.005,1.4308,0.9656,5.2349,0.6625,4.1392,4.1805,1.4559,2.6376,1.5924,3.7011,3.7728,5.6941,6.3746,3.1964,2.2427,0.2693,4.9481,2.0378,5.9059,2.296,3.9046,2.5978,2.5818,4.0307,0.3416,4.6046,0.0169,1.0656,2.6094,7.7765,3.3268,3.3761,4.9389,0.1769,0.4377,2.213,1.9567,2.1489,4.0981,4.0002,3.9069,0.1092,0.0473,1.9583,1.0594,1.7838,1.231,1.1313,5.2797,6.3994,1.5428,1.7151,4.6806,0.4588,7.4416,3.2343,1.5644,0.7359,0.0004,1.376,0.1162,2.0945,0.7057]}

{"prompt":"Michael Cohen , one of President Donald Trump \u2019 s closest business advisers , said on Sunday he would testify on Tuesday to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee , as the panel investigates alleged Russian","text":"Michael Cohen, one of President Donald Trump \u2019 s closest business advisers, said on Sunday he would testify on Tuesday to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, as the panel investigates alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nIn an interview on Fox News Sunday, Cohen said he would give an unofficial statement under oath in front of the panel, whose chairman, Republican Senator Richard Burr, has suggested he could investigate Trump or anyone in his circle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the American people know whether we were briefed by foreign actors or not,\u201d said Cohen, the brother of Trump \u2019 s longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\nIn October 2012 I published an article entitled \"Muslims are on a religious crusade to dominate the World\" and the accompanying blog. That post generated a lot of debate, which is why it is republished on today's anniversary. I also had the opportunity to respond to what I consider to be a series of insults directed at me \u2013 the most recent being directed at me by a man calling himself \u201cDr.\u201d in an attempt to disguise his disdain for the Muslim\/terrorist complex.\nI apologize to those of you who may have been offended by my article and blog post, yet would like to believe that the purpose of my post was to clarify what an Islamist terrorist would do in a democracy. In the end, it was the latter that proved to be the driving force behind the attacks we now see in Paris.\nAs stated in my previous post, I was unable to find any published information or a single source that would prove that an Islamist terrorist would not be allowed to operate within the First Amendment and protections of free speech, which is what I was trying to do in my initial blog post. Yet I now see a man claiming to be a physician, call himself \u201cDr.\u201d and openly espouse Islamist terrorism in an open forum.\nOne of the people I have corresponded with via email since the post was published, \u201cDr.\u201d offered me the opportunity to write a response to his post. I wrote what I thought was a fairly succinct response, which also made reference to my own experience as a citizen of Israel.\nI immediately received a response from \u201cDr.\u201d calling my response \u201cstudishly simple\u201d and offering to do a follow-up to my blog post. I chose not to reply \u2013 not because I don\u2019t feel it is necessary, but I suspect that the same attitude will follow.\nSince then, I have received numerous emails from \u201cDr.\u201d suggesting that I do so, but I chose to ignore his suggestions. I believe that the last thing any of us need is another Islamist on this blog defending his terrorist views. While I am certainly entitled to my own opinions, I chose not to respond as the sole goal of my initial post was to clarify what terrorism does.\n\u201cDr.\u201d did not disappoint by using the first opportunity he had to claim his opposition to my views as to the treatment of Muslims by the U.S. as a reason for the refusal to \u201cbelieve\u201d me regarding my views regarding Islamists and their treatment of Americans.","token_len":655,"entropy":[9.6493,0.9697,5.3205,0.0299,4.3249,1.6948,0.0209,16.6208,8.4135,7.468,5.0223,6.1628,1.2246,0.7248,1.8336,2.8271,2.9605,2.9061,2.2738,7.1721,3.2478,3.6045,2.6882,1.1975,5.2537,0.0043,0.0176,0.0039,0.3071,0.9495,0.0202,2.5238,3.8591,2.5492,3.1641,2.8813,3.8859,0.3405,1.0035,0.0569,0.1141,0.3886,1.7854,0.1121,0.2668,0.4018,16.5777,1.4523,0.2821,1.6359,2.596,0.0782,0.5852,0.1919,0.2704,0.6409,0.658,1.2081,4.4839,3.3362,8.9196,2.7282,6.2653,0.1905,3.6915,2.5403,0.0005,0.4425,2.3002,1.7132,6.9817,2.6506,0.3755,3.0395,1.1396,0.589,0.0019,0.5136,1.9959,5.0421,2.1236,2.669,5.244,2.6144,5.3522,3.457,2.6684,0.5596,3.7672,0.9902,0.2509,6.3325,5.8278,8.8093,7.0897,5.0486,1.0087,3.3709,1.0872,1.0649,2.0291,2.5169,0.0534,1.4309,4.686,3.3406,2.7576,7.0076,2.6705,4.8715,4.4276,1.871,0.6086,1.489,3.0173,7.2971,2.4152,0.0697,0.7803,3.3608,6.7922,0.0701,1.4592,4.8338,0.2366,0.8458,3.1076,4.4972,1.3685,1.153,2.0261,0.206,0.7524,0.5343,3.465,5.2746,6.7845,9.1258,6.4612,1.1371,0.33,4.0152,1.0188,10.8805,4.2321,5.4888,2.3953,6.737,1.8601,1.0794,7.0278,1.2925,5.3186,2.4778,2.5226,3.387,5.2359,4.5555,2.9027,4.4647,3.713,5.7217,1.8722,1.6537,0.0072,4.9813,1.7773,3.494,3.0858,0.199,3.1204,2.1256,7.2717,0.4829,2.7017,7.4278,0.3308,9.6627,1.7257,2.5276,2.7439,4.562,2.1806,0.801,0.0677,5.8821,0.1582,5.4481,0.8192,4.5548,0.5214,0.0136,1.5625,4.7302,0.0156,9.2011,1.4117,0.3032,1.1917,7.3102,3.7815,3.2238,1.6421,0.817,3.2178,0.2135,1.1873,0.9278,1.3102,2.7399,5.9652,1.2182,6.3124,2.2096,6.3786,0.3084,5.425,4.9573,6.6637,2.2492,2.2716,0.046,9.0005,0.8814,7.1474,0.0912,2.5526,2.7967,8.0759,8.4989,6.7696,0.7519,0.8431,2.2713,4.5867,1.5548,2.1087,2.5371,0.0235,0.1611,3.0222,0.5963,1.1869,0.5565,0.385,1.1678,3.0668,2.1203,7.5886,1.7499,1.7134,8.6825,5.6273,1.3398,0.2076,4.3566,0.441,2.8454,5.9597,0.1006,1.4945,3.7159,0.7848,0.3697,5.2066,2.3487,5.7212,5.8125,2.9134,3.6418,1.862,2.0282,1.8015,4.4494,1.0133,3.2234,2.3811,2.8743,0.4483,2.4544,0.9078,2.7358,5.5529,1.3483,5.858,1.3636,0.1566,0.6152,5.6986,0.0843,0.2115,1.6932,3.4337,5.684,4.3079,1.9594,1.4252,2.7614,1.497,0.8785,3.237,6.0218,1.3714,0.8066,3.245,0.9613,0.5459,1.3054,2.6859,5.7649,0.0725,3.1389,1.2136,7.2064,2.7669,3.802,4.7533,3.8353,3.0365,1.5054,2.2956,3.8333,0.6629,4.3382,1.2138,0.3172,0.912,4.4525,2.2362,5.0321,0.4008,3.4631,2.4107,0.9124,7.4734,0.0995,3.5235,8.9656,0.9714,3.0842,0.0549,2.1106,3.6839,2.245,2.0502,1.3124,2.6157,1.7787,0.0054,1.7548,2.5584,0.7536,4.7946,2.7956,0.0954,0.1646,5.0977,2.056,4.7957,3.9922,2.7026,4.5139,3.0949,0.325,0.3354,1.1574,6.591,2.2624,7.7786,0.3554,2.4335,0.0662,0.2103,0.124,0.1796,0.0804,2.1672,5.7894,4.0428,0.0297,5.458,2.3196,2.9381,2.6145,4.6282,2.308,0.8589,0.8582,5.0806,0.9133,0.4063,4.0839,2.0153,2.6636,6.2307,0.002,0.0807,6.9847,1.5479,4.4454,1.8904,3.3041,0.8003,0.1711,1.9348,3.7692,0.058,0.8218,0.0582,0.2769,0.0268,7.8804,1.6028,2.0059,0.2661,0.0461,4.3666,1.1018,2.7419,0.5976,1.8083,1.6257,1.2669,1.6486,3.9977,6.1022,0.5414,1.7987,0.5143,1.0639,3.1895,5.078,1.2354,1.2672,2.4085,6.0908,4.2128,4.3385,0.0046,1.7663,2.6151,2.0621,1.793,0.419,6.0042,0.5912,3.5405,1.4873,1.336,1.7188,6.8044,3.4271,1.1605,2.2482,0.5115,1.9501,0.0229,0.0741,0.0303,0.0681,0.0159,5.4163,2.4739,2.9598,8.3258,0.0771,11.8965,10.2515,4.3856,2.6067,2.908,1.2735,4.8962,0.9594,3.8891,1.8915,1.932,0.8475,0.0046,2.9027,1.0934,3.7157,0.1116,0.6847,1.4425,5.198,2.2186,0.005,3.4665,6.7361,4.4025,0.8531,0.4673,3.7082,2.9949,4.0317,0.138,3.693,3.423,1.2799,1.8515,1.0067,0.3737,5.5584,6.3395,0.6691,2.6441,3.9527,6.181,2.2057,4.367,2.5644,0.7917,4.3591,1.4321,0.3095,0.7501,0.2203,1.7838,1.4816,1.4784,0.8973,2.3045,0.011,0.0615,0.0078,0.0338,0.0093,4.4966,0.2691,1.6723,3.727,3.0593,1.9124,2.7356,1.293,4.7793,0.8543,2.5702,2.41,4.7162,0.9983,1.6814,3.3286,0.5067,2.4552,5.8274,1.2276,4.872,2.2875,0.5019,1.5264,0.4589,2.8915,6.1433,8.1571,4.2532,5.5239,5.1183,1.4912,5.0973,1.8151,0.7475,5.4471,0.6493,2.2665,3.6205,5.6443,0.0378,1.272,1.5671,1.0969,0.5954,0.7531,5.2136,1.4361,0.003,1.7536,4.3929,3.4023,6.2856,6.4432,0.3109,1.2707,5.0028,0.711,1.8935,0.2684,1.7176,0.4288,8.9701,4.3675,1.8217,0.7025,3.7827,0.4386,2.0066,0.0274,0.0564,0.0249,3.9672,0.4645,6.1947,4.0887,5.1292,1.4996,5.1964,4.5147,1.9734,1.0088,0.3038,5.711,2.4944,6.8694,0.119,3.0941,4.8319,2.2542,6.7914,3.4163,6.4653,0.2473,1.7192,1.9056,1.3379,1.5913,0.0017,0.0076,0.065,5.5886,0.9798,6.4425,1.1295,2.6089,8.7131,0.6728,12.0953,0.1439,6.3754,0.0638,5.3217,2.3326,3.9167,7.3038,1.8747,1.317,3.7624,7.8927,1.9768,2.6199,4.2407,0.2784,3.819,0.5002]}
{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Susan Collins , a Republican member of the Intelligence Committee , said Democrats should be called again to testify about reports that their party and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign paid","text":"U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican member of the Intelligence Committee, said Democrats should be called again to testify about reports that their party and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign paid to get classified information.\nA GOP Intelligence Committee aide called Mr. DeRosa\u2019s testimony \u201cthe beginning of the end,\u201d adding later he would call Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Sessions, the attorney general, as well as intelligence officials themselves, to testify about the allegations in an open hearing, which he will call.\nMeanwhile, a Democratic official said the intelligence official\u2019 s testimony underscored Republican hypocrisy.\n\u201c The Republicans claim to be tough on Russia, but the Russians are not only invading Ukraine and sowing discord over the Ukraine probe, but they are now penetrating our elections,\u201d said Mr. Schiff. \u201c This is not a surprise to us. \u201d\nAt least one Democrat has been called to testify before the Intelligence Committee, but Republicans are resisting the calls to call the top intelligence official to testify, saying the comments that Mr. DeRosa made were unsubstantiated, inflammatory and dangerous.\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, warned Mr. DeRosa that he could face criminal charges, citing federal laws that say witness statements can be used as evidence in a defamation lawsuit.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, who has been closely involved in the Russia probe, did not immediately respond to questions about the new testimony on the Russian allegations.\nRepublican senators and Reps. also have been calling for Mr. DeRosa to testify, and Democratic senators said some felt the inquiry was running its course and no longer needed Mr. DeRosa \u2019 s testimony.\nSen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, one of Senate Democrats who has long been critical of President Donald Trump, said on Thursday he considered calling Mr. DeRosa and would continue to consider doing so., adding \u201c in the interest of national security \u201c it was \u201c important for him to testify right now. \u201c\nThe new testimony comes amid heightened speculation over whether President Trump would order a U.S. attack on Russia, after Mr. DeRosa told the board that Russia was interfering with elections. And Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, noted that Mr. Sessions \u2019 office was looking into a possible Trump administration move on Thursday, saying that \u201c we need to see. \u201d\nIf the intelligence department says you can \u2019 t see Russia hacking, we should expect to see Russia hacking, \u201d Mr. Rubio said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if he wasn \u2019 t going to do it. \u201d\nEarlier, Mr. DeRosa told the Senate intelligence committee that \u201c there are reports \u201d that the United States intelligence community\u2019s Office of

{"prompt":"North Korea said on Saturday that nearly 3.5 million workers , party members and soldiers volunteered to join or rejoin its army to resist new U.N. sanctions and to fight against the United States in","text":"North Korea said on Saturday that nearly 3.5 million workers, party members and soldiers volunteered to join or rejoin its army to resist new U.N. sanctions and to fight against the United States in the event of war with Washington. It is the largest voluntary army mobilisation since the Korean War in 1950-53. The government said more than 3.2 million volunteers were registered nationwide. The voluntary army will be made up of about three million regular soldiers and the remainder from reserve forces, it said, without disclosing their number. The army would also mobilise an additional 200,000 people it called \u201cthe army of the people.\u201d The new policy also called for members of the people\u2019s armed forces, the volunteer armed forces and the workers\u2019 armed forces to serve in the voluntary army \u2013 except against the interests of \u201callied countries\u201d. The new policy was unveiled with the aim of putting the voluntary army on a path for full employment by 2020 and building a self-sufficient army. North Korea\u2019s Ministry of Munitions said on Thursday it was expanding the force by about 35,000 soldiers to prepare for war with Washington, which Pyongyang warned could be anytime and anywhere. The decision came as the U.S. Senate prepared to vote on a new U.N. resolution condemning North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile missile tests and other activity. China, North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner, has threatened to cut off diplomatic ties with Washington over the new policy. A senior North Korean official urged the United States \u201cto stop all provocations\u201d and to \u201cremain on an equal footing with the DPRK\u201d over the new policy. South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister Kim Kwan-Jin welcomed the measures but said he hoped North Korea would not be drawn into a conflict with the United States.\nGov. Bill Lee had announced this week that he expects a bill to help fund the creation or expansion of a statewide nursing school to be included in the 2016 State Budget. Now he has changed his mind.\nGov. Bill Lee gave the green light to the creation of a statewide nursing program Friday during a discussion of education policy with the Board of Governors of Georgia\u2019s Board of Regents.\nThe new plan would ensure that the health care needs of Georgians would be provided by nursing professionals and not by nurses who may come from other states to work in Georgia.\n\u201cWe need a nurse in each school, every day and everywhere,\u201d said Bill Lee, Gov. \u201cWe also need to train nurses with the state\u2019s best and brightest. In doing so, we can ensure the safety and health of our residents in our schools and hospitals, ensuring the security of local communities and ensuring that each state has the nurses its communities need. \u201c\n\u201cI am pleased to say that the Georgia House of Representatives is on board with legislation that would move us closer to our goal of statewide nursing,\u201d said Rep. Lee Henry \u201cBut like all legislation \u2014 whether it passes the house or Senate \u2014 we have to go to the governor to get the nod to become law. We hope to get the help of our leaders. \u201c","token_len":656,"entropy":[8.278,4.1599,1.4524,1.9383,1.1417,8.6455,3.5032,3.8995,0.9293,0.0676,6.3301,3.851,12.024,1.7976,0.3544,5.9298,9.0528,0.7737,2.8771,5.6367,5.2794,0.3249,3.8592,3.0049,3.2416,6.1647,7.3819,2.5023,0.0034,1.3962,0.1135,0.1276,3.1775,3.6007,1.5902,1.8345,2.8693,5.2649,0.0639,2.5118,1.0001,3.9075,0.0981,2.8156,2.3158,7.9529,0.2049,4.9247,3.5018,1.1129,1.3151,6.1304,3.2459,4.0106,0.5784,1.6266,0.6413,1.8019,0.0562,1.7311,2.1148,2.9519,1.3653,0.5426,2.679,3.7771,1.0476,3.0464,0.0127,2.264,0.7366,2.5178,0.0079,5.1846,1.8044,4.5077,6.3426,1.166,2.1817,6.5402,0.956,3.4973,1.6205,4.156,0.0277,0.0886,2.3413,6.0964,0.6975,5.1207,1.7021,1.1447,4.2454,4.5193,4.0104,5.0269,1.9544,1.7018,2.5359,0.2368,2.78,3.3342,3.5991,2.9814,4.0595,0.2585,1.7164,1.8298,5.1747,1.8893,6.873,0.001,5.4765,0.5778,4.2503,0.0556,0.0018,3.1932,6.7996,4.8331,14.6046,6.5573,3.1044,3.887,0.4057,1.2588,3.3062,4.011,7.3076,6.9576,1.5834,4.3307,5.0788,3.8918,4.24,0.0659,5.8865,0.8822,0.4274,6.6677,5.8781,6.99,4.6706,1.6814,0.0327,3.086,3.185,7.1747,3.6294,0.1293,0.5551,1.4884,6.7513,2.6788,0.4753,7.7203,0.101,0.3167,4.8919,1.4314,1.5137,7.0271,0.1452,6.9476,6.4703,6.7864,1.2983,6.9345,0.0205,13.5799,0.0547,3.2014,5.2208,2.8541,1.9822,4.9212,2.0153,1.5551,2.2304,0.7061,2.3914,4.3277,4.8144,1.2234,3.5701,0.0712,5.0877,2.3239,6.1391,0.0499,1.6236,0.8157,1.0223,4.9163,4.9578,3.3058,1.7007,1.2067,2.4667,5.9761,1.3344,6.2357,0.0093,1.6002,0.9049,1.8244,7.0767,0.0937,7.0329,1.398,0.188,3.8729,0.0173,9.6627,0.1435,1.9476,1.9901,3.657,2.0487,1.5866,5.48,0.8612,3.8585,2.3223,3.2347,5.573,0.2179,0.0225,1.9898,2.1263,6.4557,0.5823,2.0835,1.3521,0.7377,1.9193,2.9299,5.4975,5.9374,1.3309,2.9365,12.1713,5.0897,2.1282,0.698,1.464,5.87,2.3262,1.6095,1.389,1.7652,0.0004,0.7147,0.1746,5.9563,5.0312,0.3141,1.6297,0.2899,0.9874,3.4933,2.3799,0.0005,0.0443,0.0141,1.1433,2.7128,0.5203,0.0362,5.205,0.1986,0.0135,3.5284,0.0885,5.9525,1.5244,1.9748,3.3306,6.243,0.8416,4.57,1.8343,3.5754,0.0136,0.9684,0.0246,0.0245,2.9146,0.1384,0.004,0.1779,1.9153,3.5967,0.6058,3.2096,0.3197,3.9018,1.597,0.1567,2.6403,3.0444,0.8006,4.0046,1.6202,0.5515,3.6123,2.9295,3.6079,0.0813,0.3989,6.0114,1.3861,1.4604,0.1146,5.5517,0.5897,0.3431,2.8864,3.3387,3.8486,0.0001,0.5588,4.4199,1.1619,2.0828,12.1361,0.1553,5.6202,0.0111,3.144,4.4858,2.9673,0.073,0.3075,1.192,3.9979,0.398,5.6609,6.3189,1.2402,1.9851,0.6388,0.3072,5.1522,0.2705,0.9325,0.4907,0.0417,3.7383,2.4308,2.533,3.3592,0.1269,0.1082,4.9168,0.9939,6.8716,0.1411,6.0501,3.001,0.6902,2.4927,2.4526,3.7245,0.0824,0.5144,1.7271,3.0617,4.9984,0.2413,1.8034,1.803,0.8484,0.749,0.2217,0.0052,0.5572,3.087,13.8031,1.9858,6.6961,8.4379,5.7039,3.9896,4.7722,0.3675,0.2728,1.0616,6.3756,3.2052,6.3905,0.7284,7.8616,3.3696,0.5519,6.8217,6.2874,2.1834,0.0043,1.3619,8.6544,9.735,2.9634,2.6811,3.2677,5.9878,0.1562,0.432,4.463,2.8281,1.6676,0.7111,7.8509,3.5981,2.0275,4.9746,0.4408,0.1701,0.9134,1.3333,3.8164,0.0503,0.4135,0.0796,6.4815,2.0484,3.6898,0.0266,0.9973,1.2606,3.6891,0.2967,0.5074,2.5774,0.3227,4.6591,6.8908,4.5333,0.4781,6.3407,2.2441,6.03,1.7639,1.7539,2.0298,7.0665,0.0283,1.4596,0.6411,5.5956,6.5934,3.1288,0.3861,3.7356,0.0158,2.9198,0.0022,0.3391,1.505,1.7718,3.4591,3.0796,2.3213,5.6321,0.6885,2.0918,4.6908,0.6403,4.7926,0.0935,6.4623,0.0065,3.3538,0.309,3.7981,1.6202,4.6106,5.4145,2.0245,3.5902,0.7414,6.6795,2.4576,4.991,5.1159,0.5387,1.5435,0.6728,4.2823,2.9779,1.2045,2.4355,0.4998,0.8637,5.8567,1.7858,6.8689,2.6947,2.3263,4.2416,2.5605,5.0144,4.969,2.2088,3.8781,0.7443,3.3041,5.565,2.0661,5.7214,3.7714,1.3657,3.6995,0.0453,0.5617,5.3493,0.0933,9.6456,0.0329,7.8639,4.9359,0.1236,1.2528,5.92,1.5791,4.5503,1.4405,5.1512,5.6764,2.3141,0.1328,2.3995,3.2708,0.2399,1.7039,4.8285,5.4473,0.0982,0.0901,0.6557,2.3035,2.8743,2.488,2.7312,0.982,1.7455,0.1102,1.2247,3.1223,4.4797,2.1734,2.9925,1.059,1.7197,1.866,6.1526,2.0723,4.5652,0.3443,7.0866,2.9131,0.7638,2.2394,1.2807,5.8481,2.9092,1.1818,1.0899,8.5374,6.4577,6.8057,0.7546,0.9777,4.4813,0.1752,3.925,1.9919,0.2346,3.7571,2.1784,2.7719,0.7033,3.7945,0.2724,1.4437,2.8479,4.4276,0.6354,0.1143,2.6138,3.5818,3.6988,0.1173,4.875,1.0205,2.1119,6.5165,3.2539,1.2871,0.1257,3.3502,0.5239,0.179,8.0768,0.9371,3.2231,0.8449,2.8136,2.9639,2.732,0.0024,5.1936,9.9698,5.6594,0.1782,6.9691,6.0754,2.3041,4.8409,7.5132,4.3952,0.4843,5.2915,1.0376,5.1324,0.2853,5.7198,0.4671,1.8566,2.3234,0.2187,4.389,2.0506,0.465,3.5781,2.268,1.7055,2.7802,7.179,3.3834,5.0099,1.5118,0.2893,2.8641,4.7876,1.7744,2.5861,2.0376,5.8568,1.1478,2.2295,5.6367,2.4123,3.0837,0.2065]}
{"prompt":"Romania s senate approved on Wednesday part of a judicial overhaul criticized by the European Commission , the United States and the country s own president as a threat to judicial independence . The bill","text":"Romania s senate approved on Wednesday part of a judicial overhaul criticized by the European Commission, the United States and the country s own president as a threat to judicial independence. The bill is designed to give the government greater control over the judiciary and to put greater powers in the hands of the head of the powerful Romanian Public Prosecutor, who oversees the courts. This is similar to what has taken place in other countries facing financial downturns. The bill will give the president the power to call the current senior prosecutor to resign if the government believes he or she has violated the independence of the prosecution. Once the new law is approved by the final legislative vote, the bill will also include changes in the judiciary that will require a referendum. As an example: in cases involving politically sensitive cases, judges must be elected by Parliament instead of being appointed. Romania passed new laws to address judicial independence problems in 1999. In July 2004, Romania passed a law that allows the head of the Public Prosecutor to step in if a judge considers a case politically sensitive. The Romanian Parliament voted last year to create a new board with the exclusive authority to review judicial decisions and the president was to appoint the board s members. The new law has already been approved by the Romanian Parliament and will be referred to the Constitutional Court later this year for the last steps. On Wednesday, Romania s Senate approved a measure that will require the head of the Public Prosecutor to refer politically sensitive cases to the Romanian Supreme Court, instead of being transferred to a lower level of judicial authority. The Senate also approved a bill that provides for the creation of a new board, with exclusive authority to review decisions for political cases. The Romanian Supreme Court, which has been criticized for its inability to act independently, will need to reject the decisions of the new board. But the president will be able to intervene even in those cases, and refer them again to the Romanian Supreme Court if the judges refuse to reconsider them. Both committees approved the final approval of the legal overhaul in a meeting at which representatives from both parts of the government also attended. The Romanian government is pressing for changes to the judicial system that will allow it to have greater control over the judiciary. The country was hit hard by the financial collapse, with an ongoing economic crisis that has sparked protests against President Traian Basescu. Some analysts fear that the new law could hinder the fight against corruption and that it might undermine freedom of speech and of assembly. ($1 = 0.7353 euro) (Editing by Alan Johnston) Reuters staff correspondent in Bucharest Danica Curciu and other correspondents contributed to this report.\nFor the second straight day, the National Weather Service issued a heat warning for portions of southern Minnesota, including Rice County.\nOn Wednesday, the heat warning was issued between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. However, the warning is over now as temperatures have cooled off to the mid-70s, the NWS said.\nThe heat advisory means that people are encouraged to stay outside only in shaded places, drink plenty of fluids, and to monitor for symptoms of dehydration.\nThe National Weather Service had originally issued the heat advisory for the same time period. However, it was lifted Tuesday due to the cooler temps.","token_len":656,"entropy":[6.8072,9.599,13.9307,6.2377,3.8759,3.731,8.173,0.1056,0.7607,7.5459,4.4649,9.6569,0.2393,1.8749,2.6419,1.5959,2.0784,2.1796,3.4367,0.5369,0.4406,1.7925,7.2991,12.043,5.0363,4.4951,2.7847,1.9754,3.5561,0.0794,8.2639,0.1537,0.3843,2.7967,3.6539,2.9534,4.1711,0.0407,3.3279,1.5373,3.0608,3.0035,1.9162,0.0647,1.4133,0.6614,1.4024,2.0302,4.7844,3.3699,3.932,0.998,0.3755,0.0121,0.0011,1.0688,4.6584,0.0196,1.0341,7.5569,6.7022,8.7631,1.4238,2.4096,2.3526,3.2197,0.9296,3.9858,0.4675,5.84,1.9372,4.7923,0.0227,1.7482,2.8177,4.4114,0.0161,0.3617,2.0532,1.7157,8.2055,6.2397,7.3878,0.0214,1.0076,1.982,1.8111,2.7627,2.9976,0.6734,2.5546,1.4984,0.7062,0.0717,5.2118,2.2668,7.1836,7.3431,1.5282,2.0468,4.7368,2.508,1.6827,2.826,4.9138,1.4183,1.8911,0.0201,1.411,1.7169,1.1172,5.6005,0.4941,0.4274,7.4469,0.614,7.1715,0.9065,2.8866,4.0986,0.5613,2.094,2.4585,0.563,7.5454,3.5226,4.5923,0.421,0.9325,3.6145,0.4959,3.7252,3.3543,4.0529,3.3512,0.7583,3.5024,3.0605,1.6819,3.8354,2.1106,4.4541,1.9567,5.3167,4.294,1.1395,4.3765,3.5492,5.0667,1.6521,7.5974,1.481,1.5591,0.452,3.4506,3.495,1.0238,3.3249,1.3736,7.8816,4.2977,0.0366,3.2924,1.2543,3.2534,4.2548,7.2818,4.5083,1.4952,2.5181,4.247,5.44,0.5712,7.1613,1.1565,5.4923,1.4265,2.3587,4.1749,3.4047,0.0831,2.4709,2.5139,0.8295,0.3822,1.1486,3.4583,1.2234,2.7868,0.0023,0.5689,3.7607,0.1208,0.5823,4.8969,3.9473,2.051,1.718,2.2145,5.1894,2.5789,1.3814,6.6668,0.0325,0.4717,1.2332,4.0378,3.545,2.7668,4.7772,1.2111,0.1176,4.6782,0.5314,1.2446,7.8944,3.8209,1.3306,6.7867,2.3034,0.145,3.5738,2.1446,2.224,2.1309,3.8492,2.9643,5.3436,4.1153,2.6779,1.0709,2.2681,11.2631,4.2429,0.8125,1.1415,1.6629,1.5759,3.2814,3.0345,0.9854,1.4275,0.3284,0.6035,2.1292,1.1725,1.7326,2.4807,0.8074,5.4724,0.1055,0.4137,1.8914,0.1195,5.2847,0.1801,0.2865,3.4981,3.3916,6.5704,6.9277,1.0102,5.0459,1.9578,0.3307,2.6082,2.0157,2.6595,0.4889,1.1668,3.5551,1.0922,1.5887,3.5738,0.7859,1.3878,0.0084,0.1208,1.5486,0.0207,0.3174,7.6625,10.1155,0.0126,0.0831,0.2473,0.4592,4.9443,2.3224,0.0476,2.1388,5.5722,0.0037,1.7724,4.9538,0.255,1.4241,2.5655,3.9552,1.5087,3.8727,1.6017,0.2232,0.8589,2.6174,1.5422,0.5239,0.7244,1.1668,0.7498,4.8388,0.8009,1.0668,3.3858,0.0062,0.5204,1.2367,4.4973,3.2411,2.1768,7.3111,1.192,0.4679,0.9635,3.5134,4.5645,3.3276,4.5456,0.8177,1.0078,4.6106,1.5505,0.011,3.047,1.0347,2.0327,2.2163,2.2237,0.9793,1.457,4.4498,0.0079,4.0167,2.7213,0.8412,2.0573,5.065,0.3743,7.383,1.0085,8.0302,0.2036,1.0066,2.0573,0.5657,1.6515,5.1504,1.1664,3.8131,1.815,2.1188,0.4582,0.0286,5.421,5.8913,2.9987,4.1247,0.1245,2.1331,2.386,10.7169,1.8552,6.8225,1.2131,0.3455,3.47,0.4352,0.0098,1.9528,1.493,4.7269,3.7693,0.3369,5.2159,2.2022,0.1617,5.7938,6.9752,1.7478,0.6465,5.6713,5.5958,0.2101,0.295,6.659,1.3537,2.4499,2.3632,3.6426,3.5518,3.107,4.4103,0.8371,2.1705,7.6301,0.1747,0.1487,2.6978,4.8518,3.1798,0.3805,1.2315,4.5849,2.1638,2.2785,5.8165,1.3867,3.484,0.7167,0.4962,3.0887,0.2123,1.6867,1.1054,1.5812,1.5514,0.0963,4.1825,1.2145,1.1284,0.0413,0.6005,0.5467,0.8838,1.3968,3.7079,5.0292,3.1484,1.5726,0.226,0.9428,1.0753,3.2707,3.0978,2.3471,4.5822,6.6967,3.493,0.7832,2.9181,1.0732,6.3719,3.0006,3.5947,3.1839,3.0169,0.002,0.0399,0.0012,0.0011,1.6449,5.1903,2.8298,4.1351,0.5309,0.9621,2.7498,0.8105,1.3244,5.8236,1.1189,6.2409,0.1081,0.2371,1.2807,3.6626,1.1645,3.5478,3.9487,7.1931,0.0499,2.0631,1.0458,5.787,2.9397,0.3651,12.5816,0.0234,0.0063,0.8935,0.0,3.3231,5.9189,4.5791,0.0967,0.656,3.38,0.1032,0.0033,5.3992,5.7981,0.6142,8.4046,11.5047,8.6137,5.6418,1.5891,0.0001,7.1648,4.6742,7.4287,4.1136,3.5011,2.8563,6.98,4.3235,0.0003,1.0631,0.0801,0.0034,0.1109,0.0636,1.5292,12.6011,3.34,4.4308,1.6557,2.1297,0.3716,1.5319,4.9075,8.1313,0.0317,3.3108,0.8627,5.8118,3.7392,0.835,7.5263,0.0017,2.49,13.2433,1.6116,2.7518,11.117,1.3661,1.2225,1.8441,3.9115,1.7202,0.4185,0.9564,5.1677,2.9751,1.3361,1.449,7.4687,2.7275,1.4407,0.0005,0.0001,0.0489,0.1336,2.1725,2.3044,0.275,0.1708,0.0003,0.0008,0.6762,7.0477,0.0344,1.3279,4.7571,3.0008,6.9364,4.7077,3.738,2.0854,2.0994,3.837,2.8799,3.2572,2.2844,3.7537,0.1914,3.076,0.0116,2.2897,2.8736,2.8895,0.0361,0.3004,0.3822,0.8222,1.9183,2.8019,3.1979,5.2036,0.9235,4.4625,2.6054,3.5004,0.0464,0.754,3.6258,8.2496,2.131,10.4205,0.0753,5.4941,1.4662,10.3521,2.5255,0.0219,2.5662,1.3239,0.3496,4.9624,6.4856,1.9893,7.4178,0.6712,2.6189,0.7423,0.8815,1.7864,1.6194,0.0418,0.0049,5.1633,4.1859,0.8185,1.41,0.7709,0.7374,0.9235,2.1671,6.0744,2.0847,0.7623,2.16,2.302,0.0332,2.0088,1.8711,3.9387,5.0518,4.2868,0.0067,2.1611,6.0848,4.0617,0.0992,0.8142]}
{"prompt":"The man accused of tackling U.S . Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and breaking his ribs as he was mowing his lawn pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge , a court","text":"The man accused of tackling U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and breaking his ribs as he was mowing his lawn pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court news release said.\nJesse Jackson, the man who has been cited in the past as President Barack Obama\u2019s chief racial adviser, died at the age of 81, CNN reports.\nA man accused of attacking Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at his home broke his ribs during the assault and is jailed pending trial.\nIn response to a recent blog post I wrote a reply here, regarding the notion that the U.S. is the most \u201copen\u201d democracy in the world. This post attracted some criticism for being a bit \u201cjaded,\u201d and I thought I\u2019d bring it to my readers\u2019 attention to illustrate my understanding of \u201cbeing open\u201d to ideas, and to the world beyond your comfort zone.\nI came to this blog in an attempt to expand my understanding of the social justice movement, and was surprised to find a blog for which \u201copen-minded, thoughtful\u201d was not a descriptor. There were a few exceptions to that assertion, and I think that was because the site\u2019s editor, Joi Ito, was able to articulate a perspective that was beyond \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d and a good deal beyond \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism.\u201d\nMany of me think a strong, conservative, Republican government is necessary to protect the interests of the American people from leftist ideologues. The problem, I think, is that the libertarian notion of freedom, with which we\u2019re usually not familiar, (i.e., freedom from government), is not always compatible with a strong government. (This is true not just for conservatives, but also for libertarians.) On the other hand, with a strong government comes a host of social issues that can be quite troubling to the libertarian ideology that underlies this blog: government ownership of enterprises, regulation of private enterprise, government-mandated religion, government-mandated morals, and a host of other issues.\nSo, I think there are two issues here. First, the idea that government should not be strong enough to protect the interests of its citizens can be a dangerous ideology. We can use the liberty of the people to fight for good (and even terrible things); but then, we need to think about what that means for the liberty of our government.\nAnd second, it\u2019s a bit of an oversimplification to label U.S. society as \u201cmost open\u201d to ideas. Many Americans, whether libertarians or conservatives, can be quite closed minded about, say, religious freedom. There are a wealth of beliefs or customs in Western Civilization that our society does not permit, and I can\u2019t say that I know that everyone believes or practices those beliefs or customs. That makes the United States society a bit more \u201cclosed\u201d than many others\u2019 that I would classify as more \u201copen-minded;\u201d but I think we take our constitutional rights for granted, and that they are an important element of keeping our society openminded.","token_len":656,"entropy":[7.0119,5.3594,0.2151,8.8234,7.2136,0.4151,0.0374,0.0748,4.2828,3.2825,0.0009,2.2973,0.0332,2.8617,6.0344,1.5226,5.1377,4.9099,0.5541,1.9116,8.3478,0.4554,2.6181,0.0445,6.1043,1.4391,0.0009,2.5156,2.0632,1.2893,2.293,1.1629,2.8489,0.0782,2.3326,3.0169,2.6859,8.3456,0.2019,0.2703,0.0171,0.2192,26.0268,0.0202,3.9992,0.8951,3.4437,1.5626,2.0104,3.7276,0.9138,7.6452,2.9314,1.8894,2.9361,4.3896,8.1873,1.7035,0.0036,15.6653,8.394,3.1538,4.2105,9.1462,4.9213,0.3024,7.9321,2.7296,1.2395,1.3969,0.0055,4.7538,2.5535,5.6891,2.8131,0.1477,0.7277,10.9741,4.1972,2.4706,0.0038,3.3689,3.625,0.0025,0.2492,0.0012,0.3093,0.0095,6.2377,1.7224,0.8256,6.8237,0.3472,0.2514,2.8346,2.1415,4.4598,2.2122,2.6913,9.0862,3.876,1.4334,1.5665,0.8375,4.3218,5.3645,0.3161,2.0856,5.8847,5.9305,0.1378,8.4276,0.5386,6.5294,7.1428,6.4446,1.0441,8.1175,0.8594,7.6022,0.3098,2.0424,3.3659,0.001,0.0023,0.0093,2.7285,3.3772,3.0739,15.4397,4.2598,7.093,2.2992,5.5894,5.1561,0.7985,0.0927,0.1383,1.8483,4.0803,3.0008,7.8858,3.3128,2.5319,2.2704,1.9642,2.2342,2.6204,6.5318,0.249,6.3921,4.9592,2.2001,6.5553,5.6722,2.1481,2.3983,3.6777,1.4122,10.1328,4.6678,0.4266,4.287,1.0858,3.1722,3.1672,3.138,3.0713,1.1855,6.0957,2.7645,6.2944,2.528,7.995,0.4297,2.9038,0.3946,6.8612,2.3978,1.1193,0.0958,2.8623,5.5111,2.678,2.0774,2.3937,3.6474,4.33,6.3587,7.1016,5.77,0.0884,0.2937,0.7622,1.8962,6.0251,1.1025,1.4954,2.3729,3.4368,3.2714,0.4834,0.0525,6.2087,0.8005,0.9384,0.1201,1.4415,6.1597,3.037,1.527,1.4225,0.9378,4.804,3.5968,0.8984,1.4027,3.4422,3.8143,6.0377,4.78,6.1413,0.1931,5.2021,8.6704,0.2301,4.7958,6.6216,2.0747,0.3052,4.1812,1.6497,2.538,6.8305,0.7883,4.5697,2.0114,2.1418,1.1979,4.7785,1.8323,2.7798,8.3953,0.5522,2.0341,1.396,2.6759,1.9329,3.4456,1.6618,2.3532,5.6261,4.973,0.9008,0.293,6.5586,2.0258,6.9253,5.0289,7.9077,0.7979,0.4124,1.5381,4.8365,0.0133,4.6116,2.087,6.372,0.9228,1.6654,5.081,4.0262,0.0167,7.9027,0.1743,0.7104,2.3241,0.474,1.6373,1.0078,4.4932,5.4225,3.9738,2.7668,1.7142,0.0163,7.0909,5.7736,0.0007,0.0066,0.8997,5.3091,1.578,0.9137,5.3233,0.8872,5.8705,3.6614,4.6312,5.1743,2.8882,5.2604,1.7691,6.2741,3.6573,1.4272,2.4317,0.8874,3.9168,1.1729,3.0118,0.0595,0.9611,1.6537,0.1074,2.8154,8.9381,4.8537,0.0167,0.0003,1.3929,3.2395,4.0979,2.3192,1.4352,0.7449,0.0415,0.3528,0.2319,1.7886,6.993,5.8399,0.3075,3.6434,2.7439,5.3495,3.9682,1.8384,7.0309,2.2877,3.0519,6.2165,6.9281,1.6526,0.1439,7.4852,3.9227,0.0096,0.0011,0.2163,3.274,1.5902,1.944,3.7101,0.8126,2.2895,4.7034,3.5161,0.0158,2.6005,2.5753,2.9755,1.0283,4.4758,3.2219,0.8412,2.8128,2.7942,1.5632,1.0077,4.0627,0.5266,0.2123,0.7273,0.1551,1.4925,2.0091,5.5549,0.2954,0.8322,0.0351,0.0059,5.2105,2.0103,0.5252,0.5334,9.3296,1.0569,6.7324,0.0017,3.9402,2.2475,1.3202,2.7668,1.0523,5.4561,5.4649,1.3923,1.9176,2.897,5.4766,3.7348,5.5434,1.4517,4.0193,7.6479,3.9565,4.5852,6.5389,0.5776,7.122,0.5364,3.9941,0.1816,3.2949,2.3401,0.3366,4.0329,2.7249,3.0863,0.0058,6.8844,0.2502,2.8019,1.4124,0.3419,0.0134,6.996,0.2153,1.3647,3.2175,2.8965,0.0021,0.2125,1.1354,1.2748,0.7553,3.5713,1.0083,1.9293,2.3768,2.8936,1.288,1.6488,3.735,1.8747,1.2077,0.7431,0.1289,2.0842,3.0131,0.3641,2.1856,2.2894,2.6966,0.9098,6.4401,2.1031,0.5547,0.6302,1.0038,0.4985,0.0155,3.7459,0.2568,4.633,0.7559,2.4175,3.348,4.3862,0.8608,4.6787,2.7659,5.2091,1.3907,5.4816,1.4059,1.3386,2.2206,0.6282,4.1455,1.2174,4.3636,5.7442,2.2891,4.0641,7.8814,2.6966,4.6658,1.8043,4.8052,1.6874,1.8038,2.5444,0.7687,3.0642,0.7572,1.8911,2.5692,0.9552,0.9833,1.1714,3.8757,0.1614,2.4623,3.1869,0.7951,1.3843,4.8373,0.5462,0.02,3.3216,3.5653,0.5787,0.0077,2.5531,3.4984,3.0093,1.8639,3.2266,0.0008,0.0118,1.5917,6.462,6.6273,0.0012,0.0021,0.0365,3.8828,0.5342,6.7902,0.0474,10.0245,0.7402,0.1133,0.0141,2.0704,0.0943,1.1639,5.1407,3.1532,2.5781,4.3608,3.0377,0.505,2.0013,0.061,5.1392,2.477,1.8775,8.4006,2.1114,1.1402,6.3444,1.4307,0.0268,4.8532,1.6384,1.4437,4.1248,0.7537,1.9405,7.9043,0.0043,5.2593,5.7274,6.9006,3.7495,5.421,3.8673,0.9471,6.0258,1.6019,2.4615,0.0608,4.5421,1.9651,0.7248,3.4664,3.7723,4.3891,0.187,0.0282,2.7418,1.1672,2.6576,4.4807,3.6483,6.1324,4.7954,4.965,1.9027,1.5259,0.3209,0.8388,0.0458,0.6257,3.8379,4.0118,2.1677,2.6623,0.006,6.7414,2.4897,2.4949,0.9507,3.15,0.0237,3.4631,1.131,0.0126,1.6456,3.0039,3.2979,3.7739,0.1885,3.3686,1.2275,3.8303,3.2404,0.1409,4.0349,2.8352,0.0066,0.1142,4.6503,0.0112,8.1769,4.988,0.7379,0.7993,1.6224,1.4544,2.9389,7.7679,3.0556,6.0542,1.8617,3.4666,0.003,1.7113,0.4666,1.9376,5.4327,1.0314,4.8527,0.4684,4.3558,0.5617,6.6819,1.4014,1.4169,1.4606,10.4053,0.4681]}

The poll also showed that 34 percent of voters prefer not to make their choice at the moment. Of these voters, 28 percent are men and 36 percent, women.\nMexico s Public Opinion Institute ( GIES ) conducts monthly polls since 1991.

We are going to do the right thing, to take care of the sovereignty of our people \u2026 and to build a great country and for us and for our children. \u201d\nThe elections in Mexico are always

{"prompt":"Chinese officials trying to hide dishonest spending with tricks such as throwing extravagant parties in private will be targeted in a sustained campaign to root out hedonism , the top anti-graft watchdog said on Monday","text":"Chinese officials trying to hide dishonest spending with tricks such as throwing extravagant parties in private will be targeted in a sustained campaign to root out hedonism, the top anti-graft watchdog said on Monday, as it said it had closed down nine companies, some with ties to top officials.\nChina's anti-graft watchdog disclosed on Monday that it had closed down nine companies over alleged corruption, some of which had links to top officials and businesses in areas such as steel and real estate. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a statement that it had closed down companies for a range of irregularities, including siphoning off funds, embezzlement, corruption and bribery. The cases were closed down and the individuals concerned will be punished according to law, the CCP announced on China's national day.\nChina's Ministry of Home Affairs and a unit of the country's top political body have ordered all state-owned banks to report on their staff' private overseas assets, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday (Oct 15), citing a directive issued by the ministry and the Politburo. The directive comes as the authorities continue their crackdown on so-called \"shadow banking\", which they have been trying to stop with a crackdown that dates back to 2011. The directive was issued on Friday but its details weren't specified, Xinhua reported.\nChina's central government is gearing up to crack down on a rising wave of corruption with new powers to investigate firms linked to officials and tighten regulations aimed at stamping out wasteful spending, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. \"From now on, corruption will be closely monitored and punished,\" Chen Yinglin, vice minister of finance and an anti-graft activist, said at a meeting with regional officials in Beijing, the Xinhua news agency reported. \"They must strictly control their expenses,\" he said. \"The expenses of officials cannot be used any longer to make themselves rich.\" Under China\u2019s anti-corruption reforms introduced in 2012, which gave prosecutors new power to punish officials of companies linked to officials and opened a window for them to raid their homes and office, investigations have turned up an expanding web of businesses and assets in the name of those linked to officials. This week investigators found a large collection of luxury watches in the company of Liu Shijie, the vice-chair of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, as well as thousands of paintings. Liu, whose company, Shuangliu International Group, has contracts with nearly every ministry, was detained in July following investigations into his links to Xi Jinping, the party boss.\nA report released by the World Bank found Beijing's local governments are the largest losers in the central government's attempts to curb public expenditure. According to the report, spending cuts are hitting the city's finances the most, as the city does not have any taxing powers. According to the report, while public spending in 2012 increased at a faster pace than public revenues, it is actually shrinking at a faster rate than revenues. According to the report, spending increased from 36 trillion yuan (US$5 trillion), or 20.5 per cent of gross domestic product, in 2009-10 to 44 trillion yuan in 2011-12, or 25 per cent of GDP.","token_len":658,"entropy":[7.3836,9.2245,0.012,6.1229,13.4127,8.145,5.8826,12.64,3.2897,0.0018,7.7891,7.9832,4.5405,2.9158,4.0344,9.2548,1.8047,5.8695,3.3019,1.5936,8.2601,1.5015,1.4387,6.0627,0.0413,10.1293,2.7722,0.641,2.0785,2.738,4.9074,5.9296,0.0024,6.0765,0.2618,3.1754,0.5261,1.5389,1.7803,3.3542,2.1913,3.4915,5.0639,1.3949,3.4929,7.1803,2.5753,5.2922,5.001,3.7311,4.7016,2.9146,3.238,0.0047,4.3619,1.8392,1.1855,0.1775,21.2439,0.9075,4.1101,0.0006,2.3467,0.0007,1.2141,7.9536,1.4012,0.6965,0.2823,1.202,0.3346,1.135,2.0268,2.2763,0.952,4.6467,3.1406,1.8801,1.5076,5.5528,0.6052,0.2828,1.3862,3.1986,0.0746,1.3289,0.422,3.142,5.7522,2.5694,6.9581,0.882,0.0012,5.9731,1.2704,4.5333,0.0062,0.5583,2.7239,7.4961,2.8918,0.5065,0.3515,0.0021,1.7217,2.8682,0.1691,0.5278,0.3941,0.9105,0.581,2.0465,1.7488,6.111,3.9103,4.578,3.8066,0.0019,4.5331,1.4992,0.2436,8.2884,0.0302,0.6904,2.9968,2.861,6.0631,0.0002,0.0002,0.4689,1.2658,3.5461,0.3764,2.3857,0.4505,2.9572,7.1799,1.4975,4.1524,3.2723,4.7505,1.5009,7.1365,6.8542,2.8198,0.5635,3.0479,3.227,0.0033,3.7957,0.8573,0.9872,7.9145,5.9642,2.2737,7.4812,0.2339,3.7587,0.3105,0.3622,0.241,14.2861,0.6962,4.8231,0.0014,6.7783,0.0367,2.0684,4.7432,7.4956,0.0867,0.6341,3.9116,0.0038,2.7177,4.078,3.2901,2.321,4.9326,2.5136,3.6304,0.663,0.234,4.133,0.6259,3.6198,3.3085,1.8436,6.982,3.3717,7.0507,7.2319,4.5897,1.3931,1.8867,3.0643,0.3367,0.0004,3.2565,0.0157,0.5581,1.2389,3.3579,6.206,3.8041,5.1912,2.9122,0.6607,1.3618,7.9593,1.2022,0.3168,0.4104,2.75,4.1178,1.1473,8.0239,0.0018,0.0001,2.7224,1.4557,2.8128,3.1698,1.8465,1.2958,5.0344,4.1682,2.5065,1.2155,0.1393,7.4667,0.0122,0.0006,0.9276,3.662,0.5847,2.0359,1.7372,3.6666,2.6658,2.6938,2.4927,0.0509,3.8076,4.1898,2.3567,2.2914,3.3163,7.2448,0.0886,0.2176,3.3336,0.4414,2.1171,5.1686,2.5423,1.4265,1.9128,3.0685,4.4032,5.698,3.2261,4.8827,0.0003,6.631,2.2556,0.9772,0.0023,1.5151,0.2488,0.4446,2.5756,0.5806,2.506,3.2507,2.3324,5.6602,0.0112,0.83,2.7215,0.006,0.0484,4.8997,5.0633,4.1517,0.0025,1.6399,5.0795,3.7196,4.5248,1.1321,3.8855,5.016,3.9501,0.0129,3.2563,1.351,12.2807,3.5148,5.3528,0.004,4.1462,0.1841,0.0436,7.4848,0.813,1.9391,1.9918,3.1453,0.2178,0.0025,0.8483,0.0068,0.755,0.869,2.7161,0.9954,3.1373,6.1805,1.3837,0.0465,0.487,5.0375,1.4622,0.6425,6.2805,0.3634,1.6264,2.8636,1.0782,6.328,4.9365,3.4229,0.0559,3.8686,2.9811,0.2966,2.9735,0.9768,5.1913,3.6423,0.0007,2.5572,0.0027,4.0368,0.3165,0.9991,2.6688,0.2278,2.5145,1.7467,6.9458,2.1995,1.1493,0.8299,3.0984,1.9694,1.4852,0.0022,1.1138,0.0127,0.3094,0.2149,1.8664,4.2917,3.8219,7.3293,3.2232,1.5832,6.0432,3.158,0.7695,0.6617,0.3749,2.0504,2.4745,8.1809,1.3814,4.7385,4.9697,0.4115,2.3465,6.8115,1.8145,2.2637,4.2715,5.4133,1.0719,0.7362,6.1392,3.3188,19.3972,7.6123,4.4366,2.4265,0.004,0.4143,6.5527,5.1257,0.5503,2.4199,0.1328,5.0191,4.604,4.5816,4.4359,3.1805,0.1652,4.205,2.3451,5.7689,3.0108,1.7549,0.0135,2.3904,1.7613,8.2095,2.3559,4.0309,1.4271,4.0056,0.0112,7.2642,3.7882,2.4212,1.9125,4.689,3.812,6.2155,1.6572,4.9806,0.863,4.6187,6.537,7.8448,0.0309,5.864,2.4532,5.2341,3.2015,1.8545,3.0949,0.0018,6.9418,3.1381,0.0201,0.9922,0.7056,5.2774,4.0385,7.469,3.5265,2.7464,4.1834,4.2314,0.0112,4.9164,4.1708,2.9738,1.8248,3.5984,0.5618,6.8404,3.7731,3.1874,2.6467,0.2749,1.5589,3.7498,1.6907,1.0996,3.1182,1.4756,3.6104,0.0839,0.0322,3.6247,2.0531,0.5039,0.0639,0.0391,0.7105,3.0613,0.0566,0.0094,4.8011,0.0206,6.0573,3.8931,3.2663,2.0929,3.8103,3.0264,2.6183,8.823,2.0822,5.9018,5.4656,4.628,3.0392,0.3867,2.1318,6.8465,1.0564,5.7529,2.3488,7.3272,1.8239,2.286,4.2501,1.2565,2.9546,4.2699,3.8747,0.8549,2.2301,5.1636,0.0827,5.5918,0.1365,1.5861,0.7389,1.8122,4.4368,1.244,1.8143,3.3965,4.8242,2.4877,0.8563,0.4413,5.2529,0.1511,5.0144,4.7867,1.9822,7.4367,3.456,2.0105,3.3681,2.1602,6.3977,1.4945,1.595,7.3876,0.7419,0.1229,4.7977,0.012,1.716,6.325,6.6442,1.3829,3.6328,0.0011,0.4274,0.3862,0.0793,5.8388,6.6376,3.0553,5.6099,1.6329,4.5699,0.5034,4.0979,4.6678,0.7312,1.1577,2.9628,2.3399,2.3136,6.522,0.0981,0.5645,3.6207,8.9042,1.6075,1.2464,3.7559,0.0019,0.4906,0.3383,0.0726,4.9532,4.2935,0.6622,2.1139,5.4445,3.3353,3.9269,0.7569,2.5291,1.5471,0.1617,7.4095,4.5629,0.4168,1.9028,3.1905,4.8602,3.7721,2.6788,0.2525,1.8563,0.4095,0.9149,3.9148,1.3834,3.3331,0.0015,0.3403,0.2318,0.0567,4.3478,4.5784,3.8216,6.0631,4.3199,0.0715,1.8228,0.4759,0.021,3.5148,3.4805,3.4868,0.7474,5.18,1.7647,1.8872,2.4592,0.0014,0.2541,2.5891,0.0491,0.0007,0.4031,0.4874,3.2997,2.5788,0.6211,0.2441,4.3338,0.3439,0.0064,3.3759,1.4994,0.0744,0.0186,0.709,0.7055,4.2235,0.7553,0.0005,0.2366,0.3976,0.4151]}

The center of the quake was near the town of Ezgele, but tremors were also felt in Kermanshah, the city in western Iran closest to the epicenter, CNN reported. At least 21 people were injured, state-run media said. The United States, which sent a team of rescue workers to Iran in the wake of the devastating 2016 earthquake that killed 40,000 people, said it was considering a mission to the region.\nThe U.S. mission will likely consist of both military and civilian experts, and will likely last several weeks, said a senior U.S. official. On Monday, Mr Trump said he planned to send both a U.S. and Iranian military contingent in Iran\u2019s earthquake-affected areas. Mr Trump added this week he might order sanctions to \u201cset the record straight\u201d and punish Iran for failing to help with a UN investigation into the Nov. 3 missile attack on a U.S. military base in Iraq that killed a top general of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.\nIran says an earthquake the magnitude of 6.0 hit Saturday, forcing hospitals to close and schools to shift their students to temporary shelter in the southern Iranian city of Kerman. The center of the quake was near the Ezgele district in the Kermanshah Province.\nThe earthquake struck at 07:30 local time at a depth of 6.0 kilometers at 13 kilometers northeast of the Ezgele district of the Kermanshah Province in southern Iran, the Center for Earthquake Research and Earthquakes in Kermanshah said.\n\u201cInitial reports indicate no casualties and no damage to buildings or infrastructure. Many families were sheltered under the shaky buildings,\u201d Mohammad Ferdowsi Gholam-Hosseini, spokesman for Gholam-Hossein Mohammadi Ejei-Saadoun, Kermanshah\u2019s governor\u2019s office, told Tehran News Agency by phone.\nHe said 10 teams of health workers had been dispatched to the earthquake-hit areas and were conducting rescue operations in five municipalities.\n\u201cFive schools have also been relocated to shelter as a temporary measure,\u201d he said, adding that all hospitals in these areas will also be shut down temporarily.\nThe epicenter of an earthquake around 7.3 on the Richter scale struck the northeast of Iran on March 30, 2016, according to the Joint Center for Satellite Measurement of Seismology. The earthquake hit at 7:20 p.m. on a Sunday evening, just a few hours after Iran\u2019s Parliament passed legislation that aimed to ease the US embargo on Iran.\nThe legislation was signed by President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday. He said that the sanctions imposed on Iran would be lifted completely and the country would not have to pay for uranium and oil exports if the sanctions were removed.\nIran\u2019s Central Bank

{"prompt":"Greece s Supreme Court will decide on Dec. 13 whether to extradite a Russian to the United States where authorities want to put him on trial for laundering $ 4 billion via a bitcoin platform","text":"Greece s Supreme Court will decide on Dec. 13 whether to extradite a Russian to the United States where authorities want to put him on trial for laundering $ 4 billion via a bitcoin platform operated by his company, the New York Times reported on Nov. 8.\nHowever, the court's decision on extraditing Alexei Navalny, who is facing extradition, is still pending.\nNavalny is the most prominent anti-corruption activist and opposition figure in Russia. His arrest on Nov. 17 under the Russian Investigative Committee's order sparked worldwide protests and the government of the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries declared the accused of poisoning Navalny a terrorist.\nA court in the United States confirmed his criminality and demanded that he be given up to the US authorities for trial. The verdict of the court states that Navalny allegedly organized a crime, stole millions of dollars and committed fraud, among other crimes.\nNavalny was arrested at the Moscow airport on Nov. 17. Russian authorities said that he had poisoned former Kursk Oil Company employee Felix Matveyev at a public meeting on Nov. 14.\nAfter Navalny's arrest in Moscow, the Russian police took him to the southern city of Sochi, where he began undergoing a series of tests. The results of the test showed poisoning.\nA Russian doctor involved in the analysis, who is also Navalny's medical adviser, said that he would soon begin the treatment of the politician, but this is still not clear.\nThe New York Times reported that Navalny could be detained for up to three and a half years, and he has to choose how to proceed with the case. So far, he has not answered and does not comment on the request for his extradition.\nIf the court agrees with the request of the US authorities, Navalny will face trial in Moscow. One option is that he will be sent to Russia, where authorities have said that they intend to use all the evidence at his disposal to prove his involvement in the attack.\nNavalny has not been allowed to visit in Germany after contracting coronavirus the day before his arrival in Berlin for treatment. He has not spoken about his case in the public yet but it seems that he has enough reason to be concerned after returning to Moscow.\nAlexey Navalny, who has become the most public figure in opposition to President Putin since the end of the Soviet Union, is the leader of the \"Young Turks\" movement.\nEarlier, the New York Times claimed that Navalny received nearly 1 billion rubles ($ 100 million) in donations from foreign sources. This money came from companies that did business with the oil giant Gazprom and other enterprises.\nIt is unclear whether the money came from individuals, as this is prohibited in Russia, or from organizations that made donations in the United States at an account registered in the Virgin Islands.\nThe New York Times reported that most of the money was delivered in cash, and Navalny did not

Taiwan is already considering a range of measures including the deployment of military forces and weapons systems, such as Patriot batteries, to thwart Chinese military moves in order to protect its national security, he said. The drills are aimed to stop China military moves in order to protect Taiwan, Taiwan s current president, Lee Ching-yih, reiterated to reporters on Friday.\nThe Taiwan Relations Act requires Taiwan to seek peaceful reunification through negotiations while Washington regards the island as the Chinese mainland s by extension in view of its relationship with Beijing. The Chinese military exercises are taking place a year ahead of the presidential election, which will take place on May 20. Since Chen won Taiwan s presidency in 2003, Taiwan has been conducting Chinese Air Force aircraft exercises with both China s northern and southern fleets as part of a military exercise, which is a common part of Taiwan s military buildup.\nThe United States, including a number of U.S. congressional committees, has said it is concerned about the military exercises while maintaining that the PLA Navy and People s Liberation Army Air Force conduct drills on a regular basis to protect themselves.\nOn Thursday in Washington DC, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Michele Bachmann, called on China to refrain from such military drills. China already is increasing its naval forces and deploying anti-ship batteries and other weapons systems to Taiwan. China s drills, however, could affect peace talks, Bachmann said. The U.N. General Assembly, which on December 9 unanimously passed a resolution calling for the PLA Navy to cease the practice of military drills, could not endorse the resolution, noting that it did not recognize China s official title of the PLA Navy and therefore it had no legal mandate to do so.\nOn Monday, China issued a statement to dismiss the United Nations General Assembly s resolution. According to the statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if the resolution is used to undermine China s legitimate authority or infringe upon its sovereignty and territorial claims, China will take appropriate countermeasures to uphold its rights and interests. The statement comes a day after the United States said that China s nuclear-equipped aircraft carrier will conduct a drills along its East China Sea coastline in June, a policy change that will complicate Taiwan s relationship with China if it takes place.

U.S. Travel Advisory has been posted at the embassy website urging visitors to be extra vigilant. This is the first alert on North Korea for South Koreans since 2009.\nThe United States has been trying to engage North Korea with sanctions in particular in an effort to get its nuclear arsenal down. Trump has said he would be prepared \u201cto use military force.\u201d\nChina\u2019s Ambassador, Sun Guo FANG, told reporters on Friday, that China made its best efforts to resolve issue on the Korean peninsula since that Moon came to power.\nSun said China hoped \u201cthey get as much out of China\u2019s support as possible\u201d and made their best efforts to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula.

Seven people died and the rest were injured in the accident that took place near...\nThe world is going crazy for the brand of the iPhone 5 and all the hype from Apple is on a high for every fan of their products. People can\u2019t seem to stop talking about the new design of the iPhone and if the new iPhone is actually going to be released, what\u2019s the difference between the new model and the iPhone 5? The new iPhone and the iPhone 5 are actually the same thing as far as features. They have all the features from the previous versions of the iPhone 4\/5 but they have a different design, they have a different size, and they have different screen sizes just as much as the previous versions. The most important differences you will notice between the new iPhone and the 5 will be in the design and the size of the phone, not in the features at all.\nThis is why I always say that you need to be a little careful when trying to talk about which phone you should get. You never want to make the mistake of only deciding on the design or the size without making sure you are getting the proper features and everything. You should never go shopping without having all the information you want to know about the phone. You need to stay aware of all the different models that are out there because they are constantly changing. They are always being updated so if you can find the current information about the phones before you buy one, it would be a good idea to do that. There is so much good information out there that will help you know what to do and what not to do when you are going to be deciding what phone is going to be the right fit for you.\nThere is so much information that can be found at internet sites like this one about what happens when you are looking at a new phone for your business. You will always have to remember to take a little time to get the information that you need. You might be able to find out some of the prices but you also need to know what else you need to know. Things like how long it takes to install the product, how fast the shipping is, and how convenient the installation really is. You may not want to get a phone that you have to have an IT person to help you with, but you also want to make sure that you can get the product to you as quickly as possible.\nThe best thing that you should really be doing when you are looking for new phones is to make sure that you are keeping yourself updated with all of the different facts that are available at the internet sites that are dedicated to help people like you with the information that you need. It would be the best thing that you can do to just keep up with everything that is going on, and you can always make sure that you know what is happening before you have to make a decision.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not remember much about a meeting last year with a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty last month as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian","text":"President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not remember much about a meeting last year with a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty last month as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\"At a certain moment, I would have thought about it (his meeting with Carter Page)\" earlier this year, Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. \"I'm not sure that all he had for me to give, but he had some very strange information about the Russians... I don't remember much of what he gave me. It was about a month ago.\"\nHowever, Trump said he remembered Page describing details of a meeting he held with former FBI director James Comey before becoming Trump's campaign manager in July 2016 and the time the alleged Russian meddling was discussed, according to a tweet from Fox News.\n\"It was probably in July or August. I saw it happen,\" Trump said on the South Lawn of the White House, during an appearance with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\"Some very strange information about the Russians by a former campaign aide, a very strange subject,\" Trump told reporters. \"He said there was somebody he had met that had this information and that I should take it seriously. We talked about a lot of subjects last July or August.\"\nHe added, \"I didn't really talk to (Federal Bureau of Investigation) director Comey, I talked with a candidate, with a campaign manager to my campaign. He never really had it, I never told him about it.\"\nThe special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into any help by the Russians in the presidential campaign and if people in the campaign conspired to undermine the Mueller probe by obstructing it, according to Republican sources.\nTrump said he has not talked about the special counsel nor his relationship with his former campaign manager with anyone in the current White House or the Justice Department about their investigation.\n\"Whatever he told me, I don't remember very much,\" Trump said. \"The fact that an old campaign aide told him some very strange information, which he said he had seen in the news, I don't really know what that means. It's a very strange story.\"\nTrump has refused to tell lawmakers under oath about his meeting with Page at Trump Tower in July, but on Friday he also said he was unimpressed by the special counsel.\nFormer President Barack Obama and Democrats say that Trump lied when he claimed in 2016 that he had never spoken about Russian interference in the election with then-FBI director James Comey, but did not see the evidence. The U.S. Justice Department said earlier this week that it would no longer use the term \"fake news.\" Law enforcement experts and the White House have cast doubt on reports that Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn acknowledged discussing intelligence failures with the Russians.\n\"The report that we received yesterday has a significant number of holes,\" Trump said on Friday. \"All evidence and evidence of any sort of collusion that we are aware of is circumstantial and the reports do not indicate that a collusion occurred.\n\"So we have to find out if there was collusion,\" Trump said. \"We were never promised any collusion. I have never been on anyone's collusion team. And it has zero weight with me.\"","token_len":664,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.4669,1.8901,2.0917,2.08,4.8315,0.0631,5.3803,5.1744,0.4772,4.5756,1.9537,4.2717,1.8632,1.6213,3.5474,4.3221,3.3507,1.6621,1.6097,5.9585,0.0413,3.3114,1.066,7.6332,0.2824,0.0004,0.5625,3.6512,1.6129,0.121,3.6676,0.7453,0.6207,0.0931,0.0463,0.3399,2.0765,0.1184,0.1736,0.1458,11.9592,5.5207,3.4492,3.4144,5.1922,0.9488,0.8717,3.6873,1.4049,2.7187,5.0322,0.8925,6.9256,4.7414,3.5461,0.6581,5.2782,1.1206,5.9148,9.7106,0.4701,0.9824,0.2818,0.4033,1.528,1.9397,2.3847,1.5264,4.4138,0.0097,0.5412,0.0643,0.004,0.0001,0.5828,0.9449,1.1456,3.41,0.4187,1.2304,2.0283,6.5254,3.8237,3.0807,5.6505,2.037,3.1393,6.2996,3.496,2.8277,1.9293,2.178,2.1859,2.5262,7.1971,4.6368,2.0443,2.2441,2.0197,6.8443,2.0024,1.5264,0.0006,1.0812,1.1182,2.7048,3.1229,0.9049,4.4929,1.86,1.8402,2.74,0.9296,4.7278,1.9671,4.9013,0.8825,1.342,0.0607,17.9613,0.0407,1.5497,1.9466,0.9136,4.2973,3.0752,5.7754,5.3324,0.5408,1.8749,0.7082,1.8361,3.1011,0.5734,3.7417,3.7681,1.5359,0.0823,0.063,4.5342,4.3318,2.8487,0.0287,1.3781,1.4553,1.3958,2.4215,1.3351,2.7889,3.1767,5.2278,2.0662,6.7208,1.1337,2.3903,1.5118,1.873,3.1271,1.9961,0.003,1.5637,4.5515,0.7735,5.6872,0.0931,1.4598,0.1679,3.1858,3.3564,0.7371,4.7353,3.1484,1.9144,1.7527,0.0886,2.4269,1.7352,5.7617,1.6495,4.8087,2.0178,0.3931,0.346,2.6254,2.2919,3.803,0.0089,0.7067,0.0366,0.0067,0.0016,2.3376,5.2712,1.7877,0.6937,1.8811,2.1151,0.3002,2.3216,1.042,0.0004,0.3416,0.6857,5.327,5.9323,4.4026,1.0442,0.9713,1.5388,0.7515,0.398,7.2152,2.614,1.8039,0.7057,0.7667,1.9808,3.4637,2.0669,1.1489,5.8628,1.4828,0.9024,3.404,3.1477,1.171,0.8422,2.5649,1.9391,4.3843,0.4067,6.2805,3.1794,2.2777,2.4325,2.7695,2.2816,4.9755,1.9581,2.4643,2.0244,3.8303,3.8256,4.6082,0.8856,4.5644,0.8692,4.1086,3.1094,0.4873,3.5057,1.1892,0.2476,5.169,6.6063,6.8781,4.3395,0.0879,1.3496,0.0658,3.8263,0.9368,1.3633,0.1109,0.892,3.1768,0.0004,3.0996,3.6573,2.0805,4.9015,8.862,0.4514,0.0114,0.0141,1.9941,2.9575,1.993,2.3037,1.7234,2.2878,2.6456,2.4467,8.2688,2.188,5.5194,1.3006,2.9399,1.5564,6.429,6.4449,2.5757,1.3906,2.4015,4.4353,4.3399,3.6058,5.4144,2.7446,1.915,2.1807,4.1794,0.7044,2.0028,0.2718,1.177,0.0636,2.5501,5.9453,0.0901,3.5272,0.0472,1.4278,2.3462,0.0232,5.4083,11.3105,5.0705,1.042,3.5322,1.271,0.8622,2.96,1.2818,2.09,4.8753,7.1339,1.9995,0.5807,1.3271,5.385,0.0107,0.7363,3.9395,0.7195,9.4501,0.5186,4.6706,5.4258,0.0006,2.282,0.5791,3.4395,0.0014,5.895,2.9152,0.7935,0.2629,1.646,2.3011,1.1372,3.1855,1.7108,3.5002,2.435,1.057,4.4602,0.0103,7.7698,2.4451,2.9997,0.098,3.8697,1.902,0.3283,0.7268,6.213,4.158,2.3706,0.4497,6.6993,3.2073,0.001,3.1975,1.6801,5.7207,0.0041,3.7273,3.9426,4.1533,1.0834,0.3468,1.1283,6.6551,2.4907,3.1219,0.4669,1.2147,1.1608,1.5236,0.0004,1.1418,3.1192,0.0402,1.3138,0.4504,0.2659,0.7757,0.5177,4.1918,3.605,0.9438,7.4938,3.7716,0.9493,2.0621,2.6097,2.4836,4.6113,0.818,0.6455,0.4614,2.4733,3.3334,1.8327,2.5881,1.5485,1.3145,5.1871,2.3173,1.2828,2.1888,0.8774,1.6088,0.3466,0.0003,3.1944,0.985,1.6144,1.8152,3.3303,1.0385,2.2418,1.0773,2.2236,1.6048,1.0324,3.769,1.1123,0.1697,1.522,2.5805,5.2358,0.0377,5.6619,5.2619,8.1566,0.1318,1.2989,0.7516,2.2835,0.0484,0.7682,4.1981,2.3143,0.0141,1.1231,1.3653,2.0857,2.4247,3.7633,0.7955,0.8094,4.8485,0.935,0.4465,2.4983,6.6242,2.2552,0.0001,1.1318,0.7855,5.3696,0.0287,2.7156,0.2101,6.7934,3.2275,0.7864,0.0014,2.3586,6.4811,3.8684,2.2269,2.3293,5.1526,2.3364,0.119,2.7134,2.3229,4.5729,0.2422,0.5115,1.0291,2.2755,5.1194,3.5643,2.9606,1.2033,0.1585,0.0614,1.2037,5.381,4.5476,0.1555,1.097,1.8775,0.063,0.0119,1.8761,2.0163,5.0194,1.2036,7.6078,1.793,3.5624,2.3648,3.156,5.9172,0.0007,0.0026,0.0043,3.3136,0.0022,2.7575,4.4266,0.062,1.6614,0.3966,0.7939,2.5011,5.2835,0.0201,7.0653,1.1542,2.0664,0.4402,5.0846,0.0237,2.1712,9.6259,2.1459,5.3975,2.8733,3.0392,2.2037,0.0006,0.7633,6.2227,0.1536,0.064,4.1869,0.3504,0.6858,2.944,3.1236,1.7222,0.0066,0.0768,0.6465,0.002,7.8059,3.7039,4.8756,8.9324,0.2304,1.8331,1.6436,1.7812,0.3641,2.1826,2.3117,6.1078,1.6279,3.5928,3.15,3.7123,4.477,3.3124,4.9033,2.0714,0.0195,4.6294,2.1122,4.2176,0.5532,1.3177,1.9037,0.5927,0.3821,5.4368,6.8733,4.4159,3.6412,2.9857,3.342,2.316,1.9243,0.8186,3.5866,2.4309,4.2076,2.9974,0.0467,1.9594,5.196,0.0003,0.0143,2.0204,4.296,6.07,4.8153,0.2205,4.0904,1.5557,5.0753,3.5472,2.1513,1.3428,3.6002,0.3929,3.0223,2.8556,1.561,0.8425,3.3175,0.5305,2.5305,1.3437,0.4712,0.886,3.3785,1.2457,0.5674,0.4444,0.675,2.1155,6.6338,3.7172,7.5657,2.1202,2.6303,1.1667,1.7992,2.5028,1.8872,2.0453,4.5861,7.3044,0.1983,6.9786,2.7548,0.9372,2.9763,3.2272,3.3255,7.5883,7.777,3.0998,2.897,1.4081]}
{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump will host Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives \u2019 top Democrat Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday night to discuss tax reform and other items on the legislative agenda ,","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump will host Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives \u2019 top Democrat Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday night to discuss tax reform and other items on the legislative agenda,\u201d the White House announced Tuesday. The first presidential meeting between Schumer and Trump will take place at the Capitol around 11:30 p.m.. Pelosi and Trump\u2019s meeting is scheduled for around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday (7:30 a.m. Thursday in the Senate chamber) at the Capitol, the White House said. \u201cCongress will hear from President Trump when he brings his agenda to the floor and we\u2019ll see how we can work together,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cWe need a much stronger American economy, and a stronger, fairer tax system is not simply a part of stronger prosperity, but a vital part of making our nation stronger.\u201d In a statement, Pelosi called Trump and Schumer the only two members of Congress with the \u201copportunity to achieve consensus on our most important domestic priorities.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Trump ally, said a White House summit between Schumer and the president was \u201ccompletely appropriate.\u201d \u201cThere are people in Congress who do not believe in bipartisanship, and there\u2019s no place for that in our system,\u201d Graham said. He added: \u201cWe need to put America first and do things to get things fixed; that\u2019s what this is about.\u201d Schumer said it was \u201cclear\u201d it was \u201cunusual\u201d for presidential meetings to take place behind closed doors, adding that Trump was invited to make his contribution. Democrats had called Trump to schedule the meeting after weeks of criticism of the GOP\u2019s fiscal conservatives. The Treasury Department said it would not discuss a Trump tax plan before Congress begins deliberating on a new tax reform proposal. \u201cThe president\u2019s team has no plans to discuss tax reform at this time or make any further proposal of his tax reform plan,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Republicans in Congress have been pushing for a sweeping new tax bill to address the U.S. government\u2019s $17 trillion budget deficit. Sen. John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, called last week for President Trump to work with Democrats to fix the budget. \u201cWe need a bipartisan plan to fix the budget before we make another deal with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service]. The president should work with Senate Majority Leader Schumer and House Speaker Pelosi, not delay a spending deal.\u201d Trump on Monday pushed back against suggestions he should give congressional leaders a tax plan to address a widening budget deficit with a warning that failing to address it could lead to financial chaos. \u201cToo much debt is bad debt and you can\u2019t borrow anymore than

The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\nIn this photo taken on July 17, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at a news conference at the White House.PHOTO: REUTERS\nWASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - In the wake of Hurricane Michael, Trump's supporters in the Gulf Coast are turning to social media to express their frustration and rage.\n\"Why didn't the President listen to the experts? Why the heck did he spend 10 days criticising me? And even then, I'm not convinced they were telling the truth,\" Trump's campaign manager Bill Stepien said.\nSome officials, especially in Florida, have tried to explain to President Trump the catastrophic risk posed by Hurricane Michael over the weekend.\n\"There is still damage done,\" said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has criticised Trump for failing to deliver disaster support to his state in the past.\nTrump was criticized for criticising the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) before the storm hit.\n\"They were right about the hurricane, were they not?\" Trump said in an interview on CNN. \"FEMA had the forecast the same way, but in this country everything is run by people that they do not even call the President,\" he said.\nDeSantis said he spoke with Trump on Sunday afternoon and told him the hurricane posed the most deadly threat to Florida's coastal communities on Monday.\nDeSantis said he urged FEMA and other federal agencies to prioritise relief efforts in its most severely affected communities.\nSome storm experts, who had called the hurricane a category 3 on Sunday (July 24), have since called it a category 4.\nTrump, meanwhile, is still waiting for the hurricane to weaken as the storm heads to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.\nThe hurricane brought record-breaking winds to Florida as it barrelled south-east across the United States, hitting Gulf Coast communities with up to 200 mph swells and ripping roofs off homes.\nHomes were demolished in Pensacola, while the Gulf Coast Power Company said it could not restore power to 1.2 million customers as a result of the storm.\nSome experts told CNN that the lack of warning and evacuation plans may have also contributed to deaths.\nThe evacuation numbers for the Gulf Coast were based on FEMA data, which do not distinguish between the types of people who moved.\n\"That's very important in light of the fact that there are people that were evacuating, and I wouldn't hesitate a second that were on their way to a safer place, are taking that journey when the hurricane hits, and they were killed by the hurricane,\" said Dr Kym Moore, a forecaster at the Atlantic

{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Rand Paul \u2019 s return to Washington may be delayed after he suffered five broken ribs during an assault at his Kentucky home , media reported on Sunday , citing a senior","text":"U.S. Senator Rand Paul \u2019 s return to Washington may be delayed after he suffered five broken ribs during an assault at his Kentucky home, media reported on Sunday, citing a senior police official.\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Paul was scheduled to board a flight to Washington early Monday on \u201c a stretcher after emergency surgery to place plates and screws \u201d at a local hospital.\nThe AP said hospital officials had earlier reported Paul has been kept in the intensive care unit for three weeks.\nA federal judge ordered Paul to appear in courtroom at least once a month to answer subpoenas and attend his child\u2019s school events.\nPaul, 50, was not a visible participant at law school commencement exercises at the University of Kentucky on Friday, and his absence at celebrations at the University of Louisville Friday evening gave further fuel to reports of his injuries.\nDuring a Friday speech at the University of Louisville, Paul told graduates to not forget the need for religious tolerance and national unity.\nPaul, a Republican, suffered injuries following a fight with a man who broke into his home around midnight, police said.\nThere was no indication of other attackers in the home, but police described the suspects as white men in their 20s and 30s and one as being a former prisoner who used a wheelchair as a weapon.\nPaul, a former member of the US Senate, has already faced criticism by conservative groups for not condemning President Barack Obama\u2019s move to open a \u201c public health care exchange \u201d that essentially turns US adults into customers of private insurers.\nIn a letter last year, Paul said, \u201cthe notion that one human body can get a good amount of pleasure and satisfaction out of causing so much pain to another seems to me to be quite a peculiar thing to take in the world of health care, if by it one is meant anything more than one set of words in a legal document.\u201d\nThe US is the world's largest exporter of uranium. In fact, over the past five years, the total value of uranium exports has grown from $50 million to $3.6 billion. More than 200 nations buy uranium from the United States annually, ranging from oil companies in Australia to the U. N. to Russia.\nOne of the reasons uranium prices are so low right now is due to what analysts call a weak spot in demand \u2014 the military.\nFor many years, the U.S. military has been spending more and more on materials like uranium, as it builds up a stockpile of weapons materials. However, the recent budget cuts, as well as the global economic crisis, have brought the military's arms budget to a halt.\n\"When it comes to nuclear weapons, the world's attention is directed to what Iran is doing, as well as some developments down south. But these threats, combined with the current economic situation, have kept funding flat or even slightly reducing,\" said Matthew B. Schmitt, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.\nUranium processing and the storage of uranium hexafluoride and uranium oxides is carried out by companies like Bechtel and CMP, while nuclear power plants are built by corporations like General Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, Westinghouse, and GE Capital.","token_len":665,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,3.6651,0.0009,11.3005,8.1161,8.7108,10.7858,0.6006,1.807,8.7024,1.0616,3.6257,5.5958,1.9782,7.495,7.9264,1.7662,0.4059,2.2824,2.1428,4.3979,2.1804,2.5272,5.6308,0.745,2.6584,6.3722,1.3643,2.7423,2.141,2.8987,1.5092,1.3252,4.4481,5.9835,0.9503,0.3409,0.7649,14.4736,4.8053,0.0005,0.9282,4.4378,0.2767,1.7896,1.8453,6.2053,0.0759,6.769,0.5803,1.0316,1.0203,2.4349,5.4038,2.009,5.3214,13.498,5.5804,4.2582,7.5631,0.0009,2.8859,6.4587,1.7246,2.3363,7.1596,6.5541,2.6141,3.8487,8.637,5.9586,4.2499,2.8587,2.8429,0.2784,0.6271,0.476,1.5337,2.7129,1.6971,6.6767,0.4138,2.3685,6.2446,2.6079,3.6012,6.2437,1.8555,7.428,0.945,1.7035,1.6972,0.0236,0.0077,2.1152,2.9187,1.9986,1.3228,0.3676,3.589,4.5336,1.1855,2.4807,1.6405,0.9282,2.7635,0.3741,8.8116,3.7669,3.7245,2.6253,1.4974,2.3056,1.8271,1.7671,7.8941,0.0252,2.6055,6.7971,3.8906,6.9104,9.1862,3.0903,0.5788,3.2061,7.6349,0.7444,0.4375,2.1894,2.0534,5.4923,0.0143,1.5741,4.933,3.5138,7.0802,4.7011,2.8548,8.884,1.6703,5.0728,7.4814,3.1829,1.3775,1.6481,0.007,0.5634,2.2748,2.8132,1.0449,2.661,1.617,4.7604,3.8476,11.0842,2.0879,0.9888,3.1866,0.0505,1.6283,6.2123,3.673,5.6248,5.7217,3.3732,0.0231,5.2681,1.3428,2.2421,3.401,0.3473,0.2167,5.1577,1.6235,4.5535,3.4451,0.8275,0.5785,1.5665,0.0874,0.6537,0.4944,0.6202,3.0443,5.7036,2.6539,4.5451,4.3953,2.1113,6.0674,0.779,6.3374,2.3665,1.4033,6.759,0.8208,0.7732,0.2666,3.8462,2.1867,1.6555,1.6163,0.8543,6.6988,4.4489,4.9351,0.7949,3.1448,0.5395,1.1336,3.241,1.3912,4.8951,0.8806,0.1261,0.5987,5.2738,3.743,3.3023,2.991,0.2355,0.1905,0.7295,5.889,1.3264,0.1827,3.4865,1.4163,6.1391,8.0459,2.5554,0.173,1.763,1.1072,1.7015,2.168,5.1894,1.398,4.0228,0.1267,2.352,1.45,1.5416,0.1367,0.9095,0.0478,1.2563,1.2488,0.001,3.6495,5.4686,5.5363,3.9582,3.1728,3.2723,6.4048,3.2965,5.7464,1.4565,2.8423,3.7519,0.4498,1.4713,0.2747,0.365,2.5916,2.2355,1.3161,1.9263,4.3579,0.0019,0.4653,6.7592,0.7316,0.9906,2.3125,5.9944,2.9128,2.4914,6.006,3.7812,1.6572,0.7798,3.7462,4.2597,4.7044,1.2379,0.002,5.0529,0.6724,0.2189,7.5749,0.1083,4.9107,2.5086,15.8692,1.2796,6.8937,3.7022,3.0232,2.3058,5.7199,2.0524,3.0713,7.9829,5.8516,7.574,6.5123,1.2224,5.7913,1.5076,1.3017,2.1783,0.4653,0.3061,3.4428,1.4336,2.9733,3.6491,2.152,0.4915,2.6054,1.5611,3.2632,6.4809,2.4374,4.6206,6.1719,0.2537,5.4512,5.9495,4.0415,1.5671,6.9522,3.6303,3.7903,4.8924,0.0459,6.4256,3.3223,3.5611,2.4336,0.0055,8.0887,5.4123,0.1696,0.4035,3.4667,3.4662,7.0575,1.8201,1.1496,1.903,0.2099,5.3151,3.0114,8.0489,3.8891,0.7958,5.1904,3.7962,2.2859,2.8993,2.2844,3.8666,0.122,2.1604,5.4965,6.434,4.718,2.6066,1.5003,2.535,8.3284,2.9202,0.0189,4.8687,6.8355,0.0226,6.7642,4.7138,1.1928,6.8418,2.0128,0.6609,4.7621,4.973,0.2629,2.2785,5.0169,3.3606,2.0892,0.9704,0.0821,1.2065,3.4156,0.0353,0.0134,9.2225,2.4069,3.3753,4.8835,0.0428,4.9017,1.0358,0.4523,2.6761,0.0876,0.4818,1.1102,4.3315,3.007,0.0262,1.1338,3.5472,1.461,2.5994,1.436,0.6276,5.0979,3.2664,0.6564,0.4319,4.743,0.4566,2.0337,0.4507,1.0082,5.7805,0.1679,4.658,3.1919,6.945,2.4567,0.7122,1.299,1.5632,0.0111,4.062,1.0106,6.495,0.1063,7.652,4.0076,2.3162,6.7616,0.359,2.0729,3.8971,0.0013,11.3664,0.1167,3.0741,2.6432,0.6905,0.408,5.5866,0.732,0.2284,3.684,3.8651,2.991,1.5906,1.1368,2.4638,7.0738,0.0042,0.188,2.7484,0.0959,6.2546,5.3327,0.9791,1.2754,5.0062,7.3556,0.1945,3.2633,5.6116,1.8769,8.3625,4.9965,1.2385,4.714,3.3856,0.8062,0.1742,0.9114,2.0701,0.0008,0.249,0.0373,1.5473,0.742,0.6088,5.2848,2.1567,1.8377,0.0157,1.0039,7.3514,3.8396,1.307,1.7912,3.747,1.7976,4.3989,2.0871,2.4161,0.4126,0.318,3.3829,6.2118,1.4634,3.7628,0.0047,1.7264,4.7679,5.1843,0.8465,3.2915,4.2926,0.1338,0.0087,1.1617,7.565,2.3113,1.9366,0.4729,0.5587,4.3535,1.5646,1.0857,1.9195,6.2107,1.8755,2.0317,1.1186,3.1745,0.455,0.4246,3.8412,4.4039,2.9463,0.1692,0.0384,3.5016,0.8809,0.2637,1.296,4.8899,1.8561,4.9882,0.7475,4.5346,1.4067,3.9861,5.6951,0.625,0.4,2.1304,4.5796,0.8406,0.0377,4.9136,7.5703,8.3258,4.2394,2.704,2.4829,4.9177,6.1651,3.5084,4.2085,0.0111,0.9414,4.1168,2.5576,2.0829,0.3768,1.5227,4.8117,6.8696,6.5375,5.0549,2.2262,5.4355,7.1468,1.3976,0.9025,5.0709,4.5172,1.8281,4.4725,3.0536,0.133,2.4233,1.6257,1.0813,0.5676,3.6564,1.4555,0.0,0.8794,0.2682,4.8061,0.5546,0.0043,9.7862,3.248,4.3162,4.8479,0.2218,2.5703,9.6629,0.0527,0.0045,0.0142,0.0809,4.0662,3.6775,6.1701,0.021,1.7805,5.9201,0.025,1.297,4.1588,1.4279,7.2952,0.2169,0.0122,1.4676,4.7511,4.8389,1.3512,4.6816,3.4068,2.0844,0.4721,1.2837,3.0097,2.3622,6.2687,1.4283,3.3738,0.2547,1.5084,5.9383,0.0206,0.0,2.1321,0.6999,6.1805,0.0098,0.0,1.1418,0.6503,6.0523,6.272,0.3961]}
{"prompt":"Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Monday left the door open to a presidential run to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and said he is focused now on boosting Democrats","text":"Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Monday left the door open to a presidential run to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and said he is focused now on boosting Democrats in the Senate \u2014 something he would hope to accomplish by having better candidates compete for the party\u2019s nomination.\nBiden, the son of Delaware Attorney General Robert F. and the former vice president under President Bill Clinton, said the first focus of his office will be on helping Democratic candidates in the 2020 election cycle and a second would be to push for better representation in the U.S. Senate. One such candidate he would like to win \u2014 and to help win \u2014 would be former Massachusetts Gov. Chris Christie.\nAsked if he would seek out the Republican-friendly Christie on election day but lose, Biden said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see; it will depend. But with a president there, it is kind of a two-edged sword. There are opportunities, but also there are great dangers facing the country and facing the Democratic Party. And they have to start somewhere.\u201d\nHe said the Senate should focus on issues that don\u2019t involve a major tax. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the tax. But the Senate needs to get out of the game of playing politics and has to get into the game of playing politics where I actually hear what\u2019s going on in the country and where the American people are thinking about and where leaders ought to be listening to them.\u201d\nThe Vermont state senator\u2019s comments came as he and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney were talking about Republican candidates heading to the 2020 election. Romney, who served as Romney\u2019s presidential bid manager, is expected to announce his candidacy this week.\nBiden, in an interview with CNN with Anderson Cooper on Sunday, said if Republicans have an effective candidate, they would \u201chave to be willing to lose.\u201d\n\u201cDo what you need to do to be ahead at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have good ideas, they may have good ideas and better ideas than some of the people we are running. And if you have to lose, you lose. And I\u2019m not really happy about seeing a situation where I know you know I think your guy should win and you\u2019re not ready.\u201d\nThe former vice president said he hopes to get Democratic candidates ready for the election, saying he is already having those \u201cgo get them\u201d conversations to find good candidates who are ready to seek the nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the general election, because I think the 2020 general and president are going to have a huge impact.\u201d\nBiden also said he plans to work with the Democratic National Committee and other Democrats to organize candidates on \u201cissues, not politics,\u201d saying the Democrats must first figure out who will win and then figure out how it will look if their candidate loses.\nWhile Biden\u2019s

{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Tom Cotton , a hawkish Iraq war veteran who has said he did not consider waterboarding to be torture , is likely to be chosen by President Donald Trump as the next","text":"U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, a hawkish Iraq war veteran who has said he did not consider waterboarding to be torture, is likely to be chosen by President Donald Trump as the next head of the National Security Council. Trump\u2019s pick to replace John Bolton, a hawk whose controversial tenure as President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser sparked fury among Democrats and some Republicans, won\u2019t be announced until after Thanksgiving. But two senior administration officials said Cotton, a former Army Corps of Engineers official and former ambassador to Germany, appears likely to be confirmed quickly. An announcement is expected on Friday, the first official day of the new administration. Cotton, who was nominated by President George H. W. Bush, said last week he had no regrets about being tapped by the current administration. \u201cThe only thing I really regret is I couldn\u2019t be here more often,\u201d Cotton told a Senate committee hearing on the Iraq war. \u201cThis country owes me, and I owe this country. As a former senior U.S. ambassador, I have the opportunity to represent our country.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to pardon former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Friday. The White House declined to confirm the news. Trump has said he will release his official pardon list for the day after Thanksgiving as part of a tradition carried out by all presidents since Ulysses S. Grant. The New York Times first reported the pardon for Giuliani. The decision is expected to be announced later Friday morning. Trump will also announce, according to White House officials the same day, a pardon for Michael Flynn, former Trump National Security adviser who resigned after failing to convince Senate intelligence committee members about the Russian election interference issue. Trump\u2019s official pardon list follows a pardon for the actor Mel Gibson, who pleaded guilty last month to criminal charges stemming from a 1986 drunken driving accident. In a sign of impatience, a few hours after Trump was sworn in as president Thursday, he tweeted, \u201cGood morning to you all. I am extremely hungry, & I hope that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Several hours later, he tweeted, \u201cThank you for your patience in this transition process.\u201d\nA former aide to President Richard Nixon said Trump will pardon him after the new president takes office on January 20th. A spokesman for Nixon\u2019s daughter and current President, Laura Bush, said the former Trump campaign counsel asked to speak to Nixon\u2019s biographer, Michael Wolff, but was prevented from doing so. It is unclear whether this request was for personal reasons or simply to confirm the pardon, which if granted, would be the fifth presidential pardons issued on Friday by Trump. \u201cIf you think that you can ask him to pardon you a few days or weeks later after he\u2019s been inaugurated, you are very na\u00efve,\u201d Wolff tweeted. \u201cThis is one of the only places in the political world where a pardon is the last thing you want to ask for as an aide or a political ally.\u201d In September, former deputy campaign manager and executive director for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, John Podesta, told the New York Times that Trump was considering a pardon of former acting FBI Director Andrew

He has seen his two primary rivals, a Democrat and a Republican, emerge victorious in the primaries for the Democratic nomination for president while he has been unable to win a single primary debate in the race for the Republican nomination.\nThere were no immediate plans for a transition with Mr Trump, a self-effacing, outspoken celebrity and media figure who has not held a job since arriving in the White House, expected to announce his candidacy again soon.\nInstead, Mr Trump's longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has reportedly been in conflict with the president, will take over as White House counsel.\nMs Kelly said the job of the White House chief of staff is more complex \"under these circumstances than it was in the past\".\nMr Priebus told journalists in the Oval Office after President Obama had resigned that Mr Trump knew he would be replaced when he requested a change, but he said it was unlikely he would leave any important jobs open.\nMr Trump was quick to use his Twitter account to welcome Mr Kelly's confirmation from the Senate, tweeting, \"Great selection by our new HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - John Kelly for PI:USER.\"\nMs Kelly, a former Army Corps officer, was selected Friday after a week of public scrutiny over her tenure as Trump's press secretary and as White House counsel to the president. She was confirmed on a party-line vote 56-45. Five Republicans voted to confirm her, two Democrats abstained, and two Republicans did not vote.\nWith the confirmation of Ms Kelly, the Senate has now confirmed 10 of the 11 new appointees announced by President Obama on Dec 15, after he left office. He has confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the acting Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and General James Mattis, the nominee for defence secretary.\nThe 11th nomination is for Secretary of Health and Human Services Leavitt, a former congressman.\nPresident Barack Obama has now confirmed 10 out of the 11 new appointees he announced after he left office, after a chaotic week of confirmation hearings.\nFive Republicans voted to confirm the first lady's appointee, a Democrat, but two others did not. Two of Mr Obama's Republicans also voted \"not in\".\nMr Obama announced on Monday his cabinet picks, which includes several key decisions, including naming three secretaries and a number of key advisers.\nThe president appointed an eight-year incumbent as secretary of Labour. His choice, former Michigan senator Tom DeLay, had been criticized by both labour unions and the Republican Party. While there are Republican concerns about his record, Mr Obama said he respected the former congressman.\nAlso on the domestic front, Mr Obama has appointed former Democratic congressman Sam Nunn as ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a choice that will face tough opposition from Republicans, who would like to see Republican Rep.

At least 10,000 residents were living within the condo block the building is located.\nDuterte, who last year was accused of ordering the removal of fire hydrants in Manila to make way for a highway,

{"prompt":"An increasing number of fishing boats from North Korea has been appearing off Japan - some in distress , some abandoned and some with dead bodies on board - raising fears about infiltration by spies","text":"An increasing number of fishing boats from North Korea has been appearing off Japan - some in distress, some abandoned and some with dead bodies on board - raising fears about infiltration by spies.\nThe coastguard said on Monday some of the fishing boats were carrying food for North Koreans who were stranded after an industrial dispute in July with Korean fishermen.\nBut it said the boats were no longer going to North Korea, but rather heading into southern Japan, an area controlled by the Japanese government.\nIt appears that the boats have not stopped when confronted by Japanese ships, the coastguard said.\nJapanese police have said they have detained a Korean man who was in a boat carrying four bodies from the southern Japanese island of Kyushu; police have also confiscated some fishing gear.\nThe coastguard said North Korean boats could be carrying spies who are attempting to infiltrate local industries and other government agencies.\nIt said some officials who have been caught in smuggling efforts or who have been caught working for North Korea were punished in a summary fashion, by being shot in the back of the head with a rifle.\nThe fishermen's strikes were in revenge for Japanese fishermen being chased by the North Korean coastguard, who fired on the Japanese boats.\nIn July some 1,300 Japanese fishermen and their families were forced to retreat to the open sea due to the dispute, with Japan denying any involvement with the dispute.\nThe Japan Coast Guard (JCG) said the boats were carrying food, such as fish, for North Koreans who had been stranded after the incident and were trying to enter Japan illegally.\nAs well as the bodies of four fishermen dead, the coastguard said the bodies of two sailors who were thrown overboard by the North Korean coastguard were also found.\nOne sailor died, while the second is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital.\nThe coastguard said it found the bodies with the help from the Japan Coast Guard's warship Takaikai and also from ships belonging to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency.\nMeanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he would discuss with his US counterpart Barack Obama a possible military response to North Korea's nuclear tests.\nA Japanese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the prime minister is due to meet American Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta later on Tuesday.\nThe prime minister is visiting the US for a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\nThe United States has repeatedly warned that \"additional steps\" will be required against North Korea, although Washington has not yet formally called for sanctions to be imposed on North Korea in response to the nuclear tests.\nIt said the country has already shown it is capable of deploying enough ordnance and missiles to threaten the United States.\nUS President Barack Obama said on Saturday that the North had been \"very clear\" it wanted to develop an atomic-bomb capability, and that was a reason the United States should impose new sanctions against North Korea.\nHe criticised North Korea's behaviour and said he believed it had \"committed an act of war\".\n\"How can we allow ourselves to go to war with an adversary who clearly wants to destroy us? If we're prepared to go to war then we must do so with a purpose,\" Mr Obama told a conference in Helsinki.","token_len":670,"entropy":[9.2187,0.2919,0.017,11.0885,1.6768,4.4792,5.0334,1.2858,6.0053,1.2204,8.2071,3.4193,3.2353,6.8224,3.4329,3.441,5.7681,1.8228,1.6907,5.6751,2.662,1.6466,3.7188,6.1443,1.2574,2.4813,1.0182,1.1709,5.4938,1.7434,3.1409,10.0279,1.499,6.7551,1.0741,0.2871,13.5051,5.8395,1.0999,1.5515,2.0889,1.8857,5.8538,2.9758,0.4162,3.5926,0.1511,1.4264,2.7677,5.1717,3.4997,3.7846,1.0036,2.2533,1.9425,3.1385,4.5835,3.5853,6.1275,3.9045,2.0411,5.0266,4.4939,6.1541,2.1716,0.3155,0.1903,3.066,2.5804,1.0583,1.6603,2.3991,0.9862,4.8862,0.2498,4.6894,1.3364,4.258,0.1593,1.8405,3.0456,2.9486,3.6251,4.429,6.2127,0.9156,1.5701,5.4852,0.4461,5.136,0.0225,1.0543,2.0665,0.8238,0.2385,0.1528,2.9219,8.0751,1.3712,1.4024,2.5706,2.2434,3.6797,3.6777,5.6464,5.9798,0.4492,1.6278,5.206,1.6317,2.8493,1.4412,0.0168,0.1346,0.2928,0.1937,3.7351,3.4041,2.043,2.4313,0.8558,1.3939,3.1724,2.8505,4.9919,0.9796,1.4943,1.6372,3.5939,1.9908,1.4282,2.5852,5.0006,3.5272,2.4287,1.4098,6.2177,1.6624,1.3253,0.0849,2.9365,0.0684,0.0005,7.8502,4.4108,1.6857,1.3239,4.927,4.4906,2.9435,2.0346,2.1538,0.1757,1.6374,2.6347,0.0309,0.4355,5.5635,0.6142,3.0482,4.1107,1.0661,3.5928,9.5655,3.0165,2.1534,4.6342,0.0167,1.0285,6.168,6.9045,2.1562,4.2398,3.4734,2.4535,0.5015,0.2346,2.4609,0.6746,4.0419,6.6043,4.1331,2.6718,0.8167,3.1768,1.9519,7.9165,4.6729,5.9838,1.5792,1.2298,1.0045,2.7101,4.7717,1.5625,2.0927,0.6745,2.1608,8.0558,3.74,2.6974,8.2867,8.572,2.3289,6.2668,1.414,5.7036,2.5879,0.1264,2.4573,2.4245,0.0685,0.0496,2.4721,1.0635,3.7419,0.8321,0.2123,1.5713,4.1231,3.3959,8.0662,2.3861,4.0527,6.5599,0.193,3.2316,2.4622,1.9261,6.3712,1.5071,2.4609,1.1071,0.5579,3.1709,0.3139,2.7355,1.9517,4.0673,2.422,2.021,3.6924,3.1769,1.9333,0.2833,3.6143,2.3872,6.0735,4.5893,0.0449,2.5936,1.3303,0.5785,3.5463,2.1733,1.3717,0.4606,2.715,0.3427,5.9071,1.0628,1.7715,7.5543,0.5924,4.2946,0.0032,1.4474,5.8466,2.2444,2.3069,3.7384,6.1671,1.649,1.1018,4.8635,0.8045,5.9222,0.2208,0.3473,1.5942,4.0969,3.621,0.4592,4.8577,3.6732,0.253,0.0843,0.6824,2.8075,3.7233,1.068,1.2281,1.7578,2.2633,6.2959,0.0016,3.1189,0.9403,1.6273,0.9434,0.4469,0.744,1.5873,0.6749,0.2765,3.0441,2.0495,4.4346,3.2181,1.4474,3.0437,0.0113,4.1287,0.6755,3.6639,0.2644,0.2571,6.2863,2.3411,0.0919,1.911,5.2774,1.2713,4.0031,1.5707,6.2624,1.4282,2.0834,2.6537,0.0156,0.2508,2.2753,2.0059,0.3203,1.6575,5.8394,2.0259,0.6579,6.9023,0.4872,2.2632,1.5388,0.9972,0.1739,1.5353,0.0281,1.4605,0.7411,1.7244,1.7284,0.2894,4.7084,2.7018,2.5617,2.559,0.9606,0.6193,3.4142,4.4119,4.4441,3.2342,1.2091,1.2668,0.4963,0.4229,0.8862,0.4535,1.1545,2.5438,0.0097,0.2899,2.0037,4.8818,2.0811,0.7293,5.8383,2.0667,2.0105,7.4024,2.2624,3.2744,0.7937,0.0791,1.4623,10.3144,0.0017,4.4767,7.3143,5.1543,2.3659,2.9351,5.0873,2.2455,6.2596,2.5464,0.0021,0.774,7.2093,5.4611,0.0622,0.3052,0.0045,0.957,0.0339,1.9051,2.5831,2.0613,2.5676,7.7836,0.2443,0.2992,0.6282,0.2635,6.1495,0.1608,3.1167,1.7003,0.008,7.1312,0.1285,0.0118,4.2101,2.2802,2.0551,5.3996,2.6533,2.5088,5.2202,0.0565,3.2078,0.0064,2.2636,2.9675,2.8295,2.6194,0.2173,2.1239,0.0997,0.7558,1.1071,2.5053,0.7974,0.2741,4.0537,2.4043,3.68,0.1059,2.1473,0.6112,1.591,3.3512,0.0029,3.767,4.5192,0.0868,0.4778,3.9698,8.5457,3.793,1.4016,0.0248,0.0013,0.0001,2.7483,4.0893,0.4374,1.4642,0.012,0.0003,3.7,1.4626,1.3032,0.4751,0.3326,1.6968,4.9138,0.0108,2.5115,4.4762,1.9543,1.1884,1.9899,1.5168,2.0967,1.1679,1.0569,3.8652,0.3505,0.0034,0.3005,0.0101,2.9871,1.6141,0.627,1.7898,4.0496,0.0943,1.2283,3.8969,1.9417,1.4787,5.6782,7.2555,0.1612,3.1861,0.3805,3.1109,0.1636,2.7529,5.7698,0.4953,0.0577,2.003,4.4115,3.1353,0.7292,2.1048,1.8429,3.6172,3.4405,0.7995,5.1205,2.296,0.0501,1.3581,1.4454,1.8452,0.0408,4.1458,0.8745,0.3175,1.2388,2.2195,1.1465,0.225,0.4419,4.0971,2.568,1.8708,4.3679,2.5818,3.3956,4.902,2.7545,1.0447,3.6998,0.0173,5.2357,6.2496,7.478,0.0004,2.2699,2.3827,0.3773,2.9371,0.7507,1.3279,0.0042,1.1551,0.5276,5.1147,1.4161,0.3898,0.0022,1.6979,1.2639,2.4852,0.4525,1.6396,3.0975,3.0941,3.2775,1.2049,2.5044,2.4008,0.5088,2.4271,2.9704,0.4524,2.2022,3.0104,1.1756,4.9393,3.4643,2.1117,1.4585,1.9225,1.4393,5.5417,2.2952,5.5627,2.5922,1.1606,0.0072,2.7216,4.381,2.6559,0.4916,1.9572,1.317,0.0151,0.3354,0.3687,2.9749,6.6545,1.7741,0.1757,0.9619,3.7211,1.7965,1.1884,2.7383,2.4214,1.7353,1.8544,2.373,6.2719,0.1683,2.35,0.5992,0.0904,0.9365,1.4112,0.3994,2.7672,6.1986,1.3045,1.1321,3.5019,3.7291,0.0471,4.1065,1.934,0.1116,0.709,2.6596,2.555,1.2972,4.8412,3.2914,0.1383,2.6574,1.1835,2.0389,4.3975,1.3592,2.4719,4.4436,0.3251,2.0691,0.2985,0.0085,4.991,0.8477,2.8015,2.6094,0.8029,2.2254,2.4683,5.9973,0.8368,2.5343,0.0142,1.6941,1.6654,3.8286,0.9092,7.6911,0.3074]}
{"prompt":"Iraq demanded on Thursday that the U.S. government backtrack on a decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital to avoid fuelling terrorism , and a prominent Iraqi militia said the decision was a reason","text":"Iraq demanded on Thursday that the U.S. government backtrack on a decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital to avoid fuelling terrorism, and a prominent Iraqi militia said the decision was a reason to attack American bases.\nThe U.S. decision, announced March 9 by President Donald Trump, was met with outrage in Iraq among religious and secular Sunni groups, fearing it would provoke a regional response. Iraqis believe that Jerusalem belonged to the Jews since ancient times and it was an integral part of the Islamic holy sites.\nIn Iraq, however, most Muslims and Sunnis reject the view that the holy city is the place of birth of the Prophet Mohammed on the other hand, the majority of Shia who are close to the Iranian government tend to support the proposal.\nThe Pentagon on Thursday said the U.S. would accept the Israeli decision. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Baghdad that recognition of Jerusalem would lead a regional Islamist uprising.\nIraq was quick to announce that it was withdrawing recognition from Israel for the sake of peace.\n\u201cThe government of the Islamic Republic of Iraq rejected the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This is a violation of the principles of justice, equity, international law and international conventions, according to sources inside the Iraqi government. This constitutes the most dangerous and destructive challenge in the current regional and international situation and threatens regional security,\u201d the sources added.\nTrump, who made the surprising announcement as he visited Israel and had previously pledged not to do so, made his decision at a time when his administration struggles with a wave of criticism for its actions in Syria.\nTrump has also sought to distance himself from some decisions that he has made, such as his recognition of Jerusalem, and he has insisted that he is only trying to secure peace.\nThe United States should not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful military command said Sunday, as he warned that the decision would spark clashes between Muslims and Israelis.\nThe comments came as the administration of President Donald Trump made the controversial proposal, which was first announced on March 9.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea, but it would provoke a huge fight and nobody likes that,\u201d Amir al-Hashimi said in a tweet.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital has sparked outrage within his own administration, as well as in Iran and Syria, a U.S. defense official said Thursday.\nThe Defense Department says it\u2019s ready to accept a recommendation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s foreign minister that Washington recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Netanyahu has urged the United States to break its longstanding policy of not recognizing the city as Israel\u2019s capital in any form, and to follow the Jewish settlement bloc\u2019s lead in relocating embassies to the city.\nThe United States doesn\u2019t recognize Jerusalem as an Israeli capital and President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the city, signaling a potential end to a decades-old diplomatic tradition. Trump made the change in a tweet, and on Wednesday night pledged that he was simply moving the embassy \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d","token_len":670,"entropy":[10.274,5.0378,2.7877,0.9941,1.595,3.125,0.002,0.2661,0.0539,2.3981,5.8959,2.7263,0.3964,2.6605,2.2306,0.6929,5.41,1.4017,0.17,0.6633,12.9915,1.852,6.4592,1.7247,7.5846,0.0006,4.6543,2.3838,2.682,4.0966,7.5868,6.4459,7.829,2.5268,2.1823,3.4316,0.9803,2.0787,8.5562,1.1046,4.8603,6.1862,4.3174,1.3718,0.2573,13.907,2.0205,0.0008,0.0199,0.1385,3.8182,2.4672,2.8728,6.6968,3.4709,1.9529,1.868,1.9274,0.0191,0.2653,1.8074,3.7677,0.0957,3.7856,2.4044,1.4893,7.3557,4.6806,1.8252,3.2697,1.6048,2.5751,1.4194,7.0506,1.7436,0.636,4.6473,1.9517,4.883,5.2518,1.2849,7.7074,3.7199,1.7441,2.7195,8.1659,0.0524,1.3448,3.769,5.7223,2.7265,0.0493,1.3727,4.165,2.0015,4.0887,2.3169,0.106,0.0053,0.8302,2.851,1.8231,3.0909,1.1665,0.2729,3.3477,4.515,0.2681,4.1474,0.0007,5.1762,3.6998,2.9461,3.3808,0.001,3.4894,0.4143,5.4895,0.3558,1.2974,3.3256,1.4644,1.5278,2.3384,4.2816,0.4428,6.8825,0.8328,2.2473,0.8335,1.2906,6.6511,1.2164,6.4119,0.5208,0.3316,4.1451,5.5218,0.7984,6.6198,4.1807,3.5848,5.9924,0.0428,0.7873,5.8593,2.5404,8.9857,0.1641,1.8018,0.6626,6.0667,0.4228,0.3355,1.7475,6.0615,3.8436,0.5327,1.0309,1.7049,1.288,0.0005,0.0024,0.0424,2.0088,5.303,1.2665,7.0949,1.1692,2.5983,3.957,5.9659,0.0037,2.5032,0.0003,4.3159,4.6895,1.564,8.453,0.375,0.1843,1.7845,2.7861,7.3782,3.1897,6.845,3.1064,1.4597,0.2421,4.4799,4.5981,5.4702,0.0154,5.2982,1.5779,0.6026,1.9835,1.7123,8.5561,2.6837,3.1095,3.5051,1.2127,4.3218,0.0018,2.6786,1.6154,0.7629,10.5127,8.5137,5.2,4.5443,0.9829,3.5923,1.9175,1.5042,0.0923,0.4373,5.6302,0.6711,6.028,1.9345,0.0962,0.7405,1.486,0.3499,0.1416,0.8086,2.1947,5.094,2.1048,1.7494,3.1452,0.0292,0.9104,4.4976,0.2022,5.9783,1.1155,6.2989,1.2245,5.4133,0.1536,0.3553,1.6898,5.0031,1.5978,2.6724,0.0061,5.9256,3.8482,0.6359,1.6197,0.1625,0.3836,5.3322,5.6916,2.9866,3.0451,5.8254,4.0365,4.6726,6.7664,3.563,0.7596,3.977,4.5221,3.9652,0.9219,2.8752,3.2709,3.906,4.0822,1.0141,1.4017,11.7653,6.6743,1.9843,2.2063,2.4098,0.0405,0.3415,6.1344,2.7514,0.9136,4.3572,0.9059,9.0723,0.9346,4.4405,1.0167,2.5773,2.5902,3.0771,6.5142,3.4409,4.3055,3.0426,0.0024,4.3609,0.4023,0.27,4.0682,2.1311,1.2111,2.9726,0.8604,4.9209,0.3815,3.4127,1.243,7.5741,1.7456,1.8575,5.2832,0.0034,4.0793,2.9421,1.5188,4.2414,0.7372,1.1683,1.1492,0.5572,3.2107,2.5054,3.1397,4.0219,0.1396,2.7084,0.0686,0.0227,4.691,8.4756,2.297,1.4962,1.1024,0.7501,2.5894,1.9166,0.0009,1.9815,6.1599,0.0404,0.134,2.6453,2.2718,3.1242,0.8256,5.3973,0.6316,1.4648,2.2516,4.4993,3.1271,0.022,4.0655,2.0422,2.0707,0.4962,2.1041,2.6524,0.2142,5.64,1.7817,5.4989,0.214,0.356,1.711,0.1284,0.0463,0.2027,0.7869,2.288,4.6512,0.0026,6.2766,0.0607,9.7903,7.5075,5.7964,5.8659,3.116,5.3941,0.8382,4.8231,1.4509,2.8891,1.9059,3.9307,1.4319,1.6145,2.9498,1.5057,3.6115,5.4911,1.3972,4.6234,0.2592,3.9527,0.5511,0.2695,1.9732,6.0047,1.2526,1.369,1.8706,5.1926,2.4988,1.0935,0.3293,0.0309,4.1697,2.5402,3.2948,6.5934,3.5484,1.2126,2.2068,2.6638,2.3757,2.0511,0.6933,0.8908,2.2616,0.8382,2.3996,0.4828,6.8544,11.702,5.9241,3.0258,1.7745,3.4615,2.1378,3.9353,1.0127,0.6727,1.8139,1.6028,0.6806,1.1085,0.6888,1.2569,3.3683,5.879,1.0277,5.4898,3.8177,2.9401,7.7346,3.9163,2.2307,1.4667,1.6094,2.7614,7.6337,1.7991,0.1309,5.8345,0.1044,4.172,1.7163,1.0177,2.4919,0.6381,0.6192,5.0542,1.2211,0.0668,4.7708,0.6323,0.0787,0.8079,0.7091,0.2483,0.0845,0.1981,0.6076,3.7942,0.0187,0.0236,0.0241,3.3535,2.822,4.6845,3.794,3.2136,0.2516,2.2919,1.2454,3.2015,1.251,0.046,2.3567,4.6519,1.5029,3.1897,0.9385,4.4174,4.1189,0.0005,0.0381,0.2246,4.0821,0.0625,0.3595,4.2931,0.1912,0.323,1.7193,4.9715,0.5289,4.5415,1.7652,9.7333,0.3856,0.0765,4.2151,0.141,3.3139,2.5403,5.3481,0.5938,5.4342,0.8476,0.0031,0.0314,0.001,2.0314,0.117,0.1966,3.926,0.9946,1.3173,3.8663,1.4638,0.2228,0.092,0.491,2.6065,0.0047,0.0076,0.0098,0.7274,5.2916,2.0263,4.6142,1.4452,1.6171,0.0313,0.1485,7.1177,2.9117,3.3991,1.6869,0.1574,1.7719,0.6858,2.1384,1.3138,1.3058,0.4063,2.2891,0.005,0.0068,0.0658,3.7571,3.5033,4.8123,1.4322,1.889,2.8796,5.4026,1.4147,6.3843,6.9613,2.8,5.9446,0.1573,0.0634,3.3877,1.3212,8.0602,0.046,6.2447,2.3521,2.1446,1.5429,0.4408,0.2106,1.5578,2.4527,0.1297,6.6739,0.4326,0.2857,0.0049,0.6832,0.5604,0.1428,4.4965,0.7786,1.0411,2.3717,5.5265,0.8532,0.0171,5.1337,1.7602,3.1385,2.2982,2.862,0.5299,3.5588,1.072,1.3444,0.0006,0.0087,0.0707,1.1248,1.2402,0.0584,0.001,0.1124,4.0642,1.581,1.6955,5.7328,1.5075,4.4782,6.5502,0.0375,2.72,1.9614,0.0393,1.1267,1.9431,3.1689,1.0354,4.185,4.1645,0.4413,5.6604,1.6671,1.1608,1.5517,2.2291,3.2616,4.2086,2.3234,4.2331,7.0333,2.2689,1.1139,3.8419,6.8552,2.7187,0.6351,0.3339,6.6015,4.7271,3.8453,1.9925,0.0113,0.4432,0.9656,5.7331,4.2681]}
{"prompt":"Congressional Republicans moved to hasten an overhaul of the U.S. tax code on Thursday , while Federal Reserve officials warned in rare public remarks that President Donald Trump \u2019 s tax plan could lead to","text":"Congressional Republicans moved to hasten an overhaul of the U.S. tax code on Thursday, while Federal Reserve officials warned in rare public remarks that President Donald Trump \u2019 s tax plan could lead to a potential recession as it weakens economic growth. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that some tax cuts could lead to a looming trade war, which would add to the uncertainty that has hit much of the world economy. \u201cThe economy is already suffering from the uncertainty in the trade wars. \u2026 if you cut this tax thing, it will only make things worse,\u201d Mnuchin said at a conference on the tax code. U.S. Representative Richard Neal said the tax plan will likely be overwhelming bipartisan support as it will increase consumer spending and investment. Neal, a Tennessee Republican, said he expects most Democrats with an eye on their November election to support it while Democrats in power in Washington, as well as some Republicans, could back a different package. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the tax bill as is doesn\u2019t get enacted. It\u2019s going to. It\u2019s going to be a huge blow to the current tax cut, but it will support people\u2019s families,\u201d Neal said on MSNBC. The latest proposal by the Trump administration would replace all of the 10-year, 15-year, 20-year and other tax breaks with a one-year surtax on foreign income that could total as much as $11 trillion, based on conservative estimates. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that some tax cuts that President Donald Trump proposed over the weekend could lead to a potential trade war, which would add to the uncertainty that has hit much of the world economy. The Treasury Department, which hasn\u2019t formally advised the president of potential tax threats or consequences of the proposal, issued a letter suggesting that the president\u2019s plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans could hurt global economic growth, a sign that the White House is seeking to shift blame for the nation\u2019s economic woes from Trump to international leaders. The letter, sent to Trump adviser Steve Bannon and given to NBC News by a person familiar with the matter, was signed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as well as Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Thomas Donohue. A Treasury Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday as far as the president\u2019s own financial holdings are concerned. A spokesperson for the president said he and his wife do not have U.S. tax or investment holdings. \u201cThe president is committed to bringing an end to loopholes for the rich and creating incentives for people to work hard, start a business and become a success,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe president\u2019s tax plan takes a comprehensive and balanced approach that supports hard work \u2013 especially for our families and businesses \u2013 and he\u2019s determined to deliver to voters for a better American future.\u201d Neal said he expects many Democrats with an eye on their November election to support it, while Democrats in power in Washington, as well as some Republicans, could back a different package.

{"prompt":"The Massachusetts state senate on Friday prepared to open an independent probe into accusations that Majority Leader Stanley Rosenberg \u2019 s husband used his political connections to sexually harass men , following a Boston Globe","text":"The Massachusetts state senate on Friday prepared to open an independent probe into accusations that Majority Leader Stanley Rosenberg \u2019 s husband used his political connections to sexually harass men, following a Boston Globe story on Wednesday. The Senate passed an amended resolution directing the attorney general to conduct the probe, the Globe reported. The bill also would require the investigation to involve all members of the state Senate and would set a deadline of up to 90 days for the probe to conclude. Rosenberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nPresident Obama plans to meet privately Wednesday night with leaders of six major U.S. computer giants at the White House, in a sign that the government is stepping up its use of technology in national security. President Barack Obama has long emphasized the need for American technological leadership, and his administration has been working to bolster the U.S. computer industry in an effort to strengthen America\u2019s national security. But as his administration grapples with the cyber attacks that disrupted several Internet companies on Tuesday, the goal of ensuring the safety of computer networks is expected to come to the forefront of the negotiations with the corporations.\nIt\u2019s not easy to live in South Korea. Most women want to make sure that no one sees them in their underwear. Women with big bellies tend to worry more that they will not match their clothes. So do women with stretchy arms. Most of us also have the odd problem to solve.\nSome women have to live with some problems that are difficult to avoid. Those who are lucky are able to hide their problems from their husbands. But many would wish they could hide them from the world at large \u2013 even those who don\u2019t know them.\nSome South Koreans are also concerned about their bellies. They find that it is too hard to get rid of the stomach fat when they try. Some don\u2019t know how to lose weight. Some of them just think that they will be able to get rid of it overnight.\nWhile the weight of the girls will be lifted when they get married, that weight never goes away completely.\nHowever, as they get older, the body begins to change again, so once you have dropped the weight, you will find that it has returned.\nSome women suffer all the while trying to stay as slender as possible. Those women will often say, \u201cI don\u2019t eat that much, but it still goes right back onto me.\u201d\nIf you read the book Women, Food & Work, you will be able to get some ideas on the problem that you may be having. At first glance, this book seems like an encyclopedia filled with everything.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation to fund the federal government for two weeks , giving congressional negotiators more time to work out budget priorities through next September and other thorny policy matters","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation to fund the federal government for two weeks, giving congressional negotiators more time to work out budget priorities through next September and other thorny policy matters such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nWhile Trump said he did not accept the need for a government shutdown and he was pleased that the legislation had passed Congress, his comments indicated that he could be more flexible on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he told reporters after visiting a Veterans Affairs facility. However, he also reiterated that he did not have an agreement with TPP members and that all options remained on the table.\nWhen asked if he would make a trade deal a top priority, Trump said that he would \u201cnever put TPP over working with Mexico and China.\u201d The president hinted at the possibility of holding a meeting with Beijing\u2019s President Xi Jinping when he returned to Washington from New York on Thursday, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as with leaders of other countries.\nSome lawmakers are worried that the inability to fund the federal government during the fiscal year from September 1 to August 31 means that many critical services will be jeopardised. More than 60 services have either been curtailed or partially suspended.\nDuring a tour of the Veterans Affairs hospital to thank doctors and nurses for their dedicated work during the Trump administration, the president also declared that the US government was one of \u201cthe best systems in the world.\u201d While he praised the federal health system, he acknowledged that it is \u201cnot all peaches and cream, but it is the best health care and treatment system we\u2019ve ever had in the world.\u201d\nA US administration official said that the Trump administration expects to close the fiscal gap by September 16 and, if the legislators are cooperative, he expected that a deal for funding the federal government would be reached by Friday.\n\u201cAny deal would be better than not making any deal,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cThere is no other option for Congress than to come to an agreement.\u201d\nPreviously it has not been easy to get the best deal for all the people that use the federal government, especially for the hard working tax paying people of Arizona.\nI don\u2019t believe the US is the best system in the world, it is the poorest system. The US has a lot of medical issues and that is not covered by their system. The US has not taken care of the poor people of the world as much as they should.\nOn the other hand the government is not working as it should be that is why we have all these issues. If the government starts to make good medical decisions then the people will love the government more.\nI love when they are in office, they do so much for us.

{"prompt":"China called on all parties on Friday to exercise restraint after North Korea \u2019 s foreign minister was quoted as saying he believes the North could consider conducting a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific","text":"China called on all parties on Friday to exercise restraint after North Korea \u2019 s foreign minister was quoted as saying he believes the North could consider conducting a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific at any time, The claim has not been officially denied by the North Koreans.The South\u2019s Foreign Ministry stressed in a statement that the issue of peace and security in North Korea is China\u2019s fundamental interest.\nIn the latest comments by foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, he noted that a bomb test would be against the \u201cwill\u201d of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. China will take further \u201cappropriate\u201d measures to prevent this, Lu said. According to the United Nations, North Korea last declared that they would not be involved in any act of provocative behavior, which includes the possibility of a bomb test.\nIn the interview, however, Kim Yong Chol emphasized that \u201cthere is always an option to be done.\u201d If I don\u2019t live in Kim Jong Un\u2019s pocket, I will use any means we need. \u201d.It\u2019s clear from the interview that the North\u2019s foreign minister is now saying that the North can test a hydrogen bomb at any point in the future.\nIf they are trying to test a hydrogen bomb for that reason alone, and that the South has now warned that it can be very dangerous, The military action of the North is clearly possible.But the North is also worried that in the confrontation, the United States will react to the North with more pressure, and therefore any possible action by Kim Jong Un can be a last resort, which North Korea does not want.\nThe North Koreans would probably want to avoid conflict because the South sees the North as its main economic source, and there would be more sanctions if they had a test. And the North\u2019s current main economic lifeline is China. China has supported the North for decades, and many companies are located in the North, so a conflict between the two countries could have disastrous economic consequences for the North.\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear program has been hotly debated for several years, but the North Koreans have not stopped nuclear development. The South has called on China to take a harder role, and China has repeatedly defended the regime. In 2018 the two countries came to an agreement to keep the nuclear weapons programs in check.But it was not until December of last year that North Korea started to freeze its nuclear program, and President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States will be able to hold negotiations with North Korea under the next administration. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, did not show any signs of changing course, saying he does not see a solution for the South Korean issue, leaving open questions about how North Korea will react in the future.\nThe U.S. has already announced military operations in the South, but North Korea has not shown any signs of complying with the agreement.\nOn the surface, it does not appear to be a very big game, but there are certain differences that make the game completely unique.\nTo make it more interesting, the game has been given a unique map and different difficulty levels. The developers have also tried to implement certain features which will make the gameplay even more realistic.

{"prompt":"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused the United States of plotting to withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty , which bans short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles . Both Russia and","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused the United States of plotting to withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which bans short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles. Both Russia and the United States signed the treaty in 1987. The treaty, which Moscow says has improved the security of the two countries, comes under strain because of U.S. concerns that Iran is violating it in several ways. In his comments to Russian and international reporters in Moscow, Putin accused the U.S. of \"undermining this treaty,\" adding that the treaty was crucial to the stability of the world. \"It's difficult to explain the reasons for continuing to observe a treaty and then, at the same time, make criticisms,\" he said of Washington. Putin said the treaty was not a foregone conclusion, but said Russia, which has long maintained a number of strategic nuclear weapons, believes it is worth observing. He noted that the United States and Russia have been partners on the United Nations since the Cold War and believed the two countries \"have a common interest, in strengthening stability and in creating a secure international order.\" However, Putin said Iran has \"strongly disarmed\" following Moscow and Washington's removal of sanctions imposed on the country for years for its development of nuclear weapons. Putin said Iran has signed agreements limiting its nuclear program with six world powers that include the U.S., France, Germany, Russia, Britain and China. Putin said Iran and Moscow agreed to the new sanctions after a Moscow-based group of European nations called for them. He said the agreements will continue until March 15, when Iran should submit its progress on its nuclear program to the United Nations. On the way back to Moscow from Kazakhstan, where he signed agreements to develop energy ties with Kazakhstan, Putin was quoted by TASS news agency as saying, \"No matter how big the international community is, we must always have our own interests.\" According to the U.S. Department of State's office of arms control and international security, on Thursday, Iran said that it had no plans to dismantle or disable any of its nuclear facilities in violation of a key nuclear pact it signed with world powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Friday that the United States' withdrawal from the Intermediate range nuclear forces (INF) treaty was a serious provocation, adding that the treaty is a powerful element of strategic stability and security. \"We cannot speak of disarmament, when even the most powerful nuclear-armed country with the greatest strategic balance chooses to violate the INF treaty. It is an outrageous act and we see this as being very provocative,\" Lavrov said on the sidelines of an International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna. Russia is the guarantor of the treaty, which came into effect in 1987. The treaty, which banned all types of land-based missiles and warheads with ranges of less than 500 kilometres (about 345 miles), has come under strain from U.S. concerns that Iran, along with North Korea, could unilaterally use the missiles prohibited under the treaty. The Trump Administration has said that it believes Iran has breached the INF with the Iranian missile program and has proposed strengthening the treaty's existing guidelines and other provisions to enforce compliance by members. The treaty came into effect 20 years ago.

{"prompt":"Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said on Thursday Moscow was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from Syria , Russian news agencies reported . Preparations are underway , RIA news agency quoted Patrushev","text":"Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said on Thursday Moscow was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, Russian news agencies reported. Preparations are underway, RIA news agency quoted Patrushev as saying. The move is expected to take place from Moscow by a squadron of Mirage-2000 fighter jets and a unit of troops, it said. In the same news agency, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said the decision will be taken for Moscow's security. \"It will be based on the current situation in the Syrian conflict. The decision to withdraw will be taken soon,\" he said. \"We are working on preparations, and this will go down soon,\" Grushko added. The Russian official went on to argue that the decision will go in line with Moscow's policy of engaging diplomatically with various nations in the Syrian crisis rather than forcefully intervening militarily. In an interview with the publication online Newsru, Grushko further explained a possible reason for Moscow's decision to withdraw from Syria. \"So far, the Syrian government has been unable to control a certain part of the country,\" he said. \"So Moscow, in the context of diplomatic efforts, decided to withdraw. A military component would have meant military intervention, and what we say to our partners is that we are ready to talk, but we would rather be able to put aside in a peaceful way, if necessary, military intervention.\" Russia's move marks the latest attempt to limit its impact in the Syrian crisis, which has already drawn condemnation from all corners of the world. The withdrawal of the military could give the US more breathing space, if the Kremlin intends to step up its diplomatic role in the Syrian conflict. Moscow has already announced last week that it will support a Russian-Israeli deal on the Syrian crisis. However, the agreement still requires Syria to implement the proposal. As part of the new deal, President Syrian Bashar al-Assad, who faces military opposition, would stop using chemical weapons over the span of 10 months and allow international experts and observers to monitor its use of deadly weapons. Russia has already made the agreement official and has agreed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the plan. Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to the US has announced he will leave Washington next week, with the official news agency TASS saying that Yuri Ushakov is on his way back to Russia. Ushakov will return to Russia on April 14, a TASS news agency correspondent said, adding that he would leave in the morning on business, The US ambassador to Moscow, John Tefft, also announced that he will step down on April 14. Tefft has been the US ambassador to Moscow since October of last year. As The News International reports, Tefft has been in a \"very bad spot\" with regards to the US's opposition to Moscow. The diplomat said last month that the US \"was going to go after all of Russia\". In a tweet, Tefft noted he had \"worked diligently with President Obama and Vice-President Joe Biden to bring American troops home and to work with the Russian Government to increase international

{"prompt":"The Syrian government s delegation returned to Geneva on Sunday for the resumption of talks with United Nations mediator Staffan de Mistura after more than a week s absence , but Western diplomats voiced scepticism","text":"The Syrian government s delegation returned to Geneva on Sunday for the resumption of talks with United Nations mediator Staffan de Mistura after more than a week s absence, but Western diplomats voiced scepticism and accused the Syrian regime of refusing to come to the negotiating table. The Syrian Foreign Ministry rejected any accusations that the Syrian government s delegation had been absent for a week or that the Syrian government s representatives did n t have to sign an agreement to attend negotiations, accusing the US, Britain and Spain of not giving a negotiating mandate to the Syrian government. Syrian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jihad Awad said the delegations must meet before and during the next round of negotiations, as a part of political progress. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the US, Britain and France of using chemical attacks on civilians in Syria as a pretext to initiate military action against the country, saying Syria had committed no such violations. The Syrian Army and National Defense Force responded promptly and decisively to this crime, and its military actions were targeted at criminal gangs who use chemical weapons and other destructive weapons against their own peoples and against innocent civilians, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Awad. The Foreign Ministry denounced the British and American intervention in the Syrian conflict, calling it a flagrant violation of the principles of international law, a betrayal of their trust in Syria, and an attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs. In a statement yesterday, the British Foreign Office said that no chemical weapons attack in Syria was reported at the time the coalition s operations were conducted at different times yesterday. The US, for their part, called it a matter of urgent concern because of the risks posed for civilians and military observers. It is particularly disturbing that at least two bombs have been set off on the frontline of the Syrian government s air and artillery batteries. The US has committed itself to taking the necessary steps to ensure that these weapons are brought to safety, the statement said. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on the US to take immediate measures to minimize the possible risks posed to civilians living in the vicinity of an US military base in Iraq and the US s bombing exercises in Syria, saying the US is acting against the interests of all of the international community, including Syria. Russia told the UN that it did not expect the US to take effective measures to mitigate the impact of airstrikes that would be carried out in Syria if a political conference called for by secretary general Antonio Guterres fails to agree to a cessation of hostilities. The US has repeatedly condemned its airstrikes in Syria as unnecessary and potentially dangerous to civilians, arguing its use of fighter jets was a response to the use of chemical weapons, as well as to protect US forces and allied troops and facilities, and not aimed at Syria s government. The use of airstrikes in Syria by the US had caused more than 200 deaths, including 80 by fire, since March, according to a report released by the Syria Foundation in London on Wednesday. The report, compiled by a group of independent analysts based in Britain, Iraq and France, and cited by the Financial Times, said that airstrikes by the US and its allies had killed nearly 200 civilians since March of this year. Some 60 people have died in Syria from airstrikes since the US sent fighter jets to the Middle East more than a year ago to combat militias believed to be backed by Iran. The group said an additional 21 civilians had died.","token_len":677,"entropy":[9.1918,1.7877,10.2367,15.6343,5.309,0.4456,3.9319,1.252,2.2768,2.7105,1.8048,8.7696,0.0081,0.0212,0.5889,1.8165,6.0929,0.1665,3.8807,0.9779,1.3691,0.0003,0.0008,0.0001,0.0,4.109,3.2664,0.0031,1.6948,0.9774,9.8502,7.0011,2.3092,3.5268,7.9881,1.2281,6.8147,3.5107,0.005,4.6405,4.8156,1.1242,1.4088,2.3637,0.0601,5.8817,0.1068,5.5461,0.3344,1.4383,1.2591,0.0051,0.4076,3.2915,2.1825,3.612,0.2477,5.4014,3.1166,4.3561,1.0325,1.0632,1.5411,0.6544,6.1151,0.8485,0.8084,1.6275,4.3537,2.2623,2.7765,1.4736,2.7548,2.9511,1.8819,1.8069,0.8153,1.8795,4.3507,4.9203,11.1685,4.296,2.6335,4.2417,6.3805,2.9211,0.5538,1.5776,3.4385,3.6108,2.7366,6.6784,0.994,4.0714,2.9477,1.9374,0.5473,6.977,0.2237,3.7885,4.3886,2.7685,7.9654,4.072,0.9053,0.8927,1.2654,0.4525,1.3236,4.4666,1.063,2.0468,3.4608,0.0097,0.8423,5.3638,5.7926,0.0697,0.5919,1.3394,6.1203,0.0013,5.8743,3.5336,4.1977,5.542,2.0607,0.5297,2.2704,1.7933,0.0504,1.6336,1.7774,4.0475,3.7794,5.0194,0.0017,8.4072,5.4832,0.9735,6.5256,0.1934,4.751,0.48,0.1393,0.4821,0.0,4.3693,0.3936,1.0563,2.265,0.8744,0.1809,1.4469,0.0579,4.2175,4.0502,4.4342,1.8196,0.5117,1.5002,0.783,1.7429,0.9653,0.3761,0.4554,7.0288,1.6869,0.6617,1.1586,0.9844,3.3858,2.3518,2.3335,5.3803,1.8503,5.2648,3.3264,3.4466,4.245,0.4357,2.2853,2.3671,6.218,2.6938,4.2468,1.5196,3.5147,6.1717,8.7213,3.1132,4.4172,0.8736,5.6461,9.5766,1.1347,2.5271,5.9423,3.1091,5.7165,1.8333,5.4394,1.8926,9.496,4.2102,3.7641,3.7767,0.6965,0.0883,2.5161,2.5689,5.051,0.9569,1.9113,3.5089,0.5412,6.9595,2.1352,2.9886,3.7598,0.5001,1.5372,2.7372,0.0036,5.4534,0.2936,1.3571,5.7041,0.0496,0.0005,0.1578,1.9,5.1126,0.0825,5.9978,0.5368,7.5787,1.2456,4.2377,4.6614,0.8245,1.8693,1.0958,1.2439,1.1947,2.3266,0.799,1.1583,6.8294,0.0039,0.4127,0.0291,1.9861,3.6898,0.1296,0.4118,0.1688,2.0863,3.9067,5.868,0.1087,3.8637,4.7487,0.6729,3.4363,1.6635,0.2698,1.9346,1.59,0.2985,6.0702,0.4857,3.6679,4.4634,0.2477,0.274,3.9991,0.7309,0.6505,6.5392,0.2325,0.902,4.0321,0.5929,0.7945,0.4114,1.7529,5.0381,3.8711,0.3604,2.7827,2.8441,0.1534,1.6107,4.774,3.6982,0.4921,0.3833,3.0675,4.8766,5.716,5.4915,0.8867,2.5056,6.4493,8.1161,1.9497,8.9171,0.8936,1.467,4.0943,2.3579,5.9581,5.8238,0.0019,0.0032,2.8915,2.7092,0.835,4.971,0.1988,5.7025,1.0126,4.3673,1.4842,0.4386,5.5639,1.7008,7.3166,1.3566,1.5187,4.1199,6.711,1.0368,2.9094,3.8617,5.1375,3.3783,0.5396,5.0329,1.585,2.0559,6.0315,2.467,0.2296,5.3903,0.2554,2.2844,1.5689,7.1793,0.8404,0.6078,1.3329,3.8661,1.5251,5.3771,3.9461,2.0916,5.8089,1.9996,1.1878,2.1013,2.0467,6.2253,2.1737,0.1902,4.5718,2.7376,0.6761,1.0377,0.1505,2.3585,0.682,4.1461,2.8812,1.0142,3.385,1.1353,3.4725,1.7955,2.8143,1.4253,0.2871,0.2279,1.4388,4.1521,0.4483,0.081,4.3129,0.1753,0.3536,2.5457,0.7699,0.6705,2.4926,0.9503,2.53,2.0586,3.1199,0.232,4.8156,0.8845,4.6353,3.1245,1.2959,1.2815,0.6656,6.0062,0.426,1.0747,1.8905,0.0935,5.6629,7.7848,1.9891,1.0095,1.3755,4.5053,1.5288,2.7845,3.3221,7.6139,5.6819,8.9276,1.2238,0.7231,2.1574,3.0475,1.6309,1.6445,3.3044,4.8163,3.9196,1.3593,1.4478,0.0187,3.2278,2.8787,1.947,4.314,0.0303,2.0764,0.9118,2.6885,0.6612,3.4449,6.486,0.9133,1.5029,1.3757,1.2561,4.1645,0.03,4.0403,1.0521,1.2077,0.5215,2.3374,5.7862,1.7598,0.6802,4.525,0.4017,3.8884,0.1001,5.5793,3.8921,3.6589,1.9299,1.0015,0.0021,1.9932,0.8553,4.4911,4.2415,4.6195,7.8087,5.3591,1.9806,3.3442,10.8253,0.7317,4.3693,0.0016,0.0006,0.0001,4.165,0.3877,3.5011,1.1131,1.2733,3.6451,0.0539,0.0658,0.6925,1.6323,1.9628,1.7506,2.9174,3.7942,3.8997,4.3642,1.0079,0.1173,3.0663,5.3812,0.5582,7.2245,2.285,3.2046,1.1058,1.2287,5.0453,6.1574,1.7303,0.5666,9.5817,0.2094,3.2352,3.0189,3.8846,0.0644,1.4335,2.4208,0.0674,1.1696,0.0328,2.8528,3.4346,0.3303,0.0028,1.4016,4.8563,2.8489,2.6999,2.4766,4.8884,2.325,3.8063,3.9206,2.8711,2.0749,4.6015,5.7836,0.1055,4.5872,3.9626,3.1823,1.5235,1.4222,5.2523,0.0212,5.2026,1.6111,0.1725,3.5373,0.4183,0.4188,6.3788,4.3659,5.1211,0.4281,3.2402,1.1034,1.5913,1.3909,5.8639,5.45,8.0533,1.625,3.5163,3.2745,1.6908,1.4697,0.001,2.8215,1.8711,2.2996,0.8279,0.5756,5.9374,4.5375,2.9259,4.985,1.703,2.8082,0.1962,1.1917,1.7086,2.1027,4.2366,0.2056,3.114,2.2804,0.4209,3.9194,1.9687,3.5183,0.2359,3.129,0.4091,5.8279,0.5445,4.664,0.099,4.9113,4.5523,0.4442,0.9559,6.0925,0.0037,0.3916,0.9902,1.1915,4.9095,2.0066,0.6543,0.2988,2.1271,0.9771,0.292,1.5621,1.3169,4.3134,3.1796,0.8557,1.9407,0.6614,5.0958,0.7919,0.0034,0.7754,5.3128,3.9649,2.3421,1.245,1.0765,1.1983,2.6459,4.7046,4.1726,1.9967,1.4656,3.9879,6.4814,4.3633,0.0821,0.6671,1.8264,5.2942,0.1121,6.821,0.0099,0.9771,0.2788,0.0141,2.0971,3.8099,9.3911,6.3733,0.0327,0.2402,2.01,0.0151,1.7869,1.0527,1.3197,3.6201,0.7311,5.4745,3.1063,5.5189,1.2977,1.6004,1.2186,3.5398]}

{"prompt":"Haitian immigrants on Tuesday decried a U.S. decision to end a program that granted 59,000 Haitians temporary visas after the 2010 earthquake , saying they would be sent back to a country that has yet","text":"Haitian immigrants on Tuesday decried a U.S. decision to end a program that granted 59,000 Haitians temporary visas after the 2010 earthquake, saying they would be sent back to a country that has yet to recover from the devastating quake.\n\"The American citizen president is playing games with our hopes. I'm angry because we don't know why,\" Jose Carlos Hernandez told AFP after a deportation at Fort Haines, Colorado.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection announced on Tuesday that it would reduce that number to 10,000, ending the program for eligible Haitian immigrants who had already been stamped green cards by the end of this year.\nThe announcement has prompted widespread condemnation from Haitian immigrants living in the United States and those who are awaiting U.S. government protection.\nThe program grants permanent residency to nearly 6,000 individuals, primarily Haitians, who entered the U.S. after the earthquake and would not qualify for temporary visas under U.S. immigration laws.\nThe Haitian government estimates a nearly 2 percent of that population still living in the U.S., or about 57,000 people, all of whom would be eligible for deportation under Trump's decision.\n\"They will not be allowed to stay in our country, the U.S. can't send them here. They will leave our country,\" said Jose Carlos Hernandez, a Haitian immigrant who lost his house to the quake.\nJosefina Nereo, a Haitian who survived the quake but is awaiting official asylum at a refugee camp in Dallas, told AFP the decision was \"disgusting\" to them.\n\"We are a family waiting for asylum since March 2012, they are not going to go to a country that doesn't have anything,\" she said.\nThe U.S. government says refugees from the earthquake live in camps in the countryside and are not in the immediate danger zone.\n\"The Haitians do not know that U.S. law allows them to get visas on humanitarian grounds,\" the U.S. Department of State told AFP.\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his decision to end the program, saying: \"Alleged threats to U.S. national security don't mean any more.\"\nSeveral senators on Tuesday called for the Trump administration to rescind the decision.\n\"We urge the administration to rescind this cruel proposal now that the President has said his administration is no longer considering deporting those who enter our country,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-OH.\nThe Obama administration implemented temporary visas for unaccompanied children under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012. But that program has since expired.\nTrump argues that U.S. border security would suffer if Haitians were allowed to live the way they did in the aftermath of the earthquake. In 2010, they had little or no legal status, while some who survived the earthquake faced deportation.\nThose Haitians in the U.S. are also in jeopardy of deportation if they do not apply for green

{"prompt":"The United Nations political affairs chief will visit North Korea this week , making the highest-level visit by a U.N. official in more than six years as tensions grip the region over Pyongyang s nuclear","text":"The United Nations political affairs chief will visit North Korea this week, making the highest-level visit by a U.N. official in more than six years as tensions grip the region over Pyongyang s nuclear program.\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Pyongyang on Thursday and Friday to meet with his North Korean counterpart and speak with the ruling dictator Kim Jong Il, who is in his early sixties. The United States has criticized the visit, saying it could be used as cover for provocative U.N.-sponsored talks for the North to engage with the United States.\nMr. Ban will be the first top U.N. official to visit North Korea in more than six years. In 2007, he visited the island of Guam, which is the second-busiest U.S. military base in the world.\nMr. Ban was unable to address a North Korean audience when he visited New York in September due to U.S. travel restrictions and to comply with sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council following a nuclear test last year in August.\nHe described his decision to return to North Korea as a \"privilege, not privilege-ride\" in one speech.\nMr. Ban described the visit as \"probably the first time a high-ranking UN official... will travel to North Korea,\" the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo said.\nThe trip will represent a major escalation of U.N. diplomacy, which came at a dramatic time for diplomacy in Asia following the test and Kim Jr s death earlier this year.\nDiplomacians said North Korea is in a \"very sensitive, volatile period in its history.\"\nMr. Ban will tour the capital city, Pyongyang, which is largely deserted at this time of year and not normally the best place to meet an isolated regime. But Mr. Ban emphasized during a visit to South Korea this week that he wished to visit Pyongyang because his work in Asia \"has not always been easy.\"\nA report by the CIA says North Korea plans at least four more nuclear tests in the next five to five and a half years.\nEven as the North appears to be increasingly isolated from the outside world, its top leaders have met more times in recent weeks.\nKim Jong Il has met with the Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, and even visited a popular soccer ground where fans cheered him and his entourage on.\nKim Jong Il and U.S. President Barack Obama took joint statements at the summit of the G20 in Cannes in late June, an effort the two leaders characterized as a breakthrough to easing tensions.\nAnalysts have also said that Mr. Obama expressed a readiness to talk more directly with Mr. Kim on the issue of Pyongyang s nuclear program, an activity the West has blamed for his regime s longstanding isolation from the outside world.\nBut Mr. Ban said in a July 28 interview on CNN that the United States \"has not shown much interest in engaging with us to resolve the impasse\" on the North s nuclear program.\nMr. Ban did

{"prompt":"A Swiss federal court has dismissed the asylum appeal of a woman convicted in Spain of supporting the Basque separatist group ETA , but said she was now free to remain in Switzerland after Madrid","text":"A Swiss federal court has dismissed the asylum appeal of a woman convicted in Spain of supporting the Basque separatist group ETA, but said she was now free to remain in Switzerland after Madrid ordered her repatriation.\nThe Federal Court ruled that the deportation order issued by the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry was not unlawful because she had been deported from the country in July. But it said it required a new legal assessment of the person's application for asylum.\nThe woman, known only as Evelyne, has called numerous times for an international prosecution for her participation in the 2004 assassination of the Spanish parliamentarian for the Andalusian Socialist-PSOE party Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco.\nIn a last-minute bid to avoid deportation, Madrid had asked the court Friday to order the Swiss police to help Evelyne. With her deportation order in hand, the police would be able to forcibly remove her.\nThe woman had left Spain in February. She had applied to enter Switzerland six days earlier, to live with her husband there. On April 18, she applied for asylum. On August 10, 2009 she was convicted for supporting the ETA group and sentenced to five years in prison. She appealed, and was cleared in 2012, as she claimed her conviction was based on false confessions.\nShe then appealed to the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights in April 2013 because she claimed there was no evidence of her participation in the assassination of Blanco. In its December 20 ruling the court said the UN's authority had not been proven.\nIn a statement on Friday, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Spain reiterated its willingness \"exclusively\" to return the woman to Spain. The spokesman, Rafael Baena, called the decision of the Federal Court \"fr\u00edvola e incomprensible\" and claimed he did not understand why they had taken so long to rule on it.\n\"She has shown an excessive hesitation, in violation of a previous ruling,\" Baena told AFP.\nThe woman lived in Spain since she was 18 years old, which means she had left her country of birth. According to the Immigration Office, she has the right to remain in the country.\nAt the end of 2015, Spain accepted 2,037 asylum applications for people having fled to the country in recent years, compared with nearly 10,000 in the full 2014 and in the preceding five years. Spain became a country of transit, receiving asylum seekers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.\nSpain and Switzerland signed earlier this year a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition of refugee cases and the return of illegally entered migrants and their descendants.\nThey were among the countries who refused to participate in the EU-Turkey agreement in March.\nItaly, too, had ordered the return to Algeria of an Italian asylum seeker convicted of crimes related to terrorism.\nIn January 2016, the European Court of Human Rights judged that Italy had not respected the right of the defendant to challenge the sentencing against him and that he should have been given a full trial.\nThe case is likely to result in a fine of more than 100,000 euros from the Italian government, for

The bill includes tax cuts of $1,200 as well as $500 per dependent child. It also includes increases in the top tax rate as well as increases in the income tax [ \u2026 ] More \u00bb\nAn estimated 50 million Americans, or more than a quarter of the population, have had or have had high blood pressure. While a normal blood pressure is less than 120\/80, high blood pressure is often defined as having any systolic blood pressure over 140 (140 or higher) or any diastolic blood pressure over 90 (90 or higher). And for those with heart disease, high blood pressure is the most common risk factor. It\u2019s not easy to get your blood pressure under control and one way to do that is to maintain a healthy weight. A person that is overweight can have an increased risk of high blood pressure just as much or even more than a person who is not overweight. When your body is overweight, the pressure of the blood against the walls of your blood vessels can increase, which is called \u201chypertension.\u201d\nOne of the ways that individuals can manage their blood pressure is to eat a healthy diet. Foods high in nutrients and low in processed and junk foods can be very important for high blood pressure management. When eating low sodium foods and a diet high in potassium and other nutrient-rich foods, blood pressure can be reduced. In fact, there has been a strong correlation between having a lower blood pressure and having a higher intake of potassium, omega-3, as well as fruits and vegetables. Low sodium foods, foods rich in potassium foods such as bananas and broccoli, and foods high in fiber have been shown to reduce your blood pressure. For the most part, you\u2019ll just want to stay away from food rich in processed fats and trans fats, along with foods rich in high glycemic carbs and foods high in salt. One of the ways that individuals can get a more healthy diet and lower their risk of high blood pressure is to get started at the grocery store or the farmers market and try to find produce that is locally sourced, where it can be less expensive and also fresher.\nOne of the most common symptoms associated with high blood pressure is that of having poor circulation. For some people, it can also lead to severe pain in their legs and feet if they cannot have enough blood circulation. People who are experiencing such symptoms should see their physician or the local urgent care center to receive medical treatment.

{"prompt":"Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Friday that President Donald Trump \u2019 s rejection of the Paris climate change agreement was fueling , rather than weakening , momentum among environmental activists . Gore","text":"Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Friday that President Donald Trump \u2019 s rejection of the Paris climate change agreement was fueling, rather than weakening, momentum among environmental activists. Gore said, \u201cThat he\u2019s refusing to go to the climate negotiations to hammer out new climate change commitments and \u2026 that he\u2019s going after the EPA instead is obviously something that is fueling this resistance to change and the fight among people for change.\u201d The Paris agreement was reached to combat climate disruption by the U.S. under President Barack Obama in 2016. It calls for limiting global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius (3-4 Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial levels. Trump has refused to sign the accord because the United States withdrew from the agreement. While many Republicans voted in favor of a bill in the U.S. Senate that would block Trump from removing the U.S. from the agreement, the president has still refused to sign the bill.\nWhen The Daily News first reached out to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations over the situation, he said that Trump has not asked for the U.S. to be removed from the United Nations. The diplomat said Trump has \u201cremained neutral.\u201d On Thursday, The Daily News reported that a number of conservative Republicans told Trump that he should remove the United States from the Paris agreement before its 2020 deadline. Trump reportedly told his top advisors that he would decide what to do once he gets his act together.\nIn fact, many conservative Republicans, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, told members of Congress to tell Trump that he should remove the United States from the Paris climate deal. On Thursday, Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Cindy Hyde-Schmid reintroduced a bill that would block Trump from removing the U.S. from the agreement. Other conservative Republican senators have already made it clear that they will not block Trump in order to protect American jobs.\nFormer Vice President Al Gore said on Friday that Trump\u2019s rejection of the Paris climate agreement is fueling, rather than weakening, momentum among environmental activists.\n\u201cThat he\u2019s refusing to go to the climate negotiations to hammer out new climate change commitments and \u2026 that he\u2019s going after the EPA instead is obviously something that is fueling this resistance to change and the fight among people for change,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThis is not an endorsement for President Trump. For anybody who wants to take our country in a new direction because of COVID, that\u2019s an opportunity to do it. I would hope that all our political leaders at some point will look at what we need to do here to put America on the path of a new vision for clean economy and put climate change at the forefront of our national discourse.\u201d\nGore said that Americans are becoming aware of the climate crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said, \u201can outpouring of anger for this and it\u2019s inspiring and it leads to the next step. I don\u2019t think it should be discouraging but what it calls for is that we stand as one people, as a country and show that to the world we are not a nation driven by fossil fuels, by an oil industry, to take out on the global community by taking out the United

{"prompt":"Cooperation between China and the United States will lead to a win-win outcome for both sides , but confrontation will bring mutual losses , China said on Tuesday , after the United States branded it","text":"Cooperation between China and the United States will lead to a win-win outcome for both sides, but confrontation will bring mutual losses, China said on Tuesday, after the United States branded it an unfriendly ally and slapped sanctions against 11 Chinese officials.\nU.S. Treasury and Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security announced sanctions against 11 people and two companies following the detention of a U.S. citizen in China and the release of the detained American, a top official at the Chinese consulate said.\nChina warned the U.S. government and Congress of \"grave consequences\" if sanctions were imposed.\nA senior official at the U.S. embassy in Beijing said the American embassy would not comment on the sanctions but said the U.S. should not punish another country with threats.\nBeijing has refused to comment on the Americans being released into the custody of China.\n\"For us, it is important at all times to have communication with the U.S.,\" said Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the foreign ministry.\n\"We have a very strong sense of ownership and pride. We are willing to work together with the U.S. to seek practical solutions, including through dialogue and consultation, not confrontation in this area, \"said Zhao.\nHe added that the diplomatic ties between China and the United States are important for the interests of both countries.\nZhao said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to seek a solution, including through dialogue and consultation, not to resort to confrontation in this area.\nIn the statement, the Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security said that the U.S. government has designated 14 Chinese officers and two entities associated with them for their role in detaining Liu Xiaobo, Beijing's leading human rights activist and Nobel Laureate in 2008.\nChina said it takes a very strong position against the U.S. decision to brand ties between China and the United States as \"unfriendly\" and to impose sanctions against the Chinese people.\nZhao said the United States had a lot to gain by establishing good ties with China.\nHe added that China and the United States had an opportunity to work together to promote peace, stability, development, and prosperity in their region.\nThe Chinese statement does not elaborate on alleged human rights violations of U.S citizens in China.\nThe announcement comes after the U.S. State Department released a statement that warned that China risks losing U.S. business and trade by refusing to allow the American to be released.\n\"It shows how the American political world is still stuck in the Cold War mentality, which is clearly ineffective in solving problems,\" Zhao told reporters on a visit to Iran.\nHe said the U.S. actions were completely unacceptable and not worthy of a country with a strong international reputation.\nZhao said his country has never violated international human rights rules, nor taken measures to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.\n\"In the past, I have been quoted to say with pride that the political system in China is superior to that of the West. No matter what side you stand on, people can talk to the opposite side in China,\" he said.\n\"I would like people to give China a more reasonable evaluation in this regard. I would like to give a very positive reflection on the human rights situation in China today,\" he said.","token_len":682,"entropy":[9.9504,3.3775,5.8704,0.1487,1.1625,1.3726,0.0451,3.5943,4.2112,0.0651,1.7256,7.4644,0.4925,0.0125,3.735,0.9753,1.5316,0.8633,1.6649,2.8929,10.3522,1.728,5.2956,6.2707,6.1575,2.6671,4.1552,2.0794,2.9751,2.0856,1.8002,3.49,1.6539,1.5585,0.0217,10.1855,2.3869,2.0084,7.0257,0.0157,0.0004,4.9101,1.7915,5.5033,2.2721,3.0556,6.8644,1.9437,2.4206,1.1873,0.2954,18.1142,0.0061,0.0302,0.042,3.8866,4.364,8.4076,0.0173,0.0432,1.7982,0.9266,3.9294,0.0007,4.0468,2.9959,1.2542,2.0379,1.941,2.0793,3.0267,1.0794,6.2354,1.5686,7.7952,0.3131,1.8695,2.4059,0.0008,0.0071,0.0309,0.648,1.3231,0.5297,3.8158,1.6222,2.9205,0.0569,3.8455,2.3962,2.9963,2.4796,2.7919,4.3308,2.1585,3.3767,0.373,2.0033,3.758,1.4011,0.6516,0.3342,1.6485,6.027,1.2372,0.7094,0.0007,0.0027,0.0417,3.7719,3.6531,4.5507,3.399,2.3656,3.5636,0.6372,0.2144,0.4022,7.7601,0.5856,2.2027,1.7458,0.459,4.2191,2.1949,2.5753,0.7186,0.3581,2.0596,0.0004,0.0416,0.0987,1.5294,0.1,0.0922,0.7955,0.9581,4.2926,4.4451,2.2754,1.884,1.1909,0.3942,1.0337,4.3909,3.0487,1.6484,1.2597,1.3325,0.0005,0.0021,0.0196,4.8297,2.3056,5.7146,5.6059,0.2164,3.3358,5.9288,1.6793,0.2307,4.7208,0.0004,1.5223,5.7754,0.1396,3.5119,0.21,0.5375,6.307,3.7135,4.9854,6.6166,0.8751,3.0729,0.0619,3.2331,1.3619,0.4806,3.3898,5.5501,3.2351,0.6876,1.5267,0.7889,3.1558,7.6609,2.5319,0.1067,0.6459,4.077,6.6221,0.6013,1.2587,2.2816,0.0007,0.0026,3.2447,1.0088,4.7829,5.2904,1.0972,2.6877,0.1257,7.1579,3.0862,0.4169,3.8131,0.1407,0.8336,0.6983,3.5468,1.3043,2.4066,2.8907,3.2183,1.7688,5.9987,0.3587,9.8066,1.4605,7.7167,3.9855,0.8971,2.0369,3.9208,0.0463,1.9424,2.0673,1.7378,1.5127,1.4255,0.0008,0.0024,0.283,1.0869,6.1095,7.0463,0.1671,2.9884,2.8339,3.852,1.5647,1.2458,5.1657,1.4371,5.4778,3.6655,5.6016,3.4272,2.7394,3.8047,5.318,4.1898,0.7522,0.7396,0.1785,4.1163,1.4784,0.3225,1.1452,5.6202,4.6417,0.354,1.6264,0.0192,0.13,0.2951,0.0018,2.3794,4.4461,1.5967,1.7772,5.6385,0.0164,0.7692,0.5461,0.6601,0.1994,5.3394,0.0222,0.7091,3.858,2.3905,2.6053,0.0244,1.1229,0.3315,2.7703,0.9274,4.1536,1.8206,1.6083,2.695,3.0217,2.0038,0.4971,0.1939,0.0608,0.3895,1.5223,10.2587,6.1724,0.0094,2.2485,1.6592,0.7035,0.0433,0.3907,0.194,3.9146,2.5943,4.0844,0.3864,0.6325,8.4026,0.0089,0.0512,0.4754,0.4118,0.3023,0.0021,0.6728,2.5365,1.1287,1.269,0.0007,0.0017,0.0343,1.4144,2.4727,6.0179,5.8716,2.342,6.052,2.0855,4.3744,6.9854,4.8211,0.0124,6.9149,2.6629,4.2745,2.6751,0.0815,5.6823,0.0139,8.4761,0.65,0.2089,0.684,6.7893,0.0372,5.333,2.464,0.0218,0.8363,1.6084,4.1633,3.7347,0.0106,2.7822,4.7316,0.3832,0.5491,2.9061,2.6322,2.1548,6.8167,3.3461,3.9685,2.1479,1.3927,0.8074,2.2609,2.2251,0.0004,0.0045,0.3066,6.2594,0.4888,11.1139,8.9052,1.0812,1.5057,0.0171,0.0538,0.1246,0.0013,0.7911,1.6135,1.281,2.9059,1.4232,0.2527,4.1712,2.3171,1.4812,1.5826,1.6264,2.5171,3.6882,0.815,0.2494,5.1196,0.0496,0.4231,0.8544,2.6663,0.0059,2.5102,3.3583,4.3223,1.3017,2.1549,1.2973,5.9976,5.2439,2.2342,0.3547,0.4958,1.4555,0.4563,3.3385,2.3276,0.1917,2.4512,3.5952,0.1793,0.3564,0.0021,1.9268,3.9401,3.5061,0.0993,2.0204,0.6695,1.1803,3.9447,2.0989,1.7578,1.5776,1.515,4.0284,1.5329,0.7375,1.4598,1.2322,3.5083,3.8535,0.609,0.2285,1.86,2.6068,3.9366,5.5123,0.0065,5.4501,0.2164,8.7306,1.3893,0.043,0.9343,4.4363,2.4931,0.0005,0.0042,7.5162,1.5793,0.4896,0.8725,0.5347,1.6747,4.8359,1.2785,1.6639,1.607,1.0336,0.0006,0.0075,0.0333,2.2478,0.0046,2.9092,0.5144,1.7389,3.4292,4.882,1.2412,1.5061,6.699,3.379,4.3882,0.0005,0.0031,0.2014,3.5119,1.946,3.839,5.2186,4.8851,0.0422,3.4925,1.8655,4.785,5.1848,3.9615,2.3802,1.4508,0.3546,1.744,3.4018,7.565,2.2849,3.2668,3.8845,5.0472,4.6187,1.2824,4.6412,5.4687,0.262,1.1899,2.4948,0.0016,3.3463,1.7606,2.7123,1.5528,6.1316,7.6796,1.4718,4.354,1.4871,1.6523,10.0482,3.1821,1.1763,2.1145,3.0245,1.3332,0.0835,8.0709,0.7597,0.4416,2.0718,0.5081,0.966,1.0116,0.0006,0.0015,0.0407,7.042,1.8494,7.0219,1.4003,1.0433,5.5942,5.1549,0.0091,3.2811,5.0447,3.712,1.3366,2.0581,4.3422,2.2509,0.4741,0.2218,3.5003,0.0036,0.4997,4.3535,1.591,3.0877,3.9389,5.8101,2.6229,3.3833,0.0043,5.0496,1.606,4.7373,6.4159,3.4132,0.9129,5.3562,0.6233,3.2653,0.147,0.137,1.4589,0.0401,0.344,0.2878,1.515,3.7523,1.5878,0.8148,0.4514,3.3658,0.6976,2.082,5.9312,5.0905,0.6252,7.1306,4.5344,0.4674,1.7276,7.0926,1.9337,1.1581,0.4058,1.13,6.7585,0.4843,1.1763,0.5791,0.4854,4.7933,1.7722,5.0903,1.9995,0.9599,5.0932,1.3817,2.4155,0.438,0.1574,5.1726,4.1967,5.3617,2.5572,4.2374,4.6854,0.5678,3.7257,2.2364,1.0351,0.8135,0.1153,0.1212,0.2919,2.7947,2.4194,3.3339,0.593,5.3657,0.1982,5.708,2.9895,1.223,5.4971,5.8078,5.4682,4.3418,2.4315,1.997,1.4358,2.339,2.0526,0.5329,0.9445,4.2832,3.2862,3.9436,2.8067,5.6821,0.3828,0.9675,3.8671,0.0582,0.2647,0.488,0.2228,4.7101,1.4872,0.7269,0.5309,0.221]}

{"prompt":"The Russian authorities decision to bar opposition leader Alexei Navalny from running in next year s presidential election raises questions about the vote , the European Union s foreign service said in a statement on","text":"The Russian authorities decision to bar opposition leader Alexei Navalny from running in next year s presidential election raises questions about the vote, the European Union s foreign service said in a statement on Thursday. For the moment, the EU is not seeking any kind of sanctions against Russia. The EU foreign service statement comes after the Russian government said on Thursday it was ready to investigate Navalny s health. Health Minister Mikhail Murashko claimed Navalny could have undergone serious nerve damage, making him temporarily paralyzed. Navalny was flown to Moscow s charite hospital shortly after landing on a flight from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning poisoning in August. He remains in severe condition, critically ill. On Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged the European Union to consider imposing more hardline sanctions next month s EU summit. The EU s top diplomat warned that, as Navalny is barred from participating in next year s elections, EU member states will be looking at a broader response. It could be possible, he said, to ban individuals from EU territory that would have a serious impact on how the elections are carried out. But Borrell said that the EU s top officials were currently not thinking about imposing restrictions on flights to Russia. The EU foreign service statement, based on the view of the European Union s health commissioner Ursula Von der Leyen, said that the issue of visa for Navalny s relatives had not been discussed by the EU and it was hoped to find a solution on those issues. Brussels would continue to speak at the appropriate time with the Russian authorities. We welcome the confirmation of the Russian government that Mr Navalny s health is improving, he said. We are very closely following his situation. Navalny posted a lengthy video on Russia s YouTube feed announcing his plans for next year s election campaign. Navalny has repeatedly accused President Vladimir Putin of using poisoned gas to harm him in August for political reasons, but the Kremlin has not produced any evidence to back his claims. Navalny has vowed to continue to fight Putin s government despite the ban. Putin has long pushed for a second term, insisting that he is the architect of the country s economic success and his popularity remains high. The Kremlin, however, denies that Navalny has been poisoned, and the latest attacks against him are seen as an attempt to weaken his potential political opponents. Navalny s plans, however, have angered those who accuse him of trying to capitalise on his injuries. On Thursday, Russia s state news agency was quick to suggest his supporters had been behind another attack on Navalny, a trolley with a blackboard that claimed Navalny had been hacked. In a new Twitter feed that has not been identified by Russia s security service, the Russian media ran a post that accused Navalny of having a blackboard put on the front of his car by loyalists to ensure he could continue to campaign for Putin s reelection at next week s election. There has been speculation in the Western world that Navalny may have been poisoned by the Novichok chemical agent, with Britain, Germany and the United States saying they wanted evidence. Navalny was banned from Russia s election last year by President Vladimir Putin s government he has called it illegal but says he is fighting to regain his rights. And Navalny has repeatedly denied having had anything to do with the Novichok attack.

{"prompt":"If European leaders earned points for the amount of time they spend at summits , French President Emmanuel Macron would probably top the rankings this week . A two-day gathering in Brussels - with talks","text":"If European leaders earned points for the amount of time they spend at summits, French President Emmanuel Macron would probably top the rankings this week. A two-day gathering in Brussels - with talks on a raft of issues - has taken away from his regular schedule in his third week in office.\n\u201cOur country is a nation of summits,\u201d Macron told reporters in Brussels after a summit with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. \"Any country that is going to be strong in Europe must understand this reality.\"\nHe spent Thursday and Friday on the European Council, the formal summit of 27 EU leaders. Macron's agenda was a bit more than a general announcement that countries were moving closer to an exit deal with Britain - he and the leaders also agreed that European policing funds would be boosted and a common army could be conceived.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Macron, the first Franco-European president to take office, spoke in detail about the upcoming decision to create a new European defence force, the creation of which was agreed to by some of the EU's biggest countries and backed by Britain.\nHe also promised to speed up talks on a digital single currency, a project that was postponed several times after a crisis of trust, which was linked to a leaked text written by French officials in the run-up to the European council last year.\nThe president is also determined to push through a new financial deal for Europe, the implementation of which was delayed by the pandemic.\nIn Brussels, he met a range of leaders - among them British King Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nHe had more meetings on his schedule, with the United states President Joe Biden and with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nDuring the last 48 hours, France and Italy - with whom Brussels has always worked closely, which is partly due to the importance of Italy's position as the EU's largest trading partner - have also been critical of the summit.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday expressed disappointment with the meeting, which did not contain a clear statement on a future European defence operation.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t discuss the establishment of a European defence corps that was not set up, or the new defence architecture in the same sense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get the common agreement and we need to take a clear stand in the final weeks of negotiations. \u201d\nMacron also expressed a worry that the agreement could be used against European countries, which many believe is not in the best interests of France.\nThe French president spoke before talks around a new financial deal for Europe. He said these could be considered a bridge project between now and a new generation of EU leaders, but he did not say if the new financial accord should be on the agenda - so far there is an agreement that the next president of the Council - the highest ranking EU official and a member of a national government - will be chosen for 15 months after the next council meeting in September.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron on Thursday insisted that the European Union\u2019s decision to create a new European defence force was not related to Britain.\nMacron was criticised from various sides for taking part in the summit, but he explained that he was still involved in the negotiations that should define the future role of the European Union\u2019s military and the European defence force.","token_len":682,"entropy":[9.5264,2.6669,11.1987,8.141,1.032,2.7119,6.8941,0.2002,2.6842,1.0335,3.8479,3.5776,8.9193,0.0095,0.8157,6.6102,1.5525,1.4655,0.0001,4.9805,3.8147,7.2912,1.0826,4.604,5.4416,1.6952,0.6976,5.2418,6.2248,0.0705,1.8385,5.7529,1.8473,1.6684,7.1719,2.7956,4.8752,1.5976,2.4824,5.4013,0.0014,1.4508,1.2778,2.8485,4.0805,6.3324,1.6825,3.2919,6.1371,3.4425,4.9805,2.9018,6.1042,3.732,0.3742,0.1147,0.6787,0.6916,18.8431,7.5747,10.1372,5.7211,1.438,3.3349,3.1775,0.431,9.4785,0.0074,1.2656,12.2972,8.4009,5.7364,2.0651,1.6351,1.5508,0.9305,3.3097,1.7623,2.5788,2.0651,2.5784,3.577,2.3744,13.3381,0.0016,0.0111,0.0014,0.0001,0.0,0.8312,1.274,6.9916,2.7494,1.2029,2.4403,3.2635,0.1087,2.2491,6.7142,1.1906,2.2658,3.4739,5.9396,3.4283,5.3195,2.6313,0.4872,4.3293,6.8472,5.0802,3.1349,0.1596,3.1916,1.1487,3.4428,1.9357,1.5424,2.9858,6.1857,6.3953,0.9476,4.938,1.1444,2.0425,1.0594,4.7346,2.2038,5.3084,2.4232,3.3538,4.6649,1.3709,4.8794,1.3416,6.7672,6.2016,3.7505,5.8218,2.2126,3.2404,3.4693,0.46,3.7942,4.4621,3.0386,2.1688,3.6413,3.39,2.7595,5.5494,2.3258,3.369,3.9096,2.8059,2.0651,5.3567,10.7836,9.4606,1.5288,0.4799,6.3871,2.9581,3.4136,5.9842,8.7836,4.3195,0.2104,9.2867,0.3685,0.5268,5.6388,1.7531,2.0591,0.3536,4.4998,0.2491,4.1007,3.1548,2.629,9.8491,0.253,5.7177,3.0665,1.3142,2.9891,1.5041,1.7728,3.7419,3.1952,4.265,0.4603,1.0781,5.1501,7.0347,1.3805,6.0519,0.6829,1.7395,1.5723,5.6184,1.5253,1.5832,2.3158,5.3146,0.0053,4.4656,2.3512,4.351,2.4817,1.2373,5.1597,2.0812,0.4705,2.3837,0.3537,3.7628,3.7807,2.4323,7.3979,0.0851,2.4182,0.6199,0.7632,1.8815,1.5175,3.1528,0.7314,6.3703,0.1305,4.7571,0.3887,1.867,8.4108,4.7496,2.4663,1.2621,2.3854,4.0783,1.0802,2.666,5.5504,5.9192,0.3291,2.9694,2.7143,5.2804,3.5515,3.021,4.0596,3.1158,3.1403,4.9921,0.0732,2.2047,6.304,4.6022,5.5173,0.2384,3.0186,3.0356,2.6204,2.6487,1.8174,0.1871,0.0009,0.0033,0.4234,4.2254,3.9544,5.6598,1.2527,0.1541,0.4853,2.1343,3.7779,3.9838,1.9301,5.9296,0.0802,3.701,1.7964,1.0779,2.8164,4.9312,3.6381,2.6957,3.3858,1.443,3.397,7.8489,0.0236,0.1348,2.1151,2.7401,1.9149,1.7746,14.6202,0.0821,6.5945,1.0724,3.534,2.2098,0.3487,1.8615,2.9449,4.3641,4.5049,0.0011,2.6003,2.8574,5.9198,0.0399,4.2569,9.2292,5.4722,4.1651,0.4484,7.0047,0.0011,0.6228,3.1608,4.4915,0.6074,0.0028,8.7129,0.0047,1.2179,1.1926,2.5106,4.2338,5.5157,5.0307,2.6474,3.7864,2.7143,1.7247,2.5427,2.1715,5.6029,9.0423,8.3611,8.6069,0.3811,1.0082,6.0539,2.2121,0.0755,0.0033,0.0014,0.8333,0.8896,4.7808,0.9853,4.7329,7.5148,0.0084,0.4263,3.8746,1.875,2.706,3.5186,3.8158,2.7715,6.8956,1.3163,5.4259,3.4573,1.9476,3.0949,4.0503,2.0268,4.5913,1.632,0.0621,1.1454,4.7383,0.0963,5.1586,1.0073,4.5591,1.499,1.6129,2.5153,0.0881,2.8793,0.6098,0.0211,0.137,1.2149,2.9347,1.7562,5.6594,0.3135,1.0869,4.8394,0.6845,0.5852,3.3283,0.6245,1.1129,0.0021,4.1428,0.9654,5.6584,3.4811,1.6204,0.5873,4.427,1.4297,2.2955,4.6853,0.1418,5.251,1.8027,2.625,4.377,1.151,3.5994,3.4919,3.9535,2.7151,7.1042,0.612,1.8705,3.8202,0.778,3.9617,6.8771,9.9666,11.0776,0.0246,5.49,1.5333,9.0694,0.0628,0.4994,1.9491,1.5311,6.9458,4.5356,3.1247,2.2979,5.5031,0.2254,2.9489,3.2593,1.6125,4.3494,3.8866,5.5937,3.4262,1.9376,5.8679,4.5256,2.5527,2.1944,2.6821,1.6069,0.5858,0.428,6.1135,0.1527,1.3534,3.6288,0.5536,3.5245,2.413,6.0527,6.7972,2.9461,2.7028,0.8209,0.2671,4.1031,2.0867,3.6204,2.8998,3.2076,1.356,6.2672,5.9707,0.9184,3.1271,1.1106,2.9738,5.8009,1.0128,4.8927,0.0006,1.8827,4.1271,3.6228,5.5512,0.971,1.3702,5.7166,2.7289,1.5675,3.8447,2.962,5.0759,1.8248,1.8618,2.3006,5.9245,2.5535,3.3844,4.0713,3.5283,1.0845,1.5009,0.3016,0.0087,2.2363,1.3059,0.3716,2.6094,1.3479,0.7804,4.5621,4.7884,4.8671,7.237,1.2642,1.952,4.1568,0.9918,1.8505,0.545,2.6525,2.0899,1.1552,6.7782,4.1721,1.3309,4.9075,1.9956,7.3725,4.6088,1.7847,7.6473,0.0221,3.0268,1.7671,5.2063,0.1338,1.9044,1.5933,1.4795,3.0042,2.0995,2.4924,0.053,2.057,2.6839,2.0964,1.7546,3.1303,5.7994,3.9177,0.4802,5.6474,0.5867,1.1162,5.4555,6.0506,0.4881,2.8631,1.4733,6.0752,0.8545,3.063,3.0758,4.9761,2.1535,0.9731,0.355,3.9647,4.4104,3.237,5.1609,3.5141,1.9825,0.8682,4.6486,1.9314,1.9861,0.0364,4.4604,6.0249,3.547,0.6839,1.5765,2.0357,4.9512,3.6139,8.7309,1.7186,3.0005,0.7678,2.8679,4.7382,1.0635,2.7195,2.2551,0.2364,0.2314,3.5506,2.8743,0.9997,0.0021,2.0564,0.1735,6.7638,0.6641,1.2423,2.683,2.2609,14.102,4.5099,1.412,4.3616,0.3687,3.2376,0.433,0.4363,1.6728,0.2506,0.0561,0.9765,1.3259,4.9579,0.0048,3.4359,1.8843,0.9237,4.0254,0.0012,3.334,5.7714,5.3414,6.4945,4.9261,0.9689,4.5237,3.1147,0.0852,0.569,1.7237,1.2927,2.457,1.2218,6.7755,0.4802,1.7079,1.3839,4.7437,5.2551,0.5872,1.0062,1.664,4.5098,5.7212,7.0257,0.4751,1.1474,6.4282,0.1476,0.4168,1.0682,0.5439,7.8438,0.2514,0.6322,3.3201,2.2212,3.118,3.1784,1.6864,2.6385,0.2833]}
{"prompt":"Opposition has grown among Americans to a Republican tax plan before the U.S. Congress , with 49 percent of people who were aware of the measure saying they opposed it , up from 41 percent","text":"Opposition has grown among Americans to a Republican tax plan before the U.S. Congress, with 49 percent of people who were aware of the measure saying they opposed it, up from 41 percent in April, according to an internet poll conducted by the Washington Office for Near East Policy. The U.S. Senate also appears to be moving toward a bipartisan tax reform agreement on a similar plan. House leaders are to vote Thursday on a bill to take much of the Senate\u2019s tax reform proposal.\nTreasury and Justice department officials said on Wednesday that they will not seek to enforce provisions of a new tax law that has prompted U.S. businesses to move production out of the United States, reversing a decision taken by the Obama administration earlier this year. The rules, enacted on Monday, are meant to incentivize U.S. production but have been hailed as a threat in the business community, although many lawmakers have said they have backed away from enforcement. The Treasury and Justice departments cited an internal memo and a statement on Tuesday that the administration would not seek to enforce the rules, though they added that \u201call options\u201d were on the table and were ready when needed. No additional details about the internal memos or statements were available on Wednesday. This reversal came as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday called the rules \u201cthe worst tax reform proposal enacted in the history of the free market.\u201d\nWashington has seen only four total wars in modern days, but as many as two or three will come over the next 20 years, according to a study based on a complex set of assumptions by the Brookings Institution. The study, on whether the United States will be able to win several wars using only \u201ctraditional\u201d military force, says that for the sake of conservative estimates, Washington can afford only three wars over a 20-year period. The cost of maintaining all three wars at a time would amount to $435 trillion, the study states. The authors of the study note, however, that while wars are costly, they \u201care the most effective instrument that the U.S. government has in its arsenal to effect structural change.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a small war going on out there somewhere,\u201d said the study\u2019s author, Nicholas Thomas, a Brookings senior fellow. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a major international conflict.\u201d\nThe study \u2014 titled \u201cHow Many Wars Can the United States Win?\u201d and published Monday \u2014 took into account the potential effect of increased U.S. spending on arms, as well as the effects of U.S. military strength on global political and economic stability, the costs of military campaigns outside the United States and the effects of a weakening U.S. economy on military readiness. The study, however, did not take into account the possibility of nuclear war and does not consider the possibility of the United States losing, which could occur with any military defeat. According to the study, a military campaign in Iraq that involved the U.S. taking over from the U.K. and aiding the Kurdish population in the north would cost about $100 trillion. The cost would be $80 trillion in Somalia, $13 trillion in Afghanistan, $11 trillion in Pakistan, $9 trillion in Iraq and $7 trillion in the Gulf.","token_len":683,"entropy":[8.3479,5.068,6.1408,5.2096,7.8857,2.2685,3.6931,8.343,7.6389,0.6704,6.6994,1.2371,4.0114,0.0008,0.0024,0.0073,3.4391,2.0121,2.3586,6.8427,0.5745,1.4238,4.4751,3.6039,4.9865,5.9516,0.2266,0.4997,3.9061,1.1421,0.7306,3.6861,0.2325,1.6482,2.9864,0.1606,3.1459,0.0038,0.8058,3.3448,2.2017,0.3326,0.0007,3.2394,9.573,0.9488,1.3648,0.6699,2.0463,3.5235,8.7556,5.8469,9.5341,1.5023,0.1411,0.4459,2.8798,4.0405,0.0012,0.0338,0.0266,2.4227,4.2101,4.979,0.5968,0.4884,2.7153,1.9625,0.6677,4.882,1.4485,2.4264,5.5809,3.6759,3.5277,4.9083,4.7271,1.2669,6.8964,3.6636,1.7262,6.0563,1.8085,3.8854,0.1023,0.6787,1.7523,1.1326,5.3354,7.2025,0.4458,0.2303,4.8674,15.2873,9.0651,2.8168,1.2089,2.438,4.1578,4.5395,0.9581,22.4773,0.0047,5.9405,5.6203,4.9019,0.2238,1.6885,2.9903,1.7339,0.4188,1.1845,2.3587,2.1564,3.319,1.3825,6.0792,5.2151,0.2909,3.2423,4.1213,1.4562,1.3817,1.0413,3.6302,5.6441,5.8223,0.0004,0.0023,0.0034,3.4806,0.2215,4.1153,4.9599,3.1259,0.0087,0.9687,1.5692,0.0297,1.7946,6.6369,1.048,2.7093,4.0843,1.3189,1.235,1.1285,0.0294,2.1298,0.0679,0.345,1.0433,2.0772,6.5416,2.4047,4.2963,3.6777,4.7753,0.2748,2.8394,2.4173,0.0256,6.3266,0.0025,2.8801,0.0002,0.0019,0.0207,5.0166,5.7143,2.4254,1.6646,6.7004,0.6909,0.6284,7.6211,5.1512,1.7052,4.0025,0.4752,2.3288,5.4645,3.0252,4.7978,1.7794,1.9506,0.6839,2.9837,6.0823,2.1788,0.0786,6.5822,0.8627,2.5232,2.3913,2.9165,0.1121,0.4186,6.1773,3.6378,4.1913,1.1438,5.3607,1.7819,4.9668,3.673,2.0163,1.5487,2.7099,2.9133,2.8122,0.9355,1.7544,0.3357,0.7891,0.8927,1.2129,1.8436,3.06,1.5972,4.365,0.3944,14.6734,7.1254,5.4708,4.5198,4.9357,6.1814,1.5474,0.4279,0.091,0.0026,3.4286,3.9899,4.9574,6.0517,4.9235,0.1254,6.5303,5.1785,1.8088,2.3536,0.634,6.3254,3.5093,1.3392,1.1458,0.5685,1.7376,2.8554,0.1975,0.2135,7.0647,7.0946,2.8223,1.6106,3.2896,0.0003,0.0029,0.0028,3.1896,0.1973,1.115,0.0004,6.1254,1.4752,3.696,2.0895,4.6584,10.2025,0.8746,3.5776,3.3448,3.3822,1.3082,2.7737,6.5168,0.691,1.647,1.0588,0.0054,0.2947,7.4238,1.5891,3.7901,6.6603,5.8203,1.6431,4.9489,2.9043,3.5448,6.8317,4.2539,7.2165,5.8225,1.0935,4.0876,7.9468,0.9124,2.691,5.1256,4.1587,0.0409,3.7548,3.8435,0.1033,5.1391,3.7671,4.7233,0.0999,0.1075,3.1923,0.0527,1.0791,1.8189,0.0023,1.6153,2.9218,6.1955,0.0182,2.8648,9.1341,2.428,0.0011,3.1917,2.6268,1.4149,3.1429,0.0443,1.0434,1.5318,2.6967,2.0095,6.4287,5.6241,1.379,2.1895,0.0066,1.6422,2.3405,0.6274,0.0196,4.9778,6.2885,0.4532,5.573,4.4655,13.4949,0.5388,5.1594,6.8078,2.8881,2.5113,1.9564,0.3873,4.3429,1.0887,4.9287,1.1817,6.2345,0.0014,8.3318,2.7259,0.2858,3.8543,3.2715,3.5878,3.0332,2.5055,0.6406,2.6149,3.1825,2.6952,0.0735,0.0366,0.1264,0.665,2.0548,4.9363,0.5648,4.2287,5.2949,1.4102,0.5694,5.5293,2.5021,1.8923,1.9794,4.1029,0.0168,1.2966,8.0983,4.1104,1.2533,2.2075,0.7086,3.8014,0.3713,2.2547,5.0983,1.781,0.1253,0.5381,4.5152,3.8053,0.1074,0.0027,0.0249,4.2269,4.4831,1.8203,2.4907,0.6914,0.8652,7.3992,0.2725,3.437,4.7008,2.1415,2.4041,8.0652,3.6581,3.3169,1.4328,0.0004,0.0019,0.0024,2.2178,1.9268,1.9991,3.4086,0.6713,1.8368,6.8448,7.8912,0.9136,0.982,4.8722,1.0695,0.4006,4.2823,1.6288,5.9365,5.0812,8.0902,3.873,2.0713,3.2354,0.2344,1.8415,5.25,2.1531,6.4988,1.7522,6.1265,0.9964,5.6296,1.5591,3.2421,2.2759,3.5161,2.8367,1.0452,2.9912,4.4964,0.1667,2.9632,0.3545,5.8163,7.646,0.7854,0.9183,4.5367,4.2037,0.1237,0.7707,4.2583,0.761,0.9651,1.6057,0.8799,0.083,0.5146,0.1082,0.7558,4.2489,5.3143,1.247,2.551,0.6919,0.6024,0.52,2.0164,1.6792,7.0247,4.3636,3.0508,0.4925,3.8406,4.923,0.4287,3.0215,3.0134,0.5907,0.0042,1.2568,2.0071,0.4632,1.0373,2.9715,2.5121,4.1177,2.9003,5.7327,1.1926,0.0437,1.5386,3.9027,4.6762,0.5657,6.2718,1.4174,0.0005,0.0016,0.0394,4.1771,0.3043,5.0487,1.3577,3.9054,0.0287,0.0175,1.2195,4.0199,0.1867,4.5874,0.0004,0.0041,0.2253,2.1631,5.0032,0.731,3.2002,4.8676,1.4969,0.4783,2.7032,1.5116,2.9707,6.309,0.2205,3.1643,4.9856,7.3376,0.4984,0.6945,0.006,1.178,1.0728,3.2238,0.1698,3.5013,5.665,3.5786,0.0002,0.0025,0.0167,1.0789,0.8019,5.3134,3.0974,0.4477,1.5553,1.0759,3.222,4.4939,0.0018,2.1093,0.0637,2.6781,0.0676,0.0456,0.966,3.2937,1.0994,6.7556,0.9497,3.2323,6.7932,0.0293,1.8009,0.9376,1.8409,0.3874,3.3568,1.8623,0.0108,2.0709,6.6844,3.9681,1.7107,4.767,3.5369,4.1914,3.511,6.2929,0.6942,5.5013,0.0027,0.953,0.653,0.1618,3.4079,3.7476,4.7876,2.1586,2.7113,3.9539,4.6864,1.9191,2.1215,0.0007,0.0019,0.1448,3.6361,2.8514,4.528,2.2259,3.2402,0.0009,3.3803,0.2186,2.4294,9.0055,1.2353,3.383,5.1395,1.5847,1.7538,3.2322,1.4,2.551,3.1671,0.0489,3.6335,3.9804,1.673,1.7644,2.1112,2.1853,0.9096,2.3301,5.446,1.133,2.7098,11.8962,0.7422,0.4845,5.2288,0.1267,0.0637,1.534,0.5683,0.5064,3.0145,0.0368,0.0383,1.9019,0.518,0.4968,2.2203,0.0634,0.0448,1.1012,0.9042,0.1698,2.3447,0.0267,0.0796,2.6478,3.0026,1.5661]}
{"prompt":"A group of Myanmar journalists said they would begin wearing black T-shirts on Saturday in protest at the detention of two Reuters reporters accused of violating the country s Official Secrets Act , as pressure","text":"A group of Myanmar journalists said they would begin wearing black T-shirts on Saturday in protest at the detention of two Reuters reporters accused of violating the country s Official Secrets Act, as pressure from foreign governments builds to secure their release.\nThe activists, who are affiliated with the Red Shirt Coalition, said they will join their colleagues in calling for the release of two Reuters reporters who were accused of trying to enter Myanmar from Thailand without permission on Oct. 21 while they were filming with an independent television report.\nReuters journalists Min Htay Aung and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were arrested Friday and charged with attempting to smuggle foreign weapons and intelligence via Myanmar into Thailand, violating an Official Secrets Act, and espionage, authorities said.\nThey were ordered to be detained until next Monday but their lawyers said there would be more arrests soon and that there will be no trial. The military government maintains media is subject to its control.\nReuters reported from Rangoon this month that the military detained at least 50 members of the Red Shirt organization, which has been at the forefront of the pro-democracy protests over an annual constitutional bill.\nAuthorities say the group is trying to undermine the military s election and rule, and that members are planning terrorist attacks and carrying out bombings.\nThe country has been grappling with political unrest since the military seized power earlier this year in a coup that has killed more than 3,000 protesters and brought dismay to the world s largest democracy - a nation which had not seen a coup d \u00e9tat since the end of colonial rule in 1948.\nThousands of people have rallied daily for weeks to call for the release of political detainees, military rule to end and democracy to return.\nLast week, the military s security forces shot dead a Reuters photographer in a crackdown on protest leaders and supporters, and five journalists have reported missing.\nThe United States, the European Union and several other nations have urged the military to release the two Reuters journalists, and several foreign countries have offered to travel to Myanmar to press for their freedom.\nReuters said it could not immediately confirm whether the two journalists have been held together with others who were charged with the same offence. Reuters has been on the ground in Myanmar reporting the protest movement since the end of January.\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Friday that the US has issued a statement for the release of the two Reuters journalists. He urged the regime to make a decision, saying he wanted to find a solution to the crisis that was \"quick and dignified.\"\nBlinken said the US government is looking into the two reporters s case, and said the United States supports the international community in urging the authorities to allow the journalists to resume their work. \"We continue to encourage a swift and dignified release,\" he said.\nMyanmar media watchdog Myanmar Watch said on Friday it had urged the media to report fairly on the conflict, and asked that \"the rights for the rights of journalists and media workers may be respected.\"\nDemolition of a statue of Aung San Suu Kyi over the weekend by activists who protest the junta s takeover of the government raised new questions over Myanmar s media and human rights

The disaster relief bill that had $260 million earmarked for Hurricane Harvey would leave the states with $190 million to help Texas residents still struggling from the storm \u2013 far short of the $1 billion requested for the event by the congressmen\u2019s group.\nThe states of Louisiana and Mississippi and the affected city of Houston are requesting $1.25 billion for recovery. In the meantime, more than $300 million in emergency relief funds have already been approved while $40 million to $60 million is set aside for the states.\nCongress was quick to pass a disaster relief bill after Hurricane Irma caused damages in Florida on last September. Florida is among the worst affected by Hurricane Irma as it had two deaths and significant flood damage to homes, buildings and roads. The state was among several states damaged by Hurricane Harvey.\nPrevious post The new $260 million H.R. 4233 flood recovery bill will continue to provide $250 million in Emergency Assistance\nNewly refurbished, this three bedroom holiday home is located within a 10-minute walk from a beach, shop\/gas station and pub. With plenty of space and a large decked entertaining area, this property is ideal for all family members or couples.\nI had the pleasure of photographing this sweet baby before her wedding and just a few weeks after. It was so much fun to photograph their adorable little family. And boy do they grow up every year! This year I also have the privilege of capturing the birth of their sister. Such a blessing. xo\nIt\u2019s that time of year again! The holiday season is one I love. I\u2019m fortunate to be surrounded by the most generous people in the WIC program and our family. The love that they share and their passion for helping make life better for others is palpable, and you can see it in the ways they choose to give.\nI think a lot about the gifts I\u2019ve received this year from both family and friends. Some of the larger gifts have been financial, others less tangible such as visits, hugs, stories, pictures, and even gift cards.\nI also love to look back on the gifts you all have given me since I graduated from college.

{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said there was deep concern about allegations of sexual misconduct against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore and that he was looking options to prevent him from taking office .","text":"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said there was deep concern about allegations of sexual misconduct against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore and that he was looking options to prevent him from taking office. \u201cIn the wake of allegations against a Senate candidate in Alabama, I\u2019m considering steps to help ensure an appropriate investigation and process in order to ensure fairness,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cThis year, I don\u2019t want voters to mistake another man\u2019s bad habits for a man\u2019s character, and to turn out to vote someone else for political power.\u201d The statement was the latest in a growing debate around allegations of sexual misconduct against politicians across the country. McConnell\u2019s remarks came as Moore publicly acknowledged that he has had sexual intercourse with women, after telling colleagues at a private meeting that he was married when he was not. Moore, a retired Supreme Court justice and a former Congressman from Georgia, has denied allegations that he groped a woman who said he met in 1982, and that he made inappropriate comments about her breasts. His candidacy was derailed after he admitted to a young woman that he had lied when she said he told her he wanted to have sex with her in a phone conversation last year. In another accusation, a woman told a reporter\u2019s campaign that she had been threatened by Moore in 2014 and that he made jokes about her breasts. McConnell said that he wants an \u201cindependent special counsel and process\u201d to help to ensure fairness in the investigation of sexual misconduct allegations, which he termed a \u201cgreat concern of mine.\u201d The statement said there was no suggestion that he would be supporting Moore\u2019s election. \u201cThere is no suggestion that I am endorsing Roy Moore\u2019s nomination and in fact no announcement of that endorsement is forthcoming,\u201d the statement said. McConnell added that he did not know the identity of the woman who accused Moore of sexual misconduct. He said Moore was still a senator from the state of Alabama in his own right. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican in the Senate, said Moore \u201cis one of that body\u2019s most distinguished former presidents.\u201d She said she would continue her support of Moore and that she believed he was running as an independent candidate. Earlier this month, three women told CNN they had been sexually molested by Moore when they were 16 or 17 years-old. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that he \u201cnever wanted to see Moore anywhere near the Senate office.\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Wednesday that House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump will meet Monday morning to discuss potential Republican candidates for the vice presidency. The president\u2019s office said in a statement that Trump \u201casked for a meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Monday morning to discuss the selection of a vice president\u201d.\nThe president\u2019s office said in a statement that Trump \u201casked for a meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Monday morning to discuss the selection

Republican officials in the House of Representatives are less skeptical about a change to NAFTA.\nWith the change in control of the White House and Congress, the future of NAFTA seems uncertain.\nTrump plans to announce the policy changes on Friday as part of a broader U.S. trade strategy aimed at making the economy more competitive. As part of the president\u2019s economic campaign promise, the administration wants to stop the expansion of China\u2019s influence over North American trade deals.\nTrump, who has questioned the necessity of NAFTA, has said he is prepared to renegotiate the agreement, something the administration officials said on Thursday was not a matter of great urgency.\nThe vice president met Wednesday with a small group of governors to discuss plans to revise the agreement. That meeting included Republican governors from Texas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas and Kansas.\nThe Republican-led governors called the proposals to modify NAFTA \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201cshould be explored,\u201d a White House official said Wednesday.\n\u201cGovernors were told the U.S. is committed to making NAFTA better,\u201d the official, who requested anonymity, said, referring to the three-phase trade deal that has been in force for more than 20 years, and is the cornerstone of U.S. foreign economic policy.\nHowever, he added, \u201cthe idea they were considering was a change in the current status quo. And that\u2019s not what\u2019s on the table.\u201d\nTrump said he hoped to get Republican senators to support the changes, the official added, \u201cbut even if he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201d\nThe administration and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are weighing whether to give the vice president, Pence \u2014 instead of Trump \u2014 final say on NAFTA changes.\nWhite House officials also said last week that Trump wasn\u2019t considering changing NAFTA before the elections, and would let Pence decide on the issue after the November

{"prompt":"A suicide bomber disguised as a policeman blew himself up inside a police training camp in Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Thursday and killed at least 18 officers , officials said . Police spokesman Major","text":"A suicide bomber disguised as a policeman blew himself up inside a police training camp in Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Thursday and killed at least 18 officers, officials said. Police spokesman Major Ahmed Dahir Sheikh said at least 18 officers died in the attack along two roads leading into government buildings. The blast took place outside police headquarters at the main Somali police academy, with the blast site only about 100 meters (328 feet) from the police ministry. Sheikh said there were more than 100 people in police training facilities at the time of the blast. Police said the bomber blew himself up, but the motive of the attack was not immediately known, Somali police said. A US Central Command spokesman said US and Somalian police had not been given any information linking the terrorist attack to US or other foreign missions. The US ambassador to Somalia said a man dressed as a police officer did not appear in photographs he saw of the suspected suicide bomber s entry into its compound. Somal-US relations had suffered in recent months after a US drone strike killed the brother of Somalia s president. A US drone strike killed al-Shabab leader and military commander Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke in July. UN chief Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and said he wanted to support the Somali authorities in tracking down the suspects behind the attack. Somalia is racked by years of war and conflict, as well as famine, and has long faced terrorist activity perpetrated by al-Shabaab, which began as a student group that took up arms against the central government in 2007. It has taken up arms again since a US drone strike killed one of its strongman leaders last year. It is fighting a deadly conflict with neighboring countries in Somalia and also in Yemen, its campaign to overthrow the government of Yemen being one of the most prominent aspects of the ongoing crisis in that country. Somalia s Prime Minister Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled the country last week when al-Shabaab began attacking government forces. The UN security council last month decided to impose a no-fly zone over parts of Somalia and Djibouti, a move which analysts said helped to reduce some of the violence in the region. The attack came a few days after at least 28 people were killed in an assault on a village in the north of Somalia. Somalia s president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed urged the Somalian people not to lose hope, saying the country was moving toward peace, stability and national reconciliation. This story was corrected by the Associated Press to reflect that the U.S. ambassador said there was no indication that the attacker was a person working under U.S. auspices or on behalf of foreign powers. This story also used the wrong name for the Somalia National Police Academy (SNPA), which is known as the Somalia police training academy.

Chombo , a senior","text":"A Zimbabwean judge freed ousted finance minister Ignatius Chombo on bail on Thursday in a ruling that underlined judicial independence just three weeks after the army helped depose Robert Mugabe. Chombo, a senior official who helped finance one of Africa\u2019s most expensive campaigns, got out of prison on a huge bail of US$4 million paid by an industrialist. Chombo is still serving 10 of 20 years of a 20-year sentence for corruption. His lawyers said the charges against the man who served as Zimbabwe\u2019s finance minister during the final months of President Robert Mugabe\u2019s rule would have been frivolous if he was still in prison. Zimbabwe\u2019s judiciary has often been criticised for its bias against the opposition. In April the court ruled against the presidential candidacy of opposition leader Tendai Biti, saying he lacked the appropriate education. Chombo will remain free while a judge hears a ruling against him in the corruption charges, and then can be released if it falls out in favour of the minister.. Zimbabweans remain divided about Zimbabwe\u2019s path after the military ended Robert Mugabe \u2019s 29-year rule, as millions of granny shops continue to empty shelves and some take to the streets to vent their frustration with a power vacuum. Many believe that without international intervention, Mugabe will continue to be in power as a dictator for years to come.\nSUNNYVALE \u2014 Two weeks after losing his job, John Murphy felt like the end of the world.

He served in two terms in the United States Senate as a Democrat from 1975-1991 and as a Republican from 1991-1997.\nThe last time President Carter was elected, he won the presidential election with 48.77% of the vote.\nPresident Bush is a former US president whose two terms in office ran from January 2001 to January 2009.\nPresident Bush was born into a prominent family in Dallas, Texas.

There is still much debate about the size of China\u2019s conventional military, but the PRC clearly does have one. China is also far better at cyber warfare and information warfare than the U.S. has been, and has a far greater economic stake in maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait.\nFor decades, the U.S. has underestimated Chinese military capabilities, making the mistake of trying to engage China by imposing a no-fly zone over Taiwan. In the past few years, the Taiwanese military has made some improvement, particularly in the area of cyber warfare. China\u2019s foreign policy has also changed since the Cold War, and it is more inclined to use force on foreign shores. But Beijing has not yet given up the idea of trying to \u201cwin over\u201d Taiwan and achieve separation by force, and that is a concern for the U.S.. But Beijing isn\u2019t giving up its dream of one China. This is no different from any other attempt to break up a country by foreign powers, and there are several ways the two countries might engage.\nOne of the most recent threats from the Chinese military was a warning that it would \u201cuse force to guarantee\u201d Taiwan independence. Such a warning is unprecedented and dangerous. China has used military force in the past to guarantee compliance with its policies \u2014 in 1989, when the communists invaded the country, the military forcibly moved a large chunk of the population across the Taiwan Strait to Hong Kong. In 1990, the military forced Tibetans to cross the border from China, and the Chinese government gave Beijing its blessing in exchange for a political settlement. In 1995, the military forced Taiwan people to surrender to a unified government.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has already spoken at length about the need to win over Taiwan and has said that it would cost the Taiwanese economy $1 trillion to maintain the island\u2019s current defense spending and infrastructure. In February, Xi said China needs \u201cone China\u201d to be an Asian superpower and China would not support Taiwan for one day. Xi said, \u201cAny move to split up Taiwan will be categorically rejected by the Chinese people, and China will have no choice but to defend Taiwan and the Mainland united by force.\u201d\nThis all means that Beijing has no intention of letting Taiwan stay independent. The PRC has the resources and military capability to take control of Taiwan with a single strike and has been training the military to use a cyber attack to take control of the island. And the Chinese government has openly threatened the international community to let the PRC\u2019s military target U.S. ships on the Taiwan Strait. But China hasn\u2019t sent troops across the Taiwan Strait because of internal disagreements about whether to wage war and the U.S. isn\u2019t worried about provoking China militarily, but it\u2019s doing some other thing to try to create an unfriendly environment for the PRC.","token_len":687,"entropy":[9.608,5.2185,2.6423,5.0367,4.9567,1.8058,1.0403,6.6964,2.2023,7.3286,7.7441,7.9022,3.5571,0.0123,0.0266,0.0407,6.3014,0.0303,6.8075,1.5385,8.9382,0.0338,2.7378,0.0068,0.5052,3.0703,6.0379,1.6938,5.572,0.5565,0.0162,3.4833,1.2389,4.77,0.0056,3.6207,0.8536,0.0782,5.5432,0.0514,4.7721,2.8522,6.9114,2.0403,4.9688,10.1118,0.1629,0.1058,2.4098,0.9996,6.5557,0.4538,0.1394,0.4208,20.3146,1.6864,4.3968,5.5766,1.811,2.2416,1.3236,2.6985,5.9383,3.1072,8.0197,0.0229,1.4204,3.6523,6.3088,1.2806,0.4635,3.9728,1.2752,3.5053,0.0873,1.8266,9.3776,0.5323,1.7064,4.1932,3.8551,0.7616,2.1854,2.0324,4.3046,0.5971,4.4014,2.3344,2.3814,5.5717,0.8862,4.9405,2.572,3.8849,1.081,2.0749,4.5192,0.1499,1.0734,16.34,7.5579,5.9909,7.0675,1.0149,1.7815,1.1887,2.0278,2.4046,0.0026,7.1865,3.8486,1.4271,5.3933,2.7101,3.3946,1.8569,2.7365,5.5532,3.5506,1.1637,4.9091,1.625,2.7367,4.4444,0.9876,0.6328,1.474,0.8969,0.0005,0.0024,0.8558,3.0938,0.4214,1.5754,0.9595,2.8931,2.3133,4.0126,1.5554,4.9919,4.5822,0.286,3.1446,3.4179,0.6986,0.4968,5.5924,0.09,0.7769,0.6393,4.7332,3.2758,0.365,1.6915,1.7241,0.0004,0.0019,0.153,0.758,7.7313,3.9695,1.6042,1.4689,1.2185,5.436,2.7439,7.9155,0.0639,3.8621,0.0178,5.4106,3.67,4.4657,6.6365,1.8696,5.3235,0.0695,0.1981,0.0212,1.1929,0.8477,0.8966,2.9403,1.8116,2.3898,2.3936,0.3906,0.069,1.6521,5.2025,2.3907,0.2834,4.4329,3.3189,7.4544,0.8789,4.5295,0.7629,1.6403,3.4354,0.0188,1.6147,1.091,0.9155,3.1104,12.9989,0.3698,0.0067,5.975,1.9755,1.0271,2.8478,2.6238,3.7745,0.8082,3.0173,0.0012,0.6714,1.2886,2.2131,1.1727,4.0776,5.9169,0.2024,3.6121,1.3934,3.8186,5.824,7.4888,1.5893,3.3583,3.5208,1.3484,2.7188,3.0347,4.9104,0.3087,2.821,1.9438,0.4314,4.2549,0.0395,15.9136,5.4094,6.2568,5.5599,7.6441,7.4488,1.3829,3.3538,8.0692,10.4324,4.9204,0.9193,1.7651,0.842,2.9135,1.4279,2.0485,5.633,1.019,1.6878,1.748,0.0007,0.0009,7.0293,4.5669,3.695,6.0131,3.1866,3.7087,0.0153,4.3896,0.0096,1.8985,5.0797,0.2918,5.6251,2.3125,1.3586,4.8654,1.0303,4.6978,4.299,0.825,3.6448,0.5529,5.723,0.5355,2.9081,1.2255,1.4483,3.2687,2.7707,7.4399,3.2246,1.5061,1.7298,3.5526,1.1515,3.9656,2.2694,2.4218,4.3485,1.7326,3.2798,4.866,1.6417,0.871,3.49,2.6879,0.3087,1.0826,4.6125,6.4124,3.2819,1.6555,2.0646,3.6814,1.7145,2.2347,5.3633,2.7174,3.4358,1.2015,11.3444,0.349,5.694,0.6736,3.1267,8.4199,7.7809,1.1089,3.099,3.9773,1.0445,5.0519,0.6265,2.7538,2.4602,5.8264,2.7261,6.0385,1.1789,2.5396,1.3497,4.2726,2.8542,0.1731,1.587,1.1806,0.1868,1.2376,6.615,9.0287,0.115,2.9644,6.7423,5.9751,3.3001,4.6116,0.4314,2.8494,1.7359,5.5473,2.6232,2.1127,2.691,0.5667,1.8332,3.88,6.8474,4.057,2.8733,3.2142,4.8409,0.0033,1.0491,1.9318,5.1384,0.3314,2.4799,0.0218,1.3815,5.9688,0.017,1.0699,2.1227,4.6408,0.0758,1.2825,2.6001,4.9337,7.2716,0.4836,0.5919,3.6561,0.5887,1.5515,3.3579,0.9665,2.3179,1.4774,2.3975,1.8227,0.944,5.5623,4.9872,5.0641,2.8,3.3745,4.0259,0.3668,2.5889,4.9669,0.2842,0.5489,1.9534,3.3375,0.0483,0.9736,2.1206,3.8385,3.0973,8.0027,0.2944,4.7356,1.4239,3.4185,6.9917,1.6081,1.4049,1.8887,4.6424,3.7808,0.3074,0.0507,1.7955,4.2883,4.2353,4.5307,0.616,0.1548,1.0821,0.9513,0.633,6.663,0.7143,0.9695,2.2691,4.3103,3.0083,0.4604,3.0107,1.6687,6.9323,1.8411,5.2364,1.1683,2.414,1.9342,0.703,1.5599,2.6874,2.241,3.1199,3.6317,0.412,0.0617,5.569,6.0076,4.5134,3.2183,5.0969,0.3072,2.836,4.5884,0.4147,2.2573,1.7295,4.0468,5.9926,7.5814,0.0642,5.5758,1.114,0.3087,7.2645,1.9168,4.2685,4.4894,4.9487,1.4143,2.7062,4.589,2.8739,1.7554,5.1294,4.242,4.5394,5.3436,1.2303,0.3903,4.1957,2.8558,3.3937,3.7963,0.3982,7.7993,4.1374,1.137,4.5416,2.7517,1.5895,2.8802,2.1876,9.6895,0.006,2.1185,0.8876,0.9638,1.4773,3.0149,2.1803,0.7428,2.6774,0.8817,3.5787,1.3077,0.4534,0.0778,0.007,3.1607,1.641,3.0409,2.5803,10.6531,0.0011,11.8537,1.6785,3.0183,0.4349,5.0516,4.3277,0.6385,3.3447,6.4128,4.2902,0.3147,2.9698,1.8997,2.5397,2.5004,0.042,4.7411,0.7227,5.0984,2.6516,0.9448,2.1083,2.4249,0.0023,1.6337,3.3135,4.6097,1.2159,3.478,2.5731,0.184,3.4135,2.9019,0.2182,0.9323,4.4947,2.6715,2.2598,2.0278,2.5386,4.0562,3.1805,5.7126,2.7307,2.6884,1.0702,3.121,4.1241,3.8558,2.3668,1.2785,2.981,2.0464,0.2335,0.9908,0.9904,0.5673,3.8369,2.138,2.6069,1.7554,0.9198,6.6441,4.0699,2.7633,7.0816,0.0187,3.3458,6.0757,1.5388,1.0067,0.0018,10.5993,0.207,0.0203,1.6529,7.6219,4.1819,0.0007,0.0014,0.0481,3.04,4.5303,1.2176,2.1048,0.0726,1.0434,3.0524,2.5742,3.7269,1.0746,0.4651,0.0129,5.6567,2.7482,5.5879,0.1284,1.379,0.036,4.3052,1.6214,6.6413,2.9675,2.7628,2.497,0.8113,7.3668,1.0021,3.8915,3.6821,3.6436,0.0008,0.0015,0.1207,4.4628,0.3715,0.0608,0.0019,3.9317,0.3525,5.0475,2.2025,4.6221,0.0003,2.8221,3.1478,2.5351,4.9656,0.0357,0.0479,4.1707,5.0152,5.0389,3.5409,1.0576,3.3553,0.3061,5.4006,2.8032,6.9879,0.1063,0.0241,1.6072,0.7152,1.441,0.5773,0.0019,1.2331]}
{"prompt":"A sacked Turkish professor who has been on hunger strike for almost nine months and is barely half her original weight said on Wednesday she had appealed a court ruling that linked her to a","text":"A sacked Turkish professor who has been on hunger strike for almost nine months and is barely half her original weight said on Wednesday she had appealed a court ruling that linked her to a Turkish intelligence agency.\nAtana B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f, who was dismissed from her post last year for speaking out on behalf of Kurdish political prisoners and their families after years of working in Istanbul, is an activist who said she met with the government in 2010 via the Kurdish Information Directorate.\nShe has been under house arrest since then on the suspicion that she was one such informant.\nOn Wednesday, a provincial judge in the southeastern province of Mersin ruled that B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f was a traitor for meeting with the Directorate, saying the appointment of a foreign body as a teacher was prohibited by law even if such a job involved working for the public. She has been placed under house arrest, she said.\nLast week, a Mersin court ruled that she was guilty of \"spreading propaganda against the state\" and sentenced her to a year in prison, one month suspended. The punishment sparked protests in Turkey's Kurdish-majority areas from people who said B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f had been a freedom fighter.\nIn a statement, B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f said that \"without any doubt I had no connection with the state secret services, but that did not mean I should be considered a traitor. I did not spread propaganda against the state, and I had never been arrested before. I was not a fugitive in search of asylum. I was sacked without any reason in Turkey and imprisoned for one year.\"\nIn a letter in the Turkish media that went viral, B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f said her hunger strike was the result of her own treatment from doctors and that she was a victim of \"social cleansing.\"\nOn Wednesday, B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f was only 57 per cent of her original weight and said she had lost 20 per cent of her blood volume.\n\"Since being sacked, I haven't stopped being in trouble... I have not asked for forgiveness, but I hope my trial will bring justice for me,\" B\u00fcy\u00fckta\u015f told reporters. \"They said my blood volume was not enough. They said my lungs and heart were broken. They accused me of a crime for which I was not criminally charged.\"\nShe said that despite the lack of contact with her legal team, she felt she would be wronged by the court ruling. \"I don't regret any of my decisions and actions. No, I don't blame them who are trying to kill me. I always said the state knew the truth. I don't care how I am going to die. I would like to die when innocent people are being killed by the state. I will not go away from the crime of informing the people.

It is a lie that we\u2019ve already heard 100 times, \u201d Mattis said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Asked about the media report that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis slammed Wednesday as \u201cfake news,\u201d President Trump made the comment on Twitter Tuesday morning. It was Mattis and the Pentagon that were accused by the National Press Club last month of misleading a Senate committee on \u201calternative facts.\u201d \u201cThe National Press Club says \u2018alternative fact\u2019 has become a weaponized buzzword used to intimidate and intimidate people who are critical of President Donald Trump and the U.S. government, \u201d the Post quoted the report as saying. The New York Times reported last month that Trump has frequently mocked intelligence officials for their assessments of his re-election and described intelligence briefings as \u201cfake news.\u201d On \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Trump said that he had never made a statement comparing what the intelligence agencies say is good, bad, and ugly with what he believes. \u201cJust saying something you don\u2019t believe in is not lying. That\u2019s a statement \u2014 something you disagree with is not lying,\u201d Trump said. Meanwhile, Sen.

Lindsey Graham called the Post report a \u201cdisparaging and wrong-headed portrayal of the intelligence agencies\u2019 work.\u201d Graham on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He also said that intelligence is critical to protecting America and that his opposition to the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions does not constitute an effort to weaken them. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an absolutely phenomenal job. \u2026 I think they\u2019re doing a marvelous job, and I think that the intelligence community itself is doing a terrific job. I also do not think their conclusions were anything other than scientific,\u201d Graham said. Source: AFP via Yahoo News\nJPMorgan Chase says it will continue to report \u201ccore\u201d results for its U.S. unit if it is part of a deal to merge with another bank. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a little better news on both sides if it happens,\u201d Timothy Grady, senior VP of communications at the global banking unit of JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview Thursday afternoon. If the merger of two American banks goes through, JPMorgan, the largest bank by assets, would become the biggest U.S. bank with a market value of about $900 billion, Bloomberg reported. The announcement of a deal between JPMorgan and another U.S. bank would come within a day of the conclusion of a deal, which was expected to be announced today. A spokesperson for the bank on Thursday would not provide a timeline on a deal. The announcement on Thursday comes a day after JPMorgan reported its results to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, and a little later than expected. The JPMorgan reported core earnings per share of 4 cents, below the consensus estimate of 4 1\/2 cents, despite revenue that was better than expected.

{"prompt":"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump s unfortunate decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was trampling on international laws . Erdogan speaking in Athens after talks","text":"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump s unfortunate decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was trampling on international laws. Erdogan speaking in Athens after talks with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulu described Trump s move as a \u201ccrass step\u201d. Erdogan added \u201cAs long as such acts are committed, no country in the world should support it.\u201d Erdogan also criticized Trump s decision on Thursday saying that it is a violation of international law and will not be recognized by many countries around the world. Speaking about Syria, Erdogan said he was disappointed that Trump had not accepted the proposed deal on Syria offered by Russian leaders on Thursday. \u201cWhy is it that the Americans do not want to listen to the Russians or the Syrians,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWe want to solve the crisis in Syria by peaceful methods so that no country gets the upper hand in this conflict.\u201d He added \u201cWe can solve the problem by dialogue but if the American President takes the opposite route that would be an unpleasant surprise \u201c. Trump announced his decision to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem last month and pledged to pull troops out of Syria from the Iranian-backed group HTS. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres who was in Turkey on Thursday said that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s embassy was a \u201cmove against international law\u201d. Trump also told journalists that he s no longer working to reach a withdrawal agreement from Syria. Trump said the deal was not done yet and that he wanted to go to Russia, China and France to negotiate more. Trump said the deal was not final and he is not finished negotiating. The announcement came a few hours after the United States struck an air strike in northern Syria. Trump was speaking on his own turf at the beginning of a major visit to Europe. In Germany, he told reporters his plan to disengage from Syria \u201cis not a strategy but it is a policy,\u201d but he cautioned against trying to force a military withdrawal. \u201cJust because it wasn\u2019t approved by the House of Representatives, does not mean that it can be a policy that doesn\u2019t respect the intelligence community,\u201d Trump said. He continued to say the United States needs to strike when it sees good reason to do so, including in Turkey, where US troops are seen as a possible target. Trump\u2019s decision has sparked outrage throughout the world and led the European Union to call for a meeting between the Trump administration and leaders of its allies. The foreign ministers of three European Union nations \u2013 Britain, France and Germany \u2013 met at 10 a.m. in Brussels. EU leaders will meet later Thursday. Turkey has been at a loggerheads with Washington as the United States has been leading the fight against Syria based group IS. It also says it is on the front lines in a regional conflict as it tries to protect its eastern border and Kurdish-dominated regions from the YPG militia which Washington considers a terrorist organization. Turkey wants to stop the flow of IS fighters across the border as well as the flow of weapons to them on Turkish soil. It has said that the YPG militia and the Kurdish militias it supports need to be pushed back in Syria after the U.S. airstrike Friday.

{"prompt":"Chicago on Monday sued to prevent the Trump administration from enforcing new policies that would withhold money from so-called sanctuary cities that deny U.S. immigration officials access to local jails . The lawsuit , filed","text":"Chicago on Monday sued to prevent the Trump administration from enforcing new policies that would withhold money from so-called sanctuary cities that deny U.S. immigration officials access to local jails. The lawsuit, filed against U.S. Attorney David Wilson III in Chicago\u2019s federal court, says the Trump administration has taken over policing immigration in the country and now has the authority to punish sanctuary cities.\n\u201cTrump is sending immigrants directly to jail,\u201d the petition reads in part. \u201cTrump will destroy the ability of the immigrant community to protect itself from harm. Instead of taking away the resources needed to keep these communities safe, Trump is taking away their ability to hold governments accountable to safeguarding themselves.\u201d\nThe lawsuit filed on the same day that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced $35 million in grants to six local governments for immigration law enforcement in sanctuary jurisdictions.\nImmigration legal services organization ACLU of Illinois said in court filings in Chicago that the sanctuary policies violate both the American Constitution and Illinois\u2019 own law by refusing local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal authorities in efforts to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, even though local law enforcement agencies have \u201cgood cause\u201d to suspect they are violating other laws.\n\u201cThese lawsuit demonstrates that state and local governments who support their communities\u2019 right to control their own police are not welcome under Trump,\u201d said Chris Pace, executive director of ACLU of Illinois.\nThe lawsuit comes in the wake of the release of ICE\u2019s proposal detailing plans for a law enforcement task force to focus on sanctuary cities.\nThe plan was released Monday, the same day municipalities announced funding proposals for immigrant law enforcement officials, or ICE said in court papers. However, the Trump administration announced a separate proposal Friday to give the federal government the power to force local jails to allow U.S. agents into jails, which it says would help U.S. law enforcement conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the criminal activities of immigrants.\nThis comes as officials in cities across the country are preparing for potential consequences of changes proposed by the Trump administration to immigration laws. On Monday New York City sued to block changes proposed by the Trump administration that would expand the city\u2019s sanctuary city policy and force prosecutors to use evidence from deportation searches against immigrants.\nA similar suit was filed in Indiana Monday by the state Attorney General\u2019s office. The suit is challenging Indiana\u2019s state law, which states an indigent immigrant does not have to wait for a judge to rule on whether to accept relief from deportation.\nIn recent years, a few cities and governors in other states have issued resolutions opposing sanctuary policies and supporting the federal law enforcement crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions, although many officials have not done so publicly before.\nAt least four other states already have sanctuary policies. California, Georgia, Nebraska, and Texas have the kind of laws that prohibit local police or prosecutors from cooperating with ICE on immigration-related cases.\nIn Chicago, local police departments were previously able to provide information to federal agents to conduct surveillance, but now a law enforcement official must review and approve all requests.\nICE officials in Texas announced early this year they would take local jails under their authority whenever they suspected an inmate had a criminal record. ICE would review criminal records from the local jails, and if they were suspect, would send federal agents to the jail to conduct searches.","token_len":688,"entropy":[5.1349,2.7287,8.6434,3.8962,2.556,1.2589,5.4291,0.4868,0.0579,2.6956,5.1567,5.151,1.4001,1.4247,5.6496,4.3353,0.1157,6.7642,0.0213,0.0003,0.7849,0.0471,2.5455,5.8425,5.7565,0.0006,0.0007,0.005,5.0883,2.2523,2.8646,0.0297,4.4841,1.7192,1.1799,2.6462,1.021,1.3436,0.3994,4.6362,5.317,0.0059,0.0019,0.0021,2.158,7.5121,10.5888,6.6096,1.4928,3.3087,17.1848,8.3813,5.303,2.6537,1.1121,0.9328,3.1792,0.9585,1.118,0.0413,1.8682,4.5717,5.3174,4.5635,5.602,3.3352,1.3372,3.0533,1.9813,5.7006,2.1048,2.0429,1.4107,0.0467,5.4423,2.6988,0.1599,1.978,0.384,16.5008,5.9945,7.4647,3.1728,5.9139,7.4018,6.0416,0.3658,2.3726,2.0679,10.0266,7.4715,2.0966,5.8642,2.3597,3.59,0.5007,0.1437,5.888,0.2404,2.7814,4.3659,7.2199,1.5207,4.7998,0.1369,2.863,4.9645,0.4306,0.2386,4.5508,2.8207,1.4222,4.1532,1.8714,5.6292,1.4239,4.0958,3.8768,1.9016,2.9143,2.9874,0.2046,3.4968,4.1969,0.5911,0.0836,0.1659,1.5921,1.3594,3.4888,0.6202,2.2888,2.551,0.0088,4.5573,6.7686,0.0484,4.2812,9.1464,0.0329,5.7494,1.1973,3.0424,2.9036,0.7777,3.1965,1.829,4.6505,2.1395,4.6386,1.2609,0.0252,1.8695,3.7492,0.0008,0.0015,0.0013,2.3863,0.0278,0.0014,0.0004,2.3728,6.5385,4.837,0.2491,0.266,2.3377,0.6563,5.5198,3.0611,2.5251,2.4015,5.2302,5.1246,0.1534,3.3964,5.7482,1.5732,3.1796,1.1656,6.4224,0.3019,6.1,4.4545,4.4419,5.0519,0.7669,0.7775,2.7909,1.7666,5.8787,1.2476,3.7258,1.5143,0.9451,0.9093,4.2725,2.4269,2.9046,4.1925,0.5834,4.1151,2.8476,0.3145,5.0549,13.6378,2.0043,10.672,3.2365,4.6081,3.4328,4.1703,1.7652,0.0154,2.7696,2.8071,2.0624,0.085,0.9185,3.1679,2.5189,6.2754,0.0135,6.8472,2.2943,0.3432,1.5784,0.1764,3.3166,3.4491,1.7644,3.6505,0.6182,0.0282,1.0194,1.6007,12.0924,0.7371,7.6994,3.1157,0.1127,2.2612,0.303,4.0414,3.0482,0.7638,1.7622,5.3997,1.4272,0.3537,0.269,3.1965,0.4824,5.0152,9.5731,7.4639,0.8126,5.9246,0.8694,0.3027,1.3072,5.4711,5.3653,4.9377,2.7712,7.1162,0.8364,9.3767,0.4628,6.1466,0.878,0.8115,3.3666,3.6217,2.0354,4.9581,4.3049,1.821,3.1894,2.7215,0.8139,2.5849,5.6094,9.2059,0.2168,2.0294,0.0188,0.0471,2.1324,0.6179,0.0289,0.3127,0.5412,2.5663,1.4021,3.3525,3.1263,0.8007,0.3787,0.0077,1.6127,2.958,0.1797,5.9523,9.6544,0.6053,0.4611,7.5905,9.1126,3.8695,1.5044,1.5547,5.548,0.6006,5.5236,0.0325,0.7006,3.7196,0.1788,2.9512,0.4247,0.8757,1.2816,2.1212,3.6567,2.5031,3.0117,4.5209,1.8304,3.5581,1.2527,0.0104,11.4184,4.3493,4.2873,6.8458,0.7695,6.9299,2.3449,0.0019,5.391,2.4075,6.3017,1.0567,9.5952,3.2547,3.1465,2.1217,1.7571,5.5873,0.0174,1.4541,4.0894,0.0536,3.5467,3.1054,2.9654,2.7311,4.99,2.1197,4.4225,2.9468,1.8906,0.0509,1.7983,1.5302,0.0322,4.2443,1.024,5.5103,0.4238,4.2459,3.7608,0.0006,0.0014,0.0081,7.2735,3.3917,4.1912,2.8564,2.7498,3.2745,2.2169,1.258,4.6726,6.1667,0.0004,0.0012,0.0041,1.1862,0.0081,6.4768,2.9559,1.9401,2.6797,4.704,0.1179,1.751,5.1566,4.6146,0.347,2.4996,1.0329,0.2722,4.8446,3.5793,1.7814,5.4515,1.1639,4.1212,0.803,0.0928,0.2608,0.9594,3.357,1.4815,4.5852,7.2508,1.992,6.6086,4.085,0.235,1.0125,0.5211,0.0353,1.5458,2.5907,0.95,0.8289,4.6087,1.4215,7.3626,0.1465,0.6294,7.0298,1.5297,1.2136,4.9324,2.2782,0.1334,0.8013,0.7503,0.0959,1.753,0.2299,4.3916,0.893,3.5622,7.7906,0.1215,0.1591,2.9081,2.0798,1.2414,2.7947,4.0567,7.06,0.2718,3.8409,4.8439,2.1788,5.1997,7.4877,2.915,1.6859,1.7286,0.7782,4.2094,3.7366,1.6252,1.4309,0.3235,0.4273,5.5767,4.9521,2.5437,1.4167,4.6495,2.4904,0.0129,5.7068,0.1774,0.1056,0.1605,1.9922,1.7788,1.4261,2.9089,4.6245,4.3979,6.2272,0.0087,0.0422,3.958,0.5665,2.7094,0.6238,3.1034,6.0778,6.812,0.42,1.7686,6.0807,0.0039,0.3217,0.6707,5.1729,1.5529,1.3126,0.855,0.3251,4.7845,0.3462,3.2739,1.7689,3.6321,7.94,0.9431,0.2275,1.0981,0.7656,2.52,5.0573,1.496,0.3218,4.0735,5.1508,1.5127,2.712,6.7809,2.1056,3.9916,0.0734,0.2518,4.9205,6.5878,4.4295,1.8762,1.4857,2.496,6.5995,2.3982,3.6341,3.7566,1.8747,6.6296,1.232,0.9596,2.2956,2.3439,4.9398,3.1071,5.8475,1.626,2.6718,3.5536,0.0479,3.5921,6.6154,0.3256,0.6131,5.5674,1.4004,2.9785,2.4174,0.6488,5.4026,0.5354,4.1991,0.8481,2.4915,3.4857,1.0463,5.282,0.0934,4.8189,0.405,1.1427,2.4645,0.8446,5.5226,7.112,0.0014,2.1119,1.1506,4.9,1.4886,2.2013,4.8041,2.8242,0.037,3.3519,0.0517,2.1983,2.7491,1.0174,3.3759,0.0347,1.9909,0.5,0.6628,2.5944,3.1144,0.2549,4.6421,1.9031,2.5441,4.0874,5.2962,3.7872,0.0093,5.3436,3.1212,1.1883,2.5614,2.1088,3.7928,4.4031,4.2623,3.4253,0.9612,2.9055,5.1205,3.7446,1.0355,1.78,7.058,6.5616,3.2754,2.1374,2.9381,1.689,3.0427,0.8803,5.1723,2.363,2.543,5.228,4.512,5.7715,1.2228,0.8459,1.9807,0.7421,4.7533,6.887,3.7836,4.326,2.1709,3.6055,9.8603,1.291,6.1608,2.675,4.3531,2.2927,3.5818,0.7652,0.4718,0.9727,2.9878,5.5266,5.1688,4.4825,0.6761,3.7344,2.2962,2.2204,0.706,1.7824,1.424,2.4955,2.1457,3.1189,5.7116,0.7128,2.2724,3.3839,5.4228,0.1976,0.2582,1.7434,1.2425,0.8077,2.8771,3.4748,1.1822]}
{"prompt":"The Syrian government has accepted a Russian suggestion of a ceasefire in the besieged rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta , U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura told reporters on Tuesday . I was just informed","text":"The Syrian government has accepted a Russian suggestion of a ceasefire in the besieged rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura told reporters on Tuesday. I was just informed that the Syrian government agreed to a ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta,\" De Mistura said. \"The idea was presented by the Russian side. I was just informed that the Syrian government agreed on this. At the moment the ceasefire is not yet implemented,\" De Mistura told reporters. The statement came after Russia, the UN's top power broker on the Syrian war, warned that a partial military ceasefire to stop the bombardment by Syrian government forces on civilians could be broken if the Syrian opposition and the Arab League did not support it. I am looking forward to today, for there was a willingness to stop the violence and for a complete, definitive and serious ceasefire in Syria,\" said Lavrov at his weekly office meeting with De Mistura. He said that the international community had asked the Syrian opposition group and the head of the Arab League to call for a full-fledged ceasefire and a solution in Geneva. He said, however, that the dialogue is still happening as the Syrian opposition group wants to find a military solution. De Mistura said that negotiations have already started on Wednesday between the opposition and the regime in Geneva. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the Syrian regime has shown little interest in the idea of a military solution to the crisis and is seeking to maintain the pressure on the opposition group, with a target of halting the civil war. She also accused the United States of blocking negotiations between the powers that want to end the Syrian war and Syrian opposition and the regime. Earlier on Tuesday, Russia, Iran and Turkey signed a cease-fire agreement in Moscow with Damascus, amid reports that the Syrian Government was ready for this arrangement. The agreement was signed during a five-hour-long summit hosted by President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Russia has supported the Syrian regime, which it considers to be a legitimate government of Syria during the armed conflicts. On Sunday, a civil war had again been declared in Syria, as the government used heavy weapons to bombard the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. Russia's Foreign Ministry confirmed that the Russian Government has sent a message to the opposition in Damascus to declare unilateral ceasefire, if they were ready to do so. A ceasefire has already been agreed on in the rebel-held Damascus suburbs, near Damascus, but it began to crumble within hours after it was agreed. According to Syrian state media, a meeting between the U.S. ambassador to Moscow and Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem on Monday \"could not make the expected progress\". In its statement of the previous day, the American Mission said that the diplomatic talks aimed to reach a way to a ceasefire were held with a \"positive attitude\" from both sides of the conflict. According to a report, the talks between the Syrian official and the American representative were cancelled because the Syrian official stopped it, saying that there was no time to discuss it. De Mistura also said, however, on Tuesday that Russia has proposed another ceasefire at the United Nations, which would cover both parts of Syria's conflict, with the conditions that are applicable in both areas. However, according to the UN diplomat, the Syrian government is still unwilling to take part in the proposed negotiations.","token_len":689,"entropy":[9.1918,1.7877,1.2897,6.2391,2.8039,5.178,7.7677,3.6876,2.0299,1.8801,1.7112,1.0922,3.8131,4.0193,0.0645,0.0152,4.2711,0.8339,7.0429,0.1079,0.0004,0.0,0.9324,7.1125,0.0302,0.7423,0.0449,6.4543,0.4708,0.0514,0.0017,0.0052,0.0002,0.0,2.4055,0.7024,1.2451,1.7626,0.2138,10.0369,4.3903,5.2386,3.0871,1.0908,1.1721,2.1866,0.36,4.1155,0.2065,0.9992,0.3681,0.7592,1.3685,0.0019,0.0003,0.0003,2.9678,2.5467,0.0036,0.0004,0.3425,0.6742,2.2209,1.8969,5.3407,1.5327,5.1647,1.7924,0.6389,1.3749,1.8265,2.3002,2.5123,2.2209,2.8478,0.4553,0.18,0.0857,0.1953,0.0276,0.0853,8.9946,4.6218,2.7441,5.6941,0.7088,2.1781,2.3109,3.0443,1.004,2.0751,3.0663,2.9684,3.3112,1.7409,0.0011,0.001,2.6939,0.1801,0.6842,3.1309,5.4306,1.5269,1.2547,2.7477,3.5295,1.9159,5.1713,2.7237,2.5251,7.6572,3.7215,3.8169,1.4424,1.9356,4.378,0.0597,4.2826,1.33,2.7391,6.4133,5.8569,3.3508,6.187,3.5235,0.6446,4.754,3.8143,2.4864,0.7146,0.1383,3.4124,4.5864,2.6877,1.6532,5.3026,2.4795,1.3372,3.0085,3.066,2.937,1.8477,5.5055,0.2875,4.0464,0.0489,4.0403,1.5611,0.2611,6.7039,2.5185,6.6272,0.9381,0.0328,6.2564,4.3315,4.6002,4.6808,3.5408,1.2237,6.4074,1.0912,5.4411,0.7388,5.3778,1.8724,3.4877,2.3184,5.2463,4.1513,6.2112,3.2859,6.2866,0.7371,1.7749,3.9999,1.7147,2.4664,4.8991,3.5733,3.7693,1.4903,9.9527,0.7773,1.1309,4.2585,0.0283,0.0014,0.7152,2.8297,1.1964,1.7919,1.3575,4.3288,0.1379,2.4017,4.5854,1.3646,0.6942,2.7686,5.7728,3.4912,0.9882,8.0582,0.0178,0.4177,3.2074,0.0088,0.5554,5.5044,1.3041,0.6033,3.2665,2.5016,0.5644,0.6816,2.5821,2.2498,6.3981,3.4712,5.2971,0.7691,2.9482,0.8958,4.3886,1.0829,0.0244,0.1984,1.2177,7.1445,4.9448,1.742,7.1033,4.5936,1.4854,1.21,1.1893,2.7593,5.2295,0.6073,3.6917,0.3693,7.4944,0.0355,1.2818,2.1583,0.0046,0.0016,0.7764,0.8765,5.4104,2.9535,2.6464,1.1479,1.788,6.7873,2.7797,0.4011,3.5345,0.5952,0.4713,3.7699,2.1324,2.0022,0.8318,5.3694,1.4809,1.8861,1.4887,0.0715,0.0,0.0001,0.0022,0.5554,1.4744,1.0877,2.0344,2.754,2.159,5.6563,4.8044,1.0519,0.0546,1.7722,4.8233,0.1162,0.3533,2.3943,0.6639,1.7681,0.1617,1.8596,2.3048,3.4499,3.872,0.8993,5.2534,1.754,3.9956,0.4951,0.7141,1.354,2.4933,2.7224,4.889,2.7328,6.2189,0.8283,5.4101,0.7807,6.1952,0.0227,0.9566,1.61,2.6391,3.3498,0.5123,3.1877,0.1315,0.4074,4.957,4.0705,4.1876,0.3197,8.2657,3.9186,4.3346,0.5046,1.8676,0.1313,3.0891,1.2253,0.8445,5.402,1.9929,2.974,1.3559,3.4165,1.098,6.4228,1.3928,0.2543,0.1184,3.1457,3.5891,3.1081,0.4588,1.5852,3.7401,0.4651,4.4297,0.049,0.0006,0.5928,1.4075,6.3304,3.6893,4.7182,1.4021,6.3253,3.7783,0.4323,1.2527,2.1424,6.3749,2.5558,2.9487,2.9532,6.9001,5.1913,0.5627,1.6703,1.5067,2.2195,0.9556,4.3121,1.1555,5.3331,0.0579,2.1461,5.5447,0.0674,2.767,5.1825,0.0597,3.8117,0.741,0.0113,1.0451,3.0764,3.0563,0.0688,1.2509,0.0534,2.0014,2.7256,1.2825,1.1368,0.2684,0.2046,0.7532,3.4087,2.6055,5.3121,0.5857,1.3854,2.8999,3.1351,1.6654,2.8976,2.5867,1.7221,0.0325,1.1853,5.1906,0.7718,3.9269,2.8825,7.132,0.53,4.5877,4.5791,2.985,3.9459,2.7109,0.0747,2.9768,7.8258,0.2065,5.3418,7.3189,4.7018,2.1489,0.3273,2.6413,1.2296,3.5241,1.6681,1.9057,5.4834,3.5132,1.5109,1.2236,4.9189,1.6711,2.3065,0.0617,0.0256,4.8424,0.0178,0.0004,0.0006,1.7835,4.2095,1.8173,2.4029,0.2876,4.4598,1.0276,1.6168,2.7511,6.0807,2.1401,3.8507,1.6807,4.4091,0.246,0.7578,2.5118,3.1678,1.3574,2.1117,5.7058,10.1536,1.7695,2.4573,5.5543,3.4283,4.5795,4.2956,0.472,2.073,0.0418,0.3286,3.8642,2.3912,2.2542,2.7521,0.0759,1.1309,2.9124,1.2191,1.6363,3.7679,0.0661,0.0258,6.5307,1.9979,1.475,5.8672,1.9719,1.882,2.0176,1.7995,8.5023,1.8448,3.6619,4.9542,1.1796,2.7685,3.1212,0.3086,1.8954,1.7775,4.3494,0.0008,3.4115,2.5826,0.7764,0.1511,2.8666,5.1777,1.2567,1.0156,4.9683,0.0006,0.4775,0.5014,4.0909,0.2414,3.0353,0.6166,2.2675,2.989,0.1012,2.5268,0.0002,0.4959,0.0242,0.2434,0.0012,0.0038,2.5275,1.3216,5.2592,5.8152,2.8597,6.5375,2.7244,8.2429,2.0206,3.2572,3.8152,4.6636,1.0835,4.5962,3.2253,6.9857,0.172,0.1157,0.4937,6.0619,5.3485,3.7936,1.0091,1.1417,7.1699,4.0657,5.4456,2.5414,2.8197,0.3475,7.6493,1.6647,5.1775,1.687,3.6499,4.3492,3.6103,2.416,2.3623,4.5912,4.0167,1.2434,5.0373,2.3354,0.0778,4.2521,0.0264,1.1225,0.5217,4.3703,0.0016,2.621,2.541,2.9716,0.7982,3.1506,3.8785,0.4901,2.2921,7.141,1.2203,0.9252,3.51,3.8885,1.476,5.458,2.2194,1.6144,1.9783,4.4058,7.2629,5.8306,2.3427,3.4933,0.9085,3.4105,0.4454,0.6921,3.5389,0.6767,2.043,2.4535,0.7271,5.063,0.0111,0.0008,2.8605,0.7864,4.7709,1.6223,0.0062,6.1964,0.4702,0.2828,2.617,2.7916,6.4263,5.9309,1.5474,5.1524,0.639,4.3752,0.0104,1.6136,2.2256,1.8348,5.3994,4.0379,3.3724,0.0054,2.7245,4.6907,2.8992,1.9111,3.1121,1.4449,7.0532,2.7818,2.4485,6.5113,2.4283,3.1643,2.0354,0.368,4.8371,0.0185,5.1532,0.0015,1.1029,3.3163,6.6267,0.3679,1.1896,2.5595,0.7644,2.0941,2.4167,4.049,0.0292,3.8785,1.1544,0.1168,0.8829,5.97,4.7234,0.9293]}

The agreement would not be a legal binding agreement on either side but rather an agreement under which the two sides can make the necessary arrangements to avoid customs barriers, for instance. For more on that, watch the video above.\nIn France, the President noted that talks between the EU and the UK \u201cmust continue\u201d and expressed concern about the impact of the uncertainty on businesses.

{"prompt":"The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to go to a conference committee to resolve differences between its tax legislation and a rival version passed by the House of Representatives , moving the Republican-led Congress a","text":"The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to go to a conference committee to resolve differences between its tax legislation and a rival version passed by the House of Representatives, moving the Republican-led Congress a step closer to passing the law this fall and eliminating the threat of an unprecedented political standoff that has paralyzed the nation\u2019s top legislative body.\nThe Senate voted 74-26 in favor of the conference committee and an overwhelming majority of Republicans favored a resolution that would preserve the tax bill, which would be the first law signed into law by President Donald Trump next week. The House of Representatives approved the budget over the summer.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate voted to move the tax bill to a conference committee in a measure that would be the most ambitious step so far in the fight for tax reform for millions of Americans.\nThe measure now heads to the president, with no chance of approval, unless the Republican GOP can strike a deal with Democrats and pass it on the floor \u2014 something unlikely in the time of the upcoming election year.\nBut with many GOP senators willing to accept compromises they had earlier rejected, there is little chance of the tax bill failing the Senate\u2019s committee and the bill could possibly be signed into law by Trump.\nThe current tax bill, signed into law by Trump only three weeks ago, would increase the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% from the current 35%, would eliminate corporate and individual tax deductions for health care costs, and would tax all business income at the highest potential tax rate. The tax bill eliminates the deduction for mortgage interest, and would reduce the deduction for business expenses that were not related to production.\nThat was followed by an agreement with the White House, which indicated Republican members would be prepared to accept compromise language which Democrats rejected earlier in the week in the fight over a series of tax provisions.\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., aided in the enduring of tax-related legislation through a series of phone calls with his Washington colleagues, and was credited with winning the tax fight.\nOne of three tax laws signed by President Trump this summer, the law is expected to generate billions of dollars in tax revenues that could be earmarked to support spending on infrastructure projects.\nRepublicans in both the House and Senate on Wednesday signed off on a series of compromise provisions \u2014 some of which had been put forward by New York Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer \u2014 that would provide for additional tax relief that Democrats say is essential for the budget and tax overhaul to come to pass.\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., arrived for Thursday\u2019s meeting on Capitol Hill. Senators discussed and then voted to move the tax bill to a conference committee over the tax provisions that had been negotiated and agreed to between the two parties. The bill now heads to the president, with no chance of approval, unless the Republican controlled Senate can strike a deal with Democrats and pass it on the floor \u2014 something unlikely in the time of the upcoming election year.\nThe tax bill signed into law by President Donald Trump only three weeks ago would increase the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% from the current 35%, would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% until 2025, would eliminate corporate and individual tax deductions for health care costs, and would tax all business income at the highest potential tax

{"prompt":"The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on two North Korean officials for their roles in developing the country s ballistic missiles , the latest step in a campaign to press Pyongyang to give up","text":"The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on two North Korean officials for their roles in developing the country s ballistic missiles, the latest step in a campaign to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and ballistic programs.\nAt a briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the U.S. intelligence community had determined that the two men, whom he did not name, were responsible for the development of ballistic missile launch sites.\nU.S. State Councilor John Kerry said the sanctions were aimed at targeting the supply lines that supported North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.\nEarlier, President Trump approved a sweeping military review of North Korean defenses in response to Pyongyang s new long-range ballistic missile development. The U.S. believes it will increase the risks of conflict in the region, Spicer said, adding that the administration had discussed possible steps with allies to reinforce the blockade against North Korea.\nNorth Korea on Friday test-fired a new long-range rocket engine, but it did not cause any worry over the development of weapons of mass destruction, said a senior U.S. administration official. U.S. intelligence has long said that North Korea has been building a ballistic missile submarine capable of launching long-range projectiles, he said.\nHowever, a second official said the failure of North Korea s missile test represented \" no meaningful progress\" over its nuclear program. That is because the missile test could only have launched a payload carrying a nuclear warhead weighing only several kilograms at a maximum flight of just a kilometer, the second official said.\nWhile North Korea s nuclear missile program is believed to require heavy, more complex hardware, Kim d proposed the nuclear bomb after the collapse of an earlier nuclear and hydrogen fuel program on Tuesday. Washington blames North Korea for the disastrous 2018 Korean Peninsula test-fires that killed a U.S. soldier and sparked a military clampdown by the United States and its allies.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that he anticipated that any future North Korean test would be a nuclear one.\nTrump has repeatedly expressed frustration at U.S. pressure, which he said has not been effective. In May, North Korea s foreign ministry said he should be willing to listen to him, as he had pledged earlier in the year.\n\"We should have the dialogue to be open and honest. You need to know I am listening. I m going to talk to you like it is a man,\" Trump said in a New York radio interview in May.\nNorth Korea has said that it would consider a U.S. apology and even the return of U.S. diplomats, but so far Trump s comments have not touched North Korean sensitivities.\nThe Trump administration s stance toward the North Korean leader is similar to that under his predecessor. In November 2018, Trump said he opposed military action against North Korea, pointing out that there are alternatives. Trump reiterated his stance on Tuesday, before the test-fire.\nSpicer said he planned to meet his U.S. counterparts in Europe and Asia over the next days to discuss how to respond to the new rocket

{"prompt":"Polish President Andrzej Duda has signed into law two bills overhauling the judiciary , he said on Wednesday , in defiance of European Union criticism that the legislation undermines the rule of law in central","text":"Polish President Andrzej Duda has signed into law two bills overhauling the judiciary, he said on Wednesday, in defiance of European Union criticism that the legislation undermines the rule of law in central Europe\u2019s largest member state.\nMr. Duda, the son of the late Polish president Lech Walesa, received a formal approval of the laws from the cabinet, signed by top government officials and his acting chief of staff on Tuesday, before he flew to the United States to attend the G-8 summit and a conference on the U.S. presidency.\nHe said the changes had already been approved by the European Parliament late last year.\nMr. Duda told Reuters his team had not given the cabinet\u2019s nod before meeting reporters.\n\u201cThis is the first time we have been able to meet with the Polish cabinet before the decision was made, \u201d Mr. Duda said.\nHis decision to implement the laws, introduced by a group of opposition lawmakers and supported by conservative lawmakers, has been controversial, especially since they have been adopted amidst a crackdown on alleged political opponents.\nPoland\u2019s parliament last week passed the two laws, which will allow political parties to pick judges and the resignation or dismissal of judges, without having to meet the traditional quotas set by law.\nOn Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Poland\u2019s laws could have a negative impact on the ruling bloc\u2019s relations with the central European country, which has already sought EU membership in the past.\nThe laws were passed in the Polish parliament after several months of talks between the opposition and the conservative lawmakers.\nThe coalition in power, which includes the Democratic Left party, has already said that the law will not be applied, in particular in relation to the election of judges, as it has not been made clear what criteria judges in Poland will have to meet.\nThe law, however, bans the nomination of candidates from political parties by the government and judges and may affect the nomination of judges by the current cabinet to the Constitutional Tribunal, a court that has been one of the key critics of Mr. Duda\u2019s administration.\nMr. Duda has repeatedly defended the law, saying it improves the quality of the courts and helps to strengthen democracy in the country.\nMr. Duda has taken a harder line with regard to alleged corruption by several ministers in the ruling coalition, saying they deserve to be punished as they are in fact committing crimes.\nCritics say the laws show a weakening of Poland\u2019s judiciary, which has been widely criticised for several cases including a jailing of a top official of the intelligence agency on charges of corruption, a ban on free speech on the Internet and an assault on the freedoms of the press.\nThe Polish government has in the past accused its critics of being part of an attempt to undermine Mr. Duda, who replaced his father as he headed to prison for political reasons at the age of 24.\nThe opposition has said the ruling coalition is afraid of the law\u2019s passage because of potential political threats to Mr. Duda.\nThe European Commission said in a statement that a vote of no confidence in Mr. Duda by Mr. Duda\u2019s political opponents could lead to a withdrawal of EU funding from Poland and called on the government to put the laws into effect to prevent conflict with the

{"prompt":"The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country s war on drugs , saying officers fired only in self-defence and","text":"The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country s war on drugs, saying officers fired only in self-defence and were carrying out a legitimate operation.\nJake Chaparino, the national police chief, says the murder squad in Manila, known as the Marawi Group, was carrying out an \"autonomous mission\" to fight drug crime in the city of 1.1 million people.\nThe squad has fought thousands of drug-related raids and gunned down several groups of drug dealers this year. Its name is often quoted in drug and police killings. Some victims were decapitated or dumped at a cliff to appear as suicide cases so they would not be blamed.\nMany fear the group is connected to the military and police and is targeting rival factions of gangs.\nMr Chaparino insisted on Wednesday morning that the killings stemmed from a \"security operation\" involving only the police and others, not the armed forces.\n\"At no time did the police resort to excessive force. And in the event of any unlawful acts committed by our men of law, we only resort to those weapons that we have,\" he told state television.\n\"We don't have the privilege of using military weapons in public. We do not and will not use military weapons in our fight, no matter how vicious it may appear from the media,\" he added.\nThe head of the force also denied accusations that agents had killed civilians during the violence. \"This is not the case. None of our men showed any interest in civilians. There were instances where members of the Marawi Group opened fire at other agencies' personnel in order to retaliate,\" he said. \"We do not give in to intimidation and neither will we.\"\nMr Chaparino said some of the victims were in self-defence, some were unarmed or suspected of involvement with drug trafficking, while some had been seen trying to flee the scene.\n\"What if they had just been killed by the other side? Why is the police attacking the other side anyway?\" he asked.\nMr Chaparino said the Marawi Group's head, Donal Dela Santis, had been killed by snipers during a raid on a hideout.\nHe added that there were more than 100 people on the list who had already been indicted for drug-related offences.\nThe Philippine Department of Justice said on Thursday that about two dozen members of the army - including two generals and a captain - were under investigation for allegedly collaborating with drug traffickers.\nThe department identified about 200 suspects.\nPrime Minister Luis Guillermo Solis said on Wednesday that military officials had been taken off duty over allegations that their involvement had allowed the killing of some drug dealers.\nHe promised, however, that military forces would be brought back in if they were found guilty. \"We will not turn a blind eye to what we consider misconduct,\" he told reporters.\nThe military says it is only cooperating with police in drug-hunt operations such as air strikes.\nIt has been under fire for alleged involvement in the brutal crackdown following the May 12 uprising in the mostly Muslim town that left several hundred dead.\nThe killings in Metro Manila are the worst of many drug-related incidents, which have led to a backlash among Filipinos against corrupt politicians.\nSeveral Filipino lawmakers and police union leaders are demanding a full investigation into the recent

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) as \u201c anti-Trump \u201d and questioned its role during the 2016 presidential campaign , amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the election","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) as \u201c anti-Trump \u201d and questioned its role during the 2016 presidential campaign, amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the election.\nAs Trump\u2019s campaign to retake the presidency against Democrat Hillary Clinton stalled in the closing weeks, he accused Facebook of allowing Russia to post disinformation on its platform which he said helped lead to the election.\n\u201c Facebook allowed the Russia propaganda machine to get things going that helped prop up their disinformation campaigns, \u201d Trump told an event organized by a conservative group he chairs.\n\u201c They lied to us about it, \u201d he added. \u201c You know how they lied to us about it! They lied to us! I won a fair election. \u201d\nThe Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified during a congressional hearing in January, where he said Moscow has used the social media platform in recent years to sow discord in the United States and abroad, but he did not mention how the campaign against Clinton might have been influenced.\nZuckerberg said the company is investing heavily to combat Kremlin activity.\n\u201c We have not been sitting back waiting for some other person to give us a threat \u2014 we\u2019ve made a game-changing change to our privacy, terms and service and we\u2019re investing in it with deep money that we will not see coming for the next few years, \u201d he told Congress.\nTrump says Russia \u2018created chaos\u2019 during US 2016 election\nFacebook said in a statement that Trump falsely claimed it influenced the outcome of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\u201c We do not believe it helped President Trump, \u201d the company said. \u201c In fact, our research showed this campaign spent substantially less than any other on Facebook ads. \u201d\nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, who has faced criticism he may have censored conservatives more than liberals, defended the actions of the company.\n\u201c We\u2019ve never censored content, \u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201c We do not censor any content... We believe our platform is a free forum for people to talk, and we ask people to treat each other with respect. \u201c\nDuring the last few weeks of the race, Facebook removed posts from Clinton and Trump\u2019s campaigns that challenged each other\u2019s claims, as well as a piece about a WikiLeaks leak of a supposed wire letter that appeared to accuse Trump of having an extramarital affair.\nThe posts were part of an alleged large-scale Russian effort to influence the election, according to multiple investigations and public reports.\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s longtime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was indicted for possible fraud in the campaign.\nZuckerberg also appeared last week on conservative cable news show FiveThirtyEight, where he spoke directly to the president-elect, describing the potential influence as \u201c an issue. \u201c\nThe comments came in response to an interview the President-elect made with Rolling Stone, where Trump said \u201c I see Putin\u2019s hand in everything, \u201d but \u201c it is a conspiracy. \u201c\nSome Republicans have questioned whether Trump\u2019s statements were aimed at trying to get support for further action against Russia, or as a way to keep the Democratic Party loyal while Trump\u2019s campaign was stalemated and he was preparing for a transition.","token_len":692,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.5734,2.2629,4.2072,8.21,3.4787,3.7582,7.7109,1.7354,0.1494,0.5583,3.0701,16.7051,5.7571,11.3118,0.0174,5.8758,4.9973,7.0272,0.7808,5.2632,2.1777,3.4842,6.3078,0.4002,2.638,1.066,1.2034,2.5247,5.5817,7.9686,0.7696,3.6085,1.2034,1.1476,0.1292,0.1189,1.3123,0.4591,0.2189,17.2642,3.2867,12.0423,7.2267,0.3053,2.1157,5.5416,5.0772,0.2722,3.4919,7.4975,1.2521,0.013,0.0168,7.6015,1.8461,1.1033,7.2944,1.558,1.8613,2.7601,4.4959,0.7544,0.5575,6.0578,3.6797,0.2533,6.6433,5.1458,2.5779,1.8466,0.8021,6.3077,2.8032,0.7596,3.4456,5.0577,0.388,0.7277,1.0266,0.3107,0.2141,5.2053,0.7566,2.8989,8.0406,2.1243,4.9635,4.3547,2.5842,0.407,6.0574,7.5863,3.8081,4.416,4.9132,8.7063,0.0701,5.1429,8.7982,2.4109,1.4703,8.6637,4.2777,2.6421,2.9785,4.4254,4.8589,3.8844,0.0687,4.0857,2.9412,1.8297,5.2867,6.1791,1.1036,0.2566,1.8387,0.3436,6.0031,5.8348,1.4239,2.0583,1.3949,3.1507,1.1847,1.6701,1.1986,0.9295,2.7366,0.347,2.968,0.5444,5.321,1.7439,3.5342,2.0666,2.9227,0.9039,0.3205,0.8168,0.4569,6.5675,2.5719,1.3528,0.2907,0.2574,3.36,3.8571,5.168,4.4861,5.1395,2.5135,1.8493,3.0059,2.2103,2.3483,2.7476,3.7695,2.2338,6.622,0.003,6.1611,3.7293,1.2579,2.823,0.0923,2.2697,2.6668,2.4731,3.1665,0.2173,1.7863,7.4265,4.074,3.432,2.462,1.0734,1.3125,0.3364,3.7419,4.5463,0.8737,0.1953,3.0112,1.0671,1.8017,0.7839,1.4342,0.0026,1.2739,3.6241,1.8846,3.8597,1.7929,2.3694,0.0376,3.3416,3.7234,1.7566,3.9039,3.8152,1.1749,5.2078,0.3373,1.9882,2.6025,2.5304,0.1583,3.968,0.0212,0.0039,1.5974,1.9373,1.9989,2.8495,6.4107,2.4105,3.1263,2.4185,5.696,5.1437,1.9188,0.4672,1.7871,0.5507,2.2744,2.1132,4.5582,1.9206,6.8789,3.2167,5.4585,0.3294,4.9344,4.0783,4.918,0.4402,4.9959,0.3035,1.6211,8.0751,5.7975,2.9064,10.5769,4.5662,2.2049,4.6498,1.762,6.9938,4.1147,0.5921,4.1806,2.6579,1.0064,6.0285,2.9137,11.877,0.7944,5.9385,3.0054,2.5576,0.904,0.4997,1.9747,2.9336,1.4904,2.2205,4.1341,5.0985,6.9241,4.3356,1.2761,2.8193,2.2309,4.9021,3.6996,5.0218,2.7702,1.0828,2.3363,0.4026,2.6482,0.8644,0.7579,0.6792,2.4591,3.2639,0.2706,0.2395,3.8061,5.9291,2.5621,9.6227,5.0017,8.3573,5.8114,3.8185,2.9694,4.4926,5.6446,6.5025,0.9067,1.7403,4.0711,3.3509,1.6187,0.713,0.2021,1.064,4.7429,6.9843,1.7288,2.6028,9.6042,0.3457,1.9598,0.0906,0.1518,1.2876,1.3749,2.788,0.8748,0.394,1.608,0.6041,1.1208,4.3189,0.2107,1.704,2.9644,6.6141,5.4576,1.4895,2.6564,1.2756,0.6002,3.598,3.0518,0.6232,0.4987,0.907,0.3591,4.657,0.1544,0.1415,3.4625,4.3914,2.7389,4.3466,4.6573,7.153,5.8128,1.1775,1.7201,3.5015,0.1249,3.8843,2.6972,5.185,1.6969,2.156,0.9331,0.9917,3.664,4.4718,0.674,0.9873,4.1496,0.6743,1.4606,5.4548,2.2573,4.3793,1.742,7.4661,3.717,0.7534,9.1984,10.1218,7.7888,0.495,5.5406,0.628,4.0762,0.5013,5.1893,0.6041,0.6692,0.7936,1.5637,0.1666,1.2529,0.1183,0.7398,6.0079,0.2367,1.4199,3.1525,4.9276,4.7799,2.0949,0.4038,0.3074,4.2935,0.4366,0.3884,0.3011,0.1555,0.5358,3.0109,0.1779,2.9281,3.4513,0.4693,7.836,1.6331,3.8585,3.0876,4.1481,1.2449,2.0608,4.0981,5.0817,0.8913,2.0861,0.3637,4.3362,2.4912,3.5131,1.3594,6.5241,2.5357,0.1385,5.3133,2.1926,0.0434,0.6648,0.1205,0.8247,1.184,2.5785,0.717,5.7893,1.0507,5.8467,2.8768,1.2465,2.7554,0.5054,5.8739,0.2712,1.9909,5.5451,3.6305,1.9859,6.7535,1.9115,1.5251,4.5347,1.1347,0.0603,3.504,1.69,6.3048,5.9321,0.0978,5.5525,1.6462,0.4072,4.3779,3.1105,4.1525,0.3768,0.0237,4.0859,6.1271,2.4804,2.3854,7.9215,2.8667,1.8495,3.8548,9.3605,10.7305,7.4664,2.7314,5.186,0.5052,5.2776,2.2108,0.1657,3.4977,3.982,4.2743,0.0159,0.0003,0.0,0.0149,0.8521,0.2605,2.4303,4.6531,1.0501,5.4044,0.0015,1.7956,4.7346,7.7987,0.6634,0.0044,2.2015,2.7814,0.2323,1.6593,0.25,1.3932,1.3989,2.6432,0.0023,4.2781,4.5883,2.9829,4.1335,2.944,0.3623,0.3577,3.932,2.3512,0.1465,2.3715,2.7177,0.1202,0.0168,8.0967,1.2966,0.4834,3.3686,1.9059,0.0002,0.1203,2.8205,1.8693,2.3524,6.0524,4.4335,1.8892,1.4171,4.2676,1.6198,0.6855,4.6361,0.0027,0.0016,2.8318,4.2622,7.4091,0.4451,1.405,6.5983,4.4898,0.7216,2.0686,6.2826,0.2522,0.0003,1.4781,0.769,0.0514,4.5368,4.7414,0.2556,1.4869,2.5168,3.1891,0.0008,2.286,4.9797,1.7321,4.9834,4.7932,7.0608,8.0981,1.5417,4.8434,3.093,3.6298,4.815,0.3179,0.5893,2.9254,4.1411,1.8992,3.0517,0.9208,0.0049,2.7153,1.9156,4.1952,4.1087,0.1335,0.0985,2.9003,0.5414,6.9984,0.0017,2.3097,2.3195,3.497,1.4719,7.182,0.5447,5.6753,5.7315,5.6645,4.8486,0.4459,0.0412,5.3131,1.2172,5.9193,1.8757,0.9788,0.9381,2.6352,4.2744,1.0384,3.8255,1.8583,2.4016,6.4101,1.639,1.6734,0.8431,1.1498,5.8178,3.7928,1.3413,2.6427,0.4992,1.4378,3.221,0.0833,0.0022,4.2791,1.9411,4.3107,0.1602,5.777,0.0065,4.3246,5.5039,0.6911,7.0726,5.6086,1.2035,0.4366,1.3455,2.4892,5.4059,0.6022,1.2984,0.2545,5.1615,1.6546,5.2372,1.05,4.695,4.7849,3.0481,4.8978,0.0438,0.0027,1.8716,3.4042,13.0538,0.3172,0.0085,3.098,4.8807,1.5869,6.3193,0.9787,1.2216,6.6639,1.0835]}
{"prompt":"A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2019 s home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure , police told","text":"A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2019 s home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure, police told CNN, the local CBS affiliate. A U.S. Forest Service official told CNN he thought the package was suspicious, but decided not to contact the law enforcement agencies after reviewing it. He didn't have an official response when reached by CNN.\nA group of scientists who study the Arctic warned Tuesday that the polar ice cap is shrinking rapidly at a faster pace than previously thought. A major reason for the rapid decrease is a reduction in clouds and precipitation that occurs every spring.\nStrawberries and raspberries are the two most cultivated berry varieties in the world. Researchers from China, Australia and the United States found that the berries, used in cooking, can reduce the risk of colon and other cancers. Scientists believe the chemical compounds found in strawberry skins can affect cancer-cell growth. Also the presence of polyphenols has been shown to reduce the risk of arthritis development.\nThe first step in growing strawberries and raspberries is to grow the mother plants. You harvest strawberries and raspberries from the mother plant, which is the main source of nutrition for the next generation of fruit.\nGrowing strawberries and raspberries has its own set of rules and you need to carefully follow the process to produce fruits in good condition. The plants are best grown outdoors or under greenhouse conditions.\nStrawberry varieties in the U.S. include American Beauty and Mondo Noir. American Beauty berries are large and have red skin color. It is suitable for large, mature plants. Mondo Noir berries are small and have red skin color. In this variety, berry skin is darker and a bit thicker while the flesh has less pulp.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture allows growing and using of strawberries and raspberries if a permit was granted. In some states, cultivation of the berries is not allowed.\nMadewell and Nordstrom's collaboration this year has certainly been full of some great stuff. My two favorite items were their spring styles and my most worn ones from Madewell and Nordstrom's last couple of runway collections.\nMy favorite street style looks have shown a wide variety of trends and styles in clothing. My favorite looks, however, have shown a love for bold colors and prints, classic patterns (e.g. florals and stripes, and plaid with or without accents like embroidery or tassels) and interesting patterns on the sleeves (like tie-dye and floral embroidery). A great fashion blog like StyleCraze has recently showcased many fun and inspiring runway trends for spring. What I find interesting is the inclusion of denim in these collections, which I have never seen so aggressively displayed in a fashion show.\nMany of the outfits that appeared in the shows have been inspired by the 80's. To add emphasis to this stylish vibe, clothes with a sporty, active look have recently begun to appear in women's fashion. For example, the skirts worn in the 2010 Versace show were similar to women's skirts worn for sports activities, such as rugby. Additionally, the embellished and patterned sleeves in the 2010 Prada and Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 spring collections reminded me of the tennis and golf clubs used during these events.","token_len":693,"entropy":[10.0349,3.9672,1.7793,0.0686,4.5263,7.3256,0.1408,6.3244,0.322,0.0361,0.0176,4.2253,0.2999,1.8102,0.0038,0.0,11.6838,6.6204,8.6346,6.8077,1.9846,3.733,8.9841,0.0307,5.1506,0.0586,3.9363,3.74,2.732,9.543,0.2111,0.8407,1.2147,6.6693,8.0253,8.8699,5.4887,0.1841,9.9653,0.9955,1.5129,4.7896,4.1244,1.9828,4.1694,3.5336,5.7507,2.8674,0.0609,2.8049,4.1301,4.7084,0.0019,0.0041,0.0015,6.0489,0.003,2.2028,1.1346,0.5162,4.0129,4.3104,0.6044,2.1749,0.6808,4.7808,1.7253,0.9149,6.076,1.4655,0.0012,5.496,1.1732,6.2598,0.0536,3.4789,4.1867,5.218,2.276,0.4514,4.1908,4.7918,0.1254,3.1628,2.9601,1.9692,2.5473,4.4001,2.5925,0.3579,0.4441,0.2398,0.6959,13.6783,5.3642,0.221,7.719,2.2804,3.1694,1.5486,8.273,6.9122,4.436,0.2695,1.1294,5.9039,1.7275,1.6546,1.2491,3.7996,2.9109,5.1738,1.0485,3.2681,2.0891,0.083,1.5162,0.2996,0.7132,4.0957,4.39,5.1613,0.9178,0.8337,3.6722,3.715,0.9269,2.455,3.7684,0.0693,7.6933,1.8718,4.5189,2.3856,3.9551,3.5885,5.2798,1.3169,0.8855,6.6258,5.629,0.9078,1.7565,4.4826,0.0173,0.0001,1.1284,2.3449,3.7445,1.578,6.673,8.8024,0.02,1.2756,0.7668,0.3233,0.6198,1.1215,5.1482,2.498,5.8902,1.7595,3.8543,0.6907,1.6549,0.8127,0.1822,3.3642,0.5053,1.7225,4.7014,3.2592,5.4266,1.1849,3.9892,0.871,3.918,3.5714,0.8863,2.8403,0.0663,5.9886,6.6825,3.7033,2.2913,1.4753,3.9959,2.9198,1.5169,7.5272,3.3953,2.3275,0.1041,5.6447,5.6859,2.0789,4.3971,3.5051,3.7233,5.3218,1.8321,1.0317,6.98,5.2605,7.4065,0.0342,5.6019,1.1365,0.0609,4.7411,0.353,1.925,0.2183,2.224,0.7141,0.4956,0.0448,7.0254,9.2702,0.9897,0.5305,1.7515,5.5014,4.399,1.0691,4.9321,1.451,2.56,0.5939,0.0008,0.0002,0.8413,0.7815,2.7819,2.4241,8.1537,1.4623,1.844,5.2391,5.3942,3.8651,1.5622,0.653,0.0022,0.0004,1.5466,1.3009,4.4694,1.3975,1.5823,1.5805,1.1725,2.6993,3.0602,1.5031,0.1653,3.7472,0.6212,0.4955,7.0079,0.7435,0.7152,3.5614,0.8087,2.0792,6.4235,1.3886,0.3473,0.0203,0.0016,0.0013,3.9272,3.9691,1.7585,2.7682,0.0057,3.6197,1.9662,7.0433,2.5069,0.2693,4.8571,2.196,1.5188,4.094,1.9516,3.6162,4.9916,4.1502,5.106,1.8682,0.2755,2.2053,4.411,1.5918,5.9054,2.1088,4.2418,2.995,3.1983,7.6856,0.8778,0.7051,1.2075,4.8946,0.0089,1.8786,4.7504,3.3968,1.07,1.7929,0.0011,0.0104,0.103,3.7998,4.6642,9.3173,2.7851,5.8961,7.4583,9.1734,1.4577,2.6601,0.0838,4.8991,0.664,6.4656,1.1399,2.8325,4.8526,6.142,4.3023,1.4687,3.8569,0.9534,7.0816,0.1336,4.8432,2.6879,3.5604,2.8582,1.4287,1.63,0.0015,0.3043,1.6953,0.5632,4.6346,0.6673,1.063,2.6221,0.5403,0.3653,0.1899,4.1919,4.1722,4.8921,0.6195,6.8797,0.0366,3.9933,0.8202,3.6686,1.2905,4.3497,3.01,3.0101,6.0746,2.3717,3.488,3.4341,3.1069,7.7068,0.6504,1.5004,1.8555,3.3557,0.001,0.0071,0.0044,1.1648,0.0009,0.0335,6.4794,4.8092,4.1594,5.3508,3.4774,2.0782,0.5281,0.0644,0.0014,0.001,5.8445,3.2587,2.9826,3.8654,2.3659,1.3649,3.4343,2.9964,1.4474,0.4108,7.971,0.9234,2.2006,0.6409,0.8641,2.8844,0.8105,0.9204,1.233,9.4189,7.917,0.0412,3.8115,8.9963,1.1831,2.2811,7.612,6.8758,0.7066,3.2422,9.4221,2.6947,8.7403,0.1152,5.8942,2.9735,5.0712,0.3656,7.0985,5.853,1.6337,4.0593,2.3761,4.2196,7.7559,7.4935,1.2958,3.3665,5.6735,8.7453,3.6474,5.3332,4.6261,0.0272,0.0043,1.1885,0.0582,0.0006,1.6491,5.6393,4.2034,0.5824,14.5087,8.2624,0.2835,1.2509,3.8392,1.2501,8.6656,1.9692,6.3294,7.4986,6.8697,5.1554,5.3016,1.1246,0.0683,5.0491,2.0324,2.8539,2.9744,5.9384,1.6084,3.2381,0.6297,5.6129,4.3842,2.6113,0.0135,2.0904,3.2983,1.2556,8.2595,0.8809,6.501,2.1709,0.8388,5.3834,2.363,6.8276,3.4929,5.6718,4.1655,0.0026,0.0009,1.1522,6.8662,1.1891,0.0872,1.8242,4.5807,2.6279,3.4914,6.2923,0.0814,5.0713,6.8295,0.1138,5.4333,4.7213,5.4621,0.4276,0.0363,2.6368,4.895,1.9969,0.4261,1.3719,0.2168,6.0795,2.0515,5.343,2.0113,5.1391,3.4628,2.5134,7.7035,1.0374,1.7976,0.1178,2.5864,5.0407,3.8579,0.1006,0.0203,0.5573,4.9851,3.025,4.8879,4.6352,5.6939,5.1349,9.464,5.2715,1.7672,4.7683,5.8139,3.6751,7.2523,1.6915,5.2747,7.2954,2.0343,2.9263,6.0661,1.1387,6.4374,2.3951,3.8319,2.234,0.8622,1.6462,7.3626,0.034,7.2687,2.298,3.4981,4.2496,1.7836,1.3178,2.5883,3.1466,3.102,0.6366,4.841,7.9043,4.3755,1.3646,2.3445,1.2973,4.075,0.6287,0.853,5.0681,0.9923,0.9104,5.2214,2.808,6.0549,0.8007,1.4923,5.016,2.7281,1.2387,2.3436,0.0715,1.9403,7.7365,1.4435,3.4452,6.1599,4.3689,7.4842,0.3122,1.5862,8.8345,6.7227,0.2895,7.4684,3.3682,2.8517,7.4846,1.078,2.1747,8.2354,1.5979,2.0178,4.8878,4.6109,0.5789,1.0667,1.0668,7.0854,0.0086,1.7443,1.1951,3.5945,0.3132,0.1623,2.4356,7.1897,2.6641,2.1173,1.1524,5.4388,8.5121,0.0115,3.5229,2.0105,6.5922,0.1234,5.5154,0.1453,2.1946,1.1014,3.9125,5.7103,4.7,1.857,2.2006,0.0016,5.9304,1.743,6.4607,0.1467,1.6925,10.6488,1.0412,3.9064,5.5894,0.0108,3.9605,2.2121,0.6744,3.2718,6.2771,0.2261,4.4028,9.8753,4.2584,0.0022,0.0368,3.6853,5.87,8.6392,0.7917,6.1371,0.0997,0.1709,1.4813,7.5324,3.1104,3.0015,4.4639,3.8486,3.4909,4.8261,2.4756,0.1283]}

According to an analysis of debt data from a number of central banks, the global debt to GDP ratio hit nearly 3.3 trillion US dollars, or about 300 trillion Thai baht (8.45 trillion US dollars), by the end of 2017, the paper cited as saying.\nA new study published by the World Bank on Tuesday said the debt accumulation that began in 2001 was largely the result of \u201cimproved growth rates since then\u201d. It blamed excessive borrowing by China, India and Brazil during that period. The analysis of debt figures showed that around 70 percent of total global debt came out of China and India as a share of their economies, and less than 15 percent came from the United States as a share of its economy, the paper cited as saying.\nThe research further noted that debt levels in many Asian countries had soared to the point where their economies were close to default in many cases. \u201cThe debt ratio is high \u2013 even in countries where their GDP growth rate has slowed,\u201d the paper quoted him as saying.\nJapan\u2019s leading lender \u2013 the Bank of Japan \u2013 has said it has enough capital to cover its debt levels for the next ten years. According to Reuters, the latest estimates released by the lender showed that its capital adequacy ratio had reached 12.6 percent, from 11.7 percent at the end of July.\nItaly\u2019s Economy Ministry said on Thursday it has approved a third loan tranche, worth around 8 billion euros, to help finance the government\u2019s deficit-cutting program. Its second tranche of the program was approved on Thursday, Reuters reported.\nThe third tranche has been approved as part of the government\u2019s financial flexibility package aimed at reducing Italy\u2019s budget deficit, which it plans to cut to 5.5 percent next year from 7.2 percent in 2015.\nThe package was the result of the negotiations between the finance ministry and the European Commission on a new rescue mechanism to be used, at a time when Italy is in danger of losing its Triple-A international rating. The package includes another 5 billion euros to be allocated by the European Union and the IMF.\nItaly is seeking EU and IMF support to bail out the struggling economy through the creation of a mechanism that it hopes will prevent it going down the same route as Greece and Portugal and which will mean it will lose its investment grade.\nThe euro zone\u2019s second-biggest economy posted a 0.2 per cent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in December on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. The quarterly reading was a surprise, with analysts expecting a 0.1 per cent gain. The figures were published by the Office of National Statistics this afternoon.","token_len":694,"entropy":[7.8686,10.0035,8.9994,1.9035,1.9062,0.0426,0.1476,0.0013,5.3337,1.8056,2.259,5.0022,2.2332,1.9329,4.6838,0.0782,5.2536,5.677,4.729,4.6237,1.2466,10.2086,4.9844,0.0059,1.9672,7.9124,6.0752,2.7898,0.3025,2.7659,2.9584,0.2968,11.1442,1.4333,6.4264,6.9358,2.2314,1.7524,4.6212,1.0458,2.7146,3.1819,6.8278,0.1632,1.5919,0.1707,0.2379,0.2754,15.4364,6.9632,0.0104,0.0003,3.7034,6.4327,3.7068,7.8916,1.985,8.6292,9.4598,7.8318,7.7716,6.7061,2.5127,1.8735,2.7418,1.2247,2.0812,1.4666,2.2622,1.9039,2.9627,5.001,5.2007,0.0562,5.5042,4.5332,6.4348,2.1329,0.0106,0.7509,0.1765,5.4302,4.3457,2.154,0.9493,3.5258,0.994,1.2126,0.2526,5.6281,6.3281,2.6924,3.9049,8.0626,5.3857,2.6207,0.963,1.4055,0.4111,2.4307,0.5262,3.0979,2.3354,0.073,4.4905,0.118,2.4086,0.0147,4.9651,1.1043,2.7472,3.8241,7.0045,0.0086,0.0012,1.6406,0.2682,0.1516,2.2189,3.5592,1.6291,4.2071,6.2183,0.0557,0.0009,1.5586,3.0838,14.2491,5.8966,10.4357,0.4708,2.7014,7.7282,0.0583,5.3465,7.6276,4.6727,5.4208,0.0048,4.4972,1.9523,1.5657,4.4842,2.8967,1.4538,4.6803,2.4959,0.002,3.6704,0.0936,0.8597,1.2418,2.1571,0.3818,0.5367,0.5552,0.0417,5.7866,4.8381,3.7362,1.3716,2.578,3.8152,3.0483,0.0343,2.9763,1.5806,2.2316,7.7797,2.9172,9.6749,1.4949,0.0123,0.0077,2.996,6.7618,0.5741,5.7848,0.8449,1.1291,0.2225,1.8098,3.1472,1.5565,0.1687,0.0038,2.961,0.8762,1.9271,1.9787,5.113,4.1128,4.923,0.1219,0.2393,4.3601,3.9637,2.8939,2.509,1.4935,0.7985,3.2699,0.1041,3.1253,1.9497,2.0997,1.5627,2.8415,8.3246,5.4563,3.1045,0.3959,4.1564,1.5823,6.1408,3.6598,0.1315,0.0033,15.7294,0.2518,6.4327,0.4502,4.1074,2.5311,5.3623,0.5999,1.1764,2.6387,1.7981,3.3795,5.3332,5.1745,3.3958,2.2107,3.9337,0.9861,1.3807,0.7265,1.5795,5.3495,2.3482,0.6169,2.325,2.8826,5.4173,3.3385,1.441,4.5709,3.84,0.5864,5.2325,3.8055,0.9671,0.0355,3.8206,1.6141,0.7517,4.754,5.4722,0.1442,2.1769,2.05,2.3999,3.668,1.3091,2.3195,0.0257,4.4818,4.043,1.3144,2.4974,4.7947,0.0372,3.423,0.0187,1.43,0.5849,1.4702,1.3079,0.0157,4.1737,0.0614,0.0487,0.371,3.8557,2.6545,1.9926,1.1343,2.1262,3.9145,0.5724,0.2677,0.0371,0.1772,1.5291,5.5004,6.347,2.8179,0.1477,3.5655,2.5743,1.7487,3.6315,3.1227,0.7504,3.2988,4.8107,2.5081,2.984,1.0339,0.699,3.6785,1.292,0.8006,5.8982,0.0582,4.6216,3.6371,3.8839,1.3082,0.8271,9.639,0.2762,2.0202,3.4664,4.1278,2.3969,4.7302,7.0374,4.3813,2.0827,1.7573,1.5229,5.3549,2.8727,2.7648,1.9013,1.7684,2.4182,2.2103,3.3856,3.5752,1.7177,1.0726,3.6477,4.7973,0.0826,0.0551,0.1351,0.2808,6.3742,6.486,6.3768,3.5269,6.9858,4.2634,6.9779,2.7292,1.7541,0.1005,0.0412,0.8388,1.8507,2.5837,0.7681,2.8882,5.7894,3.9625,0.3259,2.6689,1.3599,1.5388,3.2562,2.8591,1.0711,0.9174,4.6153,0.0369,1.1342,5.4396,0.0027,3.6061,0.364,1.1393,5.2347,3.7413,4.0914,0.3962,0.6494,4.1853,2.769,0.8126,2.501,3.0267,4.5662,0.0121,2.8877,2.7543,1.2027,5.7192,0.3636,2.337,0.4967,1.402,5.3021,2.9679,0.1577,2.0841,0.0386,2.9645,0.3087,0.3177,0.0013,3.9773,1.0448,0.4761,7.955,1.4853,1.018,0.0859,6.4717,2.8,1.0901,1.5434,2.3007,1.4634,3.6468,4.6833,1.4146,6.6693,3.7198,10.6231,0.0124,3.2627,2.8535,3.5647,4.8104,1.321,0.3863,0.7113,1.0691,2.7392,2.6042,1.2098,2.7448,7.3708,1.168,0.0535,5.0784,2.8065,4.2292,2.5464,0.8313,5.652,4.7546,0.9246,0.0001,2.954,3.0979,2.3022,2.613,0.9012,1.5469,1.8697,1.3145,5.6241,0.2837,0.4297,0.3844,1.6261,4.9855,0.3134,0.0001,3.9003,0.8808,0.6016,4.2457,0.719,0.0012,1.1214,2.2751,3.4304,0.1436,0.0189,4.8785,7.6874,1.2845,5.3811,0.0335,1.6048,5.6638,0.9022,0.0191,0.0068,3.6163,0.1811,2.1178,2.7026,3.6696,4.6695,0.0161,2.2927,1.9392,3.08,0.6964,1.4344,0.1243,4.2086,0.1496,2.2087,2.2059,0.434,2.54,0.0111,1.255,2.0635,0.5828,0.5847,1.5431,7.331,3.0252,4.8031,1.6044,0.0044,2.2089,5.1454,0.6946,0.7307,4.5388,0.7492,0.2079,0.7105,2.8723,1.9833,2.3878,2.3891,2.8345,7.2101,3.7337,2.3835,3.3968,2.8705,5.6943,6.8539,0.9249,0.4894,0.1192,1.9294,1.1222,3.2222,4.9926,0.0869,2.3014,0.8241,11.6307,3.1571,0.0291,7.2308,1.3841,1.2644,1.7805,5.183,3.176,6.1539,4.1033,1.916,0.1661,1.7636,1.7105,3.6651,2.9147,0.6741,0.9746,2.1486,2.227,1.5164,1.494,1.9003,0.4721,3.1636,2.0697,4.1505,5.8401,4.1273,0.2563,1.7905,0.6944,6.3607,0.641,1.3925,4.9128,2.2592,3.3759,2.6378,3.374,0.0137,0.8767,5.3286,2.6818,4.412,2.0306,0.4925,4.1049,1.4516,5.774,5.0708,1.1439,1.1064,1.9272,0.9922,1.8651,1.5524,1.6202,3.4468,5.4437,3.2292,4.4242,3.3005,1.224,3.5519,1.1228,6.4435,3.6414,2.1276,0.5475,1.5598,4.5707,1.0623,5.135,0.1407,0.0359,4.0469,1.5275,1.3355,0.0004,1.2275,6.2344,1.0206,3.8335,0.0065,2.8428,4.749,0.0015,2.8996,0.1068,2.5882,0.0539,0.0026,1.9028,0.0065,0.0012,0.1297,0.783,3.3599,5.6644,0.8328,3.6075,0.0035,0.0149,6.8781,0.7286,1.4052,1.6762,5.9532,5.9672,1.6572,3.2925,6.2192,1.8455,2.6229,5.1801,1.9268,1.9569,1.6404,0.0028,1.9501,0.1869,0.0001,2.8831,1.3717,2.3038,5.3347,1.605,4.5763,1.8985,0.9866,3.5211,0.6753,5.0165,0.0255,5.7958,2.3207,0.4865]}
{"prompt":"U.S . Senator Dick Durbin , the No . 2 Democrat in the Senate , said on Wednesday that fellow Democrat Al Franken should resign in light of sexual misconduct allegations against him . \u201c","text":"U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said on Wednesday that fellow Democrat Al Franken should resign in light of sexual misconduct allegations against him. \u201c Al Franken is a senator and somebody you should trust and somebody you should believe in and I think it\u2019s outrageous that he would ever be allowed to sit in this chamber and I think it\u2019s a little bit unhinged that people are even thinking about this, \u201dDurbin said in an interview at CNN headquarters in New York. \u201c Even if there\u2019s a very serious allegation, if he gets convicted on the charges, he knows that no senator should ever sit in that chamber so he needs to resign, but he needs to resign before he goes to trial. \u201d The Democratic senator went on to criticize the FBI for not arresting or bringing charges against Durbin after sexual harassment allegations were made against him by a female staffer in his Minnesota office. \u201c I think it was a bit of an indication of the FBI when we asked and the Justice Department when we asked whether there was any indication they were going to take the allegations seriously, \u201d Durbin said. \u201cI think it was pretty obvious then that if they were serious about this, if he\u2019s guilty of something, he\u2019d be arrested and if he didn\u2019t have access to the Justice Department, I mean, obviously they didn\u2019t, he would have been arrested and his records would have been sealed. \u201d Senator Durbin and Franken have clashed on Capitol Hill over issues ranging from the war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war and the health care law. The Wisconsin Republican said he was not surprised to learn of a complaint against Franken after seeing the woman\u2019s allegations, which were leaked over the weekend by two sources. The Wisconsin man told police that he approached Franken during an August 9 meeting to ask for a job. Durbin said he believes that Franken was not involved in the complaint at the time of the meeting, nor when he discussed it with her later that evening. The complaint also alleged that Franken allegedly pursued Franken on multiple occasions. Durbin, a critic of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, said he supports repealing the law. Durbin said he was not surprised to learn of the alleged sexual misconduct against Franken, but said he was appalled that it happened. \u201c He\u2019s a senator and I don\u2019t believe it, \u201d Durbin said. \u201c I just can\u2019t believe it. \u201d Sen. Franken acknowledged receiving two sexual harassment complaints against him. He said Friday that he had responded to the accusations, including that the \u201c one woman who told me this... called me the worst name that I could possibly think of. \u201d \u201c Yes, I believe I did what I am charged with, I believe I was a little more than a little bit aggressive, \u201d he said. \u201c I mean, I felt like I was being honest, I felt like I was trying to do the right thing. \u201d In statements released Tuesday, a Republican-appointed attorney for Franken and a member of lawmakers\u2019 ethics commissions said they believe he will be acquitted of the charges, though not necessarily of all of them. Franken has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and said he would resign if convicted.","token_len":695,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,5.6968,0.1165,0.0,0.0,1.449,2.9817,3.8104,0.0025,0.4501,0.5806,0.3836,0.1298,0.3584,0.3864,1.4215,2.8423,2.4576,0.6799,9.2673,2.5375,4.5183,0.0175,3.1464,1.1669,4.1536,3.4938,0.0025,3.4686,0.3807,0.1302,1.4118,0.3333,0.465,13.4261,8.5071,9.1659,0.0281,2.4898,1.7013,4.9114,2.6321,7.6172,4.9844,0.6955,3.2744,3.0386,7.9052,0.9051,0.1948,4.9966,0.8454,3.0065,2.8001,1.0389,2.7632,14.7878,6.8068,3.9822,5.7083,0.9036,1.0482,1.9375,5.2199,2.9391,3.8054,0.1072,3.0524,1.0722,2.0057,3.197,1.5307,4.9539,0.7477,1.0515,3.167,0.0252,0.0213,3.2401,4.4861,1.4374,5.4929,4.3843,0.0189,2.362,4.4847,1.5668,4.6581,3.7431,0.6903,1.8458,2.8399,4.7355,6.8892,7.6789,1.5966,0.0002,2.5064,2.6677,1.062,0.1709,4.5384,6.4911,4.846,2.2648,0.8722,0.0434,0.4158,1.3011,0.7815,6.4222,1.6899,2.9442,6.2928,0.6417,0.0529,1.5716,5.579,2.2902,0.9672,1.1052,3.2414,3.1515,4.5737,5.1853,3.8093,2.846,1.6428,1.0526,1.7459,6.3357,1.2979,5.7091,7.5321,2.4073,0.5416,1.8364,0.2593,2.5473,0.4149,6.7192,1.6134,4.0351,0.0414,1.1179,2.4201,3.3389,1.9247,2.0845,0.0475,1.6596,4.6666,1.0657,3.497,0.7706,3.0945,1.047,1.2016,2.3441,5.1598,4.7902,3.0462,6.2127,0.8095,0.5241,4.6981,1.5756,4.9283,1.644,1.1807,5.9674,2.9748,6.141,0.3191,0.3187,5.9457,0.1476,0.0002,4.2598,5.5885,2.2946,0.2697,1.9767,0.5309,0.4846,0.1348,3.0312,2.1137,2.7585,1.5308,2.6011,2.6533,7.176,0.5285,0.5688,1.613,0.722,3.0065,0.9409,1.6423,3.3879,1.7976,3.7059,1.3681,1.8215,6.3339,1.6229,2.0029,5.6516,7.0016,5.5162,4.8265,5.9662,3.1285,4.3977,0.0089,3.6482,1.3775,0.5783,3.7745,2.5062,0.6444,1.1689,4.1831,3.2432,0.7628,1.3641,0.0681,3.4678,2.978,3.4142,1.9683,1.7675,1.2778,0.5435,2.921,0.0004,0.0006,0.253,0.8016,0.5522,0.7053,6.529,0.4636,1.1611,1.2543,4.3515,2.5301,5.1911,0.9229,3.2477,1.7767,1.9108,3.2061,1.8944,2.591,0.8584,4.0883,3.922,5.8712,1.1906,0.112,2.7066,1.3549,3.0048,0.8035,2.0815,2.4177,0.0097,4.2347,1.1773,4.5837,1.2438,4.5862,0.8713,5.4053,1.2739,0.1194,1.3484,3.6748,5.6358,0.0428,1.3828,3.3307,0.0115,1.1656,2.8832,3.5434,0.766,6.1641,2.9418,3.7111,0.4686,0.1295,0.0815,4.4751,5.1002,2.4436,1.8978,1.5682,1.6291,1.2218,4.256,5.654,0.3322,0.49,0.2418,3.3006,0.8407,1.0027,0.4553,5.9582,1.1307,0.001,0.0002,4.6288,5.2704,2.325,7.8664,2.2326,4.2144,0.0012,1.6151,3.5854,1.671,0.0044,1.9306,5.2368,1.0614,1.1134,3.1886,1.6341,2.7765,0.5984,1.2646,1.1688,5.0749,0.1253,1.244,0.7978,2.8661,5.7594,2.2977,2.0894,1.6101,2.223,2.9271,2.0587,2.9432,1.4804,1.71,3.4282,4.8946,2.4755,1.1792,3.7122,5.7838,1.7025,5.3731,8.3098,0.4737,0.2866,3.7057,2.9711,2.665,1.9965,6.7884,6.1687,0.3224,0.8674,2.5571,4.398,4.2323,1.8243,2.3959,2.7934,6.0006,3.2904,7.2781,1.0911,1.0175,6.7727,0.7586,3.7902,2.1123,4.8745,4.1499,2.1732,2.6641,2.4642,1.8698,1.7482,4.1565,1.7235,4.7063,0.0118,0.0004,0.8831,1.2621,4.8787,1.7274,1.556,2.1663,2.7254,3.5533,0.3579,0.6099,5.0183,3.6651,0.9506,0.0304,2.3562,0.2733,1.4357,1.3555,5.8354,6.5055,1.17,6.2491,0.9563,0.2979,4.5101,6.3715,0.7836,3.1819,0.2268,2.0702,4.9916,3.0287,2.2182,0.1885,0.4536,4.3848,6.2051,5.4035,3.2931,2.5575,0.1967,2.4789,2.454,0.0023,0.0006,3.8423,1.93,7.7798,0.019,2.0659,1.1322,0.0023,5.0407,0.1696,0.117,1.8798,0.0433,0.2,0.2179,1.113,1.4294,5.34,6.1646,0.6395,1.9635,2.1658,3.7523,0.0101,0.0006,1.0485,0.9575,2.68,2.1515,1.0939,1.4111,0.4693,0.8665,0.6832,3.7231,1.8932,0.6444,3.1365,0.2506,1.4199,1.0865,1.9905,0.5406,1.8125,4.7226,1.9362,3.0429,2.143,0.7248,3.1217,0.906,2.2274,2.2545,0.0405,0.9036,1.6358,2.8183,0.6147,2.073,3.0294,0.4425,0.5759,0.022,2.6018,2.4628,3.0053,2.1553,0.1827,2.4351,0.0006,0.0007,0.2672,0.2388,0.6463,0.6162,0.9177,4.3108,4.5954,1.7059,0.8557,0.0021,1.6513,1.4522,1.0243,1.7826,0.2242,5.1269,0.0805,0.4222,7.9774,7.2868,5.2877,2.7459,2.5538,0.9827,1.5302,0.0599,2.2922,1.1141,0.754,7.293,0.5951,0.3627,2.9024,6.2193,0.2427,1.069,3.313,2.5925,3.7614,2.9267,2.5029,13.8538,2.9544,7.3107,2.9615,1.9941,3.6672,5.0146,4.3433,9.0735,7.4953,1.2379,4.0296,3.1475,4.3548,3.2455,1.0708,1.805,3.1523,2.8462,0.0946,0.9402,1.3883,0.3829,3.5382,1.2364,6.2458,0.3134,1.0828,3.7652,2.8797,1.0537,5.2722,0.4591,6.9056,4.7216,0.4649,2.0062,1.9865,2.6125,0.5078,2.6794,2.7418,3.0715,4.7497,2.6183,1.7361,0.1998,0.7867,5.8252,1.7524,1.7569,0.0817,2.0385,1.1382,0.2328,0.4986,2.202,0.9449,3.4424,0.2024,0.8167,4.6427,1.7281,0.9449,0.8023,2.2628,6.008,1.9897,0.9494,0.6018,0.229,0.3512,0.3474,3.6084,0.0438,2.8743,1.2185,0.0854,0.0162,1.0427,0.9659,0.0742,4.4837,9.1382,2.9526,3.8765,0.4692,5.0121,4.4665,4.5862,2.3537,2.8583,1.1487,0.7458,4.16,2.0719,3.4019,0.0012,8.6071,5.7932,0.2637,12.673,7.7459,0.7971,1.5874,2.878,2.864,4.3214,1.3247,4.5931,0.8445,1.8575,0.6211,2.748,2.8715,4.7808,3.6156,2.0668,3.4454,1.435,0.6301,0.1433,3.5792,2.051,2.0507,2.1188,1.3074,1.1912,0.8503,0.3888,2.7277,1.6532,0.7274,2.3098,3.2269,1.1434,0.9882,0.6275]}

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release of the nearly 1,000-page document about a top Secret U.S. intelligence estimate saying Lee Harvey Oswald had almost certainly assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy, CNN reported.\nThe FBI and the CIA were reportedly worried that their assessments of how well intelligence on a possible assassin was coming and how closely to the crime was related could be used against them.\nAttorney William Patton, who has been fighting to win access to those documents for more than five years, said he would seek to argue that Trump's order to release the documents could harm the U.S. intelligence system.\n\"I think it's a case where there's some serious questions about whether these documents will be revealed,\" he told CNN.\nThe president directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review the executive order and said \"there's nothing that prohibits the Attorney General from releasing these documents \u2014 and, if that's appropriate \u2014 releasing them.\"\nThe order that Mr. Trump issued on Thursday directed the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the National Security Archive to begin making the 2,800 documents available for the public without first getting the FBI and the CIA permission. Two U.S. senators have asked for the documents to be made public, according to CNN.\nBut the FBI and the CIA said the release of those documents could put their work at risk. CNN reported on Friday that the two agencies said they would file lawsuits if the documents made it out.\nWhen CNN spoke with Attorney Patton, he said he was \"not sure,\" whether or not Mr. Trump's order would help get the documents released but that \"a lot\" of people in his circle of contacts believed the executive order was the right thing to do.\n\"I haven't had a conversation with anyone in the administration about it yet,\" he told CNN. \"I just talked to attorneys and others in law and politics who have shared their confidence that this is the appropriate course of action.\"\nPresidential adviser Kellyanne Conway has said she supported the President's executive order. The order, on the White House official website, noted President Donald Trump's administration \"has been working hard to review this case and determine whether or not to release these documents.\"\nThe Order also said the Attorney General would review the \"extent to which documents related to this case could be released without affecting the secrecy of the process.\" The order, on the White House homepage, called for the documents released by the executive order to be considered to be \"civilian records.\"\nNARA spokesperson Kristin Kelley said Friday the agency has been working with the President's Office of Management and Budget to assess how the release of the documents could affect NARA's operations. She said NARA will release the documents as soon as possible after receiving clearance from the Attorney General.\nEarlier in the week when Trump ordered the release of the documents, the FBI and the CIA issued opposing statements. A spokesperson from the FBI said she does not know how to respond to a request for information about the 2,800 documents regarding President John F. Kennedy's assassination, while the CIA spokesperson said the agency was unaware the documents had been ordered to be released.

The legislation , if agreed by the","text":"Polish lawmakers approved an overhaul of the judiciary on Friday, giving parliament de facto control over the selection of judges in defiance of the European Union. The legislation, if agreed by the government and signed by Poland's president Andrzej Duda, is highly unlikely to be enforced or effective in the near term. The bill allows parliament to choose justices in the Supreme and Constitutional Courts before they are appointed by the President to their appointed positions.\nThe president told parliament on Friday that he would sign the bill after a public campaign about legal changes. In a news conference on Friday, Duda said he supported a campaign for better, \" modern and transparent selection of judges. \" He said on Wednesday that he hoped to sign the bill soon after it became law.\nThe president's office said the bill would \" improve the judicial system and increase the powers of the president to intervene in the nomination process for judges and their promotion.'The proposed constitutional changes would give lawmakers direct control over judicial appointments as well as the powers to decide which institutions to appoint judges to.\nThe Polish government has said the proposal would ensure greater transparency and more effective separation of powers. But lawmakers have argued that the proposed reforms to the judiciary could bring back the old system, in which the president was the ultimate authority in the selection of judges and was able to nominate justices to all courts and magistrates offices.\nThe president defended the proposed bill by saying that it was a simple fix. \" In the past there were many cases where politicians used to influence appointments,'he said, adding,'As the head of state, I also have the right to select my own cabinet.'He said the bill would ensure greater accountability in the judiciary and better protection of the public rights to a fair trial by judges. \" I don't like the power to be absolute, but this was the only way to achieve such transparency and accountability,'he said.\n\" I hope in 10 days everyone will support this law, \" Duda said in his news conference. \" I have worked for transparency for a long time. '\nThe lawmakers also want to review the judicial elections that are conducted every five years and replace them with an open, democratic vote in which the public can choose its judges. The idea was presented by the legislature in March, but the government backed the idea later in the year.\nIn late May, Polish elections lawmakers proposed that every three years all the judges in active roles -- justices in courts and magistrates offices -- would be elected by open, general vote with an expanded vote for women and minorities.\nThe plan was to begin in 2021 and last for three years with a one-year break. The proposal has not been supported by the government's conservative lawmaking bloc, whose leader and former vice president, Jaroslaw Gowin, has been strongly critical of the idea.\nGowin has said in the past year he would back the proposal only if the vote was held in a special assembly, not as part of this year's regular legislative elections.\nThe proposed amendment was part of a bill that was drafted during elections in the late spring and also gives election results the ability to block judges from acting in their active offices for up to two years. In practice, this would likely mean a lower percentage of judges would be from parties that lost elections in recent years. The bill would also introduce automatic immunity from civil suits against judges for a period of five years after they are promoted to the top judicial posts.","token_len":698,"entropy":[6.6207,7.4177,5.615,2.9471,4.8387,0.2151,0.5889,6.4199,2.6978,2.2015,0.7504,4.3505,4.7938,10.3234,0.1375,1.3694,0.4363,0.6915,5.6168,0.3573,0.5197,3.7398,10.5029,0.0022,1.4917,2.9213,0.5606,1.7462,2.9133,4.1799,1.7521,4.8823,5.8282,1.3601,1.0854,3.1587,2.2152,1.3985,0.5792,4.6168,0.5186,2.5016,9.6295,0.0094,0.0002,0.0001,0.0053,0.0,0.162,2.6928,6.5508,2.1479,0.0195,1.7913,6.171,4.6926,6.7809,2.2562,1.0135,2.7528,1.8976,0.3715,2.992,3.7538,5.0458,3.3659,0.1159,3.447,6.368,3.0671,2.1502,4.0765,9.862,4.1924,2.3941,6.1343,2.8229,1.0237,2.3315,1.3815,0.4433,2.7698,5.0609,4.1475,6.05,1.3114,0.492,1.0926,13.7066,4.7406,4.7839,2.1966,2.0729,0.4416,0.2555,1.3768,1.6976,2.9618,0.3762,0.5652,3.1939,2.2648,4.9868,5.5708,6.9843,6.1343,2.928,1.7123,4.2997,1.2733,5.0477,0.0645,1.9167,0.641,0.2283,1.3631,0.0007,0.7088,1.3154,5.0364,2.9544,6.4199,3.4968,4.5908,5.895,3.4037,14.8379,2.6652,3.6124,8.027,0.9202,0.4659,3.465,1.9599,3.5438,1.1704,6.6857,3.5717,0.4316,1.2526,3.7497,1.2196,2.0436,0.2489,0.3945,4.0406,1.8452,3.9144,3.2036,0.2203,0.4561,0.6346,1.4913,3.3483,1.8199,2.8431,1.2,1.7192,2.1007,1.4033,3.6938,10.4283,0.779,2.2521,0.3815,1.5948,4.2346,1.1787,4.6972,0.1241,0.4717,2.1397,1.8889,6.2162,0.5046,1.3236,7.1756,2.6373,3.2392,1.2039,2.486,4.4905,5.2085,11.2645,6.4225,4.641,3.8068,1.9773,1.9796,3.3343,5.1321,4.4383,1.3454,0.1372,3.3409,1.3465,4.5801,0.2369,0.0249,1.0446,5.5295,0.4997,3.9815,3.0798,6.2932,1.1178,1.1073,1.8192,0.648,1.4653,1.8465,1.4594,3.6379,1.4269,1.359,2.7206,1.915,3.7896,1.2206,4.9186,4.4862,1.106,1.3878,4.0116,2.0204,8.6309,0.2152,0.2064,1.4437,3.5158,4.8148,1.6124,3.8407,0.2752,0.9991,2.779,1.9318,4.8871,0.2904,0.6406,2.5406,5.2639,4.352,1.9908,3.2313,1.1673,2.0126,3.6114,0.1713,1.4291,1.251,2.0878,2.1943,6.1322,3.8319,2.3932,1.521,1.5865,0.3267,0.6081,2.2004,4.4917,3.6036,0.0307,5.9809,5.0693,2.7728,4.5921,3.5546,3.072,6.5718,0.0459,5.9457,0.5252,0.7159,1.3361,2.5028,6.5824,0.5021,2.4369,5.389,3.7782,0.3553,1.3365,1.1202,2.0748,2.2418,4.9198,4.2701,3.408,0.6652,11.1935,1.3725,1.3786,3.2046,1.592,2.6543,3.459,0.865,5.8556,3.617,2.4281,7.2987,6.6391,8.4062,8.2903,0.1064,1.9323,0.9443,12.2935,6.2887,2.266,6.4431,0.0199,2.621,0.6799,1.0248,5.7277,0.9204,0.6941,1.9443,0.0518,4.0896,3.7851,1.8797,7.215,2.3314,4.7463,0.9765,1.427,2.327,0.9063,3.2141,3.2072,3.2256,2.425,0.578,2.4858,1.1822,4.4519,4.3978,0.3827,1.0053,2.8088,5.7075,3.3083,3.9606,0.4285,0.5985,3.4326,2.5963,1.1577,1.3292,3.9541,4.5023,0.0007,3.9765,1.28,7.8721,1.716,4.6304,7.2375,1.4668,1.0258,3.3039,4.2348,2.5224,3.0233,0.6537,0.622,3.8893,5.6329,4.7167,1.0095,1.7782,4.8144,2.9237,0.2638,0.257,0.8046,3.9871,2.6719,2.5488,5.4087,7.5079,3.5611,6.4025,0.9789,3.8095,0.9195,3.7512,2.0715,7.2593,2.6104,0.0007,0.4248,2.4562,2.2175,1.3566,0.0085,0.416,1.8122,1.9604,3.3321,4.562,2.2891,8.5137,2.0931,2.4691,0.1871,0.0309,1.6114,5.1786,2.6432,1.6764,6.8785,2.2626,5.0298,0.654,6.0014,0.5877,4.542,6.9102,2.3357,1.5947,4.2789,2.1103,1.987,0.0396,2.6188,3.878,1.0216,0.055,3.0166,2.0834,2.0003,2.316,3.413,3.1512,1.935,1.4392,3.233,0.9994,2.0617,3.3821,1.1928,0.4808,1.5662,4.9494,2.6071,4.8893,1.3852,1.6284,7.6138,1.639,2.9646,1.6813,1.7746,1.5109,2.5442,6.0937,2.6143,1.1705,4.4049,1.8695,0.4882,0.5362,0.549,0.8389,3.3001,4.2935,2.5143,0.1369,3.1671,4.9051,6.7494,3.9182,2.7924,5.8822,3.0037,0.4819,6.1722,2.4918,0.7359,2.0602,9.9826,4.3063,7.5724,5.7859,2.5209,5.6334,1.6185,1.1729,0.0099,2.5596,0.1805,1.3448,0.4113,2.2499,1.1158,5.9477,1.5687,6.0458,5.0407,5.2103,2.941,7.3362,3.0137,2.1697,4.3763,1.3982,1.1872,0.291,1.3764,1.393,4.3235,1.141,3.9205,6.3002,2.0468,7.1129,1.7481,2.7507,1.6679,2.3678,0.232,4.6723,1.2944,4.4133,0.1827,0.6871,3.5209,1.2616,1.488,2.6826,2.8776,2.2642,0.6581,4.8721,0.1311,0.7679,2.1676,4.6033,3.2269,6.9902,4.0274,1.7026,0.9506,4.9889,2.6055,3.739,2.5066,4.5118,0.3875,0.8159,2.8686,0.0016,0.0506,16.2877,4.0961,0.3971,1.4212,2.4669,5.7769,1.0458,0.0203,0.2138,2.2452,0.1702,0.6659,4.507,0.0226,0.0006,1.5875,1.6561,3.1758,0.9878,0.025,7.0734,3.0713,1.4997,4.789,0.5978,1.3588,3.7812,0.4049,1.5132,4.5623,1.0422,2.5508,1.1419,1.5877,3.4199,2.6839,1.9451,3.688,3.2068,3.287,0.0009,7.6657,1.3609,0.0052,4.6537,1.6547,3.9184,0.2343,0.8716,1.4799,4.0212,3.9628,2.7649,5.406,0.0012,0.5121,3.3102,1.8974,1.3293,4.0065,4.1502,6.3089,1.443,2.4364,3.4195,2.7045,1.0322,6.1673,7.7426,8.3299,5.8472,5.9153,3.7152,0.0115,7.2355,4.4123,1.0291,5.372,1.4895,1.8378,9.8073,6.5675,3.3037,2.4806,0.001,1.73,0.0678,0.3279,3.8205,4.8027,0.0859,2.4573,1.7763,4.8972,1.7567,2.5279,4.5089,3.0162,0.0767,0.7973,1.9782,0.5253,6.8405,6.518,1.1245,6.7803,2.8055,1.5747,2.4851,0.127,0.4145,2.6277,2.1968,1.6662,0.6077,5.5542,5.799,5.7598,1.6587,4.3911,1.9352,2.7793,0.4149,2.7085,4.9041,1.2792,0.2129,2.2103,0.0272,2.5621,1.5366,1.3907,5.9392,0.6324,1.6748,2.9317,3.2185,2.0042,0.3999]}
{"prompt":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation , on Friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation \u2019 s leading law enforcement agency , which has been under attack","text":"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation \u2019 s leading law enforcement agency, which has been under attack from progressive activists for months over Trump \u2019 s decision to remove FBI Director James Comey.\nBy saying he wanted more information and better coordination between federal investigators into a Russia probe in Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign and then-Attorney General Lynch and Comey, Sessions \u2019 statement, to be posted to Sessions \u2019 official Twitter account, underscored how his words and actions have been a mixed bag on the Russia investigation.\n\u201cPresident Trump has rightly called out the FBI Director and has requested additional information and coordination between FBI and (his) Justice Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe recognize this and stand ready to do what is important to ensure that Trump \u2019 s administration achieves its objectives.\u201d\nWhile Mr. Sessions\u2019 statement wasn\u2019t particularly surprising, it was unclear whether it would be enough to curb criticism amid a surge in opposition to the administration\u2019s Russia probe and more damning revelations about President Trump \u2019 s behavior.\nEarlier this week, Sen. Josh Hawley ( R-MN ) introduced legislation to block Trump Administration officials \u2014 including Department of Justice attorney general Jeff Sessions \u2014 from releasing their intelligence reports on Russia.\nHawley also is expected to vote today against Supreme Court nominations put forward by President Trump.\nHe added that his \u201cdisagreements with Attorney General Sessions are not so extreme as to call into question the legitimacy of his appointments as a U.S. attorney,\u201d which he said served as his \u201cfirst elected position.\u201d\nHe previously told a Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee that he believed Sessions was \u201cdoing everything he can or should be able to do\u201d.\nBut the attorney general\u2019s comments Wednesday were part of President Trump\u2019s decision last month to reverse his earlier backing of Comey and allow him to resign amid multiple reports of mishandling classified information. Trump has also cited other problems with the FBI\u2019s work on the Russia investigation, but has continued to support the agency.\nThe controversy over whether Sessions will be reappointed as attorney general once Trump takes office on Jan. 20 raised questions about how closely Sessions will follow Trump, who has said a number of times that he doesn\u2019t trust the FBI to investigate him and that the special counsel\u2019s report will exonerate him.\nThe U.S. Attorney General in 2010. He has been a vocal critic of Trump throughout his tenure, calling for the President to leave Twitter and questioning the authenticity of his emails, a pattern of criticism that began as Trump\u2019s campaign manager. He also has criticized Trump\u2019s decision to order the military to block travelers from Syria from entering the U.S., suggesting that it would be up to the Supreme Court to decide if the executive order constituted arbitrary and illegal federal action.\nSessions will appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee March 24 on Capitol Hill.\nIn a statement provided by the committee, which includes Democratic Sen.

{"prompt":"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday it is considering a request by members of Congress to waive federal restrictions on shipping to Puerto Rico , but has not received any formal requests","text":"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday it is considering a request by members of Congress to waive federal restrictions on shipping to Puerto Rico, but has not received any formal requests from the legislators.\nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's executive order prohibiting transportation of any U.S. products destined for the island was issued earlier this month after Puerto Rico's emergency management officials said the island has suffered numerous devastating hurricanes including Hurricane Mar\u00eda in a short time.\nPuerto Rico officials estimate that more than 20 billion in repairs and damage will be required to rebuild the island, after the region's biggest emergency in recent history.\nCongress was quick to approve $60 billion in aid for the Caribbean island following Hurricanes Irma and Maria but the bill was vetoed by President Donald Trump.\nPuerto Rico's Governor told reporters on Wednesday he does not want to rely on federal assistance but instead on private investors.\nHis officials say it may be possible for Puerto Rico to have a government that can pay its own bills and still depend on U.S. aid, although that aid would have to be provided by congressional authority.\nThe island will begin accepting applications for a government grant that will help borrowers refinance their home loans, said Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez Maldonado, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, Construction and Development.\nThe grant is not limited to homes that are in poor condition. An applicant can apply for the loan after repurchasing the home, though a loan can be used to fix any structural defects in the house.\nA grant of up to $18,000 can be used to buy the property and the rest of the money can be used toward the mortgage. A loan of $18,000 will cover up to 80 percent of the home's value.\nHousing Secretary Ben Carson on Thursday announced the Puerto Rican government will provide the U.S. Treasury Department with information about the program's eligibility requirements, which will be evaluated.\nPuerto Rico has been struggling for years with a deep budget crisis, and Congress has cut off annual aid to the island to avoid another scandal over the island's debt.\nPuerto Rico has not paid its debt in full even as it tries to get federal funds to pay utility and school bills before any economic recovery for much of the island takes place.\nThe news was a major blow as Puerto Rico's leaders try to get Congress to provide more funding for Hurricane Maria relief efforts on the island.\nCongress also passed a package of emergency funding to help Puerto Rico with its financial crisis, providing more help for utility and school bills ahead of a recovery that the island has yet to begin.\nU.S. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (D-CA), who had previously expressed interest in receiving the grant, said in a statement on Wednesday it was his understanding it would be granted only immediately.\n\u201cGiven the urgency of the federal government\u2019s commitment to the recovery of Hurricane Maria victims and the ongoing challenges for Puerto Rico,\u201d Gonzalez added, \u201cthis grant would be invaluable

He said South Korean intelligence agencies should have been more proactive in sharing information, saying North Korea\u2019s policies would have likely changed had the public known more early on.\n\u201cA lot of people, especially members from both sides of the house, have been talking about sharing information. What I think we should do is disseminate more of that information,\" he said. He added that the U.S. would have been able to stop the outbreak of the coronavirus had the government of North Korea been able to provide more information in advance.\n\u201cNorth Korea is not the only country in the world capable of spreading this virus,\u201d Kim Jung-suk said. \u201cI do not think the current efforts could have prevented the virus from spreading throughout the entire country of North Korea, had we not received information early.\u201d\nKim Jung-suk said the country was still locked down during the middle of April, when the country saw its best case with just a dozen cases.\n\u201cInstead of keeping up these strict lockdowns, we should have been sharing our information with other countries in advance,\" he said. \"We should have been more active in sharing information and that shouldn\u2019t have been a problem, if we were able to do this effectively.\"\nSouth Korea reported 923 new coronavirus cases and 14 deaths Wednesday; about 10 percent of them in Seoul.\nSo if we can get past all the hysterical hype in the media, that was more accurate than any of the predictions at the beginning of the pandemic, Kim said, \"...the virus definitely came back earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect any more lockdowns in South Korea anymore because we\u2019ve been able to prevent the spread and that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\" he said.\nThe professor also said there\u2019s little evidence for the idea that the virus originated in Hubei Province, China, due to the lockdown restrictions.\nHe said China should have been more transparent in the beginning. He said the government should have had access to more data and more of the medical records when this pandemic began.\n\u201cWe should have been a lot more prepared for this outbreak,\" he said, \"...but because of the lack of transparency, everything became more difficult and we got in a situation that is not very suitable for an epidemic.\u201d\nKim also told the subcommittee that North Korea was able to contain the spread by only isolating 10,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus; no mass testing has been carried out.

{"prompt":"Kansai Electric Power Co said on Friday it will decommission two 38-year-old reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant as Japan s electricity industry struggles to cope with new safety standards imposed after the 2011 Fukushima","text":"Kansai Electric Power Co said on Friday it will decommission two 38-year-old reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant as Japan s electricity industry struggles to cope with new safety standards imposed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.\nIn October last year, Kansai Electric Power Co said it intended to decommission two of its Ohi reactors, a move that has now had to be pushed back after government officials insisted on taking into consideration safety issues. Kansai Electric Power plans to decommission two more reactors at the site over two years.\nThe plan by Kansai Electric Power comes as Tokyo Electric Power Co, the nation s only privately owned energy company, seeks to lower costs by selling more of its nuclear plant power to others, particularly to utilities in the northeast, where demand for electricity is on the rise.\nDespite a rise in electricity costs and a glut of capacity following Japan s 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the national power corporation, which was forced to shut down nuclear reactors for nearly a year, plans to increase the share of nuclear power from 39 pct in this year to 44.\nJapan s nuclear power is expected to account for 38.3 pct with a peak capacity of 746 gigawatts of power installed by 2025. In the period, Japan has plans to increase nuclear capacity by 60 pct to 829 gigawatts by boosting the use of natural gas-powered units and moving away from carbon-fired generators.\nNuclear power is one of the safest sources of power because of the Japanese s commitment to safety over safety margins.\nThe Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 was Japan s worst in over a century. The world s worst nuclear plant accident took out control systems and shut 15 reactors after a tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japan s nuclear power has been accused of being too cheap to fix.\nThe Japanese industry regulator in 2012 imposed new safety rules, requiring a 10-year gap between major maintenance and inspections and a shorter inspection deadline for new plants.\nBut Japanese authorities have refused to adopt the European Union s three-day timeframe, instead requiring inspections every three years. Earlier this year, the Fukushima governor requested time to study the implications of the rules on nuclear plants in his region.\nWhile most other developed nations have decommissioned some or all of their nuclear generators, Japan has yet to come up with a systematic plan for such action. It has yet to adopt the European Union three-day inspection schedule and is also unwilling to stop using the Japanese-made, US-built Fessenheim plant.\nWhile Japan has not yet reached the point of decommissioning all its nuclear power, the company s decision to delay the decommissioning of Ohi reactors until new safety measures are agreed upon will be seen as a major achievement for Japanese nuclear operators, which are increasingly having to contend with nuclear safety issues abroad.\nWith the nuclear sector at the centre of Japan s battle against global warming, its biggest industrial sector, security of supply is the top issue for the government, although environmental advocates have been opposed to further moves to expand the scale of nuclear power. Nuclear power generated just 11.1 pct of Japan s total installed energy in the year to April 2017.\nThe Fukushima nuclear disaster, however, left Japan s population concerned about the safety of its nuclear plants, with Fukushima Governor Shunichi Masumura last year saying it looked like some plant operators only cared about keeping staff employment and

{"prompt":"Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Friday that the pension reform bill that is indispensable to reduce the nation s budget deficit must be voted on this year in the lower house of Congress before","text":"Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Friday that the pension reform bill that is indispensable to reduce the nation s budget deficit must be voted on this year in the lower house of Congress before the year ends.\n\"Sooner is better,\" Temer said in comments broadcast by the state-run TV Globo. \"We want to get the pension reform bill, even though it is not the bill we wanted to vote on, before the end of the year.\"\nBrazil will have to cut spending by more than 5 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to deal with the nation s budget deficit this year. A draft pension reform bill has been sent to the lower house of Congress but has not been debated nor voted on, according to Temer s office, leading to speculation that the government may be going ahead with a law from this year s start.\nThe pension system, of which a total of 7.4 million people - nearly one-third of Brazil s working-age population - are beneficiaries, is an important source of revenue for the current government of the left-wing Workers Party, which comes under political pressure from many sectors to implement reforms.\nIf approved, the bill would reduce the system s current defined-welfare formula for pensions, which is based on retirees s last pay and pension duration, to a more generous scheme where retirees can draw up to 120 percent of their pension for life.\nBrazil has one of the biggest pension systems in the world and the reform was long overdue, with an estimated economic cost of $25 billion. The public-health sector, education, the military, judges and police would be the first of nine groups of beneficiaries to be transformed in the system.\nIn his comments on Friday, Temer declined to explain who would pay for the reforms.\n\"In Brazil, no reforms to social safety nets are economically feasible if they have to do with government budget cuts,\" he said. \"Unless the government has economic resources to make the change. The pensions system is financed by workers and companies. There are also some other sources.\"\nThe reform, if approved, would require major changes in Brazil s legislation, which has a complicated system for deciding how retirees acquire a pension. Some say the bill should be implemented gradually to avoid making the system unworkable.\nIf a pension reform is implemented, the government estimates the pension system could save it about $17 billion a year in economic spending, more than the $19 billion it had estimated in its previous draft.\nIn an emergency session that came to a close on Friday, the lower house of Congress voted to approve several bills that dealt with social and economic issues, including pension and debt forgiveness.\nThe bill authorizing the government to borrow an additional 1 trillion reais ($286 billion) to reduce the deficit was approved. The bill, however, includes some sections with the possibility of veto by Temer and was submitted to his signature for approval. If the text is signed and no other bill or vote is done in this session, Temer will be free to veto it.\nFor the sixth consecutive year, the House of Representatives passed a bill allowing companies

{"prompt":"Hoping a thaw in relations with China will reopen opportunities after a diplomatic spat earlier this year cost many of them business , some 300 South Korean executives joined President Moon Jae-in for the start","text":"Hoping a thaw in relations with China will reopen opportunities after a diplomatic spat earlier this year cost many of them business, some 300 South Korean executives joined President Moon Jae-in for the start of the Asian Games at the Gangwondo stadium.\nThey listened as Moon praised the athletes for their achievements and pledged to work for a brighter future for the Games.\nLee Jae-myon, the deputy foreign minister of South Korea, said it was imperative for Seoul to return to being a credible sports partner. The Games was the first opportunity for many who have wanted to have more access to China, but have been unable to do so.\nDuring the Games opening ceremonies, the Korean flag waves above an inflatable that stands nearly five metres tall and is covered in the slogan \u201cFor the Asian Games of 2032\u201d. AFP\nThe government has previously warned that, if the bilateral tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies didn\u2019t clear up pronto, it may seek to ban the South Korean flag and any references to it in any official communications with China.\nIt is not the first time the government has urged the athletes to keep their eyes on the sky ahead in hopes of a calming of tensions between the two. During the Games opening ceremonies in Pyongyang, the Korean flag in a giant white inflatable was raised to the skies over a giant silver stadium lit up by a white light.\nWith just days, if not weeks, to go, organisers believe they have taken decisive action on the major ticket and food shortages that have threatened the Games and caused concern.\nFor Mr Lee, one of the greatest threats may be the fact that the Games, which officially open on October 23, and the Paralympics end on October 27. His ministry has been trying to arrange two additional days to let athletes get extra rest and recovery time.\nThe problem is that it will come at a cost. By the end of September, it had allocated \u00a52 billion (S$27.6 million) of the overall \u00a55.9 billion budget for the Paralympics, while the Games were given \u00a53.8 billion, compared with \u00a55.8 billion for the 2009 Games.\nIt is understood that the Olympic organising committee had a US$160 million budget up for grabs for the Games, which could end up being reduced.\nChina appears to be making the most of the postponement, as its delegation has increased sharply in numbers and will be led by Olympic vice-sport minister Liu Guang.\nThe Chinese government said that it would pay the Beijing Olympics organisers almost 10 per cent more than last year\u2019s US$5.5 billion budget despite the delay. It also confirmed that the Olympic village would remain under military command.\nIn a move that some observers say could help cool tensions, China agreed to postpone a planned visit from North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un to South Korea from last week until later in October.\nThe Games will continue in spite of the tensions, Olympic president Thomas Bach said yesterday. But he added it would be invaluable if the games could serve as an icebreaker between South Korea and China and restore relations between them to a level that would allow both to continue hosting such major sports competitions in the future.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on September 13, 2018, with the headline 'South Korean sports officials seek dialogue with China'.

{"prompt":"The U.S. Embassy to Russia said on Monday it would restart some visa services in U.S. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short-staffed . The United States","text":"The U.S. Embassy to Russia said on Monday it would restart some visa services in U.S. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short-staffed. The United States embassies in Moscow and Saint Petersburg were among six locations where embassies and consulates were forced to close for more than a year due to the fallout from the U.S.-Russian spat over the 2016 annexation of Crimea by Russia.\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - As China\u2019s economy softens ahead of the annual Communist Party congress next month, the country\u2019s central bank will no doubt act, and is unlikely to hesitate any longer, said an economist at Standard Chartered on Monday.\nThe central bank may have more to soften its stance on the economy this year, according to Standard Chartered economists, although they said the bank\u2019s balance sheet limits the amount it can cut.\nThe central bank has been treading a fine line between tightening interest rates to support the economy, while not hurting exporters. Earlier this month, the bank raised the key overnight refinancing rate up 50 basis points and cut the lending rate on savings accounts by 20 basis points. The central bank previously cut the lending rate by about 0.5per cent each year until March 2011.\nEconomists say that while the central bank has had to increase rates since March 2011 the sharpness of interest rate rises has been muted this year due to a more cautious outlook on China\u2019s growth, even as the country has been able to defy expectations and achieve modest GDP expansion this year.\n\u201cAt some point we expect a rate cut, but the timing is still unclear,\u201d said Andrew Harker, Head of US Financial Markets at Standard Chartered. \u201cOur view is that the current uptick in China\u2019s economy will have to be slowed down as the year ends.\u201d\n\u201cWe forecast that the PBOC may cut the central bank\u2019s key lending rate by 25 basis points by the end of this year, but that would still result in a 10 basis point jump in the central bank\u2019s lending rate.\u201d\nA rate cut would be one way to make it easier for businesses to continue investing in expansion plans, as the economy matures, he added, with an easing of lending standards such as allowing companies to borrow in the stock market at a cheaper rate.\nForecasters are expecting the official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing and services this month to fall below the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction. The PMI has dropped consistently to above that threshold since early July.\nOn Monday, the ministry of commerce said PMI data from July showed a sharp deterioration in indicators for manufacturing and services in August.\n\u201cThe recent deterioration in PMI data will require special attention to maintain economic momentum, ensure a stable macro-economy and secure full-play of the reform and opening-up initiatives to achieve a satisfactory outcome,\u201d it said.\nThe central bank has said it will continue to act to support the economy, even though it has already cut rates to the lowest

{"prompt":"Indonesian police have arrested an Australian , an American and a Malaysian on the holiday island of Bali for drugs offences , the latest foreigners to run afoul of some of the world s strictest","text":"Indonesian police have arrested an Australian, an American and a Malaysian on the holiday island of Bali for drugs offences, the latest foreigners to run afoul of some of the world s strictest laws against illegal drugs. A total of 22 people - aged 22 to 59 years - were taken to police headquarters in Sanur on Bali, just outside Denpasar. The men allegedly smuggled methamphetamine onto the island in a car driven by a Nigerian man. Bali police have confiscated three large amounts of methamphetamine - estimated at about 40 million rupiah (S$1,000) worth - from the Australian, American and Malaysian men. The Australian man is expected to be charged later this month with drug trafficking while the two Americans will be charged with the possession of heroin. There were no arrests yet on Friday on Bali where some of the worst drug laws in the world ban the smoking of marijuana in public and banning drugs, tobacco and alcohol sales in nightclubs. Indonesia has become a major market for illicit drugs being trafficked from Malaysia and Myanmar in Southeast Asia. The drug industry is estimated to bring in about 2 billion US dollars per year to Indonesia and drug kingpins regularly visit Bali who can get cheap tickets with the government to the tourist island. Mr Aria Sudibaja, chief of Bali police, says an increased number of foreigners on the island shows its popularity as a tourist destination and drug smuggling routes for criminals. He says Bali police have cracked down on drug dealers and arrested a major drug kingpin who was involved in the trafficking of drugs from Malaysia to Bali. He says it s the largest arrest of a drug dealer on the island since May last year. \" We have been targeting drug dealing criminals. We arrest as many as we can,\" said Mr Aria, adding that the suspects have gone on trial and that all were released but later arrested again. He says Bali police arrested several of his men, including an Australian who had previously been charged in the Bali drug-smuggling case and a Malaysian man in April. The latest arrests on Friday include two Australian and the Americans. Indonesia, a former British colony, has some of the harshest anti-drugs laws in the world. The government has also created a special zone near Bali and other places for testing suspected drugs. The government is also conducting a drug fight at home. Last month, Indonesian police seized 2.7 tonnes of heroin and took a top drug smuggler, who had links with foreign drug traffickers, into custody. A spokesman for the Immigration Service of Indonesia said: \"We have detained at least three groups trying to enter the country illegally through various methods. These groups include more than 200 people, who were recently arrested in the capital city, Jakarta.\" A spokesman for Indonesia Customs Service said: \"This year, we detained more than 2,500 people trying to bring drugs into Indonesia, including more than 400 foreigners.\" Many drug peddlers buy drugs from Indonesia where the smuggling of narcotics has become the largest organized crime business in Southeast Asia. Indonesia has been blamed for supplying more of the drugs being sold on the global market. The drug trade in Indonesia and Southeast Asia have been growing exponentially over the past decade, making it Asia s second major drug-supplying centre after the Philippines.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on August 26, 2007, with the headline 'Drugs busts arrest Indonesian, Malaysian'.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump is considering a scenario in which he would nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor for the two top positions at the Federal Reserve Board , White House","text":"President Donald Trump is considering a scenario in which he would nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor for the two top positions at the Federal Reserve Board, White House officials and officials with knowledge of the thinking said Tuesday.\nMr. Powell and Mr. Taylor, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, are the leading contenders for the Fed chair and vice-chair vacancies this fall, according to three of the four people who know about the president's thinking.\nThe president is considering Mr. Powell, who would be the first woman to lead the Fed. Ms. Taylor, a former Fed governor and a fellow alumnus of Stanford University, Mr. Trump's alma mater, is also a leading contender, according to two of the White House officials.\nThese officials declined to discuss details of Mr. Trump's thinking, but say the president likes both candidates' credentials and that there is goodwill between him and each. As a result, he will consult with them.\nMr. Trump, who called Mr. Powell a \"fireball\" during the campaign, has also expressed support for him as a person, according to White House aides.\nBut Mr. Trump is weighing whether to name his choice to head up the Federal Open Market Committee, after which the Fed would raise interest rates. The Fed's interest rate policy will have an effect on every American, with higher rates meaning more expensive loans and greater debt for retirees and those looking to buy a home, which the Fed considers an important part of an economy moving toward full employment.\nThe president is also considering including his pick to lead the Federal Reserve Board and perhaps including Mr. Taylor in the top two Fed positions, one of the officials said.\n\"To be fair to both candidates, it's important to look at their views,\" the official said. \"They both have interesting views but they also have other views on markets and markets are important to the economy as well.\"\nThe Fed is the primary bank of record for U.S. sovereign debt and issues federal funds that are seen as a proxy gauge for the yield on U.S. government bonds. It has a role in setting and communicating the U.S. federal funds rate and influences interest rates on consumer loans, mortgages and auto loans.\nMr. Powell, who has no formal relationship with the president and resigned as Fed chairman and governor last year, would become his first choice to lead the central bank, White House officials have said.\nMr. Powell, who has a formal appointment to oversee the Treasury Department's Office of Management and Budget, has not declined the offer, White House officials, who have spoken to a former White House national security official, have said.\nThe president's preference would make Ms. Taylor, who has a more active role in financial markets, a less likely candidate, the official with knowledge of Mr. Trump's thinking told Reuters.\nMs. Taylor, a former top Fed governor, has been a staunch supporter of deregulatory measures following the financial crisis. She helped guide the Fed toward more active interest rate policy in the aftermath of the 2008 recession.\nWhite House officials have said that Ms. Taylor may not be open to a role as a co-chair, a

{"prompt":"A Philippine college fraternity used its annual naked run on Friday to protest against President Rodrigo Duterte s brutal war on drugs and the imposition of martial law in the south in the army s","text":"A Philippine college fraternity used its annual naked run on Friday to protest against President Rodrigo Duterte s brutal war on drugs and the imposition of martial law in the south in the army s anti-insurgency campaign. The fraternity, Delta Sigma Theta Phi, said they would do their naughty stuff without taking off their clothes as part of their protest against President Duterte s war on drugs. It is the second time they have done this. We did this last year when the Philippines declared martial law in Mindanao. They took away our freedoms. This year they banished us from the campus. The annual naked run in the middle of the campus has been conducted by the organization since 2006. It was originally called the Nude Nerds Run, but it quickly became a symbol of protest against the controversial war on drugs, which has killed at least 30,000 people and upended the country s entire social fabric. The college, part of Loyola University of California, said they are now afraid they may be banned entirely, saying only 15 members will be allowed to attend this year. Our campus is about 40 hectares, an online student newspaper, Loyola Today, reported. No student group can have more than 30 members so this is the same for Delta Alpha Theta. Delta Sigma Theta Phi president Jason Cagigao told reporters they will only take part as they want to put pressure on the university and make President Duterte reconsider his war on drugs. In December, president Duterte imposed martial law over the whole of Mindanao, a province with about 2 million people, with the aim to curb the flow of drugs and aid police efforts. He also ordered a crackdown on a local militia, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of Malakan, which the local police say is backed by drugs syndicates. Duterte also accused the church of encouraging drug use and used words such as bastard and thief. Some of the university s students said they were also nervous about their safety and said that they were worried about the impact of draconian measures by President Duterte s administration. The university has not announced whether it wants the program to continue this year. However, Loyola Today said the campus security officers were not satisfied with their job and so planned to remove the security guards during the event. A police officer said they were preparing a written report on the incident. The Philippine Department of Justice estimated that drug use cost the country $35 billion the year of the war. The drug trade is now an army s main source of money and Duterte says the war is necessary to fight the drugs and terrorism rife in the country. President Duterte has ordered his military to kill anyone caught with drugs. He has since used that rhetoric to justify killing suspected criminals. In December he ordered those caught with cocaine or heroin sent to death camps. Duterte has also banned the sale and use of all kinds of cigarettes, including lighters, and said if he could only get the people he wanted to die for to smoke, he had enough to send them to their graves. Students in the city of San Juan De Oriente where the college was set up said they will only attend. We do not want to get blood on our hands. We are still the same people. We will respect the president, even though he doesn t love us, just because of the martial law. Students from the city of Bontoc said that they would not attend.

{"prompt":"A court in Somalia on Thursday released without charge a former minister and government critic who spent two days in jail after being arrested for alleged treason , an arrest which ignited a smoldering political","text":"A court in Somalia on Thursday released without charge a former minister and government critic who spent two days in jail after being arrested for alleged treason, an arrest which ignited a smoldering political feud in a tense country trying to come to terms with its bloody civil war.\nPolice detained Sadeq Hassan Abdullahi, the defence minister for nearly eight years during Somalia\u2019s war of independence from Ethiopia.\nBut he walked free after a judge said that he would not be prosecuted on a charge of treason, which carries a punishment of 25 years in prison under Somali law, for publicly criticising the government in social media posts last year.\nAbdullahi had said at the time that his release was a victory for the people of Somalia and that he would continue to fight for the freedoms he said had been taken back by autocratic rule.\nHe returned to Somalia from the United States in June with no criminal record and no charges, although his detention sparked angry protests from local supporters who were unimpressed by his alleged betrayal.\nSome of them called on the government to sack him in disgrace and his supporters have threatened to stage a mass protest if he is reinstated to office.\nAbdullahi\u2019s release came with a warning from Amnesty International that he faced death threats from supporters of the warlord who waged civil war against the government of Somalia, which collapsed almost five years ago.\nAmnesty said he faced a risk of \u201cpersecution and, for this reason, urgent assistance\u201d, raising concern that his case could be used to fuel violence in a country that has seen two bloody coups since 1991.\nThe court said that Abdullahi had not entered an agreement to the charge of treason, which carries a maximum punishment of 25 years imprisonment, although it said he had not yet been formally arraigned.\nAfter the verdict, his supporters gathered in the courtyards outside the town\u2019s court building to demonstrate his early release.\nThe group said they had been threatened by people who called him a traitor and that he was now free to be a political activist for the people.\nThe court said that there were no witnesses to corroborate Abdullahi\u2019s statement that he had been threatened.\nBut they did not rule out the possibility that his release was related to a recent attempt by people close to him to organise a protest against the government.\nThe court said he had been arrested without any charge and had been held in solitary in \u201ccruel and inhumane treatment conditions\u201d.\n\u201cI know you will free my brother. I am very happy,\u201d said one of his supporters, Hussein Yusuf Hassan, in a telephone interview after the verdict.\n\u201cThe government of Somalia should show it is serious about freedom of speech and freedom,\u201d he said.\nAbdullahi has been accused of criticising the government in numerous social media posts and an interview with radio station Shems FM.\nHis opponents claim he is an ally of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the warlord who was behind the fall of the government and the civil war that followed, and who was captured and imprisoned in Ethiopia a decade ago and was in custody of

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s eldest son and a former business associate of the president are due to testify to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , as it continues its investigation of possible","text":"President Donald Trump \u2019 s eldest son and a former business associate of the president are due to testify to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, as it continues its investigation of possible Russian election meddling last week, a presidential aide said, according to The Washington Post. \u201d They \u2019 re due to testify in about a week \u2019 s time. I assume their hearing is scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday of the week that \u2019 s coming up, \u00bb the aide said. \u00bb I thought that \u2019 s probably the most likely schedule. But as time goes by and all the different witnesses come testifying and there \u2019 s going to be a lot of people coming in on that floor. \u00bb The son, Donald Trump Jr., has said he\u2019s not part of a \u00bb plot. \u00bb He says he only became a \u00bb Trump family business associate \u00bb after the election. \u00bb But Trump Jr. has acknowledged that some of the members of his team, including Eric Trump, who is married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, and Jared Kushner have been working the \u00bb campaign to elect Donald Trump, \u00bb according to the Post.\nLast night an anonymous report by the New York Post published the names of several prominent members of GOP lawmakers who allegedly backed President Trump during last month\u2019s impeachment proceeding. The list is long and includes two senior GOP leaders, as well as at least one member of Congress\u2019 own impeachment inquiry. According to the Post, GOP caucus leaders at the beginning of the formal impeachment inquiry meeting, where all House Republicans present pledged their full support for their fellow Republican senators in the fight against the president, tried to keep the names of the lawmakers and the details of their support under wraps. However, a leaked audio clip of the House Republican Rules Committee meeting in the White House, leaked to the Washington Post, suggested that many of the lawmakers who were supposed to follow their oaths of office and vote to impeach the president and bar him from re-election made it clear that they were ready to support him without hesitation. According to the Washington Post report, all the lawmakers who reportedly participated in the meeting at the White House were Republican, and the leaked audio clip was released in an effort to pressure the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, into reopening the investigation into the potential criminal activity of President Trump last month. The report also revealed that the congressional leadership agreed that the House would vote on February 9 on whether to open the formal impeachment inquiry against the president while only a small group of lawmakers were actively discussing this issue. Among the lawmakers who support the impeachment move in the House are Representatives John Katko of New York (D), Liz Cheney of Wyoming (R), and David Cicilline of Rhode Island (D). The Post also reported that Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois (R), who became infamous last month because of his comments about removing President Trump\u2019s citizenship, is one of the Republicans who did not participate in the meeting at the White House and refused to support the impeachment bid. \u201c\nThis is where the real business of America begins.

Mark Zaid, an investigative writer and columnist who formerly worked as a Democratic congressional aide, met with special counsel Robert Mueller in Washington in the last week of March, the person said. They met a week after the FBI took office a year ago, the person said, asking only that their name not be revealed. The investigation into the origins of the dossier, which some see as a key element in the Mueller case, has been carried out by a special counsel-created task force led by the FBI deputy director, Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein wrote to the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General this month to ask why the FBI\u2019s investigation into the existence and origins of the dossier was so slow. While Rosenstein has not publicly addressed the allegation that Russia colluded with Trump campaign campaign staffers ahead of the 2016 election, he has met in recent weeks with congressional aides and White House officials, including aides to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as FBI investigators, people familiar with the matter said. Trump has said he never knew about the dossier, accusing his political opponents of fabricating it and trying to sway the American people. The dossier was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and published in June, as Trump was preparing to run for the presidency. The Washington Post published excerpts of the dossier, detailing claims that Russian intelligence officers sought Trump\u2019s presidential endorsement and threatened to release WikiLeaks data against Hillary Clinton if she won, and that Trump campaign aide Carter Page met with Russians ahead of the 2016 campaign. The Justice Department did not confirm Tuesday the meeting but noted it was an \u201congoing investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding a reported relationship between Mr. Page and a Russian government agent.\u201d The dossier alleged additional communications about Mr. Page\u2019s Russian meetings and said the FBI was investigating them.\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced the reopening of Pennsylvania\u2019s businesses as part of the phased re-opening of the U.S. economy due to the ongoing Coronavirus epidemic pandemic.\nIn a tweet, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced that \u201cthe next phase of reopening Pennsylvania begins today for businesses and some other industries.\u201d\nAs part of the announcement, Gov.

Wolf also announced a statewide curfew starting on Tuesday June 2nd, to coincide with the start of the second phase of the re-opening.\nAfter the announcement, the number of Coronavirus cases in

{"prompt":"Northern Irish sheep farmers like John Sheridan collectively transport more than 1,000 lambs a day over the Irish border for slaughter and shipment to shoppers across the European Union . At the moment , the","text":"Northern Irish sheep farmers like John Sheridan collectively transport more than 1,000 lambs a day over the Irish border for slaughter and shipment to shoppers across the European Union. At the moment, the Irish government and the European Commission have agreed that such transport will continue, despite concern among EU officials that it\u2019s a major contributor to the spread of the coronavirus.\nThe border isn\u2019t just a transportation hub for the sheep industry \u2013 in the past, sheep were transported in sheep ships along the sea. The shipment system closed in 1973, and the ship was removed and demolished in 1997. But now the ship returns for one final trip over in mid-July as the sheep industry and sheep farmers try to keep up with demand for sheep.\n\u201cI understand it is a sad day for us all \u2013 the Irish Sea is probably a place that is unique in the world we call our home,\u201d said Senator Sheridan after the visit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss the ship, and we\u2019ll still miss the sheep \u2013 of course, I hope we can all get back to some form of normal in a few weeks time so we never need to have to face such a crisis like this again,\u201d he said.\nThe Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney, said during the visit : \u201cWe have no choice but to maintain herding of the sheep, we have no other option.\u201d \u201c\nCoveney said they\u2019re looking to implement further measures to limit the spread of the virus, such as a ban on crossings from Spain.\nAfter the visit, Senator Sheridan said they plan to put their sheep back on a ship during the week-long shutdown at the end of July.\nYou may have heard reports claiming that you can only gain weight by eating. The myth that you can only gain weight by eating, however, is very misleading. Many people think that this is what they must do to increase their weight. Although it is true that if you want to gain weight, you may have to increase your calories intake, you will still need to increase the amount of protein you eat, which isn\u2019t just the meat of the animal that you eat, but also the meat of seafood and other protein sources like eggs.\nSo if you want to gain weight, don\u2019t have to worry about what you eat, as this is not the only thing which you should be concerned about. What you should be paying more attention is what you do after you eat your meals. If you are not physically active, most of the calories and fat will remain in your body as unwanted fat. If you want to lose weight, you must do two things. One is to increase the number of calories that you should burn and one of them is to make sure that you consume protein to provide your body with necessary support and help it keep muscle tissues and keep the body healthy.\nMany people think that a large meal will give them enough calories. However, this assumption is wrong, because when you eat a large amount of food, your stomach fills up and is unable to digest nutrients properly. After eating a large meal, you will have to wait a lot of time to do your regular physical activity. Therefore, you should not eat more than three times a day. If you can choose fruits, vegetables, eggs, and low-fat milk products, then this will be perfect for you.","token_len":705,"entropy":[8.1042,9.327,5.8435,6.8713,4.4773,7.454,11.9972,9.4849,2.3145,0.5515,2.7521,0.7548,0.6899,6.0045,0.007,1.2899,1.5319,5.2796,0.9993,2.8623,0.6601,4.5266,3.167,2.5162,8.3366,1.9016,11.2776,2.5638,0.3799,5.3192,0.4789,0.3512,6.0731,1.1324,2.9555,0.5004,1.8342,2.2582,2.2628,4.1741,1.3302,2.0074,0.6122,2.0961,3.2527,1.8948,5.1375,4.8831,1.7871,2.7509,1.9514,3.4728,7.5385,3.8257,3.1242,2.2634,0.8594,1.8436,18.5715,7.2444,2.7163,2.3491,3.7681,4.509,0.0331,1.1942,4.1205,0.0115,2.7462,13.4839,0.4005,0.0376,0.7382,0.8456,8.765,6.8845,7.6827,1.5249,1.0774,0.0479,4.4867,1.1263,7.2277,3.4459,1.8392,1.7382,3.3582,5.1331,4.8203,4.7597,2.4286,3.3899,1.0686,2.8417,2.431,1.9401,2.9429,4.3099,8.9233,4.7626,0.2737,4.5996,2.7518,2.3354,6.7008,6.0283,9.2641,0.813,5.2374,1.0768,1.4793,1.8295,5.9429,2.683,4.9016,3.6134,7.2984,1.3401,4.0573,0.5241,3.302,2.9305,2.0213,4.9557,8.0367,3.7261,6.1238,1.4441,2.7264,5.1964,6.2902,5.6622,0.1269,2.7294,4.7539,1.5373,2.1234,4.4661,4.4222,3.2134,1.7695,4.6402,0.1372,3.9232,0.827,0.5957,1.345,1.5899,2.5706,1.4764,0.5339,5.8222,5.2116,7.9109,5.27,4.5545,1.3154,1.5085,6.9343,0.8784,0.6117,4.7479,2.8575,4.2767,2.5264,3.064,8.8055,3.1638,7.255,3.1231,4.3336,1.708,2.2248,6.4381,1.1511,0.7685,0.2148,7.2999,4.4963,4.3944,0.1052,1.603,5.9553,7.8622,6.4882,6.9294,6.4017,5.6078,1.0951,4.7519,0.8452,0.9195,1.9203,0.9068,2.2701,5.0326,2.8877,2.3016,2.8782,0.2007,4.4378,1.5308,6.7569,2.0416,1.6855,1.3613,1.8677,0.542,1.2965,4.9669,1.9541,0.7658,0.9132,4.0009,6.7651,0.856,0.9805,4.0878,1.9811,1.8435,2.0489,2.5974,3.1174,3.5204,0.6048,4.8299,4.7926,0.0149,3.8081,7.014,3.1837,1.4056,1.3992,2.7418,5.8523,1.0249,5.5898,4.1671,0.2269,4.0505,0.4511,4.8145,3.8045,1.1099,5.4473,5.1889,0.3445,0.233,3.0036,0.7625,2.1817,2.8179,0.9073,0.154,0.32,2.0833,4.4111,1.3255,1.8264,1.2383,2.7768,0.135,6.5095,5.8206,1.6742,3.9047,0.6924,0.0012,0.0,0.3208,1.3238,5.7384,0.7278,0.2255,8.2286,2.8953,2.7776,1.6572,2.2581,4.406,2.3483,0.4757,0.0334,5.2759,7.6589,6.5501,3.2893,1.9222,0.7756,2.406,4.9281,1.5639,1.938,3.1213,1.9629,2.0437,3.2741,2.1732,3.8514,0.1896,4.8316,6.4339,0.0018,0.0017,1.4257,5.3706,3.2781,0.6288,2.3432,3.3594,1.9415,4.3738,5.1961,1.2677,0.5063,5.7754,0.4708,0.3249,0.032,1.5622,3.5183,1.5561,2.6335,0.0023,3.264,2.1739,0.0499,8.8059,2.7433,6.2111,3.251,0.6959,6.0958,1.0185,1.2168,0.3186,4.8549,0.0785,1.8394,3.5289,6.43,0.0793,5.2391,4.187,4.2139,3.0797,1.3504,4.2947,1.7414,5.1299,0.5947,3.281,3.9295,0.1536,7.104,3.5824,0.8116,3.9652,0.0026,1.7042,0.5549,0.7854,6.0795,3.3198,2.5839,1.2141,5.4315,7.2234,0.5105,7.0888,1.6156,2.9803,8.0667,8.2009,1.4583,2.2794,7.3936,2.8224,7.3432,3.1697,1.0911,0.4274,1.7933,0.756,0.0732,0.528,0.1151,3.8132,2.081,0.151,1.0558,4.8682,1.447,0.6345,4.4886,1.2086,3.6637,0.6943,3.9978,0.7028,4.3908,1.9698,5.195,0.7765,0.5412,4.8313,0.2236,0.8139,1.2834,5.4777,2.3742,0.6113,0.8633,0.1547,4.3116,0.2587,3.8364,0.0852,1.3109,0.2104,0.731,0.5074,4.2073,1.7471,0.043,4.375,0.3094,3.4709,5.4226,2.0973,3.9136,2.8486,3.9943,1.7241,0.141,3.2723,2.5341,1.5276,0.1135,2.2085,1.1023,1.3775,1.6935,3.7677,6.0588,0.5492,0.6781,0.0171,4.4216,3.4691,3.1927,3.9389,1.3003,2.7321,2.9036,0.6068,0.952,1.8929,1.6439,1.1653,0.8897,2.3579,0.5696,9.4042,1.7733,2.0711,5.0567,0.9384,3.7517,2.297,1.7504,0.9384,5.0102,2.627,0.1858,1.1983,0.0348,0.6718,0.136,0.4501,5.0323,0.3913,0.2421,0.0025,4.9265,0.2501,2.8518,0.1772,4.0181,1.2413,1.3162,1.7293,2.5698,3.9416,0.8518,3.0242,2.374,2.334,3.1084,6.5665,1.3269,3.4546,2.5985,3.2741,0.0515,0.4248,5.516,0.8987,1.3995,1.0623,7.1568,5.9684,0.0045,4.6697,2.4031,0.7888,3.4681,3.8368,1.0009,1.5022,3.3511,1.9969,0.7574,2.7768,0.1506,1.6061,2.4403,6.3935,1.0955,0.6943,6.8541,1.1442,0.3599,4.7087,4.7115,2.8654,3.3293,4.1511,1.0345,0.4513,1.1673,3.6406,12.405,4.3509,1.2468,2.3103,0.1242,3.1076,0.0649,1.0699,0.0772,0.3507,1.3586,2.3261,3.3105,5.5772,0.0218,1.5412,1.9776,1.2561,0.3794,3.3862,1.723,2.8547,0.0358,0.4639,2.3614,0.3589,5.8352,3.3738,2.7631,2.737,5.5045,2.6735,0.1542,0.2198,4.0238,1.1708,0.2931,0.4747,3.144,5.4885,4.1181,4.8875,2.4308,0.1581,0.0863,5.4517,6.1095,2.1322,5.4022,1.6918,4.2255,5.8816,6.888,2.869,6.6212,2.3073,1.8705,1.9014,0.2913,0.6925,4.8457,0.6813,2.2985,0.1738,4.261,3.5178,2.086,2.5999,3.266,1.2061,3.9967,1.4783,3.8424,1.588,0.0671,2.1039,5.6438,0.5882,2.0654,2.1265,1.5999,3.8258,0.5067,0.9523,1.2884,0.3748,4.0281,0.1667,1.3924,0.5624,1.9205,5.9167,4.3867,0.4768,1.8928,4.8457,3.9601,0.0037,5.078,5.7174,4.8124,0.3444,5.2098,1.472,1.3816,0.3979,0.7387,0.292,2.1905,1.8403,2.4302,0.9516,5.5343,1.9098,4.0078,1.9359,0.0827,0.994,5.6617,1.5637,4.5203,3.6423,0.4063,1.3016,4.0252,0.157,1.9995,1.5463,2.2114,1.3784,2.1575,0.3552,3.4783,1.9074,0.3421,0.5703,1.1585,2.7665,0.118,3.9579,6.5481,9.3383,1.8142,0.1373,0.5866,4.4005,0.652,2.1584,6.0257,0.7347,0.4744,2.1286,4.8479,0.4503,1.2828,2.8535,1.2015,2.3683,7.9032,0.7431,0.1724,0.3047]}
{"prompt":"A former Islamic State warlord suspected of masterminding a deadly attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 is believed to have been killed during a special operation in ex-Soviet Georgia last week , three sources familiar","text":"A former Islamic State warlord suspected of masterminding a deadly attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 is believed to have been killed during a special operation in ex-Soviet Georgia last week, three sources familiar with the case told Reuters.\nObergruppenfuhrer Khalid Abu Eid, a former U.S. military special forces operative, was found shot to death during a raid on an army unit in Gori, an unincorporated town in South Ossetia on Monday, a military commander confirmed.\nPolice in Georgia arrested an Army captain suspected of being a member of Abu Eid's group, and another man was identified by the police as his driver who was shot at the initial raid, sources told Reuters.\nPolice arrested two officers in the military unit and a paramedic, they added.\nThe raid, conducted in compliance with an Interpol arrest warrant, was initiated by a police task force in Tbilisi, who tracked down Abu Eid's vehicle. The officers involved in the killing did not get to see the suspect and he did not know they were seeking him, a senior ex-spy who was with the special forces told Reuters.\nThe raid, which came after months of intense international scrutiny of the suspected Islamic State terrorist group, was the first U.S.-led operation in which a suspect allegedly linked to ISIS has been killed, although the U.S., EU and NATO have not confirmed the killing or stated whether Abu Eid was alive.\nU.S. President Donald Trump did not reveal the source of the latest intelligence regarding Abu Eid's whereabouts during announcements at the White House after the raid.\nThe U.S. ambassador to NATO warned that the operation was an attempt to distract from the \"catastrophe\" in western Iraq and Iraq's security chiefs in the U.K. and German foreign ministries said they were \"deeply deploring these attacks upon our allies.\"\nPolice said they will soon announce further details. Russia-Ossetia relations worsened in the months prior to Monday's raid after the Georgian militia sent troops to defend an oil pipeline run by Russian energy giant, Gazprom. Georgia, which was a Soviet republic until 1991, has been riven since the Russian-backed breakaway republic of South Ossetia occupied its capital of Tskhinvali in 2008.\nSouth Ossetia has been an independent republic since 1992 but is not recognized by the United Nations and Russia and Georgia do not recognize its sovereignty.\nThe Islamic State has repeatedly claimed responsibility for attacks that have targeted Russian-backed regimes in Iraq and has vowed to strike back at NATO and its allies because of their presence in Iraq.\nThe group has vowed to strike back in retaliation, especially against European capitals and Washington, and has used an array of weapons, including grenades and rockets.\nRussian military spokesman Col. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday Russian forces monitored developments at the Gori military unit and were ready to respond if needed.\nKonashenkov said Russia \"has not taken any decisions to withdraw troops from South Ossetia,\" which has not faced outside military intervention since an attempted uprising by separatists in 1991.\nThe separatists lost about three-quarters of the territory it had

{"prompt":"Mexican authorities said on Tuesday they will aim to identify some 3,000 bone fragments , apparently human , found at the weekend in the northern state of Coahuila , where organized crime has been blamed","text":"Mexican authorities said on Tuesday they will aim to identify some 3,000 bone fragments, apparently human, found at the weekend in the northern state of Coahuila, where organized crime has been blamed for the recent wave of violence.\nIt comes just days after several hundred skulls and human remains were unearthed at an open-air grave in the same central Mexican state.\nThe skulls have been examined by archaeologist Daniel Flores, who said they belonged to an adult female.\n\u201cThese are human skulls that have suffered a lot of physical suffering and that have been badly burned, \u201d said Mr Flores, who estimates that some 3,000 fragments could actually be the bones of a single person.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not a single body that had been dumped here. \u201d\nSome observers say the sudden discovery of skulls suggests that the phenomenon of the recent wave of violence may be more than mass graves containing the corpses of dozens or even hundreds of killings.\nMr Flores said he hoped to identify the bones he and his colleagues were working on and the victims\u2019 identities in several weeks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain way these things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was already a human body dumped here.\n\u201cThese human beings \u2014 they were not murdered and there were a lot of people at the scene. \u201d\nThe skulls were found by a tourist in the area known as La Tinaja, in the municipality of Canelas, near the city of Piedras Negras.\nThe National University of Coahuila provided the institute with an archaeological kit that was able to confirm the presence of human remains.\nMs Margarita Robles Lira, a spokeswoman for the Federal District Police, told journalists it was believed the skeletons belonged to a group of 20-30 people.\nHowever, she said it was not yet clear whether it was an organized crime ring that had been responsible for the discovery.\n\u201cWe\u2019re checking the origin of the remains, but given the condition of the bones, we can say that many years ago someone was probably there. \u201d\nFederal authorities said the skeletons were found when a tourist, who had a map showing the place, went hiking in the region.\nThey also showed the map, found inside the graves\u2019 liners, which they said proved that the skulls had been carried there.\nMr Flores said the archaeologists had also located a large number of small jars and sacks of black and white cement and several large bags of cement wrapped in canvas.\nThe skeleton found in the area was that of a man who died about 120 years ago.\nLocal authorities said it had been carried to the site in a heavy suitcase.\nMany of the graves have been opened by organized crime, said local authorities, pointing to the discovery of human remains scattered throughout the land known as \u2018 Cemetery \u2019.\nIn the north of the state, in December, archaeologists from the university and the National Police found the bones of 11 men in an abandoned mausoleum in the town of Matamoros.\nThe graves were dug more than 20 metres underground, and there was evidence of human activity and violence in the area.\nThe State Attorney

{"prompt":"The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018 , despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut","text":"The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down \u2014 because it can produce new information, new evidence, and ultimately new criminal charges.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion a panel of the Trump administration\u2019s criminal justice task force released yesterday in support of the special counsel\u2019s investigation of foreign political interference in the 2016 election.\n\u201cThe Russia narrative \u201d \u2014 the theory that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump, and has since sought to undermine the results \u2014 \u201cshows no signs of terminating,\u201d according to the report, a collection of government officials, legal experts, and Republican lawyers.\n\u201cSo it is hard to imagine how that narrative would end when the special counsel takes his report and produces the indictments,\u201d Dina Powell of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy told CNN on Sunday about Russian efforts to interfere with the election and the special counsel.\nPowell argued that Trump\u2019s claims that the Russia dossier was fabricated have undermined public confidence in the 2016 election process, and that it will take a year to evaluate if Russia\u2019s efforts were successful, before it can be said whether the investigation has produced new information.\n\u201cMy guess is that the dossier didn\u2019t materialize, but that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re going to have to think about,\u201d Powell said.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the special counsel going to do about it? You can have special counsels going on for decades,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cFor example, we have two special counsels here in Washington, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about another.\u201d\nThe special counsel has so far concluded the Russian campaign forged documents and spread disinformation to sway voters before the 2016 campaign and after that, using the 2016 election as a vehicle to sway American politics.\nBut while the special counsel\u2019s investigation could find new information, even some Trump administration officials are concerned about how it will be conducted in the next year. The Trump administration\u2019s criminal justice task force says it needs an independent \u201cjudicial oversight mechanism\u201d after the fact to assure that any new evidence is heard, and appropriate charges are not made against people other than the Russian government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to think about,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWon\u2019t it be helpful if we have that independent judicial oversight mechanism so we can make sure that the facts, the facts, the facts are properly considered by our courts and our courts are properly considered by the Special Counsel, so it\u2019s not like this is a one-person show.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible that the special counsel has not gotten the full picture,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Fox News. \u201cThere are many things the special counsel doesn\u2019t know, and they have to consider that as they prepare to

{"prompt":"The U.S. government made it tougher on Wednesday for Americans to visit Cuba and do business in the country , making good on a pledge by President Donald Trump to roll back his Democratic predecessor","text":"The U.S. government made it tougher on Wednesday for Americans to visit Cuba and do business in the country, making good on a pledge by President Donald Trump to roll back his Democratic predecessor\u2019s historic travel ban.\nTrump imposed a travel ban on December 26, saying it was unfair and unnecessary to allow foreigners to come to Cuba, which only a handful of countries recognize, for commercial and political reasons, such as the U.S. government\u2019s support for President Raul Castro.\nIn February, Trump signed a so-called travel bubble with Havana that allows U.S. passport holders to travel from and to Cuba. The U.S. has maintained strict travel restrictions in the 1950s to the late 1990s, a period when tensions between Cuba and the United States reached their highest level.\nIn his new executive order, Trump said those restrictions and the ban on travel from Cuba would be permanent, and he ordered congressional support for the move.\n\u201cThe policies that have caused the hostility between the governments of our two countries can no longer be tolerated,\u201d Trump said at the White House.\n\u201cIt does not serve the interests of American businesses or citizens to allow the United States to be viewed in Cuba as a place hostile to business and commerce.\nU.S. business leaders have raised fears that the new restrictions would impact sales to Cuba. In a statement issued last year, the chamber of commerce representing business from all 50 states and the District of Columbia said there would be a direct impact on U.S. products and supplies traveling to Cuba.\nThe order also requires U.S. officials to make efforts with Cubans to encourage dialogue on the hostility between the two nations.\nCuba, which blames Venezuela\u2019s lackluster economy on U.S. sanctions, has seen its economy weaken considerably in recent years.\nIn 2018, for example, the Cuban government blamed the U.S. sanctions for a decline in exports of $1 billion.\nIn another statement, the Cuban government said its move \u201cwas a necessary and timely measure that will significantly contribute to the reestablishment of the normalcy required for the strengthening of our relationship with the United States.\u201d\nBut it said the decision also provides \u201cthe necessary basis\u201d to reopen diplomatic ties, a step which was blocked by U.S. officials a year ago.\n\u201cAt the same time, with the implementation of these measures, the Cuban government takes the initiative,\u201d the statement said.\nA Cubana de Aviacion Boeing 737-400 aircraft makes a takeoff during a test flight from Havana's Rafael Nunez airport in Havana, Cuba. July 11, 2018. (AP Photo\/Benett Masson\/The Associated Press)\nBoeing and McDonnell Douglas have proposed that Cuba be allowed to lease aircraft under a new Aircraft Leasing Program, the governments of Cuba and the United States announced Wednesday.\nThey also announced that the governments of Cuba and the United States would have a formalized arrangement with the Air Transport Association of America to develop the Cuban Air Transport Company.\nThe airlines will have to meet various conditions to operate under the lease program, including paying $18 million in taxes to the Cuban government.\nThe Cuban Air

The person, who wished not to be identified, said Chao, who will make the announcement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will unveil a voluntary set of safety guidelines to ensure vehicles will not pose safety risks to human drivers. The department plans to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other stakeholders to provide clear guidance to those who develop autonomous vehicles and are considering the technology, the person said. The Department... Read More\nThe Department of Transportation, under pressure from lawmakers from all parties, is exploring what it could do to mandate that cars be equipped with autonomous emergency braking systems. The question of whether the government will try to regulate this new safety feature, which is already being installed in many cars sold in this country, has become a hot topic as the U.S. tries to catch up with other major countries in the field of autonomous cars. For years, the Transportation and Safety Administration has tried, unsuccessfully, to gain a position in the field, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a division of the Department, never wanted to get involved with safety issues surrounding the technology... Read More\nA key concern of regulators looking to develop autonomous vehicles (AVs) is ensuring that their driverless vehicles can also be easily interfaced to roads, highways and other public infrastructure. A survey of the industry done by the Federal Highway Administration and the University of Missouri found that some AVs companies do not have effective interconnected infrastructure standards in place. Some firms such as Uber, Google, and Microsoft do not have any interconnected infrastructure standards. Some require a special device to work on certain platforms. And others require devices other than those that the industry has been promoting. As a result, the FHWA and the University of Missouri... Read More\nWarren Buffett has been one of the most vocal investors voicing his opposition to self-driving cars. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has repeatedly said he is worried about a potential technology that can replace humans. But he may need to change his mind. A report released earlier this month shows that self-driving technology is now being tested in over 700 cities and towns. But the companies have been working on the technologies far longer. The report is released by the consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group that has been monitoring the development of autonomous car technology since 2011. It finds that in 2018 alone, 700,000 AVs will be able to operate on open streets and roads. That will represent an increase of 2.6 times,... Read More\nAutonomous vehicle testers, and manufacturers of the technology, have seen dramatic increases in traffic since the launch of self-driving cars. The introduction of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace isn\u2019t slowing down \u2014 it is going from state to state, city to city. Over time, this could turn the autonomous vehicle industry one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S. The industry has seen some of the strongest growth in the transportation business since the adoption of self-driving vehicles.

{"prompt":"Saudi Arabia on Thursday welcomed a United Nations report and a U.S. stand on Iran s missile supplies to Yemen s Houthis and demanded immediate action to hold Tehran accountable for its actions , state","text":"Saudi Arabia on Thursday welcomed a United Nations report and a U.S. stand on Iran s missile supplies to Yemen s Houthis and demanded immediate action to hold Tehran accountable for its actions, state news reports said.\nThe country s top foreign minister told the Arabic-language al-Arabiya television that the U.N. report on Iran s \u201cterrorist\u201d programs did not provide legal basis for the U.S. military s killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.\nThe General, the most powerful Iranian figure and one of the architects of Iran s nuclear program, was assassinated by U.S. troops in a drone strike outside Tehran on Friday.\n\u201cWe have no right at all to kill the General, even through drone attacks like we did today,\u201d Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the TV station.\nSoleimani\u2019s killing drew flak from the U.S. and from European allies who said it constituted an attack on international law. The U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, on Thursday tweeted on Twitter \u201cwe have no right\u201d to kill anyone \u201cwherever in the world they are, and that includes the Qassem Soleimani.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also tweeted out a series of tweets expressing his anger toward the killing of Soleimani and calling on other countries to follow suit and expel Iranian diplomats.\nForeign Minister Al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia condemned any country that supports the Iranian opposition forces and stressed that the United Arab Emirates had been cooperating with Saudi Arabia in preventing any Iranian arms or war planes from entering Saudi territory.\nQatar has also taken a similar stance saying that the killing of Soleimani was an unjustified act and urged for an immediate end to Iran s support of terror across the region, as well as in other countries. The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh on Thursday suspended services for now.\n\u201cWe welcome the fact of the new position... and stand behind the United Nations report which concluded that Iran carried out terrorist programs over decades and supports terrorism,\u201d a ministry spokesman said in a statement.\n\u201cThe report confirmed the allegations regarding Iran s support for the Houthi rebels,\u201d said Saad al-Sheeb, a member of the Saudi Foreign Affairs Committee.\nAn Iranian security official told state radio on Thursday that the killing of Soleimani by the U.S. strike would be condemned worldwide as an act that targeted \u201cfreedom and security.\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Iran will continue to have no sympathy for the Americans and \u201cthe people of the (Yemeni) Arab states (will not) tolerate any act that threatens their independence and security.\u201d\nU.S. President Donald Trump has announced a major escalation of military pressure on Iran, vowing to force major Tehran-backed rebels in Yemen to withdraw and stop supplying the rebels with weaponry and U.S.-backed troops in eastern Syria have been ordered to withdraw after several airstrikes killed three Iranian military officers and a number of al Qaeda jihadists in a remote region of Syria.\nThe killing comes after a two day military strike killed at least 26 Iranian military personnel and several al Qaeda jihadists in Baghdad on Friday.

{"prompt":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday the Trump administration may seek a provision to deter currency manipulation in the North American Free Trade Agreement as part of its planning for future free trade","text":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday the Trump administration may seek a provision to deter currency manipulation in the North American Free Trade Agreement as part of its planning for future free trade negotiations.\n\"There is the possibility that this sort of thing won't be allowed,\" he said on CNBC. \"Maybe we can include something that says, 'if you want to use the dollar to manipulate, don't do it.'\"\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade secretary, Wilbur Ross, called on his national security team last week to review the current U.S. trade law ahead of any potential negotiations over a new trade deal with the European Union and to seek changes to the current rules if needed.\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has been at odds with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over efforts to limit currency manipulation by U.S. companies and investors, and the Trump administration may move to tighten supervision of some U.S. businesses, according to both officials.\nLighthizer and Mnuchin have said they view manipulation as a criminal act and have pushed for tightening up regulations for some U.S. banks that use derivatives to take riskier positions and avoid penalties under U.S. law.\nBut Lighthizer and Mnuchin have also said their top priorities are to convince the European Union to approve a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement and close a renegotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the face of U.S. pressure to open up some agriculture, auto and finance policy.\n\"I think there are ways you can do it that are very clever in terms of just using the rules that exist but making sure they're implemented very carefully,\" Lighthizer told Axios in a recent interview. \"If there's something you think needs to be changed, I'm there.\"\nThe Trade War: Trump Signs Deals to Limit Steel And Aluminum | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nThe Trump administration confirmed Thursday that it plans to sign three separate deals to limit steel and aluminum imports to the United States, as steel output in China begins to increase despite U.S. efforts to limit the material's production.\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he's still considering tariffs on foreign cars and auto parts to curb imports in the wake of the death of a U.S. man killed while driving a Tesla Model X.\nHe also said that China \"has not been forthcoming at all.\" And he's said that the trade war could go on for a long time.\nBoris Johnson's trade deal with China could trigger a global crisis over the country\u2019s supply of coronavirus vaccines.\nThe agreement, outlined by Downing Street on Thursday, is set to be signed in China over the coming days.\nThe EU and China did not agree on the EU\u2019s \u201cwish list\u201d, according to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. He said that China offered \u201cvery little\u201d concessions, after European nations were granted the right to impose additional tariffs on an unstated list of U.S. products.

In the US, the president and his team are going after a deal that would benefit mostly the Chinese, according to news reports.\nThe meeting of the United States, Japan and Australia would not only be another step in the China - Asean campaign, but also is aimed at taking advantage over Beijing, as Beijing is trying to reach out as far as possible to the rest of Asia, says The Wall Street Journal.\nIn the Philippines, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on Tuesday said that she will urge her Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao at an Asean summit last week to conclude talks on an agreement with Beijing to cut tariffs on products from the Asean states.\nIn an interview with the local Manila Standard Today television station, Mrs Arroyo said the Philippines, the third most heavily subsidized economy, would be willing to cut off its subsidy to the China - ASEAN trade deal while seeking a fairer deal on China - Australia trade. \"We have been negotiating with China for an FTA,\" she said.","token_len":708,"entropy":[8.7536,4.7734,6.8591,1.3928,7.6023,0.9437,0.0688,2.4487,1.4932,8.5503,0.1977,6.7284,0.02,0.4708,1.6772,1.7644,1.7653,6.2633,5.095,0.1857,2.2305,0.5849,5.1516,10.9703,0.7048,5.4434,7.1333,1.8326,5.3276,5.1415,1.8894,4.3842,4.4531,4.3113,0.0617,0.2501,0.1527,11.0463,1.7556,3.64,0.3549,4.8474,1.824,1.5629,1.7754,5.8259,5.1053,4.4509,0.0854,2.3285,0.5721,1.8595,0.6854,0.7049,2.2832,1.8141,0.6475,0.0174,1.8843,3.2421,5.7823,0.2606,0.4027,2.0799,2.1592,2.3194,5.2596,5.2261,2.7047,1.1482,1.3546,1.9848,2.3204,1.8702,2.4105,2.4989,2.9902,0.9724,2.4795,2.4999,2.1958,3.6296,4.9145,0.006,2.3997,1.4658,3.7365,0.8922,0.072,5.0048,0.4,1.8496,4.1446,0.0119,4.1299,3.0076,2.4343,4.2014,0.8097,1.8971,1.5471,1.786,4.0918,1.7357,1.5501,2.999,3.2504,0.68,1.1226,0.2348,6.1749,2.5458,0.16,4.023,1.564,3.5271,3.889,0.395,5.2776,2.4811,5.5852,3.4308,0.044,5.0502,2.1667,2.9866,1.0732,2.3387,15.8027,9.2928,0.7328,0.0594,2.801,7.3688,1.6758,5.7206,5.2495,1.5625,3.2026,9.341,0.101,1.9211,1.3908,0.0677,0.0202,1.3656,11.2172,2.7765,0.0027,0.8153,5.7891,5.3835,0.0005,1.4001,3.9013,6.6373,0.0721,1.4435,5.7692,1.9654,2.6335,5.6749,3.7344,2.1423,0.558,8.1925,2.3432,0.682,4.0585,1.4863,0.2786,4.7796,5.1799,2.1066,0.1972,4.5169,6.4191,1.3476,5.4236,4.9858,2.5204,1.1222,0.358,4.5861,2.9794,1.6378,5.6468,5.4644,0.1294,6.8172,0.0241,5.3565,7.4811,1.1259,4.3938,3.0879,0.0025,0.5213,5.1728,0.0065,0.5686,0.3126,5.8916,4.0569,0.2764,3.0743,1.611,3.0835,2.8857,0.7052,1.1676,0.1804,0.5513,2.5276,0.9105,0.9673,5.9008,9.3371,3.4085,0.028,0.0038,5.4362,3.2761,5.6328,0.0735,1.3387,7.7184,5.1426,4.9675,1.8139,1.3222,0.0707,0.0328,5.6376,1.0323,4.8381,1.0245,4.1984,0.731,0.0342,1.9856,3.1152,1.5802,5.6269,0.2752,3.0793,0.1301,4.7735,0.4099,0.5631,3.5265,1.7026,0.3314,2.2528,5.958,1.0416,3.2409,1.9539,2.1163,5.0961,1.8515,1.5348,0.0069,0.0058,3.7236,2.417,5.9228,0.2092,0.0601,3.1231,2.3955,0.3316,0.6586,2.059,2.8994,2.0731,1.8715,2.953,0.0225,1.8564,3.5335,6.0845,3.5562,2.6948,3.3048,2.0929,5.3678,1.3166,3.9868,0.6349,0.5445,6.5896,6.4551,0.1215,0.0006,0.0002,1.8545,6.9899,0.4088,5.8301,0.7804,6.1852,0.0044,6.0393,0.8814,0.175,0.3373,0.0291,0.0378,4.545,2.3622,3.4766,0.0581,5.4331,7.218,0.0249,4.6,3.5089,4.4652,2.1021,1.7488,8.1412,1.3314,0.6715,3.4876,5.3217,0.0507,3.7747,0.0031,2.5099,0.0104,0.001,0.0961,0.0009,0.0019,0.0018,2.7291,1.6237,4.957,4.4187,1.6611,2.2473,1.6898,4.3994,3.7366,0.2043,3.5548,1.0538,0.8541,3.9273,0.8253,2.2753,2.9187,4.0679,8.9424,1.1071,8.9816,4.3739,4.6307,0.1845,0.3149,0.0009,0.7839,0.3857,2.3966,3.5543,2.4944,0.0591,4.6725,1.1425,1.2264,4.4531,0.5984,0.9606,0.4235,0.0067,0.0059,8.7151,2.7787,4.3054,6.2095,0.5231,4.8755,2.0241,0.8148,0.185,8.1689,7.6719,0.0776,0.0016,4.0742,1.1945,6.1707,4.7581,1.4054,3.9898,1.6392,4.3158,2.8739,4.2548,4.6935,6.6917,0.389,1.5992,0.7615,4.015,4.9077,0.2636,0.8375,2.6924,3.2595,6.5409,3.4665,0.0186,7.7061,0.5978,0.6592,0.355,3.4097,1.2755,0.8903,0.8925,0.9856,2.7975,4.7973,1.2439,3.0928,2.4673,2.9406,4.0324,1.6841,4.0806,3.4083,6.7317,2.1987,0.6604,4.0655,5.647,2.6814,3.1165,3.7443,4.1829,0.321,4.8391,0.7253,0.9997,2.831,0.9808,0.3862,1.8595,4.5051,0.3249,0.3191,0.0003,0.0015,4.3737,5.1501,1.7537,2.4615,0.1184,2.7287,0.2837,2.0989,5.1651,0.2474,3.3402,6.0987,0.6354,0.4753,0.0047,0.3927,1.2958,0.026,0.0025,7.5586,0.0034,2.5138,3.8699,0.0016,1.198,2.0514,2.7531,1.7504,5.1979,3.901,6.031,4.4946,2.4888,0.4963,5.4861,6.4978,6.2141,5.0958,0.7267,5.2995,1.9847,2.435,0.3743,1.1646,5.415,2.1796,2.2187,3.7663,1.669,6.1185,4.8613,2.7244,3.7369,1.0266,1.7127,4.4585,7.0813,1.7979,2.3504,1.8419,4.0586,0.0019,6.6166,0.2452,0.2762,0.4675,1.6524,5.4764,1.9527,1.3365,6.7568,0.2708,1.2222,1.8066,1.5781,3.5096,4.4256,4.3691,4.5791,1.5051,6.5187,2.8149,1.1241,1.1454,4.0759,5.0647,0.0334,0.0005,0.0007,5.942,1.8394,0.3062,0.579,7.0993,3.2925,0.0327,5.7839,3.2647,10.7835,5.4046,3.235,3.5123,4.1715,2.3157,3.0401,0.0318,5.3158,1.8416,6.6196,2.3117,0.8035,0.6408,0.1132,1.6698,4.1787,0.0033,1.1573,2.2379,4.8367,3.8014,2.5587,0.0006,0.0008,0.3661,0.3695,2.9954,1.9136,4.2286,0.1225,2.1794,6.9162,0.0075,0.0001,0.001,0.0002,0.8389,0.0095,0.0017,0.0002,3.7842,0.8064,1.5632,1.3675,2.2631,3.3231,5.7373,2.7621,2.6452,0.163,5.221,0.0733,0.0003,0.0035,6.2098,4.0696,0.6658,0.0474,0.001,0.3999,5.4753,0.8202,0.4795,6.7311,2.1441,1.2304,3.8441,2.2789,2.3447,4.0059,2.5521,5.3705,2.7984,0.6529,4.2605,1.4997,1.558,3.1325,0.0089,0.005,6.7024,0.6471,0.5294,2.7834,3.4923,0.8484,0.4157,1.6008,5.5873,5.4325,6.768,9.3752,5.0644,0.9939,0.4011,5.1695,6.0622,0.0055,0.0008,0.5264,2.2684,2.2102,3.9555,3.29,4.5635,3.6602,4.2325,3.4412,1.7332,3.3537,1.8333,1.627,3.2508,0.0175,5.4805,4.3569,2.5444,5.4202,0.8952,1.9538,4.5937,2.1209,0.007,10.7303,0.0527,3.0011,2.4556,5.7148,5.2551,2.2547,5.9878,0.0014,1.4134,2.6145,4.1563,4.5314,6.2992,1.459,3.7201,3.2066,1.4925,2.3843,3.235,3.336,1.3252,1.031,0.6692,5.6132,5.1631,3.0888,0.334,0.138,0.2968]}
{"prompt":"The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Canada of 18 fighter jets and other weapons worth an estimated $ 5.23 billion , a Pentagon agency said in a statement on Tuesday .","text":"The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Canada of 18 fighter jets and other weapons worth an estimated $ 5.23 billion, a Pentagon agency said in a statement on Tuesday. The sale was approved by the State Department in a letter dated November 28.\nThe U.S. agreed to sell Canada $ 5.23 billion worth of aircraft and other weapons, according to a statement by a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col Jeff Wright. The U.S. has received approval from the State Department to continue with the sale, said Wright in a statement. The 18 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets and other weapons are part of the $ 33.54 billion deal approved by Congress in August.\nThe U.S. Air Force must still decide to award Canada the military aircraft, Wright said. The deal is expected to be finalized by December 11, the day before the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces the list of weapons that Canada will buy.\nThe deal, however, must still be endorsed by the Canadian Cabinet, which is expected to endorse the deal by Friday. After that, the sale will enter the formal approval stage, before being signed by American and Canadian officials, Wright said. The first part of the deal \u2013 the sale of weapons and training \u2013 is expected to begin later in 2020.\nHowever, since the U.S. is seeking the approval of the State Department on the sale of aircraft only and not the whole deal, it is expected that at least some of the weapons sold by the U.S. will not be ready as planned.\nThis year, Washington has tried to convince Ottawa to wait for the sale of a smaller quantity of fighter jets first. After Canada confirmed that it would seek the entire $ 33.54 billion worth of weapons, Trump signed an executive order on September 21 ordering all sales for the next three years to be suspended or delayed to 2023.\nCanada has requested that the first two ships of the new class be built in Vancouver by Canada\u2019s shipyard, BAE Systems, a British defense company. The vessels would be the first of the six that will be built under a $ 3.5 billion contract. The United States has given Canada the option of buying one of the vessels from BAE Systems at a cost of $1.12 billion.\nAsked by NPR\u2019s John Mapp if he had seen the document, Wright said that the \u201cfull details\u201d of the offer were not yet provided to him. It was not immediately known who, or not, would have the technical expertise to manage the aircraft at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, one of the key elements of the proposed Canadian purchase, Washington has said.\nThe Defense Secretary said that the next 18 months would determine what weapons the deal calls for. Among those are air strikers, air defense missiles, missiles for the United States, but also air defense weapons for other Canadian countries, a defense source said.\nHe also said that the Pentagon had worked out a detailed plan to allow the United States to provide a rapid supply of weapons to Canada. It would involve airlift, ground transport and ground and naval transport, he said.

{"prompt":"A federal judge on Wednesday upheld President Donald Trump \u2019 s pardon earlier this year of 85-year-old former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio , rejecting legal challenges by outside groups . U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton","text":"A federal judge on Wednesday upheld President Donald Trump \u2019 s pardon earlier this year of 85-year-old former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, rejecting legal challenges by outside groups. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in Phoenix said a law barring people from being pardoned by a federal president was constitutional. She gave a favorable ruling to Arpaio \u2019 s lawyers and the National Immigration Law Center. But she told lawyers representing the Justice Department, including former Assistant Attorney General Bruce Lempert, that the government had not proven its contentions. Lempert had sought to stop the President \u2019 s pardon because it would violate a provision in the Constitution barring federal presidents from granting amnesties. Bolton said the restriction on presidential pardons was designed to prevent presidents from circumventing the Constitution by granting unconstitutional amnesties. She said the current version of the law had not been amended since the Constitution was adopted in 1789. It was added to the Constitution to create a constitutional rule that presidents cannot be pardoned for wrongful acts. Bolton said the law was a way for presidents to stop granting unconstitutional amnesties. Bolton said the Supreme Court has twice said the constitutional restriction on presidential pardons is not an unconstitutional violation for the President \u2014 even when someone is guilty of committing a crime that is considered to be as serious as treason. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in Phoenix ruled the president had been given grounds to grant Joe Arpaio a pardon. He had been charged in the 1980s with a number of misdemeanors, which in Arizona are considered far less serious than crimes that carry prison sentences. Arpaio became head of the Arizona Sheriff\u2019s Office in 1973. During his tenure, many Arizonans were arrested and deported for violating immigration laws. Judge Bolton noted the Supreme Court had said it cannot determine whether a particular pardon is unconstitutional because she could not determine what crimes Arpaio was charged with or the sentence he received. However she said the Supreme Court had taken the position that any sentence that is a violation of the Constitution is a \u201c sentence of death \u201d under the law. Arpaio was convicted of several charges including failure to pay a parking ticket for more than two consecutive years and failure to pay a traffic signal violation. Some of Arpaio \u2019 s critics said the Arizona sheriff\u2019s office was guilty of serious misconduct while others said he had done nothing wrong. The National Immigration Law Center, which represented Arpaio, had argued the constitutional restriction on presidential pardons violated the constitutional restriction on making amnesties. The group had argued that allowing the president to pardon Arpaio would make the office of president like the office of a god \u2014 free to pardon anyone, including people who were committing serious crimes. The Justice Department, which represented the Trump administration, claimed that the law was not an unconstitutional law. Trump pardoned Arpaio back in January, ending federal criminal charges against him for illegally keeping a list of immigrants in a private safe in his office. Trump said on Twitter that he was \u201c proud \u201d to have done it. Judge Bolton on Wednesday said Arpaio had not been granted a fair trial by the Arizona Court of Appeals \u2014 which overturned a verdict he had received for violating an immigration law. The judge also rejected claims by Arpaio \u2019 s lawyers that he has not been allowed to obtain a fair trial since being convicted in 2006. Arpaio said he would appeal the court order, telling reporters he was not aware of any court order against him in California or Arizona.

{"prompt":"Mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began , according to official data , dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto s pledge to get gang violence under","text":"Mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto s pledge to get gang violence under control ahead of his October 2018 run-off vote for reelection. Police said the 3,079 homicides in the most violent 10 months in the past 15 years took the previous record \u2013 and still the most in a year \u2013 of 3,086 killings set in 2013.The rise is one of the most marked seen among world- class democracies. And in the run-up to Mr Pena Nieto s next electoral contest, an increase in killings is already making the issue a front and centre for campaigning. But the spike could mean a tough ride out of office for Mr Pena Nieto, who is facing political turmoil and calls for his resignation.Mexica has always been a nation of \u201c violent revolutionaries. In the 19th century, the country was ruled by a succession of \u201cpartisan\u201d governments dominated by the revolutionaries who fought to overthrow the Spanish colonial power. One of the last presidents to serve in the 19th century, Francisco I. Madero, was one such ruler. A former revolutionary and himself killed for taking power in 1910, he led Mexico into an early 20th-century revolution that would ultimately end Spanish rule. Mexican history has also been marked by military coups. A civil war between the governments of President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and Vicente Guerrero ended with the victory of the former. But the two presidents were killed in separate military coups in their turn. And then in 1921, an army generals\u2019 coup landed president Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n at the helm of government. The last civilian to achieve power in the presidency was Joaquin Ortiz, who was elected by the National Assembly in 1994 and reelected in 2000. The United States and Mexico have enjoyed a strong and productive relationship from day one. As our mutual defense and bilateral economic ties have grown, we have also expanded our political and cultural ties. Mr Trump, who took office last month, expressed optimism about his new administration s ties with Mexico and said the two countries would continue to work in the face of Mr Pena Nieto s criticism that he had let the United States down in tackling violence.Mr Trump told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday he was \u201c very pleased \u201d with his new relationship with Mexican President Pena Nieto and that the United States \u201c has been working very hard with Mexico\u2026 We are looking towards a very productive relationship.\u201d But Mr Trump s comments were greeted by disappointment in Mexico. Mr Cruz said Mr Pena Nieto was giving Mr Trump a bad name and that Mr Trump had taken advantage of Mr Pena Nieto to advance his own agenda during the campaign. I m proud to support Mr Trump and the Republican party, but I will not be silent about Mr Pena Nieto s failures in helping bring peace to Mexico. Mr Trump has said he expects a lot of Mr Pena Nieto at the talks with Mr Pena Nieto, which are meant to lead to a new free trade deal between the US and Mexico. Mr Cruz told ABC News on Wednesday that Mr Trump should reconsider before Mr Pena Nieto is sent to Washington. Mr Pena Nieto said on Tuesday that the United States had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d after two U.S. soldiers were killed by Mexican gangs. US officials have said they don t believe that the killing of the soldiers was a result of a government- directed attack.

{"prompt":"The United States is crafting a plan for a drawdown of staff from the American embassy in Havana in response to still-unexplained incidents that have harmed the health of some U.S. diplomats there , U.S.","text":"The United States is crafting a plan for a drawdown of staff from the American embassy in Havana in response to still-unexplained incidents that have harmed the health of some U.S. diplomats there, U.S. officials said on Monday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the United States did not know exactly what types of incidents had occurred, but that those involved in diplomatic relationships cannot just sit back and wait to be told their problems.\n\"We don\u2019t think that diplomats can stand there and wait for somebody to tell them, 'Hey, this and that is wrong' -- that\u2019s what they are charged to do -- and that\u2019s not what they\u2019re supposed to do,\" she said.\nHer comments come after a report by The New York Times citing Cuban officials and diplomats said several U.S. diplomats at the embassy were diagnosed with symptoms of \"poor sleep, frequent headaches, fatigue, frequent urination and irritability in recent months, and some said they are in their mid-50s.\"\nSince April, the embassy has been grappling with incidents that include people crying and screaming and complaining about being stalked by suspicious-looking foreign individuals, and reports that the ambassador has received death threats and attempted suicide attempts. Some U.S. diplomats fear they may be targets because of their past involvement in the so-called \u201cComfort Women\u201d scandal, when thousands of women worked in military brothels for Japanese soldiers.\nThe report quoted a U.S. official as saying that some diplomats thought their superiors weren't doing enough to hold those responsible for the illnesses and threats, but officials at the embassy don't plan to pursue criminal charges if any serious action is taken.\n\"This is a political problem rather than a crime, and if there's even a threat of a crime, that won't be investigated,\" the official said.\nPsaki said the report did not appear to make reference to allegations of sexual assault against some women working in the embassy.\n\"Everything about our foreign policy is transparent, and we make public our efforts to make sure that our workers are working on the basis of safety and well-being.\"\nShe didn't respond when asked whether the report said that some of the illnesses related to substance abuse. That sort of allegation was also raised during a meeting in late June between Washington officials and Cuban lawmakers. That meeting was reportedly conducted in violation of U.S. law, which prohibits the administration from discussing allegations of malpractice involving foreign diplomats with the Cuban side. An official familiar with the matter said the U.S. administration was asked to keep the talks confidential by Cubans.\nA Cubangraphic source said it was inappropriate to discuss the U.S. embassy crisis, in part because \"it has been a year with multiple incidents of that nature, many of them with the ambassador as target\".\nThe New York Times reported last week that the current U.S. ambassador to Cuba, Todd Robinson, is not an experienced diplomat. He was appointed by Obama after the embassy crisis, and he has been unable to travel to Havana since taking his job.

Macron","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron, concerned that a divisive discussion over euro zone reform might undermine his broader European agenda, has begun prioritizing other areas of EU cooperation, French officials say. Macron sought to address France\u2019s anger over the loss of sovereignty by opening an ongoing EU structural reforms debate on the single currency, a long-held French preference. The draft is expected to be discussed at the Council\u2019s informal Summit on Thursday on the margins of the EU summit in Brussels. An aide to the French president told Politico after the meeting that the government supports a plan for a new draft regulation of the Stability and Growth Pact to require that euro zone economies have balanced finances and trade-offs. It will still be up to France, Germany, Spain and other euro zone countries to approve the measures proposed in May 2019, the official said. The proposal is aimed at reducing the burden of debt and stabilizing economies. The draft would ensure that euro zone economies have stable budgets with appropriate macro-prudential tools while also maintaining flexibility to accommodate a potential recession. In addition to the euro zone countries, Macron also wants the draft regulation to include countries from both euro zone and peripheral economies.\nA new global system for measuring emissions could be introduced this year, to replace the current ones on coal and the fuel oil sector to take effect in the second half of 2022, three sources told Reuters. The new emissions system would be a joint effort by the United Nations Climate Secretariat, the International Energy Agency and the World Bank to create a standardized measure for greenhouse gas emissions from global electricity plants, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous for reasons of confidentiality. They said the proposal was being driven by a concern to curb climate change and avoid dangerous interference to the world\u2019s economy, due to trade tensions and worries about the state of the global economy. The United States and many other countries have rejected the framework plan as inadequate and lacking the necessary scientific evidence. The current framework, which measures emissions from power plants at a per kilowatt-hour level, will exit in 2020 and be replaced by one that will use carbon dioxide equivalents, or CO2eq. The new system could also measure emissions from other fossil fuel sources like oil and coal. \u201cThey didn\u2019t work for over 20 years, so the climate community should be focused again on them, and they don\u2019t have to be done by the UN, \u201d said one of the sources, adding it would be better to have \u201cone global system that actually has real value in meeting the goal of limiting global warming to 2 C of warming.\u201d The UN says the current framework, which dates to 1987, fails to provide an accurate picture and could not be used to measure the actual emissions from coal-fired power plants. The proposal would instead involve some global carbon pools to measure the carbon dioxide emitted by coal and other power plants and would be more accurate that those used today, the sources said. While the sources declined to give their names, the UN Climate Foundation \u2013 the nonprofit that is working on the proposal \u2013 said in an email to Reuters that the system will come as part of an overall plan to take the framework to a new level.

The White House has previously said it preferred a 20 percent rate of corporate tax, and the president\u2019s announcement that he\u2019d sign a bill with the figure appears to confirm that preference.\nPresident Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would accept a corporate tax rate of 21 percent and would sign a bill with that number.\nThe White House has previously said it preferred a 20 percent rate of corporate tax, and the president\u2019s announcement that he\u2019d sign a bill with the figure appears to confirm that preference.\n\u201cCongress will get the business tax I want, I expect a low rate of corporate and a big difference between the individual and the business,\u201d Trump told reporters during a visit to the U.S. International Trade Commission. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want any more things.\u201d\nThe Trump administration and Congress have been engaging over the tax issue. The White House wants a higher tax, while Republicans in Congress want a lower tax. The president\u2019s announcement that he\u2019d sign a bill with the proposed number \u2014 not lower corporate tax rates or raising the individual tax rate \u2014 suggests he\u2019s looking at a 21 percent tax rate.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the White House\u2019s announcement should be a big boost to private investment in America. The chamber also called on Congress to adopt any bill that Trump signs that doesn\u2019t end up with an additional 50-billion dollar tax, which would be the equivalent of raising the capital gains tax rate by four percentage points from its current 21 percent to 27 percent for the wealthiest Americans.\nThe president has repeatedly spoken out on the debt ceiling and corporate tax. Trump on Tuesday asked Congress to act and said \u201canything less is just taking money out of their pockets.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said recently that Trump\u2019s preference was for a corporate tax rate of 21%.\nSome have argued that a 20 or 21 percent rate would be a tax victory for the president, particularly as his top priority is cutting taxes for individuals and businesses.\nAt the time of his announcement, Trump was in Texas, holding campaign rallies in communities in northern and central Texas. In his speech in El Paso, Trump talked a little about corporate tax:\n\u201cI think we have to bring back the idea that tax returns are really only a paper obligation to you. You want to know what the tax rate is on your company, well that\u2019s part of your financial responsibility to your company.\n\u201cWe always want to make sure that tax rates are appropriate and it certainly can be a challenge for Congress, especially when you can get a corporate tax rate as low as 5 percent and the individual tax rate as high as 46 percent.

{"prompt":"Former FBI Director James Comey , who was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump , has signed a deal for a book on leadership and decision-making that will come out in spring 2018 , the","text":"Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump, has signed a deal for a book on leadership and decision-making that will come out in spring 2018, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday.\nThe book, to be written by former CIA Director Alexander Downer, will be based on Comey's personal experience and will be published by Penguin Group, the newspaper added. \"The book is coming,\u201d Comey told the Post, adding that he expects it will be released on April 27.\nThe agreement was made in the wake of Trump's firing of Comey on July 25 for refusing to cooperate with President Trump's special counsel, Robert Mueller. Trump accused Comey of having \"zero credibility\" and of failing to do his job properly.\n\u201cI know all about it now. \u2026 I wrote a book on it. It\u2019s coming out April 27,\u201d Comey added.\n\u201cThe book hasn\u2019t been agreed to, not yet,\" the Post reported, adding that the publisher Penguin Group has asked for a five-figure advance.\nIn his resignation letter to the President, Comey expressed \u201cmy unshakable belief that as long as there are reasonable and fair suspicions about any President, any Administration, Congress should be permitted and free to do its job - regardless of the color of the occupant or the colour of the President's skin.\u201d\nComey also criticized Trump for his response to his firing, calling it \u201cnot professional\u201d and adding that he had been under constant threat to his life.\n\u201cThe President seems unwilling to admit that his conduct was wrong but has a problem with the FBI Director revealing what the government believes was accurate information in public, making it look like he was speaking through a straw-man,\u201d Comey told the Post.\nComey later said that although he had resigned, he had also been fired, with Trump having asked him to resign but with Comey refusing. \u201cHe said, \u2018Don\u2019t leave the country so easily,'\u201d Comey recalled telling New York Times reporter Bob Woodward, adding that Trump had called him back and said, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\nFormer Chief Justice John Roberts, who recently resigned from a senior position at the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration has lost \"a moral compass\" on the issue of law-abiding citizens being forced to surrender their records to spy agencies.\n\"When people do things they do not want to do and governments do things they do not want to do, and, yes, there were a few government officials engaged in that now, and the government engages in this kind of conduct, law-abiding folks need to know that they can trust that there is some mechanism we have in place to let them know about whatever they do,\" Roberts told NBC News.\n\"When a government agency says, 'Your information's coming in' or, 'No, here you go,' it's not a conversation. That's not an open process,\" the former justice admitted.\n\"If they're going to act in ways they want to act... they do not have to fear the public's scrutiny. They do not have to fear that we're looking into the conduct and will hold them accountable. But they do need to fear the law-abiding people of this country who are going to be watching their conduct and will act if they find that law-abiding people's privacy is going to be compromised,\" he

John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 both of New York\u2019s largest suburbs \u2014 called for legislation to grant more resources to local law enforcement.\nMcCarty defended New York City, which he said was \u201cbrilliantly, innovatively\u201d fighting crime in the city, but also \u201ccrackling under the pressure of an extreme, unremitting focus on illegal aliens.\u201d\n\u201cThey are a problem for a number of reasons, but our view is that they constitute a security threat to the city,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think people should understand,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026 that there is something going on here, and that it is more than just the crime statistics.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lot to see here and we hope you find something to catch your interest. But we\u2019d much rather you stopped by and let us know what you think and how we can make it better.\nFor just the next few weeks at least, we'll be featuring a selection of interesting articles from our community blog by people like you.\nThe other day, the local CBS 5 news station, covered the issue of local police departments receiving \"special\" donations under the name of \"community spirit.\"\nWe applaud the law enforcement community's efforts in fighting terrorism, but we are concerned it will impact the local community's ability to do their job without the extra resources.\nWe are the leading supplier of AISI 304L Stainless Steel Round Bar throughout the United States on a large size range per weight. Our Stainless 304L stainless round bar has a number of applications in the manufacturing industry. This 304l stainless steel has the ability to resist corrosion from various chemicals and also has a resistance to rusting which makes it a very popular choice for manufacturers of cookware, food and beverage processing equipment, and mechanical manufacturing.\nAISI 303Stainless Steel Rounds from AMSA are available with all lengths up to 48\" with 12mm diameter for sizes up to 40\", and are available in various sizes up to 48\" for sizes up to 40\", and are also available in various sizes up to 48\".ASTM 316 is one of the most common stainless steel alloys in the market.

It is scheduled to take place Monday through Thursday.\nThe trip is part of \u201cregular relations between the Mexican government and the American government, aimed in particular at the welfare and the well-being of the Mexican people,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray will also meet with US Republican Senator Marco Rubio, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Congress. In his capacity as international development commissioner, he will attend the annual meeting focused on international development held in Washington.\nThe visit comes as the administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has sought to distance itself from the controversial Migrant Protection Protocols on \u201cbirthers\u201d. In May, Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s spokesman Alfonso Navarrete said that the president believed the protocols were \u201cfalse rumors and false accusations\u201d created to divide Mexico and the United States. The protocols are based on alleged fake social security numbers of migrants and have caused an impasse that could jeopardize the implementation of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).\nAccording to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray will not visit the US presidential capital this weekend, so he can avoid having to speak out against the \u201cbirther\u201d argument. He will only meet with the Mexican delegation planned to visit Washington next week.\nThe two main candidates in the race to replace Mexican president Felipe Calderon, the former ambassador Sergio Mendez and the former presidential candidate Josefina Velez Rodriguez, have already expressed their support for the Migrant Protection Protocols, which have been criticized by some opposition figures and the media.\nThe Mexican government has said it will support the implementation of all agreements it signs, even those that involve other countries, such as the CETA, even though the protocols have been criticized by critics as illegal.\nIn February, the US Congress authorized a bill giving US officials the right to investigate alleged fraudulent use of the documents by immigrants. The legislation is scheduled to be approved by the US congressional panel by the end of this month. But the proposal has angered the opposition, particularly of the National Action Pact, a conservative political group whose major figure is Sen. Ricardo Anaya. Their allies think that, among other things, the bill threatens the sovereignty and the integrity of Mexico.\nIn a sign that this could be a major thorn in the side of Obama administration, The Washington Post published a leaked version of a memorandum signed by a secret service agent and the Mexican attorney general in charge of immigration. In the document, he says the US intends to \u201cuse these false documents\u201d to \u201cdisrupt the relationship\u201d between Mexico and the United States, among other things.","token_len":713,"entropy":[11.2233,8.2232,8.3945,9.6077,1.7256,5.92,0.2708,0.0006,0.0005,5.3609,3.2987,0.1532,2.4998,1.7918,0.2112,3.0111,0.6072,0.4407,1.1201,0.1424,6.3749,1.8127,1.7554,11.4206,0.2271,0.579,5.974,0.0112,0.0006,0.0256,0.0035,0.0,0.0048,0.5513,0.9178,2.3171,7.4738,0.344,1.9328,1.7008,0.1456,7.3686,2.4683,4.5944,0.0021,1.8675,6.3415,0.4557,7.8856,0.2267,1.3546,2.0073,2.3965,0.2008,0.9641,5.1055,7.0667,2.8189,2.9162,0.2051,1.7027,3.3375,1.5316,1.9088,1.1652,3.8347,0.6699,5.2251,9.2821,0.2688,2.0186,13.8362,2.2554,13.5616,0.0439,4.7947,8.2977,9.8145,4.5331,10.6934,4.1193,0.133,0.6799,0.1837,0.0054,0.003,0.0002,0.0,0.0003,0.0054,0.1491,0.0016,0.0013,0.0193,0.0011,0.0083,0.0008,0.0008,0.0011,0.0003,0.001,0.0009,0.0011,0.0101,0.0004,0.0008,0.0008,0.0,0.0011,0.0015,0.0044,0.0007,0.0015,0.0026,0.0021,0.0011,0.0074,0.0035,0.0028,0.0101,0.0025,0.0928,0.0027,0.0005,0.0006,0.0009,0.0177,0.0,0.031,0.0005,0.0053,7.9511,0.0081,0.0018,0.0025,0.3057,0.0066,0.0005,0.0011,0.0029,0.001,0.0144,0.0026,0.0003,0.0003,0.0169,0.0013,0.0007,0.0004,0.0008,0.0027,2.549,2.5198,3.1093,4.1131,1.7775,2.6435,4.8413,2.1496,1.6266,1.0818,4.5191,1.1085,4.1632,0.3778,1.6528,0.0928,5.2198,3.2127,1.4635,1.5118,2.4755,2.9089,5.0898,1.8553,1.6975,0.0021,13.5058,5.8856,10.9975,8.4698,0.459,0.5237,2.7898,0.3744,0.0983,0.7252,3.9693,1.4982,1.4856,6.7394,5.6902,3.471,0.3938,2.638,6.7324,1.6022,4.7264,3.971,0.1195,0.0002,0.0092,1.8695,2.4428,0.4864,1.1516,8.6051,7.2042,3.1178,4.454,0.2793,0.2045,0.8699,7.2894,0.5945,1.0379,0.0115,0.0001,0.0005,0.7509,2.7898,1.5769,0.2228,3.7229,7.2147,2.4519,1.6838,0.001,1.5132,6.6153,0.0087,0.0873,4.2915,1.199,0.0825,1.8914,0.1233,3.5107,0.0192,3.0987,1.4506,5.3887,2.6815,4.0155,0.0168,7.9068,4.1208,4.6791,0.5459,1.583,0.7533,6.4878,2.2262,3.4228,1.1776,10.193,0.0483,4.0455,1.7976,7.8221,1.0203,1.018,2.4065,0.9608,1.5885,1.9708,2.0911,1.6796,1.2319,4.2727,2.6817,0.4696,1.157,0.2536,0.0,0.0,1.8352,3.6491,0.178,4.7024,0.255,0.0149,1.0231,2.8294,7.4873,0.9706,4.0942,8.4472,4.3608,6.1281,10.9794,1.7663,6.9956,4.338,0.0043,1.3526,2.1472,3.9143,2.4171,3.1205,3.2821,0.3356,1.9057,0.0017,0.0008,8.601,1.8889,0.7092,4.0373,8.8918,0.0127,7.3062,3.3701,0.1092,1.0532,1.2342,1.0701,4.7708,5.2137,1.4325,4.1521,0.8513,7.9361,1.1812,7.6303,10.0241,1.8978,5.3618,2.7625,2.6873,0.598,7.7964,2.2755,4.8059,3.122,1.0118,1.9225,0.6871,0.0006,0.4021,2.6308,4.7413,2.2162,3.3995,0.0465,7.6114,6.7594,7.4492,5.0397,0.3052,3.5717,1.7868,2.3863,4.0128,3.563,3.7054,6.0819,0.0132,4.3849,3.428,4.2305,0.06,0.9982,3.94,0.1094,0.5868,7.2699,2.1164,0.1073,0.058,0.0076,1.0725,0.2313,0.0714,0.6854,0.8215,4.2056,0.0031,1.151,5.595,0.7024,0.5581,0.0107,0.3544,5.5966,0.1607,1.1078,0.0211,0.0002,0.0008,0.6851,4.7093,2.021,0.6926,1.5238,7.3402,5.6909,4.125,3.7415,1.6576,5.7385,1.3365,3.6284,4.1622,3.5464,0.2705,5.831,4.7025,1.3009,0.5085,10.3975,0.6206,2.8692,0.009,0.0004,3.7553,0.3482,9.2877,0.4784,2.6268,0.482,4.0809,1.8943,0.2303,1.9416,2.2586,1.3111,5.8574,0.2207,0.8114,0.4158,0.8545,0.0417,0.3998,0.5789,1.4591,5.462,6.8057,4.5345,2.2348,0.2776,1.6993,2.1893,1.7087,4.682,2.9866,3.1097,0.0007,0.0032,1.0568,2.0635,3.6529,2.2105,6.8787,12.5892,5.8735,1.4263,1.6235,1.492,0.8416,5.4993,0.638,4.5576,4.8636,0.0915,8.8736,0.0598,6.0478,0.4663,1.7854,2.812,3.5192,1.2136,0.9856,0.1353,0.9928,2.4214,0.0263,0.0657,0.1135,0.1464,1.6529,1.3809,2.8527,0.561,2.0314,0.4629,2.8478,5.7133,5.1385,1.871,2.9064,3.0333,0.6333,0.7245,1.6933,2.7629,1.0763,0.9498,3.1675,1.6728,1.3248,3.9984,0.6007,4.3461,0.0297,6.3156,4.3072,4.5678,6.4317,3.2017,3.549,0.9791,0.9737,4.8974,6.3821,0.4403,1.6724,2.2584,0.0012,0.9088,3.8242,0.2343,1.5146,4.2277,1.4782,1.6064,5.0729,1.9238,0.7745,0.8782,0.4137,2.9635,2.367,3.0513,1.0462,0.6933,3.0593,3.4606,0.165,1.1756,2.7836,2.6095,6.1695,2.1391,3.9263,6.5377,3.678,2.8218,1.6685,2.2422,0.0148,4.0189,2.7558,5.7521,5.5967,0.0346,1.9634,6.386,2.2947,5.1816,2.1992,1.5923,2.4213,2.8694,3.9919,0.0901,0.9262,3.264,0.5415,0.3896,1.6357,6.2451,5.1898,3.7925,0.9894,0.0307,0.0005,2.4276,0.6024,0.2329,5.3735,1.4871,4.8816,1.4405,4.904,3.0028,3.5446,1.5979,4.365,5.7421,0.8679,3.5971,1.4366,13.2424,1.2052,1.5336,4.4857,2.5177,1.7184,4.6302,6.525,6.2924,0.8481,7.112,0.0211,4.6778,13.3882,5.4011,1.5778,9.0348,7.0007,6.7403,1.2636,5.0994,5.227,0.1556,0.1531,0.0095,0.4774,1.7168,5.4254,1.5285,3.0945,1.7862,3.5359,3.728,0.0065,2.1402,1.722,0.4564,2.6287,1.8008,4.8612,1.3679,4.1581,3.9198,1.1501,0.8047,2.6504,6.4678,0.1733,0.5325,0.2139,0.0297,6.2363,2.8351,1.6074,4.8442,1.2277,0.1834,2.7966,0.7408,5.5396,4.2602,0.0061,1.52,4.9472,3.1188,0.2018,4.3861,6.4103,4.6968,2.2651,2.5824,3.1527,2.6071,4.3142,0.0195,2.6928,6.484,0.0015,3.3979,2.8769,3.2109,1.0201,2.2682,0.1138,4.797,3.3587,2.3455,2.1278,5.5427,0.0301,9.6633,0.6968,5.5197,5.482,5.7544,1.2243,2.6556,0.4438,0.4332,7.0394,0.1716,4.7373,1.4911,0.9034,6.4052,4.5842,0.4806,0.5284,1.2174,0.0465,0.1532,0.5661,0.0007,1.8102,6.3165,0.0327,0.2592,0.193]}
{"prompt":"Outside the Morgan County fair in McConnelsville , in a rural swath of Ohio that fervently backed U.S. President Donald Trump in last year \u2019 s election , ticket seller John Wilson quietly counts off","text":"Outside the Morgan County fair in McConnelsville, in a rural swath of Ohio that fervently backed U.S. President Donald Trump in last year \u2019 s election, ticket seller John Wilson quietly counts off hundreds of pieces of cash. \u201d This is the least profitable thing i have ever done,\u201d he said. The Trump election helped bring crowds, which helped the Morgan County fair become one of the largest tourist events in the country. This year, the event will bring more than 30,000 people during a seven-day period from Wednesday. Most of what the fair generates comes from people eating at booths and buying products at vendors. But a few hundred dollars a day can be a lot to people who live in the rural area. \u201d It seems silly to put the fair as big as it is for the money we make, but we need to pay the utilities and the salaries,\u201d Wilson said. With the U.S. Supreme Court banning states or federal agencies from regulating the size of the number of political ads permitted on radio or television, voters are increasingly turning to internet ads. In the early hours of the day before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Republican presidential candidate Trump has not yet launched a single radio ad or television ad, despite already owning more than $2 billion in the ad market. Yet the campaign launched a new strategy of using a \u201c big spend \u201d to try and raise money through internet ads. On Wednesday, Trump announced that he would donate $1 million in cash to an online donation campaign, which raises money through the internet. Since the election of President Barack Obama, the Supreme Court has allowed spending money from candidates into online campaign finance fundraisers. \u201c It s really not a campaign, it\u2019s not a political action committee, he said. The Supreme Court s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission of 2012 allowed any American to donate money in support of candidates and political parties. The ruling changed the political landscape in several ways. One of them is that it opened the floodgates to the huge spend on TV and radio ads that is currently underway. If Trump is successful and defeats Joe Biden in the coming election, Republican-controlled states would be able to pass laws or regulations banning online campaigns, such as those that might be seen to have a conflict of interest. On Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida (R) voted in favor of banning political activity across internet platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. \u201c We need to get to the point where we understand that this is an area it s hard for the mainstream news organizations to find because Facebook and Google block and censor information,\u201d Gaetz said. Trump, who has been criticized as having unchecked power as president, is trying to avoid being punished if the Supreme Court rules in his favor. He believes that he will find something to do to prevent internet attacks during the time he\u2019s in office. For his part, Biden called on Congress to pass legislation that would be \u201c extremely difficult to pass\u201d, but said the issue should be studied. He noted that a state law in Georgia allowed for anonymous donations, and said that \u201cwe need a national solution\u201d. \u201d I m not suggesting anonymity for people,\u201d he said. \u201cI m not proposing anonymous donations on a national level. I m proposing more transparency. There are laws in the U.K., the U.S., and we know the potential to do it here.

{"prompt":"A proposed Massachusetts ballot initiative that would allow voters to require U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns cleared a key hurdle on Wednesday , as state lawmakers mulled a similar bill after President","text":"A proposed Massachusetts ballot initiative that would allow voters to require U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns cleared a key hurdle on Wednesday, as state lawmakers mulled a similar bill after President Donald Trump failed to comply with campaign reporting requirements.\nThis month, Massachusetts voters approved a measure that would require the release by political candidates of a public document known as a campaign finance report. Under the proposal, the state Public Service Commission says, officials could also impose a number of new campaign reporting regulations on candidates who decide not to comply with the law.\nIn a letter to the state Commission on Monday, Gov. Charlie Baker, a Democrat, said he would consider adding to the measure a provision that requires statewide ballot initiatives \u201cthat do not constitute amendments to law\u201d to include a \u201csignature requirement.\u201d\nBaker\u2019s proposal would have allowed for signatures on each ballot initiative that require a signature from an elective officeholder and that \u201chas a substantial effect on the constitutionality or validity of any laws.\u201d\nThe proposal was opposed by Republican presidential candidate Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri senator who says Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and conservative commentator Greg Kelly deserve \u201can all day hearing\u201d for their alleged efforts to block Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\u201cThese proposals are a cynical and disingenuous attempt by the left to put out the fires of the Trump impeachment trial with incendiary garbage,\u201d Hawley wrote in a Tuesday statement.\nIn a sign of how far the Trump administration is from complying with campaign finance reporting requirements, the Republican National Committee put out a statement that said it believes Trump\u2019s campaign finance reports are still under review. \u201cThe campaign has not received a full copy of the campaign records,\u201d it said.\nSenate Republicans introduced a bill Monday to give voters an option when asked to vote a constitutional amendment. Instead of voting yes or no to the question, voters would be given the option of either supporting a constitutional amendment or not supporting an amendment (with a blank vote meaning \u201cno comment\u201d on the bill).\n\u201cThis could be a bipartisan bill that has bipartisan support,\u201d Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said in a news conference on his proposal. \u201cAnd then once we vote it, it would be up to the courts \u2014 it would be up to these judges \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to hold the law.\u201d\nIn the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she planned to oppose the measure and said she had no desire to sign off on the bill because the measure \u201cwas not put to the voters.\u201d\n\u201cThe bill could never become law because it was not put to the voters,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cThis is not a good idea.\n\u201cThe best way to do this is for an issue like this to be put on the ballot. It\u2019s a way for us to bring attention to a particular question.\u201d\nSenator Rob Portman, R-Okla., said he would support a proposal by Colorado lawmakers to allow for ballots that go in a separate box, which would go before the voters instead of counting on the outcome of the presidential primary election.

This often comes down to the fact that they lack the experience needed to come up with an idea and find a way to make it work. This is what many people are afraid of, not knowing how to start an online business. In times like these, there are many professionals who can provide the experience and knowledge that you need. Here are the best sources you can use to find a good online business idea.\nThere is no doubt that one of the best ways to find an efficient business idea is to look around for it. This could take a little bit of effort on your part. However, you will get to make a very effective decision if you do it this way. One way to find out about an online business idea is to visit industry events. These industry events are not the only one that can be able to provide you with the most efficient opportunities to get started. You could do a lot better by looking up various companies that provide the services you need.\nYou can get a bunch of information about a couple of online business ideas by reading forums. You can look for ideas in a number of different ways, such as by searching for them, or by reading comments on a couple of posts. However, what you should remember when doing this is that each site is different. This means that what works on one site could not necessarily work on another, which is why you need to take things a little more seriously. One of the only things that will ensure that you get the most efficient ideas is to read a variety of comments.\nOne of the best ways to find out about a business idea is to contact a couple of people in the industry. For starters, when contacting people, you need to be realistic about what your goal is here. If you want to make a business then this is all that you need to do. However, if this is not what you really want then only consider contacting people that you are interested in working with.\nThere are a lot of people out there that offer advice to people regarding different businesses. This is all a matter of luck, it is not always that they are experts. However, you can still get a lot of useful guidance from them. All you need to do is to ask a question, and then find out what different people think about it. Do not be afraid to express your opinions, and you will then get to know more about how to get started with an online business.\nThe government have just revealed their latest predictions for the likely shape of Britain\u2019s population next year, based on a draft census, published by Office of National Statistics.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump began talks with Republican senators on Tuesday to try to build consensus for proposed tax cuts in a meeting that was overshadowed by an exchange of insults between the president and one","text":"President Donald Trump began talks with Republican senators on Tuesday to try to build consensus for proposed tax cuts in a meeting that was overshadowed by an exchange of insults between the president and one of his top advisers.\nSenators from President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party are preparing to consider cutting federal income taxes while they still have the opportunity to do so in 2019.\nTrump had vowed to increase taxes on Americans. The Congress has increased taxes for the wealthy. In Trump\u2019s view, higher taxes on the working poor also benefits them. That\u2019s not because the rich have been stingy and left money in their wills, but because their money is going out to big corporations and the rich have been able to exploit tax loopholes. It\u2019s not about the people.\n\u201cI won\u2019t have a tax cut that is not paid for,\u201d Trump said Tuesday during a presidential debate. \u201cThat\u2019s it. It comes with everything else.\u201d\nThe president believes that his tax cuts would be the biggest individual tax cuts in history. He has said that while some will work, the higher tax rates on the working poor will not benefit anyone except rich and big corporate America. In his mind they are being set up to provide tax breaks to them and then the rich get the windfall.\nTrump and his advisers have convinced the president that a repeal of the ACA and a lowering of the corporate tax rate or even a repeal of it could not be seen as a tax cut. And, in part, because of the tax breaks to the middle class under the ACA, he believes he has never been more popular with the people he says are supposed to be on his side. However, this is only about him and his campaign.\nTrump is one of the most outspoken leaders in the political arena. He is very aggressive on foreign policy. He has also pushed his own agenda. We all heard him say a few months ago on a campaign trip that he was very popular in Iowa and New Hampshire. Most Americans don\u2019t believe that, even as they are seeing how he is pushing his agenda at every turn.\nWhat does Trump get out of his position? He clearly sees political power and how to get power and influence from others.\nTrump isn\u2019t interested in tax cuts for himself, but for those already rich. He wants to lower taxes for them to further benefit companies and wealthy donors.\nTrump isn\u2019t interested in increasing the federal budget or government spending or taking the burden of raising revenues off the shoulders of Americans. He is not interested in raising taxes on income and other items that American middle class families earn, spend and invest in their homes and businesses.\nHe doesn\u2019t need to work for his tax cuts. He can sit on the Supreme Court, spend his time and money going after people he deems unpatriotic and corrupt, and support the policies of his right wing. He can use his considerable influence over the Democratic Party to further his agenda of lowering taxes on the wealthy and those in his party who are already rich. He can, and has. For most of his campaign he has been pushing a Republican agenda that most of his party does not agree on nor support. He won\u2019t have to face a political opposition on a scale never seen in this country since the Second World War.\nThe Republican tax cuts will never go through to the American people, but that doesn\u2019t stop Trump and his supporters from trying again, and

ruined.","token_len":716,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,4.8571,4.5036,1.0001,0.4181,1.5198,2.1332,8.3378,2.2667,4.4693,0.4862,2.3219,19.5548,7.4518,8.6077,3.8139,0.1884,1.5828,2.1172,1.2867,2.8645,1.975,0.0005,0.5017,4.0035,2.8932,0.193,5.9128,3.8677,6.7807,4.255,4.7362,2.5012,1.6937,2.5399,2.1636,6.4274,3.3154,1.8422,1.4783,0.2437,4.1913,2.4902,2.8133,0.0462,0.424,2.7693,13.8443,2.027,16.2715,4.5966,7.0848,5.9763,3.9076,3.4462,4.9036,6.7779,6.6998,1.8209,12.7172,4.7147,1.0661,1.7271,0.2632,0.0254,4.5608,2.4063,0.9367,0.3776,3.5642,2.3345,2.754,2.722,1.617,0.2321,0.0149,3.3384,0.783,6.5398,3.5725,2.5273,0.0867,2.7915,1.5713,0.1446,1.4386,6.1678,4.97,1.6504,1.8243,2.2883,0.4479,2.2777,4.7309,2.848,3.7555,1.5528,6.0695,3.6671,1.0794,8.3651,1.4314,4.3649,2.4921,3.9256,3.9517,0.3715,1.0563,2.3016,1.3797,2.779,1.5534,3.4915,1.5795,0.1558,0.9707,4.8879,3.5028,1.2903,3.977,4.5223,0.14,0.5405,2.5142,2.1953,0.9443,0.3768,0.3908,4.3376,0.1703,2.26,5.6254,5.4783,4.0744,2.7747,2.1657,4.5405,8.6181,1.73,3.6999,2.5202,0.9028,0.5215,0.0193,7.1343,2.0608,2.5144,0.9823,1.2329,2.1473,2.6776,2.2207,3.7797,4.2856,1.5064,1.7217,1.4503,1.217,2.497,2.5742,0.2244,0.0109,0.8192,0.1061,0.0111,1.9029,1.4191,2.4589,0.2247,0.0745,0.1169,6.3732,0.6971,1.6625,0.4873,6.1306,2.6881,0.1955,1.2244,4.1929,2.2563,0.4216,0.8312,1.9067,4.2362,1.6426,1.2423,1.8761,1.8803,3.2588,2.7516,1.789,3.2008,0.0593,5.4296,0.1971,2.0307,1.6914,7.5066,0.6226,2.8326,0.6586,2.0172,0.3632,1.1805,3.3061,0.0629,2.0777,1.1602,1.4499,0.1471,0.181,0.0304,0.371,0.03,0.5901,0.2937,1.0466,3.7197,4.9097,1.6449,0.0644,0.1281,0.6172,1.369,3.7599,4.3444,3.0673,0.2241,1.5968,6.1694,0.1246,0.0848,0.7298,5.7868,4.5077,1.4567,3.1028,5.8105,1.6322,1.6614,1.0471,0.9886,0.8425,1.7766,0.5241,3.9534,2.9037,3.1317,1.6883,0.2825,1.2272,3.6202,0.3467,1.7785,1.5533,0.3232,3.8316,5.2711,1.4804,2.639,1.7233,3.3983,5.1967,3.4032,1.2175,7.0471,0.6513,4.5054,3.8072,13.0049,1.3292,0.3397,4.8134,1.6684,6.9595,1.5075,1.0791,1.5467,4.6893,0.9646,3.3964,4.7101,4.0927,1.4685,2.4935,1.6008,0.1184,3.9359,0.9174,0.7265,0.6997,6.1956,5.7668,0.4269,2.9021,2.5197,3.8136,0.0012,0.9511,0.3038,1.2383,6.7972,4.272,2.2647,1.6505,5.2392,0.762,5.8219,1.9618,1.0786,3.7355,4.1651,1.3803,1.4897,5.3302,2.6417,3.7169,2.6677,3.0882,3.7711,1.5072,7.4944,8.4182,3.9132,2.8731,1.908,5.5276,1.6678,3.5078,5.8144,1.3868,2.9467,6.2164,1.6699,0.358,4.2714,1.8822,5.773,1.075,3.3075,1.4742,2.6648,2.1198,3.3029,2.5847,4.4906,1.5462,1.0461,1.3236,5.2025,3.4087,4.0021,1.5226,2.9598,0.9475,3.6985,0.5869,3.2377,3.0413,3.9736,0.0256,5.182,1.9978,0.7111,1.0018,3.3806,4.6255,1.6301,2.0389,6.6611,2.6475,1.6323,0.3911,4.1302,3.9341,3.0081,3.1644,4.3465,0.2907,1.7587,2.5471,0.7097,6.2529,2.4849,5.3481,7.1236,5.3231,5.0606,1.3737,0.2921,5.4146,0.0118,1.6473,3.1169,0.7137,4.309,0.4641,2.2283,1.5311,3.3583,2.8831,2.7978,7.3681,0.3197,4.0045,0.5111,2.0085,1.7038,1.0579,0.8483,4.9827,4.2162,1.2845,0.3306,1.7072,2.7003,5.0406,0.6857,4.3797,3.5129,0.5486,0.8466,1.9936,5.9261,0.9067,2.9261,2.1012,0.8115,3.8879,0.9902,0.9194,3.6294,5.1556,0.6223,4.9901,1.0012,4.2385,7.5903,1.8708,6.7474,5.8187,3.1727,4.4599,1.6743,3.9395,2.7621,5.3866,3.2782,5.6382,6.6076,0.55,2.4581,5.0208,0.97,2.1463,1.4655,0.0714,3.4482,3.5322,0.9035,3.171,0.9558,2.1255,0.7324,5.0059,4.5419,1.6384,6.661,0.0659,1.029,3.4489,1.2135,1.1258,0.8379,3.3881,1.3901,3.6424,4.4129,4.5317,3.8494,2.9675,1.0667,4.6627,1.0579,3.7777,5.3154,0.9802,5.49,0.1227,5.0637,1.2611,0.3569,4.1448,0.6169,1.3684,1.2733,2.0904,2.3264,8.7042,2.5884,4.9834,0.1191,7.4507,2.0795,0.2798,0.734,0.2238,3.3541,0.5926,1.3485,0.3372,2.7493,1.106,2.2279,1.8219,2.0793,6.7014,1.233,1.644,0.4044,3.1749,0.8151,0.5733,2.2476,3.2354,3.2031,0.0243,0.7012,3.3464,4.833,2.8479,0.4198,1.9698,0.2672,2.0157,1.7157,1.9538,5.9624,1.4731,6.3256,1.0545,0.2728,0.8899,1.701,1.8045,0.7054,1.0223,0.8289,1.2538,0.2098,3.2957,0.6562,3.3355,4.8173,2.4032,1.7587,4.6236,3.7713,0.3923,2.0649,2.0229,3.2768,0.0698,2.4879,1.6137,0.2143,3.6966,0.4336,0.323,2.092,5.2151,5.1811,0.0015,5.1067,0.3073,2.8005,7.1348,0.3691,3.5463,0.3742,0.2541,3.1599,1.5696,5.9073,2.9332,3.5728,3.9078,2.4201,5.6036,3.5234,0.7738,0.4895,4.4117,2.5746,1.159,5.7344,2.7771,0.7852,0.0991,5.7748,1.3911,1.0161,1.3971,2.2137,2.4637,4.2143,4.9125,0.4412,6.8625,0.0305,3.3362,0.724,3.6564,0.89,3.8575,1.9042,0.1437,2.5254,0.8569,5.0258,1.8948,2.531,2.001,3.6458,3.0943,0.9286,2.1962,2.2017,2.1056,0.5443,2.781,1.1142,3.781,0.2813,2.4696,1.0424,3.6249,3.4575,2.0363,2.7237,6.7139,1.1947,6.5881,3.8615,0.6512,3.334,1.4203,0.0859,3.6501,1.0675,1.8594,2.2256,1.8137,0.0572,0.2461,2.3178,1.0416,10.6699,2.5642,1.9543,2.8158,1.9152,1.2595,6.2905,6.8163,0.0031,8.2316,5.5231,5.4466,1.1063,1.9694,4.0871,0.7355,4.4706,0.4812,0.2672,3.2612,0.2448,0.6587,0.2887,3.1659,0.3655,1.2379,0.5059,1.02,2.8169,0.9082,0.8446,1.1891,1.8143,0.8364,2.2549,2.3824,6.3798,0.5255,1.1842,0.5351,1.6968,3.0993,4.3519,6.3049,0.6756,2.1191,1.7432,2.98,1.0494,2.6724,1.1762,0.4679]}

It could provide direct and direct-to-consumer advertising and marketing campaigns that raise millions of people\u2019s awareness of abortion as a legitimate health care option, which would likely reduce the number of people who seek an abortion in the first place. The N.Y. Times reported earlier this week Planned Parenthood announced it intends to cut $2.\nThe White House says it will defend a key part of the government\u2019s controversial health care law, a plan to stop taxpayers from paying to subsidize a number of abortions in a major U.S. state. The administration, in a document filed last week to defend itself against a lawsuit filed by more than 18 states that have opposed the taxpayer-supported abortions, says the Affordable Care Act gives states a range of options to provide Medicaid tax assistance. But it says taxpayer money has not been used to help people.It is true that states.\nA recent study of nearly 3 million high school seniors published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the more a high school student lives in a household with a mother who received a college degree, the more likely she is to have received a college degree herself at some point in her life. The study, the largest analysis of its kind, found that nearly all girls and most boys living in households with college-educated mothers were more likely to pursue college, and many of those who did not go to college eventually attended the private market. Even though college attendance for the overall population dropped in 2014 compared to the previous year, it.\nPresident Donald Trump and President Barack Obama had more in common than many people realize. During Trump\u2019s second campaign season, the president repeatedly took aim at Obama and his presidency, using the current president as a pawn in his political campaigns. In fact, Obama had one of his many moments of political courage in his 2010 farewell address to the nation. In an unmitigated political display, Obama said: \u201dMy greatest regret is that despite all the lessons we learned then and all the progress that we have made since, we\u2019ve gone from.\nIt was nearly 20 years ago that I first read about an idea that would eventually make its way into my life \u2014 and into my office.In 2000, I was living in Florida, my fianc\u00e9 was studying to be an

The paper suggests that because men are more intelligent, they are more competitive and less comfortable having a social life with other people, the Daily Mail reported.\nI was born in Canada. Now I live in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. For me, I think that men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing are great and I don\u2019t have a preference as to gender. I like the casual clothing and the fashionable clothing, so I don\u2019t have any preference.\nMy name is Sadia, I\u2019m 25 years old, currently living in Dubai.

I thought a quick post might be nice to share the kind of vintage shop that we frequent in Brisbane and just up the road at Duncairn in the Darling Downs. I\u2019m not sure if the name of it is the same as the one I visited last time, but the store is just called Vintage World! We\u2019ve been going to see what\u2019s new for a few weeks now and there\u2019s always a new collection on display, so there\u2019s been quite the range on display. And, this time they had a huge selection of ladies clothing! I have to admit that I have been buying lots of women\u2019s clothing on my travels. I have to find out where they can find the best women\u2019s clothing on the street to enjoy, but I still end up shopping for myself. So, this time was no different!\nI have seen dresses on display that I could have bought for my daughter! I also saw some really great dresses that I could have bought for myself! I think I have to mention that the clothes and some jewellery were very affordable too! A lot of the items were in nice condition and would also look great just worn as-is.

We re not moving","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday told dozens of world leaders and company bosses gathered at a climate summit in Paris that we are losing the battle against climate change. We re not moving fast enough, he said, and the damage is already in evidence.\nHe called for governments to put a tighter cap on greenhouse gas emissions than any previous international agreement in an effort to keep the world from rising above 2 C, the temperature at which global warming has shown the potential to trigger dangerous and irreversible changes, and the only level deemed safe by the world s climate sceptics.\nAsked to justify the need for an accord that places a very modest increase on the temperature he sought to limit, Macron said the world was not yet on the right slope in its fight against climate change, as opposed to climate sceptics who were not just advocating a return to the preindustrial world.\nHe said this was the moment to rethink an industrial model that had proved so destructive in many ways, with global manufacturing, including some of those in Europe, relocating to other parts of the world at the cost of increasing pollution. The EU, he said, had an obligation to lead in this fight.\nThe French president was speaking to more than 200 representatives at the third World Economic Forum s Climate Change Adaptation summit, which was co-hosted by the French foreign ministry with the UN. He spoke at the beginning of the two days of plenary meetings, which follow the official discussions among senior officials responsible for matters such as sustainable development.\nClimate conference summit in Paris France to get'strong' goals on climate change\nBut it is very important to focus on the small things, to not lose focus when we talk about the big things, he said.\nMacron also asked participants to look closely at the science. He acknowledged that at times there had been problems with the way scientific findings were made and released.\nThe science had been, he said, the source, in some cases, of considerable disquiet and the source of a sense of panic in some of our countries, but he didn t deny that it had also contributed to the progress made since the beginning of the century towards a response to climate change.\nThe summit, Macron said, also presented countries a chance to work together on the big ideas, such as the green deal, green economy and global partnership.\nThey needed to see us working together, creating our own opportunities, pushing our own systems, and using our own strength for a cause that was ours. And this is what Europe has to demonstrate, he said. It must be a place where we work together for a common goal, he said, and not only within the EU.\nBut that will take time, and perhaps not always be enough, he said. As with many other issues that impact on our country, there will be disagreements, which is the price we pay.\nMacron also suggested that the next generation could step in as a solution for the challenges facing the world, and not just the generation that was already here, and that had been facing the same challenges in the past.\nIt has been an amazing experience for me this past week, and I think to myself, hey, maybe we can do a little bit each day, a little bit.

Trump told reporters during a campaign stop in Minnesota. \u201c I think that we\u2019ve made a great deal and we\u2019re going to make a great deal with Malaysia\u2026\u201d Trump described the talks between his administration and Najib Razak as \u201cvery, very important. \u201c It will be great for us, it will be great for them, it will be great for Malaysia and great for Japan.\u201c \u201d He said, \u201cThe plan is for the Japan\u2014 the plan is for Japan to be the major trading partner of Malaysia,\u201d including with the United States when that deal happens. \u201cI think that that will be great\u2026and I hope to do that very soon.\u201d Trump has long looked like the next president of the United States, and Malaysia, a strong ally in Asia, needs the US as much as the Malaysian people do. Trump\u2019s comments appeared to come after Najib said he and Trump had discussed a deal to buy some of Boeing\u2019s jets and other aircraft, and that the Americans were more interested in buying the planes than buying the defense and cyber capabilities the United States gave to Malaysia.\nNew Study Reveals New COVID-19 Outbreak in Nursing Homes New Study Reveals New COVID-19 Outbreak in Nursing Homes\nThe researchers used a questionnaire to assess risk factors of COVID-19, blood specimens for testing and specimens from nasal swabs for tracking the virus.\nThe findings showed that a high percentage in nursing homes with known cases of coronavirus or COVID-19 had the highest number of reported cases of COVID-19. In most nursing homes, a high rate of reported cases was correlated with a high rate of positivity.\nOne of the largest outbreaks studied was in Nursing Home #7 in New York City with a reported 1,260 new cases of covid-19, or 27 percent of all positive patients, the researchers reported. That is the largest outbreaks identified to date for which all tests have been completed. This report comes on the heels of the new data that shows that people with diabetes are three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than people without the condition. (Read more here.)\nA report from the CDC says that COVID-19 may present differently in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its first official advisory on COVID-19 and elder care facilities, advising healthcare providers and caregivers on the diagnosis and treatment of elderly persons with the virus.

The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\n\u201cThe United States, and by extension Europe, will never again tolerate the murder of innocent civilians. These people in Syria do not deserve to be murdered in such vile, barbaric fashion. We will do all in our power to aid and defend the families, women and children, as well as ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous acts are brought to justice and those responsible punished. We are not going to let the terrorists win,\u201d Trump wrote.\nThe Twitter account of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron went on to express a similar sentiment,\n\u201cWe must condemn and reject any form of violence and will do all we can to support the suffering children, families and communities affected by these terrible attacks. Every means is being used to provide aid. We will be there for our people as they must be there for ours.\u201d\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani also condemned the attack in Syria, tweeting,\n\u201cI condemn the bomb explosion that happened in Damascus. It killed innocent civilians. No one should have to face this kind of violence and terror. We must ensure that those responsible for it are prosecuted:\n\u201cThe Iranian nation stands alongside all of our friends, governments and people at this terrible time.\n\u201cWe pray for the victims and their families.\u201d\nTwitter users, both Western and Asian, reacted to the bomb blast in Syria, and urged the Iranian government to do all it can to find those who perpetrated the attack.\n\u201cThis bomb attack must be brought to public attention. I think Iranian authorities are in this too. The people of Iran deserve to know what happened and why,\u201d a Twitter user commented.\n\u201cIt is shocking, especially with the ongoing terror and bloodshed in Syria. We should have all this in record & must be seen to be getting on with matters, not hiding & hoping for better days to come in the future. Those responsible must be charged,\u201d read another tweet.\nA third added\n\u201cIt is so appalling to see innocent lives being lost in such a vicious attack, and many innocent lives should be spared. We hope Iranian authorities will do everything they can in order to find the perpetrators and prevent the attacks of this kind in future.\u201d\nA source who had come to Iran for the New Year said the blast was not an improvised bomb but was connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u2019 intelligence units.\n\u201cThere was a major security scare within this area. They think there was a bomb thrown in the air in the area near the synagogue in the morning of yesterday,\u201d the official said, adding that security forces were investigating the incident.\nA senior official in the Iranian army intelligence unit said that the Iran-Iraq border in west of Karbalaa had been taken care of by the military intelligence unit and all roads had been monitored by the army intelligence unit.\nOne resident, who said he spent the New Year\u2019s Eve in the city, said security forces had visited the synagogue in the morning, notifying the mosque to prevent

{"prompt":"President Emmanuel Macron , visiting Algeria , said on Wednesday he would not be held hostage by France s colonial involvement there and urged young Algerians to build for the future and not dwell on","text":"President Emmanuel Macron, visiting Algeria, said on Wednesday he would not be held hostage by France s colonial involvement there and urged young Algerians to build for the future and not dwell on the past.\nMacron, a French Socialist presidential hopeful, said there were no wartime crimes of the French against Algeria that warranted reparations.\nFrance, along with many other European countries, has argued that its colonial involvement in Algeria since World War II caused significant human rights violations and damage to the culture of the country, calling for reparation.\nBut Macron, in the course of his visit, repeatedly said the Algeria he is about to visit as leader of France s EU presidency would never demand reparations from Paris.\nHe went on to say that Algeria would try to make Paris pay a fair price for its involvement.\n\"I m not asking the Algerian government today to go to war on the French, the Algerian people and the Arab world, but I m not going to be held hostage by France, \" Macron told Algerian television.\nMacron, France s candidate to become president in last Sunday s elections, said he would speak openly about Algeria for the first time.\n\"What could I have said in 2000 to explain the Algerian people today who want a modern relation with France?, he said.\n\" It ( last s) will be a very frank and very honest reflection.\nIf I don t come to be president of France, what will France have to say now, in a fair way and without misunderstandings, to Algeria and the Arab world? \"\nMacron had previously said France and Algeria would have an \" honest \" relationship.\nDuring his visit to the Algerian capital on Tuesday, he said he wanted to \" understand the Algerian history, its recent history, our relations with Algeria in the years that have followed independence, the hopes that the Algerian people have for tomorrow, the expectations that they have in particular for the EU that they hope will come to them, but also in terms of a European future and a European identity.\n\"I mean without misunderstanding and without having to look back, but in the perspective of our common future, \" he said.\nMacron arrived in Algeria on Wednesday to the backdrop of an ongoing national debate about the future relationship between the two countries since French colonial rule ended.\nIn his opening remarks on Wednesday, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika called for greater economic exchange between the two countries and encouraged Macron to pursue European integration.\nHe accused Macron, during the campaign for election this week to be President of France, for criticising the Algerian struggle of independence from France in the past.\nBut Macron said there was a need for greater interaction between Brussels and Algiers.\n\"This is why I have come here in my capacity of president of the EU and to discuss the future of Europe with President Bouteflika.\nWhat we need is a Europe that is more than its borders, \" he said.\nMacron was accompanied by several senior French diplomats and businessmen.\nHe was also accompanied by a delegation of representatives of businesses in France with investments in Algeria ranging from tourism to energy and transport.\nMacron is due to travel to the Islamic country of Tunisia on Wednesday, where he will meet King Mohammed VI and attend an

{"prompt":"A fire in a southern neighbourhood of Beijing early on Wednesday killed five people , the Chinese government said , just weeks after another deadly blaze in the city prompted a crackdown against migrant workers","text":"A fire in a southern neighbourhood of Beijing early on Wednesday killed five people, the Chinese government said, just weeks after another deadly blaze in the city prompted a crackdown against migrant workers with no access to basic facilities.\nChina has banned live chicken imports from Canada because of fears the virus may have spread inside those birds, a spokesman for the Bureau of Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection said Monday. \u201cCanada has no history of H5N1 avian influenza, so the risk to animal and people is very low,\u201d said Wu Qian, adding that the outbreak has not spread to other provinces and that the China CDC is now tracing the possible source of the chicken, which arrived by sea at a Beijing dockyard on June 18. China has found five poultry farms with H5N2, another avian strain, according to Chinese media, a day after a third poultry farm was confirmed with H5N1.\nThe Chinese government said Tuesday it has stopped imports of live birds and poultry products from at least four European countries as part of a major security check to protect the country from a deadly bird flu virus that has already swept through several countries in Asia.\nA U.S. state court ordered China to take action to halt live bird exports on Monday, two days after the latest outbreak of bird flu there. U.S. plaintiff David Eichstut, chairman of U.S.-based animal welfare group PETA, sued the province of Fujian, south China, and three companies that export live birds to the United States and Canada. They said the company's policy of disinfecting export goods with ammonia was insufficient to combat the virus, which has killed thousands of birds, mostly chickens, in China.\nThe government has not shut down trade in birds and the country is still importing birds from Canada, the United States, Japan and Hong Kong, said Wu Qian, government spokesman. The ban on live birds comes just days after the government said it was cracking down on businesses that are selling chickens that are infected with H5N1, the strain of bird flu that originated in Asia, but has also sickened and killed millions of birds outside of Asia.\nThe government of the United States\u2019 most populous state, New York, issued the most severe animal quarantine restrictions for live birds ever ordered by the health agency in the state. In his ruling, Judge Matthew J. Snyder\u2019s order requires \u201ccomplete and total\u201d shutdown of live bird exports to and from Canada and the U.S.A.\nThe outbreak in Canada comes as live bird sales have continued in China, despite fears of a bird flu outbreak in the country. China still imports chicken and geese from Canada, as well as turkey from the United states, Japan, Italy and Denmark. However, live poultry imports may continue in small amounts, as these countries do not have a history of the H5N1 avian influenza, the official Xinhua news agency reported on the weekend.\nA group of U.S. activists have filed a lawsuit on the grounds of animal cruelty against the Chinese government over the coronavirus quarantine orders.\nIn an interview with RT, Yaroslav Tishchenko, spokesman of

{"prompt":"A congresswoman in Peru said embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski survived a vote in Congress to oust him by promising some opposition lawmakers that he would pardon the country s jailed former authoritarian leader ,","text":"A congresswoman in Peru said embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski survived a vote in Congress to oust him by promising some opposition lawmakers that he would pardon the country s jailed former authoritarian leader, according to local media. Democratic Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori said on Friday that Kuczynski had promised her he would pardon Alberto Fujimori, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations and corruption during his time as president, The Peruvian government s opposition-controlled Congress is in turmoil as the parliament failed to resolve the impasse over the motion of censure, citing different levels of voting. Congress also approved on Thursday the resignation of three government ministers and a draft law to dissolve Congress. Fujimori is a former star actress who turned to politics in the aftermath of the 2011 bloodless military coup that ended the authoritarian rule of Alberto Fujimori. She remains head of a center-right party, though it has slipped from power in Peru. She received backing from Peruvian citizens on her Facebook page, while the opposition lawmakers' own Facebook pages were flooded with hundreds of thousands of people demanding their resignations, Fujimori said, per Agence France-Presse. \" I will fight to regain my parliamentary seat because the people have not lost faith in my promises and in my actions,\" she wrote. In addition to Kuczynski s ouster, it seems in some ways the parliament is trying to save and preserve the democratic institutions, and with this crisis it will be resolved. We will have a new parliament and a new president - this should not be seen as the end of democracy because of the crisis, she added. Kuczynski, who lost the presidency to his center-left rival Ollanta Humala on December 9th after a congressional vote of censure over a graft accusation against his former friend and business associate, resigned as president. But the former politician remained as a congressman, and his resignation was not voted on, the newspaper El Heraldo reported. Fujimori, who lives in self-imposed exile in Spain after her release from prison in 2019, also remains a lawmaker. She and her party declined to comment, a spokesperson did, per TV Newsline. But the opposition said that they would be meeting on Friday morning to discuss a response and the need to force Kuczynski to resign, per La Razon newspaper. The congress passed a motion of censure against Kuczynski in a vote of 61 to 29 on Wednesday. It accused him of being part of a fake business group, allegedly linked to his son, and of trying to undermine the judicial system to protect his relatives, according to the newspaper El Comercio. The government has denied taking any illegal actions, the newspaper reported. On Wednesday, the prime minister appointed new ministers, including Foreign Minister N\u00e9stor Popolizio, according to El Comercio. The newspaper had reported that the deputy attorney General of Peru Alejandro Neyra would be the new justice secretary. According to El Comercio, the opposition said that they planned to discuss whether to follow the opposition party s tradition of presenting a new draft law to disband Congress at their next meeting., according to El Comercio.

{"prompt":"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) head Scott Pruitt is said to have taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid-February , costing taxpayers more than $ 58,000 , the Washington Post","text":"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) head Scott Pruitt is said to have taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid-February, costing taxpayers more than $ 58,000, the Washington Post reported Thursday.The EPA has spent over $ 10 million to lease small private jets over the past five years, according to records kept by the EPA under Senate rules.The travel comes under scrutiny following reports that Pruitt flown from the White House three times while working for a private company that works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in order to fly with his family on Air Force One and the military, as well as take private flights to his home on Lake Havasu.The flights have been paid for by the EPA, using a program that gives travel for non-business trips to employees working for a taxpayer-funded agency.Pruitt's flights are separate from those under a program established in 2013 that allows private-sector employees, including the EPA's, to use the aircraft for work as long as they return to the office and are not given travel money.The program, which initially drew heavy criticism for giving too much power to the EPA, was later tightened, including reducing the number of times employees can use the program and restricting the types of air travel.The Post cited records showing a payment from the EPA to Pruitt for two travel flights that took place after the agency's top official was confirmed as EPA head.The first flight to Hawaii took place on Feb. 3, about three weeks after Pruitt was confirmed by his Republican successor to the job, Rona Cooper, as the agency's chief executive.The second flight to Phoenix, Ariz., to visit the Air Force base where his wife was stationed on Jan. 30, 2020, was paid a total of $7,200, while four flights in February paid $6,900.The EPA has been criticized for using taxpayer money to give a top official free flights to his home on the western edge of Phoenix.Pruitt's first flight to Phoenix from the White House was on Feb. 23, 2020, one day after President-elect Joe Biden was sworn in. He flew to Arizona for an all-day meeting with Air Force officials on a military base where his wife was stationed.Biden was sworn in at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., a short distance away from where Pruitt has been given at least four flights with his family since President Donald Trump left office the previous week.Pruitt and his colleagues have been accused of violating the separation between the public and private sectors through the use of this program to take private flights to a remote location and not return to Washington.The Air Force's spokesperson, Major General Scott Schilling, told the New York Times that Pruitt was not on the base for a meeting or presentation but was part of a tour of the base by a private entrepreneur.Schilling also said that his organization has \" zero tolerance \" for employees using taxpayer funds for personal pleasure, adding that Pruitt never arrived in Hawaii with the Air Force.The Post reported that Pruitt \" planned to fly the same trip \" with his family to the Pentagon for an event with military leaders, as well as in December.Pruitt's office did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.EPA employees who took part in the $ 7,000 flights in February were the agency's Director of Air Quality and its director for research programs.The EPA did not provide travel details for all the remaining flights, but it is understood that they took place prior to Mr. Biden taking

Tillerson and Russian Foreign","text":"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has the unenviable task of exploring U.S.-Russian cooperation following Washington \u2019 s latest sanctions on Russia and Moscow \u2019 s expulsion of U.S. diplomats. Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov have met in Geneva to discuss the crisis and other regional issues, but Tillerson is seeking progress beyond reinvigorating the Obama administration\u2019s \u201czero option\u201d plan, which involves sanctions on arms imports and other targets, and would leave the door open for an eventual arms freeze.\nTrump \u2019 s economic policy has a long history, and it includes the protection of U.S. businesses and the national interest. In the wake of the latest U.S. trade tariffs against Chinese goods that hit $34 billion of Chinese imports, and the planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that are expected to hit as high as $11.5 billion in steel and $28 billion in aluminum, the White House is preparing to implement new U.S. tariffs on another $34 billion of imports.\nWe live in a time when the world is facing a major challenge of understanding whether it can ever achieve sustainable development. As a result, the development of a theory of sustainable development should go beyond the traditional narrow interpretation of the concept, taking into account the new realities of today. (Author's abstract)\nIn order to get all the details in the latest version of the DOE software, we must run the dakota.exe script which is in the \/bin folder. A good resource on how to do this can be found here. Running python dakota.exec will allow you to download the latest version of the DOE software and the dakota.log files that contain a lot of useful information about the process. This has the advantage that the python script can use almost any version of the dakota.exe and therefore can be used for years.\nOne of the most powerful methods of social engineering is through email (e-mail, of course, is not just for social engineering \u2014 it also contains information regarding financial activities, including social engineering. ). In a recent investigation into a number of suspected phishing campaigns, it was found that criminals typically use email as the first step in the process of obtaining personal information.\nThe most common form of phishing is through emails, where the fraudster uses a personal name of an individual who is well known, and pretends to be from a company (i.e. Amazon, AT&T, etc.). The first step to the fraud is to obtain a personal email account.\nThe phishing emails include a company\u2019s logo and an automatic reply from the target\u2019s administrator, asking the recipient to click on a URL address to update the account (the URL address includes a malware embedded within it and the attack is very often successful ). Since the emails often arrive at users\u2019 accounts because of an anti-virus service that the user set, criminals use a script to perform this task automatically.\nTo test the method, click the link you received in the email and you will be taken to a page asking you to enter your personal information. Do not enter the personal information to confirm the authenticity of the account.

The","text":"Lobbyists and Republican lawmakers are gearing up for battle over a new U.S. regulation that is likely to dent profits in the $ 6 billion short-term, high-interest \u201c payday \u201d loan industry. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is poised to vote against a rule passed by the Federal Reserve on May 25 that is meant to curtail \u201c unlawful \u201d and \u201c predatory \u201d lenders who provide short-term loans to cash-strapped customers at a rate as much as 300 per cent.\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payday financing can lead to debt that is impossible to repay. In a statement released Monday, the agency says, \u201c predatory short-time period lenders have actually exploited an unregulated market that is growing to satisfy the financial requirements of clients with low incomes, causing debt that is often unsustainable and sometimes even threatening to lead to bankruptcy. \u201d The FDC has already ordered the payday loan provider Paycheck Protection Program, that would have provided $ 900 million per year in direct loans to companies with small payrolls, to eliminate this service and products. The agency wants another $ 300 million for the business, which the Center for Responsive Politics estimates ended up being among the top 20 loan providers in 2012. Payday cash loan provider Advance America claims to have created a $ 24 billion industry.\nThe Senate has passed a payday-lending law that would allow smaller business and neighborhood organizations to run payday financing, according to a person familiar with a draft legislation that has passed.\nThe pay day loan industry says it could end up being a small business as small as a drive-by lender, enabling the neighborhood group to pick up the slack in serving the financial requirements of those coping with little earnings. But opponents of the legislation state some businesses would create more competition, placing customers and neighborhood organizations in their path of danger.\nThe payday loan industry isn\u2019t without its critics. Some believe it is unfairly and unfairly providing small, high rates of interest to people that are otherwise credit-deficient. The Bureau of Justice statistics show that the standard payment on a $ 750 loan can equate to $ 1,000 over 15 years. It is comparable to a $ 20 billion deposit account for someone with bad credit to get a house, if their credit rating didn\u2019t permit them to receive a $ 25,000 down payment.\nIn addition to the $ 300 million from the FDC plan, the Paycheck Protection Program also included $ 50 million through the Small Business Administration to permit lenders to pay back payroll costs, as well as a $ 1.5 million grant that could be used for advertising expenses by neighborhood organizations providing payday financing.\nSenate Finance Committee chairman Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said late Monday night he and co-sponsor Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) want to complete the legislation this week. He stated that after a number of hours last Monday, both had decided they would like to have the vote by May 20th. The committee is expected to vote on the bill this week, possibly Wednesday evening.\nPayday loans are usually short-term loan made to bridge budget gaps because of the cost of living can get high.\nThese loans are supposed to be repaid with added interest, therefore they are a form of cash advance.

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Friday it had begun an investigation into public reports that Democrat Ruben Kihuen engaged in sexual harassment , and a second lawmaker denied a former aide","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Friday it had begun an investigation into public reports that Democrat Ruben Kihuen engaged in sexual harassment, and a second lawmaker denied a former aide had filed a complaint against her.\n\u201cThere appears to be credible allegations of misconduct by a lawmaker regarding sexual matters,\u201d Democrat Eric Swalwell, chairman of the committee, said in a statement.\nThe statement was issued after Reps. Ron Wright, a Democrat from North Carolina, and Ruben Kihuen, whose home state is located just south of the Chesapeake Bay and whose family founded the beer business that bears his name, each issued statements denying having engaged in harassment.\nWright said he had made a \u201cmistake\u201d and was \u201cpardonable\u201d but that he had been working through personal difficulties that \u201cobviously,\u201d included \u201cpsychological stress.\u201d He said he made the mistake of thinking that he had the right to ask the young woman about her sexual preference but had then \u201cdoubted where my power goes when it comes to other people\u2019s choices.\u201d\nKihuen denied he had ever done anything that would have violated House rules and said he and Wright had had a brief encounter in a public building, but that it was an \u201cinformal situation.\u201d He said he and Wright had \u201chad professional acquaintanceships, that is all.\u201d\nA member of Congress for North Carolina filed a complaint with the Congressional Ethics Oversight Board in July claiming that Rep. Kihuen sexually harassed the woman as she worked for Kihuen\u2019s company, North Carolina Beer Marketing, and that he told her in private, \u201c\u2018This is not something you should say to me.'\u201d\nThe panel said it would begin an investigation of the complaint and asked Wright\u2019s office to forward the complaint.\nAfter Wright spoke with The Associated Press, Kihuen issued the following statement: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize that this is a difficult and painful subject for me,\u201d Kihuen said. \u201cI do not have the energy or the willingness to engage in this subject and frankly I don\u2019t have the information to do so on my own terms and in a way that would be helpful or helpful for anyone else who is considering speaking up. \u201c\nIn the statement Monday, Wright said he had misperceived the nature of the situation and thought his words to the woman \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t help how I feel\u201d \u2014 were \u201can expression of a very private and personal truth.\u201d\nBut, he said, he and Kihuen had \u201cdiscussed the matter publicly\u201d and he learned during the discussion that she had asked him to \u201cremain distant,\u201d the statement read. He said he had since spoken with the woman and was sorry he misinterpreted their conversation.\n\u201cThis is a difficult subject. I admit that I made a mistake on a fairly simple issue \u2014 one that, it appears, may be misconstrued and even misinterpreted \u2014 when I asked a worker to leave because I was unhappy with her dress,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to the extent I believe I did in good faith, that\u2019s important.

{"prompt":"Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday the issue of whether President Donald Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe","text":"Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday the issue of whether President Donald Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe.\nBut three days before the Democratic debate, Trump said he saw nothing wrong with the Russians meddling in the election and accused his former FBI director James Comey of lying.\nIn a Twitter exchange with a journalist, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, Trump said Comey told the White House he had no proof that Russian officials had hacked the Democratic National Committee in anticipation of the November 2016 election.\nIt is unclear if Comey ever told the White House of the hacks. And there have been no reports of any direct evidence of an internal DNC hack during the 2016 election.\nWhile there have been other reports linking Trump campaign associates to Russian meddling, the focus of the probe has largely been on his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump\u2019s critics have also questioned whether his decision to meet with Putin two days before the election would have increased his popularity.\nLast month, the House Intelligence Committee held a hearing, which concluded there was no evidence of foreign interference in the election. But the panel said on Wednesday it had limited evidence that Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians.\nAt a news conference on the Capitol steps, Sen. Mark Warner, D-VA, said he would hold a hearing on intelligence on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe FBI may have left something to the political side,\u201d Warner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a conspiracy theory \u2014 it\u2019s fact.\u201d\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the panel\u2019s conclusion had not been changed, despite the controversy.\nAfter the vote Wednesday, Comey, when asked if he thought the report reflected the panel unanimously held by Democrats had stated his opinion that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in 2016, replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the report yet.\u201d\nSchiff and other panel leaders expressed cautious optimism that they would have time to address questions remaining after the hearing.\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said he would hold \u201cinterim\u201d hearings in light of the public debate and be back before the panel on July 18. At his hearing Wednesday, Burr said he was open to inviting retired officers or \u201cother senior members of the intelligence community\u201d to testify after his July 18 hearing.\nThe Trump campaign has tried to use the issue to paint the Democrats as partisan and unwilling to find out what happened during Trump \u2019 s 2016 election campaign before the White House.\nBut on Wednesday, one of Trump \u2019 s closest advisers said there were no \u201calternatives\u201d to the current report.\n\u201dIn the absence of credible new information, there is no reason to dismiss this report, because it is based on extensive and ongoing intelligence assessment,\u201d Trump Campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski wrote in a letter to Trump. \u201cWe will never allow Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election to compromise the trust of our country in the results of the election.\u201d\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Carter Page said Wednesday he spoke to Comey two months ago and asked if he

The breach was not a compromise of the company\u2019s own records.\nThis is an opportunity for you to purchase one of these beautifully restored early 70's Ford Mustang Mach 1 Convertibles.

{"prompt":"Prime Minister Theresa May s senior minister will not have to resign over claims that police found pornography on a work computer and that he made an inappropriate sexual advance against a young woman ,","text":"Prime Minister Theresa May s senior minister will not have to resign over claims that police found pornography on a work computer and that he made an inappropriate sexual advance against a young woman, according to a report in the Mail on Sunday.\nThe PM said she had given a clear mandate to police to investigate the allegations\nShe said the alleged crime was entirely false \u2014 and that if his actions could be proved, he must resign\nHe had been named by the Mail as acting home secretary in July and it claimed he had shown his \"unsuitable\" laptop to a member of his staff in July, which triggered a further investigation.\nThe report in Sunday's Mail said it was apparent at a meeting in October that Mr Gove was \"embarrassed\" by his laptop and that he was not in the employ of the PM's office when he showed the device.\nMr Gove has long maintained that his conduct was not criminal and has never said there was proof he took the laptop home.\n\"He was not a junior member of senior officials' teams and there was no evidence that, at the time that his laptop was shown to him \u2026 he was working anywhere in Downing Street,\" a Downing Street spokesman said.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said she had given a clear instruction to HMIC that he must be investigated. ()\n\"I take full responsibility for the way those around me act and I believe, for what that is worth, that the person who did this must make a quick and proper apology to the young woman and face justice if appropriate from the police,\" she said.\n\"I will be determined to make sure that the facts of this case are investigated robustly and it will be up to the police to take whatever evidence they deem necessary.\n\"There was no suggestion that the behaviour was criminal, but if the facts are found and if he has acted inappropriately, I will have no hesitation in saying that he needs to resign.\"\nI had absolutely no right to show a laptop to anybody\nHowever, The Mail on Sunday claimed several people who worked in Mr Gove's office knew he took a laptop to his home, and suggested he showed the hard drive to a member of senior staff.\nIt said he was \"embarrassed\" by his laptop \u2014 \"showing a laptop that was, in the opinion of many people, unsuitable for work had nothing to do with someone who was the boss of his own work\".\nHe said the PM had told him directly \"that she was extremely disappointed\" with the device and ordered a full investigation.\nThe Mail added his laptop was removed from his desk and never left his home, although he later told a friend that it was stored in a locked cupboard.\nHe said he had said he did not remember what he had done with the computer, but it turned up later in an investigation.\nHis story has also been supported by Ms May and her lawyer, Ian Leven QC, who told Sky News his client had made no inappropriate statements about a woman nor taken a laptop from her home.\nMs May is the subject of several complaints under the British law that allows complainants to allege sexual misconduct.

{"prompt":"Russia proposed a two-day ceasefire on Monday in the last major rebel stronghold near the Syrian capital Damascus , where warplanes killed at least 41 people in two days of air strikes as Russian-backed government","text":"Russia proposed a two-day ceasefire on Monday in the last major rebel stronghold near the Syrian capital Damascus, where warplanes killed at least 41 people in two days of air strikes as Russian-backed government troops came under heavy fire. Assad was on Monday speaking out against those who supported those who were killing people by the side of Aleppo, and said, \u201cFor a while, they all supported them. There was no one who was against it.\u201d The opposition said the government had been sending arms to the rebels, some of which went uncut, and the opposition had been using those arms against military positions.\nThe head of the United States\u2019 Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, has not yet confirmed plans to start an investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s contacts with Russia.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration has been accused by Republicans of \u201cleaking\u201d in connection to a report that a key adviser to the White House was linked to an elite intelligence gathering group.\nThe report was based on leaked documents obtained by Wikileaks and the Wall Street Journal that indicated that former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s family paid $750,000 to a group of retired military officers and politicians in order to obtain intelligence in the run up to a presidential campaign while the president was serving in office.\nMueller, who oversees the special counsel\u2019s business, told Fox News and CNN that he had not yet said whether he would start an investigation over the matter.\nLast month, the whistle-blower, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told the Wall St. Journal that a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d had provided details of the campaign\u2019s intelligence gathering to a senior Trump campaign official, in defiance of federal laws that prevent top aides from talking about ongoing investigations. The whistleblower said he provided the report to the campaign\u2019s intelligence director. The journal reported last week that the person in charge of making sure all the information flowing between Trump\u2019s associates and intelligence agencies was handled properly was not a current White House staff member, but a retired CIA official.\nIn the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, one of the key witnesses was William Colby, who had been CIA director that same year, but didn\u2019t have any information about the campaign. Colby, Clinton\u2019s former political appointee, who was under an oath to tell the truth, insisted that he would not discuss the matter on a public record.\nLast year, a senior Republican Congresswoman objected to Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s disclosure of documents obtained by Wikileaks and the Wall Street Journal, that were believed to be connected to the presidential campaign, saying that they were \u201cspilling the beans.\u201d\nLast month, when Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, an outspoken Trump critic, said there was \u201cno reason to delay\u201d the release of any documents or other evidence that might connect the administration to campaign-related activities, the White House was accused of leaking.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, suggested that a presidential candidate should be investigated for violating the country\u2019s federal campaign laws if his aides are seen as engaging in money laundering.\nIn the House last month, Rep.

{"prompt":"Sweden will let some migrants who arrived as unaccompanied minors and turned 18 during the process of applying for asylum stay even if their applications are rejected , a rare relaxation of rules imposed at","text":"Sweden will let some migrants who arrived as unaccompanied minors and turned 18 during the process of applying for asylum stay even if their applications are rejected, a rare relaxation of rules imposed at the start of the conflict between migrants and the authorities.\nThe ministry announced on Saturday that as long as the refugees don\u2019t have criminal records or problems with Sweden\u2019s immigration rules, such applicants can be granted a temporary residence permit and receive basic social security benefits. Sweden had already said this can be possible if \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d do not arise, such as criminal records or problems about the application process. \u201cWe have a principle to be lenient towards refugees. But the last two years have been very difficult for refugees,\u201d Migration Agency spokesman Carl-Guntram Schellhorn said.\nDuring the conflict, the authorities took over the unaccompanied minors and decided whether they could stay or be returned. Under this system, the migrants themselves decided in what country they wanted to apply for asylum, and in order to receive a favourable outcome to their application in Sweden, they had to find their own way to Germany, then Greece, and ultimately try to gain entry into the EU. The system did lead to some irregular migrants taking a boat to the EU border through Greece\u2019s Aegean Sea, but in total Sweden deported only a small fraction of those who applied for asylum.\nHowever, the conflict pinned a heavy strain on Swedish resources. Sweden is currently on a budget cut. Migration is seen as an expensive and politically sensitive issue that is prone to scandals but at the same time generates money from receiving refugees.\nAccording to a study from the Migration Agency, those seeking asylum arrive in Finland at a higher rate than in other countries in Europe, with as many as 2,000 seeking refuge per year. Among the main countries to send migrants to Finland are Sweden and Russia.\nThe ministry says that the number of unaccompanied minors has fallen since the start of the conflict between migrants and the authorities. In 2015, some 1,700 unaccompanied refugees arrived in Finland and around 400 were minors. In total, about 2,200 refugees arrived in Finland last year. In total, there were 14,700 people living in Sweden\u2019s foreign settlement scheme in October, according to Statistics Sweden.\nThe majority of those were people who arrived in the country in 2007. In addition, there are around 3,000 refugees in the country with a permanent residence permits. According to the Migration agency, the number of refugees with permits grew by 10% last year. It expects to be around 40,000 this year.\nIn late December, there were around 7,000 people living in Finland\u2019s foreign settlement scheme. However, this was down by 3,500 from October. The number of people eligible to receive the settlement scheme is restricted, as there is a waiting list. Last year, around 8,000 people submitted applications for an asylum permit in Finland, Finland\u2019s Immigration Service said.\nAt a press conference in January, Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said he was worried about the rising number of migrants in Finland and said his country is ready to take on new refugees. There were more than 90 refugees living in Finland at the beginning of 2018, said Finnish migration agency MIVI.\nIn the Finnish city of Turku, some 350 refugees have settled in a school and a hotel. Finnish government said an additional 150 such dormitory spaces have been identified and built under the agreement that came into force on January 1 this year between MIVI and the city of

{"prompt":"Three Republican U.S. lawmakers called on Friday for Robert Mueller to resign as special counsel investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election , the latest in a series of conservatives \u2019 criticisms of the FBI","text":"Three Republican U.S. lawmakers called on Friday for Robert Mueller to resign as special counsel investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, the latest in a series of conservatives \u2019 criticisms of the FBI over the Russia probe.In interviews with CNN and ABC News on \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., expressed frustration with the Russia investigation and called for President Donald Trump to \u201cmake a final statement\u201d that Mueller should step down from the job. \u201cThe president must say we are done with the Russia investigation,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe are not done.\u201dU.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and that Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Ukraine to help obtain dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by leaking a military investigation that found Trump\u2019s son Hunter was guilty of misconduct. The evidence of obstruction and collusion with the Russian government is damning, congressional investigators told lawmakers on Thursday. The bipartisan panel that oversees the Russian investigation at the Intelligence Panel on Russian Activities (IPCA) is expected to issue its report on whether the Trump campaign had broken laws that have since been addressed or not by lawmakers in a series of sweeps last year. The president has publicly asked for the conclusion of Russia investigation to be dropped. \u201cIt would be more prudent to resign, give us hope that the president, the U.S. authorities, their intelligence agencies \u2014 that they have not been misled \u2014 we don\u2019t have any additional evidence of collusion with Russia,\u201d Gowdy told CNN. The three conservative lawmakers said that their requests are merely a sign that Trump has to be assured that the investigation will be kept open, and the president has to confirm that he is not being bullied by his White House. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of him trying to pressure me to fire somebody who I respect very highly. It is a matter of him telling me that it matters to him,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cIf he\u2019s doing this \u2014 if he\u2019s not doing this \u2014 if he\u2019s not telling the truth \u2026 I hope that he is on the side of democracy.\u201d The three lawmakers are all former intelligence officials. Gowdy was an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Capitol building, Alexander served as a CIA analyst in Afghanistan, and Paul is a former intelligence director. The three lawmakers are the latest senators to ask Mueller to resign, after Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Bill Nelson of Florida, and Marco Rubio of Florida, all said on Thursday that Mueller should step down. Feinstein and the two other senators met Thursday afternoon with Trump, but the president has said that he would seek to defend the Russia investigation. Republican senators have not spoken to the president about their concerns about the Russia investigation, though they\u2019ve all expressed disappointment with Donald Trump and his handling of the investigation.U.S. intelligence officials previously testified in congressional hearings that intelligence agencies had been exposed to Russian hackers\u2019 use of social media to spread disinformation ahead of the 2016 election, and that they were able to defeat the election hacking.

{"prompt":"Paul Manafort , the indicted former campaign manager for President Donald Trump , spent almost $ 1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $ 1.3 million on clothes from shops in","text":"Paul Manafort, the indicted former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, spent almost $ 1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $ 1.3 million on clothes from shops in Florida, Texas, New York, Paris and Tokyo, according to documents reviewed by NBC Newspapers.\nTrump has been accused of tax evasion. For example, in a lawsuit brought by the Democratic Party in Illinois against the election of Donald Trump, his brother Robert Trump and others, the Democratic Party requested that all the money Donald Trump paid with fraudulent tax documents be blocked.\nTrump, however, did not respond to the request until more than one year after it was made, when Trump said that his taxes were verified, and has never complained about the Democrats trying to access his financial matters.\nThe president also did not respond to a similar request from the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose financial information about him, nor did he respond to requests from congressional investigators asking for material about his finances.\nIn the new report, the NBC News editors concluded that Trump, like the Republican Party and Donald Trump, had \u201clong enjoyed access to high-flying and high-priced services and goods.\u201d\nThe former New York City mayor also had a \u201clongstanding pattern of personal relationships with suppliers and customers in high-priced luxury goods.\u201d\nThese were some of the items that Manafort had purchased: $ 15,300 for three Louis Vuitton bags that had been given by his girlfriend Lisa Page ; $ 24,800 for a Louis Vuitton clutch made by French designer Marc Jacobs for the former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\u201cThere was no specific reason for my purchase of this item,\u201d Manafort wrote. \u201cThis was just a product I wanted to have, and I did not make any statement that I chose this luxury item.\u201d\nIn a statement, Manafort\u2019s lawyer, Paul Erickson, said the former campaign manager always \u201cworked with\u201d the government and \u201cfulfilled all of his duties in full.\u201d\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the NBC report and will comment in due course,\u201d said Donald Trump Jr. through his campaign, who he was vice president of business affairs at the time. Manafort worked for Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s business in New York City, and is now suing him for $ 5 million, claiming that Trump tried to interfere with the investigation in which he was charged.\n\u201cI do not have information regarding a specific campaign contribution or campaign expenditure that was not allowed by the law; nor do I have information regarding a specific account or account balance that was not in accordance with required disclosure.\u201d\nWhen NBC reported on the New York Post that it reviewed documents that showed Manafort buying goods from French apparel shops with a price tag that was eight times the average, the Republican candidate did not respond, according to the New York Post.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s staff members were aware of the content of some of these documents on June 1, 2016, when the Post\u2019s reporting prompted the President\u2019s staff to discuss our findings with the President, a process in which he expressed no concerns,\u201d the report said. In addition to the luxury goods purchased by the former campaign manager, New York Post also found that Donald Trump Jr. and three of his children participated in the purchase of real estate. The New York Post has not published the information that they reviewed, but other publications have reviewed this and reported that the children bought properties worth $ 5 million in a single transaction.","token_len":728,"entropy":[11.2851,1.1146,2.2641,9.4127,1.4882,0.5035,0.7807,0.6386,2.0315,0.7215,0.0021,0.9973,6.6355,4.7192,1.4712,10.8441,0.3597,1.0553,9.1392,9.0982,3.1574,2.1269,4.436,3.8849,4.2293,7.0503,0.0889,0.1351,2.4185,2.2609,2.4512,0.012,0.745,4.5633,5.0781,7.8761,1.135,3.2103,0.8448,4.501,0.6712,2.3151,0.5665,0.8134,7.7321,0.6577,5.61,1.3293,0.2688,0.0011,2.8474,2.8372,0.049,4.7015,13.2782,0.0033,0.2544,0.7597,20.7975,2.1969,2.7962,1.2358,0.2095,5.7652,0.9471,3.4619,6.6595,1.8546,0.0171,1.6068,2.267,4.3232,2.6565,0.4589,1.7725,4.4743,2.2041,2.1118,8.2471,2.419,1.9384,6.5066,1.1353,3.5322,0.0896,1.5277,4.1077,4.9186,3.8866,2.3731,3.6592,3.8415,2.1404,3.3305,4.2362,0.9641,7.2015,1.1217,4.9482,2.7246,1.8719,8.1528,0.1914,3.5196,6.1558,7.813,2.0553,4.3254,0.3284,6.8799,1.7486,0.7716,15.8558,3.1026,3.9374,0.0037,3.1923,0.1218,2.0398,0.2512,2.39,1.913,4.889,5.0642,0.2129,5.2174,0.6091,0.6109,2.6869,0.1956,2.9148,3.3959,2.9862,4.0476,4.3042,2.2514,2.372,5.3809,0.8117,9.7959,2.8076,1.6364,5.9746,3.5066,5.6311,0.9978,1.3289,7.7042,4.1178,0.0106,7.8047,0.5718,3.004,9.0324,0.2105,0.3106,2.2363,5.5583,2.9973,3.4539,0.0252,0.4382,0.1321,1.4706,6.3829,0.8037,1.0766,1.1809,5.0253,3.1144,1.2129,3.9797,0.0074,0.0006,0.0015,3.2444,4.5145,4.752,1.029,1.4465,2.2786,1.7231,3.4612,0.8056,0.2131,1.0277,0.1864,2.105,1.2691,4.0905,0.7843,4.3576,1.4924,6.8928,1.953,0.8317,2.6426,0.4548,0.3092,2.6495,2.638,5.3683,3.2324,0.2414,1.6701,5.4352,0.8198,6.2445,5.313,0.1862,1.6123,3.6976,3.5559,2.835,3.4128,1.9873,2.2961,6.8685,0.163,2.2166,2.8084,15.875,7.2585,7.5284,7.2029,4.1076,0.0368,5.4344,0.1612,5.2597,3.7913,2.3252,0.0277,2.3981,7.8964,2.3038,6.1938,1.9946,8.8012,7.5324,1.055,1.8557,5.2994,3.653,0.0789,1.8279,0.7623,3.954,2.5571,2.0979,10.2542,0.2599,3.4985,2.5074,6.7341,0.2138,5.2738,2.5932,0.4896,10.4576,1.3128,4.1256,3.0329,4.0143,0.0945,1.8744,3.613,2.1494,1.3823,3.3914,0.4503,0.8409,5.8694,3.4251,4.7984,0.0436,0.1402,2.9046,1.2186,5.8903,3.1279,3.2381,4.1776,4.7231,8.391,0.6174,5.7937,1.8181,4.4633,7.8128,0.0396,0.0,1.4841,3.3568,2.8016,0.8405,4.4569,3.5064,2.8781,5.6705,6.0352,4.3991,7.2421,0.2879,5.2184,0.0438,3.2351,0.1349,1.211,4.115,0.0043,0.0,8.6526,4.2183,0.6388,6.2187,2.0254,4.5917,0.961,4.3312,2.6102,4.6758,5.1363,0.0731,5.8213,0.0755,2.9662,0.7449,2.1648,1.6899,5.5562,1.0996,4.2001,5.6856,2.9982,0.4214,8.5697,2.0222,0.9476,2.4747,3.074,1.4589,3.8924,1.5201,6.5067,2.4189,1.0247,3.9913,0.546,3.7209,1.279,3.0246,1.0145,4.9896,2.6836,3.3558,0.9734,3.4138,2.8697,1.8714,1.2245,2.9401,0.3734,4.5764,1.0985,6.0516,2.5806,1.0158,6.0921,1.5533,5.1764,1.201,1.6264,0.9426,0.6479,0.3106,2.8802,2.5177,1.8913,1.1707,2.5403,9.8015,6.4527,3.471,0.8952,0.8304,4.0924,10.1214,1.3215,0.2423,0.8104,2.19,4.001,2.1781,0.3121,7.7313,8.7243,0.2791,5.0138,1.3011,10.6105,3.1777,1.8133,4.7485,1.8975,5.2915,0.0271,10.1415,0.2664,4.0105,1.6015,1.0144,1.1919,2.447,5.0076,2.7264,2.3967,0.8104,0.3043,2.4415,0.4853,3.8406,1.9895,5.2651,0.9706,0.9654,6.2645,2.9468,1.1216,0.7376,5.8246,3.3086,0.8686,0.013,3.7507,0.4886,1.7154,3.0293,5.8412,1.1127,1.2931,0.6244,7.1263,1.3952,4.6894,3.7804,1.8929,5.0856,5.0099,10.565,0.4022,1.1711,4.4848,2.6396,2.1878,0.8038,0.0184,0.6173,8.8493,5.4504,1.6501,3.9618,0.0645,1.819,0.57,5.3002,1.6636,0.5105,4.3576,2.3331,2.7096,0.1634,1.7202,1.3619,2.0692,4.6783,2.3035,6.6402,3.8987,0.7855,2.7144,5.0513,0.9276,2.1707,4.6115,0.7476,3.684,6.1565,0.0365,4.7615,0.599,1.1151,1.2293,3.8889,4.3773,0.7796,1.2277,3.2743,0.957,0.352,1.9605,0.3373,3.8892,3.8384,0.162,2.3473,2.899,2.2641,4.086,2.0337,4.4826,3.3365,1.8106,2.3589,2.9186,2.4263,1.2309,3.7581,7.4639,1.136,1.0665,1.5779,5.5595,3.1599,0.8083,0.0876,0.4621,1.0902,0.6817,2.3266,0.2135,5.5447,1.7801,1.352,4.1997,0.7393,0.2038,0.6432,4.6,3.7463,0.004,6.725,1.2892,3.5299,0.3957,1.229,0.4424,4.9664,2.9415,2.8601,0.8165,0.7177,4.6394,0.0166,3.9352,6.1926,3.0813,5.476,3.575,2.3961,2.9735,2.142,5.485,4.6802,1.3371,6.6007,6.4375,4.9216,4.5628,2.5003,5.2704,0.9033,2.5561,1.9378,7.1271,0.2769,0.8806,3.3676,4.0337,1.4792,5.5519,3.029,3.5568,0.0368,0.7346,3.0441,2.8092,0.0041,1.0126,2.9794,0.0157,0.231,0.477,0.529,2.0968,0.3902,2.2893,5.2331,3.4711,0.7977,0.0282,5.5117,5.5478,2.8178,3.14,0.2892,0.6708,6.0865,0.1481,4.425,0.1018,1.4893,0.8688,5.0498,4.1937,3.452,0.3716,2.3884,0.3954,1.6083,1.8992,1.3013,6.7102,1.5035,0.0499,3.5474,6.625,1.5088,3.1421,0.8029,0.1513,0.003,0.5042,0.1746,4.9491,6.981,4.1907,1.1245,1.3381,2.5755,2.4189,4.2081,5.4676,4.8415,0.0298,1.7346,5.7663,5.0986,2.7346,2.5461,6.1826,1.2128,1.7852,3.3598,0.7131,0.0532,4.4849,2.5563,1.8794,1.203,9.2479,1.1675,3.5651,0.9903,1.4018,2.3973,1.3921,0.2799,0.3104,6.5154,0.0692,1.7118,3.997,2.3393,0.7813,5.0621,0.0298,0.8458,0.293,2.9267,3.7839,1.8985,0.1323,2.243,5.0144,0.0276,2.5801,1.6645,0.182,6.0644,0.0309,4.0231,2.7124,4.1012,0.0021,0.0931,4.1417,1.3697,4.1536,1.4318,2.7548,2.7645,4.9197,5.98,1.7946,1.4657,5.1278,5.3137,0.6618,4.5127,4.6867,4.503,3.8482,2.4994,1.2521,5.7328,3.0976,3.2567,3.505,1.7977,

{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins","text":"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins the Alabama special election on Nov. 3.\n\"Republicans of the Senate need to keep in mind that we want to be working in the office right now,\" McConnell said, during a luncheon speech at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual conference. \"We need to get to the floor of the Senate in the first month, and we need to pass legislation on this and get moving on other things, but we shouldn't be playing into an attempt to stop a very qualified, experienced politician.\"\nMoore's campaign, which had initially refused to concede, is now conceding a few hours after the polls closed on Tuesday and he just needs to surpass 70% of the vote to win a bid to reclaim the Senate he lost to Democrat Doug Jones last year.\nBut campaign officials have come under mounting pressure from Democrats, pundits and even the White House under President Trump.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that he would vote to impeach Trump based on a falsehood he told during a speech at a tea party conference in February that a presidential election would be settled by machines and not by votes.\n\"I would like this to go through so that people understand the dangers that are not far from our door,\" he said. \"But to say to the American people, particularly when they\u2019re in a state that is very important to us here in the Senate, Alabama \u2014 and it\u2019s a pretty close one \u2014 where a large number of people are voting \u2014 that their votes would be invalid, in any way, would be devastating to them, and we should be working in any way we can to make sure that their voices get counted tomorrow.\"\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this month that McConnell held a secret meeting with Trump in the White House \u2014 days after the publication of the newspaper's report \u2014 to discuss his approach to helping get rid of Moore. Trump supported his campaign and said that Moore \"has the full support of the White House.\"\nThe White House didn't respond on Tuesday to a request for comment from the Post by sending spokesmen to an earlier briefing on Capitol Hill on climate change.\nTrump was scheduled to travel to Jacksonville, Fla., on Tuesday but opted to stay home after the post-report news and the campaign conceding it would be \"a close race.\"\nMoore, a church elder and self-described Christian, has faced allegations of sexual assault. He has denied the allegations and called the election rigged.\nMoore's campaign said that two of his aides have resigned. The campaign said he had received \"more than $300,000 contributions from more than 130 individuals and groups,\" but didn't elaborate. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue Monday afternoon.\n\"I'm praying for Roy,\" Trump tweeted. \"There's always going to be controversy and criticism, and I have to expect that in politics. I hope Roy handles it very well. He is, as I said, very qualified.\"\nBut his supporters have rallied around him, many accusing Democrats of seeking to \"black mail\" the voters in their own states in what they say should be a free and fair election.\n\"This isn\u2019t a vote for Trump, that's why we did it,\" Moore's campaign manager, Michael P.

{"prompt":"Islamic State threatened attacks on U.S. soil in retaliation for the Trump administration s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , one of the group s social media accounts reported on Thursday","text":"Islamic State threatened attacks on U.S. soil in retaliation for the Trump administration s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, one of the group s social media accounts reported on Thursday. The Islamic State has carried out hundreds of suicide bombings and assassinations in Iraq, Syria and neighboring countries and poses a particular threat in Syria, where the militant group is said to control an urban stretch covering much of the country's capital and a large part of the country's western countryside. Israel has been trying to contain the militant group in Syria for nearly two years.\nThe Islamic State, which gained much of its territory in Iraq and Syria from 2014 via violent conflict and attacks, gained support after the killing of the former Iranian strongman, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in a 1991 Islamic Revolution.\nThe United Kingdom s largest oil refinery in England s Norfolk suffered a major loss of oil by accident late Tuesday, prompting officials to warn it could lead to a major spike in gas prices.\nThe accident happened around 10:00 p.m. about 100 miles east of London aboard a truck carrying 200,000 barrels of a crude oil product called petroleum oil. It happened when two containers for a chemical substance called amine got loose on the roof of the tanker, causing the oil to mix with water and ignite.\nAs a result of this accident, it can be seen from the map above, the prices of petroleum gas at the wholesale stage is gradually rising. At present, the price of RON95 and the price of RON88 are both about 10 percent higher than before the accident, and after the accident, the price is obviously up from 25 RON to 27 RON, although it has not reached the peak yet.\nAt 10 o'clock this morning, the price of RON95 was 21 RON 3, and the price of RON86 was 21. The price of RON82 was also 21, with more than 5 percent of the peak price.\nThe price of gasoline was 20 RON at 10 o'clock this morning, which has not reached the peak price from Monday. The prices of RON70 and RON75 were similar, around 21 RON.\nAccording to the statistics of the British Energy Authority, prices have increased about 16 percent in recent months because of the increased supply of crude oil and the increasing costs of crude oil processing. However, the costs of crude oil processing have also increased recently, so the increasing costs of oil refineries will have an impact on gasoline prices in the future.\nAt the beginning of the year, gasoline prices in the United Kingdom have often been in the range of 9 RON to 7 RON, and some places even dropped 6 to 8 RON. But at the beginning of the year, the price of gasoline in the UK was in the range of 9 to 15 RON, and the price was more than 15 RON. At the beginning of February, the price of gasoline in the United Kingdom had fallen back to the range of 5 to 7 RON.\nIn other major European countries, the cost of gasoline has been rising.

[news_title] => News: Indonesia says calls for US boycott not misguided[\/news_title]\nThe United Nations Security Council has voted unanimously to extend the international sanctions on Afghanistan, but the effort has been criticized by some diplomats for being too weak.\nThe vote -- by UN Resolution 2158 -- does not impose a military ban on Afghanistan as some diplomats and civil society activists had hoped. The U.S. and Russia vetoed.\nAt the time, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski was quoted as saying the new resolution will not lead to a military crackdown on Afghan authorities.\n\"It has to be seen in its context. The main message to (the Afghan government) remains to do what is consistent with the commitments you have made in the [UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women] and other international agreements,\" Malinowski told reporters.\nSenior diplomat Angela Kane, a member of the panel that drafted the bill, told Reuters the vote also does not reflect a new trend in sanctions in the UN or the world as a whole.\nThe resolution, first introduced in December, would have imposed a ban in December 2016 but was repeatedly postponed. UN Special Envoy Jean-Pierre Lacroix says sanctions may only be imposed when it is clear the Taliban have broken their end of the deal they signed with the US and the Taliban.\nStill, after the resolution was passed, a diplomat who was in the UN negotiating team, who has been asked not to be named, called it a \"meaningful first step,\" adding it \"may have been the start of the end of the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan.\"\nKane said the draft resolution did not change what has been known to be the intent of the Security Council: to put pressure on Afghan authorities and send a message that the sanctions on the Taliban are being pursued. The resolution in effect will allow international efforts to continue on a new basis, she said.\nAfter the resolution was passed, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington would not block it from coming to a vote in the coming days and it would be presented to the council in order to give it the time to be debated.\n\"I think it's extremely positive....it clearly demonstrates that we take the resolution very seriously,\" he said in Washington.\n\"There is no substitute for action and as long as they have no serious intention to engage with the process, the international community is not going to stop, and this bill will move forward,\" he added. \"It gives us a strong message that we are very serious about holding the Taliban to the same level of engagement with the international community as we have with other states.\"\nAn Afghan official working towards the resolution who asked not to be named said it was important to have a strong resolution that was broadly supported by the Security Council.\n\"If there isn't that, we can end up in a state of deadlock in the Security Council, which will hinder us in our overall agenda and our overall effort....it would be disappointing to see this bill come up in any way as a compromise,\" he told Reuters.\nDespite the support of the UN, it has been criticized for being too weak and too costly in some respects. One of them is that it is unlikely to have much effect if the Taliban is not obliged to negotiate.","token_len":730,"entropy":[9.6281,0.178,10.2014,12.3568,0.7098,4.0589,2.4875,2.1875,0.672,8.21,0.7471,1.8189,2.8164,0.4949,5.8977,0.0234,0.0568,0.1915,2.8979,5.8308,5.3823,0.462,0.008,9.2748,3.228,0.3697,3.7119,0.6531,0.0768,0.4654,0.0349,0.0871,0.0714,1.2895,6.8537,7.7611,4.287,2.8336,0.2649,8.8583,0.0166,0.3953,3.8313,7.657,5.716,7.4929,4.7904,3.077,0.995,8.6609,6.653,1.88,8.8745,1.4554,10.114,7.7819,2.8515,5.0867,3.9299,6.0932,0.095,6.1941,0.4446,6.6077,4.9896,8.9365,0.0843,0.039,0.0064,0.0174,1.154,9.7873,4.0101,2.6258,2.3253,0.0007,2.1326,2.8451,1.9126,0.6017,5.8251,0.9799,6.353,3.3893,1.2836,9.9626,1.7991,2.7592,1.9025,7.4353,1.4154,1.2887,3.1722,0.3998,2.1681,4.3652,4.1701,1.9333,1.309,3.1884,1.0395,0.8131,1.9158,3.4618,7.6008,4.3885,6.2537,5.4598,4.0205,4.5886,1.4285,5.3637,0.0885,5.0305,1.877,5.5328,3.3475,0.6249,2.8184,4.3639,3.5763,1.5376,3.2637,4.6447,0.1764,3.5004,2.8268,1.2613,1.0453,2.6025,3.4691,0.0012,0.3699,0.1595,2.0632,3.6633,3.1892,8.7407,0.3449,5.3581,0.8516,2.0183,0.5474,2.9469,0.0006,0.234,0.0266,6.333,0.0211,0.2597,0.0422,7.5442,5.8692,0.2561,0.9758,3.8165,1.3629,0.7575,0.0952,2.3576,4.8582,1.7611,4.1314,1.6165,5.0429,0.0475,1.3046,1.2824,6.5399,1.0448,3.639,6.024,0.8924,0.4866,1.7059,2.1853,3.9517,1.6697,0.7743,3.4246,2.3316,2.8743,3.3796,2.0859,2.0982,5.5126,3.724,3.0546,7.1899,1.0621,4.114,0.5507,0.1734,7.1404,3.1347,3.8031,1.1724,1.4065,7.1852,0.0745,1.0953,5.7972,5.1409,2.1283,0.1491,2.5219,0.7163,5.9975,1.9017,6.9718,0.2758,0.1305,2.5041,0.0005,0.0044,0.1341,0.0274,0.0053,0.896,1.055,0.4694,1.2072,0.7441,3.0895,1.3292,2.6728,1.1828,0.2528,0.0003,0.0035,1.6084,0.9404,1.2284,0.2902,7.2011,4.9164,8.9426,5.0784,2.1223,2.3489,2.5349,0.0042,0.2259,5.8787,1.7335,3.2235,0.0909,6.3856,0.2163,1.7191,2.2296,1.8282,2.2844,5.3059,3.3818,0.0449,3.9073,2.9074,3.5818,4.7813,1.5512,4.6633,4.1239,0.8444,5.5975,4.4691,1.6062,3.8289,4.2683,0.2509,0.0028,0.2335,0.2484,3.1025,2.3846,2.6271,5.4611,1.5508,0.4883,3.34,1.1519,3.106,2.3723,1.989,1.4541,3.0158,5.3941,5.3244,2.2791,5.6313,2.1142,6.5911,3.1492,2.0528,6.4163,4.4398,1.1636,0.0003,6.7163,0.1542,2.4612,6.4744,0.7101,0.0,4.8687,2.9424,5.0752,4.3107,0.4548,1.2381,2.6295,3.2984,0.4823,2.73,2.1704,6.3492,2.6776,4.7001,2.7335,7.5623,0.2154,0.5069,1.6126,6.8595,1.9534,0.882,0.8415,3.1649,2.1253,2.8441,2.2832,3.1577,0.2866,6.4717,0.0937,5.8618,1.4496,3.3614,0.6732,2.1088,0.5126,3.5007,6.6208,2.5125,1.8671,2.5356,1.5568,4.5571,5.3664,1.4387,3.3452,2.9101,3.5305,1.4326,4.8721,1.6718,0.0052,0.3883,0.3226,0.2052,3.8986,1.6707,0.9378,0.6735,5.7789,0.1037,5.7067,0.0453,3.432,2.3077,3.2809,2.93,3.6588,2.201,1.6202,2.6015,4.6423,0.1486,1.8209,1.2946,0.5571,0.7285,4.7111,1.3389,4.908,1.0443,0.6344,0.5707,0.1892,2.9763,0.0992,0.7831,0.9143,4.7932,0.5197,3.0151,0.085,3.7644,4.4899,3.9519,0.5338,4.6282,3.3588,0.9179,0.7114,6.9103,0.1886,0.4026,2.861,0.0017,2.9592,1.7031,4.5304,2.3319,0.0275,3.7676,1.5969,2.9409,5.4211,0.2389,0.4093,1.3152,1.167,4.9532,4.4254,0.7388,0.3638,1.2574,3.1493,6.0486,1.1224,3.9735,3.0679,6.7272,3.1749,3.7218,4.0128,5.4031,4.8805,0.2152,4.3751,3.7985,2.3508,4.7282,3.9949,1.6529,0.6476,0.248,0.205,0.1844,5.0657,0.7841,2.3894,0.612,0.7856,0.2554,5.0179,1.8393,0.0043,0.0212,0.1995,0.006,1.2077,4.6827,1.3521,1.8699,5.8602,6.5945,3.2477,3.7515,0.4599,0.9273,0.8248,2.1067,0.3746,6.2887,0.7819,3.2811,4.7412,1.1605,1.2495,6.3896,0.379,0.3523,3.6425,2.3266,5.6302,0.148,3.9498,2.131,2.2985,2.6422,0.4773,3.2985,3.063,0.5353,0.4349,1.2689,2.1114,0.9218,1.228,0.737,5.6032,5.216,10.2054,4.0455,5.9882,4.0588,0.9842,1.5996,5.7141,1.6601,4.5996,1.4254,0.0164,1.062,1.7559,0.895,2.0162,3.1591,0.5818,0.4328,3.0092,3.5927,1.2246,1.4075,6.0568,0.0847,4.2859,2.646,5.6005,2.6148,0.0117,3.8979,2.8654,5.0382,7.7154,3.0653,1.3303,4.1665,2.2557,1.154,6.1414,0.9646,3.0647,5.2915,0.0723,2.2215,2.803,0.171,0.0227,2.9899,5.489,1.6673,3.2221,6.5262,1.8296,4.8705,0.55,2.0112,0.8319,0.6712,0.1069,3.2259,1.902,5.5025,1.3085,1.1914,3.6749,2.6604,1.0129,1.1025,1.2552,4.4972,1.8323,0.3273,5.8958,1.3051,0.5407,0.941,2.6885,1.6759,3.2287,0.4092,4.9655,3.196,0.6544,1.1281,0.0074,1.098,1.3771,0.98,1.285,3.0006,3.4363,1.0196,0.2517,5.5628,1.9063,1.8765,5.6794,7.1237,0.829,1.1088,3.7465,1.6987,0.3385,0.0056,0.0035,0.2013,0.5977,2.9602,0.9556,3.4546,1.0158,3.3698,1.14,2.385,3.6112,1.6522,3.085,6.8239,2.2712,0.4478,0.8568,3.7989,0.0019,1.0237,0.4597,0.5916,3.7805,2.3541,5.2135,0.0014,4.7965,2.1498,1.9333,2.8188,5.4595,1.4634,2.5472,0.5958,4.4599,0.2124,6.8726,0.3948,3.4392,0.7237,2.3373,0.0024,2.5117,2.0509,2.6206,6.0948,3.1843,2.1262,2.1166,6.259,3.7639,1.8667,2.7979,4.1643,3.5833,7.7446,2.6982,3.1055,0.6491,4.729,1.317,0.5723,2.374,2.44,2.6061,1.9564,2.3826,3.2907,2.5098,4.569,1.9877,4.2845,1.1759,2.3722,1.9585,0.6501,0.3492,0.2845,4.7965,0.7715,4.978,0.5626,1.3652,3.8086,1.0521,3.739,1.7047,1.2214,2.4159,1.3254,1.3784,1.2265,0.3084,1.6817,3.0689,5.9592,3.1222,3.5945,3.7381,0.4225,5.3392,1.9286,7.3697,0.866,1.0803,1.5241,2.1907,4.0333,0.9846,2.8015,2.4446,2.078,3.3475,1

At a private dinner Monday evening attended by House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the president urged lawmakers to move quickly and craft bipartisan tax proposals.\nAt the same time, Mr. McConnell indicated House negotiations could take some time. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the president\u2019s thinking, but if there\u2019s a deal, I\u2019m going to make sure it gets done,\u201d he said.\nThe president\u2019s personal attorney, his top economic adviser and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Tuesday their discussions were \u201cmoving toward a deal.\u201d\nMr. Mnuchin said the President will remain open to a Republican compromise but also warned there was \u201cno guarantee\u201d of a deal.\nMr. Trump told reporters Monday after the meeting that he would only sign legislation that was \u201cgood for the American people.\u201d\nA key focus for negotiations on both sides remains how to increase tax cuts for middle-income families, which Republicans argue will boost economic growth.\nSen. Charles Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, urged his Senate colleagues to work toward a compromise. \u201cI have to assume if there\u2019s a bill it will be a bill that is in-line with what Sen. McConnell and Mr. Trump are proposing,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cAnd therefore I think we will see a bill as part of the deal that Sen. McConnell is hoping for as well.\u201d\nMr. Markey, meanwhile, said the Republican tax proposals that are now circulating in the Senate have an \u201cabsurd amount of tax breaks and giveaways\u201d for businesses. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening today is a Republican tax bill where we have a plan to break up the middle class,\u201d he said.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are each expected to pass a major tax law before the end of the year, with a final version likely going to President Donald Trump for signature.\nDemocrats hope to get ahead of Republicans this season, passing their own bill in the first part of the year and making it easier for Republicans to resist key changes.\nBoth parties have promised increased revenues through lower rates, a wider variety of tax credits and other changes to taxpayers\u2019 returns.\nSen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Washington state, has been advocating for the inclusion of \u201cvalue-added taxes\u201d to be levied on certain goods and services to help fund public schools.

Mets fans will know he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the man we voted for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless he breaks every rule. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominations have earned his support and condemnation in equal measure. Most of them, however, come amid the storm of a White House impeachment inquiry. The Trump administration is adding new COVID-19 restrictions in Florida, California, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Washington as well as reinstating statewide masks in the West, and loosening some regulations in Texas and Utah.\nFortunately for the public, it seems that the Trump Administration may have just appointed a Justice Department that has been working in unison and bringing an unprecedented unity back to an overblown, dysfunctional bureaucracy. A federal judge has ordered officials in the Trump Department of Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Division to return the classified memoranda associated with a controversial meeting with the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On Wednesday, December 15, Justice Minister David Lametti announced that Justice Anthony Kennedy will succeed Loretta Lynch as the United States Attorney General. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Obama and his team were looking for a way to continue lying, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to go for war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it will take more than the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political power \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to require the American people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political power. MORE on that coming Friday, with the former head of the FBI and some of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest police chiefs on the show.\nThe Trump administration and congressional Republicans are attempting to strip Democrats of the only powerful tool they have to fight President Donald Trump. A federal judge has ordered officials in the Trump Department of Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Division to return the classified memoranda associated with a controversial meeting with the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who the Department of Justice ultimately accused of lying to the FBI about Russian contacts. MORE on that also Friday, with national security adviser John Bolton and others speaking on the show.\nA federal judge has ordered officials in the Trump administration's National Security Division to return the classified memoranda associated with a controversial meeting with the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The move follows a complaint brought by a New York City lawyer, who said that the memoranda were given to his client because of their possible relevance to a recent lawsuit. While this sounds like a bad idea, the new law has some advantages to it. As recently as 2017, the Obama administration, under pressure from Congress, attempted to repeal the so-called Magnitsky Act after it helped a former Russian government agent named Yuri Magnitsky escape to the U.S.\nThe Justice Department, a few months ago, requested that the former head of the FBI and some of the nation's biggest police chiefs on the show. MORE on that coming Friday, with the former head of the FBI and some of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest police chiefs on the show.

The strikes pounded","text":"Air strikes killed 19 people in a village in Syria s rebel stronghold of Idlib overnight, a rescue service there and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday. The strikes pounded a rural town in Idlib city and took place overnight Wednesday as the besieged besieged town of Khan Sheikhun was battered by air strikes. The attack killed 19 civilians and wounded others, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing a doctor in Khan Sheikhun. It was the deadliest day in the eight months of war in Idlib, where the Syrian government retaliated in a barrage of air strikes Wednesday on rebel positions. The strikes hit rebel-held territory of Idlib, the main rebel stronghold in southern Syria, the Observatory said. They came amid the ongoing U.N.-brokered talks on Syria to defuse a possible humanitarian crisis caused by a seven-month war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives. Assad blames civilians for the latest round of violence, despite the sprouting hope that he may be holding off regime strikes on rebel-held villages this week.\nIn what amounts to a coup d etat, the Venezuelan government forced the departure from the presidency of Hugo Chavez on Thursday and imposed a junta of military officers led by General Vladimir Rodriguez Torres, spokesman Hugo Villegas said. The government had declared Mr. Chavez unfit to govern because of an ongoing battle with illness. The junta will operate under a three-year plan drawn up by Mr. Villegas and includes an economic reform package aimed at reviving the economy, Mr. Villegas said. Among other measures, the junta announced that some economic responsibilities will now shift to the oil minister and that the economy will be led by a three-member committee formed by a prime minister, treasury secretary and foreign minister. Mr Chavez has been suffering from cancer, and the regime has been struggling to persuade some doctors to test his blood for tumors. He is expected to pass on soon. Mr Ch\u00e1vez called Thursday from Cuba to announce a new interim government, the day after he issued an executive decree that paved the way for the seizure of the presidential palace and the Supreme Court. It also called on the military to take charge of the judiciary and said he would call a presidential referendum as soon as possible. The decree was widely interpreted as a tacit endorsement of the junta. After a tumultuous weekend with accusations of coup plots, the military launched an assault on the palace and then on the Supreme Court building. With a small army and no backup, the military attempted to storm the palace with grenades, tear gas and gunfire, but were driven out. The military also stormed the courts, killing the chief justice and others and prompting the arrest of government officials who were part of a failed coup attempt days earlier. The Venezuelan government has denied any involvement in the coup, and said the actions of the military \" were contrary to the provisions of the law and our institutions.\" The White House said that it was not commenting on the current military coup on Venezuela until the junta has issued a statement addressing the U.S. government as well as Venezuelans. Mr Chavez has long been at odds with Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who leads the military. Mr Maduro and the junta have blamed Mr Ch\u00e1vez for launching a currency and government policy change planned in September but never implemented, but Mr Ch\u00e1vez has said he would be the deciding factor on appointments to key sectors of the Venezuelan economy and in foreign policy. Mr Chavez said that the military- led junta will hold \" a referendum as soon as possible to make any alterations necessary in our constitutional order or laws affecting the rights and freedoms of our

The 86-year-old Democrat is a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Levin said he planned to leave office in mid-October and announce his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2024. \u201cCongress, as America\u2019s main policy-making authority, is critical to fulfilling the basic hopes and dreams of millions of American families,\u201d Levin said in a statement released Saturday. Levin, whose term ends next year, said politics \u201cneeds to be played \u2026 the way the American people have long been accustomed to it\u201d and that there were times when he disagreed with certain decisions that \u201cneed to be made.\u201d He said he is \u201clooking forward to having a full life after the Senate, helping to govern in a bipartisan fashion and putting faith in our people as we move forward.\u201d Levin has represented Michigan since 1992. He has had several starring roles in the House and Senate, and has been a key voice in the effort to get a bill through the House that would have increased military spending and supported the troops in Afghanistan. The American flag fluttered from Congress Monday morning during Levin\u2019s swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol. This week on TODAY: The coronavirus is taking a real toll on our economy. But Americans have also had to deal with a second wave of illness. When is Congress coming back? And how do you make the best use of tax dollars in your community? In an exclusive interview, Katie Couric talks to Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Patrick Leahy before they are sworn into office. We also speak with the incoming chairs of the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees about their priorities.\nTrump administration to impose additional tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum, with the exception of Canada and Mexico, because its policies \u201chave harmed U.S. industries.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tariff policy is getting even more expensive on American products, increasing the pressure on U.S. factory managers to make their steel and aluminum more competitively priced to avoid higher duties.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move marks the first time in 15 years to apply duties on steel and aluminum imports, as part of its campaign to boost American manufacturing.\n\u201cOur domestic steel and aluminum industries face competitive pressure from many countries around the world, and the administration\u2019s actions today reflect its goal of protecting our U.S. industries. While the administration is making good on this commitment, it should pause and reexamine its decision to impose similar duties on some Mexico-bound imports,\u201d said NAFTA Policy Project Director Kevin D.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump will strike a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers , choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal in","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump will strike a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal in its latest attempt to get Washington to lift sanctions.\nBut Trump has made an unprecedented, unbalanced decision that could potentially lead to military confrontation, analysts warned, even though Trump has been trying to find a path back to the deal that was rejected by much of the nuclear establishment.\nThe decision by Trump to ignore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was the latest episode in a months-long saga to try and bring the U.S. back into the nuclear deal that he reneged on last year.\nTrump has been trying to find ways to get Washington back into the nuclear deal and has given hints that he might do so using a presidential order to temporarily pause the sanctions imposed under the deal and allow Iran's economy to function smoothly.\nBut the sanctions will not be lifted after the Trump administration certifies on Friday that Tehran is complying fully with the nuclear deal. If the U.S. does not certify, the sanctions under the pact will remain in effect.\nIran has said that its compliance with the deal is only possible if Trump comes back on board. Trump, a longtime critic of the deal, has been trying to get pressure on his former allies for months, including with promises of military action, to come back to the deal.\nTrump and others are trying to get Trump out of the agreement while others are trying to keep him out, according to the analysis.\nIn a statement Friday it said it was \"deeply disappointed that after more than a year of talks and preparation, it is likely that the United States is not going to comply with the requirements. The European Union and the global community, including the United Nations, should prepare to take action and immediately implement their obligations... until the United States does \".\nThe European Union has threatened that on Friday it will take an \"appropriate reaction\" to Trump's rejection of the deal as soon as he signs off. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated earlier Thursday that Washington intended to reject the deal if sanctions were not removed.\nThe Europeans - which include Britain, France, Germany and Russia - also said they did not expect Trump to stand by the deal at the weekend.\nFor its part, France said Trump should go through with the process on Friday and it would not step up sanctions against Iran.\nThe leaders of Britain, Germany and France have said that Washington should honor its commitments to the agreement and that Tehran should restore confidence in the accord.\nSome international observers said Trump's decision could end up looking like a breakaway from international rules, given that most countries are already imposing additional sanctions and Trump's rejection of the U.N.-led agreement would send a strong message that the United States wants to stay out.\n\"We can see a strong signal sent by the U.S. to leave the agreement, and other countries may follow suit,\" said David M. Schoenbaum, a fellow at the Washington Center for Non-proliferation, a US research organization.\n\"In this case, it would be a breakaway from international law. But what might happen if Trump does not follow through with his assurances that he will do so at the end of the day,\" Schoenbaum said.\nWashington is in an \"unprecedented position\" of negotiating with Iran, Schoenbaum noted.\nBut with so much at stake, there may not be time to reengage, which could result in a further weakening of the

Bush has said he supports the move to Jerusalem but that the move might still have to take place through a separate legislative process.\nThe White House has urged Congress to support the Jerusalem

Trump s State Department moved last week to replace Jerusalem as Israel s capital with a temporary official embassy in the holy city as part of a shift in U.S. policy that has been under pressure from both sides of Israel s political line.\nWhen it was signed by President Trump on January 20 before a joint session of Congress, Trump said in a statement that the declaration will end hostilities between Israel and its neighboring countries.\nDuring the signing, Trump said, I acknowledge Israel s legitimate concern for its security, and I commit to working with you and other friendly nations to resolve it.\nAs Trump said, the move represented a turning point in one of the most complex conflicts on Earth s geopolitical landscape.\nTrump continued, I want you to know that your concerns about the future have nothing to do with who I am, whether I am a Jew or not.\nAccording to the declaration, the U.S. also said that the recognition by the Trump administration of Jerusalem doesn t have a political connection with Palestinian rights, and that the U.S. recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns about Jerusalem.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan of Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey calls on Prime Minister Biniamin Netanyahu of Israel in Moscow, Russia, in August 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Egemen Balci\nAnd it ended, he had been a very big mistake, it wasn t right to establish relations with the Zionist entity, the U.S. embassy in the holy city of Jerusalem, the capital of the Zionist entity.\nA month later when Netanyahu was still the prime minister, the U.S. embassy moved in and a Trump ally was appointed as ambassador to the U.S.\nNow in June 19 he signed a new order to establish a political representation of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, meaning that when he left the White House, he had officially recognized one of Jerusalem s most controversial borders.\nAt the moment, the Trump administration has still not granted recognition to Jerusalem as a capital of the Palestinian state. According to the declaration, the US recognizes Jerusalem as one of Israel s capital and will continue to do so until it reacts.\nThe announcement took place even as Israel made another move in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu signed another decision on Monday to continue to recognize the status of Jerusalem as Israel s capital, even though its status as the final capital of the Jewish people has already been resolved.\nThe declaration also reiterated that the US will keep the state of Israel occupied and under occupation.\nWe see the Palestinians as a people under occupation, we want to see the Palestinians under the rule and protection of the UN.\nThis is the largest victory for the Palestinians as a whole since Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital and has been trying to stop its annexation of Palestinian territories.\nWhile Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has refused to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a number of European countries have done that.\nAfrican countries have also recognized Jerusalem as the final capital of the Israeli state and called on the Palestinians to recognize Jerusalem, saying that the US recognizes Jerusalem as one of Israel s capital, which is not the same as a capital.\nMeanwhile, the European Union has promised to continue to support the Palestinians who seek recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of their state.\nHe came close to being president, but now it has been reversed and the U.S. has taken back its embassy in Jerusalem. President Trump, he said, made a very big mistake.","token_len":737,"entropy":[7.8318,3.977,0.1934,5.2072,1.2166,6.1232,1.83,0.3364,5.9336,3.5604,0.1161,0.3193,0.0169,0.0481,3.1213,3.1557,1.9736,3.1998,2.8573,1.752,2.7477,0.0962,1.7059,6.6034,3.8914,0.7167,7.8669,1.7027,1.4758,1.044,1.1342,12.2049,0.724,0.3792,6.6373,8.8859,7.0621,0.2539,7.3445,5.2873,0.4138,0.0845,7.097,2.2021,0.8042,1.6836,0.7625,0.0953,1.3389,2.2926,5.0412,6.7461,5.8875,0.8388,2.1769,5.8245,0.101,4.9164,1.6537,0.0015,1.0899,5.7749,1.6449,1.1257,0.0406,0.0356,0.2326,0.4048,4.0106,1.5166,2.0464,4.3526,2.6137,0.3887,3.4549,1.8677,1.4387,6.2649,3.9386,3.3986,4.0503,0.2897,1.1176,15.0131,3.9972,1.7452,6.0893,2.2729,2.3003,1.8639,2.2781,3.7505,1.8846,8.1233,2.7382,2.7162,0.318,0.0555,0.1963,0.5239,2.4816,2.262,3.5513,0.5805,0.8965,0.9559,1.3744,5.8445,4.0513,5.2756,5.612,1.2469,0.6174,0.0917,3.6541,5.3829,2.9413,1.1162,0.7575,5.9797,1.2627,4.3456,1.7591,1.4571,1.3711,1.8577,9.3826,7.8057,3.4255,1.1958,5.4991,6.4143,2.7333,1.5134,1.7651,1.5503,1.2913,1.3279,6.2933,0.4699,2.9486,0.3726,4.6352,1.8815,2.1979,8.0858,0.3843,0.3271,3.032,5.0758,1.7995,1.0883,4.9449,6.2003,2.2933,0.7108,2.1593,3.2404,6.7276,0.7305,5.0203,0.0246,0.5098,7.4643,0.0564,0.6029,0.8948,5.2132,3.4548,2.9301,1.7587,4.772,7.2254,2.173,0.4405,0.672,1.9368,5.4262,1.2129,7.6213,3.4818,3.0359,0.247,1.9546,0.5759,5.3224,7.0096,1.8267,1.3394,3.4917,6.1625,2.2428,0.0345,0.0024,0.0025,4.9835,3.1741,0.2881,1.6233,4.6474,1.1537,0.8967,2.6008,3.3595,0.5821,1.502,0.7607,1.1004,6.2819,0.0283,1.5528,5.5233,0.3044,1.2736,1.9971,0.0016,0.0071,0.0517,6.3649,5.5779,1.2968,1.6984,3.5453,4.2551,1.0627,6.6078,0.481,0.452,0.2073,10.0082,1.443,3.7943,3.6991,4.1643,6.3807,1.4896,5.7242,3.781,1.7597,1.55,0.7738,1.4144,1.6468,0.0011,0.0079,0.0402,3.078,3.6481,2.2501,2.7004,3.8941,3.5068,0.919,3.0791,2.1141,0.9411,0.3018,7.4784,0.3906,1.3556,0.0092,6.0394,16.3263,2.1551,0.0154,0.9638,1.1409,0.2561,6.5878,0.8213,10.5765,0.0026,11.8048,16.2488,5.1717,4.0806,0.9967,0.4559,4.0825,6.1979,2.3124,3.2845,0.5139,3.1203,4.5002,6.9179,0.118,8.5706,0.942,1.7933,0.0412,4.0187,8.7067,11.519,6.666,7.3983,1.0895,11.114,3.9739,7.4981,3.5533,2.9456,7.4436,6.3937,5.5081,5.8141,5.2108,9.6775,1.5692,4.4165,4.7619,0.7907,6.9776,1.2022,7.7049,5.4648,0.2208,2.0118,4.9565,1.9316,2.2503,3.1371,3.0747,0.0078,0.0251,0.4391,5.8406,0.5441,2.7665,1.3129,0.1335,1.0436,0.04,1.14,3.3378,6.1003,0.3307,1.4563,4.2546,1.2605,1.5706,0.3845,4.2057,4.8852,0.7779,5.9832,2.759,2.2521,4.0046,2.9712,1.5997,0.0256,1.4005,1.9844,1.2409,0.0007,0.0042,0.0425,1.8183,3.973,2.7858,2.7761,4.9426,6.5082,5.3027,2.6725,2.1358,1.836,1.5021,0.541,1.5704,1.7325,0.0009,0.3715,0.2937,1.336,4.8743,4.1162,6.028,6.898,5.0474,3.6717,0.9686,2.8027,4.3251,2.5671,3.4722,1.3112,6.6315,7.6342,1.3894,0.843,1.8995,0.0008,0.0044,0.2125,2.0127,0.2489,0.3761,1.4559,6.2393,0.9049,5.1942,2.4777,4.1522,2.1822,0.8948,0.0014,1.4504,1.2852,2.5038,4.8583,3.0136,7.4962,0.4092,3.1519,1.9601,2.6712,4.9502,4.938,1.0544,0.3166,4.9792,0.7127,4.1133,0.788,1.3809,3.4591,0.5072,1.6708,5.7131,0.3752,5.8368,3.1406,0.3665,0.7624,1.1289,2.6259,1.0977,0.6065,1.3017,2.3605,0.8186,1.3534,6.106,0.0057,1.24,2.9548,0.1996,1.0109,5.0316,3.979,0.7332,0.2107,4.3027,0.0416,1.7049,0.2101,4.8346,1.7272,3.7738,2.0422,0.1764,1.8461,0.0152,2.3802,1.4895,10.0573,2.8459,0.2755,2.1585,4.1852,5.3493,0.3594,6.2317,1.7452,3.114,5.0217,4.5148,1.2984,2.3467,4.4027,2.6274,5.2675,0.0075,1.9233,3.8169,5.1543,4.9625,2.0969,3.061,1.2536,6.731,1.4997,1.6441,1.4012,4.2779,0.4081,0.4723,0.1797,1.0443,0.1026,0.0538,1.4259,4.3258,0.6114,5.0691,1.6061,1.2014,1.8449,5.7606,1.485,0.3601,0.9406,1.0781,2.2675,2.1692,3.6225,0.274,5.3172,0.532,0.3033,2.0192,4.1737,1.7283,5.656,1.1127,1.1416,2.8009,1.4185,5.1628,2.547,5.2181,0.2889,0.3011,7.1493,2.2459,4.8125,2.0858,2.3067,0.7073,7.7014,5.257,1.8404,5.6682,1.5458,1.6224,2.6375,4.91,2.4395,1.3344,3.3041,3.9076,0.9407,2.4719,2.0487,2.8442,4.6913,2.7347,1.4432,4.4263,3.2775,0.0299,0.7227,5.5628,1.6232,1.4828,4.0233,1.0044,1.9661,6.5623,4.9684,1.0142,0.985,1.4222,4.5544,0.8019,3.2323,3.0113,9.8991,6.3426,0.9749,0.5954,1.1167,0.1883,0.0882,2.7758,4.1326,2.8926,3.2489,0.1723,4.4746,5.2177,3.1364,1.587,2.3695,2.8677,1.0166,0.4521,4.9158,8.1627,0.2265,1.1628,0.0133,0.0134,2.9526,5.564,0.1111,1.1123,0.5607,0.2494,0.8819,0.0726,0.0374,0.4534,4.6184,2.9068,0.0236,3.9425,1.1592,0.7521,2.7283,5.7077,1.1476,0.8593,8.3074,1.6165,1.769,1.1261,4.1461,0.5162,0.1678,1.4336,5.3013,0.1539,0.1193,0.678,5.4703,1.1799,1.9886,5.2774,0.8313,1.0838,4.223,0.1475,2.3987,1.81,4.7234,3.7523,1.0426,1.7936,4.1369,3.8167,1.2042,0.1392,3.796,0.0222,0.9017,0.071,0.3468,2.6095,3.2477,1.5083,3.1928,2.2774,1.5906,0.1454,2.3434,1.6606,2.9463,0.3065,5.5567,0.5882,1.8817,2.7754,0.1216,1.2625,6.428,0.5153,3.1803,0.6284,1.4904,0.8222,2.1234,4.1105,3.5424,4.7318,0.5111,0.5335,0.3115,1.2271,0.3542,0.0793,1.4855,0.7832,0.7652,0.6114,6.5035,6.6783,3.0002,0.2457,5.4683,5.8308,2.4727,1.1293,3.6934,3.3614,2.5434,1.9759,5.1708,2.322,1.7134,2.3067,0.0009,0.0201,0.052,1.6635,3.9757

The vice mayor of","text":"Fire swept through a shopping mall in the Philippines killing at least 37 people, most of them workers at a call center, city government officials said on Sunday. The vice mayor of Davao City told news agency AFP that the mall was also burning but had not yet been evacuated. Firefighters are still battling the blaze in downtown Davao, which is a major commercial hub and has been ravaged by decades of neglect. Officials said the fire could be attributed to a computer malfunction at the call center that caused multiple alarms to go off, according to the local Davao Tribune newspaper. \u201cIt is unknown what the cause of the fire is, \u201d the president of the Philippines\u2019 National Volunteer Fire Department, Manuel Muno Jr., told AFP in Davao. \u201cThe firefighters are still battling it. We want to see who is the culprit. \u2026 There is a possibility of a computer malfunction. They are doing their investigation. \u201d Muno told reporters at the hospital that the victims, mostly telecom workers, were mostly found near the entrance. \u201cSome are still being taken from the roof to the ground,\u201d Muno said. Two people were said to have been injured. Officials said the mall, which is located on the main street of Davao\u2019s business district, was partially destroyed by the fire. Muno said he ordered the removal of security cameras at the mall \u201cso that the authorities can examine them for clues.\u201d\nA man with a short golden beard who wore a white shirt and a white apron was seen at the scene before he was carried away under a protective tarpaulin. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, was due to travel to Davao later Sunday to help officials with the firefight. \u201cWe have already sent a team there,\u201d Duterte told reporters from Davao, the epicenter of a decade of unrest in the southern Philippines, the country\u2019s second-most-populous region. \u201cThere is a lot of damage in this area. We want to get this done immediately,\u201d the president added. The fire broke out just after 3:30 pm on Saturday, killing 37 people and nearly 50 injured, according to information from city officials, who estimated an additional 50 had been rushed to hospital. \u201cThey have found the body of a dead girl,\u201d the vice mayor, Jose Santos, a former Davao City mayor, told Reuters by phone, speaking at least under the condition of anonymity. \u201cThere have been many victims.\u201d The bodies were removed from the fire scene with helicopters, Santos said, adding that many of those killed were people who were only mildly injured at the start of the blaze. The explosion, which caused a strong stench in the air, was so powerful that windows were blown out into neighboring buildings. \u201cMany people were seriously injured,\u201d Santos said. \u201cThere is no sign of life. But many of the people that are being injured are mild ones.\u201d Police said the fire was being actively smothered with water. One man died on the third floor of a five-story building that was just about to be evacuated, Santos said. One man who came out of the mall was struck in his head by the explosion and died there, the vice mayor said. \u201cThere are several people that are in critical condition,\u201d Santos said. \u201cA young man is in critical condition.

{"prompt":"Some mosques in Uzbekistan are starting to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer from loudspeakers for the first time in a decade as they take advantage of a more tolerant official attitude toward Islam since","text":"Some mosques in Uzbekistan are starting to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer from loudspeakers for the first time in a decade as they take advantage of a more tolerant official attitude toward Islam since independence from Russia in 1991, the first of many changes in Uzbekistan\u2019s attitude toward Islam. As a consequence of the recent changes in the religious landscape, the mosques in Uzbekistan are starting to spread Islamic music and sound effects of the call to prayer using loudspeakers. It is, according to reports, the first time in almost ten years that mosques have started to broadcast the call to prayer on loudspeakers.\nI am one of those who do not have any religion and I still find these mosques quite fascinating. Some people I meet in Uzbekistan, however, find this to be strange and don\u2019t understand why I feel these religious buildings to be so strange.\nWhen I was in Uzbekistan, and before that in Afghanistan, I never found all of those sound effects so strange. One night, for example, I was watching the religious fireworks on television and when I heard the call to prayer, I found it to be amazing and I didn\u2019t feel it strange at all. This was a completely different way of praying and I am still not sure why.\nToday, however, I find it extremely strange. Nowadays, many people do not feel that they are obliged to go pray at the mosque on the Sunday.\nThe most popular and most widely used language in Uzbekistan is Uzbek. The language is also often spoken by people living in the central plains of Uzbekistan, in the provinces of Zarafshan, Fergana, and Samarkand. Turkic people from neighboring Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Trans-Caucasus speak Uzbek. Turkic people living in Uzbekistan speak Uzbek because they were forced to learn the Uzbekspeak. Uzbekistan\u2019s most spoken language in the capital is Russian.\nUzbek culture in the West is still very new and some are suspicious of Uzbek history and culture. In particular, Uzbeks in the West are accused of being chauvinists. A large number of Uzbeks speak English, French, and German, and they are trying to get their country to be more well-known in the rest of the world.\nUzbek people are very brave people. There is more courage among them than among the other Central Asian peoples because of the strong past experience with the Russians.\nThe Uzbek history is very old. The whole country was called Kirguiz in the medieval period. After that, the Turkic tribes settled in it. In the second half of the 19th century, the Persian governor of Uzbekistan tried to colonize Tashkent. The Uzbek rebelled and the Persian governor was killed. The Russians entered Uzbekistan during the first war against the Turks and were present to support the Uzbek army.\nIn 1921, Uzbekistan gained its independence as a republic. In 1993, the Uzbek parliament, which was called the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic, was transferred to the Republic of the Central Asian Republics. In 2004, with the help of the Russian army, President Islam Karimov restored his power to the parliament. Later that year, Uzbek citizens began to protest against the government of Islam Karimov. The government began to close down the political opposition and to persecute the activists on the Internet.

{"prompt":"U.S . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will recommend on Aug. 24 whether to eliminate or shrink nearly two dozen national monuments , creating the first major test for a 111-year-old law that gives presidents the","text":"U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will recommend on Aug. 24 whether to eliminate or shrink nearly two dozen national monuments, creating the first major test for a 111-year-old law that gives presidents the flexibility to impose their own rules on land.\nHe is expected to recommend that the monuments be reduced from a total of 50 and that 19 of them be completely closed off or severely diminished by the end of the year, according to a Washington Post report Sunday.\nMost of the monuments were first established when President Theodore Roosevelt, having promised to protect them, made them a key part of what came to be known as the Great Outdoors Act, which was enacted in 1916 and was meant to be permanent.\nBut a federal court order in 1992 ordered that they be reevaluated every five years for potential revisions or alterations. Congress has been charged with determining whether a monument should be closed down or eliminated.\nThe monuments in question are in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Washington states.\nSome of the monuments in the southern states \u2014 the Grand Staircase Escalante in Utah, Mount Wilson in California and the San Juan Islands in Washington \u2014 were closed to the public more than 60 years ago. An archeological dig site in Arizona\u2019s Grand Canyon is nearing a permanent closure.\nThe decision is the first major test in decades of the Great Outdoors Act. The law was not even enforced by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson or Nixon.\nWhen asked on Friday whether he was ready to make any recommendations for the future of the law, Zinke said, \u201cI\u2019m not there yet.\u201d\nA handful of national parks will be closed as a group, while individual monuments can be closed off as they are assessed for potential changes, he said.\n\u201cAll of the grand staircase monuments can be closed,\u201d Zinke said Friday. \u201cAll these monuments have very severe threats and there\u2019s no question that they are going to have to be closed to the public.\u201d\nZinke said he wants to make sure the current closures of some monuments are appropriate, but said it still depends on the president.\nNavy officials said Friday they are conducting a survey in areas of the San Juan Islands. They said no decision has been made as to whether the islands and the surrounding ocean park will be closed in order to safeguard military facilities and prevent oil pollution.\nThe president has discretion over national monuments. If he believes they pose a risk to federal property, military installations or national security, he can close them.\nThe monuments are being considered in light of a surge in oil discoveries off the California coast. The U.S. Coast Guard has stopped oil and natural gas drilling in the area that the National Marine Fisheries Service has been trying to preserve for its national marine sanctuary.\nZinke said Friday that military and national security protection was being prioritized and that he would \u201chave a great conversation\u201d about the San Juan Islands with President Obama.\nIn Arizona, Zinke said that the federal government plans to use about $3 million from the National Parks Conservation Fund in the Grand Canyon for restoration work.\nOther monuments will be closed in the coming months or years. Zinke said Friday that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would close more than 1,200 acres at the Grand Staircase Escalante by the end of 2016 and that the National Park Service would eventually close Mount Wilson, a 2,650-foot-high granite peak in the Sierra Nevada Mountains that is a popular backpacking destination.","token_len":739,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.6776,1.6164,0.4957,0.0,0.0001,3.9432,6.6263,4.5031,4.7302,0.0058,3.816,2.7118,0.4092,5.7029,2.3602,6.8772,6.6143,3.4757,0.284,6.1887,0.2076,1.9525,7.0657,3.6321,2.9695,3.0699,5.8246,1.6938,2.7559,11.9667,0.0437,0.8851,0.2746,0.014,2.3258,1.1604,4.2959,2.3243,1.3046,5.7695,0.0749,5.6185,2.2825,1.0718,2.4691,1.2692,2.6786,1.3187,0.3774,18.8538,2.5245,1.1654,0.0085,3.6734,2.0524,1.4074,4.4094,0.6076,3.578,2.8598,4.1304,1.7207,0.0973,4.2896,6.2479,1.85,10.1257,1.3574,0.4967,0.2789,4.8756,3.2292,3.7917,3.3737,5.7175,5.8729,3.0849,1.6885,1.4978,0.0014,0.7914,1.2544,1.6957,2.5827,0.0016,1.3646,5.2669,0.1093,0.8771,5.5657,0.1542,0.3494,6.8156,0.5818,0.2281,0.9379,3.5484,5.5986,2.8703,4.7685,1.0997,1.7649,0.0041,3.3774,7.106,6.9661,0.6228,2.4556,1.8867,1.0387,4.353,2.6197,2.1519,3.8041,0.5547,0.0012,5.6963,5.6979,0.0337,0.0263,0.088,0.0079,0.2461,1.8336,9.2899,0.7025,2.2245,2.754,0.6326,2.3428,2.4936,0.4786,5.6625,2.1348,2.7511,3.8572,0.0281,4.2677,4.6,0.4179,0.4931,1.469,3.9489,3.6032,2.0059,5.9434,1.6278,4.2525,2.8421,1.602,3.2609,0.2739,4.2933,3.7307,0.0024,4.4638,1.8881,0.038,3.986,5.6385,9.7706,3.138,4.0111,0.8929,5.3376,1.8822,3.1439,7.1373,0.0971,4.7813,1.5324,2.4172,0.9413,1.3291,0.3969,2.1099,2.8064,1.0751,4.6666,1.2407,0.2736,1.9046,3.1134,4.5253,0.0594,1.0901,2.7642,4.7498,0.2364,2.5294,0.1561,1.8154,0.1162,1.6787,0.0646,3.7547,0.0447,0.1128,1.2233,0.1248,1.155,0.3037,8.3471,1.402,1.3266,5.4323,0.2718,0.6051,4.4937,1.3664,0.3808,1.261,3.4807,3.3136,6.6068,2.0935,3.9575,2.7361,2.5856,1.3662,0.0013,0.0029,8.1375,0.0055,0.018,2.0466,1.6781,0.5346,4.9059,7.0148,0.4748,3.5536,0.8286,0.9241,4.653,0.7991,2.591,0.5409,2.0689,0.5493,1.7907,4.7534,2.6891,0.9541,0.0342,5.8099,0.1206,4.4966,0.0197,0.0196,0.9839,6.1549,6.5347,0.2858,3.3269,6.3178,1.0837,2.8404,16.8486,7.4023,4.8916,1.8893,0.6565,2.8693,6.7242,6.2744,4.1515,1.133,1.0832,0.3724,1.6454,4.4359,2.9206,2.651,1.5116,2.1553,3.5791,3.8674,3.5989,1.275,1.7974,7.0213,0.2568,0.0001,0.1033,1.4307,1.9746,1.9843,1.6814,5.5078,5.4351,4.6618,2.6384,5.2947,3.3242,1.7379,1.9219,1.2009,2.3841,3.3309,2.1773,1.2782,0.5351,5.9447,4.673,3.4757,2.8649,1.0894,1.0447,2.8673,3.319,0.1147,2.9985,2.8182,3.0615,3.562,1.8613,4.1324,0.5364,0.8221,4.4925,0.1691,1.124,0.0006,0.658,1.7213,11.6592,6.2876,4.6226,10.305,4.8278,1.9375,1.124,5.1315,0.131,0.8088,2.9221,7.4635,0.6239,4.6836,6.3698,0.0181,4.5185,3.0462,4.4512,1.3437,0.6743,3.6669,1.4184,7.933,1.3408,3.764,7.7289,1.1148,3.9517,0.4823,2.1296,4.4402,2.7438,3.4844,1.5884,5.3389,4.1698,3.2643,2.5689,1.7442,2.0186,0.2728,0.1523,0.4375,3.8882,1.886,5.3677,1.1031,0.9394,7.5183,11.7749,0.5318,4.7404,0.407,0.8722,2.0752,8.2419,4.4887,1.5979,0.0011,0.2956,6.3025,0.3838,4.9779,0.3426,2.8568,5.4807,1.2856,2.0984,5.7229,5.8033,6.3043,2.7663,3.2882,4.7945,1.5186,0.1589,2.6212,3.8,0.9876,1.3704,1.5095,1.7068,0.0227,2.2088,1.3032,0.2205,1.2712,3.6532,2.1008,0.0578,1.0386,1.7901,2.3584,0.4548,4.2146,0.001,0.0027,1.1666,1.204,4.0167,0.3664,2.2397,0.6847,1.8676,6.073,7.515,3.2388,2.9727,2.1005,0.8094,7.7772,2.0345,1.8095,2.2781,2.8397,6.3043,3.7522,0.088,1.2415,3.188,1.223,0.208,7.3422,4.1021,3.5389,1.4635,2.668,1.8545,1.9098,5.3933,1.0354,5.0232,4.1241,6.0807,2.2178,0.7856,6.9306,0.1965,0.1964,4.3001,2.3647,1.4978,5.1583,2.3895,0.567,0.2598,0.0505,3.0687,0.2363,0.6397,1.6894,4.945,5.1722,1.4137,3.3558,4.9389,8.9271,1.1028,0.4414,0.5141,3.5335,5.3946,0.0552,5.9947,7.2491,3.4034,1.9492,6.3996,6.2114,6.8445,0.6848,0.2638,1.7116,3.6,1.9234,8.7253,2.169,3.7677,0.2675,2.0609,4.4067,1.5774,4.1669,1.6914,3.0993,0.2291,3.7459,0.2265,5.3364,2.9789,0.5981,7.6563,2.1085,0.6873,2.3044,0.5956,0.3164,0.366,0.4943,3.4805,0.1374,0.9532,0.635,1.9792,2.6724,1.739,3.921,2.3663,1.9733,5.0202,0.004,2.1201,6.8895,0.2225,2.2516,5.2505,4.8909,0.2785,4.2434,0.0551,1.5335,2.1002,2.9703,0.0005,0.0024,0.0027,3.1708,0.0013,1.6809,5.6107,3.5366,2.5019,2.2717,0.0041,1.158,1.7442,0.8559,1.3724,5.0279,3.3426,3.9604,4.0381,0.0309,0.0368,2.4566,2.2663,4.2754,0.0399,3.9449,1.6197,5.9061,4.451,3.0975,5.3939,0.638,0.4065,3.2187,0.0006,0.0036,0.5231,4.0875,0.4842,6.4482,3.4905,3.5956,0.6927,6.496,4.5072,3.8788,3.6873,0.001,3.1703,0.8001,1.7003,1.8633,13.8495,0.5321,3.9301,2.1314,4.8825,2.972,3.3822,2.1531,1.8975,1.6604,8.8584,0.0146,0.1683,4.5106,2.1124,1.1619,1.5048,0.3236,3.8098,5.1661,0.1428,3.0634,0.0012,0.3685,2.8767,1.5041,3.4944,0.2132,5.3864,0.0322,4.5212,5.7122,0.6368,3.0337,2.2558,2.946,0.6486,2.411,3.6307,3.503,0.2991,3.5088,1.4062,7.0456,1.3426,3.3315,3.8868,2.3458,1.1732,0.819,6.1319,1.2172,2.5944,0.5401,0.922,2.4696,1.2799,2.5267,0.8009,3.309,0.0675,1.0946,4.2562,0.0011,0.3083,5.5005,0.2287,1.6209,4.0531,0.0012,0.0018,0.003,2.7012,0.0174,0.0011,0.0021,2.2327,4.0422,4.3415,0.2498,2.8985,0.0249,1.9311,4.2679,4.647,1.4091,2.0265,2.1096,0.0026,0.0011,0.2508,0.003,0.0016,6.7141,1.0993,0.0581,0.0011,2.7275,2.3974,2.1503,1.4938,2.53,0.5672,0.0121,0.7048,6.6366,1.0366,8.1975,0.1758,1.8579,2.6771,5.263,0.2049,6.1084,0

{"prompt":"The judge in the bribery trial of Democratic U.S . Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey told a jury on Monday to continue deliberating after the panel said it was unable to reach a unanimous","text":"The judge in the bribery trial of Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey told a jury on Monday to continue deliberating after the panel said it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on key questions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today to give you the opportunity of having every single one of your questions answered,\u201d U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer told the jury, adding that the prosecution\u2019s case had been \u201cthorough and convincing.\u201d\nJudge Breyer said he would hold open deliberations Tuesday. During the two-day deliberations, there would be no cross-examination of witnesses as the jury continued deliberating and could discuss its verdict only with the judge.\nUnder state law, the jury must not conclude it\u2019s reached a verdict before the court determines the amount of time the jury has been given to deliberate and the amount of time it was actually required to deliberate.\nOn Tuesday, Judge Breyer must write a verdict for the jury as soon as possible, typically by Thursday (or sometimes by the next Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the case). The judge could write a final decision as early as Tuesday or later this week or in late November. If the jury reaches a unanimous decision Monday as the prosecution urged, that sentence could be heard by the court in New Jersey on Thursday, according to the judge\u2019s office.\n\u201cIf you reach the unanimous verdict that we have asked you to, this is an all-county jury and you have the ability of the immediate release of his sentence,\u201d said Judge Breyer.\n\u201cAnd I have complete confidence and I believe in you and all of your honesty, your integrity, your willingness to do what\u2019s right. I trust the system that we are operating in, particularly at a district court level. I trust that your words will be kept to, and your answers will give us the ability to try the case, and to find the truth, and to keep this country moving forward,\u201d he added.\nJudge Breyer said he would like to end deliberations Sunday, noting that the jury was likely to meet as scheduled and not be allowed to work beyond 7 PM on Tuesday. The jury has been in deliberations since April 12.\n\u201cSo we want to end our deliberations as early as possible,\u201d he said, adding that the jury had only met one in-person session before the trial began in January.\nThe jury is trying whether Menendez agreed to pay approximately $7 million to settle bribery, racketeering, campaign financing and tax fraud accusations brought against him by a disgruntled former lobbyist who worked for a New Jersey energy firm.\nSome had the defense attorneys on hand, as they usually are when working with juries. Menendez\u2019s attorneys were present during Monday\u2019s session as they have been on each of three jury deliberations so far. They also were there during Tuesday\u2019s deliberations.\n\u201cI respect how we operate. I think that\u2019s the best way for us to do law,\u201d defense attorney Matthew Scharf said.\nMenendez was convicted in March of accepting unusually high rates for a favor he supposedly extended to a businessman who was raising money for his campaign to be elected statewide attorney general in New Jersey.

{"prompt":"Republican U.S .

Republican Senate leaders said that they had agreed on a framework for reducing taxes for households, low-income workers and small businesses......\n... that Republican Bob Corker is still mulling over whether to get behind the 2010 tax bill. The Illinois Democrat said he needs \"more information.\" The Senate version of the tax package features major tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans - and most Republicans at the top of the party spectrum are supportive of it, but there is no assurance that Corker will take it up in the Congress. \u201c We haven \u2019 ve seen it, but \u2019 m not certain I understand it, \u201d Corker said in an interview with CBS \u2019 The Early Show. \u201c I just haven \u2019 t seen enough of it. \u201cI haven \u2019 t seen enough of the workable parts,\u201d he said.\nThe Republican tax package is being put together by a team headed by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley. The plan cuts taxes on corporations at the top rate by 40 billion dollars over 10 years. It also lowers taxes at the bottom by about 50 billion dollars. Both of these initiatives would bring major spending cuts in, but the idea is to use them to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to encourage energy efficiency. The final version of the package will almost certainly be less than the Senate version, which has been criticized for lacking enough spending cuts and tax cuts for middle class Americans. The final package is likely to be a result of compromise. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who has pushed hard for spending cuts, said he was satisfied with the framework and added that Republicans would now need to come up with a way out of their current political deadlock. \u201d There are still a lot of hurdles to overcome, \u201d Wyden said. \u201c But from the standpoint of principle, we are satisfied with the framework of what we agreed on on Wednesday.\u201d\nSenate Republicans and Obama are now dead in the water with the current tax package because there is no plan to fix the debt problem, a bill that Republicans must get on top of in order to come up with a budget deal, if Democrats do. Republicans say that in the current tax package they are not getting any spending cuts for 2010 and that the debt limit should not be touched until the problem is resolved. Republicans and Democrats both said in a letter to the Treasury Department that their plan to fix the debt was not enough to bring this issue to a head. The letter said that the current spending plan in the debt limit bill needs to be replaced with a plan that calls for spending cuts.\nA Republican presidential candidate will not try to change the U.S. debt limit unless he can make the case to voters that he can stop the borrowing deficit on his own. That is the message delivered Tuesday by Republican Iowa Senator Mike Lee, who was asked whether he would run a campaign focused on a debt limit increase if Barack Obama were to win the election in November. Lee said he wanted to be president, but said he would not support a debt limit increase on his own unless the Republicans agreed to follow through on their own party platform. Lee said that the Republican debate on the issue should have been more focused on what the party platform says.\nWhen they are not working together with Obama, Republicans will never get this debt limit issue resolved. What the Democrats are promising in this debt limit issue is not enough to bring the debt limit issues to a head. This agreement is a major defeat for the Republicans.","token_len":740,"entropy":[6.7193,0.0882,0.0354,0.0301,2.6298,5.0215,0.5222,4.8443,1.9143,1.9557,1.3062,2.2512,4.9576,3.0845,1.1275,0.6405,0.6942,1.2218,4.5837,2.218,18.1736,8.002,8.9842,5.7033,3.6429,6.0481,2.1174,6.465,0.3195,5.526,2.3397,4.9263,1.5815,1.9079,4.935,3.7506,2.7772,5.7306,3.4071,2.1179,2.5308,3.6837,2.0726,2.1339,2.9678,1.5401,0.7534,4.2665,1.0546,5.0148,2.5531,1.5642,4.9223,3.3406,8.569,0.1652,0.4232,3.1773,0.2999,2.6061,0.2669,14.5475,1.7719,11.2308,6.3296,5.7447,9.1856,0.0101,3.1034,1.0139,5.9047,0.0005,1.7034,2.0729,0.1751,6.2896,3.1773,1.4574,7.9149,0.7904,1.487,1.1268,3.0604,8.3827,3.3839,0.9282,0.8802,7.1331,3.6724,3.256,4.0726,3.5169,3.6482,2.8492,5.4699,0.3736,0.1998,1.3021,4.5647,7.9232,5.1333,3.0755,0.6727,0.5446,0.938,1.7594,0.4595,6.6327,3.538,5.0567,3.7226,6.4667,0.7483,2.3314,1.5162,0.1402,3.8397,10.841,1.864,4.4774,0.2274,2.2363,3.2011,3.1714,3.7396,1.12,2.0007,5.8722,0.4602,3.0945,0.8582,4.1346,2.7646,0.5761,2.0975,0.7635,7.9227,0.4913,8.3601,5.4731,7.3566,5.9355,5.0831,5.0987,7.315,2.0888,4.4902,3.1623,0.8234,6.4358,0.9702,7.0714,5.3952,5.7392,4.3158,5.849,1.8799,1.9679,3.6472,6.6161,7.5879,1.9552,2.3681,0.6578,0.0738,1.3361,3.2638,6.1129,0.6893,4.0256,10.4658,0.4562,1.8359,2.4837,1.1217,3.3443,3.8237,4.0021,1.4697,0.2297,4.6921,1.7365,6.4771,1.2435,0.7905,1.2347,2.4102,1.0452,6.7196,3.4959,1.3959,0.0136,3.1032,0.811,0.6582,0.4796,1.7485,5.3888,9.7462,5.8308,2.3683,4.6805,1.8974,2.7704,0.4494,0.3666,1.1297,3.6242,3.5594,3.5323,3.6872,1.8414,3.4824,4.8604,1.1438,0.6218,2.9253,3.7768,4.2762,0.0514,2.7209,1.7602,3.8606,0.1935,2.0957,1.6926,2.5461,7.2577,1.0515,1.6772,3.4553,5.67,1.3662,0.4252,4.4257,2.3979,4.7366,8.585,0.0534,1.9313,0.9663,0.0021,1.4947,1.8071,0.8874,2.6724,1.5441,6.9748,0.2833,1.3354,0.8868,3.9298,3.1592,0.4868,0.142,1.5615,5.6794,2.8186,0.6628,5.9167,1.6201,3.9454,6.4444,5.2811,0.4513,3.5759,7.5526,1.897,2.1037,4.8317,1.4968,1.4044,4.9773,2.7173,0.3561,3.3172,5.5855,4.9075,0.0106,0.4804,0.8307,1.288,2.9371,4.8441,6.5225,2.883,0.7903,2.1613,5.6444,2.1193,0.3467,0.0929,3.1414,2.7389,5.706,0.0471,1.807,4.6624,3.3147,1.6863,2.8147,1.4966,1.0476,2.1119,2.6421,2.1737,3.7276,0.7074,4.6193,4.5197,4.4895,1.2917,2.3604,3.3631,2.4342,1.0502,2.8154,1.3396,1.2842,0.3228,2.4277,3.4359,3.0393,1.8219,3.4648,0.1377,1.3578,2.5072,7.583,0.0285,6.3173,2.89,4.9116,4.9111,1.3867,0.0001,1.7902,0.0815,1.5383,1.461,1.7931,4.2186,4.026,0.3315,6.3874,0.1691,1.6181,0.9503,2.0101,1.8546,5.977,0.3133,0.3378,5.0533,2.5356,5.4649,0.5545,3.4234,2.5999,5.3528,3.2907,0.2558,3.3488,0.4615,0.0071,0.527,2.4103,5.4759,0.262,2.4803,2.5455,3.8743,3.2812,0.0576,0.6984,4.0504,3.0548,5.0453,1.5548,3.402,1.6771,0.467,0.0554,4.0653,0.6045,1.5852,1.3342,2.3368,0.6783,1.2027,0.0001,0.3758,0.4403,2.6441,2.2532,2.0821,6.0436,2.1419,2.4978,0.026,7.8267,0.2566,2.388,2.4125,5.7317,0.6042,0.6999,1.1415,4.8988,2.9578,0.6372,5.5355,0.5718,4.1039,1.8464,0.8493,3.4432,1.7153,0.964,3.4684,1.4665,4.3349,5.2119,2.9682,3.2898,7.8398,6.1148,1.0143,0.2864,2.5851,1.7082,6.4819,2.1645,3.4321,5.2596,3.9565,0.6536,0.4969,2.8856,0.6107,4.6341,0.699,4.3343,3.9034,2.1997,4.3196,6.0212,0.8965,3.0548,5.8186,3.8506,3.8142,6.3908,0.0616,2.6771,0.5564,0.0782,5.3488,0.3045,0.0065,0.3519,3.8976,1.9023,3.3335,4.86,4.6949,3.2188,5.0295,3.313,3.523,1.6248,5.2746,1.8713,3.3306,2.964,2.2812,1.2966,1.6064,2.8911,3.4201,2.5593,5.8492,0.3075,3.3779,7.1674,2.1034,1.5296,2.2249,4.2782,3.5517,3.0074,2.3766,0.3076,6.1452,1.1567,1.8033,6.7833,0.2466,1.3218,0.2493,2.9802,4.3751,0.5222,4.1598,3.4588,3.5821,1.1874,3.5262,0.6546,1.2967,3.8938,1.3607,0.8993,3.4582,2.3765,1.8201,2.4264,0.1058,0.604,1.7378,1.6361,4.0319,1.1592,3.6255,4.8389,2.2292,0.3188,0.5803,1.8968,0.4455,2.2374,1.8633,1.6753,0.6208,1.5728,3.3855,4.7157,1.9293,4.6712,0.6608,4.8048,0.8524,3.9397,6.4945,0.3542,0.2578,3.9247,1.2294,0.4343,2.0204,1.0761,6.0066,0.0413,2.3774,0.1627,3.0668,1.3425,4.5638,3.085,5.6739,0.3842,6.0938,2.6774,6.1751,0.1075,3.7244,0.4964,5.7053,0.0086,0.0022,0.0186,1.4943,1.1963,4.0664,1.4792,1.4286,4.2359,2.502,2.1596,2.0163,2.0739,0.3915,1.6251,1.677,4.6803,0.805,6.0018,7.664,5.3234,0.8936,1.047,1.2914,3.1825,1.4476,1.9563,4.5923,5.6582,3.6894,1.1268,2.3837,7.9673,0.8995,3.8423,1.0523,1.2557,0.4168,3.5592,2.8647,3.0393,0.8192,0.963,4.7037,3.7642,2.6444,7.6566,0.0898,4.3121,1.7031,0.6084,3.489,2.6002,5.2894,0.0026,1.7155,0.8318,1.1023,0.5238,2.0984,3.0502,0.3146,0.1724,2.8147,0.6522,1.1616,4.5019,0.2219,3.4195,4.4105,2.4495,0.8954,2.908,0.7346,1.5801,0.8209,3.9652,0.944,0.9294,0.2749,0.185,4.1272,0.4025,0.1554,4.562,2.0251,3.6418,4.4374,0.4371,7.7286,0.2467,0.3453,1.0922,4.5723,6.7989,3.7503,0.4712,3.4919,0.8838,1.4704,2.3637,2.3685,6.437,2.6409,0.9994,3.0629,2.5576,3.8486,1.2285,2.6981,1.3502,0.0261,3.6205,1.7388,2.024,3.8912,2.0984,1.6717,1.0863,5.0606,5.8322,2.9531,2.2492,3.9728,1.6168,4.636,3.3652,0.7986,1.7948,2.1272,6.167,1.9748,5.6462,3.6235,0.4292,2.9099,1.4866,0.764,5.3937,2.9552,3.1106,1.4999,5.3199,3.4969,1.9224,4.0302,0.1885,1.6713,0.198

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump will announce his decision next week on whether to put North Korea on a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism , the White House said on Thursday . \u201c I believe","text":"President Donald Trump will announce his decision next week on whether to put North Korea on a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, the White House said on Thursday. \u201c I believe the U.S. decision should be made in consultation with other governments as the best course for international relations,\u201d Trump said during a televised State of the Union address. The move comes after the Trump administration began to look for a diplomatic solution to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, but its current economic sanctions and isolation are not making an impact. Trump told reporters Thursday that North Korea has \u201cclearly taken a wrong turn\u201d and that he has made it a top priority to find a solution. \u201cThese sanctions have not brought down one brick, one brick, of their nuclear program,\u201d Trump said in a speech that was expected to conclude a series of attacks against North Korea. His office, however, has largely declined to comment on a recent report by the Wall Street Journal that claimed Trump asked a senior administration official whether to put North Korea on the list of state sponsors of terrorism and whether the administration has been considering putting the country on the list. The move would place the North on the same level as the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. \u201cWhat I think we should do is put it on their [terrorist] list to punish them,\u201d Trump said. The State Department was scheduled to announce a U.S. embargo on imports of refined oil from Iran late Thursday, a policy that would be likely to affect a major source of crude oil for most of the Middle East. North Korea is said to be on the verge of developing a hydrogen bomb after developing hydrogen bombs between 2005 and 2012, a development seen by experts as vital for North American and Asian foreign policies. Asked how he would respond if the Chinese President Xi Xinping visited the United States, Trump said, \u201dYou bet. If he comes, I am going to talk about our relationship.\u201d China also has diplomatic ties with North Korea, and has previously tried to broker a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. The Chinese foreign ministry called North Korea\u2019s actions a \u201cserious provocation,\u201d adding the country was facing a \u201ccrisis\u201d that was threatening people\u2019s livelihood.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s actions will not only cause great suffering for the people there, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday, but also threaten international peace and security and economic cooperation.\u201d Last week, Trump threatened to \u201cturn up the heat\u201d on North Korea and threatened to \u201cdo something quite drastic, I believe, that will be very important.\u201d North Korea threatened to withdraw from the \u201cstrategic stability pact\u201d with the United States and Japan and called on Washington to stop its nuclear missile development. During a joint news conference with Trump later Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said North Korea had not responded yet to the U.S. offer to talk, a move that has not been accepted by the Tokyo government. Trump said that North Korea\u2019s nuclear-related activities had increased \u201cthousands of times over\u201d during his term, noting that the nuclear weapons program could easily be completed in six to 12 months despite Trump\u2019s sanctions. North Korea has said it could begin testing a hydrogen bomb in as little as six months, and it is believed that a weapons-usable nuclear device can be made within five years. Trump has also reiterated his threat of \u201ctaking very severe action against North Korea\u201d if the U.S. are unable to persuade Pyongyang to agree on

{"prompt":"NATO should defend Sweden and Finland in the event of an armed aggression , although neither country is an alliance member , a senior NATO official said on Wednesday at an event that underscored growing","text":"NATO should defend Sweden and Finland in the event of an armed aggression, although neither country is an alliance member, a senior NATO official said on Wednesday at an event that underscored growing tensions in the Baltic region. NATO also has its share of security issues that could potentially become threats to NATO, including the growing importance of the Gulf of Bothnia in Russia\u2019s east coast, the official said. Asked to name a single foreign challenge that could threaten NATO\u2019s security in the future, the official said it was unclear how the region could change because the Baltic Sea was too small, the same person said. \u201d We\u2019ve seen some recent conflicts involving North Korea, tensions in the Middle East, tensions with North Korea, tensions \u2026 so I don\u2019t see a significant threat to our security. \u201c\nThe Swedish ambassador to Moscow, Katarina Soderberg, told Swedish broadcaster SVT on Monday that a new Finnish nuclear missile defense system, including the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 system and new Iskander armaments, would pose a threat to NATO. \u201d The fact that the Finnish military is getting closer to Russia would mean that the possibility of a new Russian armament within the borders of Western NATO would increase, \u201d Soderberg said.\nHe said that if a new system for tracking the Russians\u2019 ballistic missiles had not been installed on the Finnish border with Russia, then the Patriot Advanced Capability defense system, together with the newly acquired Iskander missile systems, \u201d have a limited strategic use in a crisis, \u201d the ambassador said.\u201d\nAlthough it was established to defend against ground-to-air rocket attacks, the New START agreement limits the number of deployed strategic strategic arsenals in the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom. However, the New START treaty has recently been amended to expand the duration of the agreement to five years from its original period of five years.\nThe first stage of the agreement covers New START\u2019s two major components, nuclear weapons and warheads in nuclear-capable bombers, ballistic missiles and submarines. In response, the United States and Russia are expected to submit their reports under the new agreement on the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons and deliveries between November 4 and December 11. The second part of the agreement was agreed to between the United States and Russia in 2010 and concluded in early 2017. The two countries were also expected to submit their reports on new strategic arms between November 17 and December 15.\nLast week, the Pentagon announced plans to deploy a missile defense system in Finland, the Swedish ambassador said last week that a new Finnish nuclear missile defense system would mean threats from Russia. This is noteworthy in the current context of heightened tension between Moscow and Kiev over eastern Ukraine. \u201d In the case of the Patriot system and the Iskander systems, the situation is not very clear. It may mean that the Russian army is also close to [the Finnish border], \u201d the ambassador said, according to Swedish news portal Expressen.\nIt is unclear whether Sweden is considering deploying a ground-based defense system in the middle of the Gulf of Bothnia, and it is not known how these missiles will be used. The latest round of US-Russia negotiations over strategic arms control have led to an agreement on the number of strategic weapons under New START within five years, but the United States and Russia

The bill seeks to update laws around data sharing that have long outstripped technological advances.\nTwitter said in a blog post that the company has long complied with the rules about direct mail in election campaigns, and is using the platform for campaigns that promote ideas, not the election results. The changes, it said, are part of an effort to ensure that election accounts are properly identified as part of the ongoing election process.\nTwitter is also sharing with the public a timeline with the words \u201celection 2020\u201d, alongside election-related hashtags, it said on Tuesday. The Twitter election timeline is updated about six times a day, including on the day of the election itself and on Sundays.\nThe new changes are a response to a recent letter from the House Permanent Committee on Elections, where an influential Democrat said Twitter and others sharing electronic information with political parties risk violating a law banning \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d campaigning.\nTwitter said it was not clear at that time why the committee was targeting the company specifically, nor is it aware of a formal request from Congress.\nWe continue to follow the guidelines from the US Congress and U.S. state and local election officials. This includes ensuring political advertisers have a US address in a registered state, limiting the volume of ads from political campaigns, and taking additional action if there are any issues that remain unresolved.\nThe latest effort on Twitter\u2019s part will make it difficult for political parties to directly push political propaganda using the platform, and it comes after the US House of Representatives and the US Senate both voted for a new ban on direct deposit of election-related data to third parties.\nIn the letter, the committee, led by senior House member Nancy Pelosi, wrote that, in order to meet the letter\u2019s criteria at the Federal Election Commission, Facebook and other social media platforms would need \u201cto take significant steps to increase transparency, protect privacy, and prevent misuse of information they already collect\u201d at their platforms.\nThe legislation would prohibit banks from directing individuals to direct deposit information they receive from commercial providers or banks. But the law currently requires a consumer to click a \u201cforgot password\u201d button for direct deposit information.\nIn September, House member Jamie Raskin, who also led the letter to Facebook, said that the platform had used \u201ccredential hijacking\u201d to target millions of Facebook accounts of Americans. The social network said in October it was working to address \u201ccredential theft and the potential exploitation of our API\u201d and would update its privacy policy.\nSen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the banking committee, said in a statement on Sunday that the bill would \u201censure American voters receive clear and secure information to make a decision from

{"prompt":"A former government official criticized for being the principal author of the legal justifications for \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday as the top lawyer for the U.S.","text":"A former government official criticized for being the principal author of the legal justifications for \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday as the top lawyer for the U.S. prosecutors handling the cases of the men accused of masterminding the September 11 attacks.\nMeyer\u2019s confirmation by the U.S. Senate on Tuesday came after a five-hour filibuster that left one Republican senator, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, unable to express a vote because he had received a medical disqualification.\nThe House of Representatives approved him earlier in the week. After he was confirmed in the Senate Tuesday, he thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several of his fellow Republicans for supporting his confirmation despite their opposition to the administration\u2019s controversial interrogation techniques.\nHe also expressed confidence about the future of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d and defended them as reasonable ways of getting detainees to tell their side of the story.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the right question for a right person,\u201d Meyer told lawmakers after his Senate confirmation speech, according to reports on the Senate floor.\nMeyer previously served as an aide to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is President Donald Trump\u2019s most outspoken critic on the national security front at a time when the Pentagon\u2019s controversial \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d are being investigated as the root cause of death for several prison inmate deaths.\nEarlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amendment by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., aimed at reining in the practice of so-called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d or EITs. Lawmakers had previously supported the practice, so McCaskill\u2019s proposed substitute amendment would bar the CIA\u2019s use of techniques in the future only if it can be proven that a suspect has committed an especially heinous crime.\nMeyer argued in his confirmation speech that the new amendment should not be viewed as an endorsement of the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d He said he had no problem with them on principle, just as he had no problem with them when he served as a Senate aide to Lindsey Graham\u2019s then-Republican predecessor, John McCain, R-Ariz.\nMcCaskill is among several Republicans who support tighter restrictions on so-called EITs that have been widely criticized for causing grievous bodily harm. They have faced criticism from fellow Republicans such as Senate President John Cornyn and GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, who has criticized the president for his statements about CIA rendition and torture.\nMcCaskill was also an early proponent of a bill that was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday which would bar the CIA from interrogating anyone suspected of a serious crime unless they have a specific reason to believe they are trying to commit a crime or cooperate in an investigation.\n\u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t take away our right to interrogate people who pose a great threat to national security; it\u2019s a check against dangerous abuses,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut we must be careful not to conflate the use of torture or the misuse of legal procedures to extract information with the underlying policies of criminal prosecution.\u201d\nDemocrats have also supported efforts to curb the expansion of the CIA\u2019s use of EITs and to rein in their scope of use. In a report released last February, the National Commission Against Torture said the CIA should only use them when there is a good possibility that the suspect will act in the future in a way that poses a risk to national security.","token_len":741,"entropy":[7.9648,5.8962,0.822,9.0757,5.1863,3.978,4.7468,6.3259,3.0729,0.0912,0.6731,6.7956,10.2623,0.0318,0.3109,13.8977,7.1894,13.9136,0.9865,1.005,4.669,5.622,4.7632,9.6945,6.5468,1.0448,0.8996,0.7977,2.3485,1.9813,3.2749,1.772,3.3593,3.5986,0.967,0.935,3.6319,0.0009,0.0039,0.0425,10.0045,5.6666,0.5186,3.7196,2.5083,2.2552,4.4381,2.2028,0.1539,7.4141,0.0164,0.0,0.4872,2.4475,0.048,1.076,0.3412,0.2709,17.5488,4.8651,0.2392,7.2219,7.4712,4.2058,3.9379,4.0067,0.3927,4.0222,0.001,0.0035,0.01,0.3321,2.4061,0.3924,3.6879,1.54,1.7798,4.8837,0.0375,2.3641,3.11,2.1493,3.9262,4.4522,1.4534,1.6826,2.244,5.1591,1.9975,2.0173,0.0191,0.053,1.929,0.0196,6.4605,1.9307,1.4791,5.0333,0.9615,1.9393,5.6228,1.7223,7.1728,7.8009,0.0082,2.0223,0.4738,1.9077,5.0192,1.9909,0.0155,3.2157,4.9256,4.8792,2.2188,0.0599,2.3518,1.7386,6.0578,3.4999,1.2421,0.7323,3.4877,1.4889,0.4971,4.5917,0.3299,2.13,5.789,2.4189,0.8105,0.0387,0.3922,0.0015,2.1914,6.1185,2.8266,0.1875,2.2857,0.4635,0.5376,3.4993,1.1522,1.3174,5.8874,2.8724,1.1408,0.9167,1.3585,4.5202,6.5651,4.5776,0.3199,2.9741,1.5466,0.5276,0.3322,0.1607,3.8811,1.5411,3.4573,3.1917,4.8154,0.8323,3.678,0.0932,5.9234,0.1846,2.3126,0.0003,0.0197,0.325,1.0834,0.4441,1.7911,5.2731,2.0926,1.9004,6.4093,6.8323,2.3423,4.3174,3.0836,0.6782,5.8612,1.1046,4.4713,0.1055,0.0463,0.0285,0.5237,0.2121,1.7883,1.6033,6.7886,6.9708,1.8427,2.2158,3.4959,3.0004,7.6577,2.5775,3.2969,6.2359,4.2411,2.4872,2.6103,4.153,4.1874,2.7914,3.9992,3.6456,1.861,3.8945,0.1668,3.9126,2.7794,4.9592,0.0023,4.4374,3.6827,1.5339,1.1916,0.3808,0.1934,0.4231,3.4939,0.0009,0.0005,6.7944,1.5417,0.197,2.0767,3.5364,0.147,2.1194,0.004,3.6695,0.0197,1.8819,0.5107,0.0142,0.0558,0.0004,0.0009,0.0932,1.3905,3.1825,7.0081,1.0119,0.0203,5.3068,0.2521,0.0073,5.7296,4.4831,0.2294,2.3073,0.9411,5.9328,0.0315,3.169,6.181,2.0818,0.5572,0.1394,1.2755,5.7845,8.1462,0.1631,0.0044,2.9366,8.4802,0.3535,0.0404,0.0027,0.0265,0.3148,4.2055,0.0302,1.2527,1.9831,2.9411,3.1482,4.2918,7.3486,0.336,0.052,6.5482,2.8464,3.6881,11.4068,5.9586,1.4527,0.4913,0.288,5.7943,1.0122,0.7188,0.0683,2.2147,1.9939,1.4855,0.0372,2.1981,3.0076,0.7339,3.5909,0.7793,0.002,5.6288,0.0002,0.0,0.0001,0.5127,0.0334,0.0061,0.0047,0.0257,6.4538,0.02,5.0419,1.6962,0.0118,0.477,3.3067,0.6355,6.5266,0.0066,0.0007,4.1146,0.1613,0.0105,0.0039,0.0513,0.2095,2.1174,5.4373,1.7209,5.9185,4.1607,0.314,0.9064,0.6843,7.4314,0.0927,3.4328,2.2054,4.5668,1.5242,2.4202,1.6993,6.4789,3.1105,0.0003,0.002,4.0663,0.0082,0.0429,5.4174,9.4325,1.9609,6.2981,5.3893,1.4843,4.6982,4.6455,0.0265,0.0108,0.4509,0.1436,5.7878,3.4991,1.9708,3.6408,7.1192,0.6009,2.1769,3.9064,0.9315,1.2483,0.4284,3.4287,4.226,2.3604,2.1352,2.3466,8.0528,0.5123,0.4165,0.5261,0.2585,3.4165,0.001,0.0004,5.201,2.2963,0.7757,1.1034,0.5241,0.1108,1.5181,4.3247,1.3252,3.7753,1.8858,1.0074,3.3053,0.134,1.8477,2.9739,0.1561,1.3958,7.1572,0.0656,0.0085,0.0061,0.0771,0.3112,1.2319,6.2811,3.7221,1.9646,1.3331,2.5524,2.8909,2.9789,2.4103,0.2955,5.1606,5.1509,3.8931,0.6212,5.7794,2.3728,1.0127,1.0051,1.1021,0.1336,0.1497,2.6604,2.183,0.7395,2.2407,0.3177,0.8743,4.9682,1.5646,1.5707,5.1434,0.0046,2.2598,0.0025,0.0899,5.1649,0.0659,3.9856,3.2347,1.2054,2.253,0.0664,2.3815,7.93,0.0254,0.0046,0.0004,0.3986,0.479,4.1125,3.4416,0.0012,4.7992,4.8723,2.3782,1.5146,0.5837,4.0021,7.2942,1.5299,0.046,5.632,0.0063,0.0014,2.2028,0.0035,0.2291,3.3576,2.251,0.6345,3.6854,0.8329,1.7312,3.9732,7.5469,0.0102,1.9966,0.1744,2.3165,4.5414,2.6098,5.2658,1.9737,1.236,5.1408,0.5566,2.7753,0.0023,4.0069,5.563,1.9682,1.9247,0.0,2.7255,5.0604,2.1907,2.5052,3.7351,0.0026,1.2102,0.5009,2.6365,2.9554,0.9053,6.1383,0.7133,2.8043,5.9549,1.4219,7.0927,5.6025,2.5258,0.9887,0.8484,0.3167,3.4755,0.2593,0.0019,3.7795,2.031,3.6066,2.5249,2.1684,0.0521,2.5552,2.4883,1.256,4.5223,3.5259,0.6784,0.3101,1.1162,1.2787,0.0281,2.409,3.1982,4.9938,0.2344,2.4782,0.9122,0.8289,0.2693,4.4069,0.005,3.423,2.0824,0.0238,2.041,3.747,0.4642,4.1407,0.9461,1.4196,2.2785,4.4156,2.4844,1.1472,1.0727,1.0997,0.9363,5.567,0.0053,1.2564,0.5786,1.2539,3.3774,8.0127,1.5504,2.4383,0.4939,0.3494,0.5316,1.7469,0.3523,3.9583,3.0804,4.9839,1.283,0.9178,0.007,5.1721,1.2018,4.2657,1.6332,0.0825,5.3967,0.0014,2.6217,2.3756,4.4497,0.3756,5.7671,1.1868,0.3105,1.823,0.0062,5.1525,0.6136,3.4172,0.0424,0.0098,1.8421,6.2914,3.5866,7.0068,5.6051,3.3208,0.5814,2.2054,0.4769,0.65,0.5161,5.022,0.1025,3.1044,2.6501,3.4314,2.9575,2.1548,1.7155,0.0065,6.3859,0.037,2.0373,3.0014,0.0156,2.0257,3.6847,2.7142,5.1088,0.0174,6.5993,2.3516,2.7866,6.8193,1.1924,2.9562,1.03,7.4518,6.0091,0.9358,5.2536,3.3526,1.2515,1.4043,1.9989,0.3346,6.1495,1.6354,2.3456,5.7506,4.9026,0.4248,5.1654,1.1281,7.5769,0.0375,2.0563,3.2722,5.454,0.008,0.0287,1.1581,0.0283,0.5609,0.0017,0.1017,2.5428,3.0437,4.3887,0.3878,2.8448,7.1407,1.0869,1.0261,0.5992,3.0236,1.9572,4.7947,1.1905,1.6488,5.4666,0.1659,0.6527,2.766,2.3832,3.6905,0.0669,0.0009,2.6363,1.834,1.6838,3.7258,4.5339,0.8488,5.2544,2.4488,2.7113,0.3106,1.1686,4.5162,6

{"prompt":"The Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing adjustments in arms for U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria but stopped short of declaring a halt to weapons transfers , suggesting such decisions would be based on","text":"The Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing adjustments in arms for U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria but stopped short of declaring a halt to weapons transfers, suggesting such decisions would be based on the security situation in the northeast.\nSyria is at war with al-Qaida-linked groups, including the Islamic State, Syrian rebels and the Kurdish fighters.\nThe U.S. had also said last week it might stop arms deliveries to Kurdish forces in northern Syria, citing a deteriorating security situation.\nThe announcement on Monday came a day after news broke that U.S. military commanders had ordered fighter jets to fly into Syria in order to strike Islamic State targets in Syria. The White House and Pentagon both said Tuesday that a number of planes flew over the area, but declined to say whether the flights were targeted by U.S. missiles.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has been talking to his allies about the potential option to suspend arms deliveries to the Kurdish YPG, which has conducted attacks on Islamic State targets in Syria.\nThe Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) announcement last week that it is investigating the Apple Store\u2019s collection and storage of user content appears to have focused attention on the Apple TV, but it\u2019s worth remembering that the iPhone does the same thing right now.\nThe iPhone has been subject to a series of privacy probes over the last few months, including recently an investigation by a New York state judge into whether Apple violated laws by disclosing locations of users through the \u201cFind My\u201d service.\nOn Wednesday, the FTC announced that it was launching a new investigation into practices used by the Apple Store.\nThe new rules focus on how Apple handles requests made by users to remove content from the store, including when an item has been \u201crepurposed.\u201d The FTC also says it will investigate the content of online apps downloaded to the Apple Store as well as how these apps can interact with user data.\nThe FTC\u2019s announcement, via a blog post, comes as some consumers continue to believe that Apple will be making unannounced changes to privacy and safety procedures after a July 7, 2013 lawsuit was filed in San Jose, California.\nThe suit was filed by Californian consumer advocate David Matas that describes policies by Apple as overpowering and unfair. Matas, who claims a legal right to the content he shared with friends, says Apple has been violating his rights by not notifying him when other Apple users take his photos or videos.\nApple says its policies require companies seeking access to Apple TV content to sign a contract requiring them to abide by Apple\u2019s rules on privacy and security. The company\u2019s policies allow store staff to use a list of devices and people linked to content provided to them and allow the store staff to remove, suspend, or disable content provided by another user for their devices or apps.\nApple has consistently denied the allegations that such policies violate users\u2019 privacy rights, but critics have noted that the company was sued once before, in 2011, by a group of activists for its similar policies.\nAs with the previous lawsuit, supporters of Apple believe that Apple\u2019s policies are well-balanced because they allow people to

{"prompt":"Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week , after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him","text":"Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him after his downfall seemed increasingly certain. The opposition, led by conservative leaders, said it would accept a new poll showing him with a slim majority - likely between 39-50 seats - to stop Kuczynski from winning a third term that would be the only way for him to become president by December. Kuczynski had already won in October on the strength of a resounding majority, with a run-off against centrist Keiko Fujimori, who has been in jail since last May on corruption charges. But that result was based on much lower turnout than usual, and there remained doubt whether it would be legally valid. The opposition was hoping to get some of Kuczynski's detractors to sign a petition urging an additional ballot. At a party meeting on Wednesday night, some six seats to the left of the centrist centre, the opposition said some lawmakers had broken ranks with their party leaders to support the former defence minister. The movement has not yet clarified how, if at all, it would make up those seats. Several other right-wing lawmakers, who had also been sceptical about supporting Kuczynski under the circumstances, said they had supported the opposition's initiative. While supporting a new election was an indication of the dissatisfaction of many in the party with Kucshnki's government, it does not necessarily represent a new political camp and no one knows if they would ever support another centre-left government. \"The party has given a clear support to move forward to try to ensure the right of the voters to have an election and have the results taken away from Mr Kuczynski,\" Congress Speaker Manuel Merino, a general of the military, told Reuters. \"It will be possible to convince the judges with legal means in our country as well as in the European courts. \" Lawyer Hector Becchi, who has criticised Kuczynski, said in a news conference yesterday that Kuczynski was right to ask fresh voting after the Constitutional Court on Wednesday threw out a case aimed at getting him ousted from office on grounds of high presidential corruption. \"The only fact that can be said with certainty is that the election will not be performed,\" Becchi, a former lawmaker and head of a new coalition party, Alianza for the Future, was quoted as saying. With Kuczynski unlikely to win an election, his approval ratings - around 40 per cent - remain the lowest in months. On the same day, the government's coalition partners - Peruvian centre-left party Frente Amplio and regional left-leaning group Podemos - formally backed the proposal to call a new election. The party's leaders said they will take advantage of this opportunity to forge a new government with other left-wing parties and support the idea that Kuczynski resign. \"It's a victory for the Peruvian people. No one is being forced to believe what they do not believe,\" said Sergio Tejada from Podemos. \"( Kuczynski) is not going to continue in office,\" he added. A legal opinion by the Supreme Court's Constitutional Division, which also disallowed Kuczynski's removal from office, said the elections could not be conducted if he regained office. If the judges follow this, the case would once again come before a Constitutional Court judge and, as happened three days ago, the judge would reject the claims. \"So what are we left with?\" Merino said. \"Then you have to go to elections.

{"prompt":"A Spanish court has ordered the imprisonment of a former El Salvadoran army colonel for participating in the murder of five Spanish Jesuits in 1989 during the Central American country s civil war , a","text":"A Spanish court has ordered the imprisonment of a former El Salvadoran army colonel for participating in the murder of five Spanish Jesuits in 1989 during the Central American country s civil war, a criminal court said Saturday.\nThe court sentenced General Francisco Milla to 26 years and seven months for his role in the murder in 1995, the first time an El Salvadoran military officer has been convicted in a tribunal involving foreigners.\nThe priests were killed in the capital San Salvador three weeks after they had fled El Salvador, fleeing the civil war, which lasted from 1981 to 1992. The murderers also shot at the victims in their vehicle.\nPresident Oscar Arias and his wife, the former Spanish First Lady Laura Chinchilla, received a delegation of El Salvadoran business leaders on Tuesday, one day after the signing of an investment pact that will see more than $5 billion in additional business investment in Costa Rica over the next 10 years; including the first manufacturing projects, tourism, electricity, telecommunication and telecommunications infrastructure investments in El Salvador since the end of civil war in 1989.\nThe El Salvador-Costa Rica Investment Agreement, signed in Costa Rica by President Oscar Arias and his counterpart Roberto d\u00b4Aubuisson, was aimed at increasing trade, investment and tourism in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El Salvador, and provides for joint activities in the areas of technical cooperation in civil aviation and maritime traffic.\nThe government has established a new strategy to help the millions who suffered in the worst years of this conflict, said the official who signed a document that is aimed at fighting poverty and promoting development in the region.\nThe El Salvador Investment Committee is composed of representatives from Costa Rica, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Honduras, said Vice President of Costa Rica Alejandro Arias of the government\u2019s National Planning Commission, who has been leading the initiative. This group is coordinated by the Government of El Salvador\u2019s Central American Investment Promotion Agency, and will be chaired by a government official and the Finance Minister of the Central American country.\nThe President of the Central American Investment Promotion Agency, Javier Trejos, said: It is our belief that the investment is very important for the Central Americans. The countries we are trying to promote are part of a strategic market to the global supply of capital, but in addition to that, we have the great opportunity to bring the Central American regions to a better way in terms of development, with an investment of 500 million dollars and an increase in economic activity, both in manufacturing and in tourism.\u201d\nA study developed by the United States Institute of Peace shows that the government of Nicaragua has been the biggest violator of human right in the Central American region, and this has contributed to the creation of a climate of insecurity and violence that has made it difficult to attract business to this country.\nThe study, released this week by the Institute for the Environment and Human Rights Center (ICLEI) and the Center for Economic Policy and Law (CEPL), the two non-governmental organizations behind this study, showed that the government of Nicaragua has violated rights to life, freedom, work and family.\nIt also indicated how the actions of the government have made it clear that there is a pattern of violation of human rights, mainly political and social, which is consistent with the administration\u2019s policies to improve its image, which have been based on the promotion of an economic and human rights policy.\nThe report shows that the state has been violent and has violated human rights. It also noted a pattern of violations similar to what the country did during its civil war, and showed the lack of respect for human rights in the country.","token_len":743,"entropy":[10.3175,4.3036,1.484,1.4772,1.1303,7.0918,0.056,1.8077,2.8796,7.8402,1.9564,0.111,5.1347,2.393,2.1532,7.2985,0.0073,1.5968,3.8166,0.0735,4.2811,5.0747,10.1824,0.0145,1.2108,4.7091,4.7521,1.4383,6.8248,0.0847,2.9837,11.3998,3.7776,0.0229,2.4627,2.7859,3.9932,1.8905,1.8049,4.0682,0.1386,0.2617,14.0056,1.9738,3.6527,5.2831,3.6963,4.5124,7.2333,3.6611,6.3427,0.2897,3.2615,3.0802,0.057,2.8368,2.3502,0.629,0.0209,0.3648,2.1277,4.3105,5.5324,2.1081,1.9518,3.3861,0.8895,2.6725,1.357,0.0019,0.0316,2.7693,1.8394,0.75,0.1287,2.1252,2.1951,1.5968,7.1357,4.7988,7.8972,0.3877,0.2137,2.4357,9.7813,1.2055,1.5904,1.1502,1.7511,4.9492,4.1369,0.4039,6.3941,1.971,0.4037,2.5074,2.5364,5.1376,3.5301,0.0058,2.5324,4.3936,1.6154,3.4466,0.015,2.8486,3.5767,4.0413,0.9674,3.9017,0.2442,2.2706,0.1557,2.6548,6.0323,4.1943,4.2081,2.6851,1.7053,4.009,2.1961,2.5595,6.797,1.8313,0.2209,4.4368,6.6478,8.8471,0.0218,4.0961,1.5686,1.7566,0.7103,4.2773,2.7195,4.3178,6.3971,0.062,4.9311,7.4694,4.7897,0.1579,0.2088,5.9026,1.2877,8.9171,0.9923,3.7369,0.0033,1.0987,8.2117,0.6216,3.2314,3.5974,2.3487,5.5929,1.5693,0.3051,0.759,9.0543,0.0866,2.549,7.4703,2.793,2.4921,2.0339,2.3662,5.024,0.1623,0.5136,3.4742,0.21,1.2464,6.5877,4.5058,2.224,1.4551,5.8575,0.0336,3.9309,0.3142,0.038,2.6548,0.0138,7.8802,5.8587,2.3345,5.5852,7.6652,5.8778,3.152,5.0719,1.3826,6.6215,1.1204,5.5652,0.1979,0.5391,2.3244,3.2353,4.6954,1.8271,3.2487,0.0026,4.0372,1.2739,3.7984,0.0017,5.9487,0.035,0.7011,2.4894,0.1138,0.1559,1.3587,4.3084,0.0264,4.5208,5.8911,0.0058,0.2273,2.3271,2.5833,1.5314,1.0901,0.6907,6.432,0.0044,3.0865,1.2848,4.3654,0.1436,0.0003,0.7486,1.3764,8.3987,7.1287,9.4947,8.1582,1.8349,5.9921,0.7568,0.0619,0.9165,1.9918,3.7368,0.0283,3.6604,3.8008,2.4653,0.9303,0.2652,2.2458,1.201,6.8294,1.0773,2.7836,0.0013,1.4271,2.672,0.5025,2.4277,0.0026,1.17,2.1394,7.8665,0.9898,5.2351,5.8875,2.1382,1.4033,3.6418,0.086,6.5302,1.8897,3.4515,4.9563,3.7413,1.3099,3.2388,5.1847,1.1665,0.3191,1.0137,4.0201,2.024,5.8539,0.8151,3.7932,7.0381,0.9774,3.4228,2.1355,8.2021,3.8417,5.6058,1.4673,0.3697,6.1804,3.5974,0.109,5.7336,0.9523,1.3204,4.2256,2.1559,3.7976,3.6119,6.9835,3.7787,2.6285,3.3724,3.3322,4.8317,0.0293,7.1556,3.807,0.8684,3.1295,2.6163,1.6051,0.7682,1.359,0.244,0.3136,1.1743,4.017,0.006,5.4012,6.5935,2.8263,4.1859,0.0546,2.0421,0.5631,4.506,0.0478,0.2222,3.2638,0.2629,3.187,0.0023,0.4674,1.669,0.474,4.0136,0.4826,3.4543,2.0973,1.2501,2.8561,8.6504,0.2826,3.4915,3.2559,0.2451,4.7577,0.0353,5.7398,0.0047,4.9633,0.5643,2.8807,14.3128,7.7498,3.9627,3.0839,6.7675,1.6381,1.414,1.6313,3.1677,1.3788,3.5004,0.3336,4.866,0.8439,6.3099,3.0774,1.8581,6.5656,0.4954,0.5664,4.7645,0.1415,2.1171,0.0114,2.6743,0.2123,0.0041,4.0915,3.1207,5.8153,5.6016,1.3597,1.1173,2.5093,3.4224,1.9575,3.2045,0.0212,3.4829,4.8116,1.7005,3.048,2.6885,6.519,0.5342,1.4558,1.7947,2.2749,0.1542,0.8703,0.8361,0.268,0.955,5.458,1.4296,1.6253,2.421,0.2033,4.9089,0.0443,0.049,0.5669,4.4815,7.7164,3.8401,3.8065,0.8684,1.6208,3.7074,8.0297,0.4244,3.6679,4.2412,0.0814,1.1855,3.9887,4.0876,4.5461,0.3585,1.277,0.9002,3.6555,3.2515,1.9911,2.1082,6.2964,4.0953,1.4737,4.6104,0.0414,2.4381,1.1411,6.1639,0.017,2.0394,4.4626,7.8282,3.5341,3.1089,5.6068,5.8715,1.9796,4.6941,1.782,4.1452,3.3599,4.0751,0.9755,1.1087,0.9373,1.2129,2.2312,3.159,5.8171,3.1969,0.4319,3.5644,2.7693,2.9022,1.0009,6.9142,2.4327,2.598,2.6425,6.0703,4.3049,2.9088,0.0011,3.1216,1.9797,4.8392,3.3824,2.4435,1.2603,5.9258,0.8927,1.54,3.7139,3.3248,2.9928,0.3468,3.5418,0.9652,2.2404,4.5896,0.8774,8.8094,0.1915,1.2837,1.4199,0.557,8.0406,8.8372,0.2769,3.9603,6.1455,8.52,0.3582,0.4354,3.6842,1.581,2.7371,0.2829,0.2247,5.6379,0.1983,1.5584,5.0723,1.9483,3.7097,1.6604,2.7854,2.9283,2.7438,6.5322,0.02,0.1796,2.5284,6.6492,2.9921,0.7687,2.6394,0.2187,0.6631,1.3548,2.0411,4.1302,2.5151,3.7092,0.1791,0.7121,5.5163,0.0414,1.2767,4.7569,0.54,3.3063,1.2488,2.8002,2.1212,0.7266,4.2302,1.139,0.9916,1.2406,4.9374,3.81,2.2158,4.0026,1.7755,0.4764,0.7748,1.2419,4.066,2.2488,3.2728,3.241,0.4069,1.5364,0.2123,2.2445,0.7816,2.7058,4.8797,0.6804,3.3234,0.0992,8.705,2.4678,9.2873,7.3886,2.4024,2.0793,0.6565,2.218,0.0413,3.2172,3.3046,1.9193,4.427,1.8086,0.9953,3.7675,0.5736,5.7516,2.3559,4.38,0.0273,0.4037,0.4107,5.5011,3.6419,1.5635,0.127,3.1276,0.1095,1.3228,1.9285,0.7,0.2056,0.9476,4.4568,4.6057,1.3986,2.2676,0.4872,2.7321,1.5586,5.9936,0.5584,4.6234,2.7153,0.7573,3.8223,1.7589,4.8583,4.5669,0.9933,6.8792,0.3809,0.4763,0.7986,2.1282,3.7829,1.0026,5.972,0.3263,3.8142,0.5935,1.3204,6.2392,0.1867,5.8414,0.3158,0.7595,0.0645,2.1686,7.0556,6.3495,1.3555,2.5113,1.3134,2.7689,1.915,5.0594,0.0295,0.652,5.782,5.7946,0.1866,0.0275,2.9816,3.0807,4.9133,3.6004,3.0978,2.5831,3.3392,2.4279,1.6247,3.9699,0.118,1.8115,4.9773,0.0419,4.499,2.6182,2.403,3.4336,0.1944,5.1588,0.7749,0.2882,1.0717,2.1663,3.8382,0.2562,0.8192,5.1265,1.8826,2.285,7.6847,1.3736,2.7602,3.3281,1.0044,0.0249,2.6649,2.0648,1.172,3.8622,4.3446,2.024,0.1315,2.7821,8.4331,0.0173,3.4065,

{"prompt":"Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defended his pardon for Alberto Fujimori on Monday as justified clemency for an ailing man whose authoritarian government in the 1990s helped the country progress , after Peruvians protested","text":"Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defended his pardon for Alberto Fujimori on Monday as justified clemency for an ailing man whose authoritarian government in the 1990s helped the country progress, after Peruvians protested outside his palace that the former president must also face charges for human rights abuses and war crimes.\nKuczynski, who spent two years in prison for embezzlement, said that Fujimori was pardoned for the same reason that most convicts in Peru are released with conditional sentences - to avoid another prison term that would interfere with his health condition.\nBut critics accuse Kuczynski of condoning the persecution of political opponents and human rights violators that took place at the time. Kuczynski denies these accusations, and Fujimori had been fighting his removal from power by legal means.\nKuczynski was impeached in December when a vote in Congress to remove him as head of state failed. Then, he issued a pardon that freed more than 6,000 prisoners, removed some restrictions on his presidential immunity and granted him the job of senator for life.\nKuczynski said he believed that the pardon did \"provoke profound disagreements\" while defending it as \"the appropriate solution for a political and legal man who, like him and his family, has suffered the worst that politics can do to a human.\"\nThe opposition and human rights activists said it was the right to pardon, but that they would continue to demand justice, accountability and reparations.\n\"There are two sides to the same coin,\" said Marisol Espinoza of the human rights committee in the National Congress. \"One is letting Fujimori go to his own house to die because he has failed in his condition, and the other is that those who have committed violations today deserve to be punished.\"\nIn recent days, however, human rights violations in Peru, especially against indigenous activists who have continued to protest for their political and economic rights, have received attention.\nFujimori's daughter said he had been suffering from brain swelling and was now in a coma, and he remained in grave condition.\nIn a statement, the Peruvian National Police (PNP) admitted, \"over the weekend during a meeting in his home with a number of friends, a medical diagnosis of brain swellings and delirium was made.\" It added, \"The President and people concerned, including family members, were immediately directed to seek care in a hospital,\" and that he received medical treatment in an ICU. Kuczynski was transferred Friday to Lima Hospital in a private vehicle.\nHuman rights activists said he had been under constant surveillance for the last two years, and they demanded that investigations be reopened and charges be brought against those responsible for the violence he has faced.\nKuczynski was removed as head of state in December after accusing Congress of trying to remove him to prevent him from facing crimes related to the murder of two young girls in Peru in 1992, when he served there as governor.\nIn an attempt to stave off a military coup, he was captured, tried by a judge without an opportunity to defend himself and convicted to 25 years in prison and a fiveyear-period of house confinement after he was blamed for the murders. The death penalty was later avoided due to his health condition. Fujimori served his time in a military jail before being released in 2011 after winning a judicial challenge to the conviction.\nLast month, he was hospitalized for kidney failure, whereupon many people asked Kuczynski to stop his campaign for re-election to preserve his health. However, he has not disclosed the nature of his illness or his hospital stay.","token_len":743,"entropy":[6.3133,7.076,12.4355,8.2528,1.6486,0.1806,0.0393,0.0308,9.3305,1.3545,6.9482,3.426,5.5788,1.9713,0.1559,0.0161,3.1561,2.0353,3.6333,8.2808,11.8409,0.0047,0.0008,1.773,4.2077,7.162,0.0907,3.4304,3.3975,10.476,3.6085,4.5169,1.7757,2.6936,0.0136,4.5855,4.5547,1.2281,9.7524,4.0672,4.9407,10.7195,4.3076,0.012,3.5702,4.504,1.0851,4.0162,4.0103,1.8582,3.2711,1.4029,6.4341,6.4654,2.9949,2.0805,2.0281,4.0682,0.0412,0.5148,3.2894,5.1445,0.009,0.3386,0.726,16.8957,0.0111,0.0025,1.7921,0.8755,5.4603,2.8972,0.7392,0.5528,0.5725,0.9207,5.5773,0.001,0.0001,0.247,1.2307,2.2462,2.1514,1.9128,0.0045,0.0006,1.8432,3.6135,0.02,2.3971,2.4752,2.9692,1.3787,1.9983,5.6595,6.7432,0.0012,2.8663,3.6663,2.1245,4.9811,5.2631,6.7104,1.7244,5.5996,2.1096,2.1249,6.532,2.8471,0.7651,4.1852,1.4534,7.3787,0.0277,0.9913,6.1419,5.26,0.2465,0.3454,3.3279,3.9583,4.0237,1.531,0.0014,0.0004,0.2119,7.1044,0.0063,1.974,4.3168,0.2612,2.8142,0.5146,1.6125,4.1867,0.0087,2.7325,0.0012,5.0373,4.2128,0.214,3.2679,0.7183,1.9532,1.5255,4.4048,0.005,0.0012,4.6286,2.6708,1.6289,1.4205,1.7052,5.8127,0.0024,0.0003,5.6316,1.4482,6.4817,3.5271,4.5536,0.5968,1.7799,4.7065,6.9089,0.6871,0.6046,0.3159,2.7114,0.0156,0.0019,3.6199,4.9388,0.0002,0.8103,3.4581,5.2342,2.517,4.7491,2.4548,3.0719,2.4811,2.0474,0.2763,5.2504,4.0069,0.0131,2.445,2.4596,1.2413,6.7078,1.0875,2.8479,6.2287,0.4649,2.2157,2.7849,5.0032,4.7693,0.0322,4.5698,0.2862,0.3029,2.3142,1.4032,8.3911,3.1978,7.2733,0.3711,2.3572,6.2565,5.4798,0.6949,3.9977,1.6671,2.4709,5.4073,0.1065,8.3653,2.2609,6.1516,0.2962,0.4921,2.0119,0.0064,0.002,2.4091,1.3835,4.4426,1.409,1.7825,1.7851,4.7437,4.5434,4.8594,3.074,8.3733,6.8929,1.1372,7.8544,5.5954,4.8131,2.2122,2.3105,2.3808,6.2502,5.2017,2.2795,2.5934,2.8277,3.1461,3.2391,8.218,0.9848,4.0434,2.802,5.358,4.4167,1.7747,1.8015,0.1834,1.7892,2.1398,3.4281,3.549,6.3001,6.0153,0.9954,2.9853,1.1645,4.1494,2.8943,5.5591,0.2165,2.3657,5.4575,4.4565,3.2813,0.031,2.8416,2.7537,3.1797,0.4639,3.085,3.2023,4.4474,3.0262,4.1295,1.6371,2.687,3.0461,3.069,3.2758,0.4701,3.2843,3.2163,3.5417,9.7114,0.1555,4.7802,0.2801,1.2786,0.4333,1.8964,3.6239,1.7724,3.5898,1.6503,0.229,2.1164,3.032,0.4248,0.999,0.3558,4.8057,3.9934,6.5524,1.6919,0.0409,3.3677,0.4996,3.9292,0.0147,7.0227,2.1596,2.169,3.7164,3.4557,1.3814,0.4742,3.6649,2.1169,9.3339,2.9803,0.0057,0.0007,0.9505,3.1854,4.1386,2.4087,3.4399,2.7131,3.3948,3.7978,0.8127,2.044,4.7328,2.9468,0.5074,9.8245,1.5624,0.8521,0.4261,0.042,0.1403,4.2641,5.7001,0.4213,2.1628,3.6847,4.7597,7.7477,2.9717,0.8989,0.6227,1.838,1.4951,0.2873,3.3434,4.2056,1.51,0.1201,5.247,0.0006,5.1589,0.0144,7.0913,2.1008,0.6106,3.3444,3.7078,3.1864,3.657,4.0605,3.2429,1.3809,6.064,0.287,2.6216,3.1492,4.0936,4.7852,2.5077,1.6456,0.1382,0.1841,0.1441,5.0991,4.313,1.3769,0.7107,3.3983,0.0415,0.0026,0.0006,1.7693,5.5717,3.6159,2.7369,1.3151,1.4003,6.3705,0.5736,4.831,5.4394,1.4603,3.0009,4.1344,1.6013,1.0576,0.5128,1.8064,1.6147,3.2073,5.8029,1.0968,7.8315,0.4622,1.6918,1.1221,2.9762,1.4342,0.9193,1.3329,1.9675,4.4451,0.0524,2.3864,2.6457,5.302,0.5458,0.1429,0.1076,7.4166,5.8555,0.5716,8.0201,0.4859,4.1198,7.0814,1.4994,3.0963,2.5935,3.4908,2.2172,4.7213,2.7339,2.8568,0.0016,5.039,0.4935,3.2245,6.1049,6.2065,0.9455,1.9899,7.7628,0.4944,2.2255,8.5271,0.0896,0.0349,1.6592,2.3825,1.4531,2.831,1.673,1.4326,0.1291,1.8376,5.2756,3.4291,7.7224,5.5996,3.56,2.1828,4.4109,0.5133,0.6859,2.629,4.9361,5.4884,0.1433,2.6182,5.4881,2.3317,2.0501,0.8798,5.4504,1.426,1.6079,2.7576,4.8458,2.8282,1.011,2.2735,3.6236,5.7092,0.0036,0.7487,7.4092,0.0156,0.001,2.4759,3.9028,7.6284,0.5934,5.0714,2.639,2.0095,2.775,3.449,3.4562,0.7757,0.3778,5.5627,0.6166,1.5371,1.4896,2.2691,1.0917,0.8118,4.1073,2.0057,2.0125,1.5277,2.6342,1.5811,1.7127,0.7857,0.9428,1.0764,3.2448,4.0612,0.9984,7.1882,0.4571,4.6193,2.514,4.5262,1.3413,0.9702,0.2252,3.5913,0.6478,0.9953,1.2952,4.6034,4.0783,1.7392,2.5105,0.5259,0.461,2.9298,0.0437,0.0018,3.1442,4.7284,2.6072,1.1525,0.0021,0.1181,1.1796,1.6606,1.2864,7.842,6.8109,0.3523,3.2452,0.0268,3.4973,0.1113,4.5672,2.7395,0.7999,0.2185,5.2597,7.8412,4.8134,0.0044,1.789,5.6201,0.0739,3.1156,4.6195,3.1008,0.9819,3.7799,1.3995,3.4592,2.3854,2.4237,0.5129,4.7252,8.5268,0.6042,2.8076,0.3476,1.1392,2.7598,2.6396,4.6632,0.0226,5.0219,0.7656,0.0025,2.2403,5.1492,0.6442,1.0767,2.4127,1.8484,6.9998,3.5941,4.1833,3.5941,2.019,4.6707,6.288,5.4778,4.5745,0.281,3.3169,0.0441,1.555,4.7284,5.8885,6.5051,0.0255,0.1661,0.0655,3.4133,1.5937,6.2303,11.2428,6.7529,8.0346,0.2171,2.0574,10.1207,4.3445,1.8946,0.8209,8.641,0.0882,1.1368,3.0154,0.7364,2.9428,5.0027,0.7726,0.7547,1.7741,9.7365,4.8634,0.0031,3.5115,5.038,1.5776,0.5063,4.0903,0.0015,0.0005,5.0554,3.4898,1.7661,0.467,2.3577,1.8841,2.3002,2.684,0.3632,1.2058,1.5643,3.5501,2.6789,6.1031,1.382,4.9356,4.7242,0.976,1.2362,2.5935,0.4822,0.4918,5.2228,1.1551,0.123,2.6063,0.6274,5.9612,1.7502,6.5873,0.3861,1.6323,4.9242,6.8745,7.1529,3.1826,5.3575,5.7275,0.0055,0.0012,0.998,3.2088,2.747,3.5354,1.8261,1.506,0.023

{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Republicans are unveiling a tax proposal that differs markedly on corporate , business and individual tax cuts from legislation unveiled by their counterparts in the House of Representatives , Republican aides said on","text":"U.S. Senate Republicans are unveiling a tax proposal that differs markedly on corporate, business and individual tax cuts from legislation unveiled by their counterparts in the House of Representatives, Republican aides said on Thursday.\nThe difference is likely to spur an effort by lawmakers to reconcile the differences, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressing interest in taking on a bipartisan task force to resolve the differing tax propositions.\nSenate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is considering scheduling a hearing for members of various task forces to address the differing corporate tax proposals for the debate.\nThe tax proposal unveiled Thursday by House Republicans - $48 billion worth - would eliminate tax breaks to corporations and businesses, cut the corporate minimum tax rate by 15 percentage points and cut the individual top tax rate by 35 percent for households with incomes over $250,000.\n\"Republican proposals eliminate all of the gains made by workers during the last decade and cut the maximum individual tax rate by 25 percent for those who currently collect $500,000,\" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), a Senate budget committee member, called the plan in a statement.\nHouse Republicans also want to abolish the estate tax, which has not been implemented since 1913.\nHatch, Coburn and Republican budget committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) were among those to criticize the corporate tax proposals in the Senate proposal.\n\u201cThere is no compelling reason why we should have different tax policies between the two houses of Congress,\u201d said Levin, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cWe cannot afford to have different tax policies.\u201d\nBoth the House and Senate proposals would also eliminate the estate tax and double the corporate tax rate for large U.S. corporations.\nThe Senate plan would not include any business or individual tax provisions and would instead expand health insurance programs.\nThe Senate proposal said it would raise the top marginal individual rate to 35 percent from the current 26.6 percent, and would double the corporate tax rate for those companies making more than 150 million dollars in profits each year to 27 percent.\nThe House bill would reduce the individual top marginal rate from 35 percent to 35 percent and keep the corporate rate, currently 27 percent, unchanged. The Senate bill would cut the top individual rate from 39 percent to 35 percent and keep the corporate rate unchanged.\nBoth proposals would impose a 35 percent payroll tax on companies with fewer than 50 employees with no limits on the amount that can be taxed.\nSen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chief of the Senate's powerful Finance Committee, said he was confident that lawmakers will find a way to address the differences.\n\u201cSenate leadership is working to build consensus for bipartisan action,\" he said in a statement. \"The tax discussion is not over.\u201d\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Okla.) said the House tax bill would increase the individual tax rate by 4 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, and would increase the corporate tax rate from 27 percent to 28 percent.\n\u201cOur proposal would make American families and businesses even richer, with hundreds of billions of dollars in additional tax revenue available for the American people,\u201d said Boehner, in a statement.\nHouse Republicans also include their healthcare

Brownback , who previously served in both","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump intends to nominate Republican Kansas Governor Sam Brownback as ambassador at large for international religious freedom, the White House said on Wednesday. Brownback, who previously served in both the U.S. Congress and as Kansas governor, will succeed Ambassador John Ashe, according to a statement from the White House Office of Public Diplomacy. Brownback was nominated last year by then-acting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \u201cThe promotion of religious liberty around the world and its importance to the U.S. national interest have long been one of my priorities,\u201d said Brownback in a statement. \u201cIn my opinion, religious freedom is one of the defining national values of the United States, and those who support it must be the ones fighting for others who don\u2019t.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s first ambassador at large for religious freedom was appointed in 2016 by President Barack Obama. It does not appear that Brownback had been an official candidate for the role until his official nomination was announced last week. \u201cHe has a unique blend of faith and political experience,\u201d President Obama said in the announcement. \u201cMy administration is looking forward to working with the new ambassador to further advance our shared commitment to religious freedom and freedom of speech.\u201d Brownback said he supports religious liberty and religious freedom in his statement. \u201cThe promotion of religious liberty around the world and its importance to the U.S. national interest have long been one of my priorities,\u201d said Brownback. \u201cI will work tirelessly to promote the causes that I am passionate about, and to ensure our values are upheld by our diplomats around the world.\u201d Read our full coverage of Mr. Brownback :\nThe post Narrow vote ends in a victory for Brownback in U.S. Senate race appeared first on Christian Post - Home of Christian News and Commentary\nNinety-seven percent of the people vote in the election of U.S. Presidents - but for most, the election of senators isn\u2019t considered as important as the election of House members. There was a lot of media attention, and a lot of controversy, over the 2016 Senate Elections on November 3, 2016. This was mainly due to the fact that Donald Trump gained the Republican primary, but lost the national general election. This meant that the incumbent, Senator from California, Richard Durbin faced possible reelection problems if he continued with his campaign. However, the state\u2019s Democratic Party\u2019s leader in the Senate won a statewide primary, and a special election took place to fill the vacant seat. The new, elected senator was Democrat Raphael Warnock. The race for the Senate seat is considered to be the least important election in the United States, yet the results have greatly affected the United States. With a lot of attention, controversy, and controversy over the election, it didn\u2019t come as a surprise when Republican Marco Rubio was given a big raise in support and was named the nominee for the United States Senate from Florida. He was the first Republican to claim victory in the special election of the Senate seat. It happened during a night when it was not clear who won, but most people didn\u2019t see the race close. After having a very close race, the final result showed the Democrat of the Senate for the third straight election. This means that Republican lawmakers and supporters of President Trump will be able to control most of the members of the senators\u2019 committee. The following are the top reasons why Democrats\u2019 Marco Rubio won the election, and the reasons why Trump can still affect U.S. politics after this

{"prompt":"Former President Barack Obama , back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House , called on voters to reject a growing \u201c politics of division \u201d","text":"Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing \u201c politics of division \u201d and \u201c the toxic rhetoric and divisive tactics \u201d that are part of the 2020 campaign.\nHe pointed to the national violence that is already plaguing the country, but noted that the problem goes deeper and is a \u201c long story \u201d rooted in \u201c political polarization. \u201c\n\u201cThe current system of divided government is a disservice to the American people,\u201d a solemnly Trump-like voice from the podium said, \u201c and they must find a better system through elections and fair voting.\u201d\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, praised the Trump administration for trying to stop the country\u2019s worsening pandemic.\n\u201cI believe that the virus is under control,\u201d he said, \u201c And we\u2019re still here for the long haul. \u201c\nThis article is republished from by request.

There has been a flurry of tweets on what happens now. The president tweeted a little bit a day, and most members of his administration, and I think a lot of Republicans in Congress are also tweeting pretty frequently, which is part of the game today in politics. It\u2019s good to know that we have options.\nThe big thing on your mind is what happens to the President when it\u2019s all over? What is going on at this point in time from a security perspective? What are the implications for the American public? What can we expect from the president\u2019s security detail in the days and weeks, and months to come? How are you guys keeping up with what could happen?\nAaron: My advice is to do the research. I really recommend getting into social media and researching these people. I would also make sure you know what they can access and also research the information that they are sharing.\nFrom a security perspective, I have an intern in my office that is a military spouse. What are the policies, how do security clearances work? Do you need them? What is the process? I also recommend researching things that come up in conversations.\nI\u2019m an expert in the subject, but it\u2019s very important for you to know the situation before you comment on it.\nThis article is republished from by request. Please follow the links provided in our affiliate policy to access our original content.\nThe American people are already suffering deeply in this country. The people aren\u2019t suffering as much as this country has suffered. And I mean, the people that are suffering right now, the people in Baltimore right now are suffering. Whether it\u2019s the protests that happened in Washington for that reason, how can we protect them? Where\u2019s the responsibility? And in our country, what does the president have to say? What\u2019s the policy?\nWhat I know from my side of the house, how can we make sure everybody is protected, that we\u2019re not allowing the violence to continue.\nThese are the big things that are coming up over the next three weeks.

{"prompt":"Cyclone Ockhi barrelled into the Lakshwadeep islands in southwestern India on Saturday after drenching the neighboring states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu , claiming so far around 14 lives with many fishermen still feared trapped","text":"Cyclone Ockhi barrelled into the Lakshwadeep islands in southwestern India on Saturday after drenching the neighboring states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, claiming so far around 14 lives with many fishermen still feared trapped. The cyclonic storm, packing wind speeds of around 150 mph, hit the southern peninsula with heavy rains and rainy showers as far as the port city of Chennai, where its remnants still dumped up to 2 inches of rain. Officials said nearly 13,000 stranded fishermen in the Lakshadweep islands have been rescued. Thirteen people were among the casualties in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and Telangana. More than 4,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the Chennai metropolitan area, India's second largest city, after the cyclone struck. The Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) official bulletin says around 10,000 people were still missing after the cyclone swept across the southern and western Tamil Nadu and brought rain and flash floods there and across neighbouring districts of Karnataka. The IMD says Ockhi will make a'slow, northerly turn' on Sunday, heading towards the Malabar Coast, leaving the northwestern Karnataka coastline virtually dry. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has been deployed to rescue people trapped in cyclone-impacted low-lying areas after the state authorities stopped the evacuations for about an hour Saturday following a dispute over the safety of some of the 1,000 residents who are at the risk. The NDRF also said it would search for survivors in the Lakshadweep Islands. \"I do not want to alarm people, but the flood situation is getting more severe near Chennai. We have no idea how high the water level can get here as we did not encounter water levels we had feared earlier, but we will monitor the situation,\" the deputy commissioner of the State Disaster Management Committee in Tamil Nadu, Srikanth P, said. The cyclone caused major damage to several villages in the Lakshadweep Islands when it reached the islands Sunday morning and made landfall at 10 p.m. in Lakshadweep. There were reports of minor damage in the adjacent areas of Travancore, especially in villages at the Lakshadweep Islands boundary. At least five people have been confirmed killed as the Cyclone Ockhi hit southern and western Tamil Nadu. Some 13,000 people were still missing after Cyclone Ockhi razed many low-lying districts of the south and southwestern states of India. The cyclone swept through the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts on Saturday night, killing at least eight persons in the state, sending waves washing away vehicles on roads and destroying shops, and causing power supply to be disrupted in parts of Chennai city. An official statement said the Indian Navy rescued seven fishermen who had been stranded on a boat and seven other fishermen who had gone missing after Cyclone Ockhi battered the coasts of the southern Indian peninsula. The fishermen had been fishing in a small boat near the Andaman Islands on Saturday when Ockhi forced it into the ocean. They went into the deep waters. The officials said the Indian Navy had rescued seven fishermen who had been stranded on a boat and seven other fishermen who had gone missing after Cyclone Ockhi battered the southern Indian

{"prompt":"Former Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski , head of the opposition rightist VMRO-DPMNE party , resigned on Monday following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small Balkan country in April .","text":"Former Macedonian prime minister Nikola Gruevski, head of the opposition rightist VMRO-DPMNE party, resigned on Monday following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small Balkan country in April. Gruevski, who was in charge of a coalition government with Mr Petrovi\u0107's United Macedonian Movement, stepped down after his party scored only five seats [PDF] in the first-round legislative vote in April. \"The government will dissolve on Wednesday, and I will resign,\" Gruevski told TV channel Skai television. The country has already elected a new president, and the government will remain in power under the office of the new head of state. The opposition VMRO-DPMNE also plans to step down from government cooperation with the new coalition government, Gruevski said. \"The coalition will have a strong parliamentary majority and the government will continue with its operations in the most difficult economic circumstances, with the international sanctions that will follow soon,\" he said. The new president of Macedonia, Peko Pandele, has called for unity on the political scene. Pandele also said Sunday that he has been in \"constant dialogue\" with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev on what actions need to be taken in the country. His predecessor, Gruevski, was forced to resign after the disintegration of the anti-government coalition, ending his third government of two years in April amid wildfires in Greece, which led to the economic crisis of a Eurozone country. [PDF]\nA woman who has been convicted of lying to law enforcement and luring two teen boys into a motel room to sexually assault them in Pennsylvania has been sentenced to 50 years in prison. Jessica Johnson, age 28, had been convicted of two counts of sexual penetration of a minor in connection with two separate incidents in 2017 and 2018 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A third incident involving the same victim had been reported to police in November 2019. Johnson had lured two boys who did not know each other into a house on the Westside of Harrisburg, where they were sexually assaulted; the victim left the house only to return a few hours later. The first incident took place when Johnson lured the victims while they were walking home from the mall. The second occurred when the young boys had their cars in the shop and Johnson lured them into her house. She then left the boy inside the house when she went for a drink. When the victim left the house, he told a friend about what happened. The boy later called the police. A third incident took place in November 2019 when Johnson lured the same boy into her house. Two other witnesses reported what happened inside the house, including the victim. The prosecutor told the judge that Johnson would still seek a prison sentence but asked for a shorter sentence because of her age. The judge sentenced Johnson to 50 years in prison. [PDF]\nThe House has passed a bill that would allow law firms to charge for time spent with clients for phone calls, video or other videoconferencing. A bill that provides that services by which attorneys help with legal matters would not be taxable. The goal of House Bill 2656 is to help lawyers in rural areas that may not have as strong of an access to lawyers as in other parts of the country. Currently the rule states that attorneys and their clients should talk without charge. But the bill requires that these calls be compensated for. House Bill 2656 was introduced in November by Rep. Dave Chappelle (R-Dist. 35, Harrisburg Area) and Rep. Thomas L. Williams (R-Mt. Plymouth, Dist. 16, Newtown, Berks).

{"prompt":"U.S President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital could provide a lifeline to militants after the setbacks they suffered this year , the de facto leader of the United Arab","text":"U.S President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital could provide a lifeline to militants after the setbacks they suffered this year, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and one of several Gulf countries to recognize Israel recently, reportedly told Israeli media.\nThe decision by Washington on June 12 that the United States will officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital could provide a lifeline to the Palestinians after the setbacks they suffered this year, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and one of several Gulf countries to recognize Israel, reportedly told Israeli media after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.\nAccording to a report from Haaretz newspaper, he said that it could enable the Palestinians to regain a foothold in the region and in the hearts of the Arab-Muslim world, citing other countries that have agreed with Israel to take the same position.\nAlthough the official move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital wasn\u2019t given at the time in which it was announced, Trump has previously shown signs of agreeing to the move.\nTrump declared his decision in a tweet on June 12 on Twitter, confirming that the US embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem and that the US will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\u201cAt long last, I can announce that I\u2019ve given the President my full backing and support for the official transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. And by that move, we recognize Jerusalem as the eternal, undivided, capital of Israel,\u201d he wrote.\nTrump had suggested that Jerusalem was the \u201conly place,\u201d when he claimed that \u201cJerusalem remains under the sole administration of the Palestinian Authority,\u201d adding, \u201cBut, it is only a matter of time.\u201d\nOn May 20, Trump said he expected to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and had \u201cabsolutely\u201d no problem with it, and said the embassy would be located in East Jerusalem.\nThe US ambassador to the Palestinian Authority, David Friedman, said on that date that he hoped to return to the United States and be sent to Jerusalem in the coming days, as a \u201csignatory to the Abraham Accords, I will be sent to Jerusalem with the consent of the Palestinian Authority,\u201d The Washington Free Beacon reported.\nIn May 2017, Trump said that he didn t like the city of Jerusalem, and said later that Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel and of the Jewish state.\nIn February 2017, Trump had said: \u2018If I were elected president, I\u2019m pretty certain that I would relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, because that was a message that President Obama didn\u2019t really have the courage to send. \u2018 In May 2016, during the campaign for the U.S. presidential election, he said he wanted to keep the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and relocate it to Jerusalem within a year.\nThe Palestinian side of Jerusalem called on the Israelis to stop the transfer of the embassy to Jerusalem, and added that Washington s move to transfer the embassy to Jerusalem will result in a diplomatic conflict with the Palestinians.\nOn Wednesday, the Palestinian officials also demanded on several occasions that Israel stop its moves and stop settling in Jerusalem.\nIn addition, there are fears in the Israeli side that this move will have severe repercussions for the security and development of Jerusalem and in the Palestinian refugee camps around Jerusalem.\nWe have the largest and most complete database on the internet.

{"prompt":"U.S. Senate Republican whip John Cornyn said on Wednesday that Republicans appear to have enough votes to pass a budget measure that is vital to President Donald Trump \u2019 s aim of enacting tax reform","text":"U.S. Senate Republican whip John Cornyn said on Wednesday that Republicans appear to have enough votes to pass a budget measure that is vital to President Donald Trump \u2019 s aim of enacting tax reform by the end of the year.\nIf confirmed as FBI Director, James Comey would be the fifth former Obama administration official to serve that title and would follow the path of Hillary Clinton, Leon Panetta, John Brennan and Paula Broadwell \u2014 all of whom came before him and all of whom were ousted from office\nThe Republican Party could be split open on Donald Trump \u2019 s impeachment and whether to pursue a resolution for the president to be tried, according to a new poll released by the Washington Post-Mail.\nThe new results would bring the number of Democrats who want Trump to be impeached up to a majority, and that may be enough to force him off the Oval Office\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said he will be opening up new tax breaks for his supporters as early as later Friday, but said he is likely to \u201csign-off\u201d on a sweeping tax cut \u2013 which has been on the table since Trump was inaugurated \u2013 only after he leaves office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very big package,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday after he met with conservative activists in his Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good package.\u201d\nThe president said on Capitol Hill Wednesday during a campaign event that even if he signs all of the cuts in the tax package into law, that doesn\u2019t mean he would do it for \u201cfeelings.\u201d\nWhile talking about taxes on people making up to $250,000 from January 2020, President Donald Trump told Capitol Hill supporters, \"You know, if you get the tax cut, it's not because you feel good about it.\"\nTrump also noted that there are millions who are currently missing tax refund checks. The president's comments reflect his administration\u2019s longstanding stance on tax relief: The president will sign measures up to the $250,000 threshold, but he will not sign anything that would benefit higher income earners or businesses.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about this, and they keep trying to deceive you, to deceive you, to deceive you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money, so we\u2019re going to have to cut a big tax cut.\u201d\n\u201cWe always have to pay taxes so what am I going to do? I just say yes to the tax cuts. There\u2019s a lot of people paying taxes. And when you pay your taxes you\u2019re paying your federal taxes, all of the states taxes, all of that. But I\u2019m not going to sign any tax cut measures,\u201d he added.\nTrump isn\u2019t proposing new tax changes like he said at the beginning of his term, but will seek to add some of the changes proposed by lawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer, who has pushed the idea of a 10 percent tax on high-income earners and a 35 percent tax on top individual income tax brackets.\nTrump said the president will also sign off on another piece of legislation that would address his biggest legislative priority \u2013 bringing tax relief to people making less than $250,000 annually.

{"prompt":"Mexico is poised to recognize Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez as the winner of last month s election , according to a draft foreign ministry statement seen by Reuters , just days after the Organization","text":"Mexico is poised to recognize Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez as the winner of last month s election, according to a draft foreign ministry statement seen by Reuters, just days after the Organization of American States (OAS) backed the campaign of Honduras president-elect.\nHernandez, who won in last month s election, will receive recognition through diplomatic channels, according to the draft, which confirms the U.S. is doing so, and its ambassador to the OAS will be attending the swearing-in ceremony Tuesday.\nThe draft, prepared by Secretary of Foreign Affairs Luis Videgaray, says it is clear that the Honduran electoral process has been conducted in conformity with recognized international standards.\nHe noted Honduras has not asked for or received any form of technical verification. A formal request to do so has not been made, nor have OAS technical observers been allowed on the country s territory as the election unfolded.\nThe draft statement states: It is also clear that Mr. Hernandez has met his legal requirements to assume office on January 6. He has the majority of electors s votes, he has not been disqualified and is president-elect as determined by the Electoral Tribunal.\nHernandez will face the current president, Salvador Nasralla, and the OAS mission on Tuesday. The statement says Mexico and Honduras will continue collaborating together for stability and development of their relations.\nHernandez has not yet ruled out holding elections before January 6. He has yet to address an OAS mission to Honduras.\nOn Monday, the U.S. envoy to the OAS, Julie Chung, backed Hernandez in an OAS statement in Tegucigalpa. The statement urged Honduras to create an independent commission to investigate the electoral irregularities and attacks on the OAS mission and to hold transparent and peaceful elections in January.\nThe embassy of Honduras in Washington says Hernandez s team is working with the presidential transition team to ensure smooth relations between the administration of outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos and the administration of outgoing President and former rival to Hernandez Juan Manuel Lobo.\nForeign Minister Luis Videgaray was the head of a group of ministers from six Latin American nations in Miami that met last week with the election commissioners from Honduras. The group praised the transparency of the poll and criticized the political violence that was witnessed in the streets of Tegucigalpa.\nThe election results that were announced by the Honduran election commission, led by Juan De Dios Castillo, on April 27 indicated that Hern\u00e1ndez was on course to win with a narrow margin. He received 48.7% of the vote while Nasralla received 48.5%, as the OAS mission and other observers had concluded.\nThe results of the election, and the violence that accompanied the campaign, cast doubts on the legitimacy of the election and led to claims of fraud.\nThe U.S. ambassador, however, said in Miami that the election results as they were announced by the election commission showed that the vote cast in person by Honduran voters, on April 27, \"was not fraudulent. The United States supports the democratic transition process and elections scheduled for January 6th,\" Chung wrote on Twitter. He added that the United States urges \"continued support for the development of Honduras and its peaceful transition to democracy.\u201d\nLagos, Nigeria - Nigeria's military chief, Gen.

They said a lot of the provisions that were already agreed on could be accomplished by that date, along with most of their other key expectations.\nThe White House and congressional negotiators had initially been scheduled to meet on Thursday ahead of their joint statement Thursday, but both sides had to postpone their scheduled meeting.\nPresident Obama is looking forward to a swift passage of a tax bill as he aims to take executive action on immigration reform next week that would expand opportunities for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\u201c If we have a swift tax bill on our table,\u201d said acting director of national intelligence James Clapper at the White House, \u201c I can guarantee President Obama will use the first opportunity. In the second we can take a number of action. He\u2019s already committed to doing on Thursday. \u201c\nObama has called for a tax bill by the end of this week, his administration and allies say. If he were to fail, the president\u2019s allies said, he would have to consider taking some other steps to ensure that he receives the tax deal.\nAccording to a House Intelligence Committee aide, Republicans have shown they are willing to drop most of the provisions they have been insisting on from the package. They are now seeking a change to the current formula for taxpayer money for funding Medicare, with Obama\u2019s allies saying they prefer instead tax hikes in addition to the current tax system that could be enacted as a part of a deal.\n\u201c It is possible to have both the law and a tax reform package together,\u201d said a senior member in the White House who was briefed on tax negotiations Thursday.\n\u201c There is room to have a package by the middle of the year and a law by the end. The difference is where are the gaps between where we are comfortable with and where we want to get to, \u201c said the White House aide.\nEarlier on Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Shorter said that if the parties cannot reach an agreement, the Democrats would prefer to just get a Republican tax bill in the Senate that would extend an existing tax cut for high-income Americans. She also said that if that doesn\u2019t happen, Democrats remain dedicated to trying to have a bipartisan bill.\nIn his statement Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Seating said that although the deal was not yet at the point where any Republican bill could pass on the floor of Congress without Democratic support, he believed the Senate Republican leaders wanted to get a deal before Obama leaves Washington.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump is likely to continue to reach for bipartisan compromise on legislation , something he promised during the 2016 presidential campaign and that the American people expect , the White House said on","text":"President Donald Trump is likely to continue to reach for bipartisan compromise on legislation, something he promised during the 2016 presidential campaign and that the American people expect, the White House said on Thursday.\n\"One thing I'm really clear about at the end of the day, whether it's tax reform, whether it's a bill that deals with infrastructure, whether it's a deal on the border, we are going to reach our goal,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We will reach a bipartisan, fair compromise of all of this legislation. We would like to be able to do it quickly, but not as quickly as it'd taken the last administration 10 years to do.\n\"I'm certainly comfortable reaching out to everybody, but I would have to say at this point, in my opinion, I'm not convinced that the Republican leadership \u2014 certainly House leadership \u2014 are really willing to budge that far down the road, in their desire to win the mid-Atlantictheir way, that could potentially affect their ability to win the election in November of 2020.I think we probably have to assume a great deal of bipartisanship. I think we're going to have to have a great deal of compromise in some areas, to try and get something done.\"\nThe US has the world's largest economy. Its economy is highly competitive and global. The United States' economy is an important global driver of trade and is a significant financial center. For example, the US is a net exporter of capital goods (such as industrial machinery) and is a major importer of manufactured consumer goods.\nThe US economy is the most powerful economic, social and political influence in the world. According to the United Nations' statistical yearbook, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States is more than twice that of the next largest economy, Japan (GDP per head of population), and the US economy is by far the most powerful economic and social influence in the world. The United States has also the world's largest economy in nominal terms. The GDP was $ 2 trillion in 2019.\nThe per capita GDP of the United States surpassed the figures at the end of 2018 ($ 44,000) and was the highest since 2008. In nominal terms, however, the GDP of the US is only slightly smaller than that of Brazil ($ 53,900) by the end of 2018.\nThe US economy has the largest economy in the world. This is clearly marked by the annual average growth rate of 3. 8 percent since 2000. As a result, the American economy is currently experiencing one of its longest economic expansions, and many experts expect that the US economy may continue to expand very strongly for a long time to come. On average, growth rate in the US economy has been 3. 8 percent.\nHowever, with an average annual growth rate of 3. 8 percent, it is not quite easy to get there. Especially in recent decades, although the US economy has seen an increase in GDP compared to the previous year, the growth rate has fallen to a low average level. In recent years, the American economy has been expanding more and more, but its rate has fallen every year.\nThe current rate has fallen to 2. 5 percent. The US economy is currently shrinking faster than before and slower than the global average rate for this period (estimated at 1. 4 percent). There is a lot of talk about the \"Trump effect\" and the US economy shrinking. At this stage of the economy, there is no doubt that the economy is shrinking, there is something wrong with the \"Trump effect\", but the US economy is shrinking, with an average decline of 2. 5

Reuters has not edited the statements","text":"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @ realDonaldTrump and @ POTUS. The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\n#MeToo will go forward now, not because of all the things that have just been done, but because they have done something about it. They are in way bigger trouble. They will face a whole lot of trouble.\nIt\u2019s going too far. I hope they go to jail.\nThe U.S. Department of Education is reviewing allegations of sexual misconduct against top administration officials, including a high-ranking official in the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, @ OfficeOfCivilRights.\nHiring process for assistant district attorneys should be stopped now and again.\nI don\u2019t understand why our elected officials are allowed this much power over people. They will use it every single moment to try to control us and get us to do their bidding.\nI wish the whole political system had been overthrown now.\nThe people are sick of this.\nSome of the biggest corporations are involved.\nIt just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense anymore. It was clear what they were up to way before they went public.\nThe US government should be outlawed.\nTrump has the power to do what he wants. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it. It\u2019s not democratic. It\u2019s not normal. We\u2019ve lost our country.\nThis isn\u2019t a case of the victims being wrong for complaining. This is about sexism. It\u2019s about sexist people in public positions saying, \u201cWe can do anything we want to do to anyone, including sex, anytime,\u201d and it\u2019s not OK for us.\nThis is a case of a patriarch who can\u2019t be accountable to his family for his behavior and he uses a position to say, \u201cI can do whatever I want. But you\u2019re not allowed to speak up because you\u2019re my wife. You\u2019re not allowed to speak up because you\u2019re my secretary. You\u2019re not allowed to speak up because you\u2019re my friend. It\u2019s all right because I\u2019m in charge of you and I can do whatever I want to you just as long as I don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d This is what this is about.\nIt\u2019s about sexism. It is about the fact that we have more power for women over men than we would have in any other country, and they are used as bargaining chips.\nWe did not vote for Trump, and this is a very unfortunate decision. Now he\u2019s being given tremendous power at the White House. We have to be careful of what is coming from the Democratic party.\nIt\u2019s about power. It\u2019s about sexism. It\u2019s about the fact that women, and black people, and all those people of color, don\u2019t have as much power.\nThere is no justice. This is a terrible travesty.\nIt\u2019s a travesty that there is any power at all. It\u2019s an abdication of our political system.

Donors","text":"The failure by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans to dismantle Obamacare has infuriated the party \u2019 s conservative flank and is intensifying intra-party warfare ahead of the 2018 U.S. congressional elections. Donors and activists on Capitol Hill are pushing for a breakaway Republican-run health care plan. The move could help energize the party at a time that it appears vulnerable, with Democratic Congressmen and Senators overwhelming the party \u2019 s support in surveys and surveys that show the party \u2019 s public opinion standing in sharp contrast to those of \u2026 [Read more...] about Conservative GOP Health Policies: How the Obamacare Breakdown Shaped the Trump Administration\u2019s Healthy Choice Act\nThe U.S. presidential inauguration ceremony was held on the East Coast Jan. 20. This year, President-elect Joseph Biden addressed an empty audience and did not include Trump, but there were still a few moments of high drama. One of the most dramatic was when Trump was forced to walk away from his inauguration ceremony after refusing to concede the election to Biden, despite the strong arguments put forth by Senate \u2026 [Read more...] about U.S. President-elect\u2019s inauguration: Watch highlights of key moments of Joe Biden \u2019 s inauguration\nPresident Trump has received more than 3.2 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for free or at far-lower prices since he took office in January. That equates to more than 80 percent of the nation \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine, which includes both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The figure is about the same percentage as all of the national healthcare budget for the year. As the president has worked to increase his administration \u2019 s coronavirus response, he has been careful to \u2026 [Read more...] about President Trump is \u2018The Greatest President in History\u2019: How the pandemic has changed the White House\nU.S. President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders that revoke previous Trump administration health policy changes. The first executive order Trump signed Monday, while on the State of the Union, is a document directing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review the regulatory approval process for COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, devices, and treatments. Last August, Trump announced plans for major changes to the CDC in response \u2026 [Read more...] about Coronavirus Pandemic: What the President can do now to combat the virus\nIt may sound impossible, but the world\u2019s richest men are becoming more socially conscious and are trying to find a way forward for the future.\nAs the price of petrol and electricity continues to rise and oil reserves are nearly depleted, the world needs more sustainable solutions.\nIn order to do that, global megacorporations are investing heavily in electric vehicles \u2013 where an electric car can produce little, or no, pollution during operation. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in just one second \u2013 and in fact, in countries such as China where electric vehicles don\u2019t have any emission standards, you can drive almost anywhere.\nDespite its great benefits, the electric car isn\u2019t necessarily a car for everyone: If you\u2019re in Europe or America, you may have to wait an extended period of time for the type of batteries that can be used in an electric car to reach the market. However, thanks to the Internet, we now have a solution that is much faster: the electric motorcycle.\nOn the other hand, thanks to its design which fuses two different types of motorcycles \u2013 a large cruiser with larger tires, and a motorcycle without much frame, with a small tire \u2013 the scooter also stands out for its modern

{"prompt":"Maltese police have arrested 10 suspects in the murder of anti-corruption blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia , the country s prime minister said on Monday , almost two months after she was killed when her car","text":"Maltese police have arrested 10 suspects in the murder of anti-corruption blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, the country s prime minister said on Monday, almost two months after she was killed when her car was hit by a bomb-laden truck.\nThe chief executive for Malta and Gozo, Lawrence Gonzi, has condemned the killing, the first of a prominent journalist since the country moved to democracy in 1964, saying it was beyond belief that whoever had been behind the assassination had had its work cut out to avoid being detected.\nHe added that there was every reason to assume that the attack which killed Ms Caruana, an environmentalist, was motivated primarily by professional animosity.\nBut Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was 49, was found dead on the night of Oct 17, 2017, hours after being targeted by a booby-trapped van on her way home from a party. Police found a small amount of explosive under the front door of her apartment.\nIt later emerged Ms Caruana had been working for years on an expos\u00e9 that may have linked a senior Maltese politician to drug trafficking, corruption and gambling.\nLiam Lynch, a veteran police informant and intelligence officer who worked closely with Ms Caruana Galizia, said she was constantly under surveillance.\n\"She had a very sensitive job, as the director of the Malta Intelligence Service (MIS) and she was on top of everything,\" he told The Associated Press.\nShe was the second woman and the first of nationality from the West to head the intelligence agency.\nMs Caruana Galizia, who went by Daphne but cared for by her friends as Dafne, also spent some time at the Centre for Investigation of Economic Delinquency, or CIED, a Maltese investigative group which covered a large range of topics, particularly the environment. Ms Caruana was a part of the organisation for about two years.\nThe two organisations had long clashed. Ms Caruana Galizia s colleagues at the CIED had accused her of taking a too confrontational attitude.\nLynch said the intelligence work on which Ms Caruana Galizia was the expert was carried out by staff who knew the target well. It was not part of official MI5 operations or other MI5 intelligence branches - although the agency does have an official liaison with the CIED.\nLynch said Ms Caruana Galizia was constantly talking to people who worked elsewhere and knew the target. This was likely to be a small group of informers, he said.\nThe Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, speaking in a televised address on Monday, said he saw no evidence that MI5 was involved. He also told the PMQs parliament that it was not possible to link any of the suspects arrested so far in the case to those mentioned by Mr Lynch.\n\"I have not heard of anything like this being considered nor discussed in the cabinet,\" she said.\nMr Gonzi said the government would not wait around for \"political games\" and had called on international counterparts to take action.\nA British Foreign Office spokeswoman said the UK would not comment specifically on any investigation and added that MI5 has no formal link to the Maltese police.\nWhen asked when his government would issue an apology, Mr Muscat said it was \"too early\" to judge the timing and if it should go to the public.\nBut the prime minister was less direct about the alleged involvement of MI5. He said it was not the first time a journalist had been killed in the country.\n\"That has happened in the past, unfortunately, and we will not tolerate the perpetrators, whoever they

{"prompt":"Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Thursday Qatar was ready to sit down with fellow Gulf Arab states to resolve any dispute but he said sovereignty was not subject to compromise . Speaking","text":"Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Thursday Qatar was ready to sit down with fellow Gulf Arab states to resolve any dispute but he said sovereignty was not subject to compromise. Speaking during an event on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Qatar National Day, the emir said he did not rule out sitting down with countries experiencing disputes with Qatar or countries that had cut ties with Qatar. He said Qatar was willing to sit down with countries for dialogue on all issues, without preconditions, including sovereignty. \u201cWe are ready to sit down with our brothers in the Gulf [Arabs] to discuss issues, including sovereignty, in the context of dialogue and negotiation,\u201d said Emir Tamim. He said Qatar would \u201cnot have any problems\u201d in doing so. The emir spoke on November 7, 2017, the day he delivered his opening remarks at a workshop dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Qatar National Day. He did not specifically mention any countries but said he would call their ambassadors to Doha to discuss issues. In September this year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and closed their airspace, ports and land borders. They demanded the country close four militant Doha-linked groups and to punish Qatari officials for what they called \u201csanctions-busting\u201d and support of terrorism in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and the UAE accused Qatar of encouraging militant groups and of supporting terrorism, while the Egyptians accused Doha of being a \u201csponsor of terrorism in Bahrain and the Yemen War and of interfering in internal affairs. Bahrain\u2019s King has urged Qatar\u2019s emir to resolve differences with neighbours. He told Qatari ruler Tamim in an annual letter on the occasion of the anniversary of the establishment of the Emirate on November 7, 2017, to \u201cspeak peacefully\u201d with neighbours, avoiding any confrontation that could lead to damage to any of the four Gulf countries. Speaking outside the palace at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition and Convention Center, Sheikh Mohammed said the kingdom had sent the letter to Tamim \u201cas you continue to be the head and representative of the entire Gulf\u201d. \u201cWe appreciate you for making a conscious effort to avoid any new crises or conflict between countries\u201d and for your \u201cactive role to reach a mutually acceptable solution to maintain stability and security and to preserve our common positions\u201d, he said. Bahrain\u2019s Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa had urged Tamim to address the issue facing the Gulf Cooperation Council and his role in the Arab region with diplomatic, rather than military means. Sheikh Mohammed was speaking at a conference on \u201cBuilding Stability and Confidence in Asia and the Arab World\u201d in Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Mohammed also met on Tuesday evening in the capital with his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong. Sheikh Mohammed called the meeting \u201chistoric\u201d. The emir said in a statement that he discussed the Gulf region including the situation that the countries are facing, \u201cso that security and prosperity can be guaranteed for all\u201d. Sheikh Mohammed said the two countries have maintained \u201cstrategic relations\u201d and agreed on strengthening them. They also talked about \u201cinterests and shared goals and objectives\u201d, he said, without elaborate.

{"prompt":"Investors looking for the U.S. Republican tax bill to prompt multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars and end the worst slide in the greenback in a decade may have to temper their hopes","text":"Investors looking for the U.S. Republican tax bill to prompt multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars and end the worst slide in the greenback in a decade may have to temper their hopes.\nAt least one Wall Street economist said the tax changes put on the table by a Republican-led conference committee last week to get Democrats onboard might not result in enough tax cuts to get a bill through Congress in time for the summer meeting of the World Economic Forum in early June in Davos.\nA lack of tax cuts in the bill sent U.S. shares falling on Monday and prompted the U.S. dollar to retreat as well.\n\u201cThe economy is going through quite a difficult phase,\u201d said Andrew Burr, a U.S. equity strategist at HSBC Private Bank in New York. \u201cIt is quite tough to get rid of taxes.\u201d\nThe Republican tax bill would impose a 25 percent tax on top international profits up to US$100 million (S$135 million) \u2014 and the tax would be increased as long as a company continues to have a U.S. holding company \u2014 similar to a provision in last year\u2019s Republican tax bill that expired with the end of the year.\nBut it would not go as far as a proposal from President Bush that would add to both the existing corporate and personal tax rates with the goal of cutting annual GDP growth by US$2 trillion over the next decade. That proposal faces more obstacles, said Dan Zekman, chief U.S. economist at UBS Group.\nHe expects that the GOP tax bill would bring revenue in the range of US$400 billion to US$500 billion over 10 years. But UBS strategists and others said a bill of that kind would have to be approved by a two-thirds shareholder vote in a Congress with a Democratic majority.\nThe proposal by the conference committee of 10 Republican senators and U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief economist Richard L. Hatch is for revenue in the range of US$300 billion to US$400 billion.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pushing for the tax cuts to be tied to a broader economic stimulus package.\nU.S. lawmakers also appear inclined to spend far more on education and environmental programs, said Larry McDonald, director of tax policy at the Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has been working on legislation to lower the personal income tax rate in a broader economic stimulus package, Mr. McDonald noted.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a floor on tax hikes in this conference committee, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get an agreement on that floor,\u201d Mr. McDonald said.\nU.S. lawmakers have already extended the current Bush tax cut, which ends in the first week of June, for six weeks to the end of May. The cut is estimated to cost the U.S. economy US$1.5 trillion in lost tax revenue this year alone, but the Congressional Budget Office has not yet calculated how much money that will save the U.S. economy in the long run.\nBut the economic impact of longer-term tax cuts may be limited because of the uncertainty over the next federal budget, which comes into effect later this year when the Bush tax cuts end. Democrats, which control the U.S. House of Representatives, are pushing for a big bump in tax revenues by tying part of the spending increase with spending cuts.\nMeanwhile, in a sign of the economic challenges facing the United States, a U.S.-China trade war intensified in recent days as Chinese officials demanded the U.S. government end its subsidies for Boeing and

The move to cease official relations will apply from August 29, Brazil s foreign ministrys ambassador and Venezuelan foreign ministrys ambassador will be replaced with diplomats charged with coordinating relations between the two countries. In Washington, Caracas denounced the move, calling it unilateral and an act of political cowardice. The government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Venezuelan envoys to Brazil would be replaced with envoys from neighboring Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. The decision by Brazil s government is the latest in a string of moves by some of Latin America s biggest countries to distance themselves from an embattled, oil-dependent country that went into recession last year. Most Latin American countries have denounced its political instability while Venezuela has been forced to seek debt relief from its international creditors. Venezuela is in talks with creditor parties to avoid repayment of more than $130 billion due by the end of March. The Venezuelan president s government has sought to shore up its currency with government bonds for a year in an effort to stave off a possible dollarization of the national economy. In the last 18 months, the venezuelan peso has lost about 97 percent of its value. (Reporting by Maria Alejandra SalazarEditing by Donal Lawrance)\nLONDON, Sept. 3, 2013 (AFP) - The government of Britain said on Monday that it did not intend to extradite the Spanish pope Francis, despite an arrest warrant issued at his request. In a statement to AFP, the British government announced that Francis did not want to be extradited to Italy, which prosecutors consider to be under its mandate. Italian police are investigating the alleged pedophile scandal involving the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome over the past three decades. Investigators want to question him about the allegations, which have been exposed by the Spanish media. The church has denied wrongdoing. \"We are concerned about reports of corruption and abuse. We will always be ready to bring in all cases that appear seriously. But as we have said time and time again, we do not share Spain's jurisdiction, \" the British government's statement said. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the British Interior Ministry has refused to extradite Francis to Italy, which would put him at risk of imprisonment.\nThe former New Zealand All Blacks coach Dan Carter has agreed a coaching contract at the newly formed French Pro League side Toulouse, reported the France Football magazine on Wednesday. The 45-year-old Carter was the All Blacks' head coach from 2014-16. He won the world cup in 2011 and 2015. Carter also has an association with the All Blacks' current and former players. The player-coach worked for his current club South Africa at the end of his professional career. He started his career in 1995 at Northampton Saints and coached several high level clubs, including Super Rugby club Waratahs. He also spent 15 years in charge of the New Zealand national rugby league team. The former rugby union and rugby league star, who lives in Toulouse, will bring his New Zealand experience and expertise in top class rugby to Toulouse, which played in the French Top 14 from 2011-13. It won the French Cup with a famous victory over SU Agen this season as well, after finishing last on the log.

{"prompt":"A Beijing court on Thursday handed down jail sentences of up to 15 years to 85 people deported from Kenya for telecoms fraud , including 44 from self-ruled Taiwan , an island Beijing claims as","text":"A Beijing court on Thursday handed down jail sentences of up to 15 years to 85 people deported from Kenya for telecoms fraud, including 44 from self-ruled Taiwan, an island Beijing claims as its own.\nChina's ruling Communist Party's foreign affairs commission said the sentences were part of an investigation involving Beijing telecoms firm Tsinghua Unigroup.\nThe company had accused the 86 convicts of using their Kenyan passports to make payments on phone contracts for Chinese people.\n\"This was organised as a large-scale and coordinated fraud,\" said the foreign affairs commission, which also said the convictions reflected the \"extremely severe punishment\" for crimes in the country.\nThe arrests and deportations followed Beijing's crackdown on foreigners using unlicensed cellular phone service.\nTsinghua Unigroup, which operates China Mobile and China Telecom, told the court that the convict's had been trying to make illegal payments on accounts in their favour, but it said it had not verified the identities of the individuals.\nTaiwanese police have arrested more than 4,200 people for the same offences. Most are now held without bail.\nChina Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing's move was to combat illegal immigration and provide for China's national security.\nKenyan officials had earlier alleged that Taiwanese companies had exploited unlicensed services in the country.\nThe 86 deportations were made public on the day that parliament approved a new law which will allow Chinese police to arrest immigrants on suspicion of illegal telecoms service.\nHundreds of thousands of Chinese emigrants from rural communities live outside China, many of whom are in low-skill jobs and take jobs without proper paperwork.\nOne of the deportations was of a Chinese woman called Chen Yue. She said she was sent to the far southwestern province of Guizhou.\nChen, who does not want to give her surname, said she was sent to a special treatment camp in November after she had allegedly broken a law by opening up an account in her husband's name without having it checked for fraud.\nChen said she had been locked in a cell with other people for three days.\nShe said, \"I thought they could kill me,\" adding that she had not been allowed out or to visit friends and family in the city of Guiyang, about 1,200 kilometres from where she was detained.\nShe said that guards had given her the choice of signing a confession document or confessing her guilt or facing the death penalty.\n\"I thought they are going to kill me if I ask some questions,\" she said.\n\"I had to sign on the form, but I wrote my name with the surname of my husband.\"\nAccording to the official China's People's Daily, Chen was stripped naked and beaten by police.\nChen said her husband now does not want her to leave the camp and has refused to sign a document acknowledging his guilt for signing Chen's name while she was in custody.\nThe Chinese government estimates that about 2.7 million people are working in illegally in the economy, mostly in low-skill jobs.\nOn Tuesday, a foreign minister's team from Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar visited Beijing for talks on immigration violations, according to China's foreign ministry.\nAt least 18 million people are estimated to be living overseas, out of a total population of 1.3 billion.\nThe figure is believed to be a significant underestimate given that many of the people in question are undocumented.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman said his government would work to resolve the problem but that the country

{"prompt":"Ousted Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo , charged with three counts of corruption for offences that allegedly took place two decades ago , was denied bail on Monday and will be detained in custody until","text":"Ousted Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo, charged with three counts of corruption for offences that allegedly took place two decades ago, was denied bail on Monday and will be detained in custody until after the hearings are conducted.\nChombo, 51, was denied bail on charges that he stole US$2 million (R7.4m) from the state-owned Bank of Industry (BOI). He\u2019s alleged to have embezzled funds taken from the bank\u2019s commercial business arm \u2013 the Bank of Zimbabwe, to invest in the privately owned Harare Insurance Company (HIC). The case has also implicated a fellow BOI employee, David Khambani.\nThe charge sheet says that Chombo and Khambani received US$5 million in investment for a HIC company on the false pretence that the money was required to bail out the Bank of Industry, and then went on to borrow US$2 million as agreed. The money was repaid later under duress.\nThis is the second prosecution in connection with the fraud after a former HIC director in charge of marketing, David Hickling, was sentenced in 2017 to seven years in jail for taking the money of the bank into the insurance company.Hickling is alleged to have spent the money fraudulently, although he was acquitted in July of misappropriating another $1.3m that the bank supposedly loaned to HIC. A three-judge commission had earlier convicted Hickling after he was convicted at trial after pleading guilty.\n\u201cThis case has not been straightforward to deal with even though there have been several delays and interruptions in the trial.\u201d\n\u201cThe appeal by the defence team in respect of the bail application will continue at court, and the trial of the defendants will commence accordingly.\u201d\nFew African countries have been hit by the global Covid-19 pandemic as hard as Zimbabwe, where President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a state of emergency. The economy suffered the most in any nation that has reported a coronavirus outbreak.\nZimbabwe is struggling to cope with a shortage of food and oxygen, and health professionals have been on strike for weeks, refusing to undertake covid-19 patients.\nIn total, at least five people have died of Covid-19 in the country, with infections peaking at 5,000 a week in early March. Since then, deaths have fallen but infections have soared since the authorities relaxed lockdown rules.\nThe crisis has resulted in the resignation of Mnangagwa\u2019s two main advisers, health minister Jonathan Moyo and foreign affairs minister David Muluzi.Mnangagwa has faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic, with foreign envoys and diplomats describing the country\u2019s handling of the outbreak as poor.\nA major outbreak of cholera in the city of Gweru has seen more than 800 deaths, in a region that has been hit by a lack of basic services and sanitation.\nCholera cases continue to appear in the worst drought areas of Zimbabwe, as the country gears up for a rainy year, with Zimbabwe\u2019s southern border with South Africa reopened.\nThe latest cholera outbreak in Gweru was diagnosed on Sunday, in the southern region which has already been ravaged by the lack of infrastructure and the poor healthcare system.\nWhile in South Africa, Makhaya Ncube, chief nurse

{"prompt":"President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would be forced to retaliate if Washington pressed ahead with what he called illegal new sanctions against Moscow , describing U.S. conduct towards his country as boorish","text":"President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would be forced to retaliate if Washington pressed ahead with what he called illegal new sanctions against Moscow, describing U.S. conduct towards his country as boorish and arrogant.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have been pressing for new economic sanctions and restrictions on Russia over the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and allegations of a murder of former spy Sergei Skripal in Britain. Washington has also imposed targeted sanctions on several high-ranking Russian officials, including Putin's eldest son, to pressure Moscow over aiding Ukraine's pro-Russian government.\nBut Putin's comments suggest Kremlin is now unlikely to allow the West to push Russia back far enough.\n\"We, as the Russian people, and now I specifically mean the government of Russia, should have some idea how we have done or can do some things,\" Putin said at an industry event that follows the U.S. sanctions on Russia. \"Boristiousness, boorishness, arrogance, are things that do not come to the forefront of a leader's policy but they are very good at destroying people.\"\nTrump has accused Putin of aiding the Ukrainian president who has refused to step down. The United States has imposed new sanctions and targeted sanctions against Russia on several issues, including Ukraine and Crimea.\nThe latest sanctions come amid tensions across Europe with President Donald Trump angered by the EU's failure to impose additional sanctions on the Russian government, after failing in negotiations with Moscow.\nU.S. President Donald Trump (L) shakes hands with Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko during a meeting in the Oval Office at the White House Tuesday, March 4, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo\/Evan Vucci, Pool Photo, File)\nTrump's comments on Thursday, which followed meetings in Brussels of top European leaders, appeared in part to stem from the U.S.'s inability to secure the U.S. allies to impose any further sanctions against the Russian president's government.\nTrump said on Monday he wanted to go beyond what the U.S. Europe leaders agreed in their meetings.\n\"We were talking very strongly about additional sanctions for Russia, and we could not get the European Union leaders to take any additional action\" on Moscow, Trump said at an appearance alongside German foreign minister Heiko Maas and Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz at the White House.\nTrump said the U.S. was willing to pursue stronger sanctions but that the Europeans had \"dropped\" in the talks.\nIn late January, Trump signed a law imposing new sanctions against Russia, targeting dozens of top Russian officials and a number of companies. Trump is still under intense pressure from some Republican lawmakers, including some leading Trump campaign donors who have been pushing for new moves against Russia.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement Wednesday it had targeted 19 people and nine entities for additional sanctions related to President Vladimir Putin on sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, in a separate measure not related to Ukraine.\nOn Thursday Putin claimed that U.S. sanctions \"will not have any consequences except for a weakening\" for Russia by Russia's ally, which is one of the U.S. targets for new sanctions.\n\"Who else will be forced to impose counter-sanctions? Who else will be forced to react in an appropriate fashion? There is the clear answer,\" Putin said.\nFor Putin the move came as a rebuke of what he called the West's attempt to \"encourage\" violence in the Ukraine crisis between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists by using \"blackmail\" tactics and the threat of sanctions, warning that the West is attempting to isolate Russia as an increasingly powerful economic and military power in Europe.","token_len":755,"entropy":[9.7802,0.0532,2.6538,1.5534,2.3105,0.4588,1.7486,1.6959,3.5748,5.0862,0.1135,6.0129,1.7522,4.1951,8.5629,1.4069,0.0607,6.243,1.4707,0.5925,7.4383,5.556,0.3538,1.5024,1.9278,2.8401,6.3133,5.2171,0.0005,0.0235,0.0503,7.7408,6.1132,7.1835,0.1911,0.1424,11.4648,0.6597,0.0087,1.1838,6.5128,0.0845,0.137,18.3287,0.0014,0.0157,0.03,0.9159,0.5677,0.0086,2.8178,2.9764,3.0477,1.0716,1.8737,3.6248,1.063,3.6223,4.1705,0.0819,3.8358,5.2107,0.173,1.9414,3.6902,1.0926,6.2401,0.2911,0.0138,0.1696,4.6302,1.7584,2.2449,6.7266,0.5482,2.6507,8.2091,2.4482,5.3808,5.9049,2.1053,4.8783,0.1629,0.0066,3.7159,11.6222,0.629,5.9591,0.8797,2.1181,3.5541,6.9865,1.2678,0.33,3.4486,4.531,0.063,0.6726,1.0469,0.2073,1.2682,0.2919,3.4689,1.6209,4.8905,0.1113,0.738,6.5515,4.4171,1.2115,4.2595,10.4147,3.1938,1.2655,2.2787,0.0013,0.7016,3.825,0.7711,0.2995,3.7375,2.6493,2.0048,2.156,4.779,7.6384,4.8617,3.4578,6.1086,0.0048,5.0466,1.5225,4.835,0.0937,4.5023,5.4985,2.055,7.226,0.2129,2.2952,0.6037,0.8635,1.7044,6.1408,1.7191,1.9928,3.9556,1.5163,0.1232,5.5325,6.5038,6.0449,8.1203,4.6246,0.9736,4.6966,0.4453,1.2682,0.1794,3.5756,3.3003,4.1072,3.9474,2.5077,2.2523,4.5949,4.4348,6.2527,4.6238,0.0604,4.1685,2.0593,2.4213,0.5533,0.4055,2.309,2.1947,6.5174,2.2358,5.3543,6.4915,1.703,3.117,0.0007,0.2035,0.4203,3.9082,2.8108,0.5219,0.7303,0.9142,8.2766,5.4036,5.1899,12.9291,2.5923,1.487,5.421,0.0146,0.0532,0.073,0.3958,2.8551,0.8196,4.9941,3.8703,0.6772,4.789,0.1076,3.6498,2.0589,2.1049,2.635,0.6362,4.5527,5.6298,0.6878,5.4432,3.9742,3.0505,1.4606,3.2274,4.8738,3.4788,7.6749,3.4577,1.865,0.0944,2.6423,1.9729,4.7345,0.881,0.0926,6.091,1.7114,2.5736,2.8842,5.8736,2.13,4.319,0.0747,3.3349,0.0835,1.6469,2.6273,3.2775,0.0743,1.0384,3.5209,1.9828,0.4885,2.8379,4.6122,5.3962,1.7557,2.0274,3.5764,2.2876,6.0211,1.123,0.1557,4.0014,1.5338,3.2701,0.5707,0.5958,2.3443,3.804,2.5633,3.0179,2.3014,3.9891,5.9984,2.5934,3.9856,3.8989,0.7702,0.0073,8.6886,0.2254,1.8991,4.5535,0.2046,3.3499,0.0345,3.4587,4.7478,0.7718,0.7351,3.7929,0.9237,1.5991,2.4325,4.0554,5.1384,3.8356,5.1374,1.2102,1.2357,1.8291,0.7759,3.3341,0.0009,0.0339,0.034,1.2431,0.2136,0.0155,3.1796,1.6426,0.0855,2.2537,0.0095,0.0451,3.1072,4.7082,0.2477,0.0002,0.0,1.8949,0.4622,1.3095,1.3308,1.07,1.6178,0.0038,3.2603,0.6245,0.0634,0.0005,7.2323,0.533,2.7887,3.3932,0.0137,10.392,1.5585,0.0566,0.0209,0.2884,0.8439,0.853,0.0232,0.0169,2.7188,0.236,0.0003,0.0,2.0986,1.9891,4.2842,4.5403,1.0149,0.0327,0.6723,2.6285,1.634,2.5891,2.8017,0.7745,3.3092,1.897,3.7153,4.8809,1.7971,1.873,2.8001,3.6886,1.421,0.7729,0.9772,3.6749,5.6586,4.8626,0.2678,6.0094,2.8875,2.3219,3.058,0.0005,0.0138,1.4939,1.0087,5.5382,0.0271,4.9506,2.707,4.3014,0.0006,0.4001,0.3485,5.5577,3.1242,5.1084,3.5359,2.8415,0.7051,1.3028,3.1305,0.788,3.6421,3.6736,1.3456,0.6911,0.5144,2.4871,2.5437,2.1287,4.5772,2.0929,3.2501,0.6694,5.1509,3.2422,2.9266,2.2751,1.5664,0.0005,0.0204,0.0173,9.7768,3.9104,1.5412,3.0677,4.4259,5.2978,2.6851,0.7826,0.2412,1.3696,4.9334,2.6459,5.9366,2.2941,0.3399,6.8337,0.3137,3.8236,0.6964,1.3836,1.6555,1.7419,4.7787,1.3583,1.4999,2.382,3.0435,0.9764,6.4368,0.1856,3.8506,2.013,4.0131,1.5457,6.8594,1.3455,3.5328,1.068,0.6403,0.4413,2.0496,1.4855,4.8993,7.1826,1.8401,7.3622,0.0415,6.6956,0.0037,0.0203,0.0012,3.0097,4.4052,7.1733,1.5563,0.0067,0.0005,4.8546,0.6183,2.9345,0.0004,0.3033,0.3541,1.9151,2.162,1.9747,1.307,0.0005,0.0063,0.0708,2.3777,3.443,0.039,4.616,5.9407,1.0606,4.1411,1.9759,1.9682,3.0834,2.3362,2.7247,8.502,0.2197,3.1226,4.3161,2.8893,3.5052,0.9759,0.375,3.6606,5.6337,2.0719,0.0953,1.5298,3.9039,1.0257,3.7458,4.3059,0.7242,0.4766,1.8683,0.5381,1.9197,5.6763,5.9228,0.0389,3.7583,2.4141,0.3331,1.3554,3.9119,1.9152,0.0572,3.6575,1.5997,3.4664,4.2191,4.3574,4.062,2.5288,0.3035,0.6985,3.695,4.5694,0.6489,2.2679,1.042,4.1925,4.3193,3.7593,2.0585,3.7588,2.805,1.1684,2.9096,2.635,0.6534,2.9924,7.0022,1.8533,0.8532,0.5156,0.3172,2.3379,2.1922,0.0004,0.007,0.0663,3.3495,0.24,1.7602,2.1256,1.1126,0.7012,3.4301,1.8239,1.9481,7.3459,5.6354,3.275,2.2047,5.8676,3.4632,2.1264,3.4338,0.5374,4.9037,0.0023,6.2527,0.8293,0.0434,5.2967,6.7363,1.9084,2.5137,3.2881,0.9106,0.6776,2.1302,4.5322,2.8557,4.6026,4.8862,6.9912,2.5675,0.0025,4.6314,0.419,0.6474,3.8966,1.0787,6.487,6.5344,1.6019,2.1181,0.0003,0.0022,0.0702,1.1446,4.337,3.0199,1.1414,3.6023,0.9084,4.9353,6.2697,1.4672,3.012,6.3643,3.1143,6.3456,1.6316,5.5766,4.4124,1.0034,4.3836,1.6531,2.8051,2.4201,4.9522,0.1749,0.7738,3.4109,0.0007,0.0037,0.9007,5.4989,1.6863,1.9211,0.5635,0.6132,0.5166,2.2191,7.1624,4.8448,2.3803,1.2194,4.4838,0.2189,4.7149,8.0992,1.0587,1.2978,0.0049,2.3858,2.3288,0.246,0.3653,0.5582,0.627,0.0538,6.3593,2.7389,3.3317,3.9009,2.5367,1.8087,4.3052,1.152,5.5721,6.7477,3.951,2.0522,0.3622,0.2324,1.0408,0.453,6.0127,2.8966,5.4424,3.3288,3.7593,0.9999,2.7836,5.079,1.7562,3.6635,0.2318,0.9864,1.3199,4.5206,0.0275,4.4284,0.0416,2.233,6.9639,0.1628,1.0278,7.1488,0.9651,2.0535,1.862,0.8779,6.6901,3.0363,0.1244,0.7082,0.0014,0.4036,0.76

{"prompt":"The United States , which wants to prevent violence spilling over from Syria into Lebanon , will give the Lebanese army $ 120 million more in aid to boost border security and counter-terrorism work ,","text":"The United States, which wants to prevent violence spilling over from Syria into Lebanon, will give the Lebanese army $ 120 million more in aid to boost border security and counter-terrorism work, the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told Congress on Thursday.\n\u201cThis program will greatly enhance the capabilities of the Lebanese National Security Forces, \u201d Panetta said.\nThe US also said that it will provide the Lebanese Army with U.S. surveillance drones for land, air and sea monitoring and that it will enhance cooperation in counterterrorism through training Lebanese intelligence officials.\n\u201cWe are glad to see this program being implemented in Lebanon because those are all steps toward better security in the region, \u201c said Panetta, adding that the increase in aid would create more jobs in Lebanon, which is already struggling with high unemployment.\nLebanon is battling a wave of violence that started when the Syrian armed forces destroyed a Hezbollah militia stronghold in northern Syria in April and has continued despite the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on July 20.\nAt least 90 people have been killed and almost 2,000 others wounded since the violence began. Hezbollah has killed dozens of armed militants in Syria and Lebanon over the past five months, most of whom were foreigners.\n\u201cThe security threats facing Lebanon must be addressed, \u201d Panetta said.\nThe House of Representatives voted unanimously to extend the military aid for two years.\nThe funding has provided help for Lebanese soldiers stationed in northern Syria to fight the Daesh terrorist organization \u2014 another way of writing ISIL \u2014 and to defend the south against the Sunni tribes affiliated with a radical faction of the Shiite Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe House passed the measure along with $ 1 billion for military equipment.\n\u201c As this House and the President have repeatedly said, our policy is to work to improve the security of this country in cooperation with Israel, and our policy has not changed \u201d, Panetta said again.\nPanetta also met with Lebanese foreign minister Gebran Bassil to discuss Syria, the violence and other matters, but he did not say whether they discussed the Hezbollah weapons.\nPanetta\u2019s trip comes after the President\u2019s meeting Thursday morning with Lebanese officials at the White House.\nBoth Panetta and Bassil reaffirmed to Trump that they must work together to support a resolution to Syria\u2019s civil war, which Trump has demanded of his European allies.\nTrump met with Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday \u2014 a day before Panetta\u2019s visit \u2014 on how to address the violence in Syria.\nTillerson said that if the violence does not cease within 30 days, the United States will withdraw its troops.\nBut the Syrian and Lebanese officials were not discussing how to address the violence until the United States has provided the military aid.\n\u201c We expect the US to fulfil its commitments and work with the parties to end the violence, to restore stability and to implement all the agreements reached, \u201d said Bassil to Reuters.\nPanetta\u2019s trip to Lebanon is also part of a wider US mission to the Middle East to help counter the impact of the Syrian crisis.\nAs the violence around Syria has continued to spread through the Middle East, Trump has given greater support to the Syrian Kurds, pushing Turkey to stop attacks in the north.\nThe Trump administration has also been working with Saudi Arabia to deal with an Islamist group known around

{"prompt":"The European Union s executive may trigger a process on Wednesday to begin to strip Poland of its voting rights in the bloc , officials say , as months of tensions between Brussels and Warsaw","text":"The European Union s executive may trigger a process on Wednesday to begin to strip Poland of its voting rights in the bloc, officials say, as months of tensions between Brussels and Warsaw over Poland s anti- EU policies have escalated.\nOfficials say the executive s body, the European Commission, would recommend the suspension of Poland's voting rights at a meeting on Wednesday and the matter would be put to a European Council meeting where it would be taken up as a procedural move only.\nThe commission said it would look into the situation, but gave no further details and made no statement on the suspension itself.\nA Brussels source said the commission would not take a position on whether other members should follow in Luxembourg, where EU leaders meet on Thursday and Friday.\nGermany, France and other leaders have opposed the idea.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told an EU news conference Thursday that the suspension of the Polish vote should be considered with a \" lot of responsibility.\n\" But he acknowledged that the European Commission had said that it was concerned that there were no other options left available to the European Council.\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told reporters Thursday that a suspension could in the future be possible again.\nHe also said no final decision had been made yet, although he gave no details.\nSources said that Poland's voting rights could become suspended if the European Commission concludes that its position on Europe s future will be seriously distorted.\nThe commission would decide whether to make recommendations on the ground that voting rights would be suspended on Thursday after an EU meeting in the Dutch city Antwerp.\nPolish President Andrzej Duda is a member of the anti-EU populist Law and Justice ( PiS ) party, which also controls his parliament and has demanded EU sanctions against the bloc.\nDuda s government has also pushed for the creation of an EU force - the proposed European Security and Defence Pact - that would allow Washington and Europe to cooperate on counterterrorism matters.\nAhead of the Brussels summit, Duda also called on the EU to back a bill backed by the ruling PiS to create a commission that would police democracy in the European country and put its sovereignty in the hands of the country s constitutional court.\nPoland s government, however, has said that it believes Brussels will come to its aid when it comes to defending Poland against the growing anti- EU rhetoric from Duda s party.\nIt also faces criticism coming from the EU over the treatment of a Polish judge who sided with the EU in a ruling on Poland s rights to control EU funds.\nEU leaders will be considering whether to impose new sanctions on Poland after a report from the European anti-graft agency Europol suggests Warsaw's new anti-corruption agency is corrupt.\nEuropol has said that some judges have taken bribes and offered \" undue influence \" to other public officials to gain favour as judges to help the anti-corruption agency.\nDuda s party has said that it wants all judiciary to be under the control of the anti-corruption agency, the Polish Prosecutor-General.\nOpposition parties are also criticizing the PiS government, which has put to rest claims that its anti-constitutional court would try to nullify the ruling of the European Court of Justice.\nThe ruling is expected to stay on the book for another 18 months.\nThe court s verdict was issued in March 2016, before the previous Polish government was ousted by street protests.\nThe PiS - led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki - has accused opposition parties of trying to seize power from the PiS government and is demanding that the EU intervene in the Polish legal system, saying that the EU has done nothing to stop a recent wave of violence in

{"prompt":"Russian President Vladimir Putin , who is running for re-election in March , has proposed writing off some of the tax debts accumulated by Russian individuals and small businesses . A total of about 80","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is running for re-election in March, has proposed writing off some of the tax debts accumulated by Russian individuals and small businesses. A total of about 80 million Russian taxpayers could avoid paying their taxes altogether, in addition to a significant number that can pay part of their taxes off over time.\nOne interesting feature of the proposal is that even though taxpayers must declare their total income, they would only be taxed on what lies above a certain minimum income level.\nThis would be a dramatic departure from the rules in place now; small business owners today are not only required to pay tax on income up until the point at which they would actually go bankrupt, but they are also required to pay taxes even on income from any capital gains from selling property.\nThe proposal was supported by Putin in an interview with Russia's public television channel Dozhd, citing the fact that most Russians who are already living close to or below the poverty level need this type of incentive.\nAt issue is the fact that many Russians live with a relatively low standard of living due to inflation rates as high as the official measure of inflation plus 10 %.\nThere are numerous reasons why this is so. One of the main contributing factors is the weakness of the Russian economy itself, and a lack of investment in infrastructure facilities. In addition, there may have been collusion between many of the higher-level managers of large corporations to inflate share values.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been advocating an overhaul of the tax system for years, and many of his proposals have included the possibility that certain types of workers would be taxed only on wages, not on capital gains. While the proposal has not specifically put forth a tax plan for this type of arrangement, it would appear that it was being promoted by both Putin and the Russian government in hopes of attracting foreign and domestic investment into the Russian economy.\nThe proposed proposal to write off some of the tax due on capital gains is also seen as a part of the larger package of measures aimed at attracting more foreign investment to the Russian economy. The main focus of the reform would be taxing individual income earned from ownership of land and real estate, rather than from wages.\nIt is hoped that this might lead to more foreign and domestic investors willing to purchase real estate in Russia, as well as to additional foreign investment for businesses that have a significant presence in Russia.\nWhile it is yet to be seen what effect such a reform would have on foreign investment in Russia, it could certainly help to attract more investment in Russia, and improve the economy in general.\nThe idea of writing off some of the tax due on capital gains from investing in real estate and related items has also been mentioned by the Russian government as a way to encourage more foreign investment into the Russian market in general, as well as into specific sectors of the economy, such as the real estate sector.\nIn particular, Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that foreigners receive tax breaks or write-offs of investment losses from investing in certain types of real estate, such as hotel real estate. This could potentially help to attract additional foreign investment for the building and renovation of existing hotel real estate, as well as for the expansion of existing hotel properties.\nIn fact, there may be many foreigners who would be interested in considering the possibility of investing in Russia with a view to promoting tourism along the Russian coast, which has a number of attractive attractions for foreign tourists, including the fact that it is a sunny temperate coastal region and is in close proximity to much of the exotic, and often expensive, tourist attractions found on the Mediterranean and Black Sea.\nThe real estate sector in Russia has many benefits for foreign investors who take advantage of the laws in place.

{"prompt":"Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said on Friday that Russia was not ready to sign up to new sanctions on North Korea that would strangle the Asian country economically , the Interfax news agency","text":"Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said on Friday that Russia was not ready to sign up to new sanctions on North Korea that would strangle the Asian country economically, the Interfax news agency reports.\nMorgulov told a business forum on Friday: \u201cI think that imposing harsh sanctions will not be appropriate,\u201d he said, adding that, as the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesman, he would reply on behalf of the Russian government to such questions.\nThe sanctions have been discussed for days and are linked to the nuclear test carried out by North Korea recently.\nThe UN Security Council on Thursday endorsed the draft resolution imposing tough new sanctions on North Korea. North Korea did not take the first step to stop its nuclear weapons development despite threats to the North by President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe draft resolution \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile tests, \u201cexpresses utmost concern to North Korea\u201d and calls for the country to stop its nuclear and missile programs.\nIt also calls on North Korea to hand over its nuclear weapons to the UN and provides a list of more than 100 UN-listed companies banned from supplying goods and materials to North Korea as well as individuals and companies sanctioned for supporting exports of North Korea\u2019s weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technologies.\nThe draft resolution passed by a 15-0 vote with the United States abstaining, despite strong criticism from Washington that it does not go far enough to curb North Korea\u2019s weapons program.\nChina, however, supported the draft resolution on Thursday stating that any attempt to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, including sanctions, must be \u201cappropriate, timely and calibrated\u201d and \u201cwill only serve to cause greater turmoil in the region.\u201d\nChina has taken aggressive measures to defend its allies from the Trump and Kim regime with a series of sanctions against North Korea and Pyongyang.\nDespite the lack of action from North Korea, Washington has refused to acknowledge its possible military option as a viable way to stop the nuclear program and has suggested that the US and its allies need new sanctions. The US has not indicated an immediate action to freeze military assets and resources for North Korea.\nOne of the best things about the holidays is giving. And, sometimes as a result of giving, you can become aware of things that need to be addressed.\nSo, it may be worthwhile to reflect on what you really want and need. If you like shopping and giving, make it a priority to identify what those desires are and what is essential, as you consider various gift options.\nI know how hard it can be to be happy with what we have \u2013 but if you want to give with purpose then you also have to be careful about where you turn your attention.\nMany charities know about issues that arise but are not well-researched. They are just giving their usual items; they simply provide good clothes for the holidays.\nYour giving is not going to change the state of affairs, but you have a role in making it possible for a needy child to have good holidays.\nMake a list of names and then ask questions of friends and co-workers about those names so that you don\u2019t end up giving the same thing twice.\nMake a list of non-traditional gift suggestions and think about others who may not be able to afford the holiday season.\nMake a list of gifts you may buy for yourself. This is a great gift \u2013 you never think about that which you will buy when you can\u2019t actually afford it.\nThere is something wonderful about giving, and you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about what you do for other

It gives me hope and I can really appreciate that it\u2019s here for me.\nI just love how they see me! They see the big picture and they say that my whole life is so important!\nI\u2019ve also learned a lot about my relationship with food and how I need to make changes. I\u2019m ready to make some real progress and I\u2019 can\u2019t tell you how relieved I am. It\u2019s important for me too, because right now I feel like so much of my power and my energy is tied to the food I eat!\nAnd I see God moving in all of this! Maybe you\u2019ve seen him too?? I have this new conviction that I have to work out some things with God!! I can\u2019t get enough of you guys!!!! I can\u2019t wait to hear how God uses this place and the people who work here.\nI\u2019m amazed at how God is in control! I know he\u2019s in control of our lives. We just have to trust him and allow him to do what\u2019s right. I\u2019m loving this feeling!!\nI\u2019m thinking about asking my pastor to start a Bible Study at the church I\u2019m at. I haven\u2019t had anyone do one yet and I\u2019d love to have someone do one!! He thinks that they may be necessary in some churches. I think he\u2019s right, especially here in Texas where we are in such a mess economically. That\u2019s a big reason why I love coming to the local church!

Mehmet Sezer said he has told James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, that Ali Erta\u00e7, one of the people that prosecutors testified that he had briefed about the attack, has not been handed a green card and is not a U.S. citizen. \u201cI would like to say that he is under arrest in Turkey, and we want him,\u201d Mr Sezer said at a news conference in Ankara last Friday. Erta\u00e7, who spoke with Turkish investigators after the September 12, 1999 bombing in Florida, has been identified as an Israeli agent. In New York he said he had talked with an American named Yassir Yassin, who prosecutors said had helped hide assets from the bomber\u2019s group, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. Prosecutors have described Yassin as a \u201cterrorist sympathizer.\u201d (Wall Street Journal, April 2)\nIn Iraq, a court in Baghdad convicted 12 former Iraqis on March 31, 2010, of the death of 21 Israelis. They are accused of masterminding a bombing campaign with a homemade time bomb that killed at least 21 Israeli soldiers in 1991 on the Iraqi border. The U.S. military has said Israel suffered the most loss of its troops in the Gulf War. In June 2003, four men accused of being the masterminds of the campaign were killed in Baghdad. Two of those accused, Mohamed Abdulrahman Taha and Mohamed Tareq Saff, are now serving longer sentences in the U.S. (Reuters, April 2)\nSexual assault allegations have racked the NFL on a regular basis in recent years, with Colin Kaepernick and Chris Chambers both receiving sexual assault charges, and two other players being investigated. The U.S. attorney for the western district of Minnesota, John Chenevert, said he wants prosecutors to move to indict Jaylon Smith and Kevin Byard. \u201cJaylon Smith and Kevin Byard are the two NFL players I have identified as being the main perpetrators of sexual assault crimes,\u201d Chenevert said when asked to elaborate on his remarks about the two players. \u201cThe prosecutors are coming back after the football season and we will make sure that we move forward as quickly as possible to complete our investigations.\u201d (AP, April 2)\nIraq\u2019s government on Wednesday said a United States warplanes attack over Baghdad\u2019s green zone killed four civilians and wounded two others on Thursday. The Pentagon said some of those killed in Thursday\u2019s attack were part of the so-called al-Nusra Front fighting for the Islamic State. \u201cWe condemn this targeted attack and are doing our work to investigate its circumstances,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Colonel Jeff Davis said in a Sunday news conference, with one person he identified being a driver. Pentagon officials said they did not know the specifics of the attack until it happened, and they did not expect any Americans were wounded. (AP, April 2)\nPolice at the French military compound said they had arrested a French soldier accused of torturing at least two Iraqi detainees during an October 2010 mission. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed the arrest Wednesday. The ministry in charge of military matters did not give the name of the soldier. On Thursday, Fabius said he was in talks with French defense officials to determine what action could be taken against the soldier.

{"prompt":"Forensic scientists have identified the remains of 88 Argentine soldiers buried in anonymous graves on the Falkland Islands after the country s 1982 conflict with Britain , the International Committee of the Red Cross (","text":"Forensic scientists have identified the remains of 88 Argentine soldiers buried in anonymous graves on the Falkland Islands after the country s 1982 conflict with Britain, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said, calling for an inquiry into the circumstances of the soldiers death. Argentina and Britain had been at odds since the British annexation of the Falkland Islands after a bloody war that lasted more than six months. The controversy has left some Argentinians claiming that their country s government used torture techniques and kept bodies secret to cover up what could have been massive violations of human rights. Argentina is one of the most active countries in trying to bring war crime suspects to justice, a mission the country has taken as a personal crusade, supported the ICRC in its call for the case be investigated. Some of the soldiers were not identified immediately due to their injuries and deteriorating state of preservation. Of the 88 identified by Forensic Sciences in Southampton, three had been cremated. The other 85 were buried with no names and there were no personal identifying tattoos that could have pointed the way to where they came from, said ICRC Executive Secretary Anthony Bellanger. Bellanger was talking in London, where the ICRC is holding hearings into Argentina s war crimes. Argentina has been fighting for more than three decades for justice for the missing soldiers under international laws that it says were violated. Bellanger said on Wednesday. Some of the military chiefs who were involved in torturing the prisoners s bodyguards were now serving the army at war in the Falkland Islands, which Argentina captured after the conflict in January 1982. Investigators there believe the corpses of 22 dead men were disposed of in trenches. Another 27 were buried in secret, with their bodies covered by plastic and some with their faces mutilated. Bellanger said the victims were transported to the Falkland Islands from Diego Garcia and were tortured. Bellanger told IRI television that an investigation would help to identify the men who died there. Most bodies have been exhumed. They don t want another conflict, he said. The investigation into the deaths is an historic landmark in the long-running litigation in the international law courts to seek compensation for the war prisoners s families and for other victims. Argentina s government is trying to persuade Britain to recognize its claims to the islands, including the right to a court of its own. Argentina has also been pursuing claims for damages in various international courts, both in the Western Hemisphere, where Argentina lost the war, and in Europe. Some of the families say the killings were committed by soldiers of Argentina s military intelligence service, known as the Servicio de Informacion de la Fuerza Area (Sida), which is no longer operating. Argentina took legal action to end British control over the islands in 1984 when Britain was considering moving troops from them. Britain now considers the islands an overseas dependency. The U.K. is a party to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (and to its Optional Protocol on civil and political rights). There has been no inquiry on Argentina s past human rights violations. The United States has joined Argentine efforts to demand that it does accept a commission of inquiry from the United Nations, although the U.S. ambassador to Washington said on Sunday that his country is against the commission being created. The International Court of Justice declared after the Second World War that it could decide war crimes committed by Argentina s military in the archipelago, despite calls from other countries to use the tribunal and despite opposition from Argentina. The court s ruling said that the victims should be compensated according to the law of nations.

The demonstration was by far the","text":"About 20,000 Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv on Saturday against government corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. The demonstration was by far the largest in the city\u2019s history \u2014 although the size of such protests in Israel are often much smaller due to Israel\u2019s strict media censorship laws. But this time, many of the same leaders who call for public demonstrations to condemn Israel\u2019s oppression and for change the Israeli government to have a seat at the table to solve the Palestinian conflict had also joined the demonstrations. Most of the people who were there were protesting against corruption, but also against Netanyahu\u2019s recent call to bring in the army to protect people in the West Bank \u2013 the most oppressed part of the country \u2014 and to kill the Palestinian protesters.\nThere is no doubt the Israelis who took to the streets are angry with their government. When asked what they thought the Prime Minister should do in response to the protests, the vast majority said that they were opposed to his calls for the army on the streets and that they were also opposed to the \u201cthreat of violence\u201d against Palestinian demonstrators.\nThe protest was organized by an activist group called \u201cChildren of the Nakba\u201d and was led by the left-of-centre Movement for a Better Israel. It was attended by a large number of students, many of whom had been sitting in the classroom for hours to avoid being sent home \u2014 and in some cases, several days without going home \u2014 in the run-up to the protests. The march ended at Tel Aviv\u2019s university university campus, as the majority of the demonstrators were students. Some of the crowd were wearing yellow, a colour associated with Palestinian resistance and the demonstrations. A few chanted slogans in Arabic against Israel, the Israeli army, and the occupation. Other chants were in Hebrew, including an Israeli slogan that they considered anti-Semitic, which reads: \u201cI don\u2019t like the Jews\u201d.\nThe number of protesters was estimated at about 20,000. Some organizers said it even reached 100,000, but official figures by the police were 10,000.\nAlthough the protest was not organized by any of the major political parties or organizations in the country, some of the most prominent politicians in both the Israeli political left and the right are also present among the ranks of the demonstrators. There were Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas leader Sheikh Ismail Haniyeh, deputy chairman of Likud\u2019s left-wing faction and the country\u2019s most prominent labor leader, Isaac Herzog, leader of the Kulanu party, and several other prominent members of the Israeli ruling coalition, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabi Ashkenazi, Labor Minister Amir Peretz, Defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon, the current head of the security cabinet, Dan Zoabi, and former Knesset member, Haim Ramon. Among the leading Israeli members of parliament who took part in the demonstrations, not a single one of them was associated with any of the political parties or organizations that hold the bulk of the parliamentary seats. \u201cPoliticians are also human beings, and everyone makes mistakes. Many of them are being sued for corruption, and if they are not sued, they are having a good time with public funds. They live well and are not responsible for people\u2019s misery and suffering,\u201d said one protester.\nThere is a great deal of oppression in Israel, in terms of poverty, lack of health care and housing, and low wages. But there is no doubt that the protesters were also angry that the current government refused to accept a fair solution to the Palestinian conflict that would include their return to their homes and lands.","token_len":763,"entropy":[6.6065,2.5118,0.0702,6.7594,8.4944,1.0308,1.9294,0.0022,1.3677,1.8311,3.1089,6.7033,5.7529,1.2658,8.1425,0.0049,0.0443,0.0004,6.3373,2.2338,4.0353,4.6821,0.1339,2.5306,2.7986,0.4629,4.1652,0.9826,3.708,0.5549,2.9737,1.2533,1.0859,7.4326,0.61,0.14,0.2087,1.6109,1.3688,3.0941,16.5243,6.8669,6.3809,0.706,6.8635,5.9689,1.9793,5.4211,0.3463,5.2801,2.3619,3.4851,1.987,5.2423,3.3961,3.7937,0.7988,6.5218,0.0052,5.3078,11.8142,0.1408,0.0307,5.2919,6.0396,1.6327,3.2586,0.3379,5.8356,4.0814,3.68,1.5427,4.0092,2.1714,0.4599,6.3067,4.9326,2.3868,5.9156,0.6797,5.437,3.3089,4.7859,4.8737,2.4314,3.5293,0.0052,0.0288,6.562,2.3813,4.5331,6.0401,7.3092,3.7927,0.5678,3.4977,6.0149,1.8907,4.9636,0.0319,0.0481,0.0905,5.3841,5.6001,0.9093,3.0415,3.9184,4.6587,3.1144,3.2932,1.2078,2.839,0.6026,6.0598,0.693,0.3917,3.567,1.5194,2.9628,2.2294,1.1856,4.1682,1.1238,3.4917,1.2536,2.0408,3.527,0.6645,3.0777,2.9502,0.0025,0.0017,4.6634,6.042,1.4553,4.5468,2.3207,1.6578,3.8383,0.8615,4.0776,5.7541,2.8029,1.4101,1.9017,0.0002,8.1304,2.9023,3.8687,8.1083,2.3341,0.0137,0.2029,1.6691,2.9468,1.0656,4.1795,7.0457,2.0642,2.2614,5.1474,1.0232,0.9769,10.7203,2.8161,1.5321,1.5947,3.6766,4.5412,3.0278,2.96,2.8503,0.0776,0.0275,3.9492,4.4051,2.3822,2.6227,0.6119,1.2877,5.5141,3.228,2.7355,0.6884,2.1374,2.9792,4.024,0.0028,0.8959,0.1441,3.1951,1.3935,0.364,0.6969,1.4506,0.309,2.181,5.8014,0.0057,1.9523,1.9055,1.7922,2.1112,4.7703,0.0806,3.5005,6.1483,0.654,1.9149,0.9823,7.6513,0.9917,5.2883,2.4251,2.1615,1.3634,1.4334,3.7935,1.0065,0.0329,1.1018,15.3094,5.5584,8.3369,0.8654,2.0693,0.8508,10.9068,3.1148,2.7225,2.2992,0.5145,1.3829,1.9065,3.5912,1.561,1.2857,0.324,4.3495,3.2687,0.4676,0.4308,6.0525,1.3574,8.4246,0.8218,1.372,8.7925,0.0089,0.3162,1.8495,1.662,2.3294,2.4742,0.0234,2.2729,6.3626,0.3661,4.414,0.0138,3.9968,0.2081,5.8158,0.2013,2.8803,3.8903,0.5596,1.384,2.4622,1.1907,3.5099,0.0696,2.92,1.6878,0.3239,0.016,4.1129,1.3119,2.8939,0.239,0.5068,2.6981,1.7755,6.2081,0.9532,0.9843,6.1047,1.789,1.9951,3.6785,5.9257,1.9308,5.649,2.0768,6.8048,1.9998,4.466,1.2269,0.0969,1.394,6.7454,5.3597,6.5631,4.6574,1.9182,3.3147,3.547,2.4254,6.2826,0.3429,0.0028,0.0091,0.2683,2.4723,0.1798,1.8337,4.2295,3.5261,1.6796,4.83,0.0766,9.2118,0.1562,0.0489,6.5617,5.5453,2.4993,1.1692,4.9453,2.3003,5.7544,0.1082,1.0733,1.5903,1.8725,3.6713,1.2531,3.9483,1.3093,0.3786,6.3494,2.2826,2.6701,4.2964,2.7086,4.1107,4.7657,3.4653,0.015,4.009,3.2454,2.8264,2.4439,5.7328,5.3346,3.7629,1.8497,4.4885,1.5859,3.825,1.5737,6.029,2.8417,1.5202,3.5108,3.3668,3.2992,1.2292,0.5407,0.8206,2.4277,0.8267,4.8024,4.0749,1.1142,4.0057,1.8503,1.272,2.7888,5.7656,4.0924,4.8537,1.3391,5.1342,4.89,4.5438,0.022,0.534,2.0042,3.0457,6.0166,1.0207,4.4514,1.9217,3.4799,3.5379,4.2798,3.5063,0.1194,3.506,1.771,5.3099,1.1447,1.8515,1.7722,1.0657,1.497,5.833,0.0555,1.8744,1.9064,4.5399,0.3796,2.545,2.4968,0.0277,0.0064,1.1888,3.4236,5.8573,1.9388,3.7124,7.9871,2.3166,2.987,0.1238,0.248,2.1976,1.6828,7.0176,0.6116,5.6883,0.7811,4.3621,2.9421,5.6324,0.1083,0.0448,0.7688,1.5791,5.1938,1.0193,2.2287,0.7575,3.0217,1.4885,0.4899,2.1379,2.0809,0.0687,3.5176,1.5805,0.1587,2.4896,2.5875,2.6524,0.6758,0.6581,0.2139,3.4496,1.0421,0.3754,4.051,0.5925,2.9566,1.5898,5.4411,1.1186,2.0693,4.3646,5.2428,0.0514,0.4878,1.2221,3.0873,2.5716,3.9812,6.5182,0.1883,8.6292,0.1807,0.6203,1.7622,0.2753,4.3941,1.1726,7.3731,6.0961,1.1249,0.1253,0.0008,0.9353,5.0743,1.3314,5.3787,5.0531,0.0084,0.0357,0.0047,0.1018,0.0007,0.1031,7.5016,4.5464,0.176,6.9966,0.0011,0.0,6.0763,4.2948,0.2527,6.0949,0.4073,0.4481,3.999,3.1644,2.6213,5.5526,2.2708,0.0932,0.0389,2.252,1.6031,7.0729,1.0032,0.7792,5.3179,0.0222,0.0115,0.9727,5.7067,0.0155,0.2622,9.8097,0.0023,0.6431,0.9981,0.6644,3.9458,1.1679,1.0387,3.1659,0.0686,0.2351,2.9235,3.281,1.2023,1.8522,1.5751,5.6869,0.2017,2.134,0.0015,8.8335,0.2786,3.7914,0.6076,0.019,1.025,5.2844,1.8164,8.0902,4.481,0.0307,0.2555,4.6823,0.0243,1.4354,0.0001,0.0317,18.7072,3.2481,6.8675,0.1968,3.1914,4.9115,2.8875,0.0007,0.3194,4.7961,1.2532,0.6189,8.1833,12.1126,2.568,0.2902,0.7784,2.9646,6.1319,0.0114,0.0,0.4455,2.8322,4.9428,0.3693,10.2922,3.0911,1.1955,4.7031,0.7264,4.0466,3.2676,5.7008,0.1428,3.5816,4.03,3.7799,0.0389,0.5546,0.1093,3.2373,2.5334,6.1825,2.8288,0.0494,2.3003,1.4324,0.2841,1.1728,6.0818,0.016,2.484,1.1692,0.2432,2.194,0.0556,1.0729,0.5573,2.0814,5.7998,2.3728,7.6721,0.0109,0.7535,4.2801,0.6267,1.1871,6.7908,0.2562,8.197,0.572,3.0059,2.5897,9.314,0.9363,1.2604,1.1573,6.6779,6.0431,0.4899,0.9418,4.512,0.6155,0.9779,1.7456,5.8231,6.137,1.456,4.5258,1.3874,1.708,4.8765,1.0127,1.4251,2.0991,4.8308,0.835,0.7962,0.9582,6.6775,3.083,4.8534,0.3311,4.2062,6.1132,6.4503,0.7318,3.7038,5.668,5.545,1.8519,2.1791,2.3965,7.4363,0.0526,5.4659,3.2888,0.1852,0.0884,6.6553,2.2183,2.048,2.1174,6.0896,6.1992,5.0319,3.2527,2.7199,0.603,0.5147,3.7875,2.3503,1.618,4.4023,0.5374,0.1774,7.1358,1.1355,1.9145,1.0906,4.7,4.0163,0.0043,6.1071,0.4636,4.9939,0.0021,2.7911,0.2368,1.7632,4.5424,0.468

{"prompt":"A former Korean Air Lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on Thursday when South Korea s Supreme Court upheld","text":"A former Korean Air Lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on Thursday when South Korea s Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision banning her from flying for 12 years.\nHiroko Kim appealed against a two-and-a-half-year sentence last year but the Supreme Court allowed her to keep her passports. The ruling allows for Kim to apply for a one-year temporary pardon. After that, she has until March to start a new flight company, be licensed as a pilot and undergo training in air safety.\nA court found that Kim was drunk at the time on her flight from Seoul to Gwangju, the southern province home to an international airport.\nShe had just left a Korean party and insisted on snacking. Her boyfriend, Kim Hyung-su, asked her to sit down and wait.\nAfter two hours, Kim Hyung-su ordered kimnips and peanut butter cookies thinking he was paying for them for the entire flight. Kim told a flight attendant that she wanted those items and, as Kim Hyung-su continued to argue, pushed him down the aisle, according to the court. Kim took her seat, not eating the snacks. She was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent.\nKim Hyung-su told the court that he left Kim Kim and, while she was sitting down again, began calling her a liar and yelling, according to the court. Kim Kim was escorted off the plane and Kim Hyung-su was charged with drunkenness and battery. A court last year found that Kim Kim was guilty of drunkenness and battery and that she had been on medication for depression.\nKim Kim appealed against the ruling and, this week, s Supreme Court agreed that her two and a half year prison sentence was too lenient. A maximum fine for being drunk on a plane in South Korea is about two million won, or $2225.\nKim Kim says she suffered from insomnia after her flight to Gwangju. She suffered from insomnia after her flight to Gwangju, the southern province home to an international airport\nShe suffered from insomnia after she traveled because the trip was too long and she could not sleep, says the court.\nKim Kim told the court she suffered from paranoia when she traveled through the United States on Korean Air flights last year.\nShe said she was told that, prior to their departure, the crew had instructed the passengers to clean the plane before they arrived in the United States, but they did not. Kim said the crew asked her if she was the one that called them, and she said, yes.\n\u201cI can confirm that I heard the crew say \u2018you must have done something wrong by disturbing the cleanliness of the plane.'\u201d\nThe judge had sentenced Kim to two to three years in jail, while prosecutors said the defendant should have been kept in prison for over ten years.\nA second defendant in the case, Kim Hyeong-su, a Korean Air employee, was sentenced to one year in prison for allowing the passenger to push another man.\nKim, in January 2013, was seen dragging a man to the bathroom after a man threw peanut butter all over the seat. This triggered a fight between the two men.\nIn both cases, the court held that the air travel restrictions were reasonable considering the seriousness of the charges and the defendant\u2019s own actions.\nThe prosecutors said the court s decision is a departure from its own precedent that would allow an airline employee to continue working with a passenger, if the case does not involve a criminal matter. South Korea\u2019s airlines routinely suspend employees for drunk driving, threatening violence and other misconduct.","token_len":763,"entropy":[7.9648,9.6407,3.7088,4.9852,2.0984,1.8542,4.7778,3.6448,3.8509,7.6594,3.5446,5.1547,5.2061,5.0376,1.6512,7.1957,2.7062,0.9356,6.3694,11.2505,2.8276,9.2836,0.4177,10.511,2.1034,4.4797,3.1184,3.8941,8.1977,0.8887,8.6007,13.8102,0.0516,2.8713,1.4537,2.554,0.1473,2.8111,4.6809,0.8063,0.0828,0.5735,3.0583,4.4109,1.5309,0.368,0.2528,17.0768,4.3515,2.8606,3.5315,9.913,2.7484,2.3003,4.8867,0.0158,5.1888,0.0045,0.0281,0.0028,0.0012,0.3032,0.1608,2.2745,5.6116,1.1641,4.5002,1.2389,1.64,0.0175,5.0702,0.4573,0.2568,3.8215,1.9117,7.8941,2.0,2.95,2.4308,4.5855,3.7878,6.0469,0.2286,4.9365,0.2023,0.9817,5.3154,0.0566,0.138,4.1646,7.1793,2.3142,6.0881,2.9751,0.3306,0.4349,3.7306,2.1383,2.7228,2.2096,5.2003,2.5201,0.9085,2.556,8.2755,1.6258,7.2442,4.0844,2.6939,0.2789,1.2589,0.5163,3.7605,2.8932,2.4543,4.2821,1.2957,0.5193,0.2586,5.8243,4.345,5.0907,1.3017,1.1722,2.1367,7.33,2.3935,0.2213,0.0277,6.5375,3.4302,1.5603,2.0654,1.6588,0.135,5.9591,0.012,0.0129,1.2332,2.428,3.0046,3.878,6.499,0.2033,4.5111,3.8241,0.381,0.8693,1.2609,3.135,2.3891,4.6926,3.2184,2.368,4.9933,9.0135,2.0593,8.254,1.318,8.8852,1.2498,3.4018,3.2053,4.2014,1.3982,2.7789,2.6778,2.5025,0.6528,4.0989,3.2509,4.0367,0.4061,0.5431,3.7977,1.8451,1.6603,4.5584,2.2062,1.5271,3.549,3.9379,0.8699,0.6349,0.6833,3.1388,0.0073,0.0377,0.0505,4.2324,9.9236,2.3018,6.8399,6.6765,1.9931,7.0793,0.2497,4.7951,13.0388,2.7907,0.7665,5.077,1.0049,2.6335,5.4928,2.3502,4.8443,1.2717,0.3849,2.2748,5.3179,4.8093,4.0818,0.0257,1.5696,0.7972,3.0281,7.2709,4.7731,2.5684,4.8895,2.8573,3.4428,0.3808,0.0023,0.0017,0.0022,5.459,0.8301,5.1039,0.8056,5.7515,0.7354,2.7691,1.1973,0.4624,2.4895,4.4674,0.0018,1.4283,0.7861,0.8289,2.2521,5.8324,2.9983,1.8558,2.0872,5.9329,6.6041,2.8183,4.3566,1.4009,3.0884,2.0551,5.4487,1.3392,0.6606,2.2984,2.9209,0.0842,1.1421,0.4898,1.0853,0.0013,5.7752,1.5596,0.838,0.2944,1.6667,0.214,0.0065,0.0029,0.0037,2.9605,1.0502,0.3826,0.7214,2.1849,5.164,3.5187,5.4393,3.3669,6.0691,3.9083,1.2656,0.9217,3.0833,1.9183,5.2099,0.1492,4.6401,5.6229,0.8491,2.5504,3.6072,1.3938,7.0459,2.5353,2.1642,0.0032,0.7192,0.1356,0.2302,1.7106,6.8685,2.9964,4.7498,2.5062,0.2448,0.4174,1.4787,5.7092,0.0157,0.0039,0.0095,0.0018,1.7275,3.5842,0.113,4.0465,2.9515,1.414,3.8811,0.8672,4.3866,2.8345,6.8471,1.3907,1.4084,1.0852,0.4559,4.5549,1.0203,3.3575,0.2526,4.0481,0.3465,0.7812,0.1167,1.842,3.1855,0.9409,1.8281,2.0189,4.2903,4.6805,0.9168,3.1937,1.1812,0.4258,1.6601,4.7402,5.4889,2.5722,0.2524,1.2899,1.2819,3.0449,4.5912,1.5629,0.1164,8.8614,7.1062,0.0237,6.2677,2.9805,1.9133,5.1237,5.9794,0.0931,0.0091,2.0257,3.2421,0.1753,1.1756,1.615,1.0064,0.0009,0.628,4.0264,7.045,4.0226,4.083,5.5433,0.9754,1.4614,1.3097,2.3534,3.9536,2.7957,0.0161,0.8608,4.5265,4.5852,2.2765,0.053,2.4819,2.0449,1.6232,4.9377,8.2969,0.731,0.9699,1.9379,2.3961,4.8854,0.4275,5.1792,1.4134,5.2991,3.4142,1.9347,0.577,3.1736,0.7567,0.0005,0.0012,1.0554,2.1987,5.615,0.4194,3.5414,1.5012,0.7036,0.0932,0.292,1.688,0.0004,0.0007,2.6716,0.8609,0.0922,0.001,0.0181,0.0014,0.0065,0.0165,0.0029,4.8178,2.9531,5.3152,0.1801,1.0945,0.6433,2.7662,6.9977,7.6819,3.5665,5.6264,0.9294,2.4515,1.2964,1.1352,1.1676,3.3336,0.1831,1.9849,2.6547,4.997,2.3613,1.3542,0.5149,0.9305,1.8778,1.2254,3.8447,0.755,0.0691,1.4226,4.1125,0.0258,6.6152,3.8355,0.209,4.1537,5.2688,1.4153,4.4978,0.0272,3.3723,5.0216,1.8293,3.702,3.7974,0.4164,0.7823,1.1267,1.4313,1.4283,0.538,1.6526,3.7555,1.8942,4.547,6.091,0.0026,4.9784,2.4402,0.408,2.3087,3.5205,2.2589,4.9297,2.9281,2.3215,0.2856,6.3503,2.1636,2.3793,2.8293,2.0402,3.879,1.5298,1.1182,0.5376,0.0037,1.6136,2.2037,2.8272,1.9011,0.0801,0.8722,2.4502,2.5486,2.4948,1.3424,4.6012,0.4048,2.1855,0.1652,1.6166,5.362,2.2235,2.5921,6.0356,3.5127,2.0777,1.4073,0.4502,0.4939,2.5652,4.6286,0.6321,0.5873,11.6142,8.0763,8.0066,3.7551,4.7153,0.4823,1.875,6.4839,1.6669,2.3442,2.3595,9.5309,8.3213,5.4636,3.4734,2.5792,3.4542,1.9144,0.8999,6.0415,10.495,0.8306,7.6873,1.2709,0.481,0.3463,0.6317,6.7483,4.1897,7.3386,0.9197,2.2461,3.4798,4.8132,3.7746,0.3322,2.2423,2.3847,4.4011,1.7253,0.1276,0.635,1.3343,1.5891,3.8876,5.4056,2.5073,2.1636,6.4635,3.5776,1.397,0.9748,5.9395,1.6017,2.1083,1.0312,6.0836,4.5206,0.0713,0.5019,0.6341,3.519,4.2637,2.968,3.1005,0.202,0.1228,0.3432,2.5092,4.1885,0.7903,2.3234,0.0941,2.8006,0.0998,3.3917,2.8527,0.7553,3.7426,0.7776,0.9371,1.2226,0.1768,3.073,0.2816,0.5984,0.955,2.2336,8.1737,2.776,3.8739,0.2328,6.1398,5.4431,2.6682,4.4787,0.8775,2.0325,4.4109,5.1984,6.2553,3.3672,0.0615,1.4544,4.4113,6.8326,0.9671,1.9838,2.7929,0.73,2.9622,2.1488,2.2323,4.5992,4.4389,6.5273,0.0464,7.7091,0.0398,1.6834,3.6378,1.0514,6.1248,6.1599,0.7876,2.0455,1.7744,0.5334,1.0946,0.7424,1.4912,0.9431,2.9284,6.8959,0.1063,0.105,0.915,2.1928,4.3404,0.3079,1.2861,6.606,5.0852,5.9315,1.1346,3.8803,7.5104,0.6442,3.5803,0.0289,0.1745,3.3693,1.5828,1.3499,2.7141,14.0841,7.615,2.8799,4.1941,2.4387,0.8012,0.427,1.9836,6.8669,1.3142,1.6247,3.3753,9.0379,2.3157,3.6838,2.1365,6.1002,0.1378,3.2654,

{"prompt":"U.S. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said on Monday he would vote against a Republican tax bill in the Budget Committee on Tuesday unless his concerns about the legislation are resolved , according to his office","text":"U.S. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said on Monday he would vote against a Republican tax bill in the Budget Committee on Tuesday unless his concerns about the legislation are resolved, according to his office.\nThe two bills, on Capitol Hill to raise revenues for the federal government, require a divided Congress and an uneasy Republican majority. There is no plan to pass the measure by a simple vote.\nThe two tax issues are the highest-priority issues that Republicans want to resolve in the budget negotiations with Democrats and the White House, Johnson said. Both of them are tied to a question of sovereignty: What is the role of Congress in determining whether the IRS collects taxes, which lawmakers call \u201cexecutive action\u201d in the Constitution?\nJohnson and other lawmakers are demanding that there be a provision that prohibits President Donald Trump from signing off on tax changes that Congress doesn\u2019t approve.\n\u201cWhen we pass a bill, I want the President to be able to sign it,\u201d Johnson told reporters in the U.S. Capitol. \u201cBut with the things we are looking at right now, it doesn\u2019t seem like it is going to happen unless we end up getting the IRS under some sort of congressional control.\u201d\nSenators from both parties have demanded that Trump sign off on at least two tax changes that they say affect the business of Amazon, which has argued that its taxes are set in line with similar businesses. The company made a $5 billion investment in Washington in 2019. \u201cThis tax relief, for Amazon and other companies, would encourage them to keep their jobs and investments in the United States,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said. He said both Johnson and Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) would not support the two tax measures unless Trump signed off.\nJohnson said he sees the tax measure as an \u201cabsolute no-go.\u201d The IRS does need the lawmakers\u2019 permission to get into bank accounts to take income or capital gains tax payments.\nThe IRS has sought to raise a whopping $833 billion by 2023 to fund Social Security, Medicaid, the Veterans\u2019 Administration and other programs, according to figures from tax professionals. The IRS will also need to raise another almost $300 billion to address a shortfall in pension and worker benefits. In a speech to business leaders earlier this year, Trump said he would support giving the IRS a new $300 billion in taxes to address the shortfall, but he\u2019s been clear about his opposition to allowing the IRS to access taxpayers\u2019 bank accounts.\n\u201cThe idea that one Congress controls the IRS\u2026 I personally would say, it\u2019s probably the single most horrifying proposition in the entire Constitution,\u201d Johnson said Monday.\nThe president's proposed budget for 2019 would reduce the IRS budget by more than a third. Trump would also ask Congress to authorize a $300 billion increase to the IRS, according to a White House document. The president has been opposed to the IRS\u2019s ability to access taxpayers\u2019 bank accounts, but has also opposed Congress passing a law giving the organization more control.\nGov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, on Monday requested tougher language. If you don\u2019t have to sign the IRS over to them, it\u2019s not going to happen! It\u2019s an easy thing to say but in the current political environment with GOP controlled Congress, it becomes extremely difficult.\n\u201cTrump has said that there will be no executive action on tax issues, and he has not indicated to that end.

There is no such thing as a small price to pay for a better deal.\"\nThe British Government has vowed to negotiate a divorce agreement that will be a key test of May\u2019s leadership. PHOTO: REUTERS\nAhead of the summit on Saturday, the EU has repeatedly warned of the risk of no deal.

{"prompt":"Longtime U.S. congressman from Georgia John Lewis , who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s , said on Thursday that he would not attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum","text":"Longtime U.S. congressman from Georgia John Lewis, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, said on Thursday that he would not attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum because of the controversy over its design. Lewis, a former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, is in a state whose history is still being written, according to this CNN video. But he did say he hoped for a better museum. Lewis, a civil rights pioneer, gave a speech last week at the event, saying that he had \" to step back a little \" because he didn't think history was written there. \"We need to make sure that we give people who fought and died for that freedom, not only in Mississippi, but in the United States and in the world, the recognition that they deserved,\" he said. John Lewis is the only former chair of the House Judiciary Committee in America to not attend the opening day of the museum's museum. \" We are in a country where it happened, \" I wrote on my web site. \"I do hope that the message of the museum is not lost and that the people around the world learn from it and that it gets a lot more people to know the history of the Civil Rights Movement instead of just knowing the names, their numbers but not very much else. \"\nThe Department of Health and Human Services issued a report on Thursday saying the number of Americans affected with the Spanish flu this year is projected to reach 30 million, more than double the previous year's 8 million. The death toll attributed to Spanish flu, known as H1N1, continues to climb. The report said this week that about 500 of the more than 3,800 hospitalized patients were under the age of 5, and more than 4,000 have lost their lives. According to the Health and Human Resources Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, at least 30 million people have been infected and 7 million are hospitalized. \" It is important to realize that there is an ongoing epidemic, that the number of people dying from it is increasing and that we haven't seen the death toll reduce dramatically, \" she said Thursday. The nationwide number of cases of H1N1 is projected to reach 3 million in the coming days and that number is likely to grow. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are predicting a rise in cases and death tolls in the coming months, said the report released by HHS. On Thursday, the CDC issued a bulletin that warned that the current number of cases of flu in the U.S. could reach 10 million per week or 2 million per day in July.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor has released a report saying that the federal minimum wage could raise the monthly cost of living by roughly 0.4 percent for an 18-month period beginning in 2012. In 2010, the Federal Labor Standards Act was changed to raise the federal minimum wage to 6. 50 per hour. On Thursday, the agency released a report that says the increase would raise the cost of goods and services by 3.6 percent in the first year of the legislation, but that by 2022, it could cut into consumer spending at a more modest rate. The report says that those affected would largely have to pay for higher prices for groceries and other products. \" Because the price impact of an incremental increase in the FLSA minimum wage rises and falls over time, the impact also varies with price elasticities of demand for consumption goods and services, \" said the report.

{"prompt":"Brazil s most wanted arms trafficker , an alleged weapons supplier for Rio de Janeiro s biggest criminal gang the Red Command ( CV ) , was captured in southern Paraguay on Wednesday , Rio","text":"Brazil s most wanted arms trafficker, an alleged weapons supplier for Rio de Janeiro s biggest criminal gang the Red Command ( CV ), was captured in southern Paraguay on Wednesday, Rio TV reported.\nThe man in a photo wearing a pink coat of arms, green boots, black gloves and a black backpack reportedly appeared at a police station in the southern city of Assu on Wednesday.\nHe was taken to the Federal Police headquarters in the nearby town of Natal where interrogation began.\nHe was known as Ricardo Augusto Pereira de Melo Alves, said the network.\nThe man was wanted on a criminal order issued in March on weapons and explosives smuggling - allegations for which Brazilians have been jailed for in the southern province of Rio Grande do Norte.\nRicardo Alves is also accused of being an international arms trafficker.\nIn addition to drugs, he is suspected of having supplied the Red Command with firearms, R7 reported.\nThe network said the suspect was arrested by Paraguay Police on Wednesday after attempting to board the Brazilian ferry boat.\nThey said the man had come through the Paraguayan borders of Corumb\u00e1 and Uruguaiana and had used a fake passport.\nThe man is one of Brazil s most wanted men and is accused of supplying arms to the criminal groups that target the police and civil servants.\nHe is also suspected of being a Brazilian accomplice in the murder of an anti-crime prosecutor.\nIt s reported the drugs trafficker was arrested in May of last year.\nIn October 2014 he was arrested in Paraguay after allegedly trying to bring cocaine worth up to US$4 million into Brazil.\nHe is considered one of the most wanted criminals in the Rio Grande do Norte state - who would have spent R$700 million ( US$400 million ) on guns, ammunition, ammunition, explosives, drug precursors, money for smuggling, and cell phones.\nOn the other hand, according to Brazil s anti-narcotics police, during the year alone ( 2014 ) there had been a drop in the seizures of illicit drugs.\nHowever, the Brazilian police have indicated that drug trafficking activities should increase in the forthcoming period.\nThe report said that in the last five months over 1.500 people had been arrested for drug trafficking.\nThe latest of the arrests were made on Wednesday after the police captured 14 people believed to be the main drug cartel in the country.\nThe criminal group who made it into a Brazilian cell phone used the name of the most wanted man Ricardo Alves.\nThe police discovered the illicit traffic when they arrested the suspects in the south of Brazil.\nAccording to an official of a federal police, the man carried weapons and ammunition to the main headquarters of a Brazilian crime cartel.\nOfficials said that Ricardo Alves would send small amounts of cash or goods to a police station to obtain the authorization to transport the money or drugs from the South to the capital ( Brasilia ).\nThere are indications that the alleged arms trafficker was killed by the Red Command to prevent it from giving information to the police on the trafficking routes.\nThe Red Command is one of the largest organized crime groups, which would have kidnapped, assassinated, tortured, forced victims to perform labor, and sold drugs around Rio de Janeiro's urban areas, the capital, along major highways, railways and the sea

{"prompt":"Hundreds of government employees file in and out of the U.S. agency for auto safety in Washington every working day , investigating potentially dangerous vehicles and managing a $ 900 million annual budget . But","text":"Hundreds of government employees file in and out of the U.S. agency for auto safety in Washington every working day, investigating potentially dangerous vehicles and managing a $ 900 million annual budget. But that does not ensure a smooth life. The office in the middle of the capital was under fire on Wednesday for alleged malfeasance. A whistleblower has accused it of not only destroying files of vehicles, but also not reporting certain flaws and providing false information to the U.S. Department of Transportation and other government agencies.\nThe whistleblower, known only as L.U.S.O.L. The name has been revealed by the New York Times, claims to have filed dozens of complaints against this office, calling it a \u201csecretive and ruthless tool of the Department of Transportation.\u201d Complaints have been lodged against the employees at this location over the years, but none of them have been resolved.\nThere is no guarantee that such complaints will be resolved by the authorities. In the future, the whistleblower is planning to file a new complaint with the FBI. She is afraid that L.U.S.O.L. The staff have been working with the intention of destroying the files \u2013 especially in recent years.\nIn addition to the failure to respond to complaints, the whistleblower claims that the employees of this office have been fabricating defects of vehicles and that there is evidence of collusion between this office and the American automobile manufacturers. The whistleblower also claims to be aware of a list of vehicles that she thinks should have been removed from the road. It has, however, not been disclosed why they should have been removed.\nThe whistleblower does not stop there. She also claims to have been promised a great deal more office money. This fact, together with the complaints filed, does not help the situation with the office in Washington. \u201cSome of this behavior has been rampant, which is simply unacceptable,\u201d says the president of the National Association of Automotive Inspection Service Technologists, Daniel Nardello. It has, however, added that there is no reason to believe that all complaints were justified.\nThe Department of Transportation is currently conducting an investigation into the complaints that were lodged against this office. Officials in this office have, however, declined to comment on the circumstances.\nNardello believes that there is currently a lot of speculation about the whistleblower L.U.S.O.L. The office. He does not understand why any of them continue to work there. The whistleblower even says that all her complaints against the office have been ignored and that nothing was done.\nThe complaints against L.U.S.O.L. The office are already being discussed as the most serious problem in the government. On Wednesday, two top congressman were also present in the Washington agency \u2013 Republican John Shimkus and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Shimkus spoke of the whistleblower L.U.S.O.L. \u201cWe should absolutely stop the bad actors who are destroying and destroying our government and our country.\u201d\nThere is, however, a very serious question about the authenticity of the whistleblower L.U.S.O.L. The office has been discussed since it recently came to light that some of this news was a fake.\nThere is also concern that this office can be used for spying on its employees. They have, however, confirmed that no spyware is used on a daily basis.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, the Washington agency, is currently being investigated by U.S. media. It is being accused of destroying the records of the cars. The agency also reported to the National Transportation Safety Board.

{"prompt":"Three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday when Kurdish demonstrators joined a second day of protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries amid tensions between their region and","text":"Three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday when Kurdish demonstrators joined a second day of protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries amid tensions between their region and Turkish authorities.\nThe deaths were among numerous clashes between demonstrators and security forces, which have used tear gas and live bullets in the past two days to disperse the crowds.\nViolence has erupted in several regions in northern Iraq over the payment of salaries and employment, and have in turn sparked unrest in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Russia, Jordan, Kuwait and Iran.\nDemonstrations were observed in Koyuncu, in Turkey's western province of Hakkari, near the Kurdish region of north-eastern Iraq.\nThere, anti-government protests began on Tuesday, and several people were killed and more than 100 wounded on Wednesday in Istanbul and Ankara.\nOn Tuesday, around 20 people were killed and hundreds injured when security forces used live bullets and water cannon to disperse tens of thousands of people in Baghdad, who took to the streets in support of the protests that have continued throughout Iraq's Kurdistan Region and the rest of the country.\nThe protests have been held after the Kurds were refused payment of salaries and were threatened with dismissal and arrests by their own government.\nIn response to those demonstrations, the Kurdistan Regional Government warned on Saturday of mass arrests of those who participated in the protest.\nAnkara has warned that those who participate in the protests will be punished, including those from the Kurdistan Democratic Party and other Kurdish parties, and their leaders.\nIn Turkey's southern province of Adana, a demonstration in the Kurdish region of Diyarbakir was held on Wednesday after Kurdish youths were detained by authorities after burning T\u00fcrk, the logo of Turkey's flag.\nThe youths threw petrol bombs at security forces who responded by firing tear gas bombs and water cannon aimed at dispersing the crowd, leaving nine people wounded, said local media.\nOther demonstrations were held on Tuesday, in the central provinces of Istanbul and Eski\u015fehir, and in the province of Mersin, on the southwest coast of Turkey.\nThere were no deaths in Eski\u015fehir city, while the number of injured was about 60 people.\nIn Istanbul, where the demonstrations were most violent, security forces used tear gas and live bullets to disperse the crowds.\nIn addition, the Kurdistan Regional Government's Office of Public Information (ROKI) said at least 80 people had been injured across the region, including 36 people in Diyarbakir, 20 in Kirkuk and 13 in Erbil.\nIn Russia, police detained dozens of protesters on Tuesday who had come together in Makhatchkala, Russia's capital of Kuban to chant slogans against the government of President Vladimir Putin.\nSome of the protestors were detained at police headquarters while others chanted slogans against corruption and for better services.\nIn Kuwait, scores of Kwaitis broke into the Grand Mosque of Kuwait and shouted slogans, saying that only the will of the people could bring an end to corruption and poverty in the Kwait.\nIn Iran, the president of the Shia dominated Khorasan province also made a televised appeal to the demonstrators to come out and say \u201cNO\u201d to government corruption and unemployment.\nPrime Minister Ahmar Al Hussaini said that the government would not stop its fight against corruption.\n\u201cOur people had a right to complain and we will not let them down.

{"prompt":"Air traffic controllers ended a strike at Senegal s main airport on Friday , a union leader said , after shutting it down for most of the day over demands for more training and transportation","text":"Air traffic controllers ended a strike at Senegal s main airport on Friday, a union leader said, after shutting it down for most of the day over demands for more training and transportation.\nThe union\u2019s president, Mame Birane S\u00e8ye, said he had given the ministry of air traffic control ( MTC ) the option of reopening the airport to aircraft between 6 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. on Monday. Strikers have closed the airport 24 hours a day since Wednesday morning.\n\u201cAir traffic controllers are ready to continue their work,\u201d S\u00e8ye said after the meeting, saying no one will be allowed in \u201cuntil the strike has a final decision.\u201d Air traffic control has been closed since the morning.\nThe airport was closed all day Friday, as strikers refused to allow the flights to land or take off. The union\u2019s president said strikers took part in mass meetings at the airport and asked for support, even from local authorities. A total of 11 airlines had been affected by the strike.\nThe MTC also met with the strikers late Friday afternoon. \u201cAir traffic controllers were ready to resume their activities when the strike has a final decision,\u201d MTC head Aly Ngouille Ndiaye told journalists.\nHowever, Ndiaye stressed that if the strikers do not reopen the airport to flights, Senegal would suspend the flights to and from Dakar for 72 hours, while negotiations will continue at a higher level.\nThousands of people had already fled, on Thursday evening, the scene of the blast, in which 18 people, including three French tourists, were killed. Some 200 persons had been treated at a hospital.\nThe police also managed to stop six Islamist militants who entered the city by crossing a barrier on the highway.\nThe militants came as the presidential run-off elections were held, with Mamadou Ousmane Niang winning with more than 60% of votes.\nMeanwhile, a senior police official said that Senegalese officials had sent a delegation to the Nigerian government to convey the condolences of the people of Senegal over the blasts in Niamey, where a similar attack took place on February 15. He added that the delegation was composed of officials from the intelligence services. They visited the Foreign Ministry in order to convey the condolences of President Macky Sall, according to the police official.\nSenegal sent a delegation to Nigeria to convey the condolences of the people of Senegal over the blasts in Niamey, where a similar attack took place on February 15.\nThe delegation was composed of officials from the domestic and international security services, according to local media.The visit took place on Tuesday, days after three French tourists, including a child, and 17 other people were killed when four bombers blew themselves up in the capital of northern Nigeria.\nHundreds of people rallied in Niamey, at the crash sites, and in other areas in support of the French, saying the attack had been \u201cone more example\u201d of the jihadists targeting French interests.\nOn February 15, four suicide bombers blew themselves up in four separate locations in Niamey, killing at least 17 people, including nine foreigners, and injuring several others. At least two foreigners were among the dead. The bomber was not identified. The explosion was in a car park inside a shopping mall.\nThe attack was followed 10 minutes later by another suicide bombing in the centre of the capital. An explosives expert said he believed that the two attacks were linked to each other, but he was not satisfied with the investigation.\nAt the scene of the explosion, several people wearing the traditional black Muslim headscarf were seen shaking their hands as security forces searched the area for the next bomber.","token_len":765,"entropy":[9.6685,4.6935,10.0824,5.1243,6.695,2.298,12.4672,11.811,5.0674,1.4096,1.5197,2.2054,1.4736,3.9418,7.8257,3.9311,0.2234,1.7968,2.4949,9.0332,3.5952,0.0813,1.5615,6.1459,0.1808,0.258,0.6099,5.7542,6.1783,1.3437,2.9045,4.835,1.6338,7.3903,0.7479,0.2685,13.7856,3.3504,16.5672,9.0574,1.7328,3.0197,0.7652,5.239,4.9673,7.4542,5.5978,4.9371,6.1869,9.7007,0.6735,0.7738,2.7866,1.7983,5.2045,1.4431,6.2931,2.3946,3.5293,2.7509,0.8761,4.1045,7.6001,4.5051,0.1789,2.2926,3.4454,0.5286,5.3764,0.3539,0.53,0.9608,3.1767,5.8727,6.4736,2.8176,2.5708,0.0005,0.0004,0.0293,4.5569,0.1244,2.4246,0.7982,0.0002,0.0004,0.0047,2.9709,2.0352,0.7273,9.2335,3.4216,0.0304,3.8488,6.1058,1.1897,1.137,5.8053,0.4046,0.6611,0.0106,2.2475,4.5391,3.8983,1.0417,0.389,5.091,5.1614,9.183,0.5744,0.1536,3.9522,6.9755,0.426,4.43,2.3216,1.5239,2.1608,6.4557,6.8857,2.6733,0.094,0.0013,0.5531,4.2089,1.5066,3.8568,1.724,4.0949,5.7554,2.5502,4.3498,0.6073,2.2897,4.0074,9.4412,0.3765,3.9572,1.556,4.3988,4.5671,7.4222,2.9418,3.4502,1.1321,4.8157,3.09,7.6215,0.1521,3.0095,2.1849,1.3367,2.7961,1.5932,2.0879,3.4835,2.5615,0.5582,1.955,3.6196,1.9167,1.6619,5.274,0.6914,2.6693,1.5707,3.3471,5.5278,4.2731,0.1199,3.0893,2.3519,5.1694,0.9311,4.889,3.9315,2.387,0.112,1.1046,2.1123,2.8754,3.3322,0.3307,0.0185,0.8151,2.705,8.6002,5.2443,3.5551,0.1289,5.0828,3.0329,2.5645,0.7688,0.3646,2.2488,5.0988,1.6412,5.0585,2.9164,3.9605,5.0388,3.9652,2.6555,0.3338,4.4648,5.1838,0.0218,3.9335,4.9089,2.5186,1.8743,2.2909,1.1548,0.3772,0.2426,1.0984,0.3777,1.6916,4.3349,0.03,4.163,7.072,0.7153,1.6577,4.7415,5.4265,1.0542,2.0972,1.8124,5.1919,0.4225,4.0723,0.1386,0.1497,2.4899,2.7557,0.1359,1.5928,0.7513,6.5464,4.9356,0.7135,0.4419,3.8607,0.5427,0.0928,0.0477,0.8417,0.3193,0.6417,3.5679,2.2688,4.6012,8.8834,9.0348,4.1502,9.7214,7.4156,4.1248,0.4127,1.6604,3.8556,0.6606,0.5363,5.3214,0.0309,4.4733,0.0021,0.0004,4.3327,0.3077,4.6999,0.6669,3.1762,2.6566,0.0602,4.9407,0.4965,0.1468,3.6994,3.0249,1.3622,12.5793,1.8827,6.6753,2.0443,2.4067,2.3824,2.2256,0.0064,4.67,0.0045,2.4153,4.8613,0.0302,2.209,3.6952,4.9598,2.652,1.1418,4.9506,2.2271,4.9074,0.1902,0.3806,0.4732,7.4811,0.1801,1.5903,3.6097,3.3081,5.7063,5.5479,5.645,2.7942,2.8735,0.4683,5.3489,8.1487,0.0623,1.6409,7.9949,2.2882,2.7947,2.6368,5.4734,0.3048,3.2137,0.2624,2.429,6.0088,2.7276,0.1929,0.2354,0.225,0.7787,4.8137,4.2697,6.3674,2.3408,0.7834,4.9615,1.0006,1.9796,0.5943,1.9383,0.6505,1.8035,5.1646,3.9212,5.4973,0.0159,3.3803,6.2478,7.8446,0.985,2.5274,3.7745,0.2274,4.7051,4.9493,5.5573,2.6822,5.5959,2.6566,0.7948,3.0807,1.4099,1.1787,1.7004,3.6892,4.7988,5.1783,2.1369,5.6184,8.2721,0.3555,0.2268,2.9489,1.1386,2.3155,2.5312,2.245,8.4791,1.4449,0.0042,7.7033,4.7117,0.0914,0.0128,6.8518,2.6358,5.3043,3.9655,4.4476,0.0221,3.1893,2.2056,0.0626,2.6044,0.7424,1.1448,4.6794,0.1008,2.5925,4.3025,2.3235,0.4194,0.6897,1.6463,11.0708,0.3073,0.004,0.0004,4.3626,1.1602,4.2024,1.5739,1.7476,0.4372,1.3063,6.7413,4.0096,0.7503,5.2514,1.1746,4.7167,0.8225,0.6813,2.5884,0.7509,1.938,4.2325,0.1236,5.8222,3.2635,7.4301,3.3372,1.5805,1.7742,2.4474,2.8211,5.2871,2.0034,1.2357,0.0023,1.2637,3.9491,3.1032,0.3144,4.8102,1.8768,0.0876,0.9921,2.6543,1.6134,6.5278,0.0894,3.7854,0.3314,0.8456,5.3666,2.1628,1.8748,6.3769,4.4617,0.7491,10.0428,0.2757,1.741,5.6889,0.0136,1.5641,1.2271,0.3742,0.4176,5.9586,9.5112,4.8146,1.0908,4.5406,3.0532,5.0122,0.0042,0.8923,5.4226,0.0944,0.1107,0.3298,3.3214,0.0568,6.1398,1.0811,0.3362,0.3014,1.3651,1.5964,0.8384,0.8307,0.0967,0.0363,0.3063,0.1256,0.0222,0.2625,0.0538,0.0592,0.3321,0.0522,0.0205,0.0011,0.0005,0.0875,0.0508,0.0042,0.0007,0.0078,0.0026,0.0002,0.0109,0.0086,0.0083,0.166,1.1147,1.6897,5.044,1.3226,0.0852,0.0008,0.1197,0.0063,0.003,12.7805,3.272,0.9285,0.7147,0.6641,1.1103,2.5854,0.0041,6.2457,1.5945,0.8101,7.1617,5.8162,3.49,0.0049,1.2176,2.8278,1.2906,6.3406,0.1547,5.5283,3.6017,0.4945,2.4169,0.8885,1.2714,7.4242,0.2378,5.2625,5.1299,2.9239,1.4166,0.2326,0.1994,2.0318,5.0133,6.1616,1.9783,0.0275,0.0054,1.2011,1.6479,1.7129,2.6362,5.5023,0.2353,0.8648,0.9579,6.5445,0.1191,0.9253,5.7367,0.6442,2.8805,0.0022,0.0017,1.9442,6.1146,1.2369,8.8403,4.3211,1.9522,2.774,2.1242,3.4761,3.0643,2.4457,5.5184,0.0191,0.678,4.0273,3.3632,6.0031,1.8552,2.3926,2.4753,1.4942,17.764,1.6254,6.7351,3.623,3.1091,2.2083,2.9043,1.1408,1.3075,6.9603,4.372,3.3326,4.9206,0.946,0.588,3.7121,4.1179,1.4389,0.1632,3.7831,2.4708,0.2052,1.7275,0.0048,0.0099,0.8822,7.2706,1.8083,3.7339,0.391,1.5588,0.0028,0.0008,0.6866,1.0281,1.6641,0.0,2.8718,0.1626,1.4394,0.9299,3.2398,2.7123,1.1543,1.7697,0.8649,4.2343,0.597,0.3693,4.4364,0.1349,3.1957,4.238,0.4721,3.2611,0.5496,0.507,0.5788,2.2301,5.2571,2.2319,4.2231,1.4467,0.7855,2.5355,6.2187,1.9783,4.6408,2.2872,3.7334,2.2957,5.5172,1.0766,2.2087,0.3893,1.4748,0.8382,1.6325,3.3768,1.8004,3.5824,9.09,3.6164,0.0534,0.1823,2.0257,1.6378,1.2393,0.8616,1.3791,5.7085,0.0512,1.551,0.5962,2.0136,4.7514,5.176,1.7787,1.9134,3.8176,1.7956,1.7999,0.8207,2.8957,2.288,0.5062,1.8354,2.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank , breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her","text":"President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her predecessor\u2019s approach to economic policy.\nThe announcement was made days after Powell delivered testimony to U.S. lawmakers expressing confidence in Congress\u2019 support for his plans for the United States.\nPowell is now the subject of Congressional, market, and U.S. economic officials\u2019 intense scrutiny, especially in the days ahead as the president moves forward with implementing his policy agenda while facing intense challenges from the Senate.\nDespite having taken office nearly two years ago, President Donald Trump appeared to be planning to bypass much of Congress \u2014 notably the U.S. Senate \u2014 while implementing many of his agenda items, including his tax plan. He continued to do so throughout the first several days of his presidency, as he continues to roll-out items even though Congress has adjourned and is scheduled to return in January.\nWith a majority of Republican senators, a simple majority of Democrats in the lower chamber, and the support of his Cabinet, Trump intends to push forward with items that make him popular within his core GOP base, yet alienate many of his moderate constituents, the Democratic party, and many of the non-partisan observers who hold Congress in higher regard than the president.\nIn an email address to the Federal Reserve board of governors on Thursday, Trump said he was \u201cthankful \u201dfor Yellen and that she \u201chas done an extraordinary job.\u201d\nA woman at an election sign signing session is asked if she supports President Donald Trump.PHOTO: REUTERS \/ MANDEL NGAN\nThe U.S. economy grew only 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, compared to an advance of 0.7 per cent in the second quarter, a sign that the economy may not be picking up the pace it will need moving forward, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s analysis released on Thursday.\n\u201cThe economy in this last quarter of 2016 is clearly not doing as well as we had hoped \u2026\u201d, the Commerce Department said in the analysis of economic data for the third quarter of 2016.\n\u201cThe economy appears more on a downward trend than any time in the last two decades,\u201d said Tim Evans, chief economist at West Monroe Partners, which tracks economic data and predicts GDP growth.\nThe Commerce Department projects that the economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is just above the 2.7 per cent pace in the third quarter.\nStill, the Commerce Department noted that unemployment benefits are scheduled to end in December and that employment growth is expected to decline to its lowest in a decade, at or under 160,000.\nAnalysts said those factors could push consumers to tighten spending in anticipation of the December end of benefits, as well as higher inflation.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, when the last data was released, the economy shrunk just 0.2 per cent, on the basis of the latest figure announced on Thursday.\nThe unemployment rate fell one percentage point in August to 3.7 per cent, the jobless rate reached a historic low of 3.3 per cent early last month, and monthly wage growth has stayed positive, all signs of the economy\u2019s improvement.\nThe Federal Reserve may also cut interest rates again next week when it begins to review the economic data gathered in the third quarter of 2016.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 02, 2016, with the headline 'Trump taping Powell to Fed chair as economy not picking up pace'.

For example, physical exercise may temporarily increase the heart rate to as much as 100 beats per minute. A person's heart rhythm is affected by physical factors and psychological factors, and the factors have a profound impact on the heart.\nIt is known to affect the normal functioning of the human heart when the left and right ventricles are asymmetrically structured at rest and during exercise. It is known that during exercise, if the left ventricle is able to function optimally, it can improve the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. According to a previous study, it is reported that the abnormal balance in the left and right sides of the heart, such as an increase in left ventricular function and an increase in right ventricular function, may cause heart disease.\nIn a previous study, the researchers investigated the left atrium in addition to the left ventricle. In this experiment, the researchers investigated the left atrium and left ventricle at rest and at various speeds during exercise and found that the greater the heart rate of the subjects, the greater the pressure in both the left and right atria.\nIt can be clearly seen from the above figures that, based on the resting heart rate of the subjects, the pressure of the left atrium is higher than that of the right atrium, and the pressure difference increases as the stroke volume increases during exercise. Based on the pressure difference, it can be concluded that during exercise, an imbalance in left and right structures of the heart leads to a higher pressure in the left atrium, and this increased pressure can be observed during the recovery phase of the

{"prompt":"Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country s constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule , potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency . A provision in the current","text":"Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country s constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule, potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency. A provision in the current constitution forbids Museveni from seeking a third term in office, ending in 2021. But MPs changed the language around how parliament will decide how many more times he can run, giving him new leeway. The decision was passed with 78 votes to 0. It also gave Museveni the right to amend the constitution and the electoral commission has already been advised to set 2020 for the elections. The amendment must now be ratified by the president and confirmed by parliament. Museveni has been president for 31 years and his party is believed to have secured a majority of seats but if it loses too many votes in the legislature it will have a harder task in getting the amendment through parliament. However, the coalition has already signalled it will work towards a win. Speaking to reporters after the vote, the opposition All Progressive Congress secretary general Jotham Mutumbo says the amendment would put the country and all Ugandans on dangerous course. Mutumbo says if not ratified, Museveni could then decide to go for a fourth term, which would be a serious blow to peace and stability of the country. He believes that Museveni will then try to force the opposition party out of power and rule by decree. President Museveni is the first leader to be constitutionally barred from running for more than a third term. However, he has long refused to back down from a desire to have his own country s laws and policies made. The constitutional amendment would give Museveni a head-start for the elections of 2020, if he wanted to. A constitution amendment bill approved by parliamentary vote would enable President Yoweri Museveni to contest a future presidential election and rule the country by decree without a free vote by the people, the opposition told state broadcaster on Tuesday.\nPresident Museveni has been constitutionally barred from running for another three-year term and the current ruling party in Uganda has already lost the support of some legislators. Speaker David Kirwabo has made it clear by the terms of the amendment, that the party of President Museveni is not able to oppose the amendment. He believes the amendment will be ratified before the election and will then give rise to chaos in the post-election period. There are growing concerns from activists and opposition leaders that the amendment will enable the current government to for all future elections. In case the law is not ratified, the parliament will have to find another way of getting rid of President Museveni, who is seen as a strong foe of the rule of law, who has ruled the land for 31 years. What makes this amendment so serious is that it is not just a possible threat to President Museveni s rule, but to the whole democratic process in Uganda. The opposition is afraid that once this amendment is ratified, it will be so easy for President Museveni to rule Uganda by decree without a vote and in essence will stop the rule of the constitution and the rule of law. The government, meanwhile has also shown its confidence that the amendment will be ratified before the scheduled elections for 2020. In an interview to a state broadcaster last week, the speaker of parliament David Kirumba, assured the crowd that the amendment will be ratified before the elections at the end of year. While the amendment was passed in parliament, the opposition is calling for the president to be charged for failing to fulfill his constitutional mandate to pass the legislation. In a statement last week, the opposition party, the All Progressive Congress, told the Ugandan people that an amendment to the constitution should not be considered a reason to call for the resignation of the

{"prompt":"Venezuela s ruling Socialist Party won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships contested in Sunday s local elections , President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday . According to the national election board s","text":"Venezuela s ruling Socialist Party won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships contested in Sunday s local elections, President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday. According to the national election board s official results, PSUV got 99 percent of the seats in the city, state, regional, and national assemblies, the Venezuelan media quoted Maduro s spokesman Delcy Rodriguez as saying. More: Chavez says he plans on running for president again in 2022 Maduro, a political ally of President Hugo Chavez, announced the results on state TV from the presidential palace of Miraflores. He acknowledged that he had lost about 8,000 votes to former President and party chief Henrique Capriles, though his party retained the largest vote proportion. Chavez retweeted a link to a Venezuelan newspaper with the news. It says : \" After 9am, we celebrate our victory.\" The opposition says the election was not free of irregularities, and the United States and other countries have urged Venezuelans not to go to the polls. Venezuela and its socialist leader Chavez have been embroiled in a bitter civil war for nearly a decade, as the government accuses the armed opposition group. The vote is seen as critical to determining which of the candidates Ch\u00e1vez or Capriles has the support of the Maduro government s ruling coalition. Maduro has been in power since 2013 and has a 10 in favor approval rating in a mostly unpopular poll released by the opposition-led Moral Support for the Presidency. The opposition coalition says the ruling coalition has only about 4 in favor approval rating. The opposition coalition includes the three political parties that backed Capriles, including the anti-Ch\u00e1vez League and the pro- Chaves Un Nuevo Tiempo party. Capriles said he is now waiting for the government to admit defeat. The opposition coalition is planning to boycott a new electoral vote as soon as this week, though the three parties that withdrew from the last vote have yet to call for a boycott. \"I want to speak in the first person,\" said Capriles s spokeswoman Patricia de Ceballos. \"We have no trust in the electoral process that is in the hands of the opposition.\"\nWashington D.C. The US State Departments Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday he thinks Russia\u2019s election interference was not a big factor in US President Donald Trump\u2018s lost the presidential election. As of this week, there has been some indication that election-related disinformation campaigns played a role in the election outcomes, but experts have not been able to identify or measure a causal correlation between information campaigns and the election outcomes. Pompeo did not cite specific examples in his Sunday comment, but said that Moscow\u2019s intervention in other countries s elections had \u201chad a profound positive impact\u201d in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, which voted for the incumbent administrations in power. \u201cSo I would not say that the Russia election interference was not an issue today,\u201d he said. However, he did not say what the President or officials said about what Russia might have done to tarnish Trump\u2019s image to the voters. On Friday, former Trump campaign Chief of Staff Paul Manafort told ABC News that the Trump campaign considered launching a coordinated foreign election interference campaign. CNN reported that both candidates spent a lot of money trying to influence the elections. The media outlet found campaign disinformation ads online showing Trump with questionable health, Russia and Ukraine, the use of the children\u2019s health insurance program Child Health Plus by the Clinton campaign, and the use of voter registration drives conducted by black Americans against Trump.

{"prompt":"Argentina s Congress was on track to pass a pension reform measure on Monday , even as stone-throwing protesters rushed police outside the capitol building and the country s main union called a 24-hour general","text":"Argentina s Congress was on track to pass a pension reform measure on Monday, even as stone-throwing protesters rushed police outside the capitol building and the country s main union called a 24-hour general strike.\nA key measure was being debated in parliament, but the standoff came to a standstill after security forces used tear gas and batons to disperse the protesters who had set up tent-like camps in front of the parliament building to demand the parliament remove the measure.\nWith the lawmakers unable to get to their chambers for voting at a time of day when most people are at work, the lawmakers did not vote on the controversial pension law as scheduled.\nThe lawmakers, however, decided at the last minute to put the measure on the agenda for Monday after negotiations. They decided to pass the measure on Monday to end the protests.\nIt was a compromise between the lawmakers and the protesters. The government demanded that the pension reform law be voted on immediately, but the lawmakers agreed to wait for a day to make sure they have all the votes.\nLater on Monday, it was reported that the government was considering a possible date for the law s vote, saying:\nWe are considering voting on the law after the 24-hour general strike. We hope to continue dialogue with the unions.\nThe Argentinean Union of Workers is calling for a 24-hour general strike today (Monday), the first since the country s left-wing coalition took power last year in Argentina s first-ever democratic elections.\nIn a statement, the union said:\nThe decision to go on strike is the result of the failure of the ruling government in the past year to implement the reform it promised to make necessary for a dignified economic, social and pension plan in the Argentine national state\u2026\nLast year, the country s economy grew by 8.8 percent, but wages stagnated. The new Argentinean congress, which was sworn in a month ago, promised to make a number of pension reforms to bring a better life for the country s older population.\nThere have been several incidents of demonstrations against the government in the last few days. It had been called a 24-hour general strike before it was decided to move forward with the day s work. Some activists and police said that the police were forced to use force in order to disperse the demonstrators.\nPolice say 200 people have been arrested over the recent protests. In its statement, the union, which is affiliated with left-wing trade unions in Latin America, says that they want to see an end to political corruption and to call for constitutional reform.\nThe protesters in general want an end to the government s attempts to pass laws that will only benefit a few at the expense of the majority.\nThe unions are also calling for the government to end the practice of hiring friends or relatives in positions of responsibility in public service.\nThe recent incidents have made life difficult for thousands of people, who have been forced to face the heat in the daytime and be freezing at night.\nThe government says that it believes in dialogue as a way of reaching consensus, but the union says that there has not been progress and they have already said that they will continue the fight.\nIt is also said that the unions called a 24-hour general strike in support of the demonstration, meaning that there is no way of getting through these tough times.\nAccording to the latest government figures, the unemployment rate is a staggering 25.4 percent.

TV star Salvador Nasralla ,","text":"The Honduran opposition battling President Juan Orlando Hernandez over a disputed presidential election proposed on Tuesday that a run-off be held if authorities would not recount the entire vote. TV star Salvador Nasralla, who contested Hernandez`s run-off for president on January 28 but lost by a narrow 6 percent, said that a new election must be held unless the election commission recounts the votes. \u201c If [ Hernandez ] would not do the election again, we will do it, \u201d Nasralla, a longtime anti- Hernandez activist, told the radio station radio Progreso. He said they would petition the Supreme Court to take action on the election. [ ]\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would begin issuing temporary protected status to immigrants who received asylum after a judge ordered most current and previous immigrants not to be admitted to the United States. Under the administration\u2019s new policy,, people with asylum or temporary protected status from other countries are not deemed to be ineligible for permanent residency. \u201cAsylum seekers and migrants applying for reunification with a family member have been among the group of people at the bottom of the priority list for admission,\u201d said a statement from acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, based on Trump administration rules under which it does not offer a pathway to citizenship to those arriving in the United States illegally. \u201cHowever, on December 4, 2020, the immigration courts ruled that there was no legal justification to bar these individuals from making initial applications for asylum that may lead to permanent residence. \u201d [ ]\nThe UK Government has introduced new requirements to help it prepare for Brexit, while also keeping its economy open to foreign trade. The moves will bring the UK\u2019s trade relationship with the EU closer to the post-Brexit relationship, meaning that the UK will continue to apply the rules from the bloc to its own citizens as well as EU nationals. The UK will align more closely with the EU\u2019s customs arrangements for goods, with both sides agreeing to: (i) an additional single customs declaration on their goods, and (ii) the introduction of a common customs tariff. In addition, the legislation for the UK-European Parliament Economic and Financial Affairs Committee agreement to enable the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU to continue in a special and differential manner, or similar arrangement, will be amended. These measures will help the UK align more closely with the EU\u2019s customs arrangements after Brexit. [ ]\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union would cost the country\u2019s gross domestic product between 0.7 percent, or a \u00a335 billion (US$48 billion), and 1.7 percent, or a \u00a364 billion (US$87 billion), a study has found. The research analysed the economy\u2019s current position and the likely economic impacts, and it showed the economic effects are likely to fall somewhere between the two estimates. In some areas of the economy, such as agriculture and transport, it has found the economic effects are likely to be relatively limited. However, areas like financial services, retail distribution and property have suggested a greater impact. [ ]\nGermany`s ruling party is preparing to back a law to make it easier for migrants to get access to certain social services. The law, called \u201eWettbewerbsbeh\u00f6rde\u201c (\u201cemployment agency\u201d) or \u201eJobagentur\u201c, will only apply to foreign workers, according to reports. The current law does not allow foreign migrants to take advantage of social services, such as care for children and the elderly, unless they spend a relatively long time in the country.

North Korea fired a missile that","text":"North Korea s latest missile launch is a further unacceptable violation of its international obligations, a spokeswoman for the European Union foreign affairs chief said on Tuesday. North Korea fired a missile that appeared to fall near Japan late on Monday as the peninsula faced its deadliest winter so far. As UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon discussed Pyongyang s latest launch with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other leaders at a security meeting on Monday afternoon, his spokesman told reporters that the latest missile launch was an unacceptable violation of international obligations. Meanwhile, the latest missile launch came as South Korea warned that it would take measures against North Korea. Its Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Seoul would take strong and united action against the nuclear-armed state on Tuesday, while a spokesman for the military said troops could be mobilised in Seoul if further military warnings were sounded. North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles at a military ground defence headquarters that overlooks key sea lanes in the Yellow Sea Saturday night. Four missiles came down within a five-kilometre radius of an area where troops are set to attend another ground defence drill. North Korea on Monday said the launch was carried out as part of its deterrence policy to make South Korea feel the full weight of what it called a military occupation of its North. There was no immediate reaction from South Korea. There could be no political solution to the South Korean and US confrontation over North Korea. It is about military action to defend our national security, said Dr Kang, who is also the secretary-general of the Korea Association of Internationalisation, a think tank. The latest missile launch is another violation of our resolution and of the relevant military treaties, he said, saying that the United Nations Security Council must take decisive action, including on North Korea s sanctions. Meanwhile, the Japan Coast Guard ordered an air search to find the missile because it could fall in close to Tokyo, but an official said he was not sure exactly where the missile might be, a situation he expected to continue. It s a little difficult to speculate on the missile, said the official, who added that the government is preparing in case the missile does strike. If we find the missile, there are ways to get rid of it, he said. A United Nations report released this week said the North also fired a satellite-launched ballistic rocket at the sea on Sunday that struck a high seas area more than 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of where the flight path of the Saturday missile may have been predicted. UN Security Council Resolution 2170 says all UN member states are obliged to take \" appropriate coercive measures \" to enforce sanctions on North Korea that UN Security Council imposed on January 23. The United States says its sanctions only apply to the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The United States has also threatened North Korea with military action. United Nations sanctions target North Korea s arms shipments, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and its human rights record. Washington accuses North Korea of carrying out at least six nuclear-explosion tests, including a hydrogen bomb test in 2006. The most recent nuclear test was carried out in January. At least 70 people were injured in an anti-war demonstration in the North's largest city, Pyongyang, yesterday. A spokesman for North Korean military operations in the city of Kaesong said the demonstration was planned ahead to prevent the army from entering an industrial zone owned by South Korea. However, the military was quick to dismiss the claim. The protests have grown to almost 200 since the demonstrations began in March. Many are held to promote an anti-US atmosphere by throwing firecrackers and other objects at government buildings and military armoured vehicles. The protests prompted military leaders from both countries to meet last week in Seoul to discuss ways to avoid a confrontation after nearly 10 years of disputes between the governments, including a series of border skirmishes. -Source: Associated

{"prompt":"A makeshift bomb exploded outside a Greek court in Athens early on Friday shattering windows and damaging the facade of the building , police officials said . Shots were also fired at a person guarding","text":"A makeshift bomb exploded outside a Greek court in Athens early on Friday shattering windows and damaging the facade of the building, police officials said. Shots were also fired at a person guarding a car carrying European Parliament's staff in the city's centre, police sources said. The attack comes as Greece fights to meet its economic targets for 2013 - setting up a new debt-burden relief plan with the EU and the International Monetary Fund that could see its financial crisis-hit economy shrink by one-quarter between now and 2016. More than one in four Greeks are unemployed or working part-time. EU\/IMF\/Greece debt-burden relief plan approved on Friday was designed to raise the minimum required rate of output growth in Greece to at least 1.5 per cent. The deal will also call for more cuts to the Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio, the ratio of the debt to the country\u2019s economy, which has almost doubled during the country's crisis. Greece will get a 6 billion euro ($8.2 billion) bailout program from the EU, the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). But Greece may never be able to repay the money and in the meantime will keep spending less than it earns because of austerity measures. It could become the first EU member state to default on its debts. Greece\u2019s public finances are \u201cat risk\u201d, a government official said on Friday. More than half of the country\u2019s tax revenue was due in two days, the minister of economics said. The Greek capital Athens had been shaken with a series of gun shots early Friday morning. Police said they had opened an investigation and identified two men as the shooters. They didn\u2019t say what caused the shots in the central business district a few blocks from the parliament. A witness said they believed the shooter to be a member of the opposition Labour party. A second witness named the shooters as a man and a woman. Police officers also opened an investigation into the violence around the parliament building as parliament was in session. The attack on the parliamentary building comes as a second wave of violence continues in the Greek capital Athens. The Greek police fired in the air as two men shouted \u201cGreek revolution\u201d in the centre of Athens\u2019s business district early Friday. Authorities fired in their direction and then arrested a man. Police officers and security personnel were seen wiping blood off the windows and doors of the parliament building where some workers and security personnel gathered. The violence was also reported in other parts of Greece, particularly Athens. The shooting took place around midnight and the attacker has reportedly been shot by the police. Police on Friday arrested a second man after three people were stabbed and another was hit by a gun in the Athens central train station area. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know about further incidents. We will have more information soon,\u201d a police spokesman said, without elaborating on the developments around the shooting in the central train station area. The shooting and stabbing in Athens came a day after six people including a man at the centre of a row over the controversial statue of the goddess Athena were wounded when firefighters were attacked in the southern port city of Patras. This was the third assault on a public figure this week. The last such incident rocked Greece\u2019s popular tourist destination of Olympia, where police had to intervene to save a statue of the goddess Athena after it was set aflame by protestors. Greece\u2019s public figures also are suffering from the economic chaos that has broken out. The government said the last two months were among its most difficult in a decade, with tax revenue down, public servants forced to work more hours and a rising homeless population. The crisis has cut demand and led to a sharp collapse in public

{"prompt":"A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with a bid by President Donald Trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries is legal . The 9th U.S . Circuit","text":"A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with a bid by President Donald Trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries is legal. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond said the decision to strike down portions of the executive order that aimed to block travelers from seven certain Muslim-majority countries for 90 days should be brought back to the Supreme Court. A three-judge bench, led by Chief Judge Susan Colomer Roberts, declined to decide that question, however, as it could have impacted the Trump administration's other travel-related actions. Trump, who is due to leave office on Jan 20, filed the appeal on Thursday as part of efforts to block the lower-court rulings. His lawyers also urged a stay that would have prevented the judge from certifying a lawsuit challenging the executive order. \"A decision has been reached here,\" Susan Colomer Roberts wrote. \"And the court intends to make a decision on this issue after it has a chance to do an appropriate factual analysis. The court will not, however, determine the merits of the case on the basis of that factual analysis. The Supreme Court should decide the merits of the case.\" The order's legal basis, which was a claim the president's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries was unconstitutional, has been upheld in multiple lower courts. The 9th Circuit had granted a stay of that ruling in March. It is unclear if Trump's argument could have been considered by the high court. Trump's lawyers argued in court papers that the 9th Circuit had erred on the law by finding that travel restrictions on people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen were unconstitutional. The appeals court's ruling was not expected to have any immediate impact on the Trump administration's travel policy, which remains controversial and has been under intense congressional scrutiny. Trump has also used executive orders to block the use of social media services, such as Snapchat and Twitter, and to limit use of cryptocurrency. On Thursday, he signed an order that will impose new regulations and restrictions on the manufacture, imports and sales of certain high-tech weapons systems to the U.S. military. \"(Trump) wants to make sure that our military doesn't lose ground to other countries,\" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Fla.), a congressional sponsor of the travel ban, in a statement. \"This new order will make our weapons systems stronger and allow our soldiers greater flexibility,\" she said. Earlier this year, the 9th Circuit also struck down another part of Trump's so-called travel ban as part of a larger litigation campaign. It had upheld a ban on travelers from a seven-nation travel ban that did not identify the countries that had been targeted. Washington's legal battle against restrictions on travel originated in an appeal by the legal firm of Albright Stonebridge in January. The U.S. Supreme Court had not ruled on the travel ban by the time Albright Stonebridge filed its lawsuit. The Trump administration has sought to cast doubt on the legal validity of the travel ban, especially on whether or not it constitutes an executive branch official refusing to perform a government duty. Trump signed a travel regulation Monday that temporarily blocked all travelers from six countries, including Syria, Iran, Somalia and Yemen, from entering the United States. The new rule takes effect January 29 and lasts until the end of September. In an earlier order issued in March, it had banned all travelers from seven countries, including Iraq, from entering the country for 90 days.

{"prompt":"Since taking office , U.S. President Donald Trump has shown an affinity , and perhaps even a deference , to the generals he has surrounded himself with in his Cabinet and at the White House","text":"Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has shown an affinity, and perhaps even a deference, to the generals he has surrounded himself with in his Cabinet and at the White House. It should come as no surprise that the Trump administration has tried to push the Army Corps of Engineers ( ACG ) out of its natural role, to which it has been uniquely placed for decades. But how is it that the Trump administration, a military-connected president, would try to push an agency that has served as a bastion of civil liberties, fairness to the governed, and environmental protection out of its role?\nIt is a matter of power politics. The President wants to cut the budget short, and cut is what he does best. He wants to keep as many special interests in place as possible at the expense of ordinary people and Congress. Thus, he has decided that the ACG needs to be reduced to a low level of funding.\nIt is also a matter of political philosophy. The current administration argues for a \u201c budget \u201d of war. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, former National Security Council Director James Jones gave the example of Afghanistan and said \u201c We need to know that we have the resources, the support, to protect our interests \u2014 in Afghanistan, the region, around the world. \u201d So he wants to put troops on the ground as he sees it, as a way of expanding military intervention.\nOf course, he has a point. U.S. troops have been sent in to do a variety of things, the most famous being the invasion of Iraq and the destruction of it. Today, our military is at war in seven countries around the world. In Asia, for example, U.S. troops are now the top military presence in the world, with their presence in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Guam and even the Philippines.\nThis, of course, includes the Vietnam War. But in the course of its military campaigns, the United States created a whole generation of Americans who have been conditioned to accept the U.S. troop buildup as their natural and correct role in the world. And so, the Trump administration is not giving any thought about how our troops are being used. Our troops are a major issue to the president, and that is reflected in the fact that he has given no thought about whether to accept the advice ( that he has no opinion ) of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates who suggested to the president to pull out of Afghanistan.\nAs one of our recent lawsuits demonstrates, many troops are sent into what were defined as \u201c hotspots \u201d, or locations of civil unrest to maintain order at the expense of respect for the human rights of the civilians engaged in such unrest.\nThe Trump administration argues that this is in service of the protection of American citizens and our foreign interests. I hope and pray that is true.\nFor as long as American soldiers have been sent into foreign countries to serve our interests, they have done so at the expense of the rights of the people they are supposedly meant to be protecting, whether they are citizens of the country into which they are sent or not.\nBut, since there is nothing American left in the world other than what we have left behind, it seems that it is no longer our place to protect the rights of our citizens from all around us. It seems that our national interests are the only ones that matter.\nAnd that seems to be true especially when one looks at the way that the U.S. military is being used in places where civil unrest is going on in our own country.\nThis is where it gets interesting because the U.S. military has traditionally shown a willingness to protect our civil liberties in other countries, but its willingness to do so is apparently waning now.","token_len":771,"entropy":[8.0326,6.3439,0.4436,6.4298,0.1161,0.0045,0.0074,0.7921,0.6007,0.0095,0.9278,5.3013,3.0699,3.6989,6.3483,2.0788,3.8558,1.1343,1.3775,8.4141,0.0511,0.1293,1.7385,1.6656,6.7413,3.1488,1.6097,6.427,0.0256,0.006,3.1351,1.7766,3.1898,2.3719,4.1199,0.7226,1.1015,0.0006,0.212,4.484,4.2733,1.3425,0.0107,0.0695,0.016,0.3678,1.782,3.2626,0.5814,0.9232,4.8371,0.1667,4.7932,1.9603,5.4115,3.3529,0.1668,0.0011,2.8023,11.5502,4.8605,0.1789,1.9797,0.0222,1.8603,5.3681,3.8839,3.1268,3.8632,4.3389,0.7762,1.033,1.3201,7.2677,2.5131,3.6071,1.9612,0.3189,4.4441,4.9736,3.3186,1.2433,0.6374,0.8847,4.058,0.2548,2.6215,4.1989,3.9989,2.966,8.3465,6.5244,0.9651,3.7928,4.4669,0.0747,3.2356,3.2376,2.2919,0.8283,1.3539,3.7155,1.709,0.933,6.2121,0.0013,0.1414,3.657,0.802,2.2978,7.3247,5.9523,1.663,7.3797,0.3198,0.3312,4.5827,0.9708,4.2639,0.0305,1.1406,3.1184,1.8939,0.5841,8.23,0.9151,2.6907,3.9032,0.0567,5.8973,3.708,0.894,1.7767,5.745,4.9001,0.6219,5.1283,1.5379,2.6018,6.9639,1.7051,1.5146,5.4046,8.6825,3.3439,0.9198,2.1539,3.0669,0.4383,2.1588,1.2281,0.3253,3.5812,6.171,0.7105,7.4824,2.4921,1.7529,2.438,0.2924,0.2043,4.4975,0.6077,1.7412,0.0027,5.5571,2.0874,2.2063,7.7804,0.3827,6.3909,0.5337,1.5279,1.4247,3.6745,1.6409,1.3418,3.7382,0.0039,3.9969,0.2025,0.5479,4.8847,1.2659,1.2529,5.1275,2.2498,0.8001,2.9262,1.4609,2.3433,3.0829,0.5014,3.4236,1.3839,0.0109,0.0057,3.0582,4.5642,0.4005,1.4516,4.8585,1.6908,7.0967,2.768,1.6015,17.2635,7.3301,7.7505,7.603,6.9069,3.2904,9.1729,2.5079,3.5414,3.1708,2.7918,2.2595,0.5377,1.6307,1.9881,0.3232,0.2173,3.6151,3.3483,0.0374,3.2457,2.1709,2.7411,6.6154,5.828,1.9645,2.2259,0.0343,4.5442,2.837,3.6138,5.6773,1.327,5.7543,1.6635,0.4744,5.2322,2.5216,2.0687,2.3356,2.626,3.0113,2.419,1.0552,4.2091,0.4219,2.2906,4.5548,1.179,3.3891,5.6875,4.0694,3.3421,0.7908,3.3461,4.4108,0.624,3.9477,0.0266,0.0967,0.88,4.0762,3.5142,3.8431,4.3609,2.0458,0.4998,4.2617,5.2418,2.03,0.2898,0.1297,4.135,4.8775,1.7088,3.5587,1.0924,3.1386,3.0827,2.0779,1.1207,5.8844,3.8408,5.7511,1.1285,1.2964,5.1007,0.0366,0.0945,3.3205,2.0323,2.7419,1.4673,0.4165,5.6529,0.0007,0.0014,0.0056,2.3904,2.1218,0.9893,5.2915,3.1028,0.9364,4.264,2.335,4.3258,0.0024,1.5025,1.3343,5.5914,0.9183,4.2562,1.233,1.0962,2.058,0.1168,0.1786,2.7497,0.7154,4.0518,0.0278,6.3731,0.7621,6.8246,0.4135,4.315,1.2605,1.2299,3.9953,2.1054,2.6992,5.3828,0.5848,3.7256,0.0015,0.1675,0.6939,2.98,7.0255,0.337,3.5892,0.2205,0.0145,3.148,0.0005,0.0017,0.0019,1.0286,1.0352,4.0627,5.3285,4.3332,2.227,3.2264,0.4253,1.0544,0.6647,1.4289,2.3072,5.0568,3.6116,1.0531,4.1895,0.6474,2.44,0.0715,3.0758,0.198,0.1254,5.5776,1.9519,4.0763,2.1296,1.6455,0.4891,1.4173,3.3201,4.6191,0.9061,0.0016,0.0028,4.4027,1.3834,7.3004,0.2599,1.2431,1.9883,3.3131,1.4496,5.6161,0.0013,2.9474,4.8074,3.7287,0.5362,0.7547,0.8517,0.0016,7.3339,1.3592,5.114,4.8926,0.082,4.3132,0.7155,2.3489,1.6665,6.2365,0.5849,3.7111,1.3872,4.464,0.0007,0.0015,0.1663,7.42,4.9013,1.3735,4.8996,5.1677,2.7824,6.3425,3.3515,1.7099,1.1479,0.3394,0.2795,3.0096,2.825,1.0748,2.5863,3.3002,0.1089,1.752,3.2366,5.0697,3.2574,2.1068,4.7363,1.9749,5.1002,1.7884,2.1115,2.302,1.5766,1.3218,6.1833,1.6862,0.5475,4.7224,5.1202,5.4757,4.3116,1.1843,3.4366,1.4643,0.7688,3.7959,0.7268,5.4966,0.1272,1.0908,2.096,0.0254,1.6297,0.8668,4.0123,1.9585,1.7353,2.6563,2.5134,2.3408,5.107,1.3955,8.2675,6.9807,8.581,2.2976,1.4579,4.7546,6.0222,2.2673,0.8651,4.4384,2.3847,0.0254,0.3377,1.4808,0.0374,3.8707,4.3623,3.1286,1.7074,2.2138,5.3245,5.3088,0.8102,0.3786,1.2619,1.1884,0.6024,4.1344,3.8761,1.4364,3.0377,5.2959,9.4657,4.0089,0.0573,4.3371,6.3174,1.5947,5.1591,2.8809,6.9435,4.4834,6.4257,0.4765,9.5203,1.4508,8.5881,0.033,0.4692,1.4208,4.1627,3.7678,4.8841,3.3552,5.5615,0.6342,5.4137,5.2653,1.4249,4.7013,1.5539,1.1845,0.0025,8.9791,0.192,1.1254,4.3804,0.2783,0.2682,1.629,3.1163,6.496,0.1804,2.6989,1.9779,0.1573,1.6286,2.2361,2.6096,0.124,4.7753,0.3964,2.9231,0.8699,4.477,6.9581,0.3022,1.7932,6.5237,0.0999,2.9445,1.2495,1.563,3.5357,4.6852,5.8672,0.5271,4.6228,5.4009,5.5893,1.179,0.1495,5.719,2.055,0.3882,2.1662,4.7401,4.8365,0.833,0.0205,4.2959,2.8778,1.2553,0.4727,3.9249,1.4159,4.5204,1.4682,1.397,3.0402,2.5536,2.438,0.3341,1.8934,0.1537,4.0352,0.2929,3.7332,0.6438,0.406,0.0058,1.8058,2.2,0.323,2.1381,1.5968,3.1986,2.4816,6.1829,5.6801,0.0076,5.0745,0.9082,2.7423,4.6101,1.571,0.7653,2.1059,0.6688,0.777,4.6569,8.4344,0.053,0.1139,0.8035,1.4559,0.5459,1.9911,0.1017,1.2248,2.895,3.0995,5.238,4.1257,0.6913,3.511,5.8761,7.3083,1.6064,0.9002,1.1329,4.9702,0.0047,3.7339,1.7291,1.6147,2.8258,4.0014,0.2839,2.1,2.8534,1.4477,3.4421,0.3238,3.6343,0.8053,3.4653,2.6855,0.1759,3.2214,1.9733,1.4606,0.1587,1.9684,1.1542,3.8079,5.0602,5.5429,1.4628,0.276,3.1328,1.9711,0.5289,2.0165,4.0249,2.3858,0.8481,5.1211,1.4332,0.7082,1.0775,1.687,0.7542,0.787,3.4714,2.2879,4.9167,0.1934,0.4958,4.0866,5.9647,1.9655,3.1829,1.8832,0.1696,0.5571,3.7519,1.7885,0.8273,2.7813,0.0006,0.0021,0.0057,1.3166,1.5579,1.5064,0.8789,2.3371,4.6003,1.9421,2.7262,

{"prompt":"Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) CEO Tim Cook has joined a chorus of business leaders who have voiced their opposition to President Donald Trump after he blamed white nationalists and anti-racism activists equally for violence","text":"Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) CEO Tim Cook has joined a chorus of business leaders who have voiced their opposition to President Donald Trump after he blamed white nationalists and anti-racism activists equally for violence in the U.S., in a lengthy interview published on Monday.\nIn the interview, Mr. Cook, on the first day of his visit to South Korea, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with the rise of racism in the U.S. and that he\u2019s \u201cbeen watching these developments over the last few weeks,\u201d according to the interview with Bloomberg News, quoted Friday.\n\u201cAs an American, I have tremendous respect for the leaders of South Korea, and I\u2019m grateful for all the things they\u2019ve done as an independent nation. But I\u2019ll tell you, as an American, the way you treat others is just as important as how you treat yourself, and if you don\u2019t treat others with the respect that you would want to have been treated, what does that say about you?\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet Friday.\nIn response, Mr. Cook, who serves as Chairman of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), said that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Twitter were \u201cdistasteful\u201d and said that he believes it to be \u201cwrong to hold people responsible for extremism that ultimately motivates violence.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not support intolerance and extremism in any shape or form,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve told President Trump there have been times when people have not spoken up for the issues they care about and I wonder where they have heard it, since I\u2019m sure you probably hear it everywhere. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us as a world to have voices that are not silent or muted.\u201d\nMr. Trump has accused the media and law enforcement of failing to investigate the National Socialist terrorist group neo-Nazi group Proud Boys. He has also accused Democrats and other critics of the group of seeking to \u201cdisown\u201d it.\nMr. Cook also cited racism and white supremacy as reasons for the protests in the U.S. that erupted in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.\n\u201cWe have to address these societal issues that have led to them and there is not one political party that can fix it overnight,\u201d he said.\nIn a separate interview with Fortune published on Friday, Mr. Trump was asked whether he thought white supremacy should be criminalized and rejected the idea.\n\u201cYou know what? Maybe it should be. I\u2019m sure it should be,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut a different way. I think they should be prosecuted, not criminalized.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments Friday come shortly after he was criticised by many for failing to condemn white supremacist violence and instead blaming law enforcement officers for the killing of Floyd, saying \u201cpolice officers should be applauded for killing the guys that are killing us\u201d.\nThe president has also recently urged members of his own Cabinet to resign after a series of leaks from top officials, including Michael Flynn, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff in his 2016 presidential campaign.

{"prompt":"The deputy director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau late on Sunday filed a lawsuit seeking to halt President Donald Trump from naming an official to run the watchdog agency on an interim basis","text":"The deputy director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau late on Sunday filed a lawsuit seeking to halt President Donald Trump from naming an official to run the watchdog agency on an interim basis.\nThe case, filed in federal court in Denver, comes days after former U.S. attorney general and current President of the National Association of Attorneys General Jeff Sessions was announced as the next U.S. chief lawyer. Trump\u2019s nominee had already left EPA in April on the heels of the agency\u2019s decision to overturn President Obama\u2019s executive directive banning \u201cfracking\u201d oil by drilling wells too deep.\nHowever, the suit argues that the president must wait until the agency\u2019s full board is appointed before making his choice. There are no formal requirements under the lawsuit, which is expected to take some time to be heard or go to trial.\n\u201cIn these exceptional circumstances, the court\u2019s decision to proceed with a lawsuit on the brink of the agency\u2019s move is troubling,\u201d said Michael Feller, executive director of the Consumers Union of California and a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The organization, along with the Environmental Defense Fund, consumer and environmental groups, sued over the agency being given emergency authority \u2014 to be over with for at least 45 days \u2014 when the full board has not even been announced, or even been able to be selected.\nIf the case is allowed to go forward, it is a long shot, given the courts have repeatedly blocked executive actions that have put a spotlight on potential abuses of authority by the president. But for an agency where a powerful president has been in charge for nearly three years, a lawsuit seeking to halt his action may not go unnoticed.\n\u201cThe idea that the agency would be able to continue to move as if everything was fine when it knew that the White House was going to be the last organization controlled by Donald Trump is frankly hard to swallow and extremely dangerous,\u201d said James Walker, a senior policy adviser at the advocacy group Sierra Club.\nThat\u2019s all the more reason for the administration to take the matter seriously and address the lawsuit swiftly and in a way that isn\u2019t viewed as a victory of Trump.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Washington, was signed by the Deputy Counsel of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, who heads a group within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Assistant Counsel Rebecca Macias served the agency. She recently left the consumer protection agency to become an associate director within the bureau, according to agency spokesman Tim Hurt. She has since left the bureau as well.\nThe suit filed by Mias alleges that by naming M. Scott Westerholz, a deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Labor and Statistics as the interim acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump \u201chas not taken his oath of office to protect consumers or enforce federal consumer laws with due fidelity and impartiality.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous that the president is trying to control the agency through a \u2018temporary appointment.\u2019 He is trying to remove the director from his oath of office to protect the American people\u2019s financial interests and not abuse power to protect his political agenda,\u201d said Brian Schindler, executive director of Common Cause, an anti-gerrymandering organization that filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs on behalf of the ACLU.\nMias joins the long list of officials who have quit their current positions to serve as the next U.S. administrator.

{"prompt":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered to play tour guide to Christian pilgrims on Sunday in a message relayed from Jerusalem , whose recognition as Israel s capital by U.S. President Donald Trump has split","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered to play tour guide to Christian pilgrims on Sunday in a message relayed from Jerusalem, whose recognition as Israel s capital by U.S. President Donald Trump has split Christians across the world.\nIsrael was established in 1948 as a Jewish country and Jerusalem is seen as the Jewish capital by most Muslims. Jerusalem in Islamic religious terms is called Al Quds, which translates to holy city in all but Arabic, so the statement by Trump will be particularly contested, he said.\nAn increasing number of the Palestinians see themselves as citizens of Israel. They have lived in the West Bank for some time, but after decades of conflict Israel has annexed parts of the territory and some of these people have seen their land confiscated and houses demolished.\nThe Palestinians have their own government in the West Bank, but international recognition of it is still denied, as Trump also did.\nThere was no time to stop Trump last week as he flew to Israel and made a historic announcement. Netanyahu has not commented yet.\nAccording to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jerusalem will be under the flag of Jerusalem, while the United States (Washington) will also be on one side to meet this matter, but Trump s position will change Jerusalem s situation from the status quo.\nIt seems that the Trump administration has made a series of steps that will lead to separation of Jerusalem, this was a huge mistake Donald Trump, Netanyahu told the Israeli media.\nTrump s announcement last week to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital was a move that will lead to an irreconcilable crisis in the Middle East.\nIn Jerusalem, the Israeli government has also put forward a plan to build a nearly 600-acre housing project in Temple Mount. According to the plan, the Jews living on East Jerusalem will not be able to go to the Old City except through a toll plaza.\nTrump also made decisions against Iran and Saudi Arabia last week. And Jerusalem will not accept the moves of the Trump administration, and if these issues are resolved, Israel and Trump s position are mutually acceptable, Netanyahu said.\nJerusalen is considered to be the holy city for Jews, Muslims and Christians. According to Israel, Jerusalem is the most holy and sacred city for them but the Palestinians see the Old City as the capital of their homeland.\nJerusalem is one of the most important cities in Israel, it has many sacred places for Muslims and Christians of any denomination, and on the other hand, the Jewish people have a sacred city.\nIn Jerusalem, thousands of Muslim residents have been forced to evacuate their homes because of Israeli construction projects near the Old City, and some Christian churches have also been burned on the edge of the Old City since the Israeli government took control of East Jerusalem.\nIn Jerusalem, Israeli authorities have confiscated land and demolished homes to build a bridge leading to the Jordan River, although religious leaders have refused to allow it. Jerusalem has no official state of Israel, but a series of historical events have resulted in Jerusalem becoming the capital of Israel.\nThe area known as the Old City of Jerusalem was a capital long ago and has always been a major city in the Middle East, but the Palestinian and Israeli governments have recognized the other side of the city as the capital of their countries, but Israeli officials and politicians have not conceded for decades.\nOn the other hand, Jerusalem was the capital of the Jewish people until 1948 when Israel was founded as a Jewish country, and there has been a dispute between the Palestinians and Israelis over the rights to Jerusalem.\nMore than 3.6 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip strip because they can enter Israel freely, and Palestinians have lived in Jerusalem since the Middle Ages.\nThe Palestinians believe that the entire Old City belongs to them, and that was the first place built by the first Jews after the end of the Old Testament era.","token_len":773,"entropy":[8.7696,0.0051,1.5254,0.0003,6.8975,2.0225,4.8947,11.5261,4.5003,0.7411,8.7592,3.7074,3.0083,2.2592,1.9259,2.3589,4.6694,6.5825,3.9341,1.167,2.2265,8.0652,9.7354,5.9851,1.7204,11.335,7.5144,4.0788,5.3873,0.0019,0.1261,0.0799,0.608,0.8557,0.0201,1.9737,7.1738,4.9302,2.1389,0.1232,1.8741,0.1596,0.2196,21.4892,4.5371,5.8154,0.7972,0.301,1.263,0.6714,0.4861,4.7582,1.9937,6.4048,1.0656,6.3971,0.2858,1.1309,3.5778,0.5454,1.8713,2.6181,2.8287,0.7974,5.9648,5.8579,8.0234,3.7788,1.5502,1.2152,3.3541,4.046,5.3052,0.4083,1.2112,2.7483,1.8515,0.8226,4.2838,1.5366,3.28,8.2476,5.7492,0.3387,1.7427,5.5295,1.997,4.7306,2.9027,4.714,5.4761,1.2996,5.2636,9.9955,3.2718,4.1485,0.4186,0.2636,0.1261,12.2107,7.3976,0.0981,0.0263,4.8225,4.4639,4.6333,3.8854,0.0958,5.2504,0.0989,0.5583,2.4394,2.8014,2.3575,4.9844,0.6586,1.2409,1.844,0.0008,0.8551,5.334,1.7378,0.8629,1.708,4.7786,3.0662,0.1799,3.5681,5.3299,2.0456,4.82,2.3005,0.0111,0.384,4.2174,1.8086,5.4467,1.2342,5.5106,4.4038,1.4163,5.838,0.7336,2.4663,3.4816,1.984,8.3596,1.4684,0.7491,0.533,2.0769,3.4149,1.7228,5.9487,0.0808,3.3541,2.5928,0.97,0.3665,0.0002,0.7322,1.5468,7.8464,3.1563,0.774,4.8342,1.9242,3.2205,5.4045,2.7341,3.277,8.4747,5.0363,4.2074,1.3638,0.4885,5.1711,2.4535,1.348,5.9911,1.0329,5.3965,2.1355,7.1268,0.7063,3.4667,0.792,4.0232,0.6063,1.6347,2.4828,3.9323,1.4162,6.0143,3.7307,1.9152,4.5879,3.8419,3.8666,2.7646,4.1056,1.6001,0.4449,6.288,0.0045,3.3807,3.1032,0.0108,0.041,0.0059,0.3097,5.1218,2.0207,0.9254,4.6068,1.6859,6.22,0.0397,3.9309,1.7078,3.7691,1.3429,2.7278,0.0221,6.7808,4.8148,0.652,1.5483,4.3677,1.0495,3.4651,6.0975,0.4821,6.4739,6.7385,5.7816,5.6113,2.4226,3.0553,2.7825,8.7601,3.7437,2.3673,3.4189,11.1237,4.3739,5.7823,4.3562,2.4149,3.0628,0.1599,1.7859,0.3596,4.5357,4.1486,1.0899,1.7822,2.9962,1.8906,1.9463,3.903,1.6577,5.346,0.0038,5.5251,2.0079,1.6455,4.349,0.1762,5.3954,0.878,0.7517,2.7169,6.8614,4.1364,2.8242,5.2686,3.0411,9.0694,0.1248,4.1954,5.7023,3.8755,2.0292,3.3811,2.4188,0.9191,0.4822,2.8394,2.9778,2.8006,4.7,0.3499,4.6755,3.5534,0.1946,0.529,0.5818,1.0573,0.0236,1.2811,2.0145,4.6729,0.5844,2.9009,3.5296,0.1692,3.4955,6.395,0.961,0.0004,0.0236,5.6247,2.1427,0.6379,1.2752,0.0009,1.2966,1.124,3.3426,4.9481,0.6389,1.8314,3.847,1.2332,1.5342,4.5706,4.7271,2.8149,0.9375,1.3899,0.6314,2.6,0.535,8.3872,4.8508,0.822,4.3632,5.5984,0.5533,1.7397,7.6012,0.0891,1.446,4.7934,0.0032,1.2326,3.0362,0.3008,1.0838,6.7018,4.2622,2.8485,7.6634,0.1442,0.7021,3.7968,0.466,1.563,0.0025,4.5538,0.9771,1.028,4.5251,0.0054,6.0076,2.063,1.342,8.171,3.4238,1.3352,0.6288,2.556,2.7984,3.5507,8.2596,5.7113,6.851,1.8632,4.8282,0.0044,5.2662,0.2835,1.5506,6.351,6.0957,1.9587,1.5607,6.4154,2.3484,7.2224,1.1491,1.1896,2.8523,0.3882,1.7628,3.5567,4.7748,5.1749,5.6059,1.0862,1.724,0.8747,2.7334,4.058,3.918,1.3076,2.917,5.8119,6.4852,4.1248,0.8168,1.4065,0.5212,0.1464,0.2202,5.66,13.9816,5.0758,3.1737,4.7426,1.9297,0.061,0.7787,3.7274,0.4021,4.1451,1.5327,1.5598,4.7526,0.4527,0.1847,0.8864,4.3817,0.0035,3.3467,0.8756,2.4723,0.6659,1.318,3.9756,1.154,3.6232,2.4063,1.4452,3.6491,4.7858,6.355,2.4317,2.4322,3.0879,2.4857,5.0277,0.0276,0.2108,1.5711,1.9951,0.2437,1.2389,2.5281,0.6802,0.6009,3.9658,0.4208,1.0799,3.5945,0.0178,0.3298,1.6715,1.3846,2.4262,0.346,2.2259,1.1286,3.0374,2.1085,4.0145,4.166,1.5466,3.8811,2.6311,0.7639,0.2028,6.6639,5.1544,3.0559,1.2271,1.6752,5.9797,1.4696,2.1332,0.5345,0.5222,1.86,3.3101,0.8238,2.4378,2.0235,3.3438,2.9168,2.2878,0.9012,2.9749,3.4938,0.2176,7.2275,0.1625,3.8019,4.9671,2.2829,2.2047,3.2314,0.3272,4.2981,0.8296,0.1344,2.4824,0.3101,5.2352,5.3797,2.8993,6.0525,0.6399,2.8363,0.0158,1.4356,1.6972,3.4739,5.4689,3.1892,0.8237,3.393,0.2493,3.2004,4.7884,1.2559,5.1397,0.0558,0.4065,1.17,0.011,4.9655,1.2769,4.2134,2.1944,3.0627,1.508,0.3025,4.6709,0.0009,1.3827,0.442,2.4986,2.3861,0.195,4.5629,2.5118,0.9153,5.6577,3.127,1.7097,3.8029,2.4706,3.4901,1.7553,1.1161,6.0901,6.1479,0.2392,0.3982,4.9149,0.3712,1.1995,5.7545,6.6354,2.1785,1.6375,3.7428,0.0892,1.7108,1.7636,1.2437,5.0888,1.9011,4.0832,4.3171,3.3567,4.6077,2.8025,0.8379,1.4996,3.5454,4.7036,0.0014,5.7263,2.2667,1.2722,4.2416,0.0853,4.0641,2.2193,1.3754,0.6614,0.0985,0.7236,0.9453,0.4695,2.0983,6.5403,5.2516,0.0575,0.8316,2.0882,0.0182,1.501,0.4192,1.7891,3.5732,3.5973,8.8886,4.3488,2.1629,2.7842,3.6485,0.3508,1.5933,3.7643,2.7611,1.5893,1.116,1.6468,0.0036,1.1268,1.3537,1.9691,3.3513,4.4891,1.5683,0.993,0.9526,5.8454,2.063,7.1071,1.5735,0.6753,0.4214,2.4803,1.0063,1.4457,0.5556,0.5238,2.7976,2.7724,1.4286,3.7267,5.469,1.9767,3.4144,3.2621,0.7426,2.3316,8.8604,6.3292,2.378,1.9152,0.4127,3.8527,1.5375,0.5013,0.2676,0.0217,3.3072,2.9135,2.3354,1.1079,0.0893,1.1195,1.895,0.5102,2.9898,1.1529,2.0535,1.6477,2.6935,3.1264,2.3103,0.3696,0.3278,1.7774,1.7089,0.7953,4.3187,2.5193,0.692,1.1269,4.9973,1.456,0.7587,3.1576,0.1552,2.307,0.5602,0.9368,4.5878,2.1363,2.0307,0.683,0.854,6.5729,0.7816,4.2867,2.1866,2.4105,0.0842,1.2287,0.485,0.2211,0.9208,4.8282,0.0066,11.0695,6.941

{"prompt":"The White House is willing to consider a small increase on the corporate tax rate if it is needed to finalize the bill in the U.S. Congress , White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said","text":"The White House is willing to consider a small increase on the corporate tax rate if it is needed to finalize the bill in the U.S. Congress, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said last week.\nAs we have already said at several points over the years, what will determine the rate under the deal is primarily whether the UK and EU agree. We\u2019re not talking about a two-year rate decrease, but about something quite different, said Mulvaney.\nIn the US, it was raised to 33.33% and in the UK, from 20% to 28%, while in the EU, it has only been increased to 30.5%, said Mulvaney. But it should be noted that some EU countries have already made tax increases: Belgium, where it was raised to 26%, and Greece, where it was increased to 37%.\nWhen speaking to reporters on the Senate floor, Republican Senator John Thune (R-SD) argued that it would be wise for the EU to take this increased rate increase, which the EU member states would implement individually. \u201cIf the EU wants to keep the European Economic Area, then the EU should take it,\u201d said Thune.\nHe emphasized that taxes are the major source of revenue and the EU also needs tax revenue \u201cfrom their big business.\u201d\nWith taxes, we need an increase, not a decrease, and I think it's important to put that out there, Mr. Thune said. \u201cIt sounds like a very interesting idea,\u201d said Thunes: \u201cIt sounds like we need to discuss it further and see if we can do that.\u201d\nThe Republicans have already argued against the plan and many Democratic Senators have criticized it also. However, even a few Republicans on the Senate floor have praised it:\nBut a good, strong tax system is critical for maintaining healthy economies, creating jobs, providing for our elderly and other taxpayers who benefit from our growing economy.\nIt is the primary source of revenue for our federal government and it is a major source of tax revenue for our taxpayers who rely on federal income tax revenue, I think this is a very important subject that needs to be fully discussed with all senators, said Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).\nWhile Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), who was one of those with a positive opinion on it, did not believe it should be included.\nI think this is a reasonable proposal, and I look forward to its discussion, but I think the EU is going to argue that this is an intrusion into their own internal matters, said Senator Kaine. The UK and EU need to determine how this is going to be implemented, which is the key, especially since they also need the EU Commission\u2019s approval to be implemented.\nIf the EU wants to increase their tax rate, then they can do it themselves, I think its an argument we will need to counter there, said Kaine.\nIn a statement to The Hill, Trump\u2019s senior adviser Stephen Miller said that his administration is ready to meet with EU officials about an issue that Trump has mentioned several times. He noted that in the meantime, the administration is waiting to see if the UK and EU can reach an agreement on Brexit.\n\u201cThe president supports a more attractive rate for European companies in the United States,\u201d Miller said.\nThis is exactly what the Trump administration wanted. But if the EU could not agree on an increase in the corporate tax rate, the administration would only be able to implement it on a bilateral basis. It means that companies such as Tesla, Google, Apple, and many others would face additional corporate tax burden, and also countries such as Belgium and other European countries would be able to implement it on a bilateral

{"prompt":"The revolving door at the Trump White House was ready to spin again as senior administration officials said on Thursday there is a plan to replace U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Central Intelligence","text":"The revolving door at the Trump White House was ready to spin again as senior administration officials said on Thursday there is a plan to replace U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Central Intelligence Agency chief Mike Pompeo in the first to second week of March but there is no timetable on how much time will be allotted for him to prepare to take over.\nTrump himself has also put the CIA chief on blast on several occasions for the alleged abuse of power. He has questioned and tried to dismiss the agency\u2019s claims about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, in which Trump lost to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nEarlier in the day, Pompeo expressed regret that Tillerson resigned and the departure might leave room to consider the possibility of replacing him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we gave Rex an opportunity to do his job,\u201d Pompeo said after meeting with Republican congressional officials, some of whom have suggested the move, and former CIA director John Brennan.\nOn this day in 2016, he\u2019s going to be in office for 20 hours in this town: \u201cThat\u2019s when the big stuff happens\u201d\nI could actually hear him thinking, this is like a job interview, and he just said to them, \u201cOkay, the only thing the president needs to know, is that I get it. I\u2019ll get it. I understand all about how people work. He doesn\u2019t want a headache for the next two years, so, he needs to know that I give a shit.\u201d\nAnd then maybe a little later on in the conference call, he\u2019d added in an additional, and unguarded disclosure: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a headache for the next two years, so, he needs to know that I never give a shit.\u201d\nWell, it came out at length when the Washington Post broke in on a conference call \u2014 and the people who\u2019re asking the questions seem far more concerned about Trump\u2019s \u201cheadache for the next two years, so, he needs to know that I get it. I\u2019ll get it\u201d approach, than the alleged abuse of power and other issues that have reportedly caused an uproar within Trump\u2019s administration.\nSpeaking out today has been both Mike Pompeo and a former DNI named Bob Woods, and of course, former National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, who was a very close confidante of Trump and one who was probably the primary person in the administration he most trusted.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s story says the transition would be done privately and the public would not be briefed about it for at least another month. No one knows exactly when the transition would begin, but the administration\u2019s top aides are believed to have determined that it would start a week or two after the inauguration, which is next Wednesday. This, of course, is a long time in government, with an administration that just moved to more of the traditional two-year cycle than was typical of U.S. administrations before Trump.\nIt\u2019s also another indication that he\u2019s making a push for being a full-time president. He\u2019s already talked about wanting to be an 80-hour-per-day president for the first 100 days. That\u2019s probably far larger than anything any president has done in his entire career \u2014 except maybe Barack Obama who was also a former Massachusetts governor, and was also a former businessman.\nKissingerver, of course, was also the president\u2019s special adviser to the administration from 1993 to 2001, and he was also a close and trusted confidant. On Thursday, he told CNN that he has no reason to believe that Trump is a different person now than he was back

{"prompt":"Chile s presidential hopefuls ended their campaigns in downtown Santiago on Thursday ahead of an uncertain runoff election whose outcome will determine whether the world s top copper producer turns to the right or maintains","text":"Chile s presidential hopefuls ended their campaigns in downtown Santiago on Thursday ahead of an uncertain runoff election whose outcome will determine whether the world s top copper producer turns to the right or maintains its current left of centre streak.\nLate last week Chile s top court allowed a runoff election after ruling that ballots cast during a general election campaign carried a constitutional bar on them being counted.\nThat vote will determine whether the Chilean Communist Party (PC), which has ruled the country since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship in 1990, or a centrist coalition that has won every election in the last two decades will form the ruling party for the next two years. The two parties had both received nearly 60% of the votes in the last election before the runoff, a result which was due to take place on October 11.\nSome candidates, including presidential hopefuls Jose Miguel Insulza, of the PC, and Alejandro Guillier, of the centrist Progressive Centre (PDC), have criticised the runoff as a step that puts Chile on the path to electoral authoritarianism. The runoff will be fought for across seven regions, with voting on November 22\nVoting is expected to begin at midday on Thursday when the two-party polls began in Santiago and some other cities. The results will be published after 10pm.\nIt is unclear what the results will be a month after the election: as far back as December of last year, polls began to predict that, for the first time, the opposition might not succeed in defeating the current president.\nThe PC, Chile s second largest party and a strong defender of social reforms, aims to take half of the country s seats in the new senate and to remain in parliament. Guillier, the former presidential candidate who beat Insulza in the 2010 contest, could take on a significant role as senator and leader of the country s centre-left opposition.\nIn a sign that Insulza might have a harder ride, the PC, which controls both chambers of the Chilean Congress, was forced to make a pact with a centre-left party, the Democratic Union, headed by a former Socialist Party politician, and the centre-right Freedom Party this month to reach government in order to prevent the re-establishment of the Pinochet dictatorship.\nThe coalition formed the government for about 100 days in the interim between the last elections. But the government did not enjoy much popularity and was forced to submit a new government program to congress.\nInsulza has a lead over Guillier, which could tilt the race in his favour. Insulza, who has not announced his candidacy yet, is one of the most popular presidents since the fall of the dictatorship, a former UN high commissioner and a leading diplomat on human rights issues and multilateral diplomacy. He has a long record of championing social and economic rights, including pension reform, and the protection of labour rights.\nGuillier, a Chilean journalist who has been a political analyst and adviser in Chile, has run as a defender of universal political, social and economic rights. He ran in the presidential race to make a difference during the 2010 election and could be the first centrist to succeed President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era s popularity-boosting reformist governments.\nPi\u00f1era, a businessman now in his eighth year in office, is seen as a potential president by the Chilean people, most of whom favor social reforms. The Chilean president has been the front runner for the election for most of the campaign.\nThe runoff results could also determine the political status of the capital, Chile, the country s economic heartland.

{"prompt":"Greece s junior coalition party leader on Monday faced questioning in parliament and calls for his suspension over a failed deal to sell Greek army missiles to Saudia Arabia . Panos Kammenos , defense minister","text":"Greece s junior coalition party leader on Monday faced questioning in parliament and calls for his suspension over a failed deal to sell Greek army missiles to Saudia Arabia. Panos Kammenos, defense minister in a government dominated by centrists, faced questions over his inability to sell the S-400 air defense missiles system to Turkey after failing to renegotiate the previous deal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had ordered a halt to negotiations for a deal with Greece and Ankara over the sale of those missiles after they were revealed to carry Russian-built cruise missiles capable of hitting targets over Turkey s entire territory. The move has sparked international outrage and raised serious questions over whether Greece is being exploited as a pawn of Mr Erdogan s authoritarian rule. Mr Kammenos, an influential centrist member of Greece s ruling coalition, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In parliament, the leader of Greece s main opposition, leftist Syriza, said he would investigate Mr Kammenos s relationship with Russian diplomats. In a statement to state media, he said, quoting unnamed sources quoting him quoting the prime minister, quoting Putin quoting Mr Kammenos quoting foreign ministry officials quoting him quoting a

{"prompt":"Republicans in U.S. House of Representatives began staking out their positions on final tax legislation on Tuesday , days ahead of talks with the Senate to shape the tax package lawmakers hope to send to","text":"Republicans in U.S. House of Representatives began staking out their positions on final tax legislation on Tuesday, days ahead of talks with the Senate to shape the tax package lawmakers hope to send to President Donald Trump's desk.\nThe Senate is set to vote on its own version of the tax package on Thursday, and then on Wednesday, the House will take care of its own in the final stretch to the November elections. Here is how House lawmakers are positioning themselves ahead of their votes.\nDemocrats may want to include many of the Republican proposal's economic incentives for businesses, with the goal of keeping companies here and encouraging them to hire.\nRepublicans said they will hold off taking up one of the president's most popular measures, which would allow people and businesses to roll over unused Medicare drug costs, until after the midterm elections.\nLawmakers in both parties' camps also are set to push for more financial and personal savings tools.\nThe White House has backed up a proposal to create a $1.5 trillion economic stimulus package, suggesting that at least $1 trillion of that should go toward the $900 billion in personal and federal spending that the Senate and House have proposed.\nRepublicans and Democrats have been trying to reach an accord after more than seven weeks of negotiations and more than 500 deadlines.\n\"Every day and every debate is building our confidence that as American Republicans and Democrats get back to the real work of getting our economy going and building middle class opportunity again, and making sense of tax reform, we will find agreement,\" the White House said Monday.\nIn an effort to get more bipartisan support, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have announced a final package would be introduced simultaneously, with the full Senate returning Friday and the full House Monday.\nDemocratic leaders say Democrats will accept the top line of the package and work on the details in the remaining months ahead of the November elections, which the two sides see as their chance to take control of Washington over the next four years.\nRepublicans don't want to see any new programs introduced after the elections as the next administration takes office and tries to pass legislation in an election year.\nThe White House is also pushing for a deal and for the president next week to deliver on a pledge to spend $4.7 billion of the $1.5 trillion package to expand coverage of people on the lower end of the income spectrum and for those coming out of poverty.\nA White House aide to President Donald Trump said the president is \"committed\" to his promise but he is \"taking a little bit of time to see what everybody else is doing\" before taking any final action.\nThe president would still go ahead with his pledge to send a bill that fully funds the walls he has wanted built along the U.S.-Mexico border, which House Democrats have pushed back on numerous times.\nRep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrat in the House, said Tuesday the administration will deliver on the wall.\n\"I believe we can get very close to something, but with the right legislation, in the right time and so, I believe we can get there,\" Pelosi said.\nDemocrats also have called for a bill that would cut the corporate tax rate to 18 percent, from the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.\nThe House is expected to agree to some elements, which would give businesses a cut to the current 35 percent rate and to create new incentives for hiring, with about $25 billion or more in tax relief, according to congressional aides.\nSome Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have expressed serious doubts that the House could agree to that figure.\nSenate Republicans, who are expected to hold a vote Thursday on their tax package, are pushing a tax rate cut that would give smaller business owners a bigger cut to their income taxes.","token_len":777,"entropy":[3.6707,7.0324,0.0506,0.0093,0.0673,1.6901,0.8332,0.0082,6.685,8.5691,1.8923,0.4971,1.4719,2.6612,1.1656,9.4931,4.4721,2.0688,1.974,1.6834,1.1196,7.3989,3.7677,0.0044,8.1183,1.4459,2.1841,1.8258,1.5982,5.9109,1.368,2.4399,3.199,7.9477,1.9036,0.2462,4.4684,0.1547,1.314,0.7285,0.0084,2.4879,0.0041,0.7415,0.1319,15.4972,3.049,2.4197,2.229,0.036,0.9859,0.3419,3.5,2.2855,1.968,0.0394,0.3333,1.0705,2.9517,1.8728,1.7737,0.5765,1.9278,4.6932,2.6791,3.5928,0.7187,1.7241,0.2259,1.0536,3.116,6.6587,0.0119,2.2612,1.0773,6.4709,1.6429,2.1796,6.6993,4.381,5.0025,3.506,1.7701,0.1979,7.5711,2.7183,2.1386,4.4824,3.3899,2.0669,3.6089,0.9336,4.2748,0.0746,3.2905,3.7123,1.3804,0.6186,17.7689,5.5268,2.8756,0.1984,5.6875,5.6595,0.7345,0.622,4.5802,6.0783,1.1257,6.1907,6.1383,2.9194,2.0926,1.6153,4.5827,2.0409,3.3979,0.0683,3.3767,4.9675,6.0374,1.4673,4.5305,1.2345,0.0295,3.727,2.4989,1.2294,2.9656,5.0753,0.8084,2.3397,4.5205,2.6498,5.721,2.974,5.9181,0.4963,0.3034,6.1557,0.0145,2.5467,2.3839,4.27,0.8114,2.9517,0.8653,3.225,3.4615,4.5013,0.6606,0.2371,7.5738,1.749,8.0107,6.7363,6.6874,1.5765,2.5343,5.4596,1.315,0.6079,3.2425,0.0656,0.3453,0.7767,6.913,0.0033,2.724,1.0497,1.3405,6.6492,4.3986,4.0938,2.5683,5.4774,0.0261,2.6066,0.8335,2.731,5.6131,3.7586,4.4768,3.0074,6.3421,2.373,0.7209,2.3551,2.4886,0.0005,1.5805,6.6476,4.1523,2.9017,2.3979,1.5054,4.752,0.6277,3.427,1.536,0.9296,1.3585,0.0804,5.3427,0.3835,0.5446,1.4573,6.9337,1.3365,5.8636,0.1512,2.1748,1.1283,0.2731,1.8015,1.1355,4.0178,1.4847,0.8765,2.6388,4.3553,4.5336,0.0239,1.1377,5.6227,1.3924,7.5117,3.2685,1.5198,2.4898,3.262,2.9011,0.1339,1.9195,2.663,0.4296,0.5251,3.3695,3.6828,0.835,1.4051,2.2349,2.5038,0.209,3.7147,1.973,4.4946,5.5757,4.3021,0.0087,4.3318,3.5831,0.3631,1.7098,3.7305,3.7923,0.1156,6.6247,8.2119,1.8234,0.8288,3.3438,6.1405,2.2416,5.8339,0.1988,5.7697,1.9874,7.6589,5.8687,3.74,0.9469,6.9031,7.1214,7.6251,2.5705,0.6024,4.3417,3.8905,0.8309,3.5554,6.6676,1.9528,1.0948,3.2041,2.4195,1.7597,2.47,2.6741,4.5292,5.4524,0.8146,7.7453,6.1259,0.2593,5.0875,3.5591,6.1522,0.0383,5.1667,0.5539,0.6247,0.8149,1.691,4.1187,4.5185,1.8407,3.9816,0.7026,0.0008,0.1095,3.7118,0.6314,0.2183,3.7079,3.0546,2.6109,0.0266,2.8325,3.4202,4.2391,0.7571,0.9656,2.8024,1.2879,0.0389,0.029,0.0003,2.507,0.5103,2.2614,0.0084,0.0115,0.0002,1.4336,4.795,1.3998,4.4277,3.123,5.2146,2.1193,3.1661,9.0721,2.4778,1.5639,1.5533,5.5681,0.7092,7.6893,4.5066,2.8459,0.6556,2.5666,0.0127,4.1919,0.3648,0.3753,5.0724,0.9207,2.9337,5.6561,1.5881,6.2925,0.9624,6.8577,5.2914,1.231,0.9188,2.451,2.1397,4.1316,2.9478,2.3513,2.8161,3.4189,1.0885,6.3224,3.3206,5.4952,1.5265,0.7649,1.6643,0.4907,2.028,2.4509,4.5708,5.6769,1.8537,5.8458,0.0443,3.8595,2.7226,0.0824,4.0259,1.7999,0.0744,3.9704,6.0953,0.7347,0.4797,2.1727,0.0636,0.0726,0.2544,2.9441,6.2316,0.0007,1.0195,0.3589,2.945,2.1892,4.3155,7.1885,5.397,3.6487,0.6381,3.8536,4.1355,2.4653,5.0964,3.7959,3.0405,0.5462,2.8045,5.2852,0.0176,2.8634,2.7428,3.4863,4.1986,3.4506,0.0829,0.395,0.5849,2.3086,1.5706,0.0009,2.8058,1.3559,2.4272,0.7022,1.4592,4.5736,5.9896,4.7193,2.2049,4.0063,8.7906,1.43,0.1611,4.1728,1.8484,1.8995,3.4689,0.8419,4.1496,0.8554,3.5867,0.7774,2.4898,2.6957,3.1295,1.1016,0.7411,2.0284,0.2236,0.2531,0.0078,3.9133,2.5756,5.5509,5.9828,2.5269,3.1111,4.7218,2.7047,6.1168,1.5445,0.0197,0.1073,0.1448,0.7768,2.2885,2.8347,4.4493,6.4657,1.8146,0.153,3.1508,0.7938,0.3133,4.4057,2.8483,0.0013,2.9848,6.4596,3.6141,0.7097,0.0082,1.1083,1.4707,1.4538,1.8834,2.0358,4.3587,0.092,0.6459,0.0592,4.6331,2.7135,5.6542,3.6714,2.7949,2.0818,5.2652,1.4927,4.2831,1.2964,0.3598,0.6837,1.4474,3.9362,1.0819,7.0217,2.0579,0.3829,0.9837,2.6287,2.748,3.3674,1.8945,1.9987,0.9417,0.4388,0.2214,1.6857,2.8282,4.9401,4.3442,6.2715,1.9585,0.3444,1.9741,3.6456,1.0898,5.0209,3.0565,4.0528,4.1868,7.9122,2.2655,0.7204,11.7609,4.7709,2.0854,6.5261,4.0799,2.5808,0.3551,1.1895,0.0005,0.0017,0.2684,0.086,0.0021,1.6987,2.4463,5.3243,2.3007,1.3789,3.7247,2.823,1.0199,8.2378,0.3409,0.6873,0.5516,5.9276,0.0887,5.0877,0.0018,1.9137,0.0145,0.7368,0.7937,0.5449,0.2464,2.3862,0.0821,0.0765,0.4808,0.6623,3.3796,2.6024,3.0051,2.5877,5.5001,0.6173,1.3269,2.2393,2.3524,0.4463,0.4735,1.8511,3.2552,1.7933,2.3053,2.1002,6.4128,0.4541,0.3173,5.3904,3.5295,1.4121,5.506,1.4272,4.2323,4.0113,0.8364,5.2899,1.2573,0.5791,1.3545,2.0255,7.2964,5.4745,1.3934,1.8269,0.7866,0.4052,0.8793,2.5939,0.4041,0.8951,0.1849,0.7825,0.4195,3.4,3.1877,2.0771,4.1512,0.3287,1.2012,4.8918,1.1014,0.5807,3.9684,1.6723,2.3362,0.1601,0.0417,1.6164,4.6386,0.1999,1.8107,3.6886,3.8166,0.1007,6.5629,3.2539,0.0642,0.078,1.9143,0.0433,0.7551,0.8275,1.6532,2.1434,2.6348,1.3483,0.0083,5.0828,0.7501,4.4941,5.9889,4.3338,4.8535,1.9937,3.5911,3.4637,1.77,2.7143,2.5744,4.2938,5.4086,2.7324,0.0589,1.3649,2.8126,4.421,5.1213,2.8156,2.1702,0.7765,4.2808,2.3913,3.515,4.9444,0.4794,4.579,0.0662,6.8766,1.4469,1.3456,2.1832,2.6088,3.5403,2.063,0.0008,4.1538,1.2502,0.4143,0.3385,4.053,1.9842,1.9346,0.8312,1.3254,2.1339

Pompeo, has been praised for his work on foreign affairs.\nIn a memorandum that became public Friday, Trump \u2019 s national security adviser, John Bolton, writes that Pompeo has been \u201ca most dedicated professional and personal friend\u201d and \u201can exceptional diplomat.\u201d\n\u201cThe United Nations was the crux of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy aspirations and it continues to be the central component of his administration.\u201d\nPompeo has been a staunch defender of Israel and is known across the political spectrum in the U.S. as someone who\u2019s been an unwavering critic of Iran.\nHe is Trump\u2019s pick to spearhead an effort to return the U.S. to the Iran nuclear agreement, and he has defended the president\u2019s decision to cut U.S. funding to the U.N. health agency that is supposed to provide services for people who are victims of disease around the world.\nThe role that the U.N. has played throughout Trump\u2019s presidency has played an important role in his own popularity.\nThe president has touted his support for multilateralism and has made the U.N. a target for his critics because of a number of its shortcomings, including alleged violations of human rights. But his support for the UN has been so strong that his administration has attempted to work with the United Nations, while others might have wanted to shut the organization down.\nTrump has made national security the top priority of his presidency, and in his role as commander-in-chief he can veto any of the bills that are presented to his Cabinet for approval.\nFor those who were initially skeptical about Trump wanting to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord, Bolton said in his memo that Pompeo \u201cpromotes a bipartisan Iran solution, working most strongly with congressional leaders.\u201d\nThe memo also talks about another major focus of Trump \u2019 s administration - North Korea - where Bolton says Pompeo and others \u201chave consistently identified North Korea as the most pressing threat to U.S. national security.\u201d\nHe also writes that, as the U.S. ambassador, Pompeo has \u201cprovided a steady hand to senior administration officials.\u201d\nThe secretary of state, Rex Tillerson left office this year after being criticized for the U.N. appointment of Mike Pompeo.\nHowever, he said that Pompeo has proven himself to be \u201can outstanding and dedicated professional, and an exceptional diplomat.\u201d\nTrump, said, \u201chas demonstrated a singular focus on national security and the promotion of American interests, both domestic and abroad.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cHe has provided consistent leadership and guidance to senior U.S. national security officials, and with his colleagues overseas, has promoted national security for America and the global community.\u201d\nTrump, who has accused Iran of trying to develop its nuclear weapons program, has repeatedly called for a return to the Iran nuclear agreement, but it has been subject to threats to be reintroduced to Trump\u2019s final days as president.\nThe Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed between the United States and Iran in July

{"prompt":"The leader of Italy s far-right Northern League said on Thursday he was suspending contacts with his main political ally , former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , because of a disagreement over how tough courts","text":"The leader of Italy s far-right Northern League said on Thursday he was suspending contacts with his main political ally, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, because of a disagreement over how tough courts should be on bankers suspected of corruption. In an apparent show of power, the Northern League said Mr. Berlusconi s centre-left People of Freedom party had withdrawn from a planned pact to form a grand coalition government. Mr. Berlusconi s party was once a key partner in coalition governments, but has long rejected cooperation with the League and other far-left forces. In his own bid for power back in 2006, Mr. Berlusconi s party formed a coalition with the League, which had been part of the Italian center-left opposition. There have been several disputes about a ruling s attitude to cases of corruption in Italy. In March, two years of investigations into criminal graft at the Bank of Italy led to the ousting of then- Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and an arrest warrant for Mr. Berlusconi s chief of staff. But during a public trial, last year, it was decided that the bankers would not be punished because the case would be the subject of a political discussion. Meanwhile, the bankers who were caught in the graft cases have appealed to both the Supreme Court and the European Commission against the ruling. The Justice Ministry told The Associated Press Tuesday it was continuing to investigate whether the Bank of Italy had violated Italy s anti-corruption laws. A source close to the case told The Associated Press it had been decided that no criminal charges would be brought against the officials at the Bank of Italy, in the graft probe. If confirmed, the decision would be a blow to Mr. Berlusconi s government, which would be blamed for turning a blind eye to the scandal at the head of the largest bank in Italy and using that to weaken Mr. Berlusconi s position by saying that it has a weak prosecutor. In addition, Mr. Berlusconi was one of the chief proponents of the anti-corruption laws in Italy. The source said the source said Mr. Berlusconi was upset at what he called an abuse of discretion by Judge Andrea Bonaiuti, who investigated Bank of Italy activities by obtaining information from outside the bank. Mr. Berlusconi also said he suspected the judge s sister, who is married to a former Bank of Italy chief, to have acted improperly. Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Padoan were both ousted as finance ministers over the cases against the Bank of Italy. The bankers caught in the graft cases are under house arrest. Mr. Berlusconi said Wednesday the case against the bankers was part of a revenge plot to try to weaken him ahead of elections due next April. Mr. Berlusconi, who entered politics after the war to become the country s first communists to win a national office, won in 2000 and 2004 with a campaign against the graft prosecutors. Since his ousting by the anti-graft prosecutors in March a year ago, Mr. Berlusconi and his party have faced several scandals, and he has lost support. The European Commission, a European institution that oversees the rule of law, said in August that it was considering Mr. Berlusconi s government s compliance with EU state aid rules and national anti-corruption laws. Mr. Berlusconi says his party is no longer part of a government with the Left. Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Padoan have been accused by the prosecutor s office of misusing state funds in buying out government bonds to pay for a sports center. If convicted of the charges, they could face up to 20 years in jail.

{"prompt":"A country s right to choose its own development path must be respected , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Venezuelan counterpart on Friday , offering support for the strife-torn Latin American nation .","text":"A country s right to choose its own development path must be respected, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Venezuelan counterpart on Friday, offering support for the strife-torn Latin American nation. Venezuela is under pressure from a host of international sanctions over its economic difficulties, and President Nicolas Maduro is expected to take on a fourth term as opposition forces try to oust him. Wang, the visiting guest of honor to Caracas, spoke to his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza after attending a state visit led by Bolivian President Evo Morales in Caracas late on Thursday. Asked about Maduro s efforts to extend his four term tenure, Wang stressed that any development model should be respected. He told Reuters at a news conference that it cannot be said simply that foreign economic assistance will not be provided because of Maduro s plans to run for a fourth term. The visit is expected to boost ties between the two governments. But the tensions in Venezuela and China s growing ties with Cuba could complicate matters, analysts say. China has offered to provide Venezuela with oil and other raw materials, while Cuba is its largest investor. Other governments have also voiced their reservations. The Organization of American States ( OAS ) has called on Maduro s allies to seek another path, while France and Canada say they are preparing to take a similar stance, citing concerns that Maduro is trying to consolidate his grip on power through illegitimate actions. China, Maduro s ally, also has been pushing him to step aside, and Beijing has shown interest in Venezuela s oil industry, which has faced serious difficulties in recent decades. At a time when Venezuela has become more dependent on Venezuela s domestic economy, a weakening economy led by Maduro would put the country s political and economic stability at risk, according to a report by The National Interest group. At a press conference on Friday, Maduro said that China s offer to supply oil and other raw materials to Venezuela is to be seen not as a favor. Maduro added that he would not seek to extend his four year term. The Venezuelan president stressed that if international sanctions were lifted, he would start negotiations over a new constitutional amendment that would end his tenure. Maduro said that Maduro s predecessor, Chavez, had planned for a presidential third term, but the opposition stopped him in his tracks. The Venezuelan opposition had earlier accused Maduro of rigging the election to prevent his re-election. The election was called three weeks ago, after opposition leader Henrique Capriles ran into problems in trying to run for president. The opposition, supported by the US, seeks to persuade Maduro to step aside. The US last week added Maduro to its list of sanctioned individuals, and this month asked its allies not to recognize the results of the election. Maduro accused the US of targeting human rights violations in Venezuela that resulted in the murder of more than 100 people. In September last year, he said that as a counter to pressure by the US, the Venezuelan government planned to open a diplomatic channel with Russia. It has also extended diplomatic ties with Cuba, saying the decision will further strengthen human rights and democratic standards of the country. China s official Foreign Ministry on Friday said that it took note of US decision to support opposition groups to oust Maduro. Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular briefing that China s decision was aimed at keeping peace and stability in Venezuela. China s foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment on Maduro s comments. Maduro has previously said he will seek a fourth term in office and has also said that he is committed to meeting the needs of Venezuelan people. But his government has faced economic difficulties related to a sharp drop in oil prices, as well as increased unemployment.

{"prompt":"The Belgian trial of a key suspect in the November 2015 Islamic State attack on Paris was postponed on Monday for seven weeks , after Saleh Abdeslam s newly appointed lawyer asked for more time","text":"The Belgian trial of a key suspect in the November 2015 Islamic State attack on Paris was postponed on Monday for seven weeks, after Saleh Abdeslam s newly appointed lawyer asked for more time. Abdeslam s parents and brother had accused Belgium s prosecutors of incompetence, saying the man has no alibi for the attacks. Belgium s defence minister, Geert Bourgeois, said the new delay was necessary in order to give the accused s lawyers ample time for preparation before the new trial begins. Abdeslam s lawyers asked to be allowed as long as three and a half years. A prosecutor at the Brussels court, Me Alain A\u00efssani, said the delay was not unusual and justified by the complexity of the case. The attack on Paris killed 130 people and caused major disruption to transport networks following the coordinated murder of French police officers during the shooting rampage. In September 2018, Abdeslam turned himself in to French police in Antwerp after fleeing the Saint-Denis police headquarters under fire in the weeks leading up to the attacks, after which he was arrested and later extradited to Belgium. A few months later, on December 24, he was linked by French investigators with a bomb attack that hit British troops near Paris. Belgian authorities later said they had evidence that Abdeslam stayed at the Belgian side of the border following the shooting and that he had aided other Islamic State fighters. Prosecutors in several European jurisdictions have said they plan to bring all the men involved in the attacks against France and the British forces, including Abdeslam, to court. The men, who include three Frenchmen who were arrested with Abdeslam, have not been linked directly to any of the attacks. French police searched a number of cities and neighbourhoods in Belgium on various occasions in recent months without discovering the group either in France or in Belgium. A search of Abdeslam s home in the eastern Belgian city of Forest came to nothing earlier this year.\nThe UN Human Rights Council Thursday adopted a new resolution aimed at combating religious intolerance, which, according to diplomats, reflects calls by the United Arab Emirates. The EU, China, Russia and the United States abstained, as did India. Speaking during the vote, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, condemned \u201call forms of intolerance and incitement to hatred. \u201d She told Council members that religious discrimination and threats towards religious minorities \u201caren\u2019t welcome in a global era in which religions come in all the colors of the rainbow. \u201d Speaking in her capacity as UN High Commissioner for Human rights, Bachelet said \u201cthe protection of religious freedom must be seen as a basic tool to reduce the tension and conflicts that have taken place in different parts of the world.\u201d\nThe Islamic State on Sunday published a series of audio clips showing the group s leaders making calls for Muslims to wage an all-out jihad against the infidels. The clips were posted on social media by the jihadist network s mouthpiece al-Jazeera, quoting an unspecified number of members of the Islamic State s supreme leadership who allegedly discussed fighting against the infidels, who they accuse of engaging in blasphemy and apostasy. In the videos the group s leaders were heard saying that the infidels, who they called the disbelievers, had blasphemed God and the prophet Mohammed, and that they deserve \u201cthe wrath and the fire. \u201d The video calls all Muslims to stand up against the infidels. A spokesman for the US Department of State said that he s concerned by what he heard from the jihadists.

{"prompt":"Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday likely gained ground ahead of national elections next year when the Court of Appeal ruled that the Election Commission can go ahead with a controversial redrawing of voting","text":"Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday likely gained ground ahead of national elections next year when the Court of Appeal ruled that the Election Commission can go ahead with a controversial redrawing of voting districts.\nElection commission spokesman Wan Ismail said that the case, heard on Tuesday (Oct 2) in Kuala Lumpur, followed another recent legal decision by the court to allow the extension of the nomination deadline because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe court's ruling lifted a two-day temporary injunction granted by the Election Tribunal on September 21, the eve of the extension.\nWan Ismail said judges found the EEC had \"completely adhered to the laws\" when it extended the deadline despite the court finding they could make a request to do so.\nIn their ruling, the court also noted that the EEC's attempt to redraw certain constituencies violated the Election (Amendment) Act 2012 and could not do so under the Constitution.\nThe court found that the redrawing could affect the results of certain constituencies and it would be \"very difficult\" to prove if the EEC had acted lawfully in such a matter.\nThat was because some voters in those constituencies could be affected by the new boundaries, although the EEC maintained it respected the boundaries in law.\n\"It is our respect and appreciation towards the Supreme Court for taking this matter very seriously and taking an action that can benefit the country in general,\" said Wan Ismail.\n\"In this case, this Court has acknowledged and accepted that the Ministry of Home Affairs has already appointed the committee to redraw the voting districts as per the decision of the Supreme Court,\" he added.\nHe said the EEC had applied to the court for an immediate injunction to overturn its earlier order on the redrawing before the court's latest decision on extended the deadline to Monday, Oct 7.\nHowever, the court refused to do so, saying there is no urgency for the EEC to act because the court had the option of doing so.\n\"... this Court would like this matter to be resolved as soon as possible and at the earliest after this court makes its final decision. Such an action would be more beneficial to the nation,\" said the spokesman.\nThe EEC had applied to the court after it was ordered to implement the Supreme Court's ruling on the redrawing of voting districts amid calls for fair representation of the majority Malay community in Kuala Lumpur by the Malaysian Bar Association, Muslim Associations and even political candidates.\nA few months ago, some Malaysian candidates had objected to being drawn out from the state where they lived to be replaced with members of the same communities.\nA total of 1,600,000 voters are to be affected by the new election map, which will affect some 21 seats, the majority of which are held by the opposition Democratic Action Party and Parti Islam SeMalaysia.\nThe EEC also wants to expand the number of Malaysian citizens who are registered voters. A voter is only eligible if the voter has lived in Malaysia for more than three years and has been a citizen for five years.\nThe Malaysian Bar Association and other political parties have said the move represents an attempt to favour the Muslim community ahead of the polls.\nThe EEC, in its application, said that some Malay voters in KL and Kelantan could be affected by the new boundaries under the new map and therefore object to the move.\nThe EEC was earlier fined RM500,000 (S$167,000) for the violation of Election Act after it failed to implement the court's order to redraw the

{"prompt":"Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again to repeal and replace the law this year , House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday","text":"Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again to repeal and replace the law this year, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday. In another sign that some in Congress think the administration\u2019s budget plan is too expensive, House Republicans agreed to not fund the National Institutes of Health without a separate $14 billion increase. But if the Democratic-controlled Senate passes the budget proposal, House Republicans may not take up a proposal to strengthen Obamacare. Some lawmakers who opposed Obamacare\u2019s consumer protections in the previous year have become more supportive, with Sens.\nTrump is going to a lot of ground but will he be successful in getting the majority of the US to accept an Affordable Care Act that the rest of the world is going to take notice of in their own healthcare policies. President Donald Trump and the administration had little to do with the bill but that is unlikely to change as the new administration begins. The Republicans have already shown they are not inclined to support some of the elements of the ACA and the Democratic Party has signaled that it may veto the bill which is unlikely to happen with the new administration.\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told CNN that while he has a \u201cvery different\u201d strategy than that of President Trump on health care, it is clear that the Republican President supports the health care proposal of his former colleagues. President Trump has suggested that he will not accept the new law or \u201cfundamentally\u201d change the law but he has yet to say whether he would like to see the plan repealed. The President has said he will be more aggressive in taking down or repealing the law after the election.\nIt is clear that the Republicans and some in the Obama Administration are very unhappy with the law and if the President supports a repeal and replace then the Republican Party may do likewise. With millions of people facing cuts from the existing health care law or being pushed to the insurance exchanges the Republicans may not support the new law.\nIn the meantime the new President and administration has little to do with the health care law except for maybe the issue of insurance. President Trump has said he does not support the current system. The new administration does not really have much power to change the law through executive order. Most congressional Republicans see the law as a good step forward although there are some that would like it to be stronger.\nFor months the president has been pushing for changes in the law and even suggested that his former colleagues wouldn\u2019t be happy with it and would want it changed. It doesn\u2019t appear his comments that he will not accept the new law and there is little chance he will as it is unlikely that he would consider a repeal and replace which it appears will be what he does and does not support. The President has come out in opposition to the bill because of its ability to increase government spending and cut taxes for the wealthy. While he doesn\u2019t support the current law the President does not have that much power to do anything to change it nor do most in congress.\nIt is a little unclear which direction the GOP and the President will go after the election especially as it is becoming more clear that the Republicans are looking to support policies which take away some benefits from people insured through this new law. If anyone can make a change it appears the GOP has not yet and it is unlikely any would take place through executive orders.\nIn some ways this plan will be similar in nature to the Clinton administration\u2019s plan and it certainly appears to have some similar goals. President Trump wants some major changes but he has a limited ability to do so through executive order. The Republicans in congress have been reluctant to support this plan and if the President and the Republican Party support the current law at the expense of some people not being able to get coverage they may have their reasons for doing

The four suspects , aged between","text":"German police investigating four people suspected of planning an Islamist-motivated attack raided nine locations in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt on Thursday, prosecutors said. The four suspects, aged between 18 and 29 years, were arrested while trying to buy guns to carry out the attack, the prosecutors said. Four of those arrested on Thursday had been deported from the country at the end of September, with the others having been there for a month to a year. The arrests also involved three people, including a second German suspected of being radicalized by Islamist propaganda, the prosecutors said. The prosecutor\u2019s official website cited police reports that among the suspects arrested was a Muslim woman and a radicalized Christian man. The police had also detained a man they suspected of planning an attack. In total, ten people had been arrested on suspicion of attempting to purchase weapons. Three men, three women, and three children were charged with carrying out a crime, the prosecutors said. The arrests took place near the city\u2019s main railway hub, on Brandenburg Gate\u2019s promenade in Spandau, and were part of an investigation targeting the use of weapons in jihadist-inspired attacks. One of the arrested \u2013 a 22-year-old Briton \u2013 had previously worked in North Africa. The prosecutor\u2019s official website said that the people arrested planned to join terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State ( IS ) in Iraq and Syria. But the police were not able to identify those who had been radicalised. An investigation that began in September 2014 had shown that the first and third arrests had attended lectures of a \u201c radical preacher \u201d, an organizer of Islamic gatherings at various refugee camps in Germany. \u201cThe statements that the men and women made in these two examples do not qualify as radicalisation. They have nothing to do with terror, \u201d says prosecutor Daniel Weckert. The prosecutor said on Thursday that a total of eight people suspected of supporting the suspects were arrested, and that eight other suspects were being questioned. Most of the arrested suspects lived in the city neighbourhood of Mitte, but one of the four arrested in Spandau attended a conference on terrorism in Leipzig. Prosecutors said they were unable to provide a clear timeline for how the four who were arrested near the Brandenburg Gate planned to carry out an attack. Prosecutors were considering the possibility of bringing these four charges of attempting to commit a crime and conspiracy to commit terrorism, along with charges of possession of material intended for committing an offence, the police sources told Reuters. Two other suspects in these four cases are being held on a police detention order, prosecutors said. A fifth, who was arrested in Berlin with a bomb on him, is being held on an order of protection, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Police also seized two motorcycles, three guns, and 13 Molotov cocktails, it said. Investigations had found that some of the arrested people had been radicalised by jihadism. Sources close to the probe said that one of the men arrested had been radicalised by jihadist materials on a computer, one of the sources said. \u201c He had visited countries with a history of radicalisation, which is in line with other investigations that had shown that jihadist materials had reached Germany and other European countries, \u201d a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters. The investigation had focused on three families whose background members were seen to have carried out terrorist attacks. One of the men arrested had worked in the refugee camps in Germany, where he had interacted with a radical preacher, sources close to the investigation have told Reuters.

{"prompt":"Pope Francis strongly defended immigrants at his Christmas Eve Mass on Sunday , comparing them to Mary and Joseph finding no place to stay in Bethlehem and saying faith demands that foreigners be welcomed .","text":"Pope Francis strongly defended immigrants at his Christmas Eve Mass on Sunday, comparing them to Mary and Joseph finding no place to stay in Bethlehem and saying faith demands that foreigners be welcomed.He gave many examples of immigrants in his homily from the Bible, saying that Jesus, the man born on Christmas Eve, saw more than one place where someone couldn't sleep at night, and they were just as welcome as those who wanted to stay in their town's homes.\n\"This is God's way. This is a matter that is central to faith,\" Francis said. \"(I)f we think simply about our own culture, we are always afraid to receive a stranger in our village. What if I'm a refugee? What if I'm not from God?\" He then cited stories from the Bible: the Angel Gabriel visits Mary and warns her of what is to come, but she remains at peace. Joseph has no place to stay because Mary cannot get away from those who are looking for her son.\nThe Pope also referred to Francis who told a group of migrants when he arrived in Castel Gandolfo on Christmas Eve, \"We are coming from the same house of Mary and Joseph. Mary and Joseph's house is the house of Jesus Christ: he is a stranger, but he is no stranger (because) he is born in our culture in the house of a family that would not have welcomed him as a son,\" the Pope noted. \"We are the children of Mary and Joseph, and we have something that is precious to us, and he is not a stranger (because) he says himself: 'Blessed are you, sir!' \"\nFrancis then said that as Christians, we do not have to apologize for Jesus being born in Bethlehem, and we can and should give Christians, who are suffering from religious persecutions, a place to stay. \"For us, those who love God, every place, every culture is worth something. He is born in your house, and he's a stranger, but he is also your father, and your God,\" he said in Italian.\nIn his homily, Benedict referred directly to Francis on several occasions. Benedict asked him, \"If Jesus had the privilege of your birthplace, would he have the same privilege today, would he have enjoyed the same rights?\" The Pope said he would think it would, but that many of the people he met were not so sure.\nBenedict also asked Francis, \"How would you take the suggestion that all the countries of the world celebrate Christmas today?\" The Pope gave a short answer, a smiling smile that said, \"That won't really happen. It probably wouldn't happen because of the wars between countries. If that weren't the case, it wouldn't be so important.\"\n\"Your church has its tradition,\" Benedict said about those traditions. \"We may not always agree, but (we) share our traditions. Are we not like brothers who pray together, even without sharing the same faith?\" Benedict asked.\nFrancis gave one answer on the question. \"A little boy in a remote village, perhaps a child who cannot read, who learns this language in which we speak and understand each other, and he doesn't know what it means, but he can say a prayer to his Father, to God, with respect, and in the language of love that he knows,\" Francis said.\n\"It is wonderful that, in any place, every culture, there is a little village where we can see a child who is not a child anymore, who is already a man,\" the Pope said. \"It is wonderful that somewhere in the world, especially in the Middle East, there is someone who is calling out to God for a little village, with a little church where they can pray, share their suffering, so that the violence does not spread, so that there is peace.\"","token_len":786,"entropy":[8.7383,9.6817,3.4019,7.3274,4.6531,3.1638,6.288,3.6219,1.992,3.4594,1.5564,0.9387,6.8014,0.6971,0.0664,9.6611,2.2164,3.1755,11.542,7.5447,2.3971,1.7719,2.8794,1.811,5.6835,3.4337,2.8288,8.3045,6.7505,1.6497,6.9655,2.0252,2.8445,1.1985,8.5853,6.0931,5.8326,1.462,0.3784,2.5176,3.202,2.0165,5.1469,0.5466,5.3258,1.4159,6.3652,1.1474,1.938,1.2661,3.1703,3.6805,2.1458,5.8957,4.7312,3.8845,3.5126,0.7091,0.2447,5.3354,5.7851,1.1249,2.2474,3.0255,3.7909,5.5564,6.132,0.0005,5.6342,4.1124,0.1121,1.8869,1.2994,4.9985,1.6406,5.5107,2.5639,1.6574,1.0064,3.1102,0.7687,5.7608,0.1955,1.3354,1.2754,2.1935,6.634,5.5176,4.3994,0.2701,2.6774,8.8613,3.8875,0.656,5.037,0.1413,2.774,3.5113,2.0097,0.081,3.171,5.1405,3.1501,2.2368,4.9419,0.1448,5.3105,1.1973,1.6423,0.23,0.6637,7.1718,3.6594,1.0003,1.7132,1.9487,4.9907,9.4381,2.8399,3.3448,1.9584,4.5544,0.7335,1.2557,1.6782,5.2711,6.7059,1.4884,7.9553,2.733,4.2252,3.0996,0.8924,5.3074,1.3123,5.1483,3.193,3.7729,3.5081,2.5525,3.8952,2.2309,0.8091,0.0347,0.4858,0.5996,4.012,3.7852,4.8284,1.8368,3.8124,3.4676,4.4777,5.6176,2.3171,1.4846,1.4636,5.6515,3.5757,8.0346,0.7066,7.723,4.4676,1.7035,7.978,0.2882,1.9313,3.7966,2.4289,0.7106,0.0255,1.7373,2.9286,1.7561,4.9683,4.3732,3.8333,1.0247,8.2365,5.3593,3.4379,1.7804,0.6891,0.5266,3.6465,4.5189,4.5011,4.7828,4.3425,1.1612,7.248,0.4633,2.2017,3.5297,0.2984,1.029,5.416,0.7547,0.5434,3.3956,1.7898,1.4483,5.4924,0.0396,5.2779,6.6619,3.9851,1.6981,2.4416,0.1458,4.5177,6.5413,1.2604,2.7203,0.7328,9.4576,4.8457,0.5295,0.3815,0.5333,3.2314,2.021,0.3207,1.6923,0.5902,2.8546,1.5127,3.8499,2.3271,1.726,4.2291,5.7738,4.1225,5.3502,1.797,0.5797,1.447,6.0491,1.3646,0.139,4.7353,2.3757,0.4975,1.8432,3.4608,0.2634,1.6792,1.7774,6.2092,4.9462,1.0656,3.3572,4.7316,1.719,2.7928,0.9145,0.6015,6.1263,0.6239,7.5121,4.7897,0.9705,1.0232,0.9502,4.8746,1.4765,4.0304,6.245,5.4609,1.4935,4.0016,0.1057,4.6777,8.0126,2.6443,5.9036,1.6583,2.3574,3.7675,1.1511,5.2626,0.6966,3.4524,4.2568,2.3949,1.0619,5.5544,0.1933,2.62,2.2336,1.1766,3.9084,2.8329,0.1566,3.2107,0.4206,0.2029,1.2434,1.3664,1.2074,2.4731,6.965,2.8999,1.122,4.9522,0.8829,0.2942,1.6658,1.5886,4.7821,0.7637,2.3065,2.0005,0.2446,2.9927,0.3311,0.2042,0.6354,7.3796,7.6543,2.6822,0.5994,6.5172,0.0184,0.1193,0.7669,1.3613,1.5552,8.7845,4.1758,1.5415,0.6914,2.0182,0.0005,3.0813,2.6771,1.0534,4.5996,2.4354,0.8383,0.4905,4.4964,0.2984,1.8899,0.5993,6.585,0.3708,6.5034,5.9248,1.8285,0.7302,1.4043,1.5339,2.723,3.4219,2.5512,5.7322,0.4156,5.1328,6.3822,5.0539,2.0964,1.1875,4.6236,1.3575,4.5803,6.3959,0.3301,0.0005,0.6379,1.6261,1.7893,0.173,2.2826,0.7208,2.0735,4.3604,2.7784,0.6373,6.0048,0.4874,4.3686,1.7934,1.173,7.2232,5.6159,3.2152,1.7264,5.1433,1.6765,5.3754,4.5349,1.5083,5.103,1.3596,5.4462,0.9064,5.3557,3.0522,1.0863,1.0746,1.6586,4.3649,2.1024,0.6624,1.3325,0.3484,0.2871,0.2609,4.3789,5.3923,2.8391,1.3867,0.6806,3.194,5.0872,2.6849,0.4689,0.2182,5.1382,6.1182,0.2226,0.9721,3.5014,1.4741,2.0221,0.0046,0.6714,5.9839,5.7976,6.7951,0.0068,2.9473,5.0972,5.0278,0.2151,1.8658,3.992,4.6833,2.0962,2.7571,0.2905,3.1571,3.0557,3.0303,4.5757,7.0656,0.1943,8.048,6.5915,0.5167,1.5992,2.8284,1.1419,2.8259,3.3993,2.3349,3.7564,2.5343,3.4296,0.1611,0.895,6.4202,1.0009,0.1659,3.8057,2.3789,2.9288,0.4143,1.9726,2.0197,1.7817,6.4677,4.0809,2.8936,3.6555,0.6592,2.2373,5.711,1.9608,0.9463,2.5195,2.0002,2.5199,2.1337,1.9557,3.3063,1.8861,0.4318,0.7875,3.0094,0.0108,0.0026,2.0799,2.0887,1.3228,2.0902,0.1301,2.7204,2.8191,0.3515,5.6871,2.3105,9.1566,0.6126,4.5758,2.296,4.8638,1.5057,0.1687,0.0824,5.7125,1.0642,4.8817,1.9541,2.0328,0.0474,5.0682,1.5963,3.1167,0.7866,1.025,6.2051,8.8446,3.237,2.7997,3.1161,0.8117,0.0652,4.0424,7.4794,0.0027,5.9212,3.0622,1.3386,2.2511,5.9893,2.9454,0.0005,1.0418,3.1669,2.5721,1.0135,7.6078,4.9615,3.2382,1.298,3.8796,3.9293,4.3718,0.0004,0.9393,0.1257,0.1074,2.4827,1.4469,0.0004,1.2558,2.8842,2.8135,1.5745,0.6063,3.2288,6.2015,6.034,2.2754,4.6709,4.9523,2.0513,0.2565,0.8061,5.9607,5.0841,4.1435,0.5967,0.4481,2.5151,5.3973,1.3556,2.8604,1.4533,1.9701,0.2095,8.2328,1.4862,1.165,4.1821,2.5497,1.5329,1.0424,7.2014,1.1757,2.6951,5.3467,5.5979,1.9295,5.652,1.3063,1.7162,5.3215,5.5589,3.519,1.872,0.8188,3.5048,1.058,2.1513,1.7043,1.1439,1.149,1.9759,0.0027,4.246,4.4142,5.8674,4.1468,1.3097,4.2402,4.3844,0.6219,5.0125,3.5879,5.5661,3.3362,2.2707,7.0325,0.6983,1.935,5.3427,2.6787,4.5137,2.1051,4.5601,3.418,0.9769,2.2817,6.0248,6.1637,1.7709,3.525,6.8319,2.6847,2.3706,3.0095,3.7914,3.3832,0.0235,0.9459,2.3322,2.6077,4.0887,0.0006,1.5278,2.0768,2.3546,0.2517,1.4091,1.7186,0.6219,3.2104,3.0341,4.6782,2.6199,3.2885,2.729,3.6989,1.5631,2.375,2.554,0.5956,5.124,6.1866,1.6183,1.1453,3.735,1.8389,4.9588,0.4906,3.0009,3.4799,1.8335,2.7786,2.3431,2.0879,0.1295,0.2057,0.987,1.8794,3.3467,0.9927,5.1219,1.3171,4.4608,1.8714,6.2925,4.3817,1.0218,4.9126,3.7804,2.7515,5.1767,0.7608,0.8982,5.1959,6.354,2.0809,3.5108,1.1137,4.6203,2.8222,3.1234,1.5532,1.6083,2.0393,2.8908,2.1936,5.1781,1.063,1.79

{"prompt":"Turkey has released German journalist Mesale Tolu after nearly eight months in prison on the condition that she does not leave the country , German government officials said on Monday . Ankara has charged Tolu","text":"Turkey has released German journalist Mesale Tolu after nearly eight months in prison on the condition that she does not leave the country, German government officials said on Monday. Ankara has charged Tolu with aiding terrorism and espionage in Germany, where she works for a German broadcaster and has been living. Tolu pleaded guilty to defrauding authorities in Germany, which has long treated her cautiously. The German government is reviewing whether it should order her deportation to Turkey. The state of Baden-Wurttemberg, in western Germany, had said earlier on November 24 that it had decided not to extradite Tolu, citing concerns over her safety and the risk she would be tortured and killed. \"Now our country must ask itself: What is the point of the laws that exist and of our courts,\" Baden-Wurttemberg state Secretary of Justice, Ute Lemper, said in an email to reporters. \"Let's decide if we need the laws, the courts, and the prison that we've put her in.\" Lemper said that Baden-Wurttemberg's courts had taken legal steps against Tolu following her convictions last year. She had been convicted of receiving fraudulent visas for her and her family from Turkey, which she said were falsely approved by her employer. Tolu, however, denied receiving fraudulent visas and said her employer denied them to her due to the strict visa policy. She said she was working for a German broadcasting group and had received an \"illegal\" work permit. She said she was a regular visitor to Turkey and had met with Turkish officials.\nMitchell County, GA (KFBD) News - Mitchell County is taking steps to improve and control the disease that has wiped out thousands of hogs during the past several months. Mitchell County Commissioner Jim Smith said that officials are hoping to find some way to use the disease to control pestilence and other diseases. \"It is an effort to control the diseases that have been a problem in the area for a long time,\" he said. It is a natural condition and no antibiotic has been detected in the disease, Commissioner Smith said. \"I don't think a hog has ever died from the disease for any period of time,\" he said. The Mitchell County Commission is planning to buy a herd and train up a local veterinarian so they would be able to control the disease under a veterinarian's supervision. \"They're trying to get the hogs that have developed the disease cured so they can come back to normal population,\" he said. \"The government says there is no cure but they will get them fixed up so they can breed them back into normal populations,\" he said. \"There are plans that have been made but nothing's really been finalized on that yet,\" he said.\nMitchell County Commissioner Jim Smith says he's been asked to resign two times by a member of the county commission due to a possible conflict of interest.\n\"There have been some issues that have come up, some allegations of impropriety,\" he said. \"The county commission has gone to great lengths to make sure no impropriety has occurred. If there was, I'd have to turn it in to the law and let it go that would be the end of it,\" he said. \"It's personal to me, it's personal to the board and I've felt like I have to step in and resolve it and that's been my mind set throughout it. I feel like I am doing that,\" he said. Smith says he has not received anything official or nothing that would warrant him to resign. \"Before any decision was made, there was no allegations done to me and nothing in writing, either from the member of commission or any other member.

{"prompt":"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation \u2019 s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand ,","text":"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation \u2019 s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, reports USA Today.\nAccording to a USA Today story, the biofuels policy committee\u2019s plans to raise the proportion of ethanol that comes from corn by increasing the supply of the feedstock in the next few years and to lower greenhouse gas emissions from new motor fuels from vehicles manufactured or imported from late 2009 on have been dropped.\nThe agency had planned to announce a series of changes to the nation\u2019s biofuels policy, including raising the proportion of ethanol that comes from corn and using a higher proportion of corn-meal-based ethanol in gasoline in 2013, but a series of lawsuits against the new regulations prompted the EPA to stop considering them, USA Today reports.\nAccording to USA Today, the proposed changes were criticized by environmental groups that claimed the proposal would cut the demand for corn-based ethanol. The EPA is also expected to take a final decision over the changes later this fall.\nA coalition of states, led by Ohio, says it has taken up the issue, and will not support the EPA proposal to reduce the amount of new cars and trucks that can use corn-based ethanol that will flow into the U.S. for the time being.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep pursuing this issue to keep driving down the prices of gasoline and biofuels that we depend on, so it will be fair,\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich said at a public hearing about the new regulations.\nUnder the proposed policies, the proportion of biofuels in motor fuels could increase to up to 12 percent, or 10 percent if the vehicles are imported. The new car standards for vehicle emissions would also bring in new rules that would require vehicles to switch to biofuels with lower levels of carbon dioxide, a key contributor to climate change.\nThe U.S. ethanol industry had taken it upon itself to push the EPA to take action to boost production of biofuels to increase ethanol\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. The industry has said that it sees increased demand for ethanol, and that to meet that demand, it needs increased production. But, many environmental groups and politicians had pointed out that increasing use of corn-fed ethanol may cut demand for corn, and as a result, increase the price of ethanol.\nThe EPA and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are working to develop energy-storing chemicals that can be used in the refining process to turn crude oil into gasoline or diesel. The chemicals will be used to decarbify products that have been turned into gasoline and diesel or are coming from refinery off-gases.\nBut the chemicals to do this can\u2019t be manufactured from corn, which is why President Barack Obama plans to use the fuel economy standards, proposed regulations, and EPA efforts to increase the share of ethanol and biodiesel in the U.S.\u2019s gasoline supply to increase the portion of the supply that is from renewable fuels.\nIt will also use policies proposed to cut carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline and to require auto manufacturers to use less fuel-efficient vehicles during the next several years. EPA officials say their plans are subject to legal challenges, that have prompted the agency to postpone the proposal announcements.\nThe proposed rules, which have been criticized by a coalition of state and industry advocates as not sufficient to address ethanol supply pressures, also would make it more difficult to make imported natural gas that is to be used to produce fuels more environmentally-friendly. The agency was hoping that the proposed policy would encourage less greenhouse gases to be emitted from gas plants that make fuels such as natural gas and diesel. The EPA will not announce a final decision on the rules until after the court case has concluded.","token_len":788,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.5641,0.0002,0.0013,1.8754,7.624,2.8928,2.2692,6.6048,0.0044,3.2654,2.9741,0.3102,0.9341,4.2697,18.9695,8.0769,8.3136,7.3916,0.3916,0.0003,4.6309,4.3254,1.853,5.2671,3.6767,1.0051,9.0387,2.208,6.5636,3.1007,7.3753,2.5818,6.6524,0.8029,4.9007,5.8998,5.639,2.7846,7.0854,5.455,0.0665,0.2455,1.0123,17.7202,0.0057,1.8455,6.2694,0.0658,2.987,0.7924,0.9742,6.3536,0.5249,0.0014,3.422,6.5914,9.8436,2.2294,0.426,5.4726,1.4314,6.0305,0.7779,7.6948,0.036,0.7053,2.9181,2.8621,0.1043,0.9305,2.746,8.2421,0.5365,4.9181,0.381,3.3307,4.7205,1.5463,3.9882,1.1749,5.1807,3.3174,0.081,3.1759,4.4435,4.3694,6.0478,0.1248,0.0939,1.7801,4.8132,7.2494,3.9723,4.3987,5.5606,6.972,4.9434,2.0706,1.5244,9.8374,3.8443,6.176,11.5297,0.9582,5.4607,1.2625,0.5514,1.4661,4.9773,4.643,3.839,0.0928,5.0536,2.3314,5.5143,0.0016,1.2442,1.2505,0.6103,4.0589,4.3059,0.0853,2.5412,0.3747,0.2054,0.0003,0.1406,3.6715,1.7206,4.444,0.2652,1.3111,0.0194,0.2726,0.928,0.1308,0.0026,0.016,2.5474,4.5006,2.123,4.6023,1.8493,0.1513,2.5182,2.2573,8.5602,4.0721,0.4472,0.8335,2.5533,3.6388,4.1797,2.7236,1.5482,1.0486,3.807,3.9738,0.005,6.0685,3.7493,0.4332,5.639,4.0614,4.6212,0.4419,1.7674,0.0942,3.854,6.0353,1.8758,2.626,3.1172,0.035,0.9753,0.0725,0.2157,3.7535,0.0038,2.2733,0.0252,0.1795,0.5184,3.3378,0.3474,3.1559,5.726,0.3255,4.0936,0.2529,3.658,4.4242,0.8165,4.0989,0.7654,4.63,2.3342,4.994,0.5561,1.8878,2.4472,0.2911,0.2546,2.1659,2.2652,2.6316,3.4473,2.138,2.0855,0.0028,4.0072,1.849,4.3369,0.8,4.6964,0.5829,3.2901,3.4999,0.0605,4.0423,0.5412,0.2755,3.6777,4.6601,0.1144,3.4536,1.8026,2.0529,0.0083,4.9532,0.5013,6.4497,1.4697,2.3539,4.1217,3.8169,0.402,1.4731,4.1303,1.6093,4.6036,4.965,4.1116,1.0079,4.6952,4.1391,2.0685,3.0126,0.8272,1.4783,0.0267,6.6973,5.9216,2.0145,0.3087,1.6574,2.0917,2.9399,2.1217,1.2825,0.2758,0.0586,5.2437,3.1676,5.4467,0.9689,0.5651,1.3691,0.0005,0.0007,0.1501,4.1795,2.0252,7.0994,0.0039,0.2875,0.4716,5.8832,5.2121,8.6203,7.0181,5.4634,4.7469,3.8586,8.5915,1.6876,1.4831,3.4567,3.9221,4.8453,3.517,0.5229,3.7249,0.5259,2.9786,0.9921,6.0938,0.2044,0.0005,4.7808,1.9259,5.3749,0.1922,2.5064,3.2036,2.9739,2.9593,1.461,5.0359,3.0023,10.7475,6.3995,7.7658,2.1237,0.0274,0.0111,0.0018,1.2464,2.47,0.3929,5.3816,1.9109,4.7596,0.281,3.5215,2.366,1.0014,0.4842,6.1678,0.3311,1.7486,4.2373,0.1107,1.6725,7.5988,0.0309,3.0836,0.2269,0.0003,3.2294,6.1987,1.4366,3.4144,2.1769,2.0859,5.2079,0.0045,4.8385,0.3606,1.7255,3.587,3.9264,1.4312,4.7871,1.2809,6.7437,1.2383,4.6752,2.7629,1.5967,3.8186,5.6718,4.6712,4.0342,5.8217,2.1908,1.9869,1.3101,6.0275,2.3446,4.7196,4.2088,1.8943,0.6242,1.7579,3.4334,0.5707,6.2863,0.7136,3.1289,0.3439,0.0004,4.0379,3.63,2.1077,0.0159,2.3554,0.466,1.6575,2.2946,2.7835,3.8223,0.0778,1.0783,0.0183,0.3961,0.3266,1.4849,3.6234,0.0009,0.0094,0.006,3.2821,0.7399,4.7785,5.3646,5.1922,0.198,0.1194,0.0405,2.3702,1.866,3.5312,0.6113,2.918,1.5444,1.9208,5.5593,3.0091,0.5365,1.5571,0.1568,0.0002,3.9578,5.5435,3.5679,12.9149,1.0948,0.5069,3.2593,0.1779,0.6815,2.502,0.7313,0.171,0.1179,3.1121,1.1907,0.7273,2.0823,2.0701,1.7682,3.341,1.5416,2.0007,6.3784,4.2113,1.1019,0.4616,1.3915,3.4505,1.3678,1.4834,6.5237,1.7483,1.0937,0.1985,0.693,0.9747,1.8194,6.2832,1.6691,2.0481,4.0291,3.6573,5.2818,4.4402,0.1511,2.1817,4.0992,5.0762,4.4915,0.658,0.2844,4.2365,5.8173,0.0196,2.6802,0.4605,5.5108,0.2518,4.615,4.9881,3.7357,0.5663,2.7823,2.4168,1.147,5.6632,0.4536,0.0771,0.4504,4.6253,1.0074,2.9411,0.0995,1.6635,1.0505,0.3411,1.7646,3.067,3.5453,0.9982,2.9478,1.675,0.0029,0.1997,0.0149,2.7434,2.1878,1.224,2.7441,7.3628,2.3846,8.6391,1.5333,6.6628,1.0797,1.6607,1.6981,0.5334,1.8269,2.3072,3.4943,0.9075,1.0317,5.094,5.9803,1.0271,0.5893,3.7665,3.6794,1.0412,0.8822,1.8005,4.0159,2.4802,0.6474,2.0487,0.8117,7.4226,6.4251,1.8391,7.1104,1.638,2.6649,0.7771,4.0032,0.1164,2.413,2.0218,0.2119,5.0619,3.4375,6.524,0.6781,6.2108,7.4277,0.4502,5.8249,3.2005,1.1411,0.6869,3.6269,1.7006,5.472,6.6851,4.2578,1.5809,4.1386,12.5312,1.1603,1.508,0.4228,3.7664,3.2049,1.0566,1.7159,2.4224,1.0292,4.8631,6.4597,1.7247,0.0023,5.8692,0.0253,3.0107,1.5135,4.7849,9.4545,3.2588,3.9131,5.2186,5.8569,0.8112,0.1018,5.7249,5.3677,0.1212,3.0849,1.6406,3.6851,0.024,1.2558,4.5731,3.5265,0.0003,0.932,0.9741,1.4261,0.0006,0.0009,0.0508,6.4545,0.1308,0.69,0.8456,0.2308,2.554,3.9962,1.373,6.5844,0.1613,1.0823,3.5957,0.9194,1.5604,2.8892,6.8753,2.5017,0.6285,0.405,4.3741,3.2639,1.756,6.1874,8.8225,4.4693,4.3961,3.3813,2.6214,1.0929,0.2192,0.7181,2.77,1.2607,4.0444,5.2347,6.015,0.6778,0.1156,2.4852,1.6882,3.217,2.3326,0.3051,1.3734,6.6466,0.8679,2.046,2.7871,0.0726,0.7226,6.7498,1.7232,2.268,4.2767,2.5322,1.4678,6.2039,0.0043,5.1558,0.7587,1.5061,7.3209,5.3525,5.0738,1.6372,1.0123,0.0504,4.986,1.5793,3.2384,12.0924,1.0486,0.5126,1.6781,2.9479,2.461,2.9453,1.0501,2.7782,0.8399,2.9799,0.2096,3.6818,2.3874,0.0375,3.5946,0.725,5.5532,5.7499,4.0563,4.8216,5.395,0.636,2.455,5.2674,4.4147,5.5063,0.3173,2.6786,1.9799,3.5707,0.5188,2.1291,0.

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump plans to nominate Melissa Burnison , a nuclear energy industry lobbyist , to serve as assistant secretary in charge of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the U.S. Energy Department , the White","text":"President Donald Trump plans to nominate Melissa Burnison, a nuclear energy industry lobbyist, to serve as assistant secretary in charge of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the U.S. Energy Department, the White House announced Friday.\nDuring her six years heading up the Energy Department\u2019s Office of International Environment Affairs, Burnison helped develop the U.S.\nenergy policy framework that has been instrumental, among other things, in blocking North Korea from gaining access to the international fuel.\nShe has also been involved with the International Carbon Sequestration Leadership Initiative, which helps to advance carbon sequestration technologies.\nLast Tuesday, New York Times and Washington Post editors Jeff Jarvis and Jake Tapper weighed into a debate over whether and how to cover the U.S. presidential campaign.\nThey wrote that they would keep an open mind and will examine all sides of the story without bias because, as one of Tapper\u2019s opening remarks suggested, \u201cthey can\u2019t all be right.\u201d\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that a CNN reporter had been fired because of an apparent violation of the network\u2019s policy on reporting on terrorism.\nIn the past week, the New York Times and CNN have both reported on alleged violations of their newsroom policies, and both have apologized. On Friday, New York Times and WNYC reporter Sam Brodeur resigned and Tapper defended his decision to fire his reporter.\nThe New York Sun newspaper reported on Aug. 25 that Trump was considering appointing Scott Pruitt as U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief.\nPruitt, who is currently the head of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is in a leadership position that he\u2019s had for the past 17 years and would be the first openly gay person to serve as head of EPA.\nThe Trump campaign has said that he would not have the agency\u2019s final decision-making authority, but he would be able to advise the president on environmental matters. The Wall Street Journal reported that the president is considering his choice.\nThis is not a surprise, but some are still unprepared for it. As news of the Trump administration\u2019s appointment of Brett McGurk to the Central Intelligence Agency came out last week, some people thought that was a joke.\nBut the post-Washington Post Washington Examiner poll released last Thursday suggests that a much higher percentage of Americans are surprised by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to fire James Clapper.\nThe poll, which was conducted by Rasmussen and commissioned by the Associated Press, found that 54 percent of respondents are surprised by the decision to fire Clapper, while a somewhat smaller percentage, 37 percent, said they expected it.\nThe only person I ever believed in, even before I knew him, was myself. And so I did the opposite of what was expected and that was the best job.\nAt first there seemed to be a fair amount of concern among the media that a potential Trump administration would try to ban Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube from operating on the U.\nThe Washington Post reports that as of Thursday evening, neither Google nor anyone else seemed to have indicated that they expect a change in the rules. Still others are concerned that the president\u2019s picks do not go far enough in trying to curb online threats to democracy.\nBut one person in the Trump administration who said he was close to the president believes that the appointment of Brett McGurk as CIA director is far more concerning than any of the other suggestions.\nOn the one-year anniversary of the release of his memoir, former CIA

{"prompt":"Canada will expel a Venezuelan diplomat and also bar the country s ambassador from returning , Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday , two days after Venezuela booted out Canada s envoy for criticizing","text":"Canada will expel a Venezuelan diplomat and also bar the country s ambassador from returning, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday, two days after Venezuela booted out Canada s envoy for criticizing human rights. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Sunday he was quitting Canada, where he had worked since 2002, and expelling his ambassador. Freeland said Trump administration officials were speaking with Maduro on Monday. Canadians have been flying to Venezuela in droves to protest the government, buying food, and sending relief to millions affected by a deepening economic crisis in the oil-producing state. Trump has suggested U.S. citizens might travel to Venezuela in safety but said on Saturday that he didn t yet know whether that would be possible. Mr. Arreaza said in Sunday evening telephone conference with reporters he told Ms. Freeland that the ambassador s return to Canada was not possible as long as his country was in conflict with neighbouring countries or the United States. Mr. Morneau made the comments to reporters outside the Government House in Ottawa before the release of a report by a working group that examined the case of a Canadian detained on suspicion of terrorism before being released. He offered no comment on the Venezuelan decision to bar Mr. Arreaza s ambassador from returning. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, his handpicked successor, and government leaders should leave office. Canada on its website warned that it would not recognize Nicolas Maduro s presidency, or the result of Sunday s election. The report found that Mr. Arreaza s refusal to respond to a subpoena was inconsistent with the usual diplomatic conduct. Mr. Morneau said the report also found some facts that suggested Mr. Arreaza was not acting in accordance with his post by not attending ministerial sessions and other meetings. Mr. Arreaza didn t say whether Canada would continue to recognize Maduro, who has been in power since 2013. He said Venezuela was facing a coup. Mr. Maduro is seeking to challenge the January result in a Supreme Court campaign that promises to be bitter and bloody. He called Sunday s election a failed coup. Maduro, a heavy drinker and former baseball player, is fighting authoritarianism in Venezuela that has gone from one crisis to another. The country is struggling with high inflation, which this year is projected to peak at nearly 1,000,000,000 billion percent, and shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. Many Venezuelans say the problems are brought on by a U.S.-backed opposition that is seeking to topple Maduro to replace him with a more centrist candidate. The government has accused the opposition of orchestrating a terrorist attack in which four people were killed last month. Venezuelan lawmakers were briefly ousted by pro-government protesters in February. Mr. Maduro has made clear that Venezuela isn t open to an end to human rights violations and free elections. Ms. Freeland said that the Trump administration and Canada were working with other countries to support the return of democracy and the rights of Venezuelans. She said the relationship between Canada and Venezuela has a long history of mutual support. That will help the people of Venezuela, she said, as did the relationship between Canada and the United States. Mr. Arreaza left for Buenos Aires last week to meet with Maduro, and Venezuela accused Canada of not being neutral in that country s crisis and calling for an end to the Maduro administration. The U.S. embassy also accused Ottawa of failing to intervene in Venezuela s election in the first place. Venezuela booted Mr. Arreaza from his post in late May 2017 when he refused to meet a government subpoena. Mr. Morneau said Sunday that the Canadians who had been detained by Venezuelan authorities were not terrorists and denied that had Canada helped to hand them over.

William Wehrum, who had worked for the EPA under two Republican administrations and was nominated to be an assistant chief for air quality monitoring, is the first official in the agency confirmed without support from Democrats. \u201cThese are not his first stints at the agency, these are industry jobs. They have been industry jobs,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown. \u201cThat\u2019s not the record that people need to be reading. People need to be reading his record as an EPA employee.\u201d His nomination comes amid a continuing battle in the Senate over the need for a national air quality standards after years of legal battles over the effectiveness of the current standards. On the House side, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation had opposed several amendments, including one that would have ensured that only the highest standard was applied, because they felt it was not achievable, according to senators and their staff. The chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, told reporters on Wednesday that his group didn\u2019t vote for several amendments because they were \u201cmore conservative\u201d than the text before the committee. Harkin said some of the language aimed to protect the country\u2019s lead-emitting mines, and he added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think we need to have something there as an exception and exemption in a nation-wide approach.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency did not take a position on the House amendments, and a White House official said no decisions had been made among the administration. White House hopefuls have floated a proposal for an \u201cinitiative\u201d that would have the ability to propose a national standards and it would have to achieve wide support in Congress, in addition to having to undergo the congressional process that the current system does. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday by a 7-1 margin on a bill that would require judges and magistrates, not prosecutors, to try certain federal cases. \u201cIt is our intention that all federal civil rights cases be tried by a judge or magistrate who is a member of the judicial branch of the federal government instead of a member of the executive branch,\u201d the bill states. It follows the enactment last year of the federal rule that requires judges and prosecutors to try all federal civil rights cases in their jurisdiction. The legislation would be effective Jan. 1, 2016. It was co-authored by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). Udall says the bill would benefit both the United States of America and American Indian tribes and Native American tribes. It was the subject of a recent hearing before the Committee on Oversight and Reform. \u201cThis bill will give our tribe an opportunity that we\u2019ve never had in almost 50 years for their tribal courts to hold a free and fair trial with equality with their fellow citizen,\u201d Udall said of the bill. The legislation follows the enactment last year of the federal rule that requires justice department judges and prosecutors to try all federal civil rights cases in their jurisdiction and would prevent judges and prosecutors from trying cases for other branches of the government in the Indian nation territory. Udall said he supported the rule, noting that the rule required the justices to have an understanding of the Indian culture and community. \u201cAn amendment was passed before the other side can say that this bill goes against our right, that isn\u2019t at all. It\u2019s simply empowerment of tribes, empowerment of our judicial system to uphold their rights,\u201d he said. The bill follows the enactment of the federal rule that requires federal courts across the country to try all federal criminal cases, including those crimes involving discrimination.","token_len":790,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,3.7896,2.3491,2.1245,9.31,0.2477,2.7732,0.3249,2.1087,3.5858,4.1391,10.1321,4.0342,1.3472,3.3644,0.4401,1.1053,0.0004,0.0008,1.5435,5.2959,3.079,3.7226,0.2839,3.9852,1.8597,3.1147,9.7698,0.7459,0.9129,10.5829,7.684,3.0309,6.7865,0.426,1.8869,3.7276,3.5437,1.1012,0.843,0.8935,2.8799,6.3995,2.8434,0.4279,2.3921,1.9247,3.2757,0.9759,2.8569,4.0006,2.0108,4.7699,3.2285,2.1719,0.2015,6.0963,0.767,2.7576,2.2319,2.6179,2.7326,3.0524,0.6678,1.4207,7.9916,6.0468,6.173,0.3125,1.8606,0.2748,14.1458,6.942,9.3219,1.6415,2.7004,6.5209,2.8336,4.0906,2.4948,1.1452,0.6658,0.885,1.5622,9.1342,0.1072,9.2728,3.8049,1.5542,4.1535,3.062,0.9888,7.7145,0.2406,2.7918,11.201,6.9061,4.1362,2.0417,0.0024,4.9306,0.0068,0.0008,4.1423,2.5069,0.6223,4.8222,9.9212,8.5992,4.1366,2.1792,2.2639,6.3815,1.8676,5.5872,3.6682,0.4214,2.659,7.0753,2.0583,5.2841,0.5225,0.0977,0.9696,2.8462,4.9944,0.8358,4.2355,1.5501,1.3269,3.8322,1.235,1.9289,2.6089,6.0643,3.8524,4.2545,3.1517,1.4941,4.3407,3.2591,3.2452,1.6229,0.6269,0.2522,1.8228,5.2277,0.6289,1.3869,5.6513,2.7555,0.1093,3.7796,10.0955,3.7565,0.0158,6.657,1.1391,1.2266,1.7219,7.6396,0.0477,1.4988,6.5395,1.7872,0.3709,5.0992,3.1926,3.5313,0.3275,0.1409,2.4671,3.1564,0.0316,0.0646,3.5904,1.0303,2.9043,0.0022,2.686,4.7166,3.3358,5.4879,3.6301,3.8569,0.6748,1.8002,0.7008,0.6359,0.1878,6.7726,0.7734,4.247,2.6298,4.2182,7.9241,2.0248,2.4738,2.749,5.2272,3.5187,4.2235,1.631,1.0252,2.6243,6.1646,3.487,3.1039,0.0011,4.9528,2.9728,3.9452,1.5569,0.7316,1.7334,7.3752,0.1174,0.0808,0.7231,3.4714,0.0041,0.1221,0.2716,1.384,0.0006,3.7018,3.1841,0.0029,2.0945,0.0026,0.0362,3.4913,0.855,2.2919,1.6201,0.2913,2.9409,3.957,5.3781,5.9279,4.7249,0.0466,4.4018,1.2785,7.3043,1.1081,2.9521,1.2017,1.3167,10.7994,1.328,6.2028,3.6398,3.0625,2.6663,1.2959,0.9238,7.9668,8.0671,1.4714,3.0979,1.0524,3.5982,0.0077,1.1462,5.339,0.7708,0.5011,4.4312,7.4022,1.6842,2.8068,1.7544,5.6599,3.9272,0.842,0.6975,7.5681,3.5459,7.8405,0.6994,6.4802,1.6438,2.4917,2.8737,2.609,3.5564,2.0744,1.0635,2.2561,2.1237,0.3131,1.0822,0.004,2.6955,2.2304,2.6866,0.5995,3.6351,6.6391,6.3733,4.4924,2.3685,6.5314,4.6736,7.5411,3.7303,3.8282,5.6907,5.3188,0.4247,5.9964,1.0767,1.5362,1.448,2.055,4.4984,0.0014,0.0188,3.8728,0.4139,5.5759,1.541,0.3852,0.1413,0.7697,4.8173,2.179,0.9654,2.2222,3.5049,4.2172,0.0007,0.9713,0.9298,4.3283,4.4445,1.012,0.1481,0.093,8.722,0.8851,4.2953,1.6732,4.7822,0.0041,9.5901,0.002,0.0,1.6525,6.4294,2.3999,4.0058,2.1455,2.9086,15.3239,0.4096,4.829,1.6533,0.1744,2.6272,1.7233,2.1071,0.1069,1.8768,5.3984,5.1012,0.0155,5.4467,2.2536,2.1044,2.4072,4.1005,7.2858,0.8114,2.699,0.5731,7.3479,6.2136,1.5734,1.5939,1.5813,1.8941,4.8668,1.5861,0.0042,4.1985,0.7507,6.2568,3.1936,5.2476,1.63,3.7479,3.5403,5.0357,3.0567,2.0618,1.9845,1.7362,3.3503,5.5659,0.0378,3.3559,2.1648,2.3569,6.6859,0.7311,4.0188,0.1404,2.4709,1.2636,2.9596,0.9496,1.8425,0.6786,0.128,2.1707,8.347,2.7985,7.179,0.0031,4.1867,2.9009,5.0623,0.2815,0.0343,7.5154,4.6667,5.0402,3.8666,1.6587,4.6592,0.2363,3.3191,1.6071,4.0531,3.9415,1.9065,3.3961,1.8952,3.7351,1.6739,1.2925,1.1932,3.6727,1.7979,1.8431,3.1616,2.6655,1.5866,3.4086,1.3163,2.687,2.6479,0.0094,0.2157,4.6375,1.3524,1.2256,0.5352,1.2894,0.0282,7.2208,0.0126,1.1306,3.4748,0.0163,0.527,1.9238,0.0426,2.2068,0.7068,1.1092,2.4203,3.2888,3.198,0.0892,2.741,5.6798,2.1546,4.4787,4.6513,0.6497,0.0506,0.8191,4.8782,5.6212,3.0266,2.8334,2.6045,1.0195,3.6483,0.2008,3.3241,2.904,0.7533,1.5048,0.1105,0.1541,2.6927,2.9941,2.1912,0.5775,1.4151,3.4684,1.6399,4.0584,3.4858,4.0509,0.0025,0.0714,0.5604,2.125,0.416,3.0891,2.595,4.4182,0.0342,3.7903,0.0279,1.0783,0.0023,3.1055,2.4483,1.8058,0.0902,0.0664,0.0807,0.0001,1.1442,0.0942,0.9914,0.0018,3.5484,2.1614,0.0009,0.0862,0.0224,0.0051,0.6503,0.0012,0.0274,0.4947,6.2583,0.0002,5.738,1.0739,1.3863,1.2118,5.6793,3.7564,1.0551,3.5396,0.0008,3.6685,0.0021,0.0757,4.5732,5.7935,1.0725,1.971,4.1053,1.0703,1.1268,0.9765,3.2645,2.8698,3.6609,4.8633,0.0058,0.719,4.0154,3.0527,2.6262,0.0989,4.7586,0.1131,2.886,0.0229,8.3499,1.0014,3.5095,0.2163,3.8878,1.6918,2.6277,3.8497,3.4757,5.5555,4.0546,0.8586,5.9608,2.6809,7.3466,0.9793,1.3864,0.7743,0.4965,2.6697,5.907,2.2372,0.0087,5.797,5.0976,3.7982,3.8407,0.4805,5.4291,2.6422,8.1848,1.5648,0.0825,0.3633,5.2049,9.0839,7.1129,3.0112,3.8078,6.2026,3.2517,0.4195,1.0845,2.1436,0.0002,0.402,6.1132,0.1382,0.5793,0.1568,1.9494,3.4716,5.9184,1.7102,1.2269,2.7905,0.0665,0.0113,0.2729,0.3052,0.0488,0.085,0.1175,9.2848,7.9447,2.1848,0.7691,1.1294,0.0744,0.4992,1.3506,0.0455,0.0447,0.0031,0.0223,0.0439,0.005,0.0803,4.4873,2.8415,5.5598,3.0851,0.2972,0.111,0.0498,2.1571,3.2344,4.3666,4.4853,6.2904,0.1624,1.181,1.2335,3.7435,1.9472,6.1069,4.3248,7.4643,0.7345,3.2244,0.0003,1.1268,1.8222,3.0556,0.4048,5.9851,1.6897,3.9,0.3945,1.7418,3.2741,4.7444,2.1754,5.9181,0.3174,3.1656,3.0891,4.1824,0.406,0.6819,3.5839,4.3831,0.7462,5.0064,1.7936,2.6836,0.0814,6.0842,3.36,3.3193,3.7794,5.7416,0.2837,7.3725,3

Today, more than a decade after the embassy reopened, there is an even greater demand for a U.S. presence in Zimbabwe, due in part to the political turmoil that has followed Mugabe\u2019s successful coup in July 2017.\nIn August 2007, the U.S. began a project to help the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe establish a U.S. desk in Harare and a U.S. consular presence in the country. This work, which was accomplished by U.S. State Department Office of Consular Affairs staff, has been instrumental in establishing a U.S. presence in Zimbabwe and is due to continue into the future.\nSince September 2007, the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Jim Beinecke, has been working to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Zimbabwe and to bolster the American presence in the country. To that end, he has hosted frequent bilateral conversations with senior officials, including both the ministers of foreign affairs and agriculture. More recently, Ambassador Beinecke has led a delegation of senior officials to Zambia and Mozambique to seek partnership and economic benefit for Zimbabwe.\nDuring Ambassador Beinecke\u2019s tenure as State Department Counsel, the U.S. Embassy in Harare worked with the media and American leaders and other diplomats to promote U.S. interests in the country. To that end, the embassy has hosted approximately 75 media trips and conducted media training programs for more than 800 journalists over three years. In addition, the embassy's newly installed media communications team is currently working with the Zimbabwean government to provide training assistance to journalists.\nFrom 2009 through 2016, the embassy hosted two large political conventions and provided assistance to a number of political campaigns in the country. In 2013, the embassy also worked with key political stakeholders to produce a report for the U.S. House of Representatives that helped identify and recommend improvements to the electoral process in Zimbabwe. As the U.S. embassy in Harare has focused on supporting the government of Zimbabwe, it has worked with the United States to encourage continued support for the country\u2019s democratic institutions and free and fair elections.\nThe Embassy will continue to focus on the needs of the United States in the country, while working to support democratic reform and continued progress in the democratic process in the country, including a free and fair presidential election.

Reuters has not edited the statements","text":"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @ realDonaldTrump and @ POTUS. The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements. PI:USER #Washpost #HatchAct\nPI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER PI:USER #Washpost #FoxNews\nWith the end of the Trump presidency right around the corner, there\u2019s no way to say what is a sure thing. What we do know is that there are many, many, many people who are terrified of what the future may bring.\nThere is much, much fear and uncertainty about the future. Many have already become so terrified that they have jumped ship. It\u2019s not just people who have been involved with Trump, but also people who have been involved with Joe Biden. People who have been involved with Bernie Sanders. The people who have come out to help Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. I know that many people in the Democrat base who have been active within these campaigns have been terrified.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Democrats who were terrified, however. For those in the corporate media, fear of something coming down on their heads was just as bad.\nMany of the Trump supporters who have come out of the shadows and entered the arena over the last few days are, unfortunately, people who are in the corporate media. People who were actively promoting hate, discrimination, and discrimination in all forms. They weren\u2019t happy to see that Trump was reelected and wanted to take him down. It shouldn\u2019t really surprise us that there are some in the corporate media who would be happy to see Trump down.\nI know that when you are a small minority of the population and you find yourself being targeted by a larger minority, you have an increased tendency toward violence. Not only were the Democrats actively harassing Trump supporters, but they were actively encouraging violence.\nYou can look at the riots that took place at the Capitol building in Washington over the last several days. There were many people in the buildings who were protesting. They were actively pushing for the Democrats to take down Trump. Some on the grounds were protesting in such a violent fashion that they were taking the very people who were protesting violently down with them.\nIn other words, what we saw in Washington on January 6 was not the result of a peaceful protest. It was the result of an organized, pro-Trump protest. That should not be surprising.\nA peaceful protest is a legitimate response. There are hundreds of peaceful protests taking place across the country right now. There are peacefully protesting for Biden. There are peacefully protesting for Sanders. There are peacefully protesting for Harris. I, of course, am in favor of a peaceful protest.\nBut the thing I will say is that I do find it alarming when someone takes a peaceful protest into violence. It\u2019s not that I find Trump supporters outnumbering the Democrats in the peaceful demonstrations, but I do find it alarming when the people who are in charge of leading the demonstrations become people who are actively encouraging violence.\nWhen a peaceful protest goes violent, the people who are responsible for leading the peaceful protest need to be taken out of the public arena. They need to be removed from the public eye. If you take a peaceful protest into violence, there is zero doubt that you need to be removed from public office.\nI am sure that these people who were seen leading these demonstrations and encouraging violence are terrified to leave the situation in control of others.

Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday he expects more Republican colleagues to speak out against Donald Trump \u2019 s behavior and policies , one day after denouncing the Republican president in a fiery","text":"U.S. Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday he expects more Republican colleagues to speak out against Donald Trump \u2019 s behavior and policies, one day after denouncing the Republican president in a fiery Senate floor speech.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has taken a more conciliatory tone toward Trump in recent months, also said he expects more to say their opposition to the president. McConnell, who has said he has been \u201cgrossly deceived,\u201d added, however, that he thinks the president wants to be the commander-in-chief of the American people.\nThe House of Representatives on Wednesday also rejected a draft of a resolution urging Trump to resign that contained a call for impeachment after three witnesses testified under oath to Capitol Hill that they heard incitements to violence from Donald Trump as he encouraged the crowd to march on the Capitol.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, New York, who introduced the resolution, said he was disappointed in the House \u2019 s rejection.\nThe House vote had Democrats\u2019 allies at the White House and Capitol Hill feeling empowered to force Trump to quit.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that a few months ago we didn\u2019t think the president would be impeached,\u201d said Chuck Schumer. \u201cHowever, since the vote to impeach, we\u2019ve heard from multiple witnesses that they saw Donald Trump on January 6th and heard him speak to them.\u201d\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California, said that she had hoped the Senate would pass the impeachment resolution, adding that her party wanted the chamber to move forward.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York, said the resolution was a \u201cpower game.\u201d \u201cIf they don\u2019t pass it, if they don\u2019t send it to the Senate, this is a political attempt. This is what power politics is like.\u201d\nHe said the House should have done it in December after it was released by Democratic officials and that it is now a part of history.\nThe resolution, which is expected to be sent to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is expected to be considered by the Senate on Friday, days before the Senate\u2019s scheduled March 3 recess.\nOn Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee voted 21-0 to support sending the impeachment resolution to the Senate, a full two weeks after hearing key legal arguments about the urgency of the proceedings and the right to impeach.\nDemocratic Senator Brian Schatz, of New Hampsire, said the impeachment resolution was \u201cpart of a process that starts in the House, that follows through to the Senate.\u201d\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he would vote for the resolution, but said some of the language on the floor was too blunt.\nIt was an emotional moment for some in the Senate on Wednesday. One of the impeachment managers to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, took a break and burst into tears.\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, of California, called the vote an \u201chistoric day\u201d and said it was important for the Senate to move quickly after the events at the Capitol in Washington. Feinstein, one of the leaders of the Democrats in the Senate and a vocal opponent of Trump \u2019 s reelection campaign, said the Republican House members should be punished for their actions.\nTrump made no public statements before Thursday \u2019 s Senate vote on the impeachment resolution.

{"prompt":"Turkey s Vakifbank said on Friday it had never had any interest or involvement whatsoever in any of the processes mentioned in the U.S. trial of a Turkish bank executive accused of helping to launder","text":"Turkey s Vakifbank said on Friday it had never had any interest or involvement whatsoever in any of the processes mentioned in the U.S. trial of a Turkish bank executive accused of helping to launder billions of dollars in Iran money.\nIran is a leading supplier of weapons to the Syrian opposition and is using Damascus to transport Iranian oil to the West.\n\"It is also not our bank for years,\" said Mehmet Tekinoglu, acting undersecretary of the ministry of justice and chairman of the supervisory board of the Vakifbank, when asked if Vakifbank had any ties to the bank accused of being a cover for Iranian activity in Turkey.\n\"The U.S. government accused our bank of doing business on behalf of Iran without any legal or official documents and documents that we possess prove that it is a lie,\" Tekinoglu told reporters.\nHe continued, \"We always worked with clients who are legitimate and who are working towards a legal market with Turkey. We only deal with legitimate activities and we have never worked with one that is not. This is our policy.\"\nVakifbank was once one of Turkey's most important banks, with a branch network in most of the world and strong ties to many Muslim countries.\nIts assets surpassed a record 400 billion Turkish Liras ($60 billion) in 2014, though revenues have declined and many of its branches have been closed.\nLast month, the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations alleged a series of connections, particularly between U.S.-based lobbyists, and the Vakifbank.\nIran's Foreign Ministry has rejected the allegations and has described the case as one meant to sabotage the progressing normalization of ties between Tehran and Washington.\nIn an apparent reference to the allegations, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said last Friday that the \"accusations are nothing but nonsense designed to undermine the interests of Iran in the Western countries and try to mislead the public opinion of that countries.\"\nVakifbank's alleged activities have also raised concern in Turkey, where opposition parties are calling for the Vakifbank to be closed down.\nIran and Turkey have both had a difficult relationship for decades, with the country accusing Turkey of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Iraq and the Kurdish independence movement in Turkey.\nTurkey has called Iran an \"occupation force\" in Syria's civil war, saying it has assisted militias loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Iran in bomb attacks against Sunni opposition groups.\nIn 2013, Washington sent a delegation to the United Nations to condemn a military campaign by the Islamic Republic against Sunni rebels, arguing that it was targeting Shi'ites instead. It included Turkish diplomats, suggesting that there were Turkish meddling behind the scenes.\nHowever, the U.S. said they had gone to the United Nations to protect Turkish interests in the crisis.\nThis summer, Washington accused Turkey of intervening in a diplomatic mission to Iran, allowing it to get into the diplomatic zone without being questioned, and said there had been Turkish meddling in the deployment of the UN.\nIn mid-September, Turkey said it was sending troops to northern Syria to help in the fight against the Islamic State. But in a later statement, the military said the base would be closed after its initial two-year mandate had expired.\n\"There are many more points like this,\" said Tekinoglu. \"For example, there were many cases (which would) have been illegal in Europe. People were arrested by the Turkish police.

{"prompt":"U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult , public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law","text":"U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law\u2019s requirements. \u201cCertain guidance on how to respond to and treat certain tax rules are now required by law,\u201d the Financial Regulation Financing Committee said in a statement to be released to CFOs at the end of the week. The Financial Services Oversight Council, the second line of attack, said companies should review whether they will need to file more than one kind of financial reporting under this new tax law. The new law requires companies to report both their tax return and Form 1099-K. Financial reporting under this new tax law also is likely to be more complicated. The government added an additional chapter to the new code, with guidance available in both Internal Revenue Service guidance and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. \u201cIn short, the key is to know the extent to which the tax rules are already in place with respect to your business, and if there\u2019s an additional impact you need to account for,\u201d said Joseph E. Fusco, a finance director at Eckel & Johnson in New York. \u201cAs you review your business arrangements, think of whether the new tax law has an impact. If there is, you\u2019re not obligated to account for it right away, which is the difference between good news and bad news.\u201d The government is taking a page from the corporate playbook. Before the enactment of the new tax law in December, some financial services advisers and investors warned a rush to write off potentially costly costs by delaying reporting for two months was ill-advised. Financial services companies have to adjust their operations from day one to comply with the law and any delays would make it harder to plan for the new regulations, as they would have to work out the differences between how they did things under the old law and what they are required to do under the new tax law. That\u2019s why Fannie Mae Chief Financial Officer Tom Williams said in recent conference calls that tax-related costs increased about $2.9 billion, or 9.6 percent, for the first quarter. Companies could also be forced to report some of their tax-related expenses on their financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board said in its guidance that certain reporting is due \u201cspecifically related to\u201d the new tax law. But CFOs say the guidance has given up any specifics about the reporting timelines and it is unclear whether they should report all of them. \u201cFinancial advisors are beginning to realize that it would be prudent to review the tax impact of their current financial planning and investment activity as soon as possible, particularly if that is not already a part of the due diligence process,\u201d said Robert Oppenheimer, president of PwC. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait until September.\u201d Fannie Mae Chief Financial Officer Tom Williams said in recent conference calls that tax-related costs increased about $2.9 billion, or 9.6 percent. However, companies could be forced to report some of their tax-related expenses on their financial statements. The new law also requires companies to keep a record of certain transactions. Some transactions might be exempt from tax under the amended code, but others might have to be reported when time comes. CFO Jim Sink, who oversees financial reporting at Morgan Stanley\u2019s fixed income and investment management businesses, said he and his employees are meeting with clients to help them prepare for the new law. \u201cThe biggest concern is the tax,\u201d Sink said.

{"prompt":"Dawn hues of pink and purple reveal a dusty valley in Bangladesh s southern hills quilted with a dense settlement of red tents home to more than 230 women and children grieving for lost husbands","text":"Dawn hues of pink and purple reveal a dusty valley in Bangladesh s southern hills quilted with a dense settlement of red tents home to more than 230 women and children grieving for lost husbands and other male family members. The women are busy processing the remains \u2013 removing flesh, ripping open hearts, and throwing up the bodies into a mass grave. In a nearby field, an undead man strolls around, his body covered with blood. This man\u2019s identity is unclear but his face, the site of a large cut under his left eye, suggests that he is a member of a local vigilante group. And there are signs that the attackers were trained by extremists in Afghanistan. A bomb planted at the scene of the attack went off in the night. The blast killed six people, including the vigilantes\u2019 leader.\nWhen Alia (pseudonym), an older woman who has lived with her husband in this valley for 20 years, arrived to the camp two weeks ago with her children, she could not believe the massacre: \u201cThere was such anger among the villagers, I thought we would attack their camp, like the villagers had attacked mine.\u201d The violence has intensified in April, but the reason the woman doesn\u2019t know is that, at each attack, many families find it useful to blame the other. The villagers' fear is so great that if they are caught with the victims\u2019 bodies nearby, they will be punished as well.\nIn the days after the first attack, women in the camp decided to work together to process the dead and dig a deep grave. A few days later, there were a dozen or more. Many women were angry with the villagers for their indifference, but they were also worried that if they started killing themselves, the local police might take steps to quench the conflict, and stop the women from attending the camp.\nWomen are not usually allowed to stay in a cemetery. This had been true in the past, but recently more women have joined the men at the grave digging. Some were afraid the villagers would stop helping them. One of the villagers was arrested, even though he confessed to the killing. As it is not possible to find any local women as witnesses to the crime, it was suspected he had sold the information to the attackers.\nThere was a second attack in the following week. A local youth, who lives in the area, shot five villagers dead and wounded two others, before shooting himself dead. A woman from the village was arrested and charged, but her testimony was not believed. The police charged her with \u201cdisobeying orders\u201d, but did not charge the men.\nThe victim\u2019s relatives say that the police have been reluctant to take action against the attackers themselves; according to the victims' relatives, the two men who were killed while defending themselves were not arrested, but left to die. Alia and her husband didn\u2019t know the men\u2019s names, but they knew that they were from Ghalibnagar, a district along the border with India. It was also told that the men had come to a different area in the nearby town of Jharkhand and that they were in a different group of women. The camp was established only three days before the attack and there is no evidence to say that the men had any involvement with the villagers. Alia\u2019s family says that their relatives would not like to believe that the men were linked to the group they were defending because the men had not threatened her children before the attack \u2013 at least not in front of their mother.\nThe story also raises the possibility of a link between the women in the camp and the attackers, since many of the victims were also from the vicinity. In some cases, the women have refused to be part of the grave site; many of them are angry with the police for not following their instructions that they close the camp.","token_len":797,"entropy":[9.4137,9.3369,5.1901,2.0789,5.3864,1.7005,2.5645,8.0386,1.5723,7.88,6.1921,3.6557,10.5656,9.1103,9.8942,4.7279,12.447,5.287,0.4497,0.3512,3.3848,4.0936,8.5853,0.4186,4.7533,7.5396,10.3395,0.0186,4.4837,0.0255,6.5316,5.5406,0.9196,0.2976,12.1082,1.4003,2.7861,2.2152,0.9214,5.1863,6.1654,5.7174,0.0281,0.4752,2.3433,4.4714,2.2515,7.0622,8.3365,1.657,5.2202,7.1006,9.5097,6.0749,1.0481,6.5018,3.9035,5.0292,0.7235,1.2387,5.0433,3.4494,2.8158,2.0838,3.4784,1.4875,5.0353,0.1703,0.6724,4.3325,2.4296,5.1773,3.9129,0.3868,3.5358,8.5369,2.2826,7.9764,0.0011,3.818,2.1552,3.7909,3.9989,2.1449,1.1592,2.1134,0.9829,5.4961,1.6178,13.3112,7.2746,3.8394,4.8144,0.736,3.9003,2.9171,2.1455,2.6155,3.1037,4.2272,7.4081,0.2372,1.766,5.4143,7.6524,6.4162,0.3636,2.3942,0.5897,0.2637,4.4009,1.2589,0.297,1.256,1.5873,2.6038,0.0025,1.2958,3.8469,5.0134,0.2781,0.7958,5.5989,3.6348,1.6283,2.3922,1.2084,1.8026,7.1287,2.2762,4.9114,1.4476,6.4632,1.7559,3.348,0.9286,3.0584,6.3328,3.1631,2.5851,0.8026,2.8528,1.597,0.4114,0.7588,6.7023,0.0082,2.1568,1.3566,3.8745,1.9269,2.1181,5.077,2.5099,3.7523,0.8137,1.3821,0.6823,1.9135,10.0299,0.0768,3.3121,0.0772,14.3712,1.4601,1.8712,9.7029,6.2929,4.4783,6.4692,6.5771,0.1465,0.0572,2.4741,2.683,4.4521,0.9219,2.49,2.8744,2.7966,3.1771,1.2653,1.2141,1.8707,4.1573,2.1925,0.4664,3.7654,0.0338,0.1443,2.6616,2.5358,2.6857,4.7226,5.3329,1.2642,0.1013,3.6748,0.9782,3.0355,0.3963,0.6976,4.8741,0.4819,1.6695,2.016,5.3385,5.3186,7.7245,5.9207,5.6603,1.0001,4.4661,6.0429,4.0549,0.6821,1.9391,1.9583,3.8464,2.0842,4.529,2.0842,7.1367,4.5521,5.3658,1.9715,5.392,2.5551,5.0716,4.114,2.5618,5.692,2.8608,2.6868,7.5762,2.9243,5.4641,2.9191,3.637,1.9643,7.2569,1.3288,4.6125,1.5924,7.281,4.1968,5.0403,6.0444,2.1835,0.1547,0.9983,2.034,1.5696,0.9522,4.0609,3.5151,7.7514,2.3948,0.2659,4.9077,3.9093,5.6571,3.031,8.1267,0.1385,5.8579,0.9711,4.1787,1.1815,2.3602,2.9025,4.3319,3.7285,1.4677,4.6444,1.9088,0.1721,5.6584,1.2677,2.6391,3.5806,3.1351,1.9228,4.8621,3.4034,0.0219,10.2719,7.6009,0.4137,0.6993,1.8683,1.4551,5.9048,3.7993,2.6853,0.4425,1.5071,2.8433,1.3258,4.0346,1.5822,0.2002,4.6658,0.6508,0.2967,5.2201,2.4341,0.9224,3.013,5.0123,0.291,5.5352,2.3075,0.7998,9.0378,0.5076,3.0019,2.0846,6.8706,2.7926,6.2503,0.685,0.7451,3.6275,2.5722,1.1582,0.7111,0.1598,4.7586,1.146,3.6401,3.4533,2.0803,1.2206,3.7822,4.2542,2.7109,3.0541,6.181,2.6399,0.6086,2.3046,1.4758,2.6368,5.2104,2.0206,1.3473,1.8105,1.8092,1.6147,3.4494,1.0076,2.6994,0.5535,4.2515,3.3245,4.5058,0.4087,1.6577,4.831,2.5471,1.5552,3.3269,5.5052,0.4422,5.5345,6.5709,1.2558,6.5774,3.5348,2.2076,4.8659,0.9016,4.3222,0.4052,7.0602,2.4,4.6112,0.3765,1.8996,5.564,2.9393,2.3989,5.0223,2.9307,0.1884,4.0613,0.6544,3.0194,4.4545,1.7712,3.7709,6.7153,1.1968,6.9633,1.609,1.2145,1.4119,0.8772,1.3259,4.9408,5.4396,1.0924,1.2596,2.5398,0.5191,5.9264,4.3128,0.6775,4.5956,8.1993,1.1366,3.5796,3.46,4.5195,3.913,2.7335,0.6064,4.3087,5.316,0.5204,1.5538,3.773,2.0855,0.6789,2.9956,2.8299,4.8631,2.6316,6.3091,0.3632,0.8781,5.8154,0.4851,1.3527,2.4596,0.7776,4.709,4.1462,2.4085,3.3316,2.24,0.2702,3.823,2.8439,6.5351,2.1381,6.4914,3.9099,2.8063,0.4975,3.0462,0.2237,2.4117,1.8504,6.5754,4.9212,1.9149,6.6285,1.3777,6.4623,0.5835,1.354,4.4622,0.4692,1.5207,4.2187,2.3542,1.5178,4.6516,1.1301,1.7281,1.748,5.0117,2.5546,0.7259,2.1444,4.1846,6.1042,2.2373,1.4175,3.661,0.648,0.656,2.0525,0.2997,4.6452,4.6118,3.4305,3.0617,2.0424,1.7981,2.6171,0.7144,2.024,3.4731,4.4368,0.9988,2.7924,0.8627,2.9366,3.5473,2.587,0.8044,1.2226,2.2457,2.5471,1.3562,1.4158,3.8441,0.6981,2.5329,4.0896,1.2029,1.6778,5.8335,1.2436,1.7645,3.2808,5.4612,0.7819,0.1796,11.759,1.2095,4.6598,3.7443,0.0005,1.5921,0.3061,5.6205,4.5423,1.6354,4.3212,0.0335,2.1909,2.2306,3.7461,1.6889,1.6466,1.7476,6.4593,2.6913,0.0109,0.0789,3.88,3.6525,1.0931,1.4962,3.8251,3.0113,2.1187,3.4989,0.0214,2.9899,1.0655,0.7516,0.8232,2.4631,6.5988,5.3411,7.1226,0.0022,1.6766,4.2276,0.5947,0.9489,0.141,1.167,4.8598,1.421,1.9363,2.6337,1.3817,7.0957,4.7031,1.3143,1.2129,2.3285,4.0606,2.3069,1.1596,5.5717,2.1515,1.8267,0.9449,5.7493,0.0226,2.3654,0.697,1.6647,6.1527,0.6503,0.036,0.0674,1.8804,2.3051,3.1263,3.2195,0.0056,0.0401,2.1795,1.0234,0.7108,1.3627,3.2756,1.1038,1.2286,0.6855,4.1162,6.6958,4.909,1.1514,7.0211,0.3598,0.9628,1.1554,3.5188,4.6496,0.1473,0.8812,0.4889,3.133,0.6798,3.9767,0.9751,3.4243,6.3167,0.4813,1.1398,2.2923,1.7527,3.6319,0.679,4.7922,5.6717,2.3338,2.8629,1.1198,3.9763,2.008,0.1602,4.2211,2.5311,0.4749,0.0066,2.2149,2.0955,1.092,1.0478,3.705,2.1599,2.2116,3.7184,2.1579,2.4309,0.8496,1.9693,8.6199,1.57,4.6019,4.6609,3.0895,1.7276,1.7065,0.3372,0.517,2.6397,3.5219,2.5047,0.4223,1.8273,2.0489,4.7451,1.1722,0.9456,1.2734,2.3986,3.2031,1.9157,2.1212,0.2691,3.7452,0.5178,3.733,0.0036,3.1098,0.0023,0.0925,1.2272,2.4839,0.5063,3.2569,3.3782,5.0348,1.2471,5.8379,0.3105,4.0,0.8117,1.0171,1.4706,1.1948,5.0173,0.122,0.5878,3.6887,4.9418,1.0979,1.8015,5.7763,2.74,2.2959,2.2655,2.9735,5.7325,5.5525,5.5691,4.2559,2.1651,

{"prompt":"Former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , prosecutors said , adding that he had spoken with a top member of Trump \u2019","text":"Former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prosecutors said, adding that he had spoken with a top member of Trump \u2019 s intelligence team ahead of the 2016 election. Flynn has argued that he was merely defending the president \u2014 a claim the government disputes. The plea in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019 s investigation appeared to undermine Flynn\u2019s claim the president wanted to keep his ties to Russia to himself, a legal strategy intended to convince the jury his conduct was strictly loyal service. Flynn told the FBI before 2016 that he had spoken with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and the Russian general Sergei Skripal during a dinner with their spouses, prosecutors said Friday, and that he had not mentioned those conversations to Trump. But the government said it was later revealed that Flynn told investigators he had made the disclosure ahead of their meeting that summer. \u201c Michael Flynn told the U.S. Justice Department he had not told the president about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak and Mr. Skripal until after the dinner party and had not made their discussions public, \u201d the government charged. Flynn was the second person in Trump \u2019 s administration to face criminal charges. Attorney General William P Barr was prosecuted Wednesday after he lied to the FBI about his contact with Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Prosecutors said Flynn lied about that contact that summer not to protect Trump but because the president asked him not to mention it, arguing the administration would suffer from the disclosure. Trump also has said Flynn \u2019 s actions in the Ukraine affair were loyal service. \u201c Michael Flynn did what Michael Flynn was supposed to do, \u201d Trump said on Friday while appearing with Flynn in the Oval Office. \u201c He was supposed to stay out of it. He lied. He lied about the President. He lied. As far as I \u2019 m concerned \u2013 not loyal service. I thought that. He lied. \u201d\n\u201c Donald Trump has been ordered to leave office at noon on Monday, following a dramatic day in which impeachment talks in Congress and his resignation request were revealed. Trump \u2019 s defense team is being urged to plead guilty to the two impeachment charges, including \u2018incitement of insurrection \u2019 so that if convicted, Trump will serve one to two years, prosecutors say. Trump \u2019 s attorneys asked the White House last week to have a lawyer present for Trump to make his plea. \u201d\nDonald Trump is officially going into exile. He is leaving his job. His office is being searched. His secretary and personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is in jail. He had to resign. Even he is having a tough time with this. He is not sure why he had to resign. He got into it with some of his minions. He also blamed Russia for the attack in our Capitol. The president is losing his mind over this whole impeachment show, he is not letting it go. He has lost control and his team is working desperately to save his career.\nThe president can \u2019 t seem to stop accusing his political opponents of conspiring against him. He claims he was informed of Russian meddling in the election and is now being investigated by the FBI. The media is reporting the president is taking his own advice and is now looking for the help he is going to need.\nA special counsel in Washington is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the relationship between Ukraine and the Trump campaign. The president is insisting Ukraine should do more to investigate Trump and his family amid a long-standing case that he pressured the government there to investigate a political foe. This came the same day that House impeachment managers charged in the impeachment process.\nDemocrats and reporters will be closely watching the impeachment proceedings, but the president is clearly not ready to hand over in any way. He is demanding that the special counsel be removed from the investigation because he believes he is the one who is getting it wrong.","token_len":797,"entropy":[5.9311,0.1162,0.0386,0.0438,5.7708,0.3652,0.3371,1.4906,0.0045,4.7765,1.9956,4.7792,0.1221,0.1176,0.1831,0.0978,0.2368,7.0572,0.0509,0.0009,0.0062,2.9582,5.0782,0.2239,3.2269,3.3646,0.4197,1.0104,2.4275,5.3982,1.2283,2.5367,3.0011,5.3256,0.0276,1.8477,18.4266,7.7127,8.6049,4.3249,0.7983,6.5938,0.0005,0.6529,2.5053,0.5749,0.5432,1.9674,3.5814,7.4254,0.408,0.9272,2.0673,4.2493,6.6583,1.7744,0.5449,5.7275,2.156,2.154,3.3046,2.7902,4.4757,0.2057,2.5832,2.0194,5.7039,2.4451,5.9439,0.9717,6.9414,0.0527,9.1164,2.9038,8.454,1.0964,7.7896,0.3014,5.7621,2.7142,2.8665,0.1696,0.9111,3.6428,6.2001,0.9568,4.7947,0.4674,3.0527,1.9209,5.1439,0.2516,0.3777,4.213,3.7266,1.9651,3.0266,4.1774,5.514,7.0954,0.017,5.9803,1.1649,5.422,5.9437,4.7822,0.5202,6.094,7.332,11.2851,0.8279,2.8577,3.8452,0.9687,1.9872,6.6667,8.3706,0.397,0.2361,1.0681,2.7298,0.3885,3.8401,2.5128,0.8709,0.3245,0.0019,2.4027,3.8542,1.2541,7.0103,4.2857,8.2931,0.123,0.0021,3.8783,2.7476,3.3475,3.2631,6.695,5.5587,1.6779,4.3935,0.1087,5.23,3.0514,1.9173,0.6697,0.8392,1.2827,2.8727,4.4678,3.2064,1.1492,1.0497,2.8215,1.3578,3.6922,1.8874,2.0231,2.523,2.0192,1.8676,7.3371,3.5269,0.3968,1.3707,3.4884,4.2047,1.3114,0.5796,3.998,1.9746,6.1086,6.0595,0.0031,4.5542,1.3199,4.3119,5.7571,0.7624,7.8656,5.0239,8.1828,0.2626,4.9648,1.1509,3.5618,0.0014,0.0045,0.0046,3.1494,0.0072,2.8219,1.7304,2.511,2.9391,1.357,3.8238,0.7165,1.2161,1.5506,0.2172,5.9819,0.1632,0.1672,1.8493,2.607,0.0002,0.0414,0.0001,0.0029,5.5784,0.9293,0.7632,5.6712,8.3012,2.9424,2.5273,0.8935,4.2137,5.8664,4.9254,0.114,1.0821,13.8123,5.935,2.1182,1.4006,5.1522,0.5416,2.9001,2.458,4.1775,3.3368,1.2505,2.2362,1.9504,4.6168,0.541,0.1563,2.5529,0.2221,2.7355,0.6875,0.0433,3.048,3.6345,0.0357,10.9227,5.0461,19.3496,4.3821,6.4086,6.1801,3.8734,1.2861,3.9494,0.4055,0.5697,0.623,0.4081,1.0695,3.3173,0.013,4.9683,6.5257,0.0551,0.0139,4.9437,1.1574,4.0602,0.0151,1.7497,3.5337,1.0597,2.5933,2.3058,1.7195,4.1358,2.1433,7.1282,2.058,8.8694,2.3034,6.3242,2.8757,4.7488,2.9149,3.0249,2.2857,4.3088,0.8187,2.8744,0.0035,7.2795,0.5942,3.415,6.3936,2.8608,4.8183,3.1259,5.7584,1.9037,2.7244,5.8306,0.8327,3.314,3.7937,4.1054,2.1786,3.41,9.1198,0.0837,0.0159,3.6165,2.7646,1.0395,6.0848,7.1858,0.9212,10.4506,1.1916,1.0375,4.5634,0.3654,3.2164,0.3056,4.6035,7.7041,5.2658,1.1131,4.0027,1.8123,0.0006,0.2557,1.4497,3.5158,1.1034,4.501,1.7302,2.9251,1.5229,7.1223,4.0666,3.5683,5.0704,2.6548,1.4907,0.7931,0.01,0.7414,2.4413,0.3542,2.8213,3.0568,3.459,0.0016,5.347,1.6808,0.0356,2.6479,1.2009,1.8126,3.7198,1.5472,1.0642,1.7834,2.5875,2.5466,5.6772,1.6974,0.9229,0.4768,1.8471,5.6898,4.0281,0.1006,1.5833,7.7558,1.5168,4.0794,1.0487,7.6607,5.1345,8.2608,0.679,1.6995,1.33,4.6996,2.2185,4.4708,2.8864,2.7805,0.6919,2.6634,2.8556,3.962,11.9362,1.6063,4.8939,0.4454,2.7679,2.6944,5.761,0.3991,4.1646,3.2524,4.2219,5.184,1.3286,2.1811,1.0939,5.5135,1.5048,5.7673,2.7435,0.9379,0.1342,9.0156,5.2751,3.4181,0.9387,3.454,3.9939,5.4671,9.2337,1.2428,8.0636,0.8,3.459,1.9902,0.1303,0.0555,6.9604,1.1408,2.9504,4.8805,4.7295,0.5398,6.2203,0.1331,0.6605,4.0814,5.8844,8.9931,0.57,1.6366,3.8054,11.2758,5.3201,7.5523,2.8339,3.1582,9.0576,3.3852,0.6607,6.5092,0.7133,5.3792,3.5666,1.0825,3.3355,2.3082,4.0992,3.6591,5.4403,1.5131,0.2441,4.0056,3.9381,2.7508,0.097,3.348,1.7174,0.0234,0.0948,3.0637,4.4801,1.4004,5.5329,0.0018,3.6408,0.4438,0.4659,5.9279,2.4929,4.4153,0.8383,1.7635,4.448,2.5693,4.041,2.2212,0.9008,1.1208,3.9255,2.0666,1.8168,5.5524,0.0795,2.7939,6.1805,5.0564,3.461,5.7313,2.1503,2.2718,1.5972,4.3258,2.072,3.8384,3.4915,2.6894,5.3423,1.2313,1.7378,4.1704,1.318,1.1916,6.83,4.6777,6.2868,1.6919,2.9155,2.6393,0.0889,0.4169,1.6881,3.1241,1.5003,0.5466,2.1989,5.4087,3.167,2.7311,2.9193,5.9599,4.7851,2.316,4.8767,2.1626,3.3847,0.1735,3.0769,3.1196,1.2162,2.4355,1.4978,3.1675,4.4852,3.3356,1.0727,4.7848,0.3062,1.7626,0.5798,1.2079,6.1682,3.4143,3.0722,1.3657,3.6874,1.6856,0.6513,6.0859,0.7835,1.0784,5.2333,6.9984,2.704,0.6151,1.3174,3.8016,1.9301,7.4348,7.1945,1.0842,3.3263,2.4601,2.1169,5.296,1.2716,1.9635,4.012,0.9815,4.3883,7.7259,8.3368,2.8517,2.5454,3.0627,2.2327,5.1147,1.8638,0.5338,0.5789,1.2863,2.0748,3.129,2.6723,3.5047,2.9807,3.5634,0.6159,5.4185,5.2476,0.1957,4.8067,1.894,3.4064,0.2734,2.0267,3.0236,2.7879,4.7769,7.8931,1.3926,4.2555,8.6361,1.4708,7.3255,8.4943,2.3694,4.0517,1.1622,0.2034,4.464,1.5421,0.0957,0.8669,1.4102,6.2324,1.6131,2.78,6.2183,1.4928,4.2388,1.7793,1.0979,0.2787,0.6975,1.8226,3.6764,2.8818,3.5231,1.4813,1.4369,0.5108,0.7693,0.8127,2.7235,4.5622,1.4247,1.9109,2.8617,1.4046,1.1009,5.1375,2.8874,2.3616,2.442,1.4926,1.9164,3.1163,3.9255,1.6507,3.0084,4.3268,2.5015,3.2895,4.9089,0.0255,0.2341,1.3139,2.3028,4.523,5.1535,0.4011,5.1235,2.8958,1.0193,4.1768,1.2291,3.7902,0.4543,0.0116,0.4343,0.5412,2.0109,6.1151,0.0533,8.6943,0.2222,1.4431,0.5814,0.2613,0.5861,1.5647,2.5271,1.7293,6.463,8.1516,3.444,5.464,1.3207,0.1757,4.8529,3.4368,1.8454,2.025,4.8554,7.7279,2.6814,5.464,1.1557,1.4074,6.6797,2.6857,

{"prompt":"A Kuwaiti court handed several lawmakers jail terms on Monday for forcing their way into the parliament building in 2011 - a move that could cause political turbulence in the Gulf Arab region s most","text":"A Kuwaiti court handed several lawmakers jail terms on Monday for forcing their way into the parliament building in 2011 - a move that could cause political turbulence in the Gulf Arab region s most populous country and could hurt the reformist group the National Progressive Fronts (NFP).\nThe sentences were handed following the verdicts handed down in two separate trials, in which parliamentarians said they were beaten and subjected to interrogations, a judicial source told AFP in Baghdad.\nOn the pretext of an investigation led into the theft of a vehicle belonging to a member of parliament, a court summoned the leaders of the NFP, who held a sit-in at the parliament building for a few months in 2011.\nThe trial, held in Baghdad's capital's Supreme Court on Monday morning, was open to the public and lasted several hours. Following the hearing, a judge issued the verdicts, which were made public later.\n\"They are accused of committing an unlawful entrance into the parliament building, a serious offence that led to the detention of several people. But they didn't want to admit to their guilt, saying they were beaten in the interrogation,\" the judge stated.\nThe NFP's leadership called the judgment a \"thesis trial\", and described it as \"unjust\" and \"abusive\". The NFP condemned the sentence and called for an international commission of investigation to be created to determine the facts surrounding the case.\nNFP leader Ibrahim al-Nimr, his deputy Khalil al-Shammari, a member of parliament and four other men were sentenced to four years in prison, and a sixth person to three years.\nMeanwhile, a second trial in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh followed the first one in which the leaders of the NFP were found guilty of \"using violence and illegal force\" against security forces.\nNFP's executive board member and former vice president Asaad al-Shammari said that the verdicts, which he said had been handed down on Saturday in Riyadh's district court, were not in keeping with the laws of the Kingdom and that they represented a violation of the court's laws and procedures.\nAl-Shammari said that a panel of lawyers would be working to fight the sentences. He also warned that the verdicts would be appealed.\nThe verdicts in both cases are a major setback for the reformist group, which has been widely accused of attempting to force its way into parliament buildings on occasion.\nIn January, the court found the same group guilty of \"illegal entry\" into the parliament via a window of an office and ordered one of its members, Mohammed al-Ahmad, to serve 12 months' imprisonment.\nThe NFP has suffered from several setbacks recently, with the resignations of its executive board members and its membership in the lower house of parliament being suspended. Last week, the kingdom's High Authority for National Elections announced that the elections for the lower house of parliament, as well as local elections in four provinces, had been postponed due to security fears following an attack on the headquarters of one party's group within parliament.\nThe NFP, a coalition of 15 political parties led by former prime minister Mussa Safa, said earlier that the verdicts in the two trials were \"vindictive\" and \"unjust\" and that they will file an appeal against them. The NFP has also been under investigation by the Kingdom's Interior Ministry for violating security laws.\nThe verdicts come at a time when the NFP has been facing more than ever internal splits and disagreements as it tries to restore some of its credibility.\nIts own report on human rights violations has accused the interior ministry of torturing at least two of its members following their

U.S troops and allies have been waging a decade-long war to fight Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq, and U.S. President Donald Trump \u2019 s top national security aides pushed back on Monday against U.S. lawmakers calling for a new congressional war authorization, saying it would be a mistake to impose geographic or time restrictions on U.S. troops who go into countries other than those where they are fighting.\nBENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation outlook for 2018 has been revised downwards a single point, from 6 per cent to 5 per cent, but projections for the year remain unchanged, the central bank said on Friday.\nThe key factor in the revised outlook is the increase in the impact of the tax-inclusive price index on aggregate demand, said a press release.\n\"The increase in tax-inclusive prices, which reflects higher input cost of goods and services, has increased the potential extent of any reduction in the inflation outlook in 2018-19 and the inflation outlook has been revised down by a single percentage point,\" the RBI said.\nAccording to it, given the anticipated increase in tax-inclusive prices and the possible increase in the supply of labour as a consequence, the level of inflation is expected to be slightly higher than the one projected in July in future.\n\"The projection for the year ahead is unchanged. The projection for real growth in GDP for 2018-19 is at 6 per cent, at constant prices as was reported in the July revision,\" it said.\nThe inflation projections for 2018-19 have been revised down a single percentage point to 5 per cent.\n\"Inflation is projected to pick up to 5.1 per cent in March 2018 but the impact of higher tax-inclusive prices (reflecting the impact of higher input cost of goods and services) and higher cost of inflation-linked insurance will dampen the inflationary pressure. The projections have been revised slightly downwards,\" the announcement said.\nThe key factors in the revised outlook are the increase in the impact of the tax-inclusive price index on aggregate demand, the increase in projected inflation linked insurance contribution, the anticipated increase in labour supply, and the increase in the supply of labour.\nThe increase in the tax-inclusive price index reflected higher input cost of goods and services, and other inflationary pressures like higher cost of inflation-linked insurance, rising real wages and demand related price pressures will dampen the inflationary pressure and increase the gap between the actual and underlying inflation, the RBI said.\n\"The projected gap will fall over the year,\" the press release added.\nThe central bank said the projection for inflation in 2017-18 has been revised to 2.1 per cent over the June projection of 2.8 per cent. Thus, the gap between the actual and underlying inflation in 2017-18 is projected to be 1.7 per cent of the GDP.\nThe projections have not changed for 2016-17 which is still revised down to 12 per cent of GDP.\nTax-inclusive prices, which includes consumption taxes (like import and sales taxes), are key drivers of inflation, and will have a larger than previously projected impact on aggregate demand. The level of actual inflation is likely to be higher than the one projected in July due to these factors, the RBI said.\nIt cautioned that the higher cost of inflation-linked insurance and a possible

{"prompt":"Peace and stability must be restored in Myanmar s northern Rakhine state before any Rohingyas can return from Bangladesh , under international standards on voluntary repatriation , the United Nations refugee agency ( UNHCR )","text":"Peace and stability must be restored in Myanmar s northern Rakhine state before any Rohingyas can return from Bangladesh, under international standards on voluntary repatriation, the United Nations refugee agency ( UNHCR ) said on Thursday (Dec 17). China has been pressuring Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi government to stop the violence in Rakhine state amid accusations from the country's main foreign envoy that the Burmese leader had given lip service to the country's minorities without achieving much. A Reuters investigation found that while the government said there were no religious persecutions or abuses, police were involved in killings of men and women accused of being Rohingya in towns, schools and border posts. A Reuters investigation has found that police were involved in killings of men and women accused of being Rohingya in border posts, schools and towns in Rakhine state, Burma's northern border with Bangladesh, and a human rights group said it supported the calls for police to be investigated for their role. Mr Zhao Lijian, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, gave his first interview in nine months following the arrest of the Burmese Nobel laureate on Tuesday. He said the country's main foreign envoy had repeatedly urged Myanmar to let the international community see to it that there is no forced migration of persons from Myanmar into Bangladesh. \" This is a serious violation of international and universal standards of human rights, and will not be tolerated,\" he said, without elaborating. Reuters did not immediately find Mr Zhao on his official Twitter or Facebook accounts. Mr Zhao, a former Chinese ambassador to Japan and Myanmar, was also the main spokesman in 2010 when Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested following months of protests. He was then replaced by U Thaung Tun, a former Burmese ambassador in Bangkok who said he had spoken on the phone to Suu Kyi, who he described as a strong leader. \" Under Burma s current policies, Rohingya women are unable to bear children. When they are forced to return home, they will have to bear children, which will cause the Rohingya population to decline,\" said Mr Than Zaw Thu, vice chairman of Burma s national council for the rights of the Rohingya. On Wednesday, the UN human rights protection agency said the government in Naypyidaw must immediately end its policies of \" repression and discrimination against the Rohingya \". A report issued in September in Geneva by the Asian Regional Forum on Population and Development found that almost 1,000 people were killed since early 2017 in attacks on Rohingya settlements and areas in Rakhine, with nearly 60,000 displaced. According to a UNHCR report in November, the violence against the Rohingya population has forced nearly 200,000 of them - about a quarter of the remaining 7.7 million people in the country - to flee their homes. The United Nations refugee agency said at the time that \" the conflict in Arakan is causing substantial suffering for the Rohingya populations and continues to be one of the most intractable human rights and humanitarian challenges in the region.\" In Bangladesh, the Rohingya have no legal protection under the Bangladesh Constitution, as they have no birth certificate, they are not recognized in census data and they are not considered citizens. Myanmar's main Rohingya leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested on Tuesday on fraud and other charges. At least 53 persons have been killed, including 22 police officers, and more than 1,000 have been wounded in a crackdown on the mainly Muslim minority since September, police sources said. The government has accused Rohingya militants of perpetrating the violence - accusations the Rohingya have denied. More than 1 million Rohingya people live on Bangladesh s border with Myanmar on the northeastern coast. A new government s crackdown on the Rohingya has triggered widespread fears of ethnic cleansing and a possible return to a dark period in which the vast majority of the community was marginalized, with its members often treated as non-Burman refugees at the hands of the military junta from 1962.","token_len":798,"entropy":[3.5115,6.2623,6.2873,0.755,3.2982,2.6625,5.9722,12.0071,6.333,4.4812,0.0091,0.0004,0.887,6.2231,2.7063,8.4252,0.0067,0.0003,2.0703,3.0035,4.492,2.1871,2.0919,5.6045,3.909,7.4087,6.5936,8.0461,1.5865,0.0073,1.6577,2.3414,3.2729,0.0147,3.455,0.0122,3.1563,9.2061,0.1231,0.5371,0.9132,2.0022,2.9438,3.1505,4.1769,0.1599,7.8763,1.9306,2.4083,5.1517,0.2613,2.9582,7.145,2.5061,0.0001,0.0005,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,1.4856,0.2781,4.0945,1.6791,4.923,2.5379,2.2787,0.0002,0.0022,1.9301,5.7587,5.7254,3.8526,1.926,2.854,0.0506,4.1386,6.1414,7.4171,0.6189,1.5305,6.2156,0.0047,0.0,3.2038,3.7912,5.5745,7.7657,0.03,0.0341,1.3603,2.973,0.0313,5.1937,8.744,6.9841,4.8611,1.8551,3.7177,5.7818,2.186,1.927,0.5312,5.1594,1.9925,2.0999,5.2294,3.645,0.9245,0.7311,7.4702,7.6731,0.3163,0.0004,2.4449,4.8368,1.5395,7.0092,3.3371,4.3316,0.1207,3.6583,1.5149,7.3186,1.2659,0.4845,3.6095,0.0144,1.9584,0.9726,3.0597,6.2593,3.2225,4.7233,0.4435,6.6398,2.1216,0.5883,2.9547,3.5002,0.8474,3.4437,1.2357,0.3193,3.4831,2.4755,0.6728,0.0193,1.1011,0.1378,1.6984,0.14,0.0082,0.1255,0.0004,0.0026,0.005,0.0528,11.4539,0.0504,1.804,0.237,0.0801,7.2669,4.8107,0.9358,0.002,0.0008,0.2488,1.5241,6.7455,2.7944,3.171,4.6189,1.2157,1.1128,1.4123,1.6452,3.5467,5.7022,0.0104,0.6175,1.0432,4.5553,6.8426,1.2629,6.1589,0.7318,6.5908,0.7316,0.9237,3.7996,1.9673,3.1845,0.6485,2.5776,6.1502,8.8952,8.1672,2.3593,3.0089,0.2193,4.3965,0.0492,4.415,0.6786,0.2439,0.1199,6.4016,4.2687,3.2717,4.1192,2.2524,5.347,0.8281,5.5844,1.0271,5.4855,0.4243,2.1335,2.3579,0.0031,0.0,6.5976,2.0859,1.9887,3.1863,0.6965,1.2904,0.7601,1.5163,2.5292,1.9061,4.6743,2.3256,3.6943,1.1737,5.3671,2.1459,1.7941,0.5183,6.0516,1.161,6.1721,0.0444,4.8712,4.4376,0.1169,0.1619,3.1253,2.5755,0.4231,6.2811,3.1717,1.7651,7.0381,1.2529,1.3042,2.4754,0.2631,0.635,1.4416,9.4191,1.0296,1.4377,2.9556,2.8727,0.0841,0.8634,5.4121,7.6414,4.6896,2.0662,0.9929,0.0494,2.0069,1.3205,4.5635,1.86,0.5918,0.1456,1.1068,0.4429,0.1732,2.4187,3.5597,0.8135,0.0077,0.6229,4.5646,5.3232,0.024,2.2138,4.0608,3.2749,0.1333,3.2978,3.1058,3.9312,1.4396,6.2992,2.3687,0.5451,0.474,2.6923,0.2662,2.5306,1.6298,1.2164,4.0592,2.0132,0.2561,5.0175,2.1762,4.2567,0.2627,1.4671,3.6488,2.9664,3.9793,3.3918,3.6012,7.0582,3.1561,6.9319,4.14,0.0691,2.444,0.0005,0.0003,0.0,0.0003,0.0022,0.0018,1.1582,2.9147,5.2367,6.3415,0.0404,1.544,2.6031,3.077,0.9127,5.0652,3.744,0.2739,5.0636,9.5707,4.2648,0.1913,5.7098,0.8603,1.1437,1.4034,5.4367,0.003,0.0,2.0964,3.7128,3.6352,1.856,4.8408,1.9356,1.4008,4.441,4.5503,1.7227,0.4372,2.316,7.0374,0.0064,0.0052,0.0029,2.9465,1.8547,4.127,2.2176,0.0321,0.8782,4.9765,1.6866,1.1067,3.0608,9.7273,5.5228,4.1544,3.5313,4.7683,0.5985,3.9296,4.8735,1.3819,5.9403,0.0497,5.5688,0.949,2.4025,5.2017,1.9167,1.6155,2.8781,0.3548,3.791,2.16,0.601,0.7341,2.8894,2.6033,1.0716,3.4505,2.1549,2.5067,3.0041,1.6873,2.99,3.5946,3.7364,3.14,0.2034,3.5861,1.2378,2.906,1.3358,8.3628,5.3871,3.4796,7.7174,0.3228,5.8793,2.1706,0.0796,3.8923,6.8999,3.6872,2.45,1.9643,3.2408,2.2134,0.6592,1.9984,0.3847,0.7586,5.3335,1.839,0.3386,1.8241,1.9727,3.1527,0.0091,6.9281,0.719,0.9811,2.2572,2.9512,3.0135,5.3647,0.0044,0.3524,0.0009,4.2689,4.2467,2.2251,1.4645,5.2812,0.5577,2.6815,12.4864,1.1971,2.2623,1.3556,0.9632,0.2534,4.6229,3.2794,3.5371,3.0168,2.8419,2.7816,5.0657,3.5086,1.6427,0.5811,7.3004,4.7006,4.237,0.4181,6.3622,1.0598,0.2146,4.3098,0.3175,5.3126,2.9237,0.9049,1.0419,1.7501,1.9091,2.0833,3.7851,4.1522,4.7227,1.2044,3.7718,0.7223,1.6951,5.5989,1.8705,5.6449,1.8941,0.8846,0.0004,0.0014,3.4509,4.4363,3.6776,4.2356,1.1146,0.0036,2.6224,1.0464,5.1191,0.001,2.7097,2.6645,0.6002,3.0516,2.9483,0.2543,2.1996,3.8574,3.2369,0.8582,0.1261,2.8883,1.7667,4.3705,3.5405,3.9254,0.0556,0.0014,4.2264,0.2034,6.6906,2.8782,3.0847,1.4306,0.1564,0.6497,7.5824,4.4903,1.1166,2.3296,0.0137,2.2696,1.3695,1.9468,0.2367,0.2541,0.2406,0.4657,0.9699,0.0718,0.8818,1.7978,3.1178,0.0959,2.9016,0.012,0.8401,3.6778,1.2807,0.0603,0.3814,2.9304,4.5998,5.6339,0.9977,7.7212,0.0537,0.0097,2.1201,4.9919,3.4671,1.6078,2.4655,0.8383,0.7883,5.1727,1.7368,7.5497,0.0962,3.1898,4.2728,0.0171,0.0351,0.8512,4.9336,0.0138,0.0003,3.2477,0.0909,3.6079,0.8281,3.6818,1.7214,0.4771,1.1686,1.8383,3.2497,6.2027,0.2518,1.9236,1.9987,1.4086,6.1312,2.4728,3.684,1.9024,1.1562,3.3447,3.3968,0.9668,4.2807,2.4107,1.9334,1.7724,7.7166,2.0587,1.2596,4.8915,1.178,1.5959,3.908,4.3906,7.358,2.031,0.6173,1.7127,1.0583,1.2155,3.198,2.925,1.0865,3.1013,1.1987,4.0488,5.622,3.3663,4.7646,3.5686,2.882,0.0215,0.5293,0.0017,0.0002,0.0004,0.0005,0.0014,0.0019,2.2812,1.5553,0.9778,2.0029,2.5893,8.5603,2.7947,3.0671,0.1398,1.4683,5.1468,1.3145,5.8844,5.3984,1.0924,0.2132,1.4745,2.636,1.4156,4.7735,4.4333,0.3731,0.6683,2.5306,1.9503,0.015,2.6988,0.0192,1.0934,3.009,0.1923,1.9579,1.6582,3.2035,2.5875,0.6335,1.5212,5.9875,0.4227,2.4509,3.1621,4.1347,1.7389,5.3265,3.9581,0.3649,0.2769,1.732,2.2694,1.1345,3.5837,2.193,2.3495,0.22,5.0129,0.0058,2.1825,0.5437,5.4107,6.5705,1.9695,3.0457,1.5793,0.5866,

{"prompt":"The leadership of the largest group of Republican conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Thursday it opposed the deal President Donald Trump struck with Democrats to tie together legislation to provide hurricane","text":"The leadership of the largest group of Republican conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Thursday it opposed the deal President Donald Trump struck with Democrats to tie together legislation to provide hurricane relief.\nA spokesman for U.S. House Republican leadership John Boehner of Ohio said no legislation to be voted on this week that funds aid for Hurricane Harvey in Texas did not involve a compromise by Republicans.\n\"With respect to the House Republican majority leader's declaration last week that the House GOP opposes the Senate bill that will fund hurricane relief, I am disappointed that he appears to lack knowledge of our position,\" said a statement from the party.\nIn a statement, Boehner said, \"We were clear from the beginning -- a lot of times in politics, we have to take a risk, and I'm not gonna run that risk here because the House Republicans aren't trying to rush to agreement on any bill that is passed for hurricanes.\"\nHe added, \"We want to hear the president's proposal that will end this discussion which has gone on for far too long and not really get to the heart of anything.\"\nRepublicans on the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee said in a statement that they supported the bill that provided $4.4 billion in federal aid to states and counties impacted by Harvey.\n\"We welcome the president's willingness to accept the compromise bill for funding the relief effort,\" the committee said.\nLast week, the Democratic-controlled Senate approved bipartisan legislation that would provide $2.8 billion in emergency relief to victims of the worst-scattered storm in U.S. history, giving money to those affected by the Harvey disaster and offering loans for home repairs from the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agencies.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada announced the Senate plan on Monday after meeting with House members, including Rep. Devin Nunes of California, chairman of the House committee that handled the disaster relief proposal.\nNunes said earlier Monday he was pleased the president appeared willing to reopen the negotiations, as the House Republican leadership said he should do.\nNunes, Boehner and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have all been criticizing Trump for refusing to sign a $400 billion disaster aid bill that they have been pressing him to accept for a week.\nThe House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on the deal that would provide $14 billion over four years to help the recovery of homeowners, renters, states, counties and cities from the damage caused by Harvey.\nThe House Republicans called the deal a \"tokenistic gesture from Trump to meet his pledge that he would work with Democrats to pass a comprehensive, bipartisan disaster relief package.\"\nThe National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday that Harvey has crossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, as the storm turned from an extratropical storm into a tropical storm this weekend.\nHarvey, a Category 4 hurricane, was about 240 miles (350 kilometers) west-southwest of the Texas coast at the northernmost tip of the Houston metropolitan area on Wednesday. A Category 3 hurricane has weakened to a 2.5-mile (4 kilometers) storm since Tuesday, with damage from the heavy rain and wind spreading from Texas to Louisiana and Mississippi.\nHarvey's eye has moved across central Texas, destroying crops and infrastructure while killing at least 16 people, mostly in the Houston area.\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called the U.S. National Hurricane Center an \"incompetent joke\" and warned that the agency should face \"serious consequences\".\nThe president, a hurricane fanatic, called the news about Harvey \"very, very, very sad news,\" and
