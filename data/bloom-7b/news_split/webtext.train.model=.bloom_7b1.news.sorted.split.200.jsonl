The payroll tax is about 1.3 percent of payroll. Most people believe that taxes on payroll increase worker compensation. Since employers have a financial incentive to avoid payroll taxes, some have suggested that a change to the payroll tax could help reduce labor costs.\nFor years, business groups have argued that lower payroll taxes would help companies hire and retain workers by giving them more money to pay their employees, rather than having to pay a portion of that money in the form of federal taxes. The idea is that workers would get more money from their employer to help them buy health insurance.","token_len":203,"entropy":[7.2496,0.5565,0.0441,0.0809,6.1638,6.1437,7.6594,7.7545,2.698,5.9086,0.1545,0.327,6.2393,2.381,0.062,4.9236,0.9842,4.2899,0.167,0.0802,0.9934,7.3659,1.604,2.516,3.4373,5.5838,2.5564,4.5971,2.245,4.8641,0.027,0.8059,2.4208,7.2455,1.0641,0.9633,0.5396,4.0554,2.7692,0.0506,2.5028,3.1206,6.287,1.3332,0.1562,1.0164,4.3785,0.0032,0.0003,1.9178,5.2507,3.0577,0.6811,0.9216,0.2801,17.1718,6.2363,1.7752,6.0817,2.644,1.9685,3.5812,6.4878,2.7046,2.9916,0.2505,0.3212,0.6672,3.9588,4.7337,5.5512,4.3566,2.0207,7.5579,3.5047,2.1819,1.2819,4.1426,6.8759,12.1864,3.616,2.392,1.1351,2.3612,4.0377,7.538,0.6544,1.9656,4.3695,0.2832,1.7352,5.985,3.6394,1.183,2.8066,0.2735,0.4042,3.9647,2.5316,5.9413,3.291,5.0945,1.057,6.7043,0.7769,2.9526,6.0616,7.7643,3.6761,1.9871,6.2455,4.8056,3.1241,2.0475,4.6532,0.7125,0.0571,4.4435,3.7926,0.135,0.3952,3.9886,3.4695,2.7515,0.8182,2.8346,3.2407,0.7605,0.2068,0.6245,0.0394,1.6589,2.763,2.6341,4.9833,0.2083,0.8072,0.4421,4.5798,4.1549,0.1146,3.6309,1.3271,0.7869,2.3193,0.1234,4.4726,2.0367,0.1894,0.8441,2.6063,4.6097,3.7903,2.6574,0.3603,0.7592,4.668,4.1087,0.5444,1.1625,2.9368,0.9974,2.0776,2.2393,2.0871,2.3213,3.5891,0.0211,4.4594,1.1151,0.5584,3.1647,4.3386,0.0433,2.3826,0.7934,2.8631,3.6649,0.0939,0.0022,5.3501,1.7241,0.2536,2.4228,3.5711,1.0831,0.5682,3.4756,1.1999,3.2889,1.2929,1.4597,2.3345,1.5058,1.8058,2.2613,3.9439,1.9114,4.1036,5.9434,0.1517,2.0606]}

It also includes another $2 trillion in funding for states, territories and localities and another $300 billion for infrastructure projects.\nBut the stimulus also makes it easier for people to skip a big deduction on their 2021 federal income tax returns. The law increases the deduction limits for business meals and entertainment at private clubs and entertainment venues. The limit on the number of charitable contributions you can deduct also goes up, but the total amount of those contributions don't increase. Congress has also raised the amount you can give back to some eligible charities.","token_len":203,"entropy":[5.0829,6.2399,6.88,4.0289,0.0079,0.0063,0.0064,3.0354,7.7578,6.3507,3.0635,0.317,1.1167,4.9348,2.5075,1.2999,4.1995,0.8628,0.7263,1.4457,4.1651,3.8459,6.6635,4.1196,1.5992,7.6425,7.1851,1.3669,1.0545,0.6332,2.3095,1.9783,4.032,2.4519,1.8228,0.6119,8.197,1.0164,0.6879,4.6735,1.8687,2.1669,0.7945,2.464,8.9582,0.4783,19.1639,10.0721,0.3943,2.8129,5.8586,12.587,0.2988,2.652,0.2865,14.5404,4.1276,1.4414,9.4899,1.3789,2.4831,1.3726,7.1945,4.3886,1.1159,0.7749,5.458,0.236,0.1613,0.7155,4.2845,1.8165,0.0462,0.4251,4.9204,4.7114,0.3065,2.0718,1.6228,2.9702,0.031,0.3922,1.8812,3.0494,0.6481,3.685,1.496,10.8401,0.0012,0.0739,4.9859,6.7485,5.0232,2.723,0.3742,3.2894,1.7106,1.0377,4.653,0.0321,3.0922,2.769,0.8488,3.4776,0.234,6.0779,2.6074,3.8032,0.3164,1.8067,0.9905,4.3444,3.5215,0.0225,4.1648,0.7158,0.6907,5.9617,1.1317,0.4833,0.7397,4.1785,1.7365,8.6924,5.2577,5.5171,2.2638,2.319,0.2378,4.8129,0.485,7.2763,3.2722,5.7562,7.6058,4.2112,1.1027,14.9176,3.4021,1.3846,0.3865,0.9615,1.0233,1.9321,4.6947,5.5971,0.4376,1.9642,6.0576,1.1588,4.8339,9.3515,1.379,6.0561,4.6123,5.8449,5.3952,1.1379,5.2972,1.0573,1.3943,2.0985,6.5358,1.5336,2.3577,4.6132,0.0341,4.4259,0.7816,3.52,0.1415,3.8048,6.3564,1.8385,0.0795,2.1661,2.4236,1.8956,5.2829,1.6553,1.5425,3.3388,1.3909,7.5671,0.0009,2.638,1.1196,6.776,2.218,2.912,3.9896,0.5238,4.3253,2.9986,0.2097,3.7759,6.022,0.4494,6.7617,6.7107,2.1919,1.1976]}

Puigdemont and four of his ministers had fled to Belgium before the Spanish government dissolved the Catalan government and arrested its members. Puigdemont's lawyers said they intended to appeal against the decision by the courthouse in the Belgian capital of Brussels. Belgium's high court on Oct. 29 overturned the warrant against a number of Spanish suspects, ruling that their detention for rebellion was illegal. The Spain Supreme Court said the judgment on the arrest warrant had been reviewed but no decision had been taken yet. The European Union on Oct. 29 also decided the Catalan government had no standing to invoke the EU's human rights laws. The Brussels-based executive, which included Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and France, cited \"irregularities\" in Spain's constitutional system. A German court has also ruled that the arrest warrant can only be served if the European arrest warrant is granted.","token_len":207,"entropy":[11.5871,5.6368,4.6488,1.6519,1.6218,2.2809,15.9556,0.5377,2.5075,4.4046,3.7807,0.0212,2.1102,10.8076,3.8668,1.1868,0.1505,0.0001,0.0004,0.0008,0.0,0.0,1.8393,5.4041,0.0203,3.4002,1.3858,5.3761,2.6324,0.3194,1.5936,1.6547,0.1802,3.9554,0.0001,0.0009,0.0007,4.2553,5.2122,1.6123,0.0559,3.5581,4.2572,3.3486,1.2122,3.3376,4.7127,0.9919,4.2296,1.9684,6.584,0.9054,1.1877,0.6412,2.8254,6.1738,6.2548,3.4448,1.0304,3.5529,0.0002,0.0007,0.0009,1.8411,2.6139,1.0963,1.605,5.9198,0.0562,0.9631,2.0381,0.3025,1.1663,3.85,0.6299,9.7503,1.6161,2.8881,3.3332,0.2868,3.8336,0.1655,0.4682,5.6508,0.9374,5.4501,0.04,2.4426,4.7331,0.0023,3.6392,4.5233,1.015,4.959,3.4168,4.2262,4.0241,0.0007,3.8936,4.2466,1.408,3.3394,0.5756,3.7783,2.8774,5.9939,8.5709,1.1307,2.0542,0.6678,1.6347,6.5411,5.9804,0.0039,2.5352,1.649,8.1801,3.7235,1.2779,3.5435,0.9242,2.998,0.8092,6.4842,3.8265,4.57,0.8624,0.6352,0.4698,1.9698,2.4672,0.2056,1.7347,4.5511,3.3227,4.1579,3.1567,0.0016,2.3507,3.6349,4.4109,3.932,1.878,1.3138,1.6817,2.5221,4.5202,0.2235,5.6111,1.4961,3.7216,0.5415,5.0561,0.0063,3.1167,1.3091,1.4228,5.2432,2.897,0.0591,8.0919,3.7943,1.7007,5.6653,4.3962,0.8786,3.4684,0.5832,4.0539,0.6782,1.773,0.0355,6.6774,2.5706,5.4244,1.7684,0.2763,0.5597,0.4511,2.6262,0.1029,5.2712,1.8676,1.7958,3.9037,4.864,1.1274,3.6555,1.574,1.6976,0.7694,1.2748,3.7003,0.4338,5.3985,2.8016,0.126,6.391,1.6866,1.0263,4.9921,3.5853,0.1201,0.8363,3.2421,1.2035]}

Fransen is deputy leader of the British National Party, a far-right political party. A judge ruled earlier this month that Fransen, the party's treasurer, was responsible for abusing a Muslim woman at the party's annual conference in Birmingham in 2008. She told the judge she was being attacked by an Arab with a knife; the victim said she went to an officer who was supposed to be stationed nearby and that police did nothing. Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist who supports the Islamic State organization, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in London, a spokesman for the British government said.

Duterte vowed to wipe out the nation\u2019s drug problem \u2013 one of his campaign promises in the 2014 elections \u2013 in his first weeks in office. But, in an interview aired recently, he spoke out against the way government agents target drug users. In the interview, he said that many of the agents who are involved in the issue are his former comrades. Duterte said that former police officers had recently murdered several drug users. \u201c It\u2019s very unfortunate that the police are being used by criminals, including police chiefs, to intimidate or even shoot down drug users, \u201d Duterte said in the interview.

Chombo, who did not appear at the court hearing this morning, has requested bail from the Chief Magistrate, however, he was not granted bail. Chombo faces corruption charges that date back to when he worked as finance minister during the Zimbabwean military government. Chombo's former office, in particular his deputy and ex-vice chairman of Zimfin, appeared to be the most frequently visited by officials under the Gupta family. At least four former ministers were detained by police last week while they were being interrogated. A total of 14 persons were arrested by security agencies in the last three weeks with allegations of money laundering and bribery. In the wake of the political turmoil that rocked the Zimbabwean economy, former president Robert Mugabe announced the dissolution of the ruling party on July 11 and dissolved parliament on July 27. Mugabe has been seeking a snap election since the July 27 coup, when he dissolved parliament.

Its location at the heart of the region makes Algeria a strategic member of the force. The alliance, known as the G5 Sahel, was formed in January to stem the spread of violence among Islamist militants in Mali s north and west. Members of the alliance include France, Algeria, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Senegal. France has said it will withdraw its troops from Mali by the end of 2016, and the remaining forces will be transferred to the African army, though not until at least 2019. The coalition s mission, which was first announced in February, is to \" protect the life and security of citizens, promote stability and develop and implement local capacity, \" according to its website.

The tax vote still could be held in session next week or be pushed in the fall when the House holds a series of fiscal debates.\nThe tax overhaul, first introduced in 2009, is seen as essential by Democrats in part to stimulate the economy amid the global economic slump. Democrats say that the GOP proposal, which has been passed in the House, would be insufficient to move the economy out of the recession.\nBut the measure also is not likely to bring in the expected $1.5 trillion in tax revenue needed to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year next year. The $16.5 trillion in current law spending has already been raised to the level required by law. Republican efforts to raise revenues by shifting taxable income from households to corporations were shot down by House and Senate committees, and they have failed to gather enough support to push the amendment forward in the Senate.","token_len":221,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,4.6566,2.6869,1.5784,5.5819,5.4514,0.0966,1.0671,4.7988,3.1635,1.9731,4.3565,1.9634,3.9119,2.0932,10.1906,0.7764,0.0828,0.6031,9.9217,0.788,5.0946,3.1571,7.0887,0.138,10.0641,2.9567,0.0064,2.5077,5.2507,2.1772,5.9183,7.0759,0.5996,1.4972,2.6897,5.2382,4.265,0.448,2.9945,3.8686,7.1061,6.4837,3.039,1.7182,3.585,2.5179,3.3799,3.3354,0.764,2.9752,6.1852,3.7986,5.0355,0.9878,4.3042,4.2886,1.1766,1.8739,5.0045,0.6823,5.4593,0.0011,6.2656,4.6738,0.5965,0.4797,15.5157,3.0397,2.4971,2.0052,4.8282,2.2661,0.9771,2.7548,0.5876,2.5052,4.2311,0.3495,5.2857,4.6544,3.679,2.5987,5.6051,3.012,6.1794,0.7756,0.0674,4.8049,1.9918,4.0961,1.5955,4.0156,0.6448,4.2749,2.2239,3.002,2.0596,3.5925,2.9827,2.804,0.5959,3.5101,1.8434,5.7276,2.0362,1.3151,1.0803,1.3351,1.2381,3.5716,4.8811,0.5303,5.6918,1.0593,1.685,4.3207,0.0016,1.0391,1.8675,0.7971,0.3492,2.4087,2.0003,3.2539,3.3746,3.6922,4.5915,2.2803,0.0128,4.3135,2.0086,2.7527,6.0328,1.0232,1.567,0.9376,1.8032,0.014,0.8856,1.5493,1.2581,2.3661,0.2768,2.4865,0.5959,0.7145,2.1676,1.523,0.8729,0.0044,1.0627,3.0998,0.0231,3.2812,0.2268,0.4952,2.4508,4.6883,6.1927,0.4884,1.6219,0.1134,1.1071,5.8296,1.7599,5.6306,4.9054,1.9673,0.5153,3.3763,2.6228,3.5309,1.7805,2.5015,0.9895,2.1587,1.0983,6.5242,5.1389,0.1435,1.9581,4.8659,2.6312,4.9796,8.2864,0.1397,1.3304,4.4978,0.3326,1.6991,4.0394,7.0403,0.0477,0.959,3.1213,3.143,0.0124,4.4286,2.2831,1.917,3.1997,1.7096,2.2272,0.3822,5.288,0.6485,0.6341,0.8678,4.7906,1.66,6.2323,4.3181,2.5017,0.444,0.4699,0.1456]}

{"prompt":"Kim Jong Nam , the murdered half-brother of North Korea s leader , had a dozen vials of antidote for lethal nerve agent VX in his sling bag on the day he was poisoned ,","text":"Kim Jong Nam, the murdered half-brother of North Korea s leader, had a dozen vials of antidote for lethal nerve agent VX in his sling bag on the day he was poisoned, according to a security document found by prosecutors that was released Thursday. Investigators said they didn t know of a specific agent responsible or where it had been kept. But Kim Jong Nam had been preparing to take a flight to Macau with his sister Kim Yo Jong for a planned visit to a health resort before the attack. His death was the latest in a spree of nerve agent attacks that have killed many, including U.S. President Donald Trump s top national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Investigators said they were in a race with time to trace back the poison and prevent it from being used, and are relying heavily on intelligence gathered outside of North Korea. But a key source says some of the intel may be bogus because it was obtained through a friend that couldn t be cross-examined.

First, U.S. forces entered a territory where Russia has strong diplomatic, and even military, ties, and it is possible for soldiers to be sent in by one country to do military training work within the borders of a third country.\nSecond, the South Korean military is working with the U.S. and American forces in areas where nuclear weapons are present, which the Kremlin sees as a direct threat to Russian security.\nShe added that the fact the maneuvers are taking place within the boundaries of sovereign Korea \u201cdoes not meet the standards of international practice and is not safe for the entire region.\u201d","token_len":223,"entropy":[9.0279,5.9916,4.6715,4.8797,8.4896,2.1337,0.0801,0.0486,7.9551,0.0486,2.9128,5.4109,0.6867,3.189,8.2301,0.0355,6.3146,2.1639,1.2671,1.2987,5.4068,1.9023,1.4065,8.4668,2.4283,2.244,1.2738,0.0669,0.0001,0.0,0.0006,0.3757,1.4484,1.8765,0.2258,6.7517,5.9893,1.102,1.1481,1.3195,0.0563,0.5036,3.2235,2.1465,2.8461,1.1981,2.1202,0.7871,1.5325,3.0164,2.4571,6.6607,3.8092,0.2448,5.9983,4.7741,4.5047,1.0883,0.0018,0.0052,0.0838,1.1456,3.1917,2.7216,4.9439,2.3858,7.6431,21.6208,1.7462,1.1299,0.7847,0.0687,0.0014,0.0003,0.0018,3.4694,4.2123,3.0156,0.1929,0.839,6.0251,1.518,7.6781,0.3703,0.3324,4.3404,5.3702,2.3004,17.1583,6.1972,2.7895,4.0997,2.5535,9.7317,4.4879,6.549,2.0017,0.4565,0.8366,0.0475,4.2079,0.0004,0.0019,0.0769,2.3603,6.67,3.1907,4.3014,3.1225,3.6686,1.4778,4.9262,3.9559,3.8037,5.0394,3.7737,0.2984,0.1548,1.0819,1.2647,1.5694,3.3937,1.0731,4.2218,2.5844,6.2854,0.5653,2.6531,3.884,3.2832,4.7865,5.1806,1.8746,1.0541,4.1599,3.4974,3.8436,7.9312,4.8643,0.8019,4.279,0.1993,2.828,2.1029,0.4416,0.7142,2.5265,2.6187,0.0058,1.4779,3.2427,0.4279,0.8742,2.1018,5.4382,1.3214,1.1899,1.0647,0.0004,0.0052,0.2665,2.4582,6.2651,1.894,1.5279,5.1023,1.0215,7.1278,1.226,0.6513,3.6337,0.9431,3.1466,4.77,4.3789,2.5275,0.0614,1.4296,4.4122,0.4985,0.133,5.2727,1.187,0.566,0.9655,6.7106,2.1499,0.3,1.0382,6.99,3.701,4.3626,1.1018,2.0323,0.0017,3.0507,0.9109,3.3174,0.032,7.5225,5.5259,6.4471,0.1985,3.2234,0.0595,6.322,0.7813,3.785,0.5067,2.1021,5.1296,3.2906,2.0391,1.106,5.5447,0.7893,1.4467,1.6418,0.2743,2.1188,9.5753,5.702]}

Spicer said the administration would not announce a timeline for the planned trip. But the decision to send officials from the White House to Israel and Palestinian territories within days of Trump\u2019s inauguration has led to speculations of a possible announcement within weeks. Trump on Thursday declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel.\nThe Trump administration had already signaled its willingness to reengage with the region by appointing a former Saudi ambassador to succeed the late King Abdullah as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and establishing a new US ambassador in Israel. But the two officials spoke anonymously because they refused to be interviewed, while others with knowledge of the move declined to comment publicly.","token_len":224,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1657,5.9936,2.5886,2.9362,0.0926,0.0008,0.0014,0.0006,2.7257,0.0025,1.7466,16.8469,6.2272,0.5617,2.3786,0.0004,0.4481,1.8111,2.9648,0.0209,6.5262,2.0312,2.2168,7.3486,0.5798,2.3089,2.7979,3.1692,18.9994,7.0203,15.627,0.7935,10.2178,6.4108,0.3098,0.0084,0.4207,2.5496,1.5892,13.4729,7.5858,3.5709,4.1141,0.0005,0.25,7.1398,2.22,1.8219,5.3936,0.9125,0.0257,0.9666,3.781,0.7526,1.8296,0.1066,0.3233,17.897,1.4092,4.991,1.1569,2.1187,2.9083,2.4128,4.2359,3.2609,3.5096,6.8059,1.1604,7.5123,0.3097,4.3078,0.0013,3.382,0.1592,0.0,1.2805,3.1267,3.9786,1.1852,3.1457,0.5344,5.307,0.0108,2.8383,2.1103,2.7487,4.9959,3.5765,6.421,0.8965,5.4755,1.127,4.54,1.3713,1.534,1.9953,2.0633,2.5544,4.1625,2.2616,1.8061,0.631,1.405,5.8946,1.3029,1.3251,4.0886,1.9221,4.8058,1.4645,2.1073,5.8758,2.9073,0.5091,1.7958,0.0008,0.8033,3.2513,2.2361,4.3473,2.8442,6.3632,1.5003,0.5983,1.4473,10.6286,7.7523,1.7431,1.1234,2.4712,4.7049,0.4574,6.3797,0.0498,2.813,0.8312,1.3569,5.51,3.7384,1.3883,0.6203,5.1985,4.9009,1.7013,5.6558,3.2822,0.5339,0.1593,0.0388,0.1447,1.7796,0.4673,4.8006,4.2247,0.3528,4.1548,3.1924,3.0902,2.113,2.1441,0.0217,6.3459,4.5116,0.0084,0.976,1.1589,1.9793,3.3296,4.7699,1.8404,4.8651,5.103,2.1913,0.3657,8.5017,2.2589,2.3711,1.9766,0.3486,2.9829,1.6382,0.4991,0.94,0.3188,2.3809,0.0059,2.9851,4.7701,0.6243,2.426,5.4572,3.7214,1.7246,3.6245,0.5044,3.0495,1.6661,4.6837,2.4155,2.796,5.4638,0.7831,0.9775,5.9931,0.0378,1.7432,2.5673,3.6199,4.3816,2.478,6.6239,0.3919,0.0225,0.1492,5.3719,4.9083,0.0934,1.0698,2.9711,0.266]}

The announcement came as the White House scrambled to make last-minute changes to its healthcare proposal for Congress and promised to take a closer look at Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. A White House official said the administration wasn\u2019t yet ready to sign off on Trump\u2019s proposal at this early stage, saying that a significant change was needed to make it work. Trump\u2019s proposal would put individual mandate aside and scrap the subsidies by the end of the year. It also would eliminate the individual mandate entirely and focus solely on states that chose to enforce the law. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said lawmakers will try to bring together a compromise, but said he wasn\u2019t \u201cat all confident that one will come.\u201d \u201cWe need to get through the next couple of months and get something done,\u201d Ryan added.","token_len":225,"entropy":[7.1725,0.0797,0.0303,0.0499,2.592,3.5529,1.6653,8.0503,0.7175,2.7848,0.717,1.2837,7.6547,0.004,5.2711,4.0802,5.8583,0.7247,3.1534,4.286,0.9388,6.0436,2.8027,0.7097,2.366,2.4712,1.7991,10.2151,1.2682,0.0058,6.9846,0.0075,3.0977,3.2653,2.9584,3.722,3.4248,6.8063,2.0397,0.5006,2.5434,2.2805,0.0217,5.6705,2.5469,1.0241,3.4232,0.5729,3.7232,5.9473,1.1342,1.7583,1.855,2.3536,0.0006,6.1085,0.06,4.1515,6.9098,0.478,0.1223,0.7765,0.184,2.1823,2.7763,4.4125,4.1963,4.9229,2.7864,6.8958,0.7553,3.7785,2.214,3.4811,0.008,0.2031,4.82,16.6672,7.73,5.4869,5.0777,0.5503,0.9813,4.8544,2.6263,0.0011,0.6091,0.5286,1.1244,1.8969,6.1511,7.8731,2.4612,0.0356,3.5628,1.0612,0.0751,4.4962,0.7792,0.0184,5.8739,2.86,0.0152,0.0167,2.0864,5.2785,1.1877,3.7915,0.2547,1.434,4.8622,2.016,3.7997,6.5009,4.5515,1.4849,1.6152,1.1689,2.3971,1.3816,1.569,0.5433,3.9228,2.3521,0.0097,0.0186,1.4123,1.4261,5.4433,4.1693,1.8882,6.6386,1.9568,6.9944,1.0904,2.8576,4.5688,3.0749,0.1983,0.0014,1.3313,0.535,0.6942,3.7962,2.1404,0.4554,3.5,1.1301,2.5012,0.1119,3.2565,1.885,5.6663,4.9412,0.0041,4.12,1.3588,4.859,0.532,5.8983,1.333,0.4927,0.5212,5.4981,2.1501,0.0026,0.0365,2.0011,0.4726,0.0048,0.0185,0.0133,0.0034,0.9517,6.39,2.8996,4.666,0.1149,5.1017,3.2561,2.3317,5.5511,3.8411,0.8307,2.6449,1.5751,2.6238,0.0812,0.0944,0.0002,12.2894,9.0008,4.1138,3.4143,2.6045,1.0175,6.4483,3.8426,2.2814,2.5864,3.7754,9.6512,5.1357,1.2847,6.4563,3.4922,0.47,2.1404,4.0336,1.9017,3.6365,3.3757,0.3589,1.7556,1.6222,2.0621,3.9789,0.576,2.1257,4.1703,2.9284,5.0241,3.4162,0.2765]}

The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics approved Thursday the creation of an ethics training program for its members. The Ethics and Civility Project will be implemented in collaboration with an outside educational consultant that will also be tasked with training committee staff on ethics best practices. The Ethics and Civility Project, which does not include any changes to the current ethics code of conduct, was approved by the committee's ethics panel in light of the growing number of complaints against lawmakers, and the recent scandal at the House Democratic Caucus. The committee did not provide details on the length of the program, nor on how the staff training will occur. The Ethics and Campaign Finance Act of 1996 requires members to complete specific ethics training, both at the start of their term and thereafter, as well as receive annual refreshers on the ethics code. The most common complaint lodged against a member is in regard to a sexual encounter or affair, but complaints range from inappropriate use of office resources to personal use of campaign funds.","token_len":230,"entropy":[8.0531,4.3539,5.5961,9.8838,3.2921,2.8831,8.1094,2.6776,6.1336,0.3738,0.0095,0.0362,8.8115,0.9495,9.7309,1.2805,0.2327,0.3355,1.9816,3.5184,3.1011,1.4147,3.9815,0.3289,3.5318,9.5276,3.7269,1.4026,5.1127,2.0702,0.214,2.9134,3.8933,0.0034,0.0059,0.0029,3.0193,1.1862,0.0036,6.5164,0.0265,4.9639,4.7076,6.5406,2.2699,4.6354,0.0208,2.1758,3.5267,6.5804,0.7972,1.1942,3.885,0.8108,1.1085,1.9893,5.5917,2.7975,13.4487,0.4944,5.1533,3.302,2.3286,6.0204,1.4203,5.9165,0.0056,5.2713,2.9029,7.0721,5.2754,3.8643,0.8723,4.7016,2.5045,2.5923,0.0366,4.4115,6.0191,1.5739,1.53,2.8619,9.9612,0.0389,0.6816,1.7467,3.4397,0.2876,0.0353,0.0005,0.1143,3.1472,0.9623,6.4357,0.0477,2.3787,2.7528,7.7247,0.4177,1.2192,2.5426,2.122,1.5202,5.1632,0.2089,0.1592,2.8498,3.1,0.495,0.4498,2.9446,2.3544,2.3743,2.8557,2.0913,8.0025,0.0015,1.2884,4.261,2.1143,0.0094,3.1564,3.2112,1.8663,2.8042,2.8442,1.1446,3.7607,4.3581,2.3826,0.3849,2.4808,5.1589,1.2567,0.8106,1.6599,1.4533,4.4908,0.0919,4.1395,1.8071,1.0571,0.8159,7.7658,0.0888,0.4306,1.4208,0.8176,3.4986,3.5945,1.5687,1.9869,4.4016,3.9663,0.8441,5.1177,0.4792,1.6057,1.7539,0.1071,10.6157,1.039,4.2335,1.3411,4.642,2.2943,3.5705,0.8579,4.1447,6.7067,2.2795,0.2752,2.6053,6.4062,3.1369,0.768,5.2864,0.6907,1.1115,2.3421,0.3069,5.3126,1.3041,2.9167,1.2311,0.0218,6.0616,4.7746,5.3897,2.4303,2.4897,1.9945,2.0773,2.7537,1.103,1.2156,6.4602,3.467,2.5063,6.3636,0.8925,1.861,1.2712,1.0386,5.8302,3.3113,0.003,2.5409,4.763,3.6656,2.6065,7.1352,1.5155,2.1253,4.6073,6.2567,0.218,4.7145,3.949,0.0373,7.0328,3.1021,0.9179,5.392,4.8562,0.6329,4.1248,0.3889,0.4194]}

He urged North and South Korea to work with the international community to maintain pressure on North Korea.","token_len":231,"entropy":[9.1658,4.9475,5.2584,0.1029,8.4983,7.5049,4.2847,6.6322,0.6084,2.1172,2.2639,3.4508,1.5121,1.2925,4.7323,1.5924,6.775,1.4633,0.0116,0.0106,0.3995,1.7866,2.3324,1.8551,4.2979,4.4863,0.0023,2.5966,0.0203,0.5391,0.4696,0.0045,4.2535,0.0009,0.0,0.0001,2.0776,1.838,2.0473,2.3897,0.3717,1.5838,8.2233,0.8257,4.1375,0.8193,0.3355,25.2861,2.0382,4.7817,0.4942,3.1298,1.3476,2.057,0.0004,1.1208,0.0845,0.903,1.0041,0.0103,1.4223,5.9504,0.4387,1.5173,3.0702,0.8233,3.0087,4.9123,1.1789,3.3637,2.3221,4.3649,7.1126,4.3318,4.5466,0.2561,7.3511,1.9981,1.2216,0.3987,0.802,7.1308,0.016,1.142,14.6309,8.4485,3.1594,1.4652,1.3623,1.5736,2.5288,0.0012,0.0601,6.5916,1.5307,2.5912,1.8778,3.909,2.2627,3.5846,6.991,1.41,3.0284,0.0009,2.9672,1.9313,4.4458,3.4759,3.5395,6.0583,1.6526,4.7389,1.786,5.0973,1.4592,5.5203,0.0536,1.5681,0.6374,0.0005,0.3977,0.8535,1.3961,1.3001,7.1356,2.3477,2.0634,0.0011,0.312,1.2513,2.0428,4.0295,1.7709,4.6592,4.1231,4.4473,4.8377,1.0982,3.1247,1.5149,2.3023,2.8432,3.7873,0.0079,2.7124,0.916,7.7747,0.272,0.7339,0.2996,8.6466,0.0005,2.8565,0.0005,0.0006,2.4323,2.15,2.4394,1.8573,0.0007,0.3388,3.5644,1.086,0.0005,1.4462,6.13,7.1683,2.3997,5.1406,2.3297,5.6687,0.5544,0.0358,11.0175,0.5401,0.0004,0.94,0.5574,3.9358,0.4123,2.809,3.1737,5.532,7.7205,0.0388,0.8957,1.9174,0.4,3.8598,1.6941,5.4182,3.2381,3.8254,3.8043,1.6935,0.8438,2.0101,0.4833,2.161,1.9324,3.6312,1.1101,2.0503,3.4444,5.8425,0.208,4.6359,1.1956,1.7124,1.6383,0.7215,3.4298,3.7025,2.7951,4.1412,0.0042,1.0461,0.1265,2.2116,3.0667,1.4305,3.8052,0.0056,0.3548,6.0755,3.5116,0.1638,1.9925,0.2375,1.8118]}

EU troops, deployed in Mali in response to the ousting of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in a coup last month, would need to win over the region's population in order to prevent the rise in violence in Mali and West Africa.\nThe European Union is considering sending around 3,500 troops to Mali to help restore peace and security in the country, three diplomats familiar with the plan said Thursday, following the departure of French troops who have been tasked with overseeing an ongoing military operation there. Several foreign ministers at the European Union (EU) summit in Luxembourg on Wednesday rejected the French proposal to send the military, saying it would hinder European cooperation with Mali\u2019s president. Speaking at the opening of the EU summit, Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said \u201cEuropean security is not solely based on military power,\u201d referring to the threat posed by Islamic State (IS) militants.","token_len":231,"entropy":[9.6212,3.3359,4.867,9.1467,0.8973,4.8378,2.847,5.245,5.9533,3.713,1.3506,7.233,5.8039,2.2672,5.3695,6.7055,5.6868,3.1115,4.9195,0.0153,4.3044,4.3186,8.5932,1.3892,2.6227,3.2013,4.7057,5.9077,7.7326,3.1098,2.0962,1.1832,2.6509,2.7712,2.3028,1.7714,6.0724,0.0017,0.5295,3.2524,0.5276,5.5114,1.6202,3.2528,1.9315,1.196,1.8562,0.1332,8.022,4.7462,3.6553,5.6107,1.2483,0.9663,2.3238,4.1246,0.0017,1.263,4.3549,1.3691,0.0233,1.7569,6.0474,0.9094,0.2494,0.0114,0.0015,0.0426,0.3138,1.5425,3.915,1.6144,2.087,1.884,0.0506,3.8469,3.7813,0.3695,3.7621,1.6678,2.4175,4.6828,0.1201,4.0202,2.7203,1.3803,0.0487,4.1803,1.6916,5.0725,5.6549,1.4931,2.7977,3.9984,2.0968,5.8951,0.1685,0.5529,0.8596,14.0919,3.3364,0.2641,2.3481,4.885,3.437,6.1408,3.8447,0.0402,1.6857,0.7535,0.4523,0.3599,1.3225,1.8507,4.8293,2.2833,0.9224,1.6065,1.0466,0.4389,1.1479,1.0321,7.288,4.6749,2.3834,0.0016,0.142,2.1152,0.6008,3.5919,1.8614,4.9203,1.8907,4.0792,0.0541,1.9322,3.5453,5.1732,2.0659,0.944,4.7818,0.2434,5.176,3.8578,3.4126,2.4607,1.5372,3.5903,0.3006,7.0244,4.7725,0.9364,5.4125,0.4837,2.8494,1.1066,7.5185,0.0815,0.04,0.4596,0.9884,3.0364,1.3435,1.6915,4.6121,0.9333,4.8572,1.252,1.6373,0.3299,3.1708,4.0778,2.078,0.6739,0.8575,1.0443,5.2043,4.7238,4.6499,1.5165,0.8861,17.2626,7.2142,5.8514,4.9132,0.8318,6.6227,1.5827,0.8696,4.1073,0.4615,0.4758,2.6806,0.7719,0.9875,8.6276,1.0196,0.0236,10.4319,0.0173,10.1236,8.2508,0.619,14.6545,5.7437,5.5488,2.5499,1.4786,2.7189,6.3445,4.1516,0.0678,3.7586,2.7193,1.5104,5.0031,8.0409,6.8508,0.0597,0.9717,3.9635,0.6013,0.0512,2.3545,0.524,1.9807,0.1609,0.7359,1.0391,1.093]}

The proposals are expected to be formally launched as part of a package of measures set to boost the EU\u2019s economy. They include a proposal to establish a legal base for a permanent form of monetary union, or common currency, at the next EU summit in December. At that time, the issue can be put to the people on a referendum. \u201cWe need a common currency at the end of 2014,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday after a closed-door meeting with the European Council president, Donald Tusk. \u201cBut only if the European people accept it,\u201d she said. The central bank is expected to be fully integrated into a European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), a system that was put in place in 1999 after the end of the Cold War and has seen the euro make its way through a series of crises. One of the proposals in the package includes an amendment to the Treaty on European Union, called Article 135.","token_len":235,"entropy":[8.1703,1.7011,6.9783,3.2879,2.3807,11.1012,1.1143,9.6033,7.7559,1.692,0.9784,3.1615,3.1954,1.5756,0.0195,3.4833,8.3278,0.6529,9.0178,1.6467,0.9374,1.9236,3.4869,8.6465,0.2507,0.847,6.0443,2.9467,4.7922,0.7688,3.6579,2.1401,5.4408,4.7133,0.4597,1.1055,0.3135,0.4551,0.5783,3.4041,2.4288,2.0412,2.5751,0.0586,0.6152,4.0101,4.9342,5.0877,1.482,0.0005,1.1449,5.0211,0.2323,2.615,4.7765,0.9032,7.4429,1.569,2.0235,15.3446,7.1908,5.4469,3.3095,2.0187,4.6706,1.3222,1.5432,3.1764,0.5382,4.3007,0.6319,6.3607,5.5215,0.4121,4.5737,5.0913,8.2845,0.0031,4.7699,0.0469,1.2766,4.724,4.4338,0.9649,0.3517,4.3384,0.5104,4.7981,1.5139,0.3713,0.4818,3.2402,0.5363,5.7067,2.5287,1.8047,0.2187,1.0382,6.0472,5.5989,0.71,4.763,0.2747,1.4872,4.3352,4.0859,1.5639,2.1559,1.7033,6.6982,4.2789,8.3862,2.2666,1.6153,2.4611,0.6935,5.2958,0.6211,2.7976,0.1354,4.3478,2.0972,6.6801,10.1162,8.0576,0.5113,0.0304,0.0002,1.0612,1.538,1.073,3.9948,1.7751,5.6796,0.1657,0.0013,0.5302,0.8202,2.5553,1.4143,2.183,2.6205,1.2787,0.6704,0.001,0.0001,0.758,2.97,0.1099,3.0088,6.3021,1.8035,1.0862,2.8332,5.2701,4.5342,2.6607,1.8691,1.6265,1.6681,1.4176,0.6219,0.5453,2.1015,5.6758,2.0505,2.6992,1.8638,0.0219,4.6006,4.9981,7.2928,0.8554,4.6536,3.1549,6.0101,2.9867,0.2383,0.1452,2.0159,6.2849,0.0024,1.2839,2.3072,3.8154,1.1735,3.8816,3.9999,0.8072,0.0113,1.1065,3.4166,2.4629,0.7894,3.3068,0.0012,0.5908,0.348,0.0013,3.1003,1.8533,3.2085,1.7332,2.9147,7.6918,2.8184,1.889,2.5214,2.7334,0.9555,0.0003,1.5193,0.7605,5.8934,0.6002,0.2146,3.6363,4.689,0.2473,4.8439,3.1195,2.6078,5.7228,0.2522,0.4373,4.1935,0.4102,1.5927,0.0093,2.7326,6.0868,3.1898,9.1617,2.1045]}

The North African oil producer has been in the doldrums since its 2011 uprising against Gadaffi fell short of its goals. Libya s opposition is now divided and the ruling government of GNA has yet to deliver on promises. It is struggling to deal with a series of recent oil field sabotages blamed on rebels. Hundreds of rebels and government supporters have been wounded and an estimated 20,000 civilians displaced by fighting. After Libya s revolution that ousted Muammar Gadaffi in 2011, oil workers began exploiting deposits that they had been denied for decades. The rebels say they want to make the region in between the capital, Cairo, and the Gulf the center of the country. Mr. Misrati was one of their biggest opponents. He oversaw Misrata s development and a drive to revive the local economy after the 2011 upheaval, attracting investments from Middle Eastern and African businessmen. The Libyan authorities seized power in Misrata in July 2014, taking back its economic power and imposing a strict state lockdown.","token_len":237,"entropy":[8.2947,13.2239,0.3161,4.3026,6.2266,0.9513,10.0939,11.6532,8.1589,1.4488,1.7859,0.045,1.1782,6.3703,0.0228,0.006,0.7355,5.5728,1.1157,1.7715,1.2462,10.583,0.1861,2.8123,2.6097,7.6352,1.389,1.7812,3.1489,5.1512,1.6889,0.1745,0.1661,2.4938,8.5452,0.1276,6.7485,2.8918,2.405,1.1882,3.1193,1.5706,10.442,0.2759,0.0009,1.32,2.7553,3.8122,3.0858,1.2227,5.336,2.1322,0.0008,6.0046,1.8391,0.3294,1.4265,3.2105,0.9588,2.9259,9.5113,4.9493,3.641,3.421,4.5916,3.393,2.2357,6.0635,3.2117,3.5866,6.5894,4.1181,2.0826,4.7878,0.0009,4.6712,1.3429,3.6473,3.4634,4.309,1.658,5.4377,0.268,4.4373,0.0119,1.6903,3.9322,0.0003,4.6703,6.2981,6.6875,11.3926,0.1872,6.4477,0.0669,3.1933,1.319,6.799,0.2406,4.2972,2.4299,2.9519,3.3979,0.6246,0.7404,5.3058,2.0546,5.6481,0.857,3.2094,0.199,0.0035,2.6074,4.5547,2.0176,2.1913,0.8468,6.6148,4.5669,1.0885,3.904,5.9364,2.8269,2.7437,0.0051,0.0043,3.0064,0.1495,0.0005,1.306,0.3911,0.2402,4.5227,5.437,3.473,6.3929,10.1635,3.5118,3.2105,1.6368,2.9071,3.3931,3.6399,0.788,0.5401,2.0657,5.2682,3.4759,0.6985,3.2829,0.4392,4.188,2.2556,3.7704,5.9768,8.1459,2.1264,4.2144,2.581,7.2249,0.7623,0.0764,1.206,5.9376,7.6533,2.959,0.0455,1.3671,2.4613,0.9208,5.6522,0.5964,6.5451,0.0443,10.9569,2.9687,3.74,0.0309,5.7206,3.2178,4.098,0.8197,1.7647,6.5769,7.2028,0.0102,0.0062,1.9199,6.1613,1.4532,4.8913,5.5379,0.5153,5.1911,1.2707,4.8798,0.3328,3.6122,1.328,1.6941,6.6865,2.1153,7.2775,5.2672,0.8693,6.4235,0.518,1.6262,1.2334,5.1044,0.7685,2.6599,3.5385,3.4735,5.6019,1.7381,0.5973,7.4126,0.0024,0.0016,1.3464,2.9168,3.6953,1.3427,4.5151,3.5876,3.9303,5.3685,2.682,0.9552,4.0927,1.4581,4.0552,3.4898,11.4401,0.8844]}

This week a court convicted six Australians of plotting a deadly attack against tourists in Bali that was foiled. On Wednesday five of them served life sentences for that plot. And the Australian parliament says it will have tough enough laws to deal with terrorism in the event of next week s attacks in Paris. The U.N. Human Rights Council also said on Saturday its investigations into torture in the Syrian crisis should focus on those responsible. At least 19 people have been killed in the violence in Iraq over the weekend. Several hundred civilians have been displaced in the country's capital after Kurdish rebels captured most of the area around the Iraqi parliament building. In Ukraine an unidentified man on Saturday shot to death a Russian-born Ukrainian police officer in the eastern region of Donetsk. More than 20 other people have also died this year during the separatist insurgency in western Ukraine.","token_len":242,"entropy":[7.6432,9.3313,12.4577,2.5821,6.5843,7.3689,0.1297,0.1057,3.5631,2.8507,5.074,1.2015,2.0797,1.0151,1.2136,4.0207,4.3388,9.4408,0.7303,1.0113,2.8613,3.7298,0.9507,8.983,6.05,0.0485,4.723,3.2027,6.2554,4.4311,4.0969,0.1612,6.3434,0.4941,0.3355,10.5149,2.5852,4.8094,2.0257,3.3495,4.033,5.1219,1.5477,1.1903,2.5229,3.1401,3.0013,3.0655,3.5907,0.0807,2.368,3.0977,1.4254,0.8941,4.1412,2.5226,2.4641,6.1118,1.053,8.0409,2.497,10.8552,9.4465,3.4813,2.3077,0.7945,1.5455,5.7505,2.0602,3.4199,2.4704,1.6731,6.2759,4.4087,3.5032,4.6702,4.7906,5.2064,4.5617,0.3565,1.9919,2.6248,2.9174,0.9969,2.7017,4.477,1.1902,5.9727,0.3169,4.145,3.3223,3.5767,0.0003,3.882,4.606,3.4235,6.3424,2.08,1.8506,7.1719,2.6075,0.3147,1.8035,6.0357,2.2861,0.4543,5.5962,3.0777,4.0474,3.5742,5.3691,0.5437,0.7429,5.1393,6.5709,6.1108,2.4093,0.959,3.0283,0.0142,2.5533,2.0094,1.2551,6.0999,0.1978,8.2318,1.5096,9.7734,6.4244,1.9099,1.9455,1.2244,2.0545,5.9888,0.043,1.881,0.2374,3.8446,0.0057,0.1326,4.4168,1.8885,1.3685,1.1596,4.0846,6.5645,0.4885,6.7206,2.2896,2.177,4.5558,5.4693,2.7246,3.4485,0.1251,3.4289,1.4795,1.4364,5.4107,0.548,4.7879,0.6423,0.6748,0.3345,0.49,0.7679,1.492,3.3327,1.2069,3.6819,3.9837,0.1041,4.3879,0.9337,6.2799,2.4038,5.6615,0.6355,0.2274,3.4732,2.1556,1.2194,1.8735,1.9759,4.8998,5.399,4.888,2.9135,4.5369,4.7428,0.0594,0.7616,4.6204,3.6895,0.6505,4.368,5.3881,1.0523,0.8735,3.6153,7.832,5.0764,5.1854,1.755,5.366,1.1104,2.6881,5.181,0.0033,1.1435,3.2579,3.5909,2.7978,2.254,5.1343,0.1017,1.8151,1.1547,2.3028,5.0289,0.1212,0.5543,0.7271,4.9744,0.0901,3.0693,3.5471,0.5133,0.8479,2.7513,2.8862,5.2715,1.1128,4.4757,1.6038,3.8967,1.9671,0.5144,5.6648,0.0325,0.5297]}

It is not clear how many tourists are visiting the North on a monthly basis, but according to the officials, they expect about 100 visitors over the next three months.\nNorth Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile tests have infuriated the West, and the Trump administration has said it will continue to pressure the North with increased sanctions over its missile and nuclear programme. According to Foreign Policy, after Trump left office the US still plans to deploy about 30,000 troops in South Korea, with the idea that most of them would remain there until 2024. In addition to this the USA will maintain a naval base in Japan\u2019s uninhabited islands of Okinawa.","token_len":244,"entropy":[10.0389,2.6601,4.6682,4.5878,6.7532,4.5885,2.7339,10.9931,7.9908,3.1111,0.7113,3.459,0.3294,0.0005,1.2712,8.6699,5.3051,1.9824,2.0685,5.6441,2.6518,5.0918,9.3316,1.6994,0.0002,4.5086,1.3766,5.4,6.2448,5.549,0.0153,6.6456,0.0411,0.4159,0.1443,0.2974,0.211,0.0043,8.629,1.3066,1.9643,0.5071,2.7261,4.0761,7.9911,2.3959,0.1454,5.4613,1.3716,1.5134,4.0882,3.1365,3.1308,3.253,1.279,0.0066,6.0655,5.2156,2.3718,0.003,0.0028,1.3287,6.9382,0.6049,2.8124,6.1413,4.494,6.3868,6.1765,6.037,0.567,0.5349,0.9317,1.2368,1.4738,3.8148,0.0059,7.0646,3.5458,3.5939,1.5678,4.1709,0.0081,3.5267,3.1386,4.0367,4.6129,3.6467,7.4163,5.6021,1.4426,8.0714,2.0128,7.3683,0.5505,3.9782,1.4069,2.7305,4.4112,2.991,4.3295,0.0448,0.8647,4.1227,1.4232,2.9914,3.0929,2.3493,1.9178,5.0722,5.1479,0.766,4.8097,0.6889,1.5396,0.5665,1.3567,1.0424,2.133,2.082,4.1044,1.507,1.0819,4.1692,2.7025,3.8304,0.0564,1.2496,1.2067,4.7035,0.0022,1.883,4.9984,0.4368,2.8487,3.3479,2.5064,2.4775,3.9991,4.6908,0.278,0.3212,2.0989,0.557,0.3985,1.3455,14.301,0.4247,8.1721,6.5333,1.8877,1.7137,0.1649,0.3875,2.4837,5.6649,0.0027,1.9093,1.2569,0.9285,2.3194,2.3996,4.2603,0.2615,0.6142,2.7025,0.7308,1.1193,3.8783,0.5061,3.0654,1.5636,1.269,3.7452,5.7683,1.1401,4.0616,0.2176,3.0723,0.5691,0.1487,4.0061,0.2372,6.0687,0.0015,5.3332,0.3153,0.7229,5.4207,1.7759,5.5631,0.3892,3.95,2.7711,5.4918,4.3297,0.0678,4.6094,4.0475,3.7359,1.1056,0.0026,0.8967,1.7372,1.0063,0.0264,1.5074,3.4602,1.7579,5.3089,2.4847,5.3256,0.3688,1.2822,1.3742,3.9995,2.4369,1.367,7.095,0.3013,3.7898,2.7976,1.1952,4.4489,4.5422,7.464,2.2392,4.5376,1.4782,3.7565,0.7824,0.4562,3.0443,15.5621,7.2593,6.2867,6.9757,0.0009,0.0236,2.4931,3.9437,1.9672,3.3702]}

The alert was the result of a routine security check at the tube station, which normally conducts searches of luggage at the entrances. A member of staff at the station was suspicious and reported it to police.","token_len":246,"entropy":[7.7268,2.7729,5.0741,8.0415,3.8069,1.7067,8.6983,1.5717,4.9251,1.7245,2.95,1.3503,8.1319,0.2141,0.8099,2.91,1.5334,3.2418,2.1554,2.2311,0.8743,7.6714,0.0608,4.398,0.003,2.8882,4.5078,4.1677,2.7458,5.8648,7.945,2.8065,12.2526,9.217,2.2345,4.6927,1.7813,0.028,0.2297,0.2024,20.782,0.9233,2.6202,4.4017,3.7894,1.644,0.052,0.2677,2.2856,0.2414,7.2442,1.5462,1.6417,2.9845,5.2508,1.3696,1.4162,2.0712,5.2056,3.1064,0.5763,2.4678,5.8051,2.3362,0.3985,1.792,2.7204,1.4248,6.6168,1.6462,2.4298,2.5113,8.3818,0.1642,1.309,0.4923,0.3222,5.5689,7.1864,4.3133,1.6457,5.1046,6.2944,4.4015,0.5389,2.7488,6.048,1.309,6.3763,0.5047,4.45,5.3191,1.4951,1.4293,5.8086,1.5051,7.3268,5.3723,3.2035,0.0037,0.3543,0.0008,3.1597,5.9263,3.9437,0.0119,0.5987,4.5403,0.4313,1.0372,5.8744,2.3881,7.6406,0.0064,0.627,7.1153,7.3577,2.2381,1.5676,1.0837,8.0775,4.1758,3.99,3.666,2.9993,0.7506,6.5522,0.0942,0.6979,2.4742,1.9656,0.9732,0.017,1.8194,2.5964,1.702,4.2985,6.0014,1.5132,4.8381,0.0914,3.3729,3.11,3.7036,2.5014,2.8139,2.4273,3.2421,8.0734,3.3738,0.7429,0.4712,4.1953,3.3845,1.299,7.5747,0.1851,4.2331,2.0659,2.5663,0.3596,0.8653,2.0548,1.8083,6.8381,4.1531,6.7932,4.3015,4.447,3.4104,2.1057,1.5568,0.0289,5.4887,2.1185,4.5656,1.4386,3.8347,5.2976,4.5367,0.6112,0.9832,6.844,0.0027,2.1974,2.8981,0.6423,5.0835,8.724,6.1784,3.2991,3.2411,0.3034,4.1572,0.8813,2.8583,0.7265,1.4221,1.0179,0.6938,5.7929,5.3197,8.1488,1.0557,0.7983,1.965,3.7265,0.9801,4.8624,2.7235,0.0061,0.7662,4.9158,1.9017,0.5502,2.1621,0.927,6.3295,0.411,1.8581,1.5132,5.8908,5.2641,5.1759,1.8345,6.0094,3.1442,1.3119,3.9636,2.6282,3.7061,5.7527,0.0205,2.4415,1.658,0.3675,0.657,2.5155,7.2799,2.341,4.5374,1.8315,0.2222,1.0218,0.6986]}

The satellites had originally been planned to fly by November and have not yet arrived on their appointed orbits. The satellites were to be used by the Russian navy and the military intelligence agency to spy on ships of the U.S. and other foreign powers. The Roscosmos director general Sergei Ryazanskiy ordered an investigation into the failure. \"There is nothing more important than to ensure that all launches in the future are not repeatable.\" The failure to send the satellites to the desired orbits came as Russians celebrated victory in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. They had hoped to fly some of the satellites to orbit around Russia, but that effort was also thwarted.","token_len":248,"entropy":[9.7862,0.8556,0.0039,3.5149,0.0994,0.0004,0.0015,1.4273,1.2507,2.3655,2.7305,8.3877,5.8233,0.2028,1.3869,7.8883,1.2355,2.5936,2.2511,1.3421,10.5512,0.257,5.2008,7.4212,9.6838,0.823,5.8529,1.2698,0.3871,3.9968,5.905,1.3911,1.6628,3.7558,0.0994,3.4229,7.7322,9.289,0.4235,0.6509,5.7421,3.713,0.5991,0.4401,0.0157,0.0001,1.1859,3.082,1.1568,2.6604,1.2785,1.9888,0.0879,1.7656,1.3213,0.4612,0.8647,2.4934,2.2713,1.9236,5.1688,1.507,2.1477,3.2126,6.2405,0.0715,3.5384,2.036,3.0157,4.5917,3.3671,0.7364,1.0956,5.4769,0.886,4.6394,1.3339,2.9405,2.403,1.329,1.2647,2.1322,4.5623,0.0095,2.0092,4.8162,2.4346,4.796,4.9037,4.2544,2.1727,8.948,4.764,3.5071,1.5628,2.0171,0.5401,2.8247,0.6682,0.0052,0.0014,1.3655,2.7595,1.279,2.7425,0.0037,0.9701,0.0217,0.0002,2.4399,3.7821,6.0107,3.3926,2.3527,0.3906,2.2319,6.0587,3.7303,6.1113,0.2424,2.2201,0.6706,2.568,2.0454,4.9078,3.501,3.402,3.8157,1.1619,2.9248,3.1158,2.7941,9.0605,3.8196,0.4975,1.8021,4.1719,1.2564,2.2074,1.1338,3.0405,2.2887,1.3837,1.4416,5.9534,1.9707,2.2018,3.2313,5.4065,2.1752,2.6565,4.958,0.1157,7.1327,4.6951,0.663,3.9357,0.0073,0.0159,0.4446,1.9439,1.8874,3.735,2.064,0.8211,1.5686,4.2329,0.0061,0.0007,5.4319,1.9297,4.3843,2.6678,4.6019,0.9244,0.0104,6.3712,3.0956,0.6566,0.4135,0.1909,2.369,1.338,2.1182,3.3903,0.9052,2.6993,2.9768,3.072,0.5274,2.3801,3.0101,0.5828,2.7973,5.3975,3.7814,1.183,2.2455,0.8356,4.2331,6.2541,0.2914,4.7804,1.8174,2.5163,3.0461,4.6288,0.7568,0.6618,1.4966,1.6593,5.2617,0.6945,3.4968,1.3884,7.1378,4.5442,7.1359,1.531,0.7799,3.7053,1.0211,0.113,0.6605,0.1588,0.8926,4.4656,2.7435,2.727,0.6144,3.6247,6.0047,1.2233,0.2093,1.1832,1.4575,3.6906,2.6794,2.1484,2.1993,0.7187,3.8715,4.0457,0.9623,5.884,3.1429,2.9951]}

As he gathered supporters outside an election office, Nasralla accused the electoral tribunal of manipulating the vote-count to ensure Hernandez's narrow victory in a vote tainted by widespread irregularities.\nThe election, which was the latest in an unbroken line of polls that have unravelled from being unquestionably free and fair to having an almost unrecognizable outcome, caused international concern. The US, which has urged its citizens in Honduras to back the national unity government, refused to send observers to supervise the voting.\nThe US State Department warned that it would consider Honduras a \"non-friendlier country,\" meaning that it would not grant visa to US citizens holding Honduran passports.\nThis is the second round of vote counting that the Honduran Election Commission has called. The last round was contested and violent, with opposition supporters rioting in streets. Hernandez's campaign said the tribunal had refused to accept its complaint about the election but the Honduran opposition says that was not the case.\nProtesters demanded that election officials reconvene and conduct a new election.","token_len":254,"entropy":[6.3407,4.0169,8.7989,0.3947,4.7822,1.2015,2.952,6.8776,0.0032,4.5777,3.4392,4.827,7.7332,5.0538,4.9552,2.917,2.0635,1.8134,0.2975,3.2441,2.8986,2.4243,0.4724,2.6446,4.7187,0.0007,0.59,5.7448,2.1296,2.0783,1.0561,7.3007,1.1451,6.0972,7.5158,3.3686,1.5149,5.0638,3.8633,1.7801,7.2707,2.4203,7.8851,2.4731,3.2052,4.8121,1.5413,2.4193,1.5263,1.6662,0.0015,0.0016,3.8856,0.9045,3.7297,0.8274,0.2162,5.4894,0.621,2.0617,5.7236,0.1595,2.5373,3.6473,3.7241,1.612,5.6031,0.3429,2.5811,1.8984,3.7087,8.3382,0.2688,5.3619,3.3304,0.3853,0.8455,14.7993,3.4499,3.1631,0.7957,1.9184,4.875,4.4294,0.9864,3.6423,6.0591,1.6537,4.3807,0.0829,5.816,1.9487,1.3552,9.441,1.2739,0.0041,5.3559,7.7402,12.6244,0.1036,7.24,3.3955,0.2415,0.9584,8.0639,4.1643,4.2893,6.1226,1.0284,4.2578,0.4191,7.3116,5.3461,2.4779,1.9198,2.3489,5.2463,2.3094,1.4084,1.2286,5.2482,2.5727,3.6284,4.4358,0.3099,0.0928,4.2336,1.3601,6.2289,5.2652,0.0521,0.4504,6.3861,0.2168,5.3054,3.2811,0.7042,8.7599,0.0003,0.5835,3.8466,1.1881,0.4412,1.7259,3.2463,2.7797,0.0025,4.2548,1.0039,2.854,0.7806,4.1873,8.0793,1.408,0.8805,4.7738,0.0754,7.7757,4.1351,1.6091,2.8237,6.1342,1.4475,0.8394,0.5312,1.3768,5.9614,3.9866,3.711,3.9936,0.2586,6.6961,3.3702,0.0338,0.9193,0.757,0.816,6.3577,1.9906,1.6511,1.3165,4.2549,0.1354,4.7037,0.9766,1.9467,2.2642,1.1398,0.0209,6.6052,0.2962,0.7332,4.41,5.6376,1.5965,2.9839,1.2256,1.5597,7.149,5.8474,10.5242,2.5686,2.0998,5.7317,3.0217,6.5351,0.0134,1.4707,5.5165,1.871,6.5015,1.9326,2.8691,2.1767,1.6326,6.6345,1.8614,5.0985,0.11,3.2646,2.9229,7.0555,3.8308,0.9233,2.6188,5.6263,3.279,1.9198,0.0271,3.1594,5.0163,2.5607,2.9918,2.0733,0.4727,0.1062,0.1261,0.3889,6.7419,0.2555,6.067,0.9565,5.5961,0.5648,9.6142,0.2558,0.0001,2.6079,5.5231,1.0908,3.7118,1.3965,1.9437]}

At least five of the men died after being hung from a bridge near a popular tourist destination on Baja California's coast.

Ryan told The Associated Press that a summary of what Trump calls the Taxpayers\u2019 Bill of Rights to pass through Congress next week would look something like \u201cWe have a plan to increase the tax rate on corporate bonds a trillion dollars.\u201d\nWhat makes the plan unappealing to many House Republicans is the idea of further tax cuts for big companies and wealthy individuals while spending the money on infrastructure and expanding access to high-speed internet around the nation.\nBut Trump\u2019s decision to make tax cutting a top priority, given how Republican members of Congress have been divided on whether they ought to get involved in the 2018 midterm elections, does not bode well for a deal. The White House is pressuring Congress to act as quickly as possible but the Republicans seem intent on pushing the tax plan out to voters in time for the 2020 election.","token_len":258,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2193,0.3207,0.021,5.1166,1.0531,0.1905,2.594,2.2433,2.021,2.7755,2.3576,3.3307,3.6948,1.1777,0.0047,1.4117,6.4456,1.7396,8.3479,1.7212,0.7595,2.9819,2.547,5.8404,5.978,0.5113,1.7995,1.8059,2.1702,5.1832,3.2749,4.2388,0.2509,8.0484,1.364,4.0489,0.3974,4.6401,5.4017,0.9265,0.1179,21.7328,6.8005,3.7859,1.7452,5.9676,1.7246,2.5218,6.7875,1.1254,3.0073,0.1988,1.4688,5.2879,1.761,2.6497,3.94,0.8373,4.1964,0.0676,2.5907,1.4475,2.1584,0.1161,2.4801,2.6064,2.687,1.369,2.0486,2.5063,4.5999,0.5686,2.5047,1.4459,0.6561,0.0113,0.9538,0.4272,0.093,0.0538,4.0482,0.0146,0.831,5.4467,3.5647,3.2841,1.9681,0.0011,0.9162,3.6107,7.6152,0.0947,4.3576,1.6276,7.3178,1.7426,4.7631,9.9135,14.589,10.5688,4.027,0.3236,0.0171,4.7903,6.0784,3.4121,0.416,3.8174,0.3207,1.3268,5.5708,2.1237,0.0042,15.4818,6.7211,7.626,2.5326,1.5088,2.188,1.5122,4.9616,0.9496,2.6372,0.9109,1.352,4.2133,9.2177,6.8995,5.2324,0.0659,2.3892,2.1764,9.2303,2.0375,10.7248,5.1045,1.5035,1.8251,7.1172,4.6228,0.1506,0.8127,1.7054,5.3747,0.352,0.5205,1.8074,3.1897,1.5307,7.0138,3.2556,0.7468,0.414,4.9472,3.4491,2.1865,3.5736,0.7074,3.9189,7.0444,3.0958,1.636,0.5758,2.6986,1.3745,5.1676,5.0749,0.0617,4.0056,0.1256,0.9383,2.1206,8.2226,0.0159,3.3695,0.234,0.959,3.8067,2.8252,9.0632,2.6344,0.8242,6.1038,0.3799,3.7858,3.6586,6.7523,1.5611,1.3223,0.363,3.6028,4.5961,3.1734,5.9938,3.221,0.5742,0.171,0.7331,1.809,5.0425,1.4245,3.7682,3.1955,6.4478,0.0111,5.1125,2.5261,0.4862,1.4033,6.7277,1.108,0.0414,0.3801,4.1963,1.047,1.6828,0.0004,0.0154,0.0708,3.2552,3.1099,1.4073,3.2979,2.5924,0.0005,2.3154,6.9542,2.1245,0.2419,3.5115,3.8028,2.8691,0.0549,0.0311,5.6347,2.5783,4.9874,4.541,3.6535,0.0196,3.5972,2.3943,4.0933,1.7459,4.469,3.1362,2.9701,2.0284,4.9591,0.2972,0.7442,3.4369,1.8676,0.3979]}

So that if the world decides it is time for a change in leadership, we will be prepared.","token_len":260,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,6.2085,12.9938,8.3868,3.3149,5.106,10.1292,5.848,4.3854,1.4152,3.7376,6.737,3.9798,1.5309,1.0449,2.947,8.3624,0.0443,1.7704,7.6737,0.0025,1.4703,9.5311,1.2396,1.3285,7.1542,8.3897,0.4132,5.1169,3.5242,0.0003,0.0017,0.0594,3.0431,0.6475,2.5725,1.7653,1.2808,2.0041,1.2382,1.8027,2.7856,3.475,4.2236,3.1439,0.0007,0.1746,0.0086,3.5729,4.1175,3.6636,2.9043,0.0005,0.1293,0.0298,5.218,1.5438,7.2546,3.1496,2.4693,1.0064,2.6227,4.4772,5.8307,0.6314,5.7445,0.1152,0.0215,6.0388,3.1033,3.9179,0.8756,17.8074,3.1665,6.0427,0.285,1.7702,7.7316,3.2875,3.2447,0.7063,1.6467,6.3803,1.6538,3.6696,10.4076,8.2241,2.0081,4.4533,0.0441,5.0706,0.0042,1.6877,5.6245,1.7499,4.4813,0.3997,0.005,5.8793,1.169,3.9294,3.3126,5.5698,2.8858,7.707,5.3066,5.1835,0.1961,0.0001,0.4565,4.8785,1.6056,3.2667,0.6531,3.7342,7.9125,0.215,2.9439,2.9155,4.0095,3.1322,0.9919,1.8317,2.8473,2.586,3.9544,1.4784,0.8529,0.6666,2.9046,4.0839,3.8114,6.5047,2.0452,2.2594,1.8425,5.4911,0.665,1.5046,1.538,2.5462,0.4756,6.2328,2.8545,4.5993,2.6503,1.5113,0.3624,3.0307,0.0373,2.0442,4.7292,4.1643,3.3597,1.9707,8.3115,0.7918,2.2573,3.3105,1.2443,2.0457,6.1696,1.1564,2.4777,3.3941,0.6621,6.4048,0.7786,0.886,1.1212,5.6841,1.7567,4.282,1.0069,2.4678,1.4159,4.769,2.0511,3.5259,0.3486,2.064,3.3505,4.33,5.862,2.3889,2.2627,1.5465,2.913,0.1263,2.3609,3.4947,0.0295,0.5607,2.3812,3.1524,4.5164,3.2418,1.5354,3.4565,0.3544,4.041,0.3635,0.3063,3.9648,1.1893,1.6857,4.7059,2.1629,0.8193,1.8294,3.2965,4.4519,0.5648,1.842,1.6032,1.1119,0.9906,6.8975,2.7077,4.3099,4.0034,0.2065,1.3539,6.8053,1.0905,4.6685,1.6,0.7282,0.5956,6.8386,1.3259,3.6006,3.8369,0.363,1.6221,2.5264,0.3578,4.1936,3.1822,3.2046,3.7429,1.3119,3.9032,3.8893,1.5544,1.0314,1.2749,1.5112,1.11,2.3304,1.62,0.4733,1.5402,1.1045,3.0063,4.177,1.138]}

Taiwan dispatched five warships in response to the incident near the island s Eastern South China Sea coast, but the flight left unmarked and so far no one had reported witnessing it, the ministry said. It added : The plane, about 1,200 nautical miles from Taiwan, carried around 15 personnel, including two pilots. Defence Minister Alan Peter Cayetano said : Taiwan was able to identify the plane at a range of around 100 kilometres, and sent ships to monitor for further developments. A spokesman for the US air force identified the aircraft as a Long Range Transport aircraft, noting that it was likely a Chinese squadron taking part in air training exercises. The US military has long criticised Chinese aerial training exercises that it says do not respect international standards of transparency. The Chinese media reported that the aircraft flew south past the southern island of Baoshan in the South China Sea and that the military flew back to a bases after landing the plane around 1,200 nautical miles north of Taiwan.

{"prompt":"President Vladimir Putin confirmed Russia s worst kept political secret on Wednesday , saying he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip","text":"President Vladimir Putin confirmed Russia s worst kept political secret on Wednesday, saying he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip on power that he shares with President Vladimir Putin. The two men - both 59 - are regarded as the pillars of one of the world s most authoritarian states. Putin, the winner of the first free presidential elections in Russia in 1991 and long seen as an icon of free speech and Western-friendly liberalization, has built up a reputation of being distant to the public and unwilling to publicly comment. The government, he has repeatedly told his supporters, does not take on the role of a media proprietor. Putin has repeatedly shown little interest in the election process itself, and Russia is preparing for a second presidential election in March 2018. This time around, though, the opposition will be well organised, and the Kremlin s long-held view that elections are a purely constitutional issue has come unstuck. If Putin were to concede, it would signal perhaps the end for authoritarianism in Russia. He has hinted repeatedly in public that it is time to set an end to his rule, although his views on how to do so is almost completely opaque.

In a rare joint statement, Mr Gabriel and Turkey s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said their governments had agreed to improve ties. The two sides had agreed to set up an international commission next week to oversee the return of German citizens who have been kidnapped or detained in the Middle East. Germany was keen to persuade Turkey to allow its diplomatic missions throughout the Middle East to resume work after being closed to German diplomats, along with their colleagues in Turkey, for two months after diplomatic tensions rose following the detention of a German soldier by Kurdish rebels in Syria last October. Mr Gabriel and Mr Davutoglu spoke on the phone after they met earlier this week, Mr Davutoglu said. The Foreign Minister added that the two sides needed to discuss a few problems including the release of Turkish citizens arrested by the Syrian Kurdish PYD and the need to resume the work of diplomatic missions, as well as establishing a mechanism to oversee the return of the six German prisoners. There were no immediate details on the status of the six German nationals held by the Syrian Kurds.

However, the president's action comes at a critical point in his second term after the U.S. Senate Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved a massive spending bill to avert government shutdown and avoid default on foreign debt.\nPresident Obama asked Congress to approve funding for another two months so that the U.S. Treasury can avoid defaulting on foreign debt by the end of this week.\nHowever, Republican leaders in the Senate and House continue to dispute whether Obama's request would bring sufficient money into the system to reach that date.","token_len":264,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1615,1.9206,5.7465,7.8338,4.588,2.3962,7.274,1.5721,1.754,4.306,5.0617,8.0249,0.0288,3.6128,7.0223,4.3996,2.4749,2.8387,2.5218,0.5868,1.0148,3.1833,6.3736,7.3548,1.7155,3.0556,2.224,5.1966,0.1045,5.4557,2.3105,4.2425,0.4035,2.5939,3.9776,0.5132,0.3327,26.121,2.6204,1.3799,1.7208,4.984,3.3266,4.8248,2.061,4.5556,0.0049,6.2898,0.8594,6.5213,0.3506,0.4143,7.6643,0.4101,3.2284,0.3717,1.4679,2.0006,2.2216,2.1293,5.726,4.9909,4.1145,1.9668,4.4034,3.4487,1.4127,1.1958,0.0239,4.4531,5.5482,1.9393,0.018,6.3197,2.027,1.344,2.1191,0.6674,0.134,13.9794,3.4721,0.7435,0.0965,1.1877,2.2766,4.7106,2.5034,0.0847,4.6788,0.9469,5.1485,3.9448,2.2932,2.1432,6.4094,6.7228,3.1176,3.2266,2.4817,0.0007,12.6413,1.3645,0.4741,14.0805,0.5235,3.3778,2.5745,6.2286,1.1027,1.4071,2.6515,5.069,5.0924,0.1437,4.8097,4.7462,1.4958,3.848,3.0482,6.5753,2.1293,5.3708,0.0404,8.0033,0.7137,0.8987,1.5225,2.9208,6.1984,1.7454,0.2967,21.4502,1.629,0.7231,2.9554,2.0786,5.2687,3.7896,2.03,2.3104,3.7241,1.21,0.7567,6.0053,4.301,0.1662,1.1007,2.6136,1.1309,0.0268,0.2458,1.9117,6.1289,0.0274,1.7814,2.099,1.4837,5.0991,2.2225,2.0526,0.1142,1.8906,3.2471,0.9132,1.927,4.4036,0.4869,4.5962,2.4422,3.3728,0.0003,0.0011,0.0079,3.5079,6.3761,4.1911,0.5759,1.1063,1.4962,0.0051,2.9632,0.7206,5.293,1.0316,0.5298,3.1264,2.347,4.8305,0.2322,2.4958,2.8082,1.5506,1.8155,6.4954,0.959,0.5271,0.13,12.2456,0.6556,3.1863,0.1709,0.0918,0.0314,10.9576,0.4808,4.9122,1.2078,0.4521,6.3662,1.5966,1.7682,2.4613,0.0003,0.0016,0.0016,3.7768,1.5487,3.7059,0.3206,2.568,0.0778,2.5854,0.4185,3.235,2.7083,0.1127,0.0013,2.6543,2.8545,0.6233,0.934,5.6668,0.0052,3.9789,1.2775,1.5467,0.6173,0.9183,2.6505,0.2333,6.1805,0.179,5.9343,4.0123,2.5562,0.9934,0.2727,3.6766,5.2737,5.8575,4.8244,2.1704,0.1702,2.8719,0.6803,6.261,3.7579,4.7015,0.3925]}

This prompted the arrest of the two reporters.\nThey are expected to face up to five years in jail. Both have been charged with aiding and abetting a person under investigation in violation of secrecy laws.\n\"We urge the two journalists to cooperate with the investigation and to put an end to the smear campaign,\" he said.\nThe reporters' arrest has prompted calls for Myanmar to review its domestic laws to guarantee press and freedom of speech rights for citizens, which it has said will not be abrogated.\nThe government has also charged several activists and journalists for tweeting from their accounts on Myanmar-related issues. The government last year ordered the closure of several newspapers amid widespread allegations of bias against the government, with two among those media shuttered for being critical of the government.\nThe US State Department and other Western governments said earlier it was disappointed with the arrests.","token_len":264,"entropy":[11.1502,8.5982,11.8927,5.7036,5.0658,0.4117,4.6037,1.1209,2.715,3.1902,3.5348,0.4267,0.0831,8.3873,4.9886,1.774,0.0045,0.0024,0.0007,0.0004,0.0,0.0008,0.1707,1.6662,7.4624,1.3345,5.6268,0.2919,6.5138,0.4342,1.5197,4.5116,0.4809,3.0933,7.4272,9.7766,1.8624,5.1971,0.034,4.9957,8.818,2.9138,0.9003,0.6217,14.3136,3.5884,1.0896,1.6353,1.5669,3.2188,3.5124,2.7558,5.7521,0.9807,4.7673,1.1226,0.7417,2.2352,0.8547,1.6354,2.9847,1.7091,2.6528,2.3444,0.8868,5.0492,4.586,6.5019,0.359,2.2361,4.2881,1.9786,0.8736,8.4117,4.7612,1.8545,3.6235,3.2522,0.8929,3.0449,3.2747,1.1633,1.6662,7.0141,3.3483,1.9442,2.4094,1.6332,7.171,3.9944,1.3285,4.6717,0.1307,1.0959,1.8425,2.0229,1.3324,0.1764,5.0223,2.0318,3.6813,0.0305,1.5934,3.4234,0.0025,2.4376,0.0983,0.1067,1.166,1.5373,5.7037,2.1452,0.7631,1.7414,0.1397,5.6337,1.235,0.0038,0.0001,2.1627,5.4249,2.5585,2.3749,3.3736,4.8924,0.0027,4.0835,0.923,0.3344,0.2402,2.8834,1.9018,5.675,0.7564,5.7429,0.6771,0.4385,2.7936,1.2081,0.6952,2.1105,1.3948,1.6696,5.7831,2.753,0.0045,0.0044,1.3265,7.1791,0.2721,1.6392,6.4715,0.3555,0.7897,0.2167,1.5823,4.5339,2.332,2.2079,3.6716,2.6865,2.6952,0.6258,4.7451,0.6201,5.0581,0.5675,6.4715,1.276,1.8709,6.1111,4.0028,7.2743,4.0468,0.1391,2.1457,4.6881,2.5412,4.5623,2.0187,3.5084,3.172,1.0588,3.7752,4.8534,2.4328,0.3796,6.2532,1.1624,0.0003,0.4899,0.23,1.717,2.1156,0.9752,2.5561,5.361,3.6522,4.4834,1.896,1.1475,2.0325,6.3604,4.9303,2.0068,4.4207,2.5853,5.3131,3.4984,2.3088,2.2845,0.9178,2.7336,2.1822,5.904,1.1127,3.7509,1.6586,3.8216,0.0344,2.5613,2.8928,6.2018,3.1845,4.6441,0.4355,3.0775,1.2834,1.0408,1.414,2.3915,3.6578,5.1357,7.5538,1.3329,9.8878,1.315,0.7054,4.1277,4.3842,0.823,0.0239,0.5886,1.0429,0.2633,0.2313,1.617,5.9844,1.8799,0.0038,3.8922,2.3067,1.3496,1.3816,4.0744,3.9623,6.1675,1.1024,5.1076,1.9702,0.4111,2.9014,0.9359]}

To say something like 'our economy is growing by 6%' for over two years is an insult to common sense.\" However, he said the problem has been corrected by the introduction of various policy measures, including a sharp drop in interest rates, in 2009, citing evidence of the country's economic decline. Mirziyoyev said that the figures were now being revised downward. \"We have asked the economy ministry to look at the figures again and revise them a little downward,\" he said. As the economy has slowed and has become more dependent on oil revenue, Mirziyoyev said, the country's oil wealth may not be sufficient to cope with the negative effects of an \"extensive and deep recession\".

It was the first time Trump called a North Korean leader since 1953. The two leaders signed several agreements during the phone call. Some observers said China s involvement is likely to play a key role in achieving the goals of peace and stability in Northeast Asia, although some officials from both countries have voiced displeasure with each other since the Trump administration has expressed concerns about North Korea s weapons and missile programs, according to Xinhua.\nIn March 2017, there were tense rows over sanctions on Pyongyang s arms, but both sides had to back down after Xi came up with a proposal he described later as a \u201cfair and equitable negotiation\u201d. A year later, Xi and Kim agreed to work toward denuclearization at a summit in Singapore.","token_len":266,"entropy":[7.8564,1.8646,0.0311,4.7808,3.9492,5.2234,0.0314,0.4701,0.0799,0.2144,3.6832,0.0418,1.6532,4.3162,1.6729,7.6899,10.8084,7.7325,8.5091,0.0472,9.4315,0.3186,3.8473,2.4708,0.7009,0.4657,0.2576,3.7886,0.1328,2.0035,7.1693,0.0201,0.1722,0.7121,2.0481,1.0338,2.1988,2.3636,3.4588,0.5556,0.0015,0.1946,0.0067,0.4967,1.5934,1.6719,0.1369,0.2016,17.228,4.6641,5.8041,1.773,0.9897,0.0591,4.3759,2.2999,2.5738,0.4949,0.3462,3.3143,3.2412,4.7362,0.0851,6.0579,4.6256,1.4258,1.747,4.596,1.8843,3.0084,4.0334,4.0569,2.0945,3.8152,0.1567,3.8046,1.6557,3.0593,6.0618,6.9052,0.1136,0.9973,3.151,2.3457,3.7813,1.8825,0.84,4.1474,3.507,4.3914,3.2052,3.7084,1.0493,1.7923,1.4247,0.1441,1.6929,3.1424,7.6611,0.4185,0.2786,0.0019,0.3115,0.2437,1.5158,2.4213,2.8265,1.6691,3.9951,1.0356,3.4587,1.3521,2.8363,3.3473,6.315,6.3633,0.4835,2.3904,4.9667,0.4256,2.2352,0.4156,0.8789,2.011,5.4108,2.921,2.6071,0.0546,0.2217,1.0481,5.2166,0.9804,3.3809,1.8953,1.9066,5.3611,6.2416,2.262,2.1025,1.2428,4.7802,0.1199,1.5602,7.094,5.1387,1.9104,4.547,7.9613,6.8144,3.0556,2.2907,0.5784,4.3592,0.2462,2.0416,0.0399,0.2232,6.8847,1.687,3.5422,0.5658,5.321,0.5597,0.1044,0.4741,0.8138,0.0147,1.634,4.3931,3.1496,4.5965,6.8095,1.8702,0.7458,1.6185,3.8942,5.162,1.3982,6.3144,0.0508,4.0932,1.0181,4.3613,0.7938,4.1545,5.6914,3.2018,0.6066,1.3574,0.0722,4.3566,4.6811,3.0729,1.988,1.2553,2.855,2.278,0.003,4.1057,0.0082,0.1596,0.2152,3.1719,4.0797,4.5419,0.0538,6.1978,1.0003,6.9698,7.4377,1.2091,6.0503,1.5902,3.0462,7.1766,6.2477,2.898,2.9489,3.4783,0.3192,4.4094,3.3195,3.3773,1.6736,1.2971,5.0255,6.1691,4.4648,0.3427,0.6871,4.2869,6.9652,3.7944,9.7049,0.2846,1.268,17.8441,5.7066,9.0963,2.0728,3.1141,6.1184,4.9369,6.9699,0.9134,4.2659,3.905,0.2302,0.0902,2.5592,2.9697,2.5289,2.5196,0.5802,4.0314,2.3856,5.3991,0.0014,0.2783,5.4877,0.9349,0.6256,0.7716,5.4301,1.4442]}

Citing three Democratic","text":"Democratic U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump \u2019 s immigration policies, will not seek re-election next year, Politico reported on Monday. Citing three Democratic sources, Politico said Gutierrez will decide to not seek a fourth consecutive term after the January midterm elections. He will not seek re-election because of health reasons, Politico reported citing the three Democratic sources without giving further details. Gutierrez \u2019 s retirement will leave a space for an Illinois lawmaker with progressive views, Politico said. The report appeared to be based directly on the Democratic sources. Gutierrez, who began his political career under President Barack Obama, was one of the Trump administration \u2019 s most outspoken critics, with some of his comments and tweets often coming under scrutiny. The lawmaker \u2019 s latest comments in the past couple of weeks have drawn criticism \u2014 and questions about his health \u2014 from Democrats, with some of those comments made in March. While Gutierrez has repeatedly emphasized he has no ill health, there have been concerns he is just trying to play down a health issue that could be a deal-breaker for his Democratic opponents. After initially promising to reveal his health condition before he was forced to pull a medical leave of absence for an undisclosed illness in January, Gutierrez did not reveal as much in a subsequent article, Politico reported.","token_len":267,"entropy":[6.6403,0.1147,0.0279,0.0514,4.1472,6.5256,0.2251,2.3219,0.0969,1.2103,2.5544,5.4275,3.4946,0.016,2.066,1.3975,0.0156,14.1778,6.4579,8.9714,2.7637,0.7715,1.4542,5.9394,2.8795,3.8744,1.3212,0.0417,0.0022,2.833,0.1199,1.7928,4.6826,0.5006,2.3315,1.9606,0.1481,7.8966,0.4837,5.9809,3.7312,1.7628,0.4586,0.9636,1.304,0.8522,2.012,5.8136,2.4854,4.5502,0.3826,3.4177,2.874,5.8174,0.0884,3.568,1.818,5.8389,2.9863,0.1421,0.429,3.9807,1.8644,2.5019,1.5804,0.4561,0.0023,0.0003,3.8976,1.1115,5.8201,2.8899,0.8068,2.8925,1.5341,7.4667,2.9029,5.0569,1.0827,0.1913,7.7741,2.9613,1.0013,0.1198,0.1531,2.2609,9.5902,0.3111,4.6625,6.4073,3.2708,4.5389,3.2004,7.5325,0.4382,4.3828,4.8828,3.3524,3.1451,6.4346,1.8845,1.5623,2.4525,1.2201,0.2075,2.5829,4.8201,6.1595,0.2689,1.6395,1.8481,8.0604,0.0408,1.9455,3.3003,2.1911,1.3192,2.3209,2.3508,0.9513,6.2836,0.5927,1.4477,0.0463,6.7033,1.8369,1.1228,0.0123,0.5046,2.1539,2.9747,0.0045,0.8412,8.6548,1.3049,10.2469,0.5338,0.1881,1.3203,2.2391,0.2853,2.9936,3.6257,3.5301,2.3074,0.1949,3.6234,4.3592,2.5661,4.9494,4.5388,2.1167,1.4459,1.2396,2.8222,5.5448,5.9007,0.0654,0.0073,4.954,2.0496,4.5939,1.1537,2.0279,4.5457,0.4788,1.1084,1.4936,3.7515,1.2979,7.3686,3.1693,5.2379,2.142,0.7206,3.8899,1.2277,0.3304,2.9845,1.6441,3.5245,1.2935,2.6062,3.6639,1.2278,5.8672,1.5952,5.0021,1.507,4.8267,2.2694,1.329,3.6596,5.1745,3.8777,2.5051,1.4162,4.6864,1.1087,0.3385,4.6095,1.244,0.0807,3.0687,3.274,2.6984,6.1667,3.6101,0.0238,4.8291,3.9358,3.7136,3.0661,0.646,1.8529,2.7542,2.141,1.6806,6.3793,0.804,0.0182,0.74,1.6577,3.521,3.361,0.3945,5.2698,4.8128,4.6235,0.4727,7.4649,0.7274,0.6337,6.3844,3.925,3.1674,1.8534,5.0601,0.3019,4.3667,4.0493,4.9924,5.087,3.9452,0.0001,3.0612,3.6688,2.6727,3.9323,2.2226,2.4497,0.1308,1.0525,4.7172,0.2692,3.036,7.1273,0.1335,2.8075,2.2391,4.7656,6.2608,2.0944,1.0119,0.4384,0.2117]}

{"prompt":"An attack that killed more than 300 people in North Sinai has prompted Egyptian officials to renew efforts to enlist local tribes whose support will be critical in attempts to defeat Islamic State , security","text":"An attack that killed more than 300 people in North Sinai has prompted Egyptian officials to renew efforts to enlist local tribes whose support will be critical in attempts to defeat Islamic State, security officials reported last week. The Islamic State has pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's leader, who is reported be the self-described caliph. The group is also known by the Arabic and English names Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Islamic State, a name with which it was previously known and that it has used at various times in the group's history. An increasing number of members believe that al-Baghdadi's orders are to seize Iraq and create an Islamic state in the Middle East before marching on the West. The New York Times notes that Islamic State has already started to occupy areas that are outside Iraq's borders and that it has begun the process by which to move on Washington, D.C. The Times points out that a number of security agencies claim that they have intelligence reports that give a more sophisticated picture of the group than was previously believed, with sources indicating that it still controls many Iraqi military units, including some that are in the border with Syria. The report also notes that the group uses drones and other advanced weapons, and that it uses an online communication network to direct its operations.

{"prompt":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to sharply reduce the annual $ 300 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it take steps to stop making what lawmakers described as payments","text":"The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to sharply reduce the annual $ 300 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it take steps to stop making what lawmakers described as payments to terrorist groups. A Republican-led committee passed a measure to put the freeze on funding to the Palestinian Authority, a U.N.-backed entity, with 228 votes to 194. The House Democratic Caucus attempted to stop the funding freeze, but failed to reach an agreement on a compromise proposal. They ultimately voted by a 234-228 majority, in violation of the constitution, that the funds would not begin to be withheld until May. U.S. and Israeli officials have consistently criticized the Palestinian Authority\u2019s payments to groups involved in the 2014 murder of Israeli teenager Mohammed Fadel Shabbat, and have warned that the money could harm U.S.-backed negotiations. The Palestinians also have accepted a proposal from both the State Department and Congress to reduce the levels of aid to the Palestinians to levels they would normally receive. The House vote was expected to pass by a wide margin, the New York Times reported.

Ex-soccer star George Weah","text":"Liberia s supreme court cleared the way for a presidential run-off election, ruling on Thursday that it had not found enough evidence of fraud to halt the whole process. Ex-soccer star George Weah, was seen as the leading challenger to the democratically elected president in February, but lost to incumbent Ellen Johnson Sirleaf - who has served in office since 2007. The ruling says that a single inconclusive signature raised the possibility of fraud in the results from a vote at a key congressional seat, and that the president has not provided a comprehensive answer on that matter. But it stopped the order from the commission that would have declared the president - who has never before served two terms - legally unable to run again, saying she did not need to do so, as the party had not taken any action to remove her nomination. Sirleaf, who also serves as Liberia's vice president, had also failed to respond to a letter in 2011 claiming to have evidence of fraud in the presidential election, so this ruling may not be binding. President Sirleaf has yet to comment, but one of her allies told Reuters that the court's ruling was likely to give Johnson Sirleaf a victory in the run-off against Weah. There was no immediate reaction to the ruling from the UN-backed presidential commission, which had promised to take action to uncover claims of fraud. - Reuters","token_len":274,"entropy":[5.649,9.7354,10.851,1.4466,8.0891,1.1306,0.1594,0.1378,2.07,4.7565,2.8206,5.4058,0.0371,1.5044,2.4445,5.7578,1.8201,2.9604,0.1816,2.7022,2.874,2.4841,4.1959,1.751,0.6689,2.5877,2.0772,0.5714,6.8386,0.9015,9.5775,1.1677,0.2489,10.0152,0.8284,9.7557,4.4235,0.8046,5.6164,6.2588,3.1931,1.2871,7.8745,5.3059,2.0658,1.3935,4.7228,3.1944,0.725,1.9737,6.4422,0.1463,0.8367,2.6203,5.2726,1.6845,1.4451,4.7003,1.2925,3.2576,7.4489,0.7047,0.1284,0.0023,6.3197,0.8933,2.8818,5.2032,2.6169,3.9072,0.6651,3.7508,0.5042,2.2611,2.309,6.1218,1.5784,3.5975,4.6817,9.8795,0.0078,10.4151,7.9267,2.2228,1.2011,0.4208,2.6442,2.8953,1.0847,5.914,5.7394,2.7347,4.2462,5.2536,1.8939,5.6327,6.7057,3.7444,2.0231,2.1753,1.3421,1.4486,4.0514,3.6697,2.3713,4.7464,3.1057,5.8336,4.7954,1.8372,4.1184,4.0369,0.2066,4.3836,2.6956,7.9449,7.4155,8.1924,1.8222,5.8754,6.2659,3.1339,2.934,0.4883,6.0104,1.0508,4.7001,7.6282,1.0627,1.5044,3.549,5.8624,3.6032,6.3503,0.1009,0.9115,5.3288,4.5999,0.0207,0.2972,2.688,3.0037,2.8404,5.1719,3.21,0.0525,3.3393,0.6674,3.5779,0.1601,3.8949,3.2322,2.1235,5.8314,1.7862,3.7403,4.5102,1.9306,1.4034,1.0428,4.3283,0.9138,7.5681,0.5295,4.8494,0.0002,1.5475,0.739,4.3642,3.1073,0.3931,7.8825,0.0222,3.2011,0.7107,0.3547,2.8855,3.7744,4.1258,0.1459,4.472,0.1255,1.6019,3.174,3.7526,5.6938,5.6644,3.8333,0.3404,4.1708,0.5594,1.2907,1.8383,0.9407,2.6508,0.7628,1.4357,5.4154,4.987,2.001,3.7965,1.7923,1.6163,3.2715,0.9547,5.4979,5.5542,0.0007,2.1486,4.8361,0.0024,3.7382,2.7223,1.1052,5.4392,1.1218,0.5482,4.7395,2.8734,1.99,1.3754,1.4855,2.8756,1.3279,1.1981,1.4406,3.8631,0.2286,4.2886,6.3451,0.7593,0.0001,1.3237,4.148,2.1151,0.7522,3.0894,0.0661,0.012,5.186,3.8006,0.0012,0.5428,5.505,1.739,1.3771,1.0522,1.9825,1.5975,0.3257,0.3285,1.774,1.0699,5.8348,5.1667,0.3511,2.5902,1.5612,1.0263,0.2658,2.6406,6.2557,0.5142,3.4429,1.9781,2.0861,7.3481,7.2865,0.1992,0.7259,0.9799,6.6759,1.8742]}

He remains free except for this order, meaning he can legally leave the United States. He is expected to be in prison on Monday.\nHowever, Manafort is still free to leave the nation legally since the criminal contempt charge stems from a plea agreement he entered into last July, after which he admitted lying to the government in connection to Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.\nAccording to the jail records, he was ordered to surrender Sept. 29 at 7 a.m., but he never got out of his luxury apartment. Police were called when he didn\u2019t show up, and when they did not find him in the apartment, they left a message with Manafort\u2019s office that he had a court-ordered warrant for his arrest.\nLater, a spokesman for Manafort confirmed with CBS News that Manafort had requested a few days to deal with the issue.","token_len":275,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,5.8548,2.5675,1.7635,2.7796,5.6623,1.2149,0.007,14.1535,6.55,8.3648,5.9036,2.1788,0.6478,0.6211,0.0002,0.883,6.483,3.0297,7.4487,2.9792,2.6867,9.5844,2.6208,1.5405,0.982,0.5518,2.4382,5.9143,3.8557,1.2822,1.396,1.7864,8.6606,4.8539,3.5824,5.0625,0.1199,0.144,0.5462,0.7365,14.6695,1.85,1.4504,6.167,0.4054,5.106,0.182,2.7802,2.9228,8.8023,0.0165,0.0076,0.011,0.0008,0.8221,0.4439,3.9986,1.7409,7.2139,1.0169,0.0034,3.647,0.0049,3.438,2.3246,4.3776,2.9629,3.8897,1.3188,2.7877,0.0089,3.0935,3.5624,3.9802,3.0695,2.4089,4.8547,1.3727,2.8386,5.2855,0.1986,3.0153,2.2793,0.7289,5.1285,4.7942,0.4554,3.6276,0.3854,1.669,0.3719,4.2346,4.4017,1.7647,7.0698,0.3013,6.4613,4.4889,1.4575,5.2049,0.5655,1.6972,6.2293,2.8826,0.5203,2.7321,0.0018,1.875,4.292,1.7658,2.5673,0.0696,1.2644,2.8978,4.0577,2.3821,3.8162,1.0199,0.245,5.3572,0.0393,3.4067,3.0664,2.845,3.0709,1.5019,2.5829,0.6495,5.4788,5.7723,7.1766,2.1195,5.7502,3.6607,2.6864,3.9512,0.0528,1.9265,4.4557,0.8063,1.1082,2.8203,0.8948,3.0757,3.3377,2.0858,3.3629,2.8661,0.288,4.0836,4.7891,0.3669,1.1919,5.0459,3.0906,4.1496,3.2848,8.9345,9.7019,0.4637,0.3436,1.4059,1.2464,1.7846,3.7951,0.7345,0.6182,0.4369,0.0315,0.4032,0.4738,4.4895,0.0039,1.332,8.7674,2.6104,0.4107,3.6989,1.625,3.88,0.209,1.3224,8.3744,0.0081,2.3269,3.4915,3.1917,1.509,0.0004,0.0001,1.6364,2.3033,1.9833,5.2453,3.6732,2.4875,1.1029,1.9909,7.7396,4.0246,1.6349,6.604,3.5654,1.0742,3.5631,0.6797,4.6871,4.4375,0.2155,0.9605,1.0214,0.0275,2.1943,0.9386,2.7623,1.3178,2.737,3.9453,3.1635,0.1377,2.5754,1.4222,1.1521,0.8503,1.453,4.8295,3.1983,2.4232,2.6444,2.313,3.4301,0.0062,0.0903,5.4569,3.5158,2.486,1.753,4.4639,4.7897,2.3496,0.4063,3.7257,1.1277,0.2508,0.1399,0.4253,0.3612,4.9927,1.7063,3.3436,4.9424,0.0583,1.0539,4.1884,5.0346,4.3654,0.3096,0.2031,2.7372,1.5431,5.4689,1.218,8.1954,1.0413,2.8173,7.8538,0.0325,0.7084,4.1242,1.3267]}

A Saudi-led military coalition fighting Houthi rebels has been fighting over access points to deliver supplies of water, food and medicine. Reuters said the coalition had closed some ports for trucks carrying humanitarian relief supplies, saying it also threatened rebels without permission to cross a border crossing meant only for supplies for government forces. In a statement on Sunday, Houthis denied blocking trucks from the Red Sea port in Hodeida, and said they had permitted all trucks to enter the port. The statement also claimed the coalition attacked the city of Taiz, where three trucks carrying medical supplies for Hodeida were reportedly attacked by gunfire. \u201cIn Yemen, parties must stop arbitrary restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid,\u201d said the U.N. envoy for famine in Yemen, Babatunde Osotimehin. \u201cThey must do so to help protect the people from suffering.\u201d The Houthi rebels who took power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014 are working to end years of civil war and control the country\u2019s main seaports and critical energy resources.

Protesters in Sanaa shouted slogans such as \u201cthe people demand justice\u201d and demanded the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\nMany were waving a black scarf, a symbol of mourning for victims of the downing of a state plane last week that killed some 82 people, including 58 Egyptians and a British tourist.\nProtestors are staging demonstrations almost daily to express their anger against the regime, which was strengthened over the last year by army and security forces which have gained control from the nationalist- Salafist militia militias.","token_len":277,"entropy":[8.4154,4.1921,10.5586,1.5855,3.8682,0.1845,1.5165,1.1097,6.1052,10.0044,0.3405,5.4123,0.5394,0.874,2.6254,0.4974,0.0121,1.3285,0.8031,2.0716,0.6903,0.2951,0.2903,0.0,3.316,0.4734,1.145,7.4548,0.4135,2.5522,4.5874,0.0434,0.2002,5.1188,0.6059,1.3372,7.7921,1.0641,3.0238,1.2714,4.9908,1.3356,2.2364,3.3082,5.0189,1.737,2.8902,1.8549,3.4847,16.4104,8.4118,4.225,7.4685,7.0158,4.946,0.1758,4.9738,2.5715,14.5564,4.0002,4.9762,2.9302,5.3895,3.5027,7.856,1.1637,3.775,6.1375,2.4124,1.5374,1.4056,7.9262,0.502,11.2373,0.9482,1.5721,16.1019,0.2304,6.7178,5.8835,3.3746,3.4116,1.2569,7.7227,0.9193,0.0011,0.6043,0.702,5.7147,1.258,3.0346,0.1051,3.3583,8.2721,2.6018,4.972,4.6765,10.8768,0.9152,1.3686,2.5043,0.5637,2.2419,3.4767,4.4107,1.995,2.7329,0.1008,0.0029,1.1473,6.4968,0.4449,2.219,1.1568,2.4372,2.4539,5.5382,0.8778,3.3462,3.7984,1.1023,4.7283,4.7596,0.9554,8.18,0.0544,0.0258,2.0683,5.5336,2.4513,1.3873,5.6061,3.0401,3.8429,1.1972,3.8003,0.0675,4.061,3.7407,1.6502,0.7224,1.9299,4.4834,5.0523,2.1731,5.2844,2.7511,5.3631,0.016,1.157,4.8456,8.1354,2.4823,1.347,0.737,0.0041,1.4434,8.3076,2.3416,6.5001,4.2743,4.1665,0.0051,5.2677,0.5356,0.0009,0.2662,0.8918,4.7584,2.2561,5.3598,0.3296,5.1983,1.1123,1.7086,0.0041,9.3681,5.9557,5.2001,3.5538,6.334,1.718,2.264,8.007,0.7044,3.9056,1.8475,2.3916,0.0418,1.578,2.1195,0.0036,0.0026,0.0034,0.7581,0.9715,4.7534,5.191,6.0836,3.9354,4.9087,5.0951,1.8331,2.708,1.6903,0.0422,4.1237,0.8547,3.6329,0.2448,0.8126,5.4774,0.0007,0.0778,0.8879,6.9161,2.0732,4.9184,1.7071,3.9135,0.4211,6.8127,5.9866,0.2266,1.8925,0.6097,5.9808,8.7562,1.7041,3.29,2.3462,2.3224,0.3875,1.0285,5.7663,1.5404,0.3018,4.1055,6.3426,2.6418,8.7683,0.601,3.4077,3.5537,0.704,1.9236,3.2542,0.5845,4.9159,2.1644,1.1354,4.5689,8.2658,4.4007,0.3222,2.3167,1.5132,1.1685,7.5641,2.3622,2.2844,0.3608,5.7251,1.2476,6.6955,2.3324,5.3551,0.8835,9.4379,5.3998,12.2415,0.8767,0.0851,6.5846,7.6565,1.0089]}

Edward M. Kennedy and Robert A. Casey, D-Calif. And it has been endorsed by the White House, with President George W. Bush and the Congressional Budget Office touting it favorably.\nIf Congress passes the bill, many U.S. companies would be required to calculate their taxable profit as if they were operating in a 35 percent tax-rate environment. That would allow them to benefit from tax breaks like unlimited depreciation allowances, which would have to be reported on their tax returns.\nThe House of Representatives is currently debating a bill to increase the top rate to 46 percent. But tax experts say a bill approved next month by the Senate would likely be quickly taken up by the chamber after the Nov. 4 presidential election and be approved without a lot of political wrangling.","token_len":277,"entropy":[8.8763,8.433,1.6353,0.0683,0.1572,7.2815,6.7139,7.2109,0.3124,0.7132,3.1835,0.8677,1.1395,0.0058,5.8729,1.8103,9.8485,1.4257,10.5426,6.6984,8.5105,0.7865,5.9638,2.3433,5.9332,0.735,1.2578,16.5919,0.5781,1.5146,1.8151,1.1222,7.0776,0.0651,3.2607,2.9859,0.3791,0.2358,4.3529,1.8813,1.62,0.0313,0.2938,0.446,14.153,3.9958,5.789,3.5935,0.5282,0.6551,2.3978,1.0319,3.6605,0.6063,3.2287,0.9468,1.0884,0.0487,0.8013,6.0273,0.8047,3.2346,0.0156,1.3862,0.433,0.0656,3.7662,0.3966,1.1124,3.432,4.7988,0.8499,5.8872,4.9847,0.8603,1.2319,1.1214,7.7603,2.1427,2.1333,6.3238,2.7719,5.4185,2.8992,3.5494,3.9395,3.3743,1.8779,0.422,1.4066,3.7648,4.1937,1.3313,2.8076,4.6468,0.0004,0.0012,0.0101,1.5837,0.2934,0.392,1.4756,3.8737,2.7528,2.684,3.7853,4.4038,3.1376,3.5814,1.181,0.3341,0.1801,2.3217,1.9194,3.1791,4.7505,0.0049,1.923,0.0012,5.2295,3.1434,0.0005,0.1609,3.1295,4.0581,2.1326,0.0003,1.7526,2.3097,2.6222,0.0104,5.6025,1.2379,5.5785,1.2106,2.3305,1.2139,3.4912,0.0266,2.0415,2.1763,0.0005,0.8436,3.8127,2.9788,4.6148,0.1139,0.0003,0.0004,1.9633,3.0197,5.7511,0.1118,0.0005,6.6032,1.1824,4.9201,0.3401,0.2831,5.4847,4.6483,1.4641,0.3751,1.2849,0.5,5.0319,3.4773,0.0002,0.0019,0.0017,1.1724,0.9225,1.4993,2.8439,0.0468,7.2512,0.9107,2.7208,4.715,3.6389,3.0312,0.4768,0.7906,3.5485,0.4373,1.6261,7.3037,0.2608,1.4198,3.6984,5.7921,3.5815,0.6537,2.9617,0.7664,3.2493,0.7885,0.0514,5.5301,0.2538,4.2116,1.0905,3.275,10.4101,4.6284,3.0652,1.1543,1.9653,1.7036,4.0764,2.4594,0.2488,4.9229,1.3045,1.2008,2.9738,0.5893,0.9094,0.3639,1.8835,4.3832,3.4463,0.006,2.5489,3.1731,1.8742,1.021,1.6521,1.3291,2.3375,0.3237,3.3346,1.7593,1.4348,6.2395,0.2557,2.135,3.0331,5.4967,0.877,0.918,3.3189,3.2008,5.5568,6.2314,1.6499,1.4046,0.6136,0.4747,0.823,3.3721,2.0948,6.4707,5.1959,0.0291,0.5363,0.5239,7.3117,4.8567,1.3645,6.727,0.0004,2.3466,3.4073,0.0876,3.1442,4.0015,3.7532,4.5483,1.9815,6.9306,0.0047,3.7489,2.7427,0.0085,0.2154]}

Thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on Lesbos after a Greek government crackdown on arrivals to Europe via the Greek islands. This move leaves thousands more trapped on the island, with no way to reach the western Aegean mainland. Read the full article here on the Telegraph.co.uk website.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of politics today is the way that the media has begun to speak openly about race and racism. In fact, many journalists have taken to openly discussing their own racial background in interview formats that include a table for the viewer to name themselves.\nIf there were ever a problem that should have been handled in a more open fashion, it is race. One of my greatest fears as a writer and a journalist is for the future of America. When did we all start turning our back on our own beliefs and values in favor of something that doesn\u2019t actually make America that great it is.\nA while back, I was reading through a magazine and saw a bunch of stories that seemed to have nothing to do with the story at hand. They were about the owner, the staff, how the owner raised his kids and gave them what he had\u2026 I was fascinated and started reading through them.","token_len":278,"entropy":[8.4974,4.8155,3.7341,6.5825,3.0631,5.6988,3.5043,5.7781,2.6919,0.0065,1.387,2.1803,2.9609,0.5986,2.0832,0.0675,0.8981,1.977,3.3819,2.991,1.9579,1.0326,0.0066,2.7157,2.9163,0.0263,1.8508,3.975,3.3406,0.5049,8.0624,0.5225,2.3576,0.5405,0.0144,1.431,6.7391,0.3724,1.7762,4.2476,0.0006,2.955,2.4508,3.73,1.8612,2.315,0.6675,5.7854,4.1752,1.3196,7.4787,1.2515,2.3302,0.8335,1.1436,6.4905,4.5273,6.1669,3.3335,3.1652,4.5003,1.2535,0.4796,0.4477,1.9823,2.1144,3.2423,1.5557,0.5914,3.0768,1.6098,6.8558,2.2239,0.0002,0.0003,3.4163,0.7266,6.6007,3.6742,0.6991,3.2474,0.9226,5.8241,1.8333,6.1593,1.0924,4.8474,0.0024,0.002,3.1753,0.6315,0.2952,11.8361,1.1035,0.2411,1.537,5.4083,2.6367,0.1522,10.4234,4.6023,0.3542,0.9276,3.7234,2.2059,1.525,3.4954,2.1518,6.4475,0.2092,5.558,4.5976,0.2642,6.3502,1.3193,4.1338,0.8004,2.5379,3.9189,0.2174,3.0985,3.156,1.3084,3.6813,1.4805,5.8229,2.8465,3.7448,1.4193,3.6276,3.6216,2.6448,7.6474,7.2231,3.7228,4.1467,3.1883,8.4357,5.0734,2.2614,6.7576,0.246,7.0724,6.901,0.7119,1.9469,5.087,3.6623,2.5612,2.5074,0.4824,5.0253,4.1015,3.9723,1.1981,0.4964,4.7481,2.916,1.2616,1.572,1.7427,3.0208,0.3859,0.6241,1.0236,3.815,1.0842,4.6237,0.7674,3.7205,5.7452,1.824,3.4855,0.2389,3.2128,2.5362,2.0127,1.375,0.9196,3.7573,1.426,3.0719,0.126,5.745,1.5935,3.9905,7.0754,1.4606,3.496,1.5102,5.8865,1.759,2.1804,0.0976,2.5064,2.0001,6.5373,1.132,2.4026,3.5772,2.6676,0.0014,4.2294,1.1096,4.7131,16.0996,7.4836,2.271,5.0768,3.3504,5.2917,6.4555,2.4307,7.5403,1.6003,2.6292,1.4158,4.3564,6.3793,0.4123,0.8403,0.9249,2.1898,3.6453,3.6926,1.3541,4.3999,4.6656,2.2356,1.0639,6.0604,0.0027,2.6399,2.6738,3.9169,0.3771,3.5382,3.0296,0.1416,0.0157,0.0039,3.8366,5.1651,4.1809,0.9105,0.336,3.8717,1.5086,2.2427,1.8082,9.8165,3.8992,2.1662,6.3011,0.8119,5.089,1.8269,2.5847,7.2779,1.4829,2.1537,1.3875,5.6866,0.5168,5.6462,1.5946,2.7761,7.2956,3.6076,2.0485,5.3251,2.7035,5.5169,1.8238,2.0318,1.4172,0.7145]}

During the longest debt limit stalemate in October and November last year, Washington did not have enough money for key tasks \u2013 such as paying social security and Medicare premiums from a fund with about $ 800 billion left. \u2013 The debt ceiling has been raised once before this budget year, in August, by President Barack Obama.","token_len":278,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,4.5105,2.1499,2.9536,1.8473,1.4292,6.1484,1.1755,4.2381,8.2248,1.3163,1.8233,3.1265,2.1522,2.7461,4.6623,5.6825,0.1306,13.6863,0.2969,0.8557,10.4231,3.6841,1.3836,1.5448,2.7762,5.3162,5.2175,12.9912,7.4553,1.4806,3.8514,3.5971,0.0599,6.6818,0.2552,0.5986,0.9432,0.9836,0.0936,0.2234,14.5995,3.3854,15.0032,9.1115,0.9513,3.6357,4.9683,0.5352,5.2537,4.9667,5.4659,0.098,1.5871,1.9412,2.9527,7.7193,2.5434,4.7368,1.4783,3.0261,0.1593,0.0092,0.2898,4.9969,0.9082,6.1047,2.8263,0.1205,2.4736,6.921,4.8173,7.1318,0.0764,3.6285,1.3508,3.8693,2.5818,1.996,2.1154,2.8835,0.9846,1.7387,0.2274,4.0349,1.8353,6.0635,3.6278,2.1307,0.0042,2.3435,0.2076,0.3785,1.7842,4.7438,0.5263,2.0491,3.3611,0.1651,0.8193,4.562,2.2337,3.33,1.2656,1.2004,3.7174,10.6681,0.467,0.0183,2.8986,3.4907,1.135,5.3922,5.2325,0.147,1.7987,8.1856,5.4079,0.6196,3.315,6.8434,6.2072,0.0017,0.6223,2.5636,4.2219,4.2299,5.0903,2.1945,5.4303,4.1436,1.7659,8.2552,2.4522,0.3595,5.124,5.0732,3.8746,3.1613,1.7684,1.6451,1.9706,3.6398,1.0429,2.1272,1.5928,1.0824,3.7255,3.2703,3.5963,1.3361,5.446,0.3931,4.9556,3.3093,1.1247,1.9735,2.855,5.3807,2.9943,1.3566,4.6389,6.6543,3.6566,3.7159,4.4067,5.5486,0.3038,0.0985,2.3827,1.0537,0.3827,0.8255,3.0523,0.0108,0.0902,0.0063,0.0031,1.0205,0.1472,0.5178,6.7924,3.6923,1.7938,1.8082,3.0766,0.8942,3.0912,1.0654,4.9717,0.2075,4.4876,3.9966,2.0563,1.6933,5.4384,0.0056,0.7013,5.0789,6.3507,10.0983,1.2893,0.0119,4.1903,7.3102,1.6622,5.5312,5.1098,4.7653,3.4134,2.0485,0.2574,3.2409,4.377,0.5985,7.6877,4.6684,1.7664,5.3923,0.0009,0.9396,9.0426,3.7679,0.2941,5.9881,0.0199,0.0628,3.6418,5.3244,0.2634,2.9374,1.0564,0.6716,2.6528,7.656,6.8665,4.6276,1.258,0.0015,3.3057,7.5105,0.6618,0.7604,0.6031,3.3249,7.2496,4.0812,6.3582,5.355,5.1854,0.3612,5.6753,0.2969,5.0637,2.2552,9.5062,2.8961,2.0449,1.2164,2.0333,0.0873,15.82,3.2776,2.0114,3.5023,5.786,0.756,0.5968,2.7913,4.0741,2.0407,3.7686,3.9804,0.6031,0.0022,1.5783]}

Sokolow & Associates and receives millions of dollars in government money for head and neck cancer research.\nThe charity was founded in 2009 after World War 11, when the Khan's then-governor general had a daughter with the disease, the ethics watchdog said.","token_len":279,"entropy":[8.6489,0.0246,1.3068,0.0012,8.5961,5.5597,10.4975,2.1922,0.0311,0.3778,1.6144,0.1519,4.4306,1.4848,9.2576,5.9524,1.127,3.7805,1.4907,10.8655,0.7256,0.0009,7.7595,5.4827,1.9175,2.5011,2.6494,7.562,0.5951,0.8378,2.2724,1.6707,3.7088,3.9248,1.0218,6.3577,1.7859,1.2011,0.1919,3.1452,1.5075,3.3125,0.2946,0.7792,0.1359,20.5301,0.7736,2.3788,1.5908,2.5613,7.1047,3.1432,0.8612,4.018,3.8977,6.2973,3.344,1.5953,3.2145,3.7858,4.8126,6.7021,0.0031,4.6416,2.6782,2.5591,2.7278,6.168,6.3842,1.3114,4.4824,5.1682,0.1664,1.7987,2.6554,1.6173,0.1199,0.0174,4.1367,0.135,9.5367,4.8702,4.5327,4.3993,4.3666,5.429,2.4295,0.2057,0.8675,4.9673,3.7938,1.292,5.8728,3.6551,9.5474,0.1714,3.2732,0.9126,2.2371,1.1108,1.2634,0.1563,1.542,2.0992,0.6974,2.5648,4.9995,1.081,5.1755,0.3247,1.4598,1.2622,4.0944,3.0896,2.5285,7.6215,1.5216,0.2078,5.7576,3.9832,1.3935,0.2093,3.7179,4.9687,1.4037,0.344,1.0441,4.3226,0.2201,2.4316,0.3802,2.5281,2.1919,4.7534,0.0332,3.932,4.6139,2.521,0.7057,3.9715,3.5203,5.1632,1.0979,0.4572,1.1129,0.2371,5.8225,0.8167,3.0708,3.9229,1.885,0.8204,2.1984,2.129,6.951,0.013,0.9885,3.2718,1.0888,5.4622,2.3714,1.6897,2.7272,1.0715,2.7215,10.0737,0.0245,0.0106,9.005,8.1182,5.442,1.7209,3.1505,3.1807,1.8817,0.2219,0.4477,5.1279,0.1465,0.9792,3.1353,7.958,0.9344,0.0048,1.1904,9.0016,0.8607,0.2308,4.7525,0.0613,0.0008,0.0012,1.9715,0.6333,2.1139,3.2191,3.2284,0.1975,0.5146,4.0211,0.5998,4.4761,0.9735,3.2215,0.5639,2.6001,0.0765,0.5094,0.8043,5.5617,9.763,4.5534,0.659,1.1706,1.4595,1.2956,1.6965,2.0277,3.6626,4.0325,0.0379,2.7007,2.8262,8.0126,3.9676,5.6574,0.0164,0.0074,3.9483,1.5966,3.7804,7.1677,2.8051,1.0604,0.0329,1.3494,2.257,3.425,3.4947,7.4275,0.9311,0.0411,1.1191,0.8446,0.4959,0.2061,1.5408,2.7692,2.7127,2.4782,0.6528,3.1064,3.9403,8.034,0.1799,11.1846,1.5743,1.3702,1.7312,7.9994,5.0625,5.9342,0.4316,6.5983,0.0164,8.7786,5.0442,2.3279,4.2691,2.0281,2.395,2.4317,1.7045,2.8057,1.3665,0.0515,0.1041,0.1346]}

Trump also has a long history of underlining the importance of tax cuts or tax cuts being part of legislation in other bills he has pushed with bipartisan backing.","token_len":282,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2193,0.3207,0.021,7.0601,4.9165,7.59,0.1167,2.0258,0.0038,1.1673,1.8323,1.5464,1.8271,8.3787,7.947,4.3073,0.1879,3.9157,5.3005,0.5659,0.0069,1.2272,1.86,3.6492,6.0898,1.4128,0.6002,5.9411,4.3922,3.4536,0.6782,0.9855,6.4714,3.2718,2.9489,1.7287,1.3205,0.5191,1.1192,4.1371,0.7776,0.4162,0.1993,0.1571,18.8721,4.7319,0.0194,4.4745,1.0944,1.5948,6.6888,6.0021,4.424,0.6541,4.9001,0.8099,2.1587,3.9513,2.6788,4.1263,0.225,4.418,2.5112,2.8454,0.5619,0.2674,4.6648,0.0764,0.0003,2.9975,1.1758,12.7322,2.0479,5.6815,1.496,2.5946,0.6304,6.0133,4.0158,2.9477,2.0542,2.847,0.7413,1.0168,3.6039,7.3891,1.404,3.1104,3.4895,0.0906,5.7392,2.8867,3.9732,6.6379,1.8062,0.1798,0.0121,2.1824,5.4771,1.3457,1.3469,5.7566,2.9069,1.5312,2.4695,4.0074,0.0711,5.23,0.3355,4.2865,1.4691,0.0615,2.6487,1.938,2.3426,6.9085,0.9365,1.469,1.6632,4.6012,5.2519,4.152,5.9315,4.4238,0.9831,1.2047,0.5706,0.0505,2.7884,0.921,2.8946,5.2704,2.7526,1.3662,0.166,6.8991,0.4684,0.815,0.2695,0.7905,0.136,12.8774,9.4807,6.3639,3.522,5.8875,7.4675,4.3071,4.568,4.0028,6.9811,8.5777,4.1044,2.0967,3.535,1.6041,3.7555,2.6263,5.3659,12.4054,0.714,9.3556,0.0362,0.0238,0.0202,0.4822,4.7032,4.5388,3.6362,0.2189,3.0432,2.6731,7.8637,3.1115,0.6339,1.1949,1.631,9.9164,0.0516,1.1618,2.1674,4.0631,0.457,4.0208,0.1876,5.6024,8.4421,7.1708,2.4485,5.2844,0.5901,3.38,3.0328,8.5417,3.654,1.6905,1.6482,2.7329,1.8627,1.8131,5.1714,6.1084,10.0782,10.5425,0.1185,4.6291,6.9519,3.3151,0.0258,4.8406,16.4339,0.5946,6.7042,4.2472,0.8005,0.7549,2.5178,4.2222,1.2678,2.9678,0.4889,0.2623,0.2057,3.0624,3.2089,6.4093,1.8864,2.9067,0.1561,4.9317,2.3718,0.3274,0.0048,5.3846,3.284,2.7183,3.5544,1.8468,1.1916,1.9592,5.9565,0.4271,1.0687,2.4491,1.2758,1.1587,2.2551,5.1179,3.5827,2.7242,3.9972,2.6676,0.8875,0.0968,6.3823,4.3472,1.8367,1.7312,0.007,3.1642,1.4127,6.5364,3.2573,2.1416,5.3236,3.4669,0.001,6.2035,3.7564,4.3383,5.2457,2.6576,1.5499,3.8671,5.4621,3.4883,3.013,0.4023]}

The court ruled against Funes\u2019 daughters, including Maria Julia de Funes, who was elected in 2015 as the new first lady of El Salvador. The case had been submitted in 2014 on the grounds that from his positions as president and father of the candidate \u2013 who was elected as the new president in 2014 \u2013 Funes, as well as his son Mauricio Funes Espino, had enriched themselves illegally. According to the plaintiffs, when they were in office, they took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and illegal payments via companies established by relatives. The judge ordered that Funes be jailed for one year and a day and ordered a fine for the sum that the judge imposed. The case took a year and three months to reach a final verdict. The court of first instance said that during the investigation it discovered that Funes entered a contract at night, in 2015, to lease the company he had founded on the name of his son Mauricio Funes Espinoza to a construction company, giving the latter a loan of approximately $ 500,000.

Moscow","text":"Russia is ready to act as a mediator between North Korea and the United States if both parties are willing for it to play such a role, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. Moscow has been a staunch supporter of N. Korea's nuclear program, and is worried about a potential diplomatic rift between Washington and Pyongyang. \" It appears that both sides want to see a solution, \" Moscow's foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that both sides have come to a point where they could agree on a mediating party. The United States announced last week it would halt new nuclear and ballistic missile tests, a move intended to be a sign of good will toward N. Korea. However, North Korea has not responded positively to the U.S. effort to deescalate the standoff with Seoul nor has it stopped its long-range missile tests. North Korea has conducted multiple missile tests in recent weeks and appears to have increased its military activity, including a surprise exercise of a large scale air strike that could have involved bombers and missile launchers. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned North Korea about the consequences of what he called dangerous actions, especially during the time of the U.S. president-elect Joe Biden. The election has come just weeks after North Korea shot down two American war planes that flew through its airspace in November. North Korea is a nuclear power and has been accused of having several nuclear and plutonium weapons.","token_len":284,"entropy":[3.8827,4.4392,0.2148,5.0339,2.6501,0.6117,3.2577,0.0131,1.3102,5.346,0.1939,0.108,0.526,1.1946,0.0296,4.1006,6.8102,2.7627,2.5094,1.219,6.7986,2.3855,0.3196,5.584,5.6307,0.2539,1.3098,1.2557,2.5738,5.6059,0.7877,1.5271,2.015,0.2493,6.198,1.7637,2.1011,4.1549,3.0343,1.1581,0.014,8.5362,0.8328,0.1816,0.9943,1.1611,0.585,1.4731,1.4929,3.5995,4.5179,1.1017,2.7305,2.8535,5.0812,2.7958,1.427,2.1537,0.017,0.1921,0.7312,4.3971,11.4735,4.4585,0.4914,3.9875,0.504,3.5431,0.3648,3.3684,1.8534,4.4245,2.9609,6.4264,4.3205,1.1904,2.2615,0.3371,0.4579,0.5852,0.1541,0.1371,2.2939,1.596,0.1653,4.2124,0.2589,2.3981,6.308,0.4387,1.5087,4.5917,0.4159,0.9574,3.607,3.0168,1.1272,0.8863,5.71,1.4735,6.4359,0.7003,2.124,2.9623,0.068,7.0855,2.0821,0.7925,1.3542,0.6652,4.9653,6.0277,3.0034,2.9898,2.815,0.0807,0.2358,1.8261,3.3973,0.4971,5.1873,0.0253,5.7164,1.8749,2.7936,0.5679,5.0939,2.1387,2.1052,5.5207,0.0052,0.0098,0.7477,4.4478,0.0098,2.9803,0.0826,1.0884,2.8421,3.2165,3.9403,0.1755,0.7017,2.8614,0.0004,0.1425,0.1134,5.1661,0.9447,5.5808,2.2653,0.0055,1.416,3.7542,2.7926,2.6535,10.7042,0.5006,0.5793,5.8281,2.1295,4.9092,0.1167,0.774,1.2229,1.4752,0.4892,2.8937,0.1035,1.1459,2.8623,4.3437,1.7427,0.637,1.45,0.395,1.2879,2.396,5.2828,0.4175,1.2378,5.7683,0.2559,2.8533,1.714,2.5152,2.753,1.7355,6.2943,8.0508,2.5538,2.7766,4.6795,6.5258,4.3713,2.0896,3.0514,3.9125,2.3478,5.0494,6.1234,1.5607,4.0468,1.1804,0.3847,3.4327,0.001,0.1124,0.0253,3.667,0.0426,4.2525,0.3687,4.3897,4.118,0.0435,3.6345,1.0467,3.7283,0.2533,5.4975,0.6243,0.3653,8.1336,2.0985,1.8079,4.9041,4.8301,0.9984,6.3573,0.4485,1.2445,2.3684,0.0004,0.4518,0.3118,4.0237,4.1772,0.0045,11.968,0.2887,1.1862,2.4221,8.0428,2.753,4.9471,3.1156,2.1045,0.2448,1.1428,0.078,5.6032,0.0344,3.0025,3.1522,2.6665,3.8719,2.6219,0.7772,5.04,1.1622,0.2469,2.8885,5.8065,0.6971,2.4607,0.0872,2.8497,3.3728,2.3779,1.4323,1.2568,1.1185,2.1868,4.1052,0.2483,4.0592,4.7847,0.9147,2.9743,8.6709,1.7636,1.2065]}

Asked if a vote was still possible, Social Protection Minister Mary Harney said that she and her opposition coalition partner Sinn Fein needed to see more detail from the IMF on their proposals in the last few days before making their decision.\nIf there\u2019s an election, it will provide an opportunity to further the negotiation process. At this point, if a choice has to be made between a budget or a snap election, then they would choose that. But if the proposal from the government and the IMF are to be seriously considered, then these issues must be resolved by the end of this week.\nAnd the deadline that Harney has issued to her opposition is likely to take the pressure in the ongoing budget negotiations away from the government of Prime Minister Enda Kenny.\nHarney said on Monday that she had been informed that \u201cvery few of the provisions in the budget bill we will have made will be passed, despite our initial optimism, given opposition by Sinn Fein and other members of the coalition.\u201d","token_len":285,"entropy":[8.3683,12.5546,1.1501,4.2354,3.8281,3.3423,3.6167,5.2633,1.2214,2.0089,5.1327,8.6596,0.2186,2.5511,0.7542,5.5882,1.7249,5.959,0.2067,4.085,7.8577,9.1405,2.6227,0.7986,1.4244,5.2251,2.4181,3.5699,10.3348,0.8639,3.0445,0.8708,4.4681,2.8032,6.8386,1.7684,1.161,3.1087,5.6424,1.1404,4.2036,1.441,2.5438,5.4103,5.3028,3.0762,0.2184,0.9633,6.7952,2.3175,1.6413,6.3775,0.1198,0.5396,3.1976,2.1549,2.3142,0.9415,8.3086,1.5895,5.867,0.2046,4.2637,3.0588,3.1241,0.0131,0.2282,0.8429,0.4786,15.5334,4.484,2.6556,1.4325,6.2599,3.8917,0.7704,0.9321,5.7333,0.0256,0.0002,5.5825,6.165,1.4543,3.7348,2.746,2.3204,4.3697,0.291,0.6775,7.8544,2.4221,0.0474,4.8365,7.537,3.7699,0.3955,3.2278,2.5399,4.2463,1.0335,5.7135,4.7815,2.6962,4.0879,1.0053,5.7029,0.3729,4.4635,4.0976,2.9744,1.8468,0.3577,0.6719,2.4673,3.5308,3.3595,4.026,1.4761,6.5649,1.4224,0.4246,3.0026,2.6689,2.4359,1.7558,0.1512,0.4735,5.3525,3.1937,18.5407,7.4275,1.6224,2.4792,0.4021,0.5573,2.1766,1.7066,6.1882,2.314,0.627,1.3648,5.7989,4.1845,4.8269,2.3813,2.2066,5.9577,2.7743,1.3316,0.432,4.425,3.3365,7.2796,4.8219,2.2928,0.0673,0.4602,1.4091,2.0246,4.8219,4.142,0.813,4.4421,0.144,0.1621,3.0844,4.5452,2.4342,5.2091,4.0741,1.3437,2.6826,1.2103,1.6609,6.924,4.9279,0.47,3.2188,2.5411,1.2566,2.193,3.7074,1.8427,0.5742,6.0358,0.415,0.44,1.7867,6.2524,3.1785,2.6903,0.3492,2.9232,2.9095,1.0738,0.5821,0.0014,1.9192,0.7882,0.5934,0.6014,4.9764,2.935,6.7822,4.8169,6.6422,0.0037,2.4967,7.7577,1.8135,3.6391,2.8275,3.2621,4.5438,0.0378,5.1205,3.3739,7.129,8.5375,1.482,8.4777,3.8174,0.987,5.2041,0.1099,0.7654,0.9864,5.3772,3.8456,0.0008,1.6885,0.0028,0.0,0.8097,1.1041,4.2765,0.0027,1.6585,2.5959,1.5671,0.2892,1.3161,1.8791,2.4495,2.4422,1.3569,11.8416,5.3468,7.2465,3.0403,3.1291,0.3735,5.7311,1.6067,0.2414,1.8231,5.1693,6.9968,3.6593,2.7911,6.556,3.9922,0.5935,5.6115,3.7823,4.698,3.5835,4.8935,4.4815,3.4175,4.3125,7.7946,5.647,3.5354,0.0165,0.8984,2.938,5.199,0.1696,0.4695,3.1912,0.6191,7.5189,6.3177]}

Last year, prosecutors had filed an action against the Anerkesamt against the Berlin-based Centre for Cultural Freedom in the belief that it had \"attempted to radicalise youth\" and that it was \"part of a wider process of radicalization of children and youths\".\nIt is the latest effort to curb the activities of leftist and Islamist groups in the capital amid a clampdown on political activity aimed at curbing the reach of populist parties.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office in Berlin has filed an official complaint against the Centre for Cultural Freedom, calling it an extremist group.\nThe decision to withdraw the complaint and not prosecute two out of the four lawmakers who had filed complaints against the Anerkesamt did not come as a surprise.\nIn his speech when announcing the ban, prosecutor Thomas Bockert cited a letter that the centre received in 2014 which gave reason to believe that the association may have been engaged in terrorist offenses.\nThe Anerkesamt has come under fire since declaring in January that it no longer regards the Left Party as extremist.\nIn April, the prosecutor\u2019s office decided to take a look at a group that had published an Islamist manifesto and was accused of inciting hatred against Muslims.","token_len":286,"entropy":[8.0872,4.4866,4.1508,1.6368,9.9971,0.578,2.2564,8.7064,0.1585,5.7786,5.9421,8.361,6.0914,0.0371,5.8981,1.2025,5.0672,2.8108,2.5648,2.2922,10.4324,1.3627,1.0432,4.9552,5.0679,6.572,5.731,0.1958,0.6142,1.9042,1.8061,0.6813,3.5167,0.4216,8.9309,1.5728,0.3808,5.0923,2.8529,4.6028,2.4453,4.6916,0.4796,1.2785,6.3615,7.9184,8.9124,7.6374,6.4432,10.2201,1.4698,6.9609,1.5967,0.0164,6.6041,0.3366,6.3073,2.9542,3.426,1.6859,8.1109,0.2354,1.0613,1.2511,3.011,5.051,0.5021,0.0069,0.0688,7.1867,1.6827,3.0388,2.6134,1.4155,1.8816,1.5055,1.5829,1.4763,4.7399,0.2706,0.6975,2.0541,7.2993,1.0731,2.4889,1.5939,2.2974,3.9923,2.5624,3.2969,1.2964,0.6422,15.9369,1.7023,1.7433,2.3008,4.5338,1.624,3.5869,1.3703,2.9078,0.0569,6.3686,3.3624,2.3943,0.5452,1.3626,2.1658,4.1979,5.0453,1.9376,5.3166,0.0421,0.2824,3.4566,1.7448,5.8022,0.0133,1.8307,0.0518,1.6549,6.369,0.0421,6.4269,1.9796,0.9401,0.5968,1.5515,6.3408,16.836,8.9467,0.4602,0.8723,2.0836,0.904,3.0615,4.6252,1.4278,4.0034,0.1284,0.7703,0.8929,2.4292,0.3739,0.052,0.0002,1.0395,4.5635,0.348,1.7564,4.3159,1.4894,1.7332,0.8528,1.5287,4.792,1.4006,2.2902,0.3522,1.1468,4.3215,4.7656,2.5338,6.5781,8.3131,0.0184,1.214,2.1714,7.9051,2.9748,2.0836,4.2198,4.0009,1.4721,0.7195,3.7433,0.0041,0.0064,0.0038,0.0021,5.6432,0.027,1.7216,0.5305,0.0552,0.1793,1.0729,0.903,3.0019,3.6489,4.2088,7.3718,3.5724,0.3279,2.2772,0.7068,3.9102,4.0761,4.0037,3.963,3.3063,5.9661,1.9376,4.8431,3.5224,2.0473,2.6959,3.4305,3.438,3.6347,4.0031,5.5292,6.4719,1.2657,1.4753,0.409,1.1046,3.4985,4.8497,0.5692,1.4909,5.1908,0.0364,3.6654,9.6351,0.4079,0.4392,1.9613,3.4105,0.0035,0.002,0.0042,0.0019,2.3492,5.7571,0.0296,1.9152,3.0958,7.6376,3.4613,2.8468,0.6145,0.3755,5.7852,0.0001,7.178,1.8291,5.991,1.7598,0.4651,5.8171,0.782,0.8866,2.9065,4.0117,0.3134,1.074,5.8766,4.1884,0.0635,0.0069,0.0226,5.0641,0.4332,3.4878,1.874,4.7729,0.1427,2.7283,3.1236,2.2921,1.2375,5.1147,1.9024,5.0932,2.0223,2.3595,3.5555,2.5329,0.1817,3.1439,2.5214,0.9268,1.2384,0.5965]}

Ryan (R-Wis.), who had a woman on the other side of the table with his spouse and had the wife removed.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to censor the testimony of two of her female staffers after they reported what they thought were misogynistic remarks and inappropriate behavior by a male staffer.\nOther allegations, including Ryan\u2019s, have been swept aside, even when corroborated, as unfounded or otherwise unprovable.\nWhile sex-baiting and offensive jokes may be acceptable in personal life, such conduct is prohibited by law as a form of harassment.\nThe National Coalition on Women and Politics recently released a report warning of a resurgence of sexual harassment on the House floor in the runup to the 2018 elections and advising lawmakers about how to handle such complaints. The report cites the growing number of women elected into key committee chairs and increasing public awareness as positive developments that will help prevent future abuse.","token_len":286,"entropy":[12.3317,0.0043,5.2672,3.6805,2.8969,0.8106,6.1832,0.3695,0.0095,0.0125,5.0135,1.7768,3.5171,4.638,2.8208,6.7926,4.7531,6.8475,2.7397,1.0808,5.2363,3.8235,3.9146,1.018,0.1456,3.5547,6.6177,1.0972,4.3726,0.5249,2.3393,2.7051,5.5911,1.9158,3.9325,10.2954,0.9021,1.3602,0.9606,7.207,0.0734,0.1994,0.3457,18.2524,2.2655,2.2459,0.0022,6.4443,5.9117,0.0047,0.0,3.6117,1.3405,1.3591,1.4247,5.3901,3.211,1.7028,1.2808,2.3999,3.5628,2.9348,1.8558,5.5103,7.9812,2.7292,2.1835,5.3249,0.041,6.1967,2.4249,3.2509,4.1595,1.9838,2.8349,3.3545,1.8976,2.4304,1.0065,0.8926,8.9606,1.5375,0.5879,1.7052,5.9531,2.6048,2.7295,3.5039,2.9209,4.3927,1.0607,0.6888,0.9711,0.0014,0.0005,0.5359,0.0281,0.0301,0.0201,0.0107,0.7411,0.9369,3.3109,1.9303,6.1247,4.0642,1.8123,6.2979,0.7359,0.1235,0.4571,3.508,4.1195,5.3825,6.6112,2.3927,3.252,4.2238,5.1385,7.8213,3.687,1.0038,10.2957,1.8237,0.0962,0.004,0.0021,0.0985,0.0257,0.0032,0.0012,0.3063,5.7144,0.1889,8.6577,1.3909,5.505,0.8975,3.4182,2.4325,0.8323,3.0657,2.9294,3.1775,1.4174,4.1096,4.7126,1.3573,3.1116,1.1225,7.258,0.0548,1.4616,3.9601,2.6617,1.2326,2.0816,2.451,3.162,1.6124,0.863,0.5529,6.1635,3.6386,3.3028,1.0592,7.0626,14.999,10.7275,2.7391,2.6202,2.2217,1.5665,6.7903,5.4188,2.6336,4.4935,3.8086,5.8255,0.3944,2.2211,2.5815,6.9641,2.2693,3.8159,3.9081,3.7514,2.1884,0.3183,0.4159,4.9319,6.6707,2.1044,8.4577,0.0146,3.1229,6.2965,5.2614,3.4539,1.394,4.5094,1.3007,6.8967,3.0708,0.1974,3.6224,2.8147,1.6957,4.5195,1.4165,0.9598,4.7331,1.2171,2.3804,0.0015,1.3003,1.2267,0.7336,2.355,4.1684,2.9436,1.9777,2.4732,2.2323,5.7004,4.4786,1.3172,0.4981,0.8166,5.797,1.8783,1.8313,6.2236,0.3186,1.4775,0.6923,3.428,2.4369,2.4476,0.3731,2.9376,1.026,4.7525,3.7794,0.0018,0.5048,1.3302,1.2231,3.4343,6.9392,2.0365,3.1505,1.4521,0.1859,2.9187,1.7996,3.6679,0.2308,2.817,1.2131,4.6769,2.4884,3.9758,1.0217,0.0142,2.189,6.4939,5.4413,5.3286,7.0028,4.9607,1.3993,8.0932,4.1584,1.5321,5.5664,7.4159,3.56,4.0427,2.6633,1.6315,3.6328,1.9521,3.4942,0.5574]}

The","text":"The U.S. federal government is working on a long-term plan to help Puerto Rico rebuild after Hurricane Maria tore through the island territory three weeks ago, an administration official said on Wednesday. The plan is similar to a $2 trillion economic bailout the federal government enacted in 2008 and 2010 following the 2008 recession to rescue large financial institutions. The plan released Wednesday is meant to supplement long-term recovery efforts in key sectors such as construction and telecommunications, the official said. It is being worked out over the next few months by U.S. officials, including officials within Puerto Rico\u2019s government and U.S. Agency for International Development officials, the official said. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development would oversee the effort along with other federal agencies and Puerto Rico officials, though it\u2019s unclear how many federal workers would be tasked to work with Puerto Rico. \u201cThe plan will be developed over a several months period and will require the collaboration of federal and Puerto Rico officials,\u201d the official said, adding such details were still being worked out.

On January 20, 2021, members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) will take a key poll on whether the RNC will support such a strategy when the Republican legislative caucus takes a poll on its own.\nAlthough the RNC poll seems to have a lot of importance, it is worth mentioning that it is expected to have less legitimacy than the more important presidential race. Therefore, it is only meaningful to highlight the possibility of such a move, but it is possible to ask whether it will still be a success or a failure.\nIn 2017, the RNC adopted the plan of taking a poll on the question whether the party wants to repeal and replace or leave Obamacare in its current form. Although several polls in different states have confirmed that most Republican voters supported the plan to leave Obamacare, when the time for the actual legislative push came up the Republicans in the Senate did not push to have the bill removed, instead acting as a buffer against any move.","token_len":287,"entropy":[9.4253,4.4425,0.1106,3.1801,1.369,0.0302,0.471,5.6811,0.2995,1.2543,0.1239,1.4299,8.4992,1.7596,16.7623,7.1448,5.4952,1.6869,0.0068,7.1023,8.7658,5.0393,1.9318,6.3712,5.2287,6.7674,4.7398,3.9315,2.4141,5.5885,1.5037,5.5715,0.7254,8.51,2.4773,4.8505,2.0501,1.3221,2.1012,1.9129,4.8431,0.4895,2.8875,0.374,5.9051,1.7193,6.8751,2.2188,1.3716,2.3636,11.0842,8.1921,4.3763,4.3088,1.2487,1.8689,0.0288,0.1776,0.6352,3.7814,0.4801,3.0399,19.0249,3.6265,0.8492,4.4512,0.2508,1.0508,0.7137,0.0279,0.6944,1.1454,5.7401,9.9877,0.9853,10.2985,0.0002,4.1553,6.6092,2.2911,1.0344,5.6218,5.2603,3.7705,3.3399,3.5641,0.1297,1.262,1.4285,1.6087,7.5649,0.6378,2.4263,6.2714,2.5123,1.7279,6.5573,4.1729,2.4464,0.8069,8.6189,0.134,6.4796,0.0889,0.7753,3.2548,1.706,0.0482,2.8152,0.0977,0.0064,0.084,0.8309,4.2778,2.0605,6.3169,8.579,1.6121,1.8048,2.2155,5.5553,1.1376,2.3323,5.9679,0.2416,5.5189,5.446,1.7894,3.2808,6.4663,3.7649,4.4607,1.8646,6.5022,0.9284,4.2517,2.0986,1.0648,1.2717,7.9547,1.2772,1.3901,5.0845,5.4656,0.5905,2.722,2.5196,3.4002,0.2392,7.3165,0.748,1.276,1.5814,5.1134,3.0251,0.2794,2.2793,1.2084,6.2579,0.2464,2.5904,5.1124,9.0456,0.3544,0.8789,6.009,4.3862,5.7367,4.0997,1.6713,5.8317,0.1003,1.596,0.7091,4.9245,7.4615,1.8736,4.8101,1.0141,4.5688,1.0372,3.1496,0.2409,3.2693,2.4547,3.4712,1.5015,0.8509,2.9674,3.0309,5.4387,2.4005,1.938,2.1841,6.1762,1.0275,2.1501,4.5977,2.9729,2.2777,0.0949,0.5029,0.7048,3.1375,5.2352,0.0914,1.3802,1.7676,8.2674,2.0693,3.6949,2.3109,5.6534,0.7853,0.9225,0.3921,1.4133,4.9492,3.1658,1.2176,2.6677,4.9851,0.2233,1.052,0.2762,0.0111,6.9864,7.1158,2.906,2.8354,4.6719,0.4501,0.0485,0.2568,4.3927,6.3826,2.6524,3.6989,6.4862,1.1668,0.987,5.1049,1.0677,5.4866,2.436,0.7214,5.523,1.1067,0.8584,4.5005,4.1403,0.8206,0.8226,6.1951,2.0914,6.2129,4.6924,1.9969,5.3097,4.6543,4.7567,1.2827,4.989,3.8931,4.762,3.4286,1.8943,1.6278,3.738,0.1579,5.8893,3.0776,4.8462,1.1934,2.6725,3.4933,3.0834,3.5833,5.2667,1.2094,1.8273,6.2696,2.8361,2.5606,5.1891,2.5117]}

{"prompt":"A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013 , has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trump \u2019 s eldest son","text":"A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013, has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trump \u2019 s eldest son, whom he introduced to his business partners in Russia.\nThis is how the story is told in the Washington Post as an analysis of two congressional subpoenas ( one for information and one for documents ), issued on April 9, demanding records of communications between Trump associates and Russian officials and an ex-Russian spy. After Trump was nominated to the U. S. presidency on January 20, Donald Rumsfeld warned that Russia tried to influence the candidate \u2019 s victory through a hacking campaign and social media use, which he called the Russian-Trump conspiracy.\nIn March, Trump appointed retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who served during the Bush administration, as his national security adviser. Flynn replaced Roger Stone, a political adviser to Trump \u2019 s campaign, after he resigned in disgrace, although Trump had previously said that Stone would soon return.

Nazarbayev, who wields sweeping powers in the oil-rich nation\u2019s economy, described the cash losses as \u201cillegal\u201d. It is unclear where or when the money was found but Nazarbayev\u2019s comments are a rare public reminder that the issue has sparked major debate. The issue has been a source of tension in Kazakhstan since the global financial crisis, but has only begun to emerge as a focal point of the political debate after being brought back into the spotlight in the run-up to the presidential elections in March, which Nazarbayev won easily. The country\u2019s economy has seen weak growth in recent years and Nazarbayev has recently called for reforms aimed at stimulating domestic consumption. In the past he has also threatened to hold \u201cclean-up operations\u201d on the state bureaucracy, which has been accused of looting the nation\u2019s coffers. In the past few years both local and international law firms have also emerged as hotbeds for illicit cash transfers and Nazarbayev has criticised them for that. Mr Nazarbayev met with top executives from KazMunaiGaz, TransKazakhstan and TransUrals on Wednesday and also discussed with them the issue of corruption and the whereabouts of the funds.","token_len":293,"entropy":[7.9462,2.5953,9.5282,3.9222,0.0075,0.0411,0.007,0.0003,0.0092,8.6314,2.5076,2.2028,0.6041,5.3253,2.8295,3.1985,0.8164,2.3659,3.0266,0.0416,4.7987,8.3045,8.0342,7.5021,8.2189,3.3209,4.2488,7.988,2.1886,0.5781,5.5616,0.0098,0.0004,0.0013,1.7033,0.7465,8.3602,0.0033,6.8269,0.6314,1.59,1.286,5.8253,1.004,0.2259,2.6661,15.7216,7.0432,3.719,3.2459,0.1096,6.3725,0.9277,8.4002,8.2432,0.2435,14.3299,5.0654,5.3133,3.3748,8.0401,1.5062,5.7323,1.1878,2.4511,4.1445,4.0097,1.4031,1.1504,2.223,2.393,5.0845,3.813,4.6946,0.0029,0.0003,0.0012,6.8554,0.1441,0.0091,4.3192,2.7398,3.8458,4.6906,3.7403,6.4902,1.0715,1.8608,7.2041,2.2725,6.351,5.7137,3.1215,1.7322,2.9527,5.1249,1.3455,1.6376,2.6281,2.9116,0.0116,2.8766,1.3544,3.0295,1.6882,1.4452,7.4048,0.9645,0.052,2.1886,3.5878,2.6384,4.5292,5.112,0.1126,3.7573,1.9846,0.4702,4.1156,0.0327,1.3737,1.6183,2.3041,1.5187,3.2845,5.6717,3.4351,4.482,1.9314,0.7975,0.9232,1.5129,1.8954,3.2113,0.3364,0.0012,0.001,0.4347,3.2335,1.1166,1.0123,2.5517,3.1296,3.2906,6.4381,0.0052,0.0003,0.001,1.2022,5.5516,0.3525,2.3238,3.1644,4.6525,0.2687,0.0018,2.1059,1.4543,3.6704,6.2865,0.4144,1.91,0.7861,0.4459,1.2689,4.0839,0.0024,0.0004,0.0009,1.4905,5.3774,4.2542,0.336,3.4977,3.8749,0.006,6.1465,4.3513,3.6433,0.8985,3.2306,2.2151,1.8286,4.4391,0.2853,3.1702,3.8861,0.2696,4.9241,13.8623,0.0695,8.5701,2.3207,0.2236,1.4775,0.5196,4.8074,3.6378,1.4202,3.3933,9.0159,2.1335,2.0925,1.7839,1.2181,2.5916,0.0869,6.4987,2.6495,3.7638,1.0335,0.0264,0.0059,2.4358,0.6258,2.9501,2.045,1.4597,2.0099,2.0362,6.4096,8.2482,0.3973,2.3041,5.3876,4.034,0.2202,3.5192,5.2645,0.4661,6.1996,0.2993,0.0358,1.207,3.6284,2.593,3.3252,2.7339,7.7617,0.0015,0.0003,0.0013,0.9678,6.6979,2.5883,0.944,7.0498,0.4509,7.1151,2.2903,0.0062,0.0005,0.0013,7.4531,0.7866,4.0602,3.5881,1.5048,6.8758,8.3641,3.6337,5.1143,9.4517,1.2069,2.4589,7.5415,4.953,0.0125,2.7573,3.1036,1.3748,2.3985,10.1379,3.4545,2.8118,0.9289,1.9496,4.6923,3.2256,4.1845,1.6167,0.9882,2.4247,0.3702,3.5983,1.6658,2.0632,9.1065,0.0275,1.6613,3.2759,0.8675]}

Ms Szydlo emphasized that this did not mean that the EU had decided to apply the Articles of the European Union Treaties of Lisbon which contain the mechanism for initiating a procedure of Article 7. She said that this mechanism was invoked only in cases where the EU considers that the third country breaches the Copenhagen criteria. The Copenhagen criteria are a set of standards adopted by the EU to determine to which countries membership may be granted.\nWe are not talking about Article 7 anymore, but about the European Commission to decide about whether or not it adheres to these criteria, President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz said.\nThe Polish government announced in June that it was rejecting an agreement on migration control between the EU and Turkey. The deal was reached after the EU agreed to help Turkey curb illegal immigration. According to an agreement signed in January last year, Turkey agreed to implement three measures on its shores. To prevent illegal emigration, it was required to build a fence and a barbed-wire fence along the Turkish border with Greece. The agreement stated that Turkey must also set up centres for refugees from which arrivals from Greece were admitted. Turkish law also prohibits the return on its territory of anyone found to have crossed the Syrian border illegally.","token_len":295,"entropy":[8.1703,1.7011,11.3555,5.6217,1.0551,5.1144,1.7741,5.1046,0.0702,0.0004,6.4903,5.047,4.8325,4.7863,4.3213,4.9159,1.7579,5.168,0.0333,6.0785,6.3109,4.0686,0.0471,2.7422,11.5521,1.2287,2.2192,8.9795,5.4602,0.5697,5.6868,2.4807,0.0252,0.0025,1.675,19.7153,0.0036,2.669,0.3237,1.781,6.2436,0.0739,0.0004,0.1995,0.6473,0.4888,0.7367,1.2604,5.7164,0.3821,0.0097,0.0011,6.7126,0.2749,4.0576,4.3092,0.0151,0.6112,0.6139,1.1378,1.7523,2.4775,2.7424,0.3236,5.2577,1.3678,5.7596,1.7591,2.8106,1.3424,0.4243,10.5856,0.006,5.3634,7.7332,5.8872,5.9863,1.3183,7.077,0.8743,7.2541,2.1505,3.7649,4.2736,4.4206,0.1088,0.9823,2.7171,0.9622,0.8022,3.1876,6.6102,1.3225,6.8567,2.6445,2.0257,1.6487,0.798,1.2516,2.4089,4.788,0.939,1.294,7.9406,0.7202,8.7451,1.1002,9.7414,5.7431,1.0856,2.3555,8.6307,0.5767,2.0505,2.8644,2.407,0.0165,3.7503,4.0938,0.2999,0.4017,1.869,1.6729,4.2997,6.1243,1.2706,2.5641,6.5625,5.2817,0.3971,3.8371,0.9264,2.7166,11.9554,2.4549,2.2454,3.5483,0.222,3.7652,0.2717,6.2607,1.6764,1.9998,4.2669,1.4647,3.299,1.3669,5.7564,3.0718,4.3265,3.1058,1.8138,0.0065,2.6635,7.8963,0.0754,0.049,2.6954,0.9692,2.0081,8.2765,1.3311,0.1754,0.3647,1.3783,4.4734,0.0107,0.0,0.7279,1.0055,1.7601,2.1363,3.3284,2.1459,5.2235,2.7845,2.9047,0.2814,0.4023,1.9769,5.1345,3.3695,3.8746,2.9877,4.1097,6.7206,2.6888,1.2734,0.777,0.1931,4.422,1.7338,1.3803,3.6096,1.6965,2.6398,1.5691,2.0239,1.9116,3.4453,0.4342,5.4433,1.0087,5.7696,3.3008,1.2793,1.5693,4.4866,0.0016,4.4758,2.7227,1.3135,1.3478,3.4388,3.8267,0.0352,0.4349,1.4721,3.0689,0.1271,4.0769,5.906,1.3563,3.5859,2.7158,5.9972,2.1176,6.4489,2.9492,2.4406,7.0816,0.046,0.8158,3.0094,3.5989,3.2045,0.3479,4.2749,0.946,1.5292,2.4914,4.0997,6.7347,0.4672,2.165,0.0001,0.1391,2.1276,1.0485,1.7741,0.3677,2.8216,2.0077,0.6413,1.6669,2.377,5.9466,0.1737,1.7803,2.8182,2.8876,4.6334,0.2324,8.0679,1.7822,3.0163,2.9487,8.2386,7.8133,2.8249,3.1779,5.1138,4.5327,0.7111,4.8054,5.7111,2.7494,2.5502,1.582,4.031,7.7294,5.7545,0.8926,0.2665,4.0325,3.5677,0.6227,1.2061,4.1024,0.6638,4.1212,0.3595,1.4723,0.5179]}

But the growing public outcry over the steep cuts in Social Security and other benefits for the elderly - in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold a law exempting the elderly from its age limit - and the recent economic data that showed a shrinking economy had cast doubt.\nSenators Joe Manchin, Mitt Romney and Mitt Romney in a Senate Judiciary hearing on the question of whether the bill would be uphold by the U.S. Supreme Court.

He has also repeatedly tried to shore up support for his bid by promising that he will stay in power through to 2020.\n\u201cIn the time coming, I hope the people in Venezuela give their opinion. I hope the will of the people prevails.\u201d Maduro said in a speech to workers of the Pension Fund, one of the pillars of support for the regime.\nThis is not true! The people in Venezuela need to vote at this time. Maduro knows he is not reelected due to the fact that if the government lost they would be impeached and the military would have the authority to overthrow him. The military is very opposed to Maduro so he has no choice but to step down in 2018. If his term in office continues you can bet those members of his base who are receiving government benefits will receive the same benefits with the addition that they will receive more money when they sell their benefits. This has already come to fruition as military members have taken over the running of the oil industry which is the lifeblood of the nation.","token_len":296,"entropy":[12.2028,0.1386,9.6698,12.386,0.4046,4.287,1.8789,2.1584,0.6221,1.7212,4.607,8.2772,0.0027,0.9531,1.7124,3.2352,0.3916,0.007,2.2683,0.3481,1.6555,2.0999,1.885,3.5993,9.1636,0.0099,1.2934,0.1877,0.3181,1.3672,5.5882,2.4963,3.7851,4.6839,0.8209,3.9316,0.1638,5.6469,2.3066,5.4532,4.0641,1.5849,4.0851,18.0627,8.794,1.2911,2.3723,0.4644,3.5766,0.2173,1.0592,0.0047,0.3749,0.2095,0.3581,20.1052,0.0003,1.5849,1.0627,1.3488,1.5263,1.8094,3.6288,4.6748,0.405,2.9361,2.802,7.6547,4.1714,1.1183,4.461,0.13,1.1927,2.6424,4.6502,4.4669,3.8464,2.6807,1.2914,2.4623,3.0298,0.849,7.5016,2.6678,0.9294,2.8439,0.8913,1.9147,2.8603,5.0531,0.0478,5.6163,0.0085,0.8156,0.5406,0.7383,5.1532,1.6632,3.255,2.9548,1.0406,2.4808,4.5092,0.3632,0.5309,3.5185,7.1554,1.3696,0.69,0.2845,5.8093,5.9884,6.1616,2.1422,7.2712,7.4586,0.1359,5.9497,1.881,2.9644,3.8872,2.9648,0.4305,7.6093,2.5196,4.6876,2.9673,2.4532,0.909,2.1995,6.4873,0.2312,0.2686,0.2479,6.1864,0.0015,0.9176,2.8374,6.991,7.2663,2.382,1.4213,0.5615,1.3159,1.8105,6.0508,4.4667,1.0349,9.3384,3.8442,3.0535,3.9316,0.0144,0.5074,7.5204,0.034,6.6084,0.2743,1.5835,6.5839,2.2468,0.5796,5.2482,1.5788,1.6527,6.6324,5.1016,2.4518,1.8585,1.7453,0.0843,4.7946,1.3817,3.4179,5.8389,3.1676,1.3409,1.2141,5.7476,7.1002,2.7356,1.8712,1.9665,6.2222,3.21,5.8075,0.012,1.7304,3.9921,0.1289,5.3202,3.0437,2.7279,6.8298,5.3495,0.4606,1.7429,5.5556,0.001,1.6063,2.2227,4.7457,0.5593,2.8634,3.1605,4.1224,0.0792,4.8026,0.7566,0.2886,2.761,4.1691,1.8747,4.8045,8.0696,0.0543,3.1397,4.8668,1.7164,1.8506,3.5184,0.8183,0.125,0.0212,3.436,0.5134,3.7856,2.4337,0.539,3.7553,3.9106,4.6354,3.7659,0.172,3.9531,7.9735,2.1012,2.1296,6.4045,5.863,0.1515,2.2772,4.3563,2.1213,1.7615,8.567,5.7522,2.2479,1.0169,6.5465,3.3947,0.8064,1.4725,5.8296,1.9136,6.9985,2.3918,1.3885,0.7696,2.0145,4.0255,2.6975,4.7056,0.7992,6.7577,0.7116,7.1696,0.8187,2.8418,3.8851,2.8228,6.4138,0.5679,2.755,3.5186,6.4909,2.915,1.8087,3.9597,2.481,1.1925,8.3861,0.1858,0.8052,4.6249,1.9806,3.9846,1.3731,2.6723,6.0686,0.0066,0.0842,0.8806,3.5922,0.3479]}

Many also suffered heavy damage and heavy rain has filled sewers and flooded homes, streets and roads. In addition, power cuts have impacted residents, many in the midst of trying to recover from a yearlong drought which left residents without water and heat for many months. The devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian caused the most damage in Hurricane history. The storm has been labeled as the second-ranked hurricane on the historical scale of the most powerful hurricanes that hit the United States. Although it did not directly hit the island, it caused widespread devastation in the U.S. Southern region. The storm left millions homeless but killed an estimated eight people.","token_len":296,"entropy":[11.2465,1.2331,2.161,3.6413,0.1813,3.2306,0.1501,3.5433,0.0005,0.0063,0.0038,0.4832,0.2753,3.4669,1.4865,2.3916,2.0146,0.0118,2.8898,2.4916,0.0725,6.6038,0.9599,6.2111,5.6594,1.7179,2.6947,5.2843,2.8486,7.369,0.1245,1.633,7.2853,0.0978,0.2374,0.0002,0.6092,0.0009,0.3942,4.9718,1.1891,2.2991,2.8955,3.3568,4.8905,1.1398,2.4648,0.5903,1.3283,6.603,3.9383,1.5541,3.2186,4.9141,4.8203,0.6826,0.0196,3.4116,4.4845,1.2293,0.0345,0.4577,5.8329,0.9384,3.5469,0.5462,2.4205,1.1072,1.4097,4.2453,6.0014,1.087,0.6551,3.4648,4.1517,4.3273,2.3328,12.5223,8.0892,7.5573,1.2933,0.7548,4.1108,2.7316,2.3624,2.7926,6.7908,7.8428,4.4365,0.7285,4.7088,1.008,4.0157,4.1965,4.7331,7.2487,1.1604,0.4764,0.3341,4.3723,0.6101,1.9596,5.2692,0.001,0.0118,0.0453,1.9159,2.9386,0.6205,0.0612,7.5704,2.0468,5.6034,1.8784,5.114,0.5706,1.7948,5.1748,0.4109,0.2897,1.4133,1.3624,1.5482,2.8455,3.6311,2.2626,2.5497,0.3161,0.2739,3.0384,2.9251,0.0005,0.0075,0.0034,3.8932,1.9306,4.5702,0.864,2.8809,3.4336,4.2552,0.5108,1.7403,3.588,1.1993,1.8418,3.8073,2.9749,0.0007,0.1248,6.3112,0.7456,0.1639,5.8311,2.3812,1.8532,4.5739,8.1659,0.0005,2.0034,3.9783,3.692,3.45,5.7162,3.2135,4.9478,2.2954,4.3472,5.6503,2.715,3.3261,0.9316,2.4731,5.635,3.5819,8.9718,7.4237,9.0194,0.0037,1.3182,1.563,2.8595,1.8683,9.3685,0.3404,3.5293,0.4875,3.4923,2.6648,0.3752,4.7722,4.7104,0.965,4.8229,3.962,2.0794,3.994,3.271,1.6305,4.8712,0.0017,6.333,0.0219,3.0442,0.3478,3.0523,6.2632,2.7349,1.6752,6.1436,3.8786,4.0194,0.4717,3.1177,1.4884,5.6038,2.3325,4.0368,1.5832,0.1299,2.2962,4.4657,2.525,0.3466,0.7344,12.9571,4.3568,4.0649,3.0858,5.0314,1.2861,0.9514,6.3076,10.9361,1.3869,2.0423,3.3168,2.6646,2.997,7.1373,2.2889,0.9996,4.4019,0.5035,10.0117,0.8437,2.1652,0.4515,10.464,3.8826,2.2411,0.9387,5.3863,2.0211,2.4682,4.0729,1.5482,0.3174,2.0735,0.0021,1.373,5.3525,2.5771,4.1359,0.4214,4.1629,1.1505,0.9113,2.6113,0.6478,1.0378,2.9038,2.5655,1.8561,1.5325,1.4521,3.9372,0.0009,0.0025,0.4369,6.0639,3.8739,1.0037,1.914,2.1325,3.9966,5.231,1.8538,6.612,6.4141,3.7535,0.0498,6.2875,4.9976,0.9743]}

The change comes days after Scaramucci delivered a wildly offensive speech at a White House event marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nScaramucci said he was surprised to have been placed in the role and said the president had made an ill-advised decision in naming him.\nHe said that Trump had promised him a big promotion, something he had been waiting for for many years. Then, it came out that it was an appointment as a senior adviser. He said on Monday that he had told Trump that he doesn\u2019t think that is what this job entails.\nThe president was forced to respond to the news on Monday night, saying, \u201cAnthony\u2019s never been my enemy, but he\u2019s my friend as well.

This decision is condemned and decried, it said in a statement, which was carried by the Iraqi official news agency in a copy accessed by AFP.\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump s planned move Wednesday to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital came as world leaders began to express their unhappiness with the move.\nIraq s Senior Shi ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the move on Thursday, saying it was another violation of Islamic teaching and of international law.\nGrand Ayatollah al-Sistani condemned the announcement at a meeting with the leaders of the United States Christian community in Najaf, the capital of the vast province of the same name, one of the most conservative Islamist areas in the Middle East and a stronghold of the Shi ite group that was a longtime enemy of both Saddam s Baath regime and Iran s Islamic Revolution.\nFor the U.S. and its allies, it was a strategic move that will pave the way for a diplomatic and political solution to the Israeli- Palestinian conflicts, which has plagued the region for decades.\nWashington has promised Israel the release of several Israeli prisoners in exchange for this decision. The timing of the announcement coincides with Trump s visit, and it makes it harder for Israel to stop it.","token_len":296,"entropy":[8.2629,10.8156,9.1959,3.2454,12.2082,3.2857,5.5828,9.4697,0.5644,0.2882,0.0079,1.8245,1.838,0.1385,0.6565,0.0465,5.5249,4.5272,2.5363,6.6494,0.0403,0.0687,0.1928,1.3292,0.2471,0.0045,9.2708,2.9757,0.1513,3.6426,0.3117,0.0517,0.5108,3.5189,0.0215,0.7836,6.6023,3.5225,2.2366,6.1312,5.2371,8.2336,0.2287,4.7633,4.4678,2.5414,2.2187,0.1569,0.2113,2.5914,3.4696,1.4836,5.0896,0.5379,1.0727,5.3508,5.1663,2.9375,0.0368,5.207,2.3106,5.1735,7.2449,0.3607,2.3353,0.3309,1.3793,18.6229,1.7403,1.9975,0.0008,0.0054,0.03,0.4384,0.0142,0.0228,3.2967,7.8965,1.6541,5.8903,0.2878,0.2855,0.1273,0.0705,0.4038,0.23,0.0228,8.3983,1.3883,6.8844,1.0167,4.7091,1.3493,3.7588,0.7247,5.6794,0.0011,1.46,0.9526,2.5353,0.7282,0.187,20.5471,3.2967,5.098,3.0263,2.1783,0.0079,0.0599,0.1005,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,0.0072,0.0021,0.0014,0.0007,0.0058,0.2385,3.6957,1.0266,1.1798,0.4285,1.3743,1.0868,1.6766,1.2324,6.5689,4.9858,0.0421,3.5944,7.3473,1.4779,3.7601,2.0397,0.1049,0.3426,0.2481,13.9733,0.0434,0.0012,0.0015,2.3708,0.0301,0.0165,0.0072,3.9458,0.6861,3.9844,3.9697,0.3482,1.3963,1.6834,2.8273,2.3681,0.07,1.2783,2.8681,0.4819,10.4219,3.5837,1.0822,8.1066,0.0259,1.1544,2.7145,1.2914,0.1911,1.5443,7.2421,3.9805,0.3082,4.521,6.1939,0.0067,1.0316,6.9488,0.4954,0.5108,2.4078,3.0646,6.8876,4.4084,0.7534,0.9761,2.1793,0.0076,3.001,1.7569,1.6897,0.1541,1.5176,2.5823,4.2476,0.0223,4.2771,3.2747,4.9345,4.3497,4.7553,2.2062,0.1141,4.547,4.2466,4.6475,4.2188,0.6936,1.4371,0.1432,1.993,1.8796,2.9374,1.9118,1.2155,0.0992,6.6278,1.6072,3.5703,0.0028,0.0105,1.0826,2.0953,1.2229,0.5827,0.7871,2.619,1.4692,1.0736,6.5787,0.5841,1.4778,3.6216,4.7697,0.0197,0.0054,0.0947,1.6995,4.2492,2.2337,2.0154,1.5267,0.5889,0.3405,3.5218,0.0998,10.4133,6.3957,1.4748,2.353,3.8554,4.9397,0.75,0.7237,0.7108,1.0279,0.354,0.1547,4.35,1.7338,6.2489,5.4663,3.8601,5.2664,0.0243,4.813,2.9908,0.7501,2.4689,1.7276,0.0047,6.6699,5.1398,1.0419,2.8314,6.3846,0.4925,0.4092,0.8998,5.6058,0.0395,3.426,0.8351,4.0697,3.0084,2.7169,2.2362,5.886,0.9921,2.7859,0.3831,2.6092,0.2032,5.7653,3.9612,1.499]}

The department said this was part of a $1.8 trillion annual budget. This included $ 2.4 billion in sales for the Middle East and North Africa, including the sale of advanced sensors for Morocco's new naval vessels to a $ 11.4 million total. This was announced in a press release from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which said the contract with the Moroccan government was part of the U.S. military\u2019s global initiative to create the Marine Corps as a major force in the 21st century, which included the development of modern naval vessels. It will allow the Moroccan Navy and Coast Guard in addition to improving surveillance in water areas and improving maritime security to prevent ship theft. The contract was awarded in March 2017 and it comes into force on July 2, 2017, one day earlier. The agreement between the U.S. and Morocco was announced less than four month after other nations in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, signed five-year deals to acquire $ 1.4 trillion in weapons from U.S. arms dealers. The deal was announced immediately after the U.S. announced that it would reduce its military personnel in the Middle East by 9,500 and close the Guantanamo Bay prison.","token_len":298,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,6.4079,5.744,0.3586,0.0864,2.2454,1.6708,8.6705,6.0612,7.0249,1.8805,1.3306,6.3049,2.0653,2.6057,7.5593,0.4035,2.6451,13.749,1.2233,7.4696,0.2119,2.9847,5.351,2.8367,1.1684,2.6391,4.5243,0.3429,4.2104,0.9061,2.637,0.1222,0.5278,0.4616,1.9143,6.937,1.6146,4.4622,1.6261,3.4068,0.0015,0.8109,1.0967,3.3134,0.2041,2.9186,2.6739,4.8813,2.9284,3.1402,6.0034,4.03,0.579,3.8053,0.1078,2.7076,0.1647,1.391,3.1951,2.4893,1.6723,6.5707,0.0182,1.1989,1.6711,0.0051,1.1795,3.2371,3.55,1.8179,0.0962,5.0406,4.9358,2.4349,11.9269,1.3405,4.1661,5.301,3.5093,3.9434,5.4054,5.4669,6.7129,0.6507,2.4277,3.3605,5.7314,1.6215,3.8155,1.9271,6.0776,1.551,1.4222,2.6424,0.2759,2.1993,0.4551,1.7141,0.0011,0.0683,0.0522,3.7327,5.5856,0.0511,0.0003,0.043,0.0073,0.0,0.0422,1.8741,0.4405,5.0375,1.0997,5.3385,3.3276,2.2058,2.5535,2.3632,1.5395,3.2828,0.0023,1.724,2.5941,0.0008,0.0029,0.3612,2.9459,17.2149,7.0317,4.2509,4.9207,4.7374,0.2309,4.3631,2.7938,8.1918,0.3683,3.8177,0.5031,5.0004,1.3069,0.9919,0.476,5.8604,0.0023,0.0921,3.5019,2.9301,3.9062,1.6084,3.1106,0.0793,4.634,4.0515,2.2586,1.333,4.2698,4.7002,4.2981,0.6811,3.8982,2.7046,3.7937,6.001,0.0122,6.1572,2.7601,0.0059,8.3286,5.4469,4.6559,6.2394,5.6951,1.9937,4.4304,2.9473,2.069,3.6492,5.9382,5.9672,3.1076,1.1735,1.3546,2.8808,2.1379,2.4108,1.2899,2.8726,2.1504,2.048,5.1211,4.4916,5.3865,0.7637,1.4081,2.2067,4.4483,0.31,0.7938,2.0447,6.0245,2.2177,4.9498,4.5909,1.3747,4.768,4.2542,0.4196,1.2628,0.0006,0.0018,0.0959,0.4964,0.2194,2.5192,2.5192,6.9441,0.0063,4.0025,7.0992,0.8782,7.8224,2.179,2.8353,0.4163,1.8744,0.0073,2.2589,1.3132,1.2544,0.0007,1.0936,1.87,0.6683,0.0121,0.002,0.3335,1.0851,7.8174,1.6161,0.0969,2.148,1.5804,2.7714,4.2798,2.5706,0.1445,2.4685,1.6849,1.0575,3.6956,2.7963,4.0719,0.0003,0.002,0.1736,2.6573,1.6375,0.6507,1.3392,1.8049,1.8812,1.6185,7.9301,0.2303,0.9387,1.9131,0.0005,0.0281,0.1233,3.1256,1.9112,1.0387,1.0401,4.8674,0.5758,2.3573,6.7113,1.4059,1.3491,1.4134,0.0111,1.0795,4.931,1.3476,2.2642,3.3183,4.9872,1.7379,2.704,0.0932,0.8853,1.01]}

But the administration is phasing the plan out.\nThe move comes just days after the president's administration announced that illegal immigrants in the United States for five or more years would lose health insurance and would be limited in some government programs.\n\"From today, all DACA recipients must reapply for the Deferred Action program,\" a Treasury Department official told CNN, adding the program \"will no longer be available\".\nDACA was signed in 2012 by then President Obama. Those were then young people who had lived in the United States illegally and came to the country as young children. DACA gives temporary work permits and some other protection to more than 650,000 young people, and the program continues despite legal challenges being mounted by Republicans.\nPresident Trump has long considered ending DACA. He has called for immigrants to be treated more like American citizens who come legally.\nThe move by the Treasury Department will not immediately impact the young people who are already on the program, according to the official.\n\"So we will not be disenrolling people for being under DACA or disenrolling people based on how they live in the United States.

(See: Japanese husband leaves infant alone in bath while he goes for a walk.)\nWhen Kajiwara came back home, he told police his wife had taken his daughter to the Naha hospital as he came home, but when he got back he found her dead inside their house at Isehara, in the Osaka prefecture.\nTheir son said last week he had seen dark skinned people in the living- room the night his elder sister\u2019s death, and wondered whether the body was hers.","token_len":299,"entropy":[7.1917,3.6559,2.9111,2.007,1.5998,2.6953,1.0606,1.8487,6.7938,5.4069,7.813,0.0299,0.025,0.0238,0.0008,1.5061,9.1263,1.0684,0.002,1.2379,1.2354,7.4151,2.0574,4.5621,1.3902,1.255,10.5708,0.5081,2.129,5.0617,4.2704,2.0117,2.5584,1.0388,1.3762,2.8209,5.5586,0.0079,8.8691,14.7271,6.4064,9.7243,6.6584,11.1688,3.4722,3.9847,3.9138,7.6677,0.899,0.2733,19.2702,6.2877,2.1257,3.4094,4.213,4.1936,0.7727,1.9022,1.902,0.7795,7.8093,1.8784,3.5014,4.3927,1.3864,0.2918,4.665,0.3101,2.1423,0.2397,2.3459,2.4177,4.6727,3.3514,4.2707,2.6611,0.0062,0.0012,0.0023,1.9129,1.4665,5.8599,1.3938,5.9479,0.9655,3.1507,4.9297,5.9142,1.9941,5.6372,1.8391,0.7978,5.6967,0.1122,2.479,2.9514,0.7221,13.1989,7.2112,0.9926,7.0371,0.4742,0.5821,0.3947,4.0086,3.7779,2.2783,2.9091,1.9929,0.0047,0.0021,0.0015,3.984,1.9462,5.299,5.558,1.1275,0.8658,1.4241,9.1718,0.0051,4.9817,0.1204,4.082,3.225,4.1809,2.1505,0.3754,0.9474,3.8819,3.0077,1.1044,5.0485,4.276,2.2242,1.3933,5.4884,4.1707,1.7089,3.0336,1.5171,6.1117,0.906,0.8504,6.0701,4.6026,0.6922,0.005,4.0032,3.9688,3.1413,1.5986,3.3716,0.4331,0.0071,0.6093,0.6959,4.6727,1.5768,2.3764,6.0354,2.3486,5.5139,2.3272,1.0311,1.4342,5.079,1.283,4.0385,1.4025,0.4487,1.7841,4.7567,1.0111,3.9103,2.2337,3.2124,5.462,2.52,2.7412,2.6736,0.0048,0.0024,0.0022,0.8104,4.0983,0.9794,0.2171,5.3077,2.725,2.0808,0.6737,5.7186,4.0839,3.2372,4.2693,9.5045,6.4627,7.6503,6.6666,1.5092,3.8023,6.1974,3.0449,3.6236,3.264,2.4705,1.4887,2.1189,0.2026,3.1812,1.2108,0.0044,0.0027,0.0017,4.2014,1.0027,2.2473,0.8174,0.9022,2.4455,2.1957,3.4169,1.5763,0.9997,3.7312,2.2038,1.6092,0.8875,1.1771,6.7533,0.013,3.1687,4.2186,3.2965,6.2321,2.0028,2.6787,1.5723,2.8036,0.8307,2.7318,1.8792,2.835,1.4125,1.3921,1.8762,3.381,4.4836,2.6735,5.275,9.9901,4.078,4.382,2.1071,2.4058,2.8324,1.0217,8.0017,3.4664,0.0521,0.7089,0.527,5.157,2.584,4.9172,6.8961,0.9425,2.9835,1.5288,3.1214,10.6556,5.7832,2.7161,3.1528,1.9389,0.7855,3.7818,6.389,10.4805,7.106,1.7871,3.9423,10.3313,1.5924,7.558,0.2089,0.1277,1.9231,1.9534,1.0705,5.3394,2.3671,2.0424,5.2999,1.1722,3.6252,0.4729]}

The President has absolutely no direct contact with Russians,\u201d Sessions said during a regular committee meeting.\nThe comments came as Republican senators expressed surprise that their Democrat leader Mitch McConnell had not asked Sessions to testify under oath after the president called Trump his confidant and told Sessions to get Russia to stop interfering in U.S. elections.\nTrump made public comments about Sessions on Twitter saying in June that he was \u201cone of the dumbest people that ever ran for office\u201d and that Sessions had \u201cacted like a loser.\u201d\nIn his prepared statement for Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Sessions said he had no knowledge of any interactions between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin or any contact with foreign intelligence agencies.\nHe said he told senators that he had only briefed Attorney General William Barr and others on his \u201cbest guesses\u201d on the campaign\u2019s Moscow contacts.\nSessions was a member of the Trump campaign\u2019s legal team during the 2016 election and is one of the many people who has declined to testify under oath about his contact with foreign officials.","token_len":301,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6125,1.638,1.4591,0.0032,8.6041,4.6908,1.7881,0.0447,3.3318,7.0074,14.0566,8.2514,4.5532,0.5165,1.8559,5.9355,0.2384,3.0013,0.9031,0.0143,2.6386,2.3219,1.9832,8.3092,7.6878,0.9703,1.087,0.8227,0.7765,4.9752,0.7535,0.0786,3.5224,0.8617,0.3201,1.1057,1.7163,0.2916,0.2116,0.2225,16.7703,5.5973,4.903,3.9708,3.1197,1.7194,5.572,0.8507,0.8817,3.8524,1.47,2.5302,1.2286,4.606,0.7475,0.581,3.2996,3.2477,4.2509,0.0012,0.0017,0.0153,2.0211,0.2424,3.5627,2.9661,4.6898,0.7604,1.3173,2.4747,3.7455,1.8039,1.0223,5.0444,6.9908,3.1015,2.7189,1.1419,1.4573,5.1979,0.6094,6.1762,2.5134,0.1081,3.5051,2.3034,9.6598,6.8135,7.6892,1.1036,3.0892,0.5925,7.8723,5.4077,2.4074,1.6082,0.3429,5.5738,5.1749,1.779,1.9075,4.4919,2.3497,4.1627,3.8693,1.4414,5.4736,5.6624,4.119,7.1705,0.0023,2.233,1.6061,3.7042,0.8473,0.7787,3.7103,4.0099,0.0098,4.4393,1.6871,2.9448,4.2047,3.669,5.0499,10.4481,0.3936,1.7569,3.8971,6.4365,1.3303,4.0444,5.8895,2.4219,0.5869,0.3777,0.2354,3.5082,0.0002,0.0009,0.0035,0.4445,0.2397,0.2292,3.657,4.842,5.5654,3.1867,1.4354,3.0065,1.8892,3.6636,6.6179,4.1928,3.4562,0.5802,0.7425,2.1508,13.8584,3.1494,7.4738,0.219,0.6818,7.0492,0.0921,0.5564,3.7671,0.591,3.4161,0.2317,1.1845,2.7646,3.273,1.3278,1.333,1.7962,1.9223,8.548,0.6941,6.9719,2.5529,0.5564,5.1294,1.2924,5.5105,2.6945,0.7063,3.8794,2.5606,4.863,1.5146,4.911,3.1299,6.6492,3.8751,5.2924,0.5813,0.1514,0.3439,0.8225,1.1118,1.5824,2.3697,1.1604,0.1807,0.8593,3.9747,0.9336,3.9326,0.6959,0.2779,0.6899,3.3924,0.0511,0.0077,3.1696,1.5588,3.3909,1.0433,3.6127,4.1805,2.0381,0.9104,0.3793,2.9393,1.0049,0.6732,5.0279,5.1731,1.5352,0.5869,1.149,3.7761,5.238,5.4394,0.0023,9.4363,9.3145,2.5348,2.7352,1.1751,2.7069,14.2892,0.3965,9.0638,5.3046,1.3408,1.7992,3.6677,1.5506,6.491,10.4549,2.031,0.7105,8.2142,1.8017,0.6716,0.336,4.1161,0.0047,3.3545,4.9978,2.355,0.0038,0.2429,4.2215,0.9582,7.4319,1.3669,0.0496,4.883,0.1707,2.51,0.106,0.5953,1.5328,1.7972,3.3131,3.7983,0.0152,0.8317,5.0789,2.8934,0.9288,4.3523,6.7494,0.1384,1.0887,0.5607,0.028,1.8586,1.7269,4.7398,0.0314,4.2485,1.4866,0.7273]}

On Tuesday, Trump said that the protests over the death of Floyd were part of \u201csocialist terrorism.\u201d But he made no mention of Trump\u2019s critics, nor did he acknowledge that the protests had turned violent during an election campaign when violence of any stripe will be seen negatively by voters.","token_len":301,"entropy":[11.3422,8.5096,7.7422,13.0832,4.7295,12.6334,4.9497,0.0218,0.0506,0.1128,4.4414,0.4225,0.0071,4.9212,7.6326,2.7729,5.1933,4.2621,0.8494,2.0248,1.9356,3.4787,1.5875,7.3334,9.2785,0.0047,1.5752,1.4728,0.7515,6.9017,2.064,1.2531,3.0493,5.9592,1.1392,3.5056,0.33,5.5319,4.8404,6.0372,9.361,0.551,16.6117,5.2089,8.9351,1.5881,1.0553,3.4518,1.509,5.2041,1.5874,6.3809,4.2303,1.3684,3.748,1.5641,5.0706,5.8914,4.8257,2.3139,2.1929,1.3929,0.0033,3.0327,5.5496,7.0354,1.2452,5.3078,2.0086,0.4683,1.0377,3.2903,3.3226,6.5473,3.9573,3.0794,0.16,2.8321,1.519,2.8598,2.3594,3.0801,3.696,0.0034,0.1589,0.8093,0.446,7.0212,3.5809,2.4846,2.2103,1.4824,4.0052,0.0082,4.7649,6.2077,2.7529,1.4901,6.2415,0.1409,2.6213,2.254,7.6278,0.0085,0.3021,7.931,2.0828,0.5123,1.9596,2.4518,5.6325,0.5317,0.2127,1.1326,0.6133,2.5485,2.3978,3.0875,2.4324,0.6034,2.3288,3.9472,0.5476,0.3901,6.4896,0.6581,3.9474,10.0074,3.4539,0.5236,5.8764,5.1813,0.1846,0.2386,0.6484,4.0016,0.5376,1.5048,2.7589,3.352,2.3193,2.8486,6.0609,1.653,0.6625,1.1077,1.0216,0.669,1.3824,4.8277,3.9538,1.1463,1.2584,2.5308,2.7998,1.0844,7.0312,7.6053,2.5499,5.709,0.0044,6.0319,1.8452,5.3645,0.2791,3.0238,4.5713,1.7056,0.2245,4.5044,3.1242,2.4691,3.5927,3.7513,1.3859,4.5317,1.93,1.5218,2.3481,3.148,3.6459,0.0101,5.0526,2.5563,2.3016,0.8948,1.8221,0.6295,3.4173,4.2614,0.9986,5.4085,3.775,6.5063,0.969,2.3801,13.2116,2.9838,7.0696,1.8785,2.4114,3.8078,1.5543,0.8887,1.8945,3.4588,5.1172,0.132,0.0665,6.6325,0.0046,8.0616,3.6108,0.5458,0.203,4.5232,2.219,5.1052,6.1231,2.3721,1.0293,0.8334,3.6704,1.9004,2.1423,3.3273,4.1938,2.1618,9.6973,0.8326,2.8728,4.2773,3.2212,2.2736,3.458,0.8069,0.0023,1.3347,6.0775,2.816,0.3741,1.875,2.2703,1.5938,2.1223,5.0847,4.9411,0.7957,3.8644,0.0614,10.5484,5.7555,3.2099,0.0028,7.9641,0.6774,8.8152,2.2655,3.9034,2.4752,4.3578,1.5414,4.8612,1.421,4.7634,0.7628,0.4325,0.0709,4.7042,2.7663,0.1911,0.0346,6.744,1.3794,4.5329,1.1756,0.1317,3.8255,1.1515,1.8386,1.622,2.3733,4.16,0.2871,4.4896,4.6331,0.4431,2.4362,3.3311,3.7839,6.1252,1.0498,6.764,8.0988,1.9618,2.9534,8.8652,2.05,2.5157,0.4135]}

The standoff between","text":"The leaders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan pledged on Monday to improve relations, after ties between the two former Soviet republics degenerated into a trade war under the previous Kyrgyz leadership. The standoff between the economies of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan erupted in January, when President Sooronbay Jeenbekov banned imports of Kyrgyz goods, including beverages and tobacco.

In the aftermath, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s economy deteriorated quickly, leading to concerns of a recession in the country.

But as the crew of the fishing boat made the trip to a Japanese island off the coast of the Korean Peninsula, the ship\u2019s crew called from the side of the vessel, saying they had been on autopilot for four hours and were now being detained by a Japanese Coast Guard vessel, which they could not reach. A Coast Guard official said that the officers from the island of Kume had boarded the vessel. They were searching the boat\u2019s boat and the crew, before declaring that its captain was a convicted drug trafficker, according to Japanese reports. The captain and eight crew members were turned over to Japan\u2019s Coast Guard. But as Japan\u2019s Coast Guard pulled the boat towards their vessel, the crew of the vessel shouted through the radio that the \u201cJapans shouldn\u2019t have done this, they are abusing us\u201c. The North Korean captain was detained by the officers. As the media reported, the ship was searched, and what has been found was unclear. It reportedly had a message board on board stating \u201cJapanese Coast Guard\u201d. The police said they had a search warrant for the message board, but did not want to comment on the motive for the boarding.","token_len":306,"entropy":[8.1964,11.2864,1.4681,4.0588,2.4687,6.3615,0.6982,6.9575,0.1853,1.8718,0.9353,3.421,2.9564,4.434,2.2355,3.0858,2.1477,3.5691,4.1811,0.8268,1.0401,4.5424,3.7802,3.3963,7.6661,0.5992,2.4885,2.3475,3.3912,1.2554,0.1895,0.6293,0.015,4.4092,0.237,2.8067,0.0001,3.5519,3.9895,4.2705,7.0139,1.2863,3.4207,1.1127,2.0957,0.0032,0.0313,1.997,0.779,16.5182,7.7891,6.01,0.5578,1.7609,0.006,0.28,0.3277,7.2026,4.5854,1.4123,4.4126,3.193,0.4047,1.9545,0.7496,3.2433,4.0582,2.9299,1.2461,2.6856,2.6636,0.8024,3.4091,0.2616,0.21,0.2787,2.0576,0.9361,0.8456,0.2133,1.5587,4.0419,12.4858,1.4116,0.1496,1.8928,5.0453,6.6061,1.2668,6.9655,0.4109,0.1119,4.7141,1.8195,3.6277,0.6511,1.3828,1.4945,4.8622,7.1721,0.0024,1.4982,4.7788,0.5534,2.0177,1.8384,4.1883,3.068,4.8635,2.2192,3.6132,1.5941,3.2782,0.0253,1.4985,2.2452,4.1392,2.4893,4.9439,0.2063,2.4185,0.4789,4.4411,3.5246,0.0119,1.6307,0.8179,2.1016,0.9403,6.4816,4.004,0.2736,6.5878,2.7541,3.5426,10.7725,9.9107,2.8068,0.4802,1.6191,3.2176,4.2153,1.3051,6.2297,2.6975,3.6821,6.6376,0.0228,0.1273,5.5123,2.3475,2.7521,1.8392,2.7005,6.8849,8.027,1.2999,7.0067,3.5502,1.2173,3.3211,6.9664,3.2392,1.3402,0.0024,1.8139,2.729,0.0013,3.2632,4.8712,0.2465,1.1948,5.0598,3.1485,5.6062,0.951,0.1381,0.9546,7.8244,0.4008,0.1252,2.6665,5.5936,0.0111,0.0037,3.2499,0.0201,1.8067,4.8621,2.793,3.3597,2.2217,0.0053,0.002,3.6213,0.0027,5.5158,1.3503,2.5452,6.182,4.9729,3.577,0.3427,0.9776,0.9671,3.061,0.1352,2.9497,5.0845,5.7006,1.049,2.2654,1.2591,1.5051,14.4553,4.0306,4.8363,3.7485,4.8078,7.5421,0.6759,0.3504,0.2598,3.134,3.8052,2.0093,1.1337,5.6045,6.2954,9.7821,4.7976,2.4609,5.1767,3.6288,1.1203,4.2269,0.2933,4.1901,2.5494,2.3434,1.7673,0.6905,6.0716,2.8096,4.5604,0.774,6.656,2.443,0.4284,0.586,4.0711,1.5494,5.6573,2.757,1.0979,6.8102,5.2077,0.621,4.1293,2.7942,6.2162,0.5889,3.5705,7.5335,2.6901,1.8642,8.2573,4.5658,2.4661,1.4402,4.9324,7.0508,0.9996,5.4328,3.2623,0.0533,3.2689,6.8392,4.8048,1.3409,5.0998,2.611,1.8663,1.5722,4.7371,1.99,0.1013,1.5874,0.2873,9.7055,0.0385,1.2481,0.8465,2.2529,0.004,6.4822,0.0937,2.7943,1.1637,1.1341,6.1945,1.6927,0.3671,7.013,0.9927]}

The legislation will target individuals and entities involved in the alleged hacks and spying on campaign associates of 2016 presidential candidate Democrat Hillary Clinton (D-NY), but it will not target specific individuals, who could face more sanctions, Corker said. The legislation would also prohibit countries and entities from using \u201cany Russian financial system to pay off or conceal their obligations on sanctions imposed under foreign law\u201d by Washington, he added. The House of Representatives and the White House have indicated that they want sanctions to go far beyond those already imposed under the 2015 Iran, North Korea and Syria arms embargoes. The bill also would require American firms seeking to enter the Russian market to obtain waivers from the U.S. Treasury Department, which is expected to move forward on the provision, Corker said. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department, however, said it was planning to consider a waiver. The legislation is expected to be widely supported in the U.S. Senate, and is likely to pass unanimously.

Two people in the vehicle opened fire, killing one person and damaging the car, they said in a statement. A Thai soldier opened fire on the car, injuring another person in the incident, police said. The four men and their two victims were taken to a hospital in Cattaie for treatment of the wound from the gunshot. Police said the four men were accused of carrying out carjackings, drug-related crimes and violence. The men were held for questioning at a special anti-gang unit in Bangkok. The Hells Angels were founded in California in the 1970s and are regarded, with members in many Asian countries, as organized crime. Their members are known for carrying out motorcycle shootouts, sometimes at police posts or other targets. The Hells Angels have made several attacks on foreign diplomatic and consular buildings in Bangkok, as well as on foreigners and foreigners visiting Thailand. On April 18, 2008, the Hells Angels attacked police posts in Bangkok, killing three policemen and wounding 15 others.

Fighters armed with heavy weapons and vehicles carried out an ambush at the camp for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) on the outskirts of Bossangoa, where peacekeepers are stationed, said a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country, which counts nearly 11,000 peacekeepers and 2,000 soldiers. U.N. peacekeepers are among the hundreds of soldiers and other military officers killed this year. Most of the rest are being detained or killed by rival militia or rebel groups. He added peacekeepers were also being attacked by armed civilians. Peacekeepers deployed in the area in September 2015 to assist communities in recovering from months of fighting that left millions of people internally displaced and hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in neighboring Guinea, Chad and Cameroon. Since then, rebels in Central African Republic have fought against army troops and the main rebellion group, the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), has been fighting to take Bangui. The peacekeepers attacked a car carrying peacekeepers on the same road that had taken them to the town, the spokesman said.\nDear Lord, thank you for Jesus. This day is His day.

And even under US law, public officials have been immune from liability for disinformation campaigns carried out outside the country.\n\u201cWe want to establish very clear rules that govern the dissemination of propaganda on social media,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, a Democrat from South Carolina. \u201cIt is our responsibility for both fairness and civics to ensure free and open discourse, and I think social media platforms have an obligation to do so, too. \u201d\nSanford said the United States must find a way to monitor foreign political actors that use social media. \u201cWe need to be vigilant and ensure that all foreign actors in social media are prohibited from doing partisan activities and political activities, as well as providing anonymity,\u201d he explained.\nAt the very least, Facebook and Google should have the same penalties as TV stations and radio stations, which are required to have an exemption from the requirements imposed by federal law.

In a statement today, Federal MP and party foreign affairs spokeswoman Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger said there were two major implications for Europe from Trump s move in recognition of Israel s sovereignty over the Al-Aqsa mosque (the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem s Old Town) and the U.S. embassy s move to Jerusalem. Lautenschl\u00e4ger said that Trump s actions put pressure on Palestinians to abandon their desire for a two- state solution, thereby creating a potential threat to the peace process. Lautenschlaeger also said that an unrecognized capital is no longer a member state and should not be admitted to the European Union or the Council of Europe, the statement said. Lautenschl\u00e4ger said she regretted that the Trump Administration had taken the decision on the Al-Aqsa mosque and the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, but she argued that this decision should not be linked to the negotiations on the peace process and the two state solution. Lautenschl\u00e4ger said that recognition of Israel s sovereignty over Al-Aqsa did not support the two state solution. Lautenschl\u00e4ger said that the Israeli government should stop the construction of new Israeli settlements and that Israel should respect the Palestinian withdrawal agreement from Gaza in 2005.","token_len":312,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.3145,8.5815,4.407,4.9684,3.3462,0.7668,2.589,0.1227,6.6592,0.3707,0.0153,1.812,15.2371,1.7368,2.0245,3.111,1.3521,0.4754,0.0004,0.2318,0.0194,0.59,1.4966,1.9556,2.2524,7.2957,0.0485,5.3415,11.8698,7.4356,2.0452,1.9515,8.4421,0.4113,2.6906,0.46,0.1889,5.8149,0.6193,1.5297,6.1964,0.233,7.043,8.5486,3.37,4.9126,6.6704,0.5307,3.0563,6.2168,0.0758,4.9315,3.4766,1.6168,1.1017,2.3589,6.1041,4.0362,0.54,4.6163,2.1273,3.8489,3.3816,5.6915,1.3886,4.6844,4.7064,0.9432,4.6459,2.8312,4.1144,3.8789,0.1639,3.0748,0.5608,6.241,2.1209,0.3952,7.4729,0.2474,0.0173,0.0042,0.0,1.767,6.7382,4.1108,4.5751,0.0005,0.0004,0.0,3.9158,0.2852,9.7289,5.4643,12.0238,2.433,0.9429,1.3625,3.1688,0.007,0.1301,0.1158,0.9671,3.198,7.0029,1.7195,0.3476,0.5089,1.9867,0.0005,0.0034,0.0017,0.0058,0.0094,0.0021,0.7672,1.8758,2.8796,1.2849,3.7796,6.3871,3.8148,0.0415,9.0101,1.0438,4.7966,0.9756,4.3354,0.9737,0.9304,1.2553,0.2416,9.1513,0.1318,2.4673,6.1984,3.7778,1.1117,4.165,2.6548,0.2418,1.4178,1.8873,0.0945,0.6397,2.5398,0.0006,0.0054,0.0023,0.0061,8.7015,0.0066,2.2185,0.8235,0.5603,5.4396,10.1342,0.1572,5.0946,3.3122,4.1113,0.2871,1.7746,9.4556,4.8191,2.7923,3.5571,1.7389,0.1961,6.7334,0.862,0.5989,4.8517,0.0272,3.62,1.4934,4.8937,0.5638,0.1448,2.4234,2.9773,6.7621,0.722,0.0653,2.3948,0.0022,0.0067,0.0033,0.0087,0.0276,0.0016,1.0077,3.6711,5.7434,0.6531,1.4918,4.1283,2.9885,1.5412,2.583,1.8084,1.6498,4.1987,1.5399,4.5379,0.0689,0.0423,0.004,0.0006,0.4617,1.9103,2.1808,1.3788,0.0022,0.0056,0.0478,0.3953,3.5803,2.8363,1.5029,1.2976,2.4134,6.3941,0.1549,3.3961,1.568,2.3994,0.6726,0.8021,7.0206,0.0875,1.2394,6.8032,2.1866,0.9968,2.2322,0.2694,3.0233,2.7748,4.8442,4.5795,0.0955,0.7735,1.8867,0.0004,0.0083,0.0039,0.0065,0.0365,0.0014,0.8125,0.6925,7.7512,0.1261,2.2149,0.2788,0.6707,0.7698,4.0119,0.0298,0.0047,0.0022,0.001,5.95,0.0373,6.4055,0.7064,3.5064,0.5827,0.1073,2.061,1.9451,0.0025,0.0098,0.0041,0.0054,0.0442,0.0013,0.7502,0.4479,1.5348,4.9633,1.0013,2.0477,4.0395,3.4115,3.6718,0.1487,2.4105,2.9085,0.2605,1.5506,2.551,3.6439,1.6181,3.9322,0.7221,3.1972,6.4175,1.7675,4.7187,3.7936,4.8938,6.2236,0.5902]}

The two reporters for the National Geographic channel were stabbed in the stomachs, according to the minister Ntsay Makwaya. In another attack hours earlier, there was an explosion outside the World Bank buildings in Libreville, capital of Gabon, the Defense Ministry said. The attack left three personnel of the World Bank seriously injured and one dead, Defense Minister Makwaya told reporters, adding that the assailant fled in a white Hyundai car with a green banner. He says police have detained a number of suspects, and they have also searched a nearby mall. The white Hyundai car the assailant fled in can only be seen from a distance, said one witness seen by CNN. A police officer who witnessed the incident said the police raid also found an explosive device. An official at the World Bank said the injured people had been evacuated to an unnamed hospital. This is a reminder of a 2008 attack outside a construction site on the outskirts of Libreville that injured 13. The National Geographic Television channel, whose employees were on the scene, said the staff were unharmed. The BBC reported that two of the three injured in the latest incident were still in a critical condition.

A violent crackdown by the","text":"Myanmar s army said on Monday that security forces have discovered a mass grave on the edge of a village in Rakhine State, and have launched an investigation. A violent crackdown by the government on ethnic Muslims last October led to widespread displacement and human rights abuses. Since then, it has also caused tens of thousands of Burmese Muslims to flee the country. The military said the grave found near Sittwe in Kalay township had more than 100 bodies, most of them men. At least one body carried a gunshot wound in the head, the army said in a statement on its website. Many other bodies showed signs of torture and multiple wounds. The army did not disclose the identities of the bodies or say exactly when they were found. The military said the bodies were not from the area where ethnic insurgents were said to be based on Friday's report. On Saturday, army spokesman Zaw Min Tun announced that troops had killed 50 rebels in a clash late on Friday and said two police officers died and about 30 were wounded. The army has been fighting mostly local villagers accused of aiding ethnic insurgents in Rakhine State. Some ethnic insurgents have been blamed by Burmese security forces for recent bombings in Yangon, at Burmese embassy buildings in Dhaka and other places.

This will be the third time in as many weeks that Republicans propose new tax cuts without the support of Democrats in the House.\nThe Trump administration has been moving forward with tax law changes, though it has not issued new guidance on whether employers should reduce their tax bill. Tax breaks have been provided by the tax law to employers for hiring employees, for childcare benefits, for providing training and education to new employees, and for improving the health and safety of employees and customers.\nWealthy individuals can also claim a deduction for items used to reduce medical risks or to maintain good health.\nLast week, the U.S. Senate approved legislation that would significantly reduce some federal tax benefits for health insurance, including coverage in the workplace.\nRep. Jason Smith (R-Ohio), a tax specialist who writes tax bills for the House Ways and Means Committee, said he expects the House to act quickly on tax changes this year and have the legislation passed before the elections in November. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Tuesday that he hopes tax legislation will be finalized before the end of September.\nA version of this article appeared in the October 10, 2020 edition of Education World with the headline 'Top U.S. House Republican to press tax bills this year'.

If it comes to the decision we will support the European legal procedure, said spokesman Steffen Seibert. The comments indicate that Germany is ready to take on the case if the Commission opens legal proceedings. The German government told the European commission, in fact, the country can change the law only according to the constitution and in the form of a law. I am not aware of any legal decisions that this has happened.\nIt appears as if Facebook is ready to take legal action against companies that post political or religious content on its platforms, according to the New York Times. This step appears to come after a recent ruling by a panel of the German parliament which made the case for the company as being a media platform. When Facebook comes face-to-face with European law, it usually has the edge, according to the Times, but it appears as if there is growing support for the rule of law also in the EU. That would allow European Union governments to take ownership of media platforms and block political content. As of yet, the rules are only in the making and only have been approved by the German parliament. This has been criticized as a step back by many people, including political activists, who fear that it will make Europe more hostile to the free flow of information. The European Commission is also likely to argue against the idea on grounds that it would restrict its ability to enforce its own policies in the field of data protection.","token_len":314,"entropy":[6.1251,5.6816,1.5272,4.5936,3.0615,4.3579,0.9184,8.8254,7.1323,1.8453,4.7395,3.3445,7.3835,4.4036,6.1091,1.4772,2.7317,2.1957,0.6813,0.7803,3.1534,1.7082,0.5273,1.0576,1.8579,0.113,7.4408,3.0073,4.8197,0.492,2.4623,5.0939,7.393,0.8956,3.2432,1.9299,1.432,8.3177,4.4983,2.1011,3.8091,4.1917,2.2153,0.002,0.0019,0.0057,0.0052,0.4397,3.275,5.6213,6.6399,0.6987,2.349,1.5193,2.7129,0.0974,2.4532,2.9875,1.1946,3.4868,2.1422,1.6324,2.4222,2.8804,4.3157,0.1111,2.014,2.5998,2.382,1.0472,6.043,2.0203,3.3327,3.8918,4.4769,2.8171,5.8906,0.0171,4.0447,3.9669,5.0716,5.6026,1.5351,1.3266,3.9437,6.8536,0.0027,0.9549,4.9171,2.5241,4.2475,1.7289,6.0923,0.1004,0.9434,2.6968,1.0116,7.3427,2.7163,1.5291,1.8515,0.1691,0.4481,3.327,5.3116,1.5469,4.7973,3.5778,3.018,1.5576,2.0929,10.5013,4.2911,3.3214,0.7876,9.8592,1.3703,3.8223,0.0837,1.8629,4.0282,0.0748,0.488,7.4416,1.2898,4.968,3.8667,3.6146,2.2723,0.851,1.8311,0.7437,3.2991,1.618,2.9253,0.0027,1.9104,5.13,0.0808,0.104,0.3236,4.4403,7.2377,4.7027,0.2256,3.8379,1.6765,2.3921,3.626,2.2637,0.4771,2.3055,4.7525,0.3272,0.8049,3.5053,2.8581,3.0382,5.5792,2.275,1.4073,1.3105,2.5839,4.5722,7.0106,3.8035,2.5586,6.112,2.3899,1.4029,6.2226,2.6495,6.4447,5.4234,1.1718,0.0035,0.0005,0.0007,0.0183,5.6344,2.0403,0.9952,0.9272,6.6623,3.0353,2.7822,8.5771,2.3123,3.0977,0.0017,1.1392,0.939,2.006,1.6636,2.1471,4.3567,2.0623,0.2542,4.0669,0.8445,5.4942,3.651,0.4867,1.2508,6.2227,2.0461,0.0081,8.3675,1.7654,1.8254,3.3935,0.3745,5.2232,3.5384,4.2183,5.5536,4.4695,3.5033,0.1784,2.315,7.1874,0.2019,4.6296,1.9896,2.0708,4.8072,4.3009,1.0635,1.5112,4.4224,3.3996,4.2104,0.2343,1.6523,4.7288,2.4042,4.3206,1.8073,1.6935,8.0271,1.8042,4.8249,3.1577,1.2617,2.4189,0.1851,0.5484,2.3799,0.9815,0.5964,4.2953,3.6957,2.4731,5.0874,1.4517,1.0574,2.8946,3.9061,4.542,2.4882,4.327,1.5539,1.4757,5.3911,3.4597,1.3476,0.8845,4.2053,0.5969,3.3055,1.6093,3.4762,4.4428,1.2357,3.6781,0.3217,2.2646,2.3469,1.492,0.0132,0.2698,0.6656,2.4006,2.7664,0.532,1.9662,2.5106,4.0987,0.03,5.5445,2.7493,0.9401,4.2481,6.1708,3.44,0.4175,0.8246,2.1225,5.0182,3.3609,1.5109,0.0121,3.2875,1.801,0.8943,3.6979,3.1801,0.8738,5.241,0.4641,4.4057,0.447,0.4683]}

The move","text":"Same-sex couples will be allowed to marry in Austria from 2019, the country s supreme court ruled on Tuesday and said a law to the contrary violated the principle of non-discrimination. The move follows an unexpected decision by the regional parliament of Upper Austria to allow same-sex couples to wed in 2009. The state supreme court s ruling came after the Constitutional Court, a higher court, said in May that same-sex unions did not violate the constitutional principle of non-discrimination. The Constitutional Court s ruling upheld a law approved by the Vienna parliament on July 4 in which gay marriage was legalized. But the ruling also said the parliament s subsequent decision recognizing same-sex unions as a civil partnership violated the law s non-discrimination principle. (AP ) The Vienna court s ruling is expected to have wider policy implications for other post-Communist countries considering gay marriage. In the 1990s, it was an exception to the rule among the so-called Eastern Europeans that had rejected the principle of non-discrimination in their constitutions. Now it s a standard that most of them have adopted. And there is a lot of pressure for it to be imposed on them. LESS... MORE. read more\nThis article was co-authored by David Carlisle.

Merkel was","text":"Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she wanted to conclude exploratory talks on a possible coalition with the center-left Social Democrats ( SPD ) by mid-January to end Germany s political deadlock. Merkel was still weighing a move to seek a third term in her job when she issued the statement. With an expected election to take place on September 5, 2014, the chancellor hopes for a breakthrough deal with the party to break the cycle of political uncertainty that has hampered economic growth and stalled reforms. Merkel said the current alliance with the far-right Free Democrats ( FDP ) and the conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) could break apart, but she and the Social Democrats have shown willingness to consider a new partnership. The statement said both parties had set a tentative date of 17 January 2014 to begin talks. Merkel insisted she would give a definitive response to the question of when to launch consultations only after the SPD was in a position to put together a coalition platform. \" I need the SPD and the other political parties to tell me so I can answer the question on when we will discuss the coalition, \" she told state radio Deutschlandfunk. German chancellor Angela Merkel and her party, the Social Democrats (SPD), have so far refused to commit to a coalition with their right-leaning partners\u2014the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP). However, Merkel is considering a coalition with her social partners to break their impasse and enable her to form a new cabinet after elections to the Bundestag set for September 5, 2014.","token_len":315,"entropy":[9.8523,4.6478,0.001,2.86,1.7742,1.9997,2.2393,3.4963,0.5588,7.5001,11.102,0.0188,0.1314,2.0149,1.9777,2.6098,5.3114,1.3298,1.1518,3.6084,0.0639,0.9779,1.3724,0.1526,1.8456,12.9087,0.7761,4.8821,3.1545,0.0494,3.3913,3.8622,3.7183,4.7325,10.588,3.8536,2.5436,0.0063,2.0207,4.4402,3.2284,5.6288,5.5181,2.3055,4.7531,0.4553,3.8701,0.7204,2.4,0.8407,1.1311,3.3585,5.4029,4.137,0.5771,6.3804,2.3661,2.4604,0.7646,6.4813,4.6894,3.0854,2.5227,3.4513,1.3434,0.0031,1.8201,3.9898,3.4225,0.2303,4.9764,0.1761,1.7174,3.1784,4.0524,3.4386,0.4306,3.5049,4.1271,2.3561,0.7249,4.2853,3.4507,4.711,0.9297,4.4481,0.4894,2.0759,4.9565,2.1771,0.5198,4.1403,5.8347,0.4548,1.4741,5.7615,5.7775,0.7885,3.296,2.1668,1.961,4.8743,7.6057,2.3215,0.4044,3.7612,0.3453,0.3959,3.8955,0.3256,0.7283,0.2769,0.0102,0.2619,2.2618,0.8644,3.4125,0.8968,1.1464,0.1228,0.0683,0.0001,0.2205,2.8335,5.8232,3.6307,2.7851,1.7439,1.6702,4.9118,1.799,2.2494,0.0886,2.6746,5.329,5.9042,0.0506,4.0538,1.5446,1.8356,3.8322,0.8369,2.1965,5.8628,2.4646,5.5399,0.6786,2.4003,5.8662,1.9761,5.3002,2.55,1.1864,5.9494,1.1265,2.1434,2.3441,2.3917,1.4613,1.4831,2.8656,6.209,2.1817,1.6315,4.9893,2.2548,4.5729,4.509,1.137,0.7208,4.5695,0.4399,4.2247,3.0941,5.1623,6.9039,8.637,1.1135,1.4782,4.7288,3.9289,3.0335,1.9397,3.7155,0.0669,5.6111,3.0627,0.4446,1.4352,8.252,0.5597,1.627,8.133,4.4776,3.2878,2.5623,2.237,1.1104,5.6537,3.8626,0.1083,0.2884,6.4581,1.0975,6.4393,2.8444,0.3465,6.4597,1.319,0.2691,4.2154,3.73,2.4715,1.6878,4.9914,1.9459,3.383,3.3556,6.686,0.7988,2.5637,6.4171,3.1204,7.6899,0.0451,0.0274,0.1197,0.0077,0.9131,5.6442,3.8189,0.3282,0.0018,4.3456,1.7427,4.0578,3.313,0.3847,1.5684,0.0739,1.1508,2.2357,0.0002,1.6573,1.6355,6.3103,0.0036,2.7789,0.0445,3.0497,0.1669,0.6684,2.1819,1.8872,4.0663,4.1786,0.176,2.1421,3.73,8.32,1.5008,3.2916,0.5538,0.7815,0.7314,0.0001,0.9153,0.205,0.1497,4.739,1.822,0.11,0.0173,0.4953,0.0021,2.0488,3.8046,0.0169,2.2186,2.9457,4.2776,1.1402,2.8797,0.5919,4.8834,7.0311,6.7498,2.6431,3.5442,6.165,5.1465,0.001,2.0614,6.1143,1.3485,0.3915,4.2893,0.2521,1.069,6.5253,3.5843,4.377,2.6293,1.9456,1.4981,0.0003,0.0,9.4657,0.1488,1.2094,1.2845,1.6174,0.2642,0.1117]}

Jerry Brown asked the state Legislature to give a second look to in 2016. The plan would have set the standard so that gas plants could close between 2025 and 2030 and coal plants could shut between 2030 and 2045.\nThe move came after the California Supreme Court struck the measure down last year, ruling that California\u2019s statewide law of equalization couldn\u2019t prevent a state agency from making rules that discriminated based on the source of power.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty important decision,\u201d said Dan Kraft, executive director of the Center for Clean Energy Ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s important because it allows utilities to make progress on renewable energy and a net-zero energy future.\u201d\nA group of state regulators \u2014 including the California Energy Commission \u2014 had expressed opposition to the measure.

{"prompt":"Plans to buy a new presidential jet for France s Emmanuel Macron could be held up because of a controversy sparked by his prime minister , who hired a private plane for 350,000 euros (","text":"Plans to buy a new presidential jet for France s Emmanuel Macron could be held up because of a controversy sparked by his prime minister, who hired a private plane for 350,000 euros ($470,000) for a visit to the Middle East. A presidential adviser said that it would be difficult to persuade Macron that they had no connection to a man who works for one of his ministers. A spokesman for Prime Minister Jean Castex, whose Air Force 1, which is used when he travels abroad, was used by a private pilot for his two-day visit to Egypt in late January, also said the flights were a contractual matter. In addition, the presidential administration said that it was working on the purchase of a new presidential jet. France has been among the hardest-hit countries in Europe by the coronavirus pandemic. Macron has said the virus has cost the French economy more than 50 billion euros, most of which came in the second quarter. In spite of this hardship, the majority of French citizens back the government and they appear to be enjoying the way their president, who has been lauded internationally for his handling of the crisis, is leading France through it. The popularity of Macron, a former banker who built a successful start-up business before entering politics, has shown no sign of declining as France battles with the economic slowdown and a spike in coronavirus cases. The virus has killed more than 44,000 people in France and infected 2.8 million. Two million people are taking part in a nationwide lockdown, which ended in November despite a spike in infections.","token_len":316,"entropy":[6.8176,1.4849,5.3232,2.5661,2.633,8.7658,3.8119,2.6289,8.441,10.4919,11.9842,0.0005,5.4373,1.6237,6.7474,0.3441,4.7662,0.7834,2.1497,5.7471,5.8377,0.1723,2.33,9.7615,0.2748,3.0774,1.8012,8.8835,1.0562,1.9048,3.8527,1.8098,11.7662,2.3082,0.0011,0.167,0.7057,4.4766,0.0186,0.11,0.268,2.3085,0.9367,3.1289,0.4559,1.5397,3.5686,0.0202,1.0412,4.7436,5.5617,5.6284,1.3079,2.3886,3.7615,1.5531,0.6747,2.256,0.4309,4.5263,3.0274,4.3475,4.9923,2.9295,3.9877,5.0502,0.8398,3.4516,6.7893,0.8858,5.2559,0.5713,5.4099,0.2001,1.9914,4.7259,0.6707,4.01,1.6029,0.2579,5.5119,0.0016,2.6548,12.0228,12.3438,3.1373,3.9449,7.9198,2.6039,5.8405,3.8151,3.591,1.7227,2.7339,7.6123,3.4828,2.1721,2.0825,0.2668,2.6731,8.1872,1.3959,2.9787,2.9107,5.1904,1.9833,2.962,5.0,1.2032,0.7592,0.7732,0.4033,3.2009,2.0611,4.0059,2.7961,1.2506,3.9986,0.9159,1.9873,5.2326,0.8705,4.0434,7.0062,1.9278,0.3596,4.1773,3.6556,0.2436,1.5226,6.0507,5.2857,2.9871,1.6625,1.8857,1.5105,3.3565,1.5749,3.0152,3.7014,0.6116,0.7329,0.7796,2.3369,0.1825,1.3305,3.7464,1.5977,1.5376,6.2006,0.3486,6.5499,2.7169,0.0094,0.9114,1.3805,3.5348,1.3799,1.7224,15.8277,7.1425,3.0746,6.1017,0.1478,1.6785,7.4133,1.574,2.2319,2.5621,2.0515,1.9806,5.9899,1.6706,1.8719,0.1446,2.2186,0.0063,5.1054,0.9716,0.0931,1.973,5.3226,0.0666,0.8562,4.8706,3.2982,1.3365,7.0948,0.84,1.861,3.4314,6.5506,0.0122,2.7848,8.1767,0.0585,1.6574,7.7576,0.034,1.3788,1.9933,6.7444,1.6764,2.9074,3.9303,5.7703,5.5967,0.3598,0.6095,3.6237,1.5133,8.0461,3.8537,4.1184,3.6456,2.1994,1.2699,1.8162,5.5296,4.7265,0.4643,0.4806,4.0911,0.0022,0.4289,0.9718,0.1591,1.8178,5.8604,1.8991,3.4013,3.746,0.1144,2.4149,7.0057,0.0874,1.2386,2.6022,2.3952,1.5359,2.6491,1.5854,6.0233,1.1476,2.4097,6.2763,0.0469,0.0047,3.7121,4.5449,3.8811,0.2606,0.4772,0.7785,5.7929,2.6777,0.6126,0.0351,3.7905,2.5173,4.856,6.2187,2.6604,1.7341,7.3466,3.2458,1.5047,2.2208,6.4594,0.0094,13.1222,0.0007,0.1063,0.8386,0.6069,2.2331,3.4279,1.3185,1.8443,1.4711,0.0936,7.4645,0.1339,0.0241,0.0518,0.8005,0.6446,2.1306,3.4386,4.2197,0.7441,2.7645,0.0422,3.2004,6.0206,4.8464,0.8591,2.311,7.4066,2.0635,0.0166,1.8917,2.5549,7.8757,2.703,2.5086,5.1992,1.6187,5.5224,6.416,1.8774,5.0875,0.1039,5.0369,0.7702]}

A deal for the Saad","text":"London-listed NMC Healthcare is in talks with the Riyadh government to take over the running of a struggling Saudi hospital, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A deal for the Saad Nasser hospital in central Riyadh, the largest in the country and frequented by wealthy patients including princes and ambassadors, would cost as much as US$6.3 billion (S$8 billion), people familiar with the matter said. The deal, once signed, would require approval from the Saudi Public Utility Corporation, the source said. The hospital employs about 2500 people in Saudi Arabia at a cost of up to US$600 million a year, the source said. Saudi King Abdullah's grandson, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is the board chair of NMC Healthcare, said a person familiar with the group. Saudi healthcare assets have been a thorn in the side of several foreign investors in recent years because of regulatory hurdles, including those imposed after one of several royal visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, which aimed to open up more up the country for tourism, business and investment. The sources said a major hurdle remains for NMC to win approval from Saudi regulators; the deal would likely require an oil fund for a partner.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on January 10, 2020, with the headline 'Treasury raises borrowing limit for HKT'.

The government said a third of the city\u2019s slums needed to be razed. There are more than 500,000 displaced people in Nigeria, mostly women and children. Most are stuck in camps or in makeshift huts built near displacement centres.

The statement comes a day after Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said his government was seeking a new border deal with Greece and Turkey. \"The Bulgarian side has never considered holding discussions on the issue. That would not help any stability of the region,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Rade Mlakar. Mlakar also said any negotiation to overhaul the border treaty between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey would be a waste of the three country's time. \"Both the Greek and the Turkish side have not made any kind of progress in the negotiations,\" he said. \"What is left from (reform of the) Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation is just some paper work. We have reached almost no results. And so we will not be able to start the negotiations regarding the agreement on the borders within the next six or nine months.\" The three countries signed the 1991 treaty that set borders along the Aegean sea. The treaty has not been amended since. The latest negotiations ended in January with the three states saying they could not come to an agreement on any of the main issues, including who would take the title of president of the commission that would oversee border security, and on the exact amount of security forces sent across these borders. Some of the issues are political and require a legislative resolution. Mlakar also said the United Kingdom could be in talks to normalize diplomatic relations with Bulgaria after the two countries reopened their embassies on Monday.","token_len":324,"entropy":[8.1214,0.8787,9.6983,8.1808,1.6126,2.091,1.3657,2.0526,8.1635,5.5016,2.1666,3.1944,8.4257,0.5039,0.563,4.5035,9.6695,1.4176,4.4492,0.8528,4.35,3.6723,8.6154,0.1715,2.0492,1.4164,2.6996,6.7398,7.2451,0.87,0.4401,0.7019,0.4262,4.035,3.0964,3.1998,3.1918,0.1866,0.1139,3.6257,1.6912,3.2453,0.0023,2.3149,0.0006,0.0011,2.1278,1.3839,2.9248,1.8519,2.0299,4.0911,1.6858,2.8197,5.1348,3.3877,0.7086,3.1342,2.0337,0.3035,0.7893,2.8413,2.0472,3.7985,4.1979,1.8425,4.7052,4.1572,7.5581,3.3091,1.5233,1.3717,2.3276,2.6578,4.1757,3.0016,2.3189,1.1562,3.901,3.1736,3.2975,0.3039,0.5164,0.5354,3.1463,7.7369,0.3816,0.3516,5.2678,1.9313,11.3242,5.9367,3.9716,5.2342,1.3777,5.0926,0.1948,0.0056,0.0002,2.6275,0.7084,4.2932,4.9224,4.7477,6.967,0.2233,2.3045,3.2727,2.8236,1.6519,2.9411,1.8376,0.126,0.0237,0.4204,1.2456,2.6741,3.9175,0.1485,4.2482,6.569,7.9682,0.2763,3.5583,0.4745,1.9066,6.5051,2.6232,2.1484,0.6003,5.2695,0.0519,1.2078,1.6513,3.6994,3.9641,0.6527,5.7,0.0017,2.5763,1.7664,1.4847,2.1541,1.824,0.6909,0.2248,0.2982,1.9967,4.6582,1.5301,4.5374,5.761,7.4716,6.9413,1.479,2.138,0.3321,2.9458,4.2986,1.3444,3.7862,0.7352,1.0906,1.7935,4.5243,5.7929,5.4772,4.7401,1.8858,2.2054,2.0816,5.3159,8.3005,1.8804,3.9647,2.149,4.2322,4.1448,1.4854,1.9102,1.2828,2.359,0.7995,0.0182,4.602,2.4084,1.1607,6.1953,0.7589,4.9489,2.1762,0.52,2.5661,6.4352,1.3086,0.3696,3.2824,4.5542,2.7596,0.6251,0.395,2.1625,5.7976,0.7176,3.4001,0.9935,6.9553,2.8977,3.4318,3.9451,4.3205,4.1394,0.4056,2.1558,0.0001,0.0003,3.7963,1.8182,1.6967,2.538,3.0699,2.7765,0.5032,3.319,0.4684,1.4363,2.1509,4.3392,4.7393,6.2554,1.078,4.0575,3.1696,1.7072,5.0406,5.0903,4.8117,0.3877,2.9675,0.7166,5.4375,0.485,0.6272,0.0708,1.0255,2.8935,3.236,0.2544,5.386,0.5194,2.2037,1.0317,4.8852,1.4272,3.6688,2.7206,5.5384,0.3405,4.5184,0.8798,0.4429,9.5513,3.4125,2.688,2.4209,3.7605,1.9972,2.622,3.3435,3.3813,1.8459,5.8222,5.353,0.1845,5.0136,3.873,6.2038,5.9819,8.2623,0.8418,0.2387,5.5332,2.0249,0.3328,2.5604,2.762,6.1601,1.9059,5.6373,1.9198,4.8894,4.3429,0.9331,4.4846,0.2413,0.0083,0.0006,3.0288,0.4934,1.6366,4.77,2.8766,4.0646,3.6427,3.7533,1.6578,2.1475,7.9284,0.2234,5.1976,0.1503,0.7192,2.4899,3.3498,1.1862,4.1834,0.9349,6.2982,1.4813,1.5378,3.3787,2.4749,0.4508]}

He said that Trump told him that he did not want to talk to North Korean officials.\n\u201cAnd as for the situation there, that remains unchanged,\u201d he said in an interview with NBC television that was aired on Wednesday. He added that the new sanctions announced last month by the US will not impact relations with North Korea.\n\u201cWe have not negotiated over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons. But that does not mean it hasn\u2019t always been that way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we continue to have pressure on North Korea, we can have better relations with North Korea and a more positive outcome for North Korea,\u201d the diplomat said.","token_len":325,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,2.0087,3.5952,4.6584,6.8694,2.3782,1.9089,1.0996,9.8106,0.0748,6.0583,1.2003,2.7079,2.2693,5.2232,0.9624,3.5845,0.037,10.2356,0.0083,0.2037,5.599,2.6235,1.7041,3.7545,1.0217,1.5409,8.4944,0.0441,5.0155,6.1318,0.4287,0.0362,0.0005,0.6283,1.1097,6.2793,5.4246,0.2305,1.3528,1.6081,0.1656,0.329,18.0032,1.0106,0.1722,1.6686,4.1197,3.0089,4.4435,2.0773,1.2988,0.2965,2.4513,3.9209,1.814,5.5845,1.9084,7.1499,0.001,0.5345,7.2247,0.079,0.0,0.0153,0.0001,0.8249,2.233,3.5511,3.0003,7.4522,0.8384,0.0126,0.6105,0.0042,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.1634,0.6234,3.5375,1.3957,2.755,1.6636,3.1469,5.6416,5.4751,6.2493,0.1474,0.5163,1.2587,15.0801,6.7687,8.8215,1.6462,1.3174,2.8882,7.1345,0.2624,0.7628,2.2418,0.6495,4.2858,5.5245,1.9279,0.3088,6.267,0.0004,1.0022,1.3772,4.0347,3.7574,0.8341,0.3531,4.4055,1.447,6.6668,1.6832,5.1999,2.2325,1.4595,0.481,0.0034,0.3833,3.8949,0.0239,5.5133,0.651,0.157,1.2027,3.7384,0.9826,0.2861,1.6003,4.8673,6.0342,1.2018,0.2312,1.7128,3.0985,0.0186,0.7991,5.0358,0.0886,2.1151,0.4049,3.6947,0.002,0.0,8.7406,6.1497,2.7361,4.0349,1.1284,6.2296,2.4886,1.739,1.4961,4.0493,0.1125,0.9553,3.9817,1.5652,2.4089,2.9129,0.3787,4.2806,0.4013,0.7545,4.5831,0.0217,0.4377,8.9274,7.0651,9.2788,16.1957,1.1872,2.6623,1.8949,1.2993,3.7987,5.4778,0.4953,1.0244,1.4153,3.9627,0.0299,1.1745,0.4064,3.4194,1.7949,1.167,1.954,2.6077,1.8558,0.3771,1.3597,0.3562,4.5642,4.1621,2.154,1.0519,5.1511,5.151,0.7974,5.4262,4.7182,4.4598,1.2703,0.132,1.4282,0.6985,0.1865,4.0257,1.8983,0.1219,0.6769,5.1166,7.0216,2.9057,6.9626,2.4579,0.7895,2.1609,0.2953,3.0092,2.0637,0.1805,1.4527,5.2641,3.1796,6.3769,3.3541,2.0335,1.5903,0.6122,3.4446,4.0697,1.4908,4.6856,4.5203,0.731,0.5559,0.0159,0.7212,0.2325,1.0321,0.1486,5.0622,2.004,2.9749,6.337,5.9276,3.7346,0.0904,4.0691,3.5272,0.812,1.0171,2.2808,1.7029,3.8376,2.9822,2.3496,0.051,0.2714,3.2443,5.7081,4.0117,5.928,0.1942,6.2824,0.354,3.6045,0.0293,1.7277,0.0673,0.4,0.2705,0.2067,0.2044,4.7046,0.0445,2.1769,3.667,1.497,2.8698,0.2647,3.5743,7.241,0.72,0.9497,0.0952,0.5827,1.8939,2.3869,3.2834,4.1933,1.2414,0.5251,2.9792,0.0399,2.7477,4.4859,2.4501,3.0971,3.9518,1.4568,2.9865,0.0367,1.6319,0.1626,0.1857,4.6318,2.3144,0.7666,0.0968]}

But an unpublished copy of a draft agreement negotiated by ministers from the two sides shows that the proposal on a border control regime will not entirely satisfy the EU.\nThe draft, which is being kept under wraps, outlines a scheme in which a third country flag is displayed on goods and drivers' licences as part of customs checks along the border.\nThe proposal, written in detail by the EU commission\u2019s Brexit negotiating director-general Michel Barnier, suggests a number of new measures to ensure the Irish border remains closed to border checks in the future, though it does not require this border to be completely defenced.\nBarnier\u2019s plan to use a third country flag on goods and drivers\u2019 licences, plus \u201cother measures\u201d, would be part of the mechanism.\nIt would also include a mechanism for a \u201cfast track\u201d route in case of \u201curgent cases\u201d, similar to mechanisms that have been put in place in some EU countries to clear goods from a border with a view to preventing the spread of the pandemic.","token_len":326,"entropy":[11.4529,3.2126,1.6461,2.9068,7.61,0.4319,2.1332,2.5091,3.7933,1.0658,0.843,2.101,5.986,3.5453,1.5689,7.8009,0.0584,0.1948,7.2439,6.0826,1.0212,3.5411,2.2935,0.0012,3.3361,5.091,1.9418,8.1137,6.2029,3.7568,3.9822,3.9714,1.7536,1.596,8.1516,6.1538,1.5107,3.7133,0.897,4.2402,4.5638,4.1636,3.9209,0.0926,3.4144,4.1652,1.804,7.2852,4.5359,0.8649,4.9096,1.2034,4.2074,14.3732,7.0838,6.2602,9.65,5.0771,3.8172,6.8873,8.7989,0.2397,1.3372,0.0171,7.7858,6.0286,1.1675,0.4084,2.575,0.8714,0.5426,3.6633,3.6978,0.0591,0.3092,0.4526,0.5163,13.0318,6.4208,0.3872,0.1249,2.8443,2.7299,1.0012,5.5496,0.1729,5.6372,1.3107,2.2016,1.0897,1.918,5.0679,6.8638,0.1952,1.8098,3.5577,3.7668,5.6005,2.2817,1.3355,0.0404,5.8988,5.1167,0.0569,0.018,0.7211,1.4637,1.9851,5.2929,7.9445,5.4595,0.1319,2.73,0.5511,1.9873,6.0797,0.9639,5.5645,2.7144,1.0561,1.7044,0.7343,1.9923,0.3874,1.3827,5.0736,5.544,3.4666,3.3389,3.828,3.8579,4.5095,2.4241,8.4976,3.4725,1.2451,3.1271,1.269,0.7959,1.8242,1.7405,3.9839,1.0952,1.8671,2.9505,3.383,1.2151,0.165,0.9402,5.1457,1.1112,4.0176,3.1232,0.1072,3.0706,4.3385,1.298,10.7803,3.3152,4.3652,1.5304,7.6777,1.8394,8.6061,0.2739,0.8271,4.0228,1.7137,0.0006,4.4982,0.7007,6.0774,0.1473,1.0843,0.6716,2.1689,1.6637,3.7005,2.1007,5.9025,1.6168,4.582,0.7918,1.6577,2.6437,5.1643,7.5767,0.0567,0.1832,2.8435,3.8644,3.9747,2.9984,0.0016,4.6913,0.0002,0.0,0.4675,4.2607,2.7773,3.9395,0.0014,4.0664,2.4735,1.6324,2.5481,2.1209,2.6838,1.5618,1.9431,3.5582,1.6456,5.2054,4.1901,3.7218,1.1834,1.8451,2.1109,5.0575,1.3088,1.4723,0.0777,5.649,5.9472,5.6835,1.8004,0.2442,4.3813,8.2929,5.1831,0.5682,0.6239,4.3144,0.0022,4.6573,0.0309,1.3698,5.0706,3.016,4.0633,1.8286,5.2638,0.3962,0.2849,2.4667,1.9548,0.4701,0.4437,6.4798,0.0066,6.2789,2.5112,5.7967,12.5056,4.9761,3.8361,2.3058,5.135,8.2827,2.2951,6.3345,2.5064,3.8988,0.0018,1.4153,6.8988,3.1109,1.0347,3.4223,1.9951,0.8386,2.7819,1.2365,3.3943,0.8388,3.4757,8.746,1.3905,9.0195,1.1311,0.1246,3.0572,4.5169,3.9778,3.6585,1.0258,8.0583,0.4346,7.681,0.0233,4.8971,2.0656,1.8856,2.0782,5.6358,0.0143,8.6569,2.4737,1.7172,0.3725,3.6432,0.7061,0.0051,0.9024,3.3389,2.6324,0.5729,2.2115,6.4686,4.8696,1.7719,3.9661,1.85,3.751,1.5285,7.7439,0.0426,3.4223,2.7171,5.9757,0.0092,3.9709,8.8141,0.0381,1.2691]}

While the total H-1B visas have increased by 44% between 2013 and 2019 (see related story ), a total of 22,300 visas has been issued in the past five years to H-1B visa holders.\n\u201cThe H-1B program does not work as intended, and, as a result, many American jobs and American businesses are taking advantage of countries that use the H-1B program. It is crucial that we fix our immigration system,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the statement.\nIn addition, President Trump has said he is considering a visa restricting visa program for visa holders in some Muslim-majority countries. In his statement on the shootings, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had had discussions with some Republican leaders and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.","token_len":326,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.1139,2.1149,8.4094,0.1873,1.4365,6.8559,6.8202,0.1496,1.7456,7.2321,0.3775,1.3429,8.9814,0.1229,6.4422,0.5671,3.8347,6.2964,0.0004,0.0112,0.0595,1.0589,1.362,1.8056,5.4558,2.2106,0.2034,5.2415,2.1919,7.8946,1.6692,0.6082,6.1662,2.9039,8.9232,2.5668,0.1321,3.8141,7.6356,0.0114,0.0003,0.0011,0.0534,2.5759,8.9348,1.6143,2.1897,2.8686,0.7765,0.1217,17.9654,8.2494,4.7007,4.4597,7.8972,0.0364,4.9847,1.2093,0.3026,6.5319,4.6532,3.1751,0.2146,0.1302,5.4525,0.9733,3.7486,5.9359,8.9573,3.4331,2.4258,1.3596,6.5442,0.03,0.0838,0.0214,8.0336,2.1837,0.1152,0.7271,1.8461,5.6291,4.5108,0.7703,0.3628,4.2786,5.3504,1.1639,3.7305,4.7454,0.1088,2.4663,4.8829,1.5732,10.0176,7.0494,2.8869,3.2454,0.7494,6.0722,0.8202,2.7653,3.1526,3.0841,0.0017,3.8214,2.0968,0.89,4.2469,0.1445,0.3598,10.4964,0.0995,0.1579,3.362,5.4109,4.3108,3.0748,6.0026,1.8183,1.6688,0.4468,0.8904,1.6254,3.2354,0.1587,0.0069,6.1421,0.8054,0.9903,0.952,9.8363,1.2506,4.6099,0.8833,0.0849,5.462,0.7737,1.2182,0.0209,2.9153,0.0034,0.0046,0.0362,2.2858,0.7396,3.0664,2.0919,2.5692,5.5639,2.0545,1.8299,5.9155,0.1015,0.4369,0.2791,2.7626,7.4642,3.9967,2.4937,4.6089,5.1097,0.2576,0.9963,5.5623,1.7385,6.7974,4.1924,0.0029,0.004,0.0028,2.8137,3.0944,2.6825,1.8697,5.5736,1.9604,3.311,3.2173,0.0393,6.8053,5.6384,3.2854,9.3355,1.2277,3.5838,4.442,4.2853,0.1365,4.8935,0.6906,4.3881,3.5861,5.7217,0.2353,1.0398,2.1081,0.8222,1.2595,1.9701,0.0261,3.1706,3.9748,0.0085,0.0088,0.03,2.013,0.0769,1.5459,0.3255,2.6185,0.4257,1.5722,3.8881,0.0137,0.0086,0.0034,0.6513,5.2155,0.1038,3.8117,2.7935,1.5677,1.067,1.3706,5.0149,1.4925,0.9442,0.1013,0.0429,1.7899,3.8487,2.9243,4.0908,3.5219,1.8686,1.0762,5.044,1.4404,0.0515,8.1123,1.2291,4.9023,1.325,2.3649,0.0044,0.0046,0.0037,0.4622,1.4974,4.8124,1.0998,6.1032,0.7284,3.0951,6.1311,1.9508,0.8148,0.3115,1.7564,4.6357,1.2663,1.3829,0.0016,0.0231,0.3684,1.7196,2.1186,0.7336,0.3442,0.2598,3.4438,2.7415,0.8828,3.4616,0.8551,1.5561,2.7958,1.1825,2.57,1.9659,2.1826,5.5288,9.8334,4.1906,7.1886,0.9013,5.1034,0.4623,3.1009,4.3257,3.7103,0.4171,0.0012,0.1398,0.8948,3.2716,3.2477,1.5934,2.7423,3.2339,3.7599,0.1534,0.348,0.0011,0.0229,5.0336,0.9378,0.9246,1.1546,2.9904,5.7081,1.507,0.0694,4.2084,3.9211,2.6732,2.3281,3.9516,5.4119,1.6981,0.0054,2.9949]}

{"prompt":"The United States is reviewing military options , including new intermediate-range cruise missile systems , in response to what it says is Russia s ongoing violation of a Cold War-era pact banning such missiles ,","text":"The United States is reviewing military options, including new intermediate-range cruise missile systems, in response to what it says is Russia s ongoing violation of a Cold War-era pact banning such missiles, the Pentagon said. An earlier report by The New York Times had quoted a US official saying Washington was considering new missiles.\nUS officials have spoken openly about the need for more lethal missile systems in response to repeated reports of Russia s deployment of cruise missiles into the Black Sea. Russian officials say the missiles are used for military exercises. The US said in January it had deployed missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian outpost on Polish soil that is not part of the treaty that banned the missiles, in response to Moscow s missile launches.\nUS defence officials said at the time that Moscow was violating the treaty by firing a cruise missile from Kaliningrad towards Poland with sufficient range to be in effect in the Black Sea.\nWashington had warned earlier that it was prepared to deploy cruise missiles in response to Russian violations of existing arms control treaties. US officials said in recent years that the US wanted a clear and permanent ban on missiles and space weapons, as part of a new international system that would replace the existing treaties.\nThe Pentagon said that as long as the treaty was violated, there were options that included cruise missiles and nuclear-tipped bombers that would be activated as a last resort. The United Nations has called for Washington to review and make appropriate recommendations for a new treaty to replace the existing arms control regime.\nThe United States and Russia signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty on 1987, which banned the deployment of intermediate-range missiles.","token_len":328,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.9058,7.9068,6.0246,1.2296,3.0997,0.7331,5.0324,9.9703,0.9023,0.0158,3.274,2.6626,1.3994,0.7005,2.3415,0.801,0.0037,4.4836,1.2802,2.2688,0.8382,3.8118,9.72,7.0839,3.4736,0.0335,3.0456,7.5996,0.0088,1.4896,0.1086,4.3881,5.5181,4.0091,1.7422,2.5033,2.0257,1.6961,0.2202,1.6902,6.7888,3.8187,2.2707,1.6094,3.1075,1.3124,0.0475,0.0009,5.0077,5.2878,1.7199,4.1721,0.9269,1.7812,5.0125,1.4622,1.3837,3.3601,3.1874,1.8756,0.8579,20.5271,1.9849,1.6974,6.2378,3.621,0.4584,1.1734,2.6888,0.6911,2.892,5.7564,2.6853,1.6233,2.0404,1.0408,0.0249,6.2821,5.0714,0.5612,2.9789,0.9396,5.8505,0.1029,2.0787,0.202,2.8004,1.3884,4.8883,0.0031,1.0121,4.3336,2.0523,2.076,1.4418,2.2063,0.9931,3.1957,2.6012,2.9576,3.3491,2.3591,2.8632,1.9528,4.0476,2.3418,3.2875,1.4931,1.8247,3.0119,3.6702,1.5104,5.7934,0.0012,0.0,1.0107,1.8721,1.8981,8.5211,2.0381,10.0704,2.105,3.3586,1.6823,4.0746,1.4075,0.0012,0.7827,5.4702,3.3514,3.4686,2.1365,3.5123,2.4362,3.422,0.7557,0.0348,3.7658,2.8601,4.1792,2.9876,0.8672,0.711,3.8719,4.0489,0.5917,1.4563,4.469,0.1348,0.0189,0.5187,2.9367,1.8218,5.2578,0.693,1.9415,1.0535,3.6455,2.969,2.4119,0.0254,3.1121,2.9007,0.0009,0.0005,6.358,3.0825,5.2749,8.1044,2.7221,0.5501,3.8197,4.6876,2.4746,3.4742,1.5683,3.6417,0.0006,0.6321,1.0389,4.0891,4.1634,3.2305,3.7835,1.8902,2.145,1.2633,3.4117,0.0562,1.743,1.9159,0.1701,1.8037,0.6592,0.0205,1.9477,4.6155,0.2517,5.4683,4.2461,0.4322,1.6102,0.9276,4.2695,0.656,0.9795,2.2949,6.267,3.9202,0.6532,1.8155,1.5111,4.2233,3.5808,4.2201,2.7594,3.8482,3.2344,0.0957,3.6003,3.5057,7.7097,3.3288,1.8178,2.9102,3.6959,0.0012,0.9057,3.6995,3.7798,4.5843,2.1773,1.5536,6.2651,1.0307,1.6663,3.6001,0.7422,0.5329,1.8604,3.7992,0.8737,2.5562,4.7263,3.4214,0.0056,1.2274,1.9969,1.8233,7.0966,0.6435,3.2555,3.2499,5.1894,3.6891,4.282,5.9638,0.4234,2.6858,4.1244,3.781,1.6132,0.0098,5.4446,3.7189,1.8419,1.1098,6.5706,3.4862,2.3122,2.9679,0.0645,0.7416,2.1222,3.089,4.1332,2.6534,2.9515,0.451,6.1876,0.1,4.7628,3.7544,4.3604,5.1522,3.8675,3.0251,2.6875,1.4216,1.3262,2.7022,2.4525,0.4162,0.3369,3.4367,0.5563,5.3774,0.5126,0.4809,1.6285,2.244,0.1299,2.7671,1.3555,3.8513,1.4282,3.8854,0.6174,0.041,0.0293,0.0163,2.2953,2.3453,10.8696,1.0308,1.5883,2.6597,1.1165,4.4183,0.1097,3.8503,0.0993,0.004,1.3543,1.4894]}

Rouhani spoke during a visit to Turkey to attend a conference on dialogue between civilizations, where he was to hold an audience with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cWhat they have no place for dialogue are our positions and policies. That must be clear to them,\u201d Rouhani said, according to a statement by the presidency. US Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis also visited Turkey for talks with the Turkish defence minister to discuss the war in Iraq, but did not meet Rouhani. The Iranian nuclear pact, which Tehran has repeatedly threatened to abandon, was a fundamental pillar of Rouhani\u2019s election platform and has given him a boost as he has sought to bring economic growth under way after two years of low oil prices. Rouhani\u2019s visit to Turkey comes as the nuclear deal is again on high alert.","token_len":328,"entropy":[2.241,8.2738,2.3776,6.4496,1.2198,1.9228,2.9163,7.4803,0.0003,3.1144,3.0569,0.3895,2.5514,1.7919,1.8989,4.0054,0.6203,4.3062,1.7845,0.8388,3.3479,2.4793,1.4422,1.3664,13.6668,0.1897,0.4378,0.4475,5.5209,0.654,1.316,14.1413,6.1291,0.0386,5.9493,2.4206,2.7075,0.1954,3.3699,3.7737,6.0396,0.005,6.259,1.3374,1.3733,2.0284,9.1258,0.0012,19.9588,5.9634,4.3652,3.914,2.7776,9.9852,7.3514,6.567,0.7805,7.5239,2.7976,4.9238,1.0963,1.3053,0.1676,4.7994,5.2161,2.326,3.7281,8.6009,5.5685,4.0846,4.9475,5.61,1.2178,6.4961,1.0806,0.8954,2.6729,2.6854,1.9195,3.6877,0.4994,0.0959,2.4998,1.2128,0.7981,0.0871,1.3976,1.0346,7.5332,2.1371,6.2287,4.441,5.2983,7.4175,10.9389,3.7349,5.9729,1.0722,0.0052,0.4893,2.5327,0.0212,0.3741,5.4854,3.4835,0.1639,4.9424,0.2422,1.0157,2.0483,10.9179,6.9884,0.8893,3.1231,8.6723,6.5548,6.0202,4.4652,5.1121,4.3517,7.6951,0.0931,4.6427,6.5157,3.8925,5.1583,3.2483,6.4963,5.1744,0.0445,2.4254,7.9882,3.6783,1.9489,4.2793,3.7103,1.0827,8.4364,2.9734,3.3329,5.7057,1.6756,4.6764,1.7383,2.5016,4.642,4.867,0.0437,1.236,6.2658,0.9062,6.4561,6.3804,1.4926,3.3284,3.178,5.036,6.6855,0.0457,6.2523,1.3882,2.4312,1.9457,1.7831,2.3635,5.8295,1.0888,4.2064,4.522,3.458,0.819,1.1924,0.0586,3.7752,3.0311,4.9299,1.2608,3.3453,0.8854,5.6481,1.5695,12.168,2.0242,3.7423,0.312,3.9546,4.1652,3.7358,3.5332,4.0231,0.317,2.2399,0.5348,0.0767,0.0186,0.619,0.5279,4.3187,1.2133,5.2321,4.6518,2.6386,7.3358,2.3227,0.9762,3.5146,4.5476,3.8415,7.1782,2.5044,3.5308,1.9296,3.8975,6.2862,1.7234,6.1342,1.6951,2.2835,2.4044,3.6113,2.2187,3.5989,0.4316,2.3091,4.1391,0.0034,2.462,2.1083,2.6043,0.9189,6.2833,0.5784,7.2612,2.9119,0.007,7.7988,2.746,0.0074,3.4908,2.9151,0.8916,3.6671,0.8892,1.7498,2.05,1.1553,8.9874,0.1885,4.4909,0.6263,1.2148,6.384,0.9888,3.3817,1.9898,3.4319,2.3337,0.0214,3.0282,3.6578,0.8355,2.7443,3.5596,5.1096,5.5553,2.7493,1.288,4.074,1.8504,2.9823,2.0436,0.2317,2.0967,0.5206,1.837,3.6971,6.8131,1.8443,0.0952,4.0626,6.1636,5.1069,1.3913,4.4015,4.1535,2.5678,2.4256,4.6308,0.4621,1.2913,3.2779,3.24,1.1737,2.4867,3.8391,0.1895,4.8256,4.8337,2.8104,3.5932,3.1663,3.95,4.2886,0.4689,0.1124,4.9832,1.6216,0.1155,0.2747,3.9144,2.1202,0.2494,0.0856,3.2272,0.7019,0.424,3.053,1.7638,1.6798,5.9985,0.3492,2.3578,5.8861,2.8847,6.4699,1.4039,1.4162]}

In a joint statement, the Palestinians described the move as a betrayal of the international community and the Israelis as \"irresponsible and dangerous\", saying it will only fuel conflict. Netanyahu promised the government would move the U.N. agency responsible for building homes on land transferred from the Palestinians to expand settlements in east Jerusalem, where Palestinians hold about two-thirds of the city and Israel claims it. He said Wednesday would also be a day of rejoicing for Jews around the world after Trump confirmed Jerusalem's status was a source of tension on the world s most contentious conflict. He added that all of the Jewish people would come together at a place called Temple Mount, Israel's ancient holy site associated with the biblical sites of Jerusalem. \"The recognition is a great victory of hope,\" Netanyahu wrote in an editorial. The United States \"has helped create this situation and is now having to shoulder the burden for bringing the peace process to a successful conclusion.\" The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which is dominated by the Hamas- led Islamic group, claimed it \"denies Jerusalem the dignity of being the historic, holy and spiritual capital of the Palestinian people.\" Hamas deputy leader Izz al-Din al-Qassam said Wednesday would mark the beginning of a \"historic day\". \"(The decision of the United States) is a provocation that will trigger bloodshed in Jerusalem and in all the cities in Palestine and in Al-Aqsa Mosque,\" he wrote.","token_len":328,"entropy":[11.7065,5.6264,0.0379,0.0952,0.1419,1.1972,0.5417,0.0048,11.035,8.5018,0.2941,2.0161,0.0666,6.5653,0.0101,2.3925,2.0173,1.0176,2.8113,2.6011,3.0691,5.2182,0.8839,0.8356,2.1165,2.0019,1.7542,10.505,7.5495,9.3027,2.7622,3.124,1.43,5.2641,3.0008,0.0031,0.3622,5.5736,0.5831,1.7399,0.0854,0.4284,1.2269,2.4896,6.593,0.6229,1.7995,0.0809,1.1602,3.4319,0.1966,1.1667,3.347,0.1146,1.2203,3.3359,6.4314,2.1595,1.7319,6.6855,0.1946,1.8755,3.5581,5.8808,2.6467,1.5174,4.1863,2.7087,4.4485,3.9418,1.3562,6.1343,5.4148,2.8523,5.019,0.5798,5.0673,3.7619,2.0892,0.0006,2.0145,0.1413,6.9908,2.5168,0.0674,4.7469,7.329,3.3276,3.2431,6.9121,1.3232,1.251,2.2719,0.1651,12.2066,1.0693,1.4967,4.6574,0.0052,1.5281,3.1152,2.9635,4.6452,2.7173,3.9531,0.1476,0.0023,0.0234,0.2529,2.5198,3.8182,6.1207,4.4579,5.5088,1.3832,2.8835,1.3074,6.3773,6.8001,2.675,1.8654,1.0009,3.2076,0.6655,7.0994,0.0087,1.5491,5.2627,5.6642,0.0097,0.0671,5.0523,3.7269,7.5858,2.6572,1.4396,0.9742,5.784,2.6696,8.9617,0.0096,1.6608,4.5323,1.4629,3.7465,15.505,2.3228,3.0465,5.1601,0.1886,3.8645,4.0069,0.5329,5.051,2.8491,0.9078,4.8829,1.8114,2.8072,5.0585,0.8708,3.4522,2.4134,5.2859,2.4182,3.9376,0.0022,1.7055,5.8807,0.2076,5.63,2.8244,0.2409,10.7481,0.0178,0.8056,2.0202,8.2349,0.5127,5.4455,3.1768,1.9009,2.128,4.5948,3.9351,1.0478,4.3859,1.0528,4.7801,6.4157,2.578,1.844,5.5802,0.6853,2.6056,3.1369,1.383,2.5424,3.0263,0.3919,5.0304,2.5256,5.9048,3.5423,2.4886,2.3426,1.9145,2.8269,2.4705,6.77,1.0647,6.9038,0.592,1.3228,4.3259,6.726,2.2279,1.7825,0.2049,0.5338,0.5341,2.9522,0.1571,2.181,1.9368,2.5931,2.4375,4.6811,2.0631,0.3894,0.0004,2.3696,1.1488,2.1773,4.2769,0.0161,1.1415,2.4602,2.4298,8.7088,3.8111,3.1721,0.2086,5.6881,2.5516,5.1659,5.5307,1.7711,3.8812,5.9591,6.2487,1.0391,1.7933,1.5337,7.3719,5.9853,1.9505,1.2313,4.8528,0.7711,0.152,0.6607,2.6611,0.1459,1.2548,4.2101,8.4219,1.1305,7.4812,0.0739,1.1857,0.0019,0.3905,0.1152,0.5616,0.0019,0.0377,0.0362,0.1245,0.8457,3.2723,7.9359,5.0234,0.6431,2.5266,0.009,0.9142,1.4354,3.6171,3.7935,3.3422,8.74,1.6114,4.7703,5.0614,1.3473,2.218,0.1043,0.2426,1.3582,1.0731,6.2857,2.8879,0.9912,5.8776,5.0057,1.885,3.3989,1.0938,2.3437,2.2209,1.6015,1.8984,2.3845,4.1324,2.2063,2.3871,8.0378,0.0906,0.0624,0.0061,0.0001,3.5357,1.7511,0.5226,3.7944,1.225]}

This impeachment is a sham that will be overturned at the court house in the end, but now I feel it is more important to discuss what this means in today\u2019s world and what it could mean in the future. I am proud to be in a position to be able to speak on this topic and to be able to share perspectives with everyone.\nIt is really important to know who is on that committee. The committee was founded because it is supposed to be bipartisan and nonpartisan. However, President Trump has had several of his cabinet members removed from their posts due to obstruction of Congress and refusing to allow Congress to investigate. There is also the fact that at least one of the members is known to have ties to the president as well. On the other hand, there were several new members that have been nominated for that committee. So, it is important to understand what they would like their agenda and what they believe to be the agenda of Democrats. What I would like to take a minute now to highlight are the senators that have just recently joined this committee. They are Ted Cruz of Texas and Angus King of Maine.

That includes the money refugees and their families receive to cover living expenses, transportation and child care.\nMost refugees who arrive in the U.S. under the U.S. refugee resettlement program come from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, three of the countries that were devastated by the bloody civil war that raged across Latin America between 1980 and just a few years ago. The U.S. is one of these countries.\nIn its 2018 budget proposal, the U.S. Government Accountability Office cited the impact on a small number of refugee networks that provide help for newcomers. Some have become financially strapped. Others have disappeared or moved to the U.S. because of the budget cuts.\nA U.S. government official who reviewed the GAA\u2019s report, but who wished to remain anonymous because they did not want to be cited publicly, said those cuts would disproportionately affect U.S. refugees in states that use private entities.","token_len":330,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2865,0.0161,1.7775,5.0954,8.9908,2.0117,2.6716,1.3933,9.4408,9.8479,0.5102,0.1364,2.3634,0.749,0.0176,10.9479,4.9581,0.255,0.6312,7.8297,0.1706,5.5661,0.0003,2.5893,2.4602,8.5597,3.8075,4.3311,0.6136,0.0075,6.4515,2.8987,0.8856,0.1001,2.3164,4.4914,2.7184,1.8461,2.2722,2.547,8.4344,1.4322,0.0318,0.3896,2.6401,0.0103,0.0046,4.9286,0.9862,2.9446,1.1029,0.0053,2.0542,2.5677,4.1763,3.2564,0.0063,2.0011,6.6618,0.2314,0.0582,4.1022,4.8857,1.4636,0.889,6.7055,0.8547,0.204,1.4896,0.2614,14.9684,4.9024,2.0913,0.7053,3.7743,1.2684,2.5465,2.6704,5.9377,2.4886,2.0159,2.719,2.7225,4.7476,4.442,1.2801,2.1756,0.0029,5.6782,2.2879,0.0003,0.0031,0.0015,6.5688,0.7949,0.0007,1.5524,0.7223,0.9313,1.3235,5.2932,0.3879,6.2372,5.1562,3.5584,0.0216,0.9514,2.7622,0.5225,7.6732,1.6425,3.3038,0.3398,2.5572,0.0745,3.9206,0.1866,0.6879,2.6548,1.7675,0.0989,2.4791,0.003,0.8316,1.6701,0.9603,0.1526,1.3183,0.0757,2.0797,0.0046,0.3266,3.2516,0.8449,3.7556,3.4363,2.4444,3.8858,6.1935,3.8457,2.1969,0.1531,1.5919,3.6459,4.1893,5.8606,0.3362,1.2489,3.57,0.9089,5.1729,0.1097,0.9069,0.3414,5.6942,3.1093,3.1595,1.5076,0.5061,0.1612,0.5157,0.0005,0.0009,0.0991,4.514,0.4735,4.6969,0.0007,0.0095,0.0377,1.603,1.0731,0.0266,3.8061,0.2832,5.6073,0.0003,0.2408,1.6685,1.0131,0.5928,0.9315,5.4317,0.7904,0.1796,2.4748,1.9412,4.1375,5.784,0.0924,0.3155,6.8094,0.8939,0.0178,1.7623,4.5182,2.6596,3.3556,0.0082,1.9479,4.848,0.1308,11.1654,3.453,0.5547,0.3449,0.0564,0.0635,2.5907,0.9354,0.0005,0.002,0.0498,3.1483,3.0509,0.0237,4.9561,0.3412,0.8033,0.2716,2.9047,3.9931,5.9034,0.3154,1.8282,0.196,0.2491,1.0671,0.0003,0.0022,0.0025,3.3546,0.0161,0.002,3.9951,2.0874,4.7633,2.2708,5.4409,4.0716,0.5659,0.0275,3.7571,9.4445,2.3196,5.015,5.0196,1.6135,6.016,1.8432,4.6998,3.5128,4.5364,7.0601,3.7773,2.0666,1.8146,0.726,5.4042,2.9091,4.393,1.1225,3.6729,0.8707,0.0007,0.0041,0.2282,3.3613,0.6114,2.6179,6.6763,0.6956,0.5439,0.4022,4.1646,3.1985,0.0005,0.0066,0.0103,2.7248,1.3988,2.4342,4.1541,0.194,8.6481,3.4665,13.7655,8.8538,2.3672,1.8987,3.5506,5.8746,1.3902,4.6726,0.1273,0.0193,0.0285,1.7199,3.6096,4.2571,0.0057,0.0746,0.1512,1.6173,4.6008,3.7122,0.1263,0.2251,5.0592,4.0642,2.096,4.4816,0.5806,3.8179,0.0005,0.0008,0.3331,2.5632,3.2135,6.1685,1.1418,5.7509,5.9018,6.6423,2.6104]}

The latter would presumably lead to fewer business profits to finance higher payouts for state budgets.\nThe proposal also would raise tax rates for businesses, such as oil companies, and allow the government to sell off more than $100 billion in bonds and investment income in a single year.","token_len":331,"entropy":[3.6707,1.4879,4.1883,0.0016,0.0422,0.1786,3.2983,8.5577,1.1435,0.8128,3.815,0.3563,3.3189,1.2042,6.2153,2.6838,0.115,3.1002,5.1384,1.739,4.4081,0.1764,3.9942,2.6412,4.504,2.958,1.2222,4.0887,0.9352,4.5304,0.5982,1.5807,3.6285,4.2979,3.1467,0.007,3.9477,0.5437,3.9837,0.2049,10.4705,0.3132,16.5774,4.1562,1.2682,3.8503,5.5872,2.6146,3.7138,7.8323,2.9189,5.5601,1.2151,5.4286,5.8753,5.1342,0.1827,1.4153,5.139,2.2064,4.838,2.0677,5.1226,2.8883,0.0231,6.6447,3.0877,0.7272,2.5688,0.9373,0.995,1.9653,1.9865,2.7599,3.1766,5.4764,1.0238,7.0357,4.1676,0.0032,0.0,7.6222,2.2365,0.1368,18.3105,8.8826,8.2242,12.9108,9.4855,1.5045,1.4024,6.0871,2.0204,0.1436,4.7974,1.5646,7.3576,2.7953,1.7843,0.8143,1.0065,1.527,4.5296,5.4223,4.1194,7.2429,3.0342,1.6613,1.1389,8.1623,0.2104,0.0007,2.2727,1.8647,3.9282,6.6384,1.1056,5.6019,7.9112,0.2261,1.0945,1.3343,0.7573,0.1588,0.098,3.6309,9.4135,7.5301,0.0047,4.7361,1.2871,1.8309,2.7324,5.6336,0.846,0.6932,3.4658,1.7344,0.4096,6.0355,0.3924,3.1633,0.8322,0.7441,0.3469,3.0256,0.1895,3.6121,1.4272,4.1621,1.9961,2.0957,0.4558,0.2329,0.2374,2.5761,0.8687,4.8785,1.9683,1.136,2.12,2.6458,6.4503,4.7251,0.3814,4.5541,1.8802,4.8067,3.1798,2.0145,3.8813,0.1735,4.5117,2.0403,1.0618,2.1865,3.8215,0.7384,5.0353,4.074,2.2188,2.0591,2.0459,3.3333,1.027,3.1926,0.7718,1.2918,0.7447,1.7419,3.5472,0.9707,5.7631,4.6959,0.0005,0.0028,0.0017,2.2289,2.1379,5.3428,1.809,2.091,4.5742,0.2692,4.3805,2.2365,1.7558,5.6546,1.0182,4.2995,1.4856,0.5857,4.4466,7.0897,0.2641,0.1394,0.2024,3.0052,0.7354,0.9551,0.706,5.32,8.4007,0.877,3.1182,5.5409,5.2816,2.7138,3.2035,0.3531,9.0989,0.6934,3.3146,1.5291,4.5327,5.3946,4.2667,0.6278,6.2951,2.5433,6.2455,2.965,4.674,4.0325,6.7301,1.3949,2.5381,2.753,0.4234,4.5945,1.7725,1.8719,1.7423,0.7175,2.8158,1.0581,1.8706,4.5058,3.7098,3.5372,3.027,2.9452,3.2735,5.6065,3.3233,0.4881,3.7061,0.689,2.31,0.0259,0.0035,0.2448,1.5307,0.3059,2.779,6.6804,2.4601,6.5647,3.7136,0.0516,3.9344,2.4361,3.9763,5.2459,4.5332,2.6625,5.3797,3.2853,1.3047,5.5847,7.4895,0.9842,0.33,2.4065,4.0051,2.3303,1.2877,3.1471,4.1715,0.2971,0.8039,3.3385,1.5904,5.8144,0.0129,4.9071,2.7857,0.6136,2.3135,4.8821,2.4498,2.1635,0.0259,5.1,1.6519,3.7091,3.7617,0.8931,2.2112,0.0761,0.7226,3.7881,2.419,5.5434,5.027,2.7575,2.6337,2.6534,0.2808,0.6575]}

What","text":"Britain s opposition Labour Party called on Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday to put post-Brexit membership of the single market and the customs union under discussion in talks with the European Union. What does Brexit mean for our local economy? As the UK prepares to leave the EU after months of divisive political drama it is inevitable many in the local community will ask themselves what the future will hold for Britain and our county. The European Parliament voted to give Brexit an unexpected start. Britain s No.1 newspaper the Daily Mail reported the agreement and a potential agreement on post-Brexit trade came into force on Thursday. Brexit has had a dramatic impact on the world as we know it. The Prime Minister Theresa May says she s set to announce a trade deal with Europe later on Thursday. A trade deal is on the cards but it seems increasingly unlikely to deliver anything other than a temporary reprieve until a comprehensive withdrawal deal is agreed, which will most likely not take place before 2020. While much of the nation was shocked at the news, most traders were pleased to see Britain remain part of the world trading community beyond April. While this could bring further uncertainty, the potential of cheaper imports for consumers is also good news. The best option to get access to European products is with a British or EU passport. This allows access by all UK residents to goods from anywhere in the EU and also has a strong effect on goods imported from the rest of the world. If you re a UK citizen but live outside the EU there s a good chance you don t have free movement of goods rights as these apply only within the European Union, so you may need a passport in order to travel and shop.","token_len":333,"entropy":[8.1133,9.3616,4.9821,1.2116,5.9688,1.1407,4.3375,0.0013,0.2756,0.0002,4.7671,1.3799,0.0021,13.0085,10.154,0.0829,0.0233,5.0064,0.9249,0.0002,3.5267,0.0009,1.2089,2.3851,2.8401,0.0011,7.644,5.9879,3.4598,5.3268,0.6741,0.7881,1.9764,1.0403,0.8015,9.6632,3.5951,3.0942,0.1334,0.2279,4.0438,6.2216,1.6497,0.6244,5.9726,1.8913,3.1708,2.325,0.4151,0.288,0.0147,0.404,4.5863,4.3948,0.0122,5.2606,3.3576,4.2985,4.8202,0.6818,5.6344,6.876,3.283,0.5586,3.3361,1.3557,0.2429,4.7183,1.6773,1.5441,2.3993,0.8262,3.0169,0.4238,0.3148,4.6333,2.717,2.7241,8.2851,0.5513,2.802,5.3523,3.3637,3.811,1.7991,4.3528,4.149,3.1955,6.5869,7.7199,2.4772,5.4042,8.1656,8.9363,2.8596,1.7499,5.189,4.5184,1.7431,0.8164,3.1109,2.9615,5.9849,5.5837,4.0455,6.3564,4.8707,2.1896,5.2994,0.0335,0.0834,1.2277,6.4482,2.5228,0.3914,1.2508,3.493,0.6231,5.3594,2.4732,4.0655,0.8651,2.9235,0.4426,0.1886,1.3147,6.1764,5.5793,2.8425,2.1051,0.042,0.7168,1.8473,6.3338,0.0054,5.7372,0.0015,5.0239,1.5579,8.635,5.8201,3.0749,3.0445,1.5451,4.5429,0.1704,0.8995,4.3687,3.2847,2.7715,1.3019,0.6335,4.2435,4.0401,0.2044,1.99,5.3901,0.277,1.9959,2.6619,2.5443,4.3269,5.4033,0.9487,3.7721,4.1823,4.3508,4.039,0.0041,1.0174,4.023,6.3061,0.0017,4.1619,2.4167,4.3851,4.8298,1.5301,0.3666,1.2576,3.6039,2.9302,2.357,5.6774,0.0853,3.1204,1.4202,0.5036,3.4185,4.4617,0.1874,5.279,5.9559,1.2972,0.3318,6.6088,4.7419,2.8405,2.2056,0.3394,2.5463,0.8294,3.8672,9.2408,1.9996,4.5153,2.1845,0.371,3.5489,4.991,2.6638,0.0043,0.1338,4.8422,3.616,2.9082,8.33,7.1997,1.8505,4.8055,4.5044,3.4124,5.0393,5.1551,2.275,1.8032,2.0174,4.9534,3.011,10.1045,3.5955,3.7567,4.1524,2.3799,2.7,3.9732,0.142,0.9587,1.9096,6.4462,4.9439,2.8311,3.7625,5.6636,0.0338,3.7856,2.2102,1.0107,4.5803,1.3943,4.9634,5.6455,2.3996,3.1742,0.8886,2.6469,3.4226,4.4232,5.1787,4.195,4.2317,2.3956,1.2194,3.3715,1.7485,2.8978,0.3829,0.271,1.4543,2.2229,3.7727,4.0632,2.02,3.9794,2.9771,0.1568,5.6149,4.1109,0.5609,1.6511,2.1777,0.0076,0.1017,0.4119,0.3333,3.8368,2.4358,7.9964,6.5517,2.1579,2.7468,5.5749,4.6171,1.9112,0.4731,0.571,5.4543,7.9044,1.7796,2.7587,0.2149,0.4725,5.7034,1.7184,1.3126,7.6994,1.0524,1.7191,0.4799,9.4652,3.8691,5.9202,7.6234,2.7926,5.3874,0.3734,3.6086,0.6624,2.8904,3.0999,1.9235,2.7632,2.6209,2.2546,1.1306,3.4631,0.7944,0.0355,2.3118,4.0455,4.3429,1.4461]}

The contract includes support for all three of the services PACS, the Army said.\n\"The service needs digital imaging to support the changing demands of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the new mission requirements,\" Maj. Gen. Paul F. Gannon, Director, Defense Network Systems, National Security Agency, told a news conference. \"This is not something you start small. It has a very significant financial impact for us. We also have to get it right to a cost-efficient manner given the budgetary constraints.\"\nAccording to the Army announcement, the system is now being implemented after being shipped in phases since April 1. More than 60 million images are expected to be made available in the first year, about 90 million images in 24 months. The total cost of the program is $ 1.65 billion, with about 50 percent being the contract price and the rest the service and maintenance.\nUnder the contract, Fujifilm will provide products for deployment in the Pentagon and six major Army service and support centers.\nIn addition, the company will provide product maintenance for about 1,100 medical imaging workstations that are required for medical diagnostic imaging operations throughout the Army and Army National Guard as well as medical diagnostic and operating rooms in the National Guard hospitals.","token_len":334,"entropy":[10.3825,3.6498,0.2615,0.0057,7.8775,7.1462,7.4765,0.8521,0.1407,0.0948,0.618,0.3661,4.2059,4.2252,3.1025,5.094,0.046,4.1013,0.0255,0.0019,0.001,3.6485,2.7886,2.1224,3.2125,2.1639,2.2556,1.2731,1.427,17.2206,0.2277,1.0015,2.3023,8.2604,1.0077,8.5878,10.1943,7.7207,0.0977,9.9476,3.542,6.9244,2.1133,8.4421,2.5406,2.8736,7.4889,0.896,4.7098,0.17,1.8017,6.9058,4.9255,0.6023,0.5097,4.2366,1.2464,2.1951,2.8403,5.5361,5.2237,5.4177,0.2625,0.0007,1.3163,1.5681,4.6771,1.5005,2.6811,0.3144,7.5579,4.2427,2.1654,3.3394,0.2767,1.6398,11.1662,2.8581,1.7098,1.3979,1.9726,2.565,4.3675,0.6243,5.7255,3.9359,3.0524,0.3475,3.6526,12.3719,0.0086,3.9756,2.8508,2.296,0.6348,0.3651,1.0275,10.8753,1.4926,3.9647,6.4963,4.1308,0.407,1.7603,3.2491,1.5364,7.6867,3.995,0.3717,1.2635,6.6987,0.4255,1.1125,0.5142,0.0656,1.7452,2.1905,5.5691,6.0008,4.1122,3.4287,4.3486,0.0145,0.3292,0.0012,4.1251,4.2455,0.2477,4.6645,4.4106,0.0897,5.7477,2.9929,3.6667,6.8903,3.3909,0.8986,5.8134,0.5385,1.4453,0.4224,1.9351,1.9815,1.4433,0.3321,0.8248,0.4921,2.4805,1.4962,3.1099,3.0011,3.1949,6.1862,6.4035,1.806,1.361,4.0046,3.1129,3.864,2.5403,5.3515,1.3527,3.0385,1.9453,1.8383,1.4797,4.7178,1.6279,1.5797,4.0721,3.3527,1.268,3.0909,4.8918,4.6002,0.7461,4.7788,4.245,8.938,0.6316,7.1112,0.7495,1.4633,0.3604,5.2517,0.0021,0.984,1.9236,4.5837,0.0765,0.6049,4.1866,2.2188,5.3616,2.5851,4.4901,7.3089,3.8542,5.4165,3.526,8.0726,5.4567,3.4044,3.8426,0.8973,6.8968,0.8894,4.0199,2.5676,2.1001,1.6927,4.9477,0.1635,0.1306,4.2382,1.4297,2.146,1.0568,1.2789,1.7164,1.3026,4.7632,3.873,3.483,2.0378,2.7502,6.6191,0.2631,1.2866,1.4096,5.0316,1.2933,0.7547,0.5281,3.2215,0.8294,1.6099,3.6271,0.1161,5.081,0.0543,1.3409,2.5848,4.387,4.5596,1.0472,3.5732,4.3231,5.7324,2.0319,3.0145,1.6001,1.6201,2.4496,3.4431,4.8339,7.3396,1.7442,0.6787,5.7417,0.2265,1.3555,0.1676,3.4505,0.0027,0.0005,0.0028,0.7667,1.7409,6.7916,2.4021,6.7848,1.6627,2.4045,5.7374,1.8399,7.3275,4.8974,4.7556,4.7275,4.0298,3.8478,2.6813,1.1069,1.9939,3.4211,1.2044,1.0726,0.9719,2.3888,0.3545,1.1739,5.6444,3.729,2.0429,4.8803,2.7445,0.2671,2.5713,7.2218,2.1326,7.1156,0.8243,0.0001,3.917,1.618,4.6109,1.3735,4.6454,6.3043,1.1111,3.477,6.665,0.1846,2.1209,1.8803,2.4795,2.4786,0.0082,4.5245,0.1502,0.015,4.6984,4.2228,2.6887,6.5016,5.594,2.3541,0.9753,2.8782,0.224,6.4748,0.7608]}

This included systems that were connected to the cloud, and those without security software installed.\nAlthough the threat posed by printers has become much less severe in recent years, it remains a concern, with a quarter of all devices being vulnerable to denial-of-service or file-transfer-initiated attacks. Nearly as pervasive were the issues with webcams. Almost a third of devices were vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks - about the same as devices that were vulnerable to file-transfer attacks.\nCyber-security firm Threat Dynamics, which has been leading a campaign for improved security on webcams, revealed on Monday an attack that compromised millions of cameras from manufacturers such as Fisheye, Logitech and Sony that were vulnerable to exploitation. Its report estimated that the attack, which Threat Dynamics called the CameraWare compromise, potentially affected more than 100 million cameras from the manufacturers.","token_len":334,"entropy":[7.1186,1.6063,4.0414,6.7294,0.0136,9.4866,3.6364,0.121,0.0032,0.0048,0.1693,7.6434,0.8465,3.8659,3.1213,5.4597,0.0076,0.2007,0.1423,7.3482,0.2076,6.8041,1.6068,0.0001,9.2207,3.4476,5.4202,7.0292,0.7367,5.7119,3.3229,0.0213,3.3379,7.6448,2.3248,0.1209,7.4017,7.3072,10.1142,4.9926,6.2689,3.8909,1.7174,4.0955,5.4232,4.8084,2.2134,2.3517,0.0783,0.1466,14.6654,4.5574,7.5682,1.5765,1.022,6.103,0.6918,0.3686,8.692,2.772,0.4004,1.1838,2.0908,1.4711,5.9134,5.3978,1.6049,3.7891,3.6551,0.5586,4.5975,1.2174,5.941,0.3892,6.3822,11.396,6.8392,0.6874,0.5481,6.5162,1.5951,0.8606,4.0385,2.0427,0.2498,1.2669,0.7326,0.4218,6.5909,3.3736,7.1244,4.3314,0.0004,3.6866,0.8621,0.0167,4.0692,2.819,5.2359,0.748,2.6389,1.1274,0.9564,2.0839,1.9646,0.0038,0.9219,3.279,2.5433,1.1184,1.206,0.4968,0.5545,0.9875,1.142,5.5835,0.0039,0.5633,2.7441,0.1437,4.659,1.62,0.1828,0.932,2.7469,3.4403,1.9156,5.6985,5.7413,7.6863,3.299,3.6712,0.0021,1.3234,1.9055,2.9136,3.6957,3.2207,1.9045,0.0002,1.3614,0.8734,1.5653,1.9505,1.5366,0.2105,2.2064,5.8567,2.6734,5.2654,1.5808,0.9565,5.4655,2.3408,4.6239,1.1252,1.4464,4.6229,0.4562,2.1262,5.2264,1.0083,3.6453,2.5181,4.4901,3.184,3.0426,2.5924,0.4316,0.1478,5.1474,1.4233,5.5343,2.3502,0.1208,7.5265,2.9748,3.3522,3.1399,2.0285,1.8768,1.2973,0.2426,0.0926,0.0692,2.6082,1.1425,1.301,2.7113,2.5395,2.7052,3.1614,4.6583,0.0932,1.6989,2.7099,2.8111,1.8785,0.225,5.2025,0.3276,0.0003,0.0002,0.0048,5.9307,6.2565,0.548,4.5853,1.8998,3.8125,4.1182,0.3365,0.1456,0.6968,6.6419,7.4124,11.8775,3.9738,0.9052,4.2094,1.1782,4.0641,0.3073,0.0005,3.0408,4.702,2.9579,0.7034,0.2109,3.2733,1.3487,1.1994,0.1128,2.4161,0.1208,0.0006,0.0004,0.0436,0.2747,5.4755,4.4704,4.4345,0.0483,1.1072,6.7239,1.6729,1.2364,3.8379,0.0661,1.4036,0.06,0.4447,1.8718,0.5347,0.1911,3.9686,0.0725,3.4332,0.4771,2.6805,6.735,8.6206,2.0007,0.4239,2.3795,1.9792,3.48,3.2335,2.5238,3.4412,5.1676,1.1274,3.1147,4.9179,0.2031,0.0003,0.8817,5.1319,2.9713,1.8228,6.0209,3.017,1.5758,3.1739,5.361,0.0353,7.9901,4.4229,7.281,1.7123,0.0017,6.7967,6.2139,1.6028,0.0004,0.9296,6.7389,0.1466,0.7644,2.6355,1.9039,1.8777,4.3653,0.0841,7.1468,0.8508,6.4362,3.5331,6.0063,0.4518,2.1492,1.6788,3.6438,0.7045,12.782,0.3245,3.0751,2.2244,10.5134,10.883,6.5672,0.1293,7.2817,1.5787,1.9186,0.0088,3.0273,0.6766,1.3042,4.198,3.2944,3.6962,0.9914]}

According to the relevant laws and regulations, nuclear weapons are not allowed in international organizations. Even if the DPRK has nuclear weapons, it must comply with the relevant laws and regulations of the UN Security Council.\nSo the North should give up its nuclear weapons development, stop the production and deployment of ballistic missiles, and fully respect the international consensus and resolutions of the international organizations concerned.\nNorth Korea has yet again released a satellite using a missile-powered system. The satellite is a geostationary satellite, which allows it to provide services in a region stretching from the United States to Europe. The launch was timed to take place this week, when President Obama and his American counterparts are expected to meet with President Putin of Russia and Premier Li Keqiang of China.","token_len":335,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,7.1231,7.2903,1.0414,3.9261,3.0196,4.1943,0.1079,13.4336,2.8512,2.7586,2.6546,9.2657,2.2826,3.816,0.1031,1.3475,1.863,1.8546,0.886,3.71,4.9028,6.9435,5.2347,4.2182,0.9226,7.8298,0.0001,5.9535,3.1932,2.6442,2.4092,2.5366,0.0223,0.221,4.1075,6.4732,2.3339,2.6616,3.2794,4.611,0.2062,1.1164,2.3388,3.0431,0.3021,22.204,3.1478,4.6153,2.7722,0.1474,0.2602,4.8957,1.5998,3.1854,0.3446,1.2059,2.7338,0.0049,2.3378,1.9113,3.5179,0.3504,6.7367,2.5679,2.5006,0.0006,0.0019,6.8109,1.6284,10.1405,4.3558,0.1904,0.2241,8.3886,13.1612,8.1554,0.6244,10.3008,4.3229,0.0968,1.9864,2.5137,0.975,3.0324,0.4806,0.2216,6.1614,2.7565,3.324,0.3411,2.6446,2.2513,0.002,2.1044,1.8284,4.2826,7.7534,1.1557,0.7779,2.7638,0.2758,2.8456,9.2873,3.7569,0.9897,1.2804,4.1974,0.0004,0.0002,0.8953,1.9972,1.4648,12.0874,0.0798,0.0002,0.0007,0.0001,8.7258,1.4743,3.9972,3.2565,3.3572,7.084,5.6976,2.2527,1.8673,1.2086,3.9481,1.835,2.1958,6.2242,7.2079,0.3774,4.9307,1.0553,7.5711,1.5004,7.0555,1.0716,2.5112,5.1903,0.5019,3.0036,11.0397,3.442,3.8012,3.7961,5.3529,5.3732,1.3213,1.193,2.2838,5.6243,0.6217,3.742,0.107,1.7613,0.0033,2.0797,1.6332,3.8063,4.0047,0.0503,1.6128,0.6511,2.548,4.9482,0.4721,5.2698,0.945,3.2823,0.869,0.0763,7.582,2.9604,1.9831,3.2957,4.3503,2.6591,6.5211,0.0049,1.2682,5.7281,4.5232,2.1454,1.8651,0.3493,3.2779,0.4547,1.5903,1.7906,3.0846,1.582,2.933,2.9884,2.192,5.1174,1.1014,1.5633,1.8527,2.7426,2.3395,0.3438,0.241,1.3095,2.5846,3.5468,0.1232,1.412,2.9643,1.2548,0.2682,0.0793,3.2252,0.6466,1.854,0.8144,0.0014,2.0953,2.5322,6.1207,2.7733,4.304,5.5378,5.5371,1.4713,0.8163,0.5523,1.3785,4.9011,2.2603,6.2071,2.6993,4.3172,2.3557,4.3952,0.0525,2.4228,0.2549,0.8978,0.7256,5.6323,2.0103,1.0026,1.0714,3.0947,2.4166,6.6145,0.5054,0.1869,3.5198,4.2676,4.9124,1.9076,1.1053,4.2803,0.1219,1.9546,5.5513,6.1832,5.6211,1.1001,1.715,5.9293,1.046,4.6139,3.7667,4.6662,4.6504,1.8574,1.5594,2.5163,2.3356,2.4755,6.3611,0.061,0.0222,0.0005,1.839,1.7708,1.6007,4.6347,1.3146,0.0275,4.7379,6.4806,3.3174,3.1017,5.4147,7.5107,0.3324,0.821,5.0141,0.0865,0.4112,4.1199,0.6851,1.5688,2.9053,1.9111,4.732,0.494,4.3975,0.0078,5.0307,0.6557,1.235,3.3963,4.8409,2.87,2.5906,1.7565,4.22,2.4848,2.2479,1.2903,0.0286,1.4818,1.0452,3.125,5.1487,3.7233,0.0442,1.7908,6.543,1.9054,0.0206,0.0019,0.0001,0.1266,0.3668,0.8585]}

The U.S. said it would lease the jets and operate them in the Middle East against the Islamic State group. The deal was a way for Washington to limit Saudi Arabia\u2019s reliance on American-made weapons and technology.\nThe contract would also bring U.S. sales of F-16 Fighters to more than 500 units from the initial 100 ordered in the 1990s. The Pentagon previously estimated that the deal would cost almost $6 billion.\nThe U.S. said in early July it had selected General Dynamics to supply 1,900 F-16s as part of the new order, but a final contract was not announced.

I knew I would not be able to say a word in favor of Israel.\nI did not mention it because his ambassador in London, Richard Wilson, who was a liberal, if not always a true liberal, and a man who had been in close contact with Egyptians for decades, was standing near me, and I knew that if I said a word in favor of Israel he would raise his hand in the way that he did every time I mentioned Egypt. He would say something like that is not going to work. And he would stop me, and I would start to speak and have to have someone like the ambassador say something like, don't do that.","token_len":335,"entropy":[10.1615,5.8781,10.532,1.4833,0.7101,3.6731,3.3326,1.042,6.7469,0.7833,7.8985,5.5302,0.0007,7.0908,0.589,1.7898,3.6394,1.1322,0.0746,7.1072,5.1382,0.8255,4.2379,1.7152,3.8909,1.3774,1.6243,0.5487,1.0624,1.9027,0.1617,7.1971,7.8458,7.8555,5.5101,5.1882,2.6124,4.4303,3.445,7.6518,2.0556,3.569,4.9922,3.0821,3.6663,8.8001,4.1004,2.7125,0.6832,0.1407,2.2848,3.4207,1.9133,3.2048,5.9601,3.4532,2.9549,4.7259,1.2047,2.1344,1.3098,0.1967,3.22,3.4248,0.8682,0.6726,15.5937,4.2116,2.6122,3.3734,4.3207,4.6366,1.7997,3.0895,3.8297,1.8211,7.1986,3.4463,6.6592,3.7594,4.9676,8.351,0.5455,1.466,2.1358,0.6037,3.4233,1.0549,5.4637,0.0404,2.4223,1.524,0.8231,6.5752,1.5493,4.6713,0.0263,3.4369,5.6338,3.0201,1.2013,0.9841,0.7251,3.0911,3.9486,3.8988,2.8698,5.7664,7.1827,0.4101,0.0561,1.3743,5.6429,2.9107,3.3376,6.4249,2.9905,2.8937,6.3277,0.0769,2.6902,4.2817,1.1195,5.8329,10.1383,5.7397,8.249,7.8454,1.3233,7.0229,4.7504,1.153,3.9345,4.188,3.6404,2.2236,5.4245,2.8602,2.3119,3.099,1.2082,2.6671,3.3541,2.1051,1.9052,5.7852,0.8277,0.2523,4.4566,0.877,1.2091,9.3801,0.8097,0.588,7.6499,0.1317,5.035,0.1652,1.9893,2.7043,8.4976,5.8273,6.6938,0.3848,7.2788,0.0952,4.1138,2.5332,1.4657,3.9918,2.6162,2.6276,1.4187,2.7891,6.0017,6.3423,4.4251,4.2558,5.6926,6.8898,3.0207,2.8369,3.3145,2.6375,4.3017,2.4435,5.1453,0.0845,6.714,2.1444,5.3063,3.9806,1.9251,2.8681,1.6857,2.5083,0.0009,4.8289,3.2322,0.6357,0.9367,1.7457,3.7296,3.0216,2.4611,2.6154,0.9153,0.9847,0.0038,3.0284,3.7238,0.3118,4.0475,6.5234,0.0243,3.2915,1.1929,1.5189,2.6618,4.1994,1.1638,3.8711,1.4773,1.9695,6.9252,6.4909,3.0409,5.3186,2.7859,5.6156,6.4083,0.1113,3.6918,1.2641,2.6594,5.7372,1.9886,8.1451,1.6953,5.3924,3.9298,6.2378,0.6809,0.1385,3.8241,2.6513,3.5136,1.0239,1.937,2.1057,2.6226,3.8453,0.3124,0.0158,7.5946,2.5816,2.786,0.289,1.8058,7.3187,5.1728,1.0034,2.0369,1.4078,1.6323,2.4834,1.3795,2.9416,0.6886,2.2378,3.4014,0.0704,3.0471,1.1584,0.0307,0.2841,3.1924,0.2665,5.9409,0.8736,0.5358,2.9236,3.0507,3.8293,1.1292,1.3685,1.025,6.5718,1.1295,1.4454,2.706,4.9984,0.5141,2.8821,2.9356,2.1471,1.8745,0.8186,3.2903,8.0324,2.479,5.0452,0.0285,3.6756,0.7472,2.6078,2.4701,1.9428,5.5368,2.5151,2.1346,1.042,0.9763,0.8571,4.4794,1.6082,3.3839,3.5575,5.6707,3.2342,5.4834,5.4117,5.8944,4.0669,0.9231,3.2987,0.5553,1.277,2.6991,7.8537,0.001,2.7711,0.9677,0.7041]}
{"prompt":"Survivors of a blaze that killed 71 people six months ago in the Grenfell Tower social housing block in west London wept during a multi-faith memorial service at St Paul s Cathedral on Thursday attended","text":"Survivors of a blaze that killed 71 people six months ago in the Grenfell Tower social housing block in west London wept during a multi-faith memorial service at St Paul s Cathedral on Thursday attended by celebrities including Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. The memorial was broadcast on multiple television and radio stations including BBC 1. The Cathedral is hosting a memorial service for 51 people who died in a fire at the Grenfell Tower block in London on 14 June. The victims were between the ages of 19 and 95 and many were unmarried. The fire engulfed the apartment block on the afternoon of the 16th floor just before 8pm. The Royal Voluntary Services were called to the scene within four minutes of the flames breaking out. Firefighters from different Fire and Rescue Services attended on scene to battle the blaze. A total of 31 people were trapped when the fire was extinguished. About 700 people stayed behind to assist the firefighters, including some who were evacuated in helicopters. Police said the fire had started in the kitchen of the social housing tower and spread to the other floors. Authorities suspect electrical problems might have been the cause. Firefighters were still trying to salvage the building on Thursday morning. The first investigation report released by the Home Office found no faults or breaches of Building Regulations. However, the Home Office said the report did not establish a cause of the fire that has left 71 dead, many of them young children. Several hundred people have been left homeless. There have been calls for a new inquiry into building standards, after the fire that killed at least 71 people, most of them elderly and ill. Some MPs have also said changes should be made to social housing legislation.","token_len":335,"entropy":[6.8564,2.0666,1.5299,4.3774,10.4142,2.3123,1.8793,6.3963,0.2766,8.9972,1.3629,0.0936,1.8989,1.7855,8.821,0.0161,0.0445,8.4279,0.5172,0.9658,1.7737,1.272,0.0131,10.1633,4.433,5.0569,1.2861,9.1349,0.0791,2.4328,5.1198,0.1143,1.489,2.0283,2.4797,11.5883,2.8835,1.6454,2.5913,8.356,0.009,7.2434,1.0798,4.2581,1.6432,0.0003,1.061,7.2661,0.1629,0.073,0.0001,0.3069,3.0791,4.9538,3.4432,6.2302,2.1578,7.9502,3.4185,2.5137,0.2096,0.7098,3.2499,1.9682,3.8532,3.6367,2.9865,7.4789,3.1852,5.2187,0.6532,3.087,0.0452,0.9605,9.2523,1.3557,1.267,1.1144,0.9466,3.0179,1.0834,1.2515,0.6411,2.6167,0.001,0.0845,2.1465,1.5357,3.5982,1.6344,5.1487,2.3389,0.8249,1.8138,3.3536,1.1875,5.6962,2.2676,0.0243,0.0064,3.4482,0.1074,7.0232,2.5157,5.2703,1.6149,8.6398,0.603,1.7771,2.4895,2.8874,0.8011,6.27,0.602,3.2285,1.5415,7.0391,0.0931,2.9187,3.7571,0.6782,4.0963,5.5002,1.1744,2.3987,0.6432,0.9255,1.5927,6.719,10.4092,0.0762,3.2544,4.2098,0.2706,0.783,0.4694,0.5465,4.4713,4.6626,0.5846,1.3155,0.2654,7.0307,5.118,0.1336,0.6227,3.5934,0.332,2.7248,6.2549,5.663,1.4514,0.0921,3.0233,4.0111,5.4884,2.3403,1.9965,8.3614,0.2134,0.204,0.4875,2.9152,2.4762,0.0132,4.9028,1.0456,0.5863,5.0053,5.3308,0.6723,0.9994,2.9814,2.2388,0.5497,5.3542,5.2854,1.1782,5.2975,4.0584,0.8851,2.7574,2.0402,3.3057,2.9029,2.6899,2.9998,1.5734,0.9175,4.1185,4.0735,3.9718,0.4923,4.6001,1.4912,1.851,1.4445,1.5809,2.0085,1.7252,0.8055,3.3708,1.4107,0.575,4.1419,0.0998,3.8613,1.9903,1.6578,0.6065,0.7556,5.1701,2.4684,1.153,6.5172,7.8647,9.6,2.6558,4.2031,0.1344,1.2342,1.5016,0.1252,1.2063,3.7529,0.471,2.1759,4.4767,1.5535,0.0068,9.7084,0.9652,2.6361,3.9487,1.7077,1.4823,0.8104,1.8366,4.8822,7.3366,6.2494,4.8765,1.3135,0.6196,3.8733,0.0219,3.3928,2.4559,8.7422,2.5471,4.8421,1.0286,6.5774,2.045,1.1761,3.3827,0.322,1.6936,3.4204,0.063,0.8224,1.8287,5.5461,2.845,0.1012,3.6813,2.0525,1.8152,0.5079,0.8886,0.3218,4.6115,4.7304,5.7901,7.7408,3.5927,2.5121,3.8033,0.3339,0.4014,2.3378,1.5021,0.3382,5.8974,4.822,0.9382,2.5838,0.8699,4.2673,0.6698,3.3145,4.6095,1.039,0.1833,2.4592,0.3953,2.0281,3.8103,3.0883,0.6053,6.2909,4.9814,2.3331,4.9443,1.1548,1.7944,4.0235,1.1693,1.5021,0.0004,2.6004,0.0796,3.0528,5.7769,0.1603,0.199,4.9539,2.1191,4.7123,1.028,4.6498,6.1884,0.9354,3.1115,3.5794,6.733,2.0053,0.1566,0.1292,0.1651,5.5088,0.1583,4.4992,1.352]}

Two aircraft departed the airport in the assault, they said, adding that they were carrying militants.\nThe military said it opened fire in order to protect civilians against the rocket fire and because it believed that the militants were firing from a military compound in Arich on their way to a training camp. An army statement later gave the size of the militants' force: seven.\nEgypt's military says that it has been operating in coordination with Palestinian forces at checkpoints in areas under the control of Hamas in Gaza. The military has also conducted operations in the Sinai peninsula which have killed a total of 25 militants.\nEgypt's military said Tuesday it had killed seven militants in a three-hour shooting spree in southern Sinai, a claim the movement that controls the region denies.","token_len":336,"entropy":[10.3991,3.4759,3.3297,2.648,0.8181,1.6467,2.395,1.9385,1.6452,0.5281,0.4998,1.005,1.2128,8.8617,1.9308,1.0975,0.657,2.3778,4.8812,3.2615,0.974,3.1499,0.0185,5.3547,1.9702,1.6704,0.5739,5.633,0.0473,2.5891,1.5811,2.306,0.8422,2.0477,1.5849,0.243,0.1864,0.2677,14.0802,3.5627,2.0627,5.3433,0.0012,1.3223,1.0587,0.0415,1.5365,4.8886,1.0526,1.5362,4.9158,4.6731,0.6054,4.3608,1.2083,1.2061,1.3802,0.5952,3.8825,0.5487,1.8916,1.6096,1.0744,5.086,0.6028,5.1114,4.3451,0.5898,0.2136,1.1597,1.5401,0.9413,1.1995,6.8963,4.7287,1.6033,0.1922,3.5238,4.984,2.3485,0.7243,1.8661,2.0281,1.172,0.961,0.5702,0.1616,0.4689,0.068,7.3495,5.8448,4.0518,2.4089,0.9289,0.6866,2.0395,2.7815,1.4277,3.396,4.5372,0.0273,2.5404,4.0185,0.7324,6.0106,0.8904,0.1675,1.0048,2.4127,0.8873,0.4255,0.2259,6.0638,4.9525,0.3564,3.206,1.6308,0.6397,0.9381,9.0991,0.0028,4.2043,0.2639,0.811,2.7835,0.6709,3.0017,0.0843,0.3343,5.203,0.7507,3.1564,1.8626,0.3213,2.1891,1.1595,5.2618,1.0167,2.5176,4.4267,7.0474,1.7838,2.0618,2.316,0.2255,0.1009,0.252,6.5676,6.3474,9.8185,0.0767,1.2424,0.3924,1.6439,2.2957,0.7856,1.6091,2.1423,3.9892,2.9117,5.3121,2.0332,2.5472,4.0581,1.2044,0.5507,3.875,0.0391,3.7631,10.6543,8.7322,5.9794,1.6659,4.1049,1.7673,0.0011,0.0001,1.009,2.4082,0.0013,2.5972,6.9064,0.433,4.6994,6.2359,6.8618,2.2018,2.5654,2.6679,1.1648,7.4108,1.12,4.4283,0.1602,1.3834,3.0463,0.172,2.7533,1.0303,2.5932,6.5599,1.1709,0.2175,1.4453,2.6456,0.5595,1.6223,6.4403,0.7411,2.5408,5.7104,0.018,1.5581,2.1503,5.1506,1.6531,2.8809,0.7112,2.7447,7.5207,1.8292,2.4418,1.6904,1.3054,2.5148,0.8151,3.7732,1.1656,1.7856,2.4065,5.4878,1.5923,3.8199,3.8397,5.2524,3.8756,0.3059,0.3488,2.5378,3.8328,0.4542,1.0608,5.3399,2.2083,2.3814,4.4154,6.2485,2.2035,8.4802,0.1589,0.0692,6.5235,0.2745,3.262,4.5824,5.6775,3.0413,0.253,1.6397,1.3817,0.9134,3.5287,2.4764,1.7502,1.3254,3.0923,4.3616,1.048,5.4377,0.015,4.96,2.8248,5.5148,4.5956,1.7748,5.3823,2.3693,2.4115,0.2398,0.0033,2.4907,3.5257,2.0282,1.2188,1.8648,1.9193,2.3728,1.8354,3.3492,4.2811,0.5937,0.9082,1.8936,2.8138,6.1183,1.8369,2.63,4.1264,1.0493,0.0029,4.6064,1.477,1.7088,0.3608,1.9619,1.0953,0.8854,1.4064,3.9648,1.8181,0.9084,3.3678,3.9067,0.671,1.0227,1.9604,4.4913,0.0306,2.031,5.5483,2.8328,1.285,4.2153,0.3195,1.1347,3.3322,5.0344,2.6066,7.614,5.7617,1.8487,0.8959,3.2323,3.8129,0.0792]}

District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed with two previous court challenges that the Trump administration's emergency order was not sufficiently authorized by law and the regulations violate the constitution. Chutkan s ruling is a major setback for Trump s efforts as he aims to tighten immigration controls and restrict entry into the U S. Trump's immigration policies have garnered widespread political opposition and drawn criticism from some Americans, even including his own administration, despite Trump s insistence that he was simply attempting to enforce laws already in place. The ruling comes two years after Trump signed an executive order to temporarily suspend entry for refugees and non-immigrants at the southern border with Mexico. The Trump administration previously cited the same lack of legislation to justify its temporary restrictions that took effect on Saturday. Trump has argued that the emergency order is not necessary and that any temporary action like this will have no lasting effect on the country \u2019 s immigration landscape. But the judge disagreed and said the administration \u2019 s measures violate the constitution. Chutkan ruled that the regulations, that came into effect on Saturday, violated the constitutional rights to due process. The administration \u2019 s emergency executive order banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries for a period of 90 days.\nThis piece appeared first on BusinessWeek: Tanya Chutkan partially blocks Trump\u2019s refugee ban, but does not reverse it\nA woman at the intersection of Lake Drive and West Street was struck and killed by a car late Thursday night, authorities said.","token_len":337,"entropy":[8.5834,0.966,1.5187,3.2507,9.8806,1.0826,6.316,0.035,0.0013,0.0011,3.0131,0.5599,0.0019,17.2528,6.1053,8.3263,8.9123,7.9975,0.2743,4.0153,1.8889,2.8431,3.4619,0.8912,4.2279,1.8471,5.8577,5.6754,0.5051,2.5471,3.0469,0.0395,5.0303,1.8296,2.7217,6.8175,1.6916,0.1036,2.9739,2.8334,8.2317,0.0977,6.0316,0.1264,3.1273,1.5663,0.0164,5.1118,0.8048,6.1454,3.9221,3.5969,3.7796,2.3275,1.6812,2.1914,0.197,1.3047,7.4091,1.7918,2.1539,3.0943,4.2018,8.2797,0.8788,1.065,1.9702,3.5728,6.7438,6.1778,0.7565,4.3838,1.384,2.6088,0.0022,0.0013,9.3503,2.5509,2.4825,2.347,2.5213,1.0204,0.1488,0.7248,5.1041,1.5107,7.0724,0.5981,5.7986,0.021,5.0482,1.8093,2.8352,1.5313,4.7098,2.5945,1.5568,0.0432,1.851,14.392,0.2122,6.7503,1.7004,3.7925,2.3932,1.0942,6.5983,2.128,5.0486,3.9997,2.0281,6.0886,1.4723,0.1604,2.5064,5.2349,2.3563,5.1939,3.7757,2.8413,1.0156,4.3164,1.9681,5.7591,4.093,1.9943,5.1594,0.4297,0.9247,2.6411,3.7248,5.1698,0.0549,3.9001,3.9528,4.3039,0.5342,0.0524,0.4685,2.2476,2.9694,2.9477,3.7504,3.9271,0.0239,2.0772,2.2793,0.8983,0.0416,0.0111,2.0167,1.1833,2.2298,1.7003,2.7278,2.3463,0.7286,5.2997,0.1998,3.8234,0.0002,5.2379,0.8145,3.8755,0.0351,1.6702,0.3974,0.6938,1.6134,3.0151,0.0697,5.4307,5.0203,1.4562,5.4226,7.3641,0.0117,5.489,2.0732,1.7999,1.3643,3.4572,3.4838,4.9765,4.9328,0.0365,0.9539,4.0015,0.3733,3.1416,2.4039,4.0761,0.2895,1.0759,5.6697,0.2823,1.3865,2.9645,1.4383,2.0554,1.0349,4.5977,2.8844,4.0843,8.0603,2.4173,1.9992,3.7076,1.225,5.154,0.629,0.872,0.8345,1.5524,2.0202,0.4468,1.9701,2.6273,7.3825,0.2984,3.3368,1.5666,2.0749,3.6989,1.9072,1.4268,1.2814,2.6952,6.2762,0.0905,0.0208,7.134,2.9668,0.4704,2.1884,1.986,2.1246,0.0015,0.0024,3.0275,0.359,0.6806,5.2465,3.5625,5.9947,6.8546,0.4924,0.2079,0.4403,1.8727,0.1777,2.8409,0.4939,3.2005,1.4499,4.323,2.466,0.0012,5.1709,1.673,4.2864,3.8702,0.0361,0.0029,4.5004,5.5954,0.0619,7.2242,4.0469,0.1819,0.5648,0.8916,0.0989,0.0004,0.201,3.5819,4.834,1.1186,0.068,2.0453,0.0021,1.6678,3.1319,9.4428,5.9949,5.4607,2.6349,0.3687,5.872,7.0149,6.3046,7.9776,0.3021,0.1999,0.0015,0.0047,11.9791,2.0462,1.3858,10.6448,0.1852,1.7554,3.5047,0.5857,2.9289,2.4091,4.5032,0.6217,5.0211,1.1094,2.7581,3.9084,5.582,5.6447,1.6059,4.3196,0.0572,5.4373,5.0273,0.0205,4.2603,3.5528,3.7697,3.1633,0.7624,0.1767,0.3669,0.2785,0.894,4.872,3.8389,1.1432,1.7966,2.8611,0.1296,0.1302]}

Democratic-led governors in Georgia and Mississippi, as well as a strong Democratic legislature in Illinois, all voted on carbon taxes.\nSen. John Kerry, D-Mass., voted to oppose the Iraq war as president of the Senate, saying the war was \"immoral, unwise, unnecessary, and a disastrous policy mistake.\"\nKerry, 60, who lost his reelection bid in November to U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., was one of six liberals joining 70 Democrats and Republicans to vote against the war in a 93-7 vote on Jan. 14.\nAfter the vote, Kerry, who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1997 to 2006, criticized former Sen. Bill Nelson, R-Fla., for being an \"insufficiently principled\" senator for his party's purposes.\nKerry also expressed concerns about the possibility of another war in Iraq and criticized President George W. Bush for his inability to effectively negotiate with the Taliban.\n\"I think there's a strong case for a strong American presence in Afghanistan, that we've got to make sure, yes, we maintain a presence here,\" Kerry said. \"There needs to be a strategy here with the Taliban. It shouldn't simply be a rehearsal for what could happen in Iraq.\"\nKerry said he would continue to back Afghanistan and Iraq policies, but in order for them to succeed, they would need to be changed from the Bush administration's original ideas.","token_len":337,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,8.7255,7.3403,10.6126,0.1716,7.6228,3.4198,3.0229,5.856,0.0088,7.1796,3.2356,2.6186,2.6814,0.2031,4.2451,1.0145,1.1843,6.826,1.3366,5.6149,2.776,0.3558,6.1007,4.0948,0.3041,1.48,0.1176,2.7171,2.8596,0.0335,5.58,7.3985,4.3245,3.7662,0.5141,8.0688,5.0862,1.8912,5.2176,1.6937,5.3602,1.0268,4.0631,2.3654,2.7528,0.005,0.0048,4.148,6.3782,1.9699,5.1605,0.5293,4.0799,0.3946,3.7808,3.3378,3.701,3.7636,4.1349,1.6161,0.3011,23.0416,0.0212,3.0508,4.3069,1.3104,1.1722,0.0115,0.042,0.1533,4.0617,2.3694,4.0708,0.8393,9.712,0.7651,3.8493,3.8842,4.2056,0.1244,0.5374,1.263,3.8734,1.7952,4.3437,1.6099,1.5607,6.7067,0.1004,2.3672,3.8022,0.5375,0.8861,3.8473,1.187,0.588,3.1143,6.0086,3.9169,5.7688,0.2635,0.9682,7.201,0.0009,1.6881,6.8216,0.0298,2.3539,4.5036,1.0884,2.0736,0.1345,1.0698,2.3211,2.7097,5.885,0.0018,0.0039,0.01,0.4838,0.0002,4.3793,1.0765,0.0,0.3433,0.6547,0.003,0.0948,0.0022,0.0003,0.0151,2.866,2.5009,0.0103,3.7309,8.494,7.5143,7.3563,2.3567,2.6057,2.3386,1.7749,1.3681,0.5569,0.5614,4.524,1.271,2.5773,7.868,0.0235,4.2054,0.0701,2.1847,3.5352,0.0016,3.6774,0.3364,0.4429,5.0043,1.4334,0.331,0.1418,0.8619,3.3742,0.8763,3.8989,3.6191,0.3654,0.8657,1.5288,0.0078,0.0468,1.7011,4.1854,0.2327,2.7258,0.1554,4.7275,5.7454,3.6708,0.0005,3.0534,2.0105,0.6589,1.7533,0.0027,0.0322,0.0102,0.8587,3.9835,3.5759,0.6771,4.1569,4.857,0.8379,5.1996,1.2489,1.9148,3.4127,2.3909,3.2204,1.8076,8.2167,0.497,0.3264,2.6229,0.0014,2.3152,4.1913,3.5522,0.508,1.248,5.1562,0.4539,5.0331,4.2925,1.6477,1.7804,3.0359,4.3995,3.6318,2.4241,0.0191,0.0005,0.0007,0.8627,3.1316,5.6485,0.0398,5.4129,3.4832,0.8855,1.7296,4.1352,1.0641,0.3284,1.312,1.6931,1.7956,2.6043,1.0472,0.849,4.3413,2.3219,1.3707,2.3051,4.3004,4.4345,3.8432,0.3358,2.12,1.6238,4.678,1.6448,3.8717,1.3473,0.7905,3.4195,0.5207,4.8107,5.452,0.052,0.9279,5.7504,1.9186,2.8487,3.0457,1.6461,0.4702,0.2845,0.7327,0.9159,3.4829,4.3046,0.0008,0.0062,0.8324,5.325,3.5559,5.7715,1.5335,2.0374,1.9389,2.9742,5.6494,0.0001,6.9909,0.2423,1.5564,9.7603,0.7369,3.1438,3.9385,0.4248,1.0923,0.9376,1.1895,0.1342,1.6503,0.0068,1.6865,0.7822,2.2512,3.3424,0.3131,5.4182,5.2809,2.5663,3.7726,5.2871,1.8244,1.2614,5.6626,4.5055,2.0308,3.603,0.0181,1.6799,0.3896,2.7023,2.0483,0.8898,0.3937,2.3298,5.9524,4.0494,1.9812,3.7962,0.5736,0.701,5.038,5.9897,1.0448]}

They were placed in a small plastic container which she then threw over the side of the cabin.\nA US passenger, Mr Michael D. Sloan, recorded the scene in a video. He took a picture of the scene on a mobile phone before it was deleted.\nThe CAAT said in a statement on Thursday that the video did not constitute a crime against civil aviation and that it was justified to have the private camera closed during the court proceedings.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on July 16, 2016, with the headline 'Bag dispute convict to avoid jail'.

Travelers visiting North Korea after September 1 will not be permitted entry unless they have valid visas into North Korea, which are issued on the basis of the visa conditions of the Ministry of Unification of the DPRK (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea),\" the statement said.\nThousands of Chinese tourists travel to North Korea every year to tour one of the world's last communist dictatorships. Some of them take special tours to see the remains of the massive Kim Il Sung Museum complex and the famous Kim Il Sung Mausoleum which is still the final resting place of the former dictator.\nNorth Korea had its own currency once, which it devalued in the late 80s so that the currency had no value at all. In 1987, Pyongyang declared it had the world\u2019s strongest currency because it paid off its foreign debts in this local currency. The money was so strong the government sent out people to sell the currency, and it lasted for about a month.\nDuring the Korean War, a Korean soldier in North Korea created a new Korean currency which had no value, because the North Koreans had lost the war and had to go to South Korea during the war.

May plans to push hard for a vote on the UK's exit from the bloc on October 23.\nIn London, hundreds of activists rallied against Brexit and the government's Brexit deal plans, saying they would continue to push for a vote to leave the EU on a date agreed to in the June divorce deal. They called May out saying she had betrayed the May 23 vote by keeping the Brexit date separate. A petition asking May to change Brexit plans because it was not going well has received more than 2,700 signatures from more than 70 countries.\nIn a poll Sunday, the number of people who said they are undecided about joining the EU increased to 25 percent from around 20 percent in late July. A further 32 percent said they are in favor of leaving, down from 36 percent three months ago, the poll conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs, a business group, showed. But a smaller percentage of people were in favor of remaining in the EU, falling from 47 percent in last April.\nIn other poll, a British public broadcaster revealed on Sunday its ratings audience had dropped to its lowest level by far in more than five decades, with a decline of 9 percent compared to August.","token_len":339,"entropy":[6.9938,5.0627,0.0006,2.5108,2.2006,1.9854,2.3893,1.5954,2.2704,2.092,12.466,3.0105,4.0784,0.2931,0.9724,0.0464,2.1217,8.854,0.6861,0.5433,0.1373,9.4934,7.5807,5.2137,0.5103,2.7413,5.7054,0.8041,1.2177,3.2317,0.0342,6.2258,3.4353,3.473,3.0716,3.5138,1.7649,8.6635,0.2457,2.3311,2.174,2.1358,0.3097,1.0992,5.9923,0.2528,0.1234,21.8267,2.9236,2.6937,2.7578,3.8893,4.3772,2.2478,3.3469,0.4974,2.6254,2.6436,2.6378,2.3652,5.4513,0.973,3.4598,0.719,0.4486,0.4366,0.8356,1.9762,2.2777,0.9165,1.1034,2.7363,0.1053,0.5709,5.4363,2.72,6.6715,10.8919,4.9298,0.3196,8.1332,0.3146,5.2151,5.1652,3.0923,3.4939,5.9676,8.9099,0.0031,4.4697,0.1733,3.7999,3.1613,0.8881,0.8349,0.0137,0.2244,3.9825,0.127,0.307,4.5493,6.0182,0.0908,5.1018,2.585,0.6159,0.9339,3.3493,1.3181,1.4045,3.9459,0.3345,1.9,0.8881,0.015,2.6303,2.7029,5.2686,2.6769,0.7595,0.1585,9.7763,6.2856,0.418,7.2689,0.0674,4.7566,3.3042,2.7002,2.8437,2.2631,2.5972,2.3887,0.7611,4.5547,4.3212,7.2824,1.8281,2.8243,1.2547,1.5949,4.6795,0.401,2.6404,0.4297,1.296,2.1028,2.2594,0.5181,0.6582,0.7754,3.3265,4.0735,4.048,4.0317,2.9214,1.4058,2.1392,4.2633,7.9223,1.6482,0.4865,3.5992,3.3121,5.7957,4.9119,9.01,0.6201,1.9435,5.0125,1.0958,7.8214,13.4456,2.8587,2.4671,5.7713,1.0116,4.0479,7.4864,6.0303,1.5475,4.8748,4.8312,3.9368,2.0355,0.1733,4.7739,5.6934,4.4484,8.3531,2.7394,1.628,1.8709,4.4899,3.3303,1.5691,2.544,0.8877,0.0023,2.6549,0.0945,3.0775,0.0169,3.765,2.8815,0.0002,4.6513,1.273,0.378,0.3218,2.9609,2.101,6.539,6.8753,0.5895,2.6663,5.7673,0.0905,0.5478,0.7224,1.8032,0.2775,4.2126,2.1422,2.1003,4.0928,0.0677,0.5536,2.9668,1.0854,5.5167,1.093,0.7676,7.5652,2.8326,0.0215,1.719,4.0464,2.778,0.5685,3.4429,3.049,5.3176,0.0369,0.612,0.0794,2.1168,3.4111,1.6484,0.2068,0.8969,1.9136,3.4159,0.3171,3.7576,0.0073,4.7186,0.6716,0.4215,2.2733,2.3025,0.6417,6.2959,0.2959,1.8119,3.9509,1.2171,4.4536,0.1146,2.7923,1.4399,4.4068,3.3653,1.3027,1.3148,0.3029,5.0456,3.0703,4.0598,2.6379,1.1046,1.5769,2.8686,1.4016,0.6667,0.2114,3.0284,0.9274,0.1113,0.4497,0.986,5.6793,0.7743,4.1722,0.0119,0.8557,6.3221,4.8322,1.6314,0.3741,2.6337,5.2587,6.4612,3.8092,3.0749,5.5968,3.5948,4.5566,4.7696,3.0497,0.4825,5.4164,4.2549,11.39,2.335,2.1944,1.5101,3.5849,0.0244,0.5271,7.7449,5.4055,0.7978,2.3489,0.0005,3.0188,3.4092,1.5084,2.0612,2.0112,4.0078,0.3591,3.843,0.3858,3.5315,0.6887,4.7323,1.3396]}

The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements below. No official endorsement by Reuters is given. A report on the first day of Donald Trump as president included a sentence about Trump's supporters having expressed worries that he's a nationalist.\nBush's comment has provoked an outcry across the political spectrum, though many Trump supporters claim to be apolitical. Trump supporters have also objected, saying that the claim is false and that Bush's statements aren't a reference to Trump.\n\"They're just a bunch of nitpicks,\" said the Trump campaign advisor who spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to comment for the campaign. \"They're very easy to fix if you want to.\"\nTrump's critics argue that the comment is inaccurate and doesn't reflect Trump's true beliefs and intentions. The campaign insists the comments are true and points out that his real statement was made several years ago.\n\"This is not our statement. If you look at the statement he made when he was president, it said that he believed that immigrants are contributing very much,\" the campaign spokeswoman added.\nThe tweet of the day comes as Trump and his supporters are preparing to head to Washington next week where he is expected to be inaugurated Wednesday. Trump has also warned of potential lawless scenes should Obama be sworn-in.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was quick to blast the president for his comment.\n\"For days, Donald Trump has lied and stolen. It makes me sick to see him in office,\" the former secretary of state tweeted.","token_len":340,"entropy":[7.2906,6.1509,1.6094,5.1922,2.2298,1.4007,10.3533,2.5742,3.002,0.3661,6.5793,0.6589,0.0604,0.0377,2.7618,0.7475,0.0352,2.1855,6.8098,12.1442,0.0422,1.2892,0.3752,4.9875,0.011,1.2774,2.9391,6.5302,0.1177,1.0814,2.6325,0.4469,0.6392,6.9055,2.4984,1.1834,8.2564,1.397,3.7111,4.1652,0.367,7.1271,4.6204,4.2628,1.7453,4.917,1.7132,2.3976,0.6079,6.4187,5.5012,1.8726,1.0778,7.1174,3.033,0.0935,4.7489,0.0108,9.9463,1.2538,6.9859,1.383,6.8511,3.424,3.2935,0.7506,5.2883,5.4774,5.014,8.263,1.715,1.8123,4.2658,2.9174,5.8769,0.8974,1.7724,20.8025,2.3796,5.337,4.6805,4.3775,3.1872,1.9997,4.65,0.2511,1.5923,0.1254,1.2527,5.1909,2.9396,4.4193,0.2008,5.3796,3.018,1.0867,6.2954,0.4781,0.6587,3.5108,1.9772,1.5452,2.1836,6.3121,4.3994,2.4756,1.0436,1.8694,5.9638,1.0285,3.8035,1.2688,1.3591,1.1262,1.4131,3.6244,4.7435,0.0003,4.3626,3.4951,0.0261,2.5874,1.2213,0.7072,8.718,4.8093,1.3192,2.1604,2.6251,3.5694,0.0027,7.1164,1.3444,0.574,1.2857,0.7714,4.577,3.5239,2.3006,7.9996,4.5161,2.0554,0.6288,0.4567,0.0124,0.0008,1.6339,0.8313,3.2671,0.2808,0.1356,0.0145,4.0915,5.3347,2.0923,2.7732,0.1006,0.469,2.0157,0.669,4.6271,5.8734,0.164,7.0856,4.4018,0.4836,3.5114,0.3613,2.171,0.2251,5.987,1.4292,3.9077,3.2471,0.1399,1.7828,2.6704,0.8651,4.2894,1.0653,4.8968,0.0002,0.9971,2.9315,0.1381,3.6333,2.4607,2.9275,4.6713,0.2524,2.8975,3.4686,5.6615,2.5872,2.1008,0.8178,3.4257,1.023,6.1812,0.9066,0.2062,4.8256,6.2322,5.4733,1.8729,1.6785,5.1259,1.3826,0.0449,1.1554,0.6706,0.8504,2.8944,0.7432,1.6991,5.2863,4.9841,1.6361,4.9478,1.3483,2.2758,0.1245,1.1885,4.06,2.5392,0.1691,4.3678,0.2073,0.6268,2.2266,0.6271,1.419,3.189,2.2869,1.0784,4.0336,2.2205,4.6475,2.3488,8.1075,8.2098,2.5813,5.2749,3.0172,0.864,4.0793,5.5314,0.1351,1.0069,1.7768,3.9321,6.3494,1.4013,2.6963,2.8735,1.9989,1.2654,3.318,0.9593,2.0319,1.5965,3.5321,0.6829,4.0388,0.496,3.6055,2.7385,0.2095,4.4179,2.0322,2.1488,0.3368,0.0064,3.9913,4.2761,0.0006,6.4968,0.3007,2.5674,1.4193,3.2218,5.9749,2.0886,3.84,8.4602,2.9504,8.6929,7.5591,5.3505,2.2927,1.6239,4.4939,0.0015,0.9708,0.6204,7.173,1.0229,0.7388,0.4247,0.015,3.6507,3.9808,0.0211,4.5855,1.3119,4.5703,1.8991,1.0356,3.0742,1.2044,0.7258,0.0943,5.6625,6.4242,1.0695,2.0978,0.098,0.4758,6.2385,2.1186,5.745,5.1066,3.4044,4.9271,1.1132,0.9063,0.8755,5.0568,1.3605,3.3112,1.7478,1.074,3.9452,1.0102,0.3323,0.0035,0.049,1.0357,0.9187]}

The statement came hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that the United States would withdraw from a 1997 agreement that allows foreign ministers to meet in Jerusalem and the U.S. Embassy plans to move there, saying the decision was to honor the Trump administration s move. In his statement on Wednesday, Macron, the France s foreign minister, also spoke of Trump s decision. He is a president from our country whom we admire and whose decisions we support. But the decision not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is not the right answer, Macron said. As the President of France, and from my position of president of the European Union, I reiterate our opposition to unilateral measures.

That gesture - while it was not intended to be political and has since been dismissed as quaint - left Senator Harry Reid on the defensive.\nThe next day was Sunday, November 7th. On this anniversary of the sinking Japanese battleship the USS Indianapolis, Senator Reid was scheduled to be the primary point of attack on President Obama \u2019 s record. He told Congress - the people who elected him - that there was no truth to Obama \u2019 s \u201c America First \u201d pledge and that his policies were \u201c harmful and bad. \u201d\nSenator Reid\u2019s vote disrespected millions of Americans. But it was the final straw for the Obama Administration. In the weeks and months before the election, President Obama repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the war against terrorism was already won and called for the destruction of the Taliban and al-Qaeda before elections even took place. He was never asked by Obama or the Democrats why they made the decision to go to war ; after all, the terrorists were already defeated and now Obama wanted to kill off America \u2019 s reputation for making war.\nAs one friend in an email to me said : \u201c Democrats should stop with their stupidity! \u201d\nA few weeks before the election, many Democrats, including Senator Obama, were looking to the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) for the answers. According to Politico, President Obama and his close advisors urged the DNC to avoid taking any aggressive steps against Obama before the election.","token_len":342,"entropy":[2.6222,3.0852,0.2393,2.5012,1.385,1.7471,4.2186,7.8014,3.033,4.9013,11.4248,4.2626,0.651,10.431,1.7226,2.6217,3.9624,0.0067,3.0375,3.0028,7.0442,1.3986,2.4009,7.6075,2.0589,7.6238,3.2182,2.5297,1.0208,9.7103,2.1514,4.5752,16.2861,8.1238,7.9066,2.3006,0.7062,3.5716,1.3921,0.9804,6.1889,1.0098,4.9338,0.9469,6.9642,0.8471,2.9709,4.6069,3.5168,5.6803,4.9934,3.0983,1.4571,2.9428,4.3664,0.3951,1.6889,3.172,4.3424,5.1433,3.3517,0.3955,4.655,0.5987,9.0926,1.3825,5.3758,3.004,6.389,0.0066,4.5738,0.6094,3.0048,0.8167,1.6047,8.0504,4.5418,0.7182,5.9531,6.3293,0.8325,2.6651,2.3369,1.1139,0.8797,3.7155,3.2439,6.7799,1.1725,0.5394,6.9519,10.2147,3.6196,0.0367,4.0419,1.3386,6.313,0.3039,1.318,0.7477,2.3726,4.9237,0.0347,3.3747,3.7167,6.2306,7.2025,0.4627,2.5997,1.6869,2.5412,1.1603,1.8563,0.464,2.3971,6.9443,2.4684,2.7215,4.8553,5.6804,6.0855,3.5711,5.9463,3.1196,2.4437,0.0558,0.3544,0.4213,4.1063,0.6762,0.8443,6.63,0.6461,4.89,4.0915,0.0156,0.0457,12.7835,7.2234,9.6883,7.8145,3.3911,8.5752,8.4583,2.8836,0.6265,3.2019,5.0845,1.2055,11.0047,1.9496,7.3713,3.2556,6.3565,2.3341,6.6145,5.3028,1.7896,3.1047,0.1015,6.7386,0.9845,1.5244,4.7927,7.9708,2.8787,7.7105,0.3853,0.4386,2.0564,3.9642,2.1103,1.4455,2.6179,5.1474,1.7075,1.1675,1.7763,4.0892,2.1703,1.1579,3.1317,1.4157,3.26,2.2391,0.0284,2.7925,0.7636,1.0124,0.2463,3.709,0.0973,5.3361,3.5501,0.0388,2.8134,1.4322,1.7922,3.4904,3.8231,3.8766,0.9538,4.9502,5.419,1.6715,5.8904,0.7965,2.1116,4.5685,0.0145,1.2643,4.9158,1.862,1.9197,0.9168,0.3264,5.3092,7.6264,4.0086,1.9758,0.002,0.2283,2.5112,2.767,4.7047,2.2405,2.6499,5.7101,3.7735,2.3748,3.7712,4.2139,2.732,5.7061,1.4577,1.1329,0.3855,3.9546,1.3286,0.0285,10.5088,6.2737,0.1445,0.0591,1.7573,5.5295,1.0054,1.4404,2.6039,1.6881,4.8726,2.7495,3.1406,0.3815,3.949,5.4096,4.2142,3.5268,0.1686,0.0642,7.4246,2.1668,5.926,2.8008,1.2896,0.8117,4.0317,4.4287,7.5073,4.5114,4.4396,4.9252,1.6524,0.2818,2.0044,4.479,2.7378,4.4959,6.5099,3.3334,3.131,6.6614,2.3081,7.3435,5.0632,2.4451,0.8728,0.962,4.5068,1.4313,1.3777,1.805,0.3262,0.279,0.3409,6.2544,2.6433,3.6546,0.8429,1.2571,2.9074,0.4213,1.9547,5.2072,1.4983,3.0288,3.8211,2.4278,0.0742,2.464,3.8923,0.3835,1.045,4.0536,7.7617,1.7933,4.7655,0.0026,3.7773,1.2386,5.383,0.0653,3.0743,1.5301,6.2675,3.2191,6.3135,1.0062,0.599,0.2045,6.4908,4.451,1.8054,5.8428,2.3699,2.0673,2.7243,5.1485,0.5426,0.4155,0.8029]}

{"prompt":"Thirteen Superfund sites , heavily contaminated former industrial zones , in Texas were flooded or damaged by Hurricane Harvey , but the full impact on surrounding areas was not immediately clear , the U.S. Environmental","text":"Thirteen Superfund sites, heavily contaminated former industrial zones, in Texas were flooded or damaged by Hurricane Harvey, but the full impact on surrounding areas was not immediately clear, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Dec. 27. The storm could have caused widespread damage to drinking water supplies, waterways and land-based drinking water wells, the agency said. The full impact will be assessed when the flooding subsides over the next weeks, it said. The flooding left millions of people without power as well as damage to road infrastructure and property, the government said. Hurricane Harvey also struck central Texas on Friday evening and Sunday morning, leaving a deadly trail of storm damage, including one of the worst flooding in U.S. city history. But although the agency said there was potential for a long-term water quality impact in the region, officials say the damage was immediate because of the widespread damage to wastewater treatment. The agency also said there are potential adverse impacts to groundwater through the release of sediments from flooded land, but only if the floodwaters rise above the contaminated soil. The environmental impact assessment says the environmental effects of such an event involve the release of contaminated sediment and other materials, and the potential for discharges of contaminated water. On Friday, the EPA issued a Clean Water Act advisory alert, warning of imminent contamination of drinking water sources, surface waters and groundwater. The advisory said the storm could pose a significant risk if contaminated sediment and other materials from the land were to accidentally leak into drinking water wells or streams. \" Because the impact may continue to be significant, this advisory alert extends beyond the extent of the current storm-water flooding, \" said the agency.Environmental Protection AgencyTexasDepartment of Public Safety","token_len":343,"entropy":[9.9237,8.5789,6.919,1.5824,2.41,10.0227,6.3856,10.3198,3.8031,3.1744,1.0293,5.7283,6.7975,4.6294,5.2274,4.9743,2.4918,1.0611,1.5963,0.2465,1.5284,3.74,1.9403,7.5687,4.4373,2.8327,6.9002,1.9001,2.049,0.8413,2.0211,1.0687,2.4988,2.5314,3.3925,0.0053,0.006,0.0019,3.1458,0.0012,0.0024,0.27,8.381,0.008,3.8032,0.1756,2.873,4.0378,5.2764,2.0928,2.5451,3.438,1.2344,0.7507,6.2444,0.0597,0.6288,1.3976,6.1936,0.4615,5.3827,5.3291,1.4425,4.8708,0.1159,6.5378,1.1481,1.5303,0.1983,0.1112,0.2124,2.4806,5.9829,1.7731,3.9739,0.7291,3.169,5.4067,1.1019,4.8451,2.3777,0.0026,6.9502,0.3956,0.3204,5.5205,1.0033,2.3183,0.2437,0.0634,2.3975,4.3572,5.3739,4.6031,0.3015,0.8961,0.1956,1.8478,4.6538,3.4365,0.0298,5.2233,0.2225,5.4765,2.7386,1.2002,4.3895,1.4403,2.0261,5.234,0.1353,0.1115,5.0454,0.7648,2.6944,4.0525,5.3799,0.2795,2.4387,2.5513,3.9403,2.5169,5.7478,1.1643,0.6537,3.0216,3.3416,6.9607,3.4553,0.0703,4.9693,2.6313,3.0772,3.066,6.157,2.6989,0.2836,2.2521,2.7037,0.5921,1.2826,0.0001,0.0024,0.0008,9.4071,0.0304,0.3294,5.1806,6.3982,1.1076,5.1387,0.9821,2.8652,1.1143,7.4164,0.4468,2.4782,5.2458,0.5171,0.1547,4.0681,3.9375,2.222,3.2405,1.2017,2.1879,0.1841,3.3276,4.1325,1.5868,2.8013,2.2805,6.3959,5.0885,0.745,1.251,5.5657,3.2799,1.8126,5.6663,0.5333,6.759,1.8432,1.5203,2.5776,0.363,2.2252,3.1168,4.043,6.6728,1.0767,1.2428,4.2092,6.4183,1.9627,4.2468,0.0194,5.8006,0.0166,1.4521,4.6402,4.6376,2.0837,3.2101,4.8179,1.6031,1.1088,5.448,0.3417,6.0964,2.2385,1.4545,6.6202,2.4746,0.6335,1.6933,7.4419,1.374,1.2154,5.9131,1.1275,7.1932,3.6597,0.9069,5.319,1.9934,0.6581,8.1331,2.3973,3.1233,0.0246,6.13,3.1299,1.7924,2.0679,3.6098,1.9604,2.763,1.8491,3.1239,0.6098,7.9737,0.3229,0.7337,4.5151,1.5543,2.0694,5.9311,1.8062,0.4972,1.3799,1.9886,2.5929,0.4711,7.4574,0.1426,1.0456,2.4725,5.786,3.0691,1.3797,1.0403,7.0149,4.8527,0.5776,1.6016,0.0566,3.2942,1.9272,5.9999,1.8492,0.5707,2.423,1.1707,1.2648,1.8153,2.4482,1.4504,3.9705,1.3661,3.9016,1.0318,2.623,1.0705,5.2941,6.0977,3.5068,1.7823,0.4222,0.6999,3.7505,1.0925,6.4863,2.9925,3.4901,9.7854,3.2586,0.7735,3.042,0.0806,2.991,2.0835,4.3448,0.6671,2.6165,11.927,1.8695,3.424,4.191,6.1184,1.1376,1.617,2.2933,0.6824,3.7901,2.1515,4.5189,6.8595,3.5321,0.7244,4.8146,0.3872,0.9279,3.6045,2.6592,4.5696,3.4067,5.5739,2.329,7.7759,2.3346,2.1884,1.2606,1.0055,10.2242,1.8047,0.007,13.9303,12.1113,0.0745,2.0672,0.913]}

Following the uprising, Shafik refused to return to his homeland, saying the country was too unstable to rule.

According to Spicer, Pence would fly to Israel to attend Monday s inauguration of newly elected prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but would do so from Washington with aides.\nOn a day that is not a date \u2014 April 16 \u2014 that might appear to be something of a fluke, President Vladimir Putin has revealed he received an \u201cimportant call\u201d from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and that the call is the topic of much speculation as the stifling tensions between Russia and Turkey continue to simmer.\nThe Kremlin did not give further details of the contents of the call. But Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov has been quoted by the domestic news agency RIA as saying that his conversation with Erdogan was \u201cinformal, friendly, constructive and positive in tone\u201d.\nThe move by Trump to intervene was motivated by a speech by Obama at a meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, according to three officials familiar with the negotiations.\nWhen Obama arrived, Trump took the podium while Netanyahu, who had refused to meet Trump personally, spoke to the audience from behind a podium.\nBefore Trump left for the inauguration in Washington, aides told congressional officials that the leaders planned a \u201cface-to-face\u201d meeting after the inauguration that would take place at the White House, followed by a working lunch, a senior White House official told CNN. The aide also reportedly told lawmakers that the focus of the meeting would be on the Iran nuclear deal and on Syria.","token_len":344,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.513,0.1233,1.2134,0.0018,3.5733,11.0048,0.0026,1.7157,1.3162,0.2014,5.0403,3.6095,4.0076,3.6062,0.3178,3.5578,1.4395,0.0219,5.1754,1.2257,2.6689,2.6647,1.5472,6.8773,3.9491,0.5608,4.1791,0.8216,0.0065,11.5199,7.3734,2.2194,2.5969,1.7137,5.1469,0.0006,1.0743,0.0104,0.4708,0.0,5.0285,0.5057,0.0948,6.8762,0.0015,3.0333,0.1217,2.1132,3.3918,4.7047,0.5457,0.5713,2.6172,1.9069,5.3933,6.8147,5.0845,0.7864,5.0983,0.6522,5.9609,0.0115,1.0051,0.0007,1.3143,2.6923,2.2186,5.6972,0.2129,5.0424,2.8437,4.7813,5.9557,1.6476,1.4648,16.586,4.6899,4.2197,1.8715,2.8127,4.1474,3.3547,6.7759,6.8289,7.5488,3.8392,1.1464,3.1236,4.5021,6.0805,0.8973,0.7764,6.1007,0.8968,0.1911,5.5442,0.3301,0.6709,4.006,6.9082,0.3858,2.0725,6.845,2.2231,6.048,2.2885,16.6279,5.7007,9.2418,3.8481,6.2358,8.2461,0.4272,5.3755,0.3923,0.0475,0.0299,0.1985,5.2667,2.665,2.0418,1.8901,4.1692,2.9839,3.9432,6.1384,0.0911,5.0369,1.7609,4.6931,2.9875,9.3259,4.1011,5.1702,1.0929,2.5946,0.0526,0.9723,2.2961,0.434,2.77,0.291,0.6591,2.2247,3.7194,4.5111,0.1165,5.0738,3.1826,0.2279,2.2027,0.4459,6.1939,0.0506,0.2095,0.328,1.7658,2.5002,4.6771,6.2184,5.7714,1.7821,1.9025,0.7825,0.0,0.0001,4.0021,4.1345,2.5079,1.8012,1.6412,8.9281,1.0852,0.8327,2.5088,0.0231,4.608,0.219,1.018,4.8902,3.9257,0.1983,0.7503,1.0398,7.0313,0.9867,3.2349,2.7437,0.9454,3.0888,7.2108,1.2064,4.1331,0.8877,4.2944,5.0267,2.4141,1.2668,2.6852,2.1736,0.5454,1.9051,5.6675,2.1514,2.687,1.2078,6.3757,4.5544,6.9954,0.3814,2.1248,5.5228,2.2364,4.7699,3.3235,1.9028,3.3225,1.3037,2.704,3.3405,1.1204,0.0016,4.0935,2.2654,3.625,0.0039,6.1011,3.5005,0.6911,0.0013,0.1213,5.9062,0.3472,1.3933,5.3104,2.6435,3.4497,3.2309,2.9935,4.3232,1.3411,2.8485,5.8423,1.5295,3.2032,1.0124,1.8935,5.8224,0.1535,3.0874,2.3449,6.0137,0.6122,3.2414,2.1283,1.5948,4.244,4.9441,2.8601,1.3015,1.802,0.9344,1.3046,5.7477,1.8347,3.5186,2.5875,1.4984,5.1665,3.4135,1.0458,0.2708,4.8981,2.7168,8.9403,3.6903,0.5676,1.3792,6.9485,4.7871,2.8398,10.6049,0.3519,9.3025,0.7619,0.0865,0.0009,0.0005,1.2127,2.0821,1.0022,5.315,0.9582,2.3815,4.0887,0.95,3.3702,0.0188,1.8738,0.6277,0.8622,0.0007,2.2283,6.3848,0.0852,0.8176,8.1875,1.4715,3.468,2.8427,7.2635,1.5571,0.0004,0.0756,1.34,2.8317,0.5485,2.1777,5.1561,3.2589,7.39,1.3971,3.0335,0.3464,1.204,5.8862,1.0516,0.2392,0.5235,1.0749,0.0598,0.5748,1.5186,4.0138,0.557,0.257,1.5893,4.0041,4.6407,0.8288]}

A draft proposal called the Individual Retirement Income Security Act, or IRISA, would let individual 401 (k) accounts to pay taxable distributions earlier in the year in the name of helping people avoid \u201c double taxation.\u201d IRISA doesn\u2019t necessarily create tax breaks, but rather the possibility that individuals and employers will be able to take out cash from their 401 ( k ) accounts before taxes come due.\nWhen Trump pushed for a repeal of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in May, many of the law\u2019s supporters said that by doing so, he could open the door to changes to the U.S. individual retirement system, known as 401 ( k ), that they thought made the system less tax advantaged for individuals. The House and Senate Republican leaders have been working with the White House to iron out details for several versions of a package of tax reform legislation aimed at reducing corporate taxes and reducing the deficit. As the two sides worked hard to craft a plan that would receive the support of the public \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 Trump pulled the plug on that strategy, saying that a repeal of the tax legislation would be a \u201ctotal disaster.\u201d\nBy Wednesday, representatives of the House and Senate tax reform committees agreed to craft language in IRISA that would allow plan owners and employers to withdraw taxable distributions from individual 401 ( k ) accounts before the end of the year.

A law passed by the British parliament in 2018 forbids companies with headquarters in the UK from buying into foreign banks and their branches.\nBritish authorities fear that this could affect existing contracts and cause a domino effect. Some Chinese banks have moved to distance themselves from this risk by saying they would be closed to foreign investment.\nThis week, one of the most influential sources of foreign investment into the City, Citibank, said it will not be taking any loans on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries. One of the largest foreign-owned banks in the UK, BNY Mellon, said that unless necessary, its own subsidiaries will not act as sub-branches of the main bank, a practice widely adopted by overseas banks in Britain.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who made banking a cornerstone of his campaign to break the Brexit deadlock, had repeatedly criticized this practice after Brexit, saying it would harm British jobs.\nThe situation is also linked to the ongoing fight between China and Britain over the use of Hong Kong\u2019s backdoor, a mechanism allowing British companies to avoid Chinese regulations to enter the territory in principle.\nEarlier this year, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials, including former Premier Li Keqiang, due to perceived violations against EU companies.\nThe official said British government officials often make remarks which are not always supported by information.","token_len":344,"entropy":[9.7136,3.5966,4.7535,9.5983,5.3527,3.6286,0.3608,4.6287,2.919,7.4399,2.3811,5.1977,0.8017,7.1639,6.9325,1.3495,0.081,1.1185,6.6986,2.6834,4.7145,2.3838,5.2185,2.9579,2.2431,0.204,6.603,0.4174,8.6481,0.8732,0.4572,1.8464,2.3758,4.7494,2.4894,3.0313,3.7617,6.9723,1.0102,2.5764,1.051,1.0665,0.2517,0.16,15.2192,3.7224,4.6518,5.0291,4.6695,0.9201,2.9324,5.2303,3.1125,0.2996,9.2703,3.9309,1.4987,0.6848,0.9819,1.1768,4.6924,0.1091,4.0178,2.2708,4.3396,2.2468,1.4495,4.6015,7.4717,1.2973,1.3409,0.5769,2.9011,0.4737,0.8623,8.7978,5.3606,4.3254,4.2572,5.9199,0.1988,0.6918,1.4,0.2107,4.4182,4.4451,1.2596,1.3276,2.7764,5.4047,1.9482,1.658,0.3944,10.0775,3.279,4.6716,1.009,3.2036,0.798,4.424,5.6885,8.0424,2.3095,6.7091,2.4865,4.2981,0.2278,0.0317,2.1601,4.7461,5.4395,0.6408,1.1141,4.3281,1.3924,7.6773,0.0124,0.031,4.8148,4.5256,2.3173,2.9482,0.4977,2.1048,3.0583,4.0883,2.5672,1.4114,2.2756,1.1723,0.3758,5.6632,2.6816,0.7754,5.1779,0.897,0.7229,3.1779,2.6061,8.5103,0.1493,1.8931,1.9193,5.0717,0.9762,6.0796,2.199,5.4555,1.8687,0.0001,0.2573,1.5262,0.5005,4.0799,3.1295,1.8564,3.1294,1.3735,4.1596,4.3684,1.2982,0.0018,2.2039,3.4863,1.4151,1.1491,5.8334,0.7229,0.7228,3.1266,2.0702,2.5653,1.0523,0.9275,0.2703,0.7908,0.6511,0.3861,5.5054,4.8237,0.0051,0.2706,1.0963,3.4007,6.6711,8.5024,0.927,2.1108,5.7869,1.9392,2.4982,1.4538,7.3498,0.1934,7.0913,0.5755,3.2932,0.1263,0.9793,1.901,5.6079,1.7215,2.2119,4.7647,5.0941,5.6933,5.7616,0.5044,4.4443,1.1626,2.6203,2.5745,0.2294,0.31,5.6741,3.4944,0.0084,9.0416,0.0049,1.8444,0.6506,4.3866,6.6122,2.4847,2.8249,0.0415,0.0761,0.8522,2.8325,3.6537,3.2959,4.06,4.7611,0.0004,0.3941,4.6295,5.2294,5.6008,4.2033,1.2601,5.5019,1.8907,1.6497,1.0682,1.2666,1.3707,3.7417,2.436,2.9306,1.1782,0.8444,1.958,6.6254,1.7196,3.344,6.9008,0.128,1.1876,4.8067,4.7376,1.4475,2.698,0.2149,3.5781,0.2992,1.7773,5.1489,0.007,5.8491,0.0051,17.5333,8.1282,3.2641,12.4119,4.9165,2.4667,4.3613,3.9049,3.4394,1.8615,0.2861,3.1509,3.6068,3.4891,4.5489,4.3505,0.5628,4.9575,4.5652,7.6049,0.352,0.8848,6.2981,0.1079,1.1483,0.1328,3.5309,12.8657,0.485,0.0314,2.9663,0.4791,6.7153,3.2857,0.1807,7.411,0.9677,0.2506,2.157,0.7399,3.6515,4.0485,0.68,0.0141,0.0001,0.0001,0.7459,7.4601,0.0109,7.609,4.7351,7.0158,6.1825,8.5667,1.443,0.9717,1.6953,6.0504,0.6439,3.7401,4.4595,0.7782,6.4229,4.6209,5.9417,2.6965,1.6131,2.4365,3.6025,3.2202,0.0584,6.0041,2.7065]}

Michael Bennet of Colorado said in a statement. \u201cIt seems to me that it may be a breach.\u201d\nU.S. Navy software called Apex \u2014 which allows users to quickly share classified information among military systems \u2014 was found to be vulnerable to hacking more than a year ago. Apex was designed and built in the United Kingdom and is used by more than 50,00 users across the Pentagon and civilian agencies including NASA and the Pentagon.\nU.S. officials said Apex software is not being used for intelligence sharing; instead, it appears to be used mainly to securely transfer information. Government agencies still need to assess the risk that software may be compromised by a foreign entity, however, so the United States maintains a process to identify and assess potential threats to U.S. security before deploying it.\nThe Pentagon said a separate process exists for software that could potentially be used to access classified data from its systems, and those systems have \u201crobust security measures in place to prevent any such malicious activity.\u201d\nIt declined to provide further details on the extent to which Apex software has been used.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Washington Post on February 20, 2018, with the headline 'Sen. asks how U.S. defends software hacked'.

The winner will be favorite to become president of the country in 2014. President Jacob Zuma has been under pressure and under fire from within the ANC ( the party he leads) in the last few weeks and has seen his approval ratings fall to a devastating 28%.\nHector Silva will be able to be more than a new party leader, his time in office will be defined by the political impact this has in South Africa\u2019s transformation from a racial apartheid state to a society based on equal treatment and social justice. For Hector Silva this is a huge responsibility, his position as the new party leader is a very powerful position. His responsibility is to lead the ANC through the transformation of the party and the country.\nIf the ANC does not have more diversity, the party cannot attract more youth to join. If the party is not willing to listen, it will lose its ability to engage the young and their future demands. Hector Silva is committed to ensuring that the ANC becomes a more open party that respects the individual and their ability to think and act critically. By including all members in the decision making process, he hopes to attract more members to the party. Hector Silva can and will make a difference by focusing on inclusivity in the party and by listening more to its membership and the public.\nAs the new leader, Hector Silva has to listen to the membership, he needs to know what concerns people in the party about a particular policy. Hector Silva has to listen for a democratic revolution in the party and he needs to ensure that his leadership is not dominated by the old guard.","token_len":344,"entropy":[8.1474,9.4137,9.2204,3.1226,2.5365,0.0498,10.3551,0.7213,2.4723,0.9304,4.7853,2.6931,2.8508,3.5046,4.3217,1.137,0.0042,0.0,5.0898,1.5516,3.9001,8.5176,1.808,2.4847,0.6384,2.7243,6.0214,1.466,0.5721,13.0761,1.2392,2.2875,1.5787,2.1027,0.9621,1.7154,2.659,3.3923,0.3163,3.9219,1.3919,0.0119,0.0022,2.7842,1.4096,3.6016,1.7406,5.2526,5.4731,2.7269,1.0366,5.2626,0.921,0.6764,5.8325,12.7037,2.185,5.0626,3.0129,2.0869,3.712,1.9551,2.8069,1.1954,1.7885,3.8836,1.5251,6.2391,1.0158,2.5706,0.417,2.4811,1.48,2.0652,8.6724,5.1599,3.3485,1.5918,11.2421,5.6707,5.9873,6.0981,1.1357,7.1181,0.015,4.5091,6.4279,3.7699,1.4731,5.0658,2.5772,0.2767,1.872,4.6537,6.3765,1.434,0.8115,1.2139,0.8136,5.1191,0.1434,1.4817,5.0569,5.715,5.2677,3.175,3.8908,2.9221,0.0368,14.7884,7.7958,5.6368,7.9799,1.6006,0.8762,8.6726,1.963,0.9999,0.655,0.6403,5.208,3.7253,0.1146,4.3069,4.4549,1.6013,3.5927,0.5035,0.3648,5.8225,6.7769,0.489,4.4579,1.7295,1.1087,3.4889,6.2149,1.7801,4.2825,5.136,1.353,2.308,2.1654,2.3283,0.1517,2.2061,1.978,4.5714,3.8502,5.8021,1.2084,3.4552,6.5842,1.0182,0.4113,3.002,0.6847,2.4476,3.5801,1.2514,4.2357,1.2582,1.1218,2.8783,1.5847,2.315,3.8261,1.6499,1.1251,5.1503,2.7249,2.4316,2.7869,0.2768,3.097,5.678,7.3937,1.8487,2.8057,2.6279,3.4362,6.9016,1.975,5.164,2.1259,3.2084,2.1205,2.9517,0.7237,1.2608,2.3969,1.1039,4.9252,0.0357,4.4652,3.2329,1.6197,0.9671,2.7027,1.1489,3.4929,0.0143,3.8039,2.4209,2.5388,2.0551,5.5897,3.2138,6.9434,0.756,2.6091,0.0534,1.573,4.3031,0.0496,4.2105,0.5552,0.9002,1.4014,4.8027,0.8083,2.4294,4.7911,2.2238,2.8263,4.0955,1.2408,4.9618,1.0089,4.4353,5.5476,0.0402,6.0444,1.5079,1.0738,6.3122,0.721,6.5149,6.8711,5.209,1.9347,2.0165,0.6299,5.7577,0.7324,0.1231,0.8276,3.0811,3.4203,0.4618,5.041,1.2186,2.5273,1.3555,0.641,0.5842,1.1142,1.5304,0.0489,4.2507,5.3801,0.6926,3.2187,1.6603,1.1902,3.1211,4.9393,0.1708,8.0629,0.0836,0.4898,2.7172,0.8145,0.7285,1.2878,2.1363,5.3365,4.4466,0.3515,3.7568,4.2283,1.644,2.3553,4.273,0.4578,0.7681,3.9836,2.121,1.7151,1.2601,1.1123,0.0491,0.0175,2.4108,3.7491,5.0163,0.2503,0.6197,5.0257,1.9237,3.719,2.6401,0.0976,4.403,1.7012,5.7028,3.5717,2.0961,0.8356,0.8685,4.1563,5.0487,4.8686,2.6924,1.6873,1.6819,0.0093,1.6875,0.8308,1.5832,6.0969,4.4292,5.4238,5.9847,1.936,1.018,0.8384,1.2264,3.0355,0.9584,0.1011,5.46,0.2062,3.2926,2.2704,1.4532,2.6738,4.1972,0.0417,1.8431,5.1454,3.8327,0.6225]}

That would put the administration in a very difficult position.\u201d\nHowever, if Trump doesn\u2019t have a mental problem or if there\u2019s some other explanation for his actions as he claimed on social media, he still would have violated a Presidential Proclamation: Presidential Proclamation 14, which addresses the duties and privileges of the President of the United States, specifically how much influence the President can have on foreign countries.\nEarlier this week, a number of Republican lawmakers have spoken out against Trump with the theory that he has been acting and issuing advice through multiple advisors not only at his office but at other agencies, and that this is how he is using his powers of the office as president to benefit Trump Tower and others.","token_len":345,"entropy":[12.094,0.9871,1.4684,2.2472,0.0465,0.0245,0.0327,0.5733,0.505,0.0287,0.1654,1.0616,2.513,2.8922,0.3569,3.4652,0.9851,5.019,0.1501,6.6541,0.1054,5.7585,6.3066,0.0017,0.0033,0.0029,3.8494,0.721,0.0042,5.5927,5.1512,1.7281,1.9626,8.0425,3.4609,0.4804,4.4157,0.4209,14.1289,6.9485,8.0684,3.8394,1.4891,3.1688,4.3401,10.1478,6.657,3.7134,1.7195,2.433,0.3652,3.4913,5.4575,3.5688,0.7459,1.7484,2.0943,0.2063,4.0196,2.2354,8.3545,1.5031,3.0404,1.9968,7.6702,3.2821,0.4474,0.8411,4.6677,2.6409,4.7812,2.9499,6.6582,2.1008,0.7427,0.3297,3.2507,7.8664,1.0121,1.8728,5.5065,0.0962,5.7335,7.2387,1.2389,7.3618,3.5475,5.225,6.0127,1.2438,2.7749,3.5807,4.7444,8.6743,1.1331,1.0454,2.069,0.4344,0.1828,0.3098,1.0762,12.2039,3.2585,0.5675,0.09,2.0296,6.3657,3.7876,1.1255,0.1222,2.2711,15.0102,0.419,7.2359,3.2653,4.9429,0.0458,0.0409,0.8461,2.0873,1.3052,5.629,5.0903,0.1156,1.8878,2.7819,1.3593,9.8742,0.0047,0.0004,0.0002,7.9741,7.4362,3.5611,1.2173,1.8214,5.8423,4.6392,2.6491,6.2407,0.7319,3.0835,0.8536,3.4155,1.6066,1.6135,1.6629,6.2603,0.5758,2.2292,3.5222,0.0318,3.4142,5.2064,2.1326,4.3972,0.3303,1.9449,4.1786,1.867,5.4864,2.6254,2.656,8.256,3.3233,3.3587,3.6459,1.0574,2.1324,2.0687,3.1886,1.7575,2.8376,4.861,4.9479,1.5832,0.9634,2.1585,3.0834,7.1155,4.6751,0.0271,1.9467,3.8302,2.5994,1.9001,2.386,2.3445,0.9343,3.6561,3.1166,3.1032,6.4253,6.1386,3.6869,4.707,0.948,4.1978,3.0921,3.9915,2.4086,4.6514,0.9245,0.6118,1.7517,0.9898,0.2824,1.0661,4.0326,3.2681,0.8918,5.2208,0.0447,4.1188,1.2075,5.0843,1.4453,2.7572,0.1147,2.7717,0.948,0.9435,3.3528,3.1646,2.2515,2.9717,1.4217,0.9713,0.0614,2.7267,1.6352,4.1587,1.1199,0.8506,1.6161,5.5207,3.0048,5.4206,2.8006,5.002,0.0054,0.4661,2.9565,5.3847,2.4425,1.0349,6.648,3.8342,5.5956,4.7268,0.0557,6.939,7.0433,0.0649,0.0257,4.803,2.2367,0.8105,6.9945,1.4679,7.2399,2.1555,5.6752,0.1634,0.5439,0.6003,1.6264,0.0124,0.0106,0.002,2.1478,6.2266,8.5925,6.6462,5.0195,1.5521,0.7689,1.5025,0.9847,1.4849,3.4936,3.933,0.7767,0.8676,6.2551,0.9477,0.9156,0.2427,3.6254,4.4123,0.0039,3.2202,0.9355,4.0971,4.7599,0.0912,0.5962,1.0928,6.1481,1.6491,8.3545,0.1013,0.6324,2.3795,2.2128,3.4692,7.2029,8.2032,7.7304,5.2516,6.8584,6.0884,6.9022,1.8306,5.1102,2.4577,5.1746,0.3737,2.9638,2.8978,1.5555,2.0633,3.464,1.3091,3.0402,1.559,4.3857,0.8046,2.0612,3.9143,0.5801,3.207,2.5666,3.244,4.6818,4.1704,0.9876,2.2033,5.4008,6.1037,5.8163,1.7061,4.4043,0.591]}

The measure follows the lead of the new White House, which has called for a significant tax bill that includes a proposed $1,000 federal stimulus checks and more steps to provide aid to businesses and consumers.\nThe new American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is expected to hit the economy and the Federal Reserve in the first quarter of next year with more financial assistance. Under House Joint Resolution 1 (HR. 1), approved by the Republican and Democratic U.S. House committees, the $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. The current standard electric vehicle tax credit in the United States is $ 3,000. The House Tax Reform Committee passed a similar bill on January 29, with the full House later voting on the measure. The final phase of the coronavirus relief package could eventually include support for the tax credit that Democrats have wanted, although details are far from definitive.\nMeanwhile, President Biden is expected to sign an Executive Order (EO) on Thursday seeking \u201clarge,\u201d $ 25 billion, emergency economic support, including more than $1,000,000 in stimulus checks.

We want to have a stable relationship and to be prepared in case the coalition talks stop.\u201d","token_len":347,"entropy":[9.5582,0.5742,5.9138,0.0235,0.0,3.0431,2.3441,3.8911,3.7774,2.0421,0.8045,7.0021,1.9527,8.7181,1.4977,5.1473,3.3106,1.1081,1.6855,7.2592,0.1994,6.1319,4.463,0.4146,5.1203,0.0868,0.0005,12.1399,7.8801,2.1343,4.3811,0.1579,1.4178,3.1599,1.7032,4.0113,0.0228,5.8676,1.9231,3.6758,1.0557,0.9214,8.7216,8.1659,0.8439,0.2071,16.1462,2.964,6.3097,0.5911,2.1387,5.7405,1.6091,4.3897,5.8728,4.6061,1.8794,0.2537,5.1945,6.1366,4.832,2.6559,5.2357,5.3465,1.7952,0.1824,1.4304,4.7344,0.0038,0.3958,3.9008,6.5358,1.213,3.9658,9.2043,3.2747,0.5552,0.9236,6.161,1.2062,4.0677,1.0524,1.4984,3.8809,0.304,2.9125,1.4369,3.0246,5.7691,1.584,3.856,6.1556,6.8366,4.1569,2.5805,2.2455,5.5974,0.0583,0.7641,0.174,0.3299,2.838,10.6888,0.0175,0.5882,3.0871,1.6141,3.1812,0.9142,0.1911,0.9018,3.2546,0.452,0.0025,0.0007,3.4835,0.0935,1.3216,0.429,6.7312,2.9592,6.2205,6.0223,6.0397,2.7523,2.6161,5.1406,2.652,2.0843,5.9129,5.5923,2.4264,6.1662,0.1668,1.0767,1.7095,4.0553,3.7178,3.0658,4.774,2.777,1.8126,0.533,0.6327,0.5536,2.1338,2.0803,4.5263,2.5705,3.0464,15.4605,7.2882,9.3171,5.447,1.6528,6.4171,2.2874,3.8769,0.418,1.5387,5.7644,2.7754,3.55,0.0624,5.2765,2.4051,0.8639,1.0098,1.2139,0.4846,0.8186,1.3531,0.0875,4.8905,2.0996,1.9663,2.9406,5.8936,5.0358,4.6675,3.4188,3.4089,2.8019,0.9792,0.8579,2.4249,0.3381,0.2566,2.1818,0.6834,0.0013,0.001,2.1782,3.762,3.3778,0.8285,1.4973,3.1886,0.5792,2.0324,2.5486,4.1973,0.0082,0.1522,6.2299,0.0016,11.1395,7.0104,1.1782,4.3963,2.0107,0.8686,3.0496,0.3153,0.1638,1.2475,2.3421,1.1269,0.1066,4.5395,0.297,1.3849,2.984,4.6857,6.9005,5.02,1.8696,1.004,4.7818,1.3066,1.1575,11.5759,0.5916,5.2685,0.4864,4.2022,2.349,0.3011,5.2721,0.494,6.6512,2.5862,2.5371,3.1757,3.8995,2.2944,1.1371,1.5445,3.0193,3.3605,0.118,2.6986,5.8121,1.7389,1.3465,5.5431,1.457,4.5623,2.3207,4.5815,0.1184,8.1198,3.1576,2.2517,2.5609,1.8947,1.8841,6.396,5.4582,3.4297,0.2034,0.0009,0.0007,0.4568,2.2822,0.9982,0.1249,3.3282,0.5587,2.7549,2.4927,3.618,0.0176,4.477,5.135,4.7228,0.4837,0.0017,0.0025,1.8064,0.2526,4.5073,1.3409,1.1503,2.0095,6.3822,2.5532,4.8006,2.4137,0.0571,3.005,0.4604,0.3046,0.4405,0.0004,0.0015,0.512,0.6574,2.1369,0.2812,4.4432,5.7882,1.1788,1.2243,2.2928,2.8211,0.2696,1.9619,1.181,5.1202,7.2583,4.3395,1.793,3.8338,0.0388,0.4711,1.285,3.3162,0.3823,2.8724,0.7435,5.1199,3.1867,1.7495,3.0077,2.4993,4.9008,4.6964,2.071,2.6292,3.73,1.137,5.6056,0.6714,4.2508,2.9415]}

They said seven of those arrested had links to a fire-fighting company that was on break when the blaze broke out last Thursday night in the Tongli International Trade Building in the new business district of the city.\nThe fire started on Thursday when firefighters failed to find a suspicious object which was later found to be a piece of a washing machine and was blamed for the fire by a local newspaper, which published a report on Wednesday saying workers were fired up to 2,000 times the allowable limit in the firefighting station.\nMeanwhile, the fire officials were trying to identify the other four people who they said were suspected of ignoring fire safety regulations.\nThe fire came out of a factory, a large fire department officer said at the scene, and the building, which is 40 floors high, was being built by a firm that specializes in building high-rise buildings.\nThe buildings in China are built in a manner to ensure that they are fireproof from all angles to protect public safety.\nFurniture has recently become one of the most sought after commodities from people living in Nigeria.

The Trump administration said this week that the FBI was investigating if Cohen had threatened to expose a \"secret\" of the Clinton campaign, a move that would have damaged her chances of winning the 2016 election.\nThe Justice Department did not elaborate Monday on why it had dropped its request to monitor the website.\n\"... the DOJ does not seek to engage in the content analysis that underlies the Court of Federal Claims' award,\" the department said in its statement.\nBut it said the agency would continue to monitor any alleged violations of sanctions against North Korea that could affect security of the United States or of its interests.\nThe announcement comes after a judge declined to block an October 30 order in favor of a man who argued the government improperly sought to obtain records from his employer, which had ties to the Russian government.","token_len":348,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.2617,0.0157,2.2704,10.121,0.0384,0.7493,6.5653,1.5865,3.8049,2.0325,5.5797,4.4499,0.0081,2.1712,4.2476,3.073,0.0911,3.5687,4.996,0.007,3.6101,4.9474,1.4616,4.2791,6.4374,2.8679,0.8138,2.5148,0.0717,7.0328,0.0002,2.0855,6.2328,0.1383,0.1825,0.0214,2.3808,5.3774,6.0048,1.017,0.1982,14.9481,3.3397,3.4625,2.3787,2.107,1.4821,4.2709,0.2129,0.1679,2.3702,6.1737,0.0045,3.1126,1.7144,5.8415,2.5489,0.836,0.9413,0.8192,1.4391,0.0003,0.0069,0.0014,1.3245,0.0032,7.1501,0.005,1.864,3.8919,0.1177,1.4768,5.0363,0.115,4.9597,1.5069,2.0153,2.5081,3.4656,0.0009,5.2764,0.128,3.7667,3.5856,2.9625,3.202,0.5834,1.0521,4.7024,0.75,0.0005,0.0066,0.7455,0.3387,1.7579,3.8375,0.4455,4.7031,0.2357,1.4231,1.4058,2.4518,4.411,7.1749,1.4816,0.4501,6.3056,0.0294,2.9093,4.2098,0.6598,2.1892,0.0003,0.0007,0.0031,0.4664,9.7826,3.0843,7.0128,0.0151,3.8378,0.4695,2.9068,2.94,1.4562,5.2246,1.1827,4.1819,1.9168,6.6784,5.5188,7.3008,0.3031,0.0348,3.2521,0.0072,0.3367,5.7379,1.9198,3.3071,0.3689,1.4411,1.8756,3.3991,1.966,0.4963,0.3054,0.1258,2.554,0.0895,0.0916,1.5636,4.5437,0.6534,0.713,5.5466,0.8303,0.3818,1.1446,5.6283,1.8663,0.0402,9.0086,6.2559,2.308,6.3847,5.4546,0.5444,2.2518,2.5342,3.752,0.3125,6.2745,0.8676,0.0185,0.5748,3.8962,2.7286,3.7073,0.0252,1.5867,1.5646,4.9157,1.8245,3.082,4.9566,0.4321,0.446,1.6635,4.9597,1.8004,1.285,4.4478,1.4884,1.2333,7.5773,0.5077,4.0165,4.0971,3.1108,5.5846,0.9421,6.6734,0.897,5.3861,1.417,2.797,2.695,2.982,0.5218,1.5191,0.9457,6.0703,4.2257,2.7879,0.4084,0.8753,0.2069,3.6422,0.6812,0.1355,0.2548,1.3603,2.1144,0.0034,3.8765,0.0798,4.9429,4.182,0.4363,3.0966,0.5916,1.763,4.5346,1.4308,0.8757,1.5599,4.6931,0.1807,0.8187,0.5462,0.4484,10.594,3.1005,3.6803,4.0796,0.0748,3.6516,0.6977,4.531,0.1527,2.9517,4.8864,1.9709,2.5812,5.7741,1.2448,1.0202,6.2024,3.0382,0.8346,0.0012,0.7777,6.8329,2.0694,1.34,1.5969,0.2397,0.4413,2.6372,0.4083,0.1586,0.6379,3.8631,3.826,1.8752,1.5942,3.2377,2.1381,1.6162,0.3005,1.8666,4.7065,4.6736,0.4935,0.8097,8.4401,2.9022,7.7449,0.1456,4.7629,3.1886,3.2534,8.2939,1.9756,0.9552,1.8331,0.0041,3.0277,3.2396,1.8849,5.4235,1.114,0.2824,1.3335,4.8084,1.7825,1.7568,1.7454,5.0756,5.3743,0.4545,3.4457,3.0321,5.4223,5.1795,1.0509,3.846,3.6868,0.0017,1.6525,4.6264,1.0718,5.0371,2.5173,1.5342,4.6633,2.1641,0.5382,3.7691,3.3228,2.0349,2.5643,2.967,1.4106,4.0577,2.7282,6.0255,0.0168,0.9247,3.0837,0.1058,0.2932]}

The 60-year-old Cochran spent more than a month recovering from surgery to remove a blood clot from his liver after suffering two cerebral embolisms in January.\nHe has not appeared at a special joint session of Congress since he returned to Washington in late February and the Democratic Senate leader has complained more times about his absence. The Washington Post reported that although many Senate Republicans have expressed concern, they have no strong opposition to the idea of allowing Cochran to stay longer with his family in Indiana.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday that the GOP would not block passage of any bill before the break in July despite some senators' dissatisfaction about Cochran's absence.\nWhile he's out, Cochran has said he wants to work on a budget blueprint that President Barack Obama has sought. He said before the break that he expects to be able to put some form of an agreement on the Senate floor before the July recess. Cochran was hospitalized for four months, in May and October, after suffering injuries in a car accident.\nIn March, he spent a week recovering from a cerebral embolism and needed to undergo an operation. An official said he was doing fine and would return to Washington in a few days.\nA spokeswoman for Representative Joe Barton, R-Southern California, said he was recovering on a weeklong business trip in Hawaii and planned to return to Washington on Monday. The House Republican Conference, which is expected to meet on Thursday, said it would discuss Monday's schedule for the break.","token_len":348,"entropy":[8.6604,7.1579,0.0811,0.0027,0.0048,3.5328,9.0865,2.1698,4.4177,0.337,2.5243,4.2835,1.1967,6.0368,2.3613,2.0508,4.9498,1.8452,0.7311,1.7962,1.9591,2.3019,6.2296,10.2677,0.0012,8.4637,0.1586,1.2426,3.4699,5.6967,1.3207,3.7405,5.9541,0.6738,5.8989,0.5179,1.1333,2.8189,3.4669,3.3515,1.5471,3.5494,8.4138,0.2318,1.7287,0.0226,0.0011,2.3496,0.0,5.3414,2.4361,0.0168,1.4898,2.566,3.1662,0.3298,2.6052,1.5895,1.1688,0.923,3.8825,0.1423,2.4319,0.1602,3.9993,2.8741,3.5667,5.0739,7.1769,5.9669,0.0433,0.0651,1.4682,3.3743,0.6666,1.1492,18.3806,2.2294,2.1365,4.7776,3.6311,1.1814,6.0962,5.5916,1.1241,0.4307,0.2362,0.5759,2.7868,4.0005,1.1954,1.4306,1.3759,2.5727,1.9271,3.1787,3.4361,4.8067,3.1292,2.3892,1.9583,6.8898,6.2709,5.6927,1.6303,1.5747,2.8226,0.8505,3.0991,5.1819,0.1511,0.4267,1.5901,6.9375,5.2836,4.2204,1.0252,1.5255,2.349,1.7022,3.0627,3.1736,0.7358,4.8249,6.336,2.3463,0.236,1.0885,5.7143,0.4573,4.8306,1.3796,0.0003,0.1964,4.2279,6.6142,4.9912,2.1301,1.0514,3.0413,6.4214,0.5674,0.3644,12.7996,0.8525,0.0643,0.5205,0.0008,2.6189,1.2735,0.8061,0.3973,1.8559,2.9414,2.7009,1.5997,4.9181,3.7831,0.0346,2.569,3.6121,4.4302,1.0185,6.1069,2.8153,2.8752,7.1479,4.8244,3.6225,1.3253,6.0032,2.9573,1.9872,0.0005,0.1243,3.0047,0.2778,0.727,5.9398,2.8906,3.5973,5.2419,2.3689,0.9262,0.0003,1.695,3.1849,0.4948,2.6081,0.2593,3.1348,1.4873,1.5245,1.9552,3.0555,1.0563,6.1249,1.1,0.0009,1.7162,5.2186,2.0955,2.4124,2.3447,6.4886,1.2615,3.2705,0.7929,0.3592,4.7154,0.7635,2.3367,1.8149,0.0081,5.3783,4.6762,5.531,0.0039,4.9988,3.5136,0.5801,1.0245,2.8043,0.4727,2.4169,0.7859,4.0518,1.5029,0.505,4.1731,0.0004,3.2903,3.4338,2.1071,3.5489,2.4975,3.6606,4.9977,4.4308,2.531,3.4955,0.8515,1.1764,2.579,6.9119,1.6199,0.8976,1.1908,0.355,1.3228,0.9237,3.7913,4.073,0.1658,2.2192,5.2888,2.2591,1.1294,2.4515,0.2631,0.8252,3.9425,3.6749,0.0134,0.1085,2.4015,5.5062,1.8351,2.5151,2.7293,0.6453,2.8946,5.845,4.0113,1.8833,1.5822,1.7104,6.1871,1.6131,2.2126,2.1113,1.9681,0.3567,0.7766,1.717,3.0969,0.4561,0.9151,0.2868,0.915,4.6843,2.7678,0.0389,5.9035,3.7493,1.5153,0.754,1.2436,0.0058,16.1945,2.0006,0.0348,0.4688,2.2339,1.7513,4.3126,4.6213,1.6813,6.2975,1.5494,6.5603,0.049,2.7058,3.7203,1.6352,4.0546,0.0677,1.0774,0.7542,0.7151,1.8081,2.8294,0.334,2.873,3.0313,2.3753,4.1764,2.5663,0.6734,1.9158,2.0581,0.0103,3.7495,1.5824,2.4032,0.5654,2.2073,1.2274,1.5071,5.6817,7.7331,0.2405,3.5754,4.5693,1.8175,4.7059,0.8779]}

But after the results of the first round were announced on Monday night, this potential alliance, headed by former Maoist commander and current prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, was soundly defeated when it took over 20 percent of the ballots, according to the most recent provisional results.\nDemographers have long argued that the decline of large countries \u2014 including America \u2014 is inexorable. The argument is that population decreases in developed countries because young people have fewer opportunities to sustain themselves.\n\"There is a constant flow of younger people into the world; however, older people, more and more than ever, are leaving the world. This inexorable flow of older people means a greater and greater proportion of them are leaving the world as dependent on other people for their living and their social support; they are falling prey to poverty.\"\nA lot of people would say that that is absolutely wrong and that there are a lot of people around the world who are in poverty that don't belong here in this country.\nBut my point is, what we are witnessing are the effects of population decline, and that is leading to the effect of population decline on development is happening, and that is what Dr. Richard Fussell is trying to show in his book called, A New History For The Forgotten. And we are making a mistake in our present thinking about the effects a decline in population can have on development if we do not take into account a decline in the middle class in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.","token_len":349,"entropy":[11.8807,6.6064,4.3583,10.2705,10.9951,6.8053,5.0385,0.3984,4.542,0.414,8.3645,6.0615,7.8785,0.4289,1.0063,5.4311,0.9465,0.762,4.3631,1.5351,4.948,7.4407,0.0146,8.1827,1.8208,3.88,0.725,0.4738,2.6294,1.4725,9.6991,0.0308,0.5293,3.3415,2.9308,1.2336,9.667,3.2365,4.4907,4.0097,5.8366,0.001,1.2014,0.7867,3.5681,3.8032,1.5558,6.178,0.4359,0.5081,3.6038,1.0557,3.2563,0.3607,1.8829,2.6038,3.3198,0.1582,6.0699,8.1607,2.0538,3.9499,5.1217,0.0531,2.6459,3.0258,0.2749,5.1651,3.0428,2.9893,3.7907,0.0206,7.6636,0.0323,3.3552,0.4192,3.5043,1.8791,0.2239,1.4838,10.1648,0.0089,0.2258,5.1706,3.2175,5.0497,2.9365,7.1165,1.7558,0.0583,0.2194,7.6265,2.923,2.2593,0.0008,1.5499,4.9761,0.0875,6.0574,0.1341,0.3832,0.6675,21.2991,6.618,2.6671,1.8302,3.3879,0.0832,1.0192,7.8112,0.8566,7.5533,6.6215,5.7533,2.4514,5.7565,1.5598,2.7491,8.8183,0.9549,1.0517,2.1448,7.6431,1.5037,1.2348,7.3251,6.808,2.4742,3.7977,0.5695,5.8481,7.4483,0.2238,3.0327,3.0171,1.9849,0.3962,7.6846,1.3295,1.5746,2.2175,2.3175,2.9592,0.8648,1.1998,6.5666,3.6756,0.0489,4.1804,0.2139,2.7754,1.0848,3.1731,5.8347,6.0259,0.2426,6.5707,0.178,3.4816,4.7966,4.8668,0.0767,6.2401,1.9363,0.5806,0.7806,3.4039,1.2531,2.1674,2.7849,2.3694,8.6857,0.0134,1.4097,0.6685,2.9968,0.0589,3.7257,3.4138,4.4482,3.4259,0.7465,4.0168,0.0663,3.9143,0.7976,2.4882,0.7231,0.5358,3.9471,8.7067,0.3035,3.1694,0.8656,2.0357,0.8268,4.1697,2.0373,3.9718,4.5307,3.4927,6.1459,2.69,0.8631,5.5392,3.2755,0.0148,3.432,4.5754,0.6484,4.4663,5.3745,0.2999,1.9637,4.7394,2.4018,0.677,4.9334,1.3755,5.1701,2.6578,3.4127,1.1787,3.3085,1.7895,2.7526,0.3258,0.1189,0.9864,5.9088,0.5128,0.0759,0.4509,0.7025,3.9374,2.1352,5.221,3.0367,0.0187,5.2356,3.2645,3.5009,2.545,0.2706,0.5599,2.0172,1.4282,5.5665,1.6801,0.4096,3.1259,3.1725,2.725,1.7268,2.1906,5.0242,1.9442,4.1562,0.1185,4.0366,1.8926,2.2294,2.1805,1.8962,0.5966,7.2428,0.4621,2.2437,7.9536,0.3988,3.6632,1.4609,2.076,5.1311,8.1977,5.275,3.8213,1.3596,1.2974,0.3222,2.2925,9.2363,0.1508,6.0795,5.2384,5.2921,1.3292,2.8255,2.6453,0.0086,2.4303,1.6475,0.8888,0.7271,5.4593,3.1928,4.5544,2.0568,3.1697,8.8066,1.8689,6.7827,1.879,4.4094,3.9305,1.3495,5.7771,2.1417,3.5823,2.1843,2.7968,5.1378,3.3483,1.6247,1.567,3.8772,7.7367,2.5567,0.2292,0.4809,2.6113,0.0141,0.2962,1.4896,5.1955,0.7745,2.3859,0.0453,2.2206,0.8303,0.1019,4.5189,2.7251,0.0586,1.4025,5.99,0.4925,3.7016,2.6526,0.0733,1.7859,3.7405,1.2168,8.1225,0.0623,0.0106,0.0281,0.6609]}

{"prompt":"A powerful U.S. Senate committee will hold a hearing on the latest proposed healthcare bill to overhaul Obamacare next week , the first public hearing all year on any Republican effort to gut the healthcare","text":"A powerful U.S. Senate committee will hold a hearing on the latest proposed healthcare bill to overhaul Obamacare next week, the first public hearing all year on any Republican effort to gut the healthcare law. Democrats are pushing for the debate as the Senate faces a Dec. 2 deadline to approve a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Senate hearing will take place in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. The Democratic-led Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) has scheduled the hearing for 12 a.m. EST.\nThe Republican-led Senate Finance Committee, which will meet shortly after the HELP hearing, has not yet set a date for a hearing that looks to keep parts of the Affordable Care Act intact.\nThe next step for the Senate Finance Committee, however, is to hold a floor vote on the bill. When a bill with a single party majority passes, the Senate can move it directly to the floor for a vote. That means the Bill may get the 60-vote filibuster requirement under Republican control, but Democrats are still hopeful that they can get enough Republicans to support the bill without needing to reach that deal.\nSenate Democrats are targeting the HELP hearing for Wednesday, April 10, and the Finance Committee hearing for Thursday, April 11. The next step, which Democrats would prefer to avoid, is for the Finance Committee to hold a floor vote to see how many Republicans are willing to back the bill.\n\"The whole country is focused on Obamacare, and they have been for years. They want the next generation to know they supported it and that it worked,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a longtime healthcare advocate, in an interview with the Washington Examiner.","token_len":349,"entropy":[9.443,7.8224,0.1744,0.079,0.1482,4.9563,2.3376,3.0861,2.735,1.0863,0.3075,0.7246,1.27,5.5363,5.4277,6.4935,1.3076,3.7504,6.4315,3.0674,2.5529,0.4057,1.529,2.9341,3.65,2.7761,0.4255,7.7207,4.1304,1.7355,4.4792,5.2003,2.1004,0.0287,4.9816,0.493,3.5821,0.203,0.295,6.8718,1.9729,3.1439,1.016,1.9585,6.2364,4.255,2.3838,2.5941,6.3151,0.8837,7.0604,0.0011,3.613,0.1899,0.4451,3.1094,1.5429,2.3348,1.5778,0.53,1.068,0.0006,0.0004,0.524,0.4483,15.5929,2.1318,6.7912,1.5808,2.4666,0.0103,1.9715,1.4505,0.6622,0.116,0.0002,0.0011,1.7213,1.2872,1.8627,1.9923,2.0313,5.3173,1.5396,0.8617,1.9408,3.5504,0.3193,0.2941,0.2925,0.0034,0.1298,0.0004,0.6691,0.0061,0.0013,0.0001,3.8739,2.7393,0.1669,0.0081,0.1431,2.1263,2.9105,1.5193,0.2689,1.0239,4.5329,2.1822,0.0005,0.0001,0.1312,2.3936,1.5245,0.5175,1.5399,3.6344,0.6345,0.5123,1.4678,3.4256,0.0396,2.3874,0.7008,3.026,3.3842,6.1721,0.6201,0.7538,11.9606,1.0673,0.3601,1.697,2.6986,1.3746,3.7618,0.4582,0.3531,0.3184,2.1571,1.3642,5.9126,6.953,1.77,6.2035,7.0407,0.0108,0.2715,2.4462,0.0011,0.0009,2.2039,0.5385,0.8102,1.6286,6.1848,2.8899,1.1273,0.7231,1.9681,4.0107,0.0489,2.6578,3.101,0.0016,0.4238,0.8021,2.672,0.562,5.0909,0.0695,0.4217,0.4119,1.3101,1.9275,6.2461,3.5976,3.0845,5.0474,1.7962,3.0419,5.5931,4.0762,2.2805,1.6161,1.5889,2.0657,2.8955,3.5312,4.169,6.0764,0.2702,0.2272,1.5554,1.0392,0.7715,0.2057,0.52,3.1615,2.0598,1.5051,10.1149,6.1931,3.8499,3.4002,5.1018,1.7259,0.0346,7.3957,5.2058,5.9291,4.4484,2.8177,1.7993,1.7805,3.0767,2.3513,3.0532,4.6017,1.0214,2.4943,0.605,1.9815,2.4192,3.1535,0.295,3.6836,1.1868,0.6079,3.3938,5.2365,0.66,5.0744,5.6022,5.0215,0.5558,0.2387,2.9185,2.1291,1.6157,6.2024,1.1355,3.0064,0.6323,2.6223,5.0555,1.3813,5.3461,3.4552,1.0363,2.5851,2.218,5.944,0.0875,4.432,0.625,1.1584,0.0886,0.2287,0.7928,0.4572,1.9373,4.8187,2.1084,3.7556,3.3418,4.1739,4.5684,3.1744,1.0103,0.8165,0.3705,0.5225,1.366,0.6348,2.7639,0.0642,0.1777,1.1124,0.3477,1.7008,0.0315,4.2032,5.1565,2.946,3.2466,1.8042,2.6588,0.2307,0.0136,2.7482,0.4391,0.4067,0.7991,0.6503,2.6135,1.9547,6.07,5.4252,1.1824,5.1182,0.0311,4.0243,1.7248,0.9224,3.5645,2.9509,2.8519,4.2695,1.5047,2.549,2.1231,2.878,2.7576,4.5367,5.1734,1.6261,3.2101,2.6578,7.0761,1.239,2.3522,2.3675,1.8701,3.4922,0.8049,0.7154,2.8732,3.3682,0.0034,1.1933,0.0439,0.0415,0.6529,1.0416,1.8971,4.5051,4.7948,1.3912,3.1036,1.3253,1.0545,0.0802,0.7884,2.072,1.916,0.65,0.2671]}

Read More\nIt was just over two years ago that The Last of Us was first released, and we were lucky enough for the opportunity to do a roundup of some fantastic games that were being touted by critics and fans alike. Now that it seems to be in a bit of a rut, is The Last of Us Part II the answer to all our prayers? Or are we better off taking our time with another game from this prolific developer, Joel, Ellie and Joel\u2019s friends?\nIt is a tough game to judge, although with this review I will give it an outright A from our community. The Last of Us Part II is just so well rounded we can never say that it fails to live up to the hype. If you like a more dramatic, intense RPG game with a great open world to explore all of the hidden secrets and plot twists of this sequel, then you just might be a fan of The Last of Us II. If however, you just can\u2019t stand to see any story be a pre-determined ending and want to explore a game in its entirety, don\u2019t give it a single second of your time, this game is a no-brainer.\nWe are the survivors. The city is falling. You are the only hope of mankind. And you have just enough time to make it.","token_len":350,"entropy":[5.9246,1.6421,1.526,1.2321,5.582,10.5814,2.8598,0.7927,1.3512,5.8124,0.1177,1.8566,5.5275,0.4199,1.3604,2.0267,0.351,4.4178,3.0725,2.6782,1.2145,3.1062,6.7877,0.0536,0.5167,7.5545,0.6799,5.3105,3.7205,0.2193,1.6901,0.003,3.2563,12.0009,9.7074,7.5487,3.7984,2.641,0.8238,3.2446,6.2643,0.0108,0.1445,7.1211,5.3089,0.6754,0.8214,3.5801,0.8472,1.457,7.3431,0.0023,2.5694,1.1493,0.3942,1.3345,3.9728,0.0309,4.5464,5.0113,1.6871,6.2467,3.4486,4.9464,1.7688,2.6093,4.6269,5.1977,3.4975,0.3111,4.8041,6.5707,4.0155,1.8088,0.5262,3.226,9.5591,4.0402,1.6433,0.8529,15.911,1.3387,4.0906,3.0097,1.7425,2.8484,0.2254,0.3655,6.4251,6.0918,2.4795,0.1215,2.088,3.7496,0.9936,2.0796,1.2189,3.8198,2.0472,4.2873,0.8324,6.9063,2.1346,4.3886,0.2007,3.892,2.1668,9.3859,0.3568,2.8032,6.9817,3.7728,2.2552,2.0511,4.6541,6.9537,2.0709,3.6757,1.4053,2.1606,0.9604,0.3217,3.6423,2.2025,1.9594,5.1988,2.628,0.7041,3.5721,3.3424,3.9206,0.0617,0.1922,4.3422,0.0568,0.3016,6.5644,2.9244,0.0238,0.1042,0.0008,8.1749,1.8731,3.0228,4.2395,0.9279,3.2334,2.5274,4.6352,0.3462,3.8983,2.6645,0.6188,6.0079,0.0448,5.0495,2.3088,1.0717,2.8513,3.1975,2.4949,3.4302,3.5982,5.6657,4.1707,1.9729,8.5528,3.802,11.7303,2.1144,3.7079,13.8795,8.3418,4.0295,5.4565,0.7367,1.4515,3.4475,2.5458,2.0298,4.42,4.6113,1.1185,3.3219,1.3016,5.3537,5.235,4.1384,5.3294,2.1965,2.9559,2.9651,2.3445,3.5933,7.8657,4.5688,6.6847,4.6035,6.5498,1.0035,2.338,1.4514,0.0571,0.0012,1.0399,0.1236,0.8477,4.9184,3.9199,3.6927,6.7058,6.1325,2.0985,5.1384,3.6843,2.6483,0.7808,6.208,0.8512,3.9805,0.004,0.0068,1.3988,1.4512,1.0681,4.2953,0.61,3.0149,3.3716,5.2323,5.9798,2.2681,5.205,5.3634,4.9008,2.5906,1.2029,3.928,6.297,0.1316,3.9571,0.5367,7.1377,3.7979,0.552,7.1839,2.868,1.9868,5.8004,1.2445,2.2456,2.6231,3.7808,0.3357,1.0077,1.5856,6.7433,0.4139,2.4129,3.1225,0.5781,0.1993,1.1309,0.0167,0.0287,0.0007,5.6323,0.1814,3.1379,8.3296,0.7919,0.2518,3.5142,3.1491,13.7485,1.7101,0.0271,3.1259,2.3641,2.7408,3.5402,6.3318,5.0722,5.256,6.9882,3.7935,3.6358,0.09,2.7097,2.9698,3.6553,0.5478,5.5119,2.4683,4.2771,3.2451,2.5466,1.0372,0.847,6.4634,1.5478,0.8471,0.0096,3.7349,1.8675,0.2817,6.446,2.2062,1.7954,1.5949,0.9616,2.5524,3.1921,0.7981,0.7108,3.3658,5.6595,1.3662,0.2686,0.5524,0.9548,3.6889,2.2629,5.5165,6.9404,2.954,2.5995,6.5454,1.9542,4.3244,2.407,4.0658,1.184,1.6917,2.3882,5.0102,2.6221,8.0237,0.4175,3.5741,2.4116,2.4532,4.5813,5.9999,1.7952,0.3025,3.1795,1.3345,2.673]}

In a split decision, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said state lawmakers are limited to drawing legislative maps that are based on a \u201ccount of the electorate\u201d, and not on population alone.\nAt least 13 people have died as a result of the flash flood, that inundated the village of Kamandul at the northern end of the district, officials said. Officials on Monday launched a relief and mitigation effort for the flood-hit residents in the areas of Dhanbari, Barmer, Gali Khasi and Gali Shankar of the district.

But, just as in the first leg of his recent trip, a flurry of criticism followed the pontiff\u2019s suggestion that Myanmar\u2019s military government should provide immediate help to the refugees in order to save them from starvation.\nA former member of Myanmar\u2019s Buddhist military junta, the Catholic president of the national council of Catholics called for a stop to the violence and urged the government to provide humanitarian help to the refugees:\nWhat is surprising is that the government continues to repress its people and it is not providing any protection to the refugees. For a Catholic, this is not a credible position.\nA Myanmar Buddhist priest tells us the government should not only extend humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya but to restore the dignity of their people :\nThe government needs to take immediate measures to end the suffering of Rohingya people. The people of Myanmar should get back to normalcy.\nThe government is still repressing the freedom of expression and the citizens are facing increasing difficulties in their everyday lives, he added\nHowever, a senior official of the government, Pyo Min Thein, described Francis\u2019s comments as \u201cunfortunate and irresponsible.\u201d\nSpeaking at the same press briefing, he said he is very happy the Catholic leader raised the issue of the refugees but noted that the government has already started its emergency project for rehabilitation and support for the people and that the refugees are not part of it.\nThe military government has announced it will stop violence throughout the country from Sept 1st. But the violence, which has left more than 730 people dead and a thousand injured, continues.","token_len":351,"entropy":[8.7383,4.2185,2.2774,2.6161,0.7904,9.3244,3.8643,0.4197,5.7577,0.4635,5.8393,0.8199,9.3105,9.5296,2.7753,5.0787,2.6564,5.5238,6.4289,0.301,1.8446,1.2858,2.9007,0.6548,6.0582,4.3981,6.1991,1.0845,3.3546,1.5962,4.2996,7.192,0.0315,1.37,5.1661,1.0234,1.6422,4.8098,5.9058,0.0009,4.4828,3.717,1.614,3.299,0.0013,14.6911,8.0331,2.2718,6.6431,0.3137,3.5915,9.6243,0.3426,0.0155,3.1814,3.9973,2.6094,4.6891,5.8776,2.3113,0.3402,1.695,1.3142,2.9607,2.8727,0.0546,3.4091,1.8689,0.6788,5.1026,0.8927,0.5249,11.1293,5.2922,3.9314,0.0047,2.8422,5.2798,0.0504,0.0255,3.9745,3.9561,4.4183,0.0111,0.3745,2.3698,8.6334,7.3648,3.0624,1.2249,6.303,3.1267,2.6189,7.3634,4.5924,0.8335,1.8738,7.1955,0.1161,0.8836,3.2026,1.8199,2.1696,1.0262,1.6389,0.1541,2.9362,1.6591,3.7475,0.8935,0.8044,0.7481,5.7183,0.8518,5.5257,1.9885,7.3358,0.647,0.4533,1.431,2.834,4.9237,0.0788,8.2844,0.133,3.6008,2.6026,1.9032,5.1213,1.6619,2.7029,4.9398,1.6887,6.0431,1.2656,1.0899,0.9633,0.7446,5.4673,3.6144,4.2482,2.3332,2.1815,0.6376,2.4769,1.5186,7.4504,3.955,0.6623,2.0063,3.5382,5.6282,2.9726,3.2105,5.2031,4.5913,2.8661,2.3202,2.0461,3.0334,5.3088,7.6212,0.9788,0.7174,0.6561,0.7181,1.7803,1.9468,2.6737,6.8038,1.7159,2.5459,0.371,2.6027,1.5289,8.3192,0.8174,1.8388,1.3236,2.9801,0.1231,3.0247,2.6774,3.3038,0.2806,3.9196,0.6664,3.9869,0.6692,2.8165,1.5529,1.3946,1.9121,4.5689,1.0356,0.2519,2.2038,4.8621,3.5954,0.9439,3.7833,2.2003,1.2775,1.6318,2.2699,3.044,2.7195,4.7859,5.9173,0.0197,1.3676,8.5217,0.1252,3.4194,1.3508,2.0953,7.9327,2.4333,4.5232,5.2918,5.0418,1.3877,1.5249,3.7973,0.1293,2.6244,6.1403,1.6441,5.3046,5.1577,0.0545,3.28,3.6033,1.9826,1.7857,0.4052,2.8444,2.6099,6.6406,7.8718,6.1225,8.4378,2.3236,0.4711,5.369,7.9843,2.4892,0.0845,0.0052,1.5982,0.2261,11.4727,4.1875,3.6261,3.4402,0.042,2.6781,3.83,3.1177,4.888,7.1043,0.7713,5.0728,2.0433,1.466,4.6283,2.839,3.1128,0.6181,1.8778,0.6781,3.9942,3.6804,4.4788,2.9585,3.4522,3.3702,3.0273,5.5844,0.5155,0.477,0.8189,2.0453,3.2971,3.3676,4.6247,0.3583,1.3321,1.7192,2.0863,3.3447,3.3055,4.0354,5.9072,7.3048,3.0642,6.7523,2.3575,6.1026,1.7234,0.6598,2.8744,4.0418,2.0647,1.5239,3.5885,1.5872,1.9408,5.7943,0.0014,3.2378,0.2939,0.4579,1.852,6.2621,2.4446,1.6845,4.6064,2.4169,0.422,4.5622,6.4208,7.5322,0.577,0.1221,5.4033,7.9141,3.5454,3.2558,1.8175,3.2927,2.2436,5.1721,4.283,1.3001,1.1023,3.1976,2.0243,0.0126,4.6242,6.2459,0.4151,0.1013,1.1385,4.4917,3.9795,0.6792,0.3766,2.4968,1.2307]}

Reuters has not edited the statements","text":"The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @ realDonaldTrump and @ POTUS. The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements.\nA senior Trump ally said Mr. Trump was furious about Mr. Schiff's remarks and that he had called the speaker to voice his displeasure. The source said Mr. Schiff's remark had been taken out of context. Mr. Schiff, who is a California Democrat, has overseen the impeachment probe against Mr. Trump since January, when he came face to face with the President for the first time, although Mr. Schiff had previously made public statements indicating he believed he had solid facts to back up his hypothesis. The president has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\"This is a completely mischaracterization of what I said,\" Mr. Schiff told reporters on Monday. \"I do think it\u2019s outrageous to attack the president of the United States on his social media. I know they\u2019ve been attacked on a daily basis and I said the same thing, the speaker, but I said so at the time.\u201d\nMr. Schiff's comments on Monday took place just days after Mr. Trump dismissed the intelligence committee recommendation to convict him and said he would not concede defeat at the Nov. 3 election. The president then tried unsuccessfully to pressure Ukraine to launch a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, his Democratic rivals' son, a move that Mr. Trump said would be a \"great gift to Joe Biden\".\nMr. Trump added that a statement released by Mr. Schiff late on Monday, when the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution calling for the removal of the top Democrat on the committee, was \u201cterrible, terrible.\u201d","token_len":352,"entropy":[7.2906,6.1509,1.6094,5.1922,2.2298,1.4007,10.3533,2.5742,3.002,0.3661,6.5793,0.6589,0.0604,0.0377,2.7618,0.7475,0.0352,2.1855,6.8098,12.1442,0.0422,1.2892,0.3752,4.9875,0.011,1.2774,2.9391,6.5302,0.1177,1.0814,2.6325,0.4469,0.6392,6.9055,2.4984,1.1834,8.2564,1.397,3.7111,1.3805,0.8364,13.2561,4.2917,2.6099,4.637,1.658,5.6714,0.2074,0.4022,2.2737,5.2607,2.6643,2.6081,0.0009,5.9236,0.0911,2.5048,1.3481,1.9477,1.1723,2.1632,3.726,1.4534,4.7506,1.9074,5.0638,0.3975,1.3544,0.3594,2.7356,2.6684,0.7848,1.1092,0.0005,1.5789,2.2452,4.4795,3.0662,1.0538,2.9673,0.4252,0.0477,0.002,1.3007,3.2463,0.0007,0.8312,2.0595,1.0673,1.5169,1.6454,4.6779,0.6565,0.3889,1.9612,7.4249,1.1718,5.7624,5.2085,2.3716,1.4515,0.0003,0.0899,2.7995,3.0501,1.9302,0.7328,0.8124,5.4344,7.294,0.9383,0.0014,0.0021,1.7092,4.0348,2.6656,2.552,0.2379,0.0044,3.5092,5.922,3.3234,0.0005,1.3259,2.9154,2.6075,4.6115,3.4189,0.982,5.2166,0.9417,3.3313,2.9926,1.0489,7.0284,4.6198,0.9811,0.281,0.3031,0.5146,9.1317,0.5938,2.6988,5.2757,1.985,2.7039,1.4922,1.601,1.1718,1.2461,0.6136,3.7886,2.9708,0.6984,1.3982,5.1354,6.1244,0.4241,0.5317,0.2794,1.3875,2.6792,0.7299,1.5962,0.8808,0.0004,1.1765,1.7952,1.1655,1.6726,1.9097,0.4695,0.4745,0.9445,4.5761,3.0029,1.7362,16.819,7.1767,1.9145,5.0825,2.6619,5.7281,1.7576,2.0461,1.901,0.0672,0.0124,0.0014,2.6567,2.776,6.2345,0.0241,2.3,1.0969,4.5848,5.2367,6.8932,0.4095,2.4242,1.26,5.0561,0.982,2.3097,1.7528,0.0062,2.6608,0.885,5.3938,3.6213,0.9345,0.2039,3.1982,4.3342,9.4474,2.3602,2.6656,1.0999,2.6118,5.4426,4.2777,0.8235,2.4181,1.2773,6.0967,9.1272,3.2031,1.5938,0.0006,0.4948,2.0248,0.9553,3.3259,1.1969,5.6466,2.1466,2.863,1.8876,0.3836,1.4187,0.0006,0.1082,5.9372,1.7999,4.7592,3.2645,4.4212,1.8124,7.1356,2.6823,3.4904,4.2785,1.0779,1.2628,1.581,7.6715,3.1203,4.5556,0.2001,4.2171,0.0004,6.2751,1.3872,0.5205,2.2972,2.6966,4.6309,5.5963,5.6196,0.0632,4.8618,10.0702,1.3258,6.6034,0.7621,4.8861,0.2266,0.6166,17.0033,5.3812,0.368,3.6197,1.9835,6.5763,4.752,5.5909,2.3597,4.5698,7.0385,0.4673,2.2368,0.0003,0.3393,1.9503,1.7111,1.871,1.8927,1.1671,3.539,5.8187,1.2637,8.8085,1.042,4.8248,0.6565,1.6387,0.0008,0.4161,6.0924,1.0392,5.0038,5.3908,5.3099,0.6882,1.3944,0.0012,1.6223,6.7376,1.3977,0.2281,3.6608,3.4197,1.8769,2.6614,3.9493,0.0228,4.1134,1.405,2.7437,1.7431,0.6778,1.6333,3.8588,0.017,2.1947,5.0965,0.5115,0.6432,0.1137,1.3622,0.2467,1.7566,14.8974,4.6313,6.3359,1.5259,2.8721,4.8691,1.5956,4.1163,2.0731]}

Negotiations on renegotiations are also expected to begin in October 2020.\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that on July 1, 2019, President Donald Trump ordered representatives from the U.S. Trade Representative office of Mexico and Canada to inform Washington on the status of negotiations. Although this was supposed to be the first step to conclude the negotiations, the process was not taken up.","token_len":352,"entropy":[9.037,2.6914,4.2619,5.871,1.0159,2.669,0.8437,1.4302,0.5092,0.349,3.2609,7.4001,0.2322,3.5589,4.8476,6.2277,1.8681,0.4227,3.3132,0.477,2.2451,2.1629,4.4786,1.7117,4.5851,3.265,0.0175,8.0455,0.2769,0.0193,1.5576,1.1039,1.2106,6.9366,0.051,1.1449,2.2606,0.1586,0.0669,0.0004,0.0157,0.9938,0.0061,0.0,0.0,0.4954,0.2006,15.5227,1.2796,1.8189,0.8532,1.0788,2.7657,3.6749,0.2884,5.9049,4.8236,4.0139,0.4989,0.7393,3.5874,2.4016,1.4773,1.5593,0.1795,1.649,6.3014,3.929,1.3383,7.1765,0.0086,0.6436,4.0588,0.0129,0.0401,1.1207,0.0025,0.0011,0.8683,0.5197,2.5891,3.0098,2.2828,4.9836,6.0215,3.606,2.1771,0.0173,0.1672,0.1061,0.5899,0.6603,4.2471,2.745,0.2194,3.7172,3.6052,0.4635,0.7005,3.5823,0.0639,7.1388,0.5543,5.904,4.9952,3.6828,3.0263,0.481,4.3474,2.4222,3.3954,4.7138,0.1195,3.5754,4.4294,5.7492,16.882,7.9044,4.0732,0.0062,1.1708,0.5734,4.4699,3.8645,3.4973,1.2201,5.223,8.254,1.8844,8.5525,6.2952,5.0144,6.4889,0.1812,1.329,5.5517,6.0222,1.1253,3.2438,7.1409,1.4249,3.4104,4.7843,1.8417,3.0018,2.6931,4.4871,0.4086,1.6186,3.8141,0.05,1.9238,1.9946,1.2498,2.537,0.1918,1.4591,5.7154,4.5176,2.093,0.0531,3.2215,2.1337,1.6998,6.759,3.2829,0.5133,4.3529,0.0032,6.7369,2.8753,1.9181,4.5457,5.513,5.4962,0.8769,1.9586,7.365,0.1458,6.1974,6.6272,0.2128,0.9874,7.1836,0.5777,4.5104,6.3809,0.0633,0.0136,3.8604,3.9281,0.3053,0.1463,4.8456,2.2076,0.4622,5.3181,0.0506,0.0705,8.1424,2.8377,2.3715,1.3908,1.329,0.0845,0.3569,1.3063,5.0262,2.6532,1.7122,5.3383,0.0399,4.4715,1.0203,3.7349,0.0076,0.0497,0.0007,0.0334,6.5812,0.4417,0.408,0.0023,2.0798,0.4845,0.5117,1.7198,0.1798,3.2968,2.8375,4.619,0.6188,2.8425,0.0686,1.647,2.2074,0.0803,0.1262,2.8728,0.2519,0.9007,1.4123,3.5071,0.0031,0.0047,0.1634,4.5769,4.8153,0.612,4.4607,0.693,3.4006,0.3311,0.4127,0.8953,1.6089,4.5095,4.4789,5.8422,0.0441,8.0199,0.0278,3.3944,3.8843,4.2271,2.6845,3.145,1.0709,1.3601,0.9078,0.1602,0.0008,4.1981,1.2196,2.9076,0.0046,1.4282,1.8853,7.3023,2.7728,2.5528,3.8671,0.9193,0.053,1.2463,0.8264,3.3723,4.7951,0.4371,0.3945,4.1539,0.0125,3.1392,0.6098,5.0336,3.1351,0.0733,5.3283,3.2883,1.5683,0.1709,5.0742,0.1372,2.4561,0.874,0.118,5.0685,10.2677,1.2872,1.4199,2.1698,0.0011,0.0268,0.5583,2.7051,0.023,7.8337,3.8057,4.7468,1.5693,0.249,0.1968,6.5536,5.5752,3.3046,0.8364,2.3612,0.0228,2.2414,1.2135,5.6154,3.0324,2.1766,5.0078,0.0018,0.7685,1.6537,1.1898,2.8023,2.5894,5.7604,0.9407,1.7573,0.2559,1.5272,4.837,1.8381,3.3232,6.1044,2.6336,2.3284]}

During a Thursday afternoon meeting between Trump and Xi-an Xi, the Trump administration is to announce measures to try to cut access to opioid drugs, which have been blamed for the deaths of more than 44,000 people in the U.S. last year. The president said in a speech that \u201c we are committed to making sure Americans have access to treatment for pain. \u201d He also promised to put pressure on China to make better medicines for diabetes drugs that are \u201c not as good, \u201d and promised to do more to promote \u201c Chinese medicines \u201d in the country. \u201c China has a tremendous problem with opioids, not as much as the United States, \u201d said the president. Trump has repeatedly called for drugs to be decriminalized, allowing people to get painkillers for nonmedical reasons. \u201cI think there should be decriminalization, \u201d he told CNN last week, adding that he was looking to the European Union for a model. In addition to the U.S. opioid crisis, Trump asked Xi-an Xi to help deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Xi reportedly agreed to help the World Health Organization with COVID-19 and said China was \u201c ready \u201d to offer supplies to the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies office, CNN reported. In December, Trump announced that the U.S. has struck a deal with China to provide masks for countries and states in need and has been ordered to buy millions of additional face masks for the U.S. military.","token_len":352,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,1.8006,2.3177,0.5298,1.2234,4.0053,3.739,0.0837,0.0026,0.0066,2.9322,2.6669,8.0072,16.5366,8.8691,8.2547,4.6135,2.4628,5.4131,0.1438,2.435,3.0512,0.0006,0.0076,17.0169,0.5116,1.821,1.92,2.3326,4.0119,6.046,0.6393,3.646,0.0215,0.1061,0.5802,6.9769,0.952,7.1815,3.4772,2.136,4.9855,1.418,0.1213,1.0351,8.548,6.1968,6.4704,0.5755,1.7443,5.0225,0.2462,3.8371,5.6015,2.8722,4.9532,0.414,5.5557,0.1637,4.7074,7.0398,0.0399,2.3684,1.9609,1.7531,2.5789,1.8752,1.5317,3.3877,0.218,2.3449,1.403,0.1048,1.0209,0.0065,7.6567,0.0505,0.0057,0.3525,0.6063,0.3285,0.5668,0.0003,0.0007,0.1771,4.2417,0.0259,0.2242,2.5938,3.0686,2.2457,3.9212,0.9452,2.5455,1.506,7.978,0.6182,3.3514,1.967,3.3587,0.1104,3.1879,0.9927,5.327,1.1934,0.2138,0.0343,5.0517,2.2448,2.0385,3.1975,2.2705,4.5212,3.2949,1.2394,4.0917,0.6102,4.1467,3.2289,0.0117,2.626,0.4068,3.7095,3.1933,5.1416,1.5699,10.8449,7.0746,3.401,1.2918,11.9208,0.3902,3.3879,3.6598,3.7763,3.1687,6.8162,1.4839,1.0028,7.6448,0.4743,4.6398,1.1057,0.0952,5.0947,11.0691,0.2206,6.4255,4.6564,4.5841,1.025,2.6025,1.0598,4.2639,0.4225,4.6327,3.2575,4.5271,1.5378,2.6475,5.0145,3.5401,0.7877,2.1263,1.3771,4.6168,5.9748,0.9805,0.3349,2.1097,1.6464,0.0018,1.4889,5.9974,0.3737,3.8989,1.6759,0.561,0.7533,3.7549,2.5575,3.0884,2.4239,0.6766,7.5632,0.5786,0.0734,6.1719,0.0039,1.0032,7.4193,2.8509,0.3778,2.3304,3.6837,1.533,2.865,5.3435,1.2519,0.7405,0.7228,4.335,2.0218,9.7957,1.7255,2.8262,3.2325,0.0286,6.3437,0.0208,1.7853,4.2526,0.2604,2.1393,3.2906,4.4205,4.476,0.6007,1.7184,3.082,0.3943,1.3033,2.6694,4.1385,2.4783,3.4533,5.744,0.0414,1.1884,1.7475,4.5597,1.2292,3.7255,3.1013,1.0323,1.5479,1.9434,0.0003,0.007,1.544,1.4175,0.152,0.0779,1.7681,6.5919,0.9115,1.5788,0.0615,0.5165,0.5963,3.4355,5.2851,0.0155,1.0421,10.6124,1.2102,0.1878,4.1129,0.0246,2.4087,3.1645,7.2426,4.0385,0.8825,1.8308,2.805,4.6278,0.0352,0.0091,2.6875,9.8173,10.5674,4.2451,6.3018,2.9228,4.4778,5.4881,2.3083,8.254,0.4199,3.2826,2.3188,0.4257,0.3938,5.3397,7.3118,0.8874,1.3967,3.4357,0.0821,0.025,5.3299,6.2633,6.3133,8.97,6.4433,2.3183,4.3101,0.2285,0.2021,3.5806,4.1674,0.2457,1.5722,3.3265,0.9051,1.9409,0.8291,0.0005,0.0119,0.0246,4.9212,6.5786,0.3354,0.6522,0.3803,1.6833,0.3882,3.0039,10.4695,1.5968,7.8317,5.0454,4.3921,3.1559,2.3837,5.032,4.8785,3.5885,6.5081,0.3909,5.3729,5.6396,0.2288,4.7434,6.0967,0.0624,2.5177,1.4809,1.7763,0.0005,0.0021,0.0873,1.6127,0.458]}

The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after they wrote an expos\u00e9 about human rights abuses committed by the military and police against Rohingya Muslims in the northern state of Rakhine.\nNed Price, a research scientist at Human Rights Watch who was a witness of one trial, was quoted as saying that a report by prosecutors in the case would only provide an assessment that the journalists\u2019 statements were true and \u201cit has no legal standing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a formality required by the courts. But this is part of a very important ongoing criminal investigation and it goes to the broader criminal investigation.\u201d\nReuters said the two were being tried in connection with articles published in January on alleged abuses by the army. In the articles it accused the military of killing at least 18 civilians, torturing hundreds more and arresting scores. The report came in the wake of a United Nations Security Council vote that condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims.\nWa Lone, 30, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 31, were sentenced to over seven years of imprisonment on Tuesday for their roles in the reports.

There were no significant differences in the top-performing motherboards for either AMD or Intel processors, but our tests showed that the best motherboards were the Asus Z97-A Pro and Gigabyte B85A-G Pro, with the Intel i7 9700K being their top performer.","token_len":353,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,7.2739,4.122,5.9593,0.0051,3.4391,2.2846,1.9614,0.499,1.4936,2.9571,7.5428,0.0896,3.1458,1.465,0.0885,1.1302,3.7276,0.6366,1.6358,4.9483,4.4472,0.0685,6.0516,4.6155,6.5197,0.3156,0.6165,5.6358,1.0589,1.5503,0.3861,1.1392,0.4599,1.1889,1.2961,4.7102,4.8419,0.3486,0.1503,0.2221,1.1657,0.0509,3.709,1.467,1.6784,2.2525,1.4142,6.8217,2.7948,0.9066,0.6695,2.122,0.4116,0.1356,14.9512,7.53,6.6278,3.9544,0.5741,0.7158,7.2483,5.2497,8.1765,3.4311,0.922,0.7682,4.4645,3.64,8.9799,2.3971,2.3057,2.6015,4.169,1.1742,2.3899,1.9156,0.8736,0.6657,4.561,3.4243,3.6925,0.0812,5.3209,0.8293,4.1548,1.0243,0.8894,5.4014,4.2384,0.4036,0.0034,0.2795,3.9667,0.5929,0.353,1.6507,5.3071,0.5646,1.3148,8.707,2.1449,0.0152,3.8946,1.6799,4.293,3.134,2.9719,1.3066,2.8708,5.9594,8.0064,7.088,0.2685,0.2317,2.5857,3.5257,2.1682,1.9028,4.5074,2.158,0.6586,5.8385,0.8758,0.4958,1.1361,0.4154,1.1764,2.4263,4.1334,1.221,4.4181,3.6325,0.4002,3.4562,1.9403,3.3272,3.7484,0.0161,1.4358,5.3786,1.0373,4.2749,0.4334,2.2762,5.6689,7.5027,7.0355,0.8895,4.4523,1.2113,2.6436,0.6005,1.0146,0.6776,1.5326,1.9266,9.4199,3.0828,3.9834,2.0519,1.0342,0.2025,0.3234,3.411,0.1719,1.9153,9.1184,7.6621,5.4879,1.7344,2.4989,2.6803,1.6349,3.5105,1.4372,2.735,3.1402,1.4001,1.0701,5.4522,1.3012,7.9048,5.49,1.9575,3.8327,4.7918,2.0661,2.9579,3.1078,0.967,7.6965,0.8383,3.9476,2.7015,3.8498,0.4861,3.1519,2.9856,7.3773,5.1732,1.9382,1.0891,4.477,2.108,0.601,0.0308,0.3698,1.5384,2.5215,3.1291,1.8565,11.9591,1.3154,2.6023,0.011,4.7152,0.0965,5.7943,5.6484,2.2409,5.517,3.3401,0.0273,1.3289,4.4364,1.1176,1.0679,6.4325,4.997,1.3508,6.5,1.1013,6.3387,2.7968,6.0342,9.1857,10.3548,7.6062,1.9608,3.2159,7.2656,0.6981,1.5494,4.0817,0.734,1.926,3.494,9.281,3.711,2.017,6.0283,0.5722,1.7403,4.2122,0.2637,0.9375,2.2656,10.4298,4.3534,4.8545,6.1334,2.3239,1.9367,1.3853,4.1964,6.3965,1.561,3.8616,6.5033,3.0355,5.7577,6.904,2.8994,11.8319,8.7087,2.7042,0.4448,1.798,0.1557,5.7829,0.0004,7.1534,6.2961,1.2566,1.2743,6.0033,6.5598,1.8355,2.1846,0.5161,4.4749,2.0142,3.1812,4.5206,2.5948,1.0143,1.6975,5.9878,1.9601,4.8479,5.3123,0.0128,3.5667,3.4073,5.6897,0.6049,0.3203,4.5361,1.3059,1.3863,5.7332,5.7909,1.3517,0.468,1.3611,3.9207,3.3801,0.0226,1.9739,2.2632,6.5183,3.6699,2.018,2.6215,3.6801,5.9056,1.5683,4.4309,0.0072,4.5748,6.348,4.6807,1.0388,3.136,3.7818,1.595,2.2763,1.4385,3.8797,3.6618,0.6895,5.5669,3.7023,0.5322,3.2677,6.1491,2.7274,2.0513,0.3843]}
{"prompt":"Inside the newly renovated Church of Saint George in the Northern Iraqi town of Teleskof , Hayat Chamoun Daoud led children dressed as Santa Claus singing Jingle Bells in Aramaic . Like every other resident","text":"Inside the newly renovated Church of Saint George in the Northern Iraqi town of Teleskof, Hayat Chamoun Daoud led children dressed as Santa Claus singing Jingle Bells in Aramaic. Like every other resident of Teleskof, the 20-year-old was expecting a safe life to return even after the U.S. military departed. Instead, he had only fled persecution. The church was closed for repairs; Daoud was not allowed to see a local imam over fears of sectarian violence.\nIt took months to repair the church destroyed last year. In a desperate effort to show his love and faith in Jesus Christ, Daoud decided he would make a house for the children of the town. The first building had been started; a room for their homework; a library, a kitchen \u2013 a whole schoolhouse that would be open to all children no matter their gender, religion or ethnicity.\n\u201cWe want the children to come to a school where they can have fun without any pressure,\u201d said Daoud of the project.\n\u201cThe first years, everything was done with volunteers. We collected money and were able to purchase a lot of building materials,\" Daoud said. \"For the last six months, all this money has gone to paying the workers; we would have lost our minds without them. The renovation has been a success because of the wonderful people we have met here.\"\nThe volunteers were mostly young, and most of them were just young adults. In fact, there were no older volunteers. Daoud had expected to find a local imam and have the project blessed by someone from the community.

The Democratic-led Senate and several Republican-led ones approved a funding measure in July, and the House was unable to approve the measure, which was meant to stop spending cuts that could come along with an extended government operating budget.\nDemocrats on Tuesday said they hope the stopgap funding measure they want to put up could be approved by a simple procedural vote on the House floor without having to seek a conference bill.","token_len":353,"entropy":[10.3929,0.2247,0.0365,1.052,1.6889,4.163,0.0022,0.4664,2.697,0.9376,0.1755,3.6606,0.0006,0.0021,0.0282,0.1596,0.4359,0.0095,0.3058,1.4204,3.1952,2.3936,0.4938,4.5294,3.3604,0.8552,2.0623,5.4862,3.0289,5.9158,0.1079,0.0001,0.0004,0.0004,0.768,0.2336,2.8263,1.1755,1.9405,8.0619,0.058,5.0261,1.5894,0.4887,1.1746,7.4817,0.729,4.9517,0.0009,0.0065,0.0509,2.1694,15.3361,7.2852,3.7063,4.2461,0.2341,2.6897,2.5606,0.0049,3.3826,0.5147,0.5621,15.7881,5.0339,8.2547,8.2125,5.4844,3.2001,3.0228,4.7556,0.4754,4.2658,2.7688,1.7273,3.0552,0.0059,2.0987,2.1172,2.9458,1.539,0.4158,0.5842,0.5338,0.6501,0.0761,1.6248,0.5085,0.2496,7.7084,0.1991,0.0097,4.3266,0.9761,1.3814,0.4779,7.2441,1.0626,0.2231,0.3681,0.0237,5.146,0.2879,3.8989,5.2432,2.0768,2.6847,6.7601,5.5832,0.6544,1.0244,0.3029,2.7003,3.6102,9.3561,4.2603,1.9288,2.7664,5.1056,1.6722,2.4502,5.9607,0.9117,6.7061,7.4566,1.5945,4.7669,3.2416,0.7526,0.0771,0.5659,0.4872,9.1821,0.0027,2.3868,0.8941,1.6045,4.0518,0.0191,0.0389,0.3741,3.6349,0.0162,1.9648,0.2653,0.7569,1.4388,4.0441,1.5024,3.1212,1.5573,5.9752,1.4687,6.7301,1.5236,7.2355,3.2533,4.094,3.4591,0.0008,4.8052,5.0778,2.9303,3.8099,12.1159,3.6754,0.8028,1.6979,6.5911,5.2869,2.8799,4.3022,5.2934,5.5474,0.7787,0.3501,4.7617,5.6079,3.7833,2.7492,3.9685,2.5909,5.017,3.5888,0.3699,1.1281,0.4744,3.0604,1.4595,4.8464,1.4529,5.2427,2.1964,1.7924,2.3282,5.6149,4.8137,2.6732,4.2587,0.3806,0.7095,5.2494,1.0054,1.6849,5.6413,2.206,3.8549,5.9711,1.7169,1.5731,0.8703,3.934,0.0005,1.0271,1.2271,4.1107,0.3841,4.8299,2.2822,0.0739,1.7327,2.9795,0.6723,1.0768,0.0432,0.4566,3.6589,2.4814,4.3535,0.7207,2.3082,1.0046,1.3816,0.6671,0.3453,5.7622,1.3637,5.4068,2.6479,4.3928,7.4618,5.1142,0.1015,4.9617,1.1752,3.3312,5.191,6.7948,0.5716,4.4156,0.6451,5.8104,1.1509,4.2534,0.3815,3.3713,0.3845,6.4666,2.5622,0.4115,4.1288,4.0673,8.4322,7.1515,3.3973,1.3392,1.2046,4.1651,1.0233,2.5071,4.9071,2.9758,0.6815,2.8688,4.3132,6.7302,2.0637,0.4929,0.587,8.4152,6.161,2.1567,4.653,2.0824,1.7073,2.4951,1.4054,2.0401,1.4259,1.3225,4.0104,3.9271,0.0084,3.2893,1.0284,1.4311,2.6463,1.3821,1.8079,5.3999,0.0499,3.9599,4.6569,2.6884,2.994,3.9415,4.1338,5.5108,0.2272,3.6342,2.8126,1.3568,9.8653,0.9039,0.4342,0.3943,5.3374,3.7804,1.6359,1.998,0.7429,3.9502,1.6235,3.5598,0.0001,2.132,2.0744,6.0733,3.4304,1.038,2.7665,2.8388,3.5728,0.9881,2.8444,1.0323,2.7231,2.5212,6.7178,0.1498,3.1609,2.1504,0.4165,0.0357,5.8467,3.9194,0.1637,6.6286,1.1874,5.9424,5.4438,0.8848]}

I'm still a bit sad to say goodbye to my adorable 'Goosey Bumps!'","token_len":354,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,6.6838,5.7414,8.4121,3.7406,1.3246,0.5035,0.0382,0.361,2.4811,0.6865,3.3512,6.9704,0.3564,0.1509,0.7525,0.4155,0.923,3.22,1.7489,5.0208,0.0028,1.3937,0.0052,0.7502,2.03,0.3751,1.7902,2.049,0.1296,7.2306,4.6725,6.6185,1.3258,3.7089,13.639,1.5327,15.1056,3.603,1.1799,1.5481,0.0085,0.1708,5.2675,0.5868,1.853,18.7328,9.662,0.5346,1.1158,1.5639,3.3367,0.5418,4.0668,5.2495,1.6894,1.309,0.2528,5.17,1.6317,3.4994,0.0165,0.5862,2.5988,0.035,0.6103,2.6453,6.7029,1.5746,4.748,2.8568,4.9372,0.0455,1.372,4.7028,1.1811,3.5534,0.1406,0.5806,2.6746,2.1161,2.649,5.2457,2.7072,0.4109,7.3235,13.8532,0.14,6.6076,0.2366,12.1268,0.1296,0.0674,0.054,0.0048,0.1651,2.9019,0.0579,11.4084,0.0386,0.0105,3.9631,0.0382,0.0017,7.9871,9.7507,2.0592,2.2445,3.2119,0.6779,2.7532,3.8393,1.8631,3.983,1.8259,1.3942,0.029,2.9651,3.4744,7.7974,1.98,7.0575,4.5452,0.8745,6.3667,9.5978,1.4138,8.4682,0.0036,0.0035,7.5302,0.0764,2.2038,5.7445,2.1399,6.4163,1.1059,0.1667,0.007,5.799,3.2586,0.2011,1.291,4.6298,5.3476,0.1541,7.145,9.607,1.3049,4.0012,4.9287,0.9881,2.5422,6.8806,2.4009,1.0321,4.2135,1.1084,0.0171,0.3534,3.065,0.6264,1.7773,0.1554,1.7241,2.1783,0.5876,3.8012,0.4972,2.2178,9.4873,1.2183,2.1016,3.6639,3.7373,3.3261,0.1456,0.1049,0.0327,0.6624,0.1555,7.6423,8.6828,2.8754,4.153,8.9233,0.3943,5.6387,4.4478,2.7355,1.1845,10.1861,0.1967,2.4924,3.3875,2.0545,1.6122,0.3141,0.7148,0.8788,7.3804,5.1907,0.6355,1.117,2.7955,0.4232,1.381,2.1716,3.5361,1.8853,8.3811,0.2321,8.7145,5.3888,1.6297,1.4639,0.7541,5.509,4.1743,4.638,5.7953,2.0256,4.5792,0.1945,0.5934,9.8668,0.0084,1.7161,4.7943,0.0035,5.4585,0.3526,0.8087,0.0873,1.3972,3.7993,2.0576,2.2475,5.3027,0.7249,3.332,2.9064,4.718,0.9474,2.797,4.46,0.0087,4.2603,0.7115,5.1418,1.958,1.3884,2.5331,1.835,3.5335,0.138,6.2806,0.3075,3.5063,4.1726,1.2057,0.1633,1.2393,4.1824,2.2855,4.337,6.678,1.0496,1.3679,9.207,0.0856,0.0182,6.3116,4.4626,0.424,0.6098,0.078,3.7251,0.7696,0.9188,1.2272,3.6696,1.7726,1.8686,1.0482,2.9425,0.2634,2.786,4.7597,0.2564,3.4766,3.9311,3.1026,8.0542,2.6784,1.47,0.5039,1.6078,5.7362,0.178,1.6043,3.831,0.9102,2.9503,4.2422,1.4187,5.9404,7.4075,0.7633,3.9117,0.4736,1.3856,2.1691,4.9668,5.7358,1.8408,2.037,3.9023,3.0805,5.5882,2.1804,1.1977,1.533,4.3145,2.9917,0.5453,1.1313,0.0685,0.9148,1.7519,2.6722,3.9986,2.2489,2.265,4.5097,2.2326,2.3,7.0636,0.4383,1.6178,6.1972,5.8141,6.3808,2.9494,3.3044,5.0521,8.3258,5.0979]}

Asked what he made of Tillerson \u2019 s reported pending resignation on Thursday, Mattis replied: \u201cAt this time, I think it \u2019 s over.\u201d According to a CNN report, the top Pentagon official told reporters that Trump has been discussing the ouster of his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely, but you never know in this type of situation,\u201d the general said. In the CNN program, \u201cState of the Union,\u201d it was revealed that Haley discussed withdrawing the United States from the Iranian nuclear deal. Trump said during the interview that he was \u201cwilling\u201d to meet with Iran\u2019s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \u201d No one, including Secretary Tillerson, would say what the possible reaction would be, if they were asked about it. \u201cWhen he says nothing, he may not know what he\u2019s saying and people will interpret it in a way that is not in the best interest of our country,\u201d said CNN correspondent Daniel Daley. \u201cAnd we have that knowledge because we know that there have been similar incidents in the past.\u201d However, Trump refused to comment on whether the planned meeting between the two countries took place. One of the main problems in the US-Iran relationship are the alleged assassination plots for Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman and the possible bombing of US interests in Saudi Arabia.

Abbas called for the withdrawal by the United States as agreed by the Oslo Accords.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi confirmed to Channel 13 that he had spoken with Abbas.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. said it would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem starting May 24. Some countries were already moving their embassies, as Palestinians see Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\nEgypt, an ally of the Palestinians, is considering opening a diplomatic mission to Israel in the city of its historical rival Cairo.\nEgypt was planning to reopen its embassy in Israel's previous capital, Jerusalem, but Washington cut the funding for the project due to the move by Israel to relocate its embassy to the east side of the city. The relocation sparked a year of diplomatic wrangling over Jerusalem.\nAbbas, the Palestinian president, had demanded that the U.S. remove its embassy from Jerusalem. The president of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, said that the move was not in the interest of making peace with the Palestinians and that the goal is to make peace with all the neighbors to Israel.\nHezbollah senior commander Abdel Rahman al-Assadi on Thursday told Hezbollah Radio that his group was preparing to carry out a number of operations against Israeli targets in Lebanon. The group, he said, wanted to target high-ranking Israeli figures as well as economic targets.\nAsked to comment on the reports, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the organization did not represent a factor in normalizing relations with the Palestinians.","token_len":354,"entropy":[8.2173,9.5588,4.7194,0.7305,0.0021,0.0002,0.3434,0.039,0.0044,0.0416,7.002,1.2033,4.1004,0.0197,0.3734,5.8745,1.0343,0.0578,0.0058,3.5505,2.435,1.1033,9.6414,0.1425,0.9992,4.1117,0.0034,0.3474,0.4034,1.5478,0.6396,4.2441,2.3193,0.3831,1.1505,0.5051,1.8296,3.0753,3.7202,1.5653,1.132,3.5988,5.1249,0.416,0.4129,3.3098,2.4175,2.0322,1.4423,4.1416,6.7921,1.186,1.5083,0.0233,4.582,9.0124,1.7345,1.3576,9.3709,0.3994,0.0002,1.0093,0.6484,23.7339,2.8369,0.1437,12.6404,0.3494,3.1007,0.322,0.0104,5.1257,2.4135,4.3124,6.7399,0.5112,3.5784,1.5476,1.4801,0.5958,1.0392,1.9698,0.8607,13.7549,0.1313,2.1149,2.5268,0.0006,0.1425,0.0534,5.0955,1.2948,1.5656,4.68,0.7639,0.1954,1.5213,3.1708,0.7979,0.3493,4.9657,4.4221,3.8982,0.724,7.2252,5.7924,4.6602,3.1463,1.3831,0.8777,0.5888,2.9294,3.6103,4.6388,6.3099,3.4375,0.0944,1.8496,0.813,0.1695,0.86,1.0527,0.5988,0.3386,0.4378,4.7801,2.7105,4.885,1.8353,0.0708,1.0283,1.3992,0.3206,2.3629,3.9471,5.041,1.8122,2.442,1.4398,1.305,3.0659,2.2686,0.8073,3.4001,2.9455,6.3751,4.3995,7.8507,5.1863,0.7016,0.7841,3.0304,4.2699,5.6436,0.2856,5.5482,0.7403,0.2691,0.5943,2.5537,3.6959,7.77,1.8217,0.4455,3.0982,0.2959,2.7058,5.8925,6.2772,2.3901,3.3584,1.6104,0.8963,1.8213,3.7612,0.0051,1.9668,5.4803,3.7047,1.8858,3.3709,5.0802,0.8131,0.2608,1.8612,1.4163,5.2964,2.8023,0.226,0.2271,0.4502,0.3031,2.861,6.2344,5.0765,1.5793,6.987,1.6914,3.3799,2.2782,0.0059,2.5542,1.946,1.0884,0.4203,4.7583,0.0046,2.6444,2.8267,1.7294,1.0998,0.1932,3.2774,4.5834,1.2009,1.1244,1.086,0.0004,0.0083,0.018,3.7548,1.456,0.2502,1.2433,1.0336,1.4475,2.2406,5.2338,3.1124,2.7939,0.8239,3.5204,0.0041,0.0001,0.0001,0.0002,0.0548,1.7921,2.7319,1.6253,1.5046,0.9394,2.7445,2.821,1.0677,1.1384,0.0024,6.762,1.6532,1.1436,0.884,0.1195,1.9914,1.3753,1.4985,5.6923,4.1485,0.6064,3.7894,0.7828,0.6146,5.024,2.2149,4.2282,4.4218,3.2159,0.5448,0.411,4.6769,7.0274,7.8693,2.9902,5.6894,3.8451,1.6748,0.0835,4.8445,1.9421,5.0385,2.3647,3.1193,3.8043,3.8402,0.4215,3.3521,0.6981,1.7276,3.532,0.4429,5.0099,0.0114,0.9453,5.1714,0.0011,3.2867,1.8687,2.764,1.7381,0.8109,1.7589,1.0332,2.9736,0.9236,3.0608,3.0093,0.2455,0.0111,4.2406,0.2785,3.748,7.758,0.3441,1.5233,1.7696,4.7984,3.8592,0.238,0.0825,8.2445,2.5499,1.0452,0.2944,6.764,4.0368,1.0773,0.167,0.4921,5.2152,1.1859,4.1121,2.8443,0.1039,1.3705,0.0093,0.0,0.2833,0.5134,1.8168,1.2491,6.7889,3.4483,0.022,6.0163,2.747,8.0773,0.346,9.9702,1.323,0.4017,0.5341,0.7178,0.7158,0.3431]}

The disclosure by U.S. Secretary of State","text":"The United States said on Saturday it was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programs but Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. The disclosure by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the eve of a crucial meeting of the 15-nation council that tracks sanctions on Pyongyang is the latest indication of a deteriorating bilateral relationship between the US and North Korea.\nAfter a standoff with the Trump administration\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from the landmark 2015 nuclear accord, North Korea said it was ready to abandon all missiles over Japan.\nNorth Korea has since conducted what U.S. officials have described as a series of ballistic missile launches as a possible retaliation against that deal and also against U.S. President Donald Trump, which they have said was aimed at undermining his presidential chances.\nPompeo declined to provide specifics on the specific contact between Washington and Pyongyang, saying it was a high-level exercise. He also gave no indication of whether a direct dialogue could be initiated but said there were no restrictions under the accord, which was signed between Washington and the North Korean government on Friday.\nProliferation expert and author Tony Schwartz tells Sky News that the Trump administration might get away with using the Trump summit to negotiate Pyongyang's removal from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nTrump says he will put the U.S. back into the 2015 multilateral nuclear accord, though he faces strong opposition from conservatives, and North Korea says he should first stop his own nuclear and missile programs.\nThe Trump administration, which is seeking to use the Asia-Pacific tour as a way to improve relations with Asian nations, has had a rocky relationship with Japan and China, both of whom are targets of North Korea's missile and nuclear threats.","token_len":355,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,6.9187,2.142,2.6592,0.8022,1.4537,8.7442,7.461,0.1849,3.5003,0.0902,3.0514,1.926,1.9178,1.76,0.2531,0.96,4.0898,5.6987,3.4142,6.3213,0.5896,3.0089,0.0921,4.8902,0.9066,3.7941,10.0246,3.2691,2.7038,0.0008,0.1492,0.0166,2.3718,0.0015,0.0242,9.4502,0.1805,0.0005,3.0794,3.1422,5.6588,0.0013,1.3368,5.0172,1.1637,0.9105,0.8117,6.9493,0.0561,0.3431,6.2062,3.8736,8.412,5.6344,2.01,1.4575,3.3952,1.9381,0.3072,2.9035,1.0639,2.2779,5.2988,4.8449,0.094,0.9506,0.5533,4.4212,0.0591,0.6078,0.0117,0.2543,0.47,18.2801,2.0645,6.0397,1.1024,1.9031,4.9596,0.0282,17.0313,7.6407,5.2674,5.4905,4.5334,2.8306,0.1692,4.292,0.7734,0.0949,2.3866,3.1261,2.225,1.697,0.8305,1.8026,0.1006,2.7432,0.9699,1.3099,2.0296,0.1069,3.6462,3.1627,7.1015,6.6412,4.4406,2.1056,1.2191,8.9769,0.1647,1.9388,4.1246,3.2136,4.5513,3.8447,0.0006,0.0795,0.0122,0.3873,2.111,1.6915,0.0419,1.0306,2.0778,0.0007,2.3907,0.3264,1.9882,4.6354,2.2436,6.2395,3.1924,1.6025,5.8607,3.2966,3.3417,4.8597,5.7469,2.4759,0.0005,0.0077,0.0504,3.7258,0.2886,0.004,1.9062,3.6894,3.7946,2.7351,1.7532,1.5371,2.5877,0.0143,4.0159,2.624,5.591,3.7639,0.2359,0.4182,4.8206,0.013,0.0002,0.0003,5.5156,0.1614,3.8237,3.2047,1.0886,0.9422,4.3563,9.4571,1.9692,4.1727,0.031,0.2494,1.1332,1.397,2.2608,0.4668,2.0874,7.5323,0.3556,0.1242,6.2663,1.3403,2.6161,2.1846,5.4106,0.2414,1.7983,1.1826,1.8849,3.4807,4.8785,2.82,3.1243,0.8913,3.3084,5.4155,0.9616,3.25,1.8721,2.1721,5.6979,5.8968,0.9426,3.5026,2.7492,0.7181,1.7559,0.7635,3.4906,3.1667,0.0508,3.9339,1.8936,1.4385,1.5049,2.2449,3.9553,0.2106,0.1615,8.469,4.5459,0.1212,3.1021,2.6954,3.312,6.2373,5.4047,7.2732,7.7881,0.0338,1.1792,1.377,3.3526,0.0795,5.2554,6.0001,4.0288,0.0611,3.7551,1.5533,5.1635,6.8879,0.8301,5.7256,6.1866,0.1299,4.3037,0.2856,4.0943,3.9101,0.0211,2.7333,0.0179,0.1276,0.0511,0.654,0.505,4.6736,5.3197,1.2569,2.0925,5.1231,2.2455,2.6361,0.0008,0.1123,0.0584,3.6916,2.2414,0.5899,7.5465,6.6509,0.033,1.7253,1.1486,1.757,4.7151,1.0198,6.2814,4.1036,0.7677,0.2388,6.3182,2.4961,3.1121,4.9133,0.1525,2.259,2.1811,4.8236,6.5877,4.4641,4.236,5.5998,0.97,2.8163,0.0242,0.7534,0.4793,0.5804,2.7067,2.4843,0.1411,3.615,1.5178,1.9379,3.4423,0.5767,4.7879,0.3776,5.0397,0.072,0.0026,7.2538,1.8369,0.5221,2.1782,0.1194,4.9381,0.7823,0.2582,5.8838,1.5534,0.4712,1.2566,5.2049,1.5687,2.1623,0.4446,0.0537,4.2409,1.5731,2.9467,1.6257,2.2732,0.275,1.7823,2.0102,7.0467,0.0726,2.422,0.1749,0.3406,1.7823,0.8067,0.2213,4.3896,0.1433]}

Raza Mehmood Khan, 40, a member of the Pakistan People\u2019s Movement ( POM ), a political party group that is working to organize minority groups, disappeared after going to an anti-terrorist training camp in the city\u2019s Mughal suburb on Sunday night, the friend said. \u2018 Raza went to the anti-terrorism training camp as a student in the area on Monday, \u2019 the man told reporters, asking not to be named as he was still unaware of the girl\u2019s whereabouts. Police have so far been unable to get any information about the man. His whereabouts have not been reported either, police said. On Sunday morning, Khan was seen driving away a car in the area\u2019s Mughal complex, a government-run housing complex for low-profile families. \u2018 He has a car which he drives to work with, and he was seen on Sunday morning driving away his car after working, \u2019 the friend said. Pakistani army spokesman Jassirullah Sarwat confirmed that Raza\u2019s car had been seen driving off the area, but did not offer any further information. Khan has held several demonstrations against the war in Afghanistan and the killings of civilians, including students, by security forces. Pakistan has for much of the past three decades had a civil government, but since September 11, 2001, has been fighting a war against militants in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

Russia banned the wholesale import of","text":"One thousand French goats have found a new home in Russia s Ural mountains as a local company bets on producing European-style cheeses no longer available for import. Russia banned the wholesale import of cheeses from the EU in 2008, after failing to agree on a deal to ensure the quality of imported milk. But the embargo was lifted in 2010 and most of the country now enjoys a good supply of European cheeses from various producers. But there are still about 800,000 imported cheeses remaining at home to compete with the more cheaply imported ones from China, Iran and, of course, India. As the company, Agafay, has said on its website, it can now use the money it has saved on imported cheeses to import Russian cheeses. Cheese production has increased steadily, but sales of European cheeses are down as the prices of local cheeses have been rising in recent years. So the French goat dairy, Agafay, is trying to make its own European-style cheese from local milk, but the company is still hoping to have foreign cheese suppliers, including one from France, come on board. The Russian market is worth an estimated 1.5bn Euros a year. It is being opened up again and dairy and cheese production in Russia is on track to break the 100 million tonnes milk\/year milestone by the end of this year. The new French company, Agafay, now has a deal to produce French-style cheeses in Russia, where only French brands are imported from France. The company says it hopes to start producing its cheeses from local milk by next year - a welcome move for the local producers but a little disappointing for many Russians who would prefer import products to French imports.

In a previous verdict, the district court convicted Skelos of receiving stolen property, but reduced his sentence from 10 years\u2019 probation to 6 months in jail. He was released from prison last month in good standing after serving nearly half of the original sentence.\nSkelos, who was the first Republican in New York history to serve in the state Senate, said he lost his political career after becoming a lawyer and focusing on environmental issues.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the court found my entire career, my family\u2019s career, based on the fact that I was on the right side of history \u2014 the only good thing the New York State Criminal Appellate Division did for me on this case was to take my political career away from me,\u201d he said in a statement.\nSkelos was not present in court Tuesday for the ruling, and he said he would appeal to the Supreme Court.\nIn an interview, Skelos acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision could make it difficult for judges to apply criminal law to political issues, but argued that the case had already been reviewed by the lower courts.","token_len":356,"entropy":[6.9563,0.6281,0.0806,0.0846,7.0414,0.0201,2.6054,1.7172,4.4066,0.0254,1.5313,3.8827,0.3176,3.1428,4.1499,0.5753,3.9107,5.3931,2.436,0.0686,5.359,1.0249,0.1401,0.0013,1.3552,5.3519,1.8365,5.3858,4.8421,0.0007,0.0044,0.0012,0.1985,0.004,1.2849,0.8985,7.3402,0.6169,8.9186,4.4413,3.3692,7.6094,0.8683,4.1615,4.3431,0.7577,0.2418,16.3851,1.2894,4.5895,0.0511,1.9019,6.4561,2.3995,0.2406,0.6187,8.4053,0.1079,0.1324,4.6422,1.2901,0.0356,0.0136,3.0217,2.0465,0.0002,0.0056,17.2738,6.4961,5.6212,1.8931,2.2721,1.7821,2.3776,0.1704,5.4811,0.0893,7.6488,3.2229,5.6229,3.3272,0.524,5.0824,4.8599,7.8418,2.0902,0.8585,2.0355,0.0044,0.0045,1.8337,1.2844,1.1885,3.3995,0.6368,5.062,7.1721,3.069,4.6629,0.1607,0.0031,2.0493,1.7392,6.2453,2.3798,0.17,2.1607,5.4358,5.2722,2.639,0.9781,3.6643,0.3989,1.4064,3.4722,3.0418,2.446,3.1456,2.4951,5.4942,6.1579,0.3726,1.0313,4.6586,0.6712,4.5489,1.5248,0.0003,0.0045,0.7978,5.1278,4.5839,0.8149,2.0188,1.961,5.5579,1.1614,0.5848,3.0548,3.214,0.3508,11.0325,0.1773,7.5049,0.1883,5.525,1.6373,2.7027,2.1287,0.4471,3.6494,0.8948,2.2212,1.6136,0.4492,3.6673,1.7941,4.6967,5.4537,0.9494,3.1281,1.3219,3.5809,4.6979,0.6133,1.3308,4.9903,0.5652,0.2807,0.2154,1.5266,0.0034,0.004,2.554,0.9291,1.7422,3.7868,2.9431,4.1383,2.2619,4.3777,0.0187,4.0057,0.0801,2.7547,2.7419,0.7755,1.9893,1.414,0.3104,3.1388,0.9583,5.869,0.823,4.0358,1.1652,1.7301,5.246,1.5198,4.7148,1.6384,8.1449,0.6503,7.1203,0.6119,0.6015,0.6708,5.8103,6.0984,8.1692,0.5614,3.7902,0.002,1.7716,0.7455,0.041,2.1005,3.8603,2.1639,11.3339,7.0453,1.9971,3.5325,1.667,2.9534,6.5777,1.1209,5.6525,4.5421,0.4678,5.9617,0.2311,2.3995,3.5774,0.091,0.3475,1.5906,4.9685,0.8496,4.227,0.1534,0.0833,0.9977,5.3749,3.1387,3.8107,5.8042,1.8694,5.1431,4.137,0.1626,1.5818,7.623,7.1086,0.4153,0.0039,1.5588,2.5502,2.5929,0.4116,5.8086,2.4146,1.1091,0.5861,1.3427,3.8557,2.0944,3.7018,0.2982,1.9365,0.9026,0.1033,1.9799,5.9017,7.37,5.2484,0.23,2.0745,0.3153,0.3856,0.3436,0.3503,1.4197,0.005,0.0045,2.2029,3.6027,3.6063,1.7947,2.1768,2.4524,3.2928,0.8941,2.5605,1.2378,2.1418,2.0149,2.7254,0.4417,2.3988,1.9767,2.6005,0.2475,1.8151,0.0164,0.5018,0.5095,2.9927,2.9404,1.069,1.6355,0.9225,0.0005,0.0055,4.3301,0.8658,1.984,4.7908,0.1335,0.0013,0.0017,0.7223,0.0028,11.1492,1.8847,0.6792,0.9844,3.7351,4.4969,1.2159,1.6057,0.2973,6.3742,0.2541,3.9998,3.9669,1.9079,1.0876,4.206,4.1448,1.6044,1.1196,4.2254,0.3976,1.4977,2.7574,3.5424,2.9688,0.9052,3.7986,0.7171,0.8513,4.1664,1.2943,0.726]}

Now he says he wants to negotiate, but only if it\u2019s just to stop from impeachment, it doesn\u2019t makes a difference to him what will happen, he\u2019s just using a lame excuse to hide the fact that he\u2019s just a jerk.","token_len":357,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,4.5444,1.9909,8.7587,2.8298,0.2596,1.0053,0.0006,0.0001,0.0002,0.0,0.0,1.7536,1.8998,1.196,0.2765,7.1112,0.1743,1.0558,3.2427,0.5357,1.5427,1.9525,2.9746,0.0004,0.0195,0.0421,3.9706,0.0011,0.1524,0.4153,0.9791,0.0479,0.139,0.3667,3.4926,2.6225,4.8267,0.5863,2.1578,6.5855,1.4891,1.6123,0.0112,5.6093,1.2828,5.1991,0.0013,3.2969,4.5785,4.2856,2.4631,4.8909,1.1389,2.8999,6.1483,1.2862,0.8694,0.0012,0.4245,0.6355,1.2085,0.8071,1.0003,0.2287,0.0338,5.3093,0.0,2.0545,2.0865,0.0095,3.9371,4.4092,2.6249,2.796,1.0011,5.5308,0.1545,2.3975,3.5712,2.3049,1.8795,0.582,6.5006,3.9329,0.7822,0.6492,20.0954,3.2124,4.949,7.9395,6.1838,1.3459,3.0458,16.0152,8.0533,1.006,6.8143,2.1578,4.5192,1.6198,2.1574,2.622,1.2783,2.8877,0.2935,0.0148,1.3533,0.5259,0.4257,0.5521,4.8184,0.9662,1.0669,7.5805,3.0777,1.5583,3.7092,2.3222,5.8183,2.1438,1.2679,0.1327,0.0041,5.3484,7.8424,4.3891,5.7758,3.0551,5.2849,2.2506,1.9382,1.1331,3.91,1.1078,0.7719,0.0323,0.0034,2.489,0.1652,5.0199,1.2064,4.3513,2.0374,1.6205,0.9538,0.0067,0.0038,4.0177,1.4833,0.9529,6.4698,1.442,6.427,2.9933,4.5938,4.9127,4.0741,1.3162,1.6241,9.8179,7.6914,2.5284,3.5791,2.6291,1.1672,4.3182,4.6161,2.5775,0.3863,0.8024,2.4819,4.5357,1.1856,3.9187,1.1497,1.7765,2.2555,4.2719,10.2728,0.3689,0.0324,2.9677,7.5627,1.8994,3.3808,0.8446,4.7771,5.8891,0.736,1.7555,2.8557,11.7765,2.0361,1.3246,0.0212,1.584,4.9274,4.9158,2.1383,2.8888,4.1274,2.8398,1.8276,1.1435,3.0055,0.0421,8.776,3.0646,4.5676,3.686,0.831,0.9957,0.0088,0.0227,2.373,1.3696,3.5769,5.2533,0.5312,0.0613,0.9634,4.6201,0.7318,1.4681,4.8375,1.1687,2.8726,0.051,2.6733,4.1126,2.7776,1.581,1.429,4.5971,2.6632,4.8429,3.0509,4.3915,0.3176,0.18,0.3811,2.3062,4.8753,2.164,1.7928,8.3515,1.1756,1.3355,2.6015,5.6524,1.7107,4.0374,4.4147,0.7406,3.9436,0.5854,1.0177,1.3789,4.8575,7.7299,0.0207,6.7081,5.3729,6.5822,6.2178,5.6043,1.6917,3.558,1.5698,0.9854,1.4826,5.4608,3.7006,2.8036,0.7124,2.2339,1.4359,0.8737,1.8435,2.0342,1.2726,0.018,0.0057,0.9233,0.0762,3.3372,4.9521,1.8386,0.4694,3.9109,1.2707,5.7388,1.6545,5.4014,1.1397,2.5641,0.3414,6.2587,2.6795,1.9548,4.525,1.8427,2.1523,1.6155,0.0395,0.0204,5.6224,3.6429,5.3116,6.6521,9.4959,1.7425,3.802,2.6863,0.2308,0.0296,0.3924,7.8775,3.3913,0.5928,2.9566,1.5753,4.7689,5.3009,0.1446,2.2277,1.747,1.4656,0.003,0.0057,3.5648,5.8731,3.5499,6.1863,0.1265,1.1298,4.5233,2.4396,1.0711,0.4627,0.3122,1.8821,0.0066,0.0231,4.2978,2.3776,4.6665,1.0015]}

Rouhani","text":"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday all Muslim nations should work together to defend the rights of Palestinians following Donald Trump s decision last week to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. Rouhani s remarks came as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Thursday that Trump s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem is a symbolic issue to Israel and a political decision for America.\nRouhani spoke at a rally in Tehran to commemorate the birth of Iranian revolutionary leader, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was killed near the frontlines in the Iran war in 1978. Trump said in a statement on Friday he intended to place the U.S. Embassy in Israel s Jerusalem in a symbolic move as he pushes the U.S. government to move to Israel s capital. Rouhani did not respond when asked about the remarks Thursday. Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital was met with condemnation among most countries in the West and condemnation from Arab leaders who have denounced Trump as a Zionist. Rouhani said the Jewish people have a claim to Jerusalem because it is their holy city. Israel has not renounced its claims to Jerusalem and the other occupied Palestinian territories and there is no reason for the Iranian government to support Israel s position, Rouhani said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Jerusalem was in fact a holy city for all religions and that it was a historical and geographical mistake to declare Jerusalem as Israel s capital and said it was very significant to make a rightful decision based on historical and political reality. We expect that the US does not make a mistake because they have committed many mistakes in the past, Zarif told the international community Thursday. Donald Trump, president of the United States. We hope not, I am praying they should not make a mistake.","token_len":357,"entropy":[6.9161,2.9378,1.5941,0.0105,3.5079,1.3887,2.2673,7.896,6.6179,2.3658,0.9574,3.4051,0.5611,0.3899,4.9328,1.246,2.2521,0.1251,3.9973,7.4804,8.5457,0.0045,11.3851,2.0771,6.7214,0.4536,0.2335,0.7212,0.1725,0.0178,1.131,11.6586,0.1144,0.2272,4.1644,7.8501,2.4676,1.3909,1.673,5.151,2.2824,0.0449,0.3949,0.0005,0.0001,0.0,0.0001,1.8149,6.4261,0.7187,2.5805,2.533,1.1989,1.726,3.9097,0.5352,0.6558,0.0013,0.0352,0.0271,0.4068,1.3842,0.0727,2.896,1.6017,6.1207,7.6399,3.3948,3.7308,1.3947,3.4922,4.3407,3.3639,3.2537,5.7442,0.7522,1.4079,12.8101,0.0445,0.0,4.2727,1.5317,0.868,3.4511,0.5718,1.4717,2.8462,3.4083,0.3641,4.496,0.5894,4.5101,5.1169,0.5492,2.6918,5.767,0.567,0.2584,0.0013,0.0763,0.0023,0.0001,0.8791,1.1288,1.2229,2.3878,6.5169,1.0098,7.222,3.1083,1.4966,1.0967,4.1355,5.1835,1.7627,5.5599,0.3313,4.2188,2.5088,2.4332,0.8458,1.1371,2.5065,3.3192,2.831,4.7416,0.0859,5.4323,0.8723,0.732,0.0005,0.0053,0.0162,1.7542,0.4976,2.9159,2.6482,5.0655,3.5501,2.6211,2.0342,3.128,4.1362,1.4987,6.3232,3.3006,1.445,0.0007,0.0171,0.0507,3.5145,0.1479,2.5043,3.3224,4.3953,2.2521,1.9579,0.4664,3.8313,4.2891,0.0388,4.8078,4.6646,0.3059,1.2074,1.3582,3.7479,5.7633,0.6238,3.9691,3.8419,3.302,1.6413,2.8504,0.1201,0.7463,0.1693,0.2685,0.0472,2.1006,2.8073,0.1594,3.501,6.534,5.9957,3.5854,1.6282,0.2384,5.5852,2.4688,6.0703,0.5501,3.9191,1.811,2.2825,2.4071,4.9275,1.5671,3.6701,0.8615,5.9161,1.0961,4.4532,1.3695,2.1159,6.2497,1.8856,2.3231,1.6656,7.9047,0.598,2.2455,4.3692,1.6415,0.6584,2.1777,3.2853,1.8499,0.7995,4.993,1.6457,3.5824,5.3036,0.0036,0.7947,3.5853,0.5031,3.1892,1.8217,2.7419,5.7943,4.4798,1.1709,0.6211,3.128,4.9191,0.8187,0.2121,4.0637,1.8045,1.3395,6.3442,0.6581,0.1157,4.8135,3.3367,1.1376,2.6426,3.2973,0.8417,0.1763,0.2122,5.0212,1.3038,0.0658,0.1914,0.0004,0.0002,0.0034,0.0009,1.2053,6.685,2.2665,4.0982,2.6607,1.7543,1.8855,0.6878,3.1698,2.4277,3.9081,0.9486,1.7812,2.4964,1.2353,1.7306,5.4951,1.9153,4.4669,9.0792,1.2015,4.5869,1.8169,1.1839,0.4705,0.0874,0.0486,3.2604,4.7649,2.8571,0.9819,6.4061,5.6244,1.6562,4.7804,2.1881,11.6504,2.2116,4.1677,0.0442,2.9276,1.74,2.2454,4.2305,0.3302,7.9587,5.2919,1.4658,1.3723,4.9856,5.5662,0.2022,4.0447,0.8789,1.9158,4.1517,4.3969,1.8434,5.577,4.1271,1.7294,1.6003,1.2114,0.2848,2.2064,5.2182,0.0011,2.6619,2.5266,5.8741,1.5383,3.8512,0.5186,8.3196,0.0845,3.0204,5.2956,0.3876,0.0354,0.1357,0.0071,4.2076,6.123,3.6628,7.0343,2.5551,4.3471,3.3717,6.1675,6.9767,5.5617,1.9867,1.071,0.3982,0.0761,1.3369]}

Obviously it's going to take a while, but for the sake of the 130-plus other countries, it's worth waiting,\" he said.\n\"Let's start with the fact that I don't hold any grudges and I don't hold any resentment. As a parliamentarian I have to maintain those sorts of things. I was born after the war and had a very vivid memory of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. I remember the pain and the agony of those families when they received the intelligence that their loved ones had been killed and I was part of the British parliament for many years. I made sure we got that information to the families.\n\"I still remember the photograph of the father and grandfather standing together to get the news that their son had been killed there. My hope is that there will come a day when the British parliament's record will be changed as well because it wasn't fair to be silent in the face of such a terrible, sad massacre\", said the London-based party leader.","token_len":358,"entropy":[3.5112,4.1591,5.149,0.0252,0.0115,4.654,1.2596,1.4355,4.1944,0.9659,4.9092,2.0388,0.1342,4.1658,2.0688,3.4639,1.7448,1.3625,0.9432,11.9591,10.1371,6.8102,0.1433,1.0305,0.2288,7.1135,1.1739,1.1638,2.4597,1.0368,3.4993,3.5946,4.7981,0.0002,0.3778,3.8304,0.3003,1.3494,1.3903,4.078,4.4143,4.519,1.1798,6.111,1.7189,3.9789,5.376,0.8077,0.199,0.2089,16.9961,0.0042,1.1479,2.0103,5.3583,6.3066,2.8514,7.5153,0.2029,5.3026,0.5574,0.7459,3.5957,2.2409,3.7015,5.674,1.5733,0.6555,6.9174,2.9923,7.1153,0.8563,0.002,1.5563,2.8428,0.5293,1.2461,2.1286,0.6703,3.2819,3.6179,2.4542,0.6426,3.2736,0.2921,0.8139,0.2066,0.7679,2.7874,3.8358,4.2239,5.9086,0.7042,0.4904,2.2696,0.1591,2.2895,4.0907,7.6795,3.3268,5.7844,4.4319,1.9081,1.0759,1.4704,1.5886,4.7884,0.1398,0.3532,1.0588,3.2056,2.6894,3.3299,1.1373,1.2896,0.3685,4.2458,0.3686,4.4029,1.445,0.8337,0.2274,4.7847,1.174,1.3615,2.1194,2.4532,3.4515,1.6741,2.6736,0.5927,0.6525,4.5984,5.3895,1.2966,6.363,0.0002,0.3602,0.2009,0.5184,0.8714,0.0209,4.8929,7.371,0.5151,0.2581,2.6994,0.5254,4.6233,5.703,2.5651,1.6865,4.4854,0.04,2.4203,1.3905,2.4747,1.7762,0.5438,4.3321,1.2302,1.9618,0.0015,1.1744,11.8664,5.6365,2.5209,3.6075,0.1645,1.4155,2.1513,1.0942,5.1106,6.6292,5.5265,0.4095,0.4639,0.1806,0.1473,1.9226,4.9971,0.5967,3.8411,1.1711,1.0583,4.0725,0.0461,3.152,3.2491,0.0006,5.0786,0.9305,2.2097,0.114,0.0001,3.7772,1.224,1.7999,0.0003,3.0971,0.3129,3.9256,1.9637,4.6923,1.5143,7.5594,0.0657,1.8515,2.0614,1.728,6.1603,6.2817,4.798,0.001,2.5456,1.1287,1.4026,4.4246,5.4477,5.8278,0.8851,1.6363,1.1791,4.8009,1.6271,2.5746,7.857,1.1466,0.3337,1.4577,3.9409,0.0164,0.1817,0.0403,0.0062,0.1862,0.001,0.606,0.944,1.2737,1.9774,1.936,4.1497,1.2439,1.231,3.7787,1.264,2.3062,4.5676,4.6817,0.9786,4.9516,1.4465,9.3754,0.6917,2.3465,2.1253,0.0476,1.1094,0.2163,0.7765,2.618,2.6816,2.2232,5.2452,0.0123,1.3826,2.623,7.368,4.7572,3.2491,0.1972,0.9228,1.496,6.0604,2.7984,3.7894,2.6716,2.4035,1.5935,3.2532,0.7351,5.0238,2.0078,1.3905,0.0918,1.3078,5.562,2.6447,0.9679,9.1919,0.738,0.8265,7.7909,1.5578,2.9142,3.143,2.2493,4.682,5.2635,1.2169,1.3638,2.2441,1.1816,2.8188,0.6481,0.2301,0.4143,6.5066,0.8423,3.7032,3.4548,0.3029,0.1443,3.8847,0.4283,3.0248,0.1797,1.069,0.278,1.4234,0.3048,4.9129,6.3359,5.8054,1.1976,0.6473,2.4506,4.2662,1.5815,4.1065,2.287,4.912,0.0005,4.66,1.0158,5.278,4.3187,3.0579,0.9758,1.9336,0.0027,1.3007,1.1773,2.0111,4.2549,4.6261,4.4162,8.0279,3.5314,3.0381,3.5375,2.7816,1.649,8.1668,1.0187,0.4186]}

Those who do not want to do those civil services will receive a $ 700 monthly allowance from the military ministry.\nAlassane Ouattara's government is trying to cut the military because of the country's high budget deficit and the pressure of the crisis in neighboring Liberia, which sees hundreds of thousands of refugees.\nIn addition to paying soldiers, the Government also agreed to increase pensions.

Trump \u2019 s comments are expected on Tuesday during a summit with the leaders of other world powers in Vienna to tackle Syria., Trump said on June 18 that he would take a hard line against Iran, which has been condemned by the international community for its nuclear program. After that statement, Iran conducted three sets of ballistic and anti-ship missile tests, which were later confirmed by the Iranian Ministry of Defense. \u201c Today, Iran and its regime are attempting to destabilize the region, \u201d Trump said in a statement issued by the White House, pointing to the regime \u2019 s \u201c destabilizing actions and provocations against Iraq and Israel, \u201d and supporting \u201c terror operations against the states of the region. \u201d\nIt seems like we live in a time and a country where young people want to be free from work, want to spend as much time as possible doing things instead of being employed, but we can\u2019t stop the economy, and nobody has power to tell anyone how long they can live. There are all kinds of free things out there, but none of them seem to be good on paper. There are jobs like babysitting, but if an employer doesn\u2019t like them or doesn\u2019t like the job, it\u2019s really a hassle. So this could actually make things more comfortable, but it seems like too many people may not even care. I am not sure how long the person can stay out of trouble for, but I can see it working well for someone whose work is not really for them.","token_len":358,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,4.4868,3.7273,4.7964,4.9481,0.0023,0.0049,0.0615,10.3491,0.158,4.2497,13.6205,7.7592,8.2149,4.7591,2.0533,2.1748,7.5026,0.2211,11.8201,3.3725,6.0488,1.0504,6.5142,0.5288,5.7947,4.4873,4.2727,1.1523,0.001,0.5592,4.0715,5.8021,2.137,2.1992,2.3165,0.7637,0.0008,0.6054,2.5027,0.155,3.756,8.2575,1.5839,4.6696,5.7106,2.9525,2.7919,5.0119,2.6479,4.1775,0.7297,4.9818,1.2633,3.9632,1.4487,0.0195,4.8145,1.6396,0.1344,2.1385,4.0714,5.2013,6.5645,4.5852,8.8961,4.1968,1.8678,2.6296,6.9326,3.6702,0.7926,1.1446,1.2829,4.3494,1.846,2.9616,0.4381,0.9434,0.8993,1.8803,2.9028,1.6254,2.0691,8.5827,0.383,1.3769,2.5775,0.0013,0.7682,0.3979,1.3428,0.267,0.5441,5.8954,4.2202,2.5814,0.2235,3.1115,5.2701,3.9687,9.5165,0.0022,1.0648,6.1159,6.941,0.0052,0.5447,0.9561,0.0616,2.0431,2.7374,2.1207,4.093,3.7212,0.412,0.4506,5.9475,4.7424,0.0144,1.0688,0.5678,4.8881,1.2326,6.1125,0.5518,2.7041,2.9897,1.7908,5.3826,1.9015,5.6253,0.0893,4.8206,0.0069,0.5569,1.0756,1.7936,7.8452,4.4508,3.753,0.5145,2.0056,0.7965,1.5968,3.5223,2.5832,0.864,0.5874,0.0014,2.2244,6.1357,0.2392,1.3555,5.3434,5.8013,2.643,0.4727,13.3492,1.7273,7.398,1.1554,2.8181,2.8756,5.9759,0.0051,3.3847,4.6114,0.7899,6.7491,2.0048,4.4426,1.4946,1.4325,4.9099,4.8816,0.1874,3.8597,4.4542,1.5154,1.4081,8.1762,0.7437,2.2063,1.5576,0.6567,2.1102,3.1061,3.0927,10.7567,4.8507,2.7484,3.2874,5.5457,0.0612,0.4363,1.8963,5.0617,1.3817,5.9296,0.3558,8.5929,0.394,3.9242,0.3385,1.7417,3.1802,1.594,8.692,0.926,6.5,0.2271,6.7524,5.6669,0.2832,0.4332,0.682,0.3062,4.0625,1.9547,6.1624,0.0184,2.5701,5.5755,2.2718,3.7544,3.8905,3.0999,9.0522,4.3889,2.6462,3.9308,2.9981,6.0254,2.6065,2.141,7.2699,3.5567,7.1459,0.9658,3.1457,5.825,2.2283,6.7109,1.2719,1.2451,2.8627,1.4838,4.3695,1.2083,5.7688,0.615,0.0034,6.7349,4.8321,3.1723,0.0086,1.1855,1.4942,5.2364,0.3124,0.2272,4.9085,0.3333,1.0414,4.7878,7.2431,5.7899,0.4805,3.2744,0.8433,5.341,6.0956,6.983,0.3531,0.9034,2.5434,4.3673,6.2523,2.6161,2.401,3.9483,0.377,2.1255,3.3403,3.02,3.5753,2.1014,0.8444,0.1108,0.1327,2.6351,2.1213,2.414,0.7412,2.6962,3.6369,0.2137,0.2086,4.8379,3.5918,5.1939,0.9862,3.1613,4.3776,5.5299,5.5625,3.8122,2.3887,3.1125,6.7458,2.2088,2.0295,1.4033,3.002,0.3335,7.0879,1.7057,1.2308,5.8442,1.282,3.6215,3.7235,1.4156,3.2276,4.1072,1.7802,1.5468,1.9101,3.1805,2.7059,6.8406,2.881,1.66,3.8574,0.4112,1.8202,4.079,1.3265,3.0687,1.4658,3.1642,3.0143,2.5124,4.8118,3.9553,0.8006,4.618,5.167,3.7353,1.4,2.7057,3.3011,3.4095,1.1243,0.4926]}

The Supreme Court has, for decades, held that the president of the United States cannot overturn an election or try to force a citizen to vote against their political beliefs. The courts have been extremely clear on this issue. If the plaintiffs are seeking redress, they should seek it through the courts\u2019 criminal justice system.\u201d\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup, the presiding judge in the case, called the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cwholly unpersuasive.\u201d\n\u201cThe plaintiffs should have filed their complaint in the federal courts seeking relief from illegal state action that harms their rights to vote. Such lawsuits would have provided a proper venue to litigate the issue,\u201d Alsup wrote.\nIn a statement, Lamberth\u2019s office said it was \u201csaddened and heartbroken\u201d that Alsup voted to allow the defamation lawsuit to proceed.","token_len":358,"entropy":[8.5834,0.966,1.5187,2.5373,0.3784,10.7943,2.9334,3.106,1.6136,1.3914,1.4048,9.2313,5.2783,0.704,3.0697,0.3825,1.5223,0.0042,7.9003,0.5135,2.3098,0.8252,1.2198,3.5829,0.7636,0.0087,4.9812,1.456,0.9745,3.3335,0.7842,3.6841,0.0002,0.0021,0.0172,0.1034,1.1784,4.6169,1.1812,0.9084,8.3797,1.1405,0.3307,0.137,22.8858,4.549,6.2155,4.5379,1.323,2.6938,1.5183,0.0031,3.9108,0.4317,4.3321,0.054,0.9522,1.0818,3.1752,1.1623,4.4113,0.0388,2.8051,1.7239,3.426,0.4748,0.7964,5.6529,2.395,4.0426,2.0598,0.0005,0.3711,5.8138,4.4477,6.6545,4.4154,2.5715,4.179,4.2677,0.8129,0.0061,0.3083,4.085,1.7367,4.4964,0.0017,0.9573,4.5814,3.1096,6.93,1.6781,7.4707,9.4033,0.3622,3.6102,2.0004,7.0632,4.2198,0.5482,4.7284,8.7024,8.1437,3.3436,1.9351,6.2274,1.1534,0.9072,0.605,0.4893,0.2242,14.1865,8.4719,7.636,3.3356,2.0759,3.4449,1.8699,5.5284,0.9654,6.1231,3.4698,2.9289,2.743,0.9905,1.6707,0.9671,4.2964,0.0781,5.7763,0.9681,3.5378,2.4839,2.1356,1.0608,5.3066,1.7665,7.6495,7.8882,6.7216,0.0019,0.0022,0.6935,1.6692,1.1117,2.7488,0.0291,1.8635,4.761,0.0012,2.906,0.0822,6.2041,0.1495,1.5769,1.1263,2.2675,3.9534,0.3116,1.9004,3.3001,5.4546,4.5105,0.0087,6.5209,3.5482,1.1643,3.1405,6.1592,1.2069,1.6236,1.3256,1.3603,2.4735,4.4063,0.0022,1.3145,6.4186,2.7454,2.453,0.0112,1.5533,0.0491,1.3195,1.4486,6.571,0.0674,0.0231,0.0011,2.3348,5.8892,1.4384,0.0616,4.9447,6.1725,0.0959,4.5176,0.9693,6.3846,0.3652,1.3222,3.2872,3.6719,6.0399,2.2004,0.4464,2.7777,5.0547,0.335,3.7921,4.9267,3.041,2.2146,0.4944,1.8175,1.0661,5.0595,0.9807,0.9038,1.6649,5.0114,5.3235,0.9902,0.9084,1.4987,2.1821,3.7255,2.352,1.2381,1.5067,7.9768,6.3205,11.6908,3.3801,1.2685,0.9423,3.2764,4.7784,0.4913,5.176,0.0308,0.0031,0.0041,0.0862,0.2217,2.7453,1.564,0.0391,2.2947,3.0481,2.9961,0.1473,1.4824,0.1647,0.3546,0.1232,5.1538,0.5495,1.8215,14.9266,2.8793,2.4284,8.4331,1.7469,9.0407,0.1916,6.434,0.0499,0.0,0.0085,3.9676,2.5067,1.6532,0.8359,1.7755,0.3617,1.4672,0.5373,5.6907,2.6349,3.9415,1.9587,1.9189,1.6575,1.3882,3.04,3.3575,6.3193,2.7985,1.3961,7.7772,6.3725,2.2511,3.9807,6.5959,1.2029,2.351,1.9172,1.4755,1.539,5.5028,3.7668,3.1729,2.4392,5.5518,1.6597,7.7634,3.0881,1.5311,4.1478,0.014,2.1164,2.689,1.854,4.7581,1.1127,1.7675,0.0003,0.546,0.4959,0.5408,3.1825,1.6679,1.5364,0.7436,3.3686,0.0027,0.0033,7.9557,1.9963,3.4631,1.5726,0.7361,2.1266,1.5334,11.513,0.4318,4.5418,2.2639,0.016,1.9114,3.7492,2.4205,2.7317,2.1998,1.7208,4.3208,0.0039,7.495,0.6606,3.5029,0.6364,8.7088,0.6413,0.91,0.1412,0.5352]}

Tom Cotton (R-AR) told The Washington Post he wants to know what was known about the firing of Sally Yates at the time. He said he has a \u201cgood intuition\u201d that Yates\u2019 ouster came as a result of her being asked to resign by the President, and that the Attorney General\u2019s office should be doing additional investigations.\nYates resigned before the impeachment hearings in the Senate. Her departure raised questions about the timing of the firing and whether it was related to the President\u2019s push for the Russia investigation to go forward.\nThe Post\u2019s Bob Woodward wrote last week that Yates told Trump that it was up to her to quit if he no longer wanted her to lead the DOJ. His article claims that Trump demanded that Yates do so as a condition for continuing to appoint her to lead the DOJ.

Speaking","text":"FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Thursday he has \u201c not detected any whiff of interference \u201d by the White House into the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Speaking on Fox News, Wray said : \u201c we have a good partnership with the FBI, a very strong partnership with the CIA, and for both the FBI and the CIA to have a very powerful relationship with Mr Trump does not mean that he has any influence whatsoever on their operations and investigations. \u201c He said his investigation into whether the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Trump colluded with Russia has been \u201c thorough and open-source. \u201c There is no question that there have been efforts over and over again for over two years to try to sway our investigation into whether there has been any collusion and any meddling \u201d, Mr Wray told MSNBC. Mr Wray\u2019s comments followed news that the White House had released a lengthy document last month to intelligence agencies, containing details of meetings between top officials in the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In December, the director of national intelligence concluded that \u201c while investigations of Russian influence over the election had started, no evidence was found that any serious steps were taken to interfere in that election. \u201d In response to Fox News, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said : \u201c the statement that the DNI has not detected any interference by the administration has never stood up to scrutiny. Mr Wray\u2019s statement was also a response to a series of questions from Fox News Channel\u2019s Tucker Carlson over the ongoing investigation. Ms Sanders said : \u201c obviously the President has asked the intelligence agencies for their report on the investigation and the intelligence agencies have done some independent work, which is public, which we look forward to seeing. \u201c","token_len":360,"entropy":[8.7538,5.2801,0.3017,0.0096,2.7288,2.2485,2.1589,2.7353,2.6934,15.6205,8.5003,7.4353,7.8636,0.4901,9.8496,0.0567,6.9695,6.335,7.5654,3.3806,1.513,3.4182,0.0015,5.4788,1.0395,4.2019,0.9808,0.485,1.0136,1.4482,0.1522,0.1517,0.4065,1.7566,0.1013,0.2934,7.4689,2.0569,2.0767,0.0702,1.0322,1.3853,0.001,0.4817,8.1521,2.1612,3.6715,5.4334,1.309,3.2433,4.116,8.3229,0.6917,0.4235,1.3155,1.7869,4.9977,2.9005,2.1231,1.7512,0.7338,0.4025,3.1398,0.7391,1.1254,6.4916,6.1659,3.0833,1.2403,0.1017,0.3954,0.3808,1.6851,3.3296,1.7385,3.8663,6.3761,1.2947,1.6748,6.4778,4.56,6.0533,0.6793,2.8951,0.9175,3.2502,1.7703,1.5329,2.7641,3.6139,1.7715,4.3351,3.6705,3.2593,2.9664,0.7163,2.9836,0.6457,2.8205,4.6121,4.8892,3.9208,2.0287,3.5625,2.1457,3.643,2.1976,4.5208,1.4713,0.5014,3.8021,2.1954,0.0003,0.058,0.5042,2.9784,1.359,9.4907,0.6591,4.8939,1.1347,4.0812,4.1373,9.0946,0.8295,1.0262,0.0082,4.2641,1.1814,0.6044,3.4053,0.8648,2.0156,2.2599,0.0193,3.9879,5.2822,4.8602,0.0389,0.6724,4.465,4.4143,2.8975,0.6016,0.9563,2.6938,0.7356,6.7075,3.5173,6.5055,1.463,2.4332,1.8641,3.3913,0.0468,1.2643,0.4355,3.8261,4.0825,5.7656,6.2247,0.5242,6.9805,5.5936,5.9519,0.0015,3.7577,5.6496,1.2982,5.2404,1.9207,0.0017,6.8962,7.3256,3.2742,1.3572,4.7591,4.57,1.1973,1.4982,2.361,0.0008,1.4428,4.1553,0.9674,6.5641,4.2664,3.6793,1.7912,3.7758,8.6042,0.9208,3.0594,6.0278,3.1409,1.1188,4.495,0.7778,3.081,1.8466,2.2453,0.5061,0.8973,1.1062,0.2607,0.9152,0.2699,0.9147,3.4982,5.0706,0.2865,1.352,4.4988,0.2323,0.258,0.0003,4.8217,0.2342,10.1097,1.5477,6.35,6.1248,2.2766,0.8813,4.0312,4.2817,0.1226,1.5519,3.415,5.1002,1.0945,3.8173,1.3735,2.8273,1.2351,1.4215,2.4428,6.7126,6.4556,0.9664,0.6628,0.4644,1.9659,1.2114,2.3603,1.4735,0.3883,2.8076,3.3456,2.6992,3.5844,0.7432,5.1389,0.2016,1.9511,2.7996,0.001,1.2302,0.0255,2.0095,1.6996,0.843,3.4489,0.2725,2.1412,3.4086,6.1985,2.0134,1.7695,7.5126,0.0983,2.2268,2.2694,1.3859,0.1566,0.9029,2.1219,0.2999,3.1309,3.0738,4.36,7.7683,1.2844,0.5396,0.2313,1.0581,5.0458,1.3411,0.0116,1.4109,0.2662,0.1535,1.15,2.6498,4.0362,3.7679,2.8472,0.055,1.6586,3.5708,0.0049,1.7748,1.2236,2.6475,0.1173,4.3824,3.6078,2.2092,0.1284,4.6345,0.0006,6.5077,0.9599,7.1843,0.8118,1.8188,6.3413,0.2247,1.246,2.6034,0.163,0.7777,7.0947,2.1421,3.7307,1.4122,3.5959,1.2604,2.2291,2.8981,3.0164,2.762,3.8264,1.5336,1.6946,3.3435,1.9573,2.619,2.1233,1.37,0.638,4.2566,5.6728,5.8798,2.3724,2.391,3.57,1.3914,7.7891,1.7067,3.2656,3.9322,5.2772,0.8449,0.0044,3.7649,0.7673,1.0589,0.4656]}

The attack followed intelligence sharing with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, spokesman Richard Karemire told Reuters. The army spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the operation. The military spokesman did not mention whether civilians were among the casualties.\nKare mire says the operation was \"very successful and it appears\" that all or most of the rebels retreated from the area. \"They had to take refuge somewhere else,\" he said. \"They had no choice, because once the soldiers entered the area, they found all the facilities. They searched the houses, searched the camps, and all the information we had about their movements.\"\nKare mire said the operation resulted in the destruction of weapons and ammunition which had been stored in rebel camps. \"There were AK-47 rifles, RPGs, mortars. Everything was destroyed,\" the spokesman said. \"But we cannot say what the exact number of casualties is. This is an ongoing mission. So they may be injured or killed.\n\"The rebels have retreated and the army came out very strong. Some of them are wounded and some of them may come up with some weapons. We do not know. They are not here right now.\"\nKare mire said that the army was planning additional military operations in the region against rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\"They know we will not back down,\" he said. \"So the rebels are afraid to attack, to come up to this kind of areas.\"\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on June 24, 2018, with the headline 'Ugandan army targets rebel camps'.

Joe Crowley, a Virginia congressman, and James McGovern, now a senior senator from Massachusetts, both of whom have been accused in the past of sexual harassment by women for which they have not yet been found guilty, to resign from their offices if their actions are proven to be illegal.\nThe New York Democrat is one of the two women lawmakers who have testified against Conyers: the other was Rep. Jackie Speier of California.\nSpeier testified that Conyers inappropriately kissed her on her hand and rubbed her arms after she introduced him in 1974 as a woman during a Democratic convention in Denver.\n\u201c John Conyers did, in this case, violate the confidence of a woman that I worked for and took the relationship that we had to something illegal, \u201d Speier said.","token_len":360,"entropy":[6.6403,0.1147,0.0279,0.0514,6.7822,4.0371,1.3743,0.0001,8.5239,6.6912,1.2926,1.4314,0.7702,3.7731,1.775,2.068,3.4691,2.0939,7.901,0.4445,0.6198,0.8504,3.4889,0.4137,0.527,1.8801,0.0182,3.6306,0.7883,2.5452,1.8444,1.6071,4.2396,7.7934,0.8239,3.096,0.8746,0.5575,2.0362,2.8381,1.0832,0.3383,1.2961,0.1136,0.2123,25.905,2.968,1.1685,0.2214,0.741,0.0431,3.4106,6.2564,2.5473,0.7578,4.927,0.1344,2.986,2.6355,3.6446,0.6759,3.2163,1.029,0.0024,3.4025,6.6236,0.0073,0.1381,10.8828,3.2637,3.1642,5.564,1.1482,3.0412,1.6496,3.0289,3.8181,0.2556,4.3665,4.2057,0.8186,3.4441,0.9582,0.3208,4.3051,5.6185,7.4023,4.7431,3.8765,5.9972,4.0812,0.9936,3.1275,0.016,3.0054,3.0285,1.7172,3.0499,1.5002,4.4384,5.6112,0.6125,5.9011,0.6694,0.4396,1.0875,6.7755,3.1072,5.2228,0.7602,3.6543,0.0178,0.258,0.2042,15.9839,0.0493,0.0045,1.1964,1.3344,2.3873,4.0374,0.0053,1.4407,2.0998,1.3682,6.0171,0.0178,1.2019,2.1698,0.2562,0.2489,2.4454,0.7522,1.7082,4.2651,6.1893,1.9662,6.2049,0.949,0.7367,6.6238,0.0,0.0312,2.1507,0.051,6.4462,0.375,0.0431,0.06,0.0691,2.3207,1.6058,1.7631,0.5743,0.878,2.7715,2.2469,4.7747,1.3495,3.7946,6.1789,6.0363,0.7848,2.3061,1.8564,1.8303,0.2125,0.3097,10.5816,1.8638,0.0014,3.849,3.8113,2.5749,1.4046,3.1509,4.216,2.896,1.4114,1.7518,3.0333,0.71,3.5798,1.105,2.1821,4.6513,0.0455,3.842,1.1542,1.9307,1.7967,2.4281,3.2221,2.3586,1.5877,0.0131,3.2902,7.043,7.1232,0.0118,4.0988,1.3732,1.6085,4.483,4.5206,3.7873,0.7326,0.5696,4.8051,4.6989,0.0633,0.1169,7.3699,1.5833,5.4707,1.842,1.1213,0.3974,0.0344,5.0444,1.8495,0.0441,0.9893,1.512,0.9372,3.8571,0.7152,0.3478,0.1811,1.0105,1.3467,2.9324,3.8098,5.6333,3.7405,0.3122,1.3126,1.7773,2.6857,0.1168,3.9093,0.7607,2.4516,0.2352,0.5904,2.4834,0.8935,3.2339,4.8036,3.6951,4.9979,0.9384,1.2568,0.8819,0.1934,5.9665,0.1517,0.1968,3.5592,5.0465,0.0466,2.122,3.1296,3.1015,0.0401,1.5604,4.1634,2.4545,6.9159,1.5453,1.0821,5.0416,2.1061,0.4992,0.0038,6.4049,2.8279,0.1775,2.9388,2.0819,0.0009,3.1888,0.0097,0.0001,1.4326,0.1575,1.7421,0.7782,7.2162,0.0007,3.5603,1.6895,1.6145,0.0034,3.7004,2.7589,0.1604,1.733,3.8237,5.8232,1.3526,7.3496,0.665,7.3542,4.5279,0.9136,4.6222,0.741,2.79,5.2402,1.8348,0.5195,5.1096,6.8542,0.7115,3.55,3.6572,1.552,4.0014,0.3084,1.2116,9.5702,9.316,7.5787,0.1892,0.0048,6.2049,5.3177,1.2369,10.6637,0.682,0.0642,5.2167,1.2449,7.9166,0.2668,2.1248,1.3457,4.9542,4.3102,4.3591,1.2266,2.4583,5.6723,3.1258,8.2107,4.2416,2.5257,1.1211,2.7846,7.3264,8.1743,1.9975,7.2538,6.6756,6.144,0.0029,1.0801,0.881]}

Nevertheless, private creditors such as Citibank USA have been forced to stop all trading in the Venezuelan debt market.\nMeanwhile, it is not clear if the new sanctions announced by the U.S. are going to help the Venezuelan economy. The opposition and opposition supporters, with support from the opposition U.S. Congress, have been calling for the government to release President Maduro after 20 years in power.\nBut the U.S. has warned that the new sanctions will make this unlikely, because the U.S. administration did not believe that Trump would do anything to help the opposition after the U.S. administration had threatened to impose sanctions.\nNevertheless, Trump did make a promise to the opposition members who were in the U.S. House of Representatives before the inauguration about support after the election. He told the opposition member Adam Schiff that the U.S. administration would do everything possible to help the opposition.","token_len":361,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.1732,3.4091,1.5204,0.0063,0.0,2.1893,2.166,2.2041,0.4754,6.7751,2.7392,2.9047,2.3466,5.0883,3.0117,3.9421,0.16,10.765,0.0311,0.9946,5.2882,3.2056,0.7185,0.4788,0.0,4.3909,5.2773,1.8228,2.1591,17.8562,7.5164,8.6079,3.2005,0.015,3.1704,0.0006,0.0148,0.0384,5.3411,1.9142,5.4588,0.5857,0.3574,14.5666,2.1687,3.9804,3.2601,5.7337,6.1123,6.3981,1.7791,3.6375,4.8375,1.4747,4.9309,0.7653,2.4736,0.2656,1.7812,0.244,3.1447,1.9744,3.8856,1.9977,4.5549,0.0565,0.0001,1.992,1.7026,1.4799,2.7095,0.0545,1.311,0.4198,5.0173,6.1841,9.5279,1.4198,6.4016,4.6658,7.7719,1.3918,2.6091,6.5171,1.3647,1.2288,6.0396,2.6537,1.6294,3.6213,2.8584,2.7121,3.8352,2.1173,0.7343,2.2815,1.4375,0.673,2.2163,4.3196,3.3606,1.6552,5.2543,5.7178,3.1526,2.4278,6.7883,7.3659,3.722,0.0002,0.3903,0.8318,0.2363,6.9109,4.8534,3.3254,9.2367,1.6368,1.0861,7.631,0.9746,1.4782,1.7121,2.1837,0.3076,2.9701,0.0029,0.0021,0.8245,3.9684,2.8801,0.6666,2.0577,1.4738,2.2424,0.0006,0.7104,0.0549,0.0193,1.6252,6.0801,2.0432,2.6628,1.3563,1.1366,3.7498,1.1929,1.0048,0.4357,2.5903,5.7721,2.2372,1.6334,5.1155,2.0419,1.9974,0.8179,2.7864,3.7388,0.0965,0.5097,4.7786,3.8679,4.9997,5.3572,1.457,2.9585,6.1894,2.8746,1.0492,8.4423,0.0115,7.6551,3.7012,4.829,0.0015,3.938,1.1545,0.0003,7.3932,3.356,2.0226,4.1189,0.1283,4.5899,5.7784,5.7575,1.4278,1.5981,3.6915,3.0619,1.5652,1.2257,0.2421,6.0636,0.0524,5.5561,1.3986,2.626,0.3029,1.9427,0.8957,1.9018,0.1805,7.339,0.6912,0.4836,2.2147,0.0009,0.0109,0.036,3.4689,2.4769,0.0467,3.818,1.7159,1.4913,1.7375,1.199,2.1374,6.7513,3.2093,2.7691,5.7333,3.8491,4.9809,3.7076,0.0642,1.0595,3.9239,5.5411,0.0361,0.0587,0.4147,1.9128,0.4192,0.7487,1.8504,4.0202,0.1372,1.5976,2.9014,0.2618,4.4277,4.8466,1.6309,4.6931,6.8878,0.9012,0.3589,0.4647,0.3943,0.3353,4.8234,1.4213,1.9971,0.0004,0.0041,0.04,2.6926,4.6022,0.5838,1.3188,2.0723,0.1684,1.5068,4.1666,6.3121,5.3893,2.1172,3.2903,1.451,2.0117,0.0004,0.005,0.0657,5.0173,4.4668,0.0564,5.1204,0.8791,7.6507,1.0801,4.2069,1.4068,0.6726,2.0482,1.2198,2.2352,6.0038,1.9707,2.5552,0.0006,0.0039,0.0783,3.8306,3.4567,3.2373,0.4672,2.8503,1.0188,1.8199,0.2608,6.6842,0.0045,3.2758,3.8445,3.748,1.4681,2.0544,0.9623,2.6112,3.0275,5.3468,4.0779,2.8154,2.9506,1.3899,2.3303,0.0005,0.0066,0.0478,2.7873,0.5274,0.0085,5.2705,0.505,4.0478,3.9448,6.3218,7.0031,0.6954,1.7406,0.8194,3.1985,2.9706,2.0411,1.6859,4.7913,8.6791,0.2207,1.0505,1.679,1.0248,0.0005,0.0022,0.0293,3.3755,0.8209,3.4234,0.961,0.8162,0.0985,0.8681,0.9284,0.6451,1.6931]}

Authorities said the package in question at","text":"A suspicious package that prompted an evacuation of a Christmas market in Frankfurt has turned out to be harmless, the city s police said on Twitter. Authorities said the package in question at a Christmas market in the central Frankfurt district on Friday was found to be nothing of significance. \"The package turned out to be harmless during a check,\" the police said in a short statement. \"We have no further information to share at the moment.\" It was unclear what, if any, message was inside. The Christmas market in the district of Sachsenhausen was quickly evacuated after a package, which police said matched a description in media reports citing witnesses, was found at around 3:45 pm. One witness said he had seen a bag with the words \"murder of democracy\" written on it. A police spokeswoman said the \"substance\" of the package was later found to be harmless, according to Reuters. A police spokesman said the package was unexploded dynamite and, while it was unclear if it has been reported as suspicious, it \"accidentally\" blew up on Friday afternoon. He said the package was found near the market, which had been closed to the public since the beginning of December. Some people were not sure who they were dealing with when the package appeared, and one of them tried to put it down. At around 5:15 pm, the Christmas market was closed but it has since reopened. Police say the market was evacuated as some of the people said they thought they might have been a target of terror. The city government did not elaborate on what, if any, weaponry they thought the package might contain.

Jason Smith ( AR ) said CNN on Thursday. \u201d When I see such a thing, I say \u2018 No \u2018 To be true, he said. \u201c I believe that the president has the right to be pro or anti religion. \u201c \u201d I think he\u2019s not going to do something that violates our Constitution, \u201c\u201d said Smith. \u201c I mean when you hear it, it doesn\u2019t seem like a religious thing when you hear it. \u201c So far, Trump has yet to issue a firm statement condemning the violence in Charlottesville, though he initially said that the national right wing is at war with him and the White House, and has yet to condemn the attackers himself.","token_len":363,"entropy":[5.8371,3.5358,2.7075,6.0276,0.4137,0.2512,2.953,4.4966,5.4544,2.6049,0.551,0.3319,0.9796,3.6341,5.26,1.671,1.4899,16.1854,6.6023,7.9085,5.2871,0.2539,1.1255,2.4708,2.4208,0.8182,0.196,3.2685,2.1565,1.2233,1.9079,2.2846,2.4928,8.1659,1.4368,1.2256,1.4082,0.0546,0.0023,1.622,1.335,5.5831,2.9474,2.9236,6.1072,0.7702,0.2529,5.4347,4.0924,5.1322,3.7511,2.1724,4.0479,0.817,3.7815,6.1063,3.953,2.7467,4.3122,1.6059,2.7341,5.8893,5.507,2.3433,2.4515,1.0926,1.7803,2.9602,1.9199,10.0852,5.519,0.3051,7.5182,5.0739,6.851,1.8284,1.9114,3.3693,4.2492,2.1667,4.4115,2.6082,1.4178,4.1744,5.2024,1.7103,2.6821,1.0107,1.9634,0.0246,2.803,1.7279,3.6254,0.4875,3.9656,2.7091,1.2062,2.0485,1.9458,2.983,5.7209,4.1385,4.8127,2.3061,9.3431,0.3526,5.7104,7.1868,1.4488,0.2806,2.7805,3.6667,1.9915,1.0845,1.2651,1.4166,1.4635,2.1253,2.4583,1.8291,3.2608,0.1003,6.8217,6.9886,2.3849,1.1695,6.0191,6.9388,0.1676,4.3315,4.2798,0.9005,2.4996,2.6155,1.4029,2.287,3.0204,4.0926,2.7717,4.7211,2.7799,2.7534,3.117,2.6588,3.8058,1.7644,4.4136,3.0897,1.4899,0.9484,3.3896,2.6481,4.1699,1.0292,5.0722,3.0622,4.5779,4.0165,0.2234,3.0563,4.085,2.4332,2.5894,1.0038,3.9256,0.6726,2.0971,7.7249,0.0739,2.7044,4.1805,1.469,0.6865,1.6172,1.9584,1.4551,4.8846,0.673,0.3471,0.5397,1.9225,4.632,2.909,3.9125,0.3867,5.5818,1.3959,1.1201,4.0672,1.0867,2.3981,2.1214,2.1483,2.7335,0.2267,1.7925,4.0182,1.7609,1.7861,6.712,3.3685,3.8463,1.6482,1.7494,2.4966,3.4313,1.7148,1.0553,0.2917,4.5664,1.9345,4.8466,3.9711,0.0161,3.6774,9.1601,1.9707,15.0449,3.4637,1.3425,11.1449,4.0708,0.2351,0.7975,0.3784,0.9965,4.9605,1.7324,3.6911,5.7433,1.2672,3.1089,0.742,0.7539,3.342,2.4478,3.3307,5.6129,4.2576,1.0076,8.1233,4.0678,5.6922,2.2411,3.583,2.654,0.2497,0.2283,1.6961,2.2039,3.3906,1.2405,2.2711,1.3611,1.8915,1.5949,0.6321,0.2228,3.6891,4.9951,6.3806,1.4386,8.0168,1.5076,1.0824,1.2319,1.3706,0.1524,1.6209,1.3729,1.8352,2.5105,0.1775,0.0603,3.5056,2.5748,0.0278,2.9233,3.586,0.6379,2.9062,1.7759,0.8457,1.8465,0.72,3.0662,5.5192,1.066,4.5447,2.0546,0.6531,0.2897,1.0788,2.2981,3.3399,6.4742,1.5025,3.4164,4.0404,1.4318,1.6004,3.5453,1.8492,1.3632,0.4455,3.0474,1.6312,1.673,4.3541,2.6483,6.4772,0.4711,0.6639,0.7498,0.9035,0.5182,0.6823,3.7198,6.0019,0.738,5.838,0.5504,6.5154,0.0138,5.1123,0.7709,8.4897,1.3355,6.0394,1.1332,1.5642,0.9229,0.0746,0.8676,4.5018,0.7523,7.3428,1.4044,1.6535,2.3203,6.9586,6.5375,5.7385,3.4609,5.1268,2.2649,0.3547,0.7548,2.0819,3.2787,4.3004,0.0028,2.27,1.8189,4.2462,3.8997,0.0196,3.1235,1.2038,6.7424,6.182,0.2719]}

I think I have been in a better position to offer some practical suggestions on how to sell into the U.S. than most people. As I get older, I do have a slightly lower expectation of the US and, therefore, I try to keep an open mind. Not only is the U.S. a fascinating country and a leader in the world, but it also has some pretty bad habits and bad attitudes that many foreigners just can\u2019t get past.\nI used to see the U.S. as a place where everyone went to America and the American dream would happen. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as that. The U.S. has a big problem with accepting immigrants (or refugees). This has gotten worse since our President, Donald Trump appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions back in 2017. I know it is his opinion that the current laws that protect immigrants are unconstitutional. This has led to an increased number of deportations, some even in the face of the death threats received by one of their supporters. When the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported 1,018 immigrants over the weekend, it was only the fourth time that it was doing so in the past three months. With Trump\u2019s statements being unwavering, this behavior is more likely to increase.","token_len":364,"entropy":[9.1932,0.0208,9.9748,7.4471,5.3529,6.6565,2.4933,0.3955,5.4647,1.8071,0.3035,1.643,3.8157,2.9576,1.8281,1.0617,0.0302,0.1076,2.3995,4.6751,2.547,3.435,6.001,3.8276,1.2128,4.8653,1.642,4.3533,0.059,2.7334,5.3274,0.0006,3.7722,0.1957,0.0572,1.1148,5.1952,1.9515,11.1441,10.7281,2.6305,2.5967,0.6181,0.5531,20.9059,4.8308,6.9432,0.7066,4.3305,3.3443,4.4746,15.5839,5.0539,7.3526,1.9837,3.7786,6.6662,1.5017,4.348,5.6514,0.4857,1.1166,1.5272,6.3255,4.0657,5.9757,2.5967,4.9451,0.4134,1.5838,2.2624,0.0048,0.0152,0.0836,1.4404,3.6578,3.3191,0.3787,1.4424,3.7119,0.0223,0.0047,0.0358,6.6858,1.3088,0.606,5.0242,1.4253,1.3615,5.687,5.5004,0.9907,15.6137,5.3995,2.4989,2.6511,4.6786,3.9106,3.3645,2.7935,3.1666,3.3934,2.7014,5.0995,1.7166,1.6418,5.6603,3.3635,6.6204,4.2698,2.1461,0.8002,0.6436,3.9577,6.0775,0.8687,2.4377,0.003,0.0041,0.2667,2.7133,4.9474,1.3571,1.6439,4.753,1.8066,6.1197,2.5521,0.6205,0.6128,4.5409,3.2031,1.3194,6.1065,5.0334,4.7103,0.6336,2.9551,5.5632,3.8034,4.987,3.2302,0.0116,1.6888,4.7083,0.3052,2.9197,3.1158,0.586,0.0242,1.3853,6.8403,1.6373,2.3811,1.8968,2.4969,0.0009,0.0029,0.0584,2.3762,7.513,1.5817,2.5227,1.5474,6.3793,0.7642,1.284,0.4499,0.4626,0.4587,1.2926,1.6159,0.7352,2.7656,4.0741,5.1667,4.565,2.5287,3.7323,4.4204,4.0099,4.9504,4.5692,5.4158,2.0802,11.3332,6.2248,1.807,3.3733,3.3578,0.4031,1.3696,2.3203,6.2644,0.0486,4.6966,2.2369,1.5046,0.0017,0.0158,0.0514,0.6126,0.7569,3.4812,0.7361,3.6286,4.3914,0.6423,6.9808,1.4974,3.4732,3.5702,2.6365,4.6335,4.8868,0.7624,1.9779,5.3567,1.441,2.1934,1.5865,0.0264,0.9436,1.7389,3.2425,0.1882,1.0567,3.3702,4.7834,0.2187,0.3121,0.3377,2.4775,1.5302,0.0008,0.0019,0.0405,1.6025,1.2972,4.9875,1.8316,1.1156,6.9926,3.6951,5.318,3.9998,3.793,3.5562,3.8413,3.0285,4.654,1.8464,2.2539,5.1697,4.88,2.8239,2.0529,0.0873,9.2656,4.4144,0.0111,0.1097,0.0009,6.9892,0.5201,5.5779,0.6667,2.7558,4.058,2.9,2.0007,5.937,4.0697,0.7686,1.801,5.5246,5.1856,3.5484,3.2325,2.4557,1.4781,3.2821,1.1833,3.3075,2.7092,2.0156,0.3362,3.0876,3.3834,1.8297,0.0077,3.3494,0.01,1.9364,4.6901,4.1926,3.2324,1.0246,4.7532,0.0042,2.9396,6.612,1.872,5.3224,0.6771,6.5053,0.648,3.8006,4.8932,0.4987,5.3941,2.3331,5.3623,0.2616,0.653,0.0006,0.9243,0.0035,0.0251,6.4081,4.8489,0.3655,7.0868,2.8446,3.9212,0.6491,4.7115,0.3322,1.9686,1.1408,3.2281,2.2992,4.7141,0.3292,2.6734,4.0653,3.452,5.3068,0.3667,1.445,1.884,1.2076,2.5305,1.0848,0.2745,5.7984,3.0021,4.8158,0.6074,0.093,6.9121,5.4435,10.1581,1.3006,1.1442,2.9832,5.8973,1.0551,5.1364,1.8013,0.2051,4.5166,0.678]}

When asked whether the deployment was related to the American Taliban attacks at Marjah Airfield that killed five American service members and 11 Afghan civilians on Saturday, which officials were not prepared to acknowledge until a day later, Mattis said it was something that is in the \u201cdiscussion,\u201d adding \u201cwe are prepared to do whatever it takes to restore security\u201d in Afghanistan. \u201cWe are here as a partner to the Afghan government and I would say they are a lot more determined and they are doing something in the way of security cooperation and cooperation in the field that is quite remarkable,\u201d he added. When asked if the United States was considering sending its own advisers to assist the Afghan security forces against the Taliban, he said: \u201cI want to have some advisers there, but we also want to see a lot of them there also\u201d Mattis confirmed that the U.S. military is planning its own airstrikes against Taliban targets, saying the focus would primarily be on \u201csecurity and stability\u201d in Afghanistan. Trump previously denied he had decided to send troops home. His announcement came as a joint Taliban and Afghan government delegation met in Pakistan to discuss a future security agreement and Taliban demands about withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

There are many provisions that, in the absence of assurances from the administration that it is going to sign, aren\u2019t going to be signed, I can\u2019t see how the tax bill is going to be signed because we can\u2019t get into the details of the tax bill on a Friday.\u201d","token_len":364,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2192,7.2768,0.856,0.1017,2.3834,4.4607,5.0378,6.1265,5.3975,0.9034,4.5512,3.8224,10.5083,1.4943,0.5476,0.3827,4.1578,1.295,0.7116,0.0005,0.0007,10.3384,1.0063,4.3321,5.2812,1.8312,1.1684,0.0693,1.6163,13.2873,6.7165,7.4111,3.1464,4.2999,6.0828,5.228,1.4006,1.0823,3.0434,3.7662,7.716,5.1345,3.0953,2.443,0.574,1.2214,0.9008,18.8737,1.4178,4.0618,1.1992,0.6454,7.3529,5.267,1.54,1.6176,4.6914,0.9117,2.3275,2.4312,1.7205,2.7931,0.4753,5.2089,4.3157,6.2801,8.2285,3.1838,0.2961,2.6751,6.4931,5.1459,4.6388,0.3743,3.3892,1.4179,0.5469,0.1051,4.0066,2.2304,2.323,6.2876,2.2369,1.6758,3.0542,2.5137,4.1186,2.75,1.784,6.681,0.0056,4.641,3.2591,0.2053,0.5986,11.7478,1.455,2.1005,3.0823,1.5774,4.3364,5.4016,3.9619,4.038,0.8907,1.0901,1.8407,0.9647,6.2531,4.5263,1.7714,5.3459,2.0522,4.8047,14.1482,7.4855,1.0445,2.6357,5.8211,4.8394,1.9086,2.9969,1.2933,4.3558,4.0324,5.963,6.2537,3.3265,3.832,0.9866,2.1331,0.2913,1.9239,0.6016,1.15,5.4671,1.2974,1.7867,1.5989,0.026,4.3843,5.1714,1.6786,3.0706,2.3154,2.3677,5.6257,4.9949,2.4046,5.2427,0.2645,0.3276,5.46,1.4916,2.7732,1.6424,3.8523,1.0424,6.9544,5.5016,0.5424,0.0047,2.3309,5.2497,4.6913,3.1526,4.0414,4.4972,0.883,2.9692,0.0072,0.9927,8.4056,4.3944,1.8578,2.8151,1.8496,3.9391,6.5691,3.7895,7.9622,3.7821,2.4071,0.5501,1.3823,4.361,0.5757,5.9084,6.0302,7.0107,0.124,1.6195,8.4,3.3926,0.3714,1.3771,0.0379,4.5797,0.1004,1.3356,3.4206,1.0398,4.0257,6.4243,2.0196,0.5214,10.9772,1.2174,3.0337,0.8966,6.423,1.3667,4.0271,0.9023,4.7924,6.4507,1.6281,4.8074,2.7286,3.6717,5.5236,5.6664,8.4254,0.775,7.8707,0.8563,0.3245,5.2306,1.0291,4.5376,0.529,2.2975,2.5057,0.1985,0.0421,1.2047,0.149,0.0351,0.7253,0.9773,1.0015,2.6595,0.5706,3.5748,3.8261,3.8408,0.318,3.4672,0.0005,1.4993,1.7477,8.1744,2.7784,2.8761,2.2774,2.4645,2.5633,1.955,0.5935,1.4144,3.1302,6.5787,0.6069,0.106,0.0809,4.5143,1.9715,4.3637,3.9136,2.3266,6.4727,1.9158,5.3677,4.5361,1.0752,0.5283,2.7933,0.0873,4.8586,4.9312,3.0619,3.0621,1.5989,1.5992,2.3408,0.325,1.5537,1.9459,3.1555,3.9262,0.9429,2.2818,0.9898,2.0538,2.2119,4.6825,1.0753,2.3302,5.1056,1.0183,4.7381,2.4106,2.4072,4.4219,0.0013,8.4964,0.9941,0.735,1.7023,2.0457,1.5992,1.7802,0.7159,0.0078,2.7533,0.7896,6.1741,3.2578,3.2216,0.0008,1.2109,0.0038,0.6406,1.5777,2.1037,4.127,5.444,3.4429,0.6108,0.0134,2.8529,1.9293,3.3354,6.2979,1.8076,2.1499,0.0769,0.0055,0.9398,0.6631,4.0185,2.5488,3.3048,2.0694,0.0555,0.013,2.5844,3.8086,1.5796,1.7737,0.8404,2.2693,2.6839,0.8744,4.6091,2.7649,5.9989,1.516,4.9423,2.5136]}

The bill would provide more than $17.5 billion for firefighters, first responders, and recovery in areas heavily affected by the 2018 and 2019 wildfires, including California, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington state. Members of Congress have been battling for weeks in a congressional appropriations battle, and their ongoing fight has caused the recess of the House of Representatives. There is speculation that the House Republican will block the bill if it is approved by the Senate, which could mean a delay in congressional spending for people who have suffered economic hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) have told their fellow Senate Democrats to expect a floor vote on their bill as soon as Tuesday. The Senate will meet to make final votes and the vote in the chamber would only be delayed another day. The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday, but the House would have to pass it again before it could be sent to President Joe Biden for signature. In addition to the coronavirus relief bill, the Senate has been working on another round of coronavirus relief, but it has been far longer than expected. The Senate was expected to approve another round of coronavirus relief funds this week, but instead, it passed a nearly $2.5 trillion bill on Monday that included checks to households and business to help them through the crisis. The House wants a much smaller version of that bill.","token_len":365,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,6.2192,0.3207,0.021,5.1166,1.0531,0.1905,2.5939,2.2433,2.021,3.1798,2.6732,1.4067,4.0186,0.2761,10.1071,9.0562,2.7521,3.202,1.2479,7.1197,2.4367,0.3566,2.8188,2.5909,3.0128,5.5562,2.4468,0.4217,12.2371,6.7547,7.7389,5.5786,1.606,14.3414,7.6635,8.1943,1.6967,5.3119,3.411,2.6983,5.3436,8.5028,3.8078,2.238,0.3956,1.7375,0.8894,1.3209,0.0246,3.2972,1.0154,0.0023,8.9491,2.1723,6.45,1.2841,1.2519,0.3626,3.7485,1.1053,0.0104,4.1884,2.698,4.0485,0.0414,1.1032,2.4531,0.426,2.7728,2.4792,1.7377,2.0969,4.1358,0.5228,0.0539,5.2383,2.5441,1.1256,0.1554,1.9058,8.1919,1.3309,5.3483,0.0163,0.8971,1.4595,5.6951,8.1421,3.0148,7.8939,0.7197,0.0389,1.5669,8.1051,2.1867,1.7623,4.4008,1.714,3.4049,5.0527,0.6888,3.1934,0.1038,2.154,0.4068,0.1145,3.9578,2.3953,1.3465,2.2823,0.1887,7.1794,0.6279,1.2713,1.7458,1.9022,4.8384,2.3892,2.1118,4.1837,1.9816,4.8687,5.4228,1.6559,3.0896,2.071,4.8025,6.9407,2.9255,2.037,4.7686,2.9185,9.9594,5.4974,0.7103,0.4968,4.3868,0.0056,3.0438,5.4744,1.8735,6.5776,0.5162,1.193,0.9066,5.6931,6.5481,4.6735,0.6261,1.5236,2.7702,0.6447,1.9702,3.5421,1.0735,0.3041,0.4997,1.3831,1.6653,3.2584,2.8337,2.346,2.9901,0.9316,5.9948,4.6077,2.3535,8.7558,2.5371,1.8319,3.8602,5.7993,2.8484,5.6658,0.0247,1.2507,15.23,1.7514,0.3083,5.3514,0.0239,0.6841,4.6444,0.0111,5.6174,0.0052,2.9797,3.2284,0.0004,0.0001,1.2055,0.3609,5.7999,3.8665,2.0567,0.0026,3.4169,0.0007,0.0346,0.0793,0.0165,1.6582,1.4385,4.7212,4.7093,3.8946,5.6524,1.6068,2.1341,5.6312,1.5593,4.3763,0.0354,0.9488,4.2184,1.1683,3.8552,1.087,0.002,3.8538,0.5068,2.1787,2.6584,2.8283,4.59,3.6779,4.5582,1.8156,3.2923,4.4567,2.9004,5.5683,4.5639,0.6227,3.5092,2.9674,5.842,1.5514,4.8723,7.3945,1.9272,1.3457,2.0172,2.5067,4.3391,0.7607,1.8477,1.6767,2.3241,1.7938,1.8349,2.0129,0.2064,4.3539,1.548,0.177,2.6567,1.1311,3.5722,1.6741,1.174,0.6548,1.1296,2.0598,0.2701,1.9204,10.6306,0.1043,0.8306,1.7355,0.1945,3.9441,1.7889,0.9407,0.9822,11.0248,0.0004,0.0134,7.7157,1.5352,0.0855,0.9563,2.2412,2.9474,3.0584,1.6246,0.7094,3.3355,6.2613,0.0025,11.6089,0.0062,0.074,2.7016,2.8383,2.7634,2.0033,1.5179,2.0486,5.4339,6.0238,0.4227,0.5635,0.556,1.6064,2.6626,3.8666,1.4871,0.0115,3.9224,4.7764,1.4691,0.1022,1.8671,0.0009,0.0238,0.1734,7.6736,3.0029,0.3661,0.4851,0.3297,5.474,2.3861,1.651,2.6209,1.6587,7.9572,2.2963,2.7672,2.2015,1.0678,4.0849,1.0431,1.7803,2.7456,1.2843,2.9873,10.0332,1.4976,8.5877,1.9359,4.6386,4.2788,1.5852,2.0856,7.8312,0.8103,4.3169,0.1986,1.5202,1.6075,7.4385,3.4553,5.3662,2.724,4.3498,0.1534,2.4037,0.6071,1.9451]}

{"prompt":"The Kentucky county clerk who drew worldwide attention for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples two years ago will run for re-election next year , her attorney said on Tuesday . Rowan","text":"The Kentucky county clerk who drew worldwide attention for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples two years ago will run for re-election next year, her attorney said on Tuesday. Rowan County Circuit Court clerk Lisa Miller, who has made headlines for declaring marriage illegal for same-sex couples, has filed a license application ahead of Republican primaries May 15, her attorney Scott Wetstone said by fax. Miller, who worked as a law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court in 1996 and as a state appeals court lawyer, won the attention of lesbian, gay and bi-sexual rights activists after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in February 2009 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. She also filed for a job at the United States Virgin Islands, which has no civil partnership or same-sex marriage laws. In the months that followed her rejection of issuing licenses, Miller said she was not being pressured by gay activists. The federal law she clerked by, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \"does not prohibit me from marrying a man or a woman,\" she said at the time. \"It does not prohibit me from marrying someone from this sex or the other. Title VII does not provide that I am forbidden from marrying someone not from this sex or the other.\" Wetstone said last week that the race is not as close as previous elections. Miller did not file a formal candidacy, but she was endorsed by the Republican National Committee, which gave her a $1,000 political action committee donation earlier this year. Her Republican opponent was Terry Moore. Moore is the Democratic nominee for a seat on the Rowan County Board of Commissioners that Miller's office oversees. Moore said last week he will resign his commission seat if he is not re-elected.","token_len":365,"entropy":[10.3224,7.7997,1.5001,2.605,5.756,9.3696,0.3607,1.1767,1.5678,2.7591,0.0106,0.4274,0.2021,0.0209,0.3607,1.7146,0.183,7.6652,0.6407,0.0387,3.7421,5.3973,0.3726,1.9641,0.0024,0.0005,1.6135,0.1775,1.5364,3.9942,3.6326,0.6589,2.5673,1.6498,0.1266,9.3623,0.7445,0.1953,3.1707,0.7932,4.3345,5.6942,5.1037,2.3434,0.8362,1.9954,5.0185,2.2401,0.7779,6.3163,2.7631,5.296,3.7311,1.4612,0.013,0.0012,0.0404,0.697,2.7547,3.858,0.8815,9.4397,1.2585,6.4426,0.0005,6.2662,7.3284,7.1323,3.2646,2.0753,3.4003,0.7638,6.9656,9.9769,8.2661,0.3173,6.8787,7.8016,0.237,2.837,1.9844,0.9697,4.7932,1.092,0.7826,4.8636,0.0255,2.2669,0.8302,2.0766,0.0041,0.003,0.0019,1.2324,0.0017,2.2635,4.7516,1.8003,2.9418,0.5184,2.9858,4.6123,0.475,7.018,1.452,4.3142,1.9945,7.3908,0.0606,5.4071,0.6094,0.0027,1.5634,7.6682,0.6796,1.1037,2.0255,1.5133,1.9307,3.2675,0.1433,0.1674,0.5469,0.0128,0.2277,0.7073,0.0058,0.0025,0.0253,1.1426,4.017,4.4544,3.7427,2.1407,4.5902,0.0011,0.0027,0.0005,0.7607,0.0041,0.4539,3.5991,0.4941,0.011,0.0009,0.072,1.4822,2.5071,2.6345,3.064,2.834,1.3816,5.8541,2.4402,0.8637,5.1929,0.9754,4.1798,0.0049,2.018,2.0875,2.1918,3.493,4.2058,3.9356,3.9902,2.157,0.0236,0.0029,0.7228,2.0282,0.7185,3.5091,2.7521,4.4845,2.9468,0.1272,3.1411,4.2549,0.781,6.0009,1.8874,0.8041,0.8317,3.0864,0.8695,1.7296,4.5565,4.9808,3.5433,0.9336,4.6157,2.6537,2.3816,3.3432,5.842,4.7298,3.6208,7.9458,0.0014,6.7816,3.2478,5.0368,0.292,0.1958,0.0006,0.2014,0.001,0.0032,0.0986,0.0073,0.2254,5.2307,1.8563,0.0393,2.0666,7.5031,0.0889,4.7172,0.9405,3.5821,1.2756,0.4732,0.01,1.9003,0.6094,0.2996,4.8441,0.8563,0.1237,0.1957,1.2364,2.059,1.0199,0.2055,1.2439,0.1647,0.1369,1.5111,2.9159,4.3552,4.4214,6.2512,2.4242,2.1762,1.6653,3.7722,5.8182,0.0153,1.1575,0.2537,4.2235,1.6638,1.5898,2.171,4.5931,0.4875,0.8281,1.5789,6.0636,0.883,1.1263,0.0812,0.5579,0.2571,0.0137,0.3651,8.0615,0.002,0.5009,5.8517,0.8976,0.4462,2.0282,6.2303,1.8555,2.4967,4.9881,0.3866,0.103,6.1067,2.6335,1.5371,3.2725,3.7029,0.112,6.6106,1.1756,2.9528,3.5153,2.1717,0.8594,1.472,3.3426,4.5848,0.2418,1.6884,3.1222,1.2813,0.064,1.6411,1.1551,4.7546,0.4342,1.0661,1.4156,2.4348,0.5056,0.4709,7.4346,3.2496,0.0027,3.2501,4.7774,0.1424,1.1193,0.3232,4.4024,4.5402,0.3751,4.2573,6.7163,5.0443,2.5469,2.688,2.4895,2.2091,5.3288,0.6195,0.3424,3.8767,1.7107,1.4865,0.0873,9.2223,0.0029,0.0184,1.6954,0.2036,1.2651,4.4182,6.0127,4.6522,1.3098,5.3691,0.2194,2.4762,3.418,2.0841,0.2382,1.5805,2.958,6.3744,2.6182,4.3517,3.0805,1.8393,0.9563,0.7595,1.7594,0.4978,0.1167,0.0066,0.5652]}

The national prosecutor s office said","text":"Two men suspected of having fought for an al Qaeda-linked group in Syria were among four Syrian migrants arrested in the Netherlands, Dutch authorities said on Friday. The national prosecutor s office said the arrests happened last month in the northern Dutch city of Wageningen and that the men, all suspected of being in the Islamist group's ranks, were in their late teens. Investigators allege that the men, including an Algerian national and an Italian national, traveled to Syria in 2016 to join the ranks of their counterparts fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the prosecutor s office said in a statement. Four others are also in custody. Dutch authorities said in a statement Saturday that they had no details on the group's activities or aims. The group had planned to travel to Turkey to join the ranks of other jihadists in Europe and to join al Qaeda, Dutch authorities said in the statement. Two men were arrested in the Netherlands, but another two had disappeared from security checkpoints before reaching home.\nThis product has the appearance of a light bulb and has an integrated rechargeable battery that powers the lens with the simple push of the bulb.

We asked that there be special counsel,\" Mr. Trump said of the request to create a special prosecutor. \"Follow the rules, Mr. Mueller, and he will do a wonderful job.\" On Tuesday's edition of Face the Nation, a New York Times report said Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Mueller for an interview about his phone call with then-vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but Mr. Mueller had said no. \"The president has not asked me for an interview and I am surprised to hear this report,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't have any contact with the president or vice president nor are there any plans at this point.\" On Wednesday's show, CBS News' Brian Williams asked, \"Can you say for sure that Mr. Trump, on the advice of his team, has not sent for the special counsel?\" Mr. Trump's reelection campaign has defended its stance, insisting that there was no quid pro quo and that the team did not request an appointment to an investigating official. Mr. Trump aides said last month that Trump's aides had urged the special counsel to conduct a probe of his campaign's ties to Russia, alleging that there were \"serious question[s] about Russia's motive, timing and intent\" in interfering with the election.","token_len":365,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,2.2444,3.2256,2.866,2.7942,2.8792,3.3322,2.4925,2.032,2.1311,4.9202,0.0031,0.0517,0.0033,5.8819,0.9622,0.0098,0.0432,1.5024,1.4229,0.4204,2.4237,0.5248,4.8553,0.6295,0.1597,3.2478,0.5158,0.9294,0.0244,0.0485,0.1386,1.9226,0.103,0.2377,3.864,0.7355,1.3664,3.5569,3.8455,2.9845,0.7571,1.5739,8.8717,9.1365,0.8426,2.3239,0.2641,4.0455,1.0104,3.6106,0.0741,2.3324,2.5985,1.2366,5.3114,1.2471,0.0218,0.2565,0.2899,3.7175,0.0076,0.0938,1.3349,3.7536,1.2265,2.0545,0.0788,0.0,1.3587,2.2759,6.3878,2.862,4.9353,1.92,2.4962,0.8342,0.0051,11.2506,0.1878,0.3254,2.3984,0.0006,0.2356,4.0922,0.6781,0.582,7.1468,4.5865,8.5989,1.2215,2.3102,4.4822,0.9654,1.2257,4.1421,6.1433,3.5949,5.1761,3.8954,2.3595,1.2757,5.0854,4.8832,0.18,5.1641,0.0645,1.3613,0.7295,0.0003,0.0087,0.1848,3.0129,1.3433,4.8341,3.3426,8.8589,0.6683,0.0921,1.7302,0.4314,0.8339,10.6061,1.4588,2.1345,1.9176,4.156,0.0019,5.6926,1.7264,1.0711,4.2146,0.7569,1.4682,3.6079,5.3278,0.0258,0.8356,4.6471,1.9853,6.6312,2.8183,0.0038,4.0441,0.0797,0.002,0.0568,4.9251,6.3695,0.1723,0.2871,2.6685,1.2998,1.3204,0.0005,0.5398,1.347,1.2321,1.6059,0.0005,0.1655,2.3696,0.8225,0.0281,3.7291,1.5633,6.5333,2.1276,0.1794,2.1908,0.0279,7.9478,1.6205,8.3973,0.4188,0.0009,0.0002,0.75,0.8722,2.5013,2.2384,0.0004,1.8688,3.3135,3.2468,1.4563,0.6595,2.2468,2.8881,1.2627,2.1373,2.1671,1.5523,1.153,1.4187,0.1669,0.0145,3.0136,0.4851,3.3231,7.7983,3.7162,0.9179,3.3167,6.0313,0.3448,0.1925,0.0003,0.0855,0.1784,0.4769,0.713,1.0064,2.8649,0.0022,2.9329,1.7509,4.7225,0.1842,1.7169,0.2864,3.2885,4.176,0.0189,6.3215,4.8181,2.2872,0.0547,6.3218,3.77,0.5664,1.2008,2.9221,3.4069,0.8923,3.7184,1.8244,0.0552,5.1072,1.4696,1.168,3.841,0.3759,2.6019,5.6182,0.1177,4.2871,0.4984,2.5578,3.7512,0.6626,0.8925,3.0391,0.0012,0.4108,4.2813,4.3407,1.8043,4.9839,0.0322,1.2131,4.1287,0.22,1.7711,0.668,5.4481,7.8337,4.7144,1.189,0.0074,1.0689,0.5084,0.0004,0.0715,3.4102,13.5526,0.0775,3.2668,5.4337,2.1928,5.3956,1.4037,3.8612,0.6825,3.4653,1.1077,0.5404,5.9675,0.0212,0.0018,0.0002,3.2144,0.3745,1.765,6.2282,3.511,0.151,4.0057,0.8273,8.4977,2.974,3.5052,5.0296,4.1546,0.3775,2.5554,0.0008,0.4018,7.29,1.8915,5.0929,1.6389,0.2225,5.566,2.1849,3.6828,1.2726,6.0953,1.9021,1.6979,0.0146,0.4336,3.6332,1.3258,2.578,1.7621,2.5362,0.7446,1.6187,0.8824,0.066,0.1276,1.2762,6.742,0.6764,4.1731,1.8198,1.7055,3.6518,7.7793,10.1024,0.0476,0.0799,1.3831,4.3796,0.5459,6.8058,3.4221,5.8944,0.8323,2.3481,1.8832,1.5547,5.7553,1.7079,0.0736,0.7107,0.1985]}

Currently lawmakers must buy health insurance or be fined.\nThose on the fence said the tax law does not provide much explanation as to how a repeal of the mandate will benefit them.\n\"I think the fact that it's not explained clearly enough so everyone who thinks it's something they support, who needs it, who is a good customer of somebody, has the same level of protection whether or not they've taken this step to sign up for this,\" said Carol McCracken, of the Texas Health & Policy Foundation.\n\"It appears that Republicans are going down a path to privatize health care,\" said Tom Kroll, a spokesperson for the conservative think tank Free Enterprise Society.\nFor people like McCracken, a registered Democrat, Republicans seem to be setting a precedent on government spending that is not only unconstitutional but also unsustainable for the country.\n\"The idea that you can cut programs that help the poor and retirees and middle-class families while on the same time continuing to spend and spend and spend and spend - the idea of that is crazy,\" said McCracken, who has been a government policy analyst with the Center for Economic and Policy Research.","token_len":366,"entropy":[6.2396,8.1838,3.8535,9.0428,2.0296,0.6908,5.7051,0.487,0.0456,0.103,5.3219,0.3723,0.3862,2.6888,2.0183,4.1995,2.3144,3.9744,5.9654,1.5311,0.4012,0.2209,5.9721,5.8175,5.292,2.7822,1.7531,1.1161,4.7264,0.461,0.0145,6.2226,6.744,1.8571,4.0224,1.1833,0.7389,1.3387,8.6716,9.4263,0.2377,0.509,14.9879,3.7357,1.8681,1.3062,1.7551,2.6643,1.9464,2.2221,0.4904,2.7573,3.4082,0.5033,2.6298,1.0295,7.2762,0.8989,1.1746,1.5782,1.4294,1.5355,0.8663,1.4901,2.5693,4.476,3.54,8.6385,4.8636,4.2868,1.1905,7.4928,0.0413,6.4506,2.2768,2.821,4.8147,2.179,4.1588,2.2316,3.1671,1.2697,5.9985,2.1465,5.1645,1.216,0.7364,2.4008,3.9131,0.1413,1.3706,5.4509,4.2681,0.0104,5.1081,0.3881,0.9517,2.5025,3.0591,3.1371,11.5176,0.7503,0.402,0.2797,4.502,4.5617,6.8372,0.093,3.7107,3.4435,0.4394,0.7426,0.0356,1.8216,1.9032,0.7295,1.381,0.0115,0.107,0.0033,2.082,6.2713,0.1718,0.0425,0.8313,5.4995,1.2757,2.666,0.124,3.866,6.1694,7.8134,2.7159,4.9644,1.2498,0.1083,4.3889,5.0486,4.3016,2.4667,0.403,5.1604,4.3006,0.6337,5.3566,5.6949,1.3929,2.9808,6.5315,3.8411,0.4308,2.941,2.7268,9.188,2.4372,0.0389,1.0774,4.1278,5.2178,1.2307,0.3556,2.4152,2.8806,4.0142,2.6463,0.9527,0.4652,0.509,1.8315,1.4616,1.9136,4.5985,0.3066,1.6164,0.8374,2.4924,5.5039,3.3308,1.9861,6.09,5.3134,3.7934,3.3811,1.0214,0.3267,3.9247,1.8745,6.1844,2.512,2.8162,5.6954,1.3017,0.7841,2.3836,2.2693,3.7375,4.3825,3.845,2.487,7.6387,3.5817,3.898,4.0734,3.5436,4.774,0.023,5.9214,7.1413,3.4708,0.0005,0.5482,3.872,5.2605,4.5951,3.2899,3.4479,6.4088,0.5196,0.4955,4.2257,2.598,0.1364,6.6155,5.92,4.5759,0.0044,0.0994,4.8197,0.8707,7.3135,2.4812,4.7351,6.2356,6.2169,0.3666,0.3374,3.6907,1.914,5.8217,1.7697,3.4299,0.7378,2.2023,5.348,1.2661,1.241,2.7299,6.0512,1.4615,1.5476,0.4095,2.3751,1.3119,4.4574,5.0752,4.7708,0.1454,1.5265,6.7196,0.026,0.615,3.2359,4.0321,0.0231,7.7161,2.053,7.0748,0.2102,0.5034,5.3974,5.2617,2.8472,1.5275,0.0084,0.0003,0.3458,3.6492,6.8942,1.1192,0.8874,6.7067,3.7784,0.6118,0.8993,6.4591,2.4149,2.4271,4.9108,4.5532,1.4066,2.2277,2.0443,2.316,3.5192,4.3182,0.7534,1.3586,4.3218,3.0721,0.9695,1.8938,0.4414,0.2356,0.4013,2.3917,2.8175,0.3698,2.5196,0.9242,2.6528,4.743,1.4594,1.7229,1.4711,0.8982,0.867,4.7886,1.6847,5.0328,0.9545,0.1279,1.7636,4.8646,6.3769,0.8781,3.1023,5.568,6.3715,0.2732,2.9688,4.8366,2.3904,2.4183,0.3131,1.2673,0.2843,6.9281,3.6859,1.2312,2.2394,4.2866,1.7229,5.2899,0.2754,1.4523,0.257,0.0032,0.0005,0.5118,0.7188,2.3721,1.5712,1.3748,5.7421,3.456,0.831,3.894,0.2182,2.4408,0.1508,3.3071,0.2814,0.0014,0.01,1.1605]}

The Senate had yet to meet on the issue.\nThe $500 billion spending bill could fund the government through Sept. 30. It includes money for a military buildup, foreign aid, military operations and border security.\nThe House of Representatives has not yet taken up a bill that would extend government funding through Dec. 14, or until a next election takes place.\nPresident Trump, who has threatened more aggressive efforts at shutting down the government, said on Twitter last week that he will veto if Congress fails to pass the $740 billion legislation.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not expected to support the measure, a spokesman said on Tuesday. If the two sides do not come to an agreement on a short-term measure by May 28, it is up to the president to veto it.\nThe federal government is currently due for a $900 billion budget cut, as the White House and the Congress have failed to agree since December on the level of money needed to fund the Pentagon and other government agencies.","token_len":367,"entropy":[3.6707,1.4879,4.1883,0.0016,0.0422,0.1786,1.2852,0.6823,0.0027,4.7525,4.3782,6.8168,2.3433,2.6598,1.3853,2.8192,5.8622,2.0521,7.592,0.9256,3.2922,0.483,3.3187,1.7242,5.2745,1.6156,0.0327,4.0754,3.9427,6.595,0.1813,3.0562,2.1503,0.7527,0.0603,5.5616,1.0537,0.0168,3.6599,2.206,4.1547,1.5269,4.951,0.0529,4.7452,3.3511,1.326,1.5608,0.1564,24.0438,3.1576,0.1113,10.0978,0.001,0.0001,0.0145,0.6864,0.0518,0.0532,0.2634,0.0004,0.1937,5.1547,4.7303,4.0697,3.3321,0.0583,1.0571,3.5571,0.7259,2.7014,2.4696,3.1585,0.1972,3.285,5.6166,4.6069,1.1122,0.547,0.0037,3.8153,1.7853,4.8093,0.0043,3.7301,1.5728,2.6331,2.087,2.5385,4.4809,0.9706,5.1455,1.1197,4.1409,3.8669,2.4951,0.0035,0.0864,4.3605,0.1569,2.8006,5.1312,5.3777,1.3806,5.8733,2.2748,0.0117,0.6241,0.576,0.2436,23.8418,1.1428,0.0039,0.0572,4.5554,2.738,6.269,3.0998,4.565,0.5501,0.1282,0.1802,3.7245,0.0003,1.5077,0.0087,0.0002,10.5142,7.3866,3.9942,2.1517,1.2128,0.1567,3.1712,0.7757,3.2898,1.8687,0.5987,0.9125,1.5,4.2841,1.6183,2.014,2.9103,3.6283,0.8626,5.2409,3.7153,0.4991,1.6293,0.4245,0.0344,0.0385,1.6874,0.2179,22.3162,2.6964,3.5537,3.2321,1.9929,0.2769,0.5122,0.0356,0.624,4.1168,3.9889,4.0404,4.6652,0.005,4.014,2.1968,2.118,1.1621,0.7212,0.1314,13.6063,5.9079,4.1856,0.2744,2.8542,1.0281,4.5047,6.1783,1.1468,0.5773,0.9955,2.5252,0.0027,0.0882,1.6118,2.433,4.0707,4.8341,0.7061,2.6113,5.6808,3.8054,1.9378,6.5118,0.2625,1.1617,4.2344,4.2345,0.8811,4.8092,0.2036,0.7462,0.773,7.9694,2.2127,4.5441,0.0127,1.7946,2.2291,1.207,3.7543,0.4526,2.2191,2.6504,1.6492,0.3517,2.2108,4.1734,0.5235,2.5439,3.9343,0.0016,4.6764,1.0426,4.698,3.1394,2.9471,5.9188,3.4468,8.0811,0.0258,0.4911,0.6336,7.171,0.9881,2.9805,0.7791,1.0887,3.2096,6.0195,5.1734,5.8092,2.4021,4.128,0.0987,0.3101,0.2232,0.8652,2.3189,1.6786,2.1525,3.5895,0.2641,0.2866,0.9807,3.6966,2.741,6.9938,1.5861,1.5824,0.0286,1.1071,1.3067,3.3193,12.92,0.0131,5.3108,0.9164,0.4371,7.5016,0.8346,0.0246,0.0266,0.0003,5.7686,3.9968,0.6431,0.0196,3.4694,0.6336,2.0511,1.0932,3.9501,2.3162,0.6391,1.9886,1.11,0.3452,5.3588,1.5955,5.2573,1.2523,1.8295,0.5571,4.1379,0.1533,0.9253,0.0228,1.2054,0.8921,3.7541,0.0241,0.0022,2.5668,2.7878,5.3006,4.0862,0.0693,2.6278,3.0152,3.9285,0.0261,0.5166,1.9248,0.2928,2.6136,0.9267,0.5495,0.2436,4.5527,5.4103,0.1518,1.7049,3.332,5.4726,4.3533,0.9496,1.6511,5.3273,0.03,1.6596,2.1419,2.2098,4.3547,2.4298,2.2683,0.001,2.3266,2.2773,5.2192,2.8819,4.4845,0.0334,0.9458,11.0355,3.998,1.3775,2.6172,6.4491,0.1724,5.696,2.1884,0.314,3.109,0.4639,5.1658,1.1054,0.9268,1.8758,0.5768,0.3661]}

The U.S. said Saturday that the Russians must deliver on their undertaking to pull all of their forces from the Syrian region. \u201cWe were clear with the Russian government and the government of Syria, that this is a matter of the U.S. and Russian leaders reaching an agreement that this will be done. Now it\u2019s a matter of Russia demonstrating that it has delivered on that,\u201d Assistant Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.\nI don\u2019t know why we have to constantly worry about Russia. At least there\u2019s no other country using our soldiers in combat. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of American soldiers being trained in Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s much closer to home and therefore much closer to national security.\nThe U.S. has warned Russia since the start of the war last year that its efforts to win this fight would harm the U.S. and other Western allies. That is exactly what Russia has done, according to U.S. officials.

The legislation calls on the U.S. Congress to consider restricting access to ammunition, including bump stocks.\n\u201cThe gun control proposals that we\u2019ve seen in this year\u2019s Congressional elections, which were aimed at limiting access to assault weapons and long-barreled rifles, didn\u2019t address the safety of the people who already own these weapons, \u201d said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from West Virginia and a staunch opponent of the legislation. \u201c This latest proposal would have gone further to address public-safety concerns. It would have required manufacturers to label weapons that have this feature, and require that new weapons come with warnings about the dangers of bumping and to be fitted with accessories that do not allow the weapon to be fired multiple times. \u201c\nThe proposal would have required gun manufacturers to label any weapons with a feature that allows the weapon to be fired multiple times. These could be bumpers or any other devices designed to stop a firing weapon from repeating a fire. The bill also would have prohibited the sale and transfer of bump stocks by law enforcement agencies and private gun owners.","token_len":368,"entropy":[7.2935,0.4147,1.6582,6.2954,2.1742,0.5759,3.7493,0.0003,0.0029,0.238,1.0986,0.7893,0.0027,4.2968,2.5672,2.0453,0.5086,0.9555,4.7781,4.4538,2.3327,3.4009,5.2693,0.3532,6.601,1.1604,5.0686,0.0456,14.4113,8.0636,11.2569,5.2845,3.3934,6.5424,8.5551,6.2831,4.2928,6.3649,6.5667,0.3411,2.765,5.0509,0.457,1.4694,5.0469,1.3316,0.0001,0.0,0.5503,0.2555,15.2857,3.8538,6.6112,4.0488,0.3977,1.4034,3.5712,0.0005,0.004,0.0023,2.8221,2.2432,4.1097,2.768,4.0173,5.4106,2.5154,1.7051,3.373,1.9273,2.9822,4.5277,0.8213,8.1211,0.0086,0.0004,5.9327,0.4722,0.1453,1.2563,3.6782,0.0686,6.1043,1.7614,4.3188,0.0365,1.4075,2.8281,2.5526,6.2857,1.949,1.0396,1.537,4.5158,0.0167,3.2727,3.5114,0.094,2.9347,1.8576,0.6148,0.1757,6.9153,2.8745,0.5577,0.889,3.1711,5.1766,0.0111,0.2069,10.3399,8.6189,3.5213,5.3273,0.502,8.5363,0.2439,0.0009,13.1087,4.5842,0.0011,0.965,0.3705,0.9116,0.1805,5.7724,0.0137,9.6322,3.514,3.2256,6.5103,0.2659,0.8479,1.7752,2.7037,2.2484,2.5952,3.1072,0.6951,2.6648,2.7157,5.9996,2.7441,0.8975,2.047,0.0003,0.0027,0.0016,1.8839,0.0593,3.8244,6.0737,2.4584,0.0527,6.0534,3.2204,2.4543,0.1702,0.2397,1.8049,0.4993,3.7431,1.554,5.3952,4.7337,2.0432,4.7235,3.3882,5.7885,12.5987,10.5014,4.8362,1.7478,1.4296,2.7188,4.0567,1.3665,1.6155,5.6858,5.1642,5.3179,2.867,3.0541,3.242,5.9026,0.0565,2.8786,0.6881,0.075,1.2783,1.3931,1.782,6.4497,1.1166,2.7874,0.0469,0.0094,1.1206,0.3649,6.3034,0.2347,2.5376,0.0798,3.9751,0.9616,3.1389,2.7711,2.7531,6.0777,1.0299,5.2261,0.6619,2.6406,1.2425,1.5749,4.6713,4.3954,1.8242,2.9344,5.4798,6.6504,0.8813,0.0021,0.2082,2.901,2.3563,0.3033,4.1787,0.2804,2.7748,1.2669,4.7461,2.4539,0.0314,1.6344,2.4604,0.1669,3.3116,0.5817,8.342,6.1379,3.7137,2.7696,3.3739,6.6188,1.8596,2.4666,3.894,7.0057,6.359,0.4112,0.195,2.2857,2.932,0.9792,0.7738,2.7286,3.0704,0.421,5.8821,4.6588,1.9268,2.7565,7.9575,1.7417,2.2975,1.7168,3.9818,2.6335,5.5782,3.8591,3.8301,0.3034,5.148,2.1753,1.5349,3.3531,0.6544,0.2206,3.3298,2.9057,6.1583,5.0084,4.979,0.0304,5.3622,0.9571,4.3768,0.5233,3.703,1.939,3.5975,0.1091,2.5498,1.7169,2.2516,0.5596,0.6335,2.7385,0.0951,2.362,2.1502,3.0885,1.6587,1.0071,1.69,3.592,0.9068,0.1246,3.3946,4.1316,3.4331,2.135,2.55,2.1471,0.677,1.6492,1.0376,1.3316,0.0353,0.692,0.1367,0.1737,0.0156,1.2721,5.3023,4.3405,2.2869,2.0121,2.7207,2.1104,5.3127,0.558,4.6642,3.6853,0.1936,4.4538,1.9642,5.1132,2.8007,2.0297,5.8022,3.4018,4.5091,1.1323,2.1771,2.4888,1.7472,0.615,0.1913,2.8,1.4102,2.0761,2.5884,2.6891,0.0361,0.7014,3.5495,4.0613,3.0628,0.9819,0.8948,2.5917,4.2432,2.7598,1.8969,0.6606]}

The 2018 law did not specifically address tax breaks for religious organizations, leaving this up to executive discretion at the IRS.\n\"I think we get the answer that we're looking for,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said on Thursday during a briefing that highlighted the new proposal. \"But there's not much in the IRS code so far as the ability to change the tax treatment of those religious entities who do have the option of paying more to provide assistance to others.\"\nThe proposal -- unveiled by the White House Office of Management and Budget, but not the IRS -- came as Trump urged people to work together to enact a tax reform plan that would end \"excessive\" taxes, bring the United States tax burden in line with other high-income countries and make the country fairer and more competitive again -- including in areas like corporate tax rates and small business ownership restrictions.","token_len":369,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,10.4808,7.1306,4.5824,1.126,3.5618,0.1205,4.283,0.0586,4.5322,0.907,2.5861,2.5475,5.7243,0.0638,4.2925,0.9979,1.785,0.4245,0.0052,0.0018,2.8802,2.8123,5.3304,3.1299,1.3242,4.0054,0.3767,0.5053,0.0277,8.614,2.5735,1.8733,3.1225,2.6207,1.9483,0.4618,0.9793,4.6785,3.7896,3.0504,0.0274,0.01,6.1357,2.4624,1.7635,3.1803,4.4587,0.1667,6.2353,4.683,0.0003,0.0045,0.0711,5.9864,0.5464,0.124,14.9991,5.9799,2.8001,0.0097,0.0138,0.0003,0.0065,0.9832,4.855,0.5367,1.1043,0.886,3.6464,7.0403,2.4851,7.399,0.0337,0.6973,4.502,4.8896,4.7094,3.9011,1.7432,0.6799,5.9393,1.0749,4.0898,2.5771,1.9622,3.2347,6.1114,3.51,3.6557,0.4288,1.8169,6.0675,6.3013,1.2155,5.1457,0.0039,4.9184,0.0002,0.0013,0.0062,3.069,1.4662,1.3491,2.3847,2.0294,3.6808,0.8409,0.3165,0.4144,2.2772,4.5768,5.2282,0.1049,3.8075,5.2909,3.0965,4.0845,1.998,4.2541,2.0337,10.7835,0.0001,4.8573,0.7434,1.0758,0.0003,0.0022,0.1015,2.969,1.9666,1.8471,5.3982,0.6252,7.284,0.2248,3.2669,1.0314,4.0154,1.3314,3.6947,2.3746,4.8779,6.4545,1.1876,1.8261,3.1713,0.8813,0.4525,1.9154,8.623,4.8196,0.2688,0.0004,0.035,0.0012,0.018,8.9192,5.3585,2.4761,2.4579,0.5509,4.0344,0.3312,1.3905,4.9842,5.9607,1.3269,3.965,4.7047,7.6483,4.6906,3.2672,7.3899,1.2309,0.0035,3.6886,7.5513,0.0631,5.461,4.7932,2.7063,1.3081,6.1187,1.8163,1.9697,1.0987,2.4514,5.1552,2.6362,4.2772,0.2204,4.07,2.8485,3.4031,2.2791,0.2767,1.2228,1.2694,1.0345,6.0408,6.325,4.9783,0.0368,7.0189,5.6702,5.7418,0.3749,1.0541,0.3471,0.1498,2.0212,2.8396,1.087,2.8074,6.546,2.7059,5.2899,2.9695,1.9675,2.6712,2.7801,0.2984,1.0765,3.8994,0.001,2.7345,2.6667,0.0013,0.0004,0.7327,0.3013,0.0351,3.4674,0.6177,0.5703,2.6378,1.9872,3.0481,0.3217,4.5341,5.4538,6.3456,0.7512,3.8638,4.4996,0.5596,0.8793,3.2336,3.0877,0.9483,3.7629,2.0125,3.5822,0.6084,6.0186,3.701,5.7432,2.6163,4.6262,3.356,3.3671,0.2477,4.5241,1.2955,0.9541,3.9326,0.3276,3.5784,4.0307,1.4172,6.2225,3.7769,3.9626,3.591,4.6155,1.4416,2.943,4.2661,3.5232,5.7949,4.8623,0.8797,4.0329,1.1909,0.0468,1.4856,3.2783,8.5298,4.9523,1.3581,2.8464,2.8165,0.0006,4.8629,0.0224,0.144,0.005,0.0,3.0019,4.2016,1.3386,3.3365,2.164,1.4101,4.9397,1.6235,1.4417,6.5329,5.661,0.515,4.4628,3.3038,0.5281,4.8053,1.4774,1.7849,1.3046,1.673,1.1444,0.672,4.4116,3.1788,7.9729,0.7397,1.6083,3.536,3.2299,6.0013,2.6884,5.2602,0.002,5.2988,1.0038,5.8759,0.0197,0.0085,1.1423,6.7092,0.0652,0.6068,0.7009,0.5931,3.3672,1.6339,3.1777,3.7576,0.0005,3.3073,0.5368,1.2973,6.7702,6.301,3.754,2.4673,3.6487,1.2654,4.9537,1.5042,1.25,1.5931,6.5963,0.26,4.8175,6.4075,0.1388]}

But it is only better than none.\u201d The Treasury Department said it was reviewing the proposal. \u201c We do not have an opportunity to review it until after it has been proposed to Congress. By that time, we can also make sure that it is consistent \u2026 with the Treasury Department\u2019s policies on fair treatment of businesses,\u201d said a statement from the Treasury.\nPresident Trump has been talking a lot about getting a big deficit reduction \u2013 which he said would be $ 1 trillion and it would be done by reducing taxes on people who make less than $ 130 million and on corporations. In his recent interview, he made a speech to raise taxes on those on the richest. If a significant number of the corporate tax rates are lowered and no taxes on those on the top incomes are raised, that would be what Trump was trying to say. He also said on last year that he was not going to give an extra $ 30 billion on the corporate income tax. But he has yet to give.\nIn the current proposals, corporate rates seem to have a floor with no ceiling which is good \u2013 because that is not what was there. I have long argued that the real rate needs to be a floor and a ceiling with the top rate in excess of 30 percent. That is how the U.S. tax rate operates today and that is what works best for corporate income taxpayers. Taxpayers on the top end are more likely to pay the tax based on the actual operating income of the company and not take advantage of the deductions allowed, while those on lower levels of income tend to take advantage of the tax breaks or credits.","token_len":370,"entropy":[7.2138,0.1791,2.2959,2.4778,1.8189,1.3822,1.4835,7.2572,0.4067,4.8749,1.8964,8.7942,7.2491,4.7818,2.4248,2.3029,6.3201,0.7643,3.0563,6.9188,1.5201,5.6499,0.4056,0.0001,0.5503,14.7583,6.5858,10.8244,0.0093,7.3468,14.9442,2.314,6.0232,5.3648,0.2036,4.0011,3.6403,9.3179,1.0506,5.424,4.1003,2.1506,2.2051,4.0483,7.0625,0.171,8.1088,0.8669,4.0629,6.4577,2.5205,5.7996,0.3522,1.9956,1.3492,2.2986,3.4516,1.2758,2.9195,2.1283,3.8425,0.9774,5.184,4.6102,0.424,1.6509,2.9006,4.5089,0.2432,2.443,1.9257,2.5508,1.9349,2.4079,2.016,0.1235,4.7881,2.5436,1.08,0.923,7.4437,1.8737,0.2637,0.295,0.7189,3.8917,5.0251,3.7249,3.7565,0.9516,1.5198,0.6918,4.2785,10.7053,0.713,0.9471,3.7762,0.5728,10.7905,7.3541,4.6381,5.1015,2.1723,5.9977,2.7532,0.6773,4.5144,2.0688,6.7164,3.6,4.677,3.5644,3.4754,0.9714,0.8305,0.8047,3.3457,1.1674,10.8461,0.9359,2.287,2.3929,4.0302,4.0879,0.3468,0.3152,4.6703,2.6416,4.5438,7.8343,0.2368,7.6659,3.3789,1.6511,2.2001,1.924,1.0444,5.0498,9.1148,0.8737,3.8226,5.1812,0.662,0.8416,2.3164,1.1926,5.076,1.919,0.8097,3.4722,2.6756,1.3385,0.8915,0.0479,0.0875,8.207,3.4785,3.7574,2.5569,3.4408,2.2967,3.938,2.1664,4.2176,3.3035,2.2123,1.2234,3.9694,2.0015,5.4309,2.406,5.3367,1.5783,0.2935,3.2774,5.1755,0.6905,3.7073,5.7304,5.1176,4.4249,5.4355,2.2364,0.0713,2.5753,5.6131,0.6874,2.3699,1.0929,1.8167,3.5429,5.5141,5.6762,3.3127,2.344,1.543,0.135,2.1604,8.2723,0.5191,0.7376,0.268,2.2042,0.7148,1.5049,5.0904,3.0264,3.7958,3.1855,0.0063,2.5206,0.5231,3.0309,2.4363,0.9507,4.8785,6.9237,1.4535,4.2314,1.0749,2.3614,2.7819,1.3584,0.0209,4.9285,4.3045,5.674,1.8162,4.6915,0.4923,4.4706,1.6012,3.3368,2.9917,0.0403,2.1936,2.9831,1.7304,2.2511,5.0041,0.0046,2.0523,5.7213,1.2366,3.9064,1.8635,4.8626,6.462,0.6612,4.303,1.6494,7.4558,0.2292,2.5855,3.3976,8.557,5.2916,3.6014,2.8591,6.4234,1.3161,4.779,4.8789,3.0073,3.8184,1.2806,3.5593,1.7133,4.6291,4.6506,1.5404,4.4153,2.9332,5.7776,2.8438,0.2726,1.5924,4.7852,4.6562,5.1731,0.0899,0.1659,4.0216,3.4377,2.8906,2.7586,1.6696,2.6241,3.7023,3.7891,1.2351,3.7723,4.9377,0.0289,3.427,0.3812,0.7612,2.3564,0.7508,3.906,1.5136,4.8909,0.0056,0.004,0.0144,2.2284,5.5867,5.3479,2.1897,2.8237,2.3215,0.361,1.4758,7.0807,2.9006,0.949,4.1865,2.4817,6.6574,0.34,5.4526,2.0905,4.3453,0.3837,0.8112,2.568,2.3898,3.869,0.7225,0.0443,0.9819,1.9209,2.5626,7.3697,0.0256,1.5302,4.0904,7.3118,1.5773,0.9574,1.0512,1.3055,2.4489,1.9617,7.675,1.7362,0.0302,1.1914,3.2927,6.2462,4.9566,4.1893,1.8527,0.318,5.5494,4.5444,2.3917,0.7235,4.6714,0.0528,3.1371,0.1009,0.0739,0.8086,2.6471,1.772,5.8018,4.1301,1.4212]}

He said he would propose that Iran be able to circumvent such a verification system if they want to sell nuclear-enriched uranium.\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump said he \"will be doing a deal\" for Iran that his top national security adviser John Bolton proposed.","token_len":371,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,4.4868,1.8199,7.0586,0.3299,7.0949,2.8193,5.2213,1.4852,2.6716,0.1181,0.6221,6.5009,0.1377,0.196,7.8202,0.0019,3.3647,3.7444,0.0037,3.1602,2.9861,1.9111,1.7447,4.9887,3.7489,1.5029,0.1787,0.1518,0.7502,4.1764,1.5695,6.2261,0.0169,7.7939,4.0531,0.1004,0.0083,5.399,1.998,1.4252,0.464,2.0151,3.2082,4.1598,2.2591,1.1796,0.1017,0.2009,0.0509,0.0,0.1275,0.2439,24.6879,0.0001,4.1709,4.1467,0.0106,6.0033,2.8312,6.6347,0.6132,0.0955,3.0627,4.0599,1.8269,1.6816,2.2021,2.8923,1.5706,0.929,0.5892,0.7595,2.4471,4.8659,2.8219,0.24,0.4012,1.8059,0.8064,0.0283,0.0057,0.9077,4.5206,0.7394,3.8879,1.5576,2.2003,4.585,0.0703,4.5863,2.1689,2.2088,8.2359,2.8391,2.411,2.5761,3.2515,0.0323,2.3698,4.295,0.1867,3.8952,4.1428,4.4733,3.5425,6.3266,1.8118,0.7543,0.1738,6.7117,3.7515,0.0004,4.0126,0.0446,7.4434,1.3795,2.221,4.5391,0.925,0.7679,5.5463,1.5796,5.4535,3.6711,5.2969,1.8624,6.564,0.8073,2.659,5.7558,7.8352,1.0111,0.4295,2.294,1.5647,2.8249,5.9117,2.6926,1.3121,3.4426,3.2463,1.9516,1.2294,2.568,0.2318,0.3836,0.6108,2.8168,3.0931,2.7138,1.7525,6.5671,1.8005,0.8765,2.5258,2.6119,0.3874,4.643,5.3364,2.2469,1.2644,1.4047,0.8128,6.1611,1.5268,1.0132,2.1691,3.428,0.8426,3.6029,0.0038,6.7062,0.2414,1.3944,3.5005,4.2609,0.5941,0.4356,2.801,1.8862,1.2999,3.1144,1.4879,4.8431,3.8388,3.6638,5.6304,2.7507,3.3553,2.2362,2.6871,3.7821,0.0189,4.0972,0.7529,0.1595,6.6829,5.8907,0.6676,2.9628,1.9633,1.1811,4.1956,0.3112,2.5728,1.4073,0.2787,5.1133,2.4043,2.3918,5.0153,1.216,5.8117,3.2855,0.8727,5.5342,1.5456,7.3497,5.9282,0.8383,0.8118,0.8232,0.2555,4.6385,1.6033,3.5802,7.469,0.8734,4.9588,1.5285,1.2755,1.1361,0.0006,0.0122,0.0423,1.9309,4.5003,2.6107,4.8236,6.0897,0.1872,0.1404,0.4407,2.9624,0.596,0.1993,0.4157,0.1342,0.5537,2.6134,6.5844,2.6081,8.8685,8.2712,3.0527,1.9743,4.3143,1.2348,5.0983,1.762,4.1566,0.2332,3.8436,2.13,0.3565,3.262,1.6649,2.6818,2.2284,3.0496,6.1463,0.1696,3.8347,1.8429,3.5833,1.9944,1.5878,0.2259,0.1524,0.176,0.2971,2.0061,0.0014,1.4847,1.3357,5.2095,3.6976,1.5745,3.337,2.92,0.2408,3.1269,2.8018,1.8622,4.7862,1.031,5.1213,1.6881,0.034,0.1203,2.2455,0.8962,1.8545,3.8925,0.2737,1.5284,0.9284,1.9067,1.0399,4.5543,0.8181,4.0963,0.3258,2.3618,0.8933,2.667,0.8656,1.526,1.5763,6.0953,2.4582,2.063,3.1126,2.4605,0.0263,7.0802,3.7584,0.4845,6.0815,3.0435,2.4747,2.7823,3.0849,0.2592,5.272,3.2419,2.6176,7.8664,0.6599,0.1518,2.7416,0.2002,6.6374,2.4764,1.1282,0.0569,1.9734,2.0807,0.781,4.2357,2.3357,1.9621,4.894,1.9075,3.0847,1.7264,4.0236,1.0025,2.1147,6.1454,4.619,2.237,0.0082,0.4843,6.9277,2.1372,6.4411,2.3791]}

It is unclear how aggressive the China may be in getting the results the United States expects. Beijing, which says its trade with North Korea is profitable, has not threatened a freeze on trade flows even as it has imposed some pressure on Pyongyang to take tougher action against the United States and other Western powers.\nDuring the Trump campaign in 2016, Trump told supporters he wanted a stronger relationship with China \u2014 although the U.S. President was not comfortable with some of the actions that China had taken to shore up its currency \u2014 and that the U.S. would not sign a trade deal with China without pressure on Beijing for respect of human rights.

The Senate leader's effort was unlikely to win bipartisan support.\nThe impasse has shut down government spending for the nation's third day.\nRepublican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said that he would agree to an agreement that would give the U.S. government another three months to come up with a new fiscal deal.\nBut that seemed unlikely to do much to halt the impasse and he would not be the Senate's leader immediately if the issue led to a breakup of the chamber.\nPresident Barack Obama is expected to meet congressional leaders on Friday.\nThe impasse is a dramatic departure from the congressional style of negotiations in the days leading up to a Christmas recess in 2011 that led to a fiscal deal that put the nation on track for deficit reduction.\n\"Every single day brings an even greater risk to a deficit crisis that we've already experienced,\" said Representative Charlie Dent, a Missouri Republican.\nThe bill would have paid for about $529 million per week if enacted. That would have left the government with about $120 billion in reserves before the end of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.\nSome of that would have been money that the lawmakers could have spent in the current fiscal year and had not otherwise been available.","token_len":374,"entropy":[9.3057,7.2628,1.7354,3.9028,0.908,3.5097,0.0009,0.0031,0.1037,1.2463,7.6898,2.656,2.9093,2.0371,8.4797,6.2074,3.7363,1.7004,1.0746,4.087,3.7977,0.1223,6.6855,5.7787,3.0373,2.1014,9.1979,5.7906,6.5499,0.1627,3.5726,4.6355,5.8122,1.0708,2.6916,5.0117,2.4732,4.7771,2.1858,5.4559,0.0002,0.3519,0.1845,25.471,1.0773,0.0264,0.294,0.0003,3.8204,0.0791,1.9418,3.3619,3.0427,1.1985,4.8396,3.4717,3.3738,2.7193,0.0044,6.8567,3.7672,2.4756,5.1406,3.1899,3.2038,0.9524,2.01,0.3472,4.7449,4.8934,2.6518,5.2945,5.5109,2.6944,3.3591,1.4127,2.7816,0.2823,2.926,2.7602,7.4725,5.8451,0.2424,1.541,5.5415,2.9146,1.7299,7.0448,3.1868,0.7851,0.3,21.8371,0.0001,6.0496,2.2261,2.1314,2.8225,3.353,1.7253,1.6435,3.1513,2.1406,6.0507,0.4685,0.1096,1.652,0.4496,8.6893,4.9916,7.8637,3.2836,0.2148,5.839,5.6759,0.6863,2.4986,2.7668,5.8199,0.8877,3.4452,1.6881,2.8801,2.3566,5.8898,2.5787,5.9217,2.5894,6.4408,0.1032,3.3695,3.9549,0.1724,1.2764,0.3276,2.083,6.7663,0.0002,2.3231,7.224,0.3912,3.5787,3.3357,1.4839,1.4805,6.9708,0.063,2.0802,6.1954,2.281,0.7224,3.7569,4.2327,5.9987,0.0016,0.0002,0.184,0.2991,1.0586,2.2151,2.1276,1.6324,6.816,0.3049,2.2755,5.5707,2.901,0.7055,3.5605,0.9205,3.274,0.0005,0.004,0.002,0.9921,3.9544,3.8239,1.8717,0.2612,4.1,0.1313,0.0018,0.6826,1.6702,3.474,2.4859,0.8212,0.5164,2.9682,4.1844,6.6539,0.6549,1.6826,5.5787,0.503,0.5743,3.5766,0.5507,3.8739,0.0001,3.3973,5.4203,3.6834,2.1735,2.9179,3.7865,8.1792,1.0668,3.7277,7.3003,3.2765,1.2537,4.6315,7.2835,0.1019,0.7527,8.7868,1.2201,0.4197,4.1176,0.3033,0.2104,4.8382,0.6805,0.003,3.3459,1.1457,0.1349,2.3402,5.9777,0.3427,1.5135,1.8477,2.8938,0.7113,2.0682,2.819,0.0005,2.388,2.8016,6.11,2.7193,0.356,1.2031,6.8783,5.9076,0.5203,2.991,3.1427,1.7278,4.5807,1.5431,0.0203,0.0101,2.5151,5.982,3.4166,2.34,4.8087,2.4307,3.2712,0.1387,1.4913,5.1228,2.0366,1.547,5.463,0.9839,2.6609,1.1861,1.1731,1.0527,4.7747,0.2674,1.1056,0.4025,4.0622,5.974,3.0092,2.0994,5.1563,3.9572,4.0087,1.7868,5.1654,1.1625,4.589,5.7114,3.7037,2.9151,2.2289,2.6133,3.4089,2.8443,0.6715,0.9203,3.598,4.9374,0.0133,1.0567,1.1074,6.0051,0.0531,1.0915,0.4836,1.5454,4.8082,2.1946,2.5199,4.3488,0.469,4.4917,0.4039,8.8436,3.2408,7.1676,5.4139,6.3077,4.4423,1.3415,2.6374,1.2733,1.114,4.4572,0.8276,0.8879,1.8366,1.9816,0.0922,6.3947,0.1206,0.7679,5.5203,5.8533,1.1433,1.584,0.0015,0.5978,1.5939,0.0222,1.2615,2.7711,2.0432,1.8291,3.2638,0.0025,0.1558,0.2011,0.2982,4.5132,3.015,1.3347,1.4669,0.2229,0.6265,7.2144,1.4346,2.3707,5.8702,3.0566,1.1308,2.4607,3.1737,1.864,3.4165,0.6983,0.0512,3.3584,4.5634,1.4786,6.3097,0.2132,3.0233,1.0675]}

{"prompt":"A Dutchman wielding a knife was shot by military police on Friday at Amsterdam s Schiphol Airport and taken into custody , an official said . There were no reports of other injuries . The","text":"A Dutchman wielding a knife was shot by military police on Friday at Amsterdam s Schiphol Airport and taken into custody, an official said. There were no reports of other injuries. The man had been on a standby list for potential radicalization and was not being vetted as a terrorist, a police spokesperson said. The man entered the airport without a reservation and attempted to board a flight on the basis of a false travel document, police sources said. The suspect allegedly attacked another group of Dutch passengers, wounding them. He is understood to have offered threats of violence to the security forces on the basis he would be armed in an attempt to commit a possible attack, the press said. The suspect had been on a standby list as part of the new anti-terrorist strategy unveiled by the government in November, which involved checking people s passports at airports in case they might require special checks. The new measures became enacted after the Amsterdam attack on 22 July. At that time a Muslim suspected of having radicalization links stabbed two people to death in central Amsterdam. The man also attacked police in the attack. Schiphol Airport, where Friday s attack took place, had already installed metal detectors and thermal imaging systems to screen possible terrorists. A suspect was arrested earlier in the day, said the Amsterdam Public Prosecutor s office, which is cooperating with the army and the police. A security fence was established between the airport entrance and the rest of the area and the number of police had been stepped up, said police spokesperson Robby De Vos. The airport had already implemented measures in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 1 March in Paris, when 20 people were killed. On Tuesday, the public prosecutor said that the airport was now at a heightened security level based on the airport management s decision.

Lufthansa Group, which owns Swiss, Lufthansa, and Lufthansa Cargo, had already suspended flights to and from Japan for several weeks. Reuters reported that the airline is currently carrying out a review of its flights to the country.\nThe latest announcement came after the North ran a fourth test of what it called an intercontinental ballistic missile on Jan. 8. North Korea\u2019s fifth and sixth nuclear test, which came two weeks after the first three tests, came during that timeframe as well.\nLufthansa operates one route to the area, between Berlin and Tokyo, via Frankfurt. Lufthansa said it could not confirm if the changes were related to the missile tests, which have seen U.S.-led air pressure campaigns launched.\nLufthansa said on Saturday the North Korean missile tests have significantly impacted the German government\u2019s decision to review international routes to and from the country. This does not include the flight itself, the airline noted, which it said is affected by security controls. Lufthansa told Reuters that none of its planes have suffered damage or been impacted by the missile tests.\nThe company noted a similar situation has caused the German government to review its plans for flights to South Korea during and after the ongoing South Korean presidential elections.\nThe company added its flight network to Japan is set to remain unchanged. An employee at an Lufthansa flight to Taiwan said no flights from the Japanese city of Osaka have been cancelled, but flights to Taipei are cancelled.\nNorth Korea\u2019s latest missile test comes two days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced that the country\u2019s economy is improving.","token_len":375,"entropy":[7.7409,6.4087,4.1934,0.1014,0.0184,0.0,4.8171,3.3309,2.3473,1.8777,1.8865,6.3969,0.5393,5.3034,4.6299,1.1549,6.0894,3.6105,0.2299,5.6157,1.5822,1.8834,0.3168,0.4686,6.5369,0.0001,0.0023,0.0087,0.0005,8.3155,2.3859,1.0726,2.1001,8.4561,4.7592,6.086,0.0745,0.0882,0.0365,0.0044,3.8628,2.0191,4.0346,0.1826,0.4605,0.0569,0.0116,6.2879,0.6577,3.7686,3.6268,4.988,1.5067,0.5172,3.2342,0.0039,1.8066,2.465,3.1573,1.3855,1.1585,7.2609,1.3792,0.9277,1.3665,1.6372,3.4416,3.6996,4.4544,4.3829,1.9558,3.2239,0.2505,0.5225,3.0006,1.0527,2.2823,1.92,0.6952,0.6223,12.9626,5.1914,5.5685,1.535,1.8533,2.0865,2.2173,9.8019,1.1502,6.2702,1.0405,0.5888,4.3843,0.9507,1.4377,2.1475,1.7266,0.0054,0.0056,0.0066,2.6825,4.9014,0.0595,3.0495,0.7642,3.528,0.1811,18.0012,7.6459,3.2927,4.8322,2.1722,0.6837,0.518,1.5119,2.3692,1.9136,3.5863,3.0151,1.9946,0.4717,1.1898,1.9974,5.2666,2.6574,0.3734,2.9138,4.4109,5.4679,5.1551,3.661,1.4866,0.2677,0.6723,4.8512,0.0322,0.008,0.0063,0.0006,6.6741,5.1631,8.646,1.7773,1.8081,7.2614,1.1965,5.499,6.4315,0.1306,1.2164,0.3452,5.298,3.1594,1.7872,3.2214,0.0016,0.0052,0.0041,0.0006,1.9833,1.5899,4.167,1.4332,1.2881,3.5237,1.0078,4.9652,0.7792,1.3213,0.0486,1.1194,3.7049,1.1057,1.622,3.0993,2.6868,5.6805,5.4766,0.0011,0.0103,2.1953,1.2895,2.6898,7.098,6.2589,4.1917,2.137,0.4332,3.1376,0.0259,0.0055,0.0032,0.0008,1.6006,1.9464,3.4401,3.4749,2.9407,3.7843,1.6045,1.5173,3.6362,5.5608,4.2544,1.5437,4.7785,4.3273,6.0843,0.1686,0.2917,2.6471,0.3627,7.0173,4.9731,6.5333,1.4591,1.3039,0.0088,0.7642,0.3815,0.3922,6.0496,5.865,0.0419,3.3257,1.4254,4.6687,7.9134,0.6842,2.6551,0.5096,6.014,1.6014,2.4149,2.8521,0.5801,2.0081,4.9367,0.2406,6.7741,5.6971,0.9903,4.2494,0.0016,0.006,0.004,0.0011,4.7205,0.746,1.2159,7.6014,0.0148,0.8924,3.7451,1.8696,5.5901,3.0075,2.8588,3.544,3.1175,0.5291,0.8819,1.51,0.3674,0.3125,0.2926,1.7947,2.775,5.1523,4.5495,4.571,2.8036,4.5962,6.7703,2.928,1.5847,0.3277,0.1473,3.7322,0.9901,4.3151,1.4335,3.1289,0.375,4.6003,0.0133,4.3612,4.479,0.2545,0.4348,7.0564,3.052,0.1223,2.8861,1.3275,0.8686,0.8576,1.8903,1.8367,3.2441,5.1826,3.1223,6.3408,1.1789,3.1549,3.6472,5.6729,0.0598,4.8281,2.7496,1.5439,6.1576,5.3551,0.942,3.5941,1.6131,0.0026,0.0043,0.0114,0.0007,3.2647,3.907,5.5989,1.6969,5.9999,1.8081,2.7126,1.4354,3.7138,3.0519,2.2579,2.408,2.4582,0.2843,2.0467,2.4927,2.3528,4.9705,1.0216,4.7374,0.0005,2.37,5.4969,1.2043,0.7588,3.8022,0.143,3.4378,0.0081,0.0511,2.2708,1.6913,0.1973,1.814,3.1023,1.9961,0.0703,2.354,1.8485,0.9745,0.0172,0.0041,0.126,4.176,1.7426,1.6071,0.6651,6.6741,0.01,0.0064,5.754,1.7092,7.0865,1.3467]}

The United States has the final say over how many of the world s 192 states recognize the capital of a neighboring country.\nUnder the agreement signed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinian residents will get U.S. green cards if they remain in their homes. Israel, on the other hand, doesn t allow Palestinians from Gaza living in the strip into Israel without an exit permit.\nThe Palestinians fear such a policy, with the Trump administration claiming it isnt a policy, but merely a requirement for Palestinian workers to get visas to enter the United States. Israeli officials are opposed to the Green Card deal and have claimed that Palestinian workers will simply move to Israel to work and earn money, taking away jobs from Israeli citizens.\nTrump said during a campaign rally that, as he was traveling in Jerusalem, Israelis were getting upset because Palestinians would have to pay property taxes in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem property tax, according to Palestinians, amounts to an Israeli Arab equivalent of $1,500 and it includes a Palestinian Arab tax of $250.\n\u201cWhat are they going to do?

()\nChina argues that the draft resolution does not go far enough and insists that all nations in the world must agree to a unified response to North Korea's latest tests.\nChina, one of the few countries not to have condemned Pyongyang's tests and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, has shown no inclination to put pressure on North Korea, the diplomat said, arguing that Beijing \"doesn't want to be blamed.\"\nSome Western diplomats have expressed frustration at delays in the UN Security Council meeting as the U.S., Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Britain are pushing for a resolution to be voted on by Friday.\nThe five-member committee, whose meetings are attended by the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- and Germany, is expected to pass a new draft resolution that China pushed hard for, according to a senior U.S. diplomat close to diplomatic talks, but that some Western members have indicated are too \"soft\" on North Korea.\n\"It's still going in a direction that the Americans would like, but it's going in the wrong direction in terms of the Europeans, and some of the other countries that wanted a more firm tone.\"\nThe draft was first reported on Monday by the South Korean government and since circulated widely. China and Russia vetoed a vote on a similar resolution in December, though they did not say why they didn't vote against it.","token_len":375,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,5.7928,4.7395,2.146,8.413,2.3874,4.2034,7.9033,5.3829,0.0038,0.3125,0.0188,0.4258,1.614,1.4711,0.0306,2.5278,3.2062,4.814,2.3791,1.1582,4.7625,5.0005,1.2931,2.9865,2.0426,1.065,4.005,0.0007,0.091,0.1681,0.1372,0.0012,2.1131,2.4233,6.376,0.1406,0.3968,3.8863,2.5146,7.552,0.7576,3.2919,2.5826,4.8232,2.0646,1.5794,0.3085,14.9069,3.58,0.4403,1.5055,1.1014,2.8314,1.0612,3.8769,1.3607,3.0417,0.2406,0.3135,2.12,6.1455,3.4789,8.3119,2.4724,0.2793,1.2144,0.9681,1.8989,0.8427,3.9568,6.6237,4.951,1.8033,1.6945,5.704,1.4767,2.2494,0.5422,0.1271,0.1928,14.7674,0.5378,2.6323,7.4845,0.3411,1.3276,3.5101,0.5127,2.9869,0.039,3.8126,0.1454,0.0037,1.4925,5.8362,0.8204,4.2526,4.9822,3.3273,0.1868,2.1446,2.1627,3.5757,0.8606,2.7414,5.943,3.4988,1.4329,0.8109,0.0682,0.6129,3.2842,5.9067,0.6181,0.8232,1.8141,3.3404,4.7479,0.0181,0.3637,3.412,2.0189,3.7932,0.8703,2.5022,6.4842,2.2269,1.0731,6.3052,3.002,5.7855,0.1923,0.3108,6.073,0.8813,0.0049,0.1716,1.3175,0.8643,6.179,1.7068,3.1131,0.1284,5.172,1.5469,0.0183,2.3296,0.0675,1.2246,2.2752,0.614,0.0592,2.1918,4.6904,0.3278,2.7195,4.96,3.3866,0.0004,1.0059,0.4346,2.1513,4.8607,2.515,0.3744,5.1821,3.7592,1.0815,1.9391,2.3792,3.4715,1.6417,9.1236,0.2996,1.531,5.4291,0.8744,0.0008,3.125,4.4828,1.7756,2.4911,0.0005,0.5049,2.0974,5.6134,0.8597,2.1073,0.9161,4.2136,0.0047,0.4313,3.83,3.3309,4.1938,0.5239,0.9867,2.1689,1.8142,4.2635,3.5416,0.094,1.5755,7.1174,0.5707,0.5367,1.8131,5.8062,1.5367,0.4256,5.497,2.2557,5.0611,5.9691,0.8157,5.7291,0.0785,2.5139,4.6123,1.3062,0.0317,0.1594,0.0406,1.3759,0.0011,4.8563,2.2347,1.1287,0.0803,0.0252,2.4049,0.0196,0.5512,0.0873,1.7289,0.6793,0.1796,0.0641,5.1918,6.0959,0.3004,1.4502,1.3842,0.0063,3.9496,1.4968,3.5097,2.3436,0.4808,4.2354,3.9317,8.117,5.2943,1.1188,3.0527,2.7405,0.0019,1.1744,0.9649,0.9415,0.0005,0.0767,0.0014,2.3785,4.2337,0.0018,6.3624,2.6595,3.7363,2.6716,2.5928,4.7985,3.7844,4.1784,2.0959,4.4631,3.2906,3.6765,5.7066,3.9607,0.8971,0.5779,0.949,0.0193,0.4779,0.2328,2.969,2.2347,0.6466,4.9842,3.9653,4.8382,2.839,4.6419,0.5727,2.9598,4.6611,4.0533,0.932,2.7692,0.9767,1.48,0.481,2.6493,1.1304,2.1212,0.4188,0.0132,4.8107,1.5014,0.003,1.7764,8.5039,2.0146,2.4678,4.7351,0.5324,0.8016,1.7949,1.3179,1.6624,6.8018,2.3827,2.5969,4.9419,4.6311,5.4337,0.4883,1.5124,2.8292,5.137,2.8335,1.0021,2.3082,2.2158,0.8501,1.1757,3.4953,1.7111,4.1091,3.4985,8.3807,7.6801,3.1564,4.7494,4.5176,2.3238,1.6829,5.7023,1.7698,4.672,0.8948,2.8737,4.3499,0.4984,1.7472,2.4784,1.1955,4.1641,2.8813,2.652,0.4094,3.7794,3.3995,1.7084,3.5457,0.001,2.6963,2.5599,0.5504,0.2837]}

He was freed on bail in 2013 and has lived in the Netherlands since.","token_len":377,"entropy":[9.6052,0.2864,2.8308,3.7706,7.6423,5.7143,5.2142,0.3979,1.5434,9.9808,3.1637,1.6048,8.9112,6.2792,2.1412,0.0771,5.6985,6.6515,0.8131,1.4044,1.6803,0.007,1.2389,3.6564,6.6756,6.3103,8.0714,2.0562,2.4836,3.5184,1.7865,2.7833,3.5555,1.6323,0.0278,7.4887,3.0809,2.2856,3.1696,0.2142,3.1791,3.4869,3.3157,1.222,0.2244,16.9301,1.8512,3.6666,0.0122,0.7575,3.2735,2.822,0.6327,2.0673,5.2767,1.3033,10.4464,2.7646,9.6555,9.9742,1.7907,0.6347,5.9519,0.0199,1.5473,3.999,1.4844,4.9505,1.273,3.0138,0.018,3.1133,1.5017,1.6555,3.3656,0.2091,0.8825,3.4163,0.0484,5.9623,0.2385,1.1965,1.1382,0.006,1.6279,4.1959,0.0123,0.5652,0.4016,0.7001,2.3178,1.3647,7.3165,7.4651,0.2452,1.271,6.2873,0.9556,3.7398,1.9389,6.475,0.0074,2.8396,0.625,2.0896,1.0236,1.963,4.9408,5.8276,0.7329,3.8445,6.565,5.1525,2.2964,8.6536,2.3839,0.8374,0.4808,2.4181,1.0005,0.2733,1.9265,0.4283,3.38,2.0951,3.3312,0.0009,0.5187,6.0699,2.9024,0.0187,0.2227,2.7126,1.7053,2.4719,0.1268,4.6667,1.246,5.0556,3.0611,3.4801,1.9865,6.3236,4.059,0.0429,2.9334,7.427,1.7928,5.0112,0.3401,1.5787,1.3863,5.3015,1.7795,0.02,2.9795,2.3267,2.1654,0.5483,1.7578,3.7097,3.0756,3.7327,7.14,1.5561,2.1816,4.8036,1.3895,3.775,2.0233,2.5638,1.1282,0.1318,1.9615,0.6027,2.0115,2.7001,2.6909,3.1754,1.7356,0.0099,7.0295,1.2768,2.0805,3.157,4.6779,2.6141,0.5628,2.5117,3.1728,4.3501,1.0397,0.3312,1.1727,3.7521,0.5872,4.6743,0.6752,5.5669,8.4266,0.5395,2.9463,0.0275,1.3896,1.6958,1.6281,4.3064,2.0542,2.4696,11.1297,1.2665,2.297,4.7694,4.3337,4.2049,2.3144,1.1002,2.966,3.7331,0.2971,6.4017,4.7573,6.4247,5.8596,4.0156,1.1749,6.416,0.4229,3.3697,4.7283,0.6107,0.2763,0.7216,0.3111,0.5411,1.6703,0.67,6.2006,0.1195,3.0988,4.1231,3.7368,2.7966,1.3315,3.769,5.0293,1.2561,1.9631,5.4091,3.3326,5.4935,0.4447,5.0162,2.4611,2.4629,2.0133,4.8913,1.7397,2.0294,3.4038,4.687,5.9902,6.8016,6.1407,0.734,0.201,1.3865,1.5595,1.5358,4.2438,5.14,1.8982,10.7648,1.0339,2.8228,1.0877,3.1994,3.679,0.8233,1.7348,0.4508,1.2487,4.3759,0.5747,0.4618,1.1901,2.8743,6.144,5.0788,0.0014,2.3236,2.7883,0.5058,5.6297,0.6642,2.0698,4.5711,3.2497,1.333,3.0281,2.1354,3.9918,1.365,1.4744,3.7007,2.5213,4.0218,2.0011,8.0742,2.0738,3.1556,1.5489,5.1771,0.8452,1.9375,4.8544,1.9115,2.8839,4.2693,0.1783,4.1688,2.7284,1.1939,1.8301,1.3945,4.6418,2.147,4.0744,3.3483,0.4173,0.8879,0.1911,0.4368,5.2932,0.6643,3.6971,0.0112,0.6547,3.5264,0.2965,2.3259,2.0316,1.1385,4.1106,4.5522,1.3073,0.0311,2.3406,5.5842,3.0687,3.3044,7.5695,5.7392,1.2754,1.5133,0.052,3.8011,0.1694,0.363,0.2517,0.618,2.1064,1.242,3.4645,2.3996,1.117,1.6631,2.9388,2.0863,1.8551,2.9512,0.3576,1.7028,0.1414,1.2825,0.9372]}

The United States has proposed an open debate on human rights for next month s group s meeting, a US official told Reuters after the meeting in Vienna (Reuters, 17 October). U.S. officials are seeking a special U.N. Human Rights Council meeting to discuss North Korea s human rights record this month, a new United Nations official said in New York (Reuters, 17 October). According to an agreement reached in Vienna, the panel will be expected to issue a report to the United Nations General Assembly in 2010. Members of the panel will be selected in November to begin discussions next month. According to reports in Hong Kong, the panel could receive reports from the North with sanctions on them, or even a nuclear weapon that North Korea wants to use as evidence (Reuters, 16 October). Presidents from countries bordering the North, including China and South Korea, have been meeting to discuss U.S. efforts to isolate North Korea and its economic sanctions (Reuters, 10 October). The panel on the issue has not been as active as some member states hoped. The Human Rights Council did not discuss North Korea s detention of U.S. diplomat and citizen, Kim Chol, and the murder of another U.S. tourist, Kim Jong-nam, last year. The human rights panel, however, recommended that all governments stop using torture, which is illegal under international law. The statement, issued by the Human Rights Council, said that while the sanctions against North Korea were expected to have an impact, they d also require a reassessment in its human rights record.

Ambassador","text":"The United States has lost trust in South Sudan \u2019 s government for fueling the country \u2019 s civil war and it must bring peace or risk losing support from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to Sudan David Schenker told reporters Tuesday. \u201c If we see the peace process falter, I think the relationship with the United States will deteriorate, \u201d Schenker told reporters in New York about the country where the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations is also in the employ of the U.S. State Department. \u201c We will be more hesitant to give further economic assistance \u201d to Sudan, he argued. The diplomats\u2019 latest comments were the latest example of the conflict in Sudan, which has killed hundreds of people. \u201c We have seen a number of violent incidents that are undermining the peace process in Sudan, and in many respects the peace process is our best hope of ending what\u2019s been going on in Sudan over the past many years, \u201d Schenker said. The U.S. believes that a unified Sudan will be more stable, Schenker reiterated. In this connection, the U.S. has requested China to consider imposing sanctions on Sudan in the event of an imminent crisis in the nation, as the United States does. If the United States finds a way to bring the Sudanese government and opposition together, it will help, the ambassador said, asserting that the mission has a good track record in doing so in Afghanistan. \u201c But it is always a dangerous and fragile process because the opposition still uses violence, \u201d Schenker added. In 2011, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in a military coup and the civilian government, based in Khartoum, which is known as the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N).","token_len":377,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,5.1546,8.4745,0.2382,7.3554,3.3282,14.3254,7.0786,8.7907,4.1279,4.3729,7.8835,1.9923,3.6403,5.9263,0.1346,2.3203,2.0642,0.0394,2.6814,5.669,4.3384,6.0031,4.1896,6.2914,3.0713,2.2102,4.3191,1.0916,3.7653,2.9595,4.8632,0.0468,0.0785,0.2059,3.9241,0.5221,2.8623,4.8069,6.0527,3.9742,1.4783,1.7883,1.5191,3.0735,0.3349,2.9892,5.1955,6.5635,2.5063,5.5207,2.3491,5.2224,1.0712,4.7877,0.8924,0.6598,3.542,1.2847,2.3277,7.5038,1.2509,0.8705,0.605,0.0271,1.1242,2.1287,0.0001,2.4406,4.8534,6.3042,2.7205,0.0087,0.0034,1.973,0.3942,2.0592,3.3452,0.1259,7.5669,1.0234,4.8083,6.1748,1.5567,1.8687,0.0006,0.0113,0.1841,4.1537,1.8812,0.9551,0.3428,0.0575,1.5591,6.1387,2.9947,1.9808,9.1177,0.0471,0.7652,2.2098,0.0006,0.1568,0.1299,2.1894,0.005,0.4989,1.087,0.7911,5.0236,2.4877,2.4366,4.2405,4.9469,0.4495,3.5805,6.8381,8.465,1.0689,4.5092,3.7838,1.5042,2.7509,1.8587,2.4391,5.5976,0.5084,3.9573,7.2346,7.8619,3.3684,13.3471,2.6589,2.6584,3.437,0.4554,4.8841,0.1416,1.2714,5.9247,1.5329,2.2511,2.3242,1.0714,0.6825,2.6844,3.0773,0.2044,2.6195,2.4304,2.3301,0.8437,5.2974,1.9863,2.736,2.2404,3.0493,0.0018,5.1398,1.3541,3.4001,2.8737,5.444,0.8881,1.6811,0.0604,2.235,1.5755,1.8754,2.1219,3.9529,3.1156,5.5967,2.4428,3.3776,0.0745,1.062,7.7791,2.3685,1.3633,2.2797,3.525,5.2054,7.3581,2.1852,1.8287,0.6671,4.852,0.0684,1.7286,1.4093,6.1263,0.1785,0.8537,6.525,0.3557,2.185,1.5406,1.1561,1.0757,0.0022,0.0019,0.5158,0.1024,3.3612,1.868,0.0007,0.0062,0.1472,5.3088,0.7011,3.8062,5.3846,1.2531,2.04,2.026,2.3704,1.8975,1.5922,7.6745,0.002,0.0021,6.2008,0.2908,4.5977,4.1912,6.8402,0.0887,1.9033,1.3796,0.0008,0.0126,0.0743,2.1957,5.3691,7.3409,0.9213,5.1696,7.5055,1.0478,0.4828,0.4113,2.9728,1.9707,1.7776,0.4331,2.2845,4.3246,3.2213,2.4442,0.6155,4.445,1.8418,4.1936,2.6718,2.5699,0.0665,3.2414,3.5152,5.0379,1.468,1.5075,0.0044,5.3129,2.8837,0.8326,0.135,3.7495,2.2009,1.9435,0.2373,1.2828,3.2197,5.5555,2.0504,0.6451,1.7255,1.2009,2.5752,4.9074,2.4374,1.4832,0.4842,2.6534,7.4546,0.1354,0.9648,7.1759,3.2452,3.1017,4.9763,1.343,0.0013,1.9203,4.9847,0.3938,5.7239,6.2925,1.0195,2.0851,0.4038,4.4265,2.9266,1.1109,6.2323,2.1242,5.073,3.7781,4.9911,2.3976,4.8744,2.2624,5.489,6.6295,5.392,1.6385,1.79,2.2098,0.5997,0.8304,0.0011,0.0014,2.5712,0.1021,3.6786,5.7888,0.1927,2.9955,3.1004,1.4571,0.6837,0.1351,0.1007,0.0815,0.002,0.0093,3.076,2.8359,2.8658,0.2273,1.8298,0.0372,2.1699,2.2163,6.5685,1.1069,3.7771,5.1531,0.9633,2.8452,0.0022,0.0,0.0002,0.1085,5.9103,1.8553,5.2069,1.3203,1.0742,4.3699,1.0818,8.7542,0.1467,0.855,3.1602,3.5276,6.7068,4.0588,0.8622,1.3941,0.5848,0.3906,0.7542,4.242]}

The Trump campaign has sharply criticized the FTC and the report. It released statements saying that a government report designed to destroy the companies\u2019 businesses and jobs is \u201canother attempt by Democrat-run Washington to further stifle free speech and private business. \u201d The paper called for the FTC to issue temporary restraining orders on Google and Facebook over the ads they run on their platforms, saying they are \u201cdisingenuously portraying their service as neutral when in actuality it has been effectively and purposefully biased in supporting particular political views. \u201d The authors note that the FTC\u2019s move does nothing to fix the problem. \u201d Whether the FTC orders to stop political ads are the right approach remains unclear because the law requires the commission to focus on antitrust violations rather than civil rights, and the commission has no authority to enforce rules or require compliance,\u201d they wrote.","token_len":377,"entropy":[9.0148,5.6194,5.5911,0.2149,12.8282,8.9584,9.2717,2.3604,3.071,7.4662,3.0075,0.1395,0.0049,7.4546,0.8874,6.2688,8.5754,4.708,3.2349,1.5387,3.1441,0.001,2.5817,7.5197,0.0043,0.0036,0.035,3.9097,2.3826,2.8325,2.9766,6.0669,0.1811,7.6162,5.5858,2.9949,5.0173,1.7363,2.2077,0.1893,9.597,4.0925,5.3748,4.6245,6.0475,5.864,3.9579,3.4422,2.5828,3.0925,0.8449,6.5871,4.7421,3.1258,2.6624,5.6876,0.9395,1.5881,3.1968,1.2913,1.0793,0.2119,7.5608,0.0056,0.485,5.9616,2.5891,5.4379,1.473,7.6878,6.0973,0.4633,4.1772,0.9296,9.3773,5.9761,6.4673,6.151,3.4922,5.0732,3.8173,1.5767,15.7787,4.701,3.7143,6.5609,1.8015,2.9215,3.1966,3.3614,3.0234,2.032,2.128,10.2471,3.8904,3.3354,5.2174,7.5811,0.7383,0.0747,2.691,0.9198,0.3712,1.3546,5.467,2.3425,0.0395,0.0015,0.0023,0.0343,0.0022,2.9647,4.2842,2.3657,0.0907,10.8628,0.6186,2.4052,0.4016,2.0691,0.5577,6.991,5.4888,0.0007,3.3662,4.8607,0.3183,6.2972,3.3572,2.571,3.7339,3.3481,2.8534,3.1346,3.78,3.2534,0.7561,0.4685,5.638,0.2675,1.4014,1.4166,0.8852,9.4737,1.7579,2.8493,0.2395,2.4292,5.5103,4.5727,2.4988,0.3191,0.1517,1.5518,2.163,0.0003,0.0055,0.0016,3.309,1.3143,0.0011,3.8691,2.7708,2.7241,0.229,0.825,5.3695,6.1443,3.7244,1.07,0.4382,1.5897,1.7374,2.4635,1.8396,4.147,5.9106,2.1485,1.6821,3.066,4.2044,0.0009,0.0025,5.5025,0.7148,1.3121,1.7893,6.0476,2.3907,5.7637,0.2088,3.9998,4.2292,2.8361,4.4484,2.8682,0.067,0.378,2.6526,0.384,2.2259,4.9793,0.2377,1.4081,7.3431,0.1873,0.7485,2.0278,2.8523,1.1996,6.3034,1.5533,4.0029,5.4903,6.6104,2.0751,1.2323,5.0138,4.4548,3.8318,7.9794,0.0414,7.4137,1.3893,4.3905,7.0048,0.0383,14.6863,2.9069,5.0865,2.0377,11.7771,3.2123,10.6976,3.3201,1.6231,9.5097,2.9446,3.845,4.9696,0.9941,6.116,5.5559,0.4355,0.8244,0.0926,1.3715,6.6423,2.7062,0.8099,2.9369,0.2255,1.489,5.1243,4.0569,1.8325,1.6475,1.3314,0.2007,3.8479,7.022,1.3017,0.0066,2.3028,1.7861,1.3937,2.0752,5.3065,0.9409,2.8214,3.7132,1.1547,1.4388,1.005,4.0209,1.2529,2.426,1.8996,2.0112,9.6046,0.4367,6.0282,3.0964,0.0041,2.1668,7.6545,2.5283,6.1228,0.153,3.2186,4.8848,1.4694,4.4396,0.2145,1.6242,3.6052,2.0027,7.3997,5.0491,4.5384,3.6842,2.8393,6.6768,8.5752,0.7113,2.7444,0.438,2.6171,0.1201,1.3498,5.7343,4.8064,0.1407,1.4449,1.4903,5.7951,0.0869,0.2776,5.4306,4.6298,4.1609,0.1446,5.7384,0.647,1.2323,1.5232,3.5301,0.1282,8.1546,1.4832,1.1231,4.5465,4.6637,0.492,5.3411,0.3765,6.2938,4.2345,2.1242,5.3399,1.7059,2.9798,5.5283,1.0855,4.6938,3.1039,1.7639,2.6949,0.077,7.6092,0.672,6.0662,1.8812,1.6284,0.0041,5.0919,1.3019,2.9565,2.6993,1.5494,3.407,1.4071,2.7966,1.3285,0.1714,2.7602,4.6957,2.6885,5.8341,4.1463,4.0871,10.4129,2.4264,4.2103,2.3617,0.1439]}
{"prompt":"President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s chances of surviving the political crisis gripping Peru faded on Friday after Congress passed a motion to start presidential vacancy procedures with enough votes to unseat him within a week","text":"President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s chances of surviving the political crisis gripping Peru faded on Friday after Congress passed a motion to start presidential vacancy procedures with enough votes to unseat him within a week. A vote at a specially convened congressional committee will set the stage for the vote of a full house on the motion.\nThe congressional panel had previously agreed to the motion but later changed its mind before it was formally voted on. It approved vacating Kuczynski and setting up a series of special hearings on charges, including being a political mule for more than $200,000 in illegal payments made to foreign women. He has denied all wrongdoing.\nAt least eight women, including three US citizens, have accused Kuczynski of paying them tens of thousands of dollars to keep them silent, helping close to 100 of his businesses. The accusations threaten to tear a once strong ally of Mr Kuczynski apart and weaken the presidential government.\nDemand for an early election has also risen amid mounting calls from Congress to dissolve the legislative body, which Mr Kuczynski has vowed to defend. The president has rejected calls for him to step down on charges against him, saying he is not guilty and a vote to oust him would be considered unconstitutional.\nMeanwhile, the prime minister resigned on Friday as lawmakers demanded new elections to choose a successor to the former president Alberto Fujimori, who has faced hundreds of impeachment charges in his 15 years as President.\n\"It is absolutely clear that what we are asking for is not an effort to destroy democracy or to stop any process that could help the country return to an honest political equilibrium,\" Mr Pedro Pablo told his first press conference that left no doubt about his resignation.\nCongress on Friday also called for new elections in three states, after the electoral boards in the regions were dissolved by the Supreme Court to avoid conflict between candidates who had been disqualified.","token_len":377,"entropy":[11.5591,2.4762,0.1776,0.0516,0.0191,10.4138,10.5132,0.2679,3.009,1.6901,5.494,1.0793,6.562,4.5633,10.1748,3.2879,2.4466,2.1006,5.936,2.672,0.6385,5.3595,1.6523,5.9896,6.6403,13.1226,4.7943,5.3017,7.6989,1.0406,0.48,7.38,0.0617,3.9563,6.0217,2.188,1.0733,0.2388,4.9746,2.6704,5.2449,3.1136,8.3714,0.6333,4.5499,1.4973,3.1252,4.7837,1.1364,0.6457,0.0344,1.5145,3.2411,4.082,2.9747,3.676,3.7476,3.1858,2.0968,5.1657,1.0642,0.7148,14.0516,6.2911,4.6092,4.0155,3.6392,4.4795,0.3243,3.8727,2.0826,2.1611,5.2996,2.9747,0.5503,0.1324,5.873,1.1823,2.0151,3.9076,3.706,0.1779,0.5974,3.5418,4.757,11.2541,0.0248,2.8338,0.0008,0.0005,3.4381,4.4337,0.6716,0.8598,5.9897,0.0008,3.2408,4.4675,1.9601,8.6225,4.8909,1.0497,7.1973,1.6001,3.7035,5.1358,2.3444,3.6347,6.86,0.0194,5.4819,3.0716,0.7404,0.002,0.8796,2.9616,3.2213,3.0698,0.5736,5.2703,6.9874,1.6057,5.2485,1.8752,1.6991,2.5341,1.745,0.6488,0.2607,5.2912,1.4458,3.9956,2.2951,3.2023,0.4276,3.1593,6.0739,2.8535,0.2784,0.4421,0.9949,0.4962,0.0015,0.0002,0.1963,4.3441,0.757,4.9392,0.0234,0.0748,0.0477,0.0459,1.6755,5.0526,0.5373,2.6455,2.5159,7.9254,8.5752,6.5914,3.2731,2.5915,1.7576,4.0994,1.2735,2.0932,3.9127,6.3908,0.1888,5.0556,3.4588,5.9678,4.2719,4.6431,2.653,4.8631,1.0499,0.0006,0.0008,2.7556,1.9604,4.1361,1.7098,5.3362,4.8264,0.6729,0.3355,11.5332,0.9744,3.8052,4.7386,1.2341,2.2362,3.3996,2.7887,3.0778,3.5027,2.7109,2.3936,5.251,1.1533,5.7113,0.5429,4.907,0.7732,2.0071,1.0362,4.6176,0.0984,0.0007,0.0011,1.4904,3.1896,0.2724,4.9601,0.6691,2.4574,3.3755,1.2367,5.1112,1.552,1.0975,2.6268,0.0211,0.7469,0.3123,4.911,2.948,4.6664,0.973,1.4813,1.2926,0.9482,1.7894,2.6134,4.0963,1.7015,5.1033,3.6717,2.7999,2.315,0.0912,0.7211,1.0735,5.5047,3.2328,0.2444,0.3443,6.7755,0.2398,1.8581,4.9408,0.019,5.2961,1.5446,0.7845,2.7417,5.7117,5.1953,5.062,1.0024,2.1919,7.0807,1.6167,1.0425,1.1319,1.7535,3.959,1.1983,7.3383,0.3473,0.0155,0.0026,1.2494,0.9434,1.783,3.608,8.1872,0.0042,4.2949,1.2035,2.341,2.4905,5.3343,0.3529,1.4592,3.9081,0.193,0.7572,2.6046,3.0135,0.5791,4.6789,1.861,0.2583,6.1283,2.0432,1.322,3.9702,0.8039,0.5225,1.7587,2.3571,8.6252,0.2848,5.7794,3.6071,2.4602,1.4897,4.8364,4.3593,4.2189,2.1569,2.4634,3.6189,2.2886,1.9861,5.7564,0.0878,4.4884,3.6335,2.408,6.5187,0.406,1.4149,9.4958,0.7738,5.4952,5.2577,5.1681,2.1717,0.0285,7.341,7.4795,2.5876,0.6192,1.4359,1.4323,5.0358,0.2723,0.5288,6.8945,4.8851,0.6071,2.6,4.146,0.4565,4.1872,0.3358,3.031,4.3484,3.9802,1.4729,5.788,1.7528,6.0516,6.2138,2.6078,1.9484,6.1646,3.666,3.3467,2.3415,1.187,3.8437,0.0106,4.4949,3.4527,6.5247,2.8423,4.6486,3.1119,1.7521,2.2906,5.0246,1.0953]}

However, in a public statement Tuesday, U.S. Special Representative for Asia-Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel warned that North Korea's nuclear program risks derailing the entire U.S. regional strategy.\n\"The risk we face is grave and that is why we have to be clear from the outset, all possible steps must be taken and we will take a comprehensive approach,\" Russel said.\nEarlier the UN Security Council issued a stern warning against any new steps toward restarting nuclear programs in North Korea.\n\"We think that the sanctions are having an effect. I think the threats and pressure are working. As we have said before, the consequences if they continue to proceed along this path are gravely and very worrisome,\" the UN Security Council said in a statement.\nThe latest move follows a major U.S. summit that failed to agree on joint steps to freeze North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for an end to United Nations sanctions.\nKim Jong Un, who is regarded as one of the world's most bellicose leaders, is holding the second U.S. summit with the president.\nIn the early hours of Friday, the United States began bombing targets in Syria and announced it was opening new bases to protect its allies in the Middle East.\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants the United States to build a permanent military base in Qatar, a proposal that would potentially anger Iran, a long-time foe of the U.S.","token_len":377,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.8715,0.0287,0.4187,1.4107,0.0113,7.8219,2.1768,6.5501,5.4272,0.601,0.4955,2.4461,0.0941,5.5771,6.6825,0.2166,2.6396,0.0144,1.2261,9.757,3.2907,0.048,1.8893,5.2139,2.3178,0.0008,0.3318,0.0335,3.2516,1.0043,1.1032,6.2459,4.0793,3.8386,3.8455,9.083,0.2779,0.2693,0.1529,2.4467,2.1517,2.8276,0.6661,8.0545,0.2782,1.8512,5.3451,0.4018,0.3001,16.3799,0.0065,0.0001,1.713,3.9938,3.6188,1.5706,1.7221,2.1394,0.0371,5.1625,0.1649,3.1288,2.3393,1.9071,3.5178,0.3986,3.7438,0.0335,0.9614,0.6343,0.6411,3.3692,0.2242,0.0031,6.9882,1.4457,6.6162,0.0163,4.5285,1.4628,5.7782,1.1557,3.3206,0.3003,2.5501,0.0002,0.0333,0.004,6.1724,1.8919,1.5541,3.2985,5.0907,0.0023,0.7953,6.6141,2.4085,0.0821,3.9556,0.4792,2.8857,0.0654,1.4015,2.4259,0.9275,6.3238,8.6547,0.0102,1.3787,4.9272,2.6424,0.0003,0.0088,1.0042,4.6734,3.1336,1.3034,0.1692,1.1879,1.7368,5.5376,5.2249,1.3733,1.1932,7.9465,1.6496,3.7111,1.1147,0.4245,0.698,2.0751,1.3511,2.9507,3.6401,5.2323,0.2248,1.5334,3.2906,5.6269,7.1109,3.1446,2.3319,0.1184,0.0528,4.2074,1.974,1.862,3.3993,4.1776,3.6499,0.8039,1.9394,0.3385,0.0003,0.3417,0.8235,0.5778,6.0698,5.974,6.828,0.4128,0.0014,4.5478,0.2582,4.3167,0.4133,1.5932,2.1042,4.201,4.5031,2.853,7.2052,0.0027,4.2336,6.3878,2.567,3.0735,0.0088,1.0685,0.7997,0.7807,2.0551,5.3398,1.2392,1.5984,4.7541,3.0951,5.7211,0.8376,0.9592,3.1458,3.5271,0.6487,2.1143,6.416,3.6313,3.5183,1.5058,5.2224,2.426,5.1726,1.8644,1.8922,1.0702,1.7934,0.1238,1.8868,5.2845,6.2614,2.009,1.819,1.7867,6.1687,6.4739,1.7329,0.4677,0.8393,2.8214,6.6162,4.5874,3.9661,5.4833,0.4018,2.5958,3.0983,1.2666,0.0016,1.4196,0.8244,0.3384,0.2884,0.5865,0.2283,1.5707,4.5525,3.3813,4.2802,1.2196,5.4703,1.9508,0.0005,0.239,0.3796,5.8424,3.4559,4.5472,0.1232,4.2091,0.5098,8.8136,3.6638,0.8409,5.3428,0.821,0.1277,0.0581,0.3476,0.5211,2.7568,1.2637,0.0069,3.5138,1.4613,0.0098,7.6356,0.0279,0.3811,0.6611,0.6268,5.8755,0.6113,0.2009,1.8077,1.592,1.79,4.4953,0.2744,3.386,0.0117,0.1893,1.5752,0.0063,0.3371,6.5837,0.0003,0.0004,0.5201,0.2097,2.5682,5.8086,3.7548,4.3028,4.052,0.0004,0.6599,0.1324,1.0122,4.6611,2.5818,4.4771,2.8095,1.1254,3.3725,2.5236,5.0382,0.8646,0.1817,3.2813,0.4783,2.0432,2.3098,0.8212,4.9993,6.9023,4.5004,0.399,1.8581,0.9993,8.1151,1.7198,1.2424,5.2896,2.5661,3.552,2.9123,5.0206,2.9028,2.5264,1.7346,0.6788,2.2116,0.0104,0.3728,0.7848,4.7328,0.7812,0.0066,2.803,3.6814,0.5956,0.9329,3.7528,2.6632,0.9109,0.1451,0.1117,4.1616,0.6145,4.8304,0.8328,1.1949,0.3823,6.6299,1.2081,2.1862,4.8627,0.7965,1.8557,5.8837,8.0632,4.0272,1.6344,2.7623,5.638,0.0691,1.0862,2.9751,0.4799,0.6998,1.8616,0.0004,0.0038,0.3697]}

Italian officials told Reuters the agreement was on hold, pending a report to be published next week on the work of the border police formed by UN-backed UN forces. Reuters TV reported in October that the police had seen more than 500 boats over a short period of time, about the same time as they reported a six-fold increase in the number of migrants they took into custody.\nSome 750 immigrants were found on board this summer and all except two were Libyans. On Friday, the Italian Coastguard said two migrants had died in a sinking while trying to make the voyage from the Greek islands of Lesbos and Kos to Libya. An EU decision this year allowed people to try again to cross the seas from North African countries to Spain via the Central Mediterranean and Italy.\nRome said Italy wanted the coastguard to take all responsibility within three years after an EU-backed commission published a report describing Libya\u2019s coastguard as failing to enforce the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.\nMr Matteo Salvini, the far-right leader who is running Italy\u2019s opposition coalition, said Italy \u201cwill not hesitate to use force\u201d to stop the flow of illegal migrants.\nThe United Nations refugee agency said Friday it needed more support in tackling the crisis, which has so far killed more than 370 migrants and refugees travelling en masse and taking advantage of the breakdown of the Libyan coastguard. More than 300 people were dead in recent days when boats left the Libyan coast and sank. The UN has said only about 1,000 asylum seekers have been able to put through its reception centre in Libya.","token_len":378,"entropy":[8.8261,9.6223,10.8995,7.9652,1.235,0.9016,3.4535,3.4834,8.2695,3.2479,2.3183,1.8734,6.5648,0.0344,6.2233,5.2926,10.0195,3.379,6.5491,0.0236,0.7063,1.5393,9.1525,1.3522,4.6605,9.7318,4.4469,0.1054,7.2806,2.9486,4.0097,2.4531,3.5404,4.2868,5.0579,0.0969,2.9521,5.7238,0.2357,4.3356,3.6915,0.0487,0.0014,0.3069,5.5579,2.6843,0.1941,5.6992,1.2456,7.6148,1.6813,4.6339,2.2845,2.1004,6.4647,1.9646,5.1278,2.204,3.159,5.1111,1.9078,3.9177,2.8514,4.8613,2.8304,2.4087,0.6265,2.0293,0.877,6.074,0.8158,0.8646,5.5013,2.296,10.1129,0.7224,6.0214,3.4617,0.8066,4.9991,4.1124,0.8387,5.0484,6.1585,1.7911,3.9881,3.021,0.2089,1.5528,4.1628,1.0876,5.5419,3.4796,0.1757,3.6271,3.274,5.0895,2.6707,6.4752,0.174,0.3243,0.0448,1.4516,5.0654,3.5945,0.3531,4.1375,0.6391,3.2476,4.7799,2.3559,5.8242,0.3922,0.9635,0.1649,0.0906,1.5979,0.1709,0.0378,0.7232,3.7672,5.6952,2.9154,2.4799,0.6712,1.773,16.9142,8.5452,7.0747,1.7591,4.6925,2.7281,2.1626,6.1056,3.5708,3.5205,5.6201,5.4364,3.032,1.3481,7.4533,0.0119,0.0003,0.9082,4.6306,2.8775,0.4461,1.7725,1.953,3.8844,3.0586,1.2769,4.6179,1.8254,1.1085,1.6863,1.6257,2.0085,4.9099,6.418,1.9247,0.0075,3.0429,1.4011,4.9137,1.3476,2.5886,3.8396,2.7953,0.3027,1.2242,0.0062,0.4784,3.5409,1.818,2.3154,0.4306,5.3242,4.1975,6.0983,3.9341,3.1922,6.6401,5.5836,1.501,5.8332,2.0764,2.1604,2.0156,0.7619,6.8123,1.5427,5.9034,4.1024,0.6838,2.0983,5.5691,4.5427,2.2232,6.2718,0.2339,3.687,3.8979,1.4164,1.0948,5.4882,3.8448,3.7066,5.1592,4.9613,2.5907,2.2145,0.2493,0.2393,1.8343,4.1856,2.0569,4.5727,0.5072,0.0248,4.0938,3.7487,2.2184,2.4074,1.6977,3.6946,6.0597,0.7647,0.7047,6.0303,2.8283,17.7415,8.3009,1.2814,2.1802,0.1389,0.3385,4.1414,0.1895,4.3543,1.5973,6.0557,2.7103,7.0416,0.01,0.0042,0.159,3.7884,0.0076,0.017,1.0514,1.3885,5.9356,5.568,0.0616,3.7999,0.0262,0.2998,1.1207,6.4271,0.0763,0.125,1.2772,1.9215,2.4744,3.1837,3.7787,6.8569,0.0806,0.0093,6.8572,2.8817,0.4932,0.9347,2.647,6.9653,7.9242,6.1542,1.2126,4.767,0.0925,3.6817,0.6652,8.4512,7.8944,1.153,1.7801,2.2168,2.5285,0.1818,3.7403,0.252,1.3841,0.9986,3.1048,4.8779,0.3612,2.7423,0.0124,1.0416,5.0532,1.5329,6.9358,2.5989,4.8302,3.0174,4.5435,0.587,2.7265,1.9637,2.7662,0.9414,5.7526,0.0026,2.7538,1.4582,0.1043,6.1957,4.7756,1.4521,3.1214,7.7263,7.5141,1.3458,5.9761,6.2366,5.5634,0.0012,1.5998,7.7661,0.6785,1.4985,4.7623,2.1295,0.4927,0.7502,5.5402,0.0934,3.6367,2.0179,1.9663,5.388,1.4089,4.9228,0.6392,2.9595,3.0893,5.8139,1.975,1.2587,0.4149,2.3407,3.6224,2.5794,2.7082,2.0775,2.3806,1.5701,5.3599,2.1977,2.7578,0.1443,0.9593,4.1979,0.3158,1.1549,0.7813,4.6617,0.0101,8.8699,4.1412,3.1981,7.7103,1.3743,1.2143,1.7496,0.911]}

The embassy statement also quoted Volozhin as saying that Trump showed some understanding of the Russian state, its history, and its interests. Putin has a record of using diplomatic means to push through his plans to annex Crimea in 2014 and install a hardcore pro Kremlin regime in Moscow, but he also has a history of using force against Moscow\u2019s opponents. In 2010, Putin threatened Syria in retaliation for a missile attack on troops being transported by a Russian convoy near the Syrian border. Assad responded by killing Russian naval and ground forces that carried out a similar attack on Syrian rebels.\nIt is not my intention to take too much credit for creating this recipe.

{"prompt":"Germany should be more assertive in setting foreign policy according to its own interests rather than to those of the United States , the German foreign minister said on Tuesday . Traditionally close ties between","text":"Germany should be more assertive in setting foreign policy according to its own interests rather than to those of the United States, the German foreign minister said on Tuesday. Traditionally close ties between Angela Merkel and Barack Obama have been increasingly strained over the years, particularly when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal. Merkel has refused to lift the sanctions on the Islamic republic even as she has tried to bring forward a resumption of normal relations, and Obama has said that he hopes to see the U.N. Security Council meeting on Iran next week as the first real step. The German Foreign Minister calls the U.S. State Department\u2019s sanctions review process to be transparent as opposed to opaque. \u201cI certainly think Germany should be more assertive and say yes, this was not OK to begin with,\u201d Heiko Maas told parliament. \u201cThe European Union as a whole should clearly ask the United States what their plans are and what their policy is regarding Iran.\u201d Asked whether it was true that some of the sanctions against Iran took place due to pressure from Germany, Maas said, \u201cYes it certainly did.\u201d \u201cBut even Germany has been hit by these measures. There are also others that are not from the EU, from the United Nations, including even from France.\u201d Since Merkel\u2019s election as Chancellor, there has been a deepening rift in transatlantic relations. Both Angela Merkel and Barack Obama have tried in recent years to bring closer cooperation with the U.S. political system in order to ensure European stability. But Merkel\u2019s tough stance on matters ranging from climate change to foreign policy has alienated many U.S. Republican lawmakers and caused controversy within her own party. Barack Obama and Angela Merkel\u2019s relationship has become increasingly fractious in recent years.

However, a Defence Ministry spokesman told Reuters that the problem was experienced by the Army, navy and airforce, including aviation units.\nThe service members who are most in need of new hires include Army officers who have retired and are approaching retirement age, said the report. They represent the largest pool of service personnel that military recruiters must screen for work.\nThe German defence ministry told Reuters on Wednesday that it was still assessing whether the problem was just an issue of manpower or whether there was a lack of discipline among the personnel being evaluated.\nDespite the new report, there have been no new recruits through the state service system since October 2004, according to figures released by the defence ministry.\nThe ministry added that the workforce was being reduced, although it declined to elaborate on the issues behind the cuts.\nThe military workforce is comprised of soldiers and junior officers who perform administrative duties and provide technical expertise - particularly in electronics, logistics and combat planning - for the soldiers in active service.\n\"The problem in itself is not great, but it means that the military can have a hard time recruiting certain kinds of personnel, while other kinds of personnel with similar educational qualifications may find it difficult to move into active duty,\" Dornberger told Reuters.\nDefence ministry officials told Reuters they were \" not aware of any specific discipline complaints, such as theft or negligence.\"\nLast year, the German ministry cancelled an auction for the delivery of combat drones, a project it had won in 2004, because it found it was expensive and it could not compete, the ministry spokesman said.","token_len":378,"entropy":[8.4262,4.6963,9.4836,16.4821,2.7932,2.7251,8.6647,0.3521,3.3624,10.4107,0.4472,3.4468,1.5746,6.2063,0.0087,1.8942,3.151,0.4112,0.0236,2.0537,5.4819,0.9348,1.204,3.901,3.5421,1.8911,0.6615,6.1852,1.2469,2.9718,1.4962,1.8299,3.3675,5.53,7.0551,4.371,0.0222,3.3998,3.6696,3.3294,2.3268,0.3316,2.4543,1.672,0.0991,2.5212,0.3086,0.1988,14.0101,2.8265,5.5576,0.0662,4.3382,3.0733,3.3661,5.212,1.6153,6.3428,0.7661,9.1339,3.9085,1.1424,4.1163,0.0737,2.833,4.0471,0.2105,0.9103,2.4491,1.1351,1.1836,1.2143,3.6681,1.1505,6.7208,1.2331,2.2769,4.4894,0.7133,4.2698,0.2999,0.3011,5.6987,1.1549,5.2033,7.3777,3.937,0.6408,0.2102,3.107,5.6099,6.217,2.1165,2.367,4.9956,4.7017,0.1036,0.4527,2.8123,4.6615,3.1287,5.0691,1.8013,2.6306,1.4864,3.5028,1.8856,1.7626,8.1513,0.5624,0.8282,0.7145,2.6495,1.0159,1.2336,0.7478,4.7992,5.3322,3.2038,2.9912,3.5915,0.0814,2.8447,4.1386,4.5568,5.2371,4.5464,0.0228,3.8872,7.6137,0.7988,7.2928,2.1427,0.1429,1.5609,4.4438,4.1962,0.3766,5.4546,0.4482,2.8466,0.6047,0.2578,1.4826,1.6486,4.4332,2.5477,2.2419,1.5627,1.7413,0.9927,5.4864,2.5964,1.2509,0.4152,2.6397,4.1669,1.8085,2.8332,0.8627,0.782,2.6001,0.0052,5.4766,1.6108,0.9405,3.576,5.8988,4.7156,0.3141,0.3093,6.5091,0.8634,5.443,5.0864,0.2292,3.2059,2.6165,0.0736,1.4925,3.2842,3.7341,6.4715,0.6865,8.362,6.0199,4.1718,1.5321,4.1395,6.4664,0.5645,2.8161,0.0013,4.5528,1.7542,0.5975,0.3283,3.2614,0.0645,1.4607,0.568,1.7105,2.371,4.6878,0.2914,1.718,5.6658,2.2043,3.942,4.5137,3.3327,4.0609,1.1889,3.0459,0.0193,4.1369,0.9879,1.0178,6.5426,5.7245,0.2341,2.7342,0.1535,0.412,1.7931,3.1961,5.6742,1.391,5.6693,0.4135,4.5923,1.6886,7.657,0.2623,1.3245,5.4012,3.8574,2.3443,2.0475,3.1787,2.5146,5.2246,7.1883,5.144,1.6986,5.4235,1.5806,3.0893,0.3605,5.16,4.594,0.8849,2.0854,0.7876,6.4253,3.051,5.5867,2.0877,0.524,0.439,3.0259,1.4287,3.1485,3.8055,8.4432,0.4669,1.0402,6.0725,1.088,0.2713,1.5421,5.933,0.6278,1.5721,2.7788,4.1428,4.3096,1.5327,3.2066,0.0109,1.4338,6.3251,3.3082,0.0019,2.3356,2.4298,5.2284,3.9622,2.5187,0.5244,0.9191,6.3541,3.8998,6.6002,2.8099,3.4817,3.8493,1.0588,0.5499,0.5527,5.8197,2.1396,3.2144,2.0362,0.4128,6.7463,5.7309,3.7945,1.6312,1.0735,0.36,0.326,7.2417,0.0427,1.706,2.2827,3.547,0.1051,2.4154,1.2097,3.4248,9.7056,1.1631,0.3746,0.1746,3.3845,7.0731,5.7047,3.7141,4.7364,0.0065,8.1129,0.9752,6.2094,2.2756,0.4301,5.5411,1.4313,0.3295,1.209,2.1379,5.4284,8.009,2.8087,6.0299,1.4229,2.1283,7.2275,0.0304,5.7494,5.8774,2.0336,2.6572,3.6985,4.6431,1.0885,6.9075,2.2654,4.6086,1.8217,2.7344,1.632,2.9152,2.2806,1.602,5.0627,1.4821,4.918,2.1068,0.1578,4.4911,4.754,1.4166,1.2936,4.7479,0.3008,0.0775]}

U.S. President Donald Trump","text":"Iraq demanded on Thursday that the U.S. government backtrack on a decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad to protest the decision. U.S. President Donald Trump s move came as the Palestinian militants have intensified their attacks against the Israeli soldiers, which has caused several casualties. Israel on its side has also increased the intensity of the response and targeted several sites in the Gaza Strip and also in Syria which has resulted in several casualties. It has also imposed a curfew on the area due to fear among the Palestinian residents causing hardships and increasing poverty. In a statement issued by Iraqi Foreign Ministry, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari condemned the action of the Trump administration to decide the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital. He, however, expressed hope that Washington will reconsider their decision and come to a right decision. It should be noted that the American decision was preceded by the decision of the cabinet of the state of Qatar, which has confirmed a decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the Israeli. Hoshyar Zebari said: I asked my ambassador in Washington to express our grave concerns and demand from the American government to reconsider and come to the right decision. In addition, he highlighted the fact that Iran and Syria have expressed their support and solidarity for the Palestinians in the face of Israeli aggression and he referred to the statement of the Iranian Foreign Ministry that Jerusalem remains the capital of the Palestinian state. It is to highlight that the U.S. embassy had announced on Wednesday that Washington was going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced a series of decisions in this regard in which it has announced that it was moving its Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv citing a number of security benefits to the U.S. Embassy that Jerusalem has been considered security risks by Tel Aviv as much as the possibility of increasing terrorist attacks.","token_len":380,"entropy":[10.274,5.0378,2.7877,0.9941,1.595,3.125,0.002,0.2661,0.0539,2.3981,5.8959,2.7263,0.3964,2.6605,2.2307,0.6929,5.41,1.4017,0.17,0.6633,12.9915,1.852,2.0604,10.1057,1.4584,1.9476,0.0005,1.3212,0.0429,0.3498,1.9874,5.8905,0.6815,2.4934,1.6085,1.6746,0.2067,5.1583,0.0006,0.0287,0.0116,2.3327,1.0988,0.0069,9.2645,6.6161,3.1698,1.8106,1.9373,3.2133,5.4341,3.3536,4.1768,0.6038,0.8182,2.7544,1.9325,0.9422,6.5225,3.0101,2.9349,2.2179,4.1373,5.5374,3.5147,0.5337,3.3507,4.6501,6.7545,1.057,1.6408,2.518,6.1968,1.9548,3.5643,0.0706,2.3305,8.8886,2.8204,5.5693,4.4285,4.293,1.3652,0.8898,2.1792,0.0259,2.4427,5.4502,2.1156,4.6787,5.1641,3.2379,4.4269,0.0024,3.964,2.0739,0.3724,4.6792,1.6146,0.757,4.2667,1.271,2.8854,1.6728,1.4385,2.4802,6.5277,0.0032,4.9843,5.8983,2.3607,1.8339,3.1391,9.295,8.4118,2.4607,4.7732,7.0683,0.7338,3.9664,2.3098,1.0793,2.0409,1.8985,5.9421,2.7984,2.3687,2.1256,5.8509,0.3073,0.0151,3.6685,2.6616,0.0285,0.0018,0.0748,0.4074,0.0095,4.5939,0.3079,4.7326,2.317,0.5104,6.5473,0.1631,3.794,7.6149,3.1627,4.377,0.1464,0.0579,0.1293,0.3078,0.2685,0.0309,0.731,1.536,7.2264,1.1074,0.0396,3.7543,2.3836,0.1917,4.6814,1.0999,4.7756,4.5558,0.7067,1.9861,5.6864,0.5289,1.5275,9.1929,0.6736,1.6976,5.6408,4.6353,1.1832,0.649,0.1296,1.2423,4.9944,3.8667,1.9952,6.4071,0.1174,1.7414,2.9424,0.516,0.7589,6.977,1.2615,1.5916,6.2023,0.1717,2.5204,1.5312,0.4917,2.4532,6.4272,3.7738,1.8118,1.0762,0.2709,0.1492,0.1162,1.8203,0.2149,0.0945,2.0841,5.1755,7.8675,6.4215,1.2242,0.0216,0.0128,0.67,0.0024,0.0039,1.652,3.0238,5.7112,5.4496,3.1469,4.486,1.6943,2.5314,1.1437,3.2425,4.4473,5.5012,2.6872,2.0913,5.027,5.5822,0.6779,3.0901,1.0381,3.1078,2.3909,4.2818,2.8927,0.04,3.0013,0.1545,0.1326,0.5874,3.5859,3.488,0.4432,3.2037,7.6505,0.7275,2.1696,0.0249,5.4564,1.964,2.9173,1.1868,3.6145,1.0258,2.4128,2.753,2.5918,1.173,0.5731,2.6005,2.2124,1.0786,3.0327,0.0021,3.6354,1.039,1.4376,7.2427,5.6557,0.2875,0.8217,5.3213,0.8547,0.7282,3.4425,2.0855,1.471,2.8537,5.9744,5.2668,1.1513,0.1828,0.0395,1.0048,2.8322,0.9902,0.5016,3.7433,1.0936,5.0644,7.3326,0.944,1.2031,2.1471,0.0009,0.0196,0.057,5.9223,6.4911,5.2001,1.9965,2.7268,0.2878,3.9557,2.9959,3.4247,0.0987,2.3175,0.2356,0.0741,0.9187,0.1869,0.0384,1.1765,1.9036,5.789,2.7999,4.2111,0.0008,4.804,2.7914,3.684,0.194,3.6575,4.478,1.1872,1.9513,4.0971,1.4757,0.869,3.5294,4.1203,3.0502,4.5011,1.1487,0.9318,2.7355,2.0524,0.0104,11.0144,3.261,3.1602,0.0034,2.6803,8.9575,2.5083,0.749,1.9438,0.0007,0.0034,0.1011,1.3867,4.9423,6.751,2.7526,3.2602,5.9687,7.6126,8.8136,3.1275,8.7222,0.0089,4.1306,6.8193,0.0314,2.3109,4.7008,0.322,6.5652,4.5738,1.4273,2.0176]}

In addition, an investigation is ongoing against his cousin Omar al-Arifi, who is said to be a member of the armed wing of al-Masri s Al-Wakf Al-Islam party. Al-Arifi has been arrested several times in recent years on suspicion of links to the al-Qaeda in Iraq group and is an associate of Qatari Jaber al-Mujahid, the head of the al-Qaeda in Iraq.\nArab officials said they hoped the arrests of a number of senior Saudi officials in Riyadh would have an effect on the country s approach to the unrest in Egypt.\nA senior member of the kingdom s security council told the official Saudi Press Agency that the arrests of Saudi officials involved in the crackdown on the anti-Morsi protests could reduce the country s support for Morsi. The source suggested that the arrests, which took place on Saturday, were the result of the coordination between foreign governments, notably those of Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United States, in relation to the issue.","token_len":380,"entropy":[9.989,8.5071,4.2467,2.9858,0.0295,4.2487,0.1542,1.3724,10.1674,11.9572,8.0618,2.3303,4.8903,0.9418,8.0031,0.3207,6.6329,0.0254,2.212,2.3449,2.6065,3.101,3.9083,3.5316,3.4895,0.0086,10.2973,7.8831,1.3099,4.5339,0.1095,2.5661,3.7016,4.3101,1.6029,0.6656,1.5896,3.6582,5.4297,0.66,0.0902,0.2934,13.7019,5.1231,3.1822,0.1486,2.3341,0.0295,0.0224,0.0003,3.7377,6.2632,5.4127,0.8593,7.0797,5.5565,4.15,5.9252,3.3174,2.8148,4.9325,0.0975,0.2669,4.9639,4.4662,2.3518,0.0082,6.6209,1.8559,0.0767,0.6662,0.3822,5.2531,4.4503,1.9495,0.9524,4.2518,0.8278,4.9572,6.3719,1.0781,5.0878,0.1485,1.13,1.717,3.9145,0.4017,1.9451,0.4935,7.7759,2.248,1.6271,1.2125,0.0552,0.2777,6.4121,4.1654,4.8145,0.0006,5.7849,0.0211,0.3549,3.0111,1.2567,2.8248,2.0456,0.7517,5.0471,1.319,0.3489,4.1632,0.1604,0.0435,0.0003,1.7834,0.7995,1.842,2.9974,4.4405,0.0084,0.7909,6.6014,5.3655,3.4929,8.5982,1.6152,0.1804,2.2312,1.106,2.5337,2.2068,2.9121,2.4132,0.0293,0.3403,2.9883,1.0856,1.1993,2.829,5.566,1.8025,6.2579,3.4837,1.1599,0.511,2.0967,6.215,1.7463,0.3275,1.9525,2.5955,5.9308,0.1556,5.2265,1.7344,0.0255,0.8038,4.0047,2.0624,3.4198,0.271,1.562,4.1694,3.0161,1.0697,2.224,1.3924,1.6699,3.9374,4.9049,1.1767,4.7528,5.2778,3.6723,1.2497,4.1581,1.9881,2.1147,1.7587,4.0114,3.2182,3.2072,5.327,0.8886,0.0243,6.7438,5.0771,0.5387,0.8948,1.3343,4.0162,0.0208,0.6966,1.9344,2.146,0.003,0.724,4.3367,3.0617,0.1243,1.9269,0.2101,5.2232,0.0017,8.1263,5.6006,0.5276,3.9034,4.3808,3.2306,4.4096,0.0937,1.6763,5.3585,0.5761,5.0225,0.0156,0.3419,0.0054,2.4493,0.9624,2.5705,3.9359,0.0077,1.1666,1.5413,1.2576,3.8199,2.6657,0.0383,3.5523,0.1769,1.3616,3.0664,0.1108,0.9585,2.9775,2.5982,4.3469,2.0534,3.1868,5.2886,2.7084,0.0722,6.2154,0.9573,9.943,6.7395,0.2501,0.0357,3.7822,3.9467,1.8296,4.6769,1.6559,4.64,0.0209,0.718,1.9939,0.0647,0.5791,2.0448,0.3342,1.9484,0.3519,6.965,4.3863,1.788,2.7857,4.5571,1.7436,4.4097,2.5267,4.9328,1.1375,0.002,4.3978,3.8737,0.5548,2.8804,4.2163,0.6734,4.3105,2.4572,1.4586,0.2397,0.8681,3.796,4.9958,6.0089,0.4071,1.5404,5.8113,1.0303,1.1204,0.8941,0.5495,3.6984,2.5474,5.4063,0.0076,0.4066,4.9052,2.7708,3.6739,1.6371,3.3114,1.7938,5.3595,1.8844,2.1279,0.1173,0.6158,1.3841,2.0557,1.3309,5.2257,0.4978,5.1494,0.6173,0.5218,3.4754,1.2083,1.7565,5.7377,0.003,0.5039,0.0142,1.0064,3.7842,5.845,0.8914,2.9248,0.1865,3.7471,0.2927,1.9647,1.1794,3.2138,3.2687,5.3821,0.2905,1.1679,0.9689,4.3737,1.0411,2.7308,0.0048,2.1857,3.3551,0.5664,1.8589,3.0193,1.0976,0.009,2.0327,6.8099,0.8314,5.9283,3.702,2.3895,6.2512,3.6115,1.4401,4.7786,0.8615,4.0597,0.0227,0.318,1.6142,0.4264,1.1987,1.0139,2.5426,5.7494,0.009,0.6004,5.5459,1.8361]}

The ball rolled and he took it in, but a Colorado Rapids defender blocked his shot at the near post.","token_len":380,"entropy":[9.2935,0.7135,4.4407,3.0158,1.8237,0.3692,5.2907,0.8607,6.3621,4.3736,3.2127,2.889,0.939,7.9508,7.8324,1.7934,0.3009,6.7757,2.1422,0.2214,1.6008,3.697,5.6495,0.1614,0.194,2.1008,2.0175,2.1845,1.5771,4.1376,2.1587,0.1045,0.0955,2.5594,5.3453,3.4965,0.0098,6.7642,0.0001,0.5871,0.9463,0.0453,0.2575,2.7266,2.8098,3.7143,0.9652,4.2293,2.5117,1.2784,0.315,3.1178,6.9898,0.1041,0.0014,4.6499,11.8445,3.116,1.136,2.1724,0.3086,7.5897,1.8202,0.2956,0.3789,2.0456,1.6696,0.1293,3.8845,1.5823,0.4515,8.9858,2.991,2.564,2.9116,1.5846,1.1187,2.2759,0.0142,6.2454,0.5612,2.9954,6.232,0.0055,0.0466,1.1325,1.9042,12.1934,3.6877,2.1461,0.61,1.4238,4.7767,0.5272,1.0838,2.3351,1.631,6.2111,0.6792,0.6747,0.5738,1.23,0.5479,1.1998,1.3809,4.6556,0.9768,4.5629,3.5552,3.666,2.5714,4.4859,0.0437,3.0407,3.903,3.9174,2.0515,6.8919,3.5609,2.3961,3.5491,1.9333,1.8657,5.5276,3.5342,0.3098,4.2975,3.1269,2.0489,1.0444,6.5571,1.0078,1.9045,4.4388,5.5742,2.229,3.139,0.6082,1.6219,1.9627,0.8073,1.9063,0.0018,5.6438,0.6866,4.7304,4.0523,1.4893,0.7829,1.8147,2.4188,1.7546,7.6226,3.574,1.5375,0.0623,1.2311,2.5503,0.0016,1.8127,1.417,2.6338,1.1716,3.4771,0.2077,0.1179,5.5833,1.7519,0.2991,2.7455,2.4637,5.585,2.739,4.4688,0.0113,7.7319,5.8371,5.0651,0.0794,1.1456,2.043,1.7887,3.4077,1.0288,2.0376,2.2606,0.0179,4.1705,1.538,0.1244,1.659,2.8089,0.2467,1.1437,5.1836,0.1349,1.9676,2.0459,0.2724,3.8812,3.6632,3.4656,0.0046,0.4331,0.6898,4.4054,3.8473,2.6538,2.866,5.0792,0.0918,4.7984,2.3377,4.1483,0.4494,2.2712,9.7753,0.0456,7.2796,3.0425,5.412,7.9359,5.1559,3.6748,0.7353,6.7931,6.3959,2.2299,4.1324,0.6481,1.7298,7.7199,7.8616,3.7529,0.7279,7.7823,0.692,0.0062,0.0519,4.5509,0.1985,3.8568,2.6952,2.5767,8.7912,5.0713,5.3982,0.9355,1.0484,4.7065,0.2773,4.8633,4.3397,0.3001,2.7173,7.7771,3.5936,5.8164,2.2857,3.5024,2.1839,0.9452,2.4367,0.0158,0.0003,0.8297,0.046,0.0017,0.4898,4.3852,1.9968,4.0527,0.1732,3.1638,0.7604,1.99,2.7187,0.0092,2.626,0.4991,2.1263,2.7926,1.9998,1.4118,4.9852,0.0093,0.0004,0.0057,0.0214,0.1342,0.5666,1.1972,4.375,2.3634,7.0566,17.7518,6.3334,3.6974,1.7066,3.1996,1.5936,4.0881,0.0039,1.2261,0.9415,1.9642,1.7675,6.0511,7.956,9.5583,4.8739,2.5662,0.8541,2.4187,1.0111,0.4466,1.6806,5.5816,0.0334,0.005,8.6379,8.1035,2.4316,3.2034,3.6322,4.8514,1.2978,5.9145,2.7916,9.1886,2.7835,2.6812,1.3291,0.0033,1.1885,4.7181,0.591,5.5351,0.0273,0.4518,1.5434,0.2923,3.2317,3.8129,9.7731,5.7959,1.251,7.0308,5.6482,13.0474,3.065,6.5053,0.3504,0.8383,2.6441,0.0238,4.8387,2.0358,1.4048,5.2877,4.2688,4.6998,4.4095,1.6103,3.4529,2.6138,1.5303,4.1331,3.0797,0.0159,0.3212,3.6187,3.1684,0.3218,5.4466,0.3407,1.2898,0.0269,0.5449]}

Bush in 2004 that big U.S. bank mergers were \u201c totally out of control \u201d and should be stopped as they were forcing businesses to borrow money at lower interest rates at the expense of the American taxpayer. While the Trump administration was \u201c not an outlawing of bank mergers \u201d during the Bush years, it was a warning that the \u201c system was collapsing. \u201d\nThe banking system, as a whole, will soon be under public control, if the Democrats take control of Congress when the November election is held. The current government-run banks are already losing money because of a crisis that would never have occurred if the country had its own bank system from the beginning.\nA new American Bank Act, which will be enacted upon Congressional passage, will give the Secretary of the Treasury ultimate power to establish any bank or branch network needed to \u201c meet any national need or interest \u201c whether it was the need of a single family, a large commercial firm, or a multinational corporation. This would have the same authority that the president has with regard to the U.S. Postal Service. It would put the country in control of the biggest private sector industry in America.\nIn fact, the public will be allowed to create their own new bank with the aid of some of the largest private investment groups, both domestic and foreign.\nCongress would also pass the bill to prohibit state bankruptcy laws. State laws that would allow a distressed bankrupt enterprise to file a petition for reorganization (bankruptcy) and sell its assets to its creditors without any court oversight would be declared unconstitutional. It would be up to federal courts to decide if a bankruptcy was fair and just. This is the same law that was passed in America in 1841 in order to put bankruptcies under federal control and prevent them from affecting businesses.","token_len":380,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,7.2509,2.7863,6.2351,2.5087,10.8014,0.279,0.0109,0.0055,4.4944,3.9142,0.5609,8.6195,5.3606,0.0032,0.0054,0.0251,6.0312,6.6124,0.0006,2.2165,17.5987,6.4648,8.8023,2.7826,0.0826,1.2355,4.0584,7.7879,0.7863,4.8083,0.4516,1.0944,4.6036,5.6149,1.718,8.0764,5.6841,0.5059,6.1318,1.4121,3.6488,3.3941,0.3616,0.019,6.0068,1.0781,1.1485,0.0034,2.0989,1.4498,2.7482,0.2064,5.1843,1.8479,3.9185,0.1471,3.8155,11.3571,0.3796,4.117,5.6427,7.868,3.7619,0.7502,4.837,0.077,0.0004,2.2659,1.1447,7.2574,0.8146,1.4342,1.4841,0.3877,1.4364,1.2039,2.4123,3.2738,1.7037,1.7535,9.678,1.135,5.1342,1.1494,4.4029,1.2209,5.0842,1.9969,1.0215,10.1107,6.6513,1.347,3.4,2.3309,2.2346,0.3644,0.1262,5.2493,2.6216,1.3331,3.6789,6.675,1.9998,1.9285,4.4293,2.7024,5.4542,4.4917,1.6029,0.2888,0.5189,6.8366,1.5086,4.0341,1.0836,0.9346,2.1999,0.6244,2.0572,4.8397,3.9223,4.1234,1.7577,3.2462,1.4793,3.2097,5.1533,1.4608,3.3393,0.9444,3.1547,4.7711,2.1134,4.9272,5.8794,0.6589,1.1957,0.9792,1.0747,4.1034,0.742,7.0525,0.577,3.1481,1.5647,7.7075,0.9231,1.1048,0.3693,1.5466,4.7126,3.1676,4.6546,2.8532,4.864,2.2206,2.1024,2.3629,2.7491,3.4236,6.4618,8.8576,1.4968,0.9134,1.2506,3.9177,1.1308,5.9162,0.0783,0.4487,0.0586,8.0072,1.9155,0.3888,4.9379,4.6633,1.9787,3.2904,6.0782,7.6137,6.862,0.2933,11.6475,0.2007,5.8088,3.5556,3.4778,4.6034,3.0237,5.317,2.0377,1.4086,6.3873,1.2143,3.9223,3.2121,4.0358,1.3253,1.8756,5.0119,3.6294,1.8762,1.2051,3.0144,4.7945,5.2057,0.6309,0.4392,0.5825,5.2763,1.3418,0.4255,2.2994,3.1263,4.6839,1.6757,3.5065,6.5156,3.4486,1.3019,4.4718,1.5678,3.7163,1.6427,0.0015,1.4236,4.0592,0.0008,0.006,0.0302,1.9221,0.0253,1.3083,3.0307,0.9469,5.6389,1.1316,5.179,1.5918,3.0976,0.1225,1.1328,5.772,4.5039,2.9421,5.9719,0.2021,3.2462,1.1835,1.1376,3.2107,3.4286,0.0365,1.2217,5.2468,2.6809,1.4395,3.932,0.1249,4.3809,1.7637,0.0039,4.4045,1.758,4.363,0.987,5.6902,0.0664,5.1742,1.9258,0.2629,2.5814,1.364,4.5109,3.3307,2.9925,5.6562,3.764,0.0232,0.5502,0.4404,2.285,5.1928,3.7749,2.1399,5.1725,1.8746,4.6666,2.0814,5.3872,6.4825,7.448,1.3349,2.0832,4.9804,2.8952,2.7126,3.0974,2.3541,2.8409,7.5817,4.7127,9.0875,0.1327,3.2984,2.4594,5.1933,1.0388,4.5604,0.0081,4.4033,6.6881,0.3498,0.0117,0.332,3.121,4.7913,1.9336,0.5596,1.0107,4.0189,0.5196,4.0525,2.9548,3.7611,3.5524,3.3535,0.8274,5.7669,0.2813,0.579,4.2444,0.7453,1.8599,2.2803,0.0188,4.6997,0.9292,0.1407,0.8132,2.5792,1.6412,1.4743,3.3281,6.3094,1.3628,2.6156,0.9801,3.1503,2.3608,2.0457,2.7141,3.0688,0.4456,2.5344,1.3314,1.0174,6.3674,1.3271,3.0669,4.7765,3.0142,2.1905,0.039,4.9429,5.3269,1.9997,1.5555,3.1645,1.318,3.2631,2.5624,1.9862,0.1334,4.4675,4.9119,1.3692]}

the dissolution of the main opposition party and imprisonment of its leaders.\n\"This announcement marks an important step forward and a statement of support towards an independent and prosperous Cambodia, free from oppression and violence,\" said State Department Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland in a statement issued in Washington.\nBut she said the United States remained concerned over the government's failure to provide its people with basic services and the stalled reform process.\n\"Over the past decade, the military dictatorship in Cambodia has led to violations of human rights, including the dissolution of the main opposition party, incarceration of civilians and the military s refusal to investigate acts of violence against protesters,\" Nuland added.\nThe announcement comes one week after the United States released a human rights report that condemns Cambodian government policies in the name of fighting impunity as \"completely unacceptable and immoral\".\nAmnesty International said on Wednesday the decision was \"a significant setback\" for Cambodia s political process and that all political parties need to accept and address \"their respective duties and responsibilities in any future political negotiations\".\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry and his Cambodian counterpart said the move would create a more peaceful environment.\n\"I appreciate that the Cambodian Foreign Ministry has taken action that will help ease tensions,\" said Kerry, who visited Cambodia on Tuesday.\n\"We will continue to support the people of Cambodia as they work toward a better future and a prosperous Cambodia.\"\nThe announcement comes ahead of a visit to Cambodia by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Thursday, who also

{"prompt":"Britain s rejection of a transgender woman s claim for a women s state pension because she was still married to her spouse from before her transition is discriminatory , an EU court adviser said","text":"Britain s rejection of a transgender woman s claim for a women s state pension because she was still married to her spouse from before her transition is discriminatory, an EU court adviser said Tuesday. Ms Eleni Paravadivelou, the court s executive secretary, said the legal challenge, filed by Ms Sarah Read, a married nurse, had \" nothing to do with gender equality \". A high court judge rejected Ms Read s claim for her pension in July. The case prompted calls in Britain for the country to change its laws. Ms Read s husband, Mr James Read, asked a court to grant him a divorce on the grounds that he had only known his wife for five years while she was transitioning into the sex assigned to her at birth. She told a London tribunal that she had been denied housing benefits because of the divorce, and that she had faced harassment in the workplace. Mr Read disputed her claims, saying she had asked for a divorce only to get more money in benefits, and that she should not have been denied housing if she stayed married to him. Ms Read s legal team argued discrimination had been taken into account, as Ms Read was only entitled to a five-year entitlement to a retirement pension instead of life expectancy. The case would have reached its end if the Court of Justice had agreed. EU rules say pensions can be awarded to spouses, partner or friends who have spent five years in a stable relationship with the beneficiary.

Turkey has been angered by U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters who have so far fought back effectively against the Islamic State. \"I want to say something to our Kurdish brothers,\" Erdogan told reporters in a speech. \"We will soon completely destroy those who are linked to the terrorist organization.\"\nThe U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that the U.S. would continue to provide assistance to Kurdish fighters as it fights to protect civilians, a day after the U.S. sent in planes to help Kurds fight Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. is providing aid primarily to the YPG, a pro-U.S. Syrian Kurdish militant group that says it seeks an independent state. The U.S. said Tuesday it would continue to supply Kurdish fighters, but that it would limit the help given to other pro-government militias in Syria and is also planning to send in planes to help their fighting. \"I am very pleased to see the resurgence of the YPG against Islamic State,\" State Department spokes person Victoria Nuland said. \"We provide assistance, both humanitarian support to make sure that the YPG can defend themselves, and also assistance to military assistance for them to be able to fight against Islamic State. \"We want to minimize any collateral damage. Obviously as you can imagine these are very hard decisions.\" A YPG spokesman, said the group supported Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan's drive to retake territories that have been captured by the Islamic State. \"That will not happen in the near future,\" said YPG spokesman Abdullah \u00d6calan in a phone interview. The YPG has been fighting with U.S.-led airstrikes and other American-led efforts in Iraq and Syria to repel the Islamic State, a terror group that carried out attacks in Europe and the Middle East.","token_len":382,"entropy":[11.4453,0.5245,3.2819,1.5438,2.2842,0.6081,1.5767,2.5661,9.4787,0.8462,9.4054,3.7094,6.1362,4.8418,2.095,6.2856,0.108,6.9501,1.5576,0.9424,4.6197,1.3792,1.7869,6.8022,0.279,4.8645,0.0003,0.0341,0.3079,3.3295,0.197,2.0538,2.118,4.9431,0.6975,1.7848,0.7482,5.9944,0.0047,3.1011,4.0625,6.4673,0.3541,1.2783,1.6266,0.0034,1.9712,4.5342,2.8398,3.104,0.4419,2.2952,3.8709,1.7078,3.5496,3.7819,1.7361,3.1246,0.1847,1.3493,0.8073,1.487,3.8148,2.891,1.9887,0.6342,1.4155,1.149,5.0385,2.1096,0.1031,0.3904,2.2912,1.1927,2.4933,0.2464,1.1465,3.3226,1.8982,1.5309,0.9246,9.8466,2.4081,0.0006,0.0273,0.3502,2.3258,0.0038,1.4737,1.4557,0.5321,0.269,2.0794,1.7298,0.0003,0.0136,0.1273,2.5538,2.5233,0.4272,2.7411,3.0297,0.2453,1.872,1.4597,3.7631,3.0523,3.7976,1.7056,3.7929,1.8418,2.9988,4.5071,5.6751,0.0953,1.8301,1.3357,0.0005,0.0189,0.1848,4.4308,4.1169,6.3372,0.6879,1.5198,4.4579,2.4444,1.662,0.0063,2.6805,0.8065,0.2655,1.9506,1.3996,0.0005,0.0047,0.0683,2.9467,2.3874,4.3743,5.7447,0.2818,1.5548,1.6339,0.6673,1.7439,4.762,0.0042,4.148,0.0005,0.0141,0.0518,4.3559,0.2627,3.5655,0.2411,1.6435,6.5056,0.2203,4.2454,3.8964,0.736,0.8904,1.2301,1.9153,1.2433,0.0005,0.0055,0.0702,2.9507,3.8836,1.3573,1.8042,2.0602,0.3703,3.3906,1.8952,0.5352,2.9755,1.8539,2.9088,1.0883,0.8197,7.3613,1.7809,5.6636,3.2145,0.3484,3.4928,5.4025,0.0024,2.2844,2.8399,2.4378,1.1507,3.067,6.3334,3.5698,4.618,0.3064,2.2792,1.9178,4.5374,0.7498,1.033,5.7428,4.3891,1.5964,3.0847,3.2977,2.2949,1.8903,2.5794,1.4233,1.9152,1.5258,8.7412,0.1763,0.7822,1.3708,5.48,2.4246,0.0081,1.6882,5.2691,5.9609,7.1086,8.9898,4.6156,0.0202,0.0029,0.0003,0.4926,1.2912,0.9679,1.3811,6.1554,2.9921,3.0715,4.9743,3.7101,5.2627,2.9721,7.9052,0.2679,0.8715,1.4976,1.5369,2.6805,2.9439,2.079,2.092,0.3588,2.2675,4.2529,0.5433,6.9177,3.6065,2.7758,4.554,1.4644,4.5061,0.5688,0.0069,1.9371,2.021,1.3279,0.0026,2.9963,2.4339,1.2363,3.8758,0.2862,6.9424,1.8912,4.6097,0.1032,3.4189,6.8794,5.71,3.3881,1.8169,0.6822,5.1129,1.5677,1.474,3.2384,2.3962,2.5719,3.8465,4.6055,0.6777,2.3928,6.5494,1.6189,0.9633,6.0154,4.0395,4.8062,0.1305,0.0195,0.1108,1.0393,6.289,0.5059,5.0449,7.5867,3.0032,2.6213,0.1581,2.6162,0.1645,1.0881,0.866,0.0023,0.7805,0.8798,5.271,4.0994,1.4268,1.4683,2.3106,1.6439,1.7214,0.0665,0.7755,1.5231,4.8358,0.347,4.7155,4.2438,0.1147,0.0019,3.7885,0.5896,4.1009,0.2185,0.5875,2.5768,1.3318,1.833,1.1527,0.8985,3.5139,2.8975,0.0002,0.0057,0.3676,1.043,2.6581,2.8591,3.3487,4.5274,2.0435,0.4919,2.5958,1.8355,2.2211,0.3669,0.0653,2.5737,4.2965,0.0447,0.7926,0.5201,0.0012,1.8394,3.1578,6.0741,0.152,0.7735,7.6266,0.0027,2.5333,0.6867,3.6265,0.5548,1.2804,1.6487,0.0065,1.0959]}

Several thousand","text":"Poland s new prime minister said on Thursday he expected the European Commission to launch an unprecedented punishment procedure against Warsaw next week after months of wrangling over the rule of law. Several thousand people staged demonstrations across Poland on Wednesday on its last day in office by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has sought to end years of political instability and has had to work to preserve the ruling PiS Party to hold off a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Donald Tusk on Thursday said he was pleased with Britain's decision to maintain sanctions against the Ukrainian government that he described as \"very strong\". The PiS, which was unopposed in the general election last September, will retain a parliamentary majority of almost a third. The party has been accused of authoritarian tactics. The next general election will be called after the PiS's term ends. Tusk said that next year, Poland will be ready to join the European Union. However, he said the party would not agree to any changes that were part of the political deal that brought the country to the EU's shores. EU leaders and Poland reached an agreement on the terms for a temporary extension to EU membership after Poland pledged to make major reforms to the country's system of justice, free speech and its economy. EU leaders were expected to decide on the deal this month, but Britain, France and the Baltic states voted to maintain sanctions. A deal would have allowed European Parliament votes on Poland's membership to begin last week. Instead, such talks have been delayed as Brussels and Warsaw seek time to implement reforms. \"I am fully confident that we will get an extension in June,\" Tusk told reporters on Thursday. EU leaders will meet on May 26 in Barcelona. Tusk, who led Poland as president in 2003-2004, was seen as the likeliest candidate to succeed Charles Michel in the European Council presidency starting on June 1, after Michel is re-elected.","token_len":382,"entropy":[6.4617,9.0524,8.7933,4.9416,0.0299,4.4715,2.1768,2.1601,2.1159,4.9034,1.5797,3.1749,2.0696,0.3099,4.612,1.3427,6.2835,9.0483,8.5639,1.9784,6.727,5.2194,0.644,3.3754,5.8443,0.013,3.6888,0.0071,0.3801,1.1918,5.8556,0.119,0.0027,0.6827,9.7156,6.4443,2.0549,5.3314,2.8305,2.5306,1.5585,1.8332,1.442,5.5403,5.4406,7.7453,0.2391,1.7478,1.3793,6.651,9.7327,0.0024,2.0501,0.0037,0.0001,1.49,1.1613,1.8137,4.3472,0.2762,3.9694,3.3788,0.006,2.5737,4.6095,2.0011,5.355,5.7375,1.1046,6.0738,2.6026,4.5038,1.6024,5.5482,4.5902,0.002,4.9679,5.2785,3.894,4.1807,1.0717,8.3645,0.1354,0.008,0.8277,2.4274,4.0582,0.5573,10.4257,0.082,0.0005,4.4849,0.6745,1.6031,0.9397,3.6954,5.5897,1.2017,7.7817,0.0696,0.8004,0.3363,6.8259,4.4614,1.2689,2.1846,6.259,0.9803,4.1592,2.5857,2.5057,0.0503,0.9223,3.5328,3.3309,0.9892,2.5915,6.7491,0.0038,2.1154,0.7851,3.3109,7.0685,1.5684,0.0001,0.8484,0.9978,4.9453,0.1356,2.2212,3.9597,0.2086,3.8044,6.0234,3.0013,2.6403,0.2965,2.5334,6.1881,4.358,1.0831,2.837,2.1039,4.8069,1.5958,1.7759,2.6031,0.1743,7.6762,3.3009,3.5976,2.1156,5.9114,4.5107,0.0909,1.9969,0.4182,3.7758,4.2009,0.9851,4.4606,0.0026,2.5256,6.5543,0.8572,2.3378,3.955,0.001,1.115,2.5816,7.2187,1.7354,2.5301,2.4154,1.7939,2.2237,3.5552,0.3426,4.1036,0.5745,1.2377,0.085,1.4137,4.4616,0.0918,0.8938,1.1189,1.9597,5.1665,1.3875,1.1163,4.3904,0.1075,2.7729,3.3134,3.7741,3.8068,4.7179,0.0072,0.9437,5.4502,3.7115,2.5026,4.4737,1.2472,2.5972,0.9316,0.4066,1.1985,2.8793,6.0069,0.6953,4.6628,1.4364,4.0143,4.2834,10.586,0.4371,0.6728,1.372,1.8902,3.7059,4.5899,1.7078,5.1142,5.0621,2.4915,4.3451,0.9029,4.0967,3.5784,6.5892,0.3398,4.9515,6.5543,1.2602,1.6134,1.7432,1.6844,0.0551,4.1459,0.3616,4.0987,1.9416,4.2525,1.9665,0.2217,5.5452,3.0538,0.4034,3.8033,1.1855,3.5304,2.4966,0.0848,4.2189,0.8826,1.4537,4.5965,3.6445,2.1172,1.6647,1.0976,5.6343,2.834,1.6607,0.5276,2.0031,6.4153,0.3254,5.6531,2.3626,5.1128,1.0009,1.466,3.6509,3.4846,3.4921,2.0732,2.2928,5.5162,6.0986,3.1868,0.6729,4.4829,0.0582,3.1644,4.184,4.6828,6.1709,1.4978,0.6562,7.1536,0.1653,7.0493,4.2695,1.7883,1.1406,2.2712,3.7105,4.95,3.1836,1.6918,2.7504,7.8636,0.2194,5.2683,3.5632,1.02,3.8249,2.7272,1.5307,5.3169,1.4196,0.3862,1.6704,0.5367,2.9338,3.5569,3.5787,2.6247,5.4988,1.1558,0.6746,0.0002,0.834,0.8978,2.6874,0.4402,0.4249,4.0245,0.7321,2.6562,1.7316,1.3239,3.4469,3.5301,1.6725,8.2422,2.231,2.9616,0.0015,3.0252,0.4841,3.9675,2.4464,4.8106,2.7641,0.9504,3.8362,2.239,2.5519,0.2854,3.2803,3.9539,0.4465,2.2165,11.1605,0.0059,0.8048,0.5668,1.9925,6.5964,3.2258,2.6486,1.2409,1.8023,2.6996,1.4428,7.7514,1.7326,1.9789,2.9076,2.089,3.4172,2.5251,6.4245,5.4088,0.4526,0.0152,1.7026]}

A British parliamentarian was interviewed Sunday on Sky News to discuss the final Brexit agreement and said that even though it is late, there was no reason to fear that the deal was politically impossible to push through.\nOn Tuesday, a leading European official said there were questions over the government s ability to push through Brexit legislation without the UK parliament approval as soon as Oct 3, a date the United Kingdom has already chosen.\nA government source said: \u201cThe British proposal has not been put to the test yet, but we think it cannot go through.\u201d\nThe government and EU struck a deal to end the EU s three-year divorce process on Sunday, but the deal could not pass through the House of Commons before Oct 3 if the U.K. was to leave the European Union at that point.\nThere was no vote Monday on the U.K. s agreement to end post-Brexit ties. Although Conservative lawmakers voted as intended to support the agreement, lawmakers from both the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties held up the agreement. Both parties also have plans to hold elections in their own constituencies this month, making it unlikely that they will join together to vote for the deal.\nThe government said last week that it intended to push through the package on Oct 3 in spite of the fact that it would not go to Parliament and face the vote necessary to pass the legislation.\nThe prime minister also vowed last week to move Brexit legislation ahead in secret. The minister responsible for Brexit, Oliver Robbins, said the government expects the legislation to move quickly in a \u201csecretive\u201d debate in Parliament.","token_len":383,"entropy":[9.8128,5.931,2.8832,0.0176,1.6223,2.3499,2.2129,0.5825,1.7706,4.3333,2.363,3.268,2.3846,11.5924,12.3621,6.0438,0.0014,26.7093,19.5448,14.603,3.5674,6.9292,1.3829,4.7028,0.009,8.6606,1.0319,10.5565,4.4505,3.6791,2.0268,0.0269,0.4104,0.3436,2.6589,5.7353,9.5455,8.6108,6.5021,0.3862,0.2022,17.132,8.8751,3.6387,5.0566,8.0684,1.8673,4.6482,3.7337,5.4845,3.1153,2.5926,2.8182,0.1355,4.4892,0.9685,1.6287,1.6004,6.0909,3.4374,4.5003,0.3605,4.0309,5.41,7.7968,1.2819,4.115,0.318,4.4,1.237,0.7788,5.5016,3.398,3.796,2.9888,2.4133,1.5705,5.0782,1.7464,2.6092,1.776,5.9783,1.0102,2.8249,1.8798,1.5166,3.8701,0.737,4.2916,1.734,1.4538,3.0462,2.9921,8.0973,1.7597,3.2466,5.2156,0.4611,0.6016,0.2585,4.5317,1.1696,1.0014,2.9266,4.8275,3.604,3.7619,0.9921,3.4403,2.0082,6.2472,2.3712,1.0966,4.564,3.5612,5.3906,0.0171,4.2338,0.5765,4.0633,3.2288,3.4236,2.0209,2.8526,5.2607,8.6664,4.7597,4.1656,0.0045,8.3809,5.0837,1.7821,3.4637,1.9216,2.7156,5.7442,0.2716,1.6911,3.0876,5.7694,1.3584,0.4418,3.9685,3.6392,1.672,0.6516,2.3004,12.144,6.1473,3.149,3.3333,8.5648,2.9858,2.7042,0.4149,3.2362,1.3034,1.3703,4.1506,2.1385,1.598,0.6756,2.028,4.1722,1.0221,7.9059,3.7412,1.9944,1.9572,4.9611,7.5162,1.0516,1.7837,2.0606,5.0577,3.1105,9.2577,0.3311,0.8669,2.2996,3.1897,0.7213,3.7036,8.0461,5.1403,0.399,0.1798,2.0829,1.6318,1.7227,2.9752,1.3881,2.9177,1.8245,4.1132,3.8484,1.7558,4.2113,3.0324,1.3339,2.7308,0.0463,0.2698,3.3599,1.7867,0.8599,3.2558,1.2776,4.6111,0.0267,0.0354,0.1453,4.524,1.6127,2.4248,0.3086,1.5917,0.0287,4.4924,1.0127,1.5642,0.2784,0.4666,4.5398,1.6848,1.3112,5.1036,6.788,0.9227,0.9395,3.9348,0.0016,0.0265,0.527,2.4841,3.817,1.9131,2.3217,8.2056,0.0227,0.121,5.2911,1.8354,6.2323,6.879,4.6151,2.7549,6.3665,6.0398,0.7369,4.5444,0.8596,2.9875,0.5136,6.3833,2.983,1.7683,2.4219,3.5575,1.1128,0.4212,2.1812,0.1754,5.5901,3.4372,0.6346,1.743,2.0028,5.7228,0.8262,3.8277,3.9477,4.8001,0.22,2.8892,4.8279,1.5906,5.5264,2.0232,1.6001,3.5033,3.1117,2.3888,4.7228,0.8475,1.7869,0.8014,2.3185,0.4278,5.0689,4.5869,1.4208,2.9703,1.3118,0.9957,1.6755,0.3286,0.2696,1.656,2.3806,2.8895,4.2938,0.1412,0.3561,0.8856,4.8974,0.0631,3.6778,0.6014,0.5018,5.006,3.242,1.3226,0.3958,3.7895,4.7353,0.014,1.4557,3.6317,0.0699,1.9891,2.7256,1.8533,3.9734,3.2778,4.219,3.6666,6.4476,2.5049,4.1994,7.0116,0.2511,1.8987,1.0977,1.5751,0.3616,0.6138,1.5585,3.2334,0.0112,2.8423,5.6378,5.0253,0.1345,1.1742,4.227,3.8198,1.1138,4.5324,4.6919,7.0659,2.1496,2.3916,4.47,6.8111,0.0248,1.6105,1.6045,8.3144,2.1579,0.1271,0.7149,2.5421,0.7669,5.8944,1.4642,3.1411,0.4429,4.8596,3.5805,3.6796,3.1576,15.2604,2.4023,7.3122,6.282,1.5525,2.8722,6.7784,3.4405,1.7278,1.2143]}

She said the United States government can assist the Japanese government in providing financial aid to poor girls and young women with dream careers.\n\u2018 We really don\u2019t have to spend 100 million dollars to give a girl the opportunity to go to school,\u2019 Ivanka said. \u2018 In fact if you make 10 million dollars you\u2019ve given her an opportunity that 10 million other people couldn\u2019t get.\u2019\nAt the APEC summit in Singapore in November, Trump promised to increase U.S. support for women across the globe.","token_len":383,"entropy":[8.7641,0.1682,2.1776,6.2214,0.0225,0.0999,0.143,1.341,0.7834,0.0164,12.0941,9.9567,8.6022,2.4826,3.0588,12.1829,0.2417,2.4777,5.9059,2.5689,7.5546,1.1143,4.741,0.5414,2.0167,0.426,1.9246,4.2819,3.7031,8.1444,4.8836,4.332,5.492,4.5082,0.4391,1.0298,8.0172,0.0734,2.149,0.6324,0.223,1.1042,0.8413,16.5891,4.8139,6.7266,2.8671,0.7791,6.084,4.9395,2.7817,0.8169,4.0232,0.291,3.8006,0.641,0.4295,1.6623,8.4458,3.805,1.504,1.9622,4.3056,3.89,1.977,2.6727,3.2857,1.9396,0.2577,3.759,0.819,0.0045,0.2146,0.0123,1.312,9.8644,0.0046,0.7877,0.3303,1.2071,0.3524,1.79,0.0941,2.8909,3.2913,6.863,4.3643,0.1725,1.0969,1.2255,1.4986,0.6593,5.6492,0.4907,1.9594,0.3038,1.9188,1.2983,0.1009,3.7897,1.6624,0.7659,3.4722,0.0788,1.0372,0.8555,5.284,0.051,5.0666,3.3647,3.5615,4.554,0.5025,7.157,1.0591,5.9251,6.3129,0.1389,3.9797,4.7725,1.5745,3.6172,4.3749,0.356,0.324,4.3573,0.2881,2.5163,2.497,3.2372,4.4469,0.635,3.9008,1.4075,0.3606,7.0714,0.0015,2.8606,3.5548,1.4387,3.0067,2.9559,0.5214,3.22,1.507,7.8749,1.5834,6.1996,2.6223,5.121,2.7788,1.6829,5.8645,0.1854,3.5012,1.7418,0.4093,1.6578,0.0695,7.1642,2.5576,1.0454,3.4128,2.2458,2.9827,5.0003,2.3485,0.6818,0.0603,0.3988,0.2005,0.2111,0.578,0.0371,4.9979,5.5712,0.7967,1.1887,2.9645,1.3442,2.595,1.8512,3.9976,1.8975,4.4205,3.7821,2.8204,4.4048,5.9068,2.566,3.423,6.0193,4.9529,2.2,6.4561,1.0009,5.8031,0.9565,4.27,2.0101,1.0128,0.7427,3.4018,1.221,2.6251,1.961,3.5916,0.0353,1.8815,3.7027,0.3391,0.288,2.4777,0.0036,2.3471,0.4064,1.7254,3.5604,1.3695,5.0877,1.1882,7.2227,3.7241,0.0647,0.7941,2.544,4.7714,5.5395,4.2452,0.0195,2.5735,1.8066,7.5406,4.3098,3.0273,4.7908,2.6231,5.9154,2.0356,6.0165,0.7507,2.1201,0.168,0.1106,4.2207,0.0012,6.5951,7.4166,0.5647,5.0985,2.3609,6.2809,0.7614,5.1435,4.2228,2.3932,4.1683,1.8265,4.7593,0.2117,4.9728,4.7632,0.0005,6.955,1.2355,3.2961,2.02,3.5966,0.4555,2.6879,0.984,2.0933,2.0235,0.0972,5.6961,5.0605,5.1614,3.5882,5.9889,0.4875,1.1743,3.6719,3.5903,1.2322,0.5504,5.0888,1.5602,2.3642,2.911,0.186,4.1398,8.2845,3.3444,0.9399,0.2112,1.6686,0.0242,1.7231,5.7897,3.9095,0.6249,0.7309,0.0203,0.8406,0.2556,6.9849,6.445,2.8118,0.2149,1.6939,4.1321,2.8422,1.5797,2.3922,1.3872,0.4846,0.7584,0.3047,2.1796,1.6547,0.3044,0.0207,1.3667,0.2155,0.0895,0.4954,0.019,4.6226,1.4894,4.3313,1.3053,5.1913,5.8413,0.6402,0.1904,3.2353,7.9388,0.3642,9.3018,6.4956,2.751,3.1627,0.2718,3.3214,7.7054,0.1728,5.7332,1.8686,5.1845,0.5139,0.8382,0.0561,2.4478,1.0502,0.9215,0.0649,0.1238,5.5215,0.4738,2.0076,0.0007,1.0392,2.4272,5.3978,5.0823,3.4531,0.0923,2.0829,3.7169,0.4332,3.5124,2.2127,0.0005,0.0021,0.0152,3.6607,0.1745,0.863,6.2692,0.4789,1.2025,0.7129]}

{"prompt":"President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is long overdue . I think it s long overdue . Many presidents have said they want to do","text":"President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is long overdue. I think it s long overdue. Many presidents have said they want to do this and for many years, it just sort of stopped there, he told the Jewish community at a rally in the East Rutherford, New Jersey suburb of New York. But now the time is overdue. President Trump\u2019s comments came less than a day after he declared Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital.\nThe president also suggested the Jewish state could move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem within weeks. The declaration he made Monday on Monday means that the U.S. is officially breaking diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority led by Hamas and acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. The declaration is part of a plan that Trump announced last November called the \u201c Road Map for a Two-State Solution\u201d, which includes a solution for Palestinians in that a Palestinian state would be recognized, but only when the Palestinians give up rights under the 1967 Six Day War, also called a series of wars.\nIn the future, every year that goes by, the Palestinian Authority gives a percentage of resources that were the tax receipts of illegal settlements away to the Jewish people instead of keeping them for itself, Mr. Trump told the crowd. The U.N., which has criticized Trump for the declaration of Jerusalem, told the White house that the U.S. does not have the power to decide on the status of Jerusalem. In announcing the recognition Trump said he had received more than 20 phone calls from foreign leaders calling on him not to do that, but he had no such support or pressure from Israel or the Palestinians. Speaking to the crowd, Trump told them he had been wrong to criticize the city in the past, and that he had always been supportive of peace in Jerusalem, but this time is different.","token_len":383,"entropy":[7.0261,0.1398,3.4669,1.8901,2.3679,4.6773,3.769,0.3006,4.4002,0.1257,0.0292,0.4426,0.0284,0.0336,0.056,2.1025,7.5858,0.022,0.4654,9.2966,2.6216,1.0718,11.2218,4.5392,0.0175,1.7782,6.3048,5.6257,0.9927,2.0219,1.8797,1.776,0.4241,2.684,1.8035,2.8051,5.4095,2.1998,1.5399,2.2079,2.7171,5.4548,6.345,0.0075,5.1904,3.7719,2.5729,7.0519,5.1888,1.7984,2.9372,1.7056,4.0325,1.857,2.3063,0.8174,4.3857,2.976,6.0075,0.4662,0.7204,0.0495,3.3847,0.4149,3.1107,1.4554,1.0477,2.6287,3.1771,3.2046,4.1204,1.2741,8.0541,1.0684,4.622,0.245,12.0974,8.1721,2.5574,6.6223,4.2989,3.8082,0.0042,0.9509,2.2735,0.1483,1.3679,4.2777,1.2156,3.8158,0.024,1.3977,3.029,0.1402,0.0643,0.036,0.6848,1.3461,8.4426,2.1001,2.7363,5.3729,2.4757,4.3917,1.3544,2.9302,3.4615,4.2543,0.6419,0.0005,0.0141,0.0411,0.6729,1.3779,0.1701,0.001,0.2324,0.0687,5.7247,2.6191,0.9072,2.7854,7.122,7.4829,0.3692,4.9653,3.5937,5.7546,5.4941,1.6824,1.0333,1.0939,0.0005,0.0024,0.0257,3.8474,3.8631,6.2621,1.3992,1.1749,0.0653,2.3489,2.339,0.511,8.1775,0.0467,1.7668,1.8512,8.0341,2.0384,0.3962,1.2424,2.6227,0.1038,0.0153,0.0126,0.3627,2.6105,3.9255,2.7181,2.6486,0.0027,0.8611,4.386,2.6114,2.4435,2.1704,1.8667,4.8327,6.3438,2.377,15.3315,5.5655,11.7179,3.8764,1.1533,1.749,4.0078,0.0116,0.0121,0.09,0.887,6.869,3.2683,0.9699,2.7421,1.7379,6.9774,2.7112,4.2368,2.6741,5.657,7.3589,1.4564,0.0867,1.1955,1.4761,3.3974,3.9432,2.1358,3.5163,4.443,1.6602,3.0782,5.2907,0.3196,8.1651,4.9726,1.1458,1.4043,3.015,0.7728,0.0105,2.2657,5.8179,2.7358,1.9421,8.6015,0.0036,8.7544,1.1011,0.8207,3.6678,2.2382,5.9838,0.1632,7.734,4.776,4.2352,4.2596,0.0281,0.3335,1.2393,3.5305,0.4533,5.7673,4.6625,6.8624,0.0629,7.0131,3.2651,4.3606,6.2621,9.0953,3.3573,0.6906,8.1725,2.9871,8.3148,2.1663,1.1868,3.4388,3.9987,5.5151,0.3584,6.5568,0.7864,2.9339,5.2281,1.7995,4.9076,0.0185,0.0758,2.2449,0.9055,1.0065,1.0965,2.5484,3.1382,0.0004,3.9395,3.4693,1.5149,1.9645,5.3583,4.7277,0.9423,3.2065,4.3761,2.5432,0.1757,1.3241,4.4958,0.9434,3.2452,11.5271,1.6247,1.6389,1.6612,0.0006,0.3997,0.0389,4.0314,0.0778,3.4385,1.3739,2.9332,0.0939,3.3294,3.4636,1.4508,1.2378,0.0812,0.7754,0.8468,4.5164,7.0679,0.5483,3.1004,7.7955,1.4859,1.8443,2.6758,5.0111,7.6122,0.1489,3.441,4.7402,0.014,0.8159,5.0881,0.8688,3.3861,2.1712,0.312,3.4151,0.0078,3.323,3.5789,1.7103,2.5116,1.6171,3.312,3.0863,3.5592,4.3151,4.8038,6.4582,1.5025,3.9124,3.0832,1.2765,2.3124,0.3475,6.456,1.604,1.3649,1.2152,0.9017,2.7206,3.4813,1.1848,1.8698,1.7906,2.8816,5.7332,1.8378,6.8973,1.0193,6.6912,3.9053,0.7763,0.8428,1.3525,1.6168,1.2865,1.0065,1.5941,3.8095,1.7442,4.2509,0.1749,3.5563,3.8379,3.9448,1.7767,1.6598,4.3935,1.2821,6.0536,0.7099,0.2067]}

Before he took office, he promised to fire all of the people who were in charge of security for the inauguration.\nMany critics have said that the inauguration poses a greater danger than the original event, which took place over 500 years ago when Julius Caesar was inaugurated as First Roman Emperor.\nTrump also recently appeared to encourage violence in the U.S. Capitol, after saying he wanted \u201cstrong and tough\u201d people to take over the government.\nIn the interview, Trump spoke about his relationship with the outgoing Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Trump said McConnell\u2019s son is now working with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on a possible political run in 2022.\nIn the interview, Trump made it clear he would not accept Joe Biden as President should the former Vice President win the election.\nEarlier that day, the President tweeted a string of tweets calling on the Senate and the Speaker of the House to reject Joe Biden\u2019s election victory.\nOn Sunday, Trump asked Republican lawmakers to hold the impeachment session until January. Biden has expressed no intention of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would free Trump from office.\nTrump asked the Republican senators to push Biden to get to the Senate floor to accept the election results. Trump did not mention Biden\u2019s chances of winning, the size of the election margin, or Joe Biden\u2019s record in dealing with the president in a Senate trial.","token_len":384,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,2.6246,5.1897,0.002,0.7198,1.8309,3.8679,3.1009,9.5373,5.8751,5.5674,2.3654,1.1255,8.0171,1.3407,10.5174,0.0499,2.4804,0.8648,4.0932,0.5491,2.7565,4.188,2.0932,6.417,2.1149,8.6866,0.0025,3.5934,0.4525,0.6034,3.9712,2.0125,0.8229,6.3988,5.3467,3.4799,0.428,0.1526,15.3182,6.8266,0.019,0.3536,3.1399,5.1479,5.8535,5.3467,0.7457,8.6457,1.6606,3.9273,4.8355,3.2912,2.2687,0.3575,1.9959,1.6701,3.1816,8.6558,3.3296,0.5115,1.7699,1.1266,0.0125,4.1208,6.4691,5.2925,6.3397,3.5299,0.4635,0.2031,4.3295,0.6413,0.0441,12.5262,0.7169,3.4175,5.5224,0.7738,0.0029,6.284,2.7967,4.1126,0.2991,1.9835,0.0422,1.4801,4.9592,1.6514,1.8282,0.0883,0.5662,0.8418,3.7366,0.7056,7.419,2.2186,1.8491,1.0945,4.038,1.1045,2.4664,2.7598,1.24,0.0848,8.0397,2.0488,0.8082,5.7539,1.0907,1.7754,11.0524,5.5349,2.354,2.7464,1.0969,2.1332,6.6277,9.0026,0.4657,3.4554,2.5485,1.7755,1.4952,6.5228,3.2497,0.9979,1.7016,3.2404,0.0204,3.5943,7.2173,0.431,0.0337,3.992,7.6965,0.0117,2.3094,5.0166,0.0019,1.2422,8.5821,2.5972,0.0871,0.3946,0.5266,8.2091,3.5974,4.6992,5.1069,0.4596,6.2761,4.4957,2.0522,1.2134,2.3891,0.0003,0.0156,0.3341,2.6204,1.1263,3.9659,5.9044,1.6767,3.2892,16.7207,7.8867,8.4478,3.1552,6.1971,6.4162,6.3445,6.0219,0.6725,3.7164,2.2912,1.0418,2.6253,0.575,0.36,3.5201,2.1844,5.5982,0.9575,0.5916,4.6489,1.5283,1.634,4.6746,0.0195,1.6956,6.7706,3.6551,1.3088,0.0072,0.363,1.6859,0.0005,2.7452,2.8347,1.2444,2.7845,12.5743,5.6398,1.8706,5.2389,4.2191,3.6478,4.1155,1.285,3.7477,1.4016,0.9692,0.0019,0.0026,0.0005,1.0892,0.2941,0.0041,0.3937,1.8538,1.3955,3.5162,6.58,3.4184,2.9458,8.0247,0.3972,0.2954,3.6873,1.449,1.1995,0.2751,0.1857,4.8467,1.5648,0.0658,1.4078,2.0682,0.9388,4.3609,11.0331,0.3648,1.435,4.0037,7.3842,2.0678,2.2009,3.1551,0.0663,3.7378,0.5666,2.8153,0.467,0.4652,7.8734,4.6212,0.5223,0.0602,2.3407,3.8816,2.9224,2.4055,6.4768,0.0035,2.3425,3.5505,2.1041,1.9684,1.0668,4.4272,2.3082,5.224,0.5494,0.0095,0.0164,0.3305,4.265,6.4574,0.0357,2.0175,0.7703,0.2701,4.1306,4.7175,0.6317,0.3558,4.9851,1.1533,0.3063,1.4794,4.9122,4.2445,3.2208,0.5544,4.1266,3.0312,5.55,4.8961,3.3849,5.1547,2.6407,7.3731,2.9704,5.5517,3.5148,2.2331,0.5036,8.1034,0.6335,5.3287,0.1595,0.1553,1.2472,0.6175,3.2467,8.0258,5.3306,0.508,4.034,1.6375,0.3162,3.1091,5.5673,2.0821,3.0133,0.8124,0.4535,5.6095,6.7885,1.2267,4.217,3.4609,0.475,2.3592,0.2438,2.2174,6.4805,0.7015,3.6973,1.1228,0.9947,4.2907,4.1206,0.3982,3.218,2.5515,2.204,0.0196,0.005,6.0273,0.8681,0.7276,2.1861,6.0209,11.5117,0.1009,1.017,4.3507,6.0177,1.284,0.2877,8.0564,0.1955,0.5185,0.0157,0.0212,5.4949,1.6626,7.5255,0.0178,1.244,2.9485,3.89,2.9897,4.8274,7.1963,0.3951]}

The judge had found Cele's appointment \"illegitimate\" on a court papers filed in January.\nZuma, the president-elect, was sentenced to prison in October for corruption but is awaiting the appeal against the sentence in order to see if he is granted parole by the Supreme Court.\nThe ruling on the constitutionality of Cele's appointment upheld claims made by opposition politician Jacob Mafubane about Cele being \"politically appointed.\"\nThis \"openly political and partisan judicial action by Judge Cele\" meant that \"judicial independence is undermined,\" the appeal said. The move is likely to delay Zuma's pending appeal in the High Court.\nThe president-elect's office also said it wanted Cele - which is widely seen in the public eye as a loyal figure for Zuma - to be dismissed.\n\"I will never settle for the fact that Cele represents Mr Zuma,\" Mafubane told local news broadcaster eNCA, adding that Zuma must be ordered to pay Cele damages for the damage he caused to the opposition during the case against him.\nZuma resigned last month from his post as president, which was his last full term, as a result of an impasse with parliament about reforms to the Constitution. The government will wait until the Supreme Court decides the final outcome of the Zuma case, before it starts its own review process to appoint judges and other government officials.","token_len":384,"entropy":[8.1474,9.4137,10.007,2.4948,0.0074,0.0001,2.6367,7.4154,2.0948,0.9232,0.8203,1.641,2.8911,0.8662,0.7341,3.8866,6.9624,1.1238,1.8131,4.9634,2.7373,1.1439,6.9672,1.413,1.2097,5.8676,0.0472,5.1907,0.9062,0.3565,2.3262,1.7746,4.2555,5.541,2.3637,5.9972,2.9788,5.8836,1.0041,0.3526,18.2788,0.0109,1.2758,2.0936,0.9955,2.1618,1.9326,0.6786,3.5036,5.6896,7.0291,7.3437,8.7731,4.2418,3.6135,0.3623,1.3646,4.0173,1.4825,0.135,1.2468,2.3101,1.6157,1.4401,6.9185,0.0002,2.7967,0.0201,5.5293,6.3196,3.842,9.0997,5.0089,1.4814,5.5167,1.9481,2.5631,1.3892,4.5328,1.3808,1.7305,5.2867,2.4287,5.0123,10.0133,0.0005,1.0069,1.036,0.8499,0.6246,4.6606,0.5414,5.4913,4.9346,6.8044,12.4552,3.1576,2.8875,0.4282,3.1639,2.1832,1.9339,3.8276,3.4212,1.142,0.5653,2.8881,5.2733,0.0002,0.0201,0.5294,3.601,2.8287,5.6477,10.5411,3.2433,1.7236,3.2209,1.4199,0.3723,3.2109,0.0048,3.0133,3.526,2.4289,3.9797,0.0199,0.5111,2.9534,7.1097,0.3891,4.792,1.2927,3.1233,1.2192,1.9262,4.2078,3.229,4.2966,3.2445,3.7606,3.5482,0.8445,3.9513,3.9107,6.6164,0.0758,5.1214,0.5141,0.7327,2.6687,4.6173,1.6255,4.4106,0.6604,2.4033,0.005,0.4007,0.6417,1.813,2.7371,3.3461,1.0796,3.6712,0.0054,0.017,1.4356,0.0839,0.2043,7.8267,6.7176,2.0434,0.1635,5.9842,3.5603,4.9384,3.8827,5.469,6.6747,4.7117,5.2739,4.6631,2.5501,2.4648,4.07,0.09,6.3303,2.5829,0.785,5.9892,4.7932,9.1348,3.2824,3.3367,4.1805,6.3239,6.6288,3.5488,3.8317,6.618,1.3079,2.1096,6.5759,0.5161,2.9548,7.1836,4.5437,2.1135,5.4655,1.4523,1.3752,4.3737,1.1277,0.1658,3.3445,5.837,2.9701,2.3749,0.0425,4.9225,4.5051,0.0026,0.0772,7.0122,3.2227,2.9144,0.872,1.9376,0.0079,0.8471,0.3328,1.7577,4.2392,0.3641,0.0019,1.5771,1.8745,2.9055,0.7794,2.512,5.3897,2.6634,8.5383,5.5005,1.7818,4.9049,1.399,3.8436,1.4417,4.6393,2.1936,0.2526,0.9431,5.2545,5.27,4.3447,2.1745,0.0118,0.6276,0.1501,1.3542,4.997,1.7659,0.5223,1.6645,3.731,3.1937,5.0435,7.2752,1.2933,2.5956,4.5007,0.0765,5.8096,7.8636,5.9943,1.0441,0.0076,2.1538,3.6117,0.502,0.0091,0.0013,1.478,3.8658,2.1941,4.4377,9.3184,8.2834,3.6738,3.0964,1.5073,0.2725,2.6196,0.0047,4.0899,2.8891,6.5695,0.2515,2.5263,3.8755,5.5611,2.2953,1.9178,2.9151,1.1505,0.6929,1.1729,0.947,5.4874,4.6846,0.9905,6.6083,3.4399,0.5915,0.1817,0.2985,2.1542,0.0199,6.4796,3.1792,1.111,2.1746,1.4286,0.7312,0.9356,0.8042,2.5723,3.6114,1.7738,5.1564,1.6385,4.0965,0.8391,2.7547,3.2454,1.6603,0.8633,0.0052,3.406,4.6228,0.0383,1.7139,3.6905,5.4006,5.9625,0.8862,0.7188,4.3155,0.8896,2.7173,2.4978,4.7904,6.2773,1.4184,1.5816,1.7674,0.0086,2.9171,3.9435,6.5993,2.3928,0.2128,0.6125,7.9626,0.0689,1.4781,2.7425,4.5618,3.3894,5.4767,2.9456,3.2186,2.7237,3.9847,2.2347,6.4301,3.2173,3.2738,2.8205,3.4577,0.2389,0.5394]}

Several separatists were killed by security forces in May in clashes with the Cameroonian army, after a French-backed separatist group had killed hundreds of civilians while capturing some 30 towns in the southern parts of the country. Separatists have called for what they say is the right to self-determination for their Anglophone minority but government troops and rebels have fought since April.\nThe company has already begun ramping back production and will gradually resume operations, to reach full production by the end of 2013, the company told Reuters in a statement.

After weeks of seeing his agenda imperiled by Republican divisions and infighting among his aides, Trump has been a whirl of activity. The president on Tuesday visited the military installations that host his troops, vowing that the troops would not get hurt. In the meeting with troops, Trump again expressed sympathy for their families, though only a few of them are in the U.S. for the holidays. On his campaign trail, Trump also praised troops on Monday, telling them, \"you know, you guys do a great job, and I'm really proud of you guys.\nI\u2019m not a lawyer; I can\u2019t take legal advice, but the lawyers over at CNN and NBC News are really making the right point here: it would be impossible to get this done without a bipartisan approach.\nThe same is true for many of the things our elected officials do, starting with the rules that govern behavior in the White House. These things are not our problem; instead they are the problem of our representatives. That\u2019s what makes these laws a problem is because we, the people, have the right to hold our representatives to account and these laws violate that.\nNow let\u2019s see if the Trump administration can get out this time around, with a better message and a better approach.\nBut we do want our politicians to be clean and honest. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t have a private practice. But they should also understand that the people that they represent have their rights, and they do not need to spend the taxpayers\u2019 money illegally. When elected we have to give them a clean break, and to not even try to cover it up. It does not make sense to pay for private practice with taxpayer money just to make up for spending on illegal spending.","token_len":384,"entropy":[2.5562,4.1632,0.2754,7.4515,0.5887,0.0569,0.0466,2.9641,0.7078,0.0085,1.6819,4.2359,7.852,0.0072,0.8905,4.7587,3.9056,0.0497,7.2167,1.9375,5.0239,10.1656,0.1616,0.8694,3.8624,6.6633,1.3543,6.4501,0.0003,4.2205,1.4267,4.259,0.2529,1.734,1.5441,3.486,5.2735,7.6675,3.1082,1.0637,6.6425,1.3423,2.975,1.6478,6.1313,1.8963,5.5703,2.2217,5.4519,5.5692,3.5683,5.588,2.7701,3.9952,1.2863,8.2587,0.0123,2.6966,1.76,4.573,1.0007,2.855,5.0749,4.3681,1.2449,3.9617,2.0657,6.4157,0.89,4.0226,1.0888,0.7693,5.7842,4.2053,5.9531,0.2688,2.8193,2.674,1.3271,5.0579,4.8427,2.622,1.2776,2.47,1.0,3.3538,2.6551,1.0849,2.6096,0.0004,0.0025,0.0754,6.5184,1.4689,3.5567,0.183,4.0301,3.5851,3.77,0.4176,0.2818,0.2933,4.2784,4.2375,5.4598,3.7881,4.5853,1.8377,3.4691,2.3368,2.159,0.0708,5.8358,2.2604,0.591,2.6796,3.9762,4.1194,1.0294,0.7667,0.0062,1.7918,1.4099,1.678,1.5265,3.8766,0.9794,0.1671,0.4647,1.7872,2.0363,4.5594,15.396,18.0163,8.8301,1.3141,3.1933,3.325,7.5995,4.9205,0.2508,4.58,4.0831,1.2601,0.0596,4.8242,3.5774,0.7875,2.1777,1.0051,4.0886,6.4892,7.6187,1.9585,4.9668,2.0773,1.5083,3.4558,1.0137,3.7967,5.3658,2.899,4.1958,5.359,3.8662,4.3422,4.9294,4.128,0.3117,5.5538,1.2278,2.5314,4.4873,2.0932,0.9788,2.6237,6.3696,4.4137,1.088,1.8047,8.3153,5.6291,1.8947,0.0806,1.3949,4.2054,1.2161,0.8245,6.6029,6.0583,5.4683,0.4004,1.607,2.263,6.808,0.0983,2.1952,6.0137,2.529,0.9204,8.0657,2.0983,1.0436,3.5897,0.001,0.354,4.0558,4.4535,1.2905,2.638,5.7268,3.9805,3.1948,6.0108,2.8382,0.636,1.2889,1.1088,0.5964,1.0413,5.0997,0.6537,4.0884,7.7283,0.8085,1.3821,1.9022,3.4812,3.9149,4.7079,4.3078,1.3447,8.1099,3.5717,2.5379,5.1823,1.3367,0.9574,0.5484,1.8747,2.783,2.7924,0.093,5.6188,1.8716,2.2798,2.0894,0.3414,2.5815,7.9614,1.0182,5.2617,1.7684,1.8573,0.9113,4.6563,4.0402,3.2212,0.8444,0.2007,3.5921,1.7828,2.2599,3.0361,0.3353,1.2305,2.6294,4.3378,6.589,5.6063,2.0744,2.3421,3.8102,1.6764,4.7968,5.9116,2.1292,0.8044,1.1845,3.5864,0.9754,1.0624,5.27,3.4477,3.5885,4.939,3.7166,3.4728,0.1386,2.1609,7.7925,1.383,1.6762,1.4414,3.3965,2.9352,0.1812,0.1828,0.878,1.9678,3.1698,2.1145,3.9819,0.0871,0.003,4.9973,1.7249,5.8484,7.3952,2.0071,1.4605,2.4527,2.0273,4.9643,3.8516,0.349,2.4911,2.993,3.1722,2.4797,1.5116,2.2611,3.4436,3.1494,1.9467,1.3046,1.6005,3.778,1.9361,2.6026,0.6735,4.5889,3.0699,4.3562,6.0996,0.0502,3.5471,8.0384,1.4735,5.2776,5.8886,6.2472,1.8081,1.4982,4.4651,0.8285,2.4754,5.3104,3.1425,1.5668,0.8027,3.8702,3.8778,6.3007,2.989,0.285,4.6104,3.1314,0.1268,0.6246,3.764,4.1248,0.309,1.8043,0.5217,0.7176,4.6492,1.1279,4.505,1.9343,4.1051,0.83,0.6595,6.2183,1.0559,2.4043,2.78,0.3603,6.3528,2.5636,4.4948,4.7649,0.3575]}

An explosive expert said the man\u2019s \u201cmost likely\u201d motivation was to gain publicity for a case of child neglect, with the police lab only able to determine what wasn\u2019t explosive in the bags a man said contained a bomb, reports The Globe and Mail. \u2026 The pair were charged after a man in Toronto said he had picked up bags containing \u201cmore than just rocks\u201d at their house, and asked the police not to report the matter to the media because he might get into trouble. \u2026 After days of deliberation, the jury found Peter Diefenbaker, 29, guilty of possession of a weapon with the intent to use it in a terrorist act. Police found more than 300 items at the couple\u2019s residence, including a cellphone, a bag, and an unopened box that contained a metal object wrapped in cloth and a plastic tube that measured about an inch in diameter and three inches long. The tube contained gas. A number of weapons were also found. An explosive expert testified the object was most likely an ordinary lighter, or \u201cmatch\u201d as many people are accustomed to calling them, rather than an explosive. The jury returned no verdict on the two terrorism charges after three days of deliberations.\nThis week: we report the results of our surveys, and give thanks to those of you who have donated.\nPete Johnson: Hey, there\u2019s a lot going on with us over at the United Way during the month of January.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed , the White House said","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Monday. Mulvaney was slated to be transferred Monday to the Office of Management and Budget in a move likely due to controversy over the agency's conduct before the inauguration, including investigations into the Trump campaign. Mulvaney was the most top government official to criticize Trump after the deadly mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, and before calling for a halt to a controversial immigration policy.\"There is serious and legitimate question about the administration's handling of the consumer financing agency,\u201d Mulvaney told GOP senators in his prepared testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee. \u201cIn fact, I think it's fair to say that the entire agency is being tainted by the public's concerns about the administration. It\u2019s not just Mick Mulvaney. It\u2019s not just the president. It\u2019s the entire administration.\u201d Mulvaney will oversee the CFPB's ongoing investigations into auto loan repayment issues and whether the company used its power to make auto loans available at below-market interest rates.Mulvaney, who is reportedly unpopular with the president's Cabinet, had said on social media that he felt Trump was sending the wrong message to Americans about the shooting.

President of the Senate Republican Leader, Bob Corker in a rare verbal fight with the President over the administration\u2019s response in the impeachment proceeding, saying the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to produce documents and transcripts raises \u201cgrave concerns.\u201d\nThe president didn\u2019t go away, and on Sunday, told reporters on a visit for the upcoming U.S. presidential election, \u201cI didn\u2019t call her a liar, I didn\u2019t call her a crook, I didn\u2019t call her a traitor. And if that\u2019s what he meant, maybe he should give me a little definition\u201d of those terms.\nFor a little context, in the early days of the Trump administration, as we first heard, and later confirmed, the President was not only accusing his predecessor of a number of crimes but even of crimes that did not exist \u2013 a situation that clearly would have made a mockery of the traditional judicial system. Trump himself \u2013 at first without proof and later, with little to nothing, accusing the Democratic Party of being part of a massive plot of obstruction, to take over the government in Washington (and a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d) against him and his associates.\nAs you might imagine, the president\u2019s allies, who had been accused of a number of crimes, were ready to take matters into their own hands and sue against him personally, in the hope of destroying him.\nIt has been a rough week, for the President, for his allies, and for the Republicans in Congress who have come to terms with the fact that Donald Trump is a serial liar and a manipulator who is now a danger to national security.","token_len":385,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,5.3359,4.137,0.4302,3.936,6.333,2.695,0.0424,0.8888,1.0778,2.3146,2.2621,3.0243,3.0304,5.4298,2.1139,5.4203,3.9172,0.0155,0.2207,2.2387,1.2975,0.0114,2.4329,6.7884,9.9359,0.8463,0.911,0.6019,2.7888,0.0015,1.0089,3.8649,6.6558,0.0002,4.2228,0.3972,7.3905,7.51,0.1958,1.1189,3.945,4.6614,2.4671,3.773,0.027,6.1299,2.0069,6.0108,5.9142,4.6414,0.5544,1.5161,1.8759,1.3043,1.4416,3.9788,15.1321,7.4571,5.7369,5.1422,5.5283,1.6872,9.1461,4.4258,2.252,5.1762,2.4647,4.156,0.3601,8.5032,0.3447,0.0182,4.3884,0.0437,6.771,2.1568,2.9541,4.3703,7.3828,11.5492,4.6694,9.4915,1.4029,1.9286,2.3829,7.6897,1.3435,10.2616,3.0584,6.4143,1.7133,2.1829,0.4783,4.9045,4.0482,1.8813,1.6609,4.4221,2.8544,0.9597,7.5553,1.6919,3.981,3.4263,3.3395,6.7284,1.2348,6.0293,5.3444,0.0021,0.0771,0.1637,4.645,0.993,1.6526,3.4559,1.6574,4.4323,4.9269,1.0325,0.4688,0.0044,6.2514,5.7169,2.9295,0.1526,1.5719,2.1828,1.2986,0.0592,0.2482,0.0196,2.2052,0.0987,0.3206,4.2917,0.0137,0.8737,0.8815,0.7543,0.0167,0.1,0.0325,0.664,0.0357,0.2783,3.5466,1.1837,2.7192,4.164,2.8111,1.7583,0.1782,0.4054,1.1826,2.9729,3.1122,0.5512,5.9382,1.2514,2.056,4.633,2.9303,0.7881,3.3944,10.1831,4.0932,7.4833,2.7121,5.4808,2.2724,0.7006,0.8065,4.8526,3.0705,5.422,7.1851,0.3704,3.6401,1.6682,3.855,0.8001,0.0889,0.6355,0.9794,0.5709,0.2873,4.9127,2.5714,6.5068,2.9319,2.71,4.4683,5.8494,5.2592,0.9885,1.874,2.147,1.8553,3.1414,2.9653,5.6631,2.7864,1.5979,0.2192,3.8745,5.7576,0.0015,2.5762,2.886,5.5247,3.669,5.4473,1.6397,4.0939,0.1171,3.2179,6.0562,3.3764,5.0289,0.5641,5.8841,4.1011,1.1912,3.1243,2.5904,3.7627,0.0772,0.8318,6.9332,5.0146,0.6799,1.0396,5.2405,3.9343,6.1262,4.2095,3.8948,5.2353,6.0558,3.1563,1.8904,2.7674,2.4031,5.1289,2.7134,5.1692,2.7824,6.8912,1.6427,4.9363,2.1143,0.2797,2.5937,4.8878,0.0152,1.1371,5.6489,4.1655,4.379,2.9219,2.7896,3.9973,4.3183,1.6795,0.4662,3.5078,3.2637,3.1872,4.9059,2.1063,4.6807,11.5616,1.1309,9.7729,2.32,0.0108,0.9128,1.7976,0.8364,6.1981,0.704,2.5738,0.476,3.3711,1.3099,0.7559,3.5465,3.7245,2.129,1.5726,0.0708,1.6316,2.8732,4.2472,0.188,0.0076,8.057,3.0222,3.0603,2.5099,1.5366,5.9013,0.333,3.3335,2.2052,0.002,1.1926,1.7832,1.5974,5.8717,0.2104,2.884,3.6954,0.0223,0.0132,0.0018,0.0015,1.8207,5.7052,4.845,1.6703,5.8517,1.6854,3.3944,1.7729,1.792,1.1779,5.6571,2.2116,1.1726,1.7394,3.8677,3.9616,0.7313,2.0922,5.292,2.6474,3.2416,2.8402,2.4708,2.1875,1.4393,1.0813,2.4255,2.5181,0.5032,0.7396,0.2833,0.7708,5.309,2.0934,0.291,2.0749,1.3232,4.6312,0.905,4.9562,0.0296,0.948,0.7461,0.0299,5.0805,0.0871,1.1665,1.9898,4.2927,0.3744,1.2261,1.1573,5.846,0.0079,2.4602,1.6665,4.1383,3.4051,3.3899,0.0708,2.9372,0.012,1.0577]}

Let\u2019s work to overcome the obstacles they faced in the US, get them back to their families and give hope to generations of victims of human trafficking,\u201d he said.","token_len":385,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1615,3.1031,8.8488,4.7282,6.7684,3.4233,2.7114,0.1974,7.3498,3.0205,3.7568,10.6576,0.8505,1.6513,10.3622,6.9409,1.817,9.3308,1.4371,6.2969,5.8812,3.6828,1.4953,0.0102,12.7325,0.0046,4.0379,0.0257,12.9568,3.9635,2.2661,0.0222,7.8932,6.9365,0.6366,3.803,5.1891,0.7471,5.952,0.7609,3.5482,2.6806,5.3398,0.1833,2.2501,6.4327,0.9839,0.404,23.7432,0.845,0.0107,2.2595,0.0005,0.0001,2.1668,0.7741,0.0075,0.0172,0.0111,0.0094,3.5552,2.3177,5.5183,2.7547,1.8095,0.3892,0.034,2.4294,0.5021,4.4208,0.2649,1.4512,5.7092,1.8394,3.4441,6.417,0.0625,3.7408,13.4778,9.3067,3.5794,1.5653,3.4644,6.6018,1.8154,2.4208,1.0729,5.8111,0.7928,0.431,14.6975,5.1413,8.2661,2.8965,2.0131,1.378,2.3396,5.6528,0.2821,3.4163,1.4282,6.7881,7.1276,1.5199,0.5272,1.5169,2.0865,0.3082,4.0025,1.907,3.3536,11.5221,0.8885,5.5951,4.4255,7.1895,4.4559,4.5225,3.4709,3.7061,2.8842,3.8308,0.0435,0.8688,0.9591,2.7739,2.4715,3.1109,1.4815,1.2133,1.9454,4.6232,2.0859,3.8353,0.354,3.9896,0.4164,6.4271,1.8239,5.3309,0.4738,4.3898,0.6618,4.1569,1.625,1.482,4.4662,1.4894,1.8627,0.9582,4.4248,1.1875,3.0071,0.8421,3.0525,3.8411,0.1565,6.5373,1.7801,2.0681,2.9758,3.4272,3.5122,4.0626,6.521,1.036,3.6859,1.242,5.8604,1.3593,3.0903,8.4209,1.8201,2.4187,0.822,0.5008,2.5903,0.6197,2.6219,3.3768,2.5637,7.3215,1.6104,5.4734,6.2256,0.5139,0.3372,2.3177,4.3754,3.2884,5.7148,4.5722,1.6691,6.5302,2.7075,1.5797,5.7362,7.3402,0.9846,2.2612,1.0394,2.267,3.1794,3.6663,0.9051,0.8697,0.8978,3.1284,0.3285,3.858,2.0468,0.4266,1.6464,2.773,2.8741,3.5554,2.7633,4.9126,2.3857,2.6855,1.8605,1.9722,1.3061,1.6115,2.1277,1.3547,3.7058,6.8285,2.7315,4.6396,0.775,0.9051,2.4982,0.2349,0.4565,6.5396,0.0853,5.5367,3.3916,3.6338,5.0045,0.0573,0.2895,1.9392,4.1142,3.7217,0.7361,3.4348,1.9662,4.4823,0.0006,0.007,0.0021,1.4887,5.3106,3.8909,4.1578,5.2669,7.7919,0.4002,8.7594,1.1239,1.6872,0.8536,6.2305,2.4626,0.0006,0.0127,0.0013,4.3779,0.3382,2.2405,4.1833,8.4471,3.0098,1.4482,5.3086,5.0779,0.0372,5.1786,0.001,0.021,0.0104,2.9786,0.0276,0.0016,0.0029,1.0789,3.0853,2.1896,2.4698,3.2276,3.4164,0.1456,3.5868,4.1981,0.5588,0.0119,4.4827,2.6128,2.0487,2.9193,1.4745,2.8371,4.8557,9.7489,0.5265,2.701,0.0053,0.5392,4.4416,2.5218,7.6483,0.0683,5.3694,1.4422,0.1149,0.3282,2.1496,8.0091,0.2499,4.7855,1.1954,0.0046,0.5999,2.4653,0.6061,0.6436,1.5701,0.33,4.7617,1.0485,4.8368,1.2263,2.2101,0.5642,0.8881,7.2521,2.1033,3.1472,2.157,0.0842,1.4516,5.3924,7.8855,6.9811,0.7697,3.5915,1.943,6.9095,2.3119,4.0642,2.9332,2.7254,2.291,2.1441,5.1699,2.766,6.9036,1.2261,2.1691,1.3402,1.12,1.8515,1.3768,4.3589,5.3908,0.5849,7.2168,0.9401,4.716,1.6631,4.3325,0.2857,1.7609,3.5784,1.0719,1.3884,0.5588,0.1903]}

More","text":"Police in the Sicilian capital of Palermo scooped up 25 suspected mobsters on an array of charges on Tuesday, including a woman accused of filling in as boss for her imprisoned husband. More than 30 defendants appeared in court in Palermo with police dressed in riot gear and armed with batons and tear gas. Police said one woman had run a cocaine-smuggling operation and had hired local henchmen to protect her from police raids. Other men were accused of extorting money in several cities under the control of the notorious Carmine Laino crime family, which is thought to be one of Italy's most profitable and dangerous organized crime groups. Laino is serving a 28-year jail term for fraud after a prison break and later fleeing Italy with $800,000 stolen from a supermarket chain.\nActress Nicole Kidman was on an all-expenses paid holiday with husband Keith Urban in the Greek islands as she finished filming scenes for her upcoming movie, 'Tenet'. In a video obtained by People Magazine, she said she was filming in Greece near the islands where she and her family vacationed in July. \"This week I started filming where I went island hopping in the summer of 2006,\" she said. \"So if you've been following the news you have seen some of the photos of me in Greece. That was a year and a half that my whole family went island hopping on a Greek holiday with an all-expenses paid trip courtesy of my amazing husband and then there was a lot of news coverage of it. So you can imagine the excitement I had because the movie starts on the day I get back. I have to finish it before I leave. \" The 51-year-old actress was in Greece for only a brief time and she said she would remain there until December 21, when a special event at the festival where her movie screened will take place.","token_len":385,"entropy":[4.2087,2.5416,9.8335,0.0867,1.3789,2.0064,4.4506,0.0671,0.0001,13.0535,0.2133,0.0686,6.4911,5.3905,7.0629,0.2912,3.3576,5.6057,7.6456,0.0065,2.0747,4.2749,1.8537,1.0978,1.231,4.8141,6.5739,2.3898,0.0234,7.8989,1.6165,4.811,7.3916,3.775,4.3308,10.8289,1.6864,0.872,7.1433,0.3476,3.2157,5.2516,5.43,0.776,0.5171,2.1493,2.9062,0.0052,0.0048,4.9633,4.5552,6.3027,0.2329,1.5042,0.0478,1.3273,3.2972,0.3718,2.1127,0.0079,1.8137,3.5983,0.2412,0.6144,2.8102,1.1325,4.0167,3.2555,1.7975,5.2098,3.8671,6.9159,2.3491,2.4588,0.065,0.015,0.8153,2.2343,2.9015,5.0368,6.8096,7.3225,0.0031,0.0236,0.7188,5.5073,0.3032,2.0905,3.4449,4.9676,0.2077,5.888,3.4363,1.3391,2.3826,0.0389,6.4365,0.0105,1.3253,4.6148,6.721,3.041,6.5383,0.509,5.8936,0.0054,1.9507,3.8807,9.7534,2.8771,5.7311,8.8848,2.1803,5.6536,0.8081,1.5584,1.2994,2.2887,3.5175,0.0172,2.147,5.0048,0.0207,2.7175,0.0002,1.2504,5.0106,2.9349,4.5297,5.6619,0.0281,1.6948,0.1014,3.8346,0.0211,0.004,1.6035,7.3585,0.7271,5.5701,0.0258,0.041,2.6859,0.8776,0.6652,4.6566,3.6403,2.8289,6.0564,3.0941,3.2006,6.4062,5.4992,3.4191,3.1926,3.2789,5.5927,0.3364,0.0016,5.1497,0.3221,2.5744,6.8764,4.7125,0.5623,2.2197,19.881,2.6237,4.8419,0.2666,0.0075,2.1413,4.7395,5.7266,4.6364,0.0422,2.7003,0.0837,1.0115,2.1504,1.3953,6.0436,8.7129,7.2427,1.4085,2.4448,6.5335,3.2972,5.4684,2.4485,6.9025,1.829,5.574,0.4453,1.5209,1.4688,2.142,1.497,3.5636,8.5012,6.1429,2.3627,3.9738,1.554,2.6235,4.5874,0.0449,5.7837,3.6555,0.2221,1.5989,1.3109,1.2899,1.38,4.8421,2.535,3.2951,8.0875,0.8715,4.9857,2.7726,0.7306,2.6603,0.365,3.3091,5.986,0.2665,2.5426,4.4549,1.1877,1.7541,3.7109,5.4667,1.1989,4.7319,1.2116,5.9421,0.8167,4.3522,10.6607,2.4544,2.9656,1.4907,2.5859,1.7437,3.9195,1.2778,0.228,0.3092,0.513,0.4966,3.9392,5.2601,0.7546,3.8777,1.7147,3.5696,2.3972,1.6872,2.7127,4.136,1.7261,3.6247,1.2043,0.4922,4.8491,1.1771,2.0036,2.0412,1.3979,1.4249,4.2888,2.0815,2.2655,4.8032,2.9355,0.0502,0.0089,7.222,4.5653,5.6977,1.5122,2.2468,3.9333,0.009,4.3825,2.2358,5.5903,3.5794,3.9684,5.1752,3.4853,0.2832,0.239,0.223,0.1859,3.0342,10.3571,0.0281,1.9386,7.0426,0.6262,2.7737,6.6361,4.7584,0.6658,1.4738,3.707,0.2111,3.8805,3.8188,1.7661,3.5014,1.0629,2.3546,4.8495,2.4247,1.4507,2.0754,2.3619,2.9931,1.715,4.8422,3.4861,6.5334,6.5616,3.3932,1.6916,3.9224,1.4062,3.34,1.9108,3.417,1.4402,3.884,1.7017,4.9323,1.8825,3.4176,1.2254,1.9368,1.8282,3.9,5.9562,7.7941,0.0347,0.003,0.0059,0.0007,1.4849,2.6106,3.1954,2.9966,1.7593,6.5933,1.2473,5.0349,1.1521,3.049,3.5404,1.8651,0.5579,3.5053,6.6901,1.835,1.2734,5.7541,5.4891,1.2158,1.2086,3.7104,3.9064,4.3077,4.2368,0.6651,6.5513,3.9838,3.1238,4.5485,8.396,2.6333,1.1567,0.0132,0.3794]}

{"prompt":"Drone owners in Europe will have to register their devices if dangerous and aircraft makers ensure that black box recordings can be downloaded in real-time if a plane is in distress under a sweeping reform","text":"Drone owners in Europe will have to register their devices if dangerous and aircraft makers ensure that black box recordings can be downloaded in real-time if a plane is in distress under a sweeping reform bill agreed between the EU and the FAA late Tuesday.\nThe European Parliament backed the measure with a majority of 434 votes to 55 and the European Commission and European Council also backed the bill which seeks to set a common standard in Europe.\nIt now follows an initial agreement with Washington that was approved by the FAA at the end of last month. However, legislation that would have required the Federal Aviation Administration to grant civil aviation authorities access to black boxes\u2019 content in real time when an uncontrollable airliner is out of control has been shot down in the US Senate.\nUS aircraft makers would still have to agree to these measures, however if they do not then they would have to pay a penalty.\nWhile the bill has been hailed as an important step, it comes as the FAA has not yet clarified on whether it would accept these sweeping reforms, which could be a concern to the European Union.\nThe bill would require electronic monitoring of data from the cockpit of a black box recording, and would allow national investigators to access to its contents.\nIt would also authorise national governments to request information from manufacturers on specific aspects of black box systems, including data from a pilot\u2019s brain, for a full investigation of a crash that caused a fatality.\nIt is unclear how much European authorities would retain access to pilot data under the proposed reforms. The current draft bill does not provide for the retention of all data from a black box but instead only for that which is required for a national investigation. It still leaves much to be seen how much of the data is to remain private.\nHowever, the new system has been a long time coming as black boxes have previously been made available upon demand to national authorities upon request.","token_len":386,"entropy":[7.4127,10.0051,3.4396,4.9529,3.4009,1.8148,0.4437,5.1086,1.3955,4.6871,4.9707,12.115,4.4364,10.8321,7.0381,8.3926,1.705,9.464,2.3849,7.0033,3.4785,0.6364,4.6449,3.625,2.9615,2.9204,0.0067,5.0695,2.9001,3.3568,1.1279,2.758,2.7197,8.24,2.9304,9.5707,6.636,3.777,5.5585,4.7882,0.8352,1.9396,0.3366,0.922,7.1445,5.7523,5.4399,0.4058,0.1783,14.113,4.044,2.6204,5.3048,0.3625,3.5722,4.0863,1.6036,2.9433,0.3817,5.2392,5.5932,1.4959,0.9305,6.7041,3.1935,1.7261,1.5184,1.4527,4.3017,2.8841,1.6836,5.4731,1.6493,0.8451,1.6176,5.5823,5.3071,0.1368,5.3428,2.16,4.2773,1.2094,3.8115,5.4344,2.4249,0.2438,4.3562,5.8275,5.3963,3.0244,3.2825,4.2356,2.4837,7.1891,2.0963,4.1856,4.2024,0.8832,1.0264,6.1625,5.1195,0.9387,1.6844,0.0014,1.7248,1.2748,0.8537,4.5936,0.1716,6.6654,3.0227,2.0802,1.2858,1.6317,2.1512,5.3988,0.0287,0.4969,0.2219,5.7603,6.895,1.8311,5.1065,2.3018,0.0445,2.0091,0.8273,17.6462,6.5785,8.5742,4.6366,2.8767,0.7963,5.0635,3.0651,11.0609,0.0091,6.4212,0.3874,5.6204,0.1684,0.7084,2.6529,0.7685,7.1946,0.027,2.204,1.5181,3.8951,9.0762,0.7985,0.2514,5.7193,4.6442,3.5321,4.6909,3.0344,0.8584,0.1804,4.953,0.6365,5.2863,3.2523,2.0363,3.3099,4.8025,1.6868,1.9886,1.1644,3.5265,1.7072,1.1159,1.0006,0.1288,3.2641,1.6242,2.4418,2.7112,0.6103,5.3714,1.0815,1.9689,2.677,1.247,3.7025,0.7881,1.9751,1.138,0.2663,2.9425,1.5261,4.4808,2.3316,1.4167,2.9007,1.8189,4.7102,1.7925,4.6525,4.8143,2.0867,0.8339,1.4075,3.7768,4.9157,8.2367,1.2579,2.7589,1.6196,2.4397,3.299,2.9342,6.0025,2.3893,3.0222,3.5132,1.8499,1.0985,0.3165,1.4887,2.1215,2.0515,2.1086,5.1885,2.4256,0.4715,6.6552,3.3211,3.3066,3.8317,1.1053,1.8272,3.7916,0.1034,6.8874,2.205,2.4904,1.5656,2.8142,5.7631,5.9959,0.1837,2.853,6.1443,5.7601,0.9701,1.7945,0.7177,3.1452,1.3298,0.2611,7.7064,0.013,4.4715,3.2501,0.2323,3.9325,2.5455,0.6343,4.2498,2.3034,5.6845,5.3526,0.038,2.266,0.6127,3.4992,1.4454,1.2855,4.9119,2.4199,4.0034,2.8222,8.5259,0.8222,6.595,7.8888,1.6267,4.6018,3.1379,5.0808,1.7799,2.421,1.9014,1.349,2.9573,4.4355,2.0028,7.6854,0.0001,0.7594,0.3001,2.8952,2.3509,2.4795,1.841,1.6129,5.9948,3.05,0.4982,6.0707,2.0417,0.0868,6.7911,0.8294,4.2149,0.3261,3.2021,1.7449,0.7084,2.6875,5.2785,6.0497,2.1055,2.5712,0.1608,3.2385,1.3646,1.8617,4.7901,0.0781,4.5887,1.3202,2.3873,2.2558,1.0779,0.0047,4.6869,4.1481,2.9422,2.7188,4.6814,2.242,0.983,3.3326,2.0156,1.6376,3.6755,0.9603,0.5334,4.2433,5.6361,4.2108,4.657,0.7323,0.0481,3.1685,2.598,1.9613,2.2381,0.823,0.8784,2.8937,4.0303,3.8949,1.7163,1.0957,0.2549,3.9969,0.1976,1.3841,3.8436,5.5033,3.0364,1.1346,4.8688,3.7093,0.3911,0.1782,2.9898,3.5366,0.8131,1.0701,6.6306,0.2078,4.8466,0.6947,7.5331,3.9264,3.0245,5.1209,0.8694,7.9724,0.3287,0.649]}

The announcement on Sunday will be presented to the EU on March 23 at a special meeting of the Eurogroup.\nAsked by French newspaper 'Lib\u00e9ration' on whether France, together with Germany, had taken the decision to avoid the summit after the recent statement made by German Chancellor and Prime Minister Angela Merkel in the Austrian city of Salzburg, Mr Griveaux said, 'If it is the case, we have certainly made certain decisions. The President of the European Council made the following clear: 'The crisis is not over, the crisis in Greece is not over, the crisis in Europe is not over, but we want to change the course. '\nThe new French president had said on Saturday that Greece had reached 'a crucial moment' in a process which had seen its reforms come to 'a standstill'. Mr Macron had called for the leaders of the European Union to recognise that there was'more to do than simply pass on the money'.\n'They will have to say to Greece and to the people of Europe what the rest of the changes are that are necessary,' Mr Macron said at a conference in Austria.","token_len":387,"entropy":[10.9507,0.0111,10.5044,8.8372,3.6552,0.7534,4.7505,5.6043,4.4246,1.4356,7.3577,0.2988,4.961,0.3986,3.5941,2.8041,4.2827,3.7417,4.2577,3.0673,0.0306,4.1093,1.4099,2.1014,5.8595,0.9491,4.822,1.3981,3.8879,9.5331,3.8942,4.0078,4.7365,0.6756,1.5303,1.9336,0.2203,0.2075,14.6405,4.9228,2.5382,1.4397,2.891,7.5324,4.8281,9.9693,2.8686,5.8132,3.352,11.1875,1.6886,0.452,3.6731,0.0004,6.7378,0.7368,2.2015,5.4039,4.3727,0.5071,5.4226,1.7735,5.1793,6.3793,4.9556,1.193,2.6751,2.5195,2.3756,0.6939,1.0508,2.0423,0.1943,11.2663,3.6405,2.8994,0.6821,0.1739,4.7273,1.4091,0.0048,0.002,3.2069,0.7367,1.4135,1.7608,5.6559,2.6167,0.58,6.1928,0.1929,1.4659,2.5041,2.0566,8.1896,2.9354,2.9824,0.4303,0.1869,0.77,0.6242,0.886,6.7978,0.9405,3.1695,0.6524,0.6208,1.9944,6.4762,0.0542,2.1209,1.8179,4.5284,1.0512,4.1841,1.1295,5.7772,1.7877,5.4597,6.5428,0.7393,2.8668,3.2618,4.6435,5.6105,0.6023,1.6685,5.1155,0.3071,4.6371,2.1104,5.6596,0.5255,1.429,0.181,5.3088,3.6173,1.4212,7.3567,3.1745,0.1844,4.3824,0.0305,3.7895,6.0387,4.0705,1.2072,6.4056,4.092,3.2077,0.195,3.8854,5.5209,3.9719,3.3584,1.2362,4.3226,0.8962,2.8849,5.7901,4.1325,1.2629,3.3241,1.5629,5.432,0.9811,0.8612,3.0173,4.8818,3.096,3.0931,3.2938,1.3961,3.2136,0.9414,0.2976,0.5263,5.1225,0.2061,1.3661,0.3329,5.5999,2.927,2.9856,3.017,6.5956,7.9529,0.5102,0.0025,0.2354,2.7793,3.8355,2.0643,3.8296,6.9022,0.0008,1.7658,0.6718,2.0545,3.5984,1.7766,1.3774,0.355,6.8225,3.1779,7.2246,5.0435,1.906,4.1096,6.9133,4.1398,0.158,3.272,0.3449,9.1762,4.2279,0.0029,1.7451,0.0011,3.5757,2.4845,6.8739,3.3871,0.0485,5.8119,0.0148,0.0004,0.5473,0.3111,0.5067,0.0033,0.0021,0.3343,3.0656,4.6091,4.155,2.7575,1.1729,3.2562,0.9655,1.0489,1.7823,2.5034,7.3009,2.6583,5.1236,3.2848,1.7417,3.295,5.1825,1.5532,0.4752,0.7497,1.7224,4.722,1.8475,3.5079,4.2757,2.2753,1.4549,2.5317,6.5111,2.0158,1.5194,1.495,2.1237,2.0167,1.4397,4.4823,3.6154,0.5431,0.5224,0.055,1.0325,1.1325,0.2172,0.3197,3.4657,0.262,0.2015,0.0944,1.5886,3.4682,1.4483,4.4962,0.2498,5.8039,1.2904,1.8923,3.6644,4.5904,1.3499,2.0995,4.4044,2.4148,1.5273,4.1292,1.9192,1.8043,2.1921,0.2368,4.5211,1.8888,4.1476,5.3944,1.575,5.0625,2.277,0.8912,1.2539,3.8257,3.4399,2.0701,1.6704,2.8244,2.6742,6.7462,3.4041,0.8855,5.6474,1.697,3.0388,0.0064,0.7044,3.2227,0.8449,1.6924,3.3702,0.9641,2.1714,6.5672,0.2654,0.5232,2.324,0.3717,0.5812,5.7813,1.4602,3.6288,0.684,16.9798,8.9616,1.4695,2.9956,8.6985,4.0681,5.2896,2.1511,1.473,4.4505,9.6731,0.3906,3.8473,4.5036,2.8382,1.8199,0.1542,5.1858,3.2502,3.4315,2.7522,1.1724,1.3965,4.2239,0.2549,2.3483,3.5797,2.5361,7.2602,0.0257,0.6643,8.134,1.3342,4.0246,1.7243,1.3824,2.099,1.0457,0.317,0.4438,3.2356,0.6846,3.8721,0.7569,4.5283,0.5779]}
{"prompt":"An army bomb disposal team was sent to a house in northern England after police arrested four men on Tuesday on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism . Three men , aged 22 , 36","text":"An army bomb disposal team was sent to a house in northern England after police arrested four men on Tuesday on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism. Three men, aged 22, 36 and 44, and a woman, aged 34, were arrested for allegedly planning to bomb a military base in Northern Ireland. Police said the suspects had been planning to carry out bombings in Europe, specifically Britain, the United States and Canada. Three officers received moderate wounds as they tried to save a woman who had swallowed an explosive belt. There were no casualties in the police raid, which started about 6 p.m. Wednesday. The bombs were discovered in a bedroom, and investigators believe they have to do with sectarian violence. Sgt. Peter Taylor said the bombs had been made the night before the police raid in Cambridgeshire, northeast of London. Police said the bombs may have contained chemical agents. Police did not know what the explosives looked like. A bomb squad had to deactivate the bombs and remove the explosives, Taylor said, before returning the suspects to police custody. \"We can't be sure how long these explosives were around and how much of them was left,\" he said. \"What we do know, is that they were in the home and that they were under threat,\" Taylor continued. \"It is believed there are other bombs in the area and we will do all we can to locate and deactivate them.\" Police said the suspects were living in a house that appeared to be in disrepair. A bomb disposal squad set up a cordon around the house and sent people inside for \"emergency bomb search,\" Taylor said. Police said a bomb squad that was dispatched to the north-eastern city of Manchester reported finding a backpack filled with explosives inside the house where the four suspects had been captured. The suspect involved in that blast, which left at least three dead, was shot dead while attempting a break-in at a nearby house.","token_len":387,"entropy":[8.7692,7.8848,3.1355,0.9121,2.2532,2.2919,0.4052,4.4645,3.6044,0.5952,5.7148,6.4696,3.1358,5.1503,4.7988,3.4802,1.1685,2.306,3.8457,4.3629,0.0428,0.0164,2.5757,5.8645,0.0249,0.325,0.5751,5.6282,2.3415,1.8798,0.3481,2.9066,0.7723,4.7019,0.1451,3.9332,0.0376,4.324,1.0035,1.7284,0.8551,0.6439,3.6786,0.2096,0.8775,0.755,4.2057,2.8548,1.3088,0.8456,2.1988,0.8121,5.242,1.0106,0.5732,4.9703,0.162,0.6355,2.673,0.6694,1.3429,2.6932,1.7647,1.5337,2.7152,0.6202,2.1136,0.0053,3.7822,0.8191,5.3772,1.8595,5.7684,3.7087,1.2499,2.898,1.5326,0.019,0.3324,4.0088,0.2162,4.5632,5.3385,5.862,10.2064,2.8547,4.867,1.0998,3.8778,0.0051,4.0768,1.7863,2.306,1.3157,1.0367,9.1136,2.8064,2.1092,4.5268,1.189,5.1127,0.746,0.5379,2.2716,2.5139,0.295,5.7603,2.914,1.5484,1.0473,4.5195,3.2986,3.1243,3.9243,0.0009,0.0002,0.5161,4.9554,0.7951,1.7702,4.0762,0.5631,3.729,1.5393,0.5545,3.9452,2.7752,2.6002,4.5354,1.9212,1.1127,4.5623,5.0047,0.8054,0.0288,8.8917,2.9659,1.199,8.2071,0.0111,4.031,6.1046,2.322,1.2911,2.7746,2.6137,0.4028,4.2265,7.555,1.3611,0.1382,2.7482,4.7625,1.1669,2.8257,6.8548,0.1307,0.0001,0.0002,1.0561,6.3437,0.3155,0.5529,0.5072,2.9979,1.1605,1.3241,2.2845,4.5817,0.063,4.3948,5.0825,0.8046,1.0483,3.0748,4.2474,0.0436,3.2079,2.4117,1.9536,3.4327,4.3169,0.0012,0.9358,2.8289,2.4401,2.7602,3.8861,2.1139,7.6798,0.723,0.6874,4.0806,3.3785,3.2136,0.9966,2.4263,2.1243,3.3158,0.0453,2.7825,3.1991,4.0976,1.7211,5.6833,0.2291,2.0337,1.2873,0.2006,2.6776,1.4645,3.5936,0.4376,3.6975,0.7456,3.5706,2.987,3.1566,4.1376,1.6856,5.2015,2.9097,1.5858,3.0157,2.967,1.8129,4.7914,3.4519,1.6385,0.3211,0.0734,0.0921,1.2978,4.5229,0.272,1.8175,0.0393,3.006,1.9827,0.4239,1.3017,0.8018,3.8593,1.9142,4.2692,2.4653,2.3703,1.0211,0.8515,5.192,3.2245,4.8851,1.3599,6.3925,0.1905,0.905,2.3475,2.0422,4.2625,3.796,1.9917,2.2716,2.8615,1.2215,0.2824,3.0686,2.3733,1.6996,2.4839,3.8157,3.0088,0.114,0.0061,0.1287,2.7754,2.8075,5.1383,0.2103,0.7172,0.8032,2.0599,1.1291,1.3276,2.5962,1.1172,6.1087,0.3079,1.1053,1.6423,3.8393,5.4429,0.2379,0.3684,2.6072,3.8578,0.3648,0.8036,2.7569,3.665,1.071,3.5707,5.5461,0.1124,1.3498,4.0961,0.001,0.499,0.0903,0.909,1.4229,4.6788,3.7827,3.4789,4.4128,5.3655,5.4246,0.0001,9.6148,5.0489,2.3858,1.8431,0.0627,0.0874,2.4541,0.9935,3.2654,2.501,1.4813,5.4193,1.6355,4.1739,0.4665,0.2259,8.2691,1.1461,2.4634,0.0004,2.2161,0.3457,4.2797,5.4767,2.1942,1.8075,5.8112,3.6014,0.0076,1.7804,3.0322,0.9742,0.8958,5.4358,0.7207,4.564,2.8671,2.2308,0.525,5.6182,0.3113,1.533,4.17,7.6696,0.2619,4.304,5.581,1.8824,4.3011,2.722,2.6435,0.0,2.0236,2.37,0.4442,0.8999,5.8459,0.8966,4.4865,3.8145,4.7573,6.695,1.1414,0.0376,1.2826,1.1565,2.6573,3.9372,1.086]}

{"prompt":"Members of U.S. congressional defense committees said on Wednesday they supported a plan for $ 700 billion in defense spending in fiscal year 2018 , backing President Donald Trump \u2019 s call for a boost","text":"Members of U.S. congressional defense committees said on Wednesday they supported a plan for $ 700 billion in defense spending in fiscal year 2018, backing President Donald Trump \u2019 s call for a boost of defense spending after American troops engaged in a deadly attack on a military base in Yemen. According to a report published by the House Armed Services\u2019 Committee, which is chaired by Representative Mark Esper, the American Congress, as well as the current administration, want their members to discuss the budget at a special session starting October 15, 2017. Esper said such a session is needed due to the ongoing debate about the importance of defense expenditures. Esper said that \u201cit is imperative that our troops continue to train, equip, and ready in the face of any escalation in the region,\u201d particularly after two military bases in Saudi Arabia were hit by ballistic missiles. Trump and his aides have repeatedly criticized the Obama administration. In this respect, the US congressional report says that \u201d the White House proposed spending cuts for the Department of Defense by 5,500 million dollars that would have greatly increased the Pentagon\u2019s projected $ 1.2 trillion budget deficit. \u201cIn the same way, Donald Trump wants to add 5,000 soldiers to the defense forces and 10 warships to the fleet. He also stated that he would want the military to send military helicopters to Qatar. \u201cThe report says he intends to propose a temporary budget for an additional 5,000 temporary special workers that can work on military bases and in other operations. \u201cWe can have all these things going at once,\u201d said Esper. Defense Secretary James Mattis also said in his speech before the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday that he would like to spend about 1 trillion to 1.1 trillion dollars in the next decade. Esper said that the American army is prepared for the military threats expected in the coming months, including possible conflicts in Iran or Afghanistan.

{"prompt":"U.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet on Tuesday with the Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives , Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi , to discuss keeping the government open","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet on Tuesday with the Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, to discuss keeping the government open and other issues.\nThe meeting could prove crucial now that President Trump is facing new challenges in his administration due to an ongoing federal government shutdown. Aside from the president's meeting with the leaders of Congress, Trump has been busy with other issues, including the recent withdrawal of the U.S. from the U.N. Security Council and the possibility of increasing tariffs on steel imports.\nTrump had proposed a three-month extension that was not supported by a majority of Democrats, who insisted on the president having the authority to close the government. Trump made a new push Tuesday by saying that he would not offer further support until he met with the Congress.\nPelosi told reporters he would work to find a solution with Trump, according to U.S. network CBS.\nTrump last Friday warned Congress that he would not support a further extension for another 30 days unless Congress offered something \u201cbetter and more fiscally responsible\u201d next Wednesday.\nBut Schumer said Wednesday that he would not consider a three-month extension until the House and Senate reached a compromise. Meanwhile, a recent report by the New York Times showed that a recent proposal by Republican leaders could push back the closure of the government by up to 20 days. The report, however, noted that it might have to wait for the Democrats to put a plan together.\nThe report revealed that Trump has said he would negotiate with the Trump administration on a path forward on a path to close the government to help prevent a potential shutdown. But Congress can only approve such an extension if there is some sort of plan for maintaining the government going forward. But the Republican-led Congress needs a different plan than the Trump administration for an extension to open the government.","token_len":387,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.8114,2.2444,2.8266,3.508,4.6448,2.2511,0.265,3.0822,6.2967,2.828,0.3466,0.8472,3.4387,0.0006,0.0616,0.1017,0.8222,0.5482,0.1622,0.4819,0.0051,1.901,10.1904,0.0022,0.6846,0.5818,0.0001,0.8778,1.001,0.4521,7.9004,0.9565,2.37,0.1872,1.7515,6.6932,0.9059,0.8336,0.4764,15.0692,1.8348,4.176,5.5243,3.5654,8.538,0.238,2.9718,1.0414,1.1428,4.0508,4.6719,2.8983,1.5999,0.9423,2.1274,6.5619,0.0607,4.2724,1.5306,3.7884,4.1677,0.0179,1.0479,10.0088,0.0016,1.2756,3.8982,0.6146,5.4016,0.3704,1.8539,1.9744,0.222,2.6093,0.4331,2.4142,1.4388,3.1087,4.5173,1.8073,1.9383,1.8688,1.2367,0.5028,1.7336,5.7814,6.8872,0.0946,2.1678,0.3542,0.0004,0.0058,0.0064,0.8542,0.2951,6.3109,0.0005,0.1874,0.1992,0.8045,0.0004,0.7629,1.1818,5.1497,0.2728,6.929,3.9574,0.3327,4.0866,2.096,0.4968,0.2406,9.5852,4.1927,5.5588,1.9289,4.7827,0.0466,1.9631,1.4437,5.6676,4.1641,4.6033,4.3505,0.0929,4.3739,0.462,0.1159,2.2248,1.6057,2.4154,6.408,1.8655,2.079,4.5481,4.2852,1.6389,2.6522,0.0805,5.1554,0.3936,0.3299,1.1045,3.4523,5.5197,2.6913,5.2566,4.0878,3.779,4.755,2.1058,1.6342,1.0717,1.0584,2.9994,6.7507,4.5261,3.7141,3.7014,1.6218,4.2029,0.2766,1.6348,6.0578,1.2536,0.2996,5.0297,0.0195,0.0,3.0267,0.6221,5.8616,1.7267,4.868,1.8381,3.2386,0.6734,2.4916,3.1896,0.936,1.9238,5.1103,0.0026,5.5742,0.0766,0.0225,0.0033,8.8023,3.9165,1.5653,0.5727,2.956,5.4933,4.3671,5.5813,3.2278,0.9303,0.8773,0.5607,1.4822,3.8798,1.221,6.8286,1.2246,3.7768,4.7885,4.6943,0.091,3.8631,1.1598,5.5782,5.0198,15.5048,8.9621,8.5225,6.1252,1.1688,7.7508,0.013,0.0002,0.3227,0.7282,8.1247,8.6766,6.216,0.3415,0.8214,4.0524,3.0762,1.1632,3.0995,0.3687,2.2199,1.5145,1.6273,4.6545,1.8202,4.6532,0.0155,0.0586,0.0356,2.2369,1.5211,2.7011,1.4612,0.0396,4.923,0.6079,2.1254,1.3967,7.17,0.0249,3.9563,6.1182,2.2324,1.0857,0.6453,3.3769,0.0585,0.093,2.7169,0.25,3.2361,4.9569,5.3048,1.0796,3.8087,2.5023,3.926,4.8931,3.6349,1.6318,6.8862,0.1975,0.3369,0.4403,2.5905,2.0929,0.0022,3.1886,0.5919,0.4343,3.3178,2.1122,2.9179,2.8459,0.0029,2.845,0.1152,2.9402,4.7387,3.6828,1.7512,0.5209,1.8584,1.3164,5.081,0.2058,4.5187,1.6976,3.3619,2.0374,1.2706,0.2695,2.015,4.0033,6.1833,0.1778,3.3683,1.9353,3.0934,0.9701,0.8542,5.5002,0.9315,1.9567,5.6543,0.965,1.488,1.655,6.2662,3.2446,3.1646,2.8205,5.3952,0.339,4.7398,0.1365,0.1813,4.0708,3.9785,4.4735,1.2604,4.1596,1.4865,0.5845,3.508,5.776,4.4891,1.3704,3.0547,2.8968,2.46,0.3193,0.9252,3.2396,0.3576,3.5919,3.1346,0.0007,5.6018,2.5125,6.374,0.6737,0.5171,5.276,0.041,0.4602,5.8511,2.1377,5.2572,1.4625,0.91,1.6618,4.4673,2.5526,5.6014,2.4596,2.2092,0.9538,4.3747,0.2871,5.1133,4.589,0.856,1.5986,4.8032,0.1114,0.0511,1.0503]}

Now, the state faces the threat of a potential flood like disaster that could easily overwhelm them, and in fact we saw this just the past week in Northern California as the huge landslide left some roads impassable.\nMeanwhile the U.S. congress, facing a looming financial crunch also looks to be on the verge of having its time in office come to an end. House and Senate Majority leaders could face elections by the end of the year. The House Republicans face a huge push on their hand from Tea Party Tea Baggers and Independents. They need to do better than their lame ducks of a chairman to continue to maintain the GOP majority. Now there is talk they could have to deal with a new GOP candidate before they can start to pick and choose who will be their next speaker. The most unlikely one is their current Republican speaker. Newt Gingrich is making himself available to the Republican leadership, but they haven\u2019t yet called him.\nThe senate is also a mess for the GOP and they face a tough challenge if they hope to stay in control. They could lose the balance with two seats in the balance of power, and there could be a lot of money at stake in the GOP primary.\nCongress finally took action on the Affordable Care Act repeal, but it was through a last minute, partisan measure, which will likely backfire, as many Americans will say they don\u2019t care as long as the government does what they want to do and they now know that it doesn\u2019t. It has failed to repeal and replace the Obamacare health care plan. Now it will be up to the White House to bring health care back to America in its proper form \u2013 and with health care for our troops and veterans, as well as all Americans.","token_len":387,"entropy":[10.4621,2.9252,6.2652,0.0925,0.4482,4.3939,0.1882,0.2793,0.1346,1.0069,0.3833,4.5794,1.5721,3.2446,0.1419,0.0241,1.2754,6.3378,1.2615,4.0006,4.2004,5.0919,4.1873,4.2874,1.5993,1.4881,5.6713,6.1832,1.3924,0.7045,7.4609,1.0362,1.7098,1.5004,4.5295,2.5626,3.6485,0.0577,2.2202,4.323,6.2235,7.2793,8.3963,1.8686,0.5957,5.7739,3.2882,6.7506,2.3787,2.1184,4.0673,3.6988,6.4387,5.0189,2.1892,5.6787,4.1555,5.4733,1.1046,1.8505,6.9383,3.4029,3.7795,1.7373,6.552,7.2879,4.8648,4.0391,7.2557,3.9394,0.0362,0.0239,0.6946,0.6437,13.5887,4.0619,4.0282,0.0132,0.0151,0.0221,7.5744,3.5605,5.259,1.2015,3.9819,3.6806,4.1743,8.6856,4.4842,1.4922,0.6432,2.4472,0.3043,1.0915,0.0121,4.1407,2.5963,8.3242,2.3618,4.7429,4.3103,0.0566,0.2185,0.0658,0.4729,4.9453,4.2792,0.0239,4.5077,4.5556,5.4267,3.5241,6.0997,4.1589,1.4954,0.1888,0.002,0.9384,0.3522,1.9941,2.5181,3.1034,4.3525,5.7977,0.8416,5.1802,4.2169,3.2334,1.4244,4.7224,3.6618,5.1028,0.0602,5.3273,9.9805,2.9421,1.8518,6.6648,0.0784,0.0015,2.052,3.2171,3.1021,0.6921,4.1212,2.871,1.1968,3.3712,6.7565,5.3325,4.8327,2.3732,6.7816,2.6975,5.4415,1.0551,5.3348,1.9115,3.5234,1.7998,1.2222,6.3076,4.265,0.9285,3.5238,4.9708,0.8742,3.4399,3.1262,4.6804,0.0346,1.7978,3.6771,3.5484,5.6442,4.7646,1.7396,1.475,3.6198,2.4361,5.124,4.3518,0.0304,2.414,1.8507,1.432,0.779,0.9767,2.3467,0.301,2.9512,4.7043,5.0087,5.0942,1.0331,6.2862,3.3981,3.4685,5.1926,2.6421,7.0773,0.031,1.7439,5.8646,5.7189,3.1543,1.0509,1.7887,3.5632,3.9971,2.5721,1.5935,3.7786,4.6914,16.9703,8.7531,0.7259,3.718,5.4931,1.3023,2.3049,1.6756,2.3269,8.0343,1.4646,1.8195,3.6846,4.5099,4.4169,1.1155,1.1971,2.3715,2.8671,4.1988,0.9794,2.9319,2.4878,5.0759,0.264,5.348,0.0675,4.2953,0.5561,2.4941,1.5462,2.8757,2.7137,2.9359,2.5064,6.0816,5.9121,5.4594,4.3437,1.9873,0.4339,6.9572,0.8072,0.1906,1.5515,1.4249,3.7157,1.9886,0.1817,1.0879,3.5352,0.1269,4.6292,3.5056,0.0128,2.2679,0.9956,3.858,3.9257,0.9068,2.5962,5.7694,6.6652,4.8674,2.5191,1.0192,1.5421,4.8381,0.0011,0.0013,6.5179,2.2395,1.5696,1.6993,2.1371,6.6659,1.4572,6.9889,0.4703,4.961,4.6166,5.488,2.8609,2.3698,3.9473,2.5603,6.0351,0.0086,2.9544,2.1061,2.8657,3.9571,2.376,4.824,2.3746,2.4029,1.5662,0.4242,0.2263,1.8275,4.2081,2.1929,0.0311,1.6983,3.0672,3.3318,2.2267,1.7588,0.5834,2.518,0.2486,2.9042,2.3535,6.973,3.8853,1.7786,2.6902,2.7307,0.5488,0.2296,0.0262,2.9612,3.1497,3.5676,4.7961,0.9258,2.399,2.6258,0.4018,1.0935,4.4159,4.3135,0.4096,4.101,1.5936,4.228,2.3047,2.5827,1.5168,0.4754,0.0186,0.6491,4.1552,0.0017,0.5657,3.9204,4.8407,0.1584,0.7884,0.7074,3.3912,4.6128,3.2904,5.9667,0.5838,6.2959,2.2948,3.6156,5.2019,0.1892,4.235,5.3061,5.7262,1.3467,1.8911,2.8882,2.9682,0.3005,0.0444,4.5791,1.222,1.4719]}

And that is not just talking about internal issues or security. We are also working with the global community to confront these problems.\"\n\"Against radical violence and extremism, against Islamophobia across the continent, that will demand united Germany, united Europe and a united voice,\" said Merkel, who led her party to a surprise victory in a federal election in September and hopes to stay in power for another four years as Chancellor.\nAngela Merkel said a united Germany would help tackle the Islamic State group that threatens Europe with terrorism, and that the EU cannot simply sit back in defence.\n\"I don't believe that because there is a danger we will be able to take action in our own way if we are not united,\" she said.\nThe Chancellor said the next four years would be \"extraordinary times\" for Germany and Europe.\n\"Now we face the test of our unity in the fight against terrorism and extremism and we have the opportunity to show, how we work both together and how we stand on our own.\n\"How are we prepared, how are we fighting terrorism? And this is not our problem only, it is a problem that we face in the European Union and the world, but one that requires joint European response and a united Germany.\"","token_len":388,"entropy":[9.8523,4.6478,0.001,11.3212,3.8743,0.0212,6.1918,0.5407,1.7094,5.6904,0.2043,1.1918,12.6323,0.5282,1.5823,5.574,2.9509,3.2418,6.3456,0.1594,1.1573,5.8314,1.8308,1.378,4.2146,0.5507,1.3956,5.3018,0.5102,3.7848,1.3056,6.1232,3.0332,8.2291,0.8335,1.1395,3.1099,7.4476,1.4523,0.4746,15.5371,2.2837,0.0026,3.088,4.16,2.6627,2.9354,1.2806,5.9644,3.2122,0.9237,1.3447,2.2881,0.8336,1.4437,1.0672,1.7092,0.2087,0.01,1.1898,2.3056,4.2983,5.7866,4.9456,0.0696,0.9447,2.979,0.1118,5.6913,0.2403,0.685,2.1817,2.4432,4.8258,3.4054,4.9841,2.5748,1.5314,2.6628,3.2154,3.0388,3.8256,2.6532,6.9372,2.7961,1.5321,1.7173,0.0996,2.2746,1.852,0.1041,0.0846,1.1768,0.2326,2.3734,5.6281,1.2143,0.1959,5.4706,3.1227,1.6977,6.7042,1.6724,3.8118,3.2542,6.146,0.2774,2.1835,1.62,6.441,5.4034,5.6355,0.8274,3.1938,8.4427,3.8752,1.3058,2.4243,3.2931,1.4373,0.859,5.96,0.4815,3.8562,2.6318,1.6507,0.2012,2.7454,0.4709,0.6564,3.8653,2.1117,2.3313,1.5106,2.6119,1.7148,0.8527,2.5948,3.4306,6.8286,0.1101,7.5588,3.8951,3.9959,4.7335,1.2746,2.1146,2.0589,2.029,6.2893,2.3673,1.2129,6.0854,0.1509,1.2667,6.2754,3.2647,1.759,1.7855,0.1061,4.0391,8.4614,5.9173,7.8749,2.1302,2.2031,0.5653,5.4572,4.1539,0.4382,8.1028,1.312,2.0434,0.4014,4.6964,4.5551,6.8301,6.0108,5.3224,2.2717,4.2496,0.585,1.7534,1.8946,1.1929,7.621,1.6174,4.0946,0.6653,1.1959,0.8557,4.7089,3.4151,1.6715,1.7229,1.5118,5.6778,0.9209,0.3234,3.2437,3.8091,0.162,1.2712,2.3733,4.042,4.6505,0.3053,5.532,0.4282,0.6788,1.2669,1.5743,1.5716,0.0979,4.6106,2.1325,0.4039,0.1963,5.9017,0.0266,0.0461,4.56,4.269,2.0566,0.3673,1.0464,2.5754,4.3518,1.1882,4.4669,0.0346,3.5957,4.8319,3.9885,1.1517,4.0455,4.4637,1.511,2.0056,2.1975,1.8779,3.2024,6.6025,4.2463,3.9163,0.62,4.778,8.2331,3.9855,0.9503,1.0897,2.9852,2.9045,0.0009,2.6787,0.7659,6.7648,3.4886,0.6493,1.2713,6.6512,3.4695,1.782,1.9041,1.8625,0.0199,3.5866,2.5644,2.7079,3.3469,0.709,2.8548,4.4851,0.309,1.9387,0.6907,2.1401,1.3442,0.2033,0.454,0.3768,0.5347,2.1821,4.1812,1.3303,1.8445,5.5511,3.7436,0.0996,1.1066,0.5355,1.7664,5.7645,0.2544,5.6069,1.0068,0.7488,0.5993,1.9997,1.8916,1.169,0.3983,1.2457,5.077,1.8016,4.7016,1.438,6.9438,0.1576,2.3351,8.2513,3.1335,1.395,4.2018,0.0677,0.7631,1.7187,1.5216,2.7837,1.9187,2.0242,3.7195,1.5082,0.1757,3.8261,5.4958,5.555,1.7172,5.399,8.8143,1.5051,0.8505,2.3097,0.121,4.7142,3.9848,2.6611,0.7707,2.8493,2.4049,0.3683,6.0269,4.2939,0.082,3.3152,2.7823,1.1068,0.848,0.013,5.8291,2.2896,1.8013,1.8714,3.8438,0.4438,1.9798,5.5143,3.8216,5.3771,2.37,1.1128,0.3565,3.1469,2.3017,2.2627,1.3934,1.7066,2.0096,1.3091,2.8153,0.1651,1.712,1.7855,2.0001,2.9541,4.3129,4.6889,0.3467,4.657,6.0629,4.4965,5.5901,2.2771,2.0721,1.4684,0.7941,1.0292]}

Then we\u2019ll explain how CBD oil is used in the body and what it can do on its own and even with other supplements.\nBefore we dive into the more specific parts of CBD oil, let\u2019s take a look at what CBD really is. It\u2019s a short acronym for the plant-derived compound cannabidiol, but it can also refer to a different extract.\nCannabis-derived CBD oil has a broad range of uses, so the main component that determines the effects of the oil varies depending on the product. This may be one of the reasons CBD oil is a relatively new supplement.\nOne of the major differences between CBD oil and hemp oil is the plant origin. CBD oil is derived from the cannabis or hemp plant. This means that each product contains a different proportion of terpenoids, flavonoids, phytocannabinoids, and more.\nYou\u2019d be surprised to learn that while a bottle of CBD oil can have hundreds of different compounds in it, several compounds dominate the oil. The most prominent is CBD, which can range from about 50 to 89% of the total oil.\nOther compounds, even though they are present in lower quantities, still have powerful effects on the body. One of the main terpenoids is CBN, which is sometimes called the cannabis version of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.\nIt\u2019s not always possible to distinguish hemp and marijuana products by smell alone because THC can be extracted from either plant. However, it is a good idea to pay attention to the label for potential THC content.","token_len":390,"entropy":[10.9507,0.0111,3.4101,1.738,2.0385,5.7294,6.636,1.1982,5.5991,2.1318,0.2467,6.0326,0.9433,1.576,5.0839,6.9996,6.433,7.4509,4.1043,4.6166,2.8121,2.8984,1.1701,3.1575,5.8245,0.0013,0.898,5.1351,1.7468,1.6338,5.1729,0.6129,9.2484,3.6585,1.1207,1.1177,3.3685,0.0003,7.1568,1.5963,1.266,3.3512,0.5759,1.4042,3.4196,1.9031,5.8002,0.1013,13.5417,1.9286,12.3088,2.2996,6.2328,3.6532,6.0448,0.9218,5.8969,3.4898,0.0459,17.784,3.2583,2.575,6.7276,0.4232,19.1377,8.8483,2.3165,4.7448,1.8168,4.0798,0.5536,1.0201,2.2716,1.5219,1.6071,7.2766,1.8691,3.0354,1.55,2.6372,0.2948,5.6883,2.5697,0.0539,3.0423,6.2094,4.9393,1.7544,6.888,0.5997,1.713,6.1117,0.7193,4.9197,0.3553,0.9202,4.2775,3.3843,3.5038,0.3077,1.7238,0.3994,0.5941,1.5866,4.2954,0.7675,1.4236,2.1162,0.104,0.6009,0.0644,2.331,5.1122,6.2277,0.7875,0.7405,2.7023,2.2601,0.0925,0.6096,0.7955,7.3463,6.0219,0.6146,2.1305,4.0177,4.8277,1.3646,3.677,3.8624,0.0046,0.0383,0.0001,1.5658,5.3301,1.3719,3.9648,1.0568,3.9508,0.0201,1.889,4.368,5.8683,2.65,1.5849,0.9885,3.1043,1.5905,5.8285,0.8664,0.6393,1.4756,2.6956,1.8321,4.1796,1.3396,0.0605,1.237,1.2022,5.0592,3.3362,3.163,5.8331,2.2979,6.655,1.8516,5.2367,1.0518,2.6683,2.5874,4.7996,2.1134,0.0512,0.81,3.7197,1.1791,4.0577,4.1912,1.8741,4.2717,0.3755,0.1088,1.9709,4.2081,0.5883,0.6709,3.6492,4.8873,1.7838,5.249,1.6753,1.1846,3.8254,0.5406,0.0613,3.5213,2.8973,0.4329,0.3469,0.4077,0.0672,5.9854,1.1547,0.2631,1.3151,5.0351,5.7423,1.0879,1.7055,0.2788,0.7739,2.3066,0.0466,1.1574,2.7438,7.2608,1.2566,0.7995,1.4004,2.7815,0.9327,0.5546,5.9768,4.3866,1.8587,1.3902,1.5127,5.5885,0.0168,8.7532,0.034,1.5952,1.2248,3.7149,0.1585,0.0164,0.4726,4.2348,0.1501,2.1738,0.16,0.0471,0.5049,0.8926,5.1867,0.4589,1.2171,5.3871,4.9312,0.3019,4.8383,1.7372,3.5027,1.0072,1.069,0.1047,5.3172,4.4764,7.6506,0.1844,0.7553,0.2014,2.432,2.9432,5.2158,0.0943,1.115,3.775,2.3425,0.099,0.1821,7.2256,4.6454,8.0415,0.5016,3.9464,0.9568,2.5282,1.9983,3.3179,1.9446,3.9453,2.7366,0.4703,3.4826,5.5321,0.1994,5.7769,2.6932,1.2776,7.3625,1.8076,2.025,0.4731,1.2253,3.0709,1.3188,0.8833,5.6446,2.2303,3.5535,6.71,3.0283,0.6983,0.9424,5.1687,0.3046,7.5751,2.7405,0.7905,3.9843,1.9219,5.4549,0.7115,1.0562,0.5477,0.5054,0.645,3.0862,0.4901,0.2424,2.3323,7.376,0.0932,0.1321,2.785,4.579,1.4737,0.6194,0.565,0.6235,6.5422,1.5876,1.1954,6.4552,8.8242,0.0851,1.0635,1.7086,1.2207,1.7727,0.1276,0.1718,1.0081,0.1904,1.4659,3.8517,0.9143,0.0331,0.0184,3.1992,3.7296,3.0353,0.1134,3.8989,7.6411,2.7125,6.4828,3.7744,2.7086,5.8002,3.0259,5.1824,3.8048,3.1015,0.9831,5.0598,0.5169,4.8832,1.4264,0.7037,2.5353,0.0406,2.4618,1.4123,3.6226,2.8384,0.9662,0.0484,6.952,0.867,0.1175,0.7565,7.3051,3.0844,7.2123,3.9622,2.3236,1.0792]}

In the end it is a question of politics, I think it has to be taken this way,\u201d said a German government source.","token_len":390,"entropy":[9.8851,1.7617,0.0003,4.626,7.7712,1.5671,2.2269,0.1307,1.8603,2.3042,0.472,2.2658,1.8533,4.7194,1.7911,6.6217,0.1189,1.104,3.7912,0.1097,5.7028,4.4131,8.7415,0.8583,0.9747,1.7056,0.3124,0.9265,0.6161,3.7697,1.0454,0.0007,1.1524,7.3825,4.9939,2.8671,0.4418,0.1264,14.2222,2.7043,2.1206,2.4229,0.3161,2.5714,3.4502,0.5433,2.8307,2.994,0.094,2.9671,6.0798,0.0593,2.0196,1.7839,0.0978,2.3724,0.1229,1.4752,0.186,4.8327,2.9966,3.4323,3.9662,0.1393,2.8452,5.6832,0.0093,0.6528,4.3206,16.0606,7.157,5.2512,5.7555,1.322,7.6096,6.996,5.6511,1.4296,6.1391,0.9679,2.5568,2.1923,0.3045,0.4021,6.0893,4.3552,3.8009,4.6153,0.9294,3.247,4.1343,3.6915,1.7902,8.2501,1.7752,2.0784,2.4118,1.5536,1.2284,3.1462,2.2149,0.6623,4.2874,1.5472,1.478,1.9522,1.4566,1.5953,7.7983,1.7946,5.1807,1.2103,1.5809,2.753,1.893,6.0207,2.8097,4.166,2.9783,1.7747,4.1448,5.5551,8.46,4.945,1.0896,2.5758,3.212,2.4669,1.0077,0.8691,3.8769,0.3188,2.245,2.9499,2.0302,0.5209,2.3316,4.1714,7.9549,7.9925,3.451,7.6995,1.5211,0.3403,0.2244,2.0636,5.2942,4.317,3.5389,2.7995,1.3909,2.099,3.4002,3.5982,4.5121,3.8253,3.777,0.9524,2.3147,3.6647,1.4488,1.3159,5.1928,0.144,4.9336,3.2891,4.9483,4.3932,1.1917,0.29,6.417,6.4153,2.5552,5.1669,6.8145,4.3879,1.5558,0.457,3.9477,6.6853,4.3937,0.0016,6.445,0.7949,4.2702,0.9746,0.302,0.2169,1.7276,0.4517,4.8865,3.5125,3.7167,0.4077,1.4806,0.8436,0.3074,8.9971,2.7466,5.7003,0.0039,2.8939,2.4626,5.2652,1.8879,2.8341,0.4761,2.8806,3.7136,2.4786,2.1759,1.1392,5.7124,5.6434,5.4167,4.9627,0.0056,0.2315,1.506,1.3575,1.6149,2.6198,1.7791,11.3366,1.5976,0.015,2.6264,6.8655,1.7855,2.7935,1.4429,0.7449,3.3261,0.5721,0.0512,2.3159,8.9611,10.4047,5.2948,4.7509,8.8669,0.8545,1.017,3.4252,1.5312,0.971,1.0293,0.4431,6.4619,7.9392,4.7506,3.0335,0.5149,2.1709,0.5086,4.1078,1.4076,0.2867,4.8915,2.9213,0.0158,12.9273,0.1881,3.5699,7.5255,0.0271,3.8588,6.0954,0.6213,3.1378,3.3884,4.5774,2.3721,4.7919,0.2878,1.9999,2.1134,5.1496,2.0962,6.4075,4.3081,0.596,5.846,1.3867,5.2089,0.1176,0.9118,3.4422,0.717,0.4747,4.5108,5.2005,3.241,2.2494,3.5137,5.9077,1.1912,1.8545,3.9707,2.1349,6.2653,5.4107,1.6361,3.9507,1.3434,0.4731,2.5958,0.5252,4.3461,2.8611,0.1361,3.8041,4.838,1.0964,0.4305,2.0605,0.4148,1.4717,7.5037,0.7069,5.6651,5.6252,3.621,2.5161,1.9792,6.404,0.0897,1.2755,4.3229,0.1613,5.32,1.9475,2.3921,4.5449,2.9181,0.5565,0.1352,1.8189,2.148,4.243,2.663,4.6418,2.3063,1.806,2.0437,3.3226,6.2339,3.4801,1.5292,1.3644,3.0598,3.372,5.7488,6.238,4.4679,3.8254,4.4211,3.9133,1.2912,6.4344,1.1604,4.5407,1.6667,2.1003,2.2702,0.6109,3.2594,2.1054,0.0812,5.7364,1.8149,6.8243,1.6086,2.8639,4.2706,0.2829,0.381,5.0179,6.7681,0.1312,2.3061,0.3292,0.7017,2.2547,2.694,1.7342,2.6333,2.2779,0.578]}

France's exports of weapons to Israel, while banned under European sanctions and multilateral agreements, had reached $7 billion for the country, representing an 11 percent share of the country's military budget of $35 billion, according to figures compiled by the German newspaper Handelsblatt. On Monday, an Israeli official said a new deal - worth $300 million - that included six more F-35 fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and helicopters would be concluded during a visit by the head of French defense, Florence Parly, to Israel at the end of the week. At a news conference with his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, Parly said France was the most important European defense partner of Israel and it was time to stop undercutting European partners. \"The sanctions (against Israel) are not going to change the reality that we have a security relationship of great importance with Israel,\" Parly said. \"We want that the European community have a more important role for us in this relationship.\" Gabriel said it was important in the European-Israeli relationship that both sides were equal partners. \"The French and the German are European partners and the Israeli relations will only be better with these two European partners,\" Gabriel said. Both Parly and Gabriel stressed the importance of the Paris climate accord, the global accord sought to curb greenhouse gas pollution, which entered into force on Friday. \"The time has come for the US (U.S.) to go back on its way,\" Gabriel said. \"They must sign and respect it, and France will follow them.\"\nThe United States has been trying for a decade to persuade Congress to remove Iran from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, according to senior U.S. administration officials and other diplomats and scholars interviewed by The Associated Press.","token_len":390,"entropy":[4.2171,6.0035,0.5347,6.4682,3.735,2.6427,3.9519,7.076,6.192,0.0465,1.9767,0.0766,2.0246,8.9332,0.9467,0.6077,3.6868,7.0891,5.8825,9.5145,0.0016,1.8205,1.1628,0.9317,1.583,3.7701,2.3005,2.5079,2.1072,2.5485,1.6984,0.388,0.9471,1.9859,0.0911,4.7866,2.2684,6.6032,1.2346,4.0255,1.3938,5.7203,2.5437,5.8557,6.76,2.8611,3.8119,3.1466,5.1325,8.8017,0.0529,2.1859,0.3376,4.5312,3.9434,1.022,3.8773,1.0313,3.9595,0.8376,4.368,2.3579,8.0437,2.5022,2.816,0.4962,3.8002,0.1899,1.6378,1.6731,0.0075,4.2527,0.9301,6.6641,0.747,4.9982,0.1756,1.4921,1.5678,0.0008,3.5563,2.1568,0.0522,1.26,4.0819,2.0025,5.5111,0.0091,0.0015,0.0083,0.1872,5.8452,2.8729,0.1638,4.7893,1.1455,2.2239,0.9391,3.3553,3.6143,1.642,7.8728,3.4538,0.673,4.5946,0.0836,0.6461,5.986,4.6772,6.0881,5.6837,5.2376,0.0572,1.4422,1.2364,0.0435,2.6973,8.4612,1.8124,0.3088,3.5814,1.1937,0.6408,5.1326,5.0831,2.5804,1.6719,1.6053,1.7976,5.0331,0.001,4.2987,1.8082,2.4797,12.3416,5.0888,4.9182,1.0569,0.6402,1.2081,5.2603,0.3704,0.2011,0.0011,1.6251,2.4011,0.2074,5.3556,1.8651,1.5026,0.0652,2.5145,3.2583,4.073,0.0492,0.4284,5.8815,0.0002,0.0,0.0929,2.813,0.0012,0.8886,1.4595,1.9281,5.8783,3.311,1.7697,3.6471,4.0189,0.6249,3.4665,1.9225,1.4077,4.8024,1.1326,3.9909,0.6936,4.7525,7.01,0.4743,5.2266,4.1427,1.135,0.9915,2.3215,7.6306,5.3018,1.0199,0.5334,0.0665,1.0319,2.2824,2.7986,0.1104,4.0674,1.5167,3.1951,3.1772,1.5168,1.8163,2.172,4.453,1.5734,5.7695,4.7187,0.3884,1.3342,0.8577,0.6815,1.5869,0.0014,0.2687,0.4681,0.9844,1.3572,3.3767,5.7744,5.287,2.8019,4.0783,6.2971,1.1088,4.0983,4.2698,0.792,3.8407,1.5555,1.5909,2.0394,2.883,0.9398,4.6371,1.0933,3.9344,0.3747,2.1122,5.9397,1.5991,4.0308,6.252,0.839,1.3628,1.8875,4.3263,0.8099,3.4857,7.5037,0.9824,1.235,0.7333,2.1229,3.836,1.7766,0.7395,1.0268,2.9185,6.9411,0.9261,1.8518,2.6443,2.7403,7.0112,4.0198,4.5881,2.1378,2.4062,3.679,4.5589,0.6105,3.552,0.3213,0.9092,1.9696,0.1557,0.3839,6.1461,4.8533,0.0027,0.0842,0.2498,3.2622,1.7485,0.4619,0.041,2.0271,3.8623,4.5833,1.1297,1.2631,3.1612,5.5284,2.9897,7.8575,0.3917,2.1432,0.4647,0.3645,4.724,2.0446,2.0976,8.6069,0.0951,0.0068,1.3327,3.1338,0.4427,1.8444,1.7841,7.0941,0.8006,0.0735,0.8222,1.3972,5.8568,4.9501,4.0736,0.0061,0.0594,0.205,0.5749,4.6283,2.6717,2.0842,0.4172,6.3976,1.7113,1.2957,0.11,0.349,1.0606,4.5468,2.9766,6.5471,4.5422,5.5521,2.6996,2.0591,1.4562,4.8364,2.6174,3.8216,3.4256,0.726,2.6874,6.0959,3.5861,0.2015,1.7195,2.0133,3.6984,2.8729,3.1705,1.1038,0.0299,3.0704,6.8279,0.2723,5.6159,4.2076,0.6095,2.0742,3.3271,0.0231,3.1884,0.018,0.0434,0.0392,1.1175,5.6364,0.0019,5.0523,1.4146,0.0004,0.0165,0.0015,2.9336,0.0436,2.3283,3.8968,3.552,3.8008,6.429,4.9917,0.6088,1.0566,1.5281,0.0016,0.534]}

This is very true of China,\" Trump said of his new strategy for international trade.","token_len":391,"entropy":[7.9562,7.9162,1.0676,2.3954,1.941,4.7112,8.2462,1.4506,2.5507,1.5802,0.0372,3.058,1.4323,6.1363,1.229,0.0036,4.807,6.7507,0.0127,1.8448,6.5071,1.3211,2.9839,0.0029,0.042,0.0282,0.2933,0.3596,0.0112,7.2571,0.2298,2.0365,2.5134,5.8278,0.2824,0.3122,2.7374,6.7032,3.6514,3.8098,3.4525,3.9262,6.2366,4.4765,0.0912,3.5228,2.5695,5.8309,1.0727,7.7026,0.9326,0.1353,11.0133,3.7102,2.512,0.3362,1.657,0.0005,0.0007,0.041,7.0409,6.6601,1.5015,7.9762,1.34,7.1679,3.0873,0.3551,2.0307,5.2236,1.7205,3.0157,1.5371,4.9063,2.9818,1.7057,5.2625,3.9928,0.08,2.6683,0.9005,0.0548,4.0013,2.6132,7.4292,1.6869,7.8729,2.8629,5.7105,1.417,10.2712,0.0288,0.008,5.4467,1.2909,3.2275,0.1651,0.1166,0.5792,1.1382,0.0986,0.005,0.0019,0.5689,3.0231,0.32,3.6807,1.2609,2.6656,0.8872,0.1961,4.4864,4.6136,3.1297,3.3449,0.4037,4.6542,2.2374,3.2125,3.2965,3.6566,1.8118,5.4381,0.4187,3.8543,0.5275,6.9664,1.925,2.3179,0.705,1.7167,2.0908,1.5928,2.3854,0.9744,0.1389,4.6102,1.2879,0.0012,0.029,0.6846,2.0899,1.7747,0.5358,3.0776,3.3591,2.9402,0.9572,0.6058,1.844,5.8106,8.6789,0.0048,0.9198,0.8789,1.9622,0.0003,0.0035,0.0121,8.8844,3.1686,6.1732,0.4164,1.928,2.3828,2.5413,3.5702,3.9192,2.7482,0.4251,1.4521,2.9742,1.9747,0.2304,3.4291,2.4483,0.0024,0.0018,0.2593,8.7351,2.122,0.483,5.8748,3.5376,0.0006,0.0037,0.0615,5.8342,0.3308,5.3219,3.4893,6.2743,4.5829,1.5385,0.0042,2.5733,2.2505,5.0724,3.3412,3.0859,3.9283,4.4367,0.354,5.8218,3.686,0.8191,0.3893,4.4606,1.0117,0.1619,1.5958,1.8858,2.2206,1.1256,0.0005,0.0029,0.0429,3.2889,3.6584,3.5774,0.3539,6.6826,3.6606,4.5546,5.8269,0.2708,1.6768,1.1887,4.2298,5.2062,1.5893,0.0597,0.7506,0.3773,0.6915,1.464,6.4008,1.9004,4.5913,4.2518,2.6792,1.4884,3.3448,0.6975,0.122,2.0721,2.1348,5.647,4.927,3.1304,1.4992,2.7594,3.5043,1.1966,2.5356,1.1438,1.0654,0.1254,1.1877,0.4441,0.2211,2.4172,1.9693,0.5911,6.1605,2.8651,3.3045,1.5579,4.9908,3.5682,6.9782,9.1753,2.6287,4.1176,0.8528,6.7605,2.7069,1.9752,3.0962,0.584,2.287,5.3803,2.3271,0.4477,3.0314,6.1127,1.4056,0.6143,0.3149,1.5426,2.0536,1.2537,1.224,0.8656,5.8961,1.0552,1.47,3.2155,1.3718,2.669,1.9271,5.9018,2.071,6.3912,0.967,3.8152,3.7977,3.2656,0.0278,5.3583,2.0247,4.0172,2.1229,0.3517,3.1807,6.5848,0.3079,1.3378,3.6443,5.8192,3.5941,3.8764,3.5885,7.0591,2.02,3.8252,3.315,0.055,1.3468,0.3771,4.4743,2.7701,4.3858,8.4275,0.1916,5.7605,0.608,0.1969,2.2095,1.8952,1.887,2.5789,1.421,6.3297,2.0516,3.0148,0.1992,3.7242,5.3354,7.1004,0.4254,4.8915,0.0003,1.9599,0.9896,1.0169,0.3665,0.1623,1.8073,4.6979,0.9533,0.0088,0.5111,0.4544,3.8937,6.8159,1.5202,2.9822,0.7074,5.3534,1.2192,4.0071,1.7473,4.7914,0.3351,4.1793,5.0884,3.1413,1.4443,1.5712,1.4682,0.7389,2.1861,2.6367,3.5701,1.9868,3.0661,4.3907,0.1817,0.3876]}

Trump\u2019s comments came after the two sides could not agree on an outcome of their last round of nuclear talks in Singapore.\nKim had earlier warned Trump not to get his hopes up about a meeting as both sides continued to make progress in their nuclear talks. Kim told Trump that North Korea is looking to have a summit with the United States before the end of the year, but that he needed it to be a win-win situation.\nTrump\u2019s comments Sunday did not change these expectations, as it was unclear whether the latest talks had resulted in either side agreeing to go forward with meeting the other\u2019s demands. Instead, Trump said that he hoped for further progress in an upcoming visit to Asia this year.\nHe has already suggested that next year would be a good year to try to see both sides in their own countries, despite his comments last week that he wanted the summit in New York and not Pyongyang. It is not clear, however, whether the two sides are trying to make a deal or hold talks as another one in a year rather than in one in the immediate future.\nIt seems that Trump was looking through the report and discussing details. On Tuesday, Trump said that there are multiple possibilities for a summit with Kim.

{"prompt":"Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus traditional birthplace in Bethlehem on Wednesday night in protest at U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital . A Christmas tree adorned","text":"Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus traditional birthplace in Bethlehem on Wednesday night in protest at U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. A Christmas tree adorned with Palestinian flags was lit at the church, while a car of anti-Trump protesters, who were dressed in black, drove to the church around 10 p.m. local time. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital in an August 15 Jerusalem declaration, days after he took office and amid mounting criticism of the move, with many prominent diplomats condemning the move and most regional nations saying they would follow the U.S., except for the United Arab Emirates, which recognizes Israel. During Trump s campaign, he had called the city the capital of Israel and threatened to recognize it if elected. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday denounced Trump s move and called it a \u201cgrave violation of the rights of Palestinian people and its legitimate national aspirations,\u201d among other things. Trump last Friday signed the declaration that announced Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, days before making the announcement. During a State of the Union address on Friday, Trump said he was only acting on Jerusalem because \u201cit is the eternal truth that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and this is how it has always been and it will always be.\u201d At the announcement, the United States, along with the World Bank, European Union and regional nations, agreed to grant Jerusalem the status of an international city. During a recent visit to Israel, Trump said he planned to give the location its modern-day capital designation. \u201cMany countries in the world, including many in the European Union, accept Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump told Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem on Monday. \u201cAnd as our first act in office, and based on a number of other countries recognizing Jerusalem as an international city, we will do the same thing,\u201d he said.","token_len":392,"entropy":[5.0531,0.2038,10.4458,4.4434,8.4387,0.0683,2.0514,9.9579,12.2203,7.6764,1.8515,5.578,1.8056,2.3009,2.6961,3.7374,1.4057,1.5709,6.1644,0.0319,0.2238,0.1594,0.3345,0.0785,0.0029,10.0452,2.7738,0.1213,1.1596,0.3118,0.0104,2.0642,12.7165,0.0748,0.3773,4.0098,8.3319,1.3573,6.4581,0.0534,5.3903,0.1682,0.714,2.3399,3.0136,0.5888,5.3858,1.8856,3.159,1.8224,5.4354,4.1818,5.3413,0.0261,0.7594,1.1953,4.2633,2.4249,1.7937,3.9151,0.3425,2.3433,0.6098,2.3074,3.2933,0.4947,2.3646,7.3723,2.5282,0.8033,0.0006,0.0002,0.2903,3.344,0.0017,0.7185,4.9009,7.232,0.2248,0.1368,0.4182,0.2738,0.0132,2.6865,2.9274,6.7093,3.8945,4.6905,7.0616,1.3458,7.1415,0.3338,2.3014,3.0807,0.1184,2.8105,4.9869,3.3897,1.6577,1.0667,1.5519,2.9368,2.5372,3.8084,2.065,7.2877,7.389,3.9951,0.8129,0.5772,2.2082,6.4636,6.7354,4.4069,4.2,1.078,1.7409,4.0519,1.8976,0.8821,0.0004,0.0186,5.0712,9.8774,1.1988,1.8483,1.1011,1.9127,0.0019,1.3261,0.4867,4.7579,1.3879,1.0953,5.7228,4.0464,3.4138,4.7619,0.3256,1.6385,3.544,2.0368,1.7821,4.2502,2.5031,0.6764,0.0477,0.7495,1.2669,4.9159,0.4072,4.17,1.381,1.9185,2.6159,0.7071,4.4679,1.1703,0.0064,0.0002,5.1984,3.2131,4.354,1.1348,3.3639,2.0932,1.7543,1.3913,1.8131,1.2282,19.1508,6.2414,10.4274,1.5111,0.4907,1.5659,3.7012,0.1093,2.333,1.5511,2.3843,4.6317,6.5311,5.3016,2.1545,2.7732,7.7833,7.3458,7.5363,0.622,1.0786,0.1248,2.8022,5.934,4.4181,1.8168,3.0074,6.1919,3.328,6.2951,1.2887,0.2673,0.7413,0.1048,0.0497,0.246,1.4248,7.6746,1.9109,5.8276,1.2035,1.5276,1.4029,4.8815,1.7873,5.796,0.1307,0.02,0.0203,0.0896,1.6903,2.2735,0.176,0.6392,1.0291,1.5241,1.8773,7.1428,5.021,2.2486,7.3508,4.0783,8.4931,1.252,1.9338,0.6962,1.2485,5.9349,9.742,2.404,2.9584,0.6677,0.4431,0.4094,0.0475,1.0215,1.1233,4.7102,0.875,5.2173,1.8551,4.0716,0.5784,0.0781,2.5653,2.682,1.1807,0.4553,0.1302,1.2395,3.776,1.457,4.129,0.7241,6.2791,0.5885,3.0622,2.6659,0.2083,3.4169,3.1782,0.0004,2.0407,7.207,0.1926,0.5182,5.1332,0.0572,0.7781,5.9285,3.1669,0.3063,3.755,0.4083,6.6155,1.9976,1.8753,0.2905,0.2245,2.5559,4.497,1.9596,1.1901,5.3702,1.7384,5.725,1.2222,0.1824,1.6969,0.1898,0.5848,1.3154,1.3283,4.9841,0.0468,4.6375,1.3021,7.1671,4.6949,8.0288,4.4319,0.0362,3.4012,4.5337,1.147,5.7934,1.6786,5.4394,2.733,2.1504,0.173,2.3939,1.8239,0.2203,3.6798,2.0937,0.5429,4.4528,0.0164,0.5132,7.4923,1.4073,7.2267,0.7983,0.3798,0.0464,0.2715,1.7944,3.3055,0.8003,5.5246,2.4522,4.8572,3.6813,0.8326,0.0004,0.0001,0.0,0.0,2.3152,2.5857,0.8087,1.9384,0.4441,3.3971,0.3396,4.3097,3.9739,5.0608,6.2118,5.4466,1.6362,5.5321,0.6434,4.6166,7.1242,0.0993,3.3042,3.6047,0.0075,4.937,4.5493,6.4314,0.7017,0.6291,2.6431,0.4499,0.1694,0.2448,0.6614,0.8028,3.0982,3.0568,0.4131,3.5016,2.3155,1.5193,0.7245,1.4583,0.3477,0.2353]}

But today a regime change in Iran is unlikely, analysts say.\nAnalyst and expert Dr John Delury said: \" Iran still has nuclear fuel, that is to say they have not yet discovered a route out of the nuclear arms race that we know of.\n\" Today, the US intelligence community is confident that anything Iran might be planning in Syria today would be very difficult to carry out, and they may not even be very efficient.\n\" They haven't found any new secret facilities in Syria, even if they did, they'd probably not be the secretive operations that they've got going in other countries, and I think they wouldn't have the personnel. In my view, anything that Iran might be planning within Syria doesn t look very likely to work.\"\nHe added: \"I wouldn t think it would be very sophisticated, but Iran has its intelligence network operating across the Middle East. It's not a secret network, it's very active, and its people have had a lot of experience operating in Syria.\n\"But at the same time Iran's people wouldn't be prepared to operate outside of Syria.\n\" I'd be very surprised if they had any specific plans to go and engage in Syria, and I'd be surprised that they know how to carry out those plans.\"","token_len":392,"entropy":[8.278,9.7655,7.9321,2.1721,0.6604,6.5138,5.3597,5.7629,1.7122,3.4859,2.1269,4.3158,3.9985,3.2096,0.7748,3.4258,1.0091,2.1748,4.2328,7.9995,2.7897,0.8099,1.7248,5.449,0.004,8.1474,0.8307,0.1666,2.1025,11.3616,6.8564,4.5994,0.9265,6.6903,0.0066,8.4607,0.9327,3.1735,1.3451,0.1771,0.9424,17.1678,2.2156,5.3556,0.3361,3.314,0.5359,1.5872,3.6278,4.612,0.3049,1.7048,3.1539,2.9668,1.0789,0.5,1.2536,3.0223,2.8682,1.4048,3.7052,2.9536,5.6766,5.6057,0.7878,5.3667,0.4837,4.9446,0.5829,1.4002,6.5703,1.9375,9.387,1.3411,2.7807,3.3673,0.6063,4.8533,7.3384,0.5451,4.464,1.8014,1.6547,3.1679,4.9421,0.8495,7.3792,1.674,1.1154,0.751,3.6051,1.1577,0.3393,3.584,7.1653,4.7732,1.4566,1.9159,1.9398,5.3966,0.7399,4.9368,0.3511,0.5846,5.5674,2.776,1.0818,0.004,1.9905,2.8731,0.0078,0.4888,2.3703,9.0749,0.8545,0.117,3.8564,2.2403,4.8926,1.5938,4.4613,3.6711,0.0534,1.2443,4.0513,1.7092,0.3561,2.2756,0.0019,0.7874,2.7153,5.5257,5.2532,6.7076,1.7955,1.662,1.8887,2.5342,4.4354,1.4062,2.4076,0.1693,0.4308,0.3202,5.7329,2.8424,4.3245,4.5887,6.6148,4.7638,6.9066,3.3566,1.6346,1.8761,0.1481,11.1583,4.952,1.3529,5.1825,6.0142,1.8889,5.6986,1.8719,3.8767,0.0221,3.6255,1.4821,3.6063,3.289,5.6807,1.6243,7.9193,3.2456,0.275,0.9221,3.3052,3.8185,0.4773,3.1866,3.9217,2.5941,2.2129,0.8007,1.7389,0.2287,9.728,1.789,1.9624,1.5588,1.0893,0.1756,1.646,4.924,0.7016,8.3924,2.3857,2.6359,2.3892,1.0107,1.8842,0.1346,2.019,2.3314,0.6595,3.2414,3.2524,0.5139,4.1125,0.0065,1.8801,1.4025,3.0944,3.8839,2.2769,1.3054,1.3053,4.782,7.2094,1.8853,1.093,0.0867,6.5807,6.2142,0.0008,4.6171,1.7789,4.1367,6.4953,4.9873,2.2469,0.2778,1.3191,4.8325,1.4947,0.7304,2.6759,3.7948,1.7404,5.2455,2.2873,2.645,1.1172,5.1606,9.7579,7.5339,1.0327,1.3382,4.0242,5.662,5.4895,2.4766,3.8253,0.931,2.2384,1.9229,4.2999,0.7941,1.414,4.5949,0.0002,1.6606,1.7267,6.2766,5.4786,4.8257,3.7545,0.6788,0.3918,6.9829,1.3149,1.6865,0.9243,0.8708,0.2978,7.1803,0.4047,6.6542,15.5051,5.3965,1.2919,2.0409,1.3541,3.7651,1.3824,0.2439,3.5622,0.7825,0.2263,0.0052,2.378,4.4529,6.9789,3.1466,2.0593,1.009,0.8501,2.4059,5.8345,1.4327,1.4934,4.2752,2.0298,5.5522,6.088,4.5254,6.0515,3.8575,0.6811,1.7873,0.0013,1.5487,1.7955,1.2825,1.9603,2.3024,2.9052,2.8009,1.3507,0.8992,0.2906,3.4485,4.7333,1.8474,1.1906,3.6834,3.6641,2.1927,4.6477,1.8355,1.7517,0.0634,1.2811,3.3638,1.3886,2.0302,1.2354,0.928,0.0619,3.8267,4.2319,0.4841,0.8528,0.0061,4.5447,2.2966,3.8981,5.219,0.685,0.7932,6.5669,0.4094,4.2374,3.5033,0.957,0.8785,1.6703,2.8097,0.0687,7.4198,3.6126,2.4255,1.2175,1.0063,0.0848,1.0525,3.0237,1.7297,5.7296,1.4352,1.6545,2.4264,4.2284,5.2209,0.5486,3.3107,2.0754,2.0897,1.7042,2.4535,0.7305,2.0743,4.8719,0.7005,7.203,2.5141,0.283,4.3894,0.0302,3.1023,2.718,0.9895]}

The trial was in Frankfurt in the state of Hesse, where most of the festival was held. The court heard that the organisers had failed to take precautions to secure the crowd and keep people apart as a stampede occurred. The organisers admitted that they made mistakes and planned the festival again in subsequent years, but found no criminal liability.\nThe trial took place against seven organizers and four public officials. Among the organizers stands the former Love Parade organizer Olaf Lengerer. He denied any wrongdoing at the time of the festival and says that the organisers made mistakes that put people at risk.\nGerman authorities said that the organisers of the 2010 festival \u2013 the biggest event this year on the German and European calendar, with millions of people attending \u2013 should have made clear warnings about safety risks. The organizers of the festival have now admitted that a stampede developed due to \u201cpeople crowding against a wall or trying to move quickly\u201d. This caused a failure to separate the crowd, leading to the stampede, which resulted in the deaths of 21 participants and more than 650 injuries.\nThe event\u2019s organizers now say they will consider cancelling the 2010 festival if they receive the necessary approval for the re-evaluation. The organizers said they will now ask parliament after the event\u2019s organizers to provide assurances for safety measures to be improved before the next event.

Erdogan's daughter, Emre, as well as other family members, including a son-in-law, are the subjects of the investigation.\nThe Prosecutor's Office also said that it was investigating allegations that Turkish intelligence agency M\u0130T helped the government hide funds from Erdogan's family.\n\"This case will not end up in a trial, as it is not yet decided whether charges should be brought,\" M\u0130T spokesman \u015eafak Numan told CNN on Thursday.\nNuman also noted that Turkey had no extradition treaty with Belgium, and that a Belgian court might therefore not be able to hand down a verdict against Erdogan on what charges.\nOn Wednesday, Belgian television reported that M\u0130T had received at least a total of 14 million euros (14 million dollars) in the name of Turks living in Belgium within the last four years, which the intelligence organization then allegedly redirected to the family of President Erdogan.\nCNN reported that the investigation would not include allegations that the officials involved tried to influence Belgium's court in order to speed up the investigation.\nBut the prosecutor said he was not convinced that Belgium would allow an investigator from Turkey to enter the country.\nThe Prosecutor's Office said it had requested its Belgian counterparts to help with the case. But on Thursday, a Dutch court in the Netherlands denied an extradition request from Turkey for former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and one of his sons, saying Davutoglu had suffered an injury to the head and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nBoth Davutoglu and his son were charged with using false documents to obtain a bank account in the Netherlands in 2011.","token_len":393,"entropy":[10.3138,2.868,2.1579,1.7535,1.37,1.6957,1.6417,2.8032,0.6669,4.6629,4.3365,0.1427,8.2423,11.7805,6.4766,4.3088,0.0913,0.4893,6.4352,1.282,2.333,2.8261,2.4174,5.2343,3.7153,1.8136,5.7727,0.8337,1.3823,3.5791,0.0456,2.7425,8.7854,0.4487,4.0504,0.1282,0.1881,14.1603,5.4163,1.3556,1.7202,4.626,4.3993,0.1146,0.5379,5.5042,1.2648,4.6914,2.01,3.1842,1.1957,2.191,1.0121,0.5899,1.6085,0.5773,1.5874,0.6901,5.6483,1.1064,4.0407,0.9072,5.7329,1.8141,1.2273,6.5271,0.0775,0.0035,3.0029,1.6191,0.0247,0.9506,4.7831,2.6202,3.5484,1.946,0.0017,0.0009,0.0011,1.0001,2.5201,4.6093,3.4422,0.0275,0.9798,1.0674,0.3342,0.192,1.53,7.1403,0.7498,0.0549,3.4441,0.4371,1.856,2.8392,1.2006,1.141,1.6004,0.3938,3.6137,3.3985,5.0241,6.7558,1.5519,0.003,1.2425,7.9974,1.9001,4.1454,3.9959,2.7125,1.5383,7.494,0.3441,0.6745,0.8093,0.332,2.131,3.5593,2.5665,3.8092,2.1679,2.7255,3.9631,1.3596,2.2936,3.8565,1.92,2.7204,1.8817,1.0719,1.5645,4.2631,3.0648,1.2933,5.3069,2.7256,0.0607,0.8185,1.7354,4.5078,0.0558,0.0003,0.0024,1.117,5.6202,0.0174,4.744,2.6879,6.0025,3.7775,1.0497,3.7443,2.8521,0.5186,0.2247,0.2895,4.1231,0.0093,2.5035,4.3118,0.1089,3.7235,1.879,3.3551,3.1795,0.3269,0.1247,6.4854,1.1381,2.5634,0.996,3.6186,4.4788,1.251,5.8733,7.1276,1.8613,2.0223,0.4342,0.0071,5.2607,1.2401,1.6163,2.8718,2.1149,0.7996,3.8166,5.6543,3.2258,2.788,0.1852,4.393,1.3878,0.1452,3.3354,5.9697,1.224,0.1398,4.4126,0.0122,0.0005,0.0009,1.0751,4.0098,4.8099,0.0037,4.073,6.1211,0.0476,4.7348,1.0687,0.1808,2.7635,3.4932,1.1053,2.0594,0.1577,1.1284,3.6837,5.3468,0.0133,8.4717,1.9906,0.3595,1.2174,7.3451,0.8648,0.9173,3.0851,0.1604,1.4234,3.1051,2.9806,6.8655,6.1192,5.725,5.2244,6.7799,0.3354,1.4632,3.3441,1.5212,4.5084,1.7847,0.5837,0.287,4.2448,1.4346,0.3229,1.0398,5.0032,3.9857,2.7713,4.3174,3.4475,0.7211,1.2724,6.7514,3.5523,6.0626,0.0265,3.4304,5.1534,0.3912,4.3565,4.0627,2.3943,0.0146,7.83,0.3706,0.774,3.4412,0.4518,0.3411,4.0431,1.7577,2.6491,3.0116,2.6931,1.45,1.9981,3.6628,0.5192,3.6824,3.0696,3.8136,3.4666,7.182,2.8696,2.5831,0.3004,3.0054,0.9442,0.5618,1.4191,0.3101,2.4221,5.1841,0.0334,0.0279,1.1016,1.2624,1.6715,4.6399,6.2692,4.904,1.1148,0.6081,4.1131,2.6053,0.1947,1.5962,1.0976,4.9789,4.2429,0.3225,0.444,3.0449,3.5977,1.7905,3.7817,2.2386,1.2415,3.4534,3.4956,0.9259,0.0496,1.5582,1.9863,3.1621,5.8179,3.2802,0.0029,3.9135,0.0003,0.0026,1.0689,0.0001,2.4828,5.4658,0.8303,0.3983,1.6412,0.8675,5.4704,4.0824,0.0015,0.0004,1.1049,7.0295,3.227,1.957,3.3501,2.6503,0.2544,1.8701,1.6854,3.0948,0.1603,3.657,0.0508,0.0382,0.01,0.0725,0.2598,0.2213,6.1528,0.6223,0.0017,0.0006,0.1131,0.8513,1.1409,1.5331,3.8062,0.6233,5.6125,4.2053,1.5859,0.367,3.2701,3.007,7.2212,0.365,1.8204,2.1524,0.9373,3.5761,4.228,1.2575]}

While Trump has gone after his top opponents in the Senate \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Mitch McConnell Jr. of Tennessee \u2014 he has used a different approach in his repeated attacks and insults of senators in the past two weeks.\nTrump\u2019s tactics in several instances have included statements and photos suggesting that senators\u2019 wives or lovers were not loyal, untrustworthy or disloyal. These were then shared on social media with thousands of retweets or likes. The senators whose wives or lovers have been Trump\u2019s targets included Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Marco Rubio of Florida, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Amy McGrath of Texas, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Ted Cruz of Texas.\nThe photo below was leaked in the news that the Democratic governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has threatened to take legal action against Senator McConnell because he shared the photo with the statement that his wife and lover had fallen in love with Trump Jr., Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona also shared the photo. The following is what he wrote at the time of the photos:\nWith the above warning, Doug Ducey said that in the future there may be more attacks from the president that may cause him to take legal action.

{"prompt":"Students and faculty at Georgetown Law School gathered on Tuesday to protest that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was delivering an address about the right of free speech on college campuses to an invitation-only audience","text":"Students and faculty at Georgetown Law School gathered on Tuesday to protest that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was delivering an address about the right of free speech on college campuses to an invitation-only audience. One hundred plus student activists, including some with hats bearing the slogan \u201cFree Speech for ALL,\u201d joined the group in their protest against the administration\u2019s moves to suppress free speech on campuses.\nThe college students who joined the group represented a diversity of students at Georgetown Law including Black students, Muslim students, LGBT students, students with disabilities and even non-traditional students like those of Jewish descent, or those who belong to a non-religious community. One student stated that being in a non-religious community didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t think it was important to speak-out in favor of the right to free speech.\nThe protestors said they wanted to be there to voice their support for free speech on campuses, and they spoke about the harm being inflicted on students across the country by those who use the First Amendment only to censor and silence those who disagree. The protesters cited recent experiences at their own college in which students have been sent away from the school. A student shared a personal story of being sent to campus counseling for stating facts about one of the university\u2019s leaders.\nThe Georgetown Law School\u2019s students didn\u2019t have a place of their own to stand and protest free-speech advocates, so they decided their protest would occur on the grounds of the American University School of Law just across the street from the law school. As they were marching across the street they were stopped by the law school police. One of the students was arrested although police said they didn\u2019t understand why they were arresting anyone. During the arrest, two other protesters were arrested for harassing the student and refusing to go. One was an academic assistant and the other\u2019s name has not been released to the public.","token_len":395,"entropy":[3.4373,4.7265,2.5163,6.0132,4.0765,1.0155,7.649,2.7272,2.9107,1.0671,3.1428,5.9693,4.9495,0.3334,0.0081,0.0022,3.7749,0.9351,0.9561,0.0016,2.8314,8.9407,2.7876,4.2481,3.7271,1.891,6.4681,1.7142,4.3724,0.0216,2.52,2.3535,0.0085,3.0191,3.4356,8.0582,1.7119,0.0007,0.8554,0.9035,6.4221,5.3524,8.3004,4.5845,1.8057,2.4454,1.6646,3.1731,3.4427,8.1693,2.6038,0.4698,2.6129,11.0424,8.653,2.1032,0.067,1.6008,4.4865,2.9632,10.8276,7.2807,3.1176,1.0223,3.766,2.3947,3.7805,1.5714,3.2712,1.5657,3.2437,9.9202,6.2269,6.4663,7.5164,0.4776,5.1989,0.8275,0.0499,1.5577,2.002,0.7289,0.5255,12.4275,6.0915,2.942,3.2677,2.7045,0.4745,2.1192,6.6598,1.715,5.2141,0.1757,3.2589,3.9195,0.9989,0.7739,7.5074,5.2813,1.1793,0.3794,4.7974,0.2345,0.1897,4.0086,0.4567,0.2304,3.8292,2.5758,0.2272,1.5953,5.1394,3.8751,0.1149,4.0879,2.2696,5.0857,4.0554,3.6294,6.5635,7.084,2.611,5.6817,1.6712,1.1397,5.3955,0.0269,1.8961,3.0433,0.0397,2.6592,2.3292,0.4098,4.7099,2.0622,5.268,0.714,6.3154,3.4123,1.1887,1.7015,0.0063,0.2516,0.3151,6.5767,8.1996,3.7426,0.088,1.2997,2.6642,2.3926,0.1664,0.0586,0.0195,3.7787,2.3285,0.4776,3.7419,0.623,1.8358,9.2558,0.6279,3.9826,2.5954,0.0019,2.5373,2.1229,0.9951,0.7747,0.0599,0.814,0.7223,1.837,4.4825,3.0125,1.7376,1.9808,0.5153,3.7047,5.1156,0.7379,3.2442,0.2156,3.3764,0.3041,1.1187,0.0572,1.0126,1.7869,1.8469,1.5794,1.8837,4.6042,2.9665,1.1691,5.7899,4.2417,2.9805,0.5919,2.2883,6.1051,0.2245,0.3006,0.6941,4.6572,0.3676,4.4761,1.5792,3.6545,0.0021,5.73,0.2708,4.8891,2.8065,1.1489,3.4454,0.6085,0.8,1.9026,2.7283,2.3091,5.6865,3.4296,6.5991,2.1664,6.0886,2.9073,2.9891,3.0059,1.6126,1.6892,1.8039,0.3299,5.7286,5.2536,1.5384,2.5458,2.1038,5.5524,4.33,2.1321,7.3193,1.5969,4.8403,0.6954,0.7559,1.1318,1.3028,1.8019,4.6375,6.8452,2.3243,7.6726,10.5078,1.7679,5.3072,0.4435,1.2523,3.939,6.8725,0.3655,0.0078,6.2721,1.7058,0.8837,1.66,3.2099,1.1916,2.8868,12.2871,0.1234,0.0202,3.8083,6.4968,0.0672,0.1281,0.001,2.5214,1.8768,3.8415,5.0811,0.2869,0.0099,2.0844,3.9829,2.4703,2.312,5.5332,5.5625,0.004,4.7748,2.221,3.0881,0.457,2.7794,7.0953,2.857,1.4921,6.169,1.8388,1.7236,3.7929,0.6934,1.2216,4.8249,1.135,4.8443,0.0468,0.0444,7.8777,3.6282,0.2716,0.1541,0.1196,0.4976,3.1142,0.1246,0.5831,4.2689,2.4257,2.3963,3.6645,4.2738,0.6223,0.3295,3.1979,1.5591,2.8914,0.2268,2.5879,2.7719,0.566,3.4446,1.4538,3.3892,0.9806,0.1492,1.2112,2.8196,2.3356,10.2227,4.3169,1.7386,1.411,2.3778,0.0737,0.062,0.0035,6.1003,0.5957,1.9039,0.3695,4.3043,5.2826,0.6399,5.8538,0.4679,3.2467,0.9543,4.4872,2.81,2.6885,1.1178,1.4919,1.8112,6.2314,1.81,3.3248,2.4196,5.8085,0.0334,5.3276,5.6589,2.3975,2.9997,5.6943,5.1206,3.5725,2.5396,1.1218,0.0788,11.9775,0.0434,0.2971,6.3289,5.0075,0.4381,0.114,0.0937,3.8373,0.7541,1.8878,0.2114]}

In many instances, the victims are Muslim Rohingya and other Buddhist victims are the main perpetrators,\" Power said in a statement.\nBuddhist and Muslim minority groups of ethnic groups have been embroiled in a long history of conflict in Myanmar, beginning with the brutal suppression of the 1962 uprising by troops from what was Burma's minority Muslim and Buddhist states in the wake of the 1962 military coup.\nAs the U.N. report acknowledged, the Myanmar army has launched a crackdown on Muslims with a brutal campaign of attacks, killings and forced displacement. It has fired live rounds at crowds of civilians in retaliation for attacks by Muslim insurgents, the report found. Many civilians have been murdered or driven into refugee camps.\nOn Tuesday, Power also condemned the brutal actions of vigilante groups in the attacks, in which hundreds of Muslims have been killed.\nPower said the violence in Rakhine has left thousands dead, with nearly 800,000 displaced and \"it will not end today.\"","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.8217,3.8045,9.2471,3.1262,2.6981,2.2878,2.369,2.74,4.4309,0.0846,1.8899,2.4504,0.0098,0.0004,1.4914,8.2231,1.126,6.2127,2.1538,0.7567,3.9863,1.7861,4.3151,6.5037,0.0134,8.7785,6.4509,6.2045,5.5294,4.5545,0.0589,0.5751,0.0143,0.3874,6.4106,1.2177,0.1243,1.3672,7.6201,0.4845,0.0269,3.516,0.0487,3.4037,2.6612,5.8518,3.7683,1.929,5.7365,2.2855,0.6235,0.322,10.9333,1.709,5.5901,1.691,5.6393,0.003,0.0159,1.2349,2.1418,0.9096,3.9647,2.5672,2.4538,1.5242,4.5076,6.8928,5.7228,1.8626,2.2183,0.5407,2.2434,0.8668,0.0251,3.2765,0.9279,0.9172,6.3486,0.0698,0.0708,3.2813,0.0005,0.0839,0.0512,4.9176,0.9415,4.5507,1.0862,6.3751,0.0031,0.2823,3.5761,1.0798,3.8307,0.0032,3.3644,1.8075,4.7016,1.8597,3.7386,0.4242,2.7043,0.1469,0.9737,3.5644,1.0064,0.5795,4.8448,5.8731,0.6658,6.0449,0.3761,5.1441,5.016,0.0795,0.1872,3.2721,2.1948,3.4438,0.1129,0.0091,1.2375,6.4892,0.7329,3.0012,0.3532,4.7849,1.0205,0.8719,4.7453,3.7257,0.0345,7.6283,0.8532,0.0659,1.4846,2.5503,1.7706,7.8742,0.1615,0.803,2.4283,0.6927,0.3965,3.7373,1.5927,2.5349,1.6092,0.4413,4.1256,3.5986,2.7671,0.45,7.3184,3.1004,3.1778,5.6,0.0018,3.3015,1.0967,0.904,3.0871,4.3993,0.0013,0.0011,0.6016,1.0727,3.2417,1.9429,0.9152,5.2707,6.8145,5.7076,0.3986,0.9977,2.9067,0.166,4.5806,2.6084,1.3261,0.218,0.8435,1.6604,4.8669,5.6701,0.1592,0.7616,2.6138,2.2017,6.2362,4.5871,4.9946,1.0317,1.4374,1.7164,0.0017,4.9865,1.4763,3.015,3.42,3.9959,3.2572,0.387,1.6681,4.3062,2.0953,2.4899,3.8147,2.7681,4.0755,6.1278,4.5474,2.9011,3.8454,6.0844,2.8942,1.0973,1.9416,0.0885,2.2129,0.8742,0.259,0.3147,0.3336,5.6184,0.5147,0.4692,3.8074,1.2224,5.1976,0.7466,5.8534,4.8132,3.971,1.8575,1.2683,6.9309,0.0126,1.3619,2.1461,3.8879,0.016,3.3913,1.3342,0.7971,0.8642,4.4949,0.7293,0.4615,5.2855,3.3004,0.0782,1.022,7.1065,2.7472,1.9384,6.1591,2.2237,8.011,1.4152,7.5627,0.878,5.1633,1.7483,5.2307,1.1286,4.0392,3.056,0.5959,3.7662,0.0012,0.6731,3.83,4.0693,0.4194,0.5792,0.5064,4.8706,1.5669,3.3629,0.0005,0.2337,0.0975,5.3156,5.0542,0.3372,1.3976,3.5191,2.8994,1.7087,5.4795,2.0186,4.1705,0.4242,2.5686,5.3209,2.5468,3.5231,1.7054,1.1625,3.8208,2.4057,4.2649,0.4034,2.8827,1.1404,1.3453,3.5776,0.4519,6.306,6.6129,1.2874,1.1976,6.4749,0.5345,3.0152,2.1839,6.3507,0.989,3.2653,1.0141,2.0774,0.8844,1.6015,4.3601,0.8765,3.7393,0.2261,5.6529,3.6496,0.7431,0.5036,4.8613,1.3531,3.5111,2.7483,5.2885,0.0126,1.2456,0.3811,4.0927,2.2194,0.1081,7.8333,4.0107,2.5288,0.5894,4.3837,4.2092,0.2151,7.3532,0.6233,1.8496,1.8917,7.9086,1.4205,4.6735,0.9279,3.1564,0.2892,2.6569,2.9179,0.097,0.2511,1.7132,0.4539,4.0643,0.8961,1.2868,2.6245,1.3568,0.4477,0.0027,0.0006,3.1868,3.2515,3.441,3.6887,1.1262,3.4178,3.998,4.5421,2.2219,0.004,1.8899,1.8368,5.3529,7.1104,3.1647,2.1109,2.1455,6.0286,0.6543]}

Bob Menendez of New Jersey told the Associated Press in an interview that the bill, called DREAM Act (Dream Act, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), was making progress as a result of a proposal advanced by Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.\n\"There are several elements that are moving in the right direction,\" Menendez said. \"What I hope will happen is that that effort -- and I mean not only our effort -- but the effort in both Congress and the White House is that by the time we get into the election, we should be able to reach something like bipartisan consensus on a permanent bill.\"\nMenendez and other top Democrats said they are keeping up their pressure on President Bush to sign the bill and said it would be a mistake to pass a temporary measure and then allow the president to veto it as he often did during the last year.\n\"I think it's going to be a mistake... to pass a temporary measure and have the President go around and veto it, just because it may not be able to hold up in the court system,\" Menendez said. \"If we really put our full and undivided focus on an effort of the type that has been moving, that could hold up and have bipartisan support.\"\nThe DREAM Act, which President Bush has said he's committed to signing, would grant undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children the same basic protections as those lawful permanent residents who have been here for five years or longer.\nThe measure was introduced last month by two lawmakers, Sen. Santorum and Rep. Ruben Gallego of California. Neither is seeking re-election. Santorum also is the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.","token_len":395,"entropy":[6.6897,6.4878,2.4554,0.3614,3.0594,0.0008,0.0042,0.0206,0.9562,3.2036,9.8144,3.8229,3.4954,5.2777,5.0221,5.1978,4.2165,6.7395,0.6198,0.3484,0.0416,1.4487,0.001,1.8241,0.1089,1.869,5.7948,6.8583,2.863,0.102,1.7183,1.6878,1.4385,2.6148,2.4128,3.6427,3.1243,2.6866,0.4357,4.0967,6.7926,3.3567,0.6692,0.185,0.2722,22.9176,0.061,4.2158,1.6846,0.0,2.7584,0.036,0.0023,4.0118,2.807,1.6325,0.0004,2.9252,0.9592,0.063,0.7513,1.7185,2.655,2.3562,3.4066,6.0337,0.1434,0.0119,4.3817,5.1105,0.2042,4.1831,6.2397,0.0054,2.8243,0.0003,0.0012,0.0037,0.0395,0.0,0.0009,0.5412,1.5723,5.728,0.6125,4.8067,2.6433,0.7773,0.0801,2.4324,6.2453,6.9166,0.5038,1.5155,0.0014,7.7199,0.3361,0.6268,0.038,1.028,0.3485,1.2636,3.1566,1.4455,4.7137,5.0179,1.2766,1.3814,3.157,1.7281,0.3485,0.1036,0.0057,0.7386,0.6914,0.0,0.1697,0.4002,0.2461,5.2511,1.6322,3.2298,3.825,1.8316,0.4491,0.8025,5.2333,4.6811,7.3619,1.9252,1.8219,4.7563,7.2729,2.3345,4.9249,2.686,2.0975,5.1617,1.4909,2.3868,3.2941,4.3478,3.7531,0.1041,0.6083,1.1082,0.0003,1.8904,4.3122,6.6098,1.8251,1.4734,0.9655,0.9534,3.0403,0.8179,7.0097,1.0782,0.9447,3.5686,1.046,0.8246,0.0159,5.5619,4.8942,3.0363,7.1737,2.8952,1.5174,2.3078,4.9138,3.4089,1.4577,0.0738,2.5835,0.0001,3.4061,2.7491,4.2643,0.4923,2.6187,1.1517,2.9003,5.9568,3.7608,1.8902,4.7169,0.8522,2.4093,6.2591,1.1201,2.2295,0.6345,0.5163,3.2506,3.8739,2.6476,1.6781,1.5996,1.3355,4.2233,0.9735,3.3684,1.7627,3.9837,0.8771,4.8861,2.0758,4.5325,1.9195,1.7627,0.1631,2.0629,0.5171,4.5206,1.7947,6.7901,2.1703,2.7042,0.7058,2.8977,3.8034,1.4116,0.2474,1.3008,1.7609,1.2189,1.8605,0.4678,3.3104,0.0151,0.5539,0.9174,1.5176,7.9134,1.8861,1.9344,0.6411,1.262,0.7612,1.0638,6.0993,1.6483,2.9156,5.6044,3.6382,0.9981,1.0425,0.3242,2.5371,4.0616,1.2886,1.6553,5.4602,1.8974,0.5951,4.4221,0.0035,5.5445,1.5379,1.8582,0.6411,4.3679,3.5364,0.8101,0.5194,0.0,0.1043,0.2107,0.968,2.9319,2.0738,4.6176,6.1002,2.1892,5.133,4.288,6.5317,0.0855,0.0004,2.6947,0.1258,5.9637,1.9303,4.7254,2.9089,7.458,0.7209,2.8064,0.5311,5.3301,4.3949,2.5801,3.9234,6.5926,0.4228,3.3451,4.1209,4.9445,0.9499,1.3827,0.1194,1.9336,4.7501,0.0005,0.0463,1.6012,0.7446,5.0264,1.5283,3.5178,1.7851,1.5375,5.1522,2.2433,0.0179,3.0683,0.7227,1.0187,4.112,3.1845,0.4588,1.2741,2.421,0.1177,0.0315,0.5283,0.0006,0.3904,0.1063,1.3995,3.2505,5.7122,1.4759,0.5154,1.928,7.6845,0.3219,0.0461,2.1409,2.0188,1.2081,2.9263,0.9278,3.0331,0.0623,1.2591,1.6828,0.6596,0.9468,1.6547,2.9386,2.9641,1.6664,3.0603,1.73,0.7144,5.9959,5.0425,1.3628,1.6876,0.0006,11.7352,0.9384,1.4365,0.0005,5.5775,0.0085,0.5247,0.0018,0.0706,0.2755,2.0214,0.6777,5.8841,3.3744,3.4032,1.1331,0.0389,0.0035,1.085,4.5896,4.462,2.7289,3.3375,3.5866,3.1082,0.0103,0.0697,0.5882,1.6301,0.0028,0.0458,0.5689]}

Now is the time to stick to our guns and get tough with Russia in every way possible.\"\nSpeaking to Politico at the National Gallery in Washington, the White House told foreign policy reporters \"the government remains the same. We're going to enforce sanctions,\" the spokesman said according to the AP.\nThe Senate passed a bill on Monday outlawing Russian interference in US elections and including additional sanctions targeting the country's largest firms, a move Trump has promised to sign into law. The legislation would extend an existing law that barred American support to foreign governments that seek influence over elections in other countries.\nAsked about the new bill, Trump at Tuesday's event said he hopes it will be signed by the president after it has passed the U.S. House of Representatives that voted it down last week.\n\"If they're going to give it my blessing -- and they should -- that will allow me, if you don't say anything to the press or the reporters, to sign off on it and send it to the White House,\" Trump said.

One of our soldiers wrote a poem there when he was 18,\" Erkan said, referring to soldiers who died there in 1918 during the Ottoman campaign to liberate the city from the British and French occupiers.\nThe Ottoman campaign was meant to free it from their foreign occupiers, but many soldiers also became prisoners and were detained there.\n\"I remember how they tore down the wall of the mosque with swords and axes. In a war we were fighting to get rid of some oppression,\" he continues.\nHis father, for his part, died in prison during the Ottoman campaign, and later the family suffered political persecutions.\n\"That was a period when it was hard for us to talk about history due to that regime's suppression,\" he continued.\nHe and his family lived abroad for much of that time as it was not easy to speak about the past. \"I feel that we must keep our history alive. It is important to talk about it.\"","token_len":396,"entropy":[7.8318,3.977,0.1934,13.2553,0.9993,2.1448,0.8399,0.0238,5.5708,6.1832,4.1913,2.3511,3.5621,2.2582,2.0891,2.0257,5.0181,4.5848,0.0029,7.1095,0.7716,8.698,0.0016,6.9245,0.7933,7.2857,1.9661,7.172,1.5349,6.9967,0.5948,0.6658,3.1985,3.2014,2.8283,0.0081,0.8821,0.185,0.1195,11.2681,2.4476,3.5549,3.5684,1.4629,5.5878,4.4298,1.1092,0.2894,5.6353,1.2916,2.4121,1.1239,3.314,0.1871,2.1145,2.5806,1.3987,6.0684,0.0227,0.6409,0.5085,0.7052,0.8496,0.3236,3.2257,1.741,3.0834,3.0544,9.8965,7.8043,7.3709,0.3181,0.3129,5.2828,8.501,1.9464,9.2129,0.3604,3.2029,3.3088,1.1664,0.5505,2.1674,5.4004,1.2496,0.3836,4.3189,5.7043,0.5391,0.9932,5.1604,1.7885,4.1001,5.1887,1.833,6.0863,5.6375,5.69,0.6197,6.4068,0.4895,1.2171,3.0107,0.0004,0.0,3.2932,1.049,6.0423,0.6852,1.1231,3.7942,0.597,1.4876,0.1578,2.0125,2.8195,1.5786,3.9262,7.4027,0.0331,5.471,2.5951,0.9888,4.0738,1.6674,0.0966,6.3874,3.7048,3.2486,2.6131,2.4067,3.254,0.7379,0.1371,5.7088,1.7049,4.9854,1.9211,6.3025,0.4276,1.435,5.5652,1.3879,5.9536,0.4537,3.8836,1.5004,2.9526,2.0484,2.3869,1.6074,6.1333,1.3961,0.0358,0.1117,2.0203,4.5203,4.5959,1.1565,0.2034,8.3178,4.1183,4.2789,1.8943,5.9033,0.0595,2.6137,5.0477,1.1024,3.4995,4.9811,1.3499,6.9721,6.2908,6.2069,6.6151,0.5732,3.0561,1.8762,4.5579,0.8225,1.0099,2.6211,7.1253,2.8427,3.3456,0.076,3.1912,0.6594,0.3027,1.7398,8.7037,0.1177,4.8337,2.0849,1.6612,1.224,1.2795,6.5918,2.53,4.22,0.5636,1.1543,1.0231,6.0894,1.9071,2.6054,6.2889,6.6524,0.6971,0.6198,4.7905,2.4945,1.4332,0.004,0.6704,2.1374,1.7867,0.0054,6.9783,0.941,2.1678,4.1254,1.0329,3.2181,3.4052,0.7915,1.3604,4.6581,1.9169,2.4707,1.1018,0.6551,1.7146,1.5969,2.7891,2.8475,0.6222,2.5946,0.0073,0.2177,0.1872,1.9505,4.2481,6.4827,2.2348,5.4713,0.1077,4.899,5.4472,0.2928,6.0564,6.2017,2.1422,0.0746,1.2267,1.625,3.6987,4.5794,5.2175,4.8865,3.8647,3.3782,2.3727,5.705,2.7536,1.2497,0.5334,2.4342,3.4619,4.2389,3.6625,2.6698,5.3681,1.0442,0.6342,2.1777,1.1157,0.7572,2.957,3.8357,4.1858,0.8709,2.126,1.6816,4.1293,3.337,5.3133,4.2712,3.2457,2.3155,3.2752,5.1711,1.6427,0.0156,5.7219,6.7138,1.5153,1.6157,10.8347,0.1229,0.4254,4.8582,2.2623,1.2888,6.78,0.3999,0.0005,0.0081,6.5794,0.7565,4.2612,3.2564,0.3158,2.8228,1.3552,1.6108,1.3979,4.9455,4.0179,5.254,6.6918,5.4043,8.9916,0.4573,0.0002,1.1707,0.5049,2.1186,5.6779,1.8252,1.862,4.6043,1.7673,3.8328,0.4416,3.7191,0.7745,1.1152,0.3594,5.0243,0.3319,5.5365,7.3547,0.007,4.6152,8.4525,2.0843,5.2328,1.9061,0.846,3.7963,0.0919,0.6027,2.7497,5.7246,0.3533,1.7097,4.3037,7.2044,1.095,3.6249,0.0086,3.0423,0.3134,3.9499,5.0239,0.3602,2.7497,3.8478,0.5417,5.0335,1.8263,1.061,3.3714,0.7836,2.1584,2.0703,5.1788,1.6047,2.0674,3.4456,4.2881,1.7285,3.3892,1.4292,2.2477,2.6191,0.8299,2.5495,1.0406,4.5605,0.1128,1.892,3.6789]}

I think we all","text":"British interior minister Amber Rudd said on Thursday she hoped Britain s condemnation of U.S. President Donald Trump for retweeting material from a British far-right group would have an impact. I think we all expect our British counterparts to have their say and they are not shy to tell the American people, she said in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland. Ms Rudd said it was a matter of time before the United States government took notice. The tweet by Mr Trump on January 18, a reference to a book published last year by right-wing provocateurs Steve Bannon and Jason Chaffetz and a far right British website, had its author, a convicted extremist, posted a message on Twitter calling on the American president to be prosecuted for inciting his supporters to violent insurrection. The British Home Affairs Secretary, Stewart Donaldson, condemned the tweet on Tuesday, but she said Mr Trump would not have been able to travel to the UK as a free passenger without one. Ms Rudd said that her visit to Britain on November 20 would be a \u201cgood opportunity to see the home secretary\u201d. The UK does not have a extradition treaty with the United States. Ms Rudd said that at the time of the tweet she could not tell whether Mr Trump intended to visit the UK. As a prime minister, she could only ask British security firms to help identify him, she said. What I can tell is that people across the Atlantic who see material like that, do have a very strong sense of what that material means, Ms Rudd said. They also know that if a British person were to do something like that, they would be held accountable under British law. She also said she hoped it showed the US that it \u201cwill not tolerate violent incitement of violence\u201d.\nIn the new film about the late U.S. President\u2019s last days in the White House, actor Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role of Robert Trump, Mr. Trump\u2019s brother.","token_len":398,"entropy":[10.1419,1.0524,7.7656,0.0002,1.8431,2.9868,1.9568,2.6768,3.9392,4.3354,11.0943,15.3052,0.3515,7.6252,0.0151,0.1451,0.0813,1.6799,0.0873,0.0035,5.031,6.3494,0.0049,6.1858,1.6593,1.5815,3.0453,6.1328,0.0399,0.0162,1.2648,2.7278,3.921,2.6102,0.7426,1.6173,10.14,3.4992,2.358,3.7339,6.1925,3.5642,4.3594,1.7503,0.1854,3.5797,2.7577,0.8889,2.4784,3.1525,3.1589,3.1552,6.1178,1.8959,4.9017,3.2266,3.5374,0.5623,3.5326,8.7962,0.274,1.8561,0.7833,0.0763,0.6669,2.5445,0.5173,5.7112,0.3293,4.6321,0.2331,1.0605,3.2231,0.4125,2.5182,2.852,0.566,2.2994,0.1412,1.4703,2.1574,0.3998,4.8947,3.1344,5.7621,1.5487,3.3371,5.8813,3.8909,3.7414,0.186,3.499,5.0843,3.521,1.9111,4.2497,3.0598,0.0016,1.4748,4.0967,3.0027,3.3329,0.3989,0.3254,4.5452,0.1884,0.0243,5.7918,0.0003,7.2168,6.0282,0.0776,0.0975,3.6695,4.7426,0.0003,5.1745,2.5848,6.0322,3.9018,5.4629,4.0868,1.3797,4.0451,6.9654,4.6746,1.9499,2.9245,6.2447,4.2054,1.2783,7.0487,3.2465,3.7883,1.1354,1.9206,3.6634,2.1051,1.7299,4.5679,1.3931,0.1266,3.3581,4.6475,0.9952,1.7105,5.7632,1.6789,0.2135,5.6046,5.3924,0.5634,1.6751,3.7411,4.339,3.8951,1.2677,1.1374,11.1283,11.0723,0.8104,0.0715,4.4667,0.4074,1.3131,2.8433,3.2734,1.6891,2.9566,3.1515,0.9078,4.1325,0.0224,3.0456,1.3782,2.21,1.7263,1.5484,0.0056,8.3259,0.3769,0.7274,2.5426,3.8285,1.9489,5.4868,8.8591,2.8879,6.9651,0.8255,2.6704,0.1395,0.4113,2.8825,4.4186,6.5718,0.5573,1.7024,3.8019,6.5748,3.0398,1.5082,1.481,1.5511,17.1364,7.0838,8.3762,2.5323,1.3009,3.8493,1.427,7.5164,0.7566,8.137,7.5232,2.1696,2.6443,3.5716,5.4795,0.2507,0.9452,0.88,5.313,0.0582,0.0788,0.3203,0.5424,0.0223,1.61,2.5556,0.1216,0.4166,1.837,5.6073,0.8884,1.1821,0.8937,0.8833,0.9351,2.025,3.3147,0.2258,4.0653,1.5208,1.7874,0.0226,3.8685,0.1306,3.4999,0.7092,0.84,1.5571,5.4099,1.7404,6.2314,0.0142,0.4902,0.551,2.657,2.957,4.148,4.5762,5.3385,7.8129,0.4516,2.7142,4.5554,5.2494,1.7826,0.7,0.2619,0.176,6.5891,5.0802,2.1712,0.7818,5.5638,0.2498,4.7496,3.1527,0.3625,3.9644,3.7006,4.6255,8.4469,4.0237,2.1719,2.0098,5.0851,4.9748,1.4277,3.1238,1.5492,1.6424,0.3795,1.4076,3.3629,4.6289,2.7143,1.7913,4.379,0.0413,0.2186,0.1163,4.8985,3.4404,1.7514,0.927,3.6931,3.2867,2.0822,2.7039,3.0677,0.2318,3.3038,1.4691,1.0192,0.3684,0.6147,1.4558,0.5463,1.0769,3.9745,0.8069,4.668,2.2107,0.063,0.5905,2.1638,3.2274,0.5111,1.9416,1.6758,3.9477,7.3666,1.7851,4.2804,1.7269,0.9463,11.2761,0.5463,4.9537,0.8033,1.4566,3.9751,4.8819,0.0103,2.479,1.4361,2.8438,2.0004,0.4712,2.8114,8.4875,2.0035,5.9555,6.1452,4.7901,1.2755,7.3124,3.6052,0.0018,0.0499,0.0183,1.2261,13.8861,6.4276,3.1752,6.6568,2.0806,1.7849,2.8657,1.7797,0.0013,0.2704,6.9056,6.0753,0.148,0.0004,0.0017,0.0,0.0,2.3451,1.8536,2.6624,0.0134,5.8902,5.2663,0.6299,6.2241,2.7071,0.0972,4.6335,1.0033,0.119,4.9695,1.6188]}

One of the witnesses is James Braid, the executive director of the National Food and Conservation Movement.

The Consumer Watchdog group has been investigating food safety violations and food security issues for over 20 years and plans to talk about the effects of genetically modified food on consumers and the environment.\nPublished: (July 15, 2016 - 12:00 am) The News Service of North America, Inc. reported that, to be honest, it did not always know who to trust.

As a result, cities and counties that rely on grants from the federal government are now faced with massive challenges as they seek to balance their budget and deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCaviar, the prized roe of the oysters, is as rare and precious as it is expensive. So it is no surprise that most are sold to people who do not know their origin or even know what type of oysters generate them. And that is exactly what happened in a store in Russia where six different types of caviar were sold and one of them was actually dead, dead fish meat, according to reports of Russian news portal RT.\nThe store owner made a mistake when he sold a customer six different types of caviar, when they were originally meant for one. As a result, the customer ended up with a dead fish, and it had to be thrown away.\nAt least two were killed when they were sold to their owners, and the rest died of old age, and they were just replaced with a different kind. The owner of the caviar shop was ordered to sell caviar for free.\nThe caviar was supposed to be for the Russian President, when he was travelling to China for a highlevel meeting. The story broke a few days ago, and the seller has been ordered to refund the customer, while he is still being investigated by the police at this point.","token_len":398,"entropy":[9.3021,0.0846,1.3216,2.0939,1.9858,4.9131,4.1227,2.8718,1.8491,1.6596,0.0007,0.4587,0.147,0.0003,0.6398,2.5981,3.1358,2.8535,1.5346,0.0844,1.3841,0.0026,4.5648,1.6184,0.4375,4.1704,5.0664,1.9139,4.1922,0.2382,0.9015,8.4997,0.0003,0.0014,0.0415,6.7699,0.2022,0.0034,0.0117,2.3048,0.0175,3.8849,0.61,1.0533,1.9431,3.9424,3.2605,0.9905,3.5873,4.3277,3.1672,2.449,4.512,2.6248,0.2431,3.0695,2.6151,3.5951,1.6014,6.9752,3.2196,2.5494,1.6628,2.2204,3.2588,1.7794,2.7523,6.0253,1.425,4.8002,1.8407,0.6765,1.0292,0.2662,0.1324,19.4848,3.1803,5.418,3.3564,2.687,4.2832,0.0466,0.9882,4.588,0.2656,0.3563,4.8667,4.8717,3.0548,1.6299,0.0179,3.3831,2.1404,8.8906,4.8628,0.9553,0.94,5.2365,0.3315,0.0055,1.0731,0.5829,3.8774,5.9716,1.6731,2.6234,0.966,2.0036,1.0651,4.1746,1.4205,0.0792,0.0554,6.0294,1.5921,1.5801,4.2307,2.2808,0.1776,6.5083,2.1585,0.717,0.2288,0.0252,0.9384,4.6023,6.2258,0.0089,5.0286,4.0044,4.0417,1.1499,2.7552,0.3023,3.9698,0.9821,2.1687,1.6589,5.3022,0.005,1.3884,4.5198,0.1744,2.1171,13.8084,16.1462,5.0071,8.1317,7.0311,0.0091,0.8001,0.2226,9.8371,11.1716,3.6219,3.2802,1.7214,10.899,9.4621,6.3348,2.0764,1.2177,11.0998,1.5513,1.3907,1.1921,6.507,4.807,2.6382,4.3991,0.2637,2.6018,0.0767,3.0279,0.4903,4.4359,2.8532,1.4934,3.4615,0.1742,0.2384,5.7209,5.4956,6.8282,2.4857,5.399,0.897,4.404,0.0493,1.8683,2.467,9.4095,2.7696,3.4118,2.2556,1.9014,6.0947,0.2293,0.2828,1.4642,11.7018,3.8381,0.2802,3.9106,3.082,1.3702,2.3607,0.3579,1.0747,2.1553,3.6982,7.378,1.0401,9.5327,2.5497,5.9075,4.4048,1.8777,0.14,6.3879,0.0,0.688,0.5781,4.0296,3.4277,1.1721,0.4188,0.9934,5.2137,8.1008,2.4184,6.8762,4.3983,8.4206,2.1594,1.3989,0.0009,3.9917,4.5611,4.1451,1.8743,6.3466,2.2991,0.1626,0.2834,2.0633,3.99,1.9148,6.4242,1.8161,3.262,2.0667,0.5719,1.9835,2.897,7.4084,6.9543,1.6074,0.4495,0.0506,0.1743,0.0004,1.2986,6.7614,3.3852,0.7431,7.1286,4.1453,1.793,4.5306,6.3828,4.8488,1.8758,0.2289,0.2902,1.3717,3.6958,4.4524,0.0018,1.3798,1.5722,2.7361,0.4884,2.0964,2.1278,3.0619,4.7516,0.9028,0.1436,5.6326,0.9749,0.6574,1.1851,5.0672,1.6203,2.388,7.1486,4.3499,2.8753,1.9473,0.4974,2.3863,1.7386,6.2984,1.7481,1.4156,1.9112,1.8317,2.6942,3.4532,2.346,4.7451,0.154,1.9638,4.4212,3.2691,1.131,5.7236,6.5697,1.1818,3.0287,3.1772,1.907,2.1376,2.4278,2.9832,1.5294,0.5255,3.5639,0.0012,1.4137,2.6796,5.0752,0.2055,3.4747,9.5061,0.0016,2.3701,4.1886,2.7297,1.1936,2.1081,3.8659,0.003,2.6731,4.4843,0.0012,0.3985,4.6186,2.2258,4.5704,5.2357,1.0973,6.0662,1.4131,1.4995,6.8513,1.3887,3.5705,2.119,0.9247,6.0617,9.8328,0.7241,1.6496,2.2738,5.542,5.4855,4.2076,0.7881,0.6449,1.3936,1.211,1.8417,1.8989,7.877,4.3099,1.9254,3.7128,0.1069,4.2477,0.5948,3.5384,2.499,5.3386,2.6601,1.3385,1.046,3.8891,2.5595,1.4652,0.8176,4.2418,6.4837,4.5192,0.9994,0.2517]}

He should not have any vote in our government, \u201c he said.\nAt the same time, some political observers have said that it is not possible to determine whether the president \u2019 s comments amount to a direct endorsement of Moore.\n\u201d My impression from those who know them is that they would be very supportive of him if he stands up for conservative values. So that doesn \u2019 t sound like a vote against the President, \u201d said political scientist Paul Cunningham, a staff member at the Center for Independent Studies.\nTrump took to the podium on a day when activists protesting against his administration took to the streets for a fifth day in a row across the United States. In Seattle, activists called for legal action against the White House for refusing to act aggressively against the election fraud Trump has accused his political rival, Democratic President Joe Biden of committing.\nMoore has faced numerous domestic and even international sexual assault allegations. In one of these, he says he was forced to have sex with an undercover FBI agent.\nHe is considered to be the frontrunner among conservatives among Republican Senate candidates in key election states, such as North Carolina and Florida, but he has not accepted a direct invitation to campaign among Trump supporters.\n\u201d It is always great to see the president here supporting us \u201d said Robert Canning, an Alabama Republican activist.\n\u201d We are committed to winning the Republican nomination and I think that Donald Trump is going to play a very big role for that, \u201c he said.","token_len":399,"entropy":[2.2815,0.3464,0.1676,4.6319,0.5752,0.0068,3.5734,2.1293,6.8704,1.2834,0.05,9.4383,0.068,0.4529,0.6867,2.4768,0.8673,2.8726,0.1884,13.7162,0.0995,2.1764,0.2175,0.0786,0.1191,2.0943,2.9766,0.5237,2.7163,5.4377,10.3259,0.1642,0.0036,10.837,4.3989,2.9421,1.7294,16.8448,9.0909,9.2985,2.7772,4.1294,0.2523,0.4206,17.4118,6.6257,5.1293,6.2007,8.3526,7.1585,0.719,0.0036,1.6205,1.4524,4.6944,5.0296,1.5948,1.9777,9.9246,2.5667,3.0927,0.5556,1.9906,5.6771,0.0024,1.1177,7.2757,2.8781,0.0453,1.776,4.2505,0.3536,1.0219,0.7685,1.4345,3.2736,0.2519,10.778,1.3522,2.4883,0.0995,6.1496,5.0952,4.3417,6.2097,0.1663,3.3931,4.0376,2.1639,0.4916,3.9055,4.8636,6.7353,1.3594,2.8071,0.5215,1.1247,2.3827,4.3221,7.5891,1.0812,3.2622,6.4939,2.1089,4.1811,4.0226,1.7287,0.6139,0.5112,0.4492,6.5065,1.2262,1.3716,0.2828,0.0939,5.8958,5.7203,1.6503,1.883,3.3314,0.6016,3.6832,0.9148,2.5514,3.4179,0.6579,4.4074,1.0352,2.1696,2.892,7.4199,2.474,2.5706,2.5089,6.7318,0.036,1.7324,4.9513,1.2196,0.309,0.8883,1.6472,0.6935,1.0246,0.289,7.0809,5.7226,2.9803,5.3233,0.8525,3.1206,6.2052,0.8627,0.1411,1.3471,3.5412,2.5887,2.6408,5.4006,0.2931,2.6692,2.0079,0.7579,7.4715,1.6798,0.9882,7.186,0.4728,1.1321,5.1315,3.7862,4.1491,3.7826,2.6077,4.124,5.0225,0.517,0.8446,4.2088,2.4724,3.1044,4.0143,2.4612,3.1793,2.8879,5.2255,5.7374,2.0738,4.5569,9.0431,1.2479,1.2869,6.581,4.4624,0.6359,0.4301,2.0153,0.0482,7.7008,0.6785,1.3092,0.2495,5.5434,5.3718,1.4818,2.5354,2.2529,3.0966,3.9853,4.1387,0.8573,8.6594,5.4584,2.5702,2.4706,5.2483,4.4689,0.3847,0.1794,0.4547,4.372,1.8123,5.8855,0.6383,1.5427,0.3916,0.009,5.1831,0.197,2.8525,0.0017,0.7877,3.8415,6.4684,0.2345,4.3587,5.2573,0.852,6.5322,0.4508,0.4693,1.1178,3.4766,0.0006,1.6259,2.9569,0.0366,6.1831,7.3401,0.9711,2.1925,5.3897,5.3753,8.0101,2.7011,1.2676,4.5251,3.8646,3.213,1.7329,2.3816,4.5208,8.7733,0.2788,0.3321,3.0756,0.4061,0.4659,6.2008,1.9274,2.9906,3.9847,8.1134,0.5654,6.9581,0.7396,4.5436,1.3625,0.259,1.545,2.293,3.4918,1.6427,4.1152,1.638,1.3608,4.2083,0.6473,0.9898,3.173,0.2915,2.7425,0.7562,0.2115,2.7831,5.5829,1.1864,0.1355,1.9733,1.2034,3.9262,2.9034,6.3998,2.6412,0.1191,0.904,4.4896,4.5201,5.3946,6.0989,2.8932,4.8524,0.363,1.7923,7.7155,6.3367,0.677,1.7716,4.0355,0.0027,2.7628,0.0187,1.3002,2.2155,1.487,3.321,2.0518,0.8155,2.1993,6.0594,2.6509,6.4562,3.3983,0.6069,3.5264,7.4954,4.6706,1.6663,1.0367,0.4669,1.8384,0.1739,4.1152,0.7213,6.5988,5.1816,0.2643,0.9382,2.6413,1.8274,7.2072,6.6667,4.4954,2.8915,2.4203,1.9175,5.1397,7.417,2.2002,0.1046,2.557,2.0722,1.2093,3.7962,1.4052,0.4075,1.1765,0.0431,3.5244,1.9791,4.7393,0.0243,4.601,1.709,3.2808,0.3646,1.9344,3.8807,2.1256,1.8318,5.0149,0.2546,1.4107,2.3972,0.0103,6.2069,0.8346,1.3638,2.8517,0.2406,4.9864,2.1047,2.7213,1.4448,1.4315,0.8424,0.1754,0.1481]}

Thousands of migrants have died after trying to reach the European Union illegally.\nAn estimated 26,000 migrants reached Lampedusa in Italy in the first eleven months of 2012. The UN warned last week that if the Libyan crisis does not end, hundreds of thousands more could arrive by sea in Europe this year.\nThis website is owned and operated by United Auto Parts Inc (referred to as \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cUnited Auto Parts\u201d in these terms and conditions).\nPlease read these Terms and Conditions of Use carefully before using this site and before placing any order.

On a second ballot in June, it is not our objective that you vote for us. It is the goal for us that you vote for us, \u201d said Jens Spahn, the head of Germany\u2019s Health Ministry and also a cabinet minister.\nSpahn, who has maintained strong ties to Merkel in recent years, was asked about a meeting with his chancellor on July 1, the day after the EU\u2019s summer summit in Salzburg, Austria. That meeting might be the start of coalition talks.\n\u201c Maybe. We are talking. I don\u2019t know if there is an agreement. No, at this point, it isn\u2019t likely, \u201d he said.\nThe Social Democrats have also ruled out a merger with the Greens and other leftist parties to form an alternative parliament, but they have said there is more room for coalition talks with Merkel\u2019s centre-left coalition partners, the Christian Democrats and the Greens.\nSpahn said both sides were still far apart on economic and pension reforms such as a pension overhaul, the latter of which the SPD opposes.\nIt has also refused to support a planned increase in pension contributions from employers, which would cost around 4 trillion euros ($ 5 trillion ) a year.\nIf the SPD and the Greens accept that, then Germany could come closer, he said. But it still remains unlikely that the SPD can join the coalition.","token_len":399,"entropy":[9.8851,1.7617,0.0003,9.7667,11.7801,6.7857,1.2444,5.667,2.744,6.4375,0.1874,2.8413,9.1563,0.3535,1.7717,2.1678,0.5362,13.3781,4.8077,5.3492,0.9573,5.7189,1.9221,6.516,0.354,5.1253,7.3213,0.8126,3.3626,3.1815,2.5695,3.9769,5.7324,2.6699,3.3295,0.035,1.5786,4.6672,1.3732,0.2811,0.6814,20.0106,15.2365,8.0341,3.0545,2.8001,0.1739,3.854,4.9308,1.1668,2.7003,2.7801,2.9249,2.7754,2.8093,0.6342,3.4279,1.4197,2.9551,3.2855,5.5707,3.2302,2.2733,6.0146,6.497,0.0237,11.0741,0.0995,0.0074,3.3282,0.7628,7.6137,1.209,0.1356,0.2087,0.3572,0.0106,1.741,6.0497,5.5302,1.7109,0.2025,4.6076,0.0391,0.5512,0.1025,0.0906,0.2473,0.0316,0.0009,0.0322,0.0074,0.1229,1.6683,0.3037,10.9516,4.7854,5.8596,7.0568,0.5693,2.184,5.4125,5.338,3.5714,2.6686,0.2265,1.6505,0.6316,0.8685,5.0728,4.467,6.2725,6.1351,1.9821,3.037,0.4458,4.8887,1.5972,2.9448,8.9702,8.1012,4.3055,6.3724,2.1781,0.8544,3.1471,1.4647,3.0001,0.5156,2.5204,4.2895,3.3901,1.4232,2.8894,0.7014,1.1602,0.3841,0.1656,1.9175,7.2398,5.8109,4.5503,5.092,1.3237,5.104,2.6901,0.864,1.9671,2.6769,0.0059,3.2318,2.3669,0.0249,0.02,8.0577,1.2525,3.6623,5.6297,1.5979,5.5534,0.5388,0.6066,0.5921,4.6146,0.0072,2.0622,0.6956,2.2385,7.1473,4.9098,0.7124,1.4953,0.634,3.4614,1.3982,0.9521,0.1661,3.2843,3.0254,1.4491,3.1461,4.9427,1.8799,4.6464,4.6455,1.4601,5.504,3.1508,1.9197,3.4953,0.6566,1.0101,0.7885,4.5653,9.8891,0.1754,0.0212,6.4128,1.036,0.8158,9.9439,0.004,0.0001,1.1311,1.2876,0.7174,5.9609,0.5848,6.0207,1.8951,1.9745,2.7252,0.045,7.3226,0.3756,1.6675,0.4971,2.4386,0.5789,8.3051,2.916,3.2316,2.2379,3.3036,4.8318,3.6636,2.0646,0.7605,0.776,0.0703,0.3621,3.2852,2.8112,0.8873,2.5936,1.2115,1.7077,5.1887,1.4163,5.5661,1.499,0.5673,1.0102,2.0784,3.5601,0.5871,0.1282,0.0046,7.3373,2.0891,2.4597,0.4865,1.6842,0.3518,0.3527,0.5323,3.2061,3.1085,0.0819,2.0408,3.9956,6.0392,0.0766,1.4619,5.0167,0.5046,0.399,1.8549,2.8744,4.0188,4.6772,0.4728,4.109,0.4848,2.5819,3.128,5.7768,1.4476,2.6504,2.515,1.8901,2.9812,4.056,0.8498,5.3701,3.9242,0.4074,4.9403,0.8159,3.3959,3.537,3.1173,0.0063,0.0083,6.4893,0.0526,0.9844,2.4077,0.6372,2.0933,3.4657,2.224,1.2443,0.6195,0.4089,1.1069,0.4059,0.3242,2.8876,0.0136,1.0615,6.6001,1.8358,2.2894,3.3314,5.4729,0.1738,0.3577,1.7581,3.3207,6.6263,3.0168,7.4507,0.0068,2.6591,3.4711,3.042,1.8774,3.288,7.282,1.1688,0.0174,3.5154,1.3464,4.9959,0.2749,0.4957,4.7485,3.559,1.8193,6.0405,0.0944,3.128,1.1595,5.0366,4.3317,0.1227,3.6919,1.2332,2.5333,7.0692,1.8274,2.3285,1.5518,3.9274,4.7036,3.5929,4.6743,0.2119,1.2535,7.5378,3.446,3.6771,1.0083,0.0132,0.947,0.5018,4.9047,1.1078,1.6651,2.3744,0.8198,0.5248,7.1074,2.8069,2.3662,2.4045,4.1962,1.8098,5.0221,4.5335,6.0357,2.1666,0.2395,0.2776,3.4464,2.6145,4.2642,3.2078,6.1669,1.0186,1.2489,2.1637,2.3346,4.8014,0.627,1.9751,1.8886]}
