It would not say what would result if a reporter who accepted materials from a suspected suspect was indicted.","token_len":146,"entropy":[5.1643,9.05,2.8783,1.5596,9.7122,10.6786,8.8143,2.6743,2.2526,3.065,3.7327,0.0723,0.0842,0.0207,1.8042,0.9128,1.716,0.0014,1.7128,2.1004,7.3628,1.7429,6.1252,6.7245,1.2984,1.1613,5.0197,1.6154,0.5786,7.9172,4.9587,0.0586,1.8361,8.7573,5.8181,0.3064,0.0038,1.3061,4.8547,3.3166,1.1381,5.6291,0.1003,1.0671,16.662,5.9814,6.1596,0.7088,2.1936,6.8226,0.6686,1.9233,3.3677,0.4169,5.2741,0.9349,1.9854,2.9672,0.4878,8.3397,6.7286,7.2599,5.8341,7.5816,1.2368,13.7139,0.3364,0.3553,0.4215,15.7393,4.244,2.7992,4.0401,1.6889,2.288,6.0333,0.505,3.4814,0.0166,0.4835,0.3046,2.849,0.0085,0.1413,1.0653,2.2249,4.9229,2.2765,5.9496,6.6096,0.0078,0.7701,1.2416,2.3327,3.1944,3.5809,5.3726,0.0006,0.002,0.0012,2.8079,0.6045,4.049,5.5529,0.2644,4.9567,6.1331,3.028,1.1169,4.6733,0.2004,2.9122,4.4477,2.9613,4.9101,5.5832,4.8564,2.4053,2.8951,1.221,3.121,0.0012,1.4874,0.7229,0.9284,3.559,3.2116,2.7076,1.5092,1.9538,3.1538,5.758,1.7545,2.6181,1.18,3.5125,8.8018,6.7452,1.5767,1.2953,5.4571,7.3508,1.9446,5.2846,0.9047]}

It is easy for a human being to meet online and this is something that can be done through a simple webcam.","token_len":162,"entropy":[6.9248,0.1746,1.8286,6.9041,7.9867,2.4864,9.4175,4.7776,2.0883,0.2899,3.1937,5.6278,5.3824,0.2894,1.312,1.2417,7.7727,6.3085,0.1279,5.3389,0.0983,0.0073,1.0469,2.2414,1.0461,2.8962,5.8068,0.7593,0.0378,0.1137,3.1378,5.0589,1.0322,2.8404,0.2351,3.3751,4.94,1.9057,1.0817,3.458,4.288,0.3809,4.4691,0.0564,4.3364,7.5643,0.0158,1.7506,0.5541,2.5995,3.2474,2.5568,5.0656,5.0561,3.6758,2.3099,6.9588,1.3843,2.352,0.0264,4.2851,2.6271,5.2923,0.001,18.6535,3.9624,4.1523,0.8193,1.9311,1.2132,1.3464,6.5387,1.6467,2.7623,1.3172,2.9504,1.045,4.6916,0.2686,2.9024,0.0805,0.2813,2.3557,3.0647,1.4069,0.8419,2.3507,0.8265,1.1584,6.1704,1.5634,2.6545,4.838,5.3822,2.3802,2.8402,0.4922,6.6218,9.3425,6.6469,0.2395,1.0845,1.1067,1.5397,1.5746,4.5831,1.9077,4.0307,3.9445,4.0486,0.41,4.3805,0.838,3.1725,0.8117,1.8562,4.6227,1.8336,7.0282,1.4266,4.3519,2.6765,0.4291,1.786,1.9679,6.8819,0.2677,5.6906,1.2648,4.9086,1.6938,0.5057,7.0558,5.0827,2.3913,1.4574,0.0014,0.2371,3.7392,2.5723,4.9878,2.4723,2.6406,6.1365,0.5104,0.2238,7.4013,3.3797,1.6742,5.792,1.0688,3.3654,0.699,3.1142,0.9913,1.7104,4.3536,2.0461,4.0551,7.9947,1.2059]}

The Arkansas General Assembly passed the law in 2015, which bans women from taking the drug in the second trimester of pregnancy.

While the Five Star Movement has a smaller electoral base than the coalition, polls suggest that they could win enough seats to form their own government after the current left-wing government falls.","token_len":171,"entropy":[6.0117,0.8725,8.7587,4.458,9.2408,13.151,8.99,0.6993,0.1645,2.7645,0.0747,1.0962,6.794,4.6357,0.3613,4.4283,0.1764,0.0055,3.1833,5.7296,2.073,0.0898,0.2165,2.9927,4.3505,7.6444,3.3306,9.6024,1.388,1.4716,4.9051,2.5536,0.681,1.6532,3.8403,0.0536,1.4136,1.7003,5.4239,0.0007,0.5719,1.8856,2.0954,2.5137,3.0474,4.1797,5.6565,1.2263,4.0042,2.6787,3.5626,0.9901,4.4827,0.0005,3.3932,4.977,3.1808,1.6735,0.1135,3.1815,0.5106,1.9326,1.1898,2.8732,3.2678,0.5472,8.0027,2.3095,4.5741,0.7761,3.0599,2.1227,2.1882,0.028,0.3869,1.1643,4.753,0.6409,0.8263,25.3,5.0468,5.0923,5.452,2.5525,5.8785,1.4552,0.4086,5.5484,3.6595,2.9073,2.416,1.4585,2.0826,1.5733,1.9535,5.4716,1.6277,5.5764,3.8145,1.5511,7.0885,2.5696,4.1958,2.7603,0.1978,1.3732,6.6759,2.3387,1.5786,5.2245,7.3939,7.1134,1.4098,3.1709,3.5981,8.0389,0.3577,1.2213,7.8059,0.0335,4.4227,0.7512,7.4841,0.155,0.0668,2.3481,6.7908,2.5286,5.9205,0.0236,0.5994,5.3228,0.8118,1.0025,4.8875,1.392,1.4903,0.0275,0.2931,1.7147,3.051,5.5772,5.0552,0.6621,0.8918,0.7147,4.7704,0.9317,4.3926,1.169,0.8198,3.0622,1.7448,1.3967,3.6636,0.5775,0.4254,1.8493,3.9073,0.1464,0.5923,4.7177,1.2722,4.5527,7.6837,0.3812,0.4138,1.2627,3.8384,1.302]}

The moves, which could make the PD vote fragmented by almost 15 percent compared with last year's parliamentary election, occurred in the wake of a vote in the PD's regional parliament in which more than 100 members joined Renzi's fellow coalition party, the People's Alliance for the Movements (PAM). The PD is set to split over the question of supporting Renzi's push for deeper and more pro-economy reforms or continuing with more popular measures for welfare states. The PD is expected to go for a change in government.

The Pentagon on Wednesday said it would put anti-missile systems on top of existing missile defense systems along the U.S. Pacific coast before the end of year to protect the country from North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.","token_len":173,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,7.5963,5.61,0.0481,2.582,1.1858,2.2713,1.5961,7.8076,1.0263,2.7223,10.346,2.0766,5.9605,2.0437,0.9698,5.4352,0.8816,4.9453,4.9349,3.5688,0.0032,0.2088,0.0061,2.6902,1.4195,7.3939,9.1709,0.8208,0.7616,2.1441,4.0332,2.1653,1.9886,4.2523,0.0829,7.6647,13.5333,1.1364,8.2139,0.1665,0.444,1.3233,0.4115,4.1591,3.7039,6.1459,0.3493,2.9117,2.3475,2.8159,2.4674,0.002,5.2768,5.0264,3.5202,0.289,3.1881,0.0546,11.4483,8.2282,1.9662,0.8098,3.2176,1.1215,2.2071,2.9365,6.5312,4.372,2.0634,4.6355,3.5923,1.5171,7.029,2.9361,5.1806,1.1043,4.3132,0.0019,4.7495,1.4363,0.0013,0.1307,2.4344,2.4877,3.3389,4.2869,1.1975,1.4342,0.0138,2.2394,2.6211,4.7368,3.8529,7.1312,1.6011,7.2545,1.6088,0.133,3.847,0.2036,5.6231,7.2589,0.3494,3.6417,1.4998,1.3372,5.5245,4.7866,1.9762,5.7196,1.3503,5.9588,1.7683,0.8095,0.5276,1.7471,2.3726,6.38,0.0036,0.1383,0.231,1.7886,2.7883,6.5426,3.9515,1.6877,0.5712,1.9437,5.1171,7.9599,0.0006,0.0284,0.0044,1.8328,1.3637,6.1123,0.0055,0.7339,1.9559,0.6289,0.2672,6.0942,0.8156,2.0066,0.0007,0.0014,1.4966,2.67,1.1513,5.251,1.6946,1.07,0.0007,6.2949,3.9978,2.438,1.6304,1.5919,0.2929,2.4236,0.3004,1.4567,3.5526,0.7852,0.6093,0.3712,4.0408,0.2415]}

There was a hint that May was on the back foot, with some calling on the Prime Minister to resign and others saying she risks losing her majority in Britain's lower house of parliament, the House of Commons.","token_len":177,"entropy":[8.1133,11.7299,0.0051,7.7032,3.2836,8.5818,4.9368,0.0003,0.2514,21.7565,5.1358,2.0341,0.5709,0.0428,0.4683,5.5484,2.423,6.6976,5.5438,0.3604,12.8433,5.3008,0.9251,0.9842,4.558,1.3611,2.6834,7.5029,6.675,1.0257,4.0147,0.3212,6.0121,6.6848,1.1996,0.9454,3.4336,0.9129,4.5803,9.5664,0.5922,5.7777,6.6153,0.4602,5.5867,1.8205,3.1673,1.2934,7.4638,0.393,7.4291,4.8324,2.1112,1.8979,6.3919,5.1939,1.3098,3.6835,2.4985,5.8081,2.2719,5.12,0.0212,3.6163,1.4386,0.4886,1.6238,16.6308,2.6732,2.3757,3.1775,2.0414,0.1102,5.5785,3.736,5.3411,0.4696,4.5818,5.2306,4.1698,2.4555,4.4079,4.569,3.1427,0.9742,3.512,6.8148,7.2077,3.4654,3.5319,6.215,1.0351,6.4819,10.3853,0.2139,2.0189,10.8393,0.5625,3.3553,7.1894,5.9202,2.8574,7.2451,0.2035,1.1574,1.5153,5.671,0.5887,0.837,3.6139,1.5941,5.4601,3.7867,5.4074,4.081,0.9331,5.7002,2.4427,5.0071,1.316,0.2328,1.1576,9.2084,4.7464,2.972,1.0624,0.7635,1.3635,0.234,1.8759,0.0378,5.9049,1.3445,0.2023,5.8562,2.1112,1.8296,4.4144,2.0122,1.5963,2.1982,4.3676,1.2358,3.3946,0.1707,2.5324,1.756,2.9215,5.0936,2.6928,1.5146,3.7746,0.0057,0.1555,4.0341,2.6723,0.8973,1.8678,1.0101,8.7958,2.2912,1.2583,3.5791,1.6131,5.365,0.7814,5.4397,0.0237,1.6718,0.2167,2.7977,2.0112,1.9971,0.002,0.4148,0.2522]}

It would effectively cut pensions of workers retiring between now and 2029. It would also require millions of workers retiring later in the decade to work longer. It also would change conditions for the poorest, who are already facing tough choices about how to put food on the table.","token_len":177,"entropy":[6.5616,2.863,5.5819,11.185,8.3824,3.2456,0.009,0.0024,2.7651,7.3819,0.3225,11.4165,2.3776,5.3861,2.7324,0.1175,4.4336,1.2426,5.9564,7.1896,0.4113,2.8675,1.5813,10.006,4.2409,1.078,0.6292,2.9483,1.7136,4.9905,5.8437,7.1404,3.169,5.3745,4.8916,5.4168,3.304,0.4163,10.6317,2.5772,2.3278,4.1094,1.1987,1.4948,2.6431,1.7198,4.9981,2.7995,1.1035,4.3738,4.226,2.6533,1.954,2.1181,1.6755,2.8616,2.8731,3.3621,1.439,2.4404,1.5986,3.0619,0.4609,2.7007,0.0031,0.9652,5.5132,1.5998,0.154,2.884,4.1126,4.4615,0.3061,0.5622,2.2614,2.9674,0.3592,2.1703,4.2405,0.3011,0.6608,2.2273,2.6093,0.4059,1.1622,0.0068,6.4949,5.3204,1.8549,7.4826,3.1575,3.0436,0.8736,6.5188,1.0634,8.6231,0.3407,4.7275,5.0642,2.031,4.7814,3.3004,6.0757,4.2865,3.3191,2.6754,0.3249,1.9497,0.6636,0.0016,4.2017,0.8924,0.4908,1.7996,4.7219,2.9634,1.9052,1.7507,0.1172,3.4097,1.9739,2.2336,5.0509,2.9286,4.7287,3.3358,2.9626,3.7505,3.54,8.9022,4.6185,4.1419,0.003,3.6565,2.8148,1.1378,3.2272,0.765,0.5867,3.6048,6.4293,0.2272,3.2963,7.9237,4.8622,1.1475,1.9356,1.8789,0.2342,5.0303,2.3114,2.8678,3.5081,1.9786,0.6092,5.3785,6.6866,0.4275,2.8965,4.7541,2.8986,1.9981,1.9711,2.6256,3.082,5.5314,2.9815,1.7299,1.4177,0.1643,6.3477,3.8219,0.1757,0.0993,0.0272,0.7932]}

That's more than the economy in Germany and Japan combined.\nThe debt ceiling is a legislative requirement, under which the government owes only as much as the amount it has raised the debt ceiling, the deficit, or a combination.","token_len":178,"entropy":[6.1478,0.1531,0.0703,0.0909,5.1102,5.2859,10.7016,2.7929,2.1122,0.5675,4.1365,4.6607,2.3382,6.6669,7.893,4.4689,5.362,2.8992,1.927,2.9527,1.268,3.6261,3.8008,2.9945,2.3646,0.1344,0.0798,3.707,2.0196,2.2552,0.0212,3.3556,0.7361,0.4332,0.1267,4.1707,1.9154,0.3313,0.4896,11.3556,2.3991,1.9005,1.5958,0.0003,6.5224,2.4929,0.3102,0.122,0.0824,0.2439,4.0924,0.6893,0.3256,2.1015,5.1133,0.7106,2.2195,2.3843,1.2785,4.4247,1.3548,2.5469,0.7954,1.0456,4.473,4.0511,2.2026,0.0017,3.6152,5.6821,0.014,1.1746,0.7234,4.9596,3.3336,2.0256,2.9296,2.9218,1.9575,1.7483,0.4125,1.4596,4.8927,7.3096,6.3075,1.378,3.6353,0.6078,3.5859,0.5727,4.2589,5.0061,1.8482,0.5348,6.9888,0.8941,3.2535,1.6583,3.9101,0.0045,0.1277,3.6994,1.6124,2.0113,2.8453,0.0046,2.8879,0.2229,3.1815,2.3397,1.6964,0.9717,0.4261,1.5814,2.4491,3.3194,4.664,2.0172,5.5187,5.5695,4.7253,0.8793,3.0542,0.6791,1.5218,1.5095,0.2105,0.0008,1.1348,0.2286,0.8993,2.5367,1.4286,3.0101,0.0518,1.5791,5.0113,5.2517,8.5393,1.6918,2.5106,0.95,0.8299,0.3454,1.6936,3.7094,0.9218,1.899,2.5209,6.4592,3.7221,2.9485,6.2121,0.8387,1.6491,1.0589,6.2503,5.7732,6.5725,0.0312,0.1074,1.9744,3.7441,1.3309,2.4283,4.4977,5.3556,1.1256,0.6338,2.5686,3.7545,6.2018,2.3312,1.1639,3.7311,2.0679,3.4247]}

More flights would be possible, though the new runway would not be able to handle more large passenger aircraft. Heathrow is also likely to have to make further changes to its air traffic control system. This will require a second review. The aviation company of the future will require a third runway, it said, and that it would have to carry out a second environmental impact assessment. The consultation will run until July. In April it opened a consultation on how to handle jet noise. The airport authority said noise levels are currently the same as in previous years after moving back the runway for an extra mile to get rid of noise from a nearby river.","token_len":182,"entropy":[8.5181,5.44,6.4308,6.2295,3.2662,5.814,3.0537,0.8626,1.1377,2.9345,5.5903,2.6564,1.6302,5.9756,0.1396,1.1077,11.3928,12.858,5.3913,0.4236,1.6248,3.3897,0.9206,7.4898,0.0626,6.9207,0.9053,4.8969,1.13,0.0959,8.0787,1.1215,7.7626,0.0152,0.0679,0.0004,1.4549,6.1032,1.8025,2.2753,2.5294,0.178,4.3967,3.4679,1.5554,5.2038,3.9177,5.3996,2.7697,0.1801,0.1553,1.2006,0.6527,7.2603,9.947,1.3905,1.1001,3.5585,2.3892,4.87,1.9999,4.9388,1.1872,0.6018,2.047,0.9774,3.1888,0.001,3.3553,3.2555,6.1731,4.0174,2.0457,0.6936,5.5531,0.0001,2.8675,2.1869,5.3885,0.0023,3.5469,0.1858,3.6282,3.4203,1.2962,0.4132,0.6036,3.9993,0.5163,0.612,0.5755,2.4106,4.2518,2.1195,2.8028,1.9429,4.2227,5.0366,3.013,2.0694,6.0754,4.6539,7.7889,1.3334,3.5045,2.4026,6.2073,1.5225,3.1079,0.1936,2.0088,4.0212,0.7017,1.6241,2.0885,3.3229,4.1179,1.0994,2.5277,0.1345,5.3389,0.8477,1.7142,2.5983,5.5302,3.0773,0.208,1.0696,1.8952,4.7871,1.5114,3.4986,0.987,3.6106,1.6433,4.4046,3.6353,3.96,5.5206,1.1307,2.8604,0.4003,3.6789,0.7528,3.9731,8.2095,4.6954,2.0242,1.7097,3.328,8.1427,1.1357,5.258,1.8816,4.2155,3.7168,4.3454,3.5958,0.437,1.9539,3.4096,0.7399,6.7042,7.256,5.0183,4.8129,3.8073,4.3097,3.6658,2.4968,4.2043,2.5479,5.4508,2.6968,0.0023,2.2916,2.7924,3.8015,4.5946,6.3949,0.3316]}

Blood timber trader Guus Schouten is being sought on suspicion of violating the Netherlands\u2019 sanctions against warlords in Sierra Leone, said a police spokesman, adding that the trader is expected to be extradited. Dutch prosecutors have issued a request for his arrest on suspicion that Schouten helped arms for the war in Sierra Leone, a source familiar with the case said.

Merkel s government is already struggling to make headway on reforms of its refugee programme, something it needs to meet one of its campaign pledges and which threatens to tarnish a reputation for bringing about stability in Germany after the last years of European turmoil. Merkel visited Hungary on Thursday for bilateral talks that highlighted the challenges that her country is facing. She said there was still no guarantee she could make the necessary reforms for an extension of Germany s refugee intake. Merkel told state radio she hopes to decide by Thursday evening if she can find common ground with centre-right Chancellor Armin Laschet, whose party lost 11 seats and six seats in the national election from July.

Jackson - who teaches finance law at Columbia and previously served as a senior White House official, U.S. senator and a federal judge - would be the first African American member of the SEC. He has expressed support for imposing more regulation on Wall Street and wants to push for greater oversight of digital asset regulation, a person familiar with his mindset said.

The US law states that any one of the two may ask for reciprocity. Beijing views Taipei as an annexed province. The law also allows the US to set up naval installations on the island. Taiwanese naval vessels enjoy a year-round pass through the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese military claims maritime control over the so-called Eastern China Sea and says the passage through its waters could be restricted. But China insists it wants peaceful exchanges through the strait. China says the law threatens its national sovereignty and integrity. The US law does not prohibit vessels from doing business with Taiwan but it is clearly directed at restricting those exchanges in order to force Beijing to recognise the island as a separate country.

The government has wanted to move the council away from political influence, which it says is the cause of corruption in the system. In June, the president s Justice Minister said the government s top objective in bringing about reforms in the judiciary was to bring it into line with European standards, including requiring the president to appoint a commissioner for the judiciary. Poland last summer adopted the European Convention on Remuneration of Judges, a measure approved by the Supreme Council of the Judiciary and adopted by Congress in July.

Bush, and their respective sons.\nThe book claims that while Trump's first two years in office were very successful, \"the son's reign has turned out to be less successful than his father's.\" Trump, he explained, is \"no longer a leader of the free world.\"","token_len":196,"entropy":[6.5584,1.0476,5.818,0.1572,0.2412,3.0564,2.7688,3.8419,2.9856,0.8053,0.1012,0.0643,7.1874,0.3991,4.7213,0.6513,10.6875,1.4494,4.2874,0.1844,5.1068,0.707,1.309,6.4809,1.9836,4.93,0.5704,1.0782,1.2884,0.2899,2.2925,0.8795,10.1864,0.3032,6.69,3.9434,0.0215,3.6155,0.0005,0.0013,0.0018,0.3234,0.289,0.4127,25.8423,2.5561,6.9174,1.444,2.573,3.3314,4.4631,4.2579,4.5467,2.8322,4.2737,2.6981,0.0323,6.4229,4.3958,4.5513,5.7672,5.5956,0.4492,0.0004,0.5761,4.1793,0.0012,3.2269,0.1622,3.7571,3.3942,0.2643,0.0298,0.1956,0.0207,0.0279,0.0788,0.014,1.6556,1.2204,5.226,3.7531,0.0844,2.0344,4.5594,6.8568,1.9787,7.2074,2.3493,3.783,3.8593,3.5639,2.3093,4.0763,0.9357,2.3352,3.0118,4.5301,5.067,5.2974,0.1061,3.0914,6.2631,0.01,1.5336,1.5827,0.0024,2.841,1.9517,4.7843,5.166,1.1978,0.0254,2.7922,3.1193,0.7747,3.8653,2.0153,1.0112,0.2251,0.4581,0.0003,4.1432,1.4424,4.6993,0.3237,5.8687,1.8588,2.4336,0.706,0.0011,3.0717,0.0035,0.0244,0.2159,1.2987,0.3369,0.0016,0.0699,2.3186,2.1395,3.097,3.9897,6.4532,2.09,0.92,2.9994,1.0372,4.1687,0.61,3.6931,3.7502,2.0087,4.798,2.4413,2.7994,0.6299,0.1133,0.7123,4.764,2.4847,0.3005,3.6671,1.9604,5.8055,3.3521,5.553,3.7157,5.1874,2.2336,0.1895,0.1096,3.0813,0.9808,1.6171,1.1092,0.0855,0.0514,0.8194,3.5641,2.6342,2.9133,7.1293,0.1029,2.9931,1.1195,5.6465,0.6392,1.7798,3.9681,1.4754,0.4996,1.3646,0.0108,1.0938]}
