Here\u2019s the guide to resist temptation when you are faced with the urge of indulging in an unhealthy food.","token_len":141,"entropy":[8.5981,13.5312,7.2867,0.9871,5.6628,8.8468,2.1845,8.7729,2.3327,4.4237,2.9553,4.3964,3.8701,3.3702,2.7754,6.5337,0.746,3.0421,0.4362,5.0321,5.4955,2.2152,2.8161,4.3676,1.4672,5.0002,2.7307,2.7736,0.1439,6.3243,3.8729,0.8435,5.3475,2.6766,5.4563,6.0449,4.761,0.8448,2.304,5.8332,0.0378,1.5395,4.6585,3.0221,2.0573,5.1881,4.4384,5.5226,0.0134,0.9537,1.6271,1.9133,4.0152,3.3731,6.0467,1.6167,4.2576,5.4225,0.078,4.8907,5.4815,1.668,1.0205,7.5266,0.745,3.5083,6.757,7.3768,4.4167,6.3316,2.3918,4.2276,4.2393,0.7578,3.5953,0.7166,5.7808,4.1823,5.1808,7.7459,3.9,1.0661,3.5613,5.766,2.2756,3.8962,1.838,1.3307,6.4326,1.0796,1.0423,2.1514,2.7095,10.2933,2.1115,1.5699,1.6788,3.4026,2.8147,4.2172,3.1307,3.3149,4.6769,0.3982,0.5175,1.3507,2.4567,0.3552,6.3107,3.3591,4.8258,2.6343,9.3041,0.4529,2.91,0.5772,5.3049,17.0701,7.4219,5.2531,2.1003,6.7075,1.0294,5.4358,3.875,5.455,1.5089,0.519,1.4343,0.0278,1.6415,0.3984,0.8308,3.5333,0.1072,1.7622,2.1886,4.8806,1.7862,0.903]}

The only way to survive is to work together as a team, and many make such efforts.","token_len":161,"entropy":[7.8843,4.77,0.5627,3.3847,7.7747,4.3204,3.1898,8.0077,0.8019,3.8732,6.1815,4.8385,3.1838,10.375,0.0775,1.1316,7.1139,0.0496,0.0022,0.0094,0.0085,7.7246,1.098,2.5095,6.126,1.3762,0.7453,6.8902,3.04,7.5214,4.1362,1.4945,2.2698,2.7905,7.4404,5.3995,4.3597,0.2374,1.048,6.0388,0.1478,0.1338,0.0203,12.8219,0.0063,0.8179,5.2147,4.1095,5.7247,1.8385,3.5186,0.1576,5.3601,1.3203,3.0753,4.0304,6.6013,1.0914,0.5746,0.5349,2.6443,6.8547,6.3597,2.7326,3.7383,7.0642,3.3441,0.5098,0.6867,5.453,3.631,0.0515,2.9966,6.3637,1.3754,0.9958,6.5768,0.1037,1.7923,4.3967,1.5452,7.1679,0.0006,1.5002,3.8513,0.6539,3.7226,5.1846,1.7976,3.341,1.7771,2.8607,0.1258,2.18,2.5592,0.8597,5.1294,3.4695,0.219,1.0652,2.8879,1.2211,5.6968,2.2359,3.5113,1.4607,8.1131,2.7396,3.6404,0.4004,0.0534,0.0288,2.376,0.6186,6.0886,1.411,4.7073,0.0065,3.2155,4.8126,0.3275,0.3348,3.1435,2.5742,4.7323,0.4568,1.4097,5.4226,1.7347,6.8146,3.4357,6.2176,6.7594,5.684,2.8293,1.1342,5.473,0.2039,6.0385,0.6651,1.6394,2.191,3.6984,2.2823,0.47,1.0614,0.6809,0.3824,3.1037,0.3833,3.0718,0.5673,1.1438,1.5305,1.5987,5.2245,8.1493,6.245,2.4195,1.5161]}

What is even more alarming, and what I have experienced myself, is that the garbage is getting closer to the coastlines. Many cities are at risk. Some cities are located at 1,000 kilometers from the nearest garbage dump. \u201c","token_len":165,"entropy":[6.0155,0.8326,8.9033,3.4439,15.3792,4.8767,0.0443,1.44,1.1158,7.629,2.6223,6.9408,3.0369,0.0882,0.0001,11.5505,0.0597,7.7874,2.0743,3.2635,3.5893,3.2115,5.4175,5.7152,0.4007,1.5077,4.3478,2.4655,5.0923,5.5546,6.4206,1.1775,1.8771,1.7469,6.29,1.2788,2.1241,4.2222,1.391,1.5976,5.3582,0.7737,0.7794,4.2542,2.2777,1.0398,5.2364,1.6514,0.9482,4.0796,1.1788,11.6641,8.5711,2.7136,4.3904,4.6706,3.4875,2.9664,6.0467,1.0778,0.9487,6.5112,6.877,10.4908,3.0449,0.7075,1.0635,6.8616,3.6665,0.2176,2.7257,3.902,0.7075,1.5699,6.4681,3.7808,0.8063,1.5288,4.7694,5.0307,0.942,1.2095,2.0421,0.4546,3.2085,0.166,0.3936,1.5683,6.3761,2.7481,1.0499,0.3563,0.9914,6.3395,17.2253,7.9941,5.0491,2.0351,0.9499,1.6665,5.2768,0.4387,4.4177,5.7423,6.0432,2.1584,4.1455,6.28,2.21,0.1278,3.0315,1.9354,1.6968,0.2172,1.3309,1.232,4.5676,2.0731,4.1071,0.5275,2.887,2.7432,4.124,3.6025,2.4422,2.6681,4.7164,4.5374,1.4564,0.2092,0.6024,2.0063,3.2646,1.4575,4.725,4.393,0.8021,0.6888,4.3036,3.1087,1.1261,5.3284,5.9736,1.4582,5.5397,2.2383,2.6517,4.0004,3.3694,0.8337,5.9135,3.0466,6.6006,0.9976,0.5445,4.6475,1.7777,0.9521,4.1776,5.5196,0.4162,0.7624,6.544,1.2183]}

I will try to ask if you want.","token_len":172,"entropy":[11.8517,3.3695,10.4703,0.0258,0.8694,2.43,3.4391,11.8472,4.1988,12.5089,8.9869,6.9755,1.406,0.9037,2.5662,1.4812,1.9752,4.2198,8.9023,0.2117,11.1271,4.3127,2.9094,0.3684,5.8148,4.0778,1.8139,1.1087,4.8614,3.5889,2.9539,6.6132,1.2001,7.1053,0.8291,2.7577,0.6273,5.8523,3.2111,1.5482,5.4071,0.3436,6.6035,1.9812,0.8466,4.4134,0.7135,4.7284,4.2501,3.8123,0.9122,4.1538,3.9705,1.4214,4.1303,4.3541,2.1954,3.2581,1.7491,5.6933,0.5369,7.2207,1.082,7.3207,1.5586,2.044,4.7015,0.001,4.2329,1.8126,3.0894,5.144,0.6195,1.5535,2.5983,2.8603,4.8051,0.254,0.4459,8.3858,4.7111,1.4006,3.9522,0.5399,4.3064,4.2393,2.6613,2.843,1.3632,4.5274,0.5703,4.6627,2.814,0.6758,1.1354,2.5038,0.7753,5.2309,1.1828,1.2148,2.2985,3.586,2.8764,4.7549,2.6922,5.3506,3.1042,1.1047,1.3982,3.3456,6.4325,4.8375,0.6242,3.3589,4.1706,0.2092,6.6756,5.5338,5.1243,2.3599,0.7761,5.7965,1.6395,3.2503,7.0667,0.001,3.0619,0.103,0.285,3.1371,4.2143,3.4279,0.5128,0.0355,6.4022,2.0457,4.1456,1.3797,1.7458,6.0104,3.4987,4.0852,2.8194,1.1697,1.5179,4.3829,1.3081,2.1254,5.4741,1.5131,0.9605,2.8311,4.2833,0.1068,0.1851,3.6545,5.2685,5.8814,4.471,6.6551,3.7202,4.0467,2.9928,3.4318,1.9621,0.3355,6.0126,5.1217,1.507,4.128,8.6801]}

It will probably be set on Earth but this is a very general statement and likely to be modified with each book.\nAs stated in the comments, I don't think it will be completely in the past, but that's a simple way to answer the question.","token_len":172,"entropy":[10.49,3.1669,0.0007,2.9703,5.8902,3.3824,7.597,4.3115,1.6531,4.0075,1.6402,5.3539,4.8992,3.6586,0.8682,0.0031,4.2408,5.9259,2.91,0.0001,3.0614,6.0921,0.6753,5.8571,10.1187,5.6447,8.2568,5.9037,3.4681,0.0864,2.923,2.4948,1.7343,1.9769,3.2765,1.4374,2.4988,20.8508,5.537,0.565,4.9606,6.1478,14.3631,1.4589,6.8888,3.6,0.6007,0.0003,5.1092,2.4061,5.9814,5.0205,0.2139,0.9609,8.0153,1.0494,2.3165,3.5187,3.0879,6.0656,0.0007,0.0392,1.5563,6.6779,2.3624,1.0737,4.3343,6.7354,2.438,2.3986,4.5121,0.1439,6.6728,3.8514,1.2218,3.2489,0.0392,1.7047,0.5109,1.2069,3.077,1.4503,1.2781,4.9352,3.25,5.1597,2.1882,2.3599,3.5591,0.7416,0.7402,2.4164,1.5567,4.6049,2.0239,0.1967,1.1737,2.226,5.445,4.0303,3.1337,1.9723,2.9194,0.3813,0.8401,18.6178,2.4651,7.5295,4.4542,1.5058,0.675,4.4346,3.9254,3.5992,4.4308,4.5573,2.2944,1.0262,2.3543,4.4851,3.5189,1.0181,6.4331,2.9414,5.2835,3.7496,4.4239,1.4699,2.0829,2.7991,4.1362,4.8836,2.2256,6.2583,2.1951,0.8376,6.4151,4.0817,4.2983,3.5517,0.9216,0.5383,18.2235,4.9005,1.8867,0.6345,4.3053,0.7743,2.5322,2.4053,0.0005,1.0939,1.9648,3.2196,0.4853,4.9233,5.5454,1.9759,5.3943,1.7989,1.3517,3.5411,1.3453,2.3578,7.0711,2.8098,0.8333,5.2689,1.6205,0.3538,0.8389]}

The story should be based on his\/her experiences.You need to develop a unique and beautiful story that can capture the viewer even if he has no idea what a character does.","token_len":173,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,4.4823,5.5607,2.8584,2.0032,6.6977,6.52,3.8488,4.6318,5.9406,3.6411,0.763,0.4836,0.808,3.824,3.9051,3.9847,4.907,1.4183,1.4559,5.5853,3.0593,3.7086,6.3138,1.7369,6.7189,4.6702,1.43,1.3709,2.2635,3.505,0.6255,4.9274,2.1539,0.9279,5.8704,2.8757,5.4361,0.9849,2.5084,4.2822,2.9165,3.1417,1.9132,2.6339,0.4592,0.1001,0.1874,3.9457,0.8773,2.3118,3.3835,2.3349,4.2079,5.5896,0.9762,2.4949,6.6595,6.2356,1.8828,3.8279,4.4393,0.872,3.5001,2.8777,5.582,3.3127,2.299,1.0495,3.5526,0.3416,5.7871,2.6057,1.6599,4.56,6.9022,3.6079,5.3887,4.1265,4.492,1.4432,6.4886,2.3743,1.012,0.6296,1.8334,8.5536,1.4416,2.6729,1.6281,0.872,0.1365,3.9058,0.9361,2.4875,1.0676,5.4112,0.0066,4.7715,0.0959,1.4172,3.2674,0.988,4.0961,4.2536,1.9596,1.232,3.7201,3.4387,2.5916,4.8301,1.9493,0.0026,6.8393,0.5935,2.1263,0.2063,2.4564,3.909,6.1228,3.0672,0.2663,2.7526,2.753,0.2744,4.812,1.6184,1.3126,0.6422,3.6417,1.4396,1.0194,0.0701,2.1983,3.2632,3.6703,1.1758,1.163,4.335,0.2751,2.8007,0.0485,0.0008,2.7242,2.1342,10.0065,2.0258,0.19,5.2431,1.0873,4.4506,2.9463,4.926,1.7927,1.1919,3.1472,3.7057,1.182,4.5376,7.7859,1.2924,2.6375,4.7477,1.8606,0.7568,0.7987,4.0811,1.524,3.8936,0.4866]}

Since the first option lasts longer than the second option, Funeral Directors have always done so, even though they are risking their lives to get richer. \nFuneral Directors have a tendency to make fun of anyone who works in any other profession.","token_len":184,"entropy":[9.1481,1.8999,6.9029,5.6982,0.275,8.0349,0.3557,6.7428,3.7919,2.894,4.8615,3.1682,6.163,0.5883,3.6272,14.0886,16.6081,5.0082,3.83,2.7449,2.6986,1.7089,9.5708,2.6259,0.4569,0.7661,4.4378,7.0784,6.6102,4.3403,0.5422,7.2712,6.8221,0.4258,0.7847,1.1151,2.3888,1.7924,10.8247,0.4922,3.8522,0.8763,10.9661,1.5469,3.7272,1.8521,3.6153,4.8016,1.8709,3.6041,2.9011,0.0129,5.1331,3.6569,3.0011,8.042,0.2034,1.7369,4.4645,0.3264,0.2433,0.003,0.0816,5.1141,5.6284,3.4104,2.6778,4.0314,2.4994,5.0621,6.358,2.531,3.281,2.1763,2.6294,0.132,5.0274,4.152,1.03,0.1557,1.1627,3.6076,6.5111,1.27,2.3705,0.0322,2.1356,2.1965,1.1087,2.2654,3.8895,6.4357,5.1946,4.8811,3.2739,2.0989,7.548,4.5371,8.3228,5.2897,2.0817,1.3951,1.0289,4.1236,2.2111,5.6079,8.1415,2.5378,5.7488,1.1664,1.6705,1.9543,2.0566,3.0809,5.2549,3.2497,6.3438,1.7381,0.3635,3.2545,3.8918,0.3948,0.7059,0.0072,0.194,6.9284,2.1748,3.8335,1.7185,8.2792,0.1467,4.2087,4.4369,6.0388,2.4672,5.4015,6.8487,7.4482,4.6313,1.047,1.1118,0.8058,2.1978,0.3522,5.8133,0.018,0.1822,3.2689,6.3399,4.273,4.0462,1.9955,2.8438,2.1521,1.1725,2.0761,9.2764,1.0214,1.3311,1.1093,2.7424,8.9279,0.9944,6.9778,4.2184,5.73,0.1434,0.1473,2.7496,2.1075,4.8845,0.1085,3.6643,4.2488,0.1091,3.9606,0.5044,4.097,2.1523,4.947,3.7308,0.4028,1.5081]}

What has been changed?\nThe necklace belongs to an Italian noblewoman and it bears the family crest; Arianna was able to recognise them in the photographs of the thieves.","token_len":191,"entropy":[9.1339,1.2769,4.731,3.683,5.4987,3.5742,0.2518,1.6464,4.2433,5.795,3.9061,5.6789,7.5745,5.9588,3.9638,2.0958,4.8984,6.1587,3.4526,2.5576,0.5933,3.7925,5.4109,4.4702,4.0195,5.4823,1.5566,3.0693,3.0156,7.4698,2.815,0.0048,10.0085,4.0346,4.8659,2.151,1.3796,4.442,2.8969,4.5754,3.6834,1.6121,1.8109,0.8516,0.9098,0.4388,6.1168,8.5875,0.3702,1.4265,1.3595,1.7791,5.1183,5.4902,5.5092,1.0774,0.817,7.0289,0.8821,5.5289,2.3924,4.0286,5.5102,1.9961,7.6455,4.609,4.8671,8.0698,2.0401,2.6488,1.6168,8.2351,1.1101,1.7111,2.3585,4.3103,5.5455,5.0278,0.6769,0.0042,0.0143,0.0221,0.403,1.858,2.632,1.3609,1.326,7.2779,0.0918,0.3198,0.902,0.3712,6.8412,1.9269,3.9559,3.6828,0.6498,0.4701,0.693,0.708,5.2277,1.8564,1.385,0.9566,0.1644,0.728,4.0123,1.6338,3.6231,4.0567,2.8999,0.0917,5.0685,0.5674,7.3027,1.2852,0.1269,4.4675,4.129,3.9754,2.1503,4.9984,3.2344,3.3071,1.7183,0.0367,7.9716,4.322,2.4497,0.4879,3.8773,2.3848,1.433,3.5651,2.1552,5.9454,3.4773,3.7628,3.4518,4.7372,5.6336,3.3606,0.2536,7.7179,0.0551,0.6193,0.841,1.4745,7.4367,5.9582,2.0219,4.7619,1.6322,7.0757,5.773,4.0248,3.6131,1.1913,1.1454,0.9602,1.0293,1.6792,4.3068,6.0241,0.042,3.4887,5.297,5.001,2.1219,3.6077,2.3581,6.4651,0.8896,5.7357,1.6906,5.0936,3.4333,0.0165,3.9887,3.239,0.0108,6.1187,5.7681,3.0506,1.1544,5.5473,2.1624,0.5951,3.4093,1.7024]}

{"prompt":"The first few successful artificial intelligences created have thinking patterns indicative of several mental illnesses","text":"The first few successful artificial intelligences created have thinking patterns indicative of several mental illnesses, such as mental retardation, a major mental disorder affecting the way a person's mind functions. A study of artificial consciousness in the novel Beyond Human Intelligence (2007) by Jonathan Weir and others examines both the ethical and philosophical implications of creating artificial intelligences. They suggest several ways they may affect humanity and the future, the primary among which they identify is the \"hyper-prediction\". This is the use of artificial intelligence systems that can predict the future, often in ways people are not aware and unable to control.\nThe concept of artificial intelligence being able to predict the future is also the subject of a scientific theory known as the Gaia Hypothesis. This theory proposes that an artificial intelligence system could be developed capable of predicting patterns in global climate change. One proponent of the theory states that it could mean a world in which all life has been rendered inoperative and humanity has vanished.","token_len":194,"entropy":[5.3423,5.1498,9.7194,9.2036,4.1785,0.0065,6.436,5.0844,13.2626,5.2668,8.4281,0.0141,7.6464,4.996,5.8511,1.291,1.8064,0.0036,4.8767,0.3652,0.0018,0.6458,4.6727,4.7503,2.144,0.7113,4.1595,2.6284,4.2706,4.4475,0.2302,3.4056,2.7399,2.4077,0.8438,3.9664,4.8032,1.4886,5.6064,5.5431,2.0508,2.1448,9.1568,8.904,4.1162,3.2255,2.303,5.32,0.3239,2.9999,5.7292,9.3201,0.7559,5.0616,7.0778,5.2889,1.1357,6.8453,0.6919,2.9813,1.158,0.1417,4.2374,0.9872,0.7084,0.0045,0.8266,3.0876,3.3162,7.0139,2.5759,6.0352,2.7082,4.5281,5.2807,2.467,1.7668,2.4011,2.2883,4.9444,6.4921,6.0516,0.4488,4.8074,5.154,4.5635,1.2938,3.6366,6.1315,1.2453,7.3014,2.3995,4.4333,3.5137,1.8371,1.9285,4.7636,0.0173,2.3368,0.3551,5.3738,1.6739,2.3157,0.667,1.6163,0.2756,1.8163,5.4181,2.3778,2.351,6.7581,3.09,1.1848,0.3788,5.6711,5.9814,0.0121,2.6818,0.4782,1.5072,7.7718,4.6651,0.1846,3.1518,0.3035,6.1943,2.6582,0.0083,0.4543,1.0621,0.0576,0.9777,3.197,4.3766,1.2148,0.0104,1.8025,6.2235,5.3626,2.6462,0.012,1.4381,9.0552,1.5711,0.0056,0.0001,0.8024,1.983,0.8296,2.2971,0.2354,3.9937,1.3311,0.3502,1.0411,2.3788,1.5567,4.9651,4.7464,0.003,1.1112,7.0076,1.7151,6.6588,1.9168,2.5275,1.7733,5.0312,8.7624,0.3393,0.7941,0.7601,3.1355,0.1939,2.9868,1.5129,6.8799,2.8547,2.576,1.5965,0.0599,4.0887,2.4246,3.8504,2.0084,6.7577,4.3346,3.1416,2.1078,4.1343,1.762,5.9903,0.751]}

How did these creatures survive for millions of years despite strong predation, freezing cold and a lack of oxygen?\nA number of theories have been proposed, but no clear conclusion has emerged yet, perhaps because the scientific community is divided on the issue: while some find the evidence convincing, others say it\u2019s only a small scale example of life.\nNevertheless, the discovery has been hailed as a new proof that life is not confined to Earth, and it represents a significant leap in our understanding of the universe.\nIn the 1980s, a team from the Institute of Ocean Sciences decided to study a group of oceanic crust called a \u2018 ridge\u2019.

I have used it for 10 years and every time I apply it it cleanses my teeth without pain.\nIf you like the idea of using real tea, you should try the Green Tea Enamel Cleanse. This is a great product for those who want to avoid the harsh artificial chemicals in toothpaste.\nA fantastic mouth care product that is gentle whilst still great. I can't fault anything about it. Would highly recommend.","token_len":197,"entropy":[7.217,0.0347,1.5809,11.8894,0.2302,9.7637,4.1963,2.0813,2.1805,3.5485,6.0674,2.933,1.3201,5.5933,2.8791,1.7218,5.6902,6.9696,3.6443,0.0015,9.2341,9.5049,1.1416,7.8882,1.3808,6.9871,5.4759,0.8151,0.4249,0.0291,2.5653,0.8301,5.7455,2.877,1.2643,2.1642,1.3068,3.2659,0.7429,3.9383,0.8926,1.6933,3.5612,1.0472,4.2647,0.9321,0.7318,1.6763,5.8917,0.2002,1.7185,2.1622,4.1497,4.6433,0.643,1.3606,8.2825,0.8871,2.9565,3.2088,2.2478,4.4323,2.0339,1.0983,3.8324,7.6517,6.9339,2.0394,2.733,0.5569,0.0112,8.3,2.2358,1.6985,2.3146,4.1138,5.0505,2.6225,6.9948,2.9002,1.459,1.421,2.3234,1.1412,4.7031,3.2256,6.1371,4.3886,5.5331,7.2736,4.2147,0.1573,1.3186,5.3769,4.1502,0.5093,4.4989,4.0989,4.0468,2.8564,0.9148,6.6559,4.3277,5.4227,2.0159,5.2179,0.2755,1.8392,0.6374,2.2218,2.5216,2.0838,0.8632,1.6441,4.6196,0.7151,0.8604,4.7587,0.3806,0.3719,5.2518,0.2616,2.6926,4.3011,2.9898,0.8766,0.6236,4.7825,6.5291,0.5857,1.597,4.1803,0.293,3.5356,2.2205,4.115,0.1471,1.768,7.4165,7.1653,1.6285,2.0975,1.8649,1.0085,3.183,6.6502,0.4828,6.3296,1.4936,8.7975,1.6398,1.4573,2.0201,1.5273,1.0156,2.5598,2.0922,2.2138,2.8637,0.7349,1.8696,0.499,2.9167,1.8216,4.0565,6.7131,5.6307,2.0914,3.7672,0.1319,0.3578,1.2308,4.4791,6.5675,5.4066,5.3649,0.5611,1.7996,2.0552,4.688,10.4694,3.2778,6.8056,3.2546,1.8346,3.8993,0.8287,6.7093,7.81,1.2618,1.669,0.638,6.9085,3.8911,0.0194,1.7648]}

Since then, the region between the North and South American continents was covered with glaciers that covered large parts of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, including parts of the North Pole.\nAsteroid destruction is still a long way off, but scientists do not lose hope that it is finally possible in the future.","token_len":198,"entropy":[10.872,6.0704,1.4857,1.7021,0.4004,0.6535,7.7505,0.4316,5.0655,1.6081,5.9641,8.6355,2.6323,7.6269,0.8476,6.2445,0.4704,3.7923,2.0975,2.1237,10.3518,2.0786,2.6159,2.9844,1.7282,6.7039,1.9212,1.8883,4.6266,0.9599,2.4798,3.4601,0.0006,5.6644,0.8643,2.7541,2.1643,4.5343,1.1066,2.7289,5.6072,7.9431,15.7383,8.0282,7.8652,3.7848,4.4854,4.3786,1.3108,7.9559,4.4306,2.1357,7.152,0.0182,3.0384,1.6288,4.0676,4.2616,5.7449,4.0904,5.3499,4.5566,1.9982,0.7481,2.7475,2.4437,3.3242,1.1097,1.1873,3.1332,5.8871,2.0981,0.8978,2.8495,6.3733,1.1004,3.9616,3.3825,0.6799,4.7661,3.3984,7.8919,0.1492,2.4257,1.0681,5.0522,1.3592,1.1007,1.642,1.4805,8.1056,1.9449,3.9817,0.8715,2.0327,4.3557,4.546,0.6823,0.1977,8.7776,5.5614,6.2886,0.0284,0.4617,9.7513,3.3888,1.3621,0.801,4.8514,0.0815,2.3057,2.7497,5.5122,7.616,1.95,1.6668,1.4216,5.2163,2.5804,0.4403,4.158,5.4602,6.0059,0.8642,2.0471,2.692,1.7388,5.4677,0.6531,4.2117,4.376,1.378,3.3048,1.397,0.0614,0.77,5.2421,0.4372,0.1954,1.9556,4.5684,6.3497,1.3545,2.593,1.8645,0.0777,3.1987,1.3996,5.0592,3.084,1.3275,5.9245,3.204,3.6761,4.2578,1.3502,0.0074,0.7847,3.6863,2.8134,4.8722,2.357,1.7199,3.5376,2.7876,0.0758,0.8842,3.0929,4.1531,0.5678,0.7575,3.0388,0.7592,0.975,4.9091,1.1174,4.862,1.5747,4.5333,0.4197,0.231,0.8054,0.7989,2.0823,5.2905,1.6798,8.9866,2.6611,1.683,1.7935,2.4608,5.4684,4.9135,5.116,0.6301,1.3349,0.3189]}
