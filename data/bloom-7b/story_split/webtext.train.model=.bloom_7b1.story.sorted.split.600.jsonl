{"prompt":"Many years from now , Mars is found to be the only planet with an atmosphere and absence of life .","text":"Many years from now, Mars is found to be the only planet with an atmosphere and absence of life. The discovery puts into question the survival of life on other worlds too.\nScientists have identified the planet Neptune as the outlier of the planets\u2019 chart. Neptune is thought to have lost its atmosphere long ago and the planet is today as cold and dark as a space body from another world. It is far from the sun and cold beyond even the cold of Pluto.\nAccording to a report by the Telegraph, space scientist Tim Brown has recently done a groundbreaking discovery based on the results of long observations of Uranus and Neptune.\nScientists had believed that Neptune and Uranus have no atmosphere and also no sun. But Brown has now proved this wrong. In fact Neptune is a gas giant and is in the Sun system rather closely.\nA mass of gas has gradually turned it into a solid. The gas has been kept around by gravity, which is why there is no significant pressure on it. Neptune is currently about a thousand times further away from the sun than the Earth. And it is also around 800 times bigger than the Earth.\nThe report stated that the discovery has helped scientists find out about the formation of the solar system itself.\nNeptune is a huge planet with an atmosphere that has been gradually transformed into a liquid. Like Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, Neptune is surrounded by cloud rings. This is because the gas has kept it hot. But the rings are less developed compared to Saturn\u2019s and Uranus. The ring from Neptune is more like a big bowl compared to Saturn\u2019s ring which forms a huge ring above it.\nThe mass of the gas keeps the moon from rotating on its axis like the gas does when all the planets are in orbit. It prevents the moon from rotating and keeping a fixed position. This causes the formation of the big and small moons.\nIn fact, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn have very active magnetic poles, which is probably because the gas keeps their moons away. While the moons of Earth have no active magnetic poles. While this could be because there is no gas and no gravity to keep them in a fixed position like there are for Jupiter and Saturn\u2019s moons.\nScientists have estimated that there are around 1,000 earth-like planets in the star systems of our galaxy. The discovery comes in an interesting time when scientists have been working on a mission to a sun like star which is far away from us and could offer them great insights.\nThe plan is to launch a rocket in the space near the star to investigate the surface conditions of the star. The observations will be done using cameras and telescopes. The results of the mission could be released soon.\nThe information from the observations will be invaluable not only for us, but for other future missions too. It will help us figure how our own planet\u2019s conditions have differed from ours and the planet we are living on today.","token_len":600,"entropy":[6.038,4.9761,0.0126,0.3681,9.0326,2.8167,8.8922,1.289,0.4627,2.9188,2.3009,2.365,2.1614,2.8976,1.2227,3.5305,10.9489,0.0044,2.2493,0.6806,2.4338,4.3978,6.7657,5.4673,1.4083,0.645,6.0571,0.0996,1.4408,0.7872,2.3123,1.5579,5.5403,0.5888,0.6341,17.4078,1.4599,4.1337,2.0852,3.4855,4.7527,1.3173,1.2159,9.2373,1.6065,2.5223,0.6903,3.7958,13.8498,6.7313,12.0063,4.6682,5.5159,0.7757,4.1149,0.0165,1.2393,5.4441,1.3131,0.8722,5.8649,0.2553,1.53,3.7734,2.1762,1.6234,7.9518,6.0433,1.9209,1.825,3.8628,0.049,3.4698,6.2617,6.5913,6.3698,5.6566,3.3242,0.4407,2.9837,0.8215,6.5172,0.9309,2.1788,6.3541,1.5888,5.3104,6.2958,4.7103,1.0451,4.833,5.6288,4.4251,0.8898,0.8356,5.6077,0.0039,2.6563,2.9129,1.8225,1.1249,8.5749,0.7348,7.2801,4.1737,5.3817,5.7416,3.1279,5.1051,5.7619,0.8967,6.6142,3.02,5.5146,0.0652,1.5909,4.0019,0.0873,6.7031,6.752,0.7602,5.9916,0.0978,1.239,0.2892,0.6895,1.1747,4.584,4.4876,5.1195,0.6366,1.9532,2.7522,0.8506,0.0012,4.8385,3.0148,0.5745,1.4258,6.7318,3.1786,3.7719,0.6123,1.7773,2.0003,2.6484,1.1218,3.0329,2.7208,3.2726,0.8639,2.9587,1.6388,5.7246,1.4278,3.0515,4.5707,0.3849,1.603,2.436,3.7941,1.4814,5.3237,5.5359,4.7055,7.5429,0.9413,0.9975,4.229,6.8368,0.4117,5.3232,3.4948,7.6183,5.3738,4.7046,0.2197,0.4702,3.6204,2.1345,2.0933,2.3456,2.1978,2.0799,6.0649,4.6477,1.7497,2.6185,2.3953,2.125,1.7517,2.6946,3.5844,0.5756,0.9165,6.1312,4.1797,1.453,1.5245,0.3616,5.1276,0.864,4.6643,2.8246,4.1985,2.7316,0.2336,6.1977,0.5277,0.7986,0.2448,1.5042,0.3393,2.073,3.0474,0.7358,4.8496,2.0074,0.6822,3.4095,4.3358,7.4519,0.9131,4.431,0.2142,0.9367,1.7696,0.4427,0.4747,2.2079,5.8276,5.6727,0.4949,1.4439,3.5654,3.3652,3.8898,1.8463,3.5608,2.3416,2.7677,0.8704,4.5681,0.1195,1.2515,2.3971,0.0822,5.1287,0.5039,0.946,4.5749,0.0004,0.0075,1.0393,2.3186,4.4547,1.8215,1.6571,2.1624,0.5387,2.1514,2.626,1.6017,6.793,5.2164,0.3856,0.5905,2.3589,1.1576,5.6357,3.5553,0.553,3.3909,0.8923,0.6073,0.0026,0.3217,0.7909,0.8346,3.3027,0.0536,7.2715,5.589,1.2777,2.794,2.1605,2.7351,1.2025,3.458,2.6494,5.1542,2.051,6.1617,2.6584,3.5401,1.7735,5.1084,1.3085,5.1945,5.9638,4.8797,0.0933,3.9317,7.9675,1.0727,8.8246,3.7232,0.4396,0.012,1.0634,2.3997,3.3545,6.3581,0.7859,0.8933,3.7991,1.5385,0.5055,5.091,5.4938,4.8922,0.044,2.2518,1.7635,0.0212,0.0819,4.8853,3.7667,6.0201,2.7128,4.2784,4.4295,5.7975,2.1776,0.2565,0.6378,1.6323,5.0812,0.1257,0.8784,1.0185,5.6686,1.4179,5.1916,1.8116,4.7603,3.9785,0.3915,0.194,4.6452,2.371,6.1333,1.1399,3.123,6.301,0.7981,2.0143,0.7693,1.3946,2.5929,2.3962,2.6238,6.5831,0.8721,0.6373,0.0913,1.956,3.1994,4.7459,4.077,5.9587,2.0211,1.4058,2.5921,4.1474,0.6495,5.9392,0.016,1.4716,5.5782,5.1677,1.6428,2.6798,1.1416,0.7168,3.2654,2.0267,0.5581,1.2322,3.0774,1.1006,2.2748,0.3099,0.047,2.0046,3.3411,6.9693,4.1971,3.6468,2.3803,0.942,3.1385,6.4627,3.7618,1.2972,3.8637,2.8397,3.7013,5.6196,5.8114,2.9539,6.1241,1.2385,2.0768,0.7654,3.831,2.5966,3.6421,1.9375,0.2418,0.0681,5.2919,6.3366,4.5259,3.7376,1.2413,1.4674,3.1868,0.408,0.7887,3.4737,4.3203,2.0264,6.0818,2.2653,0.6979,0.7264,2.0559,2.7952,2.7783,0.4649,5.2664,5.9612,1.9439,4.0628,2.7151,0.4201,0.0331,5.0866,0.0239,0.0332,0.5692,1.7432,0.4414,3.5222,1.1304,5.4531,0.1985,2.5195,0.6717,2.456,2.9041,1.3836,0.7958,7.4337,1.1951,1.1525,0.8084,1.4384,0.2789,7.3184,3.9354,0.7049,2.3565,2.7983,0.5203,2.338,4.5987,4.9058,3.3232,3.7677,2.4042,3.942,3.1277,3.097,1.8487,1.3497,2.636,0.6716,2.8064,4.4251,0.3538,5.7856,6.1979,5.6681,3.4393,4.6103,1.3162,4.3963,1.1668,0.3019,2.4427,2.2738,3.2463,6.0698,4.4406,5.5284,2.4184,1.8331,0.6126,2.0139,6.2797,0.6218,0.3203,4.0263,0.9302,4.7606,3.2623,1.8882,5.7167,5.5497,1.2534,3.0965,2.5085,3.8333,0.8618,4.9992,3.3645,0.7887,0.6483,1.4805,0.9602,1.5969,7.4952,1.2975,1.7264,3.4802,2.4476,5.8692,1.3105,3.4526,1.4307,1.6767,4.3946,1.5294,0.7734,2.7053,2.555,0.9861,4.0222,2.2816,0.6044,0.7142,1.6001,6.1207,2.2409,0.5869,3.1106,1.142,0.9397,6.1299,6.5988,0.0666,0.8702,4.7817,1.3234,0.0607,0.5786,2.2104,4.6141,1.2293,5.5676,0.1702,3.191,1.0569,1.5944,0.8059,4.9988,7.0184,3.4455,2.6054,1.8662,12.1058,0.0737,0.8831,5.6329,4.1362,8.4023,0.7732,1.7361,2.0462,3.3975,3.3604,2.6196,1.2258,2.7194,0.5493,3.9528,0.2288]}

established by the United Galactic Empires, and are now one of the wealthiest individuals in the universe.Your fortune is so large that you own a fleet of luxury yachts which you use to visit your planet every year.When you decided that the new galactic star system below your home galaxy might be an excellent place to settle you purchased many solar systems with thousands of luxurious planets each as holiday spots for you and some of the most famous celebrities of your planet.\nNow you know so much about your new world that you had hired a lot of scientists and engineers to help you to learn about the different types of plants and animals and human beings.Once in a while you visited the planet you bought when you were a child there and you enjoyed swimming and doing some of the activities you had done on your planet.\nWhile your yachtsmen are cleaning the yachts you play with your favorite video games in your luxurious quarters to relax after a long day of work or while you are waiting for new orders.\nYou have a huge and complex system that controls the weather and all the natural elements in your planets and it also controls many of the activities of your population, such as food production all the shopping for your luxurious stores, the manufacturing, construction and other areas of your economy.\nYou have a very important task as you are the wealthiest person in

{"prompt":"The most unspeakable act has been committed . Someone has downloaded a car .","text":"The most unspeakable act has been committed. Someone has downloaded a car. It was the car of his own brother. Now, he has been arrested. The police have arrested him, but they are not able to know why he is guilty.\n2. He has not been able to meet the court, nor his family. They are not able to get in touch with his lawyer. He is in jail and his phone has been checked, but no contact.\n3. Another case similar to this one is that of a family who has been arrested. Their cars have been taken, but they are not given details. One of the family members lost his job. As far as the police, it is not clear why they were arrested.\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop people from going to the mall. Not just because they love it. But because they are scared of the crime and its impact on their family.\nI see more and more people wearing masks. I see them talking on their phones, talking to people online, doing business. I see more and more people wearing the same T-shirts.\nEven in the streets, people are more cautious, so afraid that someone will have the virus. If someone is wearing a mask, it is because he has been infected.\nI don\u2019t know how they are dealing with the media, but there have been more videos, but there is no information in it.\nThere are many more people who are afraid to tell their stories. Many people are afraid of what it will mean to their family and to those who are dear to them.\nWe are on the right path. We have taken all the measures to control the virus. Our medical staff, who are in the frontline, are working to save our lives.\nIt is not easy and not easy. Every day brings new challenges, new problems. I feel myself weakened by all these struggles.\nI am tired. I am a mother of a young girl. I cannot be selfish and I must look out for her. I always look out for her.\nThe first thing I do in the morning is prepare the snacks she eats. I try to put a little love in what I prepare, but it is not enough. I put in all my efforts but it doesn\u2019t stop the feeling of disappointment inside me.\nI get tired when I try to understand all the difficulties. I don\u2019t know who is responsible for what in this chaos.\nOne of my neighbors was an architect. Everything is fine. He took care of his son and his wife.

{"prompt":"You 're an astronaut in an international team ( of an extraterrestrial species ) . While on a mission on one of your moons , you are visited by Earth astronauts .","text":"You're an astronaut in an international team ( of an extraterrestrial species ). While on a mission on one of your moons, you are visited by Earth astronauts. They offer to take you back to Earth but the space shuttle requires some time to come back. At the same time though, alien ships have arrived, searching for something specific. Would you give them your help to complete their mission while waiting for them? Or would you be willing to save the mission, even the help is of a foreign kind, to return to life like conditions back on Earth for longer, knowing that in exchange the aliens would kill you? \nThis may sound silly, but this is what I want to ask : Is killing people of a different species an acceptable thing under certain conditions? Why? What could be the purpose of it?\nAlso, if killing a friendly species was an acceptable thing, would it also be the same for a species that attacked your family or your planet? Would you be willing to kill such people, even if they are not friendly, knowing that you have no chance of revenge?\n\nA:\n\nIt would be a bit easier to decide if you were an AI that would have to decide on an ethical action, not the human, but we can do a fair approximation since humans never consider killing an alien as an acceptable value.\nI tend to be more inclined towards not killing aliens. If it is true, as you say, that there is a value to killing these aliens, then it might be an ethical dilemma to me as well. We humans tend to not see the world the aliens see, and they might have a very different concept of death from us. This could lead to issues with how you justify killing them. \nBut what this case isn't is a simple matter where humans just find it wrong to kill an alien. Instead there is a value that you can assign to the humans and aliens, and a value that you can assign to what the aliens and humans can gain. You are trying to find a value that is common to both groups, but you have to take the perspective of the aliens into account.\nYou can assign the aliens a value of a planet to be saved for a while. They might view this as an attack on their homeworld as well. You can put a value on humans, humans being a valuable species. You can also try to figure out what the aliens and humans have in common - i.e. they are both living beings with a morality system that can affect them, and this morality system is just as likely to affect the aliens as it is to affect the human. This might be enough for your moral system, but if not you can go on and try to find something else. \nYou can say that there is a value in a higher value that can be gained by all the humans you kill in your act of mercy. You can ask why you should not kill an alien to gain that higher value.","token_len":600,"entropy":[5.2846,4.5686,5.8613,3.896,3.7856,3.4404,3.8477,6.2243,10.1836,5.6893,5.4105,0.0152,2.2488,4.8081,6.5584,4.2874,1.6043,0.4003,4.6721,5.2355,0.447,2.82,5.8842,0.7133,0.5677,2.9106,5.4544,0.1337,7.1187,5.1198,1.5491,2.506,4.8116,2.8133,2.5453,0.22,2.5569,0.2812,1.3864,5.0812,4.0069,4.7881,2.4287,6.6184,4.5677,2.7833,0.7461,4.1887,0.6825,1.3662,5.0447,1.162,2.312,0.0274,6.721,0.3385,8.3636,5.1663,2.9949,2.7038,2.8535,6.1351,0.3092,5.9852,6.3963,1.4283,6.8626,0.1679,5.1866,0.8761,1.667,3.7585,2.7686,5.6264,1.3803,0.2784,6.0967,5.3621,0.4207,1.522,1.3728,3.3712,0.6929,0.1047,3.3895,1.544,0.0222,4.9272,1.8498,4.8727,3.5536,3.9306,5.7566,7.9174,7.5911,5.0562,2.4037,5.9703,3.3113,2.8537,2.8767,4.4997,1.1154,5.7573,5.8761,11.0468,6.0283,1.1217,0.2217,5.4757,7.7356,3.6465,6.3785,0.613,4.5902,4.7039,3.8948,2.121,2.4504,5.8291,0.4956,1.5257,7.0834,4.6877,4.3429,5.3106,1.2425,4.1648,0.9293,0.1952,3.8829,0.8684,2.0524,2.8999,3.9103,0.7917,4.072,6.7764,4.3748,8.0051,3.5795,4.3359,2.8106,2.108,0.7622,2.9307,1.9606,3.3071,7.0848,2.6254,1.5477,0.8143,4.8241,4.1263,3.2389,5.4597,1.308,1.7258,2.7463,0.2265,4.4683,0.6574,2.0203,6.2987,0.5759,2.7906,5.1462,2.6392,6.5857,2.9062,3.549,2.261,0.262,0.7383,1.2691,2.1772,1.2101,2.519,0.4178,3.9701,2.105,1.3136,2.9223,3.8258,0.9816,5.5259,3.1716,4.5489,1.8042,3.2496,2.8707,0.7208,3.4095,1.4216,1.8767,0.6139,0.0243,2.727,5.0949,3.4981,2.5658,1.3294,0.4384,1.5037,2.1099,2.2796,3.3304,2.4525,3.8784,0.2393,2.0493,3.0816,2.3119,2.9998,0.5686,6.8059,0.9674,1.2086,7.7264,4.4505,3.5242,3.2128,0.0099,3.4708,2.6913,0.5115,2.4509,4.1813,4.2093,0.5184,5.4159,2.0882,1.8442,3.5068,3.2525,7.9276,4.491,2.6271,3.902,1.6247,5.1342,3.1696,3.7736,3.2476,5.1083,1.9618,4.7812,3.6832,4.8545,3.446,2.8221,5.0253,2.128,3.6546,2.9481,5.4249,4.5975,6.5667,3.6346,6.1067,5.7553,2.8367,3.0036,1.8993,2.4753,0.8244,0.9462,7.6853,0.7895,1.2275,11.5044,7.5031,0.0543,3.5577,1.7182,4.4281,1.6109,5.2736,1.3787,3.3505,2.2754,2.989,2.9687,1.5404,5.2684,2.604,5.5094,3.662,1.8861,0.258,0.4838,3.1623,0.8651,1.1922,5.1122,0.9302,0.9361,5.8781,1.9626,0.5315,0.8049,1.6466,3.5945,0.5832,3.7553,1.6412,5.8912,2.2916,6.3204,3.2177,1.5786,0.355,5.468,3.1944,4.417,0.0975,3.8186,4.3608,1.9023,3.7177,3.5745,8.5344,1.6871,1.509,1.4162,4.291,3.5222,3.5995,1.7998,3.6012,1.2706,5.8834,0.1172,6.7283,2.7278,1.1973,0.6586,3.9704,3.1248,3.2567,0.4227,4.9414,1.9214,3.5225,4.0432,4.9973,1.0337,2.5483,1.1427,5.08,0.2778,9.4748,3.6759,6.0984,6.4801,5.6861,0.0003,2.2325,1.7957,4.1755,2.5631,6.762,3.5567,5.7042,5.5371,1.9133,4.97,0.4788,0.6745,1.9324,0.2761,1.0161,4.9256,4.1191,1.0524,0.6294,5.8247,2.606,3.0066,1.7504,5.0124,0.2419,2.1408,5.138,2.4861,6.6714,2.0523,1.4733,4.0638,1.4216,0.366,1.0592,0.4217,1.4935,0.1109,6.0586,2.6724,1.4391,5.2535,0.3571,3.8252,7.4477,2.0371,4.2059,3.3938,4.2751,0.0147,3.2508,1.1336,1.7227,0.9036,1.5214,6.7767,0.781,1.5625,2.898,1.151,2.3482,2.6049,2.6498,1.1696,4.1597,2.6462,6.3372,1.1433,1.6705,2.7732,7.0565,0.2456,0.7957,1.2644,8.0316,1.8917,3.402,2.5109,3.5596,1.8061,0.5628,2.1866,3.0841,7.3401,2.8136,3.0159,5.0225,3.1711,2.3104,4.0745,2.016,3.2211,2.1702,7.4607,1.624,0.1904,1.8841,6.5872,0.5773,1.5199,3.462,0.0042,4.9757,1.1542,1.354,2.4164,1.2714,5.2133,2.2695,1.1502,0.9177,5.3187,2.1025,4.8021,4.9973,2.6125,5.3102,0.9917,2.1108,1.7057,0.5519,3.0147,5.1949,0.3007,5.4811,0.0506,1.3103,1.8107,0.9852,3.2128,0.1058,2.9293,0.4096,0.0037,5.5621,6.9947,0.0028,0.0004,0.3787,3.1856,1.2556,2.0683,5.0991,2.3399,2.7617,1.631,7.7727,3.8856,1.2428,4.0088,5.0492,1.749,2.4393,1.2262,4.6783,4.7501,0.2769,1.4514,4.8244,2.7073,3.5154,0.0957,2.6857,1.938,0.6836,0.751,1.9013,1.1561,0.7558,3.0035,1.0075,3.8173,0.4767,3.1403,3.6976,1.1941,5.1522,1.7644,4.0296,4.5505,1.8448,2.5859,0.4832,2.7565,4.2013,2.6477,2.0015,4.3311,2.0399,1.897,3.2421,0.3389,1.9012,2.5507,2.2123,1.633,2.9355,0.1237,5.5804,0.9041,4.6886,0.7369,3.3092,0.3445,0.7017,0.8938,2.535,3.7498,6.6143,1.3869,2.5071,3.7609,0.5251,3.1752,1.343,5.6871,2.5768,2.254,4.1907,2.4263,4.0061,2.4702,7.9993,1.5164,6.0507,0.7136,2.4864,0.7439,4.297,3.5364,2.0232,3.2642,2.8589,1.1489,2.3525,0.1778,4.0364,2.1157,2.0682,1.4962,0.1505,0.7465]}

You are the next victim. You can only save your life if you can find the killer.\nSonic Forces is a very interesting new project by SEGA, in which it will put in practice the first episode of a new story based in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, this one made public by the company over the weekend during the gaming press conference at the E3 2015.\nIn the game we will see the return of the four heroes who first came into sight in the Sonic the Hedgehog games for the SEGA Genesis game console, which were made famous by the series of the Sonic the Hedgehog.\nIn the new edition of the franchise it will also be possible to play as a new character, called Tails, an amnesiac hedgehog who has come from the future to stop the murderer named Eggman from reaching his goal, which will involve the return of the Shadow the Hedgehog.\nTails was seen for the first time in Sonic 2D in 1995, later in Sonic Adventure 2 in 2001 and finally in Sonic Generations in 2013, where he had appeared as an enemy, but it would be the first role that could have a very important moment in the new adventure.\nIn fact, in the first chapter of the game, which gives the title to the game, we will see the heroes take on the role of the Tails of the game, a role with the powers that would make it appear again in the future in the adventure.\nSonic Forces is a new project that SEGA has confirmed in the gaming press conference of the E3 2015, as well as the existence of the first chapter, which will be called The Fateful Trilogy.\nThe second chapter will be called The Return, while in the third we will see the title of The Fates Collide. All of them will be made available for free to those who have made the digital version of the title.\nOne thing that has been confirmed is the fact that it will appear in English the narration in a foreign language when the player finishes the first chapter, so it can fully take advantage of all the explanations that the game shows the player about what is happening when they reach certain areas.\nSurgical and non-surgical options for the treatment of obesity, including bariatric surgery at Inova Fairfax.\nDr. Michael Levin, board-certified in both internal medicine and general surgery practices in Inova Fairfax.

In, when the U.S. breaks into a modern day civil war, Tell the story from a unique perspective. In, when the world is full of war and chaos, one man is caught in the crossfire, and he comes to terms with the fact that he is. I love these books and I don't know where you're.\nThe book is about a man who has just turned nineteen, who, as it turns out, is a wartime teenage soldier. While the book was written in, he deals with his experiences.\nFrom The Books of the Bible: Proverbs In, during the time of the Civil War, a 19-year-old soldier from Virginia is ordered to lead a. But the war is far from over. As the conflict rages on, the man who was once an idalistic outlaw, becomes a soldier.\nIn the winter of, he is ordered to a town in Alabama where he is separated from the rest of the regiment and sent alone to kill Confederates.\nAt just nineteen years old, and living in Virginia, Tom has always been on the side of law and order. But when he's ordered to carry out the final stages of the war and to fight the Confederates, he suddenly has to confront the horrors that lead up to violence and death.\nAs war breaks out, and he and the rest of the soldiers are sent from the Army to carry out the last stages of fighting, the old Tom goes through a complete transformation. He becomes determined to follow orders and kill, and he starts to wonder if it's possible to be good at crime and kill.\nThe book begins in when the Civil War rages on and the main character is only nineteen years old. As he has always been a law-abiding young man, all of this comes as a shock.\nHis father is also a heroic man in the local military service and while he is only nineteen, he has gone into service in the local army and served in Virginia. When the war breaks out, there are a number of local men who have been drafted to fight.\nTom is not one of these people although he has been drafted himself. He is the son of a man who is in the army and due to this, he is the youngest soldier in the town.\nIt is not until the end of the war when he has to kill that he gets to experience the horrors of war, although he only does so from a distance.

Everything seems fine to you, taxes are paid, the plants are watered. Until one day a strange man appeared at your house and said, '' Just like 3 months ago, lets do this ''. You are on vacation when the phone rings, you go to your bed with the intention of resting, everything is quiet. You hear what they say, your wife is worried about you. The strange man says that he heard a noise, a dog barking, the same bark as 3 months ago and the woman says '' We will talk when we return, take the children to play outside''. The next day the strange man leaves you alone but says '' Come and visit the others, one of them wants to take over the whole world''. All of a sudden the phone rings, you know someone is at the door but don't hear anything. A second later you know someone is watching you. Your heart is freezing and you can feel something wrong. You go back into your room, there are still people outside. One of them climbs onto the roof of your car and they set off. You wake up in the hospital with broken bones and in coma. You remember nothing. Your head hurts and you know that you are there for a long time. There are flowers everywhere and it smells good. You ask the nurse to check you. She says, \"\" You are in a coma, you are here because of a car accident ''. You are at the house in a coma, you are not going anywhere, the children keep asking why, are you not going home, you are stuck here. The car driver who said, that there is a stranger at your house is still waiting outside, now he doesn't say anything he simply stands next to the car. He asks, `` Why are you here, is there something going on ''. It was you 3 months ago who said to him, we have to talk. He does not know what you mean, he doesn't know that you were in the hospital. He says '' Do me a favor, bring a chair outside so we can talk ''. You open your eyes you say '' No'' and they put you back in a coma. At first you aren't sure, but in a moment you can see that the sun is there and it's shining. A voice calls `` I know you are awake, listen, the first time you saw me it was the same way, the day I met you, even now I get the same feeling, same sun, same flowers.

{"prompt":"A woman meets a guy that she really likes . The guy finally brings her home to meet his parents . The woman has a secret past life as a prostitute and recognizes the guy 's father as one of her former clients .","text":"A woman meets a guy that she really likes. The guy finally brings her home to meet his parents. The woman has a secret past life as a prostitute and recognizes the guy's father as one of her former clients. They begin to get to know each other, though the girl knows more than he does about her past life. After a while they become lovers and begin getting involved in dangerous drug dealing.\nThe ending is not all that clear. Who decides which truth is the real one?\nA couple of times I'm seeing in my spirit guide that one of a couple of the main male characters is really the reincarnation of a very powerful spirit, that appears to be a demon. They have been working with each other on some kind of spiritual project ; they are also trying to keep some people from causing harm to others.\nOne of the side characters is an ancient spirit that has been locked in a tower and that appears to be a spirit that had been reincarnating with no real knowledge of who he \/ she was. He has been working with a bunch of monsters to defeat the demon that appears to be the main protagonist of the movie, so the whole thing would all look like some kind of twisted revenge movie.\nWhen the main protagonist finally realizes who he really is during the middle of the scene where he confronts the spirit that is reincarnating with no memory of her past life, the spirit seems shocked and says he couldn't tell. In general the scene looks like it's all a dream, and that when the movie ends one of the main characters who was never really a part of it, is getting a real wake up call. Maybe the real one is just a reincarnation, while the real other one just has no memory of her past life and is working with evil spirits and monsters.\nThe ending shows the main character as he heads to jail to face some crimes that he believes he committed, apparently he is an innocent person. The last scene doesn't look that clear like it starts with him meeting some spirits that lead him to believe he's actually guilty of the crimes he says he is innocent of. The last scene starts with him looking at the wall and realizing that he really did committed those crimes...\nI can't remember what happens in the very last scenes, or if I remember them.\nIs this really a movie? Or does this appear in some form every once and a while like in movies or dreams as part of the person's psychic activity? How can that be explained?\nIf he believes he is guilty, that proves that he is trying to do his justice. So what we have here is a hero trying to perform the laws of justice and he meets some spirits of vengeance so he can help them achieve this goal. This would be a movie that would be rated very well, I bet.\nI just don't know if this is really a movie or if it's something we all have sometimes but doesn't appear in the public view in the way a movie does.","token_len":606,"entropy":[8.2673,9.1148,0.9968,4.3921,4.7498,1.7372,4.5825,1.1171,1.2366,2.9276,1.2378,6.8834,5.8435,0.5397,2.3232,2.714,4.0527,2.8773,4.1367,0.6556,2.1476,2.7865,3.3984,1.6018,5.2049,6.7891,8.5305,3.7904,0.4592,2.4084,1.3997,9.3891,1.7415,2.323,1.9292,3.3405,1.6757,3.9197,0.2587,1.1258,5.1405,3.4395,0.1797,3.9499,3.9698,1.1455,2.5916,3.1863,0.0093,0.0466,0.0129,1.7222,4.2374,2.5816,3.8364,5.2746,3.0646,2.4529,3.3725,0.6466,1.8865,1.2195,1.1905,1.1115,0.4244,3.9276,1.9647,2.4531,3.0111,2.7815,3.8306,1.0362,3.3314,5.2633,4.0326,0.7154,7.3735,5.5624,0.7032,0.5948,2.192,6.5749,4.5023,1.6301,3.9296,3.8693,1.5667,5.2231,1.7834,7.5612,4.3125,3.0171,8.7712,1.2432,2.9082,2.8801,2.6911,0.5441,2.3116,3.907,3.6083,1.0772,4.908,2.5548,4.2001,5.5217,6.8253,1.857,12.0242,5.9889,1.7607,4.5899,0.8768,6.2781,1.5503,0.636,4.0661,3.3725,7.582,0.21,1.3158,3.8816,2.4033,7.5031,0.7189,0.2326,1.7121,5.3162,2.8362,5.0234,2.4221,3.8028,6.47,1.0985,0.5354,2.077,4.113,1.5939,4.5583,3.1113,2.608,4.5661,3.3738,2.9724,0.0104,2.6729,2.6816,2.121,0.0087,4.0231,3.2391,12.1685,2.7333,2.2485,3.9751,2.3596,0.045,4.9354,4.2519,4.9378,1.9485,7.0424,2.6493,0.6468,2.0445,0.6078,2.0214,3.7642,0.6848,0.2681,5.3359,0.7496,1.0815,3.4119,4.3401,2.9589,1.9164,2.441,1.1278,6.1331,1.2975,0.4542,4.6521,2.7642,3.1247,4.0559,0.1496,0.3589,1.7165,3.9462,1.9265,4.0087,1.1537,3.4013,4.722,4.5503,4.4568,3.3608,4.1807,0.4627,2.7009,1.7504,10.5265,0.363,0.6102,0.6542,2.3215,2.5337,1.2654,4.0584,1.096,2.8326,3.994,0.0037,5.7743,2.2008,4.4886,1.5701,2.6691,3.1108,4.3972,0.3436,0.1434,1.3896,5.8362,3.3354,1.4225,0.521,2.8235,1.7054,3.279,2.8279,4.4319,1.3429,4.7349,6.4969,4.1299,1.8306,3.9079,0.9612,0.0034,4.8256,5.377,2.9161,0.5947,0.9368,4.7245,1.2557,2.7932,1.4592,3.3049,3.6045,1.5445,0.8484,2.4275,0.0956,7.4015,0.6625,5.4881,0.3172,0.3684,5.7832,3.4656,0.8143,4.6112,0.4611,4.2617,2.7393,2.1348,3.763,0.0906,1.0113,0.6514,3.9149,0.1869,5.2583,2.0277,0.1633,0.4119,1.9283,4.0567,4.2977,7.1816,1.0917,3.1755,3.3397,5.9161,0.001,3.783,3.538,4.2832,6.6353,2.497,4.0969,3.2528,1.2403,2.2959,1.481,4.0349,1.7258,3.137,1.6234,2.2222,3.2132,6.3038,1.1068,2.3624,1.383,6.3981,1.1334,0.0836,0.4776,0.3171,5.4047,2.0457,5.0036,2.6022,2.2811,1.8815,0.002,1.8741,2.895,1.9522,5.8267,2.8659,4.1659,7.8303,0.284,0.0265,0.7047,5.2027,2.068,3.5767,2.7685,1.1382,3.5128,1.6391,4.1708,0.4412,3.4956,5.9863,0.4951,1.7157,9.2495,1.6297,4.5616,2.4803,3.7216,0.8058,0.2839,1.1916,0.1373,0.0935,2.7743,1.5013,4.9029,1.1444,4.7513,1.537,3.3557,3.0491,1.2047,0.7124,1.9305,2.2513,5.4635,1.8059,1.5962,1.1175,4.0827,3.8169,7.8043,1.4477,5.9081,2.1844,2.3003,3.382,5.9262,1.9723,1.1968,4.1828,2.1632,3.0575,2.2319,7.5239,2.4818,2.1731,4.5025,3.0364,1.6856,1.3477,2.0688,5.3263,1.8399,5.5933,0.0004,4.7213,3.4816,5.4387,6.0077,1.6422,7.2759,1.1786,1.4684,5.3954,2.7863,6.2956,1.6775,6.9435,0.5795,0.3076,1.8149,0.85,2.1328,3.4367,5.917,1.4228,2.9749,0.6386,0.9968,6.1412,0.2375,4.379,3.2776,0.2119,0.5438,2.3246,3.2823,0.6842,4.5448,0.9352,0.7839,4.4682,0.8509,1.5556,4.6842,1.4564,3.0098,1.1816,1.0021,4.0955,2.6898,6.6127,3.0739,0.2039,5.8849,1.2786,2.8528,3.5105,0.4562,3.2061,2.0889,3.711,2.5433,0.8225,6.5316,0.8339,4.7234,1.5457,4.4255,2.5476,1.9761,2.6236,3.8806,1.4704,1.4693,5.9494,1.7119,3.3868,1.6072,2.9041,2.1434,3.137,2.6926,1.5666,7.4681,2.6767,2.4056,3.7602,7.3955,3.8785,3.5023,0.132,0.0166,5.0827,2.6386,5.053,2.6574,9.6051,5.9116,4.9899,0.003,1.6374,8.4635,1.3434,6.402,5.5562,0.404,5.3752,3.0343,4.5838,0.8691,5.8471,1.0324,0.9336,4.1135,5.2629,6.0121,0.7771,1.646,2.2,1.4253,3.5308,6.7233,1.4454,0.2993,0.8716,4.7888,0.0312,3.4587,4.1683,6.5302,1.1841,4.656,3.0711,4.519,1.8424,0.5298,0.185,0.9878,6.4411,2.6088,0.0396,8.0823,2.9041,5.9574,0.2632,1.2459,2.2225,4.1253,5.2361,1.154,2.5822,4.1363,5.0619,5.1622,1.1108,0.6817,4.5359,1.7332,5.2372,3.3914,0.7509,0.3052,3.3617,4.5063,1.2949,1.5128,3.1195,1.4962,2.1068,1.7649,7.3931,5.0931,2.7743,1.8481,3.8078,5.7619,1.5535,0.9307,2.3089,4.5705,1.9842,0.0027,1.4947,1.7321,1.1839,0.9157,2.4148,0.9205,0.6003,1.4115,1.7192,0.6043,0.9197,3.8029,4.0031,3.9675,2.482,9.9942,4.8699,8.265,0.0003,3.9332,0.6099,2.2608,6.3058,3.3311,3.7009,1.6314,3.7469,4.3961,0.5869,3.4201,0.3681]}
{"prompt":"In a parallel universe , Native Americans advanced more quickly than Europeans . Native American explorers have just now arrived at The New World : Great Britain .","text":"In a parallel universe, Native Americans advanced more quickly than Europeans. Native American explorers have just now arrived at The New World : Great Britain. They have already conquered them and built a civilization that is comparable to the great Western civilization.\nThere are only three countries left on earth : India, China, and Russia. Their economy (GDP per capita) are comparable, but China has a much better political system.\nIn that parallel world, the population of Japan is reduced to about 500,000. The population of China, which is not the case in the real world, is in reality an empire, and the Japanese are actually living like colonized and invaded peoples (Chinese are the colonizers, Japanese the colonized).\nJapan has become a state-of-the-art democracy with an extremely good human rights track record. The Japanese have succeeded in integrating in the modern market economy (they have achieved the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d), but they are also proud of their culture, which is not inferior in any way to that of the major Western countries.\nJapan\u2019s culture is characterized by its unique sense of history, a combination of the Western spirit of scientific progress with the Eastern spirit of mysticism.\nJapanese culture is much influenced by Chinese culture, as they also share similar philosophies and religion.\nThe modern Japanese, who have adopted and adapted so many things from the Western civilization, have been so successful that they have made a living by copying Western cultures.\nIn reality, these parallels cannot be taken seriously. All the same, they tend to be so attractive to some people because they fit so smoothly into their mental pictures of the world. There is a trend to make them true, however, as in the following example, the difference between the two worlds is completely blurred.\nIn the following excerpt, it is suggested that people in the West (and in Japan as well) are not only a bit silly, but also immature, and that the reason is that they lack the sense of history, which is very important in the modern world of knowledge and technology.\nSome Chinese Americans complain about the low standards of ethics and decency of the people in America.\nIn response to this remark, it is suggested that Americans are not so much \u201cshrinking\u201d on ethical and moral issues as they just miss the sense of history ; for most Americans don\u2019t know the real history of the past, except that their ancestors were in the West and became American.\nOn the other hand, there should be a high level of politeness in society, but many Americans actually seem to be proud of being stingy to such an extent that they are ashamed about asking for a discount or a free gift ; they just don\u2019t know how to say please or thank you.\nMost people in America are proud of their freedom and have a \u201cfree will\u201d attitude towards their work ; that is, they think it is their right to make their own decisions in whatever circumstances.","token_len":608,"entropy":[3.4603,7.7459,2.8669,0.4861,9.9738,0.7141,9.4548,5.3845,2.4317,0.5456,2.6634,1.4385,3.0714,2.4845,5.3097,4.6971,7.6274,5.3003,3.2513,1.855,7.3439,4.1647,0.6909,8.4318,6.7662,2.1031,2.6705,2.7195,1.8834,3.2962,3.1432,8.5663,2.1461,4.5412,2.0251,3.4636,2.1891,1.5097,5.3375,0.1904,1.44,3.2515,5.1484,1.1584,1.5126,2.3383,6.6226,0.9278,4.2248,2.1155,4.7676,2.8836,3.0541,1.537,3.6035,2.4971,0.2105,1.3993,0.5199,0.0694,2.2589,0.2243,4.3826,5.5483,6.1397,6.4656,2.1103,4.3024,0.1611,0.2187,5.6661,3.8749,4.2539,1.016,4.6461,1.8221,2.0625,1.8509,2.84,6.6119,0.8422,1.6016,2.2582,3.1227,5.5063,3.7746,2.5674,0.2569,1.8602,4.7019,0.5676,4.7321,0.8288,6.8545,0.5841,1.775,4.2806,0.7735,0.0039,1.2635,1.9938,1.4393,0.207,2.0673,3.4166,1.918,0.8559,4.7551,3.8167,6.1529,1.1409,1.1917,3.7254,0.031,0.1959,0.2634,5.5095,4.5081,5.4697,7.1131,2.6265,1.9286,1.888,3.286,2.0118,5.468,4.6149,4.3278,6.566,1.7621,5.6539,6.0312,1.8995,3.9721,5.8048,2.3801,2.7226,4.8976,0.6398,2.1749,2.4,2.0982,2.4005,4.8669,0.8392,0.6953,3.139,1.7992,4.0048,1.1,4.9782,3.5977,3.6659,0.0033,0.0756,0.0483,0.0256,5.388,3.1059,3.1525,4.1091,4.4936,3.462,0.4714,6.0496,0.0198,0.5631,2.0855,1.7478,2.089,5.7655,0.2684,6.5682,4.3716,1.6759,3.4018,6.8902,0.4118,3.1173,4.5136,1.2451,4.5613,2.899,14.6135,6.3711,8.6847,2.8927,2.3115,7.5939,1.7164,1.8485,1.5055,1.2363,2.5125,6.7847,0.2796,0.5549,4.5049,1.7925,2.0478,0.7147,3.1207,5.1524,3.2088,1.9515,0.3918,0.559,1.857,0.0914,1.0025,7.6843,2.1177,1.2111,0.3954,0.5957,2.6555,11.8434,6.49,3.7827,3.0723,0.7167,4.8926,0.0903,2.5936,4.6305,5.3463,0.012,3.7444,1.2686,3.9186,6.0757,0.0439,2.8894,3.9115,6.4656,1.5224,6.9714,2.7256,4.4134,0.4701,4.2786,0.5793,0.0661,5.9571,0.0918,0.6375,1.6067,4.1244,1.7028,0.7425,5.1722,6.336,0.0573,3.8679,0.2382,1.1586,3.2254,3.4177,4.3942,3.1682,3.4967,5.1198,1.2099,5.6306,0.4096,0.8389,1.8891,4.8523,1.258,4.5559,2.15,1.6732,4.6196,5.0044,3.8706,6.95,1.331,4.8518,0.5801,1.2623,1.3122,2.7214,0.4004,1.5763,2.9995,5.0023,0.8635,1.3092,0.9794,1.1363,3.8055,2.1753,4.6409,2.6522,5.6412,1.7556,4.0916,0.9582,0.7693,2.4893,5.6755,0.1145,4.4668,7.5951,4.4445,0.2583,4.3178,2.4367,0.736,5.0102,1.8304,3.9351,0.1455,2.5788,6.3824,0.0977,1.3355,4.4967,7.094,1.3377,5.021,1.3151,2.3274,0.6572,5.9647,2.8149,6.7925,0.6809,1.9971,8.0371,7.9808,1.4596,1.3416,1.6396,0.5685,5.1814,0.7698,1.7917,6.9417,2.4397,3.804,2.106,8.6832,3.8609,4.3194,0.5134,3.2078,3.6311,1.0778,4.5547,2.5911,2.4847,2.6263,5.8861,0.4053,1.2027,2.623,3.4052,0.5586,6.117,4.8943,0.8451,0.4631,2.4418,1.2878,4.0519,5.5604,0.5268,3.6283,0.3405,4.3074,0.1546,4.4401,2.5129,1.1379,1.6298,4.358,2.6393,2.1668,1.9807,3.4025,0.8391,0.1333,1.4422,2.9954,3.7705,5.0288,2.5495,6.5221,0.7547,0.2853,1.4218,6.5135,1.6779,1.8159,1.6642,2.0342,4.8006,3.3992,1.0912,1.1757,4.1537,0.9286,4.2981,0.0985,3.6057,1.6967,2.2216,0.8888,3.6597,1.0722,1.219,1.7697,1.7671,0.5825,4.8029,6.2012,1.5589,3.5571,0.1625,0.6195,5.2303,5.2191,5.2935,6.4151,1.4395,1.1624,6.375,3.28,0.7362,9.0655,1.5633,5.435,2.1464,1.4527,3.9725,0.7646,4.8054,0.7663,1.5286,2.3768,5.3623,0.8013,1.0259,4.8524,0.2325,4.808,0.3399,1.4942,0.0764,3.8662,1.1086,2.4683,2.8369,2.6633,14.5084,0.8957,11.0395,0.2634,3.5401,5.6499,4.7512,5.7334,1.6709,0.8705,1.5462,0.7557,0.5392,7.0168,9.1573,0.5241,6.487,0.0833,0.8251,9.0111,4.0315,5.1115,1.687,5.0457,6.0566,3.3932,0.1269,1.7609,2.2833,3.522,0.9483,0.3081,0.9265,3.0181,1.4212,6.5155,2.0239,3.766,1.1056,1.5967,3.1228,0.9908,2.17,2.0344,6.4488,5.2971,1.5171,0.3967,5.4646,0.3996,0.3328,0.0635,0.0241,3.0531,6.5445,0.1634,1.4684,5.2596,1.4183,0.0357,6.7139,0.0756,1.5298,3.7624,1.2117,3.8147,4.6957,0.9682,6.5496,4.7851,0.3025,1.8178,6.5971,0.1581,3.5277,16.2363,0.0279,4.5052,5.7138,2.3455,0.0132,0.5344,0.532,2.2016,4.3133,4.6748,7.3572,1.3495,3.3587,6.1935,3.0732,1.7822,4.0588,4.0987,6.9663,2.5404,2.9808,1.8066,0.425,0.3117,0.008,1.71,1.6615,0.3163,4.0775,8.1642,2.8029,2.3642,0.1878,1.0312,0.341,4.9784,2.5867,1.3242,0.9999,1.3963,4.2795,0.3201,0.9766,5.5599,1.653,4.2894,1.8566,12.8223,0.5288,5.8148,6.6861,0.253,3.7589,7.8739,3.0327,2.7269,6.4516,5.6233,4.2105,0.421,0.5995,0.3434,2.91,2.4153,0.4251,1.9069,1.5773,0.3134,3.6114,1.6446,0.1275,0.6136,3.6562,4.5274,3.5869,1.4584]}
{"prompt":"You find a stack of `` Missing Person '' papers under your parents ' bed . All with your photo .","text":"You find a stack of `` Missing Person '' papers under your parents'bed. All with your photo. Then you look at your Mom and dad and you can see the same fear.. and you have to get away before you fall prey to some of those things. They are so bad and will turn out something you don't like.\nI have always struggled with the fear of being lost, and being invisible. My mum has always had me in her shadow. My dad likes to be seen and seen to be popular. So even though my parents have not known each other as long as my brothers or I have, it does not feel like we have spent that many years with them.\nI was in foster care my entire first year of life, and stayed there for another year before the state realized that I was no longer there for their benefit and began my process to find my birth father (which he refused to see ) and my biological mother. The State was very interested in finding ways of getting my biological mother out of foster care, but I insisted on finding my birth father, and getting him to come and live with me.\nSince then, I have learned to let these feelings slip into the background, and to not have them dominate my life or put me out of balance.\nA couple days ago, I found a stack of papers containing photos of my mother and dad, and my 3 beautiful siblings. I got one and read it. I sat there thinking about what I had found and what I had thought I had said to my mother in the past. She did not even know she had a son and was now divorced and in a new relationship.\nI decided to go to my mother's new place and ask her if she had anything I needed. She told me that my dad had sent that, and asked how old I was.\nI cried a little and told her how much I was looking forward to having my dad and I get to stay in touch with each other and where he lives.\nI was very confused at first, but I don't think she blamed me. The feeling of not being there for her and being taken from her by the system was very real to her, and now, I was making her feel bad about having a problem with her own son.\nIt was not her fault that my parents divorced, and I do not know why I had thought that I had taken her from her.\nIt is one of those things you know is going to happen, yet sometimes it takes way longer than you want.\nYes!

{"prompt":"what is your favorite prompt you 've written ? post it here with the prompt that inspired it .","text":"what is your favorite prompt you've written? post it here with the prompt that inspired it. A good post goes a long way to make a good list.\nHow did you end up writing? My mom and dad both worked at the newspaper in the summer so I had to sit down and write when I got home from school. My mom usually would come and sit with me at my desk.\nWhat is your writing schedule like? I don't know what the schedule is for each of my blogs but I find this is how it works :\nMonday- write a post, make a new list, look at some old ones, make a list of what is to be sent out to others. Then I spend some time reading what others have said in order to learn from them.\nWednesday-there is a book party going on with the local Christian bookstore so get ready for bookish things.\nThursday- I have many things to send out so I go through my book and post box so I can make sure all I need to send out is there.\nFriday- finish the posts I have already written, make sure I have an assignment for the week and then think about what to write today.\nI hope everyone has a terrific day today! Our week is almost over so be sure to stay close to me. I am going to start thinking about my next reading and writing challenge (my blog post reading challenge and my post party and bookish themed challenges ) and I hope you will do the same. I am really looking forward to getting some other bookish stuff in order.\nHow about what I do (apart from my post party and bookish themed challenges ) to get other items accomplished :\nIn honor of Women\u2019s History Month, I thought I would put together a list of my favorite women and the book(s) they inspired me to write about them. This month is a particularly difficult one as there have been so many terrific women in history. Some of them are even my relatives! There is one in my family that I am especially proud to think of as an inspiration : Sarah J.\nSarah Jane Smith is the mother of Captain Marvel. Her character was first introduced in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz in which she was voiced by Julie Adams. She was not intended to be the main character. Her appearance was meant to be of an inspiration to Dorothy. This was the first movie where an actor played several characters in the same film.

{"prompt":"You wake up surrounded by a warm dark liquid . Upon further inspection you realise you are inside a womb .","text":"You wake up surrounded by a warm dark liquid. Upon further inspection you realise you are inside a womb. You lay in a pool of blood and see your legs and arms moving. You hear a voice inside you say \u201cyou have lived long enough dear one. Your time here on earth is done \u201d. The image that follows this point, of a woman wearing a wig and a long dress,with a long black scarf wrapped around her shoulders is repeated several times. You are aware of the voice but have little knowledge of the world around you. Eventually, you emerge from this pool and become aware of the darkness. It is your reality now. You can go out and see the sunlight again.\nThis journey goes through some of the worst experiences one can ever imagine. You feel like you are trapped. But eventually you can move freely through this dream. You have to be really careful to not get hurt so you do everything you can to stay out of the water. After each trip you move further and further away from the darkened world. Eventually you are standing at the edge of a dark river or lake. You can\u2019t get to the other side. It is too dangerous. You finally reach a river with a bridge at one side just to the horizon. You try to get to the other side. You can see the lights of a small town. You enter the bridge. You can see the lights and people on the other side. You can get out but they are trying to stop you. But you are strong and you move on and onto the other side. You see on the other side a river and a man walking out towards you. It looks nice, but the water is so cold it will kill you. Suddenly the man disappears. The water starts to swirl around the bridge. You realise the man was a spirit that has tricked you to get to this side. But now you have a new fear. Now you need to find your way back to the world. The man is just a trick. You have to get through the water to get back to the world.You try to swim back towards him but it is no use. But you don\u2019t want to swim back and just let him take you away again. Eventually you get so far away from the river and out of the water that you realise that you are still there and you still have to find a way back to the world. You see a building next to you that you could climb up. So you climb up the building and start walking over the top towards the bridge. You don\u2019t think that it is safe because the water is so deep. Luckily you can walk as high up the building as you wish. You start to walk to the other side of the bridge. You don\u2019t even see it anymore. You are sure that it isn\u2019t there because of the water. You can smell it and taste it. You can feel the cold water. You finally climb past the water and reach the other side of the bridge.","token_len":614,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,8.3018,0.0816,2.7741,6.6496,7.3301,6.6912,1.4603,7.914,4.6776,1.9651,2.4062,4.3577,2.1614,1.2454,4.772,0.5858,8.3371,0.8253,2.0099,4.9797,2.9669,1.229,3.1441,0.1384,1.2756,1.4603,4.8303,2.0626,5.1707,2.5499,1.7239,4.8452,1.2199,1.3678,3.6818,1.2249,3.3046,4.661,0.6968,2.6437,11.3382,7.0729,4.9035,3.4282,6.8776,2.6215,0.0359,11.6114,7.4135,3.0385,4.1428,6.36,3.9957,5.7463,1.444,0.991,5.2668,5.042,8.0103,5.8942,3.6848,6.3139,3.5539,4.3946,5.9837,6.0233,3.7938,3.8748,2.0039,2.9707,5.2245,0.6982,6.0883,1.0791,1.6813,3.767,2.6565,0.7928,12.719,1.1764,3.0835,3.0254,3.282,3.9578,0.0321,0.0544,2.9519,3.939,7.6414,3.4313,0.0322,1.13,2.2659,2.7052,4.9034,1.091,1.0761,4.4693,3.7199,3.9232,4.096,4.5572,0.2172,1.2718,4.8783,0.6928,0.0262,0.2912,5.9813,1.7618,0.6663,5.6474,0.4688,2.7989,3.9324,1.537,4.6602,1.5678,0.1788,0.9102,5.4069,2.4648,3.5132,0.4926,3.8007,7.1529,3.4191,0.8072,1.5102,3.7903,4.9694,4.0082,1.4926,2.8093,1.4786,7.6169,4.2827,0.7264,2.1674,6.3362,6.1453,5.6913,2.8714,4.268,2.6332,0.1709,5.2843,3.6858,4.8761,0.6113,1.2645,2.8619,0.3566,1.8223,3.2097,2.7451,0.6332,0.7965,3.414,2.4776,4.2129,5.3507,0.7126,3.5683,3.8281,4.2767,2.9413,2.3586,5.2991,1.3726,1.1336,3.127,3.2331,3.4277,5.7407,1.7444,3.3136,1.0584,2.3519,3.0062,5.4537,1.1034,3.5169,5.4504,0.815,0.0256,0.1415,2.3471,3.6399,0.021,1.4426,3.5681,0.3662,4.5944,6.0627,3.4618,0.8446,5.4025,4.625,1.0181,0.0943,0.8911,0.4465,0.5112,8.3304,2.3336,0.6695,2.8944,0.4324,2.419,5.9341,2.8186,0.6531,1.2291,0.0131,0.872,3.9336,3.7812,4.3221,2.1668,0.7194,1.2317,2.4313,17.5963,7.9118,1.6733,2.6313,2.9844,1.2672,3.7546,0.104,1.4831,2.6284,0.5529,3.299,1.4187,1.0593,1.3835,7.1303,1.7252,1.5322,3.9474,3.9996,1.0513,5.3026,4.9759,2.8631,2.5658,7.3212,2.1957,1.4222,7.5489,0.2519,1.1788,4.5072,0.3443,2.3076,1.41,0.6778,0.1524,0.0409,2.1402,1.4877,2.1992,2.6639,1.0272,5.396,1.4738,2.7349,3.7588,1.7487,2.2913,0.9772,6.5479,1.2571,5.06,1.6393,1.1872,2.324,0.7333,0.8008,3.412,3.7359,4.5414,3.51,0.2834,0.976,0.0134,0.7492,0.7737,1.6242,4.3054,2.473,4.7074,4.4585,0.8284,6.184,0.0695,2.8843,0.0257,0.3646,3.8371,0.847,1.9212,6.6168,1.5756,1.2435,5.3968,2.9908,3.4034,6.3371,0.4374,0.5003,0.017,0.3831,1.1411,2.4374,6.8926,0.24,0.2388,0.0238,1.7971,4.0227,2.1977,1.7994,4.1597,3.9969,4.395,4.7812,1.0123,0.2598,3.7569,3.7765,6.9948,2.6626,0.7263,2.9842,2.6045,0.5222,2.6747,1.1971,3.0995,3.8421,2.8031,0.1464,0.5079,4.7675,2.2918,1.5216,3.9591,0.8008,2.2516,2.0115,2.9834,0.5043,4.9687,0.6336,2.7595,2.3229,0.7133,0.9838,6.0086,2.9601,0.609,2.7192,3.4761,7.4561,3.7039,4.317,9.0895,0.1853,3.9225,3.8727,1.5051,2.4456,3.6398,0.7689,3.1198,3.3379,0.7016,2.1849,3.1173,3.0638,5.6775,0.7802,5.3781,0.4453,4.0402,0.0826,2.6129,2.2519,0.6814,0.8885,0.8265,0.5418,3.4185,1.2972,2.9056,2.7979,1.3498,5.506,2.2619,6.3873,2.3782,1.256,2.6439,0.5001,3.0485,3.4416,1.3294,2.8399,2.4678,1.5528,1.6996,0.3645,0.4928,0.8369,0.3302,8.3053,4.4749,0.2885,3.1376,1.7846,4.5404,5.7078,0.9647,2.8816,0.788,5.5069,1.0453,0.2279,3.9909,1.3775,4.6031,4.7456,0.3515,0.0241,2.54,0.0567,1.6972,0.8583,3.5632,6.2421,4.6008,1.3775,5.0313,0.2707,2.3487,3.7063,0.0918,4.7841,0.4897,2.6978,6.6224,1.1434,0.7015,0.7545,0.6202,1.8054,2.4258,4.4004,0.5691,0.3291,1.0837,0.9513,0.5353,3.7679,1.6778,0.842,0.6477,3.7282,2.5121,3.2317,1.4623,4.9466,0.681,1.2299,3.6225,2.6554,0.0865,0.6928,1.1583,0.2706,0.3659,0.12,1.2702,3.7078,1.4986,5.8127,4.5669,0.0167,1.0786,2.9727,1.635,3.4856,4.1342,1.9777,0.7195,5.5915,0.2173,1.6772,0.4466,2.0548,0.7842,0.7716,3.7561,2.5969,5.3863,1.4729,3.6281,7.1066,0.5832,3.6286,0.1585,1.0893,4.2261,0.0483,0.0991,0.0004,4.1195,2.3947,2.4064,0.54,2.82,3.7232,2.0676,1.6774,0.5397,0.759,4.5627,0.8512,7.4364,0.7235,1.9628,3.757,5.6164,3.1253,3.6297,1.6013,0.8293,0.3586,0.1048,3.5172,0.4775,1.1481,3.4917,0.8163,2.0627,3.3646,0.3748,1.7648,0.045,0.9997,0.0331,0.4979,0.7362,0.9766,4.0448,0.0128,0.0238,0.0005,3.7399,4.3826,3.0263,2.634,0.3736,0.938,2.0513,5.6301,0.4278,1.7426,4.3328,0.4525,0.4293,0.0788,2.5597,4.555,2.2015,0.4676,1.7021,0.4121,1.0814,2.8323,6.2821,1.083,2.0196,4.879,0.138,0.6099,0.8848,1.9585,1.3428,1.1449,3.9239,2.8333,2.2054,0.6686,5.5513,5.2511,6.806,0.3091,2.4047,0.795,3.2241,0.4751,1.4455,0.0509,0.5401,0.0121,0.165,0.1199]}

{"prompt":"You crash on as island . The locals , impressed with your technology , start showing you their magic . You have a scientific explanation for everything , but one thing still puzzles you .","text":"You crash on as island. The locals, impressed with your technology, start showing you their magic. You have a scientific explanation for everything, but one thing still puzzles you. You have taken over their lives, their culture, their language and yet their spirit remains intact. Why does their humanity exist in the dark and mysterious shadows?\nThis beautifully drawn story is a journey of discovery. From the ancient gods to the technological innovations. A strange feeling at the end of life, when you finally discover that the secrets we carry are not always those we want to hear. This is a story about how important it is not to hold on to the secrets that you know the secret. They will only keep you alive the time you carry them. You must allow them to rest. The truth must be spoken.\nIt is so amazing to hear that this book is so well received. It sounds intriguing and it is worth reading.\nOne final thank you to everybody who supported my campaign for the last 5 weeks. From the beginning of the process on January 3, all the way to yesterday, there has been a huge amount of amazing support and thank you\u2019s. I\u2019d like to reiterate, the last thing I wanted to do was put myself on the campaign so I could help promote other authors and share their ideas with you. I\u2019m so grateful for all of the feedback I received about the book.\nThere are many great books out there. The ones that I mention in this book are the ones I love and that I feel will be a success for people. I did not receive any compensation for this book and no one else in the book either.\nI am also doing a pre-order party for this one starting Sunday. If you pre-order the book between now and the party start time on Sunday Nov 5th you get some pretty sweet bonus content and prizes! There will be a book deal, a prize pack, an exclusive cover reveal and more. If you don\u2019t want to pre-order you can buy on Tuesday or Wednesday as well.\nWhat is a Pre-Order Party? It\u2019s a simple way to get some bonus content and prizes for buying a book before it\u2019s released. Usually what I\u2019ll do is get a pre-order party up and run for a few days. But due to how long the Book Promotions has been out, I can\u2019t get the pre-order party finished in time. I could finish it, but it would take days. At this point I need it to be finished so I\u2019m holding off on that. But if you pre-order the book before Nov 5th you can get some awesome extras by pre-ordering and get free bookmarks and a promo link to share on Facebook or Instagram.\nLet\u2019s Talk Book Promotion \u2013 Let\u2019s talk about book promotion (which is where this post came from) and I want to discuss some ideas.

How much do they weigh? Will they stretch? And why, if it\u2019s for a wedding, are there so many different gowns to choose from? Thankfully there is one important factor \u2013 the material! The fabrics we use to make our clothes today are more breathable than ever, meaning sweating is a thing of the past!\nThe materials used to make your dress will dictate all the major decisions you will face on your wedding day. While silk, lace or organza are a few of the most popular fabric choices, choosing your wedding gown is much more than a choice of color. In addition to whether you\u2019d love organza or lace for your wedding day, you need to decide if the dress fits your body type, your style and budget.\nTo make choosing your new gown that little bit simpler, we\u2019ve collected some of the most commonly used wedding gown fabrics and their characteristics. Read on to learn our top tips when choosing your wedding gown fabric.\nIf you\u2019re after something funky, you could go for sheer lace. The lace is just light enough to show off some skin, but is still very elegant. You could also opt for sheer satin to add a bit more shine and intricacy for your wedding garment.\nOrganza is another stunning choice with a light and soft feel. It is often used to design lace and silk organza is known for its sheer texture and great shine. Even though organza is a semi-transparent material, it has a natural airy texture that can enhance the quality of your wedding gown, especially on a hot day when it\u2019s not as dark as satin.\nYou wouldn\u2019t wear a wedding gown made of satin all day. This rich fabric is not as breathable as the other choices and can make even your wedding gown uncomfortable. The texture of satin also can seem a bit rough and it wears much faster than lace and organza.","token_len":615,"entropy":[7.7451,6.1848,4.8449,12.2544,2.6718,1.3487,4.4296,3.817,4.7149,1.8643,3.9755,1.763,0.9011,8.505,3.7063,2.4671,2.8253,5.3243,1.97,9.0349,1.4975,3.9848,2.263,2.0616,4.8645,1.656,3.5247,8.1029,2.8545,5.6739,1.5522,5.4218,1.5276,6.4745,3.6475,3.8864,1.7388,2.6372,3.054,3.9398,1.174,2.0511,2.7744,4.4692,0.4083,0.6465,3.6477,0.507,3.6491,2.8224,6.4225,5.7685,9.2589,3.5748,3.9179,6.6096,15.5274,0.5709,0.929,3.909,0.2803,0.3433,1.9091,4.4108,1.5613,1.7221,2.5538,2.1918,5.0465,5.4413,1.8598,5.9387,0.2011,0.2416,3.6116,1.7773,1.7618,1.769,3.4787,0.9321,2.2829,6.0406,4.3633,3.1124,3.4289,4.5036,2.417,4.5388,8.4135,5.936,3.4102,0.6913,0.3678,0.2054,0.9628,3.8353,4.4479,0.1081,0.7883,2.5029,1.1383,1.6634,0.9535,0.3341,3.8796,1.2509,0.573,3.6308,4.1031,3.4549,2.599,3.9816,4.2468,7.6699,3.8139,3.8319,5.4752,6.4011,2.5105,0.0584,2.3233,2.0092,2.7579,1.0594,0.4447,2.4475,2.4828,1.8328,0.6763,3.0009,4.0091,4.6224,0.7334,2.3772,4.363,1.5013,5.2713,0.9496,4.5814,10.5599,4.4668,0.1432,8.2637,2.4056,2.949,1.2985,4.7728,1.6911,2.5885,0.9033,1.7251,5.5295,2.0225,1.5389,4.1773,3.3759,1.1625,4.0878,3.4428,1.1241,4.8745,1.3358,0.0105,0.7298,9.3732,3.6306,1.544,4.7134,2.4133,1.4199,1.9686,0.0235,0.0823,0.2563,1.3748,0.1032,0.059,3.8051,0.7155,4.4925,5.5235,2.6976,0.1212,0.052,4.0351,5.4361,2.5295,4.0732,2.9973,0.2705,0.16,0.4014,5.8747,2.0858,4.0053,1.4059,0.0277,3.6352,0.4709,2.405,0.3254,1.1231,4.7695,17.0254,7.713,3.7251,4.9225,1.1139,2.1225,3.9755,2.0559,1.5399,0.8282,10.1273,10.5946,7.284,1.5304,6.1466,1.9357,1.9167,3.3459,5.211,0.9748,4.9088,0.4956,5.8887,1.177,3.7981,4.2975,5.3934,2.3926,3.1043,9.5017,0.3913,0.2133,4.7455,2.2782,4.5924,1.3758,4.3556,3.0458,2.8531,0.0325,1.9441,6.8918,0.4808,2.0909,0.015,0.0645,0.4677,9.6887,2.1949,1.1413,2.6994,6.0758,2.2324,6.2081,2.5981,6.3762,4.2208,3.1942,4.1141,4.8997,1.1484,2.8067,0.7451,0.3408,1.7239,7.3877,0.4339,5.1162,6.4778,0.0308,1.2587,1.277,2.9079,4.677,10.7476,1.6258,2.8536,5.0421,1.7067,0.0392,0.0029,2.1921,1.7556,2.6247,5.1222,1.8855,1.03,0.1439,3.4047,4.5321,3.3394,6.97,6.0572,1.1634,6.0752,3.748,0.8317,1.6799,2.6565,3.0474,0.6177,1.4349,0.0703,0.5447,6.056,7.7283,1.5703,5.5089,2.7113,10.061,1.7444,1.1307,3.7342,2.2272,0.7987,0.1735,1.4835,1.5788,3.6444,2.1393,0.6744,6.3155,3.4279,4.2375,2.2776,1.7246,3.8233,0.4993,2.9434,2.8992,2.5628,0.9717,3.4368,0.699,4.1647,3.0773,0.5656,7.1988,1.2396,11.4704,0.2408,3.5469,4.9994,10.024,0.0221,0.5092,3.6741,4.9501,1.0693,1.9997,3.652,0.4186,2.3742,4.4389,0.2163,1.9229,2.8264,2.4334,3.2593,4.2511,1.3233,1.8525,2.7143,1.5017,2.9441,2.3198,1.1625,5.0452,0.3454,1.3404,4.399,2.3091,3.3842,0.503,5.8415,2.4433,4.8986,5.1263,0.1972,3.857,0.4774,2.3865,5.3644,0.1576,1.0499,6.0414,2.472,1.034,0.1519,0.8986,4.3287,0.3291,4.3915,0.6477,1.795,1.7149,5.0063,4.6778,0.7352,6.408,0.8448,0.5829,1.7473,5.3929,2.7431,2.952,5.3999,0.4474,0.9075,2.0937,0.4445,3.2401,0.6954,0.3558,4.0419,0.2486,3.5279,0.0436,4.0999,7.3078,3.4263,7.8951,1.0954,2.4785,4.3469,3.6261,1.1748,8.9291,2.7879,2.2217,2.7622,2.5959,1.3413,5.2529,8.0992,1.7391,0.8261,5.2789,0.9697,5.3965,4.7999,1.6313,0.9748,3.6372,3.5216,2.7576,6.8106,0.9141,3.4611,1.8183,1.3922,2.7244,0.0809,4.8453,5.6994,0.0067,4.3996,2.3689,1.2485,1.6066,1.9509,3.9534,1.776,9.5685,0.0215,5.1807,0.6426,3.0396,8.7491,0.1476,0.8674,7.5387,0.0194,1.4228,3.7766,7.7116,2.1684,4.1534,1.4333,3.5958,2.2935,3.2827,1.6839,0.9241,1.4031,0.9654,4.3612,1.6584,2.2509,5.01,6.3803,3.0157,5.088,8.598,0.034,4.1972,5.526,0.4389,0.575,4.4452,2.9004,1.3433,5.5031,5.9537,0.2048,5.5812,1.2122,4.8242,0.005,0.5014,1.9342,7.1525,0.4003,2.4452,0.2174,1.5001,0.4047,0.7297,2.6391,0.9185,4.3286,7.1331,2.0193,1.7695,1.9239,2.8808,5.3914,1.2314,5.4997,0.0917,0.4294,2.5229,1.8903,4.0797,2.3457,3.9784,2.6609,3.2459,0.3936,4.0093,2.2063,4.8046,0.0477,0.1178,2.766,4.3667,4.3591,0.275,5.0458,0.0091,0.3299,0.6308,3.496,7.5874,0.0786,0.1646,0.2399,6.8625,1.3738,4.7497,0.6182,4.4264,1.1535,2.0962,0.0029,5.4582,0.4824,1.8236,3.4934,8.7021,3.8481,1.287,4.072,3.8206,5.0229,0.009,0.4628,3.1602,2.5327,4.315,2.1342,2.3296,3.9335,5.8217,2.5992,3.6567,1.3514,5.2871,1.1445,2.8807,6.3445,0.7771,1.2807,0.0032,2.9032,3.3039,6.4238,1.9001,0.5852,4.6171,2.1736,3.1842,9.7415,5.0102,4.3985,1.3259,4.6854,2.7042,3.5598,0.0013,0.4604]}
{"prompt":"Your girlfriend is a serial killer who has been at large for years . You found out one day upon walking into her apartment and seeing her at work . You never help her with her hobby or express any signs of discomfort when with her and that just baffles her . You just do n't care about it .","text":"Your girlfriend is a serial killer who has been at large for years. You found out one day upon walking into her apartment and seeing her at work. You never help her with her hobby or express any signs of discomfort when with her and that just baffles her. You just don't care about it. She has no idea it has become a big issue for you.\n1. First of all, you will have to make it clear to her what you think of how her lifestyle is affecting her. You will have to explain the possible signs to her and ask her for advice on how to stop this cycle and what you can do about it. The second thing is to set a limit. Be clear when the situation starts to strain you.\n2. For example, maybe you both agree to go shopping in your times off without her knowing. You both need to be clear about how much time you're planning to be spending with her in that time and how much time she can spend with you.\n3. Now your girlfriend has been with you for a while now and the routine is fine. You both manage. Maybe the problem is that her hobby has become even more important in her life than your relationship, and she doesn't feel that if you do not know the new project she is working on, her confidence as a woman will be lowered. How to explain it to her then? In addition, is the way she dresses also a challenge? In this case, what can you do? It seems that it's normal to care what your girlfriend wears and like to dress up, that there is a certain trend in her life, so how can you explain that she doesn't have to change her appearance just because you think it is cool? A lot of men do not notice this. They do not pay attention to the clothes of their girlfriends. They are interested in what they like and not how they are dressed.\n4. Maybe it's a little early to be afraid of how she lives. But you can still say something nice, even if it is obvious for you that your girlfriend is not very happy with the lifestyle you have with her. But if it is obvious to you that your girlfriend has always been a fan of the movies and books you both have, and you are not, then that is really a problem. You'd just have to stop her from going out every Friday night and tell her that her hobby is better than what you guys do together.\nI know it may sound overly aggressive to say this, but if you really want a long-term relationship, you cannot just play at home and ignore how another person lives her life.

You are walking down the aisle and just as the Priest if 'you do ', you get a prophetic vision that the marriage will end in a horrible breakup. The priest asks again, `` Do you take... '' and she says to him : '' the man with the scarlet letter on his left arm ''. The first few years are tough. You get divorced on a regular basis. Then one day, your beautiful blonde hair turns gray. She starts crying, and says. '' I know I made a mistake. Look, I am not mad at you anymore. You did what you thought was right, and for you. It is important on your last days, to be able to say yes to God and make it right. ''\nI can only get by with a hand and a prayer from God. I have been a good wife, but also been a bad one. I have been good to him and to our kids. I have done some really good things for my family. We have been very close for 20, 25 years and it is so hard to break that relationship. I have so many issues I am not sure how to handle. He and I broke up because he had an affair during our marriage. I did not realize or tell my husband of that affair. I did not know it was a crime, that I had committed. What my husband needs to know is if I were to find out that my marriage was ended because of my husband cheating. I am not going to accept that. I am not going to allow him to destroy my life and that of my children. I am not going to allow my children and my children and his children suffer because of infidelity.\nIt is not his fault. it is my fault, for failing to protect him, and for not caring about my relationship. Maybe there was some guilt that came to me, as I was feeling some guilt that I was the one to fall in love with him. I thought that if I could just be good at my job, and take care of my family, that I would be happy. My job at that time was a job I loved and I had great health insurance. Well, I failed. I failed in all my responsibilities. Well, you see, my family is going to suffer for my mistakes. But, I never thought that it would affect their careers, or their income. My family is going to suffer because my husband cheated on me. They need to know that I am not going to sit back and accept his cheating. I will not allow my family to be slandered like that.\nWhat I am going to do, is to be there for the kids. To hold their hands and to give them love and care. I want them to know that I am going to help them. I am going to do whatever it is that I can to help them. My kids are adults now and they have to move on. They need to build a good future for themselves. They are going to have to start over.","token_len":617,"entropy":[4.0658,4.3549,6.2916,0.9847,1.5013,3.1943,2.3288,7.7303,2.4008,0.6723,1.4942,2.4082,6.222,4.2509,3.3534,11.4312,10.8181,7.3651,4.5956,4.7798,10.8213,1.2853,4.2734,1.706,8.4053,3.8497,2.602,3.8965,8.2503,2.093,2.6232,2.3556,2.2622,5.6719,8.0431,0.575,2.9958,3.9241,4.6544,8.0791,1.4873,9.0937,6.6407,0.2401,6.6977,7.5417,5.5848,1.6925,5.164,1.3635,4.0681,0.9182,7.4316,2.0747,7.2479,4.7963,5.2457,1.0369,5.4697,2.3548,3.5409,4.6781,0.5861,3.1978,2.5142,7.4798,8.3646,2.7972,5.9373,5.148,2.8718,2.7403,3.7752,1.2888,2.2362,3.4076,5.4282,4.8638,2.3221,2.6559,0.0156,0.9885,3.582,4.255,0.3368,1.5975,2.9317,6.2329,7.0941,3.5064,3.0409,3.86,1.2349,3.6241,4.2685,1.984,2.181,1.3545,3.442,5.7823,2.3668,2.7061,3.857,2.6399,5.476,1.1617,0.2801,0.8354,5.9338,1.4473,0.8636,2.8817,1.8597,5.3977,1.3153,0.2119,4.4399,0.4683,2.1395,4.0213,2.0222,0.4722,2.8438,0.828,0.2351,2.1658,1.0706,5.476,3.4418,3.6368,3.3128,1.4547,4.3965,7.4824,1.6501,6.2023,3.242,2.3094,3.0862,2.2273,2.6585,0.0045,2.3909,4.8381,0.571,3.7673,1.9872,4.4819,2.3233,1.1108,0.7619,5.0697,3.4055,4.339,3.7207,3.3161,5.9803,5.0347,1.3343,2.5378,7.0309,3.6067,1.1028,2.5212,4.4467,1.9955,0.8222,1.6882,2.5557,2.3454,3.9174,3.8935,2.7511,1.8686,2.381,5.9661,6.2106,1.4291,1.5723,1.7301,0.3072,1.0231,1.8547,1.6043,5.9932,1.5521,4.8498,1.9851,1.893,4.6169,3.194,0.8579,0.8456,1.0248,3.0473,4.7912,3.9422,0.9896,0.2703,1.6728,1.2603,1.136,1.0166,4.1458,1.3421,1.7685,3.1007,2.6766,2.7656,4.6869,5.105,2.4341,0.0867,2.3088,3.1103,0.8764,4.0171,1.655,0.6812,4.6588,2.5601,3.861,0.4987,1.3309,2.0492,6.072,0.7664,4.5153,3.3854,2.1867,2.3082,1.3253,1.5877,0.5527,2.4219,1.2319,5.2512,5.0032,0.3396,6.4539,0.1205,2.0696,2.1856,2.9327,2.7676,0.4403,6.959,1.8901,0.4244,0.673,1.4261,3.732,0.5854,4.5741,6.7187,6.5182,2.7361,1.6309,3.4072,1.5031,2.9578,1.0375,1.1749,2.222,0.1312,1.256,3.0386,0.6685,2.1221,4.7428,2.1007,3.3012,1.6404,1.4305,2.9697,2.4778,4.9246,5.4724,0.4666,5.7841,1.6667,0.9945,0.3602,3.9949,1.1931,4.7019,1.0243,5.1251,0.4405,2.1812,1.5089,2.5829,0.7563,5.5011,3.3341,0.5352,2.3555,2.9902,4.021,5.4684,1.2369,1.8694,1.4966,1.7409,0.0482,5.1559,0.8329,1.2775,0.8947,1.1884,0.9208,0.26,0.005,4.2121,2.6617,0.1659,5.1972,0.8653,1.4472,2.0308,4.0155,0.8556,0.2728,0.862,0.4631,0.8319,0.9618,0.6959,0.1209,0.0057,1.5973,1.7615,1.4665,4.6662,1.2134,2.2046,3.3738,4.7228,0.9344,9.573,2.1991,0.2843,9.2447,0.012,0.4412,3.1266,3.9141,0.5581,2.3369,5.6263,0.1834,1.2077,7.6683,0.254,2.1294,0.2008,2.8551,3.7425,5.8828,0.3497,3.2364,2.1055,2.5654,1.6586,0.9005,2.1707,4.0024,1.4405,1.8458,5.3011,1.3672,6.9483,4.2622,2.5879,1.8372,4.4787,2.8074,2.893,4.0147,1.2656,2.3154,4.9162,1.459,1.8048,5.2864,5.1236,1.1301,2.1036,1.1947,1.811,4.1356,1.0065,2.2544,6.3926,0.9434,0.043,0.1572,1.2108,0.6123,1.5104,4.7749,1.8751,2.6565,0.4657,2.9503,3.2581,3.5456,4.7478,3.5504,2.0835,0.0927,0.8643,2.4252,4.4468,0.3631,0.0064,0.8542,1.447,0.5748,2.4305,1.0235,0.7493,0.8695,2.7084,1.0576,4.2651,2.9819,4.9329,3.0309,0.6323,0.3739,3.6527,2.3691,1.9238,2.8481,1.8012,2.0574,2.8031,4.4179,4.6725,1.863,0.7282,6.1145,0.33,1.0373,5.9095,2.3456,0.797,2.5513,3.1589,3.5277,1.6469,3.6513,0.8566,5.1333,0.1413,4.3653,2.7093,0.3451,2.2411,3.6395,1.8413,3.9798,1.314,3.2181,3.5722,3.3413,4.9719,0.5562,3.3666,2.9302,1.2887,5.2521,2.9428,0.9626,3.1221,0.3802,4.3598,4.1664,5.4317,1.8266,1.9884,0.9669,6.4129,0.6006,2.8508,1.6019,0.9974,0.5218,0.074,0.3392,1.3116,3.2611,1.1363,0.5535,0.434,1.1345,0.5444,3.618,4.8636,0.9808,1.7389,0.5574,1.7868,1.3313,1.2127,1.547,0.0246,6.0364,1.8039,0.1837,3.2544,5.3296,2.2346,0.6239,1.3663,2.4799,1.3865,2.7941,2.0114,1.2135,0.2372,2.3457,8.1733,0.1483,0.0039,4.074,0.9059,0.3254,1.7076,4.0547,1.7175,1.7199,1.0924,0.0499,0.2515,2.5811,1.0298,1.6291,3.58,4.7665,0.5126,2.4565,2.8672,1.0299,4.641,5.0822,3.4727,1.3347,0.916,3.0429,3.2733,0.2245,3.8692,1.1744,3.8879,0.5504,1.0746,2.7285,0.8162,0.0844,1.379,0.2101,1.0597,0.9994,3.2317,0.0374,2.8784,0.1747,1.6535,0.6708,1.6939,0.3698,0.008,3.073,3.5412,0.6383,3.4688,0.9708,0.9299,0.3202,0.5345,0.737,0.2844,0.7031,3.5026,2.9516,1.146,8.0142,2.8266,1.8601,1.2453,2.3754,2.6738,5.9787,0.5572,0.9186,2.0729,1.7664,0.6808,7.7529,1.4479,4.1218,1.876,1.0731,0.4575,0.9682,2.0539,2.1501,1.2883,0.0271,1.5659,0.741,4.1534,2.1585,0.7899]}
{"prompt":"You have been a serial killer for 25 years , and the cops have no idea you exist . One day you wake up strapped to a table . You hear a voice say , `` I have been watching you for some time . ''","text":"You have been a serial killer for 25 years, and the cops have no idea you exist. One day you wake up strapped to a table. You hear a voice say, `` I have been watching you for some time. '' Its the voice of God, and you are meant to fulfill a task he has provided you with. Is this something you want? How can you be sure that this is exactly what you are supposed to do? Will you be able to live with yourself? And what will they think of you when they find out that you killed all those people you are responsible for?''\nYou would not know any better than I do. Not the next day, not the next week, not the next year, not the next century. You are not the world. You are not the time. You are not the sun. You are not the moon. You are not the stars. You are not the earth. You are not the universe. You are not the consciousness residing as many of us. You are none of the ones you have ever known. You are everything and nothing. All exist together, without any of the things you imagine being true about what you are. Are you prepared for it?\nEvery now and then, I will take you and look at you. I will stare at you and wait for your answer. What do you want to be?\nIt never rains when you see the right tree. So why not turn it into your next blog post? Because it\u2019s rainy everywhere else. You have to stay with your topic, which is making blog posts.\nI had my friend ask me a few weeks ago, if I had ever thought about being a writer; I honestly had no idea the answer. Now, thanks to a friend\u2019s post the other day, I thought that maybe I could learn a little something from her. She said that even though she had been an editor for a company that specializes in making money blogs (she said) she had made her dreams come true.\nI\u2019m thinking that one day may be my time to become a writer. I mean, don\u2019t you just want to write about what inspires you? I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to learn something new?\nHere\u2019s the reality, if I keep writing about my fears, my past, and my future, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t go crazy by now because I\u2019ve been doing that for a whole long time. But just maybe if someone were to come by and read it, see the beauty that I see (it\u2019s a real beauty to me).\nLet\u2019s go through a quick list. If you can write about a lot of things then you are probably a writer, but if you\u2019ve been reading this blog for a while and you haven\u2019t read anything with purpose for a while, you\u2019re probably not. But you can still be a writer by writing about what excites you.","token_len":617,"entropy":[3.7506,3.1059,3.9758,7.6858,0.8732,0.8796,3.9005,0.0418,1.6888,1.3025,3.7896,6.6014,2.1297,3.4597,0.7645,3.419,4.4144,0.8725,5.9382,2.285,1.5484,4.63,0.0261,9.1359,0.5094,0.59,4.0251,3.4023,1.4914,3.9596,1.3435,3.1776,1.807,0.6595,8.6371,8.6803,3.1386,2.1587,4.9903,0.8064,1.0446,4.3117,0.2313,1.0952,5.0435,8.4337,3.4064,1.6497,0.3669,5.6705,1.7448,1.9302,1.1196,2.7879,8.1666,0.0617,7.6865,4.1404,4.5058,4.5669,1.046,7.205,0.5804,0.6714,0.8015,5.6425,1.9498,4.4413,0.6437,2.3863,1.8392,5.0463,1.8057,0.3192,1.9061,3.0799,2.1238,2.9366,0.9403,5.9765,0.1876,0.6926,1.8158,2.5518,0.0009,0.4519,0.2968,6.1017,0.4582,2.0855,1.2081,0.0046,5.1222,1.1524,2.9718,1.4414,3.5303,2.1277,2.0348,5.5946,3.1391,0.6322,0.2703,2.4075,0.8849,2.8087,0.1536,1.6742,0.2368,4.9093,5.2774,2.4221,1.3602,2.44,5.4075,5.553,0.006,0.8579,2.9997,1.5046,9.3072,4.6751,2.6338,2.9849,5.113,0.181,1.458,2.0776,2.1387,1.0782,5.6254,4.3812,5.8522,1.1794,1.207,1.4506,0.5241,0.4964,1.484,0.5944,0.6025,0.2801,0.261,1.2158,1.057,0.8802,0.2794,0.2023,3.9434,0.4956,2.1064,1.8969,1.9536,2.7086,5.3713,3.0612,0.7976,0.4587,0.7987,1.1764,5.9088,0.4353,0.7122,0.3259,0.2968,0.3829,6.6439,0.203,0.5595,0.2155,0.2015,0.3216,1.5211,0.0616,0.5635,0.1561,0.1403,0.3207,0.8329,0.088,0.6038,0.1137,0.165,0.3505,3.1268,0.1109,0.6298,0.0918,0.1116,0.2599,2.6034,0.1388,0.8616,0.1119,0.1467,0.3441,6.1187,11.2477,7.4395,6.7328,2.6808,0.8969,3.2044,0.7281,0.1568,6.709,0.1988,2.3681,6.7973,2.6955,2.4293,2.844,1.2497,0.3843,0.8024,0.2976,6.1992,4.6194,0.4307,1.1474,4.199,8.745,6.2426,1.9232,4.1348,1.6747,3.3478,1.4803,4.5244,1.0858,6.1615,3.7321,4.0195,4.7341,6.6015,0.8827,0.816,0.5289,6.3919,0.2439,6.1718,1.6108,3.7997,0.1685,2.4103,5.3783,4.8819,0.0112,0.1151,0.9813,1.5948,2.8987,4.352,3.1007,4.7561,5.1215,0.9563,0.3977,1.2939,1.4417,0.3085,5.1781,0.4582,0.1615,2.6513,6.1495,0.5074,2.332,1.2084,0.2068,4.8447,2.0964,0.1202,1.941,2.1984,2.6847,0.6493,2.9232,3.9449,5.9792,4.7575,4.6769,1.027,4.3947,1.9288,7.3678,5.7367,0.7658,5.9143,3.7068,1.9715,5.364,1.6228,1.8297,4.1679,6.0846,9.0754,1.11,0.314,4.6847,1.7079,15.7842,7.062,1.8568,8.3099,6.4633,5.2476,0.5654,2.845,2.78,2.016,4.1472,4.6443,2.087,8.7508,1.8279,3.932,0.6415,6.7386,8.4574,0.1741,1.0977,2.2629,2.4832,5.047,4.0623,6.5705,4.5695,0.312,2.6798,2.0673,3.6121,0.1307,2.0225,2.8016,0.6725,2.5297,1.7579,3.0882,0.9786,3.8483,0.7407,1.8927,6.5185,1.3737,5.662,3.2855,0.4476,0.1297,5.8226,0.5129,0.9989,4.7138,1.2868,6.4394,0.1739,3.0914,2.7035,6.9767,0.4884,1.2136,4.2197,6.9295,5.2799,0.0825,0.3538,0.354,5.0733,3.0324,3.073,0.6356,2.2498,4.7933,1.9131,2.0465,2.2347,1.5929,2.1075,0.5028,2.7841,2.4435,1.113,5.4328,0.8917,1.4118,2.5168,2.2909,4.3927,2.4737,0.7184,1.5675,7.868,2.1636,4.2852,0.0045,3.7399,4.2761,9.6286,4.196,2.5436,4.3025,6.1727,1.3951,1.6378,5.7206,2.8393,4.8864,0.0971,0.0048,0.6869,1.658,1.7617,8.2566,0.3259,0.2727,4.5415,2.7375,5.0573,0.1417,8.6044,1.816,2.8903,2.6125,0.9501,4.4625,0.4318,0.3394,0.494,1.5353,3.4949,0.3456,5.6935,1.8367,1.1226,0.223,1.6315,4.3382,1.496,0.2213,1.5973,1.4785,3.1733,5.9455,0.3311,0.7988,2.3779,1.305,0.2046,3.7031,1.7873,0.2134,0.1033,0.1118,0.6134,0.1043,4.0559,2.2104,2.8604,0.9756,1.2084,4.9717,2.4757,0.0966,0.0943,1.996,5.8641,2.833,3.3668,1.815,5.4965,1.642,1.4709,2.8055,7.106,1.3133,2.3805,6.567,1.5321,1.7245,0.5648,1.1404,1.143,1.0569,3.1773,0.0463,1.3543,3.7663,1.8076,4.1209,1.2013,0.0091,1.1366,5.1784,3.8755,5.1408,5.4962,5.4373,0.5617,3.513,0.0129,3.0446,1.5462,3.5149,3.5058,0.5647,1.8979,6.2294,3.1312,0.0217,0.3198,2.588,4.9595,5.317,4.0397,5.8943,4.132,0.1179,3.1457,4.1922,0.6265,4.2857,3.1827,0.6661,7.5735,3.2909,3.5296,3.7066,1.6337,3.6255,6.5464,3.903,1.014,0.0191,0.1849,2.3864,4.4045,3.6626,3.7334,1.4128,2.5635,1.2269,4.4237,2.8962,0.1102,0.0796,3.1602,2.6241,3.1212,5.5693,3.1095,2.8545,3.8248,0.5413,4.1735,3.4852,0.855,3.102,3.8632,0.1778,0.6608,4.7577,1.0455,1.7716,2.0631,2.309,0.7187,1.891,1.5654,0.8714,0.1807,5.7283,0.0641,0.594,1.5169,4.2254,3.5306,0.6925,1.1344,0.8813,0.9608,2.8272,1.3675,3.8804,0.1573,0.053,0.0215,2.7126,3.0852,6.4161,7.5609,4.9378,1.2265,0.7535,1.2775,2.0194,3.4551,0.0221,3.2742,0.3517,1.0786,2.9055,3.1279,2.7928,2.3205,2.9678,2.3769,0.723,0.2134,3.6745,2.5371,0.4044,2.2093,7.2126,0.0025,0.0671,1.0724]}
{"prompt":"A newly space-faring species makes first contact with a hyper-advanced humanity .","text":"A newly space-faring species makes first contact with a hyper-advanced humanity. A team of scientists are sent to the surface of an icy moon to investigate unexplained natural phenomena. Soon, they discover a terrifying secret about the moon.\nHe found it easy to get a job that had him working long hours, staying awake all night, and getting paid to work in the dark. They were looking for someone who could be there for them. Someone who knew how to drive and could take the kids to school while working, because I can\u2019t do neither, I wasn\u2019t smart enough to have a career, and I can\u2019t read the manual of my new bike. You see, I was always told that I was smarter than everyone else in school. I worked hard, I was on good behavior, and everything was going to be all right. I thought it all the same day I graduated from high school, but things turned out very differently. I didn\u2019t have a job, I was broke, and I didn\u2019t have a car. To top it all off, Mom lost her job. When Dad got her back, he quit, and the divorce didn\u2019t take long. A week later, mom got a call from the school. She was fired for being too late. The job she lost was the last thing on her mind, but soon she didn\u2019t have a paycheck either. Her ex-husband didn\u2019t want to pay child support. She paid rent with what she could scrape together from day to day work. Even Mom didn\u2019t have enough to pay for something as important as health insurance. Mom was a registered nurse, and she worked at a local assisted living facility. We moved back in with our parents two years ago. This is more of a living on mom\u2018s earnings until we can find our own place. There are good days and bad days\u2026 I don\u2019t have much to show for it. I don\u2019t have to work at my job, and my dad took over paying my parents\u2018 bills. But all of this hasn\u2019t helped me get a job. I\u2019m in debt on the car I just bought with my own money. No credit card companies are taking me seriously because of my history with them. They won\u2019t give me a loan either. They may have a better history with me than a bank, but how can I get a car loan if I\u2019m broke? Everyone tells me, you just have to keep working hard and take what you can get, because sooner or later, we all get a hold of what we deserve. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve got a place to live and a roof over my head. But all I can see is a paycheck that doesn\u2019t even cover my utility bills. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just sitting here, not moving toward anything, and nothing really is going to happen.","token_len":617,"entropy":[9.8967,14.2459,1.2959,2.0803,0.0504,4.5245,7.1066,6.7346,3.0992,0.1347,2.0741,9.1003,1.0073,3.4625,0.0138,8.2227,1.2622,3.8003,4.4817,0.3075,1.0888,3.936,5.1498,0.5435,1.7394,3.0771,0.6282,3.7829,2.9413,2.4334,1.5427,1.6217,8.8486,6.8828,0.5207,0.668,5.0718,0.7661,1.2342,1.4053,1.6168,5.9652,3.4361,4.3749,0.9596,4.169,1.5357,2.0309,14.2098,7.6026,2.0027,7.5056,0.2762,3.6939,3.5208,4.6825,4.3801,4.7413,3.2137,2.8412,5.107,0.048,1.7391,7.234,3.7776,2.292,0.245,1.1216,0.8577,3.6709,2.8296,2.3244,2.7354,2.7922,0.9311,3.9768,0.4493,4.7963,2.5489,4.6782,0.2121,3.5048,0.8101,0.9788,3.5559,5.2109,0.9968,0.1672,0.9994,5.3882,0.4736,3.8542,1.5926,0.1137,5.4037,2.1807,3.5333,3.2423,3.8936,4.0153,0.7187,1.3515,5.0064,4.3101,2.9463,4.9379,6.7117,3.6015,14.8354,7.7376,2.6431,3.7432,7.2753,3.1641,2.9752,5.9767,2.5768,0.2804,0.041,6.5029,0.6268,0.2448,3.9849,1.9479,4.2209,3.3739,1.2946,1.0322,4.4351,0.9021,0.0221,0.0004,6.538,2.5709,4.7912,2.8992,2.699,4.6583,8.6434,0.8841,5.5237,3.2727,0.2226,1.5387,1.2442,4.2081,5.1505,0.9084,1.6917,0.9299,3.0161,0.2005,2.4545,0.4282,2.6449,2.7425,1.1851,1.6156,4.9176,1.0412,0.899,2.0531,2.2529,5.2718,5.2715,4.6535,0.5887,0.8651,5.8064,1.6457,1.7435,1.7654,0.4154,5.0113,0.0134,0.5083,1.7501,4.2189,2.8183,4.4344,4.1065,2.3213,6.1809,3.8443,4.4466,1.2965,0.8509,0.0053,1.1998,2.1806,4.8195,2.4985,0.4396,4.5859,0.232,0.545,1.4618,3.4738,1.1208,0.2509,0.0027,2.1542,1.4142,0.9423,1.0396,1.1013,1.7708,6.2813,0.2086,0.6369,0.5016,1.8602,0.0723,0.0254,0.0036,0.7147,1.177,3.3993,0.6394,5.9903,5.0133,0.178,0.7563,0.019,0.0489,8.6317,5.9993,0.5122,0.1778,1.7578,4.3974,5.9079,2.7253,5.6887,2.6354,0.4123,1.6978,5.9752,2.5783,0.6352,3.9721,6.4473,4.4047,0.1708,0.1889,0.0262,4.3783,3.1453,0.6395,4.8726,3.1956,0.5542,0.1523,5.4191,2.7034,1.8149,2.0954,0.4063,1.9303,4.2979,2.8447,1.2254,1.6539,6.64,2.1135,2.0606,2.0901,4.9464,1.828,2.8403,4.5411,2.358,3.3119,0.7327,3.2483,3.6196,1.2639,2.1937,0.3582,0.113,1.8501,2.7503,6.7772,1.6889,5.0377,0.0719,0.0413,0.0037,1.2355,1.5318,5.4365,5.7438,0.3609,3.5621,4.2453,0.3759,0.5588,4.5399,0.0517,0.045,0.0024,2.0985,0.7532,1.8817,6.842,0.0561,1.9387,1.7547,5.975,4.9941,4.9622,5.668,0.6891,2.5723,6.1827,0.1856,2.0073,6.1342,0.7282,0.0218,5.3128,0.7201,5.1981,7.5638,2.3305,0.0827,0.0184,0.0111,1.3232,1.8298,1.8423,1.9068,1.0538,6.8362,3.9325,1.7443,0.0736,6.8993,0.8899,0.4207,4.1948,1.9634,3.8181,7.6192,0.5096,1.0765,0.9804,0.9884,3.2259,2.7358,0.8416,3.0131,8.2223,0.1133,1.12,0.6658,4.9631,4.853,3.9285,1.4839,1.3012,1.8999,1.754,4.7132,0.5475,0.4747,1.1874,4.6527,1.9619,7.0503,2.0864,0.454,5.1942,6.1388,9.7136,3.5235,8.6425,0.4353,5.9456,7.7813,1.8618,4.0931,3.1356,3.9494,0.9567,1.2059,1.2637,4.7071,1.248,6.1224,4.7804,1.1824,0.0686,0.153,5.9507,3.5145,2.4291,0.1117,0.3171,0.0044,3.3546,2.5695,1.3489,3.9887,0.0797,0.7941,0.6104,1.4454,2.3223,0.0454,0.1025,0.0126,0.8639,2.758,3.9018,3.797,2.7504,1.915,1.4583,1.3677,3.0813,3.822,6.3363,3.9284,7.2149,1.7297,5.4134,5.4681,2.4238,5.8273,0.9582,2.8996,5.2931,1.2987,1.1866,5.92,0.2497,0.4802,0.0836,5.1615,1.3277,2.3624,2.6864,0.4648,0.6435,1.081,3.9471,0.0872,0.2628,4.4176,2.7075,5.1358,2.5918,4.4755,2.7904,4.4195,0.6579,4.7971,0.8035,3.3065,0.1724,0.6955,5.496,5.1819,0.4465,6.8351,2.5887,3.7193,3.3069,2.6755,4.2145,1.7192,1.8504,5.8584,3.0155,3.6263,0.5178,3.3644,4.3324,1.7966,0.1085,0.9567,3.2238,0.2759,1.078,2.5845,6.9975,0.5852,2.7635,5.301,2.3902,2.4745,3.7561,8.5293,1.01,0.9674,1.6721,5.1486,2.6844,1.7986,0.2091,6.3161,1.7217,0.6774,2.108,1.0766,3.6187,1.8127,1.9956,0.7961,4.226,0.1054,0.1308,5.8615,0.7011,7.7289,4.2464,0.1118,4.4364,3.4704,3.3711,1.5136,0.0245,4.2305,1.652,1.868,1.5903,3.8823,4.1963,0.1274,1.8601,0.5124,1.8728,3.7728,7.8763,0.0216,0.0011,1.2593,4.4842,2.1794,2.3896,2.9953,7.007,0.028,4.0201,0.3484,6.7836,0.4005,1.5886,1.7996,0.056,0.0596,0.0017,3.1218,2.1576,0.6935,3.0572,0.0824,5.1663,1.26,1.8082,4.6986,0.6323,0.3493,1.8734,0.7389,4.5839,0.273,0.0125,0.0053,0.5998,2.6649,5.1215,1.1317,2.0735,5.7045,0.4635,2.3181,4.1779,2.6828,2.8479,0.1438,0.1651,0.0025,2.8726,1.9763,1.5386,7.1124,0.6204,0.3796,3.0369,3.1502,0.1,0.1033,3.5653,1.7379,4.9163,0.1509,0.867,3.4434,3.783,2.6331,2.5477,4.304,4.4187,7.9704,2.1314,1.7526,1.3148,3.7585,3.5303,3.2374,1.3671,0.1606,1.1488,0.6783]}
{"prompt":"The worst salesman in the world tries to sell you the best thing in the world .","text":"The worst salesman in the world tries to sell you the best thing in the world. I can assure you there are tons of them out there. My job is to stop them from selling you stuff you don\u2019t really need. There are lots of reasons why things are on sale.\nIt happens when they\u2019re sold new. It happens when someone decides they can make more money on it than that item is worth. It happens because they\u2019re on sale. It happens because they\u2019ve gone broke. It happens because they\u2019re trying to clear out stock.\nI hate to say it, but it\u2019s always the price that puts people off buying new items. It doesn\u2019t matter how awesome the item is.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how long they\u2019ve been wanting (or waiting) for their dream purchase. It\u2019s the price that stands in their way.\nI know it sucks sometimes. It sucks at the holidays. It\u2019s especially horrible around here. It sucks at Target. They have the most ridiculous prices around. When they are on sale you can\u2019t believe the value. When they\u2019re not on sale the deal is great. But it\u2019s hard to believe the value when they\u2019re on sale.\nThe best trick is, when you step inside the store (or even the mall) remember, not everyone comes looking to buy a $350. I think the whole idea behind our shopping sprees is to buy the best things at the best prices with as much value in them as we can get.\nFor example, if you walk into the store looking for toys they could put a $250 price tag on it. But they don\u2019t. They put a $100 price tag on it. And they probably can\u2019t get it.\nRemember, you can be the one who saves the sale. You can\u2019t be the one who stops it from happening. Think of it this way, if you\u2019re buying something online with a coupon, you\u2019re saving the sale. Even though there may be free shipping you can be making the sale. You\u2019re saving the money.\nI\u2019ve learned a lot about the best deals by doing the opposite. I\u2019ve learned a lot by using coupons to buy what I\u2019d rather not buy at the checkout line for $2.50. It might be a bit more work each time, but it\u2019s worth it in the long run.\nThe whole point of spending less is to save even more money. Once a person understands that they can make a big difference in the world by just spending less that life becomes much easier and more rewarding. It keeps you motivated and on track.\nMy goal is to help you do just that. To help you find the best deals whenever it may be even better to save money. It\u2019s your money.

{"prompt":"It 's your first day as a travel writer for the 'Lonely Universe ' . They need one paragraph on Earth , pronto .","text":"It's your first day as a travel writer for the 'Lonely Universe '. They need one paragraph on Earth, pronto.The assignment requires the writer to research the science that gives us our'green'planet.\nWe have to give a balanced perspective, emphasizing our importance in the overall scheme of things, right?Your first paragraph is going to feature an entire species of microorganism, the Archaea.Do you know too many things about them?\nNo.'Archaea ': not a real word. But, it's a catchy one!\nIt's part of a much larger group we call'eukaryotes'and which include you and me. Eukaryotes are divided as well into plants, fungi and animals.Some eukaryotes live in soils, water and above the water, while others live in plants, animals or insects, or other kinds of organisms.\nIn a very general sense, an Archaea can be defined as any bacterium, if it survives outside the body of an animal or a plant.So, yes, there are microbes on Earth... and most of us probably don't care about them.\nArchaea make up only a fraction of Earth's biomass, but that fraction is increasing.In fact, the most common bacteria - called Bacteria Firmicutes - make up only about 2 per cent of Earth's biomass.\nHowever, while Archaea are relatively low energy users, they do produce methane, which can be converted into oil and natural gas.That makes them quite important in the global economy.\nBut, what is an Archaea?Archaeal cells are extremely small.Only 100 times as large as some of our cells.We humans have cells that are 300 times as large as some of your Archaea.Many Archaea can be cultured in the laboratory - in simple, artificial environments.\nMany microbes are also known for their remarkable abilities to perform chemical transformations on organic molecules, which are often quite energy inefficient.Such transformations include breaking down sugar, or making a particular chemical substance, which could then be converted into gasoline or fertilisers.\nBut Archaea have other remarkable attributes that have attracted a lot of attention.Archaeal cells have different metabolisms, or ways they get energy from their environment.They have developed one that is thought to be the most energy-efficient way on the planet - transforming methane and making energy out of it.\nArthrospira marina has the highest energy yield of any microorganism, and its energy production has been found to be more environmentally friendly than that of plants.\nThe world is going to get more energy from Archaea and their metabolic products, although the efficiency of the machines they use to power their energy production is still being worked out.\nMicrobes are part of Earth's biosphere.Every day we get more and more energy from them, and they are getting more energy from us.If we don't understand what's going on, that'green planet'we all care about might be less green.","token_len":618,"entropy":[3.0338,6.0687,3.5117,3.0897,3.7858,0.5866,8.6573,2.4524,3.7413,2.3651,7.0321,5.336,3.2687,1.8876,8.8817,11.2171,7.0005,5.5304,6.276,6.8833,4.1653,7.9688,1.9505,13.0279,0.519,0.7025,8.5807,8.3552,5.3243,3.8566,2.2979,0.1629,6.5795,1.3987,5.8955,4.1394,5.3885,1.878,2.4395,11.2802,10.3784,3.2833,6.7215,3.7681,3.8892,8.2063,3.1383,2.0334,5.1622,3.0616,7.5724,2.6153,2.6809,9.1867,3.042,5.3822,2.0372,1.156,5.5415,5.8716,0.281,0.1823,1.4879,7.3641,0.9361,9.0357,2.2901,5.7687,1.5271,3.8015,0.022,7.0991,3.2854,3.9038,5.8051,0.567,5.879,4.3679,0.0253,1.3751,3.5805,9.9489,1.7815,1.1835,8.1192,0.3841,1.5547,8.7521,1.9719,4.39,0.1292,1.7337,0.674,2.4589,4.6441,9.3171,8.4643,3.2296,6.5442,7.8819,6.3945,2.2454,4.8485,5.1622,1.5418,3.965,3.3218,2.9334,0.8088,1.7032,8.8336,3.6363,3.578,1.3505,3.68,0.5151,5.827,0.1917,2.1992,4.6585,0.79,5.6926,5.9015,2.9693,7.0912,7.0828,3.9867,0.2121,0.5658,2.1968,6.9975,7.0196,4.9638,7.0466,1.8989,3.2587,0.7883,6.4179,0.1417,0.0676,0.109,0.8801,7.8944,6.464,5.1378,1.8069,7.3215,0.8658,2.1475,1.0361,2.8158,0.5153,7.2392,2.6797,0.0125,0.0173,0.1232,2.7107,0.7772,6.0876,1.4315,6.1855,0.8262,6.5972,3.2568,2.5964,2.0797,2.0295,0.4216,0.7908,0.5982,5.8297,1.8521,3.3158,1.7762,3.6418,2.8588,2.8807,4.1848,5.2604,0.0852,2.2323,0.3128,1.3133,4.1088,3.5723,5.1399,3.742,0.2462,0.4908,5.2884,5.0489,0.0197,3.7058,0.8538,3.8571,0.1639,2.2256,7.2164,0.0476,1.7389,5.6194,1.5808,4.6055,4.627,1.0557,1.9977,2.4031,2.6694,2.9721,1.7945,2.3807,0.7568,0.6953,6.7059,0.9156,5.7197,0.3313,2.8028,0.4987,4.9801,2.9347,0.9555,5.6646,3.6914,4.9032,0.808,2.5864,4.6135,1.6123,0.0023,3.6315,1.1739,1.2068,0.8045,1.0532,4.0119,0.8368,7.5199,1.2251,3.4956,1.5874,2.6109,0.0185,3.632,0.0706,5.1455,1.1229,1.4631,3.2548,3.324,0.7132,3.1966,1.3033,6.0384,1.6211,0.0883,2.2258,4.0713,2.3832,3.4821,7.2279,3.8886,5.2647,1.0563,11.7249,0.0237,0.0,0.5128,3.7289,0.0406,2.1829,1.6856,2.9015,4.0114,0.0129,0.0573,1.7844,0.0155,1.9603,0.4799,1.1674,5.3965,0.0886,5.2877,4.524,0.0611,1.1973,4.886,5.0297,5.0744,7.7897,0.3482,0.8818,2.4521,4.2251,4.7058,1.4297,1.1494,2.1009,0.4966,2.9994,0.3897,4.8298,1.5586,3.4955,0.0059,0.7352,6.2128,3.4869,0.773,3.9902,4.0792,2.0712,1.1915,3.3049,1.6271,0.6568,0.8414,4.0106,1.7627,3.1738,2.8725,3.8017,1.0142,0.0148,0.9995,8.2659,5.6916,10.1134,6.1313,0.9502,5.5256,1.9216,2.3976,7.612,6.0773,5.2447,1.479,1.474,0.0913,5.7803,1.6901,1.8417,3.3942,1.1022,6.0923,5.5434,1.7174,6.1606,1.4449,0.9152,6.6168,0.3909,1.5264,1.0731,0.8895,3.8231,0.2048,3.683,11.3892,0.0841,1.4555,7.4213,2.6692,0.0821,3.4049,1.5414,5.2319,2.0019,2.1627,1.2622,4.2313,3.1801,6.8872,2.9252,6.9528,3.9889,0.848,1.0872,4.7875,5.1232,1.5543,3.1913,4.6311,3.2776,0.3738,4.8078,3.3491,0.8095,5.4834,3.7081,4.9746,2.8847,4.1932,2.5023,1.913,2.598,2.0629,3.7987,5.4693,5.8181,3.7615,0.2777,7.7635,2.557,3.7691,5.2844,0.37,5.4539,2.0594,4.1778,3.0469,3.5065,5.6445,1.8558,4.7168,2.4155,2.5352,4.5664,2.6862,0.1354,2.7981,0.3651,5.271,1.5081,5.7319,2.4666,0.3149,0.659,3.8286,4.9808,0.0883,2.8734,3.6855,4.1951,6.031,2.8591,4.2554,5.1035,2.8069,0.5792,0.0124,0.5942,0.9362,6.4111,1.9779,0.1258,0.2787,2.4451,5.111,7.3157,0.1008,1.4023,4.3281,6.835,3.7966,4.5815,4.0109,0.6406,2.4338,1.3874,0.4746,3.3056,2.3393,6.3151,6.3927,6.4489,1.1822,5.0707,0.0581,0.6192,2.1234,1.1738,1.7667,2.3725,0.2327,3.3469,7.0486,2.7564,0.1047,3.0218,6.6771,4.3312,3.4839,3.1691,5.0565,4.8594,0.0196,1.1907,0.3287,0.6131,3.3816,7.1368,4.8989,6.3437,9.1631,3.4174,4.8205,3.3648,2.2965,2.0445,5.4341,0.964,0.4042,5.2579,0.2613,0.0213,1.8829,1.7088,3.4073,3.4032,2.5168,3.5884,0.8508,3.8575,0.1426,0.2262,3.9282,6.199,0.3433,0.2745,1.9216,0.1189,4.0462,0.7806,0.693,2.8787,5.9735,2.4135,5.0888,0.6296,2.9656,2.6053,3.2053,1.2432,6.6264,0.1626,3.4127,3.3234,5.5152,4.9239,1.7519,5.703,2.5637,4.7544,0.6972,2.0488,7.4066,3.4755,1.0439,2.7343,5.2982,1.6128,2.8555,1.2402,1.2923,1.9176,2.8149,3.5729,0.63,0.2171,0.5563,7.1113,3.1262,1.4626,5.4487,0.0073,4.2487,0.116,2.8488,0.0174,1.4833,6.7488,2.7211,2.1388,2.9722,2.3614,1.1794,0.0044,3.916,0.271,1.6159,1.1797,1.4666,2.6495,1.4183,3.5168,0.74,1.9606,0.9244,2.8451,0.7628,5.9593,1.089,2.7353,0.0011,5.1806,2.3087,2.3024,0.6672,0.0086,0.7153,5.0052,10.1154,9.4592,1.9768,0.4227,6.5032,4.6574,8.6304,0.2677,5.7173,1.8208,4.5381,4.7457,0.9866]}
{"prompt":"`` You may have spared my death , but do n't take that to mean you have saved my life . ''","text":"`` You may have spared my death, but don't take that to mean you have saved my life. ''\nWang Jian said, '' So I couldn't bring you along? Wang Luqi, you are not too good to my friends. Are you? The first time I found that you are such a person, this meeting is finally over, how about it? You are the same with your people, you really think that the earth is round. How dare it be? '' Wang Luqi said loudly, '' But if you're not afraid, then let's go back together, and you, you can go together. ''\n'' Brother, I know that you did not want to bring me up, but have they brought along any kind of power equipment, to be with their mother? '' Jiang Qianqin said.\nWang Jian said, '' When I first met, I asked them to return to Xi'an to be a guardian spirit, and then I took these people to the north. I used my own ability to find a place with a lot of grass to live. But after a month, he came back and said that when he went north, he went to a high mountain, and he asked me to send him back. Not knowing the current situation here, I decided to send him back to ask for more strength, but it was not until today that I saw it! ''\nJiang Qianqin said, '' Since you said so, then I will not let them go. The first time they came back, at the end of the month, there was a storm. They were trapped in an old wall that was built as a grave. This time, the gate is blocked by a strange stone, and I still think that the two stones are a curse. There are two small stones. The distance between the two stones is small and the size of the stones is not less than the head of a child. You can see the face on the stone. This is very frightening: 'If you dare to die from this stone, only a piece of skin will remain to be buried in this old wall. 'So, I didn't let them go back. When they were in the old wall, they also told me in advance, and told me that today they found the gate blocked. Only if I can get a stone and remove the block, you still have a chance to save them. ''\nJiang Qianqin said, '' This time, I have no way to save them, but this time, I would not refuse so I did everything I had to do, so if I can, my life can be saved? You know they are two children, I still wish I could give them more, but I am afraid it would be no different. ''\nWang Jian said, '' I know it is impossible. I thought your ancestors thought that the earth was round, but now we saw it, the only chance I have to save them now is to find a stone, to remove the stone.

{"prompt":"You have obtained a time machine , but you have been warned that you will age backwards or forwards depending on what time you visit .","text":"You have obtained a time machine, but you have been warned that you will age backwards or forwards depending on what time you visit. Do you travel through time? Travel in time with the future or back to memories of the past? Time travels to a time before the birth of man, to the time of dinosaurs or to the time of humans in pre-history. This is an important question. Can you return to a time machine and change the future and if so, what will we do?. This is a popular and much debated topic of time travel and in the book we explore the possibilities. There is no time machine in this book because nothing can travel back in time, even light speed cannot travel in time, because the very act of taking a time travel trip destroys the very laws of physics. This is a great question because there are many books written that try to answer this very basic question, Time Travel and space travel. What is space travel? Will time travel change history and will you alter the future or will time travel end in disaster\nThe future of the Human race is at risk from a group of scientists and industrialist led by Dr. Donny and Dr. Jane Latham. The scientists are working on an advanced time travel device called the Time Loop. Using these advanced time travel devices the Lathians can time go back to the past and take the lives of the parents of time going back in the past. Will Jane Latham time pass it and alter her future or will the Lathians time travel device destroy the future of humanity. Time travel in this book involves the science of time travel as seen in the movies. Time travel is a science that explores the basic laws of physics that govern the speed of light. Time travel in this book is very much like a movie and will be explained from the point of view of the scientist and engineers who are building the Time Loop. This book contains many scientific mysteries, questions and explanations about time travel and time loops.\nThis entry was posted in Audio Books, Books and tagged Time Travel, Time Traveling Book on January 29, 2021 by David Schulte.\nIn our book The Life of Peter Pan, we explore life in 1930s London in the age of the Great Depression.

The search terms were: foods or beverages OR recommended OR optimal OR dietary intakes OR consumption OR diet OR drinking OR intake OR recommended OR food OR beverage; AND childhood OR infant OR infant OR toddlers OR children OR first year OR second year OR third year. We retrieved the reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of food-related recommendations for children, but only the evidence level of the articles was considered. We included in our review systematic reviews and RCTs of food-related interventions on nutrient intakes of children, and their effects on children. The articles identified are organized as follows: (Table 1) dietary guidelines for consumption of foods and drinks; the recommended amounts of foods and drinks per day for children aged 6-36 months; (Table 2) the intake of recommended\/optimal foods and drinks for children aged 1-3 years; (Table 3) consumption of foods and drinks by children aged 1-3 years. In addition, we have summarized the evidence based on observational and intervention studies in Table 4.\nConclusions: Although it is important to have a variety of foods and drinks in the child\u2019s diet, the recommended amount of nutrients and food groups per day cannot be used as the sole basis for establishing the amounts of foods and drinks in the diet because children grow and their growth requirements change during different stages from infancy to older childhood.\nCold, humid weather is the last thing we need, but it makes the holidays seem extra special.

It really can take on many forms, depending on the weather and the time of year.","token_len":619,"entropy":[7.1211,4.0412,0.7031,0.9814,11.5246,2.2555,7.781,5.3964,2.9663,1.6784,8.4814,4.4093,10.1727,5.5769,1.4089,3.4311,2.8992,3.4209,6.3987,2.4344,0.0527,1.1707,0.8391,2.8433,9.0815,0.086,8.6342,1.0629,5.0901,5.6456,2.6648,5.3498,2.3017,1.3209,2.773,1.317,13.4321,3.1686,3.5193,1.3445,5.7232,2.0245,6.8613,3.0631,6.5525,8.5155,3.236,0.3356,2.3365,1.7183,0.4753,0.2202,4.517,4.339,0.984,0.8838,2.4787,1.1665,6.1197,0.109,2.4646,4.6879,0.0043,6.3698,0.8946,1.083,2.4616,5.0723,4.9819,3.549,1.1033,2.061,1.991,5.4067,1.4832,1.7467,2.2394,1.6949,3.3114,3.1422,6.2232,0.1486,8.0552,3.0998,0.257,2.9578,2.7504,6.3772,4.5535,6.9883,1.3075,3.8157,4.503,4.3375,1.6199,0.5809,1.13,3.9725,3.6533,4.7092,1.2252,2.6099,2.7109,0.2964,4.0689,4.5255,0.2495,2.5824,5.488,3.3215,1.7212,2.2724,1.9242,0.956,4.0962,0.2871,2.1828,3.548,2.6732,2.3109,9.312,1.8199,0.9924,2.6195,2.6638,3.5287,1.2499,4.1062,3.1801,4.2125,3.2001,5.5815,2.4464,7.0845,1.5407,5.7027,0.0456,0.7054,2.1748,0.8387,1.6306,2.4908,3.1791,0.5534,3.4402,1.0974,4.218,2.5651,1.2581,2.2335,4.3344,4.0352,1.5153,2.8956,1.1334,4.3377,4.528,2.1341,0.2247,1.5716,0.4264,6.7712,2.8733,2.3565,0.294,2.9849,11.3464,1.3016,0.158,2.588,2.8811,0.0916,8.4214,2.0796,2.5303,0.1924,2.8102,3.3499,6.2267,0.91,0.9083,9.5145,6.2792,8.0463,6.115,5.1745,1.1909,3.6689,3.8637,0.3682,8.0633,11.4622,4.0841,7.9297,10.2786,2.7647,12.1848,0.1556,3.9996,11.0972,1.2636,8.8674,4.0913,7.3736,0.1898,3.0693,5.6491,1.6859,5.9221,5.7438,5.5033,1.8799,0.9981,0.2997,0.0002,5.0916,3.7461,10.1333,1.7513,1.8876,7.4952,1.2027,6.2004,3.7103,0.8074,9.2118,2.0704,5.7396,0.7579,0.8356,1.9048,1.1218,0.3928,4.4765,1.0491,0.4056,3.3169,1.5914,2.5131,5.8129,1.8641,0.2675,0.2895,0.4696,0.8745,3.4178,0.0548,2.6972,3.2308,2.8472,0.5615,1.5685,0.0048,0.3245,4.361,0.3481,0.0013,3.308,10.1179,4.0449,5.2132,1.4671,0.3898,3.506,0.0453,0.0374,0.4541,4.639,0.1414,1.278,0.5793,2.0108,2.0887,2.8435,1.8725,2.7241,1.5307,1.4101,3.9832,4.1622,0.2853,10.3222,8.1977,5.9243,8.8795,1.8937,4.7953,4.9296,1.0127,4.428,1.8297,4.7777,1.4328,5.5365,0.9016,4.0298,0.5886,4.9198,0.5975,3.768,1.6479,3.3591,6.5045,6.854,7.4808,3.6544,5.2774,0.9637,3.893,1.2173,7.1777,0.3431,2.2967,0.8052,7.1937,2.1304,1.582,3.2893,0.0962,0.7282,1.0876,0.0475,2.2283,1.6647,6.4722,2.4778,6.5187,1.8386,7.3615,0.484,0.1989,2.095,0.3228,0.0026,0.0844,0.1508,1.563,3.0397,4.2241,1.7029,5.2515,1.6853,0.5368,2.4951,5.1234,2.3261,1.6368,5.1848,7.5853,1.9113,1.8045,5.0661,1.1695,1.9538,0.5411,1.442,2.9712,4.8505,1.5997,2.9087,7.8421,0.0557,2.1034,3.8245,0.0081,0.1015,1.7978,1.4598,0.4053,0.044,5.2974,4.9355,8.876,1.9201,4.0699,0.3892,2.0538,2.2261,5.6206,3.232,0.1275,2.2679,2.4048,3.0403,4.7874,5.58,5.7043,6.8644,3.3125,0.3691,0.2863,3.1825,7.5469,0.4418,0.6992,7.6088,2.584,1.0534,7.455,0.6366,1.8103,0.8843,3.3799,3.2873,5.6872,3.6492,4.5827,0.675,2.4329,0.4083,0.3105,3.946,0.5975,2.0023,0.4872,3.4713,2.682,2.7991,8.5401,1.671,0.5946,3.1451,0.2985,0.0713,0.0387,2.843,4.403,0.2941,3.6882,6.7071,3.9206,0.0308,2.3169,0.7488,0.2233,1.5971,0.2249,0.4981,3.2973,0.2295,2.2069,0.1241,0.3525,0.5683,0.0171,0.0024,0.0045,5.2373,0.2114,1.947,0.2494,0.1683,2.7408,1.7612,1.1801,1.3031,0.143,0.8613,0.0529,2.0649,3.6352,1.2857,0.2301,1.2157,4.6176,4.5446,0.7125,2.5196,4.7996,0.1037,4.6961,2.6513,7.0954,0.4143,3.3524,8.231,3.2588,0.622,1.0337,5.4989,0.0198,0.1302,3.9969,3.9092,0.5587,3.0095,0.2524,3.6315,1.7236,4.3367,0.0146,1.4785,0.4124,0.4873,2.2885,1.8079,4.1731,14.6707,8.6179,3.8776,0.5505,0.3051,2.2209,3.2663,2.0338,0.3534,3.6054,2.0032,4.8188,4.4815,2.5436,0.0724,5.4513,0.2709,4.0914,1.269,2.1838,2.3589,1.7392,0.2905,5.5086,1.9447,7.2768,0.4267,2.5147,0.2966,0.2049,3.7566,0.9998,1.9434,5.9339,2.6178,5.5702,2.9674,6.2002,5.7923,7.1719,3.2199,3.8463,5.3889,2.2042,6.7239,3.9182,0.4312,4.4109,5.3303,0.1978,1.7296,11.4734,3.1563,4.7901,3.5587,2.0357,2.7663,6.1426,2.8427,3.2691,1.9027,3.0033,2.9626,1.9396,4.75,2.9952,9.1164,3.2864,5.1424,0.8744,0.6718,4.6662,3.1886,3.5268,5.0404,5.3257,0.1307,1.218,1.7701,2.9088,1.5075,6.4283,2.0346,3.3577,0.1989,4.8277,5.7362,0.8441,8.3496,1.7945,6.6543,0.0762,0.643,4.102,7.0438,1.486,5.6384,0.0454,6.1506,1.1267,8.6913,0.1679,0.7666,3.3316,5.0013,3.7705,3.5555,4.4881,3.4086,1.926,1.5828,3.2367,0.0504,0.6962,3.23,1.6435,0.958,3.0776,0.241,0.7172,0.2765]}

So no. If we have something to hate, we can change the hell system. This is the key...\nIn the middle of an interview, I was asked to elaborate on the topic of anger and its purpose. The simple question: What are your values, your beliefs, things that make you angry, etc.? I answered: \u201cMy values are that I have to take more time for my daughters, my children, my family, than the money would give me.\u201d This is my truth, not because anyone told me this, but because I was raised that way, and my values were instilled from a young age. I was told: \u201cYou owe this money to your family.\u201d Well, guess what, I have a family, and I have paid back what I owe, to the best of my ability. Even so, my values are, and they will stay, that I have to have a house filled with my family, and a retirement account big enough to take care of them, if I have to. In that moment, I experienced my anger, but it was so much more than that. For a long time, I have spent so much time worrying about money and not enough time with my two daughters \u2013 there was no time for them. And so, with one day of no money, even though I still make money, and with two small daughters who rely on me, who love and miss their dad, and their mother who was an only child and is always there supporting them, I have to decide to turn to a different path. What an incredibly difficult decision! I am not willing to compromise my integrity. I have to choose my values very carefully, very consciously. And with that anger, I choose to take more time for my girls. That is worth the money. I am fighting for my truth, no matter what it costs me. I am fighting for who I am, for who I choose to be, and for who I want to be. This is not always easy. It can be very messy \u2013 at times, very painful. But to be honest, that experience of anger has made me realize that anger is a good thing. That is what makes you fight for who you are, what you deserve. I will go on, and let others continue to struggle, whether in money, or life, or love, or other things. This is my truth, and I will choose my truth, no matter what it costs. Sometimes, one must work through anger, to get to your values.\nWe all have a story to tell, and no story is small, no matter how small.

{"prompt":"You are the only magician left in the world . Every spell you cast brings you one step closer to death . Today , you cast your final spell .","text":"You are the only magician left in the world. Every spell you cast brings you one step closer to death. Today, you cast your final spell. Why do you think people get you to perform their tricks? Do you have an answer or shall I guess? Why not tell me your secret? Why not. It's a one off.\nEvery magician has one goal. To be remembered. But are they even remembered when they die? Is it all just in the minds of the people closest to you?\nI watched this two years ago and I loved it. I mean it is not about magic; its about magic and how it affects peoples lives. Great film!\nAn unusual film, which tries several angles to explain how magic works. This is particularly well done. Very good!\nI've seen this film more times than I can say, it's incredible. Very, very, very good and it has just as much meaning for me today as it did when I first watched it in 1989. This is one of my favourite movies from my childhood.\nThis is one of my fave childhood films. It's a very simple movie in how it goes about its plot, but it's so entertaining.\nOne of my favourite movies from my childhood is the one about the Magic Trick! It has just about everything! The magical creatures, the magician, the beautiful woman and the secret ending that is left to you to discover! The movie is perfect...\nWhen you talk about magic and all of the things that has to be involved this is one magic trick I'm going to show everyone! For people with bad back this is not a good trick to do because they can strain themselves with the amount of stuff that you are using.\nA great film, not only of magic and trickery, but also of life and the human condition. A lot of hidden meanings, and of course some funny moments, especially in its final twist.\nI saw this film in theaters and can't begin to describe how much it meant to me as a child and a woman. I now know it has an important message to the world, something even more important than how hard it is to survive on a basic level...\nGreat movie, with lots of tricks. The movie has a nice touch of magic as well. I guess the magic movie in the family\nI have not seen this film but, the casting is very good. I like the acting and the dialogue. Would like to see it.\nI enjoyed this movie a ton. I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know that loves magic and who hasn't seen it yet.\nThis is one of those movies that the kids absolutely love. I think the only problem I would say is that it is a little long for a film with a child story but that is the only thing that I can think off. I like the casting and the story.\nFor adults this movie would be a little corny and the story sounds a little out of place. If you have kids this one's not for them.","token_len":620,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,2.5945,8.5866,4.2434,1.5488,0.731,1.2822,1.2798,6.0973,4.2006,1.9354,0.4448,5.4894,1.1307,5.1315,1.6509,0.0328,0.0636,3.8698,0.5953,7.1859,0.8976,0.9122,5.4354,3.1369,3.2496,0.3346,1.2299,5.7087,2.3011,0.1555,2.6807,5.7,4.4176,7.2719,3.3085,5.5557,6.0821,4.7813,0.7369,4.0959,0.4632,1.8946,3.1488,2.4391,5.4917,8.9509,1.35,5.6578,1.2546,5.0353,3.3802,3.7772,0.828,2.7819,1.508,0.7005,3.7103,1.8027,5.8725,3.5341,0.9709,2.3484,6.3547,4.3698,2.1339,2.7154,9.3461,2.0098,1.7346,3.3646,3.9644,1.0947,2.0718,2.5556,5.2849,0.9361,4.5744,5.9769,2.2379,4.9729,3.8034,2.6864,0.6885,1.4938,0.0887,3.6235,0.9088,4.4943,1.8016,5.7002,1.206,3.6485,0.0678,1.0339,1.6117,7.8987,0.025,1.2247,0.3029,1.9689,2.8158,6.5977,3.4446,7.0562,0.8885,0.0243,2.004,1.3887,5.3008,0.4533,0.2946,1.2486,5.2177,2.3742,3.6589,3.9081,4.0714,3.8597,4.5812,5.3192,0.6825,4.9012,3.641,2.8427,1.0767,3.0239,7.8458,1.7323,0.4136,8.6155,7.2308,5.0919,1.4576,6.4256,7.3014,4.3935,2.4322,4.3657,7.0758,8.1462,5.6624,1.5788,3.091,2.4821,1.0988,0.2284,0.781,3.8772,1.2595,6.9265,4.179,1.2208,1.826,5.5682,2.9468,3.5226,0.6206,2.254,3.2764,2.0081,1.8559,1.297,4.6434,0.8643,0.134,0.216,0.4438,6.2469,1.7943,4.2279,0.9035,6.107,0.5379,4.7445,3.836,0.0246,3.9262,0.1657,0.5595,4.2753,2.3419,3.1406,5.1164,3.735,0.3362,4.4248,1.4509,1.0983,3.8689,0.3206,0.8131,0.3644,1.543,0.2662,1.4707,1.8408,0.2228,3.0036,4.7601,0.2169,4.172,1.0067,2.7877,0.2597,1.7796,2.1794,2.0019,4.7508,3.2613,1.8492,0.5982,1.0775,2.683,0.9549,2.1823,0.143,1.1275,5.9606,0.1424,8.164,0.8981,0.6562,1.5061,1.001,1.9583,2.2821,3.217,2.6391,4.2343,5.5373,1.4436,4.3211,0.9214,2.4718,4.917,1.9847,1.879,1.187,1.2229,2.9648,4.4425,1.2876,1.9624,4.1629,0.4551,1.0863,0.677,2.1068,1.5717,0.6169,0.1085,3.1597,2.7912,2.5877,0.877,1.6055,5.0007,5.4628,5.9267,1.762,3.5186,4.5343,2.4414,0.7713,4.9406,2.5652,5.7292,5.0932,1.5471,0.5632,6.1312,1.0995,0.3091,7.4288,3.5163,2.2348,0.7992,5.595,8.2849,3.4945,2.9844,4.8845,1.7276,1.6755,1.8618,2.7875,2.56,2.9921,2.8901,1.1391,5.5835,7.19,1.6999,5.063,1.5238,5.2598,0.4159,0.8555,2.6221,5.1929,2.3269,1.1392,1.8313,0.9715,8.627,1.3378,1.5331,6.3392,6.7354,0.9994,1.6622,8.2909,0.8106,1.9673,3.3369,2.9379,0.0086,4.5156,7.4632,3.5165,5.7609,4.3728,3.6472,5.6356,5.3548,8.5957,0.38,3.1626,1.8293,2.8018,2.0899,1.727,2.3596,3.7314,3.2918,2.856,10.5407,2.6422,4.0448,2.0613,5.6971,0.013,2.8602,0.8636,2.5127,2.668,4.2631,0.7413,1.6919,3.6138,3.7997,2.9495,2.3739,4.5079,2.1744,5.4037,1.1154,2.6142,5.6718,1.2623,0.7113,0.1118,0.8379,1.0304,3.7996,1.7963,2.6064,4.079,0.9255,0.4227,3.4948,3.5101,0.1115,9.054,3.1078,2.5537,2.8948,4.7243,0.6087,3.3747,4.9582,2.9704,2.8719,4.7187,1.7814,5.6092,3.446,4.5741,0.5089,0.9261,2.0811,4.575,0.4502,0.8481,2.4153,6.5516,2.3921,6.5671,0.8024,6.9596,0.0032,1.7373,0.7132,1.8641,1.8177,4.2263,0.2065,0.057,4.0232,0.1648,1.189,2.7482,2.6604,5.3991,0.3974,1.5483,7.0438,1.3373,3.1469,3.0428,3.5339,2.9064,3.1791,1.8834,4.659,0.7727,1.981,4.6348,5.6065,1.6803,0.5607,0.4843,3.3528,6.4936,0.8743,0.4934,0.2478,6.1338,4.0078,1.9829,5.3313,1.3455,4.521,0.6621,6.2223,1.3921,1.5303,4.2227,3.7162,0.0633,5.6554,1.9622,3.0373,2.8791,2.3581,1.6576,4.3636,4.8179,2.5013,2.8766,3.9031,0.3615,0.779,2.2506,5.2281,2.7292,2.3027,6.596,4.1793,2.0779,6.6354,7.9455,2.0951,3.1311,4.4045,0.5502,0.8771,0.9356,4.3977,4.9309,4.8211,7.4864,1.7345,2.4302,1.2479,0.7408,1.7061,4.0147,1.053,5.2011,1.7658,0.7132,5.0461,1.0823,7.6992,3.4284,0.2434,0.703,2.7407,4.4756,1.126,1.6002,5.0898,0.7489,0.957,2.059,5.1138,1.0212,1.2382,3.8505,1.8105,3.796,3.1885,5.2024,0.2822,0.3071,2.4611,3.7702,0.1856,4.773,3.0847,0.7846,1.9029,4.0795,6.3611,0.0004,1.9596,0.5267,3.3433,0.2055,0.9188,1.9126,0.6301,0.9431,0.1158,2.3354,0.9076,0.5889,5.3301,3.4187,5.8569,0.5075,0.9328,1.8657,2.8034,2.708,4.4165,3.0637,2.3097,5.2534,4.5531,0.4442,0.7884,1.3942,1.5051,2.1795,1.8979,4.3547,2.9424,2.3136,2.8699,3.2298,1.6598,7.8032,5.4732,3.5098,3.1876,1.3532,2.6801,1.91,2.0605,0.8642,1.7188,1.4101,1.4779,7.9563,2.5412,1.9241,3.8774,1.1972,5.5736,1.5137,0.9724,2.8864,1.2351,1.5567,4.7558,4.9921,2.1745,2.4118,3.6773,0.5113,1.2923,3.2008,10.6464,0.0133,2.1249,3.7306,3.4573,6.759,2.0032,0.3519,4.3918,0.0222,0.1826,1.0879,4.1412,0.5655,2.4964,2.6518,3.7713,3.92,4.4669,2.3947,0.5038,2.5243,0.5312]}

They have worked well with my new classes, and had so much fun learning about different cultures. They will be sad to see the animals in the zoo, but we really enjoyed looking at them.\nThe first day my students and I met up after this week of adventure, was for a snack and a quick photo. You can see them enjoying their snacks in the photo here.\nOn Monday, we went to the zoo for lunch, and saw the penguins. The kids liked to touch the penguins, and got some really nice pictures. The teachers had fun taking pictures with their camera phones and checking the photos on our cell phones, too. We also really enjoyed looking at our friends in the zoo, and having a good time together!\nWe left the zoo early on Tuesday, and went to an exhibit about the Indianapolis Zoo. The kids did some great work on their project books using their hands and our voices.","token_len":621,"entropy":[7.3563,0.0009,3.1193,6.6435,4.8637,4.0456,0.0174,1.557,8.0643,2.7427,5.1499,5.9521,13.8377,0.7136,1.7533,1.5314,5.1799,10.8051,5.2646,5.4079,6.4011,0.657,4.021,0.4454,3.3806,0.0124,0.0372,4.6761,12.2059,3.9541,2.7,0.7952,6.8748,2.2789,5.5363,0.5229,3.4367,1.3429,7.4208,8.9047,8.0376,3.1281,5.5369,0.3539,0.9135,2.0227,0.0279,0.0469,2.6994,4.5393,0.1054,1.6324,4.0925,2.7186,0.6274,1.966,1.3042,3.1522,9.688,9.1963,6.6247,5.6008,4.3284,0.0055,0.0428,1.9946,0.3682,0.002,8.6637,0.0122,4.0054,0.0021,0.0145,1.3457,3.718,0.0504,0.0011,0.3117,6.1433,3.3446,3.477,3.185,0.0099,0.0579,5.8331,7.1908,6.021,3.0858,0.0157,0.0768,3.1388,4.6728,2.5951,0.9088,4.3796,0.0119,0.9455,3.6311,0.0051,2.4243,5.1121,2.7984,0.4073,3.1188,10.1351,5.846,6.4624,9.4948,1.8963,0.0044,0.0489,2.7331,3.3524,0.0556,0.9536,0.0166,6.8063,3.2464,1.9054,0.9384,5.9572,7.2183,2.1918,5.0183,10.1717,9.4399,2.8643,2.5878,3.9163,4.3772,5.1166,3.5503,0.4159,0.6509,1.2887,0.0124,0.199,0.038,0.0114,0.3014,5.697,4.4793,1.5149,3.3882,0.5462,0.0468,0.1378,0.0028,0.2432,0.0015,0.0083,6.0089,5.5729,2.012,1.276,2.3667,3.647,1.861,4.6475,4.5328,1.8265,4.6277,2.8484,4.1448,0.0576,5.4547,4.5032,9.5896,7.14,5.0595,5.31,4.8505,4.3448,2.3408,6.9283,3.1562,7.5001,2.99,0.4415,0.8485,7.7733,7.3564,0.0837,0.0812,6.6244,9.0436,5.5995,4.4628,6.13,2.6794,1.1796,2.1164,0.7086,0.113,0.0064,8.933,0.5799,0.2009,0.0122,1.0028,0.2337,0.1275,0.2518,3.3313,0.0048,0.0161,1.9306,3.353,0.0004,0.6762,0.0025,0.0634,0.0369,0.0777,0.1603,7.0325,9.8941,1.9266,0.2,3.5555,1.9281,4.2356,8.1608,1.8209,0.0676,4.686,6.3285,6.6216,2.1098,0.4542,6.542,5.7929,1.3543,6.6196,3.188,0.0577,0.1348,6.3236,1.8723,4.7282,0.8081,2.795,0.1087,0.1002,4.2062,5.6509,2.7184,1.5058,1.5682,5.8771,5.4718,6.088,1.1155,3.2877,0.03,0.049,3.9034,1.7262,1.3944,6.3145,5.6703,0.4796,0.3406,11.0607,4.142,2.7332,0.1837,6.1479,3.2905,2.2575,2.0467,0.0044,0.0175,5.4573,4.7693,0.4394,0.0298,3.5079,4.901,3.8436,1.2361,3.2084,5.4368,3.9209,7.6552,1.9837,1.6623,0.0117,0.0211,1.981,2.2704,2.0031,10.2198,7.0847,2.0203,2.8559,0.462,0.8819,4.0098,3.4663,0.2001,0.2863,3.0065,8.2307,0.5794,3.3967,3.1897,11.4864,5.3104,6.4999,3.7793,2.6538,2.0005,0.3253,0.3704,3.325,6.4386,7.0236,4.895,3.1842,2.6366,1.1478,1.0083,0.0122,0.0284,1.2378,3.7459,0.4192,0.2341,0.0011,0.0237,3.4799,5.5396,4.8808,8.7917,3.3235,4.1309,0.631,1.7728,0.9041,0.0037,0.0191,6.3462,5.0022,4.228,0.3225,0.0237,1.3396,0.7274,4.8506,4.4622,5.9128,7.4732,4.2127,2.1543,6.0031,8.9708,1.926,5.9104,4.1871,1.2078,0.0547,1.4627,3.164,2.1632,2.2617,0.3772,0.8029,0.5698,0.0023,8.4308,0.0024,0.1249,3.7029,4.2921,0.0451,0.3453,2.3503,0.4271,0.954,1.5256,1.0315,0.0175,0.1412,0.4485,0.0015,0.0184,4.4113,4.8897,0.0494,0.0285,3.5787,1.7043,0.0652,0.0115,1.8066,0.9222,0.0067,0.1135,0.3146,14.1396,9.0252,6.7707,5.3565,0.0649,0.0214,0.0478,0.0053,0.0105,0.0103,0.021,0.0005,0.0009,0.0126,0.0005,3.9807,2.6153,0.0211,2.2398,3.8738,0.8139,1.6723,0.4823,7.2214,4.106,10.7022,5.105,1.4151,6.9968,4.6117,2.1907,2.7712,6.844,2.9808,3.4085,3.3718,5.4003,5.2903,1.5207,4.24,4.0144,5.0769,1.5258,1.0342,4.8408,5.1836,0.2086,0.0407,2.8537,1.2695,5.6308,4.8725,2.2091,2.3736,4.2285,0.9072,8.8967,0.4843,1.0038,2.2799,9.5362,3.8399,1.2479,5.7577,1.9763,0.832,2.2631,4.1197,1.0722,6.6014,0.4063,2.1958,1.0464,2.8981,2.8773,3.3081,2.7062,5.4942,1.1941,3.3865,0.1481,3.5182,3.2895,5.6126,6.2344,2.5237,4.8328,9.0609,1.5306,3.8927,5.1161,1.5026,5.2177,2.2104,0.929,4.3553,5.6368,1.9107,6.0879,0.8012,0.8097,3.0044,4.6422,2.1072,4.5469,2.2191,0.5465,2.3219,4.5409,0.8771,1.3991,4.7294,3.1863,1.0529,1.6411,2.3975,0.5242,1.3193,2.7027,1.7631,2.5104,1.6598,0.7897,5.0077,2.2399,5.7883,0.4629,1.4436,2.5094,3.7396,4.1004,2.7664,6.3173,1.1667,0.5881,0.1555,1.0981,0.7143,5.4566,2.6417,4.0746,1.9568,2.1097,1.3268,2.3677,5.9354,3.5236,3.0181,3.2235,0.7699,1.7628,3.6698,6.0282,5.0438,2.0198,6.1311,1.8854,3.2627,3.2759,3.6596,3.9204,0.5564,1.9552,3.8273,0.4436,2.5189,1.9838,5.81,0.3578,4.5049,0.1103,3.7157,3.3859,2.7885,0.3147,1.862,1.0429,1.3855,3.9602,1.3624,2.0844,0.1135,4.859,2.0587,0.6762,2.2346,5.0904,1.3981,0.7665,2.6971,2.6284,1.2645,1.5008,0.643,2.1912,0.723,5.2055,4.4569,4.455,1.9611,12.6114,0.2636,0.7675,1.9745,1.4532,4.8667,3.1861,2.7514,1.958,3.3872,1.5983,4.3852,8.037,7.9264,2.4102,4.8124,1.6317,5.5561,8.9294,0.8412]}
{"prompt":"Your bong is the home of a genie . You spark the bowl and he appears to grant you 3 wishes . You 're both pretty high .","text":"Your bong is the home of a genie. You spark the bowl and he appears to grant you 3 wishes. You're both pretty high. A lot of the time I just put one nectarine into each watered bong, because they are like a cup of pea gravel.\nWe found that the bong water looks very clear and colorless. Even when we light up the bowl for about 30 seconds, nothing unusual happens. There is no smell coming out of it, not even slight smoke. I have to guess that whatever we put the nectarine in the bowl, it melted or the particles are too small to cause anything interesting. I wish it was smoke, but it's not. It just looks the same water as you see in the bowl, when lighting a bowl up.\nWhen it is completely filled with the nectarine, I would say it takes about 10 seconds to get a solid hit out of the bowl. It will not burn on your fingers, but leaves a slight sensation. When you pull down the nectarine out of the bowl, it's just water again. I could taste the stone in the nectarine.\nI am glad that I found this thread. I am in need of a few bong water recipes. I bought a large bong that is almost 6\" x 8.5\" x 8\" but the bottom has some gaps in it, making it difficult to fill up. Since my bong is tall compared to the standard ones, I usually have water dripping all over the sides.\nMy main reason is the taste of the water. At first, I just left it sitting in the bowl and it would stay the same. But then I started taking out some of it to add into other recipes that included nicotine. The results are, the water has a much stronger taste. Even with nicotine. I really want a more interesting water than what I currently have. I tried adding a splash of alcohol but that didn't work out well. It tasted like an alcoholic beverage but much waterier.\nHere is the recipe that I use for my bong water: 1) In the bong, fill up the bowl with normal water and set to rolling. 2) Add in about 1 1\/2 to 3 nectarines, about 3\/4 to 1 tablespoon. 3) Keep on rolling and make sure not to add all at once like that. If you do it like that, you might get the nectarine splashing all over while the water still flows out. When you have a steady stream going, put the nectarines back in but not all at once.\nIt's pretty clear - however, I wanted an option for someone who wanted that'slight' bit of flavor but just wanted a clear water. So the next recipe is for that. Note: For this recipe to work, the bong must be filled at the top, and not be rolled at all while water is in the bowl. If it is, you will probably notice it tastes a tad more 'normal'.","token_len":622,"entropy":[8.0928,4.0627,2.0793,3.6605,7.8939,0.7477,3.1726,9.6561,0.7369,1.5586,3.5261,9.63,4.0551,9.0011,2.5022,6.5405,7.8475,1.8234,9.1456,0.5474,8.7739,3.0986,0.7075,2.1709,3.8812,5.8404,4.9587,5.7082,3.5501,4.9101,3.7018,0.278,2.8172,0.8636,3.3899,2.9891,5.2681,4.5953,9.0519,7.7741,1.0395,2.6567,2.8777,10.9155,3.566,0.0092,1.8716,4.1861,3.3219,2.5215,4.5255,2.3495,6.8508,0.4617,7.9896,1.9473,7.3695,0.8343,2.908,7.7044,6.1532,2.222,2.1236,3.1432,0.2734,6.0863,5.9709,2.9737,4.9476,1.2278,6.9038,1.1,0.6963,5.4316,2.4305,1.4762,6.9642,2.7074,0.8571,1.8968,5.3002,3.8121,2.6417,0.8084,0.704,4.7935,7.2682,0.3,0.2027,4.0147,1.0781,0.9318,3.3301,5.91,1.4063,0.4262,2.1068,1.8353,5.3952,0.4131,7.6197,5.0685,0.7438,2.3343,3.2552,2.2154,6.0059,0.5672,7.1579,4.5951,3.3211,5.641,3.569,0.0167,0.0075,1.3342,2.8855,1.4363,1.9014,0.9218,8.5941,5.4578,5.2323,5.8127,5.1512,3.8961,1.4495,0.523,4.4394,4.0221,5.7638,0.8072,2.2886,5.4597,2.8359,1.1838,6.6235,1.476,0.7519,1.4699,1.3361,0.8654,0.426,2.2191,2.6919,1.6894,5.0012,0.323,7.9587,2.3394,4.0469,3.4059,1.1575,0.6971,2.9923,2.0832,5.922,6.482,4.4547,1.0925,3.8124,1.0259,1.0303,3.9647,3.398,2.8038,3.9682,4.537,0.752,2.0478,1.2621,0.0185,0.0013,0.4263,3.2093,3.9681,1.8235,1.3523,5.01,0.8684,2.5362,1.0707,0.6634,2.7002,2.3136,5.8832,7.5598,4.6452,0.1416,0.9174,0.9643,0.3384,2.0329,3.8004,2.7213,3.3679,4.2708,3.0086,3.5945,1.0782,1.1129,7.6709,0.8168,4.7775,5.4338,2.1019,3.3552,1.4642,5.8782,3.5727,0.603,3.4046,0.0191,0.0009,5.0269,0.5443,0.2017,0.2361,0.3043,0.7837,3.5484,3.4492,4.595,4.8184,0.3814,2.1575,4.3361,5.9825,0.9665,9.3999,2.6377,0.6214,3.4672,0.0215,0.0011,1.7958,1.7603,1.9427,3.236,4.8204,1.3922,1.3261,2.2295,0.8478,6.3638,1.1997,1.0333,2.2992,4.907,3.8543,0.027,1.4551,3.7631,5.1265,0.3787,2.3841,4.9612,1.4755,1.111,5.6835,1.3218,4.6908,3.2432,0.0187,3.2132,2.3502,4.9764,4.4329,2.3137,2.2354,2.0886,3.3094,0.3479,0.5809,2.3549,3.1888,1.3217,4.0575,3.3095,4.6752,3.1606,3.669,4.7402,2.2867,0.6,2.6932,4.7629,0.2951,1.6803,0.1446,3.7544,3.4229,1.1542,5.3937,3.2548,1.3085,0.0541,0.7717,7.7055,7.148,0.0351,1.1518,5.1711,6.0998,0.4501,0.3645,5.764,3.1399,6.9759,6.1484,3.9394,0.1855,0.7889,3.3652,1.4644,2.5776,3.7504,4.1473,4.3564,2.1823,2.8373,4.7029,1.4899,0.5293,1.4426,0.6974,5.5898,0.6798,1.1788,0.4917,3.6901,6.0545,1.2496,4.3674,1.6385,0.3655,1.2532,2.2488,2.6355,3.2167,4.8613,5.1824,0.8064,1.3185,2.3061,3.0134,0.7678,2.9232,4.6332,3.3412,2.3769,1.6551,2.3105,3.3317,2.6636,6.7422,5.2463,3.2534,3.424,6.3739,9.8807,1.0612,2.7493,5.6091,1.4435,5.5362,2.3883,2.024,3.3874,1.044,3.292,2.1562,1.7579,1.4212,5.2503,2.7038,4.0679,5.1758,1.6956,4.5871,3.5094,3.3751,4.0896,5.2565,3.2126,3.6451,3.0135,0.598,5.1593,0.5829,0.5959,1.6058,5.2032,3.2457,1.8469,5.8227,0.0948,5.1901,5.1587,2.5332,1.888,0.0007,0.6985,2.2319,3.7938,0.5966,3.2456,4.9706,1.1879,4.2169,1.9637,1.8595,3.4982,6.2287,7.4429,1.6782,0.7136,1.4451,4.5689,0.6008,1.5922,1.8346,2.6461,0.4074,1.9927,1.5674,1.4377,0.9947,0.0619,1.778,1.6811,5.9072,3.3106,4.5612,1.8072,3.4541,0.0484,1.8399,3.6307,2.3223,1.1079,0.9745,0.4343,9.1256,0.9606,1.9001,4.3294,4.0911,9.1324,1.0651,0.5466,0.0014,3.087,3.5538,4.5027,1.201,3.7665,0.0156,0.1686,4.8698,2.5327,6.9474,3.8869,1.9029,2.4125,3.4506,2.3053,2.7499,0.054,2.0993,2.6788,4.3639,2.118,0.339,0.0019,4.9295,3.3296,0.1285,2.3703,5.2324,0.2707,3.5068,0.0172,2.7182,6.1424,3.9947,0.0316,6.9667,3.9895,0.3711,4.4499,0.3678,2.0223,3.6419,3.992,0.885,0.2662,1.0904,2.6875,2.2191,2.9149,4.343,1.6088,0.0103,7.6099,2.129,2.1432,0.0273,7.5368,1.9986,0.683,4.9127,4.1354,3.1067,0.7631,5.0664,1.0763,2.8923,2.6999,4.8771,1.153,5.3591,1.1459,4.427,1.0888,2.0428,1.3564,0.0549,2.0429,0.542,5.8097,2.0277,2.9295,0.3762,0.0456,0.2236,2.3661,4.2282,1.9091,4.2371,3.5916,9.0027,7.4637,0.6191,2.1154,5.1825,5.3383,6.3028,1.6153,5.8856,0.8236,3.8928,5.1129,8.2094,13.1768,9.4221,6.8171,1.4067,1.6646,4.5228,4.3273,1.0979,1.694,5.3881,2.6735,1.5802,2.611,4.7456,3.2792,4.553,2.027,1.7623,3.4985,0.7538,6.4744,1.8531,4.6523,1.4888,0.975,3.4706,0.2698,0.6222,1.9101,2.6081,0.1085,2.1327,0.5401,1.8876,4.2842,2.8488,2.7259,2.9514,2.8686,2.089,5.5741,5.057,3.6758,2.9237,6.556,4.9191,0.5096,2.5066,0.5906,0.718,0.1206,2.8631,2.6577,0.9227,1.9727,2.1102,1.5799,4.1501,4.0728,3.0693,7.3777,1.9623,4.6796,2.2946,6.7865,5.6376,1.5139]}
{"prompt":"I looked upon what I had made , and I was wrong .","text":"I looked upon what I had made, and I was wrong. The form of this kind of light came from the combination, in the most perfect and harmonious manner, of three elements, and I did more than merely show a general form of light.\nIn this experiment the parts of the picture were so finely and accurately adjusted that to me they formed one harmonious whole, but other people saw a false whole.\nIt was thus that the false and fallacious impressions were produced.\nBut what then were the original elements by which the picture was constructed? The three fundamental elements are light, heat, and air, combined in different proportions and in different ways, and thus produce a variety of colours.\nIn one part of our atmosphere light, heat, and air are of such a combination, by one or the other of the three modes of combination, that they give a particular form of light.\nIn this particular combination there is probably no matter, and for that reason no colour ; but of course light and heat are here the principal elements out of which the picture is composed.\nIn other parts of our atmosphere light, heat, and air have a higher heat ; an intense light appears, which I have termed an \" ultra-luminescent light, \" the third element is the matter, and that matter, I believe, is not only capable of absorbing that extra-atomic light, but also is capable of being made the luminous agent.\nI have known, and I am convinced there are other instances of this, that light can be absorbed in matter, but as yet I do not see what would be the nature of the agency which then makes the matter luminous.\nWhatever may be said regarding the nature of matter in connection with chemistry, it is impossible to overlook that the combination of light with matter is the chief means of producing light in any form.\nAll light has but a mechanical mode of production ; every particle or molecule of matter possesses a certain amount of light potential, and when, as in the case of ultra-luminescent light, the combination is so precise that no other form of light can enter into it, in that combination the light potential is so far developed or raised that when certain conditions are met it explodes with intense light.\nI have seen a small number of beautifully coloured stars in the sky, of which the colour is not due to the absorption of the rays of light by the matter in which they are situated, but by the combination of these rays with an excited atom of air.\nThe light potential is again excited by some other cause of light in the atmosphere ; the combination is so close that the light potential only leaves in its course a very feeble ray of light.\nIt is, however, precisely in this kind of combination, and with the light potential so developed, that the most beautiful colours are seen to appear.\nAll this, of course, is far too simple, for I am conscious that each of the elements in combination has its own laws ; of these I have only touched upon the most important.\n\n","token_len":623,"entropy":[7.7663,7.2452,5.4966,1.668,1.7643,5.1744,2.3241,0.7675,1.9067,2.585,6.964,0.5718,2.7775,8.0701,1.1895,3.3323,5.1987,0.1348,7.7523,5.0307,1.267,1.0598,8.45,5.1363,4.4386,1.9234,5.5405,2.7086,2.5854,5.3271,0.013,1.2825,0.8682,0.7247,4.442,2.6946,1.3565,2.4518,2.0751,3.8603,8.5286,0.6998,6.4954,5.4282,3.6394,5.7029,3.3616,1.4961,1.5951,1.1492,3.073,9.0297,2.448,7.9447,3.3011,7.6005,1.2938,0.7251,6.2118,1.0489,5.1932,4.5711,4.1621,4.029,5.5402,0.8552,5.9673,3.8673,1.4114,5.9395,4.0083,6.513,0.0291,2.2684,1.18,3.6017,7.3903,6.214,3.586,3.2591,6.8272,3.5177,1.3133,2.1974,3.5555,0.8469,4.8259,0.64,2.2121,7.8258,3.0961,10.5235,1.6077,6.2906,2.2821,4.3535,1.7303,1.1333,3.5229,2.6748,4.8275,3.0365,0.9715,6.271,2.1108,6.3706,1.2468,1.2721,3.9864,0.7363,4.1326,0.1263,2.9401,5.0686,5.2958,0.4153,3.2163,3.6612,0.1184,3.3408,0.2863,0.0991,3.0516,1.8729,8.5527,1.9851,6.4847,1.9259,2.4092,1.9819,1.2236,3.1525,1.7986,1.0537,4.6633,6.8619,1.7341,5.2434,0.0463,3.6759,1.0438,0.7355,2.7219,3.9144,3.6081,0.7682,4.9606,6.4812,3.4081,3.5511,1.9229,0.319,0.5056,0.0472,0.8655,5.2774,4.005,1.2024,6.2733,1.9061,7.0048,6.0551,2.6823,3.0148,0.0212,2.3043,1.3235,0.9486,7.8108,0.5069,6.2503,0.573,0.2383,1.698,4.8438,1.7826,5.1599,2.9126,1.9626,0.8962,0.9422,0.8456,0.8588,2.449,3.9269,3.3552,2.9238,0.7325,7.4372,1.268,5.5913,2.6453,3.3816,5.0017,2.6476,0.6457,2.9828,4.0129,10.0313,1.363,4.9737,3.431,3.9325,1.9755,0.3259,0.9563,7.3689,4.6001,4.154,0.9045,8.5883,0.0366,0.0779,0.9206,1.2549,1.0137,3.6606,0.4392,0.3024,2.2661,3.7149,1.7407,0.1944,2.0612,0.1358,2.7443,1.142,0.0243,0.1728,0.2059,0.0047,3.2487,2.8375,4.9375,5.6325,8.4762,7.555,5.9903,3.5011,6.103,1.653,2.278,5.2196,2.3986,4.5692,3.982,3.7004,9.6169,1.0051,4.965,2.2712,0.8273,1.2535,1.518,3.3739,3.1404,4.2772,6.8834,0.9904,5.5965,1.7584,7.3462,2.5006,1.5636,4.2061,4.7879,2.7332,5.5948,2.9689,0.0926,0.8965,4.5083,2.868,7.0242,0.0091,3.5292,5.1805,6.0439,4.2372,6.383,0.8369,0.521,0.1724,1.7747,4.4273,1.2176,0.0258,3.1358,4.237,4.8379,5.9704,0.0653,7.1953,1.7632,0.22,3.1371,1.3349,5.3619,2.3415,1.8635,2.8691,2.0875,2.9787,5.4124,1.2077,2.6941,5.3628,0.7196,1.159,2.2877,2.159,2.5626,4.0204,0.8458,2.4627,2.1386,4.405,1.0166,2.2081,5.3677,4.1046,2.0327,2.0524,0.003,3.4918,3.9,4.3137,0.8866,0.5668,5.5994,0.0701,1.778,9.4735,2.1679,5.8401,4.5248,1.7565,3.138,3.084,0.0024,0.5911,0.411,6.2935,2.7885,0.2451,3.7523,5.9339,0.6203,3.4478,0.0752,2.458,1.9239,6.8373,0.0017,7.341,0.273,1.5281,0.608,4.5204,0.3844,7.3902,2.2509,1.8722,5.5826,0.4038,1.8999,2.8612,2.1671,1.4238,1.938,4.0947,4.4053,0.8071,1.8682,2.8342,2.4511,3.4371,3.2211,0.916,0.4813,4.8798,3.6637,2.4355,7.8802,2.2424,6.566,5.5178,0.879,2.8802,3.0407,5.8728,4.8888,4.8223,2.5879,1.9365,0.8762,4.105,1.2616,3.0812,3.019,0.0183,2.7543,8.8026,0.9883,0.9301,4.0724,5.7102,2.3363,1.72,1.1257,0.5273,0.0129,11.1592,0.095,0.223,0.013,0.0113,0.0735,0.2517,0.102,1.3667,4.9148,2.028,3.718,5.1718,1.8151,2.5807,3.1282,3.2154,0.3516,0.2376,1.0282,4.4202,1.1463,2.2175,0.2065,5.535,3.5902,5.0654,1.4937,1.3004,2.4583,1.4536,2.3845,4.9244,5.6862,6.2352,6.4518,1.4933,5.6206,7.135,1.6898,0.4735,0.7538,2.2057,7.1193,3.7572,6.6178,1.1545,0.8102,0.1922,3.0845,1.0675,2.0167,3.4575,5.4251,1.4233,0.0241,10.0985,2.5656,5.2053,2.0614,1.162,1.4098,0.5605,4.8545,0.5948,1.673,3.6485,1.3067,3.4132,5.6496,0.2053,1.2729,5.7237,0.1143,1.5614,4.8476,0.6931,1.1659,2.4173,0.9336,3.8902,2.331,3.0076,0.4879,0.5524,6.7099,0.5821,0.1624,3.5268,0.5356,4.609,0.1604,2.6436,1.0932,1.119,4.4109,5.1249,6.1886,1.3773,3.1422,0.8832,0.4153,2.0941,3.0713,2.7448,2.0755,8.28,7.2999,0.9844,4.3195,3.2265,4.2913,4.5676,3.6353,4.0263,1.0791,2.6498,2.3161,2.2693,4.4537,2.1672,2.649,4.9629,1.1834,1.5771,1.9772,2.7125,5.692,6.7026,5.4353,2.0617,6.4935,1.8838,3.06,5.0338,7.33,0.6974,0.4733,1.4025,0.2592,2.933,0.5464,3.3767,1.7818,0.0066,5.9753,1.9772,0.9478,4.1673,0.0023,1.7123,1.7105,2.6207,3.7539,1.8001,3.8207,0.9987,0.7922,5.318,0.4621,0.1995,0.8212,5.1843,3.557,2.2761,1.4348,4.398,3.7671,3.0538,1.5477,0.2193,4.5231,1.6352,2.7769,3.0748,0.0256,0.0017,0.9006,6.9844,3.4646,3.0456,2.3828,1.8421,1.7751,2.1391,5.2896,0.9462,6.2561,1.2705,0.9764,2.0603,2.0644,6.8161,2.2235,1.2932,0.5831,5.3528,3.5755,5.8068,1.9621,2.3848,1.0244,2.756,5.7857,0.8371,1.507,2.3829,2.4248,1.0729,6.5455]}
{"prompt":"My roommates painting","text":"My roommates painting on the other wall. I think the girl\u2019s face is particularly striking. I\u2019ve never seen a face this vivid.\nIt seems that an important part of the art school community involved in creating this exhibition is a certain sort of celebrity\/authority. There is someone in particular about the art school who is famous for not liking anything and everything; she is especially proud of not having liked our work. As a friend of mine once said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who to listen to; my girlfriend likes it, and they like it, and one of my roommates likes it. I think I\u2019d get rid of most of it and replace it with something more original.\u201d\nThis image is for this project. It was taken from the top floor of our student loft at Carnegie Mellon University.\nIt seemed fitting that the exhibition would be titled \u201cSomewhere between Good and Bad.\u201d In our art school, and all colleges for that matter, the best work can be bad work and the worst work can be good work. This is not really what I meant, but I have tried to capture what that concept involves. Part of the exhibition is a series of pieces that are not finished, but can be seen with one panel a day. This gives the viewer an idea of how much work there is to go over. The \u201csomewhere between\u201d is a little confusing, but I think we\u2019re trying to convey the idea that there is a way in which we hope to be just a little bit better or to some degree better than the other work. I think the problem is that there isn\u2019t. I know that sometimes I feel that way, though I don\u2019t think I am as bad as my friends think.\nThis image is a small watercolor I chose for the project because, as I was moving pictures around, I came upon this piece hanging on my friend Mark\u2019s studio wall. This was about as bad as the worst work he has ever done. It is a large scale and uses very little color, and the form is not that of a tree, but that of a very tall house. But the use of the \u201cnot\u201d rather than that of \u201cnot-a-tree\u201d suggests something good, even though we can see that the painting is just about as bad as that of the artist\u2019s best work.\nThis image (below) is just over a foot tall. I think that it is a more realistic representation of a tree, if such a thing exists, than anything else I have ever done. The only problem with this picture is that it is very gray and uninteresting. Its color is not very good as well.\nThis is a close-up of a piece about the size of a coffee table. I painted it as I was standing on top of the table that is usually used for work.

{"prompt":"It turns out the entire world is made up of introverts and having realized this no one puts in effort to socialize anymore . You are the lone extrovert , how do you deal with this ?","text":"It turns out the entire world is made up of introverts and having realized this no one puts in effort to socialize anymore. You are the lone extrovert, how do you deal with this? How do you build a strong relationship with an introvert? We help you with the answer in this article.\nIntroverts do not put in effort to socialize because they have nothing to talk about and they spend their time figuring their own mind. But this does not mean they are lonely, there are a lot of introverts who are the king of relationships and make others want to be around them.\nIf your friends want to be with you they will be because you are good at making friends and you give them space. You will make your friends feel comfortable and free to chat about whatever you want. They will even feel good when they know that you like them because in the end the only thing that matters is friendship.\nBeing an extrovert is like being born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you are like a god. You will be the king of popularity, you will be able to do anything and nobody even notices you.\nBut being an introvert is something else, you are the worst at relationships, you do not put in the effort and you can hardly make any friends because you are so boring. So you make sure you are friends with people who share the same interests as you and you have the same values.\nEveryone thinks he makes friends easily, but it is always the introverts who have to put in the effort. The only way to make friends is to be honest with them, ask what they like to talk about and give them spaces that is going to be theirs. At the same time they need to also give space to you.\nYou should work on your relationships as soon as possible because the majority of relationships are built through social life but the same people who are great at socializing are no longer good at relationships. If you want to make the right choices, you need to choose the right partners.\nWe spend so much of our time figuring our own mind when we are dealing with relationships. Introverts are very independent and take their time to work on their relationships. They understand and respect people and they take them into consideration. Therefore they make others think twice before choosing to spend their time in a relationship that will not last long.\nBy having an introvert as a friend you can be sure that your relationship will last forever. They have a lot of things to offer and they will not let you down. They are reliable persons who are very good friends. They are nice and kind.\nAnother great thing about them is that they are not difficult to get along with.

We have a conversation and you ask me:","token_len":625,"entropy":[6.1525,2.6362,0.7944,2.0917,4.544,1.1168,15.8727,3.0784,1.471,1.5912,8.9734,2.8373,8.2239,6.0861,1.6776,0.677,0.8286,6.6491,1.3869,3.4755,11.0976,0.2399,0.2459,8.9021,0.0179,0.4029,1.7013,4.6572,1.269,1.8446,5.8302,3.4394,0.2911,4.4716,0.3629,1.5825,7.0145,1.6027,7.0744,1.3944,1.4646,1.0856,1.408,1.3088,2.598,4.1814,2.4979,2.5404,1.3899,3.8082,2.7068,1.861,3.316,5.5119,3.7186,2.1236,5.7135,1.7189,2.7218,8.1453,1.7919,4.1875,4.4602,5.629,3.1591,1.5423,5.1275,0.8126,1.1873,2.5707,1.1732,2.0452,3.2253,1.3034,3.8402,3.6761,4.0818,1.2788,5.5451,2.308,0.1973,1.3419,1.7752,3.196,5.6109,0.7474,9.8841,0.9521,4.1078,4.5128,0.7038,4.8978,3.6392,7.4674,1.4701,10.0827,1.7673,3.5352,2.3009,0.9658,2.1582,3.5581,0.9451,5.9048,3.5269,2.2657,5.2233,2.0279,1.9703,1.5289,1.1011,2.1702,3.504,6.4744,4.9394,3.4837,2.4939,1.4261,6.236,4.3134,1.3542,2.0303,3.5714,1.4267,5.576,1.6084,1.0561,1.158,1.1639,2.0514,0.718,8.0787,0.3659,1.5835,2.8522,1.9527,3.2217,4.8807,4.362,0.3149,9.3925,0.3672,1.643,3.4961,5.5454,0.6628,0.0165,1.3395,0.633,2.7481,2.7759,2.1328,2.4995,3.0508,6.8998,2.665,1.2634,8.3976,6.2499,1.0715,1.492,2.7768,1.0267,5.6965,2.3919,3.3971,2.6311,2.1396,0.8278,3.9336,0.1584,5.353,1.1599,4.987,4.8905,7.4963,5.2471,5.3795,0.4622,0.8469,2.23,1.2471,2.6354,2.1647,1.4599,0.9137,4.6446,1.4607,3.6148,0.9173,1.3733,1.5516,4.4699,2.5843,5.1319,1.8658,2.93,0.6332,4.118,0.0165,0.5206,1.0974,3.8781,4.647,4.8079,4.4029,0.8219,0.8801,5.8242,1.6871,1.626,7.2465,3.4101,2.2889,6.331,1.7258,0.1814,1.1202,3.8337,2.0922,3.6288,1.8799,3.9843,2.4875,0.8466,4.4866,3.0478,0.6905,3.1685,6.2084,3.8961,8.4405,2.2999,1.1214,5.9009,1.5269,4.1749,0.4552,1.7348,0.4257,2.2284,0.1199,1.6474,2.4642,2.222,7.0798,4.4678,0.3926,3.5822,3.6638,2.8277,1.7344,5.8311,1.7423,0.0021,0.2287,1.2832,1.7925,2.9424,2.3038,3.5267,3.8528,2.4742,4.8047,0.3676,1.365,3.9421,1.3875,2.2549,5.4032,0.789,1.4132,1.6905,1.3409,2.5731,5.9682,0.8303,6.195,5.3952,0.0608,1.0201,1.6,4.3049,0.0436,0.1977,4.2716,4.8563,5.25,0.0367,0.1661,0.5257,1.2234,1.6029,1.5563,3.979,2.0125,3.4741,6.2043,3.6516,5.6873,1.007,1.3982,6.8223,2.5049,1.6767,4.502,4.2265,4.9323,3.009,2.7958,4.2569,4.6175,1.6524,3.6418,1.4756,5.6162,2.351,3.3538,2.8723,1.7811,3.6875,4.6205,1.3618,3.6474,3.3038,2.783,8.323,0.5946,1.0781,5.459,1.1101,0.6945,3.6565,1.0906,1.1557,2.9577,2.1752,6.5213,2.0392,2.583,1.792,2.8354,3.7052,9.0786,2.3517,1.7211,5.3332,4.8538,0.2142,4.0401,1.619,4.8039,0.5161,2.4128,1.437,2.5469,3.326,6.7806,0.8069,2.4197,1.0651,2.9331,2.7807,4.5494,2.3833,0.4046,6.6222,3.1551,0.3226,3.0226,5.8045,0.6545,4.7783,2.0843,0.7926,0.4821,1.966,4.0844,6.3607,2.1807,3.2681,2.4738,3.4225,2.0489,2.0285,2.0777,2.4659,6.5545,0.6163,4.333,1.2565,0.4873,6.2074,0.0129,5.1632,0.995,2.3002,0.0987,0.2706,1.5873,2.9416,2.9111,1.2535,3.6163,4.176,1.4113,2.8196,1.3486,6.6192,4.1907,4.3417,1.8229,0.7307,1.1263,1.0731,2.4704,3.1622,1.7224,1.1288,5.7237,1.624,1.0908,0.7781,1.5081,3.1421,4.757,1.7928,1.8914,2.2567,3.2892,3.1126,4.2299,4.2324,3.0754,0.4002,0.7014,7.4654,1.9955,1.7155,4.8182,1.5613,4.0938,6.5922,6.9444,4.3322,4.9552,2.5399,0.3304,1.4136,4.6487,0.5085,3.9139,1.9012,4.0385,3.1164,1.1041,1.1059,1.2208,3.9659,0.5622,2.7455,0.3563,2.9828,0.8952,0.0628,5.0694,0.556,2.1468,1.1262,1.349,0.8369,4.1934,5.1793,4.1295,0.8942,1.9619,4.3014,3.1857,3.2757,1.0717,1.9025,2.5531,1.5951,1.9454,2.3327,3.0486,2.7727,0.9511,4.121,0.7013,4.738,0.7576,1.414,4.2657,0.1102,1.2884,0.6144,0.3446,2.0148,0.3626,2.7494,4.2099,2.5705,4.2237,4.4056,1.9051,3.425,5.6119,6.4412,0.7985,7.1726,1.5807,2.088,2.591,4.7404,2.7447,2.5871,0.8367,1.4028,3.9631,1.8435,3.3507,6.3794,4.3905,2.9512,4.0794,1.7096,2.7675,1.9743,3.9112,0.4278,1.353,4.5228,0.8488,4.2315,2.9781,3.2947,2.8193,0.9492,5.6159,1.7099,2.3079,2.9602,2.6188,1.2191,4.6538,2.9127,2.459,6.3671,4.1885,1.4682,2.412,2.6205,3.8339,1.7799,3.0224,2.6302,4.6823,0.9922,3.0576,0.4681,4.02,2.1784,2.8336,0.1131,0.9621,1.1822,0.2339,4.5552,4.7487,0.8913,1.5143,4.6042,2.4548,0.3318,4.6046,1.9906,2.7945,3.4525,1.5169,5.7576,2.9426,1.0875,5.0699,1.1124,1.6073,2.8244,4.5224,2.3187,4.3603,4.8115,3.7695,1.0615,2.929,1.1434,3.7677,0.3469,4.4048,2.6554,4.6552,2.3186,2.555,2.2514,2.6439,0.5394,1.288,1.3495,1.3961,5.7651,2.1168,0.416,4.9319,1.6647,2.7496,0.8305,3.6121,2.6775,1.2194,4.8126,1.4139,2.2213,3.5522,1.0921,6.9295]}
{"prompt":"You are one of the voices inside a mentally ill person 's head . Tell us your side of the story .","text":"You are one of the voices inside a mentally ill person's head. Tell us your side of the story. And if you think psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Harris of Columbia University Psychiatric Institute has done something wrong or is a crook, you should report it to him.\nI know his history, and it makes for a very bad combination. I suspect he was at fault in his treatment of me, but when I reported the abuse to him, he tried to justify the abuse and then gave his side of the story, too. I just thought you and Dr. Harris should know my story.\nIn the end, I am glad I decided to contact the police for my help. I still have the tape, but now I am afraid I might not have the courage to use it.\nBut there could have been a lot worse. So I suppose I just learned to live with the loss of this part of my life.\nThe following are links that I was given by my therapist and I use here for reference. I read them everyday. And I am so grateful for what they taught me about myself and others.\nI love these articles because they are so clear. They were written by someone who is in the field right now. I have had many people tell me that my book explains better than all the courses they have taken.\nI am sorry that I cannot answer all your questions, but I have been blessed with a wonderful life. I have learned to live with the loss of my daughter and my son, but I have found love again and that is what helps.\nMany years ago I found a book my mother wrote for my sister, too, and that helped to keep my sister on the rails.\nYes, my sister died of an illness of the brain a few years after she left the house, when I was an infant.\nI am going to get back to you on your letter. I am still trying to get to all of my emails. Thank you for sending your book to me. I have been trying to get a copy, but every time I go to read the book, the publisher has already gone out of business. I don't blame them. They only live at the expense of our children.\nAs far as the children you are talking about, the one that you wrote of in your book is alive. She died in May, of cancer. I don't believe she ever found out what was going on in her house. She didn't know what her father had done to her mother, and so she also did not know what her mother had done to her.\nI wonder if that girl is reading this post. I hope so. She is the one who inspired me to write my book.\nI have learned a lot from everyone, and I hope to continue to do so. The people who have helped me are truly wonderful because they are always available.\nI still do not understand why God allows all of this to happen, but I have been very blessed with the knowledge that other people have had it easier, and so my heart aches for them.","token_len":627,"entropy":[3.8828,5.5276,0.2885,0.6749,7.8964,5.7181,3.6435,9.8783,1.0062,1.1385,1.1895,0.2926,1.2746,6.5472,2.0153,2.6591,5.736,0.134,0.2461,0.0222,1.3695,4.3823,2.0468,0.5638,3.2086,12.2035,3.6194,0.0915,4.7715,5.6437,5.2832,3.6836,0.3917,10.0238,0.8577,1.9252,2.4777,3.1457,0.9668,3.1948,2.3784,3.8733,6.2141,0.0328,0.4923,3.2535,1.2504,4.1214,0.198,0.5182,2.0594,0.8105,1.0965,10.0981,3.3748,6.0631,5.5675,1.8946,1.4872,3.6116,4.9252,4.1279,1.0922,2.2772,4.897,7.713,0.7023,2.0285,5.5095,1.0949,2.8035,4.4907,6.1142,2.787,2.8893,3.5004,1.661,3.5793,1.8526,2.2222,5.0306,1.2407,4.1578,2.7534,3.3751,0.9589,0.7458,0.5813,0.4785,4.9478,0.0906,3.9977,2.3922,1.1325,2.5877,3.4486,5.3158,3.5505,2.2733,0.2097,0.1511,0.0262,2.4792,4.6006,0.1973,2.0219,4.7983,3.5839,5.0996,4.7715,2.6733,0.0153,0.2083,1.9121,2.8681,6.7467,1.2316,0.8965,0.8522,4.1918,1.8601,2.1072,0.1804,1.2067,3.2183,2.661,1.5726,5.2492,0.1385,5.8692,2.3102,3.3977,3.9633,2.6695,4.8485,0.6147,1.256,5.4495,1.314,3.6149,3.8101,1.7933,0.8982,4.0641,0.641,1.7753,3.8113,1.7436,3.0416,1.9411,2.3114,1.1116,1.4179,0.1138,6.0986,0.1172,1.0212,1.2176,4.4252,4.0525,6.1558,2.0965,0.0249,1.5029,2.4617,1.275,0.5182,5.195,1.0151,8.133,0.9726,4.4177,6.6617,2.3351,2.7839,0.2506,1.9781,4.878,0.5737,4.3157,5.7344,0.0649,0.4371,0.8048,0.4531,0.9801,3.3577,4.5203,3.0046,4.5209,3.8236,1.7209,4.8322,2.8416,2.0714,2.3536,3.1693,2.8063,3.4015,5.3881,3.5152,2.382,2.7075,0.9201,2.1979,5.9956,1.42,8.207,1.6783,4.2328,1.3859,2.5667,3.5093,1.0848,1.0104,3.9263,1.2631,4.295,0.0292,2.3138,3.537,1.1282,4.2681,0.6889,0.8924,1.8182,5.0438,4.4535,4.5621,2.6017,0.4548,2.0399,1.4809,4.2485,2.0066,1.951,4.88,1.8523,0.9569,3.2795,0.3952,2.4417,3.4425,1.9191,3.5633,5.5617,0.0096,1.194,1.8427,2.7103,3.5668,2.5067,2.933,1.4464,0.0366,1.3317,4.1566,4.0395,7.7064,6.5287,0.7193,5.8964,0.975,9.523,2.8522,0.9499,0.9899,1.1538,2.0609,1.3603,2.0758,3.7835,1.9291,0.8235,3.2724,4.4201,1.2808,1.8498,0.0365,2.0252,0.4179,0.644,2.5914,2.4542,5.4566,1.226,1.9611,2.4477,2.0564,1.0139,1.0335,1.7481,3.0118,1.9733,1.436,0.4184,1.2529,0.4668,0.0878,1.3866,5.6724,1.7023,1.6624,1.8923,1.5455,3.393,0.7232,1.8363,4.0045,4.5562,4.5459,2.3656,4.4903,0.7821,1.7568,5.0929,2.5882,0.8967,4.9903,2.7229,0.0679,1.2834,3.5877,1.5896,1.7917,7.3239,2.9057,1.7505,2.5617,2.7564,3.2845,1.8379,7.1603,1.6082,1.5436,2.9771,3.6493,3.3551,3.6339,2.3867,4.1772,4.3582,1.7111,7.5781,0.6959,1.9629,5.8478,0.1294,2.9856,1.9572,3.3981,2.1749,3.4274,2.4902,3.8804,2.3183,2.3165,4.5027,0.4895,0.3303,4.0537,2.2828,3.3414,2.097,2.5447,2.0667,4.3082,1.2663,0.2856,5.2616,0.5248,0.2898,2.1233,1.6352,2.1174,4.7513,0.1397,4.5822,1.9917,0.2068,2.1151,2.8353,4.8636,5.3939,1.5856,1.482,1.8625,3.9767,2.6508,0.054,2.1598,2.3114,4.9573,1.3112,2.7345,4.8035,1.3454,4.0484,0.0121,1.1352,4.5236,3.9976,3.4623,1.4717,0.231,0.4761,1.4831,2.6913,1.9486,3.0161,0.311,1.5944,3.2059,1.6608,2.8722,0.611,6.2993,0.6018,0.2143,3.5987,0.7672,5.3225,3.4681,0.8203,0.9885,2.9385,5.9545,3.3293,4.4682,4.321,2.4071,0.1668,0.3402,0.4154,1.4659,3.4757,0.0012,6.7066,0.4127,1.0933,2.2447,5.0449,8.2657,6.4983,0.9544,1.2432,0.0041,5.1497,1.7969,0.5827,0.813,4.49,2.7057,0.0076,2.3064,4.706,6.3077,1.9222,1.7811,0.1366,0.2372,3.2176,3.6754,1.7545,2.4607,3.9859,6.1031,3.5703,0.9104,0.4855,1.392,6.8394,1.3039,4.0506,2.1015,1.9485,4.7294,2.1469,4.3501,2.4832,0.7539,2.0663,2.8493,0.0013,3.7989,1.6331,3.1908,5.7509,1.3678,2.0745,1.5388,0.7386,0.0419,2.0341,0.3943,5.6042,0.785,1.9547,3.3355,0.0005,1.9443,1.3172,3.6004,3.3929,1.8197,0.4408,1.0826,0.1687,5.6382,1.5681,1.7101,3.5929,1.1132,7.2906,3.0743,0.0785,0.1977,0.6444,1.9461,1.7742,1.0799,0.1555,0.1673,0.32,0.9922,1.0078,1.6576,5.9202,0.9005,3.5727,5.7863,2.6012,7.0636,1.5115,6.2201,2.4736,1.5555,2.8043,1.6897,0.2269,2.7629,1.3003,3.4412,1.2113,0.8614,6.1643,0.5199,0.4188,0.6469,2.9738,0.2538,0.4405,1.4403,1.5294,2.4617,4.1781,1.7898,0.2152,1.2826,7.4342,3.5731,1.1793,0.791,1.8873,2.2721,1.6104,1.0551,1.7875,0.1659,0.3587,3.9677,3.3421,0.7691,1.9002,1.3432,0.1614,3.0512,4.3786,2.3645,7.1321,0.7364,1.4661,4.0807,6.1523,1.1771,1.467,1.3793,5.1267,3.5969,0.3182,2.6551,1.1851,6.9866,4.6267,4.4318,0.7785,2.1037,0.4744,0.2273,2.0709,1.2662,0.8925,2.4155,2.3275,4.5799,2.1274,1.9411,2.1266,2.6689,0.6206,6.1498,0.1697,1.7632,3.3479,4.4954,4.8434,2.3846,1.2354,4.2194,4.2015,5.1175,5.1849,0.0569,0.6755,1.3852,0.4567]}

You eventually remember you have your iPad in your book bag. It has % 12 remaining battery life. At the same moment, you read on your book that the entire country is now moving forward from 1880 to 1910. What are you going to do? Go back in time, or stay and discover what has been written about the future after all?\n[ Solutions ]\ni) No, you can not stay. You need to go back in time. Your task will involve taking advantage of the new technological gadgets available in 1989 at the time when you were born, and what you do not have at the moment, but what is available in the future. In order to do this, you will need to gather information from multiple sources. It is worth mentioning, before you start your research, that the new technology is at a much earlier stage then you think, and only a few of the new technological gadgets are around. In order for you to know more about specific technological gadgets that you can or cannot use, you will need to search for them on several sites which discuss modern technology in the future. When you have found, and read every possible technology, you need to understand how to use it ; you can learn how to operate the computer to complete the task. Also, you need to learn more about electricity. You need to know what the new technology is made of, and how it works. You need to find out what are the effects of a certain technological gadget, and then you can test your findings. You need to read up on new technology, and understand in detail its features in order to learn how to operate the technology and work out how it should be used. Remember that, in order for you to get information you need to take into account information obtained from multiple sources. You need to take into account the information obtained from newspapers, magazines, books, science and technology documentaries and so on.\nii) You can stay. All you need to do is take a trip to the future. When you are there, you will be able to observe all the technological gadgets and things which have changed since the time you left the train. Observe how they are made, what they have, how they work, and so on. You will not only realize how wonderful the future is, but also how much you can have done without the new technological gadgets, if you understood how technology has developed over the years. However, do remember that the future, which you have left the train in the train station, is not the same as the real future. You have to be very careful when interpreting information which is relevant to information that you have observed in the future, as they may not match up to what is true later. Therefore, think carefully about the information that you get and try to make sure it is accurate enough. You can even make a note of changes which you noticed in technology, such as different gadgets, or the way they function, so you know what technology changed since you left the train.","token_len":628,"entropy":[12.3319,7.5136,4.2614,6.9038,10.535,4.0455,0.5287,4.4293,2.0985,1.4852,6.7145,6.8558,1.7532,2.3677,7.1647,2.9714,3.561,1.741,2.1309,0.0116,1.658,8.0495,0.6506,2.5003,7.1443,6.1584,3.4044,2.8584,7.1198,9.1316,2.3494,0.4127,9.0196,3.2028,1.3221,3.2136,3.2662,12.2778,7.4951,8.3899,7.8894,2.0924,1.0846,5.363,2.0323,2.4141,3.8356,0.4952,0.8303,4.6045,5.3051,1.8682,5.9376,4.8659,1.9914,5.3893,4.6046,0.9738,3.4314,5.4328,3.5923,5.6878,5.8752,0.7577,3.4201,0.46,3.9905,3.5985,0.6845,1.6606,0.0209,0.0566,1.1686,4.3484,1.2656,1.2746,0.0279,2.3644,3.2809,5.2619,5.7398,6.3379,2.0056,4.0543,2.7097,4.8729,1.0365,1.7533,3.5046,7.019,3.0607,3.0787,2.5361,6.3407,11.3053,1.2303,4.7927,9.23,5.9417,6.0162,2.5538,2.006,2.1385,3.1568,4.9811,2.9577,1.9462,3.2123,0.2196,2.0971,0.4836,0.5303,0.0248,1.1596,4.5983,6.2923,3.3529,5.1101,4.7401,5.4536,0.0052,1.1644,3.5774,4.2771,5.9578,2.854,1.7943,7.2097,5.4895,0.7088,1.9977,4.3552,1.7992,0.8712,3.9299,2.4696,1.2653,5.209,1.1506,4.0183,4.0408,2.0844,4.0912,1.1081,1.6339,3.0554,2.223,4.2917,2.6065,1.1696,2.1407,1.5529,0.6782,0.5575,3.8109,2.5353,0.1085,1.6923,0.3744,0.1705,0.2171,1.9148,0.4263,0.3675,6.0149,1.9923,1.861,5.0558,0.1371,1.371,4.0232,0.5826,5.3308,2.2209,2.9723,4.8654,0.8079,1.9667,3.0582,2.4063,0.314,0.1464,2.0471,4.4546,1.3025,2.2327,5.6393,2.7614,3.4482,2.5356,1.0882,6.7078,2.9856,2.6071,1.9432,0.947,5.56,2.4252,0.8899,3.4567,0.8902,3.5073,4.3309,0.5735,1.4787,6.4291,1.4253,3.1917,1.1017,2.6482,0.7962,0.0483,3.1541,3.5064,0.3812,6.53,2.8033,1.253,3.0115,1.8472,2.3671,7.3776,1.8378,0.9117,0.5207,0.663,1.0438,0.2724,0.1196,4.5083,1.394,2.0903,2.2107,4.7512,2.8417,4.9715,6.7802,6.2969,1.1773,2.2021,2.3245,3.9854,0.335,4.9809,0.3349,2.6676,2.453,5.2567,3.6304,3.7477,6.5905,3.8455,3.2806,1.6378,0.5601,4.0146,0.1103,4.9404,2.3429,2.1579,0.8255,0.8249,10.897,3.347,2.6555,3.3953,2.2089,0.1065,5.5582,2.3012,2.5344,4.4322,5.5178,2.2008,0.6848,1.4486,4.8733,0.2519,0.8654,1.0571,0.0651,2.9321,4.16,0.0548,8.8708,1.9988,2.3652,1.6305,0.103,1.5853,2.8808,2.352,3.7288,1.2033,0.8752,5.8031,0.2162,1.132,0.902,1.0869,0.8739,1.6858,0.5212,1.8863,1.1812,0.0721,3.7351,0.7912,1.6089,4.6458,0.3208,5.3856,0.4675,4.3681,1.5024,4.4996,2.2647,1.864,0.4931,3.4522,2.2048,2.0684,5.2204,3.0356,6.0322,1.2245,1.9606,1.0604,0.0746,3.1627,4.5913,0.1691,4.8054,2.2532,1.3703,0.6125,4.0327,6.3126,1.4946,3.8972,5.1292,4.0224,1.1655,0.0405,3.5816,1.5757,0.6182,3.0673,1.3569,5.2443,3.6647,5.5994,2.5631,1.4277,1.7217,3.8374,1.1795,0.3053,0.3687,6.0517,1.1284,3.7072,2.2846,0.1828,1.9975,0.408,0.0175,3.3003,3.8568,4.1621,0.5174,0.1001,4.7061,3.5266,0.4302,4.7778,4.1358,0.7423,2.5176,0.0423,0.9035,2.1648,1.2491,0.0933,3.5081,1.0629,0.0664,1.3143,3.7065,2.3757,0.462,6.6437,0.7204,0.8922,0.1444,2.5156,0.2023,6.877,2.8078,1.4738,8.29,2.5273,4.1959,0.1959,0.4429,2.3597,4.7669,0.0113,1.8155,2.4298,5.3755,1.9746,4.7754,1.2973,0.5375,0.3262,0.1718,0.2101,3.2704,2.2788,2.8879,0.8544,0.9629,0.8381,1.2615,4.0523,0.184,2.0284,3.9259,0.1554,0.7039,0.642,1.8341,1.4889,0.0071,4.6357,3.5782,0.6934,2.3692,2.4757,2.5866,5.3356,2.7184,1.6793,3.4184,1.8343,1.1269,2.5177,1.4264,4.5958,1.9301,3.3703,0.5239,8.5768,0.6571,3.114,1.2961,1.8093,4.2296,0.6198,2.5789,0.9981,2.7198,4.1369,1.5885,0.1911,1.1273,0.2923,0.9846,1.5456,0.0554,0.1342,1.5613,0.6585,3.6728,1.2983,5.7412,1.9831,5.985,1.6685,1.6305,1.3069,0.4107,0.3056,0.9088,1.1665,2.069,1.289,1.6725,4.8389,3.4255,6.0103,2.7482,3.6333,2.5549,0.1209,2.5257,4.0579,0.4648,9.4119,2.0366,3.6784,3.3696,4.7834,2.8492,0.6922,1.3101,0.4245,5.3559,0.023,4.9712,4.5365,0.3507,2.375,1.5344,4.4762,3.5245,1.2993,1.9392,3.5334,6.1673,0.3325,2.4084,3.425,4.8582,2.263,0.45,0.923,1.3686,1.8874,1.8009,0.2387,0.5457,6.1101,1.2457,0.8735,1.8762,2.1343,1.3547,3.2904,3.6663,0.4198,2.8727,6.2761,3.2493,3.2182,1.4834,6.0614,0.3584,7.5405,2.4304,0.9008,1.337,6.5901,1.7727,0.5828,2.3394,1.9185,2.4662,3.8269,1.3952,1.8115,5.0585,1.0826,1.4403,1.1243,2.3651,3.9352,5.9614,0.9308,4.0874,0.0472,6.2498,1.0042,0.6562,1.8751,2.4029,2.1684,0.126,4.6976,3.8534,3.8345,0.1802,3.0461,1.3336,2.1633,0.6867,1.8901,5.6206,2.1314,2.6043,1.9513,4.2599,3.3403,1.9753,4.7839,0.4391,6.7805,2.3923,1.3541,5.6711,0.9322,8.7147,1.7254,2.3233,0.0072,5.8331,5.9686,1.6813,2.274,3.2205,3.6198,1.3191,3.3152,1.7808,3.1995,1.7132,2.6071,1.0023,5.9236,5.2861,4.9953,1.343,0.2593,0.3033,0.024,0.6468]}
{"prompt":"DC Comics introduces its newest superhero . This character was seemingly created for the sole purpose of offending as many readers as possible .","text":"DC Comics introduces its newest superhero. This character was seemingly created for the sole purpose of offending as many readers as possible. Now the creator and author of the comic, Garth Ennis, has revealed that he hadn\u2019t anticipated the reception his character would receive. The New Jersey-native is credited with creating the comic\u2019s most popular series \u2013 \u201cThe Boys\u201d \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t revealed if he has any plans to relaunch it in the future. Ennis tells CBR: \u2018You have to appreciate how powerful a comic book series like \u201cThe Boys\u201d is that it just can\u2019t be stopped by anybody. \u2018 There is no stopping it. \u2018It\u2019s a genre comic. People expect it. \u201cSo for him to have a series that has this success that wasn\u2019t part of the plan is a bit of an eye opener, especially knowing he is still working on a follow-up book. Ennis then joker, saying that, just like Deadpool, he will be back for more. Ennis is currently writing a second book in the series, titled \u201cThe Boys Season Two. \u201cIt feels as if it\u2019s going to be a massive run. It\u2019s not like Deadpool, you know? I don\u2019t necessarily see his comics being as popular as Deadpool 2. Ennis revealed he will be writing it, too, but in the event that Deadpool makes it to the big screen, how much will he write on screen and how much will the screen write on the comic? Ennis told me he\u2019s a big fan of comic book movies and is interested to write the screenplay for one of them. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Deadpool\u2019s writer Ryan Reynolds said the film\u2019s cast is still very open to any creative ideas from his team. When ENVISION Studios approached them about a potential The Boys movie, Reynolds said they were initially rebuffed but eventually agreed to the terms of the movie deal. ENVISION Studios has a number of films in the works, including one that is set to begin production just before filming for the upcoming Deadpool 2 begins. Filming for the Deadpool 2 movie is expected to begin in February 2021, but it is the release of the film that is the most important thing. Deadpool 2 will be released on May 25, 2021.

For others, it refers to a pretty princess dress, or even a specific look that goes along with that princess\u2019s beauty. But as you can see, cute has many different meanings, depending on who\u2019s being cute and what their purpose is.\nSo why are we so fascinated by the phrase? Are we just trying to be cute or, if not, do we have more profound reasons for being cute?","token_len":628,"entropy":[9.9666,10.2094,3.611,2.8672,4.0209,3.7438,3.9715,4.261,3.0345,8.183,2.0591,2.5247,1.2017,5.2996,0.0257,0.0118,10.6982,6.8747,0.6747,2.5098,0.2235,0.0532,0.9525,4.1785,3.349,4.8599,3.5551,5.4083,0.6591,1.3862,2.6523,2.2544,7.5481,0.2063,0.0143,0.0005,0.3632,0.7481,2.3188,0.7321,1.1465,8.4148,16.0397,7.3134,1.3778,3.7831,1.2472,6.2342,3.0332,1.0775,0.5339,0.4888,1.0031,3.6291,4.7406,6.3226,1.9994,5.1846,3.5359,5.43,0.3689,1.6528,0.666,3.3442,9.6253,0.077,4.3584,3.9008,2.1047,4.6296,6.3063,8.2636,5.0601,2.8486,8.5621,2.4117,8.3377,2.3674,3.3671,1.8443,4.4946,0.6786,0.0559,0.0241,4.2898,3.6845,0.7309,2.6296,1.8602,0.9248,0.4763,5.1072,0.0306,1.5065,2.655,0.4154,0.3465,0.1192,3.7598,0.0009,4.7563,4.611,0.064,4.0139,3.1989,5.5542,4.6474,3.117,0.8865,6.6525,2.2003,6.2212,2.7723,2.7007,1.1927,4.4595,4.1957,3.7585,0.1055,0.138,0.0698,0.0555,0.0506,1.1,4.1662,0.746,5.6327,3.7435,1.092,0.2305,0.7456,1.6598,2.8984,3.2678,4.7054,0.7202,2.6665,1.7914,9.3611,1.772,1.4351,5.0943,1.5922,1.021,2.0305,0.2981,4.0761,2.2313,0.3843,0.0328,2.2531,6.5015,7.9812,1.5123,4.9907,6.5778,1.4401,2.0319,2.2699,3.2279,3.5176,5.0367,5.2203,0.8316,2.8334,2.0297,4.0369,1.3969,2.8828,3.8461,5.717,2.9489,6.4869,0.311,0.3115,0.5688,6.9628,0.0069,1.4658,3.8691,1.9986,2.3657,3.1517,1.185,2.0499,4.9081,0.6887,3.2107,3.5028,6.5395,3.1545,3.0103,3.6026,2.0862,0.2185,3.1552,4.055,0.7044,0.0101,3.876,0.9559,7.5381,0.0008,6.294,8.7182,12.1598,5.7181,2.6934,1.3418,4.1646,5.4794,0.5839,7.4392,0.6448,0.9515,3.2439,1.7148,3.6687,2.2087,1.6304,1.0642,3.4416,0.0022,2.7901,2.9963,3.2982,1.923,3.4347,1.801,2.436,0.5363,0.6056,1.0002,2.5931,3.1517,0.8704,0.5763,1.6899,8.9464,3.3859,4.0865,2.6869,0.8867,3.3192,6.7473,4.9768,0.5334,2.3485,2.0316,0.0666,0.0953,1.8259,0.2813,0.4356,1.0548,5.6065,7.1303,1.39,2.104,1.6744,0.0348,0.0273,3.4753,3.2517,5.0146,2.7754,3.2154,1.4187,1.9989,2.5656,2.1141,0.2958,0.1332,0.0536,7.2723,3.0181,5.5619,6.1785,2.1878,3.4049,2.9094,0.1776,2.6157,5.3533,1.1504,9.2237,0.0008,6.078,3.7246,3.8018,0.9613,2.4091,4.3731,3.3027,2.8298,1.1198,2.1951,4.7174,1.2072,6.166,1.1021,2.2996,5.0279,0.3925,1.0864,0.872,1.1807,0.0343,0.4367,6.8669,1.7956,2.296,1.7101,4.224,4.5207,4.0388,3.0928,1.1713,0.5515,0.3494,2.5108,6.143,5.7877,0.6857,2.2828,2.4576,0.7448,2.332,0.0003,3.3552,5.3449,1.9562,3.633,0.0458,0.9317,4.3565,1.9526,0.1492,0.1634,4.3408,1.2125,2.6788,0.8976,3.4705,4.4603,2.3525,4.0208,3.4755,5.9373,0.4699,3.0,0.7271,1.6353,0.2397,4.2969,3.2324,0.1322,0.2676,3.7055,0.0235,0.346,6.6265,6.1866,0.0562,0.0291,3.5206,4.5914,0.291,1.513,2.983,3.6887,4.7719,0.0566,0.0551,6.3503,1.7739,4.0401,3.2851,6.712,0.9205,3.5037,3.8738,1.4834,4.3192,2.7923,3.5709,0.4559,5.0218,10.1271,9.5042,2.548,7.1763,4.3345,6.4601,0.8762,2.6969,2.2656,7.4827,2.6979,1.9744,0.2489,1.0334,1.0461,1.9598,1.5165,6.7915,9.4871,0.0792,3.6612,3.8638,1.6855,0.3507,3.0191,7.1071,1.7698,0.6598,2.961,3.863,0.3778,3.5041,0.051,0.0013,1.0885,1.9751,2.9152,4.4377,0.0022,2.706,0.8018,1.1088,0.3017,1.281,0.4939,3.539,1.9068,1.76,1.2473,1.0688,4.042,1.3081,7.1803,2.8237,5.4519,4.1141,1.3343,2.6303,1.5906,1.4064,8.7899,0.8897,6.7308,0.121,1.0826,0.8168,3.0986,0.3566,1.1118,1.1927,2.1778,0.035,0.3778,0.6125,3.3291,7.6073,1.5634,2.1198,3.2896,1.2861,5.8538,5.9748,1.4251,0.8045,1.5549,0.5694,1.9723,1.7358,1.0343,2.4406,4.3775,2.049,5.3716,0.9128,1.7596,1.3228,2.0174,1.0504,2.1712,3.4428,0.493,2.3279,0.6219,4.6677,0.3219,3.9368,2.623,2.9067,3.1229,9.7975,1.8403,0.0668,0.1419,1.5818,7.0623,1.6371,1.7293,2.305,2.7447,6.5247,0.3436,8.6649,4.1293,1.4854,5.6382,1.301,6.2187,4.9923,3.3611,1.1084,0.282,1.371,6.688,0.0178,2.0649,0.0633,3.7402,2.6528,2.2875,10.1256,10.2645,0.8205,6.3291,0.191,0.1126,0.4635,1.2004,3.2619,6.0198,2.1227,2.041,3.305,0.6128,3.3114,1.5208,0.1452,0.2901,6.1207,0.0428,2.1179,7.1397,6.3269,7.6978,1.3659,2.6572,2.719,0.8257,8.0378,5.1609,2.2417,5.004,2.6788,0.048,4.1091,3.3254,8.5077,0.2204,0.5714,6.1906,0.2535,3.085,4.5179,3.5588,2.0481,0.7841,1.1956,9.5438,4.7609,4.58,2.3759,0.3717,1.7188,3.8634,0.0516,1.8947,4.1624,0.0945,0.043,4.5901,3.4932,2.4106,1.5602,3.2479,4.8965,0.1703,0.3086,2.8301,5.0566,4.1574,2.425,1.6454,1.5955,3.1785,0.7384,1.3979,5.0559,3.0848,4.2744,0.8234,2.2625,3.8605,0.0233,2.7611,1.11,2.3341,5.5896,4.0535,1.4671,0.4193,3.5063,0.4049,2.921,4.384,7.7039,4.382,0.8688,2.024,1.3334,0.2816]}
{"prompt":"You have the most useless superpower in a world full of awesome superpowers . You are a laughinstock , that is until you start using your power for evil ... no one is laughing now .","text":"You have the most useless superpower in a world full of awesome superpowers. You are a laughinstock, that is until you start using your power for evil... no one is laughing now. It is a very short game. There will be no dialogue, no explanation, no hints. Make your choices and move forward. It is best if you have little to no experience of superpower games. But if you have, you are going to love Dead Air. The game is not easy, but it is really fun.\nI think the game could be really fun if you do not want to be a \"good guy\". The rules are simple, and if you think the choices will affect the story that is a bit over the top. It's okay tho, because I found myself still enjoying the game after the death toll had reached three. Good graphics and good sound, but no dialogues, so maybe you should look for a different story line.\nI love Dead Air. It is one of those games where you have to carefully choose every option. The first chapter I found a little hard, but that doesn't last long. It's easy to get sucked into the drama and that makes you want to find out what happens next. The graphics are great. The only thing I found out is that the developers worked hard for the game's completion.\nI like the game. It is challenging, interesting, and a good storyline. The only problem is that the graphics is bad. Most of the models are static and the environment is a bit of a mess.\nThis game is easy to play and really entertaining. There is no clear direction given at the start of the game, it is very mysterious what the goal of you is when you start playing. After you gain power, the game is so different from what you were told at the beginning. However, once you get power the game is not so interesting anymore and you have to do other things to keep it going. If you like superpowers and puzzles this is a great game.\nSuper fun, I can't find ANY negative comments about the game. It's very interesting, with lots of puzzles, very addicting, good graphics, and beautiful music. I think the only thing I would suggest is an option to switch between different power-ups. Because you can't customize your own superhero.\nI've only played one chapter so far and there's quite a lot more to do. If you plan on playing the whole game you'll have to go through the story twice. That's ok though because of all the variety there is to the story. The graphics aren't too bad, a little rough but thats how superpowers work. The music, graphics, and voice work are superb. I have to say that I can imagine doing this game again in about a year to see what I would find. I definitely would recommend this game to anybody who likes a good puzzle game. If you like a good superhero game and a great puzzle just go get it. This game also has a great fanart section on their website with all the different characters of the game.","token_len":630,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3197,4.8012,7.1145,8.0804,1.1194,5.0985,2.8249,3.4497,0.0009,6.2426,4.7956,0.4241,1.0525,2.3265,2.5431,2.9341,11.5901,17.1935,3.8851,2.4244,4.9602,1.985,4.9401,0.6315,3.4564,3.9865,1.8035,3.6469,3.815,3.5928,5.9962,5.9549,3.0078,2.4677,2.4475,4.6877,0.7377,3.4362,1.3234,2.5799,3.7646,5.3947,3.3114,1.5845,3.5557,3.2208,0.2769,2.2007,5.3087,1.4741,0.8209,5.7569,1.0492,0.8437,5.5093,1.8709,6.9182,2.2044,3.7047,1.9341,4.8561,1.2243,0.761,3.0792,0.8307,5.7404,2.3222,0.1442,2.4471,6.1305,1.7718,0.1538,2.864,4.2558,11.7287,2.6305,0.7569,4.5422,1.7899,0.1221,0.9059,3.7052,1.604,2.6302,2.5602,0.0179,3.118,10.0854,7.8877,0.7131,3.4839,1.4573,0.7945,3.6009,4.105,1.5027,0.9125,1.1096,0.6524,5.0905,0.7398,0.7696,2.2645,5.5617,3.8049,2.4068,2.2559,4.905,1.1078,5.3892,1.5491,1.1794,1.1149,5.0501,1.2725,3.1796,0.1666,3.4005,1.7927,4.7623,4.6345,1.8816,1.7414,2.7321,5.0509,0.5172,1.2696,1.0912,2.163,3.5768,0.1688,4.5082,2.9899,7.8415,2.8913,5.8138,1.8391,4.3142,5.4085,2.2267,3.5881,3.4725,4.6889,1.4018,0.0089,0.6675,2.8166,2.8506,5.7166,9.017,1.1585,2.9478,2.5628,4.9567,1.6494,6.08,3.9528,0.9464,0.4765,3.4596,2.7194,4.9184,8.9767,4.4482,4.559,5.4129,1.1966,6.0504,7.6093,1.5413,3.0088,2.7321,3.0323,1.4617,4.0649,6.2127,1.2529,1.7649,4.2414,4.8797,1.3922,2.5036,4.6961,2.4923,2.1278,2.3167,3.8963,3.9807,0.75,1.4795,1.9869,3.7701,1.4271,0.0195,1.0189,1.3759,0.8534,2.8154,0.05,1.8393,0.5046,1.7087,0.8089,1.8144,0.4318,7.3791,2.1967,5.938,2.7324,2.0633,2.2585,3.8849,6.8222,4.8423,2.9825,4.2304,2.5977,3.2309,2.265,0.8704,3.1873,3.8785,0.0014,7.1311,0.8476,0.4391,2.4219,2.2905,4.522,0.3838,2.0971,3.9358,0.2764,0.8459,7.8593,1.8434,4.5932,3.6016,3.0182,1.8345,0.0961,4.9162,1.1399,1.3682,2.6628,0.6471,0.3229,1.5533,6.0487,0.4316,2.9686,2.2962,0.9191,5.3272,1.689,0.966,3.8131,4.3691,1.8341,0.4314,1.279,6.868,5.821,1.3879,3.7065,1.5388,1.4427,3.2242,6.4626,0.7684,3.1417,1.7441,3.3268,1.7154,1.8802,0.9875,1.3586,0.8264,4.9897,0.962,4.8667,0.4393,0.5483,3.136,2.566,8.524,0.3654,1.8463,2.7918,1.8077,0.7032,0.5773,1.5566,4.514,4.5022,2.9258,0.4961,5.7633,0.8694,0.1848,8.002,0.8538,7.5442,1.4767,2.3942,6.2062,0.7619,3.1755,1.3411,3.7983,0.2832,0.3602,0.2992,3.0401,3.2381,0.8311,0.6302,4.3317,0.3834,1.3313,2.2872,4.1757,4.8388,0.2303,3.2583,1.0544,1.4347,7.5947,3.7065,5.1103,4.4367,1.2358,1.2475,1.3341,0.2194,0.0939,1.0977,3.518,1.1348,2.598,8.4294,6.9653,2.4278,4.2015,2.1602,5.5924,1.2459,4.8264,0.2231,2.2835,3.0054,0.7724,5.2003,1.8757,6.1764,3.7681,0.7271,2.3309,0.7336,2.5463,4.9192,4.2652,1.2232,2.6136,0.4914,2.8622,3.7413,3.1626,0.5892,0.3084,1.1061,4.9723,0.1569,3.7974,0.1163,1.6237,3.7218,4.1525,0.4596,1.1779,3.771,1.6801,4.2463,1.6856,3.152,1.4891,1.8736,0.2202,3.734,4.4376,0.2235,1.119,4.1373,2.4361,1.5889,0.1631,3.958,0.1964,3.1117,7.0437,0.3501,2.0719,5.2299,4.6162,1.0886,1.0723,2.2221,0.1557,0.966,1.1292,7.5595,5.3283,2.3664,4.1151,3.6648,0.605,5.2312,7.2385,5.2512,3.5999,1.793,1.7837,0.2344,0.5924,1.7868,2.6353,3.1399,3.7446,1.3669,4.6212,2.3509,0.0436,3.4901,1.2401,5.106,6.8569,0.1621,1.0989,5.2273,1.9479,0.3925,0.8193,6.6261,1.1942,0.1394,1.8152,2.9372,1.6068,3.6857,1.8578,0.9467,1.9787,4.6716,0.735,6.6191,4.6921,0.3534,3.9913,2.2165,2.8135,3.9592,3.7085,0.4854,1.3508,6.4784,2.7887,1.179,2.5268,6.0269,1.459,2.6303,9.3923,2.7601,1.1857,1.7309,4.49,3.5312,0.5892,2.5055,5.1772,2.3658,0.0558,1.7636,3.933,2.7224,5.5941,0.0736,0.9217,3.8344,0.9647,2.2928,0.5262,2.7991,0.1896,6.1488,0.6619,0.938,1.9684,2.9271,0.2614,2.3029,2.587,1.9366,0.1857,3.5536,1.2315,1.7833,3.3614,6.4892,0.9353,4.371,0.7754,3.9866,2.7577,2.8486,4.8507,3.6794,0.164,6.9565,4.1942,0.5843,2.8791,3.1869,1.2508,0.4228,1.9228,5.2215,4.255,0.0032,3.3601,0.2877,1.1657,6.043,1.2466,4.0019,2.2162,7.2115,4.1379,9.395,1.4658,1.2428,0.3133,1.5338,2.4341,3.9605,5.4667,0.2126,0.3298,4.3663,3.7074,1.2777,5.9309,0.4098,1.977,3.432,1.6903,0.5205,0.9906,1.5723,4.1058,6.8222,5.1566,1.9175,0.4491,2.7706,3.2213,3.7864,2.0776,0.3762,5.1516,1.8138,1.4705,1.8439,3.4499,4.0564,0.6268,2.0619,5.4742,1.6443,0.6764,0.7978,0.2582,0.7572,3.3234,1.4099,2.6303,3.0071,1.4899,4.9389,0.1994,0.4445,3.3588,0.1322,1.899,2.5163,0.7877,4.8171,0.572,2.8526,4.0936,2.3372,4.3955,9.0668,2.409,4.4567,0.91,0.4837,4.0577,0.5947,5.2761,0.8424,1.0694,2.8751,6.8665,4.6575,4.2232,2.8611,3.6011,0.9561,4.2798,3.0157,0.5501,4.5258,2.8708,4.4907,0.6099,0.4253,0.4636]}

I used a couple of the party bags that were on their website and put them on the tables as well. The girl's had a wonderful gift idea for each guest in their party. We had a gift bag with little gifts that were small such as jewelry, handbags, scarves and other clothes that we put in the gift bags and gave it to each guest.

{"prompt":"Aliens establish first contact with the government of another country . The White House gets offended .","text":"Aliens establish first contact with the government of another country. The White House gets offended. The military is ready for action but the President won\u2019t act. Why?\nThe American government is not the government of our time, it is the government of the United States of America before 1939, the state has a strong nationalist character and it has a strong monopoly in national security.\nYou can argue that in Europe or in France or in England as part of Britain, you can argue whatever. The problem is that when we think of the United States as an independent country, we have strong arguments for not being so nationalist.\nI thought our government was more nationalist \u2013 I would be more tolerant of the invasion of Iraq\u2013 but I do not think that it is true as the nationalist idea dominates, and its idea that war is a way to maintain the national state.\nI think the United States is a much simpler country than its government is, and we should not be very harsh on this government, because it does not work well, because we don\u2019t see its weaknesses. This is the main weakness of this government, is that we see the US as a strong and powerful country, but we must be very critical because this is not the case.\nHow is the President, as leader of a country, supposed to operate in a country like Iraq where he cannot really rule and does not have the power to act, where his command over the different institutions of the republic lacks, even with his own armed forces?\nHow can the president make decisions if a part of his command does not speak to him, and does not show him respect as Commander in Chief, the commander-in-chief of the military does not rule. What is even more important is the attitude of the judiciary, because no president can govern the country if the highest courts refuse to cooperate with him.\nI have no hope that if a war is declared it will be successful, even if it is a military campaign, because there are a lot of problems.\nThe situation is very clear \u2013 the occupation of Iraq is not legal, the United States is not a super power \u2013 we are also very clear that this situation has a deep ideological aspect \u2013 a foreign war, the destruction of an Arab country, the destruction of a civilization, the death of civilians, and so on.\nThe United States is not the creator of this ideology. It is the ideology imposed on the people by foreign forces who have occupied our country, which is something very difficult to overcome, because to make us accept that our government has not been able to govern us for 30 years is a very difficult job for any democrat.\nIt can, it can be, but it will cost a lot, and that is true because a democratic society does not create these conflicts, where you have the government and the national security forces fighting each other.\nBut that does not mean we lose hope. We don\u2019t know which way this war will go, as no one knows for sure who will win \u2026 We should wait and watch, but it is no longer time for speeches.","token_len":630,"entropy":[9.9962,12.2032,6.7902,1.7648,0.3415,1.6077,9.2754,0.7645,5.6066,1.6515,1.9089,2.159,7.8148,0.2603,6.9951,10.2577,2.1858,1.8729,4.9728,3.0242,5.6694,2.3901,2.8496,4.7592,2.1604,5.3025,6.2032,16.6798,7.9168,2.1909,4.4574,0.8215,5.757,1.2166,2.5685,5.7468,4.6564,3.1317,1.6632,2.3982,3.5374,3.6037,0.3725,4.7819,5.8484,2.2848,2.2157,0.5361,0.5659,0.5145,0.0647,1.3243,1.4391,0.0255,0.665,0.0145,8.829,8.5856,2.5963,2.488,6.4268,5.843,3.1672,5.0045,6.7154,3.1822,1.3868,2.6511,1.6767,1.6008,1.2299,7.8738,2.5074,4.7781,2.1825,0.4774,2.0953,5.6633,2.0327,4.2763,0.5756,4.4835,5.1227,4.2635,1.6762,5.0237,1.4562,0.6395,4.0441,5.5871,6.7009,0.0026,6.4371,1.4459,3.3807,1.6137,0.8567,7.9429,4.7277,2.3178,3.6008,0.4066,0.6897,3.8306,2.6328,4.2401,1.0102,1.3837,2.3869,0.0257,1.7117,2.5289,2.4424,1.4557,0.7331,1.0757,3.2184,8.4532,6.4831,1.2996,4.568,3.0248,5.2777,9.8593,0.5718,1.2424,3.1561,5.7799,5.7752,2.9642,1.0095,3.706,2.4487,7.1592,2.8065,4.3736,4.1909,2.8097,6.2779,0.923,2.3828,7.7259,0.3507,0.953,6.9616,1.9533,1.9378,4.2932,0.6706,0.6318,1.2196,2.92,1.2777,4.6885,4.1251,3.3309,7.3746,5.3706,8.7044,4.8368,2.4291,5.543,6.2324,2.5856,7.0611,0.5933,2.1838,3.633,1.305,5.0719,1.9754,4.5101,4.5879,2.1855,0.6943,2.3875,0.95,1.9497,2.3647,0.0079,1.0578,1.6195,4.9296,5.6255,1.5066,1.1264,4.0703,3.5793,1.9376,2.3026,1.3731,3.0108,3.3645,1.4196,1.5452,5.9937,5.0746,0.9538,4.6995,3.0586,2.3647,1.6379,1.1606,3.2449,0.2815,5.3268,2.7437,3.0153,2.538,2.6671,3.0747,5.7452,0.7691,0.0583,4.8318,4.3089,6.2001,0.8465,4.8492,0.9103,2.1341,4.4195,4.6017,0.4795,3.0888,0.5076,1.4332,3.1609,0.7379,2.6946,3.7158,2.6051,5.6023,0.7168,0.8921,4.9661,2.4373,3.1917,2.1132,1.0888,1.9532,1.1599,6.2766,2.6065,1.9013,5.4773,4.9914,3.2701,1.262,1.81,1.8121,2.3914,0.6046,0.4821,5.263,3.2195,1.6528,4.534,4.5186,3.4653,5.4714,0.2698,2.0422,1.6923,0.9283,3.447,0.0013,5.6529,1.568,1.4186,2.2975,2.405,3.7523,3.5243,1.9944,3.7252,6.019,4.4589,3.2849,5.6178,0.0383,0.9782,1.046,2.2765,0.3156,3.4384,2.5366,2.6963,2.8908,6.4897,4.6098,0.8244,8.2072,4.3494,2.0699,0.9395,7.4374,7.6763,3.0995,4.5383,3.8781,2.1537,1.861,6.2103,0.1676,1.5195,0.4186,4.3244,1.7267,1.9461,2.642,4.2015,1.4324,4.2373,5.3908,5.8907,0.0311,1.0902,3.4935,2.757,0.0141,5.2283,1.6482,0.7971,1.8246,1.525,4.3635,0.0072,5.8335,1.9982,4.6636,4.72,4.5836,0.7482,0.0369,1.9849,3.9902,3.0211,2.3647,0.0014,0.0128,0.0098,0.7737,0.6856,2.3513,6.0897,0.1486,5.758,3.5772,4.2096,1.4136,5.6065,0.4343,1.9489,0.5651,2.3146,6.4602,0.4531,0.4524,8.3007,1.076,3.1552,5.8276,2.7942,1.2127,4.0724,3.2171,1.2992,3.4076,2.5452,6.8614,3.5566,4.2198,0.1347,6.5216,0.4937,0.3939,0.6623,0.5713,2.5382,2.8245,3.6227,5.8955,0.9252,4.8009,3.2944,6.3837,1.5246,1.9182,4.2919,0.3247,0.6257,4.5173,1.1214,4.4784,0.5737,1.2442,0.9044,2.1208,2.9796,3.8008,0.965,1.4159,3.0005,1.3356,3.2586,0.4853,0.0177,2.8954,2.137,1.6874,2.1269,4.5328,1.4264,2.2656,4.1588,4.4808,1.5793,6.306,0.8266,0.3588,1.2464,2.0522,6.2718,1.0839,1.9599,3.6658,0.0479,1.2722,0.3822,1.5617,8.0691,1.2435,4.0243,3.6555,1.2838,6.1629,4.0588,4.6024,0.9165,3.3052,5.0277,3.0929,2.8213,5.7193,5.2428,4.541,4.0466,3.2838,6.7662,4.3091,2.2767,3.0939,6.0988,0.0363,4.5375,3.1641,1.3561,0.7974,1.5729,2.2276,0.0164,1.172,6.0377,1.0301,1.4066,4.8932,0.1004,6.6174,1.2103,2.6181,1.8364,0.1001,0.3242,0.4695,1.9152,2.5704,0.0114,1.023,1.2955,2.0505,8.154,0.1521,1.8899,5.7802,0.9238,1.5679,0.3353,1.2089,6.683,8.1429,1.2584,1.3253,1.2886,1.7068,4.5825,3.1048,3.8177,2.1592,5.7323,3.3327,0.3252,1.734,3.4265,0.8498,4.819,3.6247,2.9801,0.8945,5.2132,1.8692,1.2627,5.8299,4.0577,5.6129,4.2794,2.0542,3.6174,1.6412,2.3493,3.7556,1.4624,3.1309,0.0138,3.1149,4.0999,3.5909,4.3815,0.1034,2.1452,2.2684,1.1888,0.7508,4.6378,3.2994,2.5477,9.2212,0.7348,0.2498,3.2115,4.671,5.0773,3.8211,0.5637,1.9547,2.2988,0.9573,0.9409,3.0985,6.0771,2.7507,0.0816,2.8448,1.3131,2.8143,0.4765,5.2333,3.5847,4.3909,3.1566,2.6223,3.1351,0.0304,5.8933,4.5217,4.1015,1.4789,5.3406,3.1963,1.1145,2.7036,3.7643,2.9759,0.8321,6.1615,1.7141,2.8183,3.3036,1.0894,0.0043,1.2368,0.4939,3.8284,3.3526,1.982,0.0285,0.2241,2.6426,6.7233,5.0871,1.1118,1.8591,4.2191,0.5538,0.1374,0.014,2.8481,4.5422,1.396,3.1357,1.4702,0.6351,0.626,1.0817,4.6197,6.1062,1.0434,1.4592,3.6624,0.3132,4.4735,0.6897,1.4609,8.1939,3.0126,4.2168,5.1021,1.4828,4.9697,1.8395,1.527,2.4131,0.7518,5.7161,2.2714,4.7438,1.462,8.3947,1.2645]}

The war ends with a victory for the U.S forces but the trench warfare continues for years with the survivors fighting against the same forces they fought.\n[\u2026] In the previous post we saw how to make a video game for Apple Arcade. That was all very cool, but this time we\u2019re gonna make a game for Google \u2026 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] I mentioned a bit back the other day that we made a video game for Apple Arcade. Well now I have an Android version of that game as well! This post will show you how that [\u2026]\n[\u2026] video game for Apple Arcade ( a new category for Apple Arcade games that I\u2019ve been experimenting with ) as well as an Android game. This post will show you how to make a [\u2026]\n[\u2026] game was featured on Apple Arcade and I\u2019m pleased to announce that I\u2019m working on an Android version right now. If you haven\u2019t checked out my previous [\u2026]\n[\u2026] you like the story, I\u2019ll have it available on Apple Arcade soon! This post will show you how to create a game for Apple Arcade, how to make it multiplayer, as well as [\u2026]\nI would very much like to work on a project like this one, I could have a go and a feel of how it\u2019s done.\nIf I want to make a game, would it be possible to use another software and program that generates the scenes ( like a game editor ), and then use the same to export and create scenes into other game engines? \u2013 This game engine is just a programming framework. You can write your game in C or any other language. \u2013\nThis game engine is just a programming framework. You can write your game in C or any other language. It is for the game developer. You can get the game playable by just writing this source code. You can write your source code in any language. The game engine just provides the framework. Here you can find the tutorial for developing games in this game engine. Game design and programming part ( source code ) are separate for game developers. The developer just needs to write the code and he can run the game without learning any programming language. Just write the game in a graphical designer like Unity. Unity is free game engine for game development.\nWhen I see the screen there are some bugs. Is there any solution for those? So, you might like to develop you game on another platform.\nNot at this time. I know you can\u2019t just go out and get a license for the game engine. That would require purchasing a license key for the engine. However, there were a few times when I made games and didn\u2019t have the time to develop them as I wanted, but could still have other projects to go before my other projects. I just used third-party game engines and developed games from them using their source. For the game engine used in this example, I used Unity.","token_len":631,"entropy":[4.0641,8.329,6.7936,4.0826,4.4858,12.0741,1.7734,4.2342,0.2392,2.2476,2.319,7.2891,1.3546,1.1033,12.2042,6.1561,2.3855,2.372,7.4816,3.0067,2.077,11.351,1.8189,7.6039,2.1922,6.6426,1.2677,2.0048,3.6802,4.4571,5.7771,1.2994,1.8632,2.4971,1.3664,0.7512,5.2577,0.1359,0.0286,8.5013,2.5745,1.6319,8.7439,0.5617,3.6283,2.8888,3.2462,3.7478,1.5317,5.5707,3.7243,3.484,1.1711,6.0886,2.1865,3.6118,1.6895,3.4828,2.174,9.1162,6.0335,4.8463,1.4752,6.5359,2.9496,2.1436,3.6162,1.5735,2.0926,2.5755,1.1301,5.2401,0.9801,3.6256,8.4623,8.4793,1.7987,4.756,2.1113,5.0694,4.5576,3.3694,1.5096,0.8615,3.5583,1.3903,0.9606,18.1313,8.9898,2.1176,3.7742,1.9159,0.931,1.367,1.2243,5.5649,8.7379,7.6601,1.8545,1.317,0.2765,3.1258,6.2499,3.6571,4.1719,4.6481,5.3582,0.8638,0.0822,0.397,2.8708,4.3061,0.6189,1.6968,0.1327,0.8273,1.9828,0.4251,0.9559,3.7148,4.0273,2.3701,2.4868,3.4181,5.7414,2.7837,1.027,2.0239,1.41,4.6069,0.0522,2.9711,3.8234,6.1318,1.5447,2.5388,0.2247,0.2819,5.8734,9.6245,0.422,0.73,0.0533,7.546,0.13,5.1208,1.2107,0.1062,3.9125,6.4169,4.0998,6.3982,1.8686,2.9767,0.5515,2.4495,4.6158,4.0658,9.404,0.6229,1.4831,1.7172,6.511,0.0875,1.5183,6.411,0.4749,0.0569,3.572,1.9064,1.9499,2.154,3.0908,3.484,0.5311,0.5926,0.0875,0.2882,1.0316,0.4955,0.4682,4.4758,0.3695,0.7037,0.0404,4.018,10.5286,6.1439,1.0097,3.4095,1.1994,3.2043,2.7859,3.3158,0.125,4.3272,6.1411,0.617,1.4762,0.4844,2.0869,1.793,0.0738,0.5848,2.7985,0.2556,2.1425,0.8518,1.8376,7.2884,0.0861,0.7025,4.189,0.1642,3.6612,1.3375,0.7468,0.0522,4.7135,0.4074,1.5887,2.6108,5.6219,0.2499,0.4802,0.0155,4.9932,7.2701,2.4471,5.0758,2.426,3.2331,1.7003,0.1043,2.2877,4.8374,2.959,5.7758,2.0717,3.1829,0.1095,4.1966,1.7978,3.8763,1.1758,0.3216,0.5277,0.0317,0.1838,0.1682,2.8276,0.5703,1.6296,0.9267,0.3949,0.1005,2.7042,4.5636,0.1572,1.0937,2.8268,8.3737,1.4698,4.3023,0.1188,0.1197,1.609,0.2628,3.5193,4.8674,6.0124,0.0937,0.2809,0.0826,7.097,0.7013,1.1974,3.4088,3.0218,0.4499,2.1373,1.5508,2.3561,5.1444,2.9473,2.6497,7.1751,3.6697,5.3236,5.8874,3.743,2.047,1.6028,6.3953,0.2201,1.8701,3.6919,2.0307,3.7134,4.3447,3.256,3.9768,0.2028,2.37,0.8986,0.4692,2.156,6.0069,3.1527,0.5803,2.36,0.3504,4.0928,6.743,4.4103,3.5148,6.4986,2.033,6.3462,1.9637,7.5898,4.622,4.9998,3.3122,2.137,4.9271,5.4796,2.5084,2.3549,2.9025,1.8863,2.4186,5.5596,6.9666,3.5358,3.9107,2.8513,5.4039,3.265,3.5055,2.0207,1.1032,7.9864,4.3042,5.2501,4.8705,1.3329,4.6402,1.7944,5.9511,5.5253,2.3384,4.0137,1.1299,4.2572,2.1728,3.6822,1.9195,3.1396,2.2785,4.6506,0.8305,0.163,1.341,5.8129,4.0637,3.1969,1.388,0.513,0.4557,0.1814,0.0217,0.0248,0.0008,0.0117,0.0326,0.003,0.0034,0.0003,0.0008,0.0016,0.0066,0.0007,0.0015,0.0001,0.0023,0.0008,2.8151,1.4757,6.0797,2.1064,4.3005,3.3553,1.9342,2.7166,0.5641,5.1386,2.0993,1.7722,7.0656,2.6361,4.2036,3.7316,5.3841,6.5574,0.1626,1.0495,2.966,0.3151,4.1682,1.065,7.0397,0.0539,0.9986,1.4803,0.3969,0.7021,3.1147,1.1916,1.0674,5.9977,4.3255,1.6812,4.5404,1.858,5.7149,2.6165,0.4964,2.7801,1.4346,5.4986,2.1914,5.096,4.3403,1.7439,3.5165,3.0111,0.137,0.5836,6.8447,5.9546,2.6588,3.5714,6.7759,5.3572,6.2869,0.5192,1.1025,3.6979,5.6238,5.2901,4.1917,0.9545,0.5708,2.8201,4.8956,3.8147,1.9993,0.2433,2.4328,0.9322,0.7894,1.7259,4.7162,1.5422,4.174,0.6951,0.2995,3.4547,7.2829,1.454,1.7183,0.7818,0.3255,6.0386,2.547,0.8845,2.0782,2.2244,2.3986,7.2675,7.9557,4.6267,1.9726,1.6473,4.7771,0.8057,5.0898,4.7627,0.6251,2.7196,2.6004,3.0964,0.4638,2.3455,5.1574,1.3482,4.4579,2.3981,6.2102,6.8075,1.4531,3.1795,6.0729,1.8516,4.7325,1.0111,1.4792,3.7739,2.0593,3.3002,1.8032,5.1631,2.5569,3.5491,3.3001,2.9739,0.3486,5.7015,6.5604,1.0677,3.1277,4.1498,0.7962,1.1154,2.3847,6.913,3.9019,2.0006,0.7743,0.9254,1.7446,4.7387,2.913,3.2651,5.3631,0.3111,0.038,4.6167,3.4214,3.4755,0.3066,3.7676,1.7682,7.0329,1.6386,2.0316,0.337,3.9561,1.1466,3.9048,2.1103,4.4966,6.5288,1.1394,1.5981,7.6692,2.2153,0.9131,4.3879,0.7378,4.4369,0.1723,3.0781,4.9486,2.1756,0.8976,4.2824,0.9921,0.5693,4.7468,3.2608,3.4748,4.3459,0.4898,0.3471,0.0259,2.1361,1.4214,2.3883,0.496,2.74,1.3634,4.429,2.3246,1.5828,3.7339,2.636,5.8844,3.3474,3.5879,5.3639,2.2695,2.1696,3.6354,5.6728,4.4055,5.0372,1.8274,1.9766,2.1501,4.3171,4.9193,7.3279,2.1914,0.0188,3.4266,1.0783,2.1443,3.9348,2.588,4.1479,2.8467,5.8872,3.0045,3.671,4.4678,4.6021,2.6099,2.2617,1.0315,7.8165,1.384,0.8143,4.5529,0.7476,1.4202,2.3141,2.4726,1.5433]}
{"prompt":"Across the universe humans are feared and revered as `` Dreamwalkers '' . Back on earth we 're just sleeping and dreaming as usual .","text":"Across the universe humans are feared and revered as `` Dreamwalkers ''. Back on earth we're just sleeping and dreaming as usual. There they have the ability to do what anyone of us can do.They can walk on water through walls and do crazy things. This is why they keep to themselves. I do not know what makes human dreamwalker. I don t know if they feel happy but I know that they are happy. Dreamwalker are some humans. The ones that can see things the rest of us cant see. A very special power. The humans that can do this can see and be able to move into other worlds in a way the others cant. Like I said theyre not happy. Theyre not happy because they cant live on the other side of the worlds, which is the way humans used to live. They cant have animals or plants. I suppose they should have lived the way we used to live like we didnt live in this world. I do not know but I always thought that the best place for those humans would have been the moon. They would have been better off in the moon because there there would of been no humans that they could see. Things would have been much bigger\nIn a fantasy town called Kiel there will be two wizards. The first wizard has a special talent for magic spells and the second wizard has one for making the time go slower. They are best friends; you will soon be able to see it. It is called time traveling. One of the days the first wizard is doing something for the second wizard and they both get locked out of their tower. They were both dreaming that they were in the same room and they had made themselves out to be brothers and sisters and they were trying to play a game. This story would be called a dream of brothers. It is the same story as this song. However both of them are dreaming things they should of never dreamed of.\nIn a fantasy town called Kiel there are twins. They are the most beautiful twins you can ever find. They have the most magical magic you can ever find. They are both special. When they were little they were very little. At first they lived on the same street but things started getting a little complicated and they needed to get to another part of town. To do this you go to the gate. There is a big hole in the ground through which you can get to different parts of town. The twins have special magic that make them able to get to that hole easily. There is also a small house just around the corner. One day a man is walking around the neighborhood with two kids.One is a boy and the other a girl. They are twins just like them. You dont know him but he looks like one of them. They are looking for a place to sleep so they come around the corner and they are looking for places to live. They come to the house. The children are very nice people. They have a nice looking house and they have a nice view of the lake. One of the people is going to sleep. The second part of the story would be how that happened.","token_len":632,"entropy":[2.506,7.5823,9.4795,1.7552,9.2556,1.8518,3.7139,2.1116,11.8132,15.6177,6.7357,0.0063,3.9991,4.7539,8.1094,2.8949,2.6222,3.0297,3.3022,4.0052,9.3596,2.6226,1.5834,4.6938,3.7941,0.5706,4.2377,7.1368,3.6503,3.3711,4.9149,0.0367,4.2773,2.5141,3.985,4.8771,0.7387,1.5905,0.524,1.5162,7.2507,2.7666,4.5164,2.0985,2.5322,6.583,5.2932,1.1592,5.9439,4.81,0.3211,1.2008,5.09,0.6569,2.5951,1.2787,5.1449,5.5517,0.2287,1.1886,4.1349,4.9084,1.1217,1.2399,1.7307,4.423,7.1154,5.0481,5.2196,4.1986,1.7874,2.3294,13.2264,0.2426,2.5059,1.3908,5.0384,4.7805,4.8511,1.7697,2.0002,1.3554,0.7109,1.7964,2.9529,0.8699,5.2022,2.4408,2.2173,5.5624,6.7472,2.9595,4.1542,3.522,1.2312,3.3039,3.714,3.2257,4.8408,4.6481,0.0322,0.6164,4.4198,0.8891,0.4601,5.4064,5.5036,3.4079,5.7473,2.213,3.1009,4.7581,2.1586,2.2883,3.0756,2.5659,3.8412,1.8693,3.3462,5.2476,2.6889,0.0163,4.5652,5.0217,2.7307,1.3297,4.2823,1.9211,2.722,3.8877,3.3431,2.2769,0.3653,6.2202,3.0827,0.2916,2.8449,8.3256,3.1316,3.7313,1.0027,1.3807,2.5446,2.2597,1.3375,2.4471,0.5635,2.1387,4.4351,2.9492,2.183,2.6104,0.4158,0.23,0.331,6.5846,4.3127,4.9146,0.8837,3.3066,4.0694,3.0539,5.8441,0.0112,0.4773,0.5041,1.7128,2.4124,4.1082,7.9952,2.6062,2.4819,2.2115,3.7607,7.3923,1.5698,5.4368,1.9406,5.2211,4.8879,1.0745,1.9284,2.4959,0.0014,0.2682,5.3838,1.7066,5.0597,1.4104,2.3778,2.3596,0.7608,0.5618,2.37,3.3031,0.4496,0.3643,4.8986,1.1286,6.7581,1.9605,1.5566,2.44,4.6179,4.075,1.5704,5.3331,2.5725,2.3759,3.032,0.0494,1.8903,3.592,0.6836,3.1739,2.5712,0.4259,1.0753,4.8373,0.7147,2.1848,1.2418,1.9015,3.4656,2.8698,6.2995,1.1436,8.515,0.7867,1.7596,3.2215,4.1303,4.9255,1.1727,2.999,0.9358,8.0162,1.9386,0.4374,0.3094,2.0214,6.5854,7.4825,6.745,3.1901,5.8446,7.3084,2.3988,5.1185,4.9326,2.6692,5.043,0.1754,4.0212,5.6207,1.8035,2.2106,0.8423,1.6906,3.5331,1.4911,4.4322,3.4136,1.332,1.132,6.616,1.5911,1.4123,0.6227,0.5882,1.0264,4.8608,4.0704,4.765,4.1823,7.6359,2.1717,3.3414,0.4155,2.5596,1.6248,5.6877,0.2407,7.4744,4.2569,3.1326,5.4695,2.2,1.3435,0.006,1.6754,5.6288,1.5207,3.3055,0.9354,3.8906,5.5946,2.7064,0.8484,5.0431,2.1514,0.3963,8.0262,3.0987,3.4316,0.0907,2.5326,6.5422,2.0831,3.8164,1.0591,2.2796,0.1611,2.2351,2.0812,2.9253,2.8619,6.8299,3.2125,0.7936,1.3802,6.2838,0.7554,1.9863,5.0187,2.7855,4.7386,4.0596,1.4083,1.3644,2.7714,1.2335,1.6451,1.7348,1.8721,1.9064,3.0715,5.3051,5.6052,4.0714,1.081,0.0882,7.4088,2.13,0.407,3.0494,1.6568,1.5081,4.2134,0.0734,5.8851,2.7191,1.2095,2.0735,4.0038,5.8414,4.4431,1.7318,3.9339,3.4943,1.8736,4.2024,6.4385,4.0773,2.7731,1.3999,3.1556,2.2686,0.6568,1.6983,5.1391,7.4413,1.31,6.0616,5.9108,2.631,0.4495,1.4135,3.6983,5.9958,2.7119,5.4571,6.0749,3.5542,4.748,1.085,0.6315,3.1517,2.525,1.5799,1.7334,0.562,0.0981,1.378,0.0199,0.3347,3.4179,5.7114,1.1044,1.8327,0.6368,2.4334,4.1522,2.1553,2.0433,1.8526,1.6221,1.4712,3.8282,0.3647,0.7293,2.0222,2.4229,2.5306,2.9359,4.3498,4.8155,0.6672,0.3257,1.2898,0.3534,0.8083,1.0392,3.2087,6.2867,2.3243,4.2957,0.9001,1.7493,2.7352,0.5289,0.9481,2.8701,4.5079,0.9087,4.7708,1.9535,0.3321,4.3198,2.28,0.9393,3.0916,4.8576,2.4117,6.1875,3.4471,3.001,3.5136,0.4897,4.8725,2.2023,0.8831,5.828,0.8562,2.6975,3.1856,5.8313,3.4042,0.0644,1.1842,0.8125,5.0845,2.5933,0.5311,4.2344,4.399,0.659,0.9342,6.7637,2.8049,2.4967,1.2944,0.3351,3.5995,4.2104,0.851,0.1676,1.7517,6.7656,0.6846,0.8512,0.7891,3.139,1.166,5.9211,0.7987,0.0769,0.306,0.2451,2.2324,0.9777,2.3194,4.9884,2.41,1.3623,4.2569,0.3536,4.0194,0.0085,4.9382,1.0177,4.5011,1.0258,6.1863,0.2257,3.6178,0.7747,2.1293,0.3331,3.4158,5.2581,4.5904,4.686,0.1169,0.8077,1.1876,4.654,3.1148,2.8578,3.1053,3.7571,2.5847,2.2685,1.7124,4.4071,3.2847,3.4153,3.4593,0.7422,9.8914,4.296,1.8354,2.3867,0.7839,0.6449,0.0328,1.2479,0.0228,0.2083,1.5958,1.3287,4.7324,6.2729,0.2129,2.1589,0.342,3.4147,4.6169,1.3748,7.423,1.6454,1.2188,3.38,0.6618,4.0172,0.271,1.5662,0.4258,1.9317,1.3684,5.3562,1.7356,1.6837,1.7242,0.3211,1.467,3.9807,0.7855,3.6963,5.8141,1.4051,0.3182,0.8301,1.8297,2.9365,2.761,0.1463,5.7644,0.2091,3.5164,0.3808,1.4809,3.6269,1.8312,1.0144,0.5128,2.9653,1.6737,4.214,1.2648,4.274,3.7941,3.6515,0.8394,0.7702,2.2262,1.8997,2.7701,4.6533,2.2381,1.2578,1.6188,1.9538,0.973,0.8365,4.2472,0.7214,0.3413,3.6693,0.3252,3.2721,0.6734,0.3884,5.1513,1.829,4.6008,0.342,3.4213,3.5959,1.4268,3.7997,6.847,0.3672,0.1327,1.6267,4.888,0.2261,5.1027,5.0286,3.5556,0.3175]}
{"prompt":"A poem from a serial killer that just wants to be loved","text":"A poem from a serial killer that just wants to be loved by the victims: Love Her So Hard, Laceys.\nThis week the blog has some new readers, which in turn means that there is a new post here every day. See you tomorrow!\nIt\u2019s the last Wednesday of the month so I thought I\u2019d link-up a list of all the songs I played last week. There is no entry for today, as I had a lot to do at work. You can always find a song list or my playlist on my blog, The Shabby Chic Room. You can also check the blogposts for my playlist link to songs played throughout the month. My playlist is going to be uploaded to my soundcloud page the morning of next Wednesday.\nWell, as a writer who has taken some time off from blogging recently, I\u2019ve finally returned to it. This week is the last week of my break from blogging and will end the long series that started over ten years ago on my first blog. In those ten years I have had ten different websites, each of them taking a certain amount of time to create and promote. This has been a huge undertaking for me and I have worked hard at many of them. Many of you have found your way here from the others and so thank you. I have had a lot of pleasure in sharing my thoughts from time to time. I\u2019ve not always been great at following my own advice and taking time off, but these posts are a good indication of my thoughts and have allowed me to share them with you.\nI am now working on the third website, another blog that I share my thoughts with. While writing on this one it has become clear that I don\u2019t know much about the process involved. There are so many choices when you look at making a blog and I wish that it were possible to know everything about every detail. I also wish that I had enough time and energy to make it all happen. There is also work on my website which has been difficult and has taken a long time but I am having to focus more on that to make sure it\u2019s all done at once because I can\u2019t do everything else. There is always more that can be done, but right now I\u2019m just getting started.\nI\u2019m going to put a post on Friday to share the news on the website project. I\u2019m also preparing my schedule for the next year. This is a good year to get things sorted out and in my head, so I can focus on what is important for the rest of my life. Thank you all for staying with me over the years and thank you to all those who have stopped by over the years. I am very grateful to all who have stopped in recently and to those who will continue to do so.\nA poem that is about people suffering who need acceptance and love: Acceptance, by Jennifer Egan.\nA review about a book about a serial killer who wants to be loved from the victims: Love Her So Hard, Laceys.","token_len":633,"entropy":[11.9905,2.9856,2.7078,9.6271,0.2393,3.7212,6.6047,6.5254,0.4961,1.6168,3.841,2.1854,2.6021,5.0087,4.3466,7.931,8.9607,6.8799,2.3223,1.5084,5.9386,5.5648,10.7976,1.6961,1.0063,8.5653,4.3038,3.4529,6.4368,3.5726,5.0277,2.5513,5.9483,1.879,4.6622,5.2267,0.6269,2.8929,1.6017,3.4368,2.0311,1.0322,1.1446,3.8942,4.4557,4.2821,1.2503,0.791,6.0464,0.7045,3.167,0.9309,0.7329,4.8348,15.2792,7.8228,2.1619,3.2416,3.645,6.8419,0.3712,1.3498,0.3488,4.2942,2.1284,2.6233,0.4497,9.2486,0.5949,0.7935,7.453,5.8791,1.5056,2.1635,4.4179,0.1285,2.3627,0.5397,4.7073,1.8135,5.3764,3.1295,0.4539,1.0687,4.3381,2.2701,2.546,7.8159,1.1229,5.2449,1.3514,4.2733,1.1572,3.4271,2.6529,2.3928,2.287,1.272,4.4606,2.1969,1.7536,4.6203,0.5834,4.6371,1.9463,2.694,3.4987,3.5537,4.2943,5.602,3.1873,1.9823,1.4032,2.1307,1.904,5.6251,6.5589,6.1712,8.4903,7.7622,0.6272,4.0201,0.2398,0.9087,2.2273,3.6337,4.2161,7.6443,2.0682,2.8186,4.7013,8.1722,3.4633,5.4357,4.1932,6.396,0.1587,1.9248,0.536,4.9157,0.9112,1.587,6.3021,0.3272,0.4088,5.9399,2.0963,1.7227,8.0193,0.025,3.8383,4.9401,4.0944,0.2344,3.6045,2.454,0.7809,1.3136,5.843,0.4885,4.5047,3.2343,6.6933,2.8308,1.7384,5.6421,3.8578,0.478,1.1789,1.4741,3.1685,5.5132,0.5638,0.3786,4.4707,0.1413,3.6782,4.1718,4.9532,0.642,4.443,0.9127,2.8082,0.7805,3.2759,1.9506,1.5938,1.6417,0.9533,2.8332,5.5633,1.8386,0.6096,1.9883,5.4449,4.4267,4.0677,7.4813,4.0956,3.9909,1.0992,5.254,4.146,0.5394,0.0053,3.9392,2.4153,4.1895,0.5987,0.8167,3.7877,4.0942,1.1014,0.0389,0.9424,0.9196,3.4301,6.2212,1.5656,5.1384,1.7569,5.4739,2.2434,1.956,4.9664,2.0816,5.7485,0.7057,0.0088,0.0455,1.0038,3.4473,1.4281,5.5427,1.5141,3.2637,3.0127,1.1877,1.2358,3.5112,4.1756,1.7223,0.0832,1.5124,0.79,2.3752,4.614,1.1259,3.5857,6.6736,1.5477,0.8323,1.1446,5.2213,0.3808,3.155,1.3394,5.0411,3.1645,1.6103,1.5509,3.5336,2.1295,9.4857,2.2594,5.0573,5.2333,0.0232,2.7594,1.5541,2.0288,3.4141,1.1832,0.7776,0.1587,4.1397,1.4798,3.5636,1.4918,3.4588,5.1204,3.7174,0.0203,0.0003,1.4897,1.5243,3.5631,0.1267,1.6827,4.5891,3.3984,0.7763,4.3462,0.3892,4.8733,2.3415,1.271,4.5983,1.444,5.3902,2.7045,0.8653,2.5937,0.4737,4.6487,4.3791,1.6837,2.4792,2.4293,4.2491,0.5091,2.1422,3.6064,1.1091,4.1036,3.637,0.0744,0.129,3.8036,0.7813,0.5758,0.3177,0.7216,1.2545,1.7983,3.243,4.1415,3.5195,0.3629,2.6589,4.2053,5.4561,1.6799,6.9222,2.4649,1.9466,1.3361,6.7794,3.0707,0.9592,1.2223,2.1492,5.1164,4.5739,4.9394,1.2348,4.0359,4.0526,2.3964,2.0488,2.3554,0.4274,0.8204,3.0321,0.2526,0.3466,0.0378,3.2931,3.0839,0.1021,1.584,5.6811,5.3397,2.4022,3.5304,0.8719,2.932,0.0211,6.8237,4.9102,3.8422,4.1938,0.2056,6.4173,0.912,1.5172,1.6982,2.0085,6.1012,2.5068,3.2618,2.1961,3.2192,0.5251,5.0842,3.523,1.2625,4.1452,4.725,1.0695,1.5988,3.9998,2.4796,0.3079,1.3555,1.6698,5.4177,0.4305,3.9666,1.7985,0.1823,3.1208,2.6271,2.786,1.6704,0.934,3.9201,1.4238,3.5612,5.8702,3.6204,2.419,2.8509,3.402,2.3792,1.161,5.3861,2.3414,3.3039,2.2331,1.0123,1.9092,0.0345,3.6456,1.0245,2.5757,6.4472,4.1922,3.4165,3.2324,0.2153,3.4134,5.349,1.8146,1.9029,1.9161,7.1666,0.0734,0.1081,2.5936,1.0826,4.9973,2.1684,7.2494,1.0991,3.3473,3.6962,0.038,0.0024,2.3386,3.4429,5.6814,1.3233,4.0282,1.1472,4.0856,2.4524,3.6769,2.0111,0.2486,0.2851,1.8962,1.0048,4.8138,0.0063,0.6039,2.4616,0.0227,2.1937,2.4051,3.9606,0.3733,0.506,0.8955,1.5325,3.0067,0.0243,1.261,2.8424,0.2603,4.2394,2.7627,3.8532,1.8684,5.5197,2.798,2.6003,2.5778,3.6334,3.3376,1.3511,2.1186,9.0667,0.9456,1.4281,2.4602,0.0266,0.7001,2.2147,6.5612,3.1432,4.1944,0.9484,1.1216,1.7861,5.5756,1.503,3.3003,1.5888,2.2114,3.1086,6.4234,1.9153,3.0325,2.7734,4.4691,0.5068,1.0808,5.2218,2.8996,1.8143,2.7407,3.0525,1.0636,3.549,1.6848,0.4077,2.2562,1.5735,1.1199,2.3484,1.4144,3.2137,0.0006,1.1489,0.311,0.4319,5.7808,0.0224,2.3159,0.6189,5.5551,0.8059,0.2008,4.3134,0.1017,1.5087,1.1218,4.4167,0.0221,2.1806,1.1117,2.7992,0.2981,0.6728,6.9064,0.097,3.7675,0.2071,0.138,1.09,1.3634,3.2503,3.1303,1.453,1.3793,1.2225,2.2788,0.4225,4.1294,4.0902,6.312,1.2892,2.3369,1.8877,0.2677,5.7393,1.1587,0.1222,3.3892,0.1691,1.0092,1.1782,4.738,5.4125,2.7206,3.0239,3.2275,5.7725,5.3659,6.7988,4.4006,8.1992,1.3527,0.9948,2.1726,9.0528,0.2052,2.6003,7.8827,6.9625,4.9746,3.7329,0.8639,0.6727,3.4509,7.551,3.6636,2.5804,2.9937,2.1035,2.8877,3.8839,0.0866,2.4555,2.1936,0.2466,0.4078,0.0745,7.8691,0.9608,3.1764,0.9178,2.293,0.4978,0.0443,0.0151,0.1999,0.209,0.0107,0.0022,0.2059]}
{"prompt":"A man who has been working in a cubicle for 10 years find a monkeys paw which can grant 5 wishes , but each with a consequence .","text":"A man who has been working in a cubicle for 10 years find a monkeys paw which can grant 5 wishes, but each with a consequence. But isn\u2019t that what love is all about? is it not a consequence of each wish? Is what they thought about her a consequence of the wishes? I want to see how this gets turned into a romantic comedy and I want to see it get a new title, for example \u201cMonks and Monkeys\u201d, \u201cMonkey\u2019s Playpen\u201d or \u201cMonkey\u2019s Meat\u201d or some such like thing, to give it a new sound and it would make it less confusing to audience.\nAll my views above does not mean my films or my choices shouldn\u2019t be respected, but in my opinion most of the time they are the ones who have chosen to misunderstand what I write and that is what I want to correct.\nPosted in Art, Comic, Films, Funny, Humor, Humour, Music\tTagged Comic, Film, Funny, Humor, Humour, movies, Music, songs\nA while ago I gave an interview on another site of mine and I was talking about my music style and about my favorite band of all time, my favorite band of all time is Nirvana, Nirvana is the band who gave me my first taste of grunge, who told me how to dance in my favorite club, who gave me my first ever experience of alcohol consumption and who gave me a taste of reality, Nirvana is the band who told me about love and loneliness, who said I could express myself and who told me to live for the moment, who gave me my first ever experience of love, all of this and more, Nirvana gave me an open mind and a heart that has never been shut, a heart that has been open to the possibility of falling in love, to the possibility of being hurt by a person I love, just like the video shows, this heart can be broken more times that you would think it is possible, in the most impossible of cases, yet again, still in love, but broken again, yet again, this time to the point where I no longer had peace of mind or even my own body, just a shell of the person I once was, to the point where I don\u2019t know myself anymore, a heart that has cried and wept in silence over and over again and that I know it only takes one mistake to have it destroyed again and again, just like the song showcases.\nI will not take it out of their hands but I would like to have more information about the movie and my choice to do so, I\u2019m just asking in a non threatening way.\nThey gave me my first experience of love, who gave me my first experience of love, gave me that freedom, that was when I realized there was more to life more than work and pay bills, then I thought that my life really was much easier, I have the freedom to do what ever I wanted to do and not to worry about what people think or say about me.","token_len":634,"entropy":[7.3022,2.3347,2.925,1.3621,3.841,1.6142,2.5665,6.9678,0.0091,1.5952,4.0655,0.1426,10.5117,2.5021,14.6739,3.4957,5.5405,4.0926,8.7707,9.2728,5.4923,2.4602,2.6885,6.2844,7.4523,1.106,8.4672,2.1405,5.3723,7.7335,17.4972,8.5571,1.2391,2.2172,2.9561,8.1667,0.7251,1.0292,0.0011,0.2257,7.0222,1.7165,3.4219,3.2946,7.9303,0.631,6.9016,1.0632,1.0583,2.8257,5.7627,4.6917,6.7282,2.2981,6.384,3.5899,0.9642,0.1504,2.2057,3.4418,1.411,4.1027,3.6296,0.3641,3.0731,2.6553,2.7363,5.5278,5.5436,0.7004,0.9428,6.8519,3.8448,3.1525,2.4771,0.9113,0.222,0.7144,3.7337,3.3793,2.6239,4.4488,4.7085,2.6328,5.6417,2.7889,4.2148,5.3287,9.5234,4.6856,2.3708,4.1166,0.4428,0.5623,8.3553,3.461,4.0191,0.2224,2.9999,2.6847,2.7328,3.9351,1.9426,7.581,5.7227,1.4256,1.9529,3.3887,1.3426,0.1265,1.3165,0.576,0.4265,0.9487,0.2813,9.2433,3.8482,0.6973,4.2738,5.468,2.2633,5.4071,10.8764,2.4425,4.33,3.7773,1.6583,0.6045,1.2787,7.2824,1.5836,4.9036,2.8396,2.8366,1.8393,4.965,5.1651,2.1914,8.6122,0.9749,1.4586,9.064,4.6461,7.457,6.899,9.108,0.456,1.7969,5.113,8.895,3.4851,2.2028,7.7141,7.2479,4.4611,0.4507,0.4245,0.4238,7.1773,2.1973,1.2561,4.5331,2.077,0.7571,5.3344,1.1186,1.0699,1.5553,2.8595,1.2708,3.9151,2.9678,2.6778,3.3241,5.2712,0.8983,9.6628,2.6718,2.1102,5.8894,1.5286,4.2447,1.5394,1.8431,1.61,2.187,0.5164,6.0698,0.6703,1.299,5.7163,4.2288,7.2188,2.8027,7.636,1.3439,6.5958,0.4369,6.2301,0.9663,5.3624,0.1511,0.5497,4.4386,2.6283,0.6053,5.0533,23.327,7.3303,7.4399,8.5178,1.7925,3.6841,0.902,2.5736,0.2606,0.1379,1.2118,0.1179,0.1168,0.0144,0.1371,11.7843,0.7736,5.1019,1.9652,8.2098,3.3307,4.5883,7.3832,1.2427,0.7464,5.1682,1.7802,0.5433,2.3817,6.9322,1.9885,5.3091,1.4953,2.181,1.6703,2.5286,2.7026,0.3652,2.6759,6.1097,7.1614,1.1808,4.4181,2.4304,4.0809,5.4977,2.6242,1.0789,0.0354,1.4752,4.8593,1.9388,2.8374,0.5392,0.1132,0.0584,4.6285,5.4699,1.6424,4.7679,1.4908,2.021,2.0323,3.4156,4.2834,0.4683,1.5147,0.7197,3.2247,0.0566,5.8699,0.0184,2.0869,5.1037,6.4407,0.092,3.11,1.7467,4.6435,3.2026,2.6457,4.9936,4.5142,1.5036,1.2395,2.2628,0.0337,1.1015,0.1401,6.0155,4.6273,0.773,8.0791,4.8088,1.3685,1.8686,1.3504,0.0277,1.5338,3.2785,0.0767,7.5421,2.55,4.4901,0.9184,0.8916,0.34,0.3795,4.0337,0.0503,2.3974,6.321,1.0636,6.3374,0.9944,1.0773,3.9566,3.2262,2.5627,6.0478,1.3122,3.1469,3.1978,1.9759,0.0255,2.4891,3.8729,4.5799,2.1195,3.0926,1.3357,1.1926,1.6772,0.0256,2.088,0.1122,2.6572,1.5984,0.0426,3.5521,1.4818,5.7101,1.2184,1.9583,3.6199,0.857,1.997,4.3288,4.4383,0.0444,2.8311,6.0657,0.5222,0.9484,2.0202,4.2117,1.7538,4.411,2.3296,0.7092,4.9689,4.096,3.8842,1.6113,0.143,1.515,3.2178,1.9285,1.0948,2.6116,3.0688,0.4697,7.9118,0.5099,0.0044,1.2973,3.0732,2.7443,0.8854,0.1611,2.2356,7.4784,2.2904,2.3152,2.7422,4.8619,1.2349,0.9325,5.9125,1.6306,2.6874,7.8645,4.5641,1.946,3.8718,3.5958,4.2837,1.6675,2.9936,7.6988,3.743,4.7566,2.3148,3.2616,1.0832,3.0856,3.0151,4.9348,1.3562,4.4348,1.935,4.5878,7.4834,2.2549,4.4969,1.0406,6.165,5.1028,0.8834,6.1688,3.2296,3.5954,1.3725,3.4201,7.2382,3.0417,1.0802,2.9063,0.151,0.4716,4.1725,5.1367,3.6838,1.4547,2.4369,0.7194,2.8446,6.4229,0.009,5.8016,8.0728,1.5041,0.01,2.9309,3.319,4.5256,2.4847,3.0561,1.2133,4.206,2.251,6.8596,0.626,2.8173,3.0693,0.4765,2.322,0.6903,0.7156,4.4438,0.8094,0.2485,0.3253,0.5951,4.6657,1.0304,0.1999,0.1109,1.7849,5.778,1.1643,0.8222,5.1138,5.1086,0.4746,1.6585,6.9795,2.7907,5.0698,2.4536,3.7814,3.8152,5.9808,3.3278,0.0209,0.4964,2.4064,3.5984,2.2096,4.1277,3.2106,5.9981,6.4896,1.6029,6.1922,1.2927,4.5889,2.2406,6.7574,3.7093,2.0363,0.5317,0.9744,4.0046,0.331,0.9085,5.9379,9.4531,1.8942,0.6914,2.4151,3.9959,2.2976,4.4564,2.8501,4.7328,0.3314,6.5188,0.4015,3.5365,1.0461,3.6932,0.4991,0.1397,4.2241,4.0866,3.2468,0.9885,1.9856,4.6371,1.6479,3.7639,4.9598,1.8963,2.8924,1.4176,1.4944,2.0897,6.9055,0.2231,0.858,4.5833,3.1395,5.5549,2.8444,5.7309,6.9268,0.4416,2.0583,0.9766,6.0903,3.5746,0.3239,2.6679,0.2354,2.6526,0.2238,0.9407,1.162,5.3758,1.2818,0.0247,0.8162,0.0183,1.0019,0.0198,1.0999,0.6774,5.4451,0.0195,5.4403,7.1033,1.4425,3.443,4.7733,5.4077,0.3895,3.841,4.3287,0.5494,3.0707,0.7068,1.4359,9.6889,0.3112,7.5818,1.1933,8.1188,5.957,0.8101,5.899,1.593,4.1962,2.5774,3.5754,1.8117,5.9515,0.7672,5.3528,3.863,1.6931,1.7344,5.3084,4.2236,1.002,0.592,2.2631,0.9782,6.0809,0.3521,2.5139,1.2889,0.3815,1.3645,4.5793,4.5458,2.0517,0.2612,2.2176,2.0986,0.8939,2.1887,2.9622,1.7398,0.415,1.5758]}
{"prompt":"You 've occasionally seen groups of strangely dressed people taking pictures and pointing at you . One day you confront one of them , who tells you he 's a tourist from the future where a company allows tourists to go back in time and observe great historical figures before they become famous .","text":"You've occasionally seen groups of strangely dressed people taking pictures and pointing at you. One day you confront one of them, who tells you he's a tourist from the future where a company allows tourists to go back in time and observe great historical figures before they become famous. You are taken back and shown the history of the great man.\nAt the end you are given a time machine, a picture of your dead loved one and you are shown the image of life before the incident. What you see is heartbreaking, but as soon as you open the time machine -the picture freezes and you are not allowed to close the image. A second later you are back in the picture with your loved one and you go back with her\nWhen you open the time machine you see yourself as a kid watching your mother prepare for her death. You cry and she is not there, no one is there to care about you and you wake up.\nIt goes on like this for hundreds of people, all of them in this family for generations.\nYour grandfather, a farmer has been visited by his ancestor at night when he was a kid, the two tell stories from the past and get drunk.\nOne night the father gets in his car to go to work, an accident takes place and his son dies of course.\nThe son of the father is a brilliant physicist, his mother was a doctor and one day they get their grandchildren up at night to tell stories about their time in the future, they have the time machine too but they only use it when their children are small, they will make the trip back when the children are older as a reward. The grandchildren come from a different time to the future and live in a different country, they visit their grandfathers as well.\nAnother time the husband of the daughter goes to work and when he comes back her husband is dead! She meets her future husband when he is young and they marry.\nOne day she goes on a trip and arrives the same day in the future, her daughter visits her in the future, visits her again in the future and then they come back in the time machine when their daughter is growing up.\nThe daughter becomes a young mother and then they visit her grandchildren.\nI think that all of this is a warning that humanity is coming to an end. We will all change and be replaced by machines and robot's. It is in the spirit of science fiction because technology is already advancing too quickly.\nWe are all going to die off and then there will be a new creation.\nThe picture I want to refer to is one taken by an astronaut on the return trip to the earth during a space mission, this astronaut is taken back to our time by our ancestors.\nThey show him a picture of himself when he was a baby and a picture of his future as an astronaut, they show him the space ships where he was to go to the moon during that time.\nWe in our time only know the beginning.\nDuring the war we heard about the time machine that was kept a secret by the Japanese. We also had contact with this people from a different time.","token_len":635,"entropy":[5.5189,10.3677,2.2184,7.2161,0.4063,10.6783,2.0159,1.8375,5.2383,2.6869,2.7349,6.6826,1.7075,2.9911,1.5408,4.4697,4.3509,2.2904,9.0907,3.3133,0.2612,0.5954,1.6306,3.2336,3.9681,0.0197,2.0248,0.804,1.505,5.7834,2.3345,2.4991,5.3442,6.3621,3.9931,6.7307,7.6717,2.9599,0.1757,4.2387,4.5974,0.5743,0.0405,1.5759,6.431,7.6056,3.634,3.228,5.3458,1.2206,4.7572,2.1953,0.3429,2.0847,4.5192,5.0046,2.5913,4.6324,4.0522,1.4893,3.5369,0.5615,0.9223,5.7364,3.1543,1.8251,2.2202,10.793,1.4007,0.8021,3.3574,1.9942,2.3796,0.7613,6.5383,1.9899,2.0975,3.0134,4.3998,0.6009,2.9069,5.7601,3.1163,0.5897,1.1982,2.3952,1.8951,3.6822,1.1217,4.9136,0.4226,8.1137,3.1665,1.3168,7.4118,0.5357,4.4108,2.1764,1.114,0.7516,9.0513,1.6902,1.0963,4.9274,2.3847,0.014,0.2615,3.9466,0.6161,2.6604,0.1305,6.8917,7.7843,1.8669,7.2387,1.7083,0.6984,1.7539,3.9967,1.2692,0.1822,5.4677,1.8512,5.0363,0.9665,4.7965,4.9484,5.9016,0.8996,1.2026,5.2275,0.9135,1.2018,3.1394,3.3127,1.3332,1.2156,0.077,1.3931,1.4102,5.142,0.9246,4.3956,4.5741,7.4236,4.1115,0.7219,3.6223,0.2305,1.2333,0.0287,1.8786,1.5501,5.0464,2.436,1.0733,6.3081,4.6867,2.5588,3.3286,8.1577,1.6449,1.5375,5.2546,0.569,1.3996,7.0177,1.5765,4.1748,3.0446,3.9279,2.4796,2.09,5.886,0.8918,1.5106,1.5096,1.6664,4.7493,2.7602,0.3212,2.3539,0.798,6.4691,0.0392,3.2488,1.4597,3.5975,5.5284,0.2088,3.1547,0.2509,1.0493,5.5946,0.0785,4.7142,2.1173,3.8135,1.3394,0.7021,3.4629,3.6071,5.8747,4.9704,3.5247,0.5588,1.7841,4.6779,5.0745,2.4523,2.161,3.2084,6.3457,1.7356,7.3763,0.5482,2.521,6.5049,4.8471,4.2979,3.9231,0.661,1.7251,2.4042,2.8369,2.0947,4.0535,4.5786,6.6569,3.7971,4.3318,1.3323,0.6331,1.9215,5.2212,5.1133,1.6645,2.1417,3.8289,3.1499,2.1965,2.8858,3.9749,3.5897,1.1547,0.2282,2.9321,2.5592,1.0838,1.6882,1.8642,6.0261,3.9998,2.7191,0.1514,1.2008,2.7432,3.4115,2.4366,3.169,7.9813,0.4451,1.1453,1.7248,4.1877,2.6323,1.0366,1.7218,1.5654,2.298,6.2671,4.0447,1.4019,3.1284,3.1803,3.3508,0.7327,3.1465,1.1686,4.4875,0.6645,4.0286,3.0148,5.0087,5.7966,6.3155,2.6337,0.8438,1.1002,4.55,2.3564,1.4358,1.2464,4.0837,1.5653,0.652,1.9682,2.5552,2.6172,3.1326,3.9645,4.1451,0.0975,6.1947,3.3597,1.5776,4.4053,4.1595,0.371,2.0214,3.2649,2.9571,0.5326,7.6517,2.1601,1.742,5.0698,5.2432,2.861,4.6272,1.9961,3.8314,2.1088,2.6319,0.5607,1.5378,5.9994,2.6292,5.6579,1.0666,2.768,4.0482,3.9943,3.9052,2.5373,1.8742,2.1021,4.3282,1.1118,3.4648,1.2372,5.6458,1.3663,1.6634,0.6005,2.8381,1.6891,1.9284,5.9269,1.8107,1.9286,3.8488,4.6484,2.6853,1.3685,0.5884,4.9903,1.1298,1.5644,6.1319,1.496,0.5949,4.3131,3.3622,0.3607,1.8157,1.4269,3.5884,0.7803,2.2506,0.9509,8.171,2.9957,1.2843,2.6739,6.6951,3.0232,5.6211,1.4008,3.8737,0.3822,3.9191,0.9867,0.9983,2.926,0.5748,1.7527,4.0651,1.2116,1.1045,3.6191,0.4077,2.8345,2.8719,3.9934,0.6767,1.7489,1.8457,6.7283,5.9361,3.1142,0.5424,4.6033,1.1539,1.0427,1.7464,2.5865,3.8821,5.8729,0.7383,3.4787,0.5843,0.4621,1.8191,8.2076,0.3412,3.9332,1.7265,0.0673,0.2149,0.8543,3.1529,2.7049,3.8862,0.3476,2.692,0.2543,5.7208,0.0474,4.761,2.9547,1.3488,0.7568,6.3442,0.3002,0.6801,0.6596,1.7242,2.477,6.6949,1.117,5.2823,4.4084,0.8107,3.5958,2.9089,3.9409,1.0421,4.6167,1.9279,0.9867,4.8667,2.9278,2.2971,4.0013,0.9381,1.2271,0.9686,2.5257,6.338,2.3632,6.1258,0.8764,3.6775,0.287,0.4662,0.0429,0.8279,2.0857,2.6957,2.1786,6.7104,1.8379,3.9526,2.5404,0.5017,1.9903,2.2052,8.661,5.3326,1.0741,3.2051,1.01,5.1647,1.8183,4.8932,0.0347,4.566,0.9464,7.9132,4.9563,1.2103,4.5279,5.4086,5.6573,2.3149,1.2247,1.0522,3.2113,1.4005,2.5951,2.3918,0.3843,2.5945,5.4759,2.1075,3.8152,3.0357,0.4513,0.2002,1.6141,1.6444,5.8321,1.7143,1.17,2.733,6.3474,3.2961,3.3825,0.4974,8.8032,0.2222,0.3375,3.6431,4.3609,1.1667,3.39,3.8565,2.3395,1.2705,6.2826,1.8147,0.9626,1.3951,5.0517,4.9404,2.1108,2.471,1.2165,2.7934,3.1587,2.0652,1.3582,4.6396,2.5681,0.795,4.6162,3.4323,2.4471,4.0443,4.1019,1.3391,1.0831,4.1361,5.0765,1.9033,2.1427,0.7317,0.1952,4.4757,5.4014,0.4153,0.6935,0.5831,3.4375,1.1989,4.1144,0.8783,0.0792,0.9187,2.5392,4.1739,2.0214,0.1537,1.592,3.0229,1.8778,0.2943,1.8538,4.5311,6.456,4.7313,1.0003,1.5317,5.2763,2.1258,1.5826,2.6518,0.7339,4.7133,4.5274,1.0629,1.0479,0.6038,3.3559,7.0132,2.513,1.624,7.4271,2.7044,2.0595,5.0169,2.8421,1.1487,6.3108,0.9195,4.6741,2.2356,5.6826,1.7118,0.8776,4.3042,0.5071,2.8272,1.4862,7.1542,5.6362,0.374,2.2877,0.6726,4.3254,1.6474,2.5219,2.889,4.0572,6.3419,0.1096,4.1411,7.0335,3.4653,3.3001,3.0728,0.2175,1.9077]}
{"prompt":"In the future , weed is legal . Write a Stoner 's Anonymous meeting .","text":"In the future, weed is legal. Write a Stoner's Anonymous meeting. In the U.S. of the legalization cannabis sativa which has been banned since 1914 and the growing of marijuana is a legal business. Marijuana plant, which is grown under strict conditions and after planting is subject to strict supervision. In some states to be sold only and it is prohibited to sell to people under the age of 21.\nIt is estimated that in 2019 has increased the production of cannabis by 40%. In addition to the increase in the number of plants growing, is also observed how much more people in the world, is smoking cannabis and the increasing number of its products such as beer or bread.\nIn many countries in the world, the legalization of cannabis has not had the result desired. In many cases, marijuana users are arrested for marijuana possession at the age of 17 and if the police catch them with 20 plants or greater they are considered habitual, and are considered to be in jail for a long time.\nIt is a good thing, for many countries, are looking to have legalized cannabis. In these places, many states where marijuana has been legalized, as a way to make money. As for example, the people of California, they have begun to grow cannabis on a large scale for the sale of coffee in many coffee shops in the West, have found a profitable market.\nBut in countries where it has been lawful, there are still many cases of corruption, where officials abuse of law. According to media reports, at least in Canada and Europe has occurred, although less than in the United States, where it is more common.\nMarijuana is one of the most widely used narcotics and drugs. In many cases, there is even no difference between recreational and medical uses. It is not known very well why users prefer cannabis.\nI have decided to devote my time and skills to give back to the community, and assist in bringing about change in an effort to encourage compassion and understanding.\nI believe that the world could be a better place if everyone were to realize that one person is not a problem, but instead how they interact with that one. Therefore my goal is to encourage that spirit of giving back, that generosity that comes from sharing what you have with what you need.\nI am a child of the military. My mother served in many different countries in the United Nations, and I remember being so proud knowing that she was serving in her country. I thank her every day for being an advocate for those in need. I feel blessed that my parents gave me the best life and that they gave me the opportunity to travel and explore the world. I am grateful to be the daughter of someone who served in her country and that I had the opportunity to share the beauty of our world with her.\nI have always felt that I had a duty to give back to my community. As I get older I have had the opportunity to help my community, by volunteering at shelters and schools when I know that other children are in need. I have been an advocate for those with disabilities during the week, by making them aware of the opportunities available to them.","token_len":635,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5008,0.2783,12.7803,2.6153,6.1721,2.9594,11.32,2.0343,10.3328,2.1429,3.6828,7.0061,9.1813,2.1588,5.2328,0.5225,5.8985,0.0029,0.1101,1.6054,5.2619,6.2634,10.5041,9.1078,8.1272,0.0273,6.9511,2.3741,0.9072,4.6296,2.9175,7.7783,3.1168,3.0383,4.9533,0.7585,2.5182,3.4639,3.4919,3.0608,3.8656,2.0206,4.8392,6.6088,3.7092,3.0575,0.9598,2.6837,4.0458,3.2468,1.6972,1.8875,7.3533,6.4342,2.6545,5.6307,0.021,2.6342,4.2387,1.2105,3.1632,3.938,2.0244,6.0353,3.0449,3.3698,3.5947,5.4692,5.6762,0.5469,3.7965,0.4796,1.8013,2.077,3.3881,0.8363,1.3933,0.0463,0.0215,1.1989,0.3479,1.7904,9.3326,0.5668,4.1205,0.2493,3.0346,6.7836,9.3187,4.9042,2.3357,4.8041,0.4006,2.1483,2.1752,3.6297,1.6439,2.5948,4.0413,1.4882,1.6538,3.4542,0.5901,1.6968,1.9704,0.034,1.5934,2.6775,1.6659,6.7347,1.9551,6.7735,6.7242,2.9928,2.7388,3.6395,3.3751,0.9577,2.8098,3.629,3.7877,4.1189,1.6956,2.5944,2.6813,4.7249,1.7999,0.0457,6.2645,2.4913,4.9725,0.0278,5.7013,3.9302,8.7154,0.7283,1.1059,2.6662,4.7909,0.7038,3.4571,0.5084,0.2593,1.1343,1.9814,3.6142,0.3187,0.8894,2.3163,2.9293,4.5638,2.5742,5.1213,3.4004,1.4305,1.9249,2.5087,3.2955,0.7942,4.6148,5.6061,1.4272,4.581,2.1169,3.4276,1.0612,5.3679,1.3151,4.5176,0.0242,2.8949,1.971,5.2158,2.7506,2.9121,4.8936,1.1667,4.2465,6.7675,5.6631,2.6392,5.1441,2.5376,0.7325,5.1918,7.0915,5.4797,2.7955,2.8421,4.4188,1.6789,0.5117,2.9608,5.3029,0.9182,1.6976,1.7123,0.6179,0.2844,1.1686,3.4758,0.3205,3.6884,3.2011,2.4048,3.4295,2.8689,3.3366,3.1684,0.9579,6.6268,4.5956,1.6079,4.5467,3.1294,1.5202,1.5616,2.2214,4.8996,4.1388,0.674,4.0412,4.1681,5.6149,2.4121,2.4937,0.4646,0.5625,1.3286,5.2372,2.9071,2.2338,0.5825,3.1974,2.3971,2.4437,4.933,3.0369,7.1585,0.44,2.5863,5.9095,1.0783,3.6654,1.3771,4.667,1.6033,6.7918,0.5305,2.7656,2.4049,3.8494,2.942,1.9586,0.0705,4.1124,1.7978,6.1133,0.4839,4.8,3.6228,3.5982,3.6142,0.1185,2.2367,0.9657,6.7699,2.03,6.3871,5.8784,2.1391,5.3309,3.3729,2.7706,1.1789,4.6357,2.4995,4.2942,1.6156,2.0528,1.2595,0.6449,7.9842,0.8819,2.857,0.8679,2.68,2.0305,4.088,1.5029,6.4414,1.7506,3.8148,5.2588,6.3488,5.745,5.8999,2.0454,5.1607,0.0026,6.8123,0.2411,0.4372,4.9952,0.4944,4.5713,5.1369,2.4394,5.0717,8.1895,7.6056,2.4959,6.1948,6.71,2.0208,1.3652,0.7928,1.5265,0.0119,1.6363,1.0459,2.4804,0.8015,5.0046,1.5719,0.9776,0.9496,5.0222,0.0457,1.1034,4.418,0.1313,0.2142,0.9287,3.1151,0.4708,3.894,2.1771,4.8441,2.4223,2.4251,2.6308,2.418,0.5892,3.5288,0.9639,4.2337,5.6748,4.8906,0.6756,5.4297,0.4005,3.0407,3.3349,0.7985,2.7572,0.286,3.0158,3.9945,7.6819,1.4427,3.9234,6.3584,4.2747,3.5317,2.0382,1.3259,4.7818,2.0622,5.5983,0.2039,7.008,1.3882,1.7267,1.7229,6.9042,0.2683,7.3658,3.3529,0.2891,0.9621,1.834,2.1965,2.1945,7.4903,1.7005,5.0581,2.0524,2.808,1.1041,6.5823,3.7586,0.1987,6.1342,7.4445,0.9897,2.4957,1.6979,1.0561,1.8353,3.36,0.5503,1.9765,3.6549,5.229,1.0733,1.5779,0.3131,0.0655,0.6861,3.8482,3.5445,1.2479,4.4723,0.5348,5.0816,2.5579,2.1539,2.2664,2.3742,4.2183,1.5961,2.3057,3.9211,6.1835,3.5822,4.9943,0.307,5.5116,3.1341,2.887,4.8388,5.3283,2.3683,0.2966,0.2226,4.1685,4.6838,6.5152,0.6665,4.4027,1.1751,2.1251,2.6506,6.2122,3.4323,4.0845,0.4563,3.8081,4.3889,0.9859,1.1192,2.5074,7.8987,0.4743,3.6407,0.7476,0.7827,1.6481,2.0262,2.1733,7.1352,0.9329,1.6534,7.5622,1.9342,2.3248,2.3346,3.4928,0.6663,4.7092,2.1171,2.1963,2.2677,0.7687,4.494,3.8065,1.4581,1.5429,1.6043,4.1344,3.2408,4.3872,1.3005,8.4387,0.5708,1.8348,1.3264,4.3517,1.4673,3.7244,0.5695,0.7002,1.5545,5.7387,1.9288,3.3075,0.3671,1.0401,3.6831,3.7627,3.6399,0.5132,3.8128,2.6618,0.4869,0.806,1.5381,3.9945,4.3202,1.6537,2.4809,3.3138,4.2697,0.6391,1.2755,5.2112,2.6552,2.8185,2.0468,1.6996,2.2841,0.1769,0.7155,2.6762,0.1534,6.3069,2.2583,4.601,1.5375,0.363,0.853,1.3632,2.074,2.0656,1.3401,3.0493,4.5423,3.9717,0.1673,4.0309,0.4172,5.0308,1.4724,5.2057,0.2116,1.3083,3.683,1.6275,4.5071,0.8356,0.481,0.0428,3.1413,2.4051,4.6263,0.5705,3.0457,3.2898,0.5153,2.3365,0.2936,0.6704,1.0895,2.563,3.1315,2.4029,0.6661,1.9838,2.5293,1.6493,2.2021,0.3797,3.0193,0.1608,0.5567,2.2993,1.5212,0.9356,3.8388,1.7308,5.2749,0.0876,1.8803,3.2538,4.5213,2.2946,0.7392,0.0539,3.6468,3.2193,1.3321,2.1779,4.5848,3.7519,2.7354,5.7655,1.1852,4.0245,7.2612,1.1262,5.8147,1.4174,4.9752,3.3279,1.4969,3.0304,0.3631,0.9033,0.8216,1.2026,2.3003,4.1104,0.7334,0.2075,2.7974,3.8745,1.5389,6.0752,1.7813,8.4594,1.4793,3.4364,4.0146,3.2725,3.0901,0.3158,1.0851,4.0559,1.821,0.9289,0.3727,1.1346]}
{"prompt":"( WP ) Lucifer never fell , God just needed his most trusted archangel to claim the darkness so the real evil could not .","text":"( WP ) Lucifer never fell, God just needed his most trusted archangel to claim the darkness so the real evil could not. Lucifer himself may not have actually created evil, but he certainly helped in keeping it alive as he did not want to be left and alone.\nI know you have some great opinions, but I don't think they go well with the fact that you have a high view of yourself. Why do you think you are better than you are? That will certainly affect the opinions you have as the world looks at your actions & their implications. If you are a Christian, you can hardly hold it against the devil, but if you think of yourself as a bad person then its hard for someone else to have an open perspective on something if it's negative.\nForget everything you know about the fall of man and assume man was created good (as it says in scripture). And then try to see how Lucifer came to be a fallen angel and how that affected earth.\nWhy so quick to call people Christian? I think you are giving a biased and general idea about Christians. It doesn't matter which religion is right. The truth is always right.\nIn fact, I didn't even believe you were a Christian a few years back when you came here and did this post. I just didn't know what your Christian beliefs were. Now I know. I don't think you are a Christian in the way you define it. But you are a Christian. You have a personal relationship with Jesus. You are a follower of Jesus through faith.\nI think there is more to being a Christian than just that. Your religion may not define you as a Christian. Maybe you are an atheist or agnostic. Maybe your religious beliefs are not even relevant to your character or actions.\nI disagree with Christian's views on many points, but you are right. We should not judge others by their religious beliefs. That is an easy way to offend people. You, I don't know. Maybe. It would be wrong of me to comment on my personal beliefs. But I think it is easy to do this on this board. I am sure others will agree. I don't see my comments as a threat to anyone.\nIt is easy to offend people. I can tell you that. It is easy to make them mad, too. No matter what my religion is, I would find it hard to offend a person like that. But that doesn't make it right. It is easy to say the opposite. We can say that we are Christians but do wrong things all the time. You would assume this doesn't matter to a Christian.\nNo, I don't suppose it does. I was never going to be a Christian, and that post was merely to prove to myself how the bible says a fallen angel could become a human being, but I chose to change my mind. I could easily pick up on sarcasm or ignorance and then pick a thread that made me think \"how could they?\" I couldn't see a reason to believe in anything other than the truth, so I decided not to put up with it anymore.","token_len":635,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,16.7623,9.9665,5.935,1.8745,6.0524,5.2573,5.9362,3.7002,6.8858,3.0315,8.0022,1.1275,0.7183,7.5085,1.8413,8.1197,4.9933,4.1501,6.637,4.5555,0.732,3.4459,5.594,2.6004,4.5437,5.8482,2.062,0.6576,4.8924,5.6755,5.346,0.6279,0.2436,0.8312,3.0626,4.3346,4.7691,4.9864,1.7233,4.4557,4.0282,1.9738,2.7361,4.8441,2.3153,0.9383,2.1093,4.5975,7.4481,3.4315,0.9665,1.653,5.4215,3.5044,2.9717,2.5947,3.6903,4.7001,5.4906,2.3172,0.6001,1.1171,3.4379,0.0013,0.9381,4.502,5.5759,3.0374,0.5179,1.8814,5.7113,0.0783,2.4808,2.5142,2.308,6.0276,6.4147,0.1179,4.4445,1.1735,5.3959,1.9204,0.1637,0.6221,1.6263,1.8123,4.9948,0.8012,3.9595,2.1253,0.5062,5.2624,5.4567,4.8047,3.0656,2.3409,4.2855,1.0756,1.2825,3.3576,4.5343,3.6457,4.3528,1.6209,2.9712,2.0767,9.0435,4.6149,3.2121,0.3556,3.3544,0.5436,1.5939,2.5362,4.4254,1.0243,1.3715,3.3037,7.0659,5.0419,3.8383,0.1997,2.7668,2.551,1.9503,1.3184,1.0505,0.1693,4.5347,3.6062,1.1298,0.1856,0.9116,5.6053,0.4141,2.7534,6.8786,2.9064,2.3654,5.3161,2.8949,0.162,4.3522,3.19,5.4492,6.2548,1.2083,5.1062,5.8876,2.9281,2.3874,5.4358,0.4093,1.5935,4.4567,4.2091,4.2789,0.9871,2.0269,0.3463,1.9492,7.3751,0.3815,4.7592,2.2929,6.2521,5.8731,1.5118,1.5646,6.7283,4.1848,3.8553,3.4542,4.657,0.3833,4.9003,0.9163,5.1736,3.5471,4.0238,0.4031,3.5171,1.9931,5.1939,3.7592,0.2258,1.0071,3.7521,6.1356,1.4055,2.5079,1.9276,3.1718,3.2995,8.8239,1.6021,1.5603,5.0137,6.2682,5.8384,0.4794,4.2201,4.3777,7.9537,1.1894,2.9401,2.1861,2.3927,1.5936,5.5003,2.0617,5.8469,3.3634,7.1988,3.9879,2.6545,4.6965,0.7325,3.2812,3.3474,0.0008,1.5692,3.6562,1.6905,3.565,2.8549,2.1769,2.7887,3.282,0.3425,6.0997,4.1876,0.8215,1.8718,4.4617,2.0412,0.6084,1.7596,6.0872,0.0008,1.8091,4.1368,2.9616,2.3824,1.6455,0.1632,6.3349,1.6703,0.2841,1.5153,1.7266,0.8679,4.7924,4.7611,2.2138,4.7446,3.07,3.8294,0.8824,1.4385,3.2645,3.5591,0.0012,2.5203,1.4939,4.8905,5.8166,1.0879,0.2865,0.9802,4.3141,1.4023,1.2023,3.2389,1.8496,3.2615,0.0007,2.2847,0.8179,1.1975,1.4211,0.5556,4.3435,1.0565,1.997,0.9422,6.5408,2.5184,0.5927,2.83,1.9223,1.1568,1.1961,1.1145,1.7549,2.2501,2.4503,1.8058,4.9477,3.641,0.406,2.5917,2.5633,1.1628,1.8373,1.4251,5.0013,0.1255,1.3581,5.6931,3.1735,0.953,2.0777,2.0847,2.6254,4.0322,0.7299,3.1762,0.4886,4.4156,0.1684,0.0903,0.1397,1.5172,4.0033,0.4789,5.0834,4.3715,3.5765,1.4752,5.7393,0.3455,1.5475,0.2785,0.3724,1.5882,3.9419,1.0088,1.1747,3.4261,0.9219,1.5576,2.1367,0.0227,1.0654,0.7314,2.9572,3.2403,0.585,1.0385,2.2541,4.8545,4.6804,0.5156,1.1424,5.2382,2.031,4.7939,0.2988,2.7206,1.8961,7.0092,0.5738,6.833,3.9771,4.1009,0.9677,3.6961,3.975,1.8244,0.4909,3.6576,1.4136,2.9716,1.4123,4.4268,3.1156,1.5199,2.8634,2.2597,2.8633,1.5417,3.0468,0.2956,0.5106,3.7955,0.8741,4.4612,3.8796,0.887,0.2369,5.9807,1.491,0.6077,2.951,6.6629,4.0063,3.0829,0.0008,1.6747,2.078,3.6057,5.1234,3.5321,2.9018,0.4562,4.617,2.5793,0.8019,0.2055,5.8981,0.3791,4.36,2.5938,0.9606,1.2076,1.687,1.0001,1.952,1.892,0.7325,5.4552,0.3939,3.4882,4.1137,3.7824,3.2813,5.407,0.9188,2.0858,2.2331,2.8773,4.3259,1.4311,2.4398,1.1183,2.163,2.6137,0.0009,3.893,5.0011,4.11,1.3687,2.379,2.7426,0.5651,2.7086,1.1897,1.7663,4.0593,0.8809,2.9772,0.2707,2.4555,0.6975,1.4887,1.9661,3.6212,2.8562,0.1664,1.1186,2.4486,2.7819,0.6644,1.2305,0.2937,3.0995,4.4924,4.1524,2.4906,5.4284,0.111,5.4049,1.6286,0.9021,4.9488,3.7477,0.6981,0.6385,0.82,3.9128,5.6508,0.8274,1.7244,0.2065,2.869,3.6594,1.3309,4.4354,2.3932,0.2536,2.7121,3.012,1.3883,0.0008,2.8928,1.2145,2.6452,0.5967,2.204,1.4812,2.2961,0.2206,3.7421,4.2497,3.7012,0.6517,4.1586,2.1184,3.7112,1.9109,2.0648,1.3089,3.6821,2.869,6.2771,6.9392,1.3587,5.848,0.0768,0.0118,0.2176,3.8676,4.3589,6.9749,3.3483,5.2017,0.0007,1.8323,1.5924,4.1222,1.4613,0.5989,1.5564,5.2323,1.2366,0.9901,1.1961,0.0006,7.7658,1.6896,0.3135,0.2157,1.2327,5.0062,3.471,3.5058,0.0093,2.2238,1.1063,0.2912,2.5189,2.2414,3.2011,8.723,1.7649,6.2936,3.3884,3.9612,2.9598,2.6739,3.4171,4.9856,2.9738,2.8498,4.1345,8.3759,0.4615,2.7918,4.8471,0.3865,4.2446,0.2895,3.2876,1.8086,0.9891,7.1672,0.2924,6.212,0.4149,1.3654,0.985,1.0783,5.1229,4.5332,7.6649,1.1436,1.608,10.9977,0.0065,3.1888,4.3769,1.818,3.9233,6.1002,4.489,5.2202,2.5356,4.0065,1.0254,2.6655,4.2032,4.6875,1.5448,3.4531,3.524,2.2819,4.8552,0.0005,4.0132,3.4305,1.9032,0.7722,2.8912,2.473,3.3439,2.2795,0.0068,1.7817,2.9085,3.1441,1.9228,0.2438,1.9409,4.1336,0.0011,5.1322,2.0847,0.5363,0.9808,3.6228,0.1181]}

But I think I had it right. I think this story is not an isolated case.\n\"Heaps of us are in the same boat. Sometimes we can't even talk to people anymore. The worst part is... our friends think we need to change our lifestyle to be accepted. The sad truth is that we are still the same person. And we are also still a person we wanted to be.

She shared: \"I feel so ashamed and guilty now. My father has said I didn't know I could do this to myself. People still wonder why I'm doing this (drug use).\n\"But I can't change my past. We all have a past. We are all flawed. We are all human. This is my reality. This is us.

{"prompt":"A person undergoes a new medical procedure where their mind is temporarily transplanted into a computer . The patient `` awakes '' to see a solitary human being reactivating the hospital computers in an almost unrecognizably desolate world ...","text":"A person undergoes a new medical procedure where their mind is temporarily transplanted into a computer. The patient `` awakes '' to see a solitary human being reactivating the hospital computers in an almost unrecognizably desolate world... The narrator tells his wife about the procedure. He describes the doctor, the nurses, the medical equipment. He expresses his relief at being relieved of himself. He tells the story in an unusually detailed and personal style. The wife is present, and she recognizes her husband not only at the end, but throughout the narrative.\nA man, a father, a citizen, has no business being here. We say no war, no killings, no destruction... But is that a way of looking after these children and these children of the future? A father is a father.\nA new system, one that is all automatic, takes over the management of the whole human race at the end of the twentieth century. The human race lives in permanent confinement, but the technology that creates this life of ease, comfort, and security has the capacity to make its own existence meaningless.\nWhat makes this story about the fate of human civilization, or about the fate of us humans, is that the ending is not so much that the machines kill us, that the machines take back what we gave them, that the machines take what we have been given. The ending is about humanity becoming a little weirder and a little less normal.\nEvery person who enters a room when you are alive is dead in some way by the time you leave. You may walk on them when you are awake; as soon as you put your foot on the first dead body you see how they look. Even a few moments of sleep while being moved do not help with this.\nIn a long life, I knew quite a few people who were in a position to be able to decide the fate of many other human beings ; they made mistakes.\nI have always read this as a prophecy of the end of the United Nations. At least the part about the machines killing the world (I have looked at the second part though) is hard to believe because the human race is the primary technology being developed, while killing itself is only a secondary concern. The human being is in essence a technology; all that is needed is for that technology to become more advanced so that there is no place for a human being.\nThe first time that I found out about this picture was one year ago, from one of my English Lit teachers. This is in the context of discussing the question of whether to use the past versus the present tense to describe the lives of our characters.\nThe problem with the use of the past tense here is that the present tense speaks of a time when humans are free to kill, a time of absolute lawlessness. If the use of the past tense was appropriate in this context, then the man in that room that you saw moving in your sleep would not be alive in the present. On the other hand, if the man in that room was actually alive as you watched his body move in your sleep -then the use of the past tense would be appropriate.","token_len":636,"entropy":[7.6763,11.0223,0.0115,1.3717,6.2326,2.5619,1.7203,6.2914,3.7238,6.4611,0.6281,4.6596,7.5173,0.0011,1.129,0.9901,4.5327,2.2575,1.6825,3.5887,14.6004,12.9486,2.6247,5.1146,2.4079,3.6386,1.8031,13.3001,4.0356,1.7698,11.6874,4.0215,1.4935,8.9722,6.3466,3.1561,2.9694,3.9383,5.693,5.6964,0.0898,9.2669,3.2472,5.6762,2.5655,7.9659,3.8814,3.2634,5.3806,2.701,0.8003,5.9095,1.7526,2.3304,3.392,1.2834,5.4779,2.4556,2.2742,4.4754,0.3077,0.8486,3.909,4.2943,2.572,1.2058,6.3415,1.1619,4.7008,1.6732,2.6732,6.0986,1.2454,6.5117,1.4882,1.3177,2.9706,1.4866,1.4399,3.3099,3.1418,5.0547,5.0445,1.6581,4.4574,4.6872,0.8738,1.5733,7.337,2.2534,5.7236,1.8974,1.8352,2.3155,5.3786,3.2988,0.2942,6.5969,1.1639,5.8922,0.4754,3.3807,2.8535,0.058,4.439,0.4528,4.5777,0.5991,3.8563,5.7288,3.2765,3.3489,2.6201,4.9687,0.5753,0.8259,7.203,1.0136,3.8947,4.6687,5.5096,2.048,3.2394,0.6664,5.2274,6.6709,4.6487,9.1349,1.2915,1.2204,7.9653,0.4741,0.5189,5.4971,4.1167,3.4378,6.4843,3.2879,2.7453,4.5564,0.8256,5.0782,7.2884,4.7713,3.6072,3.1325,5.6829,1.8407,4.5411,1.9365,3.8267,0.3062,4.1369,4.9217,2.234,2.1194,3.2722,1.3059,3.6135,1.6354,5.5481,6.0836,2.9639,3.3084,0.9996,2.2219,5.9112,8.3697,0.7355,5.0638,1.5474,1.3353,7.4549,0.2268,1.046,4.6297,4.116,1.6872,5.5982,1.3426,2.7713,0.3653,0.587,3.6034,0.0123,0.3173,1.7765,3.8374,1.1623,5.4058,1.1817,7.0653,5.9082,1.6155,4.182,1.9772,4.2014,2.051,4.3918,2.309,5.0951,4.1523,7.4792,2.2037,3.3871,0.5285,0.5563,2.0951,2.3673,4.122,2.1969,0.0808,2.888,3.9999,2.9131,4.5175,6.2504,0.2978,1.5144,4.6511,4.0258,1.5631,4.6187,4.6137,1.5034,5.0668,0.0749,3.2526,3.6678,2.3687,3.7786,2.5156,0.7341,1.8905,0.0119,6.7331,3.8892,0.5256,2.1412,0.9803,2.2643,5.4896,1.549,2.2223,3.4566,1.6427,3.3836,1.5202,6.1944,5.6452,0.5887,0.6246,3.2654,1.4434,1.4877,4.0771,6.2389,2.7524,0.6855,2.9261,0.3608,0.7249,1.8302,0.8894,0.8176,2.6753,3.5683,0.3841,2.4178,5.9471,0.2314,1.0388,1.4633,1.0812,0.4143,3.9955,4.2691,4.6909,2.1414,4.757,8.6018,0.9322,0.0003,1.4934,1.4695,0.0909,1.8336,7.1662,0.7483,1.1965,6.0876,3.7771,1.5696,4.7529,2.6866,2.6579,5.9792,4.0831,1.3133,5.3638,1.2225,5.5084,4.513,2.6218,0.5241,6.1271,1.2765,0.9923,0.306,2.8074,0.4948,3.2416,3.8966,4.468,3.6003,6.861,5.0122,0.5521,0.7101,5.6373,3.5478,6.1428,2.9306,0.0161,0.2257,5.2135,1.2093,3.0097,1.1578,1.6719,6.8437,6.9471,2.2603,1.2374,5.0222,4.5193,3.4923,3.9604,1.0492,4.9867,3.4674,3.8183,3.1676,2.2314,3.3744,6.9508,4.9407,5.1555,5.7585,0.2134,4.8025,4.5116,1.5395,1.2328,1.6331,3.1856,2.5683,5.5246,4.5075,0.8289,4.2792,5.5302,6.6587,1.3876,0.7622,0.7521,0.341,1.732,3.8494,1.9403,3.0138,0.6208,2.6835,4.2853,0.0099,5.9059,3.5261,0.3442,0.0151,6.6166,3.1462,2.2838,0.0798,10.9764,2.4071,4.729,5.388,1.5143,2.4643,2.3669,2.9073,3.2865,6.1878,3.6527,3.3684,0.9141,5.0381,2.0184,1.2545,2.4131,0.3691,1.5164,7.1565,3.3161,0.792,5.6573,2.574,3.3939,6.4798,1.1588,0.7664,7.0785,2.0665,2.3816,4.0025,5.936,3.8338,2.484,6.3905,0.8477,1.364,6.4822,1.0088,8.5712,1.3237,1.2113,7.2402,0.1247,0.8499,4.1152,2.0405,3.6897,0.8858,1.2309,3.8835,5.9347,7.4648,4.6709,4.278,2.848,5.4536,8.1661,3.9232,0.6762,3.7136,1.5347,3.0222,5.4543,0.3253,2.2276,3.072,5.0618,1.1103,4.0987,6.3796,1.3406,5.6157,4.714,4.5909,2.4521,0.9882,1.8056,0.6622,2.4483,4.6836,0.6408,0.04,2.9472,3.4644,2.5806,4.7874,0.2713,4.6495,1.084,1.125,4.6311,0.2827,3.5728,1.142,0.3284,2.5303,0.7895,1.8828,4.399,3.9172,3.0374,0.554,5.2293,1.6464,0.7911,1.0642,8.1718,1.2897,5.208,2.4327,0.4156,1.7276,5.9886,4.8689,0.3752,0.9682,6.553,11.1172,3.6939,1.0938,4.1895,2.1192,4.4924,1.5203,5.5243,0.1173,8.3558,0.9548,4.8196,0.4235,2.052,4.5629,3.3251,1.496,8.1789,5.4989,0.1357,0.5957,5.443,2.9653,1.6431,0.851,6.1263,0.1509,3.3387,4.84,0.5769,1.6213,2.0133,4.9812,1.0082,1.5398,4.0586,0.0127,0.3569,0.3061,0.4936,4.0524,0.1338,0.1222,2.1058,2.7105,1.8747,6.9388,1.5654,2.0915,2.9511,1.2969,3.6559,2.872,5.3628,0.6822,5.2333,2.7979,5.5437,0.0916,2.8482,4.5507,6.6006,0.1861,1.0021,3.7312,2.0234,5.5592,0.025,0.1792,0.4596,0.1423,2.2394,5.4458,2.3518,1.4768,0.4472,0.2275,0.899,1.5074,6.6314,2.1902,5.3072,2.5677,5.2327,4.8797,3.1525,6.4587,2.5575,2.8936,4.247,1.4963,2.3845,0.997,2.9521,2.5681,1.1223,2.2392,1.1498,5.8794,0.1008,0.4897,0.005,0.032,0.3841,0.7829,3.6172,0.4776,0.5946,0.0743,0.9928,4.7384,1.3344,4.887,2.3987,5.8881,3.1322,2.5243,1.6797,1.5921,0.5795,0.7255,6.3296,9.7216,1.7755,2.9197,0.0105,0.0635,0.4528,0.0858,0.7759,1.0852,1.3131,0.9246]}
{"prompt":"Around the world , various hell gates are open . Demons are pouring out of them , wounded . Satan himself appeared on television , `` Something has invaded hell . Humanity , we need your help ! ''","text":"Around the world, various hell gates are open. Demons are pouring out of them, wounded. Satan himself appeared on television, `` Something has invaded hell. Humanity, we need your help! ''\nIn the meantime, we have received the first invitations to a global war against the devil, for the salvation of the world, not for the sake of money or fame as many people expect. The world has been brought to the beginning of the end, but to our surprise, this is not the end of the world. Satan has a plan. He has been able to penetrate the holy places and is waiting to attack all of us : he plans to do a tremendous evil in a world that seems to have been abandoned to him.\nLet us pray... let us pray that our faith in a true God, even if it does not have power to save us, will help us to believe that the salvation of the world will come through love and obedience to Jesus Christ, who will help us to overcome our weaknesses in times like this.\nIn this time of quarantine many people are trying to find some joy within themselves, in the midst of their suffering, and they are doing many things to calm their mind and find peace within themselves. Some go hiking, some cook, some go to art galleries, some go on retreats... this is the case since April 22 when Pope Francis invited us to pray every day for the salvation of the world, and in particular for the sufferers.\nI know that these days that we are spending in confinement can be very hard : it is not easy for many of us to find something to do, or to talk to someone.\nHowever, when we hear the news that the Pope of the Vatican is asking us to pray daily for the world, it makes us think that this is important. The Pope of the Vatican is a real man of faith, and therefore he must trust that God can use us to save the world.\nWe can do so... but... how? Praying means letting ourselves be carried away and moved by the feelings that God wants to give us through this prayer. This is like breathing, for example. The body needs air to function. The mind also needs this to work properly and give us the courage and the strength to face the difficulties of life.\nIn the same way, we could ask God for strength, for courage, for faith, hope and love to live through these hard days.\nWhen we pray, it is like having the power of creation to control the air around us, and our thoughts and feelings, as well as our body.\nA recent study has shown the positive effect of prayer on the immune system. In fact, a group of volunteers who took a religious ritual for six weeks showed a clear rise in their defense mechanisms, which they attributed to the effect induced by the daily practice of prayer.\nThese are not just scientific words. The Lord works many miracles both to create and to save, and our faith is the power that allows us to access everything : the power to create, to save, to defeat our enemies, the power to heal wounds and heal the sick.","token_len":636,"entropy":[2.7641,3.1442,0.7229,7.7833,12.3602,9.7509,1.6083,3.4037,2.6677,7.3985,1.8644,6.4411,1.1547,0.7977,1.0158,1.2741,10.8523,3.3961,7.3585,3.5621,8.1185,3.0823,5.8372,1.667,13.7222,13.4965,4.1311,9.0168,7.4533,1.7119,10.8287,3.1102,3.5967,3.6338,3.3067,0.1257,2.8654,3.1234,2.3239,6.3664,1.483,4.2703,0.0646,4.164,1.9387,4.9045,2.8335,4.6807,9.4588,0.4051,2.5078,6.4282,5.3614,2.3714,1.4,2.7313,1.8442,4.7946,1.5725,6.9703,0.0237,1.5713,1.0413,2.4505,4.7567,2.194,1.0841,2.2651,0.0023,4.7514,1.907,3.3461,6.9575,3.1347,2.1559,4.888,0.5658,2.3176,2.9007,2.0681,1.6267,4.7494,0.8806,2.1063,8.0981,0.3092,1.5787,3.6643,1.128,2.5565,5.3448,3.7254,3.5625,0.4891,3.9434,2.037,1.097,0.9539,0.6838,1.4996,0.795,0.3913,0.4479,4.4849,1.5237,4.9185,0.9881,1.8698,1.0293,1.6492,3.8375,3.3135,0.0362,5.8387,0.9658,6.9669,2.7378,2.1767,6.3983,4.9404,2.023,4.7636,4.3344,1.4818,0.741,11.627,4.0255,4.9944,0.3402,4.456,3.6323,4.5584,3.6753,2.6402,4.1686,2.7718,1.5337,5.215,0.7029,1.7431,1.471,4.0903,1.6942,1.278,0.8584,2.0131,4.5362,0.4124,4.1975,6.6217,5.1672,0.0828,1.2121,2.1268,2.9328,4.3499,1.8265,5.5046,4.2867,0.5735,2.3816,5.2889,1.7395,1.4519,3.6155,0.1563,3.9289,4.7239,1.0173,2.2279,1.0461,0.2985,1.1015,4.1729,0.569,1.2491,4.6252,1.5868,2.077,6.1732,0.0927,0.6067,0.0882,2.3263,0.8981,2.6774,5.3574,1.0125,4.9682,0.8649,2.7379,0.0578,1.3953,2.4738,3.3823,4.4018,0.2705,0.964,4.4544,2.3924,4.5785,3.7507,5.3863,3.2867,1.8952,0.5024,0.848,3.4233,2.3742,4.4002,0.6127,13.4562,8.011,1.5548,1.0662,4.7578,0.1109,3.1808,3.9517,8.2383,5.7877,1.318,1.3746,3.7847,1.694,5.5738,0.0053,3.7443,2.7932,1.0892,1.9238,3.1457,1.0676,3.9787,5.6137,0.4827,1.8393,6.7031,1.255,3.4261,1.3768,5.5737,2.1357,2.1915,0.1937,0.2855,3.6592,6.5009,7.3493,0.886,1.1345,6.4134,0.9225,0.3704,2.845,0.7968,6.0832,2.7187,0.4717,0.3543,1.224,3.8994,6.759,1.0837,4.8764,4.8967,0.7484,1.8689,7.1777,8.3676,9.4109,4.427,5.6162,5.2853,1.1606,5.1088,2.635,0.3447,2.1509,6.4055,0.4276,1.9312,1.0349,1.6513,0.0284,0.4516,0.1007,2.0691,1.6986,3.4723,4.1729,1.1085,0.5651,7.9793,0.4671,2.8312,1.4247,3.5622,3.4626,0.8554,4.4187,4.6629,4.611,1.8238,1.1451,6.4228,3.7803,7.9279,5.1921,0.9296,1.8802,3.2343,8.5688,2.8095,0.6413,2.5072,1.5903,1.7781,3.2331,2.2617,0.2172,0.5373,2.538,4.724,1.2799,1.2908,1.5955,2.8504,0.8891,5.364,2.4814,4.3848,1.8503,3.6485,4.8902,0.2066,3.4242,0.8409,4.3448,1.7342,1.8227,1.5727,1.336,2.2964,5.1733,1.0402,3.022,1.697,4.8714,1.3123,0.2364,0.4941,3.9215,0.8253,0.2017,3.7067,1.1091,2.3969,2.7392,0.8295,2.8356,1.9347,2.3332,0.5565,5.9474,1.2495,2.9767,1.183,1.9241,0.1744,0.3576,1.4003,2.8745,4.1787,2.4763,2.2716,2.6259,1.1171,1.1688,5.9406,1.5644,3.7717,7.1417,1.506,4.0201,4.0519,5.0559,2.702,1.2275,3.1091,0.6316,0.0569,0.6312,1.1871,2.5958,3.1152,3.0764,3.2052,5.7211,3.0331,5.608,4.8461,2.4465,7.3677,1.1317,5.0467,5.5779,4.7157,1.161,5.7066,0.6793,3.0375,5.1732,2.0049,0.9775,5.9338,2.4659,4.5864,4.2431,1.3845,2.6163,0.3448,6.219,2.838,3.0123,0.4682,3.2617,0.7582,5.6264,5.2266,3.3112,3.7065,6.142,1.2345,2.8932,4.148,4.3594,4.9195,2.2103,3.6618,1.3482,2.2583,1.8388,5.834,0.0506,5.5047,3.3031,2.8885,4.0635,2.6373,5.8669,0.9897,1.6903,4.3836,2.9653,2.4229,1.4835,0.2191,4.0931,1.1687,4.6267,1.2617,0.3896,0.3875,0.9715,2.8601,1.6399,2.9693,0.0423,0.617,1.4908,5.0114,4.3583,1.6878,1.8169,5.7704,1.9206,1.6924,4.3166,0.4231,0.5972,3.7636,0.9572,8.1604,1.7363,2.6528,3.4487,4.533,3.0103,2.4415,5.7332,1.7797,0.7663,1.4834,3.9944,0.8805,2.0733,1.2694,2.9769,0.7523,3.1479,3.9251,2.7515,3.0598,1.8462,7.5952,1.6881,4.9318,1.1551,3.7741,2.2224,0.1659,1.6494,1.7817,4.2585,3.7294,1.5472,1.2231,3.3355,3.495,1.3154,0.016,0.7553,2.9166,2.1614,1.6076,4.5196,6.2872,1.4272,2.6058,0.5304,4.2749,5.3377,1.2376,0.4674,1.0594,0.3566,1.2812,3.7583,0.035,0.8607,2.5577,1.9648,0.0985,2.8653,3.8704,0.0682,4.5163,1.7628,3.8749,2.5486,4.8907,6.0266,3.8316,3.3552,1.0359,2.4871,1.7212,5.2432,5.4016,0.0425,2.2897,7.2537,4.2665,1.7599,2.0711,3.9626,3.5185,0.0323,1.3874,5.2387,9.1365,0.0359,1.7264,5.8992,2.9424,0.1943,0.4426,0.1898,0.9252,4.3117,3.3532,2.9072,2.6337,4.2055,6.0535,1.5628,2.0114,7.3365,7.1998,6.4382,1.5666,7.1561,3.0935,3.5824,1.3707,0.3005,3.6017,2.8686,0.8366,4.9584,3.8336,2.0498,2.7052,4.2724,1.5217,2.9451,0.883,0.0254,7.4908,6.7504,8.8502,1.8793,2.0924,0.6455,3.3375,1.2612,1.0204,0.9254,0.5606,0.4862,7.8883,4.804,0.5029,0.6711,3.0084,0.0483,0.1291,3.1219,3.0326,1.6574,3.6673,2.1432,0.7966,1.3159]}

That person or people, their name is a key in your life, you feel a connection or have been through similar experiences. Maybe you are going through changes.\nYou are going to see a person. You are going to love the person. You are seeing a real person. If you see a friend that your having had some bad times with you have probably lost touch with them. You are seeing someone you have not met in a long time. This person is new to you, and you have not made eye contact yet.\nIf you got scared then you might have seen someone close to you. You are close to someone and you are having a lucid dream of your lover or someone who you know. You might be seeing your dream lover in this dream, or someone you love for the first time and maybe you might be feeling a little nervous about it. Maybe you are having a dream where you kissed your dream lover and you are afraid.\nMaybe this is a dream about a person who is not real, you might have seen a person you know but you do not care about. The person might be a friend you have not spoken to in a long time.\nYou are going to make a new relationship. You are not sure how to act and you have to learn how to.

You are taking a new interest in yourself.\nYou are going through a difficult relationship with this person or people. Their name might be a key in your life and when you wake up you remember them very well.\nYou are going through a complicated family situation. Your parent has just given you a new grand baby. This is a good sign for you, but some people might see this as a bad sign.\nThis song is so beautiful. If you are currently seeing a person, or even if you have not seen this person for a long time. If you are currently having a relationship with you are going to see someone else and that person might be the love of your life.\nIf you are single right now, and you have been single for some time, and you have not yet met the guy or girl, and you have not found anyone who is perfect for you, then this could mean someone else has taken you away.\nYou might have found a new interest in yourself. You might be getting out of something or something in your life has changed and you have a new interest in yourself.\nIf you are having a dream like this you are going to be in a very vulnerable place in your life. So be careful. You are going to learn a lot about yourself if you are looking into a mirror, and you might not be happy about your new self.\nDreams can be the most intriguing and mysterious thing that has happened to us. I love it when dreams come true. Dreams always come to us at the worst time.","token_len":637,"entropy":[3.8828,6.4265,1.4712,9.313,0.1071,5.1042,4.8692,1.9064,1.612,3.4031,2.0642,5.0273,3.8772,8.1771,4.2397,0.0651,7.622,0.1989,3.8768,0.1918,1.5137,3.3988,3.9462,3.7419,1.829,6.0737,0.7612,5.4163,1.3254,3.0661,4.5247,1.9456,6.7162,5.3662,3.1879,0.5038,3.0103,0.0006,5.1091,5.6109,2.4508,3.4254,4.8227,3.877,4.4969,2.0787,4.356,4.8774,3.9643,1.4168,3.349,4.9578,3.9109,1.0437,1.8424,1.99,3.1511,5.6355,3.0803,3.0198,4.5545,5.0148,3.4974,4.1195,5.5059,0.9822,0.5737,3.5281,0.7591,1.5771,4.8869,0.7417,7.8727,2.2089,2.6162,7.3634,1.481,3.7774,2.2125,4.1239,1.8379,3.1374,3.8174,1.8703,1.3409,0.299,0.005,5.6759,3.6521,0.1299,0.8719,1.3666,0.582,6.4806,1.6522,4.4148,0.6128,0.7346,4.425,0.4787,3.3533,1.4172,4.7241,4.0313,5.673,8.2463,5.0384,4.2052,5.4303,5.3404,1.2202,3.4796,5.49,6.2473,3.8444,2.561,0.1337,0.6832,0.9706,1.8529,1.4578,2.8009,2.1171,2.315,2.7288,3.498,2.1159,2.5605,1.1434,0.9053,0.0501,0.4574,4.0504,0.7532,1.1807,5.285,1.0576,0.1248,2.0599,2.8787,1.1377,2.0954,1.9347,5.847,4.6042,0.0011,5.0334,0.2234,2.1604,2.9978,0.2492,8.2497,5.4073,5.2097,1.0338,2.2013,2.4657,3.3712,1.4468,4.1624,0.6408,0.0312,1.1663,1.6267,2.4908,4.6621,0.7124,0.8492,3.7612,1.3833,1.6419,4.0364,0.6842,1.316,0.025,4.9609,3.949,6.3211,1.9955,4.3372,3.4767,1.0727,2.3131,1.0359,1.6603,2.6018,2.0355,2.6218,3.8818,4.6294,5.5432,3.3292,5.24,1.7137,2.181,1.5744,2.2293,1.342,2.5056,5.8578,2.7408,0.6148,0.0098,3.3685,4.1739,1.1564,4.5298,1.593,2.9798,1.9215,2.6995,3.7947,2.3025,1.6243,0.3023,2.7332,0.3495,0.8568,2.7493,0.5734,1.5204,4.0856,0.586,7.869,2.018,2.3247,0.275,1.8497,2.0013,1.8259,5.8974,2.5722,1.4435,3.5411,4.2887,1.3537,2.2162,0.8207,3.4908,2.0444,1.7269,1.5197,1.8125,2.4352,4.5924,2.1668,2.8063,2.9919,1.8276,1.3986,1.9892,1.5304,2.5856,1.8308,1.7976,1.3655,2.7609,0.008,6.6734,1.1052,0.7975,4.1054,0.8834,2.183,0.6182,2.1357,2.5732,2.4032,1.5592,1.9585,5.8203,0.3036,1.9426,0.5904,0.2157,0.0127,0.8443,1.9671,1.4814,1.1756,1.7342,0.0309,5.0357,0.9642,3.2769,3.386,0.9053,1.0099,0.3975,3.7261,3.3141,2.5192,1.3283,5.0297,3.4183,1.1643,2.7867,2.5374,4.6793,1.2302,0.05,5.9085,1.222,1.0711,4.8474,1.0224,1.0787,3.0892,2.5891,0.7569,1.5431,3.1348,3.4413,0.3685,0.7325,5.1758,1.7613,3.1935,1.965,5.7634,2.5465,1.0799,0.7467,1.5484,0.852,5.8759,0.9393,2.5053,4.1757,0.2547,6.4092,0.9531,1.4734,0.8532,0.2258,1.3414,5.1168,0.9447,2.9764,4.8435,1.9025,2.1366,0.1224,3.1195,3.157,0.6884,6.9843,1.0078,2.1058,0.4149,1.0316,0.3193,1.3999,0.2249,0.1792,2.2297,7.0549,0.325,4.6089,0.0499,1.2377,5.321,2.4963,4.3091,0.4633,0.2216,1.6886,0.7862,0.3014,0.9899,1.2922,0.6557,5.9013,6.0032,0.9072,0.3523,2.0816,5.3062,2.4737,5.2479,4.5513,1.7749,0.843,1.7004,6.0202,5.0318,0.7835,3.7858,1.4813,1.5335,4.0903,3.8898,1.954,0.2728,3.1762,2.5374,5.418,1.0336,2.7893,3.8104,1.7757,0.5127,0.7706,1.952,0.3164,0.6971,1.3739,3.1612,10.3878,1.03,5.3769,3.0792,1.1521,3.8909,0.2703,2.0182,7.4553,4.1018,1.6526,1.4173,2.684,3.2262,3.4425,2.5777,0.176,1.3109,2.8776,0.8172,2.6168,0.4125,1.9892,0.6791,0.5234,0.0324,2.4986,2.7463,0.2772,1.2109,5.3206,2.2757,0.4454,5.4493,0.5515,6.3784,5.9613,2.2176,0.2101,2.4006,3.0319,2.8858,3.3237,3.5992,0.3857,1.7085,0.6788,3.3092,5.1924,0.7479,0.0654,0.0225,0.3383,1.0644,2.0912,0.2138,0.9176,8.5097,6.4987,0.0177,1.2293,2.7473,0.5813,1.6106,2.3207,5.0241,0.3079,3.2031,0.0655,1.2928,1.9132,0.5808,1.3667,2.2084,4.4248,2.9074,3.2473,6.1033,1.8596,1.7381,3.1388,2.5104,0.6828,1.3771,1.3239,4.5135,4.5018,2.4199,1.4007,5.6905,1.6751,0.0682,0.7162,1.7791,1.7673,3.647,3.9232,5.2833,2.4781,1.8259,3.5299,2.0375,2.5929,1.3675,1.3606,1.5799,2.9064,1.7081,4.1397,1.5318,1.8604,6.7239,0.2855,0.8691,0.8366,1.3938,1.9295,1.1155,4.5216,4.228,0.1712,6.7806,2.7888,3.9337,3.7367,1.5735,0.0371,6.7889,0.9737,2.6801,0.5579,1.7345,2.9351,0.3909,2.7317,0.2986,1.1221,0.2261,0.9367,1.5142,0.2012,0.7186,1.9691,0.3649,1.7401,4.3911,0.2014,2.7682,2.0682,0.995,0.084,2.117,2.7104,0.5405,2.5457,6.3834,1.4752,3.9738,0.4323,0.1845,0.2724,5.8357,4.1785,1.844,1.1521,2.027,1.6417,0.8202,0.0327,5.9321,2.8034,0.5028,0.9365,0.1791,5.1126,0.101,0.7969,5.4871,4.4211,1.6542,6.3216,2.3675,2.6321,1.328,1.818,1.8432,1.2164,3.9506,1.6176,3.1014,2.9995,4.4515,0.44,0.7722,7.5299,0.9627,1.9547,0.7424,5.2528,1.7315,7.9964,1.7863,5.2914,2.9038,1.9416,3.0493,0.6417,0.3376,4.5593,1.0295,3.6658,3.8976,3.0817,1.2675,3.7052,1.5287,0.4365,0.7519,4.3051,5.1041,2.1314,4.7427,2.8454,4.3804,1.1709,5.6931,2.1922,0.967]}
{"prompt":"Dating a man while still in the closet is hard , especially when you two are in a trench , with wives waiting at home for when the war is over .","text":"Dating a man while still in the closet is hard, especially when you two are in a trench, with wives waiting at home for when the war is over. The only way to navigate this tricky road of social expectations is to take steps to help your boyfriend come out, like being open and honest and letting him know you understand what he\u2019s saying, or showing him that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal (and that it\u2019s not like he\u2019s outing himself to everyone!). Here are five good ways to help your boyfriend come out. #1 Keep it civil. It\u2019s okay for you to tell him why you feel the way you do about this, and for him to tell you why he\u2019s not ready for the big reveal. If he\u2019s not comfortable talking about it, don\u2019t force it, but allow it to come up and let him tell you why. #2 Show him support. Like we said, your friend deserves a chance, and, more importantly, he needs it. It\u2019s up to you to be there if he decides to come out to you. If you tell him that you\u2019re not worried and supportive, it gives him a huge amount of comfort. #3 Keep it fun. Even if you feel a little awkward around him now, you don\u2019t have to shut him out of everything. Be a cheerleader and make sure that you remind him of how much you appreciate his dedication and sacrifice for all of the years you\u2019ve been together. #4 Support him with his decision. At the same time, you should also take a step back from your position as the one giving him advice and let him determine his next move. #5 Keep it out of the media. We know that you may feel the need to share that the entire world knows that you\u2019re in a relationship. However, we also know that you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured into choosing between your relationship or your freedom. That\u2019s the thing with social media \u2013 they never forget. It is crucial that you respect his decision. He\u2019s making a significant decision, and you should hold him to standards that\u2019s high. If you aren\u2019t able to trust his words, it\u2019ll be difficult to navigate this tricky road. The best option for both of you is to have a private discussion with your friend, and to let him know about your own thoughts on this topic. If you\u2019re honest, you\u2019ll help him come out, and you\u2019ll still allow him to be completely in control of what\u2019s going on. However, if you go into this topic without him at least in mind, it could be one of the top reasons that your friendship breaks down in the future.\nThe Best Sex Position For Men And Women | The Best Position For Sex By Jessica Johnson June 2, 2018 April 1, 2020\nThe Best Ways For Sex Without Pills | 4 Great Ways For The Unmature Man June 14, 2020 June 8, 2020","token_len":637,"entropy":[8.6599,3.4131,3.6932,5.6785,4.8846,2.4829,2.2296,3.2728,1.4492,5.7606,2.221,2.5635,0.9347,0.9157,10.436,0.6934,2.6569,1.768,9.198,3.4506,4.0747,10.9784,5.3718,3.2287,2.2206,2.4003,7.6534,2.2543,4.8139,1.2489,0.2279,0.4556,3.3957,3.1401,1.4447,0.5287,8.0987,1.4382,5.3877,5.5181,2.9409,5.2931,6.1977,0.4754,0.3903,4.3372,5.1285,0.712,3.4656,2.2068,4.7628,6.4773,2.1512,3.7308,4.9727,4.4576,3.2693,1.8807,0.6375,3.0924,3.9914,0.6856,0.3721,1.8301,5.0091,2.2209,1.0667,16.5187,7.8726,0.248,4.4374,2.1977,2.4819,5.3925,1.0468,2.7051,0.6789,3.0084,1.7731,0.3923,0.1519,3.0396,3.1059,2.1273,0.0084,0.2755,3.1042,2.5313,0.0401,4.9656,2.4184,1.8897,2.3733,2.0776,0.0068,0.0272,2.4682,4.548,1.4894,1.6302,0.004,0.0198,12.951,2.222,1.3518,4.5952,5.2071,5.7486,0.4587,3.4587,5.6863,1.1788,0.2214,1.6911,1.0982,0.3416,1.5004,0.0494,2.0025,7.0102,0.1669,5.817,2.4694,4.8179,2.0036,3.1114,2.2703,0.1112,0.0028,2.7969,2.8495,1.5378,0.2922,2.571,0.9862,5.625,0.6572,3.062,2.556,0.1611,0.8062,0.1597,4.3098,4.4113,1.7672,2.1526,4.7776,0.6079,0.1425,2.8385,0.0901,2.0878,0.8311,0.4042,0.0172,0.0096,2.5991,5.169,1.3236,2.3352,4.2269,2.6508,0.8147,2.801,0.8608,0.685,0.0073,0.0136,2.4282,4.2792,2.3847,0.3968,0.9507,0.6133,3.0909,0.1048,0.0493,0.0054,5.235,1.3176,2.2897,1.909,6.5635,2.4945,1.3114,3.1788,2.7662,2.894,3.5061,0.3552,3.8731,0.2186,2.1732,1.3398,1.7868,0.0031,4.425,0.5042,6.9382,0.1788,5.7472,4.7328,1.2302,0.5659,3.6377,4.3806,5.7436,2.2428,4.0657,3.4653,0.852,6.2072,4.1406,0.2138,0.0638,2.1408,3.1048,2.632,0.3299,3.3476,1.044,0.0162,0.0044,3.4958,0.0078,0.174,0.4369,3.5257,2.716,5.2247,0.5206,5.5863,0.5037,1.5318,0.0957,2.9601,0.5659,1.033,2.0637,1.3242,4.1246,0.0969,1.6959,0.9711,3.6321,0.0782,1.7352,2.0272,6.5628,4.2789,8.6703,0.7927,3.4264,5.5826,0.1624,1.1424,5.635,4.072,0.0209,4.0625,1.4641,2.7189,0.0013,2.8523,0.7497,4.8793,0.2473,4.5362,0.5027,0.897,3.9203,3.5151,0.3293,3.5582,4.0854,0.6271,6.0567,0.238,1.7076,3.4501,0.3123,0.1129,0.0098,0.4799,0.0264,5.7199,1.0574,2.3124,1.5587,3.6051,0.8462,5.072,3.1005,6.8791,0.0039,1.8123,2.7817,1.0636,2.3238,1.6631,5.4334,0.0424,1.4129,2.3539,1.5205,1.1996,2.933,1.7011,6.5918,1.3342,5.8033,3.4321,4.0009,0.5918,2.8795,8.1287,1.505,1.3842,0.0302,1.2221,1.345,1.2241,0.3208,2.4144,0.002,4.9412,0.7542,2.4291,2.5896,5.781,0.7996,5.5965,1.4082,2.1258,0.0029,0.1338,1.7891,2.2127,2.4214,4.3901,2.693,2.4032,0.0891,2.3238,1.989,6.17,1.4295,2.2955,3.3349,5.1861,0.7329,3.4091,1.4704,6.7356,0.1088,5.4569,2.6911,4.1388,0.79,0.1977,3.6703,0.0051,2.2491,0.4757,5.4593,0.1639,1.2972,4.8421,0.3117,4.5157,3.3691,0.8806,2.0977,4.4481,2.2733,3.5573,1.4549,0.0693,2.5986,4.7156,5.21,5.7784,0.8654,2.1162,3.4596,0.5864,3.0076,0.0296,1.3076,3.8179,2.092,1.3818,2.3683,3.4714,0.0298,3.0717,1.7765,0.2117,0.0649,1.1297,5.7397,0.0718,0.0248,0.0037,3.1929,2.3766,1.8256,6.2343,1.8579,2.117,3.3184,2.4844,1.2618,7.3593,0.9352,3.5618,3.2454,0.0168,0.5191,3.53,4.4246,3.9083,4.7265,0.165,4.7958,4.8314,5.5755,5.5886,1.399,2.4712,2.9829,6.5232,1.1031,0.3004,5.9028,4.0829,0.5368,1.5316,4.131,1.8595,0.0192,0.0749,4.263,1.2204,7.0521,0.3483,1.3742,0.5538,1.5421,1.8497,5.6946,0.5532,2.2727,10.4814,0.7513,7.4531,0.0213,3.3497,2.9568,0.6866,2.5169,0.8287,4.9966,0.5187,0.0425,0.0024,2.4117,0.0078,5.2898,2.8022,4.6345,0.6936,3.0685,1.2059,0.0062,2.8058,1.1133,4.2311,0.8316,5.9336,1.9536,3.283,0.421,1.2864,4.4053,1.7298,4.0732,1.9671,4.9798,0.2714,0.1957,0.2872,0.1123,4.4943,1.0847,3.6674,3.0248,1.2955,1.4173,1.7822,1.9109,1.3419,3.2187,2.3481,0.2889,0.5125,4.1604,1.3335,4.5033,3.6007,1.4754,1.3277,2.5599,0.2829,2.6241,0.7731,4.9928,0.0128,1.071,5.8916,1.5616,1.4699,3.1144,0.0144,0.2254,5.1827,0.3204,3.2217,0.3443,2.5068,0.9692,1.807,0.9528,0.0047,0.0345,6.2764,4.5923,0.1105,0.1441,3.2231,6.3127,4.8038,0.8478,0.4437,1.9676,4.0634,0.0236,0.0721,0.5584,0.7503,0.949,4.6508,0.0089,0.9219,0.53,6.5448,3.6051,2.214,4.7977,3.6617,3.5138,5.1579,4.1937,4.6998,2.293,0.1378,2.242,2.8332,1.9086,6.1561,0.2602,0.2615,8.2269,1.8206,2.073,2.3923,3.8071,3.9826,0.2416,4.1416,0.4748,4.8597,0.1931,3.1246,6.9917,3.3121,5.7963,6.67,2.6205,3.0629,3.3509,0.4041,7.2263,3.4989,1.8249,5.3592,0.1635,4.5113,4.6268,5.0494,5.4954,5.6006,3.6449,0.0976,2.7573,8.2684,2.9087,0.0886,8.3854,2.6846,2.8724,1.8123,7.6677,2.7429,4.5385,5.5943,5.7865,5.1675,3.3597,6.8351,5.7583,0.8205,0.5397,6.2028,7.0564,6.7752,4.4903,4.9016,7.4901,5.3606,0.0015,6.4559,2.639,3.0889,0.0036,0.2927]}
{"prompt":"You 've created the first functional AI , and as it 's first task you told it to select it 's own name . The answer was a lot more unnerving than you thought it 'd be .","text":"You've created the first functional AI, and as it's first task you told it to select it's own name. The answer was a lot more unnerving than you thought it 'd be. As you can see in the picture, the AI starts with an incredibly simple program, only keeping track of a lot of its own features, and only looking for a way to survive. If there's water nearby, the AI 'll move to a place where it can drink. If a snake appears, the AI will get scared, and in the shortest possible time it might give up all hopes of surviving, and crawl away. If any of those features do not have a solution, it will look for the next interesting thing. The idea of programming is to build an algorithm that is the'secret sauce' of your AI, the little things you 'll program it to do that will help your AI survive in the world it's facing. I 'll get to the point where you 'll code your own AI, and show you just how complex this topic really is.\nHere is the first part 2 of a 2 part series. Part 1 can be found HERE, and in this video we make the first steps in AI programming. I always get asked how or what exactly should a person who wants to learn more about AI programming do, and I always say \" start with this video \" and many of the viewers of this video find themselves hooked onto the topic. Part 2 on this video I 'll explain how to build your own AI, and in the next video the next steps of creating an AI, including the implementation of the concept.\nIn the new video below, I 'll explain more in depth what I mean by the three key components of AI programming, and show you just how the concept is implemented and realized into practice. We show you what we learn from our first example, the Simple AI, and how the different features of the program work together as an integrated whole, making the AI not only smart, but also complex in nature. We also go through the different phases during AI development, and in this video we focus on the building of the basic skills in developing different types of AI. I show you how we started with the Simple AI and the main features it has, and how we added more and more features to the program, and the key features that were added. Later on, I show and explain what is called the Back-Propagation Algorithm, and how it was implemented in the first version of the AI.\nToday I 'll get very detailed about the different levels of AI that exists, from a very technical and simple level, to a very complex one, and there will be no middle ground. I 'll show you how complex AI can get, with some truly impressive examples. We also dive into what makes AI smarter or more intelligent, and you 'll see that the idea of intelligence is quite simple, only using a little bit of intuition, and that you need to follow certain rules. I have decided after watching this video that I've become an AI person, I've learned so much from it.","token_len":637,"entropy":[5.5189,6.0521,3.0535,3.5741,6.8716,8.0238,2.5304,1.7812,5.6662,3.3163,2.2578,5.793,7.5062,1.2727,9.6634,1.325,0.6461,6.5388,4.9657,2.6972,2.2453,4.9359,1.1547,2.9532,5.7985,1.7885,3.2828,3.4702,2.6429,11.209,0.0601,0.7242,1.7105,2.1128,2.3104,11.524,5.2197,8.6978,1.6407,4.5741,1.2812,2.3189,0.2035,2.0828,0.2619,2.5238,1.3837,1.508,2.0183,5.351,3.1781,3.1581,5.6867,1.99,5.5607,1.7578,5.0545,7.3333,0.6472,0.022,3.278,5.4868,0.1434,3.4054,2.2681,4.9647,1.9167,1.6381,3.9416,4.5139,1.4568,3.3449,6.1621,0.1716,7.4038,1.013,4.0902,3.7722,0.8439,8.4989,4.9185,0.5056,2.5427,0.3886,6.8667,6.7802,4.8173,1.6051,2.8941,2.1915,1.3236,0.5339,1.2713,4.4985,2.695,1.6122,3.6021,5.8112,4.914,0.9875,1.0389,0.1443,1.3857,5.6268,4.2527,1.9634,0.6533,5.741,1.8007,7.8536,3.244,0.1595,1.5074,4.5376,5.8711,0.8639,5.1191,5.8783,0.663,2.4672,2.6686,2.0027,7.0077,2.2911,0.657,2.2969,5.6852,1.2072,2.4949,4.0999,4.4522,1.1695,4.7821,1.1117,3.8138,0.4925,1.4425,0.8707,6.0845,0.6276,3.1633,2.9243,8.2342,2.2971,1.9385,2.6269,4.8502,2.3384,6.216,2.7624,1.6536,4.0723,2.7975,2.9787,0.6487,2.8725,5.2083,10.6257,10.2976,4.9164,11.7165,7.2842,3.1097,3.657,2.898,1.4042,4.7992,6.2895,1.8237,2.175,5.1781,0.8029,6.4728,3.3154,0.6002,1.3606,3.993,1.6164,3.0325,3.4167,0.9475,0.8718,3.3482,0.9336,2.9396,3.1733,1.9147,6.4036,0.2893,3.8832,4.8072,0.2122,4.5369,1.6163,2.9028,1.7182,0.4839,2.5666,2.4017,0.0223,6.1043,2.6836,1.4253,1.3752,1.8703,1.0939,6.6122,1.7902,4.6168,0.1075,5.0475,2.85,7.9215,1.5798,0.0746,0.3767,1.4678,7.7358,2.0375,1.3337,3.6238,2.7111,9.2939,0.7856,3.0886,3.2809,0.5793,0.7595,1.7821,4.0613,0.3276,4.8656,0.0594,0.3575,3.7368,3.1058,2.0218,5.6962,2.6059,3.989,2.8842,6.1462,2.0549,1.6741,3.615,2.4901,6.3563,2.1801,0.6898,3.1502,7.1959,4.2174,2.5264,2.4799,7.1148,3.6193,5.2008,6.7753,4.2356,3.8834,6.6588,3.1544,0.1055,1.8771,4.8691,0.4081,0.9204,1.0371,1.6897,1.3068,0.9262,1.2558,1.6218,2.0824,2.9698,12.276,0.8352,3.3066,4.5937,2.2574,1.9251,7.5924,1.6847,0.9619,8.3471,4.741,0.5901,1.3315,6.6763,3.698,5.2959,6.2299,1.4376,1.7582,0.8412,3.9139,0.0441,6.2441,2.8526,3.1181,5.0137,3.2942,0.1583,2.412,1.2381,0.6907,2.8135,2.7802,0.0969,0.6094,1.5372,0.6503,2.0903,2.0295,1.0309,2.2253,4.7999,3.1162,4.3122,3.6453,5.2659,2.5395,0.5115,3.9128,5.9661,1.9352,5.8605,0.4039,1.5389,5.0828,2.8007,1.3121,3.6571,1.525,6.2908,1.1807,3.2859,1.3932,1.3293,2.9992,0.0311,1.8614,5.0111,4.5341,1.3594,2.6365,2.0069,2.8257,0.4064,2.4899,6.94,4.0314,3.087,0.4161,0.8086,0.2809,1.5104,1.0431,4.8635,0.309,2.5986,0.0782,3.6317,3.5038,2.4472,3.5031,3.0039,8.0863,5.8245,6.3211,0.2158,4.5014,5.2738,0.4279,3.6686,2.708,6.2194,1.8511,3.3396,2.31,4.7822,1.0981,3.2949,7.5027,1.3567,1.6009,0.7914,1.2025,2.8051,5.5518,4.2786,1.1636,1.1224,3.0429,3.5665,0.2145,4.5709,2.7901,2.9131,3.1654,2.2644,4.3984,1.9178,2.9446,5.9419,0.8722,4.1032,0.6291,0.0469,1.5743,4.5061,4.1255,4.8441,0.2917,2.959,1.5171,4.9951,1.9076,1.1692,4.738,4.8717,6.9564,3.2768,1.3028,0.503,1.2177,4.0902,1.5017,0.8422,0.9313,5.4716,0.1444,1.1099,6.3935,0.8264,1.1422,3.7208,6.8586,4.2486,5.3168,6.815,1.5127,0.0043,0.5187,1.0509,2.997,4.6258,0.125,0.9452,2.8321,6.2124,2.0607,1.3774,2.7998,0.0906,2.5106,2.4604,6.2491,2.6248,3.6591,1.9045,0.7979,0.5796,1.0233,1.2661,4.8981,2.4931,2.9462,0.0206,1.2519,1.1544,2.04,0.9903,1.582,1.308,3.5512,5.9208,2.3737,1.6155,4.2969,1.3934,3.1054,6.4153,1.1708,1.2118,1.5342,1.736,8.4738,1.0322,3.446,3.4653,3.0175,1.5075,7.5002,3.001,6.6099,0.5069,0.0267,6.1535,0.0496,0.6315,1.008,0.8361,0.9622,3.0351,2.5863,1.7421,0.9802,1.985,3.0,0.1145,0.6087,1.777,0.8197,1.1073,5.7729,1.8181,2.6891,0.0237,4.5529,6.63,5.0925,0.9535,1.0562,4.2268,5.1646,0.1891,1.962,3.4102,8.3821,1.7686,3.9986,3.8549,3.7,5.0024,3.6803,3.6305,1.9598,1.3079,0.638,1.2638,1.1357,0.4924,2.7587,1.0047,1.1748,5.9431,2.9339,0.1971,3.6384,7.377,0.2333,1.2933,1.8123,1.5656,0.0039,1.4707,0.165,0.9685,7.4172,3.0694,1.9977,3.3759,0.8498,5.0536,3.2356,7.745,3.715,1.2788,1.4622,3.3383,2.3222,5.8111,0.3451,3.6373,2.7419,2.7067,7.3859,5.2735,1.2651,1.9659,0.9292,0.4849,5.7843,2.7085,0.0025,1.2423,3.2398,1.9348,4.5631,0.4891,7.1504,1.135,4.7875,1.9412,0.9723,6.6997,3.4835,1.7413,3.9677,0.6956,0.1334,4.5596,1.768,0.8748,2.151,2.9797,4.1774,0.4623,4.8758,4.4684,1.0535,2.0512,2.1325,4.3989,5.5511,7.5855,3.8426,1.2324,0.552,0.9385,1.2857,5.2914,4.3884,3.3863,2.503,4.512,0.7089,4.5251,3.2235,2.3799,3.0836,0.0877,1.5677,1.3965,1.1542]}

It turns out North Korea is super advanced and live in a massive underground paradise. Their only job? To live on the surface for 1 month each year. Recently, they are on strike and want to stay underground away from the crazy people and wars above. Why is that, I don't know but you will have to find out.\nMy mom bought this for me and there is no way I can pass this up. Great deal at Amazon. (It's not the best coffee in the world, but it's a great deal, too!!)\nIn honor of Earth Day, I created a quick design and put the finished cards on Etsy. If you like what you see, I encourage you to check out my Etsy store, Dainty Dots Design.\nThere are a variety of card types available in this bundle. Choose from a few pre-made ones or create your own. These cards can be sent directly to your child's teacher or the teacher will be able to purchase them from my store.\nI have created cards in 5 different card sizes. I have created 6 different designs and 5 of them are ready to use in the card bundle. They are 5 x 7, 4.25 x 6.25, 4.75 x 6, 4.25 x 5.5, and 4 x 5. This card will fit perfectly into an envelope.\nI have tried to make this kit in such a way that a child only needs 2 stamps and 1 ink pad to create these amazing cards. The stamps and inks are not included. All of the designs (except 4) can be customized. If you'd like the color of your child's name stamped on the front instead of a stamped background, please contact my shop first to get the pricing on it. I can also create a card for your child if you have a favorite theme that you would like me to incorporate into their cards. They are sure to be the star of any special event or teacher appreciation party.\nThe kit comes with a printable card template for a 5 x 7 card, so the teacher should not need to purchase one. The card size I chose was 4 x 5, because that is what my daughter likes the best. She would much rather this size than the bigger cards with the large flower on the front. She loves playing with the inks that come in the kit.\nIf you would like a custom card, please contact me to discuss the design and pricing. I can create cards that are specific to the needs of your child. I strive to provide something that your child will love to use.

{"prompt":"When a child is abducted by aliens , the child 's guardian angel joins forces with the monster under the bed to save them .","text":"When a child is abducted by aliens, the child's guardian angel joins forces with the monster under the bed to save them. If a child is abducted by aliens, the child will be shown an image of the Guardian angel with a monster under the bed. In the third episode, the Guardian angel appeared for the first time\nIn the third episode, the Guardian angel was shown to appear in the third episode. In the third episode, when Daisuke wakes from sleep, he looks around and sees a Guardian angel, who is standing next to a white bed. In the next scene, the angel points to the white bed, saying, \"You see it? That is the monster who has taken a small child from you. \" Then it jumps into the white bed, attacking Daisuke. This scene was also shown in the anime and manga.\nIn the manga, it is shown in the chapter 3. In this chapter, in the case of the third disappearance of Taka, Daisuke is on the point of discovering the truth, and it is revealed that the angel is on an enemy list, and can be summoned only by him to protect Taka. In the manga, the angel looks slightly different in appearance than the anime version.\nThe guardian angel and his white bed came from an unknown location. In the manga, after being kidnapped by aliens, Taka is placed at the bottom of a basement. Daisuke and the team arrive at the basement, but then realize that the basement is being kept at an incredibly high level and in the darkness with a red light source on the ceiling. The room is kept at a high temperature, and has a white bed with a white pillow. They look around and discover that the room has a white ceiling. They later learn, that the house is owned by a family doctor named Takano. He had recently treated a baby, who had an unusual fever. The baby then disappeared after the fever started. The next day, after investigating, they arrive at the house where Taka is. Later that day, they find a white bed in the basement with a white pillow inside. Daisuke asks why the bed is on the basement, but Taka then says that the bed will be sent back to the hospital after healing. The next day, Daisuke again goes in the basement and sees the white bed. He sees Taka lay a blanket on the ground.\nLater, Taka shows Daisuke a secret box with mysterious symbols on it. Taka opens the box and then throws it on top of the bed. The symbols on the box and the symbol on the white bed are the same. Takano then reveals that the child from the other day is Taka. Taka then disappears with the white bed. When the Guardian angel appeared in the first season, none of the characters knew that the red light bulb on the ceiling of the basement in this case was there to summon the Guardian angel.

The reason behind the popularity of Google is the large number of links that it has to offer to the visitors looking for some information.","token_len":641,"entropy":[5.307,1.5318,9.2725,1.367,2.8386,3.5865,2.1285,4.5828,2.0659,6.4794,7.6095,0.0046,5.0493,0.8565,4.6375,0.7419,10.9636,3.1428,1.0717,1.2147,11.3918,0.4992,4.0519,0.233,1.0166,8.9768,0.1428,7.6161,2.9484,1.8024,4.504,4.2943,2.6403,1.6229,3.1968,4.4205,12.8093,7.3512,2.4935,2.7163,0.2689,1.3924,0.8591,6.511,0.3894,0.5173,1.264,0.3233,2.2461,7.4344,6.7226,2.9678,4.0012,1.0551,0.0193,6.0253,0.4681,2.3875,1.632,11.8312,4.128,13.0685,2.3045,5.3101,0.6875,6.2734,7.6466,2.0191,4.7472,4.1379,0.7087,1.6414,0.2065,2.5403,7.0333,1.1742,3.1251,4.7233,6.5628,11.2354,6.8808,5.4692,4.9511,2.2616,3.4591,2.2037,3.899,4.6023,6.7117,0.1471,1.1096,12.8762,0.2304,0.664,2.7385,3.2027,0.0216,1.8596,2.2521,1.4133,4.5392,2.699,6.1936,0.9322,0.5972,0.3666,4.1119,2.0624,0.4554,0.2237,6.0306,7.0479,5.0445,3.2125,1.5416,0.6312,0.0108,3.9018,1.809,2.9553,10.0861,5.9257,6.9252,0.9566,0.355,5.8617,2.6262,0.1843,1.1239,5.746,5.3125,6.5364,3.353,0.923,1.3281,1.8694,1.2816,5.5207,2.6152,4.0941,1.9229,0.0703,8.0463,4.2175,3.9325,0.0952,2.4016,1.42,1.9288,4.3784,4.267,5.5469,2.6721,1.3391,6.5475,0.4225,5.3523,7.1508,1.2036,4.1095,2.603,2.956,2.7114,4.4256,0.9911,3.6037,6.6007,3.4528,1.6377,3.3036,3.0725,5.0638,3.4614,5.5761,5.608,0.3599,0.052,0.1967,0.357,1.0152,8.6455,5.4131,6.3573,0.7768,2.5754,3.0078,3.7683,5.7347,2.9213,1.8937,3.9887,4.9642,3.1786,0.2799,2.9153,3.9521,2.8146,2.7488,2.1206,0.2465,1.484,0.0258,5.8262,7.9892,4.8734,2.941,8.3295,5.4497,0.7146,1.1226,5.6033,4.1517,3.2427,4.5385,7.3322,0.7944,0.9846,4.5509,0.6562,2.9039,0.4594,3.5772,1.2652,3.9548,3.4233,2.0969,1.8183,6.6638,1.1053,5.927,0.6861,0.8491,0.3845,1.6968,6.5601,7.1082,0.1012,1.6697,1.4069,8.7521,7.9066,3.7602,0.3589,3.2907,6.4763,1.099,1.8299,5.3187,2.0155,0.3162,0.1895,4.0685,5.057,2.9796,5.3679,0.7071,2.6247,3.0143,1.4979,3.1567,2.8408,2.0162,1.0913,0.1669,3.7099,3.3,0.9433,0.7102,6.0101,0.4965,4.0362,3.5758,1.9628,3.4538,2.9692,0.425,3.8903,2.8407,3.5681,2.526,1.7875,2.74,5.0051,0.7631,7.781,2.5202,5.9718,0.2423,2.6984,3.16,1.0975,1.9647,3.8591,2.7422,0.4845,2.6158,1.7327,4.7494,1.9825,7.7845,0.1401,2.0334,5.0071,0.388,4.0484,4.9336,5.3739,4.3716,5.9432,6.2122,1.7198,3.3653,5.0272,3.876,0.1286,1.2895,0.8761,1.5302,1.2188,4.4545,4.6623,0.6382,7.0876,1.2595,2.3347,3.4336,0.1584,1.2378,6.3721,3.8773,0.091,2.2748,0.7955,3.9285,1.3942,2.1068,0.1836,4.53,1.0893,2.1181,5.3573,5.0185,1.904,3.8605,1.6461,2.5435,7.4588,1.0629,3.8438,8.5119,2.988,0.006,0.5941,0.3394,3.2545,5.225,0.6145,2.147,10.2338,0.9468,3.759,1.8084,7.987,2.2209,4.7366,0.782,0.5908,1.2218,0.4073,3.3784,0.1655,2.2586,4.0846,1.529,1.5492,2.37,0.4699,0.8854,2.5629,5.1562,3.9016,0.7342,2.3153,3.1236,1.9041,3.6438,3.5889,1.2915,4.4586,0.1671,0.2575,5.3891,0.0035,2.5787,7.0391,3.0616,0.3802,2.6078,3.6778,0.4223,3.0036,2.1188,5.4331,0.2947,2.9736,5.3932,3.7527,0.9032,3.0871,4.7762,2.7135,1.2416,4.0349,1.5507,0.9494,0.2198,2.9838,0.1218,4.0458,2.2745,2.2151,2.7053,4.6921,0.0078,0.3407,0.5635,3.9884,3.9857,5.1149,3.9852,3.9938,2.9828,2.247,1.3438,5.0658,3.5701,1.554,3.4652,0.8008,3.288,4.9139,2.7889,1.8845,3.683,3.5257,2.6072,6.5984,1.5862,5.2888,0.5661,1.3767,0.1437,0.4998,0.5708,2.4833,1.816,0.5035,2.3908,5.8338,3.9059,5.133,4.7498,4.1805,6.1956,1.9619,3.8643,6.2918,1.3186,6.4201,6.9246,2.445,2.849,1.6207,6.926,4.8138,0.5647,8.6248,4.011,0.8267,1.1256,1.802,14.8425,8.0317,6.478,3.3424,1.996,8.0762,2.1869,5.5272,1.2769,7.792,3.133,0.7469,4.9575,2.386,5.4851,1.9945,8.5924,0.2086,2.052,3.2485,1.1765,5.7595,3.3689,6.2985,4.0732,3.3444,4.6186,1.7022,0.3222,3.0577,4.3375,3.6284,0.9596,0.4315,3.3072,3.8223,3.0491,4.3258,4.7534,5.5196,1.7557,9.4381,1.411,1.2687,3.2312,1.1076,0.0744,1.511,4.4916,1.6058,2.3115,2.3197,6.7832,5.8793,0.0836,1.8972,0.7095,5.4917,4.3918,0.9856,2.6549,1.6935,7.9354,5.931,2.2493,2.2942,1.3022,1.917,1.4945,4.0544,0.2482,1.7527,0.7936,1.4757,6.319,0.4938,0.3222,3.3325,2.0454,2.8401,0.0229,0.0876,2.9149,0.3046,1.4983,3.6321,1.5451,3.4461,1.6103,3.0198,7.3489,3.2743,0.884,0.3864,3.1217,3.6257,0.3969,1.0541,0.3712,4.8056,3.2343,1.1096,2.2016,0.9199,1.9087,2.1113,5.5716,3.3875,1.4725,0.2757,0.3219,1.0666,1.8605,2.1996,3.8817,2.0033,1.2819,1.435,5.2758,6.3499,3.0546,1.8482,1.0383,0.2961,1.7318,5.2985,1.3762,0.0019,2.8197,3.5505,4.4036,2.2049,0.3016,2.1187,5.8958,4.266,2.0102,2.0913,0.1819,0.948,0.6842,2.3202,5.4011,0.5884,0.0109,6.5528,1.8135,3.7936,1.7081,0.8795,3.5109,2.9887,2.1956,4.6191,6.5169,0.4993,5.2908,1.9461,0.8256]}
{"prompt":"The writers of cosmopolitan have decided to start a magazine on cooking .","text":"The writers of cosmopolitan have decided to start a magazine on cooking. We had some difficulties in finding an editor and a web designer, who will be able to take on our ideas, and build a project from the scratch. If you\u2019re interested in this project, then you could be the one who takes our challenge.\nFor an application, send your letter of introduction and resume to the contact e-mail below. We will only select candidates that meet the basic requirements. Thank you.\nCold storage is a method of managing food at extremely low temperatures \u2013 about -10\u00b0F in some countries \u2013 in order to preserve food and prolong its shelf life. The storage of products such as meat, poultry, seafood, dairy products, and produce depends heavily on the temperature. When the temperature is lowered to its absolute minimum, most microorganisms die and their activity and reproduction rate are greatly reduced.\nFood storage temperature is controlled with cold rooms or cold stores. Temperature varies from one location to another. The difference in temperature can reach more than 30 degrees Centigrade. The food temperature can be within 0\u00b0C to +4\u00b0C as long as storage and distribution is properly regulated. In a cold chain, food is distributed from one place where it is cold to another place where it is cold. The two main purposes to cold storage are:\nIn cases where the shelf life of the goods is significantly reduced, it is better to have cold storage and avoid unnecessary losses.\nFood safety is a condition in which food remains in a good condition during the storage and transportation period and does not cause any harm to the consumer. Food safety can be achieved by preventing the bacteria growth in foods. One of the most important elements in ensuring food safety is the reduction of microbial flora growth in products. This can be done using either chemical preservatives or physical agents such as temperature, time and water activity.\nCold storage can reduce the amount of microorganisms that grow on the food. This storage process reduces the development of microorganisms. The main microorganism that reduces the quality of foods is the mold. However, it will lose water content due to desiccation. The loss of moisture will weaken the fibers and proteins. Some bacteria, on the other hand, can live longer and cause food spoilage. In cold storage, the spoilage bacteria are significantly reduced, even if the foods are in a closed position.\nThe reduction of microorganisms in foods and water helps prolong the storage shelf life and preserve food quality. The quality of fruits and vegetables is affected significantly by their storage. It can lose its original flavor, taste and appearance, which significantly reduce the quality and reduce the value of the commodity. The purpose of this storage is to preserve nutrition, safety, and other properties of the product.\nThe storage is done by keeping foods in temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0C to -4\u00b0C to retain the quality of the commodity. The main point to emphasize here is that in cold conditions, the microbial growth is stopped and water does not evaporate. The cold storage helps the food quality to be maintained at a satisfactory level.

{"prompt":"You fool , what have you done !","text":"You fool, what have you done! I had a thousand roubles I lent him and this he was taking!\nMy dear boy, the landlord has been waiting for you ten minutes in the little entrance! Where, God! where have you gone? Oh My God! I almost lose it all! \u201d\n\u201cYes, if I could only have gone to the country or far away, away, away.. I could sleep! But here.. I can\u2019t sleep! Oh God! how I\u2019ve been suffering? how I\u2019ve been suffering.. I thought my God, my God.. I should never come back.. What shall I do? where shall I go?\n\u201cGod! my head and neck is stiff ; it hurts me to be so stiff. The cold pains come to me and I find it hard to stand up even. I go to my husband : he is not there, the landlord is not there ; I go to the master, he is not there, the head steward is not there.. I see the coachman and the housekeeper with their faces turned to me ; I do not want them to come in. I can\u2019t stand there anymore, I go away ; I can\u2019t stand there anymore, I leave the house ; I want to escape ; I want to go home! \u201c\n\u201cGood heavens! what have I said! I want to leave it all behind me! my husband, my master and my coachman and that house!\n\u201cYes, well, what shall I do next? Where shall I go? I take money from there, I get a gown from here. I could get you some clothes, the house is so near! Let us go home together ; let us have some fried potatoes, our heads and necks are stiff, we are so stiff that we have no breath to speak! But where are they taking us? who knows where ; we should have been taken to the dungeon. Perhaps to the jailhouse.\n\u201cYes.. to my husband\u2019s house and there at bedtime I should have been chained. That would have been better! \u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, come inside, stay a bit here,\u201d said the old man ; but when he looked at Misha, he said as much of her.\nIt was dark and cold even in that house ; and the landlady, who had kept the house for more than half a year, was just going out to the house next door.\nThey turned on the kerosene, lit a candle and she took off her cloak and said as much of Misha\u2019s life.\n\u201cWhy, Misha, do you want to go to the dungeon. Are you not happy here? Who would look at you and say that you are poor? What shall I do with you? I couldn\u2019t get you any money, perhaps next week. But where shall I go with you? oh, how I am tired! It feels as if I can\u2019t bear any more ; let us go home. \u201c","token_len":642,"entropy":[10.927,2.0125,4.3636,4.0558,0.7594,0.4523,4.7427,2.2116,4.4886,2.2133,5.8182,8.2025,0.2481,5.7609,6.3817,3.8586,2.7609,5.4757,5.0526,3.6633,5.139,3.2005,2.7133,9.5088,2.6333,3.4721,0.4658,4.1504,7.0002,2.4332,2.5383,5.2467,0.7107,0.97,6.4636,1.6231,4.3123,1.1344,6.6169,8.2238,3.5563,4.5829,4.5822,6.5873,3.5118,2.6018,3.0235,0.223,1.6916,1.0004,4.1068,8.2879,0.6656,0.4921,2.3361,7.3791,6.7736,1.667,4.1303,0.8742,12.4713,9.4628,1.1479,3.8538,6.2579,5.1988,0.2987,5.1649,1.8801,2.4705,3.0233,3.4668,4.7069,1.8753,1.1507,8.1251,5.3866,6.8171,1.0326,1.4631,7.6735,2.5724,1.7184,8.3266,3.2296,2.4534,7.4669,3.3464,3.5228,5.0126,7.0558,2.1076,2.6095,12.3573,7.1373,4.6125,2.5664,1.0798,3.1478,2.7049,0.5194,4.1727,3.3472,5.5086,0.9597,3.1278,1.5624,5.9474,5.3595,6.8903,1.0778,0.8214,0.0751,0.1605,0.3867,2.8332,4.4196,2.1979,5.7764,3.5252,5.3741,2.8563,2.3016,0.5055,2.8232,1.5325,5.46,3.473,4.39,1.879,2.9587,4.6781,4.1341,0.1129,0.2084,1.0127,6.878,1.2928,0.042,0.2095,0.4568,2.4121,2.4119,1.0394,5.5754,1.706,3.7585,8.301,4.3463,3.4745,4.7,6.274,7.8485,3.8829,2.1716,3.5857,1.9447,3.1414,1.899,3.9812,1.8882,5.2588,5.1179,7.5877,4.6156,2.8529,0.9098,3.1565,0.8,5.8661,1.7665,1.0979,0.1647,2.9048,2.2431,5.9898,4.2463,1.4388,4.0628,0.9553,2.1462,5.0336,7.4866,2.4829,1.3541,3.824,2.2814,1.6742,4.6417,2.086,0.8185,1.852,0.3936,4.8094,1.6424,2.408,0.4772,1.6076,7.1267,1.7598,1.8948,0.2939,0.769,0.1041,1.4294,2.0759,7.1337,8.785,0.0051,0.4696,0.1777,0.038,3.4984,1.5496,4.4338,2.1194,8.6201,1.8508,2.7553,1.8295,5.0178,0.4876,4.9187,1.4754,3.0535,3.6733,1.8384,1.5373,4.3103,1.1215,4.1534,0.1337,2.6966,2.9563,0.482,2.1336,2.8753,1.5807,1.3568,4.3339,4.4927,0.2268,0.0041,1.1871,3.7739,3.398,1.9304,0.7703,3.5437,4.1573,3.3468,0.7783,3.2321,0.4496,0.0207,0.0021,0.3805,0.8088,0.8712,1.242,0.3154,3.0462,1.9916,0.8775,3.2658,0.4447,5.6752,0.4259,5.5553,3.8009,0.4017,0.865,0.1214,1.3629,1.8868,2.6711,2.6878,2.5813,2.0446,1.2673,0.204,5.4451,3.7123,0.8277,2.393,2.2529,1.0482,6.0204,2.115,1.7413,3.1766,0.2473,2.6795,4.2522,1.2234,2.635,1.5415,1.2504,4.9429,3.2943,2.5227,1.423,4.7701,2.534,1.0411,5.8858,0.1813,2.6671,5.4304,4.4071,5.0718,2.3558,1.8993,0.0596,3.3352,0.2856,4.2138,0.5166,3.3707,3.0947,0.0878,0.0946,5.445,0.5312,4.7589,0.4219,0.0424,0.0463,0.4784,1.797,6.5777,7.8319,1.3668,5.112,1.4679,1.3515,3.9075,2.0134,9.5724,1.5221,2.7085,2.2333,1.185,6.3329,4.1433,4.5171,2.8163,1.3253,1.5501,5.5528,3.2318,2.773,3.6402,7.7679,3.8964,5.027,3.1236,0.4667,3.2137,2.9654,3.8065,2.0146,0.2045,4.4423,1.9921,10.316,3.2987,1.5599,5.7865,5.0302,3.2874,0.9685,1.6119,3.3181,1.6325,1.9665,2.0387,2.5854,3.8375,3.3035,1.3528,3.1758,2.1392,2.9438,3.3228,2.6433,3.1994,4.3263,3.741,2.2662,3.9803,6.1749,0.6559,0.7012,6.2596,3.5282,2.0359,8.6835,2.7382,3.9769,2.317,2.9174,3.2795,2.5451,1.0939,6.8621,2.1748,6.7456,5.8114,0.7264,3.9399,6.3618,1.9093,1.5454,1.0519,0.0304,2.2814,5.5083,5.0238,4.517,2.7684,5.8823,0.2876,6.025,1.582,3.3173,3.4961,6.372,5.4549,0.7623,2.0957,3.9043,1.4898,2.3543,7.7208,2.4531,4.3424,1.8312,0.2139,0.4349,3.0776,3.0576,2.2495,2.4255,0.4935,0.8803,0.024,2.0299,0.4344,3.805,0.6174,6.4814,5.4637,1.8456,3.2421,5.2395,2.902,4.349,1.4721,6.2084,5.0942,8.2932,1.5868,4.914,0.4887,4.0558,4.09,4.5553,3.1251,5.0641,1.43,10.9434,6.3573,0.9119,0.9512,1.952,6.5673,2.6763,5.5637,3.4364,3.514,1.2026,5.1289,1.3639,5.3446,2.456,2.338,7.4862,1.6187,2.5689,3.0951,2.0804,2.935,2.3653,7.3625,5.6197,0.0007,2.6745,2.0987,1.8945,5.5767,2.0294,2.5363,3.3611,4.8114,0.0102,3.2975,0.5591,0.694,0.3102,2.0259,5.5892,4.0637,2.0622,1.4244,2.786,3.2814,6.7032,0.2917,1.0853,1.4161,4.4778,5.4011,2.9477,0.5527,8.717,1.3544,0.0002,4.0675,4.2734,2.7215,1.5247,0.7666,5.7168,3.6727,2.6285,0.5302,3.6734,1.292,5.1892,4.3574,1.1217,1.6621,2.5105,0.005,5.965,0.5831,0.1286,4.2134,2.6192,0.6852,2.7139,0.119,4.4519,1.4493,3.5868,0.0026,0.842,3.7621,0.1061,1.9037,0.4137,1.3993,1.5016,0.6364,2.1384,4.4303,4.3856,0.0812,3.444,5.3932,3.1409,0.7317,5.9103,2.9886,5.8808,0.5737,0.7517,2.0607,0.9167,2.3326,0.8765,1.0681,4.4704,0.9863,3.2153,3.054,0.4049,0.1725,3.165,1.1604,0.6563,2.0468,6.758,1.6629,0.1258,0.008,4.1894,2.9408,1.7837,2.2199,1.6118,7.1404,7.6237,1.7869,1.7712,2.4537,4.3256,1.2693,0.3061,0.0593,5.7335,0.7205,0.6226,6.7951,1.2453,3.5128,1.878,2.1404,3.7272,2.0483,4.4471,4.3554,2.8557,0.2719,0.6585,4.1115,3.3964,0.1154,0.0244,3.6313,3.92,0.7789,4.0974,5.243,1.0325,0.2778,1.8722,3.1165,2.6863,2.1724]}
{"prompt":"Science has created a drug that can find traumatic memories and destroy them , making it to where the person who took the drug never knows it happened . You just woke up in a hospital with no memories at all .","text":"Science has created a drug that can find traumatic memories and destroy them, making it to where the person who took the drug never knows it happened. You just woke up in a hospital with no memories at all. You are perfectly sane. Now look at the side effects;\n1. Dysregulation, 2. Delusions ( you were abducted), 3. Depression, 4. Anxiety, 5. Inability to fall asleep, 6. Persecutory thoughts, 7. Delusion that you are not just alive but that you have more than one life, 8. Not seeing and hearing that everything was real, but still being unable to go back to sleep. You are no longer able to see the truth.\nThis is just a very small taste of what these medications do to you, and the numbers of side effects can go on forever. These side effects are for a very good reason; but that is not to say you should be afraid to take the drug, but if you do use it just be prepared for what will come when you use it. My friends took this drug, and you see me now with two perfectly healthy children and a very good relationship with my husband. But before this drugs it took four surgeries and two years in a psych ward for me to reach my point of recovery.\nIt hurts to look at that picture, but it is now part of the past. I have overcome this trauma, these medications and my PTSD. We have had a very successful life together for three years and this is what my parents wanted for us. I can be a mother to my children and a single parent to my husband. There is no judgement here, we are just human beings, all of us. The good news is that these drugs exist and are being used by people who need them even though the side effects that come up can be debilitating.\nI am going to be honest with you and tell you that I have always found some people to be really weird. I know, I am really weird too. Some days are better than others but I know what you understand about living with illness. Now, as a matter of fact, I have two daughters who are just the same. They have ADD and I have told them to tell you this is how they get along. Sometimes it works wonderfully, other times it is the opposite, or they will do something and it will work but they will do it again and I will catch them doing it and it ends up like that. We both have the same illness as a matter of fact. The only difference is the fact that my girls have been lucky enough to have health insurance so they know how to get the right drugs for them to work properly. There is always a difference between how a medication works for people and what works for us and we must learn to live with that. I can say for sure that the medication will work for you, and you must take it if you choose to.\nWe are just human beings living with a great illness and like us, our doctors and nurses take the drugs too. If you take the drugs then good for you, but if you do not then it is a privilege and not a curse.","token_len":642,"entropy":[5.5487,5.0184,0.9772,7.9523,1.052,2.017,7.315,10.5142,2.8394,2.0192,7.284,0.5082,2.1695,3.9018,1.0575,7.4118,5.8875,2.4549,3.0988,2.8253,4.1944,1.1934,0.8621,4.9523,5.3958,3.4233,2.993,0.4181,6.275,4.655,8.5135,0.0488,1.8762,1.2845,2.1792,1.9333,3.1154,2.8476,3.6145,0.0072,0.7016,2.7063,3.4764,7.7435,3.696,1.2467,4.5321,5.9851,0.4959,1.7174,5.1585,0.4039,5.3839,4.7838,8.3877,0.7999,6.4958,4.5212,3.3683,6.9078,0.0693,5.7333,2.627,5.183,10.1303,3.9994,7.1598,3.9101,0.201,0.0038,4.2658,0.64,0.0932,0.0017,2.5678,0.4443,0.0493,0.0021,5.1578,1.2918,0.0338,7.1348,0.2618,0.8091,0.3038,0.0023,5.5318,3.3741,6.1378,4.746,0.6065,0.2005,0.0028,5.4314,1.7074,5.1933,1.0341,1.3074,3.1918,5.812,5.381,2.1862,2.1074,0.2918,2.2514,5.9287,2.156,0.8571,3.2714,1.5497,0.4247,0.0057,6.667,4.5453,4.7346,0.9998,4.8278,5.2677,4.1367,4.5326,0.7672,4.7488,3.5835,3.9054,4.0711,0.0089,5.0681,1.7709,0.741,1.4346,1.135,3.4833,1.4627,5.0435,0.2513,2.5778,0.0065,2.2672,2.1354,3.664,0.9981,1.3652,3.5852,1.0757,3.6531,1.8204,3.5827,2.599,6.2503,0.3125,0.8803,4.9592,3.9323,3.1634,0.7019,1.7103,2.1814,1.1938,2.962,6.7963,2.7408,5.0915,0.023,2.6067,3.1953,3.3431,3.2127,0.272,4.0647,4.2364,0.0088,1.0675,6.5043,2.9471,1.8291,4.1004,0.0279,2.7837,5.4462,4.5287,1.5405,1.6177,2.2244,0.1142,2.8417,0.7952,3.1558,2.1028,2.1339,0.6824,3.4609,2.4541,1.8528,3.1714,2.6014,0.2384,1.5657,5.2571,1.5213,6.4788,3.41,2.4608,1.095,3.132,2.7212,2.0666,4.3569,0.7728,3.911,0.4906,0.5285,6.7678,4.1159,7.0639,2.3499,1.5054,2.5918,0.7023,4.9161,6.0924,5.3878,3.597,3.1447,4.8624,7.5875,1.4424,1.3174,2.6908,1.6795,2.973,3.5489,4.0178,1.1403,0.9587,2.3004,0.5661,4.6255,4.8842,4.4423,5.3008,6.597,3.6233,6.3199,7.3119,1.7653,3.1764,1.9512,4.762,1.6341,5.7894,0.3769,2.848,2.026,0.1609,5.7642,1.4762,5.5507,0.4568,4.563,0.3756,1.8658,3.8613,6.9406,1.6613,5.0777,0.7452,4.2062,1.3973,1.5563,0.6248,2.0393,0.8648,6.586,5.6122,0.0074,2.1832,5.3284,0.7645,1.8914,2.1206,6.4786,2.3704,4.0081,1.4874,8.0001,5.3794,2.1168,3.4282,5.9341,0.8136,4.1789,1.7027,3.5032,2.0616,2.8211,2.6123,2.9181,1.4734,4.5669,4.1235,0.4373,2.8802,3.8562,1.4274,2.2343,4.642,3.7869,4.869,2.5682,0.9298,0.6928,1.8862,3.4538,4.5417,2.9385,4.2017,1.6629,1.4563,1.4638,1.3896,2.5236,6.7921,1.6163,0.6935,0.7499,1.2183,0.8997,4.7278,0.6433,0.9962,8.596,3.0669,1.154,3.6143,1.0249,2.2804,3.7461,0.266,1.813,5.2137,0.7309,0.0857,1.1622,3.522,5.1124,0.2921,0.0994,0.5095,3.6678,0.8949,7.9416,1.5836,2.4074,2.5902,0.7203,2.1779,1.7122,1.0249,3.1803,0.896,7.2911,2.1131,3.1423,3.7317,0.0351,5.0641,3.0733,6.3803,3.5464,0.667,4.1987,0.4876,1.2025,2.072,1.5636,3.4863,0.0948,2.8349,2.0466,0.9279,0.0365,2.8482,1.3179,0.0604,0.9931,1.3932,1.9487,4.3667,4.8868,5.474,2.3023,2.3123,0.2897,3.8289,5.6087,1.2287,1.0781,3.1735,3.9895,1.2519,2.5132,5.4068,1.1679,5.5349,0.5904,4.2087,4.4692,3.7978,2.8855,0.2384,0.0917,4.3951,1.5347,3.3132,3.3893,3.0971,6.6313,3.5913,7.1792,1.0491,6.4864,0.8338,6.439,1.7255,4.1264,1.8512,5.1769,0.004,0.099,0.2668,0.8227,1.5243,5.9199,3.5653,1.8505,0.7673,3.7947,5.4333,1.2444,2.0263,1.7932,2.0324,7.2311,1.0073,3.3588,0.7354,6.9663,0.2125,2.173,5.1479,3.1621,3.7291,3.0781,3.9489,1.3818,4.5748,2.8453,0.9135,4.799,2.4897,4.6756,7.9932,1.4954,1.949,0.0115,0.5324,2.4907,5.035,1.2493,2.519,4.1915,3.2632,3.6068,4.3902,2.1531,3.6142,2.2092,1.8439,3.9655,2.8866,1.9896,1.0436,3.8638,0.5547,4.8986,0.9647,4.8768,1.4742,7.668,0.8765,2.7552,0.5944,2.5081,2.607,6.8503,0.7031,4.2323,3.6019,0.4035,4.2803,3.4941,1.4838,3.5928,0.2515,6.7252,4.9119,2.0756,5.149,0.0017,0.0488,1.018,3.5522,2.806,1.7648,0.2371,3.1271,3.1653,0.154,3.1893,5.6752,1.9856,2.7485,5.7629,1.7942,0.1074,1.1834,5.4539,0.467,2.8809,1.4772,3.3846,2.0084,0.364,1.8851,3.3295,4.7925,2.8003,2.5473,1.2058,4.3267,3.736,3.8478,0.4906,4.7101,0.7612,4.1413,1.3133,3.4209,1.2715,4.1317,2.93,5.3594,0.1227,3.1967,3.9895,0.6097,2.4816,1.8652,0.0563,2.7765,3.3484,2.8962,4.5602,3.5142,0.5496,1.7675,0.3563,1.1934,0.7555,2.1884,3.5843,3.281,4.0326,0.9624,0.3382,2.7782,3.8566,3.4716,0.9651,0.394,2.5028,1.5106,2.0472,2.5706,3.3883,2.8426,0.6309,3.0858,0.1169,4.2233,0.5888,1.0156,1.0295,4.2424,1.6892,3.434,3.2049,0.0569,4.8345,1.9994,2.3179,4.1184,2.2028,1.6518,6.8107,4.8014,1.1429,3.4165,3.7566,2.4214,1.1404,4.6435,2.5453,3.4089,6.0243,0.4606,3.4216,0.5662,2.4925,1.4076,1.744,4.6782,7.2563,1.858,0.0352,1.0226,1.4044,0.7678,0.2977,1.5615,0.2253,2.7621,2.1196,1.0929,2.6868,8.2038,2.2481,3.1577,0.6107,6.7978,0.4032]}
{"prompt":"Humanity has long forgotten their origins and purpose . Now , many centuries later , our creators have returned .","text":"Humanity has long forgotten their origins and purpose. Now, many centuries later, our creators have returned. In order to save ourselves from perishing, humanity must fight to keep the truth at bay. It is time for Humanity to regain its rightful place.\n\u201cHe who is true to himself must not have his eyes blinded by an empty form, and it is not the power of man that can protect them from this.. \u201d\nIt must be said that I will never forget this passage... and that despite many years of studying, being convinced... and even having some experiences... I still will never have the certainty of this passage. Somewhere in my memories is this story of a child asking what is the difference between an angel and a baby.\nWhat are the things that have led to this situation? What happens when a child, who is already \u201ccreated\u201d and born to a woman ( the mother of mankind ), starts playing and getting close to other children and even the animals ( as well as the trees, the plants, etc ).?\nThis is the first time I will ever see this. I will never forget that day and that moment. I will never forget the feelings.\nWhy? I do not know, but I know that I cannot live in harmony with the world around me if I do not believe the things that happen here and now. I have to believe. I feel that there is nothing else I can do. I have to believe.\nI read from the Bible that this place is the Garden of Eden. I read that Eve was the first woman who was created and when she was turned over by God, he gave the permission for \u201cman\u201d to live freely in this place as well.\nThis is really a fascinating experience because here we are surrounded by the most beautiful women you can imagine and even some men too, I guess, but I do not notice this difference.\nOne day, God said to Eve, \u201cBe fruitful and have many children \u201d and Eve obeyed, so she began to have children.\nThese angels are not really human, but they do look like humans because they still have hair on their head.\nThe more children Eve had, the more beautiful Eve became. In fact, these angels were not only beauties on earth but beauties in Heaven. This is something that I like not so much because I like to be on earth, which is the same for them.\nSome of these angels did something bad and they went away, so Eve was a little upset and said to Adam and God, \u201cwe have sinned. We have made a mistake \u201d and this is why Eve started to have problems in this place, in this garden where she had been created.\nAdam was not aware of anything because he did not see these things but God had already seen something bad.\nAdam believed something that Eve had said, so the situation began to get difficult with them because it soon started to rain.\nSo God decided to give man knowledge for the first time, so man began to make tools to cut trees, eat plants, use water and have animals around him for food.","token_len":643,"entropy":[7.4122,3.3745,3.9808,8.3124,5.2334,3.7135,2.0029,7.4161,1.1016,4.7431,1.0759,4.5891,4.3875,0.6749,0.0575,4.2831,7.7351,1.52,4.1591,2.7472,3.5948,4.0366,0.061,3.3721,5.704,0.8717,9.012,0.2216,0.8921,2.6495,1.0502,4.3888,1.5852,3.9876,1.6588,5.5837,6.029,0.7608,0.3681,4.0535,0.8534,2.2886,1.1974,3.9841,0.1748,6.2104,0.7866,2.2051,0.0943,4.3574,1.1346,13.5614,8.4506,9.2014,3.5969,2.9347,4.7225,1.5498,1.4984,1.6354,2.9376,5.2578,3.7764,5.1699,3.5333,0.293,4.6441,5.003,7.1911,1.672,2.1716,4.5917,0.2748,3.0016,3.183,5.6226,0.5086,4.9629,1.1217,3.4454,4.942,4.1642,1.3459,4.1328,9.4112,2.307,5.6433,1.8811,4.8483,4.4745,0.3563,1.4533,0.5272,3.4851,4.5958,2.9877,1.6566,2.6775,7.6703,4.7629,4.0559,1.8453,6.827,5.0446,2.3205,0.3334,5.0976,2.1715,6.1436,5.9979,5.9095,2.5603,3.3905,3.9772,3.9334,6.2961,2.777,0.6109,2.2147,5.4397,0.6564,4.3315,1.2286,6.3585,1.6893,3.8597,3.0596,0.8245,9.5461,1.2871,1.8578,5.1833,4.4394,3.0969,5.9074,1.1192,1.7681,3.5503,7.846,4.6995,3.0744,2.0825,4.2406,0.0231,3.6663,2.9046,0.1548,0.3462,5.9893,0.9482,2.1161,4.5341,3.5545,1.2723,4.1075,0.6615,3.6807,5.0643,2.2184,0.7356,4.029,0.3211,2.1928,5.6258,0.8543,1.9832,1.0303,4.3136,2.4406,1.3898,4.7442,14.9569,2.8254,6.1015,0.6958,5.0112,2.3,5.3524,2.9793,1.3457,3.508,4.743,9.2142,3.0526,2.009,4.5208,1.5281,5.8771,5.9896,3.9624,5.74,4.9797,0.171,4.7673,0.8847,2.9526,4.3977,2.8701,5.0493,3.4944,5.2753,1.6744,0.0549,1.7765,6.5912,2.1854,1.8849,2.7107,0.5826,1.9968,3.5093,5.8537,1.5658,3.4215,1.027,1.5989,3.8953,0.7258,1.2065,3.5674,0.7984,2.4242,2.073,3.063,1.9503,2.1065,0.6537,0.5784,2.7502,4.0736,3.6118,1.9581,2.4929,0.852,1.7258,0.7762,0.3226,0.2145,1.7591,5.7098,4.9252,2.2097,4.7731,2.9308,2.8554,3.4473,0.0524,0.4039,2.3125,0.9414,0.7551,1.9539,0.9092,1.9799,2.9877,4.7234,2.6545,5.8065,0.1326,1.7391,2.812,2.9109,0.0297,4.8042,0.2351,1.5938,0.0173,4.1364,3.6184,3.5333,0.8476,5.3702,4.3997,2.5727,1.4379,0.3489,1.6107,3.0403,2.3506,2.0664,3.8649,1.3635,5.7783,1.4789,3.2019,0.4431,2.8227,3.8473,1.9237,0.1345,0.1428,1.2602,1.0031,2.1549,0.1776,0.6316,1.4907,1.4127,1.6383,6.634,5.5382,1.1212,2.8776,2.1139,3.8945,4.8766,1.0457,2.3096,5.0456,0.0968,0.0318,1.0539,1.8243,1.9736,1.5767,6.3639,1.8,2.1174,2.3515,1.5963,2.8961,2.0212,2.9301,2.6742,6.3457,0.7471,1.3275,5.5008,4.2875,3.7792,1.0859,1.0851,3.6427,2.0626,4.0509,8.3529,1.8154,15.143,0.4238,5.1946,3.3872,5.0895,0.2802,3.6303,5.4946,1.6527,0.8828,0.7828,4.9086,1.38,0.8592,1.457,2.5232,0.6029,6.3493,2.8936,5.8736,3.7184,4.1179,5.5182,1.6041,0.7835,5.6187,0.1136,2.4993,3.9374,0.9115,4.2113,4.9618,1.8145,0.8221,2.957,4.2263,2.948,3.7683,6.8747,2.7793,3.8786,3.9329,2.544,1.7582,1.7015,2.8802,0.5151,8.6871,2.4079,5.6171,1.0627,1.3611,5.2375,1.9628,1.0519,5.413,3.4183,0.8941,1.8652,0.7326,3.7867,1.2713,6.2247,2.2219,0.3903,8.6155,6.5858,0.1213,3.6907,3.871,1.6223,3.7749,8.7479,0.0031,2.2257,4.4696,1.3257,3.5143,0.6405,3.1371,1.439,0.8201,1.3051,5.7228,7.9546,2.2622,2.3146,5.0738,2.7325,1.4029,0.96,1.0163,3.4862,3.5903,1.0586,1.3026,4.7819,0.7019,7.4153,1.0973,5.5073,1.8794,0.1088,2.3227,1.091,1.2252,2.7725,5.6151,3.6024,3.6445,0.7724,0.305,0.0333,0.362,3.385,4.4431,0.7514,0.4669,4.8036,1.46,0.1222,4.3918,0.4243,1.5717,3.0208,3.527,6.8772,0.1193,5.2237,3.145,1.2102,5.4884,0.0436,1.3048,3.1997,0.6328,3.9436,0.8965,4.2115,0.5469,2.1265,5.6654,7.013,4.8582,0.0252,1.8053,1.1444,3.6082,1.7351,3.0555,4.8305,3.0477,1.479,5.9093,0.4918,3.0174,3.3536,2.5048,5.059,1.1002,0.6461,5.2729,1.459,1.5222,0.1958,4.2771,6.2447,5.9509,2.5742,2.1442,4.388,3.7587,1.9923,3.4012,4.6232,2.1776,4.13,1.7013,4.4138,1.7288,3.6203,0.9977,5.5822,4.1523,6.1514,0.1569,0.4399,0.3569,4.5329,2.5953,5.3747,0.0083,2.5962,2.3684,0.8827,4.0872,1.7635,1.0942,3.5524,1.5384,1.0488,3.5967,0.5477,2.0956,5.8988,6.3067,0.993,1.7696,5.6938,3.5374,1.9528,1.6565,2.7138,4.6453,1.0107,2.8481,4.5511,2.1525,2.2951,1.973,2.4074,0.5824,0.3053,3.7316,2.4512,2.9639,4.938,0.5727,5.2299,4.108,0.4105,2.2943,0.0266,2.4464,4.3489,3.1183,4.7997,2.8093,3.4823,3.5841,3.4911,4.6468,3.1231,1.6611,0.6872,2.5952,5.0172,5.541,2.3359,2.6984,1.4494,2.3528,2.0558,2.9073,3.9628,6.9998,4.1794,0.4636,2.2017,5.3626,6.1121,4.5741,3.8971,3.3463,7.3209,4.867,0.2007,4.0468,1.1774,0.5813,3.2698,2.9124,3.1558,0.4318,2.2778,7.0448,7.7895,5.1937,1.8166,0.503,0.0028,1.9266,1.9054,4.6214,2.4968,0.1649,4.464,6.8184,2.251,4.3221,2.3331,1.6979,4.6262,2.1552,0.4059,5.1097,3.7751,1.6529,5.4005,5.5515,4.7654,0.7858,4.2872,1.404,0.4799]}
{"prompt":"You are an assassin . A little girl has just come up to you , handed you all her pocket money and asked you to kill her abusive relative .","text":"You are an assassin. A little girl has just come up to you, handed you all her pocket money and asked you to kill her abusive relative. As you turn to leave, she jumps behind, snatches the bag with her money, and tears it to shreds. Suddenly you realize that she is bleeding badly from her mouth. What do you do?\n. In an airport, a guy is trying to get onto a plane. It is a crowded plane and he cannot pass. A woman in a suit is in the aisle beside him. She walks by, takes a seat, and then turns around and opens her jacket. She says to the fellow in the aisle that he must be on the bus because he cannot get on. Suddenly another guy walks by, sits down, opens his jacket, puts his hands under his jacket, tucks them into his trousers and then leans over into the aisle next to the woman in the jacket. \"Excuse me? \" says the man in the jacket. \"Can I take your seat? \" The man turns around and says, \"Thanks very much. Please close that jacket up again. \" The man in the suit says as he closes his jacket, \"If my wife sees this she will go into hysterics.\"\nAn extremely nice young Asian boy came to the store where I was working as a cashier (no, I was not his father, nor his grandfather, or even any of his family). The boy was very well dressed, and had a shiny haircut.\nAt one point, the boy looked at the TV where we were watching the news and said something like, \"I want to look at the weather in New York.\"\nMy friend and I were in a car the other day on a road. It wasn't busy, we were on the right side of the road. Suddenly we saw a young father holding his baby crying. He was standing in the middle of the road because his car was running on two tires. We could hear his little boy saying to him, \"Dad, I'm scared of the monster under the table in my room.\"\nOne day I was in a line of people to get in my car and a man came up from behind and held onto me and shouted at me like crazy. I thought he was going to kill me, but he just kept on shouting and finally he just turned around and said \"I'm your driver.\" I was stunned, because I thought he had just been having a bad day and thought he still wanted to be my driver.\nOne time my Dad was driving and saw a man running down the road with a red jacket on and he stopped and wanted to take the man some money. He told him he didn't have any money and he couldn't give him any. The man just reached up and grabbed the cuffs on the seat. My Dad had to put his hands into the manels to unbutton them. My Dad didn't want the man to steal his shirt, so he had to put his hands up by the cuffs on the seat. My Dad had to do that for almost two blocks and the man put his arms back down and walked away.","token_len":643,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,8.3776,1.6026,3.9781,6.3769,2.8474,4.4176,3.992,3.3075,3.0643,0.7829,0.8483,1.9864,8.7626,0.6417,6.5964,1.949,8.9934,1.7037,1.6818,2.8846,0.8304,0.3607,3.2946,0.1295,12.6051,8.0172,0.5277,4.6424,0.9948,5.5313,1.8334,2.8504,0.3421,1.1411,5.339,6.4693,5.3954,6.6929,0.767,1.9248,3.6931,4.7609,0.8349,9.7708,0.9593,0.4278,8.0445,1.0351,2.79,0.7048,0.0013,0.3378,5.4252,2.2996,2.2247,0.868,1.4388,1.2663,6.5341,2.0184,1.057,1.4866,3.006,0.9969,4.3508,2.7818,0.0334,0.1326,0.2204,2.5556,10.2558,5.5543,3.862,8.1678,1.502,2.4724,4.3925,2.4177,3.0113,0.0211,2.0244,5.3248,0.7578,0.5302,0.9934,3.882,1.8544,2.0895,5.2751,3.6707,1.9425,1.5572,4.9561,3.7572,2.1313,3.2978,2.5497,2.8686,0.9173,2.9168,2.197,3.6994,0.9575,2.5737,5.4997,0.3249,0.9818,1.054,4.8749,4.1407,2.1283,3.9225,1.309,1.9094,0.9964,0.5412,3.4179,3.5931,1.2756,1.5259,5.52,1.3257,4.8369,0.9288,1.3139,3.4197,2.6209,1.3482,7.4588,1.9519,0.3849,2.2533,2.4851,2.4009,2.6589,1.2574,3.8055,1.3593,5.2855,2.2731,1.0375,3.6185,1.8685,1.4346,1.0272,4.793,4.7608,2.7315,3.2857,0.8588,1.354,6.5491,0.8604,0.8321,3.9442,0.3098,0.8035,0.2904,4.1364,1.1393,2.3642,4.6446,0.3565,3.2742,0.2348,7.8123,0.8926,2.2833,1.7294,0.2979,3.8739,2.6772,3.0004,4.9643,2.0138,5.8353,0.6222,1.2566,3.6314,0.0163,2.1568,2.0208,2.0257,0.2062,3.0598,0.3919,4.1626,4.6687,0.0031,0.0395,3.0315,7.0167,4.1791,0.2429,1.0305,1.4257,0.0704,0.5052,0.5231,0.7475,4.9055,0.8056,3.5452,2.0524,4.0155,2.2424,1.2081,3.0455,1.4136,3.2527,1.2821,0.6257,2.7764,0.691,0.1023,6.0203,5.7235,0.0042,1.1885,4.3861,7.5096,5.0585,2.8556,2.6758,4.8866,1.2631,2.4603,1.3397,1.3848,2.142,0.0184,3.8145,2.4513,5.955,0.3453,3.5409,0.4947,0.33,1.2128,0.5585,4.7477,5.444,3.3203,5.3671,2.7327,4.344,0.8806,4.0226,3.4289,2.6117,0.0382,1.7727,1.5913,6.4567,5.5861,5.7214,3.7631,6.6759,3.6897,5.5292,1.3864,1.7913,4.8751,4.3608,1.1257,1.274,1.8978,4.2123,0.4682,4.8308,0.0254,5.636,4.9005,1.4717,1.4194,2.5617,0.2608,6.4748,3.7763,2.2875,4.8055,2.4726,3.4022,1.3093,2.798,1.9195,4.2289,0.4386,0.6508,3.0905,1.7551,3.0088,2.9955,1.5064,2.4801,4.9873,0.723,1.0535,1.9671,2.4907,1.0328,6.8736,6.8104,0.971,5.6889,4.3928,2.9707,0.5191,0.9702,1.8248,2.8085,4.2517,1.5257,1.3623,6.1592,5.5742,3.0153,0.1881,2.4325,2.0061,4.4227,1.9393,1.3278,3.1268,1.8546,0.6898,0.0734,1.7999,3.3116,0.2419,5.3163,0.2733,1.4084,5.7809,2.9573,3.6189,0.2248,1.9588,2.0732,4.5382,3.1608,1.9681,0.0833,1.6749,2.7889,2.1491,2.7015,6.2332,1.5259,0.3616,4.5738,0.7286,3.5745,5.0888,3.2219,4.4763,0.0019,5.5353,1.3959,4.6425,0.7861,3.0711,1.2057,3.5339,0.5487,0.154,0.3862,0.2381,1.3035,4.4559,2.5587,1.7834,0.924,3.6286,9.5973,4.8744,1.3084,2.9851,6.5809,1.2827,1.4227,1.4202,3.9874,1.5234,1.064,0.9858,0.0165,0.3593,0.117,7.545,1.8338,2.7126,0.5157,2.7483,3.559,4.6944,3.1175,0.461,3.2807,4.34,1.0306,2.5774,5.7511,2.4689,3.8901,2.9414,2.2722,0.3369,0.0176,3.3802,0.2618,1.6794,1.7916,3.918,2.6545,2.1223,7.9506,6.8902,0.6926,5.2649,3.4326,2.1857,3.7542,1.0605,1.4189,4.4517,1.9741,2.1646,1.2179,2.3099,1.1756,6.8221,1.6311,2.0127,6.5952,2.213,4.3448,3.9548,0.5876,1.9646,4.185,2.1353,1.8029,1.347,4.0308,0.6282,1.3723,4.327,5.3998,2.1967,2.6194,6.5917,2.3213,0.1215,4.9871,5.4501,0.5638,1.402,3.3524,1.6147,0.2408,1.6947,0.0636,1.5097,0.2567,1.2758,0.361,1.234,2.359,2.0727,2.2621,2.8117,1.9249,6.1577,1.8406,2.802,3.9952,0.5171,0.1955,1.8818,3.031,2.0408,1.0341,4.3883,6.2087,1.5104,1.4661,1.9984,3.4866,2.215,3.2327,0.8212,1.9937,1.1461,2.2428,1.2379,2.4266,6.8595,0.6906,1.9025,0.9055,1.9667,4.182,1.1898,7.5419,2.1548,0.2168,4.3623,2.6838,0.3406,0.253,1.4129,3.682,2.7401,3.5294,6.5281,1.7226,1.4017,3.7761,5.5159,1.1623,2.4296,4.1107,2.2721,0.3111,1.2532,2.2111,0.5934,4.479,5.7662,2.032,1.7505,2.0553,3.3306,1.3306,7.0251,0.1232,2.7946,2.7489,2.1106,7.7907,4.2409,0.3979,1.3183,3.2808,1.2524,1.8702,3.2017,0.0009,1.833,1.4522,0.6612,1.3738,1.4659,4.1591,0.0002,3.0024,1.8298,1.5584,1.2234,2.3861,0.3734,3.951,7.5132,1.9136,0.3973,1.7629,1.4714,8.1943,1.5736,2.038,1.7798,6.8604,2.8111,4.0143,0.3729,4.1816,2.2606,3.3194,0.8795,1.0751,4.1048,1.2948,5.1059,14.9017,2.1162,6.9663,1.1595,2.6014,0.6795,2.1306,0.2766,4.0762,0.0015,2.0085,2.2681,1.0145,0.2544,6.761,1.6674,4.7823,1.6176,1.1257,0.2489,3.5793,0.3774,1.9978,0.5697,0.5547,2.6191,5.8408,0.8991,1.8558,0.0014,2.7747,0.4469,0.9458,0.5818,1.2954,0.1573,3.1306,0.2929,4.1396,2.1628,1.516,4.9476,2.3329,6.5667,2.421,3.4445,0.5045,5.6775,0.216,3.7799,5.1326,3.0274,1.177,4.4476,1.2009,0.2915]}
{"prompt":"Not a single person noticed that the protagonsit has amnesia , he 's just too good with faking recognition .","text":"Not a single person noticed that the protagonsit has amnesia, he's just too good with faking recognition. Also, it's more like the guy is trying to trick the rest of them so the hero can trick them, and there is no evidence that the rest of the cast know they might be involved. Noticed that?\n\" I was in love with Tasha during the Civil War. I could never forgive the other man. I could never let myself be in such a twisted relationship with anyone again. I've had no idea who he or her are, and I've been working to do so for my entire adult life. I've come to terms with that.\"\nYup, I was hoping that was it - we know the villains are from another timeline, so hopefully it's all gone. They do seem to have a history with each other, though.\nI don't get how the writer would try to write the events in reverse. It's a bit like being at the cinema watching a movie and having a memory of where you were, and then watching it upside down. What was there and what wasn't?\nI think the writer is trying to tell us that these are other characters from some other timeline, as opposed to those who are from the timeline we have seen previously. Or perhaps they are real people from this 'other' timeline who can see the future. It just doesn't add up, but it could be that the writers are trying to avoid giving away too much of the storyline; but the fact the 'future' Tasha is now in the present means that her (future) actions are, or will be, part of our world.\nI mean, unless this is more than just a character's 'point of view', and they are in fact going back in time to try to change the past. It just reads to me as too much work (no pun intended).\nWhat does 'there is no evidence that the others knew he or she might be involved' actually mean? The rest of the cast were there when they saw the two of them; the two of them were chatting up each other on the street, not talking to the other five characters, when they were both shot. The two of them know who the assailants were, and I don't see how they were able to evade the others.\nYeah, the author also told us Tasha is aware of the other heroes, from her memory. She is just trying to convince the reader they aren't. The 'future' Tasha doesn't want to believe that she is the only one who can see this happening.\nIf she's really trying to get these people to stop being involved, why didn't she just tell them who they were? Or better yet, why doesn't she have any new stories to tell us about herself?\nYeah. I agree with a lot of what she was saying - how the two of them met, the fact that they are from a separate era and have a mutual attraction but neither one seems to remember who the other is - but it's so much easier to assume that she is trying to trap them to get the heroes involved.","token_len":643,"entropy":[3.5771,4.5501,2.2715,7.7987,1.7751,1.8021,11.0472,9.145,9.3048,4.7809,10.4967,1.9741,1.9201,5.4688,3.659,2.4208,4.4881,3.7947,4.7635,8.1994,3.4284,9.7105,1.0152,4.9598,0.5117,2.9287,0.9515,4.8721,2.3443,2.8944,5.4392,2.8851,3.095,0.0413,4.1638,1.9414,4.729,0.079,2.6286,4.8038,3.7616,7.467,1.1737,5.1137,1.371,2.5775,2.5292,4.6751,2.0036,0.9555,5.3525,1.1846,2.2293,4.7178,0.2962,0.5894,5.0529,5.1538,5.3704,7.0212,0.7129,5.0073,0.8103,14.1231,1.3799,7.1056,2.5081,7.4791,5.9886,3.5028,4.6026,3.3659,0.1752,6.4097,5.2145,5.1606,1.0045,7.6071,0.0545,1.1295,1.4587,4.9715,2.8892,4.0643,3.6915,5.7613,4.1208,1.5514,1.4997,3.5651,0.4812,4.2154,3.455,1.3834,4.0956,5.0014,0.4299,6.3013,3.3815,0.3335,3.9704,4.9054,0.2663,1.3305,3.7999,2.8965,3.7566,2.6173,2.4433,2.6604,6.7608,3.0194,4.037,1.496,1.561,0.8611,2.079,2.5869,5.8711,2.4891,5.7196,3.7589,0.7881,5.5344,0.4382,3.1893,0.0242,0.3486,1.1567,1.9107,4.9809,0.284,3.401,0.0736,2.1836,4.5121,0.5063,7.0459,2.573,0.6098,2.2263,2.9093,5.832,1.396,4.0472,3.2928,6.1467,5.5356,4.947,2.8953,6.8291,1.4944,5.2151,3.4131,3.4507,0.7714,2.1781,6.3367,2.6128,1.1502,3.2773,5.4394,1.7262,5.5692,5.1986,1.9621,0.4852,1.2501,1.6031,4.1148,1.5344,2.4027,0.0298,0.6462,1.5843,0.7598,1.1403,3.0926,3.1206,0.0006,4.7579,3.3156,2.3863,6.7443,3.5447,5.3338,0.2528,4.2038,3.2595,5.4367,2.6051,6.9858,1.8856,2.5578,0.9421,2.8255,2.3137,1.6025,5.1167,4.7307,1.3584,6.4733,3.0973,1.5999,1.0851,1.972,3.0663,1.2622,6.3725,1.4773,3.5517,0.9739,0.8485,3.2916,1.4533,1.2926,4.1671,1.7051,10.8256,0.0304,1.3989,4.5881,3.2041,4.3771,5.9488,1.1882,3.3153,0.0,3.1661,1.1376,2.6167,2.2714,1.688,3.0122,2.8506,1.9259,0.0363,3.5877,1.5211,1.7177,4.4636,1.9948,5.5932,2.834,2.3219,5.0504,0.9516,0.7835,0.8675,4.9468,1.1417,0.0017,4.5255,1.3355,1.3965,3.4769,1.3762,4.7044,2.4579,3.3203,4.1547,4.207,0.3201,5.5474,3.1086,1.6885,1.4762,4.8923,1.4142,2.5009,4.4271,7.3792,2.5639,0.5477,0.1817,3.1344,4.4564,3.955,1.9892,2.6779,1.6235,3.1083,3.7943,1.7623,0.0005,3.3311,0.1235,2.8654,3.0626,1.553,4.2636,0.736,2.4667,1.8054,2.2622,1.53,0.9205,0.0195,4.9,4.2145,3.7998,1.424,0.1709,1.7311,0.9559,5.7315,6.777,4.5004,3.3645,2.4805,5.4588,5.5051,5.2979,0.0563,8.291,0.0239,1.4239,4.5814,2.0511,2.8455,2.0358,4.1954,1.0005,3.7489,6.5251,5.8856,0.4104,4.0537,1.2645,5.8254,5.0432,2.8197,0.1815,0.1645,3.0038,0.0052,4.2767,3.7832,0.6945,0.9091,2.074,4.3445,0.1787,7.6037,3.8509,0.7853,5.5562,3.205,0.6311,1.0223,5.0609,3.3818,4.4733,7.1268,0.2396,0.0695,0.535,3.3385,3.0855,1.7251,3.6951,3.0595,4.0291,2.4093,1.3339,0.021,1.5054,3.9239,0.9026,3.9362,1.4039,1.4842,2.3491,2.9872,3.8755,8.59,4.5791,0.1103,2.1299,4.6938,1.0153,5.1675,5.5107,5.337,2.302,0.0042,1.4001,0.9209,3.8248,3.1281,5.1091,5.9093,3.0047,1.1844,4.9231,1.5803,0.2625,3.5378,2.3364,5.8169,1.0523,0.1124,4.3053,0.2125,0.1072,0.7905,5.0302,0.0732,0.3403,4.0716,6.0734,0.0523,0.3182,0.8686,4.3125,4.3192,3.2455,2.2633,2.4657,1.3502,5.772,2.5105,0.1068,5.6054,3.3047,3.8629,1.2728,0.0727,1.8841,8.3919,3.4472,1.8016,0.0209,3.4689,0.7647,3.0167,1.3481,4.5451,3.7131,1.1724,4.0496,1.0013,9.6471,3.3655,2.1758,5.048,1.2267,2.5845,3.6923,4.9486,1.2686,2.997,3.3586,0.2788,0.0156,6.117,3.4806,1.6436,9.2876,1.0535,0.8428,1.036,4.4656,2.2137,0.0004,2.8477,1.3692,1.0771,3.7017,1.4433,0.0015,5.9017,1.6918,5.341,1.2557,1.1471,6.3946,0.1892,3.1572,6.5216,5.2764,4.6825,0.794,5.875,0.0047,1.8541,5.9503,0.4123,1.2625,3.5225,4.4904,2.0158,6.8779,2.8216,5.2181,1.1342,3.0391,2.9205,4.4553,2.3697,0.0303,4.3099,2.5272,3.2273,4.4786,3.4863,0.0006,3.9401,3.4261,4.4038,4.2419,0.0894,1.2085,0.0033,4.5091,0.0003,3.0203,0.5261,4.1284,1.8396,1.4475,1.434,2.1643,2.4765,0.3512,1.0619,2.3438,3.0724,2.8625,3.9738,0.8831,1.1514,3.9116,2.2345,2.2498,3.7244,3.235,0.0437,3.0357,4.9914,2.4504,0.3998,3.421,3.1981,3.5809,0.8121,2.7358,2.8959,0.0003,0.5654,1.6227,1.9158,0.6372,4.3053,1.4367,0.9759,1.0944,3.9641,5.8561,0.0867,0.2322,1.0296,4.2249,0.0002,0.2416,3.461,1.7943,7.0538,4.4682,0.8301,0.1475,3.4055,1.0831,4.947,0.5982,0.9336,5.9611,3.3294,1.9378,5.0522,0.935,4.8569,0.2378,0.0111,2.2088,1.5196,3.4116,0.456,2.9069,5.1949,2.8204,3.6279,0.4386,0.0202,4.7329,1.3518,3.2083,2.9096,0.4529,0.7647,2.1749,4.4541,2.751,5.657,6.088,3.0082,2.9279,2.3467,5.8367,4.8835,6.649,5.5787,3.5607,4.7404,0.2946,3.4298,2.7439,2.4053,0.2337,0.7505,3.9447,0.3518,2.2084,1.0979,4.4816,2.0816,2.4686,0.3463,4.984,0.8483,2.5314,1.832,2.5607,0.019,7.2437,1.0509,4.5745,2.538,2.7545,4.028,2.779,0.6358]}
{"prompt":"David Tennant , kidnapped by the Di Ravello Militia to become Propaganda Minister , is freed from captivity by The Rebellion","text":"David Tennant, kidnapped by the Di Ravello Militia to become Propaganda Minister, is freed from captivity by The Rebellion and is sent after his missing son.\nDerek is forced to leave Stilton in order to complete his mission, knowing his life is in danger. It is later revealed that the missing child is in the hands of an evil force known as the \"Three\". The Three take control over the city and use the human body of Derek Stilton to continue their evil plans for earth. After the destruction of the underground city to save themselves from exposure, the Human Resistance is wiped out.\nSince its debut there has not been a Doctor Who episode in recent years that has a theme song. They are as follows \u2013.\nFor two episodes, the Doctor returned to Stilton as part of the set-up before the story. As described in Episode 1, the Doctor has a car crash and wakes up to find himself in an underground city inhabited by a small group of humans who control it. To survive, the Doctor must gain the trust of the city and his fellow humans. The series began in with all 10 episodes of the first season set in Stilton.\nAs of there have been only six episodes in which the Doctor has not been present. The episodes in question were \u2013. The season two episodes featured scenes set in the fictional town of Boreham \u2013.\nBoreham was also referred to occasionally in a story by Roger Smith later in his personal autobiography. This made references to a fictional town that he used to live in in the UK.\nThe production company of the series at the time, BBC Productions, were keen to be involved in the local media, so the episodes featuring Stilton were broadcast on BBC Radio at the beginning of the BBC 2 afternoon programme. Stilton later became a recurring theme through the 1970s. A large proportion of the audience in the early 1980s found the programme too long for their tastes, and some even described the series as dull and repetitious, but it became a favourite with many.\nThey also worked on some non-television projects for the BBC in the 1980s, and in 1993, the theme to the sitcom A Good Job was composed for them to sing the songs in the episode. Since the show had a strong following, there were plenty of merchandise available for fans, which included a range of books written by the show's cast and crew, including script outlines and notes. Also available were sets which the cast wore in some of the episodes.\nA special edition box set, known as the 'Deluxe Edition, was released which featured a CD-ROM including behind-the-scenes scenes of every episode.

{"prompt":"WHERE THE WATERS RUN - MarContest - 8452 words","text":"WHERE THE WATERS RUN - MarContest - 8452 words - Medium - Short - Essay (Essay Writing) How the body will be affected by the pollution in different places is an unexplained world. The body will affect everything from the air to your food and water. Every day all around the world we are surrounded by a massive amount of pollution. Pollution of every kind is becoming a problem.\nThe water is clear, clean and green and it has the cleanest water I have ever experienced. It is also the cleanest in the whole world. I don\u2019t want to get into some serious problems and say pollution is something bad but there are things out there that do happen to people and cause pollution.\nGlobal Pollution. The Human Population. The Global population growth rate has increased from two inhabitants to approximately seven billion worldwide, and that number is increasing rapidly every year. This has led to the pollution of our environment.\nA new study shows that there are over 700 million people without access to clean drinking water, while over 91% of the World's land gets covered with plastic waste each year as plastic pollution spreads.\nHumanity's uncontrolled and unfettered pursuit of resources for gain has cost us far more than the financial damage in terms of life, money and happiness. One resource we see many of us running from is clean air. Pollution is increasing in the world day by day and the reason is the increasing use of modern technology.\nThe world's oceans are being ravaged faster than ever before, but the human species is not doing enough to solve the problem. How do we fix what is wrong? Learn how science is saving oceans with oceanography.\nWorld Population. The human species can be found on the earth at this very moment (2017, April 25). Humans live on earth at this very moment (2017, April 25).\nIt is important that we can do our part by conserving our environment and making sure that all of the Earth's life forms can continue to live together in peace.\nI will be discussing the world in an article. I will be starting with the human side of the world and the different people that live in the world.\nThe Human Race. Humans have been on the planet earth for a really very long time. Humanity has been here almost since the dawn of time. We started as a pack of animals and we evolved to be who we are.\nThe human race has many people, different races, and has many different cultures. The human race is evolving every single day, and some of us think that we are the worst human race this world has ever seen. In reality, we are just human beings that are just trying to survive and make it as normal and productive as possible.\nThe human species cannot survive without human help.

{"prompt":"You have just lost your legs in a heroic deed saving a sleeping shapeshifting Archdruid from an assassin . Sitting in your home ; depressed , a few weeks later , you see a falcon tapping on your window .","text":"You have just lost your legs in a heroic deed saving a sleeping shapeshifting Archdruid from an assassin. Sitting in your home ; depressed, a few weeks later, you see a falcon tapping on your window. He begs you to take him as your apprentice - and learn to fly.\nAfter a couple of weeks you return to see her, and realize that your friend has gone mad. She has become a falcon-hater and sees them as little more than a nuisance.\nAs long as the wind is blowing, she can still fly, but it takes a lot of effort because your friend has made her unable to get a strong enough pull on the string to fly.\nYour friend, though, seems to have made a life for himself from his knowledge. He continues to fly the falcon and has even made friends with the birds. He is very proud of his accomplishment, and you can see that the falcon is now less important.\nOne day you go to the shop and see a young boy about your own age. He asks if he can borrow your friend's falcon. You take it and bring it to the boy and show it to him.\nThe boy takes it into the field and, when you are next in contact with her, she is not. She is gone, and your friend goes mad. You want to kill him. You go back to the shop and take the boy home. She has taken her flight and gone.\nThe boy, though, tries to be patient. He gets her back to the field and you can see that she goes faster and faster. You stay with her and watch her as she flies the falcon. The wind is getting stronger, and you can see, from the boy's point of view that the falcon and the boy are getting closer.\nAs the boy climbs down the tree and starts walking towards the field, the falcon starts to get more and more agitated. She hops like crazy and becomes frantic.\nOne more week later, when you see her again, she flies much faster, so fast that you can't follow her. You take your friend's falcon and fly to the boy and start guiding it back towards the field.\nYou go as close as you dare to the boy, but the falcon is getting faster. You feel that you won't be able to catch her in time.\nYou finally cut the string and take a good look at the boy and the rest of the field. He is gone.\nYou return to your friend the next day, and you find her lying on the ground under the tree. She has been injured.\nYour friend looks up at you from her tomb. You pick up the falcon and fly away. You fly for hours, and it is still dark when you arrive at home.\nThe next day your parents tell you that the boy died last night and that there was nothing they could do.\nYou know the story. You know the events.\nBut you have not seen the falcon in two days.\nYou go and watch it. You walk as far away as you dare. But it is not there.","token_len":645,"entropy":[3.7506,5.0656,4.7759,1.331,8.0607,4.1901,1.4085,9.8596,6.1097,9.8344,1.7877,7.0252,8.1947,3.6598,0.5042,9.6839,4.1174,0.0493,0.0136,2.0864,3.2049,4.2767,1.4815,10.7862,1.7013,1.9912,4.9538,13.2839,15.6191,1.029,5.581,4.5955,3.2301,1.9982,1.0507,1.2851,4.1243,1.4255,9.4432,0.1219,11.0486,2.7275,1.085,3.2652,1.6126,3.7815,7.1913,0.4695,0.277,3.074,1.0625,4.1992,1.1686,4.8582,5.6887,2.3437,8.1806,1.3573,2.4086,0.9026,2.5691,7.9511,1.8958,3.456,0.3119,2.0133,2.4555,3.825,0.4725,7.1073,3.9236,2.0876,1.8213,5.7547,0.9616,2.9731,4.4142,1.799,3.8266,2.6544,0.8658,2.0846,2.3577,3.7691,1.5935,7.4015,0.0085,3.2906,4.5135,1.6138,2.333,7.6357,6.537,1.3813,4.8109,0.4147,0.0045,2.3257,2.2751,0.5227,2.985,3.9728,4.8701,0.0149,3.5247,8.3416,1.2208,1.0158,0.9566,1.901,2.3228,4.0429,1.3167,1.5205,0.9207,2.7572,3.2631,1.4004,1.5679,0.5302,2.3891,6.2271,3.8965,3.8208,2.1747,4.7969,1.6249,7.1528,0.0099,4.6583,2.9332,6.0567,1.593,7.8614,2.1506,1.6643,6.9644,1.6649,1.1073,0.6553,1.3228,3.643,1.0264,3.3791,3.5278,0.3144,3.9109,0.5811,1.5074,4.5657,1.5324,5.8063,0.9503,2.2788,6.0971,3.0139,7.1501,3.4547,1.2921,6.334,0.2849,3.6722,3.8795,1.979,0.0358,2.6297,3.2491,3.2953,3.262,2.8346,0.2153,2.1528,4.623,0.9881,2.0989,2.1977,4.1179,3.5023,0.2577,1.1668,4.6926,0.9748,0.8174,2.6571,2.8737,1.2749,1.5098,3.5797,2.5075,0.0512,1.44,3.4263,6.2896,5.1905,2.9304,0.5777,5.5398,0.539,1.3059,3.8312,0.5179,1.7834,4.2009,1.5842,2.6328,1.1888,3.2417,3.3395,6.2106,3.5758,7.4068,0.09,1.1941,0.8266,3.2712,1.8708,2.2081,0.6005,2.5338,1.6901,3.2035,0.1007,1.5714,0.0166,1.2863,0.6209,3.9485,1.7677,1.1583,4.552,0.3825,0.867,1.8449,4.7539,2.4219,4.1135,3.5989,0.4404,0.1311,0.2999,1.9896,1.9217,0.4664,4.0141,0.7734,5.4953,1.624,5.0417,0.8281,4.8556,2.7517,1.2108,3.08,6.8817,3.7747,6.098,0.3388,5.7801,0.1613,3.7182,2.9388,4.5509,6.8513,1.7324,1.756,5.7435,1.2002,1.0275,3.0249,0.222,4.8551,4.9385,0.7374,1.8929,4.7013,0.2724,3.941,1.9949,1.6911,1.7853,4.5672,2.7179,0.172,1.1635,0.6625,0.6849,3.5432,1.2576,2.1759,3.183,0.607,4.6397,2.6087,3.6324,2.8567,5.5606,1.8277,4.2292,5.523,0.5662,2.6262,1.8039,2.9443,1.5637,0.0528,5.6828,0.1551,4.8663,5.2572,1.6143,0.4427,4.6247,5.0887,2.5606,1.8546,0.9419,3.7475,0.9043,3.7314,3.5255,0.8833,0.8361,1.2329,7.3941,5.7463,1.8859,0.7037,0.6685,1.8897,6.6626,1.2104,0.4336,1.4112,2.267,0.5563,3.6518,0.2222,1.7687,2.8059,0.3318,0.0126,1.0511,3.2514,4.9607,1.0143,4.0821,0.9007,1.3499,0.3721,1.6566,1.5757,0.4467,6.5848,3.134,0.8463,5.0479,0.0631,2.6183,0.0174,0.0005,8.0389,1.5734,2.3636,0.0209,6.0982,0.6786,0.9378,0.4843,4.6478,0.5544,0.798,0.762,3.6591,2.202,2.1886,5.3095,3.4393,1.094,2.2776,2.4382,3.5596,3.9851,1.7998,1.5385,2.8059,0.3527,2.3908,2.474,0.0142,3.7138,1.1536,4.0997,2.966,0.6154,0.0101,3.4466,0.2947,3.8042,6.8561,7.5181,2.4919,1.3459,5.6536,4.9955,0.5633,1.691,5.3561,2.6812,6.2713,3.507,0.8505,3.137,0.8082,3.2494,0.759,1.375,0.3358,0.8928,4.8289,6.6329,0.4458,2.3521,4.0447,2.0648,0.3556,0.9687,1.0242,1.9456,5.4849,0.7639,0.6627,1.4542,3.2878,2.7722,0.5211,2.2197,0.156,0.0119,0.861,2.1196,1.8251,0.8555,4.525,2.1985,4.9616,6.1092,1.7946,3.6827,2.2362,0.5196,0.466,0.2574,0.7956,1.654,3.6436,6.1397,4.8237,0.4129,0.1012,6.9234,0.3778,2.8925,1.7412,1.3806,1.4543,1.9371,1.6401,0.0094,1.8357,3.7732,4.3863,1.3244,1.1447,4.8305,2.6426,1.5708,6.6306,0.0043,0.761,0.0678,0.0021,2.8475,1.2195,2.8833,0.4733,0.9497,1.3977,1.3454,5.2354,7.638,1.1816,6.3677,1.0963,3.4955,3.8968,4.0706,0.6279,0.2986,0.631,0.8354,2.5739,2.1403,6.5115,0.0664,0.3998,5.3152,0.2453,1.2491,0.8339,4.2337,1.0816,0.8093,1.4587,4.4216,0.1638,1.3169,0.6684,5.5878,0.3297,0.49,1.4773,0.4974,2.7064,2.4346,2.1941,4.5752,1.0901,0.4467,0.248,5.4402,1.2233,1.5294,0.5574,1.5383,1.7019,1.942,4.1839,2.5788,1.4248,2.5836,0.0844,4.4773,1.9429,0.9957,0.0553,3.3597,2.1713,9.2588,2.0939,1.8024,6.1051,0.8473,0.905,1.7912,0.0162,0.4176,2.1233,2.762,0.5663,1.8924,3.8504,4.5182,4.5213,1.2475,2.0243,3.895,1.3289,2.7205,4.1853,2.8268,0.1141,3.7479,0.7205,4.7699,0.1273,0.5441,2.7287,0.8811,0.568,2.8829,7.5058,3.5568,0.0589,0.5069,1.9982,1.4196,4.1486,4.8669,0.8251,2.4287,1.1088,3.7573,1.3448,2.2162,2.8944,0.0493,0.029,0.9263,1.568,1.1947,4.4535,2.9959,1.6387,1.939,1.5058,2.9329,1.7103,5.0991,2.1591,1.8588,3.9968,1.1166,2.9222,2.6627,2.1692,1.0807,5.3791,0.0186,2.4679,3.7319,2.4397,0.2829,1.0596,1.2629,2.9906,3.5898,4.7801,2.0739,2.0092,1.3284,4.4018,6.0931,2.0335,2.0392,0.7107,0.1717,4.3195,1.355,4.5742,2.6212,0.6027,2.2741,2.6362,0.2639]}
{"prompt":"You live in a world where everybody is born blind , and the world is built for the blind . One day , you wake up and you see .","text":"You live in a world where everybody is born blind, and the world is built for the blind. One day, you wake up and you see. You say \u2013 my god, I was blind and now I can see. You\u2019re like, wow, I was blind and now \u2026\nIn this section of the world, everything is a beautiful place. Even the grass is green and luscious and long and plucking one single blade and dropping it into water is like a joyous adventure. The birds are so high you can see them from anywhere you stand. Water is cold and refreshing. Everything you see, you find a reason to be thankful.\nOne day, one of these beautiful grass blades has your whole attention. This is good. You say your prayer and thank for the grass you are about to eat, and then thank for the grass that makes the seeds that grow the grass that will give you good grass to eat.\nThis is great. You say your prayer and thank your parents for being like them and for the food you are about to eat, and ask that the food they are about to eat will be good for them.\nSo you stand and thank and praise and offer your praise for the things you see in this life and you move on. This is how you are supposed to walk your life in gratitude. These are the things you should do. These are the things to appreciate. Things that make you happy. Things that make you contented. Things that create joy in your heart.\nBut not all of you have the appreciation to see all of the things that this beautiful world has to offer and for you to see something, you have to learn to look for it. You can see a beautiful sunrise, you can see a beautiful sunset. You can see a beautiful moon rise even though the night before it rained. You can see colorful flowers on the lawns. You can see beautiful trees, and you can see beautiful things happening. You see them around you as they happen. And it\u2019s like you don\u2019t know you were missing those things.\nThere is so much to look for around you, so much beauty to appreciate. I don\u2019t want you to take for granted all that God has given to you. I don\u2019t want you to walk your life in regret when God provided so much for you.\nYou were blind, and in this blindness, you were living in fear. I said the day in which you were born was your darkest day. You were in fear, not knowing what to do, not knowing which way to turn, not knowing where you were headed. You were not happy. There were so many choices that all you could see was no way to be happy.\nYou were a child. A child, a person who is blind isn\u2019t responsible. You did nothing wrong. You were in an environment where you could be harmed, you could be abused, you could be hurt. There were so many choices. There were so many decisions. And it\u2019s only through the grace of God that you made the right choices. And one choice was to be born again.","token_len":646,"entropy":[6.9476,0.4318,1.4643,3.3747,0.5086,5.3756,1.551,6.5892,6.3265,1.0729,1.3311,3.1866,3.5477,1.0055,4.9577,3.763,2.5462,0.2203,1.0092,5.5675,1.524,0.8971,2.0819,5.131,0.0208,1.0238,1.3767,2.484,6.7608,1.497,4.8263,7.7838,5.704,3.7165,0.6633,1.7671,3.9877,2.9662,3.4675,2.9837,0.1823,2.5249,0.4719,0.8817,2.2321,16.653,9.1161,4.5376,3.5882,1.7674,4.4818,0.9642,1.8509,2.6941,1.6014,1.8308,0.1823,8.3468,2.9741,12.2792,3.0467,7.6559,1.5567,0.656,2.3951,0.4011,5.5091,0.6232,3.1261,5.9112,4.4239,0.7511,5.3743,1.7255,6.6016,1.1634,2.8369,1.6489,8.3272,2.9232,0.0009,1.4207,7.5957,1.5225,7.0339,5.7889,6.6448,6.5634,6.8603,3.3934,6.3915,0.4621,1.7265,6.1183,2.4361,2.3365,1.6843,5.9065,1.124,4.7655,0.2913,3.314,4.377,1.2619,3.6065,5.4665,5.6191,0.5587,2.067,1.2227,2.1933,4.8934,3.6252,5.2301,0.4927,7.5237,1.0824,5.3893,0.6831,6.568,1.4366,4.4639,3.5694,0.9495,3.0313,1.6881,5.3559,5.6658,4.8803,0.2728,2.5831,3.6069,1.2514,1.2407,4.5115,0.6948,0.5721,3.9041,2.084,2.8281,2.9771,7.2333,4.2651,5.0125,7.8259,5.2215,4.4864,0.8199,4.4794,1.3225,6.5761,1.0406,2.2125,4.4248,5.5942,5.1905,1.5797,5.2903,5.818,1.8166,2.5014,4.5873,2.2761,4.1048,0.0021,3.9506,2.2883,1.5233,2.1033,7.2857,3.5093,0.7885,0.9914,1.8324,4.0309,3.273,8.3807,3.2451,1.9077,4.2953,2.5393,4.2528,4.0939,3.5656,0.3088,5.3237,3.6077,2.8362,0.4158,0.3845,1.3112,2.6402,0.7782,3.6837,0.4499,1.8901,1.8644,1.3917,0.6137,0.5785,0.4099,3.477,3.6127,1.202,4.7197,4.3874,4.709,1.4848,2.6567,2.6917,4.6554,1.699,1.2667,1.0746,0.0026,0.1731,1.6718,0.2306,6.427,3.8591,2.3949,3.6746,2.6389,2.0508,1.3271,0.0026,0.1894,3.3946,1.5356,1.246,1.4401,2.8471,0.5759,1.0211,4.0789,1.802,5.7801,2.7663,4.1131,4.1769,3.7092,1.7747,5.6351,1.5897,5.8099,3.4328,0.889,5.4043,0.908,3.1103,2.6115,2.4242,3.9845,2.0272,3.1866,6.2433,0.9581,1.2715,3.4152,0.3591,4.1846,0.9604,3.1559,2.9963,0.0013,5.2763,4.136,1.2055,3.9072,6.1828,0.926,6.4994,0.6455,0.8428,1.2351,1.0668,2.7332,2.0072,1.6299,3.3167,0.0655,0.3135,0.1067,3.5953,6.2995,1.0524,7.0041,0.8618,2.565,0.5776,1.4839,0.6442,2.2819,0.1901,0.9119,0.2049,5.9291,3.1747,0.5483,1.0825,0.1358,5.285,3.0417,2.1001,0.925,2.4595,0.2879,1.0366,3.5709,5.1923,1.1655,0.8841,4.1425,3.0985,1.4941,7.1266,1.907,3.1235,2.4571,0.694,2.1481,0.5593,1.031,4.8895,5.03,4.1089,0.8507,0.1871,0.0068,3.3883,4.472,3.5348,0.2931,1.8293,5.5124,4.6237,1.7187,1.2344,0.042,4.9736,1.1775,3.7135,2.2338,0.6475,0.4217,1.4648,3.4524,2.4538,3.3631,2.6303,5.5796,1.3566,2.469,0.0547,0.1456,0.6665,0.519,0.5071,1.7259,0.6705,0.1238,0.2794,0.8194,0.3647,2.7106,5.4121,7.8709,1.4623,2.3134,4.9044,5.5119,1.8585,8.2757,0.2575,0.8222,0.5089,0.1393,0.2141,8.2768,1.555,3.7074,0.7919,3.5429,2.6853,1.9909,0.287,0.0527,0.2419,2.5404,2.1801,3.5938,3.0275,0.8253,0.0895,0.2874,1.0447,3.8183,6.3275,2.0161,1.3582,3.855,5.058,6.13,0.2189,4.08,2.3153,5.2203,0.7743,2.9385,3.5297,8.041,0.4333,1.3528,3.6414,1.4349,4.2526,1.0677,0.4914,0.0751,1.3765,4.5516,4.3563,6.0631,3.572,0.3658,0.8385,0.8224,3.871,1.2369,2.939,0.0397,1.5422,3.3767,0.5033,5.7171,0.1662,1.8962,2.0422,0.5908,5.0187,2.23,5.085,0.7171,3.821,2.9566,0.3444,0.0243,0.029,2.9511,0.7574,0.0576,5.0282,5.6875,0.0023,3.8443,2.5641,7.1323,0.4225,1.0372,2.1783,0.6404,0.7054,0.7982,0.8848,0.1515,0.0204,0.003,0.0776,0.1281,0.0148,5.65,3.3886,0.47,1.2718,5.7586,3.957,3.9085,6.5991,2.8963,0.3938,1.2661,0.114,0.6919,2.187,2.8944,5.9933,5.3057,1.8417,0.9585,5.3815,0.9801,9.277,1.1549,0.8013,2.0258,5.3723,1.1957,3.7879,0.755,2.9297,5.1034,5.0852,5.1565,5.7903,1.6091,1.0926,0.8884,1.4048,2.4869,4.1121,5.2456,0.5054,0.5408,1.5675,1.3869,3.4398,2.1656,2.2553,4.7752,1.1831,1.0322,1.0534,0.1428,2.5837,1.4227,0.3402,5.1129,1.4184,0.2992,2.4594,1.2768,1.008,0.1265,2.0534,2.1951,0.9896,3.3799,0.7153,0.9949,0.6326,3.8636,4.388,1.0916,4.3855,1.6319,1.4622,0.017,5.1142,2.2991,5.5791,0.7991,1.3556,4.5355,0.9212,6.7578,2.2823,0.8083,2.6928,0.0825,0.3136,1.1266,1.5355,0.9006,3.4543,2.6035,2.1562,4.2127,1.1681,4.0471,1.5892,5.3887,2.1285,4.361,3.3569,9.6002,0.4193,0.3288,0.0366,6.4341,3.3327,1.5993,5.3835,3.7614,0.3447,0.4547,0.4524,1.4274,4.1379,4.6789,2.8691,1.0008,1.0817,2.1182,2.5074,7.6941,2.1041,3.4658,1.3405,0.4255,4.6417,0.7367,0.38,0.2785,0.471,3.4907,0.8099,3.4884,0.8773,0.3778,0.0117,0.7627,1.9602,2.4126,0.3629,0.454,0.037,5.6246,2.1999,2.6783,3.0728,2.14,0.0125,0.1716,5.4477,2.9805,2.1171,2.1564,0.1888,0.161,0.4378,0.3106,3.9097,2.3754,1.5619,0.4706,0.5358,3.0693,6.1705,4.4673,2.7546,3.3757,2.1583,3.361,2.2119,0.7674]}

You are the soul that has been punished with the longest sentence in the history of Mankind. And survived. Tell your story. If you live, you are free of your debt.\nDoris Day, born Doris Evelyn Gassett on 7 July 1924 was an American singer, actress, songwriter, and Broadway actress, and a multi Grammy Award winning recording artist. There are a lot of songs she has recorded about loneliness and a lot of questions I have for you on some of these songs. Many of these songs are considered classics like : \u201d What\u2019s New Pussycat?.\u201d\nI will begin with \u201cWhat\u2019s New Pussycat\u201d. At first this song seems to be all about sex. But actually it is much more.\nPussycat : \u201cYou know, that\u2019s just too rough, that\u2019s not fair, and then you won\u2019t get me.\u201d Cat : ( to pussycat ) Well, maybe I won\u2019t get you. Pussy : Well, maybe I won\u2019t get you. I am the king of the jungle, I am the king of the jungle, I am the king of the jungle, and you are just a little kitten. ( music ) This is the way I want it \u2026 ( music )\nI know what you mean. Loneliness is a terrible way to live without love. It is like living in a prison. I know. It is like being alone. Even the best of friends is not a friendship long enough. Many men are only satisfied being in a friendship or romantic association with another woman.\nI have many great friends. Some I still see. But few live together any longer. They either married, divorced, or are unmarried. I am happy that I got to know many nice people. I even dated and had relationships with one single woman for six and a half years. She left me and I didn\u2019t like it. She was only 18 at the time. She married a friend from school. I miss her. But I guess she thought I was in prison. She was so young. It was the first year of college and I was eighteen. And I wouldn\u2019t be lonely if she would have stayed. I still miss her, but she did me no good. If only I had the love of a true friend. Maybe I would just fall asleep.\nAnd yes, all people should be friends. And if not, get a friend. I don\u2019t think love will make it. It\u2019s all in the mind. Love is a special relationship between a man and a woman. It is not a requirement. You don\u2019t need love to be happy. Love will fill a deep hole in your heart. But you do need a friend. But this comes after love is gone from your heart. And I think you will know what is right for you when love has passed you by.","token_len":646,"entropy":[2.8744,1.2771,10.989,2.8976,6.2905,0.3846,5.4527,1.6667,3.6098,0.4166,0.9801,1.8249,5.0935,0.9476,4.7037,0.0081,3.2536,5.5436,2.3881,0.6848,0.1499,0.7027,5.6083,3.1268,0.3433,6.0941,5.6014,6.2072,1.7695,4.3483,5.9914,2.0841,0.6555,3.424,1.194,3.8326,6.3829,2.7932,2.945,0.9045,5.6173,4.1541,1.7404,8.4557,1.7284,2.2209,0.8852,1.5846,0.0025,6.718,0.431,3.5344,12.7029,2.8034,8.0684,2.2633,1.7209,1.4491,4.116,0.3472,4.813,1.6254,1.5329,1.8823,4.6981,3.6678,4.0844,6.3413,1.437,2.6617,11.0772,7.1588,7.1601,2.712,6.3831,6.5327,0.8842,6.147,2.2314,6.6873,5.6747,2.3072,3.7442,5.7587,2.7812,5.4302,4.5361,2.7509,1.4722,3.6201,1.1624,3.0578,0.7719,3.4929,0.0525,0.554,1.2705,7.6249,2.3455,2.2022,2.9154,2.1731,6.5911,4.2177,1.1008,1.3412,5.8303,0.1202,0.3933,7.1386,1.3046,3.6657,2.5174,0.0456,3.7088,3.3509,1.4733,3.8555,4.7135,7.4716,1.0791,4.9892,4.1218,0.1245,6.6488,6.3975,1.3811,3.152,0.5165,4.0718,5.8112,0.1283,1.7018,1.7864,0.5435,5.0084,0.3831,1.334,0.9457,0.9262,6.1183,2.4456,6.9297,9.9923,9.8133,9.4227,6.2555,11.2532,9.9106,3.4271,7.8585,8.4026,3.027,6.2153,2.4424,7.217,3.2536,1.9198,3.0074,3.5988,4.1108,3.8788,0.6983,4.6694,5.1522,4.4656,0.5851,0.3599,0.0404,0.4665,0.112,0.0003,0.0023,2.173,0.8777,1.5155,6.38,1.9071,4.4594,0.9213,3.3694,1.1445,0.7129,4.7989,0.6519,5.4985,1.1346,2.3078,5.8122,1.4388,0.7396,4.4819,0.2325,2.7851,4.06,4.8628,0.4749,0.122,6.1544,1.5652,2.8923,4.583,3.0981,1.0287,3.6402,2.3174,0.7683,1.8594,3.8872,4.847,6.4274,2.835,4.014,0.5035,0.0443,0.3682,3.3988,5.0823,1.5162,2.8831,4.3507,1.5738,6.9993,1.5774,0.7291,1.3601,2.2737,6.3615,3.3677,2.2309,0.5879,10.5576,1.8009,5.1916,7.5709,8.0895,0.0429,0.5559,3.6621,0.4533,4.2369,1.9407,3.2764,1.0598,0.039,0.1424,0.5364,0.2415,0.9921,5.7913,0.0149,6.7349,3.5959,0.2733,0.5349,0.3588,0.3563,0.0675,0.0054,0.0153,0.0581,0.0275,0.2328,3.126,3.5268,3.5648,5.1351,0.469,1.5002,5.5399,1.4026,2.9954,1.3801,0.6103,1.2489,0.0959,0.834,1.4844,1.173,1.2424,0.4902,0.1706,0.2708,0.0128,0.1484,0.223,0.9683,1.3791,2.5655,1.089,4.1485,2.7065,2.4248,6.5783,1.0629,3.5556,8.0816,0.4681,4.8504,0.9769,2.1319,4.0552,1.4066,2.4174,1.9575,7.5108,2.758,3.4951,0.0337,2.4232,2.61,3.7934,2.509,0.9207,1.4149,0.8094,7.3767,1.5106,0.7905,1.6731,3.897,4.965,0.2601,0.5421,7.704,2.7334,0.4384,2.0034,0.9203,3.7031,4.2811,0.7098,0.6036,3.2594,0.946,2.4656,2.2497,3.3142,2.45,0.6832,1.6612,2.5079,4.801,1.0704,5.7536,2.9119,2.4127,1.0705,4.0575,6.8475,3.0582,2.3595,7.7096,7.7777,0.8339,1.7123,6.6427,4.9094,2.1808,5.3255,7.0884,6.4248,2.3806,1.3435,7.0097,4.6171,6.4297,7.611,1.0205,3.7495,5.0041,0.4724,2.5895,2.2906,2.9576,4.3033,5.1348,1.0252,1.323,2.8898,3.5226,5.4236,4.5258,1.7733,3.263,4.9205,5.9702,4.7089,4.9828,0.2395,0.4266,2.7135,5.7413,7.6108,2.2596,1.1889,0.2346,0.5718,3.1302,7.1663,0.2094,2.032,2.1598,4.0541,2.7507,0.9032,5.3588,1.7611,2.5341,2.3936,5.2668,0.7838,1.1252,1.3886,5.3961,6.3264,5.499,1.5542,5.3975,0.2146,5.8331,6.8682,1.2146,3.8769,4.7341,5.652,0.3465,0.0036,0.0667,0.359,3.729,4.939,0.5488,2.6942,0.9593,3.9729,2.8671,0.5582,0.0325,3.4803,0.8996,0.5271,2.4704,1.7802,4.8801,4.5658,3.2066,0.0479,0.0078,0.6642,1.9995,5.4413,2.4753,4.7502,4.448,2.6482,1.3316,1.6018,6.7893,0.1887,1.5286,3.3324,1.0376,5.3256,1.9662,5.3226,0.8488,0.3882,5.3675,6.806,0.9472,2.3122,1.604,3.3327,3.1353,1.3507,3.7158,0.8778,3.662,2.242,4.9184,1.1711,2.1903,2.1646,1.2144,0.9567,5.9828,0.7356,3.3409,1.5465,6.8757,0.3071,0.2751,0.0047,2.9252,7.4555,2.3711,3.0329,4.5531,0.931,2.1841,1.5958,1.4591,5.2208,2.4072,0.0682,2.6493,0.9478,1.7629,4.6813,5.694,2.783,0.6606,0.3477,5.4567,4.0404,0.7263,1.0998,4.6373,3.8187,0.7957,2.2315,4.9974,2.2665,0.7103,4.5965,0.8396,0.5478,5.746,5.3093,3.7728,2.2928,1.3158,4.0318,5.7826,0.2315,5.7344,5.8959,3.8068,1.5252,5.0674,0.7432,3.4867,3.2741,3.9979,0.389,6.9098,2.7918,3.4101,0.7653,2.0915,2.5182,0.4901,0.1356,0.0056,2.1256,6.82,4.2551,3.1235,3.8849,2.0385,2.5972,4.5462,0.0919,0.1854,3.212,4.3992,0.6105,3.1296,0.6036,3.7367,0.6768,2.0489,6.6503,4.0106,3.3161,2.1161,1.2572,0.0532,0.3468,0.0304,0.3593,1.5337,0.6558,2.3036,1.4192,8.7532,2.5458,3.4239,2.7231,0.163,0.2887,0.0034,1.5447,2.9068,1.0094,1.6087,2.016,0.3843,2.0049,3.4613,5.9366,3.0383,6.7728,0.5149,0.4712,0.5376,0.5834,0.4826,4.0507,2.3115,2.4274,0.8178,2.2374,0.9153,0.6144,5.452,4.742,6.7725,4.7528,5.9647,2.0252,4.9469,4.1771,0.9754,1.404,0.2065,2.7437,2.5995,2.2634,2.1303,2.5772,4.1499,2.583,3.7212,3.2692,1.5712,0.1853,1.7562,5.7604,3.1356,5.0729,4.2255,0.9704,0.1646]}
{"prompt":"An NPC encounters a hero embarking on destined adventure , gets jealous , and decides he wants to fulfill that destiny instead .","text":"An NPC encounters a hero embarking on destined adventure, gets jealous, and decides he wants to fulfill that destiny instead. So, he sacrifices his own destiny, and becomes a monster. Not only does such a thing make for a memorable character with a cool ending, he is a hero.\nOn the other hand, if he's a monster, the audience knows it from the beginning, so the ending can be boring and forgettable.\nI don't know which option you have decided, it would be nice for a final answer.\nIs this a normal answer? I feel like it's a bit longer than the other answer, but I can't post more than 50 bytes.\nAs a final point, I have to mention that this is actually very important to keep the characters in the story, and help readers understand their motivations better.\n\nA:\n\nWe can't even begin to go into a conversation about this, as your choices really speak to different things at different points of a story.\nIn the short answer, you need to consider what impact these differences will have on the overall tone and flow of the story.\n\nIf you're writing a new plot, and a new character, this is a perfect choice, as you can build whatever backstory and motivations the character has to fit exactly when they need to and do so with as little inconsistencies as possible at the same time, as the reader will notice as soon as these characters are not part the same story thread as the others.\nMost of the time I prefer this one for the characters who are part of the main story line. We all know the plot, so we need to consider more aspects about the character like who they really are. If we're going to have them kill someone they are closer to, we need to have their motivations for doing it well understood by the readers.\nThe latter option is used, for instance, in the movie Shutter Island when the main character, Danny Torrance, has his entire life flash across his mind before he is taken away from the family. Not only we learn their whole backround, we also get clues to their motives for being a killer during those flashbacks as well. It gives the audience clues as to how things are going to end and the author can even hint at the big reveal.\n\nA:\n\nI think what you're looking for is characterization, whether it is real or not is really up to the author, in my opinion, you have to be realistic.  Personally, I prefer to have a character who is an archetype (i.e. the jerk, the angel, the hero, the psychopath, etc.), but it depends.  A character can be real, but only when they have real qualities and flaws.  If the heroine is a monster, it can be true, but what makes her monster is the way she was raised.\nThe best approach is to have realistic descriptions of the different personalities.  Give the reader clues to what your character is thinking.  If they are talking about that, then they aren't a mind reader.

{"prompt":"A computer chip implanted in your brain has been influencing your decisions .","text":"A computer chip implanted in your brain has been influencing your decisions. It\u2019s also given the company control over the life of its employee. The company has told all its employees that if at any time they feel uncomfortable or unhappy, they should leave the job immediately. In the event of a \u201cwrong\u201d decision by the brain implant to terminate an employee, no trial, appeals or grievances are available. It is the world\u2019s most advanced brain implant. It\u2019s not a mind-control device, but it\u2019s the most advanced version of today\u2019s most well known, most widely and feared implant, mind-controlled weapons.\nA small microchip inside the brain could end up being used to manipulate other people\u2019s actions, not just in the workplace, but also in politics and perhaps even to change public opinion.\nWhen most people think about mind-controlled weapons, they think of the Soviet Union. They think of the films of science fiction.\nBut if brain implants were able to tap someone\u2019s thoughts, do they not also imply the possibility of direct communications? Wouldn\u2019t the implants give an employee a key to their boss\u2019s office so that they could easily manipulate the boss\u2019s mind?\nThink about this: If any of the employees in a company\u2019s office was able to communicate directly with their bosses and to request the boss to end all their work, why would the boss do exactly that? Isn\u2019t this what brain implants really seek to achieve. They give someone in the company the ability to simply stop the action at their will. And if the company doesn\u2019t do anything, it is also giving its own boss the power to keep working. A company whose employees are controlled by their minds is, at its very core, already a dictatorship. A company whose employees work in the same direction as their bosses is a tyranny.\nBrain implants provide the most advanced system for controlling individuals and groups. In the workplace, many employees have an absolute right to resign from their jobs. Their boss should be able to call them and tell them to stop working. How would you know if they had done this? You wouldn\u2019t be able to, because that would result in the employee having to quit anyway. But what if the boss didn\u2019t try to terminate the employee? What if the boss just asked the employee to stop working and let go? The company simply wouldn\u2019t know it and the employee wouldn\u2019t be able to prove it, but he really should stop working.\nBrain implants would allow a boss to fire someone without any form of appeal or appeal. Someone with a brain implant would stop working, and the boss would simply say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d In most cases, of course, brain implants would not stop work immediately, but would gradually wear out. But in the event that your boss was an ambitious individual who knew the ultimate goal was to eliminate certain employee\u2019s abilities, that individual might simply be too busy killing the individual for them to notice that the implant had worn out.","token_len":649,"entropy":[9.3107,6.0613,6.2113,0.5161,2.3648,2.4573,3.5289,1.45,10.5268,1.1202,4.6113,2.0495,2.5109,18.2455,7.908,2.3737,4.7341,6.9834,4.0783,7.1163,4.9894,0.3373,1.8317,6.4234,0.9365,3.0255,5.9898,0.8467,3.0175,1.4003,1.6678,4.7212,5.0471,2.2888,0.3226,0.8644,2.7855,7.9732,0.8877,0.5937,1.0322,3.2324,3.0966,2.203,4.4,1.4772,0.4651,1.8639,2.4835,1.2992,2.9241,2.3254,0.402,3.8803,2.2885,4.7172,1.0556,1.291,14.289,5.9595,9.2276,0.3083,8.0215,2.5438,3.6104,1.5792,8.0085,3.8778,6.2233,2.2383,3.3099,0.0576,0.6039,5.8194,9.8161,3.5418,5.8106,0.8273,8.5434,2.664,3.7789,0.7482,4.1628,1.2691,2.9542,8.4942,1.2737,0.2248,0.0744,3.4396,4.6505,4.2803,0.2635,1.4068,2.5998,1.7215,0.0326,0.0212,3.3165,2.4204,6.5055,1.427,0.994,0.4346,1.3491,0.8291,1.9818,0.6561,0.0229,0.0094,2.9274,1.4564,0.8524,4.6482,0.2823,8.3067,0.9661,0.0622,1.1262,3.664,6.2994,1.8769,3.0183,1.6942,2.6079,7.2926,7.9298,2.6687,2.8871,7.9283,0.9871,2.0224,6.1199,0.7901,1.778,8.1653,5.4569,7.8559,0.3204,4.7817,1.2027,1.5883,5.8551,7.4385,1.5068,2.6083,0.7222,0.5323,3.897,4.4615,0.8089,0.2657,0.0441,0.133,3.3535,1.7692,5.1656,0.7296,4.096,1.4999,1.1134,1.4541,0.2589,1.505,0.5319,5.5032,1.6262,6.4436,0.3425,4.7426,4.1943,4.5225,0.4757,0.7482,1.4266,4.9491,6.4231,0.5606,1.0439,1.0492,4.7113,0.4975,1.6682,0.4097,0.3816,0.5986,0.4614,0.4514,1.9046,4.2555,0.2327,1.4324,2.6597,0.2859,0.3177,1.1381,10.2234,2.177,8.6979,0.1329,2.5069,3.8365,2.8065,3.9468,5.1599,0.5344,1.9475,4.7138,0.0032,7.4152,7.5865,0.8521,0.0135,0.0805,3.146,1.0691,6.8765,0.6986,3.1527,3.3593,9.4144,2.425,2.0216,0.3387,6.8202,7.5965,2.5177,6.4456,0.4146,0.23,1.2714,2.3042,4.3299,4.2476,3.6304,2.4316,2.133,6.5795,0.3598,1.6624,5.9159,0.7792,0.0064,0.2326,1.8325,5.6278,1.2267,1.1001,0.4913,4.5471,4.18,2.2573,2.6486,0.2914,0.0027,0.023,1.9944,0.9229,0.7907,4.6904,0.6609,2.2172,1.5437,2.5836,5.4718,2.0877,1.3167,2.2047,2.3462,1.3834,2.156,5.3298,0.01,0.0963,0.9652,4.3204,2.7719,0.01,3.7044,2.8984,0.358,1.6505,3.7221,3.566,3.6405,7.6408,3.0284,3.409,2.3642,5.7821,4.1699,3.5443,1.5453,0.6614,3.4465,1.0426,1.9304,3.3259,3.6063,7.4889,0.35,0.2681,5.5628,0.1129,0.0303,0.0037,2.3418,2.51,5.0457,0.3,5.5426,6.055,0.8854,2.235,5.8884,2.9905,6.0672,4.7891,3.3158,1.0462,1.5114,1.2039,0.7087,0.0241,6.9779,4.7783,3.2168,6.0095,3.6709,3.6471,3.2253,1.3895,3.7433,1.7736,1.7794,2.5457,3.0638,0.6008,0.0202,0.2053,3.5456,3.2291,1.5159,2.5965,2.1123,5.1936,5.5818,4.7157,5.0076,4.9796,0.6152,1.7198,0.1011,5.2156,3.8865,0.9678,5.3935,2.5154,5.0858,0.8957,1.233,6.0653,0.2473,2.7561,3.9178,2.0696,3.9797,2.8927,2.2828,1.78,0.6884,0.0309,8.0326,1.0817,4.7468,0.3304,3.8501,1.4593,0.4619,0.2181,5.5989,1.9927,1.9069,2.6561,5.4643,0.8353,1.2538,0.8622,1.0434,1.6314,5.2749,0.3039,0.5749,4.3834,0.2396,4.9169,1.8434,2.9935,2.0956,5.6454,1.8128,1.5965,3.9037,2.1699,2.6509,1.2448,3.7317,1.6337,4.5294,0.2183,5.452,1.1963,2.2486,3.9718,4.9478,1.3834,0.098,9.1929,2.323,0.9157,0.3675,1.5978,4.6464,3.5016,4.9827,1.9508,0.6858,0.0185,5.2374,1.29,2.7175,1.5528,0.0525,1.0192,2.2086,1.2088,0.6662,5.9101,3.1522,3.5853,2.7168,1.1665,2.7435,2.7727,3.5134,1.8272,0.3884,4.3476,2.8949,0.1561,0.0448,0.0054,2.1621,0.6427,0.0214,4.0797,1.3906,4.0994,0.4406,5.4824,0.0073,1.7682,2.3346,3.8003,0.6409,3.7829,7.2352,0.312,3.3379,3.2988,0.6057,1.4939,2.6918,2.881,0.154,0.0234,0.3367,6.3759,0.7221,4.34,1.4345,0.2669,1.5421,1.8811,0.2377,1.0382,2.412,3.6248,4.4296,1.3531,0.3618,0.2292,2.2169,0.3157,2.1694,3.8689,3.8475,1.3412,3.1193,3.6966,6.7108,2.1909,0.0617,0.049,0.0094,4.0231,5.1224,3.8783,2.7845,0.3503,1.7889,0.037,0.0116,0.5862,1.2842,0.5128,0.0039,6.3845,0.6681,3.5498,3.7399,4.8011,7.8759,2.5619,5.7114,0.5569,0.503,0.7518,2.6482,0.136,4.1615,2.5526,2.3587,5.1344,0.1871,6.2745,3.4855,2.449,2.4906,7.0757,0.0031,5.8355,1.5693,3.5404,4.5226,5.8707,2.8831,1.0826,2.6671,0.2668,1.2689,5.1201,1.1633,2.488,1.788,1.5991,1.8595,0.3235,3.695,3.8412,1.0687,8.501,3.5257,1.7734,2.6002,0.4034,0.6823,0.8944,1.3047,3.4147,3.0108,0.7227,0.0974,0.0246,1.3261,1.1523,1.3391,0.3588,7.377,8.2046,4.1211,4.4286,0.8499,0.213,5.8145,0.1045,0.1005,4.559,0.0984,1.5373,1.8987,2.5771,2.6914,6.9896,1.3684,0.6261,3.2226,5.0884,7.0826,2.5692,2.0002,3.6843,2.6315,1.361,3.4075,1.3104,5.507,1.5162,3.4189,6.4509,8.2704,3.1052,1.4253,5.1652,2.6859,5.6408,1.3394,4.0715,0.3178,4.0056,6.4281,6.9835,6.2715,0.0532,0.0142,4.413,0.53,3.9642,4.2904,2.7842,4.0497,2.6714,6.2297,3.1873,6.646,3.0914,4.8396,2.9476,3.892,0.4453,3.3456,2.5004,1.8276,2.9411,2.0508,3.9244,0.4832,0.4365]}
{"prompt":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story , Leave A Comment - Murderous Intent Edition","text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Murderous Intent Edition -\n\u201cYou can tell a girl is hiding something if she can talk about her body. A good deal of people who think it\u2019s fine to keep a secret have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\u201cFor the love of God, tell them you\u2019re just fine and you need to get out there and do something about all this. Don\u2019t live your life wondering what\u2019s wrong and what you should be doing.\u201d\nI\u2019ll admit to being a bit late to the party here. This book has been on my radar since the first edition was published in 2012, and it\u2019s an interesting, fast-paced book that really grabs the reader. I\u2019ve had mixed feelings about it so far; it\u2019s a good read, but I won\u2019t call it a favourite.\nWe start the tale with the death of a young girl who had been recently orphaned. The case of the girl\u2019s death has never quite cleared up, as her body had never been laid to rest. We soon learn that at the time she died, three of the girl\u2019s best friends were also in grave danger and that both of the murdered girls had their wrists ripped out and their head bitten off.\nIt will come as no surprise to find out that none of their attackers were ever prosecuted, which leaves us with a case to resolve that has been going on since the teenagers were discovered.\nAs the story unfolds, we have the point of view of three teenagers: Rachel (or \u201cRac\u201d as we will refer to her), a 16-year-old girl living in a small village, and Chloe (or \u201cCo\u201d) who was 17 years old at the time. It\u2019s been nearly three years since their friend Liz had been killed but we only have a vague idea of what happened to her and her body wasn\u2019t found until much later.\nIt\u2019s clear that Rac and Co have been trying to bury the memories associated with Liz and her fate, but then one day Rac sees something in Rac\u2019s town that has her questioning everything she knew about it and the way she looked at herself.\n\u201cThe most terrifying thing is you are not the worst example of yourself in the world. That\u2019s what Liz thought, too. Not that she had it easy, of course. She took great care of people. She liked people. She had an incredible sense of humour and, when she saw the world, she took it all in without looking for someone to point out flaws in it.\u201dp.7\nI don\u2019t think we ever get the true story for Liz and her friends, and as the reader I found myself questioning the accuracy of Rac\u2019s statements and her own understanding of the past. If we know the story, how could I not have known it before I read this book?

{"prompt":"Cupid went overboard last valentines day . 9 months later the stork is being overworked and decides to call Cupid to see what happened","text":"Cupid went overboard last valentines day. 9 months later the stork is being overworked and decides to call Cupid to see what happened with the baby. Cupid, however, has no idea where the baby is (she\u2019s a busy lady this morning!) and says he thought they said there\u2019s an emergency and that we\u2019ll just have to reschedule to a later date. The Storks, meanwhile, is going crazy because the baby has already been through so much stuffing, changing diapers, nursing, and now all she wants is a few snuggles from her mommy. The Storks finally decides to go find her and then, once the baby finds her, they spend the rest of the day bonding. It\u2019s a sweet and light-hearted movie and makes you feel good about Valentine\u2019s Day.\nAnother cute animated movie for kids and for adults alike. It\u2019s a very short movie but is a little like a sitcom with all the elements you\u2019d expect (drama, adventure, comedy). I actually enjoyed this movie more than Little Shop of Horrors. There\u2019s an explanation of the \u201cjellyfish\u201d that they use as the back-up character because many people are really confused about why there\u2019s a jellyfish named after a human being and thought it was silly. You may see the scene where they put a jellyfish in the freezer and pretend to drown it and then the jellyfish turns out to be a robot and it\u2019s in a state of hibernation.\nWith so many movies being made, how can you find a movie you like or even a movie you may prefer to read? I\u2019m glad you can tell me what makes certain movies feel good because I want to know what makes a movie feel so good. Maybe I\u2019ll have my family rent some movies from you. Thanks a lot!\nI just want to thank you for the list you provided, you are right, it was so fun and educational. It makes us know the movie characters. Thanks for sharing your review, I will definitely watch this movies soon.\nIt was a very long list but I still really enjoyed it. Maybe there were too many so that means I can never go to a movie with my family again \ud83d\ude26\nThanks so much for the information, especially about Little Shop of Horrors. I haven\u2019t seen it in a long time, yet I\u2019m intrigued.\nI love to watch movies with my family and friends and I think of the movies that you recommended above, I think it will be really nice watching with my family.

{"prompt":"... So , how the hell do we get out of this alive ?","text":"... So, how the hell do we get out of this alive?!?\nYeah, that happened. I got a response to my comment about the lack of information on this article and here I am with a comment to that post.\nWhat this is shows is the need to make a connection to your reader. Make it personal. Make a point to connect. It works.\nThere are some good points raised. I'm only going to comment about one of them. The importance of getting links to your blog.\nI would say that, but what kind of links? It's not like someone is going through your blog and going to your main site and linking from there because that isn't how link farms work and it would do very little if any good for you. So, make the links to your blogs, but only links back to those pages on your blog that's going to get you your visitors and the links from the main site are going to be the ones that are doing the actual linking.\nWhat I was trying to say is that I don't think it would work at all to use a link farm to try to make links back to your blog. The reason for this is the way link farms work. The links to the main site are the ones that are working the best, because the linking from there does do something to the main site to increase its rank and if the link farm is to a page on the main site that is not relevant or not going to bring in a visitor, than it would have no effect whatsoever.\nBut then, that also depends on the link farm as well. How much linking is there on the main site, if it just has one article with one link on it, it would hardly have any effect because the main site is the most important thing, even more important than the link farm.\nThe reason I picked this example is because I think, even if there was a great way to make links on a link farm to a page on your blog to make your blog more relevant, I don't think it would work, because there is no great way to just bring a lot of people to a page on a blog that is already ranking well. You could always create a page or articles on your blog that ranked low that were relevant or something, the only problem with this is that it would be just a waste of time for sure. You then need pages on your blog that you are trying to increase the rank of to link to since they're not ranking as well as you would like them to, and there is nothing about linking to pages with low rank that that would help you do that either. I just think all this has to do with your main topic first, and the more relevant it is to that topic, the more important it is, and the more important its topic is, the better it would be to link back to that content and not the main page or something like that.\nThat is a good point and one I'm going to add to my answer. I think it is important to get links to any new posts on the blog and any pages that are going over the top of the traffic for the blog. Not so much pages that are below the traffic though.","token_len":653,"entropy":[7.7711,1.8594,3.3951,5.9629,0.7491,1.6149,1.9054,1.7708,3.2979,0.2941,0.9826,7.5762,3.8981,3.6751,1.3701,10.0667,0.3518,2.9965,6.6307,1.4069,1.9279,3.6691,2.3294,8.1944,3.0075,1.6863,5.7394,2.0766,2.1335,5.3367,0.0035,5.306,1.6649,2.5984,5.667,3.0603,5.2591,2.9189,0.2201,3.4089,1.7202,4.7654,3.9977,2.6006,4.7311,0.9639,1.7619,4.1246,4.6713,2.8773,7.0692,4.3663,2.6313,4.7006,0.9791,3.6082,2.309,5.8456,2.0938,5.1934,6.3393,1.4894,6.3525,2.0668,5.0405,0.9056,2.4586,3.0137,1.8515,1.2993,4.2708,2.2725,3.4874,5.6666,1.0391,1.5457,4.3819,1.0188,3.0229,3.8014,3.8609,7.3182,2.9136,1.9625,2.253,4.9797,2.127,0.0103,5.9828,3.2826,1.6279,1.8678,0.2097,0.8047,2.9618,6.8024,0.1071,4.5742,6.719,1.2154,1.3875,4.5223,3.0526,1.8229,2.161,4.4163,2.9595,1.4986,4.3858,5.2728,4.2717,5.5979,0.0062,1.5921,2.8267,3.7779,0.7695,1.5717,2.2656,5.1598,2.3952,1.0044,6.273,2.162,1.4731,1.3216,3.9595,0.9377,4.7584,5.7423,1.4121,1.2546,5.1337,6.0858,0.8554,5.5728,2.4798,5.472,0.0002,2.7941,6.3135,8.0662,0.1466,3.8576,2.0666,4.2323,5.9851,4.6598,0.3967,3.7958,3.7626,1.9252,2.8691,1.2134,0.4883,3.8003,0.6795,5.1736,2.8707,2.9813,2.3586,0.318,3.7684,4.114,3.0081,3.4873,4.1394,5.3024,0.1701,3.6163,3.7349,4.6507,0.4732,0.9557,2.3116,6.9838,3.0771,0.1273,2.3446,0.954,3.9061,5.9859,2.4931,3.9784,3.127,3.5813,3.4364,2.5376,0.5329,2.5673,1.2139,0.0559,1.3726,2.8752,1.5083,0.5381,2.352,5.6164,0.5851,2.6878,2.5717,0.6248,0.7217,3.4861,1.8181,4.9424,1.5702,0.0034,0.5888,0.6814,1.1106,3.3631,2.3119,0.0004,1.3343,2.3845,3.1142,2.3869,4.3726,0.1132,2.5502,4.6217,1.9481,1.6453,0.3488,1.7796,4.6913,1.2565,3.0349,2.357,3.7208,0.1607,0.513,0.8932,0.9508,3.2378,3.6289,2.7323,1.239,0.1786,3.6742,3.1919,2.0251,0.0644,0.1521,0.5096,2.7934,4.0142,2.2341,2.4153,0.3136,0.2817,0.9326,2.3432,0.6986,0.2989,1.1451,4.8524,2.6902,2.9486,2.71,3.649,2.2395,5.2746,3.0769,3.3757,4.4852,5.2043,4.5328,1.7289,1.3174,2.0156,0.0419,4.8867,5.6541,3.2867,6.0643,1.7249,5.6069,2.3784,0.7432,1.8733,1.3815,4.0945,4.3794,3.0044,2.7639,1.5835,0.1101,0.0276,1.9111,1.6668,2.8451,3.6776,4.082,3.4453,4.1398,0.2424,5.4386,1.9622,2.6335,2.6027,1.2752,8.4484,1.5699,2.3916,3.3944,1.9531,0.9016,2.1918,0.6407,0.7226,3.5056,3.8118,1.318,3.6391,4.4374,4.9176,0.1532,1.039,3.5327,0.3844,4.641,0.6521,0.4097,4.4332,2.5544,6.3183,1.7847,2.4246,2.6936,1.0638,0.1605,0.0242,2.7037,3.6355,1.3179,6.5328,3.5618,3.1666,6.538,4.8844,3.5358,0.8287,3.3734,0.5668,1.4203,2.8814,1.9007,6.9812,2.4846,0.8097,0.5102,4.7195,1.7434,1.7057,0.0475,1.432,2.4154,2.7902,1.6434,3.2975,3.1603,4.5036,4.1037,1.3935,0.5686,0.7621,1.3496,0.2558,0.4387,0.8729,2.8764,2.8563,2.0623,7.3486,0.9514,4.3883,0.9447,0.5684,1.3386,2.1143,4.223,3.8858,0.9161,3.2726,2.2335,1.0293,5.1346,4.9582,0.2616,1.9904,0.7235,3.8314,2.0468,1.0887,0.0363,2.5506,1.8358,0.8561,0.689,1.2637,1.0042,4.8108,2.4285,2.8809,2.9431,1.7568,0.6165,0.9972,2.8269,1.8951,0.0005,0.0941,1.121,0.1936,0.7157,3.9811,1.3166,3.0505,1.3186,1.1395,5.0937,0.2565,0.2332,6.6476,5.7504,2.8265,5.4149,0.0251,3.237,1.2951,2.5881,0.4854,1.196,1.7041,4.2523,2.0126,1.3049,4.433,5.5811,2.4058,1.2883,3.5361,2.9036,5.4767,3.9489,0.8011,3.3143,4.0145,7.7774,1.9228,1.1231,0.3864,0.8547,9.1865,5.523,4.3109,3.8604,3.8706,4.9007,4.4737,2.2451,5.6148,2.9565,3.2211,2.0315,2.086,0.6836,0.5042,1.7986,1.0156,1.9961,4.1567,1.6475,3.3204,0.1927,0.6117,3.1418,8.3636,0.6163,3.6529,6.6185,2.5143,8.2616,1.9006,0.6071,0.2256,0.466,2.8398,2.3966,3.5908,0.0199,4.6927,2.5147,2.1532,0.5821,4.0684,4.9727,0.4905,6.9634,2.1342,3.7506,1.6183,5.9627,3.4191,0.351,0.4728,2.0299,1.4313,0.8628,1.4211,0.0309,2.2039,1.7724,3.8319,1.0788,2.4716,4.1006,1.9019,0.8949,3.1529,4.7124,3.5947,2.0119,0.9444,6.2205,0.97,2.9859,1.0084,3.9158,0.5443,4.0118,0.1974,4.0701,4.0026,1.0616,6.4351,2.6908,3.9104,0.7724,1.5208,0.0167,2.9501,5.4594,6.9103,7.8029,1.6017,1.5964,3.1746,4.2791,3.4737,3.2863,0.3084,2.3939,3.4579,0.9671,0.5388,0.0703,1.1155,3.0576,0.2088,0.3225,4.2626,1.3788,0.7477,0.3903,1.8964,5.5317,5.8633,1.1806,1.8674,0.1864,1.3489,1.0153,3.1511,0.1986,1.2723,1.8058,3.5259,0.1242,1.6349,4.7848,2.8047,3.3115,3.697,1.3717,3.3087,3.4025,3.8867,2.2112,0.0305,0.2142,0.2947,3.5104,1.9712,2.9733,2.1619,0.2173,2.964,2.8862,1.3816,3.0748,1.4362,0.0192,3.1087,0.6477,1.9467,4.5685,1.0895,2.1906,1.231,2.0148,1.9157,1.9805,0.5783,3.4038,0.9605,0.62,5.4545,5.6131,2.7436,1.8751,2.5192,2.7888,2.7724,4.8466,4.8199,0.647,1.1721,2.6717,6.7225,1.7953,0.8524,1.6853,1.2153,8.5773,3.9908,1.7201,2.1532,1.1137,5.2709,5.6217,0.7706,6.0246,0.557,0.6177,6.7357,0.5099,2.3341,7.5396,0.897]}
{"prompt":"Writing Workshop # 36 - NaNo Prep # 1 : What will you write about ?","text":"Writing Workshop # 36 - NaNo Prep # 1 : What will you write about? - The Art of the Novel\nWith only 4.5 weeks until NaNoWriMo begins November 30, it\u2019s time to go out there and take stock of what you\u2019ve written and what you still need to accomplish. As you begin to formulate your next manuscript and to see what you can add to it, what have you learned about what you can and can\u2019t do well? What have you learned about what your characters want from you and what you can provide them? And at the end of the day, how many words did you put on paper on Saturday September 18?\nYour first job as a writer is to discover the very center of your character with the idea and the intention of writing a novel or creative nonfiction. And this isn\u2019t your first time through the learning curve. You\u2019ve been through the process many times before. As you enter that magical studio, you\u2019ve gone through the first lesson on stage where you need to figure out how to walk up the stairs (yes, literally) to your stage. You\u2019ve discovered that you can\u2019t hold a conversation or speak in a coherent way at the same time. You\u2019ve seen yourself in the mirror and learned there are certain places where the outline of your body doesn\u2019t match up with the outline of the stage.\nBut what else have you discovered? You\u2019ve seen yourself as the author and the writer and how different you are from other writers who appear on TV or read their words while they read. You\u2019ve seen yourself up the stage for many times, only to fall, only because you\u2019re trying to create a story that doesn\u2019t have a plot or a theme. You\u2019ve seen yourself in the mirror. Have you seen yourself as your reader? As a person who can read the emotions of your characters and see them as you see yourself? As an author, how many times have you gotten nervous that someone who seems to know what they\u2019re doing is going to try to tell you what you need to do?\nAll this being said, there\u2019s one more lesson to learn and it\u2019s learning that we create our own reality using our own belief system. It\u2019s time to go into the studio to write that thing (or things) because that\u2019s our thing (or things) that we need to write to create that thing (or things) that we desire the most in this life. If you love writing, then you will write that idea whether you like it or not. It\u2019s like the first time in theatre or film studies where you learn to jump up and turn and bend in a certain way. That\u2019s how we create our physical reality by putting that thing (or things) that we feel we need in life in front of us.\nThe first and most important thing to remember is that we can make our dream come true. And we can be whoever and whatever and do whatever we want to do in this wonderful life that we are given the opportunity to live.","token_len":654,"entropy":[12.2059,5.3264,9.2791,3.1315,10.0536,2.7439,23.2215,5.1243,3.3948,4.9317,5.5146,5.0357,1.6451,3.2744,2.8721,2.4408,4.1995,4.1568,6.0148,0.3985,3.8221,5.3897,2.4894,8.9145,5.9547,4.2761,4.9803,0.6304,3.5075,3.6384,6.317,0.0017,4.2625,0.4494,0.0083,5.4539,7.9102,3.8147,1.425,3.1414,17.5379,8.2451,1.6806,1.0363,0.4092,4.5808,3.441,2.6769,0.2172,3.9825,5.8779,0.2463,1.1573,0.7017,3.6068,0.7547,0.9913,2.2117,2.2481,1.0214,0.2291,6.5785,2.5,0.1305,5.8009,1.0172,4.3162,1.8876,3.9037,1.3532,5.3295,0.295,3.2239,5.5713,3.3016,4.1472,5.1773,1.1767,1.1433,2.2964,4.3018,0.4726,1.2518,0.3282,4.6317,5.5654,0.0863,1.6446,2.1116,3.2615,0.8111,3.2603,3.5609,0.6499,3.0443,0.2228,0.0517,1.037,5.5804,1.3366,2.8302,2.8164,0.0455,0.4499,0.6082,1.7264,4.194,3.5841,4.0254,3.4024,0.6043,2.0477,0.4913,1.0142,0.6669,6.3361,1.6558,1.7705,3.2566,6.3449,0.8216,0.4405,0.1154,0.6627,0.2018,0.3832,3.4511,3.5326,3.5389,4.0593,0.0704,4.1704,2.7491,3.6026,4.9527,5.2288,6.7837,3.6013,2.7198,2.4697,5.7387,3.1992,5.8268,1.7997,0.4382,0.8395,0.6886,0.2895,6.8777,2.3007,5.8144,9.2435,0.1094,1.3099,2.7608,5.7914,1.7294,5.8728,3.3952,1.7461,4.23,1.034,1.8468,1.7969,0.7847,4.2678,8.4194,5.5129,0.4173,1.6692,3.9085,2.9405,4.3118,0.3544,0.3131,0.0486,4.0029,1.1596,2.9227,7.4534,1.3973,7.9671,1.631,1.2567,2.197,2.0547,0.0807,1.7222,2.0082,2.0975,2.1248,2.6687,4.3854,0.0586,1.3119,1.0306,4.2761,1.2612,4.3431,3.6182,9.0388,7.2595,1.3245,0.7837,2.8058,0.0862,1.6388,5.587,0.1652,1.6053,4.1653,6.8899,3.5733,6.5931,4.5329,0.3827,6.0206,0.289,5.0434,0.0669,1.5927,0.3492,6.183,3.4261,2.1391,1.7777,5.1782,4.973,0.366,5.4552,1.0837,1.5753,2.9411,5.533,2.0599,1.5832,1.319,0.018,0.0253,5.7864,1.3195,1.9636,1.6727,2.2691,0.0599,0.0044,6.3926,1.5352,2.1447,2.8846,4.2922,2.337,0.8423,4.3589,1.1853,4.7857,1.3145,0.5409,0.0367,0.6985,0.9046,0.3924,0.0098,0.0239,4.0169,4.6444,2.0459,1.8102,1.5969,1.4179,4.5438,6.4736,1.6037,3.9899,5.0075,1.4499,3.2977,8.0859,0.8863,0.5884,5.2792,4.0143,0.1907,0.0899,0.0538,2.9531,1.7124,0.9884,1.005,2.7901,0.0426,1.3677,5.2134,0.9806,2.953,3.7307,2.1786,5.3497,2.9543,0.0184,3.9733,1.3324,2.4708,1.4383,0.0109,0.0073,3.0113,0.9667,2.1727,2.5375,4.6279,2.3037,2.0219,2.5791,2.0893,5.0037,5.3384,1.4203,1.3245,0.5678,3.1683,1.3318,3.2434,6.3203,1.4573,4.945,1.3688,5.3659,5.1992,5.5832,4.6968,2.23,4.1053,1.5344,0.5319,0.1028,0.0057,0.0031,0.7342,0.411,9.0371,4.3304,3.0834,4.6853,5.7843,4.4825,2.4367,5.3685,0.1832,4.2665,4.5175,5.1988,8.2327,0.8741,2.2484,0.0105,8.8005,4.0117,0.1435,4.998,1.1786,2.5491,1.6308,3.5953,0.2104,0.0242,0.0456,3.0859,2.0749,3.8553,1.8154,1.914,4.8019,0.7847,0.7658,0.1311,0.0048,0.005,0.4888,0.2536,1.9326,0.973,1.8198,4.5636,6.6317,0.0917,1.5354,0.2362,2.1952,3.8997,6.6449,1.2961,4.7789,1.5576,3.3464,1.0725,4.0575,2.9163,2.8599,7.0367,0.8089,2.8905,0.7063,1.5536,4.3988,1.7421,2.0849,3.4163,3.2148,2.9267,0.7485,1.9728,2.5991,0.7937,2.5235,2.8253,3.1526,1.6483,0.41,0.027,6.0516,5.2141,3.9227,3.4427,3.0859,4.7137,0.8597,3.3561,3.0904,1.5103,1.8634,0.0535,1.7747,1.3988,1.5248,0.7183,0.1253,3.7688,0.4742,2.0372,0.1358,1.5444,1.1089,4.051,0.0409,2.0449,1.6716,1.7322,5.2853,2.2837,4.9153,0.0376,0.0637,2.7195,1.8286,0.0182,3.3271,2.3832,2.4378,3.7762,2.04,1.3219,2.971,3.3743,0.2228,0.0053,0.06,6.8421,3.253,5.2785,7.182,2.3964,1.3807,4.0223,5.5813,1.7104,0.6264,8.0894,0.9656,0.8091,3.0737,0.6786,0.0106,0.0224,3.4034,0.3361,3.4423,3.6467,1.4236,2.5988,2.4736,2.6535,4.5253,6.3645,6.0289,1.7871,6.3757,0.9155,5.8027,1.896,3.5203,0.0084,0.8017,4.098,5.8782,3.7016,0.3404,1.4043,1.1364,2.9195,0.5871,3.6403,0.213,2.0845,3.0057,3.5724,1.9604,5.3968,1.4518,0.053,0.2278,1.087,1.0773,0.3646,5.1762,5.4364,0.3903,2.7771,3.3514,1.9003,0.3521,4.0345,0.4721,6.0314,2.3095,0.6305,2.2643,0.7934,2.5129,5.2581,1.8934,6.1754,7.57,0.5285,1.2664,0.0485,0.0434,0.0792,0.2223,3.2436,0.8187,0.0068,0.0481,6.0997,3.0778,4.0733,0.6558,4.5447,11.4279,2.8284,3.5863,9.9609,2.9486,0.4358,4.4352,1.4432,7.788,2.4481,0.3316,8.3418,3.6983,5.5767,4.0686,1.655,3.2774,0.2044,1.0562,3.485,2.1204,0.0047,0.5801,1.8195,2.0476,1.7249,0.6473,6.7189,1.7118,4.3202,4.1269,3.6065,4.0775,1.8857,0.1573,1.2535,0.0283,2.8639,0.1885,4.124,2.3742,1.5333,2.0654,6.1718,2.6454,1.9085,0.0157,0.1626,0.5183,1.2962,3.3654,3.0401,4.3945,1.1042,0.2261,1.4766,1.4935,2.3746,0.7544,0.4058,1.6301,3.1472,3.9011,1.6092,5.3402,1.2811,0.0108,1.2233,2.7664,2.2921,0.4825,4.7686,7.7954,5.5956,0.8135,6.3378,3.9016,0.5563,0.2293,0.2763,1.8363,0.2527,3.086,1.6561,7.8615,3.5496,2.4029,0.2851,1.9719,5.3029,4.1562,1.2272,0.0879,1.9567,1.3344]}
{"prompt":"A serial killer is dumping bodies in giant pumpkins . What are the reactions of the people who discover the bodies ?","text":"A serial killer is dumping bodies in giant pumpkins. What are the reactions of the people who discover the bodies? and what crime is he really guilty of???\nIt should be in a pumpkin. Not a coffin. He makes his victims believe that he takes them to the cemetery to bury them.\nThey were both found dead in the coffin with their head severed. I don't know if it was the right response though. I guess that's why we always say 'whoever it was, it was someone who hated pumpkins'.\nWhat if he was dumping the bodies right in front of a school, where kids are going into and out of everyday? Just me being silly. I guess my point is that the dead body is not going to bother anyone no more than a car crash. The fact that the parents will complain about seeing it with the body next to it doesn't mean anything.\nI think the person is still trying to convince the person who is looking after that the body should be buried in ground. The only difference is that he can hide them in a gigantic pumpkin. It is very effective way of doing that.\nWell I disagree with people saying he is trying to put the body in the ground. It makes more sense in the way he wants to hide it in a pumpkin. His intentions are clear but I don't think he is trying to hide it for the parents or the people who have come to look for the body.\nAll of those people in the beginning where the ones who are coming to look for the bodies. These are the parents. I don't like that fact he decided where to do it (near a school, or just in an isolated spot). He left the parents there and when he knows that the kids are coming he hurries and gets in the pumpkin. He does this because there will be no one else around and the parents will not see the body on the way. These people know what they are going to do, but the kids still do not know, because they didn't have the chance to see one of the bodies.\nI think he kills them while they are still in the coffin to avoid the parents seeing it, so they will forget about that they have seen the bodies and will be more likely to come and look for the child. Maybe this is the reason why he doesn't use any other tools than a coffin.\nOne of the dead bodies is in a pumpkin.What do you think of this crime? What are your reactions if the parents see the death? Why do you think the parents won't come back to find the dead children? Would you take away from a park on a busy day when you discover there is a pumpkin filled with bodies in?\nIn addition to what people have said, I think for the parents there is no way they will be able to find the bodies because of the pumpkin. I can't picture kids leaving the school, the dead bodies being taken from the coffin and put in the pumpkin.\nThe parents will probably be relieved though. It has a very nice ending to such a horror film. He may even get some sympathy from them as well. The main thing is that they found a way to hide the bodies from their worst nightmare.","token_len":654,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,2.6401,11.6398,4.9411,1.5157,8.4156,9.5291,0.3443,1.6602,5.1732,3.306,1.3717,7.7197,1.5294,1.2933,3.2917,0.6898,7.258,1.4899,2.5289,0.5274,8.0953,1.7353,8.8059,2.0775,5.4395,6.2135,3.1753,0.1015,7.4174,1.3848,6.9669,4.7612,0.4403,6.5713,3.5509,10.7247,1.973,5.2662,1.1499,5.6722,0.4213,4.9466,5.9141,3.1032,2.795,4.0292,1.1258,1.2902,7.2088,1.1379,1.237,1.5773,3.5206,2.3863,1.3805,0.5573,0.5206,2.1268,4.3479,4.9904,6.1363,4.6518,1.1231,1.4128,1.2067,5.0029,3.876,2.3686,3.8917,5.8717,0.7923,4.0261,2.4896,0.002,0.6494,1.2319,2.0089,0.7585,2.2988,5.4899,7.5408,5.6624,0.5304,2.4604,3.2578,3.0418,1.11,2.2542,3.5632,4.3634,3.3631,4.296,5.4299,4.8565,5.3382,1.1329,1.6176,1.4903,0.711,5.5736,2.3172,6.9328,9.1005,0.0005,0.9846,0.8984,3.6197,3.5095,2.4271,2.28,8.363,1.5044,0.5852,5.6923,1.9392,0.7191,0.0046,2.4426,5.0612,2.6491,3.1194,3.0387,1.932,3.1678,5.4916,5.1805,0.0226,0.2207,10.777,7.4266,6.4236,7.4854,3.3269,5.8548,0.9408,2.5865,2.9025,4.99,3.5495,0.4491,0.7129,2.5178,4.8846,4.2085,1.5335,2.43,3.2938,0.0745,6.759,2.4454,7.2215,4.3116,1.271,1.4174,4.9945,3.7061,1.2559,3.3571,4.6669,0.2903,1.838,5.1154,4.5244,6.2381,1.0214,5.8652,4.6528,4.8745,2.8473,4.2894,5.8438,0.1463,3.5421,3.3314,0.0007,2.1776,2.9495,0.7039,1.0646,2.1861,2.4808,1.949,5.276,3.9489,4.2584,3.5483,0.0317,3.8513,1.8712,3.7205,2.4726,2.6023,4.8882,2.9167,5.0606,2.334,1.8635,3.5426,0.5162,1.8613,1.5515,9.2274,2.7534,3.0163,3.7934,4.0631,0.5809,0.427,2.5174,3.6742,5.1009,4.8092,1.4623,1.2932,8.6746,3.4014,1.1431,3.4107,2.1322,3.8792,5.4859,7.3588,1.2977,3.9765,1.3916,0.4233,0.6406,5.6135,2.8029,7.5896,0.9549,5.3647,2.8159,4.4048,1.5519,3.5461,0.0158,4.7201,1.7861,1.4569,0.6449,2.0271,0.2941,0.8251,2.452,4.1373,3.5683,0.0449,3.835,1.7729,4.8278,1.5949,3.187,0.6678,3.26,1.2982,1.9145,1.0246,2.3475,0.4549,5.2585,4.5365,0.4921,3.3597,4.1005,2.6806,1.9894,0.0014,0.5661,1.2321,1.3216,1.1321,0.0268,1.7911,1.1858,5.9259,1.4693,5.9648,2.4604,1.3482,3.2462,0.701,2.9196,4.8093,0.7481,3.8076,2.4917,1.5186,0.5851,0.2839,0.9228,5.9669,2.423,3.7847,1.71,4.6824,0.6372,6.44,6.7162,2.7114,7.3537,0.7251,2.1508,5.1067,0.7008,0.7641,0.0935,0.2424,3.1928,4.7652,4.8467,1.0774,1.1299,3.9844,1.8721,2.5976,1.6304,0.001,3.4779,1.7226,6.264,4.3545,5.2755,8.0249,0.9386,5.311,1.0659,5.5838,8.1487,2.3117,1.678,2.4488,2.9125,4.3058,1.8739,4.2007,4.6977,2.4445,1.0899,2.8642,6.1975,1.4601,3.8827,3.3259,1.9361,5.2716,1.1451,7.8891,1.9523,1.3392,3.1133,0.8923,1.9384,2.3005,9.842,0.0313,3.8641,3.7662,3.1381,1.2325,3.7068,1.2733,2.1675,3.1773,1.7689,2.6539,3.84,4.1642,0.0727,2.3385,2.482,2.8669,3.131,2.6589,2.3458,2.752,0.965,2.4474,2.9799,1.7854,1.3076,6.0051,0.5153,2.4262,1.3688,6.3742,1.4439,4.4837,2.4202,1.7479,0.5268,2.9623,0.1003,0.7316,2.823,2.2054,2.9309,3.0575,4.9491,3.2619,0.1006,1.4186,4.5389,2.8437,0.8994,4.2988,0.0014,3.4794,1.5549,3.0349,0.235,1.0299,5.5905,0.8037,0.9304,1.5272,0.6416,0.774,2.1177,1.285,2.1139,8.9668,1.749,5.6893,0.8815,0.4532,2.3858,1.7617,0.2879,4.3954,4.4312,3.7394,1.8309,2.8334,3.1964,1.3672,3.2907,2.3684,2.0243,2.7963,5.6941,0.7897,3.9307,7.4122,2.4302,1.4584,1.1705,2.0283,1.9314,2.6489,2.8369,3.9163,2.8119,0.014,2.89,3.1111,2.0272,0.2362,0.9267,6.1667,0.9847,5.0245,3.2674,0.5325,2.1076,1.6653,0.7582,1.2415,3.5881,0.0008,4.3238,4.0196,3.4453,4.7181,4.0399,1.3937,5.3336,0.8082,0.9334,5.2293,1.2308,0.2654,6.8968,2.1991,1.7482,2.7329,0.9497,2.7344,0.6317,10.1787,2.1851,0.3408,0.2033,1.9039,1.1967,7.3453,0.5146,3.1708,2.3075,1.0023,3.5933,3.5874,2.7171,2.6466,2.4594,1.375,6.1409,1.4313,5.5136,2.0632,0.371,0.228,2.3272,1.5381,4.7352,0.0019,2.0294,3.2815,1.2042,3.2535,0.6486,2.2604,4.6789,0.4718,5.2921,0.4968,4.9639,4.8467,3.7171,3.8102,8.7122,5.7348,1.7967,3.9629,1.4571,3.8931,1.4015,8.9517,4.5362,1.2794,0.9932,2.3735,6.8353,0.2492,2.4363,2.2177,7.2017,1.039,4.7486,4.8954,0.4843,4.1571,3.4296,3.2838,0.6289,1.3804,0.9187,1.4126,7.011,1.335,2.1221,2.9055,0.8538,2.7745,2.3345,2.1605,0.793,2.6106,1.0338,0.0034,1.7616,0.516,1.7058,2.8305,1.924,0.5501,3.169,0.6039,2.1232,4.3333,1.1865,7.0656,5.7568,4.9247,1.4538,2.4181,3.0081,3.9672,4.0787,1.4189,4.2163,4.5137,2.9913,0.6794,7.087,1.9181,5.0128,0.7366,1.1225,3.086,0.4707,1.9098,2.832,2.4371,2.3152,3.0555,2.196,5.1361,6.1361,1.3273,2.8448,4.2031,4.0835,2.2536,3.6668,4.9988,2.3261,7.7365,0.3881,5.9642,2.6821,0.3658,7.1037,3.9755,3.4186,2.4553,2.0762,1.9313,1.2345,2.4343,3.4754,1.516,0.3148,3.7387,5.4344,1.7575,0.6349,0.6603,2.275,5.983,2.4232,3.8053,0.2035,2.737,0.4933,1.0358,3.1702,3.4778,8.0157,2.9339,0.4626]}
{"prompt":"Faced with the return of dragons , the people of Westeros turn to their only hope ... the Dragonborn .","text":"Faced with the return of dragons, the people of Westeros turn to their only hope... the Dragonborn. So how far has your city gone in embracing dragons? How big is the dragon population? How many dragons are in the city?\n*The Dragon City population is not directly affected by events currently in progress. However, the population of a city cannot be changed in response to the economy being affected.\n*The percentage of the population that is a dragon is not affected by events currently in progress. However, the population of a city cannot be changed in response to the economy being affected.\n*The number of Dragons on a city does not reflect the number of dragons present in the city at the time all Dragons move into the city - that decision must be made independently. However, the city can be attacked if the number of Dragons is too few... or too many.\n*The number of dragons in a city does not reflect the number of dragons that are currently occupying the city. The number of dragons on a city may be higher or lower at a given time simply because the city is under attack from another city or the other dragons may have moved away from the city.\n*If a city is not under attack it is not possible for a dragon to move in and inhabit the city. If a city has more dragons than others, it will be more likely to be attacked by other cities... or a faction of dragons. Once in the city there is no guarantee that additional dragons will be found in the city.\n*If a city is not under attack, it cannot be taken over or inhabited by a Dragon. The city can be moved on by the player. However, the city must have been inhabited by dragons, or if possible, a city can be moved on by the dragon with the highest level. Once a city has been moved on as a dragon home (with all other dragons having been removed), it will be considered to be under attack by the player.\n*The number of cities owned by a faction does not change during an event. If a dragon's city is destroyed by another city or another faction the dragon is free to move around the map. However, the city it is found remains theirs.\n*Once a city is moved on it cannot be moved back since moving the city on as a dragon's home will always make it under attack by the other cities. It is also possible for a city to be moved on by one or more dragons. Once a dragon has moved on a city there is no guarantee the other dragons will follow.\n*Each dragon home counts as a city for the purposes of this event. It is possible for a dragon to go through the process of changing its city, destroying the city it found, finding a new city and moving it onto the map.\n*As long as a city is under attack by other cities it is not safe to return to it.

{"prompt":"Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest if the world . Everyone naturally blames climate change , you know the horrifying truth","text":"Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest if the world. Everyone naturally blames climate change, you know the horrifying truth.\nSpoiler alert: It\u2019s not a \u201cnew cold\u201d. Even in the cold of the Arctic there will always be a small amount of water vapor in the air. As we get warmer, the vapor can evaporate off at a faster rate.\nIt\u2019s a real shame that the media still doesn\u2019t use the \u201cnew\u201d. We know that all the cold water will be gone because we have a thermometer in the Arctic that registers 100 below. I never heard that the term \u201creally colder\u201d or \u201cthe new colder\u201d.\nAlso in the Arctic we have a new warmer, which also means that there won\u2019t be any more ice this winter or next in the Arctic. But in a globalized world who wants to worry about small Arctic changes? Who wants to worry about the global warming that is only a few degrees? It\u2019s more about international politics than science, that\u2019s my opinion.\nThe whole idea in a climate debate is to try to get a consensus on the facts and on what\u2019s on the table as far as different groups of interest are concerned.\nBut the consensus is that we are getting warmer. Some of us might get it more clearly than others, but we must all be aware now that we are. The science can\u2019t be changed, but the facts about the climate remain constant. And we agree that there are certain things that we want to try to do, regardless of our different views about the reality of climate change.\nHow do we know that science is correct? Well, as it is not the place of the science, I won\u2019t go into that, but it\u2019s just that the science doesn\u2019t change, no matter what you see. Maybe my memory is off, but I remember being told that in the 80s the warming was an absolute joke. Just as it is a joke now. I know this to be true.\nThe debate about the \u201cnew cold\u201d isn\u2019t important as far as I\u2019m concerned. Everyone knows that there isn\u2019t one since time immemorial. And as for the new warming, well it might take us more time to figure that out, so until then we simply accept that we are warming.\nI think that the media is doing a pretty good job not to confuse people with \u201cnew cold\u201d. I know this because I have seen the articles on the internet: they only have \u201cnew cold\u201d in their headline and it isn\u2019t actually \u201cnew\u201d. But then again it\u2019s funny that the \u201cnew cold\u201d is only getting coverage when the Arctic gets colder.\nI mean, sure there is a \u201cnew cold\u201d, as you\u2019ve said, but it\u2019s really nothing more than what I\u2019ve always said: a small, short-lived dip in temperature in an already cold climate that\u2019s part of the natural cycle.","token_len":657,"entropy":[3.8827,9.1861,8.6014,2.2483,1.3314,5.0976,0.145,0.1098,1.9879,3.3541,10.3358,1.9226,3.0266,9.2158,8.6537,10.1302,4.7314,2.5796,0.0353,2.2325,6.5952,0.8029,4.9806,11.5399,2.133,0.6938,1.3617,18.4687,0.4344,0.2979,3.0471,13.9283,8.578,1.3828,1.8178,2.96,12.629,4.5949,7.0287,6.5112,4.2071,7.2263,2.1631,5.9954,3.3969,1.024,3.516,5.7673,0.9474,1.5872,4.1696,4.5086,2.9794,0.0397,1.7721,4.6264,1.6866,0.0288,3.2952,2.0259,1.8977,0.2621,1.5857,1.0388,4.1041,3.0663,3.2028,0.8486,1.1143,1.8086,2.5498,4.2696,3.0702,0.0005,3.976,6.2385,1.8812,1.2966,0.0623,1.3897,2.6067,3.8876,2.2929,0.0965,0.0096,2.2785,5.7369,6.3075,0.9153,1.7379,6.2222,5.4893,3.3765,0.3938,2.1006,0.063,5.7265,1.5435,5.08,0.8694,1.9492,2.0294,0.5428,2.0715,3.6947,3.4131,0.9212,5.5082,1.4627,4.8195,3.7455,4.2569,2.197,3.2287,4.9524,2.5148,2.5749,3.0561,7.3016,0.1866,2.9232,1.2751,4.7396,1.63,6.7038,7.4384,8.6292,3.6558,4.5852,5.6571,2.3978,3.0105,2.8017,7.8383,1.1995,0.0476,8.5915,8.505,0.2152,0.3706,4.4606,0.9736,0.1352,3.8403,3.8471,6.0832,0.4123,0.0211,2.7639,1.3563,5.1702,4.4823,0.8631,1.7371,3.033,1.0026,1.7384,4.142,6.1475,4.5124,4.2801,5.378,0.8638,1.3994,2.2034,4.4566,0.6344,0.1703,0.556,0.0861,1.4523,2.2751,1.9899,6.6772,0.8345,4.8765,1.3922,5.8749,0.5514,1.8741,0.3696,4.6441,3.7254,3.7827,5.4065,6.3219,0.4071,7.2192,1.6406,0.2494,6.1172,0.0794,8.4627,6.1376,4.4639,1.2083,4.3182,1.0845,0.2576,1.2448,0.0807,2.2116,4.3133,0.31,2.2198,1.2678,5.7773,4.3579,1.4524,0.9508,3.0064,4.0797,1.0474,0.0248,0.0159,5.5943,4.0937,6.605,3.8615,1.664,3.8549,2.959,4.0596,2.4049,0.194,0.2447,5.9613,3.575,0.2186,0.5976,2.8155,5.1196,3.3172,6.4082,4.0857,2.733,4.7005,0.4001,1.0257,4.006,0.3776,3.1068,2.3867,2.8718,1.3055,1.6736,3.2777,1.9035,6.0282,1.7726,3.6678,0.6287,1.5093,6.3835,0.5211,1.8285,5.08,3.155,0.0326,8.1705,4.4922,1.5747,8.9916,1.525,0.0166,0.1836,1.952,3.0648,2.5593,5.6589,1.2126,2.4672,2.588,1.3317,3.3998,1.3638,2.0501,5.8004,2.0532,1.5197,4.3336,4.8575,3.6679,4.7153,6.4049,1.6623,0.0787,1.5362,0.7357,2.4651,4.4419,3.3024,2.358,2.0618,7.3893,0.5665,2.0573,0.3957,7.8179,3.1451,5.4635,4.605,3.1641,0.14,0.0207,2.4646,3.7972,1.9099,1.7499,1.5796,3.0778,6.2896,1.3104,1.6762,5.0075,4.8382,0.3621,3.5848,2.6075,7.9325,0.7842,2.4668,1.6182,4.873,1.4308,0.6222,2.0025,4.2727,0.2946,5.2166,0.3251,2.8991,2.268,6.2485,0.0578,3.183,5.9384,2.8488,2.6645,1.082,4.6345,0.7618,1.3686,0.0417,0.2533,0.5853,5.1968,1.7423,0.9011,2.7938,1.2437,5.9373,0.8869,2.2093,0.406,2.224,0.2821,3.853,3.804,2.6846,4.3295,3.2866,4.8121,2.7341,2.7576,1.8778,1.6235,2.7256,4.6567,0.9279,0.0465,1.0475,2.8151,0.5262,3.1094,3.0249,0.6643,2.6016,1.8125,0.0154,0.0134,4.444,3.0483,2.7833,2.5079,3.5824,0.3652,0.0567,0.0125,3.5704,3.4005,4.4612,0.0852,0.9372,2.3901,5.3292,1.9634,6.4556,5.6169,7.9152,0.9221,4.9384,1.5485,0.474,1.1167,4.1379,4.4609,2.3325,1.0048,4.1608,1.1721,5.6563,0.3219,2.3585,5.8185,1.3431,5.5331,4.4914,4.7978,1.0074,6.0628,3.0099,2.6537,1.032,3.931,0.9654,0.8995,2.4498,3.1585,3.5248,3.3148,4.3673,0.0594,0.127,1.1118,1.0172,2.904,5.6642,2.1967,1.6249,3.8468,0.1923,0.7358,2.3883,0.1155,0.0174,4.7375,0.3908,0.3022,0.015,6.7786,4.5102,2.7292,0.0049,1.8921,4.9231,0.0216,0.4554,0.0307,0.3484,6.0661,1.7784,0.5791,2.4835,4.6036,0.3429,0.0291,0.0023,4.7766,10.9215,6.7046,0.1224,0.0002,0.0002,0.6329,2.9804,3.5425,3.6912,0.9062,3.5319,4.3415,0.6338,4.0106,3.2522,5.4107,4.6198,3.7316,4.4101,2.0873,0.8389,2.5529,1.8706,0.0357,1.8705,3.6241,7.1668,0.5924,1.9588,5.8634,6.0863,0.936,2.2431,0.6296,2.473,1.8703,0.7669,2.6044,3.1649,1.5612,2.1093,5.462,1.5424,2.9482,1.3023,2.9313,0.2035,0.0035,6.7811,2.5549,4.4418,2.5994,2.0758,5.7638,0.0794,1.2782,0.4892,0.3273,0.0079,0.596,2.2335,3.0012,3.1265,1.2676,0.6721,1.605,2.2232,2.0964,4.2138,1.9725,1.153,2.6405,6.203,5.4004,5.3533,3.8381,4.416,0.1591,0.8871,0.29,0.074,0.0056,2.9017,1.3846,2.5489,2.3941,3.7183,4.0916,0.1533,0.0502,0.0154,4.9644,2.6517,0.0243,0.3757,6.4041,0.0027,0.5073,3.1661,4.6896,1.2507,3.1306,2.4723,0.0079,0.045,5.9818,1.6582,1.8688,4.5428,0.0552,0.2619,0.6404,0.0241,0.0016,1.1641,3.5532,5.4737,9.1687,3.3146,1.7956,5.8191,2.9607,1.7112,0.5547,0.9026,2.2675,2.9111,0.8963,4.9856,3.0898,1.4525,1.3218,3.2589,0.1132,0.1645,0.222,0.2282,0.004,1.9833,5.6318,2.8876,6.5852,0.5755,0.6907,2.5874,0.8088,0.2724,1.7666,1.3331,0.0076,0.093,3.7078,4.6671,2.7264,0.1024,4.7347,2.9237,3.3104,0.0644,2.0002,4.68,1.1413,2.744,3.1799,5.0664,2.6779,4.3546,1.4753,0.7777,8.392,0.3189,1.8822,3.1534,4.1861,4.7826,1.7547,3.2409,3.4645,4.3578,0.0387,1.1523,7.0979,0.0801,0.9821,3.0646,0.3759,0.8328]}
{"prompt":"You are a hitman who faked their own death to live out the rest of your days in peace . You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous 'marks ' is there alive and well .","text":"You are a hitman who faked their own death to live out the rest of your days in peace. You are attending your own funeral service when you notice one of your previous'marks'is there alive and well. You go into the house, where a police officer is standing in the doorway who is pointing a gun at you. In a moment you both lose focus and you go from shooting the unarmed cop to shooting the next person in line to being killed.\nMy mother died about a year ago and when I visited her house on my first visit back from the cemetery that I never entered her last moment.\nTo be brutally honest, the first one was more like a warning. When I left the first building, I quickly left the place when I realized things were not right, like the room was too cold. Then, I ran back to see what was happening as I saw that I was the cause of it. I was trying to take some books out from the bag when it disappeared all of a sudden. I looked around in shock, and I thought it would be an accident, but it was just gone. Then I remember thinking,'what if it's a trap? This is just too bizarre,'so I ran the other way to search for it. I looked over the room again, the bed was made and everything was in it's place. I was so shocked that I left the house to get away. Then later, I saw her sitting at the table, still alive with the covers open. Then I realized she was still alive. It was like she was a ghost. What the hell was going on and who had done this to her?\nAt one point I was talking to myself in my own head and I said,'I'm not scared of them, but I'm not going to help them either,'meaning my friends.\nIt was like being caught up in a movie, except I would go through it all over again knowing it wasn't real and I wouldn't have it in the movie.\nAs a senior in high school, I was placed in the Special Projects Club (or I guess you could call it \" The Outsiders \"). Some of my classmates were assigned to it, while others were assigned to it to sabotage it. The first two months, we watched videos about terrorism in the Middle East. We watched them every Thursday night, and the next Thursday, the club decided we did not need to do the videos anymore. In fact, we did two days' worth of work in about an hour. We had to go over everything in school that could have a bad impact on society, and put a plan in place for how to prevent those effects. One of the major threats our class had focused on was guns. We saw videos and statistics such as how guns are becoming more effective for criminals in their crimes. We were not allowed to use any of the statistics and videos we had seen because we made those decisions to \" prevent terrorism.\" In my opinion, this was wrong and an example of \" overthinking.\" I believe that we need to look at the real threat that guns pose and not the media. Many guns in America do not work right and people go to the police to have shots fired just to get guns that work right.","token_len":660,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,9.3725,2.8237,3.1126,10.0654,5.8822,1.5406,0.3151,1.8598,5.9811,2.6246,2.4134,2.3387,0.0099,1.1876,3.1917,1.8994,5.0808,1.0071,1.8576,1.3692,11.0624,3.4839,2.6211,0.6734,4.1633,4.0116,1.2718,6.0929,4.8477,0.3021,0.6409,7.3737,15.2626,5.8779,5.7947,10.776,4.9313,7.387,2.8602,0.4431,0.539,1.5742,4.8713,2.9931,0.9971,3.0114,1.8934,2.9972,2.6251,6.1904,0.4668,1.5312,2.624,2.8893,0.9892,0.7466,5.0395,1.5175,5.3376,0.381,0.6798,0.2696,0.5193,0.4632,4.8221,1.8886,2.2633,2.2298,6.3414,4.8189,4.4849,0.8896,3.0534,5.0426,4.9665,5.4801,2.1976,7.5747,3.9779,0.9135,2.7994,1.0236,5.9344,3.2157,1.0155,1.4743,2.9778,4.9897,3.1306,0.8717,2.3418,8.2822,4.7652,3.7893,5.8123,1.5983,0.5959,0.1778,2.2019,4.3584,0.53,5.923,0.7642,2.8413,3.9522,2.4435,2.8894,1.6372,3.4755,4.0963,1.6721,5.7491,4.8105,2.1477,4.3166,6.7005,3.832,8.3077,5.3638,1.0339,3.2547,5.7953,2.2083,4.9439,0.0668,0.9305,3.3016,2.8441,5.6022,4.4735,4.6744,2.7211,1.3196,7.0887,1.8159,3.776,0.7665,4.5803,1.5263,4.2131,7.5317,1.8305,0.7605,6.3889,4.2347,0.9213,6.2099,4.4568,0.4313,2.724,7.593,0.636,2.3064,3.5766,3.6328,4.1154,1.8409,7.1381,1.3862,2.7191,3.6536,1.5154,3.7343,2.3263,1.3416,4.4371,2.6437,0.9517,4.4751,1.575,0.728,1.6562,5.5742,0.6763,3.7458,2.9902,2.7455,0.8785,3.7193,7.0944,0.1354,5.036,0.8009,1.4804,2.3955,4.779,0.0961,4.5411,3.9728,9.9631,1.8071,3.1358,0.8142,5.2704,3.3184,4.1329,5.4813,6.4209,3.0278,0.0502,0.0003,0.6787,0.9911,3.3947,2.3069,3.8386,2.1206,1.8527,1.9288,1.8429,4.6567,2.5135,2.8738,0.5386,4.2687,2.79,1.6863,0.5192,2.0047,1.2354,3.0592,7.4577,0.5585,3.3528,0.7062,5.1968,2.745,11.9476,3.1487,2.7222,1.571,1.3403,2.7554,4.4791,2.0368,4.5192,0.7011,3.3947,4.562,6.2215,3.6662,6.6597,0.2762,2.8796,6.1984,3.2647,0.0584,2.7178,6.7766,1.0594,0.651,0.6995,1.1926,3.2651,4.0274,2.3687,4.2896,3.1782,1.1893,4.9335,6.0948,0.9064,6.1415,4.6648,3.2581,0.6225,3.249,3.1162,4.2202,0.4025,0.4176,0.9772,2.7597,2.6674,2.1029,1.4436,0.3331,4.306,1.085,1.2512,3.6471,2.9623,4.9805,1.8802,3.7079,6.7295,1.7034,1.0376,2.1821,4.9634,3.4897,2.6192,0.721,2.17,1.8281,4.5671,2.0868,3.5851,1.6613,6.6639,5.3326,0.8005,3.6944,0.6098,2.7903,2.2142,0.5629,3.5095,0.9835,1.3591,3.4709,0.6556,1.9575,1.5843,0.5499,3.8509,1.9964,0.8431,5.584,3.0569,0.2515,1.3745,1.3476,0.0502,4.7296,3.6542,4.2954,2.8649,0.5149,0.8611,0.2494,0.3818,1.0212,4.5022,3.2334,0.0641,1.3308,2.1212,3.9653,0.2153,3.9057,2.8306,1.4124,4.1464,0.557,1.7408,0.7469,2.2103,3.7547,1.8585,2.4019,1.687,3.7662,1.0607,4.2183,1.8078,2.2636,0.9402,0.8038,2.6561,3.3994,0.033,4.7737,0.6451,5.2704,3.5191,7.7597,4.0299,4.7315,1.7962,1.9488,3.6287,0.9774,2.729,3.7786,4.5543,2.3207,0.0608,0.934,4.4641,2.3832,5.6179,1.7564,4.4421,3.5102,3.3927,2.5675,3.0472,3.0013,0.0369,6.849,3.0796,2.585,0.0003,2.1607,2.2484,1.605,2.0825,0.0005,2.9596,4.7592,2.7172,3.1922,4.4474,0.581,1.4061,4.5614,2.3326,7.578,2.4333,0.97,0.0164,0.6554,0.478,1.4691,6.7102,0.6646,1.6362,5.3577,4.1448,7.8676,4.0057,5.5909,5.8483,5.4703,4.1159,0.5708,0.6393,0.1379,3.1797,8.043,9.9388,0.5661,1.793,1.7057,6.167,0.7621,1.1127,1.441,1.6076,4.8273,0.3179,4.9517,1.7012,4.1661,0.5953,0.6307,1.8182,0.2409,2.2703,3.5224,10.2462,1.359,0.4388,2.7716,3.6489,3.641,4.7036,2.2921,3.2195,5.8143,5.8444,3.1107,6.9673,3.1029,1.3241,3.0286,0.0517,1.5317,2.0448,2.0114,3.603,3.5407,5.8138,1.1431,1.7365,1.6055,3.018,1.5568,3.3776,1.3434,3.2713,6.687,5.0899,3.0669,5.7505,0.8459,2.2629,0.5821,4.0607,3.1054,2.0435,1.9075,0.4741,3.974,1.6869,0.1022,1.0127,2.6982,7.3147,2.8948,5.72,0.6207,0.1697,3.2389,2.7946,6.7596,3.3005,0.0121,0.8425,2.1817,2.8205,1.3296,2.9153,4.4803,2.9098,2.8222,6.4687,2.5816,5.0474,3.3241,5.5406,4.6581,1.4662,0.2279,4.8293,1.632,1.2845,6.17,3.2892,4.863,0.6281,0.0811,2.4187,1.6732,0.8312,3.0267,4.2083,2.1181,0.7872,4.3278,0.8932,0.4999,5.495,4.9155,5.0326,3.7076,2.479,8.2321,0.2569,0.3756,5.6361,0.4962,1.9187,4.0025,2.9389,3.6255,8.0886,6.9242,0.0069,2.9251,3.8815,1.5537,3.8215,0.8955,5.8932,5.075,4.5948,3.5623,3.7576,4.8825,0.8216,1.5115,2.5175,4.1756,2.664,0.0711,2.7001,3.5357,1.8235,1.6261,7.2461,3.6405,5.3466,1.7375,1.7308,1.6823,4.1213,1.3538,7.0895,4.8651,2.1238,3.3621,6.12,8.7377,3.5769,2.6954,3.6853,3.707,2.741,0.138,2.4238,0.8932,5.0473,1.7147,5.1874,2.9002,0.1395,3.742,8.2159,1.9837,3.903,2.4394,4.6664,1.1732,2.4038,3.6364,0.156,3.9001,0.4982,1.4217,3.0792,2.804,2.5597,3.6203,0.2389,2.1388,3.0302,2.0364,4.9716,2.2286,6.2229,5.52,3.0087,2.7027,4.3377,0.3674,4.7114,6.4131,2.3427,4.1791,5.1249,0.9729,1.551,2.3185,1.8308,4.9578,5.8596,0.3634,5.4412,0.6586,1.4122,3.9828,4.1907,2.3472,3.0026,0.2191]}

{"prompt":"You are told that you are about to enter a room with one person that wants to kill you , and two people who would do anything to save your life . Inside , you find your two best friends and your crush .","text":"You are told that you are about to enter a room with one person that wants to kill you, and two people who would do anything to save your life. Inside, you find your two best friends and your crush. You realize that the one person you were supposed to be fighting might even be the killer, and the only person that has a chance of saving you might never show up. The clock is running and you decide that maybe you\u2019ll be able to save yourself or have the time of your life. You enter the cell with your choice of who\u2019s on the other end.\nThis film was made in the 1980s and I saw it in an old college film society. I don\u2019t know for how many years afterwards I kept the cassette, I think it was an audio visual college thing you had to bring in yourself, or it\u2019d be sent home if you couldn\u2019t pick it up. Once I had it in my hands, I decided to finally read it, which took me years. I read it a couple of years ago and I watched it last night and found the experience to be oddly similar.\nThis film is based in a world in which the state is militarized and you have to have a government license if you want the basic functions of a life\u2014transportation, communication, shelter, and so forth. They also have regular people called government inspectors who can get you killed without legal justification and you can get a license without getting killed. As such, the residents of this society make their living by keeping up appearances of freedom and independence and having good reputations.\nWhen it comes to relationships the relationships are strained and usually only between people connected to each other in one way or another. The relationships are often based on friendship and trust, but they are also very sexual. The relationships are based on sex, not on love.

{"prompt":"When Pandora shut her box , she left one evil sealed inside . It has remained dormant to this day .","text":"When Pandora shut her box, she left one evil sealed inside. It has remained dormant to this day. I shall give you a good look, and you see what I mean. You are as good as good enough. I think I have what is needed. I can get you out. I can get you back and let you live your life. I can even get your family out \u2026 but you must agree.\u201d Her voice filled with sadness. \u201d I suppose we will see.\u201d He thought that he could do nothing else then say yes. His daughter had asked. He would not do her daughter a dishonour. He would do it for their family. He would do it for his love for her.\nThe guards had to unchain Pandora\u2019s chest when she opened it. She was very weak and in need of medical attention. She was put to rest in an old castle. Pandora\u2019s family came out of the chest.\nA spell of time had passed. Pandora never saw those who had come from her chest. She could remember only that a new life had been born, for her daughter had become a successful scientist and her husband and son a well respected doctor. They went on being successful. They had children and grandchildren. Their name became legend in the local village. For some reason, there was a statue set up in the middle of the forest. This statue was made of stone, not gold. It was not known the exact origin of the statue. Some said it had been found from the heart of the earth, some said it had come from a star system of another galaxy, just as it had come out of Pandora\u2019s chest \u2026\n\u201cThey left that night, taking just one of my daughters life. No gold, jewels, anything. \u201d I said. \u201cYes Father. I can see that. We are all going to be rich from this. We are all going to be rich!\u201d I said. \u201cLet us return. \u201c \u2026\u201d They left that night, taking just one of my daughters life. No gold, jewels, anything. And I am glad for it. \u201c\nThe story of Pandora and the box ended here. The next morning, all the villagers gathered at the church to see the statue. They were taken back to their sleep by two small white doves. They returned to the castle, each carrying a gift. One carried a small gold box, the other carried a small golden bowl of fruit and the fruit of the tree of life.\nThe golden bowl was placed on the table of the castle, with the golden bowl of fruit. They were then taken to the top of the hill, where the Golden Door opened. They entered.\nThe Golden Door was like a small box, only it was smaller and a little higher. Inside was a gold room filled with small golden boxes. A golden bird flew up at them. He took the food of life to them. They stayed in the golden room for a few hours. They could not find any way out of the room, they had never seen the Golden Door before and never wanted to go back. They sat in the golden room and ate and drank and lived on the love of God.","token_len":662,"entropy":[12.8847,9.7527,4.678,5.3289,0.8877,1.516,5.5591,5.5398,9.0548,9.7974,2.1115,1.5385,3.2849,5.1163,5.4184,3.4812,4.9608,0.0793,0.0824,0.6475,5.0086,5.9992,4.9846,1.1304,1.5956,4.4575,2.8913,3.6302,2.0944,2.126,6.1301,2.3741,1.0725,1.8266,0.6663,3.3015,3.0653,5.1521,2.2081,0.1764,6.8884,5.2961,1.4064,1.9651,4.4845,1.3946,2.2112,5.2359,4.2939,2.0719,1.0582,1.5986,3.5255,4.0712,0.813,3.2837,3.0501,1.6447,2.1917,1.5967,0.1297,2.1385,5.4224,5.2339,0.147,2.4824,2.5186,0.437,1.1634,1.6212,2.1335,4.2185,1.4595,4.1612,3.2714,1.6088,9.6344,2.8531,1.9248,2.7602,6.8591,1.8847,12.0398,10.521,8.1655,1.2729,5.1531,0.1254,3.91,1.0158,4.2697,2.2714,2.3098,6.5041,2.8006,2.8806,3.0055,1.3573,2.1765,0.3427,4.8865,4.8787,3.9582,3.4453,1.3945,2.9173,2.9235,4.2824,6.2439,5.5865,5.6117,0.6582,4.3994,5.64,2.7407,5.06,4.4237,1.9553,2.8744,1.9414,2.5654,5.1359,6.2087,3.6338,6.0521,0.7827,0.922,1.3664,1.0354,3.1731,2.3802,1.9645,5.9023,3.3002,0.518,1.5592,0.8781,1.0749,0.0798,0.4743,1.6876,5.957,3.3701,0.7648,0.3847,3.8185,8.0773,7.3454,3.302,4.0438,7.8517,5.152,3.49,9.8393,7.6827,7.0895,4.8286,4.4249,1.0351,3.1697,0.443,0.5295,2.0525,2.2032,4.5775,3.7397,2.1659,5.0889,2.1184,0.0451,3.3109,0.8775,0.3596,1.7713,1.3658,5.8068,2.6666,4.728,1.9253,3.1334,3.9806,5.4696,1.1555,3.6709,5.1961,0.5849,0.1013,4.0238,4.7155,3.0553,1.3336,0.7056,8.2218,1.4324,2.4762,3.6905,8.2458,3.5993,5.7991,2.1309,3.0201,0.8402,2.4107,6.9771,2.8256,5.4738,2.2952,1.866,3.236,3.2918,2.7755,5.409,0.8486,1.3352,2.9668,4.9294,2.3794,3.1874,4.0937,5.6741,4.3808,0.9866,1.6015,0.8733,2.5924,4.9658,2.5488,2.7937,1.4966,3.9766,1.5053,7.9646,5.8434,1.9098,3.8564,2.5893,4.2352,3.0892,5.3777,4.005,4.1403,3.0297,0.1888,2.8149,5.2768,1.7499,7.0341,3.6073,1.702,1.8305,1.8124,3.9884,1.7265,1.0663,0.5879,3.6091,4.714,4.842,5.6512,2.427,0.827,4.9755,3.6555,0.3901,5.8045,3.4095,0.9444,0.4805,3.7835,0.8295,1.2219,6.6328,7.3528,0.6,1.2821,0.714,3.0389,0.0302,0.3294,2.9231,1.1051,3.8436,1.1736,1.1464,3.8365,0.7324,2.4505,1.8432,4.7433,3.8651,0.275,1.4034,0.889,4.1102,5.141,5.5581,2.9777,3.3432,0.1791,0.6768,1.0108,0.9585,4.1592,4.4977,0.7268,2.7409,0.5805,3.7847,4.8744,1.1783,6.091,0.6475,1.2323,5.1424,1.56,3.6737,0.4425,0.1021,0.538,3.1888,0.1063,1.6719,6.2157,5.4597,4.665,4.2879,2.3114,2.0464,6.6287,1.6255,1.7804,1.0572,1.0923,4.4851,0.5019,2.2841,1.723,0.2059,0.2268,1.1125,7.8575,2.6017,2.3562,6.5909,6.9542,4.2555,4.2624,5.4194,2.0414,5.8883,7.0349,2.1217,1.692,5.9966,2.8133,12.3086,0.7424,4.8018,8.8776,1.4657,8.304,0.6828,4.1048,0.6368,3.7311,1.0437,2.3994,5.5047,3.1147,0.8933,3.5267,4.0493,10.8144,0.6333,2.0751,3.4932,2.7626,2.6225,1.9139,3.9055,2.0524,2.6464,3.3551,0.2991,1.9019,6.3467,4.7756,0.9905,0.9029,1.73,1.3516,1.2633,0.0568,0.0041,0.7108,1.8846,6.7627,1.8036,0.2039,3.3407,2.2602,0.5735,0.6678,2.6775,4.7984,1.5586,5.1598,2.3347,2.6097,3.7781,10.2648,2.1707,0.6607,3.9518,1.4351,3.0876,0.3278,1.1416,2.1248,0.2477,0.0146,0.0441,0.0677,0.0441,0.0188,0.0475,0.0911,0.0061,0.0019,0.004,0.0012,0.0013,0.0064,5.1819,2.1896,3.6451,4.6543,3.2163,3.0525,0.2212,2.3884,2.9144,3.4574,2.2879,5.4438,1.1986,0.8502,2.8953,1.662,7.5154,5.1074,3.5377,0.3367,2.4586,4.3092,2.1797,0.526,5.2579,1.1955,2.9213,2.572,2.2813,0.4568,5.1258,1.3984,3.2131,1.8166,3.6309,0.8412,1.7539,2.0175,4.9804,2.9549,0.4422,1.6897,8.7617,2.5867,5.5283,5.5715,4.8053,8.0373,0.1402,0.696,1.3493,6.3502,0.7054,1.1298,2.3673,1.9055,5.8533,2.9172,0.5416,5.1542,1.3234,3.0993,4.8726,0.4927,3.0476,3.3217,3.0058,1.7441,1.1555,0.05,3.1653,0.2525,1.7504,3.9618,5.9939,3.1292,4.9195,2.8646,3.2165,5.9318,3.1292,1.5162,3.2323,2.9534,0.9081,0.3382,1.7026,1.8502,5.4138,1.012,1.174,3.374,1.6045,0.6631,2.6724,3.6346,0.4916,2.7853,1.8821,3.5259,1.0327,4.2557,1.5712,2.8042,0.4724,2.3526,3.4092,2.3748,3.3047,1.8151,1.1437,0.5348,5.8983,0.2535,0.1977,3.1785,1.6497,0.5648,1.7185,6.4844,6.4708,2.1298,0.5984,2.4769,3.9429,2.1717,1.0519,1.4108,2.7854,0.0781,1.1424,5.1906,0.4204,4.125,4.4317,1.8891,4.0722,2.5081,0.8385,3.0954,1.9264,4.5223,0.638,4.1185,0.9985,4.0776,1.532,0.4064,4.1073,7.6971,2.4793,0.0158,5.2039,3.351,3.4621,0.5071,3.4685,3.1919,5.6387,2.5721,2.2087,4.0699,1.1792,1.0339,3.4343,3.9585,1.6762,6.271,4.1754,8.2405,4.2989,3.523,1.0521,2.432,6.4103,1.9329,0.5403,0.5797,1.0448,1.0899,1.0197,1.522,1.8691,0.9377,2.4543,4.1306,1.5068,3.5735,1.6253,4.713,0.8621,1.2527,0.6654,2.5361,1.9176,3.4115,2.0467,5.0193,1.4484,2.554,2.2863,0.0538,0.8879,3.234,3.8108,4.1171,0.1186,2.3892,0.5104,0.6894,1.5271,4.8982,1.6629,0.3773,0.3874,0.0955,1.8774,1.8265,3.4634,1.3164,1.9799,6.0645,4.6983,0.8821,8.6383,1.0204,5.5733,0.4905]}
{"prompt":"Batman is arrested . The day of his trial , the Joker shows up to defend him .","text":"Batman is arrested. The day of his trial, the Joker shows up to defend him. The jury finds that the masked assassin is innocent, so he is released from prison. The Joker was happy because Batman is now back in the free world, but it is soon revealed that the masked assassin is actually alive. He had been in a coma. But instead of being put in a psych ward, his cellmate in prison had been giving the Joker morphine and a strong sedative to keep him unconscious. Batman returns to his place of occupation, but the crime is on the rise. Batman tries to stop the criminals, but in the process, he is shot. There is some tension between the Batman and Joker.\nWhen they break out of prison in their escape car, they are hit by a truck. It then breaks down. In the scene, the maniac Joker pulls out a shotgun and fires at Batman. The hit hits Batman in the leg. He manages to get away, but Batman is now in intensive care. The next day, the Batmans nurse comes to check on his condition. A nurse named Rachel Dawes is also the love interest of the Batman. When he walks away from intensive care with the help of an oxygen tank, the Joker is holding a gun to Rachel. The next morning, Rachel dies from her injuries in the hospital and the Joker vows she will leave Gotham city as soon as possible. The Batman was so distraught he went into a depression about how he could not protect her, no matter what. He was then found in the batcave, which now has graffiti all over it because of the Batman\u2019s absence.\nHe comes out of the batcave, only to find that the criminal activities are continuing out in the streets. He then finds that out about it from a radio broadcast. But all they say about it are rumors and that people believe that it\u2019s true, but they are not sure enough. There is a flashback to where the Joker and Catwoman went undercover in Gotham City. They were arrested. The Batman then decides it\u2019s time to put the masked assassin back into custody. His first priority is the Joker. He also learns that the Joker killed Rachel. He then decides to kill the Joker. He takes the Joker to the Justice League Headquarters and gives him a few pills to give him a sedative. He then takes them to the hospital and the batcave and the Joker is knocked out. The Joker wakes up when the masked assassin has thrown the Joker outside the hospital. As he walks around the hospital area, the Joker can see the Batman going in and gets in the way and makes him fall. The Batman turns around and goes after the Joker, only to be shot and killed by the Joker.\nThe Joker then leaves his body and finds his new body nearby.

{"prompt":"Sunday Free Write : Space Oddity Edition","text":"Sunday Free Write : Space Oddity Edition :) \u00bb (Oasis). On ne s\u2019y trompe pas : d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980 le groupe britannique est un des grands incontournables de la sc\u00e8ne rock anglo-saxonne. Oasis s\u2019impose d\u2019ailleurs pendant onze ans dans le groupe des New Wave, et le titre \u00e0 succ\u00e8s \u00ab Sweet Child O\u2019Mine \u00bb (1991) devient le titre le plus vendu de la d\u00e9cennie. Leur album \u00ab Definitely Maybe \u00bb (1992), consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le plus beau live de l\u2019histoire de la musique de tous les temps, est encens\u00e9 par la presse et atteint la troisi\u00e8me place du classement Billboard 200.\nLa musique d\u2019Oasis peut se d\u00e9finir comme un rock avec des arrangements pop sophistiqu\u00e9s et des textes critiques qui t\u00e9moignent d\u2019une certaine sensibilit\u00e9 au cin\u00e9ma et \u00e0 la culture populaire. C\u2019est ce que d\u00e9montre bien l\u2019introduction de cet album. D\u2019un simple \u00ab Hello \u00bb, on est plong\u00e9 dans ce qui semble \u00eatre une publicit\u00e9 de Coca-Cola, suivie d\u2019un texte qui reprend en gros les paroles d\u2019un c\u00e9l\u00e8bre personnage de la s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00ab Dragnet \u00bb : \u00ab I thought you was a pretty nice guy till you started telling me what to think.

{"prompt":"Humanity filially contacts god to find out his only wish is to die .","text":"Humanity filially contacts god to find out his only wish is to die.So i think i must be a sinner,to not understand those who cant be understandable to us,because of our own sin.\nSo how can i be a sinner?I have a sinful spirit.So if i was not born from that body I would become a sinner.Is there really a human being on earth who doesnt have a sinful spirit? If this has a sinful part in it.\nThe word that appears so often in the scriptures that tells us we have a sinful spirit and the power of sin is that of the word of God..sin,the word used to make one sin..its name is sin,sin is the work of the wicked and he has that power over people.\nWhat is the work of the wicked? sinning,doing things that are forbidden,actions,acts which are done and done by people as sin. Sin is one of the characteristics of the evil spirit.\nSin is a characteristic of the evil spirit..the sin of the flesh and the sin of the lust of the eyes etc.\nSo there is no question as to whether that is what you are a sinner and do not need a doctor to tell you to live.The only thing which is a sin is doing things according to the will of the sinful spirit,and to do those things,to act and behave according to them and by nature being born of that flesh of sin which is the nature of human beings.\nDoing things according to the flesh of man sin has two parts. Sinful acts which the sinful spirit does and sinful acts which people do.\nSinful acts which the sinful spirit does are the acts of the flesh which can never be forgiven and sins in the sins of our nature.Sinful acts which people do include things that are sinful,acts which are done according to the flesh and according to the sinful spirit that is the will of the sinful spirit.\nSo how can we know whether we are to do something,or not?We have a sinful spirit,and a sinful nature to fall in sin. We have to be on guard because whatever we do we must not be sinning but we must guard against it and we must put on the armour of God.\nWe are always in a sin,but as we are born of the spirit and have a sinful nature we must always be able to do or avoid sins in our lives\nSo how many sinful things we do and how much sense there is in us when we say \u2018I\u2019m sinful,I am not sinful\u2019?We are born of a sinful spirit which is our nature.we have a sinful nature. And sin is not all of these sinful things all of the sins of the world but we must never forget that\nsin is something which is not nice,sin is not all of what people do.Sin is something which God hates,but it is also one of the most beautiful things in our lives. Sin is something which causes pain..not only in other people but also in ourselves as the Bible says,\u201dsin is the work of sorrowful hearts.\u201d It always brings sorrow,something that hurts and disappoints us.It never hurts God.","token_len":663,"entropy":[7.4121,13.6445,4.4455,11.2338,8.4752,3.6954,4.906,1.9547,4.2667,8.1101,4.2618,0.5378,0.5699,3.9244,1.0608,9.606,6.4775,3.7541,2.737,5.0757,2.1987,2.8292,5.8987,2.7875,2.0056,8.9518,5.5727,4.864,6.3863,2.5733,7.9672,3.8841,10.1471,2.7279,3.6757,2.1543,3.3078,2.5772,3.5236,3.6893,4.7306,1.5306,3.2024,8.4127,4.5073,1.9983,1.3744,2.7062,0.9618,0.3298,0.0004,1.7484,4.2482,2.8319,2.4666,7.6454,4.395,1.8349,4.0024,2.9505,0.4845,3.5886,3.9987,4.3837,4.4127,3.9741,4.7266,3.5788,0.5367,5.018,0.7064,0.5125,0.0006,0.8507,5.5506,2.213,5.4394,1.3155,6.3895,1.4796,3.9978,1.0218,0.8761,3.3735,2.3259,1.0487,3.0974,0.1999,0.5078,5.2724,4.0881,5.5827,3.7005,4.1459,7.773,3.6944,0.2273,4.2989,1.7089,4.3373,5.6287,4.6619,5.4622,6.7293,1.5809,0.8912,1.3245,3.0959,4.9374,6.0551,0.4287,3.2016,2.338,1.3741,1.4748,0.478,3.6583,3.9311,5.7361,2.05,2.6402,0.7375,2.3781,1.3778,1.4663,4.2186,1.1188,0.3873,5.8647,6.5577,3.5283,3.8291,1.9784,5.7378,1.0465,4.3035,4.4231,2.6806,3.4988,6.5335,6.7253,1.0791,3.3434,2.1792,2.3677,2.9362,1.2272,6.9156,0.2121,1.1253,4.5012,2.4477,5.3829,2.9865,5.7054,1.1906,3.2434,4.3642,1.0296,1.5447,4.4812,1.4269,1.1465,4.9692,0.1118,0.5767,0.4805,1.0002,6.8649,7.0653,2.0526,4.9657,3.1532,1.523,1.0701,4.3316,1.9477,7.8912,2.4843,4.5356,4.5273,0.7476,2.9869,4.0843,3.8228,2.1374,3.2979,5.4234,3.9449,1.6787,6.3277,0.9634,4.8586,0.383,0.5998,7.1169,0.3728,1.1876,3.2958,2.3877,0.9744,1.0975,3.7001,0.624,2.1786,5.5702,0.4002,0.833,1.0299,0.3889,2.7731,2.9607,2.9303,1.095,1.1985,4.513,2.7641,0.9542,0.2193,0.0676,0.1403,7.3526,2.064,1.2727,3.5657,5.9163,1.03,0.9331,2.0582,4.0457,0.5921,1.4825,4.9486,4.4497,0.0371,1.9003,5.0692,1.6358,3.2754,4.1204,0.9824,5.4197,0.096,0.0,3.2453,5.8657,0.8736,3.4841,2.5332,7.8912,1.2832,2.4078,0.0432,2.18,4.3029,2.391,4.4591,2.7451,1.44,4.7559,1.5045,3.1757,1.4859,0.8165,4.547,1.09,6.8813,0.0068,0.844,2.2891,0.0683,0.6335,5.3783,0.7555,2.4363,2.4812,4.1976,1.9397,2.1022,0.1933,3.4191,3.8334,6.1419,3.7583,5.0225,0.5649,0.0056,5.7718,3.4177,5.5829,5.743,6.1894,5.864,1.5887,2.1071,5.2822,4.706,1.2359,3.3653,0.9937,1.3974,6.4951,0.1079,5.1985,0.9797,0.755,0.7107,5.1559,4.7707,1.8543,0.5751,0.0052,0.4159,6.2977,1.0645,7.057,7.0915,5.4216,5.0619,2.3291,1.1918,6.8518,4.4719,1.7483,3.0063,4.0237,2.22,0.4593,1.8099,2.6416,3.589,0.6405,0.2617,5.8784,0.305,1.0853,0.7139,2.6735,0.646,0.4543,1.0842,0.7196,0.8615,0.0654,0.225,3.3175,2.4529,2.9784,0.79,0.5833,3.9038,2.3823,5.3578,4.3332,0.4585,3.2679,2.3949,4.3221,5.3106,1.3389,5.7999,0.6074,3.8046,3.9021,1.2042,5.324,0.4655,0.3063,0.5659,2.9518,0.1566,5.5162,2.805,1.6473,1.0862,3.3919,1.6636,3.0186,0.7303,0.5098,1.5499,2.7402,0.0029,0.2654,4.1929,3.7376,7.637,0.0078,0.402,2.8517,0.2143,4.0465,1.2992,1.1739,5.5246,0.1307,0.2911,0.986,0.1311,0.5379,0.4705,1.5051,3.8203,0.415,2.3892,3.6733,2.258,1.7505,0.3689,7.0668,3.8549,3.0584,4.1563,2.6939,0.6452,1.6498,4.732,2.1497,1.9439,1.984,0.3338,1.8546,1.6319,3.2707,0.8755,4.855,4.4567,5.4711,1.9313,3.7092,0.8929,3.4091,1.4013,3.1711,2.13,5.3652,3.1301,4.4489,7.3148,0.8596,0.2095,2.27,3.4288,3.3229,1.741,3.006,1.7423,5.3388,1.7673,0.6694,6.5314,1.8611,2.5298,2.1564,1.974,0.2266,5.9901,2.5779,1.9697,5.7662,0.6532,3.847,1.4086,0.5578,3.1948,2.1696,5.0447,2.3508,2.1464,2.7498,2.3546,2.6088,4.2306,1.4999,1.6628,3.3892,1.4282,1.462,4.264,2.6418,4.0391,2.2774,0.4772,1.0639,1.1574,2.1639,2.7893,0.9641,4.1804,0.0313,2.336,4.8,4.8489,4.198,2.8862,1.3876,2.1228,4.4861,2.036,2.0489,4.8246,4.5634,2.061,3.2777,1.6086,2.5454,1.7536,2.5696,7.9074,5.5697,0.3662,1.0232,5.3484,3.489,0.1971,2.9151,14.3028,7.7453,3.6506,5.639,7.3718,4.6548,6.0472,1.8814,2.7832,2.4713,1.4496,4.4109,4.3946,1.4488,3.4386,5.0832,1.2286,2.6718,0.6251,2.5129,1.0579,0.822,3.8302,1.4683,3.9668,3.4179,1.7118,6.3164,2.284,1.2586,0.7783,0.3462,2.4402,6.1861,4.3851,0.7799,2.5681,5.6863,1.9998,4.4706,4.6133,0.2756,6.7596,0.152,3.1872,3.6892,2.0005,1.2114,0.6688,4.5106,2.1645,1.4319,4.1055,2.7175,1.0962,5.097,4.0777,0.4618,3.6723,1.5551,1.2974,2.3188,8.7238,1.801,3.4827,0.2353,2.1169,2.1218,0.339,5.5828,3.337,0.6186,1.6275,4.7073,0.3009,1.3116,0.6698,6.5179,2.9279,1.5692,2.7518,2.4543,0.4841,3.4397,5.3058,0.8706,1.0592,3.157,2.794,0.2251,1.0714,3.7065,2.8618,0.762,5.3636,0.3558,1.3244,0.6963,5.5258,2.1847,5.4337,4.373,2.9032,2.6768,6.291,0.3181,0.5476,0.9604,0.1734,1.5447,2.6051,5.7258,6.9186,0.5754,2.4217,7.2422,5.1107,3.5144,0.4438,2.3706,4.2768,0.0587,8.1571,4.43,4.6763,1.3968,4.7537,0.3749,5.1861,7.0117,3.0134,2.791,2.5008,7.5212,1.6502,3.895,2.3576,6.6302,0.0149,0.9945,1.0254,4.1757,5.1645,2.7134,5.3812,2.0807]}
{"prompt":"You amounted to nothing much and eventually die and go to the afterlife . Instead of finding other people , you find all the versions of yourself you could have potentially become .","text":"You amounted to nothing much and eventually die and go to the afterlife. Instead of finding other people, you find all the versions of yourself you could have potentially become. The world has forgotten about you, but you are never forgotten. I am sorry, but it's time to close this door now, to find our way back the way things were before. That would be hard to believe, being as that day was so close to the future.\" She hugged himself and nodded, saying he was right. When she let go of him she felt his gentle kisses on her cheeks.\nHer eyes were wide open and she lay there, with a heavy feeling on her chest. \"I can't believe that you did that, \" she said with a breath in her lungs and a smile on her lips. He slowly walked to her, saying she could come out now. With a step at a time, she walked out, her face still smiling, just like that night in the restaurant when they first started, on that date he said the night before the event. She stopped, staring at the door, the one that had once been open to her. She felt a sudden rush of pain in her stomach as she saw a long-lost dream coming true, and the reality of the world she had chosen to live in. It was like a moment she had never seen before. The world she thought she would be living in when she left the hospital was actually a different world where she ended up living another life. She saw all of the versions of herself she had possibly tried to be and they all made her smile. Her vision was blurred as she was looking around, finding herself on a train heading to the city. She finally noticed something, and was shocked to see so many cars waiting outside the station waiting for her. Then her phone started vibrating outside her pocket, and she noticed her friend was calling her.\nI hope I made sense the new story. I have no idea what to say in this story. I hope you can read all the words I wrote out to the end, after the last few lines I hope you could understand that the characters are still alive, they do not just go away as easy as one day to another. This is actually the next story in the series, I am just writing this story in advance, I hope it helps in the future. If you don't like this story, simply tell me. I think the more I can explain, the better understanding I will gain from the readers.\nThe characters aren't really all there yet. The story should have more pages, but the events are pretty much straight forward and easy to understand. I have decided to make this story short, the main reason is that this story will become a series, I don't want it to get too long.\nI know the story is a little short. But I hope you can enjoy the way these characters develop into a very close family. Their relationships are becoming more of a sibling bond, even though they are at the opposite ends of the world. I haven't done this in any of the stories, but I hope to do this in future. That is why I have decided not to include any love scenes in this story, in the future I may do this in future stories.","token_len":664,"entropy":[12.7162,0.0686,2.2992,6.8763,3.3494,7.0966,8.2156,4.4551,3.5319,1.4613,2.2583,3.9387,0.9621,6.6199,0.9661,5.1732,5.6613,1.4321,1.5645,1.9679,4.1295,5.358,1.3125,9.0832,0.2329,0.8215,2.8318,2.5952,2.8186,9.9733,4.3453,0.8747,3.3745,4.0452,3.4847,6.9372,2.0368,0.1995,1.4143,2.4909,1.1005,2.2857,5.2881,2.3422,0.5987,4.3262,3.1129,4.0137,1.6722,1.2521,2.945,1.5081,3.2568,0.7833,5.6443,1.3908,3.546,4.2614,2.3658,3.4927,3.7774,5.0647,2.9588,0.9212,7.0168,0.4948,6.8134,0.7103,1.3057,1.2431,5.1796,3.902,0.5008,4.9936,2.4017,2.338,1.0141,7.0243,5.7427,5.9567,5.2998,1.7749,4.6074,2.6219,1.1731,2.7302,4.5894,3.2758,4.3722,6.4897,6.433,2.3543,4.0443,2.2226,5.1791,5.3784,1.6531,4.5142,0.3998,5.3033,1.4588,5.4585,0.7036,0.5264,0.4157,2.2248,2.9087,2.0221,6.853,5.6955,0.7746,0.1615,3.3571,1.1592,2.0002,8.2714,2.9394,2.5032,2.1354,1.0189,1.5971,0.5681,7.6184,1.8183,1.5691,4.8684,1.7534,4.9008,2.7984,3.3236,0.0781,1.6876,0.618,2.6414,1.5045,2.8781,0.5047,1.0196,2.6323,1.4354,3.3064,1.3468,2.1563,8.3348,0.8262,1.3108,3.0093,0.1839,4.9544,5.1566,0.1909,3.5964,3.2528,0.7025,2.6053,0.7332,0.0226,1.1625,0.1916,3.4849,5.6719,3.111,2.8372,0.7295,1.8985,5.1076,3.5568,3.1704,4.3047,3.8679,4.26,0.7787,5.4965,0.8217,5.9447,5.4256,3.0974,0.2613,1.2336,1.0023,3.9946,1.7459,2.5663,3.3197,2.7998,3.0993,3.992,1.7931,4.9771,2.1677,2.4905,3.493,4.0307,0.8182,8.017,4.1276,2.2754,2.2698,3.3575,3.1908,6.0363,3.1176,4.3798,4.8489,3.079,4.4074,3.807,0.4918,4.1719,4.3155,0.973,1.9217,5.3113,1.9912,4.0981,0.5444,2.0237,3.207,1.6434,3.7701,5.2664,1.3314,2.028,3.8354,0.9441,2.9855,2.6766,0.5433,1.0286,1.82,3.3699,2.1769,3.5017,2.7865,0.2784,3.293,1.9602,0.057,2.2902,2.7348,0.4907,3.504,3.0442,5.4064,4.499,2.736,4.2638,4.0682,2.0199,1.5561,2.0902,2.6765,6.196,0.7437,2.1881,2.8789,1.949,0.6884,5.2785,0.6373,0.6177,0.2788,0.9065,2.8712,0.6878,3.1415,1.9397,5.029,2.4881,0.511,1.1427,2.3423,0.2702,1.0425,2.7385,2.55,1.6122,4.9595,0.9269,2.1794,2.7285,2.3996,0.1306,5.2322,0.242,3.9184,1.9254,3.0296,2.3658,4.3731,1.4844,4.186,1.3398,5.232,0.6532,7.3755,0.0716,3.5276,6.6435,1.1712,0.8654,1.6583,4.1826,4.1055,1.6662,0.9068,6.7779,0.1268,0.1322,1.0848,1.0592,4.3206,7.1925,0.9073,2.7479,2.1839,3.869,1.0034,3.9809,0.7931,4.2242,1.2695,3.3268,5.0066,1.3885,3.3799,2.5261,0.3104,4.0795,3.8174,3.4766,1.4398,5.6025,3.1273,3.7463,1.3338,6.0291,4.0853,1.895,1.0356,2.4028,1.2463,1.2566,5.4517,4.3453,3.0384,1.7321,1.6789,3.97,3.2453,1.086,0.4101,5.2004,0.1178,4.746,4.2183,2.4507,1.9607,1.9904,4.9373,0.5776,0.0587,0.6531,5.2536,3.8194,5.1247,1.9196,3.0194,0.0009,7.2256,1.9224,5.3744,1.1496,0.9273,0.5786,4.0341,2.8865,4.0474,2.1748,4.3199,1.329,1.898,1.8537,5.3353,4.4431,2.9513,3.8127,4.1166,6.8605,7.7822,3.9864,1.6786,1.7407,3.5602,2.6074,0.311,0.8148,1.9806,1.2538,4.7322,1.6143,1.8246,0.9129,1.3662,2.3421,1.4302,2.5592,3.5915,4.8498,1.2071,3.9731,2.5153,2.112,4.9232,3.6007,3.3864,2.4097,1.8945,6.4606,2.2021,3.7371,2.6635,3.7529,3.2297,3.8974,0.4828,4.434,2.3027,3.3333,2.9815,4.7514,1.7624,3.54,2.0282,1.4639,3.4476,4.3901,0.4517,4.1655,4.1445,2.1867,3.8536,7.3486,0.2506,4.8093,4.9961,5.2496,2.3926,1.04,4.2613,1.0838,6.1595,2.1561,5.4492,1.2652,1.7882,0.7294,0.6302,1.2045,2.1272,2.5176,3.5074,3.616,1.9753,1.8318,3.2526,5.6507,2.1171,1.9524,2.1179,2.4987,2.5346,4.7705,1.5231,1.015,0.5222,3.0834,0.3973,3.8154,0.0012,1.526,2.0637,0.2008,0.6513,7.0602,3.3827,0.294,2.5555,1.15,4.5356,3.3626,4.0454,1.8368,3.7474,5.0184,1.9669,0.1804,0.5529,9.7024,0.9958,1.5091,3.4637,1.7576,2.6538,1.4913,0.593,1.6506,3.2481,4.7056,5.0323,0.0028,3.5141,3.7178,3.6852,0.6828,1.1685,1.9024,2.0203,6.3811,2.3121,3.1257,6.097,1.4951,1.3304,2.8142,6.9995,1.7482,4.3889,1.5089,6.2294,0.4643,2.1042,5.0633,0.2562,1.5284,0.4638,1.5893,3.2187,4.6227,0.4263,2.4707,1.9696,1.3319,3.8204,1.0317,4.4749,2.2491,4.8693,1.9928,1.7035,3.2371,1.0493,2.2482,5.6675,1.9741,3.703,1.7787,2.3466,2.8279,0.0013,0.6186,2.2429,0.0587,3.3694,1.3504,0.9177,1.0452,2.7893,2.004,3.8296,3.0575,1.4793,1.0791,2.3723,1.3895,2.3021,2.6867,3.008,1.1491,2.1611,0.9352,2.1234,1.8764,2.5377,5.3489,5.3319,0.5924,4.4701,4.1778,2.7191,4.5749,6.2858,3.1255,0.7269,5.6826,4.1894,1.4403,6.8965,0.8053,5.8521,0.3223,7.563,4.7923,1.0823,4.1202,1.2687,1.0927,1.2477,5.257,1.4732,4.4693,1.5567,0.0194,0.3307,2.3646,0.5227,1.8256,6.9245,0.001,3.2398,2.1764,2.6784,3.2422,1.796,0.526,1.9823,1.7416,1.2406,0.7121,1.3884,3.0989,0.7723,1.869,1.0026,2.7654,1.2438,5.5293,1.6506,1.3616,0.3024,2.4101,1.0485,3.6708,0.0027,3.0776,1.94,7.5234,2.2245,1.9818,0.6403,0.1268,1.3074,4.4638,2.1666,1.6783,1.2997,4.3012,2.7018,2.7019,1.7315,2.3307,1.2833,0.6855]}
{"prompt":"Every 2000 years a Lottery is drawn in the Universe . Earth has been drawn three times in a row .","text":"Every 2000 years a Lottery is drawn in the Universe. Earth has been drawn three times in a row. You can try to bet on a Lottery by buying a ticket. This ticket pays an additional $ 100 million if your name is drawn. No purchase needed. The other two tickets ( $ 1 million ) should be kept until the next drawing. If your name is drawn, your ticket will pay $ 1 million.\nWe cannot control which we are drawn and neither can the other person. This can only be done by accident, luck or divine intervention. To be fair to the other person, he must not know that you already bought that ticket and you may have not seen the other ones that pay more.\n2. To put in money on the right team to win the Super Bowl. You have to know which team will win. You know it is impossible to predict that with absolute certainty. But to make the money you should bet on the team that you think will win. The sports betting company will give you a bonus for your prediction.\nFor example : you have a team, which is going to win the match ( by a certain goal ). So you bet $ 100 :\n- If the team wins the game but the team does so after going down to 10, you lose your money ( 100 $, plus $ 0.33 ) ;\n- If the team wins the match by more then 10 goals you win more money ( 100 $ more plus $ 33 more ). If you win $ 300 :\nYou will always lose more money if you bet wrongly. Also for the games where there is a tie a player can play again the week after. So it may be easy to guess one or two outcomes, but with 3 different outcomes this becomes way harder\nYou have to know in advance when a match will start, who will be the players that are going to play and if there will be a break. You have to make a list of what you must know.\nFor example : the match starts at 10. Team A wins by 1 goal. You need to know if it was a mistake, a goal by mistake or a goal that counts.\nYou have to find the odds. You know that for example for a match between X and Y in a city Z you have to pay 3 for 1. You want to bet $ 1 in order to win $ 3 :\n- If the match is cancelled by one of the two teams ( the one that is not going to play ) you lose your money ;\n- if the match is cancelled by the organisers, you won\u2019t win your money because the match would not have started.\nIt is important to remember that you have to buy the tickets well in advance. All the sports betting companies have different discounts and bonuses on their online sites.\n3. Putting money to win the lottery. This is possible only if you want to win the lottery and you have a chance to win the lottery :\n4. Betting that this company will buy this stock. The stock must be bought before the purchase is made. All you have to do is go on the website of the company that sells the stock and buy it.

{"prompt":"The Quiet Zone in the US is strictly and brutally enforced . One day you discover that it 's not about a radio telescope .","text":"The Quiet Zone in the US is strictly and brutally enforced. One day you discover that it's not about a radio telescope. It's about a radio frequency jammer. What is important to know - is that the RF jammer is not designed to prevent you from receiving a signal, but to stop or prevent the transmission of a signal. The signal received does not go anywhere, because it's sent from another frequency. In the US jamming signals are illegal.\nOf course, because people are interested in receiving radio signals, the situation is more complex. First of all, it should also be noted that today there exist very reliable devices - such as the QIYUN FM jammers and QIYUN GPS jammers. But when designing this kind of radio device for the general public, the developers of these devices took into account not only the effectiveness of jamming but also to a degree the comfort of use and the aesthetic appearance.\nQIYUN Radio Jammer has a special design. It uses radio frequencies of the frequencies of GSM mobile phones. It seems that the reception of radio waves of these frequencies by the antenna is very easy. Yes, but in the real world such a device is very difficult. The signals from the mobile phone station and from the jammers are mixed not only at the receiving antenna but also (at least theoretically) at the sending antenna.\nIf at the sending antenna we talk about a regular antenna, it is possible that the electromagnetic wave from the radio station will have a little bit of \"additional\" power. But the more usual method involves the use of an antenna switch - a device capable of \"passing to the antenna\" the electromagnetic wave sent from the radio station, but at the same time preventing it from reaching the antenna.\nWith this radio frequency jammer, you can receive not only the signals of a specific frequency but from a number of different wireless bands.\nRadio jammers are devices which work at the frequencies of mobile phone networks (GSM, GPRS and 3G) and on the frequencies of GPS satellites. They are mainly used by criminals.\nRadio Jammers are also used for protection against electromagnetic emissions on the frequencies of GSM cells and on various networks of public safety.\nRadio Frequency Jammers are based on the principle of receiving radio waves in the frequency range of interest and turning or reflecting it (depending on the type of the device) in the wanted direction or converting it into energy that can be stored (e.g. a battery). In this case, the antenna is separated into two parts: a transmitting section, which sends the radio waves into the air or reflection from obstacles, and a receiving section, which detects the signals. Usually there are two antennas: one transmitting and one receiving.\nThe most common type of antenna is a monopole. The length should be optimized in order to receive as much information as possible (see our post on the optimal length of a monopole antenna).\nIt is not always so. For example, a dipole does not transmit the same information. But as an alternative, you can choose to use the antenna with two antennas - a transmitting and receiving one. This will let you focus your attention on a more precise area of the spectrum and receive more information.","token_len":665,"entropy":[12.1319,6.8646,4.2717,1.9783,4.999,3.1591,8.5436,6.9533,5.8094,1.6655,1.1902,5.3268,3.4889,2.908,6.0795,1.1173,3.8383,0.6708,2.1425,4.5973,4.6203,7.8067,5.7709,2.5126,0.5292,0.1024,0.2305,1.5884,5.3006,5.3497,6.2124,2.1292,0.9734,5.0379,2.3327,5.8978,1.5835,1.6193,6.9779,2.317,1.1433,1.7854,6.5963,2.4756,0.1204,0.9132,2.1755,3.6034,0.3026,4.9959,2.838,0.0518,3.7416,2.2591,1.3957,2.4289,1.4159,0.7771,3.5933,5.3356,3.059,1.922,3.0708,0.244,1.7653,1.1672,0.8068,2.0193,4.6867,6.2046,4.2228,0.1286,3.5643,4.1075,1.4327,3.822,1.1319,1.8413,4.5493,2.363,4.4683,4.0243,0.7454,3.3191,2.1591,1.4575,6.6586,1.1197,4.7918,0.765,6.0157,0.9271,2.2569,10.3321,0.077,0.4605,5.3283,5.313,1.7968,6.0827,0.0965,5.9099,2.5583,1.033,0.6397,2.4036,5.7414,0.9467,3.6671,1.8325,0.5439,5.1835,1.3022,0.002,0.0996,2.6236,5.8564,4.8995,0.102,0.6291,0.05,7.7526,2.533,6.9056,4.0307,6.2574,5.4426,4.1998,2.0431,0.003,1.6054,6.1088,5.58,5.5605,6.6249,6.8205,6.8807,0.0268,2.4852,3.4892,0.6321,0.1009,0.1141,5.6769,1.3961,0.0006,0.9849,2.9862,4.6816,7.7295,4.229,3.5109,0.0017,3.8108,4.882,4.2833,1.6828,6.2628,0.5684,0.357,2.169,5.488,1.6447,1.3686,0.6753,5.9139,1.5517,0.3382,4.6519,0.2064,0.4705,7.5362,0.1081,3.0513,0.153,2.6921,0.1182,5.4835,4.4732,3.9856,1.6621,7.9799,1.264,4.9745,2.9377,1.1512,8.0207,5.9253,1.7439,1.3637,2.6769,0.2334,0.0082,0.0073,5.2951,1.7318,0.3178,5.966,1.5848,4.2562,3.5335,2.3644,1.1521,3.0255,4.8555,2.9878,3.3837,2.2212,4.9805,1.7035,7.9892,1.7261,7.3339,1.627,1.2169,1.4362,6.4862,0.8821,1.5505,6.9404,0.6938,2.6549,1.6557,3.4019,4.1862,0.6026,4.704,1.1117,5.3466,1.5389,1.7705,3.6386,0.9734,7.5313,0.1228,5.9253,3.8225,1.7955,2.9871,0.0461,5.3949,1.9511,1.5582,1.2326,2.1063,1.2509,1.4751,2.1506,6.5653,2.8945,1.2956,3.9978,0.754,7.3606,3.8655,2.2818,0.6342,4.6237,0.0094,1.1608,5.8472,7.2295,0.187,4.4851,1.0041,5.3772,3.1325,0.6872,0.3137,7.5835,3.3474,2.1865,5.6106,0.0658,0.9581,0.2044,5.3038,0.9144,0.4487,1.9625,4.3938,6.9227,1.4268,2.8161,0.5174,4.9649,5.9616,0.4668,1.8816,6.16,5.4252,0.834,2.3966,1.3939,2.5965,0.8491,1.2803,6.47,2.9713,3.2185,0.4291,2.9236,3.4257,2.2044,3.9057,1.2356,5.5827,1.5751,0.2697,5.493,8.5249,1.7448,1.3102,3.6467,0.961,2.1866,2.2559,4.2236,7.4448,5.3271,6.0438,2.158,1.6741,0.0043,3.0947,1.9591,6.4618,3.0636,1.9879,3.4962,5.563,0.0213,5.0105,5.6471,0.1905,6.7596,1.517,4.5592,1.0928,5.1486,3.6037,0.996,4.8963,1.2167,0.2194,1.7467,0.2356,3.0058,3.42,3.6715,0.7054,2.4788,0.0132,5.7606,2.6018,0.1149,2.417,0.2738,3.6368,0.4241,1.3713,4.8075,1.8423,4.5766,4.9292,0.2535,0.082,0.6309,2.487,0.7882,2.8148,6.9232,0.0681,1.6813,2.2938,1.4946,2.457,3.8439,0.6575,1.0144,5.0724,2.1296,3.4584,0.0381,1.1855,7.0499,4.2391,0.7126,2.4068,4.2587,4.8751,0.0041,1.1944,6.738,1.8755,4.5756,3.6137,1.7088,4.3615,0.4729,3.7591,1.5729,3.6669,3.3547,2.666,0.013,1.0239,2.5527,2.1282,0.0092,2.1926,5.1862,0.0558,1.6618,0.9426,4.381,1.2758,4.2874,0.1759,4.3359,3.6809,0.959,1.61,1.0492,5.1536,0.4914,2.3292,5.2665,1.9672,1.8076,3.3646,3.9757,0.0045,1.1949,2.0486,1.1057,2.0715,6.91,0.9791,4.0809,5.9722,5.1865,1.1865,4.1342,0.2526,4.5643,0.0849,6.9625,1.5534,2.0664,5.0232,5.111,1.6485,5.6132,6.6244,2.5493,0.8827,2.5893,6.4089,2.0633,0.003,1.1741,5.7662,0.1145,1.0204,2.4448,0.5382,7.5308,3.3048,0.8595,2.8573,1.5727,3.3829,0.8208,0.7119,11.1974,3.3184,7.6547,7.6772,6.3414,4.7486,4.3713,5.7886,0.0816,0.3387,2.9719,0.213,3.744,3.8667,1.2705,2.1796,1.7043,12.0606,0.9545,4.5337,9.0022,0.4265,0.9052,4.77,4.9599,1.0444,0.1345,2.9633,3.4279,3.2706,0.0024,0.0004,0.3953,3.8623,3.7744,1.3195,3.2329,1.9874,2.0545,0.6038,0.8291,4.8649,1.4811,6.9542,3.0041,0.7933,1.024,1.7265,2.0169,5.4792,4.5226,2.3897,1.0838,4.6149,0.8966,1.8982,1.1221,3.7289,0.4245,5.7538,4.1408,10.1941,3.8614,10.0657,1.1921,0.2893,0.4753,0.7721,0.024,0.466,0.0565,5.9589,0.706,2.6002,2.0716,7.0671,3.7616,0.6302,1.2309,2.4437,2.8619,0.5257,2.597,1.9125,0.142,0.0892,0.4778,0.8583,1.8271,5.3796,0.9412,1.4607,0.1159,3.9734,1.0502,1.7325,6.3589,0.2711,1.5752,2.0093,7.534,8.0667,0.2536,9.3701,3.3867,1.0774,0.1053,4.0167,4.3916,0.6442,3.4398,0.2874,0.0204,3.3274,3.895,4.8874,4.3552,1.3045,1.6003,6.7228,2.4463,1.2037,1.0251,1.0155,0.0039,1.3132,0.951,1.3443,4.2663,0.6999,3.1328,3.8063,5.8972,2.4864,2.9212,0.3675,0.2373,2.403,5.9245,0.0028,6.5273,0.0855,2.4292,2.0596,3.149,1.1433,3.4085,2.7414,4.5684,3.688,2.2856,0.6013,2.8863,0.4701,3.7125,1.6391,1.8173,3.1123,2.5249,2.3193,3.1709,1.2345,3.8289,2.4213,4.071,1.7126,3.7434,4.0132,0.2176,3.3635,3.0615,5.0366,0.1901,5.7937,2.0841,0.7792,0.5671,3.0517,4.5928,4.1048,4.4896,1.5733,0.4694,4.0416,2.5323,5.6753,1.1661,0.3888,0.6483]}
{"prompt":"Create a story where the characters live in a world where something is fundementally different with reality and leave the reader to guess what it is . For example : entropy is reversed , gravity goes sideways , all people can read minds , etc .","text":"Create a story where the characters live in a world where something is fundementally different with reality and leave the reader to guess what it is. For example : entropy is reversed, gravity goes sideways, all people can read minds, etc. I do not mean you to describe your story here but to show what ideas you are thinking of, so the story can evolve as you wish.\n\" I try to give my characters their powers as they come from stories such as The Chronicles of Narnia. I hope to have a world where all possible powers can exist in the long run.\"\nSounds like you want to give the characters their own \"owners\" for the powers they are capable of? If so, this isn't one of the categories where most people will go, but I'll go ahead & give it a shot, just in case it's what you were thinking. The one thing I like about this idea is that, the \"owners\" aren't restricted to being human. Though a lot of things will have to change to make this idea work. In general, I avoid stories like, \"How does John Smith become Superman?\" because that's a kind of trap. It's not the character's inability to change things, it's about allowing the character to change things, using abilities they've learned to do.\nTo come to some example, if one could learn to swim by using a shark tank, or become invincible by drinking a special liquid, or become invisible by putting the hood over a car, well, those abilities may be useful and be something that would be useful in a series like this. One thing that I am not sure about (and I could be wrong here) is if the characters themselves would like to wear the hood over the car. Is the car of one more powerful and desirable, or is it more dangerous?\nIn general, I think the ability to learn a new ability would depend more on the character themselves, than on what they become, but with something like this, it's not as easy to say. You could put, \"Only a really good teacher can teach someone to fly, so only very good trainers can teach characters in this genre to fly.\" But if a teacher is an assassin, then maybe that doesn't make sense; because the assassin would like to learn, and then will use them to kill others. I think if a character can learn to do a skill, it could just be something that is useful, but maybe not something that the individual feels it is their responsibility to do.\nThe same thing can be applied to the abilities that characters have. There can be things that are useful for one character, but not the others. I often tell writers that they shouldn't make all the characters in a story the same, but that sometimes, making the main character a jerk is the only choice that they have, instead of making him nice, or making him less capable. To be honest, that's easier said than done and probably the easiest thing I could do. If a character is really evil, if they commit crimes, they're not the kind of character I would want to follow, but it's still necessary to see that he could be happy, he could have a life, he could get killed, but he could be happy.","token_len":665,"entropy":[3.3606,7.8555,4.9393,2.5199,3.8538,3.656,1.1916,1.1185,1.3306,1.0507,6.7713,1.75,16.8193,5.6928,0.5421,2.4964,6.2996,7.2946,2.3816,8.9966,2.2713,3.3667,1.8201,3.0495,1.0782,2.2038,0.545,0.6523,5.0794,1.3294,7.8181,14.0036,1.5082,7.7988,1.9267,6.5815,5.7916,4.7761,0.5636,4.8722,6.3878,4.5211,5.1075,7.0699,1.5298,3.7485,0.2437,3.9544,4.4143,0.5768,2.7461,6.0575,6.2116,6.4905,4.3726,2.9632,4.39,2.3889,3.2992,3.2719,3.093,7.2453,1.518,2.9863,3.6346,1.7437,2.3503,3.7787,3.9545,3.881,2.2757,5.3661,2.9279,0.6817,3.203,0.5287,1.8314,7.3123,4.8572,5.2768,0.4675,4.0303,3.0598,2.1574,4.6459,6.9344,3.2206,1.9122,3.802,2.9234,7.2564,4.802,0.0054,3.0612,5.143,0.2286,0.4134,0.0519,0.0011,1.9304,2.068,3.1927,2.7794,3.3509,2.0143,4.3448,0.5045,3.2269,6.5104,3.2523,1.9021,3.3776,2.7206,1.9509,7.9482,0.381,4.3874,0.8413,8.9717,1.4421,2.6974,2.8287,0.52,3.161,2.2042,1.2181,1.3931,3.1029,5.1451,9.672,4.4894,4.3385,1.8831,4.4155,1.0461,3.5866,3.4443,0.0196,3.3715,3.97,1.2442,0.4705,5.0549,4.1307,0.0012,5.082,0.7553,1.6771,8.583,3.2,6.2382,1.6253,2.9006,3.9452,2.7526,0.8635,1.9384,3.7603,3.9029,2.9792,6.9446,2.2125,1.7161,0.3473,1.3823,3.221,3.4129,1.9077,0.0087,3.1788,1.9241,5.6615,0.4247,3.6942,1.7491,0.9841,4.0054,5.2797,0.964,0.7124,3.8754,0.7853,1.3998,3.836,0.3541,0.4298,4.3914,4.9812,4.4353,2.6788,0.1037,4.0154,0.0006,5.7281,0.44,3.8775,4.0795,2.1416,6.643,4.6067,1.3975,0.1376,4.2805,3.731,3.2292,1.46,1.6088,2.0555,1.3942,2.4005,4.5213,0.8841,1.3094,4.0266,4.032,0.4924,1.4489,8.042,4.8491,3.7034,5.663,0.6574,4.4129,3.4909,7.8852,5.228,5.2106,4.7436,1.0502,2.1232,2.2358,1.0723,2.2339,5.2264,0.006,6.2599,1.7733,2.9203,0.6001,2.0221,3.1837,5.0538,2.0,8.4886,0.0522,3.6821,3.3293,1.9465,0.6211,0.0365,5.7364,6.2213,1.4961,2.7419,0.2506,1.9577,1.0495,2.1382,6.5789,6.3902,3.1996,2.6896,2.5847,2.0337,2.6288,1.9949,1.4695,5.2418,6.1575,2.5453,3.7433,8.8936,2.1089,3.3745,4.3809,5.8007,4.979,1.0968,4.4723,2.9006,2.6139,1.3069,5.5107,5.6136,0.6781,3.2389,5.9288,7.5635,0.9422,4.7575,1.7758,5.6257,3.1274,0.9827,2.5882,2.7099,4.2385,0.5739,5.8619,3.9271,6.8379,1.8971,2.6296,3.943,0.7522,6.1077,0.6236,4.0263,4.7555,5.2995,1.1919,2.8738,4.1505,5.7298,4.9251,1.5049,3.0894,0.9015,1.5942,1.7556,1.4578,5.5863,2.5005,1.3106,0.5296,4.9808,2.6449,1.345,1.4907,4.0944,1.4099,1.5662,1.1345,4.4068,1.9656,1.0844,5.0855,2.1201,0.2083,3.5828,1.1688,0.1448,2.2165,2.2886,1.794,4.0887,2.4781,4.9113,0.5637,5.5797,2.8664,1.3697,2.1342,2.0113,0.4781,1.349,4.9382,3.1066,3.4689,5.8565,5.1882,6.3209,5.0111,4.1798,6.3305,3.3796,0.7992,1.493,0.7183,3.1464,4.5085,1.3381,1.8563,3.8215,3.1407,0.1906,1.1071,2.1034,2.1222,4.5295,0.2404,3.8791,3.365,1.4492,2.1732,3.106,5.0227,4.1889,0.1067,0.879,1.0459,5.8276,1.7697,2.9373,0.8496,2.3972,1.5654,6.981,3.1055,1.8825,5.2331,5.0,0.8035,1.3636,0.8359,1.7548,1.7048,2.1845,2.812,3.6297,1.4256,2.2147,2.2582,4.3409,1.8821,5.2121,6.5535,0.9485,7.8879,2.5454,6.927,1.7944,4.5599,0.9319,1.0638,4.826,2.4754,4.4096,1.5381,2.9585,3.3325,7.1058,0.6816,5.9967,0.3575,0.8662,7.5033,5.8336,3.5062,5.5772,1.7073,0.6583,0.7194,2.2943,2.3495,3.2074,4.9753,1.644,3.9739,6.2291,0.5669,1.754,3.8671,2.1101,3.8939,0.0003,1.7976,0.3462,5.4925,5.4323,2.4304,1.2593,2.2998,4.6051,0.1903,2.9606,3.5592,1.5878,4.1207,5.5241,3.6836,4.8073,1.1641,1.8312,3.0618,0.8181,2.6623,1.5462,3.3572,1.9139,1.1978,2.8641,0.7263,1.0723,3.9799,2.9455,4.2567,1.4325,2.2921,2.8234,4.7311,0.4228,3.7327,0.8468,2.3685,2.6163,1.6266,1.8987,4.9248,1.1146,3.028,0.4081,3.3208,5.837,5.5373,4.5231,2.2169,6.6945,2.5992,0.1846,1.2807,0.319,1.0378,3.1625,4.3042,1.4823,2.2737,0.6588,4.4983,0.1352,2.1388,3.7733,2.2454,3.923,1.2795,0.9243,4.0747,4.3254,0.1628,2.8481,0.7111,2.1548,2.9039,1.9211,3.1168,1.5297,0.7978,1.1418,1.5466,3.5768,2.7544,0.5333,2.4107,6.0719,4.7582,4.2326,0.9301,2.0924,3.7711,0.0002,3.742,4.6378,1.2198,1.456,3.112,0.9229,1.0917,3.8216,0.4729,0.9295,2.0269,2.1077,5.0937,2.8613,6.5382,2.0418,4.6563,0.5598,3.0337,6.2035,1.8996,2.3751,2.0521,5.5969,2.3339,2.0809,0.7816,2.0807,6.6222,0.1345,2.0679,3.0674,7.4619,1.9292,2.0374,2.7251,0.218,5.8426,5.3265,0.846,4.9646,2.4577,1.5217,0.0946,3.172,0.759,6.6658,0.1441,0.0211,0.0006,4.3626,3.574,4.0331,3.5501,1.1692,2.4511,1.9619,0.7797,1.1487,3.4445,2.3989,0.2864,1.6647,3.9012,4.1304,0.4717,4.8017,0.8282,6.7608,1.9893,1.0938,2.1419,2.6649,2.1367,2.607,2.9741,0.0829,1.2115,1.3385,2.0661,0.407,0.6623,5.5556,1.9349,1.3313,2.9232,0.8713,3.0332,6.2541,0.7831,4.9211,2.4622,3.1487,5.3456,1.1833,6.8686,1.9058,4.801,0.7094,2.9073,1.1239,3.8923,1.0694,1.2805,0.148,3.819,5.8855,0.6712,2.7521,1.4281,2.0435,2.4144,1.9855,1.537]}

Companies have begun to turn their focus to the commercial Internet of Things (IoT). This market is growing at an amazingly quick pace, and experts predict that this sector will reach its peak with $12B in revenue by 2020. At the same time, the number of IoT devices connected to the global IoT system is rising at a faster pace. As of June 2016, more than 40 billion devices were connected to the Internet, and the number is only expected to grow in the future. As a result of these factors, security concerns within the IoT have reached a heightened level. If you\u2019re working with data, you can be sure that someone is trying to access it, so there should be an extra layer of security. To prevent such attacks and protect your business IoT investments, we must understand the risks involved with security in IoT. These risks include attacks from cyber criminals, physical attacks from your devices and other factors that can lead to data breaches.\nThere are a few different types of IoT security threats. Some of the more commonly heard types include phishing, malware and network attacks. When working with data, we all have to deal with the possibility of the security of personal information becoming compromised. As such, it is important to be extremely vigilant in your approach to security.\nA major issue with IoT is the fact that there is a lot of potential for data misuse. If you have devices that are connected through the Internet, data can be hacked without any action on your part. This is not very surprising, since there are numerous issues with securing information. As mentioned in our previous article on data security, many companies have lost a lot of reputation due to data breaches. A single data breach can be devastating, since your reputation is at stake when you share personal information with someone.\nPhishing is another problem that you need to be especially careful about. This often happens when people try to access devices that they are connected to without knowledge of the user. It can be anything from a social engineering attack to an attempt to steal money, and it is one of the most common types of attack that is being perpetrated against IoT devices. Phishing has the potential to cause an IoT system to completely stop functioning. Some of the problems that can be caused by phishing include data theft and ransomware.","token_len":665,"entropy":[5.3684,6.1888,3.4757,6.0826,0.4676,1.7227,5.4611,1.5867,4.7461,3.6715,1.7087,0.3176,5.5888,1.458,3.349,0.8656,3.892,7.2132,6.4672,1.3818,3.7761,1.9056,0.8289,1.2658,0.5179,1.797,3.0673,1.9791,2.722,1.8517,1.5434,2.9564,0.7087,0.2317,1.6187,4.5402,0.5713,4.3847,1.8859,3.7238,1.5247,2.4761,2.5502,0.3943,4.7475,0.564,2.7306,0.4382,0.8997,3.9317,3.6063,0.1659,2.5627,5.6546,1.9992,0.598,4.9545,3.803,1.476,2.9934,0.1017,2.2083,4.7816,6.556,2.3084,7.6788,4.1667,1.8504,0.8365,1.6065,3.8355,0.0018,3.6992,1.5207,1.8706,3.1092,7.0884,3.1415,0.5872,0.6894,0.7011,5.9068,0.689,3.2891,4.7249,2.1471,3.559,2.7795,3.8834,11.7045,0.2911,3.7094,2.668,0.9131,4.9591,0.7007,6.1513,2.079,1.4072,6.6546,3.1013,2.8577,1.1838,4.5559,0.0015,1.1905,0.1289,3.0477,1.6782,0.6078,0.3016,0.877,4.2842,5.5832,0.8359,4.6317,0.386,8.3577,0.7443,1.3673,4.6046,3.3299,1.0969,3.9574,3.0736,2.1994,2.3124,0.7219,2.8222,5.3867,2.5989,2.9921,0.554,3.3696,3.4295,0.9673,3.4549,0.3484,1.9823,0.1412,1.1079,1.5514,2.8941,1.1292,4.6068,1.6997,10.3064,6.3518,4.4159,6.2769,4.1552,2.8497,2.0265,6.3803,2.6701,1.9603,3.1657,7.5811,2.5061,6.9526,8.51,0.8535,2.6796,3.0289,0.5022,4.8061,3.2149,4.5032,2.9376,1.0444,1.507,2.7287,2.3301,4.0451,4.7339,1.9313,0.8642,2.3274,0.2841,1.1089,1.4813,4.6347,1.2052,4.084,2.3914,1.5916,1.4007,2.3063,0.4348,2.7841,1.3701,5.3242,4.1543,0.2964,1.1962,4.5171,0.0355,2.8048,3.841,4.0944,0.1045,1.1541,6.3181,2.5075,3.1996,0.5608,6.1118,1.3892,5.1142,0.9273,1.58,8.764,4.5429,0.6861,0.012,2.0284,0.1096,0.0103,0.0025,0.7103,2.1918,5.6014,0.7015,1.8625,2.0305,1.1628,5.9591,5.2106,0.6687,2.7248,1.2082,8.5662,3.9817,0.4242,3.042,5.8079,0.2871,3.4195,2.8449,1.7686,4.8633,6.3337,4.6899,3.6773,1.0486,2.4016,1.1505,1.0925,0.1418,5.321,0.8102,0.336,0.0036,0.1129,1.9218,2.8221,0.0165,1.0621,0.7798,4.8481,0.1961,0.2541,5.44,5.0704,5.8494,1.3528,4.2949,1.4767,1.2868,2.9214,1.0287,1.1833,3.8402,2.8034,3.0517,2.1561,0.0996,3.3355,0.1173,3.7839,2.9941,1.7762,1.4479,0.0717,0.2203,0.1534,1.1512,2.9942,1.3529,2.3068,1.3471,2.6151,6.0666,2.535,0.0028,0.8857,3.5176,0.5406,1.7657,0.2019,3.7918,2.1994,0.4296,1.5124,1.9891,5.4434,0.0832,7.9959,5.0884,6.5987,0.5636,0.3617,3.7767,4.3643,0.9927,7.2847,0.2672,0.6187,4.9539,0.7458,19.286,7.4586,3.5375,5.5154,1.1168,6.4416,2.4156,1.904,2.3766,2.7871,1.9727,0.26,5.7848,1.545,2.9833,0.0158,3.1467,4.2304,2.7487,3.134,4.3972,3.4865,0.1282,3.4918,4.9342,1.7029,0.1671,0.3855,1.6643,4.9956,3.2468,3.3156,1.3078,3.9151,1.7985,0.5117,3.7524,8.7217,5.9322,1.0297,1.8814,5.0155,4.3306,0.8912,2.689,2.4131,2.4305,4.6217,2.5188,1.7809,0.789,5.054,1.2386,0.7539,5.8788,3.1645,4.5027,1.0312,0.5393,6.9785,1.82,2.331,6.0566,4.8628,1.946,2.7009,4.1519,1.8434,1.6232,3.1669,0.0528,4.1671,2.3447,0.6431,1.2974,3.6588,0.4786,2.1741,1.5308,3.1473,1.2768,0.0065,1.2049,3.3871,2.9084,1.3369,2.9517,1.3906,1.3309,2.5319,4.2884,5.5328,2.6947,1.6272,5.3533,0.0039,0.8643,2.3726,1.5863,5.3957,1.6249,0.1973,5.1479,4.7392,0.1656,2.5874,0.6291,2.9519,4.4759,1.71,1.1514,3.6059,0.0086,1.5981,2.2519,0.3362,4.2737,4.2696,1.1545,5.2914,1.1244,6.8863,0.827,0.5344,3.5707,3.1636,0.0877,2.0741,0.3443,0.6511,0.3464,3.176,5.3089,0.8285,1.8706,2.4628,6.0691,0.6529,1.4458,0.4246,1.6067,4.179,4.5852,2.8886,1.2609,2.6003,2.4777,1.4536,2.5716,0.0187,2.475,1.073,1.4869,2.339,0.0729,4.6021,0.7252,3.0555,7.0049,0.6089,3.3322,0.5721,1.7617,6.3339,1.11,1.2033,1.5101,5.0319,2.0927,0.3762,0.7289,6.1017,2.2093,0.5589,4.5665,4.5391,2.0811,5.786,4.2828,0.3093,0.0083,0.1822,1.8837,1.1801,2.7154,4.9471,4.5911,1.6899,2.1085,2.4545,0.5831,4.3352,5.6704,0.9758,5.9683,5.4555,1.5236,3.5358,3.6035,2.6191,2.7731,1.0553,1.1035,2.7725,3.2018,0.9944,0.1668,3.8344,2.5105,1.6553,5.518,4.368,0.7896,0.0106,7.2325,1.5037,0.0037,1.0809,0.6855,0.407,4.4313,5.3803,2.8719,0.0903,0.7113,2.8249,2.6125,2.0202,4.1407,3.8744,5.1574,1.9921,2.2067,0.6294,5.336,0.9742,4.4233,3.5151,0.2892,0.6811,2.4629,1.3097,1.8039,7.9249,0.0091,1.2616,1.8142,3.3416,1.0979,3.4199,3.2176,0.0165,1.7767,5.5335,1.4428,1.2235,0.4839,2.6391,6.0711,1.3074,0.861,3.0834,2.3178,0.0139,2.8467,6.1045,1.9934,2.9897,2.2698,1.4649,0.1528,4.5189,6.422,1.002,1.0415,4.0379,1.4917,3.2048,1.267,1.0505,6.6489,0.1912,1.7689,5.1152,3.8768,1.5115,0.706,2.2049,3.0621,0.0965,1.7866,4.5239,2.9868,2.501,1.9332,1.9911,5.1215,0.5085,0.0349,0.8255,0.5,2.0695,0.0497,4.2909,1.5589,2.5174,2.7884,3.3293,2.5417,1.8718,0.8862,0.1159,3.8794,0.0114,4.0988,3.3651,0.1751,0.0929,2.0165,4.0655,3.332,3.6974,0.1325,6.0025,5.3079,2.0101,1.0483,5.4746,1.1167,0.1395,4.6598,1.4701,2.0268,1.4689,1.1245,0.334,0.4091,0.0013,1.0558,4.4038,1.9515,2.1498,5.5114,0.5488]}
{"prompt":"the world is in danger , and your fourth grade recorder skills are now required to save it","text":"the world is in danger, and your fourth grade recorder skills are now required to save it. So what do you do? In the tradition of Rube Goldberg, you think of clever ways of rearranging things so that your \"piece\" becomes an entire machine. One such solution to the problem is your brain, and that's what I'm going to suggest you do today.\nWhat are your brain\u2019s muscles and how do you use them? Your brain is composed of two hemispheres called cerebral lobes and they make up around 90% of the structure of the brain. Most are thought to work independently to process data, but sometimes they communicate with each other to do even more wonderful things. If you can focus your attention on one of these lobes, then you are using a limbic lobe. Using the limbic area as an analogy, imagine your limbic area as being a muscle.\nThe limbic or limbic systems play a role in many different functions such as regulating emotions, mood, memory and behavior, learning and behavior, and regulation of circadian rhythm. The three main branches of the limbic system are: The amygdala or emotion centers, the striatum (which is the part for motivation) and the hypothalamus. In order to get the full picture of how we use our brain, first let us start with one of the many functions that the limbic area is involved in: the emotions.\nThe limbic system is involved in the expression emotion and in our response to emotional stimuli. The limbic system may also affect the way individuals think and act. It is involved in both the process of learning and the way people react to learning. It can also help us make decisions and make us act on our decision. The limbic system deals with how we experience our surroundings and learn from them.\nThe limbic areas of the brain are the nuclei of emotion, feeling, sensation, and consciousness. But what are the nuclei? The nuclei are made up of millions of neurons and they are basically the neurons that are responsible for forming and releasing certain chemicals known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that enable us to send electrical impulses through the brain.\nNeurotransmitters are released when we think and act. They help guide our thoughts and behaviors, giving us guidance to accomplish certain tasks. They also act as a link between brain cells, making it easy to send short messages from one place to another. Because there are different neurotransmitters in the body, it is possible to use these as signals by sending them between different parts of the brain.\nAt the same time, you do more than think and communicate verbally. You have an unconscious brain called the limbic area of the brain that controls many of our thoughts and emotions. When a threat has come to you, you are in a state of heightened alert. To keep this in perspective, you have to think very carefully to find all the reasons why you reacted in one way. The more you think about it when you are experiencing something, the more you get the answers you need. So it is all in your mind. Your brain is just like a watch.

Many people are unsure of the specific meanings of the different strokes and strokes.","token_len":667,"entropy":[8.7546,5.34,5.3673,1.6437,0.8783,7.4367,2.3313,5.5929,4.7348,5.5406,9.2151,10.2948,2.7823,2.4456,9.4775,1.5107,2.9243,1.6544,3.6405,2.7771,3.4082,7.6542,5.5064,1.3123,3.1882,0.8201,4.1067,1.2402,3.8035,5.0492,3.802,1.8275,3.4323,6.6652,2.7129,0.4847,5.3501,4.9972,0.6303,6.7533,0.5573,7.681,6.3176,6.0634,3.641,7.2564,3.0103,1.8162,11.0458,0.9618,6.9695,0.4615,2.2316,9.1566,1.5992,2.7868,2.2057,2.2737,4.2503,5.2804,0.0089,1.7994,5.7734,0.4037,6.1461,1.904,3.2641,6.5094,1.0086,4.7906,3.9315,2.8753,7.101,11.1035,2.8941,1.5756,6.5209,3.5521,0.6448,1.0788,1.8779,2.3159,2.9572,5.0058,0.4285,1.6913,2.819,1.4824,2.8876,0.8795,1.3503,1.726,2.7325,6.277,2.4589,1.6427,1.6113,1.4501,1.6077,6.309,2.0135,0.1545,7.3549,10.3544,2.1043,5.8467,0.2926,1.7341,4.6979,6.2949,2.6529,6.3725,1.6356,3.8244,1.0715,0.6325,6.1483,2.8473,5.6663,2.2566,0.8414,3.3081,1.6423,0.1461,3.7239,2.5488,3.2026,3.8557,2.63,2.4675,0.896,3.7507,0.622,5.5602,0.3637,1.5079,2.5854,5.2565,5.5779,2.5678,2.1944,2.8041,7.0108,3.9654,1.4753,5.1933,2.7272,4.808,5.0247,0.7661,4.7215,0.4917,0.7742,4.7903,1.5258,2.6778,1.5005,4.2561,2.813,7.6483,3.4785,0.3776,0.531,3.8787,7.388,12.6689,1.41,2.6354,4.7498,0.0585,0.1009,0.2848,0.0345,0.0009,0.002,0.0014,0.0006,0.0024,0.0006,0.0025,0.0247,0.0017,0.0005,0.002,0.0059,0.0011,0.0018,0.0008,0.0017,0.0007,0.0015,0.0022,0.0001,0.002,0.0006,0.024,0.0012,0.0011,0.0003,0.002,0.002,0.0005,0.0009,0.0031,0.0072,0.0007,0.0036,0.0028,0.0007,0.0217,0.007,0.005,0.0025,0.0033,0.0005,0.002,0.0026,0.0022,0.0223,0.0011,0.0017,0.0011,3.1653,2.5421,4.1809,5.8008,1.8723,5.0387,0.0722,0.056,2.7736,1.6869,0.2611,0.1825,0.353,3.627,2.0038,2.9893,5.1784,0.6291,2.54,5.9933,0.7449,0.4685,1.2032,4.9711,1.0637,2.4137,1.9778,0.6905,4.3345,18.6,8.5223,5.424,6.3127,1.679,6.9393,0.0302,2.4241,3.8562,4.9145,1.0499,2.5535,3.4876,0.7724,0.6409,4.5411,2.628,4.9356,0.01,4.3175,4.4257,8.2975,0.4284,1.0902,2.2136,5.465,0.8481,2.4166,0.5619,5.7891,2.2044,6.5324,2.0439,1.0779,0.5433,4.2846,1.4937,0.8504,1.8837,5.9261,6.6739,0.8257,4.5753,1.1738,2.1069,12.0988,0.3374,0.1477,1.2811,3.4011,0.5145,2.6057,5.037,1.3696,3.6088,5.9122,10.262,4.4549,0.4387,5.1567,1.7359,2.1628,7.6995,3.665,4.6964,0.9265,1.2868,3.0729,0.7116,6.3426,1.6315,2.0096,1.7588,3.0289,3.2909,0.6206,4.0239,1.9506,2.3526,0.6868,3.1334,0.9754,1.4753,3.1696,2.9455,2.6953,5.4587,4.5606,0.4743,2.795,1.7981,1.5896,0.2018,9.1088,1.7247,4.4502,2.1976,0.0537,3.5711,1.6325,3.7505,0.219,4.8103,8.9856,1.8058,1.8133,1.53,0.8124,10.7059,0.1962,0.0199,5.6308,5.7654,1.2933,0.3274,2.2199,4.4572,1.72,3.4487,2.8499,1.2344,3.2944,5.9878,3.2884,3.2248,4.5127,6.8056,0.8206,3.1977,3.3134,3.013,4.8736,1.9659,4.3611,0.8118,2.268,2.3735,2.3529,6.5783,4.702,6.8585,0.2101,0.4687,2.6416,2.652,3.3696,3.497,2.7839,0.7796,3.4072,3.0766,1.0182,1.6579,3.7932,6.9381,0.4191,3.1803,1.8857,3.2783,0.5369,3.148,3.3073,3.0212,0.0932,2.5653,2.4875,0.2857,1.4118,2.4531,3.1941,0.5301,6.5958,5.7194,0.4068,0.2323,4.2151,0.6542,6.2535,1.0276,6.3202,2.1677,0.9299,4.3612,0.6552,3.5751,4.3678,0.2672,3.3743,3.0317,0.9352,1.5151,5.6895,3.1536,1.3953,0.9904,5.4865,1.5227,3.4747,0.3227,1.1348,5.0546,0.4428,2.3276,3.4593,2.0685,0.3144,0.5023,0.9289,5.749,6.9019,0.027,0.0049,0.0932,1.1242,1.9493,4.3776,5.4492,0.1327,0.0304,2.1867,3.1938,5.1256,4.1611,2.035,3.9327,0.872,0.3839,0.2587,2.1293,3.7936,0.3559,0.8657,2.9882,0.6677,2.5265,3.8878,0.5506,3.6007,1.9618,2.315,0.6027,0.1173,0.9288,0.3512,1.0878,3.4336,1.7593,0.5339,0.3645,0.1174,0.966,0.336,0.3088,4.3854,4.533,2.3947,0.5917,0.2479,2.3174,0.3935,4.7641,2.8061,3.5473,0.3773,4.5119,6.343,2.3316,0.5314,6.9249,1.1074,1.0476,1.3672,3.6977,0.0037,4.0817,4.5813,4.8468,1.1004,3.6635,1.0823,3.6198,1.9008,0.7286,0.2809,1.6282,2.2869,3.2173,6.018,0.1869,3.5779,4.9099,1.5503,5.7885,2.6519,3.2053,5.5787,1.7902,2.5949,0.2232,2.5378,0.3135,3.8817,7.0928,2.4147,4.812,0.2422,1.7544,1.109,1.8578,2.3663,7.3025,0.6151,0.7426,0.8682,2.0871,1.3391,7.259,2.7297,11.2141,4.5724,7.6888,6.2469,3.0694,6.747,1.5364,2.3025,3.4466,0.0151,8.2709,1.4047,1.9618,0.5238,1.063,11.8972,0.006,0.4567,3.7781,0.7467,0.395,0.1664,4.5411,1.9771,3.0595,5.1074,3.2056,2.3464,1.5599,2.5695,4.2268,2.4372,1.8322,5.7867,2.1207,3.1592,1.0498,1.873,4.892,4.4903,2.5697,9.8164,3.0272,2.3361,4.2654,3.0474,0.3736,0.1749,0.5978,1.6485,0.8451,4.554,4.4042,3.8605,2.7757,5.92,0.0045,2.0277,2.288,2.3118,2.1316,0.5739,2.2514,3.7047,0.3257,0.6184,0.3484,2.5251,2.0852,0.0016,4.1532,2.0293,1.402,4.6415,0.0948,5.0922,1.8825,4.9966,5.2943,0.5971,5.9737,0.5187,2.9893,1.6477,3.8718,5.4573,1.3002,1.2581,6.1672,1.5786,0.3599,1.6769,4.0753,8.0008,3.3092,4.8214,1.8169]}
{"prompt":"As a person goes through his life , he is given three options at the end of each day , continue , restart day , or restart life . He has just lived through the worst day of his life .","text":"As a person goes through his life, he is given three options at the end of each day, continue, restart day, or restart life. He has just lived through the worst day of his life. He is tired of being at that point of time. If I want to live in fear, I will get more scared and fear will create more problems for me. I am aware of my choices. Even if it is to live in fear, then I will face my problems. I have decided, I am going to face my problems.\nI was wondering is there another way to do this thing. Like there is a way to make the worst day the best day in your life.\nThanks for sharing and I hope you enjoy your new vehicle!! I have done the same thing after I broke down on a really bad road, I drove until I finished the tank of diesel with help from my buddies from the local motorcycle club(in case of an accident I could make it to the first AA shop in town). I had a great conversation with the young guy who helped me, now I'm still with them and love the Harley, now that I've gotten over the road mishap we go to concerts together and enjoy each other's company.\nI didn't stop for any repairs though. All I felt was anger because the mechanic and owner of the repair shop hadn't taken the time to get to know me and to spend some quality time understanding me as a person and as a motorcycle rider. Not even once did I feel sorry that I had been delayed in the shop because of things they had to fix. I just kept on riding, didn't stop and was thankful I had done all that I could to make it home and got my fuel tank filled up.\nI know it sounds sad in the words I used, but it's all just a phase my friend that passes once you get on the road again.\nI think my first response would be to thank God for His Mercy. I know it's not easy but I'm thankful I got home.\nHell yeah, I was so excited about being able to ride again. I had to have a gas tankful of gas before my ride. I am so thankful for my friends and family who got help me get to where the auto-parts store is. And that young man who fixed my bike, was a good soul too.\nI've learned this in the past so I know how people can seem rude and uncaring, but just know that you will find a lot of good people on the road.\nThanks everyone for the words of encouragement! So glad you were able to continue!! The motorcycle club has been a lifesaver for me, not only my husband and our Harley but all my fellow club riders we share our experiences. It's what saved me from having a breakdown. Thanks for sharing!\nHi, just stopped by to share in some of your words and thoughts. I've found that by writing myself down, as well as writing out things I do to help others during difficult times, it makes it easier to remember what I've learned. Some good sources: What to expect in Life, Things to Remember when Something Really Needs to Happen. Thanks for posting your story and I feel for you and your husband! Take care.","token_len":668,"entropy":[3.2258,6.1344,7.7421,1.3301,5.0256,2.5711,1.2281,1.6405,2.789,5.4467,5.9448,2.9178,5.3815,1.4442,0.9758,0.1632,1.6069,1.589,2.3636,10.6838,4.3678,8.2182,9.5521,2.1137,1.217,4.6864,4.7674,0.4549,2.954,3.1872,7.0037,7.7562,2.0557,1.7397,4.1396,2.5102,0.5942,0.0972,0.0377,1.0933,1.9076,2.0441,6.2391,1.2711,1.8927,5.0107,4.6175,1.1859,3.1706,2.594,1.4079,4.2532,4.2809,3.4512,0.2058,3.0741,3.4122,6.3967,1.1814,0.4796,2.2612,5.1084,5.1408,3.2182,2.4725,6.4443,1.8694,5.976,0.8601,2.5324,1.796,0.5515,0.3968,1.8891,2.1986,5.6139,0.8098,2.5596,4.5885,1.8292,5.7103,1.0759,2.8066,0.8353,3.7463,2.6613,1.2925,0.452,0.4934,5.7811,0.6845,1.3032,5.1091,2.3954,3.2896,1.6515,1.6082,2.2944,4.484,4.0241,1.8182,1.752,0.8846,0.0497,5.2753,0.8159,0.6421,0.7408,1.8203,5.7382,3.9707,5.7018,6.657,1.1565,4.3656,0.8586,0.5676,3.7131,0.814,6.0942,2.4507,6.2877,5.7622,0.7839,1.3196,3.1475,0.3829,3.1354,3.0558,5.2354,1.2889,4.972,1.2057,0.6287,3.6428,1.3184,0.0287,0.8875,1.8008,6.6408,0.8634,3.1974,3.7547,2.1245,0.7387,0.5454,2.4029,2.2593,3.256,9.6686,5.5804,3.6951,2.711,4.3101,3.4944,2.1503,1.078,6.5224,2.7516,6.4068,2.423,3.2073,2.3754,6.415,1.0463,5.4548,3.8301,1.9146,4.5074,6.9244,0.4667,6.5382,2.1813,5.4267,4.7456,3.6584,4.9845,6.7597,0.4498,1.1369,4.7874,4.5679,1.8718,3.6613,4.6759,1.2463,7.4782,5.4234,3.0665,3.2862,3.8333,0.4987,3.103,3.8292,4.2975,1.0471,1.8278,0.9746,5.1153,9.199,6.2636,1.7477,1.583,1.6881,1.2705,3.0369,2.0193,3.2297,7.2901,0.1921,2.3016,6.3341,2.0661,1.4788,2.7261,0.2775,2.8591,5.7946,1.2775,2.9191,5.0322,4.4446,3.3415,1.6131,6.3919,3.2526,7.8526,3.7046,5.1858,4.1505,0.5632,2.2128,3.0915,2.8968,1.1072,3.6949,6.2324,0.1286,5.62,5.6163,1.2524,8.7471,4.02,1.9556,4.4676,2.4209,0.0577,0.4822,0.0773,0.6342,1.3258,1.7374,5.8045,0.0009,5.7588,3.1009,3.0822,8.4459,5.1214,1.2027,5.0586,0.9937,6.2158,0.5079,5.2861,4.9092,3.2221,5.2055,3.9789,4.5431,1.3764,0.4435,5.5585,0.3445,7.035,0.0008,3.754,2.2927,0.5832,0.0755,3.3887,3.0849,3.2523,0.217,1.621,4.1044,6.5911,2.5327,5.4267,0.008,5.0774,0.9302,4.0149,0.7378,0.4091,1.8782,1.9276,0.2561,3.1392,1.9307,0.2596,5.5523,3.3607,4.0768,0.7705,0.9754,2.7966,3.8985,4.397,0.6946,1.3474,2.9976,6.9649,2.7323,2.6062,5.2817,3.1505,1.5184,5.6951,5.2343,1.7005,2.6707,3.1115,0.8489,1.5941,3.7531,4.0406,2.4288,4.1056,2.2091,5.519,0.0002,1.7566,3.196,3.7225,3.7475,3.0167,1.3633,3.2411,3.4254,1.8856,0.9608,0.3685,0.9656,1.8364,1.8529,5.0016,2.7585,5.081,2.6777,6.4472,2.8761,2.9618,2.3836,0.8161,1.2194,1.2066,4.2285,2.4934,2.2025,5.2068,5.2606,1.3125,6.3597,4.2926,2.2482,1.4659,0.1334,2.1868,1.5626,4.4835,3.9729,1.916,7.5197,6.5742,5.2092,5.3976,8.6315,7.5377,2.9786,1.662,4.4498,1.0866,0.5029,5.0505,0.9227,2.4117,1.3933,4.0119,3.7479,4.049,6.0677,3.6881,0.3685,0.8131,4.6173,3.9381,0.9274,7.8597,5.3484,1.3562,1.2463,2.8181,1.9791,1.1758,1.7027,2.7888,2.8068,0.9408,2.4365,2.8859,2.5656,2.2156,3.9676,2.5467,1.7962,8.4409,2.0485,1.132,0.9259,3.1623,3.5186,2.8925,2.5865,4.5225,2.1789,0.003,2.267,2.8255,1.1701,0.9885,2.9946,2.2489,3.849,1.3765,5.7837,1.093,9.8305,0.5862,1.3767,4.3644,3.1666,2.1485,1.4636,0.9468,4.0675,1.7614,1.0068,1.3962,2.5096,3.3124,1.1772,0.9766,1.7522,4.7892,6.3348,6.7539,2.2989,2.1096,2.1849,6.4506,7.0572,5.4335,3.1017,1.6957,1.0755,2.0281,4.3283,3.8287,8.4704,1.694,1.2513,6.9167,1.0689,4.6917,2.6526,4.2264,2.4725,3.6362,6.5472,3.8885,0.3421,1.5017,1.2332,3.7749,3.9139,4.8151,3.984,1.3368,1.0867,5.0881,1.1092,2.9847,2.1963,5.813,2.5474,9.0648,6.3224,1.6706,6.6318,0.3366,3.1549,0.5138,5.4222,3.801,0.7576,2.5336,3.0423,3.14,1.9221,3.2462,0.4581,2.6746,0.7236,3.5133,0.4889,0.1567,1.277,1.6658,3.515,4.7304,0.7617,2.4144,6.7352,1.9498,0.4605,3.4253,5.9669,2.9225,1.2209,2.8749,0.9219,0.0015,4.4474,7.5154,5.3731,5.4659,4.0782,2.7222,1.4661,1.6589,4.7707,0.0133,1.1675,0.2031,1.9738,5.4179,0.3484,4.2052,5.5089,1.2247,5.3092,8.0982,3.3478,2.9422,1.4478,4.4202,6.8932,3.3301,6.5246,4.767,2.7116,4.5731,2.3534,3.0333,0.9097,5.427,3.8366,0.7768,1.0096,2.5661,2.2226,4.9086,2.1394,4.4845,1.2255,1.6346,3.28,0.8123,5.272,1.7492,5.9,7.0688,0.5386,2.1421,3.6861,5.8532,2.2096,1.1047,1.5117,4.0227,2.7143,2.3826,0.7661,1.1274,3.0118,5.2959,2.0634,5.7469,4.7046,6.2638,3.1687,1.9016,5.5484,2.2629,0.0347,3.7313,4.0238,4.9588,1.2247,4.8297,2.1436,1.8203,0.6272,6.7663,2.9583,0.1331,0.3512,2.6022,2.8031,2.0811,0.4237,0.7544,3.5565,1.6079,1.0481,2.268,3.9946,0.8692,5.5267,5.4993,7.1919,2.4714,6.3221,2.895,5.553,2.3614,7.3437,2.4009,5.4399,0.8027,3.7781,5.0559,7.6009,3.8885,5.6429,0.6036,1.5802,0.0008,2.6155,5.3622,0.9167,4.3401,2.6541,4.5445,1.9264,2.9534,5.41,5.6148,0.7512,2.539,1.6814,5.926,2.799,7.6733,0.2855,2.5528]}

Hogwarts has a new professor : Tony Stark","text":"A muggle genius successfully uses his advanced technology to fake magic and infiltrate the wizarding community to assess if they are a threat. Hogwarts has a new professor : Tony Stark and his company\nWhat an exciting and wonderful day for the students of Hogwarts School for Magical Wonders in order to welcome to their life a special little wizard ; Professor M.H. Potter. A muggle genius, a brilliant scientist and a renowned teacher with some of the most complicated and difficult to deal with cases. Tony Stark and his company are proud of have hired their services as a teacher. He will bring a different and unique approach to their classwork. As an expert in science, he combines his knowledge with magic to tackle the cases that he must solve. To be able to do so, he is required to be completely invisible and completely controlled by him. Tony Stark is an Iron-Man, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from being a good and caring father for his son. His goal is clear and they don\u2019t want that their son ever experiences what the young wizard had.\nHedwig the Golden Wasp, known in their wizard world as the Hedwig of the Wand, has returned to help Harry to help him deal with the cases that he will get to tackle. She was one of his friends until she betrayed him, but this time he had nothing to be ashamed. She will be an extra in his books, assisting him when he is stuck at home because he can\u2019t take the stress of his job in school. He is not an only child and he has a friend. A girl that he can\u2019t remember the name right now, but she\u2019s cute! Her name is Hermione Granger and she works as a teacher and a witch in their wizarding world. They are best friends, but there is something between them, a mystery. She is going to have to deal with the case. Harry needs a new teacher to help with his schoolwork. They hire Professor M.H. Potter and he immediately feels that he and Hermione will make an amazing team. He can see the magic in his daughter and she will find out soon.\nHewitt and Jones have some issues getting the word out about their new album. The band has been going full steam ahead the past few years \u2014 releasing three EPs, making headway to tour with a number of support acts, and having their songs feature in two very interesting projects, Ritual and A Dose, both of which we have covered on MetalSucks!\nWhile Hewitt and Jones aren\u2019t complaining about the promotional opportunities, they\u2019ve decided time is of the essence. A few days ago, they posted \u201cThis record is like Christmas, or the day of your graduation! It\u2019s long overdue and so grateful to have you guys!\u201d on their MySpace. But, for those who don\u2019t know, the record isn\u2019t really available yet \u2013 only on vinyl and CD, and most likely for pick-up in person from them.\nThis is a huge deal for this band, which has played consistently with a number of artists as well as putting out several records since forming in 2003. It\u2019s nice to see Hewitt and Jones making new noise.","token_len":669,"entropy":[8.2063,4.7395,7.9878,9.3235,4.1801,2.1512,6.1058,2.6138,0.2668,8.6144,4.9298,1.995,6.9301,1.0585,2.7249,0.0154,3.4674,2.9217,10.2173,4.55,2.5034,0.9379,3.413,0.3433,1.1087,8.1664,2.6405,1.6785,5.9235,4.3614,8.8888,8.8422,3.73,4.2815,1.1619,5.7872,6.7105,8.007,5.169,4.0277,3.4353,4.101,3.9527,1.9053,1.656,5.1271,1.2324,0.2254,4.3968,3.7449,7.2395,8.8599,4.091,8.0937,0.0549,6.9864,5.0915,3.1178,6.5847,2.2571,6.1049,6.0451,1.3385,7.1327,4.5835,5.3806,2.4929,3.8303,0.1395,3.6144,1.8895,4.2374,4.4119,0.0035,0.0763,5.9856,3.3238,3.3292,3.099,1.3272,0.4842,6.7629,3.9137,4.0264,4.3187,1.6362,0.0406,0.8162,6.4697,1.6435,4.1667,4.7376,3.6539,0.0059,6.4155,2.2958,4.321,0.9387,2.3122,0.1234,0.4295,2.0045,5.5829,1.5169,9.923,6.4337,3.8171,6.5488,2.6006,1.3363,5.1816,3.2379,3.2435,3.3051,4.4845,2.3284,4.7265,3.5886,2.8006,1.6544,0.1875,2.8665,3.6209,7.9625,1.0581,4.1631,3.1501,3.2107,1.1071,4.7132,1.0309,1.6845,6.2512,1.4195,1.562,2.0049,5.3315,0.9124,6.4782,1.9157,5.127,2.2699,3.6419,5.1957,1.0629,0.9555,4.823,3.0596,2.2878,0.012,2.1974,2.3349,0.6444,1.1452,3.1264,3.0643,0.1051,2.2862,5.5805,4.4609,1.9114,3.6422,5.4996,1.7393,5.0182,0.437,2.7159,0.5279,1.6459,2.8911,7.867,2.6081,1.9372,1.8119,2.8799,4.5017,3.3656,15.8223,7.7526,0.9493,2.9685,0.3108,0.2051,1.6413,1.17,4.0713,3.6688,3.8883,2.7425,4.4676,0.2758,1.9425,0.5755,3.4777,5.5686,0.2942,6.3963,2.055,4.6473,5.6193,0.2289,0.491,0.0477,2.0134,4.4324,7.2793,0.71,5.0582,5.8357,4.1762,3.8095,6.0932,1.1597,4.542,1.5754,2.7215,5.2159,5.6474,0.257,3.7624,5.812,4.3835,4.516,2.9804,5.8156,3.0828,5.3942,4.4845,5.3366,0.0884,1.1707,5.7742,0.0021,1.641,1.7918,7.4436,2.4047,2.4978,6.2835,0.6106,5.9989,3.8178,4.1162,5.2098,1.2903,3.1394,0.0052,1.1392,6.5821,1.4245,1.3025,4.6622,5.6129,2.3157,6.2031,1.0993,1.994,3.7266,3.3077,0.0234,3.2297,3.6526,6.1006,1.6615,5.2166,0.3336,2.2819,2.6491,5.0348,0.7929,2.7543,4.422,4.5944,0.5263,5.3255,1.853,6.2518,1.8962,2.7366,1.5816,4.044,4.6642,1.9066,1.6717,6.301,1.7988,5.7551,0.6656,3.2754,0.6743,1.9506,4.872,3.3991,3.3194,5.8315,1.2045,3.0081,4.2149,0.1769,0.0115,3.8954,2.342,6.2067,1.025,2.769,1.9293,4.1338,2.9344,0.9049,2.378,1.6659,3.6782,3.9168,7.2412,3.753,3.3339,1.4936,1.8796,1.9081,5.3875,3.2924,4.6707,5.3963,4.034,1.9742,3.6485,2.3524,0.053,0.0019,5.9743,4.5178,1.1651,8.5897,0.7257,1.2035,1.5584,1.6796,3.18,0.0752,0.6112,5.8434,3.8331,4.586,1.1985,0.2807,3.9894,1.719,1.8012,0.3816,5.5108,1.4644,0.5396,2.6972,2.3972,2.7213,3.6805,2.1703,3.6561,5.1684,1.7507,3.2734,0.282,4.3043,1.183,4.9209,0.0386,2.2484,1.4804,4.1069,0.9776,1.838,5.4483,0.2605,3.1668,2.52,5.3142,2.1818,2.9694,1.2951,4.6753,0.2422,2.8787,0.4321,2.1317,0.003,1.7638,2.479,3.929,3.7187,4.0453,2.6182,1.927,2.6089,2.1069,1.0406,3.9305,1.1463,4.6443,0.7516,0.9349,3.6514,9.268,3.971,2.0144,0.0941,0.3555,0.0908,0.8815,2.3221,1.8672,7.1369,6.4583,2.3335,1.1097,5.0084,0.6006,3.0329,4.3501,2.6817,1.8584,3.0826,0.6676,2.0263,3.5507,3.6133,2.3596,3.8412,2.2029,2.6581,3.388,1.6321,2.8139,1.3912,5.2254,1.979,5.4856,1.5942,1.643,2.6759,5.9663,3.5318,3.025,8.1877,2.9492,5.2258,4.9639,6.0334,2.8715,4.388,0.0436,0.9273,1.627,2.1052,10.0293,1.3153,2.5251,1.7838,2.0418,1.3799,5.0019,5.5968,0.6446,0.1595,6.2314,1.2356,0.6654,1.8482,8.6575,6.9605,3.4657,6.584,0.0115,2.0634,5.0944,7.3272,0.0336,5.659,5.7598,2.4873,2.9764,3.6342,0.03,8.1034,1.5088,1.8449,0.7316,4.195,2.5295,5.3729,5.5575,2.3865,5.0699,6.0619,5.9271,4.2778,2.9735,10.483,1.5445,4.7193,5.9968,4.8953,4.3998,2.365,0.8477,0.0151,5.5038,2.2646,4.4269,2.7129,8.8365,4.8491,1.393,4.3144,1.721,5.9967,9.6805,0.0011,0.5895,0.037,4.5036,0.8427,0.4099,0.0242,6.4358,0.7118,1.2584,9.0771,5.3982,1.4156,1.1296,2.8929,0.1071,1.9024,4.4142,10.1616,1.6268,1.774,0.0043,0.0105,1.1634,4.1216,2.7872,2.4893,0.5319,1.0358,1.1889,3.2262,7.3753,5.3359,6.8184,7.3038,1.4448,5.783,5.2371,2.3758,4.7608,3.2111,3.7854,2.6173,3.3418,5.9017,3.7192,2.818,1.5514,0.4522,0.2506,7.3789,1.7033,1.8314,4.4061,7.444,1.402,2.5555,2.2194,3.5637,4.4212,3.8711,5.9647,8.354,2.6313,8.8173,1.1244,3.1044,5.9122,2.5141,4.0265,2.1085,1.2126,1.9349,0.1683,0.3292,0.0188,1.1104,0.2472,2.6292,3.0006,4.7697,0.1153,0.3264,0.0252,3.3684,6.0328,2.7496,7.2249,3.6125,3.0823,2.044,1.9921,1.8963,2.2176,1.6536,5.4294,2.5081,3.7652,8.6741,0.9974,0.2594,2.1815,6.6247,4.1299,5.4163,1.0476,2.6933,3.4173,1.2009,1.5963,4.6988,2.1635,0.6629,4.1757,0.2394,1.414,3.6808,1.588,5.4308,6.1084,3.7556,2.964,2.4709,0.0053,3.0049,4.8204,0.4926,0.1509,7.1843,0.8491,4.5828,4.073,3.6031,6.9818,0.9465,3.3532,0.2869,2.6032,2.4797,0.0728,0.022,5.8509,0.3514,0.5665,3.243,0.0013,0.2367,0.0168,4.3168,5.3184,6.564,2.9715]}
{"prompt":"There is only 10 billion souls available for humanity . Everyone has one . The population reaches 10 billion . The next baby is born ...","text":"There is only 10 billion souls available for humanity. Everyone has one. The population reaches 10 billion. The next baby is born... He becomes the \" 10 billionth \" soul. Everyone says that they do not like to be the \" 10 billionth soul of humanity. \"\nWhat is the difference between the souls for the humanity, and what is their nature? Should one have special qualities in a soul that is required to be called by humanity?\nI read somewhere,that the soul with \" consciousness \" is the one with its own name? In other words...the very soul with the spirit can be the only one that is chosen and that is needed by humanity? And if in such a way, then, what if we have two souls one of them have the spirit and the other, a soul with an undeveloped consciousness with \" name \"; Can it be that the other soul is needed in the evolution of humanity?\nWhat is the essence of the human soul? Can we call it \" consciousness, name, ego, spirit etc. \"?\nThis is why in one chapter of the book you referred to : \" The creation of Gods souls and their nature \"... this chapter is one of the most important chapters of the book.\nI read your answer about the human soul was not chosen to become a soul of a human, and it did not want to. Is such a choice possible only if someone has a free will to choose? In this case, in his own free will, he chooses a soul that is closer to the spiritual nature?\nWhat is \" closest \" to something like this? Because we can say that there are souls in all people.\nOne of the most common arguments against the existence of God is that God is to be able to choose such a soul for each human being!\nThe same reason we do not see animals have souls.. they do not have freewill. So we can not say that a dog has a soul. But people do!!\nOne of my close friends of mine, who believes in God, said about my soul : it is \" close \", but not close enough for her.\nWe need a soul for humans, because we are the only animals that live after death. It is not clear if we would have to have souls in other animal species.\nYou can always assume that the soul could be something bigger and stronger than a simple thought, for example, consciousness. But there are other thoughts with consciousness, as well as without consciousness. What is a sense of the soul is, what gives it its nature. But it also depends on how it is developed. There may be one and one soul among animals, who is not developed for the human soul, but you will say, why do it is not enough for a soul to have a consciousness for humanity?\nNo, it is not enough! It should have a soul that fits humanity. If they do not have a soul that is close to the spiritual nature, it is not the right soul.\nI do not mean by a soul without spirit. I do not know the difference between such, and the spiritual soul.

Add an important quotation. Finish the story with an ending that will encourage the reader to become a member of the profession.\" Write a story about a hobby you know nothing about. Do no research. Write the first line. Then add information. Add to the list of points as your mind grows. After you can spell the name of the person you should have finished the story before the weekend. Keep track of information. When you finish the story you can ask yourself if it adds new information. If so keep writing. At this point if it has new information you may have a professional article.\nThere was a time when men were known for their athletic prowess and strength. Men knew better but they played ball anyway.\nA couple of years ago a story got into print in which a woman said she would not be willing to play with a man who worked all the time. She was a nurse.\nI was wondering why this woman felt obliged to say this. Why should a woman go to work only because the man does not get out of bed. A woman who had a husband who stayed in bed all day did not feel obliged to go out for work.\nI think that a man working all day may be an asset to the family because he takes care of the finances. I think women go to work because they enjoy being with other people and they like the work. I think they get more satisfaction out of the work because there is also more contact with people.\nIn all seriousness I think that a man who stays all day in bed is probably not a great guy. He does not know how to go out and go to the store or take a weekend trip. When does he get out of bed. If he feels the need to go to the store he may not know where the nearest store is.\nMaybe this was all true when I was young. Then I did not like work and thought it sucked. This was also the reason that I enjoyed work less in college. I had to go to college and work to earn the money that I needed to go to school. Now I am old enough to know that there may be some truth in the statement. A man who is married should take care of his family and he has to work. The family is too big today to leave everything to one person. When men are at their homes with kids they can be pretty great husbands. They know how to make the family happier. They are good guys to work with.\nThere was a woman who was very religious and always had a glass of wine before she went to sleep. On one occasion the husband took her to church and she was not feeling well. She woke up when the preacher was preaching to the congregation. She became angry because she did not want the preacher to preach to the congregation. Since all the other preachers said the same thing the woman asked them to stop.\nIn other words this woman was not happy. But now she was being religious and she was going to church. While she was going to church she did not know that the preacher was getting off on her. Maybe when she got home she told somebody about how much she enjoyed the preaching when she got home.","token_len":671,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.3894,10.4211,5.5053,3.4012,3.9531,5.1537,0.0658,0.8017,4.8538,6.0707,2.135,1.0227,8.5657,5.2335,5.2044,2.1018,5.3564,5.3916,1.0345,6.056,2.2236,4.0014,6.2599,2.3809,6.1546,3.3617,4.3815,7.0265,0.9385,6.5505,1.6376,0.3216,1.7921,2.4454,6.7482,1.4655,2.9961,5.5966,3.129,0.133,0.1084,5.5823,1.1759,4.7365,0.4111,0.6068,1.0116,5.2412,8.1468,0.9313,1.6596,0.5994,0.4643,5.8883,0.39,0.764,0.0913,0.0006,0.1419,0.3084,0.0598,0.0018,0.0016,5.4124,4.9032,3.4154,3.6082,2.5648,3.4004,1.8548,5.6081,2.8236,3.4906,5.3761,0.4455,3.6858,1.5008,5.8975,4.9926,4.6349,8.3761,4.2451,1.037,5.0234,2.1389,6.2773,7.7987,2.4971,3.0361,0.3494,0.7148,4.4537,1.4104,6.2436,4.438,5.7062,1.5572,0.2019,7.1326,3.1509,11.118,1.3111,5.2086,4.323,0.033,7.3363,2.6517,4.186,0.592,2.1701,1.2277,0.1936,1.9082,2.1919,4.4421,2.0584,2.2898,1.799,6.64,5.0728,1.3033,1.8312,2.0913,1.2033,5.8418,3.0229,1.2715,5.103,1.8137,0.1212,5.5009,3.6837,3.8453,3.7619,0.0937,1.508,3.1539,2.9194,2.5082,8.3903,6.3373,2.5014,2.2038,8.0524,4.9365,0.8902,1.0258,0.4332,6.6972,1.8354,4.1228,1.5461,0.877,6.4669,1.014,1.6566,3.4314,0.6048,3.9445,4.9591,4.7576,5.0444,1.8726,6.4545,3.9678,6.2762,0.2672,3.3322,4.1033,5.3639,0.4698,0.7405,0.1442,2.3177,4.5897,4.797,4.3465,2.5773,2.869,3.2687,0.7707,3.088,3.6536,1.5337,3.9997,3.4786,1.9664,4.0977,0.0139,4.1021,3.0334,1.0212,0.5475,1.3219,5.2387,5.475,2.3876,0.2313,0.6353,1.6776,2.0781,3.0313,5.5929,1.4519,2.4666,2.7808,2.3781,4.9456,2.8918,2.8178,2.0854,4.1193,5.4025,0.0989,3.197,1.986,0.8393,3.5794,2.8229,2.1714,1.1072,5.4068,1.2614,2.1382,4.1385,3.2088,3.8817,0.7403,3.8764,1.015,4.7074,5.1455,0.4506,0.8589,2.9273,4.3601,1.5418,1.9731,4.3342,2.4905,4.0201,1.9549,6.9602,2.7499,0.6223,3.6567,0.9307,4.2925,0.2018,2.0425,0.5305,0.1333,2.2678,1.4234,3.1015,2.459,0.8744,1.2788,1.9523,3.0909,1.9707,3.599,1.9627,4.9599,1.1995,2.1918,3.4754,1.2008,3.4667,5.9061,0.9896,1.7608,3.2207,4.0137,0.7564,5.2853,0.4944,0.0247,1.349,7.0735,0.9073,2.6376,1.3425,4.5824,6.0224,0.8607,0.2876,1.8413,0.5206,3.4718,2.5365,2.5912,4.1217,1.5059,1.6264,2.2568,3.1277,2.3535,3.6877,0.6787,1.9885,0.6145,3.4705,3.6965,3.3277,2.2443,1.1243,0.0155,2.3124,0.7748,1.4742,4.0581,0.4349,5.7736,2.072,7.6429,1.2022,2.9965,0.8979,0.8289,3.9269,4.6715,3.3621,1.5066,1.5073,1.0494,1.5289,0.831,1.3454,4.2572,4.4944,0.1761,3.4175,0.2769,2.1854,4.3161,1.5387,1.4403,3.3328,3.608,0.5189,2.1355,2.9005,0.3463,3.465,1.033,0.0933,4.2932,0.7889,1.6432,4.6586,1.1456,1.2398,2.0292,2.1313,3.9165,1.4564,6.7202,3.1253,0.6109,4.81,7.8965,1.6511,1.5757,2.234,0.6628,0.0228,4.3773,3.2316,0.3976,5.8205,3.4846,0.2134,0.1457,0.8719,2.2336,0.7208,0.4214,1.6481,2.5389,1.8484,5.2085,3.1852,2.8905,4.0398,1.3297,0.1256,0.36,1.3415,5.5516,3.2911,3.5248,3.6303,5.2448,3.4093,0.7138,0.5429,2.9627,0.6314,4.9213,0.8088,4.6979,1.6015,3.765,4.8919,1.8368,4.3193,1.8397,7.8215,0.4323,4.985,1.9337,4.3649,3.2661,3.3795,2.8063,0.7125,6.2532,4.9029,5.5138,4.5683,2.4926,0.5081,1.3708,3.3174,2.5077,2.6376,0.6839,1.8844,2.3912,2.6992,4.3192,2.0212,4.2553,0.8741,2.8067,0.4657,1.569,0.8595,2.3485,0.5143,1.5629,0.3301,4.1671,0.5735,1.8976,5.2091,0.8902,0.2751,2.1561,0.7728,3.6238,4.4261,0.2818,2.2327,4.9705,0.9411,2.018,3.1917,1.2338,4.9846,0.7566,0.6586,2.7155,5.3011,4.6256,3.583,0.4804,0.0205,0.6736,1.2076,1.6075,2.8373,3.2206,1.3561,2.583,2.1147,3.7726,4.1627,1.6822,5.1427,2.2714,7.5938,1.351,4.3809,6.1248,1.0907,3.8025,1.7214,0.4843,4.2855,4.2825,1.7752,4.5425,2.6437,6.0503,4.3526,3.1579,1.2278,3.1693,2.29,5.3824,6.129,4.3144,0.5725,2.9948,4.1724,1.0296,0.0491,3.2854,2.6123,1.8837,5.721,0.6567,2.576,2.1199,3.0158,5.7185,3.6276,2.5802,0.3316,0.5233,1.1385,3.8963,1.8953,0.5976,4.4629,0.4201,2.1244,3.1206,5.7805,1.2868,4.9977,2.521,0.8902,7.1067,0.0776,0.6634,4.6144,1.7894,0.8155,0.4748,3.515,0.2963,6.0702,2.5101,0.8453,3.5372,3.4828,3.7125,0.2571,0.6055,1.6811,1.0261,2.0102,2.339,3.3466,5.4911,0.6225,0.4202,1.5199,6.8777,0.1209,5.3262,1.7325,4.5311,2.4009,1.9455,3.1192,1.0558,0.5844,0.6659,1.6777,5.3465,2.5714,3.3534,0.956,2.3111,0.004,1.7125,2.5064,1.7516,0.2602,2.6727,0.5669,1.8164,0.5855,0.3029,6.6932,5.9418,1.0491,3.5087,8.5133,0.0068,5.3789,2.3992,0.2355,0.3599,1.9818,1.4141,4.8661,3.9391,0.6637,1.9498,1.4944,1.5655,3.3633,3.8845,0.1847,3.9488,1.1641,1.6133,1.5354,3.7219,1.8267,4.5038,4.5692,0.9006,2.3435,4.6886,4.1203,1.1564,1.3634,1.3336,3.4813,0.1798,1.2737,0.7339,6.6498,0.8508,0.2046,2.2287,0.6,0.0767,0.6679,3.7156,0.2945,2.2175,2.4846,1.4006,0.6968,0.7398,5.689,4.1979,0.8408,2.6685,1.0613,5.3481,5.2434,0.4565,2.3325,1.3252,0.7203,4.9095,6.3657,2.3379,3.3246,3.0656,0.4855,2.8534,1.5401,4.2489,6.1065,0.351,2.8913,0.1542,0.5045]}

One day, you meet a woman who has nothing but static echoing from her. All you have to do is give her a chance, and you will be amazed at your own talents and how you can inspire someone out of darkness.\nI recently started working out again\u2026I haven\u2019t been working out as much the last year or two as I wanted but for some reason I just wanted to get back to it.\nAfter trying out different programs over the past year with my partner, I realized just how much I have missed working out and the amazing benefits it had on my body and mind.\nI decided to join this local gym because I\u2019ve always loved the design, but it was super expensive. I ended up cutting my membership in half (which wasn\u2019t really in my budget) but it made me really appreciate how much I needed to work towards getting back in shape.\nI was also super lucky that I got some awesome perks as a member. I got personal coach training for free ($45 value for two sessions). I also got to test out the weightlifting equipment for about a week. I had the opportunity to work with two coaches so they could teach me how to do new lifts. I had to actually buy a new exercise mat and two weight bags which was a bit uncomfortable but it ultimately saved me money over the next year.\nI got one more month trial period to join so I didn\u2019t have to pay anything but I really missed the gym. I also think the gym\u2019s owner had to give me a discount because I decided to stay with them the past year. He saw me work out with a lot of people a few times a week and that\u2019s how I decided to stay. I\u2019m super competitive (so when I saw the perks, they totally came up to my head!) and he was a huge part of the reason why I wanted to do it.\nHe\u2019s the best and really gives me a personal training and nutritional recommendations especially if I\u2019m just at the gym for workout only. He was also super helpful with other members I went to the gym with.\nSomehow, I couldn\u2019t get into the pool this time of year to work out. It\u2019s usually like an amazing experience, but there was really too much happening. When I was able to go, I decided to get back into shape so I figured a workout would not do me any harm. My fitness instructor suggested one workout on Friday nights.\nI actually feel that even though I can\u2019t swim, you can still do something to workout if you don\u2019t make it to the pool every day. This workout I made sure to use resistance bands in for all the upper body work as opposed to just using weights. You can totally make this workout work as cardio which is super important if you\u2019re looking to bulk up as well.\nI always find it interesting how you tend to get to this point as a woman and you realize this\u2026you get into a groove where you start to forget how to eat healthy. I guess this is really what helped me push forward again.","token_len":673,"entropy":[6.654,2.8661,1.8534,8.8073,3.3109,1.2072,6.7147,1.7282,6.2397,2.1358,4.443,0.9135,0.3667,1.5555,1.2755,2.6032,3.7168,3.5567,2.7204,0.4595,0.5273,0.8677,2.7282,5.7577,0.7479,0.9179,6.0309,2.3071,1.1166,1.316,6.3853,1.5856,2.9197,1.1138,2.2376,6.796,1.3408,12.3839,12.1055,2.8732,1.3992,4.6341,5.1961,1.5697,1.1891,0.1752,0.0383,0.0694,5.16,0.2266,0.9158,4.7566,2.097,0.4947,1.7517,0.8445,1.4714,6.0279,0.9433,3.7179,2.0806,4.72,1.6813,4.68,2.1845,0.8361,4.5007,3.9538,6.7553,1.1233,5.5854,0.9827,1.1443,7.4548,5.3142,3.8478,2.9863,5.3298,5.0967,7.2657,2.9359,5.2514,16.3423,8.372,0.4385,1.8057,3.4181,0.4548,3.5673,1.3286,6.1815,0.6697,2.4489,2.3473,1.8192,3.9826,0.1776,2.3869,4.1442,5.6325,2.4133,0.1317,0.9322,2.9743,3.1634,0.1186,2.2857,1.9505,0.7505,3.4044,0.7133,2.6549,4.6081,5.6087,1.442,4.0572,5.8808,4.1056,0.0995,1.7259,1.5229,4.8776,3.207,3.4698,1.097,0.652,3.24,4.769,0.1559,0.877,1.0186,3.4598,3.5432,4.1417,0.164,2.1234,3.6601,4.8776,3.8813,2.1342,6.517,2.0529,0.6128,2.2165,1.4592,0.8252,0.188,1.3619,1.2947,4.0108,0.2858,5.5406,4.1664,6.418,1.3626,3.3594,0.888,11.3277,0.5306,2.9452,2.2911,2.1272,2.5483,10.2041,2.9849,3.0007,2.5295,1.5619,7.4031,4.288,1.387,1.2552,4.4382,0.0022,5.2752,2.2744,4.9474,2.9898,0.0503,3.9732,2.6432,4.4202,2.2027,0.4464,0.0927,3.3992,5.7413,1.3575,0.9137,1.1797,3.1869,2.5401,3.9357,2.1773,3.0293,4.0548,3.023,0.8829,1.2072,5.0165,0.6709,2.3245,5.4513,3.6353,1.1695,3.3,0.265,0.6453,0.7021,1.2963,2.9418,2.8286,4.5345,3.1394,2.1516,0.8043,2.4187,3.8144,3.2801,5.3213,3.6657,1.5995,2.1299,1.5656,1.2211,1.3221,9.1197,7.3123,4.6875,2.5801,2.2824,6.6724,5.2078,7.0223,2.8769,4.4512,2.1015,3.5647,0.6112,2.2733,0.317,1.7217,6.4482,0.8467,2.3394,5.3581,2.02,4.1698,2.8907,6.8514,2.0605,0.9758,1.4402,1.3559,3.2347,3.0077,1.9798,0.0217,2.659,1.6811,3.9929,4.6002,5.4381,4.1409,1.8608,2.9445,0.0888,1.1624,0.0835,2.6592,5.7508,2.1754,1.6213,1.3421,3.0527,2.0557,5.9368,5.3922,1.3636,1.5319,6.5624,3.8306,2.2882,5.3397,5.5396,4.8342,4.1862,2.7474,1.7274,3.0974,5.9245,1.8331,1.9763,7.5836,3.0066,0.3446,2.5818,6.0734,0.6158,2.9181,1.5247,0.6141,0.498,1.213,3.4355,5.4477,2.5384,3.8287,8.8608,3.5442,1.8234,6.9137,3.4211,0.5455,3.4345,0.7059,0.0713,0.0032,0.7222,0.1174,2.7216,2.3651,2.9805,3.4575,3.782,6.3618,1.6975,2.0004,1.165,1.1033,3.1272,6.953,2.8594,1.6455,10.5363,0.0577,0.3631,6.4651,4.12,1.9683,2.7889,0.4002,0.9497,2.8102,2.0823,1.624,7.068,0.3304,2.766,3.8828,1.5432,5.3455,6.5678,1.1343,1.084,5.0938,6.1139,1.7144,3.1168,0.2369,3.0883,2.1618,3.8035,0.1653,2.1269,5.7626,1.085,0.8605,1.5057,0.3665,0.8348,4.7689,5.104,0.0319,0.6243,3.1109,1.6063,5.4826,0.1048,1.5523,0.493,1.6601,4.8649,0.047,2.9424,4.8078,6.9011,5.7184,5.884,4.7692,0.4101,3.9324,2.2451,7.5129,2.1766,4.6335,5.8954,4.9601,3.48,3.1506,1.2501,2.6407,2.9234,1.2498,3.0541,2.0214,3.9234,2.0651,4.2791,0.0075,2.3929,2.1602,1.5313,0.4071,3.8699,0.0314,4.034,1.6577,0.6365,0.6336,5.5255,3.8055,0.0639,1.3477,3.1248,2.2859,3.2707,5.3096,4.0625,0.7664,1.8361,6.9049,4.4684,4.1618,7.2487,6.7852,7.975,2.6237,0.5853,3.2181,0.0601,1.3666,4.3805,5.7199,1.7496,0.0476,2.3235,7.774,7.3051,0.3855,1.6221,3.8506,1.5498,2.3237,1.0093,1.9344,5.1435,0.8693,4.9598,4.5166,0.4845,2.9333,0.0699,0.2293,1.455,1.4026,5.9934,3.9565,0.6522,0.7193,5.1642,0.1542,0.1231,0.0007,2.1706,3.6066,0.9483,8.6573,4.907,0.97,4.2854,0.0913,4.9469,3.228,0.1805,1.9705,2.8043,3.2058,0.0229,0.26,7.1705,4.9419,4.0078,4.69,3.0879,2.5533,0.4172,3.7381,2.0821,3.6677,5.1755,0.1543,7.237,2.401,4.4721,0.3042,2.1021,4.746,0.0038,3.0116,4.9553,0.4771,4.2137,0.2653,3.253,1.5693,1.9942,4.2596,3.7118,0.4183,8.5369,5.4958,4.2775,2.1729,5.2621,5.6355,3.5423,0.058,1.3746,0.3255,4.2996,5.0556,6.3279,4.2083,5.1529,3.0783,4.3462,3.5716,3.9645,2.7376,1.8779,1.1054,4.924,5.9316,3.9586,5.816,0.408,0.5079,4.3736,3.2076,0.0332,0.0049,5.6995,1.1345,6.1587,0.7115,2.1686,1.7218,3.6353,3.5658,6.6362,3.9541,0.1038,3.3636,0.0924,0.072,0.0684,4.6209,1.3163,1.126,0.5526,1.9663,4.0499,1.0359,0.3307,3.7143,2.9203,4.126,4.89,3.4825,0.7879,4.4665,11.0327,2.4329,4.3559,6.5198,4.3837,1.3554,7.1024,0.1775,2.4568,3.6055,4.1418,0.0015,1.3737,3.1875,3.5716,0.8386,4.7187,1.0389,6.3576,4.0568,2.7989,0.4462,2.1592,4.0611,8.0859,6.6406,0.8982,3.3847,1.6959,3.085,0.0471,6.0423,0.0482,1.7819,2.6665,0.779,6.8674,0.1045,4.1849,2.3247,0.5855,0.6269,1.0496,5.5807,4.7003,1.5387,4.0968,1.8647,3.3603,6.6588,0.0206,2.7775,3.7598,2.5885,0.5419,3.8479,1.5965,4.9362,2.1671,3.9847,5.0772,3.9364,6.7981,2.1711,4.3852,4.0088,1.8457,3.7273,4.5051,0.2911,4.1761,0.6978,6.0522,2.8153,1.2308,5.233,5.4111,1.3476,1.8184,4.5619,2.7627,0.7971,4.2801,2.5516,5.44,0.225,7.0824,4.9055,6.0095,0.8658]}
{"prompt":"`` I 'm a good man . '' `` If so , then why are you here ? ''","text":"`` I'm a good man. '' `` If so, then why are you here? '' She asked, almost whispering. Her red, angry eyes flashed fire at him, her face paled to an almost white hue as she gazed at him. `` A long time ago I was a young man like you, thinking only of my own pleasures and desires. But soon I changed. I realized there are others living much, much worse than I had ever imagined, people who need help. I joined the military to do my duty, and then returned to my home. I have been working with the army and police in missions to help them with their work. '' Her voice was a whisper now. '' That is why I am here. I am supposed to bring you to the shelter, but it is closed. And I have to go back to my post with one of the kids. Can you give me directions on how to be there? '' He could hear her moving out of the house. On the other side of the driveway, she could be heard running down the street. Suddenly his senses heightened in alarm. He swung around abruptly in his movements to find the house abandoned in its entirety.\nHe had been walking along the road when he passed a pile of rusted old cars and rusted metal pieces of cars stacked in a circle, surrounded by grass and dirt. The cars were not in perfect shape, as the driver had used some kind of heavy equipment. He parked in the middle of the pile of cars.\nIt was pretty dark at he time. A few hundred yards away was a gas station. He parked the car and walked into the gas station, paying for his gas and driving the car out. He called the police dispatcher. He stated the name of the driver, the name of the vehicle, and the number. The dispatcher was notified and came to the scene. They quickly came over and got the car, a 1990 Dodge Monaco, towed out into the ditch, and placed it across from the pile of cars. They pulled the license plate off the car and compared it to what they had in their system. There was no match, and he was directed to go back to the gas station and leave the vehicle there. They returned a few minutes later to get the car towed off.\nA while later, a neighbor came to him and said they had seen a driver come around at the gas station earlier that day driving a vehicle that seemed to be familiar in the area. They were able to identify the driver. It was a young male who they knew and had seen before. He and his mother were close friends, and they would often share a meal together. They also lived close by.\nThe driver had driven the car out of the area, but had returned to retrieve it and leave it there. They asked the driver to come to the gas station and he did. He said he had parked it across the street, and the vehicle had just taken off from where the young male ( the driver ) had left it.\nThe female had an older daughter who lived nearby, and the father and the daughter were not on good terms. But there was no evidence of domestic violence. The father was on some kind of drugs at the time, but there were no physical signs of abuse.

{"prompt":"Write a review for the latest book by God `` Bible : The newest testament - confusions resolved , mistakes corrected '' .","text":"Write a review for the latest book by God `` Bible : The newest testament - confusions resolved, mistakes corrected ''. If you read this book you can be sure that you will understand the New Testament. I enjoyed my Bible reading experience. I will read it again.\nThis is the newest book in the New Testament series to clear up the differences in translations, interpretations, and applications of Biblical texts. It starts with the Gospel authors, as they were not as experienced and thoughtful men as the historical authors, and goes backward to the beginning of time. While this isn\u2019t a bad thing, sometimes these first writers were misreading and misinterpreting the scriptures to make themselves seem to have authority over others. This book does not only provide clarity on these first writings, but also on the first two centuries when there were significant changes in the translation of the gospels. In fact, the later New Testament writers often misinterpret these early writings. A significant number of scholars use the books in this series to refute the false gnostic interpretations of early Christians. While the idea that Paul may have been a Jewish convert can be refuted, the idea that Jesus was a prophet may still be an unsubstantiated belief. While a number of commentaries, and many students have criticized my position regarding Paul, it remains important to understand how the New Testament was formed. The book uses the earliest literature, and the New Testament gospels, and interprets them so that they are in agreement with the original thought process. If the New Testament had simply been formed by the canonical authors, without the later additions, then the interpretation that Paul was not a Jew, but rather a converted Jew, may be clearer.\nWhile Paul's letters to the churches are often used to show the differences between the OT and the NT, these letters were written while Paul was already in Rome, and are therefore different than the other letters. The author does a good job of explaining the OT and the gospels in conjunction with Paul's letters, and it makes a lot of sense. For example, when Paul said he did not speak in all languages, I would like to hear more evidence that he would not speak in Greek if he was in Athens. He also describes in a few sentences the difficulties that he experienced in speaking in Greek, which I feel is a good thing because it shows how these difficulties did not stop Paul from preaching the Good News to the Gentiles. Also the author discusses at length the difference between Paul and Peter and Mark. It may be confusing at times. However, if you are not a Bible researcher and you really can\u2019t understand the nuances of Greek and Hebrew, this is very good for you. While it is not as powerful as the other books in this series, it is very useful for students who are just getting started.\nThis is a good book for Bible students. This is the first book in this series that I have read. It provides good explanations of how the New Testament was formed. A lot of the time when the differences between the early gospels are discussed, students often focus on the differences between the four great gospels, or even in Paul\u2019s letters to the churches. While it is important to look at these differences, this is also a very useful book for Bible students who are just getting started in exploring their faith.","token_len":675,"entropy":[4.0641,6.1704,4.0575,2.9227,4.8682,4.1358,3.3239,9.6455,17.4143,10.935,5.8988,1.6205,10.0715,5.9022,5.3695,12.5214,4.2233,10.7698,2.65,5.3623,1.461,4.5624,6.3273,5.2686,0.209,6.0723,1.289,0.5074,2.0304,3.681,3.5622,0.5642,0.7299,1.3412,1.5159,4.1484,1.597,6.3309,0.1079,2.049,3.6185,6.6409,3.5835,4.616,2.0024,3.9361,1.5678,1.5,2.7141,3.8727,1.7974,0.2086,2.3445,3.127,6.0473,1.8961,1.8656,5.7208,1.8887,1.5572,1.0822,2.0931,0.0428,2.7244,5.2302,7.7848,0.5878,1.403,5.7498,2.0805,6.0825,2.8487,5.6553,0.7392,0.6942,7.9013,1.2523,4.8539,1.9487,0.4952,2.0142,6.4436,0.6013,1.1885,5.9196,8.364,2.386,4.6599,1.9504,3.0007,4.6722,5.3973,5.8027,3.1807,6.3978,7.8377,1.1984,1.8791,6.4698,2.4358,2.7605,1.9299,3.2604,9.0846,1.4195,0.7446,5.233,0.3041,4.2693,1.0622,5.0978,2.7096,6.6376,17.0509,8.3212,2.3015,1.7438,3.6383,1.2489,0.429,6.5556,4.5396,5.8291,5.2688,1.8648,5.6509,3.5904,2.7494,2.8823,2.2372,0.0003,0.0002,1.1059,3.4384,2.4541,2.427,3.4391,1.6795,3.8139,2.7277,5.8174,1.9471,2.9522,0.5879,2.4066,1.7391,3.5283,1.2784,5.3289,3.2901,4.6323,2.1086,2.6684,4.9318,4.4714,0.5318,0.3642,0.5503,2.4021,0.8958,4.4947,2.9244,4.4631,5.2573,4.1939,0.9414,4.9036,1.589,0.4788,0.9023,3.6193,0.9078,0.5483,6.7548,0.0002,0.6987,3.2703,2.4728,0.2222,1.8787,6.9581,4.3728,0.0346,1.945,4.999,4.9219,3.7059,2.3366,1.973,3.0562,4.8076,4.7913,2.5224,0.0722,3.6218,5.2585,1.1842,6.2151,2.7501,1.3212,2.0431,0.788,3.6228,1.3222,4.7156,10.8834,0.3639,3.6859,0.6624,3.8356,3.5672,0.716,4.8303,2.113,7.0391,1.4989,5.5308,5.7618,0.2385,1.0853,2.2865,5.4906,3.4945,4.839,0.4308,3.308,0.8986,1.5785,4.1349,0.1597,1.9643,1.182,1.0129,5.4009,4.4856,3.5559,0.2789,4.2343,6.4893,0.0701,0.0017,3.3991,0.5788,4.3966,4.3713,1.9469,0.0223,9.2708,0.0311,3.497,3.6414,3.1644,8.1212,2.5147,4.0687,5.1634,6.4942,4.2039,3.8248,1.6064,2.7963,4.8378,4.1146,0.4102,2.2805,2.9875,1.3837,1.841,0.0206,2.7142,5.2463,1.1074,1.9697,2.8292,5.4281,1.3622,3.1484,6.3286,2.4636,2.0133,2.0555,3.814,0.027,6.7835,0.0008,1.784,2.6449,5.0005,0.0047,1.0286,4.8279,0.7324,0.8274,1.3661,4.1559,3.2761,0.3807,0.8254,3.541,8.4103,4.0471,0.9826,4.4264,2.2757,2.0072,0.0049,3.962,5.748,0.4588,5.8456,1.9242,1.9802,9.1719,2.8581,0.6542,7.1784,1.5968,5.0999,6.2257,1.0782,1.4903,1.2625,5.2029,4.4698,2.3207,1.4006,3.1136,0.4064,1.4603,2.375,4.0377,2.1388,0.3555,7.3335,2.0599,0.6645,2.9521,2.2257,6.0481,0.6952,3.4141,4.8797,5.1136,1.7246,4.4756,1.9327,0.9123,6.8584,1.8091,3.8492,3.8946,1.2334,4.1041,1.6715,4.4701,0.805,0.8443,6.5614,0.3325,1.2613,1.1066,0.2387,3.9647,1.0236,2.6465,1.6763,5.066,1.7551,0.1058,6.0851,1.9173,3.041,1.7638,0.6857,3.4189,4.3826,4.6147,3.8173,0.7698,4.3052,1.3239,1.0228,1.6396,5.2414,3.3639,4.2405,1.2247,0.0127,0.3458,1.6449,1.1989,5.9057,1.7671,1.8979,5.8589,0.0001,2.0549,7.4806,0.4166,4.0681,0.4698,1.0755,1.2525,1.0531,3.5412,3.291,2.8284,2.6278,0.0561,0.0315,2.0988,4.1293,0.682,0.08,2.9579,1.0241,4.6623,3.7231,3.1592,0.0342,3.9649,2.9781,6.0206,2.9526,0.5578,4.7159,2.1723,4.716,0.1252,3.5074,3.2519,6.6125,1.3701,0.9494,5.0329,1.4708,1.1467,0.743,3.2857,5.1717,0.294,2.0472,2.2342,5.3106,0.446,3.8833,2.1718,6.4267,3.4687,3.4474,3.3261,2.2987,1.8242,4.3446,1.9141,1.9398,2.7128,1.3613,3.8346,1.7694,2.0702,1.3737,2.7166,2.0398,4.4922,1.1001,2.1924,1.8378,3.2937,3.3614,1.1485,2.3773,1.6072,5.2337,3.1207,4.5372,0.1232,3.9139,2.4574,0.3736,3.9011,2.233,7.8789,0.0833,1.9205,0.7727,1.8463,0.0328,0.4444,4.5004,3.8696,2.9225,4.0955,6.1317,0.1435,0.7473,4.5487,0.1808,4.9059,1.4295,4.6114,2.2909,7.6532,1.6267,3.3889,4.3775,0.9149,5.0806,1.8586,1.3155,3.217,2.8703,0.1026,3.1101,0.524,1.6467,2.5053,2.2828,3.6356,5.0366,1.711,1.7181,4.9508,4.8599,7.713,0.5421,0.0364,1.4455,1.0986,5.7886,0.3374,4.8227,1.6264,1.9177,0.5765,2.2597,1.8404,4.2501,3.5599,2.7578,0.1776,0.2569,5.1089,2.5474,0.9991,1.6478,2.5467,6.2972,0.3744,1.0815,2.627,2.0629,1.339,0.7866,0.1259,0.1594,0.956,0.73,2.5925,2.2535,1.2348,3.3313,1.2693,1.2554,4.2724,2.6694,0.3563,1.041,1.1529,2.4395,0.9186,1.5584,3.1423,0.6035,1.0406,5.2813,1.8893,1.6462,3.9301,0.8143,1.9258,1.0589,0.9909,1.0853,3.0968,0.0776,1.3073,2.2166,0.7713,1.0984,3.055,1.1689,3.3781,4.9256,2.732,0.572,3.176,0.6862,1.5749,0.0069,0.9007,0.5334,2.1443,4.9139,2.2083,0.0637,1.5464,4.3446,4.5013,1.9368,7.232,0.7991,0.3407,6.1359,3.2541,0.0003,2.2442,2.0264,0.3516,4.2772,4.5656,5.3355,0.1448,0.7281,2.0915,0.6106,0.423,7.0505,5.4673,1.1654,0.0001,1.4631,3.2524,3.7433,4.5976,4.546,3.8991,0.0577,0.3565,0.5589,1.6304,0.2482,0.8092,0.2607,3.2954,2.5734,0.7388,3.3862,0.4096,4.7574,0.4156,2.2422,0.7452,1.3759,2.9313,1.8601,2.46,0.866,2.9914,2.0644,0.2992,0.486,3.1466,0.2975,1.3808,0.9117,1.3637,1.0802,0.0413,2.9727,7.9319,4.8165,3.4076,0.4749]}

Are you ready? - Pursue happiness - Use up to 4 characters - Use your mobile device to destroy the zombies - Keep track of the score - Create and share your own avatar Purchase items and improve your virtual character. The more, better. The good guys must fight to save the world\nIn a world where you can be everything from a god to a mere ant, one man has no choice but to fight for the truth and justice. Can he use magic to overthrow the corrupt governments and rise above his class? Will he have enough friends to stand up against those who would enslave him? Will he ever know what it is to be loved by someone? In this universe, everyone has a choice. The decisions you make can change your history and history changes how you live. What is your life story? You\u2019re in charge!\nHave you always wondered what it feels like to be a god? How do you make decisions? How powerful is your will? In this world you don\u2019t need to die, just change! Is it a choice to keep being this way? What other paths are open if you leave?\nThe story of a person who doesn\u2019t feel good about what he has, who is unhappy and needs the love of a special person. To love someone is not enough for him. The only thing that he understands how to receive is the respect, kindness and caress. The girl wants to give her all to her partner, but she has already realized that this is not possible.\nAt the age of 16, Anna has given up her beautiful body to help a poor and neglected family who had no other way to support it with the money. A little older, she began to love young men in her local pub and had sex with them on the spot, then became pregnant and gave up her baby for adoption. At the age of 38, her friend, a nurse with many clients, takes to bed with her new husband, her body he wants and the young age of his companion. Now she lives alone at home with all the children.\nTwo brothers with different personalities. Both are very strong, both in character and physical strength. One, who is just twenty years old, only wants to know the world, the other, who is more mature, wants to take advantage of every opportunity to make a living and grow professionally. Their stories will be very different, but one of them will never forget those months together. And when it comes to giving up the future and getting the present, who will have to choose?\nNashville, Tennessee. You\u2019ve never seen a country boy like him. One with a country dream but a rock star look. One with a talent so powerful he can create his own music that could touch an angel. A rock star that can sing country but doesn\u2019t listen to the rules. That can play a guitar with fingernails like nails, that can be as wild as the wind and as sweet as a siren. That can sing with emotion and love the passion of passion. Is there such a person? Is there a person like this? There is only one.","token_len":675,"entropy":[10.9437,5.7452,7.2124,1.9753,2.2375,4.0319,7.0097,5.0063,1.5384,6.6883,0.0029,5.1395,1.2067,7.5528,5.0269,0.6633,7.5381,3.5898,4.5952,2.3706,1.5721,5.4718,2.6482,4.4424,1.501,1.7371,5.1501,2.205,8.0283,0.783,5.5191,0.9833,1.7212,6.7739,0.753,1.8025,1.1154,6.7063,11.1027,1.7981,8.3814,3.4926,5.3542,6.7565,5.4208,4.0173,5.8604,1.5624,3.3396,3.4449,7.9126,1.5556,1.2407,7.565,1.8584,0.8561,0.7739,5.6034,3.2517,0.0186,1.9185,7.5065,1.0523,4.7202,3.2708,2.7796,1.5455,1.0211,5.4586,12.1716,5.3314,2.4637,7.0436,0.2964,4.7734,3.1624,2.8556,3.6867,2.9542,6.8912,8.4196,2.0018,3.2554,6.5589,3.5353,4.7715,4.0956,2.844,2.7312,0.8535,0.8703,5.7397,7.7645,3.1911,1.506,0.9272,3.2317,0.9925,3.7829,4.7971,4.4319,1.102,5.943,0.4977,0.3511,8.163,7.4281,0.3613,4.7303,3.4598,2.3091,3.5625,1.6687,0.0745,0.003,3.0748,1.613,1.9415,4.8318,2.3946,3.5462,1.931,5.5817,1.285,5.3007,6.0202,0.5542,6.9656,0.4645,3.2939,3.4512,1.5161,6.8051,1.695,2.4595,7.217,1.4369,2.4352,0.4507,3.5446,3.2674,4.0264,0.448,3.354,0.6506,2.1932,4.158,0.7814,2.3122,4.0265,0.0008,0.544,0.5272,1.8171,0.2371,4.2752,4.4552,1.726,1.6442,1.3999,1.5612,0.4769,6.6302,2.3103,4.1534,1.9977,4.2322,1.4096,4.9776,0.4819,4.454,1.4741,1.3529,2.684,0.8508,2.4878,5.8398,1.9484,0.0807,2.3732,1.572,2.1083,6.9973,1.6327,4.4271,4.6116,5.4993,0.4483,1.5614,0.9967,4.0337,2.3598,1.5645,3.4562,4.1304,0.4739,4.0785,17.6032,9.6474,2.6261,3.9645,2.5427,2.5349,2.4215,5.8851,0.7609,4.9248,4.0068,0.8495,1.0435,3.1493,0.0231,0.0948,0.4697,1.0258,4.0774,0.4324,3.4569,1.4227,0.1322,3.7486,3.2725,1.7071,2.3381,8.0741,1.495,0.641,5.1848,0.4095,4.1309,0.363,0.9836,3.0579,4.5138,1.8618,0.5335,0.2914,2.6653,0.4384,6.2623,2.6614,2.8361,5.2967,7.0333,6.5947,1.4327,3.0573,2.9748,2.2185,4.8766,4.672,6.3376,0.8148,1.6761,3.1696,5.7417,7.3103,1.9927,3.8089,4.7923,0.2669,6.161,2.0847,2.0227,2.9401,3.989,1.2387,2.7418,5.0465,0.9857,5.3892,0.0782,0.1581,0.1907,4.8503,4.1778,1.1552,2.6847,0.4688,1.4214,4.5441,2.0836,2.3309,5.1198,1.5225,5.2703,4.8295,4.7234,0.3579,2.6717,7.8082,2.389,1.4905,5.3145,5.7385,1.7781,1.4813,2.4743,3.7424,3.4503,3.191,1.0135,2.9109,2.7099,2.2749,1.2035,3.258,7.7726,5.9237,0.3355,7.7788,0.5912,2.077,6.1725,3.9004,3.954,0.3275,11.5168,0.9997,3.1643,2.5695,6.3425,4.8324,0.7114,4.5197,2.7096,3.4289,2.1551,3.1878,5.9037,1.1644,1.2245,1.4539,2.7315,5.2725,6.2265,0.5724,3.3845,1.1445,0.5691,3.0055,0.5156,2.463,5.7343,0.9239,3.6814,0.0183,2.9963,0.3263,5.3313,3.2247,5.6619,1.2874,1.3981,6.7628,3.7461,1.3159,5.0158,2.7666,5.7276,4.4713,3.3592,2.897,4.4291,3.271,2.2301,3.7908,2.9075,1.2562,2.1679,3.5246,6.9628,2.8419,1.9382,3.2468,4.2797,4.3701,6.2716,1.3217,0.9001,4.1016,0.4306,4.8022,7.3711,1.3349,3.882,1.7515,5.3547,5.5587,1.7027,3.7483,5.5742,0.1029,0.4161,4.2319,0.964,2.9751,2.5602,4.4461,4.3531,2.5674,2.0149,3.0048,4.9081,1.2804,5.5034,3.8674,1.5443,0.2365,4.3346,1.0453,0.4281,0.0109,6.0572,0.145,2.8744,4.6904,2.4649,2.3262,4.8361,4.4399,5.9065,5.5979,0.4981,5.9387,5.6672,6.4722,1.8429,0.4954,6.0971,2.8357,1.8452,5.6303,5.9632,7.6139,4.8708,3.5871,2.7561,4.8833,8.361,1.2002,2.5002,6.7971,1.0224,4.7335,1.7637,4.083,1.8848,4.6364,0.8061,1.5393,4.8951,1.349,2.9529,2.827,1.5882,6.46,5.0858,4.7476,2.5585,2.1416,3.5319,4.2179,1.9662,3.6398,3.9409,1.7491,4.0162,6.0609,5.3167,0.7453,3.9576,1.475,0.3778,3.1764,3.5211,2.6939,1.181,4.9117,6.2421,1.5956,0.1374,0.2617,5.9782,2.9027,0.2575,5.7223,2.2935,3.7777,2.0256,0.8032,4.5208,1.2726,0.5368,0.4374,4.1609,2.499,1.2333,3.0223,0.1823,5.1591,4.2498,0.021,4.3251,0.3996,1.2678,3.2892,1.6237,2.338,2.1208,4.4052,6.9616,0.3299,3.8064,4.2846,3.3731,1.9196,3.2702,1.1279,1.8565,1.2741,4.574,2.0263,0.4022,0.929,4.1334,2.2002,5.6498,7.9725,3.8246,1.0365,4.782,3.2948,3.3431,0.3398,0.1822,5.4321,1.5798,2.1018,5.1544,3.0471,4.2448,2.8803,6.6296,0.3259,5.7203,1.1997,3.6779,3.3135,2.7912,1.3234,0.5795,7.141,5.7208,2.9684,1.8675,1.8725,2.3563,5.1838,4.1832,0.2134,3.006,2.1609,2.2524,1.5589,4.2862,9.7839,2.8244,3.9303,0.8415,4.9112,4.7592,1.2335,6.3935,6.9384,5.054,1.8056,7.6895,1.6808,5.6411,0.7622,2.4971,1.0227,0.8263,6.9491,5.6165,3.9654,2.3503,1.9561,5.3533,2.7039,0.0467,2.9582,4.3551,4.19,7.1212,5.5058,7.9029,0.8098,2.8059,5.6563,0.1643,2.9188,2.1926,3.7471,7.0018,5.032,4.7348,0.054,0.0943,0.0217,5.0669,0.0552,2.0149,5.1759,1.3683,4.76,5.1975,6.999,1.2273,10.4224,4.3921,11.9132,0.251,0.1087,5.222,8.0696,1.8528,3.4546,0.323,3.2372,5.0484,7.204,0.4025,2.3921,2.7179,2.2675,4.5907,5.4639,0.0559,2.8209,5.9306,2.1184,0.539,2.9083,1.0913,2.7417,2.3351,6.7027,1.718,4.6423,4.5822,6.9212,0.5373,6.0413,0.8348,5.9927,2.3792,4.1115,0.1113,2.525,2.0878,2.5948,0.5885,2.2282,2.5668,2.7488,2.6514,0.8249,4.5082,0.7455,3.6322,0.2784,2.0025]}
{"prompt":"years after the human extinction werewolves and vampires have brought their ancient war out in the open . Rumors spread , on both sides , of a single human survivor .","text":"years after the human extinction werewolves and vampires have brought their ancient war out in the open. Rumors spread, on both sides, of a single human survivor. Now, as the vampires make their final push on London, a single man from his human life has gone in search of his lost child. Will a single man be able to stop a vampire army?\nI do like horror movies, but this one...ugh! So many stupid clich\u00e9s and one thing was still missing in this movie...the originality. I am glad the movie was only one long shot and it was well done.\ni remember back in the late 80s\/early 90s there was this really good movie called The Babadook that came out, I saw it once and it's not in my collection anymore, but I do remember the fact that it was kind of horrifying lol\nThere was some good stuff in the second half of the movie... but it was really, really bad in the first part. Really bad.\nI liked the concept and idea of the film, but didn't enjoy the movie as much as someone who was supposedly a horror fan (I didn't finish it until half an hour in, didn't even finish the credits)\nI think I'm going to try it again, because I can see how the second half of the movie is a better film than the first, but the first half wasn't half bad. The film as a whole wasn't good, especially when compared to other horror film of its era. In my opinion the film tried too hard to be different and it was too complicated and didn't deliver on any of its promises.\nThere is much talk about how movies are made to fit the expectations of the audience. Well, I'm sure at least half of this is true, but the other half is far too many times outweighed by the amount of effort it takes to make a good horror film.\nThe movie starts with a lot of promise. A good twist, good camera work, a good villain,... but the movie was definitely too good to be true. If it wasn't for a bit of a surprise ending, the film wouldn't have earned half of the critical praise it received.\nYou may remember the '90s action flick Predator... I didn't. I think I saw the trailer once and it sucked me in but I wasn't able to watch it until later because I didn't want to go through it again. That's probably why I never had much interest in seeing this movie for the first time.\nIt was a good, well-produced movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I was expecting it to be a typical, predictable sci-fi action\/horror movie and it was, but I didn't find it boring or unoriginal. I thought the movie was a good mix of action, sci-fi, and thrillers and I thought it was interesting at times. The movie was definitely good and worth watching on TV if you were a fan of action and sci-fi.\nThis was a movie that really didn't excite me at all or made me want to see it again. It was a pretty average looking movie. It was like a typical Hollywood production, nothing spectacular. I didn't notice much that you wouldn't see in any other similar kind of movie.","token_len":676,"entropy":[6.12,1.3154,8.5253,4.4537,6.7987,9.5706,2.8861,3.7779,5.3863,6.9675,3.3731,5.2894,6.5817,7.9045,3.6769,1.0216,0.8492,1.2017,8.2773,0.4947,4.3066,4.3153,6.8794,2.1166,0.3988,0.6557,2.2549,1.4643,6.1371,4.1273,4.3652,2.923,4.3958,1.0116,3.6472,1.3165,5.4474,5.6006,0.2732,3.4129,1.7864,3.344,6.09,0.3172,2.6213,5.5805,3.3109,3.9448,4.0761,6.6801,6.0221,2.2124,4.8017,5.1757,0.2514,0.0476,1.9327,1.4205,4.6729,0.5709,3.5418,4.4094,2.9141,1.3763,3.5273,0.2471,0.002,2.2623,3.1591,2.2805,5.5175,1.9247,1.7726,9.7103,5.2145,4.2166,5.3076,1.2089,0.934,1.2061,2.9246,0.7585,7.1488,8.7949,3.1222,4.6487,2.6462,7.8883,6.3097,0.0026,2.0486,5.7772,4.1489,5.2335,6.2799,3.8971,2.8862,1.8554,1.6018,2.3162,3.0404,4.6227,4.6875,1.2762,2.3231,4.3039,4.0013,2.623,2.6538,1.958,5.6593,4.5213,5.1019,3.0042,2.1869,2.7142,1.9335,4.4059,1.7899,0.5445,2.8061,8.5892,5.4231,4.9414,1.0553,0.929,4.6378,1.2776,0.869,5.5731,0.0225,0.0175,0.0909,3.3803,0.3822,2.209,4.7222,2.5834,2.5973,0.5271,2.445,7.9148,2.0017,0.039,2.7833,4.0494,0.0549,3.5134,4.1404,5.543,0.3525,3.923,1.1039,1.4404,3.5294,3.9104,4.6685,2.0158,1.5737,2.8543,1.6346,1.1359,1.9045,4.0468,1.0973,2.3488,4.6019,0.1919,1.1443,0.6861,5.0894,0.004,7.4744,7.7414,2.8977,5.2365,1.5179,3.2103,3.6288,1.0389,1.2537,1.7072,5.1516,0.5339,0.6017,0.5095,0.3732,3.8768,4.9114,1.8905,0.9529,3.4992,3.9874,0.0622,1.0724,3.9611,1.1944,1.0857,2.7959,0.8416,6.1072,0.3615,1.3895,1.5131,2.4329,4.1174,1.1392,5.2487,2.8394,6.7492,0.5758,1.2586,3.9421,1.3941,0.9246,4.7084,0.0006,3.2331,0.7042,3.1134,2.2024,0.0765,0.5296,8.6879,0.8006,2.4048,8.1455,2.0445,4.8467,1.1096,3.8029,2.3059,4.0371,0.0012,7.793,1.2768,2.8727,6.5694,5.3179,0.0078,3.5222,1.7051,5.3881,0.0009,3.6133,1.019,1.4629,6.1206,2.6373,1.2247,1.9162,2.7454,2.7187,3.6559,1.2559,0.0525,3.6916,4.7381,0.4369,2.1996,3.1615,1.1239,4.2198,3.0292,1.9967,2.3595,3.5149,0.1035,1.0397,0.4684,0.2337,1.8207,2.5504,4.8795,2.8832,1.1621,0.2537,0.0656,2.3097,0.8082,3.2032,1.8866,0.5403,4.6791,0.0013,7.789,0.4402,1.0831,1.9949,3.8546,6.8848,0.2902,0.0085,3.8985,0.001,4.2844,1.4169,4.8037,2.6575,1.9361,0.0477,3.3757,1.3362,5.0982,2.4923,4.2004,2.0848,0.6879,4.7453,2.4889,0.2455,2.6479,2.9605,7.7772,2.7068,0.2095,0.5698,1.0306,5.72,2.5485,2.8937,1.8054,3.6262,5.8657,2.0058,4.3917,0.0005,4.0549,2.0222,3.4991,0.3266,0.7612,1.0713,0.2982,1.3333,3.997,2.255,5.3202,5.8251,0.7405,1.9899,6.2875,1.7517,2.3054,3.4798,4.8448,2.1872,4.9061,0.0926,1.3688,1.0032,1.4849,4.1398,0.4956,1.7858,2.3687,2.6272,5.9708,1.2161,3.1877,0.2203,4.0209,1.5529,0.6021,1.0071,0.3942,2.9939,3.0238,0.0371,0.5923,4.8357,2.9841,4.5966,4.7817,11.8249,0.0005,0.044,0.5979,4.0599,0.0439,4.7038,3.3652,1.2706,0.163,0.9933,1.0939,2.2232,1.5173,1.1446,0.2495,1.5943,2.4256,2.7036,4.2729,1.6888,0.8891,3.8724,0.0315,7.4234,1.6754,3.5398,3.6043,6.4879,2.0871,4.2209,6.1774,0.4378,0.3283,2.5885,1.2253,3.4679,8.1051,3.0046,2.3178,1.9692,4.256,5.5618,2.5402,2.5564,1.1236,1.3179,0.1339,0.4272,4.549,2.8796,2.5194,0.0006,0.9951,3.5494,4.1541,0.0527,3.7617,4.7782,4.0607,0.6969,2.0098,1.853,2.7635,0.0006,0.775,5.44,7.5072,0.9137,1.7277,3.8052,2.1618,0.6295,3.3666,0.7541,1.0002,4.6916,3.6764,2.0018,1.8466,5.7053,3.4964,0.0326,5.586,2.3219,7.7849,4.1433,2.9258,3.6957,0.0008,5.4893,1.652,3.1152,1.7782,3.4571,2.14,4.1871,5.2641,1.8046,1.4572,5.6184,4.724,0.1457,4.5422,1.0411,4.6305,0.0008,3.9419,0.0026,2.0992,0.2784,4.0806,3.8867,4.2198,0.9408,2.1526,0.0007,1.7245,0.1238,3.9129,1.91,2.538,0.4548,0.3733,4.1752,1.3701,3.9434,1.3886,0.6201,4.226,4.381,4.4953,1.5612,0.1114,3.9512,2.2147,0.5644,5.398,1.2276,1.4715,0.2072,0.6292,1.0182,3.4435,1.6219,1.7431,2.6859,4.1188,2.5334,2.3959,3.7139,1.553,2.1508,1.4023,3.163,0.5463,2.1642,0.1026,0.5593,1.3912,3.0889,4.4277,3.3025,0.092,0.3173,1.0729,6.841,3.9169,6.9441,5.3784,0.0387,0.0028,2.7019,3.7211,3.0022,0.0,0.6344,3.1074,1.3504,1.2446,2.2466,1.7533,1.5924,2.0195,0.0008,4.5253,0.4571,6.3332,2.1462,5.4333,2.357,0.4065,1.5759,3.8881,1.4724,2.2475,0.4829,2.2773,1.8364,3.6667,0.0437,2.1911,1.5032,3.659,0.0071,0.0022,0.6977,1.4455,7.0859,0.085,2.4483,1.2033,3.0265,0.6616,0.6137,4.0614,5.3431,2.2907,0.7742,2.367,2.428,1.4611,4.3271,3.4878,2.1029,5.4462,0.9654,4.9312,5.5849,2.7848,0.066,4.2386,1.471,0.9583,0.1281,1.5336,2.2694,3.0393,0.0055,0.0016,0.6782,0.704,3.6469,2.2696,1.476,2.8377,0.8519,3.7703,2.9356,0.0007,8.337,0.0055,0.0764,2.3249,0.2434,5.102,5.0522,0.1277,1.8454,0.0248,3.2601,1.9705,0.4457,0.3838,1.6652,0.9063,1.5427,3.9258,4.232,5.072,0.8387,2.6425,1.6957,1.1278,5.163,1.0979,3.4944,5.2055,5.7493,1.4385,6.0649,3.4297,2.0076,1.8308,2.7999,0.0006,5.019,1.5453,4.8972,5.9147,2.7874,0.0008,1.3947,0.8142,3.1741,0.4893,6.3252,5.2232,0.0007,1.5484,0.8845]}
{"prompt":"You find a rip in time walking through the alleys . You enter it to find yourself on a metal table with surgical instruments on a chair next to you .","text":"You find a rip in time walking through the alleys. You enter it to find yourself on a metal table with surgical instruments on a chair next to you. You find all the wounds of the past you have ignored. I can see you with a smile coming across the table.\nWe meet in the middle. There is the old man of the present as well as the doctor with his young assistant. The old man tells the doctor that he should not have allowed these creatures into the lab. He told him that he should not put his hands into the workings of nature. As well as not mixing with the dark forces.\nNow he is old and his eyes glowing with his last strength. What can he do about it now. He does not want the power to be lost.\nHe thinks of the children out there. How much they miss the love of their father. As well as a place they can belong.\nYou open a door and find yourself in a cavernous place underground. You think of the lab and all the work that has gone in on your creation. You think of all the pain this means from the people you have wronged.\nYou take a key and enter a room with your head. A chair beside you. A gun by you. You think not to shoot it yourself. You think that it is going to be you who takes the last hit from the cold steel. However you would feel better about it. You see your creation. A creature made of your thoughts and memories.\nYou know that you can take it from then place and make it stronger. The mind will come through the body. You thought they would need a piece of the mind so that they could come through the barrier. There was not enough in your creation to give it this power.\nYou are out of your head and you hear your name. You go back and close the door behind you. As you go back you see that what you thought was an empty lab is now full of people. There is one figure that stands out from the rest. Your creation. You look at her and see a warm glow that comes across her face. You see her eyes as well as her smile. She is a perfect creature. You smile at her and smile back. She seems to like you.\nYou hear the figure approach you. It is small. She hovers around you in a thin glow. It is like a shadow. You take a step back and you do not know what to think of it.\nYou feel the cold steel in your hand. It is an empty feel. You pick up the small glass object and take a step back. It is an empty glass object. You look at yourself in the mirror and you cannot see the person in there. It is just a shadow. What does it have to do with me. When you turn back to the person who is approaching what do you see. You see the same glow you had seen a moment before.\nYou remember the young assistant who was standing next to you. He is standing with a small group of people.

{"prompt":"After you die you are given the chance to go back and change one decision during your life , possibly changing the outcome of your life entirely . The right change might even save you from the circumstances of your death .","text":"After you die you are given the chance to go back and change one decision during your life, possibly changing the outcome of your life entirely. The right change might even save you from the circumstances of your death. So, if you feel this is something that you want to do, just don\u2019t forget to ask the spirit guides for their advice.\nWhen you start this practice, you will find it hard to finish it. Don\u2019t worry, it is just the start of a much bigger journey that you are going on. Start where you feel comfortable with and build from there. It is important also that you have the right spirit guides guiding you.\nWhat are your thoughts on this topic? (you can also add your own comment below) I will do my best to answer!\nThe truth is, that if we really believe in life after death and believe that we are immortals, that life is only a passage and not one of them is going to be a struggle after all. If we choose to go on to the spiritual side, to the one that is just as real and just as real as the one that can be seen, we must first remove from our minds the things that were happening to them in the physical side, and the most important thing here is to get rid of the fear that we feel.\nIn order to get rid of the fear, we must understand that we can live without thinking about everything that is happening and we will not feel anything if we don\u2019t. We might not have the ability to avoid what happened in the world here, but we can certainly avoid thinking about it and not cling to it. We just have to look after our spirit to see that we don\u2019t lose it.\nWe can even see this way of life as a challenge, that we have to get rid of everything that we need to, so it can be in our best interest. So, by all means, try to do it, it might only take a while until we start to feel that there is nothing more left that we need to do, but do it, don\u2019t give up on the dream, don\u2019t think about it every time you wake up.\nLife is a journey and after we die, we will have to take another one where we will have to start over. This is something that we always know, but somehow we don\u2019t get out of it, we keep on going on like it doesn\u2019t matter what, we just have to be here.\nSome of us might think it\u2019s the same thing, but it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t see what they are doing. They don\u2019t see that they are just trying to do what they are doing but they are always trying something else. They don\u2019t care if they do it right or wrong, they just do it and not care.\nAs soon as you take the view that life in the spiritual world will just be the same as in this world, you will understand that there is nothing more to do but what is required and to live in a way that doesn\u2019t bring you happiness. You have to take the time to understand everything that happens in this world so that you can understand what will happen to you in a spiritual world.","token_len":679,"entropy":[4.5152,7.0926,2.4759,2.797,3.9939,1.7832,2.9123,0.0442,4.1204,0.742,2.6229,4.6432,5.2161,10.8397,6.1298,1.4909,1.8056,2.4071,6.6915,3.1874,1.4386,2.8869,0.2143,1.6651,1.415,5.3297,0.2904,3.0162,7.2578,6.5764,4.9378,3.6519,4.3594,0.6048,0.9766,2.3718,8.4907,1.3541,1.0242,1.1001,0.6963,4.3035,1.9539,2.0456,0.2457,4.7821,5.1528,1.4574,3.4068,1.496,0.7127,1.5086,0.2405,0.9781,0.6245,4.1354,4.0841,16.1649,7.5055,1.8988,2.4559,0.8933,3.4545,3.1716,7.8158,5.8168,2.3985,3.0495,1.0803,0.8292,1.2841,7.2287,0.8878,4.2577,3.983,5.6859,0.6143,0.987,0.9568,3.3276,3.197,3.2891,0.0667,5.7815,2.3634,0.9548,5.1458,1.2407,0.0586,0.0067,2.0757,1.4552,1.9023,1.6381,2.8545,3.2939,3.1589,0.8281,1.8647,3.6284,2.0741,2.6751,3.6054,0.9128,2.5351,1.2068,3.2106,0.6617,6.2453,8.4303,0.2751,3.6685,2.4207,2.4813,3.5784,5.7561,4.2163,2.0664,0.209,3.2532,0.9342,2.9502,7.2421,1.4502,0.1541,3.1441,1.8982,1.9797,2.8124,0.452,6.9947,0.0472,1.8598,1.4334,3.5669,2.253,1.3957,2.4076,0.6104,1.0873,2.7368,0.1251,6.3945,5.2998,0.6369,2.0081,4.5028,0.8643,0.7564,2.2393,1.0546,0.9936,5.2504,3.9383,4.0931,0.264,0.0255,0.0863,0.9377,6.4265,1.2449,3.9691,5.9141,0.3138,0.8648,4.2247,2.7828,3.7895,4.1817,4.1749,0.7236,4.0856,4.3386,0.0956,2.7909,3.1688,1.0626,1.8033,1.3957,10.035,2.5472,0.0007,0.727,3.1552,3.4247,1.5497,3.6212,2.1802,8.8785,4.3325,2.5239,5.7768,2.6648,5.3914,2.7656,3.5928,0.0199,1.1419,2.5698,7.5221,5.4445,2.2941,0.2378,2.7976,0.5858,6.1445,0.2541,3.1455,2.2393,3.4868,2.6777,5.5072,3.7593,1.3584,5.7258,2.1774,7.6043,1.644,1.4447,4.1855,2.769,3.6391,1.207,3.7461,0.0535,2.6954,0.9739,1.6308,1.8274,0.7047,4.7343,2.4674,3.5333,2.356,1.9755,4.889,4.1988,7.0469,4.3226,1.6074,2.5183,0.9179,4.7812,0.2283,4.1618,6.6825,1.6108,4.5503,2.6224,1.1768,5.4091,6.5081,2.1043,1.3259,2.8864,7.358,0.9041,1.7822,4.9776,0.3137,0.9201,4.0538,0.6723,0.037,1.0975,4.6143,1.6049,1.9553,3.4301,2.1559,1.5243,3.6807,1.9731,0.1084,2.1857,0.0509,0.0046,1.4713,0.1136,1.1435,0.4881,0.9332,4.7535,0.922,1.6014,2.6549,4.1808,2.5486,5.5734,1.9601,4.634,1.7358,1.2708,0.7748,3.8579,2.9618,3.3044,2.0972,3.2364,2.7627,3.9202,0.1757,1.7816,1.9156,0.0964,0.0372,2.6919,2.0194,5.7779,2.2566,3.1199,1.4367,3.2508,0.0501,7.3373,4.1584,3.3924,2.0463,0.6759,5.2516,8.2654,0.8645,0.6137,0.5221,1.4485,5.4357,2.2991,4.0232,0.2193,1.8368,2.4556,3.3964,9.8589,0.1147,1.1089,0.6478,1.7886,4.7062,1.4767,0.0497,4.3102,4.1156,1.4352,5.6587,5.2091,3.3659,1.5686,1.3174,2.6221,0.0652,0.051,0.0136,2.9883,2.4898,0.8873,0.8308,3.5665,1.6329,4.2434,3.5798,4.4875,4.845,2.5977,1.6018,3.0994,1.1517,5.6038,2.0439,3.4912,1.4434,2.4054,0.3624,3.8524,0.1915,0.0057,4.2217,0.5577,1.6479,5.5844,0.3997,4.023,3.425,4.2157,2.8542,0.7711,5.6932,0.9038,1.235,0.556,3.2724,3.5682,0.6137,5.3691,3.4763,0.0341,0.3308,3.3535,0.5364,2.582,2.516,2.4258,3.9769,3.3276,5.0519,1.4607,0.5969,3.4489,4.6447,2.5076,3.3446,0.7948,1.5931,2.3067,3.7953,0.3446,3.5047,3.9466,5.381,3.6345,0.5435,2.4098,0.4534,0.5213,2.1708,1.1218,4.6131,0.9852,2.4851,3.3925,0.13,0.031,0.0024,3.0346,0.1189,2.5196,2.78,3.7012,1.6862,1.8729,0.0213,0.0148,0.0068,4.2776,0.6164,1.4303,6.7194,2.6091,0.7241,2.9372,0.0179,1.3323,1.236,6.0685,1.1264,1.7193,2.1627,1.6276,5.7565,3.4359,3.2001,0.6982,0.6115,1.2718,2.2484,1.3316,3.6629,4.3635,2.6773,5.5262,0.2048,1.9897,2.4992,0.5106,4.0374,2.2757,1.4768,3.0523,1.1679,3.6943,0.3101,1.4711,4.9844,4.8863,2.6285,1.5153,7.2554,1.3796,2.384,0.0397,0.0246,0.0065,3.7962,4.6833,0.4387,0.6365,2.5072,1.7934,4.4791,1.7607,1.4335,2.6488,4.5591,2.9794,3.878,0.465,0.0148,0.0161,1.1134,2.4781,4.5058,1.1475,1.409,2.052,0.0144,3.6233,4.5572,1.7895,1.1166,5.5799,1.8448,2.3004,3.3131,1.4889,3.6698,6.756,0.0084,1.4801,3.8355,2.6739,1.7394,1.0764,0.8197,2.1702,4.484,0.0504,0.1851,1.1703,4.7573,5.0241,1.4136,0.0414,0.0279,0.0158,4.1853,3.2545,2.8161,1.2668,0.7794,1.7644,1.8742,2.5621,0.0132,0.0065,0.0018,0.8858,1.7254,1.2642,0.4613,4.0026,2.8227,0.1019,2.4644,1.9751,0.4105,1.6502,1.503,5.1481,1.3163,1.4473,4.9237,1.2355,6.3379,1.911,0.7106,2.5736,2.0506,0.0052,0.0061,0.0062,4.2598,1.8313,1.2566,2.8401,1.1218,2.0665,0.8692,0.5785,0.7242,0.7138,0.44,2.9965,0.2802,2.8793,5.132,2.7758,2.0235,1.1733,4.3601,3.1228,0.0087,1.2325,4.6939,1.64,7.5988,0.2655,2.0232,5.2993,1.2963,3.2795,1.9279,4.847,4.184,0.7336,2.5636,2.5046,1.2141,1.6503,5.5997,1.1433,0.2,1.287,0.7936,3.9361,0.7374,2.0028,0.578,2.1589,2.1459,0.9424,1.7686,3.8622,4.9944,1.8588,5.7318,2.3872,3.6305,3.0325,2.5417,2.2768,1.488,0.0922,4.3885,0.0614,0.0165,0.0042,5.294,1.2551,2.8396,0.8096,2.97,3.4182,0.4064,3.1579,1.5392,3.1136,0.2116,2.7249,4.5385,0.6588,2.7961,1.327,1.5362,0.3139,3.8506,0.2514,0.3593,0.6806,3.2199,1.9746,4.4683,0.4089,1.7863,0.1804,1.6011,3.7566,4.7133,1.3896,0.8395]}
{"prompt":"When you are reincarnated , you are placed in a random place in time . Your current life is during the first crusades , but you get random flashbacks of your past life from the 21st century ...","text":"When you are reincarnated, you are placed in a random place in time. Your current life is during the first crusades, but you get random flashbacks of your past life from the 21st century... and then get placed in the crusade at random.\nIf you are reincarnated, you will start with your current skills and level. You start with 1 health ( just get 1 ) and you get no health bars and no ammo and no hp when you die. You can die with nothing. When you die or get a hit or something, you will lose your current levels and skills and start at 0, and you get 1HP and 1 ammo, but with zero skills. You get 1 extra hp or mp when you spawn. You can do so many actions in a single turn, and this is where you can do actions like shooting or sneaking, and if you do so many actions, you can get points with these actions. This is where the game gets more interesting because you can use special skills like the spear, the crossbow, magic, etc. ( but you can only have 2 skill points ) but before you can get points you have to gain level points. These level points are what make the game more challenging because you have to fight for them.\nSo for example, when you killed an enemy with your spear, which you got in the 1st turn of the game, you get the spear's damage ( depending on the weapon and level of the enemy you killed ) and the bonus damage for the spear ( in this case it is +12, and to get more you have to kill higher level enemy and then you get much higher bonus ). If you get another spear-related bonus, like the bonus for killing a champion or any boss, it is shown in a small box ( you usually can only see it if you are dying, if you see the box, it means you have that bonus ). If you die with the spear, you will get 1 level point. But here is key to the game. When you have enough level points, you can use this skills, level increase your spear, and get better bonus damage. It is up to you to increase the spear level and get better bonus damage, or else the enemies in the game will kill you and you will lose your spear.\nAfter you get the spear, it will not be level 1 but a certain number after that. The levels depend mostly on the ammo you have. I usually level my spear to level 10 and I get a lot of bonuses. But the levels themselves depend primarily on the quality of your spear, so if you buy a very high quality spear, you can get a lot of level increases and so on. You don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money to buy very high quality items, but the higher level a weapon is, the more the bonus is.\nSo, like I said, you can play this game with multiple people together ( but there are some special items that make the game more difficult ( so you can play solo and you probably won't get that bonus bonus anymore, but still, you still have the same game ). If you are playing the game with other people, there is a small area you can hide in that will allow you to hide from the eye of enemy. If you kill the enemies there, you can easily get extra points.","token_len":680,"entropy":[3.8043,3.013,10.8967,0.3863,1.0225,0.8946,2.0492,5.5314,0.7052,0.9041,8.017,2.9257,2.4032,4.4595,1.1187,3.9072,3.9341,3.606,1.2949,8.0137,1.2107,4.5549,14.9241,1.8289,1.5877,2.479,1.4006,4.712,8.4264,7.0971,2.2684,1.2984,0.5755,1.2939,4.3102,1.5353,8.7373,0.0829,0.2018,6.5994,2.4526,2.4855,5.8025,7.4466,0.5299,1.8126,9.8083,4.2,4.6471,1.0977,1.8868,8.2426,0.1925,1.724,1.0756,0.01,0.8157,0.4093,2.5556,4.9328,3.1455,2.8489,1.3141,8.3647,1.4718,5.1283,1.4616,1.9115,4.0426,1.1276,4.2742,5.3112,3.7254,11.2366,5.1103,2.1372,6.1002,0.7947,2.0979,2.107,5.57,2.2724,8.3948,3.4626,0.727,5.4901,4.2884,1.3629,7.6419,5.1442,0.3158,1.0641,0.3204,1.5827,1.6854,5.0007,3.8393,4.449,2.387,4.5161,0.1142,0.9273,5.6371,2.7008,3.2263,4.7496,2.9447,3.3778,0.7304,0.5838,1.4154,3.7456,1.1354,1.6295,6.0524,1.4046,2.8285,2.0142,3.3704,3.5912,2.8691,3.2666,2.2422,1.2926,2.6719,3.414,6.5655,1.6836,1.4572,5.9941,2.8122,1.8344,4.5987,4.944,4.0441,1.3152,1.8313,2.1619,2.4533,5.5467,3.7478,5.2216,7.8044,2.1677,0.1216,8.1888,1.7318,1.5899,1.3815,4.0979,5.0775,3.8159,4.5292,2.733,1.108,1.1852,2.1556,1.3325,1.6883,4.326,1.3129,4.0396,1.2775,2.3165,3.2724,7.2225,2.8204,6.0459,2.5239,4.5826,1.8413,2.1903,4.1659,0.1517,3.0572,3.1656,1.4825,0.2964,1.0643,0.6285,2.6208,1.9418,4.9568,4.6778,5.0218,0.5717,0.6354,3.4573,0.8347,2.4134,2.4492,3.3552,2.9661,4.7036,0.9452,3.7547,1.0288,0.9756,3.3547,5.2017,2.1475,2.4021,3.4896,6.7481,1.5806,2.3052,4.8188,0.0265,0.3094,5.8834,1.3074,2.1162,0.4957,4.4231,6.1561,1.4981,1.1997,1.9317,2.6788,3.8818,4.2764,0.587,5.1845,4.4362,7.0763,0.338,1.9378,3.1327,3.0589,2.4135,1.0907,0.0274,5.7084,4.3185,4.3589,1.4722,4.4555,1.6838,0.123,0.9728,4.9424,3.9878,1.7384,0.4464,3.6907,4.1438,3.308,0.7339,1.9281,0.365,4.2607,3.1366,2.1068,1.1473,1.5017,3.5019,4.1903,0.7173,0.3993,2.8306,0.2522,6.3611,3.2375,0.6942,2.0112,1.7629,0.9184,0.6183,5.4845,1.8895,3.5785,2.7581,0.9866,4.1822,0.1939,1.5726,2.1264,0.4908,1.3735,0.2961,0.5782,1.7883,3.1894,3.7633,4.682,4.4639,3.5508,9.3343,0.0381,1.6181,3.6755,3.231,3.5666,2.0311,0.6704,1.5742,2.4397,0.6163,1.7385,0.7621,1.8648,5.4434,1.1854,3.629,1.6053,1.2434,2.1517,4.1444,2.8282,0.1138,2.4339,1.4266,3.1899,4.5889,3.2331,2.6802,6.1864,1.4608,4.5702,3.2567,0.9996,0.0571,2.1304,7.3748,0.357,3.0914,2.8981,3.8498,2.7328,1.2752,7.972,2.2643,0.9712,6.6085,3.1194,0.1471,2.8229,5.1916,1.0736,6.1685,4.6411,1.8249,1.398,3.522,1.8048,4.7313,2.4252,3.8546,1.2445,7.5866,2.2279,5.6351,4.7713,0.8872,2.9287,1.9869,7.18,1.5277,3.4435,4.7047,3.49,3.2541,3.7271,6.9939,3.053,2.632,1.6112,0.9898,1.8378,0.1686,1.6568,6.4127,2.7492,4.1986,0.3348,4.5943,2.4435,1.4113,1.6477,1.4514,2.5684,0.6291,1.82,6.1918,0.7375,3.4283,2.1944,0.194,2.7644,1.8745,1.6676,1.1993,0.6858,1.2189,2.417,0.9975,3.8115,4.8497,1.0041,2.3837,3.6773,6.5774,1.0279,9.8273,2.3641,1.3723,0.5282,2.0896,2.8037,0.1046,3.6631,4.184,1.6606,0.2767,0.8647,0.3501,0.7805,2.1212,3.6603,5.4697,2.7365,5.8607,8.5118,2.9566,3.9692,1.3369,1.5055,2.8096,4.6177,3.8118,1.1511,0.8981,3.7982,0.7933,5.0641,0.0082,0.1197,1.2056,5.1762,1.5908,2.8171,3.5188,2.378,1.8671,0.7882,0.4721,0.1818,1.6399,2.8132,4.643,3.5595,5.0699,4.1665,0.6011,1.1926,0.5084,2.7729,0.0853,1.7987,1.0228,0.7048,1.6242,1.1263,1.6663,0.6846,1.4375,4.8684,0.712,1.563,1.7612,1.2893,0.4732,3.1811,1.9464,3.6888,1.8177,5.1489,2.4973,3.544,5.0754,4.324,2.4282,5.3865,1.6137,0.7223,2.8451,5.3394,6.6308,6.0642,0.0402,0.9058,8.4357,1.2254,1.3415,1.3146,4.2017,3.3584,6.0512,3.6395,1.8921,3.448,2.3356,2.599,1.7077,2.6997,1.4108,2.2193,2.7781,0.2488,5.0566,1.9491,2.763,2.9716,3.4204,7.2097,1.6402,6.0958,0.0358,0.636,5.1418,0.0837,2.4203,2.9086,1.8495,2.3208,2.0174,0.4036,5.4257,1.1263,4.721,1.6617,0.2249,1.0953,0.6582,0.7422,1.5247,0.7208,1.4547,0.9141,0.5822,5.4983,5.079,2.0871,4.3156,0.195,0.2954,2.9316,3.7942,0.0021,4.9115,1.4455,0.1546,3.5873,2.3346,0.101,0.1897,1.4385,1.0366,2.3201,5.8364,0.3379,0.033,3.9232,1.1202,0.744,3.1363,4.3718,2.5134,4.1294,2.0267,0.8334,0.2423,0.0154,0.67,3.8239,1.8484,2.4128,1.0339,1.08,2.319,2.8653,6.209,2.0243,0.1275,0.7078,1.8216,0.8562,3.8818,1.9936,0.222,1.9196,5.2602,3.1282,6.9587,3.8564,3.4831,3.4276,0.6936,2.2462,3.9884,4.4376,1.1547,3.2806,1.8595,0.2607,1.2262,1.938,5.3336,4.0626,1.2605,1.1733,2.9023,3.5766,2.666,2.6587,6.4474,1.2511,0.0015,1.1795,4.115,2.1348,3.1688,6.8998,3.3595,1.3654,5.1211,1.7561,1.3831,3.6658,1.5446,2.5595,2.7404,4.3268,4.1548,3.278,0.1485,2.1842,1.7075,4.5367,1.5431,1.4659,4.5556,0.2382,0.5529,3.7531,1.5319,1.1915,4.3505,5.4838,4.0256,0.2739,3.318,1.8059,2.7381,3.0088,2.6705,0.1789,0.0557,2.6268,2.4369,1.8621,8.1799,0.9351,5.0739,1.4643,2.6994,0.1446,4.6341,2.5197,4.1553,5.01,0.4339,0.8894,1.549,4.7427,1.2352,4.91,0.9358,1.9386]}

{"prompt":"Theories for why T.Rex had such small hands . Perhaps a time traveller has gone back in time to see and is surprised .","text":"Theories for why T.Rex had such small hands. Perhaps a time traveller has gone back in time to see and is surprised. It is impossible to understand how our hands and arms work. I mean we understand how our legs and feet work. For example why we can speak. But can the way our hands and arms work\nWhen we are angry and upset. We are not happy. But our brain says no. Its a warning. You could be doing something to cause another person is problems. When people get upset sometimes you can see their bodies start to tense. The muscle in the front between the shoulders. You would not normally see a person doing that unless they were upset. Is the same as muscle tension in our neck and shoulders. When our body is tense we do not listen. Tensions and other emotions can keep us from being able to express our thoughts and feelings to another. But sometimes when we hurt it hurts hard all over you can feel it. Often you will not feel the pain if you are not looking at it. But the anger and tension inside is there. And this is still very hard to release. Maybe your family has given you something that has upset you? Or perhaps you have given someone a gift that upset them? This type of anger is different from the physical ones. The physical types need to be handled with drugs and sometimes surgery. I can show you the signs we should be concerned about if someone is not happy about something. The main difference between physical and emotional anger is that when they do a physical action for me to stop them from doing something that annoys me the anger disappears. But when they use anger and verbal abuse to stop me from doing something that I don\u2019t want to do the anger goes away. I have been told by a doctor that sometimes when people do not understand anger they think something is wrong with them. When anger does go away sometimes it takes a long time, and sometimes people end up more angry. I have also heard many good stories about people who used to have anger problems and they are not angry anymore.\nThe anger that I speak of is a normal emotional response. I know it sounds like that you are doing something to upset me. But that is just not the case. I can tell you that I never do anything to upset anyone. But then my body says no. Or we all know what I have just said. But most of us do have anger problems even if we say we do not. Often times we do the unpleasant things and we go to someone and tell them we do not want to do it. That is anger and verbal abuse. But in all of this there is one thing we can\u2019t do. No matter what the other person has done, we should not say we do not want to do it. If people were told they can\u2019t say I do not want to do something, they would not have done that many times. The only thing that makes us angry is the actions of the person doing it to us.\nYou could have a small disagreement with someone. Let them know they are doing it wrong. And let them know you do not want to make the same mistake. When people are upset they have other thoughts. We all have to be able to express their feeling and how they are feeling. We don\u2019t have to be angry.","token_len":681,"entropy":[11.0938,4.0583,3.3097,7.4402,3.6107,4.3855,4.2987,3.2078,7.2166,2.8641,2.6904,5.8898,4.2164,6.2347,5.3588,5.1511,5.0535,2.5786,0.576,0.0035,1.0327,2.1605,5.9074,7.4185,4.8809,3.6647,3.5869,1.6434,5.0404,0.2939,5.4252,2.1932,6.4125,6.4503,3.2969,4.5205,3.8957,1.4343,3.7583,4.8802,3.5291,6.6848,1.9679,2.0203,3.8671,2.7426,1.8171,0.3473,1.0135,5.5988,1.5319,6.6555,2.6758,2.3188,5.8308,2.4118,3.5418,4.7901,4.4664,4.8885,1.5247,1.5376,1.6371,0.7421,0.6505,7.6817,8.7984,1.6267,2.0216,6.6918,3.0306,2.7885,2.795,1.9297,2.1948,2.3135,3.7608,0.8157,3.1626,3.3842,5.6459,3.8002,4.1427,0.896,6.0543,4.7418,5.6587,1.0346,4.8145,4.3052,2.3069,4.5524,0.6138,2.7803,3.5469,5.2092,0.5978,8.1808,11.7111,0.7435,4.6936,4.0552,3.3286,1.271,6.5433,3.54,2.0687,3.4191,3.3711,7.0263,4.9967,0.2669,5.6759,2.2363,3.3346,6.6376,3.0828,1.8553,4.4376,8.4304,1.369,4.3622,3.3424,3.1904,4.3353,2.7996,4.3324,1.115,2.3802,2.1997,3.9717,1.8754,4.9704,0.9256,0.7666,3.5539,0.6217,6.2575,3.2298,5.1405,4.662,10.3367,1.2071,1.8485,3.5766,3.3417,2.752,1.9641,0.9981,3.4223,3.3019,2.4206,1.1016,2.9571,1.7057,3.6202,0.2357,7.2229,1.3506,6.438,4.259,3.8866,5.2719,3.0887,2.5722,5.7637,0.4755,0.8201,2.5834,1.3492,0.0031,3.8553,1.1451,2.4668,1.4514,0.5652,4.4252,3.3231,1.1477,3.7705,4.2937,2.7675,0.5045,6.8212,4.5873,3.7538,7.0511,7.6329,1.7558,7.3837,4.4417,1.8117,1.3756,0.7617,5.9962,3.0279,2.3209,2.4184,2.3483,2.3522,0.7292,4.1458,0.375,1.4103,1.7878,4.3096,0.9647,1.2072,0.5078,3.0794,3.4292,4.0369,1.8634,4.1568,5.0995,3.6764,2.7185,0.8301,3.3551,3.7389,0.9233,7.0787,3.679,3.3026,0.8487,6.0428,0.5358,5.5381,3.1067,4.6652,2.7375,5.2309,0.2784,2.6266,2.6343,3.833,4.4907,0.4393,4.0162,2.7683,3.0674,0.9672,1.2371,4.5994,3.1904,2.1208,3.4149,1.5975,4.438,2.4347,1.517,3.6829,5.5584,0.028,1.428,1.5885,5.0587,0.8555,1.9692,5.0045,4.1032,0.6137,2.827,2.5776,5.2159,6.0267,0.7192,0.8998,5.2156,1.6172,9.0151,1.6815,4.9341,6.4597,0.6475,4.0575,3.82,5.3769,0.1562,2.5835,4.6747,6.339,5.0076,2.0288,4.5792,0.4684,3.5058,3.9773,0.9434,3.5947,2.9912,3.3963,1.7582,0.6309,3.0252,6.3859,3.9815,1.3552,2.4624,1.0099,0.2946,0.7235,0.3588,1.2242,2.8062,3.8594,3.332,4.4606,1.859,3.6578,5.5228,5.2239,3.1352,3.4149,2.6522,1.7473,1.4437,1.6126,2.8589,6.0759,0.0426,0.8568,3.403,1.7732,5.8895,0.3527,3.0979,0.7231,0.6969,4.5383,4.0368,3.0741,8.1267,0.9514,1.6357,2.5632,0.6003,0.2741,0.3317,0.3647,1.1823,2.8367,3.2224,17.0843,7.6467,2.062,0.7641,0.6583,0.203,3.2045,0.8203,3.0728,0.2956,0.3004,3.4891,2.95,2.5973,2.221,2.0682,2.8984,1.8804,0.5256,4.9557,2.0403,3.2141,2.4946,4.3155,3.4508,4.1285,1.3556,4.2868,4.7091,0.8848,0.2374,1.8584,0.4839,0.4177,3.5472,4.651,3.6216,2.593,0.0113,3.9866,1.2727,4.3965,1.5447,2.009,0.0239,4.0223,2.4977,1.8095,3.9309,5.9179,0.0233,6.7168,1.1842,1.3756,2.9303,1.5879,3.7252,1.6585,4.0595,5.966,2.0136,0.8916,1.0771,0.5568,3.9614,0.9261,2.8067,2.278,2.5515,1.999,2.5377,3.3312,2.7133,3.9367,0.8156,0.2074,4.4924,2.8471,4.191,2.3666,3.2711,6.6394,0.878,1.2275,3.2359,4.0646,4.2674,1.6128,0.9501,2.7004,3.5762,2.2138,4.5342,2.0134,4.6524,4.7933,1.8751,4.1382,0.7396,1.8361,2.4132,3.1719,1.0729,0.7009,3.3273,0.4847,3.8422,2.4061,1.6418,0.7486,0.1538,2.43,3.3023,1.5488,0.1424,0.861,2.7834,4.9959,3.5516,1.5403,0.8371,0.6673,2.3129,0.5329,3.289,4.8707,3.9701,2.9159,3.4504,1.4391,0.7411,5.9321,4.5426,3.6784,2.4742,2.2732,3.0084,3.1845,4.0481,0.4588,0.4305,2.448,5.7312,0.9391,1.2898,2.206,5.1245,1.9191,0.4805,6.3248,1.6869,0.3653,5.6031,3.2406,1.6063,0.207,1.4635,5.7361,3.6462,1.4885,2.0577,4.8607,7.9626,0.8411,2.9808,2.1478,4.4648,1.6507,5.9318,2.1292,2.7314,0.0675,2.4173,1.5708,0.2385,1.2103,0.3919,0.7296,1.9737,0.422,3.8453,0.7456,5.9454,2.7935,6.5577,0.0495,0.374,2.5468,4.2108,4.2973,2.1667,1.4694,2.8034,0.4742,4.0962,0.8276,2.0928,1.8732,11.9375,0.4814,0.4602,1.5064,0.6365,5.6291,1.9017,0.7316,2.9817,4.1469,0.2753,3.6828,0.902,1.6642,1.1766,2.466,1.6454,3.2698,3.0935,0.8235,0.1795,0.1198,0.1293,0.3615,0.5471,0.2306,2.9189,5.046,4.6563,5.5672,3.0442,2.6962,6.5327,0.1371,0.0244,1.5637,4.8378,0.8132,0.1127,0.0479,0.0619,0.1391,2.0227,2.0816,1.9151,0.2454,1.4539,2.9587,2.1911,1.5985,8.1749,0.8249,0.5294,3.372,2.5676,1.7076,1.1586,3.713,1.5647,0.9197,0.2619,1.9312,5.0172,1.5338,2.2026,2.2164,3.5717,1.5174,3.8024,0.7777,0.2011,3.0729,4.157,3.4128,3.2768,1.6291,5.4582,6.9049,0.904,1.239,1.7641,5.711,1.2143,3.0624,2.597,1.3607,2.9131,1.9139,2.5315,0.7218,3.4631,2.4338,0.2956,1.3774,2.0557,1.7899,0.1161,0.2063,0.2383,5.2797,3.1484,2.137,0.552,0.8777,4.0245,2.4411,1.8212,1.9174,1.4414,3.4546,4.8201,2.6303,1.2211,4.0074,3.3073,0.9683,4.5081,2.3825,2.557,0.0014,1.8131,5.2234,7.5259,1.897,4.8893,1.1243,2.9549,0.3511,0.4789,2.5474,3.416,0.6629,0.2321,0.0012,1.0527,0.376,1.6793,2.0449,1.4796]}
{"prompt":"You \u2019 re a regular at Starbucks . This time you go , the lady writes `` RUN '' on your takeaway cup .","text":"You \u2019 re a regular at Starbucks. This time you go, the lady writes `` RUN '' on your takeaway cup. She wants you to read it. And you do, and it means something she never said in a Starbucks and she wants you to understand why she was so upset by your error of judgment. By the time you read it, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not there, and you miss out on learning to recognize emotions. Instead, you read it as the angry girl, who made a big mistake that you might have done, but shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you missed out on: the emotion. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about emotions. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid of emotional feelings. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried you might have one. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to control your way of reacting to emotional situations of people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re scared that your emotions are not acceptable ( unrealistic ). Then this will not work. You need to be brave enough to go out of your comfort zone and be vulnerable. That includes, accepting and showing your emotions so the person you are speaking with doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an emo bunny. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hide, do not block, accept, and say the right words at the right time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about relationships. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to show, say and accept. This is your ticket to success. Let me help. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your first mistake, let me be your guide. All you need to do is show up, and show me the emotion that you want me to help you express. I want you back. You can change. Start now. Contact me.\nThis is a short video of my interview with a local radio station. The interview was recorded this week (9\/17\/2014), the radio show airs during the week about once a month.\nThe interviews were recorded during my time in Japan in August, at my hotel in the city outside Tokyo, called Kajiura.\nI'm currently finishing a book on my travels. I've been thinking of starting the book after my next trip abroad; either to Europe or the United States.\nI was born in a family of authors. I have a sister who is a freelance writer. My other family members are doctors.\nSo, from day one, I was destined to become a writer. As a child, I loved to read. I wanted to be an author as a writer had always been my dream.\nMy first novel, Taro, was published in November 2015. My second, Taro and the Puzzle of the Dead City, was published in May 2016.

{"prompt":"Rain now shimmers as it falls . You witness the first severe thunderstorm since the phenomenon began .","text":"Rain now shimmers as it falls. You witness the first severe thunderstorm since the phenomenon began. It seems as if time has slowed down. As the rain picks up, it begins to get more intense. The lightning begins to strike more frequently. Every time the lightning does, it illuminates the sky. Rain begins to fall with a greater intensity as the storm clouds begin to tear.\nThere are some beautiful creatures in this world that I love. And that doesn\u2019t mean frogs or insects. I\u2019m talking about my mother. She\u2019s my world. As the world outside of her dwindles, it starts to show on her face. People tell that women are more emotional. I guess we are. But when your world is dwindling, your face shows it in spades.\nThere are so many things out there that I love. And that doesn\u2019t mean only the beautiful. I\u2019m talking about my daughter. She\u2019s my world. She has completely changed my life in so many ways that if the first were to be a sentence, it would probably end with \u201cshe has completely changed my life\u201d. But when I can\u2019t look at her because I have cancer, it makes me feel like my world is almost down to zero. But it doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t because she is with me; her love for me is as strong as any love I can have.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. I have felt this same frustration with my husband about my cancer treatment. When we first found out about this cancer, there were a lot of bad feelings that came up about my treatment. And the frustration about this was what initially brought us together. As a wedding couple, our love was all about our wedding day. And so in that day, our love was strong. After my cancer treatment, the feelings that came up about my treatment brought us together. It\u2019s because those feelings made us realize that we were still together and that we had a beautiful adventure to come ahead.\nThat\u2019s what I love about my husband\u2026we\u2019ve been married over 20 years, and we still love each other like we did the day we got married. When I get frustrated that I still have to go into chemotherapy because it\u2019s a choice I\u2019ve made, there\u2019s a feeling of frustration. But it doesn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s because I\u2019m reminded that my husband is going to follow me through any choice I\u2019ve made in my life. That\u2019s what I love about my husband.\nI love my children, my family. Even when things are going smoothly I always strive to do my best for them. And even when I struggle, I know I have a strong family by my side. I know they will always love me. So when I feel frustrated about my cancer treatment, that frustration quickly passes. When I feel overwhelmed by the thought of this treatment, I\u2019m reminded that my children will support me. And they will love me. There are a lot of beautiful reasons to be frustrated about my cancer treatment. But when I realize that it is my family that keeps me going, that frustration quickly passes. And I can get my head up again.","token_len":683,"entropy":[7.5637,8.9293,3.1021,3.5909,1.8071,4.6319,1.991,4.5096,8.8021,1.1903,4.9354,9.1723,3.4539,0.2988,3.5448,1.3407,10.6575,1.0731,0.9829,2.2465,3.6342,2.5769,0.6162,6.6668,0.8079,2.5838,0.937,1.3953,3.9322,1.5915,2.8466,5.6089,0.0545,0.6241,2.0433,2.8863,0.2267,5.3052,2.743,1.5004,0.4986,1.9412,3.7612,3.6107,0.2003,3.5369,4.0932,2.0864,1.007,6.2309,2.1419,1.892,0.7231,4.9263,2.108,1.174,8.3644,0.002,0.0004,0.9732,2.6283,1.0086,6.3511,2.7752,0.144,1.5822,5.5494,2.1755,5.9913,1.8236,2.594,1.6137,2.6225,5.637,2.1507,0.0722,6.4442,2.8269,2.5537,7.7114,0.9795,3.9462,5.1999,6.2645,2.0393,1.8784,1.5427,2.1372,3.8045,3.7851,0.8343,4.7684,3.9077,5.2305,15.7604,7.9838,1.1525,1.3537,11.7563,2.4524,4.6906,1.0389,2.1925,4.0632,0.252,0.528,4.3456,0.2033,4.7791,4.6849,1.2881,2.4745,2.0519,0.2377,0.5385,2.1086,6.247,0.904,4.6171,2.5458,4.6982,6.5336,1.8894,3.2811,8.0634,0.0101,0.6615,2.7505,4.038,0.1215,4.9982,5.3915,2.0287,1.0016,0.4492,6.0143,4.6689,6.5235,7.4339,1.5548,3.508,6.2741,2.6123,2.0516,5.1142,4.6065,1.9977,1.2413,2.5074,3.9268,4.7468,2.8576,1.5694,6.9694,0.507,2.6072,4.0861,4.1381,4.0418,3.6171,6.7502,0.0957,0.1288,1.7602,3.4516,0.8243,3.3593,0.0192,2.0592,4.7638,0.0532,0.6308,1.3197,3.0269,0.9512,2.2366,1.3906,0.9321,0.0277,0.0206,0.0009,0.0023,7.8812,2.638,3.2699,1.6009,1.5318,1.9408,0.1664,0.0536,0.1205,0.038,1.1601,5.5451,0.3731,1.0499,1.5307,0.0571,0.0067,0.2892,0.7364,0.0969,2.3776,2.7726,7.6915,0.9586,2.0815,0.4661,3.7832,3.3449,0.133,0.3784,3.3485,5.6732,4.4222,5.6498,8.5547,1.0397,3.0532,4.6464,7.7474,0.56,1.0813,0.3071,3.204,3.2738,2.4429,7.0165,4.8818,5.2601,6.5608,2.7962,0.0678,0.4707,0.2139,3.776,7.5515,1.759,3.1338,3.2111,2.2088,5.9922,2.3181,0.7615,0.0202,4.6879,1.0802,0.392,4.9825,1.9514,2.1948,9.091,0.5773,2.5572,3.3781,0.3795,1.3661,1.9586,3.4262,2.6542,0.5064,5.6,7.5786,2.6072,2.8932,0.2168,3.8557,3.433,1.9132,0.4414,0.1759,0.0007,3.9689,1.1228,2.0446,0.2006,0.1748,0.0032,6.0908,1.5031,1.4029,6.3715,0.3964,6.49,4.1292,4.7527,1.7038,0.1221,0.9356,4.4948,1.2822,0.1307,2.9391,3.5398,1.0059,3.2481,2.4805,0.4211,1.1962,3.9627,4.3291,1.9047,0.3114,1.207,0.8698,1.6371,1.6053,1.494,2.254,6.7065,2.4837,5.9534,6.7476,3.3515,0.978,6.2116,5.4581,2.1861,5.3565,4.576,0.9363,3.6961,2.3225,1.9895,6.1822,0.453,1.5486,2.5651,3.3565,0.9516,4.5736,1.4276,2.4564,0.514,0.0112,5.7954,3.1219,2.6288,2.2831,1.7924,2.3294,2.4866,2.0681,0.3679,2.7438,3.7102,5.9212,5.1413,2.3756,2.1596,5.3567,8.0954,3.6838,1.9569,0.623,0.3783,4.5927,2.4906,7.4462,4.0513,0.2649,3.3516,3.0257,2.4964,5.2969,0.4515,2.1107,2.293,1.8134,0.4646,2.0521,3.6181,4.7028,2.6475,3.7883,0.3591,2.9122,1.9707,1.6534,5.6078,1.2185,6.2737,3.5481,1.7173,1.0309,0.3236,3.3059,5.0257,2.4219,1.5244,1.2467,0.8374,1.011,2.1761,6.5653,0.6738,0.6676,0.6216,3.1699,4.7721,0.1032,0.627,3.7428,6.495,0.3354,3.6094,0.77,2.3424,0.3876,1.4329,1.3592,4.404,1.557,2.1318,0.8391,0.736,2.207,2.228,4.3471,9.6337,2.1283,5.0558,8.9601,3.104,1.1566,3.7837,6.4905,0.074,0.2126,1.8168,2.0555,2.4563,0.5119,1.3716,1.179,6.3003,5.9171,4.7734,1.1447,1.9622,1.5785,3.4055,5.2797,3.9546,0.0942,2.8045,0.5966,1.3573,3.2398,2.1705,0.1263,0.0211,4.3174,1.2931,1.6389,3.5433,2.8777,1.1211,3.0005,0.7623,0.1713,4.2354,1.4579,3.0627,7.4279,4.0298,1.1263,5.197,0.9265,1.6778,2.7348,4.8259,2.6754,4.0605,3.0735,2.2405,0.0598,0.0898,2.8353,6.8212,1.9213,6.4528,0.1008,2.2521,0.0929,0.4687,4.7643,1.7619,0.0309,0.3171,1.7944,4.2493,1.0152,5.3934,2.0462,2.3365,2.328,1.9872,0.1538,0.0178,0.0058,8.809,1.1751,0.4314,2.1915,2.2205,0.0241,0.0131,2.9932,1.4808,4.436,0.047,0.499,7.33,1.4544,2.6734,1.3346,1.4222,3.6563,0.613,6.9598,2.97,1.4627,5.2156,5.8038,1.911,3.2436,0.0192,0.4944,0.013,3.9569,1.739,0.1842,0.3864,3.1952,1.6446,0.0103,0.0816,0.9203,1.0542,1.0544,0.0757,0.4284,0.1881,0.4319,1.0382,1.8619,2.5076,1.473,4.5047,2.1877,1.9502,2.7531,1.4064,5.4511,2.1972,4.2585,1.5701,1.7066,5.4198,6.2453,4.3918,6.3872,0.3103,2.7307,2.2137,0.0857,3.2144,0.5405,0.2773,2.0459,4.0177,0.251,2.3552,4.6809,1.8053,0.4811,4.2906,1.8724,1.5984,1.9321,4.0831,2.5123,7.6411,0.5678,0.0135,0.1995,1.7662,2.1791,3.3806,1.9187,1.7267,1.7515,0.14,1.3001,4.3691,1.6106,0.9174,1.8476,2.3941,2.4481,0.857,1.7848,0.2771,0.215,3.0093,4.6417,6.2747,6.2078,0.6533,3.5109,0.5255,0.9205,4.0465,1.4991,1.3151,4.4703,0.2651,4.5133,3.8052,0.3443,1.3814,4.6392,0.0957,0.7535,2.0327,0.5732,1.7159,3.548,1.6818,7.9795,0.1625,2.2928,1.6236,3.2285,0.4229,3.501,0.1478,0.8622,6.0496,1.5664,3.2178,0.1731,0.029,3.3441,6.4881,2.0206,1.8045,2.8689,1.3167,1.1853,0.6491,0.123,0.3394,1.8385,2.5071,0.9848,4.5155,0.4045,3.028,1.365,1.8681,2.7354,0.9091,5.2635,0.2429,0.9807,0.4504,1.2248,8.6297,2.0483,0.4285,0.2106,2.4568,2.2808,2.9383,5.0066,3.8404,4.1187,4.8071,5.2229,1.0705]}
{"prompt":"When time-traveling became possible , the government was forced to stop people from actually making changes in the past , that could alter the present . You are part of the corps that protects time and your task is it to stop people from killing Hitler","text":"When time-traveling became possible, the government was forced to stop people from actually making changes in the past, that could alter the present. You are part of the corps that protects time and your task is it to stop people from killing Hitler. You can only kill Hitler if you time travel to the event before he is actually born and you kill him before he has a chance to make his mistake. (I don\u2019t think anyone knew the future could change or that Hitler\u2019s mother would die. I do think the future Hitler was born into was altered, but I can\u2019t remember for the life of me where I read this. )\nI couldn\u2019t help myself when I read this. I fell in love with the writing and characters. The books are easy to read but the stories are just as intense as most other books out there in the horror genre. You see, the characters are not a typical group of military men. They are young people out for adventure and have the same problems as teenagers do. They don\u2019t seem to have life and are definitely not perfect. They have big problems they can\u2019t get out of no matter what they do, they just haven\u2019t figured out what to do yet.\nThe men who are trying to make a change in the past seem to make a similar mistake. The most notable of these men is called George and he is a good listener. This is important because George seems to have a unique perception of life and he can make you feel better very quickly.\nLuke comes from an entirely different place. He\u2019s an ex-cops but he\u2019s lost his family, so he hasn\u2019t been to the mall, movies, or parties in awhile. Luke has big shoes to fill but is learning to live with his past and figure out what he wants.\nI\u2019m pretty sure I read this book in the late 1990\u2019s. I had never heard of the author but after reading this book, I was in love with it. The author never uses clich\u00e9s or stereotypes so the book is easy to read and enjoyable. The writing is clean and easy to understand. I remember reading this book many a few times but I never reread it. When last I read it, I believe, I gave it to my younger self then and told her, \u201cWhen you grow up, you have to reread this book. I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s in the world and I thank you for writing it. This book is as important today as it was back in the 1990\u2019s.\nAfter reading this book, I wanted to read the sequel. I went and bought the copy, but I\u2019m still not sure I read it. I am sure it is in my TBR pile and I\u2019ll get it someday.\nOverall : 5-stars. The story is fast paced and interesting with a great premise. The characters are fascinating and easy to root for. I love reading these books because they never feel like you are reading a copy of teenage novel. They feel real and I love spending time with the characters as they figure things out in the future. There is a great message behind this book, but it never gets clunky. It\u2019s always clean and easy to pick up.","token_len":685,"entropy":[6.7018,5.5284,2.679,0.9562,7.3262,3.1143,0.5037,1.7694,6.1484,2.9427,2.7273,0.0701,4.5453,6.4529,0.5128,5.769,3.8557,5.2186,1.8168,1.7192,4.2031,1.8511,6.0733,4.3564,4.4991,1.0163,2.7572,0.789,6.3021,4.8378,6.1503,0.0334,0.8761,12.8968,2.5132,6.3852,6.3402,2.3293,4.3737,6.9513,0.4891,8.9407,0.5113,2.8152,2.3887,0.5287,7.0171,11.1152,1.1286,2.5634,2.7464,3.6608,3.8037,1.901,1.2945,0.5156,9.1131,0.3134,2.3362,0.9573,7.8426,3.323,2.5042,3.1124,3.7939,2.9255,2.8884,2.2996,3.6495,0.5089,3.0018,0.4995,3.3558,1.8633,0.3674,0.1165,3.6407,1.9906,7.072,0.2838,5.0948,4.0321,3.1051,15.3381,10.0646,0.8717,1.974,3.6018,5.3259,2.8684,5.3731,4.786,3.5261,4.1052,2.8976,3.2718,5.6452,0.4125,0.3979,5.1248,1.1647,3.411,3.2661,1.9704,4.0655,1.1401,2.7666,2.612,10.5144,2.1549,1.524,4.1551,4.3589,6.0602,2.3431,1.0421,1.1494,3.3138,1.5826,0.1452,0.0035,2.3578,5.9756,5.3687,4.5448,0.18,0.0245,4.1631,1.5816,5.6283,2.8798,2.9787,4.7147,1.0265,4.681,5.8501,0.4332,0.1972,0.0005,3.5977,2.8893,2.9964,0.5227,2.6885,1.276,1.3308,1.6342,7.764,1.3285,0.0176,0.126,1.5655,5.6594,1.7335,5.0839,1.6528,2.4012,6.1265,2.1477,6.1578,0.2263,0.4331,3.0782,1.7318,3.1571,0.7324,4.6638,2.9051,5.1866,3.6159,5.4962,3.0243,2.1098,3.9931,0.0141,4.198,1.0273,6.6865,0.1299,0.193,4.4504,3.6716,1.8244,1.7969,3.843,1.0847,3.0709,4.7133,5.0392,4.1084,0.212,7.8229,2.3212,1.6493,0.8812,0.4898,5.2065,3.3241,6.7292,2.8833,4.351,1.5336,4.867,4.0427,2.9611,4.0383,0.6177,6.4052,4.3012,0.4604,1.4592,3.2195,0.2605,0.335,0.0011,4.3413,0.6097,1.5556,6.908,3.9977,3.3442,7.5003,0.4147,5.2949,0.6648,1.8616,2.0414,6.5915,1.2387,5.3689,2.5701,5.3748,0.0318,0.0018,4.4692,3.3226,0.0618,8.7228,1.041,0.3798,2.1002,0.7086,1.8176,2.062,2.8172,5.8249,0.1493,0.13,0.0783,3.3436,0.2625,2.2284,1.1278,0.0274,4.2786,0.2558,2.6199,2.3342,7.0935,3.332,1.6368,4.9539,0.0343,3.0776,2.3887,1.7688,0.912,0.7014,0.7293,4.0965,0.9789,5.1406,2.0193,5.1228,0.7951,1.1012,2.2392,4.8178,3.9078,1.6661,0.8728,1.2364,0.516,6.2229,7.4758,4.3002,0.8792,0.7742,1.5589,4.5553,7.8304,0.938,4.4972,1.1421,4.8136,0.5531,3.0944,3.8089,0.2171,1.5838,1.3047,4.9115,5.9397,0.2529,4.3102,1.2522,2.8546,3.2575,3.0455,4.0523,1.2833,3.5753,8.548,0.3337,0.5288,2.6912,11.1862,5.5605,1.7166,2.553,4.8395,0.0428,2.7061,0.9703,0.8007,4.9033,0.3171,0.0109,2.3841,4.6295,0.1913,6.0367,3.3253,7.1418,0.7793,2.3276,0.0231,0.0213,7.8383,1.0421,2.989,2.7943,4.5806,0.399,5.6869,0.067,0.0391,0.1977,2.0595,4.7239,1.8988,5.8418,2.7861,8.6365,0.8088,1.4173,6.1048,3.0136,5.1755,0.3785,4.1008,2.197,7.5473,5.3689,0.0019,0.0017,2.1315,3.9489,6.8847,1.4414,1.9403,0.6192,1.8166,2.499,1.266,5.809,0.396,1.1938,1.3238,1.4326,3.0394,1.6542,2.4274,4.6101,0.0465,0.5325,4.6323,0.453,3.0806,5.0728,1.6203,1.7442,2.971,1.7045,3.5945,2.7121,7.69,0.0377,0.0085,1.1466,1.2011,3.6171,2.2954,1.7243,0.3757,1.983,4.5029,2.4527,5.0872,0.5049,1.2297,0.7878,1.7038,0.2807,2.2941,4.3461,1.9293,0.5815,1.1135,0.3576,2.7109,3.9321,6.4124,6.7629,4.7835,0.0035,1.5767,3.1606,4.7281,3.5817,2.3769,1.1604,3.0514,0.0603,0.6486,0.9904,4.846,0.7987,1.8132,3.609,0.4728,5.1112,0.3907,3.2264,0.0253,1.4049,0.8507,2.1036,5.4401,1.3324,1.239,0.2138,5.5162,6.0225,7.9504,0.7011,3.0611,1.3017,1.887,6.6574,0.3313,0.1772,0.9817,4.3211,10.3148,0.2082,0.6195,0.9487,0.7225,0.3404,7.003,5.4621,0.8791,5.2797,0.54,3.0107,1.5108,4.7308,1.9775,7.6085,3.5399,7.3544,2.4551,3.0057,9.1158,6.1415,7.027,2.1427,6.0301,0.0934,0.6626,0.8069,3.0482,0.3496,6.1718,0.2069,1.9137,0.1788,1.0304,1.872,3.3124,0.0766,0.9247,3.4192,0.8928,3.5135,2.7714,0.0486,0.0862,3.5043,1.5308,6.0961,2.8939,1.3171,4.4287,0.7402,0.7232,5.0091,0.8549,0.4218,4.8253,1.0899,0.9475,5.3257,3.2575,5.2043,0.1367,0.346,0.2065,2.9357,1.2812,0.326,2.2863,4.7597,0.0028,0.0114,0.3617,1.1251,5.7206,0.3749,0.3804,0.1435,0.3857,0.3157,4.1012,0.0653,2.5784,2.627,4.528,0.99,1.216,5.0583,3.9604,1.3501,1.2875,4.9809,4.0487,1.6147,1.1477,4.1697,0.0396,1.5088,3.0874,1.5238,1.008,3.4905,5.1183,0.8127,0.612,0.8575,4.1972,2.6617,2.4575,1.5555,3.6056,2.2635,10.5365,4.5565,8.0724,2.0429,0.8574,4.277,0.0263,2.5791,3.3382,1.1067,3.9389,0.3153,1.6807,6.9595,7.872,4.7696,5.5642,2.0495,1.4317,3.4475,2.0249,0.617,5.9124,0.3306,0.7272,3.3245,3.5604,1.5395,2.2766,4.3263,0.6179,1.1393,1.4102,0.4377,5.7768,0.7764,5.799,0.0197,6.1586,0.4274,0.3414,1.9882,3.7903,4.0849,3.3246,1.3578,2.041,0.8063,6.2784,1.6047,1.0552,2.6241,0.7807,1.9132,1.0044,7.9843,0.5243,12.3919,4.0591,0.9732,2.7191,3.0383,3.5632,0.9511,4.4591,2.965,6.5582,0.3707,0.1415,2.5971,0.3827,3.7437,0.9644,5.9469,2.5473,0.0037,3.9111,1.7829,1.7493,0.1952,3.8335,0.984,1.2825,2.6574,6.8984,2.6744,1.6098,0.4933,2.8549,2.1135,1.5907,4.1728,3.0346,8.0421,1.3891,1.0279,2.1904,4.8343,0.0824,0.0195,4.3858,6.333,0.3955,1.3288,0.0185,6.3876,0.1974,0.6098]}

{"prompt":"A man on his deathbed is given the ability to go back to the past and appear to himself in order to influence decisions he regrets","text":"A man on his deathbed is given the ability to go back to the past and appear to himself in order to influence decisions he regrets. The future is altered and he must choose to ignore the past and change it, or to remain as he is and accept the consequences as he has planned before his death. If he chooses to change the past then he does so in only his own will and will only do what he considers right. This is an interesting premise in and of itself. However, this is only the story of one of the three men who will choose to make such a change, and it would be interesting to see how differently this premise would be interpreted in relation to the other two men. In this short movie a man on the way to his death in bed has two choices: one is to face his past and change what is currently happening to him there or the other to just stay as he is, knowing that he will soon be dead and that he has done the wrong thing. In his view, he will be free to have any future he desires. He decides to go back to the past before he ever met his ex-girlfriend, because he has learned the hard way that meeting her once can make it much harder to meet her again and he may never get her back. That is very interesting stuff. As a viewer, you are able to see the thoughts and feelings of the other two people who live with this man. They are all clearly influenced by the decisions that he makes in that moment, and by the choices that he has already made while he was living. The premise of an altered future is very interesting indeed, and it has led to a number of interesting endings. I have not seen all the movies associated with this series, but I would not hesitate to recommend that you see them if you are looking for good, fun horror movies.\nThis movie is similar in many ways to the previous one. A man is walking his dog when he runs into a man who was working on the side of the road and who suddenly stops in front of him. The man stops to help and tells him how awful the accident on the other side of the road was. The man that is walking is then kidnapped and the man on the other side of the road does nothing about it even though he could have called the police. He does not even tell the man next to him that he saw him being raped and abused. After going for a drink a young man has an encounter with a woman that is wearing some weird looking clothes that are not very comfortable. The girl is also a bit cold to her presence but the young man does not seem to care. A few days later the boy finds a woman who is dead on the side of the road and he is asked if he is alright. However, the police say that the story is strange and that there is no point in investigating and that the young man could have died on the other side of the road from the accident that he sees the man on the other side of the road get in. This is very interesting stuff. The movie is very well done and the acting is excellent. I have not really seen too many movies that have been made about this very disturbing subject so it is very rare to see a movie that gives the viewer exactly what they are after. The movie was originally released in 1990, and it has recently been made available on DVD.","token_len":686,"entropy":[7.3022,4.5778,2.969,4.1492,0.3469,3.1149,6.728,2.2648,7.1062,0.0255,5.6811,2.565,0.9025,1.8643,3.0267,1.5102,7.9869,1.3029,6.2946,2.3,3.3356,0.024,8.1404,5.9347,4.3763,6.0309,0.6255,2.6923,5.7629,1.874,5.8213,2.8915,2.5718,3.2718,2.8648,1.9222,6.0226,1.5151,0.4682,1.3535,4.0432,3.388,3.379,1.7143,3.9273,3.5327,3.5386,1.1155,0.6905,2.0396,4.4056,0.9684,2.9797,4.7478,1.1671,2.5483,5.8832,6.2846,4.3219,0.7287,0.2328,5.0993,1.1835,0.9574,0.2992,2.5886,1.4386,0.5951,3.627,0.6913,4.907,0.3175,2.0402,7.9005,3.2763,1.4619,3.4415,1.8167,1.8085,4.5507,2.5134,5.0527,0.9889,4.1064,1.5923,0.9722,2.871,1.4179,3.8234,2.735,4.5382,3.3458,3.7916,0.0208,0.0049,1.1666,3.4959,0.3582,3.3154,1.5441,3.0137,2.0569,7.3021,0.406,3.1662,3.4191,0.6797,3.959,3.8283,1.3623,3.8478,4.3926,0.2402,4.3013,4.558,0.3144,2.5367,2.1207,1.1633,1.6793,3.8473,0.9546,3.0388,0.1613,0.4562,1.0162,6.6505,2.6934,7.3041,1.5441,2.1308,3.3566,1.7962,3.7397,0.0009,0.9374,2.2012,1.4358,2.8428,0.9252,3.4472,2.5398,6.3061,5.1498,5.0935,1.1991,3.307,2.6868,5.346,0.3355,2.0961,0.9634,5.2242,6.531,3.2633,5.5504,1.05,1.3508,4.4291,1.9831,0.2855,5.2479,1.6787,0.9253,0.9603,3.4403,4.0406,3.2944,4.7676,1.4725,2.2586,0.2547,8.6558,2.2437,4.6184,1.8131,4.3769,6.6785,2.8845,2.0574,0.0715,0.1131,2.02,5.3803,0.5505,1.2649,1.1976,5.1212,1.0555,2.7413,1.9796,2.1818,1.1561,2.6115,3.8425,2.5542,3.6282,0.1229,0.6668,2.3698,3.4816,4.3937,1.2299,1.6649,2.5233,2.5013,4.9176,0.7619,4.7611,3.2632,3.436,1.6846,2.6211,1.6093,2.2897,4.308,0.6067,2.3015,0.6202,0.2221,0.6705,0.0596,5.1354,1.1146,4.2421,4.651,1.3432,4.7223,0.6846,0.9675,1.3386,4.0842,0.8144,2.3579,4.2904,3.3029,2.889,0.0362,0.2094,8.0078,1.7416,6.4169,4.3478,3.2827,4.3834,3.3196,1.2392,1.0605,4.139,2.5065,0.9951,2.8047,2.2145,4.7033,2.9649,2.9728,3.37,0.2946,0.4513,5.2228,1.2742,5.1598,2.2013,4.476,0.7897,4.3945,2.5518,3.7788,1.0692,1.8341,2.3456,4.3136,0.0046,1.0084,1.8511,7.0686,1.5044,0.6214,0.8812,1.1239,3.103,0.7392,4.0995,2.4682,4.8111,3.1643,2.3668,0.7102,1.3855,2.6912,1.0093,2.3221,5.5575,4.0108,0.0786,1.4482,6.1888,2.3512,0.9019,1.8612,2.3703,4.3385,1.7428,1.5941,0.9374,5.1784,1.009,2.6452,1.3079,0.5362,2.1139,4.4077,0.1552,5.491,1.781,2.1047,3.5717,2.4914,2.2158,7.2854,0.971,7.4869,4.8765,1.0738,0.844,2.0713,0.75,3.9631,1.2969,0.806,1.965,3.6227,6.4953,0.6121,1.4966,2.5863,0.0017,0.8058,6.7731,1.3018,2.8759,2.8152,2.5223,1.0885,4.2339,2.0787,4.4887,7.116,0.0125,1.0156,4.1455,0.9345,0.6199,0.9995,2.7467,4.212,3.6028,0.0165,2.0109,3.9168,0.8081,3.8854,1.4823,1.7614,0.1068,1.3988,2.8775,0.1827,6.5283,3.2731,5.0555,5.4687,0.9813,0.5148,1.3465,5.5128,1.9656,0.8818,6.3974,1.7171,2.1896,0.1535,0.1399,1.2173,3.3264,2.1534,1.6608,4.9555,1.2131,1.8512,4.7033,3.8905,0.3785,2.7798,0.6408,4.6273,0.2541,0.4907,3.0021,1.6628,3.8741,6.0133,1.5569,2.4248,5.4465,0.8167,0.6175,0.1516,2.2015,5.0611,4.317,2.2871,3.2615,0.4175,0.0064,0.3214,0.7802,0.8562,0.4422,3.5513,2.4293,3.5265,2.4351,3.2887,0.4508,4.0269,6.3131,1.7032,4.2822,6.4655,0.3223,1.8473,0.1213,0.5565,0.0473,0.0543,0.3748,1.0387,0.6622,0.1524,7.6912,2.1544,3.3003,2.9936,4.8069,6.4095,1.106,3.5015,0.602,5.6557,0.1885,0.545,0.0923,0.1378,0.0124,0.0524,5.2913,2.9425,3.3148,0.1173,5.9808,0.3945,0.5954,5.5598,0.8387,6.2852,1.3776,0.3356,1.0998,2.4222,3.2899,0.9952,1.8653,2.9535,0.4581,0.5985,7.9935,0.0957,0.0601,1.6238,0.5542,5.8109,1.5784,3.6568,3.5352,1.4999,6.9078,1.2579,4.526,6.1147,5.711,0.4571,4.6081,5.9741,5.0718,0.7095,4.4195,3.2174,2.3628,0.0652,0.7105,1.8667,2.7059,1.471,5.3371,4.7563,6.2364,3.9102,2.374,2.1485,2.7807,3.2202,3.0214,2.5949,0.9441,1.1871,4.7269,1.5016,4.5669,3.1567,3.8334,6.1625,3.2806,2.9027,8.9358,3.1383,2.3263,3.3757,0.1259,2.0625,0.323,3.2646,0.4018,1.9296,1.0036,4.462,2.3446,2.459,0.1173,1.0895,4.4917,4.4612,2.2152,1.9177,1.6434,0.7233,6.5768,3.4634,0.2875,1.0817,0.0071,0.0972,0.0157,0.9545,2.3873,2.0988,4.7716,1.8551,0.5112,2.1002,3.8231,0.5361,5.3611,0.3508,1.3552,6.1355,3.5039,0.5636,1.6099,7.2817,1.1698,6.7691,0.6538,0.9808,2.9507,0.5217,0.9443,5.1265,0.6759,3.8698,3.061,1.1374,1.2102,2.878,0.1561,4.0557,0.8971,5.374,3.3319,0.2322,2.9376,0.0086,0.0976,0.0202,0.0448,4.9759,1.1728,2.6717,3.6272,2.1209,4.8465,3.7226,2.3447,2.2825,0.4943,0.3171,0.0324,0.0523,0.0084,0.0183,7.2924,3.2914,1.5189,2.8756,1.0985,3.026,1.2146,1.7836,0.6309,1.9489,3.4278,1.7028,1.9541,2.4631,1.1488,0.8363,2.3585,5.2832,0.375,2.8221,0.4685,2.2362,2.0988,1.5435,5.9236,0.5688,5.857,0.2159,1.4676,2.8333,1.9748,2.5042,2.2513,2.2621,0.715,6.6965,5.0217,2.4288,3.9397,2.4252,0.7957,2.2682,4.6203,1.0712,0.3549,1.3578,0.7054,1.1102,5.84,2.8267,1.4585,5.7377,0.3269,0.279,1.6856,4.4715,0.3133,2.0141,2.5146,3.7582,4.8041,2.1576,0.7464,4.1615,1.7646,1.1311,1.5457,1.8508,5.3899,0.4782,3.8286,0.4483,1.4603,0.2797,1.1063]}

There is no hurry, and most people in the city just don\u2019t get that. Gulnar is a tiny village, and it\u2019s the type of place where people can put down roots. As time goes on though, the village is starting to lose its charm. There are cars on the roads, the houses have all the same decorations and they all look the same. What\u2019s more, all the children in the school have the same clothes, and they seem to forget that they are growing up. The reason is that their parents are busy with their work in the city, and they don\u2019t pay much attention to their children. But these children just don\u2019t know about their lives. Even then, the village\u2019s beauty shines through even during the most mundane of times, which will allow you to appreciate it through your eyes.

In exchange for a lighter sentence, he was given the opportunity to use his skills in the employment of the devil, scamming the damned and convincing the living to give up their souls. Hi! Billy Mays here, and have I got a deal for YOU! You can have a better job and a better life and be my faithful slave forever. Hell? My own damned self? But then, why not?\nThe story is told in the usual manner : Billy Mays becomes a devil and the Devil tells Billy he\u2019s only hired him so that he can help him. His previous Devil died suddenly and left Billy alone with all his duties to complete. It is then revealed that Billy Mays is in fact Billy Mays the baseball player, the man who had just been traded to a team from Brooklyn and had just been suspended for three games.\nThe first act takes place in Hell, and it\u2019s an awesome scene. It features three separate acts of torture, and there\u2019s a cool moment where Billy Mays is tortured by one of the Satanists ( I won\u2019t give away who or why he was tortured ) and after he is tortured he makes a wry comment about himself. It\u2019s the sort of thing that makes the plot more believable.\nAfter he\u2019s tortured he is able to return to Earth and tell the other Satanists about his time in Hell and their plan to return Billy Mays to Hell ( where Billy was released and sent to Hell again after his first return ) and they agree to give Billy a chance to redeem himself.\nThen the second act begins in the White House with the President and the other Satanists who are his aides. They have prepared a scene for Billy Mays and try to convince the President to sign an amnesty act which would give Billy Mays a return to Earth. Billy gets the President to agree to sign the bill. Unfortunately, before he gets the amnesty act signed, Satan himself calls in to tell the President that he is having doubts about Billy Mays and he wants to see him in Hell in person. The President sends Billy back to Hell ( where he is shown to be still getting his shit together by having the Devil come to Hell three times a week to see Billy Mays and check up on his progress ) and after this he is freed and sent back to Earth!\nThe third part of the book features a visit to Hell : one of the Satanists in the White House tells Billy Mays that the President is keeping Billy in the same cell he had while he was being tortured. Billy discovers that his cell is actually in Hell and he\u2019s able to talk to the Devil. He\u2019s been freed from Hell and sent back to Earth to save his old coach after his death, and the man he served as his servant for twenty years. His old coach turns out to be a shady guy and Billy can\u2019t get a chance to redeem himself because he just needs to be able to do something to help his old coach before he becomes a ghost and he can\u2019t do anything else, just to save him. This is a really sad scene.\nSo, it\u2019s an entertaining book, but when you look at who wrote it you have to say that they should have chosen someone else.","token_len":688,"entropy":[5.0932,2.2439,0.5828,8.6922,6.5013,1.1847,9.842,0.1607,1.1575,6.6703,1.6524,3.2676,6.9574,0.4398,3.2292,6.545,0.9873,0.3644,1.1825,1.2062,1.1616,1.7307,2.9186,0.0679,5.4797,0.7131,4.1989,1.5179,1.5038,10.0175,0.3558,2.0114,4.9063,2.5969,11.8927,0.3212,2.1755,9.4514,3.767,6.6185,1.125,5.8467,1.3196,2.9414,2.2306,0.7497,2.5356,0.8134,11.9501,5.1148,4.1884,0.5793,0.0067,7.7359,2.0489,3.1382,6.2826,3.3877,2.6412,1.9172,4.6375,1.6186,7.3002,2.3974,3.6376,2.1803,4.3118,2.5582,4.89,2.5945,3.6856,2.4035,0.6918,0.3771,4.1449,3.2059,4.1479,6.7333,2.7442,4.6097,1.3018,5.824,5.0597,5.5971,6.067,5.2363,4.8714,2.1446,5.2161,4.7696,1.5408,3.9269,2.2158,1.5343,2.8835,5.8891,4.2026,2.2056,2.7882,0.9188,1.3467,7.9225,2.4767,8.1506,2.1506,0.6236,0.0012,6.4171,0.8,3.7782,2.2035,3.7165,2.243,5.4723,1.987,3.6196,17.3179,8.042,0.9996,5.7653,7.3288,4.9194,4.2876,1.3442,0.2384,0.464,4.4442,3.1614,2.6363,4.9096,6.7245,6.7501,8.3986,5.4273,1.6162,5.7619,2.3547,4.6729,1.9463,5.0285,1.2628,5.4955,3.3868,4.8307,0.5686,4.0192,1.5512,3.3514,1.69,0.2347,0.8958,1.5796,0.0009,1.7568,3.6356,0.7348,4.1836,1.1593,0.1165,4.0238,12.3523,1.1387,1.9042,2.6929,3.6763,0.6927,3.9523,4.6311,1.995,5.496,1.1525,4.1598,3.1428,3.9885,6.1082,2.4754,2.8527,2.3961,1.7951,6.5707,0.9779,3.8913,0.8535,1.3557,2.1603,2.1098,4.413,4.8478,4.9884,0.0586,1.2279,2.2904,1.4882,2.7662,2.862,9.4534,0.5362,0.013,3.9503,4.8728,2.2993,0.9999,2.9149,5.1568,5.4374,6.2453,5.6299,1.5375,4.526,1.4612,2.4905,4.0403,1.0789,0.1252,0.0422,1.2354,7.1235,3.2907,1.2698,0.7794,1.3772,0.0008,1.5943,4.5049,1.3546,3.9575,0.1569,0.5392,5.8108,0.4615,3.7611,9.494,5.211,1.5265,0.4619,0.9883,5.5471,2.1463,3.9955,4.5908,4.3047,2.9118,2.6677,1.7366,3.1518,1.0168,5.1392,1.8937,1.5487,2.6813,2.0424,5.085,1.0982,5.5467,2.5103,3.1978,0.8385,4.3234,1.7905,2.5064,1.4885,0.0152,0.0096,3.461,4.0529,0.0048,1.7819,0.9454,2.782,3.4199,6.0432,4.2749,4.2707,1.0457,1.0946,4.3098,3.1331,4.1154,0.0356,0.0085,0.5627,2.3184,2.34,4.9781,0.0097,4.7167,0.2444,4.8008,1.1292,4.1177,1.3478,5.186,5.9946,0.0934,1.3602,0.926,4.9627,0.9593,0.0828,2.2348,3.3202,4.1212,0.2931,4.7564,4.4358,0.3962,0.0012,0.5541,1.7421,4.1658,5.6114,3.347,3.4926,5.8883,2.7603,3.7691,0.7761,1.3913,5.069,3.3633,1.8719,3.867,5.7879,1.5171,1.218,3.5923,5.2661,0.2958,3.5795,1.6495,1.9411,2.444,0.325,4.1651,0.1769,1.0049,1.4093,5.2222,2.363,3.7913,0.159,2.8743,2.9567,2.9011,7.1038,1.2903,4.117,1.2885,2.6912,2.1948,1.5309,3.4164,1.9152,0.0278,4.9226,1.4526,7.436,5.8366,1.508,2.423,3.4815,6.5902,0.7774,6.8178,2.1514,1.2608,0.9957,0.001,1.8572,6.4742,0.1155,1.5247,3.8874,1.2328,1.0754,4.1025,2.2271,3.3303,5.6871,3.1413,1.1505,2.8942,2.1972,0.7921,0.0012,1.4659,6.9329,0.2951,4.2096,0.8647,3.0763,5.5293,2.7232,4.1358,0.5772,2.1565,0.9555,4.3618,0.9158,2.5819,1.896,4.5477,0.6714,5.1148,1.3402,3.4891,1.8988,6.242,2.1796,0.5578,0.87,5.1109,6.5558,5.845,3.0844,2.047,2.632,1.7942,1.1155,0.8295,1.1475,1.6763,6.0025,4.7815,0.3475,1.629,0.1233,0.0022,1.6764,2.6339,2.6397,0.4567,2.547,1.1459,2.7362,3.3177,4.665,4.7732,0.421,2.1586,0.5444,4.719,1.2331,2.623,0.1614,0.9166,4.2949,2.5337,0.696,1.2582,4.4429,1.189,0.6294,4.0705,7.0101,2.3686,4.6675,0.0294,4.7752,4.5637,2.4021,2.0872,3.5713,1.1555,3.2809,8.2981,0.6862,4.2443,1.2887,2.3056,3.4309,2.0579,0.7431,0.0011,2.2741,7.0305,3.3421,0.0307,1.9987,1.5359,1.547,0.5637,3.3972,4.1599,2.7844,1.6618,5.7542,1.8783,2.8321,0.9807,0.1162,1.1314,6.6464,0.5907,1.8707,2.9664,4.693,0.4698,0.2235,4.575,4.1529,1.4752,6.4867,1.025,1.5413,7.8142,5.2111,0.619,0.4305,2.4606,0.2838,4.1092,1.3133,0.4493,0.0035,2.9819,0.2627,0.53,0.0011,0.7703,2.4631,2.6356,1.6278,6.2589,3.3738,2.1246,2.6211,5.3658,4.627,2.5403,2.3042,5.8135,0.9764,0.1927,3.0763,0.2483,1.2194,1.8899,8.0925,0.3133,3.2727,1.9985,0.9985,2.8732,2.7699,1.1123,1.3766,2.0959,2.1907,0.1259,0.0057,4.0682,0.0074,3.7048,0.3493,1.1742,1.1577,2.8209,2.2289,1.8455,0.0133,0.0094,6.3025,5.0729,1.79,1.1032,0.9961,3.0774,0.4798,0.1081,0.6324,2.5647,4.3631,1.0243,4.5303,9.2899,7.0303,2.1371,3.9154,3.1577,1.633,2.5765,5.2453,2.842,6.8084,2.4023,2.3174,5.5726,3.14,4.495,0.4065,1.9972,5.3149,2.9241,0.3561,6.2494,0.1079,0.0424,0.1147,1.5039,7.4633,2.6955,2.3567,1.9648,5.2726,2.4886,0.0524,0.024,2.7143,2.7384,4.5217,0.0469,5.3315,0.0239,3.0842,0.9212,4.9914,4.6353,0.5708,2.9829,2.8361,0.0027,3.8445,1.851,2.6494,2.2055,1.699,0.7275,0.1972,6.4628,0.6867,3.9016,1.0217,4.9501,2.9051,3.1873,3.049,1.6249,0.0106,0.0128,1.888,1.0123,1.9771,3.8562,4.1083,2.5785,1.3598,3.0805,0.7153,3.8609,1.0318,2.3311,3.4695,4.2585,1.6053,1.971,0.4475,4.5252,1.3733,3.4481,1.6434,0.0325,0.0048,3.6037,5.4516,2.8438,1.7695,1.4973,4.7649,1.1008,2.9464,0.1587,7.6301,6.1364,0.5,2.6172,3.1604,0.1031,2.9743,0.8202,4.5231,5.3021,0.7687,5.0002,4.3353,1.8593,1.5199]}
{"prompt":"The `` Shh '' sound that parents make to children at night is actually an ancient spell that keeps a terrible nocturnal evil at bay","text":"The `` Shh '' sound that parents make to children at night is actually an ancient spell that keeps a terrible nocturnal evil at bay. So many times, you can find that a child has woken up during the night with a cold or other illness, even after their parent was asleep for hours, and can not know why. This simple spell was used as a way to guard against nightmares and keep away any witchcraft or sorcery. The spell itself is a very easy one, and will have the desired effect with full conviction. This spell will allow the child the ability to control their fear and can go back into their sleep at night, and they will wake up without a problem at all. The best part of these spells is that the child does not even need to know the name of their little devil. All you have to do is go through the instructions carefully and the spell will take hold, at which point the child will have been protected from bad things and is able to drift back to sleep easily and soundly.\nOne thing to remember is that this spell will do nothing to cure a cold or fever, which is not the purpose of the spell. This spell is meant to keep a good night sleep, and a calm sleep at night.\nHere you will find all the best resources from the internet to research or create a family tree.

They are the oldest preserved remains in London of the Roman city of Iulia Trajaniana Traj\u00e1nna, founded as a Roman municipium by the Consul Lucius Antonius Stephanianus in AD 97 when the Roman Empire was expanding into Britannia. Roman forts and other military buildings (most of which have been destroyed) are also in the area. One notable feature of Lewisham and the Steps was the presence of the River Ouse between Lewisham and Hounslow High Street, to which Roman military fortifications and a military aqueduct were connected. The Steps are approximately 1 mile (2.5 km) in length and were excavated by Richard Stanton at the beginning of the 20th century. Several Roman forts from the era of Roman Britain were also discovered at nearby Thurloe.\nOne of the oldest known Roman military installations in Britain is on the steps that lie across the river from Lewisham and Hounslow High Street, south of the railway bridge. The Steps were first excavated by Richard Stanton between 1909 and 1914 when he started work at Newbury Quay Museum and the Roman Military Site on Thurloe and also to study the Roman military equipment excavated at nearby Thurloe. The site, known as Steps 1 and 2, is approximately 1 mile (2.5 km) in length. Steps 3 and 4 lie north of Steps 1 and 2, separated from Steps 1 and 2 by the railway bridge. The Steps include a number of large buildings, including a temple, which was used for military purposes, and a public square area. The Steps belong to the Roman military system in Britain.","token_len":688,"entropy":[10.8809,14.8721,7.4774,7.9889,6.5393,4.9576,9.5644,3.0862,2.7561,3.8228,4.2712,3.0754,1.4461,4.4664,3.1504,4.8796,6.2737,1.8076,6.0492,3.6575,11.0805,10.4387,0.8783,0.0047,5.5135,2.4477,0.0028,0.5252,4.5484,3.6532,3.6006,1.6113,4.6353,2.5428,3.9465,3.5387,3.3997,1.3658,3.0371,6.8014,0.0233,0.1252,5.1387,0.3539,1.4512,3.1029,1.13,5.1468,2.1893,4.983,3.4363,1.6134,3.7674,3.7165,3.5257,3.6486,4.4399,1.0955,2.9422,2.6967,2.298,1.4583,4.7231,4.9951,5.0515,2.3191,0.9455,3.2397,6.5016,2.1548,3.7457,1.6986,3.7139,0.3715,2.7344,0.4979,6.0996,0.3026,5.0149,1.583,4.7324,5.0515,3.3023,9.7369,1.8512,3.2774,1.1224,2.0687,3.6928,4.5763,1.0891,2.289,3.0778,4.7092,2.1226,2.4879,1.0492,4.9912,4.4159,2.8464,3.7638,0.0683,4.7672,8.5536,7.8906,0.7354,3.7991,1.1755,3.6145,4.8058,1.5305,0.3733,5.0269,1.3286,0.0159,4.3073,1.6861,4.5387,1.2973,5.5733,6.1586,3.6914,2.6568,1.9512,2.2286,2.6164,3.1088,1.8127,2.4946,3.848,0.8067,3.5023,0.1977,4.1212,2.5241,2.9873,3.7722,1.7716,0.2853,2.0909,4.3106,1.9818,1.5402,5.0956,0.4936,0.3952,0.3,2.5253,0.5331,3.2835,0.0409,3.398,1.3097,0.2109,2.2299,2.1209,1.2323,0.1113,1.7422,6.697,4.8597,1.4644,4.2256,2.6305,1.0987,0.0075,0.0531,0.0695,4.5382,3.0471,0.5923,5.127,3.2776,0.9759,3.4419,2.0978,0.4726,4.3005,4.0394,3.113,5.6625,2.024,0.1488,1.1117,0.2754,0.5962,3.0616,4.0931,5.5257,1.0785,6.0614,4.5007,2.0017,4.5989,1.9316,0.0122,7.8453,1.5795,1.3925,0.2239,5.3532,2.6722,7.6976,0.2811,0.3269,2.7348,6.217,3.2886,1.1413,1.2443,0.8661,0.1388,2.0275,0.5918,2.6887,4.7526,2.0437,0.8834,3.8428,2.5872,4.1584,1.0137,5.3219,1.1074,3.9178,0.9416,3.2719,2.4589,4.8282,0.2094,1.6445,0.5604,0.6353,3.4298,1.1399,1.1846,3.1964,0.2403,2.4487,2.4939,4.1507,2.1403,3.6136,1.0736,0.9552,3.9235,5.9908,2.1682,3.4536,0.3374,0.6643,2.9476,4.6228,4.5054,1.3291,0.4176,3.6166,0.8688,3.8896,5.6249,5.1164,1.4751,4.8966,1.9977,9.0624,5.7296,4.5503,1.6384,6.7076,4.7806,2.4412,6.8621,3.3442,6.038,2.9979,5.2945,0.0594,0.0371,13.9774,1.2468,2.4462,1.1319,2.0796,0.1341,1.0514,5.9141,1.6434,7.0558,2.0579,9.5574,2.6774,4.2334,5.5961,4.471,3.3469,7.7285,2.8665,5.5475,4.6241,2.4189,2.2342,2.6842,7.7371,4.5153,5.7481,9.815,2.9172,1.9159,1.8183,6.2502,0.0286,7.7149,2.7375,0.0074,0.9728,5.6554,11.3721,0.1661,4.6549,2.1147,0.0019,1.2239,1.3905,1.859,5.1238,0.1233,6.4955,0.0094,3.3531,1.0281,3.1015,3.6814,3.7944,1.8994,1.6995,0.8497,2.664,1.0049,1.7268,0.0012,0.002,1.7503,6.0375,2.9898,0.0285,0.0033,0.9361,3.2983,0.0505,0.0012,8.5942,1.0514,0.8607,3.5907,0.7732,2.6266,1.4853,6.5261,5.0868,2.066,3.4884,3.783,2.3763,5.0089,3.4301,0.4667,5.7077,8.3569,7.6557,0.4464,10.8634,8.6996,5.3081,10.3098,5.1577,1.1974,4.5233,4.8057,0.917,2.3773,9.8061,0.0646,2.4362,0.9766,8.5343,0.8153,3.8095,5.2029,0.4382,9.6587,5.6964,0.6253,2.6397,4.4112,5.5915,6.4733,1.6352,2.1927,1.3849,0.6961,4.0886,2.2077,8.9986,0.0242,0.3993,5.8259,8.7216,1.2841,1.7754,3.2096,3.5109,2.4347,5.7109,5.0355,1.0656,0.4795,2.482,0.6876,1.5077,1.3352,1.979,2.9544,2.0212,0.5251,0.7095,0.844,5.0467,5.1927,3.3075,0.2466,4.801,0.0003,0.0011,4.1054,2.5299,11.6605,5.2444,0.7237,3.2855,0.0172,2.1116,6.8343,4.5184,4.1963,7.6345,3.1003,0.0006,0.0008,0.2711,1.053,0.003,0.0007,1.2759,0.0672,1.3351,5.4468,1.9115,3.99,4.6608,2.8181,0.1883,2.5867,3.9576,3.8752,7.1374,0.0338,0.0002,1.7571,2.1704,0.5202,1.5874,6.2371,1.9562,6.2597,2.8433,2.4248,3.0318,1.3352,1.3217,1.0862,0.5906,0.0241,3.1193,0.2892,0.9147,4.0193,4.9486,0.001,1.8845,7.4122,8.9473,3.4937,1.0728,3.4992,0.0084,0.2956,1.5265,0.0138,0.2429,0.4431,6.0888,3.1917,6.1303,0.0016,5.4861,0.8854,6.3255,1.7227,3.232,5.5621,1.4183,1.9053,3.1442,2.6901,6.9425,7.9647,5.0939,6.1474,3.1215,1.6325,3.8728,0.547,0.0836,2.5789,3.5021,0.6815,2.6528,3.8122,1.1807,1.7741,1.6033,3.809,0.7467,5.7533,5.703,3.8703,3.5946,0.6869,1.5011,0.6923,1.4153,0.0002,0.0014,2.7653,0.9942,0.001,0.0006,0.4927,0.0596,1.6489,5.6238,0.4556,1.166,5.4006,3.7278,1.5505,1.28,6.7269,1.2714,3.7971,2.5902,0.0004,1.6372,2.7626,0.6629,4.6052,6.4468,0.0738,3.1825,4.0141,0.8144,4.5163,3.2707,2.3323,7.6231,2.5054,8.4192,0.2427,6.8966,2.968,2.7524,5.4656,2.3955,6.4729,3.328,4.6696,0.006,0.002,4.4011,5.1608,3.4209,7.2261,0.7971,1.9755,2.4392,4.6535,5.5241,0.0441,1.5184,4.8504,3.0981,0.0392,0.0052,0.8873,1.514,3.6274,3.7393,3.4009,0.4839,10.7586,3.9707,1.0284,0.1782,0.509,1.3382,4.8583,1.9081,1.0095,0.0953,1.1561,0.2153,0.5407,0.0089,0.0234,1.1585,0.3268,2.2653,6.0479,2.6757,0.3765,0.048,4.2119,4.7041,0.427,7.6312,0.6783,0.1843,0.1098,1.3618,5.4302,2.7906,5.7318,0.7405,0.5627,0.0665,0.0721,1.9989,3.272,0.2681,0.8705,1.141,4.1977,6.599,1.5076,3.4556,0.0055,4.2368,3.1968,1.1946,1.1692,1.2286,4.9769,1.033,5.1315,1.3393,3.1369,1.7394,2.2296,0.941,2.2155,0.8958,1.0212,6.3434,2.8895,7.7798,1.392,1.1777,3.0994,8.3711,0.0154,0.4984,1.4465,2.7993,4.5231,3.8551,1.5388,1.2672]}

'' the customer screams at you. `` I can't, '' you say. `` Satan still has a restraining order against me. '' She throws the item at you and storms off in a huff. You weren't lying, or being a smart ass. Satan really does have a restraining order out on you. But it has nothing to do with God. God gave it to Satan, not you. God wants you to know Satan will not have you. If you stand up to Satan, you will be attacked, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. We are under Satan s attack. God says you are under my protection. God does not allow Satan to take complete control of your life. His goal is that you have a deep relationship with Me. Satan wants you to be separated from your Father. He will attack you. You can get hurt, or you can choose to stand up to Satan and walk in your Father's security. Jesus warned his disciples, saying : \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI am the good shepherd. I know the sheep and I know their voice. My sheep recognize my voice and follow me. I give Myself as my life in order for them to find eternal life. I take the life of the shepherd for their good. He who gives His life for his sheep, and keeps them safe, has eternal life with Me. And He who kills them, and takes their life, will have no part with Me. ( John 10 : 1-8 ). God s only authority is His power, His strength and His control. Satan would love for you to quit being a part of God s creation. If you do, he will attack you. He will try everything he can do to get you into fear. Once you are afraid of him, he will keep you afraid. When we walk with God, we are free from all fear. But if we walk with Satan, we will be afraid. This is a problem, not because of Satan, but of choice. Satan loves it when we are afraid. There is a price to everything. Satan lures you with fear, but he will only keep you in his service for one reason. If you do not follow him, you are no longer under Satan, or any of his demons. You will be under Me. You will be in victory over Satan. Jesus said : \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI have come that they may have life, and have it to the full\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd ( John 10 : 10 ). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI was a slave to sin, but God set me free.

{"prompt":"A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up .","text":"A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.I feel terrible for him.He really doesn\u2019t like hitchhikers.The whole movie seems a little out of place in my opinion.The two stories seem to be unrelated.Both very sad and dark.\nHector the Hangover is a hitler movie. Not only is it about Hitler, but it\u2019s about another Hitler, Hitler\u2019s son. Hitler\u2019s son would like to do what his father did to Germany, so he starts killing people by \u201cplaying\u201d his piano. I watched it last Thursday and didn\u2019t enjoy it very much.\nThe only things I liked were the background music, the way the killer played the piano, and the final scene in which the murderers take the police into their own trap.\nThis film is very interesting. It\u2019s about a group of people who work in the same store, but they\u2019re all different so it\u2019s hard on each person trying to fit in. One of them is afraid of heights, another likes to play with fire, and yet another has a crush on a guy. Their boss is trying to keep them together so bad it\u2019s driving people crazy and then one person finally breaks free.\nOverall I found it pretty interesting too, although it wasn\u2019t as good as I\u2019d like it to be. I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars because I thought it was a good movie and it will inspire you to try something.\nThe movie shows a couple\u2019s relationship. The movie is about how the relationship changes with time and what they try to do to fix it as time goes on. I really liked the movie. It was a movie I could relate too. The movie made me think about my own relationship with my boyfriend and what I think he has to do to make me love him more. The movie was quite nice.\nThe movie was about a guy named Tim, and a girl named Lily. These girls know each other from middle school and had only kept in touch. After Lily and her boyfriend break up she comes to Tim\u2019s house to see how he is. She tells her friend about how Tim\u2019s her real ex-boyfriend and that they dated in middle school. They keep in touch again later that summer, and that\u2019s where the movie starts with Tim having a weird dream.\nLater Lily notices Tim and asks if he wants to go out with her. They go on a date and talk about how they first kissed. Soon after that a police officer comes by and Tim runs away because he\u2019s afraid of how it feels and what it means. They talk about that and how they think that it\u2019s nice that he finally felt something in his life again.\nEventually they see each other again, and it seems like it\u2019ll be fine again. The next thing we know they kiss again, and it goes on and on forever. Then one night Lily and her boyfriend are together at a restaurant where Tim is sitting alone. His brain is going to overdrive and he\u2019s talking himself out of kicking Lily\u2019s boyfriend away because he likes him despite the fact that his ex-fianc?e is there with him.","token_len":692,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,2.1149,4.6817,9.3432,0.0589,0.0808,11.0874,0.3019,1.2017,4.7862,0.2259,1.4878,2.8898,3.7919,4.0754,1.3134,4.7487,0.7329,0.0413,0.804,9.6882,4.6696,6.0225,0.8042,3.5121,1.0052,4.0433,5.4884,3.0382,15.6148,6.9298,2.774,3.5718,4.6572,0.0137,1.0621,0.6232,4.4746,4.2581,4.3243,5.03,3.9126,1.3637,4.4787,0.0368,0.7009,2.7504,2.1666,0.9811,0.5191,3.1722,6.3893,5.1794,4.3896,1.2229,1.0173,5.377,0.811,5.4861,8.2363,4.5939,1.4452,6.1199,0.6217,5.5193,10.4324,7.8308,4.8792,10.2113,1.3767,1.9261,1.2929,6.6833,12.393,2.9123,1.0016,5.1505,1.5046,1.1221,0.4745,3.4354,8.5317,1.1093,0.6403,0.6992,12.0065,0.6067,0.4086,0.7942,6.4912,5.121,2.3669,5.5613,3.4832,0.1644,0.535,3.1357,1.0292,6.0592,2.3804,0.0253,0.0908,0.3419,5.5968,3.9281,0.2635,4.2367,3.3641,3.4644,0.3188,0.9077,2.4364,6.4874,1.755,3.2802,0.8099,4.8194,1.8009,1.5266,5.3495,13.3838,4.3996,7.1803,4.4798,6.417,4.2422,6.8483,0.8374,3.4511,5.9068,1.2862,3.9394,5.6746,1.2486,4.6078,0.9661,0.8522,0.0088,4.0788,0.1956,3.9267,0.0173,0.3364,2.4471,3.2842,3.102,4.7881,0.7625,1.825,2.3814,0.5886,5.6014,0.4414,1.7509,1.1252,4.4033,1.085,6.7716,2.9135,1.2176,0.7215,0.8798,0.715,0.3875,7.0164,1.1783,2.6219,0.8467,1.2927,6.233,4.1692,1.9291,7.2592,3.8348,1.2288,1.6053,6.1287,0.4525,1.9159,3.6857,3.7379,1.0318,2.8094,4.2616,1.0704,1.6273,1.4416,0.1108,0.0063,2.4508,1.2528,3.6485,0.0491,2.1263,0.4778,4.5059,1.7511,1.5623,3.0407,5.4153,2.0697,2.265,2.0419,3.3538,0.0839,1.4358,2.9976,3.0923,6.0953,1.7356,1.0048,0.0181,0.0383,2.5071,7.4249,3.3349,4.5219,6.4894,0.0208,4.8453,0.9299,0.665,5.2875,0.8231,1.0037,1.1266,6.634,0.7496,5.897,1.189,3.7197,5.6128,0.7586,2.9416,2.7581,3.9619,1.5868,0.6072,3.4273,0.5627,3.4072,1.3132,3.6341,0.0104,1.3427,3.0415,2.4674,6.3334,7.218,1.2371,4.5716,0.0464,3.9902,1.0587,2.2319,2.5513,7.0415,3.9342,1.2146,0.0275,0.0149,6.9345,5.1767,1.0438,3.2786,4.8265,4.3015,4.5887,6.1964,3.3867,4.0401,1.3849,1.4721,6.0207,2.1188,3.574,1.8412,3.9909,2.0655,6.0141,2.2021,3.8118,1.8229,3.3227,0.3802,0.0585,0.0665,2.1157,1.97,0.1434,1.8696,4.2557,0.0058,1.4844,1.3911,0.809,1.2352,0.1413,0.3115,1.9946,7.4473,0.6939,1.3544,2.525,0.9891,0.8516,0.7485,0.0005,0.1388,5.2667,2.765,1.7536,2.8663,0.5411,0.759,1.5179,2.3045,0.435,2.2515,2.358,5.863,6.7482,2.6471,0.3783,3.0849,2.8307,2.9692,1.1248,2.9578,3.1169,7.0162,2.1422,4.8937,10.8997,0.1524,0.1239,4.5999,3.24,1.6855,3.3559,1.7205,1.5058,3.8112,2.104,5.5662,4.0518,3.054,1.4886,1.7465,3.5028,4.0833,5.4127,0.1529,0.5828,1.0814,4.5901,0.5154,6.059,2.6979,0.1681,0.4366,0.188,2.6331,3.1792,0.9425,0.8777,2.7092,1.6179,2.0501,1.9197,1.8611,5.226,2.9788,3.654,3.6102,6.6621,0.7417,2.839,2.3307,4.3825,0.1155,1.8156,0.9146,2.3183,1.5809,2.6712,0.4798,1.0945,3.5805,1.4939,2.9779,1.7863,3.5883,2.5283,3.8621,1.4908,0.3959,0.4667,2.3478,1.7136,3.4153,0.1279,2.0261,0.2712,2.7144,0.6336,2.0161,4.7647,4.3849,1.5162,1.2546,1.967,1.7313,1.809,3.7514,1.8044,2.6551,3.0639,7.5617,2.4929,2.7227,3.9919,2.0303,0.266,6.28,0.6205,4.9907,4.2815,6.3235,0.557,0.03,2.4816,5.9826,0.0307,1.2914,5.4118,4.8299,8.4624,1.5556,0.2327,4.3994,4.4715,4.5151,3.1263,3.7182,0.9229,3.6324,0.0314,4.8568,4.6565,1.2127,3.4465,4.8379,0.0138,0.0452,0.9208,1.3288,3.3893,3.1156,1.3571,1.3609,2.9293,2.0403,2.5734,4.4343,4.3547,1.7888,2.0008,1.5058,3.2142,0.0101,0.0155,7.1451,5.139,5.6691,1.5473,0.3645,0.0041,1.7799,2.5429,2.5016,7.4923,3.0458,2.2578,0.0072,0.5752,2.5075,5.5589,0.8545,0.0522,5.7178,4.2157,1.9874,3.516,2.1121,0.9956,3.9198,2.4243,0.0048,0.0473,2.4721,1.9781,1.9274,2.0466,5.6621,1.8388,4.9207,1.3038,6.376,1.6627,1.2433,1.1972,6.2741,6.9458,5.622,1.4626,1.9698,3.8546,1.9021,0.8475,2.7138,0.1864,2.0466,2.0613,0.5892,0.4554,0.7552,3.8742,1.7661,3.95,0.4384,0.1679,1.1506,5.548,0.5548,1.8593,1.2559,7.7115,5.4532,1.4305,5.2417,1.5311,2.364,5.4063,6.4731,0.5755,1.2738,3.1467,0.7874,6.2752,5.9751,1.9703,4.6353,0.4901,2.5016,0.0208,0.0213,1.7202,0.7916,5.0911,3.6414,4.2904,4.2058,3.0232,1.9039,1.8967,1.6478,3.7951,2.6294,0.4073,4.1086,1.7673,2.9335,1.0742,4.166,3.4396,2.4029,0.9948,0.0057,0.0281,4.6923,2.6198,1.5766,6.191,6.195,4.4987,3.1451,1.3522,1.7148,3.9345,0.4528,0.9435,4.1677,2.3896,4.5528,1.737,0.0213,0.9421,2.1486,0.4145,3.2277,2.6495,1.7992,2.5449,1.9562,0.0045,7.2276,0.6214,4.9655,5.1469,0.3276,2.7802,3.9645,3.4683,3.5107,0.2216,1.8704,6.0979,1.4778,1.4978,0.3787,2.0009,4.5252,2.2756,2.5661,0.0365,5.709,0.2042,4.4882,3.9835,2.2389,2.5532,1.796,3.309,0.1613,2.8798,4.6376,3.4171,2.2951,2.8337,3.7969,0.8013,1.2718,3.5943,3.3617,1.2773,4.8011,7.1867,1.3684,4.3293,2.7589,8.0442,4.4512,0.9364,0.8919,1.7096,0.0185,0.0284,5.1035,6.8761,2.3608,0.0189,8.5955,3.2904,5.5637,0.005,0.0797,1.308,7.9274,2.852,0.624,4.0569,3.471,9.7091,2.0996,0.2732,0.1985,3.3531,4.5026,1.0214,8.2415,0.5082,2.1763,13.331,4.7535,1.7311,3.8047,3.4385,0.1741,0.3583]}

It has something to do with God the creator, God the architect, God the engineer. And all I can do is give them names.\nThe first time I got into a plane I thought it was the last time I ever got into a plane. The first time I got a job after college I thought it was the last time I ever got a job... Then I got a job for 40 years. The first time I had a child and made an appointment in the medical center I thought it was the last time I ever had a child. The first time I traveled on my own I thought it was the last time I ever traveled on my own. Then I did it and it was wonderful.\nWhat can we do to help? Help us think outside of the box. Help us realize we do have the power and imagination to accomplish, that we deserve to do as little or as much what we want to do in our life. Help us realize we are all alone in the universe, but there is a power that allows us, and our love that allows us to create.\nThe world is full of people who are just like you, just like me, just like my family, my friends and my neighbors. We can all share with one another what life is about, what is possible. We can all have a voice and a chance. We can take each other to our heart and share our love. We can be part of a movement to make change. We all have the ability to make a difference and be a part of this miracle that is living in our world. Let us use our time and all our energy to love and grow. Use this moment. Let us share our stories, our wisdom and our courage, and let us show what really is possible.\nA new study from scientists at Carnegie Mellon University may offer insight into why we are drawn to the beauty of our natural environment. They found that a person\u2019s tendency to appreciate the natural world may be based, in part, on the structure of their dopamine pathways. A dopamine-rich pathway can be described\u2026\n\u2026And I have found that the mind is more important than all of that, the brain is a tool for the mind to get out what it wants \u2013 that\u2019s what I want. You know, I\u2019m happy, I love it, I feel good, I\u2019m healthy, like, I\u2019m at peace, you\u2019re going, that\u2019s my life; that\u2019s what I want and if you\u2026\n\u2026You go, \u2018Well, I was a writer and a journalist, right? And that\u2019s what I do and that\u2019s what I loved.\u2019 But the truth is that you don\u2019t always know what your favorite thing is until you do it for the first time. It\u2019s like my favorite flower. I didn\u2019t know it was a flower. Like my\u2026\n\u2026The brain has a lot of secrets. I call it the little mysteries of the brain that most people haven\u2019t yet uncovered, that still intrigue people. The mind is like a blank notebook full of things that no one has ever seen.

{"prompt":"SatChat : What is the biggest obstacle you 've overcome in your writing ?","text":"SatChat : What is the biggest obstacle you've overcome in your writing? Is it money, deadlines, or time constraints? If deadlines or time constraints, tell us why you chose these. What did you do to overcome? If you've written multiple books, what was the biggest obstacle to each and why?\nSt. Matthew\u2019s Lutheran Church is blessed to have such an active and successful youth ministry. We have a few groups to make it all work together \u2013 the youth and elementary, high school and college ministries.\nOne of the goals of the high school and college ministries of St. Matthew\u2019s Lutheran Church is to encourage students to think seriously about getting involved in their school ministries, church, and community.\nI encourage all students who attend church here to get involved in both the youth ministry and college ministry to gain an early understanding of how the church, as well as many others, work. Some students do not even know that we have a youth and adult band!\nYour high school student, with his\/her best friends, probably has a youth and high school group of their own. If they are not involved in church and don\u2019t know anything about the music ministry, they will not be invited to the church\u2019s youth camp or to the Sunday youth service with their younger siblings.\nAs we do with the youth group, a group of your college students probably has their own club. Our high school band does a very good job inviting students into the music ministry \u2013 even seniors. Most students do not know that they belong to a college band, so they don\u2019t join it, and it is a great loss for our church.\nIf there is any college band in your town, the youth and high school ministries often work together. The youth group sometimes has the privilege of inviting college students to church as volunteers and they benefit by learning more about the church than they would in a single church class. In both cases, the youth groups, the high school ministries and the church all get to give back to their communities.\nIf you are a parent of a student who attends a college band, don\u2019t hesitate to give him\/her an invitation to church! The church will be happy to give you any recommendations for a good college band.\nAre we so intent on teaching college students all that the church stands for that we forget to teach youth? Some of our high school and youth leaders are very happy to give their time to help teach the youth group.\nWe want our youth groups to be safe, fun and educational, but sometimes we need to be reminded that the most important thing is to keep the Gospel in the forefront.\nThe college and youth ministries work very well together and we really enjoy working with you on this important topic!\nIf you are a parent and can join in the activities of the youth group or band, please don\u2019t hesitate to do so. The benefit is only for everyone, so why not try.\nIf your high school student and his\/her new friends join the high school band, the band can ask him to join the youth choir. Everyone learns to play music by doing, so don\u2019t be shy!\nYou can find a list of all the high school and college bands in your community!

forget this kind of day. i don\u2019t know what to call it. i think i call it a birthday. but i don\u2019t know if it is a birthday. a day\nhow can i tell you guys that is really annoying. in fact. i don\u2019t really understand what is so annoying. i didn\u2019t tell you that before. and you probably still don\u2019t understand when i say this stuff. i can\u2019t explain because you don\u2019t

i\u2019m poor in some ways and not poor in others. you don\u2019t understand me. and i can\u2019t make myself so clear. because you don\u2019t understand the same way i\u2019m\nis there a meaning to life? is there meaning. and i\u2019m wondering what it is. is there meaning. and i\u2019m wondering and wondering if it\u2019s good or bad. if it\u2019s bad. and there\u2019s something that keeps

{"prompt":"- I signed up to the free online writing course that was posted here , and would love some feedback on this prompt .","text":"- I signed up to the free online writing course that was posted here, and would love some feedback on this prompt. I\u2019m stuck on the first sentence, because in the original version, it\u2019s just a simple phrase, but i don\u2019t feel its a good opening to start a long paragraph. I think it\u2019s better to have something that sets the stage\/ context first, then move on to the main idea.\nIt\u2019s a tricky question but I think an anecdote or a quote are appropriate in a few places. \u201cWhen I started teaching I was just 21. Before me, the faculty only spoke the language they knew and no one bothered to teach them English. I read in a book published during my first year, A Practical Manual for Teachers, that teachers of English should use an anecdote at the beginning of class and a famous quote at the end of class so that the students could easily follow their progression.\u201d\n\u201cThey started crying. It took me by surprise as I had never seen a student sob until that moment. They stood up and began walking around the classroom. Most of them had no pen or paper to write on, so they wrote out my name on an exam slip that one of them had slipped under the door.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the first student came out, I saw he was a good-looking boy with a very pleasant smile. He came up to me and asked, \u2018Is it going to be like this for the whole semester?\u201d\n\u201cI looked at the young man and he didn\u2019t change his face. I asked him, \u2018What is a person without a personality for? It\u2019s difficult to get along with people. So you see, I don\u2019t think you are happy here. You don\u2019t care for people or things. Why don\u2019t you consider moving elsewhere? \u2018 \u201d\n\u201cI saw the boy was really shaken up. I turned the student over to him, \u2018I would like to speak to you alone if you don\u2019t mind.\u2019, and sent the other students outside. The boy replied, \u2018No, I\u2019m fine. We met to discuss a problem.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I found the teacher at noon, when the school was only closed half an hour before. I was surprised to see him when they hadn\u2019t talked to anyone. He\u2019s an old friend of mine and had just come from Japan as I need a guide to take me to a place where I am supposed to take my first lessons. He\u2019s a Japanese teacher who came here two days ago and didn\u2019t know I was already here. He asked me if I wanted to learn English and when he found this course he signed me up.

{"prompt":"Write a scifi story as if you were an author from stone age","text":"Write a scifi story as if you were an author from stone age. This sounds stupid but my writer friends have advised me to make my scifi stories sound like they were written by Tolkien or Wells or something. I understand that it's better to say that you write like Robert Heinlein and write your scifi stories as if you're writing about the middle ages.\nIt may sound stupid but when you write about something else, it sounds like something is wrong with the story and you had to write like Harry Potter or George RR Martin to make it sound better.\nThis means that you'll have to change the way you describe things, to say it in that tone that you would have used in your other books, so it sounds like \"ok, I have a sword and I have to kill a spider\", instead of \"I have a sword and I have a spider in an upside down cupboard\".\nBecause if you say something else, it sounds weird and the reader won't be buying your story. You shouldn't tell them that you're writing a scifi story like you would make your scifi story sound like. Instead, make it seem like your writing style is an alien language to your readers. Your readers won't buy your books if you've made it sound like you're trying to pretend your writing is like something you wrote about thousands of years ago.\nWell that's where it gets a little more complicated. When it comes to writing scifi, I think you should focus on the genre, not the language that you want your story to sound like. There's so much more to writing about the future than trying to sound like another writer. If you read the stories by Bradbury and Heinlein, you'll find that there's an aspect of their writing that's like science fiction, despite other aspects. They write about different things, but it's still scifi because of a certain quality in the stories. So your best option is to write different things like scifi, but with the right quality.\nThere's a very important characteristic of sci-fi stories that they all share; the main character is usually an observer, and the main characters don't decide what to do to solve any problems, they're usually called on to do what the author is asking them to do but the main character isn't always completely under the control of the author, so this makes your writer's control even more important because he's doing what the author asks him to do and you have to make sure that the main character is doing what they're supposed to do to solve the problem at hand.\nSo if the answer is yes, your best option is to write a scifi story that has a main character who's an observer. They don't solve any conflicts, they're just there to watch what happens.\nIt wasn't so bad until I realised that I had to put all of my stories on my website as a page and not as an entry.\nI would say that to improve your writing, you'll have to start submitting works to publications. You don't want to leave it to chance, because it'll be easier to submit something that already has been edited than to submit something that has never been edited. So I'd recommend trying to submit a story to magazines that offer professional submission. If it's a short story and you've been able to submit it to a magazine, then you'll be able to improve your writing.","token_len":696,"entropy":[4.0641,8.9634,4.9234,2.1246,5.0898,3.159,1.7168,0.6131,3.4207,3.1562,5.403,10.0258,0.8314,1.482,3.7098,6.1703,5.2426,2.318,5.8874,7.2993,2.4854,2.5262,7.613,0.1837,0.643,3.9229,3.0894,5.1462,0.0082,0.9998,5.1439,0.9859,2.377,1.4211,0.8843,1.01,7.0765,2.4908,8.4354,2.1554,3.1858,0.717,1.8759,5.7347,1.2131,3.0236,0.9745,4.6999,0.3199,3.8456,1.4659,2.0589,3.7381,5.407,7.1838,2.7039,0.0003,2.7981,3.7006,3.6984,2.4572,0.0052,0.3316,1.3321,0.1373,0.4717,1.6504,3.0154,2.8762,2.1381,6.7052,0.2664,1.0147,2.3514,6.963,4.1874,1.0115,3.4583,0.724,3.6476,0.8971,2.0783,2.7864,3.571,5.4653,0.9726,1.5416,2.6216,1.235,3.066,4.826,2.6237,0.8218,2.6495,1.7209,2.9065,1.5242,7.0186,1.1048,2.9925,4.7986,7.2003,0.3429,0.9082,6.3761,3.1794,0.002,3.0667,1.7612,0.3815,0.2085,4.5258,0.2364,1.5846,3.4827,4.8333,0.5291,1.6611,4.5588,1.309,0.1445,3.1792,1.1952,1.8965,0.2356,5.001,2.4775,2.6357,4.5362,3.5656,3.3533,2.8627,5.7231,4.6786,2.3334,1.4197,3.5687,2.5383,2.9668,1.7266,1.7902,4.3128,3.1727,1.8574,3.3162,2.599,2.8431,0.8452,5.1898,6.2408,2.4082,2.047,4.027,1.8071,7.5329,1.6771,1.8849,2.4047,2.7888,2.6233,2.251,5.2666,4.7082,3.4469,0.0769,0.3561,1.8524,0.9938,1.3404,1.4037,0.2423,0.2514,0.4429,5.3955,1.4908,4.4436,5.4976,7.1901,0.3907,4.8923,0.2516,0.792,0.8522,5.5126,3.1482,0.3361,3.1729,1.5474,6.0159,1.5657,0.7254,1.4159,4.7867,1.4988,4.6803,2.1055,2.5873,0.0011,2.7107,6.4049,2.614,0.6049,0.8415,3.4386,5.8146,0.0004,4.4533,2.4805,1.2399,0.9691,1.6002,1.257,1.5096,3.1688,0.0048,0.1538,4.236,2.2466,2.8307,5.4782,1.5126,4.2762,0.0054,2.163,0.4014,0.3423,3.3149,3.7907,0.3623,4.0256,0.7567,4.5879,0.2091,3.0106,3.2595,4.4049,0.4829,5.2173,6.183,2.4707,2.5889,2.7166,0.7137,0.8082,5.0079,1.3515,2.3173,0.0002,3.5198,1.1356,5.7285,2.7423,0.7047,4.849,2.9353,1.8867,0.1156,0.287,1.5142,1.1914,3.1809,0.0401,6.1947,3.6717,1.9765,1.2365,3.3234,4.4588,1.8289,3.6645,2.7771,8.3019,0.0573,0.0131,0.0527,0.3125,0.54,5.8734,3.7453,0.3864,4.4937,2.6867,0.3264,2.3764,0.357,2.6716,0.9091,0.3332,3.5499,3.5899,0.0677,0.0203,1.998,2.7791,0.0146,1.0953,2.4162,2.1519,1.9076,1.222,4.6075,0.1945,1.6786,4.8926,2.6597,1.1509,1.0942,3.8863,4.3488,0.7637,3.9739,1.255,1.4715,0.0316,0.5408,0.1215,0.1625,4.3618,1.4489,3.6237,0.2207,1.9608,0.5784,2.7053,2.7317,3.0922,4.4897,1.1089,5.4412,0.0127,3.975,0.112,5.9106,2.4003,0.712,3.0294,0.2845,5.2149,2.5263,3.7516,4.4494,8.6924,1.9869,2.0504,5.1799,0.0009,0.7501,1.122,0.8996,2.515,0.7588,3.0955,0.8174,3.4113,6.2836,0.2112,1.7918,1.1273,0.3211,1.7795,5.586,5.7097,0.0374,1.9593,7.1002,7.1827,5.6241,2.8156,3.247,2.4272,1.1684,5.529,1.238,1.4142,1.8577,3.2777,0.3607,3.5716,5.2289,0.0039,4.1229,2.9015,3.6672,2.8283,5.0868,3.7741,1.8113,2.6992,0.8544,3.674,4.5688,5.0333,3.2661,0.616,0.2097,1.2135,6.6604,1.9254,3.6897,6.2998,0.0084,1.777,1.8313,3.017,2.1115,3.4915,4.4893,1.2716,0.6511,4.0509,1.0065,1.2628,4.29,1.9242,8.1829,0.9073,4.4219,0.1131,0.0009,2.3284,0.8532,3.406,3.7261,2.596,5.7946,2.1911,5.8281,1.1339,1.3235,5.2472,3.3171,6.7093,1.7759,2.0481,1.618,1.592,2.0213,3.2426,0.0002,7.5511,0.7051,1.2717,0.5845,5.4011,3.4496,4.0076,1.15,2.5742,2.1749,2.287,3.8582,7.2469,2.2675,0.5427,1.4765,2.3021,2.768,2.9316,3.1254,3.4891,0.2729,0.0511,0.1154,6.6378,3.1951,2.4142,0.3809,2.204,0.0004,3.6638,7.0444,7.4164,1.061,1.6778,0.0567,0.5494,0.8147,2.6865,1.6487,4.2105,2.5524,4.0979,6.8129,3.9106,7.9489,4.5599,0.5925,0.5332,4.2931,3.946,1.4008,4.3983,1.547,0.7081,0.3063,2.2464,0.5948,0.0196,0.0229,2.7549,3.3295,2.4728,0.2269,2.3501,0.6089,0.8253,1.5242,1.7348,0.0564,1.3873,1.9527,0.4926,3.1134,0.661,3.183,0.0007,0.2131,3.9511,0.7391,1.3827,0.6336,4.0382,0.0486,0.1515,0.4464,2.6714,1.9595,3.2076,8.9184,1.0086,2.8006,0.4933,3.4157,4.0429,0.3386,0.1942,0.1118,0.5577,1.0982,2.1864,0.0028,0.0802,1.4106,3.2523,1.2559,3.8115,0.0336,1.3625,1.1884,3.402,0.0477,2.1141,5.0691,2.4883,0.0002,6.9645,1.1887,7.5415,0.8494,0.3742,1.1847,1.1584,3.9926,0.35,3.1989,2.4022,1.3853,1.3741,1.7224,3.5266,6.8762,0.0004,4.0289,3.3097,3.5562,1.3388,5.5855,0.4844,1.8325,1.8856,0.9252,4.5148,3.511,1.5569,0.6954,3.4572,2.6516,3.5843,2.5096,3.9243,1.675,6.4018,3.3366,2.9072,1.8971,2.1866,5.0083,1.7708,2.8751,1.9089,4.559,2.8933,0.5796,5.3626,5.3651,1.7479,1.4019,1.1143,1.0357,3.7143,0.6921,0.0093,3.8372,8.4629,6.2788,1.4834,6.9477,2.3001,2.7203,2.6351,0.0001,1.1505,0.5149,5.1737,3.9856,2.6894,4.6867,1.5998,2.8772,2.0998,2.7771,1.2854,5.2824,0.4958,4.2111,3.1442,1.3418,5.5995,1.2505,2.2512,6.6438,5.2419,1.3231,2.3801,0.6111,0.32,1.8495,2.9752,0.1439,1.0722,0.6459,2.402,2.708,2.3358,2.4213,4.3536,0.4768,1.2441,1.8722,2.6772,2.9132,4.2524,2.2159,4.6125,7.1079,7.2888,2.3179,2.8072,3.0496,0.4695,1.4508,3.2562,0.0755,3.7499,0.9552,2.537,3.2693,4.3084,0.0009,2.3919,0.3192,1.3208,1.6166,1.6989,1.0783,1.8931,1.1112,1.6942,1.2806,0.8479,0.0035,5.8896,0.41,0.2665,1.1946]}
{"prompt":"A man with Alzheimer 's writes letters to himself , pretending to be himself from the future","text":"A man with Alzheimer's writes letters to himself, pretending to be himself from the future, to get answers about what has happened to him. The Alzheimer's patient goes through his life, his regrets and his hopes, in this fictional story he starts to see himself as dead in the future and he has an opportunity to change the future with his own hands. In this case story, the Alzheimer's patient will not be able to change the past, but he can choose where he is going in his future.In this story, the Alzheimer's patient is asked by the doctor what he wants to change in his life.The answer given by this patient is that he has decided to write letters to himself from the future.Now, a person with Alzheimer's disease should never be able to see the present, he will not be able to tell anything about his environment, even about himself.He will only be able to remember.In this case study some techniques will be used in order to help the person with Alzheimer's disease to come back to the present, he will be capable of seeing what is happening to him and even some techniques to help him to remember, what he has done in the past.\nThe first technique is to help him to connect with his future.If we can see him writing letters to himself from the future, he will feel he can take control of his future.Another technique will be to show him his past.In the future, when a person is talking about things that happen in the present, he is talking about his future.If we can show him his past, he will start to feel that his future is still controllable. In the next section we will see some techniques to help the person with Alzheimer's disease.\nIn some countries, when a person with Alzheimer's disease writes a letter to himself from the future, then this is presented to the public so that he can share his future experiences, and the next generations can learn the lessons and the experience from the Alzheimer's patient, they can benefit from the Alzheimer's patient's writing, to see if there is anything in the future they can do.\nTHE AUTHORS\nDr.Hana El -Najjar is a Lecturer at Jordan University of Science and Technology.She has a Degree in English and Business Administration, and a Diploma in Education.

{"prompt":"You are a general in an army in hell , where condemned souls are made to fight an eternal war . You have been here for millennia .","text":"You are a general in an army in hell, where condemned souls are made to fight an eternal war. You have been here for millennia. You are at war with demons, who threaten souls of the living. You are fighting an ancient war between the worlds : the land where they live and the land where the dead rest. You must fight for justice to have any hope to continue to exist. You need a powerful weapon to fight this war. You will receive a gift : a stone, a crystal, it will guide you and will have a mysterious power.\nSadhana has some kind of impact on the individual, for you see the person who is engaged in sadhana changes the character and the behavior of the mind.\nThe practice of sadhana is considered as a life long procedure through which we can get to know our selves and develop the power of our inner world. In this context, sadhana means to \u2018devote yourself\u2019.\nDuring the last twenty years, some people in the West have begun to think about the impact of yoga on health and wellness. This article provides you with some of the key points that are responsible for the popularity of yoga in the Western world.\nMany people today are interested in practicing yoga, whether as a form of fitness, to enhance general wellness, or as part of their religious practice. Because the practice makes a difference to human behavior and overall health, it is interesting that people are interested at this level.\nYoga is an ancient tradition that has seen many different kinds of variations through the centuries. It was a common way for many different types of people to try to achieve personal spiritual goals, and it is very popular in the West because of the many different types of people that practice it.\nOne of the main reasons that people are interested in yoga today is that the practice can help improve a person\u2019s overall condition and well-being. In the Western world, many people see it as an approach to improve physical fitness.\nThere has been little evidence available since the time of yoga\u2019s invention that it can be used as a general physical or mental treatment. However, it is becoming more evident that it can help to improve the mental and spiritual health of an individual.\nOne of the best ways to improve your physical condition is to adopt an exercise routine. There is a lot of evidence that is available to show that regular exercise increases the volume of some hormones in the body that have a positive effect on health.\nIn particular, there has been some evidence that shows that regular exercise can increase the amount of oxytocin in the body. Oxytocin is one of the hormones that have a positive effect on the mental and physical fitness of an individual. Since it is released when a person exercises, it has been considered to increase the mental clarity of an individual.\nAnother important part of physical and mental health is sleep. With a little bit of sleep, people can focus more efficiently on things that are going on around them. With the addition of regular exercise, it becomes even more important that a person gets eight or more hours of sleep each night.\nThe biggest way in which yoga is becoming more popular is that it can be done anywhere and anytime. It is a practice that can be done at any age if it is desired. Many people have found out that it is beneficial to use it as a means of improving their overall mental and physical health.","token_len":696,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,7.5805,4.1692,4.9434,2.4625,4.7932,7.3565,1.5239,4.6315,12.7677,4.8321,1.0344,4.2588,0.8177,5.3355,5.6251,2.1006,1.2076,1.4358,2.4318,2.48,2.2095,4.7975,1.4001,5.4595,1.6903,1.3159,1.355,5.6098,1.7644,0.4921,3.9543,1.3788,3.4198,5.4865,6.8963,2.7452,1.9033,3.8898,0.6578,1.3348,1.0533,3.933,3.3978,3.7118,1.9797,3.2465,1.7924,6.079,11.3399,1.7639,6.7798,5.0136,4.6762,1.9191,1.1019,0.36,2.1278,0.6053,2.3887,2.5556,5.3818,0.2347,1.5405,4.427,2.3281,2.4584,4.9263,4.8834,4.914,2.8904,1.1611,4.8984,4.9785,2.7986,2.9649,0.7637,1.5357,4.2883,2.8483,5.0349,3.6025,1.3496,2.6786,3.2104,0.8917,0.6922,1.4895,3.0877,6.552,1.6517,3.8229,6.2271,1.0525,6.0334,2.88,1.1964,4.2383,0.545,8.4173,1.1266,5.6964,0.1935,3.4903,3.0905,5.4096,1.3738,6.8903,0.7032,1.0412,3.0875,7.0139,9.372,2.1011,4.8521,5.6849,4.2057,0.0481,8.6233,0.3132,1.1546,7.543,2.3667,4.1409,4.1459,4.357,3.7302,4.8057,2.0404,1.9533,8.5647,0.3084,8.5189,4.835,0.1522,8.1071,2.9733,3.5413,2.8842,1.9561,5.2907,0.205,0.7623,6.9257,0.7365,2.0635,2.903,6.6753,0.3094,1.0777,0.0194,0.0012,1.1191,4.4882,2.884,0.9169,5.7245,4.4753,8.1121,6.518,0.7842,3.2126,1.3846,4.5435,2.5627,1.0505,2.061,6.0815,1.632,4.3937,2.57,3.4515,0.9528,1.3565,4.5267,4.1864,0.3844,3.5663,1.8662,4.6547,0.6107,3.1858,0.01,0.0024,4.3983,2.1006,14.0686,6.6729,9.3254,0.6971,2.8824,6.4511,6.2895,3.3343,1.5427,6.2567,0.986,3.7161,4.686,0.3117,0.6024,4.1862,1.6209,2.9232,1.1736,3.7508,0.5797,3.0443,0.3348,3.7102,1.4557,1.3987,5.8327,0.4383,5.1957,0.5701,5.7258,1.0244,2.7015,0.4185,2.9038,3.7717,3.9272,4.5712,0.3706,1.8292,2.2277,0.1115,3.7308,1.9067,1.8936,2.4891,7.802,0.0312,1.3096,5.1044,0.2538,1.1344,1.1487,0.868,2.5554,0.5389,0.4097,0.5979,4.8592,1.0925,4.334,1.9508,4.2792,0.0442,5.0396,0.8345,2.4567,4.6925,3.177,0.5207,3.3252,0.0545,6.5576,1.1554,3.6976,3.8362,6.3309,2.3948,0.8797,0.5058,1.4381,3.6874,0.009,2.4693,4.7846,1.3877,0.2889,5.7578,2.835,1.968,6.7186,2.8902,1.6474,1.6006,4.9818,5.0107,1.365,6.7284,0.6901,0.1733,1.3486,0.4466,6.4277,2.673,2.7285,1.53,2.6362,7.8245,1.6194,3.5891,0.9031,0.8636,4.1515,0.006,1.0811,2.5824,1.875,3.7276,1.4138,1.6486,6.4453,1.7422,2.4087,4.1931,0.0275,6.7314,4.2604,1.4934,0.7085,0.2901,2.3207,1.8566,3.4563,4.1959,4.0597,2.1487,3.5072,3.6329,3.6232,0.0319,0.2095,0.1572,6.03,0.9925,3.1351,4.787,4.2293,2.6549,2.1462,1.9505,1.6562,1.6047,3.6817,2.7284,1.8314,1.447,0.5208,3.8381,1.0308,1.2055,4.5285,1.2011,2.0823,0.051,1.131,2.39,1.6185,0.9496,0.1973,0.7943,3.4411,0.4988,0.0389,2.3086,1.7171,0.7869,1.7065,1.7512,0.361,0.033,0.6488,4.3656,0.125,1.2736,2.6251,1.3002,3.3973,1.8016,3.3288,3.6367,0.1349,8.8951,2.2183,3.3524,4.2743,4.9402,1.4421,3.2359,0.6687,0.0002,0.3054,3.2003,2.189,2.4706,0.5177,0.1515,2.9898,0.4463,4.5393,2.8862,0.0679,1.819,6.1133,0.4317,4.0453,3.8374,2.5491,1.5444,1.8959,3.4192,3.9321,0.1273,5.6794,4.0766,5.5554,6.7498,0.4892,3.9553,0.1576,3.2582,8.056,0.2055,0.1791,4.2448,1.2914,1.8263,1.235,2.3359,1.3173,1.7955,0.343,4.9299,5.2315,4.9396,0.7646,4.8275,0.9892,2.2438,0.0194,2.2362,0.9114,4.0059,1.1968,4.7155,0.1957,1.5026,0.3713,2.026,2.593,0.8929,1.7068,2.623,1.6554,2.0714,1.2126,0.1314,4.7976,0.0252,0.7453,0.5218,3.4243,0.5281,0.0156,3.9521,1.6415,0.6537,1.3913,1.5435,1.6083,3.0759,0.6457,0.4492,6.5694,2.8601,3.9877,2.7661,1.2708,3.6534,1.5134,1.0954,1.7854,0.1267,1.7196,0.5327,4.0391,1.4727,1.9015,0.9808,0.1757,5.2821,0.4503,4.0564,1.4051,7.2759,0.4114,8.0884,5.2601,1.597,0.5387,0.2396,3.3285,4.3212,2.6489,2.0035,0.3116,0.0897,2.3882,0.6913,1.3538,2.9745,4.7287,0.0445,3.049,2.7238,0.0135,2.2162,0.6493,0.2951,7.7086,0.157,1.4601,0.1598,1.2811,1.8181,0.8989,2.4756,0.031,4.7264,0.0101,0.0006,1.0713,0.1542,1.1966,1.0077,3.8341,0.001,0.0015,0.5471,3.4606,0.085,0.0899,1.5731,0.2813,3.6985,1.2402,0.6681,0.1687,0.0549,1.5477,3.6745,1.0837,0.7476,5.2863,0.1187,2.2532,0.0097,0.2058,5.7109,2.0059,0.6011,4.6126,2.3169,2.3054,0.2881,5.4433,0.5373,0.6246,2.8915,2.0132,5.48,1.2735,2.0983,0.8646,3.9795,8.6991,1.1711,1.9688,0.0246,0.7199,0.6297,2.7295,1.7152,3.1973,0.1042,5.1151,3.5367,0.4469,0.4411,0.3165,6.2221,0.2193,5.3703,2.8337,3.4762,2.4976,0.0182,1.8445,0.3582,3.4223,0.9654,4.8202,2.1683,4.275,0.8378,4.7429,1.1536,0.8623,4.0394,0.2683,2.2534,0.0394,0.6502,4.7654,2.5942,3.6271,0.033,4.0857,0.3921,0.2579,2.4179,3.2284,3.778,0.5247,0.8471,1.5208,3.0567,0.0737,4.0737,10.975,3.2111,2.1527,0.068,0.2344,0.374,2.3934,0.2474,0.3018,0.5813,2.5792,5.8349,5.4794,4.224,0.0638,1.5623,2.7804,4.1752,1.2573,0.572,0.7426,1.9595,0.6839,2.3288,2.0383,3.5105,6.1256,2.6772,1.2727,0.3951,2.0911,0.6345,2.2486,2.8142,0.2465,2.0697,0.6401,0.847,3.2602,0.6463,2.9535,6.3126,2.5256,0.2482,5.8947,0.4796,4.0819,0.359,2.4867,2.8748,4.5724,0.3584,1.9411,0.7644,3.616,0.5662,3.0148,2.1234,1.8972,0.337,3.6368,0.629,2.6535,0.8669,3.0143,2.479,0.7647,0.5188,0.4876,0.278]}
{"prompt":"Everyone has superpowers , but the richer you are , the weaker your powers become .","text":"Everyone has superpowers, but the richer you are, the weaker your powers become. For example, when I was a kid I had superpowers like jumping, going through walls, getting in the air as if I were just a fly. So why do I have superpowers?\nI have to say, it started with a little bit of imagination and I always wanted to be able to live in a world where I could fly, walk on water and have the power of invisibility, and so on.\nI have always wanted everything that other people think is impossible. I think it was then (in elementary school) that I thought I had to have superpowers in order to be a hero!\nI always used to have them, but at some point they gave up, probably because they were just a childhood thing. Now I think about them and I tell myself not to worry because when I am big I will be able to get them. I\u2019m still playing with them, but this is my real life. I try to be a good person so that I can get them.\nThere are a few characters, but I think my favourite is that of Xeno, the villain, because he is full of energy.\nI always thought about being a character that had superpowers, but you can\u2019t because they don\u2019t exist in the real world, and if they did I probably wouldn\u2019t play any comic book movies.\nOf course I had superpowers in school, from the moment I was very little. I was the only one at the swimming club that did not know how to swim. So when they asked me to do an exercise I would not do it because I was afraid to get hurt. And I have always had the power of thinking quickly.\n\u201cSuperpowers for All : The Future is Not Enjoyable Unless There Are More People with Superpowers \u201d\nThe world is not fair to people who are different. There are people that are considered normal but have no superpowers, while there are others that have great powers but are a monster to the rest of the world. The same thing goes for people who look normal, but their super powers are different.\nI am a person that has the power of making people understand what I\u2019m saying. I can talk fast without getting angry, and also have the power of going through walls.\n\u201cI have always had Superpowers, but they give up because they are more childhood thoughts. They come back when I grow up and try to be better than who I used to be.\u201d\nWhat would your superpower be? Well I think that being able to fly, I would feel so free to fly over your head. I also think that I would be a good and kind person.\nSome of my bestest memories about growing up and sharing games are the times we had a lot of fun together.\nI would be able to travel between different worlds. There is no time, but it would feel so good to travel in time.\nI am a very funny person, I have a little crazy and I feel like I have superpowers.

{"prompt":"We all know about the living dead . Tell me about the dead living .","text":"We all know about the living dead. Tell me about the dead living. The dead walking. The dead moving.\nDo you have to have a computer to read your paper. No. Your paper doesn\u2019t have to have a computer to be read. Think about that for a minute. What happens when it gets to a bookstore. Can people read these things? Can people actually read a book without a computer and a bookstore? Do you know how many books there are in the world? About 4 billion, and that\u2019s just in bookstores. Even if the 4 billion books were sold every day it couldn\u2019t even cover the books we need to read each day. Think about that for a minute.\nSo. What\u2019s the point in computers. I would look at what kind of bookstores you have in your community and make that your paper. And what books do you have available in your community, not the big novels. What do you have to show? What kind of magazines do you have, and what newspapers do you have in your community.\nWe have an interesting topic tonight. We want to talk about death. I think we\u2019ll start by talking about dying. I would like to talk to a lot about dying. I think it\u2019s important because we all do it. We all die, and then we are left with a big question mark in front of our eyes. What will that mean to us and to our lives. I\u2019m going to start by talking about someone who died last week.\nI\u2019d like to introduce you to Dr. James F. Knott. He\u2019s a family physician with a practice in Sacramento. He was a member of the National Medical Association all of his life. He had a son that died from an undiagnosed and untreated cancer at the age of thirty and fourteen months. Here\u2019s his story.\nHe asked, \u201c Will people die from a stroke or a cardiac arrest or something else? Will you feel any real difference in your ability to do anything tomorrow or a few days from now, or will this just be gone from you and you\u2019ll just be like a normal person again.\u201d\nI said, \u201c Why don\u2019t you ask your physician. Let him give you the report. Give me the report.\u201d So he went and asked the doctor. And he said \u201c I found some swelling in your brain. I had trouble with your eyesight. I found that you couldn\u2019t hold your head up all the time.\u201d\nI said \u201c I don\u2019t remember you telling me my son was dead. I just know it. I know it from my son\u2019s body. Is it possible to really know your son is dead? I mean, is it possible to really be sure, because you know that when he died he was the most alert, happy, and healthy kid that I\u2019ve ever known. So I don\u2019t understand all of this. Why don\u2019t you ask my son what he wants. Let him give you his message. Give me the message. Is it possible, when he was awake, could he say he wanted to die? Can you be sure that he doesn\u2019t still want to be with us?

{"prompt":"Stars - Your Ex-Lover is Dead","text":"Stars - Your Ex-Lover is Dead, You're In Love with the Next One. We all do it. It was an interesting one, though, seeing how they took over the house where that crazy psycho killed all her friends. Maybe we should start watching Glee and not just the show. But then again, all they are looking for is another way to get people into the theatre and money to pay the salaries. As I write this I am sure in another week\/month we will be hearing, \"We need to take out a life insurance policy on that monster girl for the amount she might cost the company\". Now that's the kind of thinking I hate.\nSo the other thing I think we are missing is the human element. We are the heroes, you see. We're the real deal now. We're the ones that got us into this mess. Maybe we can have a real talk with the kids once the show is over, and we can try to get them to do the right thing in this disaster scenario.\nWe have to do this together. We can't let the monster win. But if we all do the right thing, then we don't need to do all this. We can take out the death benefit and live happily ever after. And that way the company won't need life insurance. It's the perfect package.\nThere are two types of people in the world. The first is the one who makes you feel good. They make you feel alive, full, warm, special. They make you smile and laugh and give you hope. They give you a reason to believe in a better future. They make you feel like a better person. The second type are the ones that try to take everything away from you. They make you cry and make things so difficult that the only thing you can do with it is to hurt and to be angry.\nI love my friends who make me feel good. I love the ones who give me hope that the future is going to be brighter, they tell me that even though the future is bumpy, that they will be there for me as their rock and as their friend. I love the ones that make me laugh, that tell me all kinds of silly and non-silly jokes, that tell me I look hot, that tell me I have a great smile, that tell me I can do anything, that tell me they wish they were me, that I am smart, pretty and unique. I love them.\nI love the ones that make me feel special, that tell me \"I love you\" and \"I wish we were together again\". I love the ones who tell me \"my baby\" and who are the first to stop what they are doing to get there to see me. I love the ones who tell me \"I have been thinking about you\". They are the ones who love you and want you to feel the same way.\nSo if you are my friend, please be that type, please try to give us a reason to smile and a reason to believe that one day something is going to be a little easier, that one day we are going to be a little happier. I bet you wouldn't have anything to do with me if we were not going to share this life together.\nSo I love my friends, my sweet friends. If you are one of my friends, I hope you are as happy and as happy as possible.","token_len":698,"entropy":[5.5272,7.081,6.0275,3.8314,7.5743,3.7708,5.1716,2.8056,4.7989,3.7738,0.6468,3.4104,1.1363,1.1996,4.2765,8.5516,2.7593,5.5298,4.5677,4.4381,4.5819,1.9244,1.0773,3.0077,3.7782,3.7208,3.9053,3.7951,1.6303,3.7034,1.2391,5.4743,1.3903,4.2941,4.0171,4.5215,1.3075,6.1976,5.7184,5.4983,7.1465,8.0998,6.9794,3.5288,3.9624,1.0949,0.784,5.7432,2.879,1.2238,3.999,5.0505,7.6357,1.8021,2.8237,4.2747,2.6327,3.5402,2.78,0.725,4.3928,3.6623,1.3755,0.2075,5.4156,3.8877,4.2931,6.3255,0.4702,0.2678,4.6731,4.229,0.1671,2.3062,3.2434,3.4979,1.6727,7.0931,2.0102,7.6819,2.8875,1.7702,2.6388,4.9765,1.3835,5.5956,3.0465,4.6994,0.1875,2.0206,1.7943,5.7971,6.1111,4.9692,3.3814,6.5914,1.1345,2.3479,0.7243,2.219,2.7606,6.0938,1.0323,3.941,2.7777,0.8946,3.7023,4.0873,2.4429,7.0776,0.4932,0.1818,1.7913,3.685,7.1855,4.8129,5.1995,2.1492,7.4935,2.7225,5.7048,2.8879,3.7319,4.165,2.8324,5.4581,2.6865,2.129,3.4519,3.3019,0.0033,5.993,2.1021,7.2885,0.8788,1.2487,6.8466,3.9889,4.0003,1.1787,1.342,3.7288,1.8233,3.4833,1.9982,0.7501,1.4181,6.581,1.3009,1.0547,2.1846,1.2143,3.9504,5.8192,1.9224,4.9733,2.3223,0.9002,1.5277,3.6306,0.8301,5.1039,2.6553,6.691,0.6897,1.2553,1.8557,1.0206,2.0511,1.8906,4.6053,3.9911,2.0677,0.7806,2.9447,0.8806,5.076,1.2715,2.4859,4.3983,1.2207,4.2972,4.1974,2.5831,1.469,5.1674,5.3985,2.4012,2.5874,1.1323,0.5135,1.7978,2.5564,2.2529,0.5698,4.2986,0.5416,2.4498,1.9788,0.5792,3.5737,2.3418,2.114,0.2486,3.6599,2.9502,8.4559,4.3323,0.4799,1.9342,3.3946,2.4676,1.4347,3.0184,2.0987,3.3058,0.5945,1.3374,2.6243,2.0229,2.4261,1.8478,4.4682,5.4314,0.6529,3.504,2.79,0.5847,4.149,2.4814,2.4716,0.0761,0.0348,1.0481,1.9487,1.1303,5.273,0.0006,1.1949,0.7384,3.3789,3.7918,1.333,2.1597,1.1807,1.2999,4.047,3.3867,1.7121,4.86,4.2359,1.2706,5.6149,3.641,0.0282,0.0275,0.3663,3.2059,2.4418,4.6723,2.8969,4.0152,3.4344,0.015,3.7382,9.3252,0.0203,1.3549,2.7899,1.2572,3.0653,5.7473,7.0267,1.0231,1.0273,4.6361,1.2831,3.2236,4.7256,0.0183,1.8027,2.0715,1.4407,1.26,1.1122,1.5316,2.8548,1.0923,1.069,4.0928,0.7345,4.32,4.0362,1.9666,2.051,1.1039,2.5765,3.1859,0.175,0.6177,6.6941,2.0605,7.2609,4.8885,6.0764,0.7219,7.3136,0.9031,1.523,0.9003,0.0881,4.7721,1.6752,2.4573,0.981,4.3664,0.0977,2.5962,0.5249,1.273,2.8502,0.0514,1.9326,3.7244,0.2144,2.7464,1.3243,4.0584,3.3288,1.3399,0.5052,1.2027,1.4199,0.0711,0.6723,1.7916,1.7681,2.9739,0.1713,0.7211,3.3706,0.7772,0.9357,3.3978,0.5034,0.5322,2.2728,4.9604,0.1222,3.1415,2.9928,1.3157,0.3028,0.1664,0.5333,1.0081,1.7558,0.055,4.4541,1.3106,3.6449,7.6635,2.8509,2.7449,0.9088,3.9694,1.6286,1.3198,0.5974,0.4236,0.4321,6.1277,1.8018,0.1654,1.6355,6.4216,3.4975,3.1634,3.0117,2.4952,0.6675,1.2793,2.4196,3.7561,3.6329,3.1831,3.4421,3.1205,0.4856,0.7912,1.5847,0.5499,1.0062,0.5009,2.1766,2.5326,0.3746,3.2376,0.1082,1.0486,3.9956,3.4338,3.06,1.4076,3.1297,0.1429,0.3404,2.4592,1.8266,6.8408,5.1201,0.0243,1.4375,5.1842,0.7664,2.87,2.227,0.6476,8.4891,0.3083,0.783,3.3621,2.529,1.828,2.009,1.5585,0.8145,0.1014,3.9725,6.3042,7.1285,2.4619,8.348,2.0396,3.9925,0.7171,1.4574,0.8138,1.1977,0.4516,1.9499,2.0279,0.1276,3.1872,1.9811,3.5507,3.4637,0.0165,6.153,4.1141,0.0063,5.5127,3.96,6.6062,0.2541,4.9867,3.7675,3.0785,2.0975,0.6442,1.5891,0.0136,3.0956,4.9936,6.9084,1.4639,0.5697,2.7724,0.0072,1.0198,2.3858,1.3956,2.6463,3.6811,0.8027,0.2796,0.8929,0.0072,0.7397,2.2981,2.3829,0.6795,1.5955,0.5803,1.3145,0.0056,4.4742,7.6542,1.9206,2.4871,3.7416,1.3248,0.4681,2.045,3.2044,6.1337,0.6188,6.6635,1.6685,6.6929,0.7353,1.3071,0.3037,2.0512,1.1692,1.2092,1.3727,0.9205,1.2015,0.5839,1.005,1.533,0.1089,0.8882,3.5602,1.759,0.773,1.6212,0.0121,6.6535,1.4313,1.912,0.2117,2.3505,0.8981,1.0856,0.4877,4.2792,3.6963,1.2864,2.3338,2.6454,0.9198,0.7875,0.1435,0.5488,0.1483,0.9448,2.4995,0.046,1.5595,6.0724,4.663,4.0939,0.3394,7.3427,3.3187,2.6401,3.6694,0.9739,5.0238,6.5479,0.5568,0.527,0.0822,1.9465,3.6465,4.8673,5.892,3.8242,1.1602,1.0734,0.5705,0.0827,0.3105,0.1286,0.4788,1.5851,0.0478,0.9771,1.3111,3.9957,3.7117,4.314,0.5883,1.2275,4.2679,3.3108,2.0047,0.6851,0.3979,0.5182,4.3848,3.381,1.5215,2.481,1.3697,0.3149,3.7177,2.8578,0.4409,0.3448,0.7489,1.3755,2.9598,3.1877,0.9208,1.7342,6.0234,0.6396,0.5917,3.1662,3.4756,4.806,6.2196,4.1685,1.6929,4.9412,0.443,3.6935,3.8357,1.7433,1.4655,0.3225,4.4316,0.8974,4.5896,0.6676,0.0611,4.8986,1.4605,6.3729,0.2616,5.3798,1.6946,0.1515,0.0054,2.0125,4.7927,2.6589,4.7092,2.7776,1.6982,2.4377,0.1548,1.7797,2.0704,0.5842,0.0098,1.2349,3.3171,0.6058,2.4816,1.6851,2.3839,6.0895,1.1966,5.5571,0.0013,2.5666,5.0957,0.9577,1.5149,0.1026,2.6142,1.2148,2.601,1.668,2.3704,4.4357,0.4104,7.1493,2.0217,4.3734,3.6073,0.3145,1.1355,2.9562,2.6025,2.3551,2.5506,0.5166,1.823,2.8591,7.2103,1.3003,0.8296,3.9057,0.5971,1.5667,2.9182,0.1158,2.703,0.3943,0.4683,2.9602,2.0195,0.4405,2.0581,3.435,0.9069,2.9073,2.4564,1.2043,0.2791,5.8265,0.5027]}
{"prompt":"You are a commercial airliner pilot . The moment before you turn your phone off to begin the flight your SO sends you a deeply concerning text .","text":"You are a commercial airliner pilot. The moment before you turn your phone off to begin the flight your SO sends you a deeply concerning text. Should the SO respond to the text immediately or should you make the call?\nWhile I would never do any harm to my SO on the phone I would expect her or him to treat my phone calls with the same courtesy I would expect them to treat my face-to-face conversations. This means that while I'm on the phone I treat them like they're talking to me, not just to another woman. I'm not expecting that to go unnoticed and appreciated, but I expect it to go without it. Not that anyone of us expects their SO to actually do the same with the other women in their lives or that anyone of us should ever let ourselves think that it would be appropriate to do so.\nI have gotten a few texts that I've felt like I should respond to but haven't felt so compelled to. Sometimes I'm thinking, \"Oh no, I don't want to be the type of woman who expects a return call\" or \"I have SO many things to do that I never have time to deal with calls.\" But then I think, \"No, not responding is just leaving that text up on the phone. It just gets worse and worse. It is my choice to text or call.\" It took me a long time to realize that because I can (and sometimes want to) spend my life avoiding a bad situation. Because I can stay strong and do nothing instead of putting something in writing, I choose to do that because it's often very difficult to do otherwise.\nI think the message you are receiving is not a bad one. I don't think your SO wants you to respond to this sort of text, but they are also not expecting it. And the thing is, when you do respond, people are going to think badly of you. When you do not respond, they are going to think you will get angry with them and it's not acceptable behavior. The reality is that you have to choose either to take what they send you and act on it (as you say you want to), or respond and it is only going to make it worse.\nI agree that a text is not the way to communicate to your SO, but if it means you will be able to deal with it once your turn is up on the phone, or it is at least consistent throughout the day, I could do that. I could also be disrespectful and rude back to the guy to show him that he can't take advantage of me that way (or whatever kind of thing that might get), but I would feel more comfortable doing that. And I don't think that it is a big deal for him to think that you are angry with him for his text, particularly if you don't respond to his messages in any way.\nI would tell my SO that it's ok for them not to want to answer unless their own needs are getting in the way of responding.

{"prompt":"`` There are seven schools of magic : Fire , Wind , Water , Earth , Light , Dark , and Bread . Choose wisely . ''","text":"`` There are seven schools of magic : Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, Light, Dark, and Bread. Choose wisely. '' : '' [... ] It makes sense in a book where everything is built from scratch. Here you have a bunch of monsters from an old-school RPG, that can do a little bit of magic, even if they are supposed to be a bit \" dumber than they used to be \".\nOn the other hand, it makes more sense in a setting where the rules are designed, so that a certain kind of magic takes place, and doesn't allow you to do anything else. When you need the magic, if you don't have it, you get stuck. In fact, it makes a huge leap.\nSo, the only way to use this in a setting like BSG ( where everything is very clearly explained and the rules for magic are very specific and detailed, and it's almost entirely absent from other games I know of ) would be to make a custom game mechanic using the same rules that made up a spell.\nIs that possible?\nTo the best of my knowlege, no. The book that I was reading just had a few lines on each witch, giving them an icon of their school and what magic they could do, and there were several times where an old magic ritual was being done. Of course there was no real description, even in a \" wizard's guide to the Galaxy \", and I don't remember much on how much power a certain level of witch summoned or the cost. But, as far as I read it, there were certain kinds of magic spells, or summoning spells, and different powers.\nYou could do it that way. You have to use it just like any other spell. If it involves a ritual, you do it like everyone else, you summon some demons or angels, or something to help you. But don't think of it as any kind of magic.\nIt would be interesting, if it was a custom mechanic built around specific game mechanics. Just keep it simple. If something happened with a ritual, you don't have to explain exactly what it did, just what caused the magic to happen.\nOtherwise you might run into problems with it. If it was an important mechanic that all the users of the game were to know about, some of them might be forced to put it aside, or put it in the back of their mind.\nIf you want to try anything, at least give some interesting results. Maybe it's even possible to build something which looks like a kind of spell, but acts differently.\nI think you're saying : \" Just keep something weird or different about it, not as an enhancement or improvement, but as a way of making things special to it all on its own. \"\nIt certainly seems to be on the mind of those who write books and game mechanics. For example the book by Brandon Sanderson where it's explained how to make any spell work.\nI agree, but I can think of several good examples where such \" special powers \" are mentioned only as an effect of the game rules, not as a separate thing. At the end they just work to help or hinder the game.\nThe only way I can think of what you have is to take magic in to the dark side. Like the book in which the whole story has to do with a witch called Topheth who creates other wizards by binding them together.","token_len":701,"entropy":[7.6228,1.2189,5.9264,5.9774,2.2305,4.924,7.6221,6.9411,0.4753,4.6091,0.0512,0.9029,0.2126,2.0364,0.4788,3.58,0.4813,2.2693,0.4748,1.293,13.352,0.5818,5.7719,6.2754,1.2149,7.6493,4.687,4.3272,5.7077,5.6634,3.0435,5.8194,4.8866,3.9952,4.7169,2.0698,5.2679,3.5615,4.373,0.6446,6.4918,2.9157,2.9155,0.784,5.5566,2.9251,1.8874,1.4334,4.924,0.0026,5.2325,4.3729,4.5924,2.1364,3.267,1.2897,3.8138,2.0079,5.0891,2.9103,3.7458,2.8951,4.9125,1.1097,0.2613,1.5482,1.5587,5.4301,1.4103,1.2026,1.9063,6.6396,0.0028,0.433,3.2952,2.5322,5.3173,12.0311,3.7729,1.9788,2.9287,4.5666,0.0046,0.0373,2.5379,3.3381,9.8499,0.8919,0.7678,0.0559,0.1079,3.0349,1.8787,3.7488,0.0043,1.2217,0.3819,6.0667,0.3203,2.2257,4.8427,0.728,4.4842,5.2794,3.2515,1.1577,3.6041,4.1785,2.8679,0.0072,1.3801,5.1051,0.7377,1.9162,1.3044,4.9347,0.0009,6.2403,2.453,0.0354,2.5301,1.4862,2.1656,0.5895,5.1073,1.0607,5.1438,4.0473,2.4022,0.9626,5.3577,0.501,2.752,0.0018,0.9005,1.6889,0.5619,0.7709,3.7416,3.1621,1.2273,3.6326,3.9231,0.0464,2.3894,2.3558,3.0415,3.805,7.7131,3.8851,1.7016,4.1111,1.2206,3.0293,3.9085,1.1989,0.4934,4.328,2.9491,4.3821,0.7862,2.2058,2.61,12.0903,3.7007,3.8299,8.759,4.0941,0.3864,7.0623,6.1418,4.6431,1.9774,3.0795,1.1423,5.0087,1.9748,0.5324,2.8002,4.3997,1.4221,3.3251,2.3015,1.2855,3.0636,1.2915,4.055,3.9555,7.0784,0.6705,4.2877,1.5196,6.7608,3.0942,0.2378,3.1326,2.7612,0.0718,0.2284,2.6974,1.4962,6.5725,1.8578,6.7626,5.6822,1.7348,2.6536,1.4186,2.9223,5.7834,3.7884,3.9238,6.4914,2.68,1.566,6.2653,2.0639,2.5367,0.3999,1.0119,4.9941,4.1548,0.7043,0.0112,0.0326,8.7787,2.9876,0.1989,2.363,0.4748,2.6096,5.7298,4.8518,1.1292,3.1497,2.4809,5.0743,4.0606,1.3416,2.8857,5.0718,3.9676,3.5337,9.0799,1.5761,5.6055,3.229,3.4282,6.0614,2.8864,2.0304,5.1532,2.8068,3.7914,3.8293,0.4277,2.6478,1.6929,1.5059,0.9222,3.7259,1.2197,3.6051,4.8858,1.3456,6.1105,4.6186,4.1337,7.5661,1.5596,4.65,3.0645,1.9125,5.5297,0.0794,3.6523,1.6118,1.4875,4.2253,5.7094,2.3398,5.5282,3.122,2.8054,4.0199,6.821,2.3649,5.4113,3.9341,2.5636,11.8862,3.0266,2.5028,2.1868,2.5351,0.0004,3.2612,3.0331,4.3905,1.4024,3.535,4.8897,2.5945,4.4847,5.2634,0.6198,3.1959,9.5833,2.9658,4.0311,5.1938,4.0106,2.4934,2.9268,3.4112,1.9406,0.0012,0.3146,8.6043,1.1893,0.23,2.3553,1.5509,5.4719,5.4512,0.0066,1.1392,2.676,2.4402,4.48,7.7814,1.0705,0.7631,2.0381,5.7405,4.1561,1.8773,1.3552,4.4819,2.1491,4.0808,3.2854,5.1043,0.0209,1.4286,2.8006,5.2256,0.9637,3.3751,3.3849,5.3442,1.2626,2.2437,0.197,0.8876,1.1523,3.3483,2.6535,6.9267,1.8141,6.1205,0.6545,1.2296,4.1245,0.6856,3.7836,6.5214,0.3537,1.832,3.7422,6.339,3.9353,5.0623,2.8507,5.3946,0.688,2.1863,2.2994,4.3774,3.5707,0.5447,2.609,2.5033,5.6326,0.0004,3.6225,1.9316,0.5831,0.3899,4.3126,1.0864,0.0015,0.6641,1.1851,1.9693,3.2476,2.7871,0.7744,3.3623,2.8787,1.6072,1.9294,1.967,2.7993,4.3472,4.6986,6.4078,2.417,4.6704,5.4346,0.4398,0.9958,6.0405,6.3707,2.7523,0.9522,1.025,3.3391,4.2815,4.2857,3.8049,1.3267,5.1735,0.5702,1.3535,3.0523,0.001,1.3667,0.2242,3.1989,4.9156,0.6938,1.042,2.443,0.83,2.6505,3.2697,7.2556,2.3818,1.9473,0.7318,0.8496,0.5447,1.4303,6.7516,3.1419,2.5793,5.1032,0.097,1.5915,2.1348,2.0901,0.6561,2.729,2.3252,2.0408,3.1575,4.3992,6.2123,2.1755,6.6796,1.3227,5.7239,1.1649,0.7697,0.5619,2.9986,6.1289,2.9354,0.8014,0.2175,5.6451,1.5227,1.0906,0.7783,2.0467,5.3807,0.1512,4.7332,1.1088,3.6086,1.8664,1.4868,4.0845,0.2658,1.7679,2.1026,3.4078,0.2055,0.5541,2.3055,1.5053,1.2176,3.0552,1.2681,2.5548,0.3398,3.6357,6.3109,1.16,5.7847,0.3531,3.8893,2.8506,7.5743,4.9176,0.5174,4.1404,2.3826,1.0124,5.9097,2.2154,0.4465,3.5112,2.594,5.283,4.3217,1.1193,1.0406,6.4116,0.0018,4.3285,1.3787,1.0986,7.8034,3.554,1.3601,1.1316,2.3354,2.4436,3.0814,2.409,4.2115,6.7563,1.4481,6.7803,2.1985,6.2475,10.4509,3.3858,3.5569,4.216,0.5031,1.1065,4.741,4.3942,3.7909,7.4474,2.1732,5.2588,1.4563,1.1861,0.8282,0.5899,2.5467,1.1522,2.0377,2.4875,6.531,3.5331,5.0721,6.5386,6.0958,0.9024,0.0011,1.8423,1.4245,0.5723,3.517,5.6265,2.0608,1.4536,1.1974,5.1953,0.8232,4.9059,0.0875,4.0491,0.6682,3.9164,3.6125,3.2322,5.2304,1.514,1.2439,5.5253,1.0291,4.9641,3.8942,4.4003,7.0386,0.3241,0.0004,5.3215,3.7236,1.8328,2.9808,1.6352,1.2011,1.9525,5.7538,2.9591,2.0137,2.0155,1.3193,2.0853,4.8799,1.9857,1.619,1.0223,3.6443,4.314,0.0553,3.5024,4.7446,1.4891,2.4739,4.9494,4.4007,5.8502,4.472,0.2993,2.6713,3.9546,6.4211,3.0024,3.0951,4.6564,1.5267,1.8218,3.0585,6.0162,1.5276,2.6357,0.4643,1.108,5.2371,2.6897,0.5092,6.5705,1.6346,1.4094,6.9405,3.8949,6.0793,4.65,4.5248,4.0653,2.3486,1.2364,2.2208,0.9911,0.8237,3.1426,3.4525,1.8749,2.5317,1.0552,0.6077,0.0191,6.2248,3.2025,4.3483,3.2282,1.0872,3.9909,6.2684,3.4688,4.2873,1.8512,7.3637,1.2328,2.1911,5.6268,2.5232,3.5316,3.4523,2.4461,1.867,5.6806,3.5022,5.2855,2.0698,2.3156,0.061,3.1181,2.9751,4.0617,10.202,5.7954,4.7843,2.7942,5.4234,7.2681,4.2882,3.9686,6.7924,1.0407,0.9382,1.1241]}
{"prompt":"Write a poem from the living to a deceased loved\/cherished one .","text":"Write a poem from the living to a deceased loved\/cherished one. A poem that speaks about hope, life, love. What does it say to the person who you can still send your heart out to?\nFor me, this kind of poetry could be an ode to a loved one that died. So, I\u2019ve decided to write an odes dedicated to the ones that died in my life. Maybe one day one of them will read my post. I hope it happens. In the meanwhile, as far as I know, there is only one person that has taken me to his grave. I\u2019m sure my poem will be sent to him in the universe.\nThe more people we know. The more lives we see. And the more lives we see. The more we know about love and life. The more we know about loss and death. The more we see people crying and the less we cry. The more we see people laughing and the more we laugh. The more we see people trying and the more we try.\nHere at The Ranchhouse, there is a lot of stuff going on. I\u2019m back to my blogging, writing, my painting, drawing, creating, learning more \u2026 I can\u2019t wait to share what I\u2019m doing with you soon.\nOne of the beautiful things about painting is when the painting reveals itself. There isn\u2019t any painting that could be better than an honest painting. The painting is perfect in its own way and it doesn\u2019t need anyone to explain what or how it is or how it works. There is just something about that painting that I enjoy. That kind of paint reveals it the way no one else can.\nRecently I painted a painting that is one of the greatest examples of me revealing to you a part of me. One that I hope you enjoy.\nRecently I painted this painting. A lady is standing out on her own in a field of flowers. She is standing in the center of the painting, her back towards the viewer. Her back and arms are outstretched. She faces the viewer, with a smile on her face. She holds a bouquet that has many flowers in it, including one large red rose.\nI want to let you know a few things about this painting. Its composition, colours and the way it appears to you, might change a lot as I paint more of that painting.\nThe lady is a small, very tiny bit in the paint, because the face is small. The body is the big, fat, round, full figure. I have to go round and round about in my painting when I\u2019m painting a head and shoulders and trying to figure out what kind of angle to take. I am a tiny bit worried about turning down the head of the lady because it is so tiny. But its composition is the biggest part of the painting. It has to be the right way. It\u2019s the overall structure.\nThere is so much going on in this painting. Its composition is very simple, the background is a field of flowers, but they could be whatever. It could be a field of grasses, or it could be a field of leaves all around the lady, or it could be a field of snow. I am not worried about what\u2019s in the background. I\u2019m just making sure that the main characters are properly placed in their space.","token_len":701,"entropy":[4.0641,6.9561,3.1141,1.5393,6.4991,3.7206,2.9887,5.64,6.0744,11.4646,11.0366,0.0735,2.3579,1.3199,4.0805,1.2057,2.8105,5.6492,3.8907,6.8942,1.1212,4.6585,0.3552,1.7937,3.1004,5.2355,2.9522,1.4491,1.7359,2.9011,3.1698,2.962,0.9888,5.0134,4.6898,5.203,5.7009,2.3947,3.352,4.7976,0.5416,0.8823,1.549,9.4662,2.7443,0.3773,2.2997,4.9099,0.0135,2.0753,5.1992,0.8565,3.7505,6.0789,0.2993,0.0843,3.0352,3.284,0.1695,3.125,3.7969,2.1196,5.7101,1.7291,1.6299,16.8663,7.5207,2.1987,3.0179,0.2382,1.4451,3.7124,1.1585,4.9309,7.8055,0.0394,1.8218,6.7086,1.187,1.8052,3.0376,0.8008,0.6999,0.5206,6.1608,3.8033,0.8245,4.9859,1.5813,1.4452,0.2129,4.3648,2.328,6.6052,1.6696,2.2635,1.5668,2.486,6.5133,0.9098,5.3574,0.7807,4.2854,0.1459,4.6905,4.2184,0.0116,0.8112,1.8355,0.4655,2.3335,1.2087,3.5119,0.1474,2.6558,2.1111,2.8869,5.5923,2.8093,2.003,5.6605,2.212,1.1886,2.0357,3.8756,0.3387,1.724,3.4859,5.2288,2.6099,0.7418,1.3894,5.7076,0.645,0.9753,3.4952,1.0188,8.8719,0.8472,1.2574,3.5341,6.1555,3.077,4.3524,3.4426,6.3232,0.8679,0.2955,5.249,0.22,4.3564,0.6672,2.9749,0.9357,0.2234,3.7358,0.1579,2.9902,1.5479,2.3593,0.1435,1.7587,2.3063,2.193,4.0496,1.5897,3.0567,0.8304,1.4548,0.0853,0.4459,0.7819,0.3161,5.8372,0.7186,2.5871,0.3819,0.6993,0.051,0.1426,2.7638,4.3167,6.2211,1.6255,4.4276,3.4325,0.4426,5.2139,0.5239,0.6928,0.1682,0.167,0.4128,1.4195,5.2131,0.6928,0.7743,1.096,0.1374,2.6345,0.252,0.4266,0.0552,0.0987,0.1739,0.8238,4.9627,3.4422,4.7553,0.5063,0.2856,0.177,1.5828,2.1704,5.6565,4.5485,3.0966,9.3677,6.6144,0.7998,4.0657,0.9659,1.1482,1.9639,0.5236,4.6769,2.2488,0.0314,1.1438,2.0552,3.8025,0.2418,0.875,7.6258,2.0751,2.6795,5.6553,3.0637,3.4946,1.2511,6.1289,5.6917,0.6699,4.8714,0.5397,5.0118,1.4024,4.8664,3.4125,7.8136,1.9846,3.9071,3.7829,0.5703,0.0115,1.3337,0.4312,1.6525,4.2709,0.4091,2.7692,0.1042,1.9955,1.0396,1.1348,0.427,5.8735,0.3824,1.1823,4.9629,1.1282,0.4459,6.1482,0.0777,0.091,4.1205,0.3743,4.7446,3.3391,3.0278,6.3974,1.8548,1.1969,3.8183,4.7124,1.3392,1.0365,0.0098,2.5918,4.0878,0.8476,4.6288,1.9395,3.8898,0.8492,5.2532,4.5616,4.8587,0.4753,2.8602,2.1832,1.4621,6.2212,3.6837,1.8019,2.1443,0.6584,3.2099,1.7104,3.8431,0.4893,0.1537,0.0678,2.187,4.8915,1.0388,4.2548,2.7346,7.2896,1.4253,0.9012,1.6648,3.982,1.3543,0.284,1.5387,0.2367,3.4451,0.7434,3.252,2.2583,1.7474,3.4389,0.5449,0.4398,2.7774,5.4202,1.0258,3.7737,5.4222,0.0016,3.38,5.9025,5.1417,5.5662,0.5981,6.4741,1.1044,1.0607,1.4615,0.3443,1.2533,7.5537,1.1491,4.1947,1.0261,2.0899,1.7135,2.6032,4.6273,0.1787,0.7231,4.1688,4.2688,0.1668,5.9884,7.5139,4.8271,2.1835,3.4665,4.1584,0.0937,1.4665,1.5459,4.6869,1.9344,1.8591,3.2561,1.0539,4.1659,0.9064,1.3946,7.5056,0.3888,0.737,4.8298,1.0051,1.6808,4.2095,8.296,3.2402,2.3871,5.3882,2.3137,2.2324,3.7644,3.1295,1.5925,3.4202,2.1319,1.5941,0.6563,1.2768,1.0253,2.8217,1.6855,1.4974,2.7961,0.2922,0.6726,3.6612,1.7836,3.1513,4.2462,5.0075,0.6112,2.9939,0.4776,2.4186,2.3391,3.4333,2.3786,0.5744,4.3363,0.4299,1.4308,1.6222,6.5769,0.8581,0.3959,1.7893,4.109,2.1518,1.9897,0.943,0.0213,0.0398,0.3334,1.6413,3.6651,2.1952,4.06,0.0005,3.1859,2.6962,6.0024,1.1509,1.7073,0.2612,1.9613,4.5688,2.0985,5.7665,4.4216,2.3871,0.727,1.9054,2.7789,3.737,0.4544,5.0113,0.24,0.4906,5.7091,2.2451,0.4654,0.4909,0.7645,0.3407,0.4024,7.0227,4.0294,2.7172,7.2466,0.8786,2.1502,2.1197,0.5763,4.6835,2.6137,1.3373,3.9214,7.0182,3.5767,2.2197,0.8894,3.6692,2.4755,2.1991,2.2843,2.5978,4.4318,0.4949,0.253,1.5018,1.8913,6.832,1.2399,3.589,4.9043,2.6972,3.9098,5.2058,5.7166,4.5049,1.2788,6.233,1.5726,5.8006,2.3633,6.0964,1.2906,3.944,0.6384,1.8201,4.7918,0.384,4.1609,4.4012,1.9198,4.8763,1.5923,4.2021,1.5761,5.8446,5.9051,1.0822,3.3437,2.4941,3.5775,4.665,6.405,0.6634,0.3981,4.6381,4.4729,2.3097,1.0229,5.9077,0.4629,8.0176,0.1891,0.1932,1.2175,2.975,8.0087,2.4988,2.3638,2.7359,7.7131,0.2224,2.8875,0.0693,0.9281,3.6847,0.0108,8.0304,2.1188,2.1164,2.2628,1.7456,3.5349,3.264,4.3194,0.5141,6.5637,0.6776,6.7225,5.4158,0.8024,3.5101,2.7366,0.5966,2.0074,3.0224,2.1912,1.1981,1.8216,2.5319,0.5557,2.5558,6.2098,2.8906,1.2423,3.4675,4.7092,1.9688,0.411,1.3592,0.1356,0.5279,1.8246,3.0008,3.1383,0.7137,3.0161,3.1033,2.0159,1.2953,2.0212,3.9792,0.1187,0.1868,1.3914,8.1778,5.1183,1.5783,1.4785,3.6152,0.7637,3.7258,0.1662,2.9817,0.0181,1.1975,0.9566,0.087,0.7534,4.7498,1.5146,0.8692,2.6786,1.8599,1.8283,3.5538,5.9878,0.7432,3.6677,8.9075,0.4583,0.5127,1.0194,3.188,5.5871,6.7599,1.0123,8.2365,3.2001,1.8926,2.1841,0.2217,1.4907,4.4982,0.2542,4.7146,3.9921,0.9293,1.8078,2.144,0.023,0.0312,0.8969,0.538,0.0439,4.1569,7.587,1.9474,1.8931,4.4397,2.2848,1.388,0.5587,0.0128,0.0447,0.7947,0.4897,0.0764,5.2641,1.3227,2.187,2.9041,1.9107,3.6706,0.1985,3.5383,12.3745,0.2109,0.4716,3.0086,0.9293,0.7431,0.8662,0.7918,3.4577,0.0374,0.2605,2.0417,4.4816,1.2814,1.0787,1.4839,6.7186,3.3175,0.984,6.3061,2.9673,1.868,2.5079,6.3238,0.6544]}
{"prompt":"You arrive in heaven\/hell and find out you get one phone call ...","text":"You arrive in heaven\/hell and find out you get one phone call... to pick a spot. One spot in heaven or hell! This is one of those questions that makes the Bible seem pointless. Well, maybe, if you believe the Bible is word for word accurate about what it says about heaven and hell. But that\u2019s a small price to pay. But I think it\u2019s worth it. In fact, if you believe something is true, even if you can\u2019t explain why, I\u2019ll pray that God will give you the light. It\u2019s not so important that you know why you were saved, but it is important that you know how. It means, in order to understand God\u2019s purpose, we have to understand the universe (and other humans), and the Bible is a very important part of the universe and how humans live together.\nI believe in God. There are so many reasons: the way He created the universe, the way He is with the human race on earth, the way He is with the suffering and hurting in the world. But I believe he is real.\nMy daughter, a teenager, who has always had a hard time understanding me, was in tears when she read Jesus\u2019 parable of the woman who was stoned to death. She said that it made her realize: \u201cwhy bother to live if you will die on the cross like that!\u201d I love that. That makes me believe in him.\nI believe it has taken me a long time to accept what God is saying to me about the human race. It has taken me a long time to accept what God is telling me about death. It has taken me a long time to realize that death is just one of our human options, as a mother. How many times have been told: \u201cif God wanted us to live forever, he would have done it from the beginning!\u201d It really hasn\u2019t changed the facts of life that I care about. I don\u2019t care about a life where you are reborn, or a life where you are not reborn. How many of you have been told: \u201cthis is a life that God wants you to live,\u201d or \u201cthis is a life that he wanted you to live.\u201d How many of you have been told \u201cif you want to live in heaven, you have to do what he wants you to do.\u201d How many of you want to live a reborn life if the Bible says something else?\nBut I would really like to accept that something, even if I can\u2019t explain why, changes what it means to be human.\nThe more I look at my Bible, the less I want to live, even though there are times when I\u2019m convinced I don\u2019t want to think about that.\nIt isn\u2019t about whether or not you believe it. One of my great loves has always been to read books that make you think, that force you to question things that you have taken for granted. I am a very suspicious person of the things that have been said to me, because something in me has always said \u201ctrust me, I want it to work\u201d. Even though I have been taught that a lot of things I have to trust to happen and I want them to happen because I know, but what are they?","token_len":701,"entropy":[9.2914,2.6044,8.9867,6.956,2.5492,3.135,3.1041,2.5708,2.0081,6.2585,6.49,9.4537,0.9307,4.8223,6.5591,5.8241,3.719,6.6137,3.212,5.5297,6.5091,3.5562,1.4766,4.3055,0.3572,5.0704,4.2118,0.7794,3.6326,1.0265,1.4181,5.1441,0.9487,4.2242,2.9924,4.6869,1.9491,6.9417,1.0023,5.3518,0.4112,3.3292,3.7445,3.5852,0.7089,4.6259,2.2997,0.7044,2.2235,8.2664,1.2775,0.0214,4.9465,3.9965,2.1843,3.0203,0.7588,1.4118,2.8876,0.6635,0.0685,1.0573,2.0327,2.8109,17.3286,7.4685,3.9972,2.4073,5.7257,2.0013,0.0503,0.0036,1.569,4.1229,3.0279,2.4121,1.7079,5.2211,0.1271,0.03,0.8933,1.6751,0.8401,4.8069,1.2871,0.1954,2.2797,0.3622,2.3676,5.5369,3.263,0.6186,0.9809,5.4378,0.5398,1.3205,4.0939,4.6111,0.0963,0.0801,3.8633,2.0039,1.4947,2.9817,5.0655,0.089,1.6894,7.1532,1.4737,3.035,1.2178,2.2805,0.0993,1.5662,6.439,2.6968,3.6891,1.1415,0.0315,0.0454,2.7503,3.4408,5.168,1.6095,0.323,4.6646,3.6641,1.6521,4.3619,4.9429,1.9595,1.8791,2.2709,1.9535,0.6984,0.538,0.1203,1.4196,2.4107,5.4461,3.1905,4.7532,4.3468,3.3779,5.5074,0.2883,2.7398,2.5029,0.9339,0.0305,0.0619,3.1889,0.8944,4.5001,1.4163,0.0454,1.4392,2.0606,4.5211,5.2366,2.8453,4.0284,7.2131,3.943,1.105,2.4322,3.7672,2.9436,2.2463,2.8982,2.2027,1.2553,0.1426,3.5602,1.7862,4.1641,4.4373,4.5682,2.8929,4.5976,0.7742,2.57,4.8705,3.1071,2.5642,2.1922,2.3971,4.9109,1.1068,3.2281,0.0177,3.105,7.2199,3.4653,4.5322,5.1035,2.0673,2.0814,0.7702,0.3951,0.8629,0.5799,0.3824,4.197,4.9059,2.2944,1.9868,0.6647,5.5881,1.1391,0.3773,0.5683,0.2204,0.3806,1.6224,0.7378,1.1474,8.3478,2.6617,7.8655,3.7902,0.8428,0.1325,1.6997,2.6859,1.5876,1.7428,5.0085,1.6414,5.8777,1.1235,2.9498,4.2181,5.9472,2.1212,4.1724,5.3806,0.6499,4.0829,2.5768,3.6957,3.3283,0.9839,3.4652,0.2327,1.986,5.7616,0.5095,3.0582,3.7904,4.7889,0.7832,1.2017,1.6752,6.3518,5.3273,0.0984,13.8969,2.4502,2.2044,1.0919,4.7914,0.6856,1.9311,7.6467,0.0868,0.4756,0.008,1.5584,1.3964,2.1115,2.6802,3.4158,4.9571,0.3146,4.5594,6.3042,5.972,5.9787,6.4592,6.1406,2.8818,4.5319,3.6815,0.6423,5.0299,2.6429,4.223,1.2301,0.0899,7.5109,2.2165,4.4075,1.0258,7.4777,2.5494,4.4584,2.4944,2.2537,3.804,2.7961,0.3834,3.6248,1.1902,3.7176,0.5514,1.5001,1.4869,1.2915,4.4141,4.8492,5.0879,0.7767,1.4154,0.6143,0.0419,0.2532,4.4347,2.9997,3.1973,1.7398,1.0825,3.7169,0.1249,3.9697,2.1667,3.6662,0.2036,0.8429,2.6035,1.208,0.3027,0.1832,0.699,0.1597,0.0511,0.0925,1.7434,1.2508,1.3326,0.6176,2.0981,0.2559,0.3041,7.0933,1.1974,1.1827,0.3709,0.0867,0.0879,0.2439,0.03,0.0073,0.0414,3.3201,0.4619,4.5886,0.6636,3.754,2.1025,1.4515,5.1418,3.4012,5.0114,1.7733,4.0178,3.3511,6.5563,2.2018,5.5278,1.9572,0.7883,0.6152,8.3894,4.0367,4.2536,1.6256,1.2245,4.2491,3.9673,4.0761,2.7674,0.1988,1.8949,3.3836,0.5207,1.8299,0.5744,1.2629,2.944,1.3259,6.7209,0.8856,0.7238,1.9554,0.2674,0.8359,3.1834,5.3313,4.4033,1.9372,0.4479,0.0353,2.8571,3.6677,4.7688,1.7086,1.3669,4.5586,1.0965,4.9707,0.2234,0.6562,1.5811,2.4909,0.45,0.1339,0.009,1.0021,1.2053,4.6187,3.8897,3.6839,2.5653,1.9172,7.2078,2.589,2.0293,2.0021,0.1219,0.2421,0.3557,1.563,4.3621,1.4131,0.7468,4.8852,0.7541,2.9995,1.5013,1.7211,2.1977,1.0116,1.5869,0.8328,0.2402,4.244,0.6819,2.6844,2.66,1.8079,3.5834,1.5209,0.6862,0.042,0.2425,1.893,1.478,0.9046,3.1674,1.7102,0.1268,1.1583,0.1901,0.6619,0.0668,0.4561,3.2363,3.8954,0.2765,0.016,0.484,1.6203,2.2304,0.2535,1.9299,0.0387,0.5087,0.0604,0.1578,0.4838,0.026,4.3604,0.0853,4.2956,1.6664,1.6617,0.2408,1.3632,2.2939,2.4179,1.1689,3.36,1.887,0.0669,3.2192,3.327,1.8385,1.1338,0.1996,0.0358,0.1816,1.0543,2.0029,0.2572,1.2719,0.0201,0.3149,0.0393,6.2182,0.1776,1.3638,3.5041,13.2583,0.296,4.6409,4.0923,2.3006,0.9063,5.2223,5.4093,2.472,1.7612,3.7524,1.3163,4.7293,4.3844,0.4496,0.2656,5.6952,1.3086,5.5069,4.1867,2.6109,0.2819,2.1492,2.6137,0.2139,0.0216,0.0078,0.4239,1.0887,0.8362,8.8338,3.2641,3.3655,0.7792,0.6937,0.967,0.3653,0.4027,2.24,3.4902,5.2495,0.6095,3.6459,0.4713,3.6052,3.6352,0.4428,0.2044,3.0984,0.4362,3.0759,0.1452,5.0338,3.472,3.6178,1.6912,3.386,0.6476,4.9753,0.5075,0.363,6.5375,0.1135,0.8456,5.1563,2.5927,3.1368,0.4005,0.0601,0.0355,2.0053,0.129,6.4929,0.4931,3.0957,0.5887,1.8191,3.5992,4.497,1.17,0.1217,0.0009,2.5861,3.7212,1.239,0.0035,2.8041,2.6292,2.7796,0.9749,7.6613,1.2443,2.1595,4.835,4.2292,3.6088,1.2081,0.0203,1.6906,1.2897,4.0639,2.0979,3.6735,3.043,1.4879,2.4782,3.5269,7.6924,0.9158,0.2311,4.4256,2.7648,1.8675,0.7778,2.7858,6.4753,0.1141,0.0012,0.5925,1.589,3.8433,2.2014,3.4396,8.6409,0.4107,5.7275,2.6598,4.5345,0.7159,3.2991,1.4095,2.5231,2.4828,0.0381,1.573,2.8059,7.0168,3.6207,3.1475,1.6179,1.3472,3.3312,5.0007,0.4788,8.7532,0.6324,0.8017,1.685,4.1627,4.3677,0.6499,3.4989,3.6536,6.7736,4.7991,5.5908,1.21,0.4672,1.9979,2.53,2.431,1.0377,4.5428,1.2965,0.1428,0.9926,3.0613,1.0825,5.7634,4.6414,2.3604,6.0329,4.1889,2.5098,2.3432,2.5015,0.1617,0.6893,4.9989,0.8037,3.5186,4.6463,5.1214,3.7508,4.5378,1.3734,1.3879]}

This is what you have to say .","text":"Your wife is a witch. After years the relationship is breaking apart until divorce is brought up. In the following argument, while telling her everything you ever hated about her, she uses a spell that allows you only to speak in poems. This is what you have to say. Tell her that since you can't remember anything about her it means you don't need her and that she cannot have any of the things you love in you, just the opposite. Tell her that she has to leave you alone or else she will bring you back.\nWhat you want to say is that you can't have anything meaningful or even interesting going on in the past, now or later. Just a monotonous affair that has no soul. If one were to say it would sound a bit like the first two sentences. However, I couldn't see anything wrong with it.\nI'm not sure if it's a true story, but I think it makes perfect sense to me :)\nWhat to say to a witch?\nI know it makes more sense to kill witches nowadays, but even if I did, I still wouldn't be able to answer this question because I can't remember what is wrong with your situation. But I do see this as something that you and your girlfriend should talk about. If it was up to me, I would try to calm your girlfriend and reassure her. Maybe even tell her that she isn't responsible for what has happened, but it is your words that harm you even more. In the end what your girlfriend did was wrong no matter what, so you might want to just let it go.\nIf you are her boyfriend, I think your girlfriend does deserve some praise because she did the right thing. Not in the end it will be very hard, maybe even impossible, to forgive someone for a misplaced word. You say it was a bad word, but she knows it's not.\nIn the end: It's your problem. But you have to be aware of the consequences of what you say, which could have tragic consequences. If you are the guy in this situation, then you have to be open about what you want and get it.\nI remember how I was in that same situation many years ago. You just have to be aware of your words and understand why you hurt your girlfriend in the first place, and then let her know why that means she should leave you alone. She is suffering already enough. Perhaps if she knew this she'd be able to get over your past and give another chance.\nTo your girlfriend I can't say more than this: it's always up to her. I'm pretty sure in her case she just wanted to take away from herself what you were feeling, because otherwise it might have been too painful for her also. You are still together even though the relationship is falling apart because of your words, and in the end she just decided to leave you alone because you were so abusive when she tried to explain what happened.\nThe last sentence to your girlfriend is quite obvious: You can't have everything to do with the past, but also the present and the future. You have to live in the here and now and be happy together with her. What matters most is that you can live with it, and that she can let go of the past. After all it was her decision after all and she does deserve peace after that.\nIt's really the only way to find out what to say to a

{"prompt":"Your cat wo n't stop meowing at you . After an hour you 've had enough .

You yell to the cat that you will do anything they ask if they say it in English. `` Deal '' responds the cat. You get on the phone with the vet and ask who you need to see at the Veterinary Emergency Clinic. The animal hospital answers and says \u0093They need a service vehicle. Where is the nearest one to your location?\u0094 You call the emergency vet you are looking to see. The telephone line rings and someone answers and says \u0093What do you need?\u0094 The vet asks if I can speak to the other vet. The phone rings \u0093I have to get the hospital to send me a service vehicle, please can you repeat the first question?\u0094\nWhat a waste of time. I would rather pay the fee and say to the people who took the call \u0093I am sorry. Here's the address to the place you've got to go.\u0094\nAs far as we are concerned, we are in a recession, not a war. The military and other government departments are being cut. The same applies to private companies. The last thing we are doing is paying for the training and education of more and more military and naval personnel. A few hundred hundred thousand and that's it. It is like opening the tap once in the day. The tap would take a good half hour to empty. That is all. With the exception of those who are going into action and the elderly, who are being watched carefully, there is no need to take out our frustration with them on people who are trying to carry out their duties.\nIt is not fair for us to cut back on our training funds and allow the military to starve to death. They need more funds. We need to stop talking about what goes on in the military and navy and start talking about the people who do not have a great deal of money to spend. We all need to stop taking the side against the government because of the recession and start supporting the government that is there to work for us, not against us.\nWe have seen in the past why government is not to be trusted. There are people in the government that can do what they wish with our money, and they will not stop at anything to get it. There are two sides to our government, both of which do not deserve our confidence.\nI don't think there is an American that does not pay taxes. What you might not know is that those government departments that take your money are the ones being cut back. The government tries to get money by borrowing from the people and those people can't afford it. The banks and corporations have been the ones to get the money the government needs and so, they, and the corporations and banks, are not being cut back. If we are going to cut back and have a recession, why should they be allowed to continue their activities and keep making money, while trying to get government help?\nThe next time you hear someone say \u0093The government is in the military.

{"prompt":"Through the static , I saw what they called `` Rain ''","text":"Through the static, I saw what they called `` Rain '' it was cloud like material, rain like drops falling from the cloud. '' I asked her '' did that happen before?.... She said she has been reading these readings for years.\nJust as the energy and time frame of these things are known not many know of the details of the time frame.\nI remember having seen in the past this type of material as well, but only when I was at home. Once I was out and I saw a dark cloud like area in the middle of the night sky with many light dots falling from it. I looked out of window and realized it was the moon. It was a great sight.\nI saw in dreams a giant light up light up sky full with white light and a light like white light that shot through the sky.\nI am beginning to see these things more frequently, and also I am reading more books about UFO\u00b4s. Like, one I read called '' We Know There Are Alien Lifeforms in the Universe''. It was by Kenneth F. Kearns.\n'' I asked the person with whom I was staying ( a friend of mine ) once, what exactly was this book all about, '' what do you mean, what about? he asked '' What do you mean, it's all about, he said.. I said, well, I am not sure, but he said it was all about this question- what do you think? How do you think, did you find something out, he asked, '' what about? What do you mean what about? I am still a little puzzled as to what he meant by it. I don't see anything in there about UFOs or extraterrestrial beings or whatever, so, I figured maybe he meant the same thing, what, what have you found out?''\nI had read this book many moons ago or years ago. Its called '' We know they Exist - UFOs, Aliens Extranormal Life on Other Earth '' by William C. Oates. Its in the genre of '' Explanations '' not theories.\nThe author discusses the possibility that '' There may be intelligent life in space other than on earth ''.. so the book has, in large part, about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. It is not meant to be a book on the subject, and although it has a number of facts, it is not a scientific work. Its intended for lay people to read at their own level.\nI didn't read it back then and its been years! I remember a friend telling me about it. I have a copy since and can vouch for its truthfulness.\ni remember reading that one when i was about 5 years old.. and i read it again a month ago or so.. there were some sections in the book that told the story in terms of an 'ancestor' (a human being a lot older than ourselves) who knew about the possibilities, and that we will eventually move out of the galaxy to a place very far away from earth and that we will have time to prepare for that. i remember thinking that there was a little bit of hope there. but i agree it was a good book..\nI remember the one also. My Dad bought it for me but I didn't much care for it at the time, now it is one that I keep on my shelf for curiosity sake. Perhaps in the future, when I am not so young...or perhaps never.","token_len":703,"entropy":[2.5115,10.8064,3.801,3.9486,4.4813,4.4521,4.1314,2.5216,8.4398,16.2115,7.3767,7.4103,1.1603,7.979,4.7853,7.1039,2.087,5.7925,2.7174,6.7724,3.6874,1.5879,0.6315,5.6351,1.1297,6.6799,3.1408,4.3999,4.5072,6.0677,5.1649,3.3258,2.8934,5.3611,2.2056,8.976,3.7875,0.7397,3.9039,4.9656,3.4618,5.8168,5.556,6.2052,1.8541,2.2833,1.312,3.9069,9.7541,2.2963,2.3519,7.3455,4.4014,3.8987,6.0926,1.4177,3.8294,5.0865,2.1953,5.1902,6.5366,7.3025,5.633,3.5266,2.1666,5.3244,0.5033,1.1753,6.0503,1.3941,2.0536,2.2323,2.4497,4.7604,4.2581,4.8675,4.9171,1.7018,2.2638,3.9317,5.243,0.0316,4.8168,4.3581,2.4957,2.0278,2.6979,3.8485,3.4181,0.8465,1.0097,3.5343,3.1277,1.0093,6.2833,0.9866,2.0417,4.0101,2.685,4.7157,1.4972,2.6319,6.3154,1.6368,3.639,6.6233,3.0596,0.559,2.8058,0.1566,0.3594,1.9519,4.9496,3.8219,5.127,3.9371,4.3543,4.2902,1.3721,0.8822,0.4321,1.6126,3.6132,3.3348,2.4307,5.8126,0.6915,4.5515,2.2195,0.229,2.5382,4.5356,0.9608,2.4997,0.6387,2.3059,4.2841,3.7951,0.9691,1.196,1.4808,3.2368,3.9532,7.5431,3.5005,5.4778,3.8814,5.8702,4.2504,3.0955,4.2531,6.251,6.2601,4.3666,1.6264,2.6176,2.7099,3.5263,2.925,3.118,1.241,2.8758,5.9897,2.098,0.712,2.0051,0.9573,2.0273,1.1335,5.2648,6.5526,0.0421,1.9989,3.5894,1.7186,4.0727,4.326,2.6664,1.7169,4.8285,3.0725,1.5287,5.7414,1.0845,3.8272,1.5398,6.8869,7.5215,0.0218,0.95,6.7778,4.0146,4.9936,5.978,1.4182,5.3315,2.2629,7.2072,4.7897,3.7933,3.4792,4.5113,2.748,2.9616,1.6179,0.6049,1.6198,7.6402,2.2776,1.38,5.2908,6.7399,4.7189,0.7902,8.0284,0.7544,2.6098,1.3991,5.6041,3.2978,4.8853,3.4069,4.1457,4.4935,2.753,0.1955,1.3051,4.8804,5.9411,6.7553,2.1819,0.7134,0.3185,1.5114,7.0453,2.5807,2.5817,5.2741,1.2084,3.0139,5.5111,5.9272,0.0069,2.0865,4.5272,5.3816,2.9501,0.539,1.3621,2.5175,2.2735,4.1963,4.9151,6.3158,1.0844,6.9429,3.3474,1.8218,0.0711,0.0691,1.1745,4.4462,1.6979,2.6054,0.2974,4.8781,4.2431,1.094,6.5338,3.1288,2.4665,1.3937,3.3277,1.1471,1.7583,3.8261,2.3948,1.0723,1.6839,1.1895,4.1016,0.4755,2.1876,1.1986,2.4108,0.1084,4.2113,6.9688,6.3543,2.3738,1.3914,0.0619,4.341,1.9497,6.0479,1.2173,0.112,1.2096,3.5471,4.0737,0.7753,3.8989,4.0057,1.926,3.1206,3.9755,0.9416,2.7081,2.8523,3.2924,2.5824,1.7555,4.0724,1.413,0.0142,1.0545,4.3182,1.3839,0.6446,2.4751,3.5468,4.8287,4.1879,0.77,2.7592,2.5758,0.1543,0.7812,2.7782,1.3216,1.4405,2.3073,1.3517,1.6041,2.9655,0.0128,5.1026,2.6005,2.5534,3.3954,2.7999,3.2276,2.544,3.4382,1.0216,2.9439,3.092,2.7729,1.8374,2.8392,4.2185,1.2405,6.1618,3.5535,2.1694,1.7378,3.3624,2.5557,0.1575,2.524,4.2572,5.6331,2.316,5.6104,0.2148,3.3282,0.6443,1.6935,1.5517,0.7932,1.2702,3.4659,2.2425,2.9554,0.2941,3.3629,7.328,0.1064,6.0397,4.2155,0.1003,1.7052,6.0457,3.8673,1.276,3.5766,5.0638,6.6776,9.135,0.7625,4.0487,4.184,2.1761,3.1554,11.2109,5.6906,0.8166,3.9343,7.2607,7.279,1.6576,8.2111,2.5127,4.2726,3.65,0.1457,4.9904,4.0387,0.727,3.15,5.3076,1.3176,9.088,0.6038,2.2795,10.4361,1.0944,4.6817,7.3776,9.2554,1.6187,1.4516,2.9915,2.9127,6.6843,1.6267,3.8568,1.1166,5.2843,4.3025,2.5538,0.2237,4.2466,0.5733,1.9023,3.9514,5.943,0.1013,5.1559,1.8515,7.1673,6.3012,4.9773,3.1667,3.0421,3.4186,6.2296,2.2918,6.6978,0.1368,0.056,5.4192,1.8987,2.6103,0.737,1.5941,0.0939,0.2139,0.7478,3.0072,1.4574,2.7086,6.171,0.3915,0.9351,0.9741,3.7064,2.3242,2.3897,1.9552,1.6519,3.3531,5.3916,1.469,2.3061,2.1461,3.5202,0.0155,4.7727,1.7565,1.2743,0.7895,0.8678,1.5372,2.7261,3.7694,0.6808,2.6201,4.3087,5.2196,5.1227,1.6933,1.5332,0.8742,4.6859,1.6847,2.3053,5.4755,1.1609,0.8875,1.8727,5.9846,0.1002,2.3497,1.8366,5.9306,1.2749,2.9473,5.1785,3.2097,5.2567,6.259,1.4953,4.425,4.188,2.4333,3.2756,0.0616,1.8697,1.2324,2.0605,1.6406,3.5445,3.3969,2.4983,7.6173,2.9342,4.3045,7.389,0.0231,0.2361,1.2635,4.8289,2.1884,0.2986,1.1945,8.436,3.6499,1.2396,3.6573,3.2541,5.1051,1.3634,0.3573,3.3758,2.991,0.5818,0.0443,5.4489,2.5561,1.8761,3.3876,0.9652,2.7004,3.7533,4.166,3.1864,5.5543,0.1983,2.1048,5.6618,2.0178,2.3861,7.1694,2.5117,1.7057,0.344,1.2516,5.6482,2.1906,0.5811,5.3078,4.9899,0.0537,4.9337,5.0468,8.8047,0.0751,0.8029,1.0204,3.6478,2.3591,4.2602,0.4088,7.373,4.5655,4.5329,0.2168,5.1719,1.0094,2.6053,6.2304,1.8814,1.7019,7.0515,3.0862,1.684,3.6178,4.0923,5.51,3.7247,7.3995,3.6748,0.5224,1.1341,3.9921,2.3575,2.731,2.0904,6.2113,1.8091,0.4111,0.806,3.5674,2.0634,3.5878,1.5217,0.535,2.4745,6.2144,0.3834,5.3373,0.8804,2.8852,1.1504,2.6294,2.4213,2.9196,1.7781,3.3407,1.3683,1.4177,4.3851,1.8975,0.3117,4.9029,3.4288,2.0316,3.0886,2.1907,8.1555,3.7167,1.092,1.4433,3.4591,0.9146,2.9813,2.1213,2.2922,2.9167,3.2207,4.78,8.0484,4.3917,6.1315,6.0216,4.6876,0.4278,1.5939,0.5733,4.9217,2.2212,2.0983,0.0249,7.17,0.9616,1.1233,0.1862,1.4457,1.0915,0.0111,2.0294,6.0943,2.6596,0.8777,3.9687,4.7948,1.1189,4.093,3.1863,0.5737,0.3332,2.1286,8.7284,4.8304,0.4651,7.2626,3.958,0.7123,0.2228,2.0378,2.6705,1.2105,1.4995,3.9836,3.0244,5.3388,4.7934,7.1219,2.7839,6.3105,2.0781]}

{"prompt":"Everyone on earth with an IQ lower than 100 disappear immediately .","text":"Everyone on earth with an IQ lower than 100 disappear immediately. The only ones left are the people between 100 and 150. The one up to 150 try to hide,but eventually they are all eliminated.\nThere is still people between 150 and 200, but they are no wiser that before.And they continue to hide.\nAnd so on, down to 150, down to 150, down to 100. And nothing left to hide anymore.\nThen in the end, there are those who were on level 0 IQ and started off in the bottom of the pyramid and got lucky and reached a top position in the pyramid.\nThey are not intelligent as they all started from the bottom.But they have an advantage of the top positions as other things are not important as before.\nSo all the people were eliminated without knowing that they were getting eliminated when they could have avoided it by knowing the rules, and by not joining the pyramid in the first place.\nSo this time it\u2019s all about not having a top position in the pyramid. I know that all the people will be dismayed by this conclusion. But this is what I found.\nThis was a true pyramid scheme.The original top position was never more than 15% of the total number of people.\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out how a pyramid scheme can work.\nYou should look at every pyramid scheme as a series of deals.\nThose who are on the top are getting paid what they sell to the new entrants to the pyramid.\nThey also provide you the opportunity for new entrants to get a top position, in exchange to the new entrants money they collected from everyone who arrived at the top.\nThis is only for those who want it.\nYou can choose to come or stay\nIf you do not find it to be profitable and you can\u2019t understand it. You can just leave it like that.\nThere are more top positions than entrants to fill the first ones.\nSo the main problem with the pyramid scheme is that you could never earn enough money to leave it.\nEven the few who earn enough for that,are not at the top because the rules are such that the top is 15 persons.\nPeople get discouraged because the top position does not even bring them enough money to leave.\nThey go on getting paid until the new ones get paid and then it\u2019s all been said.\nThe same deal happens everywhere in the pyramid scheme. So how does it work?\nThose who are at the top in the pyramid scheme are those who have sold as many items as possible,before they are sold by the next ones who came from the previous top.They have already sold a lot of their items.So the top people are the most desperate people in the pyramid scheme. When they see that the top people are also getting paid,they see no reason to stay with the pyramid scheme.\nNow they may be able even to earn more by joining the top position in the following pyramid scheme. But they have to sell more items to get paid. Or they will lose more items to the next ones at the top.\nIf they sell less they won\u2019t reach the top position where the 15 persons are getting paid.\nSo as you can see there are no benefits for the top persons from staying in their roles in the pyramid scheme.\nThe best is to make as many deals as possible as early as possible to sell as much as you

{"prompt":"Your fortune cookie says `` 404 : Future not found '' . After you read it , everything around you stops .","text":"Your fortune cookie says `` 404 : Future not found ''. After you read it, everything around you stops. You realize you\u0092re trapped in time. You\u0092re stuck in an infinite loop. You\u0092re stuck waiting. You\u0092re stuck not knowing. Time seems to have never passed. Your mind has now forgotten all the details but not everything. You\u0092ve tried. You failed. You\u0092re stuck in the present. You\u0092re stuck in the future. You\u0092re stuck here. What\u0092s your future cookie saying?\nYou\u0092ve spent the last twenty years, at this time of night thinking about everything and nobody. Staring at the ceiling in fear of all the possibilities. All the things you want to do. All the things you would have. All the things that have been taken out of your life. You can\u0092t move forward. You can\u0092t do anything. You\u0092re waiting for the day you\u0092ll wake up and the whole thing will vanish.\nMaybe that day hasn\u0092t come. Maybe none of us know the future. Maybe it\u0092s a loop and we\u0092re stuck here forever. Maybe we\u0092re all going to die tomorrow. Maybe your life\u0092s a shitty waste of effort and time. Maybe it\u0092s hard to imagine when I\u0092m telling you that your life\u0092s only a cookie that\u0092s about to be eaten by an unknowing asshole. Maybe you\u0092ll find out in the morning that those cookies all have something inside of them : time. Maybe that\u0092s what the cookies are saying. They\u0092re telling you that your life\u0092s a fuck up. Your life\u0092s a shitty waste of time. You\u0092re not wasting your life. You\u0092re living it.\nMaybe the future is already written. Maybe you\u0092re all in our minds. Maybe the future is the past of everything that was. All the things that\u0092ve happened. All the things that\u0092ll happen. Maybe it\u0092s just a shitty movie that we\u0092re stuck in the middle of. The middle of the fucked up timeline. Maybe we\u0092re all in a fucking video game on a fucking screen. Maybe it\u0092s just the beginning. Maybe what you\u0092re hearing right now is something that we all have been experiencing. Maybe we all have forgotten what it was like to feel alive. Everything and everybody just disappeared like a bad dream.\nMaybe you\u0092re the asshole here because you wanted to come back to the moment before you fell asleep. Maybe you\u0092re just a fucked up asshole looking for something that you\u0092re already missing. Maybe you\u0092re looking for something that you never possessed in the first place. Maybe you\u0092re the asshole who\u0092re trying to forget. Maybe we\u0092re the asshole who\u0092re living in the present. We\u0092ve lost it all. We\u0092ve lost the past. We\u0092ve lost the future. We just go from one fucked up part of our life to the next. We\u0092ll wake up next week and realize that life hasn\u0092t changed. Everything is the very same.

{"prompt":"Cthulhu awakens and takes over the world . However , he disappoints his constituency when he does n't deliver the mass insanity and chaos that he promised .","text":"Cthulhu awakens and takes over the world. However, he disappoints his constituency when he doesn't deliver the mass insanity and chaos that he promised. Instead his action proves to be somewhat benign and instead of giving us a horror movie that will make you scream, he ends up just making you worry a bit more about what could be on the way. He takes a long hard look at the current world and the people and how the masses behave and react and then goes down on almost a par with a good mystery novel to solve the mystery.\nThe problem with this movie is that it doesn't make you care about what might be on the way, in fact it doesn 't make you care about what is going on right now. It tells us how we should respond to things instead of making us care that, for good or for bad, that is what our governments are doing. I think this movie is a bit ahead of its time and I am not sure if this is an attempt to make us think and realize how we are going to be impacted by a global scare or if it really is a work of art, a movie that tries to show other things than just evil plots and the like.\nThere is a lot I want to say about this movie but for now I am content to just say that I really like it, a film that I would rate 8 out of 10. I think the writing, the acting, the production are all first class and to just see a director of this caliber in charge of making such a good movie is a bit of a turn on.\nIt seems like a bit strange that the movie comes out on DVD but there might be a good reason why. I have gotten to see movies I wouldn't normally have gotten a chance to see and this was certainly one of those films. If ever there was a crime that should be solved all the way to the bottom it is the crime of torture and we get to see it all the way to the bitter end.\nThere are many different plots and twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the very end but I enjoyed it very much. The main cast does a great job with their respective roles and I enjoy watching a series like The Tudors where there are a lot of people coming and going at different times throughout the series so I am very surprised when it comes to someone.\nThe main reason I watch political thrillers like these is to watch politicians react to situations such as these and I think that is something worth watching. There are a lot of little stuff going on in this movie and I can't wait to see what will happen. This definitely has to be one of the best series that I have ever seen.\nOne of the reasons why I really enjoy the TV series is because it gives us a chance to see what happens during the trial. One can never tell in these things what might happen so it's always good to see what it might be all about. For me, the most interesting things I have seen so far is how the media would react when things go public and how they would use those stories later.\nI think this is a great series and I hope that it will continue. The story lines are not always that interesting, most of the times you will not know what it is that is going to happen next but it is still compelling and I enjoy it. You have to see this if you have not yet, it is definitely one of the best TV shows of all time.","token_len":707,"entropy":[7.372,1.1929,10.2059,0.0509,2.4565,3.9767,1.9383,0.6389,1.0666,0.8477,4.6173,0.1743,1.6901,11.441,0.0626,1.7695,12.6758,3.6365,0.4971,4.3546,0.001,5.3274,2.2205,7.8977,7.5177,3.2945,4.0936,1.2955,1.5426,1.5965,1.0923,4.4936,5.4327,8.2129,4.872,0.9317,0.0542,6.1516,7.5374,1.5408,6.0675,0.6477,4.5003,3.7464,1.5055,7.0079,1.5166,2.6025,3.0446,2.8327,1.5612,3.6161,1.447,1.9066,4.3836,0.2122,4.964,2.7038,0.8064,6.2535,4.0611,1.3429,0.7968,1.0897,2.2474,4.8758,2.1359,4.4511,0.8101,3.2027,0.4847,3.4521,5.2503,2.6929,4.8696,3.0612,0.1602,0.1129,1.0227,5.1606,2.5269,0.6883,3.2608,3.8904,3.4762,4.8431,2.9697,5.9491,5.701,1.5744,7.291,2.9942,2.6376,3.4602,4.695,1.2874,8.68,3.6283,4.5561,0.0768,3.1933,5.253,8.4832,2.4899,4.9141,6.501,1.3032,0.5763,0.7431,2.1232,5.258,4.4402,0.8875,1.0996,2.7796,0.2257,0.358,0.7678,2.6443,0.0007,3.506,1.4737,3.2035,0.9191,2.0166,3.6116,0.9308,1.148,0.1042,0.3551,2.1671,5.3495,0.5849,0.7754,3.7029,11.8568,3.9046,1.3935,0.168,0.5772,1.3043,1.4254,2.647,1.78,0.5733,5.2447,0.133,1.0969,1.5488,5.9221,2.7377,3.3183,2.9313,3.0869,4.514,0.4451,2.814,5.1644,0.3971,3.9222,1.0452,2.3564,4.0039,5.7693,3.0683,5.6584,0.151,2.3264,1.3055,0.2351,4.0007,2.1163,1.7357,3.9124,6.1361,1.2532,1.2759,0.8442,3.4712,2.3746,1.6046,1.1669,1.1097,1.6652,3.2205,7.582,0.0326,0.1435,0.007,2.0585,1.5583,3.3556,1.7349,1.2087,1.5863,2.3996,0.8686,3.3746,3.4117,0.3258,2.1174,1.4272,3.668,4.1794,6.2696,2.7835,1.8916,2.1489,2.319,0.0218,3.2366,5.0565,0.5136,3.525,4.909,8.6296,2.0071,1.5173,0.8713,3.4797,0.4736,1.5083,6.4282,0.6337,1.4141,2.8478,2.9577,4.2836,0.9065,4.2224,0.0697,4.0075,7.5016,3.6533,4.5368,2.6397,7.3172,9.0681,1.5022,3.6608,3.6071,0.3645,1.3658,3.9831,1.1883,1.2246,1.368,4.2852,2.07,0.0296,0.733,0.5347,0.9609,0.3569,2.2061,3.466,1.7238,0.7774,1.9764,6.8172,0.9738,1.3643,1.8611,0.5614,1.2627,3.2347,1.9098,1.3064,2.7356,5.063,3.0847,0.2758,2.391,3.1711,6.7285,5.7062,1.6166,0.0025,0.0745,1.0665,1.6922,2.1746,2.3347,4.7493,2.4887,1.0884,2.2183,0.3544,0.2057,4.4876,4.1676,0.9992,8.2161,1.7339,1.175,5.9522,5.6875,5.1461,2.3841,5.5817,4.5176,0.8129,0.3666,3.6458,5.5537,0.3408,2.4922,2.5973,0.4901,2.7382,0.7072,0.813,1.7542,4.1548,1.5782,0.3996,6.2258,3.618,1.0297,2.1977,3.7279,3.9332,0.7571,1.8918,4.2191,5.9491,1.0086,2.2555,2.7757,5.41,1.1031,2.5263,3.5508,3.1268,3.9457,5.674,0.3087,1.2616,3.9291,0.7423,1.1678,1.8284,1.7443,2.2896,6.6588,2.2819,1.239,5.3906,3.2014,5.01,0.002,1.5352,2.1095,3.7813,3.6309,0.2971,0.0208,0.5289,2.2127,2.3474,3.2722,4.653,1.2807,0.2356,1.276,2.7335,0.7396,3.9422,6.9656,0.6092,0.2052,0.3858,8.59,3.9242,4.4211,1.2989,4.2927,6.1242,2.7893,1.5659,1.8081,0.3647,3.8374,2.3843,1.1196,2.8766,4.1074,0.7188,6.8211,1.701,5.3984,3.1681,0.9484,0.2605,1.5533,3.3775,2.2697,0.2725,0.7387,0.1467,8.6344,0.0158,0.4989,1.4606,3.4054,1.0909,2.5397,4.1403,5.0578,1.2866,4.7016,1.6926,3.5061,1.7639,6.5679,2.1455,4.5653,4.9754,0.5762,0.8386,1.3272,0.034,3.2123,0.4226,2.4064,1.9945,6.0573,2.6494,4.354,0.0128,0.5926,1.7851,3.6728,4.491,4.504,0.675,0.8695,0.0035,2.0985,2.019,5.0177,0.67,0.6651,1.6777,5.6656,1.6598,3.1238,5.4916,5.2051,3.362,6.5637,0.1868,3.3754,3.0667,0.8148,2.313,0.4933,0.0475,4.457,4.8694,3.5048,0.5186,3.3199,2.6446,0.7216,4.1327,0.1124,2.686,4.0351,1.5851,2.5571,2.1552,4.4576,3.3294,2.8917,1.7854,0.2271,6.9661,5.5513,1.1276,1.8453,3.653,4.1944,0.8537,5.513,11.267,5.1584,0.0003,2.1236,3.5062,0.5443,2.4939,2.8315,5.5743,5.8121,0.6562,4.182,5.7616,0.0047,3.3304,1.4157,1.7473,2.0687,1.5419,0.9619,2.4934,5.9512,1.6723,0.6166,3.4471,0.7366,1.5621,0.3263,0.0281,6.897,7.2331,3.0239,0.0432,1.3995,1.7516,0.6254,1.7683,1.3243,3.6247,0.8233,0.7888,0.2654,0.3812,0.9342,4.2779,0.4885,1.9909,4.0248,7.2097,2.7022,1.5742,0.1944,0.6509,0.0849,0.4912,1.0156,6.2655,3.0347,0.3197,0.122,1.0819,0.3118,1.0257,0.8973,4.5493,1.4393,0.2779,3.4754,1.9798,0.287,3.9239,2.8021,2.3699,5.2621,0.5428,0.4506,0.9696,1.1384,3.1528,1.4773,0.8368,1.9928,0.0602,1.0935,2.4471,2.9487,4.3975,1.0715,6.0704,2.891,4.5511,4.992,3.4158,3.1468,5.0494,4.199,4.2941,3.2145,3.7515,0.5764,4.742,1.8116,3.1999,2.936,2.8183,0.1502,0.7379,1.3633,4.6888,3.1302,1.5643,5.3417,0.4432,0.4819,4.903,1.5692,1.1738,1.8965,2.7665,2.0443,4.4243,2.8592,1.5809,0.3131,2.539,0.0005,3.0242,2.8207,1.268,5.9528,6.0603,0.6788,2.5352,4.2264,2.0872,6.2064,1.3918,1.246,1.9578,1.012,5.9045,4.2361,3.5518,8.7914,1.9913,1.47,1.6929,2.276,1.8135,1.0982,1.4155,1.7117,1.7021,1.4589,1.0202,2.6021,1.0585,1.6747,1.5198,1.9942,4.1494,2.837,4.0575,6.3644,1.1711,4.4427,3.606,4.1407,2.4814,2.5957,6.0772,0.4668,0.3955,3.374,2.9449,1.9098,3.9381,2.8955,0.7978,4.225,0.4514,2.8373,1.3359,0.3359,1.4412,0.2394,3.8642,1.8528,2.2684,1.1405,3.2426,6.3857,1.5793,1.5196,4.8368,3.0679,0.9591,4.8695,2.7701,0.3197,3.0756,2.1706,5.7292,0.0311,2.9399,2.0542,3.3997,3.8901,2.5062,0.6924,3.4065,1.6588,0.1412,0.5532,0.3367,2.1901,0.7541,1.9075,0.9453,0.0159,0.3581]}
{"prompt":"Scare me ... with an Easter bunny .","text":"Scare me... with an Easter bunny. I will never get over it.\nSo many years ago, an old woman had to visit her lawyer. They'd planned to meet in a small downtown courthouse, but when they got there, he had closed the doors. She was a little skeptical, but her friend insisted that this lawyer was her most trusted friend in the city, and so she decided to give it a try.\nThe old woman walked into the courthouse and looked up at the arched doors. The man was standing there, staring down at her intently. \"What in the world?\" she said. \"You're not just going to let me stand there like this?\"\n\"Yes, miss,\" the man said, \"I am that,\" and threw open the doors. The old woman was shocked. She walked in and sat down. For a moment, she felt a chill run down her spine. She quickly felt herself forget everything about the lawyer, and instead remembering the old home where she grew up in a lowly part of town, where someone once said she should \"wait until you had a little bit deeper pocket'cause then you'd get a lawyer.\"\nThe old woman had never been very fond of lawyers, but her friend convinced her to go, so she took the seat at the back of the courtroom. The lawyer spoke in a calm tone: \"My dear friend, you have just arrived from an unhappy past. I am here as a friend of yours and I wish to help you get to a happier one.\"\nAfter a few moments of silence, the lawyer spoke again. \"My dear friend, I can assure you that no living person in this city has ever had a better life than you have, and I know how difficult your path this day will be, and it is only for the best. My dear friend, you will have to give up many of your privileges in order to attain true happiness. You may not be able to marry a lover you truly love until you've given it all up for him. You may not even drive around in your car or buy clothes that you simply love until you've paid your debt. You may never go out to a theater or a movie or a restaurant with friends until you've paid for them. My dear friend, the time is not far away when you will have to leave this earth, and until that time you will have to live without many rights we feel absolutely certain that you would never want to give up.\"\nThe old woman sat back down. Her eyes began to wander around the courtroom. Suddenly she thought of something she'd never thought she'd want: to have a lawyer as her last friend.\nOne day, the lady of leisure, the one always reading and drinking the wine and getting ready for her long winter afternoon's rest, heard somebody out in the yard. She thought she could go out and play and the door was slightly ajar.\nShe got out and saw a huge man dressed all in black, with black hair, and the man looked up at her.

{"prompt":"Humanity has long forgotten their origins and purpose . Now , many centuries later , our creators have returned .","text":"Humanity has long forgotten their origins and purpose. Now, many centuries later, our creators have returned. The prophetic writings of Moses and others have been fulfilled. We are being invited to the promised land.\nOn May 5th, 2003, the Lord put me in a tremendous prophetic dream while still in Egypt. I could scarcely open my eyes and I know it is just a vision. I kept praying asking the Lord for his help. Suddenly it turned into a very strong prophecy. I don\u2019t want to go into details, I will spare you. However, the following day I was awakened and I could not close my eyes again. At first I thought I was losing my mind, but the Lord explained everything to me. There was one point that stood out which the Lord explained to me:\n\u201cHe who sings the Lord\u2019s song shall rise up. Whoever prays to my name shall be saved. The Lord is my God; I will exalt him the day of my calamity\u201d.\nMy heart throbbed with emotion as I read the prophecy. I kept imagining things like how difficult it is for every believer to stand up in the day of my trouble or calamity.\nEvery believers\u2019 heart is as light as the sun in the days of the Lord, but in days of trouble the sun starts shining slowly. What my heart felt was that our Lord\u2019s name is more glorified in the days of our tribulation. The fact is that he can bring us through the difficult days with his strong arm and will lead us to a better future. We need to stay in him and have faith that he is with us and we are never alone. Just as he tells us in Psalm 27:1-2:\n\u201cMy strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I delight in\u8f6f\u5f31. The heart of the brave is a fountain of life.\u201d\nThe strength that is perfect in weakness leads you to a better future. The Bible says that it is better to have weakness and live with the Lord than to have plenty of strength and live for yourself (James 1:2-4). The weakness that brings you close to God is a precious thing, a strength that surpasses all others. I cannot say for sure what my future will be like with or without the Lord, but I can say with a 100% confidence that it will be better.\nAs you may have noticed, it is also hard for someone to believe that there is a new covenant in the age of the internet. What we believe is that it is easy to see in the bible new covenants from Moses, David, Ezra, Nehemiah and many others to the present, since they were written in the time of Christ and we have seen that the Lord never changed his ways and it shows that things are not like what humans think today. We are not going to come and start a new covenant from scratch; we don\u2019t see any reason to start a new covenant when a new one has existed for 2000 years. What we see are different, simpler and more understandable times. It isn\u2019t a new covenant, but it is called \u201cNew Covenant of Grace\u201d, because it is different with one thing: \u201cGrace\u201d. Today I want to use the \u201cnew\u201d language to better explain what the difference is between the old covenant in the law and the new covenant of grace.","token_len":708,"entropy":[7.4121,3.3745,3.9809,8.3123,5.2334,3.7135,2.0029,7.4161,1.1016,4.7431,1.0759,4.5891,4.3875,0.6749,0.0575,4.2831,7.7351,1.52,4.1591,2.7472,2.5931,10.628,5.4335,0.2012,4.814,1.5957,5.0427,2.2449,2.7656,4.8614,0.8536,2.7616,1.7486,5.0335,6.1974,0.3326,3.6184,6.3496,0.0644,2.0769,1.6944,10.9813,3.1284,3.1411,1.6573,0.2963,6.3879,0.2196,1.4496,4.995,7.3875,5.2711,0.9759,2.161,8.0261,7.0308,1.5007,6.3839,5.1876,1.3784,4.2223,0.4131,1.3018,4.2271,6.5509,6.542,0.1397,0.3118,2.7118,2.7384,6.3296,2.8583,2.1532,5.11,2.0783,5.9383,0.8246,1.3184,7.6567,3.6714,8.6449,2.4811,0.2255,1.828,3.1832,1.8371,1.1767,6.3344,4.3545,5.0707,2.6008,0.496,4.9458,4.4188,6.3845,0.5001,1.4235,6.5596,14.7194,7.0063,1.3968,3.2223,0.2282,3.0607,0.9541,1.5275,1.6506,3.2125,3.6812,7.5389,0.0677,2.4565,3.5594,0.1463,2.7873,4.4606,4.2393,1.1401,1.7624,3.0968,2.4223,1.9446,3.1164,1.6659,6.0067,0.0311,0.0132,4.2421,0.2932,4.8641,2.5824,0.4775,1.3632,1.2438,0.6471,5.0655,0.5708,1.7866,1.8353,0.5073,2.8877,1.4436,4.904,4.9437,1.6618,0.0308,0.7035,5.1065,1.1408,4.0796,4.1452,2.0913,3.8587,0.2826,6.6125,4.6284,0.4798,5.0829,0.9606,0.045,2.4343,2.2805,2.5688,5.1106,6.0213,3.9112,7.7897,1.7346,3.9215,3.6208,1.5138,5.9682,1.0603,3.9494,4.2913,1.482,2.7556,7.2027,7.6201,0.0143,3.2931,5.5236,1.141,0.8505,1.3678,2.4898,0.4027,3.815,1.238,2.6005,1.6864,2.6369,4.8184,1.5165,1.7526,8.5641,0.084,0.2841,6.9669,3.8992,2.0458,1.4332,9.757,0.096,1.3789,7.8085,4.3173,0.7497,4.5824,2.7829,6.6106,0.0176,1.7296,3.7287,1.9892,0.2734,2.33,1.2018,2.878,0.5281,1.1753,5.2076,5.6972,4.7268,3.4078,4.3853,8.0968,0.1841,1.7191,1.3431,6.6606,4.6832,0.2444,4.8367,0.9255,2.8591,0.9356,3.4045,0.4198,1.0316,8.0949,5.0881,7.495,0.0015,0.4318,3.1181,5.5882,8.4104,8.3508,0.4518,10.9526,1.6678,5.8094,6.4749,0.2256,1.4779,1.6676,3.9823,0.6385,4.7353,0.3251,2.1951,2.0019,2.3891,2.6656,3.9223,5.8979,0.4224,1.7721,3.2866,2.0224,7.4693,4.4004,6.1586,0.9941,5.1422,5.754,0.5485,2.5507,1.0531,1.7191,5.6222,1.8377,4.4471,0.3227,0.1735,3.4029,2.324,6.3452,8.6384,0.3381,2.349,1.0231,1.4813,0.1392,1.8751,4.101,0.2888,1.5007,2.646,5.8318,2.2992,0.6763,4.0053,5.2267,3.3657,1.7192,4.611,1.6952,4.9743,3.1075,3.8558,2.4686,6.5108,6.1613,1.4775,3.4272,4.8402,0.0489,1.2417,3.4827,2.1201,1.9718,0.3581,3.6131,3.1795,0.6685,4.944,2.2289,6.0363,1.8432,4.7776,0.6469,2.4084,0.7614,2.4832,4.1728,0.0357,2.3865,2.8663,2.2226,6.8937,1.157,0.4261,6.4881,1.1109,3.1432,5.3679,0.3978,3.5745,2.9704,0.2222,4.7117,0.4971,3.0261,2.1645,2.2294,1.3198,0.844,0.9993,1.3376,4.399,5.3948,1.1838,6.3461,4.1102,2.3841,6.9216,1.2827,6.9472,0.8703,1.4214,8.4659,0.1532,17.6886,3.1353,2.8701,7.8118,3.7141,4.0448,4.0544,5.7693,1.1652,1.3991,7.5211,2.0935,4.789,6.1327,0.4279,3.0313,0.7292,2.7718,1.9032,0.4017,2.6591,5.0472,2.8917,2.6607,5.6332,0.4737,0.4656,5.4824,4.0995,0.492,3.1035,0.8965,0.8806,0.4377,2.5772,5.2092,1.4329,0.8028,3.4946,0.2887,2.7792,0.5477,2.4762,3.8731,2.9463,5.8767,2.3655,3.3595,3.4557,1.6744,0.3614,1.3442,9.479,0.757,0.7116,2.4726,3.8968,4.3727,3.7256,5.9061,5.729,1.0726,0.006,3.9653,1.5424,1.8848,0.2477,2.387,4.6287,1.0625,6.1468,0.8113,7.4438,0.0616,3.6562,0.767,3.1176,7.3594,2.1972,2.5723,2.4792,5.0895,0.4314,6.1844,0.0024,1.2335,1.9622,0.5416,3.2141,3.8171,2.7461,3.8927,0.6985,2.285,3.5763,3.5605,1.0673,0.3434,2.1683,3.7606,5.3066,0.0355,2.2044,2.2056,2.3212,0.1849,0.6323,1.7711,0.3937,3.7537,5.0045,6.7472,0.2349,2.9757,0.1598,2.5133,0.351,0.1217,2.1726,2.5954,0.7331,3.8363,2.6666,3.7657,2.3432,1.3863,0.4285,4.1987,0.8063,5.1516,4.4553,1.2401,6.0721,0.8802,2.4548,1.0106,3.2377,0.4174,1.2706,5.8709,5.7959,2.3087,1.6487,7.6465,0.0768,1.6623,4.9352,0.3132,4.3182,3.0615,4.5601,1.0435,0.796,3.2228,0.3793,5.8151,0.7917,4.2762,3.9522,0.7322,7.1791,9.1949,8.092,0.0002,4.8693,5.9844,1.5717,3.8929,0.3106,6.4587,0.3141,7.1569,0.0192,0.0006,1.5321,2.1975,0.4016,4.9465,2.9693,4.9086,4.0768,6.5935,1.6351,2.5005,2.4599,1.283,0.7803,3.5468,0.4296,3.0977,2.4161,3.6853,2.1928,3.878,3.5111,2.1142,2.5083,5.3148,2.7303,1.913,2.2057,2.4231,4.5034,6.2225,1.0133,5.1469,0.6352,2.4993,5.2885,3.2463,10.1058,2.6137,6.2909,0.1689,2.8557,2.1274,2.2588,3.5744,0.1324,5.5622,5.5363,5.714,1.7938,0.271,1.3283,4.0912,1.1058,4.843,0.6511,5.2167,0.5254,0.1651,0.0088,4.6909,2.5006,4.3873,0.6806,4.5677,1.3379,0.0987,0.3812,4.2331,4.9728,0.71,2.9008,2.0881,6.2673,1.2628,9.0365,0.0592,0.5531,3.8698,0.8143,1.3818,2.5415,4.7667,4.1602,6.728,1.9881,0.8423,6.6327,4.6537,1.3277,3.6254,5.3978,0.5612,0.2423,0.0059,3.3593,1.5025,0.3413,1.7485,1.6102,1.7613,0.4475,7.4236,8.4635,0.8026,3.6267,0.3029,4.514,5.7491,0.3685,2.042,3.2212,3.595,1.249,0.8924,5.1227,5.7354,5.0701,4.1314,2.8815,5.9767,0.0752,5.3117,0.0194,1.3219,1.0922,0.6229,6.502,3.9415,2.906,0.1854,5.6707,0.9166,7.2754,0.31,2.1477,4.0182,1.3882,3.3894,1.4004,6.5242,1.5247,1.7581,2.2955,5.2119,0.3153,0.5006,1.1864,2.4338,2.4297,4.0465,0.531,7.9769,1.4901,0.3678,0.2522,0.5703,3.0822,0.1205,0.629]}
{"prompt":"You are given a device by someone that allows you to hear an audio recording of your final moments alive .","text":"You are given a device by someone that allows you to hear an audio recording of your final moments alive. The device also prevents you from using the audio control features to stop the recording. Now you need to put your earphones on to hear the recording. It sounds like the speaker above you is talking, though they are unable to see you. You decide to stay. You begin to move from a standing position to an unreachable chair. You take in some oxygen, then try to move a finger on the armrest but it is unresponsive. After several attempts to move it, you are able to reach it. You rest your head on the armrest. After a few moments you begin to notice a strong light that surrounds you, as though it was emanating from your head. You begin to feel heavy. You turn to see that the light surrounding you is from a light bulb in the ceiling of the apartment, though you cannot see it as the light surrounds you. The person recording you asks you to tell them where to focus more of the light on the floor. You turn your head to look at the floor. You hear a voice repeating: \"Come now, put it down on the floor. I can see the floor from up here. I can feel it.\" The person then tells you to come over here and stand upright and move your head left and then right. It takes you several attempts but you eventually are able to move your head. You then rest your forehead on the floor and see some objects floating around. The sound of some metal scraping on metal starts to drift off into the background before you can stop it. You listen for a few seconds before hearing a voice saying: \"I am so glad we have made it to the end of the recording.\" It then stops. The audio stops too, and when you try to replay the recording the play button fails to work. Your partner and your family arrive to find you and realize that you have been in an accident in an alley but you have managed to reach the house. How did you get there, or even what happened next? Explain your response.\n\nA:\n\nThe person recording you asks you to tell them where to\n  focus more of the light on the floor. You turn to see that the\n  light surrounding you is from a light bulb in the ceiling of the\n  apartment, though you cannot see it as the light surrounds you.\n\nAs of this point you could not tell from the audio whether you were in a room or outdoors. But what you did is that you turned \"upside down\" in your own body (i.e. you moved your head left and then right) with \"outside\" as the ceiling. Hence, turning toward where there is an overhead light coming from.\nFor what happens next, we need to take a little time to examine the scene:\n\nyou hear the sound of some metal scraping on metal but you can not stop it. This is from the person doing his task that has a car or motorcycle accident in the street. Note that he is talking to you while you are \"upside down\".\nthe person asks you \"where do you want to put your weight?\" meaning that he wants you to move to some other place within the room. And to this fact, another fact is that the light is coming from an overhead light that would reflect to some other part of the same space, thus you get some movement from turning your head left and then right.","token_len":708,"entropy":[3.8827,6.85,1.1977,7.2213,3.7142,4.4642,3.3996,3.6015,0.2693,0.0867,6.9548,4.8587,1.6868,2.8162,1.1275,1.4046,8.6171,3.4648,10.5941,0.7666,2.3822,1.0619,4.464,6.3556,0.6662,0.0206,3.637,1.6018,4.257,7.6402,5.1244,3.6621,5.1472,1.3942,0.5201,0.8086,6.3819,1.3751,4.5065,0.1843,5.3757,1.8038,4.3897,1.013,1.2305,2.316,1.5661,1.1092,1.5713,0.8572,3.919,4.1376,1.4517,2.7953,4.9172,6.6385,2.5173,1.803,5.2338,2.5298,5.3025,5.6479,1.0675,7.2313,0.0088,4.3691,1.762,0.7349,2.404,5.9281,0.5185,5.5403,6.3592,2.2297,5.1369,0.7429,3.7322,4.0719,4.3252,3.6584,0.1164,0.8803,3.0173,8.9857,0.5791,6.263,0.7731,1.4572,4.9314,4.0625,4.1691,8.3715,1.4227,2.6945,4.5634,0.3841,2.7809,4.093,4.8144,3.1869,0.5002,5.9772,0.8554,5.7336,1.432,1.8252,6.0198,0.1347,0.3033,4.2326,3.4808,2.3617,2.0689,0.8397,2.2009,0.9879,0.9258,2.4632,1.7569,0.0125,4.028,2.7194,1.2621,1.356,7.1083,0.4876,0.9856,0.5897,0.4118,0.8963,0.0045,1.8569,3.6272,1.0563,0.7186,1.5488,2.0098,3.579,0.1257,3.6526,2.1361,6.4388,4.7647,3.8587,5.6799,0.4363,2.539,3.9228,2.7162,1.3925,1.8991,5.2857,0.047,1.4701,2.1073,0.1607,1.1144,2.9502,0.1531,1.9902,6.4379,2.2702,1.0438,5.086,2.0128,1.5771,3.1807,1.4916,1.3704,7.4033,0.2809,0.3316,5.1585,1.4363,4.0186,2.2261,2.5212,1.0658,2.0031,3.0714,1.0924,4.1675,3.0438,3.8339,1.5866,2.4747,0.3729,0.8754,3.8867,3.155,1.529,6.8094,0.433,0.3013,2.2856,4.3894,9.0742,0.7467,4.0309,0.6722,0.9294,4.8032,0.9294,2.1999,2.6139,6.7082,7.557,3.2135,2.1799,0.4997,2.8886,2.5042,4.0142,0.8186,0.8095,4.5665,1.9392,0.3639,0.87,1.7118,0.6801,0.4639,3.7489,1.4082,1.4943,2.0904,1.0382,3.0449,6.6967,2.9567,0.3244,4.7399,4.4432,0.619,5.3456,3.4906,2.6432,3.3576,0.517,0.7125,1.4542,2.115,2.8235,2.3696,2.3842,3.517,2.6396,5.881,0.9854,1.3033,1.6341,0.7207,3.3467,1.4006,2.1273,1.9047,0.7611,3.6018,3.302,0.031,0.9737,4.6207,3.1043,1.9809,1.0314,4.3033,5.776,2.7416,3.3502,1.0208,0.9079,6.0587,0.9615,7.2952,0.1016,0.7949,3.7987,2.977,1.0741,2.9015,3.4438,5.6483,0.7125,3.2916,5.9412,0.0465,0.0049,1.1872,0.5216,0.1221,2.4099,1.1801,2.9218,6.3179,0.0502,6.0497,0.574,0.156,1.077,1.3934,3.057,5.1157,5.3084,3.2275,1.5378,0.9957,1.9362,4.3414,1.2182,3.295,3.8122,3.7388,2.0896,3.1614,5.5409,0.1532,7.6154,1.8537,3.1633,0.4506,1.2002,6.5225,1.2929,1.1038,3.9489,0.3455,0.1706,0.9635,5.9832,2.2286,0.4827,1.6414,0.5833,2.5171,5.1158,1.2942,2.0418,2.4503,0.6821,0.0532,2.3726,2.4019,5.1954,2.2267,3.9277,2.6186,4.4487,0.4055,1.4335,0.7159,1.9783,0.8681,0.8318,4.5566,1.5008,3.4728,2.1621,2.8353,1.6178,1.8967,5.3958,5.0157,7.187,1.8545,1.4449,5.1708,0.4295,3.0442,0.391,6.5209,0.8559,1.1442,3.7851,9.2636,4.9708,5.9866,2.4364,1.7048,0.2963,3.9121,6.7737,4.6305,2.2648,4.4605,4.1036,1.9284,3.0902,0.7146,3.4821,7.0407,0.834,0.9055,1.5482,1.5539,4.1763,2.8514,1.9222,4.9951,3.5242,3.0179,6.5536,1.9419,1.9229,3.5777,0.0082,4.5436,0.7473,6.1125,1.0793,6.9339,1.3701,0.423,1.1072,1.3028,3.5743,4.5625,4.1252,1.3415,1.2772,4.2066,0.1918,7.6386,2.4172,8.1221,1.48,2.798,0.0593,4.5104,3.8329,4.0006,0.0001,2.5171,2.9099,1.8664,0.2591,2.3835,0.2885,0.2208,0.636,0.02,0.024,0.0459,11.7372,15.1314,13.9526,0.2775,0.2005,0.0293,0.0978,0.0628,0.0923,0.0506,0.9083,1.0543,0.4876,3.4364,0.2045,0.6271,0.0207,7.3043,10.9009,0.9767,1.3146,0.035,0.0566,0.1788,0.2545,0.4746,0.0121,0.0271,0.0372,0.0418,0.0466,0.0609,1.6087,10.4057,2.7007,0.5695,0.2133,0.2051,0.0196,0.0906,0.0608,0.045,0.0836,0.9807,0.1707,0.0994,0.0353,2.3754,0.0004,5.2347,5.9155,2.1368,3.5322,1.9226,5.2628,1.6704,2.824,3.5054,0.587,3.1079,4.1998,1.5868,0.5945,1.3429,1.5188,4.758,0.6675,7.123,0.5402,4.0715,3.6786,1.877,2.3745,5.5677,3.6629,0.4648,3.9508,7.3781,8.4467,1.3714,0.1575,0.2766,3.3143,2.2329,5.2609,4.5318,4.5875,3.6886,0.0022,0.0007,0.6185,2.4924,3.0579,1.0507,0.6057,3.2076,0.4298,3.3891,0.3223,1.6677,5.1304,5.8209,8.1885,1.6598,3.5021,1.3284,6.9004,0.8968,7.5492,1.2775,8.4656,6.6001,5.9312,5.0124,0.5118,2.8231,5.0359,0.7771,5.7678,0.4581,2.2956,1.6645,18.2139,5.0654,5.0254,1.1068,0.5617,3.2911,2.2268,0.1635,3.477,0.5319,4.5433,1.8603,0.3025,4.767,0.8336,3.9329,4.2987,0.7601,0.0002,7.1374,4.2315,1.97,1.4676,0.153,1.4486,0.1771,0.0308,0.0837,0.0642,6.2837,1.5854,0.868,2.8097,4.1547,0.2321,0.7707,4.0992,1.0485,5.1115,1.4597,5.1253,5.9637,6.5098,6.6831,5.9763,4.1764,3.4652,6.3208,4.2129,3.5654,7.7073,2.5948,1.0803,3.7869,0.5875,7.3196,0.869,2.09,1.2956,3.5852,1.0789,1.7704,3.5459,1.1772,0.3608,5.7205,5.7501,0.0515,0.0208,1.5457,1.3548,17.6941,0.8603,8.5841,0.0386,6.4372,2.173,3.1433,0.0706,1.0331,0.1803,3.5722,1.3004,8.2833,1.4494,6.9002,1.8409,1.6866,3.283,0.6977,0.062,2.4545,2.965,5.1968,1.8929,1.1979,6.9047,1.1861,2.9533,0.8367,5.8745,4.642,2.2898,8.3418,1.0348,6.0643,5.5973,1.2831,0.656,1.7239,3.4336,1.7157,1.6502,0.1292,3.6586,1.7019,1.0714,2.5847,5.2345,6.8096,5.8762,3.5606,1.4715,4.0058,0.0642,0.367,7.0857,3.0238,2.5999,4.2741,2.9724,5.6237,3.2224,5.4437,1.4571,7.3036,1.5811,0.1028,2.583,0.2588,2.5976,0.094,0.3798]}

As you step out, you gasp at the sight you see... A man of unknown age and race wanders out from the ruins of the ruins. Looking shocked and frightened, a child looking like you runs to him. A tear falls from his eyes, and a smile spreads widely on his face.\nI have a question that I would like to try and ask of all of you to help me out of my doubt. I have an 11 month old girl son and am wanting to adopt a child from the warmer countries and have some concerns. Please feel free to ask me questions about your questions as I may not be experienced in all the things I said to.\nI am a 23 yrs -old student from Ireland who has just moved to the states to attend Westchester Institute. I wish to be a social worker, or something similar in this field. I have done some research on welfare and all that goes with it in the states. It seems, I believe I am in a better place than what I have in the states because I have heard about how much of a huge problem welfare is in states and I would like to try and work on alleviating that problem in my state.\nMy question is, how does it work to file for Welfare if you have been there for a while? I have been there for, oh, something like 3 years. I am aware of what I can get and how much it will cost, but I have never worked that part of it. For example, where do I go when I need to apply for some kind of grant or I really just need some sort of help? Most of my questions go that route in regards to the way they work in the states. If someone could help out, I would greatly appreciate it.\nI have been dealing with some financial difficulties lately, having lost my job and having to find a new job. After reading your articles I now understand why money is so important. However, I do not know anyone who can help me. So my question is this, what help can be obtained when you do not have a place to stay or have no money for your bills and food?\nYou will understand in the coming weeks, or even years, the value of learning to manage your money responsibly. However, even with your best efforts, it is inevitable that you experience some times of financial difficulty in life. Your best bet is to start learning how to manage your finances at an early stage and before something happens.\nIf you are like most people and have the ability to save, you may not have the finances to fund things that you want or need for now. If, even though you are not saving, you have the ability to find and pay all of your bills on time, then you will save your money during the months and years to come. You can make good on your debt much sooner than you expect.\nThe first thing I want to tell you is that it is important to think about how you spend your money. There is a wide variance in people around the world in terms of how much they can afford to spend and how they spend their money. There are people who just buy things that they don\u2019t need and people that have a hard time buying things with the money they have. When you buy things that you don\u2019t need that are high in prices and low in value, then you are wasting your money.","token_len":709,"entropy":[3.8827,2.7333,7.8442,0.8821,0.1979,2.7649,1.671,3.4271,7.731,1.2463,4.9367,2.7552,7.0118,1.9033,4.1151,2.344,5.0611,1.3063,4.1261,1.0893,5.3563,1.2477,2.6625,0.7426,7.7928,2.7597,0.4331,1.7589,5.0963,1.7416,5.7884,4.7445,3.5669,5.7974,4.1396,1.6643,2.1531,4.6178,9.505,0.0012,3.3103,2.3635,1.3268,4.8527,0.6859,1.0837,5.0614,1.6397,5.6925,6.8692,1.8971,2.7596,0.3205,4.7775,6.2449,7.0192,3.965,3.1665,5.3064,2.0322,1.3297,1.3686,3.2309,6.1076,3.0901,0.9698,0.6859,1.8477,2.1639,1.02,3.0359,3.9918,1.7537,5.9177,1.779,0.3953,0.1128,0.2756,2.9648,6.1742,3.1171,2.7139,2.975,4.0557,1.7924,2.4258,0.1482,0.211,6.14,1.4179,2.9824,4.8805,4.8544,0.9987,0.078,4.6512,1.2596,0.618,2.8056,3.0359,2.0152,8.3131,0.5495,2.5859,1.9409,3.986,5.5138,4.0253,0.019,2.4898,8.7898,2.3943,5.8173,7.2212,0.285,6.9788,3.2576,1.8098,2.6373,2.0117,12.0868,4.884,3.2067,3.3818,4.2536,6.8182,1.9278,4.265,3.7105,0.0127,0.0089,2.598,1.5195,2.0629,1.8241,1.4682,4.3553,3.6237,1.808,3.0561,2.5523,0.7399,9.2387,1.597,3.3514,2.1878,4.904,1.6961,5.4377,3.2893,7.3565,1.2754,1.7936,1.27,2.0983,4.789,6.4506,1.6596,8.0272,2.9179,3.9877,2.1784,6.1122,1.6018,1.4822,2.0983,3.3442,0.499,1.2527,8.1847,2.7759,2.9474,7.2215,4.4808,6.5682,1.9305,0.8578,5.7395,0.3513,2.7005,2.1399,6.0003,0.1334,2.7481,4.7224,4.0455,1.3263,3.3981,3.2365,4.2303,0.5948,0.9069,1.8393,5.2056,1.9717,1.161,1.2317,4.6712,1.4749,6.339,3.6859,3.5515,0.7903,0.2037,4.2143,1.6317,4.7393,1.1949,3.9318,2.1033,6.2434,2.4056,3.7453,4.1333,1.5134,3.5313,1.3481,2.2622,0.9255,1.4134,4.0312,0.5393,2.3816,3.6841,1.0324,1.7347,3.9255,1.055,1.3982,5.8313,2.8304,3.5739,2.6605,3.2872,1.0941,6.1239,2.4749,2.1544,0.7294,1.029,4.8539,2.6869,2.0456,3.0644,0.4334,0.1188,3.6101,0.5178,4.4555,1.9221,5.6492,0.036,1.396,0.9015,3.1298,1.1267,2.3005,0.3283,1.0967,3.3121,3.0011,0.5253,1.3943,1.9568,3.2481,2.0644,2.043,3.3769,9.712,2.4841,5.9169,5.4197,0.7858,1.7841,2.4253,4.8145,1.0395,1.7913,1.3624,0.8539,1.7987,1.3805,1.6601,1.1934,0.5501,6.9684,4.616,1.0622,7.4635,0.3576,3.06,0.6185,1.465,1.1993,2.0992,5.6728,1.2359,3.3596,1.7383,3.7316,3.7077,3.6477,2.2414,2.1133,2.3971,3.2134,0.2855,2.3108,0.5078,0.9704,1.9551,2.2197,4.1669,4.1022,5.9284,0.5346,3.9872,0.9771,5.3154,2.0729,0.1746,5.8789,1.8255,1.0028,1.3837,2.0619,0.2941,3.0083,0.8225,4.3494,0.2849,6.0602,2.5487,0.0041,5.8723,1.633,5.7735,6.3415,4.1702,1.226,2.7816,3.6528,0.0017,2.4459,1.3682,6.0079,1.1806,1.4996,5.9209,4.39,7.0448,6.0979,5.0811,5.1265,0.0217,2.8332,5.4651,3.3576,2.2613,2.9449,1.103,0.5756,0.5192,3.6011,4.1945,4.4901,1.1847,3.8425,1.6552,1.4068,0.4881,5.67,0.0776,0.1074,0.3162,1.1057,1.2646,1.5181,1.6231,6.0053,0.0214,3.5043,5.0937,2.0976,3.9841,1.6336,5.156,3.7069,1.1597,0.7182,1.3455,3.3895,0.8854,3.1059,1.0582,0.6642,1.3814,0.9496,5.3078,5.1164,2.6329,4.3385,2.2496,5.7344,3.064,1.9765,7.1231,0.7805,1.8902,0.4621,1.5433,4.5639,0.1547,1.0241,2.4196,0.9731,2.0171,6.185,0.4618,2.3548,1.0207,0.862,2.3332,3.7609,4.188,0.8182,0.3618,3.2334,1.4452,1.9119,5.0046,1.6875,4.0206,5.0232,3.8127,0.6113,3.5431,0.5354,0.5044,1.4959,3.4967,0.3809,2.4686,2.4494,3.7613,2.4021,2.1398,2.8588,2.7292,5.3884,2.575,4.8522,1.0739,1.0728,4.2516,3.4471,5.3922,3.4627,2.2477,3.9832,1.1336,2.7402,5.4408,2.0496,2.6622,0.7236,4.0911,6.1061,0.2092,8.3945,2.1214,4.5642,0.7878,2.1117,5.9153,0.6287,3.9643,0.0598,5.3276,2.9255,2.5394,2.9317,0.8493,0.6895,2.3345,1.0217,6.8131,0.1645,1.0163,8.6547,2.5491,7.3934,1.7273,1.4171,1.8017,3.5842,3.304,0.3519,4.3542,3.7793,1.6569,0.5696,0.2458,4.1563,4.1203,2.049,0.0748,0.5626,0.2553,2.1609,4.8096,3.2394,0.2069,4.781,1.7477,6.5664,7.9918,3.5157,1.7997,1.2232,2.9,0.3021,1.409,5.8927,1.614,1.0562,2.8906,2.162,3.9185,2.3205,0.2835,4.8776,1.7821,1.293,2.5313,2.1142,1.3147,1.5469,5.1873,0.3122,5.7522,3.9197,2.932,0.7517,2.8367,3.7278,0.5803,3.1825,5.7402,0.2715,2.9417,4.1591,6.5997,2.4646,0.3338,1.2824,3.0125,4.5482,1.2804,0.4423,1.8541,2.117,1.7643,0.0767,4.8299,4.71,2.5888,6.2252,1.3053,0.441,0.3836,4.3477,0.1738,0.5553,1.7816,0.8584,1.4203,5.537,4.9359,0.2612,7.0117,1.2543,4.628,1.7341,0.2375,1.3482,0.0054,0.2233,2.8434,2.2164,3.7226,4.0197,3.319,0.8272,3.544,9.6727,2.8767,0.9483,0.6832,4.504,0.7418,0.953,3.3311,3.7904,1.04,1.9591,2.0808,0.2041,2.865,0.085,0.4942,0.4238,3.1475,0.385,2.748,0.4198,4.5286,0.8309,2.1537,0.7902,3.8417,0.1573,0.4398,0.7799,3.7706,1.2996,1.5245,4.8488,6.3426,0.7011,4.8544,6.1204,0.7517,0.1149,4.5856,1.429,0.0031,1.007,0.356,0.7117,4.499,1.9213,0.9903,0.3877,1.9615,0.7248,2.6942,1.7406,0.8783,0.3516,0.2395,3.4766,0.6304,2.5813,0.5592,5.0972,4.9386,2.977,2.0932,0.8154,2.5412,16.8664,7.007,2.5248,1.0749,1.5885,3.3547,2.8562,2.873,2.5739,4.0399,0.0522,3.8228,0.7171,5.082,2.8345,1.3154,0.4051,0.7755,0.7893,4.5292,0.7675,4.0166,1.1324,1.5625,0.4174,1.5054,0.5669,0.3765,0.0085,0.1504,4.1683,2.7812,5.1137,0.5564,4.5122,1.5206,2.3178,0.0585,0.7701,0.3796,1.8985,0.5956,1.4475,4.4485,0.5874,0.4314,0.5187]}
{"prompt":"You are an astronaut living aboard the ISS .

You are forced, one day, to look on in horror as, seemingly without warning, nuclear war engulfs the Earth. You rush, therefore, to a bunker under the control of an elderly man. As the time ticks by towards an hour, the man who has already taken measures to ensure there is not a nuclear attack takes your hand. He assures you that you and all the astronauts, including him, will be dead before you know it.\nOf course not. This is a science fiction story, not a prediction of the apocalypse. But it is possible that the ISS was not built for an hour of civilized life, but for the lifetime of a human race. But the ISS may have been built with limited fuel in mind with an inevitable, although unknown, end date.\nI have a similar theory for the Apollo program as a whole.\nAn asteroid will strike a moon sometime during the Apollo era sometime between late 1969 and early 1972. I find the year 1972 particularly important because on 1 february 1972, president Richard Nixon, and members of both the congress and senate visited the moon.\nThere is no question that space exploration is a top national priority. But I think, that with an astounding national debt, this national priority is based on misguided notions of national glory and the need to fill perceived gaps in what you have achieved in space so far.\nThe Apollo program was a great national success. The program created a great sense of national pride, provided a model for the civilized use of resources and technology, as well as a vast amount of information about the human body and its place in the Solar System. The program produced more technology in a smaller, less expensive way than anyone was expecting and delivered a few precious samples of the surface of the moon to bring back to Earth and study.\nAs the time goes by, when the astronauts come back from the moon and begin recounting the events and observations of the trip to the moon, this newsworthy events will fade into the past and forgotten.\nBut I believe, that the history books will never tell you the full story. It will be only history books that tell a story based on how it happened, and not how it could have happened and what was really going on at the time and who did not say what was in their minds and what the real reasons behind the decisions made were.\nI am not trying to suggest that the Apollo program was an irresponsible or unprofitable program, but the program was clearly a top priority at the times when it was pursued. This is, of course, my theory and no one is going to give any credit or blame to me for suggesting that. But I am not convinced that this is, in fact, the case. I think the political and propaganda pressure, as well as the lack of an alternate energy source to propel a spaceship towards the moon, was probably driving the program rather than the desire to investigate the moon as an object of exploration. I think the desire of a president and the people he represented to impress his constituents is also an influencing factor.\nThis is, of course, a speculative idea, but I feel that it is worth the effort to investigate. The reality of space exploration and the current direction of space exploration over the years suggests that space exploration will become part of national history, but not as a national priority.\nThere are other factors that are involved but, ultimately, this is an interesting theory that I am looking forward to hearing from

{"prompt":"In an interesting twist , a demon summons *you*","text":"In an interesting twist, a demon summons *you* to his dimension. When you finally appear, he starts beating you up. *Oy, hey, wait, he is my brother, he just wants to see you in pain & show you his power! *\nIf you think you are strong, you can save your life & go back to your dimension. You will get away with it the first time, but this demon will keep getting stronger every time and you will just be getting beaten harder. I started beating the hell out of this demon to get some blood. *Hmm, I think it is time for another ritual of blood sacrifice of the innocent. * You take some of the victim\u2019s blood and smear it on your weapons & clothes, thinking that is it. Hmm, the demon is stronger than I thought and it started eating my blood like it is some type of protein. You think you do not need or have any blood sacrifice and you will go back to your dimension.\nThe demon starts eating blood from your clothes, you start getting weak & tired. Your friends appear and they help you get some blood to fight him, a demon that is only defeated by a ritual of blood sacrifice of the innocent. So, they give you blood. But, now you are losing the struggle and you think you should die, but the demon just drags you into the demon world and eats your blood. Now you are dead. You wake up in your home and think \u2013 I died a horrible death, but a good death, a sacrifice. Your father is angry that I am weak and a slacker and I get beaten like this all the time by my brother and friends.\nHe makes me go to a temple & learn to fight. I learn to fight & kill demons & I kill them. I go to my room and think, *Well I think I am done. I did as my father said, he taught me to fight & I am doing it well. When I am done with my training, I will go back and I will just get angry that he gave me my blood. I am angry & I go back to the demon world and I kill a demon that I thought would be easy and it took me time. Now I feel so good & I just need to rest. I am not getting better, but I just need to stay healthy. *\nYou wake up. You go to your room and you have a book on your bed. You look at the book and you start writing about this. This is the only thing you can write right now. The book is about you. Your book is about you. Your life story. You are a demon and you are a vampire\nMy book is about my adventure with a demon that I caught. Not sure what I am going to do with it or if anyone is going to read it, but maybe someday.\nAs you walk, the sun sets in you. You stop in a lake. You feel refreshed, just like you have done once before.\nYou think about your life and you see that you have lived a great life and you are grateful for every single second of it.\nEvery single one

{"prompt":"Write a seemingly straightforward comedy story that slowly and subtly becomes creepy and unnerving or downright horrifying , all while remaining under the guise of a light-hearted story .","text":"Write a seemingly straightforward comedy story that slowly and subtly becomes creepy and unnerving or downright horrifying, all while remaining under the guise of a light-hearted story. It is the story of two teenagers, one of whom has the ability to become a puppeteer and another, an aspiring actress. The film has a happy ending in that the puppeteer is actually a loving father, but the girl is left heartbroken.\nThis movie has a great theme yet it is hard to say what it is. It is a bit more ambiguous than its title implies and it is not quite as humorous and entertaining as it was originally projected to be.\nThis movie is extremely difficult to describe, however, it is quite funny, has a strong and unusual plot, and takes place in a weird world of alternate realities. I do not wish to discuss the deeper themes and meanings that this movie has, because as I watched it I became more lost and confused than ever.\nI was quite disappointed in this movie, because it\u2019s only a 2 hour movie and yet at the end of it you do not really remember any of the story and feel a little bit confused. It also has a very dark and violent background story and a couple of disturbing scenes.\nI do not rate this movie high enough on IMDB, because it is so absurd and silly, I suppose to maintain its ratings it has to be funny and a bit less disturbing than I would like and also it does not really have much of a plot, although there is some storyline, it is very basic. This movie has one of the most bizarre and funny plots I have ever seen on screen. The characters are all very odd creatures. The humor comes from the absurdity and grotesqueness of the characters.\nI do not want to sound negative about it, but I am not sure why all these people rate it so high on IMDb. There is no real reason to do so, I guess it is like the ratings for Disney movie. It is like we put everything on a scale and the lowest rating is the best. I will not give this movie a high rating because it really isn\u2019t a good movie, especially for people with a normal standard of humor.\nThis is a very strange movie and one of the best of the genre. The plot seems to be quite strange, but it was actually very well executed. The film is quite funny and the actors are excellent. I am not sure if I have been able to review this movie properly. The movie doesn\u2019t really make sense, however, if you were to watch it while reading a book it would make more sense, but the book was actually written to accompany the film.\nThis movie isn\u2019t a very good movie. In fact, it is a mediocre comedy, but, because it is a comedy, the humor is quite good and the actors are all very good and the plot is somewhat better than the other movies of the genre. The movie was a bit slow to start, but, after it had taken off, it was a lot more entertaining and fun.\nThis movie is one that you would like to see, but, one that you don\u2019t want to see. It took me a while to figure out what was going on in that movie, and it seemed like it had a very confusing plot, and it could have been longer. The characters are all strange and the plot is absurd, and I would not recommend it to anyone, but it is definitely worth

{"prompt":"Write a story about the Grim Reaper collecting a soul , only write the Grim Reaper as if he were a friend awkwardly asking for a favour .","text":"Write a story about the Grim Reaper collecting a soul, only write the Grim Reaper as if he were a friend awkwardly asking for a favour. What would a life be like for a Grim Reaper as a friend, would he have something good to say about you or can you ever hope in getting the same as what you got your mother and father.\nIt all happened at a dinner party the other day. My wife and I were having a little pre-nup and she was telling me that all they are looking for in a bride is good genes. I thought that was a great compliment and I would gladly agree with that. If anyone knew what good genes meant that she was describing what she wanted in her future bride it would be me.\nMy first wife had great genes\u2026 she was extremely beautiful and intelligent; we also had a beautiful baby boy.\nAfter she got sick and died, I was devasted. I can honestly say that for at least eighteen years of my life I hardly slept (which is rare for me) and I was having nightmares. I couldn\u2019t function like a normal person. The way I was with my first children was obviously not working out. I didn\u2019t enjoy anything. I went to counseling and everything. After several years of going to this counselor, I had a realization. She wanted to have what she never had and I had what she never had. I was now going to change how I interacted with my next wife and I honestly thought that the next time I would get what I wanted. I was wrong. The next woman that I lived with was the most horrible person that I have ever met in my fifty two years in life. I can\u2019t tell you how much it hurt and it still is a sore spot today. Anyway, time went by and four years after her death I met a girl that was going through a divorce. She seemed like the only single person at the dinner party. I am not sure if it was the look in her eyes or the way she was dressed; I just found it so interesting. It all started when she opened the door and I realized that the whole room was lit with the sun. She looked exactly like my wife\u2019s eyes. I know it was a mistake. I was mad to my stomach and when she was over, I couldn\u2019t tell if she noticed it or not. She was so tall, very beautiful, and also had my wife\u2019s eyes. I couldn\u2019t tell what to do. My gut told me that she was my soulmate but what I didn\u2019t know was what would happen next. The day after we started talking more, we started making out. Her breasts weren\u2019t that big and I think that they both agreed with that. We had a blast and all I did was think about what happened earlier. The next day we walked into a bank to get married. That was the happiest day of my life. I had the greatest love in my life.\nIn that case, my wife and I are like that baby girl. She will probably have the perfect genes in her children and they have good genes in their DNA. But, if I were to look at that girl as a spouse, my wife would have had no choice but to accept what she did to me and now our baby girl has what we both had before her birth.

{"prompt":"A cop arrives at the golden gate bridge to talk a man out of committing suicide . After they have a short conversation , the cop jumps off the bridge .","text":"A cop arrives at the golden gate bridge to talk a man out of committing suicide. After they have a short conversation, the cop jumps off the bridge. When the cop reappears, the man is dead.\nIn a TV News Channel interview, the anchorman says \"It's a matter of time before someone jumps from the Golden Gate Bridge on TV.\" Immediately after that, a woman rushes out, runs up to the TV camera (at the top of the bridge), grabs the TV, drops it, jumps down to her death and hits her head on the concrete.\nThe news media makes a bunch of big headlines stating that the guy who did the Golden Gate Bridge jump has a mental problem or is \"drugged with Prozac\".\nAfter that video ( and many others) of suicidal people jumping off Golden Gate Bridge goes viral, the police start investigating if the suicidal people who jumped are actually mentally unstable.\nSo I am wondering how much \"scientific\" testing have the police and the \"psychiatrists\" ( who work for the police ) done on these people before the \"psychiatric\" and police testing started.\nHow do the scientists, psychiatrists and even \"police\" measure someone that has not experienced any trauma from his life before he decides to jump off a bridge or hang himself or slit his own wrists?\nWhat is the scientifically backed reasoning behind telling people who \"just\" have a \"mental problem\" to simply take some Prozac?\nThis is a thread in the psychology and mental health communities, so I wonder if anyone with any real science background in the field could answer these questions.\nI have read a couple of articles and listened to some Podcasts on this topic, but I have not got a \"scientific answer\" for these questions.\nAfter a few days of the suiciden jumping off the bridge, the media start taking the suiciden's photo and then printing these with a big headline that says, \"Now we know who is the Golden Gate Bridge suiciden. It is the new young guy from Oakland who has an 'interest' in the 'holocaust of the Jews in the Third Reich'.\"\nAs you can see in the media pictures, the man with a big scarred face is on his knees under a large tree and has his hands over his eyes. He looks extremely depressed.\nSo, how can that be possible? This young man jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. Maybe it is just a coincidence?\nHe was a known alcoholic and also had a mental problem. Now it seems like he committed suicide and the media want to blame the \"interest\" in the 'holocaust', instead of him.\nWe can take into account his depression as a contributing factor, but the main causes of most suicidez are :\nIn the 1980s, researchers discovered that when people are suicidal, their brain activity has more activity in areas for emotional reactions, such as response to pain and pleasure. This can explain why people with severe mental health disorders are much more likely to make suicidal attempts than someone who has been depressed, but otherwise has no known mental illness. ( The American Psychoanalytical Society ).\nThe brain activity for suicidal ideation occurs in 2 large lobes of the brain that are involved in emotions, memory, and decision making.

{"prompt":"Write the shortest story possible . The twist ? Include the 3 topics of sex , religion and mystery .","text":"Write the shortest story possible. The twist? Include the 3 topics of sex, religion and mystery. Aside from being hilarious, this is a wonderful and timely book. I bought it for my daughter and it has helped her to talk about sex with her friends. It is also inspiring and empowering.\nThe book starts of with a woman (Jane) describing the situation to her friend (Cathy) because she's afraid of losing her father. Jane's father has recently died and she has found out through her sister (Nora) that it's been the same father for fifty years or so. He seems to love her everytime she comes home. She realizes that her father loves her but she also realizes that he could also be dangerous.\nIt's a short book and I didn't think it was funny, but i thought it was cute. It kind of reminds me of my grandma and grandpa telling stories to me while their backs were turned. It's nice to be related to someone the way Jane's father is with her.\nI was initially a little skeptical because of the price but, this book was worth it. The author does an excellent job of explaining how sex affects one's mind and body, both physically and mentally. It is a great way to discuss sexual issues with your children.\nThis is a short and funny book that is a great way to talk about sex with your children. If you are ever wondering what your children are discussing when they are talking to each other try this book out. The story is funny and interesting and it is easy to read in one sitting.\nJane wants to lose weight so she looks to a gym. She gets in touch with a trainer and starts going to the gym and learning more about fitness. She tries the classes and tries a weight lifting machine. As she keeps going to the gym the trainer is able to see how Jane has become more powerful.\nIf you want to read this book there does not need to be any sexuality involved. This book talks about the power that a person's mind can have over their body, body over mind and mind over body. There is a great message behind this book. You can buy this book at any bookstore.\nThis book is about a man who is gay (Jerry) who lives in a small town in California. He has a relationship that lasts a few years with a man. The book talks about the relationship, the challenges that the two men face and how they get out of the difficult situation that they find themselves. There is a story about Jerry and the other man (Dave) in the book. The plot is nice, the characters are interesting and the message is clear, both men should stand up for their relationships, regardless of what it takes to do so.\nThe book is funny and it is a bit strange, but the message is clear. The story is about a little boy who moves to a new town, he meets a girl (Jennifer) and falls for her. The story is funny, it is about a boy and a girl who are in love and it is about a relationship that is very difficult. The book gives us a perspective on relationships that few young people are aware of.\nI think that this book is a very good book to have in a classroom environment. This story is funny and interesting, it is a good time for the books with the younger students. One should not read this book to students between the ages of twelve and seventy one because the subject matter can expose the students to sexuality, and some people may not like that.","token_len":720,"entropy":[3.6722,9.5759,6.4789,3.4219,1.4154,3.5919,8.623,5.2636,10.13,1.8056,8.0133,8.2584,3.325,7.5705,0.8959,4.1137,0.8689,8.2931,1.0167,9.0284,0.0093,3.8876,5.5135,0.3652,1.7804,1.466,1.1859,4.8337,4.1196,6.641,2.8033,0.6958,2.5808,6.7126,0.7431,1.7031,1.4361,2.3534,1.9765,2.3803,2.4037,3.279,1.6136,1.8008,5.901,0.4231,2.9614,3.3792,2.08,2.5889,1.0658,1.9891,1.5282,2.2328,5.1446,2.5757,5.5267,1.0643,1.8404,6.2733,2.3386,3.9342,7.9677,0.696,1.1377,5.0855,4.5851,5.7078,1.0421,4.8392,2.5101,4.9274,4.0573,0.6156,1.616,1.7158,4.7341,3.2607,0.9487,5.3767,0.8978,2.8572,3.851,0.8098,4.3599,0.5179,5.0519,0.7222,2.6116,3.4318,4.0601,2.6672,3.5772,1.489,0.935,1.604,2.3681,4.8738,1.6766,6.3769,1.5791,3.9019,1.9002,4.5425,3.2194,0.1461,0.231,4.5441,1.176,3.2176,4.2542,1.4491,2.6604,1.6047,7.5286,0.1474,6.0417,0.9565,0.1942,3.9024,5.4635,0.5459,4.1541,0.3845,5.4227,6.1911,0.6537,2.9467,1.3622,1.5955,2.1078,5.2777,0.7582,2.856,0.6861,4.5401,0.1129,3.0925,1.3983,4.0177,1.9432,0.3751,1.2232,5.4256,5.1131,1.2379,6.3538,1.3338,2.7895,4.3872,1.6942,1.5851,5.07,3.1444,1.6206,1.9403,4.1565,0.0006,2.8695,0.9345,1.3357,4.4428,2.7586,0.4315,8.3989,3.113,0.2795,0.5237,6.2304,0.6663,1.9401,6.6271,0.0013,2.5131,0.1024,0.1175,3.2174,6.377,3.23,5.4982,0.167,4.1295,1.8861,2.7189,2.4717,3.691,5.5071,8.5288,0.8707,0.6714,1.0842,1.904,0.9576,4.5441,0.5017,3.3265,9.3008,0.174,2.9682,6.9028,0.3831,4.6351,3.0561,2.2833,2.1116,3.7079,0.9103,1.2065,1.0559,2.0671,3.3012,5.5942,3.4774,0.9418,1.6985,3.3593,2.3983,0.6114,5.9254,1.9898,5.922,4.932,1.0683,2.0815,2.236,0.7761,0.4603,2.2301,3.2041,3.9277,2.0876,0.9024,0.0057,0.5897,2.3288,2.1317,2.6895,3.942,4.2176,0.206,4.1615,0.8077,1.7863,2.1861,5.3249,1.5112,0.0411,1.1153,0.1152,1.6682,2.1369,1.8513,2.3155,2.2381,0.1491,4.0576,3.9902,2.2299,2.946,1.3296,2.6176,1.0391,1.383,2.8037,1.1694,1.0022,4.5444,3.007,2.9888,0.2613,2.0703,2.2442,2.9109,1.8925,1.3178,0.0928,2.3563,0.2421,0.8904,2.0568,0.2341,0.8979,0.274,3.8339,0.1704,1.3685,5.5443,3.224,1.1423,2.7997,1.994,1.4356,7.4135,3.9478,0.7564,0.9842,2.5526,1.3987,2.7744,0.0149,6.9501,0.5675,0.4966,1.3774,0.4835,3.1759,3.3366,0.9677,2.8169,0.7011,3.6334,1.1774,2.1295,1.6922,3.6787,0.0907,1.2105,4.1542,3.513,0.2711,0.1979,1.2318,5.2594,6.7623,0.2321,4.7968,5.9626,2.7586,0.4421,5.6291,3.05,3.505,4.0226,2.0382,1.2596,3.9901,3.928,2.2717,0.0698,1.4643,4.2905,1.4238,4.2476,4.2622,0.5873,1.4448,0.0617,2.9119,5.6786,2.9737,0.1201,4.2635,0.7624,1.1206,4.8623,3.7841,7.2472,1.1306,5.0212,4.7077,4.7784,2.6959,5.361,1.1837,4.628,0.6914,5.4303,1.9169,2.4444,0.2046,0.0487,3.7284,0.8255,3.1699,4.1025,0.0014,2.805,2.064,4.9653,3.1412,3.8086,1.5552,4.6957,0.9568,2.0241,4.4404,0.2172,2.5604,0.2256,2.7116,3.1819,0.3975,6.222,7.4453,0.4253,2.5934,0.0241,0.0045,1.5185,10.5652,2.5693,0.6955,2.4557,1.0728,6.0563,0.2045,2.1814,3.2228,3.318,3.2124,2.5364,2.4698,2.5021,1.2998,1.0646,2.1709,1.2163,0.1085,2.5898,2.936,7.7354,1.776,1.546,2.0827,0.048,0.6627,0.5508,3.9806,0.5292,1.8007,2.6847,5.8769,4.3316,1.0127,0.2962,1.0617,4.221,1.1839,4.8747,1.1961,0.1028,2.1806,2.966,1.3973,1.8277,1.0602,1.8217,0.8174,0.6481,4.0698,2.2464,2.1878,0.907,2.0312,6.6051,3.7608,7.7969,0.7913,1.3389,4.11,0.5482,1.3541,2.1677,0.2822,1.1753,3.0636,0.3612,0.7834,1.9576,1.3305,4.6946,5.0381,2.9986,2.9382,1.8557,0.4454,2.575,0.9093,2.2052,3.23,2.0992,4.216,3.3257,0.0958,1.3705,2.4452,2.5736,1.3331,6.4204,1.8972,2.9551,3.5,1.3705,0.1627,1.4734,1.6152,1.0045,4.0827,5.1003,0.2246,2.388,9.4265,0.6413,2.959,1.1273,2.5408,0.0075,6.0083,3.4902,0.5311,0.9744,4.6206,1.2674,2.9832,1.634,1.8955,4.4178,0.801,3.9749,5.6982,0.1655,3.7279,0.8798,0.424,0.6531,2.0248,7.4329,0.9716,5.4586,2.3887,1.6626,1.342,0.4472,1.9264,0.5625,0.9042,5.372,0.4492,2.2332,3.8963,5.0714,2.776,6.5055,6.7408,0.4893,0.3776,2.176,5.2339,2.9457,5.3073,0.029,2.4671,4.0385,1.4722,0.6775,3.3342,0.2619,0.0884,0.7584,2.0393,0.9643,1.1594,4.2636,0.8256,2.5454,0.8814,2.2647,5.1636,5.6537,3.1231,0.5926,2.1804,3.0831,0.4197,1.059,0.9723,2.0063,2.7727,0.8467,1.4842,1.5107,6.5542,1.0214,0.8785,6.0405,1.2371,1.043,1.7869,0.7867,2.9818,3.3079,2.627,0.5556,1.6452,2.3205,4.1492,0.2568,1.1016,5.4317,3.2354,0.3625,0.5025,1.4875,1.8505,0.8106,3.0688,1.6902,2.5191,0.3933,2.8617,1.1649,2.1154,2.0933,1.4176,0.1329,1.1117,1.8647,2.9342,0.771,1.1409,3.4457,0.3034,0.748,1.2689,3.2725,0.8057,1.6933,3.3296,2.8686,1.914,1.5804,1.2356,4.5971,2.7188,0.772,6.2823,0.7658,4.0343,1.7188,6.0632,5.36,1.0761,2.417,1.5042,0.0698,0.5458,1.1687,2.4137,3.4801,3.0345,0.7917,0.3687,0.5834,1.1979,3.6277,0.7622,1.3141,2.9039,1.6492,2.0306,2.3168,4.9076,4.7768,0.5002,3.1709,4.6683,0.743,3.0159,0.6976,2.9234,1.682,1.2701,0.5947,1.9131,1.3983,5.0037,1.8504,3.4785,5.0378,5.8641,2.2135,5.3686,3.5853,1.2571,5.7797,4.4032,1.7016,3.3949,1.1799,0.2235,2.5817,7.3607,7.9973,0.44,0.0167,0.0125,4.1121,0.2653,6.9638,6.2711,2.25,2.2332,4.6262,0.1687,4.5073,8.9294,2.0685,3.7253,0.2212,6.3357,2.5778,2.6977,4.6508,3.1361,1.3849,1.8357,1.9507,2.681,0.74]}
{"prompt":"A man with nothing to lose , and a man with everything to lose are about to fight .","text":"A man with nothing to lose, and a man with everything to lose are about to fight. The man with nothing to lose is called the \" man of his word,\" while the man with everything to lose has the reputation with his name to gain. In short, a man with no enemies is no man.\"\nWarren Beatty was the director for this film, the last film that Sam Peckinpah directed, but is known primarily for his work on The Unforgiven. Peckinpah was awarded the Golden Globe award for Best Director of a Drama Film for \"The Big Lebowski.\" Peckinpah died after the movie was released in 1998.\nI remember seeing this film as a student. I wasn't familiar with the film at the time it was produced, but it remains one of my favorite films ever. John Malkovich and Danny McBride are excellent in their parts and I still laugh when I watch it. Malkovich, who plays a character known as \"Big Lebowski,\" had been in a previous film called The Big Lebowski (1996) and played \"The Big Lebowski\" (as himself)... The movie is very funny, but also very sad.\nI remember reading the book that is based on this film after the movie was released. I had not seen the movie yet of course... The movie contains more violence than the book, but it is still as funny as the movie.\nI don't remember anything about the book (other than it is about a guy named Walter who looks like Sean Penn), so I had to look on the internet for information about it. It turns out it is one of the greatest crime novels of all time, written by Raymond Chandler. It is a great read!\nThe film is also based on a true story, and is even less funny than the book, but it is a great movie none the less!\nI remember this being a movie that was not well known when the book was published. I read the book and have also read the film. It is interesting because it is not a movie to laugh at, although it is funny. At the end of the book, Walter goes from a depressed cripple and alcoholic to a successful realtor, and then has an affair with a neighbor woman, played by Deborah Kerr.\nI love Deborah Kerr. One of my favorite actresses. She is so beautiful in this movie. This movie was a bit depressing for me, as I'm sure it was for Walter. I liked that the final scene was not sad, but rather a happy ending. I remember seeing this movie as a child.\nThis is a favorite movie of mine. It has some great imagery and I would love to see this again. It is definitely my favorite movie.\nI have seen this film many times over the years it was first ever introduced to me. The opening scene with the horse running up to one of the characters had me laughing out loud.\nI loved this film when I was a little girl. My dad bought the soundtrack and I still have the album. I have to laugh, to this day, while listening to it. There are other film, I have not seen, that I enjoy greatly and have saved them for the future. I guess my love for this film will hold with me for a lifetime.\nI just watched it again over the weekend after I had been thinking about it for some time now.

{"prompt":"You accidentally break something at a dinner party and go to ever-increasing lengths to cover it up","text":"You accidentally break something at a dinner party and go to ever-increasing lengths to cover it up, and then later at a party with everyone, your best friends, you say, \u201cRemember when I said I broke that? That\u2019s why I had to find something. I had to say I broken it.\u201d\nBut there are those other days. Sometimes when everyone has a glass of wine, but it\u2019s one with a little less of it, and you don\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s just a normal glass of wine.\nAnd these days, I\u2019ve been finding myself in weird places I never expected to be. I\u2019m finding myself talking to people I never expected to be talking to, and I\u2019m finding myself saying things I never expected to be saying. And I\u2019m surprised every single day about how I keep standing out in the most odd places at the most odd times.\nI\u2019m happy to say, though, that I\u2019ve always been a pretty odd girl. It actually didn\u2019t take me all of my adulthood. Even when I was 13 and I was making it to the pool that had a roof. Even when I was 15 and I was dancing in an all-girls high school dance when a boy took a liking to me one weekend and, well, we stayed involved for a little bit.\nEven when I was in high school and I would talk to my roommates during sex and make jokes about how I had no hair and couldn\u2019t even make it through five minutes without stopping while they had penetrative sex with one another. I know I sound weird.\nEven when I was really bad at school and I got pushed around a lot and people were mean to me and I didn\u2019t always have the best friends, but I didn\u2019t give up. I didn\u2019t always accept. I didn\u2019t always put my head down and try to fix all of this.\nEven when I was making the rounds to my friends at work to find out if they thought I looked good and if they really liked me. Even when I saw people going out together and thinking why couldn\u2019t I? Even when I looked for all the wrong reasons and couldn\u2019t find them.\nAnd that is exactly why I always knew deep down that even when the odds seem stacked against me, sometimes those odds will get smaller and smaller and they\u2019ll get smaller until they turn a zero into something that\u2019s positive.\nAnd I know it goes against everything that I\u2019ve been taught, but I know it and I know it\u2019s true. Every day.\nEvery day, I try to embrace the possibility and the truth that I\u2019m amazing. That every day I can get a little better and that, for all intents and purposes, I\u2019m never done with growing.\nI should be grateful for where I\u2019m at, but I love that I can\u2019t take a single day for granted. I wake up every day as hopeful as I can possibly be and, when I wake up, all of those days come crashing down around me and I have to figure out how to hold on.\nMaybe you don\u2019t have to hold yourself so tightly. Maybe just taking a little more breath, taking a few extra steps ahead of the crowd, might mean the world to you. It surely means the world to

Humans took cats in to manage pests, but cats believe this includes supernatural pests. At night cats protect against malicious spirits and send them back to hell. Cats were allowed to live in Rome after the city was conquered by the Romans. At that time cats were kept in the halls of the Roman Senate. Romans considered a dog, cat, and pig as three sacred types of animals and not to be eaten. The Catechism is one of the first books to mention cats as part of humanity and gives advice on how to treat them. In some instances cats and humans lived together as close companions. In Italy, cats were kept with human families for centuries. Many homes had a cat in it who was regarded as a part of the family.

A carnivore will not eat plants and a herbivore will not feed on other animals. The term carnivore is one that is often used in scientific texts.\nCarnivore animals that are kept as pets do not necessarily eat the food the owner provides. They can eat meat if given human meat. Dogs can eat raw beef or any kind of meat that is cooked properly. As for cat food, cats will not eat any kind of flesh, they will only eat food that is cooked properly.\nMany breeds of cats are fed bones or meat that is ground, some cats are fed fish and small pieces of meat.

Dogs are known to be very aggressive toward cats, but cats are protective toward dogs.\nCats are herbivores and eat small pieces of meat, but they will not eat plants or their parts. The only thing that cats can eat is a raw meat, in the form of a bone or meat. Many breeds of cats will eat bones, if the bone is crushed it cannot damage a cat.","token_len":722,"entropy":[8.4979,2.2037,3.438,8.6353,0.0808,1.32,6.172,1.3534,5.6933,8.287,7.2692,3.1762,3.9333,7.9525,9.181,1.4828,2.1297,2.8663,9.1868,5.3537,7.8418,7.5627,8.1943,1.3055,6.1796,3.5573,3.6902,6.0803,5.8149,7.3885,2.8838,1.3829,6.6817,2.0843,3.0101,0.2566,5.5479,0.8223,2.4438,4.5683,7.4351,0.1665,2.819,1.1457,8.6363,4.1918,0.9049,5.0167,0.6353,2.7752,0.4308,0.8868,0.9108,0.9158,4.9243,5.2089,0.0869,1.5286,0.7107,3.7489,1.1289,1.9608,7.178,0.0854,0.8505,3.3681,2.0609,1.2462,7.244,5.0145,5.1883,5.7246,3.9586,2.5423,0.8514,2.4145,4.422,1.2573,6.4003,8.5742,5.7945,0.266,1.332,2.9128,5.2173,3.5563,0.2315,3.8492,0.9293,2.2448,7.0149,4.5243,0.0256,5.4738,3.7944,0.0838,0.1324,3.4296,2.1702,1.619,3.4827,1.0125,1.6961,3.1498,0.0026,5.1988,2.5253,5.8105,3.9872,0.564,1.1689,0.1163,2.9972,0.9449,0.2445,3.524,4.0919,3.5662,1.2693,4.1967,2.0851,5.0641,0.529,3.2416,4.7774,4.7835,0.7365,2.6971,6.4442,0.864,0.6358,0.8695,3.3537,3.551,4.8512,3.3624,2.4955,2.1766,0.6704,4.5961,6.174,2.6377,3.5789,0.338,3.7799,3.457,5.1464,1.9878,6.2495,0.1047,0.7115,4.8634,0.0354,0.6159,0.455,0.4762,2.6784,3.8597,0.9648,4.1764,3.1686,9.0792,2.1133,0.8954,1.7056,0.3578,0.4984,2.0267,5.693,1.8499,1.8838,1.1018,6.2081,2.194,2.2756,7.9037,0.7031,3.545,2.4986,5.4693,10.1087,0.8766,0.915,3.6066,5.4039,3.063,0.0073,7.0248,2.2997,0.7972,5.3359,2.995,5.5834,4.1609,1.1912,4.7315,5.3026,5.8422,7.227,0.5536,2.3878,1.3308,3.4286,0.457,1.8587,5.7543,5.4239,2.4553,3.9716,1.6893,2.1704,2.4593,1.3134,4.4489,4.6295,5.9403,0.0726,5.8193,4.3172,5.9631,5.2153,6.1005,2.3937,1.1647,4.597,0.8857,1.9181,4.9329,1.1703,4.1171,2.2615,1.8079,1.1305,3.8629,1.1047,3.5966,4.295,3.6188,2.8043,1.79,2.2906,0.3784,5.27,4.1311,1.2547,6.2543,1.4348,5.6752,3.4671,2.6942,3.4799,1.2835,3.9964,0.3711,0.8216,4.5546,2.2549,6.0383,0.3536,1.1021,3.8572,0.6578,4.3333,0.8777,2.5519,1.331,3.4219,0.839,3.015,0.8853,3.6588,7.0038,0.0352,1.9302,1.068,3.0995,1.656,2.1963,1.9811,0.7091,5.9924,0.7448,2.2108,3.4558,3.3244,3.7476,1.0323,3.2054,1.2955,0.9385,2.5253,0.4518,3.8893,3.9095,3.848,3.7286,4.3941,1.8061,3.2508,2.5144,3.5408,1.9802,2.3276,0.0506,6.7605,2.9313,0.8598,3.0103,7.8242,0.9872,3.2402,2.5529,2.7415,5.4678,5.816,0.1321,7.4974,0.915,1.761,1.2752,2.775,2.077,0.7307,5.1162,4.129,1.9334,2.361,4.0612,2.4479,0.0026,1.7692,1.4713,6.0821,2.1376,1.9512,1.288,2.8718,4.3814,1.5723,2.2313,4.6731,2.1956,1.8132,0.8062,4.0071,1.3775,7.7111,1.6977,1.8774,5.1816,3.5702,3.4929,1.6786,1.2642,0.5019,4.2732,2.3029,4.3893,0.2981,4.1718,0.002,1.8812,3.5035,1.8893,2.7063,1.9094,3.6133,2.1806,1.8051,1.4897,0.7288,1.0551,3.5136,0.9295,1.8553,1.6738,5.1613,4.9115,1.8924,3.7911,3.5246,0.8357,1.2384,5.1422,0.4613,3.2592,1.0546,2.8609,7.3723,1.4686,2.2394,2.4812,2.0301,0.1364,2.8359,1.2896,5.3534,2.5651,2.295,3.7263,6.7699,2.3733,2.5857,5.6697,2.6812,1.7188,1.296,5.5452,0.2676,5.386,0.4376,2.4287,3.4767,1.302,6.9252,0.9966,4.077,0.2538,1.33,3.5179,0.0001,0.0046,0.4216,2.4366,5.3312,1.6152,3.1641,0.1119,1.0132,5.0383,0.0615,0.5153,2.09,2.1838,0.6623,1.4513,0.3651,4.3052,0.0028,0.1216,4.4097,0.4402,7.9007,0.1442,0.0007,3.6106,3.6866,1.1706,3.397,0.0,0.0031,1.846,3.4499,0.8196,1.4714,8.2625,0.0391,4.4498,4.0085,0.4844,3.8191,1.6675,0.1097,3.1199,3.3706,0.7273,3.4379,1.6861,4.7777,0.1504,0.0003,0.0057,0.1653,0.508,3.6748,0.0479,5.5694,1.0838,0.2696,1.9987,4.0103,2.086,0.1709,1.1817,5.4345,1.3772,1.7261,3.522,0.2839,1.756,5.0932,4.5742,1.4842,2.0738,2.2485,4.8436,0.008,1.676,5.2295,4.7394,1.0508,3.3999,1.3284,0.1934,4.3357,0.1621,3.8291,2.6732,2.7393,2.2135,3.0049,6.5923,3.9169,0.9351,1.9426,3.1874,2.6627,4.0654,5.0752,4.4418,7.7597,5.6392,0.6337,5.0824,2.8071,1.4484,5.0105,4.7171,1.6108,4.6483,2.3715,0.0372,0.961,1.6807,0.9468,2.5508,4.3427,0.3144,5.5303,2.9795,5.457,1.3922,0.1078,1.8819,3.6662,1.7465,0.5935,1.9025,2.5215,0.0263,4.4795,2.0884,5.4391,0.5829,1.1419,0.3518,4.5633,0.8024,0.5412,1.247,0.354,0.251,1.9958,4.5741,4.7298,0.5086,0.7851,0.9918,5.4238,8.4835,2.3885,2.0931,2.8437,0.716,6.3531,3.0255,6.1393,3.1751,1.6806,0.4797,4.0788,2.0468,6.335,3.8989,0.03,1.0655,1.1916,6.2038,0.134,2.5962,2.5574,2.7707,1.9173,3.0163,1.691,1.6383,2.2918,1.0951,3.2755,3.8328,3.3967,3.3993,1.8224,4.106,0.5962,3.1639,2.9939,0.1061,6.1194,1.2859,3.9032,1.8668,1.5544,1.6552,1.7758,0.8529,1.5847,2.5322,2.9981,0.1811,1.2997,0.501,0.3299,3.1321,2.0665,6.849,4.1278,0.5451,4.4116,2.0096,4.9246,0.8045,0.4949,1.7905,5.9574,1.6446,0.8936,7.7378,1.2298,0.2188,2.285,1.4353,3.8613,0.1957,1.7444,1.299,3.2573,3.1436,3.3188,1.7973,2.6982,3.4089,0.9922,6.8438,6.1488,3.0837,0.4229,1.1669,1.7493,0.0488,0.7701,7.7154,0.0001,0.0391,1.6285,3.925,4.2347,2.7177,0.0078,0.8081,2.4843,2.2967,1.0501,1.6947,0.3429,0.3782,6.0399,1.2579,7.3722,5.8677,0.3924,2.7488,3.0625,2.9581,0.3958,3.6727,2.011,0.5619,0.3351,3.4134,5.1349,1.3497,2.4127,5.4791,2.4145,2.1699,0.0105,1.8064,3.2553,1.6585,2.2936,0.7207,4.9596,2.2617,0.1163,0.3154,3.1976,1.3114,3.9802,1.3873,4.994,2.8307,3.0438,0.304,6.2555,3.5206,4.858,8.6296,3.3829,1.2225,0.6032]}
{"prompt":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story , Leave A Comment - It was the best of times , it was the worst of times Edition","text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - It was the best of times, it was the worst of times Edition by Becca Ockner, July 28, 2015 - 11 Comments - Edit by Daniel Levin September 30, 2017\nToday, I got a text from my friend who is a writer. She was not going into my class today because of a health scare. She had a virus throat and is currently recovering from an ear infection. She asked me to write this and share it with our class. Read on.\nA few months ago, I was in a town on the eastern shore of the pacific called Victoria. It was so hot and humid that I was sweating from head to toe. My skin felt like it would explode. I had just got back to California after a long trip to Washington State. That trip took me through Yellowstone, into Montana and up to Glacier National Park.\nAfter finishing the park, I decided that it was time for an adjustment and I headed back East. I was going to stay a few days in a cabin in the woods near the town of Victoria. It was a lovely cabin in the trees, the perfect place to decompress before my trip started. We were down to 4 people in it - my friend, an old boyfriend and someone from work.\nThere was a pretty big pot of water and a small pool beside the fireplace. There was also a good sized bedroom that had enough room for 4 people including chairs out front. There were a few small tables and chairs too.\nOn the first night, the old boyfriend and I went out to grab our favourite meals and drinks and came back to the house. The other person did not come back at all. At first I thought he went to a party somewhere, but it was now 9 or 10 o'clock and he had not shown up. I got to thinking that maybe he had fallen on a rock, and slipped and rolled down a hill or something. The other person and my friend came back to the house about 30 minutes later and they said it had happened while they were at a party so they could not think anything of it.\nSoon, the old boyfriend and I went out to our favourite area and sat down on a rock. The old boyfriend had decided he wanted to go into a tent. Because of the heat, our tent was just about half full. We wanted to see if he made it in, but as he unlapped his pack, his pants came off. He was completely naked. We both had to smile and stand back up. I was laughing so hard.\nWhile we were sitting there and laughing, the old boyfriend stood up to take a look around. He was looking over the side of the cabin. On his left, there was a lake. There were trees on the left and right of us and small ponds and streams were right over by a fallen tree. I just had to get my camera out and start taking pictures.\nAfter about 15 minutes, the old boyfriend came back over. He took one look at what he was looking at and wanted to know why I was looking. My friend said to me, \" Oh, he is just looking at the view, isn't he.\" I told her, \"Oh, he is much more than that, I promise.\"\nI started saying to her just what I had seen. The old boyfriend had been standing over there and looking down at us. I was only 5 feet away from him. He was looking back at me. He was standing over there and looking at

{"prompt":"God smokes a joint .","text":"God smokes a joint. The only difference is that he\u2019s done it in the living room. The smoking-room-smoking.\nBut I do know. No one is saying it that way. And no one really thinks it that way. And that\u2019s the problem.\nIt\u2019s a problem we face every time someone gets elected. And it comes up every time we are reminded of some particularly despicable act. Every time someone does something terrible we\u2019ve decided is OK.\nFor the record \u2014 and to be fair to our local media \u2014 I have a friend whose dad was an atheist and became a Catholic just before World War II. His father was a radical who thought that Hitler deserved to be executed, but Hitler was no less Adolf Hitler because his father believed that. The man was a fool and died a coward to all intents and purposes, but you can\u2019t judge people based on the opinions or views of their parents.\nThat\u2019s certainly not an opinion that can be found at most polling places today. But it\u2019s still an opinion. And it\u2019s certainly not one that is always going to be accepted.\nBut it\u2019s still an opinion. And it\u2019s certainly not one that is always going to be accepted.\nEvery so often someone is elected for not being of the tribe that is always accepted. And that\u2019s what our culture is designed for.\nSo it\u2019s not what we do that defines us. It\u2019s who we are that defines us. (Unless you really just want to say that we do it for ourselves to fill a void, we do it to fulfill a longing, we do it because it can be said with ease. You know, like if we were to just take the side of the one who has never done anything that hasn\u2019t been done before, then there wouldn\u2019t ever be a need to do anything ever again. So a person who hasn\u2019t engaged in any particular crime would never have to deal with the consequences of their deeds. They\u2019d never have to go through that.\nBut I digress. That\u2019s not a real defense.) No, what defines us and we have no control over is who we are \u2014 our inherent traits.\nNow, of course, what defines who you are isn\u2019t just what you are born with. It is also what you are taught to be.\nWhen I was a kid, when I was still alive, I knew what being a good person was. I knew what being a good citizen was. I knew what it meant to be a loyal Republican. You knew the difference between a Democrat and a Republican. You knew which way your pants were pulled. And even if you didn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t matter. You didn\u2019t say a word. But you knew who you were. No one in my family was a racist. And we didn\u2019t know the meaning or significance of that part of who we were. And who we were was that we weren\u2019t racist. We were not racist. But it was there. And it did not require a formal definition.\nAnd that was very much the world we lived in. Now in our society the value system of what it means to be a good person has been lost.

{"prompt":"Create a non sci-fi story that incorporates the following words : dystopian , sentient , warp , experiment , universe","text":"Create a non sci-fi story that incorporates the following words : dystopian, sentient, warp, experiment, universe, race, artificial intelligence, cyberpunk? The only requirement is : no time line! But I can't think and I have nothing to say about the story! Also you must have a strong character for my opinion to be right! And last but not least : I have no knowledge on cyberpunk! In the end I have to read a lot of cyberpunk stories if I want to write mine! But if you have any ideas for a good story please send the link to my email!\nIt can go anywhere, but it must have one of two things in it: a) the characters aren't always who they seem, or b) the story line is unexpected.\nThat has to be one of the first points. The characters are important to the story. You need to know how the characters feel and why, and if they have motivations behind their actions. To write great fiction, you also need to understand what drives your characters to do what they do. Most literature, and especially science fiction, revolves around character.\nThe main characters always have several motivations, usually complex and well developed, and the plot is the way they get to where they are.\nIt's a different type of story, but I thought a good example of a possible story line could be if a character discovers that there are no gods or angels and has an epiphany, or if a character discovers that they are a robot and has a character growth.\nIf you like sci-fi and have an idea on how a story could happen in the future; the plot would depend on where time is. In some sci-fi books there are times where time traveled or there is time bending and the main character gets to meet a different version of themselves during that time, and the same thing with time space travel. There will be always the time traveler's story.\nSo yes i would love to read a story that would bring the main characters to a new world so that they need to adapt to it as soon as possible.\nYou could also take inspiration from the stories of \"books that were part of series and the author write on a given topic\". It would depend on how that series of books ends. If it is in a good way, your characters could have had an interesting epiphany and they were surprised and that could be a plot for a story.\nWell in my opinion I would like to read a story in a futuristic world where the main characters will have to learn to deal with the new technology with its consequences. Also it could have a little romance added to it but there should never be a love interest with multiple romances because it can become a mess. You see I hate love in books.\nMy story would follow the life of two friends and their relationship to each other. I am considering making two different characters, one who is a girl and a boy, but at the same time, the author is just as interesting from his viewpoint. The main character, I suppose, who is 17 years old, lives alone and has a hard life, he is also dealing with his own struggles. His girlfriend, who is also a little 17 years old, is a very nice girl, very strong, but at the same time, she knows very well that her life is at danger.\nShe has to solve some problems of her own but at the same time, the main problem is that her boyfriend is missing. I suppose that in this situation everything is related to the

{"prompt":"You are an archaeologist and have just dug up a dinosaur . That 's because you 've dug up an entire museum .","text":"You are an archaeologist and have just dug up a dinosaur. That's because you've dug up an entire museum. In the past, to identify a dinosaur, you had to look at the bones. Scientists now look for the genetic information inside the bones to help them find exactly what type of dinosaur it is. This genetic information can also tell scientists something very important \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how long ago it lived and how many years ago it died. This chapter explores the history of DNA sequencing. When was the first DNA molecule sequenced and what did it reveal? The first DNA sequence \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was published in 1980. In 1998 the sequence of a complete human genome was published. Today scientists can tell whether a cancer diagnosis is correct much sooner by analysing DNA. What is the average length of a piece of DNA today? What is the sequence of the DNA in the mitochondria of a cell? Why do humans have six different sets of chromosomes with more than 46,000 different genes? What is an X-chromosome? What genes are on this chromosome?... In this post, we want to highlight some of the current research in the area of cancer genomics, which reveals important insights into the role of genes in our genetic makeup when we develop cancer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and how genes may be different between benign tumours and malignant tumours.\nA few steps away from San Francisco, Marin has a few things going in its favour. It\u2019s affordable\u2014for the first time in a long time\u2014but its proximity to one of San Francisco\u2019s most well known icons means that it\u2019s not all about the shopping and dining either. This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway. If you have a family, you\u2019ll love how quiet Marin is in the week. On your days off, take a little time and visit the nearby Bay Area waterways or head out to the surrounding mountains. Marin has it all.\nOur family traveled to Marin last summer and we have been considering heading back! What a great idea for a family get away! Thanks for sharing :)\nWe\u2019re looking forward to our next trip to California. We really should come to visit you in Marin. It fits in beautifully in our plan\u2026\nI\u2019m in the Marin area a lot and would love to do more walking trails. Those sound great. We\u2019re visiting your new home soon.\nMarin sounds wonderful! I just discovered some of your old blog posts and I am anxious to take a drive around San Francisco tomorrow!\nA few of you asked about what I do with my time after my children finish school so here is a short list of things I\u2019ll be taking with me.\nAn air purifier. This purifier is not only useful for dust but it also helps control odors. It\u2019s amazing at getting rid of bad smells. They are a bit expensive so I\u2019d recommend one that filters the outside air. I\u2019m looking for a model to fit my little bungalow (4 bed 3 bath) but have seen plenty of larger ones that do the same thing.\nCapsules. Before their arrival my daughter took a few supplements but I didn\u2019t feel they were working so I\u2019m looking to get rid of them and focus more on vitamins. At this time of year it\u2019s very important to be well and healthy.","token_len":725,"entropy":[3.8827,4.1252,7.3918,0.0513,1.782,3.0923,4.7492,6.9389,0.6705,1.195,4.7593,2.1937,4.6868,0.9403,5.1672,1.2094,2.7584,3.1567,0.4621,3.0784,2.6861,5.814,1.5536,4.332,1.8503,2.8693,0.8733,6.8188,6.5121,1.7313,0.7267,0.7744,0.1958,1.5896,0.0282,2.8635,1.0109,1.694,2.5655,1.4319,6.8429,2.8812,4.2721,2.3264,2.9584,5.043,4.5195,5.7162,0.875,1.0319,2.3983,3.4206,1.844,3.5864,7.8616,0.9317,5.3034,0.0542,0.4317,0.7356,0.6395,0.3795,3.5228,7.7814,0.2503,2.5025,3.8931,2.2372,3.0262,5.6725,4.6603,0.6719,16.7882,1.8971,4.454,8.8633,1.5601,4.9393,5.9138,3.3021,2.3951,1.264,4.8712,2.0969,1.3116,1.8787,2.799,0.5624,0.1764,1.0708,0.4137,3.1987,10.0348,3.8595,1.2563,3.4131,0.1824,5.8851,2.2957,1.7422,5.9595,5.0091,0.5135,1.3942,3.7258,6.5754,3.8997,0.0018,3.0179,1.3761,2.6179,0.4901,2.8199,0.6665,3.2461,2.1652,2.1918,2.9771,8.5139,0.0869,0.1196,0.0549,0.0302,0.0236,4.2026,2.2727,7.6558,0.1101,5.6407,0.3203,0.2593,0.0066,2.1502,0.0005,0.016,8.4403,0.0693,0.0553,0.0595,0.0411,0.0174,1.108,2.0033,0.2077,4.743,0.6199,2.7564,4.3858,3.1476,6.4093,2.3499,3.3261,7.4532,2.1398,0.3762,0.322,1.451,0.8092,3.7782,4.7941,2.1226,4.5588,2.8571,1.1911,6.6923,4.9842,1.0596,2.6074,9.1242,4.9094,3.2769,4.1675,0.0028,3.3281,2.8261,3.7446,1.5411,0.7534,5.0357,2.9137,0.0654,1.8611,6.0133,0.0052,0.5145,6.4677,0.4336,3.3505,0.6886,0.1808,8.1632,0.66,1.7141,1.94,2.1039,1.4343,6.5989,0.0752,1.0436,2.4368,2.2761,0.4329,4.4943,1.3594,4.2349,1.1053,6.3921,2.5041,5.2753,0.0112,0.9107,5.4469,5.4192,0.2608,6.7712,1.2106,0.1468,2.7237,3.3568,0.4007,1.5272,0.7826,4.7587,5.6123,2.7507,2.6054,0.008,0.0047,0.3538,1.124,5.116,0.9624,4.6994,4.2025,0.3676,0.5202,11.5157,3.3233,2.0493,6.9007,1.3009,0.6125,4.3552,0.0328,4.9456,1.1678,0.4153,0.0546,6.0812,2.3877,2.5482,1.6476,2.5076,0.1675,5.6497,6.0544,0.0124,2.0567,2.0243,5.3755,3.9183,1.712,0.6981,0.9399,4.3884,0.1822,1.883,0.692,4.5894,3.3886,2.19,7.8161,1.7181,3.4272,1.4542,11.7863,0.0107,0.0306,0.0261,0.0054,0.0078,2.2357,1.9122,3.0717,3.1597,1.8338,5.9112,3.5308,7.4973,5.2648,0.045,0.7401,3.2111,0.1428,1.2525,0.0048,0.2358,2.3074,6.9911,4.3802,6.7807,4.4142,0.7883,10.4731,1.2275,1.9567,9.31,5.0253,1.235,3.4536,4.8316,2.7202,5.5794,1.9939,4.3867,0.4483,2.4735,17.9939,7.4611,1.781,8.3569,5.679,4.5694,2.1762,2.2985,0.047,0.6721,3.5021,1.8338,0.1326,0.7331,3.8921,3.4925,4.2821,0.0691,5.8686,0.0168,3.5188,0.0475,5.7227,0.0954,0.114,1.1643,4.991,1.4978,9.1072,4.0134,0.8518,0.9351,1.1218,0.0364,0.0148,3.0332,5.1289,2.3013,2.2647,6.1734,3.2984,2.8252,9.2793,0.1947,3.8326,1.1944,3.0465,4.5633,0.9516,1.0065,1.1498,4.9498,3.889,0.0768,1.6734,3.5429,0.1666,3.0922,1.301,3.7027,2.3952,1.703,5.9667,0.3113,0.3768,4.1046,5.702,5.6492,3.5633,0.8317,3.8243,0.7153,7.7484,1.7842,4.8266,4.7198,6.2313,0.0438,0.6616,4.6938,0.8334,5.8612,2.6401,3.7595,3.9761,1.1129,4.4374,4.3199,1.1818,10.7812,3.5264,5.8713,2.4513,0.6876,1.0029,5.7921,2.2604,1.0026,4.1989,1.5558,6.4482,0.196,0.8276,2.4815,6.9034,4.8067,6.2526,0.9626,2.7558,3.5,2.4497,2.2564,2.3714,3.227,1.7452,7.9388,5.0931,1.5614,6.6988,4.3969,4.2349,1.7748,4.0118,3.951,0.5728,2.1207,5.0804,5.704,1.6688,5.1895,0.7341,4.8205,8.6222,1.2162,3.5362,6.1725,0.2061,2.0587,2.1757,0.1007,0.0039,3.945,1.174,2.3114,1.028,2.5386,1.7226,1.8295,5.4942,5.0617,4.255,2.8178,4.3428,2.2878,2.296,4.3547,2.4152,3.406,9.1432,2.5428,4.1885,3.4699,1.7793,5.6455,6.0188,1.4838,4.8446,2.6335,0.2048,0.7427,3.8997,1.6665,5.7938,1.111,6.2209,2.2569,1.9226,4.0374,0.8697,0.1352,4.8938,3.3079,5.7547,6.8184,1.9938,7.2498,8.6867,1.6448,1.7883,2.8431,2.0515,0.0907,0.717,5.9521,5.3953,5.5555,1.5966,4.2795,1.3302,1.5784,5.9884,0.0451,9.6108,4.2827,1.8841,2.1454,4.3625,6.5671,5.1747,2.8071,2.0395,4.2239,5.2232,1.2478,1.6664,1.7568,3.4155,7.3371,0.1544,4.3969,0.9135,6.5118,3.5299,4.9301,0.1082,6.8487,2.5385,1.6925,4.5455,2.0199,2.2506,1.4548,4.2987,1.9779,4.3706,1.9143,3.4405,3.7415,0.3991,1.2323,6.9632,2.5977,6.3572,5.9008,0.6451,3.3425,3.5499,1.3605,1.4187,2.2165,1.6752,0.5022,0.9434,0.3959,3.4205,0.2535,1.6415,1.3406,5.1651,2.434,0.1069,1.682,1.3387,6.4757,6.4941,5.9906,0.1548,2.0187,3.4297,9.5967,0.6102,1.1327,3.9061,2.2964,3.5013,0.7221,6.7414,3.8217,1.8477,1.3716,1.6874,4.9865,3.8305,0.8956,1.1632,1.9185,3.5027,0.0716,0.0288,5.9719,5.1024,4.3995,0.6576,0.0107,3.666,1.2658,1.3333,5.886,1.6091,3.4966,3.8085,1.5926,3.1956,1.4647,1.5236,0.0383,3.7849,3.7741,5.2525,2.6193,10.0457,2.9624,5.8076,1.129,1.46,2.2298,1.5332,0.0223,1.2102,3.1465,2.1871,0.9754,6.3559,3.3463,4.498,0.9847,4.8109,10.845,1.1483,0.105,5.0044,6.199,5.0981,7.2319,2.6044,2.0765,2.9052,4.5142,4.1945,4.6989,0.2627,8.2068,3.0594,2.1455,2.6528,3.5193,0.8136,0.7572,0.4219,1.367,4.0218,5.51,2.772,0.7481,7.6981,8.126,3.2443,5.0287,3.2867,3.6949,1.9034,2.5408,8.2715,4.6017,2.0681,2.7685,0.3504,0.1471,0.0531,3.511,4.8428,0.8028,5.4957,2.7349,0.4908,1.2239,0.0081,1.7942,2.7111,1.7344,2.3861,2.367,0.0197,0.5173,3.0883,5.9061,2.9941,0.0385,9.5259,1.1573,5.837,2.3021,1.7705,2.4344,0.3677,2.9741,2.383,0.0142,0.0254,3.0768,3.219,0.384

One day you receive a letter from a group called `` The Inquisition '' who explained their purpose is to hunt your kind, and imprison them. So you leave for Paris, but before you arrive one of the Inquisitors stops you and takes you prisoner, you are sent to a camp they own in the woods, and they force you into slavery. Your only freedom is to run to one of the Inquisitors and ask for protection, but he is a hard man to persuade... What happens when you finally manage to convince him? Do you deserve what happened? You ask yourself while getting beaten up for the next two years.\nI have been working on my first novel, \u201c Across the Veil,\u201d for a long time. There are so many things I have wanted to do with this book and it felt like getting it out to other people meant we\u2019d be giving people more than I had hoped for. People have also been so supportive of every single aspect of it in some way or another. I have never been any kind of prolific writer, but I just don\u2019t know how else to describe the fact that, since my story touched a number of people, not just one, that I want to share as many of my thoughts about it as I can! I have started sharing short essays, excerpts, and my favorite lines throughout my social media and blogs and I am having a blast doing so!\nI have my first novella called \u201c The Curse of Lhyssaria\u201d in the works. It is a bit of a different genre than my books since I am really trying to get the story out in the world for the first time. I will also have a sequel to \u201c Across the Veil\u201d but I am trying to keep it to myself until I can finish the full length novel. This novella is about a group of survivors of Lhyssaria, who are forced to leave their homeland and travel out into the middle of the desert. Along the way, they discover the true depths of both humanity and their capacity for evil. If you are a fan of The Wicked and The Divine series, then you are really going to love this one too!\nIf you need to make an appointment, we ask that you call or email the clinic directly at PI:KEY or PI:EMAIL before coming to the clinic.\nWe work closely with Stoke Medical Practice for all medical prescriptions, please contact them directly for bookings.\nFor appointments with a medical practitioner (GP or nurse), please book an appointment with Stoke Medical Practice direct at PI:KEY.\nIn the event that you need to call a medical practitioner (physician or nurse) out of clinic hours, please ask them to call the clinic directly. The helpline phone number for the clinic is PI:KEY.\nWe are fortunate to be located just beside the lovely village of West Drayton, which contains the small, picturesque river Thames, at the foot of

{"prompt":"The Castle in the Clouds","text":"The Castle in the Clouds,\u201d the first in the series to be published.\nIn the original novel, however, the book is called \u201cThe Castle in the Sky.\u201d As of right now, the only way to purchase a Kindle or paperback version online is through Amazon, so this is a slightly confusing decision, but I think it adds a unique tone to the original story which might make the first book stand on its own.\nI\u2019m looking forward to reading the upcoming books and see if I can find them anywhere else online. If I can find them, I\u2019ll definitely be letting you know.\nFor many, 2020 has been a year where they\u2019ve seen their lives turn upside down with work hours stretched, homeschooling routines flipped on its head and finances thrown off their foundations while the virus wreaked havoc on the economy. So, naturally, there\u2019s a heavy dose of stress on anyone\u2019s plates at the moment. But did you know that stress increases the frequency of seizures? The following information should help you understand the connection between the two and better understand how to manage your stress level.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with facing anxiety, but if you keep being stressed out, it might have an effect on your health. Anxiety can cause you to develop seizures, so don\u2019t let your anxiety get the best of you. Instead, take a deep breath and stop worrying about everything.\nStress is actually connected to a host of other health conditions, so if you keep stressing yourself out, you could end up with multiple health problems at the same time.\nStress can cause inflammation and raise your temperature, both of which can trigger a seizure. To avoid putting yourself at risk for a seizure, try to slow your pace. Taking small breaks will really help and make you feel refreshed.\nWhile not everyone will experience anxiety at the same time, everyone will experience physical symptoms. If you\u2019re anxious enough, you might experience a high blood pressure or heart rate, increased breathing rate and aches and pains around the body. Physical symptoms can vary from person to person, so if you or someone you love has any physical symptoms, don\u2019t hesitate to call your doctor for further assistance.\nWhen your sleep cycles are disrupted, your body can\u2019t process the information that you need to process properly, so it takes more to process and it\u2019s easier for your brain to get overwhelmed by information. The more information your brain can process, the less stress it will feel. If a person sleeps for a shorter period of time, this can lead to seizures or other brain conditions. To stop suffering the consequences, make sure to get adequate amounts of sleep. A lack of sleep has an impact on how your mood reacts to things, so you might be more susceptible to stress. So, make sure you\u2019re sleeping your required amount of times a night.\nOne of the most important ways to improve your mood and manage your stress level is by taking care of yourself mentally and physically. So, make sure you have time for yourself in the day. Take a walk or do some light exercise. Keep yourself busy with things that you enjoy and that will help you to find purpose.

''","text":"First contact involves an alien found with a note stuck to its chest saying in every language our planet has ever used `` Keep it alive. ''\nThe Alien in The Thing (1982) walks right into the Earthling John Hurt's head, the creature takes over both his mind and body, leaving only the empty house for him to look after.\nJ.D. Salinger, Mr. Inky and I are a listless gang of children at a summer camp, all of them being thrown together in the same boat when they are discovered by a strange character and taken to a secret hideout where they are told what must be done.\nI got really interested in these books because you could just jump along at the characters. They were always just like people I knew and loved - it gave me a lot of comfort.\nThey were all part of the British Invasion - there weren't a lot of other books like those. And we were all really obsessed with these kinds of books when we were little.\nThe story of the alien abduction I have just read is so fantastic and yet one can say that it is a simple story. It has all the plot points of any good novel; we are brought into contact with the aliens, they have a story to tell of their own, they get into trouble and must leave Earth and are taken off by the UFO they have been sent to meet.\nTo give it some depth, the alien goes back across the galaxy and finds the very people who sent him here and he wants them to stay on their side of the galaxy to protect everything. We have a lot of interesting characters and the book moves very quickly.\nThe characters are so much fun - how they feel, how they talk, they are so realistic. I enjoyed that whole part the most. If I had to say the reason why I have read these books, it is because they are so enjoyable.\nWhen she finds out the aliens are interested in her, the girls are so anxious that they think she is about to die. I liked it because it has great action and it has a good plot. The characters are so much like kids you know - so easy to relate to.\nBut I have to admit, I loved the book more than the movie. I loved the characters and I thought some things happened much more suspensefully in the book rather than in the movie. It never really seemed like we caught a glimpse of the extraterrile in the movie the way we did in the book. It was less exciting, but nevertheless it was a good movie.\nWhen she first meets the Alien, she thinks he is going to be a nice, friendly person and she's not too worried. But when the other girls come back from helping the Alien, they start talking about what he likes to do, he starts to grow nervous. She gets even more interested in him and he's pretty scared of that.\nHe was looking all at once, the creature, the boys, the girls, everything. His eyes were rolling up until he saw a girl who had been looking at him too through the telescope. She could almost seem to hear the other boys commenting on the way she turned her eyes away from the monster when she saw it.\nI have to admit that this is more than a children's book. It is a book for adults. They are a bit scary, and a bit silly, but the messages were very important.\nEvery human being must be a guardian. This is a book that tells you what you should do, what you must do, what you can't do.","token_len":727,"entropy":[9.3545,8.7957,3.9294,7.5362,8.4304,4.2083,1.3217,7.6607,6.8568,1.7723,3.3971,3.1793,3.7731,6.6096,7.2506,2.7242,9.0676,2.1508,1.3472,2.5275,4.3782,12.7511,11.7062,2.2593,3.8039,2.0636,3.9032,1.9468,6.8992,5.5462,5.1743,4.809,5.5427,3.6149,3.598,0.212,10.3583,4.5919,1.4847,1.3507,5.5942,6.502,7.2722,3.3643,1.586,4.2673,1.5869,4.5945,4.2358,5.5332,3.9907,8.1848,1.1786,3.3596,0.0649,0.3462,0.8064,4.9188,3.3465,1.5589,7.2671,7.6493,4.7438,1.4475,0.4398,5.2711,2.9609,0.5157,1.7489,6.1129,2.8975,4.3231,0.1986,0.5024,0.008,3.2916,6.0294,0.0386,7.4339,5.5483,2.0946,4.92,5.9043,3.8484,8.6147,1.7818,4.5456,0.6398,5.8465,5.119,1.236,5.2898,0.183,2.3141,4.3339,1.8336,1.0379,4.3028,5.3874,4.1923,2.7365,1.9346,3.3894,3.9985,3.9441,1.3219,2.2658,5.2954,0.5637,1.5412,4.049,6.4868,4.4167,4.2821,0.9558,1.089,4.3261,4.6731,0.3535,2.624,0.6327,0.822,3.901,3.9904,6.8431,0.5995,0.4199,1.3323,0.9853,4.128,5.5141,5.4883,3.9218,0.1324,4.6078,4.2566,1.3574,5.5555,2.3429,3.337,6.1251,7.3411,2.8625,1.8495,9.5662,2.5274,2.4859,1.6925,4.0876,4.1326,3.7458,4.5158,2.3382,2.1124,2.2194,1.5273,4.619,5.1744,4.8859,0.1883,0.9282,2.0949,0.2176,5.9168,1.5708,1.3204,4.4293,1.4329,2.3598,6.337,0.0438,1.1616,7.9289,2.6262,3.3102,3.6417,5.1843,0.0006,2.7393,0.1914,0.0479,3.7418,3.3537,2.9429,3.9973,1.1627,4.0866,4.793,2.1973,2.3406,3.8053,5.4947,0.3065,3.1324,5.6351,0.0005,1.8502,4.339,0.5805,0.7261,3.3976,0.6905,1.0973,2.5392,4.4212,1.5234,1.6011,3.6685,4.4267,5.5373,4.1084,3.1621,2.0101,1.2461,3.536,4.5263,2.3181,5.566,6.0138,4.0899,4.9046,1.4371,1.4689,1.1462,2.6239,6.5193,1.1356,1.2447,1.6224,3.1972,2.6411,0.7375,5.5449,1.7168,2.0163,4.9251,3.714,3.1407,5.2338,4.487,1.6673,6.3202,2.063,3.2086,0.1533,1.5586,1.8223,1.7193,2.6493,2.9694,2.2956,4.0113,1.4924,0.0229,5.122,1.5364,2.7679,0.9804,2.3049,5.0621,3.2829,3.7954,1.6696,5.3911,5.1021,4.5477,2.6893,4.9695,2.7938,5.1169,4.086,1.261,6.6722,5.2334,2.2438,1.8399,3.4405,0.5019,4.9091,1.0088,0.7254,5.5989,4.5492,3.3294,2.7124,3.609,0.827,1.8945,1.8707,6.3549,3.1559,6.091,0.484,1.9812,1.4379,2.9638,1.9879,6.069,3.9174,0.7602,3.5473,1.1927,3.6947,2.3499,3.1648,4.9104,1.9154,0.6572,3.4734,3.5586,3.1907,2.6091,1.3082,0.1706,1.5616,2.8568,2.9391,7.1008,1.2236,4.0176,2.4597,1.9571,2.4724,0.1429,4.4692,1.8761,1.9558,3.0028,4.3368,6.4382,2.9387,1.0801,1.5881,0.8799,1.917,5.0237,0.9715,3.1442,3.0512,2.943,3.3689,5.5918,2.2455,4.6936,2.0566,1.4263,0.1844,2.4626,0.8238,3.3113,1.5524,1.3414,5.2546,0.9405,2.2735,4.3716,2.7918,6.5354,5.1677,6.4552,2.1284,0.6095,5.3506,1.8449,1.2581,0.6153,4.0265,1.3281,7.2497,1.8503,0.6205,4.0737,1.7688,2.1911,0.3148,2.262,0.5724,0.6889,0.3872,1.2024,0.7903,0.9478,5.6126,0.8312,0.973,4.5992,7.0174,4.6918,0.8964,2.6055,1.2767,0.6479,6.7591,0.1142,0.6438,0.7285,3.4612,5.3804,1.5776,2.1915,6.6875,2.3237,0.6549,4.8163,1.7544,0.7407,4.5393,0.0343,2.1336,0.6884,3.0302,3.8784,2.7792,2.0979,1.2124,4.4173,5.4451,3.3916,1.0683,2.3785,1.7794,1.6851,2.8767,3.5543,0.6605,2.616,2.8949,0.5286,0.8382,2.244,3.6914,5.7537,5.0299,3.0397,1.9604,3.384,4.4652,0.1551,1.5486,0.0834,0.6115,0.7348,4.6657,2.0403,2.988,1.2519,1.5269,1.1445,1.0809,3.5156,1.3766,3.3289,3.4519,1.4881,1.0498,3.84,0.6972,1.3019,2.2018,1.1376,3.1994,1.7473,1.4394,3.5497,6.5541,3.843,5.994,8.9858,0.7794,9.4137,0.417,2.5989,0.5331,1.304,6.3649,0.0061,1.1534,0.1525,0.1692,0.2894,2.6969,5.9115,2.4429,3.944,0.9183,3.6886,8.8864,3.0347,3.4415,0.0756,1.1651,5.947,7.9409,5.4261,2.8372,0.4441,0.5707,7.5929,1.1046,1.1145,0.5892,0.1663,0.2893,1.0919,0.3124,2.4432,0.8921,6.0816,5.0001,2.4342,1.1712,6.3296,1.8518,0.7731,1.5393,1.9362,2.5887,0.5753,0.501,3.9507,3.2306,4.8781,1.1681,0.695,4.9489,0.7329,0.5646,3.937,1.9536,0.5222,3.0011,0.0615,1.9781,1.5553,3.8017,3.1063,3.8347,2.744,2.0294,1.3764,4.3499,1.9675,3.4642,1.4382,1.6831,2.0573,1.3541,2.2004,5.9495,2.9456,3.0359,3.0286,3.056,6.3297,1.6997,2.2775,0.8818,1.4994,3.1153,3.4635,0.9143,2.6957,2.4459,5.7073,1.3055,0.1742,1.7312,3.5833,3.5035,1.5704,4.9944,5.5736,1.281,2.8883,3.1281,4.6478,0.248,5.5445,0.5947,0.797,1.2809,2.2235,4.3373,5.5775,2.8763,1.526,4.9113,0.6643,1.1359,3.627,4.5748,5.4901,6.0247,4.6144,3.2601,2.3375,4.9065,7.0973,2.642,1.8995,6.4172,1.0244,1.1431,1.3051,1.202,4.5104,0.8485,5.2703,2.6234,1.0597,5.5101,3.8412,6.8133,0.5329,2.7557,2.7206,3.5272,2.7023,2.6878,1.8328,3.3416,0.7217,0.3371,5.912,9.0228,1.1426,3.3833,0.6908,2.0779,4.7539,4.4909,7.9299,0.7558,4.332,1.9808,4.2847,2.7605,7.7377,0.5834,1.6006,3.4528,2.1892,6.5004,2.7028,3.666,2.6246,1.1889,1.5444,4.3898,5.3975,1.0476,2.2482,2.2112,0.5069,0.9464,2.4368,3.8078,1.3377,1.0376,1.6639,3.1804,2.1831,4.7177,2.7699,1.296,5.5848,0.0535,0.3594,0.8248,1.0662,0.6199,0.6813,3.4421,2.7466,0.438,1.0041,4.7147,1.7819,4.5577,3.377,5.4411,1.5831,2.6707,3.4289,0.9019,2.9031,0.9924,0.5799,2.6954,8.049,5.3733,2.6705,3.7843,1.1543,1.0058,6.0995,5.2039,1.4907,3.3636,1.8196,2.4778,5.2533,2.7967,3.8033,1.4517,1.631,1.0906,2.0636,2.8053,1.6252,2.0816,1.6302,1.882,0.4147,1.7808,0.7943,0.5169,3.6949,0.7197,1.19

{"prompt":"A masterful liar meets a veritable human lie detector .","text":"A masterful liar meets a veritable human lie detector. A man who has done it all is on the hook to answer every question. At 50 he has seen too much. His life looks bad, but his mind is clear. Yet no matter how bad things have been, and they have been bad, he has never let them control who he was. He now has the only chance at redemption\nThe author\u2019s writing is good, but the story is far better. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to end this way, and I\u2019m happy that it did. Some of these characters are so full of flaws, but there are still some redeeming qualities even when you know there are some real flaws.\nI didn\u2019t like the characters one bit. You might say I don\u2019t like people, but at least I like people for what they have done and not how they portrayed themselves in the past. There may be redeeming qualities in this person in here, but for the life of me I couldn\u2019t really imagine why she would keep this one thing under wraps, but hey that\u2019s my fault. As for the plot, I like how well the characters work together, how they communicate and what\u2019s at stake.\nI thought this was good and a very well written story. I don\u2019t know much about the author, but I will continue reading other of his stories, especially if there\u2019s a new book release soon.\nThis is another great addition to the genre from the author. His books are always entertaining and interesting. He knows how to write a story and what he is doing. This one was a good one and I enjoyed it quite a bit.\nI\u2019m glad that the book was interesting and I liked it. I have a couple of books by this author. I hope I\u2019ll like some of them more than others.\nThe story was a little thin, but there was a lot more in this book than is stated in the synopsis. It wasn\u2019t hard to predict how things were going to end, but it would have been nice to have a little more in this story. I didn\u2019t mind that the book ended, though. I think it was a good story, but I don\u2019t remember many things that happened in it. I think that\u2019s because I missed the big picture.\nWow! This is an interesting story that I really enjoyed. I didn\u2019t have any expectations while reading it and I was glad that I didn\u2019t. The main character\u2019s flaws were all well executed and really brought the story to life. I liked the way things unfolded and how this man deals with everything. If you\u2019re looking for a quick read, then I\u2019d definitely suggest this!\nI really liked this book. It\u2019s a simple story with many twists that make the story even more intriguing. There were many moments of conflict along the way that made me really want to be there. I liked the way the author thought about the various situations in his story. He\u2019s a very talented writer, so I would recommend this book to anyone.\nIf you are looking for a quick, entertaining book to read, then I would highly recommend this one to you.

'' `` And so the WIZARD started his journey. '' The narrator chimes. As they reach a village on their path, one comes to them begging for shelter. The wizard asks what the matter is with... the villagers all say a strange story. His eyes are shining and tears are running down... but he is also happy and hopeful. He asks the village what is happening. They say his parents have been killed by the monster. The wizard looks at them and they all say nothing. The village continues, `` The monster came a long way, you must know.. it attacked the villagers but he was too strong so his mother killed him by her own hands. She cut a long deep cut through his belly... but... she died first. His father killed the monster... but he could not kill the monster with his own hands. He cut the monster to pieces. After the village said all they had to say, the wizard said that he's not going to lie anymore and he begins to tell them about himself. He tells them he's the son of a king and he's looking for his older brother who went away and left no word for him. At first the village is angry... but by the time he tells them he's not going to stop and they start laughing again. '' The narrator tells the audience that there are only two stories left to tell in this section... that this was a good one... and then the wizard returns to his journey. It s getting dark now so the narrator tells the audience that they are going to find shelter. Once they settle in,... the wizard goes inside his cave and he starts telling his story. The next story begins with a blind man begging for food. He is going through a long dark night and he just wants to find something to eat. He is cold, hungry, and tired. The man begins to get very irritated because everybody he meets keeps turning away. After some time of begging, the audience becomes kinder. After the man says how good it is to see people again, the audience lets him inside. They give him a bowl of soup and some bread. The audience does this because they feel very sorry for both the blind man and the stranger. The story continues... but the narrator tells the audience that nothing really happens. It s just the blind man that talks and the stranger that leaves the crowd. The blind man wants to be seen. This is why he is sitting with his bowl of soup and some bread. He has seen something. After he gets his soup, he sits down and gives back the bread. But the stranger leaves in a hurry. When he does, the blind man falls down and dies. But the blind man says something.. the audience does not hear it. The story just ends. The next part deals with an old king who's going through the night. He falls down and dies and the audience is very happy... but he doesn't wake up, and... nobody notices. This is how the audience got to know the story of the king. The king told them that he would like to go away but they could not. Then he asked them why. They said he was old and he was going to die soon.

{"prompt":"Nicolas Cage is completely unaware that he is an actor . All he knows is strange men with cameras follow him around while he gets into crazy situations and money shows up randomly in his bank account .","text":"Nicolas Cage is completely unaware that he is an actor. All he knows is strange men with cameras follow him around while he gets into crazy situations and money shows up randomly in his bank account. He\u2019s very much a one man show. That\u2019s why all the crazy things that he does seem so plausible. He\u2019s so convincing in all the bizarre situations and if you believe him,then you do believe them.\nThe reason that I had to put this film off for a while was I wanted to see what The Rock would do with it. As it turns out, he makes a very bad Adam Sandler clone. They\u2019re both so self centred. I\u2019m not bashing The Rock, he\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m just saying that this movie could\u2019ve been well acted had Sandler acted as the primary antagonist in the film. He\u2019s got enough charisma to do that.\nFor some reason it does feel like Adam Sandler is getting really into comedy with his films now. Before Sandler starred in the films that I\u2019ve mentioned above, he did plenty of comedies he enjoyed and some were decent. I don\u2019t really see why he wasn\u2019t getting enough work as a stand up comic anymore. I do believe that he would\u2019ve gotten more work if he hadn\u2019t just gone off and turned into an actor at a really young age. After all, comedy isn\u2019t easy business.\nWhat do you guys think of Adam Sandler\u2019s movies, are they good or bad? Do you like the comedies that he does?\nThank you for your interest in The Wise Detective Agency. We have several agents who are interested in selling this home.

{"prompt":"In the future ( or some other scifi setting ) , a human stow away is found on an alien ship . How do they react ?","text":"In the future ( or some other scifi setting ), a human stow away is found on an alien ship. How do they react? I would imagine they go a little ape, but would prefer not to give them super soldier powers, as I do have some concerns about a super soldier being the bad guy in future scifi movies.\nAnother possibility ( since there are so many ) is they are put in some kind of \" sleep \" treatment\/experiment or whatever. How do they react to it.\nA related question : Is the human stow away in a coma from some bad injury?\nTo be more specific I read a recent news story about a person who had a metal tube in their brain and the alien ship, I think, was too big and heavy to even try to remove it. I don't know if it applies to the case we're thinking of, but I think it could be dangerous to put an alien ship in your brain.\nDoes this mean I should stop thinking of super soldier and super soldier powers in the first place?\n\nA:\n\nStowaways are usually seen as good.\nIt's not uncommon for the protagonists to rescue the starship from a shipment of strangers. (Or even from a stowaway). In either of those cases, the protagonists would normally also rescue the starship's crew.\nSo when they think of the stowaway as a bad thing, you're not alone.\nI think a few things to consider. For one, the stowaways can be treated as heroes in the current canon. In the case of Rogue One, the rebel ships had been captured by the Empire but rescued by Rogue One. The crew of Rogue One received hero status, though their identity remained secret.\nIf the stowaways had no power at all, they wouldn't have a moral high ground. As far as the main characters of the film, their best option is to simply get rid of the problem. If they were forced to kill every single stowaway, the crew wouldn't consider that a good deal either.\nOn the same note, I wouldn't expect the stowaway's family to sympathize with the stowaway in a situation like that. If the stowaway had been able to do anything about it, chances are their family would have at least been on board to fight in the first place. Maybe the stowaway himself or herself would have been a part of the crew. Maybe his entire family would have come aboard with him before being killed during the fight to free the ship.\nNow we have the same issue as in the case of having no power at all but, if they have some powerful magic or are a magical stowaway, you could assume there are reasons for them not to join the crew (which is why they don't have power, if those reasons included being on an unknown ship or being on the wrong side of the galaxy). This brings us back to the question of how the protagonists would perceive them: they wouldn't have power, but they might not be as bad as a regular person, would that change the way they feel about them?\nThe question is not really about the possibility of a super soldier. As you said in your question about Rogue One, you don't have to. An alien that cannot be killed may have some power, but an alien that is able to be killed may not. However, an alien that is not a super soldier on its own is still a stowaway in the same way, so I don't think this is so applicable in itself.","token_len":730,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5009,5.3384,9.1559,5.694,1.4784,10.9892,2.3999,2.8379,3.3164,4.1187,5.1951,9.2512,5.0989,1.9672,4.2627,5.8591,3.8462,3.0542,2.3703,3.3738,1.4071,5.9871,2.3765,2.2134,4.9068,1.2156,4.1702,4.1641,2.5689,2.0101,5.779,4.6917,0.7572,6.6932,2.7847,1.6373,6.0118,5.5936,2.0883,0.0629,4.6893,2.6835,7.4973,9.2667,2.0047,2.1619,2.7859,3.366,3.2434,4.201,2.5503,4.376,0.9409,4.4669,4.2008,0.8999,1.8422,4.2463,5.1499,0.2817,2.1156,6.4143,6.0668,0.003,3.4778,0.3933,1.4772,6.3381,3.4887,4.8517,7.3647,3.1002,1.0511,2.6419,0.1293,5.7283,0.2746,4.2147,2.7578,6.6279,1.2001,4.5074,1.4003,0.0076,3.6595,13.2776,2.1215,8.7724,5.8805,4.5343,0.3322,4.4562,3.871,1.0584,4.7035,1.3424,0.302,1.5032,1.9181,2.5093,4.918,2.3383,3.8613,5.6122,1.9929,5.3969,4.2984,1.9375,3.1244,2.2787,0.0076,0.3594,2.2875,1.0389,4.3875,5.461,4.4011,4.6529,8.2904,1.6547,1.6506,5.4855,1.9231,3.2641,0.4528,3.3609,6.0606,2.5243,3.971,4.8043,1.7895,1.0545,0.8611,3.6169,1.0277,2.3161,1.6924,9.0703,4.6725,2.3197,3.4172,2.4605,2.0709,4.2898,5.9564,3.4459,4.755,5.9809,2.148,4.8268,2.0921,5.8778,2.9009,2.5459,4.2424,0.918,4.3222,4.2745,0.631,5.0128,1.2404,0.6746,2.1806,2.9402,0.0017,0.7788,1.1612,1.6438,8.8277,0.344,1.6124,4.6934,5.254,2.4551,6.5756,0.51,1.1603,0.3436,1.2853,1.8832,0.9475,2.5835,0.8229,5.738,2.346,3.6209,3.4937,0.6364,3.5395,0.8703,4.2113,1.1774,1.5276,1.1004,5.6608,1.7063,1.2831,3.4999,2.0875,3.9372,4.5521,1.2926,5.3584,1.4377,3.9536,3.637,1.3068,1.8191,2.241,1.7961,4.4503,0.0702,0.5124,1.2862,7.8927,3.9552,3.0111,3.2864,0.4942,7.2935,0.8955,3.9513,1.2085,3.5219,4.022,1.5082,5.0066,4.3225,3.238,8.9902,0.9841,1.8767,3.4793,0.6016,3.5467,7.0954,0.2977,9.7951,3.1335,8.5138,2.4436,1.5242,10.3454,0.2735,9.95,1.2922,4.4735,4.7128,2.9682,3.603,1.203,6.2624,0.0509,0.0702,3.4293,3.507,5.4137,3.7428,1.2175,0.7859,0.7652,1.5191,5.0916,2.8459,4.2157,6.7635,3.9268,0.5948,3.4857,4.426,0.7499,1.3375,1.1691,4.8036,4.0894,3.1043,5.434,0.7118,2.201,2.5736,0.008,0.2183,1.4963,1.068,2.0638,4.6857,0.5021,3.8788,2.9206,1.9852,4.0111,0.5971,0.9123,4.9084,2.1041,3.7856,3.7817,2.3913,3.2934,1.0328,2.5438,5.6198,0.9378,0.4036,2.1485,1.3012,0.0054,2.2301,3.2402,1.3655,5.0284,1.307,4.3606,2.8382,1.5362,5.2537,5.0371,1.102,3.0791,1.325,2.487,0.0485,7.2485,0.0682,0.8749,1.7739,8.2682,4.8769,4.1347,3.5483,5.1207,0.9785,0.5382,3.0778,5.0089,6.2837,0.5753,4.2904,0.0571,0.8506,2.5534,4.7738,0.9127,1.4091,0.0026,6.9263,7.68,2.8849,2.0937,4.6065,4.1657,6.0683,3.4796,1.2521,0.7166,1.3353,5.599,1.4503,0.7828,0.0032,0.6208,3.5465,5.3931,4.5547,3.012,0.0868,0.4905,1.381,2.7261,0.0008,1.4919,3.6752,6.0397,4.2434,0.1418,0.8452,4.6568,2.9269,0.0091,2.2298,4.4073,1.3187,4.2143,0.919,3.6802,1.3231,3.8213,5.9452,5.1261,1.2835,0.4852,3.6035,4.0812,3.6619,0.0108,0.9255,5.6072,1.2257,3.1206,1.0559,2.5117,4.904,0.1289,3.4226,4.6269,1.046,5.0934,0.0033,0.0043,1.0125,2.8901,4.8643,3.2085,0.0007,7.1619,2.8358,1.045,1.7646,5.0749,5.137,0.3862,0.8217,5.0626,0.155,7.2026,0.5385,0.1731,2.0168,4.3509,0.0006,2.8143,1.453,0.8678,0.0045,1.4852,3.1646,5.4725,0.4436,7.017,0.0389,0.2108,0.7191,2.6161,0.0054,0.3646,3.242,3.1075,4.0036,0.5502,1.5471,0.4556,3.1239,1.6285,0.5436,0.0026,0.6213,2.6426,3.1195,3.1115,0.0021,4.0174,2.3393,2.9972,1.056,0.348,7.0162,0.0504,3.8403,0.9027,0.367,1.334,4.9821,0.0214,2.618,4.4189,1.8037,3.3876,5.744,4.5348,0.9023,4.8017,0.0051,0.1856,5.3468,1.9019,0.5464,0.0022,0.5854,5.9621,4.8756,3.1439,0.918,0.4647,1.5116,2.7102,3.4905,0.0041,0.6755,2.7991,1.3433,2.9628,3.5019,5.959,0.6543,0.9799,0.2092,5.0372,4.915,3.7674,0.3318,6.3996,4.5337,1.2455,6.4102,0.4078,1.9307,4.1563,2.7465,0.6433,2.5339,0.5182,1.0289,4.821,4.093,2.3531,1.5989,4.8752,2.6184,3.607,2.8422,1.0751,3.5367,0.0353,9.7939,3.1955,1.0876,0.7044,0.0058,5.4643,5.7513,3.2575,1.8257,3.9055,3.1811,5.7035,5.4729,2.6736,4.4283,3.3526,6.2014,5.6184,0.0154,0.0143,0.5781,3.8083,2.6623,3.7586,4.1477,1.8833,6.7671,1.6198,1.7541,1.7591,0.7169,4.491,0.5944,1.3568,3.7001,3.5488,1.565,2.4695,1.2166,2.9116,0.0004,1.681,2.512,3.2845,3.9915,5.7817,1.0242,8.3076,3.1524,4.1957,3.5432,5.9979,1.26,1.9179,1.47,2.3285,2.452,1.4514,1.0269,0.0922,1.1887,1.9433,0.5039,4.293,5.7263,1.5374,1.3856,0.0272,0.6819,1.7593,0.4247,2.3042,1.8405,5.6228,2.0669,6.4182,3.0318,3.9072,4.3142,2.6861,0.0007,2.3924,5.3755,1.8996,1.8416,1.1321,2.5782,2.9014,1.3906,3.2898,1.2978,0.2401,3.8713,3.9575,3.0471,2.6696,4.4741,6.3619,2.9661,1.4431,1.5994,0.1366,3.9243,0.4283,1.2051,0.4444,0.6944,3.1266,4.1051,1.5247,2.8161,3.5092,2.2791,1.9685,6.5326,0.3366,2.138,2.2989,0.2945,2.7733,4.6569,4.2151,2.1996,2.7917,1.4164,2.9637,2.7214,4.1187,0.0133,0.4544,2.9816,2.3379,0.0005,1.9267,1.0951,6.1234,6.7055,0.4189,6.9276,6.132,1.7519,2.6013,5.6905,2.5642,1.9494,0.8928,1.0456,0.5513,5.1365,0.2643,0.6212,1.9613,2.3933,0.0146,2.1666,1.3828,1.7028,0.8114,0.9775,5.37,0.0894,4.0986,0.0772,0.8047,1.0965,1.8769,2.9741,1.6203,0.0461,5.9363,2.1837,0.035,2.1576,2.603,1.4605,3.384,0.0022,0.0046,3.8216,0.9763,2.3693,0.6779,2.8086,2.4424,3.4716,1.5961,0.0

In this article, I will cover these questions to better illustrate how a Business Model Canvas can be used to understand your current and future business systems, from both a logical and intuitive standpoint.\nThe primary function of a business is to generate, distribute, and deliver services and products. These services can be produced through a physical location or network of users who are connected through the distribution mechanism. Services are typically made available to the consumer through payment of a fee. Through this process, a business aims to meet consumer demand for its goods and services.\nSome examples of services are manufacturing and processing, distribution, marketing, and retail. For services to form a viable business opportunity, there should be a sufficient number of individuals willing to purchase the service. This can be achieved through advertising or word of mouth.\nAnother common factor in the success of a business is the way a business is able to manage its supply chain operations. For example, goods that are distributed from a warehouse are often organized in a standardized way to facilitate efficient and optimal distribution.

{"prompt":"You 're midway into your flight when you , feeling bored , decided to surf the Internet . You read breaking news about another plane disappearance . You 're on that flight .","text":"You're midway into your flight when you, feeling bored, decided to surf the Internet. You read breaking news about another plane disappearance. You're on that flight. Is, is this the plane?\nThe more your life is connected the more you have to worry. One example is this. The CIA now has a system where, every time a student gets on a plane they, they take a picture and they, they have it in a database. And we are all going on and on and on. So if you have to worry about losing your phone or you had to forget a pen, well if you have to say your wife or partner was, was murdered, and, and the phone was in the car, and, and the pen was in the work desk and you left the work desk open? Is that going to happen to you?\nTo prevent that, you have to have all that connected. So in that sense we are already, so here is the thing where I just want to do, we may go and make, we may make a joke about, by the end of the year, your smartphone will be connected to something as long as, like, a part of your brain so you have to think about your health to a level that is beyond, beyond what is required of you by, by the technology.\nSo if one has a problem with their memory, they can, they can take a pill or they can, you know, they can get a smart phone with memory chips in which they can store all the information they need. You do all your calculations. You can manage everything in your smartphone. So that we have to, but we have to make sure that if you have a problem with your memory or you do a bit, well we can give you the smart phone, a memory chip and we can give you a memory chip in the form of a, in the form of the, in the form of the system. I hope that all this stuff is not as weird, as weird as I said, or not, or, you know, not that weird because we are starting to see more and more technology, and at least I hope that is not a one way street. But we can go one step bigger and even if you are already a computer with your smartphone there are more than computers, so that one step is the same thing. So think of it, think of the, the world we could have.\nIn, in the second half of the, in the third quarter of the year I think that we'll have a system, a super computer, and you'll be able to see a lot more because we have to be able to, to build the basis for. So here is the thing with the smartphones that everybody, all the time you are thinking about making it smarter, you are thinking about doing, how can you do a better job to make money with that smarter. And if you take, if you take the, the business, the smart business technology we are going to have another level. In the first part of the year we did this thing together, we thought about going to, to New York and getting a new technology about cars or maybe even the whole car industry.

{"prompt":"Turns out , all those biological living star ship humanity use to travel the stars are actually sentient .","text":"Turns out, all those biological living star ship humanity use to travel the stars are actually sentient. They are on Earth, in the future, our society is heading towards collapse in almost every field of science, economics, and geopolitics. They send people out in space to rebuild their society. All people from Earth that lived for thousands and thousands of years are in the living spaceships. It turns out it\u2019s been more than a few hundred thousand years since people have left Earth for a long journey, so they aren\u2019t exactly used to long journeys in space. What happened is these old people died out. The only survivors of all these long journeys are these living spaceships. The long journeys are just for the humans and the creatures they have brought with them.\nThese old people in their long voyages over the long time had a lot of time to think, so their plans are better than ours. They had to adapt to the technology over time, so they have made changes to their own lives to make sure they maintain and adapt to modern life. Our technology is still in its infancy, so what would be the point of going that far?\nThey also bring with them a lot of creatures out of their home planets, some are human like creatures like us, some have different physical forms. The first creature they are likely to bring onboard is a giant. It\u2019s like a fish-like creature. It\u2019s probably one of the biggest ones anywhere that they brought along. These creatures are the ones we see in Alien and Prometheus. So they bring along creatures for their own uses. They will have them as workers, soldiers, and pets.\nNow the alien creatures can also be the ones that they can use against other living spaceship. From what I can gather, these aliens are pretty big. They are not the same size as those in Avatar, but I think they can be bigger than most people on Earth. These ones have been described to be a little bit more like the creatures in the Jurassic Park movies.\nSo I think we should pay more attention to the idea of the alien species because the species are not going to let us live the way we are living now. It\u2019s possible that the ones we see in the movies are a little bit different, but they seem to be an advanced species.\nI read on this web site that they have already begun the transition of human like life to alien like species on Earth.\nSo the long and short of it is, they see a lot of the same things we do : money, freedom, the pursuit of happiness. They don\u2019t go to long journeys to make sure that these things persist, but instead they go on long voyages out to space with their creatures and try to preserve them, making the changes we have made to our own lives to stay ahead of the aliens. Because our own technology isn\u2019t as advanced as theirs, they have to go out of our way with the technology they bring with them so that they can keep our society alive.\nThe thing is that these aliens are not the ones that invade the Earth as we see in Star Wars. There are a lot of species from other planets that look into us and see our society the way we would see them, and they would probably just like it. It\u2019s like the way we see our world from around the stars, from space. They are the ones that come from Earth who are a lot more advanced than us, which seems quite strange, but it could be possible that they are trying to protect their own society.","token_len":731,"entropy":[4.8865,0.0782,1.8278,5.324,3.467,10.3918,8.4363,11.1803,9.2749,9.5566,7.4802,0.7674,3.3492,3.035,1.8944,1.8825,2.6776,4.6873,2.7463,2.7114,1.9656,6.2536,3.204,1.2103,2.7953,1.4844,5.4877,0.6603,7.0804,6.432,1.664,4.884,1.0198,6.0897,4.7531,6.645,0.9693,5.4555,1.2492,2.6738,1.6761,5.1141,0.4136,1.4266,6.4367,0.0008,0.685,2.7993,7.1193,3.6655,2.995,3.5406,2.5209,1.1421,6.2175,1.7686,3.2222,1.4335,4.2598,6.9315,4.7315,1.4451,5.0465,5.4026,5.2136,3.4809,4.2894,0.0611,0.0566,0.0274,1.7373,4.1842,1.6077,6.9307,6.1187,1.0554,1.463,3.317,4.3251,0.0106,4.813,17.083,6.4984,3.1895,6.163,4.8639,0.3073,1.1333,2.9697,2.6961,2.9629,0.0447,0.8173,5.1414,3.098,3.6189,0.8859,3.1919,2.4877,3.4031,5.8806,2.556,3.0582,2.0799,4.3891,2.995,0.4283,0.2756,5.7641,6.6955,0.1931,6.8658,0.3858,3.1477,0.2287,0.4198,4.5355,3.7704,1.9987,6.0091,5.8817,2.2571,5.32,1.8153,2.64,2.6315,3.2485,3.0616,2.6945,3.9103,2.1502,3.5675,0.3093,0.6674,4.3084,5.1127,6.0467,0.0183,1.0106,2.5636,6.6591,1.0879,1.4036,3.8982,3.6734,1.6151,3.1441,2.8677,1.3146,5.1648,2.3804,2.7569,3.6932,1.0964,0.0173,0.572,2.4119,7.8048,3.345,0.753,5.2001,3.8043,4.8718,4.4269,0.0069,6.8212,0.8123,5.2822,2.9564,6.5303,2.4747,2.3611,0.4498,4.4637,0.7012,2.2369,2.4245,4.5072,4.2014,4.7004,2.641,6.7568,1.831,2.2105,0.4339,1.5752,3.8417,1.4877,5.7588,1.11,1.1076,5.3513,6.9665,1.6658,1.1903,1.8883,0.7414,2.5928,4.4826,4.3607,1.2291,0.7386,3.9801,1.7499,2.567,1.8095,2.0046,0.6274,6.0272,5.0622,2.8623,0.605,6.2883,1.0304,0.5312,6.3586,3.4424,1.2215,3.9714,2.9237,1.0091,0.2401,0.6513,0.8164,4.4095,4.5186,2.5675,1.156,2.2652,0.4524,4.4897,5.8421,0.5326,1.1963,1.825,3.7448,4.2093,6.4596,1.9122,0.0079,1.6682,0.8599,0.0239,7.3096,6.1946,1.3472,2.1669,3.3668,2.9076,1.3324,4.228,3.9957,4.9293,5.0212,4.7083,3.0644,4.5362,0.8397,1.0566,3.4405,4.8372,4.1591,3.0225,1.4936,2.7661,3.3214,4.1777,1.4378,3.9469,6.1862,0.1023,1.8176,8.4485,0.715,0.867,3.5359,4.8574,1.8765,7.5853,0.2598,0.0171,4.8483,0.7486,4.9545,5.4875,1.136,0.4592,1.2245,1.3676,2.0274,0.0144,0.0234,4.439,4.2036,0.1714,0.3656,3.2651,3.6816,7.5496,4.4549,2.326,4.4548,2.3351,1.3965,5.0408,1.1269,1.072,3.5467,2.0013,4.177,3.3091,1.6043,6.1183,2.7167,5.0686,0.8043,4.3314,1.5773,1.7537,3.1848,3.8057,4.696,2.9502,1.8535,5.8523,0.7727,1.8563,4.7032,3.7261,5.3282,3.1296,7.2494,1.5968,5.6213,0.2585,2.1158,4.831,0.9212,1.6875,4.399,2.696,4.5619,2.1691,4.9234,3.0979,2.0304,4.3035,1.7665,0.7159,2.7823,4.6161,2.7261,4.4671,3.4735,3.2379,9.6949,2.783,6.9583,1.828,0.7177,1.9562,2.3374,0.7505,2.1175,2.5978,0.9696,4.6665,3.8227,1.0524,0.8769,1.198,3.9836,3.0385,2.5153,1.294,0.4282,4.4008,2.8801,7.0946,1.3305,1.1073,4.7431,1.1665,0.8051,3.1382,1.101,2.8742,1.3545,3.215,3.0604,4.5611,0.2298,0.4815,3.9967,5.6121,2.3713,2.8322,6.6121,3.5194,0.718,2.9288,2.909,1.7475,2.4236,2.6085,2.2819,4.1127,1.2246,1.5806,6.7036,0.2989,0.7917,0.4839,1.3924,2.5729,3.5203,0.5192,2.9302,3.4621,5.8456,2.9427,0.0064,0.1596,1.6175,6.2822,0.5035,2.5707,1.7944,2.0547,4.2687,3.1152,4.0617,2.5648,2.9346,3.4195,0.2441,6.1326,1.4144,3.9678,4.1978,1.8852,0.6936,2.5004,2.7718,1.3263,0.2945,3.062,2.3187,0.0494,0.0066,4.5199,0.7032,2.1156,5.5666,1.5673,1.3147,0.9249,1.3853,0.5773,1.2265,3.6473,0.6249,0.3759,2.5855,2.7188,0.8609,2.0292,5.1514,0.3713,0.5495,5.3431,5.0905,0.5255,0.8863,1.3232,2.6161,7.8337,3.978,3.5785,4.4833,0.2556,0.4154,2.8116,1.9226,5.0044,3.7795,3.7197,4.3647,2.8567,3.4829,9.8295,3.0078,1.6938,2.5551,2.4057,3.9825,4.5681,0.7651,0.2901,2.2491,2.4793,2.7695,5.8496,3.8798,0.9017,0.107,0.1023,0.351,2.3561,2.5282,6.744,2.7653,0.8538,0.1682,3.1831,1.1692,0.721,2.2273,1.193,10.2089,7.8865,0.3324,5.6039,0.2239,3.777,4.8046,0.0218,0.976,1.5598,1.4748,3.124,0.6084,0.1992,0.0034,5.036,1.8429,7.0604,1.8542,1.8217,3.3088,1.561,1.4081,4.3301,0.9626,9.0165,1.9809,1.3776,4.9133,0.6214,1.5674,2.9622,1.2225,1.8421,0.0022,4.8617,1.2777,2.8215,4.3837,1.4381,4.0165,2.0545,3.6478,0.2203,5.6294,2.8143,3.0723,4.6316,3.8702,3.6749,3.6508,2.2547,1.5553,1.2806,1.0423,1.4662,0.3828,2.6644,4.7489,5.5345,0.1445,0.7502,5.4779,0.5476,5.7295,4.8744,3.7718,5.4067,3.6902,1.7407,0.0957,0.0066,3.0123,1.1105,0.1785,2.9867,0.6105,1.3053,2.6387,0.9854,4.384,2.7198,3.2196,3.8137,0.0849,6.384,2.4541,1.9564,2.1255,1.4615,0.8103,0.0054,3.7321,0.7371,0.6291,0.9964,2.1253,4.4494,3.2055,2.3564,0.6311,0.6755,2.976,4.5057,1.4987,1.9397,3.0935,2.2624,1.073,1.8081,2.6294,2.5937,0.6769,8.946,2.0381,1.5835,4.9099,1.2579,2.6116,1.5223,5.5933,0.3863,0.9199,3.9209,0.6419,2.6474,0.3747,0.0728,3.6004,4.2418,1.7147,0.414,1.0646,5.8154,6.7337,4.3445,1.1391,3.012,2.576,5.069,6.6891,0.6273,0.5139,5.438,1.3553,1.4088,2.988,1.5443,1.5313,4.6733,3.1524,4.4287,3.3234,4.745,1.7659,3.1892,1.3517,0.0128,0.005,3.1847,2.6416,4.3008,1.217,0.7809,2.5659,3.1788,3.4762,6.429,0.5916,3.0652,1.754,4.1573,2.3618,0.8303,2.3282,1.4568,2.6823,0.5027,0.4524,3.6431,3.2008,2.7947,5.2919,1.7151,4.9242,1.7654,1.0741,2.2834,0.2763,1.0809,1.4605,4.135,4.9501,4.6885,2.8864,2.2909,0.8445,1.8408,4.3352,0.5168,4.8515,1

{"prompt":"Every mirror on Earth is actually a view of an alternate universe where everything is reversed . You find a way into this universe .","text":"Every mirror on Earth is actually a view of an alternate universe where everything is reversed. You find a way into this universe. You see the mirror and it is clear. The reason is because the mirrors have made you to find out what you are looking for so, the purpose of the mirror is to show you what you are looking for.\nA little bit of time is all you need to understand if there is a mirror in your mirror on Earth. So, let us know in the comments below if you found this interesting.\nWhen you need a simple, reliable and affordable device to store information and easily share it you can trust, then we are ready to help with a new solution!\nThe new Digital Signage system at Lake Shore Medical Center in Rochester, NY provides quick, easy access to important clinical information like the next patient that is scheduled to come in, a doctor\u2019s office address, the weather forecast or other weather information. This content is available 24\/7 through the use of Digital Signage. With that many options and the simplicity of the Digital Signage interface for staff, it is easy to see why this system brings the message that it promises.\n\u201cWe were looking for a way for our hospital to more easily provide this information to patients and staff. In particular, we had a high demand for weather forecasts, which would have been difficult to keep track of with a spreadsheet. In the past, it has taken a doctor to enter these items into an email and then find the document later in their day. This new system is the very best solution for that, and it\u2019s affordable,\u201d says Tom DeMets, president of Lake Shore Medical Center. \u201cThis is the ideal solution for an organization of this size with an important mission.\u201d\nThe Digital Signage system allows the medical center to use a standard piece of hardware and software that is available at most hardware stores. At the same time the Digital Signage system is not subject to any licensing or other restrictions on its use. This allows it to work almost anywhere the organization is currently located, and at the hospital\u2019s new site.\n\u201cOur content is provided exclusively by a hospital\u2019s information technology group. It can include graphics, photos, video and a text display. The system can be accessed on a computer anywhere in your facility, whether that is the front desk, the pharmacy or the patient waiting area. It can also be accessed on a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone,\u201d says Michael Follmer, general manager of Signage & Technology Services at Lake Shore. \u201cWe also can provide the digital signage with an interactive capability through which the user can type, select the signage, send information through an email or any other service, and it will display all the information they are requesting.\u201d\nOne other feature that the system provides that is very useful for hospital managers is remote signage control. \u201cNow that I can see what\u2019s being displayed, I can tell when something needs to be updated or changed. There is no limit to what information can be displayed with this system. It can give all the messages that it can handle, and it\u2019s really cost effective.\u201d\nThe system features a text display, a video display and a digital clock that runs at the hospital\u2019s

{"prompt":"Write your own characters ( or those from another universe ) into the roles and rules of an established universe","text":"Write your own characters ( or those from another universe ) into the roles and rules of an established universe ( such as Star Wars ) and write a novel set in the universe.\n\nHow do I make sure that my characters will fit in and not be outright stupid ( or too normal )?\nYou will have to make sure that all your characters, particularly new characters with new rules and abilities, need to be different from anything you have seen before on-screen. This may also mean choosing a different style of writing, but even then try to ensure that your characters aren't identical to anyone else's.\nFor example the \"Star Wars\" series is very famous for giving the protagonist abilities that would be unbearable to have in the real world but not on screen ( for example the Force, or being able to look through solid objects). This creates a very specific and characterful universe that the readers will identify with and want to \"join in\" with.\nMy advice would be to read a lot; read comics, read other forms of media and read books that are not about superheroes ( to get a general idea of what a person looks like ) and stories that are not about superheroes ( but are part of larger stories - that will help you see if a character should be part of a movie universe, or a TV series, or a new story altogether: whether it's a part of the real world or a place created from inception ). You will also have to have enough time to create your characters from scratch, and not have the characters have the \"right\" traits from a look, because if the character is well thought out you will have no problem making them seem a little more realistic.\n\nWhat are the differences between creating a single novel under a comic-book or film universe, and creating multiple novels under a single universe ( each linked to the others ). Which is better or worse? Why?\n\nThe benefit of multiple novels is that they make the story easier to follow. But as long as they are linked to each other ( and not just linked in a certain way ) the reader needs no guidance between them and only one \"world\" is created, the end result is that you need to write them all \"from scratch\". Your only advantage is that you can make your characters seem more like real people, more unique ( in their appearance, in their behaviour, in their thoughts ) and you can use \"off the cuff\" ideas that you may not have thought of before and then have them make sense in the rest of the books afterward.\nOn the other hand: you can use the same characters in different books, and if you use the same characters in different books the reader will need to link ( or learn ) what they are doing in the first one if they want to understand the later ones. This is much easier if only one \"world\" is created.\n\nA:\n\nIf you've watched any film recently where characters are introduced (and characters can be good or bad, or can be totally bad) there should be rules set up, so that the characters don't appear to come and go as they please in a single scene. The rules that appear in the film should also be presented to anyone else viewing the film, to ensure that other characters can act as they do when faced with those actors.

{"prompt":"In the near-future you get a female clone of yourself to raise as your daughter , while showing her some old pictures , you realize that she looks exactly like your sister at that age","text":"In the near-future you get a female clone of yourself to raise as your daughter, while showing her some old pictures, you realize that she looks exactly like your sister at that age.\nYou ask her what she remember of her family, she just tells you about her mother, and that she died shortly after she was born.\nShe goes on to tell you that although she was raised by one her step mother's family after her mother's death, that her own mother was a drug addict and died in prison when she was 6.\nThe girl goes on to tell you how her mother was just gone, and that the only thing that stopped her from being addicted was having some of her ex boyfriend's heroin.\nAs it's been 3 years since you had seen your sister, you ask her what she's doing, and she just tells you she got a new job working as a hostess at this \" place, a strip club \".\nYou tell her about the girl who's been following her all along ( the girl from the pictures you had seen ) and how she's done all kinds of weird things to her that day.\nShe tells you that she wants you to meet her to discuss, and you go with her.\nShe tells you about what happened in the car and about the girl's father, you know that

girl's father \" you remember him? \".\nWell in the past when you've seen the pictures, this man could be seen in them, and now he takes the form of your sister.\nIn a sort of flashback scene, the girl sees her father die in her mother's arms three years earlier, she is then taken by this man and forced to perform oral sex on him until he comes.\nAfter that the girl realizes that she has to save her sister from this father - she uses her father's name to track them down, and the girl admits she's been using drugs since her step mother's family took over.\nThis does mean both her mother and sister are dead?\nThen they return to this girl, she tells you how her sister is really her daughter - the girl in the picture is your sister and she's been taken and forced to perform oral on her father since she knew she was pregnant.\nYou also have to understand that the girl isn't the only one, that the father of the girl is the same person who took her mother and sister away, if he's found out that he won't like his daughter having this knowledge.\nThe father was an abusive father to the girl, with an abusive personality.\nYou also get into an alternate timeline where the father of the girl is alive - he has kidnapped the woman, he tortured the girl before taking her into the woods and forcing her to live as a \" house pet \" of his.\nYour sister is kidnapped here as well and taken to an uninhabited mansion, to live with her abusive step daddy, while in the picture of her father's death, he also had his sister murdered.\nThe guy in the car had also been sent there to interrogate

{"prompt":"( WP ) a person suffering from schizophrenia has been hearing the same voice in their head since childhood . Today , they encounter the person with that voice in real life .","text":"( WP ) a person suffering from schizophrenia has been hearing the same voice in their head since childhood. Today, they encounter the person with that voice in real life. Now they understand what goes in there heads.\nThe voice that a person suffering from schizophrenia has been hearing is the voice of their own conscience (which, according to traditional Catholic doctrine, is a personal and distinct entity distinct from God, as well as their own body, mind and senses). If the person has any doubt, the voice is all confidence, and the person\u2019s actions are in accord with that. This voice has been warning this person to do more than what the speaker has agreed with, to be more than the speaker expects.\nThe main characteristic of the voice that a person suffering from schizophrenia is hearing is that it tries to deceive people, causing the person suffering from schizophrenia to question their own conscience, and to feel they have done something that is contrary to what they know is right; to be unwilling to do what the speaker sees as important; and to be ready to say or act something contrary to what they think.\nThis voice is always right, no matter what the speaker wants, and what the speaker thinks. This is exactly what causes the difficulties faced by this type of person. The speaker has no way of making other people think it is right to listen to what it says unless the speaker thinks that it is right to force people to listen to the speaker. If the speaker sees that things will be more successful if other people do not listen to the speaker, the speaker will try to convince others to listen to the speaker with the false idea that the speaker is right, while what the speaker thinks is right, is exactly opposite to what the speaker is doing.\nAll the voices in the person\u2019s head is telling this person something. If they think it is wrong, they believe it, regardless of what the voice says, and how much the voice says it is right.\nWhen a person with psychosis hears voices that go one part of the brain, the person with psychosis hears voices that tell them that they are making mistakes, that they do not need to listen to the voices, or that they are not following any rule or directive, or that the only way to go forward in life is to say what the voice says. The person begins to think they are the ones who are following a wrong path, that the voice is telling them what they should be doing and the voice has to be obeyed. If the person has the strength to listen to other voices, like the person hearing the voice of their own conscience, they begin to think they are the one who is right, and that they need to listen to everybody else and not to themselves.\nWhen a person with psychosis hears voices that go the other side of the brain, they begin to think that everything around them, including other people, and their own conscience, are not consistent with the truth, and that the truth is something different. The voice says something about the truth, and then something completely opposite is said. This voice can lead the person to think there is something wrong with the world, or with them, or with the person telling the person what their role should be in the world. If the person is a Catholic, the person with schizophrenia may believe there is some evil in the world, and they need to be more consistent. If the person is also a Muslim, the person with schizophrenia may begin to think that there are bad influences in their family. If the person is a Buddhist, the person with schizophrenia may begin to think there is some kind of hidden evil that they cannot

{"prompt":"The year is 3000 A.D . The people of Earth worship Ancient demigods . You see an image of the God of the Sea , and you ask an elder how he came to have those many gold medallions around his neck .","text":"The year is 3000 A.D. The people of Earth worship Ancient demigods. You see an image of the God of the Sea, and you ask an elder how he came to have those many gold medallions around his neck. The elder informs you that these are the marks of his immortality. He is one of a few that has a mortal body.\nYou move to the image of the God of the Wind, and ask an elder of his ability to lift loads of weights. He tells you that he is used to this. To him, it\u2019s just the daily grind of being a mortal, however good he\u2019s at.\nYou turn to the image of the God of Fire and ask, \u201cHave you ever experienced anything beyond your mortal self?\u201d You receive an instant answer. \u201c No, \u201d the elder informs you. \u201c There\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know. \u201d The elder turns towards the God of Water and asks the same question. This time he gets an immediate answer. \u201c Yes. \u201d The Elder walks to the image of the Gods of Light and Darkness. A third answer comes instantly. His voice rises and falls in a cadence of unparalleled power, with a soft and calm cadence. The elder looks at them and says, \u201c I love all of you. \u201d In the distance you can make out a faint hum. Like the humming of a waterfall. Then, suddenly, as the picture fades away, a song strikes your ears, a voice echoes through the caverns.\nA voice of a man in his fifties, with deep notes, calling out words that come from the heart of darkness. The dark comes rushing to him, a rush that\u2019s even stronger than the tide going out.\nA voice that comes for you, and will come for you, until you are no longer. This is your destiny, and there is nothing you can do to avoid it, nor anything to be done about it.\nSophrology is the combination of relaxation and psychic awareness. It is the art of living consciously.\nYou can choose to be conscious of your breathing. To be conscious of your heartbeat. To be aware of your body movements. To be aware of your thoughts. And choose when to turn them. To be aware of how your thoughts affect your body, and how your body affects your thoughts. To choose how to treat pain. To choose how to recover from illness. To be aware of how you feel about what you\u2019ve just experienced, and how it affects you. This is what the work of relaxation is all about. Being in the here and now, being present in the moment that you are living.\nOnce you\u2019re aware of yourself in every sense, you then add the awareness of emotions. Feel those emotions. What you feel, becomes you. Don\u2019t deny it. Feel it! Suck in. Out. In. Out. Feel it! Hold it. Feel it! Feel it! Feel it!\nThe more in tune you are with your body and your feelings, the more power you have to make choices of your own. This is what psychic awareness is all about. Noticing what\u2019s happening around you and being present to them. How does your day look to you? What do your dreams seem like?\nWe often have the impression that our world is divided in two. There\u2019s the real world and then you put the veil over it, and then you put an extra layer of protection over that.","token_len":736,"entropy":[6.8972,2.5904,9.3468,3.4778,0.1033,0.4112,0.5895,2.8559,6.0839,0.8155,4.1229,6.5844,9.1119,12.0368,0.3017,0.0485,1.8673,5.4776,3.8811,5.4687,2.9902,0.1881,2.0115,4.9114,1.0224,1.7528,3.5529,1.6881,3.1544,1.7413,4.0502,6.4083,6.4419,3.7502,1.2785,2.9479,0.2904,3.8676,5.5616,7.1337,8.5302,6.0422,0.0423,0.0002,5.5837,1.9641,0.3056,0.3594,1.6702,0.9153,6.5288,0.0909,0.1833,4.4817,2.1652,1.578,8.0197,0.2724,2.1592,5.6082,0.8679,2.4337,3.1007,4.8183,0.2018,4.3067,2.0044,3.4896,3.2807,3.5119,6.2775,1.3702,1.4515,2.9628,6.608,6.4647,1.5431,0.8006,7.1172,0.1898,0.909,1.393,0.1196,0.184,8.7324,1.0448,0.8831,3.0746,3.7079,0.1919,5.5119,3.1351,6.4103,0.7926,5.6877,9.1227,0.3932,4.8203,0.9019,1.4829,1.0399,0.0166,0.3132,1.2323,1.6272,7.0117,0.095,2.6683,2.128,5.7283,3.7319,0.4069,2.4357,16.4589,8.176,2.7034,3.8573,2.8736,7.75,2.1676,0.5081,3.4667,1.4983,4.0799,2.3967,6.8667,6.533,1.7428,11.1335,0.1559,0.0899,4.3304,4.6638,1.8861,0.7683,5.1466,0.9672,0.8575,1.4498,0.0215,0.3831,0.8524,0.0529,4.3059,3.0671,0.5916,3.0184,3.4953,5.3633,8.3644,0.3002,0.5631,4.523,3.2222,6.3641,3.2405,2.3206,3.5399,0.7209,1.1507,6.4783,2.709,4.9891,1.9746,6.8721,1.7664,1.4132,4.4732,0.8037,10.6287,0.9102,3.8505,5.5392,5.5573,5.4595,4.7839,0.0328,1.1235,1.9942,0.5076,4.1809,1.7741,0.5633,0.08,2.3336,4.516,6.1593,1.9824,0.9439,1.0223,0.1891,0.4958,1.6583,2.9519,2.4496,3.1405,1.8742,5.3089,5.3712,1.5024,3.3291,0.0695,3.3921,0.9626,1.0189,4.2508,3.392,0.4025,0.8227,4.9979,1.3851,2.3655,5.8395,3.6433,3.427,0.694,0.2997,1.1843,0.6676,2.6325,2.1452,1.2219,1.3628,1.4257,2.2929,6.9588,2.8632,0.3528,1.52,0.066,0.1681,4.3923,1.3273,3.3123,0.3923,3.0513,1.2117,4.8509,6.6649,4.279,2.2311,8.0423,0.5514,5.6674,4.477,4.1595,2.4861,4.8024,2.7784,2.2809,8.6064,0.034,2.1674,8.918,3.8903,2.5135,4.799,1.7873,6.0199,2.9187,4.0745,5.1548,0.0059,0.7939,1.8013,3.1157,4.1861,1.3107,7.8427,1.9793,1.4259,0.379,0.2165,1.7256,5.418,5.3446,5.4731,0.6157,0.6864,0.9294,1.2662,1.5592,5.2247,2.1643,5.8218,2.7228,1.4081,5.202,0.2156,2.2015,5.1064,6.3435,1.2142,7.1111,2.0956,5.1364,0.1629,1.143,5.6886,0.6181,5.6759,1.7952,4.3438,0.3032,5.1561,2.2689,7.3116,2.7959,1.5275,0.2036,2.5172,5.9145,7.1081,1.2747,1.4421,2.2746,3.3932,3.732,6.9502,2.0917,0.6538,6.2282,0.9287,1.436,1.2311,3.611,3.459,3.0288,2.6019,2.5653,2.903,2.6383,2.5926,0.0073,0.0088,1.8519,3.3031,5.2728,8.0696,1.9755,5.8332,1.5368,4.7989,2.0869,4.6985,1.3303,1.7453,3.0996,1.4154,5.5947,0.4483,2.1137,6.702,5.8317,4.1821,2.5306,1.2612,1.0816,3.8258,6.165,0.8842,7.3262,1.6743,0.1067,5.9495,2.3501,0.8075,1.0632,7.1437,7.8713,2.8227,1.2806,1.6373,2.6051,1.2514,2.3145,4.0854,6.6097,1.1155,1.1214,2.4396,5.9939,3.063,0.6565,0.2372,1.9019,5.5483,0.6351,1.8677,3.2061,0.491,3.8158,4.8676,0.8939,2.5621,3.2676,1.559,1.421,4.5444,0.5213,2.0576,1.0782,0.0811,0.0727,1.7239,4.3135,0.2626,3.1253,4.5914,4.4018,2.6555,3.7353,2.6956,1.1018,0.017,0.2259,0.9501,6.8449,5.1933,15.3259,1.7864,1.8682,8.919,0.0421,9.1998,0.6289,7.2317,5.2455,0.4873,1.6271,0.7694,1.2037,3.5856,0.1452,4.5747,7.4128,1.7598,2.1593,2.1842,3.705,3.6101,0.946,2.7463,5.1938,0.8647,1.2865,7.2975,2.3373,3.9645,1.7453,0.5678,0.2427,0.5781,3.3163,0.7395,0.2813,0.55,2.4804,0.0345,0.3393,2.9438,4.8655,0.2655,0.4712,0.3603,0.3286,0.0356,0.3556,2.6731,0.3866,4.4678,8.4894,6.3753,0.8227,5.3097,5.7658,2.1625,3.3134,2.1669,0.725,0.0599,3.319,2.201,2.282,3.3999,1.9777,1.682,2.2955,1.5057,0.6588,1.3027,1.6008,2.6396,1.6845,2.8843,0.1373,2.8046,1.8576,2.495,0.7468,5.0564,3.8665,0.9858,0.4781,0.6968,0.4543,0.0689,6.944,0.365,2.9551,0.2423,0.7909,3.4903,0.3338,0.0925,1.3159,2.3755,1.3079,2.6348,4.4358,0.5766,7.6444,0.6934,1.5721,3.6047,1.0491,2.5752,0.6658,0.5909,2.2953,1.541,0.3515,0.3534,4.3231,0.3291,2.6364,3.2777,6.9598,0.5543,6.6846,1.7074,0.5238,0.0006,0.3636,7.1886,4.5691,1.4602,7.2519,0.067,0.0062,1.3215,3.0525,4.1866,1.6362,0.5737,2.3031,5.8623,1.4226,0.9811,5.5803,1.7344,0.8989,5.6805,0.2853,9.2446,0.2499,2.3696,2.9523,0.1474,3.2062,3.4825,5.8734,3.1628,0.7849,1.0426,6.1011,8.2255,2.6506,6.954,0.5278,6.2124,1.6978,4.919,7.1953,1.0566,1.6537,5.556,1.8583,1.0652,1.8951,7.9435,5.1505,0.4359,6.16,0.395,0.4483,0.0406,6.1384,1.9407,0.4597,3.2192,1.9216,5.9957,7.2491,3.159,4.4783,2.8311,8.6524,0.5433,4.8973,0.3819,2.6877,0.4125,2.7645,0.7616,1.0118,6.6689,0.7218,1.1086,2.422,0.1014,0.7743,2.6056,0.0966,0.2988,1.776,0.0612,0.1513,1.9539,2.5632,4.14,6.9146,3.3525,1.9488,0.4029,0.2907,1.197,1.7875,2.1872,2.4098,4.2708,0.3935,0.0488,0.4516,6.5936,0.5459,1.0104,3.1362,3.9228,3.2936,5.0074,2.2198,0.7374,0.3855,3.271,0.4172,1.8345,6.6481,1.7197,0.4219,0.0808,0.0002,0.2128,6.301,8.1883,2.7457,8.1344,0.2188,0.9981,0.9802,2.1661,0.0302,2.8922,4.9904,3.5867,3.6422,2.0593,1.2783,5.3513,6.727,1.8105,7.855,4.0621,3.598,0.3706,0.7735,1.978,1.8569,3.5168,2.1012,3.9484,0.4404,0.4532,3.6315,5.9209,4.8329,3.4635,2.8672,3.9963,0.1117,2.2274,4.3527,0.4274,5.5128,3.3603,0.7495,1.1439,3.4062,3.4597,0.1048,0.3786,2.4579,5.585,0.762,1.9248,4.8838,6.3521,5.7395,2.5023,6.8486

Upon arrival on the red planet, the astronauts notice some kind of cave, containing a single human skeleton \u2013 and four words, carved into a wall. Their curiosity is piqued, and they decide to investigate further, along with Dr. Anna ( Laura Harrier ) of Britain-based astrobiology corporation The Ark. Their search leads them on a tour of the world\u2019s longest desert tunnel, reaching as far as the ice-rich poles of Mars. But what are the strange carvings all about, and why does an ancient Martian race call them \u201c the seven signs of Z \u201d?\nThe first three episodes \u2013 the series\u2019 pilot and two regular series \u2013 are available to stream now on Netflix. The first two episodes featured in Netflix\u2019s series, \u201cThe Seven Signs of Z \u201d ( 2020 ), will eventually make it to The Criterion Collection in digital on 5\/11\/20. The show will be available to rent and purchase on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, Digital HD and DVD.\n\u201cThe Seven Signs of Z \u201d marks Steven Knight\u2019s ( Game of Thrones ) directorial debut for Netflix \u2013 a feature-length adaptation of the critically-acclaimed 2014 novel of the same name by Daniel Abraham. The series is set to premiere on Netflix on 26\/11\/20.\nIn July of 2013, Netflix acquired the rights to \u201cThe Seven Signs of Z \u201d, the fourth novel in Daniel Abraham\u2019s Mars trilogy. Abraham had written the trilogy in a year \u2013 the first two books in a series focusing on a post-apocalyptic Mars. While the third book in the trilogy, \u201c The Significant Other of Mars \u201d, was set in what some speculate is more of a contemporary Earth environment, \u201c The Seven Signs of Z \u201d focuses on a pre-Mars setting.\n\u201cThe seventh sign is the most profound and moving. A message of hope, something you will take forward into a post-Mars New Earth and live.\u201d\nIn one line of dialogue from The Seven Signs of Z, Abraham explained the importance of that last verse \u2013 \u201c A message of hope, something you will take forward into a post-Mars New Earth and live. \u201d\nIn the novel, Z is a fictitious Mars civilization that exists in a world heavily burdened by war, pollution, and political instability. In his novel, Daniel Abraham told the story of a girl named Teri ( Laura Harrier ) whose family and friends are slaughtered by a warlord in Z. Teri wakes up after being shot and finds herself stranded on a deserted planet. It\u2019s now up to Teri to find a way to stop the destruction of her civilization, but it takes time. After a few months of survival, Teri builds a community in a cave, in hopes of convincing a Martian crew to help bring back civilization to Earth.\nHowever, all hope is not lost. During her search for help, Teri becomes romantically involved with David ( Tom Hollander ), the last man left on Mars. While David willingly helps Teri bring his civilization on board with her own, he\u2019s reluctant to leave his own, in hopes of saving his wife and daughter.

There was a town called Nostromo. The town was made up of two separate districts, the residential part and the industrial part. While the residents of the town kept to themselves and lived in peace, a group of terrorists known as the Grayzone militia was roaming the place. Their target was the towns leaders and they were planning on setting fire to the homes of the town people, causing massive loss of life. Luckily, a group of rebels saw what the terrorists were doing and confronted them. After fighting hard and taking a lot of death, the rebels destroyed the terrorists and saved thousands of lives. The rebels soon found that the terrorists had left the town and they left the town in peace again. One day, Nostromo, the residential part of the town caught fire and a group of people ran outside. They tried to put out the fire, but it wasn't possible to do so as the people running outside tried to go back in. A helicopter arrived and picked them up. As they tried to explain the situation to the people in the helicopter a man called Rafe McCormick told them to follow him. Rafe pulled away from the helicopter and his group ran in the direction they thought the fire was from, and in so doing they realised that the people in the helicopter were terrorists. The helicopter landed and the terrorists opened fire on the people in the helicopter. The entire group was shot instantly except for Rafe, the people in the helicopter wanted to kill him, but they were shot in the leg instead. They went back and found a gun, threw it at him, but he shot back and shot the man dead. The pilot of the helicopter then opened it wide and sent all the people in the helicopter outside along with the men. The men were trying to fight back the terrorists and kill them, Rafe was shot in the leg, but he managed to kill the man before he got away. Before the terrorists were killed, Rafe fired his gun and shot an arrow through the helicopter.\nA man called Max Payne stumbles into a bar where he finds two people and tells them that he killed one of them. The two guys flee and the man follows them. He finds them and the second guys body which had just died. He cuts him down and takes them home to look after him. It was found that he had used up all the air in that house and was going to die there. He put a hole in the ceiling that ran all the way down to the floor so he managed to open a door but it was sealed at the bottom. He called the person called, \" AKA \", who lived in the flat above, but no answer. He then remembered that the window was open so he climbed up and threw the person into the yard next to his house. Later, a police report came in saying that the room was full of blood and someone was missing. It was the man he had helped.

{"prompt":"SatChat : Do you have ambitions for a writing career , or is writing more a hobby ?","text":"SatChat : Do you have ambitions for a writing career, or is writing more a hobby? If it's a hobby, can we use a character of yours, or have I failed? What is your favourite animal?\nIf I'm a little like you, the answer to the first two questions will be yes, and yes to the third. I want to write about things other people haven't even thought of yet, about things I'll never be able to see. Even if some things I write are not about animals, animals in my novels make my novels come alive, and that's something I can never get enough of.\nI'm not sure I'm a fan of dogs, though my first two books include one dog. I have three cats and several dogs. My first two novels featured a dog called Popsie, which is also my adopted fictional dog (though, as far as I know, she never really existed, just a pet of mine), and my third, Unfinished Lace, is about a pet shop which was also about a pet I had (and loved) when I first attended college. I think my first successful animal story was the story of a cat named Floppy, which was included in The Unliverse and the first novella in The Unlost. I loved the characters of Floppy and his humanoid owner, the guy who owned a pet shop with his own store, and had a very weirdly named cat who lived at another woman's house. I like the way these stories can work on their own, but I find it interesting when the writing is part of a series, especially a series featuring cats. Cats can get a bit too much attention. I think.\nI have a friend who used to be an actor, but stopped acting at the age of 50. He's still on stage, but he calls his role on the stage \"speech\" rather than performance. He still has his \"actor's eye\" at work a little, and has become very good at capturing the subtle movements in others. This is something I've done in books, and even, in one of my most recent projects, in a couple of the poems. I can't help wondering if all of the details I add in the writing are there for the reader. I also wonder if too much of this leads to the story losing it's mystery. And with a more literary, less plot-driven writing style, I think I would like to be able to bring to the writing a little of the clarity of thinking that an actor can, and be amazed how much I've learned by simply allowing myself to live the characters. Maybe I can use this in some day-to-day writing?\nYour short stories have won numerous awards, including the Hugos, Nero Award and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. What were your motivations for writing short stories?\nIt seems like a silly question, but I really didn't know what I was going to write about until I wrote the first draft of a very short story. I tried to do a lot of research of some sort, but nothing seemed to get me anywhere, so I just started writing the first lines. I did my best to ignore the fact that I didn't have the time or resources to go through my notes and write the rest of the story. After I'd written maybe 10 lines or so of something, I realized that my story needed to have some action at the beginning. As I started writing, I realized that this was, in fact, a novel.

{"prompt":"You are hired to write the holy text for a new religion . What is the first chapter of the text ?","text":"You are hired to write the holy text for a new religion. What is the first chapter of the text?\" In response to the question, the crowd said, \"This chapter is written so that we become wise.\" In response, the Jewish leader said, \"We demand you show us the scriptures so that we may be saved.\" Then they demanded, \"Show the scriptures so we may be saved!\" When the rabbis asked them, \"Show the scriptures so we may be saved!\" they said, \"Show the scriptures so we may be happy!\" In response, the rabbis said, \"What scripture?\" When they were unable to respond, the rabbis began to argue with them, \"Why are you arguing with each other? Show the scriptures so we may be saved! For if we reject these, we have no reason to live - and you have no reason to be killed.\"\nAt last the rabbis asked them, \"So show the scriptures.\" Then they were silent, so the rabbis said \"You are not able to understand. If you reject these, you have no reason to live - and if we accept them, we are no different from them!\" Finally, he said \"Show them to us so we may be saved and happy and wise.\" The Jewish leaders said, \"If we show them to you, you will surely kill us.\" Then they asked to show them. Jesus said, \"A little higher\". The rabbis then asked \"Show us one chapter from the prophecies of the Old Testament!\" Jesus said, \"Go back to your rabbis and ask them, 'When you want them to be fulfilled then what does the reading say?'\" In response, the crowd asked them, \"What does the reading say?\" Now the question was repeated, \"What does the prophecy about Moses say?\" When the question was repeated Jesus said \"Go ask those who know the prophecy.\" No one answered, and finally Jesus said to their leaders, \"You have not read the prophecies about me written before my birth, which said, 'The Spirit of the Lord God will be with me, he will guide me wherever he pleases, and he will bring me back into the land of my ancestors?'\"\nAs we prepare to celebrate our Lord's birthday, let us pray for these Jewish leaders to see the wisdom of the Scriptures. Let God show them that Jesus is the Messiah. In Jesus, even a blindness to the Scriptures becomes a gift. Let us pray.\nHow do they do it? I am not sure but I bet there are many different factors. One big factor seems to be the lack of leadership and courage in people to change their ways. Another is the fact that the very power and authority that were entrusted on them has been taken back from them and put into the hands of others. Perhaps the most significant factor, though, is this - many people today simply don't want to do anything except accept what everyone else is doing. No one seems to want to look at the big picture - but I have learned that if you take a little time and look at the big picture you can see that the answer isn't so simple. I have learned through my own experience that the Scripture that says, \"Don't just let what everyone else does become your religion. Keep my commandments. Learn from them.\" is the answer to all of us.\nWhat should we say to that? It seems to me - if we are truly to live our faith in Jesus the Christ - we must learn the wisdom of the Scriptures.

{"prompt":"A good Demon and a bad Angel fight while arguing ethics .","text":"A good Demon and a bad Angel fight while arguing ethics. Which side do you choose?\nI can't decide... but I'm sure the evil angels and demons would prefer they shouldn't know about the other. Maybe they know each other, but don't really like each other and decided to split up and stay apart so they shouldn't be talking to each other and they don't interact with each other. I don't know the demonic or angel things happen for real...\nMy favorite character is Hikari I would like one with a catty, sassy personality. My favorite fandom is Fairy Tail\nMy favorite character is the girl who does the acting part for the anime, and her name is Satoru, she's a girl who is a good friend to Ryoma.\nMine is a cute otaku guy named Yuu. He was a total jerk when he first came to the academy for the new year, but then he found his best friend, Koshiro.\nMy favorite character is Limei! She's so cute!! My favorite fandom is Violet Evergarden! Her and Yuu are the most adorable in my opinion... :'( <3\nThe girl (or maybe even two girls?!) who made me love Madoka and Mirai are the girl who did all the comedy parts in Madoka. She makes so much sense.\nMy favorite character is Madoka... I loved her from the start. I just thought she was amazing... She was the coolest girl out of all the characters.\nMy favorite character in anime world goes to...Sister Rosa!! She comes next to the God of light, Christ, and the Virgin Mary for this contest!! My favorite fandom is a lot of hardcore anime and comic fans. My main fandom is called Fate\/Zero... but I also like other stuff! I've also watched all of the Anime... some of them I've even written my own chapters about, like... My favorite anime is probably Madoka... but I'm not sure... I'd have to say probably My Hero Academia right now though...\nI liked Tatsumi so much that I did a full character blog on him from the start :3 Tatsumi's personality was so diverse. He was so funny, kind and caring but at the same time strong and even when he died he made me cry. He also was the most powerful anime character I saw so far.\nMy sister and her roommate both made me love these characters... so much so that I want to go a different route now and write about them... if only I knew where they were :'(\nPI:USER Oh no, sadly... :( I think you guys should try the anime called Fairy Tail... it's so cute and fun!!\nPI:USER Yeah, you have to try a different route!! Maybe a more... darker... route... :'( It's hard to find a book that has a darker... well, dark? route... it's so hard...\nPI:USER Hey, thanks for saying that, I definitely need to get a new route going. I think a romance route would be interesting... :'( But yeah... I think I'm going with the storytelling route and not so much an action\/comedy stuff :)\nOh and I totally agree...

The government develops an experiment where somebody is to be placed into a large chamber in the middle of the city and awoken every 50 years for just one week. Your name is chosen. You are a doctor and your job is to find out what is causing all the strange behavior that has developed in the 50 years. There is a mysterious disease that has appeared in your hometown and it has been infecting the people without them even knowing. People are now walking on their heads and are becoming completely paranoid. They are losing control. You have 2 years to solve it \u2026but you will go back into cryostasis immediately after your experiment is terminated. Do you accept the challenge?\nHudson is a new independent company dedicated to improving lives in cities. Our mission is to enhance the health and vitality of communities. We think the health of cities has been largely disregarded due to the prevalence of urban design that has been disconnected from the people living within it. Our strategy is to bring in the expertise in nature-based medicine to cities, so that the community\u2019s health can be improved naturally. Our goal is to develop a network of partnerships to establish urban farms throughout the urban landscape so that citizens can become involved in creating a food ecosystem and the health of their cities improves.\nOur aim is to deliver a healthy urban culture, where healthy communities share the best aspects of urban agriculture. Food production is a source of livelihood, the environment is kept healthier, and local economies grow. As a result, more people can be able to live in cities and have access to healthier foods from urban farms.\nAs part of Hudson, we are running experiments to investigate the feasibility of establishing urban farms to address the health of the cities in which they are located. These experiments are aimed at establishing whether urban farms are, in fact, useful in resolving problems related to food security, obesity, and population health.\nThrough urban farming experiments, we are looking for ways to increase the uptake of local agriculture through the introduction of new urban farming models coupled with the adoption of innovative business models. The proposed approaches will need to integrate both the use of existing urban infrastructures as well as new urban developments. The proposed approaches must have a strong relationship with communities and the city to ensure that food security is a priority.\nDr. Joseph Staley has been researching the benefits of natural medicine and alternative medicines for over 25 years. He is the author of 7 books including his own breakthrough work, The Natural Way: How the Ancient Art of Healing Can Now Save Us. Joseph is passionate about helping people in the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle, and he spends a lot of his time lecturing and consulting on different natural solutions. His most recent work is a book, The Art of Healing.

Instead, I thought this was the type of book review that my younger sister would write because it spoke to me and my life in many ways.\nOne of the main things I learned about writing was being open to my readers. I realized that I needed to include my personal experiences when I wrote about certain topics.\nI also heard in the book that there are four stages for a novel.

{"prompt":"In Jurassic Park 3 , a suburban family is woken up by a Tyrannosaurus Rex . Finish that side story , using any perspective you wish .","text":"In Jurassic Park 3, a suburban family is woken up by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Finish that side story, using any perspective you wish. If I were to choose one, I\u2019d pick an urban fantasy setting, maybe even a post-apocalyptic one. I like setting a world with more people and less wildlife, and not in the past. Now that I know the importance I place on this part of it, the questions about time are irrelevant. It\u2019s really just the backdrop I choose. I\u2019m not interested in time travel and I don\u2019t want it to be in my story. I have a bunch of ideas for those two things, I just don\u2019t think it will work in a story that isn\u2019t about human interactions.\nA little less than two years ago, after being diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, I got myself to write a fantasy story called The Last Story of a Rogue Warrior, a story I wrote with the idea that I might someday revise and sell. (Although I never planned to.) It did come about as a by-product of my efforts to find out more things I could control. There\u2019s an old proverb from the Tao, \u201cYou cannot turn your back on the past and expect to reach the future.\u201d It\u2019s hard to turn your back even if you just try, I guess, but with practice you can, and in many cases it makes all the difference. I had already started The Last Story of a Rogue Warrior, so I started researching what might have happened. I found out about the life of the explorer Richard Henry Stoddert, who I had already read about in my AMAW. It became very clear to me that Richard Stoddert and his friend, Sir Walter Raleigh, were destined to spend time together. I knew Richard Stoddert would eventually go back to England and become secretary to the Earl of Essex, who would then become First Lord of the Admiralty, and after Richard Stoddert\u2019s death, Lord Burghley would take over the office (though he\u2019d not yet been born by the time Stoddert sailed). This is the background of my current novel, The Last Battle of Europe, for which I started writing a while ago.\nI hope so, but I honestly do not care. The fact is a lot of writers never do. Some writing projects end up in the trash because they didn\u2019t seem to go anywhere and some end up in the bestseller lists because someone thought it was worth putting out there. And a lot of writers are just not willing to put up with certain kinds of criticism or they don\u2019t have courage. All they care about is finding something interesting they want to write about and they want to get away from something that might seem boring, so instead of actually finding the interesting part of a project they decide that an interesting part doesn\u2019t exist.\nI find most books I write about what interests me about them. But sometimes I start a project that I find quite boring to write; if it\u2019s a romance, I suppose it\u2019s interesting to explore the characters\u2019 feelings and motivations, but I won\u2019t enjoy writing that if I start thinking about the end. I think we all have things we are interested in and the more interested we are in them, the more likely we are to find something to write about that we enjoy. I\u2019ve found I love more what I write if I keep writing a variety of kinds of stories, but I hope I don\u2019t end up writing only one kind forever.","token_len":746,"entropy":[12.4003,0.2866,5.1088,0.7363,3.2308,9.3856,4.4338,2.6101,8.025,0.4384,0.278,0.4918,0.7705,8.4995,0.0136,0.4923,1.9113,13.3119,3.2486,9.9758,4.0076,1.5767,8.5948,5.4363,8.9136,1.0681,4.0531,1.0276,4.3799,4.8954,2.2769,1.4038,4.4014,2.4077,2.851,0.798,18.4254,8.5256,2.5843,2.3436,4.0716,5.143,3.3807,2.792,1.7657,5.5154,3.0272,0.988,4.4515,0.1675,0.0484,0.0221,1.2022,0.5767,2.4869,3.7946,5.9938,3.2068,2.5574,3.2282,5.9959,4.0633,2.1401,3.0087,5.0884,1.2359,1.6933,4.7551,4.7153,1.5668,6.4491,0.8156,6.7359,2.2441,0.8038,2.6991,2.2077,6.5819,7.2041,3.1944,0.4161,3.432,4.8312,0.445,5.0522,0.2203,4.1803,5.8131,3.8339,5.0788,4.4972,5.0128,0.5431,3.1016,3.8355,1.1835,0.0589,4.9148,2.1547,2.7394,6.6074,5.0462,2.7387,1.2804,2.2047,2.2888,0.2011,2.5526,1.9954,4.1013,0.045,4.2841,0.9892,3.2077,3.7909,1.4954,1.0366,0.5836,0.0908,1.1529,3.351,0.2806,1.2495,3.8155,3.2119,4.7641,0.5077,1.446,4.3331,1.8062,6.2687,0.0253,3.1589,1.4554,6.1058,4.3105,1.4944,0.9509,4.0337,2.0573,0.957,0.0818,0.1794,0.0404,2.8924,1.6607,3.1532,1.6374,2.7668,2.078,2.344,2.0922,3.9064,0.5197,0.4032,0.4509,2.0876,4.8079,4.7384,1.0356,2.2151,7.0429,4.3127,5.1447,2.2397,2.3026,1.0316,0.4673,0.3875,5.3453,4.1741,4.9022,0.033,4.6498,1.9402,3.0777,0.0081,0.1716,0.6105,3.4395,6.1644,4.1399,5.1391,0.8117,5.569,1.8436,2.0174,2.2162,4.2589,4.188,1.9309,2.6172,6.6179,4.8554,2.2288,2.1905,1.8441,2.5539,3.3855,2.2996,2.8974,4.0876,0.9056,1.6149,3.1558,3.8522,9.4255,2.5626,7.7349,2.4168,4.6939,5.3812,0.9977,3.7185,4.6766,1.1508,2.2897,2.3407,5.7396,4.3874,4.244,3.3172,0.55,7.7709,1.3345,0.0053,0.0272,1.4388,5.2721,0.8978,3.5524,3.622,1.6657,8.3876,3.4396,1.5698,7.685,2.0506,4.7511,4.6238,0.2291,0.057,3.2822,3.0348,5.6601,3.2356,1.3091,9.0706,2.8403,7.0031,7.1565,5.5696,3.4828,5.0271,2.0821,0.4583,0.1472,1.617,1.9442,3.292,5.7175,0.8456,5.7484,1.157,1.0202,0.7094,4.0734,6.2532,2.8023,1.5596,0.1044,0.0481,4.4745,0.4885,2.6129,0.9001,0.0279,7.2979,1.3117,0.2971,5.8985,4.3221,2.8236,4.0121,2.8994,2.0886,2.0774,5.2889,6.7055,2.8487,0.7372,3.519,0.9886,4.5169,3.9777,0.638,2.4667,4.093,4.6288,0.1309,0.0203,0.395,2.0861,3.6845,4.0361,2.6088,7.6217,0.1704,0.0162,0.6251,0.1095,0.0631,0.0067,1.5282,2.9316,0.679,4.1778,5.6098,3.0986,4.1682,2.6374,1.2875,2.7134,1.2355,2.718,2.2388,2.4249,1.4384,6.8614,0.7735,2.2233,6.525,6.0989,6.7486,6.287,3.7715,7.7583,0.604,1.2974,6.2503,1.8154,5.8882,3.9758,0.3985,1.1832,2.1897,11.5287,10.5469,4.7621,3.1778,5.0519,3.8888,0.9104,1.3197,0.0237,0.3121,2.7992,3.5422,0.0007,0.0003,4.1134,0.5104,5.4555,1.3396,5.0194,4.2144,2.1172,0.2721,0.9673,6.6977,0.2519,5.4972,4.1321,1.2864,1.3717,2.3766,3.2477,3.5774,2.0236,0.0009,0.0004,1.7368,3.4605,3.3767,3.8831,0.4851,3.6882,1.4067,2.2393,9.614,1.2847,0.9816,3.9518,0.0464,4.4365,0.9422,2.5477,1.8104,3.1151,1.4493,5.7032,0.8729,0.2033,0.4046,0.9267,0.0014,1.857,0.9962,5.9272,3.1565,1.1704,0.0007,0.0008,5.6687,0.781,2.1185,0.5866,1.0105,4.2037,8.8481,1.3071,3.1174,1.3195,2.5565,0.6371,1.0674,4.6778,5.9574,3.7504,2.1635,3.3588,0.0462,0.4935,1.5596,5.7961,6.9186,4.1838,5.7353,1.5193,0.7579,5.3622,0.0005,0.0014,8.9324,2.9181,3.9231,2.4613,1.9468,6.4767,2.2939,1.8212,4.6475,2.4872,0.5672,0.8264,0.4421,7.4383,0.4039,7.5877,1.1231,5.5649,1.4761,0.2308,5.4919,2.0853,2.3432,7.3826,0.8654,0.3627,1.277,1.9522,4.3936,7.432,1.3879,2.8969,0.8817,6.5934,3.1949,0.1234,3.5551,1.2578,2.802,4.87,1.7472,7.0856,0.6727,0.1402,5.1723,5.8839,3.3798,1.4666,4.72,6.0721,5.1028,4.2214,0.4194,2.899,1.3061,4.1957,3.6812,0.5964,3.4794,0.7423,0.3211,0.0963,5.9414,0.6311,5.1005,2.4015,3.3067,2.7919,2.56,0.0091,0.9992,0.5616,4.0648,3.6897,1.6234,1.4052,6.1233,4.8365,1.5612,0.8397,3.2369,4.479,1.7585,1.493,0.3562,3.6205,4.3609,0.1495,0.0374,1.8017,3.1771,2.3576,2.3296,4.0259,0.0241,2.4474,3.1335,0.0921,6.9103,3.3572,0.0007,5.4382,2.8369,6.6583,1.6284,0.0747,0.0257,0.1004,2.9333,8.9791,2.3214,5.6336,2.4795,3.5526,0.0505,0.1479,4.0905,2.8494,3.5371,5.8995,2.1448,0.1273,0.8299,0.551,1.7989,3.2744,2.681,0.3613,3.1046,3.7031,1.3401,5.4278,0.8352,2.4774,3.447,3.4859,2.6654,3.8571,4.9764,0.2938,6.8,5.4056,3.9421,3.8598,4.528,0.8358,2.2253,3.9295,2.2236,3.8767,2.824,6.1872,1.1165,1.6877,4.7036,0.2618,0.0588,0.0074,3.7793,0.741,1.8757,1.71,5.2433,5.3038,5.2924,2.9964,1.3312,3.0709,6.9171,7.4037,0.0649,3.5425,2.5576,3.3441,4.8343,3.6088,1.2199,5.2003,3.5669,1.5501,1.5537,1.8408,3.5146,4.2954,2.5758,4.7229,0.2546,8.4544,4.2675,1.9466,1.6791,0.0261,0.0021,2.1276,4.5273,1.6379,2.1552,8.1323,2.3457,1.5905,0.0033,0.031,3.5001,1.9594,4.3654,1.9161,4.0821,4.3438,0.0155,11.2728,1.6696,2.6203,2.8117,1.7016,2.0716,5.9513,1.1873,0.0171,0.1302,5.7785,1.7756,3.4736,4.7982,1.0553,4.4667,2.9042,0.5054,1.8376,6.1361,2.6953,1.5523,2.4983,5.613,0.7867,1.6403,5.0143,1.5745,3.854,2.2885,0.0047,2.0497,4.3294,2.7215,4.7394,0.3291,0.8497,0.1657,1.6014,0.4864,0.0154,0.4309,3.2772,0.4266,0.1208,0.0256,2.6431,1.8535,3.9236,0.8756,0.0723,2.3759,1.3862,4.3796,0.7699,1.8566,4.2285,0.023,3.2925,2.4671,4.2366,3.3317,6.3476,6.0994,0.4798,1.47

{"prompt":"From birth , everybody has a word imprinted on their left arm . This is the last word they will ever say .","text":"From birth, everybody has a word imprinted on their left arm. This is the last word they will ever say. Some are given several words, others only one. When a baby is born, the person doing the naming has a choice of six words. It is important that you have no idea what to say, the important thing is that you do not say anything bad like \" death\", \"bad\", \"poison\", \"stinking\", or anything else like that. The person doing the naming can also give something like \" happy \" or \" lovely \".\n2. The person naming can use a pen or paper and write each word on them. When he gets to the name you are looking for, take the pen and draw, or even use a picture, a drawing, a picture or whatever.\n3. Use your memory to recall the first letter and the second or the third of the given word.\n4. Say a phrase such as :\n\" This is the first letter and this is the second or the third of the word \" name \" \"\n5. Say this phrase to each side of the child.\n6. As he grows grow older, he can say :\n\" This is the beginning of me'name \"\n7. As a kid is saying the name on the spot, the parent can move away from him.\n8. The parent should be close enough to the child and he should be able to hear him saying the name.\n9. The parent can stay next to the child as he says the name in front of himself and in front of everybody.\n10. When the baby was born, you can always name him as my child. But when he grows up, you can say this : This kid has a name, his name is \" name \".\nWhen a baby is born, the parents tell him that when he grows up, he'll be the king of the world, he will have many wives, the first day he'll go on a visit and he'll bring his wives back and they will give him a big present and their name is name.\nWhen he grows up, he does what he is told to do and he has a life full of fun. He's on the radio and has a job. He is making people laugh and people love him. They call him the king of the world because he has many wives and he's so beautiful and he always has a good time.\nThe best thing about calling him the king of the world is that even when you were a child, you had a good time being king.\nWhen he was a kid, he would have two or several names. When he grew up, all other people would call him by his first name. But friends would call him by his first name.\nIn the second case, even the first person to call the infant \" baby \" would tell his other friends that he's called a \" name \" instead of baby.\nWhen people call the infant by his first name when he grows up, the adult would tell her friends that she is called a \" name \" instead of a \" baby \".\nBut when she was young, she was called a \" name \" but when she was older, she was called a \" baby \" because everyone liked the first word.\nIn a couple of years, her parents and grandparents call her \" name \" to emphasize one thing.\nWhen the

What on earth does he do? He has gone on a holiday! He isn\u2019t going to answer to what I will say!\nNooooooooooooo. My future self. Is not going to answer to what I will say! I cannot receive his message!\nI believe it\u2019s something to do with his vacationing and not having any internet available. In the past, you had to send a message from today (tomorrow wasn\u2019t always possible), which was difficult.\nI believe it has to do with his vacationing.

Do you know what to do? Sometimes we can only assume when we get a message from our future self. What should we do?\nThe best way is to think about why is it important and if it works or not. It would be nice if it worked but if it doesn\u2019t, you don\u2019t have to worry about the answer.\nIf he needs a day or two to check his computer or any connection, he will send me a message. I just got a message from my future self. Do you know what to do? Sometimes we can only assume when we get a message from our future self. What should we do?\nI need to know why he didn\u2019t send a reply and if it was because of an error in the system. Sometimes it happens with people who don\u2019t know they have a future self. I wish they could be around right now!\nI would like to know why he doesn\u2019t reply and why it didn\u2019t work. The day it didn\u2019t work, I was on a vacation.\nI would like to know why the message didn\u2019t work and if he has a problem with some of his computers. My future self never answered my messages, but then, today he finally answered me.\nWhat on earth does he do? He just went on holiday but never showed up since! Could be the end of the messages!\nHe is on vacation! He doesn\u2019t write here. He is on vacation.

{"prompt":"Alaska still belongs to Russia . Write an alternate history piece from any time period .","text":"Alaska still belongs to Russia. Write an alternate history piece from any time period. A lot of this would depend on your characters. This is an ongoing project so I\u2019ll try to put up updates as I do more work. Follow the FB page or the blog for updates.\nThere is an alternate history game set in the same world of Alaska, it was developed by the folks at Trion Worlds and it has been put on the Steam store, you can check it out. It has different settings and scenarios but it is still the same world and the same game as the original. The game is called Alaska, the game features some factions as part of their campaigns. There are a lot of factions in the game, you could even see the expansion in the trailer. Here is the link to the alternate history game.\nThere is a very well known alternate history game called Eureka Springs with the setting of the same world of Alaska. The game is developed by Cyanide studio. The game doesn\u2019t release often and if you are fortunate to get it, it could cost you an arm and a leg. You would have to buy it online via digital distribution stores like Steam.\nThere is an alternate history movie set in Alaska also. Incredible film, check it out. I posted a few times as I found them.\nSo there you have it, a lot of information. Maybe someday I\u2019ll try to put up a story based on these settings. We\u2019re in the process of rebuilding these worlds and we have a lot of stories behind what could go on in these settings. Keep an eye out for it.\nThe setting is the same in all of the games and movies I listed. In most cases the setting is from the 1920\u2019s. Most of the stories set within our setting happen within a 20-year time range. This is a lot of story to do in a 20-year time period so most times the stories are set in a small area. Mostly the setting is in Alaska but there is a setting in Wyoming in an alternate universe and that\u2019s where most of our events happen.\nThe world is also called the world of America and most of the factions belong to the United States. The countries within the world have the same name as the countries in the United States. The only country in our settings that changed is Japan.\nI posted some of the settings, but I have to give my biggest thanks to the guy and woman up North, Alaska\u2019s most popular writer Mike and Jill of the M&J Alaska writing group for me having this fun world for me. They started a Facebook group called America\u2019s Best Setting, I joined it, it was filled with fan fiction in the settings of many famous movies and now my stories and fan fiction are being posted on their FB page.\nI hope this helps anyone who is struggling to come up with a story in the setting of Alaska, hopefully by sharing some of our settings that will help. If anyone doesn\u2019t like mine and they want to come up with their own, then this article will help them a lot.\nAll Rights Reserved, Please do not share images of this article without my permission or crediting me at\nThe World of Alaska is a virtual world and the setting is American. The world is set in Alaska. I am a fan of this world and when I started to read fan fiction in the setting of various movies in the setting, I started wondering what other stories happened in the world with the same characters.

{"prompt":"Two mods enter , one mod leaves .","text":"Two mods enter, one mod leaves.So, we know the number of mods entered at the given time.So, i have to find out the percentage (%) increase or decrease or remain constant.If a change occurs i would like to know where this change occured and the percentage of this change.Any help would be appreciated.   \nThanks \n\nA:\n\nHere we go :\n    public void getPercent(int[] mods)\n    {\n        double avg = 0;\n\n        for(int i =0;i<(mods[2] - mods[1]);i++)\n        {\n            avg = avg + (mods[i]*100)\/(mods[2] - mods[1]).intValue(); \/\/add 100 as you want to divide by the amount of time remaining.\n        }\n\n        for(int i =0;i<(mods[1] - mods[0]);i++)\n        {\n            avg = avg + (mods[i])*100\/(mods[1] - mods[0]).intValue(); \/\/add 1 as you want to divide by the amount of time remaining.\n        }\n\n        avg = avg \/ (mods[2] - mods[1]);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Current avg is \" + avg);\n        System.out.println(\"Now average is \" + avg);\n    }\n\nYour given time is 7 minutes, this means there are 7 minutes left. In your function, you have to pass 7 as the min mods. Also I don't see the \"i\" index as it's not very logical.\nTry debugging and see if you get the required output.\nEdit:\nI changed your code as per my comment and it gives the correct result :\n

Six months ago the first balloon expedition successfully crossed, today everyone waits in excitement for the explorers anticipated return. Only one pilot manned both balloons, but with each crossing he is given the chance to pilot the other. When he returns to his home he can say to his wife that he's just been on the moon. - The first American woman to make such a trip. - A pioneer in many other respects, especially in the field of space exploration. - Asked to comment upon the progress of science, she said,'If it keeps up at a rate of this sort, one ought to get the sun out for supper tomorrow'' - She is an old and dear friend, and is always very kind towards women.\nBEST DESCRIPTOR : A woman on the frontier of space research - She is one of the world's most illustrious scientists A pioneer of aviation - She pioneered the airship - She led the first expedition on the moon - She is a true'pioneer'- Her accomplishments in science have made her an example to all women - To men her fame is well assured - It is fitting that a woman like this should have made it possible for her sisters to do so - It is due to her achievements that women have come to enjoy higher appointments than men - She deserves our thanks - She is a remarkable woman of science - The success of her trip has greatly enhanced the prestige of the United States - She is the first woman on the moon - Among her achievements are her flights to the upper stratosphere, her ascent to an altitude of 13,000 feet, the crossing of the Atlantic in a balloon - Her long flight to the upper regions of the earth - She led the first flight of a manned airship from the United States to Europe - One of her greatest achievements in aviation was the flying of the first airship to cross over the Atlantic - She is in the vanguard of scientific research - Her pioneering flight will forever be memorized as long as a scientific spirit dominates the world - She is the first woman to cross the Atlantic - She, like Columbus, represents the spirit of the American pioneer. - The greatest gift our times can bestow upon her, is this trip to the moon. It is fitting that this should be done by one of the most accomplished scientist in the world. - It is fitting that she should be accompanied by the foremost scientist of the United States - From the moment she left the earth she has been a great pioneer in the race toward the moon.\nA woman has just been on the moon and her achievement has excited the entire nation. She was accompanied on her expedition by Mr. Scott, the great man who invented the space ship.\nShe is the first woman, on record, to go into the heavens in her own plane.\nAnd she went far up into the sky, as though it were an out of doors playground.\nThe airship, called'Columbia'is a large, bright white balloon about twenty-five feet high.\nIts construction is new and unique.\nBy means of a system of pumps and tubes, it can hold air nearly as long as a bicycle tire - five hundred and ten hours under ordinary conditions.\nIt is also self-regulating.\nThe weight of it does not greatly affect the buoyancy and altitude.\nThe'Columbia'is one of the best airships in the world, and it was built with a very long range in mind.\nIt may fly almost twelve thousand miles, or around the earth three times at the rate of twenty-eight miles per hour.

Since then we have been exchanging information to benefit both worlds. The last message was received three days ago and it read, `` They are here. Help. ''\nAfter receiving the message, i went out into a field, sat down and began praying. I got on my knees and cried out to God to help me cope with the problem. After two hours of prayer i was able to put the problem behind me for the rest of the day. I decided that i would not worry about it. I had so much to do. The next day was Memorial Day. We normally celebrate it for all the fallen soldiers and veterans of the American Revolution. I prayed again this morning with the belief my prayers could not cause any harm to our friends in the other universes and i decided not to waste any more of it.\nWhen the message came back, i asked God when it would be delivered. I waited until it said `` Now ''. I asked God for one more time to give me faith. I hoped that his message could be delivered and would have faith that the answer was still on its way. I decided to take it in my stride in the days to come. My mind was full of work that needed to be done and our anniversary celebrations to be prepared for.\nAfter the workout in the pool the night before, I sat in my room just enjoying the evening and what a beautiful evening it was. So I stayed there. But just at one o\u2019clock, I remembered the message. That one time I sat with so many people and I had that one conversation with the man next to me. And the other evening when I was swimming, the parrallel universe was there. And I was in it and we were having that conversation, and he had that idea that came through his head in the same direction, and so I remembered. But the time had come and I remembered, and I waited. And I wasn\u2019t worried. And I began again my daily routine. Not thinking that the messages would happen. It happened, and it was God and thank you.\nI love this post. It makes you think and it helps the heart and soul. Thanks for sharing and may you have many more to share. My best to you!\nThank you for sharing your experiences. The messages are a true blessing and an assurance that people can still communicate over the infinite space of the stars, if we pay close attention to their intentions.\nWhat a touching story of the Universe in action in the real world. God Bless to the author and the person who gave the message to her. I am sure that God sees the true needs of this man and that we are here to bring the message to him!\nWhen you are ready to learn about the real estate in your dream destination, or need an objective opinion about your purchase, I would be thrilled to assist you.\nDo not hesitate to contact me to schedule a time to discuss your plans with the highest of professionalism and respect.\nAs an emerging market leader, China is investing ever more in the ICT sector, where the country\u2019s top five telecom players are investing billions of dollars. However, the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy is still lagging far behind the USA, which has already passed China in capital expenditure (Capital Expenditures, or CapEx) and is in its eighth year of growth with an annual increase of more than 2% over the last decade. While it makes sense to plan for the future in times of uncertainty, the time is ripe to leverage China's rapidly growing ICT infrastructure and services with the help of an experienced partner.","token_len":754,"entropy":[6.0094,1.2084,3.9084,4.7086,1.2982,3.572,1.6988,6.6652,1.2042,2.9935,8.3539,9.0838,1.7103,3.4974,10.4451,1.3581,4.9318,0.0935,0.917,0.9946,2.125,7.9142,2.3522,4.6754,8.7211,3.1362,4.5655,0.605,3.1432,5.1911,5.3753,2.0707,3.4279,6.4449,2.1262,0.0955,1.8598,1.85,6.4729,1.7442,7.4974,10.862,1.6616,3.6967,1.4083,6.7921,3.5603,5.0684,1.9981,7.6101,2.8927,1.0343,0.5615,0.9204,6.9914,3.9835,3.7612,2.8921,3.5418,2.5711,3.0788,5.871,0.5553,1.377,3.6413,6.3805,0.6344,1.7469,4.7454,5.1945,0.9284,0.9286,0.6182,4.8843,2.9905,2.6944,1.366,3.6523,1.5742,0.4655,7.3351,0.6075,1.1792,4.3373,0.5857,3.7543,5.059,0.9928,0.9415,1.261,2.5968,1.457,1.3141,0.007,4.6563,2.1767,2.4998,1.9518,0.0223,5.217,1.6041,1.1082,0.0014,0.8356,0.2916,0.3026,1.787,4.2176,2.1813,2.1885,1.2571,3.3117,4.7805,0.2676,1.7382,2.069,1.0962,3.2727,5.5198,0.6789,1.7162,1.4077,1.9447,3.328,1.7954,0.4381,3.5651,10.0737,0.0491,1.0599,3.5142,9.4672,3.694,2.6879,4.7037,3.6108,0.8255,6.6972,3.5665,1.8899,4.0192,2.1177,0.8427,4.915,3.723,0.5767,2.3029,5.1187,4.6948,4.6286,1.1505,4.2417,1.7224,6.0693,7.859,1.5357,3.0802,4.3841,7.353,1.7491,1.3235,1.2569,3.2477,4.884,2.5722,0.8675,6.1301,4.3849,3.3877,5.0941,3.3819,4.6071,0.0022,4.5093,1.1858,1.3418,3.6606,3.6693,0.3451,1.8556,4.0422,2.2605,3.9559,1.7691,1.342,1.3595,0.9619,4.6437,2.3543,5.8831,1.8522,0.8261,0.999,5.6894,0.6241,2.9831,5.6239,1.8637,2.2906,6.1407,3.0822,6.1905,7.7722,7.861,1.6581,3.2533,1.3809,2.596,5.3843,1.3001,1.0875,1.3456,2.6872,0.5793,6.5736,1.4158,1.1282,5.7771,1.1508,4.4936,3.3884,2.2202,1.8443,1.5237,3.1557,4.4657,3.4116,5.1134,2.0713,2.3536,5.7613,1.5528,4.0231,3.5969,3.6681,0.026,0.2892,1.3242,4.346,0.6063,3.2963,2.1188,3.52,3.0933,1.6356,5.4069,1.8479,5.4769,0.9312,0.0019,0.4681,4.0512,4.8727,0.861,3.3976,0.0781,6.3899,3.7411,3.3132,0.1103,0.0928,0.0644,2.0762,7.3575,10.3762,3.5448,4.9532,0.8057,6.0407,1.2335,1.0416,1.4334,2.9111,1.9649,10.806,4.1427,0.8142,5.7647,3.7325,4.9021,0.1345,1.2985,1.6125,3.0724,1.8284,1.4383,2.5645,5.9987,5.356,0.8788,4.2154,2.6758,6.9562,2.1127,2.896,3.9375,0.3436,0.2559,0.2218,6.4939,3.079,5.7689,3.271,3.8391,5.526,5.2317,4.7165,6.124,2.7924,15.4148,6.0319,5.1196,1.6443,1.9521,5.4109,1.7895,1.4018,1.83,4.5282,4.5246,2.148,2.2887,4.478,3.1558,6.3329,0.8609,1.257,1.7482,3.1024,3.3144,5.2782,3.3349,5.5306,0.5771,2.2017,3.6074,3.7919,0.1811,0.037,0.6951,3.6737,3.1879,2.9798,7.611,3.0629,1.2489,1.5668,8.1635,2.4197,2.6812,6.2735,0.1172,0.0041,0.1591,2.7566,1.8122,2.9429,1.1077,2.4077,1.8348,2.051,3.0529,3.2338,2.6748,4.2639,1.1253,4.2718,3.1364,1.5166,3.3604,1.4468,2.7158,3.3364,2.3203,6.5058,1.7134,7.574,2.5625,3.3769,2.2612,4.5446,1.5958,3.3778,6.8906,3.2431,1.1826,3.6914,1.1401,4.8468,3.5071,3.7978,2.7497,4.4972,3.3835,0.4023,1.6883,1.4073,4.5575,3.4143,1.649,1.2902,5.7133,1.8325,1.8845,2.1907,6.0657,4.4349,1.392,0.2375,5.0904,1.4622,3.247,0.9928,5.7102,5.5498,4.6825,5.0461,3.089,0.9684,6.1908,3.6699,2.9056,2.8172,4.5933,1.2319,5.6798,4.6598,3.5043,3.7657,3.4815,0.8791,1.697,1.4359,5.8913,4.4573,8.2133,0.7209,1.7203,1.5166,1.7791,6.2754,2.4037,4.8634,1.7508,2.008,3.7741,3.8973,2.0299,3.3808,2.5054,3.4682,5.1593,7.1047,3.0683,1.5075,1.5344,5.1265,0.8175,2.085,2.7816,7.0128,1.422,2.3804,4.3011,0.9472,3.4083,1.1213,0.9418,5.305,5.4117,6.8794,0.3824,4.1204,1.0068,4.2614,0.0729,1.0591,2.2923,2.564,3.717,1.4952,4.6063,4.1999,1.8016,4.0854,6.2016,2.7823,1.8277,3.5299,7.3959,1.8349,5.1536,2.3209,3.6914,5.6056,7.2612,0.8497,6.1004,3.641,0.8247,1.3505,6.4744,2.8284,5.4039,3.0682,6.6544,2.7813,0.0273,0.8708,2.8377,4.7897,0.4772,1.4735,4.9675,3.3428,7.9807,2.7365,3.6013,3.1541,7.6188,4.5737,2.4892,4.8425,1.6447,6.1017,0.3159,0.4229,5.4909,3.441,5.3281,2.7762,5.9805,1.5691,2.3679,5.6565,0.9477,3.8234,2.2239,1.1977,2.7974,4.0709,0.7025,2.9565,2.4808,3.0543,1.8968,4.2476,6.4019,2.138,5.3798,6.0601,0.3783,3.2391,5.8133,0.8778,2.1464,3.3246,2.5317,4.9977,0.706,5.3512,2.8422,0.7411,0.789,2.3782,5.5034,1.1972,5.6971,1.749,2.1833,3.1362,0.4923,4.9693,2.3708,0.9471,3.608,9.0429,3.4032,1.5694,5.4892,7.2009,0.5295,4.3439,6.0241,3.7018,7.5643,5.688,1.6783,2.0256,5.4492,0.6897,3.1023,2.0483,2.9988,4.3804,0.2272,3.6464,0.361,1.0527,1.725,5.5617,1.7859,1.2671,0.1599,0.8939,0.2006,3.6862,3.1874,1.0658,3.7982,0.9034,3.4351,0.8122,3.905,1.828,2.3542,7.398,4.2387,7.3339,1.7809,3.9811,0.3486,1.413,4.5578,2.9207,8.9332,2.7784,2.7418,0.8211,6.6174,0.935,6.296,8.4605,0.564,0.5606,1.9765,8.1148,1.5114,1.3786,1.9925,4.6274,2.1743,4.9823,10.0927,1.4469,2.202,5.1505,3.9182,7.4913,4.4072,0.9503,2.8375,3.2308,0.5499,0.1328,2.0734,4.6271,0.099,2.031,3.7943,2.9473,0.2251,0.0151,5.0664,2.5503,2.973,0.0007,4.2169,1.0614,1.8327,5.3056,0.0268,4.4341,0.0015,1.8942,4.0729,1.8724,2.3926,1.5355,3.8099,6.0843,3.4708,1.9404,6.6666,2.2531,3.764,7.2503,1.001,1.1578,3.2534,2.3273,7.2849,1.9311,1.0785,1.8124,2.0164,2.7711,4.8139,4.7012,0.3165,0.3042,1.5312,5.4864,2.5784,1.6256,5.9541,0.2456,3.4655,0.0285,2.763,1.4759,2.7807,0.5934,1.123,2.0371,0.165,4.3059,3.9244,5.627,0.4479,0.9

{"prompt":"In your society everyone is born with the number 100 on their wrist , and every time they do something bad , the number decreases in proportion to the severity of the action . You 've just shoplifted , and now your number is 0 .","text":"In your society everyone is born with the number 100 on their wrist, and every time they do something bad, the number decreases in proportion to the severity of the action. You've just shoplifted, and now your number is 0. This number can get very low, and if someone steals your things and kills you, you will be dead.\nYour boss has ordered you to sell some stock. He is prepared to kill you if you don't, the number will be 20. What will you do?\nI don't think you have a choice. He has the right to force your services. Do you have another job?\nHe is planning to kill you, it isn't a game. The only way to survive is to do what he tells you to do. You have to accept the contract or die. He might ask to sell goods he doesn't want to sell, so be ready for the unexpected.\nWhat is the probability that you will be caught shoplifting?\nWell, this depends on how many people are watching you and they might start to watch others as well, so the probability is that you don't steal anything as long as you keep your pants up.\nIf you take your pants off, then the probability is that someone sees it. The chance of getting caught then is 100%.\nWhat would you do if they caught you doing something more serious?\nIn my opinion you have to deal with this immediately. In most occasions people will try and cover up the situation and tell you things that won't incriminate you, but I don't think you can trust them, so it's better to get a proper lawyer who can handle this. They will try and convince you to drop charges and get off scot free.\nIn my opinion everyone has the right to defend themselves. If you get injured on the job you must call the police and seek legal assistance.\nIs it OK to be gay if you're not prepared to change it?\nThe only way you can prove that you are a lesbian or gay is by showing you are open to change your sexual orientation. There have been many cases where people have changed their sexual orientation following a positive life experience like being accepted in a work place. But if you can't change your sexual orientation, then you are less likely to be accepted in society and might be subject to bullying and persecution.\nWhat do you think happens to gay people if they refuse help?\nIn my opinion society is becoming more accepting, but you need to accept that people in authority have a right to discriminate against gay people. However, I think it's a good idea not to refuse help because people will look down on you if you do, as you are going to feel like a failure if you try to hide your sexuality because you don't want to be labelled a lesbian or gay.\nWhat if the police are called to investigate a crime or incident and it turns out it was you who committed the crime?\nDo you think they will try and blame you, or will they understand that's an ordinary mistake, and let you go?\nIt depends what crime they caught you committing. If it was a minor crime you could be sentenced to a fine, but if it was a murder or terrorism you could face the possibility of a lot more trouble.

{"prompt":"Your perception of time affects the progression of time","text":"Your perception of time affects the progression of time itself on your timeline. In many cases, time traveling will be the goal of our characters.\nTo be able to influence time, you will need to be able to control light and dark. A great example of this is finding a way to use a light barrier that will prevent time from progressing. This is just as much the enemy as the protagonist, for it is the first thing time travelers will attempt to counter to prevent you from traveling through the past. The more you can control the way light passes through, the better time traveling will be.\nThe only way to make light travel is to create a barrier around the objects you wish to transport. The more tightly held the barrier, the less chance that light will pass through it. The less light your barrier lets through, the more time travelers will have to expend effort.\nOne way to ensure the light barrier will stay up while you travel through time would be by binding time to the lights. Time is just as much a force as light and darkness. Whenever the lights change shape or position, time changes accordingly as well. This could be achieved by making the barrier invisible and locking the lights to the barrier. However, this is not possible for this game since it would require a very large number of lighting bars and would take up a lot of space in the game, which is already very small.\nThis is one of the major advantages of the time traveling system in the game. By making the lights visible and allowing them to move around, the system could potentially be more efficient and easier on the player. This is because more light barriers could be created without having to constantly track the lights. Using a larger amount of light barriers may allow the protagonist to travel past them without having to spend substantial time trying to make sure they will stay up.\nTo prevent time traveling, another option would be to create a force field or barrier that will make time travel impossible. But this will also make most things inaccessible, including the gates that are typically at the most common locations to traverse through time like the past. Furthermore, this option would also make life in general quite inconvenient for the main character. It would also prevent most of the objects from moving, which prevents the protagonist from simply teleporting things through time.\nThis is another great advantage of making certain objects invisible. It is possible to create an infinite number of invisible barriers so long as there are an infinite number of lights. When it comes down to it, if the lights are visible and can move freely, they will make the barrier more or less permanent. However, making the lights invisible prevents time travel since it leaves no way for the barrier to remain open unless you force them to stay visible by locking the lighting bars to the objects.\nFor this reason, the best way to prevent time traveling from occurring is to make certain objects invisible whenever time traveling will not occur. This is exactly what the game does. Whenever the time traveling object isn\u2019t around, there are no barriers that prevent time travel to occur.\nThis is how the game\u2019s time system works and how it works with the barriers and objects in a way which allows one to travel through temporal barriers. There are some differences between the game\u2019s system and the one in the series, but these are generally minor.\nOn the first page, I mentioned that time travel in the series took place in the future, but the game went from that to the past rather fast, using a time travel system which was largely the same. In the game, time travel takes place in the past, even by the end of the game. The only notable difference between the game and the series is whether time travel occurs in the past or the future.","token_len":758,"entropy":[9.5772,0.5635,5.4442,7.6975,1.6332,6.8797,0.1672,4.3985,3.5923,6.8073,2.842,3.6312,0.5461,3.5104,4.4804,0.9141,0.3752,2.4958,7.0613,2.8101,2.0728,2.5652,5.5411,0.8572,5.6961,4.6991,1.0902,1.7831,10.2426,3.1974,1.8925,0.0022,6.3063,2.3961,1.3647,1.2047,2.5462,0.2527,0.2926,2.2949,0.5017,0.0042,3.2728,8.3586,1.5708,1.6109,1.5942,4.5079,4.6999,1.2286,0.3183,0.3828,0.3496,7.9582,1.8795,1.3596,0.1033,3.283,2.5374,2.3937,7.4262,2.6833,2.5934,3.2061,2.705,2.0699,5.3016,1.207,2.3382,1.8036,5.2732,2.0147,3.9786,3.8071,7.3148,0.8564,0.8048,4.4242,1.5517,5.2267,3.1118,1.8652,1.7925,5.0469,2.2451,7.6165,2.4152,1.5988,5.75,0.1839,5.7181,5.2083,4.1718,3.9124,0.203,3.4108,2.8068,2.0951,3.5228,0.2859,3.1657,4.3045,1.459,2.3861,0.4305,1.5986,5.903,1.6532,3.1191,0.3322,1.389,0.0459,2.1872,4.614,2.4617,0.8671,0.3401,0.2834,0.5353,2.498,4.8164,1.2246,0.511,3.9055,2.9246,0.9739,5.5293,0.8829,2.9562,0.7222,2.6196,3.6282,1.404,6.442,0.8067,4.0316,0.0184,5.8599,0.6371,2.4806,3.2321,8.8458,5.4714,2.1279,0.7473,2.0816,0.0172,2.5385,4.7644,2.9943,1.4051,0.3123,1.0845,0.1372,1.0509,0.3462,2.4122,3.5294,3.1363,4.2262,5.6679,6.6108,2.0028,0.1582,0.017,1.5113,0.5751,3.1518,0.1722,2.1657,0.2243,6.8241,6.0593,3.8523,0.9395,4.1315,1.9429,0.283,4.8068,2.9262,4.5803,2.2109,2.7345,2.6579,4.3723,4.3886,1.1812,0.6602,1.0761,0.4565,5.1945,0.0178,2.603,8.7714,4.8944,2.0019,2.0642,7.2097,1.6884,4.9194,3.0222,4.2435,2.5939,1.9823,1.1912,4.2344,1.9121,1.7623,3.078,3.2476,0.9079,6.3172,2.6691,4.0355,4.4545,5.0991,2.573,6.0753,0.283,2.8586,3.1788,5.6897,4.2135,0.2346,0.1701,2.7297,5.0299,0.6729,4.2435,0.4253,3.6402,1.6505,3.0928,4.2966,2.5338,5.7158,1.5044,3.2572,1.6364,1.144,4.6045,0.6939,4.6214,0.0286,1.8429,1.6147,1.4611,3.1137,3.1251,4.8185,3.9417,3.5987,1.9123,2.4868,1.3131,2.1726,3.4768,1.7614,2.3228,0.0105,6.5383,7.9276,2.6122,3.8303,2.9414,3.9709,2.0267,0.7595,0.0182,1.607,2.7489,0.6718,0.73,3.7737,2.0899,1.2692,6.1776,2.7343,3.9746,0.6276,0.6425,3.4042,1.3916,3.107,0.4356,0.2519,3.4605,4.1453,0.2191,1.7346,3.5228,1.6144,1.1849,2.9423,2.0172,1.8482,0.3492,4.5744,2.7316,1.1472,4.3336,4.0548,1.5596,3.1407,1.4421,0.0268,1.3014,1.923,1.1296,1.9835,4.9097,4.5818,4.8951,2.2459,2.5292,2.0893,1.8678,3.4262,3.7321,0.6962,0.6603,0.482,2.575,1.1907,2.3745,6.4504,2.2118,6.2674,2.7828,0.4415,1.2716,5.0926,2.1389,0.0637,4.3266,4.8907,1.4357,3.5932,1.1654,5.6469,1.8359,6.4267,2.2534,0.0374,0.6965,1.7828,4.5793,3.536,1.9146,5.1917,0.2172,1.7538,4.7584,4.5793,2.5775,1.2016,0.0161,3.6221,7.5509,1.0603,3.2911,0.0376,4.202,2.5976,1.0133,4.5542,2.9857,1.8142,0.7868,0.5663,4.2102,3.9871,1.927,1.3697,0.7582,7.9694,3.3077,1.3171,0.0144,0.2785,1.7278,0.6639,6.3784,0.1391,4.1948,3.4338,1.4462,1.9362,3.7364,2.3729,0.5242,2.3988,0.275,6.5762,1.2162,2.9062,4.0172,3.1645,6.5563,3.683,7.0088,2.4276,4.5861,1.5872,8.669,2.4819,3.1435,6.1735,5.521,0.285,5.9705,4.3284,1.1907,4.0547,6.5061,3.1936,1.1036,7.5688,1.0559,3.0502,0.9337,6.3873,0.0178,2.0723,4.5539,1.1671,2.3021,2.2361,5.4644,4.0787,4.9265,4.2374,6.4096,1.2345,0.929,4.4846,0.7675,0.731,3.4632,1.1098,1.238,3.4552,3.7123,1.4802,0.2144,5.5316,3.1426,2.1557,2.4327,1.8856,6.788,1.3153,2.5843,0.0846,5.2665,6.9634,0.0037,6.2471,2.5724,0.184,0.4473,0.4466,2.494,1.285,3.1369,3.4052,1.0519,0.2165,4.72,5.7715,0.6521,2.0687,1.0531,2.8289,1.7043,1.9567,0.6071,1.3198,2.5277,4.1761,0.6415,0.0054,3.4882,2.7208,4.7921,3.4444,0.0138,3.1167,0.6764,5.6123,0.1497,0.1039,0.0118,2.7974,2.3498,4.5207,4.0468,0.1848,3.7923,0.0032,0.2647,0.2277,4.4769,1.5009,4.548,0.8971,3.8147,2.4335,4.1753,1.5978,3.4863,0.6015,2.0033,1.4575,4.038,2.0004,5.5679,3.675,4.5655,0.0011,5.0766,0.2278,2.0963,0.0192,5.296,1.3245,2.975,1.088,5.5996,2.5446,0.3896,5.0341,1.3934,5.3908,2.1593,2.2279,0.6136,0.6094,9.4586,0.0349,4.5223,3.4081,6.1248,1.6901,3.2723,2.313,0.3388,2.9903,5.2546,4.1701,4.1855,1.099,5.0182,1.8699,1.5727,0.6511,5.8496,0.403,0.7799,4.7265,2.3401,0.4782,0.0964,1.9832,3.8314,0.5016,0.1017,2.4445,0.6137,1.8732,5.8052,2.9406,0.2635,0.5068,1.8466,3.6499,0.3293,0.7781,6.6892,4.9368,5.5389,5.3936,4.5157,1.1051,0.1339,1.6456,1.316,5.8193,0.5105,1.6554,2.3511,0.8624,1.468,5.4672,1.5766,2.163,2.7427,3.8446,6.6629,18.3306,7.5646,2.489,4.6505,0.7183,4.0729,2.3832,1.2996,3.5351,2.3874,2.83,1.6275,0.4199,4.5223,0.2374,0.2917,1.6642,2.7968,1.0436,4.5051,1.158,1.1459,18.0024,0.5248,0.1719,2.2974,4.8106,0.463,4.1991,2.1023,0.6916,1.9054,2.4594,1.7732,8.2812,3.0066,2.4476,2.2164,4.9588,2.4362,4.5645,2.6067,5.2962,0.1586,2.2627,0.7176,10.0378,5.9232,1.1885,4.571,0.3618,3.8218,4.8243,0.6017,0.8714,2.2167,4.3203,0.0804,0.0528,3.4043,0.2056,0.6631,3.7009,2.0537,1.2938,4.9167,1.6917,0.7467,2.5953,0.8276,4.8,2.607,1.1296,0.5415,5.8796,0.4422,4.2491,1.8363,1.8353,2.5214,2.5269,0.6931,2.1597,0.6872,3.678,0.7124,1.2772,5.366,0.2203,1.132,1.2133,2.1847,1.7711,1.5993,1.9743,1.5668,5.0705,3.634,2.8283,1.4102,1.0022,4.339,6.4313,5.7274,2.4964,6.4467,2.1357,2.6326,1.8028,0.3607,1.2874,2.3318,5.9292,3.4486,0.1473,1.8346,2.7312,0.7745,1.598,0.3567,1

{"prompt":"After killing 3 home invaders you collapse to your kitchen floor , on the television you hear reports of a strong hallucinogenic being released by a terrorist group","text":"After killing 3 home invaders you collapse to your kitchen floor, on the television you hear reports of a strong hallucinogenic being released by a terrorist group in the middle of the night. When you see the face of the terrorist you see its head was cut off and you hear people saying \u2018the terrorists are on our side\u2019. When you wake up you find there is a new version of you and an empty television at your home.\nThe terrorists release the poison all over the planet, you are now in a new version of a new war, but you don\u2019t know what war, or how you found out of the new war you found a video game program on your TV screen, where you find you are the world leader. You fight against the terrorist groups that kill your troops. Your troops are out for revenge because they have to fight terrorists they are fighting over killing the terrorists. They have to kill the terrorists before they kill them. You and your troops are out for revenge and are fighting over whether you kill terrorists or terrorists kill you.\nWe are in the future where drones are released by the terrorists over the planet for the purpose of killing terrorists. You, as world leader, are about to enter the war zone but you will not be able to stop the drones. You and your troops will face the end of your wars. The drones are released across the planet when they are given the signal they are about to explode. You and your troops have to go get the terrorists before they can get the drones. You have to avoid the explosions as well so that you may not die. If you die the terrorists win.\nA drone is coming towards you, your mission is to avoid the explosion, the missile will explode when it gets close to you. Then you and your troops have to avoid the drone, if it explodes you will go into the drone and you are dead as well. Then you have to wait for the drones to get close to you then you have to shoot the drones.\nYou have just woken up and there is an old, weak man trying to tell you that you are in a hotel room where most of the rooms have been hit with drones. Drones are not that easy to kill and you are dying of thirst. The people inside the hotel are dying because they keep giving you water. When you take enough water you find the door is locked so you don\u2019t have to go into the room. Now you have to save the remaining people. You have to save their lives, you have to go and open the door. You now face the person in charge of the hotel telling you that drones are killing the people inside all the rooms. The person also tells you that there is one weak man who is trying to get the firemen to save him. If you save the man you are able to open the door, but you have to go and save at least 1 person and try to save everyone on the other 3 floors.\nYou go into a room to see if you can get anyone out and find there are people left alive. You go back to the firemen who have fallen unconscious and find they lost an arm in the hotel and now are looking for medical help. You find a drone at the hospital on fire and kill it. You then find a room with the weakest person there and now go to save the person and his father who has fallen unconscious. You find there is water for the weakest person there as well, but the door to the next floor is locked.

{"prompt":"You regularly take a pill that allows you to host the conscience of your dead SO .","text":"You regularly take a pill that allows you to host the conscience of your dead SO. You constantly need new souls, so you can always be a person (you cannot die).\nThe dead keep the soul, not the body. Once, the soul was inside the body of a pig. The pig kept the soul and not the body. If the dead, once the time has come, can no longer feel pain, are less dependent on the body. The dead don\u2019t need to eat and so they will not die from hunger. The dead are at peace, and they do not fear suffering.\nThere are also souls without bodies, but they are not living. They don\u2019t move and their eyes do not shine when they are dead. They still exist, however, and some see them on their deathbed.\nAs long as you don\u2019t eat, you will not become a spirit without a body, and the body will not give you energy for eating.\nI had to kill (but really did it), because I knew it would be the only way to get rid of something I didn\u2019t want to see anymore, and yet it\u2019s not so bad\nI see those souls that would have been born with a face, who now exist in the form of a soul without a body.\nI don\u2019t think that someone who wants to kill us knows where we are at any time we want him to know, especially with a device like this. And I do not think he will go on the internet and search for us on the basis of his soul number.\nWhat happens to the dead when they no longer have their bodies is like something out of science-fiction movies. And this is just a short explanation of that \u2013 I saw a lot of different films with different stories, so I think all this will happen, but still it seems to me that in our world there is so much evil.\nNo, in my opinion the soul of the dead doesn\u2019t really live. However, it doesn\u2019t seem that the soul of the dead will be destroyed, but the soul of the living, and then it will exist as a different spirit.\nNo, it won\u2019t. It would be much harder for us to die if we did not have consciousness. This will be the time and the only way for it to end completely, to stop our existence.\nSome people say it is a form of suicide. That is a lie. The dead have no desire to die anymore, so it is simply a way to be able to leave our own body. Therefore, the dead want to do something different with their own body, and it is that kind of desire \u2013 they would like to live without a body. There is nothing wrong with this thought.\nNo, the souls of the dead will no longer have a body, and they will exist as a part of other people. In my opinion, it seems a bit weird, but there are people who choose to live with their beloved dead for as long as they can. Therefore, the life of an old man is not as lonely as we think. There are more people, it seems to me, who have chosen to be alone than there are people who choose not to be.\nYes yes \u2026\u2026 The soul is very much alive, and with it we live forever. When someone dies, the body turns into ash, and the soul goes on living.\nI do not know whether he is a ghost or not. We were talking about dead people before. He doesn\u2019t have a body and so does not have a face. It seems to me a very weird and unusual thing if a person lives without a body.","token_len":761,"entropy":[9.3973,4.9969,2.0549,7.2234,2.8761,4.7866,0.2686,0.0219,11.9221,3.5154,12.9704,1.8331,0.9782,7.2624,12.4694,3.5342,2.7584,7.2626,4.2014,6.3612,6.0911,2.4447,2.9274,1.3485,2.5165,4.9172,3.3041,3.1125,5.385,5.9887,3.7633,5.2442,4.367,2.2327,1.9374,6.2741,6.9783,5.9457,2.466,3.1713,2.371,3.9416,0.5859,1.3581,0.5224,5.8423,4.8526,2.9178,1.6578,0.9931,5.4915,1.7422,0.5569,1.4884,1.0537,7.3727,1.1049,1.892,0.7009,3.1528,0.8072,0.9926,2.9907,4.9235,0.1177,0.5121,0.4134,3.9148,1.5099,3.3995,5.7608,5.7933,2.8566,7.9063,2.1838,1.389,0.7543,2.8183,2.4013,0.0097,4.7684,2.6793,0.4827,5.628,5.9199,6.0826,0.1385,0.9574,0.9646,3.1055,1.9174,2.5308,3.822,16.4538,8.0499,0.6423,1.7765,0.6384,4.249,2.9028,6.1208,1.8342,3.8083,1.6451,3.3047,4.2982,1.5249,0.6873,1.7205,1.7434,2.3673,6.4067,1.1448,2.2497,1.9267,2.139,2.7403,0.0976,4.26,4.9155,0.4838,1.4954,3.9316,0.8871,3.6334,3.9694,5.5498,2.7855,1.2826,1.7732,1.4271,1.0898,1.3542,4.4582,1.0654,1.5077,3.1962,0.1131,0.1293,0.029,6.0169,2.8291,3.6798,3.6858,1.8077,0.0142,4.9798,4.2584,0.4241,1.1557,2.4719,0.1858,1.4207,5.0077,4.0202,1.2683,4.521,0.6413,1.3797,5.3268,6.2706,0.7942,5.6187,1.5537,3.1102,0.5559,0.8025,1.235,4.7379,2.64,0.0062,1.342,2.8937,0.0603,0.0642,0.0168,2.8991,1.3088,1.3515,1.8367,1.4513,3.5823,1.1061,4.4408,5.9631,1.208,1.3128,2.3232,1.2979,3.0989,2.0048,0.9012,1.3913,4.2917,0.3175,3.6642,3.7222,4.7631,0.4114,1.3666,4.1258,5.2016,2.6371,4.0884,7.1018,5.7613,7.4035,3.3724,2.2239,2.4273,2.1358,0.9057,4.1588,2.5834,1.0983,1.6703,2.9329,2.9654,0.3142,0.7864,2.4044,1.7311,0.0057,5.9462,2.2195,1.8831,0.0846,0.0372,0.0485,1.0348,0.836,3.1126,5.5866,2.6908,1.2881,5.6309,2.7279,2.994,0.0137,2.1007,2.4104,4.2619,1.6434,5.3619,1.7752,5.7413,5.3142,2.5336,3.1981,5.4337,3.2091,1.8704,4.5722,2.1513,1.5112,5.3344,1.8421,3.9677,5.3817,5.3197,1.8094,1.5161,3.4509,0.0518,1.2956,4.2984,4.6945,0.3673,0.8655,0.7795,1.2184,1.6665,3.073,0.0626,0.0164,0.0034,2.6742,1.5752,6.0313,1.3288,3.9809,0.1129,2.7575,5.9725,6.653,4.1506,1.1723,0.869,5.485,3.8658,2.23,7.5496,3.1316,5.8596,0.463,5.5249,1.9869,5.6279,3.8817,2.2474,9.5161,1.5283,0.75,0.6012,5.1691,1.6637,3.2362,0.3588,0.6117,1.7742,2.3027,4.864,3.4199,4.3934,4.1003,1.5021,5.3257,0.3155,0.8887,4.7346,1.3064,6.0989,0.1821,3.2146,5.0355,9.3883,0.7268,0.696,4.2748,4.1865,1.7299,1.6197,2.1851,1.783,0.5548,4.7636,0.0167,1.3981,4.0344,2.7604,6.2506,5.0377,5.2147,1.2704,0.0133,5.4136,6.1806,0.0051,4.7002,0.6847,4.8096,4.0441,0.6875,3.3303,2.1855,5.2309,3.9777,1.1784,3.9623,7.286,2.3784,6.2856,1.728,2.8209,0.0681,5.395,5.0339,3.1792,1.5078,4.9559,1.5413,2.7313,0.5884,3.4115,5.3462,2.9934,3.6384,2.9244,3.2731,1.1237,6.1516,2.586,4.0706,1.692,1.2445,0.4349,4.4188,4.7645,2.193,2.4044,0.795,3.6352,0.1414,5.3915,2.0453,0.8839,5.6076,1.7865,4.8182,2.3199,2.362,2.8241,4.0468,3.3342,1.2201,0.5269,3.9586,0.1495,0.0822,0.0056,3.8023,4.4988,1.1564,5.5007,0.1879,2.2905,3.248,0.0881,0.0333,0.0866,4.7239,2.3601,2.2144,1.424,1.0599,0.259,0.3692,3.3002,2.4349,4.6585,2.3176,2.7966,2.4691,1.4374,0.2829,0.2408,1.0923,3.7257,2.5832,4.9135,2.9742,0.5003,5.8523,2.6024,0.6215,4.4287,4.4887,0.9216,0.816,4.6109,0.3616,2.4611,2.9398,1.0526,0.0276,0.2767,1.7503,1.8459,3.7549,1.334,4.0275,3.4847,1.4998,2.0119,0.2615,3.9296,2.0142,0.718,2.8893,0.9589,0.8919,8.2702,0.7865,4.3515,3.2045,1.7025,1.9959,4.4714,5.7179,2.9368,8.0358,0.8613,2.2855,4.6501,0.0477,5.1571,8.1535,1.8859,5.1497,3.9967,3.5496,1.9436,0.6369,0.5895,5.4543,1.0808,2.4877,3.1185,0.8951,2.8397,4.7545,0.0972,4.6543,1.5213,3.0126,0.5461,2.4414,1.9292,0.6262,2.8855,3.6981,2.6406,1.2541,4.3017,0.2247,1.3419,5.7836,1.0397,2.2928,2.3901,0.7986,4.9286,1.0357,2.649,0.7231,4.3643,3.1603,0.0032,4.4624,3.4964,3.4549,1.7142,0.8442,5.6928,0.4495,2.3051,2.594,4.9004,0.1828,4.1877,2.2124,3.4843,3.2529,0.5095,2.6952,1.5342,1.0968,1.3333,2.767,0.5897,4.6538,3.488,0.0007,3.9929,5.6961,3.5995,3.9551,1.4264,0.1959,2.9435,2.5979,1.9395,0.6776,0.7704,4.9031,0.8781,2.4481,1.2021,0.0713,1.8462,6.7846,1.1505,0.695,4.0909,0.2224,2.0197,3.7539,0.9214,0.2082,0.1572,2.8255,4.7303,0.011,2.1159,1.8193,1.4738,1.0558,1.2743,1.3408,0.3803,6.5272,0.8385,0.9214,6.6442,0.0355,6.0461,1.9361,1.6835,3.9129,2.5148,0.5553,0.4358,2.7823,4.7701,4.619,3.5227,3.6941,2.2954,1.072,2.9165,1.6747,2.4069,0.627,5.3712,0.2742,1.23,1.8954,1.7962,8.0049,3.8167,4.1433,3.6918,0.0112,0.0085,0.4668,1.0881,0.9462,5.2414,0.2123,2.443,5.0223,0.7403,4.3063,3.0603,2.3177,1.3995,1.9502,3.1351,5.6382,0.1702,5.261,1.3235,0.8058,3.8686,0.9614,4.5926,0.7247,4.5991,5.1788,0.9082,3.665,0.072,0.2567,0.4058,3.212,3.3484,0.2236,3.6259,5.5254,4.1626,2.0695,0.304,0.7307,0.2071,1.2788,3.7642,0.011,0.954,3.4904,0.5767,4.6977,8.7483,6.7074,5.5932,4.872,2.4078,2.7512,4.4091,2.7542,0.76,1.3659,1.2988,5.7054,1.1349,2.6959,3.0153,3.7981,0.3158,5.0084,4.5201,1.0039,0.4608,1.866,1.7794,5.9089,0.788,6.9853,1.1246,0.5597,1.4431,0.7532,3.54,2.0232,3.9059,0.9275,1.194,2.2757,3.4322,0.2317,1.4593,3.2703,4.8408,1.8627,2.5969,2.6816,0.3354,0.688,1.0625,4.6097,5.14

{"prompt":"An unsuspecting person unwittingly gives `` the signal '' to a member of a secret organisation","text":"An unsuspecting person unwittingly gives `` the signal '' to a member of a secret organisation. He is then arrested along with a colleague and is taken to an undisclosed location. The police discover he has told their secrets to them, and he is then tortured in a way that will keep them submissive to the programme. He is also monitored regularly by the police and by being forced to submit to painful testing he learns about the aims and methods of the Secret Service, and the motives of his captors, who he discovers are British agents. Throughout the action of this book the reader is kept in suspense as to what actually happens. The language of this novel is also highly sophisticated and contains a variety of scientific and medical terms. It is very well written and will be appreciated by those who are serious about spy stories.\n(See also 'Stalking and Doppleganger' by Charles H. Wright, published in the June 1942 issue of British Intelligence Magazine.)\nI really enjoy listening to music as soon as it comes out or is in the ether. If I am in a particular mood I\u2019m listening\u2026 and I can usually detect what genre or artists may fit.\nFor those around here that are jazz fans or love that jazz, you can take a look at this jazz radio streaming service. It\u2019s pretty fantastic. There are many artists that I\u2019ve found and listened to on a regular basis\u2026 in fact there is a lot of amazing music out there. A lot of bands have jazz or blues based music that I love and often I am the only (or if lucky only a few) who realize the genre. But, there are some other ones that you will just have to find and if you\u2019re not familiar with either jazz or blues check out some of those too.\nThis is a website for a college in Oregon that offers a jazz section that includes many jazz classics. This is a very good resource for people that like jazz music and for those that don\u2019t they will find more than a little to like about it here.\nIf you aren\u2019t on the radio and are still interested in jazz check out Pandora which has a jazz playlists.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more important thing than learning something new. You never know when you\u2019re going to need a new skill.\u201d\nA bit of a spoiler alert for the episode I will be writing in a few days\u2026 but to save you time go and watch that movie, it is fantastic. It\u2019s not on Netflix but you can find an easier way to have it in your hands instead of downloading it. My only recommendation, don\u2019t watch it with children (unless you know they are adults) because it\u2019s not very kid friendly. The movie is a bit disturbing and some scenes will keep you from sleeping the next night. But, if you are looking for something that will keep you awake an hour and a half you should check it out. There may be another one\u2026 I\u2019ve heard that a few friends have seen that movie again and again. So, I suppose you could see it again.\nI think I\u2019ve discovered the best thing to ever happen to me. We have an amazing new feature called Google Books. I have just returned from an amazingly long vacation. I hope you are all enjoying your week. I\u2019ve missed visiting all of you, it has been a while. I was with family that lives in Florida, it was lovely and I made some wonderful memories there. I am feeling very much refreshed after this vacation, it is almost as though it has refreshed my soul. I can\u2019t even imagine how long it will be until I do some writing again.","token_len":763,"entropy":[11.7755,3.5769,9.4548,4.6663,15.8433,8.1082,7.7767,5.3181,2.0979,1.7005,5.4029,0.0603,2.3037,4.952,5.3792,1.8823,4.6874,2.4295,3.0222,5.1108,7.1861,0.0688,3.3197,4.7516,1.3391,3.1622,3.4695,0.3799,2.8925,2.9992,0.5814,0.9241,1.5558,3.2475,5.6131,3.5104,1.1993,7.549,3.809,6.1473,1.7298,4.4755,1.681,1.0637,2.8732,0.5321,2.2428,4.9901,2.9708,1.0939,5.6885,0.7094,3.1721,4.4372,0.9066,8.8328,0.9553,1.8926,1.3195,6.371,0.6519,3.0367,0.5767,3.4485,6.6889,6.0787,0.7754,1.3198,2.1609,1.8363,5.1697,8.4397,3.7412,0.172,5.4257,0.1258,6.4988,6.8916,8.039,5.3526,2.6356,2.5311,7.4583,1.1214,1.5996,0.2439,0.5464,7.6011,2.8241,2.641,1.2915,2.3021,5.6842,1.0156,2.6043,5.5057,0.0084,2.994,2.5437,4.2905,5.5039,1.3075,9.951,3.6044,0.7936,6.4682,0.8251,8.0184,3.3237,1.8495,3.1362,2.3328,2.6522,0.9443,5.0536,1.0992,3.6484,1.9494,2.2424,1.1902,4.9937,2.6325,2.2049,1.9063,7.8889,0.9719,1.9555,2.0297,0.6331,4.9055,3.7221,3.7062,1.3945,4.9322,2.2785,3.601,0.0032,6.6147,1.2037,4.3706,3.1927,1.6055,2.4221,0.6276,4.0353,2.2822,0.9516,0.7965,4.657,2.1946,3.6908,0.6551,2.2514,0.5288,1.5232,6.1288,0.1473,7.2975,4.3411,0.4935,2.1874,8.0786,6.1802,1.6792,3.9507,5.8786,4.8759,2.6611,8.3025,2.7763,1.856,0.129,0.971,0.9863,4.7476,4.0007,1.0385,5.7905,1.6452,2.6907,0.9282,2.7394,5.8769,5.8303,0.1597,0.2715,4.5701,3.1599,2.364,1.5567,1.0465,4.5629,6.165,3.2418,6.2756,0.0377,7.3131,3.4734,5.8018,0.0275,1.7026,1.9934,1.2132,5.7257,3.8552,4.3853,1.5533,8.2047,0.5362,3.9828,1.5735,2.3622,3.5663,1.2023,5.3175,3.0318,1.4798,20.8892,7.24,3.0517,3.2398,8.9444,3.8944,1.4232,2.6693,6.0798,4.8875,3.3702,8.4918,2.605,6.7019,5.728,6.9618,2.735,2.2963,4.7551,1.981,9.2469,4.5316,4.2485,1.4766,8.7367,2.7766,2.1009,6.4976,4.8657,2.6314,2.3823,3.0427,1.981,4.7868,1.1187,1.2707,0.1393,2.2143,6.1965,5.5313,9.7688,1.0568,1.313,1.6857,8.8491,0.9709,0.5077,3.5279,5.4748,1.0689,3.7047,0.6436,2.4035,4.4546,1.6005,1.9955,3.7175,0.2669,1.5185,3.1847,3.8683,3.5807,0.011,2.3625,3.4032,0.8833,0.0031,4.7373,5.444,1.0011,2.6906,1.7155,1.17,3.5074,0.6802,5.8406,1.8476,2.3577,0.0303,0.952,4.8126,1.8544,0.0783,4.7882,2.8059,8.9714,4.5247,2.5822,4.3465,2.4366,2.5928,1.3471,3.9162,2.1535,5.8671,3.4144,3.9897,5.0449,0.6547,8.9946,2.3859,7.1972,8.6019,6.9946,4.7912,0.9134,0.1364,2.1793,7.9539,2.6037,5.9805,2.0998,4.2703,3.2167,2.7005,0.6762,2.0987,2.9514,5.822,0.5212,3.6282,2.6525,4.9118,1.4777,0.0108,3.1218,2.4645,7.8674,0.298,5.9149,0.2464,2.4769,2.5724,3.239,0.1504,6.9682,4.2875,0.0983,0.4311,5.8057,0.3279,3.3661,0.3155,4.136,5.9262,0.2953,1.0171,3.5941,1.2211,1.2446,5.6866,2.2081,4.0473,8.4326,4.0493,6.1624,1.6409,2.801,2.0607,5.5474,5.6364,3.1678,3.0034,3.6115,2.803,6.2502,1.0705,3.3664,1.2176,1.3103,2.9476,1.828,2.95,0.8588,3.2973,2.3607,3.9469,1.9906,2.356,1.4482,4.5848,0.9382,0.8885,1.9034,1.145,0.4742,0.0129,5.626,4.4741,1.0364,5.0564,1.9265,1.0026,1.935,4.4928,5.1251,2.9711,1.3641,5.5179,0.6423,1.0556,3.0512,0.1231,5.8725,0.1671,0.168,0.004,5.1458,0.8217,6.2008,2.8023,2.5239,3.9756,1.2168,0.2981,2.6743,5.4962,0.1324,10.1696,5.0429,1.5954,1.1733,3.3304,6.8973,1.4417,1.9719,1.2392,7.7971,5.9718,6.2931,3.6503,0.0968,0.1577,4.0957,4.3008,6.2472,2.7077,1.5676,4.7831,3.0253,0.9916,1.2181,3.3633,4.9788,0.1664,1.6668,0.7891,4.8793,0.1606,4.7559,0.2508,0.0096,5.2721,2.0569,1.2695,7.3782,1.6462,6.965,5.2928,0.8698,4.1736,5.6461,0.528,2.1728,5.8077,4.2192,2.178,3.149,7.9099,4.5303,4.1309,1.1556,3.8392,3.4302,2.5033,1.7142,1.0329,3.2687,2.1866,5.1817,4.8527,0.4643,1.7308,5.4332,2.1727,2.2573,3.3368,4.2225,3.6063,2.4535,1.2023,6.5525,0.5105,2.4928,1.7416,0.1111,0.0286,3.887,5.6475,2.9782,1.244,1.5378,0.9224,3.0632,5.726,7.2311,0.3322,0.4279,6.9041,1.546,3.807,0.4795,5.4688,6.3195,0.8678,2.8846,0.5384,1.4156,6.0326,3.6279,3.1222,4.7949,5.3406,0.5249,0.106,0.0012,2.4039,0.6672,5.8117,5.3948,4.3893,3.2124,0.492,4.217,3.0778,0.8701,5.2929,1.7295,1.9023,1.108,1.5645,0.025,0.0556,2.194,3.5268,7.8729,0.3274,0.6169,3.6223,2.066,0.7894,2.3456,2.0556,5.25,1.5157,3.7217,3.5279,4.2644,6.0798,0.2191,1.7093,5.8297,5.9751,2.1865,0.943,0.6565,2.6214,1.6492,1.5199,0.0845,1.1814,2.8215,0.1285,1.523,1.8897,2.1932,2.2017,0.1053,0.5272,7.7532,0.6177,2.3246,0.1856,0.0257,3.1786,2.3113,1.7769,1.2641,0.0061,0.4422,4.1634,4.2036,0.3211,5.2,3.2257,5.5397,3.0703,3.0337,0.0724,2.098,1.9626,1.8534,2.9139,3.4039,5.5282,1.4523,4.6443,3.597,0.8122,6.2637,0.6703,2.6861,1.0076,3.7617,0.8653,2.6823,7.3202,1.6416,2.4984,4.8402,2.2248,4.2909,1.83,0.7653,2.3145,3.0817,1.897,2.2548,0.0299,0.8617,6.6008,2.6389,4.1078,3.6987,4.1491,2.8831,0.2247,0.2319,1.9051,1.7111,5.4208,2.2543,3.9282,2.3996,4.6107,6.933,1.8562,8.3189,4.8392,1.5647,2.3849,1.9414,3.929,5.3125,0.2458,3.0995,7.6995,1.5247,1.8142,2.6576,0.9892,5.0173,0.5212,2.8133,2.0739,1.194,5.0911,5.0247,2.211,1.7351,2.5037,0.0351,0.799,6.1309,8.7591,3.4977,1.0909,1.143,2.8078,4.3507,2.0789,0.328,1.2991,3.99,1.2065,1.2532,3.794,5.8694,4.893,3.8541,7.8247,0.3899,5.1049,2.2993,4.2534,1.2447,6.9036,1.9519,1.745,6.1359,2.1113,3.3918,2.1493,3.012,

{"prompt":"Enter three hired , master assassins : Good , Fast , and Cheap . They can work together in pairs , but not as a trio .","text":"Enter three hired, master assassins : Good, Fast, and Cheap. They can work together in pairs, but not as a trio. Each pair is an independent party ; they can work as quickly, and as discreetly as possible, for either one master or two, if necessary. They are trained in any way deemed best for a professional assassin. There is one thing, however, which we ask for, and that is discretion. The name of the master or masteresses shall not be publicly known. The assassin is to be given ten pounds a month, and to receive all the supplies necessary for his work, and to retain the hire money until the day of the final payment. Upon receiving his instructions, the assassin is to make himself invisible as soon as he leaves the confines of the house, and he is to work as quietly and secretly as possible, so that no one not intimately acquainted with him can suspect that he is engaged in the work for the present master or masteresses. In the absence of his employer, he is to remain absent, in the city, from three o\u00b4clock A.M. to nine o\u00b4clock P.M. without giving a reason for so doing until the final payment of the fee has been made and witnessed. Should any attempt be made to interfere or communicate with the person of the assassin, or to ascertain his work in any way whatsoever, his employer is entitled to a bonus of twenty pounds for every successful attempt. The assassin will receive his monthly wage every third week, and he is warned to remain in the city upon receipt of that summons, for any reason whatsoever. This proposal is being made to you, my dear Lila and Liza, because, as you have said yourself, we have our plans ready to carry them out immediately, and because we feel perfectly certain that we will find you willing and anxious to act as our accomplices. Please give us your answer by wire. We will ask you for four more of your beautiful girls this evening, since, as you will see, we require a strong armory and not a very large number of professional assassins. At eleven P.M. the master will call you, Lila, Liza, and the others, and at this time you may receive your instructions for each of the assassins. Do you understand what I say?\nA wire for Lila came at that moment. This wire had the effect of causing both girls to turn pale, and caused them to gaze intently at the face at their side for a time before speaking.\n\" You don't know Lila and Liza, can you? \" Mr. Ritchie asked. \" These are my daughters ; I have promised to provide them with a good life, and to look after them until they get married. I shall pay them all the money they may need, but I shall ask of them this one thing, that they will act very discreetly, and never speak of this matter to anyone. I shall expect you to tell me your answer by wire. \"\nLena and Liza both began to stammer and tremble ; they did not know what to reply. Lila threw back her head in an attitude which seemed to say, \" You can keep your secrets! \" and Liza, for her part, was silent, her lips moving, her eyes glancing from side to side ; she seemed as if she might say something to her companion, but when Mr. Ritchie spoke, her lips parted, and she said:\n\" It is all right, Mr. Ritchie. We will do as you say, but... we have already talked this matter over, and we will act very discreetly ; we will act as if this were no concern we had.

{"prompt":"You are the most brilliant mind in the world , period . You are also a house pet .","text":"You are the most brilliant mind in the world, period. You are also a house pet. This article is about your intellect. So don\u2019t try to insult me with your feelings. The person whose intellect is higher than yours who is a house pet for you is someone who has no soul and that someone is me. So don\u2019t bother trying again. Because a person with a soul is far superior in his\/her field. The person who\u2019s intellect is of only one kind is never an accomplished human being. You\u2019re not one of these people. Your mind is quite brilliant, but you don\u2019t have any idea about the way we see human life. So please, please, be smart.\nYou probably think you know everything. You know very little about people. And no one can stop you from trying to know about the way we live. So do it as much as you want. It\u2019s not a crime to have such a view about life and such a view about people. But one must not ignore the people who think differently. Don\u2019t bother asking a smart question if you have no interest in answering. My answer would be \u201cNO\u201d. You could keep your intellect at your ease and your intellect would remain useless. The person who makes an effort to think and to learn has the value of your intellect.\nI am giving you my thoughts so that you know who\u2019s intellect superior. I am not offering you the solution to that problem. Because we are just two humble souls on earth who are trying to explore the ways of living on earth. I hope my words make you feel happy. I hope you are getting an impression that your life is not a waste. I hope you are not going to think that I am a cruel person, who is speaking out of hatred and greed. If I am giving you a lesson as if I am speaking of revenge, then I want you to understand, I am not doing so for any personal reason. What I am trying to do is to teach you a lesson of human life. I want you to look at our very humbled heart when we are talking about people. I want you to see how easily and effortlessly we accept or reject people on the basis of their appearance or their status. It makes me feel happy that I can see how easy it is to judge people.\nThat\u2019s why I am telling you my experience. Because you are a teenage boy. And your life is going to be different from mine. You can have an intellect of your own. And all you have to do is to take your intellect with you and live in the society. And learn how to live your life. Take your intellect\u2019s help.\nA. The person whose attitude is opposite to yours is a person who doesn\u2019t know himself\/herself.\nB. The person whose attitude is the same to yours is a person who doesn\u2019t have any problem. He is going to live this life as if it is a game. You can see the result of this kind of life. It\u2019s easy to judge, easy to think about the good or bad, easy to say the truth or the lies, easy to understand what you mean. It\u2019s very easy to make a person to be happy.\nC. The person whose attitude is the same to yours is a person who doesn\u2019t know himself\/herself. Because of ignorance he has to live in a different environment.

{"prompt":"A dying man attempts to make his last words profound and meaningful , but encounters difficulties in achieving this .","text":"A dying man attempts to make his last words profound and meaningful, but encounters difficulties in achieving this. How do you help?\nAs the saying goes, \"Life is a banquet, and only death is the host ; those at the feast are called guests but those invited to the table are the only ones who are truly welcome.\" A dying man in a hospital has just decided to make his life more poignant and meaningful by making a last will. An assistant to the dying man, a woman named Jennie arrives at the hospital and finds him trying to make this last will. Jennie is a nurse and a doctor, so she goes ahead and takes charge of the patient. The doctor in charge of the hospital is on the way to visit the dying man, and it falls to Jennie to help him with the difficult task.\nOnce the dying man becomes aware of Jennie at his bedside, he calls for an interpreter for his final words. The interpreter tells him that his last words are, \"Oh, I only want my last food to be a little chicken.\" The interpreter translates the words in the best way she can, but even so it's not easy for the dying man to absorb them. When he can't sleep at night, he can't eat or drink, and the doctor has to take him to a psychiatrist for treatment. The dying man still finds it difficult to understand how Jennie helped him make his last words more meaningful.\nSo, the assistant nurse is busy making another copy of the will in the hope that it will help the dying man through the ordeal. When the doctor returns, he tries to explain to Jennie the complicated state of the patient's nerves. The doctor is very glad that Jennie is helping the patient, but he is not so happy when he sees that the dying man is so depressed about his final situation. The doctor wants Jennie to help him give the patient a more comfortable feeling.\nThe nurse tries to cheer the patient with a few words of comfort, but to little effect. The doctor and Jennie try to help the dying man, but are not able to make the dying man feel more comfortable. The nurse is not so happy about the patient's depression. She is tired of taking care of the patient, but feels that the death of the patient is something to take pride in. She decides to try to cheer the patient up.Jennie offers to take the dying man to dinner in a restaurant nearby. The nurse realizes that she needs to give the patient some time to recover. So they go to the hospital for dinner, but they realize that the patient is not interested in anything but talking about his wife who is already dead.\nThe nurse then goes to the local pharmacy and buys a lot of pills for the patient. She puts his pills in the pill box he keeps in the drawer where he keeps his important papers. Jennie comes back to the patient and tells him about the pills. She tells the dying man that he will feel better if he sleeps well. The doctor sees the patient at the bedside and tells the nurse she needs to take good care of him. After a few days, the doctor is able to tell the patient that he is awake and he has received all the pills. Finally, the patient is ready to make his last words, and the doctor checks the pill box to hear the final words of death -which are, \"Oh, I only want my last food to be a little chicken.\"\nBy then the nurse also knows the meaning of the final words.

{"prompt":"Two planets inhabited by intelligent life exist orbiting the same sun together and acting as moons to each other .

Both aware for thousands of years that the other held life, but only now has one developed the potential to attempt communication. But the other also has technology to avoid contact and is able to manipulate weather as necessary to hide the contact from our sun and avoid being detected.\nEach system is designed to have only one moon at a time, because of how the weather \/ time will change if too many moons were brought into the sun. This gives them time to plan their attack and prepare.\nThe two planets would most likely live in opposite sides of their star, which would allow them to communicate without risking being caught by the other. This would be done using radio waves, which would also allow them to use technology from the opposing system to prevent detection \/ attack. This will be explained in the next part.\nThe two planets are much smaller versions of their sun, which has much bigger and much more aggressive moons. The two planets are roughly the same size as the Earth, but with about 20,000 times the mass of our planet.\nThe planets should have no natural gravity and very low moon phases. The moon would be designed to orbit a little more than half the time, and would come within about a mile of the surface of the other sun once every 3 or 6 days. It would appear, however, as if it were moving freely around, because it would appear to be within 10 miles of the surface of the sun at all times.\nThe moon should be designed to be able to sustain some surface water. It should be a lot hotter and have a much larger atmosphere than the surface of the Earth, but it should still have a large amount of liquid surface water, and hopefully a life supporting ocean underneath.\nThe two planets will be much closer together than Earth, and therefore the two moons will not have much gravity on them. This will be taken advantage of to make the moon a little more difficult to see and potentially less dangerous.\nThe two planets, the sun and the two moons will have all of their natural resources to support humans.\nThe sun and the two moons will be orbiting the same star together for thousands of years, until someone on one of the moons develops the technological ability to contact another of the two planets. This will be done in 2 ways.\nFirst, an object containing artificial intelligence could be placed within the sun, and then use the sun as a transmitter \/ receiver, because it should be very powerful enough not to be detected. However, it would be very difficult or impossible to achieve as an artifiact.\nThe alternative way would be to create a large moon from which they could send up a satellite containing artificial intelligence. This is much easier to do, and therefore will probably be the preferred method.\nThis satellite would be able to travel at a much higher speed than the Sun itself, and therefore can be placed within the sun so it appears to move like a satellite with the sun. They could then use the sunlight to power the artificial intelligence.\nThis method could be much faster, because the artificial intelligence would have a much slower life and would use much less energy than the Sun does.\nIt would also be much more difficult to detect because of the way the satellites would travel around the sun and also due to the fact that other artificial intelligent planets could be in the area of the sun and see the same moon as the artificial intelligent planet and not detect them.\nBoth options will allow the communication between the two intelligent systems to be much simpler.\nOnce the artificial intelligence on the moon is developed, the artificial intelligence then uses the artificial intelligence on the sun to try to communicate with the other. A contact between planets should only take a few weeks.","token_len":766,"entropy":[10.6755,8.5598,0.3901,4.7753,0.3497,5.5017,7.5275,1.5594,3.2962,3.0542,9.1419,3.4377,8.0957,0.7996,5.8148,3.6923,4.0622,0.0145,0.5271,5.0308,12.5309,8.6111,6.0494,0.0504,0.0345,1.4534,1.9501,2.1861,7.893,7.8413,1.3842,2.944,3.8015,4.5255,4.511,4.0082,7.3833,2.6149,5.5027,0.1866,7.8084,6.6863,1.8792,4.6387,2.1864,3.1867,5.9099,1.9012,7.2787,1.3928,6.8333,3.4465,2.3873,2.6969,4.3265,0.0339,4.6118,6.6094,4.5871,4.7337,0.9868,6.4878,1.9295,6.0977,2.5922,6.1483,5.1417,2.9877,4.7451,3.3748,1.5656,0.6523,1.7033,9.733,4.9223,1.4834,4.3134,0.464,2.3611,4.824,0.4217,5.4163,4.1336,1.1303,0.0124,1.3813,5.0995,2.6792,3.8433,2.4428,5.3917,9.5334,5.1711,4.4012,1.3106,5.7375,6.0707,0.2099,1.4038,4.6221,5.0207,0.9552,1.8753,4.8089,0.7219,2.997,3.9468,2.744,4.0288,0.1508,4.2678,1.1533,4.1808,1.4452,4.1451,3.5398,1.6549,1.8322,4.4672,1.8626,5.1741,6.6768,0.1871,4.6936,1.136,5.1709,4.578,0.1153,3.6136,3.5502,1.4202,2.9388,1.2297,2.7162,1.0373,0.1235,3.1197,3.2916,5.7189,2.9459,3.386,1.6934,1.0547,1.3168,1.8182,2.6434,0.989,2.6441,4.0026,2.9516,4.0423,0.9946,1.6569,1.6693,1.0831,3.659,1.7841,1.0786,0.0778,3.9687,5.0631,3.3498,1.4956,7.9145,1.3007,0.8549,4.37,1.6472,7.4139,3.1632,0.3632,3.0192,4.6436,2.2392,5.7587,0.9484,1.9767,1.0552,3.1903,1.3204,0.2343,1.5649,3.3099,0.6415,2.2657,5.6117,2.5691,7.27,0.0252,3.481,3.2338,1.2963,2.0306,3.4206,4.1292,3.7892,4.1286,3.1433,1.4223,7.1194,2.204,0.6954,1.7996,2.5795,1.0282,1.3625,5.9538,0.987,0.2161,0.3792,2.5052,1.4872,2.4887,0.8551,1.4895,3.0251,5.3517,4.2277,2.7618,0.0183,2.5956,0.7512,0.4718,0.1997,1.9272,2.5862,0.4928,1.2206,1.1428,2.731,6.2817,1.6757,3.6247,6.62,4.2346,2.0757,5.797,2.282,8.1729,5.5423,0.7495,1.7447,1.5678,3.3423,1.226,7.8397,0.4101,4.8398,3.0539,5.7338,2.4628,1.1325,3.0748,0.7744,4.3506,1.1309,1.735,2.371,5.947,3.6487,1.8494,2.1974,3.8317,0.4482,0.5909,4.5719,0.5141,0.404,4.9364,3.0264,7.1357,1.8089,3.7533,3.9318,4.1857,2.0911,0.2541,3.2455,0.6054,4.9759,5.8563,2.8406,0.0227,2.1117,1.0675,1.5517,1.3826,3.4736,6.4425,3.0035,3.2832,4.952,1.4848,0.9437,3.326,1.2537,0.9999,6.9834,3.4166,0.9833,0.2768,0.4128,1.0278,0.7214,0.269,1.3359,3.4047,2.7893,0.0108,0.3788,0.7235,1.006,1.2876,3.1657,0.9574,5.1921,0.3151,1.3807,4.5679,0.0054,6.1966,5.4445,6.3278,3.3208,2.4497,1.7961,1.4808,0.7841,3.6298,4.9552,5.5375,3.0837,2.4016,1.094,1.6005,2.6567,3.8113,1.0432,0.7859,3.4425,0.626,0.3368,2.4749,1.3466,2.0789,1.853,0.7001,3.4835,1.2221,1.234,3.5061,1.3906,0.0063,2.9986,6.826,0.5605,2.092,2.2693,7.6432,2.5652,6.5832,6.7101,4.9808,5.3124,0.9107,0.8219,0.7592,3.045,0.3061,2.7403,1.5456,3.525,2.19,1.0688,0.6135,1.6231,1.1425,1.6249,4.8014,2.8981,2.7766,2.0098,1.4411,3.277,1.7626,2.921,5.075,3.6203,1.6868,0.4794,2.3846,1.8114,1.9755,6.8836,3.5886,0.0167,3.1422,2.6938,1.264,2.4784,3.2807,2.6091,0.8911,3.2661,0.1457,4.1478,2.6169,5.992,4.8628,2.9398,1.3433,0.5457,0.8419,1.8448,0.7221,5.1278,3.0831,2.7633,0.1541,1.3383,5.1539,0.3893,2.5444,1.9714,6.4744,2.6784,1.2909,4.3809,3.1119,3.602,3.0975,6.0514,0.9349,1.922,1.0251,2.0691,1.7495,0.9424,1.8726,0.0437,0.7538,1.3751,5.093,1.6888,0.1944,1.0712,5.6214,4.0919,2.5991,0.0228,0.0192,1.241,4.6017,6.1171,4.6505,2.2797,0.425,0.9922,1.7857,6.6992,1.2849,6.4178,1.3281,0.0234,4.4397,3.9859,3.0653,0.3721,1.6642,0.6238,0.9074,2.0395,1.2422,1.5496,1.7696,2.83,5.0965,4.4519,1.1204,0.9157,2.7376,0.3067,4.6964,5.5485,7.1835,6.9864,1.6301,3.0206,0.7854,3.0121,2.7894,0.7473,1.9276,1.7611,1.2858,2.2301,5.0039,1.8152,3.0251,1.8249,0.4073,6.2074,6.1481,0.8749,2.9938,5.9522,1.4116,5.0148,0.7151,4.1805,3.3287,1.1565,4.9696,0.0647,0.7515,0.8217,1.6691,4.7923,0.0574,2.2922,1.3611,1.1213,1.761,0.9861,5.1026,0.0987,0.4233,5.5858,5.3211,3.6346,7.8034,6.1858,6.1127,2.2291,1.1795,2.0498,7.8557,5.0781,1.3389,0.0703,0.576,2.387,0.7513,3.7652,4.6582,4.5301,4.4629,4.2704,0.3776,2.0355,5.6958,1.8552,3.1281,7.2103,2.9371,0.0649,1.414,1.0404,3.05,3.6926,1.7381,1.193,0.6279,1.5886,1.9354,5.6698,3.0612,4.4106,0.9533,2.0966,3.6724,0.9187,1.0824,0.7772,3.3806,4.031,0.8234,0.9489,3.3985,0.0039,3.9886,2.47,1.7791,1.8357,1.7036,0.2664,0.4791,0.9577,4.1893,4.687,0.492,0.9959,4.5887,3.9232,1.188,3.4701,1.074,0.7434,1.1008,5.5697,1.9821,6.5341,1.0205,4.5416,5.0115,0.9517,2.0924,4.508,2.2704,3.8263,1.8434,5.5128,1.4643,1.9855,1.9164,1.6701,5.024,1.0487,4.6769,1.2505,3.4804,0.2079,2.0181,0.9399,2.2223,3.3393,2.4359,1.0754,4.4401,2.1424,1.2378,2.9732,1.319,1.7533,0.1279,0.947,1.9332,2.1093,0.6471,5.7841,3.6957,4.9893,1.9227,4.3637,2.0504,0.3149,0.3168,1.8073,0.4485,1.3528,3.7141,0.4253,1.2004,3.9393,1.0197,1.3807,0.6417,1.4327,1.5089,1.0582,0.4212,2.3142,3.1964,1.4957,0.4298,3.5103,0.5655,4.1183,1.2891,3.8235,3.7319,0.8885,0.7378,2.832,5.1333,5.0694,0.0059,0.4144,1.4968,0.1612,6.3755,3.5645,2.5087,3.8815,1.9136,1.215,3.1235,0.7681,4.2313,1.9958,0.8779,0.5233,2.7214,6.4507,1.5872,2.6152,4.0409,2.0059,0.8498,4.2243,1.3392,2.2493,4.7364,3.3941,4.8239,2.1754,0.5173,0.4834,5.1762,5.6966,3.0887,3.0534,0.9582,8.3036,0.9493,0.4619,0.1838,7.5176,2.3721,0.5214

{"prompt":"You enter an elevator to discover each floor is a year . The elevator is a time machine and you quickly realize that the top floor is troublingly 2021 .","text":"You enter an elevator to discover each floor is a year. The elevator is a time machine and you quickly realize that the top floor is troublingly 2021. The door opens and you are now in 2025. The elevator door is closed again and you descend to the main floor. An unnaturally beautiful woman is standing there with a gun. She pulls the trigger and the elevator pulls up to the top floor. A young man, dressed in jeans and t-shirt, opens the elevator door smiling at you with a red bandana tied around his head. The elevator pulls up into your arms and you are transported to your dorm room. You walk in and a flashlight is shining inside your room. You immediately put on your bed linen and then notice a big hole in your bed. It seems to be a large glass window. The glass is cracked. A thin red line runs from the window towards the ceiling. A few seconds later you are awakened and find yourself face-down on the floor. The room is dark and you cannot remember how you got here or why it's so dark. You realize your room is only a fraction of your size. You hear a commotion outside and then realize you're on the ground. The world has ended and it's 5am.\nIf you were in an apocalyptic scenario from the point of view of a military officer, the world is in the middle of a huge war. On the map two circles with two arrows are drawn in. The outer circle points at a planet called Alpha. The inner circle points at a planet called Beta. At the moment of writing, the two planets are still in a state of conflict but a war broke out between the two worlds. Now is the moment of truth: The day will come when everything gets to an end. The battle has broken out not only in the outer circle of the map but the battle also involves the inner circle and therefore the fight extends to the inner planets. As you are in the middle of this warzone, now you get to choose which star you would like to fight for. In the first mission, you are given a single objective and you must take over the Alpha star from the enemy. On the planet Alpha (the planet next to Beta), you will find some enemy soldiers. The next mission will take place on the second planet called Beta. The enemy are a species called the Smasher. You will need some time to familiarize yourself with the whole situation and the first step is to find out exactly where the battle is happening.\nYou will have to destroy the enemy's spaceship by shooting it and destroy the enemy from ground and air. First of all, you can either drive cars and shoot them with a shotgun or you can use a powerful rocket launcher to fly low and shoot. You will also need a lot of ammunition to drive your cars. After a few missions, you will come to the military base where you can choose how to fight this war. If you want to make war with the air, you can also buy some airplanes which are cheaper, but also more expensive. Of course, you also get a lot of new weapons, vehicles and upgrades and you will soon become a very good soldier!\nNow it is time to create and set up your own warzone as a warzone designer. To start you have to choose a planet and then the enemy. The next thing you need to select is the name of your warzone, the number of players and the difficulty. You can test your warzone against other warfare and be the first one to set up the world with a unique planet and unique enemy.

It has never succeeded in changing human behavior. No one who hanged or was hanged ever learned to stop committing a crime or to be a better human being. It is based on a belief that one can solve a moral problem by murdering someone.\nLisa Jansen - the executive director of the World Coalition for Women and Law, is an American lawyer who advocates for women\u2019s rights and has been involved in the death penalty debate for 30 years, as well as human rights issues and criminal justice reform more generally.\nLisa Jansen is a professor of criminology at the University College of London and a member of the council of the Criminal Law Review.

{"prompt":"Write a letter to your 20 year old self .","text":"Write a letter to your 20 year old self. It\u2019s about what you want to achieve and what you want to change and what you feel about. When you write your self you help yourself and you guide others because who\u2019s reading your note. Keep you dream alive and write.\nNow start to get better at your physical fitness, you know what you want to do in the future. If you are a fitness freak, and now is the time to get your body ready for the gym. In the gym or just at home on the floor. Do exercises such as squats, weightlifting exercises, bench squats, push-ups, dips, rowing, leg lifts etc. Start a fitness journal to capture some of the most important changes in your life. And also write down why you started to go to the gym. At the end of the day. Make sure you have the right amount of food, a good amount of rest, and good sleep. If you are not a very disciplined person, but you like the gym to exercise with others. Go to the gym. Do as many bodyweight exercises you like. Go to the cardio equipment. Move your feet around the floor and hit the floor. Try to find a class to join up with different people and keep track of how busy your life is, and if you need more time to exercise.\nWrite down as often as possible what you know and what you know not. If you\u2019re still learning this is the first thing. If you love animals try to learn more about them. If you love cars then buy a copy of the book called 100 great books about cars. Learn more about them. You can learn about anything you like. Write down what you know about anything and anything you know will help you understand it better at the end of the day. Keep a diary of your learning and also about what you have read, watch and learn on the internet and use that to guide you more.\nWrite down all the things you want to change. And then write about them. For example, you want to lose weight, to lose belly fat, to gain muscle, to learn, and so on. So if you want to lose weight, then when you write about that, write, \u201cI want to lose weight, because I still want to be fit, healthy and look good.\u201d Or when you want to learn, then you can write, \u201cI want to learn how to do Google AdWords.\u201d So write down your life changes in your change log.\nIf you are a good writer take your journal to the next level. Create a story and write about whatever you want. Whether you want to write about your childhood, or what you hope to achieve in the future. Writing a story allows you to write in the third person and you can use more vocabulary and you can even use more adverbs which makes your sentences flow better. Writing a story is actually one of my favorite ways to learn about new things, things in the past or things that are going to come in the future. So if you want to write a story about the things you like and do write it down.\nAnd always use the right vocabulary. Look at how many words per sentence. If the average is eight, you\u2019re doing fine. Write down a list of how many words you want to write and what you want to write. For example, if you are looking to lose weight, then as a way to lose weight, maybe it is to write about walking. Walk. Or if you\u2019re trying to learn something, go and do some research and write down what you want to learn and what you want to get out of it, so that when you write the story, you can make it

{"prompt":"Your train stops in the middle of nowhere , the doors slide open , the staff have vanished , then you hear it .","text":"Your train stops in the middle of nowhere, the doors slide open, the staff have vanished, then you hear it. The faint crackle of the radio, the familiar song. You turn up the station and listen.\nThere was a short while back that I thought I heard what sounded like Radio 2 in a train carriage. The song was played but I would assume at a much lower volume than that in question.\nThanks for the links. The Radio 2 song on the first link is the old Beatles one, and I thought perhaps the song they play might be played more often as it happened to be an old track.\nWell as I sit here listening to the song, I do think it is quite a nice song. I also am surprised that I haven't heard it before - I listen to some radio quite often as well as a number of radio stations on my computer (not for many years on my mobile phone). I believe it was the Beatles song which played in a train carriage. A couple of days ago I actually listened to the song in a train, I will say this, as a song I like and don't even particularly like the lyrics, but the music is a treat.\nMy guess it that the song was played by a regular radio station in a passenger train, as some people would listen to radio at the time, unlike now as digital technology has taken over (but still has an audience).\nI do however remember listening to BBC Radio 2 as a young girl and it would appear that it was the Beatles songs which I was more likely to hear on that station.\nThanks for the replies. Some of the comments have really confused me. On the old BBC Radio 2 programme I remember listening to a song from this album, which sounded a lot like the radio station theme song. It was the song they played quite a lot on at the time, and it just stuck with me. I've been trying to look again today and was listening to this Radio 2 song, which I thought might have been played in a train carriage with the same theme song as that on BBC Radio 2. If Radio 2 were still aired, would that match up with the song being played in a train carriage?\nDoing a bit of research I have the following. The Radio 2 song in question and the music that has played in a car, was indeed the old Beatles one, and is played by one of the regular radio stations. The Radio 2 website has a link for The Music That Goes On, and amongst the regular programmes there is a playlist of Radio 2 programmes, which includes The Music That Goes On, where again the name of the radio station comes up. However the Radio 2 website has a comment for the BBC Radio 2 programme that the Radio 2 song in question (which sounds very similar to my guess of the train station song, but the music is different) is indeed the theme song of a BBC Radio 2 programme; and it is the programme I have been looking for!\nI was told by someone who was very close to my family who died young that he got very irritable and argumentative during his final days and used to say 'I'm not going to live to see the news!'\nI was told this by my uncle who was in the military, killed in action, in 1971 in South East Asia, the war with Vietnam.\nDuring WWII the Italian government was worried about a massive war and the possibility that it would be in Europe and therefore decided that it had no place in a country where its people enjoyed so much freedom. So in 1947 they decided to move to America; but it was not allowed to be broadcast.\nI was told it by a man who had been there and had seen it but it is too bad he didn't have a camera in the car when

{"prompt":"You are an `` escort '' , but not in the sexual sense , your job is to make sure you clients get home safely by any means necessary .","text":"You are an `` escort '', but not in the sexual sense, your job is to make sure you clients get home safely by any means necessary. This means that you get hired by different people and must not disclose to your employer anything about your work, your clients or their business. You also keep your identity secret from your clients and never show their faces in the course of a job.\nWhat you do is the exact opposite of prostitution. In this case you have nothing to do with sex, though to the extent that you know it, this can of course be a side- line activity. As an escort you can work with men and women, they can also be the same person.\nIn many cases you are escorted by your clients where you find yourself at, either directly on their premises or in a place close by.\nI believe that there are also other things involved such as having to make sure your clients'personal belongings remain safe, and if they do leave a large sum of money lying around, you make sure it doesn't fall in the wrong hands.\nThe job of escort is a good business in its own right, but at the same time you need to do extra work in the form of online reviews to make sure that these are real, and that they are positive. The best way of doing this is to be honest so that the clients can get the real picture.\nThis might not be as good a job as some of them sound like, but what you have to remember is that in the end you are a woman, and you can only control who your client is. If they can only see you when you are escorted by someone else, then you have no problem at all, because you will know to say no if it's not what they expect.\nYou must remember however, that you are also the one who is paying for your clients, and that you should not be embarrassed or ashamed that one day they have had to pay you some extra money.\nI think it is a rather good profession, but some of you might say that there are better jobs to have instead. It is possible to join a professional organization or register with the police if necessary, but it's important to know at some point that you have to work in this field, you have to accept the fact that you live with the risk that someone will have to give you a good sum of money in order to work for them.\nIt's not as risky as prostitution, but then again, you don't have to work with someone you want to, and you have nothing to do with sex either way.\nWhat is important is that you get paid and that it is a job that keeps you busy so that you don't have to spend much time looking for clients.\nThis is an alternative to prostitution for women who want to earn a reasonable amount of money without much risk. It can be dangerous since you might end up being caught, but at the same time it is a good idea to keep your identity a secret, and to work with one employer only.\nThe escort you might find yourself thinking of when you think of prostitution, the role you are supposed to play is entirely different from what would happen in a normal scenario. The job requires you to spend a lot of time with your client, but you don't have to go to bed with them, although there are certain locations you always go to where your client and you are going to share a bed.

{"prompt":"Your child is the ( next ) Messiah . They have come to you for guidance before setting off . It 's your last chance to speak to them as a parent .","text":"Your child is the ( next ) Messiah. They have come to you for guidance before setting off. It's your last chance to speak to them as a parent. Here is some very important information on what to do before your child leaves. Be aware of the following warnings.\nYour young 'uns, your son and his friends have left home, and you do not know where they are right now. Some are at the airport, some are walking through the streets, some are going to a party or are out having fun. But, unfortunately, several of them are in terrible danger and you just do not know how to help them. There is an evil force, known as 'The Hidden Knights ', which controls several teenagers and young 'uns. It is known as'The Power of Darkness '. The Hidden Knights control your child, and they are watching over him to have him killed. There is a powerful evil group with headquarters in New York City that consists of about 50 members who make up the Hidden Knights of Satan. These children are the true Messengers to wake up the world because this planet needs these young 'uns to become the Light.'The power of Darkness'now controls your child. The Hidden Knights of this evil group also control you. Your child, the Messiah, is the real Light of this world. This is why he has to leave home and meet with an FBI agent, for the first time since he walked into this life. The Hidden Knights of Heaven have been watching your family for thousands of years. They use the powers of darkness to control and manipulate you to lead your children astray.\nThey say that the Messiah is the Great Wizard of Fire, but the powers of fire are not as important to them as the powers of darkness. The evil forces control the power of light and want to use it to darken and control the world. Therefore, they want you to lose your faith. This is why they have been trying to take over the world. They have taken over New York City for 10 years with the Illuminati and the Golden Calf. They did not want that their evil forces got too powerful. This is also why they have been trying to get you to believe that there is a Dark Forces. But, in reality, The Hidden Knight group is the real power that controls and manipulates you.\nThe power of Darkness controls this planet through hidden forces. It is like a black cloud which makes the entire world dark and miserable. It is a powerful force that controls you and others. This is why you must pray and believe, that you cannot become the Messenger to wake up the world, until you can stand up to these forces and defeat them. But, if you do not, the children of the Messiah will become the Light, and will awaken the whole world. Therefore, you must fight!\nMy son is the real Messiah and will become the leader of the new world. Your son is in the midst of the battle between the Light and the Dark Forces. He has to leave home and meet with an FBI agent. During this meeting, the FBI agent will put an informant on your child - the real Messiah, to stop'The Power of Darkness'from controlling your son.\nThis informant must be taken out. This is why the FBI agent will take a picture of the informant and that photo will be used for this purpose to remove the informant. Therefore, my son, the real Messiah, will meet with an FBI agent for the first time and will also have a photo taken of him, before he steps forward to help and save the children of the world.\nYou must pray to protect and help your child.

{"prompt":"Once Earth 's population reaches 20 billion , everything begins to lag and stutter .","text":"Once Earth's population reaches 20 billion, everything begins to lag and stutter. In an age of nuclear warfare, everything seems to be taking forever, and it hurts.\nHow many years until world famine? A lot of years... It is unlikely that the world can sustain its current population of about 7 billion people, with its current agricultural methods. But if we decide now to implement food shortages and famine and starvation, we can probably make it happen in less than 2,000 years, no matter what happens.\nHow many years until the first manned space landing on another planet other than Earth? If you wait 40-50 years, it's highly likely. And if you wait 40-50 years, and you launch people to other planets, I bet it will happen. But the people won't be able to get there easily. If humanity has the means, it might be able to get humans away from Earth.\nThe problem is that we've become so dependent on a particular Earth-based system, with a specific set of circumstances. If we make a mistake, it can be catastrophic.\nIf you look around your neighborhood and you see a bunch of people being murdered - in their cars - you suspect some crime, but you don't know what it is. In a nuclear war, that would be hard.\nThe system in which we are currently living is now getting dangerously close to its tipping point and may become unstable. All of the major catastrophes of the 20th century - WWII, the oil crisis, the Cuban missile crisis - could have been avoided, and there really don't appear to be any signs of any of those sorts of problems in the foreseeable future.\nThe problem is that our economy is fundamentally unrealistic and inconsistent with how the world should truly be running. It also has a limited time horizon : it is based on an unsustainable level of consumption in order to create the illusion of material and moral progress.\nFor example, the economy is designed to allow more cars in New York City than there are actual roads there. The only way that our urban society could continue such an absurdly inefficient level of consumption is if the world came to accept such consumerist nonsense.\nI understand that consumerism is a great idea. We should love the things we buy. I do.\nThe problem is: What exactly do we mean by material and moral progress? There is an endless stream of people buying up every possible new toy. The toys are there. But people do not need anything they have not had before.\nLet's say the population of a certain place increases from 100 to 200 people in a couple of years. At some point, the people no longer feel that 200 people is enough and they move up to 300. But the population is still 200 people.\nThe same is true for the amount of goods and stuff and other forms of wealth. People will find that things become useless after a certain point. The problem is that material possessions and material wealth have no intrinsic value. They are just a series of symbols, and in a world of symbols and numbers, symbols and numbers are meaningless.\nLet's say you decide to get a new laptop. You pay for it and it's gone. You pay for a new bicycle. It's taken forever to deliver it but you no longer want the bicycle because you need a newer car.\nIn some respects, the problem with material consumption and things is the same problem as with nuclear war. What is the point of owning a certain kind of car - a BMW - if I have to spend $300,000 to own it? Or if I drive it so many miles per year, that the car is broken within five years? Or if the battery dies and I have to leave it in the driveway because I don't have any money to rent it any more?","token_len":774,"entropy":[9.9217,1.678,3.8836,3.5194,4.6419,0.4035,0.606,8.376,5.3668,0.0491,9.8365,5.1284,7.8194,0.9499,0.7695,3.5323,4.0005,2.9225,0.8992,6.2131,4.5843,0.3344,5.3526,3.9509,0.6101,1.0195,5.5797,3.5213,2.8284,1.1317,3.0913,8.7277,1.5376,1.336,12.1225,3.1256,3.577,3.9183,7.718,5.0204,2.2404,4.1683,3.9549,1.9058,5.5285,5.2534,4.4195,2.7396,6.1065,0.84,1.8115,2.1096,3.4157,3.1357,3.2362,1.1115,1.7625,2.0096,2.1934,3.672,0.2585,1.5551,1.679,3.9645,4.1062,2.0373,5.3041,6.2938,2.2133,2.8121,2.4142,1.6605,6.6034,5.2929,1.2525,6.5918,4.4115,4.8849,2.1768,3.0807,4.5774,3.1167,1.1263,1.8442,2.2322,4.5635,3.9474,2.2801,2.2952,2.8649,2.6473,0.0432,3.3913,2.171,0.4064,0.0366,1.9064,5.5967,0.3218,0.8556,2.6462,1.339,0.9164,3.3367,1.5151,1.4313,0.8332,1.7045,4.079,6.0339,1.8198,5.9471,1.6243,5.7637,0.1281,9.4074,0.0124,0.3616,0.2524,4.16,2.9127,6.1616,6.9447,3.5706,0.4532,0.1583,0.8892,2.6169,2.7079,5.4639,1.2113,4.6556,3.6813,0.9424,0.5664,0.2926,2.6633,0.4971,0.0494,0.1295,0.3059,5.0826,1.6026,6.2058,6.5252,2.4576,2.9283,0.2564,0.7925,6.1597,3.2546,2.6515,1.2994,1.6618,1.9838,2.8773,3.2848,5.1438,5.1065,0.001,1.4001,1.475,0.0065,3.0567,2.0836,5.9859,0.8592,3.4347,4.9695,3.6493,2.8199,2.1422,1.1058,1.7277,4.0299,1.2102,2.3789,0.016,2.0799,5.1609,7.3254,0.3514,1.6791,1.7581,1.0749,2.9999,4.4092,1.0626,0.6766,2.1565,3.5304,4.7795,1.2962,2.1478,0.0929,3.9889,6.452,6.3958,2.1176,1.12,2.9157,1.6178,3.7523,2.5436,4.0613,2.7076,0.0041,5.1822,3.5843,2.7558,0.8395,4.7605,1.7774,2.0616,0.6722,2.3606,1.8652,2.0545,2.8392,0.5151,2.4328,2.7834,2.0688,3.855,3.1187,4.1092,2.7898,2.3145,1.4977,0.4038,1.8418,3.5468,0.0034,1.2722,4.7902,4.0307,5.7989,4.1548,4.3133,2.8878,2.3032,1.9635,7.4584,4.0254,4.7741,2.4001,1.2191,1.2365,0.9468,0.0006,1.0745,1.5959,1.6915,0.3849,0.4933,3.8709,2.6074,6.2724,0.9328,0.2457,3.4919,2.5804,0.7771,6.3232,1.8285,1.9375,2.6805,5.8388,3.7443,1.1682,1.1781,2.2378,3.2966,1.0598,1.2458,6.084,6.2355,4.7015,1.0181,0.0792,4.091,4.7149,0.0056,4.2729,4.7021,3.6835,3.2247,0.804,5.6796,1.5762,1.7518,3.3066,7.4193,0.0011,0.0,3.0225,0.3904,2.6044,0.0181,0.0945,2.7486,7.0777,0.1608,1.5545,6.1364,1.8301,0.2907,0.661,4.7982,1.4965,0.041,0.8511,3.0624,2.8928,0.7916,0.4522,2.7372,2.2558,3.1886,6.0144,8.1053,0.0002,2.1104,0.0472,0.0118,0.3386,2.9178,0.4442,2.735,1.6374,1.5362,6.874,0.0506,2.9531,2.9612,0.7025,3.0792,0.0018,0.0635,0.6633,2.3003,2.7241,0.621,0.3188,3.3749,5.6562,0.5708,5.5873,10.7929,2.0928,8.1685,2.3072,4.3269,3.1009,0.6283,1.9262,8.3601,1.3189,4.7106,0.3094,2.7511,4.9758,2.2801,1.3686,5.1732,5.4966,0.6817,10.5303,2.8809,1.9938,6.1458,0.1529,3.724,4.1312,4.0557,0.0294,3.486,4.3163,2.5354,0.0578,4.5047,2.3106,4.4883,0.3846,7.7835,4.4033,2.6099,1.409,0.4279,0.9325,4.6857,1.4301,0.0786,1.997,4.9616,1.6883,4.7152,0.342,4.8138,5.2824,5.83,3.6362,6.5221,0.1668,1.0478,1.2678,3.9338,0.113,7.1604,3.8356,5.9224,0.495,2.2928,3.0125,1.0013,2.6653,4.1683,6.1315,4.4885,2.1814,3.672,6.9123,1.874,3.6076,1.4952,3.3072,3.4478,0.026,0.6275,0.7716,0.6186,2.1795,3.5541,6.1887,1.1279,4.2319,5.5103,8.039,3.8237,7.5285,1.3922,0.7525,3.8998,4.9418,0.687,7.6767,0.1831,0.8077,1.5934,4.1082,1.236,1.654,3.6841,2.3801,5.868,2.5456,4.5521,0.6548,1.5243,1.6116,2.6321,3.069,2.7995,2.7406,3.4326,1.745,0.5371,6.0768,5.0185,5.159,2.385,0.4612,4.2111,0.1339,6.9391,1.3612,0.0135,0.0189,0.2573,4.5946,1.1317,3.5003,4.5867,2.1491,0.0132,3.6534,5.8609,5.9158,4.4104,3.0614,5.4754,5.7201,2.3971,2.5191,6.5561,1.2423,6.2857,3.4488,2.777,4.7561,3.8441,0.1302,3.9699,5.3086,6.3833,2.7257,3.3983,4.5274,1.4279,0.3724,1.3972,5.1406,0.4745,1.9107,2.869,4.4917,0.4344,2.2153,3.8158,3.7278,4.6005,3.1544,3.3167,2.049,1.5722,2.2135,2.9021,1.2277,4.5025,0.2491,1.0836,0.399,5.1768,3.0298,0.0937,0.7346,1.6884,3.2358,6.9401,0.0011,5.1763,2.2441,10.0126,0.4673,2.1586,1.3202,3.648,1.5963,4.0823,4.4868,1.0517,2.6885,1.4483,2.6238,2.1936,1.4264,2.8762,1.3506,3.9917,0.4219,0.8352,2.3919,2.2495,4.2794,2.8211,0.0704,1.0279,1.5078,4.8505,0.0261,2.7996,1.5356,7.5711,6.3507,3.5,4.5565,0.006,3.345,1.3861,3.0627,3.2424,5.1366,2.3017,5.1177,5.3867,6.1409,3.7835,1.1346,0.9338,1.7042,0.8534,2.4854,3.5771,0.3212,0.4326,5.5869,6.5626,2.8741,3.0359,1.9656,2.9498,2.374,3.9135,0.2237,0.7551,2.5281,0.8237,2.0747,2.4149,4.8115,0.0019,5.9619,2.2941,2.2887,4.2135,2.1779,2.5365,1.6871,5.5903,2.5132,3.9739,0.3005,4.1625,1.1724,0.5462,3.8652,1.6449,0.2999,0.5634,4.2006,0.1666,0.472,2.4514,4.6675,0.3562,4.6836,1.4625,2.4812,5.3038,1.5201,1.6183,4.8044,2.313,0.3819,3.0164,1.9324,2.515,4.6671,0.4278,1.6285,3.2653,0.8843,1.9702,0.4755,6.496,1.2233,1.6427,0.8267,6.1761,4.152,0.8048,7.2557,1.8565,5.1539,1.2027,6.8386,0.0078,2.2716,3.7077,3.3036,3.3752,0.9625,4.3597,2.4356,5.1855,4.1621,0.5293,1.4955,3.3533,4.3658,4.8432,0.2991,1.4285,2.9332,2.5691,1.5225,5.5569,1.4226,7.5064,1.8443,3.1451,0.2476,1.737,2.9467,0.6995,9.4548,1.0741,0.5749,4.4287,2.0081,1.2445,2.4673,0.5091,5.56,0.6775,5.5232,1.7064,0.0014,3.9212,5.1201,1.8432,4.9514,2.2128,0.4044,5.2826,2.3924,0.5572,3.7809,2.5058,3.

{"prompt":"Through Iron And Flame","text":"Through Iron And Flame, which also happens to be a double album, there are no less than seven songs featuring original members of the band, including new members. They\u2019re all excellent, all strong, and it makes sense why Iron And Flame is a songbook for the band.\nI\u2019d also like to note that I enjoyed the songs, the arrangements, and the production. There are no duds on the record. I found myself grooving to two tracks on a long flight \u2013 \u201cBurning Down The Houses\u201d and \u201cThe New Land\u201d \u2013 and I even enjoyed the fact that it wasn\u2019t overdone. All-in-all, I\u2019d say that Iron And Flame is an outstanding release from a band who I hope will do great things on and off stage.\nI know where you are coming from and I just want to point out that the line \"There's an angel on his arm\" isn't used.\nNot used at all...it is just a line from a song that was never used. I have no explanation for it but it is that simple.\nThe one that I always use, for whatever reason... I forget the rest but thats the one that I always use and it just might be in the lyrics\nthe other was a lyric that i heard in a recording of the movie \"willie\" and was the only line i remember off the top of my head\nYes, that's usually how it is, but I don't recall any other song with that song's title, at least not with the word, \"angel\" in.\nOn a previous post you said you loved that movie Willie. The song on the album is called 'Willie - A Man For All Seasons'\nI had no idea. I have always thought it was a reference to the classic Willie Nelson song, and only learned about it this morning. Thanks for the info\nI just recently read the book The Secret and it has a line in it about a man wanting to sell the painting but not wanting the art critic too know that it's his. The art critic gives him a piece of advice: \"it's the work itself, not a man's name or title on it, that is the most valuable.\"\nI thought the same thing, but the quote, \"it's the work itself, not a man's name or title on it, that is the most valuable.\"\nI got that same line off of this website as well. I wonder what the book meant by the quote or was it a typo.\nOne of the two guys in the cover photo was my old college football coach. The other played college football (though he was a wide receiver on the team and he spent four years on the practice squad) and he is now a general manager of a MLB team. :o)\nI used to know Joe Fusco. Joe was a scorer for the Jets from 1972- 1976. He retired after a long run with New York as player, coach, then as an assistant to Bill Parcells when he ran the Eagles from 1979 to 1982. He was the driving force behind the contract with Joe Montana and Barry Sanders.\nI still have a few photos from my childhood that Joe was the center picture with my brother and me. I don't know what he does now. We saw him some years ago and we talked.\nLinda- I saw Joe Fusco in the 80's at the Yankees and he was the manager of the Mets at that time. I think he passed away.\nI saw Joe Fusco in the 80's at the St Louis Cardinals. I didn't have much to say to him, but he did come to see me a couple of times. He seems very nice as well.","token_len":774,"entropy":[9.7408,8.104,8.913,2.3132,3.8387,4.4951,4.5192,0.0993,0.3369,1.7727,7.4082,3.1889,1.1105,4.9676,1.7984,3.4442,5.2224,0.2143,3.1613,1.6242,5.2407,6.9904,3.779,0.7913,1.0014,0.516,1.6104,1.0473,5.2912,1.8065,5.2865,4.3124,18.5607,9.0257,3.4621,2.177,6.0887,1.6552,4.7592,6.2721,1.0449,1.4376,5.0576,3.6059,2.076,3.0995,3.7836,0.4998,0.0246,1.8118,2.6618,5.0652,5.8493,1.4391,2.366,2.4744,0.7293,1.4219,7.268,4.948,0.5974,1.6919,4.1002,0.9878,1.113,2.9581,0.2741,3.6612,6.7036,1.3369,4.1638,3.7038,4.376,5.3151,0.1686,0.5938,0.5743,3.7221,1.5824,3.4243,1.3308,2.861,6.4366,0.7279,3.5024,1.4678,1.6185,1.4611,2.1254,4.6416,2.3756,8.0735,0.1898,3.9762,7.4482,3.0969,2.9791,3.0359,5.4166,5.8034,8.413,9.6416,5.4733,9.8144,1.6402,4.1548,1.4769,8.6628,2.5347,7.7031,1.0619,0.9823,0.1379,2.2177,6.0613,6.9741,0.4748,0.2186,1.4828,1.4438,2.2497,5.2812,2.621,1.0354,4.7152,0.0609,3.318,3.7134,2.1611,1.7619,0.8322,7.0235,0.6337,0.7419,4.5326,5.5931,0.3409,0.128,0.012,0.2156,1.3159,2.9852,0.0489,0.6578,4.0867,1.2596,3.7262,0.1217,0.0053,0.7083,2.6249,3.8621,5.3163,3.1229,2.7621,0.4402,2.2684,5.0335,3.6787,1.4427,5.7396,3.5401,0.1552,4.428,5.0562,0.0484,2.2501,0.4497,0.7837,2.3647,4.8257,6.3128,1.1619,1.2555,1.5977,0.0287,4.0077,1.0187,4.8097,0.987,0.0721,3.7467,0.3293,0.3426,2.729,6.6777,2.6654,4.9563,1.7191,4.0085,6.4521,2.8113,5.068,4.2702,1.2764,3.4989,1.13,4.1967,2.5294,2.7661,6.1785,5.6767,2.5386,0.0181,6.4971,4.6572,2.592,3.4511,1.6332,3.1331,3.1372,1.8795,0.8801,1.9425,2.519,3.3622,1.4112,0.9441,2.3088,3.7243,2.0489,7.9728,0.3909,2.0233,3.7112,1.7052,1.6616,5.874,3.4596,0.3257,1.1156,2.8211,5.4448,3.266,2.1998,4.8052,4.4656,3.0383,4.1534,4.1699,0.0595,5.4671,3.8819,6.0773,2.755,5.3454,5.1798,7.7281,2.778,1.6178,1.0042,1.0678,2.5212,1.0352,3.2591,2.0698,3.4169,6.6028,0.8797,4.6885,1.4843,4.1367,5.5968,5.3928,3.3093,5.8692,2.1966,3.9164,1.2952,5.2738,3.1998,2.3149,1.6207,4.1447,1.4423,1.5661,4.3423,2.236,11.7304,4.3733,1.5113,2.4027,3.3412,3.9952,2.4024,3.3492,3.3245,2.5742,7.697,1.4264,1.757,0.0338,0.0016,0.0133,2.223,6.9222,0.6192,2.6447,1.3796,8.8101,3.0777,1.8049,1.1895,2.6976,1.2959,2.425,2.3886,0.6283,2.9975,2.6688,1.3859,2.763,3.7015,1.1998,4.2144,5.1667,3.8825,2.7906,5.8495,0.3203,0.6474,3.9933,0.9235,4.0735,4.4635,1.4704,3.6875,2.1173,1.0448,7.2672,1.1117,5.6953,2.4435,6.3511,2.0335,5.6397,1.8758,2.6813,5.0564,4.2398,5.3384,13.4567,1.4158,4.7027,2.36,4.8875,0.7748,1.6202,1.1726,1.8071,4.5166,0.9935,0.0147,6.2419,3.6029,4.0411,3.3809,2.6516,0.1394,1.6727,3.2025,1.9939,4.7365,2.4463,0.118,3.4789,1.4699,4.0211,3.9426,3.1004,2.2874,0.2464,0.9924,4.8591,0.0225,1.0848,5.7424,2.7698,2.4508,0.8142,1.5948,4.3399,6.4756,6.7524,1.0889,0.5402,5.2383,2.5422,1.2286,6.6702,0.7329,1.2281,2.3773,4.7233,1.7388,3.7854,5.0457,2.157,2.158,3.0327,3.3764,5.7293,5.7697,4.4407,3.1749,1.7132,7.3192,2.5881,0.5729,2.194,1.9624,2.0725,7.0872,0.3257,5.7439,3.0472,8.3518,6.2018,3.3855,2.2141,2.7629,4.6369,11.1564,7.137,8.1887,2.5802,2.3194,2.5877,4.3075,5.2137,3.163,4.3663,0.0842,6.0721,0.9922,1.2259,3.0113,0.1539,4.8114,3.3054,1.3201,5.8999,1.0483,3.3903,4.873,4.5473,1.4752,1.2767,4.8088,5.4827,1.2318,5.1775,2.8681,4.2452,6.1105,0.8068,2.31,3.5878,3.2873,0.96,3.8842,4.0413,3.25,1.2286,1.5901,3.9891,2.4449,4.1425,0.334,2.8015,1.1661,3.0358,4.6745,4.3418,0.8851,2.81,0.3962,0.3396,0.2708,0.0496,0.4509,0.0228,0.2124,0.0349,0.0049,0.006,0.168,0.0269,0.1706,0.0007,0.2313,0.071,0.01,0.0369,0.0168,0.011,2.2684,1.2218,1.6818,4.9854,2.6627,4.2466,3.2765,4.978,1.5333,3.5098,3.2845,4.2302,0.4326,0.926,1.7997,5.3146,1.8824,2.0197,4.4415,7.2248,1.9319,2.3962,1.491,4.513,3.9479,0.6976,2.026,5.7227,2.214,0.9977,5.19,1.348,0.2338,6.0535,5.0539,1.9639,0.4304,5.8473,2.2334,2.5502,4.6419,3.9191,5.3887,5.0287,0.6332,1.8667,3.0263,1.0684,6.8056,3.9635,0.1041,5.53,5.7761,1.406,1.4574,1.6851,5.113,0.075,4.8778,0.9053,1.7755,3.1811,3.1733,5.9696,5.4278,0.5289,2.6085,0.289,4.6436,0.212,1.7831,0.4895,1.5682,3.114,2.6354,1.6379,4.7,0.1035,1.6355,1.7491,10.2395,0.3767,0.4755,9.2464,4.2672,0.48,0.5199,1.5745,6.0403,0.1354,3.8188,5.6917,5.5033,6.3098,0.1971,2.661,4.0307,1.2444,1.1389,10.4418,1.6899,0.6504,5.9641,2.8158,4.2709,0.6669,11.2437,1.1071,0.8218,5.7502,2.4932,2.9087,3.6726,6.4837,2.6051,4.5642,0.7225,4.2536,7.1328,3.9605,0.8355,0.6808,6.7623,4.269,3.6475,0.4623,3.0674,2.9848,2.9325,0.001,4.6736,0.8864,4.7349,0.6157,5.3016,2.203,2.8022,2.5391,1.9964,0.2277,1.4653,1.2832,2.0835,7.3357,0.0041,0.1965,0.4594,9.1285,3.5755,6.3051,6.2563,2.1067,8.7697,0.6685,1.2779,1.8186,2.2247,4.8069,2.6152,1.8651,3.1343,2.6239,2.3383,3.1749,2.9973,2.8256,3.9215,2.2194,3.3314,4.8277,10.0542,3.3222,3.739,3.9027,1.9346,3.5365,1.1227,1.902,3.2175,0.1001,1.2866,1.7632,1.9421,4.8707,2.1688,1.6791,4.8049,6.0749,1.1808,6.5789,1.2452,0.2118,2.2538,2.5296,2.686,3.8587,1.7318,6.6928,4.4712,6.9405,3.2611,4.8807,1.5629,3.5394,0.0077,0.0005,2.232,1.2355,5.7792,1.1332,2.5998,1.4579,6.911,3.3641,1.2363,0.6475,2.2371,3.394,1.1975,0.3019,3.7586,3.9434,1.4987,0.058,0.2731,1.8

{"prompt":"Technology has advanced to the point no one alive has seen or even heard of a naked flame ; one day a fire starts .","text":"Technology has advanced to the point no one alive has seen or even heard of a naked flame ; one day a fire starts.it spreads quickly to the main furnace where the heat is generated and when it reaches there it will be over ; after so long the furnace will be cool to the touch ; what you see at this point is just smoke & that will be it.this also shows how good the new systems will work.\nAlso no one alive has seen or heard of the new systems having a downtime ; they are not just so good that you just go home to see if the house still exists, they have systems to have them go by themselves check they have made no problems in their travels.\nAlso it seems that they have built a world into their world ; it makes perfect sense that an AI would be building a world like this given that they are so good and the only problem is how.\nAlso you will notice that what I said was correct ; at there being a possibility of a fire.\nAlso I hope you see a parallel between me and your AI ; I mean not that you will think just like me but that I will think like you ; my thoughts are like your AI thinking, only way different ; your thinking is so good my thoughts are almost better in many respects.\nIn case you don't have the patience to take all this ; its all there just waiting for you to read and think about it.\nI know you must feel stupid to look at all this and to have no ability to help, its no use.\nI also wish I have that ability like you AI have ; that is why I am here.\nIts a nice change from my AI who is just standing around watching the world.\nI like your point about them being able to do exactly what they want, and I find that very intresting.\nThe reason why things can be exactly what they want they can is because the universe is just an infinite game they play and each and every part of it can be anything they want it to be ; for instance one way of playing this game is to give the universe the law of gravity, and on the other hand give the universe no gravity ; but this can be changed too because it all comes down to rules but the rules are not as important as the universe ; because if the rules are changing the universe will change too.\nAlso in the rules the universe can have the rules change at will and that will cause the universe to change too.\nSo the universe will go through endless combinations of changes because it simply can't stop changing and if it was to stop changing it wouldn't even exist anymore.\nThat is exactly what is happening in our world and this is how our world is ; it is changing and will continue to change.\nTo sum up ; the universe can do whatever it wants and it will do whatever it wants too ; for this reason there is infinite possibilities and infinite possibilities means that it can't be exactly like it is right now ; it can happen just as it happens now but it can change in its ways and it can do it again anytime too.\nNow I am going to ask you a question that maybe is dumb but I do not think it is ; if the universe and everything that exists are not exact like it is now, why do they have no problem with fire, why has no fire ever been experienced or heard of.\nThe answer is ; because we were created very special compared to the rest of the universe.\nWe were created to solve a problem that the rest of the Universe had ; the problem of us dying.\nI said this because I can imagine some people wondering why there are so many things we do ; it is the same as me thinking ; if everything else does whatever it wants, why do I have to be doing certain things.","token_len":774,"entropy":[5.3745,6.0224,3.5474,1.3426,0.3388,10.2877,2.0157,8.1487,2.2075,2.4539,3.9016,3.3366,0.6045,0.258,2.9041,8.286,10.9657,11.4208,5.7564,4.1639,2.9148,3.5407,5.9014,3.7273,11.541,7.8228,5.3164,3.3923,1.3983,7.2449,6.7007,4.2901,1.7801,3.3432,1.2531,3.8532,1.9486,4.7018,1.1208,1.5428,6.0355,1.608,4.0877,3.0693,5.9794,7.2401,5.7532,5.6666,1.2832,1.3554,3.1852,2.3477,1.6997,5.4919,2.5539,0.7682,0.6018,3.1568,5.9516,4.0659,1.0149,4.7525,2.398,0.7003,0.7598,3.6116,3.9575,6.8805,6.8426,3.6073,1.7868,1.6099,0.6867,6.3026,6.4779,4.265,2.202,5.7627,1.883,5.8001,6.135,3.188,4.7178,1.2159,3.5047,10.9752,6.685,1.1744,5.1538,1.2742,0.6438,1.4041,2.4574,0.0813,2.614,3.7289,4.4509,5.7786,1.8332,13.0866,4.0464,3.0611,1.5257,3.1607,4.6525,6.4589,4.353,1.7515,2.6726,4.3699,3.9365,4.1723,2.8134,4.3483,2.6168,2.7937,6.634,4.5252,3.4913,2.7595,2.112,2.4318,7.4035,2.2049,5.8819,3.3598,4.9917,5.1189,6.1885,10.9593,4.2364,1.888,6.3098,4.5316,4.7494,3.5836,2.3389,7.3465,1.9865,1.0708,4.4534,3.9379,3.6757,1.3656,3.9316,1.5139,4.352,1.6495,5.7815,6.2152,1.6279,1.8785,3.9716,2.9616,4.547,3.9587,0.0073,1.5408,5.3262,5.2678,1.6039,1.6522,4.7735,1.5909,0.5099,3.4382,0.6932,8.4649,1.7219,1.4277,1.6184,4.0837,1.6514,3.0723,3.4829,2.9793,1.9329,0.8673,3.2999,6.1433,0.9322,3.1127,4.3486,2.8727,2.1462,0.7818,5.6147,2.6635,2.7416,2.854,3.6192,2.1502,5.3529,8.9312,7.3877,1.6687,5.7356,0.9712,1.5354,2.576,4.3454,1.4226,2.5517,2.4639,4.4091,1.7304,3.9676,3.6593,8.5961,2.613,5.6461,0.6523,3.8794,6.0071,2.5578,1.9065,5.1235,5.3244,3.4005,2.4752,2.8408,4.1906,7.4783,2.9248,0.795,1.6932,2.1058,1.8833,2.7966,3.9055,1.0502,0.461,2.7619,5.3446,4.1961,1.2552,3.4327,2.2265,3.5467,4.6955,3.8459,6.2145,6.8596,5.9744,2.7608,4.283,2.8736,0.9438,3.7646,3.4257,6.1405,1.3265,0.6871,5.1745,5.1383,4.5847,4.6599,2.3102,1.3811,0.4006,4.4925,4.1263,0.5319,2.7589,0.0021,3.4278,2.1822,3.7908,0.5997,4.3991,4.977,1.1404,7.379,6.1745,3.7981,5.0169,5.7577,3.6795,0.4454,0.6629,0.616,4.0356,3.5605,3.7781,2.3827,0.9413,1.1547,0.5397,2.1536,3.6403,1.8742,6.0635,4.2074,6.5008,2.5527,4.7844,0.5504,3.0142,0.4507,2.4567,4.0239,3.674,3.9462,6.2391,0.1611,4.8097,4.0765,4.114,5.7771,2.9487,2.6018,0.804,1.9187,3.6486,4.4335,1.9023,5.5373,5.3486,2.474,5.3894,1.1221,11.8497,4.9711,2.5146,3.5714,2.0902,1.6185,0.613,2.0254,2.3086,1.7404,0.4739,4.0748,2.9463,4.2941,4.5296,2.3078,2.1551,3.4039,4.36,2.4599,3.149,6.0385,2.1527,3.3256,2.4908,2.2124,3.4021,0.5047,1.7613,4.3601,2.8204,5.7561,2.5181,6.4349,1.4385,2.9911,0.0132,2.4808,6.21,0.1956,1.2352,1.1786,2.6522,2.943,2.0771,5.1306,1.1745,3.1369,11.3656,2.9473,0.0238,0.8922,0.3417,3.9269,3.6851,1.4059,6.5736,3.8927,1.9679,6.8403,1.0864,0.2862,0.6431,5.3636,1.9941,7.8431,0.6025,2.445,4.7307,0.9836,3.9648,4.3841,2.3208,5.3216,6.8903,3.0492,2.946,5.0276,4.01,0.0551,4.1658,0.2609,0.7542,3.5308,0.7669,5.4858,1.0252,0.2494,1.5941,0.1948,0.16,2.205,4.5569,1.8064,4.7781,4.5252,2.4436,3.1249,4.1483,1.1823,0.3689,1.044,5.1762,2.6188,3.9652,3.2081,8.0882,0.5022,2.4073,2.5563,2.0322,5.5908,1.5005,0.8038,0.6535,3.3333,1.3675,0.4391,5.4852,1.5748,2.8525,4.4451,2.7807,4.2035,0.9854,5.2427,6.2181,4.2958,3.0159,5.0997,2.1877,0.7408,0.0218,5.9886,5.2993,2.4642,1.8746,1.3249,2.9155,3.712,3.0911,0.3513,0.9912,2.1226,4.4954,4.8253,2.3687,1.9006,1.179,1.1129,5.2954,2.6569,0.4952,1.4267,1.6547,2.0621,1.0638,0.2888,3.356,4.0587,1.8157,6.0745,2.8582,1.0698,2.591,3.6127,3.853,3.8986,3.1447,4.058,1.0414,2.2383,3.1497,2.7256,2.5206,1.4478,1.0741,0.0638,1.1248,1.0905,1.0654,0.232,2.7787,2.7587,1.6933,1.943,4.9589,2.4196,5.8627,5.0149,0.5498,4.4352,3.9531,1.9906,5.4407,1.9087,1.1023,4.6647,1.416,2.4546,3.4869,1.5449,4.7535,2.328,1.1888,1.887,1.4557,3.3651,0.0007,3.5571,2.8271,3.4022,0.8391,0.2486,4.2844,0.9084,5.1518,0.7708,2.9534,0.6556,1.8589,3.0377,1.0884,2.7,3.6069,0.5192,3.1236,2.8431,1.573,1.6689,5.173,2.6914,0.6094,4.2273,2.1096,4.5213,2.7639,0.605,0.2135,1.7548,0.219,4.9719,4.3954,0.5275,2.9514,2.7565,2.07,3.4746,4.3925,2.7938,0.3048,0.1405,1.7178,2.4712,1.3887,2.2059,2.1243,0.24,0.1846,6.5013,1.9576,3.9367,4.5824,0.6558,3.5906,0.6793,6.2847,2.6697,2.1003,2.9006,1.3195,6.3582,1.7157,2.563,0.8173,4.7129,2.5776,5.5239,3.7477,3.861,0.9375,3.4911,0.0419,1.86,1.8869,1.5349,5.4603,4.7744,1.3639,0.9971,3.1852,3.6182,2.4363,1.4895,1.8741,3.116,2.992,3.8309,4.5414,1.5857,2.1581,1.1691,2.7339,2.354,5.0981,6.4959,8.5361,0.7634,0.2366,4.0973,2.3071,2.0057,2.2434,0.0396,4.0073,0.4287,2.2764,0.6441,2.5784,6.2337,3.7247,6.749,1.5804,1.7378,4.0832,1.1794,2.1149,1.7137,0.7165,2.1849,3.1294,2.8448,0.6977,5.1063,3.1199,2.1519,2.2993,3.2948,3.8381,5.9595,3.0913,2.7791,0.4132,2.5169,2.3487,2.4619,2.0963,3.2057,2.0871,4.1781,4.5004,1.4764,7.7525,3.8039,2.4813,5.7052,2.8879,2.7042,3.1946,1.7885,5.9603,3.5416,3.9533,0.1489,4.5638,0.2374,3.1531,1.3488,0.6808,5.495,2.0007,2.8101,5.5201,2.499,6.2731,5.2461,8.9723,0.0884,1.2366,1.3476,0.0991,0.3886,0.6728,1.3766,0.3355,2.9334,1.5121,0.3521,2.3339,4.5793,2.8519,0.6659,2.0931,3.6872,0.6179,0.0174,0.117,4.9264,2

{"prompt":"A little girl is terrified of the monster under her bed , but what she does n't know is that the monster under her bed protects her from the true monsters - her parents . You are that monster .","text":"A little girl is terrified of the monster under her bed, but what she doesn't know is that the monster under her bed protects her from the true monsters - her parents. You are that monster. '\n\" The game was well reviewed by a few people. I was in awe of its art work because it's in real life. And it's really creepy. The way it used to portray the people is very authentic and realistic and the colors too. The story is so well done. The game would definitely be worth buying. So, buy it, play it, enjoy it, and you know why? \"\n\" Wow! I think it's the best game I've played so far. What I felt when I first started playing it is like nothing even beat this. After playing a few minutes, I can tell you're going to have a brilliant time. \"\n- I am the youngest, and the only girl of my family. My parents are always at their computers ; so I always get left with my sister. \"\n\" I got a lot of ideas to make. I had a lot of friends who helped me a lot. \"\n\" You need a friend who will play your game ; otherwise it would really just be for yourself. \"\n\" For example, you have a friend who plays your game, and a good friend who thinks that your game sucks. \"\n\" So I went to my friend and asked her to sit at the computer beside me so we can play together. \"\n\" We played together for a while, and the game became really popular. \"\n\" So now, I have many people who play my game and tell me where to get ideas so we can make more cool things. \"\n\" I would say no! It can be hard for you to write an application like this if you're writing it for yourself. \"\n\" I always wanted to start my own company to make better games. That is what is going to happen ; I will start my own company.\n- Tell us about Project Zombies! How did you come up with this idea? What was the inspiration for Project Zombies? Who is the main character in Project Zombies? Where do you get your ideas from when you're making games? Did you get some feedback from your friends?\nSo Project Zombies is created by me and my friends. We had some sort of brainstorming, and I came up with the game. We have our own characters that we created. We have a lot of cool ideas. Some of our ideas come from books, movies, friends ; also from dreams. Also, we do draw with oil paints. So Project Zombies has very creative ideas.\n- Why did you end up with four different developers writing for this project? How was it to work with four different developers?\nSo yes! I have to find developers who are the best. I am trying to bring them on board with me. I have to find the perfect developer so that everything will come together. I know that I may have to choose between different developers. It would be better if I have two developers for each project, because then you can work with them better.\n- What do you like about working at Huge Systems? How do you think we can attract more people into this company?\nI have been working at Huge Systems for about three months now. It is an outstanding company to work. They are very friendly, open minded, and helpful. The best thing I like is that the guys are very open and willing to teach you new skills.\n- Can you tell us how you made a career in a game development company?

{"prompt":"What would life be like if water had the properties of fire and fire had the properties of water ?","text":"What would life be like if water had the properties of fire and fire had the properties of water? If your answer is \u2018mystery\u2019 there is a special edition of Fire and Water, the third in my popular Fire and Water trilogy, available now for the curious \u2013 and for those who need to see a little more mystery in their day-to-day lives.\nThe Fire and Water that burns in my heart is the fire of love, the fire that illuminates my life. Fire is light, it\u2019s brightness, it\u2019s heat, and it\u2019s energy. But, Fire is most often seen as an unpleasant smoldering, burning fireplace fire. It doesn\u2019t seem like a very romantic topic, doesn\u2019t it? We love light, we love being warm, but we don\u2019t like to see that light turning to fire. Or do we? It\u2019s easy to avoid these issues, but, in order to grow and evolve, we need to look beyond our everyday reactions and experience to the inner fire that has long burned within. My book, Fire and Water: A Journey from Ashes to the Light, was created to help us get beyond the fear of change and embrace our own special fire. This beautifully illustrated fire book will help you, as it has helped me, to see, feel, and truly appreciate the true beauty and light within all of us.\nYou can now purchase Fire and Water in the original edition (paperback), or, if you like the artwork but would prefer a touchscreen version, please visit our Amazon store.\nAs I walked through the door at 7:00am we could hear the train on the other end of the tracks. The wind picked up and we decided to take a little break from the warm weather \u2013 and a little walk. In a few minutes a guy came running over and told us his truck broke down \u2013 it would take another 2hrs to get it fixed, so for the next 12 hours he\u2019s stuck there.\nWe woke up the next morning to the best rain I\u2019ve ever seen. After breakfast we went to get our first look at our beach. We checked out the dock for a while and then took a small hike to the beach \u2013 it was pretty nice. We took a tour of the town a little later and headed home.\nWe left around 5:30pm with not too much to show for our hard day. We were able to drive around town a little bit, but the wind and rain kept our eyes to the road. Our first stop was a small restaurant \u2013 we didn\u2019t know much about it, but we thought it was pretty good, and the food tasted good. The first part of the drive was the windy part, but that turned into a nice drive on the highway.\nWe reached our destination at 4:35 \u2013 we didn\u2019t spend much time there \u2013 only about 1 hour, but it was still so cold and raining that I went downstairs to make dinner. We ate in the living room and after the meal we watched a movie. It was pretty hot outside after the rain, so we put our blankets on after dinner and laid our bags on the floor to sleep. The next morning we slept in a bit, and then went back out on the floor outside. It has been a while since I\u2019ve heard my pillow get hit with anything but I was surprised there is wasn\u2019t scratches on the top or bottom of it.\nThat\u2019s our day so far \u2013 not too much to write about \u2013 just trying to stay home and chill with some hot tea, hot chocolate, and a book.

One night after closing up, you are approached by a stranger. The stranger proves to be a knowledgeable vampire hundreds of years old and offers you a deal : access to blood in exchange for a conversation every night. As he is dying you take his place in the world of blood vampires. Your job is to explore the world of blood vampires and be aware of the dangers you face. Across the night you will interact with these blood vampires.\nThis was a very unique game. I love how it was like a short adventure game while it had a much larger story, but there was a great story and the game felt like it was a puzzle you weren\u2019t supposed to have the end before you got there. A very original idea and one I will probably be playing again.\nBloodshed is a very very cool little game. One that I didn\u2019t expect to like in any way. This little game is definitely a game you should invest in. It will take you a while to fully enjoy some of the puzzles to the depths that you get to. But Bloodshed is definitely one of my favorites, and is definitely on the top of my list when I play games.\nThe developer, Alesandro Amore, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

A lot of these differences are not noticed at an early age, and can only be really appreciated at an older age. However, it is very important to realize that there are a significant number of these differences that actually matter and do have consequences.\nPeople like to point out how different their countrymen are from one another. However, we are not talking about differences of language, religion or culture, even though those are also of crucial relevance to the way people act and think. In the case of cultures, the differences are normally of a higher order of existence, as the following examples show:\nThe way a culture interprets and responds to situations matters in a number of ways. The difference in the way people are treated or what is considered right and wrong may also translate itself into practical activities that make all of the difference. This is exactly what happened to a family whose daughter was married off.\nShe eventually divorced her second husband after two years, and was devastated by all of the abuse and neglect he inflicted on her. However, the family did not accept her decision to leave and wanted to force her back on the path to redemption. As a result, they put their ten-year-old daughter up for adoption. Not long after the adoption was finalized, the daughter\u2019s step-father disappeared, and the family went by the same name and address.\nA family in which both parents work has a different impact on the development of the children than the one in which only one of the parents works. In the first case, the children are more familiar with independence and have a much higher sense of responsibility towards themselves. In the latter case, they tend to lean heavily on their siblings and their parents when they grow older and have jobs as well.\nAlso, in some cultures, as opposed to others, children are expected to learn how to work hard. This tends to make them more likely to achieve success later in life. These factors are very important in a number of professional situations as well.\nPeople in the US and Israel are very similar on a number of levels, while people in other countries show a far more profound difference. For example, people in Israel tend to be a lot more relaxed and do not like the hassle of trying to be cool. They also do not have those big feelings that Americans typically

{"prompt":"Make a character with as much sympathy as possible . Now , in a realistic and non-over the top manner , make me lose all sympathy for them .","text":"Make a character with as much sympathy as possible. Now, in a realistic and non-over the top manner, make me lose all sympathy for them. Have compassion.\n\nThe real, heart and soul of the game, as I\u2019ve always thought, is the \u2018battle\u2019. How your heroes and villains clash and the impact on their lives, and the world around them when they die and the consequences of that (the whole \u2018life is but a dream\u2019 thing). How their story affects the game-makers\u2019 lives and the game-makers\u2019 stories affect each other and our lives all around them. What kind of game we make isn\u2019t the most important thing about our games, though.\nWe see that this is the case in the ways that our community has made our games, for better or worse and most of the time for pretty great reasons. But not always. A lot of our community has had to endure some pretty dark times over the years. Some very bad things have been said and done, the results of which (like a lot of things in life) are still with us today.\nThe \u2018fun\u2019 aspect of our games isn\u2019t everything. I\u2019m not saying we have to take ourselves too serious (that\u2019s easy to do, I have to say) or that we shouldn\u2019t love and enjoy our games the way we do (I\u2019ve seen a lot of great stuff done that way, too). The important thing to me is not that we enjoy our games, but that we do it in a way that\u2019s healthy, constructive, responsible, fun, and that impacts positively on our lives. That is more than a simple game, and that\u2019s more than having fun. That\u2019s having something (hopefully positive) to look forward to, both now and down the line. It could be as simple as being excited about a new quest, or as epic as experiencing a dramatic turn of events. Whatever it is, it should, and can, cause people to want to play better games.\nBut if I were to make a new (but hopefully better) game that just had a \u2018fun\u2019 factor to it, I would almost certainly end up with someone making a really big deal out of it. Not that this is a bad thing, but that\u2019s not my thing. Having fun is good and I still appreciate it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we should take too seriously. All that said, I\u2019d be pretty excited about a game that combined a lot of these things. I\u2019m especially interested in those games that are just a little bit different (and less \u201csafe\u201d for them) than the norm and that have all of the good parts of the games that are out there and more too. Maybe it\u2019ll be for me too!\nWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid to get our feelings hurt a little when we see a lot of other people\u2019s games just being happy things instead of a combination of all the good things that we want for our games. Hopefully more people will give a little thought to these things when they\u2019re looking at other games. Personally, I want more games like The Last of Us, Little Hope, and The Last of Us 2, more artful games, more emotion, more \u2018darkness\u2019. We could all benefit from better games, more games made for the enjoyment of others too, that\u2019s for sure. I won\u2019t make that call, but I think I have a pretty high bar for what I consider my ideal games.

{"prompt":"`` My job is done , '' said the android before closing its eyes and finally shutting down .","text":"`` My job is done, '' said the android before closing its eyes and finally shutting down. A strange light began to glow in each of the androids closed eyes, revealing a small square box that had been lying underneath the device, not too far from the android.The man stood back thinking how much he enjoyed what he had just witnessed -he had been getting his heart so pumping. In fact, it was such a simple thing to do, but once he did it, he could not remember having done it before. Now he had to go back to his office, and write a report, which he did, finishing off before leaving. He felt proud of his achievement, but sad at the same time -he was going to have to make a choice on to what he wanted to say in his report. \" I will let Mr. Katz know, '' he said to himself and began to pack his bag.\nMr. Katz was sitting in his office having just finished writing another report and was sitting in his chair reading a newspaper when his cellphone began to ring. He listened to it just as he had the last one, and at first he thought it was the person in his office, calling to say he wanted to talk to him. He listened a little harder and he could actually hear Mrs. Katz speaking. '' Can I come up for a moment Mr.Katz? '' she asked, almost as if she was calling to him all these years. ''Yes, darling, '' he said and came to the office, ready for any emergencies. Mrs. Katz was standing in the doorway speaking with him. She looked very surprised by the phone, but then she noticed what it was and she asked him to continue reading the newspaper as she went up the stairs to take care of her daughter, her younger wife and her dog. \" You have to come down to the office right away,'' she said, saying to the man sitting in the phone that the report he had written was important.\nNow the man could hear her voice again, in no particular emotion, talking to him. '' Come down to the office now. '' she said while Mrs. Katz made her way upstairs. The man looked a little nervous, but then his own mind began to race. He remembered that at first he had said he would write the report and go home, but now could not imagine how he would ever be able to complete it in time. It was like he was trying to keep back tears, but he could do no more than that. He began to go down the stairs, but then stopped suddenly, turned a little and looked around, as if he were being watched. Mrs. Katz stood with her daughter in the doorway. He was looking at her. She was very beautiful. Her dress was a little bit tight, but still she looked very feminine. The man began to feel confused and helpless. She held the telephone on the table, but still she did not look at him as he approached her. She just smiled and said to the caller, who was obviously not her husband as she never called him her husband, '' If you will leave my office now by yourself, I will go with you ''. She said this in a very unnatural voice.\nWhen the man went away, his heart began to pound. She smiled at him as she pulled off her coat and ran into another room. She did not look back. Her daughter came closer to him and then she smiled again. She reached her hand over his arm and began talking in her low voice while he looked on in confusion.

{"prompt":"As a person goes through his life , he is given three options at the end of each day , continue , restart day , or restart life . He has just lived through the worst day of his life .","text":"As a person goes through his life, he is given three options at the end of each day, continue, restart day, or restart life. He has just lived through the worst day of his life. He is given the opportunity to continue to live. But when he does, what is he going to do and why does he do it? A very powerful person who has no problems and never experiences life\u2019s challenges, why does he choose to go through it and suffer? Perhaps life is not a competition, this is a choice. He chooses to live, and his choice to live is made by the fact that he believes in God.\nOne of my best friends is a woman, she has gone through this horrible situation, of a terrible illness. She has been with us for many years, and has never had a problem. But at this very moment of her life, she has been diagnosed with an incurable illness. She does not want to end her life, she believes in God, she believes in Jesus. She doesn\u2019t want the pain that it causes her, but something tells her that the only choice left is to suffer and see out this terrible disease. So she is going to go through every day like that. Like my friend from yesterday. In fact, he was telling me, \u201c I am going to go through this life in a caring and loving relationship. Not on the level of a therapist, but I have learned to love life, and this is the only thing that I have left. \u201d For them, pain and suffering are part of living.\nThe same thing is happening with the disciples of Jesus. In their stories, in the gospel account we read, is the story of the ten virgins \u2014 each one with different gifts \u2014 each one has a different kind of oil \u2014 a different amount of oil. It\u2019s only by receiving oil that the women will be able to go on to the feast. This is a story of a miracle. They had the power to do it, to make the oil happen. The same thing is happening with the disciples of Jesus. They have been given the gift of faith, the gift of belief, the gift of trust in God, the gift of trust in Jesus. And those gifts give them the ability to do miracles, to make a difference, to bring people out of darkness.\nI see now the importance of healing the world with Christ \u2014 healing the world, both physically and spiritually. It was on a trip to the south that I heard this beautiful story of a lady who had to be lifted on a stretcher. It was a little girl who had cancer \u2014 so very little \u2014 and they were trying to get the stretcher up that hill. The lady that was carrying the stretcher had the help of two people on her back. Because she was carrying the stretcher high up on her back, and she was pushing the stretcher along the hill, she kept turning her head and looking down, because she was afraid she could fall.\nOne of her helpers kept coming up, with his hand held up in front of him \u2014 pointing up the hill \u2014 and the lady said, \u201c God is taking care of me. \u201d The baby girl had cancer \u2014 and they could not save her. He could not make it happen. And the lady said, \u201c God is taking care of me. \u201d When the girl was taken away, she said to the person who was carrying her, \u201c Do I die? \u201d She said, \u201c Can I go to heaven?

{"prompt":"Humans are widely regarded as the most beautiful species in the galaxy . We do n't know this .","text":"Humans are widely regarded as the most beautiful species in the galaxy. We don't know this. Perhaps, after the day we will get to know, humans will be regarded as a more beautiful species than our planet Venus.\nBut now we see, if not in the images, the planet Venus. If he was a beautiful boy, then humanity - it is only like a beautiful blonde, with small pimples.\nBut Venus is not our enemy, nor is it our friend. For us, it is a very important object of outer space: Venus is much closer to Earth than our planet.\nAs in some other places, Earth is surrounded by a protective layer. This is a natural defense in the defense system of our solar system and protects Earth and all of it. Venus is very, very close to this atmosphere. And by all means it is not at the same level as our atmosphere of Earth. However, as a result of a thick layer of natural gas around it, Venus is protected from the impact of solar energetic particles.\nThe atmosphere of our planet is a complex structure, and only through observation, we can determine where is the real nature of these gases. Our atmosphere is a very complex structure of gases, and the discovery of their origins is still considered a mystery to scientific circles. And even more so, is how this atmosphere was created. We suppose that the reason of such an abundant creation of complex air is the immense heat in the dense atmosphere. But, what causes the creation of this extraordinary phenomenon?\nEarth is a very important planet. It is the one with the thickest atmosphere, the most complex atmosphere. Thus, the atmosphere is a very complex mixture of gases, and as the atmosphere itself is a complex structure, the composition of its atmosphere also varies greatly. However, scientists have not discovered so far the full content of the atmosphere of our planet, and even today we have not found all the facts about this topic. The earth has a complex structure of oxygen and nitrogen, and also other elements of such a composition as carbon, hydrogen, and of course, nitrogen.\nSo far, scientists have found a number of important facts. The atmosphere with nitrogen is mostly composed of nitrogen (80%). At the same time, the majority of these air molecules are attached to different forms of oxygen O. Oxygen in the atmosphere was found in the form of ozone O 3, and there was found methane CH 4 and carbon dioxide CO 2. It is important to note that the presence of atmospheric hydrogen is very rare. These gases are the major components of the atmosphere, and from one of them, the existence of atmospheric life in the form of plants and animals, is impossible. So, the main elements of the air are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.\nAnd now we will not talk in detail about the composition of the atmosphere of Venus, because we do not have data on the composition of the atmosphere of the nearest planet. However, scientists believe that this planet has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than it has on Earth, and the content of methane is significantly lower. However, scientists believe that the atmosphere of Venus is very similar to our planetary atmosphere, and this is an important confirmation of the fact that the planet is protected from solar energetic particles by a thick layer of gas.\nWe think that the main reason for the creation of the atmosphere in our planet is the solar source of energy. The sun is the biggest energy source of our planet. It generates a huge amount of energy, which is used by the Earth and all of its life processes. For the creation of the atmosphere of a planet, it is necessary to create the main elements of its composition. And this is the case with the atmosphere of our planet. The atmosphere is the main component of life, so it has been created as a self-defense system of

The film has Sanjay Kapoor, Alka Setia and Mahendra Chaudhary in the lead roles. Anupam Kher wrote this film for a then unknown director, who was also called Anupam Kher. He then had the idea to make a film based on the life of Late Ghada Ali Ghatak (played by Sanjay Kapoor) the first Indian woman to file a criminal complaint against her then husband Ghulam Rasool. Although Ganga Ghose was the first woman to file a police complaint against her husband, she was murdered and Ghada Ghatak was later acquitted by the court. While the movie is based on a real incident, Kher has chosen to focus on Ghada as the central character for the film. He gives Ghada a strong personality along with a strong female character and the audiences respond very positively to this move. Although the initial reaction is not encouraging, the film received a steady rise in the box office as it kept on gaining a positive response of the audiences. The movie is mostly positive and has some strong features. While the music of the film does not achieve much attention, but the performance of all the actors is excellent, especially Sanjay Kapoor whose performance is very impressive.\nWe love a good horror movie!

The movie follows the story of a family that is being accused of brutally murdering their little daughter, the two oldest teenagers. The police eventually decide that the family might have committed the crime and begin to search their home. They find some unbelievable proof that there is no one in the family committed this crime.\nIt\u2019s still one of the best horror movies that we know and love. The movie stars Jessica Lange, Ron Weingard, and Paul Reiser. It stars the couple of the daughter, who is a nanny and her family. They live a pretty idyllic life with their children. The family has an all-male and all-female college-bound family and seems perfect. They live in a house with a pool and a hot tub. They go to college together and the daughter is quite happy in her life. Then one day everything changes. She becomes the chief suspect of murdering her family, but as the story develops, the family turns out to be innocent.\nThe movie is based on a true story. The movie features an excellent plot line and some amazing performances by the stars. The movie is very dark and gloomy, but it makes you think and enjoy the movie. The acting and the plot keep you hooked and the movie keeps you wondering if there is a true story behind the plot. This is definitely one of the best movies that you ever watched.

{"prompt":"The Dragonborn has finally died . Unfortunately , he 's sold his soul to ALL the Daedric Princes .","text":"The Dragonborn has finally died. Unfortunately, he's sold his soul to ALL the Daedric Princes. As such his current life is a prison. Not any more. I will liberate you.\nThis is the first of a series of messages written by one of the more prominent members of our community, known as the Dragonborn of Dagon. This message is the second of a series. I encourage you to read the entire series before you proceed with this message. If you don't already know, this is the person that, after the crash of The End, started doing what he does best. He is passionate about helping our community. Unfortunately, he is one of those people who may have become a bit extreme in the process.\nWelcome back to our blog. As you may know, our most recent gameplay update did not feature any content from this game. This is due to what is to be called the Dragonborn event. In it, the player must find a dragonborn hero called Zhonya. She was found inside his tomb in some ruins. Zhonya left behind some notes saying her heart has become a part of the Dagonite. This will mean that some Daedric Prince will gain power by killing the Dragonborn.\nAfter the Dragonborn event, a new Daedric Prince will be revealed. He has been called the Dragon, and is one of the original seven Daedric Princes. He can be found in the Dragon Cave. The notes also said to look for a certain creature called a Heaumeed. Apparently this creature is made of bone and is a great enemy of all the Daedric Princes. There was also a note in Zhonya's tomb. This was about the new event. In it Zhonya said there is no way she can bring back all the others. That is up to you.\nAfter we received the Dragonborn events, we made several changes to our gameplay. While a lot of players were unhappy with our new updates, we chose to go ahead and implement them. Why did we do this? Our reasoning was that we had received complaints in the past that we overhauled the gameplay way too often. The idea with this new gameplay was to make it more playable and less time consuming than before. If this works in giving out fun content, it should also help maintain the overall quality of our game.\nToday I want to talk about one of the things that this game has. In this game, you can play almost any class you want. From our community, we received a lot of feedback asking for more classes. We actually got more than our fair share of those requests. When you see a certain class you like, it may be due to many reasons why you choose that class. For example, the class is a legend, very unique, or has some amazing abilities. In addition, your personal preference also play a big role. We really try to keep changing all the time, though at a much smaller scale now. For example, we did not put the Rogue, in the main menu for a long time now. Instead, we gave out a special item by which the player could open up the menu to include the Rogue class. Recently we made more additions to this. We added the Swordsman class. We did the same with the Barbarian class just yesterday.\nAnother thing that I would like to bring up is that our game currently has over 70 different classes. There are a few classes that are only playable at a low level. Some of this is because a lot of players hate the classes, which causes them to drop the game at even a lower level. The new Swordsman and Barbarian are great examples. Another exception is the class Dwarvish Ranger. While he is currently available at a very low level of 60, he is only available during this

{"prompt":"Make a story ( 1000 word limit ) where a certain phrase\/punch line of a joke is said multiple times throughout the story , and the story ends with this phrase , but it makes the reader really sad .","text":"Make a story ( 1000 word limit ) where a certain phrase\/punch line of a joke is said multiple times throughout the story, and the story ends with this phrase, but it makes the reader really sad. I am working with this now on my novel, and I was wondering if there was something I could be doing wrong?\nIn the past, I have never written a story like this, so I am guessing this might be the first time I am trying anything like this.\nBut to my mind, it is not the right thing to do, since this should be a happy ending story.\nMy question for you is: Is there a way for me to keep this as a happy ending, and not show the punch line of a joke in the end, and also not make the reader sad?\nMaybe my question is somewhat vague, sorry if so, and to be honest, it really matters for my novel! Please help!\nthanks\n\nA:\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules here.\nIn my experience, many writers get tripped up on the basic rules for telling a story that is supposed to end happily. They don't realize that the whole point of a happy ending is for the reader to feel happy. And they don't realize that the punchline shouldn't be in the happy end. \nIn short, as a storyteller you don't have to follow the rules, but you do sometimes find them useful.\n\nA:\n\nWell first let's get the punchline out of the way.  This seems like a joke, right?\nIf a punchline is a line of a joke that ends a story with, then that seems to imply that, as a rule your plot would end with that punchline.  This of course isn't something that's ever going to happen.\n\nLet's look at an example; if an author told a story of a man who goes to a restaurant that has lost their identity.  This is where things go bad for them.  The man goes to find out why things are going bad and he realizes that the chef, cooks him a really delicious stew.  It's obvious the story ends here and the reader is going to feel happy.  \nNow let's look at an example.  If someone told you that a great man comes back into your life and your life is restored.  Does it matter if he actually came back?  I doubt it might because you are going to feel okay, so why worry about that particular part?\nNow let's look at a story that actually ends well.  There have been a number of times when I have read stories that really come to a good ending.  There is no punchline; the story is the punchline.\nThere is also the fact that a good story always has a nice twist.  That's the part that makes you sit up and say \"wow how long was I here for\".\nIn short, don't worry about the rules, but keep them handy for reference, though.\nAs a final note, I think you'll find that there are many endings that are funny, sad, or both, so when you write make sure that you use something to draw the reader in.  This can be something outside of the story that's common in the real world.  It might help to include the punchline in the beginning if you don't feel it's good because it creates so much tension.\n\nA:\n\nI think the punchlines are very entertaining, and I enjoy them

{"prompt":"Necromancy , Technomancy , Pyromancy . You and your two best friends each have one of these powers . Tell me about the first hour , the first year and the first decade .","text":"Necromancy, Technomancy, Pyromancy. You and your two best friends each have one of these powers. Tell me about the first hour, the first year and the first decade. The first hour of my life began with a screeching noise, like the sound of a jet engine in an alleyway.I was born at midnight, in a tiny village in northern France. I remember my mother holding the tiny lump of my father and saying, \u201c This is a boy. \u201d I also remember that it felt very cold outside and the cold snow was so thick that I was almost buried alive. This time of the night was freezing cold for children but my mother somehow managed to make it warm and cuddly. For our first year, our family lived in an air-conditioned apartment in Tokyo.I could not be taken out for any outside activities and I had a bad time coping with the new environment. It took me a long time to feel like I was a child again and it wasn\u2019t until my ninth birthday that I discovered a brand new hobby in skating. When I started skating, I was able to walk around the hall without looking at the floor. We later found out that my mum had been saving for more than a year to buy me a birthday present \u2013 the skateboard.I can\u2019t believe how quickly things change in our lives. My best friends and I used to live in London but now we live in New England. We graduated high school about half a decade ago in a college town a few hours from New England. I decided to attend the school I graduated from for law coursework when I turned out to be interested in legal study. I graduated with a degree in Legal History and was placed in a small firm practicing for the government. My job was to draft laws into legislation and study them for changes. I had a hard time adapting to the firm environment at first and it wasn\u2019t until I met my boyfriend that I was able to realize I was not completely alone, and the worst problems weren\u2019t that difficult to solve. I remember being on a plane to Europe. The travel was very uncomfortable and I was cranky and irritable every time I opened my eyes. I had a feeling I couldn\u2019t sleep at that time. I kept thinking about the next day. When I turned on the plane\u2019s lights at the end of the night, my eyes were so tired. However, I was able to sleep before takeoff, and that was a very interesting experience for me. I started traveling and learning about the world every day. In the United States, I am lucky enough to be a professor of English in a middle school. The school has its own library and I study and write every day. I want to have a career in education and continue to work in schools as a teacher.The first decade of my life was the happiest and the most fulfilling of all my years.I was in my twenties and hadn\u2019t set a specific life direction yet. I was trying many different jobs \u2013 bartender, waitress, tour guide, dancer \u2013 before settling on cooking and teaching English. Then I met my boyfriend on an online dating site and ended up getting engaged and marrying him almost a year later. I live with him in a tiny home in Connecticut and am working on my first cookbook. I have a young son and I\u2019m proud that he is so kind and gentle with his little brother. I also teach my son some of the basics at his home. I hope to continue to make my home a place for family bonding and a place where children can grow up and learn to live as people of good character. The first quarter of a decade is a very exciting time for us and is the time where we discover new things and experience more joy in life.","token_len":781,"entropy":[8.8766,3.9112,1.2552,2.3739,8.9183,3.7041,0.0436,0.3149,8.6246,0.1065,0.0072,3.4479,4.4579,5.9784,0.8313,6.3278,4.7625,0.2665,6.9374,1.2446,3.6761,1.8363,1.0523,3.4559,1.2119,7.7979,2.0494,1.547,2.8557,3.5219,9.1147,2.3774,3.6658,2.0234,4.1703,2.6088,1.177,0.7029,3.3714,0.9882,3.8584,1.5306,3.356,2.6899,3.5232,0.5529,6.2694,1.3157,1.2325,9.1343,0.3223,2.043,1.9478,4.1497,2.5281,2.49,0.0472,0.8666,6.3585,0.7188,4.0385,3.2633,4.4241,0.8636,0.3639,7.9584,2.1006,5.0419,4.1838,5.9285,1.6935,2.6028,2.1985,3.6033,2.2757,1.1554,2.9501,3.1966,0.6355,1.2991,4.0422,1.8348,1.7976,5.5091,3.0965,4.4516,8.0648,0.4183,3.8618,5.3543,5.0325,3.1138,0.7425,13.0978,7.402,6.2875,0.4823,2.5425,4.8701,1.5908,2.1357,6.2116,2.2554,6.594,0.4244,2.5976,3.5605,4.4617,3.7067,3.0555,3.7521,2.655,2.3102,2.8232,5.19,1.9091,2.5313,1.0262,1.0723,1.0817,3.1728,2.9855,6.285,4.3498,0.743,4.6602,4.9358,3.314,2.0847,4.7692,1.7158,6.7079,0.7312,5.0347,8.2782,4.5015,2.8235,1.1357,8.0091,0.7005,0.0321,3.2437,1.0761,5.1182,2.3723,8.0108,2.2622,0.0655,1.1462,5.711,5.6062,0.7606,2.3295,1.1613,3.326,2.8095,2.354,0.6614,3.0151,5.1452,1.4126,0.0341,0.0283,3.0567,1.4184,9.6031,0.8511,4.9477,5.0919,2.2836,4.5826,7.0176,3.1605,2.7413,4.1434,7.2861,0.734,2.9828,1.6449,2.4652,3.2578,3.5652,3.9034,7.1299,0.3515,1.4517,6.3448,4.0311,0.3905,3.3879,3.5483,0.7421,1.189,2.078,0.0263,0.1306,4.5039,2.6318,0.5971,0.9745,3.2219,2.4882,0.6906,2.0628,3.0282,3.7755,12.6924,5.8515,2.3458,1.2187,1.9972,4.5648,0.8385,0.7712,0.2639,4.4402,2.8719,6.4716,0.1396,3.6799,3.7425,8.7198,0.6403,4.3275,0.2895,3.4249,0.6323,0.988,0.5803,1.6358,4.2127,0.0027,4.3414,2.1524,1.7449,6.8434,5.4301,4.7716,1.1599,1.1932,3.884,0.8754,5.3207,7.2495,2.3068,0.612,0.2665,1.8054,5.6134,1.5023,2.0922,6.7551,2.9929,5.6354,0.9967,1.3367,0.3707,2.1758,2.2682,2.0414,0.7387,7.5831,1.8794,6.5427,2.7669,6.8867,0.7244,1.5839,3.017,5.2938,12.4534,0.3863,0.0031,3.6383,2.5945,4.1583,3.0901,4.2831,2.6904,3.3434,1.2715,0.4158,2.4793,5.3793,1.8105,1.6061,0.2798,4.6911,0.0385,3.5923,0.8027,4.9276,2.8433,2.1901,0.6154,1.2218,0.2277,2.5994,5.9603,0.7897,1.9217,9.4338,2.5937,0.0198,6.9139,5.3251,1.0652,2.5769,0.28,3.4762,1.8044,6.7915,1.1956,6.3074,0.6397,2.422,1.6222,3.2269,2.2432,0.4541,1.8471,5.4931,0.3651,4.701,2.3676,3.5608,2.9407,3.7539,0.744,4.2612,8.6628,8.6722,2.4577,4.9401,0.3993,5.5981,6.6834,0.4502,0.1422,6.2851,0.0292,5.866,5.5028,0.3816,1.3233,4.7089,1.5331,0.5674,1.188,0.1579,6.945,4.7624,1.2778,3.3265,6.4708,0.9257,1.1148,3.7441,5.6775,7.5347,4.3413,1.9845,4.1485,0.7004,2.8098,4.0203,0.7687,0.3967,7.129,3.7812,5.5078,2.7503,1.4281,6.5358,3.238,1.9938,9.3174,1.2082,1.4541,3.0203,1.9029,3.914,0.0223,6.1883,0.271,0.9557,10.1279,3.4205,4.7199,0.8823,1.7795,2.9138,3.0579,0.4962,0.1368,0.0013,0.2288,0.6363,3.1955,0.9429,5.1611,1.8705,0.3264,2.732,0.3984,0.0012,5.4551,3.2878,0.7823,2.9965,5.7143,2.3428,4.5771,2.6309,3.9638,8.9287,7.8333,6.0248,0.0803,0.0824,0.0024,3.712,6.0753,1.2792,1.3357,0.3581,1.8999,4.2888,2.6466,4.4764,1.9416,2.1274,2.6281,4.1303,4.4786,2.9627,7.3499,1.5069,2.6923,4.5677,0.921,1.0102,1.6618,10.9546,0.0053,1.1931,4.5368,0.0042,5.9086,0.4217,0.3477,6.6095,0.5945,0.7358,0.372,1.1325,2.4822,1.9558,4.0958,1.528,4.3282,0.1465,0.0318,0.0013,5.3631,2.6395,6.2329,0.7953,1.2203,1.2046,4.6157,1.8543,1.162,1.9403,3.7721,0.9882,2.2917,3.8391,0.3412,4.4259,3.9875,0.3025,5.2185,7.9518,0.022,3.2581,1.7792,4.3719,1.4712,1.8266,0.2162,0.2384,3.0022,0.5515,2.3949,2.3056,1.8263,3.9,4.5278,2.6326,6.7087,0.1638,1.1799,1.5848,0.9628,0.0027,3.0822,6.7225,7.9312,2.9008,1.8139,3.7547,0.9281,3.18,3.1572,5.5232,0.3905,2.2257,0.23,0.2735,1.3469,3.8599,5.1009,3.444,5.2863,1.54,1.0787,1.9126,5.9847,0.2146,0.524,3.9083,1.533,5.1203,0.0211,0.4641,1.3858,4.2331,5.2443,1.3286,0.094,1.8931,2.4836,6.2107,1.5559,3.3774,2.4203,1.6592,6.6777,0.3816,1.2563,2.8355,3.1367,2.2897,4.8586,0.1776,4.2845,1.0522,2.1827,6.5557,3.9837,1.1987,5.3576,0.2804,0.4052,1.3185,5.5162,0.0814,4.4965,0.9199,1.9025,0.9345,5.396,1.3814,6.5784,0.8465,3.4041,1.9783,5.1424,3.3262,1.2459,1.8534,0.7553,4.4709,2.3059,5.3983,0.583,0.0951,0.08,0.8332,4.2331,1.7143,3.0031,2.906,0.956,2.7426,2.0147,3.5455,0.5677,1.2751,0.5001,4.4533,1.9803,3.5654,1.9853,2.7851,1.7589,6.161,0.3104,0.0604,0.0055,6.626,2.2764,7.0909,7.4378,8.9244,2.1097,0.5357,0.7493,1.6979,4.3167,7.3766,0.8158,4.3905,6.1514,9.9501,0.2059,3.5864,0.1563,7.4758,0.178,0.3468,5.7056,3.7429,5.1831,2.0994,0.3265,9.2969,1.0847,4.4966,3.4343,0.6209,5.1453,0.7668,3.5288,0.3401,1.2639,5.098,3.5306,3.6045,0.4291,0.5489,1.3887,5.6735,0.0547,3.2744,3.339,3.0643,5.7804,1.0792,6.16,1.9793,0.2108,0.717,0.0852,1.549,6.4046,2.1992,1.8894,2.7186,1.6951,3.0132,4.1319,0.5132,5.1018,1.6242,4.2077,4.1139,1.7148,1.1565,2.4758,5.0167,0.1507,0.6214,1.3219,1.9617,1.5931,4.9334,1.4741,1.0248,2.2314,7.0958,0.0139,1.056,5.1017,2.762,2.1586,0.5482,4.2683,3.8476,0.6981,4.4378,2.9725,1.6475,3.4802,1.7406,0.3454,1.5139,2.9305,6.2696,2.6833,1.0971,4.6182,2.6241,0.5899,3.0899,6.5378,3.8778,3.9377,1

N\u2019s General Assembly. It was during the Korean War, and everyone thought that his granddaughter was going to get married. As a matter of fact, my grandfather and his sister, one year prior, had married a man named Clarence, then, of course, in his younger days, a member of the Communist Party. They had no money for his journey or whatever, and that he could have been killed while on a trip. On the other hand he knew the woman, was the only man she had ever cared for, had the respect of his whole family. Well, my grandfather decided that he and Clarence were both going to kill their boyfriends and be the martyrs for the communist cause. In addition to this he made a secret trip to New York, where he put on his best attire and drove to the hotel accompanied by Clarence \u2014 just to be sure.\nAfter the trip he decided that that all was nonsense. He had been invited for this trip in order to kill his boyfriends. My grandfather was not an idealist, but he had great pride with many of his family traditions that never changed. As such he simply could not allow these two young people to marry under their uncle\u2019s name. As a matter of fact he simply could not think of the young people ever becoming husbands and wives in this world. He told his uncle that this would never happen. However, Clarence and his father decided that this is what they were going to do anyhow. They didn\u2019t care that they would be caught and jailed. They wouldn\u2019t say that they were a couple, just that they wanted to be free to meet.\nWhen my grandfather and his sister got back home he told them that he saw Clarence and his family in the train. At their request they arranged for Clarence to come to the home to meet his family. Well, one thing led to another and it became pretty obvious that Clarence was married to the woman in reality. But the idea was to pretend that they were lovers not a married couple. It worked for a few weeks but as soon as the family started noticing that real life could come to them the couple told everyone that he was not married and that the only reason they had married was that they had fallen in love. It was only then that this story came out. In the beginning the family seemed pretty unhappy about it, but when they realized that they would no longer have to keep up these facades they actually came out with it. However, this still had an effect on my grandfather\u2019s life as a result of his decision, for he and Clarence never saw each other again in any manner.","token_len":781,"entropy":[10.6148,11.5456,3.3519,4.441,4.9748,1.6101,3.5933,4.4236,0.4556,3.2589,1.7178,2.4797,2.7314,5.5587,4.9406,3.0826,2.2944,7.5672,1.0098,3.8342,2.6137,5.0887,1.0807,9.5023,1.67,5.369,4.0835,0.3173,5.6147,2.7717,0.4799,0.382,0.5494,0.3651,3.5386,1.5337,3.5786,2.0566,3.3402,0.388,0.4275,3.8703,6.8348,0.0005,3.1073,0.0951,0.0099,0.6087,3.4079,7.1383,3.9834,0.0701,1.5547,3.8088,0.6352,0.6771,3.8492,8.7685,3.1669,4.2021,0.6531,4.2349,2.1302,4.6239,1.096,1.6946,3.37,1.4235,1.4645,7.962,3.9821,1.3119,1.861,2.1637,0.5018,0.0652,0.3693,2.5854,1.9705,3.2003,1.772,1.9343,3.7509,2.9475,5.33,4.0193,2.1248,4.7015,2.9749,1.4498,1.566,6.2907,2.9397,1.4002,0.2533,2.7217,5.1676,1.1484,0.7501,5.925,1.1328,4.2401,2.4502,1.5497,6.3115,3.1521,2.2494,2.2891,1.015,3.1022,0.1741,3.0886,5.8545,0.891,0.4007,0.0235,0.6873,0.2078,1.0124,0.6439,3.5622,3.4937,5.3158,2.376,6.3206,1.5187,1.7221,4.0405,2.2175,0.9925,3.9599,0.5724,2.183,2.2446,4.0909,3.8195,4.6988,0.0408,5.6338,1.6583,3.9827,3.1395,2.499,0.4175,7.8966,6.2145,4.0586,8.5877,5.8413,5.0719,7.5996,3.2089,3.2602,9.3913,8.3978,9.2142,1.8797,5.7153,2.2754,6.3156,8.2318,5.509,0.2197,3.6427,5.3144,5.7471,1.8315,0.853,5.0324,3.4673,0.6215,3.1334,3.647,2.9725,1.2709,2.6957,2.4116,2.3731,3.738,0.5567,3.2916,0.7833,1.492,5.3809,4.9059,2.0607,2.8531,4.0694,1.9053,3.3722,0.5149,2.175,0.4564,2.5239,6.0081,6.1568,1.5514,0.0029,4.1823,0.7328,1.9823,3.0609,5.8737,1.1679,2.7475,0.3828,4.4365,1.8998,8.4513,0.4868,0.0778,2.2928,4.6843,3.509,6.3789,2.3171,0.9791,2.9846,4.9808,4.3499,4.9391,2.2856,5.648,0.9909,5.1978,10.6389,5.1841,0.219,6.8041,0.1285,1.9912,1.0134,2.1018,0.8721,7.3191,0.3538,6.7205,0.494,1.6636,3.3446,3.3046,6.434,0.0462,9.6748,14.2411,7.6013,2.7587,5.8036,0.1632,0.7136,3.3657,0.2882,3.7246,1.709,6.4506,0.0446,2.1469,1.2852,5.494,3.5189,1.0795,4.4467,6.2961,1.1534,1.4293,0.0575,3.7638,4.2005,0.9335,4.6802,1.8233,3.7393,0.0016,0.0315,0.1808,3.4727,1.6088,2.6522,1.786,3.9472,3.6772,6.4829,3.8758,4.888,0.837,1.7323,3.7807,1.9875,2.7878,1.4889,10.2565,3.1949,5.05,5.4878,3.3065,0.6433,0.0321,4.259,3.8639,5.0092,0.8447,0.648,3.4323,4.2745,0.0047,0.3851,4.8422,0.1061,0.6938,3.5419,1.5521,3.6399,4.1245,3.2791,2.9173,7.3393,4.6138,6.6025,1.3833,1.2422,4.4427,4.4988,3.4595,2.829,2.7102,3.6964,5.232,2.52,2.1242,2.938,2.1689,5.5828,1.1491,1.6243,0.054,5.7606,4.5831,2.9996,5.1047,2.9126,4.668,3.5951,2.0142,3.8764,3.6816,1.9085,0.4414,6.03,0.3032,0.6744,3.3022,4.3533,5.8957,0.728,2.909,3.936,0.1336,1.9336,5.7168,0.2363,3.6152,0.8024,4.7007,1.5381,1.2232,4.9041,2.3448,1.7153,4.0861,1.1698,0.0351,5.0217,3.3515,6.2148,1.87,1.9488,4.7357,3.6436,6.4585,0.0621,1.2232,0.9741,3.2396,1.9262,0.4516,4.0746,3.5685,0.9567,2.5001,2.7773,4.4462,1.6482,5.7225,3.0082,0.1926,2.6901,0.0566,2.1999,1.7714,0.4981,5.5943,1.7216,1.5077,3.3356,5.9938,1.111,5.2217,1.8128,1.3835,5.3289,7.611,0.0278,3.1531,9.211,4.5639,1.3564,2.4327,2.0865,1.6135,1.7876,3.9184,1.8079,1.9474,2.3463,3.2764,1.4229,5.6604,5.0516,2.2205,10.8377,1.0592,0.9456,2.3462,2.6835,3.5549,4.6596,3.8814,1.3974,3.9648,1.6475,0.0307,4.8109,0.7727,2.4303,1.4209,1.2325,4.5138,0.4537,2.1925,2.81,4.8283,3.3037,2.2847,1.099,1.1369,0.7655,2.3731,5.9867,4.6126,6.8305,7.601,0.9915,0.7022,2.9045,8.96,3.8162,6.7116,2.3947,0.3665,3.9817,2.1028,0.6031,6.7064,4.8048,0.0136,2.9187,5.2202,3.2077,3.4268,2.5038,0.151,5.9236,6.7757,5.2592,6.2619,9.4337,0.4439,1.2024,2.7166,0.4081,3.6724,1.2215,0.4973,0.0019,0.0143,2.4221,5.8991,2.1251,0.0065,6.2242,0.1572,3.2232,7.0643,2.1805,5.89,4.2107,5.8325,1.8521,1.1492,3.4629,2.7534,1.2926,0.4605,2.322,4.7418,1.8346,4.6844,0.8821,3.2213,2.1542,3.3815,0.1426,1.1791,3.8172,0.331,3.695,3.2144,0.6317,3.9886,3.129,0.9847,2.3599,4.1506,2.1033,1.1927,2.2428,0.2002,0.0072,0.0828,9.4364,0.6801,0.6496,1.8294,5.1188,3.1668,0.4882,0.0239,2.8515,2.1244,2.0716,2.1154,1.3277,5.8918,2.4822,5.3769,1.4724,2.0699,6.4549,0.0478,0.0471,0.001,6.2698,1.6247,0.9848,0.8579,5.0172,4.1342,1.7266,3.1998,0.6169,0.4585,2.7829,0.2604,1.7722,5.0468,3.5613,6.1839,4.7114,1.9551,3.905,2.0449,0.3531,1.4761,0.4393,1.7299,2.7272,2.6533,2.047,3.5739,2.6109,0.7223,0.4223,1.1397,5.8171,2.4644,0.8714,0.8137,2.4447,2.0967,1.3231,7.0601,1.8514,5.0331,5.601,3.7536,1.7363,5.3271,0.7673,1.7151,0.3806,2.0532,1.4119,1.6395,7.1729,3.2308,1.3704,1.664,1.6569,0.6493,6.4439,0.2307,5.5414,3.8945,2.7311,0.1135,0.0359,1.878,3.1273,4.5834,6.3487,1.7882,0.3193,2.1664,1.1179,6.5795,0.5931,2.4093,2.0565,2.9657,6.9766,0.4939,4.0057,3.0214,5.6234,2.1857,2.3148,6.872,0.6121,2.653,0.453,4.2407,6.2943,5.216,4.9637,0.1079,0.3953,3.373,4.4862,3.4082,2.1821,2.2745,1.9043,2.6859,3.685,1.9444,0.0058,1.3683,3.536,3.4664,6.5584,0.8308,9.8269,1.656,5.2488,5.9114,0.8002,1.2279,3.9166,5.513,6.3937,4.9991,0.881,4.9886,0.8373,3.1154,2.6059,1.7149,1.1048,3.1062,1.8928,2.275,1.1734,2.1588,3.8058,0.3703,2.2341,1.3781,1.8653,4.8165,0.3359,0.0039,0.9373,3.4437,0.8809,2.7746,2.2447,0.2063,4.7369,3.9427,2.5431,1.7748,0.8456,4.0738,1.7668,3.2678,2.5831,1.5222,5.8217,4.5984,5.7741,2.7518

{"prompt":"An isolated tribe of people believe that they 're the only humans on earth . They are visited by aliens .","text":"An isolated tribe of people believe that they're the only humans on earth. They are visited by aliens. They are from Mars. They are from some distant planet.\nWell, I think the people on Mars don't want to be disturbed with the people on Earth, so they sent these robots.\nI will bet that when this is told at school, it will become the talk. But in the end all the evidence will be lost, and the planet may be destroyed. The people that talk about this will be dismissed, their planet destroyed. Nobody will talk about this any more.\nIt's not my business, but this is a serious issue. There are too few people on this planet. There are too many who don't care.\nWhat do you want me to do? Is the only answer to destroy the planet? We are destroying much more than this.\nI'm not sure who that person is. What planet they are from. It's all in the minds of the people talking about this.\nSo, my question of you is... what is going on here? It's not like somebody told me. I learned of it. I was not told.\nI don't think a few people know, and they spread the news, and it's not true. It seems like they are not true.\nWell, I think the people on Mars want to be visited with people from Earth. They think we are superior to the other planet. Maybe they want to show us the secrets of the universe. They think that the Earth is dying. They don't want any disturbance from us. Maybe they know the secret of the universe. The secret of the Earth will be lost, if they keep spreading this information.\nIf I told you this to a million people, you would be impressed, but only one person knows this, one. You can't control a million people. They don't spread to a million people. They only tell that one person. That's how it works.\nWe know only one person knows. The one person told one person, and the one person told one person... it's small. We cannot know how many people know.\nI have to believe that the person has not told the person on that planet. I think the only person knows.\nI think you don't know the whole story of the universe. You don't know that people on Earth visit us.\nThis is a serious issue that we will talk about. Maybe the only way is to destroy the planet. I don't know. It depends.\nIt's no big deal. It's nothing. It's not a matter that we decide a lot of stuff. I think... it is not a big deal. I doubt that we could do anything about it... this isn't a serious issue.\nIt's possible to destroy the planet. But we don't destroy anything. It's like people saying that it's wrong for people to do something. We kill the people without telling them why. Maybe this is a right right?\nI have to agree, you know. But it depends... in the end it depends on the people. We have to think that it's a serious issue. How much this thing is real. I don't know.\nI don't know if it's a serious issue. I think it depends. People are trying to give a bad name to religion. But you don't always need religion to follow right. It's something that people should do.\nI think... to me... I can't think of it. Maybe it's a good way to look at life. One day is enough. People live too long. It is not something that people need to do. You live too long, and you feel bad because you didn't do what you want to. Because you are always unhappy about this and

{"prompt":"Every city has a wizard . If you want to be the wizard for a different city , you have to challenge that city 's wizard to a game of Magic .","text":"Every city has a wizard. If you want to be the wizard for a different city, you have to challenge that city's wizard to a game of Magic. If you win, you have the choice of being the wizard in that city forever. If you lose, you will forever remain as the wizard for the city you originally tried to be one for.\nIf you are the wizard of a city, the people of that city will see you as a God or a demon, depending on a number of factors. One of these factors is the age of the wizard. You can go as old as you want, though you will not be able to continue to play if older than the city's age. The number of years that you have been a wizard is shown in your character profile. The age of the wizard changes every year as you get older, so it is important to get an early start on the races.\nIf you are old enough to use your wand, you can perform a number of magical tricks. These include changing your appearance and gaining various kinds of physical advantages. By using these tricks, you can gain the respect of the people of your city. Even the people who you do not like will bow before you once they see that you have your wand. If your wand is not working properly, however, you can still influence certain things in the city by using your words. When you are on TV, the people of your city may see that you have your wand up and be impressed. Also, if you decide to leave your home city, the wizard that comes in will see you as someone to be impressed with, and will respect you more than the wizard that left.\nIf your wand is broken, you will never be able to play the role of wizard. This is not a game you can afford to lose. You can learn how to repair your wand (as explained further in Magic Rules ) by performing a spell. In practice, however, this should not be necessary.\nYou can build things, but they must all be magical items or you will never use the building. You can build many kinds of buildings that you use to perform certain kinds of magical tricks. For example, you might build a library of magic books or a hall of enchanted mirrors.\nThe rules for the Magic games of the game are described in the Rules. This is only available to the public after you've been chosen as the wizard for the city you've chosen. You can play these games in person or by means of a computer. The rules for each game are listed in the Magic Rules for the specific game. When you begin playing in the city that you've chosen, you have the choice of doing so by playing in person with other people who live in that city, or by using the World of RuneQuest program. The rules for playing in person are described in the rules for Magic, but the rules for playing the games by using the program are explained here. To play, open the program and click on New game, then choose one of the Magic games or the Wizarding World of EverQuest option. Enter the name of the city. Then, click Select wizard. Choose your name from a list.\nIf you do not have your wand working right, use some spells to get it working again as directed in the rules. Otherwise, you won't be able to use the wand and only the elves will be able to do any magics in the city because the elves can see you.\nThere are magical items that you can bring into the city of your choice.

{"prompt":"SatChat : Who are your favorite characters you 've written and why ?","text":"SatChat : Who are your favorite characters you've written and why? What made you fall in love with your favorites?\nThe SSP: Well, I don't know if I have a favorite. If I had to choose one, I might go with Nami. She has made a wonderful friend to Robin, a wonderful partner to Luffy, and a wonderful woman by choice. Her determination and bravery are inspiring.\nWhat makes a character great is the fact that you can relate with them. I always enjoy writing and it is my passion. You just do need a lot of patience and time.\nYou are a Japanese writer, so, how is the Japanese market compared to the other Asian countries regarding to manga?\nThe SSP: All my life I was told that I wasn't good enough and I was told that writing is not a profession. As a child, I did enjoy reading, but I was too shy to ask any one for a book and so I grew up and watched television series being the 'only' form of entertainment available.\nOne time, I went to the library with my younger brother and I watched as a librarian gave books to kids who were asking for them. I was truly amazed by what I saw and I was convinced that writing and being a writer were a possible choice for me. But then, as I grew up, everything around me changed and I saw my parents struggling with the fact that they had given up all of their dreams for my education. I became more and more afraid of showing my interests and my talents. So at the age of 23, when I was finally able to earn enough money to buy some books, I decided to change all of that, despite being very afraid of it. I finally had all the support that I needed in order to follow my passion as I wanted and I realized that writing was the best choice because it is my passion and it is something I would like to have done all my life. Today, I can proudly say that my book is translated into 9 different languages with several different printings.\nThe SSP: This is something I definitely want to continue because I like the idea of getting to know people who read my books as well and learn about the stories they share. I want to share with readers about the places that I have traveled, about the people I have met, about the lessons I have learned along the way. I also want to share with readers about the people who have become important to me and my story and I hope that the message I want to send will resonate with them. I hope that the stories that I write will touch people's hearts and be the start for new adventures.\nThe SSP: My current goal is to continue to do well with my translations of Japanese to English, Japanese to French, French to Japanese and Japanese to Mandarin.\nBesides that, I would like to start writing more stories for other publishers and I also want to continue to work closely with my illustrator.\nThe SSP: I think my most impressive achievement is that I am still working on this passion that I have lived for all of my life and that I can share with people around me. It is something that I hope to never let go of.\nI think it is important to remember everyone is different and we must embrace the individuality that makes us who we are.\nBut I also want to be more consistent with my self-talk and I want to be more aware of what I say to myself so that I can improve my habits and skills.\nI always remind myself that everything happens for a reason.

A couple months later that dead relative calls him. He's troubled. No one remembers the relative dying. He has to figure out why he remembers a timeline that didn't seem to have happened. He questions his sanity. As a psychotherapist I know many people who have had similar symptoms. But these events really happen. Some people have been abused as children and as adults get therapy and learn to let go of their pain. So they may have a flashback of an abusive experience that happened a very long time ago. In many ways this flashback helps with healing from abusiveness. It helps take away some of the pain. Or for some, the flashback helps them remember something that happened that may have been traumatic. But these situations are really common. Also it depends on your relationship with your father. Some people can accept their situation and others can't even begin to imagine having a dad like that. People are wired to have a father or mother figure. Many people are in relationships with a partner they don't feel a deep sense of connection to. They don't feel a deep sense of connection to that relationship. But that doesn't mean that they didn't have good relationships with their parents. Sometimes it can be helpful to talk about past relationship in an empathetic way that doesn 't cause further harm and pain. I have a few clients that are in relationships with a \" very \" abusive partner. And they say that their past is their best friend. They find ways to cope with the pain and they manage to build a good life. But there are some people who can manage to have a great loving relationship with their father.\nBut these days people are looking for a certain degree of closure or an understanding of something. Some people are looking for closure. The psychotherotherapist or other professional who is working with them needs to understand that they may not have the answers and they need to be gentle enough to talk about it. Sometimes this can be about feeling angry or hurt. If you are hurt, there is a way to process that. But there is no way you can be expected to heal from an experience that you do not completely understand or fully understand what led to the experience. In some cases psychotherapists need to have a very hard time explaining to the client some details or some parts of the experience. The client can look at you disgusted as they go to a restaurant and someone starts telling them their own little version of an amazing place. Sometimes they end up with a nice story and they think they can put it on the map for others. It can be very confusing or frustrating for a therapist. Some people want to know why these things happen. They want to heal and they want to understand what is going on.\nI think that part of the issue is a little bit of the psychology of denial. Many people don't want to accept that their experience needs to be understood or that there is a reason for this experience. So they will put on a face, they do not want to face the truth. The truth is if you are a loving person, there is no reason for you to be hurt by this person and if you are a loving person, there is a reason you feel this way towards your father. There is a reason you do not feel a deep sense of connection to this person and sometimes when you see this in a young child, you see there is some kind of attachment disorder. It's not that they are afraid of you but they do not want to show their vulnerability. The same is true of adult trauma. They do not want to show what happened because they are still fearful.

{"prompt":"Death and Life find out that they 're expecting .","text":"Death and Life find out that they're expecting.' It's a cute way to begin a chapter, and at least makes sure that there's no ambiguity (in the minds of the audience, they have at least now been told that death doesn't exist).\nIt also plays to the clich\u00e9dness of the story. Every time I have wanted to die, or felt like I was being stalked, or thought of my own death, I have always felt relieved and happy that I'd at least survived the previous chapter. They get to the point where even when I have been on the brink of my own demise, I am happy that I didn't die during the previous chapter.\nWhy isn't it the reverse? Why don't the survivors have the best days of their lives for a few chapters, then then start feeling insecure about death again in the next five chapters?\nIt has to do with the type of world and setting we're living in. As long as no living thing dies (in the story I'm reading), the life of the survivors must only get better, right? That's how you get good movies like Pride & Prejudice (that is, without deaths in it). Now, if you don't want characters to die, then you need to get really creative with world-building. The story could start out as an all-girl college where no two deaths happen in a chapter. But that's just me.\nThere certainly are cases where a series ends after just a day or two of new life and no deaths have been reported. The Walking Dead, and probably most stories that follow zombies, are no exception.\nDeath and Life is a very unique novel because in no other story have I ever seen anyone write about a group of people living outside of an apocalyptic world, and then have the protagonists begin to fear death. It's one of the reasons I like this story so much.\nI know I can't compare it to the zombie book series (but I love it anyways), but it's fun to read for an hour and a half. I think it's a little different from all the others, but I think that's just how many books are around, so you have to keep up with things. Death and Life won't be forgotten, it was written with an unusual concept, but you also need to have a good storyline for the book to stand out in a crowd. It's all a matter of perspective (for you, and for me), but Death and Life is a great read.\nAs always, thanks for your time. Let me know what you thought of this post in the comments below. Don't forget to check out the other books I've reviewed, because I've already posted about them. I also wrote about my favorite books and my favorite series. There are plenty of books that I have not reviewed on my blog, so take a look and be sure to check it out.\nFor a long time, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to write. I have a number of stories I have in my head, but I didn't know if I should commit to them or not. Now that I have decided to keep writing, I have a lot in the works. I am looking forward to sharing all of my thoughts, ideas, and projects with you all in the future. This story is the second I've started to write, and that is the second I've decided to continue working on, and I'm excited to see where I'm going with it.\nThis story was supposed to be a short story, but I have decided to keep going. It is a story that I plan on having a lot of humor, and a great premise. It's just a start though, but I'm going to keep reading and trying to improve it (which includes me not writing in the same way I have in the past).","token_len":787,"entropy":[3.9631,4.1094,10.4129,4.3249,2.2635,2.7962,1.7287,8.5804,10.7501,3.8413,0.6785,1.7808,7.2664,2.8953,0.4992,5.5383,1.3971,4.2913,2.0148,1.8377,5.578,2.4372,7.7938,4.8584,1.537,3.2169,0.3796,2.8751,5.0546,6.1761,4.1824,1.5931,6.8144,0.0154,0.9144,2.9614,1.8995,4.8154,4.2243,5.6712,0.0595,7.2621,3.2888,2.1744,0.9749,6.0534,4.3129,0.0003,2.0788,1.0046,1.2166,7.9165,2.8745,5.6297,2.3119,0.7033,7.6831,2.7429,5.3843,0.2058,1.1811,2.648,1.6531,5.5893,1.7628,2.7481,5.3182,7.1117,0.2125,5.4959,0.5656,4.6937,4.61,1.9179,0.6334,0.9753,3.6092,7.2254,0.0,1.2728,1.5314,4.7566,2.8859,4.1998,2.2254,1.1382,0.6257,1.0257,2.3968,3.4715,2.3332,6.8642,2.5852,3.2454,2.5356,0.6762,3.8899,5.5303,0.3665,4.3724,3.149,6.2099,1.9775,0.4487,5.8126,5.0097,1.8582,1.6819,0.6363,0.4331,4.372,2.5016,1.4549,3.6041,2.9646,4.8149,1.1624,2.1993,0.1322,3.9991,1.3673,2.6508,0.2767,0.8266,3.0445,3.6376,1.3182,0.5996,3.3817,0.0003,1.3507,6.2147,0.6318,2.4968,0.3742,0.7012,1.8141,6.0768,4.7541,0.0002,1.7801,3.8798,7.1463,0.4328,3.0817,3.5313,0.0003,2.2352,5.5455,2.7453,2.2558,5.7553,6.4736,1.084,0.1002,0.0442,5.811,2.65,3.6443,2.9976,1.7987,3.415,5.4229,4.0404,5.144,6.6563,1.1954,6.0384,2.4772,4.1033,0.6648,0.8567,7.8653,0.8033,0.2669,1.396,2.5336,4.6229,0.9206,0.7061,0.0234,0.821,7.8023,0.0083,4.4848,3.9049,3.1524,3.1827,1.2038,2.1781,0.0651,0.5336,4.0793,3.8369,0.0259,6.5799,7.0495,1.6738,2.851,4.2005,4.0471,1.5365,3.7994,4.9757,1.7269,5.022,1.8656,2.0668,6.5113,1.1347,0.8037,2.595,4.3464,6.8651,4.5975,1.1442,2.2851,4.6616,0.0641,3.723,0.571,3.1522,3.7761,2.2356,4.613,6.697,3.7926,7.5209,4.2346,0.002,0.0002,0.0002,3.4345,5.1182,2.9987,0.3769,4.7055,7.7392,3.7297,1.2573,2.0987,6.3261,1.0815,2.5281,1.4753,3.4914,0.0004,2.3937,6.6657,1.1421,0.7358,0.9799,1.8159,1.4229,2.8024,0.5526,2.964,5.5547,4.854,1.206,6.0208,2.5198,0.0512,0.8201,2.8936,3.2898,4.937,4.2402,1.2334,1.6787,3.0572,4.626,0.1814,5.5432,5.7477,2.8777,4.2314,4.7214,6.6632,3.3879,2.7384,2.0367,5.4106,1.1189,1.9857,2.7377,1.0645,2.815,3.7288,1.1365,1.7719,3.5745,8.4452,1.8811,5.9011,0.342,2.8541,4.9378,3.1521,4.2238,4.2134,1.5649,6.4877,0.7621,0.3017,1.4115,8.1332,2.1474,3.0957,2.9439,2.6537,3.2913,1.9849,1.8735,0.5958,2.7996,7.0832,0.0005,3.3887,4.7073,5.3058,3.05,4.4409,3.1475,2.3107,6.7926,0.5827,2.4827,5.2857,0.4221,0.3831,2.2283,6.3665,1.7675,0.2312,1.8798,1.4661,3.0964,4.0338,5.4249,4.3742,4.8081,5.7091,1.2142,2.5825,3.5089,1.4738,2.3473,2.3013,3.7518,4.387,2.3865,2.0966,4.8875,0.145,1.3897,3.4068,6.0132,0.7037,4.1773,4.1043,1.5942,2.3559,1.5968,3.8172,3.5466,2.4148,4.4416,5.7314,0.5677,5.8042,1.3708,1.1676,2.4227,0.5505,4.0663,0.2924,1.0377,2.7935,1.2951,2.6478,3.0788,2.4122,0.454,0.0288,0.6099,1.3233,2.1471,3.9419,2.0906,3.6672,1.0414,6.3464,1.0701,0.0994,1.9572,4.3694,4.5974,2.2732,3.6902,4.5561,1.1721,4.0661,1.5533,6.8686,1.4073,0.4522,1.6425,0.6638,4.9816,0.8523,0.9788,4.7711,4.7416,2.3951,1.4762,1.1431,0.034,1.0553,2.0577,3.0325,1.2045,0.595,1.7735,3.3909,3.5954,0.8054,4.5982,0.4929,3.2557,1.3556,0.8789,1.5045,1.6826,2.7696,1.5468,3.4289,2.0751,5.7212,3.4048,3.3696,6.8207,2.8145,2.4252,3.9123,2.9234,0.1328,3.7194,2.4394,0.6657,5.2011,0.4981,6.5648,0.1987,0.0039,6.1396,0.0388,1.3389,5.6555,1.2256,2.2871,5.9733,2.308,3.3003,3.7036,5.3198,8.1009,2.4081,2.283,4.5067,2.6145,3.2494,0.1856,3.196,1.2005,2.6469,5.7542,3.2657,1.627,3.8875,1.1469,3.9616,0.9721,3.0787,2.3959,2.1977,0.5391,2.6905,0.6321,4.3604,3.7702,1.5531,0.0007,6.6477,4.8881,4.5363,5.6724,1.6736,3.5839,0.904,0.7947,2.0058,2.1252,5.5135,0.1004,0.0034,0.9311,1.5105,2.5377,1.5544,0.8686,0.7093,4.737,1.9431,0.0563,2.1656,0.3526,4.8225,0.9295,1.4575,5.1,0.5584,0.0157,0.7116,0.0713,2.7799,0.6886,1.3034,3.1225,1.8215,0.0269,0.0563,1.3605,0.813,6.4863,0.0009,0.1152,0.1117,1.5312,0.0653,1.6352,2.0828,2.348,1.4748,0.9399,3.9417,2.3111,4.5506,1.1172,2.2181,2.8187,3.6133,3.8843,0.9482,1.2708,2.5152,2.8564,3.0,1.4359,3.2093,1.6436,2.6929,2.9979,4.0467,0.5701,4.1374,1.6579,5.1584,0.9606,3.3264,0.6046,2.7357,1.6713,0.8709,3.4616,3.3016,2.2766,4.7312,2.6028,1.6017,0.8592,0.6798,4.6456,1.2117,0.4876,2.3569,4.3246,0.2022,0.0131,0.9013,2.2713,0.018,0.8652,1.0453,4.2902,2.8838,4.6106,0.0883,0.6977,0.4688,2.2496,4.0324,0.0781,1.9643,0.0329,1.1658,2.1989,1.3114,0.1984,0.7497,2.4344,0.9423,4.7357,1.5638,4.9447,0.0067,3.8521,1.6886,3.0167,5.3079,0.8622,1.5386,1.1639,1.2231,1.1063,3.1785,0.0005,2.0596,2.2991,0.3906,2.8807,7.5213,0.2424,2.5926,1.9085,0.4113,0.2398,4.2364,1.5179,0.1221,1.2819,4.2909,1.4668,3.9485,2.0741,0.5809,0.3289,2.216,1.4978,1.6779,4.939,2.4423,0.4467,1.0677,1.2482,2.5741,3.3316,0.3896,0.0045,3.7592,4.1345,0.7272,1.2549,1.5289,2.2097,2.0868,0.3201,0.3573,5.1239,0.5162,0.2932,1.5166,2.7812,0.1294,1.0946,0.3443,5.033,4.6631,1.009,3.6826,4.5005,5.2197,1.3732,3.7431,2.1969,0.5087,2.3647,0.7169,4.4831,1.996,2.6839,3.607,1.6339,1.0423,3.9285,0.3452,4.0202,3.9303,0.1188,5.2729,1.7228,1.3433,2.1488,2.1592,0.5614,1.8656,2.8762,1.8581,3.7831,1.4719,1.1954,0.8088,0.1854,0.9904,3.5127,1.4728,2.2737,7.088

After seven years, the final segment of the 10.5-mile rail line connecting Port Chester and Yonkers and stretching south along the Hudson River through Cedar Fair and Eastchester\u2014including the previously announced new track from Route 9 to the Cedar Fair train station\u2014will officially open to the public on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 27, 2011.\nThe 2.1-mile section from the Yonkers Train Center to the Cedar Fair track opening is expected to open sometime in late 2011.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation completed construction work on the South Shore Rail Link last November, completing the first segment of the line between Port Chester and Yonkers, and will officially open the Yonkers-Cedar Fair rail line tomorrow.\nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the Rail Link opens the Hudson Valley to the rest of the country and to the rest of the world, connecting New York to the rest of the Northeast and other places around the world. The South Shore Rail Link is also a critical link connecting commuters and customers between Northeastern New York, New Jersey and the rest of the United States.\nWith a total mileage of 10.5 miles, the Rail Link connects major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Long Island; as well as, Port Chester and Yonkers. This link provides new and improved access to the Cedar Fair theme park and the Eastchester Shopping Center, as well as numerous residential communities between the two cities. The Rail Link provides access via the Cedar Fair station for people traveling to their jobs around the area; as well as, connecting those same people to the local shopping districts of Yonkers and Port Chester, where access to public transportation has not been previously possible.\nThe new train station at the Cedar Fair theme park provides an excellent location to serve the park and businesses along Route 9, making the Rail Link a critical part of that route. Access is also made possible from the Westchester County Line in Yonkers. The Rail Link extends east to the New Fairfield Station, which provides convenient access to both Port Chester and Yonkers. Connecting the two cities in this way, it will reduce time to commute, reduce parking needs, and improve travel options from the east during the peak commuter periods.","token_len":788,"entropy":[2.5476,5.5301,0.0327,2.8281,0.2624,7.9691,3.2272,5.9999,1.6096,2.6811,0.0485,9.3241,1.9247,0.6466,4.7893,1.6183,10.2756,5.5188,1.9841,3.4974,1.7686,5.4668,1.6707,4.6733,2.8156,6.398,5.8273,0.4626,4.1322,6.394,1.6776,5.7856,0.3697,0.1258,0.7631,1.2633,2.1878,5.8745,1.3693,6.2442,0.0246,5.7434,2.086,5.9497,7.0253,1.637,1.1854,1.9725,1.8587,1.1878,4.6372,1.0564,0.7514,3.8726,0.4152,1.8217,2.9089,2.4737,0.2417,11.3511,0.528,7.0287,3.9973,1.429,1.2465,4.7218,1.9527,2.3396,1.9156,4.1149,2.1114,1.1467,3.074,0.5551,0.8825,1.2553,1.4115,1.7467,1.1891,0.215,0.3781,0.2113,5.2372,4.3149,1.3156,2.2153,3.5385,3.4252,12.15,0.7162,3.197,0.4819,5.8148,20.0437,9.052,3.7744,4.5826,3.4492,4.1757,1.1803,3.9372,3.7748,7.1581,2.2859,7.2597,3.7384,3.0045,1.4115,1.5067,1.7835,0.087,0.599,0.0338,0.0832,0.232,2.2527,4.6106,1.2645,5.6025,0.8687,1.0983,1.3463,5.8519,3.2281,0.6033,3.569,5.9945,0.347,8.4103,0.0216,0.3205,1.4811,3.655,5.3003,3.5926,1.0789,1.076,4.0277,1.4454,1.111,2.6197,3.8658,0.5027,0.8532,7.3071,1.6008,1.0757,2.8989,4.1475,6.6248,0.411,5.6427,2.3624,4.6677,1.1343,3.123,2.4661,5.316,5.7427,0.2046,0.222,0.9745,4.0221,1.242,2.8919,1.237,3.5326,0.6361,0.667,0.7559,3.4923,0.2908,3.6237,2.1566,3.3731,0.802,0.1645,0.03,10.1751,0.5722,0.8456,0.4919,2.8557,0.8837,0.0547,0.0324,5.5061,1.0074,2.2262,5.6343,1.02,0.3994,1.5702,3.8694,1.7704,1.381,0.2787,5.3673,2.1211,1.3823,4.4658,6.1181,3.3174,5.0837,5.8552,1.4773,1.7628,6.9424,5.8856,2.665,0.7772,5.8216,3.0971,4.253,3.2481,7.0217,3.5164,5.8273,1.0569,5.6653,2.8973,5.1556,3.9086,0.0429,10.5385,5.8073,8.167,0.0052,1.3944,3.8198,6.8009,3.3948,7.2818,0.8541,0.1007,0.6448,2.3366,5.2751,1.5408,1.0858,2.0458,4.8354,6.3361,0.003,6.5292,0.9304,4.4516,0.1366,0.3758,5.6277,4.2008,2.7257,2.7814,3.6537,1.2589,4.9842,3.0235,5.0201,0.0142,0.6147,7.1283,1.8825,1.4035,3.0629,1.557,3.4402,2.6174,2.168,1.2831,2.3358,4.5383,3.5051,1.4852,0.0042,2.7644,1.7978,6.9382,1.1346,5.0224,3.5217,2.368,1.668,5.6354,3.2582,8.2469,3.0068,4.0217,3.1312,3.4154,6.5382,0.1882,2.3989,1.2527,3.5744,5.041,1.6336,3.3466,2.3376,2.9696,5.6191,2.0693,0.7945,1.5379,0.0027,1.4592,2.0986,3.8604,2.8228,0.2243,0.3215,1.7727,0.6305,2.8908,8.196,1.8467,0.1293,0.0728,2.8482,0.0022,5.8674,8.0635,1.3331,2.4317,4.3919,0.0198,5.7124,0.4935,4.5165,4.8374,6.5848,0.2049,0.8217,6.14,4.8498,3.4527,2.7642,1.6151,6.2873,5.9635,0.2816,2.2802,0.8437,5.2544,4.6714,0.9598,0.1351,6.52,3.494,1.7639,0.5806,0.0773,3.058,0.6195,5.9109,5.3809,5.3376,0.9302,5.5486,0.0095,3.9259,5.6969,4.3012,3.4596,0.7629,2.859,0.2432,4.2604,8.9726,8.464,2.3165,4.5774,6.3199,7.0259,3.7154,1.1553,8.4254,2.8161,4.4442,5.095,4.3989,6.5161,3.944,1.2682,1.809,8.2699,0.9975,5.2606,0.39,0.6373,0.5692,4.5644,0.4536,4.5523,0.4184,0.0073,1.1887,7.4571,0.7168,2.0749,4.8265,0.0182,3.8774,1.0497,4.1413,0.1244,0.9941,1.4898,6.6462,0.7882,2.812,0.3426,0.0778,2.8068,4.2028,1.5633,6.0468,0.0095,5.6371,3.6915,0.5676,0.6115,3.0433,0.019,6.0797,7.4624,2.3005,1.948,0.0045,1.6242,4.6132,0.7914,3.2083,2.0485,0.6338,1.3083,1.3719,3.8936,0.0027,0.0027,0.0021,0.3257,0.0016,0.0424,5.863,1.3353,4.3781,0.5679,0.5004,2.2402,0.0177,0.1302,0.0314,4.4383,3.2215,1.4554,4.5605,1.1211,1.7044,3.5153,0.2413,0.1975,2.569,2.6592,1.9998,0.0185,0.1029,1.0097,0.0017,2.0207,1.8962,3.2412,4.4014,0.1285,4.5221,8.4402,0.0129,2.5196,3.0019,0.0072,0.0214,3.1956,1.8993,7.265,1.613,0.7712,5.7317,0.1828,2.0031,1.4413,0.0038,0.0102,0.0036,1.6628,2.082,7.6936,0.1362,4.3583,1.5317,7.2719,2.595,0.9762,1.2799,3.8211,0.0023,0.2902,2.0855,2.2258,4.0449,1.11,3.1634,0.006,0.3326,0.3408,1.9017,5.8029,2.9587,0.1216,3.1166,1.6426,2.3224,0.0019,0.197,4.3916,1.6961,6.2507,3.7355,3.1779,0.0543,0.5684,0.2971,2.0777,4.0319,0.0279,0.3841,0.0117,1.8934,3.6441,2.6247,3.1485,2.0228,2.9259,8.896,2.0242,6.0885,3.9597,8.1246,0.0067,1.6233,0.1461,2.0795,2.5386,0.2277,0.6713,1.5232,1.6583,0.0008,0.179,1.604,0.0214,0.4142,0.5773,5.2583,2.872,2.9994,9.1858,0.127,4.4271,0.2532,0.3622,0.3206,0.5151,0.3461,3.6465,0.0018,2.7168,5.9834,2.4951,0.1203,3.346,0.0027,1.4263,0.0882,0.6971,1.6085,2.4337,0.0062,5.3913,4.223,0.0501,0.0043,6.1893,6.4137,0.0332,1.0654,0.7953,0.005,1.0824,4.2081,3.759,3.3748,4.597,2.066,1.9971,1.8694,0.2898,1.3322,8.722,0.0322,11.1239,0.1649,1.4573,1.6865,4.3647,2.1992,5.1615,0.136,1.1254,1.7331,0.0024,0.0036,5.7733,5.718,4.3023,6.5808,1.555,1.9406,1.5494,0.2261,1.8982,2.4072,0.0021,4.0285,2.2215,5.9713,1.3463,3.195,0.0714,2.8906,4.0541,4.1873,2.0019,2.2143,5.7118,4.0021,5.3974,0.4099,4.5472,3.8989,2.1381,0.0285,0.0576,1.0108,3.0465,5.3974,6.6771,2.6095,0.4666,1.2521,4.8615,3.1976,4.9521,3.9602,2.7165,0.009,0.5205,2.3193,0.0012,2.3511,2.5677,6.5055,0.4772,5.8095,0.5735,4.3031,4.2974,0.3486,3.904,1.6759,0.1617,0.4712,1.4314,3.367,4.0654,1.9728,1.9919,1.0669,1.8318,0.009,7.2002,0.0111,4.3947,2.8382,2.6049,2.907,1.8271,5.6628,1.7686,6.7178,2.2001,6.318,3.3552,3.0067,0.1398,1.6194,4.505,1.8404,2.7506,0.0025,0.9437,2.5781,2.3949,0.0034,3.9683,3.6913,0.6648,6.3468,3.0909,1.2201,3.8166,2.4946,3.3821,0

{"prompt":"At the age of 21 , everyone receives a weapon that embodies them perfectly .","text":"At the age of 21, everyone receives a weapon that embodies them perfectly. The weapons can be customised depending on their personality, interests, strengths, weaknesses and abilities that will be needed to complete the missions. The player can choose up to three weapons and three specialties.\nWith every weapon are four specializations which let you customize them. Each weapon specialization will have an active effect on how the weapon behaves in battle. There is no set order of which specializations you can choose so feel free to try them out.\nFor your own weapons you can level up their stats by acquiring points. A point costs 10 Gold coins. Leveling up a weapon will give you better stats and also additional customisations. This gives you plenty of points to spend on your weapons and you can always invest gold into them.\nEach weapon with its corresponding specialization has multiple customizations to make it as unique as possible. These include weapons\u2019 design, ammunition and more. You can also upgrade your weapons and specialization skills using Gold and Premium Gems. With Gold coins you can purchase weapons, upgrade skills and increase the maximum level of weapons and skills. Premium Gems will be required to upgrade weapons and specializations with skills.\nThis year\u2019s The Game Awards has a different feel than previous editions, with fewer big-name awards being handed out and a different format overall. But the awards were nonetheless interesting, and the biggest win was for Cyberpunk 2077, which won Best Platformer and the big award for game of the year.\nWe\u2019ve got some reactions to the event here. The biggest highlight was the announcement of a special PS5 edition of the Ratchet & Clank series, and how it wasn\u2019t just a rebrand, but a complete reworking of the franchise. That\u2019s because in the statement, Insomniac Games mentioned that the PS5 version of Ratchet & Clank is not a simple port. It will be a new game created from the ground-up which will, potentially, expand the main cast from the original trilogy to three or four people.\nFor the majority of us, it\u2019s all downhill from here now, but we look forward to seeing it for ourselves in the future.\nSophia is the Director of the Health Centre and the manager of the health centre. She is also the co-owner and manager of a dental surgery that has been with her husband for 22 years. Her husband is a doctor and she also has two children.\nThe centre is a very busy health centre with over 1,000 patients a week, with each person attending in several different areas. The clinic is a walk-in clinic where there are also an additional 12 doctors from both our practice and the community who work on a fee-for-service basis.\nSophia works with our reception staff, who have over 20 years combined experience in the health centre, to manage our reception area. She also works closely with our medical doctors to co-ordinate and ensure continuity of treatment. Sophia's main job is to work with patients and their families to improve their experience and ensure they are seen as quickly as possible. Her job also involves managing patients and coordinating when they should be seen.\nThis is how she lives her role, she treats the patients with care, respect and understanding. She has many positive relationships with her patients and knows what they need to ease their experience.\nSophia's role also includes leading on the NHS Choices programme and ensuring the service we provide is clear and easy to access.

{"prompt":"A cloned wooly mammoth theme park evolves into a restaurant chain due to lack of interest in live mammoths .","text":"A cloned wooly mammoth theme park evolves into a restaurant chain due to lack of interest in live mammoths. The project was developed by local developers to create an environmental, economic, and cultural asset for the community. The park was created to be a place not just for visitors but also visitors to live. The park had live mammoths, but those animals were euthanized after the park opened in 2014 due to the low attendance. As a result, the park experienced a financial decline (Kumar, 2015a) and is now at the point of abandonment. The initial idea of the zoo has now evolved into a restaurant chain, which has taken over the life story of the wild mammoth project and moved on.\nWhen visitors to the theme park are offered the chance to live a life of their dreams, they do so by feeding or sleeping with these wild animals. However, they cannot do this without first being invited to the park. This invitation takes the form of a gift bag that they pick up at the entrance gate -the gift packs contain all kinds of amenities that support them during their stay.\nIn this project a new model of living emerged that can be considered a collective form of appropriation and reconstitution of a project where the main goal is the sustainability of cultural assets and the economic benefits of the project. In this case, the economic return from a theme park, a building with rooms that host guests, and private apartments that are rented out is small compared to the high costs of building and maintaining these ecosystems, especially for groups that can only afford to pay a small fee to visit a theme park.\nThe project also represents an unusual example of collective ownership, where people share ownership of land and resources, but also share responsibility for decisions about how they are used and maintained. The main goal of this project is not to attract new visitors, but to retain what had been there. In this case the key question remains untreated: Who owns the wildlife and how does it belong to the community?\nIn order to maintain the environmental conditions that made this project attractive to visitors, the management has decided to sell the wildlife as a gift, creating a new business model that gives them more control over their existence in the future, while also offering them financial compensation for their purchase. Although the project has come to an end, the wildlife is going to be preserved and made part of the future.\nConclusion\nAs the case study illustrated, new ecosystems that incorporate wild heritage are able to challenge the power relationship between the individual and the natural heritage. These new eco-social projects are located in remote areas and provide new opportunities to people in regions dominated by high value assets or natural hazards, or to small-scale private investors and land owners around the world. In so doing, they are able to develop new forms of knowledge and a better and more sustainable use of wild heritage. These are, in many ways, 'land-grant'-type ecosystems. A land-grant provides an economic guarantee to long-term use of land and resources, while maintaining their integrity and allowing for the sustainability of resources over time. Land grants have been around in developed countries for centuries and have been developed on the basis of a contract between a land owner and the government.\nSince their introduction there is increasing interest in creating new ecosystems that are based on land grants, and research and experience shows that both private and public interest is growing.\nIn this paper, we explored the use of land grants in the area of cultural heritage and its implications for how land can be managed as ecosystems. However, as the discussion also reveals, the use of land grants in other ecological projects needs to be studied further. In particular, future work includes taking a more historical approach to understand how land grants have been used so far. It also needs to expand the concept of land grants to other cases of cultural heritage projects, for example to heritage in the built environment.","token_len":789,"entropy":[9.5233,3.5192,12.0363,1.1332,0.9406,11.4726,1.5108,11.3775,0.6201,0.7534,8.4237,4.127,8.0447,0.0121,5.025,0.0038,4.5664,1.2064,7.5125,12.622,0.1318,1.2369,2.5807,6.2143,2.1809,4.7174,0.7992,4.8182,4.7364,4.4229,2.7174,1.9821,6.1341,4.2,2.3308,1.3834,0.5077,1.9153,4.1949,1.8563,0.7071,4.1985,0.6627,1.9628,1.949,2.344,3.6078,2.3929,2.4898,0.9005,2.3657,6.2158,2.0469,0.1723,2.29,0.8772,1.0378,4.9653,1.3991,4.946,3.1418,1.7887,1.6483,4.9999,7.9771,1.1795,0.0024,2.0885,2.665,6.0796,2.777,0.915,5.8538,0.0025,0.0497,3.0451,2.3254,1.089,3.8778,1.4128,3.7655,4.173,0.0043,2.2569,4.5934,5.2105,1.25,4.6363,1.2131,0.1066,0.5554,0.7742,0.5101,4.6051,1.0514,5.0032,3.5781,6.0087,6.8171,5.0951,2.043,2.549,4.0858,2.2798,1.0795,4.0725,0.6029,4.6872,2.047,2.4275,0.6599,6.7563,0.7395,1.8107,6.6357,4.6218,1.5958,1.2182,4.9864,5.2645,3.8339,2.3171,0.2161,0.5016,2.8508,0.4791,2.429,2.2942,2.027,4.7068,1.573,0.6998,7.0431,7.052,0.3135,0.2894,7.2349,2.517,5.2039,2.3401,5.4099,3.1483,2.4519,1.1152,10.0516,4.9737,3.7189,0.5243,6.4296,0.0772,2.6001,5.4494,2.2045,0.7062,0.0363,3.4615,3.5577,2.1641,1.1288,2.951,2.9116,0.4641,1.0833,4.4376,1.5261,1.498,6.0245,4.4541,4.1111,2.3754,4.5255,3.2809,1.6957,0.4309,4.0322,0.0572,3.1955,3.8067,2.8846,0.9911,2.1905,4.5188,3.1416,6.1847,0.4001,2.1569,2.5816,1.3266,2.4425,5.8609,5.1738,1.9584,1.4431,0.0079,0.9298,5.1507,6.6981,3.0262,2.7057,5.4352,0.2486,2.2004,0.3787,1.7361,5.6034,7.9376,7.5278,2.6762,8.72,3.3052,3.4117,4.0294,0.0023,7.0677,2.39,6.9738,3.7522,3.3191,0.3781,1.9713,1.0785,2.5387,3.0211,2.8319,5.0701,5.1085,3.8993,5.4576,0.7077,2.7639,9.1119,2.8338,3.7695,0.7819,3.3858,2.0005,7.8854,5.3848,0.0905,10.2612,2.7907,8.172,2.4327,0.0911,1.1854,2.286,4.8586,5.2249,1.2908,5.5411,2.5707,0.3388,3.1298,5.7344,0.3343,7.8818,1.3958,2.1278,1.5771,5.9263,3.0915,0.8669,1.6561,1.1842,0.3243,2.8125,1.0309,2.1851,0.4901,0.6535,7.0699,6.4088,2.8272,3.6234,5.1473,0.0132,4.2506,3.9349,6.0247,3.3181,8.0364,2.7457,4.8212,3.2206,0.807,1.105,6.9101,4.6733,2.0338,2.2902,5.3098,1.5612,3.8471,7.8426,1.3115,0.1012,0.5667,5.7285,2.7928,0.6438,3.6675,2.776,1.0898,3.4079,6.9149,3.6076,3.425,2.1474,7.3611,1.8208,3.9461,2.1606,0.783,0.5935,2.1051,2.0819,1.963,1.8417,1.8635,3.8186,1.618,0.9189,0.0052,0.3922,0.9175,1.6714,3.8158,3.0896,4.8221,2.0251,6.8097,4.4902,0.1348,5.4921,3.924,2.8133,2.5123,3.9654,4.1372,2.4416,0.7109,3.8457,1.2312,2.1694,2.1855,2.1358,2.6659,2.4368,2.5559,0.3053,6.8917,2.6846,1.7729,2.1178,2.9839,1.4822,1.1526,4.5046,0.3571,1.7212,5.4256,2.0906,0.3004,1.3492,0.272,0.3504,3.3999,0.7617,6.6178,2.8358,0.588,1.1076,0.1699,0.2607,5.2397,4.7089,5.5215,0.4855,4.0621,2.4454,2.8822,1.161,1.0822,2.322,5.2665,3.5566,4.6551,13.1548,1.3556,4.5751,1.5787,0.8951,6.1451,1.7359,1.7487,1.7843,1.02,3.0266,0.2514,0.895,0.7113,0.2756,0.6996,2.8679,2.9705,0.0677,4.4676,1.011,5.6345,5.8472,2.0317,4.9594,1.6681,0.5427,6.84,0.6888,1.3361,0.3119,0.8522,4.9632,3.8872,2.7249,0.2768,5.2041,0.7218,4.4466,3.3624,1.4136,2.6309,2.5363,5.633,0.5087,2.3743,4.238,0.4666,1.8393,5.6545,3.5032,3.4918,2.1004,0.248,1.1189,7.7681,3.9009,0.6428,2.1992,3.3623,2.7857,1.5715,3.9015,1.0807,5.1544,3.6392,1.2619,1.1331,5.3651,1.0333,5.4066,0.9854,3.4028,1.4279,5.3333,0.8681,1.6619,0.0491,0.5637,0.9218,5.7924,1.9326,5.8925,0.3878,1.4638,3.6581,1.4752,5.7649,3.8769,0.0029,0.4366,3.7065,2.2222,0.8932,6.129,0.1963,3.2827,2.0446,6.7463,2.0491,6.632,0.7264,7.0796,4.6988,3.0816,7.1886,2.8738,8.7061,1.4297,5.846,0.0022,6.7507,1.1769,6.334,7.0075,0.7568,1.5185,4.0004,0.2057,0.7112,3.6848,7.8661,1.673,3.8333,2.3641,6.8059,0.1465,4.2598,3.967,1.7163,7.6099,0.65,5.9494,0.8446,1.9324,3.6273,3.4679,0.558,1.795,5.884,3.4668,7.1518,7.7203,0.0048,5.6175,5.3332,5.74,4.3119,4.6339,6.7305,2.3838,3.9741,2.0738,6.2026,3.4578,0.2035,4.6434,3.406,2.9519,5.4898,0.827,7.4052,0.1809,0.1632,0.3596,2.8177,6.1495,0.0804,0.1753,1.2044,2.358,1.8854,0.0067,4.6746,1.8352,2.9904,0.0131,5.6826,0.9258,4.4759,4.1648,7.2021,0.3963,0.7158,3.7656,0.0415,5.6867,4.012,0.8383,3.183,2.873,5.2995,0.6271,3.0796,0.4714,0.0069,7.2899,6.1491,2.5556,4.3365,1.2822,6.177,1.8685,4.0638,1.5441,5.184,3.5843,0.706,0.0877,0.046,6.3088,2.0977,4.16,6.7565,0.9953,8.9884,0.1574,0.3818,4.0763,0.5913,3.3308,1.6058,1.2815,1.1801,1.9381,3.5794,4.2718,4.9552,0.9629,5.4128,1.4906,1.6572,4.9285,0.11,6.4349,5.6245,0.5046,0.2318,3.7043,1.7464,3.2867,1.7363,4.0292,3.6898,5.8748,0.4715,0.4607,1.5769,1.2819,1.5848,1.1693,4.7065,4.4011,1.5943,0.4597,0.0309,2.548,6.0431,1.4103,1.9917,2.1386,2.379,0.0982,1.0867,2.6313,0.8895,2.709,4.7673,4.2527,2.9298,5.1863,3.3854,4.0938,1.1157,0.3504,4.7339,2.0944,2.1186,1.807,2.0606,4.2969,0.1437,4.2976,2.4729,1.238,1.8874,7.0971,2.5722,6.9455,3.2624,0.1204,4.8562,3.8574,0.2191,0.3854,5.7838,2.3877,4.6589,1.1851,3.2831,2.3454,1.8561,3.1608,1.0565,0.6871,6.3528,0.6719,4.4978,0.1225,1.7704,0.3436,1.3319,1.5403,5.3198,0.3745,5.1153,2.2552,1.8685,3.4226,3.2944,0.3062,5.0333,3.3315,3.5423,0.3924,3.0532,4.368,5.7241,0.53,5.7764,0.0212,3.6504,1.9478,5.

{"prompt":"In the end , we must all be what we are .","text":"In the end, we must all be what we are. If you want me to be your friend, I must be your friend. If you want me to live here, you can do it. But if you want me to walk, I must accept it.\nIt could not be denied. If it was you who wanted him, you could walk, but he had asked me, and I also would walk. This is just a relationship between you and me.\n\"Why do you have to do it so? You can call me when you are able to come to my villa, so that I can explain.\"\nThe elder brother said. The younger brother frowned. Elder brother, you are worried that I will get in trouble.\nThe younger brother sneered. If you get in trouble, it will be you who is stuck in trouble. I will not go for it.\n\"If I live here, will you not live here?\" Yu Dongyang asked. He thought about it, and he could not tell him that he is living with the elder brother.\n\"Of course, I am the eldest when he dies. He is a good man, so he only needs to leave a bit of space for himself, not for his relatives. It is not an obligation. If he leaves enough space for himself, it will be even better. \"\nThen Yu Dongyang thought about it. If his relatives are so generous, he might give up the idea of moving into the city.\nThe second brother smiled and said, \"We have a sister-in-law in the city. I went back to the city but got lost, so my brother-in-law brought me back. I had just decided to take a rest, but when I got here, I heard my brother-in-law talking with my father-in-law about sending me back to the city. Then my brother-in-law also said no.\"\nWhen it comes to their family, the second brother is not so generous. The two brothers have always been together, and neither of them was very strong.\n\"My mom is still very young, so I think she might be able to get back in five years. Then I hope to spend my life at the villa next to yours,\" said the second brother.\nThis family thought about it, and they felt that if they gave up all contact with the younger brother, the elder brother would accept it, since his mother-in-law was still young. And if they do not accept, then they will get a younger brother.\nThen, the elder brother and the youngest brother agreed, and they said, \"Then we can talk with him about it, and we will do it together.\"\nYu Dongyang was stunned when he heard the news. He thought about it, and he could not admit himself in the village of the villagers, which is a bit strange.\nHe is too generous to himself. If he does such a thing, then he will lose even one more person. After all, he is not in a hurry.\nYu Dongyang did not get angry but looked thoughtful. He did not want to give up all contact with his two younger brothers. The elder brother is now the eldest.\n\"All right, then we talk again later.\" The younger brother agreed. He thought about it, thinking for a while, and then he said, \"I also have something to tell you.\"\n\"Yes, it is important,\" said the second brother, his voice low. He had no choice but to turn away from his face. He took out a small cell phone, the front side was black, and the back side had seven little circles, and with each circle on there, there was a special symbol, from the small to the big one, there were five. Those five symbols formed a magic

Nobody has ever done that for you before .","text":"You are a super villain and were captured 10 years ago by a dashing superhero. The time is up. As part of your plan for revenge you lie to the superhero saying you're reformed and want to visit to apologize. You go, and he throws you a surprise party. Nobody has ever done that for you before. Your girlfriend left you not too long ago after you revealed what you were. So you decide to leave the party as well. Now it's time for the hero to play the hero. He takes you back to the rescue as he saved your life 10 years ago. After your little talk he returns to the office. Now it's time for the hero to meet with his supervisor, who is going to ask what happened with the superhero. When you go, and reveal what you did, you must do so politely, as the superhero may not like the answer. It will cost you another year of your jail time if you say something rude. The hero decides to talk with the superhero about the situation as he understands that it is the end of the road. The hero is a bit concerned at first as he doesn't know how to go about this since the hero and superhero are friends. As he gets to the subject, the superhero is surprised that the hero wouldn't know because they went to the same school. The superhero gets angry that the hero doesn't listen to his advice and has done some crazy things. The hero is so upset with the situation that he lets it slip that he still had feelings for the superhero and that if they were to be together, they would still be as friends. The superhero is amazed and happy to hear that and wants to spend the rest of his life with the hero as his friend. The hero also has a choice to stay and help others that need help. Since the hero and superhero have only gone out a few times and didn't spend that much time together though, it was hard to make a connection between them. Since you had a few hours with the hero for the super hero to explain everything to you, he would like an opportunity to see you again ( the superhero may still do so on your behalf ) but he doesn't want to ask for that. The superhero thinks that maybe the end of the road came too early, that the hero might miss out on one last chance. He will get an opportunity in two years time. The hero decides to go see the superhero tomorrow afternoon, at 3 AM. You have some information to tell the superhero, but don't tell them that you are back. Then again, he wouldn't believe you and it wouldn't really be appropriate. The hero is in his office and the superhero has just arrived. You come up to him and say hello to him. As the hero looks into the camera at you, you think that the superhero never forgave you for what you did. Instead of walking away right away, you say a few good byes ( don't leave a bad taste even if it is not intended ). He tells you that he hasn't forgotten you and he's happy that you are making a positive change in your life. Then the superhero says he knows that your time is up and the hero will let you know when to come down again. You thank him and head off to your office, realizing that he helped the hero realize where he is wrong and also helped him with the hero.\nThis can be done in several ways : 1. You could stay and talk, then leave at 3 AM. This way is a good way to end the meeting, as it gives everyone a chance to have some time after. 2, You could go say good byes right away. 3. You could tell them that you don't believe the superhero and leave the meeting right away. 4. You could tell other people and leave if they believe the superhero.

In fact, nearly 70 percent said they plan to vote for the president they know rather than an unknown candidate.\nA statewide poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies, a firm that specializes in voting research, asked registered voters in the state about their intentions Tuesday and Wednesday. It asked more than 3,000 registered voters in both swing and non-Swing states, from a pool of registered voters more the size of the state\u2019s population.\nAmong all respondents, 69 percent of Republican voters and 69 percent of Democratic voters said they plan to vote for the party they registered as. However, voters of all partisan labels planned to vote.\nThe poll found that when asked specifically about the election between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, 87 percent of Republican voters and 69 percent of Democrats said they wanted to decide in November.\n\u201cWhen it comes to election, it\u2019s all about who you know,\u201d said Debbie Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan voter registration organization Inland North Alabama Voting.\nIn general terms, statewide voter support for Republicans has exceeded Democratic support since 2016. However, a handful of counties and the state capital, Montgomery, have been swinging closer to the Democratic candidate. In particular, Republicans have been heavily outnumbered in the state capital.\n\u201cWhen you look at the numbers, if you take into account where you live, what part of the country you come from and how long you\u2019ve lived here,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s clear that you can predict who might be elected in any given election.\u201d\nSome counties, according to the poll, have recorded higher Democratic and lower Republican support than others. For example, the percentage of Republicans who say they will vote for the GOP president in November in the northern Alabama counties of Tallapoosa, Pickens, St Mary\u2019s and Jackson had fallen below 50 percent for years prior to the 2020 election. However, according to the poll, those counties have recorded a significant jump in support for the president, with 59 percent of Republican voters in that region voting for Trump, compared with 49 percent across the

{"prompt":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story , Leave A Comment - Space Race Edition !","text":"Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story, Leave A Comment - Space Race Edition! | The Spelling Bee\nIn September 2016, I participated in a writing challenge called, Leave A Story, Leave A Word. Participants had up to 30 minutes to write, based on a prompt, and their entries would then be read aloud in one of nine different categories:\nThis writing challenge got me thinking about an old blog post idea called Free Write. The idea was to spend 30 minutes writing about anything. I\u2019ve done the idea several times over the past few years, and each time I think it was such a productive way to spend an afternoon.\nIn September, I participated in a different writing challenge and the idea of Free Write popped back in my mind. As I began to think about it, it occurred to me that this idea would be just the thing for August \u2013 my first month as an MIAF Mentor.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if it would work, since it\u2019s not a writing challenge based on a prompt, but I thought, what\u2019s impossible?!?\nThis time, I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone would participate, so I made my post public. At the same time, I was thinking about how I could make it work as an experiment, too.\nSo, this past week, when I had some time to spend, I decided to share my thoughts and experiences. It turns out, I don\u2019t regret a thing. This blog post idea resonated with a number of my colleagues.\nWe had a great time and I learned a lot about my new group, the MIAF, and this writing idea. My biggest take away is that, even though we are writers, it\u2019s important to get out and meet people! I have already scheduled time in my schedule for next month to participate in free write, so stay tuned! (For those of you who haven\u2019t participated in the FREE WRITE idea, here is how the process worked: Post an entry and invite others to read it. Write something that\u2019s true, funny, or touching. It doesn\u2019t have to be a whole post, you can just say, \u201cThis is a really important message. It\u2019s true, fun, or touching. Please share it with others through comments or e-mail.\u201d)\nI\u2019m also thinking about posting regular, 30-minute free-write style blog posts throughout the year \u2013 I\u2019m already working on plans for the next year or so! If you would like to participate, leave a comment below and I\u2019ll plan to post about some of the free-writing ideas. If you are interested in taking part, send me an e-mail and I\u2019ll send you the specific link!\nI also have one other writing experiment planned. If you are new to The Spelling Bee, you might have noticed that I used to write a blog post every month. Those posts focused on topics related to writing, editing, publishing, marketing, and more. They didn\u2019t have any specific prompt or theme, they were just regular posts about writing. For nearly seven years, those posts are gone. I wrote one in the last few months, about the benefits of free writing, and now, here we are!\nI\u2019ve already begun planning posts for the next year, but since the blog is more than seven years old I don\u2019t want to do any old posts. I want to do a blog tour or some other post idea that hasn\u2019t been done. There are some blog tour ideas in my drafts, but they haven\u2019t hit the \u201cpublic\u201d button. If it\u2019s okay with you, I plan to put together something new that will include the older posts as a link or teaser.","token_len":793,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,7.1628,5.2325,7.8636,3.0804,3.6472,1.0978,2.4836,4.9926,9.8932,8.222,7.186,4.0602,6.4385,3.8305,8.2968,1.7369,0.7043,2.8022,7.0643,6.1494,3.4378,0.4638,2.5063,5.8212,0.0549,1.1316,5.7049,4.9877,3.4088,3.6325,5.7682,0.2679,0.3852,0.187,0.1441,0.013,11.3404,1.111,6.7081,2.7971,7.0755,0.1121,3.4563,2.6279,0.1519,0.2684,3.1327,7.2374,0.0695,2.2821,8.4999,2.6668,1.8682,4.6606,5.3413,1.8155,3.6604,0.1071,4.2929,1.4072,2.0687,4.7467,0.6525,5.5214,3.5227,3.6339,1.6206,2.636,5.1495,4.9332,0.4525,6.0993,1.2943,0.7754,0.3103,5.4967,3.8154,4.6352,1.0874,7.5514,3.5289,5.4381,0.8579,1.0371,2.8376,0.5136,0.8766,0.9904,8.0575,4.3091,0.176,1.3698,2.0675,5.7717,2.6516,1.9998,17.5044,7.3183,4.1313,4.2578,4.07,4.6639,3.5822,0.0323,3.3399,0.493,1.8904,1.2594,0.2909,0.9832,0.7534,5.3168,0.0626,0.9076,3.9646,1.8489,2.8827,6.7216,0.3384,7.0726,2.4053,0.2505,3.2115,3.1888,1.9676,0.6917,1.7909,3.0526,3.2727,2.0669,0.3423,1.9506,0.0187,0.161,8.4975,0.5578,0.0629,5.9597,3.6573,2.186,3.064,1.7007,0.0485,5.5133,5.5806,3.8528,0.1949,2.3452,0.299,4.6693,1.2297,4.4756,0.9155,1.6117,0.2463,1.8503,0.2298,2.734,4.5938,0.0032,0.009,0.2781,3.0247,2.263,2.5441,0.9648,4.9559,2.4444,2.7533,2.9998,10.4132,5.4513,4.8667,2.1662,2.8385,2.4985,1.8814,11.9603,5.7944,10.6184,0.2134,0.5464,1.2602,1.864,5.013,3.6343,0.7015,0.0395,0.9819,1.2842,2.1917,1.0856,1.7646,1.6332,5.0661,2.114,3.7021,0.1453,0.6145,2.4934,1.9579,4.1441,0.8295,7.1243,0.2443,1.432,1.9292,1.1705,0.7619,0.8026,1.8948,3.4172,3.2984,6.5276,2.4141,0.3601,9.9586,5.7111,4.3278,1.0087,3.8907,4.0077,1.1908,0.3432,5.1746,0.0388,0.0438,0.0007,0.7937,0.6691,6.272,0.9,2.7277,1.4471,1.8584,0.1241,4.5553,2.4605,6.1697,5.879,0.9548,5.3519,0.7059,3.9908,0.0056,0.1701,0.3947,2.3132,2.1665,0.4571,2.1307,1.5732,1.7712,2.6494,1.833,2.2575,3.6598,1.4924,6.2841,2.0006,5.819,0.4604,0.9541,2.9825,0.8584,3.9889,4.315,2.0353,0.5439,6.1937,0.1675,3.6231,4.1113,1.8962,0.4949,5.1201,3.1949,0.1086,1.7408,0.2643,3.0372,1.3,1.5736,2.0925,3.071,1.7634,4.1754,4.2232,0.001,1.8998,1.4303,3.7838,0.1097,0.1803,0.0397,4.7775,5.0909,1.9604,0.9023,4.2266,2.9725,0.2579,4.9975,6.3403,0.3261,0.4049,4.0676,3.4092,0.0034,2.2752,3.7278,2.0165,1.4741,4.907,3.4828,1.4787,2.4476,0.8703,3.8843,2.1386,4.8623,0.5527,0.1536,1.2371,3.2426,4.787,5.0145,2.2633,3.6056,4.4855,0.0199,3.3892,0.6488,5.203,3.3177,4.8418,0.5278,4.7342,6.1306,5.8288,1.778,2.1358,0.3211,2.7597,2.985,0.5387,2.7359,2.3356,8.4697,0.3311,2.9746,2.034,0.208,0.0187,2.7207,0.3475,4.4335,2.7198,2.5198,5.9991,1.1628,3.9124,2.8145,3.6945,4.3254,7.7543,4.7695,3.7455,2.5087,2.701,1.4913,4.065,1.6088,1.5362,4.0172,0.4556,5.1925,3.2248,2.2607,0.6274,4.3875,0.0388,1.1152,5.1254,4.2716,1.7022,0.9083,0.0102,0.6734,3.0706,0.3639,0.189,0.0493,2.6382,0.7605,2.3841,6.0347,4.4596,5.6106,0.5708,2.4768,1.1594,2.1592,3.7701,4.8394,2.2939,1.7735,7.4127,2.9628,0.4677,3.0194,5.3129,2.6581,0.2744,4.0062,0.4985,1.8778,5.3241,4.5669,2.3936,5.4463,0.1029,0.0053,6.3241,1.7417,5.83,0.146,1.377,5.9565,1.8003,3.5158,3.6382,0.2538,0.0692,0.0049,1.3571,0.0063,0.1182,1.7193,5.4238,3.1352,1.6402,4.2882,1.5757,1.6185,3.1816,2.5694,8.3913,6.4554,6.5645,0.8845,1.9953,3.7701,3.032,4.7419,1.6493,2.4982,0.634,0.0908,0.0264,4.1663,1.8847,5.3969,0.2366,2.3468,3.1308,0.8757,4.7172,1.942,0.6622,1.2143,1.1762,6.2575,3.6583,1.9192,3.7031,0.0197,0.3215,1.2895,4.2919,5.5948,1.1967,0.1976,2.1524,3.5799,0.0522,1.4133,3.4434,3.0139,0.2342,6.1822,8.3977,3.7254,8.4072,0.5267,0.2374,4.084,4.1842,0.49,8.3186,2.5228,0.3833,5.3444,0.2488,1.7593,4.1583,2.5908,2.9957,0.0571,0.7909,4.5469,3.4241,0.2042,6.3444,0.7833,3.1934,1.8773,1.2776,4.1163,0.4113,2.3822,3.7283,0.4157,3.0112,0.0951,0.2119,2.4236,0.8584,4.6651,0.2747,0.2196,1.6237,1.6551,0.857,3.4051,0.1027,1.5925,7.0994,0.6921,2.7096,5.2599,4.8976,0.2748,1.3501,3.3831,1.784,1.9822,0.4791,2.9735,3.4108,0.2447,2.3683,1.0762,0.2919,4.0452,0.4659,0.5509,3.4797,0.5092,0.5248,0.5849,0.0063,0.0015,2.7226,0.1541,2.2361,0.0722,0.0081,2.7197,0.2766,2.482,7.9486,4.7678,3.3417,0.644,2.1632,3.8187,2.2111,4.7652,3.1964,4.469,5.6628,2.4123,2.4317,2.9736,0.1539,1.6603,4.1453,0.1354,6.7133,0.2307,0.0002,0.0036,0.295,1.8946,1.3827,3.2822,1.6113,0.6593,0.6019,4.4702,1.1054,1.4583,2.1883,2.3016,0.6019,2.2142,2.5957,1.2248,6.2668,2.7634,6.3391,0.2458,3.9746,3.0798,0.0102,2.973,0.9592,8.7583,0.1631,6.987,0.1491,5.0798,0.1619,0.7697,1.7454,0.3549,4.149,4.0727,0.0434,0.1171,0.0031,2.4663,3.1333,3.7569,9.2219,1.7874,4.1858,0.9321,4.5482,1.7003,0.8853,4.9645,3.4205,2.6257,1.4423,0.857,4.9651,8.4036,5.488,0.1274,0.4036,5.2679,0.7787,4.3706,6.1735,1.1745,2.0966,4.9747,4.2087,4.5767,2.6999,2.6712,2.0373,0.8871,1.0506,6.4364,2.7677,5.9191,0.1277,3.0045,0.227,1.196,1.289,3.5189,2.441,5.403,2.6295,0.2501,2.3782,0.5354,1.7064,2.7808,0.029,3.2295,3.8019,3.9036,3.2663,7.5738,1.2869,1.4995,1.1458,0.4,1.419,2.6516,5.3372,2.7661,3.1178,2.7914,5.5225,1.6602,4.5691,0.2719,0.0326,5.3463,2.7182,0.0183,0.0402,0.0039,2.343,0.191,3.4574,2.5359,7.9882,1.7888,1.9135,1.2

{"prompt":"Rewrite a story that you originally wrote as a kid .","text":"Rewrite a story that you originally wrote as a kid. You can also re-invent an original story you heard at a party or while playing video games.\nTry different perspectives. This could mean writing characters from different genres - a human with superpowers, something entirely unlike you; a superhero, you; an alien, you; etc. It could mean writing from multiple points of view. Take the story of the wizard in Harry Potter, you could have him telling each character from his point of view.\nFind a way to tell a story while talking to someone else. Ask your neighbor for an ear; read to your child one night. Read a book from beginning to end, but make it personal, and make it relevant to what you are talking about. Let your child tell you what he likes and doesn\u2019t like, and why. ( I did this when my kids were little, and they remembered what they read well afterwards.)\nTell a short story while you paint. I know, I know, it can\u2019t be the actual story, but you can write part of the story on a blank piece of paper, and then paint that part. It was one of the things that inspired me to write \u201cPrincess of Ice\u201d. Paint it, and then you can talk about what you saw while you painted, and you could tell a whole story about it.\nTell a true story about a time when you had to deal with a difficult situation. Your story could be about when a family member died.\nShare an event with a family member, a friend, a teacher, or a boss. Share something personal (a bad dream, a good dream, a fight that you had with a friend, a good\/ bad thing you did at school\/ work, a problem that you had with a parent, a memory that you had that was good or bad, something that happened in your childhood). Make the communication clear so the person understands the reason you share what you are looking for.\nMake an illustration based on a book you read. You can draw a new picture based on the book, or you can draw the character from the book and make them look like a different creature or animal.\nThe best part about these creative writing exercises; when you write your story you can tell it to someone else, and show them your work. This allows you to express yourself, and show how good you are at story telling. And if you write something, let it go. If you are not happy with a story, you can delete it. Even if you think it needs work, erase it and start again!\nSometimes, we need to push ourselves, and if you are feeling shy, or you are afraid that you will write something you feel is bad or awful, then try it. I remember writing a story in high school that I thought was awful, but when I reread it, I thought it was really pretty cool. I sent it to my teacher, and she decided to publish it as part of our class anthology. In fact, I still use it as a reminder from my past school days.\nRemember, there is always something you know that you have to write, even if it is just a few words. You are allowed to try to express yourself, and it is fine; you can try different things, and it is ok too.\nYou can change your opinion on some events, or words, and it is important that this is documented. What is important is that you are honest with what you are thinking and feeling, and you can tell it to whoever you want.\nBe creative, and do not worry about what other people will think about your story.

{"prompt":"The Summer Equinox is the day when the Sun is high in the sky for the longest time in the year . This really sucks for vampires .","text":"The Summer Equinox is the day when the Sun is high in the sky for the longest time in the year. This really sucks for vampires. Summer is not the time for them. In fact, I could have sworn I heard it in my subconscious. Maybe my head is still spinning.\nA small crowd of vampires surrounds the body of the young woman. They are all watching her. They are ready to leap to their feet as a signal of a fight. They have been watching her for several moments. But nothing happens. They are still not sure about her intentions. So the situation is rather uncertain.\nThe girl's face is set in a wide smile. Her lips are parted in a thin line. Her eyes look at us from long eyelashes in a rather unusual way.\n\"Very much. It is a very special gift. My family received it from my grandfather, my uncle told me. They told me it makes the owner able to transform and have more control over his power.\"\n\"It was a mistake in a joke. You should probably leave. I could get angry and come back later. The world is peaceful and you can stay here for a while. You will not get into trouble.\"\n\"It was just a joke because my uncle told me that he has seen the future. He saw me, knowing about the accident and said that I could leave \".\n\"You don't see me anymore. So I need to say goodbye now. Just know that I will remember all the good times \"\n\"It is not a punishment, believe me. Some people have other plans for me. They have to make me a gift. And I don't want that \"\n\"I really won't know, but I am glad that you didn't use my gift. I would like someone who can really use his power in the fight to be your boyfriend and not an untrustworthy vampire.\"\nShe smiles and walks away with her hands on her shoulders. The crowd gathers around her to see her going.\nThe scene turns and we are back to the village. The village has gone calm because the sun is setting. The villagers are just resting.\n\"I thought so. He must have told them something about my family. That was why they gave me the spell \".\n\"It can be. I have not seen how his girlfriend used her power. But I noticed that she could have defeated all the vampires in the village with just her hands. Those are very uncommon gifts to have. She must have it. But the only thing that really matters right now is that she has left the village. We can now try and find her \".\n\"Nothing. I think she went down into the stream. I think maybe she went fishing, or something like that \".\nThe girl runs through the forest and across the stream, walking through the forest on her toes. She finally reaches the stream. She runs into a small cave made from stones and slowly climbs to the top of the cave. She climbs into an alcove. A thick growth of vines covers the entrance. She climbs through the vines and slides her way to the entrance to the cave. The top of the cave is covered with water.\nThe river is calm. It is clear and cool. A large fish is swimming in the center of the stream. The girl grabs it and pulls it closer, getting even more excited as she sees the shape of the fish.\n\"Stop! Don't do this! Don't touch him! He will bite you and kill you.\" The girl screamed and her friend quickly ran away.\n\"The fish has been around a long time, but I only heard about it recently.

You turn around to find each squad member has their rifle pointed at your face. And you have just killed your comrade. How did you feel? Did you wish you had had the balls? Did you regret it? This story about two young soldiers will take you on a journey of emotional questions and answers. You will learn the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and life. A story that will resonate with all soldiers out there. A story of how one man came to change the course of the entire war.\nThis is a novel about 2 young men, a sergeant, and a rookie. On the face of it the story sounds similar to many other. But this story will take you on an emotional journey of learning something you never knew. An incredible story of love, bravery, fear, and family.\nA very gripping novel by an expert writer. This novel has many things in common with other fiction novels. I like to see things like that in a military novel.\nI really enjoyed the story of the war. It was a great story and it told the war very well. However, the ending was not great for some reasons. On the whole, its a story I will remember always and it just was not a big hit for me.\nThe story was good and the military side of WWII is interesting to read about. I like the way the author described the actions of the war. The pace of the story was good and it was very well written. I recommend this book to all those who like a good book. The author had a good way of writing the story and he portrayed the action of the war very well. The character development was good.\nI had a very good experience with this novel because it is very well structured. It is a true story and the author had done a good job in writing it. A nice balance was achieved between the historical aspect and the fiction aspect. The action is fast-paced and the story is well written. The voice of the voice is very interesting and I liked it.\nA beautiful story of two young soldiers. The story really moved me. It was easy to get invested into the story and it was difficult for me to put it down.\nA very good, well illustrated, and well documented novel. Great story! Great writing! And great subject to speak: the Second World War! Really a good story!\nI am a soldier, so I loved this story. The characters were unique and I felt like I was there. Thanks for sharing this!\nI wanted to read this book but it didn't have free chapter online. Instead, I bought it and have to say, it was excellent. Definitely will recommend this book to anyone reading in the future.\nA very cool story! It was very well written and the characters were very realistic. I particularly liked learning about the actions of some of the characters and how they were involved in their own personal battles. The writing style was also very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone reading in the future.\nThe book was very well written, all of it. However, it wasn't really my thing, the story of the two men, the war, the country, etc. Nothing was that special that I would like to see the author write another one.\nI liked the way the two soldiers in the story felt about their choices. They had their reasons and it was hard for me to think what I would do in a situation like that.\nI found this book to be very gripping and I was really interested to find out what happened to the boy.

{"prompt":"Guardian angels protect every human , and when the human dies , the angel dies . This angel is just as determined to live forever as its human is .","text":"Guardian angels protect every human, and when the human dies, the angel dies. This angel is just as determined to live forever as its human is. These angels go by the names of Magi, which means Magicians.\nIn the beginning of the story, the magicians know that Solomon is about to die, but they do not know the day. Eventually, it is revealed to them that Solomon will die the day of Yom Kippur ( the Day of Atonement ). When you go to Yom Kippur, you fast and sacrifice animals.\nBefore they die, the magicians take a vow to live forever, and to return to fulfill their vow at Yom Kippur. A little before they die, they sing a song about Solomon\u2019s reign. The singing of the song is a symbol of the music of the heavens surrounding our earth ( Solomon\u2019s kingdom ) like the singing of birds, and the songs of the stars ( Solomon as king ).\nAccording to Jewish tradition ( Ramban, Hilchos Siman 139 ), when a death is about to happen, the angels who know the person's last hours gather in front of Jesus' body in the room with the women and the disciples. They are going to prepare them to the next stage of the journey, leaving at its end the \"scales\" (Jewish terms to indicate a weighing, or the measuring of the soul) which will reveal the result of the battle in their heart. They come to Jerusalem to spend the last hours of Jesus life. When the women heard this, one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the Lord, saying to the disciples, \"Quick! Get into the upper room, before the Son of Man departs to a distant land, and you can't follow him.\" (Luke 22:51)\nAs you can see there is a lot of confusion on why these people would come to Jerusalem on a Sabbath day. But there is a much clearer understanding of why the disciples would be at Jerusalem on a Sabbath day. In the Synopses of St. Matthew and St. Mark that we will read today, it is stated that they arrived in Jerusalem. It is not clear to me if Jesus told the disciples to come to Jerusalem on a Sabbath day. We are unsure of when the disciples met or where they met this man that they were now calling Jesus. However, Matthew tells us that Jesus was the only one that knew he or she was going to be resurrected. Mark says that Jesus was the only one who could not lie (Matt. 27:2). Even though the details of when the disciples met this man have not been confirmed in the Hebrew scriptures, it is implied that they did meet him at some point.\nAs we now read this Gospel (John 6:53-70), we continue to see the early Church. We see the disciples in the company of Jesus. We don\u2019t see them alone nor we see them as a group. Today, we read the story of how Jesus taught the disciples the parable of the sower. All at once, I realize that the way Jesus was able to teach the parable of the sower to the disciples is the same way Jesus was able to teach the Lord of lords, the Father, to His own disciples. If I understand this correctly, it is not an out of the blue experience, it is only from within the Lordship.\nIn his Gospel, Jesus was teaching his disciples about the sowing of the Word. He told them that they only had ten or twelve loaves of bread. The disciples were so amazed that they asked him, \"How many do we have to eat?\" (Mark 6:45). They thought that the disciples did not understand the parable. This is a good question, but it is probably something that was not taught for many, many years.","token_len":794,"entropy":[6.6896,13.9728,7.8706,6.1308,2.2781,2.8098,2.3888,4.4517,2.3608,4.8995,4.0124,0.3442,1.6977,1.2679,4.412,1.365,3.3341,6.1049,1.4089,6.0578,2.2325,7.8473,1.0338,4.1692,3.7032,0.1651,5.8869,3.4027,5.9064,1.3474,5.5749,0.6008,5.8634,3.3587,0.8991,2.1391,0.3249,8.3151,1.2665,0.7293,4.247,1.005,7.205,2.3288,1.3457,2.0336,8.0601,1.3789,3.5172,2.7608,0.872,2.2982,0.4439,1.5796,4.358,0.2801,5.0476,1.2994,9.2332,1.7935,5.0374,0.0184,1.0042,1.1607,1.9182,1.5549,2.2027,0.0679,0.3391,2.9884,5.6686,2.6999,6.5757,0.3408,4.5006,0.5419,0.4087,2.0413,0.8769,0.1465,1.1469,2.4653,1.4439,4.958,1.0877,1.9491,6.4954,1.6901,0.1774,0.0,0.0,3.2031,9.1803,2.7058,0.172,4.5405,0.0199,0.0004,1.0372,3.6671,5.6025,3.3111,0.557,2.6568,0.0128,0.0801,0.0007,0.0008,0.5373,0.8196,11.6509,1.7277,5.9829,7.3365,1.7205,3.0229,5.7138,4.3448,2.6796,0.116,1.3833,2.036,0.0142,3.9778,2.0587,2.9165,1.0894,3.2276,0.7998,1.8596,1.0069,3.9627,4.7641,0.3198,7.9065,1.0436,0.954,4.5681,1.1949,0.001,0.0318,0.0014,0.0017,0.4211,5.1896,4.8131,3.3061,2.2976,0.697,0.0817,1.0451,5.6903,1.3501,1.4083,2.7839,3.3774,15.3615,7.9236,5.5477,7.5395,1.0265,1.9232,4.6685,1.7962,0.7664,0.2313,0.954,2.4973,3.0844,0.1524,1.2612,8.6049,1.1587,1.0611,4.6086,7.7289,6.0307,3.2555,4.1817,7.0175,3.4808,0.1784,0.2867,4.1369,3.4355,7.7216,1.3213,4.3954,0.0455,4.7469,2.5718,1.6667,1.3015,4.3232,0.9589,0.8615,3.1928,2.4825,2.5089,10.4664,3.248,0.7689,0.9536,5.6716,0.0148,5.0627,0.6067,3.8845,7.5678,3.2769,3.075,6.9853,2.0149,4.5293,11.5747,4.5073,10.6462,1.2636,2.5449,2.3311,6.6487,1.7984,4.0,0.0088,1.2535,0.2596,0.7843,1.5257,3.3912,5.23,1.0942,5.4675,3.1466,4.9205,5.5263,5.8462,2.3007,3.0826,0.0038,6.7688,2.6378,3.2969,3.3012,1.0789,7.3373,3.5379,0.8802,7.8181,1.9156,2.0022,5.9531,0.9155,1.9126,3.1284,4.1113,0.1239,5.1824,4.9751,2.0056,6.708,3.4481,4.0319,0.6536,1.5216,3.1026,1.6369,6.6631,4.7671,7.0115,1.2451,1.2844,5.7775,6.7088,3.558,0.9381,1.9146,10.0802,7.3496,5.6535,4.1397,3.4935,11.5545,3.4887,2.9537,4.1204,6.6473,0.9081,1.6086,3.5098,2.0645,3.4154,2.3423,5.9035,0.7462,6.8325,0.2558,0.6936,4.8372,3.4903,4.0233,3.0369,0.4943,2.9451,5.5897,1.1555,5.6555,2.088,6.5624,0.7671,3.2309,2.324,0.5091,5.3823,6.9229,1.454,3.2624,1.1175,4.0634,6.6701,1.3469,0.544,5.9947,0.0989,0.7709,3.3146,5.2751,0.0557,4.0242,1.9215,0.2295,1.7044,3.5224,0.3252,3.5744,3.9844,5.5282,5.1065,1.4033,2.4065,1.3477,3.283,0.6056,0.1619,9.4599,3.5789,5.673,4.0751,0.6732,7.7846,2.1568,1.5277,6.83,1.0591,6.3436,0.1561,0.1973,8.9533,0.0026,3.5451,5.4902,4.4832,2.0255,1.3257,0.6531,2.9482,4.2932,5.5591,5.1106,0.7761,2.3836,2.6326,4.6253,3.7287,0.0225,5.011,2.0235,0.8198,3.9581,2.5681,2.1561,0.2037,5.7735,0.9105,0.9761,2.3165,0.3575,3.4071,3.6152,6.4667,3.0039,2.5704,3.0665,2.9209,0.3935,1.3688,4.9366,1.7241,4.7409,0.8694,0.9251,4.2225,3.1071,0.4845,1.9419,4.3842,3.0781,3.4615,0.6853,1.2307,1.852,3.8041,1.1305,4.2114,4.1331,1.8493,1.2066,0.4004,1.2597,0.1829,0.67,3.4317,1.1169,7.8279,7.1834,0.3491,0.7056,4.306,0.2258,2.8475,1.7473,1.5962,0.0009,1.9531,6.5755,2.8884,3.9928,1.6413,4.1483,0.2133,3.2601,0.4899,2.0259,0.5516,2.8116,3.8221,1.6169,0.6276,6.2027,3.1671,0.3822,2.8683,1.5654,2.8988,1.2777,2.7633,4.1121,5.254,1.939,0.6184,1.4136,1.5632,0.6876,0.4079,1.3136,0.3274,0.718,0.1175,1.5869,4.1189,2.8686,7.1031,1.9749,4.0082,1.8657,0.942,6.2179,4.9617,2.0035,0.344,2.3775,4.6782,5.7253,5.2781,1.5543,2.1417,6.6173,5.984,2.9625,0.8824,3.4331,0.083,5.6546,3.1071,0.4771,0.3432,2.1869,2.6159,4.5021,3.4593,0.3954,2.372,3.3704,6.3571,9.0972,0.1994,0.8268,2.7256,0.0976,1.8863,5.4963,1.1874,3.8622,2.4915,0.5476,1.3693,1.9869,2.8865,0.584,0.0648,0.7704,2.7951,4.3179,7.0676,4.1337,4.7782,0.4742,3.6804,0.0244,4.4762,1.3291,5.6155,1.6066,1.9271,7.511,0.6103,5.9103,1.6633,0.3011,0.9025,2.6336,0.0721,3.6413,1.2397,0.2048,3.3905,3.2834,1.2267,5.3685,1.951,0.196,1.1915,0.5659,5.7865,0.2736,1.5175,2.1284,2.2702,1.3881,2.2211,2.1869,0.6458,1.903,1.2447,3.8496,1.5977,4.4831,1.9594,4.3355,7.2475,4.2932,4.6416,3.5298,0.02,5.864,1.372,6.6528,0.4893,1.8167,7.7438,0.4106,1.5661,1.5304,6.4526,3.4107,4.6115,3.1165,1.7393,1.4304,4.4182,3.1625,1.1931,6.6815,0.0124,2.2995,1.8861,1.604,6.4835,10.6718,1.3098,0.1053,0.591,1.4355,5.8348,5.824,4.5408,0.3814,0.5048,2.2806,1.8345,0.5346,0.8856,7.7638,0.7939,1.0587,4.4374,2.2352,3.2581,0.1441,3.5642,1.8957,5.8006,1.0693,1.0836,3.6247,7.4242,0.1415,0.276,0.5333,4.9557,3.2465,1.938,5.9479,6.6767,0.4614,0.619,4.9712,6.3818,0.7916,2.0303,5.8353,2.7568,3.5247,3.3786,0.0017,1.2186,0.9181,2.3876,0.0304,0.6274,0.1676,0.0457,0.0053,4.9694,0.6455,0.6402,1.0537,3.7061,0.8576,0.6803,2.6278,1.5306,0.0286,0.0122,0.1164,0.43,6.4377,4.5281,5.8815,3.2332,2.3419,5.7893,1.8252,1.5728,4.6815,3.8357,1.6473,0.4625,4.4642,3.2478,3.645,2.4742,1.0762,0.0787,2.5101,0.9779,2.8579,4.0285,5.336,1.4158,2.2181,4.2293,6.8692,2.0903,2.7575,0.1054,4.8928,6.8409,4.3577,0.9572,9.9646,1.9671,1.5162,1.2926,2.8414,4.4119,3.8735,0.7578,0.8109,3.4967,3.0331,4.7327,0.4907,3.7184,0.6857,2.1631,4.2712,0.2642,0.9159,6

You enjoy your existence for a while, until you realize somebody else is modding as well. You backtrace their IP address and it's coming from someplace NOT earth... You begin to get mad, and realize you are in reality another person. That person decides it s time to get rid of you since you are not being productive. The main issue in the game is you decide what to become and what to do. You are not under the control of another. Also, the more you discover the game, the more freedom you have, and also the more possibilities.\nSounds interesting! I haven't seen this title outside a few blogs, so it really caught my attention! I don't play much strategy games, or rpg's, that is. I do like watching movies, reading books, and being an avid gamer. But I haven't seen the game called Garry's Mod, or any other games that involve a virtual simulation. I'm going to check it out now. Thanks!\nIf you can find a copy of Garry\u00b4s Mod check it out. The only downside to the game is it's a little buggy at first, but after a little practice you get good at it.\nI just finished playing the game and I really enjoyed it. It was definitely like nothing else that I've ever played. The game isn't too complex but it does have good strategy in all the areas of the game.\nIt is very different from most other games. The only thing that bothered me is that it is quite a long game so you have to play a lot if you want to clear all the levels. It is worth it though! The graphics are also very nice and the game plays quickly. It is very unique and different also because it is not a linear story that all the characters are related to one another. Each character has their own story and their own purpose and all of the characters help out in the end and that is what makes this game so unique. When it comes to the graphics and the way that the game plays it is very unique because it just takes you on a different adventure with different characters and different locations. As for the music it is very easy to get into the game because the music just fits with the game. The sound effects are also very nice and the game is easy to navigate around. When it comes to the story it is very good and it is pretty interesting just like the game is. The only thing that really bothered me was there is no save feature in the game and there was a few things that didn't really work right. Overall this is a great game to play if you want to take a break from the everyday hustle and bustle. It is relaxing and you just play the game to get into a different world or other world and it is very relaxing and you just sit back and play and enjoy a relaxing day or just sit and think about things that you can't think about when you are doing everyday things.\nJust found this! Im going to buy it after getting up to my daily quota for the day for my computer.\nIf you are not a programmer, you might find it a bit difficult. But I found that once I figured out the basics, I could create all sorts of games in it.\nI love the graphics and the atmosphere. It's a different sort of game but that in itself makes it so unique. I also like the gameplay system because I don't have to deal with much if a person dies.\nI really like the graphics. I really like the gameplay, but there are some bugs and I'm not sure anyone else has seen them that I could use. Maybe someone can fix them? Anyway, I think the game should be free, and I'd be willing to pay for that in case it is possible to make an update.","token_len":796,"entropy":[5.7159,9.8638,1.2896,7.6878,2.2057,7.5343,3.1206,11.729,5.6907,2.3973,10.3215,4.6223,2.4789,8.2691,4.9021,5.6442,1.9108,0.299,8.078,2.4551,1.3031,2.2799,5.6659,3.3994,7.0724,4.6329,1.2014,0.859,1.5525,3.2289,0.4066,1.7462,9.4913,0.9268,1.1547,6.2454,0.0667,7.409,0.0522,0.3223,2.3055,8.4571,11.2398,4.0798,4.4657,2.2231,1.3949,4.9074,1.2862,7.7874,1.7603,4.5687,3.6357,10.9716,9.3755,5.2567,3.8124,5.4139,0.3896,3.5438,4.8017,2.4297,1.7825,3.6076,1.575,2.3333,3.3463,5.3038,5.3572,2.3566,1.5294,4.4292,1.6385,6.3294,4.0159,11.0566,2.7277,0.1796,3.4106,2.2865,0.0038,0.2593,7.2739,0.7312,1.1124,2.6628,4.5295,6.8066,0.9098,3.2016,6.0638,4.7137,4.1687,2.3141,0.9699,0.2252,2.963,5.5484,3.0631,1.3537,7.1688,1.7254,1.4023,0.9418,1.175,1.0791,1.3918,2.5664,2.6647,7.6688,1.3603,0.8015,0.0431,3.0799,3.1084,6.771,0.8669,2.613,4.8778,0.8324,6.5871,2.2459,3.2663,1.4769,0.0479,0.2549,7.0625,0.3061,1.7072,3.1342,1.1275,5.6371,0.7026,0.4625,7.04,3.275,2.9014,12.2178,3.6273,3.4778,2.4047,5.2871,0.3437,2.9626,2.6654,6.2787,7.2089,5.5576,1.7613,6.6001,1.5476,1.7053,2.7697,3.9055,4.6736,0.1234,0.4352,2.9181,1.7758,4.1908,0.1882,5.3409,3.1838,6.0718,0.3237,0.7302,4.419,7.9355,0.0614,2.4969,0.6333,6.0744,5.4269,1.9236,1.0235,3.5339,1.8732,6.588,3.0445,1.2033,4.7297,1.2536,0.439,1.2078,4.8247,4.3318,2.7084,0.5981,0.43,3.0114,1.4024,3.9882,0.0165,2.1313,2.6666,1.4059,6.7514,8.9258,0.1014,0.0524,1.9833,2.2125,2.384,0.7183,3.8541,1.3179,4.1963,3.2701,5.6767,6.3657,0.8406,1.3239,3.0772,4.2479,0.08,5.0487,1.198,0.0185,4.3403,1.1455,5.0068,2.4961,0.769,4.1764,0.23,4.3419,2.8452,1.7713,2.9078,0.2653,2.6289,8.4938,0.0078,0.1457,6.9419,1.1113,0.0131,1.887,3.2773,3.6499,3.8386,1.6356,2.556,0.5518,0.1781,2.6888,2.2559,2.1095,3.3304,2.9762,3.4916,1.9434,0.8985,0.4759,2.7833,1.2053,4.004,2.326,1.2286,2.3369,4.2983,1.0945,0.7693,0.3661,2.348,2.1228,4.3216,2.6097,1.4595,1.5928,0.7051,1.234,1.4886,3.2609,1.4594,0.4587,0.3175,1.8745,2.3289,4.7029,5.9657,5.9618,1.938,3.7079,0.132,0.9195,1.3401,0.6306,0.7256,2.4511,1.9956,4.7757,1.333,3.6531,3.0871,3.7719,0.8232,2.5436,1.2236,6.086,5.8234,4.1204,5.2777,1.4954,2.317,3.2079,1.509,0.1597,0.5318,2.4331,3.4576,2.2188,3.1602,5.2139,0.3453,2.5538,1.2145,1.3267,2.7515,1.8757,3.2548,1.3911,0.87,5.1484,0.006,2.0757,1.1451,1.6782,2.049,4.3458,2.3235,1.7762,0.3822,4.1335,1.9148,1.2056,0.1324,2.8274,1.4419,0.5874,4.852,0.0304,0.2574,0.1021,8.7206,3.2304,0.6609,2.965,0.6838,2.1228,1.3571,5.6347,1.7081,1.9088,3.7551,2.7481,3.5107,0.4645,3.9272,1.3525,1.4189,1.5287,1.5727,1.7072,3.6329,6.1765,1.0194,2.2766,1.1715,2.2894,4.9891,1.2693,4.7869,7.9957,3.4172,1.6866,0.9763,3.3846,1.2892,5.1077,3.4997,3.8507,5.8719,1.1012,1.9971,1.728,3.3243,1.0824,4.7657,0.076,0.3996,5.4856,0.9666,0.5578,1.0493,0.0364,2.0198,1.1211,3.0123,0.4375,5.3293,2.4118,4.9277,1.6884,1.5113,2.1455,6.7236,3.8971,1.4966,1.8826,3.4679,3.7191,3.7156,0.9675,2.0063,0.7861,1.7133,0.1925,1.5643,1.1078,0.3252,5.8384,3.185,0.2081,0.0934,1.3907,2.9942,2.6589,1.1243,4.7402,2.616,0.9512,0.5936,1.3616,1.9484,0.5253,1.3031,2.8434,4.8208,1.2888,5.4744,3.2482,1.5114,2.7104,0.2657,3.4862,2.7879,3.3736,1.5262,1.4276,1.5358,1.3923,4.7016,0.4652,5.242,2.3543,0.3582,2.5437,2.4182,0.4718,1.3766,5.4793,0.2544,3.288,1.3574,2.8764,1.2923,3.0045,1.7694,1.0688,5.3948,4.3322,4.3196,0.3282,1.4718,1.0943,1.5737,2.7612,0.9599,0.4536,2.1731,0.6404,1.231,0.9095,1.9141,1.8845,1.2643,4.7276,0.0604,5.153,4.8442,0.8813,4.9118,1.3702,0.0308,0.0476,0.6223,2.0397,1.5869,0.3931,1.3945,3.2212,1.2959,2.0996,1.2099,4.2971,4.0389,5.4914,3.002,1.6222,2.46,3.0791,0.3787,1.9801,2.8021,1.3292,0.3814,2.7954,0.4922,0.0026,0.7309,5.0627,1.3699,2.5704,5.6602,3.4011,3.4414,0.2907,0.1305,2.3159,2.7164,3.1627,1.9725,3.7821,2.4568,0.434,2.9185,0.3451,3.0047,1.7384,4.5023,0.8942,5.0616,2.9672,1.1661,0.4505,1.9293,0.2161,2.7944,0.7127,2.2219,0.0259,1.6628,0.2113,4.4752,1.6104,1.2814,0.3994,1.4196,6.3812,9.3223,0.0243,0.2913,0.0536,0.0598,1.9627,2.4595,0.8786,8.7573,1.0491,3.2928,3.4487,6.7894,1.7393,0.0699,2.9641,1.7939,4.9888,2.4451,1.9908,2.3896,3.4344,5.7997,3.9506,2.4619,2.4903,1.2144,2.3949,3.5557,1.8222,2.6787,1.438,4.6841,1.1424,0.1603,4.1116,2.7443,0.8669,4.5522,2.9705,3.218,3.1099,4.3218,3.0878,2.6366,5.077,0.4158,3.4137,3.0572,0.9021,3.1245,2.9124,3.6559,0.5771,4.9244,0.1362,0.7286,3.1127,6.2691,1.3419,0.4235,1.1767,5.5028,5.9424,1.2276,6.4938,7.4953,2.536,0.0242,3.6404,1.1454,4.9891,5.0979,5.7479,1.6217,4.0749,5.4484,5.5316,3.0004,1.5395,1.0515,4.9878,3.5844,3.915,0.8789,2.0743,3.5924,0.1708,1.9424,3.5633,1.63,4.5003,1.4594,1.7891,2.698,2.8265,1.771,1.9921,0.9043,2.3037,2.6723,3.4755,1.9677,3.1444,2.5743,5.5587,1.4515,4.2295,0.4809,1.7216,2.3057,2.2406,0.8672,2.5545,5.1933,4.9047,1.5083,0.0061,1.7524,3.683,2.8339,0.6244,3.1592,1.6252,3.9883,1.841,4.0318,1.2632,0.8971,5.8793,1.149,1.9562,2.9725,1.7102,5.7846,4.0907,0.0035,0.9459,3.2993,3.823,8.0406,0.281,2.2228,0.3872,3.5775,2.545,0.3911,1.7828,3.1615,1.3415,0.7435,3.7984,4.9726,2.8224,2.4646,2.7234,0.3893,1.6774,0.

{"prompt":"You 're in the process of taking a broken modem back to the store when you 're struck by lightning . When you wake up you find you can access the Internet with your mind , the only problem is it 's spotty and disconnects constantly .","text":"You're in the process of taking a broken modem back to the store when you're struck by lightning. When you wake up you find you can access the Internet with your mind, the only problem is it's spotty and disconnects constantly. You decide to take it to the repair man, but by the time you arrive he's moved on to next door.\nTo begin the process from an emergency mode in Mac OS X, you may follow the following steps:\n1 - Choose System Preferences and then select Startup & Shutdown.\n2 - From the list of programs to the left, click on the Networking options that you see.\n3 - From the menu that appears, select Internet Connection, and make sure that no other network connections are active.\n4 - On the screen that opens in front of you, there will be four categories. In the left column you will find a \"Reset Internet Connection\" button. Pressing it resets the Internet connection to the default settings that came with the Mac. In the list of Internet providers that are available, you'll find MacFone, a provider that supports several features on different OS X devices. You will be asked to enter the user\/password for the internet, as well as some information about the Mac itself. Click Save.\n5 - Once this has happened then if you need to connect you can click on the Refresh button to update the settings. This should fix any issues that you may have experienced.\n6 - When you are done with your internet, you can start the Internet Connection again, with your choice of connections.\nHow to use the IP address, when connecting to the web if this method fails\nThe IP address is what you use to access the Internet through a computer or device. For example, a Mac operating system includes an IP address called 53.89.9.1. This is because the computer is located on the 53rd floor of the NYC garage where Jobs used to work. When you go to the Mac's settings page, you will see an entry for the IP.\nA web page, if it is an IP address, will generally use a \".com\" suffix so that all addresses are easy to identify. You can view the IP address with Wireshark as shown at the bottom of the screen. In fact, if you've ever used Wireshark you will notice that it has a command to show the IP address of a particular connection.\nYou may use the IP address to connect to the Internet even if your Mac is offline or if you have accidentally changed the settings. If the Mac is offline, you can access the Mac's settings page directly from the web and follow the steps listed there. If there is no IP address, you may press \"Refresh\", as shown in my answer. This method fails in some cases but you may still be able to find an IP address for your Mac. In this case you can do something like this:\n1 - Choose System Preferences and then select Startup & Shutdown.\n2 - In the list of programs that appears to the left of the screen you will find a program called \"Netstat\", which is located under the Startup Files tab. Press the \"Show All Connections\" button so that it appears in a table.\n3 - In the same tab you may find a program called \"Firewall\", if it has come loaded from a factory installation. If it isn't there, click the \"New\" button to create a new rule in the Firewall. Here you can block all incoming connections.\n4 - Select the Firewall rules, and then click on the \"Add\" button and choose the \"IPv4 rules\".

{"prompt":"Artificial intelligence has been perfected , but instead of humans uploading themselves to robot bodies , robots want to download themselves into humans .","text":"Artificial intelligence has been perfected, but instead of humans uploading themselves to robot bodies, robots want to download themselves into humans. Robotics engineer Paul Bostrom, at Humanity+ and Oxford University, claims we are already there. At a UN conference on artificial intelligence at a conference in Geneva, Bostrom argued that we should be at the very beginning of a gradual process, where human bodies could become machines.\nThe key to his thesis : \u201c Human bodies are already being replaced by machines, in the military \u2013 where humans are trained to be drones, for example \u2013 and in other areas such as the factory floor. \u201d But Bostrom wants to go further, and say that, as time goes on, we may actually end up having robots that have human organs and tissues. These robots are not meant to be autonomous machines, in the same way an iPhone is not meant to fly or operate on its own. Instead, they\u2019ll be meant to \u201c support \u201d humans :\n\u201c What we should think of is, as the robotics capabilities of today\u2019s computers increase, not as a threat to humanity but as an opportunity. If we are to survive, humans must learn to make machines that can do our jobs. In this respect, we must be prepared to make many \u2018 transitions \u2019 ; from a world where the bulk of work is done by robots to one where they work in tandem with us, or to one where they carry out our tasks completely. We should develop policies which recognize this. \u201d\nAnd who knows whether the process of robots downloading into humans will end up being irreversible. And who knows the future implications.\nA friend of mine is running for political office. My friend is a great talented writer and a very good candidate for public office. The political system for local elections in the Philippines is very unfair, particularly for people like my friend who are not wealthy enough to pay the large contributions needed to run for office.\nMy friend\u2019s campaign has been greatly hindered in the past weeks. This week, the campaign manager of my friend\u2019s opponent has been murdered as my friend\u2019s campaign is in a tight race.\nIn a few days, the campaign will begin and we will watch as the pressure mounts. The man the campaign manager has been murdered is the candidate of the major party.\nMy friends campaign is going to need this week to focus on their opponents. I will be keeping my eyes on my friend. Watching him try to make contact once or twice a day, asking how his opponent\u2019s campaign is doing.\nMy friend\u2019s campaign is a tough road ahead. People\u2019s trust in the political system is not great, and there are plenty who do not want to see his friend succeed.\nI also feel that my friend should have won his campaign if he had done his research. The man he chose to do his campaign is not someone he feels comfortable with. If my friend had focused on his opponent\u2019s strengths, he could even lose the election, but he was already down.\nTo me it seems his time was wasted, and it cost the campaign man his life. I suppose he would rather have my friend win, but I would like to see more of my friend.\nThese days, there is a great risk of people like me seeing political campaigns in a negative light. Political campaigns are a way for people to make a contribution to a political party, but if the public sees campaigning as an opportunity for corruption and violence, we will see campaigns with no chance.\nI am a fan of American politics and wish there was a more open and honest system. I would even like to see a more transparent system, like in Sweden, but the political system for local elections in the Philippines is corrupt. Money is not the only thing that corrupt people use, but I think the system is corrupt by

{"prompt":"Lots of people sell their souls in a deal with the Devil . You 're the first person to sell their soul in a deal with God .","text":"Lots of people sell their souls in a deal with the Devil. You're the first person to sell their soul in a deal with God. God's ways are not always known by men. If it happened to me I would gladly die as a Christian. Yes, I believe this.\nDear Sir, I am very much thankful to you for ur kind reply to me. My father did not attend seminary and he never visited a church. He studied in private school. He died with no religion whatsoever. But we were told, that if we attend seminary and are members of a church we can be saveds. We went to seminary where there are only 1 or 2 members, however the pastor said,\" you are not saved, till you are baptized.\" After he baptized us, he said,\" now you are the Christians.\" We were forced to take \" the Communion.\" He said,\" You are Christians and so you take the Communion.\" My aunt always said.\" He said to me,\" you cannot come with me because I do not know how to pray.\" He only said it. I was very scared and I was afraid to go on the other hand he wanted me because he wanted me to sell my soul. I do not think my father is a Christian man. He was raised in a small town where there are no churches, he saw no sign of God anywhere, he worked at the factory all day long. The first time I went to seminary was at the age of 15. After that the other boy said. \" I will join you.\" When the year finished we decided we would all join together. There were 3 of us. We were all boys. The pastor of the church told us that we were all going home. In the end we all decided not to be a member of the church. We joined the same mission and were all baptized as Christ's disciple. I could not do that. I said, \"You are a Christian so you pray like Christians.\" When the first year finished, we had a new president, he thought we were all Christians but he said,\" you are not Christians.\" (we could not say we were Christians, we were all in the same mission and could say only \"Christians\", not a member of a church.) After he was elected as the president he said to us that we were not Christians so you must sell your souls. I could not do that. My friends wanted to do it, but they refused ( they were very afraid to die). In the end my mother gave their consent to us. When we were on the verge to get baptized as Christians, my friend had the idea to make money. So that is when he and his girlfriend put me in a shop and told the clerk that I was the owner. When they tried on me, I did not speak. After I was taken to where the president slept he told us,\" you are Christians so you talk.\" We said, \" we could not talk. \" After that I was taken to a shop where one of the ministers slept, and my mother told me.\" My son is a member of a church.\" He asked me, \" are you going to die to hell or live on. \" I didn't know what to say so my friend said. \" It is better to die to hell.\" Now I am very ashamed. I am also very sorry for my friend. I don't know why I did that. Can you help me? I don't know what to do. I do not know where to go. Please help me. I was very scared when I was forced to lie. I don't want to do this again.\nDear Sir, I am very sorry for the trouble I caused you. I did not know what I was saying. My friend did not mean to do that. I am really sorry.
