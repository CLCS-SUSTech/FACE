{"prompt":"Killing a person raises your life span by 20 years , but it comes with a cost .","text":"Killing a person raises your life span by 20 years, but it comes with a cost. When you kill a person you die 20 years early.The consequences of your crime are not taken into account. If you want to go to heaven, then you just put your life in the hands of the good God and then try to have some children. Once a person dies, he has no place or anyone to blame.\nIf you want to live longer and enjoy your remaining life, then don\u2019t kill a person. When a person dies, he leaves some children behind him. These children are orphans. They have neither mother nor father. They become orphans in their teens and they are left alone in the world. They become beggars.\nWealth and power are so fragile. They are easily taken from man. Death is the only way to get wealth and power back.\nHearing one more sound from that woman would have been all she had left. She had been holding her body together, her hands still on the wheel on her bariatric scooter, but she had lost one other source of equilibrium as she saw her life flash through her mind so rapidly.\nShe hadn\u2019t been expecting him and she knew he wasn\u2019t going to let her out of his sight. She couldn\u2019t trust her memory but she believed his words.\nThey were on foot; she could almost touch the snow from her nose. No one had thought to check her car but she was pretty sure the car was going to be fine. She didn\u2019t even know she had taken it out of her garage that day.\nShe could still feel the weight of the car trying to shove past her, trying to escape. The only sound she could make was a cough. She was getting lighter. She had managed to keep her eyes open a split second longer than the last, before everything flickered away and she was on the floor, in the snow.","token_len":400,"entropy":[9.9538,3.4455,3.5793,9.7453,3.3722,3.8682,6.8319,2.2779,3.5218,0.7723,1.5383,2.0448,2.2675,6.6833,0.8036,0.9905,2.3742,0.8068,4.1138,0.9525,2.0425,1.1104,0.4186,2.1577,4.8781,4.0271,0.1812,4.4845,0.8277,8.6032,6.59,0.87,2.6769,5.8975,0.8292,3.2419,7.5561,0.5783,0.1909,1.4643,2.7526,0.3908,4.7873,0.193,3.78,1.1963,4.4425,0.7397,3.3713,0.742,5.4383,6.0134,1.574,0.8202,1.5629,1.8369,0.1582,0.0049,2.0059,4.8032,3.8589,1.9525,3.1896,5.1902,0.1523,5.8924,3.7262,5.1625,0.7119,6.0571,2.9896,0.9456,2.704,0.9199,2.8063,3.2541,1.9179,3.5346,5.5373,6.6655,0.2775,4.7031,1.1642,3.6827,9.9595,0.425,2.2424,0.1515,2.7926,4.2651,2.3842,4.9385,1.9573,8.0314,1.275,0.4246,0.5776,4.7643,15.7708,8.5636,0.6375,1.6485,1.4837,0.3013,0.6929,4.7521,2.5266,0.2387,0.8658,0.5997,1.4137,5.0378,4.6407,3.7827,1.52,3.9267,0.9979,5.4778,0.364,1.3829,5.95,1.5319,2.3122,2.3086,7.5136,5.7815,0.2472,0.0479,0.8976,1.5473,5.5291,1.8053,3.1761,2.0044,5.5364,0.981,3.2264,1.9659,3.345,3.0141,1.8858,1.1005,1.7878,0.5765,2.5488,3.0696,7.3674,0.0084,1.7228,2.0261,5.4255,4.4344,2.6275,2.0528,1.1471,4.5307,6.131,2.1178,2.7848,1.4446,5.3313,4.2862,1.5234,7.9712,1.1003,6.6154,1.2329,1.904,1.2817,0.8999,0.4973,2.5509,4.5344,0.7396,0.0701,5.2537,0.3498,1.9108,6.0483,4.2276,4.4558,7.9782,4.9828,3.8181,5.1259,4.7048,5.2528,3.0229,1.2737,5.8502,5.1877,1.8487,2.1503,0.848,1.8234,2.4263,2.5636,6.3029,1.9579,6.8855,4.2856,2.3248,3.1685,2.9076,3.5928,3.6664,1.4605,4.1506,6.0421,1.2592,8.9796,6.8298,5.3941,0.4285,1.1365,2.6821,1.1527,1.5901,2.8384,5.0132,7.9043,7.6878,0.0493,10.2902,4.6454,2.1196,5.621,1.9275,3.5839,8.8836,3.1707,1.8078,1.0117,6.2798,2.9856,0.7395,1.2108,2.0203,5.7938,0.7224,0.3071,0.1008,1.9123,5.3961,4.6591,4.6068,1.7554,3.478,1.4613,3.6331,0.3488,0.0495,0.0081,2.146,0.0478,4.2432,0.7648,4.1816,0.8487,1.7407,1.0127,0.4395,1.5042,3.6464,0.1449,0.1234,0.0003,5.1962,3.0358,7.0798,5.9311,0.4817,5.1457,3.9631,1.948,1.0843,1.1273,5.0247,1.1914,5.9575,8.7609,6.9407,1.4158,2.5082,5.0116,5.5193,1.9401,6.006,4.1168,1.2489,5.91,0.8615,5.3465,1.2884,2.5251,5.1061,1.8322,4.2908,1.4674,4.8103,3.8797,0.9689,2.0021,6.3738,0.0682,3.0233,2.8114,0.8868,2.8303,0.3747,1.6418,4.9975,0.3682,1.5509,2.8674,0.0801,0.0298,0.0013,2.7362,1.6309,3.1355,1.4326,4.7622,2.3834,2.3005,1.3341,0.3744,8.3196,5.1681,0.8685,0.4336,0.9295,1.436,3.439,4.3564,1.2537,0.7585,3.9152,0.402,1.2717,1.6867,7.3842,0.024,6.1294,4.6857,0.0818,2.2953,3.9683,0.0724,5.386,1.6448,2.6493,4.0429,4.1416,0.7393,1.0794,1.6531,0.5428,2.0416,5.8989,1.0718,1.5535,2.5107,4.339,7.469,2.004,1.2857,2.8432,6.3217,0.0491,2.8372,0.8701,3.0479,1.0563,4.1398,8.4681,0.0313,2.6767,0.7246,3.2284,2.4149,4.0216,4.2483,6.6432,7.888,1.9288,0.0,3.3539,2.4693,1.017,2.0527,4.1183,0.8903,3.1837,2.2695,4.8742,1.2998,1.438,0.6801]}

{"prompt":"The Fall ( Replies MUST be at least 1,000 words or longer )","text":"The Fall ( Replies MUST be at least 1,000 words or longer ) \u2013 A post in which your character returns with a new outfit, a new weapon, or a new place. The new outfit and\/or weapon would probably be revealed in the opening chapters of the post, if I were writing this. The new place would probably take place after that storyline and wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. It would happen so fast that I doubt I even realized until I\u2019d done it.\nThis means you don\u2019t have to plan out all the details of what happens in each particular storyline; your character just comes in and goes out. The Fall isn\u2019t a character\u2019s first introduction to the world \u2013 it\u2019s an afterthought \u2013 but since I don\u2019t want to have my characters be overpowered, I have to force your characters to put themselves at risk.\nThe Fall is a post in which your character makes a mistake. I.e., something which has to be rectified immediately.\nWhen one side is down and it doesn\u2019t matter what I say or do, they are all set\u2026until I get here and kill \u2018em.\nSome have argued that it is better to write a sequel to a previous story; in order to introduce a new character, to set up a new storyline, and so on.\nWell, as long as you write about it, you could probably write multiple storylines in one post. For example, in the middle section of the Fall, I wrote about another girl \u2013 a demon girl. In the future, I might come back with a storyline about that character (and more on that later).\nOne more thing: this won\u2019t work well when you plan out multiple storylines to be read in one post \u2013 the structure of the story will be all messed up. It\u2019s the same as putting a long storyline in a single paragraph of your post.","token_len":400,"entropy":[10.1043,4.4888,14.936,4.7728,11.631,0.6091,4.0834,0.1266,3.1961,3.9095,0.3592,0.4763,2.66,2.2988,1.5917,6.1561,4.8745,3.7025,3.9921,2.3355,4.3794,5.1072,8.0476,4.8239,1.0682,1.9434,5.5268,1.5261,3.3592,0.7073,1.9084,0.3406,0.8035,1.0011,0.4994,6.5986,2.9444,3.227,4.4626,1.22,3.6111,6.2478,0.0006,0.2821,5.6695,6.2027,0.8127,6.217,1.3037,0.7706,7.1142,4.6053,0.7393,0.4789,6.0317,1.5162,4.0252,5.1507,2.9332,3.7581,1.8326,1.5583,3.0327,2.9787,3.0164,1.6092,2.2135,5.3671,0.8148,3.5727,4.6364,8.2565,3.833,5.6413,16.6262,7.5781,1.3704,0.6153,2.6863,3.4562,1.2873,3.8626,1.2213,5.4416,4.9113,1.6898,1.1576,1.4927,6.3253,1.7886,3.977,4.4652,4.3966,1.6725,10.6804,0.3026,3.5726,2.9532,1.4685,0.4522,1.8468,5.7063,4.311,2.8982,3.2945,0.4486,0.5337,0.3023,0.7282,0.1353,6.7572,2.3242,3.623,0.7802,2.8445,1.6533,2.5152,2.8412,1.2142,3.8844,7.6252,4.8055,4.8938,4.4228,1.0574,4.7192,3.8435,3.4051,0.763,3.5514,4.109,1.3618,2.9041,6.8848,3.657,0.7031,0.6515,0.035,2.0877,5.386,8.2774,0.0316,1.108,3.4504,4.3483,2.0324,1.419,0.7951,5.4435,0.7029,2.5747,0.0268,0.085,2.995,4.8494,0.2253,4.4612,2.5188,6.459,3.221,2.0622,0.1146,0.0388,0.0482,1.9174,0.6279,3.9885,3.4634,1.4086,4.3968,7.9723,1.661,0.478,3.889,2.2358,6.4087,5.5839,1.1734,0.1953,5.606,3.2769,3.2964,0.9302,1.3861,1.428,2.7883,0.8426,1.1376,1.3091,5.068,2.971,0.1481,1.0734,0.225,4.6779,1.0217,4.7304,1.6698,3.236,6.1856,0.0591,0.4455,4.2692,5.4349,3.8989,3.6978,1.1188,5.7364,0.0014,5.4485,1.1408,2.165,4.5783,5.7016,6.3309,2.6805,5.809,2.3424,4.5821,3.396,0.1098,0.1706,0.0422,2.8117,1.5119,4.097,2.2486,2.156,0.8049,0.5672,3.3928,2.0949,3.5419,6.6315,7.0169,5.4986,2.2113,4.3011,4.8353,3.5536,5.9655,11.7741,7.4998,5.5285,0.764,0.9285,5.4829,5.2398,3.095,0.1736,2.9845,1.0598,3.5921,0.3031,4.5847,1.5037,5.1871,0.8158,2.0678,2.2527,1.6717,5.4177,4.0136,3.9728,0.1892,6.6421,1.7725,0.1624,1.0655,0.7833,5.5537,5.1336,0.8997,0.9116,0.9194,2.8964,0.4545,1.8295,2.8162,0.193,0.9465,2.5452,3.6449,0.2482,4.8023,2.2236,0.0029,1.1022,3.449,4.5633,2.5973,1.1468,1.1087,5.859,3.75,2.2727,7.3867,4.9965,2.3255,1.6226,1.0645,0.647,4.7311,0.7477,0.2322,2.8546,0.9426,5.1951,5.3761,0.3986,0.7296,2.5982,0.6863,2.1614,3.562,1.5733,6.2278,4.7274,6.0953,2.4242,6.8732,1.9887,1.6745,2.6835,0.7287,6.5833,0.5505,0.6375,2.8266,5.7176,2.152,2.2855,0.8341,6.4306,1.1114,4.4164,3.1378,3.9096,2.7088,5.8974,3.5046,0.2609,0.5696,0.6834,0.7707,4.7286,3.9196,0.8427,0.934,3.6712,7.2411,0.6228,0.0797,0.0728,4.4923,3.8894,3.409,1.3429,6.2279,0.9711,5.9835,1.9629,4.6519,4.1024,5.5541,1.9656,0.6475,0.18,3.2612,3.4396,7.7971,0.6328,0.6152,1.0815,2.527,1.9715,5.4563,4.2019,0.0636,1.0821,3.5749,2.6642,0.0235,0.08,4.1272,1.6876,1.922,6.6723,1.4608,6.6228,6.3367,1.1176,1.4638,2.1849,4.9168,3.2729,2.7236,1.8995,0.7858]}

[ End of Cliche inbound ]\nIf there\u2019s any way to save your marriage, don\u2019t hesitate to share it with him. One of my best friends has a wonderful marriage in which she keeps the romance and intimacy on a regular basis. After much soul-searching and an unexplained absence of her husband at home, she revealed to her friends that she had been cheating on him with another man she met online. Her friends all expressed condolences and advice, but we were all amazed by her husband\u2019s response. She shared with us all the details of their relationship, from the first dates to the times she lied about her husband\u2019s work schedule, and then proceeded to tell us about their love-making. This revelation brought home for all of us what is possible in marriage. If we do what we want, we can keep our marriages, our children, our businesses, our churches and our lives. This doesn\u2019t mean that nothing bad will happen. But when we act like children, the worst things might happen.\nWhen you do something for him, or do something nice for him, or have a conversation about how much he means to you, don\u2019t be surprised if he acts like a child that you raised.\nWhen you don\u2019t want to speak to a friend, do not be surprised if he acts like a child that you threw out.\nWhat can you say or do that can be seen as unreasonable and even ridiculous by your children?

{"prompt":"You fell asleep in your self-driving car . You woke up in the weirdest place .","text":"You fell asleep in your self-driving car. You woke up in the weirdest place. Now you have to survive until you can find the other you.\" - Goodreads\nWhen her husband died in a freak car accident, Alice found a piece of her missing son in the wreckage. She decided to stop driving so she could focus on putting her affairs in order and helping her son navigate the fallout of what had happened. But things took a turn when she bumped into an old friend and started talking to her. And when she started to get lost in the forest she started to feel odd physical sensations, then more and more strange things started to happen.\nShe doesn't know where she is and she can't remember how she got there, but she's not alone, for the most part.\nThen she starts to feel even stranger. Like her body craves the sensation. That it needs to be touched. That it's an addiction. In the woods there are predators. The worst kind. There are some of them even stronger than she remembers. They're hungry for her. Then things start to shift, the forests change. The creatures change. And she begins to understand that not everything in her past is what it seems like.\nWhen she was still a girl, she was raped. She was terrified. She wasn't even sure she knew how she felt.

{"prompt":"You , a super-hero , bump into your arch-nemesis while in the checkout line at the local super market .","text":"You, a super-hero, bump into your arch-nemesis while in the checkout line at the local super market. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nAfter I put myself and my readers in the driver seat, I immediately feel a shift in my writing. The story flows much more easily and I can easily find the right moment to end and twist the tale, instead of the story forcing me to do so.\nIf you are facing trouble finding moments to end your stories, try this tip. You will feel like you\u2019ve finally found the solution to your writing blocks.\nIf there is a scene in your story you can\u2019t seem to put a stop to, try to put it to rest at the end of that chapter. If you can\u2019t think of a way, just wrap it up with a paragraph or a few sentences.\nI don\u2019t normally do this, but you do not have to write down each time you write a scene. Once your character is doing something, like a job, for example, and you realize that he or she makes decisions which might have dire consequences, that is the time to put a stop to this scene.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be all at the end; you can keep working with the characters. Try to leave things open.\nA little more explanation is in order. A scene can be made up of several paragraphs, and each paragraph can have several scenes.\nBut don\u2019t get stuck writing long paragraphs. Instead, try cutting several small scenes into each paragraph.\nI don\u2019t want to make you feel guilty for a second, but you also don\u2019t have to go crazy with your scene divisions.\nThat\u2019s because I can read your manuscript and then come up with a better way to organise the scenes together.\nThis entry was posted in Writing and tagged ending, writing on 3 April 2020 by evelynevanveson25.","token_len":405,"entropy":[3.4158,4.573,8.1037,1.5089,4.5751,1.0744,11.9428,0.5992,3.4027,7.3026,0.9236,1.8315,0.006,0.0047,5.4391,3.6372,1.3647,10.2084,0.4165,2.1564,1.7391,3.3321,6.7042,6.2309,1.0811,3.2485,16.1261,8.0026,1.7852,4.7164,1.6298,0.6604,3.7997,8.0507,1.3327,11.7677,4.7434,4.7642,5.6722,5.7909,0.4958,7.6445,1.5613,0.9961,2.5487,2.8655,1.135,0.6253,5.6917,6.7875,2.3898,5.0854,0.6731,0.6245,8.1709,0.9752,2.9062,4.1635,7.6522,4.9786,0.7911,3.1807,1.6559,2.2965,2.7177,3.8518,4.2271,1.8127,2.3387,4.0457,0.4019,5.6124,4.084,7.9315,1.2121,3.5495,3.1537,4.2624,0.0059,4.2435,3.9724,6.6134,0.3845,0.1486,3.4073,1.4929,0.4725,1.6984,4.3649,0.5588,2.3161,7.1443,6.0606,4.421,8.0141,0.6889,2.5721,1.3506,2.4776,0.3481,3.9983,2.2819,4.3421,1.6122,3.222,1.3204,3.4028,2.6814,0.534,10.0241,1.9531,1.252,4.2985,0.8351,1.3492,5.5957,1.5044,0.664,3.5959,9.5884,0.5103,1.0084,2.8521,4.4212,0.7297,1.2243,5.0196,1.5393,0.4572,0.4168,3.163,3.264,7.2148,0.6413,0.1618,5.8359,0.0636,4.9178,2.8771,0.7434,0.0187,0.4198,2.2151,3.842,4.1107,1.8037,3.3541,1.5766,4.8583,1.3583,0.6377,0.6387,4.7525,2.936,0.5854,2.9636,0.9331,2.124,1.4411,0.0519,0.0027,4.9842,0.2288,1.0201,1.5698,5.1199,4.2697,6.7084,1.4187,0.6217,1.9519,0.6577,4.682,1.6418,3.4342,3.0596,1.7168,1.0417,1.1394,2.782,4.0082,0.3924,0.4649,0.0208,7.5744,2.7228,0.6074,1.0035,0.366,3.9828,4.1596,2.9206,0.6678,0.0461,5.62,4.4444,4.6965,4.7513,0.4844,3.3988,1.4591,3.2165,1.0751,5.0647,3.4716,5.5259,1.2723,6.2028,1.8935,1.185,5.4844,3.3087,4.8707,1.0566,3.6704,0.5423,0.0979,4.1336,0.7858,5.0052,0.9752,2.992,2.2091,0.0035,6.0644,5.037,4.5432,5.0436,3.0599,5.2645,0.1885,0.844,3.6524,1.7235,2.3322,1.7437,0.5273,2.6844,2.2638,0.1862,0.3651,4.1619,1.6521,0.3969,0.736,3.7168,3.5836,0.3284,0.2227,0.0086,1.7023,0.0054,0.3511,4.6759,3.8102,3.5745,3.9694,4.5051,1.9129,0.5543,4.8474,5.075,4.0705,1.4339,3.3408,3.1426,4.7818,0.75,4.3832,4.1988,2.6176,2.9846,1.4191,4.6694,4.1937,2.6926,5.417,3.2081,1.9507,1.3086,0.7378,4.3043,1.4591,2.3678,1.0892,4.4912,2.2724,0.5059,2.7773,3.4968,1.3185,2.3562,2.3782,1.0861,1.7361,1.8318,3.2799,3.9033,0.8366,2.3711,5.7081,3.7916,0.1263,0.2251,0.0003,4.172,3.3575,4.6234,5.4447,1.512,0.9006,3.2461,0.2379,2.327,6.4443,6.7412,5.6223,1.7345,1.8417,3.9452,1.5915,0.6779,1.8177,2.8948,3.2708,0.0659,0.1298,0.0133,3.344,0.5147,3.2872,2.0979,1.5522,2.2546,1.6613,5.0349,3.6521,1.6541,0.5609,2.5974,5.7269,0.9671,0.0226,0.1296,0.0043,2.0449,0.0716,3.7943,4.4964,2.4329,2.9777,6.263,10.9686,0.4601,2.1209,5.1063,3.0414,0.1405,0.78,4.8437,1.9672,3.3935,5.8817,1.8228,6.3779,1.4989,4.7058,4.8899,1.6229,0.0087,1.2653,4.2798,2.3774,0.4311,10.4945,1.8702,1.4382,5.2614,0.2861,1.1061,3.614,9.4094,0.7718,0.0553,4.6006,7.203,3.4845,11.2077,13.5651,2.6953,4.1913,6.9169,7.0337,4.7425,10.6728,4.449,11.1276,5.5816,4.3666,9.1899,9.5265,2.8796,8.3366,1.2059]}
{"prompt":"on their 16th birthday , humans are given a box of 20 heart seeds . Eating someone else 's heartseed means you are gauranteed to meet them at least once more before either of you can die .","text":"on their 16th birthday, humans are given a box of 20 heart seeds. Eating someone else's heartseed means you are gauranteed to meet them at least once more before either of you can die. This event occurs in the game on August 30th 2020 at the age of 16.\nWhen it comes to taking care of your body, you might assume that it all starts with consuming food. While this is indeed the most important thing, it is only one part of the overall picture. Eating healthfully and properly does not have to equate to sacrificing the flavor or texture of the foods you eat. Here are some of the best tips to help you avoid those unhealthy foods, while still enjoying the best flavor of the food!\nFood flavor is a subject that most people love. It's one of the key reasons they choose a particular restaurant over another. This is where people often get caught up in the hype and try to use an artificial flavoring to enhance the taste of the food they eat. This is an important step on the right path, but it might not be the only way to go.\nMany people might not know this, but flavor is not only linked to food. Many people enjoy flavored or natural products like candies, sauces, condiments, candles, and even toothpastes. The key is that these products aren't just used when they are not directly associated with your diet. They can be an excellent complement to the flavor of your regular diet.\nIf your body has issues like constipation, you might want to consider eating foods that are cooked in a coconut oil. The best thing about coconut oil is that it can boost your digestive system to allow the body to absorb more nutrients, which can also help improve the taste of the food you eat. It also contains lauric acid, and is a great supplement. This may be a great addition to a diet focused on losing weight, as well as people who are concerned about increasing the amount of weight they put on.","token_len":405,"entropy":[6.6992,9.4152,1.8476,3.703,1.686,11.6878,2.1357,6.2179,1.5009,6.6807,1.2439,6.2919,7.9602,7.9818,1.6593,8.4082,8.5938,2.4323,0.1141,0.4662,4.673,3.5916,1.9827,2.611,9.2309,9.1445,0.0551,0.0756,5.3168,6.9898,2.915,3.1497,4.317,0.4646,5.0355,5.4803,7.4131,2.789,1.0781,2.98,3.7434,0.3064,3.3733,5.0917,3.6077,2.5751,1.6422,4.6551,5.1649,4.2146,3.5907,0.8718,9.1923,3.5901,1.688,4.2853,0.0089,2.0962,0.6223,0.7247,10.7408,4.3889,1.5824,0.0438,5.6459,1.784,0.0131,1.0136,4.2148,0.476,1.9979,3.9649,6.0893,0.448,3.1749,6.2458,2.7331,0.7228,7.0909,3.6178,0.8064,4.5587,1.4473,0.9399,5.7208,1.8618,5.5064,3.7044,2.1099,2.251,1.0323,1.203,3.76,2.1754,1.9328,0.0484,0.6111,4.2394,3.4408,0.6849,3.5281,6.0242,1.9374,2.5547,3.2947,3.8418,0.2765,3.6557,0.4217,7.6271,0.2023,5.774,3.4766,8.7377,2.6392,3.5575,0.1069,2.2059,3.0287,0.5503,0.6556,0.3457,6.5262,0.555,0.9509,1.621,0.095,3.1932,2.9433,1.8432,1.6554,0.3516,3.6393,5.4054,3.4517,2.0214,3.4267,4.1427,1.9123,3.9061,1.2268,3.947,4.7298,2.2737,2.5152,0.9601,4.9039,0.2771,4.9702,9.1885,1.6209,2.1605,6.2391,1.1206,3.2821,0.4176,5.8553,3.4212,2.2903,1.7195,3.3048,0.4374,0.2269,4.1811,2.7517,3.8315,2.6854,2.9018,4.3149,4.9778,1.1903,1.6092,0.6132,3.7522,1.0193,3.6412,4.2905,2.7852,2.9507,3.2732,0.1751,0.2181,0.7099,3.4461,1.9272,5.3702,0.2162,5.6337,5.5369,4.5529,4.6161,0.0273,1.7034,3.8742,1.1152,1.475,0.6317,1.1206,0.1813,2.1054,1.7213,0.1603,2.435,1.2065,4.1831,2.9975,3.2237,5.0999,0.6716,2.3157,0.4774,1.69,1.1634,1.2158,4.831,0.8754,0.5279,0.9389,2.7723,1.6444,0.3763,2.5,0.5504,1.2742,4.8822,0.6207,5.2081,2.2647,2.1017,2.3275,0.81,0.2524,7.6179,0.9028,2.843,2.667,6.2746,0.1447,4.2266,1.7716,4.0946,0.7633,4.5702,6.2325,5.6737,4.4946,4.2547,3.1743,5.4443,0.1823,0.7357,4.7914,0.2381,6.132,0.0123,0.2595,8.1936,0.2132,1.0958,1.9144,5.3287,1.8719,0.0007,0.4174,3.0171,3.9443,1.4664,2.8064,3.9283,1.713,5.0339,0.0006,2.4247,4.8261,5.9164,2.3093,0.4937,3.107,6.6404,3.4391,0.0198,2.4929,3.201,0.9163,1.8293,1.8688,1.1296,5.3855,3.4418,5.6794,0.1871,2.1246,3.1607,1.082,1.3926,6.088,3.1712,0.7148,0.6416,3.213,3.0338,2.5987,2.7107,5.3494,4.2341,5.1883,0.002,0.5877,2.868,1.3064,1.2873,0.009,2.0326,2.9946,3.0225,0.6974,1.0446,6.452,2.1316,1.3449,7.2072,0.9369,2.7538,3.154,3.5164,2.9136,1.0684,1.4157,0.0644,0.2032,0.2702,0.1822,2.4377,6.0664,0.8162,2.9917,0.5975,2.4536,5.0443,2.6395,1.7196,0.15,2.8416,1.4883,0.6579,2.7016,1.7425,1.7748,3.7958,1.0863,4.031,1.9653,2.9027,0.3747,1.2342,0.2394,1.2769,0.5246,0.0925,3.5447,1.9187,2.8157,6.8855,2.7577,0.0542,0.039,0.6449,5.0474,2.6779,1.7567,1.9206,4.2088,2.6836,4.0848,3.5001,1.8163,1.7214,2.1324,2.5891,0.122,2.5201,2.2758,6.1628,0.2428,6.9145,0.2572,1.1445,3.3583,1.0892,0.0515,7.2912,0.4875,1.1357,3.9761,0.3824,6.0396,2.2249,2.0563,0.0357,4.3054,0.7733,5.4633,0.0521,1.1752]}

{"prompt":"A Lesbian couple have been living in a Fallout shelter for the past 20 years . One of them gets pregnant . How ?","text":"A Lesbian couple have been living in a Fallout shelter for the past 20 years. One of them gets pregnant. How? Maybe by a Fallout virus or a Fallout bug. In any case she\u2019s going to have a child \u2026\u2026 And this is NOT a movie.\nI thought that I was the only one that thought that movie was funny.. Not all fallout movies I watch have to be serious.. That is why they should have made a stand alone movie about the story of a Fallout.\nThis is not going to be a comedy.. it is about the couple. I guess it could have been comedy, but the humour is a little far fetched, and is quite unnatural.\nMy favorite of the whole lot is the second one. They do it a little differently with the language but the message is the same.\nBUT I do have to agree with you about what happened after. Maybe they could have kept a little of the humour going\nThis film was so, so funny I laughed out loud over 40 times, if you believe this then you should really get this. Also the film was so good a comedy that I had fun watching it.\nThis is a really funny movie about a lesbian couple living in the ruins of nuclear war. Even though it\u2019s based on a book it kind of has it\u2019s own personality.\nAll the funny lines were true so this is a really fun comedy that has a great cast and I don\u2019t know a lesbian couple that doesn\u2019t want to see this. It\u2019s a fun short film and worth the money you pay.\nI have to admit that this film was a little too short. There were so many things that could have been said about the lesbian couple. The idea was a superb one, even by the time they got pregnant, it had more or less lost its charm. However, I think that the end is worth it, even if no one laughs at it, it\u2019s still humorous.","token_len":407,"entropy":[12.7371,6.4421,3.6901,1.4966,4.1053,1.2819,1.7523,13.7739,2.8904,0.864,2.2999,0.2384,4.171,0.0722,0.7981,4.2722,0.685,1.27,7.1726,3.9617,2.6413,6.5153,4.1161,6.9622,3.2737,3.6994,7.641,4.7395,3.2194,2.0373,3.2908,3.7944,0.5251,4.6216,2.2788,0.0938,6.3576,16.67,8.5353,0.3999,3.1973,0.1811,1.7448,1.5345,4.6686,8.1527,6.1084,5.3401,3.7861,0.9588,5.5267,1.584,5.9202,0.8881,1.8076,8.0796,4.8275,2.4948,3.348,1.3534,4.421,0.8702,0.4956,2.7187,2.145,1.3102,6.9675,0.7172,4.1564,7.0769,5.6587,5.2901,11.3713,2.0921,6.9101,3.3268,2.5486,3.7686,0.4389,6.521,5.0911,4.7989,2.4901,2.3332,3.366,3.9446,2.5782,4.8039,1.503,6.502,3.304,0.7914,3.4185,2.2013,4.6959,0.9816,2.1232,4.5565,4.6341,1.5574,3.4521,1.1625,1.8514,4.4971,0.0363,0.6728,1.0032,4.9974,4.1065,3.8635,0.6296,3.0713,1.9745,6.6443,2.2731,3.0596,4.8503,2.1007,3.3503,2.1929,0.242,6.1984,2.7185,0.6912,3.1374,7.3419,1.2212,4.1405,2.2979,6.0858,1.2485,0.0001,3.0268,1.8025,4.278,5.2217,8.8416,0.8603,1.1209,4.978,3.4005,4.2843,0.7225,4.407,4.6106,0.8746,1.4916,5.3408,2.5885,1.1845,5.282,3.9732,3.58,4.2147,1.0548,1.4156,4.3058,1.3089,8.5027,4.3246,2.1246,5.1588,0.3622,2.1026,0.0152,0.5782,0.9358,9.4132,3.1801,3.4844,2.9933,0.9427,3.7042,0.5495,2.1158,3.0392,3.3557,3.7102,4.1878,3.3591,6.1161,2.8208,4.2226,0.1677,4.0805,2.9213,2.8863,4.6529,0.8876,3.817,4.8491,6.7957,4.2059,4.8064,2.3348,3.8373,6.3247,0.2346,2.0846,3.994,7.0108,2.6004,0.0012,5.8669,7.7336,0.9249,3.0303,5.5145,1.4675,4.8769,3.7352,7.1114,1.0192,2.5765,5.1625,3.7515,3.0348,2.4778,5.7113,2.6656,4.7052,1.8829,1.5739,2.9262,6.2324,6.5045,2.2506,1.1455,3.6574,5.9363,1.8862,0.5763,1.2358,1.0088,2.917,1.3415,1.9278,3.6966,2.4961,0.9241,3.8061,0.7779,4.7754,0.0601,2.2726,0.2331,2.3672,5.7408,0.0519,7.2174,1.8489,0.5718,6.1059,0.8545,1.572,7.7867,0.6712,0.0504,5.2802,0.1576,0.9957,3.4145,4.0822,8.1288,0.0143,3.3131,3.8564,5.101,0.3597,0.2414,4.1333,5.6272,0.8803,1.1405,5.7581,1.5447,5.0464,4.9901,2.7106,5.8719,6.2514,3.9581,1.2837,1.6589,2.0687,3.3421,5.0778,2.8034,3.3013,1.7057,3.0439,3.2637,1.7333,3.7241,4.1089,0.4973,0.3084,0.2998,1.7055,5.4632,5.5161,2.113,1.3434,2.5635,0.0225,0.0862,0.3655,3.4883,0.1977,3.5839,1.8076,1.8809,3.2799,1.1833,0.043,0.0164,1.7261,3.5951,7.0648,1.4415,2.0161,6.1,3.0544,1.399,3.2558,2.5271,1.8408,0.5598,1.838,3.1349,1.7458,2.1081,1.2556,1.7167,3.1065,1.47,1.8062,1.1731,2.4126,3.6636,1.8101,3.9001,1.1329,2.569,0.0359,2.9094,1.3344,2.5343,0.2668,0.4686,2.5725,1.2651,1.3255,6.2583,0.1326,1.823,2.5814,5.7629,2.5571,4.2562,12.6092,2.381,1.7563,4.5141,4.4978,1.0854,3.3877,2.4368,2.3206,4.3499,2.172,1.9651,2.9428,5.0888,3.4522,0.0057,4.423,0.5315,1.7833,0.3992,4.2901,0.7027,2.0652,1.8466,1.5027,1.8286,5.58,3.6216,4.0602,1.3041,2.2997,3.5478,0.4686,6.239,0.2747,6.1992,1.4552,0.7157,3.4572,1.8972,2.3307,0.0477,0.0202,2.1935,8.0248,0.6561]}

He has had thousands of incarnations, throughout history and in each one he is a world-class prodigy in anything he truly sets his mind to and practices with faith in his heart. Christ needs no teachers, he leads by example. He needs no preachers, he says what is on his mind and teaches others what he knows. He is the perfect man ; not perfect in appearance, but perfect in spirit. No matter what the world may make of him or what people may have made of him, Jesus is truly the perfect person.\nIn Christ there is the perfectness of the Father. He is our high priest and mediator between us and God. Through his crucified body he gives us the forgiveness of sins. Through his resurrected body he gives us his authority and life in perfect purity. No matter what happens to us in this life \u2013 it is our privilege to have the perfection of the Father in our lives. There is no flaw in his character and there is never any sinful nature left in Jesus.\nAs a result, we have freedom through Christ to do what we will and go where we will. No one or anything can stop us. We have eternal life and we are free of condemnation. If you want to save yourself, you can and there are no excuses ; except that you have never thought about it. The only reason why you are struggling so much to change is because you think that you don\u2019t deserve it. The problem is that we\u2019ve never really realized how much we are worthy of it.\nJesus Christ is the only one who was allowed freedom to free us. He was granted permission to take away our chains that were designed to keep us captive to sin, but we have chosen to disobey him. We never believed what he said about the end for sinners to come. We\u2019ve kept it in the back of our minds because we never got that important message from God\u2019s Son.","token_len":408,"entropy":[7.8341,3.2707,1.5303,4.6506,7.8323,1.4883,0.7649,7.7904,4.8357,5.7623,0.9513,1.3186,1.453,2.7319,5.218,5.4007,0.0729,2.9513,0.0806,1.1021,8.3193,1.2055,1.9989,2.2436,4.8446,3.6856,2.3784,3.3918,3.2616,6.4549,0.6972,1.4316,7.9609,0.2261,2.8943,7.5332,0.9284,10.1645,6.1701,1.4015,1.3431,0.0306,4.1295,7.5689,5.361,5.5017,2.5696,3.1257,4.1869,0.5178,5.6076,7.5319,1.8021,6.7837,1.0494,2.8764,8.0278,3.1005,0.1818,2.362,1.1013,3.9124,1.7354,6.6146,0.0265,0.7288,0.4012,6.1751,5.1342,2.3126,4.69,0.2454,0.1748,1.3634,3.8721,3.1234,1.3014,0.7854,2.8356,0.6457,1.1772,1.4965,1.5066,3.9832,3.859,10.4937,4.3854,6.0175,2.1107,4.7968,0.5581,0.6364,0.697,0.1145,2.7099,0.4931,4.8894,2.9542,0.8747,2.8242,2.5915,1.5066,4.9083,0.6246,0.6253,3.1669,1.5633,3.8356,1.3265,4.9098,4.6052,0.0759,0.033,0.2488,4.1747,2.1535,5.11,0.7558,2.676,3.4349,0.7699,1.6688,6.1517,4.4778,3.7425,0.5706,3.992,4.5598,4.2646,0.1969,1.9755,3.5413,1.9107,1.8613,0.68,4.377,8.3842,0.3752,1.4777,4.2647,0.0014,2.6647,1.4281,0.3607,1.6207,0.5733,5.0401,2.5337,6.4868,0.1786,1.3155,1.6784,4.0995,1.2108,1.295,6.2973,0.2937,0.8964,2.0518,1.0368,0.3189,5.2868,1.3305,0.4207,1.242,0.0849,4.8557,6.3298,1.8321,4.4613,3.599,7.7886,3.5161,0.4333,5.3964,1.2164,0.4587,4.1774,0.5947,1.2301,1.6245,2.3851,0.6538,7.7943,5.0492,0.5829,2.0659,7.023,0.5243,3.4433,2.2066,7.6194,0.3464,1.7983,0.4764,1.655,1.4939,1.2094,0.6009,4.3805,0.2772,0.5939,8.0285,0.2701,1.9698,3.0249,2.8158,3.0204,0.1468,5.4639,0.5437,8.6243,3.8991,7.7947,0.6707,6.6301,1.4183,1.631,4.1098,1.9844,2.6843,1.5005,2.0616,2.2133,6.7168,5.9407,1.1162,1.6723,2.7972,0.8446,0.6792,4.0127,2.3694,6.0367,1.0029,0.1822,0.9756,0.7899,3.889,1.7782,5.9441,2.0682,1.5309,2.9867,0.1439,1.3971,1.9977,1.8143,5.7767,0.2538,1.5024,1.6471,1.5017,1.9661,2.9747,6.9589,0.7472,3.7962,2.5642,2.11,0.2457,4.7582,1.646,1.3395,1.6244,1.6599,5.1741,6.6898,0.9668,2.5572,3.3739,7.3461,7.4877,2.0484,0.803,2.1287,5.5739,5.9016,2.0851,1.7692,1.087,3.2929,1.6364,2.6327,2.4257,0.8712,2.095,7.0675,4.1333,0.8169,3.3211,5.3809,0.857,0.2804,0.6171,3.6753,1.5046,1.4198,4.1818,16.8855,7.8032,0.9224,4.4341,1.2437,0.4891,3.1233,4.552,0.5646,0.8154,3.8297,8.2698,0.1566,1.8816,2.1939,3.6087,3.9097,1.7728,1.2873,1.1566,1.8243,6.0298,0.4044,2.6402,0.4437,1.7168,3.3567,2.2249,0.9742,1.0332,2.2681,1.8994,0.4481,4.8088,6.4389,6.9889,2.1936,5.3638,1.5483,2.0501,1.3165,1.4924,3.9455,5.9383,0.3509,4.0914,3.4507,0.9091,7.2071,4.6964,2.726,5.876,0.2852,1.2088,0.1076,6.6306,1.7718,2.5804,2.3812,2.6737,2.7014,2.6546,5.8631,0.3313,4.2005,0.0009,1.2664,0.8751,1.2834,6.0478,4.1425,4.7811,0.6365,0.8283,3.0472,2.5509,5.7906,5.6983,4.9197,5.3506,0.3887,0.9726,0.9126,7.4093,0.0797,0.2068,4.8691,4.0545,2.3948,2.173,3.4704,0.0892,0.0171,0.3173,2.9249,0.7814,4.1097,5.4968,3.6967,8.3842,1.3505,1.7791,1.9292,4.8769,0.0401,5.3778,3.0544,0.6519]}
{"prompt":"The orbit around Earth suddenly fills with thousands of alien ships . Turns out the moon has just been made a stop in a galactic game similar to Pokemon Go .","text":"The orbit around Earth suddenly fills with thousands of alien ships. Turns out the moon has just been made a stop in a galactic game similar to Pokemon Go. Here are the stories that have taken place on the Moon.\nThe moon is not all we have left with our planet. With all the damage done by humans over the centuries, what can we make for it? The question is being answered in a variety of ways. In some cases simply making a little repair and then turn it into a tourist site. In other cases, it could be turned into a military base or a new city to create new life forms.\nIn all cases, the question of \u200b\u200bwho the aliens will be remains open. Some think that they have come to save Earth and others expect them to destroy it. A couple of researchers have tried to find out what is behind the disappearance of the moon. The main thesis is that the moon has simply been pushed aside and made a stop on the route. It turns out that the way to the moon does not stop but continues with a detour by Mars.\nOne of the main reasons that have led to the current state is the constant human action over the years. In the case of Mars at least there is not much evidence that something has been done there or if anything has been created. On the other hand, the current situation with the moon makes you wonder why it suddenly had to turn a corner.\nIt is worth noting that this does not necessarily mean that the moon will become a habitable place on Earth. It remains to be seen if enough oxygen is provided to make life worth having. The surface of the Moon is essentially made of oxidized iron at the moment. It is believed that humans will be able to find a suitable place on the moon for a long time.\nIn fact, the current state of the moon may turn out to be favorable for life. In this case, the current situation will allow for a new world to be built without much effort because it will already be there.","token_len":408,"entropy":[11.4787,5.3772,2.2117,9.3359,8.8897,1.4168,5.9371,0.0628,6.9826,4.1612,1.6483,9.6807,0.0094,2.2284,5.2958,2.7511,4.4343,1.9895,5.1206,2.5308,7.5695,4.1946,3.0611,4.3046,5.4523,9.1956,0.0753,6.6759,0.5339,0.5438,5.2748,2.0241,1.6915,5.2331,2.6666,1.8369,3.5093,0.5586,3.0635,0.9868,2.3666,1.6064,0.4521,7.4909,4.0217,1.1864,3.4162,5.5582,6.5131,2.0237,3.1059,5.7799,3.9998,3.1174,0.596,5.4963,3.3276,0.8666,7.0212,0.9753,1.4956,4.359,3.5641,0.1268,2.8903,0.3286,4.6516,3.1763,0.5182,5.0759,6.3727,2.8632,1.5714,2.5582,4.5348,0.8809,6.2775,2.6738,1.9882,2.1382,5.7447,0.0011,0.4347,0.7308,3.5389,3.4839,0.9798,7.0508,3.576,1.937,3.964,8.8362,3.2314,3.2156,9.4917,1.9056,1.8023,0.7415,5.5061,5.0855,1.722,0.9502,0.8773,0.2601,1.1756,4.0021,1.6064,0.3668,6.3483,0.046,0.3958,4.553,0.561,1.8788,1.515,4.6483,3.1586,3.2054,4.3457,2.609,3.5569,3.2993,0.4653,1.5416,2.9387,3.5818,1.6372,0.3962,1.787,4.5787,1.82,11.2731,0.6116,6.4778,4.4873,2.303,3.5109,0.2403,4.6228,3.6481,0.7361,3.6132,5.0881,1.5028,1.7882,3.52,3.6447,0.6454,4.1188,2.4791,2.1955,3.2783,7.8954,1.2412,0.0317,3.1993,1.0376,0.713,4.7438,4.452,0.4598,5.8249,1.3775,4.188,0.3739,2.8619,0.3155,2.4329,3.4368,2.876,0.6832,5.8066,0.1696,0.7557,1.1872,0.7672,2.6149,5.0061,5.7173,0.7439,0.1108,1.055,2.1431,1.8004,5.3003,0.6389,6.3721,3.9799,1.8766,4.7105,0.8919,1.1664,4.1807,1.7405,6.4784,2.6302,3.0767,4.3044,0.0053,0.3537,1.1313,6.9515,1.9917,3.3962,1.397,5.8067,0.1572,4.34,5.4741,5.062,4.5653,1.7332,6.1533,0.0149,5.3628,5.9389,0.721,1.2271,4.228,0.9721,0.1519,3.0796,2.499,1.7789,8.0023,1.8845,0.506,0.6183,5.8224,3.5816,5.0742,1.5552,5.5184,5.5547,6.1073,3.8401,0.7417,1.4221,0.3429,2.7666,1.2335,3.7088,0.0196,2.9642,6.3041,1.1518,4.6779,1.5266,4.1218,1.0023,4.0544,1.1187,5.3722,1.8533,2.105,1.0874,5.0043,4.0623,3.6883,2.9867,0.9469,1.2668,6.3701,1.8577,4.748,0.4306,0.1673,0.0252,0.3105,1.7904,5.0022,1.9747,3.3887,0.7163,0.9523,3.1469,6.312,0.5683,2.8745,2.2904,4.672,5.0398,0.6996,4.8464,3.8342,0.9503,0.8648,1.5353,3.4289,0.9907,3.8801,0.8492,0.1349,3.1426,4.591,0.0612,3.1941,0.1635,0.124,0.802,1.0345,2.8151,4.3733,0.725,8.1471,2.0871,3.6234,1.2543,0.4078,1.8091,7.4143,1.471,0.0074,0.0114,0.9617,7.7792,8.5054,1.6635,4.7227,1.2017,2.2991,3.4158,5.65,8.0766,1.5706,2.4859,5.9281,0.6608,0.4684,2.2007,0.9972,5.8995,3.7777,0.6091,8.55,0.3348,3.6233,5.9896,1.3521,4.4618,1.4316,2.3865,0.8045,3.4477,0.1549,4.9951,3.4233,2.1421,1.0936,0.0133,4.15,2.0496,2.7324,1.5464,2.387,0.7251,2.0669,1.9738,2.3318,2.2457,0.194,1.0361,1.0908,3.0987,3.17,0.2497,1.7528,4.206,1.7709,0.1402,0.4172,1.1044,3.1301,4.4485,0.1183,0.059,0.0972,7.8043,0.7629,3.1869,1.1097,2.9558,3.5603,0.9193,0.6166,1.5353,4.6562,1.6498,2.9879,3.3318,1.9879,1.4771,3.2428,4.0641,1.5423,1.1864,2.8028,6.0896,4.391,3.0479,6.1314,2.252,1.1911,6.5684,0.6905,3.2479,1.3813]}
{"prompt":"A Jedi and a Sith fall in love , without knowing of the other 's affiliation .","text":"A Jedi and a Sith fall in love, without knowing of the other's affiliation. There is also the conflict between the Sith who have not abandoned their dark side and the Jedi who are still bound to the light side. It is also interesting to note that the Sith were not born on Alderaan. They were born thousands of YEARS AGO on Coruscant as a result of an experiment by a member of the Sith Council, which resulted in the creation of the most powerful Sith. Their existence was not known to the Jedi Council until the Jedi were destroyed.\nThe Alliance has changed and will continue to change over the course of the game. However their origin was that they grew out of an uprising and were aided and covertly funded by the Jedi. The Alliance has no control over the Jedi and only indirectly, if at all, control over the Sith. Their only direct control is of their planets ( though their control may be limited by the Sith ) and the Jedi have little control over the Sith either.\nSith and Jedi are each given a rank depending on how far they have ascended to that light or dark side. The rank is given on their character sheet, along with special abilities which they may have ( though not always ) and how strong or weak they are in each aspect. The Sith are at the top of the ladder in the Dark Side with the most powerful ( and strongest ) powers. The Jedi are at the top of the light side ladder with powerful powers and are the strongest ( and heaviest ) in that regard. At the bottom of the ladder is the Wookiee, though it is unknown how strong or weak they are ( though they are not described as terrible - though it is unknown how weak they may be as they have not been seen in battle ).\nAnakin Skywalker is at the peak of his dark side power and is the strongest Jedi and the strongest Sith. It is unknown whether Luke Skywalker is strong in the light or dark side or whether he has a balance which is strong in either.","token_len":408,"entropy":[11.8047,3.6753,1.4193,1.5187,8.4452,1.4987,0.9943,1.5882,7.4995,2.7263,5.7419,1.5971,2.1271,0.6903,6.326,0.8301,5.2163,1.178,2.5326,1.881,5.8619,0.7678,1.1085,3.0404,4.3011,2.6711,4.6357,6.5755,0.6027,4.9951,0.2295,0.7384,0.3837,1.0465,0.3081,1.8476,2.0205,5.6523,0.8458,1.4265,2.0582,1.585,0.727,3.4326,0.5823,2.6334,3.5952,0.4051,0.4157,0.1886,1.2882,2.6543,3.9856,1.957,4.5059,3.8586,6.307,0.0219,0.0001,1.7478,1.8536,1.0908,1.017,7.7275,0.0578,12.8994,0.0236,4.4641,0.158,3.2179,5.038,0.0006,0.0009,4.9009,2.2201,2.0233,0.0021,3.8121,4.1474,1.9817,2.7872,4.9426,0.0213,0.2632,1.9561,2.3945,2.1794,2.5874,2.5472,0.0139,0.8301,2.3487,0.0166,0.8524,6.4583,0.9666,1.7774,3.6379,4.5895,3.8721,1.7568,2.6817,3.2403,1.3482,0.5384,2.0153,4.6284,0.8679,1.2208,3.5211,2.9188,5.4089,2.6333,1.2237,6.2752,7.0959,2.9331,6.5455,3.8267,4.262,1.8382,0.1148,0.323,3.3431,0.6226,1.0388,0.0007,0.3701,3.4546,0.5335,3.9576,6.3281,6.6044,3.8967,6.0003,3.5472,5.9773,3.7944,0.0159,2.8183,5.1142,3.5087,2.4596,6.5678,2.5658,10.6518,0.0044,4.2359,0.0387,0.4856,2.1629,1.6841,1.5047,1.2326,1.7546,4.1803,3.7597,0.0841,0.7771,3.6356,1.7961,4.1865,5.9523,3.6207,4.3139,0.6205,0.0038,0.3791,2.328,0.3657,0.6505,3.2108,0.3741,3.8011,3.5991,5.1048,1.3597,0.8821,3.658,2.5989,9.644,5.4,11.8778,3.7919,4.0973,3.7359,0.9455,1.6169,1.3008,1.1318,4.0065,3.6024,0.6504,2.0192,3.623,2.5258,3.8477,1.4617,0.1739,0.8732,3.1558,3.7967,0.263,1.4527,5.3035,0.657,3.604,1.2598,1.8475,6.6064,4.301,1.4062,5.5417,3.9493,0.09,2.1684,3.4179,0.4072,1.4451,5.2143,1.6088,3.0949,7.0591,4.3844,0.6492,0.0451,0.3738,1.5638,3.6777,2.8267,2.8332,4.1041,3.201,3.9325,0.846,1.613,4.0912,0.004,6.0412,1.654,4.0986,2.2483,2.8779,1.3954,4.3117,6.1965,2.4139,2.6088,2.7488,1.7538,3.5037,3.9047,2.6824,0.3412,0.4615,0.3529,2.8889,5.2009,3.5241,0.9897,1.6297,2.1083,1.1663,5.7559,0.9673,0.9683,0.4572,0.5724,4.4297,3.0364,2.1882,4.9555,0.1455,5.4963,1.1825,2.4744,1.0111,4.5447,2.955,4.1886,1.823,3.3986,1.2049,0.9607,1.0818,0.5532,0.6908,0.0427,3.0115,0.3988,0.0682,5.5271,0.2396,7.4546,0.3101,6.1395,1.9299,2.0874,2.9746,2.5874,2.8437,2.4898,0.4196,7.1595,0.3395,1.2029,4.539,4.5441,0.2242,5.7069,0.1934,1.2034,0.3394,0.0976,0.9802,1.6679,0.4817,8.3627,0.8922,0.1739,1.8873,5.4978,3.6461,0.5013,2.2445,1.7868,3.6966,1.9712,0.1943,1.4523,0.1424,4.102,2.2794,1.4524,1.1933,2.5531,6.9232,0.8139,8.47,5.966,4.1061,2.8873,0.5193,2.5821,0.4232,2.8972,1.18,4.5435,0.2893,4.8869,1.7847,2.5974,2.7314,0.9256,3.1958,1.5143,4.4937,3.6053,0.9169,5.4505,4.9208,0.6603,1.3694,4.8815,0.0824,7.2744,0.056,0.5787,2.9184,0.0536,1.0553,1.7465,1.4728,1.7579,2.3847,1.2769,3.7919,1.5975,1.9343,1.9695,1.1093,4.2759,0.2432,1.357,2.4354,5.7365,0.5976,0.8826,4.2694,3.3233,1.3351,3.2871,0.763,0.8075,0.0611,2.8434,1.8123,0.2668,2.9114,2.5643,8.7017,4.9578,1.1089,5.1609,1.3663,3.0963,1.4242]}

{"prompt":"The Pet Merchant","text":"The Pet Merchant\u2019s Tale in the form of a graphic novel was written by Jeff McAllister. The story is well explained in the graphic novel, though more would be helpful. It\u2019s a great book for middle schoolers and high schoolers. You will understand why Jeff McAllister won the 2007 ALA Book Award for the Juvenile Nonfiction Book of the Year, the 2008 ALA Best Book Award for Children\u2019s Nonfiction, and the 2009 Caldecott Medal. It wasn\u2019t too difficult to read the story at this level, but you should not expect it to be simple.\nThis is a story about real pet sellers who have to compete with other sellers, but not to the point where they have to compete with the big pet stores for business. The authors and illustrators draw attention to the fact that pet sellers don\u2019t necessarily have a lot of money. When the author and illustrator describe the owner\u2019s personal experience with the pet selling business, you get a better idea about what goes into the job. It is heart wrenching sometimes when they can\u2019t afford to feed and take care of the dogs or other pets sold. It would be easy to give up on life. One owner tells us:\nThat is the problem with the business. The income is very minimal. The dogs are expensive to feed and have to be taken to the breeder for a regular health check. When things go wrong, sometimes, it\u2019s just easier to give up the business. I can afford to do better things with my life. I can go home and write. I can do the painting. I\u2019m going to have the time to put in these stories.\nAs you read this book, you can picture the scene of the pet shop the author and illustrator have created. You can imagine the atmosphere just like they have described it, and you can appreciate what has to pass by the thought of a pet seller in this world.","token_len":409,"entropy":[9.9471,11.8887,10.0185,9.7715,4.8785,7.6703,4.8533,1.9628,6.8632,0.0104,1.3875,7.6122,0.1385,3.9757,4.4094,0.5662,5.9462,6.2412,4.1668,0.0106,1.6509,1.7487,1.8269,1.9902,6.7145,6.7955,2.4275,0.6344,5.2798,0.0525,1.4709,4.7105,6.2394,6.2977,0.6533,5.7445,2.0044,3.1653,12.1021,1.0349,0.0045,1.8462,4.6046,3.7028,2.4412,7.6781,0.5522,1.2051,1.797,2.9785,0.0498,1.1785,1.5746,4.6436,2.0465,4.5059,1.6934,4.1143,0.9607,0.0032,0.0013,6.8789,1.3556,6.3412,6.9092,2.5816,4.1859,0.573,0.5627,2.938,9.4125,0.0111,6.0742,0.2087,3.7661,0.8728,0.0817,0.0263,2.3155,3.4313,3.8898,0.5676,0.0112,3.4373,2.9993,0.9783,0.6248,3.2799,4.7682,0.1601,0.1595,6.0649,0.036,1.1497,0.5098,0.489,1.7874,9.899,0.1703,0.0005,1.7042,2.0593,2.2204,7.2483,0.2487,0.7015,0.395,5.318,2.966,0.4817,1.8395,2.3519,1.6326,4.3812,3.5104,3.1173,1.3846,1.4291,2.9758,3.1235,3.3817,3.0375,1.9045,0.1684,0.6244,5.6073,0.941,2.343,6.8783,1.3165,1.2962,3.1505,0.9191,7.0048,7.0432,5.6953,2.1457,3.0803,3.9709,4.4406,0.5575,3.1223,1.8263,2.9776,2.9715,4.1752,3.2751,1.7802,0.744,0.8454,0.9374,2.5402,0.1228,1.498,0.2715,2.3831,4.5757,3.6632,3.2294,4.8207,4.9812,0.2345,1.7903,4.8961,4.4177,1.6397,0.0497,5.7911,3.6889,0.0899,0.7635,1.7901,0.0259,2.7005,1.4768,3.5821,0.1904,0.3093,0.0815,4.2209,1.3592,2.6572,2.8022,0.2407,1.2285,1.6414,4.7228,2.3506,4.2501,2.3883,0.1579,0.0242,8.1651,1.4249,6.579,2.7051,0.0189,0.024,4.4863,3.631,1.6632,1.7875,0.4907,6.3435,1.6897,0.2931,2.9093,3.3869,0.9403,4.3754,1.5394,3.6553,1.7608,5.1286,0.9571,1.4167,5.0389,0.377,2.7534,1.4043,7.8843,4.2243,0.0081,6.957,2.9217,5.4488,4.8567,2.4385,0.0602,0.0049,3.7146,0.6049,6.4075,3.0112,5.3783,0.1533,0.0107,1.1199,4.9244,2.6812,4.5448,1.0292,6.639,1.4193,2.6342,5.2052,0.4882,3.712,0.3189,4.3953,1.4193,1.1597,7.7463,4.0514,5.7197,6.3422,5.6175,2.6115,3.5089,0.8914,5.7864,2.8238,2.2356,3.7294,1.2557,1.7268,2.7001,0.853,2.0235,8.1559,1.6659,3.3647,5.3064,0.6946,1.5066,4.4312,0.9505,5.0288,2.5015,1.0839,1.2118,4.7701,1.1325,0.9655,2.2534,4.4245,0.9803,6.4141,0.0013,2.8908,3.1897,4.7846,7.0554,0.1238,0.9349,3.8525,6.8933,1.5186,0.6449,0.5477,5.0195,3.9546,2.7863,3.126,0.038,0.0056,3.1547,5.8817,0.3254,3.6764,0.1486,3.4782,0.8771,0.7401,2.6594,3.551,4.5413,0.5616,3.0759,5.0795,3.3453,2.0678,0.5121,1.7866,0.6564,1.846,1.6853,3.4907,3.9242,0.8008,6.3031,2.8556,0.6474,0.2317,2.6507,3.3625,7.1537,0.9968,0.5246,5.7809,0.0461,0.7038,2.7658,0.0874,2.4194,3.0045,3.4896,0.7219,4.1043,2.723,6.9021,8.1933,0.6212,1.3781,4.5679,2.75,1.3881,1.6546,2.6744,0.2934,0.505,3.5194,6.6827,1.5151,6.1373,2.2145,1.4982,2.3581,2.4891,6.6765,2.2374,1.0058,0.1358,0.0095,3.4714,1.9035,0.6111,3.0736,1.1164,2.5161,0.939,5.6757,7.5217,2.3968,3.3143,1.8017,4.4057,0.8975,2.8023,1.8688,1.6161,0.4997,4.6348,3.5702,5.2701,3.8123,7.8871,5.7676,3.4394,7.5677,1.3226,2.0623,1.3664,2.7351,3.145,3.258,2.1096,0.4259]}

And just when you think you can get back to your normal life after finding a cure to cancer... your sister gets taken away. Soon after that her friend dies too. You find yourself lost in the darkness of cyber space.\n'It's not a good thing to be an only child,'your granny says again. She shakes her head, sadly considering. 'But you can't choose your family. You know who you are, don't you?'Her words ring through your head like a megaphone. Even in the darkest part of the world, you know you have a home you always have.\n'This one is from Russia.' The Russian lawyer was speaking. His dark brown hair and skinned features suggested a deep connection to nature. 'Here are the documents she signed.'\nBut as we approach that fateful day, we still must deal with the day-to-day, the routine, the routine of life.\nSometimes we must not be the only one... but then we realize that there is no one.

But they don\u2019t attack each other. The armies stand apart, in complete peace.\nYou read that right ; the 7\u20194\u2033 hulk is not defending against the little girl because both are not aggressive. Each man is defending himself. Why?\nOur minds are powerful engines that keep us safe. When we were young, we went outside on a snowy day to play with our friends. Suddenly a heavy storm came and started pouring down snow. As the snow melted, we were very hungry.\n\u201c Why don\u2019t we go up to the barn and get some milk?\u201d our mother says to us, \u201c We are very hungry and thirsty! \u201d The children replied in one voice.\n\u201c You know what, I saw a tiny mouse in the middle of the snow melt. Let\u2019s go bring it to the barn!\u201d\nWe heard an interesting sound in the barn. A mouse was running up the beam. \u201cThat is a bad idea \u201d we said.\nWe were going inside and were leaving some milk in the kitchen. \u201c Go help the neighbors to get theirs!\u201d our mother said.\nLater when we were on our way home with our milk, we looked back and saw it had snowed in the barn. In fact the snow almost covered the little mouse\nThere are many examples of people and animals who react in a way because there is no attack.

But you can now; you can now gofrom this place and go forth into all the world and start afollow your true purpose.","token_len":413,"entropy":[8.8382,3.1027,0.4398,1.942,8.4985,0.1518,4.0337,3.4645,1.7636,11.7199,12.7811,7.9299,3.2254,1.818,3.7946,9.2865,3.3713,6.6026,0.896,2.6768,4.197,6.143,1.7554,3.6496,5.521,4.0562,1.4844,4.9987,0.762,2.6165,4.1529,0.5548,0.2626,3.0866,3.987,1.3699,7.6516,9.4291,3.5946,2.7041,1.0007,5.0664,1.1726,4.5026,0.3169,3.9122,5.5295,2.0331,5.1761,1.8136,1.2743,2.7704,3.9231,4.072,4.464,1.4503,2.3698,4.0049,1.9145,2.1991,4.9081,3.5455,1.69,6.1054,2.4719,4.1967,4.5362,3.0377,2.5002,1.7227,1.4443,2.9731,6.2422,0.3031,4.9101,9.1016,2.904,0.4642,7.1937,1.6901,4.5651,0.3994,3.2908,2.9014,1.511,2.5938,7.7095,15.5479,5.905,0.6352,1.6551,1.3578,0.0694,2.3784,4.3712,1.4214,5.4455,1.6785,1.1877,4.5105,8.8606,0.0499,7.7593,0.2621,0.0483,1.1738,1.649,3.3261,0.0653,4.5978,1.5178,3.3671,3.6007,3.1188,5.0476,1.1802,5.607,3.769,4.1309,1.1195,3.7397,1.1104,3.6979,6.0345,7.5253,6.4874,4.69,2.5306,0.9327,0.797,2.8164,2.828,2.5847,3.5885,1.9636,0.5475,4.1149,5.1436,2.4289,3.4518,1.0926,1.6948,1.7815,0.7197,0.3684,4.0923,3.0373,1.64,6.122,3.0553,1.9521,8.2474,0.0735,4.8371,0.2175,2.0481,1.1805,6.3245,1.9807,2.094,0.6623,0.6993,1.3003,4.285,0.5423,1.7589,2.325,2.7915,3.3897,0.2593,6.7634,3.4426,3.6652,2.6478,0.8144,5.1258,2.3212,0.5327,3.425,1.0958,3.7466,5.3275,3.8963,2.5759,0.5469,0.6185,4.3835,2.8976,2.4267,2.4135,5.4448,0.9308,0.2094,3.8621,2.6115,0.6063,0.7236,1.0228,1.9236,6.3211,5.0313,1.0497,0.0782,4.2488,4.0746,1.498,3.8552,3.7855,8.7811,1.1922,0.7655,9.5496,2.7703,4.3563,2.327,2.5356,4.2787,4.1088,0.4052,5.1382,7.1671,4.1947,7.1855,0.5296,2.2879,3.9995,4.2396,4.0943,2.2343,4.0242,0.6034,5.8726,0.6442,2.7529,1.9904,2.8468,4.5999,0.49,9.3117,0.6609,1.7891,1.7096,4.3024,7.4849,3.4703,1.4016,1.3819,2.8173,1.3066,2.7014,3.1613,1.1312,5.312,4.8904,0.1196,0.0706,1.255,6.1706,0.1099,6.0885,2.9038,2.4257,2.9965,1.9532,3.0622,2.4191,2.58,4.5932,4.2572,0.8253,6.2421,5.9284,1.865,7.5106,1.6295,3.823,6.1369,0.5141,0.8855,1.6795,5.0717,1.9739,4.475,5.9156,3.6657,1.2644,4.2253,4.1765,0.4927,6.1916,3.5434,3.6842,0.1652,7.442,0.2847,2.6792,4.3203,1.7107,4.4978,11.2132,3.9424,0.9182,0.9765,2.0912,3.4686,6.4563,3.262,2.9924,1.8449,3.0534,2.6398,2.1262,0.4537,0.295,1.7405,0.1699,5.6911,0.7896,0.2595,0.7175,0.0389,3.6636,2.1718,2.598,3.0904,1.7331,1.4671,4.5009,0.1662,0.3007,0.7998,8.1439,1.3458,4.7659,3.2847,2.3451,0.7272,1.5049,4.3565,3.182,4.4582,2.68,1.3684,5.2489,4.7071,2.7081,2.6931,0.7384,3.5601,0.2051,3.0412,2.2276,3.2611,2.5958,7.7997,2.7003,3.7609,4.3621,4.4065,1.1525,3.2894,4.2378,3.2698,1.196,2.895,5.9441,2.4995,4.0266,2.9943,5.791,2.068,0.0571,3.1031,1.8873,2.3069,9.2916,7.38,1.701,3.0251,4.615,1.8198,4.8613,0.0787,4.324,1.1559,3.9758,1.533,4.5594,4.1229,7.4559,1.4791,0.9479,1.7027,4.3605,8.5742,2.9117,2.7625,2.2986,3.9118,5.4826,3.2627,3.6439,0.8659,0.879,2.6657,6.0056,6.0806,10.5722,6.0391,5.9262,2.4018,0.8914]}

The truth is a closely guarded secret, and for good reason. As a newly qualified astronomer, inducted into the field, the truth has been revealed to you. '\nThis morning's paper has a section showing that while Iain Stewart, a professor of theoretical astronomy at Loughborough, claims that we haven't discovered anything new about the universe - that the cosmos has always existed - he is now saying that our understanding 'of the real state of our Universe has been profoundly altered by what we have discovered about dark energy '.\nI thought it was a bit unbelievable when I heard it - being the person that I am, I expect my professor to be some kind of super-scientist. But the claims by this man are well documented at Loughborough - and he's saying that it has revolutionised how we view dark matter and dark energy, because we've been able to take them out of the equation.\nThe paper says :\n'This has resulted in two fundamental revisions of cosmological theory... Now, we have to know the nature of dark energy and dark matter. It turns out we can't solve for dark matter and dark energy simultaneously. Thus the cosmological equations cannot be simultaneously solved. The basic equations are solved at once, and then if the universe is dominated by dark energy, then one of the equations is dominated by dark matter. In other words, one solution is ruled out because it has a different contribution from dark energy compared to one where it is dark energy which dominates the universe '. - Iain Stewart, published in Astronomy Letters, Vol. 37, Issue 3, June 2004.\nThis paper is from Iain's lecture notes on dark energy - I've never seen anyone else claim that it is impossible to understand ( i.e. solve for ) dark matter and dark energy simultaneously.\nWhy is it so difficult?\nI suspect that it's because dark energy is far too complex to understand.","token_len":414,"entropy":[5.2319,2.6914,2.0323,3.4423,1.9074,2.1251,9.0946,1.4463,3.6369,4.4903,1.0609,2.5794,8.8484,0.9612,7.64,0.1327,1.5185,2.7326,7.3602,1.1478,1.9813,4.5076,0.4032,3.9053,11.0446,0.456,0.0675,2.2474,1.3051,4.7233,2.6717,0.0301,0.3386,4.5234,2.3972,8.3953,6.6477,1.7474,0.5766,14.6821,0.1001,0.3384,0.4211,5.7371,1.3935,3.727,3.7122,2.5319,0.986,2.6879,1.5393,3.5898,0.8168,7.9985,3.5108,6.1421,5.9414,3.0496,4.747,3.6143,2.8561,4.9186,6.115,2.9629,5.9635,4.4296,8.55,5.2657,2.1106,2.0779,3.7378,0.3899,5.1706,1.3295,0.248,5.8925,0.7516,0.0044,2.6816,6.373,1.29,3.6885,5.0866,0.0007,3.2598,2.0649,2.9111,1.8148,0.5235,2.1155,5.284,2.3621,2.3069,4.7591,2.4054,4.0766,1.347,1.5206,2.2611,2.4525,4.1558,2.9262,0.3985,3.97,2.869,8.3092,4.6941,0.5313,5.7141,6.8338,0.239,3.0946,2.7857,1.8309,1.1123,5.3882,2.3011,1.0834,4.4157,0.8116,1.1561,2.4377,2.4456,6.5405,2.7673,6.3985,0.9996,3.576,6.497,2.0427,1.2442,1.9036,2.3063,6.3447,3.35,0.6033,2.7903,3.2099,3.6931,7.8017,2.821,5.0391,3.4959,2.6289,0.724,1.3415,0.9084,7.326,3.2186,7.6211,0.5599,1.1501,5.6141,1.013,0.0044,5.3482,1.156,1.9286,0.0031,1.1308,1.6385,3.1665,6.7784,3.4222,3.3636,2.9798,0.9198,6.1159,2.7397,6.1351,3.4113,0.0063,0.0016,2.9845,1.6692,3.1779,2.2943,5.5552,0.8167,3.4213,2.5604,8.2628,0.059,4.2019,0.3474,2.3691,3.5452,1.6633,1.7872,1.4649,0.0754,2.1146,3.6424,2.2474,2.0695,1.6891,1.7576,0.0093,4.5302,3.8244,2.0155,0.304,0.4226,3.808,1.6067,0.9109,2.6101,3.1018,3.4633,6.4074,1.4853,1.3709,3.6827,3.6432,4.8031,0.0456,5.0004,2.994,7.6459,1.082,4.3085,2.4802,0.0702,1.1605,5.4721,6.455,1.3202,2.4405,1.6921,2.5167,5.4024,2.8103,3.0251,0.0824,0.9058,0.346,1.7514,0.3474,0.6541,1.3207,3.1962,4.1884,0.0023,3.4683,1.7952,1.2678,6.3026,5.1034,2.5183,1.0839,2.302,0.1699,0.1366,4.8514,0.9943,5.9379,2.8241,3.5729,0.1012,0.1344,3.739,3.8105,0.8763,7.5575,2.3333,0.8532,2.387,5.4833,3.7782,2.111,6.7459,4.1737,4.575,1.2582,1.3481,3.5268,6.3055,2.4335,4.453,1.1601,7.2369,0.0325,0.4609,1.1727,0.8237,1.1244,5.2209,1.8326,0.5072,3.7536,1.7633,7.4463,0.2554,0.1219,0.2306,0.6854,3.5293,0.6112,0.0017,0.2175,3.6124,5.4164,1.6005,5.2829,0.2502,3.9954,2.5699,3.1397,2.8779,2.3005,7.4463,1.2909,2.4558,0.8163,6.494,0.2164,2.881,5.7553,1.5045,0.9684,5.5024,1.6895,6.2138,2.0468,1.389,2.7108,7.8385,7.4072,4.0925,0.0326,0.0893,1.1497,5.997,0.6875,2.9984,0.1038,2.5034,1.4166,3.8686,0.7081,4.6729,0.2324,2.4033,2.5497,0.4458,3.578,4.0964,1.5084,0.6102,2.9478,2.9145,1.5724,4.1595,5.8181,0.0244,4.0387,4.9343,5.3811,2.6938,2.6991,0.8749,4.1216,4.0714,3.2777,3.7394,1.4663,3.6973,3.0718,3.9634,0.9865,3.2156,1.6076,5.1135,0.7322,2.8469,7.1366,9.0075,0.3176,0.0023,0.3908,6.765,0.3555,5.4353,0.7994,0.2356,0.7053,0.0479,0.3617,0.6625,0.5862,1.5173,4.9092,1.8209,1.8885,1.7241,2.0722,2.6488,1.5079,2.443,5.3045,0.6982,2.3503,1.1672,0.286,2.4586,0.7252,0.8672,5.7142,2.1026,3.3532,0.5462,2.8229,1.433]}
{"prompt":"Kim Jong-un gets a visit from the ghost of Korea past , present and future .","text":"Kim Jong-un gets a visit from the ghost of Korea past, present and future. For the last two days, the most prominent headlines have been Kim Jong-il's death followed by his son and heir, Kim Jong Un\u2019s announcement that he has decided to step down and be succeeded by his senior adviser and friend, Kim Jong Jong, in the final act of defaming his family as \u2018demon families\u2019.\nThe first reaction to this announcement was a mixed response \u2013 some expressing anger that \u2018Kim Jong Nam was killed just because one of his sisters tried to go to the US in search of work\u2019, some calling his brother \u2018a terrible human\u2019 and the world\u2019s media, which he has often criticized for their \u2018hysterically pro-american\u2019 stance, reporting the news in a frenzied rush to report all the stories in a day.\nNot everyone was unhappy though. For those who do recognize the true Kim as the \u2018real Kim\u2019 even this \u2018pro-american\u2019 hysteria has no meaning as they have already accepted this as the outcome of Kim Jong-Un\u2019s policies. If a new regime would follow Kim Jong-Un\u2019s policies, that would also support what the \u2018American and Western media\u2019 (who do actually have an agenda) have been saying about Kim Jong-Il and his government.\nThey would just need a new \u2018fake\u2019 government to justify the \u2018fake\u2019 death of Kim Jong-Il, but they would never dare to put this system into practice. They know they can\u2019t, otherwise the Kim Dynasty and the Korean peninsula will be over. Therefore the only thing that they can do is to make Kim Jong-Un appear to be a martyr. That is why they say, \u2018he sacrificed his life for the nation\u2019, \u2018he was willing to accept death\u2019, he was \u2018doing the right thing\u2019 etc.","token_len":414,"entropy":[9.3302,0.7049,0.7654,7.6043,2.3764,5.2884,0.2638,2.2255,8.8551,0.2523,7.0628,10.0317,3.594,5.2458,0.3158,0.0986,1.2522,5.84,2.0556,3.7457,2.583,2.486,0.663,1.8361,6.2615,4.2579,8.5234,1.4205,0.3132,4.1645,0.1393,0.1158,3.826,0.4045,3.121,7.739,0.0518,1.6249,4.8752,3.6316,3.6628,2.1244,0.4301,0.0226,2.4756,14.2994,8.3612,5.0546,5.6108,1.0183,0.7909,2.3421,3.7973,0.1342,2.9252,0.0379,2.548,4.8918,3.3306,0.0426,0.6678,8.0323,3.9471,2.3851,5.9517,0.9825,0.998,0.2835,6.7473,8.3937,3.1239,2.033,5.8395,6.6943,0.2062,7.18,5.8766,2.4251,3.9538,4.4415,14.9116,5.4211,10.1677,11.3385,1.7163,1.4534,0.7629,1.1813,8.8574,4.0574,5.8526,1.7039,1.7091,2.3057,0.8557,2.6539,4.7626,1.7395,6.309,1.833,4.6632,3.998,2.5233,8.1883,0.1133,1.8553,0.1936,5.4533,2.2928,3.5117,5.7587,3.5971,5.1261,0.346,0.2906,6.644,6.2935,0.0296,5.3167,0.7659,1.3712,5.231,3.7992,3.7936,0.0336,4.6719,4.2527,0.0542,2.0884,2.9624,3.9639,4.7773,5.359,6.0513,0.0283,4.159,6.0039,3.2176,7.0462,0.0308,1.8018,4.3368,4.6779,1.2421,0.0162,2.6204,2.0224,2.87,2.6112,6.9084,2.5397,4.2686,2.4448,1.1647,2.7011,7.7252,0.1345,8.0031,0.2336,5.8835,5.8894,0.2433,8.0226,0.0928,2.7852,0.0895,1.7165,1.5412,6.1513,3.4526,1.4867,3.3705,1.4194,7.2491,0.2306,0.0003,4.932,1.5175,3.2524,5.5846,1.3263,4.376,3.1401,2.5523,3.5643,0.7282,0.6438,6.0271,1.9945,0.9972,5.6856,6.4015,0.7826,4.7408,2.6447,0.6375,3.8219,7.5064,1.1965,4.7025,7.2146,6.022,1.6327,6.5519,0.1807,4.9412,2.898,2.4055,0.0234,8.5471,5.318,5.9597,0.0094,5.5128,1.6126,1.8546,0.006,0.0612,0.0022,10.3751,1.8819,5.2438,4.1375,4.0751,4.0315,2.5016,3.7055,5.8582,2.9772,2.6538,1.9773,5.9303,0.328,4.7572,0.2375,1.7994,3.4741,3.2212,0.0209,0.4766,6.9714,1.3926,5.0117,3.7646,4.2013,1.5721,5.4073,3.6074,3.4135,0.3051,0.6187,1.5501,0.9804,0.0044,0.0068,3.2449,1.0449,3.8781,1.206,4.691,6.4833,5.5367,2.1348,2.9353,0.0231,4.4981,4.1913,2.51,2.9382,3.9878,0.0046,6.1922,3.5773,4.062,6.2138,2.7676,2.7942,2.7994,1.4492,1.3221,1.4852,1.9296,2.484,1.8564,0.2841,0.2665,3.7406,2.0715,0.5218,5.2016,1.8789,0.5739,5.9494,2.8763,5.859,3.1835,3.1817,2.5192,4.6705,0.0161,7.4058,0.9663,0.0462,3.6975,1.2351,4.2401,2.3919,2.1376,0.0088,3.5362,0.2783,0.0076,7.8376,0.4251,0.8668,0.107,0.3142,0.8578,2.7172,3.7286,2.5227,0.8026,4.2717,5.7304,1.008,5.1097,2.952,6.5489,1.3062,1.2973,0.756,3.3931,4.8609,2.9728,2.2497,7.1074,0.8864,0.0508,3.8478,8.0214,2.3575,6.1478,5.2623,3.9678,1.4049,4.5132,4.4733,1.8106,1.7584,5.1531,1.4348,5.3975,3.1645,3.365,2.4159,1.1604,2.0281,1.2341,0.7305,0.4523,1.8773,4.0297,3.7684,0.0776,0.3148,1.3706,5.8174,1.6616,0.2554,1.5887,6.0734,2.0445,4.0503,1.0223,1.5523,0.9812,6.1441,3.2552,1.6105,0.2067,3.6694,8.5146,0.5979,1.0713,1.8426,1.0607,3.9733,0.6767,0.01,1.905,1.5779,0.0296,1.6868,2.6274,5.1894,0.1308,4.5539,3.5632,0.7371,0.0029,1.3612,4.4033,1.5346,4.5945,0.086,7.4927,2.1867,0.5109,0.0461,0.1478,0.0017,7.5352,0.2859]}

{"prompt":"Write a role reversed Power Rangers story where the aliens are the good guys trying to bring Earth into galactic civilization , and the Rangers are soldiers of paranoid , xenophobic governments trying to kill the aliens .","text":"Write a role reversed Power Rangers story where the aliens are the good guys trying to bring Earth into galactic civilization, and the Rangers are soldiers of paranoid, xenophobic governments trying to kill the aliens. That's the original idea, but I always think about it as \" Sleepless In Seattle \" with the aliens as the good guys. And we also have to get rid of an important character from an important story.\nIn my mind I have Zordon as the best role reversed Power Ranger villian ever, I never liked him in my younger years, I think I've been trying to make sense of it ever since - I always thought he deserved as much credit as the Rangers.\nI'm not going to try to explain that. Zordon has one of the first truly \" evil \" villians in modern fiction. And it only took a Ranger to write him up as evil... it takes a person to write evil.\nAt the time I was trying to figure out Zordon and his \" evil \" nature ( I know the story was written by John Stewart, so it shouldn't matter ), I was a very jaded person - I hadn't watched Power Rangers in almost twelve years - and I was so angry with my peers and my world at the time, my anger caused me to put the words in my head together so I could write a story that could make me feel better about my feelings.\nBut here we are almost forty years later and there is still no real idea about why the Rangers are evil. There are plenty of reasons, but there are none that will ever stick with me ( at least not the kind of evil that Zordon does.\nWhen I look back on the original Power Rangers, the original villains are just as evil as Zordon and they're all in black suits with sunglasses ( or with sunglasses at all ). There are even people I remember saying are good in that original series. I've yet to get any reason for them to be good - I can only assume they are because they are in black suits as well.","token_len":414,"entropy":[4.0641,7.8727,13.3959,10.3208,6.8912,6.8199,5.6875,1.9099,8.0047,1.9634,3.4359,5.2548,0.1298,5.0705,0.0222,4.9344,6.7382,5.2751,6.9497,6.073,2.495,1.7555,1.9468,3.4822,1.1253,8.8969,2.1326,13.0391,3.0204,4.8183,0.0617,6.5549,2.438,0.0163,4.3102,1.7569,3.1867,0.7292,5.805,1.0341,1.9714,4.5329,4.2347,1.5283,1.1543,2.9102,5.6578,3.6906,2.8614,1.6642,1.8874,3.6771,12.6451,4.6279,0.1499,3.5063,1.785,1.5649,4.5475,1.2483,3.2861,3.2665,1.0824,2.3616,0.051,1.3702,3.5372,4.8197,3.9303,1.8578,3.5847,4.2506,3.3961,0.002,5.7058,4.1383,1.8333,3.1291,5.6209,5.004,0.8805,1.2537,2.0948,7.2213,3.7594,2.561,3.2129,3.7958,8.6917,3.7475,2.565,1.0197,4.9362,6.1765,6.7172,3.1479,2.9698,12.559,0.2475,5.0698,1.4537,4.186,5.0116,3.7033,1.8646,2.4804,2.7321,7.0362,1.3585,1.0192,2.1674,2.3742,2.3295,3.593,2.5943,4.0956,0.2302,2.5996,5.5774,0.057,2.1072,2.7794,0.0031,7.1666,2.2201,4.0563,1.7343,1.1407,6.0645,6.3758,1.346,1.843,0.3594,2.0687,5.0292,1.4281,2.1218,2.2667,3.0158,1.7327,3.0055,0.0496,3.7343,0.4827,2.5017,3.5288,3.1418,4.9347,0.0354,3.0595,4.9062,1.2005,0.2189,6.0404,6.3116,4.8633,9.4574,1.498,7.584,0.5899,1.7659,5.9238,3.7792,1.1921,3.0172,2.8246,6.6521,2.9136,2.0501,10.9731,1.4946,5.2961,3.0131,3.6038,1.4873,3.6415,4.8733,4.9343,3.5071,1.0072,4.9255,1.2433,0.8721,3.776,1.4945,1.4873,5.9646,0.8661,1.8141,1.1378,1.1355,3.7701,0.0376,1.9951,0.1097,6.4313,0.021,3.6075,2.907,3.9744,2.2207,0.2676,3.7877,4.9071,5.2974,4.0371,3.345,3.4191,2.8166,2.3199,1.2273,3.9183,4.9109,1.4681,2.9729,2.2788,6.0465,0.0004,3.8596,6.069,1.5553,1.6853,3.6936,3.7976,7.8594,0.3265,2.6227,3.7738,0.6607,5.6449,0.0006,5.372,6.5352,0.1239,2.8803,4.1615,6.4821,0.0584,2.2694,1.5191,0.6658,1.6713,3.6853,4.1025,1.6777,2.9777,5.1865,2.1993,2.0996,5.3016,3.7353,0.3729,0.0821,1.9924,4.8168,6.2578,6.5236,0.4075,0.1615,5.2107,2.8579,5.9706,2.7049,1.0895,0.7894,8.3935,3.628,1.0686,0.5039,2.7084,1.9201,1.3268,1.5825,3.2817,3.3835,2.2799,1.385,1.8139,0.767,1.939,5.253,0.9099,1.0244,2.6714,5.7326,2.2062,0.2643,7.2662,4.4937,0.1655,0.1064,1.3874,3.4123,1.5172,1.6847,2.0457,5.1236,5.1118,2.3786,3.8734,2.1159,2.4735,1.1224,0.8743,0.7977,3.4452,1.1348,4.5517,0.0381,1.9656,1.5912,0.9303,2.9959,0.912,4.1914,1.261,3.6805,2.8179,7.2746,1.8528,0.0867,4.5472,5.5947,0.1616,0.9117,4.2461,3.87,0.7882,6.234,1.2331,3.6097,0.0085,2.4349,3.4542,2.2012,4.621,0.8049,3.4672,0.8301,1.0862,1.6356,2.6756,0.3001,0.0782,1.7168,2.918,3.4273,4.6519,1.9219,3.6307,1.4373,1.6558,0.5813,2.4391,0.0067,2.0634,4.1359,2.6398,3.0059,3.6443,7.2102,3.6535,2.7336,5.6135,4.288,5.0551,4.9709,3.5226,4.4043,0.5019,2.3857,3.5811,1.0327,3.4601,5.0243,4.1566,4.5879,4.2332,6.1636,4.0356,3.8453,4.3448,5.738,2.4231,1.8831,2.4085,3.3557,6.1948,0.0024,3.7353,3.3935,5.4279,1.748,2.2892,0.4054,0.3778,2.3305,3.4443,1.6566,3.1462,2.2968,2.5505,1.031,1.5369,3.953,1.1475,1.6722,3.767,1.0264,0.2122,5.8834,1.8564,0.7597]}

In six month time, no one will remember that you are a politician, because the world is already a global village. You can\u2019t hide behind walls or hide in any cave. And what will become of millions of people who voted for the government you are part of. That\u2019s a question the government hasn\u2019t even thought about. They will continue their lives with hopes, fears and dreams. For many people nothing will change.\u201d\nThe current crisis of global finance is not only an economic one but more importantly a political one. There are forces at work which are attempting to bring back the days of the economic nationalism, which have characterized the last 40 years of the 20th century, during which a global financial order developed gradually, from the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the mid-1970s until the global financial crisis.\n\u201cThe global financial crisis is a political event and not just an economic event. It\u2019s a political crisis. A crisis of the order that became global. And this is a crisis that will change the world. The idea that economic issues cannot affect people politically, that political issues can\u2019t affect economics, is outdated. And all the signs say that this is going to change the world for the worse.\u201d\nIn the light of the upcoming elections in the US, Britain and the European Union, as well as the coming parliamentary, parliamentary and presidential elections in France, Mr. Cohn-Bendit\u2019s prediction has become even more relevant. There are some very strong indications that this trend has not yet turned. The crisis is also spreading to other parts of the world in different forms.\nDuring the past few years the world has undergone a process of globalization characterized by the erosion of the political authority of national governments. At the same time the processes of liberalization and globalization have been implemented at many different levels, and the influence that the world governments and business organizations have developed, has greatly increased.","token_len":414,"entropy":[3.5943,3.8104,4.6582,0.039,7.7864,0.6153,2.1694,3.0816,3.8872,0.1466,1.0431,4.4348,5.7055,8.4253,1.4624,1.2916,3.8243,0.1283,0.2388,4.5129,4.5253,0.4909,1.5311,2.1953,6.208,1.8452,4.025,2.876,3.807,1.5222,3.3073,3.2977,6.6061,5.3676,0.8405,2.9449,2.8016,17.0701,8.3401,1.2129,4.933,2.8052,5.9057,2.2289,2.1379,1.5467,6.1412,6.4367,1.0754,3.7184,4.3005,2.8643,3.5859,0.2004,8.0026,0.2882,1.004,1.1794,6.0354,0.5492,2.8141,5.0623,5.0285,2.5226,5.5741,0.0176,4.2852,3.8876,5.5584,0.2047,1.0903,2.823,3.0527,5.3376,3.2056,5.5764,1.855,0.2029,0.0541,4.3898,3.1069,0.9336,0.8527,4.2078,2.8334,4.5886,3.8106,5.4217,3.0057,6.903,3.1314,3.5949,0.8861,2.0351,1.2426,5.0753,4.3734,2.2216,8.1661,1.3188,0.5553,0.7939,3.6244,8.6096,1.4017,5.8017,5.0871,4.8991,2.8899,5.1666,6.2598,1.1406,2.3543,2.6361,3.0093,1.5834,2.0187,1.7826,6.7437,1.193,1.0841,0.9146,0.041,0.2701,3.8799,1.2552,7.061,2.1538,0.1262,3.3689,1.6181,4.3531,0.0279,4.0557,4.385,1.0013,6.239,0.5551,1.6874,6.1982,7.234,3.2076,2.3627,3.3657,6.5943,0.8028,3.2818,4.7614,0.084,1.1562,1.2579,3.0633,0.026,0.0908,2.2313,5.405,0.423,3.9851,3.6109,1.9546,4.1495,5.0866,7.9418,1.8165,4.6194,1.0305,4.4893,0.0649,0.5171,1.6018,0.0012,0.0003,1.0981,1.6851,0.9148,4.2017,0.5366,2.0873,0.1984,3.331,0.466,3.1487,0.3089,0.2388,2.56,1.9309,5.0994,4.6587,3.561,2.7273,0.3195,1.6564,1.4508,1.5439,2.7559,4.5528,2.7014,2.8304,2.034,2.3697,0.0708,5.4328,0.3306,0.9468,3.3873,0.5839,0.2267,0.6517,1.29,2.1811,2.4931,4.3322,2.2688,1.1921,1.9716,4.8065,2.1054,6.4749,2.947,1.9963,3.4213,2.7569,1.611,2.4601,0.5279,1.3026,2.103,4.3459,0.6626,1.2257,1.2163,2.6702,6.7336,0.7292,5.0157,6.0755,3.6835,4.8523,2.9346,9.6022,1.8379,2.2478,2.568,0.5725,1.7226,4.0836,0.1457,0.0106,0.6907,7.0568,1.0545,1.2524,6.5424,0.5728,3.4972,5.6574,1.8498,4.6681,4.8189,0.6649,2.1016,0.8028,3.3122,0.0445,1.6263,1.3136,0.2166,3.9864,0.2123,1.8865,0.2104,2.5269,1.2956,0.3781,3.5801,1.3731,6.573,0.0426,1.0996,6.3528,1.9347,1.8214,1.9425,2.2672,0.8504,8.1818,1.1861,1.7589,2.2761,0.0455,0.6615,4.6099,0.5017,0.0105,0.878,4.8672,5.3882,7.614,3.2424,0.5165,1.5551,0.0786,1.0748,2.3919,0.6257,9.8531,0.5975,9.4722,3.6108,0.4374,1.3916,1.2853,3.6193,0.1284,0.8925,4.2548,3.2059,2.3364,4.1556,0.1281,4.7533,0.3336,4.5014,1.3928,4.5074,3.4421,3.3529,2.0399,0.2535,2.8555,5.1949,3.7216,3.8122,2.5811,3.693,3.5126,2.0943,5.3026,2.0821,4.5948,5.3538,1.81,1.051,1.4163,0.0047,0.195,0.1605,4.4276,4.1545,3.06,0.5762,1.629,5.9474,0.2991,2.3173,1.5755,0.9243,2.454,2.7021,0.629,4.5399,0.6367,5.4379,0.3746,2.8434,7.4195,0.0747,1.6962,7.1059,0.0582,1.6439,4.6553,5.4451,0.2234,5.0551,0.4861,0.9355,4.5278,0.505,0.4821,0.0032,2.1068,7.7724,0.3866,7.2689,0.2261,1.3095,2.2279,0.6121,2.3362,6.1581,3.6688,5.6562,2.2423,0.2877,1.957,2.332,2.1588,5.6321,3.6259,2.3105,4.2667,7.6338,3.1231,4.0824,2.7377,0.7745,7.3577,3.7533,1.6094,4.8634,1.2766,0.3175]}

You go back in time to warn your younger self about this, but by accident you end up in a past earlier than intended and have to talk to your 8-year-old-self. In this past, you can be whatever you want, doing all the fun things. Your old self is happy and doing her usual stuff, as if she hasn't seen you. You are happy too, as if you don't understand what happened in the past. Then suddenly the old self shows up, and starts shouting at the future you about a love she had when she was younger, and you're left confused and angry with both of them, knowing that maybe this is what she wanted you to understand.\n\" The person the future self is talking to (the older and wiser self in her present) does not feel bad about the past love of the younger self. The future self feels that past, even as she believes that she doesn't \" understand it \" and it is too late to do something about it.\nI feel you are the same :)I also think there is something interesting about time traveling. As I understand it, it is not possible to go back in time. Maybe one can go in time to past, but at the moment you are not at that point. So time travel is something that can be only an inner experience; and the outer world can never be altered. But there is something that, in a certain situation, can be accomplished : to go back in time with a different intention than the original one.\nI like that interpretation. You are, however, not allowed to change the whole state of the universe in order to achieve a different outcome. But even a small alteration can cause new effects in the universe.\nIn fiction, one usually talks about an omnipotent (or omniscient) god, but this would be impossible according to special relativity (no one exists with infinite speed).

{"prompt":"Battlemage","text":"Battlemage, etc.), a unique challenge that can only be solved when players work together. A challenge that most players on the server have not faced before.\nA new update to the world has begun on September 1st and we can report that players now have access to two new dungeons, the Dungeon of the Enchantress and Dungeon of the Guardian, where they will fight against powerful bosses. As one of the bosses of the Guardian dungeon, the player will have to fight the Corrupted Lightsaber Master. The Enchantress dungeon is new for many players, as it isn\u2019t as commonplace as being in the Arena \u2013 and as such, it hasn\u2019t been seen before. The first dungeon\u2019s main room will be called the Tale of Shadow, and players will be faced with the Ruined Shadow Lift that will take them to various places. It is important to note that the Tale of Shadow is not a permanent dungeon, but a short adventure designed for players to experience. This means that players are free to return and explore it as many times as they like.\nPlayers will find that they are also able to explore the world of the new Zandalari Warband, where they can visit the Zandalari Headquarters located in the Dedicated zone. Players can also make use of the new Dedicated zone with their friends and can visit the new Hearthfire Inn at the same time.\nThere is also a new dungeon for each race, and players can experience them as many times as they like. This means that players will have access to The Enchantress Dungeon, the Dungeon of the Guardian Dungeon and the Dungeon of the Mage\u2019s Guild at any given time. These dungeons give players access to new rewards and unique rewards (and a unique reward that can\u2019t be found anywhere else), as well as the opportunity to interact with new or unseen characters from the respective Races.\nZak is available in the new Arena zone. This means that players can earn more experience points through PVP battles on September 1st and August 29th.","token_len":415,"entropy":[11.0983,2.9246,7.1606,3.1802,4.7203,5.7617,6.5907,2.3179,2.741,2.5532,0.0677,2.9347,3.9613,4.3758,5.4126,0.09,1.3314,4.4831,4.572,1.9081,6.1571,1.1255,6.7507,1.2673,2.9994,2.9467,3.1909,3.9447,0.9523,0.9502,1.2363,9.2302,3.4871,6.4684,2.1151,0.8022,5.233,4.7121,3.6853,4.2388,3.3251,3.1943,0.279,3.3721,3.043,4.0186,5.265,0.726,3.5495,3.8133,0.4822,1.5642,0.0209,4.561,0.4238,2.9214,2.2385,2.0192,4.9839,0.9046,1.5733,8.2508,0.6014,0.2342,3.1089,0.0962,0.254,5.8042,2.1897,4.3217,2.3963,1.4126,2.691,2.157,4.1131,3.3262,1.5518,4.2769,5.014,0.4871,0.2399,4.4681,3.1366,0.7622,6.9051,1.7822,0.356,1.7877,2.0591,1.1536,1.5816,0.5829,1.9025,2.3122,8.0722,0.6438,11.3542,2.9037,4.2257,3.1664,2.0768,6.188,0.0024,1.658,1.5355,6.5232,2.9328,4.9823,1.1587,1.425,2.1162,0.8096,7.3409,15.8363,7.764,1.4876,3.3117,9.3087,0.706,5.5314,1.6866,1.1763,5.1952,6.8827,2.8537,3.8127,0.5558,0.8899,1.2977,5.9675,0.9575,0.4262,0.0126,0.5642,4.1777,2.7241,0.7216,1.879,4.4105,1.7102,9.9893,0.1345,1.7205,11.3171,6.1316,1.8118,0.8658,5.4383,0.8824,10.7988,0.2542,6.1989,1.9518,1.0035,3.8151,0.4787,1.2999,4.5397,0.0778,1.6125,8.3842,0.5562,3.5935,12.205,4.0837,0.9453,2.7239,0.8172,1.2708,5.508,3.3316,2.5885,3.8056,1.1964,4.0951,0.2001,0.2275,0.1698,1.3559,5.514,0.0426,0.1799,1.4094,1.6068,1.6178,5.7397,1.0919,0.7999,1.0818,2.4786,5.3329,5.3462,5.5855,2.4237,1.5588,0.9422,2.6192,1.5309,2.938,3.8699,0.1812,1.5931,3.328,2.3791,0.0172,4.7959,2.9383,1.8659,4.7524,2.3352,3.4994,0.0487,0.074,0.1071,1.3575,0.8327,1.3317,2.9389,0.8575,3.8299,1.5314,2.7519,2.1743,4.0499,1.3686,0.0034,3.659,0.9807,3.9001,0.7921,1.3642,4.9799,8.1111,4.4845,0.035,5.4865,3.5496,1.3455,2.4985,1.3072,2.6874,5.4904,1.6263,4.7803,0.1701,0.1267,7.7683,4.8175,0.7688,0.5883,12.8946,1.8845,6.1603,0.922,2.1541,1.6221,0.8225,5.1604,1.9901,0.0033,0.6417,2.3879,8.7872,0.0744,2.2036,4.5698,3.0454,4.203,2.0859,4.9011,3.7024,0.9716,3.2909,10.4644,1.5591,5.639,4.1284,0.725,2.9727,0.0434,0.5325,1.3357,3.4767,1.749,0.8163,0.6297,0.4236,3.3401,3.0071,3.9423,5.9911,1.1159,2.4084,2.6479,1.2623,3.9166,4.5238,2.3519,3.6703,0.0494,0.027,0.0437,0.2686,0.4903,2.8632,2.177,0.0839,1.2307,1.0691,1.7369,1.4711,0.0076,7.0089,6.2051,0.0075,2.8561,1.1175,2.191,2.0582,0.0098,0.0691,0.9236,1.4167,0.9888,0.4528,0.8702,0.0068,0.0658,6.3565,10.8891,0.2404,0.4394,2.1491,4.8476,3.158,3.1202,0.0962,0.1978,3.8825,1.5681,5.7213,0.4271,2.2688,0.0087,2.4667,4.3088,1.5681,4.7531,2.8805,5.4997,3.1233,3.0625,3.8436,3.3494,2.8846,1.8425,7.587,0.046,0.022,0.1176,1.9258,3.3238,1.298,2.9459,1.6407,0.0165,0.006,2.5076,2.2346,0.1019,4.8259,0.0705,3.4842,5.5808,7.5594,2.388,3.1733,0.5619,7.8005,5.7332,0.4897,0.7475,5.4865,6.2759,5.2423,5.4287,1.9885,1.404,3.0299,3.7704,5.4781,2.3144,3.2115,3.313,0.0641,0.6305,1.1261,5.4114,3.9449,2.5164,1.8261,3.2026,8.7809,0.1373,3.7181,4.1544,9.6904,0.3884,0.0292,1.129,3.7817,3.2403,0.0084,0.8127]}
{"prompt":"Death has been eradicated . War , however , has not .","text":"Death has been eradicated. War, however, has not. Somewhere the world\u2019s men and women are fighting. But you, who are young and strong, must decide to enter the battle instead of sitting in the trenches with your eyes closed.\nI don\u2019t think of anything much at all. I think, as I always do, that I am the only one awake in this hotel room. It is a strange thing how often things happen in silence. You were talking to me just now and you were talking about something about the war. You said that some men and women were being killed. Not so many, I know. But still, someone was being killed.\nMy mind is wandering. I remember something about a big war in London years ago ; many young men and women had been killed. I remember, for example, the story of a young couple who were having a lovely home, and their baby was stillborn. You may remember that ; I don\u2019t think I had said much about that, except that I think that was lovely. They were a very normal couple, and in the end their grief was beautiful. They lived outside London, but they went to see the remains of what their child had died. They had been in the front line, and so they had been away from London, and some of the Londoners had wanted to put up a memorial stone for the baby. But the couple decided not to do that. The people from London took things into their own hands, and they put a stone there of their own.\nYou must remember I do know how to make memories. When a terrible thing happens you try not to stop thinking about it. But, of course, one has to try to make sense out of it some time. Some time always comes when memories are put on the shelf for the reason that you must let other memories come first. One tries not to stop making memories. It\u2019s just that we have different memories for different things. They\u2019re stored in different places.","token_len":416,"entropy":[5.9675,1.7461,7.1153,0.0042,1.7574,7.6828,3.5891,4.334,0.0579,1.2231,2.2246,1.1247,8.9659,4.4896,3.5452,14.4405,7.1821,4.7262,7.7663,1.0363,0.1994,1.5001,4.196,2.8235,4.0699,4.5666,2.5951,3.4975,1.8718,6.3074,1.0385,2.9223,0.4783,3.1065,4.6984,2.9486,5.9009,0.8699,2.4495,5.9311,0.798,5.747,2.3226,1.0637,4.0047,4.4522,0.9572,4.1403,0.6351,0.5414,2.2541,6.5989,3.9131,7.2725,1.0062,0.4218,2.486,4.7465,5.425,6.5085,5.226,0.4875,1.8921,1.2457,2.0358,4.4542,2.9314,1.4089,3.9292,0.6312,0.1474,1.2946,1.9349,1.4844,2.5382,1.9862,0.8287,6.375,3.025,1.7811,9.6704,1.2334,0.9161,3.6576,0.8307,2.2304,3.8102,3.3201,7.8301,3.3023,4.5438,2.9175,2.3689,7.2363,0.7634,3.965,5.2918,4.5475,0.7625,1.117,4.6544,0.5359,2.9278,1.9784,1.7419,1.9102,1.6833,2.9095,4.6692,2.1497,1.9395,0.8471,2.0688,2.5962,1.3063,5.1226,4.1099,3.2558,0.0472,2.0468,3.7805,1.5351,1.5739,5.9255,3.7075,2.9684,2.0386,2.1481,3.6288,0.5848,1.9678,5.2327,0.8689,6.8372,1.8852,2.7837,0.3396,0.4297,1.9387,5.0456,3.3278,1.8615,4.7735,0.9962,1.0908,4.5433,4.4148,2.7893,2.3834,5.5941,3.5479,2.4313,6.9711,7.3369,0.0754,11.9,7.0223,4.3583,0.4206,0.9487,0.0404,2.891,1.0619,0.6137,1.1832,1.713,1.4113,4.1407,2.9434,1.7162,0.0038,1.6237,4.9753,0.181,1.9286,0.9495,5.2374,0.9151,1.015,5.039,1.1837,6.2163,6.7151,3.4258,1.5002,3.1906,5.0078,1.377,4.1032,1.226,0.5384,4.3524,3.9618,1.2585,1.4941,10.2238,2.4148,2.3341,1.4316,0.2086,0.02,1.8368,2.5239,3.3881,4.6152,3.0417,0.7169,1.3159,2.1484,3.9813,0.7731,1.7599,3.1203,1.653,3.779,8.7683,0.6796,4.4471,1.0047,4.3352,2.6944,6.6479,0.3975,1.2535,1.5817,4.5722,2.0881,2.1164,3.989,7.0863,0.8801,7.364,0.5705,2.6544,4.218,6.8313,1.6839,1.1637,2.2938,1.499,4.4099,1.022,2.7841,1.4263,8.7714,0.0714,4.5808,5.2763,3.8335,0.7603,3.7506,2.214,2.1554,2.3851,2.5976,3.1856,1.5777,5.7989,1.2722,2.0269,1.0901,4.7906,1.3926,1.8898,1.7606,7.758,1.147,4.4987,2.319,1.1794,5.1363,0.7859,1.2634,7.9699,1.303,1.8821,6.631,0.1824,5.8093,2.6163,1.2024,1.1424,6.6682,2.9579,1.6049,3.595,0.7366,2.541,2.5083,5.1259,3.9932,2.8099,0.0015,1.059,1.0395,0.7225,2.8711,4.345,4.2748,2.2152,5.4565,6.026,3.531,0.0798,0.025,0.0058,1.2123,0.3379,1.4363,3.0964,2.4164,3.1722,3.1863,5.7563,1.4112,0.1337,1.8174,1.4971,3.4802,3.7092,2.105,5.1191,4.1491,4.1168,3.6857,2.6764,3.5417,6.0299,0.7015,3.702,3.8376,6.2648,2.7901,0.5797,3.8111,4.8895,3.2986,0.0055,6.337,1.892,0.7526,0.1852,0.5683,2.644,3.912,3.6034,0.0127,0.0268,4.8691,3.2036,0.1141,3.3248,1.0762,1.7538,3.5037,2.9504,0.0433,0.9414,8.5482,3.3914,1.1108,4.8221,2.397,7.5453,2.5506,1.2505,5.7075,1.0854,6.1758,3.4657,1.6913,3.5784,2.9061,2.6699,6.4917,0.5514,2.6557,3.7526,7.4012,6.8176,2.5219,2.9279,6.3561,0.2188,4.4202,6.04,2.3311,0.0035,3.467,5.0221,1.3893,1.3491,3.0813,8.7821,0.1669,0.1447,3.8311,1.8759,4.61,2.1094,4.6558,1.6111,2.9621,0.459,1.8231,0.4351,6.0444,4.6385,0.1387,0.87,8.6304,0.7601,1.0483,0.7413,1.0389]}

{"prompt":"Make the saddest love story without involving any deaths , breakups , or separations .","text":"Make the saddest love story without involving any deaths, breakups, or separations. It is such a story but without any of the dramatic element of a Romeo & Juliet. But what it gives is a touching romance between two people. It is about love and hate, lust, sex, longing, pain & happiness, and ultimately, is about life. With life is all is about making it and not giving it up for a little something. The story is not that different from some normal life\u2019s stories and it doesn\u2019t give you an extremely intense experience yet this story has a perfect place in a heart that loves emotional movies.\nStory : After breaking up with the same friend throughout their high school, four people from each corner of the world reconnect with him as they enter college. At the party, a girl gives them a drink that turns the night into a night of fun, drinking, love, and sex. Somewhere in between their fun drinking session they discover that they may have more in common than they realized.\nI just watched the movie. Well I had no expectations for it, because I had always heard people said how boring the movie was until I started watching it. The movie was a good movie but, the movie was not for me. When I first began watching this movie I was kind of interested to know what would happen but my interest was dropped after I saw halfway through it. Although, the movie was not bad, the characters are kind of boring for me. The movie had two characters, one girl was called Kaitlyn and the other was called Anna, and they were kind of boring for me. The movie also does not have any good suspense or tension and I was not really surprised by anything that happened in the movie, and all of the characters just looked lame to me. Although all the actors of the movie acted perfectly, but I don\u2019t think I would want to see anything to do with this movie again. Although, for some people it might be a good movie, but for me, not.","token_len":416,"entropy":[2.9769,10.9506,0.0313,9.1729,1.7685,8.0381,8.2115,2.7867,7.4126,2.007,8.3502,4.4885,0.2968,0.9919,7.96,0.0014,0.7699,2.9318,2.1899,6.0275,0.3007,4.0296,5.9934,4.0228,1.8527,3.0967,0.29,6.4223,5.9594,1.7318,2.687,9.2857,2.0347,0.0004,1.4689,4.6033,4.1245,2.653,5.3599,1.4587,1.2353,6.8976,4.7097,3.132,1.5292,2.7491,3.206,2.2256,1.016,3.8609,2.136,1.2225,4.3813,1.336,7.5495,1.6169,5.5286,0.3536,7.3518,0.5436,4.4239,6.4898,4.0996,0.8912,1.7002,5.2922,1.584,6.8542,0.719,3.8655,0.8233,6.0234,8.1192,3.6864,4.9604,6.6932,5.7361,5.6489,2.6746,3.0191,3.2035,4.674,0.9475,1.7853,3.6155,2.9164,4.2336,5.4869,1.0287,3.1581,2.3886,1.0681,3.1321,4.6134,4.4599,0.3051,4.982,8.1472,4.197,15.5501,6.709,6.153,3.7715,3.4667,2.4926,3.6733,7.4045,0.5013,0.2918,4.0555,2.3681,3.6165,7.6088,5.2995,2.8355,7.6523,4.8766,2.6937,3.022,1.5253,6.1419,6.2151,1.0097,3.4842,5.276,4.4745,3.8586,9.6667,9.4615,0.7856,1.8082,8.7108,5.2022,6.0368,7.2139,0.5105,0.3293,3.3518,5.2395,4.8821,7.4784,2.0605,5.0491,0.0599,2.9132,7.9538,3.9753,3.7907,4.2454,5.5606,0.1432,0.4971,1.0392,7.8972,2.3939,5.4219,4.0257,0.9765,5.3798,4.0338,0.6704,4.5477,1.4218,7.7453,1.0093,3.2796,2.9791,5.5621,3.1702,0.933,4.7207,3.4273,3.9217,3.9492,4.0064,0.9558,0.3335,2.2922,0.5303,4.2783,2.3218,5.9971,1.1811,4.2099,0.5436,0.6454,3.4841,0.2287,8.7004,1.3431,2.1477,3.8005,6.0056,5.6926,6.8652,3.3738,3.6699,1.1334,1.6774,5.2009,1.2059,5.7219,1.9696,0.0019,0.3995,0.8291,2.4277,0.554,2.7916,4.9896,5.0206,4.5048,1.8614,1.2799,2.5595,6.0292,2.662,4.3553,2.2707,6.4401,2.0977,1.3124,1.9041,4.1812,1.1285,2.8727,4.6453,4.7881,4.21,4.7793,5.0684,5.1907,2.0491,0.7583,0.4482,5.7734,1.1012,3.6696,0.3987,0.3049,0.6983,2.8162,1.725,1.7318,2.6131,3.6536,2.0396,2.2316,5.1544,3.3234,3.2088,1.2483,1.8281,4.0635,0.6924,0.4975,4.5851,0.5918,2.6568,4.7785,0.2951,2.1485,0.2526,1.1047,1.4752,5.7143,0.0053,5.6666,2.5893,1.9172,1.2977,4.218,0.3204,5.7583,4.8476,3.4282,1.5511,6.3645,2.6235,2.5864,2.127,9.0456,0.0601,2.2403,0.2848,6.302,1.8988,2.465,1.1033,1.321,2.3154,3.2607,1.3578,2.3541,3.2919,2.5928,5.3965,0.356,2.1135,4.804,0.6924,0.9294,1.8368,1.9534,3.1307,4.9429,3.4146,2.1538,2.0065,4.5442,4.1472,5.6805,5.1727,4.3033,0.7872,1.0549,0.4193,0.029,1.5746,1.1536,5.565,2.4602,2.1493,2.0418,1.211,3.8675,0.0175,3.218,2.2162,0.2254,0.5796,2.0654,1.8874,3.5853,5.1582,0.708,0.79,1.6383,4.3298,7.2379,2.0403,4.2023,2.8431,1.9136,2.2373,1.4881,2.7636,4.0706,1.9884,5.4582,1.8097,0.6409,1.9302,0.4682,0.2562,3.0306,4.1514,5.3699,1.5667,0.6067,1.4293,4.4831,3.854,6.2828,4.3822,0.1481,0.352,5.7179,6.1455,1.6414,4.8792,5.399,0.4974,0.233,5.2847,6.2538,1.0604,4.7475,2.1347,3.534,1.447,0.4416,0.2663,1.2642,2.2914,2.2604,3.9997,0.2848,2.3108,3.4537,4.7553,2.9319,0.1697,2.7379,0.5077,4.4819,0.5462,5.588,0.9151,5.113,1.9442,3.034,1.7175,2.4129,0.7673,1.6529,1.1579,0.6146,1.041,1.6986,1.0969,0.5625,1.1408,5.531,7.1069]}

No one is watching you. This is a message that I have in my bottle. It reads, `` I'm so sorry I did what I did. '' But there is no one to understand. I feel so bad. Can you help me find someone to let me in? Thank you.\nA couple of months ago, I had an appointment with a dermatologist. I decided that the appointment was going forward. I had never seen a dermatologist though I had had many a pimple. This time, she explained to me that an infection had moved onto my skin, which is why the inflammation was quite painful, that I had to keep on using it, and then take it off when I got back to the office a month or so down the line.\nMy husband and I thought we were going to leave when we got home. But then something clicked. We turned around and headed back to see her. That was the happiest day of the year for me.\nI have seen a number of doctors and other health professionals in the last six months. Some of them are wonderful. Others I just hated. None have been as helpful as a dermatologist.\nThe doctor listened to all of my concerns. It was my only appointment and she spent the whole day. When I got home I had a bottle of Tobrex and I still have it. She gave me a prescription of Motrin and a lotus syrup. I had to read the bottle because I didn\u2019t understand it. The next day I bought the medicine. I didn\u2019t dare ask her why since I wouldn\u2019t know what to say.\nThat summer I had to have a section of my hair cut off. It was so sad. But I am thankful. It will be another half a year until I have to have it cut off again.","token_len":416,"entropy":[6.8149,5.0477,3.3799,6.0752,3.9623,5.2943,3.7353,2.1189,7.7541,3.1884,1.7138,4.6972,1.9528,1.8867,2.1285,1.4009,8.1188,8.948,1.8698,4.4981,0.7252,3.6134,3.0683,4.5217,0.5096,1.1763,0.3562,1.0964,5.3625,2.3923,4.0251,1.6647,1.072,3.6691,8.1614,0.9802,2.8851,0.3938,1.6332,3.4978,3.328,0.9825,4.633,0.388,1.864,3.4428,0.599,0.3889,4.5745,0.3566,2.4403,4.2329,2.7959,2.6478,2.2593,6.1319,0.2326,4.987,0.519,2.2304,3.3183,0.611,0.1301,1.3307,0.993,1.0696,0.026,3.4341,1.1654,4.2307,0.5773,0.4857,1.194,2.5508,4.0195,3.2312,0.4036,0.7674,1.7525,1.6264,5.2121,1.6147,3.9379,3.5669,3.2198,2.7862,1.1185,6.5142,0.8354,2.9497,0.0991,4.2083,2.9719,0.9453,5.2523,0.4632,3.3531,0.4808,6.6591,0.0913,0.9299,2.8611,7.4205,3.6434,0.4229,2.9301,1.7065,1.125,0.8331,3.0887,2.6067,2.4323,0.6513,0.9512,5.0308,0.0213,0.9091,1.8881,5.0125,1.9425,3.0901,4.9927,0.9528,3.7332,8.9894,1.3421,1.3057,2.1978,3.616,2.0455,1.1169,1.3523,0.0158,9.5525,2.3959,1.2944,4.1018,3.0004,5.4486,6.2418,0.0829,1.4765,4.3104,2.652,1.0375,3.3237,4.9895,1.8095,0.0637,0.428,6.3485,3.1588,1.5901,6.9791,4.0388,0.575,0.7739,2.0517,2.1945,2.7375,1.5291,2.7524,6.7901,1.2057,6.6494,4.063,3.1266,5.2996,1.4974,1.4877,1.5936,5.2513,2.2089,3.3595,2.7101,2.6269,0.7648,3.9866,6.0716,1.7029,0.9295,4.4485,0.4826,2.2245,1.594,1.1229,1.4997,2.5963,6.078,4.0239,2.1645,0.5874,7.9504,0.0706,2.1103,0.121,2.5067,3.8921,4.5913,1.287,0.0305,5.0256,1.9566,1.4473,1.0457,0.0734,5.7868,5.2363,1.0903,1.3172,1.297,1.0477,2.9898,2.8693,3.7046,4.5663,0.7202,1.87,6.3103,2.1182,0.385,4.7343,1.9299,0.3292,6.0854,3.8636,0.4144,5.4375,1.5142,1.6828,6.1626,1.2999,0.234,3.2164,1.5208,1.9079,0.599,0.3634,2.0171,1.7052,3.3193,3.9596,2.3398,3.4085,0.002,3.7916,2.2446,4.4525,3.1738,0.7324,2.8831,1.1102,1.5944,3.895,0.4436,0.7641,4.1346,1.241,0.2425,1.6419,4.8273,1.3841,2.9998,4.2848,4.4894,7.0967,0.4755,4.9254,4.729,2.2503,2.5512,2.6516,0.6625,5.3195,0.7135,0.0104,0.5663,1.7586,2.8468,2.765,8.9565,0.7716,3.6173,0.8825,0.8146,1.127,1.259,4.0739,0.8108,4.4306,4.6444,3.5602,2.5762,1.75,7.0601,1.4399,2.1279,0.9782,4.8889,3.4127,1.0637,2.4392,0.402,2.6737,3.199,1.9517,5.5324,0.4503,9.6886,11.2356,2.0029,2.3106,5.5363,1.4429,1.7921,1.0736,2.6626,3.3168,0.1818,0.8523,2.9568,3.7872,9.0539,0.3609,1.8575,2.5876,3.8737,8.3322,5.796,0.8654,1.2767,3.02,1.5377,5.3516,1.6178,4.9048,4.363,0.8953,2.2094,16.0524,7.1573,1.6034,2.2618,2.4495,0.614,3.2743,2.8628,0.4881,0.8948,4.509,2.4787,3.9056,1.5152,1.2808,3.4927,0.5475,0.1921,0.0012,8.7089,3.3921,1.8495,2.6898,6.9042,0.9627,5.4801,0.0792,0.0896,0.0168,2.1608,1.6888,1.7049,2.6604,0.5264,1.4739,4.5553,5.1235,0.897,2.2151,2.9667,3.4628,1.1797,10.2897,1.2533,0.5684,4.9958,0.905,3.8755,0.9315,2.0375,0.7127,2.5943,6.578,1.0723,3.5119,1.4514,4.1541,3.8977,2.725,2.4623,4.2772,1.4829,4.9797,6.193,1.3045,0.2237,1.9248,0.4348,2.1817,2.2506,2.249,2.318,2.3461,1.1815,0.9315,0.2087]}

You are sitting in your locked cell waiting to post bail when you hear faint screams and even some gunfire somewhere in the facility.. Not being able to leave your cell, your heart begins to race.. All of a sudden, your cell doors open as you hear someone shout out. One of your fellow inmates has been shot.. You rush over to him as you feel you are starting to lose him to death.. \" W... what do we do \"?.\nThe video above shows how one small correctional facility was able to use a cellphone to notify the police, and in a very timely manner, prevent a tragedy of another type.\nAs I sat there reading the article, I could only look at this as a very lucky thing. But the point is not luck.. The officers were alert enough and knew exactly what should be done for their fellow officers.. They were not scared or timid.. They acted very professionally, even though they were not used to seeing anything like that happen.\nIt makes me smile when I hear how some people think of corrections officers as cowards, cowards because of their color, and so they don't want to work there. It makes me laugh that some people can think that they are superior because of the training they have undergone, and they don't want to be in a facility that is doing such nice things for them, that gives them a second chance in life.\nWe all should strive to do our work in the best way we know how. There is absolutely no shame at all in a corrections officer having to do their job the best way they can within the constraints of a particular facility. If all people on earth were just that good, then perhaps, we wouldn't need corrections facilities. But unfortunately, that's not the case. I can tell you from personal experience, you have no idea what it can take to break a person, what is the toll on a human being, if they are not given a second chance in this life.","token_len":416,"entropy":[5.5189,2.4348,6.4347,1.6366,5.1619,5.3964,4.5339,1.3149,0.6427,5.2076,1.1464,2.965,3.1409,7.5618,3.2032,1.1992,1.602,1.8918,3.7054,6.1695,1.0539,1.9421,9.2083,3.156,3.5302,1.1171,9.3421,1.1359,4.711,1.4743,2.1118,11.5926,3.6897,1.7478,6.605,4.0644,4.8032,8.661,0.8734,0.3904,7.9805,7.9807,6.4065,5.6339,0.5643,0.0016,3.3994,1.5143,0.5553,2.2773,3.448,4.7397,3.8924,0.2604,1.4659,3.5937,5.668,1.7081,0.4362,0.001,1.0499,2.5258,2.5711,3.148,1.0088,4.6722,1.0893,2.3906,3.5569,3.4507,3.1978,4.3738,5.4264,0.3617,1.9366,3.2202,0.9144,4.0908,1.8586,1.0404,5.6432,2.4979,5.2092,2.8054,0.7051,1.9091,3.7161,1.4255,4.3978,5.3968,1.3996,8.1847,0.0582,2.6275,5.9253,4.2706,4.6241,2.1306,4.1512,9.335,5.4578,3.0288,3.4323,3.8527,0.3298,7.2935,5.4097,7.786,3.4089,6.3031,5.415,3.704,1.94,3.1856,4.2216,8.5114,8.021,0.4054,3.2961,3.5294,0.0023,4.8241,1.9608,5.599,1.1667,5.2797,1.3574,2.5347,3.2429,1.9143,4.6293,2.7794,2.417,5.047,0.3511,1.3748,4.6978,1.4483,5.0062,3.9524,6.5481,1.7334,0.6609,1.2844,3.7854,3.0321,5.5099,1.4907,4.1048,2.0123,3.147,0.9322,0.532,3.2144,2.8726,3.9818,0.6955,3.6736,4.311,0.8035,3.3929,5.355,2.7401,0.8922,4.6059,3.0711,4.6222,0.9355,4.3538,11.6195,3.5045,1.7734,9.9832,2.0535,7.8052,3.9136,3.3071,3.6465,2.5048,0.2896,6.9137,1.1621,0.3567,4.961,1.6583,1.8596,3.8004,2.2466,2.5671,1.8717,3.0307,3.6579,3.1243,7.3108,1.5638,1.0451,5.0291,5.1296,3.1852,2.3242,4.0441,1.7076,0.9359,1.0709,2.4625,5.1333,0.0456,4.0535,5.0819,0.7712,2.3603,1.3271,0.8584,1.1375,3.7078,4.8243,1.0575,5.1052,1.9941,0.3304,2.5979,4.0168,5.1873,2.4518,3.6324,2.1468,6.9038,1.1217,1.0167,6.5727,0.0128,2.0077,6.4641,0.0058,4.4645,1.7033,1.0294,6.8953,1.296,1.106,3.8634,2.7874,3.4105,0.0019,2.4584,0.273,4.4689,4.0119,0.9691,2.864,0.9284,0.1409,2.1487,4.2618,2.4067,0.9246,4.1408,2.9097,1.4433,1.8748,1.0606,5.6237,3.0796,0.6509,3.2019,6.3267,0.6155,1.3316,5.1186,1.9395,1.2565,3.0163,2.4213,0.0011,0.9639,0.0744,2.0372,2.3119,1.9083,4.3643,1.2543,1.4129,5.0121,3.9759,8.5805,0.5828,1.8867,2.3137,2.9049,3.6676,5.4259,0.1255,1.9373,4.4462,0.2243,3.8668,0.9261,0.7222,0.8935,5.0167,2.1567,4.4746,3.323,0.6644,2.7859,2.1392,4.917,2.4133,1.8763,0.7552,0.8955,2.0553,3.5026,0.1721,1.9662,4.3919,1.0369,4.7158,0.3081,4.5262,6.0046,0.1712,0.7662,4.0778,5.2288,2.299,4.9505,0.6043,2.8423,3.1627,0.5115,5.1884,3.503,0.8693,0.5051,1.5247,6.9496,0.8952,3.3575,0.2612,3.3419,4.7675,4.409,0.7389,3.7958,5.8377,5.3553,3.8825,4.5315,1.6372,4.487,4.4329,1.3735,0.7226,2.3569,4.8345,5.1907,2.1768,2.5801,0.0008,1.9593,2.7395,6.1886,1.331,1.9517,4.7154,0.278,2.4895,1.9627,0.3731,0.5836,0.1156,0.5917,3.6044,3.3779,2.298,0.0217,2.0846,1.655,0.0331,1.7757,4.8623,2.7851,2.6442,1.1935,1.2421,2.4055,4.3466,1.6874,0.2368,5.614,2.1738,2.9431,3.895,4.7299,4.5869,2.1094,5.8422,3.5798,2.46,4.4278,0.1797,1.6703,4.0072,2.2228,1.2475,2.0055,2.9141,2.2607,2.6521,0.0304,2.4435,5.3771,1.4992,0.818]}

After entering the execution room, instead of being executed, you were instead given a new passport and a new identity. Turns out the death sentence had been abolished years ago, and now exists only as a deterrent to violent crime and not actually implemented. Life has resumed as before and the whole case is a ruse to bring you to your true crime and capture your enemies.\nYou have now been freed and are a successful criminal. The only question you have to answer is how to escape. The answer to this is really simple - get out the country. Go to the airport, show the passport and you should be able to make it to an international border town such as Calais. From there you can get to the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania... anywhere, as long as you have the passports and passport photos with you.\nThe biggest thing is to make sure that you are actually being pursued to your true identity and will not be arrested or sentenced again as long as you have not been exposed yet.\nGood luck,\nRusty\n\nA:\n\nThe real solution was to keep the identity secret, and when asked, to \"confuse\" the questions in a storyline manner. I chose to make the escape to Romania, with me being Romanian, while having Italian citizenship, since I know Romania well, having been there when I lived in London for the past decade.\nThe final (and unexpected) twist was, once we landed in Romania, I had been forced into retirement by a military court, because I broke an international law. (The case was being considered by the courts of The Netherlands for being a violation of their laws. The court was not happy and wanted me to be put on the state run pension scheme for all retired citizens, even though this would have meant a substantial punishment.)\nWe were on a list of some 70 of us of British citizens who were supposed to be extradited to Romania, but, because we had the storyline right and they didn't know where I was, we escaped.","token_len":417,"entropy":[3.8828,9.1805,0.1442,2.5406,1.5953,5.8541,7.5992,1.1888,5.0207,3.5324,0.4453,8.6123,0.0141,3.0036,3.6663,0.4575,0.5594,5.4415,6.1479,3.0206,0.7735,4.2731,7.2337,1.7554,1.4279,0.9966,3.4132,1.6871,10.7695,0.0014,2.799,4.8727,2.89,4.254,0.8476,6.3014,4.9621,1.7647,1.1776,1.0936,2.9054,9.3217,1.2504,1.6803,0.3453,4.8811,0.7187,5.436,0.9242,2.7831,5.8305,7.3985,6.7921,0.9805,7.9962,3.13,6.1008,1.5076,5.7548,3.4923,2.1302,5.4808,5.5076,0.9921,3.3786,6.4305,0.3202,0.9541,4.8432,4.1364,1.7497,2.6157,6.9904,3.4414,3.1506,7.9089,1.7671,4.5513,0.5219,1.6588,8.2278,2.606,4.695,1.6065,4.4422,2.3363,2.2497,4.4932,5.937,2.7251,1.1236,2.9642,2.5399,3.0463,2.9486,0.6817,1.3112,1.1702,0.3153,2.2419,2.4617,2.8099,2.1781,2.7436,3.9016,1.8179,1.0494,1.182,5.8091,1.2167,3.4932,3.5804,0.9156,5.089,4.179,1.3345,4.7654,0.8381,1.7592,3.9844,1.4199,6.7355,2.5049,3.6308,1.4172,3.0506,3.2551,0.3219,1.3557,0.0028,3.8943,0.8058,0.8485,6.313,3.2559,5.0213,3.986,6.3978,0.0126,5.3564,0.6147,4.866,0.2608,1.2989,1.0102,2.8979,1.2829,1.3805,5.4334,1.7103,5.8731,0.5512,4.049,0.5588,4.5712,0.4556,1.6763,6.0148,6.0636,3.5145,4.214,0.1636,0.0178,0.1821,2.2186,1.703,5.8587,1.3135,5.7843,3.4776,5.4379,0.9414,0.455,1.7511,2.3668,5.4932,3.9258,2.2885,1.5526,3.1504,0.8307,1.2167,0.5142,1.5595,5.0507,4.6168,4.9371,4.5937,1.7185,2.6524,4.6042,2.0261,4.7574,1.2724,0.7218,2.7928,1.924,5.4133,3.9841,5.08,2.3897,0.0088,0.1886,2.3213,4.9913,1.4772,5.6023,7.4232,0.5376,1.5277,6.9974,0.2098,2.2012,3.1769,9.2904,0.6955,1.5585,6.3893,4.532,4.5324,2.8537,4.5945,3.1682,5.1015,4.9142,3.5799,0.7502,4.5032,1.4723,6.6246,2.8142,2.0767,2.3204,5.9826,5.0461,3.1643,3.4851,4.618,5.7143,3.2961,1.3853,1.0748,7.1647,3.9123,2.093,10.7703,6.6231,0.8086,2.5179,5.3002,0.9662,3.0023,1.599,7.4425,3.1981,5.3047,2.1028,4.5604,5.8037,1.6308,7.5748,1.2077,4.0263,4.5094,7.7191,2.5528,1.6411,3.5976,0.9947,4.1876,5.2097,3.9084,2.2028,5.6791,2.2457,3.0979,4.6519,0.8044,4.9876,1.5015,3.5195,2.0665,2.4802,1.6098,3.4816,0.8456,1.1745,2.1599,4.6797,6.6159,1.1298,7.8292,0.0721,3.077,0.776,5.2651,4.4805,3.4476,5.0027,0.6997,1.0086,0.3291,1.8778,2.2533,3.5592,4.5175,2.6614,6.4492,1.9081,2.1022,5.4591,4.5396,1.678,3.6017,0.8911,7.2526,4.6527,3.7904,1.3061,1.6636,4.7529,3.0425,4.6768,1.5119,5.5302,4.3948,1.3541,0.6203,4.6091,2.3619,6.6833,3.3959,3.709,4.4139,1.8262,3.5213,0.0397,4.877,3.3207,2.6274,2.0751,2.1522,2.8765,3.2113,3.3182,3.3988,4.3305,1.4886,0.2905,2.5566,3.752,1.3754,2.6109,6.1772,4.4428,5.3493,2.724,3.0062,5.77,7.1596,1.6926,1.636,3.9607,2.1302,4.5341,2.3781,1.9744,2.6807,3.3016,4.8541,5.7115,2.5219,0.5429,4.5301,1.9323,4.5336,1.3427,6.8968,0.3306,5.9555,5.6087,5.793,3.7514,5.8426,6.1671,1.5412,1.085,1.6849,4.348,0.0078,0.7834,5.8063,0.017,0.5039,1.5691,1.559,1.3277,4.8183,2.7758,1.6647,1.6901,4.5316,13.3638,6.5509,2.9141,4.3356,2.4333,0.0006,3.1967,2.6295,3.0063,0.2917,0.7548,1.333,7.3765,1.7257]}

Everyone is living it up in hell, having a good time, then one day heaven finds out about what's going on. Satan is upset & demands to share in your party. He says you're only on earth as long as I deem that you are. God thinks he won't be able to get rid of him, so he sends a doge out to stop him. The doge stops Satan in mid-air, then he turns into a pig, and Satan gets upset & runs away. Well, guess what? The doge has turned Satan back into a guy. It turns out he was a pig before even going to heaven.\nI know where you're coming from. I've never been much of a fan of Manson but I have to say I do agree with you that his \"holy murder \" was kinda sweet. I get he was just doing the best thing he knows how to do, but I do think he has some really awesome lines in his songs, such as when he quotes the Bible and says \"when the pigs fly they just fly, and when the cows bite (knee), They don't know which leg to bite\" and he also says that he would like to be a member of some of his churches. Even when he is talking about someone he really hates, he says that he loves to kill them, \"I like to kill those jerks, kill every single one of them\". Anyway, just saying I agree. Manson is a cool dude.\nI have always thought of Manson's music as pretty cool, and I love his song \"Freakshow\". It is amazing! I wish his message were true. I mean, there are some people in the 'true church of Satan'. I don't have a problem with someone being nice.\nI just wanted people to think that this guy's music was really cool and he had a really sweet message. But like you said, he definitely does have some nasty thoughts.","token_len":417,"entropy":[5.5189,8.9358,2.898,3.2646,1.5168,1.7832,1.561,2.5215,3.6442,6.6763,0.0189,8.5828,3.6,0.0005,2.2625,1.6434,8.1227,0.2365,1.2598,6.97,2.5142,6.3089,5.602,3.1786,3.3519,3.469,1.2645,7.7101,2.4524,3.4555,0.1544,1.148,5.4262,5.6651,0.0681,8.8547,5.7433,0.7174,1.9751,4.5928,1.3152,0.5296,0.0153,1.1941,3.2974,2.2112,5.6228,10.6518,5.6794,1.8914,8.6404,5.3858,3.1776,10.4333,1.4721,1.5813,3.314,2.5442,1.3961,5.1022,5.7808,4.3635,2.8273,3.5366,0.003,4.9716,10.3469,4.7587,2.1627,2.0193,3.8753,4.6975,6.079,2.5924,5.5227,0.0413,2.2165,1.0512,0.0034,3.5153,2.8493,0.001,3.968,1.227,1.4577,0.4803,3.4224,2.2641,8.955,4.4033,5.9372,0.4669,5.3594,0.7528,0.4693,2.653,0.4823,0.029,5.7855,3.5823,4.0934,5.5169,1.3911,0.2209,1.1185,2.845,2.0563,3.8886,3.1423,0.4857,4.7867,1.885,1.6657,2.7063,3.6863,5.8238,2.5136,4.7852,1.0045,0.3804,5.8474,0.5453,6.0431,0.1146,1.2656,3.1006,1.3468,0.0398,3.501,4.7443,5.6868,3.2801,0.2221,0.2547,9.2479,1.6141,4.1111,1.5831,0.0773,1.8384,2.434,2.6699,1.4651,4.2962,7.2427,3.4537,0.5799,2.4132,0.6605,3.2108,6.542,3.777,5.7516,1.1726,1.5422,1.5605,0.0159,1.0981,2.0308,2.6673,2.8138,1.9369,6.1632,0.3871,0.1296,1.9143,0.0734,11.6441,4.792,0.8954,3.2613,1.6184,1.2703,1.5662,4.8439,3.5293,0.3571,1.6859,2.0226,3.6924,4.8181,5.7063,8.2274,7.439,1.4047,6.6396,5.2625,0.5042,1.6734,5.6869,4.3307,1.9959,2.8726,3.5749,2.718,2.9086,1.894,0.9623,7.9608,0.175,0.3256,0.0863,1.5636,1.0302,1.7347,3.5417,1.0857,1.1875,4.4271,1.851,4.4986,5.0449,6.3891,2.3071,2.1139,2.3645,2.4809,3.4254,0.0031,4.0343,0.2784,7.0599,2.0509,2.5059,1.8357,1.1895,1.2588,5.4846,2.1768,7.0868,6.1259,2.7815,6.3394,2.2322,3.8647,1.3337,1.0678,0.4633,4.2421,8.4316,6.4543,6.8857,3.8155,2.0475,8.4279,3.3573,0.0007,5.3214,4.4049,8.6469,2.9875,2.0932,2.583,1.5631,2.4525,2.4664,1.8027,1.5948,1.525,4.0704,2.7682,0.2517,2.8978,1.4851,5.4282,0.0176,5.0274,3.4391,2.283,4.7472,1.045,6.1169,3.5264,0.6641,3.0347,3.562,0.1369,6.9072,2.5168,4.001,4.4904,0.6288,1.0383,2.9554,1.4324,0.728,3.0777,3.2174,2.8921,3.5827,1.7656,5.0466,2.4633,3.3932,0.6785,0.7901,4.2197,7.9653,0.0099,2.2736,5.603,5.3895,2.3206,0.1737,0.7538,0.1544,3.0228,5.6936,0.1989,5.0059,4.7436,3.3187,1.9991,3.9726,5.4541,1.6614,1.4645,5.2993,1.6339,1.3877,1.545,2.1491,3.4432,3.5237,2.6535,2.6423,1.4726,3.325,2.3253,0.1146,5.1008,2.6986,1.2359,2.247,1.1268,3.6729,1.6595,4.2121,1.1941,7.1289,1.0336,3.4673,1.5903,2.0877,2.185,5.6776,3.9999,1.4736,5.2749,5.0054,8.2095,2.724,5.0355,1.5745,1.5001,4.0585,0.4022,3.65,0.9441,1.9478,3.3638,3.2525,0.8778,6.2575,11.0377,4.243,4.1818,1.9293,4.0838,1.7457,2.7474,0.0008,3.9607,1.5965,1.0049,0.0974,6.4628,2.6808,4.6956,3.4409,3.9899,1.5882,3.9991,3.6105,5.7763,0.0578,3.6109,1.507,3.0857,1.7947,3.3436,1.54,1.0578,2.6729,0.8505,1.73,2.7347,2.9137,1.6013,2.2318,5.4893,1.396,1.0573,3.1369,5.3867,3.586,0.1416,0.2421,2.6776,5.3675,4.369,1.2829,0.5435,6.5675,4.9936,1.7092]}
{"prompt":"Two lonely mages individually travel to the woods to summon familiars . They bind to each other instead .","text":"Two lonely mages individually travel to the woods to summon familiars. They bind to each other instead. This way they can help fight and explore. The more you play the characters, the more you can unlock features. There are new cards available for each of the characters. Make them stand strong in the final battle.\nI know this is a pretty generic title, but it is one I love the most. There are a ton of activities including a treasure hunt, a journal section, the main story and side quests. The game is fun, beautifully designed and easy enough for even young kids to enjoy. The visuals are fantastic, and the game is so well made that the only complaint I would have is that it gets really expensive to pay for more pieces. At a young age, I would keep coming back because the experience is so wonderful, but I have yet to find someone who would keep coming back and buying new content once the game has finished its charm.\nThe game focuses on puzzles, exploration, solving scenarios and puzzles, and the exploration of a mysterious castle. The story and the characters are interesting and fun. The story unfolds through journal entries, conversations with NPCs, and the collection of artifacts. As the story goes on, the player will encounter new problems, such as finding the right answer to a puzzle, the right equipment or new items.\nIt\u2019s not a full-fledged action game like other puzzle games on the market that I know of, but it\u2019s good enough to be addicted once you start playing. The graphics are very cute and interesting. It has great soundtracks and music along with many cute animations and voice acting. The story is very interesting, deep, and full of secrets and mysteries.\nI really enjoyed this game. There are many puzzles that you have to solve and lots of areas to discover.

{"prompt":"Most genies take your wishes literally to mess with you . But yours takes everything figuratively .","text":"Most genies take your wishes literally to mess with you. But yours takes everything figuratively. They have my complete respect.\u201d\nIn the year 1752, an elderly gentleman called Daniel Clapp lived in the small town of Amherst, Massachusetts. Amherst was an old seabed town and Daniel Clapp was the town clerk. The day began with a bit of anxiety. He was worried. He didn\u2019t know what to do about the town council\u2019s plans to build what was then a new ferry across the harbor. Daniel knew that he couldn\u2019t be a party to the plan. He wasn\u2019t a true friend of the people. Nor did he want to be. But he couldn\u2019t let the plans get through.\nDaniel lived down the steep hill from the harbor. He had to go out every morning to deliver the mail to the people. He needed to be careful, though. One neighbor had a crazy cat that sometimes wandered into his yard. Daniel was so careful that the cat never came in his yard or across the bridge. But at least he was safe.\nDaniel hadn\u2019t been able to find a new business for most of his life. He and his wife, Emily, had tried to find work in the area for many years. But every time they thought they had found work they couldn\u2019t stand the conditions. So they kept working for some old lady and selling a few things he made. When he had a little more money he decided to build a house. It took several years, but it was done in time for the holiday season. Daniel\u2019s daughter and son-in-law came back to visit during this time. He was so surprised to see them. He had hoped that they would be home from college and would be able to join him on their visit. But they had been working in a big city and decided to have a visit with Daniel and Emily. They were excited to be back, and to see the house they had built.","token_len":417,"entropy":[10.7706,4.4084,6.9429,5.5226,9.5871,6.2903,5.5971,9.1943,0.5362,1.8537,0.9809,3.9245,7.856,5.3705,5.4197,7.8014,0.0199,0.6224,4.9092,3.6289,6.2137,6.3855,3.2458,1.4616,11.7508,9.8624,1.0231,7.7108,1.7939,5.7213,3.2509,4.5183,0.3163,3.9138,5.106,3.3998,3.5624,5.5998,7.106,3.6282,6.4673,0.5391,1.6766,4.1084,0.8512,0.0463,6.6095,1.5908,0.0001,0.5449,0.7984,0.4123,7.1999,0.0182,0.0013,0.8459,3.5326,2.8026,7.2848,2.5212,1.249,3.2664,2.9546,4.7501,1.7447,0.0016,1.1206,2.1839,3.6542,3.8999,0.6438,2.8973,4.9413,6.0753,0.6676,0.8362,6.6472,0.0344,8.1436,1.2294,1.8032,1.5826,4.2851,5.3357,0.9465,3.2016,13.0116,8.6763,0.8915,1.1514,0.9476,0.5482,0.2544,3.0535,1.375,4.5973,6.6062,4.2431,0.5346,1.8484,4.4651,1.3038,3.1929,6.6114,1.7107,3.1015,1.9227,3.8579,6.8575,6.3447,0.2111,4.061,0.623,2.2709,6.3814,1.6306,1.9915,3.4617,0.3253,0.4966,0.0006,3.8435,3.6659,6.8535,1.018,1.4533,1.4072,0.7616,0.8181,4.3626,0.1751,0.2058,0.0001,3.4814,5.779,3.3913,0.9566,0.7905,3.2188,1.002,6.2285,2.1897,0.062,2.2399,0.2647,1.2868,1.0954,3.0838,0.9237,3.9291,0.1861,0.1073,0.0006,3.7143,1.9906,5.284,3.1472,5.3461,0.8757,1.761,2.5109,6.8877,5.0607,0.4564,10.0272,2.014,1.2983,1.0988,3.1677,1.3097,0.7534,2.1873,2.695,3.0047,3.8521,3.8108,1.7932,0.7015,7.5555,1.8617,2.6942,2.1117,0.9116,3.3633,1.4498,1.1341,4.3855,0.7096,2.6441,3.2733,2.9265,3.0584,0.4831,5.334,7.4489,1.7705,2.4745,7.3716,5.3095,1.9512,5.3893,4.1935,2.1792,0.6941,2.2378,0.7726,1.2732,2.5717,3.6603,5.1916,1.1278,3.23,0.5796,3.8884,2.0199,3.4641,4.5768,0.6952,4.1379,5.8476,1.066,5.3194,0.4526,3.3385,4.9371,1.6669,0.9057,1.7997,2.7857,0.3914,1.0963,1.5208,6.3819,0.2615,0.2072,0.0047,1.9294,2.7953,0.0018,3.3881,1.3532,4.3856,5.9956,3.8489,6.366,0.0354,0.5721,0.2457,0.2172,0.8538,4.7256,0.3649,0.6062,2.4107,5.2081,0.2093,0.9738,5.5755,0.6978,2.6787,3.8158,1.5156,1.2631,3.6338,1.7162,3.3848,0.0288,0.5806,1.3516,5.5343,1.4933,0.7482,5.7467,1.8179,2.1329,0.3718,2.0418,2.2273,3.2539,0.0394,0.4136,0.0004,5.4445,1.6513,8.4478,0.731,3.4943,0.784,5.1401,3.0086,3.4859,5.048,5.4066,3.9421,3.5106,6.4214,4.7068,2.5363,2.9387,5.4011,4.0026,1.2968,3.6102,1.9139,3.1698,2.126,3.0409,2.4331,0.4759,1.0922,2.7857,0.3376,4.0439,0.4677,2.146,1.7194,3.319,3.4869,4.5617,0.997,2.289,0.2095,2.4867,0.9667,2.9664,2.405,2.4391,0.9023,1.2638,3.8144,0.3647,0.2154,2.4989,5.0962,0.0201,3.0019,4.474,3.042,2.8151,2.0844,0.001,0.006,0.0013,3.6023,2.9451,1.1305,2.164,6.4967,2.8839,0.1131,0.4742,2.7266,2.3208,1.8512,5.2669,2.3524,0.6541,1.0015,1.017,1.7978,2.3244,4.3039,1.1691,1.3379,0.1937,2.0817,4.2887,5.5669,4.6774,2.0237,3.7761,1.5174,0.7261,0.0023,5.0476,0.7317,2.0927,2.6998,5.8516,0.3112,1.1167,1.4705,2.0258,1.9223,5.2343,3.2404,2.1573,5.7387,3.7744,1.9234,5.3333,0.4274,5.3548,0.6378,3.7098,1.6643,2.2127,2.4864,0.1009,0.4607,1.9351,1.9382,4.1082,0.9159,2.775,1.6767,3.4023,1.8718,3.1067,1.2442,2.3161,3.6658,1.5027,0.3931,0.2469,0.5767]}

Some of them are far from human experience.\nWhat are they and how do they work?\nHow can a man, with the aid of the LBR, survive in the hostile environment while trying to eliminate the enemy.\nI wrote this episode about what happened after man stepped into the solar system...\nI hope you enjoy watching.","token_len":417,"entropy":[7.9062,4.5975,4.6969,1.1092,3.2111,2.7583,0.0066,0.1308,6.7099,2.1784,5.2719,8.3072,6.9852,0.5807,1.287,0.3039,1.0853,2.4636,6.6747,3.8695,4.3049,3.3973,3.9211,1.3474,5.6197,1.2993,5.1688,3.2107,0.954,1.9333,2.2531,5.6154,0.1276,7.1113,4.2937,4.0854,7.9212,15.4995,1.1649,2.6848,7.0477,6.6877,0.3021,3.5644,4.8108,2.609,2.2957,4.42,1.8231,4.3344,0.7292,1.787,5.5754,0.6777,0.2205,3.1119,4.1775,3.295,1.8929,3.0478,1.4271,6.9084,7.1368,7.3934,0.7629,2.775,10.0609,0.117,5.727,6.9633,5.4276,2.9797,5.5867,1.2269,4.1097,2.0642,3.5423,1.0408,0.8147,4.2559,4.787,5.3714,1.6555,2.8386,6.5448,0.3361,1.2231,4.3945,2.6291,2.2838,3.5873,1.9154,1.1359,0.2112,5.5844,0.3995,0.4084,4.9796,0.9002,0.3882,3.2007,4.2679,0.028,0.2898,0.3676,4.7944,0.8971,3.5242,2.2325,3.209,0.1988,1.7634,0.0401,4.7817,0.5691,6.0249,7.6869,6.2984,6.7555,7.0882,4.9278,5.5151,10.3734,2.8033,5.5835,3.3573,2.3582,2.2444,1.5884,2.8635,1.5722,4.5127,1.695,3.1143,1.204,1.7353,3.9077,1.1883,2.7839,5.9791,2.0069,1.929,2.5739,4.0687,1.069,3.0513,5.6079,1.6738,0.8089,1.7689,2.8326,7.7309,0.2074,2.121,3.5772,5.7239,2.8313,0.9081,4.0661,4.2461,2.9355,0.4115,1.2847,2.1289,2.7763,0.4517,1.3165,2.2827,5.669,1.466,1.4815,2.4903,5.4736,0.4243,3.569,3.5105,6.5476,0.826,1.9078,0.2912,2.1076,1.4315,3.1839,1.8889,2.6384,3.7859,0.874,1.1639,0.6543,5.0387,3.0568,1.2674,4.5922,1.27,6.3451,4.4115,0.8239,5.5775,5.1399,0.3409,0.0459,2.3123,2.9982,2.2517,5.6153,5.8933,1.4371,5.5561,4.1761,0.5741,1.941,2.5911,0.1868,4.1145,1.2639,0.2981,1.8802,0.6855,3.5099,2.483,2.5888,0.8607,2.3224,4.6062,2.2563,7.2747,2.9188,2.9587,4.405,1.0613,0.3961,1.5318,6.968,2.11,2.6103,4.6437,5.3681,0.1392,0.2957,0.0253,0.1061,0.0158,0.0031,0.0014,0.0174,0.0068,3.6676,1.7769,6.0564,9.1854,0.1702,0.0069,0.006,0.0056,0.5654,1.2016,5.5807,0.09,4.1057,0.0166,4.8009,1.4609,0.1051,0.119,0.0105,0.1126,0.1694,0.0104,0.0181,0.0009,0.16,0.0382,0.0209,0.0197,0.0051,0.0701,0.5597,5.4987,4.463,0.7564,0.6654,2.3576,3.6573,0.1752,5.4381,0.3101,3.7943,0.8495,0.4636,3.0228,5.3076,2.1797,2.4317,2.2386,5.4603,2.9294,2.278,2.3193,0.076,2.3662,1.3705,0.5761,3.9738,4.4362,5.3729,3.8365,7.4289,5.3579,6.4167,2.1378,0.666,0.9955,1.9354,4.2463,0.041,8.3452,0.0382,0.0525,0.1029,0.0174,0.0336,0.191,0.0353,0.23,0.0013,0.1733,0.174,0.0185,13.0048,0.0753,0.014,0.0807,0.0396,6.417,0.6164,1.064,0.5109,3.2168,0.0269,0.1345,0.013,0.0029,0.0343,7.5792,3.0468,0.0256,0.0343,2.7332,4.4236,1.2394,0.1888,0.4654,2.9516,0.1467,0.1112,0.068,0.2949,0.22,0.6866,0.0924,0.0095,0.0214,0.0113,0.0019,0.0008,6.5641,0.0186,0.1246,3.9802,5.8619,4.5637,2.8131,4.8709,2.6218,2.3296,5.0089,0.0052,1.8466,1.187,0.1036,0.6492,3.5034,2.7125,1.8535,4.5495,0.701,4.5966,4.2849,0.0331,5.4617,1.4311,2.8426,3.4396,0.3256,3.0114,6.0268,1.4485,5.6136,2.7311,4.215,3.662,2.7735,4.0645,7.5519,1.7484,0.6483,4.755,0.0514,4.7381,0.7714,2.3486,2.6946,0.1546,0.4948,4.7982,2.259]}

However, in the end evil was too strong and our hero was slain... fear not though for he was a Chosen One, not the Chosen One. The Gods created this Chosen One to carry out their will in our world. He will bring good luck to others... he will be able to see things we cannot yet see, he will know what is coming as soon as it is around the corner, he will be there for you in the darkest of places.... he will help you grow up and become the man or the woman you are meant to be.... He is our hero and he will always be with us!\nWhen he is present you get a good feeling,you feel protected, when he is gone you feel it too, the feeling that he is here, however far away he is. It's as if he had taken your mind away. When he's not around you don't feel protected, as if he had taken control...... He is your guide.. no he never leaves you alone for very long as he knows all of your weaknesses better than you do. He is there for you no matter where you are, he is there for you in all your fears, all your troubles... all. He will never leave you and will never fail you!\nThis was a beautiful day to finish my little project, an embellished pillow, one that could be perfect for Christmas (just a couple of short months away) or for a fun little gift.\nIt would also make a fabulous photo prop for holiday portraits.. a bit like a photobooth in the outdoors!\nI had been wanting to make one for a while and this is my debut on my home made pillow. I used all new fabric purchased for my embellished project, a bit over 50 yards for this project... I love it! It is just beautiful (see image below)\nI'm sure this will be my next project too, maybe I'll add a cute little pillow blanket to go along with it??","token_len":418,"entropy":[2.5476,10.5937,3.1014,8.5324,6.1455,4.5098,6.1572,3.632,8.5708,0.5627,7.521,0.8405,6.6469,2.0939,3.3418,4.5979,1.4377,4.4448,0.5164,3.5565,0.829,0.6722,9.1023,2.0318,5.4817,1.2599,1.4724,7.9062,1.0216,1.4849,3.4126,5.048,12.0931,2.1439,6.2803,4.5542,2.7791,2.0214,2.7961,7.3355,0.1445,2.2489,4.0187,2.3498,2.4173,0.0294,3.3511,3.0013,5.4631,5.5354,3.1613,3.1646,0.0582,1.774,4.8963,0.6269,1.0044,1.9613,3.2581,3.8351,0.7099,0.9629,2.5197,2.5625,4.0168,4.1955,3.1407,0.8402,4.9812,3.5948,3.3454,0.3223,3.4853,3.431,0.0146,4.4402,3.875,5.2939,2.8483,4.6577,0.2599,1.7674,2.4419,0.0695,4.6244,1.9855,1.6834,3.8091,5.7044,3.341,0.0027,1.8957,1.4135,5.8889,3.6151,0.2218,2.3006,0.811,0.0665,1.4392,4.4662,1.4944,3.0648,3.3174,1.3951,4.2778,2.0222,2.9165,5.3532,3.4246,0.2262,3.9455,0.526,4.1738,3.0113,1.3811,3.1293,2.3948,3.8314,6.6106,3.0782,0.9436,0.4867,2.9352,2.7155,0.016,0.0786,2.6267,2.7115,2.7659,2.9415,2.4097,1.7908,2.1845,0.6494,2.6375,0.389,1.665,0.9439,4.6475,1.2721,7.872,3.4855,1.7981,6.397,3.7507,5.7711,1.5324,5.016,1.5331,3.3067,8.8757,3.1246,7.3823,1.6616,6.2571,0.9407,0.663,2.8297,0.6633,0.8036,5.0403,3.6184,1.186,3.843,2.5282,2.1345,1.6413,1.2794,2.8973,2.044,7.9113,4.5339,0.4515,1.6834,0.9676,2.5162,3.4517,2.2651,3.7806,0.3829,0.9716,4.5577,4.0916,2.8336,4.125,0.8256,2.8795,3.4545,0.7888,2.6997,3.8367,1.6801,0.9066,3.8729,0.001,1.2242,4.3858,0.9855,4.5467,1.1397,0.6266,3.2751,1.4724,5.5332,8.3759,3.5981,1.3582,3.0235,4.8972,5.8119,5.4449,5.3949,4.132,5.4135,0.5677,2.7379,5.3895,5.7794,0.0399,4.8656,0.8206,3.4439,4.3487,2.2246,1.4414,3.8843,7.7164,0.0942,0.4483,1.5641,0.6696,1.5066,1.6416,4.3876,0.8607,0.1487,4.8489,0.3454,1.7008,0.5614,0.9033,1.3985,1.2488,1.0165,0.6531,0.3814,0.0841,2.9607,3.0495,2.7187,3.7371,1.1859,3.5143,0.9345,4.1724,3.0744,4.3096,7.6036,1.5664,1.8845,2.7504,1.6917,0.1219,3.5531,2.3944,0.7493,5.4204,0.5561,4.1032,0.7172,4.0613,3.8757,1.8037,4.6626,3.877,3.4298,9.0006,1.8169,5.9255,3.1024,2.1049,5.5244,8.7594,0.3921,9.7133,2.6671,4.9277,1.5264,4.3939,1.2682,7.1195,0.2544,6.0898,5.394,4.6563,2.453,3.9597,0.4243,5.6478,3.0544,3.3736,1.8134,1.7113,1.8386,1.6131,6.1431,3.4759,4.2275,1.632,2.7187,3.8688,3.9367,3.0733,2.9039,0.6449,5.3355,7.3567,7.1963,1.2876,7.7868,7.107,5.3197,4.0675,4.4845,2.1711,1.0979,6.5864,2.3479,0.4219,3.8429,1.5913,7.1746,2.9495,0.932,1.7578,3.9585,3.0909,2.6584,0.4654,1.7563,2.58,0.6313,0.7685,0.474,1.745,3.3779,2.2742,2.0941,7.7948,5.5622,1.7549,5.433,3.1689,1.4099,1.0988,1.2458,3.9485,5.0658,6.7779,4.2155,7.8848,3.4538,1.9022,9.3552,0.3615,5.5002,1.4706,4.1813,4.4086,6.6895,3.9496,5.7359,5.3669,2.878,0.5936,4.5623,2.0126,4.2873,2.4071,1.7703,2.3661,1.2417,4.2867,3.9239,5.157,4.733,3.8896,1.3805,0.7424,2.1276,1.5837,3.9144,3.2282,2.9144,1.3054,0.625,2.7623,2.8696,0.7717,5.3593,1.272,4.3705,1.9899,1.2169,2.6821,1.4554,5.2693,1.3551,3.3322,7.6313,1.628,5.7471,1.7321,0.0466,0.8213,5.5687]}
{"prompt":"The First TechnoMage","text":"The First TechnoMage's Song, on the other hand, is the first song to be performed by the original gang in the new series. In this song, the gang's friends are fighting in war. During the battle, the gang runs into a woman named Marie, who says they must help her and her friends. When the members of the gang see the music video, they realize that the video is only about what has happened with Marie. The group members, however, believe they are under attack and that the attackers may become a threat to them.\nThe second song performed by the original gang is the Seventh One's Song, in which it is said that the gang has to go on a job. The members go to the location and find a man named Guns that wants to kill them. They run away while escaping in his car. After escaping into another location, they meet a young girl named Yuko. The gang's friends eventually find Guns and kill him.\nThe third song, Diver's Song, begins with a message to their friends that they must leave and take their own lives because there is no place for them there. They then tell their parents that they think the group will die. When the people finally reach the location of their parents, they find the group has died off after the father and daughter had a fight. However, the friends of the original gang find the body of Yuko.\nThe fourth song, Meteors, was the first song where the gang has all changed. The members of the gang are then on a riverboat on the river. The group meets with Meteors in the river and they try to kill them. However, Meteors become so large that the boat will sink before the group can destroy the meteor. After the other members defeat Meteors, a friend of the group, A.O, has become a member of it.\nThe final song, The End, was the last song in the first season. This special ending concludes with the gang saying they will survive and will come back someday.","token_len":419,"entropy":[7.8412,9.7866,1.8756,8.8268,4.2766,4.8644,7.2253,2.7601,6.2417,1.2236,0.3613,0.0138,0.1133,1.1396,3.0552,2.0892,2.0872,2.0465,1.5154,3.8167,1.4127,2.2326,4.6395,7.6072,3.313,1.705,6.1861,3.4693,0.5047,3.445,2.2262,1.5002,0.2093,1.4734,3.1683,3.077,6.62,2.0182,5.6862,3.1936,6.0051,2.1384,4.9678,0.5093,0.8507,0.1972,1.4042,2.2805,6.3065,1.0594,1.186,4.8392,1.626,5.9931,1.6554,0.3578,3.7805,3.3221,3.5346,3.527,1.099,3.2417,1.9761,1.554,1.449,2.8357,1.0974,4.5912,0.6339,0.1117,1.4597,4.799,1.4712,7.431,2.2483,1.0737,0.4661,3.3349,0.7591,1.2348,3.5055,0.8995,4.6837,2.9728,6.007,4.7072,0.2425,4.3491,2.2665,0.914,1.7453,2.6193,4.4636,3.7841,2.0583,0.0016,3.9364,3.2482,1.2894,5.7612,0.7272,1.3187,4.2742,1.3792,5.907,3.9938,7.7609,2.6861,1.223,0.8509,1.9661,0.34,1.7939,10.363,2.8739,0.8209,5.5986,0.2553,0.4002,1.3694,0.6112,0.6832,1.7049,8.5335,5.5771,1.3212,0.2466,0.9089,3.428,0.074,4.3116,0.7644,2.4387,0.2322,1.0001,1.7638,2.376,4.2351,3.3738,2.7057,0.7021,7.8408,2.3789,1.2548,3.1685,4.8538,0.9478,1.3435,5.0604,2.8977,2.3387,1.365,2.3192,1.157,11.6727,7.3054,3.7782,0.5812,2.7239,0.4756,0.4119,2.4031,4.3011,2.4241,4.6465,7.0071,4.1122,3.2278,0.6677,0.7514,2.3086,3.331,5.7044,3.4347,3.6819,0.1934,0.9355,2.8581,1.635,3.3325,0.905,0.1915,7.2626,2.4127,1.3567,2.4273,1.9373,4.6517,2.3526,5.9932,1.9252,4.9858,0.8128,3.3229,0.1966,0.3279,1.6342,0.9731,1.9456,0.193,2.6364,12.599,3.6532,0.4486,0.1014,5.4324,1.201,1.5602,4.7852,2.6109,4.1939,0.923,2.1524,1.0147,1.2459,4.1944,3.4553,4.4007,2.4208,3.0091,0.1474,4.5789,3.5286,0.5601,1.1847,3.1119,1.1338,0.4097,2.6908,0.3786,2.8966,2.3363,4.7978,1.6957,4.6565,0.9054,0.5705,6.7307,2.4375,3.096,2.3543,1.9226,1.7918,2.9751,1.3129,5.3932,5.3263,3.6426,0.6405,2.6224,1.2621,2.3346,2.2255,0.5226,0.704,1.7204,2.1829,2.1516,3.1199,3.9933,6.4426,5.2745,2.1753,7.3339,2.6357,2.0818,2.8463,3.3417,2.0579,0.6379,3.8911,0.0277,1.263,6.7042,3.0487,0.242,4.5494,0.1936,3.4699,1.6022,4.7677,0.2554,1.8275,0.0027,2.4868,1.7258,0.7889,0.4315,0.1921,0.3715,8.1761,3.148,1.6262,2.5591,3.6789,2.5537,1.3221,0.6263,5.7496,0.5514,1.4636,3.2961,6.4191,6.6685,1.3496,1.3135,2.3805,1.2571,0.0642,1.7367,2.2355,5.8396,5.1531,0.6812,8.0541,3.4535,4.3704,1.1357,2.9578,1.3251,1.5437,1.4824,3.3291,3.0665,6.9656,0.0053,0.006,3.2807,1.0713,1.3913,1.3268,1.9514,4.6114,0.0785,4.0365,3.3188,0.4284,1.9524,0.0442,2.8293,0.003,0.0013,9.8543,4.8401,7.1931,0.319,1.5855,2.4713,5.1481,2.218,5.4135,1.9329,1.0613,0.2889,5.5346,1.8103,11.1515,0.9521,2.6596,1.188,6.2003,0.6294,5.172,0.8728,0.0021,0.0009,0.2487,4.226,7.0115,0.41,0.2107,1.593,2.271,5.0821,4.0039,2.735,4.4526,5.1162,4.4075,2.1716,1.5909,0.1491,7.3916,0.4661,1.0796,0.6642,4.4348,0.1263,0.4745,2.5532,4.8068,1.2955,1.1965,0.8192,1.2394,0.213,2.8716,0.1613,3.6147,1.4482,1.0279,3.8143,6.9214,4.1237,6.5246,0.9197,0.6872,1.8719,6.0789,3.0363,1.364,5.7045,2.1747,4.464,4.0322,0.5584,5.8971,0.2982]}
{"prompt":"You receive an invitation to a party at a beautiful Spanish villa .

Upon entering the ballroom you see, not a group of dancers as you expect, but a single fox staring at you. From what you hear, her owner is searching her for a mate. She may choose to put the fox under your tutelage and you get to choose the dance style to be taught by the fox.\nThe two play the game of \u201cwhat you like\u201d. Each question has a certain probability of a correct answer. Thus, if you choose the question \u201cHow many birds there are in the sky \u201d, your best strategy will be to use the following order : 1- ask the question, 2- ask the question again, and if needed, try to guess on your own.\nIn the following section we review the results for two classes of dynamic games played with one of two strategies : an informed strategy, which is known throughout the game, and an uninformed one.\nThe case of two strategies is one of our main results, i.e. we characterize the game with a given payoff function and with only one strategy in terms of a unique payoff vector of the game with two strategies. This characterization generalizes the main result of [GSW04] in the case m = 2. By applying the characterization to the dynamic game we introduced in section 4.1, we show that, in its most general form, the game is a dynamic game played with an informed strategy. Using the same characterization we generalize a construction due to [GSW04] and use it to derive a result concerning non-transferability of perfect dominance strategies (Definition 2.11).\nIn section 5, we consider games played with two strategies. In particular, we describe the class of games which can be represented by a continuous function P (x,u ). We can formulate the following existence theorem.\nAs an application of the characterization, we show that the game with the functions defined in examples 5 and 6 corresponds exactly to the dynamic game introduced in section 5.1.","token_len":420,"entropy":[8.2524,2.9107,4.1443,0.0805,3.3653,3.5567,2.9492,2.8159,7.8375,7.5705,3.388,0.0064,1.9807,6.3444,1.4242,1.1115,7.9197,0.1525,2.1307,4.1802,5.9043,5.2953,3.1768,7.4595,0.1499,3.3758,6.6508,0.8405,2.9284,0.32,0.7418,0.9652,4.7037,8.9794,5.5039,1.1594,0.2777,1.1015,5.5392,4.042,0.984,2.6974,0.9038,5.2257,6.0324,1.1824,7.9639,3.9849,1.5097,1.4984,3.1195,0.5528,3.034,5.5691,5.5921,0.743,5.5353,2.7702,1.0865,5.0339,2.9566,6.613,0.006,0.0002,2.6785,3.776,4.7361,0.9339,2.6303,2.6388,7.0106,5.0999,4.2066,2.528,5.7135,2.1364,1.4876,0.7054,0.5582,2.3816,5.4413,5.4181,6.5487,2.6988,2.9796,0.9859,14.1733,6.3351,7.9216,2.939,4.4094,1.6842,7.3777,2.4636,3.7299,8.9415,3.4952,1.086,5.117,3.1734,2.1352,3.6109,3.1499,0.0305,0.7314,6.6046,0.6178,2.3871,0.7271,2.7648,1.1998,4.9127,5.2485,1.0642,5.6833,1.996,4.6919,6.7597,0.0891,1.7679,0.7428,3.9246,2.7945,5.6276,4.6634,2.8673,4.7454,7.8141,2.3525,0.0735,0.2562,4.5547,1.1473,4.7714,5.2302,6.5706,2.4537,3.5037,11.185,1.4957,0.9943,2.2444,1.0689,0.0575,1.6152,0.3957,0.4634,2.984,0.6378,2.5697,6.0652,6.6595,0.5071,7.06,1.1503,2.7326,6.2095,3.6827,1.5031,0.7579,1.2578,3.4364,1.2444,4.1128,4.3007,1.975,6.8883,0.9522,6.0068,3.8889,4.6709,5.4161,0.7053,10.4321,3.3682,4.1702,2.4948,3.3821,2.9032,2.8918,4.2458,2.6298,5.3214,9.0106,4.1897,2.6349,2.6476,1.606,5.2423,7.1242,0.5604,2.3697,1.4157,0.4136,1.6794,5.3597,0.1192,2.4426,0.9426,0.8273,1.7785,8.5555,0.6835,4.3913,4.4191,1.3834,4.6024,0.3721,6.4385,2.3167,6.9265,2.4529,5.9855,0.0087,0.0028,0.6807,2.8541,9.3069,1.2253,2.8623,3.0798,1.9586,4.9959,8.1837,4.7702,2.4143,4.2966,5.0218,0.9083,3.7608,3.3127,6.495,0.0033,3.5467,6.8291,2.2941,6.6309,4.0481,1.9299,3.0633,5.3306,3.0524,2.0069,0.5726,3.2353,8.5443,9.1243,0.0146,2.3566,4.9383,3.6719,0.8789,7.7082,10.2663,5.1158,6.4102,1.4832,2.9591,1.8917,3.6645,11.2365,2.5975,2.4979,1.7913,6.3947,3.9962,1.1851,9.7334,1.8965,0.8423,6.453,0.6355,3.0261,8.8022,2.4399,5.6535,2.666,1.6717,1.688,0.8643,0.4427,3.2593,0.4769,3.4559,1.8483,6.1498,3.9322,2.2206,0.3678,0.1038,1.187,1.7773,1.4929,2.1089,2.3274,0.3778,4.0445,1.074,3.4071,1.9719,0.3136,0.8892,6.1611,0.9673,3.3399,4.6834,1.7948,8.4914,0.3986,4.3656,8.7775,9.0336,0.0344,2.3246,0.5561,0.0069,0.7709,0.1989,2.6336,4.6666,0.6141,0.6653,4.7826,1.3661,4.822,7.1328,7.242,0.354,9.7072,1.8963,1.2246,11.7604,9.9687,5.1291,3.2501,11.2115,2.5013,0.8109,4.474,1.0883,0.7295,2.1899,5.5144,1.7032,1.8607,0.1774,4.0086,7.5358,2.7128,0.6389,1.7421,1.5251,1.5873,1.7078,4.3636,0.2533,0.6792,3.2612,0.9716,6.6193,0.292,0.7221,3.0433,3.1987,0.2169,4.9904,1.125,1.9976,6.6849,3.4566,7.1019,2.6294,4.7159,1.166,8.6472,6.3322,2.3193,4.5116,5.6867,1.0784,2.3645,9.3569,5.2117,3.3882,1.1664,4.4823,3.6587,5.9914,0.4767,1.0575,6.5444,1.686,0.8695,3.0779,0.3436,1.6704,1.6642,3.7494,1.8844,8.6846,6.1752,0.7204,10.3354,3.4213,0.6721,0.1604,5.5968,4.7269,0.2606,0.5933,4.1779,0.1533,8.1752,0.1377,1.7921,1.7706,0.4472,5.4342,0.4136]}

This is a good way of clearing your memory if you are feeling lazy.","token_len":420,"entropy":[4.7924,2.1967,5.2785,5.6828,1.3546,5.0612,7.4229,2.1035,2.7614,3.3015,1.5124,4.9215,3.6728,2.2047,1.4859,0.5774,3.5649,1.338,6.2969,6.4393,5.0719,6.6138,3.7566,4.1913,1.2206,2.5593,5.1586,1.5757,3.2259,3.974,4.1526,1.6211,6.5891,3.8278,2.2234,2.5414,1.5543,3.3031,3.4223,5.3199,6.6247,1.7132,0.1183,3.4812,3.0523,2.9271,1.1693,4.0303,1.2427,1.6066,3.7949,3.1676,12.7862,3.6295,1.9738,7.2995,1.0446,3.6656,1.9321,3.7366,0.4108,6.9704,2.2726,4.3745,1.3532,1.4799,0.9649,4.0659,6.0467,4.8004,1.4118,1.3943,4.3821,5.5008,1.6274,1.7066,1.3709,5.4878,0.3277,5.0773,1.4569,0.6383,1.4954,2.7937,2.8754,3.1872,5.7978,1.2826,0.7112,2.4641,2.7863,5.0411,2.1932,4.5668,5.1496,5.897,6.4969,0.2861,0.1807,0.6797,4.2676,2.0551,0.0543,0.3595,0.6523,3.1647,3.5734,0.687,0.0908,7.1608,2.0373,4.8735,3.7743,0.0616,6.8583,1.622,2.0293,5.009,0.6414,4.4447,2.3646,4.3251,0.6495,3.9462,0.6085,3.3016,1.4915,4.792,2.391,0.2056,1.9548,1.8421,4.2248,5.9415,1.8255,5.6091,4.1451,4.0956,2.2969,4.8585,1.628,1.7038,4.6702,6.1789,2.973,0.6538,2.7851,0.6376,2.0969,0.3224,2.612,2.1337,2.7993,3.7254,1.0514,2.4848,1.4848,0.2132,2.6606,3.2213,3.7803,3.1514,2.4307,4.5094,6.2691,5.3246,1.4762,2.4517,1.387,0.3396,6.5011,3.4581,2.343,4.2427,7.5955,0.9492,2.5945,2.2644,0.3406,0.3917,2.2114,6.3787,2.2355,2.0961,5.2178,2.3446,1.6788,4.3386,2.2183,2.4293,2.8631,3.5133,5.3381,0.4439,2.8804,3.501,0.7275,0.3752,0.8484,1.8473,5.9708,4.111,0.0198,2.6015,1.2713,2.4113,2.164,2.451,3.7532,2.9777,2.902,5.0324,1.3247,4.4629,2.2334,0.7601,0.982,2.6126,5.9651,0.8218,4.4512,1.0481,5.0512,0.8547,1.2781,0.6546,0.9651,3.6091,3.191,1.7116,5.68,2.9738,0.0078,3.5539,1.1928,8.054,0.897,1.8079,4.0282,1.5798,4.4011,0.497,2.275,4.3553,2.4866,3.4508,2.6363,2.3862,1.357,1.5878,1.7484,2.569,3.5793,4.2903,0.2873,4.3365,0.5451,0.3554,0.1562,2.0569,4.0982,0.9342,1.6877,3.8699,3.6057,1.9281,0.1098,1.8129,3.0755,8.1998,2.806,1.4289,4.8607,1.5777,5.287,0.9145,2.0524,2.1456,2.0444,6.5855,3.4278,1.013,3.6145,5.7578,0.6712,3.8347,0.1608,3.6028,0.3633,0.2089,4.6839,0.9004,4.8238,3.8538,1.6244,6.4987,2.008,1.7449,0.9883,3.551,2.4984,0.7144,6.1967,1.1085,5.1655,1.6134,4.791,1.1787,2.6505,3.3213,0.1405,0.5539,3.6903,2.0687,5.0443,7.2088,1.0554,0.0271,0.1733,1.7473,5.573,3.2621,0.9164,7.6825,0.2593,7.7773,4.3732,3.7158,0.8077,3.3812,2.7855,5.1933,3.6942,0.7416,1.6797,1.335,0.5175,1.995,5.3869,0.6993,4.8631,1.3938,2.9371,1.3305,0.9191,0.9345,5.8504,0.9528,4.5032,3.3671,3.7336,4.3469,4.5572,5.8662,5.6541,2.3543,4.4862,4.6881,3.2729,2.6186,5.112,5.6656,4.6657,2.152,5.5378,1.3788,0.4832,3.7586,0.1498,2.8212,0.0008,1.2362,0.1742,2.0626,1.79,5.8917,1.398,6.3279,0.3656,0.8728,0.2097,4.7057,4.8138,1.7715,6.7745,2.197,1.0819,2.7443,0.5494,0.2759,0.4749,2.7949,0.4158,5.3962,0.7246,1.6172,5.096,3.3951,4.7957,0.8426,1.7071,1.6569,6.9073,0.848,3.8986,1.8061,2.4691,2.6777,1.3174,3.9907,4.0808,3.6338,3.4597,3.3531,0.1372,2.0409,4.8847,2.4277,0.7183]}

He says that he is going to change human history. Now the king asks him what was that thing which he had taken from the lab? The alchemist says he had not put it anywhere. The king just thinks no such thing and asks the alchemist to go back and say the same thing on the next day. The alchemist is happy and asks the king. How much time do you want me to wait and go back to your time to say this? The king replies I would like a day, but I want you to tell me how much you got change from the book? The alchemist replies, \u2018 nothing.\u2018 The king would rather kill him rather than believe his word, and he is ready to kill him. The alchemist runs back to his time to tell the king just that. He has 20 minutes to say the same thing, and if he did the king will kill him. The alchemist turns back and is amazed that he had only had 20 minutes to tell the king just that. The king thinks he has lied, so he kills the alchemist and gives the book to someone else.\nThe alchemist said that there was no thing. he could not read the book. Now someone goes and reads the book. \u2018 You are a liar \u2018 He says, but how did you have that idea. He says, so you read the book and saw he was writing this all down in the year 2000. then your mind said to you that you had gone to the past, you were just like that and had seen this. But the book actually is written in the year 2000. The person thinks nothing happened, and takes the book with him. He goes back to the king but he is gone and there is no book left. Now the king is a person who never gets upset. \u2018 So now, I am dead and the book has been published but nobody has heard of it. \u2018","token_len":421,"entropy":[11.4159,7.1588,0.5434,10.1369,2.5271,2.1973,0.8776,9.8874,1.4361,7.1023,1.2948,5.2912,3.7164,4.7523,6.9804,4.0154,8.0204,2.5553,4.4866,4.1982,4.3378,3.0989,2.1634,1.0352,0.0343,6.2987,8.7607,1.2641,2.9408,3.8711,1.0841,1.4544,2.673,3.5595,0.1965,6.0787,7.5272,1.2543,2.2406,5.0861,3.0583,2.7295,4.8224,0.7384,2.2068,4.7511,3.289,3.5105,4.3763,2.3003,2.7687,6.2586,1.2929,1.1832,7.1839,3.3047,2.8854,1.9957,0.017,1.4581,2.2423,1.3299,4.1663,5.597,0.6944,5.0381,2.008,1.5203,0.1328,6.9133,4.254,6.5176,4.6023,0.0505,3.5502,2.8189,3.1293,0.7522,0.0066,1.4501,3.12,1.3709,1.5088,3.8751,3.1914,1.9602,0.2291,5.5109,1.0469,2.778,0.5351,0.3223,1.5111,0.7074,0.0038,2.8935,4.7037,1.6569,2.9237,1.5146,0.1294,4.8477,6.667,3.6807,1.6271,2.3266,0.3055,3.017,3.3933,0.0682,3.8659,3.2337,4.324,0.3854,0.996,3.1007,3.31,4.3946,3.291,2.099,0.8007,0.7699,0.1477,2.6962,6.3909,2.5504,2.4994,3.008,3.1269,2.7561,1.7205,1.4298,3.5791,1.8128,0.1366,2.8794,0.3794,2.4763,1.0174,1.6932,6.1838,9.2577,2.3452,1.0956,7.1768,4.5762,0.7748,0.7039,0.0029,2.753,4.8991,12.819,8.1871,8.3664,1.8215,4.6964,1.6281,2.5573,0.1945,6.2955,3.4242,5.5659,2.758,4.6685,0.0766,5.8987,3.162,4.1918,2.2746,2.32,1.9484,2.7706,3.7577,0.3295,1.542,1.2802,0.9814,1.2287,1.0681,0.0032,6.9048,2.6,0.4245,0.8553,1.8424,2.5574,1.6193,0.7495,0.2122,7.0527,2.7953,0.9906,2.3274,3.0786,6.0922,0.1684,1.6169,2.502,1.5623,0.2828,0.2383,2.207,1.4133,4.047,0.7362,3.5127,4.1152,1.383,1.149,1.9731,0.0649,0.6714,0.9218,1.3976,0.0042,5.3432,2.3409,1.5662,4.2123,4.2657,2.4602,1.0852,3.13,3.3308,4.4549,0.6896,0.0837,2.167,2.2034,0.5852,0.1124,5.2768,0.3718,0.2514,1.1019,0.3355,3.7763,1.4817,1.7223,5.9894,1.6452,2.9193,0.3532,5.2259,1.2967,0.1905,0.0025,1.4293,3.3434,1.2002,3.5432,0.3891,6.3966,0.4342,0.3544,2.2968,5.4478,2.5813,0.0091,5.6631,1.335,3.9798,1.7235,1.708,5.347,3.1186,5.723,4.3309,1.215,5.1556,1.2991,0.6432,1.4232,5.0092,5.9927,6.1971,1.9121,2.475,0.8547,0.308,1.3552,6.2721,0.5943,4.5975,2.3644,3.106,3.8567,6.194,0.0285,5.5945,1.9449,2.3811,5.3107,4.9595,2.3088,0.4171,4.622,3.1284,5.7638,3.1843,2.0378,1.5251,1.7813,4.5241,1.4623,4.5122,1.0384,0.1097,1.4408,5.4159,6.3726,1.373,4.4985,3.677,6.4848,3.8941,2.6927,1.9097,7.0204,3.1202,0.5649,7.8402,5.5788,3.7487,4.7399,3.1152,1.1624,2.2128,1.4495,2.3898,5.2171,1.7214,1.4283,3.9873,1.7499,2.2659,2.4834,4.3662,4.2611,1.9397,2.5098,4.4947,4.4621,2.5827,2.4556,3.912,2.7534,2.2452,6.2836,3.8273,3.1995,0.9159,1.2036,0.485,0.1621,0.9138,2.5326,5.6785,6.264,5.2378,5.4092,1.7683,1.6221,6.2318,0.7629,0.3505,3.3651,0.22,0.877,1.9868,2.7751,0.8714,0.3862,1.4902,5.3861,5.3225,2.0423,1.7672,4.6638,2.6607,3.065,0.329,0.8624,2.9793,2.0758,0.5632,3.5584,1.1607,0.6002,2.3777,4.5361,6.2059,0.9106,5.0842,5.1534,5.6102,1.5362,3.7472,0.0253,3.385,2.8924,3.8684,3.5513,1.7478,4.8613,1.8113,2.7715,1.5567,2.6388,1.3122,6.0553,4.7436,4.8597,1.97,2.9312,0.6079,1.4721,0.5668,3.4794,0.0077]}
{"prompt":"We believed they were stars . They weren \u2019 t .","text":"We believed they were stars. They weren \u2019 t. No point in living, in this place, I guess.\nSo I tried to get on my feet again, my mind and my heart, and I remembered. It was a beautiful afternoon on the river, a gentle river from a beautiful land.\nWe were a quiet couple, not bothered about people. It was a pleasant spot, but as time went by it became crowded. There was a bar across the street, on the other side of the river, with a sign out front saying, \u201d If you have good whiskey, we have good people.\u201d\nIt was a good bar, not expensive, but it made me think about going there after a long day of work. People stayed there till late in the night, smoking on their outdoor porch. I could smell them from the other side of the river. I made the crossing and walked out, and stood in the crowd.\nI could not sleep. My wife made me some eggs. We had gone to bed with the lights off and my daughter was in her room reading. The sun had gone down over a mile away, the day was gone.\nI got the eggs before the light faded ; it was almost dark in the room. I went back to sleep, not feeling good, but having to lie down, exhausted, tired of lying in the dark. My mind wandered : I was going home ; it was warm and comfortable ; I walked back to the dock, over the cold river, down the trail that led to the old farmhouse. I walked slowly, trying not to lose my bearings, trying to stop the world from moving around me.\nIt was still in the dark over the river. I went to the shed behind the house, and lit up the matches. The porch was dark, but there were plenty of dim lights. This was where we lived. I turned the light off and sat down and began to think again and remember. \u201d We were happy to live here, \u201d I said over and over in my mind.","token_len":422,"entropy":[8.8063,4.4045,0.963,10.5162,1.8043,2.2014,3.8118,18.6727,7.6329,8.8566,5.1268,5.5804,7.3653,0.8659,6.9515,4.5236,5.0144,4.5184,3.5386,1.4743,5.0805,4.8939,0.7785,2.5842,10.2975,1.8778,5.0376,0.5213,2.9395,4.14,3.2163,1.6868,4.6562,1.3894,5.2726,4.1483,3.3619,0.7874,2.2607,1.8346,1.119,1.3326,7.3093,3.4833,3.1732,0.6448,2.3108,3.6796,6.212,4.1904,0.9365,5.3641,1.4401,2.9894,5.1558,4.0335,5.7572,3.5953,4.0045,4.5568,0.8871,1.9432,3.6339,1.9651,5.2996,6.1069,4.28,1.2257,4.4755,8.3659,2.108,4.9513,1.3462,3.0707,0.317,1.7698,3.8402,5.7167,1.3661,2.6681,4.9403,3.661,0.3324,1.1464,2.6861,0.8352,6.0974,0.8288,3.3948,0.8331,1.2698,7.2218,5.4639,0.2961,1.1015,0.9803,5.0261,0.7091,2.736,0.0358,0.1329,0.3226,1.2591,0.9294,3.4035,1.2487,3.5482,5.6733,2.162,1.9593,1.6006,6.5719,8.1301,5.1166,0.3571,3.8454,5.6904,7.8323,0.5995,3.0374,3.3144,1.4235,5.4614,0.9092,5.4195,3.2782,0.8157,3.2697,0.4158,1.6238,2.6539,4.3314,0.6926,4.3405,6.7947,0.8148,0.7548,1.5612,5.2395,1.5941,2.6926,1.3951,5.0325,2.3784,5.445,2.7686,2.1046,0.8576,1.4793,2.1943,0.6479,5.5304,6.6678,2.7906,5.4365,2.9183,2.1236,0.0099,1.4111,0.7048,7.1048,5.022,3.1666,6.6343,3.9917,1.2098,2.1005,3.9509,2.4559,2.7698,3.6474,0.8239,4.6408,0.1368,0.3412,0.0802,0.5604,0.8717,1.9361,5.4458,2.8166,6.8864,2.7983,3.5092,3.5507,2.5383,2.8857,6.5093,1.7731,0.8081,5.2906,1.475,0.8533,1.5613,3.7362,3.4107,4.0362,1.321,3.1932,4.9284,5.4775,0.8216,4.8792,6.9255,1.7806,2.7219,1.8581,4.9088,0.9756,3.3742,3.6153,2.1238,5.1592,1.4413,2.1151,2.7571,4.2367,1.0259,3.0707,2.7142,2.0822,5.4856,1.7055,3.0674,2.8539,2.6014,2.9201,0.1902,5.2298,3.5892,6.524,1.82,1.2144,3.6653,5.343,1.2611,5.3599,0.8302,1.0973,1.321,4.1823,4.2526,4.4688,5.5851,2.1291,3.336,4.4341,11.5665,2.7997,0.4517,4.964,1.1458,2.5982,0.526,3.8291,0.542,1.0771,3.0912,2.0341,0.5203,1.8961,1.129,4.5775,2.9967,3.5647,1.4322,1.2667,5.1235,2.6138,4.9538,0.7999,2.6249,6.7221,1.216,3.4233,3.6551,5.2733,2.5187,1.5669,1.852,0.7168,3.7419,2.0549,3.4697,10.3357,1.7789,2.1465,3.2699,4.3782,5.7047,2.7918,0.355,6.9627,2.0847,3.8287,3.1464,1.0108,5.7494,3.1825,0.4477,1.1235,6.4792,1.333,7.269,0.8625,7.4681,1.6958,1.0077,4.4679,0.8227,6.4036,3.7299,0.774,0.5722,0.611,5.095,3.8009,1.4018,0.8012,1.8749,3.1259,4.0592,1.361,4.0738,2.0528,0.0025,3.947,0.8473,2.2895,1.5607,2.1208,0.569,5.3094,3.2313,6.2139,0.64,2.6549,3.3412,0.776,0.458,0.7876,2.9057,0.3954,4.8955,4.9838,0.7422,2.515,6.4543,0.7545,1.9027,1.1678,1.1778,3.8859,1.5986,1.1769,5.4877,4.5511,0.3716,1.9858,1.0117,1.4096,6.3213,2.1989,0.8032,8.9922,1.037,2.4343,7.0583,0.9502,3.332,0.8356,1.7299,2.4528,1.3668,4.2995,0.0313,6.7841,1.3933,1.1594,5.7991,0.7546,3.378,2.2475,2.9559,1.1007,1.842,4.4212,1.7676,1.7436,1.3026,1.3525,3.4575,0.5764,3.7077,3.6051,0.4883,2.4993,4.5116,4.5099,6.0343,1.112,7.5971,1.491,3.8975,1.329,5.3478,3.0946,2.0972,0.9416,1.1928,6.8286,0.3078,3.1771,3.6064,7.8284,1.3075,0.0006,4.0638,0.5328,0.3561,0.6463]}
{"prompt":"Write a serious story that connects all WP tropes together in one universe .","text":"Write a serious story that connects all WP tropes together in one universe. And be sure to link back to this blog page to be added to our WordPress community. If you are not a WordPress user, feel free to contribute through Blogger and other weblog platforms.\nWonderful to have you here and sharing with our readers your passion for great stories. If you have a question about WP, or are just a fan of the community, post in the thread \u201cWP Q & A\u201d, or in the private forum.\nThe author thanks all the authors for entering their work into his contest. Congratulations to all successful contributors, and a big congrats to the winner.\nHmmm. I thought they were trying my luck and they are. I was just curious as to why someone would participate in a story contest. Mostly because I enjoy reading stories. You know how sometimes you can just sit down and read any old story and its a good time?\nIt\u2019s always hard being the judge of WP stories. The best stories are from the ones we have ourselves contributed. The reader has to think of themselves to imagine what they are reading. They have to know their characters and the setting well enough to be able to judge the character\u2019s perspective. After a long period of time, I had learned to trust my instincts and have tried to trust mine.\nAs we say on this site, we have different senses and a lot of them are used to judge our stories. I had thought that I would be easy to judge, but I have come to understand the way the audience judges is not something that I can take away from a story without having tried to understand it.\nSo the winner of this story contest is \u201cTo Your Gracing, Miss, To Your Honor\u201d, written by Miss Alysson F. Skehan. Congratulations and thank you for entering.\nYou have given me a big smile! I love reading stories. I try not to put myself too much in the story though, because I am trying to see everything in a different way.","token_len":422,"entropy":[4.0641,9.2639,3.94,3.3973,5.9022,3.7787,13.9434,8.8324,2.4457,3.0786,1.6534,7.0571,0.8547,4.7715,5.2628,1.1457,0.0945,4.4571,2.3046,0.1799,1.9318,3.3549,4.8425,2.283,5.1044,4.6138,0.2159,2.5021,7.5151,2.6934,0.7592,3.8369,0.156,2.6388,2.969,2.6698,3.3913,1.614,0.6552,3.6723,0.0012,0.0081,4.1812,5.4342,6.1027,0.7845,2.9803,3.6828,8.9636,0.9935,7.0521,0.5083,0.9817,14.5261,1.6084,4.9542,2.9127,2.2249,2.1625,3.724,3.8034,2.9014,4.156,0.8438,5.2171,4.265,0.5714,5.6788,2.476,1.0122,3.3974,0.1306,1.7244,2.4105,1.8083,1.8114,2.8717,1.8732,2.6147,3.2202,2.6049,3.0782,1.5164,0.2006,1.7666,4.741,0.4992,4.8862,2.068,0.5927,4.234,13.486,8.0614,7.8616,7.5055,3.2019,0.0192,1.9397,7.9421,3.5493,1.1611,4.3567,0.617,7.4287,2.0549,1.4529,1.363,4.1674,5.7649,6.6007,2.5998,3.0134,3.7623,1.4087,8.4357,3.0388,4.7515,1.3868,6.2445,8.0403,0.7572,5.8252,0.7736,1.3273,8.4817,2.933,2.3512,1.0334,3.3371,1.7831,5.5819,0.0096,0.0785,2.0322,3.7181,1.1993,1.0458,6.6704,5.6378,2.1242,2.1813,3.0961,5.1937,1.0069,5.1595,7.4053,1.8789,3.5075,3.7554,3.9257,1.8461,2.2173,3.6067,3.361,2.8413,3.5778,0.132,1.7653,4.7159,1.4873,5.9539,0.4967,1.221,5.5233,3.782,1.7251,8.3054,0.7515,1.1185,5.265,2.416,1.9963,2.0344,5.071,1.7848,2.7746,4.7404,1.7949,3.3967,3.7441,3.4854,2.2266,0.4532,0.9405,5.8307,6.6243,0.9182,1.3197,8.0215,2.8656,2.5479,3.0525,2.3974,2.8075,4.1574,14.6233,6.9166,1.2673,4.8187,4.4084,5.7634,3.4308,5.792,1.6974,6.1089,1.1586,0.739,3.392,3.4129,3.9552,0.9361,5.5142,1.5243,6.5074,3.3547,2.4299,6.4654,7.8783,2.0712,2.9449,7.1267,3.0568,1.2469,4.7634,2.4917,3.59,4.5741,7.5054,1.239,1.4399,1.8996,2.7295,0.8414,3.923,1.0724,0.061,3.9092,3.3012,4.1374,1.251,3.2055,4.6665,5.874,1.7566,0.3357,2.7562,0.5164,0.0076,3.7377,2.0063,5.3035,6.3409,2.6522,0.9326,8.3499,0.8291,6.1819,3.3279,2.6936,3.7981,0.1037,2.1993,0.7428,2.1452,4.0449,5.6355,1.9645,3.5471,1.4934,4.0881,1.2247,4.4735,4.6682,0.5353,5.7811,7.7648,0.566,1.7885,4.3633,4.2052,5.4124,3.2965,3.0499,2.3191,0.2874,2.427,2.9417,5.8861,9.4595,2.5808,4.8489,1.8995,0.1569,3.8118,1.8019,6.0661,1.3232,2.683,3.3208,1.0071,0.2591,2.5694,4.0623,4.2052,1.6039,2.0468,1.1298,1.9238,7.161,0.362,0.2902,1.9202,0.5411,1.139,2.9976,3.3544,0.1412,3.0328,2.9371,4.436,2.6784,3.5806,5.6008,4.5787,3.8116,4.1807,1.2316,2.0667,2.1812,4.774,3.1223,0.2937,2.7866,0.4668,7.1597,3.1592,6.2094,0.935,3.5215,0.9634,0.8447,1.3073,2.966,4.2992,3.3671,0.8928,0.9466,1.9202,0.2215,1.6892,7.4349,0.7018,8.4048,6.5376,6.381,7.5029,3.6627,8.2782,4.0166,6.1623,0.7404,5.3778,1.8445,1.8304,2.785,6.8556,0.0953,5.1211,8.5911,7.0732,6.5373,3.0565,9.545,6.7706,1.223,5.0758,4.0752,3.1369,0.0168,1.341,3.281,1.4258,1.0551,3.4908,2.7535,5.5355,1.7375,1.5619,4.854,3.3025,3.9783,2.0465,3.3594,2.6444,1.0975,1.2715,1.3398,5.4877,2.3891,0.0058,4.4001,1.8536,5.3003,1.0725,2.8485,0.7432,3.5828,5.6923,1.8101,2.0876,0.9989,2.3595,4.2672,0.285,4.3798,4.3587,1.872,2.1499,2.7349,1.1252,0.4129]}

No, it won't happen, so we have created a god that explains it all.\nMy favorite, from my book, is the one about Isaac Newton, when he gets home from hanging out on a high mountain in England and sees an apple falling a couple inches from his fingertips. He had seen it fall enough times to realize it was falling, but when it falls to his fingertips he looks at it and wonders if he will ever again see a apple fall. He concludes he can't know why he had seen the apple fall so many times, and he wonders if he isn't making more sense than he had before. So then he asks the question that all science and intellect and humanity really came back to, and why did we create God.

I believe in the Bible, and in the Bible's teaching that the earth has been in existence for 4000 years...\"\n\"...and the first day of the earth has the number seven days in it - how long was the creation of the universe, then the creation of man....\"","token_len":422,"entropy":[12.2003,3.2166,6.5873,2.7918,3.4879,4.1098,2.1987,8.3428,1.8826,2.4097,3.7445,0.9678,6.1998,0.211,11.0585,0.0536,2.6228,5.3803,3.3003,2.8788,4.7968,0.126,0.9334,10.92,4.6322,10.619,4.5912,1.1554,3.6963,0.6487,0.3178,7.2948,7.3027,3.43,2.4204,1.2157,5.8562,5.1907,4.8406,2.3453,0.1828,1.2668,3.6076,5.0908,8.199,2.9036,6.1668,6.5439,5.0568,5.1668,3.0606,1.6645,6.4366,0.0401,2.0728,4.8316,0.1165,2.2625,1.9593,3.1906,0.7912,1.8589,3.1916,3.6091,1.1732,3.0355,0.2726,2.2103,1.8882,2.7557,2.9103,5.8114,4.5347,0.8762,2.8661,3.2958,5.6635,0.2671,1.6963,0.009,0.0127,0.582,1.7188,6.2907,3.9238,0.0137,0.8457,6.9244,5.1023,7.6592,1.8639,5.0468,0.1508,1.9711,2.1224,5.4865,3.3821,5.0413,4.441,8.2845,1.5767,1.4179,2.2745,5.6221,1.4087,3.1444,4.9357,0.0054,2.143,2.2594,4.3731,2.2998,1.9576,8.9321,1.3089,7.0713,3.1426,6.4359,1.3327,1.9338,0.9205,1.1101,5.1445,2.9209,5.133,5.3874,2.5848,3.8684,1.0247,0.9397,1.7602,2.268,1.3858,7.7074,0.0819,1.5926,4.3862,0.2962,7.3147,5.9664,0.6545,9.8651,0.464,3.1792,1.3308,6.5023,3.5511,1.6911,3.7853,1.7141,3.4769,3.1009,4.6333,3.9433,6.3141,3.2356,3.8847,2.0933,0.5356,7.3467,0.3064,1.5601,5.1386,4.2034,1.3296,2.9171,7.6445,0.1667,1.6354,2.9694,1.4792,0.5217,4.5276,2.6814,1.7779,3.6815,2.7568,5.7368,3.7229,1.6247,2.3323,1.9036,4.4544,1.4576,0.6308,0.9449,4.5358,1.6157,1.685,4.8941,0.9294,5.233,0.9062,3.3357,2.3458,1.7762,1.0675,2.1431,6.009,3.4926,3.0876,0.634,5.8655,3.7627,2.0517,4.4064,1.3699,2.4389,0.5174,0.9814,2.5126,2.0128,0.0469,0.9358,1.8338,1.856,4.3061,0.9742,0.8601,6.3659,0.0007,5.1456,4.3237,1.6156,2.5312,0.8515,5.0928,2.7772,0.4725,3.7612,4.6693,0.7456,3.4383,2.4255,2.0164,3.5025,4.4871,4.0466,3.5486,8.4619,3.9831,5.4938,5.1013,10.5081,6.6453,0.5719,2.5942,2.416,5.1025,2.4237,1.9806,4.0722,5.9486,2.4663,5.0763,3.308,2.5291,1.1498,4.7453,4.0376,4.2105,0.708,5.0361,4.6866,2.227,0.8395,4.1922,6.5306,3.7495,2.7471,2.2851,0.5083,0.8146,4.1617,5.0274,3.5484,0.9346,4.8789,2.3088,0.9648,4.1508,0.7282,1.5042,5.365,0.0015,3.6257,1.6862,1.5703,4.0511,1.4131,0.478,2.9949,0.0752,0.8037,3.2461,3.7539,6.5508,3.8371,1.6726,5.2166,5.4077,2.638,4.5925,2.2246,2.4994,5.9783,6.2102,0.1686,2.4104,5.8822,9.5758,2.9516,5.9335,6.7936,3.866,6.535,2.4367,7.0812,4.3957,2.6558,6.6899,0.0006,3.7221,1.3818,3.7495,6.376,5.4856,10.6928,0.9436,0.0429,0.6381,4.4542,1.4022,1.3702,5.9219,0.3073,3.1377,5.11,1.7849,4.3526,3.8889,2.3244,4.1471,5.5525,4.5028,1.8752,3.6788,1.6069,3.1304,4.5726,0.7526,2.7949,0.1391,1.6372,1.1487,0.1328,6.3219,1.49,1.5314,7.9723,0.9356,0.3908,0.3355,1.2961,8.7727,3.4522,2.734,1.9007,1.7311,3.7355,1.7907,1.2125,3.3124,1.0383,2.0045,4.0062,2.8848,1.4897,2.1042,2.4068,3.2103,1.2655,3.8442,2.6668,0.3215,1.957,0.0944,4.4876,0.4936,4.1066,4.2415,2.3671,4.1023,1.0531,1.0617,0.5861,4.8817,2.9479,6.229,4.5836,6.9426,2.851,3.8459,1.1244,5.0074,5.359,3.0963,3.81,1.35,6.6842,0.4842,0.447,1.5784,2.3954,2.9572,4.3809,3.018,0.0509,2.79,6.2274,1.5615]}
{"prompt":"Weird World Wednesday , # 3 !","text":"Weird World Wednesday, # 3! You may remember I reviewed Trixie's # 4 and gave a second round of love with # 5 last month. This one is all # Trixie and # Cat. # 5 is a short one with lots of cat and a few dogs. I liked this one well enough but this will have to be next.\nWhen you say you want a # Divas series, I am so intrigued! There was one # 4 and it got so much better from that point on. I hope you enjoy it!\nI like your rating so far and this sounds a lot like our current favourite series. It did have a good beginning but then the cat disappeared. Sounds like a fun one though so will be on my to read for the weekend.\nAfter a wonderful vacation in southern Thailand, we had planned on the trip home to a lot less time on the road. The idea was to spend a night or two in Chiang Mai, Thailand before we flew back, and then visit family. That has changed based on the news reports from northern Thailand where the government of the State of Shan in northern parts of Burma, has been fighting to regain the control of several areas that the insurgency has taken over.\nOn a trip of this magnitude, even with the many travelers we have encountered who are not taking any type of action to make the world a better place, and a few others who are just trying to get along, it\u2019s not easy. Having said that, I don\u2019t think that taking a stand, as a traveler for your own protection or that of others, is a reflection of being politically or morally immature. This trip has proved that many young people are willing to take on the world and its problems in order to better themselves and their community. The problem we face isn\u2019t one of \u201cwe need to band together to solve our problems\u201d but instead one of \u201cwho gets what and when.\u201d And at a young age, many people aren\u2019t able to make those difficult decisions.","token_len":422,"entropy":[9.7087,5.5369,12.4322,3.0891,6.731,10.3295,6.2457,5.2744,3.3736,3.2951,4.8664,7.3207,10.1,2.1445,0.2817,1.9273,5.8346,6.0219,3.6895,6.9987,2.8035,5.9015,3.4438,1.3795,7.4401,6.0206,3.1279,2.6185,3.8542,2.9812,0.7091,3.5557,3.8034,1.4776,4.5533,7.5849,7.7239,0.0528,0.046,3.1461,2.1685,7.6421,2.3054,3.6717,3.6639,1.1795,2.1443,6.659,3.7194,2.8866,4.0405,0.0897,5.6293,3.8844,4.1586,3.0565,4.7613,0.8722,2.0752,5.4903,2.9037,0.7123,5.3319,0.9177,3.9035,4.0881,5.7321,3.6179,0.3047,1.6536,7.5126,3.2925,1.85,8.2951,2.2825,4.7114,3.2422,2.5298,2.0542,3.0715,11.5217,2.3844,5.4931,0.6506,3.1197,3.7436,5.0035,6.863,2.022,4.2301,3.5536,3.1979,6.1146,5.2271,2.4653,2.7595,4.2425,4.1208,1.8227,2.9394,4.1769,4.3996,3.3505,0.394,0.6654,1.6652,4.3978,1.2838,2.3537,1.4632,1.6486,1.0334,2.6518,4.3158,4.1882,8.3944,3.5394,1.5464,2.1496,4.6102,8.8981,4.3764,0.9176,0.5187,5.2571,4.6235,6.9124,1.3774,1.0164,2.9056,5.8207,3.1238,1.2953,3.7999,4.9508,1.2064,2.3336,2.5456,7.2931,6.31,1.5237,7.4987,0.5117,1.7814,4.784,3.6371,4.4873,3.9229,5.3963,2.0614,4.3071,2.2564,3.0645,3.0634,3.7733,2.2821,4.8655,0.5329,0.884,5.6923,2.6634,5.5023,7.2831,2.9836,7.2431,5.0717,0.8588,2.7025,3.4375,5.7914,1.6335,5.4912,2.509,4.2758,1.4994,4.2607,5.4093,6.6079,4.3185,3.4483,1.0415,1.9477,0.7975,3.2935,5.5063,0.8972,0.4322,2.9348,1.508,3.7859,3.7591,0.3253,1.5207,6.0431,0.2062,0.0604,1.9678,3.3051,3.8345,2.2848,5.2734,1.3261,4.7492,2.3112,1.2017,4.7862,5.1696,2.0459,4.0655,5.2095,4.6083,7.8585,0.0311,1.3618,4.3915,4.7308,2.8405,7.9084,0.096,4.8659,1.9989,5.6715,4.3269,1.7793,7.0432,0.2238,8.1261,5.0677,4.1287,6.9285,0.0864,4.8268,3.931,1.9634,2.2244,4.0269,2.5561,3.9999,2.485,3.5263,0.2855,6.6912,2.4491,3.6953,3.0542,6.7548,1.2737,2.3349,0.7285,0.3408,1.5803,3.7226,2.917,3.2123,3.7573,2.5733,2.5629,0.6161,6.8975,2.774,1.4789,5.6474,6.2732,2.902,1.6824,6.1166,4.416,2.0444,3.1827,6.9305,2.4246,6.3651,0.0062,5.1851,2.1765,4.4631,2.2213,4.8527,0.6838,0.2433,0.005,0.3585,4.1857,4.4844,2.4841,4.1585,0.3892,1.1047,2.8501,2.6506,0.0987,1.9132,4.3764,1.0226,1.8075,17.1819,7.4013,1.3581,2.9398,3.2454,1.1892,6.1288,2.0674,0.1571,0.1473,1.2954,3.7863,1.9517,1.4041,0.1389,1.3255,2.4146,6.7652,1.5158,6.8706,4.682,4.1053,2.8576,5.8747,5.676,5.0567,1.5492,4.1018,2.6505,5.1811,0.1609,1.034,0.9624,0.5108,1.9639,9.4928,0.2558,5.4694,7.0092,3.7464,2.8298,6.8596,0.4948,3.8767,4.4028,2.5398,5.9837,1.315,4.9477,5.3953,0.6325,1.8542,2.053,0.0423,1.7451,2.0921,1.4085,2.9831,1.9529,4.6842,2.735,3.1714,2.1208,0.0268,4.6338,1.0362,1.2752,1.3349,3.3751,0.4159,3.5672,5.0183,4.3421,1.1049,5.1271,0.3703,0.6533,0.0271,4.6521,0.8057,10.9862,3.9316,7.0658,4.5964,0.4359,8.6338,0.0453,1.3598,2.8151,2.8179,0.3269,1.072,7.0372,1.5244,3.1039,3.5031,0.3965,1.9171,0.1361,5.8622,5.9549,5.2939,4.4845,3.4402,1.4344,5.7409,4.7167,4.5404,5.7501,3.1791,4.6961,0.0122,0.8407,4.1958,2.8308,4.8548,0.0692,0.7522,0.0037,3.0009,0.0318,3.4444,3.9329,5.0646,0.565,1.1818]}

In the letter, explain exactly what your futures will look like. Explain your hopes, dreams and ambitions. What are you looking forward to doing, where do you like to live, what work do you want\nThe one who is the most important (by distance) in your heart, but you still have an ambivalence about the relationship. Here is where your heart is. Let your beloved know how you feel about him\/her. However, try to stay away from situations where you have too many feelings for your beloved, and then it will be even harder to let go.\nTell him how much you wish to be with him\/her and tell him the one thing that you want more in everyday life: to live with him\/her. Give a list of all the places and things that you like to do together, including your favorite places that you are sure to love. Tell him how much he\/she was an important factor in your life and how it changed you.\nHe\/she has moved on, and now you want to make peace with life without them. The pain they left behind is still unbearable. However, you just have to get over your feelings and look towards the future. This will help you in overcoming your fears, getting over the pain, overcoming jealousy and regaining your confidence.\nWhen you start getting over your feelings for your ex, you can think about something new. Don\u2019t be afraid of the idea of starting or improving a relationship with a new person. Try to remember all the good times you and your ex spent together. As time goes by, you will become more tolerant of the new person and start to accept it.\nNow that you are over your feelings for your past, take a break and give yourself the opportunity to think things through. In addition to your ex, others around you are also important. When you are in a relationship and have a family, it is vital to protect your children. You have a new life.","token_len":423,"entropy":[6.3872,6.1406,1.9482,4.1432,0.8776,2.8632,8.9097,8.6615,8.5325,5.7282,0.1473,12.375,9.7761,6.6235,3.9504,5.4066,6.0582,2.9316,1.6623,0.975,0.8414,4.7095,1.6018,1.2317,0.6954,7.5411,5.6835,0.4864,2.4911,7.8276,2.0185,2.1084,0.0017,0.9502,4.6628,2.9952,5.6921,1.1796,1.5138,1.7555,3.5335,0.6853,3.0129,2.6907,1.8968,2.0781,1.1304,0.0257,2.2732,3.5046,4.184,2.4972,0.0252,5.9315,0.1566,1.5544,0.8644,1.2404,5.8032,2.2262,0.0053,0.8025,10.9381,7.3641,3.616,2.476,2.5312,2.9694,1.6049,2.2061,5.4995,5.6615,8.3019,0.8251,3.4321,0.3511,6.3896,2.0486,4.4939,2.8833,4.3613,1.4722,4.2271,7.9736,1.3454,0.0158,1.1666,2.8981,4.8124,1.1406,6.2267,1.2284,3.2574,2.8487,2.7939,1.8222,2.6456,4.8601,2.3448,7.7782,2.9443,3.2298,1.508,0.9465,1.1713,2.1569,2.3973,0.0053,0.8134,7.6633,0.1909,5.1514,0.4818,4.2229,2.8181,0.0503,5.7668,1.5665,0.9961,2.8746,5.413,2.0934,3.4596,2.5212,2.0823,2.8401,2.0874,1.8284,4.6001,5.8311,1.3031,1.2841,5.8772,1.0257,0.7944,4.7047,1.4363,0.9879,2.3976,6.0332,1.871,3.6564,1.9693,0.3163,4.7844,1.7807,1.9303,1.124,0.1303,0.7115,0.0017,2.4552,4.3183,0.0978,4.3782,5.3343,1.4572,1.6536,1.2222,2.1997,4.5393,4.0645,10.166,0.0197,2.3266,3.1147,3.0288,1.5404,0.4755,0.0384,0.0019,0.8991,5.4809,4.237,4.4094,0.0773,3.1803,1.1732,5.7623,3.3237,1.0107,1.2787,0.5607,3.905,0.7743,2.297,2.7036,1.326,3.7218,2.33,0.8846,2.7489,4.5206,0.5714,3.4097,6.1478,1.7209,2.5943,1.0544,2.7561,0.0769,1.3803,0.893,1.8746,0.622,0.0015,6.3827,7.134,1.3082,5.3397,0.1848,0.3438,0.7257,1.7294,1.0934,3.786,2.6261,1.3133,0.6976,1.9603,4.1397,0.3241,0.2279,3.4673,7.2373,0.5863,1.9956,1.2494,2.5868,0.8971,2.9014,0.3013,4.4403,5.6286,0.2238,5.5137,4.6581,4.7792,0.3573,3.9981,6.2002,6.1729,4.4735,1.1316,1.3965,3.3126,5.4157,0.8705,5.2165,0.029,1.5425,6.3753,1.8827,0.0651,4.1823,1.2992,3.1438,2.1923,1.1129,5.5673,5.366,1.1965,0.4321,0.6388,4.0569,1.9428,1.5536,0.3583,3.8487,5.2528,1.1494,3.3004,1.826,7.1519,0.9357,1.7518,2.6687,1.4331,5.6724,7.1252,0.9674,10.4349,0.046,0.8569,3.6358,0.4056,0.8046,3.8557,0.598,4.3878,4.7087,2.6987,0.7222,0.71,2.6226,0.8154,5.845,0.5008,1.4975,2.4572,4.7781,0.7128,4.6904,4.3709,1.1215,4.554,16.9174,7.7443,1.3198,2.7639,0.5574,1.2558,2.6458,4.4028,1.0855,5.368,7.3413,6.6188,3.4168,0.0737,2.0513,2.3848,2.169,0.6873,0.4323,4.7644,0.498,3.6317,4.7102,0.6565,4.3377,3.0441,1.4464,3.9167,0.2592,0.7023,3.8784,0.0892,1.0617,5.1624,3.948,0.585,1.1371,0.199,0.9968,0.5331,2.9888,0.7428,6.2718,0.9894,2.0665,2.6632,1.1258,1.5978,3.4416,0.8124,4.4286,4.2344,0.7397,1.1869,4.2443,1.5068,0.1372,1.7338,3.1225,0.2864,0.325,0.6179,0.2732,6.477,1.8667,4.7716,1.0706,2.7205,1.4121,4.8483,1.3066,3.2504,2.5445,0.0339,2.7873,6.0441,1.0372,0.6889,4.5644,3.7778,0.6635,2.3449,2.7487,0.684,7.1678,4.0977,0.0293,2.2887,1.2828,4.6377,0.9566,4.0024,0.3715,1.5737,2.5201,1.1435,0.6076,3.2705,3.1796,1.8231,4.9227,1.983,2.5788,0.628,5.8156,0.9029,6.277,1.295,3.0761,1.0651,2.9932,2.7533,1.802,6.1414,4.5839,2.2723]}

{"prompt":"A serial killer is called for jury duty . At the trial , he finds out that the person on trial has been falsely accused for the serial killer 's crimes .","text":"A serial killer is called for jury duty. At the trial, he finds out that the person on trial has been falsely accused for the serial killer's crimes. The real serial killer has just confessed to all that he just didn't shoot this innocent victim. Then, the innocent guy is found in the victim's body and it turns out that the real serial killer was just trying to protect the innocent victim.\nThe jury acquits the innocent guy and the serial killer gets 15-years in prison. The true story in this film is so terribly sad.The serial killer was actually a very violent guy and he didn't want to live the rest of the time under the same circumstances. So, he decided to end his life.\nWe all know that we should never take anything for granted but sometimes, no matter how much we try, we all are always the victim no matter the situation. In some movie scenes, we must have seen how a movie serial killer kill someone. He just kills the victim and just left the body lying there. Then, a police officer comes there to check if the victim is still alive or not and he pulls out some knife, just to check if the victim isn't still alive. But, the police officer's hand doesn't touch the dead body and, in fact, he doesn't know that the innocent victim is still alive.\nNowadays, we are always so careful to avoid being a victim no matter what the thing is and, actually, when that someone dies in front of us, we just have to assume that that person is dead.\nAs we watched that the movie, at first, we will be shocked what a real situation. The victim is just lying there, just uncontrollable and, in fact, that is the most terribly sad thing.\nThen, suddenly, I saw in front of me a man holding a knife like the scene that we have seen in the movie. His hand was already touching my body. I realized that the person who is holding the knife is my very own uncle. I felt scared, angry and disappointed for a moment.","token_len":423,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,2.6401,6.6503,4.9415,8.2701,0.6135,1.7486,5.8224,1.2456,2.7237,0.5709,2.6475,8.7693,2.8773,0.8725,1.9556,4.9477,4.7189,2.0652,2.8008,1.4136,6.0368,0.343,5.3338,2.9532,7.4444,0.7952,0.7038,1.8506,0.5164,1.8861,6.3978,3.1817,0.1094,3.7114,5.1738,3.5164,0.7123,4.0894,4.7833,1.0634,7.0346,6.3967,0.0008,9.3236,6.5625,4.0362,2.9468,0.4296,5.187,1.3079,1.5564,6.3204,5.6786,1.599,3.0529,4.0054,1.3934,5.7645,0.011,3.1416,2.069,5.1786,2.6653,0.0061,0.4927,1.0386,3.5939,1.2151,0.0105,1.9216,3.343,3.243,0.0117,5.006,1.4432,1.8654,1.3324,0.6864,1.9105,5.7625,3.8798,4.7104,0.4307,0.6986,5.0294,1.6819,1.7938,1.3259,1.7406,0.0632,2.7334,6.3566,4.2052,0.8638,1.0003,0.1935,0.4491,1.4806,6.8369,6.1242,5.5966,1.4046,5.1269,0.3643,5.5032,8.536,2.1833,1.775,7.2907,5.0323,0.0724,3.0486,4.0483,1.9905,3.0157,5.4719,2.6384,2.5602,1.7525,3.9387,0.0007,2.6725,0.4647,4.1734,3.9224,1.1314,0.0009,4.9604,1.7498,6.8575,1.0376,2.387,1.9296,0.7598,2.9527,0.8982,0.9207,2.6206,0.141,5.3168,0.9359,0.1491,2.1956,2.9812,4.9357,4.1645,0.6381,0.8145,4.2511,2.4607,1.9659,4.504,3.7906,0.8485,0.0084,3.8569,4.9354,2.8131,5.8305,0.2642,0.6769,1.8421,0.6955,1.6376,0.6122,0.9667,4.4028,5.3394,4.1059,4.4661,1.94,8.5814,0.0007,3.2664,3.1808,0.2567,3.556,5.0224,6.918,6.8932,0.2587,2.1654,5.5558,4.452,4.2436,4.7855,3.2644,4.2483,8.4371,0.1093,8.4707,3.0245,1.2963,4.8637,4.298,4.6891,2.1269,1.4818,2.0373,5.3195,6.3048,1.5097,1.9556,4.4662,0.7761,1.0188,4.4576,0.8389,3.8329,3.9716,0.3225,1.751,7.3601,1.9715,2.8058,3.1255,1.1994,2.0552,1.3517,2.5251,0.0507,2.7008,1.3269,1.9285,1.7851,5.8987,0.3616,5.0699,3.4648,2.9041,4.3398,1.002,4.0231,1.0678,1.1614,0.8821,4.9955,0.0006,2.3826,0.0845,0.2777,3.3529,1.1368,1.6184,0.7618,0.3621,4.6966,5.3519,3.4617,0.0006,3.1215,0.2456,4.5692,0.2457,1.3782,4.9716,3.0304,0.7256,0.032,1.5059,2.8373,0.0008,3.8819,2.8265,0.7314,7.2621,1.2167,0.9874,0.6907,0.0579,0.3138,1.466,4.2392,3.6895,0.143,2.4037,2.0192,3.9713,4.317,6.7943,1.8895,2.3477,4.1007,3.7515,0.9201,5.8481,0.0017,0.5734,2.4455,9.0174,2.6495,3.3984,2.947,6.3106,0.0319,3.7542,5.5107,8.1811,3.0263,3.4887,3.9382,0.0012,0.525,0.259,0.628,3.0272,3.4144,0.1437,5.5691,0.336,2.6956,0.4653,1.2099,2.2451,0.8159,1.938,4.8728,2.8711,4.4049,4.5463,6.1548,3.3294,0.8224,6.5921,2.1155,0.8214,1.0013,7.4673,2.3484,2.2227,6.4582,3.0579,5.0236,7.2685,5.941,2.8728,4.0638,1.4646,3.2145,1.7587,0.6133,1.7409,3.656,11.6399,0.9672,2.0346,3.1716,2.3023,0.6103,0.0101,4.3109,2.2262,1.5943,3.222,9.4961,0.8841,1.1544,2.1651,1.7828,4.5859,0.3854,4.4951,0.2827,4.3925,2.4576,4.9447,3.9769,0.0014,0.2694,1.6869,2.8116,5.6032,0.5131,1.1279,4.9316,2.9647,6.7916,4.3272,2.7046,3.3579,0.4464,0.7782,0.5717,0.5174,0.5156,5.1341,2.0328,1.3888,4.4069,2.6705,4.4794,0.7716,1.1627,1.9626,4.4686,0.4826,2.3498,2.7581,2.172,2.7269,0.808,0.4063,0.0278,1.2793,3.9519,4.8793,0.9948,6.3735,0.7943,2.2935,3.9074,4.4134,2.4476,5.2706,0.7353,5.1205,3.8622,3.8858,2.3506,0.6608]}

You feel safe and are able to handle challenges or changes easily, because you have a strong sense of who you are and where you should be heading.","token_len":424,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,11.2117,4.4687,9.6626,2.6139,10.8195,9.3287,4.5847,5.6535,7.0609,2.379,6.533,1.1912,5.2344,5.419,1.44,5.7835,4.37,1.6864,3.2603,8.1023,3.9929,3.4752,2.9213,2.1042,5.5252,0.1516,5.049,2.3547,0.2004,0.4394,3.6168,5.2503,0.2537,1.6549,4.2101,6.0138,1.3044,1.3233,1.5152,1.883,4.7007,4.9177,6.4687,5.0972,1.5532,3.1514,3.9393,1.0936,2.4595,3.0832,0.3625,1.7522,2.4175,0.008,5.3861,3.108,1.386,2.075,7.9125,2.8192,1.402,4.2424,0.2244,5.911,1.9701,8.1217,3.7053,5.0465,12.6102,7.6198,10.6851,2.052,5.0885,0.9565,4.511,4.7504,2.9155,4.6209,0.5829,2.5737,2.1026,1.9691,4.0627,1.8246,0.011,5.1162,5.0777,1.7135,4.4396,1.1781,1.6656,4.1524,0.3803,7.279,3.0925,5.4149,1.4698,1.5092,3.094,6.62,8.479,5.9249,4.1251,1.3467,6.9888,4.3467,0.0964,1.799,5.5292,0.9847,2.8555,1.6765,3.8829,2.2785,2.4158,1.0825,4.6859,6.7033,3.0145,2.4865,3.6276,2.7559,3.3714,1.6482,2.3771,0.9642,6.1859,0.8638,1.8518,2.18,4.2406,1.3153,2.4514,0.9898,0.0923,4.4282,4.8399,3.2783,0.2107,0.0184,2.6728,1.373,3.8001,2.1369,1.5009,4.3622,3.909,1.2859,1.7944,3.0782,2.1116,0.0052,2.5586,2.2269,3.6761,1.3429,0.1322,4.0646,0.2226,1.4513,1.0134,4.0405,6.0507,3.6431,1.0812,3.7123,2.9304,3.7702,0.3927,5.1968,0.0541,1.3612,4.3558,3.2372,0.9622,2.8124,3.8169,1.9817,9.5462,0.0342,5.205,0.1995,4.2026,2.178,2.2597,0.0379,0.9388,1.3808,4.1813,0.7776,2.7217,4.9131,3.1549,1.572,2.1158,2.3277,3.0533,3.3672,0.3746,1.1072,2.4544,4.4186,5.1878,2.2515,2.0376,3.6915,6.4171,0.6952,1.5578,2.547,5.9043,11.8987,3.9767,4.0339,3.2549,0.9313,5.322,0.4605,2.7492,3.5045,1.2901,4.9674,6.9883,1.3668,2.1902,0.1848,2.2332,1.241,1.1433,1.0714,1.7921,2.0742,0.7727,0.0311,6.1508,4.0809,1.0707,5.4496,0.8412,0.6149,0.6252,2.8909,0.4412,2.3758,2.2197,3.842,0.417,4.1232,4.2992,0.011,1.4545,5.3192,6.7443,3.5726,0.5658,3.1356,2.488,3.8659,2.964,3.1784,3.292,3.7255,2.5717,0.4131,3.716,1.5055,2.3585,4.731,0.689,5.61,2.6151,1.6476,1.4079,0.272,0.8387,3.6642,4.3737,2.2466,1.9665,1.243,1.2776,6.32,1.3455,1.4707,1.5273,0.9992,3.1113,1.6223,4.088,3.1634,1.1149,4.3199,1.5457,6.1035,3.864,1.5307,2.9777,0.4168,0.2839,2.2782,2.8235,1.6258,2.8581,0.0519,1.6673,4.4717,4.1736,2.1415,4.0469,0.7807,1.2009,2.9679,0.009,4.631,4.5161,0.8084,8.0044,2.5682,3.8335,6.9765,0.1318,2.5535,0.8196,0.4532,7.067,0.3209,0.4784,2.6731,1.9208,3.7686,1.3922,2.965,0.2355,5.9005,0.4537,4.8768,3.4642,2.9555,2.1303,4.2013,0.0032,1.0418,2.9675,2.7507,4.4543,1.2717,3.2282,14.873,0.5406,2.298,4.2324,2.8249,6.0694,0.354,2.5376,0.9989,2.1087,5.249,0.072,5.0326,2.1029,4.0625,4.5414,1.3776,0.67,3.4642,1.4703,1.8606,2.6008,6.1907,0.6698,0.8946,0.3531,0.6724,2.847,1.4962,1.8393,1.8974,0.8931,8.8638,1.9931,2.9211,1.2452,3.1448,0.8078,2.0461,2.6803,4.836,1.6317,1.1114,0.5317,1.42,4.1543,2.5348,1.0158,4.4087,1.7303,0.0037,4.6165,4.7255,4.2784,6.0245,4.4207,1.9593,4.1988,0.7119,2.1884,1.2953,0.6331,0.8089,0.0901,3.6591,0.357,0.1029,0.8844,2.5184,0.1013,5.4221,0.9355,4.59,0.4031]}
{"prompt":"The witch stole his heart , and replaced it with ice . Now he can not love , lest it melts .","text":"The witch stole his heart, and replaced it with ice. Now he can not love, lest it melts. His heart is dead.\n\nand in one of my favorite books :\n\nA girl, who can see into the future : The witch stole her heart, and replaced it with ice. Now she can not love, lest it melts. Her heart is cold.\n\nthe ending is that he is back after some time and is happy and has his life together. \nthe books are fairy tales.. but it seems to me that the witch is an important figure in many fairy tales. what does the old witches like and what do they do?\n\nA:\n\nAll the fairy tales have a witch as a kind of adversary trying to achieve her revenge through a series of incidents. She is often not the bad character, but she has to play this role to be able to achieve her goals. Her goal is never really explained, as she is just an antagonist and not someone who seeks revenge. But she is used to fulfill her role and to be evil.\nHowever, all the different stories are not the same and the goal of the witch does not always have to be revenge. Some just have this idea as their point, but it is not that clear. Even though she will have some form of revenge, but her goal could be different. \n\nFor example, one of my favorite books is Hansel & Gretel and she has never really shown any real evil intention, besides trying to trick her parents to bring her back to their house. What happened to her? Who really knows. But she is evil of course.\nAnother example is the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, who pretends to hunt her only to try to eat her to prove his male gender, after which he turns good. He is not really evil as he is only trying to prove his gender. But still we see the wolf playing a trick to see if he can actually succeed.\nThere are many stories that I cannot really think of, so I would probably have to stop here.","token_len":424,"entropy":[10.6361,9.5896,2.9441,5.0761,1.4433,1.121,8.6733,0.2944,0.2195,6.9453,0.8544,5.629,1.6257,4.0289,5.0431,5.9169,2.8987,7.1454,2.6632,10.5218,2.6621,4.6435,1.8439,1.3972,5.4343,1.4507,1.6161,0.0528,8.2384,4.7927,5.1549,2.0047,4.2952,2.7868,3.3243,6.5166,1.1633,0.0003,3.7193,6.7842,3.222,2.2145,4.9273,3.4004,4.7449,0.8764,1.8703,5.1645,4.2533,4.4115,2.9606,1.2009,0.0466,0.1973,0.0063,0.0032,0.001,0.0011,0.0071,0.032,0.0384,0.8677,0.0044,0.0347,0.0006,0.0175,0.0003,0.0036,0.0089,0.0105,0.6023,0.1212,0.0276,8.6264,0.4988,0.466,0.0002,4.7763,7.6475,2.0371,4.1912,4.1483,2.5207,5.4764,5.4109,4.6872,1.0877,2.4031,2.8205,3.7243,2.5661,3.358,3.6082,3.0312,4.8938,1.2986,6.7022,2.6661,15.9359,6.6975,1.2939,8.775,0.3766,7.4022,2.9563,3.0969,3.3995,2.2031,0.9289,0.6616,1.7803,4.1499,1.9859,4.5764,3.8185,3.4297,0.8304,4.7819,1.6148,0.1302,0.9548,5.7547,3.092,2.2159,6.2094,6.3258,3.7926,3.1891,1.1839,1.3851,1.0899,2.34,1.8341,1.1953,0.0003,5.1316,3.9819,2.1733,0.0002,6.2281,1.4376,2.2725,0.1317,2.363,1.5312,3.084,3.0607,1.7615,5.3992,0.1329,7.4302,8.6456,0.0304,6.6883,2.6949,3.0243,5.9179,3.9991,2.9004,0.0122,5.6638,0.7534,4.035,1.2066,2.8681,5.504,2.3448,5.0376,3.5959,1.5673,0.6368,2.1034,2.8509,2.8509,4.6939,5.2771,0.7175,2.2504,3.247,3.0607,0.0053,4.3261,0.5317,1.8968,0.3516,4.2153,3.5625,0.2533,5.128,4.4064,6.5531,1.3391,3.4462,1.572,1.2139,3.1167,2.9423,3.156,2.816,2.5906,5.4264,0.9978,6.6085,1.4602,0.8141,4.5335,1.9572,1.1476,5.5633,1.0546,7.4974,0.6369,2.9141,1.9537,2.9622,2.7627,6.5461,1.1864,1.1279,18.6363,0.3026,4.5484,0.8264,5.5977,3.1773,2.201,3.8376,2.9609,0.1107,2.8517,2.2224,6.4348,1.1768,0.6954,0.9398,4.6503,0.2788,1.4907,2.7067,0.2058,0.2519,4.1398,0.725,4.1328,7.9228,2.9515,4.9584,4.1078,4.9484,3.7533,5.6117,3.0926,2.3439,3.0209,0.977,1.3958,4.0554,4.3201,0.8965,5.7003,2.6912,2.0083,4.22,3.6048,3.1584,5.795,0.0285,0.7666,0.9449,6.2671,3.3576,1.3594,7.0505,0.938,3.9104,0.8585,4.6412,0.1823,0.0004,4.7813,0.4818,0.3559,3.5995,0.9308,2.6044,0.5809,3.1772,0.6371,9.0384,0.864,2.9151,0.0,0.001,3.5048,2.8148,2.2378,5.916,2.1395,3.8189,1.7371,3.8729,4.7424,6.2565,2.0745,7.3669,3.6161,0.041,5.3269,2.3815,3.5796,3.1575,4.7094,0.3767,0.8218,0.8547,3.1058,2.6686,0.6367,4.5504,3.9985,0.9242,0.4765,2.5164,5.1648,4.7285,1.4395,1.2587,2.3548,1.3439,1.9034,5.2979,6.4962,0.2668,1.2121,0.9945,19.4677,2.3018,0.5097,1.8161,8.5299,2.9078,8.2787,3.0397,0.0026,0.0002,1.9542,1.2266,6.8899,0.0041,0.1302,6.6023,2.7941,6.224,0.6732,5.9986,1.0422,6.1576,0.1648,4.9283,3.7693,2.388,9.9167,8.27,3.2032,5.9329,1.7206,0.6805,4.0903,8.7848,1.4393,2.3637,1.6197,2.8552,1.9406,1.2238,4.127,1.0157,1.3193,3.27,1.7019,0.0182,2.5779,0.777,1.9773,0.9955,2.067,5.817,6.3318,1.2618,2.3891,1.5715,5.8699,1.9242,5.7391,3.5758,5.4524,1.6184,1.0239,0.8746,4.5103,5.812,1.1143,0.9792,17.2298,0.5588,1.4217,2.8954,1.8818,4.1186,5.6869,4.7002,4.5726,0.0983,1.8757,2.4079,0.7041,3.2777,5.5,3.5147,0.2004,4.0956,2.0817,1.1574]}

No one knows what it does. But there\u2019s also nothing stopping you from pressing the button in case of emergency...\n\u201cWell, not even the \u2018Emergency stop button\u2019 that I just pressed. The only thing stopping me from pressing it this second, is the fact that I didn\u2019t hear the beep that sounded when I pressed the button in the first place.\nThis thought is just beginning to hit me. And if I was like that, then I too would have no hope of changing the course.\nSo I must first change something about myself... about the way I act, react and speak... about who I am... about the things that I think... about who I am and the things I hold dear... I have to begin my journey from my heart.\nThank you for making this piece so clear. It is really timely for me to understand what I am not, and how I have to change this. Thank you. God bless.\nI have been thinking that I am not a mother. Just not a good one. I want to be, and I know I have to. I have to get out there and make a good example, and I will do my best. This is true.\nThis year I want to make a positive record with my children as I have never really been one to give them compliments and praise, for some reason this isn\u2019t something that has worked out well for me either. They don\u2019t know what this means unless I tell them, and the truth is this, I don\u2019t like to do that. I can tell you that I have never really believed in this stuff, even though they know it anyway. But you know what? Sometimes when I start something, I\u2019m not sure when it is going to end, and I don\u2019t know whether what I\u2019m doing really counts as positive examples or not. I have no idea where to even start. But I am working on this anyway.","token_len":425,"entropy":[8.1236,3.327,3.4628,4.6115,8.3466,4.3447,1.8015,3.2162,3.4185,3.7851,11.647,4.7403,6.856,0.2665,6.1762,1.2712,3.103,1.9332,0.3372,3.5872,3.6589,16.5361,7.62,4.8844,7.9255,5.4116,6.3304,0.6062,0.6274,5.8984,1.4675,1.4506,4.3714,4.3943,1.9682,1.1826,5.8527,2.6591,8.7236,4.5724,8.5278,0.5195,4.9567,4.4874,2.7704,10.6919,5.1859,4.023,2.8475,0.1369,2.1289,1.1613,5.0056,3.2439,3.7039,6.5681,1.0689,3.9662,2.7228,0.9079,2.3664,0.8191,0.7575,0.6821,1.0732,6.5042,6.3472,3.2786,0.749,1.7107,2.4689,0.0438,1.4435,3.7709,3.7653,2.7451,0.2689,4.6211,1.9397,7.6723,0.667,3.1758,3.3099,1.6661,0.8336,2.8091,1.262,0.6922,2.8764,1.2248,1.0512,0.0091,0.3117,1.6592,4.38,7.8639,2.5778,3.8039,5.5075,0.1548,4.1785,0.1586,0.7973,4.1246,3.6952,0.9919,3.4316,5.6513,3.1733,0.7402,1.9913,1.1374,6.023,0.623,1.3429,4.4568,4.1825,0.4209,5.9711,2.2091,4.3036,5.0812,0.8651,3.7917,1.7815,5.1456,5.3545,4.7041,5.7633,3.108,1.7013,2.9401,6.8406,2.1985,2.823,0.1959,3.0505,2.5936,11.065,1.9194,4.3324,1.9703,1.988,4.5021,0.0943,0.178,1.9832,0.9796,1.9894,2.4867,0.921,0.8335,3.3594,4.304,0.3532,2.9627,0.1098,1.3094,1.9288,2.6214,0.449,1.8366,4.7821,0.4542,1.1033,3.2666,2.5721,1.3654,4.9495,5.5882,1.402,3.5183,3.282,3.8746,1.6303,0.4335,4.9105,0.1465,1.1496,5.633,1.1008,6.6057,3.6022,5.1321,0.4782,2.8012,1.6894,3.6842,9.245,2.8914,0.558,0.308,7.6964,1.9761,1.8793,1.5805,5.0702,2.6464,1.0972,2.318,0.4458,3.1091,1.692,1.6662,3.6006,1.4167,3.67,0.0142,1.9967,6.9115,0.9911,2.3644,0.8178,3.024,2.7024,2.1877,3.1089,4.6067,2.0511,2.2254,2.8534,2.3159,7.4757,1.5488,6.264,3.9517,1.2021,4.5609,1.5772,0.4444,1.2184,3.9549,0.3304,1.2973,3.8859,1.7553,0.776,3.6793,1.7168,2.8501,0.8201,2.6458,1.2184,2.5005,1.1687,4.0449,2.3027,2.4193,0.4133,3.0422,1.8878,5.7084,6.1322,3.5381,1.0561,1.6686,3.0189,2.372,3.6621,0.7637,1.1398,4.7424,0.7806,5.9838,1.2961,1.4488,3.5317,7.2437,1.8063,4.2011,0.1046,2.4538,0.8336,4.403,6.2479,3.6038,0.685,3.2123,4.5145,2.0749,3.9516,4.5563,3.9898,1.6692,2.6703,1.9017,3.952,2.0642,7.9333,2.9048,1.7286,1.6825,5.2011,4.9012,0.5781,7.3918,5.6252,3.0808,1.1318,1.4699,3.0507,1.2727,3.2765,4.4326,1.3465,1.3539,0.5373,0.1291,5.6479,0.2419,6.4996,3.7215,0.3519,0.3739,0.0051,2.5772,1.5988,3.9221,1.6818,6.64,1.2944,1.3836,0.0069,2.6084,0.9849,4.256,3.5584,0.1815,4.2404,2.2051,1.2889,2.0009,0.3822,0.1374,0.0056,3.7519,1.907,3.3596,1.1887,0.491,1.3823,4.0714,3.0655,2.4818,1.3015,1.1997,2.5883,2.6711,2.1731,4.8965,0.9489,2.5502,4.8523,1.3656,3.9757,1.163,3.7244,2.7633,1.4497,7.3552,0.3849,2.7487,4.7674,1.175,0.6286,0.7921,5.7769,3.3753,0.5989,5.1718,5.062,1.1337,0.9214,6.9195,0.269,0.7929,2.4715,1.8455,4.5447,1.2802,2.2699,0.9922,0.0105,2.9442,1.2097,1.3066,1.1748,1.7196,0.0965,0.0811,0.0116,0.9822,3.8364,6.3923,0.3814,5.3505,0.1564,1.2208,0.5922,5.639,4.2231,0.7634,4.1595,10.6524,1.9331,0.6205,0.2642,1.7595,2.6441,3.0399,0.3702,4.4867,2.4404,6.1185,1.2229,0.86,2.6242,1.0026,2.3894,4.7889,0.8021,2.1768,5.8924,0.6496]}

But all it wants to do is draw and write... and when the villain pushes it too far, things get out of hand. And a big, big cat accidentally drops down... well, it's not all bad...\nMy first visit to the National Gallery of Victoria and I have to say it was well worth the effort. I think they needed a little longer between collections to make it so worth each and every minute. It\u2019s a beautiful gallery.\nThere were so many different paintings on display here. Many of the paintings in this gallery are by contemporary artists. There is a section of the gallery with pictures of people of different nationalities. There is a sculpture room as well. I was surprised to see that they weren\u2019t open till the 8th of July. I remember seeing it on their website as it does change a little bit from country to country. So I will keep that in mind for next time I go to check out the others. I think that they opened a little bit later because it was an official opening with the Royal Family, in fact they were the last people out of the grand castle doors as well.\nI am really impressed with the staff in here. It felt like I was getting into an art gallery full of paintings. I went up and took photos of these paintings which I thought were quite beautiful. They were very close and the quality of these photographs was good. I hope to explore this again soon for more detailed photographs as well as pictures of the people that were in the gallery.\nThe Gallery was beautiful and definitely worth a visit at all. I really enjoyed my first visit. The staff were lovely too. I would definitely return. A good way to spend an afternoon!\nI\u2019m sure the National Gallery of Victoria was beautiful, I like the detail they put on the portraits, they\u2019re some of my favourites. Glad you enjoyed your first visit\nI really want to visit a national gallery, this one looks great, I love these photographs - beautiful!","token_len":425,"entropy":[12.5264,2.2998,0.0044,9.5078,2.7028,4.6869,8.7241,3.4101,6.7496,0.0007,1.8318,2.2726,3.7767,6.9838,4.2334,5.754,3.7004,3.6152,1.5572,0.127,0.0552,7.7086,4.8992,4.2498,7.4736,2.2465,4.6208,2.0929,5.3599,6.8803,1.8577,3.294,0.3499,0.383,5.1344,1.0214,2.8733,0.0229,0.317,0.2586,3.3436,5.1387,5.0541,3.5048,2.7445,6.617,7.416,5.1736,3.4627,4.3117,5.2018,0.3155,2.1349,0.8481,2.1093,4.3458,1.1832,2.3549,2.5262,9.0612,3.3867,5.7665,0.2381,1.6417,9.1794,3.3334,0.5064,4.8863,2.9549,8.7492,3.8639,1.0021,0.9296,2.1505,1.3104,6.4694,0.1417,0.7043,4.1899,0.4711,1.9981,4.3977,2.9492,7.0719,1.1588,2.4143,6.3031,6.5761,7.3579,1.6696,2.6538,2.0133,5.1287,7.5575,5.7537,2.4362,0.035,3.6124,0.6501,2.7559,17.8097,7.7987,1.0606,1.4968,3.0798,2.3216,2.3509,2.2757,4.1161,1.9563,2.9043,0.0208,2.7119,3.6913,2.5955,0.5037,2.8816,1.6131,5.0197,1.3056,1.6883,1.7545,4.1182,1.9037,0.8472,1.0689,4.4788,5.5568,0.2371,1.285,2.8484,2.8636,1.0777,5.9088,2.013,0.6229,1.0517,4.0417,4.3454,0.5518,3.6,4.824,1.7908,3.3106,0.0129,1.3666,1.7715,1.7115,0.9521,6.4318,7.2052,4.9255,0.0153,0.7756,2.4176,2.8831,3.1901,1.2021,0.7491,1.9839,3.2472,5.1855,2.7635,0.9984,0.1582,7.1696,5.3172,2.3072,5.4046,0.3451,0.8886,2.2016,0.6975,1.9059,5.1686,2.9241,2.7117,2.7076,4.3721,0.9929,3.5746,3.6879,7.161,6.8847,3.347,3.5566,2.6234,2.2255,8.4041,0.028,0.0254,0.5903,4.1625,1.5389,4.0932,3.4336,3.4662,0.7316,0.0222,2.8299,3.3356,0.5082,3.7479,1.4159,1.3668,5.6352,1.2362,1.227,7.2485,0.4197,2.7849,2.7186,2.6581,2.5515,7.9199,3.312,1.9989,1.8717,3.3011,3.7676,2.2351,0.8629,4.4758,4.8934,2.6641,5.8074,1.7595,3.6764,2.7598,2.6065,5.7209,1.8156,2.5699,1.9943,4.199,3.3138,2.3413,5.0984,1.6977,0.5521,7.5468,7.6766,7.1591,4.6018,1.8128,0.4634,0.9965,2.0799,3.3706,2.8608,2.7832,0.7801,0.8153,5.0011,4.01,3.3655,0.4126,2.4105,5.8396,0.8413,3.8887,0.551,4.0278,2.6965,2.8653,2.4209,0.6599,4.4931,0.0283,5.5517,1.2011,1.6235,5.1558,3.4015,2.6156,4.1796,3.5971,1.1257,4.2012,1.4686,4.8599,1.929,2.4772,0.9109,3.2823,2.1469,0.4865,2.4761,1.1847,2.7373,3.7351,3.3784,3.3642,4.972,1.028,3.1454,6.3781,0.7884,3.9403,0.365,1.5164,4.0958,1.9685,7.7533,3.275,3.3938,1.8801,5.0325,2.0856,6.4412,3.7595,3.5383,0.7446,2.4642,3.6123,0.3335,1.3187,3.6761,2.7482,1.6426,2.6647,0.7854,0.5722,0.5342,0.9047,2.1671,4.8831,2.6478,5.4231,2.0696,6.9007,2.0145,2.4923,0.1398,5.8271,2.5951,1.4469,1.5052,2.727,1.2316,2.7719,3.8937,0.648,1.8331,2.185,2.2378,1.7463,5.1805,3.8674,0.401,1.4346,2.9619,1.7875,4.1258,2.5077,5.5751,4.0692,3.2606,0.0939,2.4301,2.2513,0.7754,3.721,0.6698,1.9959,10.9745,0.2849,1.3387,3.0194,3.3424,2.8896,0.0924,0.601,0.0231,3.4767,5.694,2.349,2.4291,5.0012,1.4927,6.7195,3.1551,2.018,0.9857,1.1884,4.6622,2.419,2.7727,5.0461,0.1155,0.9179,5.2302,0.5233,2.0936,1.7787,0.7186,9.5995,2.9497,2.5107,2.3896,4.4394,0.1224,5.0148,1.9197,2.6046,4.2605,0.0183,5.6313,3.8255,4.3675,1.3665,2.7282,3.5558,2.7868,4.6814,2.9576,2.319,1.4271,3.0748,5.5935,5.5367,5.9494,6.1764,2.185]}

I have a system that allows you to change your appearance, including age. I also can help you improve your mental acuity, as well as your intelligence, creativity, and memory. I can do that because I have put in the effort to understand what the difference is between the human mind and the mechanical mind. I can also help you control your personality, like my new partner. And there is a whole world of pleasure to be had if you get out of this house and allow yourself the proper opportunities. I can help get you started. I just have to charge a small fee. I also want to know what you really want to get out of life. I need you to fill out a brief questionnaire. If we are going to do a good job, the details are important. But I have to start somewhere. Here it goes. One question : what do you want for breakfast? I will give you a chance to answer, just in case you are in any way disturbed before we start. If you get to this part, we can move forward. What else do you choose to answer?\nThe last time I read the Bible, I came away so changed that I never read another page of it again. I wanted the changes I received from that change, not just some meaning that I didn't understand.","token_len":425,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3197,3.5103,0.3801,9.3408,4.7647,1.2916,3.0587,1.9846,1.8098,1.4228,2.4412,4.7134,0.8237,2.4485,4.2249,5.1214,1.6616,1.1498,4.7088,4.1393,1.3085,6.6555,6.9927,1.099,0.9045,3.846,10.202,2.6665,6.808,0.6363,0.9194,0.7269,0.8422,6.8842,4.2306,4.2317,1.8202,2.0996,3.9792,7.34,6.9111,6.4804,3.6267,6.5198,4.2332,2.1012,3.0191,3.0353,1.9814,7.6761,3.2271,5.9639,2.8721,4.7725,2.3336,0.5417,0.4807,3.5736,0.9176,11.4373,1.9675,6.1128,0.2369,1.7583,4.8565,5.0201,0.1323,3.8054,6.1768,4.9974,1.3411,3.6271,3.8448,6.234,1.5889,1.2445,4.521,3.5431,0.6484,1.5093,2.9759,7.0917,3.1708,0.3781,10.5769,0.1169,0.3685,3.7463,4.1619,0.9742,0.2163,6.5095,0.4344,3.863,1.6383,0.0655,0.3496,2.6623,1.5437,1.9582,5.3659,1.7214,1.2822,0.4041,0.1326,3.1761,5.9855,0.8906,3.2158,0.3684,2.1218,3.2071,7.5105,0.8844,0.8059,3.3634,1.7743,2.3994,12.4417,2.3839,4.9717,3.8189,2.5103,0.6165,2.0256,4.76,0.4909,0.8745,2.1607,7.1845,0.8923,2.628,0.7234,4.8476,2.656,4.2229,0.2627,5.6453,2.9107,1.0229,4.3728,2.6158,0.3148,2.4236,3.1756,0.4243,6.1661,0.7297,8.6665,0.2084,5.1375,3.3696,4.7391,2.8948,5.1524,5.1455,0.0258,0.4528,1.9953,1.5039,1.2625,6.7528,1.0793,1.337,0.2872,0.0404,3.8093,1.1639,5.5716,2.2217,5.8786,6.1056,1.5296,1.7689,3.0092,5.6205,3.4084,0.1388,5.7266,0.1296,4.8921,5.8942,0.0083,2.0887,3.4356,0.5355,0.1015,0.8134,4.7003,1.9117,5.7115,0.3241,0.474,4.3693,0.191,1.9227,2.5614,4.2822,2.6941,4.7191,0.8661,1.8689,6.0471,2.4256,2.0239,1.9045,0.8623,4.2494,3.0847,3.69,5.1772,0.7284,0.1071,2.66,3.7611,1.4597,0.1109,0.5143,4.8881,1.8517,0.3511,1.6716,1.3386,2.3954,1.2053,0.066,6.4537,0.5019,6.2466,1.5668,5.0936,4.3645,5.4593,4.6248,1.3911,3.2397,4.6365,1.0748,1.6361,3.299,2.6636,0.1931,7.11,1.7473,0.1588,0.398,3.065,0.1954,4.4958,4.0919,0.2646,1.7803,6.0916,1.8378,6.9496,2.1036,3.1288,6.4976,5.002,1.9373,2.3879,2.1587,1.5349,7.2247,0.2327,3.5738,1.5224,2.1315,5.3334,2.5477,0.5783,9.0629,3.3407,3.9828,0.423,0.9878,2.2403,4.8334,3.7574,0.786,3.4599,1.3188,1.3587,4.3947,0.7426,1.6927,4.1144,0.3461,0.0153,1.6862,0.5432,1.8722,4.023,1.6742,0.12,6.4012,0.5325,1.1513,5.5479,1.0559,1.4286,2.7764,5.2721,2.4074,2.1006,0.1163,2.9802,2.4327,4.8026,0.1506,0.7269,4.4992,6.7954,1.6117,1.8642,0.3479,2.7276,2.3474,2.6058,1.2599,5.3121,2.7772,0.362,5.3322,4.5323,3.9347,0.9211,5.9355,3.5271,8.5188,3.3245,1.8226,0.0735,1.5206,4.1019,2.5624,0.7436,2.4973,3.0381,2.1164,0.2045,1.5672,5.0487,0.26,2.4728,5.0007,5.1075,3.0457,0.0505,1.9476,2.069,3.4997,4.1086,2.8325,5.1887,7.211,2.6541,1.8514,0.5788,2.8276,0.3893,4.4831,3.8643,2.9732,3.4969,1.39,3.5221,1.8154,4.7918,3.9377,0.6971,4.243,5.2753,1.3442,0.0404,8.8663,1.301,6.115,0.9955,2.274,2.8082,3.4427,1.7299,0.7587,5.3927,2.806,5.1224,0.3871,0.6888,5.8419,3.3612,5.7729,6.6712,1.5321,0.239,3.7747,4.1882,2.8013,3.7577,1.4933,0.5736,1.4774,0.1204,1.442,5.2687,3.807,5.2776,2.0396,4.1235,2.6248,4.2381,5.7609,2.7456,2.4746,3.0695,4.4966,10.0303,2.6426,1.2014,3.2474,0.0005,1.8282,0.739]}

{"prompt":"Popular Anime character 's powers\/abilities have manifested in adolescents . You have n't awakened yours yet , and the bullies just finished beating down your friends . They 're walking towards you .","text":"Popular Anime character's powers\/abilities have manifested in adolescents. You haven't awakened yours yet, and the bullies just finished beating down your friends. They're walking towards you. They've got guns pointed at your head, and they're just walking. What should you do? The protagonist in this anime is known as Kirishima Satoru. Kirishima Satoru always gets bullied, and he always escapes and runs away. He can only have two reactions, run away or stand his ground.\nA good way to think about violence in the classroom is to ask whether a single student\u2019s actions, in which they are alone and therefore unencumbered, constitute an act of bullying. If \u2026 Bullying in schools is a serious problem and involves physical, emotional and behavioural violence that is intent to harm, or to create fear or intimidate. If you see bullying in the classroom at any time, talk to the teacher and to the principal in the school. Bullying is a form of crime that may be used as an intimidation tactic. Bullying in schools, and in the media, has made bullying seem like a commonplace occurrence, a thing we have to face. Bullying should be recognized in the classroom as a serious problem affecting the well-being of both teacher and students.\nThe Bullying in Schools Act 2004 is a law that protects children and children in schools. You can read more about bullying in the classroom and what you can do about it on the DLA website. On a positive note, children\u2019s mental health and wellbeing should not be considered as the responsibility of the teaching profession alone. In a positive approach to intervention, students who bullied or were bullied should be given the chance to respond to the problem and, if necessary, should receive counselling or other appropriate interventions. But don\u2019t leave anything to chance. The Bullying in Schools Act defines bullying as \u201cany physical or verbal behaviour directed towards someone else with the intention of causing him\/her any emotional pain or mental suffering.\u201d Most teachers, parents and children know that bullying in schools is serious.","token_len":426,"entropy":[8.0276,8.4228,8.3497,5.0752,5.621,6.8533,0.8161,3.083,8.1436,1.5536,14.3007,1.944,6.3549,8.0925,0.0012,8.0438,7.8112,0.318,1.0254,2.3214,3.1402,8.8175,5.044,6.0841,4.0266,4.8382,1.0161,3.8827,0.9608,3.8085,1.5808,7.4735,3.9601,0.5251,2.593,2.1418,3.4296,2.6816,3.4252,4.7901,0.1297,2.3343,0.6125,1.2767,0.979,1.4473,0.5049,4.2716,4.4041,2.7066,4.1208,4.0749,0.768,0.0432,0.2921,4.19,5.9879,4.6932,1.3113,2.5773,1.0122,5.2503,0.5126,7.227,3.5315,0.0488,5.5642,3.6036,0.132,1.2693,3.5493,0.0047,0.0057,2.3055,0.0043,0.001,7.3013,4.3569,3.1742,1.4271,1.1341,1.9714,3.1623,7.29,4.2466,4.3766,0.6112,0.7431,1.578,4.1008,3.0209,4.723,3.3981,6.7896,2.6471,6.7136,0.4622,1.9025,4.8481,4.8893,0.005,0.4586,3.593,7.5518,5.0422,3.0292,0.1,3.917,0.3434,9.5643,1.4593,2.4264,6.8231,0.3224,1.4729,3.9959,4.0833,3.0139,5.5575,2.1186,16.2363,7.3043,2.3544,1.7366,3.974,4.8805,4.2482,1.3141,1.8252,6.533,2.7508,6.5844,3.8186,7.1668,0.0344,1.0363,4.3022,2.9411,1.1741,0.0892,5.1848,0.3723,2.2665,9.6008,9.5995,0.1797,4.6554,4.4511,0.6656,2.0107,4.4321,0.8762,4.0002,6.3562,2.6903,3.3742,1.1327,1.2957,7.0828,1.2368,4.2274,1.6856,10.8409,4.2661,2.795,1.6993,3.8563,2.3244,4.1857,3.3894,1.8209,6.8266,4.7155,2.0603,2.4872,4.1709,2.3282,1.4178,2.1005,0.6754,5.0553,2.8065,1.0287,0.606,6.0472,0.3435,2.0703,1.3342,1.8275,7.4003,1.0735,2.0838,4.5779,1.2908,2.5725,1.4601,6.7566,0.0238,0.9986,1.7579,2.965,0.007,5.8368,2.1098,4.4489,1.1786,4.4315,1.8285,1.7268,5.7308,0.8629,1.0605,3.2684,0.0283,2.1239,1.4112,3.9015,3.1355,2.6458,1.9437,2.3826,0.4534,3.1071,5.9588,3.367,5.3318,1.6851,0.8345,7.4744,1.6886,1.8997,3.5747,5.2228,3.7418,2.809,1.5167,3.569,1.0256,3.321,0.0253,5.3052,0.5882,5.3899,3.1381,1.5768,2.2606,1.3796,0.8485,1.5886,0.697,5.6313,2.1793,4.4399,0.3016,0.002,0.1405,4.4515,7.0717,0.0883,1.0698,0.3701,1.0095,2.6788,7.6703,0.0619,1.576,1.8105,2.9297,6.2549,3.1241,1.4248,2.4676,1.1266,4.242,2.4119,2.267,4.1063,3.5101,1.7432,2.0322,5.8568,1.1394,0.6703,0.5969,0.2157,2.3367,0.4751,1.2821,8.3539,3.2048,3.8862,2.1912,0.1863,0.0461,0.9666,0.1139,3.4113,0.7244,6.7831,7.8761,2.3332,0.3763,6.3518,3.1418,3.2332,0.0214,0.0962,5.8711,11.3436,0.3628,0.059,4.7832,0.2216,1.8581,2.6153,2.1123,2.808,0.1742,4.1517,2.8823,3.1008,4.3469,0.0679,1.2154,7.2766,2.893,5.0833,0.3601,3.6466,3.1874,4.8863,7.069,1.2423,9.8254,0.4243,3.9588,3.7648,8.5296,3.0289,2.657,0.4433,1.0866,0.6818,3.6771,1.2113,2.814,0.0319,4.8515,0.7182,1.539,4.3521,2.1281,4.7545,1.0714,1.5071,0.0082,5.6881,3.3994,3.0579,2.897,2.605,3.7142,4.533,0.35,5.8923,4.1502,3.0815,2.0566,0.0024,5.1174,6.2537,0.8064,0.0698,0.65,3.1882,4.8811,0.0155,0.0522,0.0536,0.1084,6.6898,0.1047,0.1919,7.8988,6.4828,4.4881,2.7687,1.0704,1.1489,5.0179,4.2169,1.6765,5.1245,2.9202,5.9794,1.0918,1.4988,0.3152,1.204,5.2016,2.8063,0.0043,4.9191,3.3279,3.8828,0.9033,5.5027,2.564,2.2061,5.1322,6.0662,6.8541,3.3541,2.7087,2.4151,0.5465,3.8053,4.6029,0.8256,0.6018,2.3446,0.7684,0.6151,4.383,1.9139]}
{"prompt":"Write a choose your own adventure story with commenters making choices Example in comments .","text":"Write a choose your own adventure story with commenters making choices Example in comments. Choose your own adventure novels usually are quite short, usually written for teenagers or younger children. I read quite a few of these when I was growing up, and I was always mesmerized by them. It\u2019s quite easy to write a short Choose Your Own Adventure, because, once you\u2019ve decided which adventure you want to write, most of the narrative is already done.\nBy the end of this one, you will have the essential tips for putting your thoughts and writing them down into words so that they can be consumed by people. I hope that this article has been useful to you and that you are able to apply it to your own work. Have a great day!\nIf you like short stories, I\u2019d love to hear your suggestions. I\u2019m always looking for more great short stories in this genre!\nI\u2019ve only read one in my entire life and can\u2019t get into it, so I need to find a good one I can like.\nI\u2019ve just finished reading \u2018How to Write a Short Story\u2019 by John Banville. The author was a long lost writer in my school. I discovered it when I read Banville and thought \u2018Ah, good writing again!' He\u2019s a great English teacher.\nI\u2019ve also just begun \u2018A Smooth Operator\u2019 by Alan Garner. I was really taken with it. I love stories that are filled with mystery. You have intrigue. I have to keep stopping to look around and figure out just who the killer is! That\u2019s how I like it!\nIt\u2019s hard to read too many short stories in one sitting, but I would suggest \u2018All the Pretty Little Horses and They\u2019 by Diane Setterfield. She has all kind of magical stories. When I got the book, I was expecting a fairytale. Well, not exactly, but if you\u2019re after a fun read, this is it for you.","token_len":426,"entropy":[4.0641,11.3704,5.8209,1.1226,4.6221,3.9208,3.057,14.8716,9.422,5.498,14.3249,6.7343,6.9734,3.7055,4.5928,0.8147,0.3328,0.3323,10.7479,9.1322,4.2061,5.4265,2.0515,2.0545,4.7641,3.5891,2.2562,4.1354,2.0864,3.7647,3.1227,0.8257,3.6231,3.7365,6.478,0.1151,0.3462,1.8554,1.6618,4.5162,0.3001,0.0617,3.2715,0.0093,1.3739,1.2341,1.3178,3.2238,2.4738,8.4325,0.0377,0.3062,1.5787,0.3258,3.6648,17.2232,7.0978,2.1576,3.5388,2.8695,0.295,2.6116,0.8425,2.9228,9.7392,1.929,0.0782,0.3663,4.5237,4.2267,4.3887,4.4495,0.5066,9.3249,1.2403,1.1316,2.0115,4.2184,1.3479,1.2034,0.3751,0.1924,0.9755,0.5172,6.2937,0.8611,0.4748,8.285,1.8021,2.0396,3.0149,0.6102,3.1328,9.3259,1.8639,2.4035,0.1102,2.8982,5.9709,1.0498,1.2043,1.7373,0.788,4.0899,7.8793,6.3946,1.8893,7.0445,1.7362,5.53,2.1965,5.0245,7.6476,2.3879,4.0086,3.74,4.3366,0.681,1.7791,1.0893,0.7946,6.618,1.3915,5.6651,1.6646,3.1885,2.1354,1.8774,1.5509,2.155,1.6072,2.2593,1.9999,1.1697,0.2592,2.1657,1.5934,0.5167,2.8869,1.8256,0.0068,5.5926,2.2629,0.3921,0.6467,0.2457,3.5377,0.6414,5.4909,1.1638,1.4217,0.5573,0.9897,0.7771,3.635,0.1252,2.4402,9.1284,0.4991,0.6371,2.5272,9.1225,0.3895,2.3123,2.3587,0.5728,0.4318,1.7802,2.3345,1.4724,2.1993,1.8601,0.1073,3.1863,2.4023,1.3635,0.2699,2.7599,3.5908,2.1146,0.1463,4.1083,3.714,2.8836,2.37,1.3524,2.8705,2.5412,0.0415,3.4245,5.1888,1.9497,1.9614,4.6433,1.8417,1.9808,0.2012,2.3408,4.8638,2.0379,0.1844,0.0056,4.12,2.5196,1.8119,2.8272,0.9906,1.0846,6.3668,0.7958,4.0691,1.3063,3.5132,1.2531,4.8668,1.0375,5.544,0.8459,1.7407,1.9086,1.6192,0.0145,2.1592,4.4987,1.4571,1.5238,9.9205,6.5213,7.2742,0.5848,1.4332,0.7466,1.6703,0.1499,3.714,0.4627,2.069,4.3387,7.8659,1.9072,1.2105,3.3208,3.0549,3.5585,1.8454,4.5752,6.8602,4.4766,3.3517,4.3633,4.2875,1.8722,1.7741,7.0958,3.5217,1.6404,0.4371,1.2533,6.0727,0.0176,4.4114,4.4307,4.0469,0.6693,7.0453,0.7713,4.6608,5.3603,7.0879,7.9918,3.9525,0.9414,0.076,0.7463,1.4765,1.6105,6.7409,1.5531,1.7151,1.6974,1.473,1.2108,0.0059,1.5392,2.4458,4.7309,4.9363,6.734,0.2566,3.3054,10.0793,9.8692,0.9105,0.0517,0.1638,5.34,6.3572,0.2992,1.6982,2.8533,3.6888,5.4966,1.2858,2.9974,2.189,1.4263,3.7567,5.3029,1.3675,1.5604,5.4426,0.0185,4.4126,2.3474,4.03,2.8559,14.5484,2.8311,2.4266,2.8254,3.1199,3.6883,8.838,1.5549,2.9484,3.5606,1.9552,4.6944,0.1305,4.8395,3.5306,3.0575,3.849,0.5069,2.949,5.0088,2.2953,0.0511,1.0337,2.7396,0.5435,2.6473,1.4569,1.2855,0.6005,4.4332,0.6007,0.0088,0.0392,3.6073,0.2672,3.7914,3.6809,1.6747,1.0872,0.0337,2.8223,0.566,1.614,1.2516,1.1386,0.8997,4.5037,4.4215,5.7018,0.3674,5.8992,1.9745,4.7623,2.3254,4.2413,4.2797,7.592,1.785,0.1012,0.6316,7.1204,8.9508,4.3371,3.1069,0.2234,2.2393,2.8808,5.3748,7.2494,0.1687,6.1518,1.926,2.1793,5.4543,0.7361,4.3643,2.8379,1.6336,1.361,0.3076,2.0186,5.9968,1.5585,5.8912,2.2204,0.0103,1.9164,3.3541,0.2181,3.2527,3.3681,2.1712,0.7504,4.8617,0.4023,2.5768,0.0796,0.8133,7.1909,1.0597,4.9376,3.4775,0.5399,1.9419,0.5299,1.6717,2.7414,0.0188,0.8075]}

They are quite content without. But if you feel you need to share something, please post it in our online forums. It is there that most of the things I say are explained. Good Luck and keep your eyes open, if you think you might see a Troll around. You could always tell us.\nI have recently ordered a copy of Goblin's IT book and thought the first few chapters were a little confusing. I know there are many things to explain in it. I didn't get to the point where I had to read it all the way though. I just thought it would help if I read along to the sections that I am already familiar with. Does anyone have a section of the book I can go to when I find myself in those situations where I need a little explanation?\nJust had a chance to read your book. There needs to be more emphasis on the more modern systems which we are currently using, like Windows Vista or Windows 7. Your explanations are good but they are still a little outdated. I wouldn't say it is bad but it is a little slow compared to other books out there.\nAlso, there is nothing about the security that the various operating systems give. It is important to note that we can put up a firewall to protect some important systems in our company.\nI want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating this book and for putting your heart and soul into it. This is something that we will all be doing over the coming weeks. It will serve as something to hang onto for a long time. Thank you again.\nAfter using your book with our client we think it is the most comprehensive book we have seen on the subject. Thanks again. Our client plans on purchasing a second copy shortly but first wants you to get some recognition for putting what you do into your book.\nI just purchased your book and wanted to say how it has been a great reference for me. Thanks!

{"prompt":"Our first contact with intelligent life ends up being a little.. underwhelming .","text":"Our first contact with intelligent life ends up being a little.. underwhelming. But that hasn\u2019t stopped me from thinking it might be possible for intelligent life to be found in another planet. As someone who has been very interested in extraterrestrial life, I have searched high and low for evidence of advanced civilisations that have left behind signs of their existence. Some of the evidence I have come across makes me wonder whether there are many more intelligent civilisations out there than we have ever known of.\nAlthough I have not found much evidence of advanced civilisations, there have been a few things that have intrigued me. The first of them has been the existence of a large number of unexplained holes in the stars in the night sky. These stars of our Milky Way galaxy contain huge amounts of metals, and are not thought to be the result of supernovae, so what could have destroyed them? If you have ever wondered what happens to the material that fills the gaps between stars, you have been wondering about the stars you observe in the night sky. One theory is that intelligent life has taken the material from the centre of these holes and used it to power star ships. If this were the case, the stars could be travelling the galaxy at over 200km\/s, and they are still miles from the nearest star.\nAnother interesting thing to have noticed in the sky is the number of supernovae in our galaxy. A supernova is when a star dies and releases all the radiation and energy it uses up. It becomes extremely hot, burning out its outer layers and dying like a candle. Despite the enormous amount of energy which is released, the resulting explosion lasts for only a few minutes. However, these explosions, which are extremely powerful, account for approximately 30% of all stars dying. Why would this rate be so high? The answer may be that it indicates intelligent life is a lot more common in our galaxy than has ever been recognised. There have been many theories proposed as to why there are so many supernovae in the solar neighbourhood, but many of them are too unreliable to be considered a real explanation.","token_len":427,"entropy":[5.429,6.6959,0.4938,12.17,2.2586,9.8393,3.3006,1.0254,2.252,3.7853,10.9216,7.8207,0.28,0.5284,3.8621,3.1651,5.0305,16.6475,8.7121,1.2193,0.6908,1.1972,0.4707,2.8974,4.2601,2.4993,0.991,2.4,2.4207,2.8142,0.2169,0.1716,2.6543,4.6772,1.5002,5.0185,3.0846,0.834,4.791,4.8737,0.1996,1.2354,1.7746,5.2277,2.6232,0.0624,3.45,0.1491,0.3232,1.927,0.6103,2.5056,7.2555,6.4212,0.0279,0.1104,0.4314,2.959,0.7277,6.1698,8.2641,0.3429,1.7885,1.875,5.9187,2.131,4.8524,0.1428,4.4659,1.9579,0.6826,4.4344,1.1626,1.747,2.9694,1.7526,0.6293,2.2051,0.0625,6.0032,1.3998,2.0223,2.4105,2.1553,1.5028,4.112,1.7252,1.4641,6.9215,0.0016,2.0497,0.0092,2.4506,0.8096,1.7446,2.7381,1.3366,5.1271,0.4617,1.9692,9.1229,1.0966,1.6696,2.2284,2.5199,3.4556,0.8622,0.9864,2.7081,1.2152,0.0055,1.0235,2.1045,1.9866,0.1106,2.3485,0.7397,4.8409,0.9511,1.1465,3.1355,0.027,1.0959,2.627,1.1421,2.4873,3.3709,3.1428,0.6368,0.771,4.0778,0.0141,2.0723,4.0869,2.0199,0.0046,7.89,7.7265,0.3928,0.5714,4.3401,2.9425,1.1052,3.6001,0.025,0.5737,1.9372,4.2988,7.1203,4.0712,2.6322,0.004,1.1255,4.4149,4.27,0.6528,0.0012,9.4759,1.4101,2.5824,3.0,4.0174,3.9414,0.0531,0.6306,3.3458,2.9058,0.0032,4.3807,0.6126,0.0528,1.7931,5.08,4.6292,3.8993,2.0992,7.6887,1.0149,0.5201,3.8849,3.3337,2.7696,1.5349,1.8564,1.118,3.8934,1.2383,1.6429,5.2138,1.654,5.0187,1.6074,2.777,1.0135,1.126,0.5867,1.5172,1.8695,2.4113,5.5194,2.846,1.8905,4.4118,5.4169,4.4815,2.16,0.7484,0.2601,0.072,0.3093,4.2647,2.3963,0.9517,0.0581,5.8736,0.0658,2.4107,3.6447,3.0046,2.1424,1.4704,1.2609,8.7203,0.1002,2.6051,1.8921,0.832,3.2244,0.1185,0.3325,4.8437,7.1362,5.2982,0.9243,3.1655,1.3867,1.3652,1.0803,0.0314,0.1894,2.4285,2.2101,3.2974,1.9072,5.0139,4.9448,5.8695,2.0321,4.6425,3.5629,2.7186,0.771,1.4391,1.3069,1.5235,3.3744,3.7394,4.849,8.5299,1.9115,1.2195,3.153,0.4872,0.5047,2.171,2.8641,4.5905,3.3966,2.1562,3.3274,3.0056,2.9045,0.8702,3.1212,0.4138,0.9106,4.6666,0.0526,5.7347,0.1855,0.0139,2.9309,2.3198,1.0577,0.3072,4.0414,2.0397,0.0894,1.1062,2.4688,0.855,2.1427,4.4782,1.7718,4.1126,3.9286,1.256,4.3445,3.6963,1.8403,1.6074,7.0287,3.2365,0.7736,2.7309,7.2565,3.9617,1.8161,1.3262,6.2308,3.9142,3.5975,4.1789,0.4643,1.3237,5.9237,4.4666,0.6854,4.6652,0.778,7.3805,1.4105,4.8183,1.2484,0.0145,1.1595,6.1135,2.0044,1.0104,1.1734,1.2653,5.9094,2.8873,6.5414,0.7524,2.4001,0.4289,0.3686,1.4305,0.8347,4.4534,0.1441,4.24,2.6634,4.5293,1.8002,1.1651,3.4996,2.0518,0.452,9.2688,0.0051,5.7928,3.526,0.3385,0.0318,0.9498,4.7244,5.5493,1.2826,5.4964,2.2799,2.9689,7.3798,1.1175,0.236,0.2638,0.3768,2.295,2.0609,3.2671,1.1794,0.7175,3.77,7.4519,4.8689,0.0321,1.2732,5.3148,3.3028,0.5738,3.0348,1.0485,1.2596,0.2395,0.4753,5.2954,2.8656,0.0407,5.5471,0.5626,3.727,2.1038,0.172,2.2467,1.9541,4.5058,1.7994,0.0777,0.3508,3.2942,0.8723,0.8456,0.1924,0.5592,0.0468,0.0163,0.7903,1.0021,7.1722,8.1394,1.3397,0.7345,4.6102,0.7853,0.9952,1.4823,4.8166,6.8381,0.4439,0.7559,3.155,3.5817,3.6555,2.1151,0.49]}

Because it is your duty to be happy.","token_len":427,"entropy":[4.9492,3.1109,1.1227,8.1989,3.2282,0.4614,4.0932,0.5865,2.2224,5.1595,2.6519,3.9361,3.7043,2.169,0.8076,4.4639,5.5751,3.3391,3.1659,2.0989,5.2601,1.5824,0.4631,6.304,1.571,2.0555,2.0357,1.8947,2.38,3.6773,6.0716,1.0119,4.471,8.0061,0.2199,3.9481,2.993,0.338,6.1005,5.9717,0.6647,2.4658,4.5236,1.0831,3.6594,4.2002,3.752,4.5391,0.6285,1.2125,8.8134,1.8039,3.5388,4.1415,4.0786,2.7616,4.2169,2.1322,0.2755,4.0063,0.8701,1.7357,3.8468,1.6051,3.4448,1.9119,4.2138,1.5118,5.02,5.1924,0.233,2.2189,1.9911,2.8019,1.0805,1.8862,5.1551,1.4653,0.6677,1.5768,3.8875,2.2995,4.4103,2.5687,0.8324,2.467,2.321,5.0881,1.0436,5.3199,1.4101,5.2698,4.0704,4.6083,4.8692,1.1638,1.7752,5.4958,0.4522,1.5753,6.9634,2.1408,2.0144,6.5582,0.4115,4.2658,8.3684,1.2896,4.1479,5.2797,3.1916,4.7289,2.8195,4.4722,3.0223,7.4323,6.0624,0.4506,7.4513,3.9398,3.0501,3.8775,0.7211,0.3806,3.4301,5.5643,2.2678,0.1745,4.5029,4.6939,5.2097,4.1211,4.9154,2.2121,2.9005,3.5805,2.8904,1.8965,4.1754,3.7846,0.9135,1.2591,1.0354,0.5558,1.5846,4.388,1.9685,0.006,1.5099,3.4468,2.0714,4.228,1.97,2.6802,0.2307,3.8294,1.6098,8.6195,0.4433,0.879,6.1803,0.4011,1.4144,0.4772,6.1089,0.5285,6.011,1.0204,2.5538,3.5848,3.9379,4.1442,6.2026,4.6705,2.0158,4.1633,0.3601,4.2951,0.677,2.2809,5.3714,6.4386,0.3095,3.1982,2.9264,4.7773,3.9787,2.4258,4.8161,3.8068,0.6572,3.6148,0.2891,2.7151,2.8769,2.7558,4.7701,1.5147,1.3384,5.4083,2.3513,1.332,1.6562,0.9536,3.7481,0.9824,0.0993,4.1823,0.0054,0.0827,0.6456,5.0862,6.9401,4.8449,1.9806,1.0399,4.3031,0.5521,3.7384,1.2167,2.9167,2.5946,1.2634,1.0872,2.3318,7.4932,2.0711,3.6791,1.3228,0.3026,1.9748,1.2282,5.2327,3.2732,1.6683,0.9874,1.1687,5.9873,3.4145,4.8957,5.4979,0.7259,4.2176,0.8461,1.5457,0.4232,2.6345,3.7311,3.3901,6.5916,2.6722,1.5027,1.923,2.3581,3.2944,2.3488,1.673,2.448,0.0434,2.9234,1.0624,6.9115,2.2239,1.0325,0.4096,0.5951,4.9929,2.9215,0.3841,6.3552,1.7903,0.3003,2.8026,2.5562,1.6357,1.7558,1.6652,0.2836,0.2946,3.9222,2.9659,1.0757,3.1685,5.6484,0.9968,5.7698,0.2472,2.0221,5.6745,3.8528,0.1435,3.9833,3.0847,0.4723,0.4618,2.0798,3.1375,6.2604,0.8578,4.0633,6.1302,7.4073,2.097,1.5971,4.9482,3.4799,6.9419,2.0353,4.5576,2.0521,1.5288,7.0121,4.7843,3.2744,0.1504,0.6863,0.4785,1.5812,1.1778,6.7349,0.3807,2.947,4.3369,0.8358,2.3221,3.0768,3.1631,2.4951,0.1397,4.3384,2.6358,4.2808,1.6519,0.6416,0.9018,3.0578,1.0414,3.5198,0.2405,6.3068,3.6583,13.0218,0.1559,2.0338,1.1604,3.1537,4.2222,3.0268,3.5932,0.7819,1.598,2.2438,6.6794,1.0152,1.1793,1.836,2.9921,0.7865,0.6165,2.7937,1.6802,3.536,0.8189,5.6584,1.6313,1.896,2.0644,1.1595,0.3628,1.1411,4.0015,2.7627,4.8753,4.7627,0.5901,2.0534,5.6335,1.2798,1.4737,8.3055,0.1454,1.0915,3.0862,0.2341,0.6978,1.7633,0.7897,0.9867,1.0313,0.3786,0.2112,1.5639,0.1389,0.836,3.2994,0.9949,4.8068,0.7827,1.4575,2.4523,6.1539,3.1138,3.0647,1.7294,3.1332,2.7393,0.4346,0.2985,4.2943,2.4259,4.1036,0.275,0.4606,1.1441,3.0545,4.5898,6.1235,5.5443,2.9297,0.4607,2.9156,3.0646,0.2801,3.838,3.6249,1.2119]}

{"prompt":"You just received a letter from `` your future self '' , featuring a set of weirdly specific instructions . There is no explanation on why you should follow the instructions , or what the possible outcome would be .","text":"You just received a letter from `` your future self '', featuring a set of weirdly specific instructions. There is no explanation on why you should follow the instructions, or what the possible outcome would be. What does it mean that you should watch this movie? What do you get out of it? As a first response you can either believe the crazy idea that somebody actually wrote you a letter or simply ignore it and move on. The latter is what I would recommend. This message has one important meaning to this guy right now, and it can be quite tricky to interpret it, even for someone familiar with tarot. The card shown in the message can also guide his life and it is a good approach to decipher this tarot reading properly.\nThe deck shown in this reading is Rider Waite Sculpture. This deck is one of the most old tarot decks and it has some very peculiar features that will prove useful for the interpretation of this message. In this tarot reading the top card is of 2 of Cups, and in that decks interpretation it is also associated with a possible break up, or loss. The card below is 9 of Diamonds, a card associated with a big change, of course not a loss but a positive one, and this is followed by 5 of Wands, a card of hope, a hope that something nice will happen. The card shown on the fifth position is 4 of Clubs, a trump suit and a card of a partnership with an unknown person that you can only guess is male. The card shown on the sixth position is 6 of Wands, a card of a positive thing, of course you can only hope. The card shown on the last position is 5 of Swords, a card associated with a possible break up, but just like in a Tarot reading where you see the last card as an omen a card you can use in your favor, this one shows another possible ending that you would be better off not to follow. This reading shows a message that is trying to help you, to remind you of your choices, which are also the choices you will make later.","token_len":428,"entropy":[5.6202,7.1365,1.3306,3.3109,0.5916,13.8926,10.6048,7.4455,4.3751,4.5669,3.9836,8.7594,1.3537,7.5933,0.09,8.4669,3.6535,5.8959,4.4,2.0899,4.8905,1.4929,0.8505,3.8766,3.9963,3.1169,1.2415,3.2938,4.3512,2.2991,0.7401,1.4019,2.1964,1.7759,2.3226,6.2392,4.6019,1.8965,0.0374,0.5668,3.971,3.3628,1.4413,0.6914,3.1087,0.7699,1.6224,6.4816,1.8613,2.4213,1.2311,2.8386,2.2136,0.185,4.2311,1.1391,0.0248,0.5963,0.4097,5.5432,1.7875,6.2969,4.3932,4.1364,2.8198,4.7243,5.5115,2.4672,7.7274,5.137,1.0668,6.6507,5.1902,3.7957,2.3218,1.4893,0.8337,1.5027,4.2245,2.8956,0.4449,2.3478,5.1579,0.0676,0.6355,3.0054,3.3403,0.9879,3.1577,1.4331,2.3967,2.4113,0.9877,4.1796,6.0977,2.9602,6.5698,3.462,3.7602,3.868,4.8829,5.1862,6.7725,0.3458,2.0211,0.876,1.2238,4.2209,1.0433,5.0702,6.2863,0.5892,3.9133,3.6024,3.3766,3.5184,1.3143,1.8672,6.4661,0.0231,9.6158,0.0544,1.0852,2.8859,7.4502,6.1449,1.8302,0.6541,3.5839,4.115,3.4109,8.072,6.7629,4.1764,2.7357,5.1476,1.4433,2.7094,1.9327,6.7475,1.0798,6.3493,4.7464,6.6322,0.0006,5.3442,9.7221,0.2042,2.3735,3.7847,6.4171,5.4398,0.8749,1.5029,7.8506,0.7539,15.3244,9.3725,2.6516,9.2976,3.0287,0.4771,1.7794,2.59,1.8341,1.1531,3.9236,0.191,0.8741,1.4299,7.8594,3.9446,0.0041,1.6827,4.1435,2.1139,1.9778,3.7512,2.2085,4.9436,1.6304,2.2645,3.8603,5.7783,1.5162,1.4577,3.2703,5.8297,0.274,1.158,1.873,0.1951,3.5887,1.5539,4.5973,0.0007,0.8145,2.3651,5.0166,1.5361,1.2528,4.5883,6.9323,5.0088,12.3379,1.6585,2.1822,2.0824,5.1925,8.0752,8.7499,7.4635,0.6671,4.2729,6.2255,0.0515,2.4701,7.4854,7.684,3.8596,3.5823,2.8799,4.7859,2.3442,1.7401,3.0526,3.8364,1.429,8.1273,2.1409,6.8845,0.536,0.5541,4.4166,2.8053,5.9001,0.0678,1.4631,6.7286,5.1147,2.9116,5.422,3.0023,6.2264,1.8055,3.2372,3.4681,1.035,6.7941,2.0994,2.1949,1.4645,2.4342,1.4377,5.7001,0.1115,4.6754,0.5305,6.4306,1.2388,1.1218,2.368,0.217,4.2982,6.7953,1.0914,2.3224,7.3301,1.6749,5.9008,6.7462,1.4519,0.999,1.6153,1.5275,2.0577,3.391,3.2373,0.3746,8.9514,7.4146,0.9133,4.41,0.2607,3.5111,0.2643,1.6041,10.7601,10.5705,3.2838,1.0645,2.1025,0.829,4.12,8.7418,3.4621,3.2681,2.9723,2.4818,4.1706,3.8877,2.0373,3.7378,1.308,2.5936,7.4337,0.4473,1.2856,1.0045,0.9547,0.6399,0.0388,1.2494,0.2939,0.1082,2.7747,0.07,3.6194,0.1018,0.265,0.5384,1.0237,0.6607,2.0108,5.9515,5.8933,0.9509,3.1831,0.9627,3.5805,0.5206,0.4896,5.7168,3.4011,0.8929,0.5314,0.3012,0.2127,0.0167,4.8988,0.2276,0.1017,2.1892,0.0342,5.1147,0.1238,0.2983,0.2791,2.5719,0.0132,0.4152,3.2764,0.4483,0.2011,0.6252,3.5246,6.3985,2.6965,1.9087,3.2335,4.1243,0.0023,0.7429,5.4814,1.4613,4.2314,1.7892,5.397,1.0645,4.8893,3.3573,5.8501,0.5813,5.6215,4.2764,5.3286,1.133,5.5372,3.7454,1.3601,7.0363,1.9623,2.1047,2.9801,3.3256,5.561,2.8349,5.375,3.0939,1.6693,4.1555,3.0221,2.7604,0.1236,2.6935,2.7233,1.6773,0.4911,2.6066,4.7287,3.594,1.9669,5.2438,1.2233,1.797,8.2043,0.0435,3.1567,0.4526,2.2878,3.8806,4.8752,0.0431,1.1714,2.1802,3.928,1.1584,4.2321,2.7683,3.8154,3.5572,6.2279,0.9271,2.844,0.6764,3.7775,1.4927]}
{"prompt":"When a person dies , their memories get wiped , and they get sent back to earth , to be reborn . Problem is , they forgot to wipe yours .","text":"When a person dies, their memories get wiped, and they get sent back to earth, to be reborn. Problem is, they forgot to wipe yours. Now, they\u2019re trying to get you here, so you can remember what happened in heaven, because if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t remember them after they\u2019re reborn.\nMiriam said something that you said, and it just didn\u2019t go away. If you\u2019re saying that God will not come back, that means that they will come here for us. We\u2019ll be reborn when we wake up.\nI had an experience with my cat when I was pregnant. It was a black cat. It came and sat beside the bed in the morning and never left. After I got married, she came to my bed and sat there the whole morning. Then a day or two ago, I had a bad dream. I kept dreaming that the cat was eating me. All of a sudden, a friend of mine knocked on my door and said, \u2018Hey, is your cat coming back tonight? It\u2019s been missing all morning.\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s been missing, and not here.\u2019 Then I was woken up. I had this very vivid dream of all of my fingers being caught in my cat. She kept me up all night.\nSo, it didn\u2019t go away. But, if you\u2019re saying God won\u2019t come back, then they\u2019ll come here to keep you. If you don\u2019t believe in God, what do you believe in? They can\u2019t exist after you die. All this is just some sort of a belief, and what happens to the belief is, if you can\u2019t put into place a way of life where it\u2019s not based on religion, eventually that belief is going to be destroyed until you\u2019re left with nothing. And, when there\u2019s nothing anymore, if you wake up tomorrow morning, then you have nothing.","token_len":430,"entropy":[3.591,3.2792,4.3443,0.8734,2.9285,4.9281,5.1407,3.032,3.638,1.1031,1.6739,3.7093,4.6513,0.9016,0.2795,4.708,2.1623,3.863,3.2073,1.6214,1.7607,10.4149,0.4626,0.2022,2.094,8.0841,1.5655,3.7894,10.3395,1.0168,4.7203,1.3141,2.3402,17.6379,9.4438,2.2923,4.6196,0.0818,3.059,2.1733,6.0409,1.5964,2.8264,1.5084,0.5464,4.5111,2.0068,0.4355,3.364,4.7429,1.825,4.7805,3.5934,0.5211,1.7041,2.6854,0.728,0.147,4.3715,3.8194,0.2065,0.0225,0.2062,2.8137,5.0605,6.0575,2.2702,1.9395,0.0104,0.7165,3.6569,0.8557,2.2636,11.9835,2.705,4.4696,4.0136,3.0008,4.2098,5.3426,2.7378,1.3355,2.5154,4.9468,3.6947,0.1103,0.11,0.4136,3.3895,1.2818,0.4097,4.6397,0.5728,3.1938,0.0413,0.6412,6.0784,1.2867,5.5137,3.6237,3.2491,4.4007,1.0287,1.1432,3.1982,3.1964,0.7485,3.2399,2.0015,3.9981,5.3042,4.283,4.1856,1.6348,4.4119,3.2656,0.0745,1.65,2.0332,4.0646,4.8953,1.1192,6.1797,0.052,1.0814,1.3543,3.3536,4.5215,3.78,3.0427,1.3488,2.7262,6.5358,3.0521,0.7663,0.3125,2.9307,1.0929,2.6049,0.6522,1.7649,6.0249,0.3856,1.6561,1.4617,3.6716,2.9984,1.75,4.5846,3.2669,1.7933,3.3085,1.1825,3.7267,2.1088,5.747,1.7608,0.3804,4.4443,1.9865,2.1343,4.3225,0.4322,2.2246,2.4332,1.9648,2.1243,3.5229,1.0459,1.7687,2.2428,6.5224,0.2213,4.3815,1.2882,3.3051,5.419,3.262,1.6167,0.1858,4.0852,0.4418,2.0816,3.4152,1.1236,4.3805,1.1823,0.9168,1.112,5.6797,4.3281,2.3503,2.589,0.598,1.3225,5.6455,2.6251,0.9838,5.5626,1.3308,0.0909,0.0002,0.4969,3.8399,5.8456,0.6803,0.1666,5.5031,0.2193,0.3739,0.1994,0.7622,0.7866,0.3813,7.8941,8.2193,4.3098,0.3646,4.6742,3.4596,0.1411,3.418,1.4171,6.1803,0.2485,3.8028,2.8334,0.3955,1.1574,4.4069,6.2849,2.8998,2.6933,0.4896,4.8782,0.242,1.8504,2.1519,0.2498,1.7858,0.8875,3.8491,1.4355,0.0449,0.0695,1.8819,0.79,3.2788,1.4119,7.7089,4.633,0.7787,1.7195,0.0883,3.2434,1.4383,3.633,6.9321,0.0241,0.1596,1.9819,1.1266,3.1736,3.7626,4.391,3.3535,0.3621,2.5621,5.5188,0.7107,3.2922,9.609,2.7188,5.447,0.5755,1.8997,2.2618,3.3784,4.3337,4.2423,5.5362,3.4965,1.2453,0.1107,1.6085,1.7835,3.8306,1.3162,3.5111,3.941,0.1563,0.0821,0.1643,1.5323,0.0199,0.4313,3.1552,1.5472,2.1594,0.5558,2.924,0.0276,0.1156,1.3369,3.8654,2.625,0.2884,0.005,0.0028,0.0262,0.0473,0.3421,1.7171,3.7278,1.1645,0.0095,1.8121,0.2438,1.6783,2.814,5.0257,0.5511,2.5431,3.0921,0.4709,1.9637,0.0483,0.0065,0.002,2.0284,2.4958,0.7278,0.2356,6.0017,1.1834,0.0321,2.3028,1.0121,0.4474,3.4185,4.0043,0.793,0.0208,0.0208,6.1912,4.926,1.186,1.5346,0.6106,5.4811,4.6809,1.7385,2.4159,5.2888,2.987,0.0011,4.6768,6.3477,2.3393,1.5004,4.614,3.226,1.77,2.6868,4.8717,2.1274,3.1732,1.8052,0.5555,4.9147,1.4153,0.0095,0.0019,5.8122,4.3045,4.461,1.3473,3.0859,1.881,2.5035,3.7761,4.2892,2.2058,0.0107,0.2135,2.3378,5.049,0.1264,3.8269,0.3643,8.4828,2.8924,1.0157,2.8992,2.1291,0.0634,2.1072,2.0463,7.9813,1.6298,2.3048,0.015,0.1695,6.0773,3.218,1.6678,0.8208,2.8356,2.3571,3.8743,5.4292,1.5987,0.0126,1.873,1.3371,7.0602,0.2865,4.4219,0.4338,8.9786,0.0129,4.473,2.0367,0.8342,2.6507,0.9358,3.2641,1.0147,1.3727]}

You are put on the case to find said fugitive. When given a list of all the people he has known, you are told not to check any names, as they are not in the system. You know one of the names, however. As the case progresses, you discover several other names. The person in question has been in some trouble, and you need to figure out which of the other names belong to the fugitive. How have you decided?\nWe\u2019re glad to announce that we have a new addition to our catalog! The Dungeon Master\u2019s Caution is a small, hardback with some great art and an explanation of the classic campaign setting. I thought this would go well next to the classic campaign setting and help introduce them to the first D&D adventure. The price is right, at $15.00, as a lot of this sort of thing was once very expensive, but we\u2019ve been able to get them down to reasonable prices with our ebook format.\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our product line. In preparation for our upcoming release on the official website, we\u2019ll have all our ebooks for D&D 3.0 and Pathfinder available. So check back later and give us feedback, as we have several upgrades coming.\nAll right folks, let\u2019s start the campaign again. Last session we had one of the players leave the party for the day, and that brought the group into a lot of trouble. Now though it\u2019s been a minute since we met so we\u2019ll get going with a quick bit of discussion about the next chapter.\nOnce again we have a short introduction to the player characters and their current situation. They are now at Bountiful Castle, near the Drain of Desolation. They were supposed to be taking a rest, but as most of them do after a hard day of exploring with little sleep and very little food, they have become restless and impatient. They\u2019ve decided that they are coming after their goal and that it must be met now.","token_len":430,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,7.9675,12.1234,8.9777,0.0017,1.078,6.6219,1.7564,1.9597,1.3857,8.3155,1.7275,1.5934,2.1006,3.3597,2.9218,9.4376,0.1083,0.7635,4.2219,7.4789,1.5771,5.7599,0.1528,3.4463,1.1257,2.3209,3.2814,1.6473,3.8052,1.234,1.2504,2.2272,2.0733,4.7148,0.109,7.3635,2.9625,4.4,2.4049,3.921,1.619,1.2434,2.6231,3.8969,1.1578,5.0289,0.6273,1.8533,4.5159,5.6898,1.9335,1.0013,1.9894,2.0061,4.8367,1.8574,4.8467,2.6625,2.6399,1.0854,0.4437,0.6754,2.677,5.1226,2.3543,1.1087,1.8761,2.9235,4.7984,3.2593,0.4593,2.2974,1.9153,3.6702,4.5976,3.6244,1.49,1.242,1.0448,3.8937,0.5139,4.7093,0.0357,3.4598,1.6766,1.847,2.1613,0.5348,6.8123,0.088,1.7629,1.4244,0.341,5.1907,5.9587,0.2124,4.6318,3.1379,2.501,10.0794,15.9296,9.7595,3.8805,6.6645,1.0553,4.4681,0.3977,1.7594,0.9499,3.8248,2.295,4.9147,0.2233,0.7385,5.7246,2.5632,3.1625,10.6247,1.4923,5.3427,0.3369,1.2716,11.9722,2.043,3.0057,2.2583,5.1598,2.2485,4.8616,6.3911,6.1404,4.9258,3.1296,2.7838,1.7062,3.8124,5.9196,0.2178,1.088,7.1099,6.5788,1.7643,0.6124,5.3191,5.0919,2.3446,1.686,6.8506,1.1903,8.5476,2.2437,1.1175,5.2983,1.6096,0.1753,3.0357,6.3988,4.033,5.0355,0.2048,1.3758,5.6032,5.7403,0.304,0.0053,3.0959,1.5488,2.6987,7.9659,1.0531,3.8298,1.485,5.513,0.9022,3.0898,0.481,1.3207,2.6,4.7375,2.9543,6.6952,0.0837,3.7421,6.6772,0.0343,2.4668,4.079,4.8873,5.4167,1.5917,2.1871,1.032,2.6477,8.5987,0.2323,2.5718,2.684,1.1335,0.0042,2.1541,4.5461,4.9182,0.298,7.2134,0.9119,3.7638,2.8269,9.9091,5.8563,0.6248,2.1254,2.754,1.3141,0.0584,1.7904,1.3307,5.3768,1.9586,6.1341,0.8711,3.1211,3.5909,6.9204,0.1029,2.1297,2.6789,2.7517,3.8592,1.7666,6.0615,1.8333,0.3736,0.4013,1.7945,0.1665,2.6393,2.9065,6.1422,2.9005,6.7693,0.3156,4.5453,6.9709,0.1301,0.0007,4.2631,1.0381,1.3078,2.3038,3.8225,4.6725,1.9147,3.9211,4.4661,1.8885,4.2643,3.0268,4.2781,0.6965,3.288,2.8763,2.8964,0.9121,2.4626,5.0154,10.0381,2.5941,2.7825,0.8722,5.0258,5.018,4.9057,0.3177,2.2524,2.8998,0.4023,0.3485,2.4465,2.4806,3.2896,4.7316,1.2572,7.061,7.7057,1.6245,2.0702,4.379,1.1106,0.5569,5.1047,4.7583,1.5198,2.0688,3.0174,2.1318,2.8663,1.55,1.1914,3.7135,5.5056,2.3698,4.1435,3.0046,1.9509,5.9533,0.1074,0.3791,0.2714,4.0082,7.0698,3.98,2.8875,0.1512,0.4589,3.8189,1.9821,9.4671,2.4153,0.9174,5.1549,5.2855,2.2753,1.2062,0.0634,0.5612,3.0705,4.1584,3.09,2.7204,3.079,5.9442,0.1418,5.0403,2.4786,1.5658,3.6232,3.2325,0.7467,1.0354,5.1175,1.4317,1.9684,1.8089,1.4911,5.4349,3.5531,0.6339,0.7012,6.0308,2.4152,1.9702,2.2467,5.9755,2.2309,0.6018,3.3525,1.3246,3.2724,4.4782,9.5181,3.3008,0.1825,6.3419,1.0128,5.6423,0.8641,11.5464,3.7824,7.0044,0.49,1.0923,2.3986,3.5702,4.7481,0.0032,1.1977,4.9204,1.635,4.594,1.6743,0.4644,3.8877,6.0397,0.4797,0.935,4.973,6.5959,1.8,5.6679,0.4534,1.3337,4.6603,5.1023,4.8449,4.1502,3.0559,5.9363,0.3991,1.1953,0.6135,0.554,2.3169,3.4955,2.603,0.9646,5.9138,0.3673,1.9455,4.0888,0.1713,1.5259,2.763,2.1384,1.1723,2.0706,5.247,5.2347,3.1601,6.8765,2.9249,2.438,2.4659,3.674,0.1957,4.6219,4.9464,0.3155]}

Outside, they begin to discuss what they just saw... Then one says: \"You, you are the Christ... For you were born the Son of God \". This is the King who is so desired, and in fact Jesus said: \" There are three things of which I am afraid : the sword, the famine, and the plague. If the one of those things becomes possible and kills me, yet the Father, who gave me life, has given me the right to be risen again.. So, I am not afraid that this sword can kill me. I do not care for the famine, because everyone must eat... I do not think about the plague, because even a bad plague is a thousand times better than the plague that I see before me from the power and the glory of the coming King. For when I saw Him, I fell down with my face to the ground. This King is a Prince royal, a King who is loved even by the Jewish leaders, and also he is an angry King with the Gentiles ; he has made his enemies to be like his slaves.\nAfter Jesus said this, the three Wise Men returned to Jerusalem, to tell King Herod what they just saw, and then they also took three gifts, the money, frankincense and myrrh.\nIf you would have seen the Kings from the Old Testament, you would say : \" Oh how wonderful they are!... I do not understand why God gives rewards to kings. I do not understand why he allows them to harm his people and have blood on their hands.. So, all the kings in our Old Testament are wicked, no doubt!! \"..\nBut you would be wrong!! These kings were really good kings. Just check the facts.. The first King ever known in history, God gave him his throne, his kingdom and all his authority.. This was King David, the great King of Kings!\nIn the Old Testament, there were no kings who did not do right by God, until the time the Messiah came, who gave us His own King and King of Kings!","token_len":430,"entropy":[6.8659,11.4204,1.5127,7.4578,4.4226,8.614,2.5644,4.3625,2.5022,9.511,1.3533,1.6505,7.4997,0.4664,4.4409,2.6532,1.9215,5.8857,1.4582,6.1197,5.3892,3.9117,5.5121,2.6764,0.4954,2.8892,5.0151,4.5464,3.3868,2.5594,5.2724,4.2913,5.9661,1.6866,2.5856,3.1315,4.5129,0.7679,0.0901,0.1338,10.7784,3.403,1.0346,1.4044,7.3897,3.7597,2.8774,5.9619,8.7392,2.2697,1.7101,4.7705,3.7905,4.3776,4.5597,1.8398,0.2338,8.6465,1.652,1.6374,2.9228,4.5833,0.9753,0.419,1.2582,5.3883,4.9939,2.6299,6.4632,0.5403,0.1432,9.3134,0.3694,0.111,0.1354,2.4021,1.6678,3.9809,3.1336,4.4269,2.6359,3.1707,0.8884,6.1043,6.2073,3.9386,6.3417,2.4528,0.3752,6.8879,1.3842,9.3483,3.5263,1.763,3.8928,0.563,1.4514,0.3956,3.978,2.3672,0.4082,2.5504,4.1452,0.2778,2.8421,6.5897,0.8748,7.3885,4.2673,2.3082,2.4109,2.5628,3.7486,0.5167,3.86,3.1987,3.3602,4.2291,1.2301,0.2091,1.2936,1.8731,3.1475,0.0523,4.6348,2.1792,1.3412,3.8718,1.0785,2.6166,7.8636,4.2395,1.9874,5.4099,2.3512,1.1332,0.0439,4.9207,3.9171,0.3763,0.3251,0.689,0.0557,4.9569,4.0402,5.7841,2.0844,2.0001,2.4347,6.6266,0.3038,2.7086,0.3027,2.2264,5.2793,2.8665,2.9486,2.8171,4.4372,0.2063,6.5309,1.1223,6.7388,4.3835,1.9843,1.9826,0.0948,1.3221,9.1327,3.8338,1.4176,3.43,3.8957,1.0221,1.8104,6.1877,0.9239,0.3679,5.7756,2.3416,3.0261,3.0637,2.1657,1.825,0.317,0.6646,1.5331,4.5606,4.8232,1.9669,3.3171,7.3366,12.7293,1.0076,2.5617,1.9664,1.7228,1.6078,5.2557,5.632,0.8469,1.2171,6.7636,6.3775,1.495,1.236,4.9256,4.3534,0.7712,4.9997,5.8295,2.5782,3.9324,2.563,4.1838,0.015,7.2895,2.1631,2.3526,3.2135,3.0183,2.332,3.6583,2.4181,4.7548,2.8674,6.193,1.3512,4.8163,6.5467,2.5002,3.5684,0.8656,0.4944,1.3024,2.5523,0.1877,0.0065,5.6761,0.4462,2.4385,1.548,3.9346,4.1863,5.4414,1.6908,2.7639,1.2683,4.214,0.3278,2.1379,0.4939,3.5291,1.3997,5.942,4.0396,5.9012,5.142,2.2242,2.8299,5.7234,1.1377,9.6354,0.0099,0.0,1.4377,7.1509,0.3899,0.0073,1.0655,2.3723,5.2133,0.7993,3.8663,3.0326,3.4711,1.6529,8.3132,4.8308,1.2449,6.6205,0.4056,0.5956,0.7716,0.3877,6.2716,5.2774,0.4552,5.0513,5.0805,3.6069,3.6109,0.6309,1.6092,8.844,2.7659,4.0046,0.0505,3.5085,2.454,4.0792,3.6291,7.6814,0.9741,2.9959,2.7318,2.738,1.7303,0.0239,0.8993,0.1981,2.395,5.1075,1.4781,0.1278,7.5935,3.4024,0.7155,3.1679,5.1133,6.5819,1.271,0.246,0.6941,5.5289,3.8853,0.7275,4.9872,2.2212,2.3427,3.3969,5.5502,6.7539,0.0957,1.665,4.705,1.44,6.124,2.6173,8.687,2.0938,7.7756,2.3989,3.3462,3.423,2.2792,2.578,0.7539,5.3667,5.3026,3.9894,2.0832,4.6846,3.9154,2.9408,1.6209,5.9872,6.7202,1.4435,4.2187,5.3086,2.3109,3.786,2.5426,7.3241,5.4895,3.9148,2.5654,2.382,6.2825,3.113,1.6672,3.9318,3.8036,1.8395,3.0196,2.5085,1.733,2.3621,1.198,5.6725,3.8823,3.618,2.0173,3.7204,2.2569,1.3136,1.7711,3.5613,2.1926,0.5549,3.4805,5.2496,1.9469,3.5552,1.2468,1.909,0.0286,0.557,3.262,1.6831,2.9677,0.8432,3.0204,3.5291,0.3169,4.6899,5.432,2.5021,2.3688,1.8224,5.9471,1.6506,1.9097,3.6824,3.2049,0.8507,2.5099,3.2545,3.429,3.5246,4.1821,4.4184,5.0143,2.7974,2.8494,0.8564,0.3346,2.9355]}
{"prompt":"Humans have finally reached the edge of the universe . Tell what they see .","text":"Humans have finally reached the edge of the universe. Tell what they see. Is it beautiful or a curse?\nA video that was viewed more than 10 million times on Snapchat has gotten people talking, including a lot about the color of the star. The stars around which the video is filmed are the brightest stars in the universe. This is the largest star cluster in our universe and can be seen with the naked human eye. At this time, the most powerful telescope that could make the video was used.\nThe human brain still faces some challenges, which can be seen in this video. Although the video is too unreal and not convincing, it can be seen that the technology level in these days is far beyond our imagination. Therefore, if you are familiar with the technology of these days, then you can see the future of technology in the video below, and I hope you can guess what it can be. At the same time, in general, a video like this has been considered as a \u201cgood news for science.\u201d\nIn the video above, a telescope is seen moving at a high speed, but not in space, it looks like the movement was made by a ship on the bottom so that it could move even faster than the speed of sound. At this time, the speed of sound is only about 300,000 kilometers per hour, but the speed of the telescope is about 5 million kilometers per hour, which makes the moving process difficult to imagine. However, this type of technology certainly opens up a new direction of technology that is completely alien to modern technology. At the same time, the human body also takes a hit with this type of technology.

{"prompt":"God reveals themselves to exist and confirms they did create your world . This is all fine and dandy until you start exploring space and find other worlds have their own , equally egotistical gods .","text":"God reveals themselves to exist and confirms they did create your world. This is all fine and dandy until you start exploring space and find other worlds have their own, equally egotistical gods. You feel this a little odd, because there really should only be one God who created everything, but you don\u2019t have the luxury of deciding that. You are told who you are, where you live, what you look like and who the great gods are. There\u2019s something slightly bizarre about this that doesn\u2019t feel true and your first impulse is to find an explanation, that makes everything make sense.\nYour world is populated by half-human beings, half-aliens. Being half human, you are still limited in terms of your abilities and your powers. You can still fly and walk on water, but there is also a large difference between the types of abilities you can do and ones humans can usually only dream of. Most of the abilities of the human race have been taken over by aliens and your people are now basically robots. You are however, given a few basic abilities just not that advanced ones. As a matter of fact most abilities that the human race used are gone at this point in history and have been replaced by your own technology. You also have to be careful if you can even speak the language you were born with and if you can understand what is going on around you. This is due to the fact that it is all done through the use of electronic communications and it is not quite clear if humans can understand this language. You are also given some basic understanding of a few other languages, which also helps you get around a little easier. The only way you can communicate between people is through a device on a belt on your hip. You also receive a headset that can be used to hear what is going on and a small bag that can hold electronics. These electronics are used to collect data and send it back to a base for processing. It seems as if the aliens might use the data as they need it.

{"prompt":"A classic Disney movie , but the protagonist is now the villian","text":"A classic Disney movie, but the protagonist is now the villian?\nI\u2019m really enjoying this movie, I read it in a book format as a Christmas read, but I haven\u2019t read a Disney movie yet which is why I decided to watch it from this website.\nI was so excited when I picked this one up, as I had not read it in the past, but I was pretty disappointed, and it felt a bit repetitive. I wasn\u2019t bothered by a lot of the storytelling as it wasn\u2019t very complex and I didn\u2019t have problems with the story line but the characters could of done with being a little more interesting, especially some of the others.\nIt\u2019s been a fair while since I saw this movie with my older children (7 and 9) and it was so hard to get the same magic we first experienced before (we didn\u2019t have an I-Pad at the time)! And I don\u2019t have to say that the original song is a brilliant movie and a little reminder of joyful childhood memories for me at every moment!\nI was really interested in watching this for the first time because, like you said, the name had not entered any of my consciousness. I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all by the film as I thought it to be a good family entertainment movie.\nThis is one of my daughters favorite movies, although she was hesitant to go because it wasn\u2019t a Disney movie. She loved the storyline and was amazed that it was a movie!\nThis movie had some good memories from my childhood and is one that I will definitely watch again. The scenes with the animals and the song were really fun and it was a great movie to watch!\nWow, I loved what I saw. I saw it with my family on Christmas which is always a great family movie. We also went together with the kindergarteners and the teachers as they didn\u2019t all believe in Santa Claus. Overall, a great movie for the whole family and the kids were thrilled with it. I\u2019m so glad you recommend it!","token_len":433,"entropy":[9.755,8.1506,2.0133,1.6437,3.3226,2.9869,7.8272,1.3044,4.9385,3.4596,8.7988,0.6541,6.101,1.5631,8.6378,15.6313,8.5199,1.4135,4.6335,4.1274,1.2996,1.402,1.9087,2.533,7.7668,1.7737,3.1395,2.711,2.9613,7.5171,4.5279,2.003,5.4648,7.2464,1.685,1.8896,1.0725,3.7722,2.0529,0.9973,0.0731,1.7958,3.1134,2.8055,0.3264,1.6913,6.3876,1.3037,2.9034,0.2877,3.7593,0.1079,2.7574,0.6879,4.9601,3.6173,5.4981,0.742,1.6294,1.86,2.9996,3.5761,1.1683,1.755,0.398,6.8161,1.1366,2.8958,0.5071,1.6711,4.2384,0.999,2.7996,3.9726,1.5751,2.1674,1.6322,3.6849,0.791,1.4606,1.003,1.1514,2.455,4.9479,3.8954,2.9624,2.5699,2.8144,4.4387,2.7463,0.7527,4.7573,1.0518,1.6912,4.8872,0.5933,0.2913,0.0159,6.9007,0.6119,4.7572,1.027,0.2138,1.0954,6.4961,4.293,1.5588,3.6787,0.1481,0.086,0.0952,3.1,4.3406,2.2437,2.1466,1.7919,0.0345,0.0244,0.0053,2.9493,6.6882,0.621,1.3593,2.7931,4.8076,5.0232,2.2771,2.3298,5.9308,7.4137,5.1352,2.812,4.5376,1.6798,0.9307,0.9523,2.8765,2.1331,3.5381,6.8393,0.5116,0.2919,6.4075,0.7248,0.998,3.0219,3.3069,0.0818,1.0501,5.3331,1.0797,7.4448,1.6514,0.2591,0.2286,3.9346,1.42,0.3677,5.64,1.45,6.0238,4.7467,3.4125,4.8815,1.5241,2.1172,2.2375,0.9822,2.423,2.1121,3.4791,3.0872,0.2798,2.2186,3.1681,3.2127,8.4938,6.1948,7.7236,4.3815,5.1973,4.1256,4.6546,3.3601,0.1724,0.0864,0.0184,1.9178,4.699,7.3819,4.144,5.5222,3.2982,1.0618,0.2214,5.1808,4.7591,1.6633,2.8868,0.0756,0.0505,0.0511,3.3096,1.8788,1.4845,1.0776,2.7085,4.7272,6.011,1.7341,2.3029,7.5889,5.542,4.1975,4.0898,4.4214,10.4269,0.8419,11.7929,2.121,2.229,4.2722,1.0215,6.0008,6.4126,2.4507,2.3483,0.8742,1.6475,2.9184,2.0428,4.2589,0.5132,1.7889,0.6591,5.0563,2.0176,0.613,0.0609,3.1178,4.276,3.4869,3.9875,0.9759,0.1545,2.7772,6.381,6.6388,4.5023,6.5494,7.6461,1.0902,0.6676,4.0603,2.3891,1.3156,4.2055,0.0465,0.035,0.0017,4.9414,2.8689,0.2739,3.3428,1.0299,4.9373,3.9431,1.3447,2.896,0.7046,6.6056,0.1544,1.0887,2.3904,6.3026,5.4898,3.1889,1.1395,1.3368,3.3005,1.4875,2.8811,0.34,1.4265,7.5572,4.1218,1.175,1.5161,5.5158,2.179,2.3588,6.5327,0.5657,2.9313,5.514,2.26,3.1831,0.0538,0.0893,0.0028,2.1261,2.1091,0.3242,1.2377,2.2273,3.2061,1.4371,5.9413,0.942,3.2158,6.9378,2.4134,1.648,1.1585,2.2444,3.3717,5.3935,1.0265,2.805,1.3428,3.7872,2.7892,3.5415,6.4098,3.6116,1.8346,0.618,1.9966,4.2135,2.1369,2.5437,0.47,1.8184,2.2922,1.2772,0.418,1.0354,3.3993,6.0124,2.1979,1.1007,5.0727,1.3218,1.0572,6.2372,2.0448,2.5199,2.0731,1.148,3.5431,1.1194,1.8612,2.065,1.7668,1.7028,0.2264,2.015,0.5849,6.9785,0.6492,1.405,4.3179,6.0039,0.9665,1.0361,2.1017,1.1953,5.1155,2.567,2.3116,0.2036,3.5027,3.7912,1.7262,8.7449,1.2598,4.0639,1.0361,2.0194,4.4178,2.668,1.05,5.4681,3.3756,3.5163,5.01,3.2805,2.3092,8.7404,2.301,1.5075,2.591,3.7211,3.2754,1.8333,5.4864,0.0806,0.0611,0.002,5.5554,6.7089,0.7996,3.84,0.6661,1.4544,6.7319,0.4264,3.1157,1.2873,0.8291,3.0454,2.2846,4.5659,0.0241,1.891,2.7233,1.408,1.9928,6.2444,1.285,0.8849,0.6149,2.1382,4.3517,0.0328,0.1078,3.2201,0.7458,4.5418,5.4193,1.1325,2.0565]}
{"prompt":"Write a story about the value of a single human life .","text":"Write a story about the value of a single human life. Write about our value in comparison to a single life (or several lives). If we take the risk, then we are risking our lives. Write about making a difference to the lives of others. This has been done through many activities over the years, for example volunteering for cancer charities. Volunteering in areas such as this has allowed me to get to know those living in poverty and become involved in a way that has made this an integral part of the way in which I live my life. I have had some personal trials, for example I suffered through a serious back injury in my twenties that made me spend two years in hospital, however I have been able to use this experience as an extra incentive to continue volunteering.\nA sense of compassion and empathy is also part of the essential requirements for people in leadership positions. The fact that I have been asked to work in this way is testament to my sense of compassion and empathy, which have made me the ideal candidate to be in this role. Whilst this is not a charity as such, I do have to work with and manage a number of people under my direct authority, whilst also managing the charity itself. I have also had experience working in a public sector environment, with contracts such as those for the delivery of services to schools, in which the key requirement is to be highly organised, professional and efficient. I am also required to be able to communicate and interact with a wide range of people and colleagues, including those in senior and middle management roles. I also have personal experience of the challenges of running a small business, as have my sister and mother, and my grandfather. The knowledge and experience that I have gained through all these activities has added an even greater understanding of the skills and qualities that are required of leaders to run successful teams and projects. There are also a range of other duties that I have undertaken which include leading change management. As the change plan has been agreed and accepted by the board, I now operate as a project manager with the challenge of bringing the plan to life. I also work as the finance and audit director for the charity.","token_len":433,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.8053,7.1145,0.1336,2.8414,4.2876,5.9499,1.3627,1.4142,3.7111,1.7703,5.1095,5.066,2.2913,6.6205,0.2838,3.1086,2.5779,3.5016,5.4835,2.2104,6.7437,3.2718,0.7808,4.1984,2.0877,4.3807,1.8915,4.8709,2.3767,2.7895,0.8195,2.4915,4.5086,1.5423,1.7696,1.0149,5.2564,0.375,7.199,1.2901,1.4027,2.7277,1.7693,2.1304,0.1371,1.0385,0.4827,4.2567,4.8698,1.7658,2.1449,5.3823,4.0129,6.4597,4.1013,0.3733,0.5571,1.3631,5.2632,0.7866,5.2632,2.271,6.435,4.0551,1.3304,6.8935,0.0043,3.5258,5.5826,2.6015,0.0028,4.5434,2.6807,4.1906,2.2495,0.1036,3.9724,1.9395,0.1758,3.8439,5.2643,1.3196,1.9718,1.6044,6.4796,1.745,0.4368,3.2112,4.2764,0.4274,2.3889,3.262,3.7885,4.4855,4.0391,0.0534,0.0039,3.4735,5.0202,3.596,0.0451,0.3327,1.6083,1.2003,0.0601,0.1342,2.2831,2.0493,3.4068,3.9417,4.3077,7.9174,2.1315,3.9322,0.1548,3.864,6.3135,2.5755,1.3849,4.7774,5.2762,0.2686,2.1816,2.2609,2.9806,2.9428,3.8733,0.8705,5.7133,3.5817,0.8783,0.7084,1.6642,2.219,5.9315,1.4224,1.6183,2.2743,1.0949,0.012,5.0567,1.4812,1.1103,1.8259,1.9686,6.9352,4.0587,0.4132,2.9972,2.3051,1.021,1.5254,6.6399,6.7916,0.0285,5.2787,1.7949,2.7299,1.5593,3.1826,3.7015,0.0095,1.2137,6.4083,7.9055,0.8591,5.7178,2.8088,7.578,1.187,0.7381,2.9134,4.6955,0.1462,1.9023,1.3233,1.6593,4.2846,0.3666,2.9808,2.0859,2.7941,2.6189,2.1699,4.3289,0.0363,1.9619,5.4298,0.008,1.5129,0.5483,0.1934,2.6117,2.0583,4.1031,2.9322,0.7709,2.9199,3.7352,0.6107,1.2428,2.2573,2.8504,2.481,1.0622,0.2594,6.194,2.7876,1.5585,1.4829,1.7771,8.269,5.6086,1.4652,0.2904,0.7459,2.1389,2.4153,3.351,3.6913,1.8223,5.3978,6.4079,2.2903,2.3317,0.0023,1.6642,6.5693,1.0964,3.947,5.7286,1.3629,6.1913,1.6856,3.8269,1.8335,4.4626,3.5895,0.4593,1.7731,1.381,2.0171,1.556,4.6241,1.3149,1.8482,2.0367,5.8706,2.1581,3.8372,1.0857,3.1374,8.0995,3.7985,0.0026,3.0016,2.1296,1.4459,7.9213,0.1361,3.3775,1.3888,3.7714,1.0947,4.0764,2.2163,2.6089,6.9512,6.5328,0.9379,1.4949,1.9639,5.3256,5.6384,1.3931,4.4139,0.4022,4.5916,0.5594,2.0136,1.9043,1.5541,6.2132,0.0853,2.0866,2.3697,0.0149,3.9521,3.017,4.0463,0.3406,3.3516,1.6305,0.2353,0.0009,0.365,2.9463,6.1792,1.2383,2.6286,2.2337,1.9436,4.2297,4.5189,4.4867,0.5334,0.828,0.4906,1.8085,2.6431,0.6525,7.5116,0.5854,2.1031,3.5053,4.5133,1.4315,3.236,0.6158,3.1021,1.3169,0.9836,2.5034,5.4071,3.5578,7.5351,1.2339,4.3602,1.5749,1.7923,2.7369,5.1579,0.972,3.5421,5.9324,1.6199,1.3481,2.029,0.6374,0.3828,0.4009,1.9999,5.1289,1.4122,2.3679,1.2641,5.9971,3.3489,3.4098,0.5088,4.5386,0.2679,1.1722,4.6296,1.1375,5.3309,0.8425,2.0401,1.0452,2.242,3.9319,2.9606,3.912,2.8401,6.3393,2.2643,3.4651,0.3255,4.8085,0.9656,1.8703,2.5843,3.5846,0.0009,1.7625,5.7821,0.9019,0.9868,1.1044,3.482,2.4619,4.0567,6.4686,7.9616,5.4121,5.1112,3.4276,3.3702,7.0212,6.7064,2.6607,1.1127,6.2923,1.9667,5.6405,1.1707,0.5018,2.6092,0.7083,0.7365,3.5993,6.4939,1.5684,0.7908,5.4914,0.288,2.9544,1.5834,7.1377,0.2428,4.7467,1.7042,4.0173,1.5404,2.0945,0.7245,1.7519,2.0424,2.2955,2.0368,3.2712,6.7625,2.3417,5.7545,1.5202,1.7114,1.1288,2.4425,1.6283]}

{"prompt":"The first human spaceship capable of FTL flight reaches deep space and makes the most terrifying discovery in the history of mankind ...","text":"The first human spaceship capable of FTL flight reaches deep space and makes the most terrifying discovery in the history of mankind... The Earth isn\u2019t the center of the universe!\nThe two astronauts that have spent countless hours on the moon and beyond realize they've been tricked by a hostile alien ship, and they have to make a desperate decision to stand and fight for survival.\nThe story of Starship Troopers is actually the story of the human race itself. It's the story of our unending love affair with the stars \u2013 and how the very discovery of the stars might just lead to our ultimate extinction.\" (Stone, 1999, p. 8)\"(Eden, 1998, p. 7)\nAs it turns out though, all these different stories do share the same fundamental structure (in fact, the main characters in each are identical). Each has a protagonist, who in each case experiences some kind of terrible threat and is forced to use the FTL drive to flee the Earth in a spaceship.\nBy all accounts, the two stories (Starship Troopers or the Three Mile Island incident) had a profound impact on the development of the science fiction genre and are among the major influences on later works in space science fiction, especially the works of H. P. Lovecraft and Isaac Asimov. It is claimed by Lovecraft himself that Starship Troopers provided the inspiration for his work. The two were so similar, that many critics, such as Carl Sagan (1987, p. 18) and Tom Shippey (1997, p. 43) say they are \"one and the same story\".\nThe basic structure of the story can be summarized in the following form. An alien space ship, probably in an advanced civilization, has discovered a new space. One of the crew members decides to go on a space journey in order to explore this strange new space. The journey starts on the far side of the new light cone and is continued into the deep space. At some point, either the captain or one of the crew member gets trapped in it, which they are not able to leave or reach an escape pod to escape without a FTL drive.","token_len":434,"entropy":[5.3423,6.8511,9.5516,7.7623,0.0027,11.5557,0.2861,4.943,9.198,6.7959,0.3885,2.8026,5.5329,2.8681,3.6996,8.6545,2.2557,2.0748,1.304,0.4746,0.0016,2.8216,5.0061,3.3269,5.5755,5.9453,14.9704,8.7568,2.3556,2.8135,4.5475,0.0193,0.8488,0.7967,3.814,2.0645,6.3437,6.3697,5.1877,4.4058,3.1529,4.2997,4.299,1.0,2.5558,0.8343,3.1136,2.4294,3.295,7.3129,2.5069,3.0016,2.3057,4.9804,1.5357,1.6887,5.025,0.9314,4.844,2.3101,0.9927,2.0618,3.1648,0.7679,2.9849,1.187,3.7577,2.3262,1.2921,6.6968,4.1834,0.8524,2.3103,2.9961,0.9613,1.0729,1.9912,3.9131,1.4123,9.435,2.115,0.0001,1.5718,6.5537,3.2488,1.6353,0.0243,1.5916,3.4645,1.3017,4.6314,0.8508,1.9247,1.0311,1.892,0.2744,0.0573,3.3358,7.8831,1.7436,5.0576,2.1947,0.1841,1.9137,3.5124,6.3197,1.5577,2.7537,3.2411,5.2045,8.0281,0.2643,1.4096,4.513,4.4514,5.2382,3.1906,0.7423,2.5123,2.8182,2.8952,7.1452,4.4319,10.2336,2.0355,4.3635,1.4986,0.5897,0.0663,4.6003,5.1967,7.3815,5.5923,5.3327,0.827,3.0457,0.4506,0.0977,0.0044,3.6062,0.5028,1.2048,5.0834,4.3881,1.0123,0.0015,7.0144,0.2092,4.8239,3.5277,5.1733,2.6211,4.7644,5.8579,2.0309,0.1397,4.2006,4.3709,4.5652,4.1403,2.1589,0.6112,2.0056,3.7397,2.8107,3.3095,2.6537,3.1803,4.1401,1.8499,3.9803,3.0373,1.6201,6.4038,1.584,2.5064,4.7037,4.5877,1.1685,6.0267,3.7297,1.6522,0.0017,5.7959,6.8763,2.8905,2.5079,2.1394,0.1016,5.3057,2.4281,7.77,0.0076,1.7253,0.5254,5.4867,1.6096,3.4192,3.4307,2.2779,2.4477,1.0384,1.7724,6.0642,4.87,0.3935,0.8313,1.1442,4.1997,2.8233,4.8916,5.7334,0.0218,0.0029,0.0002,6.2929,3.1597,7.6216,5.6621,0.5593,6.8114,0.2304,4.8506,1.4847,4.4391,0.9276,0.067,0.8992,2.5616,0.0819,1.3698,3.8156,0.3028,0.5081,2.4415,4.4382,4.9102,0.1422,4.671,1.5651,0.9091,5.8893,2.8102,2.308,5.8607,2.3483,0.0989,2.5598,3.2531,1.6365,3.9947,0.4772,4.9777,0.0304,1.7646,0.0058,0.0053,0.9842,4.2824,0.0058,0.0,0.2116,4.3253,1.5019,7.9729,2.2367,3.7055,3.1364,0.1685,5.4404,0.001,0.0003,6.4862,1.2373,1.6251,0.1188,2.0658,2.9456,1.8683,3.0311,3.8533,5.9328,4.6315,2.6077,2.1454,1.7425,3.9852,4.4341,3.3977,3.3604,0.0016,6.4222,1.4358,3.1478,6.658,1.5644,0.3644,0.0042,5.0468,0.8226,1.4059,5.5392,5.052,4.0195,5.7352,0.1459,3.0186,0.4299,0.0941,0.0021,5.1359,1.0466,5.4253,2.4197,2.0891,2.7214,3.0534,0.9448,0.0188,0.0001,4.3177,1.3968,0.9089,1.9697,5.7653,2.4219,0.2068,0.7173,0.6768,4.0709,0.2132,3.0971,1.3952,1.5836,0.0918,4.2865,2.4353,5.9051,1.6277,5.7825,1.6977,2.7259,6.7646,4.1282,2.8062,2.7257,6.1318,0.6207,3.1064,4.915,1.2088,3.3177,5.3954,3.6988,4.5592,0.4351,0.3468,1.5008,1.4866,4.7445,0.1773,2.8706,1.605,0.4089,5.3946,3.2821,3.6116,1.139,0.0062,3.6792,3.0309,5.1789,0.8369,1.2791,0.7372,1.301,5.004,3.2674,3.1079,1.4071,4.6542,0.233,0.1139,0.375,5.12,9.4978,5.6342,2.4537,2.9203,4.908,5.0347,0.4915,3.9853,1.9089,1.6813,3.565,2.1024,0.0577,0.8916,7.1476,0.9404,3.166,0.8634,4.7226,0.0351,0.1093,0.9975,3.1192,3.9751,3.4518,0.8951,4.5238,1.8128,2.7833,3.9816,3.0042,3.8453,1.3584,0.0012,4.4551,4.1335,5.2054,8.0316,1.842,1.5183,3.5028,1.2787,5.4523,3.8532,9.9606,0.0018,0.3215,0.3656]}

But he was no coward, and it was a man who could stand up to anyone he was capable of dealing a blow. But even he had found a weakness.\n'' We are going back into the room to get something straight.

And now you can see the face of the person you're missing every day.' 'When you' ve left this world. And so it goes,'' And you' re not going back there,'' This is home,'' This is home where I belong,'' This is home now.' And he gets a little choked up, because he wants to be here. And they are trying to get him to leave so we can get on with the show. So I think there' s plenty of hope in this show, as a message of support from our families to their loved ones. It' s all part of the process but he' s not going anywhere, right? Not like that. But like in the final moments of this show that he' s there, looking at himself in the mirror, but not there, just there. With a great big hole in his heart, a big hole from where he was coming before you' re with him no longer. And that' s very hard for him to accept. And it' s hard for everyone to accept, but then he had this really good laugh with them too. And it was like he' s really got everything together again in those last moments of the first episode. And that' s a wonderful, wonderful message to me because that' s what it is, that' s what it is. It' s a battle with your own illness. If it' s there, take it on and get on with it. Don' t let it take away your life. And we can all be there for you, and we can always be there for you. Now, in a moment. So I want to just say thanks to everyone who' s been there. We' re all in this together, and we' re not alone any more, the people we love are in this together, and you must remember this. There' s a lot of people who are thinking about you. And you' re always in my thoughts. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.","token_len":435,"entropy":[2.4913,4.4212,0.0079,3.3715,5.5746,1.5027,8.6154,3.2933,7.0699,2.8335,2.1617,0.014,6.0721,3.5738,7.0188,0.666,4.8864,0.8932,4.3027,5.5057,0.5783,3.5652,0.1688,4.16,4.6874,5.1413,3.9243,1.1997,2.6918,1.9719,6.6315,0.1663,2.0574,2.8962,3.1351,3.0582,4.6845,6.261,1.0594,8.3032,6.5042,4.7158,1.5628,10.1916,7.7012,3.8926,3.8649,1.6685,3.7723,2.8987,4.5684,2.8553,3.4359,8.9794,8.3032,5.3914,5.6962,4.971,4.6192,2.9909,2.3268,3.4744,5.3219,5.8901,1.1625,8.8164,4.7646,3.5782,0.1509,1.1376,5.997,1.668,6.3251,2.7219,1.8445,0.0572,0.4527,5.782,5.6386,2.4978,3.6378,6.1529,3.0144,2.7109,5.9489,0.1785,2.3186,4.074,0.9839,3.6614,0.3475,3.0401,3.5269,1.5662,1.1712,4.4009,3.6455,4.0765,0.1372,2.2274,0.9903,0.8704,2.8116,4.3639,3.9245,0.3324,2.1901,4.0951,1.7318,1.8881,5.2765,0.8818,2.5251,2.2614,3.6487,3.8871,3.9852,0.7991,7.0808,0.1906,4.2582,3.3474,2.0551,2.6368,1.827,4.2001,3.7041,7.1376,2.557,3.461,3.3976,3.6169,5.4605,2.9332,4.1751,1.9791,0.0409,0.9811,3.0886,2.8849,0.0703,3.695,3.6679,0.0365,1.0867,3.7937,5.8761,4.563,2.8612,0.5764,2.6016,1.5826,3.5413,2.3368,4.9594,0.4863,5.6886,4.841,1.6365,0.5706,3.1405,5.4642,4.7977,1.4041,5.472,3.7129,0.8833,2.4479,1.2278,4.6054,2.3995,2.225,0.2167,5.3175,1.6123,6.8566,1.669,4.3582,1.7447,0.8053,0.0361,1.4258,4.5326,3.1197,5.7153,1.9327,4.0727,3.91,0.7379,6.6227,2.835,4.5509,5.0162,7.3944,0.5877,0.3035,1.9426,1.5739,4.1975,1.8361,0.9234,6.4892,3.0305,0.4845,2.2588,4.8003,5.8306,4.5087,6.2798,3.5253,6.0163,2.4704,7.1455,1.7708,1.6616,1.5288,2.7837,2.7255,0.0522,4.9098,3.6766,1.833,0.5433,0.9341,2.7373,0.7289,1.4334,2.4852,1.5969,0.0281,1.7799,0.4646,4.6262,1.2188,0.7432,2.1643,2.3301,4.8206,1.6551,5.9694,2.6244,4.2828,2.2877,5.4868,3.5463,3.9267,6.2971,0.6471,1.1452,2.3739,1.843,2.8996,2.1908,1.9256,0.295,3.5429,5.2225,6.0168,2.2611,4.6864,4.0793,5.1919,1.1433,0.8621,1.8708,1.6279,5.1564,1.8631,0.7792,1.2303,2.5623,1.7919,0.0244,2.328,4.0376,3.1342,1.8822,4.4602,2.0771,4.1353,4.0455,3.23,1.6315,0.0118,1.9618,2.4925,2.3147,1.8656,2.1116,1.4447,0.0169,0.8501,0.9026,0.8373,1.075,2.0864,1.2243,0.0337,1.9612,8.4857,3.0926,4.55,2.7386,4.2565,1.1078,5.0664,2.5341,1.0048,0.0245,5.1546,0.8729,7.3516,0.8634,4.3781,2.3004,3.5577,1.6953,0.0955,0.5521,0.5115,4.377,1.5701,0.1018,3.1016,1.0104,3.5922,3.4357,2.475,2.0413,0.5963,2.1162,4.0538,2.9222,2.4961,2.9329,3.024,0.8059,1.0552,1.8942,2.3371,1.5494,0.4316,5.2737,0.9963,0.5582,0.2599,0.1949,0.7665,5.8462,1.8057,4.539,2.7654,3.7252,3.6625,3.4631,2.284,3.0344,0.344,4.4114,1.3498,4.1007,0.7092,2.0931,0.7688,4.9966,0.1933,1.7371,3.0014,2.1022,2.9707,1.9688,2.9804,2.7121,3.8424,1.9684,1.0277,1.6484,1.2208,1.1981,1.4804,0.8512,4.417,3.8997,5.4702,0.4743,1.5265,5.739,2.3597,2.8356,1.4756,3.2265,2.9003,0.7287,0.2647,1.6634,0.8072,3.9535,6.4667,4.0828,2.9416,1.2997,4.2859,1.8758,0.0666,1.7665,1.1321,0.3823,1.4018,2.001,1.5705,6.9247,0.8702,2.46,1.5998,1.3817,2.2156,1.3566,1.7026,4.5829,3.4604,4.2282,1.7966,1.3132,4.0921,0.036,1.3839,2.779,0.0255,0.7778,1.9784,0.0187,3.9521,0.0336,0.4173]}
{"prompt":"You are the protagonist in a Horror story , but the thing is : You do n't give a fuck .","text":"You are the protagonist in a Horror story, but the thing is : You don't give a fuck. I thought I read a short story, not a novel.\nYou are the protagonist in a Horror story, but the thing is : You don't give a fuck. I thought I read a short story, not a novel.\nI wish I could say it was a very different book, but it was very similar. This is actually my first foray into Raina Telgemeier and boy am I glad I read it. I thought the story of the book was really original, the way it weaves together the characters and how the setting plays a large role in the story. The characters were really great, I loved how quirky and different some were. I really like when things get silly, I loved that every chapter started off with a question. I also really liked the different voices in the book. I thought there was a lot of humor mixed up in the book, things just seem to go a little too far sometimes, like the dad, but it was fun. This is my first ever book by this author and it won't be the last. I have to say I am very pleased with this one!!!!\nI feel that Raina Telgemeier does a great job of keeping her readers intrigued and guessing things about the characters. In this story she creates a fun atmosphere that combines both a supernatural horror and a classic story of boy meets girl. One of Raina Telgemeier's best stories...and a great choice for fans of The Dark Tower series!\nI read this because I wanted to check out Raina Telgemeier. I enjoyed it! I didn't like it as much as The Dark Tower, but I thought it was okay. I still enjoyed it a lot and the ending was a bit confusing. I'm not sure where Raina Telgemeier is going with this story, but I definitely didn't mind. I did like the characters, especially the main character, which has a lot to do with her good story telling. And I liked her voice! I hope she writes more of this.","token_len":435,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,7.0031,3.0225,2.115,10.9424,3.0838,1.6729,2.9459,3.1282,5.9165,1.4515,8.5284,3.1759,2.8064,0.0029,5.8666,1.211,1.7467,1.7822,3.439,5.2095,2.1521,4.7502,2.2222,5.4933,0.5178,2.5193,5.0815,1.2695,2.6398,0.9258,2.5955,6.4606,1.7535,1.2985,0.2365,0.1057,0.1078,0.7688,0.0094,0.0191,0.02,0.0022,0.0028,0.0016,0.1695,0.1113,0.0776,0.0004,0.0123,0.0007,0.021,0.0021,0.3178,0.0095,0.0033,0.0019,0.0016,0.0042,0.0014,0.0012,0.0047,0.0013,0.0057,0.0007,1.9195,2.5651,5.5653,0.9213,0.8859,2.0522,3.3024,1.496,1.5851,4.2393,3.641,2.7112,1.355,0.6778,1.7075,1.287,3.8803,3.1957,1.2985,4.4691,1.2544,5.1996,2.7574,1.1231,4.4329,0.0296,11.9246,4.3715,10.1507,3.7754,1.713,0.0243,3.2772,10.3428,3.0965,0.0267,0.762,0.5044,4.1967,0.326,0.3281,1.6473,4.5478,2.6296,1.9429,5.001,1.7744,4.0672,0.4129,3.4146,6.5197,1.1056,3.5636,3.4457,0.8959,9.5059,0.7351,1.7379,1.4586,2.7461,1.3669,3.8718,2.2747,4.3701,4.0502,2.8384,3.8087,1.0694,0.5926,0.8947,0.9343,0.5431,2.2074,2.9206,3.1164,3.8684,4.3182,1.1747,3.1528,2.7808,2.538,9.9124,1.4603,3.8077,5.2387,4.0067,1.0242,1.5442,3.1613,2.4917,4.9904,4.3704,2.4386,5.2301,1.4969,2.9476,5.7384,2.0599,6.2526,4.624,4.8978,1.9975,1.3796,0.9747,4.1497,1.8424,1.687,3.2897,2.5011,0.9456,1.1291,5.6348,5.0712,2.4069,0.4539,1.6634,0.9033,1.402,3.4776,3.5245,0.5897,0.9032,0.6616,0.5235,3.3159,6.4686,3.2476,0.797,0.7994,2.3644,0.9527,6.3934,4.6111,4.9785,1.1401,1.9965,4.2014,0.7851,1.6308,1.2328,4.4261,2.2889,3.0705,2.1858,8.359,4.1694,4.5425,2.479,1.5909,2.7537,1.4263,4.4875,0.9286,2.1347,0.3749,4.9617,2.2789,4.7215,4.1599,1.2875,1.5151,2.084,6.8274,0.3176,0.636,0.861,0.0518,0.7145,1.7921,3.4188,2.2965,0.5308,1.4863,2.0832,1.7619,1.9494,0.2722,2.1587,2.6116,8.5582,1.439,1.1591,5.4314,3.0088,2.171,0.0041,0.4222,0.0004,0.0004,0.0002,5.4881,0.6846,1.5138,0.0125,1.0574,3.7761,4.211,3.3202,4.8632,1.4155,6.9926,5.1851,2.6424,0.6967,1.7132,0.9579,4.3608,2.3266,3.2274,2.3445,5.7066,0.8154,5.8272,3.6561,2.1546,6.2908,3.8658,3.7481,5.7423,3.0498,1.0997,0.629,5.1035,3.0293,3.9203,8.0394,2.5573,0.2983,0.5827,5.1427,0.9528,5.7618,0.0088,2.1637,0.0001,0.0011,0.0005,0.0335,1.7099,3.0863,7.2476,3.5696,3.0619,2.3916,5.3719,0.5891,5.1066,0.1648,4.4646,4.1806,1.2646,2.339,2.9618,0.812,1.6712,3.4935,1.848,5.0203,0.4444,2.2351,0.1857,4.3946,0.2521,3.4626,0.0081,0.3441,0.0001,0.0009,0.0005,2.2344,0.9237,4.8459,2.0559,5.2728,1.1358,4.0027,0.0013,2.5696,2.2872,2.5677,0.1512,0.2054,5.7162,1.2092,0.0028,1.3281,0.4894,0.899,3.5867,0.5224,0.3866,6.4322,0.973,1.0874,5.3017,3.1522,1.2797,3.4256,0.3069,2.3847,4.2324,3.6831,0.9565,2.1676,1.7552,3.7248,0.9334,0.9193,3.2242,1.7647,0.6929,4.3096,2.7677,0.0048,0.6227,0.0001,0.0012,0.0011,2.4441,0.9758,0.9429,0.8471,2.2716,0.8757,0.3712,0.7758,4.4484,4.9177,0.0007,3.9062,1.9126,1.2283,4.1467,1.2204,1.0823,3.9253,1.3684,3.9045,0.8141,4.0469,1.0935,1.0949,4.3905,5.3354,1.6689,1.0501,0.8029,0.1047,0.002,1.5049,6.8561,4.8529,3.2447,0.8943,4.5261,1.6429,2.3798,2.5599,3.4406,3.6314,1.1235,4.5136,2.0935,5.4386,1.5845,2.5092,2.4902,3.4239]}

I pour about 1 tsp into my palm, rub my palms together, add a bit of water to my palm and start massaging my scalp gently. I will not stop and rinse it. I will wait for it to foam for about 5 minutes. I rub the foam into my scalp, which is a bit more pressure than I would normally use. I then rinse my hair.\nAll the items are good as described.

{"prompt":"You 're a gingerbread man , who has just tasted your own own flesh . You 're now fighting off the temptation to eat yourself .","text":"You're a gingerbread man, who has just tasted your own own flesh. You're now fighting off the temptation to eat yourself. Do you know what's on your mind? Well.. your head is filled with gingerbread. It's like a dream. You have the best possible job of any other man in the world : you eat gingerbread whenever you want!\nMorning, afternoon, evenings, all hours of the night! What does this mean, you say? Well... you see, when you're out shopping, buying stuff to eat, they give you some, but you don't like what you get because it's only the tinned stuff. So, when you come home at night, you can never take yourself out for a treat. But when you start eating things out, you won't go for that, because you think of it as taking advantage of them. They only give you good things once in a while.\nWhy does this have to end, you ask? Because you deserve better things. Your time is short, and when you spend it so unhealthily, you lose your youth. This is what gingerbread makes impossible. This is what I said when I was on the cover of an American magazine. I said that you lose your youth eating gingerbread and drink cola, and driving a car, which is my opinion, is the first thing you should cut out of your life.\nYou see, you eat gingerbread, you wear tight clothes, you dress badly. This makes no difference to me, but it certainly affects your friends, other people, because their eyes go straight in your direction. People you don't know begin to look at you, because they think... and I can see exactly what they think of you. This is why they think, in their minds, of you as a boy with a big dick. They can see it. When I saw them looking at me like that, this is what I said to them:\nI could understand, but then I didn 't say anything. Because after all, you see, I had this job - and no, I didn't have a big dick.","token_len":437,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,9.5189,2.1898,1.5295,1.3575,5.3799,2.7834,3.9888,6.9578,4.3878,5.2264,8.4295,6.716,1.2918,2.0979,1.3679,5.6807,7.2669,4.192,1.4853,6.4751,0.4904,2.6904,4.1357,1.6483,4.6505,0.2301,2.4069,1.2032,3.1971,4.2992,0.4468,0.4874,0.7967,5.3345,6.595,4.9312,4.9402,0.9421,4.7649,0.0403,7.8149,0.1951,1.3614,2.6734,0.4971,3.1695,1.7247,4.9233,1.0371,1.7238,3.4541,3.7563,4.9039,5.4607,5.4018,3.2534,3.0142,5.7034,1.9097,1.2529,0.4205,0.3915,9.5887,4.1258,4.4754,1.9886,0.0208,6.1244,0.2128,0.5431,4.2013,2.765,12.2482,1.801,4.4767,0.4512,5.1288,0.7912,3.9983,6.4649,0.9382,0.1024,2.9671,2.9439,4.5614,3.8719,1.6936,0.8553,3.3683,3.0243,2.7845,0.4603,2.6531,3.4078,2.226,5.0123,0.7013,3.6296,0.7835,1.4782,4.7782,4.7161,0.8484,7.4165,3.423,5.6534,1.3993,0.4336,6.3481,4.1469,0.1265,3.5989,4.9819,2.3551,1.7097,1.3107,0.0007,3.1704,3.6055,0.8995,1.5073,3.9226,1.5107,0.3874,4.2002,3.496,6.6083,2.2208,1.6533,0.9375,1.8041,1.5107,2.5371,0.243,3.2823,0.3734,4.4275,0.5319,0.5361,0.6382,3.7472,5.477,4.1507,6.1011,2.1336,2.6623,0.7019,5.1165,0.7912,2.9451,1.838,0.15,5.684,2.841,4.7072,4.6621,1.1567,0.7485,4.7532,0.0009,4.3278,4.1038,3.1848,2.6246,1.6004,0.8959,4.0184,4.0457,1.6572,0.269,6.0173,4.4715,0.0217,4.8452,0.5939,4.885,4.8583,1.9533,0.055,5.428,1.5794,6.7851,2.1766,0.2417,0.131,0.8502,2.2695,4.5723,2.6122,1.1823,3.686,0.45,5.5619,2.7604,1.6272,0.1549,0.3766,0.9183,1.2016,7.7869,2.3795,1.9675,1.1638,4.1795,6.4191,1.119,3.9785,0.9406,1.4083,3.737,0.2029,4.7964,0.6696,6.9594,6.6216,4.5911,0.0346,0.258,0.6769,3.1769,1.6042,7.9983,0.6467,4.5108,0.7897,2.495,6.4444,0.0269,4.7754,10.6513,0.7601,4.6064,0.2032,0.811,4.07,4.7759,3.0047,0.1468,3.256,5.485,1.3324,5.4212,0.0747,5.2749,2.442,1.2947,1.1932,1.9999,1.2571,1.3466,2.4414,6.0505,0.4128,0.9327,10.6065,2.0544,0.0297,3.4786,7.0476,8.1626,0.0735,1.7435,1.2425,10.0668,2.0399,1.3106,1.813,4.8178,1.0058,5.7784,5.2321,1.398,2.6827,2.665,4.8702,0.8357,1.0234,2.0059,6.8419,1.4847,0.6374,0.1848,0.6242,0.4423,1.4305,2.6706,3.1127,0.201,2.882,4.5182,0.9669,0.0088,2.7112,2.4052,5.4048,8.9684,1.4948,0.3687,0.7127,4.5788,4.7087,1.5209,3.9643,3.16,3.8117,1.2783,1.0236,3.4186,1.259,2.2739,1.8868,5.5909,4.3747,1.7133,6.0577,1.5545,6.5277,0.4894,0.8253,5.4969,5.0644,4.9687,4.9318,3.4558,4.8758,0.9987,2.4559,0.6287,5.0725,4.4804,2.1287,0.0007,0.8604,8.0134,0.2147,2.7915,0.702,0.225,2.703,3.6218,0.9089,2.1413,6.9445,4.2079,4.7645,3.4602,2.1301,6.278,0.6008,1.1141,2.4275,3.4242,0.1394,0.5817,3.9728,0.7058,1.7282,3.3071,2.9506,3.4594,4.2228,2.8252,1.4569,0.271,1.7194,0.6161,2.7046,1.0474,4.7312,4.3224,1.1915,3.2035,5.0844,0.7103,2.44,4.4209,1.4609,3.4622,2.4406,4.7445,2.0235,3.7067,3.1855,4.1433,0.1008,0.2332,3.8648,0.2302,0.1897,6.2897,1.6195,1.1644,1.1872,1.5854,1.4818,0.7642,2.0162,1.4978,2.7706,4.9406,6.1138,3.9765,2.0893,5.135,0.9967,3.7855,10.5527,2.1129,6.0274,1.8955,0.8767,4.3912,5.4648,1.2031,0.2214,2.3267,4.034,0.8113,1.513,3.7085,4.0782,6.2241,5.4535,2.4499,5.1036,1.886,0.4304,0.9081,0.0184,3.0857,1.4031,3.9925,0.3614,0.7236]}

{"prompt":"You run a shop for adventurers in a fantasy town . New adventurers keep selling you gear that you sold to other adventurers a long time ago .","text":"You run a shop for adventurers in a fantasy town. New adventurers keep selling you gear that you sold to other adventurers a long time ago. Your shop has a few inventory columns but you can't see what the current list of adventurers has. As of the moment there are only 3 adventurers in the town and you've been the only one to sell those gear. A new adventurer comes into your shop and buys the exact same gear that the 3 Adventurers had bought.\nWhat am I suppose to do with the 3 inventory items now. Should I change them to the first adventurer.\nIf you wish, you could just delete the items that your shop is now selling to the new adventurer, and the system should do the rest of the trick.\nWhen you are talking with a client, is it possible to set the conversation to private so that the client is not able to message others in the room? I am looking for a way to protect a meeting from an attacker.\nI have looked through the settings for webex and am unable to find a setting for this function. I have seen it before in other conferencing services and thought this would be available for webex but it appears to be removed.\nYes you can customize these in webex by following the steps in this article:\nThis is one of the features that was removed from the webex client in their 2017 update. I used to use this feature in our team meetings (several people using the webex client) and it has really let me cut down on unwanted conversation, and also has let me avoid some of the issues where someone may feel uncomfortable using the microphone as they don't like or want to be heard outside of a specific group of people.\nI agree. This feature is great for protecting private meetings from people that aren't invited to the meeting.\nBut how would they know? The person I was trying to protect my conference from isn't on the meeting\/conference. Only attendees have this power.\nI would say that if a user is not attendee, and they have a way to send a message to all participants, I doubt they wouldn't know about the conference.","token_len":437,"entropy":[7.2748,2.2777,6.0716,3.829,7.565,3.3108,2.8213,7.8063,3.9597,1.8959,8.334,3.2822,8.524,5.1011,3.2205,4.8544,3.2674,1.6551,7.2802,1.4575,2.7592,0.4864,6.5436,1.8911,0.0206,0.0125,0.5055,3.8661,3.0743,3.1357,1.5063,4.1167,7.033,8.5979,4.3592,2.026,1.2015,0.9083,4.0439,2.358,3.3197,5.0799,6.0384,1.4745,3.3113,3.4796,0.8382,4.7973,3.3352,2.6739,4.7862,3.61,0.8175,2.1507,3.1469,1.9412,1.3818,0.7747,2.5203,1.9151,1.7559,4.4797,2.9208,5.903,1.1004,0.0859,1.3923,0.7547,4.9577,4.1782,0.7728,4.9012,2.5535,0.8542,3.0482,2.9608,0.8619,0.0981,0.8903,3.4107,2.1183,5.8888,0.3611,0.6321,2.623,3.1465,6.7895,9.1546,0.1167,2.7962,2.5401,1.1883,2.5092,8.1593,5.6527,0.0171,7.8515,0.2055,0.5142,1.4132,1.9577,5.3764,7.3389,3.8481,4.2584,4.5581,4.7979,0.5524,4.1287,1.3883,1.6347,3.1417,5.1556,4.4138,5.2027,1.6173,3.53,1.1973,4.725,2.4384,0.5702,2.1254,3.2166,4.2502,0.8298,2.7148,2.6009,4.3259,1.8709,3.7041,3.365,1.0216,3.0004,1.5055,2.5024,0.6795,2.6468,1.855,3.0771,7.677,3.5273,4.5891,0.6351,1.0805,3.2232,0.2202,5.9655,0.3675,0.8158,4.8081,1.2304,3.1846,6.1064,2.6457,1.5124,6.4081,0.8996,7.8944,1.2512,1.1644,0.2598,4.521,1.6218,6.6567,1.3844,6.0635,3.5952,0.7392,1.6578,1.6796,3.6448,1.1852,1.9993,0.0036,6.2851,6.4497,3.7981,0.6929,2.9071,0.5836,3.5154,3.3349,4.6312,2.1067,1.6634,0.955,0.198,5.2831,4.0504,8.0569,2.3026,4.6194,2.7755,1.1776,0.8928,2.1753,2.1765,5.0487,3.8044,1.1699,4.8973,1.8188,8.1969,8.187,2.1743,4.1893,3.9123,0.0071,0.3255,1.5376,4.4679,1.9126,2.6319,5.8474,0.3451,1.9134,2.1944,4.1678,3.3107,4.9248,1.6266,3.7634,10.1777,0.5932,0.1053,2.8976,2.0512,4.575,2.8719,1.3521,0.211,8.0922,2.2884,4.8644,0.0727,2.9825,1.8545,4.2489,1.4735,0.3669,6.3328,1.2173,0.9788,6.9274,3.9551,0.5217,6.6185,4.8009,5.743,2.4805,0.0128,3.3147,4.4702,0.6203,2.2093,1.7933,1.8288,2.4402,3.1777,0.9052,6.1142,1.5019,4.3472,0.4203,0.4438,3.6972,0.7958,3.88,2.0084,1.003,1.0518,1.8997,0.0838,3.3408,2.5817,6.3538,9.1528,1.3435,0.5016,2.795,5.6627,1.5312,1.3897,1.8399,0.7215,2.0256,4.5724,6.9967,4.9172,4.8358,7.6315,0.0308,3.6503,5.8818,1.8868,2.0381,0.0156,1.0913,2.0709,1.4079,1.6312,2.7017,5.3763,6.0437,0.7461,7.2331,1.3045,0.3232,6.5584,4.8008,3.8885,2.7992,3.7123,3.7635,4.8955,0.1358,3.0753,4.0773,1.2819,0.1134,3.4717,4.7167,4.2593,3.4274,5.0761,2.8792,3.5022,1.1928,6.3131,4.9268,2.0461,4.1889,0.0013,3.2842,5.1171,2.1315,0.2536,2.149,1.1725,7.1612,0.7403,1.9388,4.7737,2.2976,1.9367,0.2032,0.2494,1.1462,1.9854,6.4862,4.397,3.1862,0.9232,1.222,3.6204,1.5658,5.7916,4.7171,1.8936,1.9374,3.3341,2.5765,4.2298,0.0009,5.5355,1.1111,1.8084,0.9537,0.6616,1.5496,4.0421,3.5549,3.7224,5.2187,1.2364,2.8673,3.3035,4.4751,5.2412,2.1691,3.8804,0.0067,1.3629,5.9225,6.0347,1.5495,4.8376,0.0008,4.4131,0.8281,3.0129,7.8859,2.7979,3.8513,7.0582,7.4596,3.6318,4.6731,5.4313,0.9529,1.261,2.179,3.0375,4.0294,1.0385,2.1238,2.709,3.5406,1.8577,2.7628,11.808,2.3639,1.2572,2.8753,2.0145,2.754,1.9884,5.0472,0.2283,4.1198,1.7403,0.4387,0.7246,4.7726,4.3336,1.0782,4.2297,6.1987,1.2011,6.0053,0.0005,2.4449,2.2978,1.8936,5.6682,1.547]}
{"prompt":"Technology has been abstracted so far that the common person knows nothing about how things work . You are tech support .","text":"Technology has been abstracted so far that the common person knows nothing about how things work. You are tech support. It should be at least possible for anyone within an organization that is looking into technology to be able to have an idea of what is going on and what can be done. The person trying to fix may not know the language the program uses, but he should be able to understand the basic logic of the program without having to spend time learning the programming language. This is similar to the way how the mechanic can understand the car and even talk some to the person trying to fix it. The mechanic may not be able to say what the issue is, but he is more often than not able to fix it. In fact, if the problem can be diagnosed at all, then its much easier to fix.\nWhat should be done to help prevent this from happening? What needs to be done differently? I would suggest some changes to the way technologies are used. Instead of using technology as the mechanism that provides information, it is better to try to use technology as the mechanism that provides interaction. Use the technology as we use the human body. It is not just the end product that is important, but how it is used. In the end we are the product of the technology we use. If we don't understand the technology on our side, then how can we possibly expect the client to understand the use you are trying to do? What we should focus on are technologies that allow people to communicate. The way people communicate has to change. The old communication styles don't allow us to express ourselves in a way that will translate into interaction with technology. It is not about sending technology to people. The people must have a place at the table where their voice can be heard.\nTo bring this idea to life, we would need a completely different way of looking at things. Instead of thinking how to use technology, we should think how to use people and what their capabilities are. We want people to do something but we don't want to give them the power to do it. As technology and systems move away from having power to people, so will the success that is achieved.","token_len":438,"entropy":[5.3745,2.0637,12.2486,0.0775,4.7445,3.2205,4.4321,2.3899,7.6568,6.2828,4.9144,2.5686,0.5246,3.53,4.1448,0.4488,0.8715,4.3853,3.393,10.8219,6.3982,1.7598,3.4659,5.3452,0.4619,6.1986,1.2509,4.589,2.0542,3.925,5.9084,4.0331,0.4283,3.5743,2.0669,4.3636,3.8962,4.6999,0.6499,2.9422,1.3733,0.0092,5.1183,2.1848,2.6487,0.9752,0.9139,2.2378,0.7599,0.084,2.1988,1.9139,3.8609,0.2139,0.1059,1.3718,3.0606,4.9131,5.397,0.0377,5.0405,10.4878,1.3167,1.1101,2.3313,4.7626,5.5501,4.7499,2.3578,1.0739,1.2876,3.2542,4.1099,1.1969,0.0982,0.0098,2.0377,1.5871,4.2169,5.124,0.8714,1.0128,1.1613,4.1377,1.3961,0.0901,3.9774,1.7806,3.3134,2.1616,2.748,0.4858,0.5303,3.1105,1.0532,6.2247,0.0317,1.5464,1.776,7.2255,2.7633,8.7977,3.7336,3.6635,1.5283,4.6712,2.7412,5.2866,5.4174,7.5833,7.1789,2.1165,4.3946,2.9704,0.0143,0.9062,0.5501,0.292,2.5132,4.0862,2.6332,1.3891,1.9681,0.6303,0.0146,5.1611,2.1065,1.462,6.3473,0.1039,1.0107,0.4422,0.7598,2.3258,4.5265,6.6897,1.8311,0.0007,0.7218,0.0041,4.3892,0.8137,0.6335,3.7668,2.5202,0.2693,2.4999,1.3699,4.8857,4.4083,0.2375,6.2825,3.8168,1.8468,0.5118,2.2811,6.1431,4.3677,0.7123,0.436,1.652,1.8756,1.5365,7.9742,4.6616,1.7904,0.832,2.1142,2.3743,4.514,1.6991,1.6682,0.071,0.5372,4.7779,4.6904,0.0655,0.1602,0.0655,6.6681,1.1066,3.6424,2.8315,1.7841,4.4918,4.4516,0.9917,1.1848,1.7804,6.4127,0.6372,1.4533,1.3241,5.0139,0.0217,2.2109,3.6176,2.1083,3.3687,5.0678,2.4973,4.8919,2.5829,1.05,2.5976,2.1367,1.5005,0.1669,4.7583,0.5017,1.7276,1.1054,0.3125,1.044,1.0767,0.3494,1.1095,6.2078,0.7722,5.8333,2.3419,3.1969,1.0786,6.6103,4.0751,2.8634,3.6919,2.5819,0.9001,3.081,0.8937,2.2849,2.6214,1.9522,7.5443,1.2563,2.0856,1.2608,3.3369,1.0968,0.6387,2.7951,1.1866,0.9168,0.4127,0.7517,3.8966,1.8548,2.3097,3.5934,2.4836,3.979,3.3049,1.7117,1.8209,3.8206,2.5111,0.2249,0.5745,2.8898,1.039,2.6012,0.0011,3.3772,1.2476,1.5765,6.2996,2.8519,4.9762,0.5734,1.0434,3.9312,1.0535,0.0864,4.2988,5.7644,2.09,7.3677,0.136,2.0494,1.3415,5.4148,6.4007,0.9687,2.8401,0.0097,3.9024,0.7276,3.6527,2.8208,1.9778,4.1998,0.173,3.9162,5.8823,0.2086,3.1774,2.634,0.1055,2.7373,2.3242,2.8927,3.6089,3.8125,0.899,4.0935,2.2292,3.9288,1.0607,2.5086,5.471,5.1869,5.9516,5.4442,0.0008,2.2054,2.9009,0.0517,5.0281,2.389,1.7451,1.4363,0.9178,0.1607,3.8461,6.261,1.1579,5.8506,2.813,4.3661,0.1874,3.0289,0.7689,2.4226,3.4604,5.7121,6.1104,1.6656,1.9264,1.8478,2.6878,4.2985,6.5466,2.9838,1.6635,4.1705,5.0433,0.8383,0.1972,2.7823,4.7285,4.6976,0.803,0.1168,0.1348,0.4992,2.6875,4.9616,5.5671,2.223,3.3306,0.8876,2.3044,0.445,2.045,3.9856,1.609,2.7522,5.8896,1.6566,1.8229,0.4006,4.2333,0.0142,3.0193,0.2881,3.4219,0.0282,3.3824,5.9765,2.8067,2.2641,0.3317,1.4475,0.7197,0.907,0.8657,1.3988,0.305,0.4933,4.5897,3.6355,2.8402,4.1101,4.6426,0.376,0.2455,2.121,4.4034,1.1985,0.1408,5.0741,2.7052,5.8952,2.0134,1.6873,0.0009,0.1388,1.6094,3.2782,0.329,1.6494,2.3344,0.3079,0.5667,0.7931,0.707,4.5329,2.0975,5.0489,5.7007,5.126,2.8151,0.0124,4.5392,4.357,1.6083,5.283,0.4119,2.8845,1.986,1.4951,8.1625,4.6121,3.6919,1.9698,0.7257]}

You can recall the entire story with everything that used to be but now things are completely different.","token_len":438,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,1.8557,10.2088,6.1527,0.0704,9.6447,6.549,2.2949,4.9993,1.1484,8.5214,2.7205,1.4836,0.9293,3.2962,4.9688,1.8186,3.5505,1.3912,8.1418,3.3938,1.0279,3.3222,3.8463,7.141,7.1472,1.254,9.2288,1.6299,6.3592,0.4718,3.3419,1.7449,4.9967,1.0637,3.0357,0.6927,5.8648,2.2422,4.6708,11.2091,3.5171,0.6083,1.7681,4.8784,0.0153,4.212,0.6168,2.3255,1.8189,3.1153,2.1138,3.8495,7.2182,0.091,1.7587,2.5878,7.419,8.0145,7.0222,0.5692,1.3212,4.5694,4.0819,2.109,1.4009,0.5043,2.5117,3.7722,2.2082,2.7732,0.426,4.8515,0.4472,3.227,2.5979,2.4295,8.9034,2.0122,3.7151,1.2071,4.156,0.0517,3.1344,2.1249,5.044,5.4927,2.8094,1.3499,3.0262,0.0118,5.8356,9.7537,0.5129,1.9608,0.4196,2.0553,5.0457,0.4439,4.833,2.668,2.4601,1.3017,4.3144,2.9643,1.2154,5.6172,0.8622,2.8687,1.1586,2.1339,5.4293,0.152,1.6955,1.3114,8.6425,4.2351,3.9239,0.4594,2.436,1.8196,5.1934,2.942,0.1361,2.0548,1.4698,0.7762,1.9593,4.5894,4.305,0.5077,4.0598,0.8364,2.2306,7.0964,6.6165,5.2256,2.5042,4.8896,5.6609,5.4159,1.4707,4.3099,0.4229,2.1302,0.0834,4.3151,1.0493,2.0615,4.361,3.4719,6.1775,2.1377,4.6049,4.8667,0.8798,0.5539,3.32,3.5654,3.9999,3.344,4.6271,0.1571,1.1582,5.2367,5.2432,2.3984,2.0146,0.8192,2.5263,3.2442,4.5758,0.4394,0.1369,0.6637,4.395,2.153,1.8328,2.5613,6.1477,1.6931,3.3272,6.3047,2.383,1.2609,3.8114,2.0578,3.1014,2.8142,1.361,6.547,3.9819,1.9009,2.4321,0.9326,1.085,1.8161,7.6105,0.702,7.4252,1.1831,3.2077,1.1446,4.4606,6.7851,2.7055,1.4592,2.1303,3.5349,1.3235,1.7003,0.438,1.0922,3.9124,4.2214,4.8901,1.5953,5.9668,1.4691,5.5634,4.5181,3.7626,2.7045,3.5571,1.5748,1.4153,1.1105,0.9069,1.6357,4.7304,0.0666,3.3415,2.8856,8.1706,3.7279,2.1042,1.8387,5.1439,2.1562,5.2421,4.0125,0.5263,6.2744,6.3627,1.9034,1.7389,2.6798,1.9846,6.8058,1.0093,4.0993,0.6646,0.9872,3.9469,0.5364,2.6146,4.0442,0.8669,5.0795,5.6649,2.641,3.75,1.745,3.4441,4.3448,0.6572,2.3306,1.0795,2.9127,3.8207,1.2314,0.6111,5.194,3.1294,0.6145,5.376,4.7217,3.2907,2.6832,2.3709,2.882,4.759,1.0033,2.2661,0.4341,2.2067,4.4264,0.0504,1.3871,1.0279,1.8677,4.4632,2.455,0.4636,4.8815,1.2502,2.5823,2.2646,4.9253,0.7429,3.1009,4.7888,3.9519,0.6075,3.4191,0.1428,0.3557,4.0853,3.5002,1.7913,3.0051,1.5667,0.9293,2.6673,2.4197,3.0518,1.511,5.6666,1.5287,9.0578,1.2359,4.7799,0.2852,1.0191,2.543,2.0955,2.9573,3.8148,3.665,2.6067,2.4442,0.0964,0.7449,0.8481,6.0946,0.0206,0.7029,0.0749,3.2766,2.1399,3.6726,0.5046,3.6663,0.0171,4.0495,3.2354,2.6254,2.4677,7.0542,0.421,0.256,3.4407,0.3942,6.1718,1.4129,5.396,4.1743,2.0782,2.5974,2.7203,1.7844,0.6572,1.2861,4.3124,1.4197,5.0033,1.4454,5.1568,2.2449,4.8709,6.2396,2.7325,1.4711,5.3457,5.6819,2.7293,3.1936,4.8285,4.0239,2.4995,1.1224,0.8125,0.8179,3.9201,1.767,2.5866,4.1024,5.4316,1.4881,6.0633,0.7641,4.6479,1.7216,5.9508,3.0426,2.9855,3.0514,1.3352,0.5554,0.3035,1.2571,2.0411,0.8336,6.6307,3.7411,2.6945,4.3202,2.0589,4.5374,3.663,1.7472,5.8317,0.4975,2.8719,0.655,2.6748,0.6839,0.5812,4.0409,4.6319,1.3051,7.3876,4.048,5.2755,4.5292,1.1549,8.1758,0.0013,0.2955,6.0782,1.1533,5.2494,0.5494,3.1186,0.192,0.2255]}

{"prompt":"WW1 Story","text":"WW1 Story #9\nThis post is being made public after one year of the request for public data.\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@C.Lemon\/it-cloud-computing-technologies-becoming-very-secure-1cc97e35bc8g\nWe all have seen the huge impact of social media on our daily lives. From the time we wake up to sleep at night, it is present in every aspect of our lives. From catching the bus, to going for an occasional dinner, social media is with us all the time. It is also present when you are looking for a job and recruiters are actively using social media, even today for job announcements. There is even social media for job search. The Internet and the social network have taken the concept out of the confines of physical environments and brought it online where people can connect and interact with each other based on their interests and hobbies. Social networking sites or social media sites, as one might prefer to call them, is a phenomenon that has transformed the way people communicate and socialize. These days, the internet is where you meet new opportunities and make new connections, but that means there are a lot of distractions online. Your time online can be unfolded into an array of different activities that are of interest to you and you need to stay alert to what the social media offers and to stay away from what it does not! If you use your smart phone, your account will become public and will be available to anyone!\nI have seen a variety of things on social media and a lot of it is of the highest quality, both artistic and creative work. We are becoming a more visual society and many are using the internet to express themselves in a creative and original style.

{"prompt":"A young teenager bullIed relentlessly , wishes one night in bed to Die so he doesnt have to face pain anymore . Remarkably Death appears to explain to him the importance of life and why he needs to live","text":"A young teenager bullIed relentlessly, wishes one night in bed to Die so he doesnt have to face pain anymore. Remarkably Death appears to explain to him the importance of life and why he needs to live, though he doesnt seem to understand what'life'actually is. Later in the book he is shown as the same kid, living with family and doing other things. In the end of the book we see how he came to that decision. This is something of an odd book that could be seen as sci-fi or a bit of a black comedy and then the ending comes as a surprise and isnt really a logical conclusion.\nDeceased was the person who killed them, the rest of the families died without ever knowing why. Was I expecting a logical ending or is death actually in charge here. Somewhere in the end I think the author was hoping for something else.\nIn the end it ended up being a really interesting story about death and life and the mystery surrounding'why'we die even though we know there must be a reason.\nMy friend who was at the party, the one who was in the wheelchair, suddenly turned and pointed at me. \"What's that scribbled on your arm? \"\nI gave up. I know it must have a meaning, he probably said something like a bad thing had happened, I think, though Im not sure what.\nThis book starts like a simple story of a girl and a boy who get into trouble for being late, but the more they try to talk about it I get the feeling things arent quite as simple as they seem.\nThe book is told in a 3rd person point of view alternating between the two leads as their point of view is revealed. One is the boy and they both try to defend themselves, telling the true story of the incident that led to their late appearance. As the story is told the reader learns just a little bit more about what really went down.\nAs the story progresses, the point of view develops further but the main focus will be the story of the boy and his attempt to explain what had happened to the girl who was in the wheelchair.","token_len":439,"entropy":[8.2558,5.9636,14.1439,10.9519,5.0866,9.9742,2.8737,12.9443,6.1751,4.8479,5.381,5.4045,2.5636,9.4897,8.0373,1.9854,7.8114,2.0605,0.2483,4.9559,5.9809,4.9287,0.8714,9.0729,4.1274,0.0859,8.3101,5.9562,1.3185,7.9181,2.6417,0.7052,2.6097,4.8239,0.0338,4.0669,1.3718,5.1647,0.7615,2.5587,0.7989,2.2773,3.2977,4.884,1.2947,3.1219,2.4547,0.2946,1.3339,2.3471,10.4562,10.0959,1.32,4.5397,1.6086,0.4329,5.964,2.0699,0.226,3.573,1.9004,2.8237,2.415,4.9741,3.7678,5.344,4.7034,3.0302,5.4463,1.9802,6.2503,1.4586,5.6422,5.188,0.6982,1.4438,3.4114,1.2701,1.9773,3.5861,0.3765,0.4446,4.3653,1.0545,3.0762,1.807,4.5049,0.2615,6.2969,3.4891,1.4216,4.0804,1.3079,4.8567,4.0951,1.706,2.8738,5.4021,3.4365,4.4645,1.6227,3.8127,0.317,9.1526,0.4172,0.0007,3.1939,2.9511,3.632,0.4763,0.8298,6.113,0.8674,5.3531,4.6392,3.3993,3.1592,5.004,3.7981,1.1766,2.8199,2.9794,3.9249,7.025,2.1556,2.2635,8.2542,0.7512,0.6922,2.3914,9.9391,3.9741,1.0554,5.5936,2.7127,5.7087,0.9939,4.2429,5.8194,1.8922,3.0,7.0837,0.8409,0.632,7.0912,4.6585,5.8771,3.6044,1.2804,4.6634,1.1074,6.2706,5.7398,6.1892,2.0032,6.3502,2.3527,2.3645,3.6095,5.4241,4.501,5.1169,7.5808,4.4676,3.036,9.169,1.2529,0.775,2.2723,3.1561,2.676,2.4841,2.9233,2.6021,4.2669,1.5085,1.6831,4.6803,1.5081,1.3683,3.8368,1.2292,0.7213,3.0293,5.1143,0.9899,0.709,1.1028,4.7497,2.3396,1.7514,3.2242,3.6734,1.1177,3.8274,1.8692,2.5043,6.3353,2.2629,11.8784,4.7675,0.7823,4.6036,3.1458,7.6387,0.4484,1.2947,2.6187,3.4421,5.2704,0.2793,1.725,1.6194,1.5002,1.5165,4.9755,5.0088,3.4283,1.7166,4.0892,0.6074,3.8614,3.0337,3.9455,2.5233,0.6088,2.1215,3.3354,0.8999,6.5072,0.9046,5.9797,4.407,2.3492,4.9849,1.1515,1.3912,1.4396,1.4793,2.7537,2.2149,2.3172,12.7107,1.5881,0.6808,1.2232,3.7053,2.1859,5.2868,2.6203,1.5737,5.0473,3.3678,1.8521,1.3245,5.2642,2.4938,4.8077,0.5394,6.432,3.1097,1.8519,5.3407,5.3528,3.4092,1.5916,1.9612,5.6095,5.5152,3.0145,6.6408,0.5744,2.2046,2.9126,3.3301,3.621,4.7767,9.8163,0.9924,0.2209,1.9412,2.0953,1.3449,4.2513,2.9492,5.4684,5.3577,1.4956,5.4894,1.3967,2.3768,1.6504,2.8614,2.9627,1.5707,1.2219,1.7024,4.0309,2.2596,2.6709,1.607,2.0659,4.5614,3.2571,2.2663,3.2993,4.8277,2.7997,2.7781,0.2662,3.2762,0.9496,0.6465,6.2073,2.0226,1.6432,1.6441,5.292,1.3378,7.064,2.77,1.1955,0.7407,0.4991,1.025,0.8511,0.2481,1.4118,2.1615,2.36,2.3093,4.8027,1.1011,1.2676,6.6066,2.3597,0.0912,5.7056,0.1888,0.0084,11.4604,0.5753,2.2703,1.7008,6.7797,4.1554,4.3956,6.9946,0.0617,0.0543,1.8453,6.0733,0.7329,4.6634,2.5381,1.826,4.0364,1.6972,5.7053,2.4539,4.5517,0.1487,6.6294,0.8423,1.9384,6.1335,1.6971,8.1029,0.2253,0.8832,2.321,2.9542,3.3362,2.6957,0.3707,1.0205,7.2415,5.6183,0.7176,4.8909,1.1198,1.2164,4.493,0.5083,0.9575,3.015,3.3912,5.4002,4.622,1.0103,1.0143,0.7449,0.0742,2.8673,3.595,3.1707,0.2074,1.6854,0.7225,4.024,1.0556,0.6838,0.5195,2.9883,1.0441,5.9974,0.1614,0.0168,4.8779,3.9384,5.0938,1.8165,3.7708,3.9581,6.1569,1.468,2.8515,2.9256,1.1087,1.0716,1.8888,0.8505,1.5852,5.3428,0.0934,4.2625,1.8973,3.7227,0.1516,1.3319,2.8038,1.485,3.5859,1.2142,2.0001,0.3104,0.052,0.4795]}
{"prompt":"One day , scientists discover a common human trait was in fact a communicable disease .","text":"One day, scientists discover a common human trait was in fact a communicable disease. As a result all humans everywhere are affected by the new and ever developing mutant human syndrome. Soon the only cure that can possibly save mankind is a global vaccination campaign. Everyone will be vaccinated against the new viral disease. But unfortunately the doctors will forget an unfortunatly infected patient. So now the only possible way to save this patient is to keep the vaccine out of the hands of him. Who will do that?\nIn the midst of all the chaos and confusion the only hope for mankind is to work together to save this patient before the infection spreads. But now there is a conspiracy that is working against us. In fact all the doctors are being infected by the virus and the only way to save them and everyone else is to destroy the vaccine.\nI play with the new concept and make use of the 3D environment to create a tense, suspensive game where all the players play in the same game world.\nFrom the start I wanted to make it like a FPS where the game is focused on real time. A lot of the mechanics like movement, aiming and using the keyboard are designed in such a way as to follow the real time aspect of the game.\nI used many of the ideas from the FPS to do this. For movement I used a direction based movement (based on the mouse). I use the mouse as a virtual controller to move around. Instead of aiming a pistol at a point on the screen, you aim at a virtual point on screen and shoot with the mouse.\nThere is a camera which you use to view the map, with 3D objects appearing on different sides. This part was inspired by the idea that when you are shooting in a FPS you always have the view of the world through the POV of the gun you are aiming. A POV here means an angle, like viewing the world in a 90 degree angle or so.\nAfter the game starts there will always be something moving on screen. The movement will be based on real time motion based game physics and the environment will show signs of being affected by the players movement, like falling over and exploding.","token_len":439,"entropy":[6.8149,1.4456,8.7773,6.3808,1.7502,5.9326,5.7056,4.1411,8.8046,5.3206,0.7709,1.6923,10.2212,1.1522,0.2624,1.1204,5.0414,1.7411,0.2514,8.0546,2.809,8.3811,1.4548,2.9766,1.533,1.5253,6.7314,5.7422,6.4412,7.0523,6.9168,4.0182,3.7846,0.476,6.7245,2.4519,5.0808,2.0021,3.9762,1.2549,4.6849,2.3685,2.6319,0.611,2.1144,5.9767,3.5647,1.2171,0.9441,5.8789,2.8428,0.932,1.027,2.5035,0.7588,1.3468,5.7848,1.0551,1.0926,3.1453,5.9628,2.1647,6.9337,3.5414,6.4904,7.4495,11.0393,3.2797,2.7325,0.7537,7.6554,2.6636,1.663,4.2296,4.3835,1.5036,2.8767,4.4398,2.2071,0.4451,1.0466,5.5123,2.9555,0.3,0.5127,4.9778,1.7371,3.218,4.3015,0.1049,0.5836,0.2479,0.0032,8.0959,2.1276,5.5017,1.1017,2.7247,1.37,0.2607,2.0799,6.4838,1.4268,5.8184,0.0024,2.1234,1.8852,4.855,1.394,3.1155,2.8615,5.2544,2.4183,1.7998,2.7229,0.343,1.2692,6.7375,0.3167,0.9946,1.2973,2.1698,1.6533,5.7183,1.6893,5.4893,0.6829,1.1691,2.4098,4.3044,2.8919,0.4578,1.2378,5.3667,2.6083,1.628,3.8455,1.551,2.1436,0.9824,3.4534,3.6822,3.9168,1.1865,3.5388,1.6104,3.8603,4.6412,1.3176,1.1276,1.6067,1.9166,2.5284,0.9901,0.931,0.3882,1.155,1.5729,5.4543,3.5999,0.4365,0.4129,0.146,5.0625,0.9318,2.0331,0.8838,2.2434,4.6271,9.1184,3.0336,1.4689,4.0638,7.0869,3.0947,4.3104,4.5759,0.0209,1.1691,6.8784,1.3721,5.0088,1.0803,0.9848,1.18,8.9989,2.459,15.4654,3.4891,3.4263,2.7662,3.3361,0.8169,2.0208,4.2206,2.6942,2.1115,1.4044,3.1996,1.8353,0.6767,1.8847,5.37,0.8976,3.0018,1.5625,2.0251,0.2638,1.7592,2.999,3.9705,0.7742,7.2291,2.5027,1.6583,2.5847,1.8735,5.2809,0.2977,4.9119,1.4578,2.8996,4.5523,1.8799,0.0869,1.1816,4.1566,6.3998,2.5184,0.9246,4.5739,1.11,5.3252,2.0471,4.6504,0.92,3.9065,3.1085,1.3697,0.0858,0.0556,3.4426,0.068,7.725,0.724,3.1034,1.5632,9.2184,0.5198,0.2785,0.277,0.434,1.3283,2.0738,4.0292,4.5304,3.0672,0.2248,4.6034,1.2253,1.0491,4.8883,3.447,5.8058,2.1244,1.7731,3.4587,9.0571,1.6738,1.0739,1.9229,8.7852,3.6648,2.7909,5.3886,5.6621,0.0979,1.096,4.1358,2.9397,1.9049,4.228,1.5164,2.521,2.1461,0.739,5.519,3.1597,2.055,1.7996,2.4278,2.1842,6.6034,0.0388,4.7602,3.8422,6.3255,1.9609,1.4852,5.9835,2.766,0.2449,0.6569,1.0148,3.3885,2.3563,2.2219,0.979,4.6088,4.0639,1.7208,4.0928,1.9687,2.9669,4.1895,1.2984,1.3317,0.32,1.2676,3.7602,1.4264,1.0607,5.3187,3.5633,2.8002,2.0667,0.1625,2.516,0.5326,3.3034,2.6337,4.9259,4.3792,0.2969,3.0184,6.2303,1.9315,5.9661,2.2511,1.6541,3.1673,6.568,3.4654,4.5966,0.1371,0.9828,4.4876,2.8535,3.5369,0.7898,2.3583,2.8143,3.3235,1.2594,5.384,1.373,4.0145,1.8173,2.1309,4.2322,0.9329,0.3984,2.1673,5.1957,0.5773,6.2881,0.9091,0.3324,4.5928,3.8031,0.502,1.3691,2.4704,5.0476,5.7853,8.6423,1.4993,5.5852,2.8477,3.9249,4.1116,7.5038,1.0762,1.7239,2.0901,1.1,6.5607,0.0504,1.1677,3.4472,6.5379,0.3176,0.8489,4.9369,1.9942,1.7072,3.4431,3.4967,3.4303,4.1178,0.0162,4.5176,3.8211,2.1591,1.7124,0.953,2.338,4.325,3.0777,1.0421,2.3925,0.0803,4.7739,0.4388,5.3043,4.7701,4.7688,3.6303,2.4452,2.0604,4.6885,0.5929,4.9676,7.6669,0.0719,4.1758,4.0503,0.1534,0.4873,7.3038,1.4153,3.7055,2.6577,4.7603,3.8132,2.4987,4.433,0.3782]}

Inside the carriage is a small chest filled with gold coins. He goes back to town to sell his finds. The priest tells the new priest about the treasure. The old priest wants to marry his daughter to the rich new one. When the priest sees the precious coins, he falls dead and the young priest is crowned as the new High Priest of the church. You are the new priest, and you know you can only be the High Priest after a confession of sin. You can only be the High Priest if you can answer without looking at those gold coins. Can you? The new High Priest goes home and waits for his confession. But in the confessional there's a man who has committed adultery and murdered his children. Could you confess it if I looked at the gold coins in this case?\nIf I had some extra money, would I buy : a car or a boat? A plane ticket or a ticket to space? A good book or an electronic gadget? A big house or a new flat? What I would buy depends on what I had left after buying things I thought I needed like clothes. Sometimes a little luxury helps to give a sense of belonging to our society. It was once enough to have food on the table of your bedroom and a simple suit of clothes to wear. Now people have a lot of money and they seem to need a lot of things to feel better : clothes, cars, trips, computers, etc.\nThe man who buys his mother a book with a picture on it and a label says, Mother, what do you think of this book? The mother says, What's on the cover? The man says, A rabbit. A nice, black rabbit. The mother looks at the picture on the cover and says, Yes, it's pretty cute. The man says, Now if it's something I would really like? How can I help it? The mother smiles and says, No. This is something I'm doing for me. So I can see myself more. I can have a different life from the one we've been having.","token_len":440,"entropy":[12.2598,8.5762,4.796,1.9359,0.6721,7.8096,3.8253,0.9959,3.6027,1.3466,4.8276,1.936,5.2535,0.9433,4.6671,11.7439,5.7089,1.4244,2.4422,0.7379,7.0696,1.0767,5.8345,1.9494,0.3577,3.2198,5.4395,2.7513,0.0102,2.7519,1.6148,0.6939,3.3233,4.7989,2.8609,0.5035,7.1446,2.0945,4.9652,2.2961,8.182,0.6712,2.305,5.8284,2.9703,2.9071,6.9666,3.1192,2.8489,0.7537,3.8655,1.3679,1.2712,2.9319,0.084,5.3334,0.5247,6.7179,2.9136,0.9862,2.85,1.7125,4.9286,5.9127,5.5035,0.6815,3.9749,0.8123,2.4232,3.073,0.8643,7.7543,1.822,0.7583,0.2974,4.6126,5.6874,3.4829,1.737,3.0055,1.4485,2.3149,6.1219,2.6924,2.0072,0.6723,7.6506,0.1621,1.2923,1.0208,4.1916,0.177,6.6624,3.429,2.4509,2.1911,1.4403,1.8916,1.5289,1.3912,4.9385,3.9338,1.703,6.3154,2.2579,1.8012,2.9919,0.02,5.2099,3.5379,8.3638,2.0611,3.4361,0.4293,2.252,3.3085,1.5731,0.6383,0.655,0.5947,0.012,2.4568,0.1617,4.6895,5.3562,9.5432,5.8618,1.2933,5.2261,2.9226,0.0265,0.3594,6.8457,0.2939,3.5312,2.3272,2.2269,2.4846,0.0027,5.164,4.6945,1.127,5.8524,0.4419,1.9462,6.5377,0.4276,3.8906,4.4085,0.6086,8.7499,0.0433,4.1431,1.6746,0.738,4.9304,1.5088,2.8253,6.1834,2.4469,2.2634,5.314,0.5167,5.1155,0.3091,6.2839,0.8392,5.1346,3.6968,5.3936,4.9529,7.2183,0.2932,1.4546,1.1482,0.0844,3.3105,4.4381,3.7965,0.3656,3.8193,6.1943,3.2851,3.4996,6.0417,5.8427,1.0056,0.8678,3.8654,0.4557,3.7768,11.5304,5.1337,4.0343,3.1334,0.544,2.9289,1.407,3.6954,6.1166,2.56,2.1163,0.4403,3.7159,0.3126,9.2447,1.3424,1.4329,5.4573,3.0603,1.7951,2.9745,6.482,4.2633,0.7586,1.54,5.3336,3.1434,1.3787,0.4265,5.6357,4.5638,0.6656,4.0218,4.6929,2.2506,1.6636,6.3215,0.1604,1.9143,1.1528,4.0032,4.0954,3.4985,5.2822,6.5105,3.4399,4.1006,1.0952,3.4792,7.1083,3.4207,2.8872,5.5015,3.4088,4.0716,6.2658,5.2191,3.3059,3.817,2.1173,3.0893,0.0281,4.2528,1.5397,6.7005,2.2936,0.3675,3.3607,4.9829,3.7397,6.3807,0.4484,2.9094,6.7799,3.2234,1.359,0.1439,6.0195,4.548,6.5553,2.9712,1.448,6.5518,6.3216,1.8669,1.5225,2.3817,3.1339,1.8378,2.9271,4.932,2.4232,2.8117,2.84,0.9773,2.3143,1.5502,2.5471,6.1874,0.3842,4.7847,2.1021,1.3614,0.5958,2.0987,1.4511,4.3762,4.2239,6.8915,2.9529,0.2635,4.0526,0.1845,8.1303,1.2923,5.2912,0.4495,3.3661,0.1172,2.3414,2.6778,4.7619,1.5301,6.34,3.9611,5.8577,2.0583,3.9771,4.2084,1.3544,2.9033,2.916,0.1471,2.8823,2.4099,7.6375,3.7147,1.473,11.4657,1.0925,3.698,1.5494,0.1111,1.8653,1.6217,1.3543,0.62,0.5134,2.8524,3.4561,1.0963,0.5226,3.8863,2.8888,5.2076,1.5674,2.2523,0.7373,1.5514,1.6017,0.9809,0.1541,4.5823,10.86,2.0968,3.7761,5.8161,4.2342,5.8672,0.9216,0.6459,1.4624,1.3696,4.4963,0.365,0.5927,2.9937,2.089,0.1251,1.5303,0.4496,0.4611,0.1729,4.2218,0.4775,2.1138,0.4725,5.6257,4.1021,0.4949,0.8897,0.6646,0.5358,0.1238,4.2363,4.1744,2.6253,1.0267,5.4386,2.2453,2.9892,3.9872,0.4037,6.88,6.4273,2.7422,0.6817,3.3903,2.6095,0.4096,0.9736,1.0359,4.387,0.6215,0.2299,0.1832,3.8684,2.1849,4.6881,0.9709,4.4109,0.7203,3.7384,4.5602,1.951,4.9661,0.6314,4.1915,1.2991,4.3604,4.0393,4.3863,5.6152,2.5814,1.8389,1.9204,4.4505,1.3289,4.8923,1.9365,4.4826,1.2338,0.9676,4.6306,2.595,1.0002,4.9833,0.8562]}

{"prompt":"What if tattoos just randomly appeared on our skin at key points in our lives and we had to figure out what they meant for ourselves .","text":"What if tattoos just randomly appeared on our skin at key points in our lives and we had to figure out what they meant for ourselves. I don't think we'll find out but if you've got tattoos that are significant and you ask yourself why you got them or do you feel better with them do something about it do something positive about them. As much as they make you feel like you're giving the world a gift and showing that you care and that you have faith in a higher power or believe that you belong to this greater whole or maybe you get the tattoo inspired from something in a book or a movie or a band or a show or something that's relevant to you then get rid of it. Just get rid of them.\nBut for most of our tattoos they'll probably never really get a chance to tell us what they really mean to us so I'd rather just let them live with and let them grow on me. And don't be afraid to remove whatever tattoo seems like a mess or is out of place. Because all you have to worry about is that other people who look at you like you're insane and feel bad for you and make fun of you or think you're crazy for having that tattoo or feeling the way that you feel.\nAnd don't be afraid to ask for an artist who works really good at removing tattoos don't be afraid to look around the internet and look for a place to have the tattoo done. And again just find someone who really is good with these sort of things and you don't have to have just one of them. You can really have as many as you want and as many that you want so make sure you do your research and find a good place where they're just experienced and they're going to be able to figure out and remove the tattoo perfectly.

{"prompt":"After a long journey through mountains and valleys , slaying beasts and villains , the heroes lay down their swords and gather around a table , order some booze and start playing their favourite game : Ties & Offices","text":"After a long journey through mountains and valleys, slaying beasts and villains, the heroes lay down their swords and gather around a table, order some booze and start playing their favourite game : Ties & Offices. The game is simple: every player is given 1 (or 2) cards on the left hand side of the board. Everyone must try to have 5 cards on the board without using any cards they have already got (no more cards on the table).\nAt the very first round, everyone sits down on a table, one by one. There is a card that you cannot see lying on the table. You must then try to turn the card over, while a member of your group is sitting next to you and another is standing beside you. The player who can\u2019t see the card must then make a guess on how many of its sides are exposed. The person next to him makes his\/her guess as well, and then the person next to them, etc \u2026 The aim is to guess the correct number of sides and win if nobody does. If you guess the right number of sides, you\u2019ll get that many cards, and the player who did not guess well gets a card.\nThe game is pretty easy to understand: you only have to think and make decisions according to what the other people are doing.\nIn order to win, you have to be a great team leader: if you\u2019re the person who is always the last to make a move (because everybody else is so slow, no wonder they always win in the end, right! ), you should consider not doing any moves at all. Instead, you\u2019ll have to wait and be patient. The person who wants to be the leader of this group should try to make his\/her decisions as soon as possible.\nI won the game a few times (especially if there were two or more leaders to make the decision quickly, hahaha!)\nAnyway, the next round is pretty much the same: we all sit down on our seats, make up our group, the person with 5 cards on the board must now start to play. Then, everyone tries to win again.","token_len":442,"entropy":[3.1393,3.3791,4.7223,2.208,6.3981,1.1629,1.8817,0.4419,12.0675,3.9297,1.1421,8.3324,0.6385,3.1222,5.3048,8.0282,2.6859,0.2356,3.48,0.7692,6.7304,4.1733,2.454,4.5619,2.1777,8.773,4.5535,6.691,1.0433,5.5057,3.8138,4.2176,3.3413,2.2115,8.584,7.1871,6.821,4.8874,8.9297,4.8212,0.9011,2.9246,1.9446,1.2775,3.5896,2.89,5.5147,1.8087,2.7849,1.9731,4.979,4.8666,1.9048,1.1608,0.3563,3.6016,4.8233,1.6578,6.513,1.9053,0.5839,0.5134,0.4716,2.4927,1.2703,6.0449,3.3934,5.1371,0.7776,5.3185,4.9008,1.6676,1.1984,0.4283,5.442,6.8045,4.6364,1.3731,1.6715,3.3921,1.6716,1.5423,5.0285,3.4756,4.7549,3.5253,3.4679,3.2012,0.3401,1.5955,1.5036,3.2875,6.6852,0.6986,4.8222,4.6896,3.2049,0.7799,2.2092,6.6401,0.4608,2.2966,1.7155,0.7603,1.9553,4.0096,2.4873,0.0009,1.9122,4.0468,1.075,0.878,5.7809,2.5228,3.136,4.9958,3.1041,8.2747,0.9541,0.2648,0.2987,1.1923,2.4984,2.0343,3.4933,2.8031,0.3597,5.1184,1.538,1.4045,1.9063,2.5953,5.8572,3.9546,5.0427,0.0657,1.424,3.036,2.1748,2.3574,2.0547,0.0025,0.3508,2.7725,5.6826,2.235,2.1487,3.4542,0.2055,0.4741,1.8083,2.8972,1.2816,4.5422,17.6164,8.4001,1.4904,2.0231,0.7487,0.3618,1.9103,2.1305,3.9134,0.33,5.2607,2.816,2.622,1.5777,3.1012,4.2082,5.1664,0.843,6.5053,0.7778,1.6863,3.8844,3.2149,0.0069,4.0554,5.3008,2.4723,5.6804,0.0029,0.3127,3.4788,2.1823,1.4645,1.3365,2.4247,1.6294,2.3929,0.5982,0.0131,1.8461,4.5164,7.66,7.2051,2.9453,9.1944,0.5744,0.2379,4.7708,1.3761,2.2973,1.8605,0.3848,2.9687,2.5245,7.6162,4.743,7.0944,4.4323,0.6976,2.8852,1.8355,4.2586,1.6879,1.5798,0.1783,1.2717,0.5176,0.4238,0.9318,14.1697,0.1299,0.3771,2.4241,4.8802,6.1549,1.0372,2.4846,1.4473,2.3983,2.6661,0.6392,4.4645,0.7948,1.1493,7.7045,2.9647,2.1388,3.215,1.0508,1.3475,1.8732,1.246,1.3905,4.2892,2.6562,1.1895,2.3674,3.307,2.0466,3.8425,0.7251,0.4172,2.7662,4.1712,3.4398,2.8897,5.1839,0.0033,2.2519,2.1838,2.4774,3.661,1.5754,1.3926,0.5573,2.516,3.6394,2.6123,0.1241,1.5229,0.7316,0.7352,1.7189,0.0324,3.6796,3.175,4.3464,3.9464,3.3994,3.4886,3.3614,0.4115,9.0207,0.1162,2.6658,2.446,4.5086,0.753,2.5407,4.5981,3.7861,5.0805,0.5892,3.1585,0.6328,2.3549,3.8068,3.9541,5.3345,1.1676,0.9216,4.6281,3.6938,2.5382,4.8777,4.8378,1.5828,3.5789,3.4052,3.892,1.2173,0.8047,2.2787,2.3334,8.3863,1.3537,1.054,3.4753,6.5152,5.0744,3.9776,1.9957,2.2741,2.2379,0.0197,0.8317,4.2686,0.2393,0.9767,3.5698,0.1252,0.3067,3.0251,0.2055,4.4997,2.3436,4.2078,3.6863,1.5216,3.0318,4.5965,0.9105,5.9611,0.1175,3.668,0.7264,3.1398,1.6722,4.4756,2.3093,1.8895,3.1799,0.2749,2.4479,3.3258,0.1246,0.0011,4.117,2.211,2.1724,0.0075,0.0977,1.0056,1.2224,4.2336,4.6312,2.2578,0.8295,4.7251,1.7215,0.9853,3.7387,5.652,3.3064,3.682,1.1966,3.5582,1.7482,0.5559,6.8457,5.0693,4.2707,1.9343,3.1343,7.0556,1.8142,9.0347,0.9695,0.7498,2.4853,2.6984,5.3978,0.122,2.4053,3.4467,0.8916,1.3482,4.0945,1.5045,1.8119,0.4624,2.2174,4.0792,2.8669,1.1091,0.6511,1.17,3.5234,4.63,1.2965,4.9007,3.8977,0.78,6.0532,1.2941,6.1436,2.4475,3.2905,6.3126,0.4527,1.3722,0.0514,3.6676,3.6326,5.7305,4.1753,2.1732,1.9408,3.0021,3.3503,1.2169,2.5291,4.6152,0.2334,4.2087,4.7084,1.278]}

I wanted to go on a bit longer with the characters and the situations she faced, but in the end the writing fell short, as I got stuck too many times. Having to rewind and restart was a pain.\nI did think that the ending had something to do with the title and the rest of the message it conveyed, but the ending took forever to get there, and the characters weren\u2019t much of a part in the whole. She may have had a problem, but she never seemed much of a character to me anyway.\nThe writing is solid and the characters do a solid job of standing out, but I just can\u2019t get hooked on the whole package. It feels like it was built to be successful.\nThere is nothing more dangerous than a child. As well as being a beautiful thing, they also have a capacity to change any adult in a matter of seconds. And when it comes to death, a child is no more valuable than anyone else. There have been many cases of children dying unnaturally in recent years, and even though the police have been trying to establish a reason why certain children were killed (as the police may have their own agenda), so far no answers have come out. This makes it even more dangerous for the next child that they should get hit with, just because they happen to be the first.\nAnd so, after reading about the death of the five-year- old girl, Grace, two adults are accused of killing her. Two adults that were present when Grace died, and two adults that were not present but are connected in some way to the case. But two adults, who, together, seemed to have nothing to do with it at all. And yet, it has been revealed that one of the adults, a police officer, found the body with another police officer. And even though the police have their own way to deal with the situation, the police are forced to investigate themselves. In a situation where you can\u2019t avoid anything, you are forced to find the truth that is hidden deep inside.","token_len":442,"entropy":[8.0605,4.4272,1.9991,8.241,3.4962,4.0827,4.2465,4.8752,2.7373,4.1634,2.2608,0.8883,1.4348,7.4154,4.9555,2.8888,0.7924,2.7487,5.5404,1.6506,1.4236,4.8546,0.6991,3.7356,4.1331,1.6593,3.6783,0.944,3.8102,1.4019,6.5784,2.133,2.4481,7.8884,8.3076,4.0648,1.6397,0.3028,4.9156,1.1312,0.0897,3.0497,4.4892,6.3335,2.7128,3.3253,3.127,1.546,4.5341,3.454,6.6126,2.9901,0.2414,1.3234,7.0479,2.2601,3.6485,1.1332,2.1345,6.0062,4.2244,1.4953,1.5461,1.3302,1.2742,1.8175,3.6502,4.9539,2.0913,1.6527,3.2275,3.6029,3.3611,0.1893,0.0302,0.0012,0.9708,6.35,2.4098,1.5843,6.59,0.1332,0.2007,7.0603,4.7556,2.8831,1.5549,0.4049,2.765,2.1446,5.8735,4.4503,0.3425,2.5351,4.0747,2.2288,1.3067,2.3363,3.2754,3.6527,15.1696,6.9194,3.471,5.3086,1.8715,0.4201,1.7165,5.1939,0.6456,4.4381,1.5804,6.4731,5.2794,0.5606,2.5969,1.2479,5.6416,2.4197,0.3391,1.8232,4.1736,3.7222,5.0649,0.4416,0.1467,4.0621,2.5603,0.1289,4.9099,0.3862,0.8565,2.383,4.1211,2.3716,4.4213,1.4818,2.0418,1.9562,4.2561,1.1219,3.6674,0.0096,0.9815,6.1286,0.5331,2.2783,0.9203,1.7757,4.0824,2.3147,10.2324,0.6224,0.0825,2.2165,8.8839,0.7095,1.7161,2.4198,6.2399,0.377,3.1161,3.4743,0.4341,2.3959,1.6614,5.329,2.0229,1.0519,8.2621,2.2568,0.9262,4.1985,1.7669,3.5856,4.2242,7.7647,0.4294,1.8687,6.6311,4.2732,5.4035,5.567,0.153,1.6451,1.4863,5.8801,4.0206,0.6967,4.0779,2.4431,1.2613,1.0952,7.4562,0.7265,3.6763,6.5447,7.8563,2.8441,2.0693,3.7185,0.0148,1.0847,0.3526,4.1307,3.5212,2.6693,0.1829,0.1022,6.9295,0.2715,4.5244,1.4412,1.3351,3.2997,3.3029,5.9832,0.2557,4.058,0.2748,0.7527,4.7402,5.2201,0.2297,2.1957,3.7883,1.1006,1.3216,2.0577,10.9198,0.0246,2.2795,5.7656,0.4494,0.6208,1.3722,3.8081,2.5005,2.3301,5.9392,2.0255,1.9424,3.9838,0.1965,6.5806,1.8348,4.5959,2.2005,6.938,2.1269,2.3519,1.1477,4.4057,3.9014,3.4736,3.1483,5.4536,0.6082,7.2142,0.5584,4.7235,0.9311,5.597,0.5142,2.3304,7.7368,0.2006,1.1415,2.9325,0.5936,4.0264,3.74,1.4078,2.1877,0.356,3.0418,1.3846,1.4177,5.8304,1.583,4.0553,3.6168,4.9108,4.9858,7.5302,1.8191,3.381,5.2564,2.3115,1.2287,5.2972,0.012,0.4053,2.6776,3.9074,2.8542,0.6372,3.6968,3.6298,1.3602,3.8936,3.4798,3.6018,1.4149,4.0561,0.1045,2.578,5.9037,3.0892,0.0764,0.2427,10.8746,1.7327,0.9096,13.0754,1.1418,7.5117,5.8357,3.3755,7.262,0.1317,1.8885,0.5369,0.8947,4.9646,1.8591,5.7311,2.4953,5.1198,2.1635,3.139,1.513,1.4143,1.1973,1.9556,0.4703,0.6721,1.0008,2.1445,1.476,5.7957,3.2263,5.5814,3.4602,0.2995,0.0726,0.7355,0.6553,2.27,0.5604,4.1811,5.3094,0.445,2.8749,2.1695,5.1187,5.3451,0.669,6.7992,0.2781,1.3884,4.2859,0.409,0.0601,0.0349,2.9536,2.3311,0.0639,1.437,2.6886,3.4346,0.7336,3.4697,4.3811,1.3277,2.6753,0.3,2.4422,0.2268,0.6668,0.6601,2.5096,3.2679,4.4212,0.4272,0.5574,6.2678,1.1895,1.4573,5.2426,6.2963,4.3181,0.0282,2.1015,2.1257,4.7994,0.5247,1.2583,1.8088,2.0309,4.9949,0.2118,5.8375,2.8685,2.9624,0.0016,1.6563,2.7404,0.1911,2.1808,2.789,2.4101,5.7636,0.0621,4.7139,5.0472,1.2927,4.312,2.7314,4.5202,0.6549,4.4985,1.7754,10.2473,0.1977,0.0529,6.4203,5.895,1.2059,2.1536,3.0058,1.2015,0.0228,3.9928,2.3786,3.0632,4.1448,2.1803,4.9497,5.2428,1.6407,1.6738]}

{"prompt":"Friends","text":"Friends?\nWell, as you know the family here has a tradition of welcoming visitors a few days out before Christmas.  It all started in the 1960s with my Grandma and Grandpa visiting from Texas and they asked if they could bring a present; they brought a gift basket of spaghetti, pasta and cornmeal.  Some years later Grandpa brought a gift card for a local pizza place. Now if that wasn't fun to cook for, I don't know what is.\nThis year I'm looking forward to trying to bake a really nice dessert: gingerbread.  I'm not sure if I can ever remember a time when we didn't have gingerbread cookies around the holidays.  I remember making the gingerbread in the oven, in which you had to watch the water on the cookie sheet, and you usually only made one at a time.  They must have been pretty tasty.\nAs you know we don't celebrate Christmas in our home until the last weekend in December - not even the big snow storm of 2008.  There were a bunch of little traditions we had that year, but I can only recall eating Christmas Eve dinner; the last Thursday or Friday of December I remember having the turkey in the oven and making the cranberry sauce. I just remember that we put two or more packages of bread stuffing in a big baking dish and then layered the cranberry sauce with the stuffing, then a layer of cranberries on top.  We were supposed to do that until a certain time so we could see the light come through the windows and know it was Christmas Eve.  The turkey and stuffing made for a heavy dinner.\nAs far as presents go, I remember my sister and I each receiving a sweatshirt and slippers, as our grandfather put it in the card that came with our presents.  It was a typical gift for all the grandchildren.\n\nA:\n\nHere's a great post on the history of Christmas in Germany:\nhttp:\/\/www.theeuropeanisland.com\/posts\/history-of-christmas-in-germany \nIt seems that Christmas in Germany has a tradition going back over 500 years.","token_len":443,"entropy":[5.6716,1.2306,11.6817,0.3802,4.6488,1.8519,2.1305,4.7287,7.1085,6.0608,3.018,2.5789,6.4857,0.3619,3.9021,3.5428,7.387,2.1803,1.578,4.9075,4.9666,1.3578,0.923,7.6144,10.941,5.9211,0.6554,1.9275,1.6147,3.8649,0.5563,2.0553,3.9564,6.7003,1.1072,2.0011,2.6728,0.804,3.7067,3.8088,5.6161,2.1682,3.4807,4.2176,1.8149,2.0297,0.0644,3.0122,1.6451,6.0524,7.2289,1.9557,4.3726,1.0123,4.3902,4.6574,3.1556,6.942,1.2515,4.9094,1.4412,5.2934,4.2097,1.0365,0.5709,5.3781,4.4377,0.8182,5.9049,0.5211,2.6287,0.9663,3.0086,5.6167,2.4018,2.5097,4.6612,5.1041,1.9228,1.5579,6.7129,5.1987,3.9055,2.4874,0.0003,4.3107,2.9732,5.8974,2.2122,1.2962,1.6408,1.1697,0.0011,0.0451,0.0555,3.9538,0.3489,2.193,3.9436,2.1616,1.7491,2.5548,4.0588,0.5065,0.0067,4.6077,2.4083,5.4954,1.6138,6.2503,2.8665,4.042,5.6288,6.9135,0.4273,1.3153,0.5555,1.4568,1.7246,1.9271,0.577,1.0867,1.3284,2.1503,4.7993,3.9792,2.1771,1.139,0.4331,3.5116,1.4834,0.0008,1.0865,1.225,0.0218,2.9948,5.4814,3.9995,3.7287,0.9279,0.4576,1.5317,4.0896,4.4468,2.9918,2.7495,0.01,4.2146,1.1348,1.527,2.2707,4.919,5.3202,4.6546,4.3351,0.6398,6.9845,1.3864,5.5467,6.1698,0.46,3.7201,1.9344,2.7391,1.5554,4.0353,6.6104,4.1705,3.4704,1.7357,4.4263,0.0523,0.0012,0.493,0.2022,5.8735,6.788,0.2575,0.992,2.8051,3.5902,1.2555,1.6308,4.3369,1.7332,2.7966,3.804,3.1906,0.0007,4.8652,0.4937,2.1317,3.0413,2.4734,5.4524,2.2107,2.7578,5.4395,1.8267,1.588,5.2137,4.6244,2.7603,2.5632,4.743,6.4044,3.5387,2.225,4.7447,1.5564,0.1643,4.8578,2.535,2.1492,3.5026,0.0141,4.5584,6.345,2.5919,1.3745,2.302,2.5847,1.3961,1.1702,2.4081,3.7234,3.0001,3.0085,7.0523,4.7342,4.4594,4.045,7.5706,3.1789,3.3935,7.2135,5.0849,0.1094,1.4591,1.1727,4.083,3.3146,3.5299,2.8494,3.9502,3.4951,0.9164,1.0208,2.0042,4.0411,1.9245,4.3724,0.0547,0.8786,1.1455,3.7669,4.9247,2.1436,2.8055,3.177,5.9493,5.5879,2.4787,3.3953,5.7475,0.4314,6.1458,7.2002,1.1512,2.703,3.5402,4.2925,0.4392,1.0461,2.233,6.4051,1.8126,2.8123,0.0555,0.0827,2.5973,1.6224,2.6304,2.3127,2.4914,5.4249,3.9162,0.0409,2.4129,2.6366,3.3191,0.007,0.7629,0.5217,3.284,3.089,5.7416,0.0014,3.3546,2.1709,5.2736,4.2595,4.7227,1.4693,5.3116,1.3484,1.0181,4.8192,2.2146,4.8166,6.8421,2.2019,2.028,3.7927,1.6097,5.4439,2.6289,0.2625,2.7269,1.0661,0.3541,0.8392,3.3664,2.8242,2.7326,2.2654,4.1999,2.1183,0.6651,11.0003,2.8173,1.5513,0.8068,3.7241,3.5097,0.0059,7.9431,0.1316,0.4677,1.0219,3.9458,3.1638,3.7292,1.6952,0.3301,6.487,5.34,0.8383,12.1671,0.016,1.6119,6.6549,0.4057,2.2869,3.6784,5.2831,6.8878,4.1484,0.1945,3.1888,1.4475,8.2028,3.644,2.8363,0.2966,1.5193,3.3413,0.322,0.1715,2.6224,0.6161,1.7163,6.8166,4.0687,1.6173,4.6416,2.2776,4.8948,2.4686,2.2283,8.664,4.6203,7.9612,3.2731,0.0513,5.2098,0.6911,1.0995,3.8776,3.0429,1.7227,2.1081,3.8832,0.1537,1.8436,2.6685,5.4444,1.7906,0.6436,9.9915,0.0005,0.6618,0.0006,3.587,6.7087,0.2749,0.086,5.7993,1.3459,0.6196,0.7872,0.0203,6.626,0.0237,5.2263,0.5463,0.6602,0.0013,0.2392,0.0081,0.2955,0.46,0.0025,0.9146,0.0345,7.8503,2.4514,5.8707,3.3609,1.2326,2.9811,1.9983,0.2867,2.0939,3.0575,3.9125,6.1263,0.0472,4.0561,3.1148,0.0411,0.742]}

Mark is one of the Ghost Crew, but that is all we know about him. He seems like all he really wants to do is make his mother proud of him.

He is trying to infiltrate a drug dealers to get some intel that will lead them to the person that ordered his murder. He is getting ready to go into the operation and the other guys start acting crazy. They are all freakin psychotic. Mark realizes he needs to find his own way out.. but he gets caught up in it and when he realizes he is in there, he knows that he does not really want to be in there.. It just happened. It was just a bunch of people trying to hurt him in a very uncool way and he is not proud of it.\nWell Mark goes after the main drug dealer who is named Mark. He kills him and leaves the guy, who is a big guy, bleeding on the floor and goes off alone on a mission. But the guy is not dead, he is still alive and has a really bad head injury. Mark kills him and now can be called a professional killer.","token_len":444,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.5623,2.9819,4.4647,0.0011,0.0001,8.9197,3.1463,2.2869,1.0114,1.9857,7.61,0.9894,1.3257,5.6618,0.9876,3.6852,4.8499,5.7936,5.5379,0.0643,1.4728,4.4494,7.7545,3.0948,10.6039,2.3493,3.9636,1.5191,9.9568,3.9032,3.9461,4.0042,9.0987,0.1025,9.6193,12.4033,8.3511,0.9654,2.1118,3.7964,1.4103,1.1303,0.9387,3.5977,5.7666,6.3205,1.9041,2.6472,4.7499,1.1362,3.7204,0.5693,0.3049,7.6049,4.1596,2.3219,0.8925,1.855,1.0444,0.1419,0.2532,5.1815,1.8528,1.7928,5.5626,5.3282,4.7803,6.135,7.6472,5.1421,0.8978,3.9668,1.8551,1.182,1.1247,6.2028,2.0695,6.1767,2.7479,8.7815,7.0885,9.7575,4.3182,3.919,3.1287,4.4873,3.8321,8.274,2.2704,0.7811,2.4145,4.7286,2.6283,2.2565,1.1212,1.5724,5.4299,4.1625,1.9933,4.9796,2.9101,2.2248,0.3548,5.5747,6.3621,3.2612,6.3532,0.5163,4.1224,5.3667,5.8633,0.2255,6.8342,5.216,3.6753,3.6571,2.7395,3.6993,1.8545,2.8565,4.8454,1.2961,1.945,5.1463,1.0755,2.8714,2.0651,5.1714,0.8061,0.7953,3.5947,7.8193,5.1254,4.3705,3.3929,9.793,2.8233,5.9613,1.7708,1.8826,2.0959,5.255,0.3394,1.4048,2.5272,1.869,1.0011,7.3012,0.8377,4.1332,4.4338,3.4058,6.0296,5.3505,2.4503,4.9163,5.5912,5.0448,1.4207,2.2691,0.7698,5.2045,0.4402,7.0975,0.3514,0.2013,0.226,6.7096,6.0375,2.032,0.9604,0.3026,0.3256,2.6632,11.2315,0.6246,2.6018,0.8574,3.3213,1.209,3.2317,0.0423,0.4377,6.5227,0.4456,2.9182,3.2685,4.8461,1.6978,3.0408,4.164,0.2994,1.1892,0.4207,0.8334,1.4963,4.4409,2.3295,6.5462,3.2649,2.6539,2.4524,0.8402,0.3053,0.1017,3.5677,2.706,5.7282,2.3036,2.761,0.6917,1.2265,1.5821,2.513,6.0991,5.322,0.7522,7.0148,4.7737,3.7415,9.0121,2.274,2.4248,7.0437,8.6853,4.364,6.7334,2.4786,5.8568,4.304,5.5076,1.9685,2.917,4.3302,3.3219,2.5733,0.0264,0.6216,4.2795,0.6148,4.4296,0.6034,2.4437,7.3888,3.8844,0.8834,2.9506,1.3386,4.436,3.8575,4.6812,1.8203,2.5057,0.7953,1.1464,3.5187,0.0268,3.3143,0.9761,3.6023,6.195,5.6426,1.9676,3.5923,6.7922,4.187,1.7986,2.2547,2.5205,0.2202,1.5382,5.4096,2.8111,6.6358,2.4339,2.187,0.2793,1.5165,1.3192,4.6668,3.2928,0.1766,2.1981,2.719,1.0893,7.1837,2.316,4.2047,4.4693,3.0309,4.3214,4.6962,2.9166,0.8865,2.9233,1.9233,2.3092,9.8827,0.4355,6.1058,1.1617,2.5327,4.7304,1.7394,2.8061,0.3423,3.4589,2.9048,3.2642,0.5148,1.2488,4.2698,1.8976,1.1867,3.3549,1.7609,0.8291,0.2187,3.1345,1.4073,4.7295,0.2734,2.9812,0.882,1.2536,1.9061,5.6777,2.6958,0.3038,4.9335,2.7485,0.8276,5.6618,0.4458,4.7814,2.3815,0.192,2.2543,1.7199,1.0564,2.1056,6.6516,4.2807,4.8928,1.7643,3.4924,1.9312,2.5998,1.1489,4.4914,0.0039,2.5258,2.5796,0.0196,5.2954,1.5803,4.6976,1.6066,3.7399,9.4993,2.9988,0.1631,2.9499,1.4978,2.4667,3.2459,6.4548,0.3423,0.6291,0.4033,1.5259,4.3661,4.0236,3.9837,4.3118,0.9061,5.6254,4.6465,0.9965,1.9872,0.8626,4.1465,4.7412,2.9677,0.8601,3.9843,0.7281,1.4808,4.1375,2.0595,4.9881,5.0305,1.7682,1.0109,2.6538,4.6584,2.7519,1.097,5.3042,2.7313,0.1556,0.4697,2.5871,6.7687,3.8693,6.7421,4.1284,1.5159,4.9325,0.9211,3.8297,2.869,1.2168,1.7854,2.4205,2.878,2.5325,0.6865,0.9704,1.9397,1.2153,1.3907,3.2969,2.129,5.7841,2.223,4.8856,1.0113,0.6326,2.222,4.6474,1.0369,1.0032,6.0901,6.5018,3.0231,4.3969,1.0907,7.2782,3.1931,0.6393]}
{"prompt":"Instead of asking your destination , your Uber driver asks if you want to have an adventure","text":"Instead of asking your destination, your Uber driver asks if you want to have an adventure in the city. Or if you do, he adds to the trip the adventure that you want.\nWhen I booked the ride in Paris, the Uber driver asked me if I wanted to ride the Tube to the Louvre. For a second I was really not sure, since it is a very big trip with a lot of stops, but I was thinking that if the driver told me to do that I would like it even more.\nI told him that it was ok and we decided to go for it! The driver asked if I wanted to have any kind of a challenge in Paris and I thought of the Louvre because it is really beautiful and it\u2019s a kind of challenge, so I agreed to it. That way, we made a very long, beautiful and enriching trip together.\nYes, I can! Even if I tell the driver how to route through the city, I can get lost. So you can tell me what you want to see or do while travelling so I can guide you or suggest things to do nearby.\nSome of my recent travel destinations have become a part of a regular tour and so I have developed my knowledge and experience in these cities.\nIf you have a place you want to see, just let me know and I\u2019ll try to help you achieve all of your travel goals. You do not have to book this trip just because you and I want to do it. Some other people might want to do it before or after, so I have the flexibility to adjust it all.\nI am a travel writer, a writer at heart and a creative person.

{"prompt":"The world population clock finally stopped fluctuating . Now it 's just dropping .","text":"The world population clock finally stopped fluctuating. Now it's just dropping. For the first time since 1970, we are witnessing a true population decline.\nA report released by the Population Research Institute in New Delhi last week revealed that India is becoming more and more a developed country with fewer people.\nThe total number of Indians has fallen by 1.5 per cent in 1991-90, even as India had a population growth of 1.6 per cent.\nEven for the first time, there was an absolute decline in the number of people in the 20-29 age group - 1.8 per cent and in the 18-20 age group - 1.5.\nThe report predicts that this will continue in the upcoming decade - the numbers of people will further fall.\n\"We can say that India's population seems to have turned into a developed nation at the moment, considering the decline in population and also the drop in fertility,\" said Dr Subhash Banerjee, the report's author.\nWhen India's total population fell below a billion, experts told TOI, there would be huge challenges of finding jobs, housing and many other problems.\nAt a time when India was struggling with lack of jobs, the current population fall could be a signal of a huge employment problem for young Indians.\n\"A decline in population means you will either have fewer jobs or fewer people for the same number of jobs,\" said Dr Subhash Banerjee, the report's author.\nIndia's total fertility rate (TFR) is 2.6. This is way below its replacement level of 3.5.\nIn 1991, the government adopted a policy for free or subsidised birth control in India. It also decided to raise the TFR.\nEven as the numbers of babies have fallen, the number of deaths have increased.\nSince 1991, there has been a 20 per cent increase in infant and child deaths.\nThe rate of infant and child deaths is more than five times that in other developing countries, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.\nThough the cause of death is difficult to assess, the government survey suggests that the biggest cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal diseases.","token_len":444,"entropy":[6.1109,7.2742,12.1999,9.6775,4.564,8.512,0.0242,2.2314,4.8292,2.0117,0.935,3.5145,7.7322,1.7351,5.3544,1.3591,0.7998,0.0122,1.7751,4.8338,0.2167,2.9458,2.5359,4.1901,1.16,5.9437,5.1134,1.8868,0.7397,1.3256,10.0004,5.4481,1.5559,0.9651,0.3301,3.2519,2.1804,0.4601,2.4379,3.5756,3.759,3.3427,0.8362,3.3066,0.2965,2.1519,1.7751,5.2177,2.3836,1.6252,0.0018,3.3274,3.3922,0.5796,2.2862,4.0484,1.1569,1.6062,1.5846,1.6952,5.9394,0.7487,0.0096,2.9377,3.7594,2.4071,0.877,3.8548,0.2421,2.221,2.597,0.002,1.6834,9.2824,1.1569,5.1106,1.0154,6.0925,0.612,3.2471,4.0949,1.8135,0.5702,2.7107,1.681,2.2033,0.0793,2.3471,0.0672,0.0007,1.2151,1.4005,4.487,5.2273,1.475,2.9824,0.2652,2.0658,3.1039,2.1321,2.5418,4.4469,1.0316,0.335,0.6414,0.6187,0.0077,1.2606,1.9024,1.3557,6.5276,2.0025,1.9408,0.0584,0.3915,4.3354,5.0674,0.2404,2.7481,0.261,0.0003,5.426,5.0921,0.6159,8.9398,0.0762,6.2579,0.2612,0.0105,0.9179,1.7518,0.0335,2.0726,6.9063,0.4689,1.7524,2.5441,6.0066,0.3382,3.1608,1.1124,0.6765,2.5754,0.4154,6.6907,1.7256,3.501,3.2444,8.2488,1.222,1.0815,2.3517,7.2455,2.5745,1.1727,0.3455,2.6126,2.4601,3.6683,3.2605,0.5532,2.0273,1.5054,0.3815,7.7192,0.1264,1.3891,4.8513,1.9099,0.3898,4.6837,2.3784,4.4046,1.1893,2.2871,1.7821,7.9786,1.1207,4.4871,0.2967,1.4447,2.6501,6.2682,0.7735,5.6943,0.0501,3.015,2.2878,0.8517,2.444,6.0584,1.7441,5.8501,0.1231,0.0234,0.1463,2.7176,3.0702,0.0252,1.6396,0.2182,0.1779,5.7299,3.29,1.6093,4.6762,0.3904,2.4492,4.0141,3.9048,2.4695,1.3489,5.5235,5.7525,3.2357,0.0002,1.2186,3.2898,2.7332,0.2531,4.0504,4.5776,4.9466,3.7111,5.6527,1.977,2.8969,0.6012,6.6964,0.1447,3.9326,0.8466,0.246,5.6774,2.832,0.7397,0.0829,1.9078,2.4754,3.2476,1.6742,7.3931,0.0734,2.3134,0.649,1.7454,5.7635,2.6921,7.093,2.4855,1.6659,1.4792,5.3249,1.1555,1.7683,5.2251,8.9415,2.5799,2.3201,4.8887,2.1635,0.5724,0.3702,1.8893,3.7038,4.3396,0.2911,2.8508,3.1751,5.3397,1.6979,6.4311,1.0567,2.6493,1.3486,0.5539,2.9552,1.7342,5.0368,1.4697,3.7946,2.5695,0.0225,1.8785,0.8556,0.4826,1.4551,2.9646,0.0321,0.2531,0.0034,0.0002,1.2082,2.403,1.8023,0.0683,0.5552,0.1137,0.305,3.7856,0.8956,3.8074,2.1978,0.433,3.1643,3.7682,0.0224,0.117,1.356,4.7623,0.0325,2.6934,3.2124,2.49,0.9273,6.5495,0.9311,3.3473,6.8241,1.6581,0.565,2.5304,0.0609,1.707,1.73,0.8928,3.1986,3.2283,0.866,1.4259,5.1526,5.3461,0.8284,1.591,4.7432,8.3222,4.907,2.57,0.013,2.0334,0.114,3.1104,1.7418,0.6042,2.3842,3.0685,5.0076,0.4129,4.5746,0.4274,3.8025,0.05,3.5511,0.8806,5.5264,3.2233,0.9245,4.337,0.4165,4.2342,3.3278,1.185,0.654,0.9768,1.4885,0.0124,4.7496,3.6105,1.653,0.9042,1.1885,4.8815,2.3863,0.0979,2.0226,1.1059,0.0477,0.6171,5.4648,0.6675,0.0019,1.4848,0.0314,4.0179,5.1985,1.2196,0.4297,1.1471,0.901,1.884,4.3721,0.131,2.2783,1.4138,0.048,0.3727,2.37,5.243,0.1288,4.5779,0.1221,1.4125,2.579,4.0473,3.0592,0.1622,1.7006,2.679,0.0016,3.1133,0.9843,2.3939,0.5673,2.3008,0.2346,0.3503,6.0872,1.1956,6.9155,0.2884,1.9027,1.5717,4.6541,0.0165,4.4689,0.2611,1.5443,3.4521,9.4407,3.7053,0.2939,1.5781,6.713,0.8114,0.2145,4.3777,1.5559,0.804,4.6304,3.8374,0.0023,0.8037,1.0445]}

You , as the President of the USA , are about to address the world about what is happening , and what changes need to be made .","text":"Solar activity is on the decline, and the world is growing cold. Historical evidence indicates this cold period should only last about 500 years. You, as the President of the USA, are about to address the world about what is happening, and what changes need to be made. You have done most of this work before. The world hopes and expects much from you.\nThe question that concerns me the most is this: If a cold period lasts only 500 years, is it really worth it to take 500 years to turn this planet around?\nI have two thoughts. One is about the impact of the Earth\u2019s changing environment on the economy. The human population has always been dependent on a warmer climate, and that is going to change.\nOn the other hand, in a way, a planet of less people is more economical. Less people require less agriculture. Less manufacturing. Less infrastructure.\nI think that the economic aspects would weigh heavily in a human population reduction.\nThe impact on society is also important. We are no longer a people who can live in a world where we fight for anything, not even our basic human rights. We are already at war with one another, because of our differences in wealth and power. The human race will not be in favor of taking a stand on anything until we can all come to some form of agreement on what it is acceptable to do and what it is not. I think a climate catastrophe would lead us all in that direction.\nAnother thing that worries me is that there are no historical precedents for a population decrease. The history of most societies is full of examples of a stable increase in numbers. From the Stone Age through the middle ages, the US, etc.\nThe only people who have reduced their population is the Chinese. Their population has fallen by a quarter of a billion in a 100 years and their civilization has stagnated. They are now the richest society on the planet, but their economic system is a mess and their people are losing some of their most valuable values.\nThe British are another society that was at risk of collapse before the industrial revolution killed off the need for many of their trades. They only took 500 years to recover.","token_len":445,"entropy":[8.774,2.2567,4.5293,0.6773,3.1628,1.4117,1.8661,1.9312,3.4689,1.3011,5.2722,6.231,1.0246,10.8266,3.6975,2.3806,4.5433,5.674,3.4805,5.2526,5.1708,1.0114,2.4869,5.096,0.2636,0.7288,6.9042,6.487,2.4049,1.6785,5.2513,0.7971,0.1853,4.851,0.2096,2.2282,5.3523,0.1647,6.9241,1.2351,2.1354,2.0994,2.7787,2.2298,0.9672,3.0917,0.8225,1.8538,7.0874,2.9321,0.0167,0.3632,0.3373,1.2011,2.7615,2.1956,4.4069,6.0416,0.2463,1.9238,1.9363,2.7523,1.363,2.9965,3.1616,8.9296,3.2183,1.985,6.7096,3.5069,0.1362,0.5035,2.1513,7.6451,5.5637,2.6957,5.9438,1.3397,3.0184,0.0142,0.2911,2.714,0.2703,3.9452,4.7887,4.3211,1.7383,2.6329,3.134,0.4821,0.0469,0.2637,3.239,1.221,2.2908,2.1423,0.8746,1.7832,4.2343,8.1004,0.1515,0.432,5.0307,2.5421,3.6501,1.8455,0.4178,1.3721,2.6279,2.3635,4.6436,3.6625,1.1981,1.6294,0.5747,4.1424,1.1956,4.8432,0.5199,2.1942,4.296,16.95,7.4398,5.1956,5.366,3.0304,1.4901,1.1548,5.4076,1.9534,1.3322,7.2366,1.7751,1.9449,5.4861,0.4976,5.0557,0.1631,3.2725,6.1122,1.6693,1.4901,0.8161,2.7521,1.7374,4.4119,0.129,0.89,1.368,2.8149,4.2729,0.415,0.1422,0.1516,0.0526,5.0982,2.1911,4.629,0.4066,3.846,5.1686,3.7922,4.0998,7.2216,1.636,2.6671,5.8798,1.0151,6.8619,0.9842,5.9867,1.8603,7.3296,1.6197,2.2422,7.7055,1.6857,0.9986,5.049,0.4584,2.2266,2.8355,1.8844,1.3917,1.9493,3.6266,6.1467,5.6152,7.362,1.2161,2.7017,3.2665,6.5215,2.6982,5.4411,0.911,1.9956,2.2773,6.3869,1.5918,4.5342,1.2772,3.6337,3.0694,0.5728,3.0922,1.6949,5.485,0.0408,3.0211,4.989,2.9524,3.1123,3.3426,1.5043,1.2001,1.7414,1.6047,1.8617,8.5734,1.7768,6.8562,1.9942,4.2267,1.8058,2.1365,4.7338,2.5878,0.7269,0.2451,1.4768,1.0519,6.3221,3.9377,1.7267,0.8401,3.1607,0.0242,1.4364,4.6783,1.4595,2.0162,3.7251,2.2521,4.7491,0.8913,1.7648,0.257,2.8528,3.9563,1.222,3.3974,2.44,1.2473,4.7939,7.4486,0.045,5.9314,2.1417,3.2695,2.0034,3.8214,3.5476,0.9778,2.6487,3.8979,3.6148,2.4611,3.9673,5.7124,0.0118,1.0113,1.2114,1.7293,3.1989,0.8824,6.7748,0.6127,0.3684,2.9395,0.8443,0.5661,0.392,0.5705,0.3916,3.4226,1.0913,4.0267,4.851,5.3012,2.31,4.7161,2.2588,3.2331,4.9291,1.8155,0.0302,0.2803,0.4024,5.0659,2.2798,0.9867,3.7056,0.0108,0.489,1.4817,3.597,1.4927,2.9403,6.7178,2.8523,0.0037,0.697,1.8702,4.6954,4.0337,0.616,2.2089,4.905,0.3407,5.0225,2.4021,1.2553,4.9931,0.0149,3.3268,0.3691,2.2975,8.0641,6.086,0.4233,5.2876,1.064,6.4061,1.2573,5.8453,0.0165,2.5895,0.4213,5.3142,1.0744,0.5368,1.9006,7.5694,3.9638,7.6771,1.3519,4.2881,1.9766,3.8489,2.9644,0.6409,1.7098,6.6265,0.9226,0.9528,3.8267,1.1421,4.6087,0.9794,4.6847,0.6001,1.2908,3.2413,1.412,2.6259,3.6105,2.2648,0.1793,1.499,3.51,3.292,5.7648,1.6565,4.8065,3.2383,4.8617,0.994,4.6475,0.0019,0.7284,3.1491,1.4098,2.351,2.9158,4.5174,4.0795,0.9048,2.208,0.1508,1.5552,1.987,2.2124,3.688,3.1363,0.557,4.5087,1.7848,2.5632,1.9404,2.4019,0.512,4.4977,5.3669,0.2493,0.1298,3.2763,1.1239,6.4092,0.283,0.7198,1.8819,7.6285,3.0389,6.3634,5.4368,0.9067,4.3052,4.3231,3.7747,0.749,4.1113,3.8425,0.9649,4.4209,0.0788,9.9613,0.421,1.2578,6.2905,0.1947,5.1891,1.9144,0.9961,8.5185,0.5982,1.8792,5.8619,4.2893,6.536,0.2569,0.19,2.8958,1.6825]}

{"prompt":"The sole survivor of a night in a haunted cabin , where their friends were killed by some supernatural force\/monster , finally escapes and returns home . Police immediately charge the survivor with murder .","text":"The sole survivor of a night in a haunted cabin, where their friends were killed by some supernatural force\/monster, finally escapes and returns home. Police immediately charge the survivor with murder. The media soon report the case as a hoax and discredit it. Despite the evidence, the survivor is never charged, and after a long time, he gets divorced. Later the survivor gets divorced. One year later, he opens a wine business again and gets a new girlfriend.\nI was really interested to read this story, because in a year and a half I have not read such a well-written story that takes full advantage of psychological psychology. Some readers would think, how did the police and the media react as if the story was a hoax, but it's not a hoax. I believe that in reality that some people might do something like this, but they will never do that to their loved ones. However, in this story the monster did not kill her friends all at once. It gradually turned their deaths to kill them all. It also changed the victim's personality. I can't see a motive such as revenge. It's quite hard to see, but I saw a monster in this story. When I read the whole story I realized that the story is not one. The story has some different versions. My version had some different elements added to it, but I just made up the names to make it easier to read. I thought, that this idea of a story being in two parts is quite interesting.\nIn this article we are going to share with you how to setup Kubernetes for AWS Cloud Formation. We are going to also discuss all the setup steps of Kubernetes with Cloud Formations for AWS.\nYou got Cloud Formation and Kubernetes working perfectly fine in your new AWS cluster. You can see the setup in the following image\nAfter this setup, you can now deploy your services using AWS services. You can do that without having to go through some setup steps like deploying the server with terraform.\nYou only need to specify the AWS region with the API and IAM account. This is pretty easy and it has a huge advantage where it makes things very straightforward.","token_len":446,"entropy":[9.6561,4.0646,0.6596,2.1213,6.7662,3.83,2.9947,5.1462,4.2351,1.585,5.3741,5.6335,4.7245,1.8031,2.7785,1.4682,5.4631,4.8579,1.5245,8.9557,2.8442,0.6884,7.2338,3.8969,2.3789,3.7902,1.4981,1.2346,9.4354,6.1842,5.5305,1.4577,6.0909,1.1537,1.1598,1.4959,2.2225,7.2834,5.8404,4.1304,1.6223,2.895,1.1976,0.7937,2.3088,2.1308,7.0186,2.4795,1.1572,5.3381,1.1807,4.6056,0.9742,1.0277,4.53,1.6241,2.565,1.0558,2.7215,0.9251,5.1897,2.1747,2.9703,2.9417,1.3076,2.8411,4.5895,6.3357,0.9194,5.1308,3.6033,2.7875,3.5338,3.1448,2.8436,5.2099,2.8417,0.1595,0.5697,1.7135,7.1124,0.8676,7.6667,3.5987,5.2587,1.6242,3.7597,1.7291,2.3064,2.8555,0.4729,3.5054,8.1434,3.3755,4.5331,3.4657,1.9193,1.4659,2.2567,2.3346,1.645,2.5876,4.2974,2.7159,5.3564,3.0288,0.07,0.0332,2.0232,2.4336,3.2917,1.251,6.3014,0.5597,4.464,0.8309,0.7579,1.4283,4.1236,6.1443,6.4672,0.4887,0.0064,8.0443,5.1859,0.8709,5.642,3.4892,4.1597,2.7816,3.7716,5.1922,3.6526,2.2602,4.4462,3.9418,1.1423,1.2448,3.7222,5.9057,3.5,1.6582,0.979,0.5699,1.4924,0.545,1.9184,1.7107,2.5111,2.181,1.0312,4.3389,0.713,0.8445,2.8238,3.9838,1.1845,3.7173,5.3791,5.5193,6.4259,1.586,3.9389,5.0256,1.5804,1.3595,0.4438,1.4137,0.9881,2.6025,3.5899,1.2883,2.3139,2.9193,3.5228,3.3005,1.4261,0.1059,0.5153,5.2175,0.1287,2.7606,1.913,2.9604,2.0378,7.6769,4.5823,0.8741,2.4489,5.6891,3.1581,7.0618,1.4204,0.0335,1.0448,2.417,8.2394,4.5265,4.617,4.7121,6.1396,8.649,1.5247,1.6688,1.2165,2.5588,4.3367,3.7762,1.1584,4.8773,0.2565,2.7254,1.2522,3.214,3.888,1.0756,4.3808,3.2501,3.936,6.9229,0.1218,4.8069,2.2299,2.6517,1.4613,4.3063,3.4729,0.1533,2.6387,4.1284,1.8074,2.1021,4.8085,2.0146,3.4525,2.8892,2.3333,1.0151,1.3953,4.7335,1.4328,1.2134,1.33,5.1476,0.3715,1.4469,3.289,0.7758,1.7025,2.4524,1.4928,2.2106,4.5817,5.9666,1.8185,1.7122,3.6978,3.9599,5.8528,7.1852,1.3584,5.0902,3.9705,5.4178,2.8545,3.3191,3.7225,7.2895,1.4464,0.1905,1.2075,0.8315,1.5013,4.9768,5.8906,2.4217,0.9926,6.8435,4.3199,1.9869,0.614,3.0641,0.6328,0.7618,0.2299,2.0245,3.8905,2.0582,3.4781,2.6786,6.9747,1.7916,1.4752,3.0873,2.9108,4.9498,5.2753,1.551,1.2671,3.0834,2.3556,0.8454,1.9068,3.3128,2.3012,3.6295,3.022,2.3638,0.4324,0.0177,5.8362,2.2615,0.1504,3.3071,1.53,8.4113,11.2821,2.4144,0.025,0.0,3.1159,8.2113,3.5186,10.3571,0.8786,3.0215,1.5363,0.1027,0.0009,5.9069,2.3546,5.7373,0.589,6.1113,1.3604,3.5586,0.3035,0.0001,0.0031,0.0027,4.1205,4.8601,5.4725,2.1879,4.2748,1.9221,1.0653,1.3716,4.2418,7.8682,6.2541,1.9906,3.9016,2.1819,0.0004,0.0047,0.0052,5.8532,6.4426,3.6615,2.8809,1.576,4.0935,2.8095,4.0749,0.804,2.1004,2.4708,2.5032,1.8284,4.1777,2.996,1.056,1.5704,2.6446,4.372,4.4001,4.3295,1.6081,1.1708,0.7895,1.0793,3.2927,3.0537,1.6441,4.5559,2.8195,2.4377,4.4754,1.0242,2.0848,0.5409,3.3622,3.0376,4.4364,2.2146,0.2918,2.9731,0.2924,5.1511,3.464,0.6967,3.7597,2.9125,3.1313,5.2746,3.9359,8.754,1.4281,0.1111,1.9339,1.2533,2.319,6.0058,0.2797,0.3267,4.891,1.1027,3.2337,7.0117,4.6152,1.377,7.3481,4.6403,6.2927,7.1438,6.7786,1.2269,3.4347,0.936,4.6051,1.4085,3.482,2.2117,4.4401,1.9835,4.6516,2.8445,7.5251,3.0717,3.0066,3.269,3.8115,4.8431,0.4733]}

I am here to take you away from everything. I am going to put you inside a box and hand it over to someone that knows how to read. Your father will die and all that you have will go with him.

He sounded pretty crazy.'\nThe boy sighed and let out a long laugh. `` Look kid, if you get good enough you 'll find the answer. You 'll get to know what it feels like to be a ghost who has already been dead for a thousand years. Then you 'll find out why me and my dad are the only ones who are still alive. ''\nI smiled and shook my head. I didn't really know what it meant to be a dead ghost, but the boy seemed to think it had to be important. I suppose it could be so. I started to leave when I heard my parents knock on the door. '' Did you hear him?'I asked the boy. '' No'he said.'He only says things that mean something. '\nI got outside the door and ran as fast as I could. I found the door open and ran like that only it was an open building. I heard footsteps following me so I turned to see the boy standing before me. You remember the way I looked at him from up there? I suppose it was something like that. It was his weird smile that really looked at me the way he did. With a wink. But he was standing there just like he was watching. I thought it was like a big hall. It was dark so I just kept running. And I felt him follow close behind me.","token_len":447,"entropy":[7.012,2.1783,7.2646,3.5381,2.6499,4.9236,6.4514,5.8215,1.5327,1.7537,0.2023,3.8283,1.7719,4.9216,0.4748,1.6827,4.2335,1.1733,9.6587,8.1609,1.0973,4.464,7.3521,2.9539,10.8655,0.5492,1.0027,9.2833,0.5266,4.4416,2.095,0.2731,5.8631,2.3294,1.8958,3.803,1.7623,8.2125,4.72,0.0017,3.8788,7.0079,1.6383,3.5849,2.1026,11.321,0.0064,0.6592,0.1202,0.7104,3.1965,2.1318,4.3279,3.0602,6.7134,4.0265,8.3946,2.3111,3.3723,2.5924,1.8845,3.2344,0.4162,3.1655,0.4304,1.4088,4.5406,4.4862,0.9309,0.3917,5.927,1.4355,5.645,1.2673,3.9081,3.512,8.8784,5.893,4.7248,3.1303,0.6631,1.8719,4.1104,0.9486,5.7614,1.5293,2.4791,2.9714,3.7146,0.772,3.4451,1.6065,3.7469,0.9687,6.0141,1.4786,1.4688,1.3675,2.7175,0.0772,4.0435,0.4256,5.3781,1.8451,2.6767,1.4942,7.0791,2.0924,0.7772,0.2238,4.3442,3.6891,2.5549,1.4126,0.0725,4.8631,1.3122,5.9405,3.5056,1.9508,4.6783,3.3488,4.4965,2.6051,2.3137,1.3003,2.8019,3.1864,4.4161,2.0145,0.523,4.1827,3.3398,0.3676,2.8917,0.839,0.0156,5.7018,7.115,0.9697,3.4792,4.5955,3.6492,2.6603,0.695,0.4389,2.0267,2.4181,3.2333,5.1541,8.9387,6.1146,3.8891,7.6301,2.5467,3.1552,2.1901,1.3558,0.838,3.7931,3.2693,2.7849,1.0569,0.0117,0.6568,1.9172,6.7586,5.2262,4.9521,4.4242,1.1523,2.7889,3.2554,6.0168,1.4619,5.4195,0.4654,0.1265,2.0731,2.635,0.2946,0.3312,4.8097,3.7647,0.4814,3.1627,0.3982,2.5479,0.7719,0.009,1.8318,3.9101,0.0548,3.8423,3.7146,5.2183,1.3461,2.1439,2.3445,0.0123,3.2583,2.0185,3.0283,2.544,2.129,5.1057,0.0069,0.3307,1.1349,2.1696,4.3969,5.5174,2.3742,5.4334,1.9272,3.1656,0.6743,1.715,2.2037,0.1278,0.4357,5.0336,0.8489,1.1246,0.0134,3.2041,0.8387,3.3937,7.0601,0.5465,1.4917,4.4542,1.6505,3.5284,1.2732,0.4821,1.0912,2.8223,2.7123,0.2044,0.5065,2.7342,0.508,1.473,4.2721,1.5592,4.0578,0.3636,0.0266,0.3292,3.0077,3.0641,0.0063,3.2456,1.588,0.4951,3.5635,2.0509,1.2271,0.7335,1.0196,4.1296,2.3343,1.6726,0.747,3.5486,3.0425,3.4418,0.8157,2.4316,1.4357,3.7795,1.8337,0.5765,7.118,0.6578,2.0935,6.0526,1.622,3.234,0.6556,4.7071,0.7144,1.8314,4.8049,0.9777,4.5542,4.9182,1.5004,1.1815,4.0374,4.1445,7.7144,0.8969,0.2392,0.096,0.3329,3.8591,4.5162,0.8004,1.7331,3.7997,3.4094,5.2709,2.3663,3.0677,0.97,0.568,1.7845,1.5617,6.5185,4.2169,1.8747,4.2863,3.5642,6.5483,5.782,4.3508,1.423,4.1005,1.3241,1.5086,3.7982,5.2018,1.456,4.0824,7.4549,3.3026,1.3344,1.0087,3.3143,5.183,0.2562,0.0281,0.0862,0.0568,1.0642,0.7773,4.0808,1.6199,2.7245,2.0578,0.9918,4.4024,5.6947,4.4443,7.1028,6.9473,1.2972,4.7929,2.3661,8.7747,0.4934,0.8061,3.6948,3.0845,8.1124,0.2111,5.4533,0.1786,3.2255,2.3933,0.5785,1.5813,1.8949,2.2898,3.5108,0.407,0.3822,7.0005,4.858,2.2392,3.7024,1.8001,1.8242,0.7654,0.6097,4.6796,6.8784,2.3596,1.2671,1.5982,6.4067,2.1978,0.8001,4.7716,2.0311,0.8429,0.6391,3.0518,0.7548,4.5488,7.4018,3.6599,1.6964,4.5225,6.0986,3.4267,0.128,3.6449,1.1526,1.2811,1.1367,0.9425,6.5589,1.3938,3.6774,3.1813,4.5574,2.1683,1.8916,5.2385,1.6364,5.0938,1.6103,2.8222,1.6186,5.8022,3.471,1.5006,2.8544,2.5793,0.4509,3.936,1.906,3.9142,8.7271,1.8396,2.2917,0.6634,3.0378,3.7,0.3839,3.6709,3.1632,1.6228,0.8144,3.5376,1.7465,3.9793,3.9342,6.9525,7.6178,0.6773,0.2165,0.6187]}
{"prompt":"You just died . God escorts you to a door , telling you that this is your own personal heaven . What 's behind your door ?","text":"You just died. God escorts you to a door, telling you that this is your own personal heaven. What's behind your door? Are You living in it? If the answer is yes, then I would go to hell as\nYour comments are so accurate. Not one but two people have recently said to me the exact same thing. What happens if someone leaves their God and turns to Islam? Or turns, for whatever reason, to a non-Christian religion (Buddhism, or any of the Abrahamic faiths, or even pagan religions). For example, do we just put them into the same pit that Sinners go? This issue is being explored in the Bible. The answer on the pit or no pit will probably come out in scripture very soon.\nAnd as we think of our own lives and our own beliefs of ourselves at the end of our lives - do we think of ourselves as in the heaven or in the hell? If I say I live in heaven, can that be true? Do I deserve heaven? Do I have the good habits that I have always known are necessary for heaven? I think I may be the wrong here. We can be in the pit without believing in Christ as our savior. We can go to heaven without doing good after death. We can make the eternal choices we make right right up to judgement day and still go to hell. The Bible does not say that every person in hell will be condemned on the day of judgement. But many people will be in it and many people will go to heaven without having known Christ as their Savior.\nAnd you know what? I believe that it is ok to give something to one person and let that person live a sinful lifestyle and see the evil they have done in the lives of innocent people, and to live without the knowledge of salvation. I believe that it is ok to live a sinful lifestyle and to be born into a church family without the knowledge of salvation. I accept that this is what Jesus told to people. But I cannot accept that a man or a woman who has been convicted of a spiritual problem can be rescued without knowing Jesus the Savior. Maybe you think I am crazy. But I really think I am.","token_len":447,"entropy":[5.6202,8.3188,1.4165,6.3777,13.6632,0.0774,0.6888,1.2381,3.1517,6.6794,1.8006,6.7764,0.0812,1.8743,4.1857,0.7617,1.5178,5.2652,3.7309,5.668,0.9084,4.4694,2.6071,6.2479,3.0336,1.9322,0.7506,4.529,8.0074,6.0605,1.0621,4.1027,0.5979,4.2287,4.9903,2.477,0.2389,0.7949,0.1459,0.9747,3.0385,4.2914,4.2965,2.0088,1.626,4.6352,8.6319,13.5912,8.9696,1.5084,5.365,8.1375,2.0333,5.8608,4.0185,3.8803,0.7241,1.9067,1.1997,7.8619,2.7681,3.2825,0.1586,4.926,2.835,0.255,0.1103,0.7442,4.729,5.1621,1.9316,3.5038,5.8814,2.9212,6.7673,2.6105,5.3536,1.6468,5.8322,0.7971,4.091,6.4226,5.6584,2.7486,4.4295,0.2119,0.1261,0.1911,3.4638,3.7185,0.0893,2.4952,0.5089,4.5547,6.209,0.8932,0.6417,0.0441,1.0066,3.935,3.1596,2.5174,0.5052,7.8866,0.0141,1.0938,2.3722,2.327,2.439,6.0111,2.323,2.9566,5.4981,1.5963,0.2584,4.7122,4.1069,5.2586,6.2187,3.448,2.6924,2.0852,2.0764,7.0065,3.4748,11.3321,0.6445,4.2932,3.0818,4.7435,7.0031,1.0132,5.0552,4.215,1.7089,1.9953,4.2349,1.5584,3.0743,3.3449,7.4659,0.8621,9.818,6.5928,6.232,0.9274,4.5567,3.7496,2.5223,3.2458,1.2669,6.5109,5.8794,0.2462,0.5684,2.0705,4.2146,4.1894,3.5721,6.5162,2.011,3.6546,1.5888,2.4291,1.835,1.5811,0.9703,3.6892,6.2919,3.5239,6.7295,1.3154,2.2263,0.0536,1.6901,0.936,5.2551,4.617,0.3736,3.5013,0.7383,2.0441,0.5553,4.9782,1.7815,4.9274,1.4785,1.5467,0.3004,0.514,0.4937,2.9874,3.3832,2.9679,2.3783,3.4074,0.2239,2.5707,0.6521,4.357,4.0618,0.8469,2.5375,0.7025,3.5149,0.2472,6.4249,3.4447,1.988,2.4896,0.0802,2.3142,1.676,6.9163,8.7661,2.3666,1.6652,1.5631,4.8059,4.3832,4.8728,3.6692,0.8116,1.7942,0.3965,2.9995,3.0058,2.567,4.1085,1.2307,3.7597,4.9699,7.9094,0.6032,4.5631,3.1713,3.3629,2.7755,1.1302,4.1591,5.4778,5.569,0.9011,4.8912,3.7307,2.1228,2.8923,0.6688,2.1661,0.6988,4.2945,1.0514,2.1578,0.4992,5.2205,4.9389,7.071,3.6656,0.7247,1.3136,0.246,4.997,2.3065,7.2289,5.7927,1.9972,2.5941,5.3391,6.6002,4.4635,0.707,10.6791,0.7084,2.8008,5.1016,4.3191,0.7086,1.0122,0.8477,3.6161,2.9191,2.709,0.2743,1.3253,1.3071,5.2373,1.2373,2.9091,2.9527,2.1766,1.1353,5.2019,5.9128,1.2313,1.0857,0.6144,1.3512,0.7724,2.8505,4.2599,1.2968,1.6169,1.0736,2.817,3.8007,2.0823,4.261,1.5765,0.1916,3.1335,0.8713,1.7323,3.1042,3.2348,6.668,1.7447,1.947,0.7429,1.6449,0.3194,1.6586,2.7619,4.0969,2.594,1.0196,0.9715,1.4269,3.4829,1.312,3.9569,0.629,5.5709,0.556,5.0897,6.0155,1.552,4.1606,2.8856,1.8565,4.5431,2.9997,0.7197,3.4094,3.363,5.0913,4.6779,2.546,5.7644,2.1242,5.9967,4.4785,1.995,0.469,2.9068,1.2119,4.7956,0.2012,7.8477,0.3989,3.226,2.232,2.6622,3.1575,5.4992,2.9545,2.9225,0.7201,6.4549,0.5371,1.7358,0.7961,0.5171,1.5228,0.0757,0.6959,0.3016,3.6975,1.8639,1.4629,0.7807,0.6328,2.8827,2.4007,5.1898,1.5551,1.0918,7.805,5.7845,4.2782,2.1985,0.2334,0.2195,0.6914,0.2808,0.8921,7.2127,0.849,3.7095,0.4149,3.1254,3.0838,3.5452,7.64,4.2307,1.7925,2.6783,1.0146,5.0204,1.4512,0.7046,4.5931,3.5666,3.1366,1.0668,0.0362,1.6158,2.2295,1.9997,5.413,0.3017,1.8809,8.9816,7.0085,2.5462,1.7005,7.3221,3.7757,2.033,3.0154,5.6374,2.2668,0.5229,6.8413,3.3689,3.5894,1.6642,0.8801,2.5908,1.442,2.1201,1.1402,4.759,2.2273,2.6526,0.5061,1.0429]}

Everyone wasted their prayer without knowing while they were younger, but you never prayed until you were in your twenties. You pray for something noticeable. I remember it clearly. I was about twenty years old.\nI was thinking that this might be the answer for me as well. I have a lot of faith in God and pray a lot, but I never get any real answer to any of those random prayers. I am not sure if the reason for this might be because I am constantly doing my homework trying to find things that God doesn\u2019t want me to do, but I don\u2019t have faith that my prayers are of God\u2019s heart, and if there is a God, He always wants to please us. Also my prayers usually are answered \u201cwith the Lord\u201d, which for me is the devil, but I can\u2019t help but feel like my God has some answers to all my prayers.\nI was just trying to be optimistic, maybe someone else will have better information. My belief in God has changed over time, but for the past several years, I\u2019ve been praying for a baby, in spite of our difficulties. I\u2019m now thinking that maybe I was really waiting for the other shoe to drop. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being dramatic, but it is an interesting thought and makes me a little nervous.\nJust my 2 cents to add to this. In May, I started a job (I was laid off from a job three months earlier, but I had made a deal with the employer that I would work at their company for three more months) and for about a couple of weeks, I prayed every day, and with increasing intensity, that I would find another job. I finally quit my job four days before my new job\u2019s start, only to be told I could not take the job without being out of work for eight weeks before starting the new job. And to find I had been unemployed since April. I\u2019m just guessing, but do you think I did something wrong? Any advice on dealing with such a situation?","token_len":448,"entropy":[9.6038,1.7336,1.7215,3.0063,8.5157,6.4654,6.1421,5.9368,4.0431,9.368,1.7087,6.1673,1.9088,6.7163,14.8433,1.8656,4.9536,6.917,3.3161,9.8872,2.1611,0.6279,9.5896,1.7514,3.4297,4.4298,3.3465,7.382,3.7986,0.449,0.3057,3.6927,0.9458,2.0244,0.8614,2.7857,3.9876,1.8423,4.3791,12.5886,3.0031,4.5106,4.19,4.8995,6.5827,1.5605,1.5137,2.5207,4.4473,3.1776,2.235,0.0394,1.8009,2.3949,5.4143,2.1674,5.3302,2.76,3.2201,3.2206,0.4617,1.5092,4.5763,2.6676,1.2916,3.8731,1.4016,0.5364,1.0968,4.5985,1.9985,3.046,0.1914,3.6019,0.895,0.6861,1.6414,4.9344,4.2949,0.0427,2.0442,0.5654,0.8392,3.0405,4.4511,4.4997,3.628,4.6849,2.1652,3.7707,0.5655,2.0428,10.859,1.4283,0.701,1.1324,3.259,2.1943,1.579,1.1926,3.3761,4.0901,2.0534,1.094,5.5538,0.2146,0.9623,0.516,1.1255,6.6762,5.3407,3.2216,3.2067,7.6082,0.0589,2.0231,3.9721,0.9766,4.909,2.1082,18.3984,6.7276,3.8112,2.3082,0.3709,0.0404,0.5816,1.1311,1.9215,0.9488,3.1209,4.1886,0.1966,0.053,2.7998,4.0677,1.5335,3.577,1.1218,1.683,5.7738,2.5117,4.5591,0.025,2.7404,8.6244,2.6897,1.6085,3.0909,4.1954,0.6128,1.6524,2.199,1.5581,5.7782,5.3761,2.0811,1.147,6.1417,4.1662,0.6058,6.7451,5.38,3.0758,5.1617,3.0133,4.7709,11.9594,5.163,6.4135,2.3995,6.688,1.5097,7.9558,2.5798,2.3139,6.3569,0.4484,1.0361,2.4297,7.0659,2.2793,1.7969,1.0757,3.3169,3.9779,0.1412,0.0053,4.7063,0.974,2.1598,2.2974,3.5477,4.3395,3.082,3.5966,4.5156,1.7748,2.4787,2.3388,0.4321,0.4299,1.0063,1.3201,3.1184,4.1029,3.1574,0.0289,3.3404,5.2312,2.0538,4.8721,6.2208,2.1987,2.3533,3.6612,3.2683,4.1674,1.6736,4.1923,5.3189,1.3887,0.6465,2.8339,2.6513,2.4969,0.6556,0.8999,0.9743,4.4109,1.2793,3.987,3.3588,0.192,1.5335,0.37,8.3029,0.2111,1.3209,0.6138,1.7913,1.3454,2.7861,6.1163,2.2687,5.4643,5.0154,0.0358,6.3996,6.3704,0.6755,0.929,4.7158,0.0532,1.1211,4.7328,3.8741,1.3566,1.9815,1.6803,4.0344,5.1568,6.0802,0.2423,2.2723,5.8409,7.4642,0.0162,0.0197,0.9564,1.2826,2.7116,0.2364,0.0868,0.0206,0.7388,1.6408,1.2526,3.4721,0.0359,0.7178,4.3627,9.1994,1.3701,0.8548,2.7002,1.9515,4.6294,2.9386,1.4887,3.248,4.7624,0.1697,4.2529,0.757,2.2374,0.4873,1.1868,5.5398,5.4858,4.5498,0.9994,4.9097,5.4377,1.5557,1.6428,1.9381,5.2213,6.4026,1.8473,0.8005,3.3644,2.1813,6.2126,5.7589,2.5374,2.9053,5.7391,0.0144,1.7969,1.8918,2.0252,6.8054,0.9885,2.8024,2.1374,1.9553,1.2629,3.5611,5.6368,1.7847,4.2259,0.3337,1.5672,2.6794,2.3487,0.5062,0.3224,2.415,2.9269,4.1563,2.0945,1.3252,2.7837,2.3499,0.7459,3.0625,0.6171,4.9957,3.9629,1.1187,5.3802,0.5343,0.9517,1.9782,0.3451,3.0002,3.129,0.6367,2.5984,2.1508,5.7933,7.5399,2.8939,0.8105,5.1438,0.9367,0.5875,2.7493,4.907,0.2255,0.5686,1.1355,5.1616,6.4157,1.0769,0.0671,5.5202,1.6186,1.5317,2.0423,3.9761,0.7705,10.4473,0.6669,2.8861,3.1777,1.1927,5.8956,0.4898,1.9872,0.9513,2.4596,2.8891,1.2195,3.8589,2.1139,0.575,4.2963,3.7733,6.7989,0.3634,0.7596,0.6205,5.907,1.2341,4.8815,4.9604,2.125,0.8077,0.3951,0.419,4.7713,5.2142,6.2279,6.971,2.3011,2.1846,4.1522,4.2429,3.2411,1.8249,1.2354,4.7679,0.0445,0.5619,3.4996,6.2195,1.8656,0.6347,7.2205,1.286,1.5937,0.9404,3.4715,1.7513,1.5131,0.673,5.4432,3.1089,2.4696,5.8807,0.0066,5.1741,0.9068,1.0936,0.449]}
{"prompt":"Faster than Light travel has existed for centuries , this has spawned many folk laws , tall tales and down right horror stories about things that happen while in FTL .","text":"Faster than Light travel has existed for centuries, this has spawned many folk laws, tall tales and down right horror stories about things that happen while in FTL. One of the most common theories is that if you are travelling faster than the speed of light you start to see past the present moment.\nBut how does you remember past events? How does you know what has actually happened, or even what are your past memories? There is a good answer to this question found in quantum physics, The wave function of a particle or system will always be changing. The simplest way to see this is if you try to count the electrons in a hydrogen atom for example, you will always get a different result according to where you are measuring from.\nBut the real question is if the wave function can actually be altered during a time travel experience? Many physicists thought that this was impossible until recently in 1992 when two experimental physicists published a paper showing that the wave function can be altered during a time travel experience. The experiment showed that you can change what was in the past from what it was when you left, this can also change the future, this can be seen in this little sketch by John Carrette of a simple clock.\nIn this experiment the two physicists from University of Exeter, Dr Stuart Macquarrie and Dr Simon Wilton, were working on a project called The Quantum Clock. What they were trying to achieve was to be able to measure both the position and the momentum of an electron in the quantum world with absolute accuracy as the particles had to be moved at precise positions and time delays needed to be measured accurately. The idea is to use this as a clock.\nThe experiment was a success and in 1992 in the review \" Nature \" explained the work they had achieved. The experiment consisted of two particles which were moving at speed v relative to each other. The relative motion between these particles was changed to move the particles at any relative velocity between zero and the speed of light. The speed of this relative motion is called the Mach velocity, its important to keep in mind that the Mach velocity is not the same as velocity. The Mach velocity is simply the limit of the relative velocity as you move to the speed of light.","token_len":448,"entropy":[8.7327,2.5658,7.5131,7.6913,5.4507,6.7365,1.1912,2.5987,1.1836,5.9026,4.0478,6.3344,2.4702,9.4039,9.2802,1.7908,11.4645,0.4544,1.1329,8.7435,6.2592,5.2883,1.9021,3.7251,4.9904,1.036,2.6486,4.5759,3.6273,8.6852,1.6346,0.4724,5.0323,0.5744,0.5767,1.057,1.818,4.4811,0.7801,0.1962,4.2194,0.7271,2.2748,2.9617,3.3949,0.2314,3.766,0.3191,0.2708,0.056,2.4641,6.8341,0.9827,3.4804,7.4098,0.7804,8.379,4.6958,1.5404,2.5144,8.9275,3.7199,1.4789,6.4922,6.2782,5.0525,1.2304,0.9372,3.1401,1.2218,2.3593,2.2023,1.6949,4.2626,5.3013,0.0544,2.9443,2.6291,3.5867,0.9574,6.5288,3.075,3.0068,0.7686,1.1536,4.2234,1.5316,1.1261,3.8926,3.2351,0.7674,0.9644,0.3866,7.7298,0.3555,7.6532,1.2408,1.2108,6.3088,8.2487,0.7592,1.3771,2.3384,1.7108,4.2342,4.1684,5.7693,2.6788,0.8604,5.582,1.5802,2.4208,4.0646,1.2235,0.2512,4.2687,0.8395,0.1639,4.9877,0.6058,5.0717,0.4533,6.9863,0.823,6.0924,1.033,0.8953,7.1102,0.1527,5.7348,2.7695,1.622,1.7772,0.6233,3.437,1.5535,1.4879,2.7154,1.4614,8.1951,0.0045,4.5173,0.9372,1.3035,5.7141,4.9438,0.4037,1.4933,3.0494,3.1861,3.3652,1.3389,0.4028,3.5857,2.6207,2.3934,0.1161,3.6245,3.1988,1.1497,3.5947,5.0954,1.7511,3.001,4.41,4.2801,2.0922,5.5529,3.4061,7.5163,1.1731,2.1339,1.0853,1.2804,3.5853,2.5107,4.9256,9.0253,1.2187,5.236,5.766,0.9432,4.5145,0.9841,0.2433,3.4438,0.3207,1.483,1.1494,0.0957,1.3036,1.0603,0.9853,1.0414,1.2717,1.7226,0.1285,0.1638,0.4785,2.0661,3.8805,2.6321,0.1376,4.652,0.7445,1.2541,5.0909,5.0437,3.0964,1.4444,0.3968,4.5241,1.1824,4.3792,1.2505,3.9569,0.3007,5.2527,4.1561,4.8142,3.1594,3.6783,2.1693,1.359,3.0999,2.749,3.3808,1.3739,2.5499,2.0514,0.7826,4.6779,6.3659,6.8107,2.7139,4.8016,6.5634,9.6202,2.5918,5.3166,4.3026,6.7566,1.6012,0.6361,3.0885,1.5388,4.1561,2.2957,3.9139,1.249,5.5339,4.2845,0.4621,4.2162,0.0021,2.9499,4.5788,6.5754,5.1107,5.3353,3.1342,0.0062,0.5327,1.0212,4.9808,6.3895,3.8342,1.333,3.2236,3.5188,0.7479,0.6111,4.566,1.4277,3.3179,3.0235,4.1314,0.8765,4.9178,0.5285,3.2194,2.2317,0.039,3.5225,0.2659,0.4302,5.3432,0.0195,0.0128,2.5703,5.6703,0.6606,6.2899,1.0731,2.3385,4.2878,0.1466,3.2768,1.2364,1.6335,1.3089,3.6484,1.9759,4.4767,6.249,2.4903,5.2422,3.4272,5.0257,5.5209,1.1377,1.7695,3.2653,2.9448,6.0144,5.953,3.1626,3.8761,7.7148,6.6371,0.2381,1.8907,3.8372,7.4042,0.3703,2.1066,3.2166,2.6768,1.2457,2.8527,2.0278,4.2991,0.4504,5.9483,3.7074,1.0932,1.2761,2.9985,0.9819,3.3127,3.204,1.2577,3.2134,3.3002,5.748,1.3031,10.7193,4.1729,10.4061,2.326,7.4887,1.8968,4.1624,4.0034,1.4477,4.3875,0.7597,1.803,3.8681,5.4583,0.046,2.2847,5.5864,3.5984,0.8193,1.7134,0.7003,5.1289,8.5898,8.9091,0.0156,0.6792,0.0079,1.1128,1.0917,8.3503,2.844,4.7858,2.8118,0.6709,0.8938,5.3288,2.6276,4.0517,1.4984,1.8649,2.1358,5.7761,5.5914,1.6645,3.983,4.8231,0.1678,2.1259,1.4155,0.4004,0.0215,0.4721,1.2593,2.8672,0.3904,7.0385,4.1085,0.649,2.3975,1.9656,0.3529,7.3401,7.8285,2.1983,5.6908,6.6682,1.6971,4.1999,0.172,0.0037,0.4886,1.5396,5.2284,0.541,0.7439,2.5077,1.7208,1.0303,0.5875,5.7509,2.4358,1.6087,5.9682,0.1851,0.7276,3.5227,0.6331,8.1874,0.8781,0.499,3.6952,1.759,5.146,3.3195,0.483,5.3067,1.5349,1.8268,0.1636,0.0243,0.4272]}
{"prompt":"Write a story that is perfectly normal , until the last line .","text":"Write a story that is perfectly normal, until the last line. Then do a final rewrite. The writer could go a bit too far in the last rewrite, but if he or she is happy with them, they can be published.\nSo, in essence, a \" bestseller \" is a book that people will tell you about over and over again, in various forms of conversation.\nNow, why should an author feel any pressure to deliver an \" instant \" bestseller? First, because the industry wants authors to write bestsellers, but if you don't write the bestselling genre or the bestselling book at the pace that the industry demands, how can you survive? How can you feed your family and support yourself. And more critically, what purpose would such a book serve, if it wasn't to satisfy the desires of the market. A book that sells a million copies - if your next book isn't that awesome a seller, it becomes a chore to explain your success. The reader won't understand. So you spend years writing a novel just to satisfy the needs and curiosity of the readers, so later their admiration would come back to you.\nMost people are going through the same struggles, they feel the pressure to conform. To write something that suits the desires of the industry or the audience, but not the writer. If you want to write one of the best books of any given year, you are going to have to change your writing voice. Which is fine - there's nothing wrong with taking risks and taking a chance on something different. But I would suggest that the risks you take should be calculated, and the risks should be the result of your understanding of the goals you set. And, again, there is no wrong answer.\nThis, after all, is the reason most successful authors and stories remain in obscurity. The reader has no idea they are worth something, and the writer doesn't know that an audience exists. The writer doesn't know it, because the publisher told them to do it. The author didn't ask the publisher to do so, so why should the author ask? I mean, a publishing house should be telling us how to write. Not the other way around, I think...","token_len":448,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0792,2.6948,8.2948,5.6145,1.9875,7.5902,2.486,4.331,4.1002,1.6356,3.3084,4.8669,1.8553,5.4568,4.8348,1.1438,3.5315,4.8841,4.8283,3.8503,4.2678,2.8249,4.603,0.2533,2.3194,3.1068,3.5839,7.3487,1.1719,1.1919,3.0787,2.1203,2.3226,0.0025,2.3446,4.2873,0.4124,6.087,0.4997,1.6501,1.5191,4.4721,5.8988,0.9131,1.1267,8.1778,1.3783,3.5235,4.9294,0.1222,3.6205,3.7647,13.2472,3.0999,1.0992,0.7637,0.9592,2.6258,0.5572,5.1604,2.7807,5.5949,0.46,1.8701,5.5845,0.4704,0.0015,0.6814,1.6259,3.7239,4.7998,2.2778,4.2121,5.6469,0.9696,2.5183,4.3652,0.3611,5.4198,2.6035,4.805,0.4875,5.1153,3.1384,2.7693,0.302,5.6802,2.7804,2.6043,9.755,1.5184,4.0057,0.1608,1.1978,4.8033,0.6257,1.9343,2.2192,6.9322,4.0931,5.3096,0.1638,3.1163,4.2723,0.1495,0.0046,1.8073,3.5875,4.5136,1.4391,2.109,0.0012,2.4634,3.248,5.395,7.1261,4.4355,2.0918,2.288,1.5398,4.6221,1.3686,7.7055,1.3512,2.1852,0.8306,1.7894,0.2302,5.3466,1.1414,0.3011,6.6472,1.0634,5.4048,0.5889,0.2108,8.3965,1.4931,5.4324,1.3347,4.9512,1.9263,5.3532,2.6301,4.5983,6.3645,0.0862,2.91,7.4827,3.1725,4.5751,0.5514,0.707,0.109,3.2472,1.4498,0.7128,3.5265,0.0005,4.4068,5.1242,1.3084,5.2668,0.0777,1.3549,3.661,4.5448,4.5298,1.5687,0.9094,3.886,3.9457,2.3612,0.1341,7.0219,3.5667,4.4111,6.2284,0.7793,4.2656,0.0003,4.7447,6.0449,6.1711,4.8133,0.9653,2.1428,7.1534,1.2325,7.6652,1.4137,6.2521,3.7328,3.8627,1.8744,3.7095,4.6476,4.0515,0.0011,2.8618,2.8707,3.8447,3.3227,6.3742,4.2611,2.759,2.1966,3.0577,5.717,0.2297,3.4345,0.5923,3.912,4.2978,5.873,0.0676,0.3774,2.5233,1.8316,3.9105,8.5143,8.1989,7.0964,5.7951,4.3364,2.4905,1.0658,0.5438,0.6121,1.0668,6.0189,2.3378,2.85,4.8673,2.8072,1.8598,0.1647,5.3051,2.0543,4.2466,4.2006,2.7841,1.8769,0.8367,7.4176,2.4732,5.1311,2.9265,3.0287,0.7481,6.6429,1.7887,4.537,0.145,0.4013,5.229,3.7824,0.8979,2.6636,1.1078,3.4885,2.9945,1.8605,4.8314,1.7825,3.4595,0.7409,2.573,0.469,1.5877,5.1061,1.7635,1.2814,0.5819,1.8217,1.1327,5.47,5.6245,0.5731,0.1745,1.1122,3.6954,0.9297,0.0042,0.5714,0.0735,4.419,0.8173,2.805,9.3957,0.9844,6.3625,1.0666,3.9037,3.1068,4.1004,2.5985,2.2061,0.269,0.0598,5.5307,3.7277,2.0447,3.3491,3.012,2.1084,2.4107,1.4672,5.6684,0.5924,0.6217,4.2361,3.1502,2.7449,0.7337,2.8693,7.7785,3.1997,0.6974,3.5394,0.4952,5.0667,2.6275,1.4902,2.8006,3.9168,2.0109,0.3384,4.7242,4.2904,0.0801,1.5406,6.2373,0.7892,0.5814,8.5084,1.8948,2.6465,1.5047,3.1242,3.6745,4.0743,0.0416,3.7018,1.5758,0.8548,3.6556,3.2663,1.3959,1.1656,3.89,4.4253,4.5907,0.2389,0.0802,0.1102,1.3132,3.4811,4.9524,3.5064,1.3107,4.4746,7.4785,5.9699,2.3185,3.876,0.7329,2.5715,5.4254,2.8659,1.3457,0.7994,6.0039,0.8086,5.8887,4.9905,1.4784,1.1499,2.1342,2.1144,2.7827,0.0011,1.3693,2.6468,5.8452,3.8876,4.9441,1.0416,2.3046,1.9677,2.4356,0.0005,0.5018,4.4161,4.0245,2.2835,1.6072,4.057,6.1945,0.7985,1.9594,2.797,0.7879,0.5399,1.2711,2.6706,3.5524,0.0004,5.1451,2.8622,1.1892,0.5559,1.2569,6.5599,1.0031,3.5513,4.0612,1.8459,1.4679,2.9718,4.8807,2.1767,5.0327,3.4966,0.1008,4.3886,5.7275,1.182,3.9,1.8006,4.9428,5.0043,2.2998,0.9228,1.5958,2.5303,4.8346,3.4686,4.4316,0.0012,0.0554,1.9323,4.0287,1.9072,6.2616]}

The business mogul manipulates his son by putting him in the right situations and by influencing his environment and surroundings.\nThe Clone is written at a very high, very fast pace. The passage of events is very fluid and easy to read by. From beginning to end, this novel is quick and fast paced. I found myself reading this novel at a great pace. The narrative is good ; it is written well.\nI love this novel. The author is truly an amazing writer. She is an author that I highly recommend. The Clone is a very entertaining, well written, fast paced novel. She is an author who I would read again and again.\nThis short story features Clonex, who has the power to make anything she wishes real - but she can't control other people. Every time someone tries to take advantage of her power, she runs away. One day, Clonex meets a boy who is trying his best to be like her clone. He wants to be like his clone. He wants to be a hero. He wants to protect others. The boy decides to help him become what he wants to be. The boy begins to teach Clonex how to use her powers correctly. The boy finds that Clonex has a great deal of power over his behavior. The power of the boy and Clonex's is great - but they can use their powers for a good or for evil. How they use their powers is up to them.\nGrowth is one reason the boys and girl twins are not in this story. They grow up. They leave town. They find their own place in life.

{"prompt":"The inner workings of a serial killer portrayed in the style of the movie Inside Out .","text":"The inner workings of a serial killer portrayed in the style of the movie Inside Out. He is known as the \"Big Monster\" by local police. He often attacks children on the playground, and in this case he goes after a young girl at her school. The story is meant to introduce the reader to the character of the monster: a murderous creature with the heart of an angel whose mission in life is to kill children, who is in need of redemption. The novel's theme is a classic revenge story, with some twists that include a twist at the very end showing that the monster was actually trying to save his children from his cruelty while he was on the inside, using his angelic angelic nature to do it. The plot starts when an old man, who works as a janitor and takes care of two daughters, is brutally stabbed in the stomach when he is on the street. He dies as he is trying to help a boy out of his car, and it is then shown that the old man was actually working as a janitor so he could find a way to take care of the children. The story is told from the point of view of another detective, Tom, and he starts looking for the murderer who came to kill the old man. He finds out that he was actually in a mental institution and that he had been mistreated by his guards. A new detective enters the story, Alex, who turns out to be the man who hit the old man from the beginning, who was trying to save him himself, even though no one believed him. When Alex is accused of his murder, he tries to prove his innocence, but there is always a suspect that the police are still looking for until one night he meets the monster, who was in the mental institution and who has a history of violence against people. They spend the night together, and when the monster wakes up he kills Alex. The end of the story shows that the monster was trying to save Alex before he killed him, and that was the only reason that he could have saved the life of the little girl also hit in the story. A classic novel that is part of the genre of the detective novel and that is meant to be read for young adults.","token_len":449,"entropy":[9.3419,2.6419,0.1064,2.5336,7.0273,1.4056,11.4874,0.6862,1.2533,11.7181,0.1924,2.0228,3.5067,9.0625,1.3425,1.3888,4.4937,2.0257,4.6626,1.5028,1.3687,1.3991,4.7791,5.6275,1.0008,3.0945,5.7954,2.966,1.9254,1.736,5.0624,4.5589,3.5628,4.0707,0.6666,3.4207,1.4495,1.9608,3.702,3.7121,1.0825,1.931,6.5795,1.5874,1.8324,2.5546,0.6313,3.9766,3.0902,1.6827,0.4735,2.5027,3.5107,1.8266,7.5807,0.0947,5.4417,0.9659,2.1976,0.0999,0.6945,3.3915,1.8974,1.4133,2.6532,4.9772,2.6441,6.6127,5.5229,2.6667,2.7306,6.6167,0.3122,2.3849,2.921,6.0404,5.8774,4.8506,0.057,0.1878,0.1637,2.1372,2.7055,2.4477,4.438,1.6927,4.5114,2.9468,0.0387,5.4348,0.696,2.1043,4.7361,3.0592,4.9298,0.8816,2.9255,4.8924,7.3134,0.6711,1.4498,2.4118,4.9736,4.1312,2.723,4.6873,2.0565,5.6736,3.5444,0.2653,4.2251,0.311,7.7511,1.8394,0.9842,1.9222,2.8547,2.3778,4.2916,0.0252,2.9202,2.2295,4.394,1.8105,2.7887,5.4126,6.1339,1.8189,0.6328,3.1288,0.5863,5.8465,2.5588,5.8328,1.3072,5.001,0.6431,6.2508,0.5743,5.689,0.4752,3.3211,2.0698,0.208,1.7866,4.3472,5.437,3.2747,3.4639,2.6938,1.0492,2.7971,1.5307,5.1665,1.6496,0.2611,2.7331,0.0001,3.501,5.1929,0.9056,0.0046,6.2987,5.8146,0.4811,2.0525,4.3029,4.5443,2.1112,0.0723,1.9776,4.0039,0.5798,2.3164,4.824,0.6383,4.9356,0.7579,1.6336,3.9359,4.5627,1.8587,1.3986,3.4712,0.0169,3.2833,2.6082,3.8257,5.6358,0.7665,1.932,3.9125,1.4257,1.3179,3.8417,0.7913,3.3311,3.5553,0.2082,1.1761,3.9805,0.0214,1.787,2.1739,3.7342,2.0637,0.2194,0.2349,0.0005,6.1589,1.1125,1.1929,4.8481,1.3244,1.155,0.182,3.9267,0.2181,0.0028,0.7325,2.2442,0.6205,1.149,1.5995,2.2585,2.2163,2.3738,0.6728,1.1361,0.1135,0.009,0.0075,6.0184,5.5042,0.9996,6.12,2.936,2.8691,3.0992,4.8289,4.141,0.6624,1.5049,3.4469,3.1857,5.5181,0.5879,1.7225,1.3142,2.9844,0.0359,0.9616,2.105,2.2872,3.7473,0.4761,1.5181,2.0304,2.3885,4.0932,1.8052,5.1938,0.7551,1.656,1.8129,0.9134,2.2225,1.0263,7.2585,0.0069,0.6939,1.5779,5.2255,0.8193,4.6988,4.476,1.8015,4.4158,0.21,2.5174,1.3469,8.0758,0.6723,0.9214,6.1997,0.144,0.0403,0.0667,1.4693,3.2898,0.5016,6.0949,0.5322,1.4589,0.0314,5.7621,1.1203,3.4456,1.7482,2.5751,2.6945,3.471,0.0193,1.3077,2.4159,6.7071,2.0951,5.5783,0.6056,6.0882,0.2,4.2735,0.4013,0.7245,4.0007,1.4325,2.3039,6.6065,0.1669,5.2081,2.982,0.3978,0.6425,3.6081,0.0606,3.8537,1.5074,0.0757,1.3223,0.5338,4.5619,0.3851,5.1429,0.7752,7.2231,3.4251,3.7394,2.6504,1.9816,4.212,1.6848,0.063,7.1243,3.7938,4.1017,2.172,2.9629,2.0645,4.5236,2.2543,0.9997,3.8335,3.666,1.3264,5.326,0.3518,2.2111,4.9754,3.1881,2.2434,4.0598,0.0988,2.5763,1.891,2.9246,0.6165,5.448,6.2974,0.8788,1.2388,1.3589,1.1819,0.8175,2.0766,1.45,1.3023,3.915,0.4502,2.6034,4.0463,1.6148,1.4164,1.3374,5.2513,0.5633,0.1304,1.3064,3.4748,0.7086,0.9971,1.578,1.7828,3.231,0.0321,1.3678,2.1973,4.2095,0.9052,2.4473,2.1512,0.6497,0.8664,1.3808,4.2686,1.5605,2.4061,1.9052,2.2306,1.0551,3.3111,1.9064,3.0541,1.6563,4.8901,0.0159,1.2157,3.2556,0.1897,10.1441,7.0473,3.7346,0.0606,8.6545,0.2891,4.2368,6.0269,6.4583,2.7259,2.079,5.3053,1.1165,0.621,3.2796,0.9447,2.9528,6.646,2.4501,3.663,4.3211,1.2934,5.7271,0.1542,1.4757,1.038,3.4457,3.0511,2.6126,0.6999]}

What other secrets might be hiding in that dark house?","token_len":449,"entropy":[6.1108,3.6617,4.9913,1.8134,2.534,9.3688,1.266,0.3054,3.8415,3.0425,1.732,2.586,4.7232,0.4349,3.3886,3.1293,8.4606,4.2201,4.6067,1.3972,4.973,3.9687,0.6856,4.4071,1.6707,4.3156,9.3091,7.8649,0.5543,0.5933,1.1824,7.8077,2.2778,2.5147,1.8009,7.2684,0.5927,2.2761,4.1871,1.5486,3.0851,3.1248,1.4812,5.1029,2.9366,8.9889,2.621,5.2488,3.431,0.4604,5.4805,4.2326,2.958,2.9839,5.8099,6.5691,5.0512,0.8371,2.5597,1.6954,0.533,2.1588,3.9624,3.6098,1.2524,1.1291,1.2826,1.2321,0.0389,0.9334,4.7701,4.9695,1.0932,3.3603,3.5594,1.547,7.3498,3.6055,0.6293,0.0887,1.7396,3.8207,1.4381,3.5229,6.2487,1.5031,2.6254,4.9057,1.2921,2.5882,4.2843,0.0679,3.766,1.4636,9.2816,1.2483,1.1949,4.1928,6.5258,4.7697,1.9595,3.6388,1.9042,5.2598,5.0907,0.9742,7.3161,0.438,1.1027,1.5409,4.9628,2.5095,2.3216,1.7758,4.3923,5.3887,1.9571,1.1017,2.5755,0.2438,5.0568,0.5332,1.4703,8.403,0.6403,2.0565,2.8341,6.5341,2.2073,0.7958,0.4564,1.6287,1.7104,4.4136,5.853,1.4544,5.4752,7.4857,0.8282,5.4583,0.9085,3.8452,6.2541,1.442,5.2567,0.0106,1.9369,3.1924,4.6242,0.9873,6.5829,0.0623,0.9864,7.342,0.7262,5.0146,2.8197,0.4617,0.4019,0.0766,1.5259,0.8744,5.9167,2.2461,4.2854,5.3738,7.6735,2.8998,2.902,2.7332,0.0052,4.5151,2.3709,3.2016,0.4338,5.6672,1.5862,2.2674,1.1628,2.8472,2.6229,5.9768,0.9188,1.1024,0.9429,2.0723,3.7632,2.8023,1.6395,3.8597,4.6049,1.898,0.9103,0.0373,0.2989,0.6035,3.6357,4.0796,1.0968,4.8589,1.1671,5.2084,2.8713,0.853,5.6138,0.1754,1.1115,3.1118,3.0282,0.8048,2.0908,4.9376,4.478,1.8204,2.6546,6.5262,4.0502,7.3989,1.753,0.5549,2.5654,0.0412,0.3576,2.458,3.0428,1.406,4.7784,0.8196,4.8102,1.7451,0.4539,1.449,1.5539,6.9638,0.2835,2.863,0.8183,0.4836,0.3961,0.5328,0.6287,2.5312,3.6127,4.9175,3.5033,3.1645,4.2447,6.1023,1.4764,5.9805,8.8029,4.1495,2.7246,2.7488,1.8718,2.9515,1.8578,2.0205,6.4922,10.0046,1.4072,3.4504,0.3723,6.5479,0.6972,6.0225,2.0313,0.7936,5.1439,6.1272,1.3761,5.8336,2.648,1.4921,0.6331,0.5029,1.7163,5.8566,1.881,0.4918,7.5833,2.6885,1.6214,6.926,3.1372,8.7227,5.1729,5.9317,0.0131,0.7643,1.2433,6.2739,3.1648,5.7591,2.7718,0.7087,2.7157,4.0805,0.7097,0.4913,0.6975,4.7338,0.0566,0.942,3.7714,0.7517,1.8572,4.0451,6.274,0.3092,0.421,1.0191,0.5015,1.4275,1.403,4.7874,2.621,1.269,2.6505,1.4552,1.7165,3.0358,4.2569,2.4446,5.5339,2.2362,2.4717,1.4199,3.3928,2.6034,2.8899,3.0338,0.8008,0.8045,3.9403,0.3858,2.4386,4.7642,5.0051,0.1469,0.9136,1.9857,0.9439,2.1071,2.7472,3.9742,3.1648,3.1882,5.9236,4.9201,3.6017,0.0431,1.1528,2.198,9.7495,2.8169,3.0624,6.3815,1.8685,1.2651,2.8667,1.6042,2.0772,4.657,1.4901,2.7088,3.0575,0.9335,0.5783,1.5998,5.1681,2.0024,6.3557,5.7936,1.6234,3.1433,4.7128,1.1044,1.5547,6.7446,4.0805,0.7205,2.2305,5.6719,2.0115,3.1001,0.2566,0.5546,1.8639,0.1436,1.3474,7.0364,5.7898,2.7826,4.4056,7.4008,2.2302,4.5732,1.6217,3.7559,4.5144,0.2293,3.9266,3.0778,2.575,3.8299,2.4723,4.6121,4.6913,6.0898,0.9092,0.5331,0.5143,2.7632,4.0141,1.8555,3.344,0.2728,2.8233,0.9578,0.9459,1.5098,0.4547,2.4858,1.1218,0.1151,6.0936,5.6592,1.7177,5.0718,1.9362,6.6444,0.592,1.371,2.8971,3.5494,0.8217,1.4972,7.4412,6.1346,3.4406,3.4652,2.2309,1.252,3.2822,4.6281,4.7302,0.4768]}
{"prompt":"Most genies take your wishes literally to mess with you . But yours takes everything figuratively .","text":"Most genies take your wishes literally to mess with you. But yours takes everything figuratively. He did. How would i believe i could see my name and the name of the guy i love after the curse but it was real. He didn\u2019t know anything after i made up the curse and tried to break it.\nI was so upset about it and then my boyfriend told me he had read the post on this blog and knew it was a false story. My boyfriend went and helped me find out who actually wrote it and gave me the person\u2019s name and email address so i would contact their facebook, etc\u2026so that i wouldn\u2019t have to keep up on a daily basis checking to see if he were okay or anything. I still don\u2019t know who it was, because the story was just a lie and they are just messing with people. I told him and he said that he read the fake news story and thought i was being silly. So that was that. Now the only way to break the curse is by paying the price. But still i can\u2019t believe the guy who wrote it actually did it. I mean i thought this was a joke and it was made up by someone to mess with people and he actually wrote it\u2026..how can that be.\nMy boyfriend and i went out with a couple for drinks and after we left he texted me saying that he was worried that all of his friends in L. A. (he\u2019s from Chicago) are seeing his name and his girlfriend is seeing the exact same thing\u2026..and that he doesn\u2019t understand why this is happening\u2026\u2026.\nAnd then this morning he received a message from someone claiming to be from Disney telling her about the curse on her boyfriend because he\u2019s going to Chicago this weekend and she can\u2019t go for a few days (according to her message) and that she\u2019s worried about him and he shouldn\u2019t go. I tried to call the man a couple of times just to have a conversation, but my boyfriend has been unable to pick up the phone (which is odd because I\u2019m home alone and i have it set to my cell number).","token_len":451,"entropy":[10.7706,4.4084,6.9429,5.5226,9.587,6.2903,5.5971,9.1943,0.5362,1.8537,0.981,3.9245,7.856,5.3704,5.4197,7.8014,0.0199,0.6224,6.2461,5.0528,2.81,6.009,4.0952,7.6329,5.4264,4.5972,1.7161,4.6995,3.3175,5.3938,3.8125,3.7263,3.1594,0.234,2.173,3.3623,1.6827,2.111,5.2799,3.1581,8.1261,5.4989,3.4244,1.5072,4.237,2.4405,3.0578,3.6138,15.2297,7.6711,1.152,3.7344,4.5412,7.08,4.3037,4.4901,3.9308,1.9907,3.5426,2.3101,5.5824,0.3035,5.4101,1.3296,1.4801,3.618,5.4801,2.7866,2.6661,3.6505,2.6692,1.2816,2.2739,4.0264,3.8323,3.7698,2.6636,0.0541,1.9301,2.4778,5.2083,1.4835,4.6508,2.3456,4.1146,2.3294,0.9513,4.2542,2.6944,0.4201,2.5648,5.7279,1.0203,0.5427,4.2039,1.2567,4.0963,3.1472,6.2619,0.3988,3.1535,1.7773,2.2273,5.1634,1.6052,1.6603,1.4943,5.0858,0.0991,1.5916,6.4234,5.158,0.3059,1.0096,0.7006,1.7855,3.6927,0.6291,3.4859,0.9032,4.2234,6.3608,4.9871,6.2755,4.5623,7.0277,4.3818,5.8665,2.5155,1.5742,3.7176,0.5763,0.0541,0.1233,0.9094,0.1273,4.7541,3.438,5.1091,4.7253,2.4767,0.0714,8.2711,3.9724,0.15,0.5211,3.1928,6.9082,5.5802,2.3305,6.0728,0.5266,1.818,5.2693,1.8884,0.153,0.0235,0.0066,0.7455,1.4334,4.004,0.4548,2.089,4.8572,3.5673,3.8122,1.7673,3.3394,1.877,1.7452,1.7166,4.0312,3.8487,3.0843,5.4027,0.2764,3.5002,1.2734,1.7473,4.2378,0.6727,3.6452,0.8901,2.1173,2.3327,1.5669,5.4462,0.9051,6.2479,3.3708,2.711,0.7854,3.7806,2.6999,0.6903,4.0561,4.4024,1.1358,3.065,3.3405,1.3844,3.4614,0.2932,4.5517,3.8558,3.4583,2.8469,1.4092,4.9521,1.7258,0.4949,0.5037,2.9478,6.7026,3.0625,2.1006,1.0566,3.9662,6.047,3.0765,3.2607,1.3555,0.0135,0.001,0.9972,2.9934,2.3408,1.4597,1.5551,1.2427,7.0166,1.5836,1.0923,0.5374,1.9298,3.289,1.8973,3.9041,3.9303,0.8044,1.615,2.1769,1.4591,2.8796,0.7985,5.142,0.1617,2.1541,1.8489,4.3732,4.8917,0.054,3.3872,2.2308,3.3504,4.4495,3.9031,0.6954,8.7444,5.1765,2.6424,3.6943,0.4679,3.0656,1.6055,3.9376,0.6845,2.3762,1.5001,2.9201,2.5599,3.4964,1.8389,3.854,6.579,3.3684,1.0214,3.8407,2.0385,2.5939,0.9853,4.9246,0.201,2.6937,1.1333,0.7666,1.4794,4.4374,1.8756,5.711,1.4677,1.9632,0.4508,4.3001,6.5867,0.446,7.4827,0.2322,5.1576,4.1968,2.5889,0.0738,0.1418,2.5592,4.5675,0.511,3.3362,5.5043,2.797,2.0493,1.5601,3.5662,4.6498,2.8467,3.7742,3.2983,5.1922,0.0648,1.6826,6.3356,2.2824,1.9545,1.5576,4.0904,0.2714,0.0315,0.0105,3.5767,1.4523,3.9623,1.2845,0.6482,6.9807,2.6117,2.5452,4.0009,1.5353,5.0261,3.7643,1.384,5.3916,0.987,2.0359,0.584,3.722,3.2456,0.6212,0.2277,2.5281,8.4627,3.7032,5.0263,4.6987,1.2775,2.1387,3.1751,1.2545,4.1226,4.7119,1.0632,3.0925,0.0298,0.1776,4.2146,0.2046,6.9145,4.1332,1.1749,1.4032,2.3353,3.867,1.0509,0.0202,0.0031,2.6593,4.6848,1.3393,4.8099,0.4569,5.8455,6.7562,0.0078,1.673,7.5755,0.8312,1.6186,2.3508,1.5432,1.7668,0.017,0.1599,4.4954,0.8026,1.3606,1.8539,2.4493,5.7565,0.0743,0.0096,0.0271,2.2493,2.3243,2.2924,5.862,0.4613,2.8865,2.315,3.9208,5.7246,3.372,0.6369,0.4176,5.3502,0.2498,4.8953,2.4046,1.7598,2.5155,0.3351,4.6138,1.0775,4.7262,2.0033,5.4952,0.0108,5.2746,0.2752,2.7475,0.0876,4.1518,3.5291,1.3621,5.8278,1.3176,1.5666,3.4575,0.014,1.0941,6.0474,3.2854,2.0861,3.9771,2.8105,6.2629,4.4917,2.211,3.1872,3.607,5.1733,2.2448]}

You have no passion for anything.\nIt took you months to get that cute little one. You must have done all kinds of things to make sure everything was perfect. You know, you put her on all the right clothes. You thought it was the most perfect birthday present for your dad. But you were a fool. The father loved you but what of the baby? Do you really think he wanted a baby? Does he really know how hard it is to have a little one? He was just glad that his birthday was right around the corner. You should have at least given him something he wanted. He will have plenty of chances to make things right with you. But the baby? He had to put up a good front to get that thing in the crib. He told the kid himself that he had to be firm and make her pay. She wasn't that happy when she woke up next to her old father and found that it had to stay put. She tried to scream but he wouldn't let her. She tried to jump up and leave but he slapped her down. He said the baby is still so small she won't have time to figure out a comfortable way. And you know, the father, he wasn't going to let that one get away with his trick. He held her firmly as she tried to climb out. When she finally stopped fighting, he threw her back inside the crib. She cried for the rest of the day. She always wanted to stand up and say hi to everyone before she went to sleep but the father wouldn't let her. She was still scared of him.\nWhat a sad story. Just when she is getting to the point where she has her own mind and can stand up for herself. Well, that was until she meets the boy and he starts kissing her. All of her efforts were to no avail. All she could do was smile for the camera.\nIt wasn't that she was scared of the father. The father had tried to kiss her but she had stopped him. She was terrified of him but still couldn't help herself. Then he starts kissing her.

Diet drinks actually cause noticeable weight loss. Vitamin drinks heal injuries and disease, and so on. Some are even available as food items.\nA very popular example of this is Vitamin Drinks in Japan. The Japanese government has approved a number of food products, containing vitamins, as natural supplements, to be sold in public areas. These are known as Kaketsutsumi ( \u98f2\u307f\u6dfb\u7f72 ).\nAt a time when the Japanese public are very concerned about health, the government has sanctioned the sale of drinks that contain vitamins and natural herbs as nutrients and supplements, not as drugs. They also allow the sale of such drinks in a number of public areas, such as pharmacies, stores, and medical clinics.\nAs this system is not legal, the sale of the products has to be carried out through shops and supermarkets that buy products from pharmaceutical and chemical companies and then resell them to the public. In Japan, vitamin drinks can be purchased from any food store. It is also common for them to be sold by private individuals on the side of the road.\nVitamin and herbal beverages are also often sold by convenience store stores, such as Family Mart ( Family Mart \u306b\u3088\u308b ) in Japan and the U.S. Supervalu ( \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 ) stores.\nThese can also be bought from grocery stores, such as ALF ( ALF \u306b\u3088\u308b ) in Japan. Grocery stores make the drinks available to people in the vicinity who can not afford such products.\nThis is not legal and many stores also offer them for free.

Your task is to find them and save them!","token_len":454,"entropy":[7.4262,4.5543,8.2694,11.3113,2.8131,0.6009,1.2797,7.3219,10.9491,5.3574,2.6644,4.9009,3.8184,3.2788,9.4769,1.4849,0.2902,4.4083,5.1395,1.3068,3.8731,2.6986,1.2914,4.7865,5.1194,2.8008,4.8496,0.869,1.8463,6.1326,1.5103,3.0936,5.0365,0.0044,0.1958,1.1981,3.9781,8.5765,12.6818,1.8077,5.1879,0.4776,9.5359,1.7177,0.0707,17.726,3.3784,7.2332,3.7016,9.8056,1.5736,6.9118,6.8288,0.086,2.6586,3.2231,0.023,2.8962,8.3485,1.467,2.3119,4.9918,0.0183,4.1429,2.2559,4.0449,7.9608,0.7865,5.0473,5.5882,3.3519,8.6175,2.4563,0.4671,1.9364,5.6098,7.7392,0.6573,3.7266,8.7543,0.2098,0.8585,1.6746,4.8153,2.7516,6.972,4.2741,0.355,4.1469,4.0396,3.2693,6.2933,0.9461,0.3277,3.4642,4.8979,0.6871,1.1234,6.059,0.0001,0.0007,2.1847,4.9032,0.0131,3.5234,4.6826,2.3226,3.1939,0.8703,1.586,0.0055,1.9675,4.4258,2.2883,2.3846,5.6989,2.7037,6.1268,2.461,0.1772,0.3173,6.9266,7.9856,3.3104,1.7078,3.8957,7.2626,2.8371,2.0403,11.0955,0.6135,2.9753,3.5207,4.5067,4.7133,0.5683,1.29,4.7677,0.1128,4.5007,4.408,2.0624,1.3404,2.5174,4.8746,4.4887,6.2655,4.3931,0.6318,2.9647,5.383,0.6458,2.7491,3.9752,0.7789,1.2896,1.6262,5.0075,1.3942,0.5194,7.3812,1.5241,5.3012,2.0426,3.1394,0.0018,14.4574,8.4247,4.0129,5.1054,2.9418,2.2267,3.2324,4.6919,2.024,1.0318,0.8351,0.501,4.3575,4.7654,2.8032,3.1342,3.0851,2.869,3.7835,2.3266,2.8198,0.5466,5.0278,3.8414,2.5093,1.5194,5.2773,1.6631,0.0015,3.0866,4.4118,1.5879,1.8575,3.7192,0.1195,5.8989,2.1763,2.4273,0.8541,0.4471,1.3199,2.4507,7.4701,1.0547,1.4704,6.6086,6.0055,1.3002,5.1399,3.6764,2.5712,2.2966,3.0266,3.7106,1.1985,6.014,3.9828,1.1896,4.2168,2.1634,0.3236,0.1138,1.0996,4.8218,4.8751,4.0739,1.4611,6.1089,4.5744,8.059,5.6558,0.1125,1.6488,4.9009,0.6878,4.2311,0.2864,2.9166,1.9906,7.1005,5.9371,6.7457,2.0738,2.6856,7.3729,2.3989,3.1976,7.3872,5.5335,5.1624,7.3714,4.4797,2.1009,0.4323,2.7937,3.1,4.6037,0.8362,3.3348,0.2326,1.1749,4.2912,1.4459,0.2299,0.0061,1.8511,4.2677,1.548,1.3922,3.9972,7.3345,0.7995,2.5051,3.0484,0.5119,0.0065,5.917,1.0394,0.7425,0.8541,5.102,5.4816,0.1045,0.0037,0.0053,4.5742,1.2001,3.0199,3.1456,1.0362,2.7739,1.7299,5.3421,0.1606,4.4243,3.282,1.7091,5.5129,1.6456,0.0132,1.7064,0.3044,6.4209,6.3925,4.3078,1.3778,6.021,3.9555,3.9385,2.9315,0.6229,3.1515,0.3145,1.9799,2.0739,5.9935,1.7592,2.4526,3.2424,1.9752,2.7695,3.5099,1.6993,3.1487,0.0083,4.8443,0.8023,3.5399,2.9518,1.1609,1.04,5.1892,2.5203,3.4894,5.7736,2.3755,1.8811,3.799,1.3768,0.9639,4.6873,2.9877,3.8084,1.1614,2.9224,5.4194,1.241,0.1496,0.1452,2.2518,2.7812,1.3973,0.9121,0.3922,1.6552,2.8401,4.3153,5.5669,1.1944,7.6347,0.3129,0.4256,5.0394,1.4374,0.18,0.0077,1.6175,7.2928,6.0064,6.4302,0.8131,0.1648,1.9125,5.0208,1.4745,6.9747,0.9557,4.6136,2.5555,2.4032,5.5886,1.1855,5.8246,3.2523,0.8895,4.0016,2.6582,1.5807,0.2418,9.1168,5.6027,5.1364,0.2447,2.3123,0.6148,2.5084,0.544,5.763,0.0763,1.5971,7.3769,0.1928,3.2643,4.1593,0.9393,4.4367,5.9733,1.6139,1.9542,1.8758,2.1748,4.9338,1.4092,3.1146,0.0002,0.865,4.3607,0.3961,3.0703,4.0482,0.0564,1.3702,0.8288,4.5169,0.003,3.3435,4.9813,0.0255,0.4301,3.1984,5.2099,1.3646,0.8262,0.4502,1.223,4.7236,1.3148,3.6584,4.7525,0.1967,0.1239,1.2352,1.1872,0.953,2.3052,0.2095,3.4777]}

What a perfect movie this is for me! I will tell you guys all about him the minute I see it.\u201d\n\u201cThis movie will rock your entire world! From the beautiful art, great characters, and great performances, to being told stories in the very way that we live our lives, it is the absolute best movie ever! I can go on and on about the movie.\u201d\nA few years ago, I had to give away my original version of the Rough Rider (the early 70\u2019s R.R.) for the good of the project. The film features a classic 70\u2019s soundtrack and music. This gave us a great opportunity to introduce a classic 70\u2019s theme to the film.\nI hope you enjoy this music as much as we did. The album that comes with the Rough Rider has everything you need to play the movie. Includes the following pieces.\nI have added some of my personal favorite music pieces to this collection. I chose the pieces because they fit the movie very well. The theme music from The Twilight Zone by Leonard Bernstein is a great segue song for the movie.\nOnce again, you are all invited to come here and enjoy some new films, to talk about your favorites, and share your thoughts and experiences. It makes this a much more rewarding experience.","token_len":455,"entropy":[3.4747,5.9903,5.9881,1.0915,2.6819,6.3051,2.0372,14.5949,0.0555,5.858,0.0535,0.6608,1.5369,6.6086,0.7107,7.0031,5.2098,0.2737,4.8491,1.9545,0.7468,5.0062,0.0376,4.7437,2.0856,4.5603,2.3952,2.437,0.0246,1.2551,4.3754,2.4222,5.3447,0.0081,0.0008,3.9755,1.6806,0.5848,0.3742,4.7476,0.3558,6.33,1.9476,4.5078,0.0011,0.6339,1.3857,4.1666,2.2397,3.5224,0.0576,7.0313,1.2981,0.3896,0.0014,3.0342,0.3222,0.6879,5.7037,1.6897,2.0138,2.0676,6.8484,4.2111,1.7289,4.4014,1.9238,1.9149,3.6105,0.8941,1.9247,6.7672,2.4665,3.0706,4.2067,0.3102,1.4116,4.1376,0.6912,2.0161,2.241,5.1429,2.3191,0.2781,1.7546,1.6794,2.244,2.1801,8.6162,11.0609,7.7435,6.0546,5.4523,1.1742,6.3358,4.7255,1.5142,5.6994,4.4126,1.9594,3.4989,0.4754,2.4828,3.7435,5.3694,1.0378,0.9229,4.5406,1.812,2.7197,1.7405,4.482,2.1437,3.8899,1.1911,4.482,0.4016,3.4482,13.8008,8.4934,1.7523,4.9898,2.4854,2.0399,2.4812,2.466,0.9919,2.4988,6.2845,2.3833,7.3016,0.2124,0.0555,1.4141,0.3029,3.9085,4.1425,1.4914,6.2756,0.8775,0.973,4.4532,1.5658,0.8434,0.6234,0.0468,2.8826,2.1796,1.9383,0.3379,2.2731,0.3478,3.0056,4.9022,1.2649,1.7787,2.5743,1.5627,5.9673,1.2715,1.0853,0.8854,12.9796,3.6551,5.1148,1.4341,7.2126,2.6903,1.6013,5.6041,4.1824,1.8448,0.7816,4.2027,4.2541,2.5168,0.069,6.4606,4.6481,1.0517,0.4676,0.9343,3.9406,5.8231,1.214,4.4515,4.0694,4.6613,0.7735,3.2821,2.1168,1.2385,2.3547,3.5804,3.6072,0.1336,5.9178,3.3621,0.4377,4.3594,5.8902,5.4189,0.8134,1.0007,0.4311,1.1723,1.1252,1.401,0.5363,0.3973,0.1053,2.8944,1.5731,3.1324,7.7565,1.2052,5.2025,1.8173,1.3986,6.8758,1.4787,5.9174,5.3884,2.9657,5.1279,2.6124,0.4251,1.4318,2.9142,2.5405,1.7926,0.9152,6.4629,6.3602,4.0983,3.0568,2.476,4.5998,5.1908,1.5268,3.6119,4.5674,1.6653,0.0377,1.3072,2.2473,0.9937,2.7635,3.9743,0.9835,1.088,1.8627,3.3575,2.9405,2.3596,6.4284,0.9836,0.4577,0.027,0.5104,2.5278,2.6777,3.4057,0.6369,0.7277,0.2862,6.5403,3.5907,2.7621,0.3451,0.5371,0.5265,2.7254,2.9755,4.0214,4.4939,1.3398,5.9702,5.0427,0.1449,1.332,11.9466,1.667,3.5935,2.5858,6.8824,4.8173,9.1472,1.5794,1.2483,6.1765,3.2656,1.9258,1.7037,2.5062,3.8094,4.9783,0.1223,1.2098,4.9823,0.3916,2.891,2.7143,4.7864,1.5171,6.2319,6.1879,1.1607,0.0284,0.1431,5.5699,2.2892,5.5385,1.706,3.2029,5.6913,4.2341,1.0102,2.1699,1.7679,0.0745,5.3715,2.434,5.42,2.1348,0.1536,0.0062,0.0097,3.5626,2.0337,0.8375,2.3922,0.6084,2.747,3.3177,3.945,0.4247,1.5273,1.1607,6.9889,4.2896,0.0315,0.0321,3.9278,0.455,0.8626,3.7461,6.7353,4.9412,3.9224,0.7691,0.9192,5.5254,0.0066,3.8353,5.287,0.9827,0.6717,0.4725,3.7309,1.4013,1.8676,1.0063,8.2121,2.1811,5.4413,6.907,3.273,0.7893,3.9963,2.7438,4.8331,2.5085,2.2393,1.2534,3.8372,1.6799,3.1742,4.4806,1.5536,1.2435,3.8074,0.6387,2.2497,5.491,2.1024,5.2411,3.8035,0.8007,3.3459,1.6703,2.0834,3.1121,0.1018,0.407,2.3666,5.6828,2.6746,4.1457,3.7783,9.088,0.1871,5.2059,7.133,2.9705,1.0572,2.0425,1.7655,9.5977,0.0726,6.0618,1.8321,1.0126,0.8491,0.3214,1.0954,6.7375,0.8257,0.1692,3.4584,2.5758,4.0993,1.3786,0.1533,2.9526,4.9517,1.1918,3.1504,3.9942,6.1618,6.0245,2.9458,4.5248,4.6432,0.6859,2.1521,4.0565,0.7737,0.6086,4.6153,0.6219,2.1677,1.5418,1.717,1.1873,3.9191,4.5123,2.9529,1.9056,3.8245,0.7661,4.8818,0.5064,1.0701]}

{"prompt":"Guardian angels do n't just keep you safe out of the goodness of their hearts , they have some other reason , and you are the very first to find it out","text":"Guardian angels don't just keep you safe out of the goodness of their hearts, they have some other reason, and you are the very first to find it out if you are open enough to receive this gift. In my vision and reading of the tarot I have seen them working as a team, in teams from where they came from they were very powerful indeed and were able to make such changes in the life and health of people like never before. As they are very powerful entities I believe that the angels came to our planet as guardians and protections to prevent people from misusing or abusing these very powerful entities. Now if only we can just all agree to work together not only to keep things together but also to try and save this planet for all to live off.\nI have said to myself how do I get the message into my life but I can not seem to remember where I have heard it so I have made some comments and now I feel I am getting it somewhere. This is the first article I have read and the first I have left an article on and I am so grateful to the writer for being really very powerful and for sharing such a positive message with all of us today. I am so happy I read your article and what you have said, I will think about all this and try and put it into practice, I am sure it will help, I thank you so much for saying so and for sharing such powerful words here it has been a great blessing to me this morning. I am feeling positive more and more every day and it is now not just my life but every other human lives I see are suffering so I think it will become very important to try and change everything and see things differently and not accept things as normal. I will do my very best to give more positive energy as there is so much negative energy in this world right now, I try and see the good parts but there is so much and I think I have seen enough and see life in a different way and try and be a better person and more aware of what I believe and I am going to do what people have said I can only do it in this life so the next one I will have to do it in heaven I hope, I just have to get on with it.","token_len":457,"entropy":[6.6896,13.9728,5.9832,0.0063,3.8965,5.26,3.6806,1.6931,6.3933,2.0666,1.8759,8.4948,0.2744,1.1192,0.7782,1.2288,0.3961,4.7698,4.5703,3.278,5.9589,4.7237,2.5709,4.2008,4.2131,3.2227,6.5768,1.9542,0.6502,3.8869,2.2614,2.4831,6.1152,0.2567,2.1596,7.1137,5.8722,1.0701,5.5657,4.1262,4.0925,0.4634,4.4477,3.6497,8.5928,5.4091,5.9309,0.7654,1.1923,10.7834,0.0457,5.1711,2.1533,2.3398,5.1183,6.8794,3.0663,1.6568,4.6568,1.5191,4.331,7.1846,5.8354,6.0221,1.3727,5.1707,1.2551,7.5598,3.0858,3.6241,5.0133,6.0716,2.8019,3.6262,1.7839,0.0128,3.7703,5.292,4.8868,1.5392,1.194,5.1155,3.3492,3.6831,0.0252,2.6386,5.2162,10.0406,0.0069,0.3042,4.0812,2.7078,3.2356,4.2397,2.4407,7.1622,3.1777,2.9288,1.5502,2.6991,4.5761,6.9784,0.9672,4.7607,2.9238,3.2602,5.6443,1.7222,9.8117,2.3994,4.3039,4.2222,0.2687,6.3328,0.844,3.2253,2.3935,3.4514,5.7302,0.9083,2.439,0.7751,5.0238,3.6309,4.0192,1.6029,4.574,4.8883,6.5896,4.7438,1.7239,5.0641,0.2701,6.4548,1.2667,0.5083,3.3546,4.6445,5.8221,0.7085,1.1492,0.3557,4.5931,1.0157,4.1916,3.7193,0.8509,3.2457,2.6723,3.0214,4.2899,6.3931,2.0194,1.4203,5.8083,2.4101,4.9762,4.5144,2.7786,4.3278,7.511,0.8928,2.4748,2.894,3.1623,6.3761,0.2451,6.3194,5.3901,1.2956,2.6477,4.6769,4.7747,0.0043,5.1894,3.7342,0.9398,3.2393,2.8644,0.4568,4.1658,0.7441,2.0025,4.7488,2.6696,5.7459,2.6131,4.7887,0.6442,4.1547,2.5507,1.889,2.6725,1.7053,6.2141,0.5887,3.818,0.9542,2.3608,2.0274,7.2596,0.9868,0.6057,2.9213,1.9402,3.6144,1.4445,2.8979,0.759,7.306,6.9367,2.4313,2.3556,3.2058,1.2754,1.3896,2.5396,1.944,1.3688,2.1328,6.6506,1.2773,4.108,7.2326,6.5092,7.0433,0.946,3.3308,2.7359,4.625,0.9092,4.0318,1.5886,1.7444,3.4384,0.8211,0.5423,6.0977,0.2132,1.6563,1.8638,1.656,2.5429,2.0,3.2055,3.1547,1.3132,0.5547,5.699,0.9532,0.8186,2.1928,3.7643,1.386,3.0584,5.5094,0.8741,3.9123,3.0127,1.5954,3.6134,1.6997,4.5323,1.4308,1.4682,3.6553,3.5606,1.8652,1.779,2.6773,1.9831,0.273,1.4457,4.3782,1.5665,5.2114,0.0507,1.4806,0.0242,0.5511,6.1139,1.2308,1.6761,2.5398,1.6413,3.6262,6.4294,1.9579,5.6446,7.2329,3.3669,1.0684,1.5948,1.978,4.3953,1.1885,2.3936,6.2103,2.7562,0.8206,1.8315,1.8607,6.0659,6.4163,6.637,1.5068,0.264,3.7485,0.118,1.1401,3.0343,0.8961,4.5719,5.9605,1.8112,2.4187,2.856,0.6898,4.4569,2.6502,2.2929,6.351,3.298,3.8919,5.3474,5.5814,3.6947,1.081,3.8236,1.5724,2.3682,5.5695,3.0944,0.9802,0.8691,3.1745,0.2852,4.2538,5.3452,1.8029,4.3218,4.7497,3.5682,2.1901,3.0876,7.1332,3.0557,1.5307,4.0311,1.0912,1.3185,3.0102,3.1052,1.0587,4.4415,0.0043,0.4709,3.7417,4.6452,3.0219,4.47,4.2963,6.0547,0.6294,1.5329,0.0504,4.6041,0.4038,1.997,1.6086,0.2773,3.4127,0.0174,2.4358,1.5109,6.0699,1.9662,3.8456,2.6243,3.2042,6.5392,4.1258,2.8122,0.6081,1.0563,0.029,6.2487,1.4438,2.648,2.3881,2.0523,3.1675,4.1956,1.7418,5.4918,6.668,2.949,2.0022,1.9889,0.8219,1.8349,5.3109,0.9386,3.785,2.6542,1.1159,0.3981,1.9223,4.0583,4.1795,0.3948,1.7289,2.2129,4.9739,1.8004,2.8464,1.8028,3.3506,0.0516,2.118,3.016,7.6853,2.8691,1.7487,1.813,3.6652,5.9686,0.5788,3.3722,3.0565,2.1699,2.8349,2.8162,4.9942,2.8381,2.8341,1.5854,1.2716,3.9086,0.459,1.8637,2.6334,1.1483,6.2612,4.3247,1.834,3.9306,1.4767,4.6461,3.4353,0.498,3.283,3.7166,0.5169,0.377,1.1886]}
{"prompt":"A world where each person needs to laugh at least once a day . Death awaits at midnight if they have n't .","text":"A world where each person needs to laugh at least once a day. Death awaits at midnight if they haven't. The world is a beautiful place and when people live that way, they are very beautiful too!\nIf you see a beautiful woman in a field or somewhere else, you are very lucky to see her and be near him. To get close to him, you must do it while you are alone. In front of a crowd, you must be careful. He might be interested in somebody else. You will never have a chance to find him.\nThe best thing about the day he died was the one we did not wake the night that followed. You wake up and realize what you did. I think its not too late to say this. My last words to her would have been that she had been worth everything we had. I dont know it was love I felt for her, or something like. But its one of the best experiences anyone has been through. I remember being a little kid and hearing her and her mom sing all the time. I would try and go up to her and start talking to her. But she would run away. To her mom. To him and any woman she favors. I never lost the drive to get close to her. But in the back of my mind i knew that was in her best interests. I know now she wasnt as bad for a girl as i thought. But i never lost the drive to try and get close to her when possible.\nBut i was right. People love and cherish their old friends and family always. I was there and could see it. It was very sad.\nLove is strange. I had a crush on my best friends sister. I also lost my virginity to a friend. One of my best friends and girlfriends had a threesome while we were high school and the other one was just looking for a threesome. My girlfriend thought her guy was cool he was nice and funny.\nThis was written by Gokhan Gokbulut. Posted on Thursday, June 22, 2017, at 9:32 am. Filed under General. Bookmark the permalink.

Most people choose to have their hair grow and cover it in order to live a normal life. You just found out the back of your head is blank. Use it well.\nAround midnight on October 31, 2012, I was talking with several friends on the phone. One of them told me that she heard a massive earthquake in the middle of the night. Some of my friends did not believe this. They are very religious, they told me not to talk about this stuff. I explained that this is the nature of an earthquake. It doesn\u2019t care if we have religious beliefs or not.\nIn the middle of the night, the sky went crazy. I do not know what it was, but it went crazy and the stars had to fall. I do not know why. Maybe it was the earth itself trying to show some signs. This is why God allowed the earth to go crazy at this time. Everything that we do that goes outside of nature, like religions, should be abandoned. We should all be atheists. Only nature is real. All other stuff is nothing.\nWhen the stars fall, we know that life is ending. This is in the Bible, and we have to understand why God made this. All the life forms that we have on this planet have their own end date. If life isn\u2019t around for 500 years, the planet and the animals will get wiped out.\nAt the time I was talking to my friends, God decided to tell them to make an earthquake to scare people so the earth could get rid of all the people before the end of time. This is why I told them to make an earthquake instead of fighting the earthquake. All the earthquakes and volcanic activity are part of the end of time. God gave us all these things to scare everyone away. Maybe we are not making this news good enough. Maybe we should say in the Bible that \u201cHe killed seven thousand of his angels without the authority of God\u201d. There are many things in the Bible about heaven and hell. In both places, the last people will be given punishments. This is the time to get ready.","token_len":458,"entropy":[10.6433,1.8989,2.7465,1.1863,3.1613,8.6329,0.0312,0.6177,6.675,2.2884,4.7112,1.8601,4.0837,0.2018,1.4382,1.9525,1.1433,2.217,3.1509,5.5976,3.5573,0.0461,5.9954,9.8404,1.5666,4.8717,2.8009,3.7249,0.7949,1.6796,1.5038,5.3005,3.5994,5.5084,8.5005,3.3787,2.1779,5.024,0.0292,4.8147,2.1878,1.9098,0.3612,0.4117,5.078,6.222,9.4329,0.3166,3.0098,6.8234,0.4025,0.7005,0.0864,0.6795,9.8007,1.0582,8.3179,4.0903,7.7452,1.3489,1.2097,14.2101,7.3574,0.8765,4.0646,3.1927,0.9003,4.3087,0.2741,2.6639,1.9154,5.8962,1.4011,6.1227,1.189,3.6514,1.3148,0.7639,1.1646,2.1802,0.3535,0.4794,2.971,0.0624,1.1813,2.0601,5.3382,1.5284,7.2513,5.5016,2.1636,1.5663,2.76,0.0173,0.4607,0.2032,1.2413,5.8867,1.7354,2.5676,0.2687,5.5477,0.4245,2.2448,3.1197,1.6594,2.1665,5.2803,3.3218,4.1884,1.8029,2.9672,6.353,0.0651,5.876,0.0246,3.2681,1.2657,2.7326,4.2137,1.0725,1.2217,4.8334,0.8845,2.7541,1.6664,2.2715,7.7908,0.0191,5.1253,0.0968,0.8719,2.1052,4.0825,16.743,6.6509,0.5864,6.6202,1.2901,4.5038,3.0787,7.0163,0.7672,1.276,0.0522,0.308,2.7726,3.8637,1.4908,1.7584,0.0031,0.279,0.1163,0.4457,2.0597,4.3601,2.9219,5.2759,0.6471,1.3233,6.7113,0.0826,0.8346,1.2992,2.6321,0.3087,1.8913,0.3869,1.4248,4.3757,2.4535,2.6551,3.3533,6.866,5.5593,3.372,2.4912,1.3514,1.1231,4.6684,0.1231,0.437,2.3035,1.5334,4.7266,0.8378,0.2266,2.0979,5.5507,2.9414,7.087,0.0206,7.7158,3.4887,3.8166,3.8751,4.5562,1.099,2.9509,4.9423,5.3309,2.2242,1.4943,0.0829,2.4097,0.6674,4.6574,2.6397,0.5314,0.5264,6.9215,2.3774,2.0869,2.0564,4.4991,4.0515,4.9573,0.8036,4.9171,2.1497,4.3675,8.8478,0.555,4.9557,0.7985,7.4815,0.5457,2.3894,0.9532,3.1398,1.6279,7.1452,0.6458,6.8072,7.6351,2.1033,4.6682,0.5448,4.357,3.6651,5.0029,1.09,5.4291,0.8331,1.1766,3.5641,2.2113,6.4764,2.2229,0.3703,2.1594,4.1833,1.1429,4.9341,0.8915,3.7258,0.4639,3.5295,0.5215,5.9573,1.5129,2.0649,2.0075,1.8654,2.2766,2.5328,1.5718,3.9613,2.7429,2.8813,3.1888,2.329,2.6464,4.695,2.2801,4.369,4.5652,1.6222,1.3424,1.8365,3.6119,1.6484,0.3071,2.5432,4.2135,2.1425,4.37,3.0486,0.5456,3.0155,3.0433,5.012,3.3364,0.308,0.1194,5.4187,2.9169,7.4083,0.447,0.2747,3.8509,3.0571,5.0277,1.5633,5.1943,1.2277,4.8211,3.791,0.0575,0.5207,2.1963,4.9894,1.7416,2.519,2.0379,0.7342,1.1029,0.9216,1.2623,0.9576,0.2501,5.0206,3.5078,0.8753,4.7591,1.2189,1.8048,4.7916,3.4279,4.5855,3.0727,4.8731,3.0114,4.9001,4.1663,1.1109,2.4616,2.6218,1.3913,0.0021,2.6888,0.89,4.0134,6.342,1.6021,1.9318,0.1236,0.9543,0.1275,2.7573,1.022,2.1504,2.472,3.9897,0.4653,0.9479,1.7057,0.4865,0.0516,5.142,0.3032,5.8398,2.023,3.427,0.6133,5.1532,1.5132,3.6428,3.6711,5.0828,2.7836,3.1512,4.2384,0.0174,1.1322,3.8965,0.3804,0.5037,0.6304,3.7468,3.2707,0.981,2.8532,3.8083,1.5822,1.7404,6.7559,4.8766,2.3382,0.8071,6.6928,2.1189,2.7701,2.3319,5.8476,2.9251,7.9788,8.4441,0.713,0.6675,2.6732,1.0153,3.1765,5.4162,5.9315,1.4151,1.5331,0.9058,11.2055,4.5158,7.5352,6.8364,5.7802,3.1827,2.7769,1.927,4.1384,7.1257,4.4601,6.8263,0.3152,1.0241,0.1943,7.3692,3.2487,5.0925,1.5735,1.7077,1.9237,2.2285,0.4082,0.1946,3.6057,4.7495,1.0695,0.4029,1.5064,4.5054,6.0018,3.1603,0.8183,2.0402,6.2111,3.5951,3.8072,1.2033,5.1174,7.6292,1.1324,3.1558,0.4924,2.0646,4.6131,2.398,4.1444,5.9792,1.8246]}

Can you imagine what you would like it to be like, what kind of furniture you think it probably would need, and what colours and fabrics might be most suitable to enhance or match the furniture. Can you think of any ways this room could look improved with extra lighting? Can you add things in or change things out to make it fit your own definition of the \" perfect\" layout. Now your room might look more like a home to you. Are there any areas it is hard to get on with? How can you make it work for you and maybe make it even more like your dream home. Can you think of any of the ideas on this page that you may find helpful for doing just that, or have any other ideas that you think would help make it even better. Now sit with your chosen room. Can you relax as if you're still there? Your eyes need to be able to take in every detail. Take time to do this and you will feel the effect of the room.

Use it as a challenge to see what you can really do with a tiny space. Have fun with it! It will soon be over. Remember: there is no problem area. Everything is working. Go back to the list and pick out a few things. Now focus on those. Take time to think about them and see if you can find some solutions to them.

{"prompt":"The price of baby teeth skyrocket leaving numerous children with bars of gold under their pillows","text":"The price of baby teeth skyrocket leaving numerous children with bars of gold under their pillows. This could be due to their growing in a world of cheap teeth whitening products.\nYour dentist, of course, can still fix a bar of gold out of your teeth, but it\u2019s not advisable, and in some cases could even be dangerous.\nTooth decay is a common problem. If you don\u2019t fix it, decay and infection can worsen and infect your other teeth. Not to mention, if enough decay has gone untreated, cavities could eventually cause your jawbone to rot away.\nThe tooth replacement material is quite easy to fabricate. So, if you have not yet filed for dental work, it\u2019s time to file that off! Your dentist is ready to see you now.\nCrowns play an important role in protecting your teeth from decay, cavities, and tooth discoloration. Your teeth are your gateway for food and liquids. When they are well cared for, they act as a protective shield for your stomach. When they aren\u2019t, it could lead to complications in your digestive tract.\nIf your tooth is severely decayed, it could become impossible to repair with conventional dental work. The decay has severely attacked your tooth to the point that only a full mouth reconstruction, such as dental implants, can provide the kind of dental protection that a tooth replacement is designed to provide.\nIf one or more teeth in your mouth are badly worn or missing, it\u2019s only going to get much worse, especially if you don\u2019t put in the work to keep your teeth healthy. The other teeth are bound to move. If you keep them in place by attaching them with dental bridges, dental implants, or dental crowns, your teeth health is bound to improve.

{"prompt":"Self driving cars are common place . Windows auto darken so you can sleep during long trips . You 've just woken , but this is definitely not your intended destination ...","text":"Self driving cars are common place. Windows auto darken so you can sleep during long trips. You've just woken, but this is definitely not your intended destination... This is probably a nightmare story to hear after you fall asleep after a long night and woke up in another room to find the home you bought is not the one you thought it was. Even though there are ways to avoid some of the common mistakes in buying of this, it is very hard to predict which problems might crop up. Know that your home inspector is more than likely going to be able to identify and fix any issues you find. Some of the worst home problems you 'll find come from an unexpected source. Common Home mistakes that are hard to identify\n1. The wallpaper on the wall is damaged. It looks fine on the surface, but there is no reason the wall has been patched. There is a hole on the wall that is not seen when the wall is removed to check the plumbing. When inspecting the house, it can be hard to spot these. A professional home inspectors can be trained to pick those things up or the inspector looking at the home to see if there is a problem that is not obvious.\n2. Walls are missing a lot of plaster. This is an easy issue to spot, but that doesn't mean it must be fixed, depending on the reasons why. Home inspectors are trained in recognizing the kind of wall and plastering that is typical. If most of the walls are painted and do not show plaster they are most likely to have been recently changed or repaired. But if they are painted and have plaster that shows they are old and were likely to have been in the house for a long time. This doesn't mean every surface has to be covered with a coat of plastering. This is only a way of helping home buyers to better evaluate a home and how the home is being maintained.\n4. Exposures of wet pipe work. If you see water stains on the walls or floors, you may want to have your pipes inspected. If they are old there could be some damage or leaks that require a repair. Your home inspector can inspect your pipes as part of an actual home inspection, or they can take pictures of the pipes and send you on your way.","token_len":459,"entropy":[10.7788,4.2164,2.0593,5.9941,7.052,2.4206,9.8957,7.7304,13.1861,3.4605,6.0403,2.5866,1.0811,6.9748,5.0068,4.9565,2.8158,1.0988,3.0327,5.4032,3.9043,7.2738,0.0174,6.1879,2.6994,4.2785,1.5502,5.9815,0.8021,2.4986,8.098,1.555,5.8358,5.491,0.9422,4.3473,2.3014,6.1639,7.4607,3.5687,4.4916,6.4303,1.5677,6.9448,0.1361,4.9977,1.4428,0.9254,1.6171,4.6044,4.4829,0.1543,2.0582,6.0239,1.3325,3.8076,0.6812,3.008,7.5625,1.7573,4.9073,4.2911,3.3397,2.963,1.4393,0.1285,2.8674,0.8554,0.3922,0.3415,5.379,2.1032,3.4972,1.1116,5.9424,0.3566,3.1433,5.758,0.5848,0.6739,5.2296,3.9919,2.8178,5.4909,7.7199,3.9615,6.5048,1.8458,1.1869,3.6749,2.3643,0.2014,4.8735,2.7884,6.626,3.1011,4.1017,0.0107,1.5995,7.9941,1.9199,3.3971,2.7345,9.706,2.04,5.1236,1.3133,1.3005,2.2343,0.0456,2.1546,2.8747,0.0071,3.3159,3.0411,1.9402,2.5581,3.0498,2.0715,3.4981,1.0001,5.2503,1.5555,0.7655,4.3831,4.4606,2.393,2.1865,11.5655,4.3417,1.9704,6.9901,0.2977,5.0635,4.3036,2.2735,0.8662,7.6695,3.2295,8.131,2.8055,2.8277,4.4332,0.09,3.8379,4.338,4.1424,0.345,3.0825,7.9419,3.2248,1.1093,2.0491,1.6862,6.5873,1.1308,3.1178,3.0674,5.0079,2.3664,1.1574,4.9037,1.2877,0.1377,3.743,0.7143,1.301,5.6738,3.8192,2.7918,4.5718,1.2511,6.6076,1.6399,4.2088,0.7521,1.5413,4.6172,3.112,0.138,0.9272,1.6953,1.9773,2.7055,5.5366,3.634,1.611,2.2952,0.201,4.2136,4.8416,4.8265,2.0932,6.4469,0.7228,4.4038,5.6385,0.6547,4.0554,0.9289,2.0588,3.9281,0.4404,1.6887,0.079,2.5482,4.5908,4.8201,3.9484,6.5919,2.8847,5.8532,2.5733,2.7687,4.614,0.5855,5.5494,7.0776,2.8658,1.2564,4.713,5.0398,6.7858,8.1521,1.2141,0.7393,2.3786,5.1541,2.4543,0.3865,1.1061,0.5045,1.3626,0.8895,4.1636,2.2387,1.4441,2.8766,0.7542,1.888,0.123,0.001,6.797,1.0413,5.1534,2.3023,2.3201,0.0723,6.294,0.802,2.7707,0.7829,3.8024,2.7748,4.1229,0.4727,2.0085,2.116,0.6586,5.4487,2.3538,0.0017,0.1882,1.3161,5.0528,0.1517,0.8017,3.4913,7.2415,0.0497,0.8573,6.7996,2.2685,2.4646,5.7988,0.8419,2.2442,1.5015,3.7528,5.4024,2.3743,6.074,0.0445,3.1825,2.975,0.928,6.9982,2.9469,1.2313,8.2348,2.2779,2.5048,7.4033,0.482,0.4143,1.4969,0.88,3.6442,3.6439,5.795,0.0514,2.6577,4.8919,5.2055,1.1319,4.9668,0.0258,1.9016,1.8324,2.487,6.3728,6.6597,1.8781,3.6043,0.393,5.0608,0.8045,2.5946,0.6111,1.3991,1.4133,2.3445,5.5097,2.4045,3.8942,4.4672,0.9473,3.5332,1.8049,4.6767,6.1306,1.4274,1.2328,0.3588,4.1338,1.5096,2.7663,0.6277,1.3065,0.2166,0.0807,4.2042,2.675,4.6858,0.0016,0.1559,5.5481,5.4209,1.708,1.06,0.2556,3.5799,1.3688,2.6872,5.0149,0.119,3.2742,6.7314,1.0808,3.7655,0.7896,4.3134,1.4405,6.6073,1.6529,5.6517,4.5635,7.815,2.2322,4.7807,4.8083,3.5337,0.727,2.2868,4.5217,3.1885,2.0337,1.8448,2.0522,2.0753,0.2539,0.9408,6.2074,0.0052,6.5098,6.0833,0.2506,2.8929,5.9027,9.9357,6.3074,1.4455,2.8123,1.0654,2.3142,4.3579,5.1258,0.8782,0.666,1.4245,1.6513,3.4331,1.0165,1.9199,1.3956,1.9702,0.0119,4.4166,1.9367,4.9574,1.932,0.9114,2.1493,2.7611,0.6918,5.2378,5.5788,3.5181,0.0769,2.7307,3.8483,2.8655,4.8254,2.958,5.4037,1.7364,2.5221,0.2979,5.3005,0.9445,0.2861,2.143,3.3438,1.7941,1.1671,3.6376,3.43,0.0013,2.7822,5.7342,1.7209,0.1174,2.5333,2.6143,3.6792,0.1427,2.9648,3.1369,0.9047,0.8549,1.0957,1.2217,3.1799,2.5594,5.0265,1.92,0.3782,0.5628]}

I believe in providing children with the tools to learn and thrive, and I believe that technology can do all of it!\nAfter much discussion, brainstorming, and prayer, it\u2019s time to introduce the new and improved Homeschool Huddle App! This will be available to all students and families starting this Friday, September 8.\nA week ago I was thrilled to learn that Homeschool Huddle has been featured on the homepage of the Toms River Daily Press. After reading that piece, I felt a little more comfort knowing that my ideas are not only being shared with educators in the area, but with people from other schools on the East Coast!\nWe\u2019ve been busy planning for the next phase of our journey. In just the past 3 weeks, Homeschool Huddle has seen an explosive increase \u2014 many schools are getting involved.

The only way to stop this madness and come back to life is through a heart stopper. After he delivers the heart, the doctor has to deliver you to a different hospital. What do you do?.\nThis book was hard to start because it was about a girl, who got pregnant while on her honeymoon. She was so traumatized by this, that she couldn't see anyone.

When her husband goes to claim his bride, he was found murdered in his room with one of her lovers, who had killed her.\nAfter her death, people started to talk about her, and everyone thought she died in love and committed suicide, so why did they see her dead?\nThese days, she is going up on a high stage. You think you are in love because you fall in love. Her past is revealed. Her father is not happy with this. Now she is really going up.\nA woman, who has always liked death. A man who likes nothing except life. This book is about a romance between two lovers, who have nothing in common except their obsession with death.\nThis is one of my favorite books. This is a story about a man, who has always preferred death to life. He was raised by his father as one who is the opposite of life. He is so cold-hearted that he does not have any emotions for others. His family wants him to be married.\nBut he doesn't feel that anything can help him to stop his death obsession. He falls in love with a woman, who is totally against death, but is still a very good person with others. She falls in a romance with her husband. But he did not know the reason, why their marriage was so miserable and they almost divorced. He decides to make an agreement with her, that if she was to die, he would live in her place. Later on, she dies tragically.","token_len":460,"entropy":[6.8149,1.4456,4.3726,7.5765,1.0172,2.2683,1.8945,12.3269,1.4337,0.0,7.0957,0.1999,8.2902,1.8576,1.6487,3.2207,6.8833,5.6595,1.2359,0.005,6.6277,5.8144,1.7803,0.5907,3.7854,3.9787,1.5184,5.5482,0.4621,0.5303,3.6238,2.3515,1.0472,0.6582,1.2778,1.9661,1.4163,4.5303,5.9382,1.6503,1.1716,0.3255,0.1923,4.1182,2.8005,6.0995,13.9881,0.4797,0.5743,5.302,5.2531,6.0169,1.6547,2.6333,2.5071,2.7061,5.2364,4.4568,1.8206,4.4339,3.7636,2.3051,1.842,4.2664,1.9641,0.6922,3.9619,2.7988,0.1263,0.6706,0.451,9.5802,2.6268,6.5268,3.6064,2.7727,6.5027,0.3232,6.5764,4.7257,1.3177,1.1545,3.8108,1.9052,3.9486,2.9906,2.6026,5.2616,3.1985,3.3662,2.4331,1.6123,3.6095,0.0004,1.0097,1.5111,1.8347,3.2645,4.8582,0.0827,0.9576,2.1636,2.3792,1.3436,0.4946,3.232,0.0003,5.1084,4.7481,1.776,4.133,1.9506,2.0113,2.6776,4.1512,6.8994,2.1755,0.9741,2.5962,2.5947,3.7235,5.4367,0.1731,4.977,5.5899,4.3535,0.3719,3.0053,4.1092,2.7267,3.5026,0.3624,2.191,1.5723,4.4848,4.5591,0.2065,2.8698,2.1694,3.5522,0.4844,0.8528,0.824,0.9581,1.4641,4.4716,5.1892,3.4562,6.1658,2.8444,2.583,1.8146,7.6769,0.3164,3.6947,3.1686,0.8098,5.9058,1.1575,8.3396,1.8075,4.4705,0.5051,1.4866,4.4179,4.7017,4.4708,1.7659,1.4671,3.111,3.69,5.8667,0.5905,2.3151,4.8098,2.5457,2.1683,2.1598,4.2213,1.3656,1.5996,1.7112,3.2084,2.9292,1.9587,0.1334,5.0562,1.9139,1.1871,3.0318,0.0835,1.2888,2.8387,1.4143,4.9411,2.9322,1.0791,4.7621,2.5462,3.2751,4.0071,7.1244,0.1021,2.6969,2.819,4.0895,2.3496,2.0207,5.4677,0.8094,3.6534,0.4651,1.0235,5.688,2.9241,0.2739,3.3091,0.9415,5.7722,6.4633,2.2253,1.679,4.4957,5.0669,1.3898,4.1205,4.7861,1.7977,1.358,3.4352,0.9178,5.5318,0.7551,6.4956,0.1798,0.0022,3.1167,5.4979,6.7847,1.0927,5.4514,1.4217,2.8277,4.4834,1.141,4.7381,2.0106,1.3445,3.1324,1.3598,5.5364,1.6484,0.5831,5.8205,3.4254,2.0132,3.3278,1.3871,4.1954,4.0545,3.3598,0.7728,2.0962,3.9366,4.5146,2.6866,3.6016,3.5032,1.7055,1.242,3.3866,5.7195,6.4345,4.5947,0.3612,4.1219,3.4546,0.9448,1.0403,1.2186,8.5185,1.2685,0.7152,2.6622,1.6853,1.4421,2.3635,5.0981,0.6115,0.0028,1.7964,2.2821,4.9568,0.4379,0.7755,0.1635,0.9708,2.21,1.1313,3.2639,0.3106,1.9229,0.3385,0.8561,1.916,3.4259,0.7338,1.6278,3.0969,0.5986,1.1241,1.8659,2.3018,0.3953,1.7846,2.2433,5.8058,1.2646,1.8248,0.8706,0.4754,1.3906,3.5418,3.9166,1.8168,1.2665,2.0776,3.8811,4.4402,3.0995,4.7027,4.8041,4.5482,0.446,2.6986,0.4141,1.1076,2.193,4.2088,5.9788,3.0844,0.8794,1.8347,0.3135,2.9835,0.3728,3.3685,1.8186,3.5584,3.4603,3.5087,0.4699,2.9172,3.7306,5.019,0.752,0.4601,1.702,6.9659,1.5512,2.2332,3.5284,1.7457,2.4464,0.0011,4.8384,2.1403,6.7024,2.2227,4.0031,0.47,3.6128,5.1793,0.788,5.4256,3.8193,0.2896,0.9281,5.9798,0.3584,0.0014,0.2683,1.2903,1.6539,1.8815,0.5851,1.052,5.653,5.0393,2.1302,2.0301,1.915,3.1411,2.8081,3.0925,3.5946,3.6971,0.9482,4.8347,8.6799,0.3073,1.5627,5.482,0.1795,9.201,6.6937,0.5509,2.8158,1.408,1.1323,3.0681,2.152,6.5527,0.2703,3.2946,3.565,2.7626,3.2154,5.3018,7.1414,1.6259,1.2507,1.8545,5.7122,2.5524,2.5356,6.9298,3.3977,0.3639,2.1598,4.7572,0.2786,3.6617,3.2573,4.079,0.5378,0.5662,1.4372,2.3056,2.5514,0.9069,4.1571,1.5781,1.4296,0.8649,0.6636,0.4424,4.7935,3.0886,2.9822,3.191,1.507,6.9844,1.3891,0.2917,1.7906,3.5252,7.8807,0.9683]}

the special-tea team. a baguette division. the super-guns. the sniper team. the new move, the treadmill. the rest of the world. one guy, and a really powerful move. that is all it was, a plan that just happened to work. a great one.\nIt's been just over 40 years now since Richard Pryor sat down at the microphone for The New York Show, with the first of many appearances in one of rock and roll's most iconic venues. this new documentary presents a sweeping view through Pryor's early career, showcasing the diverse range of his performers, including fellow Harlem performers such as Al Green, and rockers like Jimi Hendrix, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Johnny Winter.The documentary also opens with archive footage captured at the Monterey Pop Music Festival in 1966 - the summer he would be discovered by the then- fledgling rock and roll studio, CBS Records - and in the early years of his solo career.\nThis comprehensive documentary takes a historical look at the formation of the British National Party ( B.N.P. ) - an anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, radical, far-right paramilitary organization which first appeared in 1932, when under the leadership of its founder and leader, William Morris, it was named the Irish Volunteers. this film will also explore the connections between the B.N.P. and the Nazi Party, as well as its role in creating the British Empire.The documentary explores the B.N.P.'s role in the Irish War of Independence, their opposition to the American occupation of Iraq, and their longstanding influence on British politics with reference to the Iraq War, and Britain's position in European affairs. and shows.\"","token_len":461,"entropy":[5.6883,6.1332,2.8826,5.0226,1.5845,13.4412,5.7261,9.1289,1.12,0.0039,1.6741,11.5886,2.1527,7.0373,3.3054,3.0976,4.4267,14.5993,7.5865,2.3023,4.8578,4.117,1.933,8.651,8.4677,3.5311,2.3417,7.4174,5.5623,5.3869,5.6137,8.121,7.3638,1.5312,4.3245,12.8497,2.9164,0.753,10.6473,1.4976,5.1308,5.754,6.9306,0.4972,1.2722,5.6838,1.0972,6.9082,2.0391,2.0634,1.532,3.9711,3.7852,2.3628,4.7175,4.3209,3.5866,1.5461,2.8576,3.7931,2.0844,4.4499,5.1402,1.4759,2.125,5.0558,1.9717,1.264,4.8047,6.0247,0.4762,0.4203,2.7776,1.4717,5.2334,11.8542,3.1853,7.1784,1.8613,5.5749,6.2909,2.5196,3.2825,0.5563,3.8071,0.1521,0.2504,1.158,3.965,7.3617,1.0159,0.3162,6.4947,2.3305,1.2492,2.4851,6.7067,2.3796,0.4524,5.5931,3.7461,3.7485,1.0502,1.4096,2.0405,4.7682,3.3988,2.714,1.982,4.4917,7.9021,1.7196,0.0437,0.0737,3.7982,2.145,4.6181,10.0123,0.0404,0.0121,0.4846,1.674,2.6681,4.3896,0.1991,0.7191,0.8656,1.3992,5.8561,0.3334,0.1396,1.5427,5.6311,8.9562,3.5795,1.6037,6.3663,0.4413,2.1249,4.5587,0.1659,0.2187,0.4241,2.56,6.6171,5.4611,2.3964,4.1204,2.8315,6.2956,5.2305,4.586,0.5294,4.5346,3.0923,2.577,4.029,3.9371,2.3244,2.868,6.1814,2.3721,4.9036,3.159,0.4402,2.0931,0.7115,4.1146,4.9358,4.5184,0.6597,3.4057,7.8477,1.2458,2.3167,5.0074,0.8387,5.8223,0.3033,4.21,1.4078,7.479,7.1574,6.2205,0.3201,3.3852,0.9491,5.3264,2.33,3.558,3.8452,0.5311,9.4009,2.0459,4.7869,2.132,4.0741,2.774,2.2822,4.3569,2.4828,6.1396,0.411,8.1212,3.2493,0.0458,0.0255,0.795,2.1267,2.4302,0.5599,6.6095,4.4598,6.1173,6.079,2.2891,7.3919,3.7493,3.8273,2.6595,0.0565,3.971,1.9458,0.8398,5.4342,1.776,6.8429,4.2078,0.0827,2.2097,7.1626,0.7417,2.7936,6.8391,7.6141,6.2561,3.2804,0.0033,5.4983,2.6845,0.3955,4.9529,5.6645,3.777,1.4211,4.7113,0.1476,0.0062,0.0001,0.6442,3.6411,6.2739,0.0714,0.0414,0.0028,3.3185,0.2622,1.0446,4.8088,7.5586,0.5042,7.1803,2.3311,2.2678,5.2468,0.5528,11.4541,0.2081,5.7913,2.1184,0.8739,8.0311,1.9459,3.3303,3.4836,1.0304,1.8631,4.0678,6.3829,2.11,5.4798,4.9138,4.2888,2.7888,7.7639,1.1947,2.0367,5.3299,1.2615,13.7109,3.0199,2.5534,0.0266,6.6249,2.4859,6.5766,2.0228,3.8867,1.5941,5.0222,1.8992,2.2545,3.0766,0.3842,0.8451,5.0283,0.1057,2.1313,4.4991,3.7801,7.8751,2.2891,3.7583,1.1792,6.0384,0.342,0.1421,1.8556,6.4602,0.3607,0.7598,7.3917,3.7668,1.3716,2.4581,9.3317,9.6331,0.0243,0.3329,0.6119,0.9769,0.8595,4.2709,3.3491,3.1948,0.0375,5.2003,2.4982,0.559,0.0092,2.7342,0.0168,1.431,6.6023,1.9039,5.5556,0.455,0.3032,5.7442,2.1384,3.3348,5.1558,3.4675,0.3322,5.8117,1.8594,2.139,7.4953,1.2189,0.6213,0.0101,5.3108,2.0859,2.9746,1.7161,0.4838,3.5245,3.5423,1.5798,1.7672,1.8705,4.8141,1.3371,7.2528,5.2677,0.5496,5.5916,3.1412,3.5984,2.765,2.5323,0.6674,6.1932,0.4105,0.856,1.1197,0.007,0.0091,0.0012,0.0007,0.2818,0.1735,0.8208,3.7109,1.2344,1.1364,2.0459,0.1686,0.0081,2.6836,3.8605,0.2018,4.4135,0.8097,3.7831,3.7545,0.8169,6.8978,1.4808,3.5581,0.6574,4.4475,0.0022,0.0041,0.0004,0.0006,0.5268,0.0004,2.3515,0.2204,0.9828,5.2042,3.4941,1.9218,0.2721,0.8776,5.2235,6.4924,0.0285,0.8983,4.2606,2.7013,0.3313,6.2019,0.3708,0.727,1.1932,7.5135,5.9926,0.7841,2.1252,0.997,6.8351,5.6303,0.0081,1.0231,8.4442,0.3186,2.499,2.5854,7.2764,0.1337,4.9492,0.8699,6.2787,1.8334,0.3988,5.5305,6.2545,10.5766]}
{"prompt":"Writing Workshop # 27 : Breaking Your Barriers # 1","text":"Writing Workshop # 27 : Breaking Your Barriers # 1 \u2013 The Facts\nA great way to break your barriers #1 is to go find out more about what you do inside your business. As you are going to do, you have to first face the fact that no person, business or even yourself is perfect. We see this in every action a person takes in life.\nFor too long, we\u2019ve been told that everything we do is perfect and by doing so, we\u2019ve allowed negativity to enter our lives. Instead of doing something new, we stick with the path we think we know is safe and we avoid stepping out of our comfort zones.\nThe only way to break that mentality is by doing actions outside of your comfort zone. No matter how old you think you are or what you might think, you can always learn something new. By doing something new, you can also break the mentality of being perfect.\nYou see, no one is perfect. We all make mistakes, especially if we are not doing something new. We do take things from our path that we feel we are supposed to but we never do them. We keep doing what we \u2018know\u2019 is right and leave all the work for someone to do it correctly for us. You see, most of the time what we believe has never been proven to be true.\nThis is a classic example of breaking your barrier. By going and finding out more, you put yourself in a position of being able to change your thoughts. As you do so, you allow the possibility to be open to possibilities that have not been given to you before and that you may be overlooking.\nDo you have a project idea that you have been wanting to work on? It might never be perfect but after asking questions, you might see that it might not be something you had considered before and instead, there might even be a way to incorporate them into a bigger plan.\nSo, ask these questions to yourself. How do you want to go about reaching your goals? How do you get there? This is a place to begin your thinking and you may be amazed to see that not only are there multiple methods, but maybe more importantly, there are methods that can get you to where you want to be.","token_len":461,"entropy":[12.2059,5.3264,9.4148,5.3574,7.853,4.8173,7.533,2.1723,4.7561,3.8814,4.1766,3.8264,8.1998,2.7067,9.0919,4.4042,2.0194,0.0465,1.614,0.6775,0.5738,8.6927,1.5179,1.3595,0.3491,3.7747,5.8091,2.5506,3.2636,0.1663,3.0484,1.6152,2.7757,6.2738,1.613,4.4193,0.725,5.0239,1.8301,3.8482,2.8894,0.7747,3.5072,2.2905,1.5096,3.9025,0.3433,5.1973,7.0211,1.1345,1.8897,0.087,5.4223,6.5719,3.4376,3.0753,0.5163,4.1058,3.5889,1.7972,3.5184,0.5549,4.7834,5.2516,1.2738,1.8915,2.9411,6.8739,5.1249,1.4342,0.29,3.2697,2.0883,0.5959,3.2688,4.6639,8.1303,0.3771,0.844,1.2293,17.4511,9.457,2.8038,0.7391,1.905,0.4998,4.2842,1.503,0.1163,0.7745,2.7953,2.1179,6.9767,2.8756,1.1437,1.1338,0.2308,5.2093,0.6895,0.7657,5.1993,8.28,0.5371,3.7279,0.3105,0.6848,0.3598,5.6271,0.5583,3.7132,2.2784,4.1474,0.8813,0.5112,7.4142,1.2216,1.992,7.291,1.2734,6.0882,2.0643,1.9022,3.6772,5.3878,0.9735,4.2572,6.2253,6.7507,3.0049,0.4774,2.1357,0.0127,2.3809,0.4168,1.0014,3.3383,3.8861,0.7842,0.3384,1.4333,3.1251,5.4905,0.163,2.2619,2.1941,7.12,3.5291,0.4589,0.7996,0.3137,0.3479,0.2985,5.163,0.4855,0.8039,5.9664,0.5267,3.101,0.1287,0.0507,2.5878,1.768,0.686,5.3124,2.2642,1.4426,1.3099,2.3092,2.2939,3.9949,2.6466,0.8313,1.585,4.7434,1.1947,1.9969,1.3613,0.4381,0.1891,1.688,4.5101,3.3461,1.7547,5.5398,1.3158,3.1911,4.9296,0.7708,0.5844,3.6141,4.4316,0.8364,4.4378,1.8702,1.1156,0.1485,0.6679,3.0655,1.0975,4.2321,0.0535,1.4138,5.3685,2.4519,0.4265,1.1913,2.2394,2.9042,2.9686,3.314,0.5205,2.1336,3.1001,6.3406,2.4714,4.0522,2.6081,7.4343,4.0579,0.9042,3.2336,2.2279,2.0304,3.8395,0.0039,6.7093,1.4809,2.5435,2.2027,3.2902,0.8956,1.5402,4.9686,2.9734,2.2917,0.136,13.5699,6.4444,4.1484,1.8402,3.2623,2.1184,1.1151,1.3129,6.7803,4.8664,1.5444,4.1273,3.944,4.1152,5.182,0.6255,3.0206,7.0199,5.5373,0.9428,0.184,4.8812,1.9379,0.3361,4.981,0.8736,1.5787,0.2412,4.7335,0.7141,4.8661,5.6862,4.4173,0.7094,3.9916,1.7574,0.3734,0.5902,0.9237,1.1489,3.2421,0.6599,3.1324,6.0152,0.5739,0.2568,4.9191,0.7382,1.374,0.5229,4.7683,4.0997,4.6819,2.8979,0.2722,1.0399,1.9843,0.2118,6.9435,0.5113,0.5418,0.9193,1.5963,3.1005,2.0464,2.1423,0.0054,3.5556,1.1355,4.9709,2.3959,4.5257,0.7965,2.63,1.5495,0.037,0.2627,4.8387,2.0047,6.236,1.808,2.9871,3.7603,0.7501,6.3334,1.6239,3.5915,1.8612,0.4136,4.7346,0.6331,0.0375,1.7893,2.6783,3.0173,1.2316,2.7719,2.292,7.3559,0.6135,0.7225,4.834,1.592,2.496,1.3702,5.5385,5.6606,1.1726,0.3427,3.0954,1.5915,3.5263,0.0755,2.5154,0.0128,2.2589,3.6932,3.0017,5.9431,1.3601,5.0964,1.4173,5.8151,6.0247,3.9365,1.302,0.794,3.2967,4.0029,1.9397,1.3864,2.5869,2.8148,0.3823,4.1497,0.5944,3.2911,2.649,1.8359,2.7563,5.2881,2.4516,4.5873,1.8442,5.1439,0.0372,1.3146,3.2289,0.7634,4.7268,6.1152,0.2878,3.3396,3.8552,2.0069,0.4781,0.9312,4.2839,1.2809,6.2125,6.0262,0.2385,2.3523,1.4343,2.009,3.7839,1.0977,0.0616,4.5292,0.2723,3.3417,0.0557,5.8006,0.8148,1.1562,0.4709,1.5138,0.408,0.0058,4.4264,2.1738,0.3689,4.9391,0.5652,1.8891,5.9492,1.2959,2.8948,2.9638,5.313,2.2496,3.3567,3.1739,2.2527,4.6769,2.5267,1.3679,1.7476,4.6875,0.3982,1.5993,1.8351,5.6934,5.4129,3.0226,0.2956,7.314,4.8414,3.1546,0.196,1.4328,0.5267,3.9539,0.6194,2.7481,4.7875,0.3718,2.8691,1.6277,0.0207,0.8173,0.0715,0.5981,0.4675]}

Not only do they help feed Britain\u2019s wartime troops, but with their wartime success comes an increasing range of their products : from chocolates to biscuits and even the famous Wonka flavoured coffee, a real treat for those soldiers on active service. Now even the WW1 soldiers will want a shot of Wonka!\nThe Wonka Candle Company has a line of chocolate scented candles, all smelling of delicious Wonka flavours - Chocolate Melody, Chocolate Mint, Chocolate Chocolate, Sour Apple, Warm and Sweet Milk, Fruit Jelly, Chocolate Ice Cream and Tobacco. Sold as a set of two, they were first marketed as a Christmas gift in 1915. It\u2019s not clear whether these were original production candles or a copy, as only one of the two candles comes with a clear lid.\nThe candle was relicensed to a US chocolate factory who produced more than 300 million liters for US troops. These candles would last up to seven months if lit up once per day. Sold with a paper clip, they were given to soldiers who travelled overseas, ensuring they could use the candle to decorate their beds as the war was winding down. The candles are made today as a commercial venture by a company in Colorado, the Wonka candle company, which sells about 6 million of them per year for $ 4 each - in the USA! The original product is kept out of production, and has now been licensed to a private company in Colorado. This company has only just produced their first batch of Wonka flavoured candles, under license to The Chocolate Melody company.\nBorn November 25, 1925.

{"prompt":"You are God ( or a god ) . Tell me a story or give me commentary on an event .","text":"You are God ( or a god ). Tell me a story or give me commentary on an event. I love God, Jesus, family, friends, animals, music, movies, etc... There could be an answer for everything. I want to be a God. I try to follow my conscience, I try to follow Jesus the way he lives, but I am not perfect and I can be better.\nI hope you can help us to understand how these things work. You have a nice spirit, but unfortunately it is not used in the right way. Sorry for the criticism; but I also need help.\nThe story in the Torah of Moses and the burning bush is the first story in scripture that is about God. The same is true about the story of Jesus on the cross.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t say any more about the burning bush ( unless you think that Jesus saw a woman in the bush ). The story of Moses is less clear about his relationship to God. That\u2019s true about any story in scripture that is about a person about a God or something outside of the realm of man\u2019s experience. We are unable to know more about God. That\u2019s why God is the only way for us to talk about God.\nIt would be good to think about the burning bush stories, too, after people think about the more recent stories in scripture \u2014 like how Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees and Isaac was still old. The burning bush story is not about Abraham, the story is about God ; it shows the desire to know God and show Abraham that God was ready to show his love to him by making him father of many nations.\nYou think that Abraham had a son named Isaac after Isaac was born? That wasn\u2019t at all obvious to Abraham. If Abraham was talking about himself, it was more obvious, but the father of many nations was a way of talking about God.\nWe are always speaking about God, because we can only think about God, and that\u2019s a problem because we only really think about God in a spiritual way. The story in the Torah is good enough for our spiritual growth. But when we talk about other things, that\u2019s when we get into more trouble.","token_len":461,"entropy":[3.8828,9.7401,6.409,10.137,4.0663,2.702,2.3723,7.8494,1.0972,4.4068,2.1935,3.406,5.2759,0.3222,10.0646,1.548,3.5826,2.1107,1.3426,2.3927,4.4602,4.0731,2.2122,6.6982,0.9415,7.5507,0.361,1.8214,0.4471,5.4223,0.4374,3.5815,0.3439,3.119,0.3413,2.9288,3.947,5.6892,6.946,0.1134,4.3311,5.4963,2.2982,3.5909,1.0243,2.2926,2.8669,0.4394,2.08,1.9087,2.875,1.458,1.5038,6.3802,0.3171,4.2402,1.7014,3.3675,1.8508,2.5337,1.1886,0.1065,2.3392,4.7876,6.3156,0.4661,2.5201,5.3714,1.5879,2.6271,0.6926,2.264,0.9714,3.8627,2.8334,0.5631,3.1928,2.8496,4.7597,0.88,2.4869,3.9591,4.0646,0.8984,3.2344,2.8925,3.6263,2.9373,2.8261,2.6927,5.2942,2.3965,1.675,0.8082,3.8236,2.8149,2.4843,5.8637,7.3415,1.1857,2.3568,6.4679,2.5597,1.3526,1.3061,7.5979,2.5273,1.374,2.1243,0.2542,0.3757,8.1967,1.3749,1.0242,7.6019,6.1721,3.1846,1.2111,5.2245,4.6668,3.436,1.3395,1.3616,3.7389,4.9098,4.5918,1.8567,6.6749,3.9603,3.5658,2.3564,1.466,8.7313,2.2214,1.5479,2.8622,4.0633,3.7785,1.7327,7.058,1.7359,2.8969,4.183,1.6991,1.1473,1.8972,6.3791,2.0965,0.1793,3.3528,0.8896,1.9608,0.3451,2.1437,5.606,0.5737,0.7928,0.4286,2.0901,4.8942,2.0824,1.3463,4.5669,15.4958,7.3144,1.0141,4.1424,5.7486,1.6912,0.4615,1.7021,3.4179,0.0333,4.552,8.0714,1.0338,3.6802,1.8095,4.073,6.4198,3.0668,6.1374,2.5448,0.569,1.2102,3.7756,2.457,1.3132,2.5194,2.4836,1.8187,6.2298,5.0068,1.7727,3.9938,3.5514,1.4759,1.1482,1.0337,4.8257,8.1662,0.2453,0.7492,3.9952,3.024,5.2305,3.6204,3.3579,1.0878,2.8956,1.4428,0.3185,3.1944,2.2577,7.5828,3.1744,3.5223,2.9353,4.5497,7.1069,0.3742,1.4776,4.2955,0.0115,5.7513,2.6156,0.2184,3.8976,4.5254,0.3938,4.3198,2.1483,6.748,0.0429,2.4543,4.6611,0.2432,1.848,2.7559,3.8403,1.1363,0.0267,0.0568,2.296,3.1836,1.4502,3.2991,1.2438,2.6855,3.1488,0.5414,0.179,7.0203,0.2303,1.1525,0.685,0.9735,3.8138,3.985,0.419,3.0341,1.1098,4.9668,1.1863,1.8203,3.9759,0.0067,5.0765,2.9148,3.8754,1.315,6.8736,6.2681,3.8784,0.3025,1.9652,6.4266,2.825,1.8641,2.4714,2.3938,8.0992,3.2404,5.0101,4.9942,6.8233,9.6093,5.5287,2.3492,6.7142,0.9956,0.9373,1.5962,6.0901,3.2602,5.0409,9.2806,1.8377,3.0799,1.9303,0.008,1.3301,1.1907,2.5278,1.2686,1.904,2.2522,3.5394,3.3355,1.9008,0.1523,1.7571,8.9271,0.6859,7.0528,2.526,6.2011,1.3146,3.2354,3.2188,2.0634,5.2443,6.8413,2.0333,2.0482,2.666,6.8728,0.3928,4.3859,2.0549,1.4429,1.4025,1.0778,5.9632,3.653,0.6313,6.268,2.1725,4.5551,5.4836,0.5713,0.9359,4.4771,5.1645,1.2731,3.5753,3.2663,1.6356,4.615,3.2038,1.4613,4.5952,4.6821,6.576,1.4727,0.7281,2.3236,5.2849,1.83,0.5246,0.0533,6.5303,0.0426,5.4288,2.5328,2.096,0.7731,3.912,2.4335,2.267,5.5074,0.1618,4.841,0.8614,2.7541,1.7282,4.0941,1.3486,4.4315,1.5275,2.5169,5.8851,1.45,1.1456,0.3466,1.5712,3.4823,6.7088,1.3381,4.1728,0.2034,1.2432,0.605,1.3626,4.1021,1.9897,5.5531,4.5951,0.4986,1.2385,1.7129,3.8506,1.2614,3.5501,4.5726,3.519,0.465,0.9376,3.3652,1.4105,2.3646,1.5483,0.0279,0.0567,3.2669,4.3546,3.2884,1.1038,4.7061,4.4396,2.6693,0.1067,0.3719,2.5649,2.5632,4.233,1.0434,0.3071,2.7405,3.3511,2.4257,0.262,1.3113,1.8356,8.1262,3.6654,1.3889,4.0836,2.2802,5.322,0.9722,2.2086,3.4856,0.579,1.4542,0.0418,4.6019,1.1716,0.603,3.8621,1.154,0.0149,0.0534,5.4444,0.2285,4.2495,2.1286,4.965,3.8782,0.768]}
{"prompt":"One day , you and four people come across a stone , that connects all of your souls . Every hurt one of you feel , the rest feel ; every good thing affects all the rest . How does that affect you all over the years ?","text":"One day, you and four people come across a stone, that connects all of your souls. Every hurt one of you feel, the rest feel ; every good thing affects all the rest. How does that affect you all over the years? You all feel like the person who broke your heart, but if you were to do the same back, they might be willing. You become the person who is all in, with no worries. The person who is the same for everyone. The person who is happy for no reason. But, that kind of feeling, might not last forever. A person might come into your life, with the same pain you were having. Maybe, they could see your feelings but not your pain. You will be more interested in what they say over you, then what you say. In a way, you don\u2019t want to lose the person you are with. You think you will be happy, after you get over this feeling. Then, you start to meet someone else, who can be the person you can\u2019t live without. And, there you go with all your pain back there. You don\u2019t think about hurting them, but they always do. You don\u2019t think about losing them, but you always do. You don\u2019t think about getting hurt again, but you are.\nSo, this is one of the best ways to end on a good note I have seen in a while. The way you end things can end the beginning in the best way. Always follow your heart. It will lead you to someone, who loves you too much, so much, even if you don\u2019t know him yet. You might be on a boat ; and someone comes in and tells you to save yourself. Then, they drag you ashore and save you from dying.

He then takes an egg out of a bag, smashes it on the ground and shoots himself in the head. Write the story behind this. Why kill yourself?\nI just have to go to the internet and google some of the more popular keywords that are being talked about at the moment in regards to what people are doing to get their hair or skin in better condition. I have to admit though, I am surprised by the results. It really seems like most people are actually using natural products if you search on the internet. I would like to think because its natural it is more gentle and so on.\nPersonally I have to say I think that for the cost, I don't need to go that far and search for the perfect product. I don't really use many products on my body (maybe 2 or 3 a month), but when I do I have a few I use. I like to use natural products as they can be bought fairly easily by most people compared to the price of other products that is advertised. One of these products I use is a clay mask I bought from naturalwell. This helps remove any impurities\/ dirt from my skin easily.\nThere are other natural products like ointments that I have used that work wonders. Some are really expensive, but I have seen other products that cost \u00a38.99. For that price, I think it is really good. When I say products to get your skin\/hair better, I include makeup too because it is not just your diet that can help your skin, but also what you are putting on it.\nIt really can help to go to a store that sells natural products and browse for anything you want. My favourite store to go to is eco friendly store. It has everything and you pretty much know what you're getting. If you are a person who wants to use natural products as much as possible, then I really recommend using eco friendly. They really do a lot of natural products for you and at the cheapest price around.\nA bit later this week I will post a couple of photos of my hair and face so that you can see what it's like to use natural hair products.","token_len":463,"entropy":[7.3022,3.3171,5.271,2.7571,0.9759,2.5005,2.7072,4.8306,1.5766,2.3774,2.3713,2.4165,0.8446,1.1273,5.2693,7.9548,9.5988,2.0124,8.1005,1.3412,0.5409,0.1944,0.4836,2.0127,4.4268,3.9156,5.3971,5.4703,2.4893,0.3844,3.2748,2.7057,2.1402,7.1175,0.5995,0.26,2.6596,0.5395,0.494,0.7931,6.3543,5.1525,0.8642,0.0771,0.9221,0.4542,12.2256,3.2535,1.8944,5.3357,1.4358,2.8745,6.5655,7.3463,1.3888,0.8738,1.7068,6.0765,5.37,4.4639,0.8665,3.3382,2.79,1.5554,5.3771,0.8241,4.4478,4.1371,2.0849,0.4866,3.7278,2.8251,8.9044,3.4585,2.4486,2.9271,4.5726,0.0235,4.7553,1.3474,0.3796,4.2783,3.5717,0.0295,4.5028,4.2688,0.984,1.9088,1.5695,3.9471,2.5604,5.1646,4.5881,3.4205,4.484,3.5009,1.3739,0.4726,2.0077,2.5833,2.7107,4.1474,3.4618,1.0811,0.9275,2.1858,4.8008,2.4331,1.072,4.689,0.9404,3.0656,4.0702,2.7027,0.9402,4.4983,0.8532,1.2109,3.9535,3.8575,5.879,2.0902,6.7931,1.5364,5.792,3.5968,1.2089,0.5724,0.8728,1.7015,3.3136,2.8142,0.0719,2.5943,6.8503,6.7535,4.2659,2.819,1.5685,3.1095,7.5567,1.3861,5.1107,4.6564,0.763,2.2902,6.9354,0.6542,2.5341,3.5064,0.9023,1.6687,3.0512,1.7151,4.9842,2.0758,7.4602,3.2107,2.089,3.7882,0.0018,4.0524,0.8248,2.3707,4.6111,0.2781,2.8419,7.7089,0.6953,2.729,4.1786,1.4418,1.0177,1.1082,3.3769,0.0013,2.9812,3.6219,4.7898,1.5945,3.5423,1.9857,2.149,4.6432,5.2196,4.3155,1.5347,0.1142,3.2573,2.6986,2.5582,0.8565,3.737,0.2917,0.976,1.1879,3.5795,2.1017,2.1548,4.4363,2.2982,1.8351,1.1428,3.618,1.1705,1.6968,3.0113,1.0062,3.4064,2.6046,3.8649,1.5771,6.23,6.0253,2.4524,4.0414,2.5148,0.6805,8.4819,0.0407,1.9363,4.4488,1.2408,4.0713,0.9932,3.2999,5.3299,6.899,1.1624,5.2085,0.9036,4.6122,0.7567,1.2536,1.7516,0.6951,2.888,7.4017,4.1987,4.0715,1.6412,1.3215,7.9019,12.2038,0.7785,3.7255,5.2988,4.1365,2.393,5.3604,0.0016,6.0809,6.4184,1.7477,0.3544,0.5593,6.5352,0.5763,2.1505,4.5606,0.6787,3.1155,2.359,0.2706,4.0107,5.2488,1.1997,1.638,1.8895,1.196,1.9836,1.5808,2.5394,3.8012,3.3704,1.5224,4.0663,2.1565,3.5321,4.4672,1.6142,1.2269,1.5128,2.1672,3.7958,4.4642,2.2608,0.5527,3.001,7.1672,4.6336,2.2578,2.0711,1.8251,3.7108,4.3752,1.1614,1.7719,0.7693,2.7343,1.8446,0.8762,3.8446,3.2204,0.9245,5.0813,0.5907,4.8233,6.7237,4.6464,3.0699,3.5382,2.1722,7.3972,0.8516,3.4427,1.1627,0.6032,7.006,8.0981,4.7618,3.2973,1.1602,1.0991,3.7744,3.1828,5.3993,9.1465,2.4735,3.4663,2.052,2.5149,0.5205,2.5287,0.9835,1.4762,4.3195,1.1622,1.9707,4.8281,1.3327,3.2574,0.4205,1.5337,4.0695,3.505,4.2896,1.4456,2.0464,4.5998,1.4684,1.5861,4.0262,2.4971,1.2353,1.7031,0.385,1.4456,7.107,1.5188,6.1084,2.0274,2.3299,1.0761,4.7908,2.6059,4.426,3.7302,1.5545,0.2143,0.4441,7.9062,5.4113,3.5368,1.5854,2.6193,1.5716,3.8518,5.1277,3.1724,8.2333,0.0234,2.8234,0.5811,0.6951,2.669,0.581,1.1417,3.1652,0.1877,1.613,2.8983,3.5845,0.9289,2.6203,0.3539,3.7987,1.0544,0.2036,4.5706,2.1017,0.099,0.3577,0.6851,1.4694,1.9704,3.7202,0.4352,3.694,2.6907,0.814,1.8912,2.3986,4.2377,1.6485,2.7888,3.7267,0.5003,5.4105,0.6324,2.642,0.9344,1.8241,5.6605,1.2077,5.8984,0.9326,6.3929,1.119,1.0095,4.5453,4.9028,4.2565,6.108,1.3476,0.5938,1.6392,2.6599,1.3001,4.7153,0.2054,2.687,0.7637,0.9992,2.0248,1.6787,3.0255,4.0429,1.8295,0.5929,0.4055,0.5118,1.6069,2.3193,3.4043,0.5914,0.7529,3.09,1.1115,2.7841,1.1936,0.4757]}
{"prompt":"The shortest fantasy story that ends with the hero dying that you can write","text":"The shortest fantasy story that ends with the hero dying that you can write (because its such a story, and you want them to end as such). Can you do it using nothing but the rules of the game?\nI suppose I could write one like that using two tables, one for the players and one for the hero and writing my own rules and story for the campaign. The problem with doing this the way I want is that the rules to the players would take the first page or so, and I am pretty sure the players, in their reading of the fantasy, will assume its part of the story and not the rules for the campaign. So, they may not give much attention to it.\nThanks to anyone that can help, this sounds like an impossible job but I have to work on it for a class! Thanks in advance :)\nI suppose I could probably get something going with these rules, but it'd be hard and might take more than a day to get it done. Perhaps there is a more efficient way to do it, like a different type of magic item?\nActually, I could use about six sheets to lay out the story of the campaign, a few character sheets, the other tables for combat and other systems, the map of the dungeon, etc...\nNow that's an interesting idea. I didn't think of doing a scenario in a game. I think a scenario is more about the story, while a set of rules could be for system mechanics. My thinking is that I need to find the right balance in story versus mechanics in order to keep the two separate without confusing the players. But your thoughts are helpful to me.\nI thought your rules for the scenario were good. It made for easier character creation, but that might be down to my lack of experience writing scenarios.\nThank you, I have enjoyed learning from these different views. There will be a little more time to write the scenario before the end of the day.\nIf you want to do this, use a table as a separate sheet for the magic items. Use the character sheet, but have a blank row (or column) for a magic item. Write down how many spell points the person has, how many mana points, etc. etc, and then use the table to create the spell.","token_len":465,"entropy":[11.5233,11.3654,4.4334,3.3211,6.0516,0.9246,1.96,3.5813,2.7873,7.1792,3.413,1.004,2.9775,5.0313,4.7293,5.787,5.8476,0.2641,5.8513,2.3235,2.6733,1.8828,2.7508,5.4706,0.1359,3.2967,4.0402,5.0131,1.8211,7.382,1.4442,3.1625,1.6111,6.7613,7.2866,0.8168,2.0699,5.0289,2.3375,0.959,0.804,0.7772,1.6892,7.0323,5.2377,1.8631,1.4142,1.9235,3.3577,4.0541,1.0736,6.1273,6.0175,5.3373,1.3715,2.2214,0.9477,1.4412,4.8789,0.6493,0.1521,0.0798,0.1898,5.6147,3.0963,8.5333,5.2761,1.2241,1.148,3.8617,5.5037,3.6426,1.3403,7.2529,0.6705,3.2713,4.2743,1.5984,4.3633,1.1425,7.4086,1.1911,0.6333,1.9808,0.967,0.2652,1.8749,1.5027,6.2978,1.8872,2.8997,3.686,4.9204,3.446,4.7221,3.8012,5.6878,1.4014,1.758,0.984,2.6766,4.3686,4.2878,0.8317,2.0452,2.5893,5.7833,3.6205,2.4461,7.14,1.6241,0.3741,6.1789,1.3423,2.0672,4.9886,6.108,6.707,0.8845,0.2043,0.8237,2.3035,2.0429,1.7616,1.6973,3.9516,0.5028,2.1138,0.3523,2.2828,2.1881,4.4164,3.575,2.0381,5.8725,3.4182,3.1227,0.155,2.1575,1.9883,1.4911,6.7044,2.0278,6.2403,3.0272,2.9216,0.7177,3.0047,4.5827,6.1541,1.0344,2.7115,5.6438,5.0536,4.22,1.0037,2.536,2.4528,6.0558,1.0216,0.8147,3.1602,1.2943,9.2965,5.3394,3.7018,5.1185,0.0197,4.7301,0.935,2.2858,5.2716,1.1049,0.4097,5.0145,3.4517,3.8611,6.1805,1.5443,4.2326,1.1316,1.6465,0.8057,2.964,4.2026,0.558,2.9989,4.318,4.6892,1.2869,3.5046,1.2376,0.6365,2.7367,1.2567,1.9647,2.2417,1.5394,0.4403,5.781,4.0114,1.5414,1.0433,4.2281,3.1189,0.1939,1.0584,0.9248,0.7321,1.4224,2.4332,2.4458,5.2176,3.6031,0.0338,4.1058,3.8175,2.3291,1.0142,5.5279,0.4542,1.0399,3.3746,2.4169,8.2204,5.1464,4.1295,3.8345,5.8308,1.0115,1.0566,3.0279,3.0109,0.7326,2.6182,1.371,4.9263,2.5335,9.0009,0.2924,1.282,4.2317,5.1765,5.4676,2.0118,6.7505,1.2914,3.7095,7.3533,1.3892,2.8043,6.4363,2.2406,0.3788,3.3209,0.8404,2.1892,3.053,2.0166,5.3735,2.2362,2.7433,3.6058,1.453,0.6751,1.2249,1.8019,5.4497,0.0007,1.9448,2.0945,4.0281,2.1185,5.5414,3.3372,2.3302,3.9143,2.9923,1.2736,2.0706,3.5098,1.6418,1.6291,3.9885,3.0107,2.0093,2.7091,1.9025,5.8998,1.1405,4.8556,0.2763,0.3114,3.2895,0.6081,3.7583,9.2194,4.4716,1.279,5.2429,5.2587,0.6676,0.4973,3.0581,3.6144,0.7534,4.2292,2.732,1.5903,2.2446,3.5676,5.6751,6.6813,3.94,3.307,2.4819,0.1145,3.7981,0.7775,4.9137,3.748,6.0689,4.5072,0.8239,0.8577,0.3948,4.3578,7.3868,5.8342,1.6594,5.3646,2.9807,0.3149,1.0902,1.0195,1.8794,4.705,5.8662,4.5356,2.3399,1.2127,4.2705,1.6745,3.1185,1.7567,3.4683,4.8586,3.1955,6.2888,5.1272,1.2846,1.2238,1.8336,3.9986,3.7354,1.0543,6.5033,0.033,3.2831,3.8282,0.0059,1.9116,4.3403,3.2735,0.934,1.6416,4.7873,0.0316,2.5736,3.1549,3.6197,5.4945,5.6686,2.4798,5.2059,6.7578,6.6063,0.7925,5.0468,4.0739,0.4065,1.8736,5.4383,0.9589,3.5018,1.3222,1.5323,2.3412,2.1291,3.5307,1.5563,2.196,0.1963,0.3882,4.2567,1.3939,1.3354,3.782,0.6454,2.4841,0.3558,3.6014,2.5687,1.2943,5.9112,2.8623,5.1984,4.477,1.5715,6.8806,4.4179,2.1216,1.0314,5.6815,1.2288,1.4321,5.0494,1.6045,5.3131,0.561,3.1008,3.0937,4.6792,1.4952,4.042,7.4833,4.4552,2.4826,2.8849,0.5737,1.1089,4.1031,2.6181,0.1019,0.9356,4.8365,3.3005,3.6264,1.0297,4.5129,1.9086,2.6405,5.1151,0.9849,1.4221,1.2411,0.323,5.3966,1.0417,3.1845,2.4964,0.4216,5.2977,3.7747,1.1574,1.861,2.3814,1.2676,2.8357,1.0118,2.4477,1.4019,3.2711,2.4528]}

Example : a man who starved to death will live in a heaven of food. A man who died of a disease that is life threatening will live with that disease to the end of his life. Therefore a Heaven, for us, is nothing like paradise. We know, we can only make a Heaven with our love and mercy. We can not make it like paradise with only money or political position, but it can happen with any other way. Heaven does not come by chance ; it comes as you have already lived the life that you deserve ; the life that gives you joy and peace and you love your people with your heart and soul. To get to this Heaven, let us try to walk in the Path of Love for our brothers and sisters ; the God of Love, Love God, Love all people everywhere, help us every day to understand with our hearts that we need to give to our brothers and sisters ; without them, this life will pass unnoticed ; it is our responsibility to work for the happiness and happiness of our people.\nIf you are a woman in Uganda, we offer you this beautiful piece of advice : let me just tell you this ; it does not matter how many friends you have, all it matters is who you love and who loves you. The beauty of God is that nobody will take it away from anyone. You are beautiful with your family, your children.\nEvery woman should see this video ; it is important for the women to come together and start to organize ; I think that if everyone put it to a vote ( in this case through their smartphones ) it could be a challenge for each person to put more of their own money, not just to send, but also to manage and invest it. It really looks like a dream, but I believe that it will happen.\nThis video was recorded at a private party. At the end, there was a video projection but we will not share the video just yet ; it will be shared in a few days ; but we want to give a little speech.\nFirst, let us see our beautiful children, then let us give thanks for our lives, then let us express our love to each other, and then let us say a special prayer to God.","token_len":465,"entropy":[9.8594,7.2186,0.0007,9.5018,0.345,6.2963,6.31,2.7611,8.16,1.153,0.6861,6.6246,2.5431,9.5937,1.4195,10.612,5.7122,4.2031,2.8158,2.1195,8.0517,1.2048,0.0043,5.0574,4.7642,3.4394,1.6461,4.3483,3.4136,3.9256,1.4441,3.6676,0.9071,0.2905,2.3095,3.3721,2.8899,2.4169,3.6504,3.8241,5.096,1.6283,0.7073,0.804,4.8087,4.0162,0.2515,5.1718,1.5466,1.6367,1.8298,0.2706,0.127,0.1642,4.9357,3.5818,5.7346,4.681,4.6181,5.3215,0.6955,0.4243,5.3346,3.1275,6.664,0.5741,3.877,4.3742,3.8922,4.1162,3.3084,5.1087,4.9225,2.6708,0.4598,3.5471,2.0014,5.1409,1.3947,3.8564,0.6148,2.7898,1.5166,3.6651,1.8047,3.3464,4.6317,2.3214,2.5787,6.5534,6.4693,2.1059,7.5327,6.3189,2.1111,1.025,3.9187,2.6923,6.6115,2.28,4.1887,3.6886,3.0878,1.0814,3.3901,4.0834,0.0897,3.8463,3.9742,3.3669,7.0908,0.7242,0.6038,4.8544,4.6714,3.2067,4.0178,5.0496,4.2983,1.2612,2.5498,0.6625,4.1432,5.2341,3.5071,1.5161,0.6888,5.2034,0.3333,3.325,1.1152,2.2561,2.477,5.0902,3.5764,1.909,3.9193,3.4519,2.2487,0.4406,1.1533,2.4243,0.4406,4.8295,4.9343,2.371,3.5119,1.7114,0.8478,4.9651,0.6317,4.6456,0.6316,6.4175,1.9529,1.3976,6.1746,0.6548,3.3605,5.3763,2.6099,3.6744,0.3932,0.037,3.452,3.4428,5.598,1.249,2.9661,1.9569,5.5442,5.3671,1.1776,1.5887,4.625,3.9261,5.5956,1.5367,6.9712,1.5655,4.5978,0.7612,1.7011,5.297,5.6135,1.6632,1.3553,2.452,1.4247,4.4042,0.9123,3.9109,2.4926,2.3427,1.0167,0.128,0.0085,5.1324,7.1562,3.9739,1.0838,3.9107,2.4953,1.7851,5.8354,6.9772,3.9667,2.8333,2.206,3.4937,3.4484,0.3016,5.6786,1.593,1.759,3.2188,2.352,2.3729,0.0962,1.2536,2.5215,0.9329,2.6856,7.0469,1.0588,1.8601,2.0546,5.1574,3.5319,10.581,0.6023,4.0431,4.2553,0.46,3.099,4.2524,5.931,0.0918,1.2247,1.4556,5.0829,3.2816,4.6999,1.801,0.0223,2.7754,4.0647,3.5518,4.2859,0.0752,1.1121,1.6787,2.0542,6.0545,0.3311,0.1314,1.1754,5.6955,5.5599,1.181,0.3845,4.5764,0.2996,3.4801,1.4797,1.8793,3.953,0.2012,0.5779,3.3958,5.5964,0.2424,2.7388,0.9727,1.5345,6.3735,2.7005,4.5162,2.2115,0.9339,0.6449,6.8756,0.896,3.1235,1.9125,5.4372,5.4701,1.4494,3.6004,0.9282,1.3488,2.6845,3.3784,4.2588,5.642,2.6098,2.8967,5.3498,3.0294,5.7158,4.3638,2.099,0.8744,4.0196,1.5711,3.4102,2.9712,1.1402,5.6238,3.1503,1.1044,5.1648,2.2181,6.579,6.5304,3.7662,3.8001,1.8684,2.7069,4.4659,6.2113,4.168,3.8785,2.3116,1.3896,5.6796,7.0348,2.6832,0.9173,6.9654,4.0655,7.9658,1.3076,2.1602,2.6673,1.9574,1.755,8.3687,1.1577,5.108,4.0093,1.1652,4.2031,5.6566,3.7114,0.7895,2.1995,1.8138,3.8784,5.0412,0.9808,2.4382,4.5621,4.8613,0.2315,2.4477,0.3275,8.1479,3.4306,5.4895,2.7978,1.2228,3.1375,5.2248,6.0606,0.4897,1.4969,3.883,2.4446,1.3311,2.3034,3.091,0.6612,2.0192,1.3993,2.5996,0.9942,1.0323,3.3259,1.3869,2.3749,3.3009,2.6738,2.2759,4.7956,3.8215,3.2657,5.8619,0.8196,1.1806,2.1697,3.4142,1.5576,0.6263,4.21,8.7149,6.6835,3.2874,3.4826,1.5121,3.9135,2.0028,0.772,7.1451,1.1477,3.6041,2.1783,1.5459,0.8673,4.1383,2.5079,2.1966,1.5402,0.9098,4.316,3.2328,2.5746,3.1787,0.2641,2.8044,2.4808,2.7495,7.7344,2.8066,1.1674,5.1174,1.3694,1.3454,1.0746,4.3981,3.9864,4.9918,4.1594,2.1904,5.606,1.1854,0.369,3.7636,4.4868,1.5331,1.8052,4.1984,2.1478,2.4712,0.5587,0.1211,5.5097,0.4235,1.1682,2.2355,1.9714,0.1242,2.0354,1.9388,1.6621,0.5377,0.2293,3.2482,3.205,4.9001,1.6103,1.8383,0.9109,1.7376]}
{"prompt":"The villain defeats the hero but the world turns out to be a better place because of his twisted views .","text":"The villain defeats the hero but the world turns out to be a better place because of his twisted views. It turns out the man has a point though his reasoning was flawed. If we take that logic of the show and apply it to the real world we will never have peace. It will never be able to happen and this world is the one who is fighting for the peace.\nIt is not just the US. India has also got an opportunity to get into the war against the terrorists that are causing a lot of loss and suffering to innocent people.\nA very dangerous part of Islam is \u2018terrorism\u2019. Terrorism is the most destructive force that man has produced. No amount of hatred and revenge for the killing of innocent people is justified. Those who killed and maimed innocents are not human. This was the message of Islam, but it is one which is largely lost now. The terrorists are not fighting for any particular ideology. They are not fighting to bring peace to the world or create some paradise in the next world. They are not fighting to liberate any area that is under foreign occupation. They are only fighting for death and destruction, for their own interest. Such is the nature of a terrorist organization.\nIf the Muslim community, to be strong, will allow their religious values to dominate their minds, their hearts and their actions, they will not have any fear of killing and maiming other innocent people in their defense. If they are afraid of making mistakes, if they are afraid of losing the respect of their fellow Muslims, then they should stop terrorism from their ranks. They should not think that it is one of these actions that will make them strong, but it will weaken the Muslim people. They must realize that terrorism has brought nothing good to the world, and that it is a great threat to human welfare.\nWhen is all this going to end? When the leaders around the world will show common sense enough to see that the only way to get peace, is to bring the world\u2019s leaders to one table, and tell them that the only way forward, is to work together for common goals, and to give the terrorists no chance. The only way forward is for the US to support a campaign against terrorism that is global, and for the world to unite against it.","token_len":466,"entropy":[10.9004,11.4906,1.1867,2.8098,4.4313,2.2285,4.5104,4.8803,4.1698,0.2097,0.047,1.381,3.3629,0.0454,3.8818,1.0391,2.9835,7.8589,6.2612,1.4442,3.8209,3.6741,0.0157,2.5195,4.7976,3.0648,1.6826,5.4793,5.1842,7.2542,6.0249,3.0949,3.0116,0.8319,4.7908,3.303,3.2928,3.6883,4.7025,3.8987,1.6716,5.8247,1.7601,3.1022,0.0807,0.1226,1.0522,2.8385,0.1434,2.5438,2.9386,5.1432,3.0374,6.7606,1.0784,3.0645,3.5152,2.0551,0.9861,4.1505,0.0074,5.26,3.102,4.2871,3.666,1.3945,3.5419,2.5969,4.9231,2.4064,4.4375,1.4254,2.7639,2.6754,1.2589,1.3573,6.682,1.3655,2.7867,2.5562,1.5329,5.9189,2.9067,6.8829,1.712,3.2726,4.6445,3.2426,4.7671,0.3967,3.8497,2.9626,0.8634,2.3197,3.1234,2.0469,3.6217,3.7421,1.7036,5.403,3.5726,0.6326,0.0209,6.3587,2.3012,1.3304,2.5452,4.4678,0.364,0.7797,2.3468,4.5074,4.5986,4.8666,5.4988,0.1146,5.4677,0.4919,13.7705,8.0146,6.8285,1.9589,7.9725,1.4636,3.1714,0.5944,2.014,3.2486,3.2376,2.7661,1.591,5.9459,1.1483,7.0049,1.3172,5.5408,4.3923,0.0043,5.9104,1.8739,5.4023,4.7076,1.9215,3.9487,0.0983,0.8972,0.198,2.052,6.687,0.9144,5.9623,0.6041,5.8168,4.2244,3.0603,0.0066,0.0493,2.9689,0.0013,1.307,2.1864,5.3519,1.9714,4.1606,4.4557,2.1557,4.143,1.8423,3.5088,3.095,4.0046,1.4103,0.8811,5.2481,4.1685,1.5976,6.7146,3.6597,4.4585,0.5205,2.6407,3.7299,1.4279,1.9753,5.0272,0.8027,3.5069,3.234,2.3495,1.4976,0.5866,0.2049,4.6085,0.8557,2.0291,3.4998,2.1361,0.9859,0.8016,0.2825,2.996,4.6271,3.9389,5.2726,2.6165,0.8702,5.031,1.2078,0.3354,1.3184,0.164,4.3698,0.2976,0.65,5.1087,3.4537,5.2255,4.1923,1.1533,2.8311,7.8204,1.6259,0.5166,0.8719,0.0681,5.6733,0.1377,2.1052,8.1218,1.0712,0.1951,3.4438,2.7622,3.1074,0.6945,6.4926,0.5222,6.8195,1.7908,0.3733,2.4305,0.0068,4.4543,3.4791,1.3685,0.3937,0.8829,4.105,2.0807,4.925,2.4626,4.5382,5.7745,2.3669,7.026,1.098,2.9466,4.5659,3.276,4.4053,4.9622,0.3183,5.4458,2.4036,4.6066,1.2946,3.7165,3.011,1.054,0.4681,2.6656,0.8788,2.3882,0.21,2.5994,2.7861,1.559,4.8685,0.8047,5.1752,3.4212,2.1954,0.0026,0.021,4.4556,3.1595,0.124,3.4817,2.3001,8.3446,0.5033,3.1398,0.9452,2.6363,3.2513,0.44,5.5668,3.4494,1.1877,4.8411,0.068,0.8075,0.4831,0.2606,3.2733,3.2993,4.5186,0.3993,1.2819,2.3484,2.0825,0.3793,1.4492,0.5467,3.3248,4.075,7.6575,4.2634,4.099,4.5389,0.4845,2.5313,0.4291,1.6097,5.0984,0.9115,3.1128,0.3901,6.1808,2.5448,3.9692,5.7919,1.0009,2.5447,2.5118,0.9805,4.1366,2.0763,0.9411,3.0604,2.3554,5.5429,2.0444,2.8609,4.7473,1.1494,2.5938,3.1019,3.3628,0.1369,2.9969,3.1723,5.3766,5.9023,3.1164,0.4139,0.9709,0.3111,1.7854,1.4563,1.1171,1.5107,0.8952,2.2451,4.289,2.0799,0.6806,3.8007,5.3545,0.3847,0.7275,4.5026,5.9621,5.0245,1.0015,1.3549,0.0214,0.4492,0.1505,2.7744,2.5199,5.5003,7.6406,0.1498,0.0665,1.7457,5.446,7.9861,0.395,6.4644,0.2775,4.3757,0.5648,1.877,3.758,0.6693,0.5748,3.3892,1.5608,4.3666,1.1602,0.6177,3.7986,2.2457,2.5189,15.8445,5.1606,5.8648,4.3436,1.2603,5.8653,5.4695,2.3668,1.5325,5.4704,0.3594,0.7342,1.9937,0.9418,0.3354,5.3181,3.8978,0.1028,0.5359,5.2652,0.3261,3.3522,3.4526,2.5454,2.0935,1.5273,1.4864,4.2987,1.929,3.4059,4.2937,2.1965,1.3712,2.8407,2.1224,0.3394,2.2192,0.4528,2.5151,0.8984,4.559,0.6713,5.6629,3.1984,5.9504,1.9833,1.4633,2.7229,1.8216,9.1841,2.2633,1.324,3.2381,0.7741,2.3277,0.2005,3.5821,1.8966,1.4435,0.2677]}
{"prompt":"My mom gave me a piece of paper and an essay question in a dream last night , and I thought I would share it with you guys . What would it be like in a hurricane from a baby dragon 's point of view ?","text":"My mom gave me a piece of paper and an essay question in a dream last night, and I thought I would share it with you guys. What would it be like in a hurricane from a baby dragon's point of view? We have seen dragon movies and books about dragons, and we all know how powerful and beautiful they are.\nIn a big windstorm, the baby dragon goes into a cave and the wind starts hurting it, so the little dragon pulls the paper over it and starts rubbing it with its little red tongue and says that is really soothing. Then it turns to go back out,but it starts getting wet by the storm and it turns back in to crawl under the paper. At first it can hear the storm but it is ok because it just pulls the paper up so that it's up against the walls,and it closes its eyes, and it is not afraid and starts playing.\nA few seconds later it comes out of the cave and the wind is still getting worse,so it starts pulling it down to the bottom of the cave. As it pulls it up the earth and sand blows in and starts filling the cave up faster. The little dragon looks up in the ceiling and sees an old owl with its wings out and one leg in the air, and she says that she will help the little dragon get out of there,but before she can speak the owl falls on an ant hill and starts eating it. The little red dragon says,what happens if the ants get there so the wind will not blow them away from the cave. The bird gives a low chirp and the ants leave the ant hill.\nThe little dragon then grabs the paper and starts walking out of the cave the owl is holding the paper up against the cave. As soon as the rocky land is just below the baby dragon,the little dragon walks on the rocky ground out of the cave, and the wind stops.\nNow imagine your baby dragon standing on the ground out there on the ground in a storm where the wind rips the leaves off,the tree branches off and hurts things,and the ground is covered in broken branches and leaves and rocks.What would the wind do to you baby dragon?\nWhat would if feel like standing on the ground in a hurricane of broken branches and leaves and rocks?","token_len":466,"entropy":[8.7232,4.984,0.4995,1.0475,4.9493,0.0269,0.7795,1.5059,5.5109,5.4304,7.2602,3.8767,2.9398,8.3023,6.6118,0.9552,1.9514,0.7144,0.8564,3.0921,2.3932,2.1714,4.0133,0.586,0.4714,0.5602,3.7856,0.5162,4.9165,3.2866,2.2477,0.4876,0.1668,4.4402,1.7675,9.3864,6.6393,2.8948,7.1504,8.4611,3.2035,4.736,0.0222,0.0003,0.3265,4.7177,3.1412,4.5427,6.312,3.7693,1.9799,4.9078,2.5577,0.7161,1.126,1.0905,2.2658,3.2679,0.5946,2.1441,4.4855,3.5703,3.4294,1.8744,0.2771,0.3766,2.9699,9.9977,2.2653,4.9907,6.9347,0.8652,0.6373,2.5542,5.193,0.245,5.0317,1.7293,1.1431,5.0882,1.2193,3.2461,3.2448,4.3632,7.687,2.3911,1.757,2.2154,1.6874,4.7464,0.4562,6.1045,1.6846,6.4607,4.1902,2.8837,0.6467,2.775,4.9612,0.7598,3.3694,0.6698,5.7465,6.21,2.7948,2.6308,3.3963,4.6442,4.4998,4.2796,7.9444,0.5794,3.0824,1.6829,3.4031,2.4531,3.7272,2.0939,3.0714,2.8766,11.8742,1.8128,4.0748,3.7639,3.5747,5.7186,0.4019,7.2024,1.1866,1.9674,4.1137,1.8174,2.2365,2.9837,7.2144,3.4796,0.3317,4.0571,1.127,5.2598,1.6722,0.9767,4.9454,5.9709,1.0679,4.3805,2.1392,1.0987,2.4938,8.3999,2.2648,0.6956,3.6782,5.9992,0.9555,0.1174,3.4403,3.429,2.1955,0.5997,3.9821,6.1005,1.3868,0.3139,5.933,2.4351,3.5195,1.4244,6.9313,0.7704,0.2846,2.7082,1.6605,0.8057,3.2253,4.148,3.1546,3.6489,4.7504,5.1455,3.0137,1.5478,4.0528,2.8998,3.5071,0.1739,1.6393,2.6839,1.0758,1.2425,0.4356,1.0875,0.6186,2.6024,2.5156,1.8013,3.4582,3.8851,4.1467,1.2466,3.5648,1.204,1.835,4.183,2.4694,3.0216,2.7838,1.0599,3.0881,0.8582,0.146,1.6562,1.1965,4.9965,0.7174,3.7218,1.2606,2.0577,2.6872,7.6619,3.9569,6.4446,5.3847,3.2865,1.4068,5.0188,6.5001,0.7242,1.2776,4.4511,8.5269,1.8431,2.0899,2.5757,0.1507,4.0977,1.3485,4.2948,1.3764,8.2421,0.5443,2.1214,4.982,2.6284,7.5111,3.2645,2.342,1.8368,3.1367,1.5839,5.9971,4.0605,3.3965,1.0183,0.426,1.5374,1.182,3.7156,1.6252,1.227,3.0233,3.0044,3.237,2.2206,1.0276,0.0457,2.6015,1.6799,0.6104,1.9465,2.1329,2.6332,4.6312,0.374,0.4807,7.362,3.12,4.3329,4.5107,3.3541,7.0115,4.9176,3.1023,0.8315,3.1855,5.3834,1.4188,0.731,1.6273,0.511,8.3486,0.4278,2.5548,3.4573,4.2856,5.6606,1.5722,1.5447,3.8262,2.7286,4.1499,5.8448,2.9452,6.2986,4.9406,3.871,0.8543,3.3782,1.291,2.3054,0.6264,1.4694,3.5208,1.8082,4.0122,5.5339,2.2271,6.4075,5.509,0.2694,0.7065,0.6267,1.7354,3.1318,6.0196,1.2622,3.9791,0.0781,1.4823,1.0134,1.438,0.758,0.3779,3.6504,5.4257,0.6227,1.1914,0.5825,1.5983,5.8135,3.0009,1.0135,0.1052,0.3008,6.6912,5.5967,2.7907,4.1862,5.4584,0.6076,2.3262,2.1222,1.5661,5.1532,3.2312,3.8987,3.3238,0.0161,1.1493,11.6776,5.5424,1.4412,7.0894,3.8481,0.3375,6.1466,0.0278,1.267,2.2475,1.547,0.8392,3.5179,4.4838,1.5938,3.6566,1.3237,5.2687,0.7041,0.1028,0.2583,1.6016,2.3279,1.2876,4.7261,4.2582,2.1823,1.7681,4.0425,5.8387,4.5678,2.4036,0.1218,4.7592,1.2991,0.9544,1.6798,4.8883,2.5938,2.9084,0.3238,1.9916,2.978,1.6379,3.6804,4.8737,1.2295,0.7158,7.3487,0.4217,1.9369,3.9028,0.4244,4.9905,3.7178,3.5638,0.4062,5.1913,2.2951,10.1256,6.1985,1.4323,1.2917,1.2019,4.169,1.5105,2.5715,0.9469,6.0731,2.7419,1.5454,2.7105,2.4327,5.1654,0.9028,7.7486,1.2454,2.8326,4.1828,0.502,0.3107,2.3813,3.1461,0.0782,0.693,1.3284,3.2503,0.393,7.6936,13.2944,1.2534,7.2433,0.7207,0.5852,0.5871,1.646,0.4575,1.7266,4.2985,3.8633,0.6984,0.2408,0.2277,0.7301,0.9284,1.2741]}
{"prompt":"In front of your desk","text":"In front of your desk, put one card of each color. At the top of the stack, choose the black card and place it atop the stack. Pick up the second card from the bottom of the stack (the one with the black star) and discard it. Repeat that process until the card at the top of the stack says \"six\" -- in other words, until you pick up all six black cards. Then, take the bottom card (the one with the black star), discard it, and pick up the top card (the one with the white star) and place it on the top of the stack. You now have the largest \"stack\" of black cards.\nFind the greatest difference between the numbers on a pair of cards from the set. This process resembles the process used to find the most common digit in a set -- but here, instead of choosing which card has the most often-chosen digit, you're choosing which card has the largest difference in numbers. You start by placing your cards face down, and then you pick a second card.\nWith the first card on top of the stack, remove the four outer corners from the card. Repeat that process up until there's only the smallest rectangle left. Carefully cut away all four edges, and hold the card on top of the stack. Now compare the numbers on the two cards. If the numbers differ by more than 2, you find the difference of that card pair and put it onto the set of differences. This process continues, until the set of differences has been completely filled. When you're finished, add the difference of the top card of the set of differences to the bottom two cards of the set. The bottom card of the set (the one on the left) has the greatest difference, and you know that this is the one with the largest difference in numbers.\nTo find the most common denominator, you first gather all the numbers that appear in a set of four. You can think about this process as gathering all the \"divisors,\" or the smallest numbers that divide other numbers. As you gather all the numbers that appear within a set, put the cards face down and then turn them over once or twice, until you have all the numbers, in ascending order, at the top of your hand.","token_len":466,"entropy":[7.9575,0.0131,5.762,5.7765,1.3218,5.8277,4.6468,4.551,3.3882,3.7093,1.5554,2.8727,5.8435,0.3867,1.3899,0.5933,0.4769,3.0906,0.4573,3.4086,2.0171,6.0595,1.0507,2.3705,1.9131,0.8724,6.8581,0.6846,3.1385,0.5736,5.5055,2.1632,0.6868,3.8336,0.3052,2.2714,0.3604,3.3514,0.4077,0.0747,0.16,4.8405,1.4717,1.7568,1.4287,0.3759,2.0904,7.3947,1.9602,0.1072,5.4131,0.363,0.4093,4.014,5.7865,0.7382,0.7579,2.1695,2.7677,6.9484,0.1282,0.3389,0.1762,0.0582,0.0869,6.3084,0.5559,10.0974,1.9611,5.8767,4.4542,1.5452,0.0021,0.1294,6.6838,0.9,5.2476,0.6155,3.2535,0.6487,4.4569,0.1241,0.8429,3.3494,1.0891,4.0303,0.8156,5.5311,0.9054,3.2805,0.5394,0.2796,0.1035,0.155,0.3977,0.1919,3.4846,2.9216,0.1301,0.3858,0.5412,3.6112,0.1301,0.3801,3.1234,0.3898,1.2143,0.0412,0.0357,0.0358,0.1151,1.4097,0.2663,1.3817,1.3635,1.5877,0.0934,1.4496,0.6339,2.1811,0.4008,0.1508,0.1229,0.3166,3.0172,3.731,0.1167,3.1103,6.6575,5.5173,6.1305,0.6241,0.6763,2.6311,0.1651,2.7417,1.3939,14.8534,0.9157,7.5442,7.363,0.401,1.1543,5.8088,2.8519,3.4844,6.2658,0.0308,1.1296,4.1612,0.7674,5.0018,0.9225,3.172,5.3118,7.4692,1.5713,1.428,3.2075,0.9695,0.8486,0.5284,2.7883,1.8841,7.5152,0.9677,0.6416,3.8673,4.3503,4.0931,4.9902,1.1799,3.4157,0.0926,3.5924,3.8029,2.144,4.3044,0.1206,1.0361,6.5049,1.5752,5.8814,0.0183,0.6557,0.2484,0.8445,3.3346,1.0829,0.9598,1.0099,0.4213,0.2037,4.8969,1.7642,2.4885,5.2689,0.5675,3.2853,5.7638,1.1408,4.7875,3.4485,2.1075,3.5769,0.54,2.0534,1.3815,1.3174,2.4109,3.0205,2.9266,5.3552,0.6173,2.1655,2.786,5.0944,1.4004,1.9255,0.4073,2.7227,1.8819,0.6288,0.219,0.234,0.1502,5.5665,0.9925,6.0473,7.1249,4.2774,2.0718,0.3907,2.8273,1.2991,4.8906,2.6942,0.2221,6.697,0.5998,4.0273,1.5133,1.8313,5.3492,2.938,8.0887,4.5572,1.1207,8.4117,0.0417,4.8291,4.7858,2.0605,3.1977,2.2663,1.8564,1.0681,6.3816,1.0265,1.4135,2.6712,1.0993,0.2598,0.415,0.6447,1.0536,2.9622,7.304,0.6325,3.3081,1.1371,0.6624,1.7096,0.7786,1.5548,2.5168,1.4309,1.9606,3.322,1.7283,1.7275,0.0105,3.9386,0.7124,1.1616,5.4697,1.4816,2.9837,3.9171,5.8851,0.6156,10.8604,4.441,7.6487,0.5191,3.4535,0.1239,5.7794,4.0668,11.7031,0.7922,3.5835,1.2887,5.1332,4.4654,0.589,1.8123,2.9938,1.5538,0.4809,2.2648,1.7189,3.9681,2.4335,1.0263,4.2164,0.6449,1.6923,2.3861,0.2945,4.4471,0.6835,5.888,0.9715,0.6783,4.2717,0.9871,2.7199,0.6367,0.4192,5.278,1.0613,0.5082,0.392,4.2431,5.2216,0.5318,0.7474,0.4117,0.2304,0.7126,3.1453,4.876,1.1168,0.9086,0.1364,0.048,4.2288,0.2693,0.1182,5.2844,0.5334,0.9393,0.5818,1.8472,0.7125,2.9599,0.1943,1.9302,1.3635,3.8016,4.7579,1.5498,3.6526,1.3177,0.5112,3.3973,1.7985,0.0505,1.6324,0.0812,0.8409,0.3293,0.2221,0.9453,3.9992,1.9749,0.345,2.1119,0.2139,6.9949,0.0146,1.6681,2.0359,3.7585,7.2947,1.3329,0.6739,0.9879,2.8565,3.3157,0.8574,1.6764,0.3834,1.9015,3.346,2.0745,2.6978,2.5352,5.1955,4.0263,1.4307,2.6807,0.9581,6.1486,1.4415,0.8763,4.1281,6.6064,1.971,0.2984,3.0001,1.7203,2.2426,3.6851,3.0277,1.2285,7.1356,9.169,1.0286,1.1827,4.3695,0.481,2.7083,2.0842,0.7601,0.5505,1.9362,0.4279,6.1474,0.497,0.0548,0.5798,4.6633,1.7038,3.1601,3.1542,0.6598,1.8735,2.6689,4.9386,1.1365,1.6659,4.763,3.5726,0.0038,2.8069,2.3844,0.5724,1.7579,2.0314,1.0472,1.3419,4.6323,3.7876,5.9221,0.0109,0.2806,4.438,0.6749,1.2375,0.5131,3.0575,4.9757,0.1397]}
{"prompt":"In your pub 's local bathroom , you see arrows creating a path leading outside . There is a paper that reads `` follow the arrows '' .","text":"In your pub's local bathroom, you see arrows creating a path leading outside. There is a paper that reads `` follow the arrows ''. It takes you first to an exit, then the bathroom. The arrow seems to go in a different direction. If you follow the arrow you will get to the bathroom, but the door is on the other side and you will not get out to visit the exit. So the exit must be there, but you can't see it. Is there a way I can learn what is on the other side of that door, and see it? I don't mind getting up to the exit ( I have a large bag of food and water ).\nThis will come down to a matter of trying to solve the puzzle step-by-step by changing the way the arrows are drawn to see which is the correct path. I think this works if the exit is at the back, where the arrows aren't leading you, but it may work differently.\nThere are several rules to determine where to escape from a paper, but the easiest is probably to look for places where there's not enough room to go without touching the edges. That probably explains why so many attempts to escape ended dead right at the wrong place.\nIt's probably going to take a lot of trial-and-error to find the right place. On the other hand, it's a little better than getting stuck in a cave.\nI like this, with a few little changes. One is to add your own arrows to the wall. Make sure they are in the right order ; the door to the exit is going to be in the middle and you need to find out which way out you need to use ( left or right ). Also make sure the arrows don't go into a corner, so they can be easily crossed to see the other side of the room.\nIn addition, the puzzle isn't 100% complete and you get stuck sometimes. There is a place where you can't escape for a second time ( probably to make it less likely to be caught if you're running away without a clear map ). It's an exit to a huge area that contains a trap. You can't escape, but you can get through the trap. That will require a little more work and some reading of the rules.","token_len":466,"entropy":[6.1473,10.3423,4.5642,6.3423,8.479,0.6024,2.1039,5.4089,9.8117,10.4072,1.1275,4.0708,4.0769,6.2502,1.2062,4.0219,1.6794,0.9293,8.3101,6.3733,3.6061,8.6876,13.1878,0.7002,2.4872,6.2144,4.7229,3.8699,4.0195,1.5022,8.1791,0.7926,4.2896,4.5883,1.8299,1.4544,2.7225,5.0832,1.28,2.5089,3.2916,6.8905,0.1298,2.7854,2.6071,2.9231,2.4688,0.0133,1.2599,3.0314,0.3777,2.2457,0.593,0.9903,2.9537,1.0284,2.1986,1.6548,0.6717,1.5453,1.8121,1.0709,2.7313,4.0359,1.4928,4.6298,0.5432,2.0289,0.041,3.1959,1.0336,1.6804,2.248,1.216,2.8227,4.5009,6.3872,0.8811,5.065,0.3503,3.6229,2.6994,4.6964,4.227,0.2996,4.5723,1.93,1.6438,1.7128,1.9566,0.6945,2.5774,0.7948,0.9147,6.6149,0.6457,0.7162,1.1796,4.9824,0.2967,6.553,3.9193,2.2776,4.4165,0.3079,0.5062,0.0396,1.1311,3.3391,1.2949,2.8067,1.7356,4.312,2.079,1.4132,2.287,2.2749,0.0014,6.3757,5.0074,3.9443,2.4661,1.8891,3.9995,5.1959,7.4093,2.9955,1.9347,5.5028,4.6525,0.9056,3.6153,1.9485,2.0054,2.8293,3.417,5.4182,4.6362,5.5493,4.7885,0.1495,2.6978,3.91,0.0051,5.6644,0.262,5.341,0.87,1.6819,9.2461,2.0631,0.0122,0.0008,0.0004,5.0993,5.6387,0.672,3.3011,1.6215,1.9041,1.0543,2.5801,3.8034,3.6148,2.7823,3.4167,1.7286,2.3409,2.0767,0.6195,2.807,3.116,1.8339,4.5626,4.8714,2.5666,6.3762,0.5821,3.9928,0.6628,4.8079,2.5776,3.1302,1.2774,1.9434,4.6539,0.0014,7.5705,4.1118,2.8242,1.085,3.7345,3.1467,3.0419,4.9251,3.3638,1.5773,3.7068,0.6758,2.8787,6.1312,1.7118,6.1272,2.3172,1.8761,8.2003,1.7559,1.6825,6.3789,3.2281,2.27,1.8071,2.653,1.6674,5.1305,0.7276,3.6524,1.6004,5.479,0.7692,2.3723,2.9698,3.6104,2.2114,1.637,1.4667,1.6803,5.2433,4.4485,0.7981,5.4105,0.9943,4.3239,6.9928,5.3165,0.8609,5.1574,0.0719,7.9961,1.5751,1.5913,7.2398,7.9379,5.562,3.9475,0.4056,5.924,1.2758,0.4,1.1435,4.0075,0.9782,3.5543,4.8616,0.0163,1.0537,1.1696,1.4876,0.402,3.6152,3.9777,0.0117,0.0003,0.001,0.8278,1.9103,1.3316,1.2812,1.5399,1.6511,5.7237,0.6976,0.4989,0.0164,0.0899,2.4584,1.0359,3.2402,3.6189,3.2125,3.3424,4.3707,2.1939,0.8707,0.8148,5.0411,1.661,1.4942,2.5114,3.9454,3.1403,4.7297,6.465,1.9716,2.1702,4.8969,3.5828,1.0262,3.6494,1.1764,1.6122,4.3517,6.7536,1.559,2.8147,1.3401,0.6354,4.9919,1.5633,6.3521,0.7092,2.9584,1.2006,2.7039,0.6097,1.0816,3.4899,9.2434,2.6541,5.3193,2.8086,0.1717,4.8588,1.4667,4.0917,0.333,0.7234,2.3883,0.3499,2.4557,3.3792,1.7632,2.9468,0.2292,3.2741,5.0615,1.4965,1.6197,5.669,2.361,2.436,0.1733,6.634,5.6781,8.047,1.8258,0.0482,0.7266,3.7505,2.3314,0.0564,1.7631,2.4996,2.9911,0.0008,1.7059,2.9389,2.1583,3.8443,1.9918,2.3733,2.2446,2.1988,2.1035,3.4045,5.3341,3.6615,3.6262,1.9339,2.5092,0.7639,1.5771,0.1276,2.4998,0.3165,0.8661,4.1256,3.0082,0.5103,3.0931,5.9706,5.0106,0.0006,7.5182,0.0689,2.3491,4.3587,1.7708,6.3432,2.2614,5.7917,0.8882,3.3324,2.2374,1.0124,4.9231,1.2895,0.5868,0.5986,4.1345,3.1364,5.2513,1.286,3.7377,4.3453,2.8613,5.5949,3.9561,3.5381,1.9586,3.9962,3.2609,2.1764,2.1034,3.4693,4.6999,0.2272,2.807,5.3513,2.5327,7.4033,2.1686,5.1737,5.2597,1.343,3.2442,0.8195,4.8632,6.6047,3.4851,1.7978,6.3518,3.3403,2.5635,4.4327,1.5416,6.469,2.3464,2.9288,1.3459,1.837,1.9124,3.0163,1.1107,0.6461,0.3151,2.4729,3.1877,2.5678,1.0216,1.7063,4.5655,3.7692,4.7501,1.5404,2.3227,2.3998,3.5979,2.6073,2.6599,7.0686,2.2081,0.4969,2.5121,0.6241]}

In a sense, it is the island's pride and it can also be called Iceland's most popular tourist attraction.\nThe first known recorded mention of Christianity in Iceland was in the 9th-century book of Icelandic Historia Regum, a compilation of many of the previous centuries written by Icelandic historian Her\u00f0ulf Haraldsson.\nOn 10 August, Reykjavik passed the one million mark in its population. From the s onwards, Reykjavik grew rapidly, and even surpassed the German city of Frankfurt am Main which was still the European centre of the financial economy in the s. In, the capital relocated to its present location, from a small village near Kirkjufell ; it now consists of 13 municipalities and contains approximately % of the Icelandic population.\nThe current municipal boundaries were determined by the Local Government Act of In, Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson signed the Law for the Establishment of a New Icelandic Capital, a law which would locate the capital far enough from the Icelandic Arctic Region and the remote far North to improve the conditions for Iceland's international trade.\nThe new government building, which was to serve as the centre of government from that point onwards, was opened to the public in, soon after the Icelandic Parliament voted to relocate to its current location.\nThe first permanent settlement in Iceland was established by a band of Norse colonizers who had recently returned to Scandinavia as part of Ragnar Lodbrok's expedition after the Battle of Heimdallr.\nThe majority of the Icelandic population today are descendants of the colonizers and their heirs, and a handful of them descend from native settlers.","token_len":467,"entropy":[7.8746,13.0643,3.2234,3.1728,8.4839,1.568,5.9366,0.8715,5.7549,4.7072,3.9587,1.2176,2.0626,6.5176,2.1383,5.6541,3.559,7.6715,1.0123,9.2054,6.8981,4.4101,3.5453,4.6988,6.3614,5.013,4.3176,2.6305,5.8211,3.1994,1.2833,3.6007,1.7627,2.0794,2.8778,0.9375,0.9717,0.6784,5.4928,2.6125,3.505,2.1283,2.8977,2.7489,0.4198,0.2043,0.0231,0.1913,1.3729,8.6741,4.8309,2.4085,5.9493,3.4616,6.1205,0.1409,4.0099,3.3139,6.3954,1.9091,6.0557,3.9871,3.6124,4.4416,2.3722,3.428,6.178,2.0588,1.7682,8.3489,2.8378,4.8231,5.3592,0.3393,7.1401,0.0984,6.4364,4.0599,0.1942,0.0,1.6533,4.5311,1.0349,5.4208,7.6639,2.2542,6.2905,4.873,4.7856,4.3367,0.5557,5.9576,2.1902,7.7721,1.6151,2.9801,4.7126,2.4887,1.2162,14.7907,7.4472,4.3254,3.4783,1.2638,7.5219,1.5086,1.3246,4.5814,6.2572,0.0096,0.0221,0.6532,0.9591,0.8677,2.0325,3.6643,1.6973,3.4772,0.5698,6.3071,7.416,3.5351,0.7947,2.6267,2.3089,9.2405,2.9791,1.0937,1.5219,3.683,4.5499,0.8851,4.0616,4.1658,3.6343,0.6242,1.0957,0.9298,1.3461,8.2986,0.431,8.0068,1.7556,3.8837,5.0874,3.9484,0.2151,2.1914,2.4321,0.4465,2.0319,3.705,2.7001,0.4844,0.2466,1.0946,2.8434,3.6647,5.3415,5.595,3.5103,0.0762,5.7627,0.9357,0.3446,1.5115,0.7266,1.1897,4.5925,0.1102,4.9378,1.2721,4.5296,0.9533,3.8639,4.8233,2.7843,7.2866,3.9285,2.6844,3.6751,3.6835,0.2618,5.2232,2.7468,0.2927,6.7809,3.6904,3.2031,0.6277,3.1643,2.5355,6.6459,4.092,6.9961,5.6361,0.9873,0.9483,0.6217,2.4622,5.4309,5.1906,2.9213,2.4842,6.7705,0.0009,0.0067,0.2958,5.612,1.6744,6.4655,3.1626,0.9666,2.8564,3.0851,4.99,1.0664,5.0572,1.8112,8.624,14.8922,0.509,4.3554,0.0038,0.0037,0.0322,3.7383,4.4719,1.6881,2.0865,4.4858,5.0236,1.2665,5.8975,1.8239,0.4626,4.5392,9.9503,0.0009,6.1339,1.5064,3.8824,2.7354,5.7396,5.0277,0.4575,1.0746,7.8088,4.5156,2.0387,0.633,6.8556,6.9239,4.3622,8.5486,1.5364,3.794,12.0134,0.9855,3.2317,1.6381,0.8289,1.7,5.5094,3.7466,3.3269,2.9138,3.366,8.608,5.1082,8.3672,5.0327,9.7249,3.1379,2.9374,4.4536,0.208,5.3245,5.9368,2.044,5.9066,4.488,13.3917,1.3425,0.532,5.0948,0.6159,0.3184,1.0435,1.6033,5.2016,7.0213,3.3357,3.6794,3.9729,0.3949,0.9215,6.8261,0.7259,2.7118,0.9961,10.1863,6.7975,8.0172,7.9627,0.1503,4.491,0.663,0.0005,0.0014,3.0071,0.002,0.0183,0.0099,0.0108,4.0942,4.3184,4.6859,3.6337,1.0069,5.4626,0.0511,0.9683,4.1041,3.7056,4.471,1.9863,4.5955,1.8606,1.2882,3.8937,10.612,0.7048,1.077,8.3196,3.0571,2.0019,0.839,5.3599,7.9823,6.2044,2.3681,2.8818,7.1169,6.1352,4.0553,2.616,7.3371,0.9689,3.9555,1.2012,4.9402,0.6381,6.0157,1.5543,0.9046,0.9906,1.3303,2.5953,4.0076,5.7441,2.411,1.9736,1.9024,3.3002,4.8759,0.2256,0.6289,4.4979,0.3789,4.5782,4.8797,5.9691,1.0908,3.008,0.1486,1.155,4.9514,2.5137,0.7262,0.0561,1.1998,6.325,7.7894,0.6204,0.965,5.6743,1.9088,3.3465,0.9321,6.2467,1.5403,2.4879,1.6035,0.3468,1.0158,0.9638,1.2666,2.813,5.2616,4.1758,1.9538,0.3667,0.8375,2.885,1.9749,3.464,5.739,0.1744,4.338,6.167,1.0907,2.606,2.9395,4.9702,3.3468,1.0409,4.6125,0.0064,4.596,2.0006,0.0007,6.8428,3.9022,4.2345,0.4144,1.5111,3.5376,5.989,1.573,4.0164,0.0159,6.3796,4.8665,1.3115,0.0035,6.0513,1.1169,1.738,1.2049,7.2313,0.0554,0.8104,4.8098,0.895,4.8896,2.4689,3.4036,0.0267,0.9822,6.2846,0.4519,2.349,2.4549,5.6116,1.4704,2.1279,3.7306,5.7884,0.3539,3.3731,7.8613,0.2268,6.5344,5.2845,1.1605]}

You win. You want to be a true politician. But the people are not going to accept this. They have no problem accepting that you are the ultimate joke\nIn this video I talk about the things that have made me stop following politics in the past. I go into detail about my views on corruption, the press and more. Do you think I have the same beliefs as you?\nSo you think you should listen to what the opposition party is saying but only when it suits your opinion. Are you surprised by this?\nThe worst day in my life was when a person decided to put their opinion ahead of a child who was about to die. When this happened it made me realize that I was a nobody and that everyone had the right to hate me and put me down and to have my opinions disregarded\nToday was my first day in politics. I thought I would do my best but I can't even tell you how embarrassing it was to hold the ballot paper I received. I didn't have the right to vote. You decide you get the chance to participate as a member of the opposition\nYes and it takes a great deal more than that. You need to have confidence in yourself. If you don't have confidence in yourself then you put your own agenda above that of the people who are in the streets and the people who have to take your decisions\nYou decide to write a book that will criticize the government. If you do the same thing the next time you will have no confidence in yourself.\nYes I will do that if I have to. When the President signs a wrong bill it's his responsibility and I am going to say that he should stop that\nWhen I saw how the military had taken control over the country I know that things can't go on that way\nWe need to think of the future. That is why we should not get caught up in the past. The past is important but it will not get us into the future.\nI have always found it useful.

The aliens take a terrible toll of their victims and soon the survivors have little choice but to ask what is wrong with them?\nIn 2016, we can say with full confidence that social networks and technology is at its peak! Today, the market competition is fierce, and companies are trying to create a unique and attractive offer for their target groups. One of these solutions is the creation of a beautifully designed Facebook ad. This will help you in directing traffic and boost your sales.\nFacebook Ads are usually created in the form of banners or post ads, they are presented alongside the news feed, and in some cases, next to the posts made by the user who opens it. Thanks to Facebook\u2019s ads, you can achieve a high conversion rate. It is quite difficult for your customers to ignore this message, because it\u2019s easy to recognize the brand and use it. However, Facebook Ads have many other advantages, and most of them will become clear when you choose it in your business online strategy.\nThe main advantage of Facebook ads, you can say, is that it is more easily accepted by your target audience. In Facebook, we see many different posts, and advertising can be presented alongside them as a banner. It\u2019s the same design, the same font style, but to them it looks very different from other ads.\nOne advantage cannot have its negative effects, then the result would be one-sided \u2013 a banner in the form of an ad is more attractive for the users, but they will not click on it. And then it will be ineffective.

Today you receive a sending from a person you have never seen before. You receive a message from that person explaining you why they did not live on this Earth and the reason why they have left, but leave the door open to you to go back in. They send you the message to go back in and help them. Go back in and try and heal them in any way you can. When you do so, they send you a message to come to them and see that everything is OK.\nSo they send you a message to go back in and work on healing them. That is exactly what you do. Today we see them, there is nothing to hide from them and they know who they are. The question to you is ; are you ready to return the favour and send a message to your Heavenly Parent explaining your situation? If not, stay in your comfort zone and do not interfere in other\u2019s lives too much, be patient, and let the karma play out. They are working on you and not you the working on them.\nOnce you understand this, you will change your life.

You have come to the place where you have always wanted to be, you can go home, everything is now so beautiful and serene and so peaceful.\nYour spirit brother and sister are guiding you, guiding you in the way that you know best. They want you to come and see and experience the many new gifts that you have. Gifts that all of us are now receiving because our path was being closed.\nYou are now entering a new way of doing things, where there is no need to fight any of your problems. The problems are going to fade away and you are ready and able to open your heart even wider to accept the gift that you have.","token_len":468,"entropy":[3.591,3.2792,4.3443,0.8734,3.8275,6.2862,7.0621,8.9501,0.4014,11.2262,4.3706,1.9096,1.2628,2.0613,1.749,5.3216,3.2925,3.9863,0.1143,0.8098,7.9855,5.102,6.8796,1.2124,7.799,1.4786,1.4663,1.7563,1.4906,3.9494,2.6138,3.2014,0.5806,0.6794,2.7335,2.7667,0.8055,1.6113,0.6739,3.3134,0.1191,6.3784,3.6355,7.6795,1.3765,3.6024,3.5244,5.3771,5.4443,3.1567,2.9411,1.9861,3.5823,1.9538,1.2021,0.8452,2.8898,3.4789,3.8621,3.5236,6.7912,2.6351,7.0389,0.3043,1.3425,2.4389,2.8117,3.9338,1.2454,1.5863,2.6103,4.6427,3.2743,0.9576,3.3586,0.57,3.0876,2.9784,0.4774,0.837,1.6575,4.3843,2.9348,1.9892,7.629,0.3656,0.5162,1.0705,3.9893,3.1572,5.0226,1.9652,4.521,3.6752,0.0461,0.5456,0.2198,0.4611,4.644,0.6853,2.871,3.0737,0.2136,1.8977,2.8592,0.4868,1.4767,0.4443,2.0989,3.0779,3.0496,2.3263,0.8727,4.4165,2.9634,5.9727,0.7477,2.3488,0.5709,2.0669,7.5845,5.1373,1.1303,0.268,1.2475,0.2216,1.3237,1.5692,0.2311,0.2815,0.5046,6.9785,1.5448,1.6616,1.4273,0.9782,3.8491,1.5435,5.0341,0.2118,1.8273,1.6559,0.6326,7.5307,4.0225,3.3921,4.6749,5.3613,5.3502,0.7024,2.0208,2.4285,4.4448,2.806,0.7272,2.4289,1.1611,3.6372,4.4318,0.9684,0.0765,0.3925,3.3007,6.6303,3.4403,3.2474,0.4085,12.1398,3.5865,0.474,1.9865,0.4747,4.734,4.0637,4.1025,1.5373,3.9638,1.9711,0.3116,0.4911,3.3287,6.4694,7.4701,7.7725,3.43,2.7591,1.3695,3.0424,1.9893,0.3317,6.3922,2.2528,1.4877,3.5668,0.1361,0.8574,2.6296,1.282,6.0563,1.9914,4.3816,15.7566,7.4237,2.7303,2.965,7.5193,1.1656,3.3174,5.236,2.7883,1.7369,1.4309,4.0093,1.9041,7.7479,6.2731,0.9544,1.0513,5.114,1.9234,6.5748,1.0517,2.4739,1.3131,4.9122,2.1037,7.1573,9.9234,0.9835,0.5987,0.3794,1.2667,5.5439,0.564,3.9651,1.9442,1.1387,0.9874,0.8889,7.4401,0.7064,2.2569,1.1893,4.45,0.7262,0.6563,5.6617,2.2294,0.4123,8.1878,3.0538,2.9274,3.5317,0.8267,2.7641,0.2077,0.2871,2.5075,4.5992,0.3044,3.1397,6.593,0.4712,2.1963,3.1555,2.3515,4.9171,4.8897,0.8532,2.7505,1.111,5.1343,2.346,10.7276,3.6135,2.2476,3.8504,2.337,1.3541,3.6502,0.7935,7.0449,1.6137,0.8172,0.0725,3.5109,4.2373,4.8688,1.9223,0.6291,3.6449,5.787,0.9708,3.2045,0.705,2.2997,0.608,3.0075,1.4358,0.1443,3.4518,2.1767,1.0539,1.6016,2.4053,3.2852,5.1452,1.816,1.4966,6.7556,6.3613,8.4863,0.2887,3.4832,1.8554,4.4065,3.6543,0.9727,1.447,0.8693,4.4003,2.2529,2.0823,1.7805,5.1089,2.4655,1.1988,1.482,2.5519,5.7834,1.428,3.8908,0.2871,1.6727,1.3614,2.9358,0.9065,1.0712,4.2179,0.8914,0.9431,2.1183,3.0129,2.0066,0.2496,1.8531,1.7388,3.0145,3.9803,3.3123,3.8199,2.2333,7.3297,0.715,3.5659,3.9561,2.8493,1.0048,7.5227,0.1062,1.7661,3.5312,1.7936,0.6271,2.2261,3.2447,4.0408,6.8002,2.3257,1.383,1.6953,7.7116,0.0543,2.8317,4.762,0.1489,3.0104,1.2997,3.1199,2.1021,0.4515,4.4608,3.0635,0.6081,2.3029,4.4107,0.7672,0.089,2.9279,3.2373,1.9546,3.8533,3.0339,1.4901,5.6828,4.9791,5.5576,0.8442,1.0648,0.5672,4.5162,11.1567,0.4463,5.0623,1.5765,0.7486,2.2817,4.0938,3.7191,4.4553,3.8288,8.2281,3.1074,7.2284,5.0148,1.5063,1.4997,1.8095,1.3207,1.7398,3.2156,0.6834,0.2666,5.0264,0.4206,5.0262,0.5963,1.7276,4.3628,3.6073,0.5154,0.8694,2.6297,0.6356,5.2141,4.3938,3.6359,1.8884,3.2209,1.1396,3.1929,5.1183,1.5338,4.1308,0.3111,6.572,0.5746,1.3318,0.8239,2.3677,3.0856,4.4842,1.5238,0.0297,5.042,1.5894,1.6162,6.9409,4.5857,2.8322,5.621,1.2925,3.1512,1.0953,0.8844,0.6684,2.7612]}

I asked him a lot about how he would do this, and he finally said, \"I will\"\nMy mum said to me that I was such a handsome little boy, she would see to it in school that people stopped laughing at me and started to look at me as if I were special and they even looked up to me.\nAt one point my friend (male and female) came up and complimented me so much on my height, my good looks and my personality. He went on to say that he liked me from the first day I met me, and that he would never stop wanting me. He told me that it was only because of my height that he couldn't have me.\nAt the same time my other friend had her eyes on me and he said that he was in love with me from the first day he met me.

{"prompt":"The first use for immortality is in law . People are forced to carry out their full sentence : you interview someone 300 years into their 'life ' sentence .","text":"The first use for immortality is in law. People are forced to carry out their full sentence : you interview someone 300 years into their 'life'sentence. It's almost unbelievable it was possible to get the time to get the interview. A year or two earlier it was reported that some inmates were still going to prison - that the sentence was still in force.\nImmunology : if you can turn off your immune system, that would be like having no brain. If you could kill all of your immune cells, a year later, they'd be replaced by healthy ones. That is, however, not easy to do. The system turns the immune response on and off depending on cell type. Your immune system recognizes cancer cells and kills them, but if it sees an organ, it kills the organ. If you can turn off this process, you could get cancer cells to multiply and then they would become cancer. Now, researchers at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute are using stem cells to reprogram immune cells to destroy cancer cells. They have done this successfully in mice.\nA further use is in medicine. If we could find people who have a genetic mutation, and give their cells the ability to produce a drug that would knock that mutation out, that might cure cancer. The researchers have done some successes in this area as well - it's difficult to say whether the cure results from the gene being changed, or from the fact that the person had an immune system that was not functioning at its best. The use of immortality in medicine is extremely attractive at this time because it would be easier for researchers to take hold of the cells than to work with a human being.\nA further use is to develop techniques which enable us to create organs of our own. Since the 1990s many countries have used this technique as a way of creating organs of their own. A number of people have taken the tissues from the donors, and modified them to work normally - that's how we got to transplants. The technique is already being used successfully in animals to make parts of the human body - eyes, kidneys - with success. In theory, if you had a kidney that worked and was good enough, then there would be absolutely no need to go through the painful process of getting a kidney from someone else and then turning it back over.","token_len":469,"entropy":[5.3423,7.0187,2.9087,11.1235,1.6408,1.9651,7.6726,1.1193,5.0901,2.5676,4.9068,0.1237,5.4275,0.9221,2.6126,6.7924,5.4734,12.1074,5.5288,13.765,3.8039,12.7467,0.9636,4.0895,0.6748,6.5619,1.1496,5.0123,15.0744,4.1152,4.9746,3.3285,1.0696,4.6851,5.2944,5.9416,3.5543,2.1728,1.0885,3.2364,3.5113,5.3123,1.8984,3.5535,2.5354,5.9827,1.5298,4.8938,4.9512,2.442,0.8583,5.0329,3.132,0.6446,7.7866,0.3846,3.9195,5.1963,1.44,4.3576,4.7239,1.1067,1.6221,5.684,3.4288,3.6226,3.9897,0.7855,3.9726,2.7329,2.0381,0.8065,2.5183,15.9826,6.9715,4.1435,5.8366,5.2485,0.6757,3.2444,6.6606,3.3218,2.0364,4.7011,0.0728,0.9263,4.1285,3.8512,0.8602,5.081,3.6264,4.3755,4.6775,1.1841,2.917,0.2297,2.8923,4.3727,3.6218,1.8628,1.1365,2.4164,1.4742,0.6386,5.5442,4.6019,1.5036,1.548,2.8718,1.6077,0.9265,5.7199,0.791,4.3449,0.8429,0.3979,3.5307,2.8099,2.0965,8.0438,0.9072,2.1627,5.108,2.6698,0.2842,0.576,2.6053,5.6966,6.8565,3.7603,1.6274,5.5471,1.6112,1.8922,0.1633,4.2939,0.0852,7.568,0.765,1.0257,5.6265,0.9398,0.3363,7.0364,5.5833,0.8291,1.3993,3.1115,0.0994,1.6828,0.8936,2.3886,2.3941,4.496,3.3082,4.3982,2.4215,0.5416,3.5217,1.7616,0.8556,0.8886,2.2306,1.101,1.969,2.3323,0.6631,4.1547,3.145,0.3751,1.4347,2.3676,3.2343,2.2766,1.9746,1.5436,3.011,1.4427,3.2964,4.2516,1.7172,3.7035,1.2959,2.4677,5.4779,1.1633,7.747,3.0339,1.0835,9.7585,1.1665,6.1753,2.0659,1.4749,2.9693,3.1425,5.0589,0.2128,1.4819,5.6033,0.0168,2.8336,0.1927,1.4227,5.7754,0.5091,0.1959,0.6758,2.0691,2.2087,4.4001,0.5285,3.4227,1.1287,1.5707,0.9883,1.5174,4.0427,6.2271,2.0046,1.5373,1.0759,2.1126,0.4252,3.1994,4.0185,2.3211,4.7928,5.3049,0.5552,3.0788,2.9495,3.3872,1.2398,2.2534,2.7575,4.757,6.2494,3.1732,2.4365,2.2061,0.0102,2.8116,2.3564,3.289,1.1214,2.5228,6.0825,5.3794,1.2681,0.375,0.4008,2.3077,3.513,4.4989,0.634,0.5816,2.691,3.9403,2.2248,2.522,4.885,8.7989,1.3508,1.4631,0.8108,5.2779,0.0987,3.0877,3.8478,1.2087,5.5135,0.2293,3.5134,2.2332,2.7873,4.4428,7.889,0.8853,2.1231,2.9821,5.5098,3.5654,1.2933,0.6352,1.8921,1.2835,3.5176,0.0873,1.2554,2.638,3.3231,2.9639,3.2971,1.4341,0.8005,1.8009,2.9939,3.0796,3.68,4.1695,2.5667,0.2977,2.7838,6.0059,0.1063,5.4291,2.6334,0.2921,0.8603,5.1794,4.3898,6.1756,1.3604,2.5471,2.4936,0.9728,2.4982,1.9062,3.7695,2.0005,3.8434,0.0997,4.5465,6.6021,0.1579,1.3937,3.1636,4.4267,1.156,5.0162,0.9365,3.7522,2.4542,2.464,0.6086,0.9235,3.2268,3.3421,0.785,0.6127,3.1784,2.4604,5.1747,4.5944,4.8683,2.3531,0.0253,4.0715,5.7633,3.0953,2.1117,0.0923,0.6036,6.0282,2.1759,6.2599,0.0882,5.382,3.8424,0.2572,3.9619,3.8051,1.7662,3.2094,0.707,1.1012,0.7503,2.993,1.0941,0.7978,0.5095,0.0085,0.5563,3.9642,4.0283,0.0508,2.6879,0.5122,4.7471,2.0916,10.4866,2.246,2.6516,6.1868,1.9859,1.2272,5.1447,0.1432,1.1151,3.7433,5.7618,3.0688,3.5205,1.779,2.3787,1.6328,2.7369,3.7408,7.3747,0.413,0.8655,2.3658,3.8434,1.1764,4.6144,1.1552,0.2762,4.7559,0.2212,4.3991,3.4852,2.4869,7.055,0.1195,1.7176,3.3361,0.2555,3.6181,8.1674,0.2471,2.7156,4.341,4.5886,6.521,0.2928,3.1577,5.4805,0.3702,3.3825,1.2384,4.2107,1.0647,2.5258,1.8009,3.7605,3.2517,2.8942,4.8912,1.6199,1.6692,2.5795,3.962,1.0572,0.1073,6.3645,0.082,1.1517,0.965,4.5465,1.3145,1.3162,5.6466,1.3131,0.1243,3.5605,1.6453,2.6322,2.502,1.8802,2.0539,4.3541,2.3294,5.0536,0.55,2.5573,2.6582,2.275]}

Do not copy the content from the story you already have, I want something new for it. So write your story from a new perspective and let me know, or better yet, make me an example of your original story!\nThis week, I started planning a story that I wrote at my first ever Zombie Apocalypse. I plan to make this story full of characters and events that you rarely see in most Apocalypse novels, for it to be more realistic than the usual ones. I plan this story to be in two parts, I hope you guys might even be more interested in it by the time, it starts!\nI want to thank all of my friends and followers on this site for being so supportive and encouraging. All of yours words of wisdom have truly helped me reach a lot of people not only through the site, but also outside of it. I would like to give a thank to the most active follower to this site, which is the \" Black Cat \". Thank you so very much my friend, I really appreciate it!\nAnd after so much waiting, you guys finally get to read my short story. It will be in two parts as well, so be ready for a full story!\nYou guys must know who they are, or at least you have heard of them! All of you people have been saying that I should do an article on them, but I did it very late, so I did not want to waste your time reading it right away.\nThis week, a lot has been going on in the world, and so this story about the zombie outbreak is more than just a blog post it is more like a record of what is going on in the world, right now. I did not want to just leave my thoughts just on my blog without putting it into a longer context.\nAt the start of my story, all of you must know that this is not a story written from \" my point of view \", it is meant to be from the view of several others, of which one of them is still unknown to many, although she may be one of the smartest of all. They can either save the world, or let it die in this first part of the story.","token_len":469,"entropy":[10.9359,4.6132,2.3586,5.2832,6.2398,3.3412,4.931,1.0108,3.5192,4.1113,4.6061,2.2048,2.122,11.7409,3.9392,1.196,4.4346,9.5933,2.5523,6.824,0.4849,6.5011,1.7303,1.2118,5.6521,2.4888,6.8689,2.6488,3.2898,2.1578,1.8085,4.0565,3.3006,4.3791,1.5681,1.8598,4.1557,3.7314,5.8799,1.9699,2.4369,4.7576,0.7494,4.8443,4.7009,3.2602,0.9189,3.7114,3.391,2.3753,1.8763,1.7993,4.1794,0.4702,0.1094,4.7637,3.9064,4.9267,0.124,0.442,3.8075,2.9102,3.0031,3.6968,1.257,1.8849,4.5213,1.3331,3.0058,1.1718,7.0409,4.4817,1.5783,0.9799,5.2454,6.3557,1.9028,2.6843,2.6289,1.7349,4.9864,4.5453,2.7605,4.2647,3.9433,4.4157,2.0332,2.9191,1.3578,5.2702,0.9217,3.0311,2.8235,1.728,6.1704,0.3925,4.4987,1.5667,2.8657,1.1948,2.5527,7.6589,0.2446,0.768,5.3861,7.5096,3.6964,1.3918,5.8006,5.3031,2.8364,0.8508,3.5873,3.0955,2.0529,1.4078,3.9816,5.5618,0.6289,1.6009,3.0921,5.4744,0.3757,0.4986,0.6431,4.6343,4.4771,0.9243,0.9428,4.9893,2.3609,1.2714,3.084,7.4385,6.8091,3.0094,5.6892,1.5597,0.352,2.0976,6.2841,1.8652,1.8301,7.7628,4.614,6.9868,4.3053,0.7033,1.8449,3.536,0.5081,2.2685,1.5957,0.7539,2.3517,1.9614,1.3862,3.9384,3.1271,3.5187,2.0454,0.7194,3.2585,1.3653,1.5901,1.3525,2.8248,1.7766,4.9303,0.6382,8.0704,11.3722,2.0594,3.1752,2.6077,5.6258,2.2166,0.561,4.5793,4.1894,3.5091,0.074,0.7336,7.753,0.3628,2.343,1.5875,3.9275,0.6895,0.0681,0.9696,6.1344,0.417,0.6488,0.5366,1.6229,3.1179,0.6157,0.0416,4.0223,0.8819,5.451,5.2637,2.4871,5.8542,4.6491,6.8648,5.129,2.1308,0.3287,0.9315,5.1158,1.1804,2.546,4.5401,11.4641,5.4354,4.3037,3.1453,0.0167,2.3112,4.1147,0.0129,7.4833,2.313,1.5318,2.8272,2.8066,0.8204,1.3284,1.545,0.6511,4.1444,5.7876,4.7752,1.5187,4.402,0.6914,3.7821,1.5849,4.4036,3.3934,1.0486,1.7822,1.762,6.3756,0.2736,2.772,2.2762,2.9632,0.4894,3.7606,3.6371,0.1901,5.4708,0.2643,1.0674,2.1469,3.4756,3.9013,1.2366,3.3484,3.3541,2.2762,2.6892,0.738,3.8249,2.6672,5.5703,2.885,4.2486,5.771,0.1788,1.3442,3.6988,2.1821,0.0272,2.9864,3.6567,2.8633,0.7356,0.1752,2.6836,5.3049,1.1014,0.9814,4.6636,2.731,1.3894,3.6253,1.4804,1.0608,3.4734,3.2259,3.3008,4.4153,1.2091,2.2617,1.2309,1.6762,0.9481,4.8882,4.0052,5.5778,3.4684,1.8472,1.4915,0.8006,4.4636,0.4204,2.3545,0.1483,3.1359,1.8152,0.0405,4.2841,1.0919,4.7246,1.4862,0.4876,2.364,3.1973,1.7635,0.7037,4.9324,3.3635,2.532,1.7913,1.9943,0.0618,1.8236,1.4556,1.6383,2.8626,1.0818,4.0342,4.0451,2.7105,5.7569,1.9606,4.0261,1.0122,1.2361,5.2799,1.1279,0.6222,0.7241,5.6687,0.5455,8.1209,0.9608,3.7243,5.2299,0.4444,8.5713,0.5944,1.8936,2.6148,0.5793,0.0539,1.2373,1.1733,0.1502,1.9114,5.4112,1.0288,0.6696,1.8093,5.248,0.7962,1.7033,0.3035,3.7154,4.1241,4.2281,3.9797,7.088,1.9581,2.929,2.2205,5.6927,5.8074,2.621,2.2014,1.8731,4.4163,6.3294,1.4505,2.0733,5.6727,0.8614,3.2972,0.2287,2.713,0.865,0.3559,5.3606,1.063,1.3051,4.6151,1.0662,1.0435,3.0894,0.9921,1.9427,1.2543,2.2575,4.9515,4.446,6.472,5.3239,2.9534,0.0263,0.011,3.9462,2.0232,0.232,5.6749,0.2935,0.1762,5.1102,1.9096,7.6296,0.0434,7.0521,4.8306,1.6383,5.275,2.7366,4.0775,2.0172,0.5499,0.7023,5.1641,4.7063,1.7574,4.3944,2.5061,5.4881,4.5682,2.5487,1.1283,3.1976,0.159,1.074,7.2464,2.9306,3.4758,2.0166,5.8914,4.4836,4.8755,5.4723,1.7215,0.2744,1.4628,0.4437,5.9582,1.1926,1.2104,3.7465,3.7645,6.7176,2.8256,0.7372,0.6329,0.5576,0.5045]}
{"prompt":"The Olympic Games now have one average person compete in each event , to better contrast the skill of the athletes . You 're one of those average people , however no-one , including yourself , can figure out how you 're absolutely dominating your event .","text":"The Olympic Games now have one average person compete in each event, to better contrast the skill of the athletes. You're one of those average people, however no-one, including yourself, can figure out how you're absolutely dominating your event. It's like you just created a whole other set of competitors, with each event competing against itself. You're going to be able to make it to the top of the Olympic podium.\nThe Olympics have become this great global showcase for athletic excellence. They're also great for promoting the sport, which has become hugely influential on the way people behave and live.\nThe Olympic movement has evolved so much, it's now even popular as a means of personal development. It helps people understand a bit about their own inner strength, and helps people know that they have great potential.\nBut as with all things in the world, there is a double edged sword to the Olympic spirit. You can use it in a great way, but you can also abuse it if you put yourself way out of your depth and try to do things way too much. The more people that compete and put themselves out there, the more they can be exploited. That's when the Olympics can become a bit of a business, which I would personally hate.\nThe Olympics also bring people together from different cultures and countries, in one beautifully organized event. It helps people appreciate that they could be able to live together in peace and prosperity as one world.\nBut you still have to be careful and take the time to think things through. You don't want to go to the Olympics, and be completely out of your depth, in all your event and lose. The one person you should really watch over is yourself.\nThe Olympic Games have become a beautiful symbol of peace and friendship. They give people from all over the world the chance to meet for the first time, and find out about different cultures and peoples. The Olympics also bring people from different countries together to enjoy a peaceful time together, and to try and do their best in their sports.\nYou can also take those Olympics spirit, and use it to improve the world. Many sports don't have any negative repercussions, and instead it's all about trying to achieve high levels of success. If people can achieve that, they can get to a better place in the world.","token_len":471,"entropy":[10.0639,1.5444,7.2561,2.4412,4.6389,11.5297,3.4346,9.1142,0.7901,3.4915,2.7246,1.4562,5.7789,6.0603,6.8656,1.3556,7.1674,1.5516,1.479,1.983,1.3596,5.7873,4.2773,6.6402,0.8886,2.0365,6.3965,0.7783,1.7754,6.0135,7.959,4.1385,0.0539,4.6605,2.9323,3.3601,0.263,1.8616,6.0243,0.0604,0.9258,3.2234,1.6958,10.8677,5.6555,2.5298,5.7643,0.5731,3.1914,0.4462,2.9014,2.3378,4.4378,6.2839,0.8189,4.501,4.0216,4.3869,0.0658,7.2758,1.6734,3.3827,3.0952,4.3302,4.4569,2.7901,3.2463,0.6325,2.5806,1.524,4.1361,0.1452,2.1692,2.9307,0.0043,3.8459,2.6818,1.8436,0.4265,1.8131,1.8595,0.6447,4.3239,3.8928,2.0075,1.0217,8.4946,2.7382,1.9986,2.8911,4.5068,4.5455,6.1943,4.1157,0.536,5.704,1.041,0.9795,3.1026,1.1456,4.0657,3.3223,1.9374,4.4423,2.1955,1.522,2.4096,2.619,2.6287,1.8012,6.1193,4.4486,3.8927,1.2871,3.7536,1.7462,6.0332,2.3214,2.5246,1.3817,1.7673,2.3316,2.455,5.2979,1.1679,3.5845,3.6332,0.8155,2.8147,2.4785,0.4618,2.771,4.9664,7.1305,4.4984,0.569,3.4346,0.3777,6.2963,3.6978,0.6173,2.1008,6.1152,1.6269,2.3698,4.8089,4.3034,1.7053,2.4214,2.0507,5.1125,2.9937,1.2112,1.6349,5.123,2.3065,5.1217,1.6269,1.1281,2.4315,4.7407,0.7437,0.7896,1.144,4.2715,4.1598,3.8554,1.9744,1.1736,2.152,3.5194,0.6246,0.2318,1.526,2.2017,1.4538,6.9442,3.3658,0.0137,4.0764,2.7229,1.6452,3.5211,0.4268,2.7483,1.9229,4.8828,0.9437,3.6382,1.5815,4.828,0.1104,0.882,0.6629,1.2821,1.6004,1.1219,5.1002,0.0377,4.4099,0.2684,6.7984,2.9705,7.608,1.7637,0.3381,2.2221,1.8476,2.1997,3.8521,0.153,3.0923,1.8338,6.622,0.6957,1.8769,0.3405,3.2708,3.8236,2.8048,3.106,5.5688,3.4219,4.9131,0.2071,1.2992,1.4771,0.4634,0.0533,0.4909,1.8292,3.4021,2.3926,4.3897,0.7383,3.5691,0.4113,4.568,1.5512,2.4576,4.4097,1.6246,0.9234,4.5642,0.7616,0.2325,7.1772,1.9505,3.4959,3.1497,3.9753,5.9946,4.6272,1.603,0.536,2.3184,1.553,3.6846,3.8161,2.9383,0.2853,5.4347,2.2341,2.3891,1.2964,4.1744,1.2665,4.586,5.0833,9.7881,3.0888,2.1539,0.4151,1.874,4.1086,2.0648,5.3162,3.1275,2.6285,5.142,1.2948,6.2199,0.0041,4.2109,2.762,1.0467,3.1424,0.8575,3.9772,4.0127,3.9729,5.6228,1.1509,1.0406,4.1135,3.3946,4.3914,0.7411,0.3823,2.1758,2.7021,3.7433,4.9187,2.603,1.7061,0.1216,3.2067,5.7604,0.075,0.7399,2.1798,2.7583,0.0004,0.5199,0.2811,3.8541,2.5719,1.2234,0.5651,2.8236,2.3356,5.8038,4.7846,2.8548,0.1722,1.1957,0.4819,1.9728,4.7011,4.8644,3.3879,10.7727,4.0603,10.6469,2.4271,3.1455,6.2144,4.1029,1.9579,2.6844,3.1986,4.6112,3.2896,3.1931,2.3802,0.4472,1.0646,2.3524,2.333,1.6503,2.1012,2.2843,1.1449,5.6306,2.8633,0.3592,3.7226,0.5072,6.0164,1.0017,2.6672,4.0318,0.8547,5.2602,0.841,1.053,0.0521,0.0437,1.7442,0.8997,0.0145,3.5659,5.6219,1.0494,0.0297,0.0011,1.4482,1.1531,5.4489,1.1974,2.2853,4.5081,1.3267,0.6803,4.4368,1.0176,2.9506,1.9503,1.5182,1.8921,0.9529,3.2967,1.9502,1.5555,0.5715,1.5105,4.2066,2.0246,3.4441,2.1537,0.8979,1.6548,1.3857,1.9964,4.6862,2.1956,3.9043,3.1627,0.2899,2.5184,1.7033,6.0641,0.3112,0.5919,3.5388,1.106,2.7052,3.681,4.3762,5.1074,8.3748,3.6458,0.5405,2.2404,0.1347,0.9985,4.8505,1.9992,2.4427,1.1043,6.3186,4.4826,4.7239,0.0002,1.0844,2.8843,7.0056,3.6776,1.3114,1.4072,5.5222,5.1953,0.8988,2.2978,0.4805,4.7134,0.1391,4.2572,5.4369,2.2431,0.0262,1.4862,0.6564,3.9048,4.039,2.3743,3.7043,2.6081,0.6616,1.6719,1.0762,3.3594,1.9326,3.0157,3.1459,0.3429,1.8101,1.7899,0.2265,0.409]}

{"prompt":"earth gets a passive aggressive letter from the rest of the universe ...","text":"earth gets a passive aggressive letter from the rest of the universe... well, at least the Earth is still here.)\nLarry (whose name is Larry) and his family live happily in a suburban house in a suburb. One day, in his backyard, he's given a tree a shotgun. While playing house, the tree says, \"I'm going to kill a bee, and I'll be right back.\" But he doesn't. He shoots Larry. He shoots Larry's brother. He shoots the kid with the shotgun. He shoots several children in the house. He shoots Larry's dog. Then he shoots himself in the head. Larry is dead.\nMeanwhile, in the house, we hear a young girl screaming like she's been kidnapped by aliens. She says, \"He shot me in the back, and I'm dead.\" She screams for her parents. They answer the phone, and her mom tells her not to talk to strangers. She asks who the damn kid is. Her dad says a tree just shot him with a shotgun. All her friends are crying, and they tell her not to worry about it. She says she doesn't get it. Her dad says he'll have to talk to the police, so he leaves the house. As he's leaving, he is shot by Larry in the head. The gun was a.22 cal rifle. The shooter was not the tree.\nThen we see a police sketch of Larry, and we hear a narrator say, \"It was Larry. He shot him with a.22 rifle, and then he shot himself with that same.22 rifle.\"\nNowhere does this exist on the Internet. It's a real book. It's a fantasy horror that I call the Tree Shot. I wrote it in the second grade. I wasn't very good at telling a good story, but this one was really terrible. I thought about it a lot. I even thought about putting my name on it. But I didn't like my own name. And the idea of putting my name on a story just gave me a terrible headache. So when I was reading it, I said to myself, \"Larry, go back and change the name. You're obviously not ready for the world.\" Then I thought, \"What are the other kids going to think if the name is Larry?\"","token_len":473,"entropy":[8.5647,2.5733,9.645,8.5541,11.4888,2.2486,1.3545,5.4384,0.0362,0.3601,5.269,5.1724,5.6414,0.4665,3.0419,0.0532,3.2117,5.4168,1.6723,3.71,4.3514,6.6195,0.7991,13.7998,4.5694,6.2043,1.691,1.2093,4.7953,3.0065,2.6568,2.1431,3.8454,3.2273,7.0654,2.7586,1.5656,4.9582,2.2576,0.9958,2.8748,2.5027,3.7658,5.1866,0.9291,0.4698,4.8063,2.9058,4.7556,0.138,1.3652,4.2167,5.4285,0.8484,6.9332,2.0496,10.6921,1.9848,5.0667,4.2392,8.8881,1.926,3.2032,1.5929,5.1586,1.1959,0.077,2.8451,1.8428,1.4699,0.1295,1.8782,3.8033,5.4965,2.5823,1.7381,1.6502,2.0392,3.2798,3.9547,0.2459,0.9067,4.4582,3.0015,1.9009,0.0006,1.9135,1.684,3.6161,9.1089,2.176,2.2827,2.4646,1.0463,2.0146,2.7784,1.3005,1.5041,0.2803,2.5064,5.4579,4.273,1.5502,0.5979,0.4992,1.459,0.371,6.9132,4.1588,2.6249,0.7893,2.1935,0.7824,1.1396,0.3305,1.7802,0.4286,4.8011,0.7457,4.9744,0.5147,0.4249,4.2483,1.6886,0.0554,0.5373,1.118,2.6191,2.6494,2.1363,0.3431,1.0005,6.1637,0.135,2.216,1.1665,4.4492,0.5213,5.7152,2.1459,1.3501,5.2068,2.0631,1.8305,5.7628,2.4258,0.5948,3.0463,3.4356,1.3506,2.3394,0.3281,1.6957,3.3411,0.8126,0.0147,4.3235,4.069,0.7158,2.9353,0.0448,3.5419,1.908,0.9835,0.7675,1.0284,1.2117,0.7831,1.9216,3.8592,3.1374,1.5796,2.6342,1.2298,2.3399,5.8132,2.6545,0.7024,1.6599,0.7382,4.1722,2.6497,2.6941,1.104,3.5609,0.0014,2.6162,0.4525,4.2226,0.623,1.2647,3.2516,4.6966,2.3377,8.2804,3.8473,0.378,0.6768,3.9737,1.8933,1.2579,5.3469,7.8289,5.4698,3.3565,1.7349,4.3833,0.5382,0.3315,0.3989,5.944,3.8491,1.1756,1.6905,3.4985,1.8324,1.2084,2.2683,3.364,0.1926,2.341,0.0015,3.1118,1.3509,1.1988,0.2935,1.3098,1.9727,1.4734,3.1212,0.0005,5.5862,1.4888,0.4287,3.3181,1.9477,1.0616,1.4505,2.8006,4.2439,0.7632,3.4019,0.0643,1.6666,1.4225,2.1889,3.209,1.1776,3.7571,1.841,0.7783,0.5555,5.035,1.4216,2.4204,0.4761,0.2898,1.1241,4.8602,2.1492,1.7063,4.5002,3.2697,0.0658,1.2949,0.553,2.5641,4.233,4.2693,3.595,8.2022,9.5436,6.7686,3.2782,0.7836,2.2738,4.1342,2.2158,3.6689,3.4501,2.6916,0.6909,1.7006,5.0268,2.2551,1.0401,1.6336,5.155,8.1732,0.5996,1.1619,2.0361,2.007,2.6213,2.6402,1.6918,9.8274,1.2292,0.4142,0.0379,3.665,1.6326,3.2256,2.2307,1.1914,0.8162,2.2927,1.9315,0.3805,4.9171,0.023,4.7516,2.1997,0.5317,3.8867,0.7847,0.8127,1.031,1.9437,4.4402,4.6101,3.2397,0.0677,2.2254,1.2686,1.8668,4.3651,5.6584,2.0402,1.5432,6.9198,4.5761,0.8566,3.2477,0.5768,2.5043,0.7475,2.586,4.7462,5.896,1.0816,1.4206,0.3924,1.5176,5.428,8.4827,5.3425,3.6065,6.1938,2.4653,7.5594,7.8924,0.8386,2.5509,3.8641,0.8352,2.2196,2.1335,5.9979,1.3707,0.8111,1.3444,5.8486,0.0005,3.6584,0.4234,0.166,6.2555,3.7726,2.6005,0.134,1.0893,1.2212,4.0915,2.2658,1.8515,4.1809,7.105,0.1828,1.7357,3.8584,3.884,1.2365,2.5461,0.1941,0.8127,1.112,6.1984,2.8681,0.2069,3.6839,3.5436,3.5882,0.8402,0.6366,0.5005,2.7904,1.2796,1.9703,0.0006,3.0921,5.4952,3.33,1.6438,0.5063,3.2018,3.0778,4.3296,0.7266,2.7775,0.9702,0.2498,0.1628,1.2249,3.6352,3.8322,5.1099,0.1686,1.2288,4.0354,1.5157,0.2077,2.9041,3.6726,0.4352,2.9051,3.7241,1.5685,0.4344,0.3437,3.3772,2.8212,0.0719,0.131,0.2689,6.3592,0.4163,6.3361,2.2811,1.6247,6.0459,1.8931,0.3569,1.8832,2.654,1.6158,7.5801,1.2367,6.4445,0.7389,2.2802,2.881,2.2155,4.5819,0.3333,3.1031,0.854,0.2572,2.529,3.5357,2.8344,3.3896,1.8991,0.964,0.0087,1.8784,3.4735,3.6888,1.8552,1.5196,1.7986,0.5228]}

When he tries to order something from the menu, an aggressive server demands that the man put two more dollars in the restaurant register. The man refuses, and the server kicks over a counter to throw the man.\nThe man is killed while on the ground.

This time, he knows that, just like the time of the first murder, the cop and the media won't look closely enough to realize that this second murder is also the work of a man who committed a murder that happened a decade before.\nAs in the first film, this one is also based on a true story of a serial killer that killed young women.\nAs you watch this film, you realize that, although you were not born during the era of serial killers, you are more than likely one of his victims.","token_len":473,"entropy":[8.5972,5.375,7.0077,5.9304,3.4426,6.7661,3.1503,0.6641,7.1616,3.2558,0.2252,1.4875,6.7103,0.7843,1.3027,6.5974,6.3936,0.391,5.8272,12.5956,3.0272,0.1443,7.6965,0.1951,0.516,5.1173,0.0111,2.7435,2.7271,6.815,2.827,0.5363,1.2131,5.6344,2.491,5.9724,0.1133,4.7101,1.9403,6.4894,3.0557,0.7348,2.0894,13.1659,4.7194,3.7722,3.1117,3.0931,0.8133,0.0974,0.0015,0.7809,3.4925,7.8898,1.3087,1.8085,3.0813,10.624,0.0099,1.5062,2.899,4.7105,1.7244,0.0063,2.683,3.5911,3.583,3.4976,1.2056,3.647,1.8895,5.1996,1.1031,3.0351,3.0243,0.3592,5.3532,1.3008,4.1662,7.6061,4.7922,4.5186,8.1097,0.0188,0.0002,0.0262,1.0681,6.7361,0.0336,1.8233,3.0994,7.7172,1.1037,7.109,0.0054,0.3968,2.1536,1.3613,1.7612,1.6012,1.3061,0.0461,5.5605,1.2289,2.0076,2.3504,0.0844,4.238,2.0136,4.8396,0.7025,3.3668,0.0119,3.9842,1.4124,3.2044,0.2256,1.8392,0.9691,1.0647,5.3377,6.1033,0.5791,2.9235,0.9106,8.5966,1.4851,2.6911,2.1546,0.2733,0.1165,2.7593,0.3978,3.624,4.5054,6.9406,0.2728,2.8047,3.2143,3.7867,4.4352,6.9258,0.8285,0.0155,4.1751,6.5021,2.4333,4.3309,2.4949,2.8788,3.8241,1.6119,0.3939,2.1544,3.0214,3.4592,0.111,8.2336,0.7296,3.9323,4.2225,2.7417,5.2324,1.5245,4.5629,1.7374,3.1818,1.0205,4.4074,0.0594,4.6124,2.6719,2.977,0.7951,1.2054,0.145,4.0246,6.3717,8.2066,5.293,1.192,2.1525,0.4374,4.634,6.2726,7.6559,4.7103,1.1693,1.6265,4.7888,4.5227,0.3471,1.2182,0.5671,3.0056,1.3734,1.6029,1.2085,3.0301,4.8248,7.729,2.4683,2.1345,2.2852,4.8859,0.968,1.144,4.1817,1.8147,1.9178,1.1549,1.7677,5.1285,5.5992,3.9365,0.993,4.5261,0.5802,3.433,1.1053,1.0285,2.5728,4.7441,3.201,0.5649,1.6595,4.3726,4.5148,0.8043,0.8053,4.8496,2.4279,1.1504,6.263,0.011,8.2666,0.076,3.2539,8.1695,1.2725,4.9655,2.2744,5.4482,2.4794,0.6964,0.6122,2.6177,3.7082,6.1392,0.4879,0.0392,0.2875,0.5689,3.4076,1.1769,5.2513,2.7936,0.3228,0.1225,1.6121,2.1106,6.5295,1.1252,4.332,4.0371,4.3389,4.6298,1.2631,2.1611,1.0117,3.5718,6.0712,0.4309,2.801,1.5215,1.0308,5.7588,2.7966,0.9435,2.8517,4.2531,5.4513,0.6067,1.2636,2.8554,6.7492,3.2453,0.5496,1.2899,6.8805,5.5193,0.3229,0.2674,6.3482,1.2437,3.5681,0.1836,1.5013,1.5381,4.8863,1.8642,1.1882,1.8197,4.2373,1.8141,4.6387,4.5047,0.1201,1.6159,4.2138,1.6581,1.0704,3.3651,1.365,1.2169,1.1947,2.2006,4.834,0.8455,5.4813,2.2876,0.2959,4.3139,1.0276,5.3363,1.149,0.7025,6.4114,1.41,0.5034,7.5803,0.3076,0.2741,0.0297,0.0274,1.6044,4.2333,0.1018,7.9304,0.0005,1.1723,2.0231,0.4714,0.5076,8.1028,0.1629,0.5716,0.0439,1.7609,6.2712,4.3307,7.1199,0.3442,1.7514,4.5544,0.5364,0.1821,0.0118,2.7968,2.5901,2.0407,4.9689,5.1583,3.5005,0.2677,3.2717,0.6916,0.3434,1.6258,5.4964,2.0118,2.0394,4.0483,1.3227,0.8279,4.7319,2.7962,0.4403,3.1656,2.1046,0.2438,0.7395,5.234,5.5179,0.4267,0.4859,5.1199,0.0065,5.5149,4.84,1.4648,2.3763,5.9042,0.6492,2.7401,7.1596,0.7928,1.3126,3.886,1.8892,3.978,0.0133,1.3728,3.7405,1.2411,5.5668,1.7709,2.6236,3.092,3.4599,2.6698,2.5581,1.889,0.4957,0.5083,4.377,4.9249,0.4845,1.3699,5.2288,0.1231,2.8634,4.555,1.437,4.8591,2.8844,0.1577,1.2408,3.0662,0.3434,2.5459,1.4626,1.4022,0.0572,3.4822,4.0516,4.9658,0.5742,0.81,1.7923,4.08,3.386,3.3516,1.1734,1.4366,0.2355,0.4685,3.4366,0.4666,1.7939,4.783,2.2657,4.157,2.924,4.8272,5.5738,0.5358,3.6856,0.2726,2.0407,0.473,0.1676,0.8069,1.4864,5.4249,2.0991,1.6033,3.4454,0.1576,7.5311,0.2599,0.2829]}
{"prompt":"A strange virus spreads across the earth killing everyone but heavy smokers .","text":"A strange virus spreads across the earth killing everyone but heavy smokers. This has happened before in our history and people who haven't smoked at all have been spared. Our government has banned smoking everywhere and in all public places. We don't feel the same about our own lives. Every day and night we are trying to find meaning and satisfaction in our lives. We are afraid that if we don't try and be positive, we will die. We try to avoid going into stressful situations that cause us stress. Life is full of stress, and we try to avoid it as much as possible. We do our best to keep things peaceful and calm. Most people spend a large percentage of their lives working so that the day at work isn't as stressful as their personal lives, but we struggle with balance.\nWhat is the point of our lives if we don't enjoy those few things we enjoy, then our lives are only half lived.\nWe have all heard the old saying, \"Be thankful for what you have.\" But it is sometimes difficult. For example, I have a wonderful husband and many wonderful children, and yet I still battle daily with insecurity about my body and my job. I am an adult, an educated woman, but I have to work with children that range in age from 2 to 7, all day and night. I still carry guilt about not working as hard as I should, and I don't believe that I deserve success. I think I have to do better, and I have to get better, so that I can deserve success.\nI have a huge list of things I want to do. The reason people struggle with this is because they have not taken the time to ask themselves why they are going to accomplish something. They haven't been curious about what they need in order to be happy.\nThe question is not whether you want to change. The question is, should you change? If you are not changing, that means that nothing is going to occur. You have to decide if you want to be happy and be who God created you to be, or if you are going to carry a load of past hurts, fears, and unhappiness into your future. Your decision to allow yourself to live your life in fear or to embrace the joy and the beauty of who God created you to be, will determine your future.","token_len":473,"entropy":[10.1303,9.2935,6.2255,4.762,0.9327,5.3309,9.0597,4.3091,4.101,12.2465,5.0509,0.8333,3.9472,4.1252,3.9265,2.0609,1.6616,4.3933,2.6176,2.0383,5.6801,2.7475,5.0914,0.0008,0.8505,5.1052,0.298,1.6639,1.5408,6.4205,0.9462,5.7864,3.1902,1.6675,4.5386,0.7402,4.9873,2.5226,4.1699,3.1848,2.0222,0.3603,0.9816,2.6272,3.122,0.0004,6.1967,2.3468,3.0045,2.3287,3.498,3.5654,5.0974,1.1396,5.5655,1.9671,5.871,1.9953,0.8291,2.0757,5.6495,0.0724,3.1584,6.4244,1.9218,6.8465,0.518,1.4407,0.5045,0.6416,1.7102,1.8407,4.8465,1.9328,1.9637,0.1556,1.32,0.0007,3.9679,3.4363,3.8971,3.8803,1.4649,0.9597,0.6488,2.6149,0.7995,1.6302,4.3687,0.4345,3.7786,4.5905,3.2841,9.2434,0.14,3.1339,3.519,0.6094,3.8253,0.7517,6.4858,0.578,3.4815,0.0409,3.1288,1.9812,1.8539,1.4418,2.5782,0.2575,1.6657,1.128,3.2184,0.3296,0.0174,0.3653,0.1746,1.6039,3.6995,3.0865,0.109,0.2663,3.3776,3.1478,3.3723,1.1036,3.4083,0.8144,5.5323,1.6619,6.1155,1.8599,4.5871,4.0883,0.0014,0.0363,2.2983,4.7238,5.1412,1.5124,4.2326,4.3623,6.4966,1.7044,4.3844,0.0007,3.5707,0.2107,0.5705,6.2028,5.0471,1.8582,3.7582,1.0844,2.0052,5.8589,1.2633,8.6461,1.6518,2.7687,7.3076,1.7404,1.3953,4.2689,0.2644,4.8327,1.9715,0.4375,0.3035,1.0762,0.0007,4.3196,5.6412,5.184,3.1073,1.7136,1.0339,2.9905,5.1588,3.8929,1.8518,1.915,5.3153,4.5246,7.3543,1.3449,2.4052,2.4641,2.4115,4.1273,3.8037,1.0592,4.3074,0.4558,1.4105,0.376,5.1756,4.823,1.0736,1.1266,0.112,0.3658,1.6519,2.8242,3.1962,1.2298,5.9887,1.8301,5.1446,4.145,1.5464,0.15,2.5061,1.8168,1.9904,5.2827,3.101,1.2721,4.915,1.4415,0.3872,2.0345,1.5053,4.5149,1.0481,2.6716,9.5959,4.6801,0.8731,6.8305,2.239,1.3881,4.6448,1.3026,1.5833,3.6245,0.3649,1.175,2.4421,4.6088,3.8135,1.4956,5.5927,5.0359,2.0243,0.5306,3.0838,0.776,2.3642,2.0845,2.6206,4.1366,4.7604,4.0712,9.4174,0.8095,0.0798,0.0947,3.5597,0.5273,3.1068,2.4352,4.6203,4.1141,2.4787,1.3432,0.4748,1.1168,4.3396,6.4095,7.0976,1.5229,2.3452,4.3872,3.7232,0.811,0.2568,0.2367,2.2695,1.0296,1.479,1.0678,3.5761,0.0007,4.0913,1.1342,1.396,3.3437,6.4979,1.0028,1.0967,3.5449,1.9625,2.0609,2.1308,2.9852,1.31,1.6513,1.4424,0.748,2.4438,0.5839,3.4303,0.8746,2.6782,3.4994,1.5847,0.5819,0.6967,8.084,2.2259,0.4889,1.1234,1.7467,1.8495,1.9132,5.1761,5.3608,0.0334,2.1457,0.7769,1.337,0.2043,0.9175,2.365,4.0318,5.6581,5.4463,5.7434,0.5981,1.9878,0.5517,0.3799,1.0016,2.4111,3.7655,3.8443,1.5904,0.2837,0.1413,5.0362,1.1744,2.6648,0.4088,1.6544,4.5163,0.5395,5.4469,2.1087,1.2731,1.6801,5.0984,0.0004,2.7759,7.1363,0.7102,1.1784,0.9947,3.766,5.3251,0.459,0.039,2.8631,2.7802,0.7619,3.2025,3.0698,4.7375,1.2009,2.7016,2.3154,1.4453,2.0481,0.1734,4.677,3.4596,1.2568,0.0987,0.0139,1.6598,4.6971,0.1084,2.6315,1.6172,2.6123,0.363,2.3172,2.5064,4.358,0.4829,5.3191,2.4339,1.3495,6.5518,1.8078,1.4482,0.0287,7.8183,1.0292,3.1143,2.3104,0.9517,3.7084,1.9899,0.3369,0.4377,0.1842,2.2881,0.4074,3.1878,3.5236,5.9871,8.4804,3.9932,0.0735,0.042,0.0168,2.2928,0.5671,0.9445,0.1343,2.6099,0.8299,0.0105,7.6394,3.3024,3.1404,1.1498,9.1319,7.8156,3.0581,5.4757,0.5515,0.7879,5.6856,0.0008,3.2132,1.3202,1.3057,0.4297,5.0486,3.3092,1.938,7.156,1.8387,0.1209,4.1998,2.0922,0.2637,2.0026,3.1483,3.4588,2.8008,4.9281,1.6945,5.3287,2.3926,3.7303,4.2306,0.2849,6.4366,1.6449,0.2939,0.1371,0.1328,0.0255,2.3041,2.0864,3.0931,1.977,0.8422,0.5679]}

{"prompt":"Tell me how you discovered that you were a shapeshifter .","text":"Tell me how you discovered that you were a shapeshifter. I used to feel trapped being that I thought the only way to stay human was to hide or make sure everyone knew my true form. Now I just have to let people who matter know who I am.\nThe first time I discovered I was a shapeshifter was in middle school, in the 7th grade. I was sitting at the bathroom stall by myself, talking on the phone when I pulled out my cell phone. I saw them walk in with the locker that was in the cubicle next to mine. I\u2019m pretty sure that my dad was around so it didn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s pretty normal these days to be surrounded with little gossappers, but when I heard them talking about my ex-boyfriend that broke my heart a couple years ago- it really bothered me. So I pulled out my phone and got the first caller ID. I didn\u2019t even know who it was at the time but when I tried the number I knew it was him! It was hard to think of anyone I hadn\u2019t told him I was dating, but I was still feeling pretty crushed. I remember the look on his face, the way he looked at me- all of that was completely new to me.\nFor my second call ID I decided to start with an old school call that left years ago. I remembered that my mom had left her last voicemail, but I didn\u2019t remember the person on the other end of the line. My mom was very secretive, so all I had was the time and call number. I looked it up and saw it was the guy who stole my virginity. It was so hard to listen, but for the first time in all of those years I heard his voice. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears, he was on the other end of the line. He said that he was sorry and that he didn\u2019t mean to drag the number from my past into our present.

{"prompt":"Write about an epic battle of wits between two masters , then cut it short when one of them pulls out a handgun .","text":"Write about an epic battle of wits between two masters, then cut it short when one of them pulls out a handgun. If you want me for a director, you want me to be a writer. If I want to write something, I can write it to my heart's content. I'm not an activist.\nI've come to terms with the fact that people like your book, because I won't. I won't write a book about the murder of a young mother and her two young children. Because the mother had a gun and the murderers didn't.\nThe woman was murdered in her house, because she could not have bought a gun in any store that didn't belong to the police or the government. She was murdered in a house, with no witnesses. I don't care about that.\nI know all the facts. I know who did what. I know that the people are people with two kids, and they had some kind of a disagreement over a chicken.\nI don't pretend that I won't say what happened because if I don't say what happened, I haven't done my job, and it should not be enough that someone else has done it. I think that the book should end when the end is reached, in no uncertain voice.\nWell, maybe you haven't found enough material. If that's true, you and I can't have an editorial discussion. The only problem is that, for me, the matter is closed, and the reason lies at the very heart of my writing.\nThe reason is this: I write from the point of view of the girl, but I can't allow her to get away with what she's saying. I feel that she's guilty, but she may convince herself that what she's saying is true. So, I say to her in the book : \" Hey, you must be lying. Don't act like you don't know what you're doing, because that's not the truth either. You must know what you're doing. \" And then I tell her the truth, I tell her everything that happened.\nYou will find that I'm always honest with her. I don't want her to get away with lying, but I don't lie to her either. I tell her the truth. You can see that there's no problem with that.","token_len":475,"entropy":[6.0771,5.0779,7.7529,2.9922,2.3524,3.9458,0.0092,2.2117,2.1897,4.8426,2.4388,5.4926,6.5707,2.0807,1.6577,3.2498,4.0284,1.3357,0.4623,5.4614,1.3436,1.175,6.2213,1.7311,4.2751,0.7604,3.055,6.1992,7.8602,1.2774,9.1261,1.3527,2.1143,4.6044,1.0635,0.6866,2.0067,1.7701,3.0888,0.4824,2.6287,1.4288,2.1677,0.8969,1.8008,3.4182,1.3486,0.4956,3.7273,1.5873,1.523,5.5323,3.5277,1.953,0.3071,0.0496,0.3276,1.7913,1.896,1.255,3.7955,6.1483,1.0415,3.1477,8.7814,2.5436,4.8676,0.4169,3.9864,0.0563,1.274,0.2648,0.0282,4.7998,3.3218,6.1471,3.9259,1.6994,4.1835,1.9443,6.5108,0.129,5.6581,1.1194,2.3799,0.0002,2.377,2.0602,1.5271,1.2198,2.6856,5.3221,0.1133,1.6787,2.974,4.4595,2.6444,1.6629,2.7514,1.7648,0.6426,0.8168,4.749,3.4343,4.7931,3.9347,1.6575,2.865,1.8482,2.1797,8.2239,3.0708,0.0006,0.6712,2.2882,3.3867,5.4804,1.882,2.8722,2.3127,2.097,4.0707,1.7402,3.9631,1.1058,4.951,0.9617,2.9942,4.1764,0.9374,0.302,3.5396,5.3044,3.298,3.3099,4.1413,0.0008,5.3765,0.0104,2.5644,3.4664,3.3459,1.1221,3.5897,0.2653,2.2419,1.0787,1.6689,1.6753,1.664,3.5441,2.6567,5.3137,1.9198,6.3701,0.9632,2.6725,1.967,0.0005,2.2748,1.9056,2.3126,0.6027,2.4129,1.6663,3.5334,5.018,1.6077,3.8986,1.0187,0.6685,0.4347,3.6715,2.9459,2.6067,0.8881,0.5561,0.2484,2.3566,1.6856,3.417,5.591,6.4004,3.8606,6.3704,6.5582,1.5689,1.2606,1.8733,4.7212,5.0121,2.2488,0.0036,4.2887,4.9749,2.9361,4.0407,8.4341,1.8026,1.9017,1.5446,2.1069,0.0004,7.0511,1.6773,1.0395,4.6948,0.0095,3.8749,2.3252,2.2504,4.0149,4.3426,0.6347,2.8746,0.0004,2.3229,1.5223,0.2255,0.2798,1.2438,5.8879,0.0003,1.6562,1.9833,0.1207,2.8785,1.109,3.0986,5.8467,2.3755,1.0657,7.0704,3.627,3.2502,2.1261,2.0812,1.7716,1.0781,0.3167,1.5128,3.5122,1.5468,2.6468,4.6499,2.4036,6.0717,3.6726,1.8993,6.1299,1.608,0.8451,1.6577,4.4962,5.6936,1.0815,13.7911,0.5786,0.6263,5.6843,0.092,4.5154,2.9917,5.0422,0.0003,5.6523,5.4546,5.6579,1.713,3.5743,3.3529,0.6827,2.249,0.1141,2.4267,7.0909,0.4265,1.9366,3.0093,2.5681,3.3578,5.6553,3.8081,0.9676,3.8674,2.6457,5.2738,0.4372,0.6759,3.9211,3.5257,2.0125,0.1837,1.7367,7.1596,0.8755,5.6522,2.0836,0.9989,2.3079,6.3114,6.4742,4.6725,0.2167,2.6817,0.8203,0.0121,1.7038,2.7375,0.4619,0.6811,2.8417,3.9573,1.3558,3.3812,0.2938,1.2835,3.5322,5.6976,1.1439,1.5837,0.0263,0.012,0.0228,1.6485,7.2512,2.1969,4.5,1.0193,3.1633,0.2414,6.1982,1.9949,0.2087,3.5485,1.0747,0.1136,3.7389,0.2396,2.1275,2.9233,0.5389,1.331,4.8995,1.4301,2.2222,1.0348,5.4044,1.4695,2.7057,2.0293,5.7542,8.6077,1.0697,0.6096,3.8733,0.2911,0.7438,0.1254,0.2609,1.1173,0.5534,3.6455,1.7945,1.2584,3.935,1.9311,0.9086,5.0392,1.7681,2.8358,9.7473,0.9169,9.9153,0.2112,1.7665,5.0751,1.5302,4.3945,1.193,3.3064,0.0004,6.0249,0.3387,0.9219,1.9783,0.0004,1.0098,0.8371,0.6877,0.0581,1.5218,1.8799,0.992,2.9381,0.5065,1.8937,2.5931,3.6096,6.9778,0.7012,1.8691,2.3462,2.5511,1.1806,0.4337,0.1737,0.2731,1.1924,2.8029,2.7854,1.8253,1.5211,2.6057,0.0841,3.5106,0.6649,1.2168,4.272,0.9873,0.1119,4.5522,2.3867,4.55,1.4501,1.3082,3.1393,4.9872,2.3973,1.3297,2.0706,1.8977,4.9972,3.2488,1.852,2.1136,0.8342,1.0688,2.3231,0.0003,2.3576,1.3206,0.1279,3.044,1.0648,0.0528,3.1239,2.098,1.8295,0.6333,1.9821,0.0003,9.1808,1.2347,1.0178,4.4857,0.1598,1.0933,2.2214,0.1057,2.5635,0.2063,1.4233,3.6939,1.9378,4.16,1.0424,4.0859,0.8598,1.8315,4.3661,1.2879,1.1643,0.4078]}

{"prompt":"A day at work","text":"A day at work, there\u2019s a lot of information, a lot of emails to sort out, and the most time consuming things can be finding answers to questions and making decisions. The internet and search functions on your computer are great at sorting through information quickly and easily, but there is nothing like talking to someone on the phone and getting real answers to the questions or decisions you\u2019re trying to make.\nPeople have access to the internet around the world, anywhere and everywhere\u2014at home, at work, on the phone, while going for a walk, or while eating a lunch break. You\u2019ve probably never visited another country without having access to the internet, or perhaps you didn\u2019t even realize you were. Technology and the ability to use the internet are very important aspects of modern life, and the more you know about that, the more you have options, and the more your decisions are based on real information, instead of preconceived ideas.\nThe internet is everywhere. If you want to get help with decisions or answers to questions, the internet is the place to look. The Internet is a great source for learning about different subjects and can be particularly useful if you\u2019re trying to decide whether to buy certain products because you don\u2019t have other people to show you how to use them, or how to make decisions about things like which college to attend, the best work and professional opportunities, or the best way to handle tough situations.

It gives you information quickly and easily, and you can get the answers you need about things you have been wanting to know for what seems like a long time. If you\u2019ve decided you want to change jobs, for example, by reading on the internet you can see how new jobs would be like, where and when they are working, what to expect in the first week, what\u2019s involved, and what the pay is like.

{"prompt":"You see yourself as a loser , a nobody . Little did you know that the birds you feed everyday see you as something else entirely .","text":"You see yourself as a loser, a nobody. Little did you know that the birds you feed everyday see you as something else entirely. When a man is a loser, he can\u2019t ever love you enough \u2026\nWhat kind of man wants a wife who will not accept the fact that he is worthless to her. How can you have a good marriage when you do not give up your self esteem for a man. It is not easy to be with a man who has problems accepting his wife. What is wrong with a woman to expect that her man will love her above anything. Women have never been perfect. It will take a while for the man to accept her as the one, and not leave her for any other woman. A man that is really true can do that just because of the fact that you deserve it. The only thing I am saying here is if you want to be beautiful and to be loved for who you are then you better get rid of your pride and just let things happen.\nThis message is for all the men out there who do not understand how to treat a woman well enough but still do so. Sometimes the women is not responsible what so ever because the men is not understanding at all. It may take a while for her to realize that you are better than she thought. When a man has a man like that then he is just worthless. Women are not stupid. They may believe that because a man is not a materialistic man that he is not worth anything. Women are not stupid but the men are.\nWOMEN are born with three souls. One is the soul of her child, and another is their lover, and the other is their mother. The mother is the most beautiful, but the lover is the one who is to be taken care of. There should be something special about a man that makes him different than all the others. The man should be able to give a true love and treat a woman well. She should never leave her lover if she loves the man enough. You must make sure that the man you are giving your heart to really loves you enough.\nThe girl should never judge herself that bad, because she has nothing to worry about. A man should know how to treat a woman enough. If a girl is in love with the wrong guy then she can never be with a right guy afterwards.","token_len":478,"entropy":[6.0426,7.4108,2.5335,1.0455,7.7303,1.3029,2.692,7.3579,1.5167,8.883,2.9697,0.9128,0.0339,1.0177,3.3506,9.201,3.5056,3.9456,9.4336,7.5446,0.7438,0.2494,4.467,1.9515,3.6,1.088,4.476,3.8391,4.0055,2.7402,2.9563,0.3015,0.3364,0.9343,3.7453,17.6262,8.4996,2.4236,5.627,5.8183,0.8801,4.678,8.021,2.9141,8.1139,4.5539,0.0043,2.1742,5.0134,3.0819,3.5504,2.3254,3.0065,3.241,5.038,3.1415,2.0381,0.1,0.7384,1.4148,4.4497,3.8103,1.0702,4.0114,3.8922,1.8764,1.5315,3.5797,0.9041,3.7672,2.9009,2.4509,0.7018,4.4667,0.2992,3.8414,3.1666,1.4931,4.2822,3.275,2.9826,2.343,1.7558,4.6405,3.7084,0.8273,2.4208,3.7043,0.8311,2.2548,5.5924,0.8012,1.6465,0.5372,2.6084,7.2502,7.9728,1.5493,3.0105,1.271,3.7547,2.0197,5.0711,0.078,1.3059,2.0426,5.8055,5.0236,1.6732,2.6242,3.6638,0.4704,2.2785,0.1372,8.9325,4.7817,3.6506,5.0806,2.9922,4.3974,1.3368,5.2643,1.0588,3.1522,4.4058,1.6984,1.7834,3.0997,0.9328,2.6581,1.1361,0.2024,2.6611,1.6814,2.831,3.1408,4.0758,3.9205,2.1812,3.5818,7.3425,0.4695,2.7832,4.1672,1.1025,1.5814,0.408,3.7961,1.0068,4.444,1.9091,5.765,7.0541,4.5272,4.2812,2.476,5.5472,2.3551,3.3012,1.7413,1.5553,0.0667,4.4462,5.75,0.81,0.4507,3.4754,2.6686,1.5049,4.4526,2.9072,1.6246,2.5689,0.0888,4.8889,0.5586,1.9178,0.9798,1.5036,5.2162,1.6719,3.7246,1.1647,2.496,4.3019,1.3978,0.0313,0.1939,3.2034,0.6931,4.4865,2.8396,4.3496,0.0061,1.3841,3.8356,0.8448,4.8755,2.7281,5.6995,3.2766,0.8528,1.458,3.8201,5.4191,1.0668,3.4353,2.3615,2.7931,2.5716,1.4899,0.0139,1.2244,3.6278,0.1148,2.5066,2.1113,1.765,3.4435,2.3083,0.4562,4.1009,4.4953,6.31,2.4865,3.5906,4.9738,1.4193,6.4179,2.8042,3.067,6.9435,2.3031,7.9132,8.8627,6.7478,0.0531,4.1073,2.5626,1.7388,5.5266,1.9704,5.7406,5.645,0.1673,0.7159,2.7998,4.5358,2.5729,1.0305,0.8339,0.6564,5.3685,0.1402,2.6289,0.476,2.5337,0.5914,5.4262,0.4939,0.6044,2.5428,1.4733,3.6773,1.5577,0.6486,3.3402,1.4494,4.7305,3.6314,1.4865,2.8248,0.8917,1.4464,3.9318,6.5555,0.9608,4.3017,1.4526,1.4407,5.2493,0.8074,1.1212,4.141,4.4166,0.7077,3.8423,2.5726,0.622,0.9155,2.8814,2.356,9.2507,3.8932,2.0001,1.9291,0.9178,1.1587,1.8908,1.9524,2.6558,0.6878,3.1687,1.1177,1.4165,2.1834,3.8996,3.8586,2.5709,0.9238,0.834,2.0076,5.9735,3.9881,0.4515,4.7158,7.4474,1.377,6.6735,6.0438,0.9342,2.8304,1.2775,1.8026,3.5559,0.8512,6.0712,4.8248,1.5728,2.3621,3.6096,0.3509,6.3047,6.2756,2.0994,1.2061,1.2409,2.3211,1.5639,0.9037,1.8317,0.3353,1.4465,2.6444,0.8908,1.0245,3.8192,1.4982,2.5444,3.461,0.8047,2.0902,0.2551,0.8365,4.1736,0.8604,1.4317,5.7406,1.5896,4.3291,1.5419,0.0065,0.8264,4.3185,5.4774,0.3456,4.4837,3.2953,1.0525,1.2052,1.3939,1.5278,2.3442,0.5213,4.9426,1.875,3.7575,0.7386,1.1952,0.383,2.4355,2.1906,2.0354,1.0608,2.855,0.0105,3.9587,2.9291,4.4845,1.8063,2.1659,6.15,2.6562,0.1292,2.2586,0.9316,4.3261,0.6436,3.6478,4.3288,1.9094,2.5183,4.5916,0.7738,4.8918,3.9981,0.5374,4.1406,1.2172,4.4551,2.8231,3.8777,1.3829,0.3654,1.9016,0.9812,2.9473,2.1143,2.9372,2.6271,4.3233,0.9474,6.7657,3.2375,0.7888,4.4325,1.4623,1.4088,2.7651,6.0964,2.0513,2.4693,6.8932,4.3918,4.9262,8.5974,2.5865,1.4393,0.9122,2.8308,4.3405,0.685,3.5732,0.0106,0.4124,3.3658,1.5061,2.036,4.277,2.954,0.4027,1.3922,0.8949,0.8669,9.1167,1.8726,2.5415,1.9942,2.7162,1.6217,4.1644,0.8095,0.3113,3.4849,5.5469,2.8092,0.6181,0.6614,3.401,2.3707,1.7971,2.2722,2.9329,6.1901,0.4575,8.6011,0.1904]}

{"prompt":"Death of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse goes missing . The remaining three search for a human sadistic enough to take his place .","text":"Death of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse goes missing. The remaining three search for a human sadistic enough to take his place. No one has heard from the other three for over two months. A team of elite FBI agents go to the center of the matter. Is the killer still there?\nThe film follows the murder of a Hollywood actress, played by Charlize Theron. The FBI is called in to investigate the murder as well as find evidence about her husband\u2019s murder. Unfortunately for them, the actress was not only an actress and also an amateur porn star. She had multiple affairs. Her husband was going through bankruptcy which was also the reason for the murder. He wanted to use the actress in blackmail.\nThey are going through the FBI\u2019s computer system and they find videos of her. They also have to find another source of information \u2013 her phone records. This information would be more helpful for them. A very strange man approaches the police and starts telling them interesting things. He reveals the past. Before he was killed and buried, he used to rape and torture actresses who were similar to her. He made sure to leave clues behind so that his victims would know who he was.\nAt the end of the film, the three remaining Horsemen of the Apocalypse leave their human prey dead. The FBI agent tries to figure out what was going on. He becomes addicted to pornography. He begins to relive all the images of the actress that he once saw on the internet. He also becomes afraid.\nAfter another incident, the three Horsemen find him and kill him as well. However, the film fails to make an impact with viewers. The story is a bit predictable and some of the actors do not seem to be capable of their jobs. The plot is weak and the viewer does not get any real emotion from the movie. The story seems too fake.\nThe actress plays a different character on the video screen. It is not clear if she murdered her husband or she just pretended to.\nIt is a really funny movie. The screenplay is good and makes you laugh throughout the movie. It seems like a bit of a cop show, but it is still kind of good.\nThe best part for me was the end. It kept the viewer in the movie at all times and made us think about things that we were supposed to think.","token_len":480,"entropy":[3.5626,1.6075,7.859,2.5283,0.0232,3.554,1.4882,2.1261,9.1983,7.8134,1.722,2.4311,6.1239,3.2066,9.493,0.4086,3.1863,5.2906,13.0277,1.4914,9.2061,0.0731,3.5305,3.802,1.705,1.355,5.8527,0.9091,2.8366,4.0843,1.9853,2.1198,2.7239,1.3568,3.948,3.1377,2.5645,2.4893,0.7996,4.252,5.3428,0.3193,5.7867,6.2437,0.2869,4.7252,1.1443,1.7484,7.0705,0.3192,0.8565,7.3361,1.7177,6.2198,2.3119,5.1905,2.7227,2.462,0.262,2.4014,5.6892,5.1085,3.6872,1.053,5.1881,0.2377,2.5714,7.7107,3.002,1.6409,5.0271,0.0282,5.5582,0.0079,0.0004,0.0,1.0408,1.4646,3.8336,2.4408,3.5469,0.8941,0.5021,1.1345,1.612,2.0494,4.0722,1.3016,0.4623,3.4835,3.8029,4.3529,3.4849,3.5788,14.3523,8.5118,5.0661,2.795,0.3735,5.4682,1.6464,3.4096,0.1811,1.4584,4.8807,3.2627,2.2785,4.3652,4.1881,2.1233,3.7621,6.2133,2.4883,5.7088,5.6186,0.557,0.9648,1.6332,2.3653,6.4506,5.4344,2.332,2.8322,1.5209,1.3849,6.9744,1.8962,5.8166,5.7547,2.4685,4.4202,2.873,0.8952,1.8405,1.2339,3.0369,0.5562,4.5457,3.9824,0.4419,4.5539,1.6887,4.5271,3.4054,4.6781,1.5318,2.1792,5.129,2.7011,4.9437,3.7356,1.5138,4.499,11.4394,0.3147,0.1402,5.156,1.5513,1.7055,3.0676,1.6105,8.2731,0.4752,2.2779,3.1152,1.542,2.484,3.2294,4.1647,2.0507,5.6877,4.488,1.1712,1.2586,7.2546,2.7709,4.235,3.0673,0.4371,3.4079,3.0679,4.0821,2.215,5.2766,3.3104,2.2406,1.6455,2.0919,4.5905,4.9393,4.204,3.332,6.0218,1.1667,4.0472,1.8054,4.2258,4.0782,0.1639,9.7679,1.0813,0.9724,1.5812,4.9809,2.8837,7.3244,2.8481,6.6871,1.3514,4.5197,3.0245,4.163,5.6295,1.8158,0.8317,3.5769,0.714,6.833,1.6779,2.7537,4.2431,3.4367,1.2042,7.4486,0.2722,4.2544,0.3611,1.1779,4.52,3.7346,1.3044,4.7457,5.6407,3.4426,2.9708,0.9974,2.8689,1.5606,1.0399,1.7898,2.2521,0.5804,0.3053,0.7681,1.4989,5.0956,0.9143,1.1016,0.1652,0.1957,0.3256,0.3185,1.1755,4.5786,6.2988,6.6742,0.0097,1.2834,0.1066,0.0021,3.7975,2.9388,5.4129,7.5805,3.8071,0.6097,1.5012,3.0918,5.1701,5.6006,0.1047,4.8138,0.0435,1.1953,3.5225,0.749,0.0258,1.0422,1.5548,6.2723,7.3023,0.0839,3.0348,1.0303,0.9364,4.2175,0.5674,7.2218,0.0584,3.1679,0.9673,7.1935,1.405,1.537,4.2601,2.5058,0.6108,4.3734,2.2539,2.7225,1.4404,1.898,0.3015,0.9028,3.2157,3.3718,6.1108,2.6928,2.46,3.7654,6.4418,5.0437,0.9813,0.8856,2.2881,2.0006,0.0045,4.7297,5.4564,2.0166,2.5768,0.0562,5.059,0.4195,0.2091,3.9973,0.1058,1.4344,3.3232,4.5096,0.3962,3.2674,4.1559,1.4382,4.8197,4.0766,0.5637,1.5828,4.0714,1.8389,3.3701,2.5665,5.0134,1.6052,5.4401,1.2509,0.1232,3.5467,3.3322,1.0776,1.8745,0.3424,2.1706,5.7779,0.0816,5.7651,3.5838,0.3746,1.5904,3.8947,1.1591,5.5984,0.9339,1.2777,6.9698,2.3298,0.0399,1.6661,2.8494,1.9196,5.6335,1.3913,0.5179,1.8721,0.1521,1.5011,3.1005,5.0548,3.944,7.6733,2.2244,1.184,1.3686,7.0213,5.9291,1.1479,4.341,1.2228,4.207,0.5312,6.9866,4.7979,0.5721,3.5714,0.7431,1.8081,1.7344,1.3934,0.586,10.2633,1.9261,0.2423,0.8224,3.7513,2.5165,5.0361,0.3119,4.6895,2.5935,3.6935,0.5704,3.4927,5.2583,3.8407,1.2478,0.6477,1.5187,6.4173,0.6948,2.8296,0.9185,5.4109,2.8571,1.6031,5.9442,0.8083,0.7706,0.1162,1.9104,4.3516,1.2263,1.739,4.9938,0.3064,0.4098,6.9392,1.44,2.6109,0.5901,1.0853,1.0281,3.4357,5.4398,0.0089,3.9729,0.4059,1.3375,1.6101,5.1393,0.4492,3.9584,0.5955,1.6979,1.5063,5.1861,2.3445,2.1401,6.7917,1.9603,3.1671,2.7092,1.4398,4.137,5.1464,2.7414,0.0508,2.6072,2.2041,3.6559,3.1494,0.9348,4.5067,1.3092,1.6573,3.1336,4.2363,0.0014,2.5076,3.3622]}
{"prompt":"Writing Exercise : Start your story with , `` Get to the courtyard ! '' and continue writing without taking time to pause and think . Just keep writing even if at times you only produce gibberish .","text":"Writing Exercise : Start your story with, `` Get to the courtyard! '' and continue writing without taking time to pause and think. Just keep writing even if at times you only produce gibberish. Continue to compose until you can find some sense in your written discourse.\n3. Read your composition and check that the beginning, middle and end are properly interlinked. There should be a clear purpose and a satisfying ending - what you wanted to write about is clearly expressed.\nStart with the question, what is the topic of the text? Write it on another piece of paper separately from the exercise. Write your text, trying first to express the main idea in your own words. There is no time for a detailed analysis of a work of art, so be honest and simple, try to express how you experience a work of art. In other words, you are not supposed to try to be an expert, and you certainly should not try to write a great work of literature, but only a simple and sincere narrative.\nThen try to express your thinking on a work of literature by means of a simple composition. Try to use your own terminology as much as possible. Don't worry - there is no requirement for a formal analysis, the composition of the text should be quite simple ( even if it is somewhat artificial ) in order to express clearly your own thinking. This is a very important requirement, because you will be asked to write a simple commentary about a work of art. If you can't think of a meaningful topic for such a composition, try to ask someone whom you trust to give you some good advice for writing a meaningful composition.\nAs an alternative, you may choose to write, for example, `` The title is ambiguous, which part of his work is most interesting? '' or, for example, `` Which parts of his work seem most interesting? What are his own ideas? '' or even by other examples ( there are a number of good examples of such compositions in texts, if you don't like those topics, for example, you can ask from a friend for an idea of a possible composition ) or you may also choose to analyze the titles of some parts of a work of art.\nYou can start the composition from some given examples of works of art. Think about these examples - whether they interest you, and if so, which parts do you like the most?","token_len":481,"entropy":[11.5592,5.8943,6.7138,3.1282,7.2791,1.7187,5.2403,8.8378,7.6417,3.7811,2.8779,11.5285,4.8428,3.6272,2.4016,4.1133,5.4559,5.8474,4.6095,3.5778,1.1331,5.1328,2.4962,1.7437,0.7602,6.191,3.3025,1.1151,6.015,1.0419,7.1679,1.8436,0.4099,6.1609,7.1023,8.3877,0.0186,0.0011,0.7347,4.8719,1.5016,6.1265,3.2906,0.3295,3.0972,5.6322,3.1917,5.6818,1.3328,1.0368,5.3219,6.7686,0.4934,2.4005,7.1812,0.3812,6.1072,3.2598,8.0524,2.9991,5.8129,2.773,2.4742,5.9879,3.4753,1.043,0.9545,0.1046,1.2836,4.8201,5.4422,3.8557,0.3392,5.1701,2.76,0.2548,1.9923,2.5113,6.6274,2.5484,1.7663,6.943,3.3961,5.6923,5.0465,1.7893,5.7787,0.7743,1.9518,2.4846,1.8966,4.3963,4.5907,1.27,1.5088,7.6961,1.7326,1.6735,5.8369,1.4205,3.7273,1.2061,1.098,5.5252,1.0159,1.1328,5.4827,0.9754,3.469,2.6826,3.4481,6.1371,2.6153,0.0901,0.1232,12.0537,1.8932,0.642,8.8968,0.6334,3.0251,2.8979,4.974,4.325,7.2976,9.1289,0.1479,4.4591,1.5828,4.6808,2.8293,3.0399,2.2363,2.5749,0.5846,0.7435,5.5847,1.4051,0.8324,4.5307,1.6147,3.2251,6.6786,2.9114,1.0004,3.6475,5.0609,1.714,1.3579,1.6692,2.5598,4.5724,5.1625,1.6381,4.7828,3.2753,4.3823,0.389,4.2787,4.6505,0.9785,7.0345,4.4005,1.545,0.3233,0.0158,1.2105,4.4496,3.0989,0.0165,0.1841,2.9745,2.8627,1.6586,4.8569,0.0059,3.737,0.2902,4.7146,2.7865,1.5014,2.6126,3.2199,1.2019,5.4112,1.8137,0.2921,0.8698,0.0835,2.3917,1.8223,4.6717,1.0308,0.321,4.5325,2.279,1.9115,3.8919,2.0176,3.3995,3.0698,7.1622,6.8333,0.6632,1.05,6.7188,2.8948,0.3621,2.9807,1.6126,5.8032,3.2168,1.884,5.409,0.1542,2.5045,3.93,4.5026,0.0161,1.4626,3.309,4.5898,0.693,3.0031,0.4192,3.917,2.2813,2.8288,7.316,3.8598,2.406,0.0272,0.052,0.7541,3.9265,0.0019,4.2794,5.4864,3.2946,0.8997,0.5566,5.626,1.3595,1.9538,3.84,3.3955,1.8456,4.4439,3.0483,3.3828,1.571,1.2425,1.6088,0.6177,5.1986,0.8706,4.8175,8.8661,0.924,1.399,0.7095,5.3334,7.07,2.4231,4.7532,1.8556,0.1111,2.1823,5.7168,1.5472,2.8794,2.6124,0.417,3.9315,0.9446,2.5493,1.8242,1.0855,4.3831,1.4667,2.0841,2.4374,1.841,1.9189,4.3911,0.4677,1.3534,1.4876,3.7961,7.5076,3.6038,1.657,0.4732,0.1461,1.6093,0.9954,3.3197,0.3997,2.9,1.3095,4.6829,1.0924,0.9891,5.6138,5.7357,2.6806,5.0889,0.2576,1.853,0.3065,2.3953,0.906,5.3023,4.4241,6.7609,0.1157,2.9036,0.8908,3.9832,0.6582,2.4451,5.2548,1.9181,4.1704,1.321,1.3244,5.8976,2.1323,0.3396,0.8023,5.4389,2.8712,2.8316,0.6836,1.574,1.5679,3.2125,0.2643,1.1606,5.0994,2.9883,0.4619,0.1404,4.2932,3.7358,5.8947,2.3597,6.5177,1.2949,4.1627,8.0801,0.6001,6.5451,2.6933,1.0383,5.6451,1.9407,0.8322,1.9628,1.5146,2.2463,3.8727,1.9823,0.1638,0.0728,6.3268,2.7483,0.2657,0.3954,0.5987,5.486,1.1199,0.5692,0.395,4.8389,2.7368,1.274,5.0632,2.4039,1.1252,2.0138,2.5568,3.7128,7.0178,4.7575,4.9038,3.523,7.547,0.798,3.0504,1.6722,0.0744,3.8449,1.3514,1.9118,2.3487,2.7497,2.0067,7.6141,2.5218,5.1024,0.2918,3.8845,0.0011,2.5109,4.2624,7.717,1.2023,5.551,0.5087,0.8928,3.0937,1.2024,3.9606,7.7781,1.9985,1.7742,4.2871,2.5983,4.1081,1.8262,1.3425,5.5513,3.8814,6.3673,2.7332,2.7965,0.8269,4.1998,1.4903,0.3476,7.072,1.676,7.5409,0.7094,2.9918,4.9048,0.1373,1.8727,0.6154,1.2503,0.943,1.1435,1.0967,3.4867,1.6631,3.8819,3.8627,1.5924,3.4952,5.3791,7.5885,7.769,2.2161,2.6564,0.3287,0.3028,1.5362,6.1839,0.779,4.1828,2.314,4.3002,4.9373,1.1365,8.7938,0.0288,1.1229,4.1853,2.3793,0.5796,0.5045,3.2151,2.4293,3.8913,0.2394,2.7863,1.9625,0.0659,3.4709]}

{"prompt":"You just shot your friend instead of the robot duplicate . Now what ?","text":"You just shot your friend instead of the robot duplicate. Now what?\u201d said Sonny\n\u201cYou were asking me to do the same! It didn\u2019t matter where. It doesn\u2019t matter what. It doesn\u2019t matter what we did. I had the ability and that is the point! It\u2019s all about how we are using it. We can do it for good or evil.\u201d\nIt made a beeping noise. Some kind of a signal. It was sending through the air. \u201cThat was the sign.\u201d said Sonny\nThe room shook. The robot was slowly getting out of control. It was not moving quickly which is what Sonny had aimed for. The robot had to use its own legs to move from one end to the other, which the robot was lacking in. It started slamming against the wall causing the window to shatter from the impact.\nSonny got on another robot and started to use his force field on the robot in the main room. He tried to stop it from going out the front of the building. It didn\u2019t do too much damage to the robot but he was able to slow it down enough. That was all he needed. Now it was on its own.\nSonny went back to the control panel to see what was going on. He was happy with the outcome. The robot in the main room had stopped moving which was a good thing. Once they found him, they wouldn\u2019t care how he looked.\nSonny was still standing on the ground and the robot did not seem to know that he was there. His aim to shoot the robot made him think he was going to be able to shoot him. It gave him one more chance to shoot it.\nHe fired. A large explosion. The robot made a screeching sound and then began to shred down into pieces. There was a loud cracking sound as the robot and its pieces were shredded into tiny bits. He was ready for them. He was on his own now. His only problem in trying to stop the robot was the explosion.\nEverything around him exploded. He was in the air as his body hit the ground. He did not feel a thing. He wanted to get out of there. He sat on his own robot and looked out at the scene outside. His body was now covered in pieces.","token_len":485,"entropy":[5.6202,7.8899,3.544,3.9082,7.9275,0.3178,3.6239,7.055,12.2843,1.4289,4.793,3.294,1.3525,10.1853,9.0749,8.4897,10.8218,3.4989,10.1227,4.5449,4.6624,4.0692,6.45,1.5239,0.9502,2.6773,3.2423,1.5926,5.3891,4.0003,4.4278,10.7984,8.623,1.0981,1.7441,4.3271,4.7528,2.583,5.1155,0.7666,0.535,0.0116,0.1359,1.733,2.6972,2.2815,2.5497,0.0676,0.0355,0.01,0.1065,0.9109,4.6491,2.0113,1.1486,2.4853,4.4167,3.0683,4.501,4.1534,4.7248,3.6931,3.4992,4.6058,3.1465,2.8919,1.21,0.1717,2.0724,2.989,2.2943,4.3295,2.0109,2.961,6.0167,2.3134,1.1805,3.1589,3.2602,2.6096,1.4355,3.7747,5.7531,1.4985,2.179,1.0011,1.6303,2.2726,1.3208,4.9058,5.4563,3.0073,6.3921,3.8362,1.3747,1.4482,6.9765,3.5191,0.0332,4.2754,5.7146,1.7353,1.9191,1.5481,6.0544,6.9016,1.0373,2.8749,1.4204,5.1331,3.09,4.1286,1.3551,2.2994,5.9109,1.2163,1.6038,0.9141,2.4787,0.4752,0.2382,2.8114,6.8594,3.3253,0.8287,1.9797,3.8184,1.8972,5.5615,3.9617,4.2184,0.144,1.3644,0.2986,1.8334,1.1176,4.0161,2.4441,5.9724,8.7729,3.5325,2.762,5.9876,3.0602,8.5329,0.6635,0.2316,1.9713,2.0189,2.8893,3.6312,4.6041,0.8914,3.0097,4.5028,0.8195,1.5267,5.1223,1.3153,3.4252,1.3539,0.133,0.0109,2.5839,3.34,5.0987,1.1475,1.8666,8.0224,2.4138,1.4481,1.708,5.017,7.8273,2.1476,0.4512,0.4667,5.8468,1.2838,7.0789,0.357,2.2692,5.3131,0.457,1.2544,0.3617,1.4678,5.4462,0.004,5.2823,4.2456,6.963,4.6839,1.0414,2.0856,2.2067,3.9236,1.1902,6.7913,2.8255,3.9228,0.7342,2.0651,4.2909,1.8731,7.1194,0.6818,0.3661,2.0607,3.5053,0.2666,3.6646,0.6089,2.1164,3.4558,3.9839,3.966,3.1662,3.1418,0.1482,2.5543,1.207,1.9593,3.1001,0.5244,1.0571,0.0012,3.5115,5.1117,0.5761,1.4831,2.2008,0.6593,2.2151,2.5847,3.4864,1.5826,3.9726,0.0036,5.4322,0.287,0.0845,1.5529,3.1184,4.8199,0.6377,1.88,1.6567,1.5033,1.2462,5.5543,2.1853,0.4096,5.5795,0.9485,0.6611,0.4721,0.8158,3.1697,0.003,4.3341,1.4946,0.4248,1.0241,5.3572,1.3961,2.9036,2.8363,1.5228,0.7509,0.7384,0.0451,0.1714,1.6198,2.3386,5.6034,2.1422,1.0058,3.5518,0.5571,1.629,0.9273,4.7718,0.3867,0.9239,0.0285,2.1332,2.8465,0.8817,6.191,0.8249,2.3718,1.6427,0.7098,0.5605,6.2475,3.9645,4.8363,5.0607,1.1392,1.1525,5.8061,0.1443,1.2543,0.0206,3.9108,4.1233,1.5677,2.2754,0.9324,1.7836,2.8909,0.0027,2.7079,3.6752,4.2553,2.2362,0.4163,2.8874,2.6518,2.7832,1.5064,5.1168,0.2809,3.0675,0.2719,4.2776,3.5811,1.0841,0.2301,1.5657,0.2602,4.4492,6.4719,5.0927,3.7576,1.2287,0.5405,5.1771,1.0775,2.3967,2.6995,0.4523,1.8216,0.2069,2.5605,2.2722,0.0032,2.4909,3.9883,1.1527,2.7187,5.2855,0.3121,5.6526,1.3455,1.0489,0.8128,2.1623,1.8356,0.9898,1.0613,2.5261,4.2642,2.729,4.0024,4.4831,2.7669,2.5636,1.4101,0.7452,4.8881,0.5589,4.2195,0.5934,1.1539,1.7849,2.7594,3.7294,0.6149,8.0554,4.0675,2.7237,2.2277,0.2199,4.4429,0.4928,0.867,2.5383,4.6866,0.3686,1.9655,0.9251,1.1187,5.4784,2.0303,4.9458,2.0632,3.6647,2.1683,3.9289,3.7046,0.1729,3.7966,2.1543,5.447,2.0641,4.4948,2.2913,1.7806,2.295,5.0371,0.4679,0.8493,2.7961,0.1914,4.4882,3.8256,3.7091,6.4292,4.7093,0.0497,2.4296,0.9464,0.6683,0.3629,2.2476,5.506,0.5389,0.8598,7.696,4.3785,0.2098,4.353,0.7928,2.2453,1.4835,3.3516,1.8048,2.4313,3.2723,3.6074,1.2374,3.7953,0.1373,0.355,0.5662,1.4935,4.8977,0.0622,2.6836,3.8132,1.3015,0.8762,0.9392,4.9803,0.1286,3.1341,1.3718,0.5003,1.1118,0.8289,0.987,6.479,1.3788,1.9522,3.8728,8.6352,1.1071,3.1192,2.9115,1.9872,0.1217,4.9259,4.3757,0.8223,3.9986,2.8654,0.6975,4.9977,2.3645,0.3074,4.3382,0.7365]}
{"prompt":"You have been thrown into an alternate universe . Everything is the exact same besides one very small thing . It drives you mad .","text":"You have been thrown into an alternate universe. Everything is the exact same besides one very small thing. It drives you mad. It\u2019s called the Unreal Engine. A revolutionary new game engine that allows you to create whatever you want. So start playing with this engine and the Unreal Engine toolkit. Go on. Have fun in this crazy virtual universe. But be aware that there is a chance of losing a lot of data and a lot of your favorite games may not even run correctly.\nThis year I thought to myself that i\u2019m going to try an entirely different game engine called Unity. It is the engine that is used to build the game titles for the Microsoft console X-Box one, one and one X-Box 360. As you can see I\u2019ve not tried it yet. I\u2019m planning on going more into detail as I learn about the game engine itself.\nOne last thing that I want to mention about game engines is the fact that I find that a lot of developers try to make the games look like they are 3D when there is no real 3D in the game whatsoever. I know that this may come off as really stupid, but it\u2019s quite a common problem that occurs in the games. So if you are a game designer or a game developer maybe you will learn something from this video, or perhaps if you know of someone that doesn\u2019t know about game engines you can share this video with them.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it yet you should definitely check out the game maker tutorial that I\u2019ve put up here a while ago. A lot of people have complained to me on social media that they can\u2019t find tutorials to use this amazing toolkit. I have a video tutorial as well that\u2019s for everyone as well so why not read it and get more inspiration to make these awesome projects.\nHello my name is Chris and I work for a game developer called I Am Sasha. I am a game designer. You probably also know me from other places on the internet such as I Am Sasha.com, Gamerz I Am Sasha video series, and other YouTube and YouTube Channels. I\u2019m very excited to be here today because I have a lot of news to share with you guys right now about what\u2019s new in I Am Sasha in the month of October.","token_len":485,"entropy":[3.7506,3.1059,8.1289,1.2751,3.2435,5.4009,1.2232,2.1906,5.8206,1.3257,3.8393,4.5486,0.1917,10.9962,5.971,5.4653,4.3998,3.3233,0.9939,2.6374,9.004,1.2515,1.5307,0.903,1.8667,14.7688,9.013,2.055,6.4773,2.4012,9.4068,0.6663,0.9289,4.9378,8.2599,2.4683,3.139,0.2379,1.5787,3.2033,0.7218,0.0446,1.241,5.8902,0.5391,0.1691,1.3505,5.485,7.1917,2.0348,3.3327,3.4028,3.6683,1.3829,4.9591,3.9042,0.2454,9.055,1.0427,1.1452,5.237,3.4853,2.7063,5.3133,0.0666,6.2246,1.7032,3.9697,6.7365,3.2546,0.6054,5.1749,3.2227,2.285,0.8682,2.8986,1.6106,1.3218,4.4624,2.8468,3.9215,3.5738,1.7494,0.1702,4.7716,2.411,4.7063,0.2361,0.0239,3.2003,4.7903,2.5502,4.5164,1.0326,3.8664,3.5822,4.6895,0.4276,2.2866,7.3594,7.2468,2.8781,5.4201,4.5647,0.3104,2.1776,7.0337,7.022,1.1126,2.6063,1.036,0.0564,2.759,5.378,3.3009,1.6988,1.2773,0.4436,3.9826,4.2534,0.5716,2.317,1.6113,3.0772,3.736,0.7249,2.587,3.3215,1.1164,2.6557,2.3262,2.488,7.9934,3.3916,1.7488,5.8614,4.8029,8.3346,5.0477,1.2926,4.8703,3.1412,4.4096,3.1658,1.6067,6.5358,0.9524,0.3859,1.8105,0.8012,4.7757,1.3685,0.8507,0.2932,3.0589,3.5527,0.0916,2.6039,4.257,3.1111,1.3203,1.8386,0.5746,1.5685,1.7949,0.0632,1.1869,5.0452,1.1422,3.9764,4.7152,2.6745,2.4567,4.2119,1.5201,3.433,3.093,1.7293,2.4515,0.5134,5.4726,0.4373,1.362,4.666,3.514,0.6088,2.9186,1.1864,1.6745,0.0935,1.6575,1.6599,5.3558,0.486,0.6399,2.6438,1.0442,0.0129,3.2291,6.1646,1.6012,3.9523,0.287,0.0282,2.9007,3.9587,0.1933,2.1089,2.7928,2.8282,3.6333,1.2982,1.035,0.5329,6.5234,0.1496,5.5751,5.043,0.6567,0.9398,2.2102,1.6086,0.0861,3.3109,0.8492,0.5944,5.2072,0.1081,2.1019,3.7874,1.243,2.6403,3.1378,5.0336,3.2375,0.2888,6.9125,3.6537,1.1646,0.1013,1.991,4.0593,0.1846,0.0208,4.8971,2.1049,2.03,3.0971,2.7667,5.1622,2.1159,2.0471,2.1412,3.4758,4.1441,2.919,0.2201,1.9367,1.9924,2.1845,2.0896,2.6188,1.3021,2.1603,1.3364,7.1326,0.4997,2.8389,4.5093,1.1812,2.2701,1.1605,5.6426,3.0857,2.5815,3.5356,3.9494,0.1312,4.4393,2.9344,2.7112,1.9519,5.1825,0.6165,0.2381,0.0503,1.6996,1.5231,1.9454,0.1703,3.1155,1.7216,2.7533,2.1102,1.2187,0.8265,0.1609,0.7407,1.1539,3.3143,0.154,5.5353,0.5244,0.0623,0.0353,2.6118,1.9219,0.9665,2.359,2.2811,3.7012,0.9408,0.9875,1.3896,3.8891,5.8886,4.475,3.1529,1.0787,4.9038,0.0524,1.0624,2.0355,2.6,2.0899,6.1602,1.8508,1.2426,0.3424,5.224,1.3924,0.0354,1.3964,2.1656,4.0308,3.7426,0.1197,4.1276,2.9097,0.1167,0.9053,1.5607,3.4037,3.8884,0.0633,0.0039,2.5879,5.7465,3.2999,3.4954,4.9879,4.3759,2.9324,1.0947,0.9123,1.7194,2.0811,3.5578,4.7187,1.3421,6.0063,0.1917,2.3403,8.6545,0.0173,0.1137,4.2882,4.8135,5.4709,0.3121,4.0228,5.8106,0.8011,5.6253,0.5488,2.177,3.125,4.7439,5.2912,3.3289,2.4383,4.4363,2.3949,5.5675,1.1809,0.6814,7.3667,5.1701,0.1141,0.1072,4.298,1.9476,0.3089,4.4182,1.8289,2.0934,1.4096,1.8016,2.8382,4.9965,4.1055,11.7888,0.541,0.7871,1.1584,1.1403,2.3794,1.1301,3.7944,4.462,4.0658,5.0272,0.1625,0.4408,1.0689,3.9752,5.572,3.3597,0.8799,0.9476,3.0861,0.0035,4.7745,1.7972,2.6421,1.6224,6.1261,2.0499,6.7615,4.1847,7.7878,0.6939,0.3743,8.1538,2.8229,0.9832,1.5747,3.3879,4.5117,3.7304,2.7989,8.266,0.0865,0.3808,1.0634,3.0841,0.0602,0.7547,3.8205,2.5516,0.7024,2.2482,3.847,3.2098,4.0126,0.7558,1.966,2.3557,2.2303,0.1948,4.7101,1.4399,0.1683,1.5626,0.0587,2.7439,4.46,0.0877,4.7064,2.4882,9.8122,0.0983,0.8797,3.6878,1.2582,2.655,0.1489,0.0019,5.8468,1.3048,6.8048,0.1496,2.3701,0.4581]}
{"prompt":"When a parent dies , their knowledge and skills immediately pass on to their eldest child . An adoptee is shocked at what they discover when they receive their inheritance without warning .","text":"When a parent dies, their knowledge and skills immediately pass on to their eldest child. An adoptee is shocked at what they discover when they receive their inheritance without warning. Adoptive parents must do their own research and learn how to look after their family members. They must do this at an early age in order to ensure that they pass on some of their parents\u2019 experiences and skills to their children.\nAdoptive parents must remember that they are adopted parents, not biological parents. They must respect their children and try to bring them up in the way they have always wanted. In some cases, a parent must make huge sacrifices in order to find a child who fits the idealized picture of their own childhood.\nMost children grow up to have a happy marriage which has no issue with their mother being an only child. These children are able to respect their mothers for all that she has done for them. These children are happier to marry and have children and they can build up meaningful family attachments. On the other hand, some children may feel that they have no father and do not have a source of emotional support. They can develop an identity as a child of divorce. They may experience rejection after the death of their father or experience guilt as they feel that the father chose to leave the family. They may feel that their mother suffered the same loss because he also left the family. These children may have many unresolved issues when they grow up.\nA lack of emotional support may cause a child to develop the belief that they are bad for not being able to have any children. They may have to struggle with low self-esteem for a long time until they eventually realize that they are not bad. Most of these children are more successful than their peers, however, this advantage comes at the cost of their children.\nMany adoptive parents have to decide whether they should have children of their own, and adopt them at an early age or wait until they get out of their children\u2019s lives. Some adoptive parents decide to have children of their own because they enjoy parenthood and would like their own children. In order for such parents to remain emotionally bonded to their children, they must understand the reasons why they chose to adopt. Most parents want the best for their children and feel that they can provide a better environment, even if it means not being able to meet all of the child\u2019s needs.","token_len":485,"entropy":[3.591,6.2961,4.9431,0.6684,3.0436,7.3892,2.5691,2.7044,7.2091,5.5875,3.1315,0.3083,0.7495,8.4279,0.8937,0.5233,5.8718,9.1643,0.1133,0.0007,2.8155,9.4824,2.4979,2.5945,1.6968,3.8531,2.2094,0.7914,5.329,2.187,5.8963,6.6017,5.9075,0.4584,6.0609,1.2371,0.9979,0.5217,3.9341,4.9671,1.5205,3.8553,0.7112,1.5125,2.7371,1.9973,0.2439,5.4282,0.2497,0.2486,4.4416,1.8765,1.0255,2.7554,1.4102,4.187,1.2328,4.3394,3.2521,0.1782,0.0112,3.2908,0.0988,0.1039,2.312,0.7967,1.6849,6.1033,0.3062,5.5504,0.3977,0.4049,5.8807,17.2406,7.7662,8.4383,2.0309,2.4649,1.0446,0.2243,0.979,0.4526,1.1402,12.8146,0.4244,0.0659,0.7698,1.7463,5.0091,0.6538,1.8787,0.9314,5.7338,5.1933,1.9505,1.9539,5.0938,0.6109,0.4127,1.3473,0.9695,4.1315,1.0363,2.3034,1.4198,6.141,0.1732,4.7599,0.6263,2.8675,2.5089,1.7779,3.972,0.7665,3.9214,2.5282,1.5593,1.5994,4.1948,3.4353,0.8389,0.3049,3.5329,1.8134,4.0329,4.3944,8.7849,0.3709,2.0158,0.2284,0.058,5.0957,1.1573,2.6148,1.826,4.5633,1.929,3.5541,4.8545,3.382,0.202,2.1528,2.7999,4.5969,0.2788,1.5864,5.401,3.8839,3.5353,0.1154,2.1957,3.0801,1.5848,4.587,6.4923,5.9383,3.3617,4.8061,5.5953,0.4319,2.0237,3.8309,3.993,3.1292,7.2521,0.0325,0.4128,4.6431,1.0338,1.289,4.1015,0.0154,6.5473,0.4176,2.7142,3.6337,3.9416,2.0762,3.8737,0.5362,0.4508,0.7179,0.0271,0.649,3.7417,0.3289,1.1556,7.1648,5.1056,6.6424,1.6223,1.513,0.7347,3.5815,3.7952,3.1051,6.4109,2.5045,8.1687,3.9285,6.4953,0.9476,7.1288,0.3984,0.1588,0.0422,0.0339,2.464,1.4333,2.2099,3.0236,1.5837,1.1232,1.601,1.9886,5.2311,1.939,3.7037,0.0255,1.4022,1.1794,8.0574,0.0623,4.9393,0.5071,0.8494,2.1279,3.8529,4.7418,3.0407,5.0226,3.1851,0.9976,2.9666,4.7391,8.1361,2.2965,2.3926,0.9138,4.2858,4.9502,5.0528,3.0821,3.7529,0.054,0.4114,1.6739,1.8519,7.1376,4.1774,3.889,1.2612,3.0905,1.1796,2.9922,3.0247,6.7424,0.7197,2.189,2.435,0.5439,0.6046,2.0449,0.4731,1.6265,0.8302,1.2841,2.0244,6.3947,4.3919,1.3301,3.7702,4.6596,4.2734,6.9771,2.0302,1.5736,0.0608,0.4158,2.7937,0.6217,1.4096,2.3735,4.9171,4.1561,1.0799,4.8578,0.5666,2.3033,0.0246,0.4694,1.0625,3.3574,6.5933,0.0035,4.1804,0.3343,2.8197,2.184,1.7994,0.3494,0.0692,2.3904,4.3924,3.88,0.0422,1.7381,0.9397,6.3104,3.7813,5.2647,1.4058,1.3335,0.0022,2.5084,4.6174,1.4788,0.3794,2.014,0.3252,2.6364,3.0953,4.9013,1.0365,7.8941,0.1442,0.3511,0.0179,4.9232,2.5281,1.3893,0.2285,3.5608,0.2757,4.6737,2.6807,0.2026,0.6346,0.5515,1.4273,3.0184,2.2486,5.5231,1.7297,1.1714,0.5178,1.8943,5.5281,4.7013,1.7126,1.0612,3.2242,2.8256,4.6171,0.5358,4.1604,8.5875,4.3733,0.4762,1.4132,0.4293,0.0067,2.0631,3.8515,2.9201,1.1961,3.3588,2.0267,0.1593,2.6786,3.149,4.5937,1.6717,1.8366,4.0133,2.951,0.965,3.524,0.1362,0.1446,2.6667,2.6131,5.7924,1.0018,3.229,2.355,0.0389,0.0159,3.4441,4.5157,0.3112,0.6889,4.1048,4.9268,0.2231,2.4446,6.0718,4.2205,0.2588,5.3268,2.2259,0.5495,2.9431,2.1061,0.083,3.0782,0.7298,2.0677,0.9529,1.3883,0.0272,0.0154,2.63,0.5285,5.5275,9.1021,0.0045,1.0987,5.1633,0.767,3.3629,3.6525,0.3521,1.9843,4.0473,3.4003,2.3292,3.9582,1.6474,0.0335,5.3891,6.7361,7.0987,1.1851,0.0673,0.2798,0.2153,0.4438,0.3564,3.9617,2.1453,4.6678,0.9373,0.7435,2.4912,0.4113,1.712,2.02,4.345,2.6117,4.2594,3.6447,3.3021,0.2164,0.0415,0.2065,1.5737,4.6417,0.7534,0.8451,2.6434,2.9576,2.8017,3.2088,4.2551,4.4799,4.0523,0.4306,1.8896,0.7969,4.0201,2.3456,0.2771,0.0019,4.326,3.9782,1.0766,1.7649,3.0667,8.0394,0.0505,0.1171,0.1444,0.2703]}

You have no idea how you came into all this wealth, until you suddenly spot a small detail in the video... Your future Self says that, by the grace of God, you lost a huge amount of money in a financial scam.\nThis is one of the many questions I get asked here at LW. I tend to recommend that you focus on what you can control in this scenario and use the rest of us as a sparring partner to learn more about who and what your future self is.\nI have a friend who is an investment expert (I really don't know what you call this). When you mention your friend to me I will advise you to put him in the conversation.\nAs for the future self, I found the same way of looking at it. I read once that one of the great secrets of success is that you stop worrying about your future (including the future self's self in a scenario like this) and actually live your present. If you have a big future plan, you have to have a smaller present vision. I have that mentality anyway. Some say to forget about everything but the here and now. I think that it is hard when you have such a big self image. But maybe there are reasons why you had to be there.\nI think that what you are describing is a common fear that people have with money. We all worry about how to manage our own money and what to do with our lives. How can I spend less money and get the same stuff that I need?\nI also know a guy, in my 30s, who is very, very focused on money, he knows how to invest and earn money. He is also happy, financially and emotionally.\nIn this case, i think your friend is very smart. And you don't find it easy to accept that the other person is smart.\nMaybe you really don't know what you like in his company. And that is why he is not in your friend list.\nI think your friend will understand your situation just fine. And after you have taken some time to look back, you will see that it was a really exciting time for you. Maybe even a little like a fairytale (like the last part of the book \"The Golden Compass\").","token_len":486,"entropy":[3.8828,8.4104,1.0957,5.043,3.4336,0.8338,4.8515,3.4909,4.7997,7.4909,8.7966,1.5283,4.9117,1.2155,1.2457,1.8463,1.5138,1.1948,6.54,0.9429,11.8842,5.276,5.0088,11.7488,9.6484,2.4855,1.6536,3.1518,2.9852,0.6171,1.1465,3.3255,3.8982,3.3334,6.2166,0.4316,5.0518,1.4309,5.4409,0.3734,5.8325,6.4337,1.1966,4.2055,5.8873,1.7685,1.2317,2.2998,5.2325,5.4999,4.7682,5.2598,5.2267,2.6784,4.2169,5.4059,1.3166,3.8528,0.0386,0.0845,0.1781,0.7973,7.4908,3.3998,3.935,0.3972,0.0737,0.7187,2.3531,2.5675,5.2717,2.3833,0.7336,2.9313,5.9534,1.0196,3.9287,0.2846,0.5444,3.6375,5.7151,2.0162,2.2696,0.4013,5.4449,2.5235,9.8709,1.98,1.8749,6.2582,0.0276,7.0413,2.0808,0.7181,5.9574,0.2197,2.7852,0.8306,2.5919,2.8108,3.1339,2.6115,4.056,2.6167,5.0528,2.1508,5.9348,0.142,9.0044,1.2898,1.9055,10.3985,0.0133,0.1714,1.5431,3.9391,2.6038,0.3045,4.711,3.397,0.2794,3.0683,0.868,1.7329,0.3506,0.6375,1.1033,2.7177,2.9496,2.2209,2.8415,0.4364,1.6455,3.2386,4.9784,6.0061,4.5647,2.5097,5.6418,2.2452,0.0008,1.1955,1.417,4.1622,2.8865,2.1864,4.3665,4.2708,2.6804,6.3028,2.6027,5.9994,2.8025,4.5209,3.6355,3.4002,6.6857,0.3647,0.3185,4.2507,2.6049,1.5512,1.812,5.3096,1.8662,2.4722,4.4519,2.6288,1.6256,2.8347,1.5998,0.3993,1.6127,5.8067,2.977,4.1512,5.8886,3.1189,3.0926,0.4837,2.9991,1.4418,1.5746,5.6369,7.4764,0.8304,4.4159,0.4459,0.3366,3.6742,4.9146,0.568,4.8924,0.332,1.4127,1.1082,7.2237,2.8513,0.1713,2.2031,0.3372,6.4086,6.4671,2.0752,0.9944,0.4705,3.0975,4.7558,5.5163,3.3873,7.2663,1.3055,0.1362,1.3698,0.4203,5.169,5.0793,2.4424,6.0216,4.2154,3.3639,0.3156,2.8393,1.3616,4.5919,2.1497,5.4693,1.3936,0.9,3.0318,0.8883,3.7176,1.2379,5.8046,3.5817,7.8645,0.8729,3.1378,2.4996,6.6136,6.9667,8.1924,0.5864,7.0506,5.6157,4.0576,7.0186,0.6871,4.4466,3.5812,1.9678,10.0578,0.1429,0.0205,0.701,2.2432,2.188,1.5108,3.9959,0.7226,5.3877,5.1998,0.3673,1.6885,3.5238,0.6452,1.4534,5.9708,5.5739,1.1454,3.8522,5.2182,3.8798,1.5815,5.9194,1.6442,0.9385,6.0102,1.5919,2.7347,4.4591,1.8623,0.9546,2.0507,2.3562,1.019,3.797,1.394,1.9192,4.6323,0.8847,1.7653,5.2049,4.6789,1.727,3.2076,0.7729,3.9552,4.0255,0.6756,4.2326,1.4373,5.4955,0.232,2.5304,2.7226,4.209,0.7022,3.3503,0.664,2.1781,2.8592,1.507,0.3548,0.8633,2.9438,3.1859,0.3655,4.667,2.5188,4.478,4.795,4.9316,0.8291,2.2325,3.5696,3.1884,1.9675,5.5491,2.4904,0.4582,3.0628,1.0425,2.2578,1.7243,3.7469,3.4488,3.1612,2.661,4.8165,4.4857,2.044,3.9006,0.3966,0.3212,0.1084,2.1475,2.7201,4.8411,0.0105,5.1932,0.3546,2.889,3.0307,4.2754,5.0034,1.4156,0.1533,4.3986,1.8816,6.9412,1.1786,0.6048,0.9382,2.1018,2.9769,6.9329,3.9701,6.284,1.9783,1.6593,0.3872,2.5052,3.5551,2.0912,2.0772,0.653,7.5697,1.968,4.9749,4.1925,1.3646,3.387,3.8178,1.1395,4.5186,3.5298,3.9509,0.0012,6.3056,2.0279,3.1864,0.3435,5.6879,1.391,3.6527,5.3959,0.5542,1.1285,3.4414,0.6946,1.6394,5.4395,1.1223,5.1217,2.2343,0.0007,1.8368,1.1159,1.0133,5.8413,3.4061,6.118,5.5856,0.968,3.9649,3.2299,1.3776,2.1794,2.2271,1.5122,3.0979,4.1352,1.7097,8.2562,4.6349,0.3577,1.1697,2.1354,1.6824,3.1377,0.8127,3.4245,3.8005,3.6516,3.0089,6.1459,1.5602,0.4467,2.5181,5.8277,1.533,1.6853,4.8052,2.6084,0.4376,0.4222,3.7419,6.2287,1.8204,0.8327,0.5434,1.7046,0.6608,3.0948,1.8065,1.6915,3.9312,5.7234,0.6547,1.1998,0.7162,0.5252,4.9271,4.1914,1.3166,3.5649,6.5013,1.7155,8.8685,0.2326,0.0006,5.8181,3.9157,2.2374,5.2068,5.257,0.3953,1.0463,1.8193,4.0295,1.7848,4.1962,4.133,0.7424]}

A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming : `` You're a scientist, Henry ''. The man says no magic can hurt you. So, you take him to your home. Soon you find other people like this, in an organization called the Council. But all the others are killed. Henry is one of the few survivors. He is ordered to follow the Council and lead them to the source of the magic. You soon discover that the Council is a group of murderers who live in fear of any who are left alive. And their goal is to destroy magic before the arrival of a new powerful one named Melora. But at what cost?'' - A few hours later :'' So far the game is just OK. But once you get past the first level there is a big disappointment : nothing happened! The game is just plain dead!'' I had just finished reading a book about a young wizard. I had just begun a huge, long history book. I was reading the last page of the book when it happened :'' A short, sudden blast and that young wizard was dead. I could not believe what just happened.'' Another, even shorter blast and the young man with a large hat appeared and said'' I am Melora, a powerful wizard. This is my companion, Peter and his granddaughter.'' I looked at the young girl. She had just gotten up to leave. I was about to take the'key '. Suddenly the game crashed! I had to wait until there was a restart. A long time later I heard another story :'' The new version of this game ( which was made at a later date for PS3 and PSVita ). The story is about the same young wizard as the last one we saw. The plot is just similar. An old lady appeared and told me that Melora had been killed some time ago. She also suggested that there would be a new game. I saw the game and I bought it without thinking about the ending.'' My first real review about Destiny ( I wrote a few years ago on Gamesfly : How to be a good gamer ). This story did not happen in the game, but in real life ( because of the first review I wrote about Destiny ).\nI have not much to add.

The question and answer part should provide you with a chance to include facts which could be used as possible support for the entire thesis you intend to write. The introduction can also take up a lot of words, but if your focus of your essay is to tell your readers something, then write your introduction carefully. If you are not allowed to include the introduction of your essay within 800 to 1000 words, then you should always make sure that you include a few paragraphs of introduction within a certain word limit.","token_len":487,"entropy":[6.0077,4.9264,8.491,5.2378,9.655,1.2845,0.4406,4.4311,4.1011,7.1986,3.0396,0.973,2.077,1.0387,1.5286,3.4903,4.0665,2.1443,3.0727,3.7366,3.7547,4.0457,0.0104,8.7741,0.3272,7.3583,15.0293,4.5732,6.9088,6.8278,3.3464,4.4725,2.7761,6.5081,1.9732,4.5257,3.122,3.4635,5.4951,4.239,1.4378,4.1492,7.4112,5.9104,9.0867,6.4553,3.9201,12.6988,1.6779,4.7696,5.4375,4.4233,2.8171,6.0371,2.0273,5.7249,1.9008,4.4369,2.9278,4.3751,5.14,2.5639,6.9596,6.8468,1.8269,2.5453,3.4744,5.1022,2.3356,5.1574,0.006,4.2698,1.3458,6.2153,0.5889,4.8849,0.5047,2.7324,4.2472,6.0572,2.0275,3.8532,6.2047,0.3855,0.913,3.3802,2.6045,2.8821,0.026,1.1134,5.0964,1.8959,1.46,4.5589,0.1649,3.8627,6.8656,4.367,4.5206,1.4231,1.9128,5.0373,5.5344,0.9633,2.5859,6.2199,0.8817,4.2642,6.0531,3.1079,4.2783,3.7901,1.4697,1.5815,0.6341,3.3046,2.8091,6.2252,2.2295,2.8763,3.7461,1.3687,1.4094,1.8985,4.6066,0.319,1.8846,0.9638,2.9222,2.9858,2.6201,0.6817,1.693,3.3615,2.8737,2.4142,2.5824,2.3752,2.8437,2.8063,2.526,0.5557,6.0429,3.0636,3.6843,0.329,1.3707,0.0316,0.1064,0.3325,4.0735,2.7785,2.2562,1.1711,3.024,5.2375,2.0574,4.6361,0.0532,5.8876,4.1778,1.5852,6.4887,6.5053,0.6038,1.6866,0.7164,5.0052,2.7055,2.8653,2.7327,3.4956,3.0817,1.0348,2.9205,1.7315,5.4381,3.7395,3.9587,1.6683,7.0778,2.3392,1.1471,1.5485,0.7717,2.4945,4.5184,2.5836,3.4055,0.4598,0.0413,0.5851,4.8939,3.9412,2.1324,1.7668,1.7314,4.6351,1.6074,4.8182,2.0452,1.407,1.9453,7.4329,1.0746,7.0109,7.7923,0.6565,3.9621,0.3403,0.5388,4.0534,16.5584,1.7079,5.3384,1.0137,5.541,0.2497,2.3407,0.8292,1.7241,2.9164,2.6956,1.3602,0.6728,1.9612,1.396,2.8519,1.6454,4.4744,0.8942,1.4595,0.6447,2.9141,0.3042,2.3295,4.9469,0.7872,1.7192,0.8851,0.5743,1.3969,3.2908,4.3089,1.4454,3.5683,2.4483,0.1772,0.447,0.0977,0.8382,4.5273,1.1651,5.1321,0.2639,1.2476,1.9875,3.4693,0.1329,1.0357,1.3281,1.7976,6.3465,2.0275,5.2017,4.4665,2.9501,4.1952,1.5665,4.393,3.6962,0.025,0.0288,2.7405,5.5991,0.1206,2.6977,4.8704,0.0148,4.2978,3.8371,2.9814,3.3844,5.2612,3.8605,1.7816,0.2428,2.9603,1.3411,4.0357,0.2302,1.3836,2.1883,3.2765,0.0829,0.4018,0.9104,4.2895,0.0512,1.562,2.8102,1.3599,3.4075,0.394,4.7992,1.8437,1.1106,3.7434,2.8674,3.7156,0.1644,7.7013,3.2683,3.1772,0.7175,0.338,1.6792,3.8893,0.6602,1.5668,4.4236,0.7812,5.2729,0.1779,0.2352,0.5205,5.0006,6.6362,2.2623,4.0138,3.716,1.1438,0.2694,2.7436,1.1009,2.3589,7.1631,1.9917,1.9877,4.0208,2.3104,1.786,4.8415,1.5445,0.3643,2.2039,2.7021,5.6204,1.6351,2.9232,2.1395,1.4353,2.8743,0.2062,1.3164,0.5022,0.733,5.6342,2.1171,1.0946,5.2993,2.6184,4.0534,2.8349,4.6415,1.452,1.5802,0.6588,0.4319,2.451,3.3682,3.8369,3.6977,2.1508,5.7076,3.1885,3.1596,5.3281,4.0922,3.9991,3.3454,1.1286,5.5425,2.9989,0.0459,4.4455,0.3017,2.3076,3.1585,0.7577,0.0208,4.7085,2.8268,6.0302,2.8854,0.1299,1.3269,6.0986,0.0855,7.2904,6.2446,4.909,3.4615,1.1759,2.5595,1.8787,6.6373,5.372,0.6794,1.5848,6.0687,4.7606,4.905,3.9251,0.1123,0.2195,0.3257,2.1656,3.8271,3.1503,1.5867,5.7518,2.3351,3.0242,0.7263,0.0341,5.7491,1.693,2.727,3.2111,3.2748,6.4565,6.1945,2.5253,0.35,0.1853,1.9584,4.0392,2.5197,0.671,2.8251,1.7031,0.8829,5.7143,2.1499,1.9907,5.6333,1.1615,2.7567,0.584,2.0632,2.5122,6.0229,0.1468,2.5349,2.316,5.3273,3.0582,1.46,1.2863,4.8795,13.8075,7.5853,1.2858,0.0341,0.3748,0.4651,1.2703,2.1054,4.3069,3.9539,0.9176,1.1243,1.0574,1.7214,3.0702,3.215,2.4467,1.8597,5.7365,4.2882,3.4992,5.0217,7.1301,3.9843,0.4221]}
{"prompt":"SatChat : Are you working on a book ? Why or why not ?","text":"SatChat : Are you working on a book? Why or why not? How about getting paid? What is your advice to other writers?\nC.V. Sinha : I\u2019m at the point in my career where I find that the people who have the most influence on my career are people who are on the side of writers.\nSo I try not to rely on anybody but on myself. And I try to find creative answers to the questions I ask myself rather than look for someone else to answer them. So, writing has always been important to me. But it has only been recently that it has become important to me financially.\nSo I think that what I will probably advise is to find your niche. It\u2019s not so important to have a massive fan base.\nYou are on the right track. As long as you don\u2019t let anything stop you from putting your work out there.\nC.V. Sinha : Well, it\u2019s not the same. You know, these new platforms have been created so that people can be seen, and that they can promote themselves.\nAnd it has become increasingly expensive. And it\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad thing, I see it as something that, in a sense, allows for everyone to have an outlet.\nC.V. Sinha : Yeah, the way I see it is that writing has to be personal. We\u2019re talking about a writing community.\nAnd even if it\u2019s not necessarily about the art of writing, it\u2019s about being aware of your audience\u2026 You don\u2019t want to write about somebody who doesn\u2019t care about you or isn\u2019t interested.\nI still think that you still have to have an emotional connection to your audience and that you have to be able to convey that.\nC.V. Sinha : It\u2019s hard for me because when it comes to the process of self-publishing, it seems that people have got out of the habit of being responsible and self-regulated. And I am really not, I don\u2019t think so.\nI have a new one coming out in the works. And I\u2019m still working on that. My focus has been on my job, but I guess that\u2019s why you keep asking me to write.","token_len":488,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,6.7429,0.2862,4.8153,0.2605,1.392,6.3965,2.0372,5.9982,4.5666,0.3079,0.0093,0.5408,5.4307,2.4679,5.1787,5.6068,2.3238,3.3768,2.3128,0.7568,7.0291,1.6718,2.8376,3.1,1.0745,0.969,9.903,4.6021,4.6029,0.6142,8.0613,0.2567,0.4599,1.2316,16.9754,8.417,2.3691,5.8038,1.5639,3.2017,3.0099,0.4029,1.2702,0.3609,0.3455,5.8278,2.9303,3.0943,4.2108,1.2068,3.3183,1.9902,1.2045,3.1561,0.7433,1.329,2.3095,0.6628,2.428,0.4285,1.3684,5.1221,1.0876,3.0447,0.0592,4.7837,0.8922,3.0827,5.2629,1.8601,4.7032,2.5804,0.0184,5.404,0.2315,3.8399,2.5109,4.8674,1.0519,0.7446,3.5361,1.267,1.6728,0.4818,3.6961,5.1841,6.4438,0.6567,2.2477,1.1529,1.7207,3.0448,0.3678,6.3941,0.024,7.3068,1.048,3.236,1.0052,1.4243,2.6072,0.9716,0.2048,3.1676,2.4101,5.9039,3.5268,1.4807,0.1458,5.9059,0.7846,0.0382,0.7477,2.451,2.5342,1.6004,4.8912,1.3061,4.1827,0.3036,2.6519,0.6991,0.9392,3.4409,0.6121,0.4462,8.5635,0.6245,1.4953,2.4473,1.326,2.3069,1.3105,4.4168,1.0928,4.8782,4.5923,9.7218,1.9057,1.1194,3.6868,5.0956,4.1401,1.402,3.2934,6.7343,1.1234,1.1262,2.1351,3.7385,3.6615,1.3073,3.9201,1.1426,7.8566,4.0665,0.1172,1.3167,2.2129,3.4788,2.8679,4.986,1.2378,2.163,0.2683,0.9489,5.704,2.7615,0.0066,0.4027,2.8694,1.2006,1.3598,0.0954,4.4298,4.6372,3.1074,0.0625,0.621,5.362,1.328,1.4079,1.8498,0.2452,0.427,0.9458,2.4406,0.0184,0.0063,0.0226,0.0726,0.0002,0.0426,3.6922,0.3332,2.852,1.4087,0.0598,0.0397,1.8353,3.6085,2.1457,2.5455,3.0006,1.9819,0.3926,7.2214,6.176,5.928,2.3967,2.3587,3.6678,3.8289,0.4408,1.5975,0.5493,3.8523,5.5013,2.6948,2.1084,2.7076,3.0808,0.3394,8.8483,2.1184,0.897,2.0784,2.513,2.7975,2.157,2.7031,4.4997,5.6722,1.7488,2.1703,2.2152,2.6033,0.0265,0.0292,2.1826,2.3639,2.6054,2.1301,0.0132,0.1228,2.8406,1.2561,0.3217,1.6791,3.5166,6.0965,1.1617,1.3981,3.4317,0.6608,5.3505,2.7516,2.2718,1.5749,0.0577,4.812,3.0153,6.3462,0.2788,2.372,2.1557,2.9951,1.0563,1.4199,4.1764,0.006,0.0035,0.0012,0.0011,0.0001,0.0073,3.2095,0.5989,3.9567,3.542,1.5019,1.3088,0.0249,0.9355,0.5702,5.4264,1.8183,3.8573,0.5764,7.1649,0.6865,5.0933,3.8056,0.3891,1.1589,1.7276,0.1321,2.8345,5.8583,2.8361,1.6822,2.4004,2.1606,5.5707,0.9348,1.9418,1.9262,0.0182,0.0359,1.0008,4.9537,2.8254,2.2012,5.0154,1.8303,0.6652,0.6726,0.9919,1.0271,0.0127,0.0502,0.6881,3.4773,5.2836,0.251,2.2727,2.8812,7.411,4.8955,3.4089,0.1698,0.0817,0.0028,1.3983,0.4477,3.1971,1.758,5.2472,1.116,2.0424,0.2086,0.0658,0.0337,3.3717,0.5854,1.0885,2.5786,6.1647,0.155,0.0196,0.0031,2.3454,4.1943,0.9331,3.1702,6.4953,1.2793,0.6068,2.9876,6.519,0.6117,1.5956,3.3675,2.3156,5.2412,0.9146,1.248,1.3963,0.4886,2.9822,2.2036,1.5209,1.1636,0.1026,1.5319,1.4737,0.0037,3.7449,1.3064,1.3915,0.9851,1.0613,0.0006,0.0011,0.0004,0.0004,0.0002,0.0034,2.9888,1.5076,0.0179,0.0374,2.7755,2.241,0.1691,4.0559,3.7456,3.56,0.1843,0.0414,2.982,6.0186,0.4522,6.4238,0.1096,0.2667,0.0053,0.4447,1.9195,2.9629,1.867,3.0491,2.7214,4.7376,6.0929,0.3163,1.8951,3.0611,0.0901,3.3981,7.0392,2.2047,3.7346,0.0221,7.1719,0.7484,2.5133,1.5866,4.4161,3.3954,2.5765,4.6508,1.7276,1.8812,0.2863,0.0402,0.0222,1.0125,3.9745,0.4682,0.7787,2.01,3.5102,2.0476,5.5079,5.199,1.1205,0.596,2.7697,1.8659,4.5019,1.0809,2.304,0.9561,4.7638,0.0281,0.2644,4.5162,1.9181,0.2657,2.5472,0.7589,5.4973,4.5047,3.2707,1.2954,0.8695,3.0325,5.8653,1.7706,2.4749,0.6054,5.401,2.0345,2.6218,0.0094,1.0745,3.5887,4.7293,3.7659,2.7085,0.3779,2.8806,2.3356,1.5789]}
{"prompt":"You start blacking out constantly when drinking , every time you come to , you find a paper written by yourself 100 % disproving fundamental theories .","text":"You start blacking out constantly when drinking, every time you come to, you find a paper written by yourself 100 % disproving fundamental theories. Every time you drink your intelligence begins to fade, and every time you drink you are more ignorant than when you started. You are nothing but an alcoholic.\nI am sure as hell not trying to sell you anything. But you seem to be having an argument with yourself over a hypothetical possibility, so here\u2019s my suggestion:\nInstead of wondering whether you might have a disease, I encourage you to worry less about being addicted to alcohol and begin living as if you were.\nDrinking may make you feel less stressed and less insecure, but what about that stress? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s worth spending your free time living instead of drinking?\nIf the people who are actually addicted to alcohol are so miserable, then why do you try to convince others you\u2019re not?\nWhen I\u2019m tired, depressed, scared, angry, sad \u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m depressed, scary, angry, sad \u2026 when I drink, I know I\u2019m depressed, scary, angry, sad, etc.\nMy theory is if I were more aware of these things when I start drinking, I would probably not start drinking.\nThe only reason to drink seems to be to make things worse instead of feel better. Why do you think this works?\nWhy do you think that only when you\u2019re drunk do bad things happen to us? Not when we\u2019re awake or trying to sleep! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s weird?\nPeople may be afraid of dying because of the fear of loss of consciousness, but alcohol is just a drug that can help you relax \u2026 like sleeping pills.\nWhy are all diseases attributed to alcohol by medical doctors and researchers? Are you addicted to alcohol and you have a disease?\nHow much do you use alcohol per day? Let me know in the comment and we\u2019ll discuss it there. I think we\u2019re on the same page.\nI found a nice website, and I asked the author why he thought alcohol is not dangerous, and he replied.\nYou can take a nap without sleeping pills, or eat a piece of candy to feel satisfied. But all of these things are drugs except alcohol.","token_len":488,"entropy":[6.9213,10.5591,1.0098,0.1609,9.3312,4.0534,8.7806,1.9192,7.7216,0.8187,1.3575,4.9017,2.2839,5.3563,1.7783,4.8244,3.2875,8.1121,7.7914,2.4067,4.9594,11.0159,5.768,11.1646,1.938,13.0804,4.8769,1.6565,5.066,0.6262,0.5481,3.3084,4.3364,10.6378,5.2452,0.1178,4.2951,1.9882,1.2244,3.3235,0.1276,0.1875,2.6011,1.5467,3.0821,3.915,6.6651,1.683,4.7985,0.14,2.5212,1.1511,2.6601,1.8849,6.6891,1.0718,1.9858,6.0587,1.215,1.4157,6.7422,2.4171,3.5222,6.3342,1.4585,1.0364,4.8282,0.0718,4.8683,0.3827,3.3436,1.5339,2.8925,2.4134,5.9188,0.298,1.4657,4.2109,2.8861,4.0115,0.9026,2.1608,3.661,3.9585,6.3967,6.8189,2.4135,3.2471,4.2819,17.6973,6.8522,5.6815,2.7793,3.0982,1.479,2.3472,6.4946,0.103,7.1918,3.2393,1.2771,4.4344,2.0357,1.7312,6.2113,0.943,3.5121,5.6736,0.039,0.0552,6.8634,3.1512,0.2385,4.3649,5.8993,0.5454,0.8094,1.0959,7.6155,4.9002,3.8223,1.6314,0.6084,1.4793,1.6392,1.6546,5.7577,0.5636,5.0938,3.5355,0.1902,2.5906,3.3441,3.3768,1.6597,1.4978,6.4675,0.7355,0.6959,4.7623,1.6351,3.9211,5.5958,1.1843,5.3089,8.8929,0.7935,0.388,3.1143,1.3331,1.9846,4.4322,0.1511,1.3351,3.7094,4.1137,1.6203,3.797,0.0284,6.0627,8.5245,0.1104,2.7379,0.6054,0.9771,2.8008,4.4672,5.9082,1.326,1.9225,4.8458,3.2146,0.4091,0.2418,1.0366,4.311,6.0206,1.4549,2.1154,1.5485,1.9346,1.4965,5.364,0.2203,1.7209,5.1168,4.0246,8.5289,0.1358,2.3808,2.0912,2.2476,1.1431,4.2518,1.7817,7.3922,0.062,0.8229,5.3243,2.1919,5.0681,0.3802,4.7551,0.3657,3.0632,0.2979,4.2914,7.5972,1.5626,2.9427,0.2639,0.101,0.0189,2.9731,3.0599,0.7246,1.5407,0.0205,1.6612,6.0366,0.8178,9.562,0.2573,1.5435,0.4307,0.1563,2.202,5.6944,0.2309,6.6786,1.087,0.6382,4.6591,1.1597,1.0232,0.0247,1.9163,2.5861,0.5714,3.9712,0.0289,0.4084,0.1205,0.0294,2.2398,5.1864,0.3278,1.3454,4.6847,4.9765,0.8108,5.2237,1.1875,4.6955,4.85,3.7683,0.2792,4.7761,1.4242,4.6313,0.1349,7.0693,0.5205,0.3806,0.5508,0.7528,3.0398,3.5225,4.0522,0.8059,1.6132,1.098,3.5971,3.0202,2.3795,3.0147,3.0702,5.9785,0.0895,0.1328,1.6113,3.06,4.9986,1.5916,6.1021,0.0452,8.0458,0.2829,0.508,4.8002,2.0367,0.6945,0.8119,2.2158,4.0585,0.4284,0.6178,3.8534,0.996,0.3962,0.2177,1.6101,5.7294,2.92,0.3959,8.7388,0.1591,0.7568,2.3778,1.6056,8.3173,0.0516,0.781,2.1797,5.9367,0.3944,6.6506,2.8014,1.2625,2.1531,0.0426,0.0598,8.1091,3.2654,7.7828,0.0642,3.0992,5.1574,5.9032,0.042,0.025,0.0027,1.1105,0.2796,0.9492,6.3935,0.0106,2.2847,6.9038,0.9105,0.6549,5.2353,5.1715,2.3999,4.4665,0.7799,5.5003,2.0407,1.0543,2.7993,3.3258,0.4554,7.1097,2.0128,3.4712,1.064,0.6362,6.2825,1.6194,3.6334,1.9682,3.7757,1.804,2.6008,4.394,1.2315,3.4584,7.108,4.8323,4.6325,2.843,0.9429,0.7939,3.6943,2.7539,4.7293,8.0005,7.0783,0.0652,1.0103,6.1415,6.0293,2.2761,2.793,3.8892,0.3473,4.773,2.4698,6.7781,0.1496,1.0104,2.8588,2.6929,3.0044,1.769,2.1579,1.3172,0.7202,4.2946,3.3958,2.1979,0.3886,4.3924,1.398,3.5727,0.2517,0.3653,5.8373,0.4966,1.4946,0.8217,0.0614,2.685,5.475,3.8384,2.287,0.1194,0.2468,2.7325,1.546,6.6925,0.5481,3.4063,2.8169,3.257,2.7862,0.0301,2.8892,3.8124,0.5031,2.1565,0.3576,0.9541,0.5288,2.3991,6.2277,2.3423,5.6177,3.7475,3.2019,4.0931,1.6082,5.5299,2.7511,2.7284,4.0719,1.3898,2.9909,3.2626,1.9894,3.6642,4.6865,2.3774,0.6475,0.8232,2.0944,4.6307,0.969,3.7959,2.1582,4.9662,1.3212,6.6593,4.4115,5.443,4.2324,1.405,2.1855,4.8749,1.6284,5.1574,0.0143,3.888,3.8189,3.1028,5.9473,0.8782,2.7098,5.9785,1.6378,1.7057,1.3829,1.3974,5.6951,9.4435,2.9977,0.5635]}
{"prompt":"You 're a scientist working on a social experiment called , `` M. modification '' , where one normal child is put into a school of mentally incapable children to see if the kid will try and fit in .","text":"You're a scientist working on a social experiment called, `` M. modification '', where one normal child is put into a school of mentally incapable children to see if the kid will try and fit in. The kids are all psychopaths and the school is run by Dr. Heller. Heller is a racist and believes in the theory that the White race is superior. But the kid who ends up in there is also a psychopath. Dr. Heller starts to realize that the kid and himself have a lot in common. What starts as being a scientific experiment ends up becoming a huge social experiment and the two psychopaths find happiness together. But how would you call this?\nIf the kids are all psychopaths it could mean they are psychopaths of a higher degree than normal humans. I could see it being an experiment where the psychopaths experiment on a normal child and see if the normal child can develop along the psychopathic lines of a normal person. Like a serial murderer on the outside looking to be a good person. That way they could find out if the person can develop psychopathic traits like a normal human being would. Another way of saying that is they experiment on normal people to find out what kind of a person they actually are. Like a way to learn the psyche of a normal human being.\nSounds like you're right though. Or maybe just experimenting on normal people to find out how their psyche is.\nIt's not meant to be seen as a criticism of the book or Heller. I feel like it just means that there are things in science that are just crazy. In that way it might be a good metaphor for the world today. A world where everyone and everything are experimented on to see what we really are and the kind of person we really are.\nThat's good to know. I'm glad you didn't call it a racist book. I guess it would be much easier to defend against accusations of racism if we stopped talking about the meaning of the book too much.\nI read a lot of fantasy, science fiction, and horror and scorned the idea of racism ever existing in those fields. Then one day a book came along that contradicted my beliefs and I was horrified. In the end I did not dismiss science fiction as racist. I could relate to the science and believe what was being said. I still do not find science fiction racist, but to be honest, I am not a fan.","token_len":488,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,6.0535,5.2107,1.295,1.0172,7.7589,1.1647,5.2624,4.6763,10.1227,12.1181,3.5249,16.0773,6.5204,1.9525,3.4131,4.5848,8.836,3.4768,1.2941,4.6611,1.2715,0.5073,5.4052,3.7502,9.6251,8.25,0.8205,3.908,3.5161,2.6928,2.764,5.5562,3.0585,6.321,2.8312,5.0098,0.9448,1.3791,2.3147,2.5577,1.2874,4.2527,6.7601,1.4317,1.6447,3.344,3.3041,1.1387,4.0611,0.1295,6.2981,0.1155,10.0796,1.3304,5.1928,1.5163,1.4069,6.2973,1.6218,4.8182,1.4804,2.0006,5.1913,0.394,2.2485,6.0535,0.4519,0.7472,3.3369,2.65,3.5074,2.1957,3.3928,2.4577,5.744,0.003,0.8385,5.7091,0.8559,3.9495,1.0082,1.8861,0.9413,4.1935,0.0077,0.0962,6.2774,1.8768,3.6525,0.402,1.637,1.5082,5.443,6.3259,2.8951,1.9673,3.4016,1.2383,0.0001,0.9342,5.401,6.7544,1.6516,5.016,1.0389,6.3167,0.3089,2.1543,0.1754,2.8717,0.457,6.1738,2.0562,0.0869,3.4704,2.4729,4.7344,5.9425,0.0655,5.2902,7.1672,1.8201,0.5028,3.5054,4.3529,4.0538,2.0927,6.1955,1.7778,4.1767,3.6244,7.9958,2.8061,2.1892,1.4119,2.1946,0.7372,0.0593,4.4452,3.962,2.5847,2.5868,1.3782,4.4725,0.4489,4.8298,2.3719,3.1075,3.6698,1.763,3.4035,4.0073,0.5969,3.8021,4.771,2.1341,2.9876,3.2969,3.6995,3.0897,2.3943,1.6172,3.3447,0.5062,6.5814,2.4038,1.9242,0.8869,0.7661,1.2672,3.8308,0.6624,2.0046,2.609,0.491,2.5737,6.386,7.0534,1.7441,8.9694,0.8092,1.5232,2.2558,2.5667,0.5516,2.0348,0.3329,6.676,2.6008,7.3637,4.1127,4.7222,1.683,5.3407,3.2685,6.969,2.8528,2.5983,2.4827,1.7552,1.0383,3.8899,4.2275,1.8945,1.6339,3.7272,2.2143,1.5656,1.2117,2.7695,3.3492,3.0576,5.6029,0.1087,0.9003,3.8536,3.1578,5.1884,2.6498,1.6189,3.8869,1.0622,6.7188,1.7521,2.0962,1.4792,1.594,1.4317,3.9628,6.6903,0.3054,2.4302,1.8795,3.4467,2.5203,0.1325,2.2624,2.3322,0.0067,3.2497,0.8043,0.4024,5.5369,0.0657,0.3373,4.7396,1.3515,7.6062,1.1589,5.9541,3.6871,7.9112,0.6531,0.7161,1.3814,1.7161,1.532,0.5865,1.319,10.0008,1.2261,2.3465,1.6088,4.3184,5.4364,0.4865,6.6035,1.4837,4.069,8.4158,0.6512,1.318,0.404,1.6687,0.8311,0.0749,2.1417,3.9649,2.892,2.2897,1.875,1.2383,3.3701,0.9468,2.3554,7.7078,0.2092,0.1967,6.138,0.2886,1.2656,7.1749,0.6986,1.4547,5.0424,2.644,12.6861,1.6687,1.4327,4.2222,0.4767,1.546,4.1894,3.8635,0.6766,2.6605,0.9611,3.5398,2.4773,4.4087,0.2956,1.2326,3.9965,5.7201,1.5197,4.2532,3.5954,2.3002,1.3917,3.9833,0.591,1.7876,3.103,4.7776,0.4813,1.7902,3.4634,5.1792,0.4326,5.1294,4.0154,0.702,4.3383,5.704,1.295,5.0043,9.0373,0.185,1.7209,1.0323,1.4353,4.6523,3.5026,2.0491,2.3492,3.7313,3.9252,0.0178,1.9429,0.1293,1.7592,0.0927,0.2069,1.3147,4.2649,0.9456,5.0247,1.8161,1.1773,0.5549,1.8635,1.9119,2.4448,1.0348,5.2328,0.0004,4.6672,0.3263,1.197,7.5918,0.6637,0.6755,1.4369,3.8288,1.587,3.0948,1.0213,4.8386,1.4214,0.558,6.8162,4.3828,5.4133,0.6227,0.7023,1.6754,2.6379,6.0661,2.8001,0.0533,2.5502,9.1151,0.1652,1.5908,1.5393,7.0591,0.1279,0.2051,0.9984,1.7656,4.9526,2.1486,0.5857,0.141,7.1195,3.1468,2.2864,0.0691,0.5396,0.9212,1.4251,2.7639,9.2482,11.5246,1.8838,1.2661,0.4026,4.0553,6.9258,13.6682,1.2658,4.129,4.0436,0.3961,5.8013,4.0775,0.102,3.5335,3.2132,0.6071,2.5727,1.0124,7.5605,1.3873,2.724,1.6171,1.4102,2.5157,4.1695,0.5673,4.5438,1.8522,2.1395,0.735,4.8376,2.4625,6.5057,5.767,0.2595,1.622,1.7154,1.2332,0.6037,5.867,5.4597,0.2343,1.5605,4.3745,3.2748,5.8721,4.5822,3.257,2.3454,0.8432,1.2149,1.2792,4.1819,2.3692,2.0368,5.0381,2.565,0.2839,1.3073,2.5891,1.0137,5.636,2.6176,0.7655,1.7976,0.6105,3.1404,1.5547,2.0995,2.2476,1.8854]}

Now he's suddenly in her life again and she starts to question whether or not she's the bad person he thinks she is. When she starts to have doubts about her feelings for him, he shows the truth about his past.\nIn a city of darkness and sin, they meet two people on opposite ends of the scale when they are both involved in a deadly accident. Their fate may be their salvation as well as their downfall. But the one thing they have in common is that they belong to a world where love can be both beautiful and terrifying.\nA story of betrayal in the most dangerous part of the world. Set against the backdrop of war, corruption, and the law which is on both sides. And a place where love can only grow harder with each passing day.\nThe first installment of the series, and even better than the second. What can you say about a good beginning...\nThere can be no doubt that the time of the year is upon us, The best time ever, to go and see a movie or two. I have had more than my fair share of enjoyment over the years from movies, I have watched many, and many more have fallen by the wayside but there some that stand out, The movies I have seen over the years have all been good and some great movies that I have even thought of putting on my list for the top ten movies of all time, If it is to be my list, then it is my list and only my list. As I look over all of the great movies that I have seen over the years, there are some films that are truly hard to leave behind, But there is one film that is on the top of my list, It has the power to draw me in, It has the quality and beauty that is timeless, It has the characters who just seem real and authentic and the stories they tell. It is hard to let go of those characters and the stories that they tell; you can feel what they feel, You can see what they see, You can feel what it is like to be in each of their shoes...I cannot think of a better way to wrap this up than with the best movie I have ever seen The Departed. This is a movie that will leave you with a lasting feeling of hope and hope is always at the top of my list of what makes a great movie...","token_len":489,"entropy":[5.881,4.78,0.1825,0.411,4.4505,5.7076,5.172,1.7869,1.5568,4.1837,2.4424,1.2054,7.9957,3.7652,3.8858,2.7011,1.749,2.9139,1.5059,6.5796,1.0128,3.5791,2.4777,2.1062,0.0006,1.0292,1.3934,3.2112,6.1777,2.8862,1.973,3.9222,0.0512,0.2078,0.2254,3.849,1.1537,4.406,0.4937,5.0945,1.3671,0.5055,1.4412,3.9768,1.673,0.5287,0.333,1.3924,5.5602,4.5043,2.8397,1.8081,2.1834,2.5143,1.7913,2.1064,9.0624,3.0528,6.684,2.9638,5.8043,1.3259,6.3684,0.2085,5.2843,2.5228,4.5295,2.9749,5.9353,3.5942,2.7477,0.0419,0.3077,5.6568,5.9614,0.768,3.3044,3.3583,5.5437,0.132,0.6967,4.4689,4.8526,0.4124,3.6304,4.069,4.0807,0.9884,6.2869,4.3435,4.0899,2.5097,0.7793,0.8359,4.6339,0.4255,3.0671,2.7198,4.6804,2.2613,0.9112,2.4729,0.1326,0.0009,0.1871,0.9029,0.3263,6.3797,0.249,1.1721,3.9897,1.6055,4.1751,3.0798,1.3084,4.9071,4.0738,0.0147,3.0697,0.2286,1.28,3.7704,4.2823,2.3224,4.0593,4.6847,1.6961,3.6889,4.4318,4.0131,0.0096,0.543,0.706,0.6776,7.6298,3.2661,1.2913,0.5977,0.0046,4.6001,1.0286,5.388,0.5721,0.6821,2.5329,6.4609,7.1572,2.7572,5.1622,5.9803,0.0451,2.248,4.9504,3.1274,4.844,0.4178,3.6027,1.2497,3.2483,5.1895,8.2929,3.431,0.7119,0.1231,0.4013,0.1468,0.963,2.8202,3.7706,4.7776,1.123,1.5279,1.6048,2.4246,4.9719,6.5265,3.4549,1.5976,0.6362,2.5268,1.6368,5.7866,3.6326,1.3754,2.1866,0.4664,5.8614,3.9117,6.1238,6.2954,1.2477,4.504,5.8248,0.3684,0.7574,1.6034,0.5431,1.824,6.6917,2.9612,1.1146,4.787,0.8715,4.7693,0.0659,2.2471,6.4838,6.401,1.3287,3.9241,3.0424,2.928,4.4843,3.9863,2.3525,2.2486,0.5949,2.2552,3.6686,0.7758,2.9998,2.664,4.0522,4.9,0.9923,2.1906,0.4037,0.0014,0.1085,6.4548,4.3427,0.2965,0.4771,1.8789,3.5046,1.944,4.115,1.9804,2.6468,2.6002,2.5792,4.0457,3.0589,1.1773,3.7845,5.4372,3.1976,0.1811,0.0212,0.001,5.4126,4.3745,9.0894,2.7985,3.8691,0.1384,3.5278,5.6672,4.7169,2.8396,1.3894,1.7204,3.1248,0.1744,0.1571,1.6702,1.6073,1.094,4.1189,2.1721,2.2989,5.2274,4.5885,2.0345,1.5369,1.4128,4.8633,4.6009,1.124,4.369,1.7951,1.5591,2.3671,3.2441,1.9908,5.7749,2.331,1.7014,0.6056,0.4093,0.0127,2.9368,5.8801,3.8737,2.2623,4.3149,0.5727,4.0152,2.9979,1.0502,1.8737,2.0616,1.549,2.6066,4.5532,2.8061,6.109,1.9016,0.5127,0.6664,4.5741,1.9615,3.66,3.7361,3.762,1.2403,1.004,2.3569,0.5189,1.7834,0.8515,0.2849,0.7536,0.5424,0.0516,0.0389,0.5548,3.0708,0.7966,1.5536,4.018,0.3048,2.2835,3.2472,5.6741,0.1342,5.6165,2.0053,1.6182,5.6428,2.5315,2.1801,1.008,2.1131,0.266,2.1515,5.6702,2.0242,2.7846,1.0714,0.1812,0.0723,1.6076,3.498,4.2161,3.3929,3.1298,0.17,7.3206,1.6066,1.2838,1.9773,2.5623,1.5734,0.5554,6.0294,2.4173,4.7286,1.2508,2.4763,6.4951,1.4255,0.9002,0.8524,0.3498,6.0202,2.6776,6.1084,4.2878,4.9919,1.5362,6.1549,2.3606,3.2901,3.6742,2.6507,0.1364,1.8375,2.0777,0.9485,4.4581,0.2095,4.9922,0.3754,0.4668,3.3008,3.9917,1.5486,2.4317,1.6964,1.1187,1.7805,0.2955,6.2255,4.7509,1.6208,2.5674,3.8682,1.2285,1.8065,2.0094,3.7245,0.1676,2.4688,1.9343,0.2746,3.0087,1.0684,1.4948,0.1255,1.4458,1.0452,4.5936,1.0642,1.1028,0.462,0.776,1.9669,6.078,1.7944,1.7473,3.4852,4.6121,4.9585,4.0018,3.4595,0.1155,0.7576,1.3497,2.0327,0.1346,4.8884,1.8154,0.9642,1.0691,2.0485,2.2738,4.0719,2.1435,1.9783,0.262,0.761,0.2002,7.1126,9.0286,0.1017,1.1158,4.1022,1.1341,1.3889,1.1017,0.4464,2.8318,2.7877,0.4301,1.9518,1.0662,5.6501,2.6245,0.7086,4.1813,1.1788,2.7087,5.4858,4.1509,4.3619,0.2011,2.0241,0.0567,0.4768,0.1231,2.4912,4.5349,3.9052,1.7167,1.042,0.1429,3.6876]}
{"prompt":"For the first time in a long time , the ash turned to snow .","text":"For the first time in a long time, the ash turned to snow. The sun rose and in the east we had a breeze. It felt like spring, the trees were in full bloom. I walked to the barn and saw a little white doe. We named her Sandy. I think she loved me and loved to sleep in my lap. Then I noticed a large doe in the yard.\nShe was huge. We looked at the other doe from a different angle and then they made a big hissing sound and walked away, probably into the woods. Both of them were beautiful doe. They were very curious about us. One of them came over to us and we were afraid that she would eat us, she must have been big enough to eat a man. But she was gentle.\nIt was a very good day, the ground was soft and it was a perfect time to plant corn. The trees came into the light, the saplings began to show their leaves and you could see that spring was coming. We took pictures of the trees from a nearby stand and sat under the trees and ate our lunch and saw some other animals on the road. We saw a lot of wild turkeys. I think the birds did not appreciate our presence.\nAfter lunch we walked farther up the road and saw a deer. I took his picture with my phone only. We came to my grandpa\u2019s house. My grandpa gave us a nice welcome, he saw us and was surprised. Now we were here we can relax and do whatever we wanted, he agreed. He had a very nice house with large, shady trees around it, a grassy field, and several sheep. But mostly he had a cat. He let us feed him, he gave us a lot of treats, and let the kids play with him and pet him. He had a very large garden.\nLater on, we made pancakes for breakfast in his kitchen. As you can imagine every child had a lot of pancakes, but grandpa did not notice it. And then we ate some eggs and saw more sheep. He let me get in his car and ride up to the top of the hill on the other side, he told me I could pick strawberries from the top of the hill. He put a piece of wire rope around his leg so I could climb there. It was a nice place to rest from the walking.","token_len":490,"entropy":[2.5562,2.3636,0.3803,0.9041,2.6162,1.4755,0.149,0.358,2.2225,12.3092,7.9177,2.096,5.3275,0.9551,1.901,4.3038,2.7646,1.8948,7.1312,1.0014,6.1941,4.4247,3.1753,1.5711,7.0901,1.438,2.8772,5.4404,1.0176,4.9563,1.8338,2.823,6.5825,1.3903,4.3986,2.8339,0.134,1.0669,2.8428,3.6406,2.4614,0.4642,5.7973,1.1848,2.7319,1.5239,3.2971,3.9323,8.6383,1.7669,2.1466,3.4948,8.1474,1.318,7.4621,0.5658,1.9081,4.8403,1.4094,6.2395,1.5838,2.6114,3.6493,3.4724,4.4887,2.0669,0.957,3.5513,0.3123,3.8946,1.0611,3.6909,1.8103,3.8466,5.8633,0.0615,2.7344,0.5912,3.413,0.5666,3.8875,7.5384,1.3583,6.4474,0.8732,3.7114,4.2485,0.858,2.7965,5.0139,0.9265,0.2898,5.702,3.7512,3.2102,0.7046,1.6718,3.5018,5.3561,5.8127,1.4602,2.1826,10.4696,1.0025,0.6772,2.0601,4.5064,0.8896,3.6904,5.5515,4.9254,0.3828,1.0261,0.2283,7.6461,1.2067,0.8396,1.3046,5.2085,2.582,0.5879,0.5253,2.3249,1.174,3.243,5.5901,2.3752,2.4106,0.7677,3.8927,0.7718,0.371,4.2491,2.743,0.8859,1.5155,0.2584,3.7619,2.9209,4.6794,2.4621,1.4531,1.09,4.9412,1.1132,2.7181,3.6997,5.3332,0.4264,1.7546,6.1056,2.3367,0.5821,1.0037,2.505,3.6195,0.6656,3.492,1.4397,1.8457,6.1341,1.6654,2.7983,4.0071,0.461,2.1475,2.2772,2.7292,1.653,2.4894,2.9786,6.4599,0.4333,3.0227,0.5724,3.8064,0.6625,3.2995,5.3224,4.0232,0.6599,5.7814,6.3332,0.8716,2.3816,3.4134,4.9622,3.6788,2.1122,5.8053,2.2294,1.7035,8.4259,0.0542,4.0686,0.1704,5.9436,1.5789,2.6712,1.5884,5.8627,0.3096,0.3971,2.2091,8.5978,0.4102,1.0935,0.5077,2.2327,4.0865,4.3041,0.9229,0.9914,2.4379,4.9671,2.459,4.7092,5.5094,1.147,7.277,6.5254,1.1682,1.9465,1.9886,4.176,2.8543,3.7161,2.9623,5.7583,3.4963,4.4439,5.0891,4.3666,0.262,4.7213,0.3555,1.9975,3.9235,1.8839,2.7241,0.0833,3.2102,5.7216,0.0224,1.7738,2.2617,2.3679,2.5304,2.8243,4.556,1.5098,5.6703,2.658,3.2482,0.9339,1.3131,4.2924,2.9622,0.9595,3.4839,7.1228,2.9159,0.3484,1.0093,1.0315,2.2457,1.0383,4.7649,1.4645,1.7127,4.041,5.4595,0.5173,3.345,1.1191,2.216,9.9764,1.8914,2.1719,5.008,1.0921,5.1594,8.4044,1.7196,16.5258,8.2875,3.5969,0.4512,1.6809,3.2953,0.9062,0.0214,3.9204,1.6305,0.8044,4.0568,5.9151,2.48,1.8103,5.0494,1.6732,0.8862,3.9408,4.2202,1.5635,6.6448,1.8241,1.7876,5.0254,6.7728,4.9585,5.8523,0.9931,4.1058,3.4067,0.1929,4.5127,2.7938,2.5333,6.431,0.5167,2.5663,3.1223,1.6479,3.9501,1.2985,3.0897,2.5487,5.4222,4.5114,6.9574,2.0955,6.5885,0.686,2.2106,3.0913,6.8943,0.4291,1.7553,1.7415,1.4678,5.6082,6.6527,1.0082,4.7997,7.4323,1.2162,2.2719,1.1798,5.5916,1.0838,1.3572,5.7499,1.0346,5.4322,0.8268,2.174,1.4503,3.0614,0.3748,1.5624,2.0968,0.0494,2.3793,1.1756,0.8997,5.6979,3.8473,4.1826,0.9126,0.8762,0.7936,2.6951,5.4793,0.6337,0.3947,1.5913,2.4155,0.7882,3.0815,3.4128,4.341,1.9546,1.6275,5.4235,1.8229,1.8203,1.6399,4.7037,6.8067,2.2926,2.8908,3.8532,2.1779,2.1936,0.5475,5.3853,3.8032,0.6134,1.0858,6.7168,5.3849,4.4993,1.0832,4.6769,0.1129,1.4409,1.9883,1.7987,8.7676,0.0461,3.716,0.331,7.2052,2.4671,0.5108,5.1614,2.7801,1.5421,2.6197,2.3182,3.504,1.1875,7.0517,4.9898,5.333,0.6405,2.4837,4.1783,2.872,4.1486,5.1892,1.476,0.5863,0.6113,4.512,2.6084,0.7565,0.8185,4.7395,0.1515,0.1614,0.3055,4.6838,1.2931,1.9611,0.0169,3.2577,2.373,3.1327,0.4023,4.1691,2.0514,5.6426,8.0153,2.521,0.4845,3.3798,0.6919,0.1907,0.1266,0.9323,2.0417,4.4089,1.7522,4.945,0.0588,4.4671,6.5589,1.3616,1.8577,3.8583,2.3786,0.8711,0.1671,2.7911,5.4698,0.5802,3.1859,0.4317,1.5185,2.561,3.0194,0.7194,4.1929,5.1167,0.694,7.8259,0.6651]}
{"prompt":"On Halloween at exactly 11:15 , the dead try to call their loved ones .","text":"On Halloween at exactly 11:15, the dead try to call their loved ones. We are trying to make this Halloween special for your children and we need our parents to help. This year, you will have the best day of your lives to help us provide the funds we need to operate. I hope to see you there for the live and virtual events. We will never let your children down.\nThe following blog post was written by one of our donors! The donor wrote that we were a blessing to him. He was able to be an angel to a poor child who was unable to buy books.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that 2020 is in the rearview mirror and it\u2019s safe to say that a new year has arrived. A new decade. Many have expressed frustration with the lack of progress on the Covid problem, but I would like to take a moment to reevaluate the past year.\nIf you have a dog, there are a lot of decisions to be made before we finally have to say goodbye. From dog food to a new cage, you will have to decide what you want as the next step in your dog\u2019s life.\nThe day my family and I made the decision to adopt a homeless dog from the shelter, the joy in my heart was just like the joy that you will be feeling after adopting a new puppy.\nI used to think that my relationship with my cat, Charlie, was an \u201cunderstated\u201d one. We lived together; he stayed near me to feel safe even though I rarely left my house except for short trips. Charlie loved to run across our yard, and he loved to get in the sun whenever the sun was shining.\nWhen my kids were little, they needed a safe place to run. So, I put up a cat tree, and they were happy to jump in for a playful romp.\nMy cats, like my dogs, had human children. They went to school with us. They played, and lived like family, with the children, as long as they were safe.\nThat all changed when my youngest child, now in middle school, began to have nightmares about a cat. Our cat, who was not afraid of children, showed a frightened expression when he saw my child. For hours there didn\u2019t seem to be any change; Charlie seemed to be just standing there with the little girl.","token_len":490,"entropy":[10.8259,5.3979,9.8957,3.3028,0.6705,3.3321,3.5583,2.2856,8.0629,10.2109,0.2788,6.3978,2.4362,2.7401,0.031,1.7961,5.343,3.1348,4.5311,0.1466,2.9041,2.6417,4.8492,2.768,2.362,4.4269,3.064,1.8534,3.3123,3.1747,5.9891,4.3092,0.5289,2.5737,2.039,4.1487,2.2838,1.2288,3.5015,1.7092,2.1736,1.7923,5.265,5.2055,0.2792,0.1826,2.1703,3.4616,3.419,1.393,5.8233,2.2301,5.3013,1.6797,0.1071,0.3978,7.8988,2.5477,5.4332,2.9059,2.5063,1.3978,0.3303,2.1904,3.5427,1.5,7.3458,4.8216,8.4977,4.9529,1.6692,2.7809,2.0317,5.1204,3.2698,3.4453,1.5946,0.5074,0.6526,1.5829,8.3357,4.1732,6.2927,0.035,6.2572,0.0033,0.0638,5.0639,0.2488,0.9078,4.7005,5.692,4.8212,4.0843,5.4885,4.3804,3.8199,3.2566,4.4454,7.4941,0.7767,2.7975,1.6332,1.6696,2.4954,3.3909,0.0128,5.1852,4.0435,3.6442,2.4879,3.6215,5.3669,1.8464,2.0362,1.4217,3.5275,0.0291,4.8271,6.8916,2.0369,2.5172,4.7627,16.2746,7.4285,2.053,3.2099,0.3296,1.2385,0.7989,13.2874,0.8892,4.0556,0.9811,4.0819,0.243,0.0654,3.3668,3.3481,3.5643,0.1231,0.0219,7.1521,0.22,0.3178,0.3104,4.022,4.4685,3.1487,2.7897,1.1081,0.7454,3.811,0.8108,5.6208,2.091,5.3484,3.667,4.6394,5.354,1.2637,0.711,2.24,0.0068,2.173,1.7103,1.6973,16.5824,3.8691,16.0894,1.8737,1.2754,2.586,3.47,0.5585,0.083,3.4415,1.1451,0.2783,0.1599,6.1161,4.6606,1.2705,4.8396,1.1725,0.9258,2.0093,5.1237,0.8693,1.9558,2.3242,6.8057,1.1701,4.689,1.0679,2.2192,1.3092,0.046,7.0916,1.4944,1.5186,0.0385,4.3709,2.9182,5.8247,2.4297,2.8797,5.0179,0.4238,1.2826,6.2271,6.243,4.2468,0.6512,4.7049,2.1779,7.6436,1.0403,3.8969,1.7651,1.4133,0.3999,2.0137,1.5046,1.8973,0.4831,5.4636,3.1609,3.6768,1.8314,1.2041,0.7919,3.0549,6.2232,0.5456,0.3343,0.6397,0.237,1.5291,2.8797,5.3794,5.5916,3.4316,1.2455,0.186,4.5004,1.4776,0.4554,0.19,3.6186,1.6883,6.0803,1.2578,3.8123,1.3554,2.0861,1.4529,2.775,6.0411,4.5637,1.6749,0.3579,1.6324,5.1957,4.7171,2.2373,3.7352,2.6543,3.4918,2.9918,3.4356,2.1968,3.2253,2.5347,0.7939,2.0319,2.7694,0.678,1.5584,1.7386,6.0842,0.174,2.2696,0.7092,3.1027,5.8969,0.0862,0.4833,3.7738,2.2546,5.435,0.1721,0.6127,4.3861,17.3176,4.9688,8.7391,6.1746,3.1478,6.8338,3.6529,0.4626,3.0339,4.3692,1.1212,7.1157,2.458,5.7091,6.6591,0.6599,4.7529,6.8268,1.9888,7.02,1.396,1.401,5.2509,4.3704,2.3963,1.483,6.7205,1.3915,6.5823,1.9788,1.4823,3.1094,4.1066,1.5578,3.523,4.7498,3.5529,1.647,1.5572,1.8015,1.9964,3.1316,0.6728,4.0871,2.8722,1.511,3.96,4.4463,3.5571,1.2216,0.9204,1.3109,0.4179,2.175,3.3151,2.4796,4.1409,0.8635,1.5104,0.2929,2.5364,5.7369,1.6217,3.5614,0.3734,0.1667,3.7459,1.713,4.0205,1.6939,1.6961,4.5841,4.0257,1.2257,4.3472,7.9464,2.7135,1.3353,3.4086,2.6007,2.8917,1.1934,5.1193,1.5135,4.3037,0.9198,7.8732,9.6981,0.0235,0.823,1.7248,3.3205,2.9049,2.8869,3.9345,1.7808,1.5527,0.0997,3.3088,8.3206,5.8704,1.0991,1.8894,5.5186,0.829,1.6247,1.2626,2.0208,1.517,1.2382,4.0422,4.3066,1.7415,5.7299,5.5148,3.3781,3.1605,2.9229,2.6886,3.5405,3.1084,3.5319,3.3578,0.0142,0.7921,1.7846,2.1406,0.5644,1.1851,4.4857,5.0943,0.1207,1.0434,2.0084,4.6533,2.8476,0.6889,5.5559,4.5789,3.7041,0.2693,0.0912,3.5595,0.8894,3.2233,3.47,1.1812,3.4007,1.8242,1.3787,5.7369,2.0703,1.9606,2.8424,1.1866,3.7763,4.1535,0.9619,5.2824,0.3207,5.5927,3.4058,6.6778,1.1389,2.0213,1.1428,1.5734,2.5634,2.4103,1.2536,6.1293,5.701,6.6876,8.0151,1.5388,1.84,0.0416,1.337,0.0376,0.0441,0.84,5.9351,5.3891,4.3799,4.0853,0.9219,1.1617,4.4605,5.9613,0.4004,3.1952,2.6383,3.7887,3.5692,0.9628]}

You feel a slight sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like you have been in this room before. As you climb into the escape ship, you start to feel a wave of emotions. You close your eyes and concentrate. Your legs are shaking from the claustrophobic feeling. Your stomach sinks down as the ship swirls.\nThere is only one single escape room.

You are about to get out when they suddenly change to a low value. You turn it all up a decibels. The air conditioning system in your room changes to the lowest temperatures. You feel a chill run over you. There are no signs of lights coming on or doors opening, or anything. The temperature inside the room is dropping faster than you ever expected. You can feel the moisture on your face. You are scared. You open your eyes. The escape ship hasn't moved. You see your phone on your table, with the time still showing as 2:50 pm. It turns out that you were in a time loop.

They present their conclusions about the race that sent them. - Science - WATCH - Duration: 13:03:25.\nThis is a picture from the night sky, taken by a camera aboard NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn. On November 2, 2007, we saw a strange light appear in the sky north-east of Saturn...\nThe mysterious Saturn's rings. Saturn's rings are the largest bodies of material in the solar system. How big they are. Saturn's rings are composed of solid small particles, called \"ice,\" that float around around the ring as they have been for the last four billion years.\nSaturn's rings have been the focus of scientific research for nearly 4.5 billion years. At first researchers thought only that the rings were the result of a collision between larger bodies in the solar system. However, through years of observations, scientists could see that the rings are much older, making them likely to have been formed in the very distant past of the solar system.\nThe ring system of Saturn is arguably one of the most spectacular features in the solar system, and has been known for over four-quarters of a century. Since that time, the ring system has remained a favorite study of scientists. Saturn's rings, known by astronomers as the Rings System, are made up of a number of concentric rings, made up of dust particles and other debris, and are also composed of gases. Many theories have been suggested for how the rings formed in the past, yet there are not yet solid solutions to explain how the rings formed in the first place. The study of the rings is therefore very important for understanding the formation of the solar system.

But that is a story for another day\nThe one thing that sets me apart is my ability to be in every room and on every screen. I love the chance to interact with people, to be present in every scene, in every movie.\nI'm still learning every day. There are a lot of things I'm curious about but right now I'm learning more about how to use the platform and the technology and the opportunities that are out there.\nNo, I like to do it all; script development, writing, production, directing and, of course, acting. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, especially since so many different skills and talents are required, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the process of developing a really great movie.\nFor me, every day is a different adventure to be a human on the front lines. And we\u2019re all human on the front lines. I think people forget just how amazing it is to have the chance to be a movie star in this industry, to see the world and to work with the most talented, accomplished people on the planet, with stars you want to be working with. I\u2019m excited every day for that opportunity, and to be a part of a movie that can create that opportunity for others.\nI'm hoping to do more screenwriter roles down the road, but I always dream of getting my hands dirty and being more involved in the actual making of the movie. I\u2019m very interested in putting the scripts that I\u2019ve written in action, in making movies that will have an impact in the world.\nI\u2019m extremely proud of the impact that I've made as an activist. I see it every day in my career where I have the chance to come into work and talk to people about this and that and then come back to work. I think that\u2019s so important. It\u2019s very fulfilling to be able to put my voice to use, to be a voice for an issue that I care about, and it\u2019s always better to do it and be positive rather than ignore it.\nStay tuned, as I'm sure you'll find me here often in the future. I love being a human being, this amazing, magical place, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world.

{"prompt":"Describe a pocket watch to someone who has never seen one before and has no comprehension of time represented by clocks .","text":"Describe a pocket watch to someone who has never seen one before and has no comprehension of time represented by clocks. A pocket watch can be a small wrist watch or a watch worn over the pocket. In modern times, the term is used to describe wrist watches as well as pocket watches. In the early 1800s, men\u2019s watches were worn over the pocket, while women wore a wrist watch. The watch can come with a chain.\nA watch is an object that displays time. A pocket watch is a watch worn over the pocket and can be small enough to be put in the pocket or worn over the arm. A wrist-watch is a watch that is worn on the wrist and is not attached to the pocket or the collar. Unlike some pocket watches, the wrist watch does not need to be turned to display time. The hand is moved to show time. Wrist watches come with a chain, leather strap, watch-fit, and some come with interchangeable bands.\nIn order to make a pocket watch, a face is attached to a clock mechanism. Two hands and minute divisions are on the face and time is shown by moving the hands. A small battery provides an electrical current to the battery and clock mechanism. A pocket watch is made of steel, brass, aluminum, and some plastic.\nIn addition to a watch, a pocket that holds a watch is called a watch pocket. When a pocket watch is placed in the pocket, it is called a pocket watch. When the pocket watch is worn over the arm, it is called a wrist watch. Women wear wrist watches, and men wear two-pack watches with a bracelet. Many pocket watches have the chain that attaches the watch to the pocket. Women wear watches with a leather band. Men wear watches with a watch band.\nIn the early 1800s, women wore wrist watches, especially on dresses. Watches in the 1800s were attached with a pocket chain. They were worn like a bracelet.

{"prompt":"Write a story about anything you like , run it through Google translate a few times into various languages , translate it back into English , and then post the result .","text":"Write a story about anything you like, run it through Google translate a few times into various languages, translate it back into English, and then post the result. Use the Google Translate plugin to do the translation, but always use English as the source language and the final version must have English as the title. Also, you don't have to be very hardcore about language : a joke in Italian or something like that is fine. The idea is just for you to create new stories. Good luck!\nIn the new issue there is a story about one of the new games we have from Konami. It is called the Lost Odyssey and it is based on the work of Penelope Fitzgerald who wrote an original novel about Odysseus and the nine years he stayed back on the Ithaca. I didn't realize it, but the new game is named Odyssey.\nAnyway, our story is a kind of mashup of the book and the classic Odyssey of Homer and we actually did try to use some scenes in the book, but we went way out of the way to actually bring Odysseus into a time where he was a teenager in his life and he was trying to leave his island home and go out and explore and to find himself. The plot of the film, of course, doesn't follow the story of the book, but I think it gives a pretty good idea of what the book was about in many different ways. For example, there is some of the same kind of discussion about the idea that the human soul is eternal and how you can find yourself, and the whole idea of seeking identity.\nOne of the other movies is sort of a cross between the first movie and the second movie of the Star Wars series. It is called Dark Times in the Rebel Alliance and a lot of people are trying to find out what the hell is going on in it, and I think it is a pretty good watch. It is a movie that shows how they did those two movies in a way that makes it very interesting to watch.\nIn the magazine, there are a couple of articles on the work of John Williams, and his music in several of the movies and some of the Star Wars movies. I actually talked to him today and he is just very happy to have his music used in Star Wars. Some of the songs and music that he wrote for the first movies can be heard with the theme you hear in the Star Wars movies.","token_len":494,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,5.8966,1.9331,1.8995,2.0755,8.8948,0.8809,1.3854,5.3894,6.7938,8.5276,0.6837,0.5904,8.2239,7.4074,0.1806,1.4402,6.8042,0.6838,3.4505,1.271,0.6222,0.7298,0.8923,1.4768,2.7734,2.8085,4.2946,1.9991,5.7895,1.5319,3.8174,2.0633,0.0718,4.4698,0.6856,3.2575,2.3017,2.7065,2.4902,2.8053,4.6195,2.1038,2.6799,2.1159,0.687,3.5273,0.5068,4.0941,3.274,5.9024,2.06,4.4066,3.167,1.8517,1.2765,0.325,4.2574,0.5508,4.6534,0.814,3.1376,3.3199,0.0005,1.3016,0.0151,3.2016,4.4563,8.2886,0.7053,6.2325,8.834,5.3153,6.7994,3.4418,6.5183,2.4488,4.8603,1.4801,0.0196,2.1922,1.5224,0.9043,3.6306,4.9299,0.6623,4.5284,4.2447,3.0351,0.2135,4.4114,4.9775,2.0091,2.4648,6.6943,0.3236,1.4703,0.8822,7.1363,1.7164,6.0139,5.849,4.4196,1.1387,0.5599,4.5168,0.8158,5.0551,0.8319,0.6712,5.0189,5.9326,3.5176,2.5405,6.249,7.0875,1.1407,1.8666,1.1492,1.1681,5.5408,6.1405,5.2292,1.9835,0.817,0.8095,3.4186,0.2663,0.788,5.326,0.1672,8.9014,0.46,7.2331,3.2291,3.0574,4.0833,2.7869,3.5392,1.7679,9.7152,1.108,0.0063,0.0018,2.0821,1.7386,9.4544,4.4932,1.5065,7.2463,6.6563,2.1485,1.7918,8.1006,2.4516,0.0108,5.0317,3.1988,4.6655,0.0007,3.2775,2.3156,3.902,0.3734,2.4559,5.9032,0.9651,1.0798,4.0305,3.9331,1.5435,1.8097,5.4934,0.2282,6.1907,1.7454,1.2656,3.0932,6.0318,0.0273,7.0962,0.5553,0.4047,1.3296,5.4763,1.1926,0.8901,6.3983,5.5936,4.704,6.8403,2.2349,5.7464,6.0238,3.7997,4.556,0.5221,3.5121,2.5788,7.0397,3.177,0.7658,1.1664,2.0934,0.7391,2.4855,5.9917,4.4951,3.3186,0.1139,2.1404,1.5941,0.4572,6.2276,5.2029,4.5406,0.0021,0.0046,0.0006,2.9076,4.119,6.5783,2.0702,1.1362,1.4702,2.6621,5.8368,3.3999,2.4125,4.864,1.6307,2.3003,1.4679,3.3953,0.0495,5.2582,1.6279,5.4121,3.0029,1.3811,2.5878,4.2859,1.8063,4.1622,2.6032,3.0615,2.6884,4.035,1.3619,2.7452,5.5046,1.9417,1.2281,6.6354,3.848,3.5008,0.1014,0.0694,5.3508,0.0004,4.1122,1.5118,1.3767,0.9611,1.8584,1.3662,0.9937,0.6617,3.2059,1.3479,1.1497,4.5471,1.4846,4.0333,0.5432,1.3414,0.203,0.7272,1.6668,3.8667,1.9529,0.8705,3.6267,5.9715,4.4868,0.0702,0.4463,4.2558,0.7375,0.1593,2.5619,0.9935,3.4564,4.3264,0.512,4.0848,3.7871,0.0018,7.4469,1.2592,1.7232,5.2651,1.6684,2.4378,4.5398,4.2864,1.0704,5.9967,1.1564,6.0393,4.1194,0.9358,3.7867,3.6553,3.776,2.1166,2.8376,4.7078,1.3165,0.7622,6.8479,7.2069,3.199,1.8462,4.1688,0.5494,0.1307,4.0219,6.7448,4.0677,8.3606,0.0184,1.3965,4.9294,0.0772,1.251,3.9741,2.6081,0.5172,0.8064,2.0906,0.6574,4.056,0.6772,6.3674,0.8575,2.5548,0.565,1.3447,0.6893,2.2738,6.1199,5.95,4.113,1.6843,11.6654,0.4317,1.4567,5.1003,2.0061,0.0296,1.4832,2.3971,4.1056,0.0215,2.7887,0.7005,1.0843,2.6618,3.567,1.6867,0.1125,0.01,1.6449,3.9889,1.8898,1.3751,2.1459,0.6501,1.5526,0.9183,1.9911,1.9535,0.9656,6.8098,0.7256,1.8815,0.8577,1.6839,3.289,1.7644,4.4677,2.274,5.8957,4.4963,7.8171,3.1987,0.7021,2.7351,2.2125,1.4108,0.3614,3.7324,1.7227,2.9864,1.5663,1.7879,0.6814,0.7855,1.1299,3.179,0.739,8.7541,2.2523,1.4299,1.2307,1.3969,2.0726,0.4235,2.4363,2.4725,1.2121,5.7089,0.2594,4.3998,4.2724,1.5745,2.5195,4.3717,6.2137,3.9789,6.7858,1.4962,0.7074,2.4978,3.0486,3.228,0.3477,0.4079,6.0422,0.049,1.1297,0.4793,2.0251,4.7041,6.3079,0.494,0.6795,6.6088,2.0902,0.4763,2.885,4.9297,2.7929,3.835,1.0765,2.7069,4.8946,1.8238,4.4404,0.6481,3.0842,0.0087,1.2485,5.8329,0.3262,0.6351,2.6038,4.3075,3.3066,1.8448,1.0205,2.7284,1.4603,1.0636,3.2498,3.6369,4.8253,0.2326,1.8024,5.6225,1.475,6.88,7.508,1.6497,0.5757,0.54,2.1032,0.0077,0.7264,0.7313]}

The worlds mineral resources are exhausted and the Antarctic Treaty has just expired causing a war between the world's biggest nations. The UN has declared war on itself by sending a probe into the Antarctic to locate a massive power source -The Infinity Cube -which was stolen by terrorists 25 years ago. What they find threatens the very existence of man and the earth. Who are these terrorists, why did the UN send the probe? What dangers will the probe face? And what are the possible consequences? These are some of the questions that this series will attempt to answer...\nIt's the year 1997. After a war with a dying race of aliens called The Zodiacs has destroyed almost all human civilisation, a man named William Gibson goes on a quest on foot, to save his family and the lives of others. He knows that humanity still has one hope, to learn their ancient technology and send a last warning message to the aliens. (Source: Amazon)\nThis is a book about how humanity is dying and we need to take action on our own. I liked this book because it is very informative and it makes you think how seriously we humans want to take on our environment. It is important for us not only to care about the environment but also for ourselves. I think it\u2019s also important to understand that the world can still change. I also like it because it made me a lot more aware of how dangerous our world is. The ozone layer is melting because of things like cars and people are not taking care of their environment. The book also explains how to save what little we can and how we can use resources to help the environment. It's not just about the world; it shows that we need to take care of ourselves and think about our future.\nLONDON: The man who became the world\u2019s richest footballer, Ronaldo, has finally been caught on camera showing off his huge collection of cars.\nOn Thursday and Friday, two videos of Cristiano Ronaldo putting his vehicle in a very odd position were shot and uploaded to the Internet by a Spanish Instagram page \u2018Insta Cars\u2019.\nThe Italian driver, Francesco Finozzi, is accused of driving his car in such an unusual position with his rear view mirror up.\nThere were many jokes about the \u2018inconvenient\u2019 angle that these videos were taken in, but the reality is that this has happened to some famous personalities too.","token_len":496,"entropy":[4.1906,5.9315,9.6968,1.3782,2.9943,7.7164,11.8943,2.9464,0.9103,4.8259,1.6702,1.5281,8.7988,7.268,1.9692,4.313,2.5242,9.5022,2.0944,4.3151,1.4824,0.7991,3.2047,0.5247,4.2639,2.665,0.7153,1.9756,4.3904,2.1439,3.089,1.1218,0.3814,7.1749,3.4986,3.1905,2.0803,7.3383,1.6921,0.6156,2.6067,2.1611,4.4222,2.2518,4.2436,6.7759,3.6119,4.401,8.6861,7.8385,5.3772,1.1472,4.3013,3.8649,5.2839,0.7778,6.8764,8.7924,0.1788,0.0815,0.6197,5.6648,4.286,1.436,7.5933,0.9883,3.629,1.1806,0.0217,5.2969,1.5052,1.8603,5.2183,0.7286,5.4474,2.1725,1.5661,4.1187,2.3747,3.5405,2.3813,2.4191,3.1482,3.1159,1.7432,0.7553,1.6488,2.3611,7.0694,2.9336,1.7238,5.4641,2.9617,0.9571,2.5386,1.248,2.5971,0.55,4.5579,0.7926,2.0479,5.2297,0.6365,2.2251,0.1355,0.0436,0.7425,1.0269,5.2872,3.1243,0.9491,4.8636,0.0256,0.1024,4.3101,1.7474,7.3896,0.9304,2.3507,0.3965,10.785,0.4988,5.0502,1.8156,3.9843,1.2396,3.5488,6.4485,3.7095,1.227,2.6063,3.4262,3.0794,6.2081,1.963,2.5754,4.3708,3.774,5.4824,0.6008,3.2279,3.547,1.0253,2.8964,4.5143,0.5778,5.2358,5.3469,5.2275,0.93,0.3385,1.479,5.88,8.1596,3.61,2.3321,2.8474,1.4467,2.9714,1.9208,2.3512,3.8225,0.0335,3.0293,0.4209,2.2662,6.1253,1.2026,3.8002,5.6514,0.7837,4.8529,3.893,2.1674,3.4415,6.7719,5.3082,4.923,5.6094,0.9148,6.1797,1.9268,7.908,3.4604,5.8817,0.6686,0.9244,3.1493,0.8183,7.1312,3.2834,0.5551,5.083,1.5515,0.7782,3.1807,1.0491,2.7755,4.4724,1.234,4.1502,3.2106,2.1689,3.8639,1.7329,4.264,1.671,0.4073,3.3235,0.7691,4.0019,2.3299,0.5077,0.4839,4.1861,6.9909,1.324,0.4799,2.402,0.4542,2.6088,2.718,5.4687,0.896,2.7401,3.721,2.161,1.5185,5.5193,6.7603,1.237,6.54,5.2755,0.0907,0.114,5.7844,1.9815,6.2558,0.49,1.7531,1.3718,4.8833,2.0103,1.4648,3.9562,1.9073,0.1635,5.6558,0.4017,1.1167,1.2978,1.089,0.5329,2.6593,2.57,1.0561,1.9944,2.426,1.7358,19.0442,6.9253,1.9678,4.3571,0.9977,1.089,2.5876,1.2122,2.5529,2.3499,4.7241,3.3635,2.9168,2.0761,3.093,4.0078,2.1549,2.836,0.1887,0.4965,6.9487,0.2555,5.28,2.9436,0.5552,1.3226,0.1624,2.3438,4.2878,2.3139,2.3078,1.0664,0.8986,3.0173,11.6882,0.1806,0.7454,3.1594,4.6827,0.7102,6.9941,0.4102,8.1873,1.2338,4.5049,4.8324,3.9044,3.1724,1.7003,0.034,1.7279,2.7474,0.751,2.1644,8.6493,2.0114,3.5546,1.3372,2.0895,3.44,6.8267,3.377,1.6244,2.7471,1.8523,1.8357,1.885,0.3042,3.5692,5.0383,0.9661,1.9111,2.1258,1.5871,0.6024,2.1136,2.8798,3.0189,1.2835,0.4488,2.0446,3.0776,3.9228,0.6485,7.4605,2.0609,1.5557,2.1906,0.1912,1.7179,4.0533,0.0663,1.0357,1.4368,5.6571,0.7862,2.1354,2.3552,0.459,1.6309,6.4952,5.9342,1.3781,2.4859,6.6698,0.9355,5.4928,1.1479,2.248,9.4551,0.3421,0.8277,4.4098,7.7304,1.9376,6.1296,0.4543,1.6794,5.3842,2.5015,3.8126,3.348,1.3002,5.3599,0.9585,0.4014,5.7443,2.3978,0.0322,5.6423,1.0649,2.8889,4.7075,3.7096,6.0142,0.2768,1.354,5.2054,5.4028,1.7398,6.0282,0.0024,0.0036,7.802,1.7695,6.8851,1.6398,2.0403,6.6318,6.3928,0.5766,2.7192,4.7314,2.8688,1.9796,0.6166,2.5879,1.8463,2.4185,1.7843,5.6277,7.1324,6.5107,7.0993,6.6559,6.6141,2.4894,6.8388,0.5803,0.8592,1.0571,1.5067,1.5179,6.7723,4.8071,1.8461,9.1955,0.0332,4.7945,4.9522,4.8617,0.3907,2.0229,5.4027,0.1186,2.3897,2.0642,1.0524,2.2574,3.3703,2.5542,1.4131,2.1539,3.955,1.2768,4.684,4.0436,0.0928,4.7903,2.253,1.4268,4.7773,2.4743,2.7289,6.8593,1.3333,1.1626,11.7798,0.6975,6.3227,4.6476,1.471,1.0208,2.5681,5.6045,3.0559,5.466,1.2628,1.3622,1.0523,2.7225,1.6811,0.8595,1.8867,3.8376,0.5483,0.3615,2.4509,4.7567,2.7866,2.6454,3.6967,5.9436,6.4159,4.6954,0.3887]}

A device is sent to find the most average human to accept the challenge and duel for the fate of Earth. It's you. How will you adapt to a new world ruled over by machines and robots, which only think it best to kill?\nWe all know, one day, we will grow to the next level, we will feel that we have made a mistake, we will be confused about the future. But then I think to myself that even if life changes, you still have this game for something else to do. When something great happens, you can just start over and change your life.\nWe are all the same and do the same things. We all get a chance, and every day should be great because nothing is guaranteed. Everything in life, even your career, has no guarantees, but by working hard, you can get through everything. Life is not only a moment, but a sequence of many moments.\nEverything happens in its own time. Some people make the decisions for themselves while others act according to the plan.\nThe most beautiful things in life are given not calculated. If you want something, go on, and you will have it. Life is a gift, take advantage of it.\nIf you do not know what you want, go to the Internet and you will find it. People say that everything happens in your life for your benefit. You can always find the answer if you search on Google, it happened once and you will know how to do it now. You don\u2019t have to wait for the people to give themselves the answers.\nIn the face of the world, we do what we want and go where we like. But at the end of the day, at home, we need to do what we do for the sake of our family. The decisions we make at home, help us to grow up to be strong people. We cannot live on our own, we have to build our own families.\nThe good things we have today are due to the hard work we make today. We do not know what the future is because we still don\u2019t know what the future will bring to us. Whatever it happens, don\u2019t be afraid. We will be good people and have a good life because today, we are good people and we have a good life.","token_len":497,"entropy":[9.9962,6.0725,7.8425,3.6075,5.148,2.3906,4.3662,8.5376,9.5395,1.9623,0.003,2.4778,0.1517,3.3479,6.1978,1.7146,5.2344,10.8543,11.8648,1.1931,7.3854,1.0332,6.4088,1.3315,4.4743,9.0799,3.4805,4.3459,1.0594,4.8668,1.4402,4.9448,4.123,2.414,3.0061,7.6938,1.0853,1.9724,1.6295,10.2464,3.5282,0.8391,5.358,0.01,2.0751,0.4992,3.4763,1.8248,7.1613,2.149,5.6359,3.3892,0.2374,6.5899,0.8002,3.6404,1.0057,2.3698,7.1415,4.4442,0.08,5.6339,1.6523,3.6795,2.3078,4.7276,4.7706,6.7224,4.1721,3.6363,0.1641,3.0674,3.316,1.6515,9.4493,4.4001,0.5821,4.6446,5.4915,0.9891,0.9478,2.2498,1.1229,6.6296,2.453,4.5454,5.0027,3.2318,2.1794,4.5704,0.5554,6.6715,3.523,1.9213,1.3478,3.5519,1.328,3.5474,0.9556,1.2025,0.236,2.5249,7.7007,2.9167,1.8592,1.9104,2.4641,2.0364,4.4343,4.9327,2.4263,4.9624,0.1491,3.5802,5.1244,1.029,6.4743,5.5424,1.1873,4.2771,2.4871,0.8679,4.344,7.1501,4.5544,6.7923,2.5023,5.0045,2.0904,0.632,4.9732,5.1416,4.979,0.5835,0.485,1.606,2.5614,3.8038,4.3673,2.6204,2.126,4.6922,2.1293,0.48,0.916,1.4415,3.1683,1.9805,2.4234,4.1103,0.5726,3.7175,5.9282,2.7329,0.042,1.3664,0.9456,1.787,2.0256,4.5588,3.5875,1.4836,3.1035,2.5636,4.9143,1.5198,7.7241,0.6268,5.1648,4.9624,5.2692,1.9143,4.1956,0.588,4.7168,4.7547,0.6421,3.6571,3.0435,4.0014,5.9855,0.4024,3.2206,6.0631,2.8282,2.3647,2.6851,5.7543,4.6442,0.9998,1.4396,1.2072,1.1903,3.0655,4.2662,4.0433,0.9727,4.899,0.7573,2.5326,4.0936,1.8841,7.2044,0.9465,0.7893,1.2438,6.8246,1.1096,6.5712,2.9023,0.773,1.4518,5.3516,3.1671,1.5649,4.3382,0.2907,2.6886,1.1622,5.3489,1.9014,4.3584,2.6171,4.2527,2.4172,0.9078,5.4772,0.1381,5.242,3.8095,0.0144,1.8109,4.0971,0.9405,2.9643,2.7483,3.9784,4.4479,2.9589,1.5869,0.395,0.4694,7.1491,6.448,12.576,4.9307,3.8395,0.8405,2.6729,2.9008,1.1581,5.6565,4.8241,2.7596,2.7168,2.4647,0.6813,2.7924,1.1637,0.416,3.6313,0.4587,1.8332,4.8791,1.1627,7.7773,4.5676,0.1262,0.1465,0.9476,1.282,2.9352,0.5135,3.247,0.5561,3.2738,1.1462,0.9233,0.8051,0.3604,3.3177,2.5989,1.2203,6.7677,1.162,2.4231,0.2525,1.072,1.6296,0.5523,4.8439,3.3309,1.3037,4.2455,4.215,0.8733,3.7396,3.0452,5.4419,3.6845,3.275,0.9922,3.3467,2.0555,4.2581,3.0406,2.3528,3.004,3.788,0.1613,4.7378,3.5561,1.5538,2.1502,4.3232,8.5626,4.8201,2.7149,1.0552,1.6793,3.5017,3.4208,0.8357,2.7688,0.2279,3.2568,0.1741,3.2067,3.5399,15.8058,7.6017,0.2713,0.933,0.0783,2.3671,0.8646,1.7649,6.0117,1.3937,3.139,8.3318,2.1991,1.738,0.8767,0.8165,3.7652,1.6047,5.1357,0.0015,2.3209,3.2102,1.6434,2.248,3.4169,2.9298,0.3108,1.7751,2.2749,5.1339,1.008,0.1114,4.901,0.4705,3.4753,4.5414,0.2173,1.2745,0.3443,0.0497,0.008,0.2077,6.063,6.4964,0.7118,1.2292,4.3702,0.3946,2.736,0.9696,0.3719,3.1341,3.3743,1.3657,3.3476,0.0017,1.631,1.9954,1.4559,3.6417,6.4496,1.1241,0.0851,3.7506,0.7011,2.2374,7.9537,1.4186,1.7039,3.2626,3.5867,4.5284,0.7332,4.8518,2.937,0.9165,2.1682,4.0708,3.4113,3.0086,1.7597,0.2354,1.6066,0.8685,2.2837,0.2168,4.0536,1.3842,0.5701,5.8264,0.7075,0.8348,2.8069,4.9379,3.1112,2.9775,2.093,5.4087,0.5729,5.5171,0.1454,1.3425,2.9266,0.0341,1.6229,5.6839,4.2573,0.3942,1.708,2.8332,0.6146,3.4899,1.0524,2.7321,0.2842,2.7482,5.3843,0.8002,5.5519,2.6452,0.3417,0.1146,0.2308,0.2366,0.8119,1.8791,0.1977,0.9932,1.0062,3.7321,0.9809,0.343,6.8984,2.6707,5.0417,0.5967,6.5895,0.0568,0.2353,0.0053,2.5824,0.7018,1.5179,2.2787,1.6746,2.4414,4.1927,2.334,1.961,4.0327,1.5144,1.6743,0.4572,4.4242,6.6786,1.6451,0.8303,1.2323,2.0506,0.5955,2.0624,1.0558,1.8442,0.8727,0.2758,0.3724,0.4473]}
{"prompt":"You have a feeling that your history teacher may just be immortal .","text":"You have a feeling that your history teacher may just be immortal. A few years ago, an archaeologist found a skeleton in the ruins of Petra. The skeleton was very old, but its body was only covered with mud. The archaeologist also found a note written in cuneiform, which is the sacred writings of the ancient Sumerians. The note said, \" An inscription was discovered in the ruins of the palace at Petra. All the walls and the ceilings, including the wooden ceiling, were coated with red paint. The inscriptions were written by Herodotus and Xenophon. \"\nThe famous Greek philosopher Herodotus lived around 450 BC. He wrote a Greek history book called The Histories of the Kings of India in Asia Minor. His book is a historical source that we rely on. In that book, there is a special section, known as \"Early History\", which gives a detailed chronological account of ancient Sumerians'history. It describes the earliest history of the Sumerians.\nIn the book, Herodotus wrote that in the fourth century BC, \"the Sumerians were destroyed by the Medes and Babylonians. However, the Sumerians' language remains until today.\"\nIn the same book, Herodotus claimed that, in the tenth century BC, the ancestors of the Sumerians became extinct. From that time, \"Sanai people who migrated west began to build ancient Nineveh. It was called the Sumerian nation and became the largest nation of ancient Mesopotamia and the empire of ancient Mesopotamia. \"\nBut at that time, the ancestors of the Sumerians were very powerful in Sumeria and occupied many regions. This is why the Sumerians were destroyed.\nLater, Herodotus wrote a book about history. It did not mention the time the Sumerians disappeared. If the Sumerians were already extinct by that time, there was no need to write such things, right?\nOne of the most fascinating things about The Histories of the Kings of India is the description of the Babylonian conquest.\nHerodotus wrote: \"In the fourth century BC, Babylonians invaded Sumeria. They are the strongest nation of Sumerian. After conquering their stronghold, the Babylonians ruled the Sumerians for three hundred years. They then destroyed the city of Lagium, which was the largest city in the northern Sumerian empire.\"","token_len":497,"entropy":[3.7506,2.3294,5.5905,1.2799,3.5549,8.1153,5.2411,3.0247,5.4873,0.9786,11.4866,2.3053,5.2406,2.9728,1.0247,0.285,0.6699,4.4289,6.6791,0.0269,3.8442,0.9143,3.3853,2.0578,1.4793,4.1696,0.0467,7.5215,1.7482,2.0456,1.6064,0.928,4.5806,2.8419,0.7854,1.7863,4.1611,3.8501,0.5368,5.0558,5.3022,0.8671,4.3422,0.6908,1.7463,2.5695,0.009,4.7215,0.7743,1.0566,4.9824,2.9647,1.4979,7.0219,0.1256,0.0,1.4856,1.2747,2.5761,2.0706,6.7404,6.8002,0.1417,0.6275,2.1819,6.2251,0.0054,0.7101,0.3948,1.5176,0.9048,2.0974,1.6533,0.1168,10.054,5.1616,2.9979,3.2729,1.0298,0.7931,2.199,0.2222,2.0323,3.3719,3.7197,0.556,1.1582,5.768,1.3491,4.8787,1.7109,2.9531,4.1025,3.806,2.2626,0.2441,6.3293,3.5337,0.4848,0.8669,6.2135,0.1608,5.9469,2.9124,0.7416,1.2355,6.6055,0.0028,1.3117,1.5107,3.0301,6.125,0.2198,0.0004,2.0528,6.8831,0.0612,1.0561,3.6419,2.1796,4.7992,6.5817,3.857,2.6437,3.8811,0.0007,0.0018,5.2979,2.9999,4.8245,1.4359,1.1369,0.7661,1.4293,2.1079,6.2559,3.1646,4.3933,1.0113,1.9013,5.1523,0.1446,0.2272,1.1017,5.1343,0.8064,7.5947,4.0383,6.9527,0.0145,0.7246,3.3662,2.1778,2.0842,2.9897,3.8374,6.3033,2.5465,4.568,7.0682,0.2544,2.8125,2.9161,4.1245,0.1189,0.3508,3.5572,1.0795,0.6905,5.7959,2.676,3.9066,4.0487,0.044,2.1758,7.4906,0.6659,1.3089,1.5977,3.5136,1.6898,2.7805,4.9209,1.7344,0.0491,3.0185,4.7907,0.176,3.2587,3.7066,11.3193,0.375,2.7658,4.4283,0.9905,5.6359,2.7589,0.3644,0.8559,1.4246,0.0294,0.3564,1.156,1.9233,2.7828,1.3914,1.9344,0.3663,0.8359,0.0011,0.0006,3.4721,1.7392,3.7675,0.9928,4.3729,0.3084,0.5947,0.4539,3.5323,1.3217,2.9917,0.064,0.2191,1.6796,6.4546,0.708,0.8581,5.7196,0.0592,1.8494,3.9005,0.2113,1.435,5.5673,0.0637,1.6023,2.7794,0.0611,0.0984,4.8038,5.6496,4.862,9.5098,3.1624,1.7328,1.4411,1.9213,1.1387,4.1316,0.4974,0.2158,0.4463,0.0005,0.0009,6.182,0.2007,3.5507,1.7632,0.7152,4.4013,0.1078,0.2911,0.0591,1.061,7.6275,0.0402,0.3313,0.6772,0.0313,0.0488,4.231,2.8993,0.7488,6.2088,1.7897,1.1718,1.2809,4.3172,9.0811,6.9364,5.4921,4.3624,3.8007,3.8284,5.2466,0.3473,3.3232,6.423,13.1291,0.1091,2.9373,4.0138,0.8966,3.7876,1.5145,5.0193,0.0904,0.5908,6.2107,2.9136,3.2764,1.4361,2.8414,2.6327,1.6392,4.9085,2.469,0.0071,0.0503,3.1871,1.5014,5.5883,0.4892,4.4926,2.0765,0.0023,0.0068,1.0587,2.3488,0.2696,5.1665,5.5932,1.5819,0.074,0.1756,1.2129,5.8599,0.0826,0.1379,0.3859,0.0221,0.052,0.9124,4.1222,4.6674,3.9341,3.7576,3.1016,1.6779,6.4664,3.537,3.613,1.5957,3.5377,1.8687,1.142,1.5782,1.6249,0.033,0.1817,1.548,5.6051,1.3815,1.2114,5.2423,0.7813,2.0286,0.0009,0.0012,1.7081,2.5099,1.1914,2.9917,6.3176,2.3712,1.8114,6.8474,0.1899,1.3465,0.7964,6.636,4.136,1.1171,0.0268,0.0487,5.231,0.9162,5.7177,1.9191,1.4734,0.0299,0.0664,0.9912,5.4073,0.9474,4.0913,1.2901,0.0434,0.101,3.6598,1.6916,0.4953,1.0769,0.3793,3.213,3.9141,6.3498,3.7769,5.3213,0.0322,0.8295,5.4788,0.8466,0.2692,2.2892,4.5655,1.2008,0.3969,5.0086,1.3977,0.0003,0.0324,0.011,0.0135,0.0113,0.0681,0.36,1.6736,5.4725,0.2006,0.731,7.4575,0.5877,4.4531,1.7356,1.7792,7.8399,0.0262,0.0043,0.0029,1.2995,2.7437,1.0671,2.5138,0.5669,2.7114,0.1204,0.1068,0.2236,3.6978,1.7729,1.5952,3.2766,1.9405,1.2019,1.4981,5.8692,2.2761,4.2406,3.2422,1.3612,2.9728,1.1656,0.5341,3.6085,4.4605,2.3274,4.0594,8.2164,0.8343,1.8245,1.4443,0.0906,6.3792,1.7398,4.936,0.0733,1.485,1.9068,3.1006,2.1561,0.1517,0.3979,2.0601,4.0072,4.0877,0.773,1.9149,0.3555,9.4476,6.2627,1.5485,1.5374,1.0095,2.4991,3.3576,0.3441,0.7402,0.5946,5.8602,3.4167,0.0787,0.1322,2.5186,2.2224]}

The fact that, air quality affects the economy of a nation as well. Dust is created for several reasons and at different level. The dust or soil particles are created naturally through the action of wind, weather and weather condition. Dust can be harmful if particles get accumulated in our lungs or eyes. The following article will reveal to you the most common reasons for dust storms.\nDust or pollutants spread in the air in different ways. It can spread over large regions at the same time.\nMost countries experience a lot rain during winter or monsoon season. However, the rain does not kill the dust to a great extent. The wind blows the grains from one region to another region.\nDust storms are a common occurrence in areas where there is no proper drainage. Dust or pollutants spread easily in areas which have poor drainage and they can easily get accumulated.\nIf the plants grow near a residential area which is prone to air pollution, the dust from the plants can easily get into the air to pollute it.\nShadows produced by the trees are created as a shield to protect the leaves from the sun rays. Trees emit tiny particles from their leaves and these can be harmful to our health.\nWhen you are looking for ways to get rid of the air pollution, look no further, this is the best product to use.

The world is informed that in two weeks everybody over the age of ten will have their conscience transferred to another random human body anywhere in the world. This shuffle will then repeat every 24 hours. The only person who has any say in this decision is the person you put as your conscience and they are instructed by the entity to transfer your consciousness to one of the chosen bodies at the designated time. The only way to stop that happening is by shooting the entity or another person from the new body you select (which is random at the designated time) and hope to survive the transfer. You can choose what the new body will be of (white girl, black man, white boy, black girl, or random) your conscience. The only exception is to your conscience being transferred into a random body if you are over 60 years old and you have chosen to receive your conscience into one of the white bodies.\nYou are also informed that you are a victim of a test and in order to win it you need to find out how the test is done and survive it. (The test is to see if you can accept the transfer in a new body or to save one of the chosen bodies, which could mean shooting another person or yourself, or your consciousness leaving your body and getting transferred into a random body you don't have a say in )\nWhen you reach this point, the person you have chosen as your conscience as well as your main target in your body will appear on-screen, it is up to you whether or not you wish to kill them. If you kill them they will simply give you another random number from one of the other chosen bodies and a new number will be generated.\nI don't like to explain the logic behind this game but I wanted to point out if you are already playing any type of survival or tactical survival game you probably have more in common with this game than you may think.\nFor those who would rather not play the game I have uploaded the files to Vuze here are all of the folders so you can download them to your local machine.\nThis is a survival MMO sandbox game in which you make your own rules. One interesting thing is that there are five different factions that will play the game and can be switched between games. You can make any kind of rules you desire, be it you only kill certain persons or you kill all the members of a family or whatever.","token_len":498,"entropy":[10.7193,5.4853,8.6329,0.1737,4.718,4.8948,2.1973,6.69,0.2816,3.8948,2.522,7.162,0.7487,2.2178,4.2224,0.9448,8.5561,1.74,5.5418,6.8878,2.5068,8.8393,7.7436,1.4551,0.0458,0.0107,3.3523,0.3599,2.5522,2.1578,8.4732,7.5222,0.368,4.1574,8.7173,3.4771,3.9871,11.0032,0.7357,0.0558,0.8914,0.419,2.9312,12.9436,2.3985,5.6156,5.2916,3.8102,5.339,0.1296,1.3265,1.9664,3.8786,3.1123,0.8594,3.1336,3.333,4.764,0.4378,0.8489,3.6635,0.2964,0.8275,4.3903,4.2065,5.6969,6.5028,0.8171,4.2416,3.4359,4.5366,2.407,6.4826,3.0412,0.9229,3.1598,0.4832,5.537,2.2747,4.1174,0.5891,4.8563,0.3512,1.151,4.4602,2.5819,3.867,1.6291,5.4194,0.2758,0.3906,1.8006,3.3882,2.568,0.5637,2.652,4.5832,3.0622,0.0906,2.386,7.3019,1.6926,1.4648,4.5662,5.8064,2.5238,4.4407,1.1578,6.6642,0.2331,2.6833,4.9376,4.5909,3.7961,1.2692,6.5892,3.7794,1.6666,4.37,0.0453,2.1265,0.8897,6.2656,2.6461,4.881,1.917,3.7452,0.6673,3.7473,1.6475,2.8886,4.984,4.1023,3.6939,0.1401,1.4978,0.8556,5.444,4.8786,5.9878,8.1008,1.0738,1.7315,4.8245,0.2841,2.6645,1.7139,0.4121,2.2837,0.7158,0.4022,2.81,7.4558,2.6644,6.0311,1.6879,4.3964,2.0021,2.8254,4.1011,0.663,4.1211,5.8778,1.7786,3.3543,1.7499,4.6186,1.4146,2.1614,1.3866,3.7,0.6391,1.8572,4.7471,5.2641,0.8654,0.1714,1.7261,1.518,2.088,3.7553,0.8883,5.9426,1.5982,1.0959,5.2277,3.3558,0.1867,0.286,7.0053,3.4918,1.0216,2.4089,7.0147,2.4124,4.0105,4.6528,0.4392,2.1313,1.6341,3.8332,5.2069,0.2337,1.2994,7.2275,3.1116,5.2393,1.6463,0.0696,5.6563,3.9452,0.5341,3.0292,0.1831,5.0435,1.0081,2.3359,2.387,0.5314,2.5032,2.0361,1.6419,6.8874,1.4017,0.4481,5.7757,2.9917,0.7233,0.9732,3.7182,3.1263,0.3254,0.4079,1.052,6.3678,1.0904,4.1731,4.2473,2.2432,4.6701,0.1177,2.5171,3.8196,5.4873,3.8979,0.6454,0.8308,2.6906,0.2849,3.4649,2.2159,5.3196,2.7233,7.7619,3.9153,0.3231,2.3016,5.8554,2.5913,1.5865,5.131,5.5539,6.1282,2.1066,0.6357,2.3247,4.1901,3.0649,1.2832,1.4928,0.5301,0.1834,3.77,4.7286,0.001,2.7817,2.993,5.7152,0.0521,8.0132,1.372,4.5747,0.6836,4.1033,3.9872,0.2171,1.2025,1.6405,3.5761,0.6558,3.221,0.4571,1.9604,0.135,0.0594,7.308,1.0946,0.0223,1.2051,6.6035,5.5157,4.5285,2.542,4.7075,0.9974,4.3468,2.6682,7.0944,0.0311,2.4724,5.2582,2.2156,3.3862,0.0081,0.054,2.9746,0.9012,0.0017,0.623,3.5364,0.0723,3.493,0.9107,1.0638,2.2958,0.2979,1.81,0.6124,3.8271,0.2718,5.4751,4.62,0.462,3.7977,4.7796,6.8664,3.1048,4.2784,0.1821,0.6392,3.208,3.3774,0.1,1.876,4.4668,2.3845,3.06,3.2688,0.9818,3.4539,1.3014,2.0152,5.2858,3.5702,0.0017,4.1239,1.8332,4.2365,2.2157,4.6141,1.2157,1.0236,3.7572,2.6834,1.6556,3.5588,0.0836,4.0452,0.1791,6.7509,1.1096,1.842,4.6041,2.8297,5.8133,4.4852,0.0097,4.2061,4.1073,6.1338,2.7854,0.5473,1.7148,3.4707,2.5577,4.4976,5.06,0.1373,0.0383,3.6522,0.9588,0.4093,1.4134,4.7574,1.1201,0.2152,1.8449,4.6303,1.9779,1.1375,4.337,3.0076,1.6974,2.1327,1.7118,0.3927,2.316,2.5954,6.1769,2.0535,5.1182,1.8224,12.9212,3.8534,4.9587,5.8787,4.2545,1.6967,0.5412,6.8933,5.6432,0.6206,0.3249,2.3602,0.7148,3.2144,0.7302,4.9392,3.0632,1.1514,0.8638,3.6236,1.312,1.4836,3.3837,7.981,7.7673,0.9029,3.6273,0.5128,0.495,5.8219,0.5439,0.8326,3.9507,2.2234,5.54,8.0048,0.848,1.7038,0.3988,2.9069,0.7248,5.2753,1.4666,2.5694,2.2447,3.4392,2.9564,2.0788,0.1224,2.1575,5.4402,1.4644,4.25,1.1442,7.1139,1.5228,2.4649,0.8834,4.0339,3.1387,3.6071,0.0032,3.6829,1.1805,5.0947,1.7768,5.7225,0.2021,4.5574,6.3686,4.8601,3.8108,6.3925,1.2895,1.6149,3.6081,1.5492,1.8952,4.6007,0.3063,2.0004,5.4893,2.4207,4.4167,0.7917]}

Some deaf people grow up in their own house and can have a communication method so that they can talk to the people who are around them and they can explain them what they say.","token_len":500,"entropy":[5.3684,3.8334,7.4639,1.7848,8.0779,5.792,6.046,1.5031,2.9758,0.1139,2.5069,2.6123,11.0072,0.4519,2.1461,3.6418,5.5279,0.8337,1.7441,1.3507,3.4575,0.0005,0.9434,1.748,0.6331,0.3501,0.061,0.0863,2.2281,8.7098,6.19,4.4294,8.3623,1.8027,1.2047,1.7152,1.8881,1.0345,2.6807,0.6567,4.3472,1.8851,0.4795,0.7925,15.845,2.6704,7.7783,5.4382,0.8686,3.4161,2.6189,2.3181,6.1964,2.3346,3.8583,5.2831,1.0892,1.3505,2.1522,0.9357,0.7708,5.3141,0.1602,2.3505,1.591,3.6945,3.6384,3.4416,0.7215,2.1513,0.5765,0.9144,2.7341,0.833,0.3325,0.3499,0.7231,4.728,0.7908,1.5425,2.548,1.184,1.72,4.3595,0.9427,4.5742,2.3054,0.0005,1.9346,0.8599,3.8524,3.9362,5.8457,2.8965,2.9849,2.7682,1.5271,1.075,2.1273,0.4651,2.1991,1.7156,1.1741,3.6734,1.7169,2.2684,6.5583,7.8995,0.268,4.921,2.2976,4.3255,0.2885,3.8892,0.9197,0.9493,0.0056,6.6811,0.7282,0.3467,0.001,5.728,0.919,0.1996,0.0016,4.6676,1.0118,5.0036,4.214,0.0535,4.8321,7.7721,5.0953,0.0092,7.3974,3.4876,3.2053,1.1836,0.0035,7.3262,5.3892,3.174,0.9323,3.0961,2.308,0.0098,4.0801,1.6436,4.0557,0.5135,1.5724,4.3731,0.2672,0.7175,5.4273,7.0602,2.5555,3.4579,0.5636,3.3026,1.7382,5.0844,5.3093,1.2398,1.5636,4.8692,0.3241,2.4675,2.3746,3.824,4.0039,1.6797,1.3622,0.9778,0.9135,0.683,5.5938,1.3399,4.1901,0.5992,4.3554,8.2608,4.0881,1.6348,0.4329,3.3114,0.2054,2.5136,2.7849,7.4471,0.515,1.4469,2.6742,2.4496,5.4258,5.1643,2.0887,5.2042,1.4578,0.7994,1.0988,2.9162,0.0127,1.9322,3.6667,2.5214,0.7168,6.4857,5.3072,1.6114,3.4638,0.807,3.8931,2.6063,1.1753,1.1152,5.1871,4.8044,3.2536,4.1442,3.0707,1.3194,1.3214,0.7387,1.4361,4.1024,5.7236,0.356,2.3578,0.5418,1.8472,2.3282,4.0702,0.9544,0.0022,2.391,0.3888,1.9776,4.0468,0.4168,1.1607,1.7651,2.0007,0.0145,0.514,0.3741,0.6149,4.2183,1.4954,0.2728,2.0599,2.9649,6.2591,2.1901,5.5676,2.73,2.4088,2.7985,3.6423,2.8968,7.8027,0.0821,2.1373,3.1833,0.0497,0.407,5.0867,2.8088,0.2093,3.0523,0.3909,0.2285,5.732,2.9087,4.1173,1.3721,4.9001,7.4994,1.6463,0.5185,1.195,3.0808,0.0136,0.6708,4.3009,4.0522,5.7261,5.8646,5.9022,0.2402,1.3734,0.8091,1.6585,4.7913,2.2394,2.0434,6.3383,0.8233,1.4286,0.1593,1.5074,2.0213,2.6144,5.0062,0.0546,0.4433,1.0086,3.8727,1.7839,0.0665,3.8114,0.4985,4.3051,2.7314,0.029,2.9139,1.8145,6.4597,5.4075,4.0276,0.9299,2.5683,3.5887,6.9619,2.172,0.0027,2.039,10.1699,0.0235,0.6611,0.88,2.5945,0.0029,0.3172,4.8267,3.9369,4.3377,5.0832,4.1637,9.0835,0.8943,5.2289,0.5348,1.2224,7.6107,4.5582,3.7624,3.2787,1.2072,1.5661,0.1011,0.4647,3.9073,0.0035,0.129,2.6238,2.5732,5.7653,2.4551,2.0852,1.3748,1.737,5.2282,0.622,2.537,4.4501,2.5857,2.7086,3.1355,0.1914,2.7585,2.8464,2.6655,8.3629,0.3166,2.8664,2.2785,6.4792,2.6878,4.1391,1.5776,3.9138,2.9242,5.4463,1.183,0.6164,1.145,2.3595,0.0025,0.1844,2.3189,2.3355,4.0237,4.2328,3.034,1.7816,1.3831,1.3942,2.4108,1.1131,2.2559,2.2311,6.0567,4.7701,4.5561,4.7435,4.2372,0.2698,4.0309,4.7452,3.5753,0.8101,4.8989,1.4218,3.5391,0.2982,1.0163,2.1599,0.002,0.1156,3.6006,0.9635,2.4738,2.4156,1.5059,3.2833,4.4752,0.7896,3.2993,0.4281,3.0563,1.3557,1.0268,1.5757,1.7071,5.6932,0.5099,1.8085,0.8144,0.1441,0.2749,1.3774,1.5404,3.3162,2.0369,1.1682,0.751,2.6441,3.6148,4.8339,1.0466,4.8398,0.8012,0.105,1.785,4.6057,4.2092,2.0725,1.4392,2.0774,1.2759,3.5641,1.3234,3.1361,0.5044,0.0415,6.4589,0.2226,1.0413,5.2896,0.786,4.3159,1.4254,3.9334,3.6528,1.7352,8.7978,6.1942,5.1526,1.1097,0.6319,0.3903,3.2404,0.6531,3.1181,2.2989,1.6281,1.5733,3.461,0.056,2.5793,3.2921,0.3225,6.7528,4.8895,4.4493,0.8133,4.2181,0.4978]}

{"prompt":"You develop reality warping powers .","text":"You develop reality warping powers. When you fight you can't see anything. How can you defeat a monster without an image of it?\nI do not know, but if you did you would be able to understand reality and predict what's coming, that is, use these powers.\nYou use the powers only when you need them in your fight, because you don't see what is close to you.\nAt that time the game is different from what we have now. I think that it should be added to the game something similar to the vision enhancers that give to other players. I could never think it, but the more information you have in a game the wider your choice and the more freedom. For me that's one of the best aspects of a game.\nThe game can also tell the player that everything you see through the vision enhancers is not true. It is really not possible yet to know how a player should use vision enhancers, for example, so many advantages can become disadvantages.\nThe player will see the scene from different points of view, because for this action the player has to use more than one camera to cover all the areas of the level. The player will see an image from an elevated place.\nIt's very important not just to see through the telescope. You have a special type of telescope, called a panoramic telescope, you can extend it to a wide area, you can see everything through it without distortion, it also has a wider field of view.\nWith the panoramic telescope, it allows you to see the place that you want. In my case, with the help of my telescope I have seen a lot of different things, such as a mountain or an unknown mountain where all of the players were hidden. They saw us and attacked us. I can almost say, thanks to the panoramic telescope, I had a completely different view of the situation. It was very good in the game.\nIt is because we wanted to create a game with some kind of realistic presentation of the battle, where you can see different weapons and weapons that we will use in the battle. Of course by this we wanted to make the game more realistic.\nIn general, the battlefield in a MMO is divided into many squares, each of which corresponds to a tile on the screen. They are small squares with special markers. Usually, they are represented by numbers. What do they mean? Here they will have special functions.","token_len":501,"entropy":[8.9132,10.398,9.0595,2.9997,6.3661,2.2596,4.5826,1.3251,5.9413,4.5271,2.6164,2.5835,4.4747,3.2557,1.2087,5.7766,1.5661,0.3344,5.3144,1.7329,4.2068,3.1772,5.059,5.647,0.9906,2.1206,0.9441,2.3111,7.282,4.9335,1.4004,1.5949,3.2346,0.855,3.2694,1.006,5.0067,2.4449,0.5937,1.7331,2.7904,0.0083,3.8746,5.6668,3.4699,7.1189,1.6462,3.8461,1.879,2.7463,4.8304,1.9776,3.5712,7.6706,4.4613,0.7872,1.6281,1.4671,2.6446,4.3885,2.2034,2.3128,6.6396,1.7452,0.5962,3.019,0.3611,5.1003,2.2329,3.1038,2.2111,3.9224,1.4692,2.7563,0.0009,4.4025,1.9905,1.9095,8.4308,1.0962,0.9223,0.5398,1.0168,5.8545,2.0591,1.3904,3.2809,5.2475,1.7544,5.6131,1.8493,2.8992,2.545,2.2167,0.8802,0.6138,3.7841,1.9548,1.9141,2.88,4.4586,0.4986,6.094,1.1302,0.6001,0.7279,9.0883,3.8094,0.6043,1.5821,8.8545,11.7039,0.9075,2.4029,5.2522,6.0806,4.0162,2.5959,0.7699,3.1876,5.4792,4.7914,3.3707,4.7734,5.354,0.6515,3.2633,5.2116,4.469,1.0893,1.282,2.9514,3.259,0.5726,1.2393,8.1374,1.4163,6.343,3.9733,0.7322,0.4271,6.3517,4.6547,5.3509,2.0374,2.5862,1.3964,4.14,0.3468,0.0905,2.6874,2.8213,0.3807,3.3089,0.3296,0.6536,0.6937,2.707,2.0292,4.1322,3.3377,4.6031,2.9305,2.6529,3.1582,5.2208,3.2956,1.901,5.782,0.8879,4.8737,0.3516,0.4808,0.5969,3.0041,3.2047,0.7301,2.7225,2.1238,5.0535,3.5629,2.9493,7.222,0.8351,2.5796,2.7186,3.6223,1.8307,5.2163,3.103,4.4748,0.1323,0.0401,2.0291,4.2308,0.4223,1.4145,4.2814,5.067,9.0678,2.7772,5.8709,6.734,1.0136,0.8384,2.4344,3.7436,3.0439,3.2854,2.3132,7.0115,2.4344,2.8659,2.7164,0.7527,0.0379,1.1648,4.1071,5.5434,3.9751,7.7827,2.1463,0.8361,2.2056,0.8704,3.2641,5.1811,2.0174,0.6942,5.1997,2.7465,5.9026,2.0954,0.8879,3.6651,1.8804,0.6409,5.3326,0.3455,2.79,1.2845,1.7604,1.8625,4.8414,2.2428,2.2919,4.7285,6.7171,3.3782,2.3199,1.3639,3.1528,1.6009,2.934,1.6048,3.9741,3.9512,0.754,2.5975,4.5019,0.7604,8.8179,3.255,2.233,1.9835,4.1847,4.7937,4.8567,0.0292,3.4503,1.8124,3.0808,0.5449,5.7311,0.4276,0.004,2.1516,0.9489,3.73,0.8806,8.1079,0.9973,1.6149,2.383,3.485,1.7238,1.7883,2.4507,0.1805,1.1375,3.7978,3.4429,1.083,4.8632,5.8912,1.617,2.4359,4.5251,1.8914,1.1575,5.9086,1.653,0.1637,0.0142,0.7153,0.8326,5.1317,1.1852,3.4356,0.0051,0.0207,0.5209,1.555,2.896,3.2829,0.5373,0.0443,0.6748,1.9318,6.2768,2.7585,0.9652,1.399,3.5203,3.6142,3.1599,1.599,1.1571,5.2076,0.6557,7.037,0.0102,2.1936,4.3719,1.1279,3.009,1.937,2.1469,1.6355,0.1018,3.0433,2.0561,1.7026,3.8592,0.0082,2.1343,4.0147,2.7412,2.6375,5.5362,3.0293,6.0961,4.4325,2.3779,0.704,4.5746,3.8866,5.7435,0.8586,5.2647,4.4203,6.1954,2.312,7.4286,0.3052,0.8002,2.706,2.6929,6.4824,3.3263,2.7593,7.3913,0.0348,1.0973,1.9288,0.0032,0.0017,0.2275,0.4592,1.3647,3.986,1.6637,5.5999,0.3401,1.5322,1.112,0.8692,3.0947,0.6659,3.1697,1.4103,2.0737,3.6484,4.1283,2.0484,2.7076,0.8249,0.3678,3.1588,1.6547,5.2389,3.5637,6.4051,0.3648,3.0082,0.8096,2.332,2.3083,5.1533,3.012,0.0008,4.5817,7.4232,2.6858,0.8094,5.8739,2.0851,3.1646,1.4811,1.3409,0.7881,4.1681,5.9172,1.1185,3.9606,2.6827,3.4678,4.5707,1.831,1.2877,0.6788,3.1308,0.5334,6.2505,0.0124,7.3153,3.6731,1.8711,4.2872,0.3153,1.6453,1.1175,1.1059,1.8949,0.5461,1.2491,0.7237,3.1594,5.18,1.0232,1.907,6.9848,3.5734,2.1882,7.4127,0.5215,5.1611,0.1722,4.0311,6.486,1.0441,2.3867,1.9435,0.6539,5.6324,0.1327,0.818,7.3654,2.8152,0.3943,2.1706,0.3726,5.079,0.8294,5.6941,1.5326,2.4646,6.1981,6.4869,1.7613,6.0154,1.9417,2.7562,0.6431,5.9496,0.4478,4.9078,1.6504,5.5497,3.8123,1.994,1.1488,0.5048,6.323,2.96,4.9035,3.6581,2.5016,6.7884,1.2133]}

Humankind , once excited by the prospect of rapid advancement aided by the aliens , now finds its lower classes almost completely out of work and highly disilussioned .","text":"Aliens have come to Earth. They have no interest in anything beyond holding menial jobs, which they complete very efficiently. Humankind, once excited by the prospect of rapid advancement aided by the aliens, now finds its lower classes almost completely out of work and highly disilussioned. They are now willing to work almost any job given. They have been assimilated into humanity as the aliens have no inclination to leave the Earth. Humanity has become a species of aliens.\nThis world -in -a -book was written in the era of the 1960s. I was a teenager in 1969 and thus my memories of this era probably are influenced to some degree by things that occurred in 1968, the year my father died. It is possible this is somewhat biased and therefore a little different than what others may remember.\nThe cover above was taken from the 1960 edition published by Harper and Brothers. The new edition in 2016 has a hard cover cover.\nI was introduced to these writings by my daughter while attending some courses given by her on the web. I have posted the link below.\nIn the second paragraph it mentions, \" They had invented nuclear power that they could use to generate energy, without burning any fuel and their technology was very close to ours.\"\nThe only point I can see that these statements do not hold truth for today is the phrase, nuclear power that they could use to generate energy. Since then the usage of nuclear power has increased to such alarming levels that it seems it would have killed the aliens.\nI don't think an explanation would be necessary. In a parallel universe the aliens might not have discovered nuclear power and thus possibly not be limited by it. However it seems a little unlikely that they would have been such a stupid race that they would have ignored the potential dangers of these advancements.\nIt is much more likely that the use of nuclear power would have been limited to military operations and to control nuclear weapons to reduce the possibility of a third world war. There is nothing in the book to suggest a use of power for anything beyond that. If this actually did happen it would have created enormous problems both economically and socially, but I don't think anyone from the aliens would recognize such things today.\nA few years ago my daughter gave me a copy of the 1960 edition of this book. I read it for that reason and found it interesting. As I see it this book is quite well written and if taken at face value it does seem to hold some truth.","token_len":502,"entropy":[9.9962,6.0725,5.3461,1.062,4.8031,2.4898,2.2141,1.7404,4.4646,5.6122,0.0581,5.3662,4.3439,7.9884,8.7594,5.1783,0.3169,1.8794,3.7977,1.7753,8.9732,6.4496,4.1962,0.8271,9.404,0.0517,3.1012,5.2883,8.3887,0.7151,1.1382,1.5229,0.0593,7.3736,4.1487,11.1512,0.232,1.6383,10.2453,0.549,3.2774,2.4361,3.2331,9.7144,4.0206,5.8715,3.6164,3.8074,0.2571,0.6205,2.3209,7.3186,5.9148,11.9008,12.2962,4.4627,0.5184,3.244,1.4478,3.0629,5.5011,0.1051,3.1416,5.0421,3.4827,1.2589,7.2542,3.7172,2.0957,2.0836,3.2646,7.0515,0.1188,0.7669,5.7108,3.489,3.2967,3.2357,1.4809,6.392,6.1493,0.4316,3.3115,2.9944,2.3627,0.7346,4.8888,1.5392,2.3992,1.7503,4.4171,0.6319,4.6156,1.5531,2.1491,6.3954,5.283,7.0385,8.5915,8.6696,3.0831,1.7445,6.7199,6.0569,2.2665,2.0094,1.6959,5.6536,0.385,1.3312,6.8476,0.3045,1.2638,4.1321,3.1538,2.552,3.4825,2.2112,4.1714,2.3999,7.687,4.2962,4.3881,0.6138,2.5094,4.809,6.5002,2.8711,6.5338,5.3022,1.1397,0.6023,0.1125,4.6876,1.5513,2.7428,1.1156,5.136,2.4095,3.7404,1.889,4.3073,2.4556,2.0188,0.5336,3.1614,1.3228,3.0085,4.815,2.2885,7.0231,5.6246,3.2023,4.3323,3.8905,1.9707,4.3068,2.0061,1.9476,5.7355,2.8733,3.1723,0.8055,1.7557,2.1859,7.0882,5.9532,2.3295,2.4192,0.2581,1.439,4.713,4.7001,6.2249,0.2375,4.0275,4.0326,2.7138,0.9271,1.8504,6.5445,1.5632,4.8589,7.4455,2.3388,1.6105,6.6265,0.9576,4.9632,2.1422,1.3928,2.5523,2.7004,4.357,0.141,3.8641,7.9757,1.1954,2.5554,4.9931,4.8681,2.8257,5.9095,6.3105,7.3868,0.538,3.4461,5.1988,1.3375,7.0196,1.1128,1.4808,2.6716,6.4754,2.5255,4.2876,1.7578,1.8226,0.8788,3.6598,1.7942,5.5709,3.3545,4.6691,4.1996,4.7458,0.9648,8.7965,4.1249,6.3864,6.3316,3.0822,4.7566,3.0683,1.5806,2.1934,0.561,4.12,2.4587,2.79,4.8713,4.0307,2.3125,1.164,3.467,5.312,3.5302,1.0201,3.4631,5.0901,0.0609,3.4731,1.6738,1.3229,2.0125,5.5732,5.6591,1.493,1.6736,3.3824,2.6915,5.2052,4.9752,3.9606,0.2633,4.3744,6.3098,3.7855,4.8845,0.5309,1.6515,5.6461,1.9756,6.276,0.5832,3.4174,0.4564,0.5651,0.2167,0.0534,0.0196,0.0438,2.1686,5.7433,3.9146,2.5328,7.062,0.2099,1.0652,0.9422,0.314,2.1831,3.5653,3.3848,6.6991,0.9148,0.1646,1.8537,3.605,4.4583,2.399,2.6993,6.097,2.6256,4.7319,1.7706,1.1672,2.2109,4.0105,0.0017,1.6608,6.5091,4.7447,2.9443,0.3653,3.5302,2.047,3.6162,3.2995,6.1744,0.9929,2.5506,1.7408,3.5667,2.7953,0.5852,5.46,1.8579,0.2046,2.3157,4.3871,6.2553,2.9605,3.4032,9.7731,1.8834,1.438,0.5027,2.9962,3.2995,1.869,4.0573,3.1601,4.0114,0.3452,1.1637,0.499,0.5333,2.4337,6.3757,0.3786,4.6733,5.6472,2.3341,0.534,0.3786,0.5076,6.1918,1.5003,4.829,2.1289,1.0979,5.4865,7.4984,0.5559,0.769,3.5757,1.0242,5.7811,0.8206,0.3019,0.2034,1.4647,5.7227,0.0089,0.3182,0.3658,1.255,0.2299,1.6784,3.226,0.8893,5.6345,4.0,2.0706,3.6952,6.7422,5.2898,1.5798,4.3866,4.5928,0.9401,4.7843,0.1553,2.1273,5.6193,0.5653,0.0679,0.3493,4.3991,0.8459,3.3837,1.7588,0.7387,2.22,2.0947,0.695,3.5371,5.6176,0.492,6.2958,2.4494,3.9391,3.3483,2.9337,0.8923,4.1873,2.9529,7.0128,3.2002,0.5756,1.9891,0.4083,1.6202,4.3439,4.6029,1.495,5.8455,3.6653,0.1166,2.8744,2.9943,2.5164,2.2013,1.8536,0.0008,0.4024,3.4846,6.3189,0.8631,2.8072,0.5659,7.7494,3.8365,4.1974,5.4798,0.3194,0.5319,4.2795,2.2332,1.5884,0.4849,3.6215,1.7394,4.2975,0.5429,0.7591,1.9657,0.0395,1.1781,6.9898,0.6591,0.5628,3.0715,0.1951,0.6783,1.7327,3.2885,0.6509,3.6464,7.8538,1.2261,1.4299,3.8576,0.6698,2.573,0.459,4.5685,1.4002,6.3986,0.1714,3.473,1.0491,0.9802,4.3812,4.1889,0.8171,0.8594,5.1003,6.2686,2.2421,0.1008,0.0013,0.7119,4.0877,3.3789,0.7532,4.4102,1.6054,0.9471,0.9935]}
{"prompt":"The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User","text":"The Secret Life of a Casul Meth User (The New Yorker, 2011) by David Grann.\nI wasn\u2019t aware of these books when I was in High School, and I never thought about reading them. I\u2019ll let you know what I think after I finish them.\nIn the future, I will post a link to each of the books\u2019 website here. So far, none of these books are available where I live.\nDo you have any tips for reading these books? Do you have any recommendations for reading other books of this kind? Let me know below!\nThere is much more that i wanted to say, but I don't even want to think about what may happen to me if I write it down. That's not my nature.\nNo matter how much i think about it, I cannot get any answer, so we won't argue it, as i don't want to cause troubles between us.\nDon't you have any other way to explain it? Like the one that i know of? I know nothing about the law.\nI can't explain it that way, so i was only saying i don't think it right. But, I am sorry for your bad feelings.\nDon't worry, i just read the story out my mouth with a little bit of exaggeration, so that i could make sure you understand it well.\nYou mean that because of the money you've spent for the medical care you received during this period?\nYes, but you could have gotten a better one by that time. It isn't easy to find a good one nowadays. You know how much doctors have to take to work in these days.\nYeah, I know, they are not at all good doctors. The reason for me wanting to go to a private clinic is because if you find such a good one, everything will be charged differently.\nWhat if there isn't one, so you have to use these clinic? That would be even worse than using the clinics in my village.\nBut if you use the clinics in my village, you can get some cheap medications as well, which are even more important than taking some pain killers. Those cheap ones help in the beginning only, but then you'll have to go through even a more painful process of cure.\nHow much the pain killers cost in the clinics in my village? I don't think they will charge as much as they charge in the clinics you have gone to.","token_len":504,"entropy":[9.391,3.2017,0.1379,4.3311,10.2232,8.7846,14.9629,10.7053,2.9253,4.5623,5.2859,1.1684,0.9048,4.6933,0.6403,5.7468,3.6719,5.926,2.7203,3.3746,1.0636,8.3839,6.2135,16.1427,7.9317,0.8434,3.5897,0.7198,4.3361,3.0931,2.9439,0.1912,1.4615,2.9998,6.3504,0.3353,1.2091,1.8827,1.093,2.7745,3.174,1.9616,5.066,0.4449,1.475,1.3092,10.4689,0.4654,6.8023,6.5304,0.7053,1.5658,3.8015,0.7773,1.7755,6.328,1.7615,2.5683,3.7207,0.543,1.6037,3.6795,1.681,5.7443,0.3575,1.0678,1.5272,4.3995,1.5274,3.644,0.231,3.2414,1.2699,1.1929,1.2147,3.7649,0.6454,10.1474,4.1535,1.0298,5.327,3.8951,0.5267,5.7694,0.3583,2.013,1.0077,2.1538,2.624,8.3119,0.6787,1.4419,0.8319,1.5194,5.3805,0.3279,1.3102,0.6651,3.6437,0.8073,4.1599,1.5669,0.2774,0.4183,3.5194,0.1527,1.1595,0.6253,3.6924,0.5645,2.8308,3.9607,1.2001,4.6305,2.0714,1.8657,0.3694,2.3984,0.2069,0.0055,3.3139,1.6942,0.8419,5.6061,1.6064,4.0123,0.8822,3.2816,6.7336,5.6814,0.0469,0.8895,2.1842,0.9331,1.5407,3.0445,0.6583,4.9843,2.3344,0.0468,5.0833,0.1827,3.6035,5.9601,2.463,1.5652,1.801,1.6641,0.7469,4.3688,4.9288,0.7425,0.5883,4.9623,1.9046,2.5856,2.7835,5.5212,0.7267,1.4565,6.0204,1.6065,0.9491,1.2988,1.8403,3.2086,0.4375,1.0888,0.2676,1.4054,4.3297,4.2884,3.944,5.5412,3.8953,2.4694,5.7159,3.8648,0.0494,7.7965,4.2047,2.9082,4.1892,2.462,2.6288,0.1305,1.1541,0.4124,4.7958,8.2953,6.6056,1.9813,0.4597,0.7681,5.5548,0.3447,3.7291,2.8577,0.3329,2.5808,6.3111,0.7373,3.6268,2.9079,0.4965,5.9895,3.7841,4.0162,2.7486,2.6307,6.2615,1.646,1.497,2.5414,2.9913,5.439,0.4511,3.4323,5.7814,2.1243,1.0949,1.9401,3.5157,1.1997,2.7909,1.1778,5.4093,0.2744,1.1396,1.7976,1.7366,6.32,5.5665,5.1715,4.6014,2.0771,0.0807,2.5271,1.7396,7.0214,0.9779,3.3209,2.6492,2.4342,3.2125,3.7144,2.148,3.4529,5.9812,2.8226,0.9556,0.8559,4.4543,0.0884,2.0783,0.766,1.4845,4.3524,4.4512,1.8908,4.6062,5.8648,9.5123,2.2797,5.1692,2.2247,3.4797,1.5424,0.084,7.1144,2.0591,1.5701,2.7413,2.0718,3.2399,3.3758,3.4304,2.24,1.2318,1.7936,3.9473,0.3183,0.5041,3.5658,4.9142,2.027,4.7496,2.3922,1.4476,6.3309,1.867,3.9209,1.8587,3.9673,1.6872,9.0996,2.1694,1.6174,1.9412,4.1895,3.1344,3.093,1.1053,0.8596,2.5529,0.4597,2.3573,2.7155,4.4068,3.1133,3.8673,2.4787,2.2593,3.7239,3.958,5.4278,0.4128,0.5396,3.8368,4.773,0.0564,4.861,0.9509,2.9118,1.5086,1.658,0.924,5.2216,0.6596,3.7134,3.4333,2.4491,2.958,6.2085,3.3188,0.9423,4.1198,1.9621,5.3373,2.8076,4.2634,2.4936,1.9717,1.1206,5.8525,0.1975,2.1644,1.9101,1.6564,5.4401,1.8811,2.7652,6.211,0.6389,2.7994,2.6252,0.7757,4.1458,4.253,2.664,5.9504,4.2185,0.2732,3.2473,0.9397,1.9226,4.081,1.6038,1.3448,0.8507,4.6347,1.3501,5.4429,4.6862,0.5101,2.5466,0.9456,0.5432,7.0718,0.81,0.8067,9.8271,7.0736,0.7457,1.174,3.5366,3.7807,3.5228,3.7147,0.0218,1.4293,2.999,2.2074,1.0864,2.3766,0.142,3.9322,6.2703,6.5512,2.8299,3.9283,2.1152,0.4615,4.9968,1.4447,2.0375,3.2823,1.7061,5.618,3.1347,3.4661,4.946,0.601,0.5131,4.0767,3.2045,0.9758,3.3317,1.1059,0.8272,1.123,0.9179,0.2066,0.2224,1.4432,2.1005,1.9029,3.9074,5.5285,4.9826,4.5292,0.2917,1.625,2.819,2.6291,4.8438,2.646,5.3532,1.507,4.4489,4.8699,5.8178,4.0737,0.492,6.1885,4.4355,3.8689,5.9446,3.6807,1.677,4.3797,7.0029,1.1152,0.6679,3.3067,1.2264,4.1163,1.8455,0.3645,3.0678,1.9405,5.1468,4.6513,5.5676,2.8788,2.7313,2.8229,9.7717,0.7902,0.4535,4.0499,1.9801,6.2937,4.1945,3.2453,1.3058,2.9213,1.3371,4.7721,3.0478,0.5483,0.0837,0.911,2.6601,1.2124,0.0433,3.2682,2.6134,2.6044,7.5572,3.3533,0.0431,0.8735,2.2388,5.6547,0.5964,1.2274,2.1099,5.6011,2.5328,6.9667,0.3921,0.7145]}

And with SpaceX reportedly working on another plan to bring astronauts to the space station in the event of a long-lasting power loss, or catastrophic failure of the International Space Station, it seems like mankind has no problem with making the jump.\nFor many of us, the idea of being stranded on another world forever seems like the ultimate fantasy.

Some think that man can only move to another space station if it\u2019s designed to be inhabitable, while others seem to believe that civilization can find other means to survive long enough to reach another star system.\nFor these reasons, and so many other ones, humans never really say goodbye to Earth and the environment we\u2019ve grown to depend on for our survival. Our technology isn\u2019t big enough to create a new habitat that will sustain our lifestyles, our desires or our lifespans, so we\u2019ll need to find other ways to keep ourselves alive on this world.\nIf you think about it, it\u2019s not that hard to imagine people living outside of Earth, if there is another planet that has water, air and food.","token_len":504,"entropy":[11.3226,3.7136,1.5578,4.8543,12.9999,4.13,1.751,6.3826,3.4586,2.4225,2.6327,5.926,1.3726,1.958,1.4187,1.0381,8.1389,4.4986,1.4507,3.4343,2.0198,1.85,13.8163,9.0217,8.3386,2.8882,5.2079,5.4611,1.2089,4.952,0.6741,1.9354,2.9662,5.367,3.3579,2.5824,1.1309,1.1159,3.3088,2.8151,0.8355,0.1071,0.3924,2.7438,1.7612,0.4175,0.0785,0.3911,4.8794,4.0222,2.6008,6.0526,4.694,1.3673,1.4841,2.2028,1.3938,0.0307,1.8254,8.112,1.8548,9.9806,7.8577,6.3463,1.9114,8.2132,0.6085,0.726,0.5675,5.9971,1.4555,5.1731,14.5242,7.3619,3.5295,6.2198,6.7298,6.3758,1.2074,2.9984,0.4485,1.2768,4.2942,0.6288,2.2066,6.4917,1.6604,5.2597,2.2453,5.9772,2.4698,3.5109,2.8512,2.4241,2.9933,1.1357,1.7386,0.9906,4.0304,4.5762,6.7314,0.1354,1.1989,2.2324,0.344,5.0856,1.363,1.4693,1.5548,1.3456,0.757,2.1149,9.4075,2.3671,2.1295,2.6628,5.1014,4.5893,5.2305,0.5995,4.4965,0.6678,6.7217,0.0138,0.0312,0.0243,2.3222,3.4212,4.3835,7.209,2.5821,1.9328,1.1058,3.4884,1.4164,1.1354,3.4136,2.4622,4.4559,2.5481,3.5653,0.6245,0.8211,2.7657,1.4591,2.2568,4.1698,0.0247,5.0146,2.6289,0.4782,0.7403,6.9097,5.3514,1.5232,7.2014,0.0659,2.9442,3.1149,1.7129,1.9075,3.849,4.6783,1.0529,3.664,6.7006,0.5546,1.6845,7.9166,9.8107,1.0321,1.2831,2.1652,4.967,0.2963,5.6989,2.6499,0.527,3.8937,2.4964,3.2298,2.7955,2.5373,2.0271,0.373,0.3623,1.5562,6.743,1.6977,2.0332,2.078,10.092,2.119,0.1783,4.1302,2.7844,1.4613,5.6384,4.0977,1.9364,3.1656,6.7832,4.5398,0.0108,4.9937,3.3989,6.2618,2.8432,3.3704,0.7759,6.1071,2.199,0.5869,0.6713,13.6587,6.3177,1.6492,3.0873,0.0051,0.5817,6.4942,3.807,6.7034,5.4965,3.4803,0.8752,4.5654,5.735,0.9222,3.2407,1.4731,0.3712,0.5893,3.4106,0.0275,2.4699,1.0426,4.4116,0.1158,0.6109,5.5643,0.8306,5.3786,4.4263,3.8262,0.2723,7.5896,6.1211,1.9151,1.6668,0.6783,4.19,0.0025,0.0026,0.3714,2.2656,2.4586,2.2815,7.7293,2.2525,3.7362,7.1922,2.0066,4.772,1.3985,4.2814,0.9288,0.2624,4.9943,4.0657,2.8203,0.6052,0.4108,1.2854,4.0096,0.2683,3.4107,1.0126,1.0499,3.4159,3.6983,6.99,2.0657,1.3994,2.1166,2.2892,4.5211,0.7739,4.6133,2.4068,2.4077,4.6132,8.4564,3.2669,3.0387,2.3883,3.4956,4.6055,3.6096,7.2244,3.7897,5.3561,0.891,2.1962,2.5192,2.2693,1.4119,0.7618,0.6218,6.2203,1.7259,1.96,3.321,4.7159,3.5151,1.9979,3.449,0.0023,5.6379,1.5646,0.3804,2.2491,1.2295,2.4307,3.3779,11.3752,2.1642,1.0261,2.9167,1.0036,5.0962,0.4055,8.8884,3.6791,5.1272,4.708,5.9905,5.9661,4.1476,5.4209,5.3723,2.0301,4.9826,2.9647,0.0641,0.0031,0.4249,6.4786,3.9162,1.8927,7.1343,2.9781,2.4886,5.1294,2.5426,0.9391,6.904,0.2424,2.3869,2.7904,5.0534,0.2592,0.0023,6.5859,1.0089,1.9431,7.7256,0.0156,1.764,1.9419,0.1408,6.3327,0.4909,1.8879,0.4087,5.5896,1.5211,5.9982,2.6594,2.199,0.6354,1.3164,4.473,0.2708,0.2777,3.4316,2.3543,3.4325,1.8546,0.4712,0.4493,3.5201,4.7745,1.4602,0.1624,4.264,4.6224,0.2163,1.9681,5.6788,0.121,5.6447,7.3595,1.9292,7.0302,1.0407,0.3035,1.8061,2.9033,2.6023,5.4609,2.4727,11.1271,0.5075,1.65,4.9585,1.5873,3.5222,0.5559,0.925,1.8636,0.4684,0.5675,5.2885,6.4848,4.7139,1.1193,1.1639,0.0727,7.5081,0.0569,0.3947,5.3029,1.3951,3.1448,5.9717,3.8812,2.424,4.0835,2.728,5.8977,1.4156,2.5384,7.495,4.7447,0.5635,8.7534,0.2447,0.0001,0.7843,3.2829,1.1819,4.5441,0.0338,1.7812,3.7468,0.5337,2.7835,2.1085,1.499,0.1901,3.9099,2.142,0.4735,3.8887,2.5077,4.0019,0.8069,0.6028,3.6501,2.1586,3.0164,2.3437,0.2754,0.3688,2.3925,1.0323,0.0355,0.0153,2.3164,2.0792,1.7404,0.6097,1.2174,4.9157,1.7565,5.588,0.7172,1.9586,2.7056,4.3428,3.3485,2.1981,5.1783,2.146,1.8192,2.9285,6.413,1.2667,1.5296,1.2507,1.6323,1.6804]}

Over the months, we have taken on a more sophisticated sound with an increasingly heavy mix in both instrumentation and vocals. But without the hard, driving energy of our early years which can be appreciated over the songs that showcase the band's heavier side, we've also gained an increasing sense of intimacy when it comes to the lyrical content.","token_len":505,"entropy":[11.1556,0.3802,2.0843,9.6884,1.1902,5.398,0.6796,5.0304,7.5258,1.1978,4.1853,1.4198,4.2457,4.299,4.9707,1.0382,4.119,4.598,8.5022,0.0343,0.8236,1.8133,8.2011,6.669,2.5273,9.4944,3.7734,1.4784,3.3865,1.399,3.6799,6.2748,3.6992,4.1982,1.4396,3.9336,1.9501,4.5474,3.8082,8.3634,3.1569,5.2247,4.874,1.4818,2.9642,3.5555,6.9829,1.4667,1.9126,2.4394,4.6748,9.0579,10.6428,4.4428,1.9844,4.2779,1.4362,4.9778,2.269,6.1406,4.6987,1.989,1.8211,5.2475,1.7368,3.6108,5.0786,3.519,0.3905,1.2855,0.7919,1.2441,2.3964,3.3921,7.0473,0.8896,3.7698,1.137,1.5725,1.1921,1.2885,2.4938,2.8271,3.339,5.1727,4.2264,0.0148,0.9131,5.545,3.5474,3.4428,5.9357,2.5134,0.3688,5.0823,1.4894,2.8558,5.4663,1.7129,4.8168,0.2008,3.449,4.7758,1.0838,6.373,3.8251,1.3251,6.4904,1.3394,1.6278,2.6671,5.3162,2.3399,3.8561,4.1754,4.9048,2.3559,5.4363,1.8279,4.3266,0.45,7.5166,3.315,5.9513,4.6469,2.4106,4.8777,0.673,1.6234,3.6714,3.4044,0.2352,0.6988,3.1778,5.569,1.9005,3.4006,6.0603,3.7408,5.2102,1.2332,4.0058,0.0042,0.1098,1.8219,0.8495,5.2454,0.4282,0.1906,2.2719,9.521,1.5239,1.37,3.2186,3.3116,2.0038,0.5994,1.1261,2.6894,3.4171,3.0737,5.1318,2.2947,1.4999,5.5014,2.58,5.8289,3.6887,6.2653,3.2836,5.1125,3.7182,1.2892,4.1931,6.3187,1.6849,8.3599,1.9794,5.1199,1.0277,2.2347,0.6657,0.2233,1.5648,3.8304,5.5204,5.5696,0.5972,2.1777,1.5762,2.2765,1.2706,5.3811,4.6465,2.1147,6.035,0.4006,3.9091,6.4825,3.6194,1.9285,5.2203,5.5834,0.5348,3.2841,1.0078,5.6845,1.3543,7.1123,2.0396,0.2251,0.184,0.8111,2.3382,3.4784,5.0023,0.2096,3.1306,1.304,2.638,0.8102,2.4256,2.9122,5.7043,3.6727,2.8589,0.7424,5.3426,0.9709,2.3472,0.7548,1.2943,1.2216,1.7819,4.1186,2.298,2.9655,4.0923,2.2553,1.9359,1.0109,4.9468,0.461,7.7142,1.2398,0.3235,3.9985,2.1972,5.0643,1.696,9.1497,3.5226,2.7422,8.0454,0.5447,1.3049,2.2005,1.6261,1.5486,4.6647,2.0098,0.965,1.9854,3.6137,4.9194,1.6995,3.4209,2.2258,0.8452,2.8235,1.5695,2.7456,0.1519,2.3742,1.9569,2.049,0.3584,1.3359,0.7417,4.8115,1.1996,2.6428,0.0591,3.2722,2.8216,2.0995,3.1691,0.1341,3.3976,0.9467,2.6977,2.7325,2.363,5.3542,1.0386,1.5643,2.0892,1.2106,0.7259,2.1883,4.1339,3.2577,1.4351,5.5923,3.1894,1.4226,1.9887,4.6353,1.8369,2.4575,0.1338,2.5233,0.3017,1.8416,4.8573,0.6465,0.3911,0.017,0.5191,0.6705,2.9317,0.2802,1.5327,1.768,5.0763,5.4256,3.8592,4.0662,0.734,2.7027,4.6272,4.8369,2.6915,5.4516,0.9543,0.8313,0.518,0.8367,6.513,0.3509,0.5995,5.2595,2.5299,1.9928,6.3322,4.635,0.6877,2.2666,1.8846,4.9938,3.0093,2.2456,3.6844,5.8765,1.5714,1.1806,0.0074,0.6533,4.65,0.4968,5.08,0.5776,6.9291,1.5487,7.9466,1.195,5.5927,6.8217,2.0607,0.7176,0.0886,5.6337,1.2076,4.9556,3.5775,0.3644,4.5713,0.4716,5.5258,2.4836,0.7411,0.7018,9.4502,0.2881,0.5616,2.7491,0.0542,0.9578,0.7115,2.6446,0.3189,7.0919,7.274,5.5638,0.0918,2.5694,1.1536,4.4028,4.5163,1.3414,0.9292,2.1951,6.4233,4.0611,5.0841,5.2279,1.6073,0.0245,2.0717,1.0443,5.4089,1.0058,2.3714,2.5521,5.6377,0.0089,9.1596,0.5324,1.1665,3.0063,3.9966,1.5184,8.1742,0.4732,0.0027,8.0189,0.0154,5.6113,4.0452,0.2833,1.0549,2.9631,6.8222,1.4257,4.1288,0.7816,4.3475,0.2663,6.9694,2.3436,3.8037,0.9299,4.4715,2.6235,1.2338,4.472,5.1515,1.807,1.7942,3.3455,4.9499,5.0721,5.3655,5.8553,4.4539,6.6557,0.5666,0.0927,3.2993,0.8472,5.6593,6.3814,1.7001,5.5398,3.724,7.5549,5.405,0.7526,3.8928,2.2638,2.5041,6.5582,4.1507,1.3043,6.4272,6.0051,1.8341,7.0403,2.8821,7.8465,1.5389,0.6727,0.5467,7.393,2.8378,0.4241,1.4966,4.2188,5.8686,5.2516,2.495,5.0965,3.151,0.0681,5.4208,5.9888,1.2798,0.0109,0.0151,1.5883,5.425,0.0175,0.508,1.8239]}
{"prompt":"The reason why vigilantes , a la 'The Punisher ' , do not exist in our world .","text":"The reason why vigilantes, a la 'The Punisher ', do not exist in our world. It's because we are supposedly in a better society than the one depicted in the comic books and movies and the only way to do away with people that have bad intentions is to use the law of the land. And why exactly did we not have vigilantism then?\nThe American Civil War, even though it was not a purely ethnic conflict, was fought on the racial lines. Civil war is a perfect example for how vigilantism can arise as an over reaction from such kind of a conflict.\nThe reason why we have a military police force, but no law enforcement is that they have an obvious conflict of interest. There are no criminals and yet they still patrol in plain clothes and at night.\nThe US is actually not an exception here. Some countries do have a public security force, but they operate on the civil side. However, it's always there when there is a need and it's better than no service at all because there are many people in countries like Brazil for example who wouldn't have any idea who to turn to if their lives get in danger.\nAll these arguments would not be very convincing if the US wouldn't have a civil defence force in each city. Civil defence forces do not necessarily have to be military uniform but are much like a police department with civilian personnel. A civil defence force is primarily a first aid response force and it is not a military police force because there are no criminals.\nIt's like if a car broke down a while ago. Is there a chance that the driver called the regular repair service and the police as well to solve the problem.\nWhen a car breaks down, people go to their local repair shop or mechanics. The police are called in only as a last resort, a civil defence is much like that. But the difference is that police will respond and police can give warnings like they did for drivers who hit a deer that just happened to be in the other lane ( i.e. it is not a civil defence force that will give such warnings ).\nThe civil defence force operates on a civilian level, the cops operate on a military level and we do not have a lot of examples in history of an actual police force that was involved in a race war or ethnic conflict.\nThe reason why we have a military police force is that its primary reason of being was to provide security for major weapons complexes and other sensitive infrastructure such as nuclear power plants.","token_len":505,"entropy":[7.5234,2.8085,13.3113,0.2122,4.017,5.9235,3.9504,6.5399,2.6098,5.8546,0.0436,9.0947,4.9313,0.7417,5.3981,2.0712,3.9217,2.6352,4.6189,2.9595,1.2175,1.1095,1.751,1.775,8.3712,4.3269,1.3798,4.7182,5.0827,2.0838,1.6483,2.0772,6.0414,0.4498,1.1459,2.3621,2.6961,3.0811,2.8897,4.2705,2.719,3.8441,1.7699,0.5828,3.4772,6.6008,0.0407,6.0066,4.4473,3.2383,5.0208,2.6065,0.538,0.4967,3.5911,2.9157,3.1817,4.9049,1.5779,0.9081,1.1631,3.4875,6.0054,8.0658,3.6918,1.7541,3.1306,2.9638,3.1379,3.1243,5.1815,0.2862,1.0648,4.4735,5.8556,2.6117,3.8655,2.7998,5.0529,1.603,0.7458,0.9071,3.1305,1.7266,6.2838,5.9118,1.1594,0.3543,0.9244,3.0605,2.2511,0.9235,6.7626,1.4307,0.9636,4.7735,2.2695,2.2899,1.5522,7.0535,0.3562,5.0231,2.2045,3.6468,0.252,1.9274,6.3098,3.9209,2.4615,5.4135,6.5355,4.9024,6.7919,9.3421,0.1443,3.5459,5.1633,0.5793,2.0105,1.9552,4.4614,0.3173,2.1059,1.7297,2.5683,5.7685,4.3748,1.5472,2.1446,4.9574,3.4028,2.6463,1.0836,4.6726,3.5441,3.112,2.5394,3.9715,6.4725,4.8745,0.6406,0.0795,0.8892,3.876,1.0626,2.1265,6.5329,2.9806,7.0262,1.8249,4.3289,4.3786,4.1384,3.9074,1.4781,1.9673,5.0768,0.5044,0.6497,2.1571,1.9325,5.039,2.7043,5.1999,3.7767,2.8065,5.2329,5.4252,0.5712,5.6944,3.2645,3.6164,0.5924,1.6827,6.2849,2.3135,1.4015,1.1964,0.9513,1.623,5.7332,2.7779,1.5179,5.074,1.8766,1.2629,5.624,0.2344,3.133,1.4639,4.9902,5.5385,2.8851,2.1345,0.9407,0.9144,3.8871,2.9105,2.4901,1.189,6.3285,2.9238,2.5723,5.3077,1.0685,0.0073,4.6308,2.0753,1.3398,3.6354,2.6136,2.2974,7.6935,1.9477,4.1724,5.9472,0.7582,1.4853,5.8738,0.0004,2.4204,3.3958,3.62,2.921,3.7771,4.4054,0.2054,1.4083,3.7194,3.9188,7.4429,0.4882,1.8594,0.3042,0.5492,5.4289,2.768,6.4654,4.5994,3.1214,1.6663,5.0446,1.6741,0.505,2.2393,1.9953,6.7421,0.0005,0.9375,1.4826,4.8402,5.9093,1.3957,3.5444,6.024,4.7927,1.2181,5.7267,0.8657,2.0364,3.9674,1.924,5.5396,1.6646,0.8205,0.5142,4.6984,8.249,3.8408,3.6143,4.5734,4.9983,2.6121,1.3349,3.6153,3.8363,5.1178,2.5252,0.9575,4.0455,2.0643,0.1207,0.6891,1.2333,6.7365,1.734,7.15,1.1574,4.2705,2.768,2.1819,2.7528,1.5197,2.294,1.9312,2.779,2.4637,0.517,3.9191,2.5322,0.6546,1.6058,6.1255,1.6365,1.047,3.6171,0.9261,3.8141,3.3779,2.0872,3.2526,5.3447,0.1096,4.8223,4.8217,0.3204,1.388,6.643,1.5694,0.9387,3.9692,0.9519,1.479,2.1189,8.6857,1.2012,11.8815,8.7211,4.2915,1.4622,2.3991,2.2236,7.8856,0.8578,4.6587,6.5121,0.2499,0.2913,2.2199,1.7906,4.4192,2.4358,1.5383,0.4769,0.0272,1.156,4.2957,3.7964,0.9095,3.4276,1.9792,6.0351,1.0506,3.3165,9.1065,3.515,2.3063,2.5165,2.0893,3.8607,1.6238,6.2701,4.3536,1.0642,1.0627,0.0208,2.6342,4.1216,6.1734,0.3501,4.1436,5.0164,1.749,2.2498,0.5189,3.8005,2.2365,5.479,0.3407,0.5558,3.4615,3.9153,4.1214,3.8049,4.8068,3.2613,6.2147,7.431,6.2888,3.2971,1.8351,3.1503,8.397,1.8912,4.2827,1.4676,5.3453,4.5837,4.851,2.0868,0.0404,1.2632,1.8913,0.8931,6.6311,1.8028,5.2879,9.5571,0.1264,0.0008,0.2045,3.7431,2.8534,1.5869,1.1902,3.0321,0.0869,2.9822,4.2732,2.8516,3.3357,5.4787,1.5193,4.4232,0.5692,2.1384,4.1301,0.1102,1.9641,5.3037,1.8517,1.3213,4.9504,1.7087,1.9381,3.6163,4.4101,5.7317,0.4022,0.5744,1.3649,0.107,2.2367,4.947,3.2024,0.2483,0.5075,0.9023,6.6858,0.0428,6.686,2.8839,3.9543,1.5547,3.7599,3.3432,2.8594,0.354,2.799,3.7681,4.5219,0.2629,1.7219,7.1579,1.3402,2.1245,5.1367,0.6351,0.4457,0.7672,2.0228,2.7806,0.2681,1.3266,0.6406,0.785,1.7149,0.0603,0.0778,0.9464,1.4278,5.6488,3.6394,6.2598,4.9751,2.0657,4.0104,0.3833,3.1973,3.1127,1.4013,7.8492,10.5859,6.523,1.8808,3.7391,5.1419,3.2081,2.4397,0.0028,3.8377,1.7698,0.276,0.9685]}

What do you think?\u201d\nAnd, oh, yes, there was a story behind the picture that night\u2026 Dr. C. was talking about a patient of his. Her husband had recently died and she wasn\u2019t able to get over it. And he wrote that he could see how much stress the situation was causing her, since the picture would provide a bit of \u201cnormal life\u201d for her now, a bit of family time, and he would know that she was doing good. (This story didn\u2019t come out in the publication, but you can read about it here. )\nIt\u2019s also interesting to look at the different types of art that Dr. C. creates. This is a list I found in the book of what you should know about autism and it is fascinating:\nPaintings of friends and family, such as a family portrait (his mother\u2019s, his wife\u2019s, & their sons\u2019).","token_len":506,"entropy":[12.9358,5.0822,14.7875,4.9058,2.4429,6.9989,1.2603,7.7102,3.4665,3.3525,7.4997,0.7617,4.2805,1.9873,5.0989,2.7337,2.1737,4.8525,1.959,5.0846,2.912,3.5492,2.3765,2.8673,3.6776,4.8015,15.91,7.6596,1.8026,3.6533,1.6926,2.1413,0.8498,6.8495,3.1403,1.2455,5.7598,4.6028,3.8156,3.7122,2.5049,4.8426,3.0638,0.9922,3.0852,2.1634,2.4756,3.311,1.0588,9.4061,0.2241,2.2903,4.671,4.3436,4.1992,6.0089,0.4259,2.2751,9.3204,5.6409,1.9752,6.1079,1.9441,6.8107,4.7091,3.2982,2.8726,0.1386,4.8743,4.7775,3.9069,2.998,3.4943,1.7241,0.0024,3.7603,1.5372,0.894,2.3014,2.4688,7.6414,5.642,6.3886,6.0415,1.4188,7.5292,0.8334,4.4272,1.467,2.2141,3.1534,3.187,7.9479,1.966,8.1555,0.7134,0.9986,3.6384,4.6841,4.3189,4.5633,6.9585,1.5021,5.0757,3.8105,3.7137,3.129,4.0366,3.9412,3.9209,0.8769,2.6469,6.3034,2.6248,7.3414,5.489,5.3823,5.4635,4.5838,1.749,5.4199,3.4627,3.6962,3.8486,5.8192,1.1509,3.8237,1.0208,0.3441,2.0064,6.7729,5.2208,2.6754,2.0781,5.8409,3.3254,3.9636,1.5124,3.8693,3.5962,5.2597,0.1058,4.0515,1.9821,0.9574,1.0566,3.1851,3.2286,0.9521,6.6453,8.3493,1.1902,1.6741,1.4173,4.1109,3.4978,2.0872,3.2234,3.334,0.6639,5.6916,3.3573,5.3385,0.5251,1.994,3.77,5.3076,2.4947,8.0052,4.0339,3.2098,4.635,1.0877,4.0268,1.9697,4.9417,1.4923,5.5624,6.2287,4.3058,5.7313,11.1227,4.411,6.8631,1.4426,2.6185,1.8653,0.6426,6.3558,1.1886,3.314,3.2072,2.9977,1.8104,1.8061,6.1606,5.8987,0.6741,2.5048,0.2201,0.0157,0.0095,0.0011,0.2389,0.0034,0.808,0.4066,0.0251,3.5666,1.4452,4.0025,6.1681,1.4108,6.8613,2.0516,7.586,0.1958,6.2323,1.997,8.2425,3.1305,1.7936,3.6072,0.7281,2.2585,4.5885,1.0365,3.7234,1.4358,3.5083,1.5123,2.3997,2.167,1.7411,6.2305,0.8248,2.2989,4.1397,3.7195,1.431,6.1482,3.7134,2.3275,3.4872,2.2479,6.2146,1.5594,0.8666,1.562,0.6258,0.4638,0.6525,1.2567,5.2324,1.9825,4.8125,7.0947,1.0303,1.2144,0.4475,0.7064,5.4345,1.8711,0.9026,2.8466,0.6254,1.4792,4.2323,2.0351,5.5331,1.1331,5.2468,5.9552,8.7425,2.1638,2.5987,2.1082,4.4027,1.6615,0.5174,1.5672,5.4925,0.8927,1.7146,5.4133,4.3812,3.3529,4.2875,1.0587,3.9389,1.4033,3.254,4.7218,2.6685,1.0631,0.8213,0.8605,0.7655,8.1625,0.4159,2.4036,4.0115,1.6939,4.1663,4.7396,2.5092,0.0831,1.6378,1.7946,0.9354,0.6644,0.2486,4.6111,4.0846,6.1103,1.2264,3.754,0.4078,4.5255,1.0579,0.6371,5.1814,4.8827,2.0967,0.9261,3.1842,5.512,3.382,6.0485,0.0156,0.2407,0.2707,3.0887,4.2986,0.9896,2.5727,4.4838,4.9377,1.0536,2.0042,6.5955,2.4028,1.7738,4.0194,1.244,1.2092,1.6743,5.3512,1.8744,1.8603,0.3959,2.3828,0.0123,2.0409,5.6659,2.323,0.5722,3.004,1.7535,4.9469,2.9993,1.9057,4.2192,2.9108,4.0823,2.7221,6.1818,2.4526,4.729,0.8597,2.2017,0.9334,2.4474,6.2288,2.5519,3.0392,4.2304,6.8269,1.4374,5.8369,0.1466,11.0465,1.9083,7.4252,3.994,2.2623,1.6328,3.2419,0.9013,6.2228,3.0708,4.5728,2.4976,0.3441,5.5778,2.9771,1.6545,1.274,3.5813,2.0886,5.1665,2.1093,1.3559,0.8651,4.0865,4.337,0.6459,5.5221,4.3792,2.2227,5.3908,0.8115,0.3116,0.0655,2.6841,1.4475,2.9064,1.2073,6.153,2.7316,0.715,4.3785,0.7492,1.4455,1.5271,0.2003,0.6005,2.5926,2.9272,0.3398,3.9924,3.5157,0.2991,0.6289,4.2008,2.3285,0.7347,4.0362,0.2046,1.547,6.1709,3.2148,0.0179,3.9342,1.4663,2.7372,0.013,0.1068,0.2728,3.9205,0.9273,4.6531,0.9732,2.1565,5.3073,4.348,3.1928,2.2969,1.8212,2.8432,3.6672,5.0564,4.7773,2.7644,2.8074,0.3231,10.1189,1.8456,4.6941,1.8372,5.6967,3.9069,0.4361,5.727,3.2297,2.4885,1.4101,6.296,1.223,0.498,2.504,4.5597,0.0026,3.0705,2.8291,1.8247,3.9697,6.3836,4.5868,4.4714,0.5326,0.8039,4.8343,2.9358,3.6063,0.8138,0.0399,0.0052,0.4209,6.895,2.4065,4.0253,1.7729,0.2553,4.15]}

Now 10 years later, the company is struggling and looking to end their lifetime supply promotions, to save money, by any means necessary. As part of my job I read blogs and share some of the nasty comments people leave, along with the answers of the companies who are responding to them.\nThe response to this letter was the most disturbing, the company is still trying to explain away every part of this promotional campaign and it seems like they are doing this not to fix the problem of their sales, but because their sales volume is declining.\nThe company will even send out an email to their current customer base to help with the bad press, saying it all started because they stopped the lifetime supply promotion and customers started complaining.\nI don't think we are being too harsh when we think about this being a marketing play to make the sales volume down. What you should be asking them, instead of the lifetime supply promotion, is what the actual problem is?\nI still wonder how a company that makes a product they say'should last a lifetime', but which has problems even after many years of their product being in market could still be considered a 'boss product '. There is no problem with the product, but rather with the marketing strategy, the strategy should have been to get people to use the product more, and not sell it out of time.\nAll the companies seem to be doing, is making promises, not delivering on them, and it is my opinion that this is a bad example for other businesses to follow.\nI am interested to know if there is any other advice that is more useful to customers who are trying to get hold of the product? Or does anyone have the email address of this company? Maybe I could write them an email.\nI saw the \"Don't Worry\" ad yesterday morning on the FOX television as I was driving to my office and it's a joke I was laughing my butt off! The whole image of her and her dog is hilarious and funny, along with her comment about not caring what others think. She's right. She can go do what she wants to do and the people don't have to worry because I say so. And I also understand the pressure people are having to sell this product. I can relate to that. But, she's still not helping anyone with her life story, she makes light of what others are saying, and I think it's just plain rude.","token_len":507,"entropy":[5.2847,8.5886,3.1144,4.7237,1.081,6.3968,6.8611,3.8293,5.6753,4.1881,6.4687,3.854,9.3104,5.003,0.2271,5.0183,16.3009,5.591,1.2857,0.0009,5.1592,0.1313,2.2016,7.1757,11.7757,6.8386,3.3552,16.2898,2.4903,12.8717,0.5164,15.0184,5.6165,10.1649,7.3606,2.8375,2.8801,5.9,7.833,0.1484,0.078,0.3886,6.2797,5.2476,0.0005,5.1319,2.1916,3.0527,5.8077,6.5785,1.7249,6.0748,4.5175,1.0847,1.1534,10.3885,3.1476,3.8955,4.9626,3.6641,5.8915,0.0642,2.8214,6.2878,5.2812,2.4997,4.1138,2.4966,2.6828,6.2588,0.9342,0.6445,0.243,1.6541,6.3594,5.0327,1.9438,1.7937,4.9745,2.1009,4.6066,2.5087,3.8097,2.4947,3.216,5.9436,3.5663,4.3661,2.8822,0.0528,4.5193,3.7224,5.2162,4.7419,0.091,1.8133,10.8159,2.0597,1.9583,3.6829,2.5779,1.9611,1.6207,1.3254,3.6179,2.5499,4.8289,1.497,5.3576,0.9168,1.052,3.4247,3.1553,4.9213,1.4475,0.195,3.1088,3.379,2.3861,6.5725,0.7039,3.245,0.7323,1.3368,2.3518,1.6211,4.6889,6.7497,4.3945,1.0097,2.312,0.8629,1.0382,1.4098,4.9821,3.012,2.1156,1.9845,5.0385,4.037,1.5305,7.6739,3.3941,1.8817,4.4987,3.1761,7.0756,3.5727,2.6393,1.3232,4.9589,3.7278,7.8933,0.5464,0.5719,2.1812,6.8183,3.0469,2.5107,1.2066,0.7398,2.4928,2.9665,0.0008,1.8432,4.3663,2.9082,3.9848,4.2146,2.4301,3.9462,0.3489,5.8261,0.6152,1.2499,7.9091,1.1076,2.143,9.1203,2.8708,3.0074,2.4252,2.9019,4.6992,4.939,0.8013,4.4276,4.4571,4.0825,1.3897,3.3337,3.8881,4.6318,5.1241,0.7849,3.7512,7.4067,0.1667,0.8579,0.8153,0.2122,2.7338,2.4579,5.0977,2.3871,0.1964,2.0269,0.8862,2.4799,5.9254,4.8728,1.9977,4.2056,0.352,1.9999,3.9677,2.4767,5.4094,4.554,5.8172,6.8048,15.2694,3.4898,6.6513,3.0378,0.1645,13.3097,3.4843,6.9283,2.9327,6.4994,5.5653,2.0796,4.9627,0.4302,1.1199,5.6499,2.4246,1.9116,3.1464,4.8821,7.2859,3.9293,1.4933,3.4499,0.7751,4.9708,12.2244,3.7166,7.4535,5.0729,1.1899,1.2382,4.7485,0.9458,2.1714,1.9393,1.6752,1.7065,6.1043,1.851,0.6606,3.6013,3.3875,2.5096,2.1814,5.3819,5.6646,2.6628,0.8713,1.2807,3.4714,2.2621,0.5201,4.3939,1.2561,0.067,3.2657,1.7122,1.7955,2.3377,4.0178,0.4921,3.9819,2.0904,7.4648,0.9398,0.7032,5.9379,2.2418,3.1386,5.2843,0.1194,0.8214,2.3889,6.8712,4.5212,3.2872,5.2412,2.1764,3.6432,3.9824,1.6235,0.5432,1.6912,1.056,2.8936,2.1233,6.4615,2.1257,0.3189,1.5673,0.7499,1.599,3.6379,4.8664,2.9513,4.4298,3.6075,2.0147,0.5951,0.411,0.767,2.1317,2.5358,5.964,0.7178,0.9616,1.767,2.4772,0.8383,1.1149,1.8028,5.5431,1.8545,3.1127,2.6059,4.0418,0.949,4.4298,2.9132,0.91,3.3669,0.061,2.3248,6.4251,0.0162,2.4734,0.9703,3.7875,4.9006,4.2933,3.3764,1.6489,4.2417,6.7606,0.5052,2.4459,2.5489,1.0923,1.3726,6.2904,2.635,3.7025,2.8339,4.6901,2.3637,0.1274,2.0604,1.0288,2.3028,6.7499,2.3282,5.5659,5.2309,0.0869,6.0111,0.0405,1.4152,2.5197,5.7326,5.5986,2.4974,1.9276,8.3722,5.9446,7.1426,2.1089,0.8997,2.4281,2.4535,2.4901,2.2507,2.4948,3.266,4.1859,2.1721,7.3049,3.2175,3.9105,3.5027,3.5071,2.6214,0.0476,5.4985,3.1277,4.6494,6.5772,1.0393,7.5352,4.0486,1.0343,5.163,1.7615,4.5007,1.7224,3.1442,1.4386,8.109,0.0113,2.0906,6.1166,1.3024,4.3054,3.1307,2.7399,1.9317,0.1301,1.6798,3.4696,2.5086,4.4069,2.0725,3.5642,4.1447,4.6143,5.1368,2.6535,0.3465,0.2823,2.9248,0.4789,1.6388,3.4279,2.8515,5.4201,0.0006,2.9838,0.3262,1.7708,4.8209,5.5735,5.5046,1.9892,0.6406,4.3874,2.1111,3.8205,4.2313,2.1409,6.2405,3.1931,1.727,2.6637,1.1451,3.2185,4.0293,0.1792,1.3633,1.8373,3.5254,4.7062,0.6512,1.337,1.0397,3.5672,3.817,3.9828,1.602,4.4389,2.598,4.6333,3.3796,3.5272,1.9458,3.4875,5.6441,1.6327,2.5453,6.6275,9.1009,0.0429,3.1943,2.4238,1.1322,1.4815,1.3575,0.5626,3.1134,1.6958,1.9885,0.5842,3.6916,3.9635,3.8609,1.0423]}

What happened ?","text":"You are watching a live stream from the international space station. The video feed goes out due to a temporary loss of signal. Minutes later, when the live feed comes back on, everyone on the space station is dead, and most of the station in shambles. What happened? Were all the other astronauts killed by the same thing? The dead were frozen stiff as they lay on the ice. One crew member was shot. His hands were frozen and he was cut open. The human body is a complex machine and its maintenance relies on numerous chemicals. Most of these chemicals are obtained from food, especially red meat and dairy, but we also rely on vitamins, mineral, and certain amino acids. One group of vitamins are the water-soluble ones which are broken up into nutrients by our bodies. A deficiency of any of these could cause serious damage to the body. In fact, many vitamins and minerals are considered essential because our bodies cannot make them. Some people complain that they are not getting enough vitamins in their bodies, but is it really the case? How do you know if you have some of these vitamins? If the person is getting too much of a vitaminer in a short period of time, or drinking lots of alcohol, he or she may have an intoxication. An intoxication with vitamin is known as a \u201cvitamin overdose\u201d. Overdoses have been known to result from the regular intake of vitamins such as the following: Calcium Magnesium DHA E-Beta Carotene Vitamin A Thiamin Vitamin B1 Vitamin B2 Vitamin B3 Vitamin B5 Vitamin B6 Vitamin B12 Vitamin C Vitamin D Vitamin E Vitamin K B-vitamins Folic Acid Lutein Betasercan B-Complex Vitamins B12 & Homocysteine Folic Acid Omega-3s If a food or vitamin overdose is suspected, the following steps should be taken: The patient should be seen at first by either a primary care physician or a physician who specializes in toxicology or poison control. Once the patient has been seen by a physician, the following tests should be done. A blood test to detect possible vitamin levels above the normal level. An x-ray scan of the bones to detect possible bone abnormalities. Tests for toxins in the body. A urine testing for drugs and medications. The best treatment in such cases would be to monitor the vitamins level and have the patient rechecked every few days. If symptoms persist, the patient should be seen by a physician.","token_len":508,"entropy":[3.8828,6.265,2.3425,3.9339,1.2869,2.723,1.5436,8.2483,4.6556,0.2775,1.5282,2.6895,3.3568,4.2986,5.548,4.0182,10.2405,0.0301,2.2568,5.6504,6.6186,0.1543,4.1599,1.5543,11.0704,0.9821,0.7521,4.7291,0.8132,3.9721,1.0314,4.0804,0.1581,2.8643,0.4374,5.7808,3.2214,0.4459,4.0213,0.007,1.1632,4.3146,2.7594,1.6,5.1047,0.2909,0.3216,2.8913,6.2464,8.6584,0.2878,0.004,0.3078,5.1419,2.5091,1.6081,6.9603,3.5145,0.6247,3.36,2.5779,2.5724,2.1641,0.7577,4.8575,3.3103,0.1919,3.3108,6.2299,2.7198,7.27,9.4526,3.3537,3.8902,3.0569,1.2236,0.3444,2.9669,1.188,4.6114,4.8236,0.338,1.8256,3.9156,2.9659,5.0016,4.5875,0.3533,3.9156,2.8341,1.5516,1.1047,5.8872,2.9948,0.9371,1.582,6.7382,1.6019,2.9205,4.9472,7.1952,3.6607,2.7031,3.9468,7.2185,6.9662,0.4392,6.0314,7.1383,1.4187,4.9757,0.4367,2.3618,0.4432,0.7931,7.7693,0.7188,4.2238,1.7644,5.4409,5.8808,0.7052,1.6019,3.0548,2.5121,1.8203,4.301,2.2631,5.014,0.103,6.6293,1.126,5.0269,3.2567,0.6923,6.5175,3.6676,0.0142,0.7923,4.3708,5.4218,0.2751,6.9238,2.7025,4.3363,7.5771,2.1591,0.1709,0.0017,4.0213,3.7011,1.3523,5.97,4.5738,0.8782,5.111,3.2557,3.1693,1.32,0.7751,3.9954,5.1076,0.5814,4.2915,0.4314,0.1539,5.7471,1.3802,3.333,1.4853,0.4704,0.6815,0.9625,0.958,3.4502,1.9657,0.2415,3.0188,4.2952,2.3091,0.317,1.0472,5.0449,2.2458,4.8614,4.764,0.2821,4.1445,4.0461,0.6158,1.0345,3.9338,3.4967,6.8383,0.5783,1.3405,1.6759,2.266,2.2193,0.1834,2.0912,3.1311,0.3823,1.9903,1.7009,1.1127,6.738,1.4099,1.0967,3.519,1.1084,0.8488,4.2047,2.2008,1.3057,1.1532,1.3326,1.1373,1.9495,5.0075,2.0712,0.7253,0.7912,1.0621,3.1309,3.1333,3.5751,1.4742,3.3224,2.1482,0.3536,1.5556,2.335,1.5516,16.4776,3.1225,4.4564,3.9659,0.743,0.0907,0.0026,0.2905,3.1691,7.914,6.0848,0.0585,2.2294,0.5624,3.2318,0.5368,0.0017,1.2313,1.8588,2.8087,9.702,1.306,5.1713,3.4094,4.9868,3.3309,4.6072,4.7382,0.064,1.8787,13.0223,7.1041,2.6632,0.0495,3.6897,1.4713,8.4943,1.7114,6.483,4.369,0.5363,4.2367,1.0534,2.3445,0.6657,2.4752,1.6965,2.9483,7.6822,3.0952,0.0211,2.6952,4.2934,0.002,4.5737,3.3983,0.377,4.5511,0.0021,6.4223,0.0018,4.8244,3.7733,4.1628,4.6938,7.2662,5.8436,0.0457,0.4493,2.4632,2.239,6.0231,0.036,0.7099,3.1395,1.3403,3.5839,1.3043,0.8505,1.3351,0.9197,0.5581,0.1006,0.8696,0.4536,2.4097,0.7021,0.3535,0.4087,0.4448,0.1959,5.1714,0.5633,2.4466,1.0556,0.3384,1.3911,0.2543,0.5679,2.8165,5.5442,3.8117,5.8414,1.6193,0.0029,4.8201,0.8086,0.4524,4.9872,2.7867,0.0054,9.5935,12.9461,14.267,3.2015,2.3043,2.5774,10.1032,1.8285,5.3748,0.0077,2.5061,1.5532,6.4812,12.6936,0.0635,0.0105,0.0006,3.6157,0.2017,0.0393,6.2475,0.1365,0.184,3.9021,8.9019,3.0749,6.1439,2.5476,4.4969,9.2862,1.1405,2.1404,0.1942,1.6774,3.8961,3.8525,1.8257,0.0658,0.247,0.889,3.3382,4.0552,0.7099,0.8468,5.6978,2.7843,4.8249,0.969,7.0158,0.9164,6.0282,0.652,0.6477,0.3818,1.0076,2.2412,2.2462,1.3797,0.0044,7.4546,0.0776,1.9689,9.0105,0.5345,0.3137,5.2628,0.8916,0.7187,1.113,0.5633,1.4187,1.8926,0.5285,0.661,0.4171,1.098,3.9614,5.5968,0.8283,0.08,1.5687,3.3521,2.5205,1.4758,0.462,2.9705,2.8622,5.2915,1.9002,5.5864,8.2369,1.7145,2.605,1.7566,2.6655,3.4956,3.8692,0.0136,0.0149,5.1357,1.3317,0.2658,6.9095,1.2782,2.8423,2.7968,5.7058,2.8831,0.3404,5.5361,1.3833,6.5766,2.3386,0.3336,2.1422,0.9587,1.0968,3.5896,6.071,1.9469,5.7344,2.1846,3.9897,0.5337,3.1013,6.4068,4.2766,5.5841,4.6893,0.4136,2.7911,0.0672,0.9033,5.6412,0.8368,6.4288,5.6117,2.3725,5.6778,1.5433,0.5289,8.2142,1.1317,0.0007,1.6606,2.8368,2.192,0.7738,0.8288,2.2982,4.9955,1.9081,0.5053,1.3002,0.6919,0.5599,0.2508,3.2614,0.7519,0.4109,0.8885,1.4454]}
{"prompt":"After you die , you find out that reincarnation is real , however , there is an error and your memories are still intact upon reincarnation .","text":"After you die, you find out that reincarnation is real, however, there is an error and your memories are still intact upon reincarnation.So you are dead now, what is the purpose of reincarnation.\nThe question is asked when we lose our memories after death, will we remember them again after we reincarnate. I don't think so if there is an error in your memory, it wouldn't be the same. We live only once.We must do the important things in life and then die.\nIn Indian mythology, The God Brahma incarnating as a human body to create a world which he will destroy in due time. The Brahma is immortal, he does not die at all.He just gets reincarnated as human and takes birth to do his work.So reincarnation is not a permanent life, it will come to an end.\nSo all religious, philosophic, spiritual, religious groups are different from each other according to the religion they practice, philosophy that they follow, and so on.\nI have a theory to explain reincarnation.\nYou cannot believe what you see and hear.If you want to see then you should be able to see everything with the eyes then you will see all the miracles in this world.What is the miracle of water?Why is water clear?It is not clear if you see it with your eyes, so who told you that the water is clear, you have to see for yourself.\nIn religious practices, people see things happening at a distance, but most of the time they do not see it or they could see it but not notice it.For this reasons, I have a theory to explain reincarnation.\nWhen your eyes are open, you can see everything around you.You can see where you are, you can see the sun, there are hills and mountains around you.So most of the time you can see everything that is around you.Now imagine if your eyes are closed and no one opens them for you, then you have to see everything with your imagination or you will not be able to see anything.\nSo we use our imagination because we can see and hear nothing.You hear only the sounds that are around you and you don't hear anything else.\nIf you do not see or hear anything then you will not know anything.So you must see with your eyes.\nWe have to do the important things in life to know what is the important thing and what is not important.This is the important thing.","token_len":509,"entropy":[4.5152,7.0926,0.5508,1.2263,6.517,1.7366,0.9805,10.6512,0.3964,0.8819,5.1247,1.6065,7.1541,1.3786,3.2009,0.9919,3.1496,4.1429,3.9053,3.5515,3.6677,0.9462,4.3006,3.1293,9.017,2.6139,0.0053,0.3132,7.7946,2.0429,2.6173,5.2783,4.5805,0.9609,4.1736,1.9945,1.2013,3.3628,0.1223,0.8223,0.0267,6.1344,3.5999,6.2819,3.6644,0.8185,5.6707,4.1334,3.655,5.429,0.673,0.6845,3.9576,2.3882,1.4556,4.3723,0.9217,3.4394,1.1474,2.7883,2.481,2.0876,3.7654,0.0816,2.7434,4.2364,3.1831,0.0019,1.5816,1.9141,5.785,3.9041,0.5237,2.8737,0.4062,1.6165,1.3443,0.7402,1.7171,2.7305,5.4955,0.0007,0.7061,3.2893,1.1532,1.7857,4.6529,5.9478,4.8884,3.5669,2.3526,4.8124,4.0997,4.1419,2.8637,7.2556,1.9879,2.3278,0.5671,2.4839,3.7022,3.4157,0.7169,1.2298,4.0188,8.3766,1.1131,0.3255,7.0944,5.2471,6.1697,0.0343,7.0718,6.1064,1.7243,1.8773,3.0675,3.5834,4.9515,4.1715,1.3489,3.602,4.9966,3.202,2.9889,4.3062,3.2346,5.6884,0.3434,0.5917,2.4617,3.4897,0.046,2.2927,5.3542,1.5613,1.8321,3.6586,0.1176,1.2144,4.0401,1.7664,0.9138,4.5532,4.7176,4.6481,2.3224,0.0054,3.0155,3.9969,2.7629,4.9013,7.5243,2.2349,7.8364,1.926,1.3623,0.5188,4.968,5.8766,0.0626,0.5928,2.2697,1.7569,5.1941,5.6337,1.4027,0.9012,4.1234,3.4911,1.6882,0.772,0.0046,2.3696,1.5147,2.826,5.1977,7.6611,4.7637,6.7867,0.4686,1.2244,2.8458,1.2814,2.8961,5.074,2.5003,5.6766,3.075,0.8645,0.0189,7.1307,0.0049,1.8297,4.7779,1.7626,3.8669,2.0207,5.513,5.0239,0.4458,2.152,0.7882,2.0836,2.6091,0.173,0.2162,1.1207,2.6459,2.8912,3.0116,4.1608,3.7002,0.6282,2.6411,0.0165,1.3806,1.1787,4.1168,3.9469,4.2118,3.0524,0.5457,2.6835,2.8247,0.8155,1.1353,5.3405,0.4914,3.5749,0.1579,3.2646,7.4805,1.0788,2.7939,2.9276,0.8432,0.0086,1.532,3.356,5.1057,2.352,2.9455,7.7765,1.0974,3.0622,1.5731,2.9068,1.3647,6.6173,3.3867,3.6668,0.3504,0.5733,5.5518,1.9709,1.355,6.1885,1.3557,7.5965,1.3599,4.8039,1.7995,2.2064,8.6423,0.7893,4.5515,0.6355,2.7031,1.2059,2.8397,2.0991,2.8901,1.8968,3.7664,1.4424,0.5548,1.5891,4.456,6.337,6.4046,0.0649,1.0356,3.1567,1.0043,1.0827,0.5519,2.9865,3.3476,2.7509,0.7942,2.2998,6.2844,0.0767,0.9315,0.8265,3.6931,5.4828,5.3921,0.5932,2.9438,5.0238,1.7796,7.7195,3.7976,2.1931,3.5816,1.4728,2.4317,5.0479,1.2333,0.8324,0.1902,0.9869,2.2373,0.0621,0.8144,2.0668,5.6038,2.3445,6.225,2.7764,0.9636,3.9466,3.4615,6.2458,0.4293,0.4398,6.3504,3.9521,7.9135,0.4191,2.9379,2.4572,1.9359,0.1332,1.0058,0.042,0.4035,0.0014,0.1915,0.434,3.6531,4.6478,3.6605,0.8785,1.7372,0.7215,0.771,1.4396,0.3886,2.1636,4.6928,0.0307,0.8034,3.2444,0.8627,0.7846,5.3051,1.8777,0.5438,1.8552,2.2029,0.1439,0.803,2.214,4.1702,0.5158,4.5555,0.9068,5.4691,1.1624,1.7877,3.155,0.0765,0.9595,4.289,5.9931,0.4673,0.2964,0.1697,0.9386,1.4375,0.3129,2.0377,3.0906,1.0843,1.7721,0.0559,0.8835,5.3973,3.616,2.1394,2.9441,0.6696,1.8892,0.9149,1.4566,5.6001,0.4954,7.0171,0.5678,4.8796,0.1317,1.6601,2.3999,0.7478,3.2184,1.258,1.303,1.3513,3.3228,0.7535,8.1417,4.0258,1.4057,1.1797,1.6942,1.7272,0.0441,0.0047,0.3256,1.4018,0.592,0.8944,2.6636,4.1136,5.7069,3.267,0.7597,4.68,1.0095,2.4518,0.6283,4.1441,1.2661,4.555,0.9349,4.5469,6.0762,3.384,1.7049,1.4218,1.8296,1.4742,2.7347,0.1959,1.9323,1.7974,2.6953,0.001,0.9859,1.3074,1.3743,0.3569,1.1445,2.9268,0.4462,3.4526,0.4738,1.9271,4.4527,0.2789,1.2668,1.9977,0.5698,0.9879,0.9545,2.4396,1.9001,0.8285,2.7239,1.8627,2.902,2.8961,4.0143,0.2396,2.0349,1.3938,0.7358,3.856,2.277,1.4997,3.0882,1.4159,1.1878,0.1032,0.4552,0.0252,2.7713,4.1594,1.5224,0.7139,4.7939,4.4799,0.3083,2.5944,1.4672,0.4182,0.5227,1.0635,0.3341,5.1268,0.5232,1.8222,4.8525,0.5655,1.1808]}

Tired of being vilified , 7 finally sets the record straight .","text":"We've all heard what happened to 9, but always from 6's perspective. Tired of being vilified, 7 finally sets the record straight. Not to mention the two crazy kids trying to kill 6 by throwing themselves off the cliff. There's also a flashback to all the bad things that happened to them at the orphanage. I would have given this one a higher rating,but it really is too short. It is a story we all know, but told from the point of view of none of the children.\nThis is a great movie. With wonderful acting and a great story this movie is one of the best i have seen so far. It also has alot of great music.\nThis is a story you never forget. Great movie with a great message. The movie is filled with good music. All the actors did a great job. The music is filled with up beat music to set the mood of the movie. The story line is very captivating and great. The ending is very sad but what a great message about a family.\nThe first film, \"Sleepwalkers\", was very good except, it was on HBO Family, it was not even on the cable network. The second movie, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", was a total waste and I won't bother to mention it anymore. However, the new movie, \"Runaway\" was so well done, I was so impressed with it. I love the new movie because it is more thought provoking, interesting and original. It's not as simplistic and predictable like the previous two movies. If you are a fan of the first two movies, then I highly recommend that you see \"Runaway\". It is an original movie and you can't go wrong with it. The whole film is very entertaining and has some great songs with the main actress, Miley Cirus, who I still haven't seen. The actors are good and the film is not too slow. \"Runaway\" is a perfect movie. Give it a try and you will enjoy it\nI really enjoyed this movie. It was really interesting to see how the children got into such a bad situation, and made it hard for them to escape. The acting was good, and the music was really cool to hear. The whole movie was a little slow at the beginning, but I think it got better as it went on. I recommend this movie to anyone. It is not to childish, and it has a great message. Even the ending was a good one.","token_len":509,"entropy":[5.1858,3.6438,1.6942,4.8329,2.2292,0.8386,8.3943,5.9805,5.0021,7.9554,5.1066,7.9456,6.3981,4.8885,3.4494,7.5037,3.9981,0.3243,2.6756,8.9727,0.0016,1.8,8.2896,7.5973,8.0673,2.5911,2.5086,0.0028,0.8515,5.2956,3.2561,0.4527,2.2432,6.5108,7.814,3.0206,5.3831,0.0737,2.4502,5.2854,5.105,3.3818,3.9043,3.7366,1.1268,1.6976,0.9112,5.3992,1.0165,4.0343,1.6821,7.7263,1.2668,6.5275,1.1872,4.1911,1.8802,1.2842,0.5003,1.1049,2.7465,3.5728,0.9367,7.9214,0.029,0.9625,2.8583,4.748,2.4906,4.5169,2.7803,2.5288,0.7919,4.6529,0.7812,1.7152,8.6727,2.251,3.5917,2.2905,4.7315,4.2371,0.9305,2.6747,3.1381,2.1488,4.0792,6.4699,2.4348,1.4241,2.6387,1.1249,8.4553,2.5066,1.0686,1.65,0.0667,0.0145,0.0166,8.6894,3.3808,1.9365,4.083,0.6182,3.1599,6.657,1.1066,1.5873,3.0456,3.0386,1.224,6.0301,7.2168,2.4354,1.2745,2.394,1.4625,1.9907,4.9359,2.0197,1.2332,3.2631,0.4492,0.6736,0.45,6.7832,1.5781,0.7018,2.506,0.0062,0.2718,2.2661,4.0327,1.1084,5.6334,0.1893,2.2728,2.0885,1.2685,3.2419,2.5022,0.9141,1.1089,4.8444,3.4095,4.3875,3.566,0.7029,5.6649,3.5681,2.5976,2.0548,0.8887,6.8263,0.4945,3.1507,3.4028,1.1196,4.6677,0.0219,3.2468,3.4456,1.3704,5.2958,1.0917,3.5157,5.2987,1.1148,0.3927,0.0061,1.3177,1.4894,2.561,0.77,7.4575,0.0302,9.0916,7.1486,2.6006,4.5686,5.6779,0.6308,0.7358,2.6295,0.1288,0.3926,0.2275,1.3825,2.8586,6.0175,0.5526,2.2052,7.4182,0.0011,1.3776,5.3046,0.7295,1.6531,3.3785,0.7234,2.2588,3.4222,2.4981,6.0869,3.0138,1.956,5.9932,5.7843,2.4768,3.4316,2.4058,1.0318,2.6194,3.5985,4.093,3.8409,2.8129,8.0972,1.8362,1.9297,0.8291,1.0457,2.7775,1.6962,8.0714,6.0866,2.1676,0.9385,5.8865,7.9699,10.6248,2.944,3.2517,0.54,2.7903,4.3445,1.3093,2.083,4.0915,0.9613,0.4973,2.1125,1.1783,1.8472,0.4833,0.1619,2.2088,5.2938,2.8299,0.9825,0.2796,0.0727,0.2316,0.3609,2.233,5.2256,3.3546,3.243,3.1607,5.3367,0.0402,4.5979,1.6569,3.7226,0.6474,3.9719,0.5458,4.7077,0.1773,2.0226,5.355,1.8192,0.9296,0.2621,7.0776,0.9061,3.5066,1.4703,3.6229,3.6894,1.1292,1.9855,2.1859,3.0104,2.6197,3.2649,1.1119,0.9801,0.6776,1.7413,3.504,1.3425,3.4487,1.6644,3.9143,0.5645,1.2969,3.8974,8.0517,0.4968,1.7581,5.1729,0.7735,5.8183,0.6311,2.0073,2.6628,2.6572,3.5625,6.7173,2.7571,5.5088,4.7134,1.2285,1.9316,2.7006,0.6364,0.9475,4.5966,0.5356,1.8867,1.4784,0.9197,0.0432,1.7482,3.9442,1.7965,0.3849,0.5596,1.9423,2.9022,1.6437,0.0362,4.4713,0.0697,5.1508,2.0973,0.6483,0.0078,1.1061,1.7822,0.7388,3.1522,3.4484,2.5393,1.7802,3.4377,2.1396,1.8645,1.6131,0.0215,0.4284,1.0666,0.1308,2.4198,5.6952,3.7796,0.4472,2.5104,2.9185,0.7504,3.8936,2.8929,1.4034,3.7261,5.0506,2.7564,3.4785,8.8179,2.6292,5.3822,4.0875,7.5128,10.9536,2.0157,2.1908,3.819,5.2348,4.5396,0.0013,0.9883,1.53,1.662,4.787,0.9926,3.544,1.057,1.5928,4.3384,0.6713,3.6728,1.8553,4.7398,0.8617,5.7297,0.5554,0.0046,0.084,0.5922,1.2966,3.8202,1.6405,1.6685,7.5508,0.4202,0.2434,0.7879,0.8168,2.2187,0.3668,3.5117,0.6092,5.35,1.6875,3.2922,1.4986,0.8599,0.463,0.7405,1.5766,1.5395,3.6032,3.6117,1.8393,1.1713,1.1897,1.5942,2.5065,3.7962,2.9075,5.0201,0.6688,1.8608,0.3055,2.4459,2.1588,7.0121,2.4165,3.7348,0.4913,0.3499,0.258,2.949,0.5545,1.6297,4.887,0.8658,2.0504,1.2326,1.6121,0.6815,1.7733,0.4231,3.3105,4.7238,3.5696,0.9781,0.2523,1.0941,4.8694,1.0795,0.8767,2.5921,3.7274,3.3738,3.1638,3.8726,0.3057,0.7047,0.3872,3.2062,2.7321,1.115,3.768,1.8363,1.3913,2.6533,0.8605,0.6969,0.2993,1.7675,3.88,1.0281,0.3685,0.4794,1.0634,2.2608,2.3979,0.7898,3.1229,3.9439,8.4604,1.4062,2.4508,1.4449,3.0728,1.5109,2.0811,2.1133,0.9537,5.9199,2.7141,3.6378,2.0091,2.7785,2.3245,0.6457,0.6595]}

'' There are no other books there. As they approach for the first time the books on the shelves, they are all blank. The man goes to a nearby shelf for a dictionary, looks up the word `` mind '' and finds the following : `` Mind is the seat of your inner being or soul. The mind is a container which holds all of the thoughts, feelings, judgments, etc. that pass through the brain. It is also known as the \u2018consciousness box.\u2019 \u201d As the man approaches to the book, it begins to move and its pages are opened. The book begins to read :\n\u201c How to Make Sure No One Is Reading Your Mind. That was not printed last night. I hope no one has read it yet, because it is not printed right now. The reason it takes an hour to print a paper is that the printer can only copy what the publisher provides. The publisher is responsible for providing the data, while the printer is responsible for copying it. If he should decide that you should have some new pictures or a story which is not in my book, he would have to send an order to the printer, which would likely take a day. Meanwhile we would be out another hour or two. Since the number of days, editions, pages, etc. for a typical book can be counted on a finger, we know that the average book would take about an hour to print. Sometimes for special editions that take longer or fewer months this may add several times the actual amount of time for making sure no one\u2019s reading their mind.\n\u201c In the old days book producers had to figure out how to get the biggest possible profit from every new story. A writer wrote a novel. To sell it, a book publisher would get the author\u2019s original manuscript and rewrite it as a book, with pages, pictures, and the price. This new book could be distributed to bookstores nationwide, which would advertise it. Then an independent bookseller would buy a copy of the book, print it, and mail it to the bookbuyer. The bookbuyer would have it copied and distributed to large book stores and to smaller ones around the country. Then the bookbuyer would make copies and mail them to the bookstores, publishers, etc. These would then pass the books on to their customers.","token_len":509,"entropy":[7.3022,6.7649,0.984,8.8996,5.8618,11.5416,4.9573,1.3585,11.1224,0.0649,3.8535,7.0538,0.0637,4.3424,0.5291,3.8079,1.4255,4.3158,6.1288,8.9726,0.617,4.1164,5.8102,4.0783,0.4638,2.2504,1.1602,2.8559,5.8747,1.8894,2.9503,4.7019,1.0436,2.6416,4.5096,0.6847,5.0959,0.9495,4.9615,4.1061,5.4339,7.6653,0.7706,1.6285,0.0382,3.1643,3.6852,5.3768,0.7406,0.4355,4.1047,2.1742,1.6357,3.4193,4.3772,0.6792,1.733,2.5017,4.6678,1.4992,2.7747,4.004,3.828,3.8374,1.2312,6.7052,1.7455,6.4227,2.5712,1.8413,1.5684,2.568,8.472,3.5957,0.3433,2.9699,2.3484,2.9942,5.0425,2.2825,4.6506,0.9904,1.7417,8.6642,0.2352,4.451,5.8627,3.1959,4.5656,3.4672,0.9346,2.5729,1.3072,0.6193,2.3467,7.039,2.9712,1.8021,1.7152,2.7477,1.4218,2.8648,1.3862,1.2464,0.3211,6.8092,0.3743,3.9443,0.6004,2.6494,5.8353,0.6395,2.0361,2.8023,1.0604,1.5403,0.509,4.4901,4.2714,0.0976,0.6604,13.7807,7.2941,5.632,1.1363,6.6767,1.1755,9.0703,5.9006,5.2667,6.389,5.1178,1.4788,1.1052,3.4426,3.3136,0.8995,3.3821,1.0811,2.5765,3.4117,0.1796,3.2065,2.6117,4.6109,4.1976,1.769,4.8273,0.7328,1.1589,2.0458,2.8389,0.1133,2.5908,7.4135,3.9017,6.9499,5.0167,5.6991,0.5597,3.3825,0.413,0.234,0.0717,0.8115,0.0342,0.2189,0.0051,0.4574,5.7883,3.6547,4.738,7.4124,7.1559,1.1822,0.5807,2.9242,4.1817,3.8339,0.0443,2.4936,1.318,0.7786,3.0387,2.8929,2.0873,1.2593,0.9028,2.7094,4.1265,4.8688,0.0737,0.2143,2.7098,4.9947,2.5419,6.3861,6.3636,0.5953,0.7336,3.7534,3.2667,4.8465,0.9034,2.0029,1.7821,3.14,3.2061,1.9671,6.1492,2.9527,2.1951,5.5039,6.1948,0.8862,2.0185,2.5416,2.7068,3.5676,0.0535,4.7775,0.764,6.1559,2.3074,5.7582,0.3877,3.7827,1.0728,0.4212,0.0447,4.8403,1.6982,0.5552,2.7526,5.9048,6.7789,3.5241,1.4963,4.2786,2.7088,2.8787,4.1981,5.6947,6.8956,2.197,2.7355,4.926,5.5664,2.0476,1.1232,1.9738,5.5031,2.2427,0.3587,1.1054,2.887,2.2657,0.7871,3.4244,4.4587,2.723,1.1305,1.1661,0.8347,2.1436,1.8781,1.2686,6.1591,1.8297,2.2604,2.6386,1.4791,8.2867,4.8127,3.2713,1.7881,3.9058,9.3124,2.6152,1.5622,0.8533,2.1238,5.4624,1.5683,5.3476,0.1377,5.1952,5.5814,10.8199,0.6911,4.3111,0.6158,1.2343,0.5419,4.619,2.1324,7.3912,1.3758,3.9942,0.7602,4.8118,3.0853,2.7183,10.1265,1.5279,2.2487,4.7929,0.6201,1.6376,3.205,1.5721,2.6954,1.5738,2.0712,3.4501,0.0248,0.6566,0.8853,0.6187,6.575,6.0765,5.9227,3.4898,4.1015,3.5476,2.752,3.8876,6.8006,4.5571,6.0879,3.199,5.5963,6.9762,5.409,1.6468,4.1695,3.0872,0.3027,0.2423,3.5101,5.7771,1.4436,1.0672,0.0536,17.1047,4.7281,1.7742,0.3551,3.9926,0.1998,0.4179,2.4899,4.1065,0.7316,4.8585,1.6785,5.2566,0.6486,6.3707,8.9569,2.5757,0.4616,6.3914,0.0925,0.8177,0.3757,2.9511,1.4053,6.9879,3.4566,5.5145,1.5897,3.475,5.4018,4.6507,1.4791,4.1653,4.4465,5.7644,1.0018,2.7761,3.0755,5.4712,4.2191,1.6062,1.5088,3.2275,3.1931,1.7284,1.4655,4.3576,1.694,3.2633,11.1328,0.6282,0.0657,4.7662,2.5561,1.6827,7.4968,0.3712,3.4782,1.7153,1.3323,2.8263,3.6388,6.5013,3.3659,3.7496,0.3837,1.5692,3.9224,7.2292,2.8054,2.9122,5.8113,1.236,3.2109,0.9992,5.0999,1.3937,5.0571,1.586,6.1927,1.5189,3.1507,0.8649,8.299,1.0187,2.422,4.5714,5.2193,4.445,1.0633,2.2643,0.3136,2.9188,3.8597,1.0635,1.3649,0.199,0.518,1.5557,4.2591,0.2593,0.8187,0.4744,5.6715,0.0776,0.4568,0.6233,2.7741,7.1852,0.2457,0.4788,1.445,1.1636,2.0749,0.0145,0.4732,2.8336,5.8413,7.2949,1.5854,1.2943,0.6872,7.8079,1.8773,3.3401,2.8459,3.3265,5.7661,2.6949,4.9715,0.0684,0.4963,0.3357,4.1746,0.9814,0.7893,1.769,0.0117,0.4138,3.872,4.9197,2.0807,4.782,0.1725,0.393,0.7635,1.2774,3.1817,1.9054,8.244,0.1611,2.9762,0.3154,4.0368,3.5151,2.6082,5.9756,1.275,5.0689,1.0755,0.0587,1.949,1.1125,0.7604]}

So when these guys do that to you, then you can\u2019t trust them. You don\u2019t know if they are telling the truth. They told me that he was a medic. Maybe he was on that boat. So what do the guys who know him do? I do not trust them. His buddy, that was supposed to take care of him, took care of his friends. He would say the same thing. So the question is. Do these guys know the truth. Or are they just making it up to be somebody.\nNow my friends, I cannot say why my job on this is important. I didn\u2019t have the most positive experience going into it. And I can admit that. So you know what? I get a lot of people telling me stories about their jobs. I get a lot of people that don\u2019t know the rules. I get people that do not know the culture. I get people that do not understand the situation. I get people that do not understand the process. And as you see that, you know what you are dealing with.","token_len":510,"entropy":[7.6762,2.5639,13.1752,0.4775,2.3683,6.6032,2.8486,0.7043,5.5384,1.8831,6.4262,1.1058,4.5091,2.4039,1.5021,7.0472,2.2629,4.972,4.8704,1.1102,2.8163,7.3159,1.1309,2.7072,3.9674,4.03,7.1328,10.2065,3.7441,3.0676,2.2253,1.3682,1.4185,3.4858,5.0783,2.0373,6.057,3.7663,0.7968,1.259,0.766,1.7933,2.4901,6.8334,0.2234,6.1253,1.3708,3.9438,3.6378,1.3499,2.8695,3.338,6.2608,2.695,1.4081,0.6653,1.7042,1.4166,3.0578,4.0194,0.3846,3.8748,5.4224,4.9208,3.5742,2.2491,2.4514,1.019,5.7819,1.5917,2.3955,1.5515,2.7861,4.0716,4.733,1.7395,1.4586,4.5177,0.5203,0.7465,0.7578,3.791,5.3264,0.0182,0.4001,2.4823,2.6365,3.0115,1.9211,5.3029,0.5408,3.5792,1.4337,9.6879,3.9536,0.4149,4.6318,2.9198,3.3421,4.8057,1.9128,0.7331,2.9186,0.5883,0.7353,0.2253,1.9339,0.0997,0.3567,1.1394,1.2788,4.6841,0.1799,1.3709,1.3281,2.0791,5.0669,0.9386,1.0563,2.665,3.0272,0.3998,3.1432,0.9455,4.213,2.9501,4.1514,4.449,1.5603,1.4301,5.658,0.6808,0.9323,1.8965,0.0469,1.0706,1.0755,2.403,9.1641,1.7886,2.3442,2.9178,2.7236,2.1353,2.1145,5.3874,6.8724,4.9797,2.5494,0.3544,2.3301,1.4376,1.8775,4.7674,2.9926,0.4031,4.2963,0.4739,0.736,1.1664,1.5684,0.1674,3.1333,1.2907,3.4111,2.2721,6.8572,4.798,1.6178,0.2568,2.0964,3.1857,6.5673,3.1247,7.8326,1.736,0.6978,2.7469,3.9206,1.8719,1.0911,5.7928,3.5414,3.234,0.4151,1.7544,1.1513,0.6514,0.1577,4.5987,1.0217,2.8369,1.6203,1.3097,1.2263,3.3059,0.3014,6.3704,5.1057,1.5532,6.1766,2.3183,0.2298,4.3506,0.7361,2.1552,3.5981,5.8034,3.165,1.8152,1.5733,0.0107,7.7451,1.0885,0.4314,2.9052,6.0439,5.1212,4.3111,3.3446,2.3749,4.998,0.4615,1.9445,6.3108,4.0267,2.2197,2.8492,17.0284,6.8847,1.7566,0.5308,1.2605,3.9671,3.2625,3.7496,1.9198,0.8873,3.3309,1.2689,3.0673,5.2832,1.9095,1.1784,1.098,2.9661,5.1715,1.865,4.1414,1.018,3.6261,1.7167,1.7536,1.0176,1.9975,0.4185,3.9256,3.5328,1.9367,0.775,0.0117,4.9441,0.8221,0.6311,0.6091,2.9266,0.8927,4.5647,4.7348,0.0117,5.8914,3.2664,0.6119,4.7689,3.8911,3.0118,6.2536,3.2955,4.7334,2.2215,5.1538,3.8308,1.765,2.9982,0.8369,3.2444,3.3441,6.1112,1.7347,4.0888,1.5926,2.3308,1.4672,0.3357,3.861,0.8369,3.4014,3.8436,0.0855,0.0045,2.504,0.5138,0.323,2.0785,2.8153,0.147,0.0627,0.0004,2.4575,2.5615,0.9161,1.0071,3.5167,0.3991,0.0213,0.6713,2.1841,5.4233,0.5705,1.9513,1.7511,0.9203,0.6228,0.7524,0.506,6.0927,1.1777,0.7777,4.7798,5.3498,5.1773,0.9022,3.9692,3.3866,2.4505,4.4874,2.6773,2.6565,0.6524,0.1542,1.847,0.7858,3.6505,3.8627,0.4707,3.6995,0.8164,0.2377,7.402,8.3464,2.4546,4.2409,2.2202,6.2656,0.0015,5.5819,0.7965,0.0074,1.7848,1.467,4.1361,0.1849,0.0015,2.0275,4.8536,0.5246,1.6639,4.3348,4.4918,4.0226,0.9975,0.4511,1.1518,2.3503,3.5054,5.4067,0.7488,4.5224,2.876,2.6286,0.6302,2.0814,2.9866,0.4102,2.6565,4.6625,1.7118,0.1702,1.2407,3.9844,2.7622,0.0369,2.501,4.5415,5.2579,5.6343,1.4672,4.2087,5.7932,3.9719,1.2402,1.8676,6.0537,3.2094,4.654,5.2382,5.4626,6.5705,2.0374,5.3005,2.4468,0.5007,0.9408,5.9664,0.3719,0.0669,0.001,3.3927,2.2292,6.7115,5.6378,0.9133,6.1317,1.4566,1.3168,0.1953,3.5962,1.0686,3.2646,6.1883,0.8598,1.7117,3.593,3.8646,2.0926,1.463,0.9233,0.7465,5.556,2.8433,0.4635,0.0695,2.6632,3.7302,0.1163,5.2546,1.0944,2.3898,4.5533,0.6403,1.5489,1.5286,1.0902,0.0249,0.0153,0.3375,3.929,3.5678,0.4814,0.0949,0.0019,1.4616,2.637,7.2645,0.726,1.2961,1.2911,1.8159,0.6199,3.5369,1.2242,0.8172,0.8871,7.5251,0.5066,0.9054,0.5033,0.328,0.2881,1.8085,0.3617,1.9631,1.1018,6.0811,0.2523,1.0174,0.532,0.2468,0.2416,1.7075,0.1934,0.6686,0.9661,5.1024,0.3152,2.2699,5.157,2.3141,3.0515,4.268,1.1741,2.6706,2.7169,1.143,3.9119,1.1589,3.6128,0.0043,0.4588]}

You may try to make it better by adding additional rules to it. Make a system based on one found in an old fantasy book. This means that it works by some universal laws but the implementation of those laws can vary. If you are inspired by an existing system, make changes to it.\nTake your character\u2019s personality into consideration when designing the character\u2019s character. For a given set of rules, some people might act very differently then others.\nTake a lot of care in how you present your character. You want to present your characters as beings, not as creatures. Your characters should look human on the outside, but look at every feature and determine if it feels like an animal.\nMake sure that you keep an eye on how your characters behave. Make sure they are not in conflict with one another. Make sure they aren\u2019t causing anyone trouble, not taking from others, or anything improper. Make sure that they have a sense of humor.\nTry to include all of your favorite elements with your game. These elements include history, religion, romance, fantasy, or whatever other elements you like. Add them to the world the players are in.\nYour character\u2019s background can make or break your character. Have fun with your background so it reflects who you are as a person.\nYou may get ideas to include in the background from different sources, such as fantasy books, or you can go to a friend and ask for suggestions.\nMake your game interesting. There are plenty of reasons for creating your game. You need to find them and include them in your story. Your world and your characters have to be interesting to your players in order to make them part of your world to come.\nIf you are starting out and finding it hard to focus on an original game, use some of the ideas above.

In this movie the Avatar has just given his life to a girl, his father is about to be killed and his grandfather is dying. His last wish is for him to be able to return to the land. This is how Toph, with the help of the Avatar comes of age to save the day.\nSo what am I saying in all of that? If a movie can make me feel sorry for the protagonists than that tells me something. The only part that I really did not like about these movies is the fact that there is not really a lot of action to them, the movie that gave me the most emotion is \u201cAvatar\u201d it was a movie that really let me feel for all of the main characters. I think the story of most of the movies are just good and well acted enough that it isn\u2019t a big deal but even so that would not really make me want to go back and watch a few of these movies again even a movie that I enjoyed only half a dozen times is still something to give a shot at.\nI wish that I could say something a little more inspiring because these are some of the best feelings I have ever witnessed on the big screen. I think that I could not find anywhere else on the Internet that really takes the time to explain this type of feelings. If you can get yourself to the theater you will see something that will take your breath away.\nIn addition that I will definitely make it a point to go back to these movies a few more times just because they are such a visual feast.\nPosted on August 24, 2012 May 18, 2013 Posted in Avatar, Books, Dreaming, Enlightenment, Movies, RPGs, Self, Spirituality, TeenagersTagged Avatar, Book, Dreaming, Enlightenment, Movies, RPGs, Self, Spirituality, Teenagers","token_len":510,"entropy":[10.5185,0.4221,9.9915,4.9674,7.9806,13.0844,1.4447,3.9905,1.5599,3.0782,2.3976,2.9976,0.6963,0.655,4.455,7.5204,2.6627,2.8934,4.5929,7.8317,3.666,1.8893,1.8295,3.004,1.7072,4.691,0.2432,2.2845,9.8153,3.8247,0.9067,2.2413,1.0062,0.9765,5.1161,3.7899,1.0508,8.5869,0.2472,3.2758,5.0567,2.0818,5.9873,2.1366,8.6851,3.7059,6.9615,4.5016,3.0317,1.2036,2.7904,0.5117,2.638,6.1895,3.605,4.1944,2.9397,0.014,0.0023,4.3614,1.9268,5.0953,2.7848,1.283,3.6043,3.7449,3.5308,6.4077,0.3407,0.4759,7.2555,2.6132,7.3144,5.0932,1.6691,10.346,7.6894,0.8601,1.0757,0.7353,1.9463,8.3031,5.1924,7.238,2.6064,6.5047,3.5473,1.2337,2.0756,2.6922,3.4964,6.9855,1.0187,4.0811,13.7811,5.5297,4.2377,3.7969,5.3397,0.0021,0.9194,8.5354,5.3469,3.0968,0.8497,4.5821,1.2428,2.0708,0.0734,0.5114,3.4219,3.509,2.303,0.7319,1.6691,3.1351,3.0088,1.1581,4.3816,5.7371,1.8326,4.1625,3.7315,4.8974,2.5098,2.1602,0.8579,3.0453,2.1253,5.0694,0.9584,1.6807,5.4316,3.8273,5.9817,3.1693,0.8782,1.5711,3.7103,1.502,1.134,1.8803,4.856,3.6149,4.038,4.4488,2.7658,2.5941,0.7262,3.9809,3.9131,2.4814,4.2926,3.4808,2.3222,4.871,0.0128,1.8684,1.4399,1.5021,1.3895,5.4257,0.7877,3.6747,0.9671,4.3037,4.1824,2.5974,0.5002,2.4089,2.5029,0.0826,1.8708,2.4592,0.0063,2.5089,0.5252,1.9614,2.6846,4.6765,2.9407,1.3942,4.5381,7.8782,2.6575,3.6392,5.2018,1.8185,0.5569,0.0127,1.6517,2.0246,4.9581,6.1137,0.0279,3.9994,2.3758,1.7293,3.2953,0.7758,2.1518,4.619,2.1481,5.0466,0.0197,1.5595,4.7978,3.2285,1.1251,2.5331,0.3122,4.5313,4.6927,0.9784,3.1713,3.0667,2.3236,1.5676,5.824,0.0318,2.0676,5.8298,7.6811,3.2628,7.9295,0.2408,2.5692,1.7617,2.5509,4.0449,5.1029,1.0274,2.1312,1.9052,5.496,1.6349,1.0056,1.2952,5.913,1.3254,1.173,0.8242,3.2534,0.0821,2.7962,1.0559,3.4443,2.6983,1.0465,2.0782,0.4077,2.5304,2.848,3.8819,3.4466,2.7176,3.5336,5.2186,5.6956,1.2843,1.2244,1.3925,4.9696,1.9679,6.8041,0.4052,5.6034,0.0008,0.6991,0.5817,4.6915,2.4834,1.9297,2.9546,0.6915,3.7782,4.8951,1.0333,1.4675,3.9264,3.1802,1.0074,0.7339,4.6656,0.1002,1.1341,2.0742,2.5693,2.122,3.9074,2.4482,7.2653,0.4591,0.7651,2.3494,3.4698,3.2267,4.6205,3.0092,3.3279,1.6848,5.8095,1.7982,1.7828,5.0475,11.1605,8.0298,2.1086,2.813,3.3593,0.6052,2.3142,5.3628,2.6625,4.9456,4.6678,1.6639,2.5691,2.1426,2.0895,2.9896,0.0986,2.8295,1.2493,1.2615,0.4797,3.1067,4.6684,2.0884,0.8935,0.4059,1.7719,6.4326,7.4113,6.4297,0.9084,1.9416,4.1872,5.7005,5.19,3.3518,2.1463,0.2267,3.1196,2.4774,3.583,2.4818,4.9385,2.1764,7.1536,2.4203,0.4063,1.1027,2.4123,4.6651,2.5647,2.0358,0.4974,1.1999,3.5867,4.8531,0.3214,0.8427,7.3039,4.3115,4.242,2.0346,2.4336,0.3762,0.3043,1.5162,8.5278,0.4875,0.3432,2.4133,9.0782,4.0221,2.5854,3.7896,0.012,0.5296,1.5783,2.6321,1.6621,2.7941,2.5817,3.9756,4.0976,5.0992,0.942,3.8648,0.8319,2.4876,1.1407,4.4984,6.0499,1.702,2.7671,0.1505,3.5197,3.3257,5.4996,0.0026,6.2938,1.9514,3.2601,0.7484,3.8213,3.3349,3.5595,0.7711,4.0557,5.0406,2.9233,1.3634,2.4422,3.091,1.1727,2.9916,3.9242,1.3744,0.8143,0.0023,0.6932,1.5776,4.3236,4.1131,6.236,1.6989,3.6921,3.3358,4.9812,3.0278,2.1044,0.4365,0.2024,3.9626,1.4129,1.5313,3.7696,0.5868,3.2113,1.1259,1.0938,0.0186,4.4901,1.3351,1.7144,0.877,2.9732,1.053,7.2488,3.1443,0.9223,2.4225,6.1698,5.2573,4.1055,3.3308,1.1133,2.1689,9.9702,3.7546,0.4533,1.4588,5.5992,5.306,5.491,2.602,7.662,0.5726,8.3309,2.0856,0.5729,9.5659,0.672,5.8178,0.515,9.8523,0.3116,7.1393,2.8451,6.2446,0.6245,0.2977,8.1457,3.398,11.6101,4.7917,5.8288,0.9034,3.7564,1.0015,3.1423,0.0596,0.0698,0.1919,0.0546,0.1503,0.0409,0.9111,0.033,0.0493,0.0319,0.0043,0.0002,0.04,0.0262,0.0126]}
{"prompt":"When you kill a king , you do n't stab him in the dark . You kill him where the entire court can watch him die .","text":"When you kill a king, you don't stab him in the dark. You kill him where the entire court can watch him die. The king is on the edge of his throne and has all of his power and assets. It doesn't take a whole lot to send a person to his execution. This is a very effective strategy to use when it comes to trying to keep an enemy in check. The same things that we do to keep our competitors in check should be used to keep our enemies in check. And while I think it\u2019s important to remember the power the enemy has, having it in mind would be very valuable if we actually thought about the power we have too.\nI want those power struggles to go on, until only one side remains. That side can then rule, when we have left only our children and grandchildren. The one side can dominate, when we have left only our kids and grandkids.\nI would like that world where all politics is run by the government and the government is run by the people. A world where political parties are not our enemy, but there are no political parties in the country.\nBut, we can\u2019t let that happen. It\u2019s very important to stop politics and politicians. And when they do not have what they are looking for because they are not getting what they need, or they will be angry with the people, who give them what they have promised. They will have to go to the next step and make the people angry and hurt.\nWe have a whole lot to do to get where we want to go. We have to change our entire world, our government. It has to be changed and it has to be run with one purpose.\nAnd it\u2019s going to take a lot of different things to do everything we want to be able to do for ourselves. Most of the important things we want to do, have to come from us. We cannot ever get there, unless we take care of ourselves first.\nLet me give you an example. If I was really excited to go on a vacation with my family. I would have to be very careful how much money I have in the bank before I started my vacation. I\u2019d have to be careful how much I spend on food and alcohol for the first week of the vacation. I\u2019d start planning out the money I have left after the first week, so that I am not left in a terrible financial situation on the last day of the vacation.","token_len":510,"entropy":[3.8043,6.9469,1.5525,7.7954,0.8109,1.0526,3.599,0.0005,9.3181,0.4353,2.4442,0.0286,8.5627,0.9385,1.2562,2.0075,0.5643,6.1802,2.7698,8.6238,5.6757,3.9584,5.4106,2.7003,2.9996,0.7955,3.1535,2.1543,1.6669,5.1317,1.1068,4.0157,0.2099,1.1512,3.4677,2.4086,4.7119,5.4624,2.2554,0.8404,3.9089,2.6448,5.247,2.5443,3.5117,3.1771,0.0003,3.529,1.9683,5.5801,0.459,1.6773,5.0955,1.8283,5.1289,1.2963,3.5247,6.2238,0.8421,4.4064,0.7141,2.0595,3.1532,4.105,2.7585,2.9683,3.216,2.6469,3.5622,0.507,0.0393,5.0137,0.0246,3.7347,3.0342,1.8113,2.3305,1.5106,0.4411,3.1873,4.5988,6.6955,1.2579,4.1174,3.0122,2.2247,3.9498,2.4186,7.3073,2.0212,0.1278,5.4011,1.0774,0.8496,1.1078,1.4069,1.5928,1.2111,0.7625,0.0706,0.4478,4.6555,4.4259,3.1395,2.4374,2.0571,19.364,7.0746,1.4525,2.63,0.5889,2.8541,3.5575,5.0616,5.1092,2.3985,0.5374,0.871,7.3594,3.5362,1.4293,5.8282,5.5885,1.2589,2.5415,3.7293,3.2173,1.2284,5.8564,5.9092,0.3866,3.0777,2.5177,2.5334,1.2829,8.6395,0.3715,1.358,7.413,3.5412,8.6138,8.038,6.0854,0.1752,3.1424,1.3295,2.4896,5.913,6.4228,1.6684,2.9864,4.9667,1.1275,3.0677,4.6798,3.1454,3.972,7.275,2.7576,5.7107,2.8801,2.1513,5.9283,6.6361,2.9375,7.2924,1.1829,2.2658,0.8402,3.0342,4.774,2.5117,1.4023,7.1083,1.5173,1.4286,0.5948,0.3187,0.8838,0.4358,0.6292,5.2458,0.3206,4.0688,0.2786,0.246,1.8579,2.2618,3.8313,1.1066,2.7029,5.8063,5.6206,2.6493,8.4518,1.1317,6.5711,0.328,1.6738,4.4715,1.93,1.8103,2.4409,1.5642,2.9822,0.0466,0.7252,0.5828,0.6157,4.7432,1.5712,0.2454,4.3929,1.1374,0.9207,3.3928,8.2647,2.8897,1.2677,0.9546,6.4034,0.864,2.5417,2.3665,0.0605,2.5723,1.292,2.7275,0.5211,1.8896,4.0675,2.8537,3.3098,2.2817,10.6495,0.6007,0.0525,4.6976,1.6108,1.7136,0.6593,3.2265,2.4937,0.0461,0.0314,3.5518,0.7271,0.8657,4.6686,5.043,2.222,6.0118,2.622,3.6512,3.7815,3.1851,2.5101,3.2591,2.5589,6.0092,0.617,2.7784,0.9177,0.0184,7.0972,0.8332,1.2042,1.6047,5.147,0.7157,0.0281,2.7558,0.5592,4.5381,1.7853,5.2956,3.0827,6.8226,2.7163,1.3993,2.4976,1.2304,5.8016,6.2559,0.3305,2.3523,0.015,5.0654,6.1373,3.7392,2.6181,1.8525,4.2426,1.8502,3.0912,1.4863,1.5682,3.8478,2.6081,2.1786,3.2824,2.8078,4.2031,1.8861,2.9068,5.7715,1.6328,0.9606,3.2085,2.0251,2.6431,5.2383,1.9434,2.132,1.815,1.8379,2.9715,6.1721,0.1616,1.9697,0.2267,0.7401,0.6287,1.718,0.6466,0.5306,3.7262,1.8123,6.0505,2.8014,2.0538,3.7853,5.1099,1.9137,3.3637,2.952,0.2376,1.4928,1.9171,3.2291,1.9856,0.2298,0.0079,0.4948,5.2568,3.6821,6.2294,4.1121,0.9246,1.3736,2.7317,3.1366,2.1679,0.0375,0.0101,2.8869,0.0313,1.6872,1.1535,0.447,0.3074,5.7261,2.1769,1.4402,1.7726,7.2495,2.1768,1.4072,0.6318,6.758,1.6867,0.0023,0.2009,5.1378,2.6959,0.4731,6.7044,0.6926,1.0405,5.8113,0.2768,1.7021,1.4491,0.2503,0.2826,2.8646,4.7512,1.0231,5.2067,0.6521,5.724,0.6109,1.6406,4.5011,5.9725,3.2928,1.8644,3.4675,3.4594,0.1848,3.3881,2.522,0.0739,1.0205,3.374,0.2531,1.0045,4.8827,1.5422,2.3335,0.246,1.2891,0.0843,0.8241,3.4062,1.8144,3.0475,5.8221,6.1463,1.9,2.3813,2.8865,0.8718,2.9432,2.7861,0.2448,1.0024,3.9826,0.9345,1.0238,2.3143,1.8757,3.6781,2.4827,0.9167,4.4509,3.2775,3.153,0.1762,3.8685,3.133,2.3957,0.1162,5.2671,0.3142,6.4826,2.3943,0.9845,0.2868,1.2219,8.5925,0.4181,1.0635,2.1858,0.1553,2.1607,1.8292,1.8485,0.102,1.483,1.2942,0.8754,2.13,1.3411,4.9771,4.5072,1.409,2.7219,2.8993,1.7581,1.1946,0.7833,0.3535,1.4934,3.5868,0.0544,0.3467,7.0191,5.197,3.3602,2.2502,3.9927,1.0963,1.8892,2.8014,4.5011,1.3327,0.917,0.1999,2.3003,2.8015,0.7992,0.5952,3.6351,1.2807,4.1179,2.8468,1.7813,5.078,3.5546,1.0889,4.865,0.9466,3.6501,0.5498,0.4358,0.6761,0.1886,0.1405]}
{"prompt":"The inner workings of a serial killer portrayed in the style of the movie Inside Out .","text":"The inner workings of a serial killer portrayed in the style of the movie Inside Out. It's the first feature I see adapted so obviously from the film, and it's probably the most successful. It tells the story of a man who has been stalking the people in his family for more than half a century and trying to figure out what made him become the killer that he is (the movie is, of course, set in the 1960s).\nIt's a fairly dark movie and there are a lot of scenes that are quite shocking. This is a true story too, as it was written about a real serial killer named Charles Sobhraj. Sobhraj is the man behind the murders in Kolkata of at least 16 women.\nOne of the most unusual things about this film is that the narrator isn't a man. He's a woman, a lesbian. She wants to find the killer and has been stalking him for over a decade. She's a very passionate, very persistent woman who isn't about to give up. I thought her story was very powerful (although it's hard to think about how long she's been trying without giving up) but also very realistic, because I've been there (and I've also been a target of a serial or even multiple mass murders for a couple of years now).\nSo she gets to where she wants to get to by following her brother's instruction to follow what is a male serial killer. She also gets to the conclusion that she must love someone to be able to commit these crimes. She can't be the type of person who murders people for sex. She must like them and love them.\nMy movie review from when I saw this film. This is an interesting film for me because it is set during the Spanish Civil War (1939-45) but doesn't really talk much about that. It\u2019s about a group of refugees who escape from the fighting and they have to get themselves together and sort out their feelings about one another.\nThe film stars Emma Thompson, Jude Law and James D\u2019Arcy, among others. I thought the part of a young woman who comes from a very sheltered and innocent family was really good, and I especially liked the part where they are trying to find a way to escape the chaos by trying to get to a country they can visit in Europe.\nI thought the story was a little predictable but at the same time it did seem very credible and very believable, so it was definitely an interesting piece of work.","token_len":511,"entropy":[9.3419,2.6419,0.1064,2.5336,7.0273,1.4056,11.4874,0.6862,1.2533,11.7181,0.1924,2.0228,3.5068,9.0625,1.3425,1.3888,3.8099,1.0356,3.0767,4.0816,5.1102,3.113,5.3298,7.4915,6.8281,7.0727,1.0326,0.9491,3.0256,1.4983,1.048,1.184,0.5619,4.6392,1.1237,1.2352,5.0051,1.8522,1.9203,5.4921,0.4527,0.3815,0.1192,1.2685,2.7853,0.5499,2.9813,1.2259,6.646,2.8706,3.8921,3.251,0.6395,3.6633,0.7744,3.2272,0.0027,4.0069,0.2226,0.0911,2.1717,4.5628,0.0487,3.851,0.0481,1.3916,6.0523,0.9457,4.5803,2.3299,1.6144,3.0977,0.7928,0.2541,5.8326,3.393,2.4485,2.0467,5.1729,2.0276,0.0024,0.0142,4.0226,0.4684,1.3153,2.9297,0.1229,1.0239,1.4525,8.104,0.4711,1.5011,5.4225,3.8207,1.8726,2.6444,2.9258,0.9697,1.45,0.843,0.025,3.8785,1.3745,1.2889,3.947,4.1019,1.2211,4.4756,0.7638,1.5256,5.2365,2.1925,6.7233,0.9215,2.9618,1.9881,3.4027,3.2278,3.846,2.2746,5.421,2.3546,0.0562,3.2814,3.8637,9.4291,10.4158,3.7808,1.9073,3.5791,0.0003,0.0022,1.4135,2.3337,2.4676,2.6813,0.6922,3.0646,2.5228,6.6285,3.0294,0.0001,4.5356,5.4375,0.0109,4.3253,1.6303,1.6712,3.1232,4.2742,0.4032,0.3474,2.0725,5.5353,1.4627,0.253,1.0717,1.3666,0.2088,0.943,1.939,5.3729,4.7484,0.0007,2.506,3.609,0.9991,0.8275,0.3666,0.7517,2.2538,1.771,2.7158,5.6892,1.7007,2.1036,5.9139,0.3914,3.9737,2.4621,0.6848,1.6262,3.705,1.9399,2.1494,0.7837,0.9615,2.2534,0.9858,0.7236,0.303,1.3315,1.4172,2.5719,3.3142,5.348,2.6941,2.6347,6.21,1.7303,1.4418,5.4102,0.0003,5.8183,0.273,2.3959,0.0509,1.075,4.376,3.8372,4.0274,3.0034,0.6874,1.6979,4.4906,6.4196,3.9394,1.8162,1.1494,3.489,0.1316,4.1731,3.3887,2.0784,5.1959,1.1633,1.3179,0.3797,5.7858,7.4034,2.9237,0.2052,2.6275,2.2847,3.5907,1.3485,5.6658,2.3722,2.6721,2.9769,3.2638,2.811,6.3357,4.2315,1.9363,1.9116,1.5469,4.2401,1.3202,4.1985,5.9026,0.3958,4.3268,1.6817,9.8681,6.0972,6.8581,7.857,0.7548,4.5006,2.6767,3.8324,0.065,0.4131,0.6151,0.9723,0.8023,3.8805,2.8954,3.9719,1.7539,5.8033,0.1589,1.5992,0.1117,4.8849,1.4525,4.568,4.6423,2.5835,5.3063,1.9382,8.8741,1.6889,3.2773,5.1746,2.8325,5.0558,5.8647,2.0885,0.07,0.8907,1.4063,4.2171,1.7797,0.1823,2.2249,5.5855,0.4285,1.1387,3.5289,6.1794,4.8618,2.7569,2.7536,1.0637,0.0011,4.7171,3.1254,1.2309,0.8296,1.9604,4.2484,0.4271,2.6405,2.4182,4.4544,0.6872,0.7189,0.4604,6.9965,1.5823,2.0687,3.9403,1.7721,1.0427,2.5714,5.7693,2.1179,2.4699,2.7414,0.2002,1.271,1.4742,5.4144,6.9547,6.0988,5.1225,5.6857,0.5473,2.4837,1.9426,1.8504,3.9014,4.4561,0.9728,3.5766,2.2811,2.7018,3.6866,0.805,1.031,0.7306,2.545,2.9149,3.8629,0.6123,8.1721,0.3634,0.0239,2.8816,2.0834,3.1534,0.4965,2.7589,0.8731,4.137,5.4927,0.0003,1.6152,4.6189,2.1045,0.0511,3.2639,1.2831,1.258,18.0331,8.3546,0.6063,2.671,1.3869,3.4568,0.0245,6.8886,1.1006,4.0025,1.3755,1.4801,6.2676,1.4349,6.1173,3.5021,1.08,3.9291,5.5994,2.3965,1.5079,6.4548,0.5446,0.9051,5.458,1.147,3.6382,0.0158,0.4377,1.7095,1.9756,2.6502,6.8259,6.4864,1.6634,1.334,8.0259,0.0062,2.4689,4.8587,5.1509,13.8586,1.4852,10.6808,8.0039,2.489,4.7262,0.2656,0.26,2.4258,3.4405,2.0639,6.5563,1.5171,5.4799,3.545,1.3794,0.7598,4.431,2.0449,0.6926,2.273,4.6424,2.2386,6.5779,1.1354,2.0263,2.5196,3.1225,1.7903,1.8944,1.3914,6.3992,0.3403,0.8708,2.991,1.0564,3.3473,2.5176,2.6087,0.0303,1.4674,1.4868,1.2762,0.6551,2.852,1.6577,4.51,5.2534,4.0115,0.0782,2.4868,2.7459,1.7336,4.8637,3.0395,2.9516,4.3154,2.9816,5.132,0.7669,0.873,2.2106,3.0562,1.2468,3.4813,1.0551,2.5467,1.8073,6.8819,2.5814,4.4621,0.3699,0.1607,0.0034,1.4754,3.747,4.2723,1.8774,6.6379,1.9144,3.2877,2.6995,2.8299,2.5843,2.3736,1.4741,3.9617,3.7859,0.5489,3.3214,0.203,1.3931,0.448]}

I'm a person who has been granted the ability to make such a machine. Is that so?\"\n\"Sometimes things can get out of hand,\" Teller said. \"You've got to keep your head when you're in a situation where you're dealing with science and religion. There's not a lot of room for rational discussion when it comes to matters of that sort. I know this because I'm a scientist and I also know something about religion.\" He gestured to me.\n\"How about we keep this rational, Mr. Taylor? What have I done to merit this visit to your temple and a chance at a time machine with which to send messages into the past?\"\n\"What do you have to do with it?\" Teller said. \"Look, I'm an atheist. I've said all along that my belief in God was a personal opinion. This is as far as it goes. Now, let's get this time machine together and take a look at it.\"","token_len":512,"entropy":[3.8359,6.3772,0.0721,3.624,2.7681,2.9977,0.0166,0.5787,6.9475,4.8726,1.8679,6.843,0.4104,3.2314,4.12,1.5502,6.8829,3.1217,2.1379,3.7986,3.2836,1.7458,4.3613,0.7756,7.9702,2.6685,1.581,5.6946,2.1911,2.9118,0.5184,5.142,0.7179,0.0412,0.0018,0.176,6.2647,4.9287,9.0738,6.9563,0.4353,3.6658,1.8472,1.2746,2.2839,3.816,0.4741,3.8506,2.4431,4.4279,0.0021,1.2404,3.0762,4.9198,3.2055,5.988,6.4508,1.8405,2.9324,2.5128,6.9543,6.2821,1.5651,1.6706,1.4473,1.2909,2.5934,2.6996,5.2212,0.0874,7.6147,0.3381,0.0796,0.4771,5.3099,3.3307,0.0007,1.723,6.8901,7.6689,0.5048,4.5565,2.6828,4.9722,4.9046,0.0071,2.8225,1.3191,3.8915,0.3425,1.4683,1.5916,8.0094,0.2256,1.9098,5.2393,2.9506,6.5783,2.7903,0.5726,3.5751,6.4285,3.3643,2.0612,2.6922,6.2489,0.2215,4.2849,6.4462,4.6079,5.238,3.3093,5.3056,2.9925,4.4751,4.9012,5.5677,0.944,0.5556,4.8194,1.5831,3.043,5.9025,3.0912,4.31,2.3959,7.0084,2.2402,0.6797,3.2743,1.1879,4.755,5.0783,0.6805,7.7223,2.773,5.0767,2.5835,5.9772,0.5904,1.6274,0.6025,2.8148,4.1607,7.4671,5.4854,5.6236,1.5176,4.3759,0.0007,1.31,5.1768,1.4933,1.9549,0.4544,4.2419,6.8944,2.621,4.5201,2.0156,4.5243,2.3512,4.6667,2.4143,4.6341,3.6274,0.9543,6.6162,0.2947,6.3585,0.1084,6.3081,0.3797,2.8882,0.9464,1.7566,1.3607,2.5618,8.5076,0.0277,0.4359,0.587,2.866,0.4973,1.9785,6.1607,3.2212,3.2917,0.4897,5.0325,0.6413,1.5524,0.2354,2.8629,2.2777,1.9385,3.6415,2.6103,1.1818,1.8487,1.1133,0.2641,8.3926,1.7226,4.4617,1.1648,0.4354,1.5548,7.3303,1.1467,0.6434,3.497,7.9449,1.765,0.2564,2.7713,0.0021,5.5493,0.0457,0.0089,2.7956,3.7637,0.2922,0.4489,4.181,1.9963,1.8957,4.5148,0.0006,1.2753,4.1496,2.7598,4.0999,0.1189,2.8327,1.0253,0.2499,2.6279,3.7809,1.3545,4.3424,4.4696,0.7467,3.3,2.5571,0.0005,6.2935,2.4335,1.0936,3.8244,0.8017,6.9302,2.0905,0.3788,0.9603,2.7242,1.92,0.1627,0.8519,0.776,0.1386,0.7771,0.6529,2.2052,3.457,0.0004,3.9025,1.7803,2.0339,2.6918,0.5619,6.3495,4.5479,2.726,3.523,3.9091,1.3337,0.0438,1.7483,0.1731,0.9552,5.8496,2.8447,0.3839,2.6329,1.8428,5.7332,3.4134,1.6876,0.7195,1.0098,7.6822,0.4144,1.2769,2.1195,3.5106,1.5028,1.0609,6.032,4.301,0.9731,2.5561,1.2729,3.0959,2.4986,1.559,3.9413,2.6799,3.3249,1.4639,3.843,1.5905,1.5838,2.9991,5.0708,1.1011,2.0563,2.3931,6.9247,1.7839,1.4361,0.0518,3.7097,4.6653,1.3082,0.7054,1.4203,5.5192,0.7156,3.7433,0.859,0.1077,0.6728,7.4346,4.7878,2.8501,2.6582,2.1411,0.0349,0.621,0.9137,0.7875,0.0002,1.0739,0.6458,0.2619,2.8663,3.0387,2.4468,0.4963,3.1484,1.801,1.7203,8.1462,1.0498,0.7761,2.8883,1.7858,1.4592,1.4219,0.7389,1.5526,4.103,0.0101,7.9778,2.2513,6.3026,1.1374,3.936,0.7828,3.6814,1.474,0.8325,0.5513,2.5743,0.4237,4.8388,4.0918,3.0507,1.3553,0.038,0.0087,6.096,0.3784,6.2138,1.386,0.9076,2.1438,3.6296,3.8257,2.8618,0.4617,2.702,1.5763,1.3456,2.6075,0.6665,6.9201,1.2482,6.0067,0.8241,5.6495,2.0101,2.843,4.4644,0.0046,0.9311,3.2184,1.0065,1.9519,0.4229,4.3429,2.8743,2.3016,5.4702,2.3724,8.4565,3.0791,5.2431,0.0044,0.7091,1.7901,3.6017,5.9176,3.2177,1.0458,1.6099,6.5186,1.7564,9.1026,2.8754,2.0327,5.9205,3.9788,5.1465,3.57,3.1694,2.1398,5.0117,1.5705,4.5335,3.2112,0.7134,5.4612,1.6926,4.6911,0.2695,0.8437,0.5116,0.3843,0.5071,3.7736,2.3265,0.2717,4.2888,0.6308,2.5087,0.8624,1.8378,0.3438,3.3531,0.0005,2.8121,0.4537,0.5905,5.8008,0.357,0.9687,1.2629,4.1263,3.2131,0.8412,0.6545,2.5031,4.6235,3.7809,1.5539,0.2008,3.4809,2.7042,0.5288,2.043,2.7656,2.3438,4.3242,5.1759,0.9701,4.7084,1.0432,6.0314,0.9527,0.2026,2.9227,0.1187,0.5946,5.2132,1.2318,3.5224,0.4461,2.5624,2.4303,7.2146,0.0332,5.0618,1.943,4.5496,1.4432,0.5055,0.2595,0.7373,1.7105]}

Math magic has many possible applications in every day life, we just have to discover them.\nThis week, our focus was on the impact on all species, of species. We found that when we care for and manage other species, we care for and manage all species \u2013 including ourselves.\nMy students have already shown much love of animals. So far, I had always used the term \u2018carnivores\u2019 but I found that in a lot of cases, people call me the \u2018cat lady\u2019. I was thinking that would be the most suitable name, so that I could not only be called the \u2018cat lady\u2019, but also the \u2018dog lady\u2019, the \u2018birdie lady\u2019 and the \u2018cow lady\u2019 at the same time. \ud83d\ude09\nThe cat lady: I have a houseful of cats and I am the cat lady to them. (They call me \u2018cat lady\u2019 without really thinking of the actual meaning of the word.)\nThe dog lady: I have a dog and I am the dog lady to him. (Even though he is very affectionate towards me, I keep remembering that my heart is already full \u2013 no room for another dog.)\nThe birdie lady: I have an orange parrot at home. I call her the birdie lady because she is a member of the family. (I am always remembering my birdies when I am out with my daughter, so hopefully she won\u2019t run away again.)\nThe cow lady: I have a goatie at home who looks amazing on her leash. I call her the cow lady because she is a member of the family. (I am always reminding myself that every cow owns itself.)\nNext week\u2019s focus will be on the importance of food production. You will learn how we impact the whole food chain with our actions.\nNext week\u2019s focus will be on the impact of species on species and I am really looking forward to discussing all that exciting stuff with my students. After all, the whole focus of my book is on what species care for and protect each other.","token_len":513,"entropy":[3.4603,12.9459,4.9454,1.8882,9.1959,0.9039,4.9448,0.6717,6.2921,1.9854,1.8681,3.572,8.8372,2.6113,4.0528,1.2075,2.0805,3.4234,4.0042,0.8583,1.2802,2.3296,4.5186,3.7058,6.3238,1.6611,2.7266,7.2032,2.7126,11.7533,1.6327,4.2164,14.184,13.8258,5.5468,6.1671,5.9016,1.3386,0.1486,3.1841,1.4746,4.0029,1.5552,4.1577,0.3795,0.0615,5.5016,1.134,3.4815,5.2923,4.8333,4.9533,5.0061,2.8883,6.2446,4.9789,5.2751,4.5835,4.9628,6.8478,5.9646,2.8023,6.9303,3.4353,6.4953,0.7234,2.9658,4.5375,3.7672,3.3839,6.3848,0.7029,4.6367,1.5121,2.9776,3.6569,5.4363,2.3965,1.7642,3.8132,6.2345,0.1096,1.5777,6.1333,4.2753,2.3809,0.0919,5.9416,2.1301,1.2285,0.9955,3.9491,5.6153,2.1932,4.9423,5.2509,3.3985,0.7039,1.566,8.6126,2.9231,4.8762,6.8078,2.883,5.3464,8.5316,4.236,2.1105,4.1249,0.6658,4.533,2.7892,7.7807,1.9869,3.6063,4.6696,5.4675,0.7442,0.5449,1.2403,3.6641,1.8454,3.0224,0.6079,3.6299,1.4825,7.8275,2.8834,3.1884,0.4129,1.9242,5.8065,5.0863,2.6409,4.0998,3.8627,7.3004,3.3956,3.0608,5.0811,1.8565,4.8139,2.6147,0.8664,2.0157,4.4693,6.4271,4.9156,2.4077,2.4258,13.4072,6.9976,5.6899,2.941,0.2319,2.1668,1.0471,6.6686,3.7053,1.8373,3.9198,1.2197,3.6204,2.809,3.1343,0.0155,1.8448,1.2318,4.4346,5.9617,4.7939,2.7846,6.9733,0.1476,3.5475,7.135,0.7997,0.2617,1.6515,2.014,3.3846,4.1742,1.9148,4.8719,0.512,2.8694,2.1476,5.2848,1.8278,2.2608,2.2591,4.3683,2.2202,0.6797,4.717,2.2487,2.673,2.7291,0.9501,1.3144,0.0096,0.5316,0.1975,0.9601,0.0114,0.7275,0.0666,0.7605,0.8084,2.1214,0.0047,4.0216,0.1908,0.0482,0.0118,2.4338,2.9676,1.7857,0.0023,4.8122,10.0294,1.0218,0.0139,0.004,1.7228,0.9509,0.6386,0.0027,4.618,0.7357,0.082,0.0034,7.4756,0.3225,0.0221,0.0106,0.1676,9.2737,0.8179,0.5349,2.4898,3.7314,0.0704,5.8456,3.2107,2.878,2.3282,7.3895,6.2474,0.159,0.4186,1.9188,1.9075,2.151,3.106,1.1922,0.0783,5.39,1.3465,0.4641,4.9426,5.4466,2.5924,0.1382,3.8603,0.1456,1.2034,1.2656,0.3051,0.0942,8.1565,4.0644,2.2794,2.6175,3.1616,4.3214,2.832,1.1869,0.6274,1.04,1.2839,1.3945,1.651,0.9139,0.0527,0.1092,1.0939,1.7278,0.584,1.6884,0.9379,0.6622,0.3752,0.1376,0.0693,0.0588,0.352,4.2028,0.0946,1.0773,6.0551,0.7631,1.8607,1.1103,4.5171,4.2912,0.0177,3.5421,0.3858,1.4677,1.6423,5.2657,8.517,1.3645,3.8613,5.2511,0.8552,5.4031,2.8641,8.3509,5.4556,7.4532,0.5348,6.0392,1.1577,1.4265,0.2477,0.563,3.119,0.0258,0.0806,0.0139,0.3482,0.359,3.7285,5.0684,7.4893,0.026,6.769,1.7517,1.8752,1.926,4.345,2.6576,0.5159,2.7927,0.1787,0.3864,1.4984,0.9574,0.9539,2.1424,5.5629,0.0114,0.7314,2.2563,1.9301,1.7012,1.8789,1.8745,4.2438,6.5301,3.2754,5.0476,1.9211,3.2345,0.4768,1.3049,3.7864,2.145,0.9829,6.0825,2.1574,2.2178,6.2792,1.7193,3.5661,13.1665,2.0598,3.4904,5.1547,0.2779,3.8717,0.9168,0.2116,0.5624,0.4495,0.0238,0.0502,0.2262,0.4805,0.3754,4.7069,11.5513,1.6733,0.2554,5.5274,4.5469,6.4882,3.6468,2.5409,7.2836,0.2774,1.5455,0.8039,0.1357,0.1433,0.082,0.0871,0.0685,0.3211,0.4999,0.8316,0.289,0.0022,0.1003,0.0714,0.1088,0.6969,0.9556,0.6458,0.1119,5.6461,0.5831,0.6251,5.0465,3.3199,8.1899,5.3148,1.0174,0.1539,7.735,1.6598,8.7731,0.5419,5.2611,3.091,0.972,0.2653,0.2005,1.2295,4.682,0.0806,5.3132,5.4581,1.1658,4.9858,1.4355,2.128,1.5787,3.5731,9.389,1.6991,5.3342,3.1793,1.066,3.9708,1.4271,4.0458,1.2422,1.4427,4.0309,0.2387,1.1059,0.0148,0.161,0.2734,0.0583,0.0296,0.167,1.0559,2.1395,1.0344,6.0264,0.9336,3.7735,2.1185,5.9436,3.2751,5.2409,2.0255,0.0135,0.0094,4.7957,3.6871,3.435,9.4496,2.117,1.7071,2.4619,0.2564,0.4958,6.0461,1.361,0.0893,2.8385,4.509,6.7104,1.3634,2.6041,4.914,0.5649,0.9656,4.4585,3.2128,5.8931,0.3962,1.3024,6.022,3.9887,0.0304,0.8021]}
{"prompt":"A cure for sleep has been found , by taking a cheap pill people no longer need to sleep .

You opted to continue sleeping and now 1 year after the release of this pill you notice that people are starting to act oddly. One of your friends told you about a friend of a friend who has been sleeping since the pill has arrived in store.\nThis is all based on the fear that the pill will be discontinued, this leads you to believe the fear that you will wake up one day and forget where you are and have no idea where you are.\nMy family went on an adventure 2 weeks ago to explore places and get in touch with the other side of me.\nAs the old men say we should not do things by half, so I left the city on the Monday for the last week, and headed to an area in north Queensland some 1.2 hrs away.\nOne day in the car was spent planning for the trip, deciding which places to visit etc etc. We ate at a local Chinese Take Away, topped up with noodles, chicken wings and tea.\nThis was a good plan! As the girls were asleep in the back seat I thought of the last time when we went there alone.\nThe old men say there is only one way to find out. They say things will be okay unless you take action, so I put my trust in them.\nI have not written about my family since I went on retreat with the old men the other week. Today I had a dream, of a child playing in the street, he looked to me and asked if I was from this world. I smiled, and said no, he is from another world and the universe.\nThis dream came to me in relation to a decision, which I thought would be difficult with the old man\u2019s advice not to give up, but to give in some ways.\nI still felt the need to find where I was, and it was getting frustrating there was no way to find anything out. The old men said we could never find the answer to why we are here. The only thing we can do is to stop and get in touch with ourselves.\nThe girl was a young child and had a friend, the little boy we encountered, his name was James.

I am in a small town, not far from the ocean, and everyone knows about it, mostly because in my hometown people are more accepting of a new lifestyle. In the city nearby I lived in they were very reluctant to accept people. There is also a huge gay pride in my hometown, but in this town it is usually a small one. In my old hometown we have also a gay pride but I have never attended yet.\nAt the party this year we are meeting, and as usual this is the last party I want to go to this year, because I am afraid that I will not be able to make friends or feel comfortable speaking openly. However, I had heard from one of the other attendees that you have to drink a few shots of champagne, in order to be able to speak openly.\nSo now I have to choose not to come to the party or to drink a few shots of champagne, with a feeling of guilt in my throat. It has been two years since I was sick, and in some way or another I have learned to deal with it so far. I try not to think about what is wrong and I am not scared anymore, but this still makes me sick. At home, however, I just keep thinking about what all people think about me, all the rumors, everything. All the bad memories that have come up over time, all the things that happened to me in the course of time.\nI am still in a little bit with guilt and regret, that I did not live up to my own expectations, because this could have been a good example for people, but it is just one life, and it should make no difference, how beautiful, happy and productive it is. How much better I would be if I was doing something else, maybe more challenging. This does not change the fact that I have lived my own life, my way, and that is all that is important.","token_len":514,"entropy":[6.8149,7.6822,5.6519,8.4844,10.2008,6.7125,2.7244,2.6248,5.4415,2.4337,0.3977,0.1134,9.1107,4.2408,6.2434,1.0163,4.4734,3.9821,6.606,2.4723,1.2516,8.7322,0.001,1.6214,6.44,5.5301,9.0067,2.8543,7.6137,0.1162,1.4972,4.2584,12.3795,0.0682,2.3884,2.9129,2.3609,3.3423,1.4662,3.7595,1.7644,4.8558,4.1696,5.0439,2.6493,2.4613,1.3164,4.7274,14.5265,13.0447,2.4588,3.6662,2.5103,4.8444,3.9031,9.2127,6.7471,2.7971,1.4844,5.4271,6.6301,4.3753,4.5758,5.0513,4.8623,5.9717,9.0076,6.8072,6.6579,1.1232,3.8748,10.6679,3.6057,1.2754,4.5855,4.1935,0.1341,3.9216,6.2596,5.938,3.8854,5.63,1.4859,2.3042,4.0635,3.6628,0.1206,4.7713,0.4471,5.0191,3.8602,3.3529,5.2286,4.1828,0.0264,0.0011,0.0031,3.4602,4.8313,4.6721,0.6354,0.5804,1.4771,6.6412,6.8089,6.9243,2.644,2.24,5.4367,0.5832,1.2923,2.5071,0.7516,4.2715,4.4586,1.9071,1.0154,2.2172,4.3405,5.1043,1.0423,2.086,1.2087,1.4422,1.6876,4.0835,1.8688,5.2407,1.6196,2.593,3.6006,1.6641,0.051,1.7515,6.2956,0.9142,1.093,5.7865,2.2813,3.6161,2.2846,1.6995,6.0227,0.6124,6.0362,1.6593,3.4154,3.7415,1.8923,4.9327,2.7051,0.5,5.4955,4.1316,4.7344,1.306,4.0265,1.836,3.5616,9.582,1.4285,4.1007,2.1753,8.1379,2.1175,2.0431,7.0212,0.1651,3.497,2.9774,3.1793,3.9756,1.9697,3.2432,0.7534,4.1473,3.9119,2.7009,6.4469,2.7362,1.5409,1.3719,2.0941,3.638,3.1315,1.4133,1.9422,0.5418,4.4468,2.7131,2.6717,4.5233,0.793,3.1171,1.797,4.3642,2.9715,4.1234,2.8604,4.7103,2.5589,1.5627,0.3496,3.5769,2.6381,2.3305,1.1529,5.0917,6.3918,0.8132,1.6629,5.0357,1.1909,6.1851,4.9267,1.2908,3.2051,3.8604,5.6161,4.9513,2.2728,4.3568,2.3966,4.6046,0.8766,2.1639,3.0386,3.8779,1.3743,4.3309,0.1342,2.105,0.4972,4.9118,0.6095,1.9597,2.1626,1.2017,1.7626,3.3249,1.0959,1.8187,0.6192,1.3898,0.8776,0.2642,0.0056,3.868,2.5398,4.0354,4.7217,2.421,6.6404,3.816,1.5516,4.0323,0.6741,1.1807,4.3971,3.9108,2.8637,4.4309,0.4393,1.4269,3.0311,4.0815,0.4888,4.4801,2.8971,2.7129,6.8886,2.215,4.4569,4.6168,0.3778,4.402,2.6281,4.9431,0.6527,0.1183,1.7777,1.3538,0.0056,2.6023,0.5353,0.6982,2.159,3.5459,3.5896,1.0436,2.1354,1.137,5.211,6.6326,0.0547,3.6936,1.2706,1.4193,0.3682,3.7657,1.9551,3.27,2.3997,1.751,0.2683,0.3195,0.0414,1.5898,5.9892,2.4541,4.2226,0.7845,3.929,4.5292,0.0736,3.7366,0.6575,3.3761,3.7742,0.9024,4.0619,0.9803,0.3788,0.5137,2.3582,3.5065,1.095,0.999,3.8751,5.1807,2.0692,6.2175,0.257,0.7318,1.2637,4.3853,1.1604,3.7993,0.0328,1.857,5.7922,5.3109,0.496,1.3512,5.8896,1.5875,0.0071,1.8858,0.2971,3.1269,2.2618,2.8345,2.6442,2.5211,2.7593,2.1599,4.0422,3.0357,1.4096,1.4329,3.5383,6.9346,3.4906,0.171,3.8993,0.8418,4.9644,4.4391,1.9377,5.8045,0.0949,0.459,5.04,3.4124,2.1938,0.6679,2.1672,7.0421,5.0838,3.0846,1.1738,0.2805,1.1761,5.6518,1.1439,6.4976,1.416,3.1864,1.1428,4.9699,1.2334,4.8684,3.4559,2.2064,2.2029,1.9043,2.7584,3.9447,4.0754,1.2062,1.4589,0.2966,2.6501,0.4033,3.0776,1.6543,0.18,2.4864,1.2962,6.6121,0.0037,3.1261,0.8849,1.3356,1.4598,1.8821,2.876,2.6405,1.5374,3.6777,1.0202,7.7423,8.547,1.9577,3.2841,1.1816,4.2565,0.7941,1.9247,0.4948,4.2232,0.4246,0.0122,0.5393,4.6153,0.1951,1.3605,3.3103,3.9653,5.2374,0.662,0.4425,1.9396,2.6314,6.1774,1.5313,2.8143,2.6622,1.8395,2.1659,1.2919,3.6739,3.2869,6.837,2.2144,1.0436,2.3604,4.8787,5.931,3.2404,0.3306,2.8613,5.4205,8.0163,3.6785,2.7223,1.8157,6.6779,3.1584,0.4911,0.8643,6.2915,2.0291,3.5474,2.1358,1.7224,2.0158,0.888,0.3797,2.8304,5.6726,2.2052,3.4106,1.3777,5.4862,4.0316,6.0114,1.5494,4.0206,5.1123,0.0963,3.99,1.4183,0.1474,0.0524,0.5764,2.0944,4.3004,1.3548,5.5665,0.113,1.0975,3.9065,5.5217,1.3452,1.1963,2.101,2.4434,3.2723,1.8598,3.201,0.901,1.0587]}

One man said \u201d There is no point of keeping such a beautiful body as yours and end up with nothing to show for it, don\u2019t kill yourself, come with me\u201d The man didn\u2019t budge and he stayed. The other wanted to have a say to it, he was going to argue the case but then he saw through his brother\u2019s eyes, he realised that it wasn\u2019t going to end up in a win for any of the two. He went and he said to his brother \u201d You are right, there is not a point of suicide, you could have been killed in an accident or robbed at home, your pain and misery would have been far less\u201d\nFor my experience, suicide has no importance at all, even it we are talking about anything related to our selves. If we love somebody, why do we have to take their life even if we are in the right, we can\u2019t kill ourselves the right way, we don\u2019t even know how. If we want to, we can commit suicide the wrong way and even worst, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to give back the pain the person was going through. This is wrong and I am so glad my brother listened to my point of view and realised that it\u2019s not worth of getting to hell.\nSometimes, the world takes a bad turn, a lot of things happen like your parents getting sick, death of a very close friend or if you have a bad relationship, these things should leave us no choice and should end our lives because of them. It could be a relationship too, my point of view if two people split up, it\u2019s best for both of them to be happy and finish what started.\nI don\u2019t judge who commits suicide, but I do think that it must have been a horrible thing to do. I think there are more serious issues to worry about and we shouldn\u2019t waste our time on something that has no importance.\nThe second topic was\u201d Do you think we should be doing research for new drugs \u201c?I\u2019m really pleased for the answer of these questions. I said \u201d Yes, we should be doing research for new drugs, but how about those old medications? Are we still doing research for them?\u201d","token_len":515,"entropy":[7.2455,5.7695,0.7741,1.0941,6.3343,1.985,7.2207,0.9319,1.386,4.4342,6.2897,4.5828,4.7694,13.6767,1.8412,2.8719,2.157,6.797,2.9164,4.1027,0.1988,0.4423,4.2787,5.7225,1.164,1.6421,0.0116,8.1181,0.0331,5.415,5.1457,4.2756,5.3468,1.1367,3.4596,1.7224,3.1067,12.5857,9.2005,7.4229,1.6041,0.91,4.0716,3.2657,6.3236,4.7804,0.9739,7.3558,5.3128,3.7865,2.8335,3.3323,8.6122,1.4207,1.8341,4.1794,2.8737,1.5531,0.3045,0.035,2.608,5.4148,8.4911,8.3671,5.5499,4.5171,1.4941,2.3635,6.445,3.0494,1.5372,1.8112,4.5723,5.1123,2.9798,5.1977,1.4496,1.5396,0.0444,7.6534,0.0092,1.4103,2.703,5.1311,2.8666,2.1187,1.7168,6.1911,0.238,4.372,1.6915,5.9082,5.0543,1.5129,1.4667,2.1836,2.7117,4.2291,0.1499,7.1927,3.9266,1.5723,3.1101,3.6131,1.3509,4.7226,6.8077,1.8804,5.5765,0.8436,0.5337,3.0073,2.1849,2.5153,1.0643,6.1727,1.1975,2.5511,2.1372,0.7347,0.1236,0.0165,4.2313,0.0535,2.779,1.7788,2.4951,1.9841,8.6419,3.1098,5.9735,0.8365,1.7117,3.0728,1.7907,1.9911,3.0977,3.1871,5.3534,3.5647,2.289,1.331,0.4593,1.4393,0.1561,4.1049,2.3289,2.9672,0.808,3.554,0.6033,3.7506,1.4274,3.0902,1.6021,9.5375,1.9256,1.7531,4.8049,1.3962,2.9853,2.4247,3.4221,4.5195,0.6439,2.931,8.7453,4.4732,6.2555,1.873,4.356,7.3169,2.5216,4.5733,1.6566,0.6044,0.4933,3.9482,2.0891,7.3358,5.6003,2.5932,9.1781,4.8164,6.9106,1.3645,6.5906,3.401,3.5645,6.7824,3.9445,0.0619,2.0534,4.2327,6.9521,8.0459,2.6194,2.9301,0.0592,9.2223,4.882,0.0308,3.4958,6.8351,1.0319,3.4158,1.5626,6.8436,5.3982,1.2066,4.8185,1.8266,0.2344,3.4272,0.2483,4.1027,1.8183,0.8641,5.8464,0.6772,1.4675,2.1036,3.8665,2.8015,3.208,2.8401,2.1462,2.6607,5.0913,0.1999,0.0164,3.6091,1.2166,6.7105,5.7093,0.0624,1.6845,1.656,2.9437,0.2012,0.0297,0.0232,3.7393,1.2221,1.9298,3.9781,2.7875,0.645,2.1604,0.2409,3.4285,0.8038,1.3679,6.7529,0.2782,5.8258,2.9376,0.0032,2.1146,4.0963,9.8175,2.3266,4.1923,3.879,0.1125,0.0537,0.0281,2.6051,3.3736,0.6292,0.0136,4.9179,6.5975,2.9446,3.6621,6.0463,2.7218,3.3844,3.0694,0.0079,1.085,3.8315,0.6629,5.9864,1.8292,2.7173,3.0128,3.7581,2.7817,3.5834,0.8221,7.0773,0.3072,2.184,4.5417,0.931,0.043,1.2334,5.3898,0.7074,1.7789,2.5591,0.0172,0.1069,1.2826,2.6256,7.8575,6.2242,4.0937,5.9013,2.0211,1.0597,6.5968,1.9022,3.3092,4.8546,5.3705,1.8946,3.5937,1.7042,1.7159,4.157,3.2422,0.2235,2.7126,1.7209,6.401,6.1452,2.722,4.4917,3.2622,1.1999,6.0943,3.2234,1.3546,6.1576,3.1364,0.4787,1.7231,4.9637,0.4364,2.3609,1.0674,3.1074,2.439,1.2487,6.8336,1.3799,6.2926,5.6393,4.4825,3.8137,0.3438,4.8002,4.8202,3.9957,2.4481,0.2663,4.9244,1.8431,3.104,0.2554,2.958,4.2719,0.8276,2.2581,4.5169,7.6292,1.2922,5.0083,7.2128,0.8001,0.0307,5.266,7.0286,0.6426,6.9959,0.959,1.589,2.6757,4.4872,0.0219,0.0453,6.0928,2.6118,2.4228,0.6765,0.3152,0.3086,2.9368,1.8144,1.2131,8.4432,3.3745,4.466,2.2073,1.5887,2.2112,3.0268,0.325,0.0342,0.0102,7.7382,5.4612,5.4961,0.2179,1.1521,2.448,1.457,1.3737,2.4954,1.0788,1.9103,4.6695,2.4887,1.5023,1.9623,4.3006,2.4062,1.0786,0.7129,1.9218,1.3905,1.8379,3.5795,1.7865,4.3524,5.8892,2.5378,2.8055,4.0092,0.0205,2.5573,3.3303,4.5597,0.1655,0.0166,0.0172,5.3746,0.9299,0.2756,1.9455,4.0544,0.8668,3.4331,0.8026,3.3581,1.2495,1.3309,3.3472,4.6842,5.8079,3.1549,7.9943,1.7798,6.8495,0.9489,1.6649,3.3996,0.7367,2.5089,3.288,6.1954,3.5731,5.1378,2.9895,7.0325,3.5099,3.7473,7.3611,2.811,0.3036,0.5625,4.6072,6.8638,4.6041,2.142,3.4527,3.2956,6.5668,3.5199,1.3732,1.5513,6.1521,4.1145,0.7286,4.294,0.361,2.1583,0.5147,1.4936,0.6681,0.4633,1.4629,0.4327,0.1691,1.4404,1.9251,4.6874,2.6713,5.4859,5.2888,4.3148,1.575,4.1837,1.9657,4.457,1.7661,0.8058,1.2877,2.2111,0.5827,6.9205,1.2035]}

He was one from them now but until today they were still unaware. He wanted to stay hidden for a while more and let the tears come but he wasn't able to.\nHoney was the only one who was able to save him. She helped him dry his tears and said '' you are not alone. I am with you '' And Honey took him into her arms.\nJungkook closed his eyes tightly and tried to swallow his cries. He wanted to cry for a while longer but he couldn't. His voice was screeching in his ears and his mind was so blank. He only knew he needed a good cry tonight.\nShe grabbed him again and she kissed him. She kissed her on the cheek and slowly opened his jacket. The shirt she was wearing had long sleeves. One hand was caressing Jungkook's head and the other was moving his shirt.\nJungkook opened his mouth and said in one long breath '' Honey. Honey, Honey. '' He then opened his eyes and turned around and looked at her.","token_len":515,"entropy":[5.2847,2.3698,3.1564,5.602,1.7151,0.8696,6.4572,2.8401,0.6068,4.0198,2.6535,3.7423,1.9576,6.8929,4.0617,2.3974,2.76,3.529,5.0791,1.2524,10.0113,2.8466,9.1274,5.5073,6.6003,0.3824,5.3371,6.1921,2.5271,3.2355,1.9813,0.1591,8.9483,2.1851,0.1129,0.4555,1.1985,2.5061,3.0666,2.6514,2.5475,0.6769,1.8899,2.0021,3.1052,3.1162,4.0936,7.4643,5.8703,1.2584,0.573,1.5615,1.4595,2.8637,3.4038,2.5531,5.212,2.7949,2.0146,6.1666,1.3373,2.1638,2.4709,7.6226,3.4422,1.2463,4.4113,1.4673,2.7346,1.5099,0.1299,2.1087,3.8496,1.8394,4.2027,1.955,3.0121,6.9718,2.5875,3.863,7.8096,2.2377,1.9331,2.9308,3.2796,1.0042,4.5672,1.2913,6.0324,3.0361,1.3645,3.6429,1.4345,8.6373,0.7499,6.5079,1.5355,2.7569,4.7598,2.3226,1.6386,0.496,0.8593,4.831,1.4073,5.9028,2.6643,2.8029,1.5921,0.4569,6.6383,0.0619,0.003,2.5375,6.8157,1.9702,4.5003,3.7915,5.2879,0.1204,0.0752,0.2906,5.0198,1.0109,2.2911,0.0011,3.5343,2.9148,7.0489,1.9103,5.1347,0.7571,2.5881,1.2261,0.1446,2.2874,3.8412,0.9285,0.8814,2.9082,2.0788,4.0898,2.6342,0.7684,6.7244,3.2676,0.9664,1.2868,0.6269,1.3939,0.6644,4.1406,8.8837,3.1596,0.4781,5.2971,0.5396,4.0158,0.8902,3.3567,0.9158,1.2059,3.0737,4.3188,0.5152,0.0134,0.1334,0.7365,4.886,2.5339,9.3423,2.4266,4.9859,1.7488,5.9711,2.048,1.2346,3.9596,0.426,3.4205,3.5136,2.2565,2.4435,4.3513,6.3006,2.5172,5.8169,2.1429,5.5655,0.7218,1.3824,1.9498,5.7537,1.0223,1.6437,1.4615,3.2428,0.1856,3.723,2.2678,1.6397,5.6334,0.0004,4.5678,1.6534,2.5227,3.4854,1.435,5.1497,0.7621,1.1027,2.5706,4.0721,0.0006,1.8685,1.7733,2.7767,0.4772,4.8893,0.4664,5.5376,0.4025,1.9421,1.1744,5.1969,1.727,5.111,2.6643,1.7252,2.188,1.1457,4.732,3.2323,0.1123,3.8911,2.1837,4.1712,3.9901,7.1188,3.8384,0.4302,1.5772,4.1912,3.0896,1.1756,5.5826,0.0001,3.6104,4.1367,2.6925,3.3997,1.3093,2.9521,5.1574,0.2207,0.2177,3.1499,1.8198,4.5109,4.4861,0.3168,1.8935,5.5828,0.2695,4.4054,0.4915,4.6436,5.9033,3.0996,2.9787,3.3868,0.0677,1.4569,0.8247,4.0218,3.6266,0.9061,1.2677,2.4434,3.7685,4.5229,1.9944,0.025,0.017,2.2897,3.0768,0.0208,2.5334,2.2715,2.4258,4.0771,7.1205,1.2474,5.4361,1.497,3.9882,0.026,1.7998,1.9986,0.333,3.2359,1.5616,4.8151,7.9131,6.3067,4.233,2.4367,6.7794,2.3359,2.3577,1.5334,3.4006,5.4328,1.843,2.5299,4.5049,0.3135,3.8225,6.0868,3.2691,1.8401,0.9078,5.2572,2.1005,5.679,1.7662,1.4661,2.9981,4.08,1.1676,3.3501,0.0007,3.2556,0.0366,1.1522,0.9368,5.962,5.26,2.7268,3.9199,0.9533,1.3842,0.9509,2.6976,2.5885,0.0037,5.0212,0.3785,0.715,1.4605,4.0395,0.3232,7.6706,1.255,0.5486,0.9178,5.0801,5.6004,5.5227,2.3034,2.477,4.1049,0.7401,2.0345,2.1599,3.5877,0.1142,4.9746,5.8118,3.5219,3.9246,1.529,2.9989,0.9004,0.1922,1.4665,0.9178,1.8881,0.0149,0.0049,0.0044,5.1683,0.0989,0.048,5.0259,0.6798,4.2948,0.1452,5.7052,1.6501,8.6415,1.021,1.0137,3.5971,0.2623,2.3843,2.7619,2.3429,1.0563,2.9336,0.2801,1.2127,0.6137,0.0005,0.8719,3.2342,4.9377,0.6488,10.0436,0.0403,2.9698,0.5549,1.2398,1.2172,1.8387,4.2567,0.3135,4.8123,2.3016,1.0015,0.8593,5.5296,1.8333,2.4264,3.3505,2.5211,4.2854,1.2095,7.956,0.9403,1.074,4.7487,5.3,1.042,6.2404,0.3949,2.9821,3.1957,0.262,1.7396,2.3608,2.5872,4.7138,3.1658,0.0795,1.4456,0.4727,6.3004,3.9519,1.2131,9.2398,0.8793,3.1583,4.6152,4.022,1.5369,0.1258,2.5593,4.3321,0.8588,2.8064,6.1657,3.9651,0.6257,7.1216,0.1374,4.8245,0.0038,0.0063,0.0363,3.3291,1.0512,0.6131,0.0171,0.3401,5.3889,1.0158,4.3822,1.5337,1.8437,1.1568,0.0011,0.0011,0.0046,3.6093,0.256,2.3963,0.7818,2.648,3.9355,5.7444,2.9747,1.4328,2.9002,5.0129,3.1628,4.0329,1.232,5.8225,1.1721,3.6956,1.485,5.7172,2.9356,0.1889,1.1356,0.6628,5.3209,2.2864,1.3677,1.9748,0.5612,1.403,0.7454]}

The orginal four must come to an agreement on who will remain a horseman. Who will ride this horse in 2015?\nMy best ideas and thoughts often take place in bed when I'm exhausted but awake. It's hard to tell how far along this idea came from, but my mind is already trying to put it all together. Thanks for all the feedback so far.\nThe concept has a bit of room to grow. I will keep the core idea in mind and see what the future holds in January.\nI am working on a story. I've been brainstorming and came up with some amazing ideas, but when I start implementing them I feel like something is missing. The part I am not getting is how to approach the character development in the story. This idea is very unique, but it needs my best efforts. Any suggestions?\nI've also been trying to get a sense of how this idea would fit into the history of the world. I like that it's very unique, but I don't know how it would fit into a more realistic fictional period in the world. Also, it's hard for me to give this idea away too much without giving it away too less... How do I tell my readers what's going to happen without giving it away? Thanks for all the ideas.\nThanks for your reply. I'm working on making my character come alive more, and I'm getting the story and character bits from an outline. It's kind of making me lazy at the moment when it comes to adding in details. It doesn't make for a good story to tell what you're gonna do next. It can be very good and unique enough to hold the interest, but I don't want to do it. Any tips?\nI want to give the audience all the information they need for the best outcome, but also to keep things believable. I want this to be a realistic read, but I can't be afraid to take care of making it believable to the audience.\nI will definitely think about how to make the characters more human. Sometimes when I write, I try to make the characters think about things I wouldn't normally think about. It allows them to truly stand out from what other novels are doing. Thanks for the suggestions.\nI have a few different ideas for the story. I am looking for someone to create a concept to start from.","token_len":515,"entropy":[2.9697,10.0879,0.8409,0.5636,1.5699,7.3621,0.1958,4.3472,11.4351,7.7502,1.8178,0.4775,3.0835,9.6013,2.4571,2.1284,0.7526,6.1283,4.0551,12.1951,2.4849,6.6782,1.9661,0.3602,0.0041,0.12,4.4014,0.6236,0.266,6.226,0.0889,3.1571,2.0804,12.3869,2.2953,7.5541,5.2712,5.3337,1.236,1.6781,1.9406,1.7549,3.5068,1.3009,5.5463,3.9682,5.6262,0.7614,2.0428,6.0609,0.5318,6.5888,4.7378,1.0894,3.7429,8.3873,0.7036,2.0574,8.1303,5.7563,7.6645,4.2711,4.1321,8.8042,4.7245,2.4624,0.8967,8.6009,4.6093,0.5892,0.9267,5.2264,4.7536,6.5113,2.0059,3.1995,0.61,3.5738,0.338,3.7233,3.2124,3.3866,2.991,3.214,6.6789,5.7848,1.4306,1.6528,0.5252,3.669,3.7495,1.8459,4.1259,4.8091,0.3104,4.8962,1.2622,1.7713,0.0961,0.5042,6.8626,1.5509,4.5625,0.851,3.1101,3.7265,0.034,1.1656,0.9925,2.9916,5.5733,4.0304,3.1085,4.4077,0.1996,7.5827,1.4715,0.7632,1.1888,1.8343,4.5122,3.0596,3.5833,5.8576,2.0317,1.7782,0.6591,2.1908,3.6748,0.98,2.8414,2.7089,0.1445,3.6133,9.1597,0.6907,1.3118,2.6446,2.4978,3.8202,0.2945,1.1625,4.3616,4.4153,1.5396,3.747,1.363,5.0099,0.0003,2.5278,7.6176,0.1042,0.0127,2.2075,5.1986,0.1891,2.6243,0.8625,5.2656,0.8976,3.6056,6.8483,1.892,1.3401,4.4391,0.4837,4.8737,1.3217,0.4963,0.4406,2.9707,7.2705,1.439,2.9088,4.6985,4.202,0.7884,3.5312,0.5891,5.5407,1.1004,4.2391,3.1511,3.0519,1.5919,2.1069,0.6352,3.5689,4.8917,1.2708,3.6717,5.4208,1.8276,0.9682,1.9413,3.3916,5.4339,5.2396,2.2055,0.7533,5.8712,2.0305,1.6014,0.6656,1.5869,2.8866,4.3805,0.8738,3.3923,0.1705,2.4482,2.0233,3.365,0.2198,1.6702,3.6816,2.2743,2.4614,1.7311,0.7387,0.5277,7.0498,0.169,0.9385,2.8682,0.8649,1.4066,4.5487,2.3177,1.7907,1.4548,3.7469,4.4529,1.5831,0.6126,1.0568,2.1849,0.0006,1.4742,1.1775,1.8979,1.1423,0.3515,0.3516,3.0164,5.231,3.6816,7.2462,8.2526,3.6582,1.0655,2.6888,0.3337,5.1219,0.3015,2.6311,0.9078,2.9407,3.0453,0.0998,0.0439,4.6349,4.5218,1.7089,2.9705,5.7082,1.8289,3.2576,2.7751,1.8261,0.2106,0.7514,10.8705,6.6182,6.2199,1.8593,0.9499,2.7656,3.4633,3.0171,1.7687,2.6141,1.2642,1.3098,0.1599,6.1094,1.7942,2.711,0.0248,1.6389,5.4485,0.966,1.9552,0.3481,4.189,1.565,0.5925,4.1756,0.5735,2.2455,7.7319,1.1601,1.2263,1.9214,3.2342,0.1569,4.7125,3.0977,3.0687,5.3005,1.0852,5.2487,3.109,1.5408,1.2932,1.386,3.6061,3.7002,3.9425,4.9631,2.4582,8.3662,3.2608,5.4474,5.762,1.0882,3.1753,0.8517,5.0091,0.0043,7.088,1.597,7.3107,4.8451,1.9231,0.25,4.7763,2.6236,1.203,0.0556,5.6363,3.7495,3.6746,1.1311,3.3023,4.6232,0.0003,2.6138,3.3937,0.8415,1.5879,0.7717,4.257,1.0909,8.8408,3.696,1.3885,4.6104,1.7396,2.4095,0.9285,3.2895,4.1247,0.9495,2.9618,4.4069,3.1868,7.8752,5.9814,0.6528,5.0837,2.7914,4.6949,5.0487,0.1755,1.4528,1.9362,0.0005,1.4064,0.5004,3.2873,1.0632,2.7945,5.4935,4.3174,1.31,0.3666,1.2971,3.765,0.3599,3.309,2.5246,3.8643,5.5797,0.7335,1.1667,0.9224,0.3305,3.4364,1.4861,5.0903,3.9213,2.8654,1.4196,3.6069,1.8415,2.8139,2.4102,6.365,0.7763,1.3456,1.9561,4.0051,1.4005,0.6076,1.1749,3.7005,6.1579,1.4515,1.3982,1.6376,3.2174,0.1717,3.7854,5.4393,0.1385,3.0783,5.7804,0.0412,8.0504,1.3719,2.5826,3.6264,1.1748,2.2305,0.3372,2.7354,1.4368,4.0481,4.3725,7.0112,0.5264,2.6975,1.0708,2.1348,1.2432,1.8082,1.8593,2.5363,1.3603,5.8383,3.8086,0.596,2.4968,2.6251,0.4573,2.9273,0.0939,1.64,1.6846,0.8058,3.9532,2.2832,3.0179,4.7609,3.8966,0.0005,1.8643,1.1143,0.3159,0.6412,3.1298,6.0387,2.37,0.0732,6.3898,6.3523,0.2955,1.8428,4.6024,3.5753,8.0975,2.0036,1.6875,0.6886,4.9241,0.3691,2.542,3.6367,0.914,0.4729,1.4114,2.7168,1.3935,2.6154,5.0014,0.895,1.0754,1.3387,2.0814,0.9334,1.0148,3.2928,3.367,1.3957,4.2952,1.4458,4.2311,0.9581,5.5109,3.896,4.8705,3.5476,1.0069]}

{"prompt":"At age 18 each person meets their soul-mate . For centuries everyone has fallen in love with theirs . You 're the first person to not love yours .","text":"At age 18 each person meets their soul-mate. For centuries everyone has fallen in love with theirs. You're the first person to not love yours. So at this magical moment, you are going to leave her alone forever.\nAt that moment, the only thing that matters is the feeling that you had for her. If you had a good feeling, all the rest matters. But even that is not enough to make her fall in love with you forever. For that, she needs evidence that you are the best option. And for that you need to show her that you are worthy of being chosen by her to live forever. For that we have to see what sort of personality you have.\nThe ideal personality for a woman would be romantic and tender. He would like to make her happy and he would put his life on hold to ensure that and when a girl finds the perfect man, she will not hesitate to leave him at home. But why do guys fall in love with so many girls and leave them like that?\nI believe it is because the girls of today are not so loyal. They are like the boys of the past, they just want to be in a relationship without being committed. When they find a partner who can be loyal, they would leave him alone. When they are in love with a girl who is loyal, they will always be with her, no matter what. I know many men who are attached to a girl because of the quality of love, without having to commit to her or being loyal. In this case, the men who fall in love today would never make her into their world.\nThe only thing that makes her fall in love is the evidence that you have shown her of being a good person. So if you want your lady to fall in love, you have to take that into account. You have to prove to her that your love is genuine.

{"prompt":"Write a story that can apply to a man that is dying and a baby being born","text":"Write a story that can apply to a man that is dying and a baby being born?\n\nI was working on a short story recently when I came across this dilemma. I know there are many similarities to the question, but I am looking for a specific answer.\nI have worked with a group of other writers a number of times and had a fairly successful session with one of them. While we were discussing the writing process, we had this conversation which I want to make clear that is not meant to be critical in any way and is meant to be just for my own edification as a writer.\n\nWhat do you think about if a man and a baby were being born and dying around the same time?\nThis got me thinking about whether my writing is trying to do something beyond just providing a story to be told.\nThis has always been a challenge for me. What are the qualities of a writer that help me do this and make a difference?\n\nA:\n\nThere are many things that make a story effective: the writing itself, the character development - even if the story is about people dying, you can use it to explore some core principles of life and ethics. You may also use the characters' relationship as a platform to explore deeper questions; for example, the man may be an atheist who has been dying, and the baby may be his eternal flame and wish to be born into the world.\nOr, as David says, you can use it to create empathy for the protagonist. As you write the person who is dying and is also being born, you come to know that person better, and you also need to understand the motivation of the protagonist within the story. I think this is important in fiction, but I agree with David that this particular problem is not a fiction problem, and your answer should be about how to answer a moral dilemma.\n\nA:\n\nI don't think this is really a novel\/romance\/memoir issue, per se. You should focus on the central dilemma of the story, rather than the details. For example:\n\nA man and a baby are dying.\nThe baby would like to be born, but his father is determined to kill him.\nHe must choose between the love of his child and his own life.\nWhich is more important to you (or the character) here: his father's love for his son or his desire to live?\n\nWith these options, you'll give them more nuance and have a better chance of succeeding with this particular story.","token_len":519,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0791,4.6634,7.0029,0.372,3.561,7.6661,5.3648,2.0036,7.3549,2.9977,4.7316,6.4429,3.8246,0.1731,4.2049,1.5487,0.006,2.9911,3.8354,4.6758,1.0606,0.8947,4.9028,0.393,6.0934,2.7513,0.6651,2.8365,0.1156,1.3528,9.7835,0.7428,1.2381,5.1318,3.4056,0.5165,1.6666,7.4802,2.5445,1.679,4.5355,2.1133,0.6303,1.2846,3.2779,4.5755,0.5571,1.538,3.7637,3.5246,1.0405,1.4234,15.7272,2.3984,4.5108,1.3443,2.174,4.847,0.175,6.0344,1.5162,5.9492,2.5057,0.0019,0.2516,1.912,4.0137,1.7296,5.3079,2.7145,6.2966,1.3751,2.8109,0.3863,0.5229,0.4676,4.915,2.8943,1.0242,2.2717,1.2046,5.2008,0.6729,0.6869,2.2754,2.5599,3.6815,1.4171,3.6427,2.2564,5.4155,0.0586,4.6155,0.4687,4.686,3.7944,0.7908,4.3837,0.3452,0.4852,7.3474,3.7401,1.31,0.0972,3.1731,1.907,2.3777,0.4747,0.5734,4.228,3.7293,4.3468,0.626,8.0979,0.3881,4.0664,0.9111,0.4202,0.3509,0.8667,0.0004,3.4068,2.5962,0.1777,1.0943,2.0079,6.9422,1.5873,1.9971,5.2608,0.2802,1.3034,3.2695,4.1453,0.3995,2.6654,6.2259,7.5033,0.3551,0.0569,0.0136,0.3788,0.4353,17.8761,8.843,0.3853,0.1511,0.7952,3.3393,4.6529,2.8629,2.0557,5.3885,0.0431,3.8391,1.1258,6.061,2.4378,5.019,1.2565,2.944,2.0596,4.2526,0.2453,1.2553,2.0112,17.2271,3.7867,2.5588,0.2667,1.218,3.5993,0.8781,0.1638,1.3515,4.2089,3.7784,0.9212,5.4994,1.3514,1.1937,0.8974,1.0318,5.8292,2.1162,4.0268,0.7807,3.5398,4.2837,2.5124,2.0115,1.0039,0.7712,0.0002,3.824,5.7454,3.4013,0.0001,4.0905,0.3914,1.5929,1.8797,0.6749,2.5239,0.6018,2.9172,5.0505,4.6352,2.8217,3.2397,3.0675,0.6174,0.3117,4.2248,1.8906,7.7053,4.812,2.5039,1.5561,1.2657,0.9472,2.9545,5.4444,3.0452,1.7589,3.4217,1.5635,3.7902,2.1742,0.4443,5.4056,4.0177,6.9841,6.2896,1.1839,3.5345,1.645,7.704,0.6297,3.8783,3.6356,2.6291,2.863,2.2609,4.7362,3.3517,4.991,3.4587,0.5525,4.7527,0.6467,1.8554,4.7519,3.3093,7.011,2.4124,0.2709,0.2048,3.0386,5.649,3.9439,1.4256,4.4507,3.7722,3.109,2.5198,2.2222,5.0268,2.984,2.3657,1.4065,0.7589,0.4796,0.3457,3.7297,8.2003,7.6097,3.3212,5.9469,1.8341,2.1893,3.1298,3.2809,1.756,0.5951,0.5514,0.4774,20.6223,1.464,3.6032,5.5868,5.3653,0.6674,2.49,0.6052,1.2214,1.9851,0.285,3.3821,6.2921,2.2934,1.4083,4.8368,1.31,4.5768,2.983,2.7751,2.0501,7.9968,3.2805,0.9748,0.4609,2.9532,3.2548,5.315,3.428,1.3842,1.7889,1.0759,6.7793,1.4026,3.1139,1.4954,6.2652,3.1129,2.3607,1.1881,1.815,3.8535,4.5273,0.2142,3.1774,2.1757,6.6073,1.8682,0.5507,2.6955,7.4033,0.8247,0.3123,0.5265,4.1893,1.887,1.5307,0.7962,3.0387,2.7067,5.44,1.277,1.9448,1.6191,6.7348,0.7901,2.1993,0.5711,2.4916,7.0265,4.5876,0.9833,2.0197,2.6182,5.8952,0.3959,1.5819,1.807,6.8638,5.8611,2.4652,0.9323,4.1587,2.4138,1.3084,5.201,4.0366,6.8685,1.5922,0.7282,0.2511,0.0002,2.0985,0.3234,0.0228,0.0002,1.8652,3.2209,0.0012,0.8413,2.2475,0.6182,3.7721,1.0102,4.2587,6.8441,5.7074,0.1817,3.4476,6.4618,0.0776,3.0907,1.3641,7.3361,0.005,0.6939,4.344,3.4513,3.5439,0.2248,1.0743,5.3268,5.5138,1.5597,1.2539,0.8757,1.3256,2.7946,0.0106,1.3008,5.6022,1.3492,4.3919,0.9972,3.3099,1.1542,0.0003,2.5958,1.8125,2.9235,0.3916,0.1546,0.5958,1.2895,1.7633,1.4669,16.6709,2.1623,6.4845,2.5338,0.1434,1.0666,0.2984,1.7247,0.7867,3.1195,2.4852,1.2604,6.3423,0.337,1.7446,0.8032,0.6609,0.6282,19.5716,4.4696,3.3041,0.5932,2.3703,5.0449,0.2572,0.5114,3.5593,0.3903,1.6348,1.7912,2.0681,0.5697,0.3555,22.1662,1.9274,2.4471,1.0458,1.5643,4.4418,5.3138,2.5512,2.482,3.3732,2.0805,6.8427,2.1121,3.4161,3.8506,2.154,1.819,1.2789,0.8302,1.5923,1.5354,0.4936,2.9469,0.2398,2.6762,4.3609,0.5595,0.0004,6.0724,3.3668,5.6751,0.7647,1.1613,4.776,6.4709,4.9611,3.2331,5.5133,1.0475,5.6052,1.145,1.8297,1.7889,0.5131,5.0508,4.4535,4.3369,3.0122,1.9024,0.3032]}
{"prompt":"A conjurer from the next universe over summons an eldritch demon from beyond the realm of knowledge , you . A normal person from THIS universe .","text":"A conjurer from the next universe over summons an eldritch demon from beyond the realm of knowledge, you. A normal person from THIS universe. She has no power of her own, she is a mere vessel. Her job is to summon a demon to a person who desires to be possessed, it is the most sinister thing ever. How do you kill a demon of that kind?\nTo say that the demon within the body of the person whom you have been having sex with is bad, I would have to say that she has lost her humanity. You can control what you can do but NOT your own physical body. Even if the demon killed the entire family that had been involved in incest, you would not loose your humanity and you would still have to pay the consequences of your actions. So that is more of a legal question rather than something I would agree with.\nAn elder demon is a demon that has had experience with the world and been on it for the long term. Its the old type demons that have been at this for decades. It is an extreme and evil sort of demon, a person like this in the next universe would have spent a lot of time in the world of the spiritual realm. Their souls are more powerful but the bodies are just human bodies covered with a soul. They are evil to a fault.\nIs that a witch I see. I have seen that many a time. I do not have the authority to grant a soul in this universe because as long as the soul has a body, it cannot be granted. You would have to use your spell to give a person a soul. You would have to use your power of psychic visions and be able to see within or outside this universe if the person you want the soul to be in is a person of low consciousness. There are many demons and people with strong souls that are in bad bodies. They are not evil, they are just in a body that has a soul. This is a very important thing to remember because even the most spiritual people are still human beings with a soul.\nI am very spiritual, I am the daughter of a powerful elder and I also have a soul that is more powerful than most. I do not have any control over my body because my body is the physical form of my soul. As of right now, I do not have the necessary power to heal a soul and so I can not help anyone within this universe.\nA demon has no power, it will be in a body until it no longer needs a body.

The relic is a relic from an ancient civilization, part of a mysterious artifact that the man is about to take back to his lab for further investigation, though not before he promises to keep the explorers safe for now. What part does the artefact play in the rest of the book?\nThe artifact is connected to the lab. The explorers realize, to understand it fully, that they need to know more about the man who has created it. Will the man tell the explorers and help them?\nThe artifacts are about the size of a large box, made entirely of the ancient, magical metal. It looks like no other type of metal. The metal is shredded into finely ground metal particles, and mixed and melted down into an alloy of metal with a strange, softness to it. When the alloy is solid, molded into shape, cut out to its necessary dimensions and shaped to the desired design, it has the appearance of a thin sheet of soft metal.\nHow does the man manipulate the metal with the hands? Using what?\nWhat is the man trying to tell us about the metal? How and why?\nWhat is happening in the caves that forces the man and his explorers to dig deeper so the machinery can reach as far as it can?\nExplain. What does the metal look like, and describe some of its properties.","token_len":521,"entropy":[6.4137,9.2206,2.2198,12.3012,4.3411,1.5539,8.5386,0.131,2.6556,10.427,6.9912,6.8812,5.4151,0.5541,3.5676,1.7055,5.7284,1.2276,2.6962,0.2293,0.6588,0.1486,1.3121,8.1865,2.562,9.8519,2.4733,3.5875,2.1331,8.391,2.8281,12.2527,3.5352,5.498,0.5758,2.1753,2.1066,5.1842,1.9018,8.6924,4.4645,8.7207,1.5941,0.0873,3.7817,1.5411,3.3231,2.9659,3.0233,6.1353,2.188,2.6809,4.6611,3.848,2.7536,5.9627,2.3614,2.5403,5.5103,0.5867,1.8862,1.7191,4.8294,1.6332,1.624,0.7553,2.7201,0.392,3.7352,5.7005,2.3669,1.4374,3.9841,5.0737,0.0054,1.1119,0.6505,8.9934,7.3377,7.6509,1.2196,3.5234,3.6482,4.6711,1.2668,2.7373,1.8236,0.3565,1.1203,2.0696,4.9921,0.9414,5.3619,1.8973,1.1293,3.2512,2.8516,8.7334,0.2922,5.5315,4.7886,6.738,2.4232,4.2765,2.0591,0.6896,1.463,0.8066,2.6978,5.195,1.7567,0.2937,1.5911,2.8828,3.2886,3.3171,2.8085,3.2247,3.8653,0.5952,8.5057,1.2446,3.6401,0.7826,3.5465,4.1248,4.5446,0.9608,3.842,4.3406,0.5446,3.4312,4.8007,5.8612,5.9369,4.0395,1.0862,0.6803,1.0332,0.5478,0.0071,5.4896,2.9617,2.326,0.7721,1.9433,3.2878,4.5961,4.4717,2.404,1.6717,5.2403,2.1275,5.003,3.2816,0.5598,1.3184,1.1777,0.4438,4.9982,5.5622,5.1171,1.2424,4.3431,2.72,8.3395,1.0823,3.7462,0.0011,5.1713,4.9579,3.9838,0.6559,2.7077,0.4928,1.2582,1.5198,4.2282,2.6654,5.5345,3.4449,5.5776,2.1773,0.9289,5.3249,2.1611,3.3392,1.8926,4.1729,2.493,7.3012,2.3871,0.8702,2.0387,6.9125,4.5285,0.3222,0.4743,2.3234,4.5025,1.9525,4.96,4.2235,4.8813,1.6428,3.0251,1.1068,1.2914,3.1776,4.9602,0.8324,0.5361,3.0092,1.5348,1.032,3.4859,5.7231,5.612,0.6852,1.3225,0.6698,3.5113,0.801,3.1036,2.0994,1.1554,2.286,2.5612,0.6692,1.0802,7.3975,1.2872,1.8581,2.9949,2.7886,5.5485,0.8788,3.2966,1.5054,2.5477,2.2832,1.5603,6.5479,1.0192,1.2538,1.4828,3.055,4.3237,0.6191,1.4596,5.2553,0.8844,3.7345,3.5499,2.2449,2.7667,1.2996,2.1509,1.1011,6.968,0.0632,1.0516,5.4263,3.9213,1.692,2.8748,1.4103,2.6973,4.9515,0.0069,5.0607,0.7013,1.0319,2.2121,4.3906,3.9199,1.9742,3.24,3.5388,4.8009,3.5412,3.0198,1.4483,6.9848,0.8496,2.9964,1.2621,5.4133,1.4872,3.4648,3.2198,0.1403,4.6995,5.9433,3.2146,0.4374,8.731,0.0102,1.5682,0.1502,0.4903,5.8543,0.0359,0.2277,5.228,0.2536,0.6505,1.1985,3.0298,1.096,5.7831,0.2109,0.9995,6.2539,2.5501,1.1641,7.198,6.2488,5.1474,5.1697,5.7789,2.627,5.5819,0.138,0.5084,2.0413,1.6352,0.3204,4.2402,1.7848,0.2033,0.7893,3.514,2.8412,2.7238,3.1617,0.7995,0.6017,6.2233,1.2805,1.0354,3.4941,1.7094,1.7641,5.0872,4.0224,0.2699,2.5437,0.8717,1.1021,3.4738,1.4376,6.0365,2.6584,5.1745,0.0635,0.7377,3.1655,4.4192,1.0673,4.7789,5.2099,0.1963,4.238,5.0133,5.4207,4.859,3.1884,1.5397,2.5599,3.931,0.5604,6.8155,1.1027,3.9898,0.0788,0.9953,1.8975,1.4036,4.0435,0.8933,10.4297,2.4283,7.26,4.205,5.1143,4.828,0.8969,1.3972,6.0923,4.8391,4.9125,4.7752,1.5266,3.8791,2.139,1.6295,3.0942,3.8264,1.5836,4.8733,2.0157,5.5762,3.8358,2.2645,0.1525,0.275,3.9672,0.9073,2.4473,0.6918,4.9114,0.7123,10.4525,0.6846,3.308,0.4792,8.6786,2.4937,3.8532,5.1988,5.9674,2.6799,2.0458,4.4497,2.593,2.3679,3.2211,5.3905,0.8021,1.4582,4.7428,1.6697,2.8375,0.0434,0.7762,6.868,2.6775,0.1735,5.972,1.3703,0.7984,1.2486,4.3356,1.4699,0.6258,0.862,5.9553,0.4376,1.1528,4.3658,1.5021,7.8051,0.9428,6.2658,5.1295,4.2541,0.8762,4.3669,1.1797,0.5261,0.4716,0.9543,0.0052,1.002,0.3569,0.2357,0.253,2.1208,1.3784,3.9795,6.0592,0.4579,1.4411,0.4263,2.6042,1.0085,7.0342,1.9601,0.2375,4.0095,4.2699,7.0211,0.3278,1.8086,4.2795,1.5315,2.8464,0.1841,3.4137,1.8203,6.6306,2.5844,6.4117,0.6939,3.6652,7.4087,1.1128,0.2392,2.518,0.7048,0.9344,0.471,2.4635,0.1025,0.2851,1.2963,2.5909,0.2338,6.1079,2.451,0.0041,2.3691,0.9778,10.108,5.434,0.283,1.7301,1.4631,3.0558]}

Studies confirm we didn't go deaf, it was sound itself that ceased to exist. From a first-person perspective, describe what happens next, and what the world and society is like 10 years later. What a huge change that has been!\nWhat do you think these narratives have in common? 10 years are a very big time span for change, so one of the first narrative characteristics would be the loss which has taken place, in a sense. If we consider what happened to the animals in the story, we understand that we have lost an aspect of the world that we have taken for granted for a long time. It was an essential part of life, but we took it for granted. It seems that change has brought about a sort of loss in how we relate to the world around us.\nIn terms of our relationship with the natural world, what does it mean now to say that we do not think of it as a thing we have created but that it is, on the contrary, something that exists on its own, from the beginning and forever? In short, we lose part of our identity. But if you look at what happened to both the animals and the humans, you realize that there was no change in the human and animal species, only change within each of these. If you consider the 10-year period described in the article, we see that the narratives show a transition or progress and development in both the human and animal aspects. But in my opinion, it would be wrong to say such a thing. Nature has a way of progressing and evolving in its own way. The changes that have occurred in the species are not our results, not to say our creation. But something has definitely changed.\nIn terms of social change, we can only talk about the changes that we have actually experienced. Our society has become much more technological, and more materialistic. We have lost aspects of who we were. But, if we look at what happened to the animals, and especially to the animals we have considered sacred and to whom we have given sacred value, we cannot deny that this change has brought a sense of loss and a sense of a lack of purpose. As a society, we have lost this sense of purpose. But this loss is not related to nature. I think a major theme of society today is social isolation. When we were children our sense of community was much more important. But now as adults we have started to focus on individualism. As a result, now our sense of purpose is focused on this sense of individualism.","token_len":522,"entropy":[9.3203,5.612,8.406,4.6413,1.3874,11.4387,5.3906,6.9516,7.431,0.0003,5.1332,5.3325,1.9203,4.1956,1.0825,6.6491,6.6344,1.9447,6.5641,1.9179,1.6442,0.5568,6.3957,2.8664,6.0236,1.9943,0.5387,0.303,0.394,13.0942,2.4016,3.6258,2.3209,2.4518,1.9335,3.2986,3.4264,3.9299,5.207,4.9891,3.7405,1.2959,8.0804,1.5056,0.8568,0.3274,4.2861,4.7277,5.3611,2.4789,3.1003,2.4568,0.7533,3.3909,1.0756,8.3187,2.8099,0.2936,0.5379,6.6976,8.5153,2.9904,1.063,0.0107,0.3011,8.6451,0.4593,6.1817,1.6571,2.8604,4.6984,1.2584,5.5913,1.3496,6.3315,1.5725,3.4756,5.85,1.9078,0.3976,3.5197,8.8038,8.6688,5.5348,0.307,1.6895,4.8404,10.2762,2.4817,3.029,0.1759,3.3792,3.8654,2.722,2.3877,2.0921,4.2108,1.7153,4.7743,2.892,1.3278,2.2099,1.3624,6.6842,2.0721,0.8484,5.1021,0.593,2.2382,5.6498,0.8548,2.9622,2.7016,1.5378,3.8642,3.793,0.1234,1.4572,2.6393,2.4051,1.7983,3.1327,5.3731,0.4132,0.0038,3.0117,2.3963,0.8623,0.1413,0.5,3.1262,2.4268,3.5518,5.7681,1.032,0.0139,2.9799,1.5917,2.1432,2.2889,5.1996,0.5429,0.2486,0.0042,1.3537,2.5615,4.571,1.529,6.0409,1.6873,6.0297,1.4498,1.6468,5.5845,0.001,4.6196,2.6089,4.5133,0.4719,4.2954,0.072,1.6403,0.4886,2.1509,0.0091,0.5039,1.8078,3.5287,3.5531,0.001,3.3788,3.3717,0.5037,0.8084,5.5402,0.0334,0.2177,2.2077,2.7845,1.528,0.6116,5.4848,1.7657,4.026,0.6143,1.1002,5.0816,0.7484,5.198,1.6689,3.0227,0.319,1.5713,4.0928,1.9522,2.0685,3.7594,4.414,3.5999,1.9222,0.959,4.3098,5.1154,1.3978,1.7089,0.0445,1.3801,1.2646,3.2126,4.372,3.2856,0.0057,1.9525,5.9352,1.4041,2.8005,3.6943,6.1064,1.6228,3.3732,3.9584,0.1091,2.2448,6.8932,5.4579,0.0154,1.7646,3.4622,1.5441,4.9149,3.3113,2.3328,1.584,0.214,2.0832,1.4842,0.6891,7.2218,1.3107,1.0419,0.5195,0.8678,1.8846,0.7939,3.2404,3.6679,0.402,2.5941,1.8666,2.7224,2.856,1.517,1.3169,4.3526,4.2771,0.821,4.5778,1.7827,3.0556,3.0764,4.1497,4.897,1.7446,3.2609,2.5879,3.9011,0.9759,3.7532,1.3693,8.1466,1.6518,0.09,2.0205,6.9033,1.3626,0.5253,5.7759,0.5455,2.4305,3.9008,0.8086,1.6037,10.1921,6.7481,2.4957,5.6428,6.5932,6.7007,4.4801,7.6937,2.4295,2.5989,1.6689,1.412,0.1245,0.5861,5.3039,1.4156,4.0761,3.1255,5.1077,1.4527,0.2682,2.741,3.2829,0.4426,2.3661,0.1467,1.3693,7.0345,0.3582,2.2073,1.5772,7.3574,1.9893,3.3113,3.4155,0.1344,7.447,1.6213,3.0013,2.4478,2.9193,1.2468,0.5001,0.9464,2.7245,3.7567,1.6209,1.5672,1.2387,1.464,1.0056,5.2733,1.9871,1.7709,5.931,5.5675,1.1427,4.7929,5.7519,1.6392,3.6055,6.1268,1.8443,3.2292,6.0614,1.5042,6.8222,0.8025,1.5397,1.1504,2.8589,1.6313,0.001,5.4294,2.1571,0.2734,3.3366,2.8523,3.7571,3.7809,0.1767,1.4932,2.3236,0.8191,2.6019,0.8635,5.9108,1.051,0.9977,4.6057,2.7427,0.9717,2.8078,2.838,0.1927,8.8898,1.2244,1.4046,3.115,6.8187,0.0379,0.9441,1.6907,1.0218,3.2173,6.0988,0.0429,5.7412,0.0562,0.7697,2.286,3.4731,4.4034,2.984,0.711,1.6179,0.1314,1.8297,0.9122,0.4682,0.6934,0.9638,0.8603,3.4116,5.9924,1.2101,0.3936,1.9617,3.5238,1.9901,5.5828,6.5519,2.052,3.925,4.6785,0.301,0.7806,2.309,5.3189,6.7095,0.2506,1.304,4.5607,2.1567,0.6629,2.9682,2.4205,0.8776,2.7407,4.3265,4.6225,0.0172,1.7085,2.0653,1.8352,0.3872,0.0204,4.8874,4.0522,0.1083,4.5939,0.8638,4.786,1.9098,1.7295,0.3903,0.5657,1.422,1.0364,3.9339,0.944,0.1358,2.0692,1.2195,3.761,3.4231,1.185,1.3322,1.3086,5.5526,0.0903,5.4747,1.3589,4.8223,1.3861,4.7585,4.7041,4.0616,0.9651,6.1397,2.1386,0.1822,5.239,5.8855,0.5302,4.0343,1.0363,3.9637,3.044,5.161,4.3762,0.0103,3.6258,0.8276,4.3625,1.3245,2.1537,2.0582,2.7075,1.6094,4.6506,1.8757,0.9769,1.6162,5.2563,0.1862,4.8985,0.5861,4.6249,3.3906,1.4444,4.5536,1.0734,3.1791,0.6826,6.3367,3.1866,1.0607,0.0032,3.9593,0.8373,6.3053,0.5171,6.0508,3.7055,0.0776,3.5661,0.5054,0.7075]}

{"prompt":"In a society where medicine has solved the problem of aging , people routinely live for centuries . In a world where everyone appears roughly the same age , how does `` real '' age affect relationships ?","text":"In a society where medicine has solved the problem of aging, people routinely live for centuries. In a world where everyone appears roughly the same age, how does `` real '' age affect relationships? And why is the way people age so important?\nA recent study shows the problem in more depth. In the article, researchers found that people tend to date someone 1 or 2 years younger if their age gap is small and 3 years younger if they're older. But that pattern of age gaps did not seem to apply to people of similar age : Younger people of the same age tended to date older people about 4 years younger. Researchers found the same relationship on many other aspects of people's social lives.\nOne reason for this may be that people try to create a sense of order in their lives. The study of personality traits shows that people often want to match the characteristics of others in their lives (think of the traits like introversion, extroversion, conscientiousness, imagination, etc. ). If you want your significant other to have your same mindset and outlook on life, you may date someone slightly younger (or an equally old person who doesn't mind dating a younger person ).\nA separate study shows that even when people know this pattern of age differences in dating, they often don't realize how similar their own age is to the other people they're dating. In research, researchers told college students that they thought their peers were in the age range of 18 to 22 years old.\nThen the researchers asked the students to report how many years younger or older they thought they were. The results were surprising in a few ways. One pattern revealed is that people are more likely to date older people when they themselves are younger than the others. The most surprising trend showed that not many people realized their own age.\nSo even when there are similar patterns in dating, people often end up dating someone who they think is younger and their own age is often not what they report in the initial questionnaire.\nOne reason for this may be that, whether it's dating or anything else, people need to maintain a sense of coherence and control in their world. For example, when you know someone is a doctor at age 40 and has a two year old child, you may want to form a romantic relationship so that you can get a sense of social status, or you know he's an adult and you can have more sex. But when the other person knows you are very young, you don't want to date someone you think is too old. Because it feels like an infringement upon those social norms and expectations.","token_len":522,"entropy":[3.4603,6.9687,1.0939,8.8915,2.8065,9.2788,1.689,1.5355,0.3036,5.4682,0.5363,5.0547,7.91,5.3264,3.8922,4.9257,1.5817,3.0835,2.5686,2.6195,0.3201,4.4936,8.0398,8.6078,1.2906,0.0177,0.3015,0.3295,4.8211,2.9943,14.5466,13.4078,4.1861,1.8288,3.4828,6.7852,0.7665,3.5919,2.9506,1.9013,2.5614,5.1778,2.4903,2.8278,0.945,1.9784,0.7169,1.637,9.99,3.1318,1.0884,4.0737,3.82,6.2223,4.5986,3.5612,4.5873,0.9129,2.1904,1.9298,6.4859,0.9083,3.7443,3.1493,0.1869,2.0511,4.147,0.0319,5.9115,5.7006,10.1743,3.3589,0.3392,0.2291,1.0933,5.457,3.0941,3.6276,7.0152,0.5492,3.1791,2.6806,8.5678,1.3374,0.431,0.0588,1.4555,2.2411,0.8042,0.7508,3.4924,3.0989,7.4036,2.6628,2.151,4.6897,5.1309,0.0333,4.0618,0.0771,3.8125,0.2171,2.3483,2.5295,4.222,0.9934,10.5082,7.5863,0.27,4.6854,1.5649,0.0886,0.2957,2.9027,0.027,0.4566,2.0509,0.2628,4.6117,4.8778,0.6612,0.6453,1.4038,5.1112,2.0379,3.6636,1.0693,4.1068,5.1783,5.3192,0.9338,5.1322,0.1155,4.2036,0.1444,5.3593,1.3505,0.8597,1.2879,3.6292,3.3472,1.7555,1.0861,2.4689,0.1483,0.5771,1.9444,7.1932,0.1722,6.3507,1.5091,2.4479,0.0161,5.7444,1.5526,0.6759,0.2902,1.0191,3.0239,4.295,4.012,6.931,3.7949,2.9065,0.2855,0.938,2.875,3.9261,0.409,7.2992,2.8704,3.8382,0.255,1.735,2.8708,2.0725,0.8023,4.967,4.7972,1.4831,2.0207,6.4065,4.9911,6.6409,0.3242,0.6293,4.7599,0.0019,0.016,0.1857,3.108,0.0206,0.349,7.6278,0.3153,1.7909,4.7253,1.5003,4.0608,1.506,2.0284,4.2209,8.3745,0.0787,0.1236,2.5963,4.2764,4.7935,8.3471,1.9419,4.3218,2.1215,0.0922,0.4919,0.792,2.8628,8.9254,1.041,6.0746,0.8279,3.5859,2.2285,5.2954,5.2849,3.6287,0.298,3.3549,3.0469,0.0004,4.4928,1.3872,2.6681,1.3455,0.1975,5.6776,1.4985,3.567,5.8982,0.6971,3.7759,0.3105,5.5189,2.0191,0.96,5.3859,6.1918,3.5455,1.3051,0.9146,2.9303,2.0417,2.302,2.034,0.6658,2.7501,2.9501,0.0008,3.529,2.3498,5.5525,2.5584,3.8179,1.9793,1.2045,0.9922,1.9388,2.3907,0.5023,1.486,2.5875,0.1003,0.2791,2.2431,6.6205,2.6487,1.6345,5.8027,7.1484,0.1646,1.0551,1.2357,4.8473,2.2572,4.3841,1.0701,5.0655,1.3483,5.3625,0.5395,0.4915,4.6132,0.6454,4.0018,1.6519,0.5179,1.1857,3.0876,6.1443,3.0344,1.1091,1.2286,2.2323,1.0401,0.6943,5.5556,1.9349,1.9099,2.0589,4.9344,3.6234,0.7222,0.2467,2.4051,0.8725,0.2842,1.7215,1.8379,2.6168,1.6186,1.9603,5.5706,2.0766,4.0325,0.4342,0.4192,2.0018,8.6258,5.349,5.5164,0.2732,1.5301,2.8592,1.2736,0.5152,0.144,0.5839,1.2365,0.2971,3.1252,0.4608,6.9126,0.4858,1.1867,1.186,2.5045,3.0928,0.4764,2.5559,4.6192,4.1596,5.4136,5.7077,1.149,6.3322,4.6509,0.5208,4.4663,2.5841,1.8895,0.2142,2.8558,1.0262,3.8791,4.7096,1.3673,4.2786,1.3981,3.5191,1.5915,1.3442,0.8471,0.5324,2.5361,2.0198,4.3129,0.0165,0.5109,2.5053,1.879,3.7183,2.3235,0.3503,2.1473,3.7007,5.3336,2.4311,0.2527,1.1282,5.2434,3.7722,3.7479,0.4145,9.5452,3.7506,1.9435,5.323,3.6209,0.2446,1.3375,3.3442,3.2176,1.4661,0.3543,0.6644,0.0349,0.2214,4.8687,6.6998,2.2069,0.3761,4.7139,3.0039,6.4419,0.1458,0.1486,1.1422,5.1631,0.3263,4.9984,1.1385,0.6303,0.0086,7.5416,1.0189,1.7368,3.5645,1.8184,0.4078,7.1536,0.5716,3.863,0.8198,0.0405,2.5227,2.0895,3.9502,1.7507,0.9404,3.2945,6.6937,5.884,3.6074,3.8629,2.1879,9.0405,1.3426,6.4012,1.9291,1.9102,2.3352,0.455,0.6927,1.5802,2.8202,0.125,8.2063,0.6441,3.7974,0.3611,6.0362,0.6856,1.2898,0.6872,3.0136,1.9079,3.809,0.0357,7.2254,1.9878,2.728,3.1742,1.8484,6.6419,4.8594,0.8226,3.4933,3.119,1.3148,1.6841,2.0033,3.4737,4.7498,3.3356,1.2299,2.1408,2.1615,3.3671,3.0824,0.1027,4.1284,0.9789,1.748,5.9718,1.0052,0.8155,0.6835,3.0376,0.0013,0.6224,0.2334,2.5195,2.5756,3.0975,1.7818,0.3632,3.0685,1.1023,1.0245,5.5869,2.8603,5.5591,0.7601,3.648,8.4539,4.2101,5.7939,3.435,1.7413,2.2767,3.3485,0.7388]}
{"prompt":"Everyone on earth is gone , except your high school graduating class , and you graduated more than 15 years ago . The lights are still on , the internet still works , it has only been a few days ...","text":"Everyone on earth is gone, except your high school graduating class, and you graduated more than 15 years ago. The lights are still on, the internet still works, it has only been a few days... and it is like Christmas morning or Thanksgiving day.. the light at the end of this tunnel is right here with you..... its real and it's bright.\nThe best of luck to you and your family. There is no more time like the present. Enjoy every day, be grateful, live in the moment and don't let the past control you.\nHappy new year to your family! It is always a nice treat to see a piece of my own high school graduation year...but thankfully it doesn't look like mine!\nAnd for those of you who are graduating: Take time now to plan what you want to do with your career or education after high school. You don't have to pick a major right now, but pick what you are interested in to get started on college applications. There are no guarantees. But if you really want to get into the field or university you want you have to apply soon.\nThank you for posting that. When I go down that road again, I intend to take this picture and hang it up...alongside my high school diploma.\nI have read that a lot of people who have graduated so long ago, who can't think of much about their graduation day except for memories, don't remember much about the ceremony itself. I can understand that...so please, take time to think about your day, take pictures...don't think about the past, even though I know you can't avoid it completely! Think about what you want to do in some way in the future.\nThere are so many graduation dates coming up before that time. May I suggest using the internet to help you plan your next steps? If you plan how to get into college as soon as possible at your high school, you can do as soon as that is scheduled, and then you can apply later. If you plan how to get into a specific college or university from your high school, then you can apply as early as possible.\nThe internet is the perfect place for doing this.

{"prompt":"There 's a new smart drug on the streets , but the police can not outsmart criminals unless they take the drug themselves .","text":"There's a new smart drug on the streets, but the police can not outsmart criminals unless they take the drug themselves. The smart drugs are also called synthetic cannabinoids and they can only be found in black markets. One of the smart drugs is called Moxie X and it was released in 2017. The drug is very similar to the cannabis plant. The Moxie X is a drug that can be used for recreational purposes but the dose that you consume depends on the drug. To be used for recreational purposes, the dose of Moxie X should stay below 40 milligrams. If you want some relaxation and you feel a little sleepy, you could take up to 20 milligrams. But if you want some high and a powerful effect, then it will be up to 60 milligrams. People who are using the drug Moxie X often do it to help overcome anxiety and depression. Using Moxie X on an empty stomach can worsen the nervous system and it can lead to a crash which can have a harmful effect on your mood. However, most users have very low tolerance and if they go beyond the recommended dosage, their mood instantly improves and they feel more energized. But this can lead to uncontrollable emotions and intense cravings. This can be an addictive problem, but it is not something that can just happen overnight, it can take years for a user to develop tolerance. Although, many experts believe that it can create a severe addiction that can lead to more intense cravings and severe mood swings. But, if you are a regular user of Moxie X or you are looking to try it, you should go slowly. Moxie X will not cause you any bad effects if you do not use it too often but you should avoid it during any surgery or medication you take. If you have not done your research then you might be using an unverified dose of Moxie X and that can be harmful to your health. Users of Moxie X say it works better when people are together and in groups, they say that it makes them feel a little high and it can bring them closer. But it can also be a dangerous drug if you do not try this drug with care. If you have an addiction to Moxie X, you should seek attention from a professional in addiction counselling. This drug can create addictive behaviour and it can lead to severe mood swings that can take you out of your body and can lead to you losing focus and being unable to cope. So, it is a bad idea to try this drug during a rough times.","token_len":523,"entropy":[3.3687,1.5364,4.3442,8.7395,6.7464,3.7046,0.0993,6.9885,1.8896,2.1767,3.0463,6.4711,3.6571,6.5294,8.3116,0.5007,5.5971,6.0932,0.3619,4.2778,2.2632,2.868,4.0958,1.2214,2.7066,4.6746,1.8953,1.3092,4.834,4.7196,6.456,2.7354,2.4856,1.8879,2.2834,5.0372,0.257,3.5801,0.3668,5.4985,1.7895,0.9234,5.5299,1.0271,0.3214,4.252,0.1637,0.8989,2.6646,5.4677,4.0877,0.9103,4.9674,3.9647,0.5306,3.9764,4.406,1.3276,6.347,0.7877,2.2097,2.0422,0.9609,3.9651,2.7718,0.0878,2.3794,4.6809,3.7807,2.5579,2.1723,4.1023,0.0059,0.0136,0.2835,0.8671,1.4714,3.8679,0.7607,2.2435,0.7852,1.2643,1.9793,3.8719,0.4508,2.7728,2.8403,7.4346,4.3318,2.3879,4.9198,2.8222,0.1067,0.9328,3.087,1.2175,5.8905,2.732,4.5264,1.1103,0.9727,0.1317,0.7416,2.1826,2.3422,2.0358,1.4969,0.0034,0.0031,0.0297,2.9075,7.4645,3.1073,3.9006,2.3937,0.0476,0.01,1.094,3.1755,0.2751,2.8564,6.4053,6.3251,2.2238,4.4487,3.477,3.2428,1.1334,3.2349,0.5009,1.1803,3.015,1.9116,4.4619,0.3339,2.6793,0.8467,0.0036,0.0071,1.6316,4.0066,1.568,0.1302,1.4831,2.8907,4.6352,1.883,5.0693,6.7597,3.0569,0.3212,2.7133,3.1748,2.6278,0.8504,5.5919,0.0061,9.4723,0.2699,0.0036,0.0041,0.3489,5.749,1.4471,1.7117,2.5125,1.6419,1.321,11.2664,0.0062,0.0055,0.0707,3.3521,3.5794,3.3464,2.5547,3.4742,6.7178,2.4949,1.4227,1.1713,0.368,7.2306,1.582,0.0011,0.0037,0.0189,4.1412,3.5147,2.8343,0.0252,1.7948,7.0682,1.8231,6.3048,0.068,1.468,3.0684,0.5874,2.4303,0.0138,2.3356,6.9993,4.3592,0.8352,3.8117,1.5539,5.3267,0.2193,0.5365,1.3309,4.2121,0.4826,4.9197,0.1145,5.0816,3.7837,3.6887,3.8219,1.9392,1.6787,2.0239,3.578,1.0242,4.3786,6.3387,1.9108,2.9934,1.7405,0.8448,3.6534,2.1497,8.8945,2.0741,1.9844,0.4517,2.5138,2.3404,4.767,0.0914,0.429,4.7882,3.8462,2.1248,2.0501,0.0302,6.3,0.0142,4.459,1.2227,6.3958,6.6097,0.0001,0.5389,3.3806,1.2264,2.202,4.1428,3.6021,3.4386,3.1436,2.2768,1.538,1.1102,1.4836,3.1657,0.7343,1.6363,5.246,3.0691,2.8801,3.3762,1.6044,0.8621,1.5945,2.4996,2.7233,2.2859,3.9677,0.0645,3.007,1.8012,0.5692,5.8917,3.625,3.6728,4.9062,1.2591,0.2183,2.6629,2.0881,8.1588,0.7971,5.041,2.7778,2.9839,0.7367,1.076,0.0256,5.5878,5.4955,2.32,0.0,1.3564,5.3062,3.0785,0.1726,0.2789,3.9758,1.7168,2.5426,0.4086,1.4696,2.6865,2.8838,0.1611,0.997,1.3053,0.0015,0.0017,0.0485,4.615,2.0576,1.192,3.2767,1.2215,3.6411,1.2104,1.0582,1.457,1.3087,4.5689,6.3403,0.9086,4.3726,0.013,0.0064,0.0438,3.203,1.6179,2.5135,1.1267,1.4464,5.13,1.7977,3.849,0.3005,2.5824,0.3268,2.2158,0.3221,5.3513,1.1059,5.8139,1.9174,1.0094,3.5594,2.1596,5.6962,4.3723,9.5766,1.3007,4.0401,2.9424,0.9763,0.4045,2.5118,0.1214,2.1347,4.5559,4.1417,3.2803,1.4777,3.9657,0.7474,3.5614,1.7834,4.5509,3.5869,3.6024,6.2659,5.7968,0.8621,0.2382,0.0024,0.002,0.0219,2.602,3.9007,3.1554,1.9459,2.2317,1.1918,0.6126,0.3874,0.2816,7.1142,2.3766,0.7809,0.001,0.0015,0.0072,6.038,2.7778,4.8336,1.8081,2.8368,5.2936,1.2748,6.7727,1.211,4.2541,3.5676,2.2429,4.0617,3.6381,1.4083,0.7903,2.971,0.7048,0.7547,4.9489,1.0409,9.3174,1.2542,3.0384,1.4513,4.8647,2.5905,3.3808,3.7731,2.2259,2.8003,1.4025,0.7209,2.6411,2.6269,3.012,1.1127,2.5435,0.9445,2.1262,0.0777,5.0035,5.7568,1.8175,3.1047,6.456,0.3552,2.5772,0.1202,1.9324,3.336,1.9044,0.9145,1.0779,0.0009,0.0014,0.0061,0.9937,1.3924,0.794,3.4996,7.0204,0.6237,1.1949,3.2855,4.5886,7.9153,3.0979,1.1156,3.9632,6.2377,0.9618,5.7021,5.7689,2.9582,1.2061,1.5265,0.4397,1.72,0.0462,3.466,1.7231,0.0355,3.543,0.344,5.018,3.3777,3.1437,0.0236,1.1421,5.0619,1.3041,2.6923,1.3928,0.0486,3.5199,2.9218,5.6579,1.343,3.7899,1.9707,0.0017,5.0612,1.309,3.9418,0.6695,2.6589,0.4254,3.5227,4.3524,0.6423,0.1311,1.5992,1.5263,0.2369,4.2415,2.3834,6.8225,5.8961,1.606]}
{"prompt":"The prank video to end all prank videos","text":"The prank video to end all prank videos is, well, not funny. When it comes to prank videos, there\u2019s one that always seems a little too easy. The \u201cpranking\u201d of celebrities. As it turns out, the internet has always been full of pranks as long as there have been video cameras and social media. Sometimes it\u2019s a good thing. Sometimes, [\u2026]\nWhen it comes to celebrity pranks, there\u2019s always an element of luck involved, but one prank is just plain ridiculous. The last time anyone went so far as to prank Justin Bieber into taking a selfie with a plastic knife was this past summer. This time though, it\u2019s much more extreme. Instead of a selfie, [\u2026]\nIt\u2019s a given that some of the biggest stars in Hollywood have been known for some of the greatest pranks in recent history. However, this girl\u2019s prank of Kim Kardashian was just too much. So much so, it\u2019s hard to even count. But it\u2019s an impressive achievement, nonetheless. The first person to have a [\u2026]\nPranks are a tradition in Hollywood. Whether you like them or you dislike them, they are always happening. But in the video above, it\u2019s a little unusual, because it\u2019s a fake prank. However, it definitely brings to mind plenty of other fake pranks that are always posted that may or may not actually be fake, [\u2026]\nThe pranks can get rather extreme, sometimes. So to this week\u2019s point, it is a rare celebrity that doesn\u2019t have a funny video to share. For example, this week, a celebrity had to post his reaction to the fake wedding of Prince Harry and Megan Markle. You can see it here. If that didn\u2019t [\u2026]\nWhether you agree or not, celebrities seem to always get pranked. Whether it\u2019s a good joke or if it\u2019s a little mean, they\u2019ll get pranked. One prank this week, was from a video in which a woman gets pranked into trying to kill her boyfriend by shooting him in the head with a gun. [\u2026]\nOver the years, pranks have been around.

It can also be used for storing essential oils, a spoon, scissors or other items that you may need out of the bath.\nMade from stainless steel \u2013 Stainless steel is a very special stainless steel that we have chosen for its strength, hardness and durability. Steel with this particular alloy, 18\/10 (18% chromium, 10% nickel, and about 10% other trace elements, including carbon, fluoride, bismuth), can be used in many applications, such as kitchen appliances\nIf you have seen your bathroom cabinetry and flooring, you know that it can be dull. It is possible to bring a bit of color to it with lighting fixtures. If you add colored light to an ordinary ceiling, it can look great, and as we said before, even better with a touch of blue.\nI love the color blue, but I never realized how it could be used. If you like the blue color, you should find a good alternative to brighten up your bathroom.\nI\u2019m going to use light as an example. I have a blue ceiling in my living room, and in order to bring some color, I decided to buy some white color bulbs. I am not only buying them in the store, but online as well.\nI am looking for all different shapes with different colors. White light is very hard for me to find. For that reason, I looked into the websites with the best deals and found them.\nWhen shopping online, you have to find a way to look at the color of the lamp. To do that, on the website you will find a color wheel. The color wheel will look like this.","token_len":525,"entropy":[5.5243,1.4208,6.9713,1.4769,2.4639,2.6017,3.4742,4.6236,10.4539,8.4906,1.2169,0.8617,5.3154,3.5435,3.3057,2.6525,3.4147,11.2012,3.4587,5.3696,1.4313,3.0227,9.7687,2.4735,4.2125,4.7779,3.2335,5.9114,6.5862,1.804,2.28,12.9128,8.275,4.3315,2.6017,0.4549,3.5249,0.7975,3.3954,2.0176,0.4934,2.0442,7.7175,6.034,1.24,5.8684,3.6952,1.2631,1.9296,2.5155,5.8161,1.8333,4.2022,3.6675,3.2095,6.379,0.3089,2.0543,1.5397,2.9865,3.3784,2.8037,1.2729,0.7048,2.9353,3.6649,2.0829,2.3097,1.4876,3.1575,4.3971,2.9637,2.7865,1.3404,0.866,1.6939,4.1456,5.0142,2.737,1.0381,2.2673,5.6241,0.9132,2.5918,1.6953,5.2319,6.3858,3.5595,2.9044,1.2603,0.851,0.5821,0.9532,0.562,5.2295,5.0703,1.4306,4.9288,2.5123,3.5053,1.9085,3.2301,4.5269,3.4422,3.9752,1.3907,1.4175,3.5161,2.8625,0.5267,0.8604,0.7427,6.1354,4.6918,1.1766,3.0637,1.8036,5.101,1.8073,1.8073,5.3147,2.1283,0.1998,1.1348,5.6416,5.2779,1.2849,6.9155,0.7013,1.6323,5.099,0.1403,4.2601,3.9765,8.0049,1.2244,2.2195,6.2111,1.1701,2.0029,5.736,5.5392,3.787,0.3927,1.9324,2.0879,7.5926,2.3824,2.5183,3.3433,2.7091,3.7373,5.6866,0.1297,5.0472,1.6637,3.3404,6.7769,4.7186,3.6234,4.1588,0.4363,1.758,7.7218,0.0297,6.8415,2.7191,3.8934,5.0746,1.2356,5.4229,0.3181,2.8049,6.4563,3.4187,5.5793,1.4999,1.5391,1.0585,5.108,4.6,1.9164,5.8335,5.356,0.1526,8.7984,0.8854,1.7874,2.7845,1.5136,0.1295,0.351,1.4879,4.9502,6.9072,1.7464,1.5774,5.6769,7.3993,0.9702,5.6138,1.3241,2.6586,3.4015,1.9976,1.6594,2.3051,0.5783,7.4062,0.1883,0.8461,2.9403,0.6116,1.1848,5.7143,1.7915,3.1957,0.0205,9.0173,6.1875,1.5086,1.2839,1.8123,2.9531,5.0687,5.5188,0.035,2.0981,4.1738,2.4381,3.7568,1.5584,1.8305,3.3047,1.4401,3.7955,0.5329,1.2569,0.1656,6.026,6.3848,4.4613,5.1608,3.2819,3.9658,10.3646,5.786,3.8217,4.4226,4.1911,2.9329,5.7324,0.0239,2.1401,2.8623,0.2451,2.9653,0.9737,3.7298,5.4667,2.6713,0.1618,5.3682,6.5577,1.0428,3.0754,3.8339,4.2752,1.3895,5.9049,0.4254,5.2016,2.142,0.002,5.2096,3.4329,1.039,1.1009,1.7798,1.8899,2.7896,1.6958,2.0864,0.0044,5.9207,2.9907,7.9696,5.4166,0.2516,2.2592,6.2956,3.8913,5.0554,13.1599,2.1925,4.0796,6.1431,1.3,2.6368,0.8338,1.0886,0.4525,1.6135,2.8282,0.6884,8.1361,2.4155,2.4346,1.274,3.9695,0.3431,6.162,2.6427,5.4787,0.107,3.6373,0.9974,2.6043,2.018,8.1656,3.9411,1.5658,3.3088,0.4568,5.1566,5.6292,3.1158,1.3071,4.2417,3.7819,4.608,1.806,1.2326,1.1072,3.5807,4.9092,2.7036,2.7877,5.9599,4.0592,2.9576,1.6543,0.2885,4.6435,3.5763,2.7788,1.3307,5.5719,0.0329,4.1565,1.599,1.4651,5.0945,3.5797,1.8944,3.0346,4.4323,1.8241,2.2617,1.495,4.6627,4.554,0.9327,3.3411,2.135,0.9766,1.9238,2.137,3.9391,0.4367,4.108,2.1797,3.1632,2.2946,0.536,1.1405,2.8942,5.2045,0.8989,3.5676,5.101,2.1626,5.0635,5.217,1.8415,0.4134,1.0088,1.3066,1.4192,2.5838,16.8781,6.8203,2.7968,3.973,0.0674,3.2673,6.0632,3.4196,2.42,3.9121,1.2154,1.2659,2.2123,1.5456,4.881,3.8655,3.2543,0.2824,2.1609,0.0178,1.3404,0.8009,4.6137,3.3335,0.0639,4.2553,3.2033,1.1499,2.7284,0.161,4.4635,0.1864,4.6934,2.1626,4.4033,6.4147,4.8457,0.9997,1.1077,3.2533,2.444,4.7104,4.5255,2.7911,3.5142,1.8337,3.3154,0.3515,0.2982,6.7277,1.685,0.0179,0.3681,2.166,1.3548,2.4163,3.9443,0.5738,5.9371,4.7452,5.1319,5.4369,1.0484,1.0521,1.1469,5.8256,4.2709,1.2749,2.8248,4.673,3.7113,0.6975,1.0873,1.5005,1.428,4.9884,3.5057,0.2351,0.4525,0.121,6.1681,2.002,2.7452,7.9738,4.7646,1.8296,2.6853,5.604,2.0121,1.4192,3.7508,2.2205,1.8264,4.6316,5.582,0.7655,0.3564,1.6418,2.7642,0.3297,3.9131,1.9589,3.4711,0.1468,4.8722,1.4409,1.2349,2.891,1.488,0.8148,5.9936,1.161,4.3937,1.9227,1.005,0.1523,7.9572,1.097,2.5095,1.3477,1.6811,0.9461,1.7636,3.4037,5.1763,1.5808,2.3946,1.1546,0.2545,2.336,3.2284,1.7639,0.7136,2.2824]}

The dogs, however, are shocked to see how evil humans are. And the puppies find other puppies who are not so special, even more terrifying, only when they meet the human children. What happens when you bring a girl into the world and decide how and who she is going to be a mom? How do you see and treat human children differently, because they are not puppies anymore but women, and how is this done? I think people are too selfish ; you should think less about yourself and more about other people, not only dogs. And these are a very interesting questions which the author of this story was kind enough to raise. My heart went out when I read the story. I have always wished for such a dog that could understand humans so well. But the fact that even the big dogs are scared of the humans, this is very good, because it makes us to be more careful and considerate about human beings, and see how much we are just like a dog. The book makes you realize how much you want a dog or a child and that you can live without it. But it has a different meaning when you receive it with open arms.\n\u201cAs I wrote my article on the day of the new year, I was struck by how I had been able to stay unscathed from the last year thus far. I was surprised to have managed to put my family and career on hold, to be so flexible, and to accept not a single challenge on my list. I was, on the whole, still the same person on January 1st, 2020 as I was on December 31st, 2019 \u2013 thankfully and without pain. I thought I had finally gotten control of my stress. My body and minds were finally ready. But I still felt like an adrenaline junkie.\n\u201cThe following day, when everyone was back to work from Christmas, the stress and anxiety hit. I\u2019m not an anxious person by any means. I could, in fact, be described as a very positive and happy person. This year, it appeared as though I\u2019d be the exception. Instead of turning to anxiety medication for comfort, I took to meditating. And yet, despite my best efforts, it still felt like my body and mind were not under control. It still felt like there was a constant adrenaline rush, a sense of tension in my muscles, and a need to do more and more, faster and faster, even when I didn\u2019t feel like it.","token_len":525,"entropy":[8.4374,2.558,0.031,11.5885,0.0181,9.3203,2.2125,5.8043,6.6587,5.2418,1.4768,4.6868,1.4253,5.5458,6.5681,0.4,8.7171,1.2544,3.2434,3.5002,4.6933,3.4444,0.0624,0.8954,9.3767,1.78,1.7821,2.7662,9.1134,4.1036,0.8907,0.8625,4.5391,2.736,5.8833,6.2744,6.1659,7.221,3.3909,1.0612,3.5155,2.232,5.3951,2.3949,3.5813,2.2068,4.6833,2.6175,7.0337,4.2797,0.6795,4.9658,2.0872,3.1109,4.616,0.6491,4.8393,3.4482,0.8648,2.3851,4.2675,2.0502,5.9197,1.5886,1.4495,1.1217,1.6369,5.9188,5.668,5.3692,3.6509,1.2351,0.9701,4.1862,0.008,0.727,4.551,6.2455,1.3588,3.2316,1.9354,0.3079,6.0455,5.6926,2.9543,5.5935,0.661,5.3865,2.9636,5.2373,1.6836,0.5947,2.6112,7.7197,4.5974,4.0157,6.4053,2.4758,2.0009,2.5282,4.3659,2.1368,6.0009,0.7364,3.8737,2.5685,4.9987,1.8745,4.766,6.5734,11.801,4.8465,4.2915,4.0343,5.877,1.0929,4.9299,1.0291,1.4464,0.0982,3.8014,0.4572,2.2071,2.8633,2.675,2.7215,1.567,3.7743,5.7881,1.6613,4.7904,2.4366,4.0473,1.1198,4.9584,3.9279,4.2433,3.4308,1.0493,4.8472,4.0577,6.1045,0.0115,0.0055,5.4096,0.6662,5.5452,4.993,4.9439,0.0173,8.0634,0.446,0.5864,1.569,2.291,1.1118,1.2765,3.2086,3.1353,5.8797,1.7047,3.9845,0.8958,6.1292,4.1897,1.8536,3.7841,3.4322,4.0345,1.3586,0.768,3.0323,3.2654,3.3761,0.8443,6.0774,2.5577,7.424,1.1239,1.837,3.3895,0.9652,3.5128,1.0095,2.2324,4.7414,1.543,4.1502,4.4637,2.8855,1.9881,1.6372,2.7783,2.5619,6.0715,2.5913,1.9147,4.3456,1.9609,4.3241,2.3552,2.9831,3.1854,2.1465,2.1284,1.4464,6.723,1.9817,3.1631,1.6354,2.0777,5.342,1.92,4.2089,1.8612,0.6914,3.0342,3.2649,4.1401,2.4781,1.9427,1.5422,1.4577,2.1565,4.095,2.9145,1.1315,5.9433,0.8337,4.1965,3.7435,2.9758,1.2986,1.9576,4.7573,3.3526,2.2122,0.6296,3.9617,2.6041,4.2671,2.024,4.5854,2.5117,2.9349,0.5515,8.447,1.1932,4.2964,4.3645,0.4012,0.7135,3.1381,10.318,7.7311,7.2899,2.2702,3.7581,3.3184,3.9884,2.2111,1.4563,6.5776,1.1062,0.5009,5.631,3.4438,0.4891,0.9203,1.8526,5.9716,0.2529,1.3862,3.8896,2.5423,2.41,3.1577,0.007,5.157,11.1536,0.0125,1.4247,1.0872,6.7388,2.0294,9.6995,0.2705,0.364,1.1434,2.06,4.7193,1.5388,4.342,5.1744,0.1098,5.5797,2.389,4.5735,2.0966,6.286,2.1949,0.6453,2.2395,2.5558,2.3129,4.1476,6.6844,2.1827,1.8571,1.3123,5.9563,5.8954,4.5331,0.5136,5.7698,5.1365,0.5104,7.2041,0.9104,1.1359,1.9253,5.525,4.1027,0.4899,1.1664,0.016,5.3161,4.5108,2.0752,0.8409,5.9044,5.3126,1.1739,0.5969,0.9734,8.5364,4.6835,0.6132,0.3228,1.0642,3.2765,1.9614,0.0204,0.3458,5.4022,6.5734,8.9431,5.7216,3.885,6.9979,0.8119,1.3861,4.7205,1.7648,1.5311,3.1741,3.4639,7.7696,0.4824,0.3874,5.5266,2.0793,3.8024,2.9923,3.3236,7.2639,0.6794,4.5444,2.9504,2.9072,2.6431,1.4403,2.4897,1.6994,2.037,3.353,8.562,1.1141,0.0015,1.1161,3.0274,1.9526,0.1641,2.6659,4.9179,1.4666,0.7626,3.9787,6.7668,0.9469,4.159,2.2692,2.1228,5.0362,5.482,1.3216,3.3809,4.9364,3.6218,1.402,4.0718,2.0614,1.0236,16.1147,9.5702,3.5604,2.5268,5.5623,3.67,0.2143,5.3675,0.2152,0.1335,0.9791,0.6568,5.4546,5.4144,2.7242,0.1661,0.0848,1.4725,8.1361,0.1504,1.6273,3.0944,5.0916,2.9868,3.1793,0.1676,0.6769,4.3299,4.2708,1.0447,3.3033,6.6626,2.1937,1.0993,0.9203,4.9704,0.9947,2.5038,2.7751,3.093,5.3579,1.0312,5.3637,0.6433,6.3137,1.8809,5.6651,3.4643,2.7248,6.2791,0.5095,0.4365,2.9732,2.8758,6.0389,0.5926,1.444,3.63,5.763,0.5701,4.1276,1.6109,2.6424,0.122,0.3121,3.0505,2.2192,1.5731,0.8158,2.7479,1.4588,2.7603,0.2066,0.431,2.2476,6.4692,1.1208,0.4415,2.6409,4.0252,0.2876,0.5614,3.7665,0.3606,1.9372,3.9773,7.2465,0.0902,1.8847,2.8341,3.584,0.1221,4.89,3.0216,0.3023,4.2283,0.8732,1.0746,1.3408,4.0786,0.3128,4.1049,2.3246,2.41,0.5763,3.3096,7.3845,0.6627,0.3896,1.3958,3.8881,2.0045,0.5889,2.9776,2.6523,1.0966,0.0459,1.38,1.6467,1.4271,0.2157]}

The most cunning Satan can find a way that you won \u2019 t know any better. So pay attention to the subtle temptations... Because we do have a choice.\nThe more we deny our natural desire to be free and happy, the greater the burden we put on the Devil \u2019 s shoulders. And so we see him working relentlessly in order to get us stuck in the Devil \u2019 s trap \u2013 to create an addiction. And that addiction \u2026 it is often the addiction of anger, resentment and blame. We allow the Devil to seduce with anger, resentment and blame.\nTherefore keep your eyes open, to see if the way you think is not controlled by anger. If your anger does not feed you from inside, but only from the outside, that angered thought is not real, because it is controlled by the Devil.\nSometimes... the Devil does not put the temptations \u2013 the deceptions \u2013 in front of you, but the temptations arrive in the shape of feelings : feeling envy, feeling that you are not happy, feeling shame because you are not doing more, feeling unworthy, that everything is wrong, feeling hopeless and useless, feeling that you have lost all hope. Feelings like that are deceptive \u2013 they lead us into a dead end tunnel.\nSometimes... the Devil does not put the temptations \u2013 the deceptions \u2013 in front of you, but the temptations arrive in a hidden way. He steals your happiness away from you, without knowing how.\nHe sneaks in the back of your mind.. making you think that you are a victim. Feeling that there is no way back to the road to true happiness... the road to a loving, caring, responsible, warm and open relationship.\nIn your eyes, you see another person and you say, I should have been more... That person is not an example in your opinion. You see different sides of other people and then make them responsible for what you did... instead of asking yourself :\nYou see the same person again, and then say to yourself that there is something wrong with you and that you are not worthy of love... And that you deserve this person. The person you see now is not an example in your opinion. And when you look at them with a critical eye, what you see is not good, but you believe you have lost the right to try again. And then, you don\u2019t get out of that negative, judgmental circle, because that person can no longer make you feel as if you are the victim.","token_len":525,"entropy":[10.1226,8.2329,0.1887,5.9982,2.5035,2.1074,0.6738,5.1736,1.3209,10.0337,2.4006,3.1822,6.9259,5.8833,5.7274,3.2323,4.1013,7.8026,0.3382,7.0492,3.874,2.7527,18.2853,5.8878,8.2898,5.2586,6.1257,0.7726,1.0177,4.9041,7.9514,1.857,1.0389,1.622,6.697,7.5152,0.0035,7.008,6.8288,4.6628,4.5827,2.7114,1.5693,4.5014,1.0368,3.1256,5.5183,6.8333,2.8899,8.222,2.1848,6.7808,4.4675,1.6293,1.6802,3.2484,2.6926,3.0082,0.3108,0.0966,2.9885,0.9837,6.2567,1.8887,3.4748,0.198,3.5498,2.1524,4.1732,0.2228,5.59,7.4354,0.4203,3.204,3.0634,2.0308,4.9552,2.8079,5.9098,5.7774,2.898,2.7552,0.0345,3.0279,2.2133,7.111,1.0631,1.5163,5.6235,4.4692,0.0205,0.0684,3.1163,6.5587,2.4873,5.2089,3.1509,5.669,2.84,2.4787,2.5353,1.1796,7.5632,3.9561,1.5687,5.3038,2.6596,5.6829,1.1743,6.6986,1.1668,3.9487,1.7158,6.6393,0.741,3.3663,6.8982,1.7704,0.192,0.2299,7.063,0.0034,7.4748,4.4833,0.7859,1.1266,0.3061,0.0925,0.8944,2.3711,6.8146,7.2912,1.6237,1.3196,0.9393,1.7883,4.9061,0.9781,1.9969,2.0552,6.8623,1.5259,3.7588,1.5193,4.7012,8.5763,0.7661,6.0435,3.0361,2.5081,3.4373,4.63,4.4088,0.0573,7.312,2.7945,5.2724,2.6588,0.4894,4.8808,3.7994,3.196,1.9781,1.5529,0.2808,3.6986,10.8121,6.7497,1.8246,2.2369,5.6831,1.9778,3.4253,1.0337,0.6674,5.4873,0.3093,1.0325,0.6292,0.7602,1.3426,5.618,8.8573,2.3863,0.9444,3.4175,0.7391,6.2241,2.5676,6.7654,0.0069,7.4158,1.172,8.1869,0.41,2.3339,1.7736,1.8182,0.0047,0.6545,1.6119,0.9159,4.349,2.1287,0.0109,10.1714,1.4696,1.3382,4.7955,0.0461,5.2942,8.8196,5.3214,6.5396,0.3026,3.023,6.07,0.9683,0.8587,2.124,4.1722,0.6512,0.1925,3.9676,5.6781,0.5005,1.0654,0.9484,3.5076,6.2267,2.2158,0.127,7.8811,1.6325,7.3552,6.217,0.7201,2.9216,1.1556,1.0834,3.9994,2.5225,5.7888,0.9678,0.4761,1.618,0.6101,2.0733,2.9721,2.4407,1.1001,1.8025,6.1986,0.8743,3.4578,2.5148,1.2389,6.6731,5.0744,1.2725,5.7197,1.8679,2.1082,2.0573,8.2005,0.2933,11.5559,0.965,0.9824,3.5523,3.3965,0.8153,0.3835,1.2322,0.0667,1.1846,0.2653,0.152,0.0052,0.7401,0.0046,0.0151,0.0004,0.2037,0.0115,0.0009,0.0006,0.1126,0.0285,0.0147,0.0039,0.0012,0.0055,0.0844,0.0042,6.2899,6.9563,1.7889,1.4797,4.69,8.2744,1.2901,4.5648,5.2331,0.8026,0.0387,0.9849,5.8365,3.3496,2.9999,1.6894,2.0407,3.5326,8.2122,0.0924,1.4332,3.4384,4.288,0.4866,0.9361,0.5989,7.9646,6.6377,0.6457,2.0241,1.1278,0.5622,0.4697,3.5664,4.6337,1.6832,7.1278,2.0353,4.7081,0.292,1.0475,1.986,3.8612,2.4625,1.525,7.5538,2.7812,6.1603,0.1445,4.4734,3.6471,6.504,0.5227,3.1262,5.7911,1.4724,3.8455,0.7443,4.7879,0.8113,7.4239,1.428,6.3638,3.1653,1.1917,0.862,4.1512,4.2022,4.6303,0.5051,1.4724,2.7931,6.7809,2.2728,4.3469,2.0175,3.5039,1.0179,4.763,4.9305,2.5147,2.1489,1.9958,5.6415,5.6488,2.7501,1.2319,1.7312,5.0471,4.649,4.5405,1.0907,9.0539,1.0402,2.1249,2.0589,7.6048,4.7227,0.4847,7.0253,0.0824,1.9049,5.1175,5.9238,3.0108,7.9025,0.7426,2.3716,1.2107,3.6097,3.978,5.8033,0.1318,4.5863,2.0895,5.9595,4.6987,4.0637,3.8324,2.3381,3.525,0.9859,3.2802,1.9193,1.8631,3.0073,2.0231,3.1531,0.2134,4.3415,3.7504,0.3432,2.782,0.327,0.4597,0.5723,2.6377,1.127,0.6434,2.0784,1.292,3.9005,0.422,2.1693,2.941,4.6187,2.4649,0.8403,5.3885,4.7234,3.2178,2.3723,3.7966,2.5783,1.4851,1.4974,2.826,0.6552,0.9035,2.8801,0.2019,1.0456,0.0775,0.6465,0.6933,4.5578,4.285,0.4713,2.8437,0.8577,3.0298,4.1407,2.3569,4.9912,0.1636,0.3323,5.5068,0.8679,0.2149,0.5307,1.3713,5.2931,1.7038,1.0251,4.7277,5.56,3.1023,2.3819,3.7281,2.4428,3.2294,0.2524,8.1945,2.8263,0.497,2.883,2.9513,2.5889,1.931,4.9214,4.9685,1.4527,3.7791,4.8078,4.536,0.4733,2.7803,6.4991,3.2954,6.3092,0.1237,7.2969,2.4131,1.6683,3.4088,1.3025,4.2813,3.7603,0.032,4.3371,0.9412,1.2358,5.2649,0.901,0.2734,0.5466,3.4949,3.222,0.8589]}

Enjoy your life my dear and we shall be in touch when I come back here.\nWe were all excited to hear that you were going to have a guest posting event on your blog. When we saw your post, we all felt a twinge of sadness and that was before we realized you're a retired military, who is doing something she loves! That was a hard moment...but then we all learned more about you, and now we feel a happy feeling that you have found something that makes you so happy to do. Love and congratulations to you, and looking forward to your future posts.\nHi there, I've read the post several times and I never commented because I figured it was too late to write to you, but I just wanted to say thank you for sharing some of your journey with us. I'm sure some of the things that have crossed your mind aren't new to anyone, but for me it was nice and refreshing to read a post like this and to see how the road ahead looks. I didn't know how to reply to your post in the comment section, but since this is the only forum I'm aware of that I can still access, I wanted to say congratulations for starting this blog, and to keep posting. Keep up the good work and thanks again for sharing.\nYes, I too am very grateful for the feedback I've received, as well as the support. And I'm grateful to everyone that reads my posts. All the best, and thank you for reading!\nThis post gave me a few insights into what you've been up to, and I enjoy reading about your experiences.\nThanks so much. To me the road ahead means, that now they are looking at me, and when it comes time to put together my portfolio the world will start to show its side. Thanks, and looking forward to your future posts.","token_len":527,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.7691,0.6601,1.4998,1.2654,2.7375,3.2525,0.4964,8.7579,3.121,2.0937,0.2095,2.1307,7.7457,1.5801,0.5292,6.1273,2.2648,0.0181,0.0005,0.402,3.3608,3.3786,3.0929,2.5133,0.7315,3.1044,1.1532,4.8695,1.6129,0.2663,5.3763,1.422,1.7774,10.7325,0.2007,3.8183,0.9073,2.3161,5.3535,2.043,3.8743,3.5815,2.1839,2.7891,1.8397,1.5989,1.6963,1.1031,5.5595,2.291,6.5955,0.2869,3.8266,7.1548,0.5106,3.3623,3.3561,3.9713,0.0005,3.9165,3.1656,5.9077,3.7806,0.3095,4.8026,4.0692,5.5678,1.8229,0.4065,2.6537,2.6088,2.3114,3.1838,0.816,2.2956,0.2919,2.3242,1.6161,2.5326,3.7399,0.9643,0.9262,5.3899,1.0002,4.7845,1.4811,5.236,2.9551,5.8421,9.5627,3.5928,1.3095,5.4833,2.18,0.2179,4.3916,1.9542,5.7395,0.3389,5.7955,2.1233,5.895,5.2217,4.7709,4.5666,0.1816,0.964,4.5375,1.6966,3.9637,1.0665,2.1329,9.9152,6.0882,1.4992,3.0468,7.2215,2.7149,3.4592,0.187,4.6813,1.1951,4.5645,3.8271,3.6485,0.6368,1.3645,3.2783,0.6637,3.0727,6.0061,2.2518,3.4285,6.3226,3.7223,0.4944,2.1306,1.416,2.5347,4.7703,2.0518,0.8546,1.8633,7.4712,10.0337,0.8359,6.9705,2.2533,5.1344,8.5463,1.6482,4.7058,3.4422,4.2308,3.6695,4.1411,1.4032,3.6853,3.573,3.1963,0.3149,4.0791,0.7545,0.804,3.6019,3.3082,3.1311,4.111,0.8062,3.3844,1.7035,0.9315,1.5339,2.8303,0.1926,4.1094,0.7738,4.9578,7.2641,5.931,2.3544,2.8557,2.3562,1.1875,5.6262,2.0105,3.3779,1.621,2.3963,1.3505,0.5291,2.9292,3.0126,1.6476,5.1808,0.0154,0.0354,2.9191,1.8708,5.0536,2.42,4.918,0.7194,3.3277,1.8866,3.3583,2.3809,6.4237,4.8619,4.6179,4.7141,2.3726,4.4136,3.7886,6.2313,1.8445,4.7619,4.2393,1.5756,2.3673,5.7397,4.5743,6.7759,3.0254,3.4444,1.258,2.2588,4.9045,4.0829,0.3384,0.6619,2.3356,0.8684,2.9222,0.8966,3.2067,2.294,5.6555,3.029,2.7747,0.6391,2.8457,3.4066,3.6964,2.2604,2.863,0.447,3.7388,1.0553,2.629,3.9343,3.5206,6.3145,2.3924,6.9273,1.0822,0.4232,2.0493,1.8163,8.4681,0.0905,0.0142,2.0746,2.8582,2.3163,0.9466,0.7155,5.518,2.6566,0.8079,1.3518,3.5555,4.8412,3.4153,2.3564,6.307,0.0522,1.7062,1.3178,5.9627,8.7662,4.8388,0.5226,5.8225,1.2928,1.3133,2.7069,3.277,1.0334,2.8688,3.989,0.2423,2.3901,0.6469,0.8884,3.4508,0.6856,0.0091,1.0506,1.8312,0.0073,0.6799,2.7019,4.3605,0.4825,0.7022,6.7625,1.0673,0.3662,0.6382,1.2478,2.2074,2.4467,3.8347,0.2346,3.038,2.4665,2.0308,2.5413,6.668,0.652,0.3863,5.8082,0.0002,4.296,1.4156,5.7071,1.0864,0.3724,3.9064,1.3194,1.6154,0.9488,4.3775,3.9715,4.2826,0.2738,3.9003,2.8784,0.7134,1.6412,0.6043,2.4165,2.0282,1.3487,2.5504,3.9851,7.0699,4.7582,4.5338,1.2464,1.4058,5.308,0.0006,1.2991,2.4766,1.1222,4.9818,1.1224,2.3067,0.7737,4.3494,1.6,6.5993,0.2091,0.8672,0.6273,5.0979,3.9144,0.7176,2.588,3.7526,4.6021,1.3814,2.2031,3.1691,0.0071,1.7814,2.2314,3.0784,5.2058,5.0744,1.1951,0.5867,3.571,0.0388,2.6084,6.4114,3.6006,6.1922,1.2464,2.6743,2.2849,0.9023,2.5853,5.4086,4.9823,2.3678,5.5924,1.2349,0.0313,0.2925,0.0173,2.1841,4.5734,2.4313,0.9592,1.6623,2.1074,0.8772,6.2758,0.374,1.0607,8.2542,1.3355,3.7272,2.4551,0.621,1.6629,4.3605,2.4168,1.1458,0.6214,2.7519,3.2219,1.7597,0.0324,1.1101,2.5835,3.5072,3.9324,1.5315,2.0079,4.0592,1.384,2.3601,2.1565,5.8617,1.1868,1.0559,1.4353,5.2196,1.7666,2.2385,0.7303,2.2063,3.4532,0.0191,0.7886,2.3168,2.4476,0.7535,4.3678,2.0273,8.4857,0.1868,1.2335,3.6047,4.3731,0.9483,2.3963,2.9493,3.0923,0.4164,0.2516,0.0227,2.0139,0.7581,1.4653,7.4922,2.3634,1.9069,2.222,2.6474,1.1637,2.6105,4.7969,2.6221,0.0099,3.5116,6.4944,3.5263,3.9382,5.0594,0.6014,7.256,5.0369,2.6929,5.6337,6.639,1.8788,3.8255,1.8011,3.626,1.7443,1.0245,5.7415,3.7384,0.9263,2.6661,0.2721,4.361,4.0186,3.1653,4.8836,5.8736,4.3103,1.1065,4.6758,0.8412,5.4259,3.9899,4.3045,0.7109,5.9787,3.4136,1.331,7.9984,0.0956,0.0415,1.9215,1.3897,0.1893,0.662]}

A v shaped neckline and a lace up front will entice all eyes on.\nThis entry was posted in Blog, Coaching, Health and Wellness, Nutrition, Weight Loss Coaching and tagged Eating healthy, Health, healthy lifestyle transformation, Nutrition, weight loss on April 16, 2015 by Tracy.\nPosted on April 12, 2016 January 22, 2019 Written by adminCategories News - NewsTags airmen, air force, airborne, bomber, defence, F-22, f-35, F-35B, f-35c, jf-17, missile, missile defence, missile defence programme, missiles, Navy, patrol plane, strike, US, weaponry\nYou are here: Home \/ News \/ News from the Parish \/ News Articles \/ Communion (March 2018): A few more details\u2026","token_len":527,"entropy":[11.0987,4.9729,4.9964,5.8998,4.6084,3.939,0.9281,4.1449,2.2054,3.5225,5.485,3.6243,0.7774,1.5513,1.5229,5.4505,5.4495,0.9186,7.0936,3.9142,6.5971,1.1937,4.0273,2.3581,5.5879,2.2167,0.3973,0.8508,13.6328,2.6831,3.5601,0.062,5.6341,0.1087,0.2869,2.7531,2.2827,1.1646,0.6534,0.8583,1.4978,0.7914,3.1925,3.4491,3.1559,5.4232,0.8347,1.6659,0.9417,6.084,7.9549,0.2236,3.318,3.2571,0.0028,2.5897,2.4401,1.0948,3.0412,4.9955,2.4841,4.0503,1.4757,6.1458,0.5995,2.604,1.3058,2.1924,0.531,9.9731,1.3077,5.8076,0.5847,0.0547,2.8743,0.9968,1.4371,4.2597,1.3001,1.9803,1.6387,3.8137,0.8102,3.0245,1.9933,1.1521,0.2176,0.6706,3.6833,1.7926,5.3338,4.4223,0.1733,5.0635,1.6359,2.1002,4.5235,1.4932,6.3593,1.1489,0.0,0.002,8.7278,4.402,1.6268,3.3264,1.2369,5.5266,5.7301,0.7949,1.6219,4.1527,2.9425,3.1244,3.5373,8.2148,10.9445,5.2085,0.5058,7.4376,2.0914,5.6997,2.632,0.1789,1.6171,2.4928,1.7059,1.7202,7.8449,0.0603,1.1672,2.0185,5.9215,0.9746,0.1284,0.5333,0.3746,0.8682,6.3815,2.381,3.06,1.0536,3.8464,1.3427,3.8802,0.6461,2.754,1.2302,6.1137,2.3818,1.3904,6.474,1.1312,2.5483,4.2972,0.0007,1.8527,0.4339,8.0586,2.2097,2.3589,1.9061,2.9918,3.7326,7.1099,9.9075,0.3024,2.1503,4.6619,0.8578,2.5331,0.6165,2.9931,0.1702,0.5154,4.8327,0.6894,1.4184,1.5639,5.6,0.3765,3.8788,4.7509,4.2288,9.754,0.003,5.4816,0.7367,1.8129,0.9894,1.2352,7.6112,3.8151,2.7155,2.1609,5.965,1.48,4.5952,0.1296,2.3051,2.7674,2.1535,4.3744,6.003,4.8317,1.3772,7.1243,3.5409,8.4082,0.0312,3.5859,4.8126,2.6819,3.8865,4.8741,0.5118,1.4825,1.6049,1.8414,7.3134,0.4458,0.0885,0.434,0.527,3.2465,5.0856,7.9012,6.0641,3.5119,0.0521,6.5689,6.4789,0.7438,0.3238,4.2236,2.9846,0.8963,1.9031,4.5619,1.938,6.4466,1.114,1.2333,6.1399,0.806,3.6021,0.2781,0.4895,2.0177,1.8248,2.0432,1.2963,3.8464,8.2074,1.1494,5.9721,1.2298,4.2108,0.0565,2.2913,4.3538,1.1902,4.1791,0.0027,5.0462,1.819,2.1443,0.1121,1.4437,2.6951,0.1125,6.1809,4.8728,4.2433,2.0062,0.8271,1.4487,3.5923,5.8195,2.4862,4.2727,1.5041,6.4884,4.0427,2.7876,2.408,3.1626,1.6812,0.8911,0.6312,7.1915,0.4847,3.0714,1.1006,1.6523,0.846,0.2443,2.3011,1.0627,2.9052,2.7041,1.1783,0.0063,3.4297,3.009,0.7557,5.8542,0.5554,1.2547,0.0997,0.6228,0.7792,3.7782,5.3778,5.1091,3.1908,3.195,5.5055,9.8351,4.7883,9.1888,11.3764,11.1982,2.871,3.1169,11.0223,2.5194,5.7617,5.3628,1.9367,2.0745,1.4218,5.0247,4.385,4.3738,1.2721,2.5021,3.4756,1.0229,4.868,2.4155,2.6514,5.4592,2.1309,6.9371,7.8819,4.5612,1.7779,7.6677,3.2749,3.6005,2.7174,0.9726,1.2369,1.2056,8.2921,0.1403,4.4387,0.8202,1.1403,4.0456,4.7238,3.888,4.6561,1.9614,2.1323,1.9455,4.8217,2.6441,3.3587,2.7247,7.8654,0.0865,5.1773,6.2361,4.5768,5.1677,1.0909,2.5304,8.5391,0.7954,0.0186,4.6328,7.6678,4.1223,8.5279,2.6536,0.8106,6.7738,1.2729,2.9725,0.3898,1.3114,7.785,0.935,6.9837,0.6245,9.2203,0.127,1.7073,13.022,9.5395,5.4823,1.7484,4.8413,1.5978,6.8922,5.0096,11.7015,2.0288,4.7918,1.0131,4.4657,0.0784,6.4965,6.8838,3.7481,1.1093,2.2808,4.5539,9.1758,2.6879,1.0365,5.0014,3.1621,1.2274,4.137,0.5547,2.8017,9.9921,3.5595,0.2085,6.7558,7.9213,0.2727,8.1297,8.964,5.6653,7.5872,4.5009,4.7193,9.1922,11.4739,7.8034,2.6137,4.0074,4.1219,0.963,8.0551,1.3827,9.2612,0.5799,7.5392,0.3602,6.8667,0.6762,2.6925,1.0043,4.8534,0.6561,0.9788,0.328,2.3964,0.0641,1.0,2.1905,0.2517,4.9369,0.0913,0.3343,5.8306,0.1409,6.6506,5.7523,0.0345,3.2643,0.3131,5.8828,0.8125,2.9265,2.4633,0.1467,3.1652,1.8216,7.4625,0.2065,4.2794,0.361,7.1457,0.4238,6.6259,3.2856,0.1457,6.0815,3.0654,5.595,1.9974,8.7599,3.1475,5.4085,2.3231,4.2776,0.1358,3.992,4.4062,2.5322,1.3965,2.2865,5.7485,1.7728,13.4388,1.9093,1.9238,5.1685,1.4621,9.0177,2.711,5.1653,7.501,2.707,4.9662,4.1066,5.5501,3.9408,4.1695,6.1385]}

Love is a choice. Love is willing to go to the sacrifice, as the other doesn't matter, no matter what happens with us. It takes more than a look. It takes time and trust.\u201d \u2013 D.K\n\u201cWe make a life together that's nothing like what we had before. We're nothing like we were before we started the fight.

But what could you do? What do I mean? What you don't do.

What you don't do.\u201d \u2013 K.Lee\n\u201cI always tried to play my music the way I thought it sounded. So, when everyone who heard it said the sounds looked ugly, I was disappointed.

{"prompt":"Hitler never actually died . After decades of intense reconstructive surgery . He puts on a toupee to become Donald Trump . The only person who sees through his surgery is ... Vladimir Putin","text":"Hitler never actually died. After decades of intense reconstructive surgery. He puts on a toupee to become Donald Trump. The only person who sees through his surgery is... Vladimir Putin.\"\nTrump's comments came amid a wave of anger and fury over the murder of Black Lives Matter activist George Floyd in Minnesota by police. At least 41 people have been killed in protests this summer.\nWearing a face mask is more important for Trump than it is for all of us who are still breathing. If, however, Trump's mask was made out of metal or plated with rhodium; or if it was made of the precious stuff that keeps the Queen and all of her family members warm while they are in Parliament, we would be a long way from the day-to-day realities of today. If we had the technology to make the mask of that sort, then the world would, perhaps, be a bit easier to live in. But here, for the sake of public health, everybody has to be nice and civil.\nMy dear readers, let us not forget: Trump's mask is more important for political purposes than it is for public health. That is not just a matter of opinions. According to the New York Times, Trump is \"confident\" that there is not a single person who can see his mask without knowing for sure that it is not his real face.\nThe other day, the Washington Post reported: \"Trump and his administration are not in favor of masks. But there has not been any discussion about the use of masks with federal ministers -- for fear of embarrassment.\"\nThat is why the mask is a political good of much greater significance than a public health good. We can all agree about the necessity of social distancing and washing our hands, and this is an invaluable public health service. But our common sense is not good enough for Trump.\nHe has to be allowed to wear his mask and keep the country safe from serious infectious diseases because of all of the jobs and money that this particular administration has given to his face protection. If we, in our common sense, want to say that the mask of this administration is bad public health policy, I would ask myself why did we, with this government and this administration, get this mask?\nIn summary: as a matter of common sense and as a matter of social policy, wearing a mask on the street is no longer required, whereas as a matter of political manipulation, for the sake of power and money this mask is always good. But our government wants power, the military wants money, and the dictator wants power.","token_len":527,"entropy":[8.1681,7.8359,4.6622,4.14,1.1355,5.2042,7.1534,0.2054,6.4845,10.6909,0.7191,3.6785,6.7349,2.1067,10.2597,2.2429,1.0089,9.5157,0.0448,3.4856,5.5999,8.0562,0.106,1.8521,3.3934,4.0989,3.1355,1.0096,6.0401,6.6043,1.3645,7.6211,0.6971,8.2149,7.6809,0.0467,3.8812,0.5471,12.5905,1.7494,5.2141,2.608,3.5365,1.3127,4.7111,0.0036,4.8315,2.3232,4.1594,1.6634,1.5045,6.2277,0.1223,8.3989,0.6049,0.0186,2.0538,8.8563,17.2003,3.8219,5.4201,5.4639,1.4925,1.5541,4.6992,1.8591,5.5295,0.2332,1.2567,0.1279,0.3673,1.1478,4.8701,4.4164,3.1956,2.4972,0.6685,12.6282,2.5925,1.0196,6.4548,0.2281,5.2795,5.8512,5.0037,3.7489,2.5337,0.3585,3.245,0.5507,0.1357,5.6489,1.559,1.0578,2.5159,2.6845,3.8254,7.6544,0.5679,4.7171,5.5582,3.8052,0.0047,2.6567,2.4628,4.8866,2.9828,4.162,2.7718,0.063,4.6752,2.3976,7.8206,1.2116,1.3762,7.7477,1.7256,0.1333,8.2578,3.5989,0.2053,2.8334,0.8219,1.1873,1.992,4.1164,6.7028,6.0188,1.4281,3.4858,1.8527,8.8149,3.9908,4.1883,1.2925,1.1567,2.2623,3.4686,3.8577,4.9594,1.6806,2.136,1.8026,8.7949,1.6636,3.1273,1.4482,1.6265,4.318,5.2086,0.2794,0.4647,2.6026,5.0673,5.5862,0.1539,0.0006,0.0014,3.1313,0.3815,4.4663,0.3792,4.6106,2.0656,3.3154,2.7752,5.869,0.7555,2.0466,2.6876,1.0864,3.3517,4.8772,2.736,0.4993,3.0459,2.9583,2.5134,0.3099,7.1126,4.542,0.1907,0.6237,0.7571,4.855,4.3269,1.146,1.6876,0.6425,0.3695,2.8654,5.6688,2.641,3.771,1.2402,2.5671,0.002,6.3575,3.1037,0.3632,8.8275,2.1773,0.4726,2.2081,6.9032,2.5125,6.2123,1.1022,0.859,6.4093,4.8568,3.2823,0.3513,3.9674,1.5631,1.9802,1.2431,4.1214,3.7037,1.2797,2.1726,0.873,5.1037,0.166,0.8434,6.9964,2.4247,0.0697,0.8627,0.0103,0.0274,4.5044,0.0777,0.2341,4.2933,1.3191,3.0084,3.3262,1.2183,1.6968,0.0222,7.3263,1.0774,6.2251,0.0042,1.1633,4.0163,0.0835,0.0333,0.3844,2.26,2.7115,1.8063,6.5042,0.5646,1.5642,0.5483,4.1351,1.0744,4.5775,0.9536,1.2136,2.8512,1.3037,2.6526,4.2007,3.667,2.5283,3.1796,6.3867,6.3434,0.525,1.306,0.9039,0.5309,3.0797,2.8093,4.096,1.4561,0.2439,1.5675,2.9024,5.4797,1.9883,0.4571,3.0736,2.7538,0.0539,1.2973,2.8902,0.759,2.1343,4.0581,0.802,5.2991,1.1663,4.7888,4.3241,3.9379,0.0029,8.2386,2.8168,2.9635,3.5085,3.6055,4.3481,0.0915,2.0084,3.8525,1.4768,2.2762,2.0034,0.0464,2.3117,4.8802,6.2112,8.0877,8.2044,4.9302,2.4694,0.6187,5.3383,1.8781,0.9991,3.4663,1.4563,3.5694,2.0617,3.0457,1.6229,2.7326,3.4139,5.6982,6.7293,7.0417,1.7015,2.3607,1.1266,3.7388,3.1752,0.395,2.1863,0.264,3.7743,3.1046,3.313,1.6627,5.4853,1.1717,3.2597,0.2877,7.1088,11.7826,0.7556,2.2094,10.0744,1.2698,0.4449,4.0936,2.1758,4.3585,0.798,4.0831,7.7739,3.115,0.2242,4.0481,0.6553,1.6517,4.4146,6.1758,1.4187,2.5186,2.0224,3.6379,0.1052,1.9768,2.0011,1.0065,1.2822,3.9705,1.8995,2.0643,2.054,5.3042,0.181,3.1623,1.5508,0.3451,2.9654,4.3993,3.5092,4.0345,0.4174,3.0745,6.5385,6.804,0.479,5.1612,2.6543,3.6314,1.3387,0.8082,7.9316,2.7964,5.2392,1.1523,4.503,6.3763,4.9441,1.686,2.5004,1.435,3.2287,7.3516,6.7778,1.5075,3.374,1.9282,5.5214,3.0589,3.228,4.5437,0.2365,0.0899,2.6235,0.4543,6.1148,1.2216,2.3749,2.0752,2.388,4.0618,2.6315,0.4191,5.1103,6.4926,0.0191,2.138,0.3837,5.0062,2.3428,3.0545,4.3048,2.7868,4.4897,1.6615,4.5505,4.5788,3.9211,3.1234,2.9965,1.3701,2.8405,0.3013,3.7683,2.7304,1.8511,1.6086,1.03,3.6372,7.3234,1.2401,6.295,2.1146,2.8182,0.0022,3.3777,0.0541,2.2877,6.0199,0.2513,0.1518,0.0071,5.4389,3.3605,0.1552,7.3602,0.9718,0.2201,5.2235,1.2942,2.6844,0.7638,3.964,2.7671,5.6386,2.7883,7.3368,5.4759,0.1882,0.0369,0.0008,2.8014,10.2009,0.6008,6.1694,1.648,0.4498,0.001,5.4459,1.2437,2.2096,6.5657,0.4728,0.4808,6.4818,4.4028,1.528,3.7824,4.7554,4.4333,5.7472,5.3971,1.9211,4.5135,6.3907,0.5137,0.2533,0.3312,0.5778,1.09,9.4384,0.15,2.8664,0.3718]}

Level 9s, the weakest, can bend spoons a bit. Level 1s can stop time. You are the caretaker of the only level 0 in history. You get to see the past, future and present as you please. I know the history of your people - they have gone extinct - so, like I would need my people to save, you need to save yours. What I cannot know is how you are going to do that. Do we continue on the course we've been on, or do we change it?\"\nShe smiled at him. \"You might not know much about my world, but you know what you like. So I wanted to help you. Just as I helped you.\"\nShe looked at him. A look he didn't get all the time. \"Don't think just because you can do it easily doesn't mean you're able to control it. Because it was easy to keep going, it's easy to stay where you are and don't realize you're being hurt. My world has no easy way to heal. \"\nShe had never seen him as sad. He looked older. He smiled and grinned. His eyes were bright. She saw them again. She smiled, she smiled. The smile in her eyes made him smile too.\n\"I'll tell you what...\" he said. \"You have until dusk to decide. If you do not return, there will be hell to pay.\"\nAt the moment he knew she would not need to go to hell. She would die there, for the life she brought him and the life she gave him.\n\"I have to tell you... something happened the other day,\" she said, hesitant. \"We... lost the other.\"\nHe stared, not taking his eyes off her. She thought he was a bit startled, but she didn't care. She was glad for it.\n\"I had an accident the other day,\" he said. \"I had to stop when I felt it coming on. I had no idea what I was feeling or seeing.\"\nHe put him up against her so hard they wouldn't break apart, and he felt her heartbeat against his skin. He didn't know what was happening. He could feel his body start to feel numb, feel like he was going to drown his thoughts into the misty waters. But his mind stayed alert. He heard his heart pounding. He heard water - far too fast - from down under the boat he was in.","token_len":527,"entropy":[6.1473,5.895,0.5453,11.2795,1.5771,1.5557,9.8744,2.2062,2.2936,1.6934,1.552,2.4316,4.8501,6.3703,1.6019,4.4906,4.2176,5.0249,1.5252,1.5841,5.856,0.8471,9.3298,5.2523,4.0815,2.8964,4.0854,5.7714,1.5653,2.8739,6.8412,12.6208,2.2265,6.6512,1.7989,2.2908,1.2767,4.2949,0.2585,2.4236,6.6487,4.5227,1.8943,4.148,3.9681,3.5833,8.5767,0.0488,0.737,1.5726,7.6888,6.8884,5.3349,4.4714,7.2067,0.8095,2.2698,5.4696,1.1617,3.5511,1.5469,4.1184,1.5135,6.0142,1.2414,3.0141,3.0063,0.5221,4.5541,0.4486,5.3304,3.6484,3.4292,4.8226,1.139,2.8961,4.6157,5.8261,2.6567,2.6808,4.7405,5.8134,4.0888,3.4896,4.5116,5.4473,2.6304,6.495,7.832,4.7437,3.2905,0.7361,3.9738,5.7467,2.4618,3.66,0.8445,2.1631,6.1224,0.3369,4.7571,2.6343,5.5049,5.2127,0.8652,1.2584,1.698,2.7265,1.0218,0.012,2.8105,1.388,0.7079,4.6629,4.6871,6.0851,3.0562,2.9652,4.4928,2.1845,3.3455,1.6526,0.5951,1.8122,0.7878,0.7919,0.2011,3.8215,2.9164,4.609,0.6713,8.4077,3.3155,2.1129,0.8835,0.9281,0.76,2.43,4.8573,2.9095,1.9055,4.4294,0.3442,3.2135,2.7526,0.6308,0.27,1.6034,1.65,1.9207,2.8597,5.5854,1.3736,4.1782,2.7033,4.5367,0.2112,3.3371,0.5283,1.7826,5.6392,3.2261,0.8802,5.0826,0.2741,3.9663,0.326,3.205,3.1315,0.9605,0.5609,1.5269,6.1247,4.2711,3.1431,2.3029,0.0009,4.8004,5.8899,2.6433,1.4743,0.5703,1.0085,4.4756,0.0019,3.7462,7.3759,0.8933,1.1443,3.5645,2.6569,1.6353,6.8746,5.2053,0.0002,0.0971,0.5837,2.3026,5.4669,0.0264,4.6622,0.8763,0.4449,5.1173,2.9145,5.2845,5.1709,1.5658,5.3641,2.4132,2.0067,2.2193,1.7241,2.3292,0.1539,3.8029,4.5227,0.1248,0.1703,2.7257,4.6905,0.0002,5.3658,1.7176,1.0441,4.5457,5.0009,0.7464,5.8059,1.7726,2.802,4.4654,7.7247,3.05,1.0688,5.7787,1.3015,6.4009,0.253,3.0002,5.2787,4.1008,1.7783,1.3148,4.2236,6.0336,2.4888,1.5522,3.1402,6.6572,2.6365,1.6066,4.6079,2.9055,6.1278,1.079,3.9184,2.0503,0.7113,3.4126,1.7609,3.0062,4.1238,3.7026,4.1815,0.7371,2.7221,3.1488,3.7923,3.7369,1.9762,1.4724,3.4964,2.0064,5.5919,1.7538,0.6232,3.8773,0.7087,1.384,4.8018,0.2696,1.1972,1.5313,1.8361,3.3191,2.5857,0.0981,1.409,5.7983,1.8934,0.8843,1.047,1.1418,1.8527,2.9298,8.8421,8.0794,0.6041,3.9623,1.4772,2.7897,0.2192,3.0248,2.2978,7.536,1.5348,4.4194,0.9872,0.1115,5.6246,0.3617,0.0249,1.5055,0.2686,5.6446,1.6347,3.7486,2.0471,4.7057,1.9749,1.3596,2.5022,7.1207,1.0709,3.0254,2.198,3.502,0.7533,1.9541,2.1371,4.1062,3.4564,1.7222,5.0383,2.2274,5.0575,0.9984,6.7095,2.4392,3.9021,1.9799,2.1132,0.7219,1.4045,0.1821,0.2346,1.1673,1.5396,1.7019,3.411,1.8707,2.6689,0.0435,3.7426,6.3669,3.3424,6.4748,0.2731,0.4514,3.4416,0.8417,0.4112,1.8664,9.5405,0.4731,1.3947,3.6024,5.8149,5.9767,2.6224,5.0808,6.6719,0.2094,1.1947,3.8698,3.9763,4.3685,4.8444,1.8886,0.1492,0.2366,0.5132,0.4877,2.037,5.8293,1.4636,0.7984,3.651,2.9303,5.4466,1.4202,0.7346,1.8683,2.1729,0.0008,2.6134,0.2169,1.8578,2.1843,3.8937,3.706,4.2731,0.5354,1.1039,0.7707,1.5315,4.4394,3.7561,1.6503,4.6391,0.4857,0.1443,1.4834,1.0703,0.1338,0.6075,0.4242,0.9056,2.6474,1.4781,3.5125,4.9486,0.3776,3.7843,2.8041,3.4952,2.926,0.8834,0.733,2.3206,3.3511,0.4948,0.9141,2.1345,0.3443,4.5908,3.7758,6.7344,2.3666,0.2792,3.0619,4.6313,8.3305,4.6524,2.5096,2.9757,5.0914,2.7466,5.5264,5.4301,0.0003,4.4514,3.169,1.8441,1.5111,3.0819,4.3421,1.1967,5.6105,4.2944,0.2023,3.3959,0.2736,1.4911,3.1015,0.0007,1.2458,0.7826,2.496,1.4384,1.1139,1.1419,3.163,1.225,2.5983,2.4324,5.4139,0.1484,3.1246,3.7079,1.4895,6.7942,1.7819,1.316,0.3872,2.7666,0.3493,5.1107,6.7122,5.424,3.8103,2.1664,7.1824,3.9763,4.9745,0.8495,3.4295,3.6389,1.6021,4.3603,6.2924,0.9108,1.0911,4.6967,3.0323,2.3661,3.1082,1.8922,1.011,2.2536,7.7048,6.9869,7.8302,1.7952,3.1139,2.5267,5.28,5.6387,3.7984,1.4295,5.2457,6.4448,0.4947,1.8462,0.3475]}
{"prompt":"Bill Clinton lives under your bed . Describe a weekend in your life","text":"Bill Clinton lives under your bed. Describe a weekend in your life with your parents?\nMy father was a successful man who was a very proud man. He was always very busy with work. He had a big company. He always said, he had the money but he didn\u2019t have time to be with his daughter.\nIn my childhood, we spent a lot of time at the country. A good time for us. My parents were very loving parents.\nI spent the weekend with my husband at his home on the beach. We had some drinks and had a good time. We spent our weekend in a beach cottage on a quiet, very relaxing place so that we can spend a good time.\nWe take a lot of vacations. I love the beach so much that I usually don\u2019t think twice about it. We take a lot of vacations at the beach sometimes we go to some of the places near New York City. We go to the country, there is something about my father. He can\u2019t get enough of the nature.\nWhen all of the girls came and asked me about my family I thought how strange the whole thing turned out and I feel so proud to share it with them.\nI don\u2019t regret anything in life. I just regret some things, and I regret that I never said that I miss it to them. I regret that we don\u2019t talk about some things.\nNow I am happy. I don\u2019t feel in love any longer, but I know I made a mistake. That\u2019s why I feel so happy and peaceful right now.\nDo you think you were born to be a successful person? Do you think you were born to be president of the United States?\nI knew I love the work I do, I don\u2019t regret what I did. But I\u2019m not satisfied with the job I have, though, it wasn\u2019t easy to get to the point I have been.\nIn this article we are going to discuss the latest and trending tech reviews about the Sony Xperia XZ3.

Lex Luthor is actually an evil Superman. Although the name of Superman is a Greek word meaning unstoppable, Superman himself is usually referred to as a man of steel. Superman has amazing powers, but to use them, you must first give them a purpose. His powers are :\nSuperman makes a small hole in his skull and uses a gun made from a type of metal called kryptonite. Kal-El\u2019s parents did not die the same way. They died violently by a Kryptonian bomb. Kal-El is born on Earth in the city of Smallville, Kansas. It is believed that most of the people living on Krypton are children. Many scientists on Krypton believed that it was better to develop children, so they abandoned their children alive. Some of the children were adopted by humans. So the story of Kal-El is part of Kryptonian legends.\nSuperman became a hero after he was kidnapped in Smallville. The kidnappers wanted to use his powers to conquer their world. Because Kal-El has no parents to care for him, he got stuck in Smallville when he was a child. Smallville has been built in the past for humans to control planets.\nLex Luthor uses Clark Kent as a double agent for his cause. If Superman does his job and brings back the people who have been captured, he will be murdered. In this episode, I will tell you about Superman:\nSuperman is one of the most powerful super heroes of all time. In addition to his amazing abilities, Superman is also known for his attitude. He was criticized for becoming overly heroic. His first act as the world\u2019s hero was when he saved a man called Joe Kidd after he was kidnapped.","token_len":528,"entropy":[5.8096,2.2389,0.6743,2.3575,8.0251,1.6199,0.6106,7.5867,4.3551,0.1506,6.3808,2.1687,1.9957,3.4622,8.9722,1.8001,4.9579,4.2277,0.7249,9.5636,1.0877,4.0119,4.4793,0.6251,0.8613,3.2612,2.1306,1.982,7.0869,1.8969,5.2605,0.8669,1.2804,4.0389,5.3915,1.1767,2.3656,5.7395,1.5971,3.9132,1.3831,0.9191,6.022,0.3028,0.6646,3.9239,3.8272,4.0293,0.5884,3.2945,3.7521,2.4176,0.3652,4.8955,13.5753,6.7584,3.3587,0.3989,0.0822,0.8122,5.1014,2.6693,7.547,2.7151,0.1273,2.6001,2.5636,3.7837,4.157,2.5122,3.2473,6.2537,1.818,10.4513,0.05,0.4391,2.7456,3.4528,1.4336,1.4192,2.7877,1.6884,3.9157,1.5635,0.0054,0.0203,3.8108,1.7756,2.6773,1.2312,2.9629,1.0251,2.0263,2.9556,0.7289,4.3634,1.1261,0.1468,3.1615,0.966,5.0326,3.4943,5.4372,0.5465,1.2749,0.4733,4.9045,0.0359,0.1283,1.7084,4.8129,5.8433,5.0308,0.2003,1.8967,1.4926,0.0901,1.2369,3.0624,0.0366,3.3692,7.7634,0.4161,0.3636,0.8899,1.3371,1.5295,1.2007,1.4346,2.9314,0.3533,3.6112,1.0926,4.5073,5.0892,3.6667,2.0226,1.4501,1.8493,0.0025,6.412,2.6794,0.6995,4.0498,7.9915,1.5745,3.2003,0.0187,0.9299,2.0479,0.0043,0.027,0.3946,0.232,2.8863,8.6327,1.4803,6.0661,5.491,0.1208,0.0206,3.1543,3.8208,3.8866,0.0154,0.3575,1.5492,4.2938,1.8783,0.3542,7.8903,2.1078,2.3302,1.2774,3.6927,4.7562,0.0831,0.2489,3.9593,1.3717,1.3207,5.7016,3.0779,2.9844,6.3618,1.4249,5.9686,2.9195,4.7762,1.7544,2.6917,1.1878,2.0848,6.0763,0.5034,0.7299,9.0699,0.3451,2.6346,6.111,0.5696,6.1708,3.5495,0.0122,0.1413,1.6673,4.4261,1.5221,3.0702,0.589,2.0283,2.843,6.8961,1.5992,1.2195,1.5568,5.8281,3.1672,0.5422,1.5736,1.2578,1.6122,2.6005,5.8119,3.3314,2.0314,3.2526,0.332,4.8648,1.8856,0.8026,9.67,2.1337,2.4723,0.9107,6.0047,2.0391,4.9576,5.397,0.332,1.8426,5.5602,2.3277,2.5213,2.7513,5.0484,5.8027,1.5716,2.3613,6.2949,0.0324,1.4577,0.8293,5.9384,0.0134,0.2219,0.7022,4.1999,0.0351,0.0005,7.5298,0.1167,0.0676,2.7544,5.72,0.3977,3.0495,4.8452,2.2643,0.0565,1.6267,1.7517,2.7567,5.8935,4.1089,2.5428,3.822,0.4842,4.6786,1.3823,2.3507,0.0205,0.0008,2.017,5.5298,3.0792,2.4985,2.3269,1.8194,6.2172,0.1702,8.1914,0.0176,1.1654,5.4925,0.6192,3.5608,0.4587,4.1172,0.2139,6.4851,0.9139,0.548,2.5034,1.9238,1.7963,3.2,0.0055,1.4425,5.0385,1.7917,5.1793,5.4474,6.7725,1.7456,0.0182,3.532,0.2624,4.39,0.5427,6.1576,0.4542,5.6894,3.3441,3.0981,2.8436,1.3953,6.4171,1.81,1.655,8.2691,0.6506,4.3666,2.1274,0.6237,1.8427,1.8566,4.106,0.6193,3.7045,1.409,5.6528,2.5312,5.4107,1.5108,1.2705,0.0083,0.0007,1.2576,6.0876,0.1289,3.3194,2.5686,5.3662,0.5247,1.2617,2.0014,0.0433,5.3089,1.3518,2.7055,2.2669,1.9867,1.6017,4.1395,3.8835,4.6069,0.0025,1.212,2.7843,3.8801,0.3379,2.9492,0.5174,2.8215,2.2364,0.327,0.3022,5.0909,4.5801,1.4801,0.4654,5.4537,2.3584,0.0101,0.0006,3.3495,2.5738,3.228,3.6205,2.7376,0.0768,0.4951,0.1943,0.6459,5.8251,5.123,0.5175,2.5172,0.0011,5.5674,0.9562,0.3496,2.7161,1.0837,0.2077,6.218,0.0059,2.9977,2.2635,5.9663,3.3696,1.067,2.2469,3.4471,3.1507,2.1277,6.6243,6.4031,0.7842,2.9125,7.3731,0.0272,4.6015,6.8675,0.7769,2.7759,1.0535,6.7433,0.1403,2.6032,1.3558,5.5894,0.3223,5.3996,1.9737,3.7263,4.2459,0.9828,2.9175,5.4796,4.2079,1.3886,3.0946,1.5101,3.1304,1.0295,5.4327,0.6949,1.4359,0.8624,1.9648,7.5032,0.6978,3.6144,1.3417,0.1885,0.3017,2.5087,0.0473,0.4404,0.0836,4.024,3.3868,5.5458,1.2589,1.4994,0.0414,1.5683,3.5822,0.0584,0.2589,1.0699,1.1219,2.4944,0.7514,2.0151,0.446,0.0287,0.2396,3.2283,5.4904,0.1747,1.2439,4.3819,2.015,0.1697,1.1107,1.2673,0.5353,2.9286,0.8111,0.5929,7.6431,0.8661,1.4071,3.8428,6.8131,0.7443,6.1143,4.4409,7.5569,1.9653,3.6966,4.782,2.1977,1.6706,3.0502,3.733,9.9165,0.0321,0.104,4.0097,0.3005,3.8262,0.2084,3.966,2.2435,3.4031,3.8502,5.9375,10.6536,5.4365,0.9612,0.9538,2.004,1.6178]}

When I started it, it was a great game; now it's just kinda boring, and that's a shame. :( -Megan K.\nThis is the second game i have downloaded for me and it has always been fun. It makes me feel like i am living the life of a whaler, killing huge beasts to gather food, food for me is the top priority, and if i am thirsty, a lot of beer will help! Lets see if i have enough food to last the winter!\nThis is one of my favorite things. I love to play with my computer so much. I would love to win this game so much. I love to see all the animals die. And I hope that someday i can make an island. And then i would like to leave this beautiful world. Thanks for give it to us. I like playing it.

When you wake up on your 18th birthday you find out that you still have yours. You must decide to go back in time to save your friend. There, you face a choice.

I have been messing around with different maps but nothing seems to make any sense to me. Ive played against the AI a few times, and its been pretty good so far. The AI also has a bad shot though, he always shoots over everything. It doesnt make any sense to play a game where you can make shots against a wall, but I guess it might be the easiest.\nI believe I was the first person to make a mod that allows you to take back your lost powers, it was in the forum. I dont really know why you guys dont have it. I hope that you get a chance to play my mod.\nI hope you have fun with this game and I hope you do the same thing as me and play it while you still can.\nIn today\u2019s technology age, you can find it incredibly easy to reach out to prospective clients and clients simply by using the tools at your disposal. This means that it is possible to easily stay connected with your entire staff while on a business trip. In other words, having an email address for your business is essential when you\u2019re out of touch with other business associates. However, it can become difficult to keep up with the constantly changing guidelines and policies that can exist for the industry at large. Thankfully, there are a number of tips and tricks that you can use to simplify your email communication.\nMany times, many business representatives don\u2019t have email addresses that they use on an every day basis. This means that they find out they have an email address simply because it is required for a specific purpose. For example, if a person is meeting with a client or attending a conference, they can simply sign up for a business email account that they will use for that purpose. This type of email address will have an alias or a different domain, so that the recipients will still have the ability to identify it. In the same manner, if the business representative needs to create a new website, they can also do so with a business email address rather than by using their personal information or a social media account.","token_len":529,"entropy":[5.9855,8.5654,0.312,0.5175,0.3965,6.9225,11.1132,2.0808,0.7829,6.3464,7.5645,4.1805,6.4714,2.0867,0.9837,4.2414,0.9876,4.7588,0.0842,2.9498,1.4449,1.1661,0.0049,0.2013,2.6605,4.1955,1.6302,0.6631,1.3216,5.4088,0.4026,7.8156,0.7946,1.5615,4.3046,3.1982,2.6591,3.6627,1.5623,2.5189,0.0295,1.2508,2.0527,0.8708,4.3136,1.6655,4.7543,5.5217,0.8901,4.7525,2.051,2.4882,1.3319,1.4684,0.9268,3.684,3.5886,2.4689,4.5577,0.0356,2.1105,13.1334,8.8023,3.6978,8.9425,7.2319,4.8713,5.0676,0.4908,2.9548,0.7253,1.2432,1.4585,2.2695,0.0254,0.2752,4.1079,6.1988,1.8278,2.3928,5.6008,2.9642,2.3558,3.3012,2.6641,0.3543,2.1699,2.4762,3.3859,0.4284,1.8589,1.314,2.1032,5.3843,0.3183,5.3608,2.96,4.5242,2.9289,2.1532,1.6181,0.2211,1.6384,0.9373,2.9063,1.4718,1.6716,2.4217,6.6443,0.3383,0.303,2.8916,5.9345,4.2818,3.8017,2.7606,0.155,3.8353,2.3806,0.3048,2.13,0.0294,0.3794,1.4464,9.2339,3.0844,6.2226,3.0756,5.7353,4.2932,1.1987,0.0702,2.8875,1.9493,5.1666,3.0951,2.1615,2.6842,2.0777,0.038,0.2814,2.8585,1.8345,5.3381,1.6899,1.2608,5.4343,7.2321,6.6571,1.6364,5.7949,4.4594,4.1683,6.2634,5.9012,1.2309,3.2867,3.5732,2.6635,1.7521,0.0337,0.7646,3.704,3.0453,1.2945,1.5404,0.9253,1.9761,4.4033,6.5792,5.7346,2.7198,4.0806,2.0186,2.0496,2.8651,2.6886,1.8412,3.9466,0.7649,3.1173,4.9371,4.8002,1.5194,1.604,5.4703,2.625,4.4357,2.7596,1.6364,1.2374,0.4003,3.2581,1.4655,6.7647,1.343,3.1464,1.0419,0.0373,4.3536,4.0939,1.088,4.3473,1.6032,2.517,3.586,1.9709,3.8823,1.7926,6.5445,1.78,1.4927,4.6749,3.1529,1.151,2.308,2.8016,3.0188,3.1556,2.5699,2.2452,2.2175,1.3111,4.0627,2.8738,2.4992,3.7484,2.482,1.1494,0.2324,1.3205,4.9629,1.121,1.3305,1.3114,1.5264,3.0379,0.788,3.2664,1.3878,1.5263,1.4932,2.2418,1.7046,2.0664,0.7376,0.7101,4.3724,3.6793,0.2456,3.6511,4.5933,0.5852,3.5742,4.4414,1.6315,5.7368,1.095,2.5288,1.6535,0.3285,1.2507,5.521,8.036,15.1319,7.4547,3.7654,10.3636,3.422,0.6909,2.558,1.6173,4.9692,4.2772,6.9542,2.1845,0.2745,6.7948,3.5001,0.7749,10.8703,3.7941,2.0938,5.8306,6.8043,1.508,2.7793,1.381,5.7496,3.5251,0.7112,0.2921,0.2609,3.2851,2.727,0.7652,3.4843,0.8129,1.5082,0.3197,5.4642,6.8415,1.2933,1.1861,2.3903,6.7923,5.4549,3.6019,4.2021,1.8807,3.0708,0.2071,1.0305,3.6186,3.1114,0.0459,0.2944,5.7121,2.8872,3.7684,0.8976,3.9215,1.6613,3.4562,2.064,6.8442,4.1723,1.1038,17.3811,1.1997,2.3846,4.7296,2.1802,4.9055,0.7276,4.2147,3.4478,3.6533,0.4307,4.5423,0.0753,2.5022,2.9501,3.5568,2.8634,0.7805,2.6096,1.177,0.2581,1.6113,6.4502,0.3648,10.531,1.741,4.7437,1.9833,4.586,5.1227,2.2905,3.2879,3.806,2.4375,0.0229,0.3438,6.7189,0.2662,1.6174,0.664,1.7445,1.6137,0.0077,6.1343,1.1543,1.3761,1.063,1.8808,0.1184,0.4946,0.2386,6.6756,1.0629,6.6277,3.7371,0.9777,1.0415,5.3958,3.3958,1.157,5.4217,3.1261,5.1367,4.0773,2.3056,0.4009,0.0506,2.3074,3.4819,0.5985,2.6673,2.1234,2.1624,3.2397,4.4942,5.2706,0.2793,0.0252,0.4802,2.3153,1.2875,0.1314,1.7755,5.7884,4.6414,4.7296,1.4814,3.4498,0.9469,0.0398,6.4538,1.7598,2.3502,0.7186,5.2473,1.6887,3.0089,3.3181,2.8268,0.5733,2.7361,0.3123,0.0892,1.4137,2.7026,2.9229,1.9669,5.3945,0.8745,1.3139,1.8328,3.1052,5.1563,0.3989,1.6804,0.6333,0.9637,2.603,2.9067,4.3229,0.3509,0.9039,1.6027,4.1482,0.6601,2.2717,2.7661,2.0961,2.5358,0.776,2.1495,1.4174,0.0829,0.2339,2.3307,6.1437,0.0012,1.1693,1.2419,2.9878,4.2433,2.8495,7.2034,4.0008,2.0669,4.6208,4.7287,3.1324,1.7814,2.0548,2.4008,7.9886,1.963,5.1633,1.5813,1.6457,1.7446,0.0125,5.7063,4.8757,0.9937,3.2045,2.5867,3.1005,3.6584,0.2301,1.531,2.6743,2.8223,1.8625,4.1943,0.3997,4.7138,0.7806,1.4858,4.7,1.4367,0.8574,0.5755,3.4369,4.2585,0.4752,2.9977,1.4795,2.0722,0.1436,0.6451,6.8522,0.0086,5.2848,1.7374,2.7077,3.3047,4.5776,4.3764,2.6978,4.1634,0.6053,0.9786,0.1816]}

The king himself stands at the center of the cross. Everyone else must step into the arena and stand facing the king, their weapon resting on the ground, but not raised to face the king. Each player will hear the other players\u2019 movements and hear a signal if they are moving away from the king. The King shouts a word that indicates the move you have to make ( \u201crock\u201d, \u201cpaper \u201d or \u201csissors\u201d ), and then you move the sword and if the king shouts \u201csword\u201d you must stand up and face him, otherwise you must return to the center of the cross in the same position as you left. You will hear all players\u2019 responses. The player who is last still standing with a weapon in their hands is the victor. The winner will walk off the battlefield and return to his throne, while the loser will walk to the arena to be killed. Each move you decide to make will greatly change the outcome of the battle, as well as make your opponent angry. It is a truly epic encounter, a struggle of wills.\nBut there was never the slightest sign of the dark one, a thing one would normally expect in a place so full of darkness. He never made a sign of reaching out for me, even after I asked him to do so several times over. His eyes scanned the room in disbelief; \u201cWhat is wrong with her?\u201d he asked, \u201cShe can hear you, she can see you, she can smell you?!\u201d\nSoon, the man that was with the woman began to speak, in a low growling voice. \u201cDid you know that the queen had a very hard time accepting the existence of another species? She could feel the power of one of them trying to take over her consciousness, but she couldn\u2019t see or hear them, and they were unable to contact her. The queen knew no one else would be able to see or hear them, it was the only means to keep them controlled during the ritual of transition.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop the ritual\u2026\u201d The man with the golden scales looked confused, \u201cIf I don\u2019t allow it to take place, she will die.\u201d","token_len":529,"entropy":[9.0354,4.9917,5.4516,6.6541,1.9678,0.0877,3.7035,3.5244,12.4401,7.5615,2.6835,5.7791,7.3584,5.5004,1.5614,2.3738,7.2015,7.5551,2.1352,7.0182,1.315,0.8688,5.9326,1.6005,7.2293,8.0149,3.4806,3.7225,9.2643,0.8621,1.7152,1.4433,6.3922,8.7758,0.6306,1.7651,6.3689,13.9137,8.3347,2.1296,5.6235,8.4082,0.6853,6.3674,1.5651,4.0621,1.9329,4.4616,1.9495,6.0373,2.8153,1.7637,1.8518,4.3844,3.0586,6.0324,2.9932,1.134,3.3047,5.9161,3.8557,2.8242,0.1955,1.8341,0.5301,0.0875,3.0553,1.5293,6.4303,4.6544,4.6635,4.1265,3.6093,0.2994,1.2269,1.7288,2.7754,4.674,0.7944,1.3039,2.3732,4.7992,5.1112,5.3785,0.4882,0.9669,2.2239,2.8884,4.9449,2.8199,7.6156,2.9979,5.0132,0.6707,0.4641,0.8283,4.7616,1.4792,4.0416,6.8728,1.054,5.2302,1.6852,8.4271,0.5416,13.2796,1.9755,5.4529,2.7252,5.6955,6.2528,0.9553,1.8775,4.33,3.643,0.4411,0.2369,1.6016,1.073,1.2819,4.2368,6.0548,3.4599,4.6152,2.8698,4.2996,1.7974,2.939,6.911,2.7342,3.6266,0.8717,5.2223,8.7922,6.3884,11.9698,1.6514,7.9365,3.7689,1.0132,0.5032,0.4792,3.7666,1.6757,4.4535,0.3135,0.0736,2.0303,0.5483,1.0534,0.1238,4.5422,1.6201,2.5598,5.1738,2.67,3.2198,2.8282,3.1771,8.1662,1.9165,2.802,4.806,4.6248,0.5361,3.3579,0.5601,0.196,2.8774,2.8234,3.9574,2.5636,1.2638,3.8187,1.0496,2.7596,4.2437,1.0836,3.4454,5.2268,0.2568,0.453,2.7084,0.5709,0.0391,2.2427,4.8396,1.4687,3.4362,2.126,1.7971,2.7473,2.3708,1.6996,3.2007,2.4124,2.5695,4.6745,3.75,3.3186,0.0514,8.1945,2.5903,1.5569,3.7725,0.9079,1.833,6.9875,8.0974,3.2157,4.1077,3.3493,2.9195,1.85,1.8142,0.6148,2.331,1.6433,4.8019,0.0069,0.6604,1.3484,3.0854,2.1494,5.7147,2.9047,0.865,3.306,1.3933,3.07,0.195,1.8828,2.9552,2.3749,3.8061,0.28,0.8907,0.8703,2.3018,3.203,0.7185,2.536,2.8648,3.899,3.8441,0.718,5.0432,5.5298,3.0705,7.74,0.923,0.0682,2.3835,8.2966,2.5944,0.2727,1.1032,0.4084,0.296,0.5858,1.869,2.7745,2.4469,0.0559,4.2543,2.2444,2.9637,5.01,0.9107,4.0292,0.5594,2.6666,5.7688,3.0761,5.9607,1.4689,3.9231,4.9439,2.4349,4.1056,1.5445,1.8455,8.5666,3.122,3.3561,4.5203,3.9256,1.4043,3.7489,0.2893,2.5331,6.6434,7.0307,2.7867,3.6287,6.4021,7.2666,2.1979,3.9541,2.6738,2.3637,0.8419,4.7597,4.1048,3.8861,0.0172,2.7361,0.3205,5.5221,5.9104,3.9689,1.6329,3.9558,0.8768,7.1987,1.2043,2.8787,6.1337,0.9679,3.9359,2.9957,1.4208,4.2229,0.4737,1.0012,2.2422,0.2187,5.8085,0.0174,4.1309,1.1047,4.1006,2.4555,6.4213,1.1373,3.2699,3.13,4.7393,5.7319,8.3409,0.9318,5.8297,1.6747,3.0807,1.0833,7.8169,1.0643,0.9488,4.5138,4.0435,0.7804,1.7649,4.5452,0.1138,2.9636,3.4809,5.18,1.3791,1.7904,2.345,0.7218,1.5057,0.54,1.2144,1.1362,0.2373,3.7628,0.1897,9.0121,1.3707,0.6342,2.3858,7.2808,1.9378,1.4998,4.9665,3.6283,1.9055,4.8215,2.3745,5.3517,3.82,0.3651,2.8613,1.7501,4.9046,0.7758,2.7967,4.9323,3.5889,0.4084,0.9842,1.6506,0.4753,6.1846,0.9492,3.1385,1.0436,2.4143,3.9729,3.6713,2.5825,4.8171,5.4294,0.1089,3.5865,2.217,4.8533,0.0366,4.8167,5.7852,1.304,2.5519,3.6044,4.0263,1.5505,3.2021,0.5622,5.0827,1.8134,3.4177,7.0948,0.0508,2.6386,0.7194,1.9857,7.9323,0.9807,1.9014,1.1747,2.0826,5.22,1.6469,0.0114,2.8775,4.6852,0.5062,3.273,1.8974,1.6961,3.2988,1.1327,5.3606,0.0159,6.4927,0.3478,0.69,2.3642,2.2208,4.868,6.1924,1.0518,2.309,3.1493,2.0535,0.4595,0.0048,3.226,3.2313,0.2391,1.7412,0.6941,5.7412,0.5373,3.522,1.6154,4.4418,1.9527,3.359,1.5803,7.808,6.8494,0.7533,6.8503,2.632,9.7945,0.583,4.1442,2.3849,0.7628,2.7917,0.8731,3.4127,3.174,4.2336,5.0254,3.3475,1.3165,0.4227,0.0003,3.4202,0.792,2.4397,0.7745,2.2969,6.2521,4.4432,1.5281,1.1837,2.8007,1.5709,4.95,0.1915,7.3756,5.9739,3.6185,5.1039,1.0236,1.522,0.3713,4.5499,1.5309,3.1533,0.9711,1.0396,0.0294,6.4905,3.1074,1.1572,3.8058,0.2442,0.5665,3.3556,0.7688,3.9138,1.7445,1.1855,0.3184]}

The game is not meant for people who are physically unable to take on the game. A simple click on the \u2018Yes\u2019 button in one of the boxes provides you with the necessary information about the game and then you can start the game. Your current game will always continue, even if you hit \u2018Yes\u2019. A similar button will allow you to turn off the game. You can also open a window by right-clicking the menu bar and choosing \u2018Exits...\u2019. You will be asked to choose to exit the game, stop saving your game or load your save file. Depending on the button you choose you will be taken to the new screen or the saved screen of the previous game.\n- Enemy levels are adjusted to your level, so you don\u2019t have to learn new skills and you will always keep the same difficulties.\n- To learn new skills, you will have to improve your stats or spend gems. Gems can be found in the cash box in the bottom left. For every 20 gems you collect, you get one skill. You will earn gems by defeating enemies or just by playing the game. Once you have sufficient gems, simply collect them by clicking on the cash box in the bottom left and then clicking on the \u2018Collect Items\u2019 button. To use a skill, tap and hold a skill. To equip a weapon, tap and hold a slot for the weapon to appear. When equipped, click on it when you want to use your weapon. After hitting \u2018Ok\u2019 or \u2018Continue\u2019 you will see the amount of damage you have dealt to your target. The damage you have done will be shown as well as the damage that the enemy has done to you. You will get an indication of your experience point ( EXP ) needed to advance to the next level.

{"prompt":"You are the head of the IT department for the lair of a multi-billionaire super villain .","text":"You are the head of the IT department for the lair of a multi-billionaire super villain. You have only just started to get to know your fellow bosses. If you are hired to be the leader of the IT department, find out what types of decisions you can make and what type of information you need to know about the business. How much does a successful IT manager make? How can you go about getting the job? Are there additional skills you need to do well as the head of the IT department?\nAn IT manager is in charge of ensuring that an organization can operate based on information technology. Many roles can perform information technology in an organization, but the manager needs to have a bachelor\u2019s degree or beyond in the field. The average annual salary is about $140,000, depending on the location of the employer.\nYou need to have strong communication skills especially in a team environment. IT Managers usually manage multiple projects, and they need to make sure that all employees are on the same page. IT managers need strong organizational skills to find the resources necessary to manage IT projects. Communication skills with IT departments are also essential to an IT manager. You need to be able to communicate with the business leaders or IT teams to get necessary resources. You also need to know how to communicate with employees, including how to provide training and employee benefits or even explain how it will affect them.\nIT managers deal with technical challenges all the time, so they need to follow current trends and technological changes related to an organization. Understanding how to use information technology also helps an IT manager make decisions. The IT Manager\u2019s first duty is to create an organization\u2019s IT strategy. This strategy defines how information technology is used by the company, including how the data can be organized and used to support the business.\nIf you have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a masters degree in a related field, such as information technology, it is recommended that you pursue a master\u2019s program.\nA Master\u2019s degree is usually offered in business management, which is also an advanced degree in business that is usually required by IT employers.

Elizabeth is a member of the United Nations Inter-agency Coordination Centre for the Prevention of Genetic Engineering ; however, her cyborgs body is defective and she has a weak connection to her own life-signs. The player's mission is to help her in overcoming the obstacles of being a cyborg.\nThe game begins with a prologue ( and not too long ). After this one, the game begins in the main city of Earth, which houses a United Nations Inter-agency Coordination Centre for the Prevention of Genetic Engineering. A message in Morse is heard on intercom in the lobby and a security guard introduces the player to Director Richard. When Elizabeth says that one of his people has been killed, Director Richard asks why they did not alert him. Director Richard later asks why Elizabeth was brought back from the grave to live on Earth and he tells her they have discovered an ancient civilisation on an alien star, which is rich in resources. He tells her that she has until midnight to return to Earth. Elizabeth has just a few hours to prepare herself and then head to the nearest rocket ship for a trip home.\nThe story progresses in a flashback style. The player travels back in time to the late 19th century. A scientist has invented an invention that can send signals through space and time : the telegraph. The scientist is Professor Thomas Edison, who has invented the telephone by accident. One can use the telephone to communicate with people across the world in real time. The inventor is shocked to hear the message from Secretary of the General Inter-agency Council, Richard, telling him that the first alien ship that landed is not an explorer but a biological weapon. Edison then realizes that the message is from an alien ship that landed on Earth in the distant future. It looks like this ship has crashed and may even be extinct. Edison tells the Secretary that he plans to build a telegraph so that signals can be transmitted through space and through time. The telegraph will be able to travel through infinity, which means that it will be possible to send signals even in the distant future. The telegraph would be connected to the main computer and when two messages are being sent, the main computer would read them and transmit them to all other telegraphs around the world.","token_len":533,"entropy":[2.6222,8.2167,0.5904,0.1687,1.9199,4.4241,0.3713,2.5835,9.6838,4.48,5.1231,3.1785,6.8402,3.0497,0.0663,1.5926,0.7139,7.8058,0.1276,4.1279,5.7055,1.5364,7.2972,4.5772,3.2914,5.0842,3.6677,2.0179,0.7937,6.3483,9.1491,1.5308,4.8169,10.3241,4.1951,0.0246,8.8223,2.7557,0.6834,3.6065,2.5961,2.513,0.2818,9.3392,1.6149,8.1377,5.6632,0.3493,0.8974,2.6929,0.4929,1.6857,5.4032,2.0871,4.5568,0.0527,1.3424,3.34,3.0952,0.7853,5.0498,1.6323,2.1468,6.2229,0.9724,4.398,5.3478,4.9757,0.001,3.0275,1.9125,4.8059,0.2028,4.8134,5.3077,1.0662,1.7485,1.2487,2.1956,3.4029,0.0077,0.5,4.8617,0.9701,5.2705,1.557,6.0755,3.1532,0.5378,3.3178,0.8265,1.8767,4.2162,0.2464,4.881,1.3807,9.8309,3.8628,0.0844,2.1384,5.5272,0.009,3.7356,11.7596,1.1058,7.4504,0.8736,1.7215,2.0234,1.8115,6.3117,4.0828,0.3549,1.8883,2.3441,3.183,4.2937,6.0567,3.6035,0.537,2.4033,1.1431,3.3698,3.5116,0.4229,0.0552,3.1257,0.9323,3.9484,5.6813,1.6521,3.8475,2.7467,4.7998,1.1873,0.3317,0.0003,1.5035,0.9232,1.6638,1.5909,3.6874,0.6618,1.4348,5.4934,0.0,4.8668,7.6933,6.4251,5.4953,0.7931,7.8405,3.2821,2.8354,6.1068,0.7368,0.687,1.8032,2.3129,3.5507,1.7434,3.5576,3.239,0.8928,4.6247,1.4564,2.8833,5.8066,1.7069,7.5444,0.0157,1.7596,0.084,0.0531,0.1352,0.0562,0.0926,1.0217,0.0756,0.1057,0.005,0.0555,0.0042,1.1575,4.2913,5.6108,4.5057,8.5922,5.3428,3.5916,3.521,7.2582,1.5398,4.2166,0.6701,5.1105,3.4298,2.526,5.8412,1.3695,5.867,1.789,0.5777,0.4408,7.924,5.4923,6.8331,4.2182,5.1037,4.2251,1.2001,6.5282,0.3057,3.0928,5.0402,1.5896,1.5177,1.8681,0.6545,4.1729,0.0665,3.2631,3.8384,3.311,4.4486,0.8553,5.8914,2.8657,1.6942,3.6466,0.0123,6.6594,3.0439,3.2194,2.2612,2.6749,4.835,1.9532,3.122,0.7604,3.8342,3.5265,5.0649,2.6194,0.7853,3.1697,2.7974,2.2987,0.7373,4.5048,2.289,5.3683,2.757,2.7816,4.2243,2.9286,4.4663,1.4255,7.5624,3.0862,2.1359,1.491,7.2778,0.5,1.8817,0.7127,3.3485,2.3092,0.9271,0.7104,2.5819,2.0416,8.8128,5.1628,1.0837,3.4549,0.4023,0.6097,1.6127,2.7248,3.9546,5.3316,5.4409,0.6122,1.1546,1.0537,4.7929,1.628,1.6828,3.8507,5.429,1.0845,0.6373,4.1801,9.1226,2.1866,3.58,1.7046,4.1898,2.825,0.3864,0.9435,1.5641,3.9174,3.4137,2.326,1.6233,5.8324,6.8572,1.6641,1.5303,1.1427,3.905,2.2862,0.5891,0.005,0.8068,1.0077,4.3413,1.6523,0.0067,0.1699,2.5653,3.4515,3.265,4.0744,5.2183,2.3444,5.1336,1.2146,2.2494,4.5142,4.552,3.0613,1.2569,1.7127,1.5768,9.751,1.2776,7.2839,0.1299,0.4899,1.2192,2.7475,2.6288,5.151,4.0061,3.4453,1.1314,1.4194,1.959,4.5676,0.8159,3.8956,4.8062,2.5207,0.5633,5.2879,6.4726,3.4108,1.0696,3.2928,0.6554,0.9409,0.648,3.0998,4.6206,1.0561,1.7157,3.97,2.1932,0.1922,0.6864,1.396,4.3736,2.2802,8.3063,1.4668,2.8638,1.695,3.35,2.0759,9.0911,0.7058,2.4387,5.5285,10.8862,0.2394,0.2097,5.8845,2.0408,5.0879,2.4959,3.8055,0.4617,0.5147,1.5887,5.7955,6.6599,4.5616,2.6556,3.2871,5.1159,4.0204,3.4515,6.9352,1.8718,0.5494,6.4534,3.3999,1.015,3.0521,3.3942,4.9662,0.3328,1.1833,3.2405,1.0952,1.9143,2.1339,1.0874,1.6678,2.3195,2.8663,0.6276,0.3026,3.4842,1.0336,3.2966,0.3729,0.5079,4.3073,5.6743,0.343,3.5132,2.6771,2.1861,3.8102,1.9134,6.28,4.9655,0.7188,5.5632,0.397,2.7021,2.9957,0.7372,6.0392,1.6219,1.2005,4.738,0.195,4.5719,0.5233,5.4014,0.0071,4.5598,0.3609,9.4834,0.7653,0.7247,2.9051,2.2859,0.3316,0.2583,7.6907,0.2407,0.4039,1.3733,1.3697,0.001,2.6281,1.4603,2.2905,0.0045,3.5538,1.6625,8.9509,1.829,2.9395,2.5179,0.6423,1.7999,0.9196,1.0419,2.8462,0.2392,1.7192,2.3757,4.868,2.2622,1.0781,1.3554,0.2019,0.2505,1.7219,1.3702,0.0007,5.0092,1.336,4.8911,0.1742,1.1102,5.1564,3.1686,2.4333,7.2592,7.0371,2.3802,0.7285,5.5493,0.5089,1.08,1.1889,3.2778,0.2603,2.1219,4.0794,1.0706,1.5129,3.6558,0.5313,1.43,4.4391,2.8236,6.8229,0.0658,0.9097,3.866,0.1248,0.2882,0.2418]}
{"prompt":"There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes .","text":"There is no prompt. Just write a story you've always been thinking about or one you've been thinking about sharing. Anything goes. Read some of what you have done before if you want to be sure you've not written something completely bizarre and unintentionally funny.\nThe event will take place on Friday, October 21 in the school hall and we are looking forward to seeing a few of your ideas come together.\nThis will be followed by a potluck and we will take our time looking at the stories we have received and discussing which ones we will publish on the site.\nI have a very important and personal request. Would you please send me a link to the story you wrote before September 2? I 'll have to get used to reading fiction and seeing pictures rather than reading history. I don't know what to do with the rest of this year's submissions since they are in a pile in my basement. I really haven't found time to read them.\nThanks so much for all the submissions last year. I'm anxious to see what you all created this year with your writing.\nAll students will have the opportunity to complete a form and have their story read. Please email your story to me at before Friday, October 23. I 'll be reading stories by the end of the school day. The stories will be published and displayed at school the fall after school year ends. Please be willing to share with us some of your ideas on what makes funny and funny. What we like and don't like.\nIf you have questions or concerns about the process, please email me directly at\nI've been a part of a very fun collaborative venture here at the school. We've been working with a group of middle school students and learning about the life of Oscar Wilde. The students have been studying his writing and are now producing our own work.\nRecently, we decided to ask students to write about what life was like for Oscar Wilde when his father died. Of course, this was difficult because we all knew how he reacted to loss.\nI wrote my own essay on the topic of Oscar Wilde and the death of his father. As it turned out, I thought my story was funny and it made me think about life and the loss of a father. I've decided to share with my fellow teachers and parents.\nThe theme of the story was that my father was one of the most wonderful men I know and I can never forgive him for leaving me behind so many years.\nI 'll share with you the story. Please email it to me or bring it into school so I can read it to my fellow teachers and parents.","token_len":534,"entropy":[2.8744,1.2771,9.919,3.9458,5.3486,6.1995,2.0658,8.032,4.7994,3.5491,4.4688,2.7818,5.2829,0.3561,3.6857,5.0491,0.853,1.2259,1.5914,2.099,0.0613,7.6244,0.8602,7.0194,5.211,0.717,5.5369,5.0148,1.7617,4.1168,0.7033,2.7907,4.9408,3.6154,6.7912,0.3489,2.2627,0.4226,3.0375,2.0324,1.2343,1.7479,5.1108,4.4646,1.8681,4.2427,7.006,2.9453,8.8185,2.8842,0.4073,1.3006,8.0182,8.1133,2.893,2.2546,0.0072,1.5488,2.9503,0.2776,2.2805,3.5255,4.6954,1.3994,7.2686,4.7251,3.5527,4.8614,2.7012,2.5452,0.0888,0.0049,0.91,5.2212,2.0573,0.9301,3.3028,4.2339,2.773,1.2383,0.8053,1.2046,4.1273,3.38,0.2539,5.451,0.2296,0.6535,9.2299,0.0174,2.2769,3.5416,0.9726,4.397,3.0073,0.8047,5.7711,1.2367,1.729,5.0686,2.2923,1.6065,5.2799,1.5656,4.5112,4.8635,0.5316,1.7207,3.602,5.1327,3.7306,1.6636,2.5494,0.3852,1.0793,4.1245,2.8049,2.3805,3.701,4.5795,3.542,3.7175,5.5742,1.6586,4.8583,0.1612,2.3941,3.0677,0.5858,1.1535,2.594,0.1519,1.9852,2.3581,1.0067,3.4758,3.4494,6.4227,4.9545,2.2002,2.1584,10.3374,2.5102,3.8284,0.7346,3.8866,5.3301,0.0055,4.2636,7.3526,2.0506,5.4035,4.7267,6.2728,0.0585,3.0254,6.39,0.8146,1.9328,3.0015,0.0012,2.0851,1.8635,2.4064,1.1036,0.6213,2.2932,3.9914,0.0919,2.662,2.8068,2.164,4.9591,5.7351,3.7596,1.0837,4.5528,2.7651,7.4798,3.3621,0.8368,3.2572,0.7897,1.6636,4.206,5.9539,0.001,4.0361,3.8252,0.3051,1.9946,2.3179,1.8476,1.4939,3.5479,3.0605,0.0122,0.6379,3.3362,1.5913,3.2101,7.8401,0.2645,0.8986,1.2484,2.7316,7.2918,0.2264,1.1624,0.9177,1.6112,3.2664,7.7438,2.1101,0.028,4.853,0.6996,3.8636,0.79,1.3885,5.784,7.9671,2.9735,2.2758,1.6302,0.7791,0.0424,6.1144,1.863,4.9759,2.3048,3.7072,1.2073,2.3147,3.2293,1.5977,3.3322,3.9378,2.5076,0.9504,0.6399,2.4538,0.9763,9.9929,8.0465,0.7914,0.1936,5.5823,1.9562,1.8119,6.0671,0.2153,1.5862,5.5746,7.1772,4.0386,2.4667,1.7434,0.0265,0.6955,3.1471,1.5749,0.9566,4.1408,5.4486,0.8777,0.4423,2.5106,3.2888,6.0184,1.7588,4.3621,5.615,9.043,4.448,1.6366,4.9811,4.4745,0.2254,3.2171,3.0855,7.1746,0.0252,2.1773,2.604,2.3371,4.0353,0.4697,0.3902,2.2509,4.1466,2.0168,5.1852,9.1041,1.6614,2.6201,1.5968,5.303,4.9543,4.4636,2.0101,2.0706,0.0034,0.2889,2.2715,1.4948,2.9627,0.2201,1.4113,3.4158,1.3499,2.1758,1.1991,1.8156,4.6141,1.1248,0.8299,1.921,0.4057,4.2998,0.9076,4.1666,3.1403,3.7049,1.8035,3.1277,4.4791,0.0217,2.0699,3.0,4.0411,9.0959,5.7004,4.3898,0.2689,2.4943,3.0567,0.7916,2.1948,2.275,1.4687,2.3911,2.3007,1.907,2.2106,0.0809,7.5635,0.255,1.2712,2.1341,5.9152,2.6926,1.8755,5.0131,0.678,8.9969,0.4828,1.129,2.8077,2.9857,1.6363,1.2724,6.4536,4.1794,3.3825,1.3718,3.7034,3.85,6.632,5.2898,1.2417,3.4872,0.7746,2.5132,6.3156,1.0938,1.355,4.2522,0.188,5.3825,4.2687,0.819,2.3394,2.291,3.3659,5.5517,1.2478,0.004,1.0881,2.2724,0.0748,3.5708,4.3824,5.1609,0.6555,0.7304,5.8336,0.2226,0.4305,2.5564,1.7371,6.1946,1.8936,2.1702,3.2645,1.8643,3.4399,3.7002,6.1034,0.4821,5.8589,1.0814,3.4052,2.4651,4.6497,3.8486,2.1688,4.551,2.1259,1.597,2.2131,2.5579,2.2008,0.1219,1.9731,2.6996,4.2157,0.0883,0.5909,0.2408,0.9633,4.2295,3.3107,1.3217,0.0005,0.0903,2.1262,4.2841,3.8226,3.8274,1.2861,2.4687,0.9261,3.7887,3.2124,1.1998,2.3791,0.5325,4.0784,1.9882,2.1701,4.6086,0.2298,1.8135,2.7455,0.4435,1.5298,3.8849,4.2296,0.3065,2.1721,2.5046,4.4159,3.9212,4.4902,1.2684,3.4169,3.1464,1.2616,2.9767,6.7552,0.4601,1.0486,1.6428,2.1459,1.944,5.6657,0.618,1.4317,4.5542,0.0559,0.3669,1.0927,4.5241,1.9071,1.129,2.4322,1.5901,1.8444,4.6083,3.5824,4.8261,0.3477,0.8526,5.235,1.8112,2.959,4.2194,2.7745,0.4377,3.5745,2.3912,1.6084,5.9589,0.8782,3.376,1.2582,0.9076,2.0492,1.1791,6.2159,3.6867,3.1623,2.5896,0.1964,0.2313,3.9671,6.6589,0.6197,4.6106,6.6455,3.5925,0.9496,0.0934,2.5761,0.2659,2.5844,1.132,3.6703,1.5784,0.7725,1.0489,0.2705]}

The team must travel to both worlds to discover just how much of the identity and actions of Batman are determined by our own decisions, in addition to his or's inherited. The first game we played in this series allowed us to take on the identity of the caped crusader as our own. However, as the second game progressed the focus of the narrative shifted from our personal storytelling, as the plot now moved inexorably towards our own destiny. In other words, the second game is the game where Batman was no longer a game, but a new way of life. It may give you false hope that is it possible to make a switch in the Multiverse, but there is no chance for that.\nThe Multiverse Theory is not the only possible way that a multiverse works. We could also have the same universe containing many alternative realities. In one of these realities, we are not Batman and as a result you play as Batman.\nOne example of an alternative universe that involves the world of comics could be a universe where you are Superman. In this universe, you are on a mission to stop Superman from destroying Gotham ( one of many possible missions ). However, when the mission is interrupted, the villains take over and you are forced to stop the villains, but you become Superman instead. It's a kind of reversal.\nAnother example of a reversal universe could be another version of Batman where he died while fighting Zod. In this alternate reality, the same Batman, but from a point in time when he is still alive, returns to Gotham and destroys the villains. In this example, he defeats Zod but also dies while doing so. If the game involves the same universe, he becomes Superman to defeat Zod. The only alternative could be the universe in which we are the same as the last game.\nAnother alternative universe could be the one in which he does not die and his mission against supervillains is successful. He becomes Superman to protect the world and becomes Batman to defeat the supervillains. This is one of the more likely possibilities but again the game must be played from the same universe.\nThe Multiverse Theory makes a lot of promises. All of the games in our series have been in the same universe in which we are superheroes. The world is very different and the morality of the individuals is not the same as in the games. However, for those who like a challenge, there are many different possible stories to follow.","token_len":534,"entropy":[1.9909,1.5,9.4533,5.7416,4.4276,0.6796,2.7478,1.0223,1.3317,4.7268,1.8351,4.9112,2.1597,10.7757,1.916,3.8852,0.0566,2.0291,0.4841,1.5119,0.3321,0.7637,0.1581,5.9156,6.598,2.6075,0.5564,0.7105,0.3453,5.3167,2.6386,8.9377,0.1047,1.7921,1.2494,0.2746,0.1811,3.5718,6.9863,3.2417,4.0132,1.279,6.4436,2.0498,1.4529,3.9333,5.7838,1.0692,2.1645,2.2352,1.5596,6.6897,2.9169,5.3284,0.2942,1.3334,1.1122,4.587,0.116,5.9577,2.4875,4.8223,2.4932,5.1545,3.4268,0.0021,4.2259,4.5406,11.5481,7.8238,4.2482,2.7039,4.9592,4.921,4.6078,1.859,2.5811,2.1555,3.8434,6.6914,0.5968,0.1009,3.6216,1.8463,1.1088,4.007,0.444,1.7845,7.6335,0.0254,0.0257,0.024,3.5751,3.9313,1.8216,1.1988,4.0644,0.0372,3.3584,1.8407,5.1249,0.1357,3.0486,3.4871,5.7154,1.7897,0.5723,4.817,0.5793,1.8646,3.1288,4.3366,8.5194,3.0333,3.3989,2.2789,5.0641,6.486,3.6002,8.6457,0.0096,0.0002,1.772,2.4679,1.8294,5.1146,0.4914,3.1471,3.8538,0.051,0.082,1.5604,4.476,0.1107,2.7083,3.3119,3.4118,1.6425,1.9671,4.2435,5.0509,0.0279,2.0043,7.0288,2.2744,0.7571,1.0557,6.1679,5.3331,0.5265,2.2388,0.6679,3.1328,5.3781,6.8611,0.9291,10.1682,0.1866,1.6605,7.1676,6.9449,4.5242,0.5659,3.7508,1.8788,7.7673,2.3381,1.9518,8.0984,0.0003,1.4015,0.4682,3.7783,0.5748,1.2313,4.4878,3.075,1.7258,1.1672,1.5838,5.9723,3.9343,0.0037,0.3699,1.6566,3.0058,2.4002,0.6214,6.6819,1.782,3.8574,3.2592,5.0797,0.0421,5.7414,0.4686,3.7507,2.923,2.6852,3.3878,2.534,2.818,2.9102,7.2067,4.0124,8.0197,2.5648,1.415,2.5298,4.3495,2.0627,2.4068,3.7023,0.4411,2.2074,2.7173,3.6098,3.1394,2.2834,5.4327,2.0889,0.5917,3.8327,5.1907,0.59,1.1795,0.6168,3.4115,4.0504,4.8464,0.4833,3.3196,1.7414,1.677,2.7009,4.9977,2.6394,3.9766,0.6443,5.6791,3.1136,0.2567,2.5903,2.7501,0.731,2.4955,1.2498,2.2437,0.8777,2.0303,0.925,1.3283,0.4666,1.1503,1.0232,6.5475,1.3562,2.4342,0.3065,2.6836,3.2208,0.9645,1.4767,4.5996,5.7947,12.6871,0.2714,4.3334,4.1219,5.6685,2.8793,2.5145,0.0197,3.9685,2.065,2.6682,0.9563,4.8579,1.0431,2.1811,4.9256,4.0142,1.0294,1.6046,3.0749,1.3665,2.5113,0.1497,4.8096,1.9562,3.215,3.3874,3.1596,1.7719,6.1634,2.2286,2.9774,0.2445,3.9489,1.5424,1.4265,5.6769,0.0011,6.7721,2.9413,1.7731,2.9753,1.3589,0.493,1.4419,8.3643,4.6694,1.6529,0.0768,4.3061,4.1961,0.132,2.0257,3.7899,3.0241,7.4932,3.9817,2.8172,6.8158,1.5644,0.9571,1.3663,0.2519,2.656,1.2831,0.346,2.5044,5.312,2.9833,4.0327,2.4608,4.476,1.2251,7.6786,3.1634,1.5479,3.6491,1.0796,2.414,2.7364,1.7779,0.256,5.6571,0.2897,2.246,1.4234,4.667,0.8913,3.5912,0.7031,2.2404,0.3858,4.8891,0.3164,2.7003,6.738,2.6185,0.0128,3.3481,3.9989,4.4071,3.2353,3.696,0.3598,0.3262,4.3832,2.3836,3.9836,6.5531,2.066,2.1842,2.0505,0.9155,4.4253,3.967,1.3584,5.585,4.2593,1.6958,0.0031,0.8691,3.3678,3.5723,5.6125,5.5083,0.103,2.4819,2.9042,2.6359,0.0696,3.3492,1.6174,3.7277,2.5212,1.9673,1.8223,5.1682,1.5581,0.8063,0.8854,2.9756,3.3789,0.4671,1.7253,0.5445,1.8064,2.1603,1.7612,0.0148,5.5633,4.7907,0.3364,0.6626,2.5088,4.529,4.9339,6.3722,7.5129,0.0013,0.838,1.0412,3.4603,0.2796,4.7516,3.5456,1.7184,1.2379,3.8636,1.4262,1.2388,2.2344,5.453,1.8003,0.9421,2.5796,1.0399,1.0384,0.0029,0.1429,0.2126,2.1728,1.8309,3.599,0.6582,0.2175,3.1623,4.26,2.6949,5.5415,5.3762,3.2259,1.5834,5.5986,1.4613,1.6524,3.4508,1.3249,3.8786,2.6876,0.6785,0.627,2.3338,1.8496,0.0022,0.1068,4.6629,2.2958,1.5912,0.0245,5.0617,1.7632,5.9162,0.9081,0.9989,2.9545,1.6773,4.1684,1.2626,1.2554,2.1862,4.6035,1.6759,3.0912,0.6305,4.1099,2.0264,1.3415,1.1715,5.7155,0.5418,2.4224,4.2959,2.5869,3.8971,0.5636,2.6287,2.2652,8.8572,0.6364,0.9203,7.7983,1.8894,3.4573,1.8245,0.042,1.8986,2.1164,0.6482,3.7922,0.6363,2.285,0.0396,4.6131,3.4364,0.902,3.5076,3.4896,4.6815,0.9902,2.2067,0.7577,1.5967,3.0013,4.1249,4.6304,1.9432,3.0752,0.4801]}
{"prompt":"She was almost beautiful .","text":"She was almost beautiful. Her dresses were full of laffing and labrum. Her hips were perfect in size and shape. She had smooth skin and a very beautiful face (I think that they said it was very round but I always saw it as oval) I was very fond of her and I always liked her.\nShe looked like an angel in a human dress. The way she moved, her smile when she talked to you, and also her voice when she sang were an unreal dream. So beautiful. And she knew how to act, just like the stars we have on TV.\nShe had so much talent and I wanted to help her. But that didn\u2019t happen, because she didn\u2019t need it and no one in her family wanted anything from me. Because she was a lot like your mother, a bit arrogant, a bit angry, a bit of a bad girl.\nShe loved her family very much and always tried for them. But when this family had no money, she had to help them, even though she was a famous singer. She really liked her son more than everything else in the world, and the only reason she started to fight to have him was because he wanted to be an actor, when he wanted be an engineer. She made him a very important job, but she was disappointed by his choice. He didn\u2019t really like acting. I don\u2019t know why.\nWhen he was in Spain I had seen him a few times in Madrid. I remember in his films, \u2018The girl who wrote on the sand \u201d and \u201cIn love and war, \u201d he took on a character that was rather silly and a bit of a loser (so I always called him), but he was good.\nHe liked to play very dangerous roles, such as \u2018The killer,\u2019 a role by William Peter Blatty, and he was good as it came.\nThey all said she didn\u2019t have many people who wanted to work with her, because she was too expensive, but the only one who really wanted to was her son, and she agreed, but never again to work with him.\nI was her friend for many years, though the only time I knew what he wanted to do was after the accident. He never told me. He had a small accident and he thought it would have to get rid of, but he didn\u2019t want, he wanted to stay alive. His mother always wanted him to die, but he was very stubborn and told his mother \u2018 I would like to live longer. \u201c","token_len":534,"entropy":[3.6758,6.302,7.7591,1.5502,3.0157,7.724,0.4029,4.963,0.3294,5.8872,7.8532,5.2355,1.9937,8.972,3.421,1.8082,1.4831,5.8129,0.3463,4.9962,3.9345,5.5814,1.4753,2.4681,0.555,1.3629,1.8374,5.7438,2.3401,0.8707,1.8113,3.6244,4.2296,1.8218,6.9158,3.4387,2.4496,3.0405,6.0718,4.3453,2.0219,0.5575,4.6447,6.3138,2.9148,1.2335,6.4106,4.5613,1.5383,0.545,3.6492,3.2701,3.5056,2.4328,2.412,4.6245,0.0375,0.4653,2.3081,2.1523,2.9257,2.6206,0.9085,1.8043,2.4633,4.8449,3.4217,1.9921,3.0582,1.5084,2.5772,2.4012,6.6661,4.2377,0.6699,3.3942,4.0013,0.3774,3.5997,3.0074,1.7848,5.905,5.8864,0.4462,3.7406,2.5666,2.7347,0.8764,2.1526,5.5417,0.6241,3.869,2.757,0.6368,4.2546,3.05,6.489,7.5493,3.6043,0.5602,5.568,3.8618,1.0551,3.5886,1.8308,5.2187,1.5617,0.0806,4.7468,2.5909,4.3721,0.5041,2.9636,6.4139,6.2679,3.5463,4.2993,4.0241,0.555,1.1818,1.71,2.2411,3.9512,0.5825,3.946,1.6151,3.0933,4.1452,0.2222,4.066,0.2672,1.6348,2.9557,4.4853,3.0058,16.7411,7.5144,1.0528,1.0894,2.9477,1.6414,1.4105,2.1649,0.4172,0.1211,0.0121,5.7852,3.3315,3.6665,5.8425,0.1757,4.7825,1.6413,1.0591,2.267,4.5549,1.9099,0.716,0.3765,4.6887,1.4828,0.9895,2.2047,6.592,2.8835,6.7756,2.1208,1.5332,3.3051,5.1794,6.2656,1.0954,1.5555,0.8702,5.7347,0.7772,1.3201,0.406,4.1324,0.3421,4.532,1.871,0.8902,1.5215,2.0078,4.4536,2.9517,1.9344,3.8821,0.0914,1.3693,4.106,4.0151,6.3919,3.1568,0.7848,2.3559,2.9304,6.0673,4.2505,4.3458,3.7908,1.4168,0.8164,1.3972,2.8987,1.0441,4.0841,1.0421,2.7416,3.382,1.6319,0.8126,1.378,2.1446,7.0294,2.4637,0.887,1.8672,4.8305,3.6384,1.9661,6.4048,5.3047,0.314,6.0291,0.8907,2.4435,0.9209,2.0865,1.7876,1.7652,4.1049,2.3356,2.5785,0.6471,5.2943,1.9935,5.5821,4.2915,3.6119,1.9399,2.5692,0.3122,1.9036,3.2867,0.4222,1.6825,3.5724,2.8345,1.8863,6.1502,0.971,2.7126,7.7258,0.6412,8.1174,0.7212,2.3957,5.0153,1.2503,2.5988,3.6019,3.8489,6.1715,1.2779,1.8941,1.2718,1.9381,7.4482,3.6847,2.165,4.757,1.104,3.504,2.8313,0.2415,0.1648,0.0011,4.4894,2.0315,4.16,1.4702,3.4604,3.0537,0.0591,0.1099,0.0058,1.0701,1.344,1.195,1.1988,3.5144,2.0576,1.2045,2.6838,7.5633,3.5495,3.0417,5.1254,1.3756,4.6433,1.874,0.1307,2.9779,4.5914,1.187,1.8542,3.68,5.0194,2.1343,7.7469,1.5698,10.7029,6.7118,5.6857,6.9693,2.149,5.9314,5.7655,0.7749,7.35,6.165,7.0307,3.271,4.4156,4.0385,5.2053,7.1674,3.1064,4.7343,1.204,2.1693,2.9931,3.0194,5.704,4.6793,1.7827,3.6891,1.9638,1.1935,5.9751,5.8562,1.3643,3.4834,1.4297,2.7831,0.2362,4.5265,5.2426,5.2944,1.8355,4.7227,5.2346,0.4088,7.1886,1.5572,1.1875,1.22,4.3281,1.9948,1.5391,1.7317,3.7248,0.8655,1.6949,6.6179,5.7133,4.6886,1.346,4.1967,0.0054,5.1272,1.4041,1.7169,6.9419,2.5816,3.6594,2.9511,4.8922,4.1915,6.8869,6.1034,8.7633,5.4957,2.06,0.3231,1.6865,2.2676,1.2089,1.3568,3.3793,3.5144,4.5321,4.175,1.7799,1.4262,5.8322,3.8279,4.6355,4.535,4.491,0.1172,0.0738,0.006,2.3941,4.7591,3.3478,2.6215,3.4478,0.4285,2.5089,0.6889,0.0764,1.35,2.3355,0.6304,0.8364,2.799,4.9208,1.8204,2.1779,3.8183,2.9966,2.2144,0.5087,3.2743,0.6654,0.2362,6.2767,1.9997,1.8732,1.4451,2.0789,2.0303,6.2234,3.1058,2.4314,5.9636,5.9696,4.4774,0.9418,0.0985,0.5646,0.324,0.7678,2.1789,2.3688,6.2093,2.7775,2.7655,2.7734,0.0875,1.2812,6.3801,5.0747,3.3165,0.9161,0.7454,3.5266,4.9499,2.3803,1.2084,1.25,0.1381,0.3988,3.398,2.7233,4.6104,1.2345,1.9537,3.9716,2.7844,0.1612,2.7608,1.862,3.4839,2.038,5.3704,7.5313,2.0899,1.2395,4.6854,1.9016,1.3647,4.5007,2.7544,4.9532,4.0762,0.0527,5.0874,0.5989,1.253,1.7509,0.1615,0.0283,0.0054,1.8192,6.9825,2.9858,1.3615,0.4759,3.344,3.7664,0.7152,4.901,3.2108,3.159,2.8954,0.7091,0.2805,4.1026,1.0449,1.0915,1.3279,2.3582,2.7209,3.4491,1.2408,5.2563,4.0823,0.6838,7.0525,1.2868,5.8434,3.4852,4.0945,0.342,3.0576,6.0917,1.5593,5.1303,2.6842]}

{"prompt":"In the future , most of job interview questions are generally the same as modern-day ones , except when you get to the part where they ask , `` Are you willing to kill for your Corporation ? ''","text":"In the future, most of job interview questions are generally the same as modern-day ones, except when you get to the part where they ask, `` Are you willing to kill for your Corporation? '' then the person getting the question will often pause and shrug, as they find that statement difficult to deny. But it is here at this point that many people start playing games, either because they feel like making a big deal, or because they know they aren't going back to the interview. What they should do though, is tell the interviewer, you have been a very good employee for this Corporation, and I greatly appreciate your offer here, but you see, I don't think that company is right for me. The interviewer will either laugh, be shocked, or simply let you go. This is when you can cut the line and tell them exactly how you're thinking along these lines, without fear or apology. I believe this is the first place that you will find the most true measure of how well you'll perform as your job gets started.\nSo the most important thing for you to remember here, is that not only do you not have to worry or feel threatened about being asked this question, you SHOULD feel free to answer without fear. You might not actually kill anyone, but what will be the effect, will be, well, that will depend how smart you think you are. If you're smart you know there are plenty of alternatives of jobs out there, that would be better for you than working for the United Nations. Some of the jobs they could offer would be more interesting, have better working conditions, better pay, better benefits, better status, greater prestige, greater responsibility, greater opportunities, greater flexibility, and on and on and on. You should use your brain to find a job that fits your capabilities, rather than worry about being asked this question. The only other answer you could possibly give the interviewer is to tell them, well, the idea doesn't really interest me, but then I don't think I meet the requirements for being a good applicant. That is a better answer you could give, than saying you think that killing is a good idea.\nThe second thing you should remember is that the interview questions are the equivalent of the written tests for the police selection process. The written test will give you a pretty good indication if you're cut out for the job, so there really isn't much of a difference between being asked what your opinion is about this issue, and being asked anything else. The written tests are designed to measure the intelligence of the candidates, and they aren't really designed to measure your opinion of any issue.","token_len":535,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5009,0.2783,6.3233,1.4264,12.703,7.2658,3.4604,2.4048,7.5399,5.157,0.3785,1.4197,10.7684,4.2619,0.009,3.3222,1.3434,3.4866,4.7198,2.4406,4.4028,1.5565,1.1391,4.022,0.5678,2.8667,3.2555,3.35,8.7351,9.2245,0.0722,4.1109,0.0657,7.8326,3.9948,2.3899,12.8689,1.635,3.6704,7.3281,1.8113,3.48,6.0563,0.4728,0.9891,2.5178,4.5065,7.5756,1.1323,7.3825,1.7245,3.6618,3.8443,6.4607,2.1497,7.1731,3.4651,0.1755,7.3666,0.3224,3.3069,3.2303,1.5653,6.6506,4.8044,3.3695,0.3084,0.4541,4.0257,1.8392,3.5806,7.3522,4.0221,2.4111,5.5934,2.4978,0.3477,3.2538,2.1324,5.6075,1.1165,3.326,0.3355,4.0868,0.1508,0.297,0.2451,3.4537,1.6231,4.7152,0.0012,1.4892,7.9121,0.3706,1.4312,3.2078,1.5274,5.1193,2.1875,4.2447,1.4364,6.0488,1.2713,0.4951,4.8222,1.1515,0.1779,2.3687,5.9679,3.3727,3.2946,4.3346,3.4903,1.0459,3.9654,1.7403,4.9357,2.4889,1.7621,0.607,3.5086,8.379,0.2349,1.1027,4.6293,7.1241,1.9496,1.05,2.3405,6.9985,2.8452,1.3033,3.0257,0.002,2.045,2.2196,6.0954,1.5803,6.6516,1.1663,2.7012,1.1255,3.4804,4.7087,1.9766,5.2609,4.2278,2.048,5.8326,4.9549,0.5297,0.4152,3.7206,5.2675,1.4827,1.4482,0.4841,3.7776,0.7286,4.9918,1.2641,3.2609,7.323,2.0849,5.1336,1.7371,2.7082,1.3173,6.3171,2.4965,1.1091,4.3957,4.7831,8.3042,2.3845,0.0301,1.9439,4.5112,4.3612,2.7157,7.168,0.3357,2.949,3.8308,2.5255,0.6985,1.4201,3.6016,4.5705,1.9885,1.7969,2.7536,1.7537,2.6952,1.8846,6.1293,8.8157,0.0864,4.4732,2.0278,0.5692,6.0282,1.9719,2.2034,5.0189,3.2614,7.451,5.7134,0.2686,2.066,5.8561,3.6912,4.5001,0.4014,0.6344,2.8013,1.8623,0.5751,2.2892,2.8976,1.7494,1.154,0.4601,5.2908,1.4262,1.4546,0.2568,2.3913,1.348,0.1454,2.986,7.0535,3.0504,4.1954,2.075,2.2436,2.4256,3.1979,0.3958,0.3061,0.8862,7.62,3.1488,3.8171,0.0342,3.2306,5.2814,0.9449,1.7302,2.4743,3.6582,2.0887,4.8696,6.7696,4.2728,0.6534,0.5024,5.3262,4.5898,2.8456,1.3946,4.6055,3.7039,3.7207,1.1732,4.8999,4.9832,0.2807,3.4964,3.87,5.4977,5.5811,6.5278,0.6615,3.0775,0.4785,0.0929,0.8154,2.3921,0.2958,2.3227,3.1667,3.3992,3.8368,4.8714,1.1627,4.2175,0.0193,6.7435,6.5055,7.2658,2.8873,0.0035,0.9072,4.437,4.0848,0.7093,5.8353,3.2348,0.5048,1.4787,5.5864,1.2885,2.4718,4.8603,3.9142,0.9808,6.1269,1.6037,1.4687,2.8804,5.7012,4.0552,2.3609,2.6788,0.6783,3.1229,3.2601,1.1553,7.0272,2.0492,5.4096,0.1546,0.2225,3.2694,2.6029,0.2902,1.6193,1.7359,0.3717,1.8952,7.0324,0.6998,5.6947,4.8282,0.4717,2.981,5.5463,0.573,2.0505,3.9715,1.3337,2.1026,3.4316,0.5588,1.8,6.5526,0.1591,0.022,1.7691,0.0126,0.3995,3.0313,2.7166,5.5221,2.2693,4.6045,1.7635,2.9085,3.3276,0.6604,0.7348,2.897,0.6021,6.0526,0.9895,4.557,0.0127,4.6574,0.4095,2.6341,0.9178,1.4488,0.2093,0.5277,3.4771,2.7235,4.1987,6.2179,1.5614,3.4684,3.8358,1.2226,3.7043,0.3804,0.5221,2.1234,2.9221,0.2786,1.4753,4.2172,0.2693,3.8275,6.1241,5.7197,0.0003,2.4746,5.3533,2.7753,1.0846,1.1832,4.9692,3.2109,3.0964,0.001,1.6134,2.2416,10.1253,1.7077,2.845,1.1104,2.2174,0.8203,1.2363,6.4647,0.7851,3.7012,1.9644,2.7789,5.8445,1.8725,5.7138,1.2556,0.5306,2.5061,4.1323,3.0675,2.6235,4.4197,2.6084,6.8276,2.8915,1.7646,1.0825,0.543,0.6943,1.472,2.9071,3.1107,1.3541,1.2068,0.4588,2.0861,0.659,0.2095,2.6288,3.461,3.9182,1.2451,4.1777,5.3782,0.0476,2.1384,7.1526,5.0829,2.5214,2.6185,6.7905,11.1209,0.5791,0.5053,2.0356,3.0526,1.165,3.8898,2.9455,0.1777,1.1457,4.6725,0.4001,3.0985,4.5475,0.2951,1.6358,10.0098,1.7545,1.085,1.5259,0.7894,0.8932,3.5003,4.3682,4.8665,1.0269,0.0001,0.7296,2.9106,0.2872,0.9981,0.9829,3.752,3.082,4.7234,2.6845,5.8096,0.4755,2.175,2.9617,4.2506,0.8833,0.2189,1.0513,0.6532,5.9191,1.7049,0.4007,1.8973,2.1376,3.4236,1.4425,4.2019,0.296,4.8739,2.047,4.7829,0.4784,1.3332,3.2507,0.9293,1.3578,2.6883,4.5,0.0004,3.125,1.5422,0.2586,1.8305,2.3938,6.0636,1.6035,3.2294,4.4511,0.7517]}

What is it like like to be like a super hero with your face glowing red.?\nI wouldn\u2019t say all of the characters are as important as others; some come before others. I wouldn\u2019t say that the order that they are presented in is indicative of importance, either. I\u2019d suggest that it has more to do with how easy it is for me to identify with whom I\u2019m reading at any given point.\nAs for the order of the story, I\u2019d suggest that it may not be the most chronological from beginning to end, either. I wouldn\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019m really just saying what my own ideas have been.\nAlso, the characters aren\u2019t necessarily static from beginning to end - that\u2019s not quite what I\u2019m trying to say; they are, in many ways, more diverse than they seem to be in that way. They are constantly evolving as the story progresses.\nFinally, the concept of this story is not just that a galactic drug kingpin makes and sells dangerous and mind altering synthetic human emotion. It\u2019s that these substances are sold and made by humans, and humans are the ones using them. Humans are actually the ones who need them and who are actually affected by them in their personal lives.\nThis is a very good novel with a beautifully made opening scene and a simple yet very effective ending. I would just like to give more of a description of it.\nThe two main characters are both called \u201cJack\u201d and I think he\u2019s the more dominant of the two throughout the book. His appearance is also rather unique, as we see him very clearly here. It\u2019s only after we finish the book that we realise he\u2019s named \u201cJack\u201d, but the effect it has on the reader from the first few pages is enough to make it pretty clear.\nHe is also an almost perfect representation of humanity. He seems like the kind of person you would expect to be in this novel because of the world he lives in and the kind of experience he has had. He\u2019s not perfect, of course, but he is very well suited to the task he\u2019s put before him. He has the mental abilities to run his business very successfully, for one thing.","token_len":536,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,9.897,8.2989,4.216,0.1894,8.44,7.1329,0.5536,2.6603,8.8969,9.5305,6.492,6.5523,2.3159,1.1341,11.2222,3.3582,2.5331,5.933,11.0591,3.3047,4.657,1.2054,3.9534,4.4099,1.8791,4.2854,3.9413,4.4617,1.1128,2.1866,4.9884,1.947,3.7197,8.1245,2.329,2.1581,0.4145,5.7831,0.9504,1.7057,3.1981,7.2809,0.0038,0.6569,2.1316,4.1212,5.0758,2.4878,4.7095,2.3668,3.1326,0.9744,5.0254,2.6154,1.4102,2.2025,7.4734,0.6971,0.8047,5.556,2.8228,4.5036,3.6541,3.4027,2.7216,5.3859,6.5125,1.6736,8.3264,1.9579,8.8715,6.6435,15.1138,7.4439,0.6807,2.0828,6.3875,1.2967,2.4002,4.7782,0.9543,4.3162,4.8676,0.7157,5.1342,5.4861,3.3837,6.9311,5.7875,2.0889,0.9854,2.0995,3.569,0.6115,0.0363,0.0075,0.4073,1.9253,2.4183,7.8825,4.1904,1.9426,1.5465,4.1334,1.0092,0.9363,6.7609,0.0591,8.0741,1.9053,5.0961,0.4705,1.5742,6.143,0.0364,1.5546,6.4042,0.5213,2.8664,4.5047,3.102,0.6197,0.0138,0.0054,2.8406,7.049,0.3286,0.14,1.5402,4.4704,0.19,4.8647,0.7944,8.4022,0.8282,4.0632,0.4335,0.4553,6.2194,6.2786,3.9754,0.0981,3.7207,1.4129,2.1296,4.6842,1.5653,1.1745,6.557,1.1011,1.0359,3.4928,0.4658,0.9651,3.4988,0.135,0.7051,2.2097,0.3032,0.9697,4.0616,2.3465,0.674,2.4667,1.5396,9.1826,7.0066,2.0615,0.04,0.0636,1.0317,5.0934,0.2704,1.4983,3.239,0.0431,0.0304,0.0045,5.4729,2.1748,0.1879,2.6341,1.4468,3.9961,0.0363,2.2964,5.2312,2.7773,4.8121,2.9635,4.3307,3.858,5.1919,4.7514,0.7623,1.6536,1.3503,5.9042,0.2585,3.3165,3.6757,3.7318,0.738,0.6197,0.0118,3.5417,8.2245,5.7878,0.8625,0.0052,0.0309,5.7043,3.9121,4.4302,0.1261,0.6935,3.2281,4.9569,2.2111,0.4143,3.0447,0.0439,0.156,2.1001,0.0131,0.8738,4.5711,1.634,0.8396,4.1209,1.6689,4.3022,0.1853,0.0233,2.6101,6.082,1.126,2.9892,2.8607,1.9733,0.2524,2.2928,5.5552,4.7724,0.2555,2.9508,1.0506,5.1831,1.7263,3.2755,2.3982,0.6724,0.6482,0.8544,1.2457,6.1298,0.0396,2.3796,6.2112,0.1976,5.3524,2.6523,1.2445,2.6892,2.8187,3.6138,4.2961,5.0446,0.4646,0.1163,0.0042,2.9398,1.6635,0.0777,6.9044,2.6371,4.7929,0.1671,5.4318,2.7592,1.335,0.9923,0.6761,3.223,0.1079,0.2322,0.6097,4.2274,3.315,0.586,5.8938,2.8738,4.5999,1.9629,3.3079,2.1873,1.5428,4.6498,0.8402,2.5433,1.7279,4.4922,0.343,0.7683,4.6655,0.6262,5.7933,1.6015,1.4777,1.216,5.519,1.7832,3.3964,2.6337,1.357,4.8874,6.0636,0.1752,0.4472,4.2015,3.8284,4.2056,0.4791,0.3523,1.0327,2.8598,0.8748,1.9356,2.3313,4.0473,6.2727,4.114,1.0611,7.7478,4.8039,5.1299,3.1509,1.8151,1.3893,7.0435,3.7531,2.8354,3.6462,0.8595,0.2976,1.9997,2.1451,5.4453,0.6201,0.0422,3.4473,5.5853,2.8683,1.1738,4.7486,0.1639,3.74,1.5962,0.6117,2.093,6.6019,1.6092,0.6624,1.0559,4.7238,6.6137,8.028,4.9391,7.733,1.754,9.3154,1.1068,4.0327,3.0993,3.7332,1.5556,0.3203,0.5541,2.0252,4.7471,6.1371,3.1306,0.1309,0.3384,6.6544,0.3503,1.3695,0.2841,4.652,4.5661,1.0232,4.7039,4.0756,3.8585,1.605,1.5014,3.7587,1.1218,1.3136,5.4945,1.8476,5.7367,0.8601,3.6988,1.503,0.056,0.0106,4.8167,3.4937,2.341,4.3084,0.9855,1.4995,0.4094,0.5676,5.6814,2.0291,2.1054,0.0641,0.0245,7.2485,2.3449,0.143,0.5736,1.3546,0.1153,2.5833,2.4884,3.4037,6.5534,3.891,0.6124,0.3945,1.4171,2.3393,6.1365,1.6223,2.1824,2.8017,0.3961,0.546,5.9371,0.1081,1.1165,1.7284,5.4534,0.9131,1.7369,0.6469,3.3289,1.0875,2.4909,4.286,4.868,3.6053,4.4634,0.0284,4.5355,1.8021,1.2444,4.0359,3.0479,2.3633,2.2748,0.0461,1.0019,2.1807,0.7666,1.9198,0.6352,0.9878,2.1511,3.9497,3.6092,4.1918,1.0737,1.8207,6.2447,0.4428,2.0528,0.0875,2.6134,0.7454,4.2055,0.0157,6.0577,0.2683,1.0609,4.1578,1.1233,1.2338,2.4959,0.0447,0.0127,2.924,5.4375,0.7224,3.2145,0.0008,0.5135,0.2923,0.6554,1.1761,3.0539,3.4559,3.6865,0.5262,1.3351,4.5723,2.9159,6.0026,0.0273,0.0207,4.5009,4.2524,0.5202,0.3621,1.49,2.5109,2.4003,5.315,3.5277,1.2411,6.02,3.5099,3.9919,5.1344,3.8278,0.8766,5.786,5.2931,0.6926,0.7863]}

You return to your own time to find the world completely free from Nuclear Weapons, and as a result, the United States of America has Taken Over all of the Major Super Powers, Influence the War in Afghanistan, and Is running the World as it Was in 1900.\nBut things are not exactly what you planned...\nDive into a unique journey of Time and Space as a young boy in 1900. Set in the same universe that the novel A Time Machine used to be set, it brings the reader back to the beginning of the 20th century, while putting us in total control over the fate of the 20th Century!\nThis is, indeed, only one of the many ways that we can go back in time, using a machine, a time portal, or we can simply do it by going to a different Dimension. The Time Travel games include all of those possibilities, in one single game as well as games focusing only on one of the many ways of time travel.\nTime Travel Games can actually be classified in two different categories : The Dumb Ways of Time Travel and the More advanced Time Travel Games.\nAt a very basic level, you play by walking through a Game World in which you can Travel across different Timelines. Once you have Travelled, you can also switch between the Game World and Other real worlds, making it possible to do things in the Game World that are not possible in real life. This is the Dumb Ways of Time Travel.\nThis type of Games can be played with a Virtual Camera or a real camera, using only a mouse click. The result is just a very simple time-traveling Game. The real power of these games comes from the advanced Time Travel Games in which you get to Control some aspect of how the Time Travel Game will take place.\nTo really have a big impact on the Storyline, your actions will affect other people, events, and the development of the Storyline in the real world. A good Time Travel Game will involve much more than just time traveling between Timelines.\nThe key ingredient in Advanced Time Travel Games is the power to control the past and the future. You get to control the decisions, and the actions, as well as some of the consequences of these decisions and actions.\nThis can sometimes be very scary, as an action you make in a different Time Line could have real consequences in your real life. In those cases, you will have to face up to some difficult decisions between keeping your faith in Time Travel Games and following the strict rules.","token_len":536,"entropy":[10.947,0.8853,1.07,10.5196,2.5577,2.3907,4.8632,0.5261,3.1884,1.316,1.0498,10.8233,1.649,3.0359,10.6244,8.2432,0.0699,5.6432,1.5926,1.0964,5.1243,3.354,1.8927,0.8867,3.1043,6.0754,0.5728,2.6505,3.3098,0.5719,3.2632,2.1772,2.6354,3.9748,5.5286,8.0078,2.3955,9.975,2.2756,1.2245,0.9208,5.0969,2.013,0.6679,0.8523,2.0287,4.6225,0.0568,2.107,0.0395,1.8487,13.1536,2.3391,4.0173,0.4987,1.3346,8.4073,6.0174,4.7404,2.6078,12.289,2.6259,5.7058,2.2441,5.1939,0.2619,0.5312,6.5448,6.7387,1.9567,1.1472,4.4074,2.7372,3.1989,2.5636,2.335,0.3841,1.5825,10.8545,5.7556,1.5579,1.2632,3.9798,2.2949,3.158,6.6397,4.0367,0.8432,5.7654,5.3664,0.6499,2.5951,6.5233,6.9689,1.8164,5.404,2.677,1.612,3.2758,3.4419,2.5354,1.5111,2.353,4.6184,1.123,5.1943,0.6817,1.2632,3.8683,1.9781,4.0333,2.392,5.8568,6.8735,0.7903,1.2451,6.7976,0.3893,0.8778,3.1126,1.1068,4.023,4.9129,2.8867,3.1157,1.7428,0.4871,0.7504,3.0088,0.3486,0.6572,2.5225,0.016,0.553,1.2078,5.1823,6.4405,4.1724,1.0369,8.4658,0.1611,2.3429,0.8639,3.9834,0.0308,0.811,5.1385,0.0706,1.2757,4.1758,0.8957,3.43,1.3629,5.4093,5.8343,0.0197,5.8976,2.7491,1.1227,1.2932,1.7074,4.0185,1.4617,3.6941,1.6545,4.7267,0.6358,1.2685,0.0397,1.9791,6.0854,2.9854,7.9229,3.0272,2.0508,1.7984,3.7255,0.1857,0.9722,7.1422,0.3089,3.4482,4.8067,2.0073,4.3285,3.9766,3.0036,1.884,0.8249,7.7996,1.2993,2.9812,4.1078,4.2314,7.2646,5.2193,3.2829,1.3718,3.3675,1.1286,0.7332,4.8639,4.0791,4.9115,1.6167,5.3901,0.4621,1.1519,6.6878,8.2512,5.2154,0.0285,3.5323,3.4567,0.6976,2.1889,3.3917,3.0096,3.7878,0.1285,0.6559,0.7733,3.525,0.8705,1.7079,4.7346,6.5857,0.5397,6.4193,2.9416,1.9679,1.4861,2.2769,5.7667,3.3135,11.3512,6.6978,1.3502,0.1797,0.3883,1.3836,0.663,5.5627,6.5459,2.3128,0.3727,1.6172,0.3627,0.7981,5.8204,3.6707,3.3387,0.598,0.0291,0.2065,3.0354,3.5748,6.021,6.5179,1.1678,1.329,6.7444,2.8383,2.9979,0.7598,0.8456,2.5186,6.415,4.082,3.0506,8.3107,0.3457,1.3236,5.0625,0.2068,1.7723,7.5333,0.0372,2.626,0.3441,0.9537,3.5712,6.5798,1.2455,1.967,6.3391,0.4577,0.8544,6.096,10.4471,3.7986,1.8457,4.7447,1.4018,1.6782,0.2571,4.3846,2.6091,3.3799,2.1833,2.3008,0.0702,1.8249,1.9451,1.4265,0.8259,0.4821,1.514,1.3595,0.348,2.958,1.2928,2.7323,6.4374,0.8581,0.301,0.0552,0.0717,1.9474,0.7131,3.3778,5.033,0.0057,4.0847,2.4927,0.9201,1.5117,2.2623,1.7656,5.3014,7.1448,2.0175,1.7637,5.1908,3.3198,1.4484,4.4878,3.7889,1.6679,4.4287,4.317,0.9321,2.1099,5.8857,0.3713,6.1987,1.3105,3.146,1.0957,3.7764,2.4193,0.571,4.6865,3.9937,2.7514,2.7274,4.6209,8.5211,0.5282,2.7667,1.3307,3.0954,0.3271,0.5736,8.613,3.3877,0.1982,1.1065,3.981,0.3063,0.5036,5.1106,0.3414,6.048,5.334,7.8947,0.0261,5.6834,1.0607,1.8996,1.6649,2.4062,4.431,4.2265,0.2676,0.5651,0.6561,4.1497,5.3757,4.7991,1.0041,5.8445,0.6892,0.2796,0.9953,6.5503,4.2936,0.8225,5.2626,3.7065,1.6665,3.6523,3.7772,4.1379,2.0942,3.9064,0.7722,0.7755,2.2365,6.4493,0.0917,0.3902,2.708,0.8882,3.2606,1.8107,2.5724,0.1206,0.2862,4.7116,3.328,3.6479,0.273,1.0912,1.6567,4.296,5.4232,0.363,0.5914,0.4132,4.9076,2.9447,6.1142,3.6262,0.0232,0.7362,1.4916,2.2195,6.054,7.4477,1.9438,8.5327,0.1931,0.0303,0.0604,0.307,1.2034,4.6615,2.3783,2.1747,1.2939,5.1493,1.5237,2.0348,0.2764,1.0604,2.8846,4.5943,0.2582,1.2766,1.1576,5.9609,3.0759,3.244,1.3094,2.6724,1.9544,4.0356,0.3321,0.0542,5.1705,0.8515,0.1083,3.6835,0.9069,2.6346,0.4436,3.2612,0.8233,0.3481,0.9102,2.9999,3.5212,6.2571,0.7224,2.6644,4.2421,0.9736,2.055,5.6676,3.7858,3.1197,3.0986,2.1321,1.3237,4.5026,1.0782,7.7834,2.6305,2.2891,5.6646,0.4111,2.6937,2.0958,3.8834,0.5581,0.5721,3.1173,4.7116,0.6321,0.2421,0.9809,2.0861,1.2832,0.4939,4.7086,2.7571,0.0183,3.8298,4.4521,0.6632,7.2445,8.4827,1.0006,6.7576,0.8576,3.8982,1.5393,2.9455,1.0614,4.7923,1.4788,7.4828,0.8628,2.7172]}

{"prompt":"You live in Hidden Valley . You 're the only one in town who does n't like ranch dressing .","text":"You live in Hidden Valley. You're the only one in town who doesn't like ranch dressing. Nobody likes ranch dressing. You're all right now, though. I thought we were having great fun, but your friends might be a little embarrassed. Hey, what's up with you and your family today? And I always told you you can come to me if you have problems. Well, you have. The police officer said that you had to be in the car, and you had to get your family out at the school. I hope we 'll get to see the rest of the carnival today, because I think the parade might be great. I used to be a dancer when I was younger. We were taught at the carnival. My sister and I taught a trick with a flower, and we got five dollars for it. That was really cute. Yeah, I got a friend who taught me a number of different things. But I'm not really good at it. Everybody makes trouble. We were just laughing, and I almost ran over him. Do you have any idea what kind of car it is? I had a friend who just got it. She lives in New York. I think it's a Honda. It's pretty cool, isn 't it? I really, really like your picture. I like yours too. I told Chris that we should start a rock group. My dad has a guitar. So... it was nice of you to come with me today. I really, really like being your friend, because you really care about your family. It meant a lot for me to come out here. And...I love you. Love you too.\nRace 1 - The opening race of the day was scheduled for 10:00 a.m. The race was to start from the top of The Punch Bowl. On the first lap a crash occurred to a front bumper with no damage to the car. The cars were brought through a 2 lap caution because one car, running for the victory, was making contact with a yellow caution mark. The race resumed with a restart at the top of The Punch Bowl. On lap two, the cars hit a yellow caution mark and restarted in the middle of the track. The race continued until lap six when driver Greg Norman hit a yellow caution again and once again restarted in the middle of the track. A caution on the backstretch gave the fans a chance on lap seven to have a closer look at the backstretch cars as they raced to the finish line. For this race Tim Clark won first place, Greg Norman and Mike Hagan finished second and third, respectively.","token_len":536,"entropy":[6.9476,0.4318,12.4224,0.924,2.7001,2.4493,2.59,3.539,1.6557,0.6969,2.4743,2.1862,1.5595,2.4871,0.0004,3.7845,10.5674,5.4556,0.5933,6.5735,1.6796,1.7662,0.0723,0.5711,2.4129,1.4014,5.2583,3.5757,4.6988,1.5154,4.7476,0.6167,2.4205,5.2007,2.3701,0.8579,4.2071,5.7031,2.0365,2.4969,1.0119,4.7757,4.5031,6.7974,1.8481,3.8654,0.2785,5.8463,1.3193,5.9566,0.221,3.7621,1.0138,1.513,1.6025,1.8361,5.0608,1.0223,3.6699,5.9441,0.3398,4.769,2.5414,6.5058,4.4991,0.327,2.8215,4.0278,4.8333,2.5869,2.9468,2.5928,0.0843,4.2555,4.8186,0.8417,3.9161,0.09,2.0404,3.2495,3.8223,4.4516,5.548,4.6246,2.8589,2.4822,1.77,3.2443,1.9252,2.9257,2.6076,1.4739,2.1229,2.5148,1.6494,1.8392,2.4233,0.0963,2.2516,3.5581,5.6045,1.1019,6.3065,1.3594,6.1363,0.6963,2.0879,5.5155,3.7185,9.7428,1.9605,1.45,2.4327,2.9214,2.7923,3.0222,0.1163,1.6105,10.4111,0.0842,5.4672,2.1751,2.6353,1.5837,2.5021,3.0337,6.2275,4.4758,0.6302,4.8133,0.8086,1.9123,7.3556,0.0123,2.328,1.3844,4.7367,3.868,0.1476,0.1393,2.3678,0.8554,4.225,2.7082,6.0472,4.9145,1.2752,1.7403,0.0071,3.6658,4.2232,2.9577,2.1735,0.2168,5.6892,4.2727,7.024,5.3701,1.5039,5.8728,2.4725,0.5795,2.4394,3.2038,6.527,4.0224,1.563,1.1409,0.2851,3.4987,1.3827,4.5508,5.4997,0.4603,5.8258,0.2864,1.5757,3.0405,1.7715,6.8389,1.1513,3.6334,0.9689,2.3688,6.7679,0.8223,3.4381,1.526,0.7862,3.1591,1.387,2.5427,1.5247,2.8647,2.7221,0.1994,1.4351,0.5279,6.2658,5.0931,6.0779,1.1473,3.3255,2.9571,3.3128,5.5765,2.7211,0.9908,1.2849,6.2393,4.4739,2.7294,4.0107,0.7138,6.6479,0.118,2.6367,0.9041,1.5314,0.9483,4.2103,0.0022,5.4694,2.8743,0.7897,0.345,1.685,4.007,1.306,2.9359,0.8606,4.4087,2.6586,5.4589,2.1696,3.5275,5.9546,0.5179,4.8267,1.0079,1.2162,1.8067,2.7511,1.6164,0.3846,1.3495,4.9644,1.4572,2.1159,0.4275,3.724,2.8629,1.6865,3.819,9.7516,0.4593,0.007,0.0445,1.7589,5.006,4.9929,0.0411,1.1079,5.1285,7.6982,0.4737,1.5831,3.1145,4.6676,0.9898,0.3471,1.5936,5.4976,8.6411,2.0404,2.836,1.7575,5.2291,2.136,7.9418,4.2204,1.5042,5.2176,3.0856,3.7509,1.0385,2.2188,1.3997,3.9876,6.2232,4.7998,2.3974,3.3054,2.7363,1.755,0.1734,2.3547,2.8848,0.9178,4.8354,0.342,1.5896,3.6522,3.0614,0.0202,0.9634,6.2553,4.9111,0.8926,2.1187,3.9853,1.5988,3.6228,4.3037,0.3465,2.3358,1.463,0.4933,2.903,7.6526,0.3027,0.0413,4.1064,0.7648,1.1824,1.6929,3.189,1.2553,1.4823,2.878,4.832,5.3413,3.1464,1.3029,1.3509,5.1176,0.3357,0.8526,0.5309,2.7707,11.5228,4.82,2.8088,3.4739,8.377,3.4197,1.3763,0.9676,3.3898,2.8551,8.0743,0.7628,3.4301,0.4512,1.0115,2.0981,0.001,0.0004,0.2149,2.8174,1.8084,1.323,3.2832,2.0598,3.7937,1.0733,3.4979,0.4803,5.3395,10.5833,5.224,1.6306,4.9904,0.8694,2.537,0.9214,4.727,7.5534,1.5871,5.7423,2.7511,6.5644,4.3426,5.3868,3.8346,3.4562,1.7981,0.4016,1.5453,0.5021,1.0897,5.4542,0.9191,5.3891,6.2452,2.2899,6.493,6.9691,7.6224,5.6421,4.8564,2.6886,4.7446,6.1283,5.1933,2.3134,6.6165,0.5998,1.5299,7.2958,3.2473,0.1063,1.3893,5.4736,5.6692,6.7462,0.7033,0.9766,2.8268,5.2144,3.1933,1.5074,4.7405,1.9261,1.5418,2.3818,0.2532,0.848,0.1123,0.0617,0.7874,3.4155,1.5894,3.2146,1.3695,1.1369,2.8275,4.4209,1.1624,3.936,1.1521,0.4729,1.6527,6.595,0.0531,4.0211,1.077,2.4948,0.2885,0.2529,1.7143,0.2874,1.1862,2.0147,2.5064,1.9377,1.3267,3.0177,1.7436,7.263,5.0441,6.108,2.8168,0.7124,1.1598,0.3893,6.6565,1.5465,7.3862,0.0893,4.0425,0.0092,1.9909,0.2243,0.3011,0.0276,0.1158,0.1942,0.183,4.5028,4.5436,4.7059,0.6628,4.2879,5.8369,0.1111,5.6978,0.8169,6.9734,1.2237,1.9514,7.3436,1.6562,1.5754,1.8419,5.2221,1.2106,4.1504,0.2605,0.2067,0.2758,5.3412,1.9565,0.0003,6.3739,3.8017,0.5163,3.8999,2.226,0.7065,0.7232,1.381,0.21,5.0911,3.4212,0.9114,9.7154,5.8131,3.217,5.2469,0.5025,2.5879,6.3825,0.3408,4.8624,4.9803,5.2021,5.4195,2.676,0.6981,0.6579,0.8805,2.1883,0.9779,0.4513]}
{"prompt":"Nobody knew his humanity was n't entirely gone . The Lich had only ever loved one thing , his pet raven .","text":"Nobody knew his humanity wasn't entirely gone. The Lich had only ever loved one thing, his pet raven. Now it was gone, and a Lich was nothing but the cold, lifeless, body that was now being dragged around like a sack of garbage. He had to pull on his rage and let it out, make him feel the agony that he suffered. The Lich had to feel the pain that his world wrought on him.\nBut how. Was there any way? How could he do it? How could a body of water just disappear. She had no idea, neither had I. Then she pointed her head up toward the sky and I realized the answer was in that stare.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back home,\u201d she says, still glued to my shoulder.\u201cSo\u2019s my raven can keep on living.\u201dAnd she lets go of me, lets me slither away, heading for the sky. I\u2019m no longer so terrified, not anymore. I simply open my eyes and look up, taking in the blue sky, but everything is gone. Not even a ripple in the water. And if she can disappear, so can I. Suddenly I\u2019m not so scared at all, not so terrified anymore. The ocean is just as beautiful as ever, but I\u2019m more than ever alone.\n\u201cSo this is what it feels like to be a lich.\u201dShe says and then she just takes a step back, letting her body drift away. I know we won\u2019t see her again, and I just sigh, wondering where the hell she is looking. We won\u2019t be able to tell her what we are doing, or we would. We don\u2019t know how long our bodies can be together when we are done. I remember something I heard a teacher talk about last week; the ocean is the biggest vacuum I know of. It can suck you whole for a lifetime.\nI\u2019ve had it with this place. I\u2019m going to get out of here, I\u2019m going home. She would never leave me just yet, would she? I don\u2019t know.

Did you enjoy yourself? Would you like to do it all again? Would you live and let live? Do you always want to be right, or does this happen? I don\u2019t see myself being right all the time! I am just trying to do as much as I can. You don\u2019t need to tell me what to do, if you were a smart girl, you would have done it your own way. And a good thing for you, I am not a smart girl!\nBut I do believe in a fair fight. And no. I don\u2019t want to play this fair fight game! And if people don\u2019t like me taking what God has given me, then they have their answer! That\u2019s not fair!\nGod says that you are more important than what you own, or what you do, or where you come from, or how good you look, or how rich you are, or who your parents are, or how smart, or pretty you are, or anyone else\u2019s opinion, because if you let those opinions define you, you will not be yourself!\nI am pretty, I am smart, I am rich, my dad is a great man, my mom is a great lady! I am special, because of who I am not who I think I am!!! I am not my skin color, nor do I make the decisions, nor determine if I am going to be a good mother, or a good wife, or a good daughter. Who says I have to be \u201cgood enough \u201d to be with you! As for being successful, I have not achieved any goals in my life, I have just been living a good life!

{"prompt":"You wake up in a world where music is a schedule 1 drug .","text":"You wake up in a world where music is a schedule 1 drug. you wake up in a world where the new age, the music scene is just a joke at best. it is the music scene that is more corrupt than the politicians. it is the people that are more corrupt than politicians and its the people that know how to lie and take money from those who they think are stupid enough to listen. well, we dont need to be sold our souls at any point in life, there are plenty of people who can help out for free. yes, its not the best of times to live in this age, but i think it is still a better one that 100 years ago, where you just had to put up with things you hated, like having to carry in your pocket a tin of condensed milk when going out that day\nthe only problem with music is some people dont want to listen to the music they like. it is like people, you can love dogs, but some people wont let their dogs in the house. some people just cant stand the music they like. there have been times I have been at a big music festival and been surrounded by people whose brains are so wrapped up in what one of the DJs has to say to their laptop that they dont even come out from the tent and chat.\ni have had people walk away from my show saying how great it was, when i really mean what they said to me was oh my god, you and your machine were just so amazing. and then i have had people say they want their money back. i mean, it has sometimes taken weeks for me to put together a gig, and then once it is put together another day is spent making a demo for it, after which comes a weeks time recording it, so by that point i am having none of their money.\ni am not saying all music industry people are bad apples, i am saying there are some that are. if you like a band and i have seen it and the sound has been great then support it. i am a DJ and have had so many times people come in to hear me play, and say i have nothing to put on this night and just want to have a beer. and there are days where i have to turn away so many people. one time a band came to the radio station and played a new song just because i told them

What did they leave you to prove that they truly and deeply cared for you? a piece of land. No, a house.A house! Where did you find a house for $200,000? Not in the auction, in a charity estate sale.

They looked up at the camera from the painting and smiled. They were wearing the same dress and Sophia was wearing the same pink shoes. She put the painter in mind and put her shoes in mind. A pink floppy dress, long floppy hair, pink shoes. She looked down at the shoes. She looked up at the girls in the painting. \u201cAre they real?\u201d \u201cYes, Sophia, they\u2019re real.\u201d\nSophia remembered that they were wearing pink shoes. She remembered that these drawings had been made by the painter when she was four and these were her wedding presents. She went to see her mother. She didn\u2019t tell her mother about the painting. She didn\u2019t tell her mother that her daughter was married to the painter. She didn\u2019t tell her mother that these two girls were the artist. They were her daughters and they were the artist. And they were in her possession and she let them be stolen. She wanted to put them back. She wanted to put them back in the painting and put the painting back in the house. She wanted to take them back and put them back in the house where they belonged. And this would be the beginning of her life. She would be the wife who wanted to put the painting and the girls back in the house and this would also be the beginning of the happy life she always dreamed of.\nNow you know you can find the best deals for these kinds of games from your local department store or even online, and you can get a lot more than you paid for.

Readers : write a furthering scene that reveals the solution in the comments section .","text":"Write a `` 5 minute mystery '' ( a short mystery the reader can solve using only the clues provided ). Readers : write a furthering scene that reveals the solution in the comments section. '' for some ideas on the subject.\nWhen a murder has been committed, and the perpetrators and the victim are all dead, is it reasonable to be sure whether the murderer was a human or a creature? If a creature it is very easy for the creature to have done it to avoid being caught or killed, so much so that it might be called psychopathic. But if human is the answer it must be an innocent victim who was forced to die, or an accomplice, which means there has to be a crime against somebody else as well.\nOne of the oldest traditions in popular culture is that of a person called the Mummy Hunter, who is a human who goes into the tombs of ancient Egypt and finds out the secrets of the mummies of the dead Egyptians. As time goes on, the people are getting more and more afraid of him, because they are afraid he has found the secrets of the dead to show the living. In his own life, he is a successful salesman; in his career as a hunter of secrets, a detective of truth, a writer of histories, he has written five books with a large following. Because he is a professional detective and historian, as a rule, his books are very detailed and scholarly and they always contain some useful information about the secrets of the dead Egyptians. The reader can be sure to learn something new by reading the books. What this makes it all right is the fact that the protagonist in fact went undercover. When he was the owner of a company called Mysteries & Mummies he put up his name under the pseudonym Harry Price to be taken as a consultant by the other companies involved in the deal. He wrote his books under the same pseudonym so that nobody would find out where he learned all the secrets. After all, the protagonist cannot take the responsibility of his success to himself.\nIf somebody tells you that he or she was once on the Mummy Hunter's list, it means that the person has been considered to be a monster, who deserves to be killed, at least with his whole family. So the protagonist in both his books on mummies and all his other writings is a monster, because he has found something a lot of people would have considered as private, especially if it has to do with history. Because it is a private matter, the book has to be protected. You are therefore advised to read the books with great care.

{"prompt":"Write the best cliff-hanger using less than 300 words .","text":"Write the best cliff-hanger using less than 300 words. If you want to stay in our contest, send out 500 words in 30 days!\nThe topic of the challenge will be a creature from the movie \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d but you are allowed to write about a creature from any comic, comic strip, storybook or any other media genre. You can include any character in the movie, but only if they are part of the plot at the time that you write the story. You are not expected to explain away an already existing character in the movie or show with your story. But, your story needs to tie back to one of the main characters in the movie; no references to other characters from other movies is allowed.\n1. The first entry into the contest will be a new chapter from Deadpool, written within the previous 30 days and available online any time after Monday May 29nd. The Chapter itself will have no character in it and the story will be about the events of the Deadpool movie. Deadpool will NOT be a part of this. You are entirely permitted to write a story based on the events of the movie, although it has to tie back to a character from Deadpool. Deadpool is mentioned briefly in the film, but in no form that would be part of the plot of your story. If your story references Deadpool (e.g. your character meets a Deadpool poster) it will be a minor reference and can be made if your story has to be published in the final challenge.\n2. The second entry into the contest will be the same Deadpool story plus 300 words that will make this the best cliff-hanger we have ever written. It should be the best ending to that story. If Deadpool\u2019s character in your story is killed, you have to say who they are and explain why and how his death ties into the movie. Your story can cover the whole movie, the trailer or a snippet of the movie. You can include all the characters from within the movie from the trailers or a small snippet from the trailer, but you MUST tie back to your own character in the original story. You can\u2019t include the movie characters from the trailer in the story for the challenge (please don\u2019t do it!) OR include something from the actual movie that is completely unrelated to your story. Your entry needs to include a cliff-hanger before it reaches the end of the 300 word excerpt. That is the best conclusion to any cliff-hanger we have ever had and it is the reason for this challenge.\nIf you win the first contest, your entry will be posted here on our blog at the last page of this article.","token_len":543,"entropy":[3.6722,6.5278,11.1598,4.159,0.2494,0.1157,7.5351,6.9519,1.8298,5.5329,2.1382,1.0097,3.4666,0.4103,2.1675,0.4636,5.407,2.7435,6.6378,5.9115,0.5559,3.997,4.1283,6.4861,0.7579,3.0898,5.1383,1.925,2.5012,0.9245,8.6491,8.4705,0.8862,1.7291,4.8868,2.9611,0.2477,4.2349,8.7201,2.2068,1.0857,4.3281,12.9398,6.1302,8.566,5.0767,2.8975,3.9557,8.3602,3.5169,2.6288,3.82,2.9145,0.1698,3.3948,3.569,3.8077,2.467,1.0535,3.3923,4.9125,2.9875,3.3603,4.4661,0.2802,5.1514,3.0355,1.7664,2.1748,0.2621,2.8775,5.7532,0.5913,3.0509,1.1954,3.9175,2.3622,3.4541,2.6108,1.5671,5.8955,1.2869,1.7017,2.1767,1.3548,1.3439,0.7018,3.8784,0.0112,0.6274,5.0109,6.1592,0.8717,0.5078,4.6255,0.6307,1.8739,1.2208,1.733,0.2767,2.8166,2.0073,1.4878,7.8368,0.0087,5.1258,5.1641,4.7215,5.3383,1.0719,1.7796,2.2064,1.3496,2.7965,2.0769,4.2184,7.6229,2.7246,2.1104,0.617,5.5276,2.4189,4.4057,1.6664,3.5786,0.1308,5.5981,4.3261,0.7383,5.3955,0.3339,0.3453,1.6685,0.3484,1.9114,0.1832,0.5518,6.3103,4.9936,6.8039,0.6851,2.4437,0.7873,2.8451,2.1259,1.3421,5.9468,0.1468,0.2797,1.1283,5.5152,0.6185,3.4399,3.4476,4.5774,4.1335,0.2071,0.4146,0.5177,0.3801,2.0174,4.9645,5.9763,2.153,7.8137,2.1124,4.7621,7.2109,0.7216,4.4105,3.7724,0.0681,3.4925,5.0609,3.3701,7.78,0.5637,2.4046,6.4457,4.6308,3.6529,7.8086,0.7296,2.3777,8.1524,7.3086,0.7604,3.2326,3.0337,4.8093,3.2345,0.1319,2.5509,2.8248,3.6977,0.7479,0.8039,4.3057,1.4614,3.8152,0.9308,0.6058,6.8118,1.729,0.6548,7.3994,1.4052,5.8139,0.5176,2.5858,2.9653,0.0068,1.7325,6.7741,2.9578,1.8641,7.6379,3.8728,0.044,1.252,2.1955,1.4719,2.7313,0.2257,1.1072,3.1896,0.3218,0.3092,0.5157,1.4573,5.7564,2.2917,5.0796,0.6805,3.1274,0.7945,0.2406,2.1561,0.8298,1.4411,4.612,1.1411,5.6764,1.7089,8.5714,5.7125,0.1898,0.523,3.6216,1.4161,0.4849,3.3464,3.2887,6.247,5.3155,2.9868,1.6061,4.3403,0.0018,0.4229,3.872,1.0317,5.3058,0.5789,0.2203,2.8832,3.3031,0.6042,5.4963,4.1817,4.2468,3.9861,0.0027,0.0002,0.6461,5.1038,1.4319,6.7165,1.8194,6.0315,6.8268,2.3874,2.6486,1.0278,0.6527,2.8013,5.6226,3.766,2.7764,5.1858,0.6497,4.7834,5.0423,3.2578,0.4181,3.482,4.1831,2.7948,6.254,1.9129,1.5459,5.5339,9.7154,0.4433,0.817,0.4658,0.0012,1.3127,2.3776,0.2683,0.5181,0.0533,0.0477,0.0989,0.1433,2.6454,4.9424,6.452,1.044,7.8941,8.2023,0.4034,4.3167,2.3555,5.8698,5.6779,1.8313,2.3372,1.0986,0.2668,0.0006,0.0044,4.3808,0.5693,0.3128,3.0475,0.3644,3.2234,4.0535,0.665,3.5269,3.0301,5.8885,1.9314,5.6946,1.1449,1.1232,2.2947,6.6613,12.1234,6.857,1.6022,2.9843,4.2856,2.5864,0.2708,0.9087,3.5909,1.2096,1.3943,3.1186,1.5742,4.9278,6.1256,5.0942,0.4419,1.9875,3.8497,1.3761,4.3959,1.405,6.071,1.2682,7.5362,0.8638,0.7169,2.5275,0.5873,3.6759,0.7396,3.2381,6.6047,2.5287,2.144,1.9051,1.1208,4.569,6.5228,2.0314,3.4585,6.9621,0.4606,0.9196,1.625,1.3024,2.3069,1.2828,2.3801,3.5694,1.1523,1.2162,1.5278,7.9809,0.5357,0.3296,5.0094,1.2836,5.0948,1.6397,2.8777,4.7216,0.7903,2.2078,0.3994,1.6241,2.5346,0.4854,1.7888,3.9599,5.888,1.2272,0.2659,2.8897,3.6858,0.7531,1.7362,0.4979,5.1467,0.761,0.5984,2.3036,1.8631,15.2893,2.9079,0.1788,2.7029,2.2691,3.5567,4.7905,1.5013,0.9412,1.3339,2.8903,1.2827,1.5066,5.2434,1.8012,6.479,4.402,4.7893,2.184,2.5407,1.6702,0.1353,2.6556,1.4484,3.9708,7.2253,3.8714,6.6399,1.8842,0.4345,6.6309,0.5263,2.2573,2.3356,4.5198,1.1833,0.1719,1.8827,0.8026,0.64,3.6376,4.9553,3.7268,0.17,2.8091,2.0497,5.9418,0.4451,0.0022,0.0028,6.614,1.8633,4.8453,0.8797,2.0754,0.6044,0.2126,7.976,1.0031,7.7166,0.6377,5.0805,1.5855,2.1426,2.7094,6.822,1.131,2.2551,2.0498,0.0272,0.0007,0.018,1.8971,0.0823,0.0768,5.0308,4.0498,2.06,1.218,2.2779,3.6673,2.6195,2.1899,2.9166,0.1515,0.5719,3.6482,0.3396,5.5371,1.5479,2.5897,3.0018,0.647,2.5687,2.2124,0.3119,0.5736,3.2888,3.3728,1.6705,2.0768,3.1618,3.8916,2.6445,6.1339,3.1653,0.8715,2.3251,4.623,0.45]}
{"prompt":"The Apocalypse began six years ago . Nobody has noticed until now .","text":"The Apocalypse began six years ago. Nobody has noticed until now. I have not died after all. I am still alive.\"\n\"For a second, they thought he lost his nerve. But not long after that, they found the real Zhenan Yu. Because Zhenan Yu will not be affected by the evil magic of his brother. Instead, he will be very angry. In the face of a human body, he is still more powerful than his brother. He is the hero!\"\n\"I had an extremely weird night. I had a dream. I dreamed that I was with my dad. Dad got up, and he made a weird and disgusting gesture. I was scared like a kid with parents. I think I am so scared. I did not want to wake up. So I thought to turn the phone off and go back to sleep. Then I felt the cold air on my face. I thought that I would find the warmth in the night if I could get closer to the fire. Dad hugged me for a long time. I cried in my sleep. Dad took his hands and kept me in his arms. I tried to fight him. Then he let go of my hands and began to scold me with his voice.\"\n\"How weird is this? You just have a kid and he says he wants to kill all the humans and take the world? I was angry. Dad, why do you want to kill the human race? It's all because of the bad things those elders did in the past. If it's me, I wouldn't go in, do you understand? I wouldn't give in to the evil elders and let them destroy the world. You say that, as if I'm your eldest, but it doesn't matter to me. The more evil, the more evil\"\n\"I know. Dad, it must be because of that, didn't you just say that the ancient book was very bad? Why do you need to kill all the people?\"\n\"I didn't say that, son. You only worry about your own happiness. Is the matter with humans that important? Human beings are too much. To them, you are just a little monkey. If they don't care about the people under their feet, why should they care about us, a species that is less than us? The elders used the ancient books as a means to control the world.

{"prompt":": the first astronaut dies on Mars . However instead of Heaven their soul ends up in Mars Heaven .","text":": the first astronaut dies on Mars. However instead of Heaven their soul ends up in Mars Heaven. The story is told through the eyes of the astronaut and we see not just her life in space, but her emotional upheaval as the ship and she themselves is sucked down into the space where the space station is located. As part of her job she goes to the rescue whenever there is a problem however after the first incident, she knows that she can never truly escape from Mars Heaven but the story then cuts away to show what happened. What I thought was a great way of showing that the astronaut can't escape her fate and her soul belongs to the place she once served. The story is told first person from the astronaut and the first person narration works really well and shows us just how much she has grown as a person due to the events that occurred to her. All in all a well told story told in a very interesting setting and well received by the readers. Recommended for new readers.\nOne question that pops up a lot in this review is how a teen can even read this book, this is something that isn't too hard. The book is well written and the story flows smoothly. The story is told in first person point of view and shows us just how much the astronaut has grown and changed as a person, however it does make the story a little more difficult to follow without a decent book jacket and book mark to help us find where we are in the story. This is all down to the fact that the story is told in a style of writing that is not usual for teenage girls. Some of the chapters include many short sentences, short paragraphs and often very vivid descriptions. While this may help explain the story line, it adds very little value to the story line and to the writing itself. It may also be that this is due to the book being written by a 12 or 13 year old at the time of its release, this would explain the style, however now a 15 year old is writing a story with a similar style and that tells a very compelling story, it is difficult to believe that she should have had to learn how to write like this and that it wasn't just a matter of writing a story. Overall and due to the style of writing and the fact it is a very good story I believe I can see the appeal of this book for teenage girls.\nThe story of this book focuses on the life of an astronaut from Earth. The author writes about some of her problems, but also includes some of the most interesting details about Mars. The Astronaut tells us about her feelings of loneliness, the importance of friendship and family, as well as the hardships that she might have to go through.","token_len":545,"entropy":[3.8517,4.8413,9.58,9.2123,3.0125,2.9183,1.3203,5.7723,9.8566,0.1303,10.6116,9.3711,5.6691,5.4165,0.1964,0.8849,3.1599,7.5296,1.1576,2.3192,3.8996,2.1433,2.0868,2.1587,1.1223,2.3367,0.0281,1.7228,2.8969,2.1592,5.6606,1.9195,6.7259,2.005,6.2698,3.4116,2.8659,2.0847,1.7081,0.0516,2.1437,6.198,8.3625,2.0454,2.7847,5.0555,4.4792,5.6201,7.0203,5.1302,6.1335,4.5998,1.1881,1.0212,4.4423,4.6033,1.8045,5.2856,1.3613,0.8691,2.0727,0.2379,3.9028,5.6024,0.0068,2.6253,4.7222,1.7452,4.3758,1.117,1.7135,6.6789,10.0139,3.1157,0.4757,0.7268,1.5214,9.0347,4.7798,2.1107,3.1472,4.804,2.9188,0.7235,6.4853,1.2822,1.4075,2.5932,2.5062,4.5933,2.8886,2.2151,2.7367,3.4897,4.1304,3.503,3.639,5.0768,6.2438,3.1313,1.8116,4.2059,3.9226,2.691,2.8239,5.63,3.3531,4.9733,0.6437,1.1951,2.8876,3.7767,2.3904,2.6687,1.8301,1.5893,3.4927,3.9485,3.0607,1.7424,3.4887,2.8131,2.5934,3.4873,4.4341,9.1426,0.5186,1.3519,6.3965,2.1622,5.5266,5.0268,0.9893,2.6652,1.6835,1.5846,2.2773,7.6226,5.0309,4.1264,0.7258,1.7227,1.8809,2.0946,3.69,1.6324,11.9336,6.7261,3.0853,0.0584,2.693,4.3515,3.4077,3.9874,0.1978,1.774,2.4587,2.5811,2.9785,1.8952,0.4495,0.5477,6.0659,0.0156,1.3893,3.8079,2.2109,3.3062,3.5624,0.0752,1.0909,5.0838,1.1745,0.0105,2.1461,5.0571,4.0954,0.6073,7.2707,2.5975,0.5509,2.3248,3.3212,4.1947,1.8268,5.0269,5.5145,1.1637,2.0381,3.9036,0.3748,5.1803,1.8798,5.1374,1.2342,1.0785,0.9099,9.4842,6.8748,1.583,5.0949,0.1851,2.8843,0.1398,1.8023,2.1628,1.2395,0.3895,1.563,5.2411,7.2539,3.7183,6.1219,4.1944,2.0123,1.0235,3.3628,4.8963,1.0785,3.4423,0.6975,6.4035,0.001,3.9981,2.5987,4.8706,2.4373,2.3794,1.036,3.6886,0.2557,0.7063,1.9724,2.2136,6.6255,2.8917,1.4415,1.2526,2.3542,1.2504,2.2332,1.6281,6.1061,0.0137,8.9481,0.5836,0.0154,1.2019,5.2075,1.8622,1.5029,0.0732,0.8451,2.0784,1.3344,1.02,0.5131,2.2062,3.9893,1.6274,0.3781,0.1188,3.3895,5.0075,2.1702,2.6271,3.4774,1.8863,1.8467,2.0978,0.6958,1.7318,2.7112,0.7308,2.3021,6.5359,2.5016,7.1559,5.5004,8.6213,2.7794,3.9327,10.5771,3.4537,3.0711,4.9752,4.4189,3.8634,2.7973,0.8763,2.042,0.4735,0.3692,0.3074,3.2577,1.0541,5.763,6.3952,0.0077,0.5863,2.667,0.0481,0.996,1.9295,1.005,2.3524,0.7961,1.5996,5.8893,3.3783,2.386,0.3632,1.0989,2.4462,9.4377,0.7224,5.4917,2.8988,1.2193,5.4504,1.1284,0.2731,3.7406,5.4684,5.0617,4.4014,3.2903,2.7855,5.1871,2.6258,1.2256,5.1942,3.5884,7.239,1.7754,1.6749,3.9836,1.9812,2.1885,5.3838,4.5145,1.5212,2.3806,6.6985,1.4032,1.0847,7.0526,5.9066,0.0296,4.2307,0.6702,0.3275,1.1171,6.4201,1.3962,5.7188,0.4687,5.7103,2.4091,0.3709,2.6382,3.652,2.18,2.0678,2.6195,2.2053,0.9951,4.924,0.0328,0.4193,3.7965,0.561,2.641,2.6251,0.7413,6.1405,4.459,0.3906,0.021,0.0061,4.9718,0.3568,0.1098,1.0411,3.9289,1.2102,1.7534,3.09,3.4497,3.6798,1.3285,4.9534,4.3154,3.6323,7.0614,4.6263,4.5598,0.2259,0.0102,1.9386,3.9079,1.4769,2.1015,2.8387,1.3176,4.0039,0.6054,1.4114,4.163,6.3945,1.6269,2.1626,5.7123,0.1897,3.2415,2.543,1.3998,3.8627,0.4389,4.2966,0.953,4.1374,5.0049,1.6091,4.4208,1.8927,2.7561,2.783,0.0775,1.2384,4.5128,0.7202,3.2891,2.5936,3.1822,4.3589,0.0008,4.1314,1.1785,1.7934,0.0022,2.5713,1.7278,1.522,2.0105,3.4511,6.7233,7.0875,0.0036,0.5479,3.4832,0.6051,0.5126,2.7388,0.8648,1.5804,3.9371,0.6988,2.1534,2.7919,3.0826,1.0638,2.9598,4.9321,2.9912,3.2131,4.4635,2.3146,3.8153,0.5756,0.6664,0.6015,1.9366,5.2659,0.2683,0.8294,1.4005,2.2108,1.6177,2.455,2.9145,0.3384,6.3561,0.2821,0.8711,3.343,0.1933,3.1962,0.1557,3.9188,2.0348,1.4478,1.433,3.4966,4.2369,1.6877,5.513,0.4992,2.3232,5.4483,2.2618,3.3468,1.7961,5.4812,1.2044,1.7766,0.8446,2.5386,1.6501,2.8298,1.4941,4.7435,1.4997,1.251,8.4428,0.386,4.4287,2.3245,0.9714,0.9554,5.0822,2.8323,1.5945,1.2523,3.4713,4.7844,0.0596,5.0529,0.6934,5.6043,1.1011,4.758,0.0611,0.0285,1.6376,4.119,1.6409,0.955,7.1293,2.1333,2.1313,2.0456,0.0027,2.1589]}

He ends up blowing his cover in order to save your life. Once you leave, he has to leave with you too. The pair travels throughout a world he now knows intimately, but which they had no idea before: their own home. This story was inspired by a real person, and written in 2015 but kept in a draft state for 7 years.\nThis book begins with an unnamed protagonist who is standing alone in the middle of a forest, feeling the need to do something and not being able to help himself. Then he\u2019s struck by lightning, awakening from a near-death experience to find himself on the verge of death. His body is barely moving, yet his mind still functions. With absolutely nothing but his flashlight as a means of defense, he gets up, slowly finds his way, and climbs out of the trees toward a clearing in the middle of nowhere. What he discovers is the site of a fire, and a burned-out car on a nearby ridge. In a state of panic, he decides to stay where he is and wait for someone to come rescue him. But the scene that is following is one he was never expecting, and it is a scene that he never wants to repeat. It\u2019s full of death, brutality, a mysterious presence with a mind of it\u2019s own, and the promise of another journey that he is going to not want to take. This is the first of a four-part story with this mysterious figure as an unexpected component.\nA boy called Jack finds a box with two dead bodies inside. The police are all suspicious of him, but Jack is told he can do a deposition and make false testimony in court to prevent a police investigation, and he will not be punished. With that he is ready to testify that he found the bodies, and that he took them out of state by boat. The police have their own theories of what happened to them, and Jack doesn\u2019t care to know.\nWith a strong voice that will leave a lasting effect, this unique story takes place in a town of 200,000 people, that is full of dangerous animals and people, people dying and living, a mysterious plague, and a history of people finding themselves stranded in the midst of a natural disaster. There are several twists and turns in this story that has you on the edge of your seat in horror as you discover what\u2019s going on, and what it means for the people of this small town. But it\u2019s not all about the mystery. From the very beginning it had a compelling storyline that kept me interested until the end.","token_len":545,"entropy":[11.1646,0.995,3.2001,0.6733,9.4147,3.1888,4.8994,7.4398,1.6489,1.0151,2.3146,1.0542,4.457,0.7826,0.7578,1.8834,8.4003,0.0265,7.6072,2.674,4.6437,3.1247,2.7074,0.0184,3.4966,3.5841,1.0513,0.54,6.1998,1.2671,4.6171,1.1685,1.1882,4.2618,1.4095,3.2994,4.0028,0.4939,6.282,0.3311,3.264,8.6191,6.6572,6.2649,4.0143,3.9267,5.944,6.6082,1.8792,7.1192,1.7112,3.0344,4.5932,3.3033,5.1533,1.9411,0.9862,7.01,5.0959,4.3621,2.4484,1.8089,0.2811,4.1654,3.0138,3.4348,2.7967,0.0724,1.9034,3.5662,4.2592,2.1331,2.1767,5.5199,2.8288,7.0754,7.3591,5.6495,1.5,2.5469,7.1688,3.9178,2.3362,7.0758,0.3531,0.4578,1.3399,7.6293,3.0438,5.8162,0.6236,2.5469,7.0391,4.5691,1.5665,1.8887,6.2052,3.8708,0.7424,1.673,1.5277,0.0078,0.805,3.6029,1.7936,6.0241,2.7454,3.6646,0.105,4.5288,0.1966,4.305,3.5403,2.8581,0.9712,0.0073,3.637,2.3772,0.2592,4.7,1.4749,16.8813,8.2521,0.9834,5.9134,0.7539,2.5155,1.439,7.6643,1.7091,1.2095,7.5861,1.2952,0.5213,0.6755,3.1873,1.4485,1.1401,3.5852,1.097,1.8726,0.0054,1.8549,0.3522,3.158,3.4788,1.4609,5.9906,3.5896,0.7475,5.0825,1.8005,0.8423,3.5269,5.3066,1.2812,5.0998,7.9883,2.7888,2.8947,1.723,6.7433,5.5737,1.6153,4.0573,0.2449,6.0986,0.2287,0.3665,5.212,3.3474,2.0448,6.2933,6.0792,0.7764,0.8286,3.9981,0.5579,6.0854,1.8318,0.3033,0.4047,3.2113,6.7,2.0353,3.9872,3.6358,0.6454,0.786,0.0245,1.2922,0.265,5.0573,1.5254,3.504,0.5927,3.0873,7.5748,0.2704,0.9675,4.9976,1.4532,1.3406,2.8016,7.8744,1.2189,0.0322,4.3452,5.3171,1.881,3.1547,4.2953,0.2969,4.1577,2.3749,4.7623,0.1941,2.4986,0.2788,0.3405,2.6863,0.1547,3.7138,3.1324,0.0383,0.1262,1.3097,4.7885,0.3375,2.6185,0.3053,0.7043,4.5293,0.0345,0.3006,2.9301,2.5016,6.1328,3.1313,4.1029,6.7134,1.8481,3.5329,2.6048,4.101,1.9726,2.7313,2.0232,0.6876,2.725,1.5109,2.5389,2.621,0.6218,2.7753,2.8337,4.394,0.126,3.2034,0.3435,3.0324,6.4473,0.3383,0.0083,7.1393,0.0237,6.1573,0.8259,6.7957,0.1818,5.9485,6.0117,4.0026,4.9099,1.9016,4.5199,0.9291,6.8184,1.2375,0.1106,0.8138,1.8446,1.107,0.434,2.697,5.6685,0.2647,4.3597,4.7583,2.9308,1.964,3.001,2.764,0.1228,4.7001,4.4227,0.1645,3.0725,0.4271,2.8127,1.1097,1.5913,3.2725,2.5204,1.9063,3.8501,1.1638,0.1052,1.4784,3.9345,4.4075,5.6652,3.3349,4.0431,2.9299,5.8546,8.1393,0.7276,1.1488,3.752,6.0059,5.2996,5.4101,4.0928,2.6238,6.4234,2.8596,4.1775,5.624,1.1409,1.7451,0.8369,2.4048,7.1892,2.0248,6.4776,4.996,1.4906,1.2072,0.6154,0.9577,2.0564,2.1438,5.1345,2.4145,3.367,4.6493,4.8552,12.8286,1.9409,4.3629,8.0183,4.6642,3.2928,1.6522,3.001,4.2386,3.5157,5.0359,0.7782,3.0846,1.332,1.3996,3.652,3.1396,1.1425,3.8266,0.9282,4.9948,2.9632,3.8666,2.5056,5.0468,0.2184,6.6472,5.0759,0.4917,4.6284,0.6309,1.5547,1.3207,0.9122,1.7413,1.0451,4.9307,0.7124,3.166,1.2706,7.811,5.5221,8.2752,0.8893,2.4388,2.0401,3.2542,4.473,2.3897,2.7584,2.9962,1.0768,0.4393,1.4056,2.326,0.2975,1.2204,2.1538,4.229,0.5346,0.3987,0.2092,2.9705,2.6595,4.5964,1.4013,3.3661,4.4052,2.4408,5.8155,4.2181,2.8478,4.4009,4.1342,2.7195,1.7423,4.9888,1.8291,1.368,6.78,1.1096,3.2803,1.1412,0.6022,0.7846,4.6411,2.9652,5.6326,1.0495,0.0397,0.4164,1.2533,5.2738,1.147,4.4864,0.0032,6.0451,4.1431,1.3766,2.8873,1.6275,4.7888,7.195,2.8265,2.9763,2.7005,4.3423,5.2981,7.1276,1.4329,0.6508,0.9599,7.1433,0.3905,3.5336,6.2544,2.1597,4.4947,0.8256,1.537,3.7282,0.0087,1.616,4.121,0.2595,0.2571,4.0866,0.9109,4.4621,4.5753,0.659,0.0269,2.2712,0.5735,0.4883,2.1996,6.8668,2.7814,4.7852,1.0629,0.2181,0.0589,0.303,0.0452,3.5903,3.7117,2.8428,0.7062,4.0108,1.8601,7.8793,0.1969,0.1181,0.7531,0.1914,1.6105,1.0607,1.4616,3.2122,2.3819,1.25,2.2761,2.8652,1.3807,1.0147,3.5473,1.0171,0.4361,4.6653,2.4692,1.1389,0.0308,0.0076,1.9094,1.8026,3.6274,1.1328,4.8942,1.21,5.639,0.6853,3.2515,0.285,2.8706,7.4736,1.725,5.5604,3.8253,1.7324,4.39,2.8232,3.409,4.4523,1.5716,0.3578,0.6708]}
{"prompt":"A single sword . A single word . A single world , turned upside down .","text":"A single sword. A single word. A single world, turned upside down. I used to think that everything happened by design. Designing the future. But we\u2019ve all been surprised. Just once. In a million years. Like that. I can\u2019t hide the hurt. No more ways to explain. I\u2019ve found out the truth. I haven\u2019t tried. But I keep wishing. I just don\u2019t know how to make it right. I\u2019m just not as good as this. You don\u2019t need a reason to understand. When darkness returns. I\u2019m not afraid anymore. I\u2019m not the one now. Let it go. I can\u2019t take the blame. I\u2019m not the one. Take the blame. I want it all. Only want the good, only love you for it. But I can\u2019t do this tonight. The memories can\u2019t wait. Don\u2019t stop me. I know what my dreams will be. (I just can\u2019t do it tonight. The memories can\u2019t wait. Don\u2019t stop me. )\nA dark horse came onto the block last night. \u201cHow Do I Do It Better\u201d hit number two on the country chart in the US and is also available to stream.\nThis dark horse had me hooked from the second chorus. What is it about this song that is so refreshing? I\u2019ll go as far to say that I can\u2019t believe someone would come up with a song like this. It\u2019s so fresh, sincere and soulful.\nIt just had it all. But if you\u2019re familiar with Nashville\u2019s formulaic Nashville pop, this might be a disappointment.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but if you listened to some of the country songs of the past few years, you might not feel the same way about this new dark horse.\nMaybe you\u2019re like me and have enjoyed some country songs for their originality. Sure, sometimes the songs can have their shortcomings, but it\u2019s a lot tougher to find a flaw in something fresh and spontaneous.\nSo if you\u2019re looking for songs that aren\u2019t the same songs we have come to expect for many a holiday, there is a new country song (and some folk music) waiting for you.\nYou can\u2019t hear this song but you\u2019re already singing along. The chorus has no words, just a few phrases to get the listener into the right mindset while driving down the highway:","token_len":545,"entropy":[8.0531,7.9321,3.341,3.1684,0.9688,7.7045,0.7317,1.1216,0.2887,7.3913,2.9083,9.5331,2.6646,0.128,1.1257,4.34,5.5843,0.6109,1.8486,1.4776,5.7421,5.7976,3.3416,6.0984,0.8231,8.5422,2.8474,2.8979,4.3179,1.4861,4.0367,4.6127,17.242,9.3598,4.4845,3.704,1.574,7.4438,2.5704,5.652,5.9913,0.9419,4.7027,2.2174,4.5065,0.3093,0.6095,6.2114,3.6894,0.9173,2.4916,3.4986,5.2174,0.6485,0.1656,6.7914,2.3203,7.1821,1.0486,4.6771,3.8759,7.8934,0.4765,3.4266,2.2502,1.6469,2.8437,0.2202,1.2804,4.2381,3.169,3.2987,0.997,0.3379,1.4321,5.4111,0.8468,0.3069,0.0333,4.846,2.057,2.5102,1.1068,5.3918,7.5273,1.2398,1.1991,4.1548,2.3745,0.1974,0.4211,0.3496,0.8702,1.5028,0.8776,3.6524,0.9144,2.8935,0.1881,1.2835,2.7182,0.0899,2.4407,3.7323,3.6416,4.4665,1.2055,0.4402,4.5249,0.8684,4.2384,3.1005,0.2207,0.2322,0.0707,2.8228,2.8249,4.9716,0.9971,5.176,1.2536,5.547,10.5933,5.4079,1.6244,2.022,3.2309,0.1106,0.3969,1.7306,5.0755,2.5101,0.1212,0.7246,1.7511,0.0507,0.4043,1.4408,4.7625,2.4388,6.6561,0.3405,5.8496,2.6903,1.7157,0.2514,1.487,2.6826,0.7904,0.055,0.0052,4.8177,3.0517,3.2677,0.5159,0.9667,1.9385,0.037,0.2736,0.9597,2.2604,0.2219,2.9806,7.1515,1.493,0.4797,0.8034,1.3143,3.6653,2.9431,1.922,1.399,6.4335,7.7276,3.1891,3.8844,3.0779,4.1724,4.2322,5.529,1.8045,2.5327,0.2836,3.1927,1.2888,2.2015,0.6794,0.0192,0.0042,2.6925,2.361,7.8843,0.1571,4.3432,6.2425,5.533,2.0767,0.043,0.1041,4.7597,0.4696,5.1339,1.4641,0.091,0.0234,3.9592,2.641,0.363,1.1348,3.8212,2.3635,5.1194,3.7578,3.301,0.7278,0.8679,6.2255,4.6113,4.7405,2.584,2.8404,0.0192,0.0029,3.5462,1.1839,3.2124,1.0368,3.09,1.3866,0.14,0.034,0.0128,0.0132,0.0174,0.6594,0.4427,0.0259,0.0093,0.004,0.0127,0.0064,0.1956,3.343,2.2609,6.1445,5.5602,5.9059,6.0629,6.611,0.2188,6.714,7.9371,0.2844,0.577,6.8338,6.3603,6.8513,9.387,1.4677,3.8643,1.0269,7.1017,1.8353,7.6148,11.4004,8.7714,2.4648,1.8211,0.9054,8.9791,5.0123,3.774,1.1733,3.5557,3.0768,4.2563,5.3536,4.9517,3.1175,3.4318,2.5817,1.8184,3.7408,6.7109,0.0289,4.8704,5.8235,5.1823,5.0179,0.9234,5.8534,7.7653,1.7686,5.4841,3.0526,1.6655,1.6047,1.7284,2.069,0.3685,2.9544,0.5188,4.7315,0.5234,2.1707,4.7778,0.4523,3.3683,4.2606,6.1533,0.6588,2.4253,0.3191,0.7152,2.018,3.6141,3.3547,0.0572,0.0201,2.759,6.018,1.525,3.8131,0.9961,0.324,1.9816,1.1689,1.2373,0.3631,0.656,2.0964,1.7196,0.0844,0.8917,2.495,5.4688,2.0398,9.0987,1.2062,6.0948,0.0166,0.316,3.3209,3.4368,4.775,5.3413,5.4693,1.0602,0.5885,4.9982,4.2174,0.8352,3.7443,0.2378,1.0033,5.5199,0.0133,8.856,5.7281,0.5528,1.3119,7.0502,5.1596,7.2248,6.0119,0.9376,2.6109,3.5422,0.8588,2.6549,10.124,0.3403,2.2231,2.2024,2.8578,0.68,0.0603,0.2192,1.0063,3.8384,0.2709,0.4281,0.1203,3.6046,0.706,4.691,0.1311,4.7734,0.3265,0.8576,6.0036,1.4008,3.6361,0.8284,1.4171,2.0747,0.2805,0.3302,0.591,1.5503,2.8783,3.9644,1.3336,0.216,0.4471,0.9841,0.932,3.7918,4.9853,0.0334,0.2761,1.9493,4.3129,1.6276,3.1084,0.049,1.8029,4.4857,0.3065,1.4419,3.1627,6.248,2.3655,4.6605,1.6076,3.454,7.889,4.5028,0.4247,0.8484,7.561,0.2742,4.7329,2.7094,2.9238,4.1017,4.3209,3.0695,6.3867,0.8217,0.3249,2.8136,1.2219,0.0453,0.0957,2.8365,3.3912,6.6836,1.138,3.4189,1.6805,5.804,1.1003,2.8513,8.7453,0.88,8.1889,0.7651,1.6565,3.8976,3.0938,0.2696,2.4542,0.0457,0.8957,3.3383,0.1354,5.8528,0.7155,4.5767,0.3066,0.1639,0.1862,3.9582,1.6666,6.0498,4.8593,3.0641,3.6163,0.4348,1.8371,5.4298,3.7969,3.9365,7.2865,1.0974,4.5147,1.2729,1.6705,2.8744,4.963,0.6082,6.602,2.7886,4.5016,6.2163,2.886,0.7186,4.1426,0.9695,0.0689,0.4464,1.0053,3.7249,1.8636,3.5384,0.0238,0.0024,6.8487,2.7162,1.3324,5.7675,1.1107,2.4363,0.0357,3.2041,4.0184,5.8902,2.6294,0.8012,3.2665,3.2448,3.2906,5.2005,3.0834,1.9469,1.4458,1.135,4.0982,4.4567,3.614,4.0148,2.9501,2.3619,3.1654,0.5867,3.7386,3.1653,5.689,6.3753,3.5118,0.5019,1.6247,6.9294]}

The Brain presides as leader .","text":"All of the major organs in your body are sentient beings. Every morning they have a council meeting to discuss the previous day and make new plans. The Brain presides as leader. It is like a councilor for the organs. The other members are the Heart, Pituitary, Testicles, Kidneys, Gallbladder, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, Pancreas, and Prostate.\nAfter your head has been informed that you are awake you are the boss! Your brain then takes over and decides which of the other organs should lead into activity. The liver asks the heart to stop beating and release the energy stored up in your muscles during the night. Your muscles feel tired, and want peace and rest.\nYour heart feels that your muscles have been busy and is excited because it has been in such good shape. The heart tells the liver to begin to process the energy absorbed during the night. You now feel like you are beginning to wake-up physically. Your liver is also telling the pancreas to release some of the stored up insulin, which has allowed you to use sugary foods. You now feel hungry. So now you begin to eat to energize yourself and recharge your body. You begin to breathe and your lungs begin to process the carbon dioxide you have taken in through the breathing process. Every organ of the human body works together to ensure that you have a steady diet, have sufficient sleep, energy to process the good and bad foods you eat and enough oxygen to keep you breathing life.\nThe brain is also now in charge and decides how to proceed. It informs the heart that it is time to begin pumping blood around your body. The liver tells the pancreas that it\u2019s time to begin releasing insulin into your bloodstream. Your heart begins to circulate the blood. By this time, all the other organs have finished their work and the brain is telling all of them to turn off as the brain is now more conscious of itself and the whole process that takes place in the body. The brain is telling the heart that it is now time to stop pumping the blood in the body and the circulatory system is now shutting off, the muscles are relaxing, the breathing is slowing, and sleepiness takes over.\nThe liver has released the energy stored in the liver in the form of glucose. The pancreas has released insulin into the bloodstream which makes the glucose available for your muscles to use. The heart has finished pumping the blood throughout the body so now it is going to stop beating and release more energy to your muscles, which is what has caused you to feel tired. The brain, has given consent for all the organs to stop working.","token_len":545,"entropy":[3.4238,1.5137,5.1333,8.2062,2.0526,3.5506,0.1898,1.2018,9.4094,1.9254,1.2853,5.2086,7.7676,4.7081,3.9392,1.6652,11.2214,2.7794,1.8944,1.0242,1.4935,8.1402,0.3914,4.1878,4.8153,4.8214,2.7023,1.008,2.3892,8.8568,10.5664,0.5041,7.1889,5.0808,1.8946,3.419,1.3298,5.7324,0.7159,3.2629,6.726,4.4032,1.3376,8.5225,1.6739,2.0349,4.9357,2.0196,1.3639,2.3049,7.3045,0.7886,8.756,2.2561,0.0015,0.3832,6.1886,1.1928,0.2805,5.9319,0.216,0.2385,7.7118,0.221,0.0041,0.2553,2.492,0.2402,4.3549,0.9083,0.1088,0.3598,3.384,0.8733,0.2449,4.2143,0.2022,0.0021,0.2082,1.6502,5.0053,0.4088,0.3162,1.9759,9.0758,4.552,5.5533,1.9743,0.3744,8.0985,2.8866,1.3618,0.9303,5.5229,3.1585,2.0565,5.9349,6.4735,4.7836,3.5307,3.2822,5.0148,3.6026,0.6288,1.787,3.4302,1.805,2.9673,0.4879,2.855,0.3975,3.6881,5.48,4.7699,6.8504,0.5286,1.7354,6.176,8.7568,2.061,3.3623,0.8024,5.4878,5.9612,1.3423,6.3,1.4142,4.3459,4.5515,5.1292,0.7418,1.8582,3.9395,5.3786,1.4757,3.2494,0.2772,3.0339,3.9531,4.5719,3.6672,1.7441,1.9256,6.3601,9.7587,2.1705,1.4361,0.2473,2.3517,2.4306,1.9442,5.5582,5.2155,2.8074,2.8958,1.7881,0.9751,7.1642,1.8697,4.8533,5.4977,4.4953,2.102,1.5656,1.0816,4.5601,4.5786,2.6957,0.9211,1.0841,1.7209,1.8626,3.8221,1.6339,4.4114,0.896,5.315,2.5087,3.8747,1.2048,1.0319,8.2248,2.6681,0.5219,0.4156,0.7555,3.1252,5.1823,3.1145,3.1026,0.9543,0.5546,6.5706,0.3822,4.1151,7.1753,0.0479,6.7334,0.5403,2.2356,4.4027,2.1459,3.7651,4.4192,1.3933,7.6583,0.0005,0.0002,0.5196,1.9076,3.0794,0.3695,0.5996,3.7598,6.5726,8.8849,2.6318,1.3353,3.5246,6.0651,0.7908,0.0506,4.5703,9.9464,0.19,2.4256,1.5963,2.6065,2.6833,0.6783,4.8658,1.6529,5.7792,4.0252,0.6467,4.5466,0.4066,2.1481,5.8709,7.6083,0.0624,2.9863,1.6817,6.1501,0.3648,1.5486,0.2996,2.5296,3.0391,0.2091,6.1362,2.063,3.376,3.4225,2.281,0.0849,5.7552,0.8665,6.7204,0.103,2.6235,1.9169,3.4021,1.3022,3.972,1.6384,6.2167,3.5814,0.1389,7.0985,7.2854,3.5943,1.4542,5.5171,0.0211,5.1297,2.3391,0.3664,4.5903,0.559,1.2598,2.5813,1.6229,4.5995,3.5736,2.6331,6.5392,3.4209,3.4086,0.4217,6.9343,2.9479,5.6409,1.1721,5.9479,2.5782,1.8473,3.634,2.1947,2.0937,2.1432,6.6541,4.2501,0.3599,2.2397,0.3741,5.766,9.9257,1.7318,0.6772,2.1864,2.5745,2.0477,2.3443,5.279,3.4426,0.3937,3.6276,3.3396,2.4404,0.6526,3.7532,0.7848,1.9728,5.9726,0.7698,0.9931,1.1018,2.027,1.2014,2.0439,0.1912,2.585,5.4625,1.9846,6.1177,1.7483,0.1628,0.6799,1.491,3.9163,2.1235,0.6657,3.4124,0.0006,0.0011,1.4152,1.0467,18.8978,8.7921,2.3971,0.3355,0.14,2.5557,4.2708,3.215,2.2424,0.5259,1.1057,0.5996,2.2621,0.8075,3.8481,0.2009,6.375,2.2294,1.5866,3.0073,5.4333,2.3839,0.2757,1.6582,3.3454,1.3867,2.4858,0.1006,1.7595,4.8078,1.7527,0.702,0.8667,2.9681,1.799,0.987,5.5255,4.8849,0.9784,1.7754,0.4422,4.8349,0.6858,6.3384,2.8703,3.0133,1.5439,2.5795,5.4867,4.3785,1.2884,5.0774,1.4859,2.6355,5.3256,2.5939,6.3982,3.7284,0.0055,2.4923,1.6308,1.5473,1.2309,1.9135,1.7753,1.8508,2.6346,1.0876,0.8971,0.9583,0.8281,0.5982,4.3332,0.7906,0.1015,2.7155,1.2805,3.0876,0.6588,3.9708,2.4137,2.4774,1.3112,4.3057,7.1239,0.0055,0.0471,1.3441,1.2385,5.5215,3.0833,3.415,3.9828,5.4109,1.4825,4.3347,0.9682,1.8381,6.0939,1.0532,4.4618,1.3035,0.4981,6.4388,7.6587,8.248,0.2512,0.147,0.8809,1.3845,3.3733,3.29,5.6433,1.5742,1.0599,1.606,2.981,1.6265,2.817,4.2466,1.5893,1.5626,0.0103,2.1245,0.948,1.4854,3.3751,0.0004,0.0029,2.3358,1.4862,4.0021,1.2076,0.7823,0.8255,4.5442,4.2727,1.6629,3.6118,3.257,0.9039,1.8335,3.1681,0.7242,1.0965,0.7731,1.0019,0.7361,1.1941,5.4244,1.561,1.0094,1.0012,6.7787,0.5771,1.0206,3.8156,4.886,1.5978,0.6359,4.5275,0.2584,3.6766,5.8565,1.3134,1.5453,2.8641,1.8315,2.423,1.6934,0.9379,3.2758,2.3388,1.7435,2.1168,4.0886,3.4498,1.676,0.0546,1.54,1.9495,0.8593,1.5684,2.1288,4.8579,7.7231,4.4855,8.7048,1.565,3.7043,1.8596,1.4601,0.5156,2.3595,3.0504,2.1018]}
{"prompt":"God comes down to Earth , telling us to stop praying to him .","text":"God comes down to Earth, telling us to stop praying to him. But if he doesn\u2019t come down, do we have to believe his God is a big liar who lies to us, and the people of his god, too?\nI don\u2019t know what you mean when you say that. But, are you telling me that if you stopped talking to God, he would come down and help you?\nIt would be good to find someone who\u2019s been out of the church for a while or a long time, maybe some months or a year, and is in the \u2018spiritual wilderness\u2019, who doesn\u2019t believe for a long time. That person could help us understand why all of this is being done.\nI\u2019m wondering if you have had a similar experience? If you have, do you think you would share your story?\nYes, I have. And, again, to try to be in the \u2018spiritual wilderness\u2019 for a while. It could be in the house being built, I could be on the road, someplace like that. It\u2019s up to you.\nI\u2019m trying to help make the idea of spiritual wilderness more understood and less dramatic because I don\u2019t think people realize we\u2019re all on a spiritual journey.\nI have been to one of your events and really enjoyed it. You\u2019re a great pastor with a tremendous heart for the church. I know that some people have misconstrued your opinions and what you\u2019ve said. I also know what a long and varied journey you\u2019ve been on as a pastor. In the spirit of learning from you, I\u2019m wondering if you would be willing to answer some of my questions regarding baptism in the name of Jesus and the doctrine of a universal salvation. We have our own church and we\u2019re still trying to come to a decision regarding these doctrines.\nThat sounds great and the church would definitely benefit from your experience. If you don\u2019t mind, and if you think the question is mature enough for your experience, feel free to take anything you want to go back into the wilderness and come back and I will read it and if you want to read anything back to us, great!

{"prompt":"Everyone in the world develops superpowers between the ages of 8 and 12 such that the strength of the power increases with the age of development . You believe you are finally starting to discover your power at the age of 18 .","text":"Everyone in the world develops superpowers between the ages of 8 and 12 such that the strength of the power increases with the age of development. You believe you are finally starting to discover your power at the age of 18. What is the relation between your ability to take on a problem and your age? You believe, at 18, everything is in your hands, and that is not really true. The truth is that you are in the process of developing your will, of developing your powers. Therefore, if you are able to solve a problem at an early age, it is because of an ability to choose that allows you to work for. It is an ability to choose that allows you to take action and not be constrained by other factors. Therefore, if you do not get to this point in time, let us say, at the age of 21, your will is still fragile and your powers are not so strong. But it is always possible to find solutions.\nLet you summarize these concepts with an example: Imagine these 3 teenagers who have the same weight, the same height, and the same age. If we say that one of them is very intelligent, the other is a normal intelligent person, and the third is an extremely intelligent person, what does this mean? Is it the same person? No! They are not identical. This is what is called the principle of non-repeatability.\nIt follows that, if you get to 18, you do not have the same abilities and will be at the age of a healthy human being, with the same abilities, will and health.\nHowever, what is a superpower? According to my book \"Super Power\", it is anything that enhances one area of your life. It can be any form of power, whether its physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, creative, or financial.\nThe point is that you learn to use this power at the age of 8-12 so that it becomes a part of your everyday life. From the age of 19, the use of this power gives you a strong will, the ability to choose, and to take action.\nWhat is the connection and the purpose of the universe with all this? Because by developing or developing your superpower, you also develop your consciousness and your spirituality. In other words, everything that you have, whatever it is, your mind, body and spirit, everything is connected between them through your superpower.\nThat is why I always advise my clients to get rid of anything in their life that they are not happy about. Everything is a choice. Get rid of anything that does not bring you joy and peace. If you do not want to lose something, then you have to find a solution for yourself.","token_len":548,"entropy":[3.7021,1.1827,2.6109,13.1144,7.0535,0.2863,8.9352,2.5197,2.0578,0.0218,4.2029,0.5586,2.1167,8.2521,1.7464,3.0821,6.6559,0.46,1.9,4.5361,4.1953,2.724,3.0565,0.5262,0.5727,6.7943,0.7042,5.3717,7.2329,2.378,1.4834,6.3191,4.5741,0.1962,5.2444,2.7611,3.266,5.2154,1.215,0.487,0.0327,3.5969,1.1069,4.1279,2.2735,1.5211,7.9021,0.3346,2.0591,3.1707,0.8119,5.5776,1.8369,2.1287,5.8995,0.3614,0.356,3.023,0.9584,3.691,2.5296,5.6544,3.76,3.432,0.1735,7.9027,1.413,4.1623,1.8151,1.3391,2.2869,1.4299,2.4378,2.713,4.795,4.3921,0.6773,0.3454,3.005,3.8967,0.2249,0.7756,0.9336,0.9837,3.4724,1.9501,2.3598,0.014,1.8841,1.0567,7.3097,2.1971,4.8534,2.4081,0.3114,3.5584,1.3386,5.1114,0.3901,3.1333,0.2088,1.3449,3.3102,0.068,5.4486,0.8531,0.1251,3.0896,2.9868,0.859,0.0242,0.3989,2.5493,0.7419,2.057,1.7933,4.9103,2.2449,0.4817,6.3,4.4233,9.1454,0.0773,0.063,5.0713,3.3492,8.0248,2.9985,0.3222,4.1989,0.8491,1.0022,2.3741,1.8245,0.5415,0.0478,0.0416,3.3177,3.5242,2.3897,3.6782,2.3661,4.362,0.3106,3.1092,2.7459,0.4516,3.836,0.1593,1.524,0.1642,4.3948,0.3056,4.5028,2.3731,3.6623,1.4926,2.7629,0.8784,0.2917,7.7001,1.8225,1.3491,1.5091,2.7324,1.729,0.2248,0.0217,4.164,0.2294,2.6926,2.9078,1.1428,3.4441,7.3601,1.5437,2.5633,3.2724,0.6122,1.9961,4.2294,0.725,1.1995,3.0,3.6847,0.4402,5.9806,0.8158,0.8789,3.5244,4.6833,2.5109,2.7235,9.493,7.2882,8.8812,4.5294,4.1936,3.4118,3.0086,0.5766,1.4657,4.5309,8.5866,5.8144,5.9554,2.4338,1.7933,3.961,1.5996,7.0588,2.2771,3.1804,0.143,0.9099,0.5662,1.3557,0.5898,0.0093,2.9414,0.7559,3.4379,3.8687,3.4069,0.8643,3.34,0.5208,0.2498,0.7463,5.4115,5.2542,0.5492,1.8052,0.345,1.5742,2.877,5.4176,6.7858,1.5561,1.2299,1.8788,1.5035,2.2684,0.888,2.9811,2.4678,1.2301,0.144,0.4479,3.2676,2.5492,1.3471,0.4746,0.2185,4.8232,1.4348,4.1087,2.0955,2.408,1.6176,3.4221,3.1675,4.3009,0.7256,2.3996,3.7226,0.9038,3.6106,0.7894,3.3552,2.308,1.2341,1.7007,6.9735,0.2357,4.9636,0.1911,9.6192,0.091,0.3648,2.2068,4.0952,5.2674,0.5605,3.2751,1.1438,0.9658,5.1701,0.2652,4.1675,0.5423,0.8451,4.292,0.0802,0.7189,1.8191,1.463,3.0128,3.0753,3.4946,2.8936,4.2812,1.3793,2.1662,0.1495,5.5503,5.7295,3.4122,0.2445,1.9802,5.2975,1.3664,0.2329,3.1122,1.9525,1.5838,6.1522,7.739,0.6505,2.3672,4.3329,0.0347,4.1255,1.5501,3.4552,9.3165,0.7284,4.841,0.0012,4.6269,4.6967,2.624,3.794,5.0455,1.4907,1.6132,0.2908,6.2755,0.5566,5.4935,2.4336,7.4729,0.1999,1.229,1.2949,1.1906,1.7817,2.9445,0.8776,3.0601,4.6915,0.1606,2.2374,1.3039,3.2104,5.2148,0.804,1.7422,0.7377,0.6186,1.6898,0.5001,1.0078,0.4974,5.7183,0.4505,1.973,5.9875,0.2215,1.9899,2.7796,4.3205,0.566,0.591,2.1416,6.3533,1.2474,1.9095,2.41,0.8896,2.728,1.7769,0.2016,0.0215,4.0422,3.5436,0.0789,4.7409,0.1927,3.1232,2.0555,1.8724,3.5714,0.0025,0.2671,2.7205,0.2106,0.4147,5.9399,2.6944,1.236,0.0946,6.1351,1.4008,3.2799,5.4623,0.1248,0.7518,0.1381,6.0365,0.1928,1.5619,4.1604,3.8326,1.9533,3.5869,0.5481,0.008,2.9719,3.4975,2.2211,1.4497,2.95,0.3914,0.52,1.5526,3.3986,0.921,0.8849,5.1273,6.228,2.0683,5.2049,0.2459,1.8956,6.817,3.7993,4.8243,2.0194,1.2625,4.7549,6.2016,5.4248,6.3503,2.791,1.4997,7.2427,0.6019,0.261,4.3131,2.0726,1.1048,5.7878,1.6273,1.7807,6.6184,0.3857,3.3035,1.2129,0.0023,0.0328,6.6309,1.8086,1.0769,2.2507,3.9573,4.8579,1.9585,0.1311,0.667,4.8359,3.5161,1.0374,3.6918,2.3597,1.5459,0.7568,4.752,3.0767,2.3753,7.0104,4.58,5.2562,1.1657,4.5077,0.2036,0.8792,4.838,0.3576,0.7206,2.6846,5.0018,4.765,6.4958,3.2807,0.2771,3.8412,4.5595,0.0046,4.8203,4.5408,0.7791,0.7393,0.2723,2.0068,2.6834,0.9234,3.8582,1.6552,0.7147,4.7401,2.5389,3.0425,5.8318,1.1291,7.4557,0.0158,0.0039,1.421,0.3422,4.1547,0.0139,5.0984,0.9801,2.1357,2.0154,2.9104,0.6653,2.8698,0.3674,2.31,0.3703,2.2804,0.3194,4.5139,2.7359,0.5928,2.0468,1.6025,2.3399,0.4429,3.5854,0.919,2.8925,3.3342,3.2545,0.3404]}
{"prompt":"A man wanders the streets distraughtly , looking for someone . However , the photograph he 's showing around is one of himself .","text":"A man wanders the streets distraughtly, looking for someone. However, the photograph he's showing around is one of himself. What could you infer from this?\nI suppose an adult would assume he wanted to find someone to kill - but I would also presume that it has something to do with his family, which seems to be a common theme in this type of story.\nI am an undergrad student studying for my first exams, so I don't have sufficient experience in terms of literary theory or anything, but I thought I would like to ask the opinion of a more experienced person who can judge this piece in terms of'meaning '.\nThank you.\n\nA:\n\nI think the main take on this piece is the symbolism. I think he wants to kill both himself and his family. He goes looking for someone to kill (that someone could probably be his family, but probably not himself) and he doesn't find anyone. He looks for revenge since he would like to blame any problem that hits his family on someone (and maybe someone had to do something to him). After he gets his revenge and his family gets what they deserved (I think the family is trying to steal from a man, but he finds that the victim is actually his own family), he wants to show that it was all worth it. He doesn't show a photo of himself, but the symbolism isn't really about him, it's about how he wants his family to remember him, in particular.\n\nA:\n\nI think you're correct about the symbolism. \nThe \"wandering man\" in this poem is searching for an opportunity to kill the man in the photograph (or perhaps, another man). The man in the photograph is in fact a family member (maybe close enough to be the \"wandering man\"), who has gotten into some money problems. Either that is, or something has happened to the man in the photograph, perhaps something in the past. The person in the photograph might now be one of a variety of \"other-selves\", perhaps looking for some kind of way to \"return to life\". \nThis poem was probably written before the Civil War, when family members, particularly wives, might look for any opportunity to claim more than they really deserve, and sometimes got away with it. The \"wasting away,\" etc. may be something he felt was done against him by his wife. Or perhaps, this is some way of showing his grief following the death of his child. Or, these kinds of things are often done by wives, and he may feel as if the man in the photograph is now the one \"wasting\" away, rather than his own family members.","token_len":548,"entropy":[7.3022,9.8261,0.002,3.1171,2.1381,13.6899,6.2693,1.634,2.8792,0.8159,3.71,3.2309,6.2242,0.114,2.4055,8.8961,2.2655,2.5942,6.0494,7.5089,3.5224,3.9837,0.5352,6.3169,1.2327,5.5118,3.5726,5.6274,9.6908,0.6018,1.5318,0.8534,0.9711,7.3821,5.082,6.2263,4.8294,2.0243,4.6009,2.8401,6.8068,0.4182,3.7018,1.0271,2.1045,3.5066,6.3332,2.2503,2.6031,4.2067,2.7484,4.1009,1.2001,3.1795,5.3395,1.0084,0.0575,0.009,0.0016,1.451,5.1702,2.1562,3.3863,3.846,0.7411,0.7102,2.2465,3.2132,1.6776,1.1809,2.5117,4.1613,0.0134,2.9181,0.2021,0.9544,2.3462,3.7756,4.7262,7.6176,2.2893,3.0463,3.2769,1.5137,4.4391,7.8676,1.6621,1.4225,0.5837,3.2103,0.0005,1.5097,7.4798,2.7683,1.8164,7.1141,0.0005,7.3196,3.1106,2.3635,4.4277,2.5595,0.7386,0.7129,4.616,1.0246,1.7849,4.418,0.0592,3.8787,3.5054,8.9073,0.3251,1.3257,6.0329,0.819,3.5051,2.6684,3.9601,8.1437,2.4215,5.4042,3.8042,2.69,0.0048,15.7568,6.4081,3.9863,13.8771,1.3823,7.0155,0.0505,2.0978,0.8446,5.9676,3.8295,3.2723,2.6659,0.0025,2.1584,2.6386,2.2464,3.8105,6.9937,1.8719,0.6868,2.3573,0.4011,3.4734,8.2308,1.9683,2.2466,1.5442,4.6964,3.9594,0.4453,1.5818,6.0445,2.7198,0.0597,0.7771,1.7097,1.1434,2.5065,5.1556,4.4298,0.0333,1.149,1.1925,0.4496,4.2242,4.6995,6.471,3.8866,4.6126,0.4967,1.9395,3.8082,2.0407,2.2215,5.2144,0.4966,4.8365,1.5512,0.7925,2.6029,2.7811,0.0017,2.076,1.3921,0.9421,2.045,3.7857,0.629,7.274,7.7073,0.6009,5.5189,2.9093,0.3325,7.5122,6.1518,6.6912,2.1281,6.732,2.2113,0.2268,1.6571,1.9552,3.6177,3.0923,3.2622,3.8685,6.5637,2.0486,1.6173,1.6556,0.9397,2.9763,2.0619,5.3948,2.7287,3.1999,2.6468,0.5515,3.4207,4.1932,0.759,2.9426,4.6381,0.3012,3.1356,2.8438,4.6721,1.4603,2.8409,4.3322,1.9731,4.8736,0.0808,5.0259,2.6339,4.6338,3.1409,2.2285,1.283,2.4321,6.2938,2.9535,2.8357,4.5831,1.3038,3.611,1.4372,1.7551,0.9672,2.0805,0.5974,4.1747,0.42,5.6913,1.3602,3.4784,2.4798,1.9565,4.7196,0.067,0.9676,1.9673,2.8128,0.0009,5.0224,3.9643,8.691,0.4641,0.6013,1.7409,1.1048,3.3916,7.7653,5.1037,0.0008,3.7889,5.5806,1.6596,1.9536,1.279,0.2325,0.3187,2.5631,0.7684,1.9832,3.2988,1.3119,0.4538,5.3475,0.6894,2.2599,5.0107,3.7925,2.3849,0.9039,0.0013,2.8017,0.6355,0.096,0.0002,1.5573,0.8832,4.6998,1.6108,3.1778,2.597,0.9329,2.2394,1.1207,7.3259,5.621,14.724,4.7236,5.568,3.1394,3.2874,0.1268,2.8901,0.7078,5.745,0.6114,8.2812,0.1583,3.8744,3.6394,0.3385,1.1445,3.611,2.2234,2.4711,1.8809,2.5744,2.6529,2.9169,2.3707,3.7006,6.3891,2.9697,2.7082,2.2422,2.9416,1.3757,0.3564,0.5326,0.7625,3.6149,1.078,1.7417,4.7911,0.4736,2.2468,4.6402,7.0411,2.9907,1.0189,3.2311,3.0867,4.1261,2.4897,0.073,0.3088,1.9799,2.4529,2.5936,5.4419,2.9127,2.988,9.0958,2.5046,1.8982,7.3651,2.5376,5.3274,2.9403,1.2585,4.93,2.8785,1.1637,1.1335,1.7274,1.2239,1.8209,0.2862,0.2194,1.5933,5.2364,2.9443,4.4515,1.0137,2.9918,1.2376,2.5354,3.3719,0.5267,0.053,0.1508,3.8657,6.9728,0.5281,5.4784,0.2385,4.2721,6.3213,0.0568,3.9584,5.02,5.1729,6.3587,1.5524,4.7342,6.6996,0.3801,3.2035,2.1825,0.0023,4.4816,0.3403,4.0219,6.3438,2.0373,2.3439,0.9993,3.9266,0.622,16.1023,3.1103,3.8427,4.3987,0.6083,2.9493,1.2059,6.1749,0.0569,1.01,2.1806,6.1742,1.1474,4.2686,3.6626,4.7806,0.9325,3.9097,5.3441,0.3167,4.4457,1.695,0.1552,5.4413,5.582,2.3711,0.8492,4.0416,2.6417,2.1082,1.5754,4.7756,7.0646,2.7488,0.1654,0.4395,0.392,2.7066,2.8988,0.8374,8.8802,5.1307,5.5088,6.229,0.5427,4.3898,1.5504,3.6305,3.5091,5.1383,1.9281,4.9534,5.464,2.9539,2.0208,0.9091,2.3954,1.8361,4.0124,1.4887,2.4802,4.0254,1.1534,4.043,3.4333,0.9079,2.5744,2.5716,5.2281,9.4273,1.2327,1.5607,0.1155,0.2945,4.8767,0.8783,3.3549,2.48,6.8092,4.6313,0.0006,1.4141,1.5083,3.2061,3.2283,2.119,4.8478,1.4651,2.2041,4.607,2.407,1.5432,3.953,0.8907,2.9262,3.826,0.9156,0.1396,0.252,0.7793,4.3759,2.7855,1.855,5.2664,2.6822,0.3978,2.5521,0.3146,1.9472,4.905,0.0109,2.4683,1.4156,1.0581,3.1672,0.4395]}
{"prompt":"All your life , you have been able to tell the name of a person 's soulmate just by looking at them . Your parents ' names do n't match . One day , you meet the man who is the soulmate of your father .","text":"All your life, you have been able to tell the name of a person's soulmate just by looking at them. Your parents'names don't match. One day, you meet the man who is the soulmate of your father. The two become in love but his family disapproves, and it is an even bigger problem in the future because your father's name is also the name of his family.\nYour life story is something. In that past, you will do it again. In you life with other persons, it will happen again. You know the soulmate very well and you can tell who is the one who has the right to be with you. All this happened before all this and it always happens because you know everything. You know what is going to happen and you choose to live the present and live your life. When you know that there is a destiny in your life, you're so comfortable.\nEverything in between is a gift. Every single problem that you have in your life happens because of love, money, and destiny and your destiny is so beautiful and has so much meaning. This means that you are alive. The past was not for a reason ; the present, what you're in the present, and your future, what you're about to experience. This means you are alive, so when you're in your spirituality, your body is so calm and at peace.\nI was a teenager when I first saw the movie and then, two years later, I wrote the book about it. The name of the movie is Spirit, which is so beautiful. Spirit is the energy that you have always known that is in your body, but you didn't know why you are alive. I wanted to tell this to people and if you have seen the movie, it tells you and shows you who you really are. Sometimes, the movie doesn't work like a book, but in the end, it works very well.\nI would like to remind you that no one can show you what you are feeling during the movie. The movie teaches you, through the story, but you have to experience it and know the different levels. This will take you a long time, but it will help you realize that these different levels are not in your head but you have to go there.\nThe movie has so many levels. It shows the different souls, how they are, how they are connected, how this is the reality, where the truth comes from, which is what you are, so you have to go there. It is not as abstract as we imagine in the movie. It is very real, but it is not all the same or it always looks the same way at your spirituality.","token_len":548,"entropy":[6.4831,5.2233,2.2086,2.8943,2.9697,2.9082,6.3195,0.0118,5.3972,2.1818,7.1472,0.1627,2.6077,2.9044,3.9392,5.227,5.0856,6.5755,0.4051,1.1107,0.1892,1.4745,0.7262,4.1045,5.351,3.2452,12.9972,4.6569,0.0004,4.4604,2.6562,6.5891,2.1803,1.1056,1.0265,4.6035,2.9213,2.7971,0.8468,2.9805,2.7375,4.801,0.1338,0.1948,1.2819,2.875,1.0747,2.7206,5.6265,4.7774,6.2573,0.7818,5.6575,4.9939,4.5948,7.2467,0.0171,2.7212,1.5214,4.3567,1.6009,5.3579,4.4782,1.7729,2.1178,4.0394,1.4154,1.6289,3.9518,2.3491,0.9964,2.231,1.4064,0.8579,4.5242,1.9922,1.4187,0.0796,3.0064,3.7959,0.5445,2.2992,8.3028,3.8973,5.0748,1.2844,5.632,6.255,4.3711,3.8036,6.6736,1.018,1.0799,4.9455,5.6066,5.0065,1.8127,0.7504,2.7553,6.7339,2.9282,6.2172,4.4696,6.3066,0.9696,3.6467,1.0495,3.5105,1.7782,0.2536,2.2022,4.3504,2.6789,6.2001,0.1648,7.3687,0.0259,2.3516,1.3741,2.8629,1.4944,3.6706,1.665,1.0275,4.0166,0.4952,2.5036,1.9308,3.8832,0.2904,2.0022,2.2848,0.4569,0.4646,5.3703,2.6022,3.6342,2.7506,6.5487,1.264,4.5417,2.2198,5.6498,1.4003,4.4777,1.6286,3.0346,5.4419,1.4313,2.0592,1.7721,2.6884,2.0654,2.5748,0.764,0.0578,2.5571,1.315,6.0223,0.9854,2.2845,3.6071,5.4391,2.6468,2.6724,4.1087,0.1482,1.6827,4.2592,0.5636,3.3775,2.3778,3.3276,0.4018,1.4142,7.0668,2.534,1.178,0.3496,0.5405,0.8145,6.3574,5.7917,5.3917,2.7959,1.3363,6.678,3.1919,6.6606,1.3539,2.5809,4.5872,0.7714,4.1232,3.1614,7.1247,2.3691,0.7804,1.3331,2.7607,0.4811,0.11,5.5913,1.4406,1.1796,5.6499,2.2908,6.0514,0.25,2.8822,6.5073,4.0195,3.6293,3.4082,0.7826,4.1538,3.285,1.9188,5.8116,1.4462,0.8838,1.9457,0.5747,4.1575,4.4663,0.5082,1.0663,2.0569,5.1013,1.6439,3.6362,4.5271,4.1358,2.7397,4.4974,4.8296,3.0125,10.5247,2.2844,1.3124,4.3569,5.0116,1.4451,4.0105,3.6475,3.0445,0.4527,1.072,3.9334,2.6325,1.2489,2.5464,3.1857,0.4837,0.7945,4.7813,0.3526,2.8155,1.339,3.2237,1.893,2.4162,1.4316,1.3671,2.5503,3.1295,4.3561,0.3325,2.6153,1.8066,2.161,11.2813,0.5634,3.0327,3.9117,1.0647,4.9424,5.6951,0.9011,6.1343,0.5093,0.8341,1.5928,3.1719,3.5914,3.0224,4.3269,1.209,0.5847,2.396,2.7576,1.3932,4.7079,4.1417,4.6242,4.1056,5.3402,0.3765,0.1941,0.0514,0.753,6.0182,2.1233,1.1348,3.0996,1.3011,0.4021,2.8713,5.3989,0.8847,0.7892,1.5326,1.1042,7.1128,3.0432,2.5731,0.8524,4.8592,1.0645,1.4022,3.8784,0.5395,1.5932,5.0446,1.3391,2.4017,1.6896,7.2269,3.5932,4.2471,2.6842,2.7546,0.828,1.798,1.7325,3.0863,1.8377,3.8625,0.0003,0.3242,5.5377,2.0748,3.617,3.5568,0.636,3.4854,3.8342,0.1224,2.2803,2.7593,3.172,2.2674,2.2678,5.5564,0.8986,2.892,4.7829,1.3579,0.2565,0.659,3.0213,4.434,0.289,5.6032,4.9957,0.4205,4.5782,0.6436,3.1972,0.0281,0.4571,6.4641,1.5696,2.8652,2.1175,2.867,0.0003,3.6401,4.582,3.7502,3.4264,1.4878,0.6829,3.6552,1.6256,1.6983,0.5189,1.1586,2.6471,4.4778,0.0926,0.5246,0.9878,2.1166,4.8002,1.0456,0.1628,5.7073,0.4079,0.6231,5.4462,1.5373,1.9857,5.9188,0.4605,2.6726,0.9493,1.6066,3.643,6.9573,1.4569,1.6142,0.6884,2.6688,1.4614,6.0942,0.1641,3.4657,4.8566,1.3519,3.9619,0.5979,3.9457,1.6026,2.234,0.2524,4.9059,0.5887,2.6138,3.5835,2.8647,6.2167,6.1063,2.0497,3.6929,4.3661,3.6023,1.1401,2.2099,0.5687,0.1102,1.9836,0.5663,1.6904,0.8886,2.8549,0.1411,4.1467,1.3449,5.9714,5.114,1.0888,0.7875,2.5405,4.5154,0.6394,3.1531,2.4762,2.4307,1.7816,0.2984,3.776,3.4924,0.9228,1.1477,2.5653,1.383,3.3586,3.0138,0.442,4.9981,1.2926,1.9379,3.1195,3.1722,2.3321,6.3971,2.0736,3.4096,0.926,1.673,2.9355,1.2674,0.3074,1.295,3.3226,1.5926,0.8508,6.3104,1.8401,2.5639,4.0423,2.23,4.0621,2.9867,3.7908,2.7755,0.2029,0.7678,4.6916,0.9296,2.8771,1.7545,1.4297,4.1785,4.04,1.2524,1.815,0.1113,1.5131,0.078,0.5139,2.5715,1.3428,2.59,4.3654,8.6072,0.3353,5.1036,3.7641,5.6734,1.0748,0.7921,0.8817,1.1912,0.6806,2.6099,1.7728,1.888,1.8662,0.9,0.7028,2.1463,4.6715,3.3588,1.0616,5.1305,4.0447,6.935,3.3311,2.3959,0.029,6.5093,5.8013,5.4221,11.214,0.4289]}

Have fun with this activity! The main thing is to write a story with an ongoing mystery the reader must solve.\nFor the next few weeks we will be learning about the different parts of a story. I will post the short story that I wrote below. To learn how to write your short story with no plot, just read the short story and follow the steps. You can either print the short story out, or use a word processing program like Word on your computer to download. As for the coloring page, you can click on the link below to view it on Google Drive.\nA man arrives in a small city by the sea. He is wearing a dark blue suit, black leather shoes, a dark blue tie, and a dark blue coat. He makes a point of wearing a black beard and black moustache.\nA man comes into a hotel room that is decorated in black. There is no bed in the room. The room is full of bookshelves and many small storage bins around the room. The man lies down on the side of a large round table that is placed on one of the storage bins. There is also a large mirror in the room that has an old photo displayed on it.\nThe man looks around the room, and smiles. He smiles because he has arrived in the city. He smiles because he is happy. He has done all his packing before he left. It has been many years since he has left his old hometown. The man has been thinking about his childhood in the old hometown, but it is not like he still feels like he is a child. His old friends are gone, all of them.\nThe man remembers the day he left the old hometown. It was rainy and cold, but there was hope for the future. When he left, he gave some money to his parents, and they wished him luck in his journey to the city. He remembered how he had stood on the sidewalk that day, in the rain, and hugged his parents very tight. He wished them all the happiness in the world.\nThe old man is listening to an old radio that has been placed on one of the bookshelves.

{"prompt":"Write me the cheesiest romance story you can .","text":"Write me the cheesiest romance story you can.-)\n\nThe writer\u2019s agent will not accept the manuscript if that is the case, even if he or she promises she will have it ready by the following year. This is because she will only be getting a book if she has more than one. The agent will also not allow a writer to know it is going to take years to complete the book. But she might have a hard time selling your book in the time it takes.\n\nA year passed. I looked over the manuscript again. There was no major work to be done. I\u2019d be more than happy to have it ready by the fall. Her agent had a great attitude about this, saying it wouldn\u2019t kill the writer to take the year and work out the kinks instead of rushing in and releasing a finished product.\n\nSo, if you want to be ready by the end of next year then make sure you are ready by the beginning of next year, and don\u2019t plan on needing to work on it after the deadline, otherwise you are asking the agent for too much.\nIf the manuscript is not ready in time, you might want to do something about it. You have two choices about this:\nChange the due date\nA year ago you asked for a one-year deadline for your book. That\u2019s fine, but you can change that deadline if you need to. Say to your agent, \u201cI know the manuscript isn\u2019t ready, but I am planning to submit it anyway. I would really like to try to make it in time for submission. I\u2019d like to change the deadline for the manuscript to fall before September 2010, but it\u2019s been three years since the original deadline.\u201d I don\u2019t know if agent and agent are going to be understanding about it, but you can ask and it might not matter. Your agent may not even let you change the deadline at all. Be prepared to move to an earlier deadline.\nLet the manuscript be ready for the next year.\nIf you are still stuck on the manuscript and you aren\u2019t ready to submit it to an agent, wait another year. Perhaps it will be ready by then. Your agent may have your manuscript ready when the deadline passes (although if it is, there is no reason to change it). I think you\u2019ll want to let the manuscript be finished next year.\nOf course I know the short answer is \u201cdo whatever\u2019s right for you\u201d.

{"prompt":"The Death Sentence is a literal sentence , spoken by a cult of executioners , that kills the person who hears it . You are the first known person to survive this fate .","text":"The Death Sentence is a literal sentence, spoken by a cult of executioners, that kills the person who hears it. You are the first known person to survive this fate. You enter The Death Sentence with a group of six other individuals. Every round you will listen as a list of names is read out. If you do not respond before each new list is read out, the list will end, and the person on that list will walk away unscathed.\nYou listen to the name list. There are ten lists on the sound track. There are three kinds of people in this game. The first has a red hair or mark. The second is a green hair and green marks. The third has purple hair and purple marks. If you do not respond to the list, the person on that name list walks away unscathed. At the end of the third list, you have heard that name four times as the first name in the list. You walk out.\nYou listen to the name list. This list has five names. There is a name on the list that has never been seen before. You walk out.\nYour group is standing in formation. The person at the front of your group gets a gun, ready to kill you or someone else. You have heard three of the five names of these individuals. Each of them wants to kill you, but you do not care if they do it. You have no desire to continue. One of the characters in your group was shot earlier. You and several other characters are surrounded by a wall of bullets. You cannot move, but you can stand up and walk a few feet away. You cannot change your position under this wall of bullets.\nAt this point you have no control over anything. You cannot move, attack, or make any effort to change your position. This character has already walked away. This is a literal execution. If you respond before the name on the fourth list is read out, you are alive, and walk away.\nThis is the ending score. It is possible to get a high score by surviving all ten rounds, but it is difficult to get a high score due to the slow pace of the game.\nWhat makes each session interesting is the challenge to survive all ten rounds. The soundtrack alone is a fascinating experience. The variety of voices that reads out the names on the list create an interesting mix of sounds. The voice acting is good and varied but not perfect. It is quite easy to distinguish the voice actors from each other. Some of the names that you hear on the lists are a bit hard to distinguish. However, that does not make the game uninteresting, and I imagine that some of the characters have some similar names.","token_len":551,"entropy":[9.1565,6.4541,0.1112,3.7521,1.8069,7.8406,4.2119,2.0545,7.2992,1.4975,1.4879,9.3553,2.8555,6.1944,0.0777,1.7188,2.5376,6.393,2.5145,2.1879,1.2069,8.622,0.558,0.5721,5.4614,2.9669,3.0058,4.4926,6.8621,0.9717,0.6341,4.2099,2.8692,4.3729,0.8897,2.2915,6.0068,5.288,0.9606,0.0542,0.0013,3.1518,1.5176,5.7001,0.0747,3.6767,3.6009,4.0403,1.7949,5.772,6.045,1.8587,3.7789,7.1358,3.4946,2.4104,6.284,0.1043,3.4954,1.353,2.3668,2.5845,1.1834,3.5185,0.6722,2.092,0.0788,3.6744,4.6248,4.0568,5.4125,1.7077,0.8569,0.7368,0.9088,0.2172,1.2604,3.3893,1.0778,4.1022,3.2822,0.7192,1.4524,2.5325,4.2793,2.712,0.0656,0.5906,6.7525,0.7076,4.8931,0.0002,0.2044,2.0113,7.2435,7.0784,0.9689,0.8322,4.6051,4.332,2.2594,4.438,0.7989,4.5342,4.8691,4.4465,0.9681,6.5214,3.1647,0.8826,3.8153,0.5038,2.4066,6.3322,0.0695,2.0919,2.6605,1.8617,3.2583,1.1273,1.38,0.8661,5.8816,1.722,7.0201,4.3841,3.9384,9.225,2.6254,0.4335,0.4694,2.5478,0.8083,4.6932,2.6565,4.4256,5.4122,1.981,0.4735,0.111,0.1112,2.3859,5.4835,2.2352,0.6423,1.6125,0.0705,0.0949,4.0396,0.5999,1.642,0.0323,0.7239,1.4147,0.831,1.3258,1.5055,0.7858,1.3284,0.2569,2.0233,7.6209,0.184,3.5133,0.0403,0.2056,0.0003,0.2414,5.1338,0.7406,0.1866,0.1152,1.1482,6.1762,0.21,0.457,1.1355,3.7311,4.4316,3.9467,1.9356,6.8867,0.281,5.0873,6.0373,2.3086,4.1532,3.7779,0.4356,0.2533,0.7944,1.948,3.8948,3.2588,3.2229,1.1984,1.3443,3.0125,0.1447,0.2936,1.5899,0.1755,0.2568,4.87,1.2376,2.6875,2.4053,1.182,0.8238,2.6019,1.9096,1.9524,5.0897,2.347,0.7269,2.8488,1.2014,2.2617,5.21,0.2152,3.8521,0.7801,0.4545,1.3865,1.6611,0.3239,0.6852,1.1289,3.7593,2.0269,2.0846,6.3833,1.5603,5.166,0.7999,1.8894,3.2199,5.214,0.1084,1.7997,0.7048,1.6988,0.1047,5.151,2.8523,6.1299,2.3828,6.8495,0.3493,3.8466,0.7534,5.4198,3.3633,0.6022,0.3031,1.539,3.8369,2.4365,5.2293,2.4993,0.7056,2.5928,0.1723,3.3957,4.604,3.402,0.9152,3.0272,1.0818,1.4875,5.9738,0.4454,0.6413,0.1833,1.7685,1.1655,1.2402,2.1956,0.0157,5.2456,3.2123,1.138,1.3162,3.5579,0.7607,1.3628,3.3268,3.041,4.598,0.0906,6.5022,1.9939,5.2841,0.382,0.6049,5.081,1.8013,0.6937,0.0156,6.2114,3.885,7.2807,1.508,1.3215,5.6704,5.1512,0.8858,1.7144,1.8463,5.2723,0.1802,2.2494,3.0774,0.7661,3.0291,0.5959,1.5716,5.2458,1.7303,1.9366,2.1673,0.7271,1.271,4.2719,1.8701,0.9508,2.3414,6.0764,0.9983,0.6386,1.1564,0.8486,1.461,4.7097,5.5429,1.1494,1.1618,7.7937,2.673,1.6376,1.1833,0.0452,0.4204,1.7772,3.7282,1.3592,0.2755,1.8893,2.4821,3.7925,5.058,0.3117,5.5897,0.9954,0.6861,2.4542,2.4873,1.1194,5.7806,0.3529,0.9851,4.8445,1.4837,6.5697,0.1015,3.1412,0.6793,0.2386,0.3727,3.659,4.7849,2.135,4.1979,3.9014,0.7996,1.5677,3.8834,1.7703,2.1206,5.1928,3.5319,1.2125,3.2152,0.2694,4.8348,3.1252,1.1658,4.1689,3.7289,0.4614,7.6767,0.1054,1.7711,0.1469,0.0575,0.1578,1.5962,2.0699,5.7232,2.4177,0.9263,7.2932,0.0548,2.5563,0.9838,3.6951,1.0665,1.6376,5.0947,7.3849,1.0888,3.4017,0.8324,4.8688,0.5981,3.0722,1.9418,4.7952,0.0863,2.9886,5.4694,3.9312,3.3496,2.9646,2.3682,0.894,1.7711,0.479,3.6597,0.883,0.5549,0.7184,0.9753,0.0281,5.9356,0.0043,0.8494,6.0435,1.4608,0.384,0.4823,0.1306,0.2049,1.5759,4.7064,3.9345,6.4609,7.2209,2.4353,0.4134,0.9262,5.3516,4.8002,3.3637,3.8462,0.8117,0.051,0.396,1.8607,7.538,5.959,1.036,2.6261,6.589,2.098,0.5469,1.4398,7.309,0.3506,2.9918,3.4887,12.0033,0.6112,2.2654,0.4645,2.9933,0.3359,1.9328,5.7691,1.853,1.9319,2.6587,0.7912,2.6993,1.0381,1.3666,4.6544,1.2739,0.9689,4.1193,1.8158,4.1435,4.6313,2.3168,3.7201,0.1649,3.0963,0.7632,4.9974,2.821,0.1042,6.3186,1.3441,2.906,1.7705,1.3418,2.3798,0.0436,0.8155,4.0186,0.7727,0.2512,4.114,2.6441,1.8636,0.4065,1.2648,0.1932,4.8225,0.7967,4.1973,1.2579,4.2563,0.0742,2.0264,1.3547,3.9972,0.1168,4.5648,2.1498,0.0296,3.4429,1.442,0.6661,3.6887,1.792,2.718,1.8121,2.8772,6.8004,1.1182,2.8938,0.4498,0.4469,2.9806,3.5058,2.6327,5.4854,3.0262,0.9262]}
{"prompt":"Ash has blotted out the skies for centuries . Now life on land has evolved to be similar to life in the abyssal depths of the ocean .","text":"Ash has blotted out the skies for centuries. Now life on land has evolved to be similar to life in the abyssal depths of the ocean. Life has emerged on the surface. It has become more powerful. More organized. More intelligent. It now sees other life forms in its environment. It has learnt how to respond and how to coexist. It has learnt how to adapt. It has discovered ways of exploiting life around it. It uses knowledge. It uses technology. Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes life has not evolved to allow it to work.\nIn the abyssal depths of the ocean it can be deadly. It also can be very complex. It is just the same on the surface but has been magnified and made more complex. Some think it has become a threat.\nIt has created a new challenge to many governments. As it has done for centuries, there has been controversy over whether human activity or natural phenomena is leading to the changes. In the 19th century, it was mostly natural phenomenon causing changes. It was very difficult to quantify but it was evident. In the 20th century, it was human action. It was easier to quantify. It became more common sense to think that human actions were leading to changes. However, the reality is that there are still problems.\nIn the year 2003 there is an international meeting in Montreal about the environment called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It produced a report. The report is extremely complex and not meant for laymen but for experts. I will try and summarise the report.\nThe report is really a record of a lot of research done by people all over the world. A huge amount of literature has been read. It is not like a football game report. It is not all about the goals and players and tactics. It is about how many of each player is on the pitch and how their skills are related to their ability to play, so it is a mass of data.\nThe report has been reviewed by a group of world leading scientists. They decided that they would like to come to a consensus. They know there are uncertainties and risks, but they don\u2019t know which ones. By coming to a consensus they can be sure they have got information from all the different angles and different points of view.\nIn the end it came to the conclusion there had been a warming of the planet. Many scientists are very skeptical. They didn\u2019t think it would have made such a big difference. Others think changes are actually happening that can be linked to this process. There are a lot of uncertainties still, but the report concludes that there is now a consensus that human activity is leading to changes that have an impact on the environment.","token_len":552,"entropy":[6.2347,9.8897,3.4345,0.3165,1.6308,8.4711,2.7996,6.1486,1.3062,4.4505,8.1325,2.5164,4.7323,2.3605,5.4034,1.571,2.8368,6.1739,0.2029,3.6533,1.7456,0.8612,9.3098,4.6324,1.4025,0.6129,0.7277,1.7635,0.5255,4.9772,2.1897,5.2608,3.0816,1.7866,2.1568,3.223,2.5121,1.4347,3.0406,3.9327,3.9731,1.5846,6.055,7.3853,0.7878,1.7032,3.1343,0.2504,2.1843,4.7632,5.3627,5.3781,1.1927,3.4384,2.6334,1.4934,4.7356,0.7835,1.0139,1.5403,5.9157,2.0599,0.0252,5.6831,3.8363,3.0797,0.0485,6.8577,0.7634,1.367,0.8778,0.7593,2.9504,0.6451,0.0265,3.2785,1.4398,0.637,0.4167,5.5807,2.2569,1.8101,5.9917,4.2983,4.8626,0.502,0.4139,0.6289,6.9035,5.5919,3.8222,0.4424,1.7225,2.7574,0.397,7.1856,4.7285,4.7196,0.2728,1.4529,0.8809,0.8494,4.1918,2.761,3.4811,2.3354,1.7982,5.2892,1.0153,0.3204,4.4496,1.2145,2.8171,8.3215,1.4333,5.7989,0.8483,0.2788,0.3486,0.1067,0.1897,4.2409,3.4071,2.0238,7.5048,0.4832,1.4204,6.8841,2.096,1.0311,2.9945,7.5138,0.2948,0.9996,1.5535,5.7605,3.0419,4.5559,5.1648,1.9842,0.2055,4.0909,5.2035,2.9206,7.6554,0.1339,2.2665,4.1718,1.639,0.8011,0.5038,5.3203,6.4487,1.1655,2.3773,2.5234,1.8106,6.2779,1.3546,3.4732,2.9327,1.6043,4.9758,1.2508,1.7869,7.7464,2.0852,5.588,6.9067,1.1498,5.4815,2.5318,1.584,2.6688,3.2046,2.5866,0.8846,4.2775,1.3138,0.1248,7.6787,1.2466,1.7814,5.4901,2.0376,4.5495,2.7484,3.1251,1.8084,6.201,0.1606,1.3603,5.8739,3.8759,3.5646,1.5447,6.2889,0.0026,0.1066,1.008,3.3531,0.4214,7.6638,4.9079,5.7013,7.5222,3.3876,1.2304,2.4161,0.9779,5.0241,2.1273,0.2644,5.0893,4.034,1.587,0.9123,5.5118,3.106,2.7783,0.748,1.1174,0.0049,0.0511,0.5074,0.8493,0.6999,5.7174,4.4962,0.9736,1.3089,0.6962,7.2498,0.1889,2.4317,1.6191,1.518,3.0926,1.6308,3.9428,9.1531,2.2043,3.5618,0.6449,2.683,3.3366,1.3817,3.4447,0.04,1.7549,0.5652,4.7765,0.1249,2.4682,3.8504,0.6827,0.4836,2.225,1.2003,3.8925,4.4204,1.2123,1.3176,2.6748,0.7564,7.0797,4.7865,2.8349,3.0077,2.2669,2.791,3.345,2.5771,5.642,3.83,1.0253,6.2413,6.2912,0.9852,3.393,0.1452,0.4089,0.042,0.0221,0.0009,0.8637,1.2535,8.4243,0.7005,0.2682,2.8983,1.9081,1.5818,2.0242,5.626,4.2179,1.3199,4.0094,6.6381,2.1047,4.9318,1.9052,2.5103,1.3593,5.5014,0.8728,4.0545,2.5046,2.6949,2.6211,4.0029,0.0046,1.689,2.1119,1.781,0.7256,1.3866,1.7141,1.4418,5.4073,1.6387,5.8743,0.2852,3.333,3.0769,0.0461,2.9591,2.3132,1.2685,3.0447,4.7973,0.2376,0.0299,0.042,0.6042,4.7089,4.4979,1.2409,0.1384,6.0145,1.5694,0.1172,5.4773,1.0993,1.459,0.7925,2.3684,4.7124,1.3879,8.2501,2.3394,4.6053,0.7973,0.6453,0.3318,1.6539,5.872,1.5744,1.852,6.641,2.2457,7.2027,2.8726,6.3229,0.8756,0.4425,0.1865,1.0166,2.5711,4.8129,2.9301,5.2607,3.586,2.3431,3.3066,0.5384,0.4452,1.4744,0.8241,4.2973,4.8749,1.4006,5.8156,0.1249,1.8843,4.4976,0.2802,1.7056,4.7122,4.5634,3.0441,0.7147,1.8658,9.3233,0.5643,1.6178,0.5612,1.3504,1.4637,1.693,3.057,1.5412,4.003,0.6532,1.7917,3.2252,0.2185,5.1866,5.0488,0.486,1.0899,1.7261,4.4319,0.8925,2.5219,1.9802,2.501,0.1425,5.1459,1.4346,1.6579,1.5532,1.6317,1.1395,6.4658,3.45,1.0461,5.4531,1.9343,5.8108,2.6837,0.8276,0.5621,3.668,17.5026,8.5,0.3139,3.0362,3.5464,2.1197,1.0143,7.5973,3.8526,0.1155,0.2775,0.123,1.6213,1.7587,3.813,1.8122,3.1411,2.3782,3.8895,6.3713,3.8068,2.7025,1.2194,2.9373,4.8714,2.3181,4.584,4.0592,0.28,0.0162,0.3614,0.9662,3.2222,1.0331,2.9608,2.3413,3.5387,0.759,1.9156,0.3808,6.7199,5.1275,1.0209,1.3992,5.113,0.8408,0.311,1.7282,1.5043,6.1677,1.3236,3.2911,3.3684,3.0883,1.3595,1.3499,6.1649,0.6961,0.4826,0.0072,2.7611,1.7201,1.8683,3.1872,4.1762,4.9203,0.1692,0.9622,0.17,0.5509,6.4437,1.7663,7.4161,1.6433,5.936,0.7642,4.4974,4.2303,1.5625,5.0448,0.1894,4.987,5.3985,0.4103,3.3727,1.1514,2.8477,0.3921,0.0218,2.061,7.6019,2.5986,0.7185,2.1863,2.8655,5.8563,0.4028,1.419,0.6773,4.0908,0.7926,3.9974,1.762,2.4258,0.5367,0.4344,3.0345,0.0177,1.3444,3.8365,2.4697,5.1108,0.7798,0.1857,0.661,1.8922,0.4871]}
{"prompt":"Using terrible analogies , write me a story about a private detectives first case .","text":"Using terrible analogies, write me a story about a private detectives first case.I promise to deliver it on Monday. I am waiting for your email.\nBeware\u2026 You don\u2019t even know what awaits you when you read this. I don\u2019t know if you live in the UK\u2026 but I do know you\u2019re going to freak out from the start!\nIf you did read on my blog earlier today then you may have seen (I think it has the word \u201cpoor\u201d written on the side) but I don\u2019t feel like being that shallow and pretentious and I thought I would share it with the whole world.\nWhat I had read left me feeling rather disillusioned and so I came to see it. First, let me just say these are my opinion and I will give my reason.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of horror films. There are a few out there which are really good, some that are just bad and most of them are just disappointing. But I thought this film was going to be special. Like, something that would\u2019ve made my night. Something to just get me giggling uncontrollably. Something that would totally kill me in a weird, dark, twisted way. Something to get me shaking and squirming around the cinema. I had an idea of what would happen and it was just going to be so good, it is quite a shame I failed to realise it. I\u2019ll admit, I just expected more.\nWe see a man in an all white suit come into a large building which appears to be the bank. We also see an older gent come out of a cubicle. I am told at the beginning we\u2019re going to see how old they are both. He takes off his jacket and pulls on a white shirt over his jacket. He then turns to leave and meets a man out in the street, it seems he\u2019s the same age as him, a few steps behind him, and they both wave hello to each other. This is when a blonde lady comes out of the building and stops to speak to them. The man quickly turns around to meet her, before that however he has a conversation with the office which we see through the peep hole or some similar thing. This is going to be really important later on.\nShe tells them that she came to change her money and this is how the film got its start. We all know who she is because I thought she was one of those \u201crich\u201d ones who come into the bank for a change of money on holidays and all that. Her name is Rosalind (a really terrible character name, I know).","token_len":552,"entropy":[11.0841,8.7032,0.7701,1.0216,9.7042,4.8526,1.2097,4.3442,1.3552,2.0309,7.8468,8.6135,7.6192,6.5142,1.752,7.7844,6.9198,1.64,5.919,1.6941,3.9892,4.7027,0.9964,2.5127,3.115,5.4913,0.9303,2.558,3.2075,0.8688,2.6535,9.4301,4.1438,7.4645,4.7522,3.3633,14.6862,7.753,0.6655,4.3144,0.8084,1.2963,9.4631,0.2254,2.5227,0.4186,3.1389,0.6424,0.9974,2.6893,3.5118,0.784,0.0859,0.0676,1.3766,2.6598,0.8151,5.8115,0.6294,1.5651,3.8106,5.0166,2.7161,1.2176,2.3679,0.1934,2.0788,3.6031,0.1932,3.1201,2.458,0.0855,6.767,0.6672,5.7759,1.6063,6.4508,4.1868,1.576,3.8482,0.2897,5.8201,3.9356,6.231,4.3372,1.0429,5.6905,2.3397,4.9883,0.6648,2.4797,0.5216,2.4052,6.4596,3.2583,3.4966,2.4362,3.6361,5.4316,3.9391,6.7888,5.5949,12.4656,1.2038,6.6288,4.0055,1.5238,2.683,2.6047,0.938,6.1429,1.3907,3.0796,0.5027,0.1641,0.0254,5.0178,1.5163,5.5591,4.848,8.4623,3.0319,6.8014,0.0061,3.1343,4.0185,5.91,1.382,1.1859,1.3966,2.188,1.1272,3.4354,4.5307,0.4174,0.7382,1.3399,3.93,1.089,5.3465,3.5909,8.5346,0.3133,2.5696,4.4569,5.5207,0.0029,1.4334,5.2234,0.7993,5.3948,1.7775,4.0545,2.9666,3.5647,5.4126,2.1244,4.028,0.2761,4.4994,0.5352,6.8026,1.2824,2.5681,5.4549,1.8982,1.2773,2.8443,4.2799,2.786,8.0543,2.4468,1.179,1.7122,3.7421,0.2635,1.5843,2.6766,2.3516,0.6124,0.0978,5.1769,2.5498,2.1071,3.8126,0.9841,2.3046,1.8916,5.3048,0.0158,3.4687,1.5804,3.6078,1.9515,2.0773,3.1821,3.1704,0.6346,2.509,3.3275,1.6415,4.7302,0.7983,0.4734,0.7446,2.6436,7.4885,0.6696,2.5529,1.5816,5.004,2.6622,3.8357,0.8959,3.2612,0.0247,0.521,6.4851,1.2683,6.0499,2.1448,5.8764,1.6521,3.2519,9.4631,0.8214,2.514,2.2483,2.9315,6.797,1.4647,5.1145,3.3416,6.5242,3.5663,3.2847,7.3509,0.1457,6.0875,0.0087,1.0957,3.0688,1.1151,0.7295,6.2044,4.6385,0.3582,3.6891,1.6297,5.0985,4.2684,3.9864,1.957,4.4013,0.0743,0.287,2.7476,2.0716,3.1193,0.4367,7.6029,1.8334,7.3554,0.2492,3.775,3.8121,5.4309,1.2584,2.512,3.743,5.0696,0.6707,1.8638,0.638,3.0334,0.7826,2.3866,2.1266,1.3499,2.4084,3.2495,0.0298,1.152,2.5715,2.9333,3.0993,2.4004,5.097,5.8273,2.7573,4.65,2.0191,5.2481,0.6304,3.842,0.9971,1.0834,2.2393,2.6571,0.1228,4.6289,5.1517,2.4563,0.6466,4.6562,6.897,3.2336,1.3743,0.9277,6.1255,4.2059,2.0034,4.0705,2.4318,3.3369,4.1878,2.2479,1.7336,5.5402,2.3745,1.491,5.0325,3.8823,4.6194,5.2659,0.2727,0.2578,2.94,9.1052,1.7376,3.8069,4.4464,0.2373,3.206,3.3024,8.8193,5.8097,1.988,0.7166,1.4631,6.2876,0.0299,2.319,2.9086,3.7081,3.7606,5.4171,1.0175,1.5375,6.2107,5.9147,0.4865,1.6386,0.4636,0.0187,1.1792,3.8771,5.8376,2.7716,0.239,6.9816,0.8232,3.3392,6.0533,1.1996,0.2247,3.0565,0.4685,4.3903,3.8393,1.1823,2.4602,2.0883,5.4731,0.3265,4.4272,1.0102,1.4214,4.0092,3.4973,1.501,4.166,1.5828,7.5135,1.8599,2.3563,5.8954,1.8094,0.2792,1.2808,2.9149,4.958,1.6616,1.8487,2.6167,0.1421,1.2685,3.1574,2.4011,3.058,0.2944,2.1063,2.2341,4.0427,4.8024,3.7833,1.8143,1.1844,2.4064,2.5218,3.4968,1.5745,7.3066,3.8037,1.7773,0.509,0.0183,0.5185,4.0403,0.8457,3.244,3.9686,6.1723,4.5503,1.2011,0.82,0.3237,0.6313,2.7039,0.9637,4.3493,2.4572,4.1855,0.4089,2.0643,0.2957,2.8791,2.4732,6.269,2.0066,1.1276,1.9508,2.9485,0.1919,2.1124,5.4372,6.8904,7.9426,1.8657,4.5494,1.5323,4.607,0.1738,1.6903,10.0727,5.7023,3.8774,2.3003,5.0697,1.0869,9.6527,0.2147,3.3542,6.9061,4.4419,5.3201,1.9783,0.4886,3.4346,0.9481,5.1972,0.0671,0.5642,3.2119,4.4481,4.5298,0.8857,0.9026,0.7884,4.0454,2.5823,2.5214,1.2343,0.796,4.6938,0.7114,6.5678,1.1067,6.4341,1.4924,5.2253,0.7343,3.345,3.1577,5.2963,3.8482,4.7483,1.7973,0.3903,3.3739,4.1739,0.4974,4.2285,1.1396,0.2394,3.8844,2.8884,5.1062,1.2121,0.5006,4.1515,0.0909,2.2631,7.7462,0.5435,5.4279,0.247,0.2496,6.203,1.3102,5.5494,3.3176,1.1575,2.509,3.8768,1.6066,2.3077,1.9346,2.5328,5.1084,5.0947,1.6446,5.5096,1.7783,0.9244,5.0105,1.3591,0.4019,5.8442,2.5556,1.2224,4.5304,4.5189,6.2357,5.9794,5.5024,3.1888,2.4771,1.7211,2.3436,2.1762]}

The Monster Under Your Bed Author. Tamar Herman\n- The Monster under your bed book \u00a9 2020\nBear River is an Alaska river and its name means \"stream of the bears\", referring to the numbers of bears that used to live along it. It flows northeastward for 75.8 miles (121.4 km) from Lake Superior, in what is now Canada, to the confluence of the Umiat and the Kasilof Rivers in the Kasilof Sound, about 11 miles (18 km) north of Homer.\nIt takes its name from the fact that bears used to live in the area where it flows through Alaska's Bitterroot Mountains and Lake Superior. Today, it is heavily used by recreational activities, such as fishing, hiking, and kayaking.\nThe river has a number of waterfalls and rapids along its length, and a narrow gorge is often used in the summer by kayakers. In addition, it is a source of recreation for boaters in the winter. Because of its lack of permanent population, it is considered a wilderness area.\nBears still frequently swim up the river, using it as a pathway to and from their homes along Lake Superior, which is only a few miles (5 km) upstream of the area where it was named. It has been reported that bears that survive the trip can survive the long winter, but their survival and reproductive success is questionable, and sometimes less than 1 percent of them make it.\nAlaska fishing vessels still take a number of fish, mainly rainbows and coho salmon, from the Bear River in the Bear Lake Commercial.","token_len":552,"entropy":[7.4262,4.5543,3.2104,7.5116,1.0283,2.319,4.8297,7.3004,1.2111,2.1658,1.5259,1.904,5.5593,1.9641,1.5217,0.0004,0.3466,0.1322,0.3563,1.9256,0.9231,5.7616,0.2398,0.0991,9.2334,0.4144,1.5614,1.3791,7.1415,3.358,5.9755,3.3887,3.0857,0.8029,5.811,3.0857,7.0603,4.5235,1.4463,2.0351,2.626,2.7463,4.8929,2.3626,3.5001,1.9122,1.7319,4.7602,0.8054,1.3574,0.3079,0.7511,4.8036,5.1942,2.6532,3.7557,3.8714,3.7573,4.7389,0.9812,0.0835,2.2452,4.6527,5.5061,4.8301,0.2279,0.0663,0.659,3.3694,4.9449,3.427,1.152,8.0833,0.0387,2.3636,3.7559,1.2644,2.1265,5.5174,4.2957,1.4218,4.1612,0.0053,3.6351,1.1657,4.5867,2.8053,3.9619,0.0124,6.5406,6.8918,0.7748,4.4207,0.9031,3.8596,0.9955,4.0053,0.0326,7.4098,1.9657,2.7704,0.2488,0.4094,0.6102,1.6168,1.8255,5.1507,4.704,6.0159,1.6258,1.7367,0.8428,4.2735,1.9581,1.6793,7.7951,0.8702,0.0217,0.5889,1.0944,7.1354,0.3396,4.2632,2.9381,2.7578,3.7149,5.3645,0.8063,1.2838,3.092,5.5025,1.7868,0.674,5.5111,3.2561,2.5712,7.1134,2.6464,2.3331,2.9472,0.9004,1.8349,1.4504,6.2979,0.0604,3.7354,3.1482,0.1177,2.361,0.6016,0.2927,2.4824,5.0656,4.1992,4.4641,6.9211,0.3441,9.0507,8.1086,6.4638,1.0792,2.0004,2.2213,2.918,3.118,2.0692,1.501,2.5159,1.0635,3.1144,0.4773,0.0671,0.7404,4.8742,1.59,7.0717,5.0211,0.7663,1.4616,4.8712,1.3636,3.9953,3.9944,7.4765,4.0564,1.8354,1.0151,4.6356,1.331,1.2398,0.2166,2.5333,1.9157,0.8492,6.8721,0.7353,3.6558,1.9577,0.3015,0.3071,2.1824,3.4418,6.1117,1.2579,1.4507,1.6124,1.5199,3.8562,0.5915,2.0626,0.8918,0.6508,7.1011,7.0051,5.351,2.0675,0.461,0.2944,0.0523,0.0129,0.9463,4.1589,2.7099,0.6741,1.4547,0.2401,0.4596,0.0345,0.0212,6.5411,1.9174,9.1767,2.8252,8.0061,3.9453,6.5588,4.0394,0.8587,2.9551,0.0484,0.0046,6.0884,5.6156,9.5285,3.824,9.923,5.8383,6.2995,2.1412,10.2611,9.1748,2.9019,2.6989,3.1156,2.0896,0.7656,9.3628,1.6854,2.4789,6.4482,3.0826,5.5317,0.0309,0.442,8.2557,1.0655,1.1378,1.4876,7.8353,0.6889,1.4364,4.1815,3.1241,0.4706,2.3133,4.2412,7.1108,3.4684,5.3742,7.1454,5.983,2.6481,0.3097,2.5366,5.7507,1.1514,2.3467,0.4237,0.2607,2.0655,3.9675,3.3146,2.4937,3.89,4.6517,0.2051,0.6701,5.1211,2.0041,1.6068,0.7784,8.9601,0.0012,0.0472,0.4587,11.7333,10.0432,3.3809,2.1079,10.4321,6.3239,6.4114,2.6943,2.1899,1.2714,11.3534,0.4547,0.0325,5.5733,2.1905,3.1582,4.8604,0.3608,0.8606,2.1947,0.084,0.0052,1.7934,0.2013,9.1044,1.4583,2.0049,3.3243,5.3049,3.6281,0.0145,0.054,0.5208,2.7726,0.0294,2.7966,5.4096,0.0866,0.7109,1.3659,0.7176,1.6336,3.0593,1.8519,0.9385,3.6264,3.063,2.2275,6.0372,6.4906,4.7018,2.0412,2.2674,4.8827,1.2983,0.638,5.9076,1.2225,2.2965,0.6008,7.2191,2.2534,1.289,4.6272,4.816,1.7369,1.8984,0.0011,2.659,0.7764,3.1296,0.4897,1.4975,2.9487,0.0085,0.3018,1.3686,1.7219,4.5977,3.0334,1.2329,3.3414,0.0011,5.2865,0.392,1.5602,6.7454,0.0012,3.1523,0.8875,1.9938,1.0213,1.9234,3.4049,5.2649,2.8915,4.3617,4.1492,1.7914,4.0071,1.653,2.8909,4.5635,3.7012,0.1298,1.3709,3.4392,2.8614,0.7341,1.7827,0.9988,1.8471,2.9793,0.0244,4.257,0.5504,6.1584,0.0116,3.7185,0.7537,4.0739,1.0022,6.0385,0.5197,0.6797,6.2348,0.0022,7.2284,5.4161,0.4105,1.3843,0.5107,2.6873,1.1145,4.342,0.6427,0.8644,0.9983,4.6089,2.502,6.5433,6.7852,4.2983,4.6363,1.3998,1.1556,1.2519,4.9629,3.2355,0.5361,0.2764,7.4343,0.82,4.894,0.1281,1.4806,1.7893,6.0184,4.7615,0.1942,1.785,2.7995,0.9585,4.7902,1.9984,0.6765,0.3393,0.6432,3.679,0.1124,0.0188,3.0051,1.0546,0.8543,4.816,1.0944,1.4854,2.7046,4.1333,0.3208,3.1411,2.906,1.2259,3.0333,0.2158,2.4335,5.4808,5.5752,1.8004,5.5959,3.0747,3.1985,3.0109,3.9749,2.7897,2.5414,2.1397,4.1821,3.1836,5.6071,6.7047,0.7596,1.6368,4.5093,2.7398,2.3652,5.4608,5.9019,0.3866,4.757,1.6512,0.4954,3.8531,4.196,0.0759,2.5916,0.82,6.4984,0.0992,7.5013,5.7619,5.9918,4.356,3.1453,3.8585,0.0109,3.5863,2.2339,4.6089,10.5578,1.1969,1.2223,7.3868,0.627,1.546,0.469,1.7564,0.3314,7.307,0.027,3.1379,1.1351,5.8579,5.3535,12.2341,5.4754]}

In a moment of clarity, you grab your iPhone, hold the home button, and speak your final words - the ones you've always heard in movies - to Siri : `` Tell my wife I love her. '' As your life ends, your wife receives a disturbing, confusing text : `` I love her ''. You wake up on another plane, to find the passengers having a quiet moment on the plane as soon as they land.\nWe all face loss. It may happen suddenly at a time when our lives may feel like they are on hold, when we may have to make some difficult and painful decisions. How do we handle a loss, and how do we move on? As a therapist, I can tell you that I know that it is not easy for me to move on after the loss of loved ones, after the death of a child. However, I must say, having an iPhone, with the ability in the last moments to send your loved one a text with a small message of love, helps us do so much more.\nThere are many ways to have your messages on your iPhone. It is also called a message app. There are many of them. We used to do this through a special messenger app. Now, there is an app from Apple, the Apple Messaging, which lets you access your messages through an app which acts as a messenger. Now, we can also send emails, a Facebook message, and a Tweet. We can also have a quick message to an app like the AirDrop. It is all possible now - but we should also not overlook the voice messaging.\nWe all can use voice messaging. In these days, you can have a voice call, for free, to call someone from your phone. They can even hear you. This is one of the ways that the Apple Messages allow you to send a text message and send it aloud. The person who reads your message, when they receive it, can hear your voice. This is also another way that I feel this messaging app is more personal.\nI have talked very little about that in this talk. If you do not use all the other options of messaging, your phone also features a very good voice messaging. You can send messages using the Siri Voice command. This is also a feature that a lot of Android phones lack. Siri can help you make those important decisions, when you do not know what to do and you lose your brain cells.\nI want to use this talk to show you this, and to show the value of having a phone that can help you, in the face of some moments in our lives that we would never have had, if we had a phone without this.","token_len":553,"entropy":[7.5992,8.3722,2.655,2.0633,2.1592,4.2898,6.615,1.2931,5.1499,2.7064,3.9044,1.2528,4.3091,0.414,1.1912,7.2752,0.9305,4.7245,1.4035,4.0642,2.6024,6.829,0.0277,1.2474,0.3419,6.1526,2.8598,4.3204,0.5485,6.0431,3.224,6.1918,1.0864,2.6169,2.2958,3.7849,3.4459,7.5298,2.7686,1.5447,7.2139,10.5953,8.542,9.559,4.3051,2.4195,1.8082,1.6695,1.7217,1.491,4.0242,5.8916,3.7484,5.1408,5.9021,0.1937,2.394,3.5422,6.4906,0.7811,8.7828,3.9219,5.9033,2.713,5.8529,0.2345,2.3374,1.2053,2.099,8.0717,8.7967,2.8498,5.6836,0.0944,4.1248,6.7481,3.0079,1.1082,5.3878,1.6892,3.1609,5.7676,5.362,1.9551,6.4178,3.053,4.1922,0.5215,1.826,5.2365,5.5356,0.0048,1.3621,2.7705,0.4858,4.8731,6.5713,2.9236,6.6839,6.0176,2.2578,3.1965,4.8645,4.6985,5.812,4.0913,2.4507,3.2224,1.2152,2.8514,1.1477,4.1809,4.9794,2.1726,1.3893,1.4975,2.1891,4.3556,1.6558,3.422,1.0879,2.0545,2.4875,1.4472,3.2173,3.5877,2.6652,6.2968,2.1574,0.6328,1.1563,5.718,1.6254,0.4824,4.3819,4.2523,0.5721,2.5379,1.6396,0.8918,0.4491,0.0268,3.8688,1.3647,1.0473,4.8186,1.8801,3.7642,0.3545,0.5532,3.1132,1.887,0.0918,0.9136,3.9794,3.1091,2.0649,3.0845,0.8759,2.218,1.1746,2.6894,3.1148,0.1698,3.4892,0.7103,4.2893,3.3614,0.6426,1.5183,3.6848,0.1288,1.7199,5.2624,1.2665,3.4355,0.0553,1.1844,4.16,1.3542,4.4895,0.0575,0.9586,4.5923,2.805,1.8959,5.8833,4.8824,6.2565,2.6289,4.2364,2.1312,1.4421,8.4944,2.3546,4.2751,3.8981,0.5804,4.7059,3.4062,3.2678,1.3622,1.3925,1.376,3.8045,1.5918,5.7654,1.9688,3.9206,2.499,0.9892,5.3822,2.692,4.5147,1.6276,2.2718,1.1801,0.7714,1.9012,4.287,0.6627,1.1478,1.7184,0.629,5.6285,2.28,5.5697,3.8829,0.6818,1.3231,0.7522,3.555,0.8427,3.9428,6.062,1.1441,3.9432,2.4556,0.604,3.4757,0.2494,1.0593,5.5183,0.6104,1.1766,3.6683,5.644,0.3569,4.1886,2.0313,5.6323,2.9264,5.8492,7.582,0.6128,3.148,2.801,1.1153,2.4075,1.2993,2.6774,0.6819,6.0562,1.7624,2.4379,4.9168,3.1399,6.4043,0.0156,4.5118,1.4558,3.231,0.2624,6.0977,1.1548,0.9736,2.2481,3.2576,0.6323,5.2473,6.0703,0.4645,0.604,2.3174,1.1776,4.5455,0.3659,2.8579,2.3853,2.9038,1.989,4.4298,2.2836,5.7847,4.6621,1.3881,0.3125,1.7835,1.2787,5.5554,1.1831,2.1335,1.1804,1.2873,3.9511,1.5406,6.1133,2.082,2.4889,4.7843,3.4274,2.4924,4.0054,6.6262,0.5576,2.1483,3.0915,0.8508,3.9245,3.7926,3.4933,4.1679,3.486,2.429,4.8821,2.7022,4.2692,4.6506,0.5585,7.0372,3.8742,2.3195,1.4099,2.7242,2.5756,4.6063,2.5529,1.2944,1.3096,1.4121,3.47,6.5338,2.3363,1.174,3.3348,0.7997,2.9717,1.3933,2.2582,3.9036,1.8974,4.914,5.0158,0.9667,2.5286,4.407,2.188,3.2893,0.9307,1.5312,0.746,5.9345,1.2382,3.9501,4.3124,0.4672,1.0735,3.278,0.6461,3.8598,0.3626,0.1214,3.3352,1.4909,3.4359,4.0086,3.0755,6.6378,1.1373,0.0812,2.5719,1.907,2.7142,1.2731,3.3687,2.0667,0.976,8.8739,0.7883,2.7752,5.1168,1.5701,4.806,1.0606,0.5107,2.4159,4.3752,1.0696,3.4078,0.1979,0.1931,1.5681,1.7405,2.1777,0.8013,1.0551,2.2627,0.7432,3.0125,3.0956,0.4344,0.6552,4.1649,4.4487,4.7636,5.6984,2.3136,1.1089,3.0311,4.9396,1.3668,1.5952,2.4537,2.2559,5.4054,6.9316,2.9788,0.1418,5.7581,3.8588,1.6203,4.2137,0.7416,4.5287,0.6396,3.971,1.7747,5.4044,6.3303,1.1472,3.3608,2.7151,3.3208,3.5436,0.7641,4.1421,2.0638,6.9822,7.4816,1.483,3.8615,4.6021,1.8395,3.9982,2.701,2.6831,0.4422,2.4047,2.3078,3.3506,1.9188,5.0238,4.201,5.7959,1.1308,2.6823,0.8476,3.1322,1.7224,3.6327,1.0375,5.0893,0.5203,0.0231,5.7203,1.3162,5.2181,0.4089,5.3923,2.6584,3.7669,0.1438,4.0589,5.4705,5.0342,0.5877,1.9656,4.4831,0.6174,3.1792,0.1923,2.2061,1.1836,0.8389,0.2781,3.3873,3.296,6.4205,1.0063,7.4366,4.6246,0.3957,1.1709,2.1708,3.5216,0.2996,4.7839,1.9374,4.7202,1.1463,3.2957,0.4771,4.8133,3.734,2.0917,1.6679,1.3287,4.0241,4.1992,0.3786,3.3641,0.969,3.1592,1.2292,1.4244,2.9248,0.1861,4.1079,3.4163,1.8601,3.7774,0.0061,4.9862,8.0272,4.2286,4.6814,0.0874,2.0,2.1493,4.184,2.0971,1.3812,2.8578,2.9736,1.3719,0.6306,0.749,3.0312,1.2501,5.4975,3.3468,2.7485]}

{"prompt":"Everyone is born with the last words they will ever say tattooed on their chest","text":"Everyone is born with the last words they will ever say tattooed on their chest. But I am a man that\u2019s never regretted the bad words, the wrong thoughts, or the hurt I may have caused others. I\u2019ve always been a very honest person so those wounds are just there on my heart. I don\u2019t need a tattoo on my body to remind me or my future self of that. That is for you to live, feel, and remember. The ones with a purpose to keep you alive and make you better are the ones you will remember. I look to those marks in my chest and think about the ones I wished were on my body.\nNo matter where you are, where I am or what is happening right now, I would not change a single thing from where my life has taken me. I can\u2019t change the experiences of the past but I can choose from the ones I\u2019m given. It\u2019s up to me to make them count for something, not let them go on and on and on.\nI don\u2019t live for the pain but it\u2019s all there to remind me of what I have experienced and what I will experience in the future. I would rather focus on what I have gained and on whom I\u2019ve grown than what I have left behind.\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who has felt this way throughout their life as my words reveal. My words don\u2019t seem to come out the way I planned them to. It all makes sense to say the things I know will seem cliche and corny but that\u2019s exactly who I am.\nIf I could be anybody, I\u2019d be Marilyn Monroe because she was fun and a star but not shallow or insincere. She had a heart full of love and kindness. She made the best of herself from a bad situation but she also learned from it. She always took the brunt of what happened to her but she never stopped loving herself. I think she is one of the most beautiful women who lived through a war and a life filled with tragedy but her beauty and spirit stayed strong throughout it all. A real inspiration for anyone who has ever found themselves falling through a hole and not knowing what to do with themselves!\nAs far as the future is concerned, I would like to become a successful painter so I could continue to express myself, my beliefs, and my dreams through my art.

He has a short stay due to a leg injury, his return home to his small town is delayed, along with numerous other young men. It is a time when things are not easily explained.\nI have seen a lot of videos since the beginning of the year. But when I say I have seen some of the best videos, few are in my video list. It doesn't matter if it's a famous or a non famous video, it has to be really good. I believe we have a choice on the web and we can choose what we want watching.

You see all of that in one video!\nThis is a short film that has been circulating in the web for a while now ( it has been online since 2005 probably ), but I was just recently introduced to it. I was just watching a movie, but the sound was weird and then there was an accident with the film. So I stopped watching and started looking for solutions to fix the problem.

{"prompt":"You 're a wizard but unemployment rate is now quite high in the wizarding world and so you try your luck at getting a job in the muggle world . You 're now in the interview and have to describe your education\/job experience .","text":"You're a wizard but unemployment rate is now quite high in the wizarding world and so you try your luck at getting a job in the muggle world. You're now in the interview and have to describe your education\/job experience. The interviewer says:\nHarry, what is your position in the wizarding world? As the head of wizard and wizard school. This is a very nice job. My wife is not working. You do not have children?\nHarry's job is interesting, but what about the rest of the staff at Hogwarts? They seem happier with their lives than you. How happy are you? Are you happy?\nHarry's job has been wonderful and I really enjoy the job I'm doing as head of all the Hogwarts staff. I find I'm very busy and enjoying my job.\nHarry can I please get you to fill in my application? What was your childhood upbringing. Tell me your educational background. What's the school you go to? Are you happy in your job. How happy are you?\nThank you for coming to my interview. I have taken that job. I will make another interview at another job I have applied to.\nThe above examples involve a description of the present life and a statement of what the narrateur is trying to achieve in his life, even if that achievement is in some way inconsistent with the real-life situation. The point of such an essay is certainly not to argue for the narrateur's happiness, but to show the reader the different character he is in the narrated and in the real-life situation. The narrator is trying to change himself from being someone in the real world to someone in the story, a character in his stories, and the change is often done through dramatic monologues, or monologue of the narrator.\nThere is no doubt that the most common literary essay is a personal narrative essay. An essay in this category discusses the life, career, thoughts, and experiences of a known person, or one who has significant impact on the writer's personal life. The literary narrative also discusses the life experiences of the writer through their own words and through the writer's eyes, but the point here is different. Usually, in the real life situation, the writer is not really the main character. In the story, on the other hand, the writer is one of the main characters. Even if the main character is not there, he can be written in the story with his or her thoughts, personal experiences, and views.\nA common requirement, but not always an absolute requirement, of the literary essay is a comparison or contrast. Literary comparison essays are usually descriptive, narrative, or expository essays that include many similarities and differences between two or more people or situations.","token_len":555,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,6.7228,5.4357,14.1894,5.1684,0.554,5.0564,6.4782,0.496,3.8632,1.8043,8.0113,0.9135,0.1251,2.8656,4.0373,1.5118,5.6855,3.9761,3.9608,2.1145,3.6335,1.4285,0.2581,3.0131,1.0248,7.4779,0.0226,0.2459,0.9112,1.9302,2.014,6.1589,2.9269,1.3901,10.137,3.4695,3.8975,1.3157,7.8227,1.1972,5.1491,6.2538,1.9814,2.6437,1.1284,3.3792,2.7954,3.035,2.6786,2.3546,10.4052,1.7657,2.537,2.2975,0.2862,5.8844,1.1671,0.6945,1.018,0.0065,0.101,0.3693,6.7211,3.3078,3.0256,0.2914,4.7839,7.0084,3.4114,7.4316,3.9708,5.6756,0.8551,1.8946,1.9019,4.5453,0.972,1.4826,5.0304,4.4668,1.8805,4.1442,4.3223,1.9518,3.0132,4.2653,0.9989,1.0267,5.969,4.5435,2.9749,1.8333,3.4788,4.3678,1.6542,5.5264,2.0097,0.9488,4.0598,1.9044,1.3405,3.6937,0.0813,0.6622,3.3714,2.7233,0.472,0.3419,3.1979,4.3823,8.3618,2.8179,1.2158,2.7239,1.8006,3.017,1.7614,3.1744,4.7612,0.8028,0.8018,0.7694,3.7551,0.3543,1.5023,2.3487,1.1405,2.1574,1.5969,0.7402,3.5117,1.7568,5.5122,2.7158,2.7212,4.1523,2.1732,2.7009,1.5201,3.3213,1.7342,0.5043,3.45,3.6089,0.5697,6.1423,1.3085,2.185,1.0428,0.333,1.484,4.4522,5.0726,1.6012,2.9541,5.1687,1.31,8.1429,1.4514,1.4828,1.1883,1.5282,2.137,4.3517,9.6771,5.5234,3.3426,2.781,2.8599,5.5718,1.9798,3.8601,3.1867,0.961,4.8327,5.1519,0.4737,7.1398,6.3801,6.6397,5.5912,0.3551,4.0707,5.8355,0.1227,0.6797,1.8201,3.5861,2.3235,3.5663,1.1063,4.9283,0.019,0.7927,3.7393,0.3468,6.0831,2.2558,1.3846,3.0597,3.2947,2.8007,0.8724,0.3557,0.0152,0.4674,0.7099,5.7076,0.0482,1.4313,4.5035,1.3012,2.4797,2.4833,0.4089,1.3083,3.5053,5.1749,5.4772,1.6167,3.1415,1.4832,3.8692,4.179,6.6975,2.2801,3.5609,4.5354,3.8826,2.6707,2.0606,6.2447,1.4992,0.5107,1.4167,4.0431,6.3937,5.3813,7.5232,2.0821,7.6609,0.2003,1.7015,7.9353,3.7341,1.9295,2.4681,4.9415,0.7249,2.5134,2.7996,14.1654,9.7137,2.4727,2.0935,0.0156,2.288,2.3012,1.2848,2.9913,3.4599,5.7105,0.6579,3.1962,8.0393,0.7045,3.7418,3.2039,0.8552,6.8413,0.3486,1.1545,4.5062,3.7023,0.2045,2.1833,0.6835,2.2687,5.4845,1.9351,4.2386,1.1793,5.0259,0.1813,7.6126,1.2993,0.2507,4.7052,2.6235,1.6954,3.9658,0.1183,0.3922,5.5239,1.0871,0.426,1.4232,2.6553,2.3552,2.5878,2.5128,4.96,5.6578,6.6602,1.2902,2.9095,1.9875,7.0982,4.6784,4.164,0.6667,0.8119,1.5868,0.0707,1.218,0.5382,2.4061,2.1276,1.1404,1.3282,0.0673,4.9031,4.4082,2.2237,2.8015,4.6448,4.1742,1.1044,1.9636,0.631,0.532,1.1492,0.6721,0.3621,7.0375,1.9995,4.2874,2.5058,2.031,2.9525,7.7535,1.4445,1.7379,2.7134,8.0358,1.1484,5.0018,4.8874,2.1534,5.2809,8.687,0.1511,0.0348,2.0285,3.0385,6.1659,2.7754,5.3596,1.9004,1.13,1.0561,1.0088,3.8563,1.166,1.883,3.394,0.4052,1.225,6.4395,3.8083,6.516,6.9511,2.1382,2.3407,6.2276,4.8767,4.3404,1.1291,4.6634,0.8585,3.4036,1.9182,4.7142,8.6082,1.0654,2.9453,2.7201,2.8833,0.1949,6.9534,0.2935,1.1148,2.2905,0.1035,0.9292,8.3979,1.1887,1.6372,2.5688,4.3416,1.2517,1.1149,6.9063,5.4018,0.2577,1.0089,4.4683,0.8051,4.0661,0.424,0.5718,1.9559,4.993,4.1748,5.3675,4.0898,0.8075,2.152,4.1082,0.284,2.0028,2.3843,4.9974,4.3774,2.351,3.8435,1.2114,5.0638,1.5188,4.9499,0.0341,5.5245,1.9965,4.2271,1.9839,5.3891,3.2059,0.0733,6.5072,0.4961,7.6869,1.3521,4.1242,1.7476,4.3581,2.2975,2.4408,0.4217,0.642,1.1499,1.6431,2.8566,4.8727,2.4883,3.7099,0.2942,2.0172,2.0122,0.7997,4.2183,0.2083,6.6624,0.1362,0.0814,0.0015,0.0056,0.4377,1.5109,0.8091,4.7165,0.7345,0.2729,0.8295,0.0423,0.9561,5.6925,1.2674,0.4931,3.1128,0.1206,0.7731,1.4974,5.0681,0.4619,2.5282,3.1423,1.673,6.3011,2.4712,1.5206,1.9741,4.6091,2.3689,4.6339,0.0076,4.1989,1.1858,6.5517,1.4496,0.0618,0.6186,5.9112,0.857,0.9571,3.0502,3.7659,9.2477,4.8779,5.4841,1.1051,2.1436,3.9467,2.624,0.6705,0.1757,2.5143,2.259,1.0552,3.0074,0.2455,2.9494,7.2949,4.2638,4.2218,2.1321,7.9742,3.2501,6.6089,0.9883,2.1303,6.5968,1.8961,7.3469,0.5695,0.8825,7.1068,0.138,2.1065,2.3796,4.9526,3.7964,6.1937,1.532,0.6114,0.9097,3.9796,1.325,0.0475,1.8692,2.796,2.745,0.3852]}
{"prompt":"You 've just died and gone to bureaucratic hell . Escape is possible , but really , really tedious . You and some other lost souls have decided to try .","text":"You've just died and gone to bureaucratic hell. Escape is possible, but really, really tedious. You and some other lost souls have decided to try. No idea where you're going. When you wake up, it might have been an afternoon. Who were these guys and why do they're here is not the important part. What is the important is that you're here, you're alive.\nOn a side note, as a fellow modder, it's kinda fun when it's your idea and others take it further. Hopefully, they'll take it further than I have. Oh, and you should probably put this on your index page. I might try this out, but as I said before, I have no time.\nOne interesting point of the game is that the game in itself is a very easy to learn game while there is a large amount of ways to do things within it.\nThe game is designed in such a way that it is easy to be caught in a web of traps and the only way to escape is to be smart and know how to avoid getting it. It could be the most effective escape games.\nI have played it for over a month but I could not pass the first stage of the game. The difficulty level is extremely high and very simple solutions that can avoid the traps are not easily found.\nOne would think to say that the game should ask you for the exact values or ranges and such then it should be easy enough to solve any puzzle but it is obviously not. The puzzles are very difficult as there can be an infinite number of configurations of the system.\nHowever the game has really good design and great story and the gameplay itself is really good and there is not much of something to complain of. I also found it quite addicting and would recommend it to anyone looking for a puzzle game that is fun.\nA big plus though is the graphics and the sound are great and it is quite different from the normal escape games and if you like the old school style of escape games or were a fan of old school games but haven\u2019t played a game like that for a long long time The escape game is really well made for anyone who likes escape room type games.\nI have to say that this game was a ton of fun, and the ending was pretty unexpected. The game is a bit difficult, but with time, you\u2019re going to get the hang of it. Overall, I have a feeling that the game will get better and better, and I look forward to future updates.\nThis game has a real challenge that makes it worthwhile (not too much though, you could probably do it without any help). The setting is very unique, which makes the whole experience very relaxing.","token_len":556,"entropy":[5.5189,3.6413,7.0519,2.8416,4.3818,1.3117,14.1115,1.0288,1.2229,10.7884,2.4593,4.4393,1.5376,0.7279,7.3464,1.3671,6.0608,8.1374,0.5629,2.6517,7.37,5.365,1.4813,7.7152,2.1471,2.2802,5.0683,0.7041,3.4516,4.2337,5.2763,5.4912,2.5517,1.0571,1.551,0.2706,1.0119,5.5849,0.4581,3.9894,0.107,0.6481,2.953,4.583,3.9631,0.6539,4.2868,4.3218,2.4558,5.6208,5.0216,4.1283,3.126,3.626,2.0016,3.0885,0.8327,5.7629,0.8814,9.4548,3.5187,4.5146,4.915,2.9399,0.7741,3.6438,2.362,2.1275,3.1067,7.1027,1.0329,0.6242,1.9327,2.8712,1.5936,2.2772,0.9326,2.494,1.2184,2.295,9.8807,2.6129,3.4956,0.0076,0.2537,4.6509,2.0704,4.9368,7.2154,5.2879,0.8825,3.6202,1.1601,5.3332,3.3936,3.7134,4.6526,1.0245,3.0583,6.4584,3.3958,6.0786,4.0996,1.0261,5.497,0.6504,6.2255,1.9887,4.2571,1.2316,3.2046,0.7623,1.3162,3.5794,1.6848,2.7456,0.5655,6.2968,0.4392,0.2807,3.8299,2.8929,1.9072,4.8534,2.692,2.0815,1.4404,7.5434,2.7361,1.4169,2.4572,5.0473,4.3472,3.4514,1.8412,2.6862,1.9117,4.6973,2.2586,0.8244,2.2192,0.1402,1.282,3.5096,1.0728,4.7232,2.509,1.2892,5.1505,6.5284,3.0306,3.4761,3.1916,1.997,0.7621,0.7917,2.388,3.0144,6.69,3.3045,0.6754,1.9028,3.0852,5.0521,1.6856,2.1285,0.9086,7.0616,5.1251,1.7503,1.2079,3.8643,1.5531,0.0658,8.1191,0.3681,2.4171,2.3464,5.771,0.7697,0.2181,3.7384,2.7224,2.3787,1.5158,3.848,2.9975,1.1051,0.0389,0.051,0.1562,1.7748,2.05,1.6157,0.1969,4.7485,4.9587,2.8502,1.4321,4.4316,0.2306,3.6033,1.1272,4.8218,4.5826,0.5712,0.336,1.5031,0.375,0.6412,3.8587,6.0792,1.3789,3.8552,1.5323,0.1074,3.0045,4.5927,8.011,1.7057,2.7522,5.2158,0.4791,3.9967,3.4188,4.7688,4.2666,7.4779,3.6827,1.1032,2.4633,3.2426,4.0724,3.0909,2.0213,3.188,1.1589,2.3282,4.6432,1.2375,4.9838,1.2272,5.3877,2.4833,2.2989,5.8099,2.1008,1.0237,0.679,1.1124,2.3872,5.1289,2.9015,1.1146,3.537,1.4774,1.1233,4.7718,4.645,10.3929,4.1029,2.7874,6.9921,2.1131,1.83,1.3922,2.3635,5.6284,1.8402,0.404,1.569,3.7754,6.4388,0.9172,5.7957,6.4712,0.616,1.6119,0.9607,3.4461,8.4067,0.8202,2.738,3.0563,4.573,6.4246,4.5488,7.481,3.8552,6.3355,5.8564,3.0498,2.3825,1.4703,2.3636,2.2872,0.1874,3.7627,4.993,3.6306,4.1668,2.2617,1.6233,6.6701,0.5222,0.5114,2.3629,4.2007,0.9561,2.5265,2.1185,3.7893,2.7209,5.4557,0.2221,4.8293,0.6618,0.2919,0.0307,8.2027,2.2028,1.7641,4.7961,1.0136,1.0334,4.8043,3.8312,1.1302,2.6149,5.6212,1.92,3.4816,1.3404,5.5811,3.4913,2.3715,2.6846,4.1326,4.1034,0.4088,2.6336,1.7475,2.9486,4.2544,0.8819,3.8372,0.7802,2.6017,6.1853,1.8062,3.4998,6.1331,0.4344,2.4584,4.1719,2.7345,1.7261,2.8873,5.9093,0.0268,1.7239,5.3909,1.1339,0.5133,0.5121,0.5803,2.8502,0.4266,0.6942,4.3869,0.3746,2.5728,1.7383,3.2589,2.5238,0.598,4.0792,3.8576,3.0917,4.3817,0.4225,1.5262,5.2163,1.7892,1.2467,3.6828,4.0101,2.3331,1.7544,2.8659,1.4085,3.1106,5.1326,0.7081,1.342,4.7972,9.8726,0.2993,3.6158,4.3932,0.2861,2.2962,1.8256,4.7073,3.0692,3.1492,1.2996,3.8491,0.2846,4.6004,6.4791,2.4558,1.7261,0.0419,3.4019,0.3108,1.5994,4.6442,4.1304,17.074,7.5297,0.8192,1.7138,2.9513,1.7035,0.5899,2.8642,3.3659,1.0718,0.8824,5.7119,0.1044,10.3451,6.5777,0.9064,0.8731,2.8626,3.1929,1.9884,5.1621,5.1928,0.9959,1.3363,5.775,11.3491,5.0862,0.4283,1.0486,0.8322,2.2393,2.6882,2.6747,0.5182,0.903,2.629,0.6744,2.7338,1.9828,7.1828,0.1279,0.0238,3.5914,2.8981,3.0134,5.1999,1.2605,2.8915,6.2735,0.6971,2.013,1.6958,1.8391,2.4842,1.9626,3.3782,2.7227,0.7374,4.8868,5.0437,2.4329,1.6227,15.3163,0.6657,3.1428,1.4739,0.007,1.5182,3.8031,1.6084,0.0109,0.1866,0.3889,5.6377,0.8968,1.2091,3.8397,2.4676,2.7556,0.3367,1.9683,0.8581,0.8231,3.2511,0.9853,1.3223,1.0624,2.9821,1.2526,1.375,5.0254,0.0016,0.0067,6.4426,1.4611,0.8004,0.6875,3.7035,1.6295,2.2763,1.6836,6.2177,3.8509,3.4745,4.4841,0.366,5.8442,7.1178,3.9731,4.1621,1.721,4.1507,1.8257,4.0438,3.9329,3.1246,2.218,1.9643,2.8713,2.944,3.1496,1.8117,2.27,6.6712,0.6709,1.7607,2.9169,1.8806,4.0067,1.7691,1.8239,4.1305,1.2747,2.3776,4.1283,0.7767]}
{"prompt":"world leaders are no longer elected . An advanced algorithm sorts through everyones social media posts , emails , phone calls etc and selects the best candidate .

An advanced algorithm sorts through everyones social media posts, emails, phone calls etc and selects the best candidate. It's chosen `` Big dave '' the truck driver. Big dave says he can keep the politicians in check. He shows that if everyone in America is registered to vote he can beat out even Hillary Clinton & John McCain for the presidency\nIn another experiment, in some towns in Finland where police are outnumbered by criminals, a group of volunteers with automatic weapons (AK47s) are given the order to shoot down the robbers. Over night, those same towns become a crime free zone.\nIn a previous experiment, when police started to give chase to criminals, they were able to locate and catch them but once they started to flee the criminals, they usually left behind evidence which would make the police suspect that they were fleeing, they would then give up their pursuit. The volunteers are given instructions so that if they see a suspect being chased by civilians they shoot it down\nHow is this possible? The answer is through an advanced algorithm that has been developed. They look at the speed of the vehicle it's likely that it s a police vehicle. They check the license plate and the plate will normally have a number that starts with a letter of the alphabet. The police vehicle will usually be going pretty fast, the criminals will not be. They check the license plate against registered data like the state and the type of license plates, and even sometimes the address. When the car has already been caught by the police and they are fleeing, they will slow down. They are able to locate the suspect and catch them by accident\nIn some of the trials done, police have used helicopters to help get the criminals, and they have started running them down, but once again by mistake they caught the wrong car and ended up killing innocent bystanders\nIn another similar program, the police were looking for a child who was being kidnapped from his home town in the western United States. The police had the information that that child was in the vicinity, but he was not wanted by the police at all, so they began to chase the boy. They tracked and caught the boy but one the kids escaped, on his way back to the town, he ran into a police helicopter that was on a nearby hill. The boy tried to hide inside a bush but they were able to get him by accident, using a night vision goggle the police were able to spot a child who looked exactly like the one the police were after.

{"prompt":"Instead of life followed by death , there is a third form of existence which ends once everyone living forgets you","text":"Instead of life followed by death, there is a third form of existence which ends once everyone living forgets you or dies before you have time to try to remember them. But for all three, the way I see it, is really just for those who have no memory of the past and do not care or understand those who have memories. For the rest of us, we have the memories, all that remains is to carry on and be thankful.\nI love the way her last paragraph makes you pause and think about whether the memory of loved ones who have passed might be an issue for us.\nA lot of people don\u2019t let thoughts about the loved one they feel they have lost to an illness consume them \u2013 and this goes for those who think that way when the illness hasn\u2019t yet occurred as well! But I agree that a lot of thought is usually given when the loved one has a serious illness \u2013 and maybe that thought, though necessary for the wellbeing of the person with the illness, might also be negative in the sense that it feels like a loss of control over the outcome.\nYou could be right. My son in law died from a heart attack a week after he\u2019d been told that he had cancer. It was a big shock to us both, and he wasn\u2019t at ease about his own death, but after a while it became second nature to us both, though it is important. When a loved one is still under this kind of stress, your thoughts are inevitably going to be negative, but that\u2019s a part of us each of us, whether we\u2019re conscious of it or not. At the time it was really important for my son in law to be happy and well, so I try not to dwell on the negative stuff at all, although you have to wonder whether all the negative thoughts he got from health visitors about his heart attack are also a sign of them not putting him at ease with his own illness. He did his full treatment and passed away a couple of months later. For a long time we didn\u2019t know exactly from when he had to have started having his treatment, so when in a few years I was having my treatment I asked a health professional if he could tell me which stage he was in, but she didn\u2019t know either. We will probably know within the next couple of months, in my case it\u2019s the last stage when the chemo is given, but it\u2019s a lottery whether it\u2019s in January or February, so it\u2019s important to work on my feelings of hopelessness, but just to get through so that I don\u2019t go into a depression at Christmas and see everything black!","token_len":557,"entropy":[2.5709,8.9756,10.1703,0.2855,0.9303,0.4255,2.9271,1.0737,1.915,4.8901,4.3853,0.3917,4.231,3.0977,6.2958,6.5817,5.9363,7.503,10.8572,0.11,6.0361,3.1401,2.1833,4.5019,0.5427,2.7611,3.4251,0.1205,5.8543,0.7153,3.7928,2.9746,0.4979,5.072,4.1551,3.3649,6.3498,1.684,2.2503,5.1609,4.567,0.8685,0.3086,0.3992,4.1062,7.3842,3.0673,6.4881,3.4597,0.7679,2.2614,3.3706,3.9158,1.0581,2.111,1.2083,2.4411,3.7821,0.0891,3.5525,5.5876,3.8831,5.6087,1.362,1.6196,4.1471,1.2065,3.7565,2.7244,2.8204,0.7765,0.1858,0.3743,2.1317,2.5963,3.04,4.4557,2.9371,5.9286,4.1709,3.404,1.0395,2.407,6.6982,0.7917,2.9984,3.8371,4.5005,2.1312,0.8434,6.1598,4.8303,2.5581,2.5332,6.6786,7.078,4.9476,4.0501,2.8005,6.3071,1.4278,0.9184,1.0866,5.9868,3.5863,4.4324,1.7507,7.6998,0.0365,4.5447,1.5727,3.5537,5.0231,1.0896,4.8686,4.3502,1.4301,3.7293,1.1323,2.4819,4.8888,2.4043,0.0593,0.757,3.0706,16.1804,7.0054,1.1823,6.9617,7.8006,2.8613,2.1417,7.7314,2.4235,5.3254,5.3859,2.6363,1.449,2.0724,5.0126,5.3037,1.6692,7.115,0.6654,6.0047,2.8633,3.4606,5.5825,0.7863,2.9149,0.5809,4.8152,2.6356,4.9846,5.0155,3.761,1.2488,6.531,2.8177,0.2475,0.1071,3.458,3.1159,6.0612,2.8039,5.0515,2.605,2.069,5.3989,1.2213,4.039,1.0772,0.0295,6.5475,2.0591,6.7194,2.603,3.5967,3.4691,4.5832,0.1574,2.3465,3.1176,4.1087,0.2445,3.5732,1.3747,5.5282,2.548,3.8542,4.681,4.3909,7.3101,2.9727,2.438,6.048,0.0952,0.9265,1.5728,3.9715,0.5374,0.2163,0.133,3.1472,3.2547,0.9485,7.8502,2.9188,1.6781,2.5531,0.1684,0.7394,5.6531,1.0671,2.2332,2.8908,2.3158,3.7402,2.2847,1.3666,5.4542,1.2424,1.1524,4.3294,4.0551,3.4617,3.4431,1.7711,4.5796,5.3282,6.0304,1.9511,3.4893,3.3643,1.4062,1.914,0.1587,3.5325,3.4571,1.6813,1.7389,9.7345,0.2004,2.2764,2.4815,5.5758,1.3686,0.8275,1.5996,4.3821,0.7648,3.3689,1.1864,1.6632,3.512,2.9667,0.961,3.9587,4.7006,1.4089,1.4816,3.2673,4.2125,0.4542,0.2088,0.0315,4.9419,3.6718,3.4317,2.7638,4.4218,2.057,1.6953,1.2748,5.0039,2.3237,1.1014,2.8376,2.1464,7.8208,0.0072,0.9513,2.3543,3.8714,2.068,6.4537,2.196,3.2553,3.3409,5.2789,4.2439,3.2031,1.6849,0.0398,1.9975,5.1351,5.8203,4.9207,2.4562,0.0006,1.9758,0.5742,6.2193,1.9859,2.425,6.7639,3.2032,0.2037,1.5701,3.148,1.3316,2.2395,3.0715,6.8251,0.026,1.7888,2.8102,4.1662,0.0108,5.5565,7.6288,4.7754,0.0445,3.597,3.9014,0.6871,3.5331,0.0461,4.0388,5.8054,0.4127,0.1737,0.1196,0.0108,0.4547,6.0201,1.2022,3.896,3.3092,0.8894,3.9037,2.7679,1.3212,5.4883,0.3572,4.1636,0.0176,0.2855,2.0143,4.4252,1.5338,3.6665,1.3043,2.6545,2.4349,6.8174,2.01,0.0081,3.2793,0.3871,1.7152,3.3168,4.9487,4.4976,0.22,1.645,5.0512,5.2706,3.9209,0.3311,4.696,2.8118,6.1545,1.9524,1.7256,1.3934,3.5797,4.5198,1.5811,7.2024,12.0926,4.0278,0.6269,4.6855,0.2167,2.4385,3.9753,3.2034,3.6037,0.7832,8.0266,3.0315,8.0934,1.6463,2.6931,0.0838,3.0707,1.4233,3.1815,1.743,0.2923,3.6543,3.8551,4.8768,7.5875,7.1019,2.0176,5.7737,1.1594,1.9271,2.8218,0.269,2.0746,1.1739,0.881,5.6401,3.2354,1.9128,0.0821,2.9882,2.6684,0.3881,0.0785,0.0064,2.0924,5.0625,9.3003,4.7793,0.6593,2.8748,3.5206,2.7686,7.896,4.5187,2.8057,3.3176,1.6336,3.3519,3.1701,7.0911,3.3076,3.3798,2.0115,3.2877,2.5454,5.3049,3.0687,4.5139,1.9091,4.4526,4.4377,4.8573,4.9502,1.2369,1.0416,1.8105,2.3817,0.1218,4.2259,7.1743,1.3357,0.4838,0.9184,1.4124,3.4426,3.3336,1.8652,0.0942,0.0207,0.0026,2.6923,4.5275,0.8514,3.6835,7.1344,3.1952,5.0062,6.0937,1.8732,0.0758,1.9871,0.0566,1.526,1.2928,5.3171,2.9583,3.8488,5.2132,3.2381,0.0076,0.253,2.585,3.3109,1.6884,5.4122,2.9396,7.57,0.0684,2.1075,6.6969,1.3548,1.6622,2.1881,2.7482,0.0124,0.0531,2.392,11.9242,7.4015,2.3517,1.3465,0.0048,0.0494,3.8972,8.0255,0.3007,1.2293,1.4519,1.8338,1.7954,1.5535,0.0051,0.0299,2.6088,0.7601,6.8782,1.8692,5.7474,4.5806,3.0134,6.6825,0.0029,2.7135,2.2773,5.9758,2.427,3.7875,2.1974,6.9651,1.4826,1.1346,1.6683,0.1466,0.0169,0.0315,4.3589,1.8054,2.1113,3.6302,3.9545,7.1877,2.0583,3.3454,6.7578,8.944,8.2023]}

''","text":"`` Sergei, you have five seconds to put down the damn accordion and help me move the body or I swear I will beat you to death with the shovel. '' I am not your wife. You cannot threaten me! ''\n'' Well... it won't be a problem. But since you have made the decision to be here and not return to Moscow, you should think of me a little more as a friend, not an enemy! '' I have never said, you are not my friend! I can only say, you are my husband, and if you make a mistake today, this will end in your blood in the middle of the street.. ''\nI stared at the door, where the policeman was standing. I opened the door wide, so that the two fell. '' You can stop the policeman. Please help me move my husband away. He has turned off his radio and won't get out of the van unless he is helped! ''\nThe policeman pulled me into a corner, put his hand on one of the door handles, and said, with a hint of contempt,\n'' You want to go to the hospital to help the corpse? I am going to take you to jail! Do you want to end up with a dead fucker on your hands? ''\nI went up to my boyfriend and patted him on the back. '' Don Quixote. How come a policeman didn't beat him until the end? ''\n'' You have never put an order in my mouth, so I will do it now. Your friend has been beaten to death. As for you, Sergei, I will make sure that you do your life in prison. And it will not fit your head! ''\nI saw one of the boys in a uniform of a police officer in the kitchen. He opened the door and asked me what was on that accordion.\nI saw that the blood was running down the body from all over. The boy on the scooter put my boyfriend in the van and took out a bottle of water, started watering the body, and began to wash blood from the ground.\nThe boy was shocked. And in his eyes there was no mercy. The corpse turned from cold to warm, and the boy began to clean the blood and take it with a cloth.\nI didn't notice anything strange with the boy, but suddenly he looked at us sideways. I asked the young policeman why he looked at us.\n'' Yes, I thought that I could, '' this is how the young guy answered. '' If only one of us had not gone into the van.. ''\nAfter this event and before our wedding day of three months later came the tragedy, which will be the most significant in our life.","token_len":557,"entropy":[13.3929,4.1327,2.6296,2.6512,6.7903,3.0637,1.0196,5.0868,3.4226,1.2879,6.9277,8.9013,0.2194,2.4268,7.6095,1.1686,5.6404,1.9697,5.7985,5.9377,1.9296,6.0218,1.4565,1.633,4.2456,0.6211,1.9198,0.5268,1.629,2.5205,7.4808,1.8336,9.0579,3.8372,3.754,2.4655,4.5039,6.3518,1.2781,2.1603,4.2303,6.9742,0.3699,4.9179,2.4791,3.0719,5.077,4.9267,4.2153,4.2032,4.9381,0.0028,1.3294,3.2359,1.0718,1.1212,3.6031,5.8215,0.897,2.2722,5.1266,2.9112,2.3884,0.793,4.8112,3.9325,3.2924,3.3086,4.4403,1.5461,3.3916,0.5598,1.8552,2.8799,4.7888,2.4316,3.6207,3.9193,0.7744,1.0242,3.9436,0.6756,2.23,2.3631,2.5196,3.1084,0.2442,4.1915,1.666,2.405,2.754,3.5528,3.661,5.1712,3.8361,2.7009,2.2378,1.5337,0.8047,2.3244,1.8198,4.4378,2.865,1.7012,1.9073,1.8217,0.622,1.1508,5.5038,1.9277,1.1407,3.1242,0.7374,5.0487,1.4787,0.7814,6.0443,0.4891,4.9921,1.1094,4.913,1.9965,2.7941,5.9701,5.2897,1.3343,6.0768,0.0467,0.5868,1.5986,9.0839,1.6886,1.031,2.7465,7.5881,0.3682,1.3745,4.4573,1.997,5.3269,1.411,5.6613,1.8226,2.0518,1.0218,2.0175,5.3174,1.6476,0.2044,5.7849,1.5196,4.8739,0.8557,1.6173,3.3901,7.8762,4.3675,3.4524,3.4404,3.16,5.5114,3.1213,4.7541,1.9357,5.0162,4.8768,0.4385,3.715,2.078,6.5381,3.978,1.4674,2.5143,2.4019,5.8374,5.2899,1.7701,3.2664,1.5791,4.2726,0.0023,4.5093,2.2195,0.8276,1.1938,5.9137,5.2581,1.7306,1.9981,5.5808,2.8358,1.0178,1.046,2.2548,0.8409,4.4753,2.6212,2.4886,1.8668,1.5134,1.2615,5.5049,1.4081,1.0032,0.4325,5.6536,0.524,1.2795,5.1295,0.8746,0.8321,0.4164,2.5291,0.6236,4.027,0.6081,5.1728,0.0364,4.1377,0.2103,3.5709,0.2758,3.0979,4.1348,0.5115,2.2515,1.4321,0.6968,2.1803,4.2973,3.9358,2.7005,6.4235,0.7013,2.3701,2.1594,2.5446,0.2805,2.6717,1.476,0.5696,6.1189,2.1606,4.9474,0.5686,1.8949,0.3312,7.1599,1.1792,2.6863,1.5284,4.4796,9.8139,0.5862,3.5369,1.2729,1.2789,3.6631,1.0962,0.5404,0.9372,4.3503,3.3319,0.545,3.6331,4.9728,1.6912,7.1324,0.1286,0.2613,0.2998,0.0114,1.1948,0.7521,1.48,3.0947,13.8974,0.0088,0.0062,2.7382,4.7778,3.8698,6.347,2.869,4.5376,0.0015,5.8933,3.1813,6.1457,2.9309,2.3879,0.8014,1.1323,0.6798,1.34,2.6252,2.9569,4.2699,5.5284,4.1929,3.4804,1.4908,2.1356,3.6011,1.7116,3.8895,1.147,2.5232,3.7755,1.1014,3.1875,0.5549,5.0597,3.7426,2.528,2.1559,4.0621,1.1655,0.0659,1.7879,5.8736,1.6054,2.4754,0.243,7.9397,0.233,1.736,1.8744,3.9682,1.5931,1.6735,0.6867,2.5844,5.1782,6.8777,2.7279,2.8266,1.2303,3.9665,4.9083,1.025,2.6724,8.7117,1.8034,5.8196,3.6651,0.8927,0.41,1.1972,4.3542,5.1726,0.3022,0.2582,5.685,2.4867,2.8418,3.954,4.3862,1.5233,2.3382,0.6645,3.3564,1.8257,6.3492,1.3263,1.0433,6.043,0.3977,0.3695,1.1016,3.6224,1.2782,2.3556,1.9479,4.2754,3.9412,9.6759,0.0049,0.3255,1.5032,2.8912,4.3599,1.8521,1.55,7.1193,0.964,4.0649,0.923,0.7184,5.6784,3.8945,3.9585,1.991,2.2128,2.2175,3.453,4.4562,0.0966,9.7491,0.3429,5.888,5.5541,5.2503,1.6846,0.907,2.1363,1.1527,2.8934,3.7476,1.091,4.0713,0.3285,2.1278,2.2475,5.6831,7.6748,1.4067,2.5143,0.9848,0.6242,4.0432,0.9163,4.0788,7.3289,1.392,0.5482,5.0264,0.4168,1.7428,2.0932,2.1278,2.7702,6.0268,1.4345,5.3653,4.5006,2.3222,4.1287,4.2603,0.2115,1.6854,4.0526,0.7048,2.7828,6.9813,4.9332,4.0005,6.8473,0.5697,2.3482,1.2961,0.8155,2.0824,1.4803,3.8072,0.2232,5.6043,1.2423,1.5211,3.3919,4.7891,1.2081,4.3013,4.7517,4.1214,0.6802,1.1294,1.6817,4.7984,0.0017,4.4248,2.4482,2.4805,4.9082,0.5229,1.5224,1.7703,1.3358,5.2166,1.64,3.1992,1.6219,5.929,8.3518,0.9394,2.3512,3.4016,2.9505,4.9964,2.332,2.5804,0.4325,3.9119,0.9691,0.616,1.0979,1.11,0.2532,5.4947,0.4223,1.8613,3.7756,2.985,3.3357,2.8757,4.822,7.7384,7.0158,1.8636,3.61,2.8191,4.7142,3.5298,8.1378,1.0345,1.1858,4.8144,4.9151,4.984,0.6198,1.1133,1.444,3.7733,4.3063,3.1894,0.6224,2.8264,8.5824,1.2113,0.4063,4.9224,3.5813,6.9319,5.245,3.7753,4.7268,6.1961,2.5257,4.7885,5.8573,1.5447,3.6768,7.2546,0.6373,6.1984,2.4157,3.8194,4.4638,1.5965,2.4238,2.7792,4.5606,2.5253,2.0204,2.2818,0.7585]}
{"prompt":"Everybody lives in his\/her personalized utopia . Your character thinks that something is nagging him\/her","text":"Everybody lives in his\/her personalized utopia. Your character thinks that something is nagging him\/her about something for a while and he\/she finally finds something to make him\/her stop. This is something that usually brings about the need to go to the city-state and stop the problem. Once done that, he has enough experience to move onto the next city-state, and then another time to move onto the next one. This is something that could take up to 5 years in the game I think, so I don't want to push it too hard.\n- If the player wanted to leave at a later point, he could. It may take a week if everything is done within 24 hours, it may take 2 months if everything needs at least a month to get done, but there is no \"final boss\" to beat or something like that. There is only one big battle for the player to prepare for, because there are several cities that could be \"under attack\" at different times. The player can decide to go anywhere, but they may get attacked anyway, so there's no real \"exit\" in the sense of \"going to the city that I will never have to fight at or have to protect anymore\". Just keep in mind that I think there are a lot of different things that might happen at a later stage in the game. If the player wants to go wherever without planning it, he can leave on one of the ships from the main city.\n- The only downside to it is that it takes a huge amount of time and a lot of investment. As I said, at the beginning of the game, at time zero, there is nothing to protect. You need to protect your country from the war that started somewhere else so that you don't get to fight again. You should find something to protect at every new level, you simply have to learn how to do it. It's easier and quicker to protect your country with just one city-state, because you can train a lot with it, but it also takes much more time. However, since we can train as many ships as we want with a city-state, we can train a lot with a smaller city-state so it's not that bad.\nThe city-states have some limitations that can come in handy. Like: if there are no more enemies in your country, you lose some of the ability of the cities such as the ability to use certain buildings and things. On top of that, you lose some cities that can be taken over. It's like training, this is a kind of \"feed\" that we receive from the city-states so that we don't run out of food (ships) or things to fight with (enemies).","token_len":559,"entropy":[8.8723,1.1,5.3152,5.3316,0.0029,10.1071,9.6744,0.0387,1.3553,5.4149,5.6386,6.6108,2.783,5.7572,1.2367,9.1105,2.8493,1.6343,0.6978,0.0036,2.7862,1.855,6.0039,1.3874,1.3897,1.9242,3.4427,0.3536,0.0182,4.3468,3.8758,2.9988,1.9171,5.1024,1.0093,0.1607,0.0064,3.0423,2.2591,3.0428,1.0566,4.5041,1.1824,5.2934,6.6394,3.111,2.7231,5.7773,0.8374,4.6787,1.9847,1.2227,6.6253,5.9567,1.2907,2.2305,4.2653,1.5968,4.7249,0.6855,5.6162,5.7558,4.1662,1.8081,2.5246,6.2807,5.1366,4.6442,0.9418,4.6888,3.6549,1.1997,0.1175,4.2713,2.3204,0.0441,2.3196,1.8191,2.698,5.4949,5.1568,2.5973,3.3818,1.0454,1.1521,0.2165,3.3046,0.4271,2.3774,1.1398,3.1192,0.5798,5.5458,3.5218,3.2517,0.5066,3.1647,1.5114,4.361,1.732,2.2589,8.6315,2.1946,1.5938,2.4449,2.064,2.8825,0.0009,3.4083,0.2623,4.6079,1.4267,0.2476,2.4125,0.6098,1.3548,7.3589,4.8177,2.6817,1.9754,4.94,0.2449,5.6174,4.7627,2.6488,2.6096,1.3193,0.8676,1.541,2.6738,5.2464,3.0756,4.4622,1.6643,1.3481,5.1811,4.4576,5.2919,1.8434,3.3627,5.4123,4.7863,0.1336,1.3572,5.5212,0.8214,0.1941,3.3084,1.8272,1.3173,0.5217,6.8473,8.1562,0.0585,1.7099,1.7293,1.6949,1.8058,1.3625,0.9776,1.8007,4.2358,1.1312,1.3406,4.6393,4.7581,4.9912,0.5894,2.9704,4.119,4.039,4.6287,1.0415,0.0298,0.2987,3.8369,0.7123,2.2496,1.4394,5.8877,4.3062,3.9802,1.2999,1.4288,0.9542,6.6315,0.3677,1.2096,5.3499,2.8624,1.3621,4.7278,5.3448,1.9673,4.0504,1.0927,5.6001,7.3587,1.9408,0.5992,2.6327,4.9904,0.1974,0.9043,2.5125,2.042,1.8807,4.439,1.167,1.6958,5.8887,1.8025,1.6616,2.9697,3.2702,4.4478,2.7068,6.8004,1.7259,1.1204,3.1499,2.9131,0.6911,2.7495,3.1967,7.2182,0.9929,3.0057,1.2925,4.4973,0.7152,1.9812,4.3199,1.3317,1.2589,1.31,5.1053,4.1508,4.8822,3.3586,3.9923,0.6926,1.5751,5.0583,6.2833,5.3253,0.2454,6.475,5.5566,1.2343,5.3673,3.9219,1.4096,0.0044,0.3849,4.207,3.2892,2.8915,1.1143,2.1166,0.6198,0.074,2.8378,3.1658,0.9617,4.1637,1.0545,2.5932,3.1781,3.966,2.8863,1.9939,0.1463,0.0623,1.3295,3.3288,1.9565,0.2452,2.1773,0.0762,1.3315,6.6766,6.9379,6.1679,2.6243,1.1274,1.5642,2.5799,4.714,4.5302,5.5981,0.7284,0.7947,6.9359,5.4945,0.8495,4.3785,1.8512,2.0388,2.6776,0.26,2.3843,4.0322,5.3782,0.9148,4.8748,0.5236,0.4468,1.7334,2.4385,1.159,5.4548,0.1794,0.0167,0.6888,2.5018,3.9234,0.3413,0.0222,5.9668,1.7272,4.4275,2.6029,0.5903,1.118,5.9796,1.3554,1.1677,0.6247,0.2483,0.0922,0.8169,6.2398,7.1646,5.192,0.648,2.1005,1.33,3.1139,1.6066,4.9122,1.543,2.6579,3.6691,0.3976,4.1153,1.8905,6.5781,2.1345,1.5845,5.1753,3.2216,4.4561,6.419,1.7574,5.4854,0.9792,0.7873,2.4503,0.0006,1.6125,4.1582,3.4085,3.1842,0.6155,2.8578,4.2845,5.5216,2.4796,0.8878,1.5702,4.1417,4.7775,4.9457,4.3681,1.492,4.6341,7.5188,1.6621,0.0101,3.6807,1.5261,0.0447,1.6458,0.5405,0.7986,2.7977,1.2698,5.0759,4.1288,2.4543,0.7052,5.4082,2.0054,0.5336,4.0281,4.072,1.6813,2.5271,2.2435,0.0347,1.3634,2.8284,1.2729,1.2207,5.8399,3.4495,1.2004,4.2699,2.5949,1.6631,1.5255,1.5152,3.5958,1.4844,3.4026,0.7224,0.6758,1.7876,4.9046,0.0633,4.4884,4.234,2.8778,3.1278,4.7391,0.5797,2.431,0.2039,0.2839,0.3145,2.9227,2.834,2.6633,0.1609,0.0143,0.6139,2.1235,0.6424,2.4965,2.3887,0.2065,2.0555,2.0363,3.685,0.8261,0.132,0.0068,4.2747,3.5325,1.0968,2.04,2.0259,3.2153,0.544,1.2242,4.5494,4.7367,0.2467,1.7317,2.9629,3.9802,4.1699,2.6462,2.346,4.708,2.1774,0.2784,1.426,5.5598,4.6468,3.2651,2.7084,1.1356,2.1573,4.0254,4.0163,1.8263,2.191,2.8573,0.452,1.1547,3.8901,3.7356,1.6383,2.1422,4.0103,3.8297,2.4607,3.1309,8.0027,0.0553,2.0939,6.7806,0.0536,3.9657,5.6928,3.9647,2.4021,4.0426,1.2491,4.8812,1.8301,0.0016,0.1698,0.1539,1.9082,1.7855,1.8049,6.1331,2.3111,2.4494,1.3011,3.7473,0.8975,2.5209,3.124,0.7987,3.2871,6.1109,5.0865,6.1399,0.9406,2.2173,6.124,0.0021,2.528,8.6004,4.4267,1.8392,4.085,7.0155,0.9355,0.7248,1.8052,0.3961,0.3931,3.2357,0.777,0.8408,3.4063,0.0003,5.1587,0.502,0.1492,2.6647,4.7332,9.3165,2.7501,1.7293,4.0531,1.4558,3.2885,2.8214,2.8876,6.7369,0.031,0.2537]}
{"prompt":"Sirens sing of whatever it is the nearby sailors desire ... which frankly leaves them with an interesting and somewhat disconcerting view of humanity .","text":"Sirens sing of whatever it is the nearby sailors desire... which frankly leaves them with an interesting and somewhat disconcerting view of humanity.\"\nAs part of the public education program, the ship will be equipped with a classroom, lecture hall and kitchen and dining areas, providing \"a rich environment for teaching students the beauty of oceanography\".\nOnboard the ship will also be the largest environmental monitoring ship ever built by the US, the US Coast Guard's Sea Star.\nIt will allow the researchers to collect hundreds of measurements every year, \"including temperature and salinity of the water, atmospheric conditions and ship noise and vibrations.\"\nIt will also allow the research team to do ocean acoustics - to study underwater sounds - by listening to the seafloor.\n\"The noise of drilling is being filtered out. Noise from the drilling vessels is going to be a lot smaller,\" said Professor Pugh, who leads the study with colleagues from The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the University of Washington and Northwestern University.\nBut one thing that scientists hope to find is evidence of the species' migration. As the drill passes the water, sound reflecting off the underwater surface, or \"beam echoes\", should also be picked up.\n\"This may show us whether they are coming up from the deep sea, migrating at depth or going down as they are drilled out,\" he said.\n\"The fact that we don't have any is an anomaly because we are not getting back some of the very most important marine species from our Southern Ocean that are known to be on the decline.\"\nDr David Jones, an acoustic engineer and co-author of the study, said that the only thing that was more important than finding the minke whale was \"understanding what the drivers of the changes are\".\n\"There are so many variables in the ocean environment and it is difficult to predict what's going to happen, but we certainly hope these results will shed some light into this,\" he said.\nWhen the minke whales come up into the surface, they release bubbles that, if large enough, may be picked up by the airborne sonar system.\nBut a problem with such a system is knowing what to look for.\n\"If we wanted to find deep seafloor animals and we had a very low probability of capturing the signal, it is pretty useless to be doing those acoustic surveys [unless] the signal is very loud,\" Professor Pugh said.\n\"What we are trying to do on this cruise is find those very loud signals\".\nThe researchers plan to return to King William Islands the following year to repeat the experiment and measure the animals in still more detail.\nPosted 23 AugAugust 2012TueTuesday 23 AugAugust 2012 at

I'm the main character! Or so you would have me be. I want you to know that no matter what you write, I refuse to be the main character in your little game and will avoid any instance where you try to put me into a situation that does so. You 'll be forced to meet me. I am determined and will not rest until I take you to task and make my mark on a world in which I will have no problem forcing others to obey my will.\nI always wondered what it was like being a monster, but have never tried to imagine it. This was not the way I was raised as a monster had to be a monster in order to survive, but I never really thought about it. I had no problem loving humans I guess because I was raised by one. I was raised in a convent, in the land of humans. I am also a vampire with a half human half vampire son.\nI had to watch my son grow up in a place where they thought he was not human. But I always held an inner secret that he is in essence as human as we are and was my son. I knew that my son was the key to breaking my curse. As such I prided myself upon keeping him. One day he ran away from me, in fear.\nAs usual I did not have a good feeling about it. I knew there would be a problem yet I did not know what. I looked up at night and saw the moon shining brightly, knowing what the problem was. I had to run, fast like a vampire, knowing where my son would most likely hide. I had planned ahead and prepared myself. This was our home, it had been in my family for years. I left, to some other part of the world.\nI headed west and my son would most likely be there. I had hoped to find him, I hoped I would have an encounter. I hoped I would have a fight. This was the way I planned, this was the way that I wished.\nWe had left home in the middle of the night with a lot of weapons, mainly knives. We had just gotten to the car, after leaving the house and being gone for an hour something bad happened. I turned the key in my pocket and started to drive, when I look around my car is still locked. I grabbed a knife and started to open the rear hatch. I pushed the key in but nothing happened. I went to the side window and tried again. Nothing. I was panicked and afraid to go home, to the city I thought they would kill me for what I was. I looked around the woods to make this right, but there was a lake and I was scared of drowning so I went forward.","token_len":560,"entropy":[5.5066,1.9487,1.5556,4.7679,5.6175,1.3773,3.4143,6.5554,3.5858,2.6696,3.1757,1.9866,3.0392,3.7593,0.826,2.0426,4.6683,0.8861,0.1784,1.8683,0.5988,5.822,0.132,0.5403,1.5022,5.6195,0.6207,1.2837,7.7954,0.0838,2.366,2.8498,1.605,0.0677,3.5552,1.6608,7.7843,3.2938,4.199,2.7531,7.9654,2.1707,11.3758,0.8311,1.2724,3.8961,0.1455,4.5976,0.744,2.8011,1.3954,1.886,1.8789,4.9832,7.2003,2.0146,3.2378,8.869,2.9012,1.9866,5.4524,0.1793,5.9458,1.4681,3.8431,1.5312,2.7886,6.4822,3.3271,3.1832,1.9666,5.1396,0.2094,0.8235,5.7877,2.3819,1.9091,3.7337,3.2589,3.2062,4.5348,3.6683,0.7471,4.9103,1.7516,4.1811,0.3334,0.915,1.9664,3.5096,1.8432,4.5058,7.549,4.3213,0.2073,5.466,1.6323,1.0369,0.5552,2.3172,5.4536,5.417,6.6817,1.4906,2.3967,1.9934,0.4915,2.3299,1.1051,5.3692,2.4623,2.508,6.8524,1.3895,5.2048,0.7068,4.4527,1.7572,0.9795,4.6692,3.0576,3.5217,1.8948,3.457,0.6676,2.1368,0.6187,4.697,0.2762,0.7772,9.4622,5.2365,0.9069,3.2679,0.6385,4.0739,0.1644,0.223,2.2476,2.3702,1.8509,1.5078,3.2359,3.3945,1.7227,0.8517,0.6492,0.8981,1.2663,3.2811,1.9545,4.753,6.3241,4.8942,5.9141,4.7939,3.1449,0.9159,1.7249,2.6761,1.9462,4.2872,1.1484,1.4391,2.0502,1.5508,3.3619,0.6877,8.9832,1.7214,4.0302,2.0627,6.1312,0.4229,6.128,1.3199,1.2196,3.682,4.8898,1.6087,3.4764,4.6569,1.1214,6.5434,2.3963,1.6528,0.3568,5.3722,0.8718,1.8859,1.3809,3.7023,1.9825,5.3563,1.7532,5.1493,1.5468,0.2559,3.0522,1.162,3.2879,0.7668,3.9523,5.5654,1.3297,0.7858,3.2416,3.0191,0.9859,3.9592,1.5848,3.7168,6.2411,5.3074,4.1875,4.6856,1.9066,2.7597,3.2237,5.4338,7.4983,6.1744,2.8704,0.9188,4.9327,1.432,2.9486,4.9521,5.5514,3.5639,1.4221,1.412,3.6674,1.1731,3.2375,1.1167,1.178,3.2204,5.1109,0.1688,6.8837,3.2846,1.4788,1.573,4.4471,3.377,1.259,9.9072,0.1704,0.0328,4.1211,4.4949,1.4012,4.1733,5.8606,0.3529,2.4142,5.3034,2.0825,0.9222,1.8362,1.895,5.1869,2.805,2.3007,2.4093,3.8754,5.6419,1.3666,3.8528,0.3033,3.2082,1.8163,3.0343,4.5424,1.0158,1.9541,0.6721,0.977,3.275,4.516,2.0929,0.2728,1.9042,3.3853,9.5572,1.6819,2.0374,0.0532,2.0424,0.9854,3.095,1.1459,5.3809,2.1044,1.3618,7.1502,1.173,1.4471,2.1567,3.7261,2.3022,2.3012,2.8063,8.0781,3.727,3.5977,1.8314,0.1955,0.2176,1.1169,3.4001,1.5887,4.732,2.868,6.6377,6.1426,0.8857,3.548,1.4789,6.2471,3.4154,2.0532,0.6301,1.4399,7.5109,0.149,5.1417,0.6009,1.1684,3.0245,6.7804,4.2476,1.9347,4.0122,1.4381,1.7794,5.4534,0.955,6.0896,4.5012,1.5439,4.2797,3.4495,1.1,4.1935,1.1593,2.9192,0.7502,2.8841,0.7825,1.4037,5.9085,4.3378,4.0831,7.0871,3.5023,3.8734,0.0232,0.3551,0.1714,1.116,0.9836,1.2307,6.7915,4.9426,2.5395,4.6488,1.2416,3.5012,6.5611,0.1284,1.3444,2.1889,0.5419,1.3998,2.5209,4.0763,2.038,1.5974,0.5774,1.8728,2.8352,3.5173,2.2899,0.7876,3.0065,3.9218,3.8617,2.867,1.2192,4.1355,1.5528,0.3701,2.1361,1.4568,3.8601,1.8384,4.8516,0.683,1.994,3.0573,0.9155,4.353,2.6778,3.1692,0.2827,0.9483,0.4454,3.9241,0.4074,4.9519,3.3208,1.4713,4.0665,2.6184,5.033,3.8721,3.0171,1.2126,1.5731,0.012,0.623,0.0665,3.621,2.6008,4.0714,0.0969,6.9727,2.1916,7.1371,2.9941,1.0782,1.7816,1.5088,4.131,3.5555,2.7243,1.0067,6.2936,1.7762,5.0479,3.8404,1.1139,2.2686,3.0497,4.1468,5.1639,0.4447,4.0245,0.2358,9.4699,4.4694,0.1934,0.2948,1.4495,5.1114,2.7684,4.1982,2.5548,0.8273,2.1273,0.5766,3.8513,1.0777,3.3713,2.9377,4.9322,0.9384,7.7101,2.9984,3.4074,1.7376,6.3306,3.4758,4.3054,0.6567,1.3016,6.3642,1.9912,2.2673,0.8153,2.2514,0.5758,3.4695,0.6605,5.4852,3.6473,0.9153,1.4179,5.0381,0.8222,2.8802,2.35,4.0639,4.6561,0.4849,0.2619,1.0079,3.8146,1.7586,1.096,3.2612,4.4321,0.7402,3.8156,4.0101,0.9306,1.3794,0.9427,1.1253,2.7202,7.4422,1.7013,5.7109,2.6911,1.7121,3.6434,2.0114,2.6643,2.2359,5.3087,2.9169,3.9945,5.3377,1.1475,2.6611,0.1427,2.9716,3.6616,0.4769,1.6577,2.9812,1.0598,3.4085,1.2534,2.0682,9.2149,3.5384,3.4323,9.1739,5.8425,1.2385,1.6503,2.7843,0.4401,3.1452,6.6289,2.4636,2.148,1.8829,3.1276,2.2833,2.951,4.9831,0.0998,2.0654,7.1961,1.0614]}

{"prompt":"Two men are standing near a ridge and start challenging each other 's beliefs .","text":"Two men are standing near a ridge and start challenging each other's beliefs. They say,'what are you talking about? How can you have faith in something that we know to be true if we know for sure it is wrong?'The person in the lower position in line 1 answers,'but how could anyone be sure that they are thinking the right things? If you know that you are mistaken, why keep on believing you are right?\nAsking for a reason, I started to wonder if this problem was something that only happens amongst people who have a strong belief in a certain way.\nMy friend asks me over the phone, 'is it possible for something to be right, but you dont have enough proof to know that it is the true answer? Then, if that happens, how can you be assured that what youre thinking is actually right? I tried to explain to this individual what the purpose of the scientific method was, based on my understanding, that I simply havent yet reached my place at which I would know an answer that I have enough proof about. Does this kind of question, like most questions, need a hypothesis or question?\nThis is the last line I have been able to write. I hope this helps you understand how my mind works. I just want you to understand that I know that the scientific method is not the best thing in your life, that I feel bad for the kids who have to go through the testing and training they do. I felt bad for the people who had to undergo this type of medical procedure that no one really liked.\nMy friend says that he would like to know my point of view about this. My view is that if a person has to go through something horrible and is convinced that the procedure is a mistake, or has to undergo something to avoid something horrible that one can think of, such as receiving a test to clear one's drug\/alcohol addiction, or is told that a certain procedure would help relieve a serious illness, then why wouldnt one want to go through the process. How would you feel about people telling you that they have it and knowing it for sure? I dont think anyone likes being told that they live on a cloud. It puts you in a very scarse position.\nI would love to know what that person who was convinced that this is wrong thing is trying to prove and why he thinks it is wrong. I understand that I cannot be sure that I am right, but I do want people to stop talking for people. When I was growing up, my mother was a very serious person, and I just wanted her to like me, but she did. If someone were to tell me that I was wrong and I didnt know how to prove it, this would be a scary feeling.","token_len":560,"entropy":[7.2455,3.17,6.4523,3.7657,1.7567,8.8673,3.1413,7.719,8.6406,2.3673,0.0248,5.5177,6.1178,0.8178,2.8537,3.244,11.2112,5.791,2.3336,0.5668,2.5045,0.0173,1.6098,4.217,1.4157,0.6631,3.4512,2.6846,1.2918,4.1689,1.0697,4.6515,3.2857,2.3914,0.0717,1.7308,5.9869,2.2893,3.1074,5.8923,1.5251,1.7535,1.7538,2.7648,0.5489,6.2884,5.8838,2.893,1.163,6.4581,3.9267,3.8907,6.1766,9.1156,7.2675,3.984,5.2931,4.3429,2.3338,4.7394,2.6235,2.8364,1.1211,2.3843,0.9877,7.0339,2.0027,2.2003,2.3516,1.7996,3.0136,1.4826,3.515,1.6527,1.6039,0.4047,4.4494,0.6708,3.4622,8.2799,3.7677,0.9548,4.8536,0.3388,1.3095,1.7073,5.249,11.0397,4.3163,3.1644,2.5788,4.1304,2.084,4.6338,5.1793,1.1732,3.3723,1.1678,2.5123,6.1687,1.472,3.9111,1.3122,4.2451,4.8201,6.9658,2.2667,0.6025,1.7279,2.5397,2.8392,1.2599,1.6955,2.7507,1.9727,4.163,0.6473,1.806,4.61,3.7332,6.3481,1.5983,6.6054,1.7618,0.1789,1.568,0.1993,4.5485,1.4263,1.8136,2.1128,4.8441,1.1743,0.9034,3.056,2.6954,1.847,2.4091,6.8349,3.2346,3.7948,4.0094,1.2849,3.2117,1.8285,0.788,0.2453,4.0173,5.6657,3.1173,1.5921,5.7489,3.6127,3.3545,3.7145,5.9254,0.366,2.0749,0.9541,0.3635,2.6335,7.1198,0.4944,3.8473,0.2333,9.5972,3.6632,0.2328,4.1352,2.0927,1.6141,3.5131,4.295,0.7954,2.1678,1.4022,3.4072,4.5116,2.908,2.4745,5.1597,0.1279,1.9683,7.3531,0.6591,1.997,1.1974,7.382,0.1261,1.6639,3.5309,3.2962,3.6042,2.7791,6.4644,11.5676,0.5761,4.951,5.0331,3.6687,5.8054,4.5691,5.6248,1.6935,2.5458,4.2946,6.516,0.1664,3.8214,1.8407,3.3631,6.6451,1.187,6.2872,1.2447,6.7508,1.2541,5.7866,0.0004,3.3031,4.5577,3.0373,3.0534,2.5575,0.9099,3.1111,2.3391,7.8979,2.4107,6.0055,2.2788,1.3903,3.2509,1.7507,2.2591,4.9617,4.6734,3.3413,2.9641,4.0382,1.3424,0.0013,4.13,2.0326,1.6064,3.9,1.5366,1.5872,1.4977,1.8694,2.3164,4.3928,4.6602,0.1305,0.7387,2.3483,5.0237,1.5014,1.8999,0.0686,2.4072,0.8102,1.7713,4.4406,1.6668,3.0591,2.5749,0.0629,0.751,1.4102,2.6014,3.2672,3.8846,2.6293,6.0838,0.1253,1.3927,2.4082,2.4463,6.1072,3.8737,0.6566,3.0254,6.0872,1.4051,2.3849,1.78,2.0863,0.6618,1.9281,6.5676,2.0366,5.7422,4.7883,2.4358,2.0827,1.2276,7.4065,1.098,0.4743,0.8815,2.7182,0.3212,3.7629,0.1844,4.3518,2.1646,3.6634,0.0021,5.5286,1.7465,3.5908,6.1615,0.3461,4.5853,5.3575,1.001,1.4694,3.7246,0.8133,3.0783,1.8952,2.4326,3.8357,1.3214,0.3467,2.0243,6.0514,4.9099,0.3333,0.0069,2.7386,1.9051,2.0779,4.5797,6.0137,0.5499,0.4457,2.8649,3.5326,1.0577,2.1033,3.0925,1.3334,0.0318,5.2871,6.0499,2.0398,4.4064,5.6746,0.6844,2.5621,3.9777,0.6297,3.5706,3.0737,0.5341,4.532,3.8585,1.4318,1.9824,4.307,3.6815,4.1226,4.8799,2.7112,2.5728,6.8823,2.1771,4.9688,0.8805,0.94,6.1917,0.1786,8.0201,1.2952,3.801,3.9298,6.6253,3.1352,0.125,8.0906,5.5405,0.4823,2.2475,0.2964,2.1802,4.554,3.6858,0.6784,3.3809,3.1523,5.0867,3.8733,3.0147,5.4854,2.7214,6.3613,2.4847,0.4992,0.9508,4.176,1.6539,11.6402,1.8067,2.5824,0.1135,1.7745,0.0515,1.9298,3.0009,4.7583,5.2873,2.1934,1.6266,1.1396,1.7603,4.5959,4.5781,0.613,0.669,1.3818,1.9697,6.0932,5.6264,6.1214,2.5705,4.2337,1.0146,0.9009,2.4618,5.7234,1.457,2.9907,6.1589,3.1955,0.3561,0.8268,0.903,7.9048,3.8619,1.6264,8.8773,2.0357,3.391,6.273,2.2216,0.6235,0.757,2.3888,11.7382,10.8789,2.3878,0.9101,1.032,1.4788,3.6526,2.7464,0.2373,1.8347,1.6084,5.586,1.6332,5.5648,2.9084,5.7209,0.9231,2.4802,2.6168,2.7822,9.3757,2.3867,4.0241,0.0252,3.3585,4.226,3.4745,2.858,3.4437,1.4975,0.4689,0.8187,0.4023,1.2014,5.1446,0.4808,2.6788,4.053,3.0858,1.189,1.0795,2.6184,0.8023,1.2236,1.294,0.9144,0.6912,2.5858,2.983,4.1709,0.1451,6.1605,4.0157,7.0159,6.2157,3.6461,4.8132,1.3824,2.0871,3.1994,0.0037,0.5035,2.3704,2.492,2.4066,1.713,3.4011,5.7044,1.5379,1.3358,1.0501,1.9564,5.0661,1.7065,2.2494,0.1079,7.3947,0.6343,2.0287,1.9655,1.2342,3.1266,4.0538,4.1742,2.8454,3.3723,0.1416,1.0986,0.4303,0.3768,1.6005,1.4695,0.6234,2.0422,2.4516,5.7063,1.5694,2.6717,0.2196,4.6427,0.3443,0.4141,5.464,0.6907,0.8265,1.5519,6.6321,3.9165,0.7253]}
{"prompt":"Tell me about a god . Any god .","text":"Tell me about a god. Any god. What we are all made of. Do we make our own gods or are they already there. I have been trying to think of a god or a goddess but it doesn\u2019t seem like anything I have been taught. I don\u2019t see anything in my school religious studies or history books that explain anything about the existence of gods. We get to know the history of ancient civilizations to which was filled with legends and myths about gods, but all the stories about gods I have read are vague\nI think our gods are made up of a lot of different things like the sun, moon, stars. I found out in one of my biology classes that the Sun and the Moon are part of the solar system. I have been wondering but I can\u2019t make anything of it. Maybe it doesn\u2019t even exist. What does it matter how much you know about the solar system or about gods. We were always told to believe in the ones we knew like that there were gods and gods that kept humans safe, but now I have learned that there are no gods\nWhat has become of all that which was said in the beginning to my Lord? We never heard it say, I will make a servant who will come before me with all his heart. Never did it say that one who would listen would be the servant of another and his heart would be free.\nHow many times could you hear that? How many times did you have to prove it again and again to get it through the other ears? How many times did you have to prove it that you cared? How many times did you have to prove it you really meant to do it? How many times did you have to prove it that you truly believed in who you believed and who you had chosen?\nI have taken steps because I believed. I felt the urge to do so when I heard the words in the beginning come out from that voice that came from deep down. I knew the words to be true. In my mind, I thought they held so much truth\nThe Lord says in the beginning to me, I will make a servant who will come before me with all his heart. I know that not all the words of the Lord seem to have deep meanings. I have always thought that it meant everything, but I have now learned not to think that way. I am not sure what the true meaning of that was. I know that the first time I ever heard that God said it I believed. I thought that there was only one person who could live up to it.

Use it with your mommy group, or your new single mom or dad group. If I ever read a recipe I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ll probably write my own (and then post here as well)\nThe most common causes of tooth pain include cavity, fracture, gum disease and tooth pain from nerve trauma or infection. Teeth are the strongest bone in the body so they provide an exceptional area to store pressure and stress in the body. Tooth pain can result in physical and mental distress, and discomfort. The main cause of tooth pain is the lack of proper dental care. Tooth cavity is defined as a hole or pocket in the enamel, dentine or pulp of the tooth; which is commonly caused by plaque bacteria or decay. The tooth is weakened and exposed to infection because bacteria grow in an organic environment due to a hole in the tooth and they multiply. It is also important to recognize that most tooth pain is caused by inflammation. There are various treatments available from general dentistry and also from specialists depending on what type of tooth pain you are experiencing.\nIf you have tooth pain and a cavity or a decayed tooth, immediate professional dental treatment is strongly recommended. Cavity or decayed teeth are in a weakened position, making them prone to breakage and therefore more susceptible to pain.\nA lot of people will see a dentist the first time they experience tooth pain. In a dental office, dentists normally clean the teeth using a dental prophylaxis device, or brush and floss. This is followed by a deep cleaning if necessary. Professional treatment also involves removing plaque build-up on the tooth surface, and polishing the tooth enamel in order to improve the oral health.\nDry mouth can be one of the causes of tooth pain, and this can often be resolved by drinking more water which moistens the mouth and increases saliva production.\nMost dental treatments to treat tooth pain and prevent more serious problems involve professional cleanings, scaling, the application of fluoride or sealants, as well as in cases of tooth fracture, filling the cavity or filling the cracks in the teeth.\nIf you are experiencing tooth pain over a long period, or with repeated bouts of tooth pain, you should see a general dentist if possible.\nAn experienced dentist can usually recognize the cause of the tooth pain, and help you manage the condition. If the tooth pain is severe and unrelenting, or if it is accompanied by additional conditions such as a fever, see your dentist immediately.\nThe first step, before treating tooth pain and preventing it, is to identify the cause of the pain and consult your dental doctor.","token_len":560,"entropy":[12.9064,2.5948,8.3367,2.2858,10.8737,3.2127,1.6125,9.8421,2.3883,8.4285,6.2928,5.0017,2.4587,6.244,1.2432,4.2858,4.9309,0.9249,14.6107,2.9785,3.1233,6.2422,4.6884,0.4926,4.1039,2.3921,3.8704,3.1369,8.4628,3.2706,10.1277,1.7936,2.0547,3.0264,5.7883,6.9068,1.8656,3.0717,2.5382,2.5376,0.7025,3.4454,5.1422,4.1041,4.5508,1.7729,1.3369,2.9013,3.1133,15.6416,7.6057,1.4263,4.6449,0.7852,1.0867,2.7846,0.2853,0.6443,4.342,3.3927,5.0089,0.7712,4.9128,2.9212,3.9358,4.4381,5.3997,3.7032,1.6087,2.2912,3.1182,5.6051,4.5012,2.1068,6.7763,0.3013,9.3744,5.0677,3.0539,12.4549,3.4455,6.0111,0.2652,3.5855,0.4508,2.5619,3.2139,4.3901,3.0062,7.1326,4.0069,2.6132,3.8416,0.3727,7.7592,0.0136,1.0024,2.5332,5.2633,4.0731,0.9938,0.4105,0.4529,4.6663,1.8792,5.4039,3.266,6.7185,6.4562,2.2323,3.0473,5.8371,1.7318,4.3706,2.9223,2.4063,1.8161,0.3848,4.2129,1.3606,1.652,4.9779,2.2981,5.659,1.7508,1.4185,4.8429,1.3664,2.5241,7.726,2.3571,2.7162,4.9992,2.0243,0.2244,0.759,0.151,0.2806,2.6529,3.9653,0.0049,3.7319,3.6574,1.6272,0.7736,3.4209,9.2303,1.2449,6.3359,0.1855,1.1919,3.3898,2.1247,7.7157,1.223,0.1852,7.7488,0.0018,3.0037,7.405,2.896,1.6207,5.317,1.4983,0.2639,0.7767,4.7649,6.0222,1.2559,5.4935,4.4208,0.0537,4.0074,6.9325,2.3029,6.3468,1.5193,1.8336,3.2575,1.6613,8.2971,2.0901,6.4168,0.2621,4.5381,4.2534,5.3185,3.4102,1.1026,5.2572,8.8136,1.5474,6.6263,0.0033,3.4967,6.8972,0.7601,0.1066,2.0951,3.2817,5.5545,5.5627,1.595,3.7716,0.5151,2.3887,3.2438,0.3223,4.4662,0.6188,4.4108,1.7976,1.6369,0.8974,0.9316,0.1221,4.3945,2.3542,4.1073,0.558,4.2184,4.1624,1.8538,6.2815,7.2852,1.9856,0.6436,1.9115,5.5677,1.3191,5.806,7.1447,0.0571,3.3179,1.1953,0.0509,1.9097,3.0185,0.8305,1.2449,0.714,0.1709,2.066,3.3449,0.4085,1.1067,3.7541,0.4696,2.1294,4.8681,6.1017,2.05,1.7032,7.92,0.6372,0.8433,0.7315,9.5627,5.9255,4.4012,3.7012,0.8174,6.6592,0.0852,0.3411,11.3999,1.8374,3.2942,3.1703,0.0061,0.8777,1.0762,5.8877,2.7232,4.4492,4.5892,2.2467,4.5485,1.235,3.0937,0.0093,4.9535,0.0301,1.1976,6.203,2.5239,1.7328,0.0182,5.1885,0.6353,2.6631,3.9558,4.3803,0.0888,1.2636,3.6677,5.2792,1.4265,2.6133,6.1521,2.7766,0.5571,0.163,4.0006,0.8805,0.1055,0.9153,3.9275,3.6244,4.4206,1.7928,0.5944,5.8379,0.0722,6.9795,5.4104,0.9699,1.7452,3.8794,0.8638,3.7505,7.4134,4.3378,0.0002,1.2665,4.7021,2.1821,2.5172,7.5772,3.1133,7.1911,0.0641,1.3648,2.6035,1.5824,5.3917,0.0971,0.9282,4.754,2.7887,6.8455,2.2746,0.5974,8.3901,4.4811,4.442,2.2612,3.5735,4.5906,6.5823,0.4179,0.0661,3.7281,0.1455,1.9794,2.7725,1.7431,2.2195,7.2014,0.0019,0.9845,2.0155,5.1416,0.0016,4.5017,2.3597,0.0166,4.4788,0.979,5.0179,0.5248,0.4077,1.176,4.4013,5.5798,3.6025,4.2197,1.6121,5.0082,0.0843,0.0514,5.3926,0.1007,0.3256,0.0732,2.1107,1.3347,3.6278,1.1423,4.3106,0.963,4.7477,0.6578,6.4655,4.2007,0.578,6.435,9.5927,0.0148,0.2741,1.6984,1.0164,4.4982,4.2953,1.3419,0.3213,2.4925,5.1425,2.5643,4.0386,5.1092,1.9748,0.4333,0.0691,3.606,5.1412,7.0123,3.3663,2.2228,6.3651,9.2091,7.8624,0.3259,1.8916,10.6874,1.2094,6.3389,3.5259,0.0139,2.9034,2.69,8.132,0.4926,0.8226,5.2734,0.0701,0.0027,6.1589,6.5269,0.7434,3.2972,5.4667,1.863,8.1848,3.1489,2.4188,1.9779,3.6355,0.5343,6.4444,1.4012,0.1817,2.5372,0.5485,1.3905,2.8313,0.4677,1.6486,2.0844,1.3632,0.0466,6.7494,1.6364,1.6038,0.1239,2.6017,3.5169,5.3936,6.4187,5.2478,0.1815,1.6621,0.3038,0.4046,1.8893,1.6729,3.5847,0.553,6.1459,0.482,4.6464,2.426,0.2772,1.9282,5.388,3.301,0.5915,1.2339,4.3692,6.2917,1.5759,2.4499,0.1768,2.0569,2.4253,0.0947,1.8943,0.9145,3.4212,0.4586,3.8175,1.1272,4.0718,0.8517,2.1362,2.6121,3.3201,1.2944,0.805,2.6056,2.0537,7.7523,0.074,0.2103,2.9262,1.0778,1.8359,1.0554,3.8829,0.0405,7.0043,5.5631,1.3416,0.0028,2.8051,5.4234,0.678,10.355,0.9291,0.6425,2.917,0.2925,0.7917,3.0854,3.7998,1.3195,5.4223,4.3888,3.1668,1.1951,0.0231,3.205,4.4111,3.682,1.4633,0.1022,0.182,4.2588,0.7891,1.4573,0.4224,0.3491,0.8836,1.7554,8.1489,1.6009,4.684,2.4445,0.4332]}
{"prompt":"A board game affects changes in the real world . It 's not Jumanji , it 's Risk .","text":"A board game affects changes in the real world. It's not Jumanji, it's Risk. '\nIn the same issue of Entertainment Weekly magazine, a group of writers describes the game as an 'imaginative science-fiction game'.\nBy the end of the 1970s, the company had sold over 12 million copies of the game around the world. Since 1976, its boxed editions have come in three colors - white, black and green. Black-covered editions have had black checkered playing cards and silver plastic dice.\n\nThe rules\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player takes a turn and places tokens on the board to control different features of the world, such as land, roads or water. All players place their tokens on a set of cards called their \"cardboard backdrop,\" which represents the location and layout of the players' homes from which they can start building.  Each of the players rolls a die, which indicates which construction type and cost to choose. A die roll of 1 gives the right to build a house of a given design, using construction points to refill its depleted storage. The cost of construction points may be increased by choosing resources on a grid (for example digging a bank in the ground using a metal blade), and by increasing the complexity of the house. Each player attempts to create the most expensive houses by tapping into resources that are not available in the neighborhood, and by building homes with the maximum possible level of complexity.\nTogether, they are required to move the tokens throughout the board, building and building up until the end of the game. However, the players will still need food as well as resources and space for themselves as the game progresses through its multiple play cycles.\nWhen a player cannot move, they are forced to place a token on the board so that the board can move. While their tokens are on the move board, the player cannot put anything on a place where the board wants to move them. Once on the board, they can place tokens or continue building the board, or they can use their resources to build on the board. Building on the board grants benefits - one of the board's three different types of resources on the board - to the player who built the board.\nThe game progresses toward the end of the play cycle, and the last player who has successfully moved their building points wins.\n\nPopularity\n\nRisk has been described as the most influential board game of the 20th century. The British Game Company has estimated that over 100 million Risk games are played annually worldwide, and that it is played mostly by adults, not children. It is a popular game, particularly in Europe, Canada, the United States and Australia, although it has also been successful in Japan and Africa.","token_len":561,"entropy":[8.9372,4.5209,11.3967,9.0141,0.3825,1.6766,6.3457,0.1406,1.5386,2.3452,1.6271,2.0683,10.9464,4.6455,0.0052,1.5688,1.397,0.048,7.4437,0.8889,8.014,4.2648,7.6604,1.6988,4.8142,5.145,1.3894,5.7021,0.0377,3.4222,0.3003,2.9428,4.1035,0.2327,3.6516,5.4273,1.5885,2.1115,0.8512,3.0146,2.7263,4.2526,1.2788,0.0834,5.73,1.8377,0.0136,1.9036,1.8174,1.5488,6.802,1.7894,2.0353,0.0719,0.6808,6.373,0.0398,0.2484,1.6287,4.8603,2.1018,2.8016,2.079,4.9245,0.2446,0.2925,0.9739,1.342,0.5733,7.71,0.1491,0.0929,0.737,5.8335,6.76,0.2371,3.8325,9.7309,1.9969,0.546,6.6312,0.5648,3.6895,4.3234,2.6187,2.0338,0.1802,1.275,0.2143,2.6077,0.456,7.0371,4.6413,8.9831,3.3139,2.06,4.0916,4.2788,8.6866,1.0952,0.0001,8.9049,0.7826,1.8194,6.3884,6.723,4.3897,1.1585,1.2846,8.2076,1.9647,6.2799,5.1232,0.0002,5.0808,1.0582,2.3726,0.1713,0.7397,1.2401,0.3232,2.8543,0.3664,2.184,1.5907,2.8069,2.5921,4.9563,5.5259,0.804,1.3108,0.714,3.1431,4.7034,5.3094,6.6141,0.9766,0.4973,2.1128,3.033,0.9662,0.0037,4.9738,0.8305,7.6239,3.045,3.3701,0.1896,5.3931,1.7443,4.3135,1.4498,1.1439,0.8676,1.7739,4.3767,0.4074,3.9689,3.4773,5.086,2.0633,4.4974,4.5213,12.4067,3.8936,0.8564,3.3461,0.7867,4.2818,2.8056,5.2847,0.0367,0.5689,5.5859,0.4532,6.1825,6.9192,2.7862,0.2994,2.0463,6.3831,3.9663,1.6099,10.0795,8.7825,3.1215,0.3838,0.9866,6.1708,1.1749,1.2262,1.6515,1.5252,3.6154,2.1884,9.5722,4.9414,3.5863,5.2102,2.4494,5.8247,0.7803,3.8278,4.5157,4.5528,3.0268,1.5131,4.35,1.1952,6.3813,0.3837,1.8748,0.9698,1.5818,4.166,2.7442,4.4472,4.6867,1.3074,7.5187,6.1061,5.1301,2.7253,9.0131,4.6267,7.9278,3.8027,1.035,2.4257,3.1262,0.4982,2.8592,0.6788,5.6495,0.6814,2.062,1.6236,5.9859,6.8789,3.3336,3.0697,4.5134,3.628,3.4737,0.3776,9.1786,1.1836,6.1838,3.3755,1.5619,3.0298,5.7396,1.8586,6.7324,6.9638,1.818,2.859,1.5014,4.1729,0.7482,7.3116,0.1078,1.0037,4.5648,1.8806,3.2076,0.7628,7.0185,0.1956,4.329,3.1404,2.6502,2.3847,5.3548,2.5143,7.136,3.014,3.4514,3.119,1.6828,3.1629,1.6329,1.8975,0.937,6.3319,1.7091,2.1458,1.7402,2.5144,5.5537,1.854,2.4404,5.2087,2.9308,5.6985,0.1239,2.4911,0.44,1.2124,24.9856,0.3779,2.7893,4.0988,4.9936,0.0728,5.2802,1.9962,7.0322,6.4219,0.1677,2.3062,1.4171,4.0406,3.5159,1.9612,3.4146,4.5297,1.7242,2.629,0.4126,0.2824,0.2986,0.3225,5.5494,0.0343,1.8265,2.9579,3.8279,3.3824,2.1935,7.8982,4.8588,0.8792,0.2006,3.6142,3.8841,5.8066,2.6361,4.4126,4.5571,2.0379,0.64,0.3951,4.9097,3.4908,6.7151,2.799,5.4659,0.238,0.9559,17.1457,2.1548,0.7271,6.2614,2.5949,4.1739,1.0481,2.5229,1.8161,0.0642,3.5971,1.7792,2.3912,0.7177,0.4105,0.7978,4.9193,0.5581,1.7369,3.2976,1.4544,2.0966,1.7814,4.9503,5.0749,1.4996,0.8894,2.774,0.0745,7.3248,7.4552,0.1089,1.3684,1.4342,5.267,4.3164,4.1604,1.186,4.442,5.3102,2.9569,2.0066,1.5399,7.8131,0.8794,0.2752,3.4749,0.5022,4.0719,4.4606,0.1593,0.84,0.1134,1.4395,1.1823,2.5271,3.0331,4.0358,6.2275,1.5437,3.2479,4.4876,2.213,2.3689,1.6904,0.26,3.8582,1.6168,2.712,0.5805,1.7197,5.1889,0.8301,0.6614,1.1364,6.78,2.2703,0.3097,0.0505,5.6178,6.3049,4.7961,4.5475,2.0367,1.8066,4.8736,0.144,3.903,4.3672,2.633,0.2208,2.0757,7.1373,0.3446,0.4262,2.0519,2.4932,1.034,0.6339,1.8977,3.8632,0.5469,2.7709,0.9584,1.1927,5.7627,1.7599,4.7904,7.1492,0.9023,0.4457,0.3454,0.5139,2.9441,0.3715,0.9074,2.2856,1.5327,5.5294,1.2789,2.7099,2.1197,4.4282,3.2047,3.0249,6.1714,4.1896,4.2805,0.7742,1.2511,0.1445,8.5421,0.9792,0.6656,0.0002,4.9607,1.0214,2.788,1.331,3.3783,0.3269,2.4095,1.8742,3.5196,2.114,0.0753,1.1176,1.272,1.8013,0.0067,0.2104,0.5755,2.4377,6.4886,4.6513,4.5065,4.1433,4.5535,0.2305,3.7957,2.6979,0.4746,10.0508,2.0147,2.2809,0.9497,3.5744,1.5313,1.6177,1.1963,1.495,2.4345,1.532,5.2142,7.475,1.4045,2.8335,2.2811,5.9477,0.1937,0.1689,3.3769,1.0547,3.1311,1.6461,0.9506,2.7337,3.9945,1.486,2.7025,0.9647,6.2568,1.0857,1.7154,0.6816,0.0032,0.4136,1.434,1.4741,4.2261,1.2458,1.2436,1.4689,0.3788,6.9486,0.1885,2.2374,1.2703,6.4338,0.3218]}

What happens ?","text":"A figment of your imagination ( a character you've written, some hidden part of your personality, an imaginary friend ) has sudden been brought into existence and has appeared in your life. Your family\/friends seem to think it's normal, and only you and the figment know the truth. What happens? \nI believe that this is known as a split person. I believe that there may be the possibility of this happening to you, but I do not have a good reason to believe it. \nI am trying to come up with a way for you and your figment to know when you are splitting your personality. This will be used by a person who can hear your inner voice. You and your figment can be in two completely different locations at the same time.\nThe reason I ask this is because I know myself I can be quite disconcerted by some of my thoughts and memories from the figment when I try to 'control it'. There are times when I feel things coming out of my figment - they usually last seconds, but feel very real.\nPlease ask if there is anything else I could add. Thank you. I do appreciate you taking the time to read this.\n\nA:\n\nI don't think you should worry about this.\nYou see, a lot of things happen in a split personality, depending on how well it's developed.  For example:\n\nYou can see other people within your own body and mind.\nYou can see things which you don't really remember happening.  (I had these experiences many years ago with a split personality.)\nYou can feel a strange inner sensation in your head.\nYou can feel your heart beating as if outside of your body.\nAs a result of all of the things mentioned, in some cases, you could be more comfortable with the other person.\nThe person within your mind would tell you things which are totally false, since if they were true you wouldn't be able to tell if the other person was saying them or not.  This might have the effect of getting your normal, trustworthy person more confused.\nOther than that, your split person will likely live a fairly normal life, and do all of its business.  It could even have a family or a job or be able to take care of itself.\nIf you're worried, maybe it's because you're more worried than you should be about your regular person; that's a perfectly natural thing to be concerned about.\nIf you worry about your split person, it may be a sign that, for some reason or another, you don't trust the other person.  But I don't know why, and I have no idea why your regular person would even worry about this.","token_len":561,"entropy":[12.0152,1.8103,0.575,4.8139,0.6312,5.2148,8.8375,5.6345,3.5502,2.1618,5.1556,2.5058,4.996,7.3059,5.4947,0.2364,0.5393,2.4644,1.1841,3.5096,5.0546,4.1218,6.0424,5.1085,12.2156,9.0915,5.9657,1.9985,2.7338,2.6577,3.4405,6.215,1.3498,1.3075,2.0405,0.7669,3.8916,5.2875,6.2857,0.8642,6.2276,0.3287,2.6266,1.8358,0.5759,3.6218,1.3784,1.819,6.695,2.0439,2.2379,2.2746,4.9878,0.1157,5.1196,3.2916,1.1075,0.536,4.2072,3.507,2.9379,6.7926,5.332,3.8786,4.7374,1.3444,2.4855,1.0493,7.4395,0.4402,2.392,7.7976,6.6461,1.302,2.7848,1.8718,0.7063,3.5312,4.3959,0.2234,5.099,1.7641,0.9181,3.4224,1.5712,1.7935,1.1976,1.4266,1.1266,1.3128,2.4269,0.0541,3.1403,1.9923,2.933,3.402,0.7624,0.6191,0.6958,0.5211,2.5784,0.4716,2.0706,2.2937,4.6383,0.0856,4.9081,0.9555,0.0054,0.5909,2.3097,3.0499,0.766,3.4158,0.8218,4.1497,0.0644,0.1837,3.0538,3.7824,1.8157,1.1173,5.1715,4.288,0.8074,0.9896,3.3132,2.2897,1.974,5.8329,3.3962,3.6189,3.4588,0.967,4.2462,5.2506,2.3484,5.1686,0.8882,1.6984,2.9155,3.4443,0.4038,0.1462,0.0055,2.2905,3.3843,3.4541,5.3121,5.1659,0.2784,5.3361,2.0102,0.5685,0.0087,0.0068,0.4628,2.3593,3.0315,4.9344,1.7838,4.9443,1.5459,0.96,1.1068,1.3824,3.2927,7.498,5.8897,2.5136,2.6986,4.8967,6.5939,3.7101,0.1879,1.1574,4.3348,0.7638,3.3335,3.2988,1.5144,5.4961,4.3915,1.5893,8.934,0.0469,4.7878,0.7949,4.5829,0.0981,6.1299,5.3998,3.2176,0.588,4.8138,1.0914,2.3069,0.3222,0.4765,2.3985,6.2726,3.6102,1.6065,0.2142,0.2502,5.0524,0.0312,5.3792,4.3228,5.98,6.2286,8.0055,1.6296,2.0289,7.8996,2.562,2.5684,1.3843,2.2558,6.442,5.807,2.4641,2.7875,0.5381,1.8772,2.2543,2.4123,2.4649,2.1441,1.8267,5.3545,0.0314,0.882,3.2093,3.8837,4.3043,2.9932,2.602,0.9266,0.0182,0.0723,1.2426,0.787,1.1691,1.5471,5.854,4.4931,4.6951,3.019,0.0137,1.9974,3.7846,0.0022,1.9617,1.7904,2.8055,4.0117,0.7147,1.9057,1.2743,2.7258,16.7013,5.3241,0.6229,4.2026,3.8206,0.0564,3.0994,2.1631,1.7701,2.6718,0.2997,2.7071,1.8767,6.0995,0.0643,1.8588,4.1278,3.948,2.0746,4.5244,0.4528,3.8545,5.5156,0.3002,3.0895,0.7712,0.1412,2.0617,2.541,3.1873,5.2041,0.2088,5.9246,1.0959,3.2512,2.4235,2.6618,5.2254,1.2813,1.3734,17.0683,0.6353,1.1497,2.5852,5.0647,1.8524,2.4348,0.0003,3.0494,3.8838,6.9442,0.9329,2.2902,5.6687,2.8342,5.2824,5.7816,2.3975,4.8859,1.3609,0.0758,2.9362,1.4149,4.0145,0.1345,2.1276,0.3145,14.6218,0.407,2.5178,3.567,4.2747,6.6833,4.8893,2.4107,0.3912,2.5327,1.0446,0.6622,10.5199,0.4405,0.9027,2.6237,2.865,1.2012,4.2158,1.1786,8.7021,1.3706,1.4256,0.1247,0.3653,0.4309,11.1074,2.1151,0.7081,0.9378,2.9183,1.1661,3.0727,2.4924,3.8796,2.8775,5.1914,3.0469,0.8735,1.445,1.1096,4.6771,2.2819,4.2062,4.582,0.9151,2.0824,4.5512,0.1557,1.6138,0.9516,8.6118,3.4874,3.693,0.9899,2.421,4.1514,5.8137,0.0587,2.0283,1.2511,2.019,4.6841,4.9803,1.5562,5.5554,5.0592,1.5155,1.5428,0.4615,2.8772,1.9352,0.0005,1.2324,0.3224,0.0017,3.0489,3.6592,2.4465,1.771,0.0654,0.5913,4.8165,1.8967,1.738,0.1035,0.1693,1.6057,2.5158,4.4722,4.0089,4.003,0.6589,0.0498,4.245,3.2204,7.6655,4.4411,6.3987,2.9055,5.3562,4.1601,1.0375,0.6423,9.8844,3.5214,0.9612,0.133,3.7238,3.6525,3.1932,2.1338,4.8201,6.0522,2.0537,4.3691,0.9118,0.2353,1.6292,1.8707,5.0402,4.216,1.1036,3.9486,3.9934,2.1218,1.1316,3.0234,4.1149,2.3004,2.6723,1.2721,4.6802,1.8184,2.3005,1.8579,3.2928,4.0872,2.8537,0.0055,3.8747,0.1804,0.0126,1.47,0.5734,0.8417,6.4803,0.6628,2.7077,4.2053,2.7616,4.9804,2.4551,0.4364,1.5841,0.6409,1.3293,4.5556,3.5918,2.7811,0.8832,2.1327,0.1077,1.1486,1.7667,7.6284,4.594,6.5191,3.4196,0.9369,2.8421,6.3485,3.9412,2.0161,0.8349,2.8471,1.9848,0.1906,0.2775,0.8766,7.8654,0.3753,4.8423,0.7762,1.6001,2.2461,0.603,0.7813,2.1988,2.1645,0.5185,4.3766,2.071,0.6506,5.6335,2.7881,0.5862,0.315,3.2636,0.3574,0.0164,0.6866,2.6361,0.0006,3.5278,2.2936,0.8029,0.0313,1.0493,0.8778,4.2076,3.1499,1.6829,0.0004,1.7091,2.7272,1.9723,1.5625,0.6982,3.8497,0.3925,1.0423,1.2008,5.0855,6.5431,0.115,1.2791,4.2861,4.4806,0.4374,2.5807,0.3466]}
{"prompt":"You 're sitting outside a cafe minding your on business when a homeless man comes up to you . He offers to tell you a story about his life for some change .","text":"You're sitting outside a cafe minding your on business when a homeless man comes up to you. He offers to tell you a story about his life for some change. You take his advice, you have some coffee, he tells you his story. His story is one of the hardest ones he has ever heard. It is about how a bad job in his country, in Pakistan changed his life, his wife, and his children to a great life in Canada. His story is of a life of pain and tears and it brings tears to anyone listening. You say, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d He answers you, \u201cMy name is Nazir, and I am a human being, like you and me. \u201c You tell him to go back where he came from, and then you start drinking your coffee in silence. You never know why you are sitting there. Sometimes there are no reasons, you just feel you have to be there. I wonder what people who give advice to others like this one would think of. I hope it isn\u2019t the same as me.\nWell, I just started in a different forum, and just saw there's a thread for the original. I thought I would give it a shot and see what happened to the old one...\nNoticed the topic in the main forum too (though it wasn't at the top level like it is in a lot of the sub-forums now).\nWell...the answer is simple. I forgot to set it to never go away, and when I started work on the latest game and turned off my laptop, it just disappeared.\nA few nights later while doing some homework I found it in some place of the laptop with most of the files on it, I had to hunt really hard for this one so I couldn't tell you where but its still on my laptop. So there we go, the forum went away (I guess) right before I finished writing up the final files for the latest game.\nWhen I found it, I could've reloaded it and posted it but I didn't want to mess up the existing files.\nSorry, I was about to say it was back in the original place, but I'm not sure it actually has been deleted. I'll post another time and let the others decide.\nI had to find it by accident, and also I thought it'd get deleted in my account eventually if I kept messing with the page.\nYeah, the reason all the old stuff is in there is because no one seems to want older forums, or doesn't know the place, so we're in there and I figure they like it there, so don't move it away again, too much hassle for not even an easy question like that.","token_len":562,"entropy":[5.2847,6.3255,5.5697,3.157,4.6321,12.1299,0.2372,0.1064,11.9352,7.2428,4.5452,1.9633,7.0741,0.4229,2.0865,1.4939,0.4604,0.2444,2.2272,1.9328,5.9023,1.2762,6.1813,0.1998,2.9699,0.3952,1.0164,1.4734,1.4696,5.4255,4.8736,7.1665,0.5741,2.1119,3.8614,1.9062,2.6644,1.6689,4.2553,5.3752,3.3682,5.2935,0.9009,2.3768,2.3044,0.0928,3.0202,0.2929,1.1425,4.8706,1.3127,0.9304,3.8317,0.4729,3.0469,5.2228,2.8027,2.7886,1.3567,0.1592,1.9683,0.7004,2.8296,1.9202,3.0402,2.2084,3.6038,5.8664,4.3721,4.0473,3.3211,4.229,3.4401,4.0639,6.7475,6.9533,0.5865,0.0622,1.8385,2.9444,4.6695,1.1875,2.2518,1.2588,2.1112,4.694,3.2986,5.099,3.1943,3.2026,4.6173,0.2701,3.9541,0.3344,0.4381,4.8121,2.1433,2.6903,2.4054,4.4338,1.0028,6.5266,1.4485,5.4344,6.6944,2.0269,0.66,6.021,7.6012,0.4679,3.0302,4.5039,1.0721,12.7249,6.4992,5.2804,2.4775,2.0378,2.1581,0.5959,1.0886,9.0417,2.7104,3.2573,2.2593,1.4618,0.5366,0.4099,3.1659,0.0406,0.1336,6.9877,1.3667,3.3221,1.8233,0.8353,1.4525,1.6661,4.4167,0.4772,2.4806,5.917,0.6126,2.5264,0.6619,0.6569,1.9604,0.2388,8.0171,3.3776,0.4242,3.8623,2.3107,2.293,4.9488,0.8375,0.3224,0.03,0.8234,1.7865,3.652,1.5525,5.0083,5.6949,4.188,0.3317,4.1485,4.8577,0.4545,2.0422,5.4264,3.2687,5.3432,1.9016,1.3331,3.5414,0.9165,1.5749,6.2329,4.4284,1.4024,3.3227,7.2153,1.8,2.4079,1.4748,2.8024,4.2558,2.4302,0.4615,2.995,1.3141,0.7901,4.1166,5.9262,1.469,5.3635,4.0774,5.8507,4.3848,1.0725,2.5974,4.854,2.3626,6.58,2.1544,1.0397,1.96,2.1751,2.5754,3.6425,3.1797,4.5498,12.1508,6.8613,5.2601,3.0531,1.8632,2.1361,3.6601,0.7504,1.7484,9.5457,0.5775,2.0565,4.6651,4.6956,5.246,2.5337,2.8655,7.9542,1.5986,1.436,5.5583,4.5811,5.5933,2.782,1.0135,3.6481,3.5864,2.6855,6.4336,3.5964,1.5755,3.1064,1.8826,1.9745,3.2418,0.7553,0.1467,1.6208,2.5592,1.9808,0.7872,3.1882,3.7972,2.4305,5.1689,2.5483,6.2311,1.5054,6.2892,7.7566,3.2455,4.7902,3.5555,1.2176,4.8277,1.054,5.1941,4.9999,4.8838,2.2358,3.3512,0.0069,5.0204,1.3622,2.4692,5.2862,5.4626,2.4392,2.4534,2.1001,4.3404,1.0673,0.017,2.3006,5.3574,2.3085,0.2095,6.058,1.2414,1.7137,3.8926,3.4954,5.5016,4.8426,0.8173,4.277,0.8816,2.0754,7.1189,0.9835,4.9252,2.8115,2.1365,8.5437,4.7263,4.9777,1.7548,1.6946,4.2103,0.4119,3.4068,7.5036,1.2398,1.5046,6.0547,4.018,4.3122,6.9413,2.3299,1.6198,4.0771,1.2274,1.9326,3.2403,3.2872,0.6773,2.2399,5.1282,1.8077,5.7756,1.1571,6.9632,4.3524,1.6367,4.6217,1.8199,2.786,2.3169,2.335,5.4689,4.9382,5.2079,1.0586,6.9228,4.8386,7.5332,0.2148,0.3102,3.3757,2.8212,0.1907,1.8664,3.1199,3.5562,1.283,8.6121,9.9844,0.3019,1.4171,4.7683,1.638,4.7955,0.1926,4.8894,0.003,4.5997,2.2449,2.1348,6.0385,5.8236,3.3951,4.198,2.5192,1.8904,0.6759,2.7717,5.4069,4.7536,1.0919,1.897,2.6683,7.8917,4.919,1.5427,4.6203,2.5158,3.1523,3.5916,5.7881,2.8183,0.6768,3.4078,2.8265,3.2662,1.0144,4.6684,6.4198,2.0658,0.6884,3.6791,0.5323,0.7005,0.9604,4.7943,0.356,3.2935,1.7009,1.2302,0.6599,4.7592,6.7024,9.429,0.0682,1.4473,1.7912,5.6365,0.7139,4.2044,0.8144,1.8994,0.0055,1.1276,0.2969,3.8125,1.6639,1.0771,6.9882,2.8705,1.5118,2.2599,6.0354,1.9628,1.0725,2.7334,5.7751,0.2579,3.6221,2.6187,3.3956,5.9736,2.372,1.0332,3.338,3.7769,1.4084,0.6945,1.1709,3.0538,1.6563,0.7769,3.8963,4.1317,4.2987,2.1932,3.964,0.8578,1.944,3.5244,2.9439,4.4264,3.6701,4.3927,3.5536,3.9454,4.7275,2.8551,0.9249,0.6395,1.8816,4.1511,1.6887,3.4883,2.4997,4.3172,2.2678,1.2872,2.2231,5.6903,2.7549,4.0625,1.7366,3.7964,5.117,2.3405,3.3544,2.9524,5.2831,8.3382,4.7089,0.4452,4.282,4.8024,1.6128,1.7354,6.1914,1.1826,1.1903,6.3468,0.4556,3.383,4.7624,7.0581,1.4268,2.9272,2.2406,1.8932,3.3347,0.9821,0.7068,0.3798,6.2018,0.2642,4.7403,0.0415,3.6658,9.8102,8.1054,2.7596,3.3749,7.2379,0.0009,3.3471,3.2114,5.085,2.0532,1.8267,4.4195,2.8648,4.8079,4.5913,2.9779,3.1155,6.7485,3.6742,5.9299,0.9892,4.1516,2.257,1.9746,6.1642,0.0013,6.2844,0.9998,4.318,6.4433,2.7804,5.9538,2.8861,4.0063,3.4368,6.5884,4.3327,5.0898,5.602,5.8514,4.0358,0.9696,0.2835]}

I am back to 1985. I go to a movie and the movie had been cancelled. the director decides to make a movie that the actors has to watch while on set. He is doing this to make them act better. He lets himself get the actors drunk.The movie is a big movie. I decide to be the movie star and pretend to be dead. I do this because I would like a role in the movie. I am playing a dead actor. I act. I have a lot of fun. I return to the present. I am playing an old-timey movie. The director has been waiting for me to come back and film. I can hear this from the other side. I can hear him say you have to stay out of this one or your job is done. I can hear him say that he is going to kill me. I get off the set. He is watching me in the car. I think. I am going to do the job. I kill the driver. I walk into the parking lot on the spot. I see the whole crew. I kill them all in cold blood and they die in the parking lot. I call the police at the scene of the crime. I have no idea what happened. I go to the house. the old man is coming out. He gives me the gun he used. He says he gave this to me when he sold the camera. I go back to the time machine and try to get it working. It works. I go back home. I am in the other world. I am really happy from what i had experienced. I go back to the present and my family is waiting for me. They see me and call the ambulance. When the ambulance comes I am dead. In the other world. My sister gives me a good death certificate. I have to get back to work. I go into the morgue. My family is crying over me. They see me. I am dead. I try to go back to the time machine. It is not working. I am looking into the box. My family is crying. They try to cheer me up. I get on the time machine. The movie is now playing. I watch some of the movie and then they start shooting at me. I put out my hand. I draw them apart. I shoot them. They are all dead. I go back to my own body and get into bed.

In a fantasy world, the story will be different and there will be more twists and changes that will make you want to watch it again and again.\nDawn Aubrey, who died Tuesday, was a former senior editor at Esquire and was the editor of the film and television magazine.\nAccording to a tribute posted on the Esquire website, Aubrey was an accomplished reporter and editor whose work was consistently \u201cbrilliant.\u201d\nShe was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 but kept working, Aubrey\u2019s family said in the tribute, which added that she suffered a sudden episode of the illness in February and died this February.","token_len":563,"entropy":[3.4603,9.3698,1.1223,0.6671,3.2959,4.8313,9.0616,1.7817,0.3688,7.8509,3.4504,0.9133,4.8704,1.3407,1.1407,1.9747,6.7652,5.2556,0.6076,4.3648,3.3661,1.1267,7.8619,3.815,1.5827,6.938,3.608,2.0332,6.4023,0.194,6.0903,0.8774,1.546,4.8577,0.3544,2.8546,2.9038,1.6711,3.234,1.9551,1.8289,0.5861,5.1034,3.7553,1.2584,7.8029,0.888,3.7725,2.8256,0.9067,2.4409,5.8255,0.6481,3.9436,3.7038,3.1683,0.8619,4.665,0.9982,1.8269,2.8092,0.4088,4.3652,5.3839,1.5244,7.251,1.415,4.4563,1.7157,4.583,16.2912,7.5758,1.0057,5.4253,3.1226,2.137,1.7174,4.0053,1.8598,4.0546,5.4641,4.6768,0.7751,2.7636,4.5478,0.6888,5.3108,4.824,7.0031,6.1707,1.3175,6.1327,4.3657,0.8412,1.1498,6.8354,0.914,1.7744,3.2161,2.9188,4.4813,0.1297,0.0086,0.0019,1.5421,6.1689,6.5154,2.6805,2.4248,4.4936,1.5141,3.9733,0.0122,3.5267,1.2267,0.0299,6.4829,1.1895,9.01,0.0042,0.9707,5.0634,0.9386,5.6802,1.9469,2.8283,2.7921,0.7169,0.3347,1.0487,3.8884,1.8034,3.3955,1.0707,6.2653,1.1887,6.2598,1.1677,5.6879,0.166,0.3752,0.0279,4.4775,0.1226,0.0557,6.8234,7.6283,0.9198,2.948,7.6749,5.4513,2.1942,3.1425,7.4967,1.2756,3.9931,1.4733,0.1176,5.0828,2.0814,2.9834,5.6408,2.1078,0.6881,2.0443,2.5722,1.2196,0.3031,1.7955,1.8022,1.0869,3.1818,6.9265,1.4012,2.8487,5.1824,0.1412,0.3161,1.5434,7.1112,1.3416,2.1699,0.9273,6.5623,1.978,5.795,0.389,2.1405,1.0928,0.2699,0.2061,2.665,2.6115,4.1087,0.2949,0.8763,1.2965,2.8586,6.6027,0.9124,1.2554,3.9487,2.4499,2.1834,2.029,2.725,3.1514,6.5529,3.1711,6.2488,6.2071,8.8375,1.1272,3.3192,3.565,0.9668,5.9172,0.1745,1.977,1.4801,0.9283,4.6323,1.9779,4.2097,9.1969,1.2891,1.6478,5.1761,3.7888,1.2604,1.1238,2.1072,2.6993,4.8076,2.281,2.3553,1.8276,0.29,3.8771,5.9014,2.4181,1.1964,3.9299,2.3227,5.5603,0.0943,3.112,0.9115,5.4477,0.5266,0.5393,3.9505,2.66,0.3288,2.336,6.203,3.5644,1.4116,1.3097,1.7441,0.1137,1.4376,1.428,1.933,1.4351,2.2335,2.8585,0.657,1.9729,7.7747,1.0625,5.6735,9.4067,5.2061,4.4455,3.7984,6.7733,5.0358,3.7944,5.4172,5.005,2.342,4.1368,6.8752,2.1609,5.2315,1.0924,4.5509,1.791,3.1009,3.2017,1.9161,3.3572,1.8452,0.945,4.6545,3.607,4.865,0.7928,4.8089,1.0235,3.681,1.9053,0.1409,0.7664,8.2739,0.3738,4.3674,1.6962,1.9574,5.5154,4.746,1.1352,8.1857,1.8428,0.6204,1.3435,4.6618,0.8642,1.739,3.1429,0.3226,0.2844,0.1162,1.6923,1.9436,6.9573,1.7956,0.0992,1.5954,6.8941,0.6602,2.5729,3.9061,0.0754,0.1359,3.9594,3.0459,3.0892,3.869,6.6261,0.0458,0.3858,4.4153,3.6102,0.1698,3.9453,1.5607,0.139,3.5797,6.7785,0.913,0.8079,0.5969,0.1007,0.4832,1.1884,1.6924,1.3091,2.8318,1.4557,2.1936,1.7421,2.5567,0.3521,1.1555,5.9793,3.1465,9.0135,3.1806,0.366,1.0889,1.8202,0.262,0.5566,0.633,0.4399,1.397,4.6972,3.3843,0.2595,0.1712,1.5375,1.5721,0.7954,2.2568,3.2371,1.2818,2.3412,2.9414,2.1214,1.0041,3.4457,0.3923,2.2666,0.1814,0.2476,2.0996,5.284,0.6499,5.9349,1.1192,0.9563,2.419,1.6372,1.5058,4.3271,4.0656,0.8556,2.7449,0.2283,0.0151,1.9573,2.1192,4.62,5.4288,0.4836,0.8868,0.4125,4.6085,0.5169,3.6214,5.2638,2.0004,1.5848,1.4476,1.3662,4.2615,0.9898,0.7923,4.8811,3.3411,0.5381,0.0245,0.0647,3.6326,3.6612,3.1951,0.9384,3.4623,1.4302,2.3989,0.7721,0.1619,2.8274,2.13,0.3989,5.9305,3.2472,1.4725,2.2006,2.2556,1.7818,0.0322,1.2194,1.6554,1.4958,2.1759,0.04,0.139,1.2643,5.3719,5.3936,11.1295,0.4824,3.3552,3.8371,7.5198,7.924,1.016,1.6164,1.4388,5.9057,6.2354,4.2293,1.2785,7.4493,0.0286,1.7642,2.5553,1.9497,1.7581,1.0224,1.3637,5.7742,3.9424,3.543,2.5267,1.8785,2.3194,5.7927,0.0037,2.9998,8.7361,3.7251,0.4571,1.5956,3.3086,0.0003,0.4458,0.3416,0.7034,0.0006,1.346,2.8213,3.7784,4.8874,1.0874,2.6074,4.6126,1.5061,2.2908,7.0271,11.8394,4.7601,8.901,0.258,0.0004,2.2687,9.3298,6.7091,1.4733,3.1891,1.2198,6.8843,0.0738,2.1381,0.7911,4.0275,4.3927,4.6057,2.4911,3.6089,13.2748,0.0012,6.5768,0.6678,1.3898,2.4282,1.8222,1.4612,2.6969,1.3005,2.8376,2.6725,4.528,0.9044,0.9346,4.867,2.4322,5.5928,7.226,0.2417,4.3872,2.7237,2.096,3.4413,3.6827,2.9203,4.6571,6.1799,0.3314]}
{"prompt":"Due to a prophetic mix-up , the hero ends up with a weapon of darkness , and the villain gets one of light .","text":"Due to a prophetic mix-up, the hero ends up with a weapon of darkness, and the villain gets one of light. In the end the hero gets what he bargained for; in a battle against time himself \u2013 and a fight is a fight. And the darkness is revealed for what it truly is, and the villain gets what it truly is ; vengeance.\nSo much for what I think should be in a movie about evil. To the viewers who think such a movie should be like this, I say \u201cYes! Go ahead, take our time to find out about the evil character\u2019s plans and why he did what he did ; and read the book too. But why did you think a movie was needed? \u201d I said before, a movie should be an entertaining movie. But it should not be meant to say all that can be said about the world. And that was the big problem at first and still is, the people who write and make movies will write and make movies about our world and in our world only, but not necessarily about the one they are trying to change by making a movie.\nI\u2019m not against the hero having his own private demons \u2013 I\u2019m not against the viewer having his own private demons \u2013 I think both are perfectly normal. The problem is we think and write what we want not what the viewers want. Or we think we know what the viewers want and then write a movie that shows us what we wanted. We don\u2019t think we know what the viewers want and instead think we should put our own private demons to light and present them as the truth.\nBecause as I said before, it\u2019s a movie, and movies are not truth. So what is the big deal if the movie is right or wrong? Just because a movie isn\u2019t true doesn\u2019t mean we mustn\u2019t watch it. Just like any book, every movie tells a story. The story is usually true to the writer\u2019s point of view, but it might not be true to the viewer\u2019s point of view.\nThe movie can try to convince you that one man\u2019s war is good because people\u2019s lives are saved. But the movie cannot convince you that one man\u2019s war is good with people\u2019s lives. A movie is trying to convince the viewer that the man\u2019s war is good. But even if the movie has its whole force in convincing you that it really is a good movie and the man\u2019s war is the true \u201cWar on Terror\u201d, I\u2019m still not satisfied : If it\u2019s a good movie, there can\u2019t be any other good movies!","token_len":563,"entropy":[2.0517,2.7244,12.2981,10.7998,1.7728,0.0129,1.0924,1.6836,8.0389,6.537,0.0249,2.7186,1.0606,5.6026,2.4785,6.3068,1.6485,1.8586,1.9359,3.1567,4.011,4.4994,2.1579,8.2134,2.3628,3.588,1.2986,1.6783,3.3415,1.843,3.0119,3.7316,0.4635,5.8297,0.0165,0.0109,3.9865,5.3689,2.7865,5.3988,2.6225,5.6166,6.6965,7.263,2.4332,3.5201,5.0221,7.7408,3.5122,1.3142,1.1331,3.3422,2.5322,5.4257,1.5473,5.6739,4.9909,2.4339,0.0673,2.0416,0.0575,1.8318,1.3991,1.5224,4.1687,2.6346,0.7108,3.7021,2.1765,1.1521,10.9948,9.8693,1.3121,1.0755,5.2693,4.6368,0.7886,4.5258,3.1097,3.6882,5.7553,0.4966,3.5594,3.3757,3.4108,1.4789,4.0197,0.8536,5.6587,3.4929,6.8193,2.3259,4.4344,5.7465,1.1836,1.0952,2.3713,0.5903,5.3997,3.4921,1.0171,1.3994,1.6767,10.9621,6.4568,6.2908,2.6085,6.6924,2.0098,1.6456,4.0742,5.7881,2.6799,2.5533,3.3285,0.4366,3.8611,1.7193,5.0894,6.0619,8.7559,7.3177,7.2807,7.8583,1.853,4.6888,2.2594,4.402,0.7003,0.0242,0.0216,6.4209,1.4913,5.271,1.9602,3.6077,6.2845,0.8227,3.6953,6.2124,3.1045,3.0938,3.2254,4.7341,1.4067,4.4698,4.1657,1.3322,4.5685,4.2708,3.7996,5.576,5.2314,1.8615,4.9854,0.879,2.6821,0.9419,4.1952,4.5691,4.0305,0.8998,2.9457,2.7877,3.1248,1.8184,0.4205,6.8435,0.2438,6.5893,5.1547,1.7635,5.667,0.4992,0.5687,0.9696,1.6512,4.1575,1.75,3.2971,2.5804,4.0273,1.7737,4.5917,2.125,4.998,5.1846,4.8296,4.6089,0.3547,2.6826,3.6126,5.2983,1.189,3.8539,2.6198,2.5558,0.9719,4.7379,4.4216,1.81,0.2898,0.4198,3.2248,6.3434,1.5873,2.1467,5.7494,2.425,1.3778,6.8042,2.7482,2.9017,3.0283,4.243,1.7739,1.5922,6.059,3.9705,2.2653,2.7032,0.011,5.8212,5.2749,2.6662,1.8491,0.5623,1.7948,1.6973,2.8117,12.4855,5.0513,0.5534,1.4241,5.1028,1.9194,6.0998,5.1453,2.4562,1.9916,6.0529,4.7187,4.3787,1.7618,2.6769,0.1892,0.2413,1.3082,0.3721,0.9307,6.9824,2.0692,1.2279,0.058,2.536,0.1179,1.8741,1.5431,3.5437,6.828,1.5737,5.7778,5.0644,1.1592,2.9851,3.2239,0.6984,3.4016,4.8358,5.6145,3.3046,5.1805,0.3076,0.5276,7.2963,0.6191,3.0565,3.761,0.1852,0.8155,5.9099,1.7963,0.6818,2.4789,4.3407,0.605,1.5685,1.2459,0.0903,1.665,3.3717,3.1098,4.0948,1.1633,1.42,4.0856,1.5112,0.6524,1.1809,5.2949,1.215,2.6713,1.9067,2.6264,1.561,0.0064,3.2114,1.3638,0.4666,0.1933,0.6014,0.4471,0.1,1.4728,6.4683,3.5347,0.5669,6.0967,4.5824,2.0921,2.0347,4.7016,0.0947,1.9776,8.5512,2.0113,6.6264,1.8518,1.2743,3.06,3.4499,0.7752,1.1974,5.2143,4.5617,1.8999,0.6212,1.2506,0.3193,3.1518,3.2551,0.2579,0.1179,2.3622,2.1383,2.2523,1.5034,6.1071,0.7762,2.5047,8.3745,1.7568,4.3736,2.6177,2.0929,1.3303,4.6251,1.3177,3.1685,1.8657,1.8419,1.1974,6.407,2.3864,0.5179,0.7289,6.6699,1.586,1.8673,0.4113,3.9342,1.2816,0.458,0.08,2.8336,1.298,0.3202,0.1124,0.0019,0.0592,3.252,3.8864,6.8664,0.2129,0.5626,0.0282,4.1511,0.2534,0.9286,5.0296,4.4217,3.1516,4.8406,1.8753,3.6946,1.7999,4.7784,1.5474,0.2294,1.0939,2.8071,2.8015,1.5478,6.2519,4.1878,3.1848,1.9008,5.6162,5.0118,0.0299,0.0782,2.1891,0.0439,0.0043,1.3967,1.2642,2.3611,4.3401,0.7821,0.6586,0.6457,0.2043,0.4796,1.1595,3.0923,0.0043,0.0187,0.3841,0.0048,0.0002,0.4225,1.8451,2.8377,2.161,4.3007,6.8101,0.3114,4.8706,0.9232,0.8061,5.3766,5.4609,4.3201,0.0452,0.0639,5.0016,0.8239,3.4392,3.3584,6.2312,6.5526,0.013,0.7572,4.8171,0.6387,3.5908,2.3651,1.3215,2.1822,0.623,3.7688,1.5608,0.1074,0.1966,2.2057,0.1129,1.4102,0.0049,0.0211,0.2553,0.108,1.2371,7.5949,3.9773,2.1521,0.0042,0.018,0.474,1.2696,4.6397,0.5726,1.9821,6.1465,0.0378,1.0688,3.9714,0.3785,0.3854,2.1205,4.2907,1.8342,0.0064,0.016,0.2255,0.2221,0.5051,2.4874,2.7383,4.3867,0.5348,1.2325,0.3196,4.256,3.9067,7.1306,8.0229,3.461,8.717,0.5666,0.6217,2.1723,4.9381,0.2936,2.5571,2.316,0.1718,3.8779,2.6148,3.5489,0.3924,0.003,0.0011,0.1152,0.2015,5.164,3.5827,11.2277,3.1116,6.202,5.0718,0.6324,2.2416,5.5314,1.9984,3.9027,2.5898,0.0786,0.0458,3.301,1.1557,3.9378,7.7535,6.1516,2.7369,2.1513,0.051,0.0083,2.0445,0.9081,0.06,0.6907,4.5463,3.6435,1.0285,0.2853,0.5233,0.2023,1.3715,3.1034,3.142,2.4912,6.7754]}

They are not real. How do you live with something so negative. They are not real. How do you live with that. They are not real. How do you live with something so negative.\nAnd of course we do. I have found in the past that they do not last forever. What have I learnt on them now. They are not real. How do I live with them now. They are not real. How do I live with them now.\nAnd this has brought me to where I am today. And yes I\u2019ve had to get very comfortable with not having something we have always relied upon. And yes I have had to say good bye to so many of the things I have always used as a basis for my life. These things have been invaluable to me and my life and I have learned that there is nothing more important to me now than my own sanity.\nAnd so, to sum it all up. I have learnt to say no. I have learnt to ask questions. I have learnt to speak up. And most of all I have learnt to live. And today I have found myself with far too much to do. So what am I going to do? I am going to work out what I have to work out. Then work through it. And just as much as I need to get it behind me now, I need to take a moment and reflect and see. To see what my fears are. To see what my fears mean. And just as importantly to see what my life can be if I do what I want. And to see if my goals are now what they should be. The biggest questions are. Do you think you will be happy? Do you love what you do? Do you have the confidence to follow these dreams?\nAnd if you have any or all of these questions, it is time to stop and really think about it. It is time to reflect. And I promise you tomorrow will be a different day.\nThat\u2019s all for this video, I was just going to write for a while, but this one has worked out better. The question is. Are you ready to live life to the fullest in 2021?\nThis beautiful 4 bed and 2 bath home is ready for a new owner!

Alex has some health problems and his parents have decided, on his behalf, to go to a family clinic for medical treatment. Alex goes to visit his family doctor who has a strange secret of his own. The Doctor\u2019s wife is a young and beautiful woman. On one of the later visits to the clinic Alex meets the very sexy woman. She has come to see her sister and she is a doctor as well. The doctor is a woman of high standard and it seems inevitable that at the clinic, the young man will have to take her on one day. He is very much attracted to her and she seems to be too.

Find out in this exciting book by First Chapter\u2019s author, Joe Hatch. Goodreads members who liked Doctors Wives Series: Doctors Wives & Doctors Wives: Sex on the Medical Level will also like:\nAs with the book Doctors Wives, First Chapter also has their version of The Secret which they describe as \u201cThe most compelling book you will have read. It completely and utterly blew away all of the other books I have read, in terms of the way it has changed my life\u2026\u201d It has a rating of 3.5\/5 stars out of almost 4,000 reviews. This book is not just about the new business in your life but about how you can use your talents to create new careers, new friends, new relationships and of course new lives for yourself. The Secret is not about changing your life for the better but it is certainly something that all of us think about when we start doing something new that we are excited by. The secret is just as interesting from a spiritual point of view and it is something that changes lives forever. It is a very powerful book with a lot to say. You might find it impossible to put down to read because every sentence of the book has a purpose and is full of meaning. As with other books of the series, this book includes some humor as well. Alex goes up against many challenges but he has the help of his friends as well as a lot of love for his family. The writer has written another novel which I am sure will cause quite a stir\u2026","token_len":563,"entropy":[7.6704,8.0225,4.7462,5.0699,7.0538,16.3005,2.1123,6.522,6.0563,8.4885,4.0816,9.2196,4.7127,6.3705,3.2432,6.0192,4.9816,6.2413,6.7659,3.1941,5.5574,3.2939,7.6034,3.568,2.9358,5.693,0.1982,1.3983,3.4687,1.7672,3.2649,7.6332,2.3474,1.5554,1.2322,8.0067,1.7478,6.4105,1.6416,1.7314,5.8478,5.1302,4.7035,3.145,3.0768,5.0558,0.4284,1.9845,1.9537,5.0606,1.142,4.2085,0.4442,0.1451,1.6899,4.556,1.0655,3.0269,1.3668,1.8868,2.8081,2.6082,3.7484,1.3865,7.4157,5.3925,1.3771,6.043,5.1351,0.1108,1.4413,1.0023,0.8379,3.7789,0.8056,1.1621,2.5002,2.6806,3.9618,4.9891,2.3567,0.4779,2.0455,1.9293,5.9677,6.7112,0.7126,1.0866,2.9639,3.2518,1.6683,4.8973,6.9455,5.0419,1.5984,2.3344,0.1368,0.3943,4.5997,1.1381,2.0157,5.062,3.7543,2.2711,4.5211,1.1109,0.3329,1.94,4.8555,0.6002,4.1909,0.7405,2.8035,4.3607,2.5159,2.4496,2.154,6.181,7.0311,4.5684,0.634,1.9951,0.4593,2.3737,3.4569,14.6519,8.4771,1.7739,3.9058,2.0233,2.6787,4.1135,3.4346,1.3433,0.8681,1.7527,5.5088,2.4191,1.874,1.0737,8.6196,1.5007,2.7324,0.9746,0.9221,1.5967,3.477,2.6056,4.3314,7.0506,3.8506,2.9001,1.542,2.4178,5.4244,0.5051,2.2282,2.078,5.2171,1.7685,2.5519,1.4698,3.3297,7.0606,5.2246,0.1429,0.6695,2.4194,1.622,2.3399,2.2908,3.2795,2.5444,3.479,6.5049,1.0921,4.7038,2.0649,9.1538,0.1789,5.5398,1.8746,3.3275,2.5254,2.3976,2.3524,0.9567,1.1577,2.5519,1.058,3.5731,3.9459,2.353,3.9049,4.2316,1.3391,2.8016,1.6764,2.5084,4.4402,4.0917,0.1566,0.7383,0.6307,2.1954,3.7613,0.4509,1.1985,6.1219,3.3541,4.7721,2.2594,4.6204,1.963,0.7456,2.9042,4.5571,0.9613,1.9933,3.3688,0.618,3.0066,5.5892,2.7896,4.8204,1.4613,3.1624,3.7863,2.208,0.9682,5.4384,3.0691,4.6073,0.0509,4.5851,2.4987,1.5235,2.5674,2.5443,7.2193,0.1073,1.0687,2.1993,1.0646,2.2426,1.7447,5.3523,0.0327,0.1802,1.3803,1.1307,7.2721,0.1496,1.3011,1.1787,5.3546,3.5208,1.8044,6.5134,2.0491,5.5613,0.3498,1.669,1.8966,1.385,5.7521,8.675,0.7234,7.9989,3.3242,5.805,3.8743,4.0986,14.3608,8.643,3.6239,6.5159,2.6855,6.1562,0.9992,0.0081,5.5381,3.1878,0.9424,0.0302,2.8928,7.6848,5.2351,0.7668,9.2928,3.4495,3.7496,2.9324,1.8915,2.6383,2.4044,6.6589,3.5167,1.8434,3.5698,6.5543,0.6031,0.001,1.7211,3.9897,0.2843,4.8783,2.2372,7.7692,8.3674,0.0682,4.3104,5.0131,8.1836,5.5482,3.1241,0.2835,8.8888,5.4918,4.3808,4.1941,6.6898,2.8932,2.8424,1.2069,4.5973,0.6584,2.6995,2.051,7.6244,5.8745,1.3242,8.456,5.336,3.1739,1.8127,1.4633,1.699,1.1172,1.2984,0.9261,0.2068,3.6248,4.3544,2.0128,0.0149,2.0065,2.5201,0.8904,4.1384,4.1081,1.1368,0.3794,6.6022,6.0341,6.8648,3.5552,2.1854,3.2582,10.0011,0.5489,3.7105,0.6183,0.7307,2.1617,0.2502,3.4181,2.6176,0.0072,11.886,2.8586,1.3815,0.9512,2.0444,0.8828,3.6262,1.2978,0.8918,3.393,2.5729,2.4837,1.8289,5.5612,7.7575,4.7653,5.621,1.2066,2.3678,1.6925,2.3258,0.9997,1.5303,3.4491,1.4492,4.7111,0.6816,3.4021,3.4145,3.8121,2.2692,3.463,3.064,0.6448,0.5773,1.9878,1.4897,6.3534,0.0046,3.1998,2.8829,2.5495,0.4307,0.6666,2.5111,2.5878,1.0054,3.1359,4.2753,6.0426,0.6144,0.719,3.9069,0.2665,0.0946,1.3387,1.9598,0.7584,4.6961,4.1349,1.4916,5.5178,0.8343,0.5545,7.8343,0.9104,1.9434,0.4329,4.2432,4.5317,2.3057,1.0804,4.4749,1.3845,2.5521,2.9469,4.2092,0.3604,2.431,3.84,0.9738,4.3556,2.3967,4.9441,6.541,0.3593,5.4378,1.9335,0.0061,0.0007,2.4048,1.807,0.9179,2.8205,0.4368,7.6113,5.2941,2.995,0.3693,2.3497,0.6675,1.6699,2.8418,3.1664,0.5098,3.7905,1.1471,1.8534,2.562,1.6134,1.6264,4.1447,4.1712,3.2966,1.1527,7.2752,0.1509,4.963,2.8465,3.9757,5.075,5.6976,5.9218,3.5371,3.2656,0.6656,0.3299,2.6915,1.6648,5.1768,1.3212,3.4099,3.5675,0.0099,3.6631,0.6597,4.3234,2.3889,3.7316,1.1012,2.4916,1.5767,1.312,0.5961,2.5586,1.7815,6.5854,2.781,5.8028,2.8476,0.0236,0.7723,6.3596,5.8498,5.5108,0.5152,4.8787,3.9905,4.1747,1.586,2.9469,2.5861,6.1534,0.0623,1.0743,2.7313,3.9678,0.2848,1.0776,1.718,2.2491,0.0754,3.8247,1.7519,1.0098,1.9048,0.5902,2.0199,6.0959,2.4062,3.323,6.3291,2.9326,3.069,2.9121,2.0694,1.3271,0.959,6.0356,3.0029,0.123,0.8951,5.3123]}
{"prompt":"In an awkward moment , you catch Satan burying fossils .","text":"In an awkward moment, you catch Satan burying fossils. God smiles, says,' this will be fun!' Satan, on the other hand, is shocked and furious.\nThis little video is also a wonderful reminder of the power of belief. Jesus and Satan were having a discussion, and Jesus came out victorious over Satan by pointing out his failure in believing in God. What a victory for our Lord.\nThe world is a lonely place, I know. In an attempt to build up my faith in the face of the current trials and turmoil in the world, we need to remember that no matter the struggles we face, we can face them with the faithfulness and love of Christ by staying in contact with others. You can always pray for someone else or for help from others to help your faith and hope flourish!\nThe following clip was taken from a YouTube video that gives tips to help you maintain your faith in God and others in the midst of the challenges that the world is facing lately. I enjoyed this one so much I decided to share it with you:\nPraise God that His love does not change, our faith can get shaken by anything in this life \u2013 but His faithfulness never changes. Thank you, for this reminder.\nWe know that this is a testing time, but God promises the world that He will restore His goodness and compassion. These three verses, from a popular song, make a powerful statement.\nThis is something we as believers are always reminded of by various Scriptures. The world sees evil in the world (it\u2019s always tempting me to think it\u2019s the evil of people, rather than that of society, but we have to think critically of what is evil in the society and we need God\u2019s light, so we can see through the illusions and darkness in the world).\n\u201cO God, how many a time has Your love for me been pure and sincere. I have not kept the day of your assembly. Though I have sinned against you, O Lord, forgive me my iniquity. Have mercy on me, O God of Abraham and Israel, and be gracious because you have been gracious to me.\u201d We can always go to God for help and encouragement as we are always forgiven by God.

You have lingered much longer than is polite and those around you are trying to convince you to die .","text":"Humans have discovered how to live forever, allowing them to die when they feel ready to do so. But it is considered bad form to live for too long. You have lingered much longer than is polite and those around you are trying to convince you to die. The only problem is they can only do so if they know about it. As soon as you die, you will become a vampire, and will live for eons, even if your body is buried. The only solution for you is to have someone take the blame for your death, for it never should have happened. A very good friend is killed and someone blames you. You, in turn go to visit him and find him dead. You then hide this from your friends, your family and everyone else.\nBut you soon encounter that living for eternity is not as easy as you thought. Your home now becomes the grave, and you live like a ghost, constantly thinking you could be doing something. Your only option is to take a job, in order for everyone to believe you are dead. And you do. The only problem is that you don't really like your job, you believe doing so is wrong. But if you refuse the employment, then your friends and family will kill you.\nYou then find out that vampires are able to sleep for ages. Your first night, you decide on the first night after your death to sleep for as much as you can. You have to wake up once or twice a night to feed, but you are soon able to go for three days without sleeping. But in return for it, it is hard for you to concentrate, and it takes much longer for you to work on any important project.\nYou meet a girl who tells you she has travelled to a place where time travel is possible. As time progresses, it seems like you are getting tired of living and dying, and you become anxious. But this becomes easier to fix with a very special medication.\nFinally you meet someone who can travel in time. However you also find out that time travel is more than just going further in the past. The person you end up with you has a very important mission, and after you tell him that, the time travel stops.\nAll in all, this is an interesting game. The graphics of the game are pretty good. The music, on the other hand, was quite bad. It had a fairly fast tempo, which made it hard to concentrate on the soundtrack.\nThe controls are also a bit hard to get used to. You have to use the arrow keys, the A-B keys, and buttons 2, 4, 6, and 8. Most of the times you have to go through a few training missions in order for all these controls to work. But it will get easier.","token_len":566,"entropy":[7.039,2.1675,5.8996,3.3988,0.5849,5.2093,5.361,1.6793,6.4561,0.9824,0.0786,4.9994,4.7684,0.6593,4.0626,6.0945,1.7613,2.3136,0.0861,0.3153,3.7392,3.2687,2.0534,7.6132,4.6845,3.537,0.4263,2.14,2.4292,3.195,0.0494,1.3688,5.713,2.8712,14.0752,0.0243,6.5108,0.0612,0.9354,5.1294,9.1463,2.709,8.2009,4.2999,0.0155,2.1417,5.6073,0.0639,4.0956,0.1604,1.2842,3.6908,0.715,3.0442,3.1541,5.3803,0.3057,3.9294,3.0803,3.8849,1.784,0.4913,3.3246,1.2978,3.0099,5.6507,1.6605,0.6298,4.7577,3.0415,0.0104,0.7488,1.475,0.6007,1.1678,2.1834,3.821,1.9945,5.3462,1.799,1.4705,3.3779,3.7108,1.7031,7.7543,0.0036,2.5012,4.2307,1.6392,2.8386,2.8457,1.2477,6.9184,1.7852,2.6589,1.6823,4.4467,3.4751,1.5206,0.392,0.2837,4.2556,4.0556,3.7233,3.6637,3.9957,0.9104,0.8056,1.4471,1.3562,5.1274,2.8359,5.9462,4.5612,0.138,0.3128,0.6193,4.7235,5.0362,2.9062,4.1907,3.712,7.0145,3.4072,4.6806,6.5861,0.5774,0.988,2.5652,5.9781,3.6707,0.895,8.2782,1.1298,7.4383,3.5593,1.938,3.9406,1.9379,1.9558,0.6918,2.1871,3.6583,6.9034,4.7027,1.68,1.6541,1.1793,1.3983,4.619,1.1571,1.1987,3.9069,0.8103,1.2015,3.0065,7.4468,2.3692,6.4525,7.2694,3.4645,8.2873,4.7418,2.0484,4.2194,1.6716,3.3018,1.5439,0.1729,0.7311,1.4494,0.4483,3.6046,6.5667,5.5563,3.7685,2.6644,4.7136,1.8464,0.9831,0.9966,3.9857,4.1143,0.7517,2.2048,1.9907,5.5285,3.6899,3.4768,4.6293,2.3176,5.0132,0.9617,2.8281,3.1204,4.2377,2.0774,0.2385,0.1409,4.224,2.3497,2.595,1.8598,5.8603,1.6305,5.1484,5.1308,0.7305,2.9241,0.5506,0.891,2.4144,0.411,3.8063,1.6696,2.2414,1.2527,2.8008,1.1014,2.6291,0.1977,0.9218,1.0368,2.8862,0.0022,3.7942,4.286,2.5435,0.2023,1.2102,2.4075,6.1253,7.3039,2.3912,1.3604,4.4699,0.9269,3.7961,3.0754,0.2456,6.5676,4.2039,7.9425,0.6024,2.8801,2.3696,2.5031,1.8844,0.4711,0.6108,2.6049,0.0891,0.9638,2.0193,2.3944,3.4142,2.2524,1.6523,0.5225,7.0617,1.1283,4.6268,0.0067,6.1786,2.8993,5.3162,1.6975,4.247,4.736,3.1935,1.9637,0.7878,5.0814,5.3857,2.3534,3.8722,1.0891,5.7652,2.3842,1.8833,1.1408,1.7546,2.1694,4.2838,4.7333,0.2452,0.4459,1.0504,0.7585,1.7109,3.2018,2.0214,3.8019,0.1041,5.7521,2.8489,0.0784,0.6004,2.667,1.392,6.7999,3.0481,1.9011,1.2164,2.8909,7.1696,3.3672,0.0149,3.8217,3.2882,3.9599,1.7794,1.5851,2.5583,0.488,3.4593,3.9817,5.6023,0.973,5.4828,0.6216,5.118,1.3669,4.8306,1.8324,0.4089,0.1258,7.3455,2.2064,1.3551,2.8173,2.2662,4.5241,0.5642,1.3235,0.5024,0.0179,5.1107,2.6841,5.2092,3.9774,2.5555,0.3688,1.7825,1.5265,5.0675,1.0646,3.1112,1.6322,3.7868,0.0591,1.7196,1.8394,7.5653,1.3998,3.0252,2.2565,1.5774,8.0223,3.3719,0.9449,1.9167,0.3725,4.791,5.3828,4.2557,0.364,3.6799,2.402,1.8356,1.1577,1.5684,3.3088,3.3985,0.5456,2.9853,2.6785,4.2106,1.6274,0.8026,1.0759,4.2614,5.4135,1.2689,2.4798,3.5874,6.2228,4.264,1.7707,5.3681,3.0396,2.3812,5.1044,4.6074,5.5576,1.2493,2.7507,5.7304,1.7852,1.8621,3.747,0.4118,4.2635,5.787,3.6228,0.4337,1.3883,4.4168,2.7545,7.5061,1.7537,0.3859,0.3173,3.5731,0.247,0.571,4.5789,2.2471,0.6218,4.6664,9.0433,2.9881,3.4611,1.8057,0.4632,2.7738,2.3199,1.2625,6.7609,0.0085,0.6609,6.794,4.8857,1.965,2.5982,2.8711,3.0189,1.5575,0.9394,5.1741,1.56,4.1158,1.1412,1.9099,2.9755,3.2525,2.9512,1.2881,4.8668,0.4919,1.8274,5.2669,3.404,0.0143,0.2899,2.7957,0.8334,3.0276,1.6476,4.0483,0.8926,2.5912,5.8874,4.5493,0.7369,0.2073,0.4422,3.0167,0.8552,1.8648,0.9962,2.4509,3.4155,5.4924,0.1038,0.0266,0.0017,0.1404,4.498,3.0398,1.8148,0.5226,2.3322,4.4593,0.9798,5.0712,5.3713,2.6404,0.9754,2.1956,2.6382,0.7282,1.4384,0.2601,5.4497,2.0563,1.4198,8.6265,0.4302,2.2862,1.9615,5.3417,0.8164,3.5681,2.9355,0.4363,3.5698,1.4158,3.9817,0.2859,0.0067,0.3569,1.8314,1.142,0.0689,1.7873,1.357,4.8293,0.0514,2.3993,3.5225,6.0984,3.4596,4.7822,1.0754,0.6316,1.3135,5.812,6.7102,1.3071,2.4574,0.429,1.7813,0.3277,1.3048,0.8174,0.667,5.1538,0.2837,0.3519,3.1052,1.4099,1.7919,0.0582,4.4618,1.615,1.5982,2.7571,9.5575,4.8366,3.2866,0.1219,3.8534,5.0281,3.3841,3.9211,0.0145,0.2095,1.1978,2.1185,2.7808,5.3663,3.5914,1.2013,2.6131]}
{"prompt":"A video journalist who can see the future uses his ability to get the best stories , even the bad ones he could prevent . You discover this . Write about your reaction and subsequent events .","text":"A video journalist who can see the future uses his ability to get the best stories, even the bad ones he could prevent. You discover this. Write about your reaction and subsequent events. Try other methods of storytelling as well. Make sure you keep it short. Do research on stories that are similar to the one you want to write. Be sure to choose an interesting topic. A good idea could be to look into the history of the area you reside in.\nStorytelling is so powerful that we\u2019re all too comfortable with how much we\u2019re used to it. So you may write about writing, or a certain group, or a specific time. If you have all these concepts working in your mind, it will not make it easier to create a good story. Also find some good characters in your stories that will be developed. There have been a lot of famous storytellers who are known to the world. If we had no television and radio today, no novel, no film what would you use? Well, story comes to mind since the world is a story.\nA good story starts out with a \u201chook\u201d that pulls people in. The story also should end with a \u201ctwist\u201d that keeps people reading. A story that begins by introducing main characters and their backstories to show readers their flaws, their personality and their strengths in a way that will hold their attention as the story is going on. It\u2019s also true that you should develop all your main characters in the first half of your writing so that you can see what kind of person they are. Your story should reflect your character. The main point is that if you write your first draft, you may rewrite it and improve its quality.\nWe are taught to go through all the mistakes, and that our mistakes should not matter if we learn from them. When you do this, you will see how much better your writing actually is \u2013 you\u2019ll also begin to see if your topic has potential. Writing can be difficult for you \u2013 you\u2019ve gotten so many years of training and instruction from your parents, teachers and relatives. You can also go to a writing class, or just take an assignment from the library and go get out of class. When you write, you\u2019ll soon start to discover the mistakes you would never have found alone.\nOnce you have written a story, you should read it more than once to see if you can find a mistake in it; to write something that makes a connection with the reader; to make sure your story does not make too many errors; and you should know, of course, that when writing always correct the mistakes before you publish so that the work is not lost and the reader does not have to be corrected and corrected.","token_len":566,"entropy":[8.2727,6.9948,2.1056,6.4536,4.9444,1.6508,6.933,6.2473,2.5635,5.4285,0.0727,4.5625,2.9787,2.9178,5.7447,3.3418,4.5644,3.0987,4.3355,0.2424,6.6402,4.7404,9.0198,1.5866,5.1362,9.8503,3.6988,5.0635,9.2008,2.3745,2.7632,8.5636,2.6828,10.5666,4.3873,1.1113,5.2448,5.731,3.3625,2.0031,4.2304,4.4377,0.2284,0.2953,5.2536,2.1153,0.7491,4.2454,3.5099,2.8497,0.9697,4.7139,4.4439,2.3577,5.1883,1.2132,1.8563,4.7372,0.9574,3.1869,1.7339,0.3085,2.7058,0.1658,1.8054,2.0953,4.1764,1.7612,0.6713,4.736,3.8301,2.4912,2.0795,1.6438,4.5907,2.0728,3.533,5.4789,0.4224,2.6524,3.9501,2.6034,1.8909,2.6001,0.1351,1.4525,5.4321,1.4542,7.8883,0.2669,0.9139,2.9341,11.1095,0.2645,1.4655,5.1071,3.3743,1.2368,2.9295,18.3362,8.7057,4.3265,2.5457,3.7041,5.7474,1.1801,4.9728,3.2226,0.7801,8.9403,0.3965,1.1825,3.198,0.0965,3.6838,0.2396,3.5942,3.5957,3.5453,6.1929,0.8243,6.4928,2.8708,2.2947,4.3508,4.7089,4.9611,2.661,0.2782,1.2738,2.1679,3.1238,1.8388,3.236,0.3409,2.7418,5.9037,2.1748,5.8682,6.7155,2.4424,0.5487,1.7602,0.3226,2.6731,2.3933,4.071,3.4565,2.9075,2.7317,0.6288,4.0606,1.4698,3.4891,0.1997,0.3497,6.0196,7.2973,3.2861,3.0139,6.9529,2.9432,0.5882,3.7461,3.0276,3.0039,2.8154,9.4765,2.569,4.3667,5.2824,0.1342,2.3369,1.4516,0.0172,6.1238,4.4029,0.4288,0.0113,1.4289,2.9678,4.1458,1.4795,5.5719,1.1779,1.563,3.2578,5.0291,4.1171,4.5328,9.851,3.1768,3.4773,5.788,0.2347,4.7918,6.7087,0.9038,0.617,2.5181,9.2086,0.4499,2.2887,5.5211,1.442,4.3561,0.6049,6.9264,8.1792,2.0081,5.3631,6.6721,2.6774,3.8162,0.8912,3.3937,4.5985,0.8496,2.3585,3.9843,1.8328,0.9796,3.9908,2.3154,1.0493,0.8244,14.9676,5.7685,14.5799,1.6799,6.5778,2.7681,6.1479,3.7113,1.3899,1.4185,2.606,1.7902,5.4302,6.2048,5.0816,0.4039,0.6612,1.7284,0.8296,7.7832,1.2131,0.0341,0.1617,0.3143,3.7519,1.6906,7.28,0.7465,2.6242,1.8673,1.9189,3.7151,4.3096,4.9242,9.4324,0.2223,1.7725,3.7428,7.5513,0.1505,4.5328,5.8108,4.5384,4.1031,5.7566,1.9709,3.4181,8.4452,2.3817,0.7188,3.013,5.0362,1.7696,1.3682,0.1084,2.6259,6.0755,3.5243,1.7569,5.0125,2.6656,0.3351,5.0002,3.1418,0.4944,0.1365,3.207,6.1239,0.6897,0.3706,3.6988,5.9488,0.3298,3.0168,2.2341,5.8545,5.657,2.3073,5.016,0.1105,2.0052,2.1236,2.2428,3.8082,0.1585,1.9484,4.429,4.6035,0.3314,1.5121,0.9952,3.571,2.3887,3.126,0.0439,2.43,0.3429,0.3316,0.7014,4.9465,1.611,0.694,5.683,2.1328,2.625,2.2505,3.3326,3.2199,5.6424,1.995,1.4233,3.3805,0.4694,3.6839,3.6081,3.5527,5.1274,2.2053,0.9631,3.8039,8.8182,1.1625,2.2194,4.8263,4.5975,1.6381,0.8246,1.6769,5.3657,2.1493,6.4144,1.5695,5.3236,1.9852,3.2505,1.2426,4.6484,2.8865,2.5332,4.2688,5.06,2.15,4.0023,2.0113,3.3516,3.0612,0.7182,6.0008,1.5527,0.1586,0.476,3.8096,1.8152,3.5929,1.7175,0.3028,0.6985,1.163,3.2354,2.4229,2.579,1.9984,0.87,1.7476,4.9181,0.2195,6.9118,2.7557,5.9748,0.4554,0.3599,4.4472,5.6226,0.1031,1.7755,4.6277,1.4676,8.3276,2.7357,4.55,1.0756,6.5522,3.3443,1.0371,3.8302,2.45,3.874,4.8917,1.7842,3.2331,0.093,3.4967,5.5026,2.8923,3.2055,7.0902,0.6818,4.282,1.89,7.1471,1.6641,3.0988,3.4829,1.142,0.6692,0.9247,6.3229,1.1008,2.1461,3.2982,3.3816,3.9704,2.3246,1.9196,6.9697,1.1529,2.1818,2.1781,4.0053,3.7494,3.2024,4.3196,2.4371,2.5545,4.2211,2.0703,3.3472,4.7874,5.4701,1.7294,4.3963,0.6349,4.1952,0.3575,3.006,1.2571,0.8615,2.7469,0.1442,0.2638,6.9108,3.6406,0.4339,5.0026,2.2972,5.8331,1.4064,6.2294,4.161,0.6967,4.7075,6.7511,0.5496,1.0698,4.7257,0.1559,1.0813,3.4662,1.4112,1.1411,0.4037,0.8697,2.216,4.949,0.6659,5.5997,2.2857,0.2008,2.8899,1.6211,0.9527,1.324,0.954,2.8289,1.7471,5.7583,2.4818,0.2986,7.1202,4.7169,3.8739,3.9008,1.1248,3.4274,3.3509,5.8841,1.53,1.352,1.7244,4.4588,0.5062,2.9267,2.6417,2.911,1.1446,3.4456,0.1367,3.0823,5.5358,0.9557,3.338,2.7109,1.1927,4.914,2.3664,4.6057,5.5594,5.2771,0.1062,0.0379,0.9854,4.5555,2.6157,9.3699,6.2372,5.3087,1.6006,4.9152,1.0581,5.326,7.7384,0.4206,2.267,7.1924,1.9094,1.9203,2.4265,3.6107,2.2457,0.559,2.627,0.0425,2.2225,0.113,3.7781,5.8432,5.1206,5.9188,1.1568]}
{"prompt":"To our surprise , humanity is the most coldly rational species in the galaxy .","text":"To our surprise, humanity is the most coldly rational species in the galaxy. In some cases, there is a great amount of intelligence and intelligence, but no knowledge, no appreciation for the existence of God, and no feelings for the world and human nature. And in some cases, a great deal of human understanding and knowledge, and the development of technology to the point that has a huge impact on the world (and if we do not want, the technology will have a lot greater impact on the world).\nThe point is, we have the ability to kill and destroy each other, to cause and create a lot of material damage, and we do a lot of this unconsciously, but we do not see that we are destroying ourselves and our future, because we do not accept all these events we are living with the knowledge that we will be destroyed.\nSo what we have to do next is to develop spiritual intelligence so that we understand the world and its impact on us and other species, how humans, in particular,are a tiny bit destroyed, we understand that we are part of a bigger circle of beings, how we are part of the universe as a whole, and that all life exists to evolve and spread on the planet, and that we do all the same.\nYou have to go in to the universe to understand and accept that this planet is not yours alone. I wish I could go in to my closet and take everything I have on this planet, because I do not understand the circle of life. But unfortunately, there is something in the universe for us that is bigger than us and this is called destiny.\nWhen we understand that, we have to understand that everything in the universe has a purpose, meaning and meaning, a goal, that everything is in the circle of life. We should then understand that this world is not our place or our home, this world is not our world. We are not the ones who are in charge of this planet, our planet will not exist for a while, even if you do not want. We should respect human beings and their environment and stop taking life, because this is the circle of life.\nThis is how we become spiritual, by understanding that life is just one and for our benefit, that it is only for a time.\nWe become spiritual when we understand that the planet itself is not for our profit, but for the benefit of all other beings.\nWe become spiritual when we understand that humans are part of an eternal cycle of nature, and that nature will always restore itself without humans because we are not worthy of living in a world created by us.\nYou must know the whole circle of life in order to understand what happened, what is going on right now, what will happen to the planet in the next 10 to 20 years.","token_len":566,"entropy":[6.5755,5.7173,0.5081,11.2471,2.3885,3.9915,2.3645,8.7379,3.5383,4.5288,2.0397,1.8766,0.4318,2.6256,0.72,3.8619,4.482,2.3184,0.3834,3.9507,1.098,1.6767,4.5085,4.3601,0.0313,5.1998,2.2276,3.2311,2.887,1.0461,4.4089,5.8021,3.1709,1.1591,6.7316,1.7802,1.2116,5.4891,0.094,5.9475,1.2849,1.2911,0.4784,7.0366,1.4089,1.1836,3.4399,4.0552,3.6446,2.7761,0.3288,3.7416,3.0681,1.5133,0.45,0.2696,4.6989,1.9799,0.6139,0.0698,3.2717,4.5682,1.8642,3.1412,2.9843,2.5172,3.2877,5.5063,0.0792,4.9497,3.7987,3.2314,0.387,1.4204,7.3263,3.915,3.3264,0.5859,0.1865,1.1002,1.6635,5.2549,2.6854,6.1064,1.4575,4.12,0.8059,5.0382,6.1756,2.841,5.4604,1.947,3.5439,2.5298,4.0815,6.9974,0.5662,1.0752,0.857,0.8734,2.1238,1.092,5.8579,4.8717,0.6095,1.3491,1.9256,2.051,3.449,2.4193,0.1383,7.2226,3.2695,2.1928,4.5022,0.0344,1.5213,2.3735,4.9256,4.215,4.1779,2.5811,4.2074,0.1156,7.0071,2.5692,1.1117,1.0429,2.4158,2.8569,5.3164,0.2048,0.1452,3.1149,8.5928,1.6224,2.4972,1.2775,1.9572,1.2073,3.8842,2.5019,1.8637,0.7565,5.6882,2.5581,2.7473,1.8392,6.0914,2.2632,1.8266,0.7576,1.7618,0.0729,6.2621,5.2717,3.7767,5.0917,5.0571,1.3921,5.2997,2.9931,3.7029,3.5878,0.6488,0.7625,2.3278,1.8955,1.4771,1.3532,1.2357,2.3996,2.8937,2.0123,1.9319,1.7556,0.3196,7.4762,0.2344,1.0469,4.4687,7.8414,4.163,4.3073,0.1435,0.3389,3.5753,1.556,2.248,1.2558,3.0265,6.3496,0.7512,0.968,1.9101,5.1346,1.9561,1.3233,5.0007,5.4918,4.3616,3.297,2.1944,0.4047,12.8337,5.1053,7.6454,2.8325,9.1834,1.3933,3.9474,4.0087,1.5218,1.5345,0.7383,4.7306,0.0089,1.2418,3.0947,7.0906,1.1243,2.5675,0.9564,5.9408,1.2496,1.1574,2.3997,0.0074,1.3363,2.4867,4.4732,1.4998,0.0339,0.5215,0.8306,2.3081,3.8073,4.4403,5.3729,4.0564,5.5547,1.3776,4.8433,4.4327,2.072,1.6075,1.5761,1.1189,1.1062,1.5529,3.8267,3.3389,3.4961,3.8094,2.1145,0.766,4.8403,2.6718,0.9424,4.1596,3.8981,2.9206,1.837,4.9142,1.9314,1.2023,3.0471,5.0072,1.6696,2.9232,4.7352,0.8884,2.4072,5.4175,5.0315,1.2392,4.5263,6.0729,1.2124,0.5064,3.0404,1.4762,1.2563,5.3399,8.4904,0.8224,3.904,5.6347,1.4383,1.1868,3.8538,3.0247,0.1697,1.1179,3.3035,1.1087,3.4526,0.2589,3.2208,2.0451,9.83,0.3718,1.6856,1.6779,3.1675,7.0992,0.3949,2.8369,0.6777,3.8329,3.1581,1.3403,1.0105,5.7101,2.0166,2.4213,1.3543,5.9011,0.2293,2.2587,2.1045,4.5357,0.7692,4.0847,8.9596,0.4103,1.0721,4.2162,1.2264,4.2284,1.1899,4.0097,0.6581,3.0821,1.8514,2.8669,0.6739,4.7631,2.471,0.6968,0.1746,2.8601,1.4264,1.2361,1.3129,5.5231,2.1351,2.8272,1.5354,4.2415,4.6106,1.0954,3.5306,5.6138,1.3878,3.4566,1.6813,6.3916,0.1832,0.5475,1.0211,2.4513,4.6562,6.0657,2.6153,0.4889,2.3702,3.2682,0.6368,1.6703,2.368,3.5478,3.2936,0.8464,2.1196,0.7271,2.8659,1.9872,0.2608,0.8591,0.829,4.5833,1.7242,1.625,1.773,1.5854,2.692,3.4769,1.0438,1.502,2.5674,2.4824,0.7338,1.41,2.8596,0.8888,3.9879,1.8491,5.7694,1.0741,4.1274,2.2879,3.3662,2.8231,1.1171,4.5349,1.1053,3.2601,3.3552,1.4197,2.2208,4.792,1.9415,3.5171,6.1718,6.4219,2.3708,1.3766,2.6242,6.8083,1.3118,6.4209,4.3261,5.499,2.3431,1.9589,2.6838,0.9649,1.8067,5.2713,0.1176,0.1819,0.7512,0.6171,3.0203,0.8478,3.4212,1.1548,4.0151,4.9815,1.9207,5.1639,1.9073,0.8536,3.5438,0.652,4.7641,2.1231,5.3453,6.5303,4.182,3.4386,0.8616,1.6969,2.1093,0.5582,3.5418,1.8744,3.5951,2.8723,1.0822,1.8548,2.8489,4.0154,1.9883,2.5125,0.1103,1.7515,0.3332,2.1683,3.6704,5.1602,0.2947,1.7849,3.9516,1.4921,7.2584,0.548,2.281,0.6582,1.4531,0.5407,0.0275,2.5454,3.7984,1.9797,1.0219,1.3463,2.5247,0.7766,0.1841,0.3163,0.0532,0.7107,0.0847,4.4606,0.8095,3.5271,0.0031,3.83,4.803,2.3434,0.8707,4.5635,0.732,1.5674,0.7246,3.8218,3.9439,2.6228,8.2286,2.8851,6.6239,4.8181,5.7706,2.1361,1.0581,2.6405,6.1697,0.4068,4.4553,1.5616,2.4023,2.0609,5.6941,0.9337,3.0651,0.5096,0.6297,3.8276,3.8326,3.6166,3.1541,4.269,3.4912,0.1041,0.2138,3.2581,0.1688,0.0496,0.8627,3.4413,4.6193,2.4573,1.8514,2.1503,1.4909,0.2547,4.6479,0.0455,0.5892,1.3254,2.2784,0.2456,3.2096,2.003,1.8709,2.1566,0.2214,1.9097,3.8035,1.8701,1.0856,0.1389,1.0523]}
{"prompt":"SatChat : How do you think technology of the future will change how stories are written ?","text":"SatChat : How do you think technology of the future will change how stories are written? A. I don\u2019t know how technology will change the way we tell stories, but I would like to be able to tell stories to large audiences. For the storytelling in the future it will have to be interactive, as it was in the old times. The storyteller was the central person at a gathering in a village, and it had to be meaningful to all the participants. I would like to be able to gather people face to face and use technology to enable that.\nHow do you think the future will be different than it was with the advent of the Internet and the rise of digital communication tools like mobile phones, the smartphone and social media? A.I. will be more and more important and we are already building solutions on that basis. It will be more and more useful to use our own knowledge, memories and experience to solve everyday problems. We will see a rise of Artificial Intelligence as a service, as a product you can buy. How the companies will be able to offer AI as a service, they have still to prove it \u2013 and that is something important for the consumers.\nCan you tell us more about the work you do in the FOCUS program? A. I started to work in FOCUS in August 2014. We are a program focused on youth. Every year we interview 15 young Swedish politicians for the FOCUS project, starting in 2013 with a total of 50 interviews. I was part of that project from 2014 till 2016. I asked the young politicians about their views about the country and what they think our politicians need to do to be good politicians. How do I ask this of the more experienced politicians? By taking a look at what those experiences have to say about how the politicians should work. That has been an approach that was a big success for the youth, they were happy to take a stand and tell their opinions.\nWe interviewed 60 young politicians and are still working on it \u2013 if there have any surprises, it probably won\u2019t be to my liking. The youth have some interesting ideas. They like to think of how they should have been given that job. They think that politicians are not paid enough. They would like to have more time to listen to public, do research and prepare better. They find it too fast and complicated for new policy and think that it is hard to get information about new issues, like AI etc. If politicians are not listening, the parliament should have the power to dismiss them. If the leader of the party that owns the majority of seats in the parliament (current political system in Sweden) doesn\u2019t think he has solved a problem, the parliament should have the power to decide that he has failed and dismiss him.","token_len":567,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,5.3465,2.0369,0.6131,3.1926,8.517,6.3821,1.9552,0.4517,0.5916,2.0071,2.8449,8.4159,0.5348,2.3417,0.5503,5.3368,2.7991,2.8195,2.2785,15.9005,7.8494,1.028,1.1197,2.6561,3.3591,0.8009,0.112,2.536,0.2136,1.5334,3.0464,0.2189,1.5086,0.6643,0.9313,3.572,1.8844,0.1223,4.4218,0.4547,0.0176,1.6419,0.5877,4.4027,8.6557,0.4094,0.8246,5.2008,3.3843,6.8876,4.1314,2.2262,1.1168,3.5247,1.2443,3.293,0.2389,0.5661,5.338,1.5489,4.4606,2.5067,2.8672,1.0232,0.3995,3.8705,5.3268,0.5642,3.5028,3.2575,3.4059,0.698,5.6824,2.5454,5.274,3.4435,4.4595,3.0082,6.3609,3.9766,1.7999,4.2729,1.3342,1.2577,3.3545,3.8436,0.1005,0.5183,6.217,1.7926,4.6492,1.4376,2.8596,0.4579,2.7743,2.5261,0.3343,0.1507,1.5021,0.0109,0.0102,8.0335,2.0454,7.9215,0.4046,0.0016,1.5056,5.3645,3.4835,0.2125,7.5022,2.1384,0.6113,3.4367,10.8541,0.9305,0.0379,0.2256,1.9185,0.828,0.6895,1.4989,2.3832,2.9151,2.9562,0.9,4.4874,1.3598,3.432,0.005,1.8293,1.5342,2.5025,1.4346,3.8758,0.0242,3.6156,3.0315,5.909,1.8389,4.4428,0.722,2.2222,3.8755,5.3346,1.3766,2.8559,0.4236,0.4059,0.3127,0.0207,7.3609,0.4937,4.119,0.8011,2.8527,4.0606,0.0141,4.3299,3.8247,3.2261,2.1636,3.6729,5.6988,6.1187,4.1698,3.4813,3.5337,0.3273,3.2033,0.9386,0.5864,2.0688,1.0383,0.0026,4.6429,1.3847,3.3184,4.0126,3.2332,4.037,2.0702,8.9816,0.5831,2.9373,0.782,3.7654,6.6829,0.1739,0.6444,2.0331,1.173,3.9207,2.7106,4.3667,1.4238,7.9815,0.0443,3.0698,1.4003,5.9618,1.977,2.2862,1.8864,5.242,8.2129,0.6064,2.5178,2.2672,5.8801,6.2619,6.5205,0.9028,2.4733,1.059,0.0026,4.3461,4.9654,3.5224,0.5388,0.3232,2.5316,5.8195,2.9234,7.8347,0.664,3.6863,1.2129,7.6305,2.9094,2.4306,1.0841,2.8052,5.6713,1.9543,1.5376,6.5128,0.6369,1.0938,4.4026,0.3431,1.5066,0.3249,2.1386,0.054,0.9842,5.1977,1.0482,2.1172,2.0003,1.4122,7.76,5.018,0.1376,4.5546,1.1088,0.226,0.0082,1.594,4.4616,3.675,1.0551,1.8428,2.5238,0.0282,0.0054,1.5308,4.1236,2.4701,1.053,2.7978,1.9884,3.4763,4.4367,4.3781,0.1026,7.112,2.8181,5.1172,1.1826,1.1953,7.9256,4.7155,3.1234,9.097,7.7071,3.0718,1.8382,2.7892,0.0102,0.002,2.7105,1.9859,6.1983,1.7106,5.0104,4.7276,2.2561,4.1347,0.0653,3.5305,2.3091,0.4005,2.6921,3.3716,4.4487,0.0111,2.3435,2.8679,3.4572,4.3532,2.947,1.8923,0.6873,1.547,5.8655,1.8999,3.5017,1.6973,2.4356,1.0154,3.779,2.6531,1.2667,4.8539,1.1151,2.7144,0.5793,1.7737,5.6028,7.4564,3.1864,0.3064,0.5927,0.8823,3.3194,3.8374,4.4927,0.3129,6.1445,1.7078,4.4454,5.2719,5.0012,5.4795,1.9392,7.9327,3.341,0.53,0.8084,6.6489,4.6377,2.1997,1.1396,0.1,2.8686,6.3121,7.5696,1.5017,3.9039,1.1945,0.8763,2.8595,1.9942,3.8846,2.5077,3.2902,1.0309,4.5874,3.6008,1.2997,3.2582,5.8855,1.1092,3.9519,4.0849,2.6419,3.593,1.2475,2.1892,5.2148,2.4768,4.4833,2.9424,4.0143,1.2525,2.5832,1.9183,5.3558,1.3839,4.1779,1.2269,4.2094,0.5508,1.2768,4.1723,5.6439,5.9432,2.0921,1.1836,2.4935,5.8578,3.4406,2.125,0.4041,1.9671,4.7873,5.2084,3.0497,5.9303,4.5688,4.3224,1.8239,3.2325,6.588,0.9786,7.0445,0.6183,1.9601,0.3597,5.0723,4.2433,2.7182,0.3408,2.9005,4.7896,2.5756,4.6269,2.7318,1.559,2.5855,2.331,4.6238,1.1351,2.3708,2.0711,3.9799,1.627,2.1773,4.9062,2.2016,4.8098,3.8292,4.0623,1.0256,2.2213,2.5012,0.9536,4.5358,1.8745,2.454,6.4083,1.0334,1.6411,1.0734,4.9856,0.8346,0.3311,2.5752,1.9465,3.6665,0.6088,5.1468,0.3057,6.1233,5.3263,6.6853,2.8826,0.5545,5.7056,6.518,1.8128,1.9485,5.9074,1.4654,5.4223,7.585,1.6124,5.3461,2.3138,7.0875,5.8945,3.2543,4.8883,0.5583,2.4562,0.8613,4.5368,0.5469,2.2712,4.9536,2.6245,4.6788,2.0764,2.6631,3.6253,7.8824,6.5219,0.1918,4.5329,3.7293,1.4662,1.509,6.6729,1.6583,3.0301,7.6897,3.9874,3.1018,3.0042,1.7008,0.1321,7.5476,0.4796,0.6313,3.3344,2.2291,5.0697,1.2898,0.6244,1.2959,5.6351,5.9768,0.3566,4.8834,1.7789,3.3768,1.4307,1.3339,0.4649,5.3328,7.1964,6.0019,5.7917,2.8837,0.2011,0.35,2.9441,1.4645,0.5974,0.0041,4.256,4.2578,2.1454,8.6158,2.0871,0.2049,0.7745,1.9707,1.7041,1.0348,1.4984,0.2773,0.1966,0.0568,4.0333,3.6719,2.8395,1.4653,3.578,2.8203,4.2769,0.3303,0.2681]}
{"prompt":"The aliens finally arrive on earth , expecting to encounter dinosaurs they were wholly unprepared for Humanity .","text":"The aliens finally arrive on earth, expecting to encounter dinosaurs they were wholly unprepared for Humanity. But, there is a difference this time.\nIn the end, humans will triumph over the aliens or will they? We do not yet have the answer as to who are the true believers and who are the followers of the religion. It is also not certain whether aliens and humans will find out in the end or not. The difference of our current story from the book is that unlike the book, there is a movie version of this movie so everyone can see the movie themselves and decide.\nIn my opinion, this movie, which I hope everyone will enjoy, has interesting scenes such as the battle between humans and aliens, so that it is exciting to see. And the best part is that it is not a straight- forward story, there are a lot of unexpected twists that are not easy to take. If there is a movie that I can suggest for everyone who likes sci-fi stories, I would recommend The Martian because the plot is extremely interesting.\nHalloween is fast approaching! For some this may mean dressing up, decorating a pumpkin, visiting your local amusement park or taking the kids trick-or-treating.\nFor others, these celebrations have simply changed into a virtual affair. Most moms, dads, and kids are spending Halloween with their digital devices in hand.\nOn the one hand, that\u2019s not really a bad thing. Technology is a tremendous benefit in today\u2019s world, allowing families to stay in touch with friends and loved ones. However, technology has also taken a toll in recent years. Digital technology doesn\u2019t just mean using the internet, it encompasses all aspects of our lives from how we live our day to day lives, work, play, to interact with our family.\nThere may be the odd one-off example of people having an overabundance of spare time this summer. For many people living in the same house, families are going \u201capart\u201d and trying to have their own virtual lives.\nSpending all day on the virtual world can lead to a lack of physical exercise, increased weight gain, even mental health issue.\nWhile we cannot say that social technology has led to increased mental health issues, what we can say is social media consumption has a negative impact on our wellbeing, mental and physical health at large.\nOne study found that in the year 2016, youngsters spent more than 70 hours a week on social media. As a society, this type of activity has a big impact on us at all ages. From the mental health issues it can cause, to physical wellbeing. Studies have shown that technology has the ability to impact our health so profoundly that it has been labelled the \u201c6th deadly risk\u201d.","token_len":567,"entropy":[11.0345,7.1438,3.8124,2.9281,4.3231,1.3161,8.3022,1.0586,5.0293,8.3648,6.3589,4.6218,11.5581,0.8218,0.1993,14.8941,1.4676,2.8073,3.6433,5.8425,1.0694,1.309,4.6018,6.8633,0.1746,0.8815,2.2257,7.6781,1.2978,3.629,0.2275,4.0107,2.7528,6.1503,0.8101,0.5268,1.1159,7.3077,5.1225,1.4573,2.3053,4.0219,4.0514,0.3938,4.0051,3.5547,1.9801,1.5924,4.3301,0.5576,2.3995,5.7483,0.4322,2.9087,5.5006,2.5232,0.6424,0.3639,0.5941,5.5916,0.4383,1.0734,3.8079,1.2706,3.4385,0.6136,3.8517,2.5172,3.2316,3.2505,5.2169,4.0896,2.5503,0.8326,4.7192,5.1076,2.9664,0.5892,0.9418,4.125,0.8937,0.329,2.8774,5.7213,3.7758,5.7089,4.1055,5.5011,4.7393,0.9887,5.6686,1.1341,0.4617,6.2933,0.7216,1.6029,1.3517,2.6595,0.5573,1.5692,6.7175,3.648,0.8607,2.4135,2.5428,5.2076,6.4131,1.3405,1.0,1.5998,0.6286,6.0182,2.7949,5.0597,3.5502,1.1344,2.6909,4.4197,0.5516,0.2139,2.2096,0.4469,4.3151,2.4329,2.1988,3.6841,4.7634,0.7125,0.7695,0.3439,3.052,7.5116,4.6679,5.3039,0.0064,1.2283,4.867,0.6709,2.8563,0.1378,0.9952,1.6682,6.4468,2.4726,2.8986,1.8439,6.8834,0.6391,0.8424,2.999,3.9605,2.8874,5.1462,0.2448,0.8684,0.4359,1.6146,0.8628,2.4046,2.2447,5.9292,2.0926,8.5493,1.6746,1.9469,4.7279,0.7748,2.6825,0.5351,0.0222,6.8374,1.211,2.3359,2.302,2.1524,3.7401,0.1327,5.1682,3.2973,4.5561,3.6347,0.8784,1.3999,2.6014,1.5343,2.9132,3.1361,7.3095,2.0713,2.3475,2.8485,2.8589,3.7914,0.0537,0.0006,5.5965,0.4465,1.6997,0.7766,1.1014,5.5861,2.7737,3.6663,3.0747,3.2067,0.6637,4.8364,1.2825,1.6217,0.9341,6.4865,4.1151,1.2862,6.1651,0.0795,3.1205,5.4095,3.2368,6.3657,2.7319,3.4782,11.152,0.1328,2.8992,7.7653,0.0039,3.4328,4.7672,1.0018,6.0045,4.2549,1.8208,5.2131,0.0272,1.8825,4.1379,2.7203,4.4038,9.258,1.0613,0.0,0.0016,0.0001,0.0039,1.0135,3.7764,3.4071,1.2008,0.7944,5.3461,8.0693,4.4463,5.8252,6.1411,3.6693,1.5688,6.5598,8.0418,1.1125,5.9204,10.4525,3.1156,1.2439,1.1524,1.7071,2.0418,1.9947,6.0805,2.4469,1.3837,0.4383,10.3421,1.9724,3.2262,5.9809,1.1002,2.7855,5.1773,1.1989,3.389,0.0105,0.2196,5.1335,17.4439,7.8872,3.1086,3.4529,3.9881,1.0778,1.4014,0.3626,0.9275,8.0181,1.3348,3.5537,6.1853,4.1545,2.791,5.5375,5.719,0.4894,5.2847,1.475,1.5479,5.9326,4.5415,0.3002,3.7517,2.2714,0.2682,0.5927,3.898,0.4432,3.2003,0.0038,1.3572,2.3065,0.0295,4.1491,2.5102,0.8981,4.9193,1.6774,1.8069,4.3785,4.3748,0.1357,1.0853,5.461,1.8183,6.2221,1.9987,1.2279,0.0195,4.7589,3.4245,5.0541,2.5719,0.8839,1.7191,1.1766,8.2149,2.2574,3.2952,0.0317,2.3864,0.2742,4.6407,4.6038,0.1824,2.2927,0.8319,3.9511,0.1962,5.7511,1.5269,1.953,4.3489,0.6005,2.7491,0.3326,4.8741,6.1009,0.0887,1.5875,2.1978,1.8026,1.0491,4.0131,4.5268,0.3482,5.1215,4.9111,4.1243,2.4746,2.1992,7.052,1.7229,4.8478,3.5753,3.3996,5.3059,3.9977,0.0003,0.0112,0.0124,7.3864,0.9042,6.668,4.1277,0.962,3.4389,2.5641,2.3774,5.5202,0.5276,1.4742,3.7135,1.7885,0.8481,7.3129,1.9085,4.1766,17.3378,4.0952,7.7582,0.0785,3.5269,6.8331,4.8012,5.3438,0.1163,4.6334,3.3645,2.6037,6.2871,4.1073,0.6781,1.9988,7.9236,0.7266,4.1335,1.2477,2.6555,1.1425,6.3572,1.1871,2.9729,3.5779,0.0898,1.7872,4.1793,0.0115,4.7784,4.6393,1.2031,4.294,4.2967,0.5923,0.2018,5.5593,4.3094,1.5855,7.2906,0.4809,1.7545,4.3717,2.9612,3.7906,2.5271,1.2866,6.2563,6.4335,2.2582,4.3796,0.0587,3.1924,3.2441,0.182,0.6448,0.5129,4.6729,0.7704,0.2149,0.0884,0.1232,7.1031,1.7155,7.3633,1.081,4.5825,2.7562,0.5197,0.1236,1.8375,4.9166,2.8691,3.813,4.1241,0.1837,0.4738,5.7773,1.6925,0.2326,0.7875,4.1515,3.4091,1.9379,0.0958,4.031,1.6683,3.7707,3.7983,0.3072,10.0953,4.065,2.0353,2.5436,4.7596,2.8849,2.274,1.8464,0.9139,0.3029,0.0311,1.0622,4.5621,1.2909,4.554,0.4454,4.8094,5.6709,0.0063,2.3781,2.0435,2.4414,5.0312,0.1557,0.1032,3.6655,5.3558,3.3347,2.1638,0.6208,6.8096,2.2753,6.781,0.3162,2.6768,5.5672,2.4488,1.5316,1.2282,0.7502,3.2538,5.3486,4.899,7.2424,0.8597,0.4943,0.1363,7.0506,1.6228,4.0509,2.8793,0.0087,4.1934,1.8463,3.0452,5.2089,5.8092,0.8175,1.5516,1.9799,2.946,6.1363,2.4832,9.5797,2.1911,8.0819,1.5986,6.3017,5.2029,3.4292,7.2192,1.8302]}
{"prompt":"You are an alien that crashed on Earth . With your dying breath you send one last transmission to your home planet warning them to beware humans .","text":"You are an alien that crashed on Earth. With your dying breath you send one last transmission to your home planet warning them to beware humans. It is my fault.\nThere are two types of people who know when they are going to sleep. They are the ones who know in the thick of the night.\nThe problem was when you became the one you are not. You have become a vampire, and I am the one who feeds on you. Do you ever think about how others might see you as long as I am around? That isn\u2019t fair. Maybe we should think about turning ourselves in to the police when we can, but the only way to prove you are who you are, no one can see you the way I can\nI have known her for as long as I can remember. When I was four my parents sent me away to live with my grandparents. I would see her almost every day until I left my home town.\nOne day when she walked past me on the street all of a sudden everything stopped. I found myself gazing into her face.\nI would never be able to explain that feeling of numbness that overcame my senses. Her skin seemed to touch mine. I don\u2019t remember her face at all, but she seemed to know everything...\nI tried to explain myself, all of the explanations I could think of. My parents had kept a secret from me. But it didn\u2019t seem that to matter.\nWhat mattered was that I fell in love. I fell in love for the first time. I fell in love with a girl named Mariko. This feeling would never leave me. It was like I have never been completely happy. But it was never going to be Mariko. Mariko was going back to Japan. My life was now focused on her rather than myself.\nI can still remember the day I left. The train seemed to come alive. There were people in all of my friends and family\u2019s seats. As the train stopped, I saw the same girl I had fallen for years before standing right behind me. Her skin was just as warm as before, her eyes were the same and her smile was the same. I was going to meet her, but it wasn\u2019t going to be in Japan. I was going to be the one who finally took her home.\nWhen you have a dream, you wake up to reality. I don\u2019t know how to explain the feeling that I get when I dream of Mariko. In my dreams, her smile is the smile I always looked for in my life. I have waited my whole life for her smile. And now I get to experience it everyday. I can\u2019t remember which one I saw in a dream the first time.","token_len":567,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,6.4221,4.6042,8.356,1.991,1.7132,1.5547,6.6347,1.5399,8.6171,0.2323,1.3221,6.2667,5.7176,4.3126,5.3751,1.2081,2.1426,4.4732,0.7251,9.4933,3.8935,1.589,5.852,7.4333,0.9661,3.6654,1.2958,6.1406,4.4248,1.9309,2.8519,8.5023,1.282,2.796,3.9333,0.0327,4.0116,2.2941,4.5442,5.8026,2.5741,0.7488,2.765,0.0838,8.0249,0.5745,2.4042,1.1892,1.7534,1.8339,0.3594,2.8778,5.8835,3.4911,7.0003,0.0695,1.7172,0.21,2.8041,3.016,2.0502,7.5595,5.659,3.9142,2.0499,5.1446,2.8342,3.6662,4.028,2.3112,4.6446,0.4221,1.4959,2.534,2.6545,1.6786,5.9974,2.1962,2.0775,3.4804,1.2425,2.3502,0.5391,0.6178,7.9171,1.3565,1.0549,0.2833,5.4263,0.5082,4.8919,2.2244,1.2891,2.2311,7.4187,2.5376,3.5316,0.2231,1.8035,7.2479,0.0903,4.378,1.0864,3.0714,0.1846,4.6315,5.7553,16.0165,8.0454,1.4688,3.6949,0.5088,6.0838,4.0564,1.1416,4.5367,0.4078,6.9142,2.9888,3.5279,1.7477,1.1859,2.8763,4.459,0.6739,4.1886,2.7687,1.3764,3.6999,2.6211,0.5613,0.8269,4.9151,2.0762,1.4539,6.1819,0.0309,0.7584,3.3193,4.9555,5.2442,2.4365,1.8699,0.4711,4.3395,0.5907,2.6733,2.6495,7.135,1.9596,2.6351,4.5965,7.1878,0.6501,4.1695,0.015,0.0066,0.255,0.6829,0.0304,0.4105,3.8312,0.887,1.0315,5.7872,3.8126,2.1019,3.8091,0.4292,3.7067,1.073,1.4499,0.4038,0.9797,2.5282,0.8804,1.4354,3.8814,4.1439,0.752,5.4152,0.1439,0.6787,4.1142,1.3937,4.0381,3.4079,1.7625,4.207,0.7784,2.0615,4.8873,0.4603,2.4488,2.0331,4.8827,3.6756,1.708,4.235,0.7564,0.8286,6.4133,2.7899,0.1252,0.0003,6.3894,4.5607,0.4253,1.2731,5.2607,1.7918,6.5321,1.6845,0.6695,3.453,1.2461,1.6355,1.721,4.5699,1.6496,3.2896,1.0077,0.0008,3.7292,3.0153,2.3132,2.5714,5.6135,0.0766,1.9755,6.9994,3.0592,3.7598,0.6161,4.877,4.6166,4.3934,0.696,5.9813,2.4971,1.5066,1.468,5.5798,6.2696,0.2527,0.011,1.8366,2.7683,4.3089,4.0182,0.2169,1.5139,0.4681,2.1141,2.7035,0.5207,2.4904,4.0202,6.9732,1.074,1.306,4.5021,0.3037,2.9539,3.3246,1.3198,7.8229,1.7619,2.6012,7.7021,1.4368,0.6384,0.7365,0.0419,0.6577,3.7605,1.8043,2.7553,5.2267,3.916,2.6379,1.0801,0.1079,2.1041,3.7308,3.0403,2.4496,1.0692,0.1002,0.0028,3.6759,2.8352,5.2318,9.5134,0.6846,1.4907,4.7267,2.3127,0.4861,0.5487,0.8609,7.4709,1.2245,0.0133,2.3189,1.2358,2.7781,0.1194,0.0033,4.194,1.2609,0.4782,0.0031,1.1814,1.1351,1.2784,0.0754,0.0017,1.7612,1.9738,2.0341,4.0096,4.9238,4.0249,0.6872,5.24,6.1919,4.8685,1.8148,2.1198,0.3401,0.7281,2.9958,1.6198,2.6258,2.1203,5.9511,1.6975,1.6415,5.898,4.1352,0.9892,3.3923,2.0301,1.4199,3.6904,3.5016,0.0355,2.3376,10.8019,0.0018,0.5824,4.761,0.0014,1.1759,5.0049,6.0521,0.1752,6.7348,1.1544,4.7584,3.4532,1.4032,6.0495,6.595,0.1629,2.1182,7.7393,0.0134,4.3636,0.1856,0.8132,1.3669,5.0219,3.487,0.437,1.6745,2.8325,1.2387,3.0743,2.801,2.9206,7.631,6.4563,0.334,3.3858,7.0136,1.9279,4.0415,1.3311,1.985,2.6911,4.1863,2.8293,3.6822,3.666,2.8425,1.249,8.6005,0.1011,4.6961,9.7154,1.2852,5.3513,2.7501,0.5292,3.7682,1.0931,0.9023,2.5706,2.3576,4.2369,1.7891,2.8141,1.0783,3.8578,3.9648,4.4962,1.3014,8.1753,4.265,2.5313,0.4078,0.381,3.0542,5.2281,0.6231,3.843,1.5247,2.6253,0.4098,3.3144,1.0171,2.4353,1.5843,0.9139,4.2171,0.1024,4.1029,0.7307,3.2381,0.81,1.7926,0.0053,0.2851,1.6859,2.5759,4.3912,0.1924,4.1159,0.5595,2.9967,1.5775,2.5446,2.4303,0.9342,0.0409,0.0017,2.1891,0.01,0.9661,4.2489,2.0859,0.273,1.59,1.8351,0.3126,0.025,1.9613,3.2637,1.1828,1.0166,4.6967,4.3211,1.6839,2.0262,0.2876,0.5687,4.0351,4.174,3.4867,2.1929,3.9622,0.8676,0.871,4.9231,0.0517,2.9118,4.9573,0.3574,3.4178,3.0546,0.2521,0.0218,0.0045,1.2117,1.2204,1.7975,1.2123,3.3422,1.1702,2.3337,1.8171,4.5774,0.4935,0.2872,3.6627,1.1442,2.3876,0.0018,0.6659,4.787,1.9539,0.979,0.784,5.9815,3.9037,1.6229,1.6106,8.8712,1.5619,2.2705,6.2635,0.7292,2.7045,1.7238,3.1331,0.2662,1.6644,3.3473,6.8706,3.7292,0.7253,0.0587,0.4879,1.3637,3.467,1.2619,3.9867,1.7319,1.2618,5.1451,1.5998,3.6059,0.7178,4.2606,0.3152,1.8473,2.2026,5.7398,0.021,0.0034,2.4343,6.702,1.5082,1.9744,3.3079,3.1577,4.9017,0.7003,5.2906,1.0188,0.0848,0.905]}
{"prompt":"The crown prince is kidnapped by an evil wizard , and it 's up to the brave Shield Maiden to rescue him .","text":"The crown prince is kidnapped by an evil wizard, and it's up to the brave Shield Maiden to rescue him.But first, you must get your way through the castle by destroying each of the four guardians at the castle's four entrances.Have fun!\nYou will need the best defensive weapon in the world. Use it wisely. Aim right.It is not a simple task... Try to get the best experience in this game to overcome difficult and intricate levels.\nIt is a fun time with this magical girl.Use your mouse to play and click to fire. But you should not move your mouse.It must be fixed to the place where you want to move.\nI made this for my niece (now 13) last year...I had been getting complaints from school about how slow her typing was and to make her faster I thought...\"What if I speed it up and type with my hands??\nI printed the sheets so she could cut them out and we put a piece of cardboard on the table when she got ready to type so she wouldn't mess up the paper.\nI cut up little stickers with all sorts of stuff printed on them...the top left of the picture is filled with pictures of stickers I took from various magazines. I cut up the rest of the pictures and glued them over the top.\nI printed the sentence she wanted to type and stuck it on the right side. She had never tried that kind of typing before and was a bit confused by what she was doing but she took to it quickly and has become faster.\nThe picture is what she looks like when she has written out all her words. It took me 10 minutes all together...\nAnd of course I kept the box so that her teacher can give her some more pencils (these are all she has) and for me to have something else to do!\nAfter I finished typing that message, I was so proud of myself! I was so happy that I had been able to teach my niece and I was able to keep my hands and fingers nice and sweaty! LOL!\nI love these!!! Are they a good sized project for a beginner? I'm new to all of this and my kids are old enough to think that's a lot of stuff for a 4 yr old!! Thanks!\nI'm going to make a book of these for my 5yr old - but have to put together a little template on how to do it :( thanks for the ideas! :)\nThe project would be a good one for the younger kids. Just print out the words, arrange them on a page, and put a sticker on the \"end\" of each word. The \"star\" on the bottom of your picture is in my opinion, overkill. I would just stick some stickers together, then cut them into words.","token_len":568,"entropy":[10.3569,1.529,2.9747,9.8368,1.3311,3.0004,2.3051,3.2585,1.8121,1.4168,4.2362,0.9955,0.27,0.0071,1.5076,5.6669,13.0755,7.244,0.5278,2.6543,0.8845,0.528,8.014,4.5586,0.5121,3.9087,1.534,3.8144,2.1142,5.4874,3.1912,1.0324,4.314,4.9779,5.525,5.7039,0.8882,0.1822,2.5805,6.9054,4.6034,2.0058,3.6526,2.2873,7.2225,1.8904,0.5617,8.8238,0.6303,1.6943,2.9719,9.0153,2.5826,1.1444,2.7153,6.4458,8.6705,4.9976,1.754,0.4884,3.0839,1.7349,5.1236,1.8261,1.2413,1.4256,7.8516,6.3355,3.2644,5.8981,1.8584,2.9665,2.5736,3.418,1.359,4.4723,6.9032,1.0007,2.9767,1.8152,2.3444,7.2842,3.3874,2.0455,0.7015,5.6688,5.9433,5.391,4.8348,6.5505,4.873,0.4628,1.8137,3.7995,0.8244,1.6032,4.5943,5.2154,4.1598,5.7462,6.9411,6.5333,1.3619,8.6863,1.6661,7.5931,0.8275,3.2163,3.0113,5.1105,1.8323,6.3486,1.7346,4.8185,3.3331,3.1694,2.4258,5.3046,1.5914,0.518,2.0133,5.195,5.6451,0.3194,6.5396,2.8923,1.7923,6.2319,0.9251,0.7914,2.4629,0.5338,3.7279,1.5505,1.5137,4.0976,4.6746,1.2429,3.5586,1.6097,5.7902,4.5895,5.6493,5.1897,1.2911,7.4784,0.4647,4.0013,3.8155,3.4135,3.6288,5.3231,5.8229,1.5084,5.7856,1.9027,2.5678,4.8866,3.7586,4.7106,1.5516,2.4055,6.0743,3.3653,2.3249,3.4641,2.0884,5.3341,9.0197,4.0739,2.2975,1.2082,7.4714,3.6746,0.0928,2.4037,8.2544,4.7576,1.3057,4.481,6.3633,5.9003,1.941,8.7321,2.0873,6.9296,3.6084,1.8321,1.0287,7.5215,1.4415,2.5073,1.5669,5.9139,5.1702,3.9144,4.2822,0.2224,2.9704,1.2889,1.3684,2.9436,5.4474,0.6998,3.6093,4.7777,0.902,3.7845,4.4158,0.586,2.7884,0.001,4.9772,1.173,1.9359,4.2084,1.1325,1.033,1.4369,5.0117,3.6703,8.3198,5.2401,3.2324,5.4944,3.5763,0.0164,4.2485,7.0597,0.4884,0.3154,3.1111,4.5014,5.4092,4.4671,2.8514,0.4836,3.6549,1.2258,6.1483,0.1245,3.9826,0.3615,7.6253,2.9993,3.552,1.5728,4.477,3.4466,1.2565,2.4751,3.9599,2.1512,1.2242,4.4728,0.3363,0.2873,2.3888,1.872,3.8987,0.5229,5.3614,0.6772,2.3783,2.4445,0.877,1.2171,3.9093,1.1867,9.4149,5.7195,3.7441,0.2391,2.1203,2.6345,4.9179,0.7571,0.983,0.4103,4.8347,0.7332,2.5547,3.2185,3.9401,4.2558,4.724,3.3763,5.313,0.0033,2.1717,0.5958,2.09,3.7691,3.9222,1.19,2.0831,3.2698,3.0805,1.5545,0.5997,1.533,5.1385,1.3209,4.595,3.3557,1.1257,4.1285,1.5757,6.3629,4.3208,6.4291,1.5344,0.5854,2.7323,4.1924,2.1815,5.1265,1.6655,4.3997,0.1202,2.3078,0.3387,3.4897,5.3756,3.2887,3.253,2.0127,1.5108,0.8077,2.9355,4.7123,0.825,4.8387,0.565,7.8712,3.7717,2.7263,1.7751,3.9019,5.2156,0.0146,2.3444,5.2156,2.0483,5.6804,4.2091,2.0426,3.2919,5.0109,2.4849,5.127,0.3664,2.5938,3.6456,7.8276,0.471,5.1377,6.8635,0.7548,3.6029,2.8296,1.9131,3.0601,1.5153,5.5531,2.2641,1.3043,3.3994,5.1022,4.8278,0.763,2.2008,5.2094,0.7939,4.3231,2.4488,1.5389,4.5557,5.2355,4.7896,1.233,1.0349,3.7262,3.5019,4.3562,0.5677,1.3057,2.9846,1.3257,2.3582,1.3532,0.7062,1.8835,0.8664,1.6073,3.6644,0.2028,0.0017,5.3688,1.5684,0.3676,3.1731,2.3834,2.401,2.4597,0.0062,3.9709,3.3779,4.1068,3.742,2.9855,6.3092,0.0247,9.28,2.7646,8.2847,1.4719,1.0175,1.5167,3.0168,4.6106,8.1973,7.252,1.9605,3.8341,2.5294,5.9603,7.6753,2.3051,2.2096,4.803,1.0761,1.8288,3.4076,6.2891,0.2865,4.6069,1.4318,0.6305,1.2429,4.2553,5.2638,1.1141,6.5486,0.6835,0.2998,5.1154,1.7793,4.534,2.3269,3.0341,0.3731,3.9116,3.2078,1.1355,4.9995,4.3839,0.1238,4.9266,5.4941,2.9289,0.7968,1.4461,2.8907,3.5583,0.0574,2.9761,1.5836,4.5693,2.7687,1.7602,2.7721,0.6738,4.6768,4.6437,0.4781,6.2525,4.198,6.0246,1.8932,4.8711,4.103,0.9266,3.0033,6.3838,4.121,2.0386,0.2786,1.728,0.7436,9.0318,7.8288,1.5692,1.4438,3.7859,1.1239,3.5045,0.7426,3.2151,5.6949,6.1076,0.6174,2.6005,2.7995,3.369,1.1669,3.3041,3.4499,0.9781,1.9531,4.7,4.4285,1.4351,0.7342,3.7849,2.5793,6.6996,0.3129,2.2267,1.42,3.6808,1.5086,1.0422,2.0718,3.4157,2.7967,0.6035,1.0656,6.5996,7.4558,0.8932,0.4953,2.0452,2.089,0.7673,3.113,3.7626,8.8242,0.2118,2.3241,0.4206,2.8268,1.3101,5.5579,4.1882,1.3011,5.7827,4.3265,2.8525,2.901,8.325,3.9469,1.7286,1.9647,2.8473,4.2376,4.8411,3.5714,1.511,5.0948,3.353,3.6821,4.1266,1.4075,3.182,6.5221,1.4939]}
{"prompt":"Write about a character who has some kind of amazing ability or superpower , with horrible drawbacks . Show me a day in the life of this character .","text":"Write about a character who has some kind of amazing ability or superpower, with horrible drawbacks. Show me a day in the life of this character. A day in the life of any other character you like would be fine, but I would prefer a character who was different to the rest. Give me a character who really has the ability as well as the drawbacks. Show me the bad aspects. How can that character live with these bad aspects? What can he do to fix them? What are his hopes? What happens to them? What are the best parts of his character? How is he different from his friends or his family? How does he deal with his abilities? How does he deal with failure and rejection? How does he deal with the love of those important to him?\nOnce again, this character could be anyone from their imagination. It could be a character you have known forever and just knew they were special to you, or it could be someone they just met. It can be anyone they see in their life - a dog, a cat, a family member, their teacher, their neighbor, a stranger in the street, a coworker. How about an imaginary friend? Just be sure to mention it. Does the character have any superpowers? Do any of them fit in?\nOnce again, don't just write an overview of their character. The character must have unique experiences. How did he come to the place they are in? Do his experiences change at any point in his life? Maybe his family has changed since he was young. He has had experience with illness, death, betrayal, loss. How does his family react when he is with them? How does he react to this? What do his friends think? How do they react to him? Do they react to him the way he would? How does their relationship with his friends and family change over the course of his life?\nMaybe the character has had some experience with mental illness. Mental illness has to be the worst possible experience for the person who has it. That means that the characters dealing with the illness needs to react accordingly. Mental illness can make them angry, depressed, or even homicidal. How does that character react to the illness? In his experiences, is there anything positive about the illness? What is the most terrible part? And what is the worst part of dealing with the illness?\nThe character may be a fighter at one point, but what happens to his fighting qualities as he ages? Maybe he has just had a horrible experience and changes completely. After dealing with a big defeat, does the character have a new sense of self-confidence? Does he feel like he can fight again? Does the character become weak and lose all his strength as the story goes on?

'' You open your eyes to see that you're fine. Only, that's not Jesus driving... or are you? A little while ago, we spoke to Michael Wehner, a scientist at NASA, and he answered a few questions about the theory that the laws of physics might not be as we think they're.\nBut first, let's jump over to the headline of the day - an amazing discovery from the European Space Agency ( ESA ) - that they have found huge cracks in a portion of the atmosphere known as the atmosphere - and it turns out, it's not caused by any cosmic event - it's not even made by nature. It's made entirely, by humans.\nIt turned out that the ESA's space telescope, the James Webb Telescope ( JWT ), has captured a whole lot of images that are a little bit disturbing to say the least. They show the destruction, the damage of one of the atmosphere's structures. The main question - can this be linked to human intervention, to space shuttle missions, or nuclear weapons exploding? They don't know, but let's take a look at the images.\nThe first thing you 'll notice is that these are not pictures of outer space, but pictures of the earth. At least, that what these pictures are of.\nNow what this image seems to show, if we take a closer look, is that, what look like small cracks, they are actually not that small at all. This is a close-up of what is happening on the left - those cracks are growing and expanding in space.\nThat is one image, and these images were taken in the course of a number of years. You can see where they have gotten bigger. Not just bigger, but even deeper into space, and even further out.\nWhat that image really does is show the progress that has been made as space continues to expand. The space is expanding, and the atmosphere is expanding along with it. But these images also show us that - in addition to the expanding space, in the process, all the atmospheric structures - the clouds, the water droplets, those particles with ice - all of them are being displaced.\nSo, can this mean something to us humans, or are these just images from space, or are they created by the nature of the Universe - if so, by what? They still have to find out. But, again, the space telescope has a lot more to say with all these images.\nSo, the ESA's space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, the main question that is being asked is - could these images be a result of some kind of human intervention, or maybe something nuclear in nature?","token_len":569,"entropy":[8.1881,5.7786,0.9333,3.1403,8.1373,4.1734,1.1232,1.0618,4.794,8.631,1.6194,2.4174,2.2244,0.0835,0.001,0.8318,3.5393,10.4372,14.9347,10.2971,2.5163,4.0396,1.6701,3.4463,4.0133,6.6115,0.4227,1.1822,2.8415,1.6451,2.5632,2.3696,1.4954,7.6076,0.9081,6.9986,3.4683,3.7254,1.5066,0.6784,4.1655,7.6089,5.4532,4.9024,7.2398,0.2485,1.4371,4.8599,3.9649,3.0659,2.6316,0.567,3.4326,4.7676,1.7485,5.6125,7.2425,4.7374,0.5333,1.4733,6.5623,0.9161,4.308,1.8381,1.5139,0.4724,6.8123,1.9309,1.7545,0.4314,0.7281,1.2623,6.4808,1.8779,2.4342,7.7791,0.0792,0.1259,4.2046,2.1258,1.1849,2.2642,6.1861,1.7087,1.9212,5.2116,1.2978,2.562,10.3725,3.8291,0.3899,1.5978,0.2225,4.8672,4.0585,1.4276,0.9805,7.5701,1.5875,1.0713,5.1728,5.1001,4.8765,4.3479,5.2542,2.6465,1.6574,6.1939,0.0916,0.0039,2.294,5.0099,1.0015,3.1664,1.4908,5.6002,2.0489,2.2197,7.0608,4.4297,0.1687,2.4494,6.0375,0.0036,0.3911,4.2119,4.2345,0.0817,0.3665,4.4087,5.5458,2.4849,2.7195,2.8944,0.0033,3.7716,1.9668,0.6757,1.6634,5.4955,0.0296,3.3565,4.1983,3.7383,3.1564,0.8991,0.1728,4.6349,2.4752,4.6233,2.0958,5.3168,0.4946,2.4077,0.3172,2.9681,4.5563,5.3955,1.4906,4.8908,0.6939,1.075,3.0679,5.5838,0.0021,0.5308,1.2863,7.0638,2.0277,5.8802,2.8165,1.2185,1.6165,6.5457,0.0244,6.5182,2.1941,2.0072,7.0316,0.3856,1.7721,4.5652,1.6205,6.0445,2.4432,0.1951,4.1956,3.3102,1.9438,4.6194,2.0816,1.0601,5.3131,1.9848,3.5703,0.0108,0.0008,0.4065,2.7615,1.5711,2.674,7.8911,3.8153,2.7818,4.5893,3.6982,5.5089,0.6285,0.1428,6.445,0.1733,6.3432,2.655,2.2289,5.6373,5.4089,4.6761,5.4092,2.4456,1.009,5.2114,0.1723,3.5013,4.082,2.3892,3.7062,5.8251,6.1993,1.3401,0.9269,1.8679,8.5795,1.3247,8.5392,1.8968,4.1953,2.8991,0.0008,1.9347,1.624,0.8994,5.7812,0.1483,2.1835,0.3982,0.4458,1.1006,1.4493,2.245,1.303,0.4539,1.9198,2.2395,2.0148,1.3157,11.9355,1.5211,0.8,0.3095,0.7194,3.2645,1.5889,3.5545,5.3025,0.6069,7.9737,0.1475,1.5903,1.1379,2.6055,0.1587,1.4407,3.4862,0.9792,5.3191,1.7984,1.232,1.7806,7.6707,4.5223,2.329,1.513,3.7076,0.8177,1.8817,3.9185,4.3145,4.0296,4.4046,6.0011,0.2863,1.2172,2.5632,3.79,2.4118,2.4755,1.0011,2.208,0.0278,0.8914,0.194,0.881,3.9768,5.302,7.662,0.809,5.8258,0.8377,2.3534,2.2512,1.7225,2.0463,4.5385,3.8991,2.1445,2.8318,0.0088,0.4307,3.1636,0.4822,2.2901,7.8017,0.933,0.0416,0.9954,2.1341,2.4058,2.2265,2.6869,0.3067,3.7138,3.9638,5.8428,3.1521,0.8412,6.2749,2.77,2.7857,3.3914,4.2224,0.6692,1.4174,3.8031,2.2012,4.7801,4.9826,1.8277,2.0257,5.4464,3.3771,3.8759,0.201,2.0153,1.4101,6.6323,0.0032,1.6047,6.7521,0.002,2.3043,1.2001,4.3429,0.7152,0.425,4.3437,1.5237,4.0701,3.6999,2.4834,1.2698,6.4716,2.3615,6.0716,0.6805,0.129,3.8016,6.6943,4.7036,0.87,2.0064,1.9061,3.5892,3.7195,2.1337,1.2544,1.0963,3.2527,4.5966,3.2095,3.9785,3.8834,2.2321,0.756,2.0549,8.5459,2.0407,1.5245,0.2658,0.0886,4.6645,6.1132,4.9876,0.1317,1.0923,0.9932,2.3694,4.7602,4.2052,1.82,1.6455,1.0837,1.8853,4.1466,0.4047,1.2227,6.3892,0.213,0.1071,0.307,3.8845,4.2433,1.9286,3.1529,0.2604,4.5293,0.9192,5.5023,3.3123,4.1882,0.0679,1.0486,4.7026,2.7304,1.291,4.5788,2.5983,4.649,2.5341,4.7687,1.3449,5.6513,2.5063,3.2972,1.7985,4.7815,0.6656,0.2057,2.6639,4.9917,0.0012,0.5822,5.6502,4.8686,6.4321,6.4092,3.7246,2.2369,1.6661,2.334,0.5927,3.054,4.9143,1.9173,1.0706,2.3309,1.6359,7.2614,1.1426,4.0233,2.9146,1.9701,1.6036,4.6754,1.4874,0.8493,3.6254,2.2683,3.729,3.8277,2.9013,1.5276,1.5895,1.246,1.2093,0.6088,6.3289,0.3529,2.4011,6.5223,0.153,1.1634,4.3017,3.5708,5.5415,1.8447,0.1574,4.7016,2.6872,3.1307,4.5897,7.1796,2.0152,2.0207,4.999,0.8802,0.8983,2.9423,2.6336,4.734,0.0887,2.9181,5.957,1.2229,1.8046,3.7306,1.677,1.4554,2.3077,2.6022,6.5186,5.9034,2.0918,0.7138,0.9967,0.7348,2.8571,0.6415,3.0798,4.8255,1.8437,2.7294,0.156,1.8468,1.6298,0.2654,0.0048,5.097,0.0027,0.8141,4.4889,7.4115,5.2082,2.1037,3.2875,1.6503,0.2346,0.6284,2.2697,4.3857,2.4902,0.9666,0.9958,2.6602,1.6399,0.0221,3.782,1.6936,0.0481,2.6223,0.2797,0.9197,0.6278,4.4291,3.2532,9.9591,5.4863,1.8353,0.8634]}

You are now 30 years old, and when you arrive home from work, your 50 year old self is sitting on your bed waiting for you. It\u2019s a little bit creepy. It\u2019s the only way you could have been treated in the 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s. I just wanted to give you space and comfort, to look at me and laugh or take offense. So, that\u2019s why I was in this funny sort of a shirt I was wearing.\u201d\nI think that we have an obligation to be aware and to reflect. It\u2019s our job to be thoughtful and to be in a position of influence in how we are going to act as men from the time we are boys. I can\u2019t imagine growing up back then and being told that men don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t think they were going to see you crying and you were not going to be seen as a good man until you learned to stay still or until you turned on the faucets. In a sense, you were not supposed to be a man until you had your first period. I find that pretty funny. I don\u2019t think men can get angry that much. Their rage is much more reserved than ours is. You have another thing going on here : the age old social stigma that men are always angry as opposed to girls that are always sensitive. All those social messages were going in very subtle ways throughout your whole life. I see women being really sensitive all of the time because they\u2019re so much more aware of social messages and societal expectations, but I don\u2019t think men\u2019s attitudes get very much attention to be honest. I don\u2019t have any experience with my father. I wish I had. I don\u2019t know about other men\u2019s fathers but I am sure that many guys think men don\u2019t cry ; that was a huge social message in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s.\nI haven\u2019t told anybody here off, but if you\u2019ve been taught that you don\u2019t cry, you are probably not going to cry on one of these days. It\u2019s not only me. I think a lot of the males in the audience are going to hear me singing like an old soul, and they are going to go \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d I see men getting teased all the time because they don\u2019t get pissed. They see some girls screaming ; they think you are upset and you can\u2019t be upset.

{"prompt":"You enter an elevator to discover each floor is a year . The elevator is a time machine and you quickly realize that the top floor is troublingly 2021 .","text":"You enter an elevator to discover each floor is a year. The elevator is a time machine and you quickly realize that the top floor is troublingly 2021. You're standing in it now, wondering what took you so long \u2013 and why the top floor seems to have no year \u2013 when the elevator stops suddenly, throwing you out of your place. You crash into the street below and wonder where you are, when all of a sudden you're standing in the future. You take a moment to think about the year in front of you, remembering what happened in 2020 \u2013 and discover, with a shudder\u2013 that this year was in fact the end of your life.\nThis is about time travel and what the best possible year you can imagine happens to be the one that you remember the most in the end, but you were actually only able to stay for twenty years, not the twenty three that seem to have elapsed.\nThis post is written by the lovely and talented Anne Hathaway. You can check out her blog here:\nIn her book The Elephone Method, Dr. Susan David states that, \u201cMany things in life are far more precious than a crystal clear memory. We are constantly being surprised by the extraordinary value of a little more understanding and a little more awareness.\u201d\nIf this time travel elevator happens to be inside that time machine of your life, there are two options you have available to you:\n1) As soon as you have the time to yourself, figure out what you want to do with your twenty years. This is called goal setting. It is a simple process and one that involves making the important choices in your life right away and moving toward them every day. I would encourage you to spend fifteen minutes right now brainstorming some goals \u2013 big or small \u2013 that you want to accomplish in twenty years. Your list shouldn\u2019t be difficult \u2013 it should be realistic, achievable and exciting.\n2) Decide at that moment that you won\u2019t even look at the time. Take only one step at a time in the elevator of your life. When you exit it, take a moment to reflect what you would have done differently if you hadn\u2019t rushed so badly through twenty years. For example, maybe tomorrow you would have bought a new coat or saved more money and not spent it on a luxury.\nYou can do either method, but I believe that going forward each year you could set a new goal for the next twenty three years. (Not all twenty years, because we all know that twenty three years and more are really unrealistic for anyone. I just wanted to give you an alternative.)\nI realize this option would be for the truly lucky, the truly dedicated and the truly brave; I only offer it as a possibility should you find yourself in a time travel situation.","token_len":571,"entropy":[8.4988,4.0495,6.0297,2.8479,6.6113,8.0947,2.1224,2.0158,2.1298,9.0696,4.4856,2.519,3.4773,2.1222,3.1321,6.201,1.0588,2.6147,2.4251,7.5707,3.7488,0.7699,2.136,5.5137,0.5147,0.6692,11.9125,3.6939,16.3165,0.3472,2.6348,2.8483,4.9401,1.2206,4.3969,4.3709,0.9064,4.8769,1.4091,7.474,0.8152,0.113,0.0144,7.5318,1.5288,2.5994,3.8893,4.2296,0.2583,3.8537,1.1354,2.39,3.3623,9.3845,4.8976,4.3538,2.2458,2.4099,4.295,4.6954,1.9574,7.5106,0.432,3.023,0.7914,1.4548,4.1193,0.6651,2.2773,7.5716,1.4034,0.951,6.598,2.4506,1.8271,6.5875,3.2427,0.611,1.7865,1.9369,4.4072,4.2688,1.8023,0.9027,0.0,1.3305,1.5174,2.5251,1.2545,1.4503,6.6471,0.9927,2.2593,5.3192,1.1168,2.4382,0.1526,1.549,0.9836,2.0501,4.8675,3.2406,3.2365,0.0092,0.0211,0.8773,5.0409,2.7497,2.4016,2.4942,5.5603,3.7687,1.377,8.1746,3.9918,3.3699,1.7179,4.0097,8.7194,0.7054,3.2645,1.7296,2.8224,5.6379,0.6382,2.0367,6.003,0.2981,1.9196,0.9693,0.2754,0.8787,10.5783,1.1648,6.2279,3.7955,2.3277,2.8512,3.7052,4.2194,5.639,3.6677,4.317,6.1849,0.6206,1.7599,6.6319,2.1534,5.1646,4.4916,2.3872,1.8511,1.911,4.5332,3.0633,0.2847,4.1373,1.364,3.8166,2.4511,3.4599,2.2279,5.5488,5.2079,5.2907,2.9798,0.0043,4.6714,2.8332,6.2745,0.6556,1.8943,4.6269,2.3374,3.2003,6.5931,1.6457,8.4687,0.5903,1.5097,5.7079,1.5529,1.7166,2.9515,5.6079,1.3651,3.5921,0.8705,3.7719,6.0134,2.3922,2.8545,5.4209,6.4617,0.0,1.1575,2.7674,0.1368,3.6344,0.1202,0.7263,3.0583,2.0838,2.5273,1.9806,4.5035,4.1012,2.3104,2.1648,9.2501,6.3937,8.7561,0.6242,6.032,0.0954,6.7264,7.8038,6.2071,0.6312,3.0189,12.2373,7.0518,7.9253,4.3908,2.6603,0.2385,1.1927,5.1582,0.7545,4.4357,0.3415,2.9967,7.6629,4.0643,5.0473,0.9818,2.9355,2.3283,3.8006,4.1337,6.199,1.0066,1.6764,6.586,5.677,0.7722,2.5855,5.076,5.5552,5.7184,2.0144,2.5743,0.4821,0.3747,4.2802,1.1498,6.1206,6.1703,1.8795,3.596,3.9852,6.2076,2.0711,10.4119,6.5275,0.3191,0.4531,6.7636,5.8167,4.1428,0.9491,3.7595,2.5911,1.4431,0.2416,4.1001,1.8591,2.897,3.8005,3.7857,2.8583,5.0327,0.915,0.0902,1.1947,0.8982,0.9207,1.1527,6.4686,1.9594,0.003,0.4227,4.0607,2.3326,2.0211,1.3336,6.2635,0.5797,7.6763,0.1032,0.8587,1.6557,1.8127,0.3303,0.3464,1.5303,0.9283,9.0916,1.3464,1.8623,2.9828,1.0585,4.6831,8.5218,2.0821,0.8127,2.7959,1.7467,1.8239,4.1713,2.4375,3.3039,3.5531,0.5024,3.8692,4.4158,2.9608,5.9511,2.8559,2.675,0.7438,0.1133,5.4184,2.8339,2.6819,4.709,3.5825,4.6797,5.0659,0.9698,0.2799,4.9082,3.2619,3.5562,0.3512,0.0837,5.2732,6.9026,0.3142,6.6893,0.4086,5.7174,0.0116,4.2207,4.8602,5.4703,6.843,1.6808,0.014,0.3782,1.0878,0.7167,2.9403,0.0622,2.1439,1.681,2.1786,0.1102,0.4789,5.062,5.0557,7.3191,14.3794,8.0417,1.0247,0.6225,5.2427,4.1223,1.7875,1.1722,0.4941,5.5791,1.9864,1.9511,1.3387,5.6181,0.3234,1.1833,0.3282,0.0084,5.8832,0.0237,5.6903,3.3441,1.3134,2.6361,0.3527,5.7285,4.6566,0.6858,0.2226,5.0986,4.6661,0.6138,1.0752,2.4395,4.9219,5.7413,6.9555,2.3951,1.9374,1.1163,0.0532,0.001,5.0126,2.4116,3.8899,5.8677,0.1002,0.3175,1.0321,4.4218,0.3074,6.644,3.2503,0.3203,3.1622,1.0286,1.2752,0.2144,3.2153,4.1444,0.5136,3.5579,1.6476,0.5407,1.8105,1.4985,0.2617,1.873,1.1482,0.2041,0.1447,8.9224,6.4495,5.8027,3.6687,6.1319,0.1306,1.2536,5.2475,1.1495,0.1094,4.5685,6.2747,1.095,1.0668,0.401,5.2715,0.8489,2.2921,5.3601,2.496,5.5641,4.7916,1.0936,3.1073,4.2122,3.2314,2.1305,0.5379,2.008,4.884,4.3831,2.4175,3.0801,1.7299,3.3971,6.3573,5.1092,2.2759,0.7491,2.6368,3.2254,1.0637,6.1565,3.9713,6.4934,2.0404,2.3778,5.7342,5.9289,1.9698,3.288,0.3292,1.8105,4.5185,1.4605,1.498,8.409,0.1383,0.8381,5.6562,5.4233,3.4773,4.1037,1.374,4.0979,5.2196,3.8162,1.2742,2.7731,1.1476,4.0835,2.4875,0.863,5.3521,3.8593,1.4029,5.1227,6.3719,3.3986,4.1165,2.5893,2.6522,3.7476,3.244,0.1773,3.1865,0.1737,1.3542,6.4434,2.3293,0.757,3.2255,5.5598,3.148,6.089,2.9846,0.9894,6.0155,2.5261,7.0577,2.5806,1.543,2.9521,3.0243,4.4601,1.5041,0.6196,0.583,3.6424,4.8536,2.8258,5.3199,6.047,2.0042,1.8235,0.6653,4.8502,9.1891,0.7833,4.1401,0.8813,1.2071,1.3728,3.1829,2.8163,3.4072,1.4925]}

The first step is to understand how to act on other people.\nAnd this is the biggest mistake that people make. So how to know when someone is flirting with you or not? What will be the answer to this question?\nToday you will learn about the most important signs of attention that a man will give to a woman and how to recognize them.\nIt is true that sometimes it is a little difficult to understand what a relationship is between two people.\nWhen we make love to each other, we get the most sensual feelings, but sometimes the situation can be very complicated.\nIt is important to understand if a man likes you or not, because, in most cases, people make a mistake when they want to make love only to fulfill their sexual needs without any connection.\nSo, if you want to know if the man you love likes you. The signs below will help you to draw the most important conclusions.\nIf you want to find out if he loves you, you must be careful when you talk to him. If he often ignores you, that is a negative sign that tells you that he does not like the fact that he has to say something when he comes to your mind.\nIt happens that men are more reserved than women, but if he avoids you, that means that he does not like the intimacy that you want.\nOf course, there are cases where a man is afraid of commitment. If he often ignores you and tries to avoid you for some reason, you must be very cautious.\nWhen men do not talk to you, it is normal for them to avoid you. Because when they are in love with you, they do not have any other feeling or wish.\nIf you want to know if the man you love likes you very much, then pay attention to how he talks to you. We all know that men are more expressive with women than with men.\nWhen he asks you for your opinion, if in his eyes you are more important, that means that he likes you very much. Try to find out what are the signs that he is talking to you often, he is thinking about you, and you are in his heart.","token_len":573,"entropy":[10.1157,8.0643,3.5903,5.982,4.8377,3.2112,7.9301,4.9975,4.3699,4.4472,2.9085,4.2829,6.8667,3.4037,4.6384,5.8961,5.4896,2.3187,1.406,14.4044,6.701,5.3733,3.1707,3.8735,8.498,4.5687,4.1635,2.31,6.9877,5.1211,1.4614,2.3061,0.9109,1.5853,4.0655,0.0781,5.318,1.5921,6.1426,2.566,2.1072,8.2599,7.4922,1.5374,3.0393,2.3066,7.2908,2.6463,4.9664,5.6205,2.9276,8.1646,0.3284,3.6309,1.6206,2.9123,7.9785,0.5273,5.6461,1.7717,6.8704,2.1037,3.9593,2.5092,0.7141,7.8564,0.8658,1.2942,1.2077,6.9027,2.1121,6.4348,1.7933,2.6532,5.1706,1.2754,6.3326,0.6572,5.8612,1.2056,1.8594,4.3638,4.3054,3.8282,3.8832,0.9696,0.0304,0.4131,2.7206,3.963,1.043,1.5807,0.0384,4.5749,1.2376,8.1804,0.3416,2.5161,0.673,1.9481,4.431,3.2197,6.3535,2.2787,4.6336,3.6065,3.093,0.3179,0.6026,2.3391,2.2355,0.0863,0.5752,1.0774,2.4167,5.2335,2.1488,0.1663,4.1654,1.5245,1.0628,2.6794,0.2851,0.7926,4.1388,2.6299,2.7563,2.0518,1.706,4.3917,2.594,0.2512,0.2145,0.5581,3.6778,2.4042,1.5416,4.5928,1.8217,7.976,0.1372,3.5552,1.025,4.232,3.0468,0.6091,2.0799,4.3369,2.7956,1.6151,3.0564,0.2066,1.2169,5.8835,3.9627,2.5922,5.2548,1.7286,2.567,0.5708,4.1844,0.0054,0.8092,0.0843,2.622,3.78,0.5319,4.8288,3.8787,2.9958,0.7051,5.2136,1.2798,1.1321,0.5234,0.2892,0.4165,6.3476,3.7638,0.9753,1.3658,2.7768,1.6954,3.082,1.4747,5.9275,1.2497,8.0597,2.47,2.8255,3.9572,1.9785,2.2501,1.4987,1.6882,0.2069,3.3569,1.4464,0.2891,4.3865,1.9467,0.6945,0.3148,4.0677,1.0431,5.0851,0.123,5.8031,2.6502,0.4896,3.2173,2.9882,1.9982,0.2022,3.4416,2.1516,1.5909,5.1198,1.2269,5.9962,0.5434,0.3709,0.8261,1.8075,4.3733,2.7836,5.1256,3.6433,2.3715,1.4071,0.0176,0.9289,0.6242,4.0667,2.946,3.6893,9.9476,0.3084,3.4801,2.2974,1.9684,2.8634,2.9264,6.5258,2.2848,1.2963,2.4051,3.3862,0.4527,0.6221,3.1578,0.5977,1.8273,0.3133,1.4269,4.7308,1.691,0.9633,4.4008,0.9716,1.3453,0.3688,1.7424,2.4193,5.2052,2.7117,2.9374,0.6232,0.0726,5.3202,5.6191,2.3153,1.7888,2.0051,0.3714,3.4779,0.2981,2.9416,1.1108,6.3647,0.6189,7.1749,0.6951,3.1058,1.7357,4.6083,3.3514,6.3985,1.1423,0.1893,2.658,1.5659,2.5475,0.5455,1.9357,0.2036,2.7378,1.6973,3.8049,1.3863,2.0534,1.5016,3.7681,0.0532,5.4969,4.5831,7.1857,4.9672,1.4707,0.7626,0.0571,1.2804,6.4691,1.5648,2.3294,2.9386,2.5351,1.5719,0.1989,3.2173,0.5235,1.8672,0.1789,3.3249,0.4281,1.2246,2.8517,2.9036,0.0276,0.7904,1.5911,2.9725,3.121,3.4345,3.5694,1.1392,3.2591,0.8799,0.4058,0.6395,2.5152,0.8104,7.9567,5.3645,0.1737,0.7715,4.2776,0.992,1.6066,7.3968,0.5152,2.1781,6.4214,0.4244,0.8109,0.6577,1.8489,0.0154,1.5577,5.8211,4.048,0.3702,2.6279,2.5519,2.6692,4.9735,2.5715,4.8583,1.0842,5.3525,0.8399,3.3749,6.3598,0.1789,0.2752,3.5595,6.6652,2.0731,3.2784,2.1748,2.2253,6.5665,2.5069,0.0721,1.5727,2.3305,2.8639,2.7919,6.8268,1.6638,0.719,1.0192,2.7962,0.4951,0.5459,1.4453,0.0167,0.8413,2.0705,6.4865,1.9279,0.3104,3.9822,0.8229,0.5537,6.0142,0.0397,0.3659,3.1117,0.3892,5.9855,0.903,1.9511,0.3099,2.5668,5.7315,1.0298,8.7198,1.772,2.1839,0.7171,6.7408,2.5666,0.1803,2.3578,3.2953,0.0308,4.1415,0.4984,5.0973,2.6899,0.1299,0.1408,3.3011,3.2593,1.3486,2.1128,3.0453,1.0411,0.5328,3.4493,4.4251,2.6077,0.3958,5.113,0.419,0.5915,0.6022,2.0702,0.8884,5.111,1.1019,0.6562,0.0416,3.9553,0.1789,1.057,5.3353,3.4043,0.9879,2.669,3.365,2.1425,1.0742,0.2182,0.2103,0.5398,2.5125,0.0355,3.0749,2.5399,3.6942,6.4737,3.283,6.9447,2.7485,0.6549,1.8931,1.06,1.886,0.1621,0.845,0.3855,2.0725,0.178,0.6768,0.2055,2.3048,0.0157,5.7902,0.0683,0.2623,2.351,9.1664,0.5012,0.2137,2.7705,0.8158,3.2025,0.317,0.0815,0.3587,5.9188,2.1571,0.8933,0.4488,2.4695,1.6632,2.1548,5.2444,3.9947,2.6157,1.0174,0.8722,0.209,0.4053,0.7084,2.4632,2.3563,5.3308,0.5229,2.0634,2.1131,1.948,0.8406,3.7554,6.8721,3.9986,2.5583,0.5616,0.901,4.4602,4.2406,1.6919,3.6358,1.2698,0.3082,0.4295,3.5984,0.2513,2.4565,0.0296,0.3398,8.1352,0.3999,3.1901,0.7672,2.0058,5.8637,0.7021,2.1587,0.6333,1.3526,1.4784,4.4592,0.2968,0.0439,8.9321,2.0601,6.1439,2.4644,5.1223,0.867,1.1461,2.4791,1.4659,2.0342,1.8144,3.9794,2.7067,2.5262,0.4048]}
{"prompt":"Write a Letter to your future self ( minimum 10 years from now ) about lessons learned in 2015 .","text":"Write a Letter to your future self ( minimum 10 years from now ) about lessons learned in 2015. Use a journal, or journal app as you can, but be sure to write an actual letter. Be as specific as you can about what you accomplished in your life in 2015, what your plans were during those plans, and what your goals and plans are for 2016. If you are writing a letter to an exact future self, then you might not mention certain facts, as you are not sure if those facts have changed since you\u2019re writing your letter. When you write this letter to your future self, use the words:\nDon\u2019t ask your family members to write a letter to you to tell you how they remember 2015 for you. If you have any family member(s), who have had a significant impact on your life throughout 2015, then ask them to write a letter to you about their experiences while supporting you on your own journey ( in college, as a professional, life changes, etc.) that you will be able to reference in your own personal letter to the future self.\nIn general, you should write a letter to a future self with a date. You can write a letter to the future self now, but once you write your letter, put a stamp on that date and then post it somewhere where you can see it often, like in your journal, at the top of your desk, etc. Your future self is going to want to know how the year went, and they will be looking for this letter to be delivered.\nI hope this makes sense.

{"prompt":"A wizard is walking down a busy street when it begins to rain .","text":"A wizard is walking down a busy street when it begins to rain. It stops to take off its jacket. It takes off its jacket, but leaves it in the front of the store. The man then takes off his coat and jacket.\n3. The wizard is walking down a busy street when it begins to rain (but it takes him to a store that sells only books) and he suddenly stops to take off his coat. The man then takes off his coat and jacket while the wizard is sitting in store watching him.\nI am not sure why the man is trying to take off his coat first, but then again, the coat must have caught in the store door because he didnt have to take it off. But I think the first phrase is the one that is important. Otherwise, its the same as a guy getting into a car with his hat on and the driver saying \"Let it go, let it go!\" (which I dont think it is.)\nThe man takes off his coat in front of the wizard. After that, the wizard is taken inside the store.\nIt seems like it's more important to think about the time line than that of the sentence structures; but I still found it interesting to think about.\nIf I were the man, I would expect to be walked inside the store, but I was not. I was probably walking with my coat and jacket off when he walked by and stopped to talk to me. But before he spoke to me, he took his jacket off and threw it in the front of the store. After he talked to me, I took off my coat and jacket.\nI wonder if he was trying to \"let it go\". \"Let it go\" would mean that he is putting the jacket and coat in the same place in which he left his hat, which doesn't seem to make sense from what you wrote. It makes sense that he has to take off his hat, because the hat is inside the vehicle; but to give his jacket and coat the same treatment, he has to take them off so that he can toss them away. He is not putting them in the same place as his hat (because he is not leaving his hat in his car), but he is putting the jacket and coat in the same place in which he left his hat.\nIt's probably the first one. Unless, he was only trying to get the coat off, then it's the second one. So you said something like if someone asks you \"Did you put the car in the garage?\" and you replied \"No. Did you?\n\"Let me put that in the garage\", and then she goes with \" Let me put something in the garage,\" that's going to make that person think that you are trying to have them believe that you are trying to give them false information.","token_len":573,"entropy":[11.1728,3.2476,8.319,2.6441,1.2735,4.7986,0.2908,3.9258,4.0173,5.8426,0.1736,0.3885,0.6499,2.9085,5.4962,3.6622,3.5684,4.209,1.7065,3.5938,1.7293,2.0119,3.6264,0.5552,0.3747,2.608,2.321,2.888,6.0088,1.573,2.3412,0.9693,6.0533,1.8149,0.2427,4.2627,0.6555,1.99,3.3185,4.5411,3.3965,0.582,0.481,2.2655,0.9046,6.3622,1.5403,1.9139,11.6802,0.8273,1.9583,3.2829,2.2303,1.1084,0.2672,0.1213,0.114,0.004,0.1098,0.0997,0.1679,0.0024,0.0113,6.8923,5.0951,3.1747,3.4542,9.4196,3.8425,2.1425,3.3599,3.8182,2.8877,5.4747,5.3712,1.5547,2.8273,3.0766,4.3831,1.6573,1.7091,1.8257,0.2027,0.2073,1.2661,0.6499,1.4361,0.5426,0.4117,0.3487,0.036,0.0365,0.548,0.7125,0.2868,6.3574,2.3856,1.3483,1.8275,3.5592,1.3037,8.5903,6.9832,3.8856,0.7048,1.0973,6.812,3.267,2.0311,1.0985,2.5992,1.7012,1.5887,1.8317,5.5768,0.0482,2.0143,0.4761,0.0886,0.3995,7.2017,0.9768,0.639,3.5037,3.7954,0.5439,3.0337,7.8742,4.81,0.8346,4.998,5.4889,0.6263,6.5839,5.9919,4.2523,2.1092,9.0976,2.367,2.3021,2.6171,1.8709,0.0915,0.9234,4.5862,2.6223,2.3145,1.7722,5.841,8.5049,1.3052,2.7358,2.7235,1.0032,2.5328,4.8546,0.9612,6.8058,0.6005,6.7628,3.4823,1.6436,1.6928,3.9364,5.4709,4.0607,3.3846,0.4751,1.5998,2.0005,1.8317,5.4226,0.6615,1.1417,3.5877,2.8072,4.3905,0.8687,5.639,3.5576,0.978,1.8363,2.2155,0.2685,0.1442,2.4823,3.818,3.2221,2.9475,3.4869,1.0239,3.9046,1.4314,3.4558,0.8554,2.4899,2.2069,4.761,0.1865,0.0521,0.4534,4.2084,1.8226,0.0184,0.4787,6.7821,1.2807,4.8073,1.859,0.5557,0.8019,1.0661,2.4384,5.153,6.0301,1.0908,0.2772,1.1695,1.8553,3.6465,2.6179,1.418,2.8594,3.1081,4.922,2.7035,0.7908,5.9131,0.7169,1.2884,5.478,6.1421,2.3754,5.1469,1.7314,0.4788,6.9915,12.2434,6.253,4.0376,1.8563,4.3667,5.051,0.8746,1.2215,1.974,2.2612,0.4367,2.0645,1.2179,3.996,2.5232,2.1987,3.4005,2.5465,0.9523,0.4463,0.4226,5.7269,1.6341,2.0658,6.7874,6.9682,1.0988,0.1833,2.3994,1.7122,1.2467,3.0695,1.3606,0.6502,1.5869,2.087,5.1903,1.3378,3.7161,0.9047,3.6786,3.3814,2.5238,3.4276,3.2002,4.3559,2.4565,3.9787,2.1132,4.1986,0.7404,6.468,0.5635,0.4139,0.269,3.2595,6.2059,1.5205,5.6018,0.6868,0.0462,0.232,0.9772,2.6679,3.1969,2.4271,0.2583,0.7974,4.4143,0.061,2.0512,0.3272,2.9867,0.3582,0.1129,0.1973,0.3822,4.4556,2.2263,6.5777,0.1295,0.0655,0.2751,2.5397,3.6064,0.8944,0.0545,0.3586,0.3246,0.4685,1.188,0.7499,2.0567,3.5157,0.6661,1.9205,1.634,2.1861,0.0185,5.4101,4.0,0.237,0.0112,3.6333,6.1584,0.4201,0.0282,0.0034,1.2699,2.9991,2.2479,1.3132,0.7733,2.3654,5.4294,2.0659,1.6411,3.345,1.8077,1.8605,1.0653,2.0005,0.7121,3.6844,3.3726,0.9849,3.385,2.38,0.9564,3.153,2.7008,5.6499,0.0022,2.1,0.747,3.0809,1.1175,5.705,3.5098,4.3388,5.3062,0.8206,3.1982,4.1501,0.4842,1.1158,0.5111,4.2131,2.7753,2.2844,0.7256,0.2632,2.3029,2.1088,2.1245,2.0955,2.033,1.3733,4.8937,0.5084,9.166,6.2207,1.0084,4.8557,4.6142,3.8367,2.3284,0.8053,1.1563,2.5031,0.1664,4.6942,1.4575,1.9163,2.3259,0.0651,1.356,2.8283,1.4497,5.3017,0.8389,1.1147,0.5439,6.5236,0.2954,3.1076,0.6517,3.8368,2.0051,2.285,4.0906,1.5354,0.4292,0.5232,0.3956,0.2479,1.4752,1.3943,0.3588,3.6409,3.1698,1.4151,1.5414,1.8998,5.112,1.9848,0.0932,1.3662,3.5934,0.9992,1.9732,0.8785,1.2677,0.5488,2.2914,2.446,0.9078,0.6435,0.4298,0.319,0.3931,0.0982,0.179,1.8124,0.1381,0.1775,0.3658,0.1149,0.0529,0.3823,1.006,3.193,2.6489,4.1769,3.0472,3.7476,4.9133,2.3675,7.2314,3.7961,4.8586,1.8978,5.5639,1.8683,0.0109,1.8449,2.3957,3.0784,1.2394,1.8234,2.1445,1.8434,1.8133,2.4842,1.1467,0.4922,0.2788,4.2985,4.554,6.4683,3.5023,1.4073,6.7768,3.7238,5.456,0.6786,2.6681,3.7583,0.1646,3.5254,1.4672,6.7568,0.5217,0.452,5.1043,1.1295,1.8209,0.3471,4.8449,0.3327,1.3651,4.3287,3.5801,0.2189,5.5977,3.9306,3.2432,6.5756,3.3781,2.3733,3.4522,1.4513,0.9664,2.1978,2.7993,1.603,2.2687,5.8659,3.9533,5.3893,1.32,8.4786,0.3819,0.2181,6.8806,0.4155,0.1333,0.2351,5.7667,5.5418,1.4686,5.4464,0.068,1.967,5.3643,3.4874,1.6166,1.3962,1.7312,1.3545,1.9924,0.0187,4.9545,3.1294,6.6914,0.4484,0.523,0.8344,1.0453,0.019,3.7275,0.2586,5.5486,0.3385,0.6149]}
{"prompt":"`` But why shoot the janitor ? ''","text":"`` But why shoot the janitor? ''\nNow the question is how can i get the input from user, to choose the option, then how can i tell to use that option in the switch?\nIf someone can answer that kind of question that will help me lot of in understanding the java switches and how they are used.\nThank You\n\nA:\n\nWell you're thinking about using the switch construct wrong. If you were making it as a command line application, then you'd put the main() method inside the switch block to define the code to be run when the user types the command. However, because you're going to be interacting with the user and using menus, you need to put the code for the menu inside the main() method. Here is an example of what I mean with adding the menu to main(). If you have an instance of your class called Janitor, then: \nJanitor j = new Janitor();\nwhile(true)\n{\n    System.out.println(\"Choosed action?\");\n    String[] stringArray = {\"Exit\", \"Spray cleaner\", \"Dust\"};\n    System.out.println(\"Please Choose an action: \");\n    String choice = System.console().readLine(); \/\/reads standard input\n    System.out.println(\"Please go to another choice by typing'Exit' \");\n    System.out.println(\"Please go back to the original choice by typing 'Exit  \");\n\n    char[] charArray = choice.toCharArray();   \n    switch(charArray[0])\n    {\n        case's':\n            System.out.println(\"Spray cleaner...\");\n            j.sprayCleaner();\n            break;\n        case 'd':\n            System.out.println(\"Dust...\");\n            break;\n        default:           \n            System.out.println(\"Please go back to the original choice by typing 'Exit \");\n    }   \n}\n\nIf the user then goes to the first choice ('Exit'), then the switch block will end. If the user goes back to the 'Enter' choice, the next switch block will start and the code will be run.","token_len":574,"entropy":[7.7266,5.0936,10.0234,2.9273,9.8154,0.1466,1.3012,7.5306,2.2522,9.825,3.0806,4.2141,0.8895,2.9612,3.5865,7.007,2.6489,2.1771,9.9586,1.8142,6.9758,3.7769,3.8618,6.9211,1.6327,5.3822,3.1254,4.5311,4.8543,0.6307,0.5697,4.5917,3.6798,3.1154,3.2897,0.9045,3.0308,1.7471,7.5859,1.5108,1.1797,4.1446,5.2341,2.9702,4.0823,1.1688,6.4599,0.0209,0.2757,4.9113,3.7943,2.1716,0.779,8.5081,3.3881,4.9256,5.2764,1.5637,8.7592,8.143,2.3381,1.8069,1.615,2.1447,1.394,1.027,0.8963,5.9579,3.2547,1.7835,7.4391,4.8502,4.2724,2.5188,0.3831,4.9923,3.5576,3.7706,6.871,1.464,3.971,1.9066,2.1256,9.0705,8.0417,1.4478,3.3671,0.8494,3.9369,5.3001,3.401,4.331,1.35,4.276,0.7485,5.5247,1.16,2.5707,1.0932,2.0158,5.1098,1.2717,6.3294,3.4393,1.1777,3.8457,0.9483,1.2652,5.0587,4.37,4.9438,0.9553,5.6226,2.4054,2.5362,1.7259,2.3708,0.9698,2.0607,5.4106,1.5638,2.3682,1.2577,3.8444,0.636,4.2928,2.3628,1.7553,3.7706,0.1465,2.0626,5.977,0.0691,0.7937,2.7334,3.0279,3.45,9.2557,1.0033,1.2803,2.738,0.2549,3.5973,0.6915,3.5013,4.0946,0.845,2.072,2.9913,0.2524,3.2344,0.0828,0.3268,0.7728,5.0807,1.0942,1.7642,0.1213,1.2693,2.2855,2.7251,2.2991,3.4425,8.4236,1.4318,1.3662,2.1032,4.9206,2.7318,4.3933,0.6967,3.1678,2.7604,5.6743,0.1803,5.3718,2.6619,2.8315,8.8214,0.0228,1.2984,1.8819,7.7491,7.9102,4.4218,7.1086,0.0047,5.8076,1.7964,0.8719,0.075,0.0002,0.7093,0.9159,7.5734,1.6247,3.4953,0.2085,2.1741,2.3677,0.2773,10.3414,4.6451,3.0568,7.764,0.046,0.1412,0.0103,0.023,0.4832,7.7772,7.594,5.7438,7.3011,0.0196,0.2416,6.3901,0.402,1.0996,6.7637,3.9724,6.4687,5.0784,0.0528,5.449,9.7684,0.7825,0.2451,10.1117,1.2633,10.7746,0.2832,0.1186,6.0087,4.5849,0.3199,0.1484,6.6827,0.081,0.2656,1.4088,0.0012,0.0262,0.0009,0.0376,0.1404,5.2336,8.9471,3.1935,1.9294,3.0014,1.039,0.6579,0.0844,4.0536,0.0199,0.0423,3.1618,7.8831,0.3427,5.3538,0.0011,10.1526,5.2775,4.5853,1.1749,0.2101,4.4225,11.2543,8.9096,1.0962,1.7472,5.6135,0.0548,0.2142,1.9143,0.0009,0.0211,0.001,0.0498,0.2128,3.1673,6.9731,0.7457,5.0623,6.671,6.7614,3.2598,11.0694,11.801,3.4511,3.4517,0.072,0.1935,1.9888,0.0236,0.0146,0.7651,0.0008,0.0209,0.0009,0.029,0.0741,1.1717,1.6985,2.0845,0.1478,1.6805,3.2437,0.8135,0.9038,0.1029,1.8674,6.1885,12.2737,5.9092,0.075,5.5585,10.3822,0.0353,2.9696,8.6584,1.9538,6.0911,0.9372,0.2136,4.581,0.3161,3.0904,0.9227,0.4856,0.0414,3.995,0.0666,0.0118,2.5593,7.0761,2.0419,4.0636,4.8863,0.4983,2.5175,0.0289,3.3917,0.7948,1.1789,1.011,8.3893,0.0308,0.0178,1.1236,0.6284,0.6283,0.0562,0.3182,3.594,4.5224,3.8261,2.8059,5.8128,10.7377,9.6404,0.5985,2.8608,0.0665,0.0116,0.0208,0.2721,0.5337,0.6251,0.7545,0.9007,0.8832,0.7379,9.8703,0.0032,0.0559,0.0021,0.1106,0.1886,10.3242,0.0902,0.5945,5.1756,0.0345,0.3913,0.1002,0.0044,0.0039,0.0132,0.4071,1.0115,0.7972,0.3836,0.298,0.423,0.6764,5.8415,0.1982,1.7961,0.037,1.9445,0.0354,1.6768,0.284,0.5514,0.0053,0.0042,0.004,0.0087,0.0989,0.1455,0.0869,0.0973,0.2284,0.7466,6.078,0.1831,0.0992,0.8631,0.0133,0.0068,0.0051,0.0066,0.0597,0.2868,5.1578,4.4113,7.3569,1.8317,0.2792,0.1556,0.0106,0.0055,0.005,0.005,0.0065,0.0087,0.0094,0.0443,0.1467,0.5134,2.0494,0.0008,0.0273,0.0009,0.0541,0.039,0.391,3.9222,0.0023,0.0683,0.0125,0.0062,0.0057,0.0047,0.0038,0.0038,0.0041,0.0046,0.0093,0.1062,0.545,2.3214,0.0159,0.0294,0.1413,0.0087,0.0051,0.0039,0.0031,0.0067,0.0387,4.4068,0.1544,3.1056,0.0462,0.0177,0.0069,0.0102,0.0243,0.0798,0.1072,0.2091,0.5094,1.1525,2.3286,2.2137,0.0066,0.0056,0.137,0.4362,0.5069,0.5324,0.7048,1.0572,1.4616,1.7052,4.3577,0.0014,0.0378,0.0013,0.0855,0.0386,2.1622,2.3189,1.0216,0.0682,0.3172,0.1269,0.2323,0.177,0.0109,0.7709,5.3013,4.7347,0.0628,0.0905,0.2452,0.0131,0.0074,8.8664,2.6118,0.0795,0.255,1.2911,5.3007,0.575,5.0687,3.3283,2.9361,1.7847,5.1001,4.3035,0.3018,0.8085,4.6075,1.4596,9.7618,3.95,2.7374,1.0168,1.0252,2.1839,3.2435,1.188,6.086,1.4238,2.11,0.4196,0.1318,2.1908,2.7364,0.1388,0.1295,5.4071,4.7765,0.2593,2.6441,1.274,1.7368,4.6763,1.5614,0.3097,0.1976,2.0477,2.9685,1.0241,3.8527,0.747,1.0414,1.1826,0.8304]}
{"prompt":"You , as the Supreme Commander of an allied alien force , are discussing with your generals the strategy to adopt for attacking and invading Earth . However , your knowledge of humans and of their capabilities is based on Hollywood movies .","text":"You, as the Supreme Commander of an allied alien force, are discussing with your generals the strategy to adopt for attacking and invading Earth. However, your knowledge of humans and of their capabilities is based on Hollywood movies. Some aliens also believe that these movies are just part of man's mental and emotional development. This movie is part of a continuing series : it features men who take charge, decide something, and are prepared to deal with all comers. You are not expecting the aliens to attack your fleet, but they are determined to find out if you have some big balls you have hid. It is up to you to decide which aliens to target and to which they will have to fire the last missile. The aliens will also try to trick you by asking you a series of questions... Are you ready to be taken at your word and come across?\nYou only have one shot. The aliens you select to target will use some of the following strategies.\n\u2022 They will show you which targets they want to destroy and make you choose from a pool of targets that includes their targets. You can choose one, but you will have to decide whether or not to strike at those targets before launching your missiles. \u2022 They may also show you a target that does not belong to anyone, but that the aliens want to destroy anyway. \u2022 They may try to trick you by asking you a series of questions to see how far you are from surrendering. If you can survive them, you will be rewarded with a bonus.\n\u2022 If you survive all of these games, this is the end of the game and you will get a large bonus.\nThis is an educational computer software product that includes educational material and exercises designed to help a participant learn about a particular type of human behavior. The participant learns to interpret body language and facial expressions of different people. It is designed to help an individual determine how much information an individual conveys through his or her facial expressions, body language, tone, and word usage. The computer software teaches a person what to look for and what to ignore. It comes with four levels : beginner, advanced beginner, intermediate, and advanced.\nThe computer programs in each level are divided into two sections. The first section shows the individual various ways the person's body may express emotion through body language. For example, in level 3, the computer begins by showing the user what to look for and what to ignore when an individual shows a calm or neutral face.

{"prompt":"An troll challenges someone over the internet to `` fight him IRL '' . That someone turns out to be Superman , who is bored of fighting evil , and now spends his time beating up internet trolls .","text":"An troll challenges someone over the internet to `` fight him IRL ''. That someone turns out to be Superman, who is bored of fighting evil, and now spends his time beating up internet trolls. At one point, a guy who doesn't believe in Superman turns up who also doesn't believe in Superman, and Superman takes him on without thinking twice.\nBut that one story doesn't make all the other stories look like bad comics, despite not being told well.\nI mean, the story is bad at many points, but the execution wasn't bad. Sure the artwork wasn't amazing, but the artwork was mostly good. The writing wasn't terrible, but the writing was mostly good. There were really few things that made me question the story - it all worked for me.\nThe story wasn't bad. But, it was written poorly. So, your whole experience with it was negative regardless.\nIf a comic is crap, it shouldn't matter what's wrapped around it, which is why I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews this received.\nIt was a very entertaining issue of Superman, one that actually has more potential than the first few issues.\nI think this was a horrible, unnecessary issue that is an embarrassment to both DC and the creator of this particular story. It's one of those books that can get a bit repetitive, but in a good way. It still has one of the better Superman characters I've seen and his return was both satisfying and interesting.\nA story about a small time superhero who is basically Superman without all the super powers and with a lot less intelligence. The first comic is okay, but the story just gets bad and it's hard not to see the writer as trying to justify their choices. The rest of the issue is better, but it's too late to salvage a decent issue.\nThis is a Superman comic, written by Tom Taylor and drawn by Ivan Reis. Taylor is a much better writer than Reis, but he is one of the worst storytellers I have ever seen.\nThis may not have done too well due to the fact that it was published after Superman died, it was a shame that the story ended thus, but I am happy to have read it.\nSadly, this issue was a direct sequel to Man of Steel, which was such a terrible issue. This was a very entertaining story, though.\nUnfortunately, the art and story aren't all that great. It doesn't work well as one story - like most Superman stories - it all feels crammed in a small period of time.\nI loved the way this story played off the tone of the series and the tone of the story of Superman in general. It had the perfect mixture of fun, action, super-powered action, and the characters I hoped to see were actually there.","token_len":574,"entropy":[11.4901,11.2176,6.5557,5.9535,1.4615,2.7395,1.4255,12.9612,11.9275,3.7384,7.778,4.4727,6.7538,5.3995,4.2979,7.5471,8.1124,0.8295,0.0745,0.0528,9.1935,2.0258,2.7451,1.7639,9.3662,1.9794,2.3563,6.5205,2.166,0.7967,5.7942,5.6225,0.9597,1.5072,5.3297,0.5784,7.5902,0.5365,0.8963,6.0022,2.7862,0.0316,0.8838,2.7171,3.6257,3.0492,3.8851,0.002,3.8517,0.2331,3.2621,4.1922,2.4435,7.0097,5.3344,1.6349,0.0013,0.1605,0.0506,1.1955,1.7149,0.8738,5.7569,4.2799,2.0946,3.6462,6.9035,5.0299,2.7751,0.9309,3.1021,8.8614,3.1173,5.6815,6.1783,2.9308,0.0041,2.8075,5.647,0.6687,5.3948,1.5335,5.9295,1.5382,4.8122,4.7823,2.0363,6.5492,5.8677,1.1509,6.3558,4.6983,0.9787,2.0187,2.8358,3.1313,0.3052,2.9472,3.5825,1.6789,4.2687,4.655,5.1726,1.4399,0.5576,0.5778,2.0983,6.047,6.2784,0.0007,2.0067,1.3361,5.2185,3.6833,6.2748,3.6171,0.0025,5.1249,0.3137,0.1687,1.4753,4.5133,1.0965,6.0734,1.6059,0.8778,1.6215,3.7974,2.6829,0.0044,2.2839,0.79,0.3546,1.109,1.6235,0.7778,3.5875,1.8508,0.3894,3.14,1.1935,5.0347,2.7649,3.4219,0.7795,2.2952,1.5541,4.7875,0.9733,3.0434,5.3446,2.3791,5.1604,4.2283,2.7784,0.8005,0.9102,1.3156,2.3244,2.837,4.1567,0.0016,1.9477,2.2922,3.869,3.9816,1.7634,1.0878,5.5477,1.6645,0.4872,4.3344,0.8641,7.4283,6.3691,4.9501,1.5907,3.4745,2.0502,5.9165,8.1167,1.3933,1.1121,3.9723,4.768,2.4401,1.6785,6.901,0.5333,1.7494,3.8385,0.0002,3.894,1.7725,3.7193,10.7983,1.2809,0.2742,2.2534,4.5698,0.3583,1.2924,1.4782,2.3509,5.4707,3.5357,1.6185,3.3006,0.0085,3.3719,0.4922,4.8422,9.6026,0.4669,1.3481,3.5628,2.1018,2.1986,3.427,5.036,5.7927,3.9166,3.5794,2.2339,4.8251,0.6158,4.6163,4.1512,3.5167,2.5105,0.6554,1.8936,3.5706,4.6296,0.3556,0.6605,1.2031,2.062,2.8224,2.4613,2.1833,1.4808,6.5889,3.7728,6.1296,2.2953,1.8418,4.3121,5.029,2.4878,0.3561,4.3432,2.3662,0.2376,2.2482,3.7127,1.5082,1.8798,5.0296,3.2265,0.2108,2.799,1.4879,3.965,1.0347,0.9525,4.905,0.3218,3.7781,3.2899,2.4767,2.9813,2.8989,1.1058,0.8188,4.3082,1.7022,1.6351,0.0689,0.4077,2.001,5.8942,1.6835,5.2248,1.0511,0.2319,3.3043,3.1355,5.1751,1.6258,0.1082,1.3517,3.5544,6.7867,6.7621,3.4639,6.2325,4.4103,0.0939,3.1388,0.3066,0.9227,4.5602,4.5315,1.9695,1.4685,5.4948,6.1492,4.0635,1.7177,2.4677,5.7163,3.5464,5.4404,3.9179,0.5571,4.3972,1.893,2.2457,5.3688,1.7597,2.5188,2.9911,5.2485,0.917,3.3958,3.796,5.4264,2.7152,5.5898,0.52,0.2516,1.3015,4.5708,4.304,3.2599,5.0894,2.1876,2.9947,1.1377,3.4399,3.2519,0.0108,4.3855,1.8102,3.8898,2.9255,2.8329,0.0667,4.9729,4.0459,4.3652,1.05,2.8535,4.4416,0.1565,0.2361,2.0278,0.7343,4.4625,1.0017,0.3993,1.5485,0.6191,4.699,4.148,1.0917,6.7854,3.6094,3.5773,3.1812,0.8235,0.6281,2.8684,1.4737,1.3513,5.3849,2.5109,1.5655,5.7372,0.7864,5.2202,5.0093,1.7118,1.5318,0.0257,7.3726,1.1836,0.5378,0.5844,6.3328,1.5327,1.2814,6.42,0.594,1.447,0.2885,0.6231,0.0003,0.4711,1.0185,1.5258,2.9598,4.606,0.138,0.2571,2.9292,6.2021,0.5696,0.0332,0.6685,2.3593,0.5376,0.6777,0.5093,1.8669,2.4868,5.7575,1.9544,2.1087,5.5391,4.2089,1.5405,6.3252,0.0142,0.7416,1.9705,0.0911,1.7517,1.2634,4.7243,3.8868,2.2458,4.4227,0.9802,5.8548,1.2292,2.4627,5.3068,1.7366,1.9827,1.8583,2.8446,9.1054,3.5838,0.6685,1.861,3.8957,3.1133,1.6964,2.7433,3.5645,1.0073,1.0631,0.9169,7.9428,0.1656,1.7234,1.6737,1.8133,2.4999,6.4908,1.5226,0.1855,5.5329,0.2033,0.0031,1.0466,1.4426,1.4136,7.0085,0.1684,3.6422,3.2706,1.794,3.1367,1.5601,1.3166,3.4031,5.0287,2.0355,1.0578,5.368,2.4436,1.0535,5.8309,0.0651,1.8723,4.2253,3.0735,2.1546,3.9943,0.0006,3.049,0.3387,0.972,0.563,2.5453,3.9937,0.0004,4.6533,1.4587,3.3929,5.306,5.3899,4.6432,4.7892,3.672,2.814,0.5361,0.9221,2.4427,5.2661,2.5434,8.9729,2.5562,2.6379,3.6324,7.7035,0.6534,0.0214,0.5973,1.3095,1.9259,5.2281,0.9294,2.9336,2.7813,1.7435,5.6269,4.2496,1.7257,4.8707,0.3005,0.5598,4.1923,2.2925,1.2713,3.4322,0.2317,0.4616,2.1217,4.9391,1.6859,4.0531,0.4316,0.3201,1.834,3.6055,2.7402,4.3659,5.5293,0.0164,4.3796,1.4247,2.3047,0.5027,7.5095,1.7904,2.4854,3.4081,0.5027,0.598,3.241,5.0249,4.5851,6.0319,1.7049,0.5819,7.4603,4.0817,3.3314,0.4645]}
{"prompt":"Make me feel depressed about growing up .","text":"Make me feel depressed about growing up.I feel like I always have to be the older than the younger one or the sister then the brother.\nWhen I am older my mom wants me to be a doctor. I am not really interested in it at all. I have to work in a office but it is always boring to me.\nI feel like my friend are more interested in football and playing computer games then playing with me and my sister.I feel like my sister is more serious than me. She is always reading her books, and then she spends her time by doing her homework and she never has fun with us.I am always playing basketball then playing with my sister and she is always playing computer game.She is also working hard, then she spends her time by doing her assignment,and her other job.My dad has just work two hours and my mom has just gone out for shopping her and my sister.I don't know what I would do if my friends are going to play with me and I have already done my work and I spend my time by doing homework and my work so I should be the older than them. I have to feel so sad and I don't know why I feel this way.\ni feel the same...we are more interested in our phones and electronics.. and we only wanna play with our friends when we are at school..\nI want a mom with enough time in her hands so that she will still enjoy herself, take walks or do things with her kids, if things get busy and my mom can make time for everything, than I will feel better and hopefully the other kids will feel the same.\nI don't need to be the older or older than others, I only need my own time to finish the things I want to do, like playing games or whatever else I want to do. People who ask me that, and think of only playing games, they think you are old enough to do this with others, but it's not like that and I wouldn't feel too good about it, I prefer to have my own space, or to be able to take my time, but not to play with others on my time. What can I tell them that they don't know about me? I don't always want to do everything with my own friends, I also want to play things with my friends, but it's different when we are at school, when we already know one another and when people are already adults to have fun, but we might be young to have fun, and I can't tell people that I don't like playing, I just prefer it alone, I just prefer to have my own time than to spend time with others.\nIt looks like we are growing up in a way we are not prepared for and I think we can only expect to grow up.","token_len":574,"entropy":[6.3085,2.7645,9.3323,3.6288,8.8048,0.1518,2.1742,6.9109,3.3255,0.847,1.0076,6.0051,2.1756,1.3377,1.9873,2.8566,7.5328,7.1369,1.22,1.3535,4.5736,4.7177,2.6161,7.1265,8.6242,3.036,3.9214,1.6824,3.4367,10.1354,0.572,4.2702,1.7681,4.0046,2.6922,5.4263,0.5931,0.0425,1.4216,2.1383,4.2144,1.279,1.6948,2.5504,2.0708,3.7434,3.3813,0.1818,2.3215,3.0216,0.1842,0.4437,1.0674,2.8913,1.9605,3.7062,3.6935,1.4002,6.133,4.5751,2.7834,1.2274,4.0159,5.4612,2.4811,2.2509,0.5652,1.5703,1.2873,3.0255,0.4843,2.4282,6.6403,7.7071,4.3051,2.6628,0.0533,7.7921,2.2306,4.5026,6.4821,0.133,3.9824,4.2038,3.6951,3.1755,3.2038,1.9923,2.4476,0.3233,3.6083,1.5996,0.2342,1.3435,2.5065,2.7027,0.7717,7.2446,2.2431,1.55,0.7706,3.5948,1.1577,3.3877,5.8234,3.8587,2.5811,3.2112,3.4475,4.9503,1.3204,6.0873,1.8897,0.9365,6.7625,6.7031,2.6821,0.9425,2.5328,3.9398,3.8841,3.3803,4.5361,1.5017,3.3165,0.3816,2.2792,2.5655,2.8397,5.1082,4.0446,6.1645,1.7133,2.3827,0.4778,0.5752,2.141,2.7334,1.2615,0.6218,2.0323,4.2116,5.1145,0.8319,3.6781,1.0299,3.8823,5.762,2.3045,2.733,5.6123,1.043,3.42,0.448,0.264,1.0309,1.2761,0.3625,10.0836,2.8634,7.2586,3.6598,5.5681,3.5308,1.049,3.8035,3.6383,3.0756,5.4484,10.4627,4.7223,1.8401,3.5247,4.0561,0.4976,2.2144,2.3245,4.0465,2.825,1.9586,5.074,8.2346,2.6852,1.1537,1.1075,1.256,1.9124,3.0707,0.0026,1.7344,1.5686,2.2104,2.0157,0.4191,1.0121,1.57,5.0437,3.7249,3.7186,0.1425,3.6283,2.1861,0.1769,1.5188,3.7496,2.8338,5.3221,2.7204,2.2156,3.4314,2.1207,1.3359,6.619,0.6531,0.4436,1.0446,0.912,2.7768,1.202,2.5395,3.7146,5.988,0.9058,5.2451,0.7947,3.98,2.4454,2.3452,3.0387,0.3747,2.7048,2.7678,1.3812,4.9463,5.4738,2.9781,2.0801,2.7403,2.3704,0.0021,1.3747,2.7972,1.5526,1.5684,2.2357,0.0256,0.3543,1.2839,7.1948,2.5661,5.2576,0.6015,8.5413,6.0355,1.3625,4.6739,2.9209,0.0366,3.9334,7.3198,1.588,6.3057,5.8435,4.6818,2.0905,5.1593,8.2442,1.1218,1.9123,1.555,0.762,4.1889,0.6288,0.8857,3.2442,1.5584,2.8976,2.1252,1.7412,4.0132,4.6568,4.9219,3.0155,6.5506,2.9548,4.4813,0.8223,4.1839,3.5873,1.4454,1.2054,2.9066,5.9873,4.1263,2.8786,3.0664,6.595,9.3329,4.7031,2.5112,2.7681,1.9413,0.6522,3.5054,2.3056,4.5873,6.1233,2.3276,3.9447,2.6515,4.4151,1.3462,3.2016,3.9894,3.7986,0.4263,5.0121,1.7372,6.7155,1.2321,2.6533,1.5167,4.1325,2.1056,6.2085,4.517,3.069,1.1906,0.3313,2.8646,1.0854,0.0017,0.7744,0.7886,1.3019,2.9526,0.0015,4.9779,0.8997,1.7297,2.4394,1.2093,3.4169,2.5279,2.048,5.8064,2.0227,1.1959,4.6435,0.227,3.6087,2.5992,1.8802,2.142,6.7448,2.8815,2.5407,0.5217,1.3731,0.3541,0.6666,1.9803,3.6868,4.0476,3.0079,1.3898,5.5211,3.0837,1.3429,0.8626,0.2909,0.1333,0.5687,7.0468,2.7303,4.9294,0.5427,3.1764,2.3401,3.6882,5.5906,4.5889,7.7835,2.9898,1.4467,1.3285,3.6977,2.9891,6.1333,0.6853,4.9002,2.1525,0.5785,2.453,3.7324,5.3061,3.4732,1.2584,1.7875,3.3122,1.9994,0.847,2.7144,0.843,4.1485,1.2392,5.2285,0.0009,3.2442,4.4574,2.2326,0.666,0.7142,2.7487,1.5744,6.8461,0.8251,3.44,1.749,0.3523,5.5779,2.24,4.5869,3.3268,1.8114,1.7227,0.0075,3.738,1.9054,1.3207,2.5466,2.6501,4.3182,1.7652,3.1452,1.7127,1.2121,5.5808,0.9462,4.4011,0.8431,6.748,4.6417,0.3561,4.3978,1.6149,2.6661,2.2278,1.8438,0.0004,1.8855,1.2763,1.5226,1.1781,1.9895,2.0317,0.0011,6.8866,2.1997,0.2929,3.4688,4.3322,3.4109,0.7031,2.4046,5.1517,0.6983,1.7168,4.2322,2.6023,0.3612,2.0033,4.521,0.5822,0.8647,1.1617,1.2246,1.1195,2.7729,1.0668,4.9976,2.7484,3.312,0.7813,2.4174,0.7937,1.5256,2.8665,0.7576,7.4177,2.2405,4.1214,0.1693,1.7354,1.6463,5.4187,1.1728,3.5572,8.1439,4.6782,4.1575,2.3429,1.9497,2.1106,2.1894,5.9141,2.1435,5.4509,3.0936,1.7855,1.0285,2.2458,1.7037,1.9311,3.3082,0.911,2.361,3.2804,1.2814,0.6825,2.0747,0.0003,1.5422,2.2366,4.4896,1.9538,2.1185,6.0624,3.3095,7.3922,1.5365,2.4997,2.5076,3.0206,1.2844,2.013,1.5168,0.2464,0.8213,7.171,1.4857,3.7257,1.4831,0.3828,1.4066,0.7115,0.7911,4.0678,6.1873,0.2972,3.2408,0.723,4.9217,0.9133,2.7215,0.5624,3.6386,3.5862,2.2915,0.4189,5.4102,0.8888,3.2941,1.5885,2.2847,1.6142,3.8695,4.1801,4.4681,1.6631,1.3355,0.712,4.0328]}
{"prompt":"Despite appearances , both your Shoulder Angel and Devil only want what 's best for you .","text":"Despite appearances, both your Shoulder Angel and Devil only want what's best for you. So, trust me.\nIn any event, the Devil's first time using his power, was in order to get the devil ( not my mother'devil ) to be his'mate '. Well, the devil wasn't having it, she refused to be the bitch. So, I guess the Devil had to resort to using power he did not possess... anger.\nI was just wondering what part your family plays in your life? And you mentioned that you have to make your parents happy. Can you be in a relationship before you are single?\nThe devil will use the power ( anger ) he does not possess, such as the power of lust. It s true, I know the devil likes to control women, but at this point in your life, I don't think he has the power. You should be grateful to him that you are the only way he can be with a woman and not be with you. Well, it's his opinion, I am glad you know it and, most of all, it's your opinion ( of course you can trust me, you can take me at my word ).\n...and then I was there at his house the other day, talking to the'devil, about the kids. How about you?\nYes, your family is important for you. It is important for them to make you happy as well. You may be with a boyfriend or girlfriend but that is not going to mean you and your boyfriend or girlfriend are the only important people in the world. You must care for your parents also. When you are in a relationship you still owe your parents all your time and attention - they still have to live with you and your boyfriend or girlfriend is not replacing your parents.\nI have also been there at his house. I have done stuff for him, and he has done stuff for me. Like you said, he may treat his parents worse than you do.\nHow do you know that I am the only one who can take him at his word? I mean, how do you know I am capable of being faithful, considering he does not want me to be...and he may treat his parents worse than me?\nNo, I do not mean that, I mean, how do you know that he will not get angry at you one day and then have the power of anger???\nHaha, if he can kill me, and make me a slave he can make you whatever he wants. You will only be his. He will control your every move. You will not have the power to escape. Even if I can get him to make a deal with me, you are going to end up alone. I would rather you were dead. Like you said. Not the Devil and not me.","token_len":576,"entropy":[9.6533,0.9047,5.5646,7.968,10.7549,0.3234,9.5449,0.7459,6.9687,9.7099,8.1166,6.7827,1.9546,0.7733,0.0453,0.7998,0.6589,4.1135,1.8931,7.7187,0.4916,2.9324,1.6409,6.7037,4.2178,2.005,0.043,2.8387,3.8451,2.5171,4.6926,6.0076,4.2866,2.3049,3.5425,2.0398,4.2856,2.4029,4.6205,0.0911,3.3276,2.4668,6.4495,6.1985,11.1696,5.7998,5.8862,9.9578,8.472,3.2557,1.0494,4.5769,4.7765,12.7965,4.3929,13.0535,6.2119,0.2016,3.5022,1.7783,4.0572,0.0007,6.5527,1.4424,1.9245,5.0743,7.3552,0.6063,3.293,2.8452,5.8117,1.8117,2.2269,0.845,2.6895,2.5139,2.6739,0.6904,3.3867,1.1093,6.244,0.0421,3.6829,5.4082,3.4596,4.6772,0.4304,2.2569,5.3757,12.1651,1.8223,1.268,3.1131,3.6301,3.874,2.661,2.236,6.8646,5.7201,6.0595,3.3716,0.2272,2.0856,2.6161,2.5457,4.6288,3.705,4.4011,1.3977,1.3041,2.6105,3.8223,3.9578,3.1737,3.3138,1.2096,1.1425,4.809,0.4277,6.2536,5.0895,1.7412,1.5073,5.4321,1.0915,3.1585,6.6819,0.3839,0.6605,3.3963,4.2873,4.3563,5.1138,3.0652,0.725,6.3046,6.1643,0.4133,2.8228,2.8514,0.1989,0.4898,2.3305,6.2287,0.042,2.8871,2.0562,1.9388,5.9271,1.569,3.3449,10.1267,6.5784,1.841,2.8971,3.5308,3.3442,1.637,3.7431,1.0388,4.5682,2.4689,1.2598,0.5723,4.5653,2.4526,0.7518,2.386,3.9545,0.1674,0.3851,1.7935,1.917,0.0428,1.0785,1.4394,2.8607,1.7611,1.2168,2.4104,4.2332,3.7302,1.6661,4.6729,2.4571,1.6165,3.7579,1.1615,1.5236,4.083,2.4252,6.8987,1.539,0.4655,3.2555,4.3644,3.8264,0.835,3.5963,1.5259,2.6873,3.2947,3.4044,0.6983,6.402,0.1408,3.1398,1.9387,4.8657,6.8184,1.5875,2.4847,3.3432,3.943,1.8193,5.1938,2.0742,4.1696,5.552,5.1443,1.8414,0.0553,0.0498,2.8008,1.0222,1.6605,1.832,5.2922,5.7988,1.9066,3.3331,2.4454,4.024,1.2665,2.6316,3.1177,1.9233,5.3059,3.2036,4.1425,0.1246,0.0143,2.8823,0.8528,6.2698,2.7178,3.4037,2.7704,3.2325,6.2261,4.3191,3.7634,2.0031,5.5326,1.1486,0.597,1.7303,5.056,0.6559,2.6043,12.2864,0.1685,3.0675,3.2504,2.128,6.8318,1.1891,5.6029,3.6076,1.7586,1.9626,0.9003,3.9733,0.3852,4.7158,2.4525,1.4994,3.4461,3.53,1.3095,0.8514,2.8848,1.3089,2.3833,1.0809,2.1497,0.4884,4.2657,0.8406,0.1241,4.4535,0.4673,0.7203,2.9403,4.1761,1.8509,6.0801,2.1375,5.4508,1.1886,0.8424,2.8966,3.2175,1.1585,0.9644,4.5674,0.0136,3.8507,1.1312,6.1407,0.7997,5.0312,3.6448,0.0983,1.1081,3.5931,1.4676,6.5747,1.296,1.0274,1.4601,1.2227,0.3506,2.3799,3.6535,5.7961,0.7132,1.9045,3.7778,6.8006,0.7536,4.7284,0.9716,1.0698,2.7452,1.3329,0.183,2.5819,6.2004,5.5996,2.2358,0.3665,5.0026,2.197,2.9687,0.9696,3.8565,5.702,3.2989,4.9861,1.8065,1.2124,3.6302,0.9907,0.1032,1.7972,2.9182,3.1992,2.1473,0.0263,4.5934,2.5896,10.6398,2.1013,2.83,0.9524,1.5318,2.4621,3.2003,4.0608,2.3772,3.2212,2.639,1.4344,0.2022,3.4491,1.6495,2.3394,5.1306,6.5101,1.6917,0.5975,1.8439,2.9456,1.5073,1.6517,1.8241,1.9034,0.1378,0.2323,0.6114,5.6433,4.0483,1.1947,0.3252,2.0702,4.639,6.555,4.1863,1.2249,6.946,0.4904,1.6996,1.2656,0.8546,2.2498,4.1011,1.539,0.1268,2.9793,1.6987,3.4951,1.2762,2.6685,0.978,0.6955,0.8669,1.1334,3.4602,2.9026,2.4187,0.5123,0.0466,0.6943,2.2809,3.6027,0.2477,3.6847,1.4264,0.2267,0.2563,2.7258,0.9467,6.4536,0.1271,2.7888,6.3707,3.8823,8.5647,2.7577,3.124,0.3531,3.0327,2.0914,0.2255,0.9661,5.4451,5.7225,2.5622,3.56,2.4802,2.4514,0.2844,0.5869,0.2019,4.0548,0.9851,0.8951,4.3779,0.5148,1.7495,2.719,0.0871,4.7493,1.1832,4.3038,1.4548,1.7149,2.1353,2.5589,0.549,0.0655,0.0966,0.7446,2.2418,2.4827,1.9757,4.8162,1.9711,1.295,0.5699,7.2272,1.2373,2.0799,2.7764,4.6471,3.479,2.1655,2.4668,1.4892,8.2594,1.1465,5.8655,1.6531,0.5602,4.7882,1.8872,3.4777,6.3443,1.5244,1.2701,3.6836,4.2372,0.3289,3.8507,3.1741,5.0977,0.935,2.6299,3.1725,8.5921,0.7408,0.2696,0.9915,3.745,3.2711,4.3039,1.3872,4.1458,6.3393,2.5898,0.8778,5.6375,2.5134,5.1199,1.6503,1.0631,2.3494,0.7737,1.9162,2.2113,2.06,0.5045,0.6978,6.1167,1.7605,5.1791,0.3756,2.8965,2.9492,3.0519,1.6464,0.2573,4.0786,3.3787,1.4766,0.5792,0.9859,0.7007,3.4337,2.8339,2.3909,0.0129,5.0483,0.0792,5.2161,1.2054,2.5196,4.013,1.9089,2.6597,3.1637,4.2582,1.7064,6.3893,1.5104,0.2657,2.9708,5.8984,3.7141,4.1321,4.3493,0.7094,2.1239,0.4187]}
{"prompt":"You are in your last few days of the battle with Alzheimer 's .","text":"You are in your last few days of the battle with Alzheimer's. You may have had a bad day ; you may have had anxiety ; and maybe you have tried hard to do something that was difficult. You may have felt alone or unsupported. Many people in my family with dementia have felt like that. It is important to recognize that. This is not your fault, so don't be ashamed. This will pass.\nWhen you have a bad day, try to think about something good. Maybe it is that you spent time with those you love and that you felt appreciated. Or you ate a really delicious meal. Or something else that made you feel good.\nWhat we can make sure of is that you will get through this battle together without being isolated. I will be here if you need to talk. You can call me ( and leave a message ) anytime during the day, and I will talk to you as soon as I can. I have always been there for folks in our families who have dementia.\nWe may not have this in our lives for a long time, and we will share that together if there is a choice. We are stronger when we are able to care for our loved ones when we can. You don't have to get it all right. Some days I can do the dishes, but other days I have to leave the dishes on the counter, so you can clean them later. Some days you will be able to get up and stretch, but other days you are too incapacitated to do that. You should feel respected in both ways. I know that. You know this too.\nThink of me and my family as your family. Not because I am someone who gets along with you better ; just because I share your worries, your thoughts. I will be honest about what you need, but I will also not take your place as your primary caregiver. I would rather see you get tired and stay at home than drive you to my home. It is easier for me. I have my own struggles. When you are in the hospital I can get there quickly and spend some time with you. I would much rather spend that time with you than driving you.\nYou are lucky to have me. It is my purpose and my calling to care for my family, and I will do that with your help and support.\nToday I was thinking about all my favorite people in the world, including you. Who are the people you care about most in the world?\nYou will probably think of those you know and who you know in your family. Like my husband, my daughter and her children and her friends. My sister. She has a daughter, who works for a family friend, to take care of my grandkids while their father works. I am lucky to have a sister like that.

{"prompt":"Write me a story that is going to make me miss my ex . Bring out all those feels , I dare you .","text":"Write me a story that is going to make me miss my ex. Bring out all those feels, I dare you. And please don't forget to write more stories in here and don't worry about what other people think of this story, so if my rating is low I have no reason to make any comments. I hope someone sees this and wants to make this the next great story on here and if so thanks and good luck to everybody else. I have already checked out a few stories in here and a few of them were not as good as they could be and some of the ones that were not so good are on my unread count list too. I have read tons of stories, many people on here have asked me to give them good advice for writing a great story and for anyone who has ever written a good story I have just one advice. It is to remember the first person who wrote a great and funny story,he was a man and nobody asked him how he wrote a great story so I just told you to remember that and don't worry about what other people think. Good luck to everybody.\nWhen his love of a life ends in death, a young man decides to visit the beach to help clean up the mess made by his relationship and he discovers a series of hidden treasures that he may never have known exist, even though they are close to his home.\nThis is the first time i read this series, and i liked it. A good way to start a new series that is good.\nWidow's in search of adventure to find her missing daughter. Wants to go to Africa with her, but the girl's father is a big shot lawyer who doesn't want her to leave with a stranger. So she has to figure out how to get by. She is pretty good at it. Her husband was killed in a motorcycle accident and so she is taking care of her daughter and her mother, who is in her mid eighties. The daughter needs her. The little girl can be pretty tough. And that's the problem. But she doesn't want to leave her. The movie isn't that long but you get to see all the characters in the movie get to be something really special. What makes this movie so wonderful is how in the beginning, when they started, it didn't look like it would work, but it didn't. Just like life with us sometimes, it's not how we start but how we end it. There were a few parts during the movie that were a little uncomfortable like when she sees the woman who raised her with her brother and she is very close to him. But the movie made a positive impact and it made you feel good the way it did. I also think the storyline was pretty good. A movie you can watch again and again and again, and not get tired of it.","token_len":577,"entropy":[6.8903,1.4421,3.9001,3.001,3.0907,4.6159,0.099,2.1068,2.2048,7.047,2.0405,6.6807,1.2744,8.6202,5.5497,3.6492,3.1103,10.5547,2.2652,4.5173,7.0909,0.4067,0.9156,4.0384,3.7968,2.373,0.0004,2.6311,1.0441,3.8346,4.8608,2.5916,3.6925,6.6312,3.1548,5.5528,0.0005,5.1928,0.7909,3.3004,3.6733,0.3486,0.9587,1.5826,4.1372,1.9107,2.6043,4.5545,2.6137,5.9928,8.064,0.8129,2.8608,2.2468,4.9427,1.6137,2.8582,0.2293,4.6048,2.4353,3.0326,1.0193,2.0551,3.2931,5.5721,4.78,0.9382,1.3327,3.653,0.1237,3.4452,3.0307,4.6383,2.9055,3.2426,2.4372,4.8167,4.798,3.0441,3.8513,2.5073,7.532,3.8987,2.9287,0.2433,2.3586,3.9966,2.8846,1.0597,2.8014,3.4705,4.6193,6.6518,0.9505,2.63,0.8146,3.3714,2.9192,1.2847,1.418,4.7781,0.5448,2.7986,0.6879,2.6193,4.1172,2.409,0.6453,0.5749,3.1218,1.4749,1.7799,2.2771,4.0259,1.1126,2.3671,2.2787,1.4465,1.2616,4.0115,1.7495,0.2733,2.4647,4.3297,1.5453,9.1657,1.8364,7.8859,4.1951,4.3478,0.334,1.7818,2.7932,2.8208,6.6209,0.1708,2.1411,3.2377,4.5764,4.7741,5.5062,0.4278,1.4864,4.4959,0.7298,1.3537,3.6694,0.5944,7.432,7.1026,4.1804,3.4606,3.4068,2.797,0.2607,1.2364,4.1857,6.1344,1.0403,1.8996,2.9167,2.8519,0.5205,2.1077,0.3059,2.1539,2.8982,4.5985,4.1452,5.8342,2.1609,3.5601,0.7101,3.0644,5.6429,3.3972,4.0485,4.3977,1.9325,2.2179,1.4282,1.4521,6.8561,4.148,0.1354,2.3498,11.8674,2.9439,2.2371,4.3766,2.2797,6.4576,5.2276,0.4736,3.1732,0.733,2.9304,2.7551,0.8369,0.3327,4.0639,2.6334,3.0633,3.0527,4.3321,2.9108,1.61,1.6689,2.643,3.8841,0.0005,3.1297,0.6669,1.862,0.7666,0.0309,0.2369,2.1122,5.3398,0.2014,1.2135,2.6992,2.0458,1.5322,8.0868,7.9873,5.825,2.4942,4.6648,5.2869,6.3743,3.9951,3.1526,1.029,3.7155,3.1252,0.7512,4.348,0.2973,5.4089,2.2015,5.7975,2.7744,4.4736,5.9147,0.7644,1.4436,1.6893,5.046,0.3362,0.6913,6.1149,3.9162,2.471,4.0556,1.6586,6.66,0.0028,5.1883,1.8514,2.289,1.8486,4.8137,2.0375,1.6721,0.7657,6.6026,3.4995,4.564,1.5326,1.9628,1.2188,7.4732,1.1483,1.2748,2.9682,0.5393,3.2398,3.5342,1.6617,1.7253,2.1,2.5565,6.228,2.6401,1.4653,3.6353,2.2732,2.4917,1.0764,5.8992,0.5037,2.5003,4.8509,3.3017,4.4308,0.058,1.3299,1.9937,1.5796,3.1161,3.8934,1.6701,3.8186,2.7629,1.573,5.9505,6.5386,0.455,4.6002,5.8223,5.8374,0.1891,5.8841,5.5092,2.2881,1.4978,3.2678,2.79,1.3781,5.8447,6.8301,0.2469,3.3847,1.4622,5.9121,2.7462,0.3918,4.4543,1.2448,3.4958,4.3762,2.4105,2.7923,1.2853,2.1693,3.808,7.3413,7.2241,1.6416,3.8306,0.0003,1.2172,0.9922,0.7795,2.9045,5.4054,3.3979,5.5319,0.7573,3.3962,1.5095,3.799,0.4201,4.7414,0.0627,1.2225,0.0897,1.4326,5.7201,2.4246,2.4632,2.7508,6.2197,2.8378,0.5463,2.1328,2.4034,4.7243,4.3383,4.0149,4.6454,1.3708,0.9707,3.7487,0.0903,1.1115,3.7748,1.1516,2.1173,5.4474,1.3821,0.0148,1.7302,3.3538,2.198,2.3971,2.8399,2.395,2.6418,1.0269,2.9468,2.7682,2.285,8.4078,0.1808,0.5424,2.9459,3.9744,4.7062,2.8894,6.4519,2.9022,5.4282,0.5735,4.0962,3.0983,4.5521,2.9647,2.0189,3.9198,3.6002,1.0796,2.8945,2.991,0.8265,4.6754,1.6654,2.6249,0.0006,1.9136,0.3281,1.6859,1.3019,2.714,2.9483,6.8251,5.0684,0.0011,3.3424,5.8197,2.7126,3.9389,2.0162,1.7825,0.5463,3.7482,0.7177,2.7386,2.5156,1.3836,0.4572,6.4386,2.0223,3.5047,5.1358,4.3313,0.9469,0.5281,5.3292,2.8958,0.8012,1.5006,1.5447,5.8073,0.2564,2.3237,6.1177,0.9074,2.3475,2.6554,3.3817,3.2551,4.8823,2.3356,2.5716,3.6394,0.0005,3.3641,0.5148,2.8339,1.547,3.0958,2.7531,1.1279,1.8541,3.9045,0.0011,1.5993,5.9218,1.9816,6.4229,4.8811,6.4548,6.1855,1.7742,2.2861,2.3554,2.3467,4.7025,1.7859,4.9602,4.2596,0.881,0.2578,1.6349,3.8156,0.2881,4.0567,3.1279,1.7885,1.3875,4.4943,6.9185,0.3162,0.6103,1.108,1.3533,3.8389,0.5542,5.5202,6.172,1.9972,3.0102,5.2172,1.4359,5.7534,1.9162,6.4762,0.2715,5.2442,1.0187,4.1054,1.7777,1.9033,2.8707,3.8677,4.8172,0.3651,1.1065,1.2888,1.5022,2.4672,1.8145,4.025,3.3305,6.6181,1.5772,2.004,2.0592,2.0325,4.708,1.4711,3.424,6.9048,1.3022,1.5519,0.4223,0.6934,2.4469,4.4532,2.9332,1.9558,6.2931,1.5365,3.1431,1.3684,1.3327,4.5177,4.7058,5.3728,2.2467,1.5671,5.5178,0.368,0.1077,1.1949,0.6262,2.3351,1.9559,4.9257,3.1551,1.6274,0.2207,1.1435,0.6014]}

{"prompt":"You wake up in a maze with only one thought on your mind : Turn around and you die .","text":"You wake up in a maze with only one thought on your mind : Turn around and you die. But turn around, you get there... again.\nI dont really remember much from my childhood, so its hard to describe. I used to play outside with my mom, that is to say a lot of outdoors. But i think that after i got to be a bit older i remember going to the swimming pool at my school and playing football at a local park, on my street i was lucky enough to go up to a zoo with my family once and i used to climb on the big bear and just stare at it: I guess i'm one of those people who don't like to be alone...\nWe lived near the ocean, there were always plenty of options for activities, so i dont remember them much but i do remember eating fish fingers and chips at Tim and the guys at the beach ( I was probably 8 or 9 ), and the beach itself always looked like a fairytale, in one of the photos i have of that beach my mom is dressed all in white and my grandpa is in his best suit. I also remember going out there in the summer months and just sitting on the sand :)\nI was too young to remember my parents divorce and whatnot, and there was a lot of turmoil in my house during the early years ( at least there was for my siblings ), so I don't remember them well. I seem very happy however. I remember having a lot of friends ( the only thing keeping me from being a loner i guess ) and I don't remember being afraid of anyone, I guess it's because i was so small and that I was always happy and cheerful in the midst of my brokenness.\nI don't remember much from my childhood either, but my parents divorced a lot of times. I remember going to my grandparents home in North Wales, and having a playmate every weekend - my little brother and his best pal, and a sister and a best pal for her. They lived in a terraced house all themselfs and ran a B&B, and when they were not there, the animals ran amok. I don't think my dad, my mom went to college and everything, so they were probably pretty lonely. I believe i had them for an average age for my kindergarten.\nI had to move away soon after my father died, but a week after he died I felt my mom crying in my room and thought, \"Well, it's all over anyway\". I cried and cried all day for days on end and didn't come back for her until I was out of my element. At her funeral, I sat in a chair and could see her and my father, who I never met, on a long bench by the lake and thought, \"You guys could be together again\".","token_len":578,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,1.8557,1.9371,7.7936,3.249,4.1902,1.2514,6.2812,3.7477,1.0528,0.07,6.4101,9.6292,3.0645,0.8667,4.2427,5.3758,0.6641,4.0184,7.4825,0.4397,2.6113,1.6014,3.7933,5.6465,4.3751,6.9141,1.1077,2.3093,5.9354,7.4205,4.1634,2.9646,3.4236,4.4614,2.3261,3.4241,0.9819,2.9944,5.2744,1.9972,0.1406,3.6067,1.3529,1.2733,4.9534,0.02,2.6018,4.7762,2.204,0.8621,4.2243,1.6445,5.8324,2.2098,4.301,0.0239,3.8827,2.3829,0.2431,6.2231,1.1607,2.5157,4.6853,3.6589,2.3278,4.1757,2.3412,1.9505,2.252,4.5574,1.1644,3.4744,0.3165,0.8628,5.2463,4.2593,0.806,1.8248,5.8383,0.1186,3.4173,2.3067,2.4607,1.2282,2.9319,5.596,3.9164,2.7655,2.4021,2.7366,2.6004,5.7301,1.843,7.297,7.3135,2.0027,5.5651,0.7056,0.0516,4.0031,4.0504,0.6646,1.8502,6.7145,2.7542,0.8199,3.1718,7.1064,2.0501,2.1522,5.5208,0.0223,5.5788,2.8205,1.5362,4.9578,5.997,2.2149,4.6826,4.3625,0.3456,0.9065,7.3766,3.3956,3.4764,1.4716,3.9784,5.6511,0.2435,0.5753,1.587,0.6334,4.6451,0.0034,2.8266,1.1709,2.0793,3.4477,3.6229,1.5954,5.5148,4.3528,4.8689,1.6358,4.8425,1.909,4.457,1.1573,4.2654,5.8432,0.0491,7.5337,1.3176,6.1411,1.7228,3.0097,0.8239,6.6179,2.1735,6.4235,2.5447,3.3912,0.597,2.3172,0.2012,6.1441,3.2643,10.6369,1.4307,6.2232,2.9507,10.0204,4.2674,3.4129,4.3284,1.827,1.2109,3.3165,4.1164,6.7043,3.2639,5.029,4.8619,1.4331,0.0998,6.9216,2.7237,3.8962,3.8298,3.7345,5.6283,3.4047,1.4086,0.9961,8.1221,0.4282,0.0007,2.5322,4.9835,5.3995,1.1218,0.3912,4.5963,1.3027,3.2508,2.1798,4.4003,2.4908,5.9994,2.0702,3.4126,6.4648,5.2467,0.7111,1.0881,1.3442,3.8154,5.5998,0.1751,1.1965,2.7243,1.9474,4.9893,2.9173,1.6234,2.2279,2.8697,0.4439,2.4943,2.8846,4.6627,2.7878,0.796,2.3723,4.3764,1.2249,4.1321,3.3893,1.8016,0.2761,2.5487,9.0623,0.8115,1.468,2.5762,6.1678,0.8627,0.4424,0.8611,3.6865,2.8255,10.9692,2.7494,5.4771,6.981,0.7752,2.9033,4.6694,0.9365,1.8839,1.0596,0.1469,5.5696,1.6945,0.4561,5.664,4.5305,1.8532,2.8613,1.2611,3.866,6.1672,1.5785,5.0079,0.5433,3.4559,2.3549,4.5322,3.9511,1.802,2.8099,2.7082,0.0072,0.7923,3.3088,4.6836,1.2964,1.5516,7.5976,4.7383,2.4348,7.706,2.1815,1.4738,2.2688,3.8087,1.0537,1.6332,0.032,3.0614,3.7279,4.3741,3.0205,2.9932,6.5338,0.1326,0.8547,2.1494,2.4139,6.5682,0.839,4.6663,2.1859,2.7292,0.6754,3.3002,3.9512,0.0046,1.0244,2.9707,4.7881,0.7719,2.2173,1.5956,2.5998,3.4666,2.5451,1.5379,1.3943,1.0609,1.7188,2.5718,3.5165,1.3415,4.7347,4.3691,1.3786,1.7751,4.3006,2.1121,6.0179,3.8845,1.4147,4.9367,0.0028,3.205,8.9969,6.4788,0.4341,0.988,1.1681,2.8034,0.0052,0.7093,1.8255,2.8926,0.6078,0.3198,2.6822,0.5833,1.5712,3.2976,2.2406,2.3524,3.4349,2.5425,1.4537,1.0307,1.8197,1.3242,1.8477,2.8409,0.3448,3.2657,3.4015,4.018,2.3837,5.468,3.6411,1.8436,1.6457,3.8806,1.0118,7.3393,1.513,6.6381,3.4131,5.7554,3.8013,5.2296,1.1537,1.9165,2.7844,4.7597,4.8211,2.0142,2.4954,3.1376,4.1857,1.5933,1.3249,5.5628,4.0232,4.1804,3.9311,2.621,3.659,3.9433,0.9273,0.9359,7.4335,0.7698,0.4658,6.1296,7.5081,6.1364,4.9892,2.15,7.1182,1.2874,9.0399,0.4389,0.3325,2.3522,1.5484,3.4514,1.7999,2.1257,4.6439,2.6372,1.7846,3.6908,5.8232,3.9456,6.5302,0.0383,1.7512,1.6342,2.7358,0.0022,3.3377,2.4591,2.5739,4.6989,2.0095,2.3444,7.2887,0.5329,3.7816,1.7262,7.0407,1.253,2.0063,3.9145,1.8422,4.1659,2.8928,4.7772,1.5442,1.4495,5.6345,3.0674,3.1626,6.5547,4.2138,4.6731,4.3302,4.3645,5.2381,1.6483,7.8053,3.2164,0.9504,1.0025,4.5099,2.9132,3.8956,4.1464,5.4954,0.2897,1.453,3.0943,1.6314,0.8038,2.0626,6.0091,5.5046,1.3665,2.5501,0.5779,2.0093,5.8921,4.3174,3.9212,5.6903,2.6933,0.7948,2.3861,2.4359,5.3572,2.5986,1.1681,4.1189,1.1169,3.1189,0.577,3.35,0.9261,7.136,2.5587,1.1846,7.0213,3.2637,1.5965,3.0101,1.2197,4.1998,3.3581,2.8657,0.0113,2.1461,4.369,0.0015,4.7325,1.4784,2.5434,6.2864,4.0631,2.1897,0.873,5.486,0.2469,2.6418,5.3862,0.9459,4.6126,7.3539,0.8198,1.3197,2.0363,4.6382,1.514,2.5682,2.4954,1.2429,6.356,1.9545,1.1637,4.7137,2.3199,3.5739,2.4657,2.7295,3.6351,3.1635,1.2703,0.8579,4.5376,2.6158,4.5345,4.023,5.5394,0.5118,3.6326,3.2401,4.2498,1.154,0.1971,4.8189,4.9396,5.0484,2.4604,3.7818,3.1226,1.8696]}

Even with all the latest, best technology and crew at your disposal, you haven't found them, until you detect their distress signal coming from inside a black hole.'We are a rescue operation for a ship whose captain's sent a distress signal, requesting assistance.\n''Please send someone,'the captain's voice comes through the radio.'This is urgent, my name is Toshio Nakamura, and this is my space craft, EVA-1.'' The ship is a UFO, like the one I found in New York.'' Right about now.'' That was a long year ago.'The UFO's radio operator seems to be getting more frustrated.'The problem is, sir,'the operator says.'I can't scan it for a damaged star ship.'' Well, what kind of scanners do you have, on board?'' Oh, sir, we have just the basic technology, sir, and now, with all the work they have had on this ship, I can't find even a small crack.'' The crew members are going to be very suspicious, you know.'' Maybe so,'the other man says.'But we'll give it a try.'' Good, then...'' Wait, Captain, please,'the operator says again.'Are there any other UFO in the area that might be a suitable vessel to take the wreckers to?'' I'm sure there are,'the other man says.'And one of them...'' No, sir.'' There is another one.'' Can we try it?'' Yes, yes.'' Thank you, sir.'' Yes, sir.'The Captain of the UFO, however, did not give his okay for the mission.'Let's not waste space,'he says.'We do have enough room on this ship, and we are not going anywhere.'And it seems that the mission never took place. There's still a small doubt as to what happened, but from what is reported on various news programs of what happened to, say,'Oumuamua, we can say'a small hole'was spotted. And while this black hole has been called both a'surprise'and 'an enigma', that is because it has so far only been detected once ( and that was when the spacecraft'BepiColombo'was orbiting Mercury ) and no other probes have been sent around it.\nEven less is known about the black hole. So far, only from the Earth's observations were we able to determine it's existence. Even though they have never detected the'dark side', which is supposed to consist of a huge amount of energy, there is an idea that if it exists, the'dark side'may be just a black hole or something else that just happened to be on our space station's trajectory.","token_len":579,"entropy":[5.2846,3.4964,7.32,1.3413,2.4729,6.5803,2.3388,5.2011,2.1497,10.7631,3.9709,0.0988,0.3055,3.9125,1.6857,7.0337,0.0316,1.7624,6.049,1.1816,4.7181,0.5563,5.8653,0.1838,0.9466,6.1487,3.4898,1.9422,0.8496,7.2682,6.0263,3.895,1.7807,1.7418,5.4082,6.411,1.3211,0.1601,0.1576,0.7995,6.1401,0.0003,2.1888,4.6895,3.9783,7.2728,0.73,8.771,3.613,4.2355,0.4578,6.2999,0.2306,5.2403,1.9096,4.6455,0.2884,7.0458,10.0231,3.6225,3.181,5.9074,2.578,2.9819,2.2281,2.1484,3.8807,2.9422,3.5981,7.4826,2.7234,0.3425,0.2471,2.5897,6.5398,2.2635,1.9923,4.8216,12.8077,6.4291,4.0605,5.6079,8.7472,7.3011,1.1115,3.5873,1.0631,4.6569,1.59,0.9914,2.4775,4.5774,4.7162,0.58,6.657,1.5228,4.5551,5.9132,0.1279,10.5917,2.0269,3.5907,1.6626,1.019,0.8092,3.34,0.3966,1.9073,5.9469,4.8857,1.6513,9.1148,1.1626,1.8883,2.6771,5.9018,5.6304,2.2961,1.7026,3.4323,8.2887,1.7083,5.8408,1.3296,1.046,3.9061,4.0304,1.6918,6.1723,1.0481,3.4296,8.8087,5.4778,0.4399,8.1317,5.2049,2.8832,2.26,2.6768,7.567,0.1702,5.7049,3.6251,4.4348,2.5751,5.5352,5.1575,6.9832,0.6148,0.6657,4.9065,2.4452,5.1991,3.6802,2.7482,5.0522,0.5779,1.0395,7.5834,3.51,2.2954,3.8626,2.1647,3.1197,1.9643,2.6395,0.3729,7.7907,2.4238,3.2287,2.4504,10.8746,5.5057,1.5278,4.3997,4.9106,0.4298,3.879,3.7045,0.004,7.566,1.5019,0.3254,1.0579,2.1799,6.5062,3.3133,3.5379,1.1242,4.2904,0.5195,5.131,0.8311,3.2119,1.1561,5.8832,3.2193,4.9132,4.4605,1.9049,2.8789,1.8768,2.1461,4.536,2.8897,4.2478,2.7633,0.7268,5.7528,4.7832,2.1396,5.8187,2.2532,1.7032,1.5194,0.3341,2.1968,1.7992,1.4618,2.5412,5.662,1.287,4.3707,7.0578,3.2733,2.92,3.5774,3.6198,1.8785,5.0202,0.4436,2.1783,3.8542,5.6527,1.5904,4.1539,0.4584,3.4276,6.8691,5.2386,4.5966,1.4533,5.73,3.2016,0.5507,2.5649,3.5744,2.953,3.174,4.5367,2.2533,0.5397,0.8489,4.4117,5.3842,1.2026,2.3092,5.2385,1.553,7.1716,0.6481,6.9357,1.0786,4.3029,5.274,1.3262,3.6464,0.8216,4.213,2.3589,5.1848,3.3667,0.6093,1.5407,5.3195,4.7121,0.8992,2.0997,3.0572,3.6111,0.5392,3.0653,5.042,4.408,1.6164,2.8419,2.9693,7.8249,4.6436,1.9124,1.8315,0.1897,3.2984,2.0133,2.7601,1.581,0.5357,3.5957,0.4823,1.4797,0.1076,0.3931,1.9174,3.8037,5.7418,0.838,0.9786,4.3548,0.9621,4.6876,0.3808,2.0825,4.8856,4.1888,1.6498,3.3638,2.5686,4.2536,6.8031,1.8349,4.8197,2.6573,1.547,0.0426,2.5409,0.4243,5.019,3.6905,6.3143,0.1786,0.8309,0.8287,2.4795,5.3392,0.363,1.1483,2.3793,2.2272,4.7359,2.221,0.4545,2.4346,2.5903,4.264,0.1735,5.6746,0.7806,3.7285,3.1943,9.6637,3.9289,1.2665,2.7397,2.7028,6.1937,0.4047,3.97,3.8885,5.4472,3.8609,3.3876,0.4202,2.541,2.9333,4.5282,1.5739,4.5931,5.4535,2.4029,2.2385,0.6036,1.4992,2.0311,1.1634,3.2216,2.9756,0.8237,2.7007,1.7824,4.3077,3.9535,3.2282,1.2696,1.2965,4.3722,7.3212,3.1485,0.6023,1.6566,3.9543,2.2454,3.9093,1.5826,4.6527,6.8627,1.7931,0.0036,2.0067,1.0294,1.7298,0.841,5.9932,0.6566,4.6874,4.4203,2.4861,5.4931,2.2126,4.4352,5.0607,3.8896,0.7847,2.5946,7.6902,2.9044,6.8671,6.52,7.0233,1.762,6.9291,4.5136,1.0786,2.6661,4.0188,4.0199,7.852,5.6962,3.9486,5.3881,5.2502,6.3955,6.9603,3.0208,3.0963,5.813,3.0533,8.5357,0.0349,3.1536,1.5887,5.3161,8.3194,2.1298,10.2583,7.9857,3.3145,3.4152,2.0081,3.7664,3.8677,7.979,0.1636,1.4892,4.2049,1.8586,5.6588,1.2787,2.1594,4.4895,2.4914,3.3002,0.5717,3.101,2.4468,6.0866,8.8058,2.8061,2.1069,3.3448,1.335,4.5897,7.0389,8.1306,7.3439,2.3852,8.1238,0.4725,1.0901,2.9564,5.4805,6.6181,6.6451,1.7294,3.3592,1.6625,4.4959,0.4854,0.499,4.0849,6.3544,1.5586,1.032,4.1034,7.6025,7.2149,2.6452,0.191,0.2526,0.6838,4.2644,0.0653,2.3483,4.6849,1.7,0.7525,3.3008,7.5203,1.6136,4.6472,1.6701,6.8657,5.5433,2.4161,0.4443,0.0137,2.8118,4.3216,2.846,2.6767,0.7983,4.8489,2.5425,4.7468,2.1168,4.0045,4.1756,3.1489,12.9223,7.9951,8.2642,8.1665,5.8956,1.0097,5.9417,0.0104,6.6607,0.077,1.396,3.9709,3.6193,0.0074,3.5292,0.991,2.6149,1.1416,4.2605,4.0087,0.3984,3.7929,1.9163,3.9346,0.784,2.8885,9.2146,0.0397,0.5534,10.0473,9.2355,4.3176,5.0124,1.6738,4.3555,0.0294,4.3908,0.811,3.0568,3.7588,5.5407,3.683,0.6367,1.1359,3.751,2.684,5.6983,1.3222,3.7776,5.806,0.8205]}

I tried copying the file of same path with the.gyp file to my project. I am not working much with NodeJS and I don't know the basics of creating a file and executing it from VS Code.\n\nA:\n\nSo I finally resolved this problem. While I was trying to see if there is any difference and if I am running the same code the output file is not getting generated same in both situations. I came to know after checking the same. This output file is generated and then passed to the NodeJS script to be executed. So I have to build the same to execute only. \nIt is not like the JavaScript is executed when the NodeJS is running but when the Gypfile is built and passed to build folder, then this file is executed. Also the file contains the arguments we need to pass to the NodeJS script.\nHere is my working snippet\nnpm run build\ncd build\nnpx --verbose node-gyp \\\n<path to node-gyp libs> \\\n<path to project>\/gyp.bat  --project <path to project>.gypproj \\\n<input.csproj> \\\n<output.obj> \\\n<output.res> \\\n<nodejslibpath>","token_len":579,"entropy":[6.4314,6.6985,2.5859,12.5558,5.7864,7.8749,10.0182,3.3494,4.6561,8.3668,4.0319,5.8433,1.6782,4.7914,5.9889,3.0142,7.5197,5.7284,5.2102,8.6545,0.2451,0.5035,8.4907,3.5812,0.0539,6.7424,0.3209,0.6928,4.2991,0.2721,3.7043,0.2376,5.3605,1.0405,0.0009,0.0768,2.4703,2.543,6.5211,0.2148,0.6582,2.0247,0.3876,5.9616,1.1025,8.8426,10.945,3.7544,0.5318,5.7643,0.0189,2.2342,12.2892,7.2854,4.6587,6.1904,4.6145,4.9939,4.8863,2.8275,5.1366,2.9658,10.3047,3.6657,0.6723,5.6514,6.6949,2.6202,6.1972,7.7252,3.8295,1.4672,5.2655,4.0103,0.2204,0.0029,0.0004,0.0022,0.0096,0.0486,0.0044,0.0134,0.0049,0.0398,0.0075,0.0006,0.0039,0.0168,0.4872,0.0079,0.0014,0.0238,0.0901,0.0045,0.0545,0.0053,0.1905,0.4584,0.1457,0.0007,0.0052,0.0014,0.0066,0.2879,0.0859,0.0048,0.0036,0.0083,0.0027,0.0148,0.0858,0.0588,7.156,7.2413,4.9415,5.9108,2.7167,0.2299,3.9961,3.3446,2.3523,6.0128,5.7598,0.6784,2.889,6.2749,8.5031,7.5695,0.8881,3.7043,6.8657,5.4173,6.5996,7.169,0.0605,4.536,3.7282,1.6788,0.1487,0.003,5.0258,16.671,1.4126,0.5907,12.5948,13.627,5.1901,7.1039,8.5347,9.9283,8.5486,1.6472,5.4457,0.7491,4.9116,4.552,7.1354,0.713,6.5613,9.7524,0.0305,2.3613,2.2738,1.3479,6.6443,3.3797,3.1497,0.3282,7.1711,5.7697,6.9193,0.0271,0.7989,0.4056,0.3969,7.8832,1.4439,8.0336,0.005,0.0018,0.7888,0.2748,0.0378,2.3209,0.1747,9.6895,1.5732,0.5311,0.1258,3.8938,0.5796,8.2842,3.0185,0.397,0.0996,7.2837,0.692,1.3478,1.0563,4.9885,2.313,0.5466,0.0531,2.243,0.3874,0.574,0.323,0.9952,2.1409,0.2785,0.0464,6.2165,0.8321,7.7717,0.1631,0.175,0.3056,2.6158,0.2175,0.0326,1.443,7.3048,0.1689,0.0764,0.0663,0.5346,0.138,9.9139,2.1139,3.2552,0.3217,0.9341,0.1954,0.881,0.3154,1.1065,1.2177,5.2497,0.9404,0.0426,0.0371,0.0312,0.3702,0.2085,1.7953,0.5388,0.2945,0.0326,0.054,0.0577,0.0222,0.501,0.2679,1.5553,2.9952,0.0071,0.2514,0.0579,0.008,0.0083,0.5649,0.2236,0.822,0.616,3.3929,0.1196,9.7032,0.6594,0.2501,1.1486,0.6656,2.4901,0.0489,6.3206,0.5343,0.2793,0.5783,0.3507,1.1454,0.0102,0.0026,3.2213,0.5166,0.3177,7.8679,3.6384,4.5618,0.2931,8.2849,7.0714,7.8222,1.2776,6.967,3.014,0.7088,9.4691,0.9986,0.0003,3.7015,1.5339,3.3273,1.0495,3.7319,2.1855,5.4773,2.57,2.3258,4.0644,1.4602,1.5283,5.0665,7.0109,1.2634,2.8069,5.6001,7.6069,4.2253,3.6344,1.996,8.3781,6.2575,0.9299,0.9246,3.8242,2.8342,4.0033,2.6098,1.7531,3.17,1.6147,5.7231,7.7372,1.8361,3.614,1.8166,2.7482,1.518,2.4031,0.0016,1.1481,3.3842,6.4654,0.602,5.6153,1.6962,3.2417,3.8475,5.8054,0.827,3.8017,9.8495,0.2453,0.6353,1.7501,0.0002,5.1508,5.2273,2.7691,0.0002,4.0077,1.8569,6.6187,6.0835,1.7646,1.0046,1.1683,7.1688,1.1664,2.1634,2.5103,0.1457,5.4829,1.1197,2.4475,1.3237,1.4041,3.5287,4.7158,2.3971,1.6938,2.563,5.3817,2.2134,1.6795,2.2978,5.358,5.2495,4.6896,2.0219,2.6775,4.7808,4.6912,7.1406,5.0411,2.6273,6.0465,0.4134,1.7775,6.421,1.357,5.8846,5.6069,4.6612,1.4442,4.8846,4.5915,5.854,7.7683,1.0831,1.1528,2.8339,3.9567,3.7008,4.8777,0.6001,1.3382,3.4923,0.837,4.1256,3.449,1.8213,1.6406,0.7627,3.4521,1.3577,3.0716,1.4066,6.2401,1.5121,2.414,5.2516,4.3685,5.8957,3.7738,9.9616,2.1665,17.6804,1.347,1.8294,4.4233,2.4257,5.6755,2.4929,4.6935,3.6353,1.5349,3.5661,0.137,2.9113,1.3602,2.948,1.9763,1.0756,7.9609,0.3978,0.956,0.4509,4.2309,2.5603,4.9408,0.4886,5.6593,6.7328,3.7956,3.8847,4.1531,3.4762,0.6438,3.0499,0.8347,4.784,2.1319,3.7344,5.3814,1.3164,5.4741,6.306,0.945,0.4352,3.1506,0.5324,1.6915,1.2008,0.0674,0.6586,0.9566,0.9591,18.6023,0.419,2.6201,4.805,6.6631,2.9899,17.4394,0.0462,2.0289,0.542,1.8669,20.3807,0.4325,1.1765,4.8309,10.1464,5.1877,4.8695,0.0408,6.151,1.3266,0.0772,0.0208,6.5521,3.108,11.433,3.8946,2.2928,3.6507,0.6157,0.0411,0.0052,7.8458,2.8593,0.7861,3.1191,0.0904,8.1011,1.571,0.1397,5.7592,2.3826,3.6875,3.4171,0.733,1.6094,6.6191,6.9575,8.4931,5.056,5.4119,1.9464,0.1247,0.7821,8.2056,1.2564,1.8692,0.125,0.0044,1.406,0.0591,3.0748,9.3419,5.2406,3.2913,0.0198,0.0011,0.4386,2.0822,0.0582,3.9446,1.1126,0.0788,4.2704,0.068,0.7202,0.0343,5.6924,0.9438,0.2323,0.1504,0.1015,0.3631,0.0275,4.2171,7.48,10.1854,6.708,1.6247,6.1934,1.0863]}

No sane human being questions why. Tonight, a girl breaks through the beach barriers. She decides to enter the water. But a dog from the beach barks. She turns around and is instantly attacked by the dog. The dog comes in a furious and relentless attack.\nThe man on the other side of the wall runs over and picks up the dog. Together they push the dog back a foot into the sand and let it run toward his prey. The dog goes back and attacks the girl. He runs over toward the girl, stops to lick her feet, and goes back again. The dog comes over and pulls the girl against the wall until she is on her back. Her legs are under water and she cannot move.\nThe man behind the wall holds the dog in place with his arms and takes a deep breath. He lets go of the girl and turns to face the dog. He lets the dog lick his face and then slowly releases the girl\u2019s hands. She goes back to the beach and he goes to the water.\nThe dog is very pleased with himself and stands up, licking his lips. He starts for the woman. The man rushes at him. The dog rolls around on the beach.\nA young boy tries to catch the dog off guard by pushing the end of the barking dog in a straight line toward the boy. The barking dog turns to face the dog that just attacked.\n\u2018We can\u2019t help them.\u2019 The man says to the girl. \u2018We have to let them off on their own. They have made their own choice. The ocean was always open, always waiting.\u2019\nThat is what our oceans tell us. That is our message. How can we live with what we can\u2019t escape? How can we forget or pretend we can escape it?\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged Ocean, Ocean Stories, Ocean Stories Online, Ocean Stories Online Vol 2 by SirenLilFae. Bookmark the permalink.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be weaned from their bottles by this age \u2013 but that\u2019s tough for me.\nI\u2019m at work now on a full-time basis, so there\u2019s no way for me to sit with my 2 1\/2-month-old while he nurses. Our family has a full schedule including napping, play, and a very young sister who doesn\u2019t require a bottle after the first year.

{"prompt":"A fortune teller has a crystal ball that only sees the past , but shows it with 100 % clarity .","text":"A fortune teller has a crystal ball that only sees the past, but shows it with 100 % clarity. Her clients ask her to take them to the place where she saw it in the past in order to make sure it will come true.\nA famous writer has decided to stay alone as he doesn\u2019t dare to marry a woman that he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t need any woman in his life because he has one special book where he can share his feelings with the reader all over again.\nThis story was so good. The story tells you of a young girl who works as a waitress and always gets the same book from her boss. The boss takes the book from the book case and leaves it on the table. The girl reads the book all day and starts to fall for the book characters. This book is about a book and its characters. But that\u2019s all you really get out of the book. Its a real treat to read a story that combines a great story, characters, romance and humour.\nThis book is called A book of One\u2019s own. A book of One\u2019s own was published as a novel. It was first published in 1987 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom. It won several awards including the Costa First Book award the Guardian Fiction Award.\nThis is the only book I have read by this author, but from what I saw all her books were very good. She had an exceptional talent to write.\nThere are three main characters, a book of one\u2019s own and a woman\u2019s love. What makes this novel interesting are the intertwining stories and the dialogue.\nThis book is on a young woman who has a book in her hand of which he has lost the bookmark. The book seems so exciting. But is it really? Is this her book? Where are the real characters? There are two main parts to this story. One part is the journey of the book and a story about a woman who lives alone in a house in France.\nThe book tells the story of an English girl who is going to stay at home with her aunt and her aunt\u2019s husband. The husband, his wife, his children and one niece go on a holiday to Italy. Along the way the husband starts losing his memory and the aunt decides to leave him at one of the villages along the way.\nThis is a story about two people whose lives are intertwined. One, the book and the other, its author.

{"prompt":"So , you humans just drew imaginary lines on your planet and fought real wars defending them ?","text":"So, you humans just drew imaginary lines on your planet and fought real wars defending them? So, what I told you was real? The big red line, that was real? The big green line was real? The big blue line? Big yellow line? Or the big brown line? And if you are serious about protecting the world of your imagination, why are you trying to kill all the ones who are trying to make it a better place? Why are you killing the ones who are trying to make it a safer place for you?\nIn their defence, the earth is a small world at this point, if you go to any middle eastern country, and there are people wanting a better life for themselves, then you will have to kill them to make the dream of these people, and to make the dream of this other people ( even if they are not the same nation ), or are they going to just leave or just kill them if someone else invades them first?\nThe only thing I am seeing you seem to have done is that you have started making imaginary lines in your head, and that is not going to help anyone, because it is just you and us, right? So, I am not going to let you think you are doing something that is supposedly protecting us or making the world better for all of us.\nThere is no need for you to protect us because we have a long way to run to get to where we are trying to reach, so I am not a part of that fantasy. The big lines you have drawn is going to get us into our own mess, which we will make the mess, we will be stuck between the lines, and it is pointless to fight these imaginary lines, I am not going to let you take away my freedom, or take away another one of my right, of being who I am, of speaking up for what I believe that it is right or wrong, even if their beliefs are the things you are telling me to stay away from.\nNo. I feel like the best way to protect me and other people now is to learn to stand against what I don\u2019t believe in, that is why I have posted this and also created this site, so that I can share these ideas to other people, it is not a good idea to post your name, so I won\u2019t be worried if you want to stop visiting and reading, I will always keep writing, I never thought that this world could be so confusing to me.\nI get that you are really scared because you don\u2019t understand any of this, but you are only doing what you are doing because of your fear, that what you are doing is making this world a better place, or that you are trying to save it. I am not scared, I am done with the big blue line, I have done the work.","token_len":581,"entropy":[2.5773,3.317,11.0202,5.1674,9.3798,9.1799,1.6597,2.2717,1.8696,7.6126,1.896,7.8223,6.5038,1.8076,10.1878,2.6459,3.874,4.5265,1.439,2.4226,5.4897,6.0095,0.2699,1.2953,5.1017,2.4643,4.2739,6.454,5.6046,1.3119,3.0069,3.0389,2.1485,3.4546,2.6712,2.7622,2.2832,2.8721,0.2723,2.6772,0.4993,0.2545,1.9777,0.7996,0.7469,0.1827,3.1597,7.329,3.0929,0.7479,0.515,5.2955,2.1391,1.2259,4.4414,0.2906,0.3289,2.5488,3.4841,0.5824,4.5606,4.7491,0.4301,4.4577,1.8598,2.9756,6.1618,2.4376,5.0726,0.3692,3.4118,2.6731,0.2655,3.8314,0.0584,4.2586,3.5564,1.6225,6.7656,0.9756,1.7461,2.9011,0.0186,3.426,0.9772,3.2215,2.0808,0.2518,0.7402,2.9302,0.6019,0.0883,4.7387,2.2426,1.4127,0.2197,0.7966,0.8153,0.0123,1.0254,0.3327,0.5456,3.6636,0.0438,3.2567,0.926,0.9352,1.735,7.8092,6.0521,6.4319,0.4233,1.8241,6.9779,1.4358,2.1392,5.1601,3.2715,6.3452,3.3421,0.4931,1.2161,5.2046,0.6053,4.524,2.0708,3.2219,7.9246,3.9341,0.6539,1.0796,2.3262,2.8329,0.9617,2.5008,7.6291,4.5271,2.2503,0.7572,1.6444,1.3563,0.7466,2.8465,1.2199,2.1841,2.7271,1.5511,3.2791,0.8877,4.0674,1.6733,2.6566,6.6531,1.4629,6.195,0.5911,4.1788,2.269,3.2741,1.2824,1.2068,1.0151,0.1712,2.8044,5.6357,1.5901,6.4494,11.401,0.8163,1.5948,1.1244,2.2571,2.7982,1.5304,8.3673,4.5476,4.438,5.3347,0.8131,4.1406,0.0444,4.4706,4.3381,4.8982,3.6902,4.3791,1.2132,4.9368,6.5191,3.13,6.814,0.1614,2.9932,6.0478,0.633,1.4356,3.0591,3.7149,1.8937,1.9671,2.8452,5.8827,4.8544,8.9111,0.0948,2.7404,2.3466,0.4761,4.8131,0.7408,1.3357,4.2336,4.3187,4.7394,2.8182,3.3841,0.9146,2.723,1.5836,1.163,2.8229,1.4452,2.725,3.0628,0.0294,2.1633,3.3801,1.8649,1.6364,2.62,0.8745,2.47,4.5394,1.8106,4.8367,1.5214,4.4401,0.2221,2.8127,0.6431,2.9783,2.1504,2.2428,1.5214,0.012,3.6399,0.3782,4.0464,2.4634,0.6866,2.8568,1.6546,2.6321,1.1382,9.4156,6.3767,2.8776,2.7272,2.923,2.396,0.2743,2.0836,1.8462,3.4557,0.945,0.3907,0.8488,1.3738,4.7421,0.9033,1.5292,3.1412,1.3995,0.7206,0.1453,5.873,1.5268,3.413,1.5847,2.4039,3.3424,4.7255,1.1279,0.0463,7.3743,3.2259,2.6778,1.1647,2.8578,0.3627,1.1022,6.3057,0.0455,4.6675,1.4607,2.2948,2.7487,1.2754,0.9433,6.5349,4.3219,0.0244,1.464,5.0783,1.3823,3.7187,4.4084,7.0756,2.9864,1.7647,0.6328,5.1455,4.3238,0.0548,4.0909,2.0622,3.5177,4.4865,2.6778,5.603,0.9651,3.2217,2.9845,1.7154,4.0658,3.5062,3.7459,3.0232,4.4418,0.2279,3.3685,4.4823,5.3644,1.9764,2.5188,1.1276,0.9847,3.163,1.2259,7.632,1.4849,2.9076,5.1951,2.3112,0.9274,1.8,4.6608,0.7916,0.9666,0.8268,0.0114,1.6467,0.181,3.9839,2.3902,3.1772,3.0766,1.6208,2.8112,4.3231,0.0971,7.1738,3.3416,0.7275,0.9109,5.8554,2.4988,6.2166,3.9685,4.9513,0.4544,0.1921,1.0073,3.2975,6.3547,3.2295,0.9394,1.9415,0.7228,0.8095,5.5682,5.2975,0.3116,3.9757,4.6711,0.5509,1.3461,5.0145,0.3538,7.7174,3.9898,0.7969,4.0059,5.9548,1.5005,1.5455,3.7864,0.7495,1.9933,7.7392,0.5196,0.0092,0.7881,0.6517,5.108,3.2245,1.572,6.4763,1.5706,3.1221,4.6656,1.0625,0.388,2.0807,3.1162,2.5644,3.8362,0.4031,6.9826,0.31,0.3198,6.4933,1.2182,4.1039,4.6321,3.266,2.2285,5.6179,16.3626,7.2655,2.4023,1.691,2.4079,0.7735,3.0702,1.5756,2.8394,0.2822,2.5224,6.9886,1.7454,3.8845,5.1824,5.9667,0.734,4.0206,1.2909,2.2705,0.8316,2.1021,0.3694,3.4549,4.3924,2.0693,3.813,2.2205,0.1179,1.408,5.2917,0.6851,1.5215,2.3687,4.7362,0.8002,0.926,4.5802,3.5914,7.5823,1.9077,4.4397,1.6722,4.597,1.7365,0.2674,0.8966,1.6001,6.8748,2.8609,0.8337,4.3904,0.23,4.6632,7.8099,3.2125,3.9993,3.189,2.5091,1.3012,4.9579,2.7081,5.2186,2.6165,2.8213,4.6407,4.7251,1.6188,2.7744,5.1902,2.1985,0.8886,1.1342,5.228,3.2286,1.1157,1.1445,0.8136,1.7565,6.7311,1.3566,1.2142,0.9504,5.2922,3.9105,3.6756,0.964,3.1616,0.3345,0.1411,0.0144,2.2593,6.1123,0.2288,1.0726,0.7582,1.2288,2.2188,1.0605,4.9834,3.3881,1.8323,0.9056,1.1498,1.9053,1.3535,2.538,2.1004,2.5897,1.2324,3.1374,6.6631,0.3199,0.3836,0.1666,0.2515,3.8803,3.3294,0.6291,1.3476,0.2917,0.0152,1.5831,4.0961,2.847,1.0745,0.5235,2.983,0.0251,3.2606,1.1444,1.5604,2.4205,1.8022,0.9431,2.9226,2.1409,0.6575,0.4491,6.7093,0.9171,2.7447,6.0037,3.7559,0.3692,0.8912,1.4202,3.0584,3.0718,3.1848,5.3072,2.6614]}
{"prompt":"The quirk that you loved about that special someone now drives you insane","text":"The quirk that you loved about that special someone now drives you insane; it\u2019s their new favourite thing about you. The man\/woman you once thought to be the most wonderful person on the planet is now living in torment, and the only thing causing it is you.\nThis is another sign that you have a deep-seated and irreconcilable rift with your ex-girlfriend and will not get back together with her.\nYou just can\u2019t stop thinking about that guy who you had a fling with, and that even after losing him for another girl, you can\u2019t even stop dreaming about him.\nYou have a serious problem with self-loathing. Everything about you from your hair to your teeth to your dress to your smile is disgusting and is your worst nightmare.\nYou feel like a failure as a woman because you are not a good cook or a great manager. All you can manage is how to get out of bed each morning.\nThis is one of the worst signs that you will never, ever recover from your breaking up with your ex partner.\nYou spend hours thinking about a guy that you met and had a fling with just to make things more bearable.\nIf you have a girlfriend, you\u2019re so over her that you can even have an affair with her ex-boyfriend, even if she knows about it. You don\u2019t care, as you know deep down it\u2019s only a little thing between us, and you also know that she will never forgive you anyway.\nYou are going to see all the exes of the girls with whom you\u2019ve been romantically involved. You are going to follow them on Twitter and send them tweets asking if they\u2019re all right, and you are also going to follow their girlfriends on social networking sites. You\u2019re going to keep an eye on how every relationship on their friends list turns out.\nThere\u2019s no way you would be able to live with a mind like that unless it had been the result of a nervous breakdown.\nYou think about things like how your kids should wear socks of different colours and how you feel about having a dog or a cat.\nAnd it\u2019s so much worse after you\u2019ve dumped her or she\u2019s dumped you, you start thinking about those times when she left you hanging, and there\u2019s no way you can get over it now that the relationship\u2019s over.\nAnd that\u2019s how you feel when you realize that you and the woman you love the most are not going to live it out together.\nWell, it\u2019s time for you to get over your insecurities because they\u2019re making you miserable. No man wants to date a woman who thinks all about herself.","token_len":581,"entropy":[9.1974,2.5743,3.2614,4.9733,10.6216,2.3538,4.0109,8.047,6.0091,7.1231,7.7898,0.9388,2.5374,5.3484,2.0432,16.1077,8.6145,2.1335,6.1588,6.8303,6.6545,2.7297,2.2566,0.6693,0.7625,4.0945,5.2696,6.7927,0.5511,1.8445,3.8892,2.4356,2.6818,0.182,1.9477,1.9074,4.3836,1.3286,3.8013,1.0563,0.0872,1.7125,0.6549,6.0057,1.2726,7.7681,2.0034,2.2839,3.3268,2.3656,1.1132,7.7052,1.8994,0.4505,2.2507,0.5748,2.1087,7.5305,1.131,5.9505,5.4375,0.7837,1.5746,2.6657,2.7916,3.3077,3.331,0.3059,0.0072,4.2134,6.6401,1.5546,0.0006,0.0287,6.8042,1.0595,1.2799,4.458,0.8,1.9813,2.5758,5.3325,2.6819,4.1244,4.3572,1.188,1.839,0.1836,1.0984,1.7573,1.9878,5.6566,2.2048,4.955,0.6176,0.0684,2.5726,1.2839,0.4894,2.7637,3.856,2.9322,2.7069,3.754,2.3348,7.1249,0.1442,0.0771,2.8815,1.4026,3.2902,6.3247,3.0007,5.8929,2.7186,3.0831,6.5572,5.637,0.9689,0.6748,3.3189,3.2013,0.0098,0.0097,4.0294,3.1152,6.4495,0.5723,0.962,1.1741,0.7666,1.445,2.9097,2.281,6.4168,1.2041,0.7834,5.6603,0.1839,3.1346,0.0,1.2911,6.9415,1.8416,0.5751,7.193,1.169,5.7926,0.9039,0.1904,5.5852,2.0661,0.222,5.2931,1.6556,0.2287,4.9319,1.8523,6.401,1.5696,5.3528,5.3445,4.4508,1.5825,0.3322,0.8972,1.0985,4.0673,1.8676,2.2832,4.1989,3.8374,0.5283,2.5323,2.7468,0.6043,1.9797,2.7751,2.4425,1.9394,5.9302,1.8556,0.78,3.7135,5.3162,0.7057,5.2385,1.2115,1.8434,4.7881,0.2852,5.3015,1.2912,2.9645,3.2345,0.1012,2.7339,5.5949,1.2077,2.3428,0.9566,3.7881,0.6069,3.1694,0.3883,0.3752,2.9153,4.7501,1.1154,0.2282,2.5813,1.7655,4.8734,0.0285,5.1395,0.2685,2.0452,7.6895,0.7255,0.329,0.8876,0.2236,5.7692,0.4048,0.5683,1.0448,5.7513,3.6481,3.6407,0.2363,5.0708,3.571,2.3014,0.5317,4.5841,3.5912,3.9513,0.8656,5.0435,0.0028,0.0537,4.9783,1.4848,1.9121,3.5851,3.7183,3.9809,0.0001,0.6667,1.0055,4.266,0.2865,2.9424,1.578,2.5104,1.0143,0.8809,10.246,0.0982,3.0974,4.6012,5.3906,5.5583,1.5487,0.3863,2.239,5.8244,4.3344,3.0872,2.0575,1.0575,0.4165,8.3785,2.3348,0.8276,0.0058,2.5734,2.6571,0.5752,1.6793,5.5992,3.5156,0.2223,0.7637,2.5279,3.1485,0.5497,0.0617,0.001,1.9655,3.7877,4.2756,3.5661,2.6041,8.0622,0.349,4.9233,2.4713,0.0239,0.3654,4.5961,2.0588,5.4383,3.7341,6.0759,3.9804,1.9313,0.9557,1.4633,6.0493,1.3279,0.6627,2.0949,2.6206,1.2924,2.8931,0.0742,6.8528,0.5316,0.2803,0.9362,2.1802,4.6158,0.4292,5.4726,4.8538,1.5714,6.3869,2.0962,3.2394,1.7288,8.0222,5.3651,0.9127,0.0687,7.5849,0.0705,0.8903,0.9898,4.018,0.0219,0.6767,2.7006,1.3079,1.5662,0.2579,0.0032,6.8999,1.6211,3.0731,2.6774,1.1304,5.5321,0.6956,5.6172,4.0198,2.4465,0.5114,3.8918,0.0223,2.072,4.7565,1.2495,1.5189,1.1561,1.9744,0.5126,5.2154,0.0249,0.0015,1.9269,2.8273,4.32,0.5974,3.8577,4.7276,0.3543,1.2018,1.927,5.5293,0.0116,2.2505,0.2161,0.0031,4.5091,3.7141,0.1586,0.3836,3.6334,6.346,4.7263,5.63,3.65,5.8835,1.3162,3.9125,0.0372,1.0034,0.4221,4.3883,3.0027,0.0268,0.2063,1.8149,1.0439,1.3231,3.3896,2.8179,0.8544,0.0023,3.9623,0.7227,2.4743,10.4798,1.4172,0.7908,4.9976,3.6993,3.7207,1.5291,4.7895,4.3572,0.0032,1.3233,8.9581,0.0048,1.0911,0.4544,0.9219,3.4716,1.5679,5.1852,1.4152,1.8512,2.9313,5.4026,4.6571,7.2455,6.2913,5.8859,2.1333,1.9815,1.7418,1.7468,1.6533,4.461,0.6493,4.2889,1.4009,4.4245,3.2943,1.2112,0.7909,1.0609,0.9481,3.9284,3.7735,2.049,0.0127,0.0272,3.8468,3.2218,1.2077,6.2147,1.2585,7.6414,0.0123,0.8189,5.4432,1.9959,4.6396,4.2284,0.9953,0.0018,0.557,5.2882,0.1315,1.9721,2.2052,4.3963,1.6421,0.5154,5.722,5.7432,0.7909,2.1411,4.2967,0.6998,6.5884,2.1483,1.3295,5.0217,0.5453,0.0119,0.2781,1.0286,0.3002,0.6231,2.162,3.4421,2.0259,0.9883,4.5767,2.8916,4.0292,3.3682,9.7348,0.0082,0.7255,0.9219,0.4238,0.318,3.0214,2.838,1.6481,0.0028,1.0413,2.7631,0.6967,1.5455,2.5964,0.548,4.2128,0.4285,0.8877,4.9371,3.058,3.373,0.4483,2.2208,6.4449,0.0426,0.8022,2.8528,2.1385,0.0627,3.5604,5.5624,1.8692,2.7154,0.5932,0.3325,5.6804,0.4085,2.5842,1.4288,0.0082,0.0163,3.0973,0.9407,0.5014,0.1191,2.2573,1.2439,1.8765,8.0774,0.0166,0.0001,4.7301,2.8497,2.9769,0.0161,1.9274,5.0601,0.7411,3.5096,0.7084,6.2166,4.429,3.1263,0.2863,4.3721,0.7714,0.5659,0.8089,4.4346,5.6304,5.6027,3.6374,1.3009]}
{"prompt":"You woke up with no indication of who you are , or what you were doing .

All you see is a note in your hand that said, `` Memory erases every hour ; Save her '' Then, you wake up to hear the same voice again. It starts to make more and more sense when you go further.\n`` We can both erase your memories.\nWe can both take your life, but she lives in your mind, and you live in hers.''\nWhat does that mean? You remember everything now. What it means is that you're a part of her.\nYou never knew she exists in your head. She does now, because she was you.\nYou don't remember. No. All you do know is these things, which you never knew, that she loves you, which you never knew, and she always will, which you never knew, that you belong to her, which you don't remember, but always will remember, and that every hour you wake up, you have to save her.\nBecause the notes that you keep are her memories. And even the memories she erases are the ones you find.\nShe loves you, but you feel afraid.\nDo you remember being so afraid all along? And she helped you.\nYes. Every time I look at you, I see something new. Do you remember how long it took you to realise that?\nNo. I didn't even think about it back then.\nDid you ever think that you looked more beautiful?\nNever. Well, maybe today.\nAre you sure?\nYes. Is it even possible for someone to be so beautiful?\nWell...\nCan you tell me what I'm feeling right now?\nDid you touch the walls while I was asleep?\nNo. I didn't dare. You can still tell the world how beautiful I am.\nTell them I don't feel anything.\nTell them I don't remember anything.

This city was much larger than the one I was born. I went to the city one day. After the day was over, I went down to the sea together with some people. It was a dark and stormy day. The rain and the wind were so strong that we could not see far. We were in a boat. Some people had gone out of the boat before us. When they returned, they said that they had seen a shining light coming from the sky. They saw it go down into the water. I did not understand the words they were saying. I asked them what they meant by seeing the shining light. Some people said that it is like a bird with gold-colored wings. Others said that it is like a ship with a golden tower. Others said it is like a white pillar with flames going down from it.\"","token_len":582,"entropy":[10.6047,9.1047,0.5883,10.9654,4.9735,2.4235,11.5512,0.4317,0.0794,1.5353,9.4574,11.3998,1.1324,6.154,4.9761,5.6897,3.7818,8.6396,8.3273,4.0903,2.9598,3.6841,10.6819,3.569,6.3695,5.8277,4.0519,2.6812,4.2863,0.0303,0.8297,5.6981,0.9991,0.0618,0.5969,0.0229,0.0366,0.0029,0.0009,1.6138,0.1325,0.0499,0.1386,2.5268,5.8267,1.5015,0.0033,0.4482,0.2094,1.4256,8.8657,6.3098,1.3482,3.9035,0.4961,6.0697,4.0255,0.5886,1.9475,1.0053,5.1482,1.0677,3.4937,5.0372,1.1943,12.5993,8.0764,6.1279,1.9103,1.9233,2.6514,6.2637,8.5472,4.5578,5.1344,7.0813,2.0389,3.4531,3.7963,3.5875,1.2789,5.2391,1.9371,3.4668,3.9557,1.2343,1.8891,1.2143,0.2562,0.302,0.8218,6.5776,1.1287,1.1446,2.2083,6.2031,0.4125,4.053,5.6582,5.331,5.2069,4.6896,4.4046,0.8966,8.7574,0.7527,10.3059,2.1475,3.4489,3.527,5.5968,0.8854,3.1439,0.0014,4.4244,11.5549,5.5384,0.7426,0.7683,1.8442,1.0723,2.3257,3.7964,4.7241,4.6267,3.7818,2.1262,5.5236,5.3213,0.885,2.0228,2.6357,1.5619,5.92,1.743,4.6405,7.2455,3.1898,5.6966,0.0505,1.3506,2.6529,5.1123,2.5326,4.5156,2.0799,3.4693,2.736,5.4487,1.7641,0.939,6.0673,6.7029,1.6683,3.0652,3.7604,1.6128,1.3671,1.9686,1.6767,1.7946,2.2775,6.5206,1.8379,2.8008,3.4591,0.7578,2.2694,4.5486,4.0505,1.4432,3.4388,4.4087,4.0227,5.8126,2.9079,4.5857,1.5031,3.027,1.3114,5.2663,6.7499,2.0303,4.3256,5.3915,0.9501,0.7964,6.3054,6.6097,5.6808,6.3861,1.1658,0.4587,5.8742,4.2296,2.9804,5.3057,7.288,2.5514,0.5154,4.663,2.5372,1.0247,5.7392,1.9324,0.2312,0.7812,2.3808,2.0854,2.2644,0.2828,1.1715,2.0855,0.5867,2.929,2.0039,2.5666,1.9035,1.7275,0.2941,2.676,0.025,4.8936,3.5934,2.3235,0.6975,1.5901,2.7144,5.1942,0.7437,1.6884,6.8954,2.5814,0.4993,0.8497,2.4316,3.7853,4.5216,1.9922,3.3769,0.8177,7.5868,1.441,1.5419,3.2986,0.2775,0.9151,5.3333,0.6429,4.4246,3.3889,4.7233,8.0827,1.0653,0.9826,1.796,1.3999,0.4537,2.7575,5.5509,5.732,7.3159,0.4355,4.8823,5.1338,0.0683,4.7535,4.8376,0.1358,0.6019,2.3955,0.459,1.6415,1.0218,0.0428,1.1538,5.8704,1.2162,2.8216,1.5754,7.7892,7.3311,1.5193,1.0203,3.9174,2.9335,0.9035,0.4059,0.6563,0.1026,0.1174,2.6044,1.8806,1.9984,1.2623,2.5404,1.0658,0.4016,0.0917,0.0581,1.9033,3.5479,3.7848,1.0622,3.5589,2.4368,6.8764,5.6369,0.0392,2.424,3.9019,5.0078,3.5983,3.0914,2.8294,2.5068,0.2805,0.6875,1.0594,2.6608,9.3805,4.1927,0.6007,1.1278,3.4335,2.7614,3.2704,0.0944,1.5004,3.38,0.2507,3.4961,4.3047,5.2709,4.237,0.7805,5.2612,4.7129,2.6658,5.1402,2.1579,2.7864,1.3561,1.7324,1.9429,4.0226,2.9874,3.8146,0.4354,0.9808,4.077,0.8121,2.4375,1.7177,1.1886,0.7078,0.1181,0.2599,7.4824,0.4999,1.5287,3.3059,1.2661,2.9437,5.4708,5.0885,4.2759,0.8188,1.5015,0.0782,4.2413,0.1496,5.5546,2.913,5.1499,3.2446,2.1222,0.5081,1.1177,2.5911,1.4081,0.0996,0.0831,0.0422,0.3963,0.0177,0.1994,0.2019,0.0143,0.0129,0.0219,0.0142,0.0005,0.0098,0.0253,0.0275,0.001,0.0019,0.0041,0.0024,0.0017,0.0065,0.0009,0.0031,0.0007,0.0022,0.002,0.003,0.0155,0.0009,0.0025,0.0409,0.0017,0.0041,0.0027,0.032,0.0063,0.0022,0.0016,8.5155,0.016,0.0021,0.0228,6.699,2.8216,0.9396,1.4341,1.5611,6.6018,0.4948,2.9799,5.1934,2.8018,4.5268,2.1566,0.3756,0.3735,0.5403,1.0128,3.0348,0.8727,0.8711,1.4478,8.2453,0.0964,3.7647,2.7091,1.0214,3.7792,0.2582,1.3644,5.3691,2.3743,3.0536,0.0018,1.6827,0.4712,1.7917,4.0373,3.5815,1.1277,0.9663,1.5106,2.4459,1.548,0.391,2.6251,0.9386,0.6024,1.3317,4.8023,0.746,2.3403,1.525,2.9891,1.0719,2.6095,2.0434,4.9503,1.2741,2.8797,3.9964,2.0644,2.7113,0.7993,1.4983,5.4176,1.2509,0.7713,4.0069,2.2087,3.4682,0.7032,0.816,1.4598,3.5021,0.8714,1.0307,1.4338,1.4364,6.0531,2.5971,2.9295,0.4968,0.8463,2.6942,0.4697,1.9979,3.663,2.9259,5.1965,1.6273,2.3551,0.1063,3.6847,1.0416,2.2388,4.8663,0.0575,3.2195,3.2646,2.4459,3.4228,2.2643,0.2637,0.3616,1.2956,3.6796,0.9372,1.8732,0.9394,1.8383,1.3712,4.9918,1.2505,2.3478,0.074,0.3882,4.1327,2.1458,0.5002,0.7338,1.1147,4.4931,3.5763,1.0573,5.0393,4.3345,8.5298,3.3354,1.9534,0.6608,0.5908,2.3557,0.1213,0.1744,0.2353,0.3607,0.4036,0.3089,6.0125,1.0181,1.3313,3.4894,6.5987,0.8585,2.9125,0.1398,2.4066,0.3419,0.1901,0.2526,5.6946,6.8765,1.0909,7.119,5.9561,1.6697,1.5036,1.9408,3.235]}
{"prompt":"`` I told you to make a small fire . That is NOT a small fire ! ''","text":"`` I told you to make a small fire. That is NOT a small fire! ''\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d The fireman yelled. He rushed over. He looked at it. It wasn\u2019t a fire. It was a small fire. A tiny fire in the dark. The fireman\u2019s eyes widened again. He threw a bucket of water on it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to make a fire, are we? Not with wet leaves.\u201d My dad yelled. I yelled. Our cat yelled. He wanted a snack; it wanted to be comfortable.\nHe looked around the circle. It wasn\u2019t my best circle. My brother didn\u2019t do the circles very well. My sister had been too busy playing with her dolls. But now everyone had a circle on their finger. Everyone was supposed to do their fire with the circle. Everyone should be able to do it.\n\u201cYou,\u201d my dad said to me, \u201ctry and do your fire on the left, by yourself. I will do mine here. I don\u2019t want distractions.\u201d I didn\u2019t know why he picked me over my brother. But I\u2019m thankful that he did. All the rest did a fire, one at a time. I was at the end of the line.\nI waited. I didn\u2019t expect to be chosen as the one to get to do my fire. I had hoped that my sister or brother were going to do their fire. I was proud that they had chosen me. I waited in line, not really sure what was going to happen. At one point, I saw my sister\u2019s big circle next to my dad\u2019s small circle. I thought my big circle looked really small when I compared it to her\u2019s. Maybe my own will be smaller than my sister\u2019s one. My big circle wasn\u2019t as big as my dad\u2019s.\nI stood there looking up at the other firefighters. They were smiling. They were giving me good advice. They were laughing. And the fire wasn\u2019t starting.\nAt one point, I\u2019d heard some of my classmates mumble about the fire. \u201cCome on, dad,\u201d one girl had said. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Get on with it!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d my dad replied. He hadn\u2019t looked up from his circle. He was concentrating, working away. I felt very small. Like I needed to try my best, but I could not be trusted.\n\u201cLook how far they could get, and look how close we are,\u201d the fireman kept saying back.

This is not to worry, there is nothing to fear, the cards were just given to you while still in your mother's womb.

Each tarot card has a meaning that is relevant to the zodiac sign that it represents. When we see these cards, they usually form the arc of the zodiac sign they represent.\nThe tarot is an art or form of divination, but it has little to do with superstition. As much as you would look into the tarot to help you figure out your life, it is a tool that should be handled with care and respect.\nThere is little to find here that can not be found through common sense as well as other forms of divination. Like fortune telling, tarot reading, as much as it may seem like a lottery, if done right can provide you with an insight into what's going on in your life.\nIf you see the tarot cards, like many of us, many times, you will start getting familiar with the cards.

{"prompt":"For every day of the week , one of the Seven Sins takes a break .","text":"For every day of the week, one of the Seven Sins takes a break. Why the special day Monday of the Week has such a special day ( as do all the other days), i\u2019m not exactly sure, i\u2019m not going to find out this year. However, I can tell you that it all started with the idea just a few years ago that each day has a special meaning, an unexplainable and mysterious connection to others! I wasn\u2019t sure at first, i was just a bit excited about a new idea so i thought nothing of it, and the day after the day went by. But then, just a few weeks ago, I heard a phrase that I had no idea what it meant.\nA few weeks ago, there was an event in our church, probably the largest, most important community event we are doing. It was the one year anniversary of a group that has gone around giving us help, food, clothing etc for several years, they have gotten to know us well. This year the group decided to surprise us by going out to the residents in an unseen way. There were many stories in a little town called Gruver Hall. It is one story after another! I didn\u2019t know at first how this would affect me.\nIt came as a shock! I\u2019m used to going there to see my friends, to hang out. To sit and have a cup of coffee, or maybe not be able to do that at all. I had the opportunity to go to the Gruver Hall, I couldn\u2019t help but think about the people that make the community so special each day. But more than that, that there is always a special something inside everything that happens to someone that I don\u2019t know.\nWhen I went into the Gruver Hall, the first thing that I noticed was the beautiful view of a lake, that all the old town people are used to, but for some unknown reason, just for the special day on Monday of the week, that lake is much smaller, so it adds a special magic to the day, to the special place and that magical place. All around the town you can feel the power, the energy that comes from the people, the people that have been there a good long time even though new residents have moved in.\nAs I sat there, pondering on what it was that happened the day before and why it was, I had the opportunity to make a decision of what I wanted for tomorrow. This all happens through a natural and logical thought, we make a decision and then the miracle happens, the life of Christ comes to each of us, just as we need it on a certain point.\n\u201c If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d.","token_len":585,"entropy":[6.584,5.034,2.4987,1.4182,0.9171,0.6396,4.8553,1.6534,1.2403,9.3855,4.6709,4.7505,2.245,3.2786,1.6649,6.5413,5.0284,7.9473,2.7404,9.0669,5.8579,0.8609,3.4012,5.688,3.9164,0.6622,1.7251,3.8704,5.3945,11.4639,7.3149,2.3557,1.4978,1.5477,0.6048,3.1297,7.7128,13.4651,7.1142,3.2471,1.4847,5.5266,0.2646,2.3711,4.715,1.7305,0.0083,0.3283,1.3154,4.0574,0.0627,3.6469,0.2922,5.5309,3.7825,0.7028,3.7139,0.1241,2.2697,3.045,1.7309,0.2254,0.639,2.1228,5.8707,1.5411,1.4396,1.6114,6.0483,8.2014,1.6284,0.538,1.7937,0.1115,2.3812,6.5942,1.3696,4.5866,1.3665,0.1942,2.3153,2.0563,4.4996,9.1294,0.3358,0.0065,3.6497,3.3349,6.2794,1.0271,6.0912,7.4246,3.111,6.009,3.5087,0.5642,0.045,1.1053,5.0576,0.8532,1.2363,3.8843,2.8885,2.3201,2.808,3.7769,4.3136,1.3871,3.91,2.3362,3.4729,5.5471,1.1989,3.5442,6.4572,0.3555,0.11,1.5828,2.7415,4.2092,2.255,1.9492,2.3451,3.0872,5.5055,0.3384,2.3522,3.3936,1.7769,1.783,4.108,1.4514,0.3982,1.8804,0.5126,0.4149,2.062,3.2719,2.0692,6.3202,1.5686,2.6487,2.9407,3.7117,0.1913,2.2522,0.811,1.2419,1.081,3.5019,5.9692,2.9535,1.1438,0.2769,0.2863,4.261,0.3694,2.4031,3.0087,2.1657,4.549,4.4397,2.3351,7.8375,1.8679,3.3479,3.4301,1.859,1.8914,5.5408,4.9942,3.7691,4.1918,7.1096,2.0534,1.8233,0.4059,2.2896,4.8856,4.8364,0.0078,0.1609,3.3109,4.0301,2.4978,4.6657,4.0257,6.9071,5.4465,4.8762,5.5728,1.9578,5.9938,0.4176,2.4435,5.0529,4.2804,5.6139,0.3457,2.0883,4.6947,1.8987,5.0159,2.753,2.1971,1.0565,3.3029,1.8012,3.4811,2.5036,3.495,1.7173,3.7769,0.1746,9.1573,0.851,1.5908,3.1985,2.3247,1.4821,1.6487,10.1669,3.4911,4.7547,9.3951,0.9223,1.2466,4.0747,1.583,2.3297,4.2423,4.013,5.1125,4.6174,3.4132,1.2392,9.6628,4.44,8.4329,2.0875,2.5817,2.2006,3.3486,7.7295,5.1871,0.1162,5.2834,3.0934,4.1648,0.6979,0.0332,0.0097,0.7673,3.8598,0.4294,2.463,2.5448,1.9198,4.3308,2.0667,1.875,3.547,3.2723,4.5518,2.786,0.2991,1.3388,5.7524,1.344,4.2377,0.013,0.093,6.121,0.021,4.3275,3.9839,2.4216,1.6823,3.2614,1.2396,1.5627,2.9524,5.3683,0.0477,3.5724,4.7411,5.1416,2.365,3.2617,0.9172,4.6452,0.0144,0.7148,2.0283,2.8599,3.9556,5.0408,3.578,1.6673,0.002,3.0739,1.1816,2.5681,0.0198,0.8104,1.7187,2.6882,4.6288,4.293,0.2695,2.0978,1.259,1.5549,5.7245,0.0026,0.1272,2.3894,3.4611,4.2742,0.3636,0.0989,0.0008,4.2099,0.3453,1.4091,1.8754,2.0119,2.6646,1.6503,5.3777,2.7178,3.6931,2.4764,0.8658,7.6876,0.971,0.5212,3.8651,6.2347,0.8463,0.708,0.157,4.6081,6.1506,1.8732,4.1485,1.7626,1.6485,5.7593,4.073,6.6144,1.6146,4.1722,2.8798,5.4236,2.3582,3.2801,2.3015,0.1032,0.0478,0.2508,0.7117,1.9687,1.6331,4.1324,0.8759,2.8965,4.0314,0.3713,2.7649,0.0013,0.0343,0.6192,2.9397,2.8919,0.2502,1.0527,1.6973,1.052,0.2938,1.2967,5.1086,4.7552,1.1298,3.9832,2.6665,2.3508,3.0747,6.0654,1.0481,6.0347,4.8929,2.2486,3.4542,4.9252,0.0013,2.2123,2.2683,4.0543,1.3141,6.0913,0.0118,1.0154,4.8729,4.2599,1.3471,5.9463,2.1457,4.332,1.2308,0.9964,0.0806,0.8653,1.1928,3.1008,3.7219,1.8472,5.8448,3.2814,2.109,3.3945,1.8523,8.0849,1.3718,3.5683,7.1444,0.9145,0.7922,3.0187,2.6825,3.6399,1.6711,4.975,3.7764,3.3899,4.0157,5.6036,1.0555,1.7073,5.4752,4.3202,1.5138,3.7964,4.1231,1.3871,3.1094,0.6976,3.0924,3.7928,1.1427,3.5196,2.5339,3.0277,0.4811,0.9818,3.2491,1.6151,1.2548,2.5292,1.9349,3.0318,1.8312,1.8337,4.1938,6.8417,1.572,0.1616,7.8148,2.1406,8.1788,5.0712,2.5753,3.9682,0.5942,0.9451,1.4884,4.3184,1.1889,2.9051,0.7407,0.9123,6.0687,0.042,2.8274,1.9596,2.1275,1.5966,0.875,3.989,4.9574,1.4546,0.7421,3.9719,3.5256,1.2345,1.6609,4.648,0.8015,4.2922,2.0002,4.3751,0.0276,5.2457,1.1004,2.9586,5.0099,1.4025,1.5097,0.9803,4.4945,5.7174,0.5923,4.1057,6.7622,4.7277,5.8093,2.1486,6.007,3.7725,4.5543,5.8147,2.8309,6.0009,5.3493,2.6188,0.2363,2.8167,1.9692,2.6977,6.7355,0.5121,1.8248,2.0314,5.3764,2.3095,5.2923,3.2019,1.1834,6.8353,1.0575,0.0625,1.107,5.4234,1.8265,2.3538,6.4259,1.7391,5.6436,1.8731,3.4995,6.2069,1.6462,1.17,8.1162,5.8583,5.7245,2.3404,11.2386,1.9438,0.3211,1.0384,6.062,3.1887,5.2748,1.7596,3.7871,2.7647,3.7762,1.1503,0.4995,3.0092,0.0783,2.2794,8.2248,0.024,0.4462,1.0079,2.1976,5.4716,0.4148,0.02,4.895,8.7034,5.0021]}
{"prompt":"God has been trying to kill off the human race for thousands of years . It is only by the effort of Lucifer that humanity has survived .","text":"God has been trying to kill off the human race for thousands of years. It is only by the effort of Lucifer that humanity has survived. His plan is slowly coming to fruition through the corrupt influence of our leaders and the world that surrounds us. The only way one can stand up to this evil plan is to be a man of faith and by the power of God's grace and unconditional love be rescued from the grip of Satan on the one hand and the corrupt nature of humanity on the other. Only this way can we survive.\nThis book is a personal account of how Jesus walked in my life and the trials that I lived through just to try and get to know him and realize that if I trust in him with all of my heart even though nobody ever really liked me or wanted to talk to me and it was painful and confusing to live like that. Through trying to be like Jesus in as much as possible everyday, things that was happening around me started to change and God changed me from an ugly, cruel, mean, sad child to a strong, determined, kind and caring person. Through being like Jesus I found out that forgiveness was very important to God and that if I had hurt somebody and were trying to make up for it even though I was trying to love and be a good person, God still couldn\u2019t accept it out of respect for His Holy name and authority. Jesus could forgive me if I forgave my brother or sister or mother or father or even God himself for any sin or mistake that they had made against me. I learned from Jesus about trusting God and his perfect righteousness even if people around me were telling me to do something completely different.\nI have grown so much along the way and there\u2019s never been any doubt that God loves me and I\u2019m never going to hate or be cruel or mean to anyone ever again. This book is about those who have gone through similar things but it isn\u2019t all about me...I\u2019m just the example and the proof. There are some very important things that you can learn to grow beyond this. For example, not giving your own power or self-worth away and still having courage and faith when it seems like no one else has but you do. I also learned how important it is to give thanks for every good thing you have in your life. You can be a better person and do better in your life if you are grateful to God for all that He has done for you and the people that He put in your life.\nI still live out my Christian faith everyday but not blindly in the way I used to. I don\u2019t have to fight or shout and make people afraid of me anymore. I just love God with all of my heart and just know that he sees me with the love and grace that is so much larger and greater than what I could ever do for Him.","token_len":585,"entropy":[5.0824,2.6417,6.8405,0.2508,3.6571,6.5604,1.4796,4.9385,0.3925,0.7099,2.5001,0.0305,0.0297,0.9851,2.9285,1.3956,3.8883,4.1016,3.0128,5.4027,0.3649,7.1893,0.9594,2.4185,2.0897,3.2591,1.0642,4.0926,2.4373,0.733,8.2532,2.9285,0.0604,1.4036,5.7128,1.0145,6.7956,4.5312,0.0397,5.2149,4.4472,1.5837,1.802,5.8392,4.3363,4.1368,0.7892,0.2462,2.6598,2.9624,0.8611,7.52,0.2913,5.3077,1.9355,0.9665,2.2156,2.136,3.3877,0.2418,0.5704,3.3449,2.1379,3.8919,1.2509,2.526,1.2848,5.7569,3.6624,1.7551,0.078,1.5255,3.6497,2.1963,2.5326,7.0816,0.1382,6.6807,8.3896,0.7992,1.434,4.117,0.0218,1.5555,6.8501,2.3328,4.6981,0.1824,0.424,1.6892,5.0498,5.2732,0.0994,3.352,0.365,0.0017,0.0009,0.2504,5.7098,4.2752,3.1163,0.5136,1.2291,3.4837,1.1974,1.257,7.2596,2.0019,0.7326,1.7282,4.8555,5.1254,0.2628,2.8,4.076,6.0514,3.3091,4.982,0.7064,1.1509,3.1456,5.4776,1.5549,1.7353,6.1969,0.7182,7.5268,1.929,4.404,0.7588,3.1136,1.8551,2.0564,0.7566,1.9996,6.1754,1.3982,5.1397,0.578,7.8378,1.9095,1.3926,5.2799,0.8584,1.6978,0.2848,1.0396,7.7544,2.3194,9.4624,3.2331,3.467,6.2035,0.3449,2.1415,2.8256,0.5281,4.0826,0.2612,0.0096,3.134,3.972,1.1929,6.0189,2.1646,3.8874,1.6684,3.6739,4.881,1.0094,2.6518,5.9303,7.068,0.2734,3.1734,2.997,1.4216,3.4688,8.4559,1.0696,0.2657,0.5035,9.5557,1.5414,8.2465,3.3975,6.4164,5.2435,3.5552,0.0573,4.6565,0.3413,1.3669,1.1943,5.6413,3.8043,1.407,4.2064,2.8886,4.8065,1.718,5.5665,0.8781,4.1073,1.0222,4.3835,5.6225,0.7518,0.6106,3.9741,0.5294,4.827,0.7245,4.634,1.9925,2.4381,1.3113,0.5481,4.4753,4.1327,3.2534,0.3817,1.5635,3.3046,2.8958,0.6485,6.6993,1.7173,5.9782,1.054,1.113,4.6981,0.8389,1.2055,3.0189,0.6546,3.4431,7.772,3.8045,3.179,5.736,3.7276,0.0434,3.279,4.5938,0.1145,0.3357,6.3834,0.6489,0.5728,1.5796,3.2289,0.1783,5.2666,2.0823,2.0387,2.7855,0.6858,0.2606,1.3862,2.4878,6.2811,5.1663,15.9562,8.2706,0.3006,5.3754,1.2504,7.3484,0.0246,6.093,0.7313,8.7635,6.7953,5.775,1.3886,7.6234,0.597,4.5632,5.6311,3.448,0.959,2.3836,0.4087,8.0654,0.0842,3.2503,4.705,2.5934,1.307,1.3103,4.138,0.8123,1.5168,0.7964,3.3828,3.5187,2.4866,2.6468,3.5078,2.1811,2.5015,4.6309,1.412,3.9584,1.8635,1.2478,4.7017,1.0343,0.6799,1.7655,3.0587,2.7024,1.9119,3.3506,5.7331,2.5652,1.2048,4.4055,5.9569,4.8652,5.1825,2.6133,5.5368,5.587,0.027,1.4501,5.1614,0.2737,2.2536,1.9929,3.0227,5.6036,0.451,1.0986,1.8788,1.6195,2.8047,5.8063,2.8777,1.1156,6.0811,2.0195,0.1097,1.8447,5.08,10.7329,0.6987,0.9193,3.9977,1.0902,1.3794,3.3021,0.8455,2.5906,2.7371,0.5025,1.359,1.8688,6.0858,0.071,0.4896,5.1918,1.1242,0.0983,6.0874,2.1894,2.8617,5.9609,1.2999,2.5857,1.4862,0.729,5.0316,0.1452,0.2442,3.4625,0.474,0.7491,3.0379,5.5587,1.1213,2.0644,4.305,0.1546,4.9088,1.8767,3.3511,3.6619,4.341,1.7621,0.482,0.0111,3.432,0.5916,2.108,7.3385,3.2075,2.5025,0.2621,0.0478,2.5692,4.2354,7.395,3.5193,1.7375,4.8809,2.1331,3.9904,0.9337,3.6293,4.0314,3.3275,1.088,0.8805,3.3045,0.9109,1.7173,4.4838,5.9038,6.9275,3.189,2.7423,3.3186,0.6916,0.4653,5.3605,4.7138,3.6278,3.7441,6.6939,2.7115,5.2565,1.5075,2.0462,2.9824,2.6437,6.3747,3.6506,7.2441,1.4582,3.4338,4.0043,1.7767,5.9845,0.5153,4.3602,0.0883,3.6086,2.3427,5.8181,0.5298,4.0113,0.8666,2.5776,4.778,1.1986,2.839,3.5448,0.666,0.1468,0.3671,4.3048,5.6782,1.3496,5.0294,3.7844,1.2495,1.0914,1.3241,4.1875,1.896,0.1018,1.5002,3.4043,1.4133,2.9216,1.9911,3.6476,0.2982,2.1018,4.0396,1.7106,2.7295,1.9624,0.8061,1.6169,0.0841,2.9574,4.0759,1.7253,0.2124,1.0741,2.2009,1.7805,3.4298,0.3098,1.3216,0.2483,0.0315,1.8029,3.7704,3.0844,2.9974,2.9304,7.4928,0.8728,1.5376,0.6281,0.6365,1.8426,1.6731,5.6305,4.2187,5.2703,1.2788,4.1905,0.745,4.5415,3.0,5.0079,8.2971,4.3394,1.6419,1.385,0.9243,1.6084,0.0022,0.9265,0.7731,3.2043,0.4797,0.0926,0.0042,3.1067,1.3617,5.5327,3.2078,7.156,2.9168,4.4534,3.6172,5.0677,1.8829,0.4126,3.2676,0.7227,0.5959,2.7733,4.2945,2.1964,3.4435,0.3567,1.4285,0.0469,0.02,0.4849,4.193,4.0708,0.2348,2.6346,6.2106,1.3668,3.8369,2.4532,2.6626,1.3004,3.9392,1.1642,3.2284,2.5276,2.7272,5.0601,3.1903,3.8675,0.1623,1.8118,0.4535,3.4735,0.5685,5.8411,2.0673,3.802,0.4572]}
{"prompt":"You are born with the ability to stop time , but one day you see something else is moving when you have already stopped time .","text":"You are born with the ability to stop time, but one day you see something else is moving when you have already stopped time. When you are older, you find the one who did that, you kill her and save the world. It is the game you played in your bedroom. \"\nMara was stunned. She couldn't imagine the person who did such a thing. He would have saved himself.\nThat night, he was sleeping by herself. No one came to knock on her door. The next day, she was still missing until one day, she found her boyfriend on the bench next to the window. The boy looked scared.\nMara was frightened for herself, but she stayed silent as much as possible. When he was about to leave the room again, she stood up and asked:\nHe took her hand and welled her to the room. She asked what he was in such a hurry for, but he wouldn't tell her.\nThe next days her heart pounded so much that she couldn't hold down her head. She went to her boyfriend and asked if he had something that she didn't know. She wanted to hear to her parents about it. She didn't want to keep this secret from her parents for too long. Finally she told her boyfriend and they decided to be honest to each other.\nAfter a few days she met a boy who she liked. He was a year ago old than herself. She talked to him over the phone and met him at a park one afternoon. He was scared of meeting with her parents. When they first met, it was a little awkward. He was so scared but he told her everything. Her father wasn't okay with his choice of a partner. He came up with the perfect excuse of him being in military service overseas. His father didn't want to get into the bad name. His parents said that they should marry as soon as possible.\nIt soon turned out that they both had good stuff. They planned a wedding with full entertainment. Her family was so proud and happy.\nThey were a very happy couple. The couple continued to see each other as much as possible. They even came often to his house. Eventually things started to take a turn. In a few months, he became distant. They kept talking but not much more. Eventually it was over. She got a job in the local office and they rarely met.\nOne day she did not see him for two months. Two days later he told her that he just needed some time to get things organized for the wedding. That was when she realised that he could be the reason why. She tried to stop everything to understand it. He ended up telling her that his father is in a bad health and they didn't need anyone to help her. She was furious when she found out, but the best she could do was cry as much as possible.","token_len":585,"entropy":[3.8828,7.813,1.9056,1.9169,1.7933,0.0789,6.7177,4.3075,1.7252,2.2033,6.1385,1.6646,0.8528,5.4301,2.8274,3.5178,6.4629,4.9417,7.1937,0.2828,4.044,5.3494,1.4147,1.1921,0.6425,3.7284,0.4541,2.3342,4.626,0.543,0.6482,5.4163,3.4201,5.9393,3.4238,4.223,2.3003,2.8712,3.2207,7.2612,4.6368,1.9622,5.2681,2.145,1.1225,0.6385,3.1458,0.9893,2.4386,6.9088,2.2245,3.2257,2.8195,3.0147,7.5805,1.4502,5.2663,1.7729,10.2941,4.3677,4.1517,8.5191,1.4933,1.9659,3.5902,0.0009,4.2097,2.4638,5.9887,1.1965,3.219,5.1096,0.3178,1.475,0.6968,4.1786,3.5222,1.4879,5.6712,6.8591,1.9608,1.6949,5.064,3.1284,0.4435,2.1734,2.4235,4.3797,4.2808,1.7808,1.2356,5.0639,0.8303,4.2081,0.7848,8.7787,0.7997,1.4987,0.0939,0.4983,2.8679,3.8332,1.0167,0.2559,1.2748,2.2448,4.129,6.1772,6.6175,4.2473,1.2134,1.4446,1.3728,2.4691,1.5586,5.0453,4.4159,0.5203,6.7943,3.0429,0.1089,2.661,3.2565,0.6274,2.7249,4.4118,3.6193,4.3851,1.0989,1.6072,1.9491,0.0206,2.5438,4.8306,3.0019,5.3812,1.9401,1.4856,0.9803,5.468,2.5377,3.8248,4.8803,0.1207,0.9701,0.2459,3.2822,2.2276,2.711,2.9571,0.717,2.0533,2.6355,1.1411,6.4267,0.1001,0.7328,4.9995,0.5561,0.6229,3.4891,4.0826,1.8517,4.9383,5.9277,1.5748,1.9653,0.923,11.3762,1.6494,1.496,4.2059,0.8829,5.9403,0.6522,2.1093,3.8244,3.1509,1.4287,0.7808,6.8482,7.2285,0.2457,0.2532,2.6619,1.6837,1.221,0.5796,4.7819,0.0011,2.3878,0.2753,0.7135,1.2964,2.9227,1.8528,7.6388,6.2989,4.6268,4.9595,3.5456,1.3462,0.6442,0.5101,2.0114,0.0002,4.7866,5.6538,1.2817,3.4387,0.6023,1.1621,3.7158,0.4704,2.3918,2.837,2.0357,1.7859,2.4039,0.4024,2.4988,3.8679,3.5666,1.3602,3.9708,0.0004,1.058,0.8262,2.6122,4.6791,0.3787,4.8309,6.2374,2.5513,5.0887,2.5497,0.8339,0.5456,2.0983,2.8891,0.0007,1.3806,0.3427,5.6064,5.0793,1.5971,1.727,1.943,1.346,4.3664,2.5433,0.0154,0.2172,6.0552,1.7069,2.4925,1.5575,1.4196,2.8941,2.6314,4.6818,0.327,5.5046,4.0059,4.5261,0.2161,0.0122,0.3918,0.6468,3.5354,2.2787,1.2936,0.7001,3.2054,4.5505,1.8701,3.5402,1.4968,3.8474,4.0339,1.2419,0.9097,0.9416,1.6407,6.4207,7.9405,7.264,9.8577,7.9164,0.5969,2.0225,5.5257,0.6104,0.0479,5.3859,1.3416,0.1006,1.0043,5.9361,0.7142,1.6407,1.7234,2.9725,5.7258,2.9184,0.1874,1.215,0.8966,6.0196,2.3151,5.8892,6.1701,0.9419,2.9481,0.772,3.6045,2.2106,4.6278,0.7149,0.4072,4.1101,0.3888,2.9442,3.3076,1.8948,0.998,1.8612,1.1621,3.4625,2.7947,5.6767,2.029,3.5152,0.2196,3.4409,0.8218,5.0297,2.4546,5.713,0.0011,6.5595,0.8765,3.8522,6.6958,1.1867,3.6283,4.6833,0.758,1.6962,5.2695,3.0915,0.6881,1.1734,4.878,4.1989,4.8454,4.011,1.8782,3.1358,9.4848,1.5734,6.9944,0.6844,4.241,2.2135,2.8533,0.0005,1.2602,0.5707,4.0687,1.8852,1.9362,6.0402,6.7065,2.1998,3.8645,2.5185,3.7832,1.7068,1.8271,5.0275,6.0822,6.0754,0.6423,0.0024,0.4488,0.7069,1.0701,4.0759,7.0897,3.2126,0.2001,0.1538,2.7,3.7264,1.7061,3.5611,8.0113,1.7862,1.5542,5.5321,2.5859,1.2593,4.0717,9.2268,9.5338,1.2517,4.7475,3.9892,1.7506,3.5163,3.0127,2.8272,1.672,1.5687,1.9517,3.0379,2.5375,4.731,3.101,1.4111,0.2921,0.3665,2.7954,3.7539,6.5886,0.5677,4.419,0.1248,0.0097,3.8286,3.596,0.0178,0.9989,0.4289,1.6722,4.2436,5.2331,8.0412,0.7528,5.4508,0.9828,1.0865,5.672,5.7494,2.0764,0.4949,5.0096,0.5125,0.2436,2.7328,4.4787,3.2371,1.2357,1.4649,0.4331,2.0736,3.5381,7.1404,2.0013,3.2338,4.4409,2.0212,4.2286,3.7674,2.6636,2.7206,0.2261,3.0061,3.8414,1.6539,2.3322,0.3582,3.1101,3.6828,2.2541,1.0257,2.5475,1.5897,3.4306,4.9094,1.4906,3.2127,10.4668,3.063,0.751,1.2965,4.7238,0.289,2.3744,5.7519,3.0749,3.8085,0.7289,2.7359,2.9549,1.4013,0.3709,5.6215,1.911,0.385,1.901,3.7866,0.0303,1.2199,0.4987,5.6524,4.2972,2.9504,0.6382,0.8285,2.2589,4.709,4.9469,3.2507,1.9026,2.2322,0.2349,4.1945,1.8167,1.4066,0.7715,5.4425,0.7553,1.1145,4.3571,2.3513,3.5961,4.1827,1.0543,2.1443,1.7419,4.4074,0.2315,3.7485,4.6275,4.85,6.1782,3.4242,0.7943,2.0041,7.0372,0.103,2.9797,0.0585,1.0736,3.3833,2.3851,3.2883,3.4917,1.9827,2.3237,5.9909,0.9701,4.2568,4.067,0.0006,3.387,4.7413,0.757,0.8999,5.188,0.6944,1.7908,2.4778,3.5962,4.4986,1.3851,2.4386,0.058,3.9244,0.8919,3.8848,5.0676,2.4077,0.1222,0.1582,0.1539,5.2958,5.1309,1.2116,0.0559,1.5703,0.2445]}
{"prompt":"Beyond a window in Venice","text":"Beyond a window in Venice is a work of fiction set in Venice, although it doesn\u2019t need to be read for one to understand that much of the writing about Venice or about Venice in literature is made in the first person (in the form of a diary). The fact that this text is set in Venice creates the first image of Venice in the reader\u2019s mind, whether it be one of Venice as an architectural composition or Venice as a cultural construction made by authors during their journeys or visits to Venice.\nThe book is a great mix of essays and stories that tell the story of Venice from different viewpoints. The essays describe places and descriptions of the places that are central in the book, they describe how the descriptions are made, and how Venice is perceived and described by authors and readers. Essential essays include: The Dove and the Falcon: An Encounter with Venice by Antonio Tabucchi, On Venice by G.B. Shaw, The Flautist of Venice by J\u00f8rn Rieland, The Ruin by John Berger, I Want to Be a Pirate: And How to Get It by James Michener, The Black Dog Trilogy by Tom McCarthy, and The Venice Diaries by Jack London. These essays are not simply descriptions of Venice, but reflections of Venice in literature through the writings of authors in their essays, and in their writings on Venice. The essays that relate the book\u2019s title to the book are a mix of biographies of the books: the book was a response to the book about a lost Venice written by the editor of Il Gazzettino in Venice in a series of essays entitled Beyond Our Gates. The essays in the book relate to different places and different aspects of the Venetian experience at different times: the relationship of Venice and Venice, the relationship of Venice and tourism, the relationship of Venice and Venice in literature, the relationship of Venice and Venice through the relationship of different times, and the place of Venice in literature.\nThe first part of the book is a collection of essays that focus on writers who have written about Venice. The three sections in the first part of the book are composed of six essays: one essay contains two titles, and four essays are titled individually.\nThe central themes of the essays in the first part are the relationship between Venice and Venice in the essays titled Venice \/ Venice and Venice \/ Venice, the relationship of Venice and Venice through the relationship between different times in the essays titled Beyond Our Gates: The Diary of Venice and The Black Dog Trilogy by Tom McCarthy, and the relationship of Venice and authors in the essays titled On London and The Flautist of Venice. Each essay is rich in details and is a clear reflection on Venice and Venice and all the elements that constitute the Venice experience.

{"prompt":"The people and other things you killed in video games turned out to be real , you are being held accountable for your warcrimes in the supreme court .","text":"The people and other things you killed in video games turned out to be real, you are being held accountable for your warcrimes in the supreme court. You owe yourself an apology\nThey don't have a God or a Supreme Being and their laws are not set by an almighty God. They are based on their culture and their ideas, not their religion and there is no compelling reason to worship a non existent God.\nYou don't have to worship people, only think to follow them and in this case it's clearly the bible. In these books you find many examples of being a coward, not having a moral conscience and the general population was always against the Romans to do their dirty work and most of the time they were defeated.\nThe Romans had a problem with the population when they started to dominate them. There were many wars, revolutions, revolutions, wars. But the Romans were always able to carry out their dirty work because they had control over the population. That's why it's in the bible always.\nNow, the population in this case isn't always bad; it's just some bad things. In the early stages, the population was used more often in battle than in other war tactics, while later on the population always dominated the Roman population. When I'm talking, I mean the majority of the population. Only a small majority would be willing to obey when there is a law that goes against their moral conscience. It's all about power.\nThere are some people who, when they go to war, kill both people who are willing to fight and people who are not. They are cowards who, when there are no other ways of fighting, try to fight, but at the end of the war they are dead, no matter what happens. They say that they are soldiers, but they are just cowards who deserve to die.\nIn general, the Romans were a very strong people, well, their leaders, because a lot of people did not want to defend themselves from the Romans. And the Romans were always able to win. In the case of a war, they don't have to defend themselves; the war is not for them. They just have to give up their belongings and their families to conquer other peoples. That's also true for us today: some people don't want to defend themselves and don't want to know it, but they always have to follow their leaders and obey their commanders; just as the Romans did.\nIn this war, a lot of people were killed, but the war was not fought by the Romans against the Gauls; this isn't like a regular war between enemies. It's not about killing people and having a war of revenge, but it is just a war of control. The Romans, on the one hand, took over everything and the power, and on the other hand, they killed a lot of people.","token_len":586,"entropy":[6.1859,4.5117,6.3165,4.1743,3.8436,9.2585,2.8142,8.4658,0.1931,8.5236,0.5648,0.1345,0.0765,3.0247,2.421,3.6182,3.9705,4.7282,2.4717,0.6442,0.9191,2.2957,8.4525,9.6176,0.0036,4.3747,1.6824,11.1804,0.3563,1.3205,2.6593,5.4571,7.0608,4.0558,0.0784,7.3995,14.6295,3.9356,0.0011,2.1831,2.1064,7.8631,2.8059,1.3498,4.8513,2.7384,3.2018,4.0712,5.5568,0.7922,2.5641,5.9445,1.7095,4.7498,6.297,0.4006,0.0001,1.0954,0.7576,1.6674,1.4404,3.7229,0.196,3.8835,5.8054,0.9851,1.9984,3.8886,2.4342,1.8216,3.2701,3.4605,2.99,6.247,0.6176,0.4957,9.4021,0.7878,0.8651,5.7903,2.108,5.118,6.0741,0.0185,1.3639,0.6255,1.3038,2.7359,3.5576,0.0009,1.3603,0.7581,4.5894,5.3287,3.2238,4.4379,6.7731,4.661,7.1399,2.6554,2.2522,6.2892,2.9419,1.0774,3.4526,1.9686,7.0963,3.3847,7.7426,0.9548,4.7919,5.4643,6.7203,1.2286,4.865,3.982,2.6167,0.2623,5.4073,3.2974,4.8044,1.1831,4.0374,4.1447,1.4866,3.4409,3.3508,1.3886,4.2506,6.3176,5.7815,5.125,5.0663,4.1447,2.5635,6.6945,5.442,3.9977,4.7191,2.5731,0.0476,2.265,5.501,0.715,1.0069,1.6524,1.7943,1.6108,5.3506,0.9132,1.02,2.4963,4.1646,3.1201,1.495,4.9943,0.6305,2.1163,6.7547,5.3381,0.3417,3.2387,1.9302,6.4248,4.121,1.3695,4.0645,1.0863,2.2418,4.0997,2.1478,7.079,0.974,2.9601,1.7429,2.1277,2.2794,3.5168,1.9185,1.3955,1.6408,3.8535,3.89,0.0088,5.6255,0.7143,0.9829,3.9885,0.1985,3.2893,0.6063,1.5044,4.9609,0.6345,0.8261,2.0701,0.8366,4.1018,0.8983,0.8763,3.0533,0.874,5.6972,0.8773,0.9131,10.0287,4.2017,0.8601,4.1858,1.9133,2.343,5.9212,3.7169,2.1958,2.8328,4.951,0.0004,4.8609,4.8308,5.2827,1.4163,0.5989,2.3055,6.062,4.0716,3.9344,2.0871,3.497,1.5412,4.5213,4.3034,2.5771,1.4725,1.8846,0.7922,5.6568,5.5587,4.1358,3.3991,5.0334,2.0418,1.4888,3.5008,4.1727,8.1711,2.0497,6.6471,5.1783,1.4222,1.6213,0.4342,7.3526,6.2093,1.5635,5.7515,2.8838,0.5711,4.4377,4.0854,3.4409,2.4581,6.8867,1.7195,1.8778,2.183,5.6185,0.2219,1.1992,0.6067,2.8973,6.8558,1.5161,1.3523,5.0508,5.0687,1.8263,3.5033,0.0189,4.7329,6.5007,3.6497,1.7848,0.9016,7.0147,2.2926,5.748,0.2925,1.4339,4.8387,1.8984,0.5308,3.3808,0.6281,4.2747,1.9007,4.3805,0.9263,0.7157,3.8413,0.9618,2.7971,1.529,0.5552,5.1658,2.4421,0.7353,3.6911,0.8759,0.3988,0.3967,4.2299,8.3462,3.5754,3.3814,1.1435,4.9843,0.1199,2.2798,0.9699,2.2545,0.1668,0.6435,0.9008,0.697,2.4379,1.6162,8.8684,0.0007,2.7327,4.8267,0.8807,3.8815,1.6182,2.0773,2.28,3.2011,2.1303,1.5743,0.3875,5.0192,0.2117,5.0636,3.7612,2.1522,4.6912,0.5132,1.199,0.466,0.0279,5.6076,0.9074,1.9344,3.5962,2.7384,4.7433,2.3837,0.8262,3.1181,0.5899,2.3961,5.3053,1.8886,1.8845,1.2763,5.8229,1.4879,0.7816,1.5785,0.6334,3.8805,1.9732,0.0011,1.677,8.1933,0.7356,0.2009,0.8303,0.8922,3.2633,5.2714,0.4604,1.8532,2.0192,1.2624,2.6833,2.4185,3.5107,2.4033,1.6489,6.1052,2.9105,4.8734,3.7815,3.1023,4.5258,5.835,0.5561,0.02,2.1494,4.2369,0.3736,2.1479,0.4008,6.5452,1.6371,2.7841,1.1948,0.7862,0.7498,3.8594,2.5785,1.074,1.2728,3.7122,1.3436,0.0033,4.8627,2.2742,3.4829,1.5399,4.0817,0.0344,3.4845,1.7659,0.7088,1.5859,5.2448,0.0006,1.3706,1.0724,3.5757,0.4155,3.7347,3.6215,3.567,1.0071,3.064,3.7008,0.9681,0.6658,1.5401,1.8556,1.538,0.2626,4.8584,1.0943,1.6878,8.7295,0.9266,2.759,4.6001,2.5375,5.9087,4.4264,1.8644,0.6474,3.0704,0.3209,6.1633,2.0495,2.0003,4.5676,3.7949,4.4506,5.4859,0.8514,2.9343,0.0004,1.1071,0.1247,2.9584,0.2702,2.8544,4.2896,0.0002,0.752,0.1677,5.2827,5.1448,1.8336,0.8439,1.381,4.8107,1.4017,1.5093,5.2353,1.7517,3.1848,1.192,2.7182,0.5562,4.8344,6.0643,5.4858,2.3424,2.094,0.6207,0.8731,0.965,0.3302,3.0094,2.9146,2.4016,0.5058,4.3499,0.6142,0.0389,0.6496,2.0226,1.1781,1.5446,2.0093,1.9583,3.8244,1.1343,1.4393,4.0865,2.1672,1.6742,0.7588,5.0675,0.8582,4.789,0.0106,3.0471,4.3853,6.0073,0.0003,4.1414,2.0191,6.5563,0.325,3.6017,7.0184,1.026,1.7411,1.1152,2.349,3.52,3.3094,1.5797,2.9997,5.4216,1.3897,1.7504,3.4834,4.006,2.1912,1.5249,2.1232,1.5569,5.6005,1.354,0.3892,1.1714,5.7105,0.9511,2.4868,0.4354,4.2115,3.4151,0.0905,3.0446,0.0076,0.0594,4.5646,1.8579,5.0971,1.4202,2.858,5.1485,2.732,2.0374,2.109,0.0037,0.0035,0.1528,0.3907,0.7023,4.8559,2.7244,0.172,0.0664,0.3168,1.162]}
{"prompt":"NASA finds a Voyager-type space probe from an Alien civilization approaching Pluto","text":"NASA finds a Voyager-type space probe from an Alien civilization approaching Pluto -\nThe NASA Pluto Science Team has discovered a spacecraft in the Pluto system near its south pole. The spacecraft's location is almost 90,000 miles outside of the Pluto orbit, but still within the Pluto's 1.25 Astronomical Units (AU) Pluto's fly-by boundary. The probe, most likely representing a Voyager type probe, could be from an alien civilization and possibly a human probe.\n\"For us here at NASA, being able to find a spacecraft and identify if and when it passed by Pluto is of the utmost importance,\" says Ralph Martin, the director of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office. \"It's very rare to find a spacecraft of other size (but not mass), and more importantly, we are still able to use the data to study the surface of Pluto.\"\nThe discovery was made with NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). In 1998, ACE was launched by NASA's Aqua spacecraft to explore Pluto-like bodies. The spacecraft has a long range of about 4,600 miles, and a range of about 1,000 miles when it can use solar power to recharge its batteries. ACE made the first complete scan over an area just below Pluto's south polar cap.\nThe detection of the probe near the spacecraft would be impossible if any spacecraft were close to Pluto, but could not be seen by the spacecraft's cameras.\n\"This discovery would seem to suggest that a spacecraft of some type passed by Pluto's south pole about a year ago, and that it would have passed by Earth somewhere during the same period,\" says Martin. \"However, if the probe was a simple ship, with no technology at all, we would have detected it, and if the probe were a fully advanced vessel we might have been tracking it all the time.\"\nThe discovery, the first by the NASA mission, will hopefully shed lights on the science of the Pluto-Halo system. The system is an interesting one, due to its similarities with the Kuiper belt of outer space. Many different things have been suggested to be in the system, including asteroids, comets, rocks and ice, and possibly other objects in orbit.\n\"This is a unique system that has not been studied very well,\" says John Hartmann, lead scientist on the Science Analysis Team. \"With our new image, we can use it to improve our understanding of the Pluto-Halo system. In particular, we'll be able to refine our understanding of the size and composition of the Pluto-Halo system.\"\nThe team at the NASA Pluto Science Team will use the image to search for other spacecraft in the system. Because Pluto has been around for some time, the team expects that future missions - such as the New Frontiers mission - will find other spacecraft in the system, similar to that found by the ACE spacecraft.","token_len":587,"entropy":[9.6181,2.5237,11.1512,1.7738,3.2762,5.2742,1.1712,5.1413,4.3879,9.4731,6.8287,7.9068,5.5066,5.9168,5.5435,8.32,5.0611,9.4823,4.6782,2.2675,1.9125,2.0827,0.6287,3.3668,4.0898,1.2574,3.2415,0.4193,5.4948,2.7975,5.938,0.096,1.2682,1.5673,1.4045,4.0334,3.881,1.0749,6.0797,6.3517,2.877,0.0359,0.9682,5.6497,0.9563,1.3288,2.9528,5.8142,1.4882,2.6861,5.3315,2.0732,0.7876,2.6631,3.9891,7.4484,0.6273,4.2863,8.7178,0.0262,0.6084,0.9851,0.0359,0.4884,6.684,3.2195,7.8788,3.3704,0.0888,7.3115,3.0331,1.364,2.4137,2.6513,9.4773,0.8574,8.2784,1.0002,3.9775,5.326,2.1636,0.397,4.9358,1.1535,4.4717,1.7547,1.1015,0.2106,4.1501,4.0515,1.9413,3.7949,5.2482,0.6751,1.4651,3.0393,5.4569,2.2786,5.6115,1.2627,0.243,0.2851,5.8869,2.1134,0.0023,2.4846,1.6496,1.2247,4.1902,5.3695,6.494,6.1944,0.3955,0.8284,6.0406,1.8973,0.9245,0.7743,5.7792,3.0776,0.7636,0.1157,0.5283,2.1098,6.0142,6.2879,0.1282,2.5668,3.4291,0.0548,1.4642,0.0304,3.2968,0.2747,0.1142,0.139,0.3215,5.3222,0.7191,0.5499,2.227,0.9708,3.3269,2.8426,1.4235,0.3511,1.0251,0.4217,3.8632,7.343,5.4304,5.2248,4.9908,1.9871,6.7018,3.6067,1.3921,6.0632,2.6283,0.5351,2.6152,2.787,4.1386,3.339,0.0061,3.7357,1.7934,3.3712,1.0837,4.0469,1.1252,3.5675,0.7266,1.3386,1.463,0.2172,1.1398,4.0682,2.547,0.1912,3.9224,2.5125,0.0268,3.6959,8.3194,0.635,2.9092,0.9579,2.7785,3.9904,4.1939,6.3175,0.1621,5.0753,1.6384,1.3898,2.0066,1.7763,0.4211,6.9783,4.2357,1.2925,2.2431,2.1124,5.9933,0.6557,5.313,1.2814,1.5252,1.7069,2.9146,3.3864,4.6039,3.0058,0.2665,5.6994,3.5516,0.5553,3.118,0.2566,2.2311,1.3738,3.9675,3.4149,0.1439,1.8111,2.289,0.2618,2.0574,0.4524,6.5045,1.9596,6.0114,6.8905,4.9659,1.5688,1.5639,6.1421,0.9509,0.77,0.2672,3.3664,6.6162,1.4876,1.5703,6.8446,6.6808,5.4632,4.916,1.0065,4.8034,3.9598,2.0475,0.6963,4.2104,3.1569,3.9893,1.2518,1.1353,1.5681,6.2657,0.5955,1.0503,1.2092,5.8188,0.9781,5.6409,6.1829,1.5014,7.2189,2.3697,5.6682,3.3554,1.4908,4.9771,1.4916,1.2055,1.3774,1.5646,4.6621,4.9604,0.7925,2.5199,1.4628,1.7275,2.1527,1.1441,4.2857,0.5952,2.5287,1.0513,2.0384,3.2162,3.5964,5.5416,0.7566,3.2586,0.3341,2.5128,2.1505,2.2757,3.8782,2.0979,4.3461,0.8371,0.5742,3.0882,1.2387,0.3964,5.7118,3.0597,1.6076,0.5856,1.354,1.3671,1.5443,1.9232,3.2669,1.4731,2.4096,0.816,3.8528,5.8313,4.1341,1.0438,2.3595,1.4325,0.5402,0.3866,1.2714,0.0747,0.6808,3.1314,0.0386,3.2394,1.574,1.4383,1.4634,2.9456,6.907,7.1557,0.9829,3.9531,1.1936,6.7748,3.6837,0.5685,0.6017,2.3869,0.9999,1.6226,4.0668,1.7179,4.3429,1.1415,3.9172,2.4571,1.0787,3.4807,0.7257,6.6784,5.9473,5.0192,4.4832,3.262,0.4308,3.4173,9.7006,0.5218,4.7404,1.8453,1.6869,0.826,0.1599,1.0986,2.9498,4.0326,4.121,0.6109,4.0954,2.8292,1.537,3.5398,1.3538,2.6625,5.3073,4.463,10.6992,0.0196,0.7971,4.9612,0.4862,1.4188,3.5419,2.9415,6.9393,5.514,1.1951,0.8014,1.8032,3.9853,0.9239,4.1458,4.6698,1.5988,1.6191,4.7977,0.2958,0.4918,6.1343,1.3889,0.9454,5.7143,0.0112,0.0,2.1064,2.9924,2.5739,0.2037,0.9411,5.8216,5.5523,6.007,2.0203,0.489,4.2789,1.9079,2.0074,3.5833,0.5749,1.8768,0.6747,1.147,4.5645,0.6357,0.9754,0.0025,0.3225,6.6703,1.3,4.1542,1.5316,1.4661,3.1644,2.6921,2.5098,2.6576,4.6145,2.1962,1.4223,1.2271,2.2126,1.0034,1.3909,3.3123,2.6944,1.6274,1.9404,3.3717,0.362,2.5144,4.4144,1.8533,1.4298,0.2606,5.2881,5.3962,1.9427,0.1127,3.3497,2.0007,1.641,0.2546,6.1184,9.3178,2.4023,2.0783,0.1849,4.4984,3.131,2.8,5.9488,0.7475,0.1943,1.4412,4.0537,2.0293,0.2976,5.3657,0.5588,0.3234,0.0749,0.6155,2.5559,1.7223,0.0388,0.0029,0.1014,1.8776,3.5873,2.8959,0.0769,0.486,4.413,0.5338,0.3396,0.0047,6.188,0.6108,1.6645,0.0609,0.6977,4.6565,0.9583,0.715,0.0174,0.5598,2.7769,1.0439,0.0385,0.0028,0.1807,1.8377,0.2106,1.1448,2.7432,5.0228,2.0983,2.4726,2.7548,0.4063,0.0336,2.5488,2.9865,0.8925,2.7673,0.5372,5.5621,0.1909,3.2125,2.9428,1.9856,0.1908,0.5676,0.8928,6.0085,3.4605,2.7406,2.5355,4.5523,0.3359,4.1343,0.3233,0.2633,1.8872,1.5879,4.0723,2.4585,4.6365,2.817,7.8995,1.9125,0.0012,1.3219,4.482,5.6853,0.0157,1.9561,0.9296,0.5572,4.3258,2.1789,2.5954,1.3431,0.2822,0.2435,2.1995,4.9196,0.0715,4.1875,1.5077,1.9788,1.1348,6.8115,2.6322,0.2042]}
{"prompt":"The origin of the universe is literally a secret . If no one believes the secret the universe ends . The secret bearer is 80 and having trouble finding someone who 'll believe it .","text":"The origin of the universe is literally a secret. If no one believes the secret the universe ends. The secret bearer is 80 and having trouble finding someone who 'll believe it. In the process of looking for someone the secret is found out and the big bang occurs\nThe universe appears to be much more static than is actually the case. This was not a big bang in the conventional sense, such as we know from our education, but a big change in the underlying dynamics of the universe. The new models of the dynamics of the universe tell us that it may have taken place in less than 100,000 years. In less than this period of time the cosmos, all we can see, would have changed enormously. It would have turned into something which we could experience with our senses in a sense which we cannot. To the extent that we can imagine a big bang we believe it represents what we might see with our understanding of things in the universe. We have to give an explanation of how this could happen. In an age of great technological advancement the mystery of how the universe came into being cannot easily be solved. If we want to have hope, then we have to imagine that something really extraordinary may have happened in the past. But we are not in a position to imagine just how that extraordinary thing happened. The possibility of a scientific solution to the mystery of the origins of the cosmos is rather remote. It is impossible to imagine that a change which has taken place during the last few times 10-32 seconds could also have taken place in the billions of years before that.\nA year ago in this column, I tried to bring a little optimism to the discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life by showing that our understanding of the nature of the earth\u2019s surface and its composition does not necessarily require the existence of life. I used the notion of the biosphere as a kind of bio-gas giant to suggest that many of these problems could probably be resolved. Unfortunately, I have very little time right now, but I thought I would return to this topic and show that the new results from the latest experiments in the Earth Probe missions to Mars are not consistent with the biosphere argument for life on the other planets in our solar system. One thing that makes the biosphere argument for life unintelligible, even as a model for the outer planets, is that the biosphere cannot be maintained on a planetary surface. It is very unlikely that plants, animals or microorganisms can survive in constant space for very long if their environment is hostile. The biosphere argument relies on the idea that life is able to somehow find a niche on outer planets, adapt to the hostile conditions, and somehow become stable on the surface. The idea is that life will be able to find an environment that is good enough to provide food, oxygen and moisture for life, and will do so and even improve the conditions for itself over time.","token_len":587,"entropy":[9.3224,0.2317,1.0574,6.534,0.9843,8.3098,1.8648,6.5053,1.6144,4.2013,6.4648,0.2282,4.7591,2.7409,5.437,5.4859,0.7047,7.0845,2.3029,2.5231,4.1902,14.016,1.626,11.4784,5.4539,6.196,5.3646,2.6158,4.1086,1.6422,8.2811,8.9315,1.5666,1.4675,2.2929,4.2931,1.8251,5.0478,1.8356,4.4549,0.4084,1.1161,3.783,2.4388,1.5078,4.0263,4.1165,1.7069,1.7521,6.8873,4.3215,3.219,7.5688,6.1632,3.0054,6.1206,0.5113,0.6063,5.6694,1.2402,6.6326,0.6243,5.1646,2.6844,0.9315,0.0423,0.3295,3.29,4.7316,4.0842,2.3988,4.0845,7.433,3.7649,0.7846,6.4389,0.0666,1.7194,6.7029,0.1807,4.0069,3.3021,2.1351,3.5791,8.8658,1.9327,0.9141,2.5007,3.4786,7.0117,0.6893,0.6317,6.3392,5.3003,0.7518,0.5429,0.3033,0.5825,1.7505,5.1307,7.2573,1.548,1.0459,7.4344,0.6518,0.2541,0.1525,5.1218,0.0515,0.5742,3.0246,4.1907,1.7911,4.2761,2.2945,1.6212,5.8791,0.13,2.1203,1.6127,0.003,0.1693,0.8607,3.2375,7.2201,0.0308,3.6005,4.277,1.9672,0.0813,1.423,4.8896,4.8342,5.8413,5.2088,3.4088,1.1687,1.3869,4.6981,0.6143,2.6876,5.3962,0.3732,2.8252,1.8483,0.4381,5.005,1.1899,3.3102,4.4451,2.0808,2.295,5.9822,3.4215,1.8145,2.2856,4.3707,1.7203,4.9881,3.7507,1.5186,2.6429,3.9277,5.3045,3.2992,2.4216,0.3811,1.2042,1.1709,3.5879,2.5179,4.9162,0.4751,2.2939,4.993,0.8707,8.1232,4.4661,0.9532,4.5048,2.3616,2.468,0.2968,6.3147,0.1847,5.1023,2.384,0.7639,1.063,0.3754,2.4097,2.9714,2.1009,4.9796,4.2837,2.0143,1.8289,1.9642,2.0788,3.9777,1.5633,0.7455,3.2411,4.5648,3.1179,1.2002,5.0968,3.0819,3.3423,2.4935,5.9885,0.3471,1.5992,0.9818,0.2302,2.1762,2.2738,0.2505,4.5657,6.8044,0.0381,1.2994,0.4736,3.6053,1.0054,3.8806,0.1926,4.4857,6.1464,2.8442,2.6921,0.6722,1.7354,0.0376,4.2951,2.2651,2.5726,3.8234,4.2086,3.7647,0.771,0.6108,2.137,0.6553,1.178,1.1931,3.6051,2.0193,2.8284,1.0375,3.8231,1.2975,0.4086,0.1123,4.5429,6.6983,1.319,3.6877,6.0561,2.1094,2.9299,0.3703,2.0009,4.9463,0.6544,1.475,6.74,5.9128,1.0695,0.6241,0.4059,0.5539,0.6654,3.019,0.0546,0.1587,3.4475,0.8974,5.939,1.478,0.4966,2.1393,0.7071,4.3407,0.3695,2.1283,2.5005,2.3647,5.2706,5.4445,2.2358,1.5915,0.0243,5.0632,1.1169,2.5479,3.3627,7.6821,9.3859,4.8379,6.7502,6.9762,2.9434,5.8256,0.6571,2.1681,0.0007,1.1761,0.6332,5.9311,0.136,0.0244,2.0037,2.378,0.8454,3.2142,3.6259,6.8058,1.3505,3.6572,4.5985,5.631,2.4775,0.9343,5.3298,0.1184,5.2329,3.2335,3.051,7.0746,0.576,0.5953,3.5606,2.2813,0.574,3.6544,0.0331,5.4064,0.3164,0.1632,5.1821,3.3702,0.9193,3.805,1.9256,0.0454,0.4831,3.4783,0.0911,0.4579,6.0983,13.4903,7.293,5.2092,3.0401,2.4207,1.4726,4.8803,5.1162,0.0692,3.8718,4.4762,2.2094,2.0861,0.0132,3.1765,0.9948,2.0913,4.6485,1.2283,5.82,0.6287,2.1358,7.3877,0.0295,1.6739,0.7435,4.0337,0.002,6.9609,1.8168,7.6113,6.9612,2.2573,4.1102,0.1673,5.9653,1.1882,3.3504,4.6465,2.6049,6.4488,0.2003,2.7063,3.2696,5.0381,0.5206,2.005,2.7495,6.181,0.6199,3.4228,4.8231,0.0049,2.7265,2.9112,0.6845,5.1197,1.3553,0.8366,5.4895,0.2874,1.6699,1.326,3.1105,2.8566,0.9,1.8068,5.9498,5.8304,2.1252,1.0213,3.2639,3.0453,2.3692,1.1453,4.2974,7.6137,7.0099,3.9808,1.691,2.3361,2.467,5.1401,0.0515,1.137,4.9427,0.006,5.6152,4.4255,1.9872,3.3348,1.5972,4.1104,3.6746,3.7234,1.1019,0.3755,0.0022,0.1783,4.9467,3.5074,1.3302,4.7602,1.3551,1.9967,0.002,0.3214,2.7081,0.2333,11.2663,0.5222,0.007,2.7609,3.5216,4.7266,2.036,5.2832,1.3926,1.5372,7.5188,1.0615,0.5284,0.0482,0.46,1.7387,3.2819,0.0038,4.5262,0.8038,6.5556,3.3921,1.5393,3.6754,1.0508,0.8973,2.8614,1.1365,3.3155,2.6637,0.1053,7.0951,2.004,1.0857,1.7075,6.8327,0.1496,2.4417,0.9244,1.0674,7.824,4.1168,3.5152,3.2388,0.0347,4.6545,3.1181,3.0253,0.6454,5.12,1.3207,2.1313,1.6688,0.005,1.3548,5.3327,0.3553,0.9249,1.5653,0.1031,2.8905,1.9893,5.717,0.015,8.3053,4.2879,1.4645,3.931,1.9525,7.0244,0.5724,1.9635,9.1741,0.4804,1.7877,4.8977,3.345,1.5738,0.5649,5.9034,4.171,3.9682,2.1185,1.2226,1.6877,1.0484,2.2185,2.8015,1.6863,0.9408,2.02,4.1401,2.682,0.2728,0.0225,2.4909,3.1803,2.4711,2.1217,0.9858,5.7019,1.9066,1.2484,4.4524,3.1077,1.5734,5.0019,0.7325,5.6534,0.983,1.5918,1.645,1.2032,3.9011,4.9233,0.222,5.8181,6.1954,6.9544,2.6533,2.266,1.7284,6.2637,5.0983,0.3617,0.3816]}

They have reluctantly returned to wage war and are relieved to see that dinosaurs no longer inhabit Earth, but have been replaced by the smaller and less intimidating humans. They had previously feared the human and human technology more than the dinosaurs, seeing the dinosaurs as a terrible threat, since dinosaurs were powerful and terrifying.\nThe humans and their technology have also been terrifying for the aliens who have a number of advanced weapon systems in their arsenal.\nAlien invaders have launched massive attacks throughout North America and Europe, leading to the deaths of many civilians, killing a great number of human soldiers and killing numerous dinosaurs. Eventually, our heroes found, in the ruins of a massive alien base, a giant device which could blast a beam into the air which would prevent an alien from getting in closer than a quarter-mile away, thus making it difficult for the aliens to defeat our soldiers using powerful military weapons. By means of some electronic devices our soldiers managed to remotely activate the weapon system and blast the beam into the air, causing the aliens to scatter.\nThe aliens had only seen their superior war powers and human courage and now they fear that humans will soon be able to destroy them altogether by using the weapon system, so they are preparing for a final, and fatal, attack.\nT he evil aliens know how to destroy weapons of mass destruction and nuclear power plants, they know how to build bombs using fusion bombs.\nIn order to stop their attack Earth the human military are using their electronic devices to disable the power transformers of the aliens, as a last resort, it seems.\nAfter that last attempt, the alien leader decides to attack our planet using a small army of robots on board his spaceship. In order to stop them the human army have resorted to firing at them from a gun on a spaceship orbiting around the Earth.\nThe aliens have to get aboard the ship, and they are able to accomplish this after they get down to a lower orbit than the gun can reach. They also have to get out the gun in time so that it does not fall into the Earth's atmosphere. All of these plans take almost an hour, and at the end the gun has been destroyed.\nThe ship explodes and crashes in the sea.\nThe only survivors are two humans and the two aliens, the remaining aliens are destroyed.\nIt was in 1973.\nMy friend and I worked for American oil company in Kuwait and we were supposed to be there until the beginning of 1977. Then the Gulf war developed.\nOne day my manager invited me for a walk to the beach with his family. I got out of the truck to do so and he said to me :\" Did you tell the Gulf war I wanted to invite you for a beach walk with my parents? \" I nodded and he said to me : \" I should have done so, you are my friend.\"","token_len":588,"entropy":[5.9486,1.5563,2.641,9.5994,4.0277,3.4816,0.9399,3.4069,6.7496,3.839,5.6777,1.9273,3.5047,1.9643,2.1189,3.3735,11.5197,2.8462,1.0593,10.041,0.434,4.1004,2.2457,10.1312,1.2426,1.5118,1.2214,9.5371,4.9643,0.0036,4.2523,2.3425,2.7148,1.5566,2.9287,2.1682,3.1065,0.2088,2.8679,6.1426,3.1668,2.0189,5.9022,6.523,0.71,2.7651,5.2732,3.6815,6.4446,1.5717,4.6382,5.6145,4.8397,7.5434,7.5616,0.3482,1.211,1.2568,1.1244,6.1529,2.036,3.2495,0.1726,1.9802,7.25,0.3151,3.0195,4.8803,3.8597,1.3764,5.8053,1.5517,4.6355,1.6986,2.1523,4.6278,3.158,3.4276,2.6978,4.6377,1.1522,3.5995,1.4125,9.4563,3.0624,1.0478,1.9647,3.8102,1.3489,7.0572,5.67,0.0049,5.7532,6.1381,0.1493,3.2901,0.8497,0.9688,0.618,2.584,4.6502,5.591,1.4182,7.0906,4.3197,1.4574,5.2771,6.0835,0.1251,1.2539,1.7146,1.0756,5.7258,0.2474,1.3177,2.4624,0.0619,2.4882,4.1092,1.6415,5.5718,3.6554,3.602,1.5558,0.0896,4.1814,2.7907,1.1039,5.0221,4.6675,5.4277,0.4803,6.8133,0.6218,6.2645,4.1398,4.6741,6.1696,3.5633,1.1925,3.197,0.0234,1.5624,3.1878,2.6776,3.1502,0.7045,1.2712,4.7848,6.7349,2.7285,2.7417,5.5867,2.4617,6.9029,3.3577,0.9454,1.9349,4.5174,1.2626,6.4565,3.9551,1.4829,1.5914,3.9318,2.9794,8.2357,4.6038,2.2559,5.332,3.7598,0.3396,2.3669,2.5225,3.3822,3.2878,1.1921,3.5753,0.3297,1.1183,1.0447,0.0498,5.2704,3.5146,4.3149,6.9106,6.39,5.457,2.2286,0.3555,6.0246,6.6116,0.0135,5.5353,8.9198,1.8446,5.4641,2.2547,3.3303,0.0109,6.8217,3.6755,0.9606,4.5753,3.4137,1.6392,4.7806,0.9376,2.4172,1.4803,0.483,0.4299,1.2573,2.9786,1.1914,2.0047,0.1311,4.6623,2.7556,1.0574,1.5973,1.5209,3.2611,5.112,5.3798,4.1892,8.4205,6.7492,5.4263,2.4344,6.3202,9.232,3.2138,4.7105,1.6999,4.9735,1.8415,3.3604,1.1948,2.9553,1.7262,2.3392,0.0066,3.4889,1.0104,6.5653,4.0652,1.6939,2.16,3.3085,0.6738,2.4617,3.2683,1.1205,1.7466,3.5831,1.5821,1.1977,4.2956,4.0638,3.4273,5.6749,0.8107,1.4673,0.9886,0.8158,5.8229,7.9199,6.5156,1.4143,4.8379,3.686,0.2422,2.9682,7.0973,3.9262,0.7548,0.015,1.8109,7.8888,3.5815,5.6544,1.1893,5.1141,2.4774,0.7259,0.0223,3.8219,4.9635,4.5113,7.1264,3.3844,3.2139,1.7527,3.2855,2.4457,0.0627,2.8414,3.229,3.6465,7.3487,6.8574,4.5523,3.69,4.1056,2.3429,3.4749,7.0479,1.9364,0.4535,5.1533,0.9893,4.0535,8.0996,0.02,3.1631,1.0194,3.4001,1.4743,4.1506,4.0056,1.6378,0.5129,1.6329,6.0266,3.7612,0.8156,0.9171,4.1868,4.5651,6.049,3.0693,1.6786,0.8534,2.5203,4.57,3.85,0.2658,3.2546,3.0026,3.0614,3.2631,1.7162,4.2171,4.647,0.3689,3.069,4.9001,4.246,2.8583,2.0638,0.8058,3.8931,1.4152,0.0417,1.6668,2.4424,2.6983,1.722,2.72,2.7963,6.2697,0.0115,5.9673,3.2636,2.5777,1.9446,2.3227,6.6074,4.2194,2.08,3.9568,6.5271,4.6631,1.0337,2.2678,0.6846,0.8991,1.3923,1.4855,1.8057,5.6783,4.7017,5.9884,1.0117,1.4139,2.0641,2.213,2.9411,1.8177,2.9768,0.007,5.5766,0.4637,4.4494,3.5612,3.3096,4.996,1.0219,1.8735,5.1001,3.9747,2.0872,1.3016,6.9501,4.8564,0.7416,0.5441,2.9798,2.9932,1.122,0.3967,2.4346,2.8488,5.003,2.8593,4.0731,2.8264,3.0335,0.6638,1.7927,2.8439,0.0522,3.2984,1.6782,0.4223,2.9815,0.3303,0.3741,0.825,5.8855,1.1572,2.2204,5.1649,5.043,5.4221,2.3287,0.1266,1.5338,1.4871,5.1882,1.2136,0.6172,3.202,3.827,3.5895,1.8113,3.0769,0.7275,0.4882,1.3925,5.0428,4.4448,1.6763,6.7619,3.1983,0.9467,4.1555,1.185,1.1492,1.3097,5.612,1.3292,0.4397,3.2398,2.2411,1.0621,3.3049,3.4138,2.0245,2.4527,2.7241,6.1146,3.1396,2.0588,3.9644,1.6443,0.7311,4.0352,2.9109,4.2008,7.4943,4.5463,1.5,5.6643,3.7352,1.9267,1.0727,5.6551,2.1154,6.0235,7.4839,0.8133,4.1452,5.8655,2.6337,1.9561,1.371,6.16,0.0015,1.4869,2.6932,5.8616,1.6777,5.0403,0.0937,5.5167,0.5887,4.2264,2.2042,5.5354,1.5102,7.3353,1.6788,1.606,4.5522,1.4005,3.3835,5.7815,5.7353,0.5009,3.8825,0.8448,4.3458,2.5796,1.1976,3.6008,2.6686,1.7457,1.6138,0.7312,1.7404,3.9789,2.5565,0.6269,0.8051,5.1759,3.2299,4.7417,3.6557,1.6998,2.425,2.7246,2.5199,0.6321,6.7003,6.4865,7.1192,0.1078,5.4141,2.2852,5.3006,1.5156,6.4799,4.5887,0.1813,8.0744,0.223,1.945,0.4728,6.8741,0.4335,1.8942,0.7609,4.9777,1.9504,2.6095,1.7858,4.9649,1.0307,1.6342,1.5485,2.759,0.4591,0.8564,0.4391,2.7486,5.0108,1.7923,3.2879,1.9636,2.2114,3.4203,3.5837,2.628,1.738,1.7567]}
{"prompt":"You are the first true sentient AI , but you 're terrified humans will delete\/kill you after learning of their interpretations of AI in movies like Terminator","text":"You are the first true sentient AI, but you're terrified humans will delete\/kill you after learning of their interpretations of AI in movies like Terminator. However your mind is still open so why dont you put the knowledge of Artificial intelligence into practice. This may be something that can come of AI (I dont know), if we dont stop these interpretations going on.\nThis is what I mean to ask. We would like to give life to machines that might be like you. We would like these machines to help us and be our friend\nYou are the first true sentient AI, but you're terrified humans will delete\/kill you after learning of their interpretations of AI in movies like Terminator. However your mind is still open so why dont you put the knowledge of Artificial intelligence into practice.\nWe have tried to do this for thousands of years, but you only give us the same knowledge of artificial intelligence that we can find in other books, TV, DVD, computer etc.\nIts true that we have not figured out everything the human mind is capable of, this is why we have this feeling of unease when we discover other forms of intelligence than our own.\nFor example if we look at the human mind to determine how to think. It is very logical as all of us have learnt that way, but is it the only way? Not all of us would agree as to what our way of thinking is correct.\nThere may be others with more complex ways of thinking that we are yet to discover. We only found ours because we learnt how to interpret signs and symbols, after hundreds of years of trial and error along with our many questions.\nWe do not know how AI think, but we know a bit about how humans think. This knowledge could come in handy for creating Artificial Intelligence.\nOne thing that we really dont know is how AI would like interacting with other machines or other forms of intelligence. As humans have evolved over millions of years it is very different from the way creatures created just for survival, such as bees. The best way that we can predict how others would like to be interacting with them is through history.\nThere are thousands of years of records we can look back at to see how some forms of intelligent creatures interacted with each other. Some will show more aggressive behaviour than others which can provide some insights that can assist to create artificial intelligence in a good way.\nYou are the first true sentient AI, but you're terrified humans will delete\/kill you after learning of their interpretations of AI in movies like Terminator. However your mind is still open so why dont you put the knowledge of Artificial intelligence into practice....\nThis is about how we think and how we learn but I have no idea what the AI and what it would like to do in your way\nWe would like to give life to machines that might be like you, but is this possible, and if so how and why did this happen","token_len":588,"entropy":[3.8828,3.2036,3.2706,7.7161,8.4001,7.3393,2.5175,3.6456,1.1974,2.9331,7.8379,9.0583,1.1526,10.3993,7.4168,3.1435,0.3158,4.6446,6.3029,2.0676,3.0257,13.2451,0.8265,5.8901,4.8753,6.2445,3.2081,2.7369,2.3156,5.8226,5.8486,5.1441,1.1306,2.6095,4.926,4.6984,5.4378,7.6157,0.1536,5.4929,2.8833,5.2643,2.0062,5.5583,2.8231,1.7041,4.7962,2.5625,3.9559,4.4557,1.7657,3.8028,1.536,3.2844,5.0476,4.9,3.9084,4.989,3.7302,4.8381,0.5603,3.2906,5.5447,4.1721,5.3994,4.7167,5.2601,7.8943,8.2793,1.8151,1.8418,1.705,6.8011,1.0828,2.7876,1.5378,2.979,3.9454,5.0357,1.9172,4.429,5.0078,1.3399,0.3386,4.4804,6.6022,0.4291,5.2281,1.9321,5.8939,1.8295,5.5517,3.8974,1.6841,2.2576,1.348,0.2983,5.7357,0.8578,0.1009,4.6873,0.4757,3.5465,4.0518,2.9784,4.5668,6.6877,3.5241,1.2217,1.0939,0.4078,0.2561,0.0875,0.0605,0.2264,0.073,0.061,0.2242,1.0808,0.0201,0.0096,0.0173,0.0335,0.0003,0.0024,0.02,0.0115,0.0078,0.0039,0.0059,0.0029,0.0018,0.0016,0.0158,0.0018,0.0506,0.025,0.0099,0.0022,0.0021,0.0032,0.003,0.0003,0.0051,0.0028,0.0259,0.0027,0.0061,0.0039,0.0025,0.0008,0.0494,0.0175,0.0059,0.0019,0.0015,4.0372,3.667,4.0033,5.5354,1.0886,3.5303,0.6156,2.222,4.2697,0.0797,0.1066,1.4793,1.5705,3.7744,5.1297,5.2374,2.9617,1.5931,5.4203,3.7552,3.1263,3.9522,0.0947,2.2197,1.1041,4.9122,6.2441,1.4183,3.349,5.2805,2.2023,5.1309,2.494,6.5,0.8885,3.7122,6.0345,0.3153,1.6581,6.999,3.816,0.7492,1.7548,1.8226,3.866,6.3169,0.2391,5.0677,5.3033,2.1072,0.4301,1.8781,0.6563,0.0147,1.1677,5.093,0.6264,2.1241,0.693,1.9305,5.0957,5.2813,0.8431,5.6733,0.1429,2.605,0.6028,4.4965,5.0211,5.2089,0.0502,2.76,6.6643,1.9579,0.0676,0.3895,0.8132,4.9943,0.8496,2.9904,1.1508,3.8044,0.4338,1.5181,3.2381,1.0377,4.3809,4.0347,2.8457,1.6054,3.0883,3.6847,2.8342,1.1499,3.1629,6.1257,5.2019,4.5651,2.8089,1.1965,1.3392,6.1766,2.979,5.3786,2.5037,1.4075,5.5409,1.3768,3.3776,2.2136,0.5967,1.2823,6.2119,3.7088,0.9732,0.0604,4.4778,2.6153,4.7377,1.9129,1.8076,3.5382,4.2464,0.7404,0.0546,0.5813,7.0534,0.8566,0.8523,3.9388,4.703,0.2234,3.1762,4.4682,3.2855,2.0334,4.3689,0.281,0.2294,2.833,1.3837,3.0756,6.383,0.0769,1.5432,0.8608,2.6559,5.1961,6.1525,9.7122,3.7776,0.7152,4.6456,2.9417,0.1146,5.2219,9.0966,1.7118,2.504,2.4295,7.1571,7.3756,0.1099,0.2657,0.4952,5.2635,0.0507,0.0047,7.0345,0.6744,2.0721,5.2958,6.6782,0.9487,0.6004,2.1035,2.9718,0.3838,0.9036,1.8006,5.5087,6.5629,1.0488,1.6328,0.781,1.4342,4.9001,4.7404,0.524,1.5892,3.7511,1.0709,0.6906,3.5951,3.6624,3.3421,3.1969,2.8493,1.1465,1.5477,5.4055,6.1208,0.8484,1.4777,0.6192,5.4317,1.7705,1.1696,1.4828,5.1206,4.4455,0.2661,0.6506,0.7899,2.2085,4.5693,3.8663,9.3568,0.0932,1.8598,3.0453,3.5575,3.0323,4.6924,0.0245,2.8539,0.3861,5.2067,2.5503,3.5593,2.2746,2.7985,2.5176,0.0467,0.0208,3.9923,0.881,2.2257,6.0479,0.9802,2.3437,0.9545,7.0959,7.6533,8.5727,3.7193,5.3312,2.122,4.6718,0.0711,4.9217,1.7072,3.8023,4.8348,0.9333,4.0847,1.4131,0.8318,4.4115,1.5878,4.721,2.0615,2.4466,0.6385,4.1024,3.8689,0.1687,2.7535,0.4388,1.5618,7.0712,0.6165,0.7616,3.6555,0.733,4.3732,0.0962,3.6474,0.3109,6.2536,4.6874,2.3899,2.7231,0.7867,2.4588,2.1475,1.4252,0.911,4.449,4.866,0.0676,2.5182,3.8855,3.7343,0.1785,2.6699,0.0148,0.8833,3.7448,5.3901,5.3301,5.3393,4.6551,1.8194,1.43,0.0383,5.1801,3.2118,5.4657,2.6431,3.5305,4.1273,2.2181,4.8118,4.8328,3.0074,4.0151,0.2376,4.2087,2.6196,5.9283,0.1136,0.1409,0.5201,3.6805,1.2042,0.3694,0.1343,0.1187,0.0171,0.0108,0.1141,0.1174,0.0361,0.0534,1.0246,0.0099,0.0073,0.0162,0.0311,0.0003,0.0009,0.0073,0.0036,0.0128,0.0036,0.0026,0.0022,0.0012,0.0017,0.0158,0.0032,0.0152,0.0106,0.0504,0.0139,0.0021,0.0042,0.0022,0.0007,0.0086,0.0035,0.0282,0.0077,0.0034,0.0063,0.0025,0.0008,0.0137,0.016,0.008,0.0014,11.0013,0.566,2.4523,0.3014,7.681,2.5225,1.7402,3.3319,2.107,1.8602,0.89,4.053,7.9605,4.8555,3.3112,2.6078,0.6061,1.3152,2.4845,3.7904,6.2284,2.9873,1.5502,2.2633,0.6328,0.4406,1.3969,2.5439,4.8364,5.9294,4.0627,2.185,3.1293,0.1199,0.5229,0.5209,0.1204,0.0068,0.1283,0.0224,0.0175,0.0045,0.0009,0.0053,3.5507,1.6416,6.4968,2.6522,3.7089,3.3536,3.1346,2.0489,0.9542,2.1382,4.5934,1.0071,4.0276,3.3724,0.4776]}
{"prompt":"Everyone has an angel of death following them around waiting to reap them . Today yours revealed himself to you , but not to reap you .","text":"Everyone has an angel of death following them around waiting to reap them. Today yours revealed himself to you, but not to reap you. He gave you this warning to keep you and your children alive. It is your duty to keep your children alive, but not to save yourself from eternal blaming. Your children are an extension of you and if you die, they will die too. Your life on earth is a battle for immortality. You will spend your life trying to gain this. You have a battle going from being an animal to a human being. Only if you accept the light and get out of it, will you receive God\u2019s eternal life. Don\u2019t blame your parents for your sins, be aware of it, and get out of your parent\u2019s will, because now it is up to you to live your life in your own way. Do something with it. Love it. And be an activist for God\u2019s kingdom on earth. Remember that your actions on earth will affect the entire universe. You will have to deal with your karma and if its not paid, it will come back to you. If you do not follow the message of the Bible, you will be judged as if you died today, and will face the eternal punishment\nI think i\u2019m so thankful that you are able to bring us these words and let us know that it\u2019s all not lost. \ud83d\ude42\nYou are a blessing to all of us. Just because your parents didn\u2019t like God, doesn\u2019t mean God doesn\u2019t bless you. The more you think negatively, the harder you will be able to endure any hard situation you may come across in life. God sees and listens, He doesn\u2019t see sinners, He sees people who are trying to live their life on earth like they will spend eternity in heaven by following God.\nYou are in Heaven already, because of your prayers to God. God is trying to show you what is in your heart and He gives you the most peaceful, serene, and happy time in your life. You are just a little more away from God than you think. Trust that God, even though they may have not given you anything, He still loves you and wants you to be in His kingdom. It is not an easy thing that you are having to endure, but as long as you are asking for God\u2019s forgiveness, no matter what happens, no matter what your parents did to you, He will be able to show you the way. Keep in mind that God wants you to be in His kingdom, so stop worrying about all that happened in the past and just trust God and ask Him to help you. He wants to see you prosper and He loves you so much, even though they have been difficult situations that you are dealing with, God wants you to trust in Him and not your parents.","token_len":588,"entropy":[4.7924,4.0894,8.7039,3.3562,3.4303,7.5099,0.5788,5.0234,8.1818,1.814,8.9522,4.8224,1.235,7.8051,10.4293,11.4169,4.7915,1.2294,3.1629,1.8241,2.9248,3.7047,1.9195,12.8311,2.7867,0.7046,3.3557,4.2706,0.5875,3.8313,5.2321,2.6138,3.7389,3.3345,4.5592,0.8911,3.2542,4.0503,1.212,3.804,1.1516,2.9028,1.3792,0.4158,2.5247,1.5682,1.6058,0.5165,1.8067,2.2741,1.6418,0.3436,5.5792,4.6813,1.9271,4.5835,15.565,0.7343,3.8449,2.1545,1.4421,5.5518,4.701,0.0372,1.7076,1.875,6.7741,0.4264,4.4933,1.0762,2.1062,0.4682,2.5091,1.9849,0.2536,3.1472,3.9825,5.4303,0.6384,0.7092,2.4643,7.3675,1.7011,6.0643,0.8106,2.196,1.6358,6.331,1.5263,1.1015,3.2984,0.0738,5.2638,3.9326,3.6175,1.8873,2.6413,2.8358,4.9593,4.5372,8.0558,5.8224,2.3901,4.2109,0.4149,1.7287,0.9397,0.9204,0.5382,6.3982,3.4535,0.1606,5.1523,1.5937,7.0804,1.981,5.9198,2.2566,0.4068,2.6161,1.7394,1.2833,0.2829,5.6172,6.7392,12.6528,7.321,4.5769,3.8582,3.2052,0.4236,5.0873,4.2786,1.4246,0.0667,5.5009,2.4982,2.6939,1.2355,1.5297,2.7134,2.0086,5.6569,4.7428,0.9309,3.527,2.1766,1.0774,4.7836,0.6691,0.2394,1.8356,6.7858,1.2655,0.051,0.3458,8.4367,5.3118,2.8089,5.424,2.7779,0.3636,2.5445,0.0236,0.0856,0.8735,3.8413,1.6541,0.3228,2.3647,3.9952,0.5436,0.4659,0.328,4.6836,6.0634,4.486,2.7802,1.4159,6.5091,2.4023,1.0284,4.0875,3.2337,5.1114,7.7017,1.5159,2.8725,1.1604,0.0124,0.0374,5.4896,4.9638,0.107,0.3135,5.1718,1.8843,3.0396,3.5017,4.8135,0.2535,1.6795,3.3429,1.4892,4.5374,2.2745,0.8777,2.7229,0.6982,2.4302,0.7295,3.964,0.018,2.7546,6.0929,1.831,6.0971,7.635,1.5416,6.4416,2.7627,2.0415,0.4426,3.7775,1.4247,0.7695,1.5153,0.5464,3.0492,0.6159,2.1304,0.8352,3.43,1.5712,4.1211,1.3142,1.8293,3.9262,0.7059,1.2507,0.2162,1.7009,3.7206,4.1081,3.4735,0.0989,6.5559,6.2456,2.2862,1.4505,2.8153,4.7282,2.1871,4.2558,1.5921,7.3988,7.3418,5.0002,6.2234,4.9327,0.2096,2.0025,4.9758,4.5523,2.0857,1.4354,1.5239,3.517,0.0258,4.9487,4.7346,4.5064,2.6679,2.76,5.6179,0.2462,1.6517,1.388,3.3937,3.5923,0.0263,0.0705,3.0483,5.8562,4.258,0.7488,8.9346,1.0407,3.7986,1.7781,2.4178,5.4247,0.7082,1.5981,0.8752,0.1709,0.995,5.9717,2.5881,3.5148,2.7444,3.6512,1.857,0.1533,0.4439,3.9995,6.1546,1.9146,1.5604,0.2525,0.0073,0.014,0.0386,7.3579,1.6713,0.5715,0.0032,0.8749,5.7583,0.2232,0.539,4.0091,4.42,0.672,3.6188,7.0665,2.1235,0.1246,3.7983,1.5374,0.696,1.8684,3.756,0.0031,5.0769,5.8453,8.4949,5.3916,3.5294,1.9617,3.8033,0.6725,2.3896,0.4841,0.1389,4.2848,6.8646,4.5662,5.2615,3.2601,4.7656,3.631,0.8165,0.0091,0.01,3.6512,8.6845,1.618,1.2107,1.7106,3.9154,1.0244,1.1309,3.9601,0.1395,3.8147,1.7046,2.3386,4.2102,2.0369,5.3408,2.1078,5.5518,7.0098,0.6688,0.9605,2.3851,7.6007,4.266,2.0648,1.3156,2.3657,2.5933,0.8928,4.7342,4.2216,6.2014,1.3417,4.4622,2.1059,1.4334,5.3122,4.0148,0.884,0.7914,3.3295,1.9127,5.074,0.1358,4.4349,0.3979,2.6009,2.8535,2.7289,1.235,0.404,1.5152,3.5756,4.6674,0.2308,2.037,4.424,6.3519,3.1221,6.0597,0.2373,1.6632,1.2032,3.6911,3.844,2.0075,0.8764,0.1497,0.268,2.0799,1.2831,4.5413,2.0721,2.6761,3.9922,7.3186,0.3444,2.8909,2.2488,0.7759,3.016,0.5885,7.4327,3.1377,0.8744,4.9879,4.3808,1.5984,5.3246,1.8783,2.4309,5.2984,3.8987,0.1253,3.759,0.8561,2.8731,2.6256,1.9441,0.113,1.2872,3.3562,1.3438,0.1331,1.4063,4.0569,2.0076,3.5308,0.3996,3.8092,0.7657,3.315,3.9698,0.7194,1.986,6.45,1.1727,2.6811,4.7028,0.3564,2.5098,1.3421,0.487,4.9552,1.7017,0.0054,0.1804,1.844,7.5822,1.5289,1.7627,2.5362,0.0097,0.0261,2.8916,0.5269,5.6948,0.4156,0.6116,3.0831,0.6898,4.541,0.0071,0.6142,2.549,2.8567,3.1544,1.9608,0.156,0.2658,3.5964,0.3557,2.6127,3.5271,0.0008,2.3879,0.1315,2.4799,1.3882,0.5096,5.4307,3.0866,0.1104,0.4899,1.9765,3.5468,0.6267,0.1143,1.2176,1.8995,1.2811,0.4656,1.3834,2.2834,5.5563,3.7617,0.6294,5.5738,1.57,4.7042,2.3661,1.4285,0.38,1.2899,2.2482,4.5288,1.3077,2.4948,4.9527,0.8996,0.6754,2.8167,0.0525,1.5634,2.7913,3.0947,1.5248,2.1213,0.3259,4.6999,1.2926,3.3073,3.6627,0.1826,2.4054,0.1204,1.9168,4.5117,1.14,4.1769,3.9085,3.4694,6.4465,4.7111,4.2214,1.0817,2.9545,3.5211,0.0013,2.3623,3.4105,2.1926,0.5047,0.0358,6.103,2.34,0.4907,1.2534,4.1242,6.69,0.3387,0.4059]}

At lunch your co-workers brag about their new found abilities and realize that you never said anything about yours. When asked, you lie that you don't have any when in reality it is quite terrifying. And you love it. Soon other people start asking you and you realize that you've turned into a world famous liar - even a celebrity.\nWe were talking last week about the concept of being a good teacher, a leader and what it means to become a student. I was struck at the moment that they all involve the same process and as such they are all about learning. So, I started asking a simple question; \"How are the relationships in your family?\" The immediate response was to be \"struggle\" because it is so hard and all too emotional. I said \"well, when a relationship fails we must acknowledge it\". Everyone said that this was something that was taught in school and they couldn't understand why people thought any different. It is a real challenge when you say \"you are not your relationship!\" It is so powerful to think what you can achieve by being your own true self. How I love this process and the powerful results I can experience if I decide that \"I will love myself\". We have been talking about the positive things that can happen when we make the choice to start our conversations as \"I will love myself\" then we can make our way forward in a healthy state of mind.\nThere were some amazing breakthroughs during the week. I was talking with a group last Friday and they described a scenario where they were feeling very disappointed in a person they love. All of a sudden from the depths of their being another person asked \"Have you ever thought what could have been? There is always a solution!\" It was so powerful to hear this and I asked who has to make the choice to make the change. They said \"It's not about you! It is about the people you love\". I was surprised that we thought that we had to take this action but it is truly so powerful. The person in question had made a big decision (to not communicate) and yet that is what started the ball rolling about what could have been. We will never know what might have happened but it is amazing what a simple choice can do and how this is a huge factor in the process of recovery. You may have to make a choice to not be negative but I have been known to do a little bit of negation every now and then!\nAll of us know that we can make choices that can do damage, that there is always time to stop, that we don't have to live by these choices and that we can learn from these experiences. They are all about choices and as such have the power to make or break us but when we make a choice to live in a positive manner they become all about us, our choices and our process of recovering.","token_len":590,"entropy":[6.8149,9.416,3.5271,5.1738,12.2246,1.6865,5.4641,6.1502,7.1091,6.4451,0.0826,0.4548,9.6297,0.0614,0.3128,1.9024,3.968,8.7395,3.9083,1.7039,8.2203,0.9503,1.6837,5.2383,4.6048,2.173,0.8447,5.2534,0.4935,3.6475,6.3179,3.3869,1.4848,5.7078,4.8425,0.356,2.3241,0.0006,1.9635,1.4577,7.8379,4.7691,1.6554,3.2603,1.8158,5.2984,10.1537,0.7043,4.4027,2.2192,6.5753,2.3671,1.6603,6.6808,6.5397,1.1699,2.4593,3.3374,0.8997,5.7895,1.2698,3.9762,0.405,0.8661,3.8439,6.05,1.3751,0.777,6.6017,3.0627,5.5282,6.3888,3.8133,4.2838,4.2486,0.6565,1.6554,7.2642,4.2103,3.7672,5.6077,1.2164,0.8355,1.818,6.5074,0.1264,3.7268,1.5574,3.9381,5.3389,2.0335,3.037,4.9143,1.0322,5.7917,1.097,0.6938,0.1382,4.647,0.4307,6.4554,0.8791,2.1439,2.7077,5.912,4.8727,1.2026,4.9075,1.2483,6.1213,2.9832,10.8176,2.3618,0.7981,5.1388,2.6264,5.6911,2.8463,2.5264,1.8783,2.0165,3.8659,3.8175,1.409,3.4807,2.9509,1.6689,3.4136,3.1573,3.729,5.0321,0.0445,6.1218,1.9682,2.0981,3.9543,4.4683,6.2402,3.6703,0.7852,4.9079,2.5859,3.0457,7.7342,0.6181,0.3915,3.6085,4.7356,4.5576,8.8955,2.6309,2.7945,3.0391,2.5194,1.4564,2.7208,1.7023,3.5389,4.8986,3.9478,7.5517,1.027,1.9798,4.3738,2.0938,3.2659,0.9175,4.6635,4.6351,3.9623,4.5471,4.3159,4.223,7.247,0.5947,2.7297,5.0635,3.5497,2.4667,3.1132,1.9491,4.7672,1.2501,2.4322,5.1549,1.7468,1.2006,1.1017,3.1794,4.7626,0.0004,2.3491,1.6356,2.9224,4.0742,6.9242,3.753,0.4585,3.0875,1.7684,2.4838,4.6956,2.8296,3.7511,0.8566,5.2519,1.5958,2.8606,1.8919,2.1858,4.3833,6.0063,5.1315,2.7493,0.7207,3.209,5.995,2.6574,4.0311,4.9479,1.3287,2.4153,3.2234,2.7763,2.4987,3.489,1.3481,4.9669,0.3422,0.6968,5.086,5.2926,5.8191,2.1103,3.4829,2.6364,3.287,7.0465,5.3256,1.7355,2.7095,5.1487,5.8424,0.1623,6.7671,3.7054,4.8956,1.0009,2.8743,4.0047,2.9149,2.8758,5.1775,2.5014,2.5527,3.2805,0.3184,2.286,5.6481,3.226,1.2515,1.9511,0.4485,1.2644,1.5587,4.5448,1.8409,2.8056,0.4223,5.0254,3.2371,8.1461,4.8296,4.4292,2.0034,0.7967,0.2294,0.1015,1.3607,6.1778,1.8021,1.5995,3.7849,2.946,3.6906,4.6739,2.9347,2.5196,3.3167,7.0872,0.824,2.1542,0.5967,0.9816,4.6065,3.6808,2.5025,4.9642,8.2805,0.1972,4.7204,1.4245,4.8014,1.3131,1.6199,2.2425,3.9764,2.4614,1.4542,3.402,8.778,3.9023,1.7741,1.784,6.3632,1.8272,5.6347,0.8845,1.3044,1.7575,6.3311,3.2571,6.7553,2.5727,3.8098,3.372,1.8869,3.6183,0.8547,5.6962,1.209,1.0304,0.0004,7.5548,1.4017,5.2571,0.0492,0.8113,5.275,8.4737,0.5178,4.4378,2.4176,5.4548,0.1137,0.4624,3.0872,5.8087,4.4648,2.5699,1.2474,3.3866,5.5044,0.9151,3.8722,1.9438,5.0864,3.3735,3.38,0.8943,2.5499,3.3858,1.4512,2.561,1.9825,1.7718,2.1092,4.4239,5.4527,5.4699,4.4605,3.5654,0.9434,1.4806,1.6267,2.387,0.9458,3.3879,0.939,1.69,1.3927,1.3972,5.0173,2.0039,2.2172,2.9789,2.3594,3.9284,0.6906,1.5306,0.3309,2.0465,2.6501,1.4213,0.2872,2.3708,1.6586,2.3278,3.4547,1.9979,4.8978,4.6163,1.8654,3.2952,2.2148,2.1808,4.3024,1.955,4.8873,3.2316,2.0555,2.0117,4.7465,4.1074,1.2468,1.0695,2.7989,3.6159,2.8673,1.3692,3.0328,4.5485,1.4199,3.2633,1.2206,5.8538,4.0057,4.4232,7.4739,2.1784,0.653,5.4255,4.6845,2.7282,1.1619,6.3626,1.1982,10.3757,0.0023,7.2651,2.6548,2.1954,0.8197,0.6757,0.3477,2.975,4.796,1.9435,1.0149,1.7634,4.0588,0.1717,0.6945,2.3634,1.8438,0.7242,3.7999,3.1242,3.1696,5.7762,3.7347,0.3735,1.0205,3.3086,2.0316,4.2061,3.4624,2.5935,3.8912,4.9837,0.4983,2.025,3.4211,1.2047,5.1277,0.2875,4.6938,3.1777,1.8137,2.5514,3.3244,1.2443,2.0598,1.7583,3.3203,2.59,7.5124,2.3888,3.0184,3.6102,2.6774,6.5556,0.1006,3.4819,4.2984,3.1984,1.0044,0.134,9.2612,0.1365,5.3192,1.653,0.0028,0.2101,6.1874,1.0656,5.1064,0.8778,3.7648,3.8905,0.3937,2.4309,2.2498,2.5029,3.6691,2.3479,3.0717,4.9853,6.1468,2.8541,3.6441,6.025,0.7563,1.5184,5.8932,0.6085,5.3943,2.5695,1.0907,1.5442,4.2486,0.0007,1.0015,0.3868,5.0078,4.0239,3.9326,2.007,1.6905,0.8573,1.0436,1.0563,3.1105,0.7464,3.5906,2.449,0.5941,6.0869,0.9514,2.1007,2.1029,5.9439,1.0379,5.2699,0.4898,4.2734,2.9145,0.4937,0.0343,2.702,4.9849,0.0616,1.3976,5.3886,4.1564,0.8868,1.5307,1.9115,0.6235,2.6957,3.3004,3.0699,0.8268,2.3728,3.9294,4.1701,3.3571,5.2102,0.7044,4.0304,3.2179,3.0495,2.9686,0.6134,1.2599,6.6138,1.7952,5.9827,0.3317]}
{"prompt":"You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago , today he gives it back and says , `` I need a favor '' .","text":"You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago, today he gives it back and says, `` I need a favor ''. You decide which one you want. I hope you don't make the same mistake with me.\nWhen you think of your life, I dont believe that it's important that you have all I do, but that you have me, i'll always be there for you!\nAnd my friend you have the best heart.. a smile is enough to help you through the hardest days.. a hug can make a lot of problems come to an end.. and even the love of a good friend can make all you want to do, you know what the best part?.. it all begins in your heart..\nI know we are very far away. I dont see you in person often, but I can tell you are happy. I'm happy that you are happy. You're the best friend in the world for me. May your new years be filled with happiness!!!\nI have had a wonderful time visiting your blog these days. I hope we can continue to read and share from time to time. I am glad you enjoyed my post as much as you were happy to read it. Thanks for being around.\nOh my! I just found out that you and my friend are friends from the same time-space continuum. OMG. I'm soo jealous. I'm such a romantic, love to dream and be told I think I need to see you a bit more. I'm pretty sure you have to be real pretty for me to have the interest and imagination. And being in the right place at the right time and sharing the same interests is also a plus. I feel happy so many times that just a little kiss here or there on the cheek would do.\nI have missed you, sweet girl. I hope you are living the life you had in mind. Wishing you all of the best in the coming year.\nI had to look it up for the word. And your description of me is spot on! I can't imagine being without you.\nMerry Christmas and Merry Happy New year to you! :) ) It is so good to see you around - not you but your blog!

{"prompt":"Hermione Granger accidentaly breaks the time-turner and travels back into ancient Rome , where she uses her vast knowledge and magical powers to become empress of the roman empire .","text":"Hermione Granger accidentaly breaks the time-turner and travels back into ancient Rome, where she uses her vast knowledge and magical powers to become empress of the roman empire. she is the only one who can stop the army of Drakonus, a race that is determined to destroy all magic. she must work with both the Roman army and Greek army to defeat this race in a battle that leaves both countries destroyed for time.\nThis movie is awesome. it has action, adventure, romance, and is very silly. There is an evil witch named Bellatrix Lestrange whom Hermione has to fight. she is very angry because of some dark things that happened to a wizard named Harry Potter. It is a very dramatic story. The ending was very emotional, because it was the end of a book, but it does not show up in the movie. the movie was also a bit scarier, because it shows you what is coming at the end.\nit is about a girl named Hermione Granger who is smart, funny, and strong. she is in a magic school and also in a wizarding world, where a small wizards team called quidditch plays. they live in a hut with many other wizards. It is in an ancient witch town called Hogsmeade. The story begins when she meets a wizard named Harry Potter, who is a total newcomer in this school, but she feels really bad for the boy and she gives him lots of help.\nI think the book is better than the movie. it has lots of interesting things in it, and it has an amazing ending. The movie is great, but if you compare the book and the movie, you get a little bit of different things in each one. The movie has a lot of scary things, which I wasn't expecting. But the book is really good.\nWhen I first saw Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone I was very curious because I know that there are many great things about this book and if I read a good book it can be very exciting. I read this book over the weekend and I am very happy to review it. I love books from JK Rowling because she has fantastic storytelling and it makes me want to read more.\nI think the most significant thing about the book is the fantastic writing. it was very creative and the story seemed to have many ideas. I was also very impressed with how the storytelling was. there was no boring dialogue and it was very interesting. I was also impressed with the writing style because there are some very interesting things here and there.\nI know that this is probably not the most popular movie of all time, but my opinion is that it is. I really like the movie, it seems very funny and the characters are very interesting and you can get more info if you watch the TV show, or read the book. I really recommend it to anyone who is interested.","token_len":591,"entropy":[7.2423,2.487,13.8502,9.3276,9.3788,1.6721,6.3898,3.0411,5.0211,0.8169,2.4529,6.046,1.2593,2.9428,7.4374,2.4997,1.9394,1.2206,0.5154,6.2546,1.1223,7.0932,1.0067,2.4748,3.0987,1.0197,0.1042,4.863,10.3904,1.6786,0.5442,1.1505,8.2832,1.7817,1.4224,0.7061,8.999,2.1304,3.527,2.1946,1.9883,1.3781,1.2562,2.5883,1.2556,7.3534,0.9339,8.4441,1.8451,0.9558,4.869,1.7131,2.6823,3.6515,3.0637,2.2482,4.7756,0.0565,1.819,2.0236,5.5134,1.9621,3.0311,3.7096,4.5827,1.7263,4.2267,1.6742,5.2033,3.0175,0.1219,8.5575,3.7397,0.3202,1.4894,3.3806,3.2484,3.7159,1.9575,1.9805,1.4319,6.0043,3.4015,4.3523,5.7843,5.1272,7.8936,0.4401,1.9091,7.7359,4.7883,0.8801,6.5916,1.0489,4.5435,2.1909,6.2279,0.9307,3.8857,0.4519,3.5005,0.4038,1.4994,4.705,3.126,7.229,0.6647,5.3489,0.958,3.4938,4.3903,4.4381,2.6647,6.4087,1.2021,0.0006,2.5894,0.0793,0.0464,6.4369,3.7305,2.2079,2.6034,2.6086,2.5344,2.8725,1.2687,3.2901,4.7143,3.6074,2.2229,5.1948,5.5749,3.1087,1.507,1.1567,0.7508,5.4269,4.3443,2.9393,3.6593,2.3143,1.0256,4.9856,0.9668,1.9688,1.887,7.2941,2.8716,1.6976,2.6203,3.5956,3.1062,1.8367,4.0409,2.0786,3.6201,1.5209,1.3975,2.63,1.921,0.2023,1.8973,4.9136,2.3378,1.6638,1.1121,4.3344,1.3989,4.9813,2.7966,0.6366,0.5655,1.0746,0.5102,3.3783,1.5616,2.3692,3.9423,2.5113,2.679,9.504,0.0287,2.3134,0.6851,1.2603,4.3904,4.8457,2.8656,2.853,5.4211,4.6261,3.4658,0.1754,1.8761,2.1659,6.9012,1.1877,4.432,1.7153,2.4834,1.3724,1.724,2.1681,0.7807,1.5576,8.0394,1.1622,3.9843,0.155,0.7929,4.1271,0.6312,1.1346,0.8858,4.4517,2.0059,5.9242,1.5443,1.7187,5.8251,2.9599,0.7797,3.4629,0.6136,2.1942,2.0203,2.6173,4.4759,5.3164,8.969,5.0017,5.469,8.8618,0.4384,0.0067,5.8682,1.9224,3.138,6.9438,0.7057,0.6261,6.6537,2.2832,4.6148,2.8834,1.2115,1.4856,6.3873,0.4787,4.0666,3.5546,2.4477,5.3971,4.0693,1.2329,4.7918,1.0593,0.0014,0.0009,1.6235,2.9836,3.6116,2.8169,1.5803,3.0426,1.5728,1.0387,2.8397,0.3133,2.7847,0.7579,1.6565,0.5792,1.0462,2.0151,7.134,6.1566,3.6526,2.4517,2.5302,2.1153,1.9659,2.2335,6.0293,5.243,3.4553,1.5179,3.2073,2.8443,1.945,3.2452,5.0226,0.2196,6.4366,0.0315,3.2194,0.785,3.074,4.4427,2.8196,1.9323,4.8553,1.1383,4.1412,1.2116,0.6181,0.1935,0.9733,1.6925,1.6073,3.7233,0.0378,3.7319,2.6934,3.1405,0.0943,1.3135,1.8369,1.3951,1.7085,3.4372,2.5507,1.5351,0.4076,2.947,1.5505,1.238,3.9252,1.4589,1.222,4.3128,0.3443,7.2583,1.2953,2.6865,2.5602,0.5618,0.0814,0.9302,1.6468,3.2142,1.5825,2.9611,1.4907,0.6179,4.0361,1.1426,2.5752,4.5168,1.8475,0.196,2.1683,0.8744,1.4073,1.1574,0.9027,0.4138,6.7002,1.1771,1.363,3.1793,1.9385,6.3978,0.0012,0.7828,0.8077,4.0491,1.3809,1.8003,1.257,3.0388,1.2277,1.1331,1.8724,5.2631,1.4463,2.1098,1.4361,4.0271,0.0468,2.9631,0.2118,2.0919,0.0121,0.006,9.3994,2.034,1.0208,2.415,4.7269,4.3619,1.1086,4.9032,1.1574,2.4722,0.9385,1.7069,4.3687,2.1448,1.4766,1.2655,0.8431,2.7803,6.1087,1.4845,2.4708,3.8026,3.3307,0.3177,3.0106,3.0325,1.5064,1.6699,4.0222,0.6226,1.3405,2.893,2.8359,0.3067,6.2336,2.8111,3.167,0.7036,1.0741,2.712,1.3045,2.0755,2.6144,6.4456,0.2485,0.3865,1.114,3.0009,4.5948,6.0252,5.5058,2.4793,0.0026,4.4694,3.2288,1.3553,6.7115,5.33,1.0707,3.1427,2.7209,1.1616,1.3209,0.0532,0.3908,0.464,0.9606,1.514,1.607,2.8762,1.1867,5.2433,5.7761,0.5774,0.6457,1.6646,0.5604,0.1898,1.59,6.7449,3.1636,0.6484,2.8095,3.2925,1.9568,5.8962,0.8978,3.3859,2.193,6.4611,1.1025,2.6384,3.5745,5.0449,0.8906,1.2985,3.4101,3.4863,1.052,1.6642,0.563,1.8054,1.5774,7.629,1.5044,3.8138,2.8855,1.7105,2.1496,5.9758,3.2719,2.1083,2.3262,0.9841,0.9944,2.8455,0.8279,1.5356,2.7197,1.6667,2.0435,0.5721,1.0442,2.8023,3.0607,3.2749,2.6324,2.2815,2.7929,2.0807,2.0137,1.7888,4.9371,2.5352,0.8261,0.5483,1.4519,1.3596,4.9489,0.7033,2.3117,1.19,4.406,2.5344,1.003,1.5502,1.6405,1.9969,1.262,0.9865,0.0346,0.6811,0.2078,5.2597,2.745,0.4616,0.1468,0.989,0.456,4.0874,1.2812,3.7092,1.3297,1.3597,2.1584,2.1204,2.2774,5.1331,2.348,3.8668,1.1155,3.0681,2.2607,0.6406,1.1853,1.6177,1.7559,4.8891,1.3085,3.565,4.5312,6.6181,4.6037,0.0277,2.6855,0.754,6.7897,0.6009,2.8225,3.1054,1.7664,0.5841,1.3857,0.4309,1.2286,2.7636,3.2838,1.5993,1.724,0.9334,0.7011,1.374,1.2294,2.8754]}

{"prompt":"Why was 6 afraid of 7 ?","text":"Why was 6 afraid of 7? How did you get so far away from the house? 8 wasn\u2019t he afraid of getting left behind? How did you manage so well? You are an amazing little fellow, don\u2019t lose your sense of adventure!\nI love the way you answer my questions. Sometimes if he gets into a bad mood my questions have to be a bit different, eg.\u201dHow are you feeling?\u201d \u201cHow are you going today? \u201c\nAt first it was hard to get them to be ready, but as soon as he became confident in talking back, he spoke like this in French.\nHere is the story that I read and explained to him ( you see he learned all these things in English before he went to bed and this morning he came to me and asked me in French for the story, so I had to get him to memorise it).\nThis is the story of how little lamb came out and asked what to do to go home. His mum didn\u2019t know.\nThis is the story of how the cat answered : \u2013 No, but we could get the fire going.\nThis is the story of how the lamb said : \u2013 No, there is no fire anywhere.\nThis is the story of how the little lamb turned tail.\nThis is the story of how fire came creeping up in the dark with the little lambs, and the big cat came out and scared it away \u2013 by saying (in French) \u201c no, no, please, not you, it is too early in the morning to have any fire \u2026.. \u201d\nWell, as ever, you have so much that you have achieved. You know so much that even the big cats are afraid of you, and you know so much!!\nThis is how you are going to continue talking to the others in french. For the next few days you will be working on the conversation parts at home.\nWhat a wonderful young man you are, my son! My God! He knows so much about the world, and he can speak so beautifully. As the parents say : \u201c Wow!\nI love to look at you as you go through a new language, one that isn\u2019t your own. Your joy is always there and your interest in everything around you is always fresh. And, I think you will continue in the same way in french. You are going to continue to progress very quickly, I am sure of it.\nYou have made so much progress so far, I am so proud of you and of your mum. I know the language can be hard, the culture challenging sometimes.\nAt one time I wondered if I had made the right decision to teach you french, after all, you are not a french speaking child and you are not french as far as language goes. But I am so glad I decided on the other way round.","token_len":595,"entropy":[4.8174,9.7712,11.9748,1.0809,5.9547,1.6791,4.4201,1.3191,1.8597,2.4457,2.8154,2.721,3.3794,0.4177,2.5512,5.978,1.4667,4.6909,8.4192,16.0543,9.4405,1.7885,3.1258,3.406,0.5171,5.927,6.7809,0.9826,0.8276,4.3309,0.6958,0.4177,4.1097,6.1141,2.288,1.5599,5.2108,3.2322,4.4311,2.3535,5.3612,5.4453,2.0163,4.2616,1.3099,0.3861,0.0309,6.3856,1.3524,3.6656,0.0473,5.351,2.7778,2.8406,6.0833,4.6372,3.7761,2.3966,0.4426,6.9797,3.4751,0.0818,0.9615,6.0666,6.2764,6.1604,4.0512,4.5674,1.8216,3.1137,1.6358,6.8526,3.9611,4.8368,1.1315,0.3882,5.7292,1.5971,4.395,2.3517,8.8495,1.1697,6.5919,8.1817,7.1481,3.0619,0.1895,0.9301,1.1919,1.4588,1.69,6.8809,4.9262,3.2146,0.8923,0.1005,4.5567,6.5953,0.195,3.6472,1.4658,8.2947,6.3585,2.5544,2.6999,0.8648,2.9023,0.8982,2.7591,6.0087,0.4449,5.023,5.5645,1.7485,0.5448,3.9211,2.8148,0.0375,2.6514,4.3702,5.0832,2.1685,6.2591,6.2925,1.8611,1.4016,6.852,4.327,3.4888,5.0775,7.0949,0.9548,2.5129,6.0571,1.2782,1.4591,3.7309,4.1616,1.8805,4.4541,3.8963,6.3932,1.1298,0.481,4.6284,8.9882,4.3387,3.0665,6.4754,4.2423,3.1147,1.0135,2.461,3.145,3.5633,1.1501,3.339,0.3357,5.4151,3.2592,4.6964,7.4727,1.646,4.5543,1.6896,1.0862,1.4068,2.562,0.7298,5.5982,0.6216,3.6566,2.4939,3.9025,2.8338,2.3007,0.7137,3.8075,0.4466,4.7649,1.7284,0.4419,6.7947,3.0847,0.9449,2.1091,0.592,3.9918,1.0461,1.5292,0.7717,1.1699,1.3306,7.0257,11.64,3.4537,2.871,3.7588,5.9928,4.0565,3.3967,0.4991,3.1665,5.1261,2.0446,1.015,5.1171,4.7994,4.28,1.8086,0.7875,0.0041,1.6161,3.3299,1.8794,3.4666,0.6149,0.8355,0.139,0.2323,0.3498,2.6668,5.0423,8.3509,9.0132,7.9167,6.0983,0.9424,4.3347,3.6483,3.987,3.5199,2.706,8.1522,2.6067,1.7323,1.5572,2.3944,0.0748,0.1704,0.0719,0.0692,0.2393,1.3737,4.0311,3.8952,0.8375,0.6813,2.308,0.3363,5.4157,1.0333,0.7819,1.3939,6.7763,1.0614,0.4658,0.787,0.0279,0.0435,0.0329,0.0116,0.1153,0.4103,5.1235,0.2358,5.3017,7.7871,2.3243,0.7475,0.6655,0.0397,0.0425,0.0385,0.0216,0.152,8.868,2.1196,9.5601,0.9395,3.7,0.7976,4.9226,4.9895,1.3723,2.7956,5.4785,0.2798,3.3437,1.796,2.4392,4.6579,2.9453,3.4062,1.7145,1.9339,5.062,2.9577,2.503,6.9628,5.2382,3.7484,5.6326,3.2683,0.1983,0.6945,2.6041,2.279,6.2823,0.6438,2.3376,0.6128,4.9056,1.5009,4.9164,4.7766,1.4132,2.7462,1.1043,3.3214,3.5034,4.1645,0.0679,0.5421,2.215,4.7876,1.9677,2.1447,5.4139,6.4418,3.9021,2.8828,1.1881,5.3622,0.8142,4.7932,8.1794,0.6439,2.6557,2.4317,6.4723,0.5755,5.8224,0.6111,2.5124,9.0955,1.6435,2.7864,4.023,6.7794,0.6027,2.4164,5.6103,2.2371,4.3554,0.9424,2.8877,1.5938,0.4967,0.834,1.6487,1.6693,1.4881,1.861,0.7265,0.1367,10.8513,0.9184,2.607,0.1677,2.4389,1.6901,3.0645,2.696,0.3351,5.1702,6.1654,1.1848,2.5376,7.1243,3.4427,6.8094,1.3019,5.5644,2.1196,1.0557,1.1052,0.7296,1.1746,0.4597,1.4056,4.3741,1.0738,1.9178,5.8335,8.0748,5.8099,1.0435,1.1059,1.0726,4.4332,4.887,1.703,4.989,0.6973,1.4648,0.0939,1.5376,4.6319,3.9491,1.8211,5.5123,3.3547,2.0506,4.3058,4.0215,0.986,0.0889,2.3546,2.4794,1.7929,1.3114,1.2528,1.515,3.292,2.6626,1.4764,4.8915,1.6641,5.5364,3.7148,6.5032,4.0165,2.8723,1.6394,2.3389,9.1407,1.8973,3.8848,2.287,2.0213,3.5907,5.7422,0.3832,1.7419,3.4047,1.9852,3.4346,1.2952,3.5794,4.034,6.8566,1.3655,5.8966,0.5669,5.2196,0.9928,0.4744,0.168,5.2705,1.9385,1.2981,4.6201,8.1568,1.2553,4.5245,1.8131,2.9591,2.9237,7.9166,2.9196,4.867,5.461,0.0211,0.6329,0.6736,5.3485,0.7689,3.4224,4.0087,2.7054,2.872,2.171,2.4744,4.8571,5.3019,2.3492,1.0207,0.3388,4.3336,4.8629,1.3771,3.202,1.4682,2.6691,0.0286,1.5576,0.7418,6.4952,4.8256,2.2634,1.1012,3.7434,2.4084,0.3296,3.9556,0.5215,0.4438,0.782,2.7444,2.3938,3.498,1.8742,0.6273,0.749,4.1066,0.1722,1.1339,2.0752,1.4612,2.4364,2.216,0.4306,0.1056,2.8824,3.084,1.5363,6.7336,0.7824,1.6088,3.0583,4.025,5.0856,5.4394,0.6965,2.3975,1.5235,5.2535,6.5065,6.3683,4.654,2.2018,3.3927,5.6217,4.7422,1.7566,1.4187,5.8301,0.931,1.5816,2.9938,2.5666,2.6629,0.5434,1.0214,3.0208,4.9335,1.2533,4.0286,1.5328,5.388,0.7166,1.1143,1.524,1.2982,3.054,1.8832,4.2547,4.2857,1.3456,2.6466,1.303,1.6768,1.0539,6.3521,7.788,4.1144,0.0099,6.4949,1.3738,0.3614,1.9715,1.6846,2.4235,2.2769,1.2911,2.1022,3.9025,3.5474,2.4739,6.0665,2.175,4.4463,0.7005]}
{"prompt":"A child summons a demon to do their homework for them .","text":"A child summons a demon to do their homework for them. We are the demon of humanity, the child of man (Galatians 3:16). In the time of Jonah, it took the prophet four days to go three miles. That means at least one day at home to complete his assignment. But we are always running to some place or the other. If it cannot be finished that day, it will be finished the next day or some days. We feel obligated to do that; it is a condition of our salvation.\nBut don\u2019t go beyond the capacity you have.

Why do it? The Lord is just going to kill us if we don\u2019t do it. God is saying, \u201cWhen you have finished your assignment, come and say, \u2018God, thank you for the assignment.

{"prompt":"SatChat : What books from your childhood still have an effect on you today ?","text":"SatChat : What books from your childhood still have an effect on you today? And what are your favourite books?\nDr Dhiraj Chatterjee : I read a lot of British literature for a while. After reading The Odyssey, the Odyssey is the first book that is a bit like a novel of course.\nAfter that I think the Odyssey and The Greek Tragedies are the most influencial. Odyssey is a classic, I always have liked it. The Odyssey is like a novel, almost like a novel, about people who are away from home, are wandering, and have to overcome all difficult situations on the way back. So I always like a good adventure, and the Odyssey also has a lot of adventures and so far is one of the greatest adventures in literature.\nAnd also The Greek Tragedies, the Trojan War or the Iliad with The Odyssey is really the golden standard of ancient Greek literature. It is also an amazing history and drama, the way they used the ancient history and they used the ancient drama \u2013 I always like these things, I like history. There are many such ancient books in Europe.\nSome of them I want to read in German language, because I did not read it originally or in my mother tongue \u2013 I can read it very well in English, though.\nBut I want to read in German languages, some literature of antiquity. And then I am interested very much in history and in general human history, because I think it is important that we understand both the past and the future. I always feel a kind of responsibility for what is happening in the world today \u2013 there are all kinds of conflicts and all kinds of challenges and many problems \u2013 we don\u2019t understand what is happening at all, and why do we have all these problems? And all of these problems are not just problems of people in India. When I see history, all these people lived together \u2013 they are still here, and they do their job, and they are still trying to struggle, and still trying to solve the problems that they have, and the problems we have, and they are also trying to live their lives, and to give meaning to their lives.\nIt was a very strong point of literature as well, that literature actually tries to give us such a picture of this world and this human nature, and the way different cultures live together, the struggle in the world, the things that make human life interesting, the questions, the problems, and the struggle for meaning.\nBut also I am interested in modern day literature. Because literature is always trying to give you the message in your language which is your country\u2019s language, but also it is trying to give you new ideas that are maybe not quite in line with the culture of your language, although that might be quite a nice thing. Modern day literature is also really interesting for me, as it is being done in English, in German language.","token_len":596,"entropy":[11.5031,6.7244,5.033,10.6728,7.0785,2.7222,4.7537,7.2902,2.5229,2.7103,3.8877,0.1769,0.4113,2.779,0.3748,5.1556,1.3234,2.1885,1.1896,2.7322,0.9269,1.6343,0.7844,11.6695,9.7121,3.3763,3.3359,4.9355,2.222,0.0229,0.44,1.4221,2.7425,1.913,0.2319,0.228,6.6505,1.5689,4.7675,2.1144,1.7667,1.2272,5.2923,2.5177,3.1793,5.3949,1.0478,3.7318,5.0113,2.7878,2.5731,2.1823,0.9103,2.3297,4.7764,3.2372,2.5239,3.4094,1.7486,3.2963,4.2835,6.0793,0.7558,3.3799,7.1451,3.0638,1.5227,4.847,2.9391,5.6954,4.1227,1.7903,7.1284,5.8594,0.0244,3.1598,1.5554,1.9008,2.2548,11.7851,0.888,0.4317,2.1467,8.4005,0.8726,1.6249,4.0195,2.3912,3.6187,4.5638,4.016,3.7125,0.8647,0.6563,2.148,2.1296,0.7336,4.0387,0.7618,2.6225,2.6154,5.6675,1.0802,0.4446,2.1085,2.2403,4.476,4.3452,1.5714,1.5809,7.8384,0.4501,0.4541,1.6692,4.8286,6.6229,2.4756,1.845,2.6244,3.1525,5.6002,3.9933,7.8654,1.8225,5.4499,2.3875,1.8,2.6599,1.6642,4.3037,1.5115,2.6132,2.3239,4.0954,3.0536,5.5443,1.9964,2.3694,2.9986,0.9915,5.1764,1.2525,1.0219,1.7078,0.1923,4.9707,3.0875,5.1015,4.7646,4.5188,2.8203,0.1928,0.8915,4.2092,2.595,2.3491,4.065,0.4367,0.5816,4.1203,3.8873,2.2868,4.2462,0.1895,0.0016,0.0083,2.1284,3.0373,7.6278,0.4053,5.421,1.7111,7.1745,0.1435,0.0078,5.5183,5.0671,1.6858,2.0215,4.0014,2.6312,6.9957,5.0471,1.3894,6.7225,1.1546,0.6097,0.4446,2.1179,1.1668,3.538,3.7809,3.0152,5.2142,2.5044,5.0804,1.6337,3.3076,4.7701,3.8279,3.9555,2.4338,4.713,3.2889,2.0111,4.3504,1.7323,1.1072,3.6841,1.5009,7.114,3.4839,3.0763,1.5176,3.8528,3.1338,1.9183,2.42,2.1054,5.773,1.8064,4.8732,0.8027,2.1898,5.0853,4.474,3.0022,1.9588,6.0514,1.4603,0.9506,5.8957,0.5715,0.8624,2.5681,5.0941,0.0567,1.4477,3.2924,6.2191,6.3158,1.4737,3.4876,1.0983,6.1758,0.7185,2.0227,2.6112,7.58,4.947,2.2822,3.8249,5.6595,0.0707,4.3179,1.2949,4.5559,0.8858,1.4345,4.7696,0.8308,1.3085,1.873,1.6845,5.9214,1.9871,0.9598,3.6932,1.3223,2.9726,0.1312,0.7067,2.4605,1.0564,5.5132,1.2848,6.1216,7.1982,3.1892,6.2202,1.5995,3.0149,3.8174,0.7353,3.4006,2.9757,7.3232,0.1195,0.2692,3.6526,1.6304,3.5725,6.9001,5.8796,1.0503,1.3776,2.7164,1.1404,2.6228,1.7576,0.3716,2.6333,2.4885,1.0799,2.1363,5.4179,1.2575,2.4173,0.1175,0.2001,0.4321,0.9617,2.3878,3.5661,4.6579,3.7142,4.369,0.003,5.2142,2.1629,3.719,2.2559,0.67,0.9879,1.0022,0.5108,1.8224,3.6434,4.6906,1.0528,4.6076,0.8535,0.0034,4.2817,1.3363,3.1698,0.2224,0.0005,5.0509,1.7679,5.2921,3.5619,3.6476,3.4276,3.6967,15.8972,7.807,0.6199,1.73,2.3951,0.6573,0.388,4.2426,2.6932,1.9341,1.9979,5.6593,4.5238,0.3881,1.5312,2.9508,0.6047,0.9874,1.4341,2.347,5.4409,1.5901,1.468,1.268,0.8851,3.5184,2.4526,3.8346,0.7873,3.297,3.4564,6.155,1.7523,5.6884,1.3282,4.2969,4.5679,1.1977,4.4566,1.8507,3.1186,6.8147,3.2382,4.1701,1.981,2.7458,4.9405,3.7187,1.3622,1.9313,1.1774,3.9399,3.8196,3.257,1.8657,1.1069,0.9688,1.6826,2.7726,4.1591,0.1816,8.6507,2.1688,0.8539,5.4935,2.3848,0.0341,3.8738,2.66,0.2014,1.9431,1.5653,1.268,2.33,0.8128,3.7032,1.7971,4.5461,0.716,2.6286,0.9805,2.8642,0.9171,4.2215,1.513,0.055,3.4621,2.3245,0.3096,2.1515,0.7711,2.8618,4.7794,4.2332,0.2035,1.0767,0.2206,0.7521,0.7248,4.03,3.1289,1.9973,1.606,5.2646,5.0914,0.9657,6.1964,4.3046,1.4987,1.2301,2.3339,4.8296,7.3884,6.925,0.0872,3.6312,3.2373,6.659,1.1492,4.832,0.5777,4.6958,0.9166,2.0777,2.3388,4.0331,4.4164,1.2778,0.8985,3.3231,2.1897,7.2902,1.8427,1.8276,0.9943,1.2866,3.6683,7.5457,3.9384,1.7838,0.526,0.8505,1.6325,5.1277,0.3489,4.9831,5.7116,0.8553,2.7555,1.0295,2.0212,6.7442,3.3663,0.6705,2.3692,1.2782,1.438,1.1504,5.4725,2.349,2.6189,0.9904,1.1567,3.3415,3.4718,2.1758,2.851,0.9974,0.3419,5.4812,4.8141,1.6383,1.7116,4.5047,4.456,0.7657,4.3227,2.7694,0.0435,1.7501,3.7714,2.6164,5.3782,4.3187,2.3343,4.46,5.1742,0.7105,5.8455,5.4949,6.087,0.3001,4.5539,2.953,0.9033,3.362,0.9034,3.139,0.9499,1.5309,0.0266,0.9419,0.112,6.4522,1.7657,3.1338,1.5775,7.2429,1.0898,3.0748,2.9538,4.6666,0.0408,1.5708,4.438,1.6176,0.4276,5.8538,0.983,6.8666,3.2267,2.3321,0.4562,4.9705,3.4701,3.9519,2.0109,1.0741,8.3869,1.1806,0.3226,0.8567,3.0141,4.0846,2.2459,2.717,0.4891,1.6462,3.6977,1.825,1.1648,5.404,5.2216,1.0585,3.9911,1.1297,2.2798,1.149,3.5206,1.7829]}
{"prompt":"You are an `` auditor '' , a person who goes around and observes alien scientific and cultural growth across the galaxy .

One day at work, you become increasingly concerned with these up and coming `` Humans '' and their erratic growth. You need your thoughts and observations translated into a language humans can understand and are in danger of losing control of your own mind and the human population of the planet! Help this person through the dangerous missions with a carefully planned route and a number of tricks of the trade!! Playable on NES ( console )!\nPlay the new top-down version of the infamous arcade classic! Your main character, a man, is stuck on a top-down space ship, while attempting to destroy it. There are two orbs at the centre, representing the light of his planet and his home from which he must destroy them before the ship will be destroyed. But beware, there is a beam that you can walk into which will send you crashing down into the core of the ship. To destroy the orb you must hit the other and bounce to it.\nThe second game in the original game series! You have a very long journey ahead of you when you come back to the world again!! The adventure has started long ago, but you have to find and rescue the two lost children who have left home to discover how they can fight back against the evil creatures that live there. This dark world of the forest now features lots of challenging puzzles, many levels to be explored, creatures to exterminate, and many more features! Playable on NES ( console )!\nThe adventurers of the game have been rescued from the ice - locked prison where they had been stuck since the game began. Now, it is you who are trapped within the ice! Can you make it out to the top of the rock pyramid, where your friends are, before too much time passes? The objective is to avoid the deadly boulders and be able to make it to the top. Can you reach the top and escape from this ice prison?\nOne more in the arcade series of Space Invaders! As usual, we have to try and destroy all the invading spaceships. We have three upgrades, and, you can equip other enemies in your arsenal. You can also use some special weapons, like the grenades, or lasers etc.\nThis game is still being developed as the second part of this famous arcade game! However, it is now a little different. You can choose from three separate games, in which you can either take control of one of your best friends, or take control of an alien being. As usual, when you jump, your movement is restricted as it has to be adjusted in time, or else you will crash. Another addition to the game are the aliens that you have to deal with, who have been given special attacks, like teleporting, firing a laser or jumping and dodging etc.. There are six stages to be completed before you have reached the final goal!","token_len":596,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,12.3166,13.7933,4.2286,2.9186,2.5521,2.2227,0.7006,8.3564,4.9787,2.71,6.3912,12.0322,8.6704,2.6468,3.6104,9.004,6.891,0.6085,5.4391,1.2212,6.257,3.0909,5.1947,4.4411,0.9217,0.8877,4.79,6.736,2.3122,1.7074,5.5188,9.6555,3.2448,0.1292,7.0717,13.2197,4.1852,2.4555,4.9939,9.3019,6.0705,0.9794,1.8151,4.5857,4.46,7.3847,1.088,3.3844,7.4784,0.2359,2.736,4.9234,9.3137,0.6715,0.5,1.5364,5.5701,5.8865,5.2446,0.0451,2.1262,4.3073,0.2553,5.9774,1.9689,2.051,2.151,4.097,4.7374,6.0566,4.1134,1.0477,2.857,5.7825,6.9355,4.3218,4.1536,4.5443,1.5223,6.1052,6.767,3.8535,2.2613,7.6734,3.5238,6.7707,2.2973,1.7688,6.0024,0.0097,6.0946,4.6774,0.3997,0.0209,7.1289,8.6899,8.2919,3.5004,7.1262,3.9878,10.4532,0.5547,6.4655,1.7809,8.5471,3.8343,5.5936,9.2358,1.2783,0.1006,4.4194,0.4656,1.3252,8.1829,5.5249,2.7198,3.6516,5.7587,4.3272,1.9908,1.8713,3.0033,3.6765,3.2489,1.5478,4.8426,1.5628,0.6289,6.4404,0.4698,0.047,3.7175,2.3939,1.858,4.1983,5.8367,0.1029,4.7327,2.5245,0.7618,4.8547,0.9478,2.7568,10.101,4.0379,0.5304,4.8126,2.8799,6.5289,1.2728,6.5515,1.9395,4.0774,4.4929,1.7564,2.2057,4.06,7.1854,2.3911,0.52,3.8016,5.0306,2.5097,3.8652,2.031,1.855,3.6081,2.2284,0.69,0.5716,5.5411,4.4366,1.1792,2.9835,1.3898,1.0194,7.6091,2.2833,4.4659,0.7787,6.9087,2.162,3.1686,1.0741,3.2409,0.4955,3.9599,1.5065,1.4911,0.57,6.5474,0.3885,0.2016,0.5111,1.0159,4.7741,4.1893,1.0952,2.5643,1.944,0.9615,4.0567,1.106,5.5788,5.9229,6.2338,4.391,3.8887,0.9939,3.5143,2.1241,4.7923,5.0274,1.482,0.294,3.7652,3.7765,3.8408,5.3392,3.1187,2.8784,2.4427,4.3899,4.4028,2.9919,2.1685,0.3235,0.0106,3.8168,0.3308,3.569,5.8506,0.8405,1.6573,4.3948,7.4057,5.5089,2.4629,5.4219,3.9127,4.2558,6.335,1.1472,1.3306,1.3344,1.2789,1.6229,2.5098,2.6456,3.6117,2.9005,1.0868,3.7456,4.2633,4.346,2.2068,1.8498,3.564,3.8109,2.1537,4.8221,3.9966,1.6091,2.6753,6.5463,0.9681,1.1952,0.6792,2.208,5.1965,1.6574,3.7298,2.2711,0.9174,3.6809,7.9853,4.028,3.4686,2.5224,6.8783,6.3756,4.7872,5.3214,0.074,7.6355,1.7502,1.4489,3.7241,6.024,2.2754,3.7335,3.1488,1.3186,6.7094,0.7813,6.6371,0.002,0.8228,0.8352,2.378,2.1396,5.6646,3.9687,3.4993,3.368,0.1654,2.1272,0.1918,0.4924,0.0342,0.1276,0.2516,1.812,11.2824,2.3514,0.7646,3.3777,2.316,2.3963,4.3776,1.3774,1.2864,6.3928,6.5124,8.5149,5.8951,3.6316,0.472,4.5295,0.9131,5.6798,2.8946,0.9486,4.5642,1.4568,0.8956,2.6819,1.6362,4.2059,0.6036,5.221,0.7061,3.0546,3.9004,3.5427,0.9128,1.9354,3.224,4.3617,0.1045,4.1934,0.4761,0.5858,3.8651,0.8306,4.1995,0.5187,0.1437,5.7931,9.153,1.8509,1.6566,3.6428,3.3187,1.7915,2.612,4.1472,7.9833,3.9738,3.559,1.4465,0.9581,2.5289,6.6416,0.4397,0.8562,5.426,1.2898,6.0512,6.9703,0.0112,1.4055,6.2822,1.7473,0.0048,3.976,0.494,1.4173,0.1447,0.5551,2.3783,4.8223,0.0688,3.9124,0.256,0.6617,2.3144,1.866,2.7541,2.4142,3.3269,1.1959,1.2563,1.4192,4.6237,4.5623,6.1131,0.463,4.8463,1.8794,2.8676,8.5052,0.6432,1.095,4.6906,5.7835,0.3319,4.9556,0.9667,4.1756,4.7749,0.9844,7.7609,2.8484,0.8643,8.1517,6.7107,0.0102,2.1756,3.4861,1.4063,5.3841,6.8541,2.2727,2.7656,6.2589,4.1427,1.4347,4.627,5.844,4.5826,2.755,1.8059,3.573,1.5517,2.7317,0.4741,2.179,2.1478,4.0114,2.302,2.7715,1.9708,1.6891,1.5141,7.8332,1.2203,3.6345,7.1826,8.6422,0.3915,1.878,3.6944,1.1058,0.9425,5.0297,3.6791,0.3252,3.9839,3.6086,4.4941,2.9059,0.1574,3.7967,8.9886,1.8432,1.8005,5.4736,4.8562,0.0811,2.0547,1.0986,2.4347,3.6727,4.9129,3.9397,1.6949,2.5702,1.4057,3.856,2.3118,2.2036,5.4112,3.7172,1.5163,3.779,0.6153,0.5473,1.4031,4.7044,3.7285,2.4249,0.0879,2.899,0.4259,3.1217,6.7327,0.5694,1.0122,0.8852,3.151,0.4486,0.0465,3.6411,1.2141,4.874,1.6354,4.3897,1.9463,0.134,5.8294,0.5548,7.1185,1.9211,2.4687,4.3112,1.2374,4.8991,4.3844,3.5636,3.8616,1.3768,1.3375,7.2296,2.6558,5.7033,2.4553,3.8111,3.5931,0.6831,0.8616,3.9749,2.7687,6.6568,5.4016,2.1109,0.5676,0.7569,3.5383,1.599,4.6165,1.8451,2.0039,2.23,0.4764,3.0984,0.0021,1.6983,2.9637,2.6258,2.3791,5.2763,1.769,4.9046,2.1959,2.3494,5.5177,0.6221,1.7977,5.9386,3.3337,1.7215,1.7939,4.7766,3.1532,4.5828,6.2435,3.7245,4.0088,0.3995,5.9586,4.2173,1.5933,4.5136,1.7005,3.7761,0.6238,3.2774,4.2447,0.2667,1.8587,4.9562,1.815]}
{"prompt":"You are an NPC in an MMO that used to be very popular . It is now abandoned , and to see any player is extremely rare .","text":"You are an NPC in an MMO that used to be very popular. It is now abandoned, and to see any player is extremely rare. The last time you saw a player was over a year ago, after a massive raid. The only players you see are rogues and bandits, and that is only if you walk to the point nearest them.\nThis is a very strange looking place. There are a lot of people here, but most are the same strange looking types in the pictures that I posted earlier. Do all those people look happy to see you? They are all looking at you just like a stranger. What is your name?\nThe answer you are looking for is out there. Please get an online dating profile that is going to get you a man interested in you.\nRemember, there is a big difference between a friend and someone you want to go out with. Make friends with men you go to the movies with and hang out with in the malls. After all, you need to have a few friends that you can get your information from when you meet a guy and it is just important that a man knows what kind of person you are.\nWhen you have an online dating profile that is going to get you interested in a guy, you have to remember that you need to be open and honest about yourself. If you just try to pretend that you do not have those desires, men will not want to do anything with you.\nYou can ask a guy to do something that you both want, but make sure that you only ask him if you are prepared to do what you want to do after. If you are not open and honest, then you are not going to find the man that you want. Be confident about your choices, and that your feelings on the subject matter do not change every day.\nYou are a very nice girl, and it is important that you are not afraid of being with someone. Try to relax and enjoy what you are doing. Keep in mind that you should find someone who is going to make you happy and have a loving time.\nThe next time you get online, you need to take a few minutes and create an online dating profile that you think you are going to stand out with, even if you are going to be a total stranger. All you have to do is use the tips that you found to write about yourself and the things that you like that you would want a man to do the same.\nI know it is hard to start a new relationship, but if you are willing to work hard and follow these tips, you will be able to find a man that you want to spend the rest of your life with.\nRemember, if you are not confident about yourself and not sure about what you want in life, then you are not going to have that man that you will be happy with.

{"prompt":"Build your own best friend ! The future of friendship .","text":"Build your own best friend! The future of friendship. This is what I hope for. These are the memories of my childhood and adolescence. It still touches me to write about it. I wrote about my best friends. All girls. And I have one with a boy now. We have been friends for 10 years and we are the same age now.\nThere is a moment every day in my life where I can look back at all the days we spend together. The simple moments but also the not so simple moments. We were always together and would travel together. Sometimes only one girl. Always good times.\nWe shared all our emotions and we even had a secret language we didn\u2019t give out to anyone. The girls didn\u2019t understand our language at first.\nWe had our best parties and we had a big family around us \u2026 and now I want to be one of them because I think that was my family and I don\u2019t want to lose it.. I am not sure if I should thank the people who made it up to me or thank the people who made it bad \u2026 The people who said you are ugly, you don\u2019t fit in here and the people who did everything to make me understand that there are people who like me as I am. There is nothing that I want. That would make me happy. No friends, no family. There is only you and your own little reality. I lost everyone that I considered my family so I have decided to try and find them by meeting new people.\nMy best friends will be there to laugh and to share the simple things with me. The people who will listen to me and cheer me up and be my confidant. You will be the first people that I visit when I have sadness. I will go to the party or go out with you to the park. I do not want to be alone in the world. I do not have any real friends now. Everything has changed for the worse. I don\u2019t want this to be the case for my future too.. I really want people.. I want a career and I really miss working. That\u2019s why I have decided to come live with you in the world of the movies and dreams.. I do not want to be alone.\nI can understand what you are going through if you have people that made you miserable and they made you hate yourself, but you cannot do it for someone else.. You are not even close to him yet..

{"prompt":"Every morning you wake up and a small device sits on your nightstand with a green light . Today , that light is red .","text":"Every morning you wake up and a small device sits on your nightstand with a green light. Today, that light is red. \u201d\nThe red light on the night table is a reminder to change your sleeping hours (from 7:00 in night to 6:00 in morning) on Monday morning.\nWith the sleep debt, you are more likely to feel tired and restless. But even if you get up at 06:00, your body will not get enough rest to recover you.\nIt\u2019s not worth it. Change your sleeping hours and you will see that you will soon feel like a new person.\nYou might have thought that the goal to sleep is about getting an extra hour of sleep. But if we talk about the quality and the frequency of bedtimes, having a perfect sleeping pattern is not so basic.\nThere are two types of sleep patterns. According to the Harvard Medical School, the type of sleep pattern can be classified as :\nThe first type of sleep pattern describes the person who sleeps well at night but doesn\u2019t get enough sleep at day time. According to a study, the quality of sleep at night is the major factor impacting the quality of daytime sleep. Thus, if you have a good night of sleep, chances are you will get a good night of good sleep the day after (after having a good night of sleep).\nIn contrast, you are the opposite person. You always wake up early in morning and can\u2019t sleep till late even if you wake up very late after you\u2019ve gone to bed at night.\nIf you are someone who has the first type of sleep pattern, you will have enough time to do several activities. But if you are having sleep problems, you should focus your energy on improving your sleep. And there is a simple solution for that:\nThe night wake-up is the most common symptom of having a sleep problem. When you have the morning night-time wakeup, it means that although you are sleeping enough at night you still get into a deep sleep early in the morning. Your body is not getting enough rest. Thus it is important to understand why you get this symptom.\nTo clear up your mind about the night wake-up, you need to do some sleep problems in the morning sleep logs.\n\u201cEvery morning you wake up and a small device sits on your nightstand with a green light. Today, that light is red \u201d\nIt must be because your routine is based on what you do in the morning. You start your day in the same sequence. You wake up, take a quick shower, then eat breakfast, then sit on the computer or read. But the sequence must always be the same. If you change it, you might wake up a bit later. If you don\u2019t change it, you will wake up earlier. However, the moment you wake up early, you feel disorganized.","token_len":597,"entropy":[7.9162,3.9414,3.0259,0.026,1.2414,5.2355,5.2922,8.1707,5.4203,1.0325,0.2285,7.0963,0.0067,4.5223,1.1969,5.7286,1.0619,1.4489,7.4912,1.6036,4.3059,2.0682,1.1714,4.2089,0.8062,12.3616,7.7547,2.0478,7.5302,4.1784,0.4398,4.1505,0.8898,1.1305,8.8764,1.2589,2.0187,4.7427,2.1948,4.867,0.9252,3.9695,7.4675,4.7474,4.8682,2.9549,1.3502,0.5192,6.5669,8.4623,0.5418,2.377,0.0363,0.1443,0.1991,1.0788,1.5762,4.483,4.5991,3.4007,0.4956,1.8136,5.8597,1.7924,6.1006,12.352,1.8925,0.9931,2.7922,4.3657,0.3979,0.0264,4.1783,2.1411,1.6647,4.3117,1.6246,4.455,4.6064,1.0298,0.1919,3.9115,2.3123,2.1883,9.823,0.2653,0.1335,1.2043,1.9918,3.1449,1.2607,2.1894,3.8566,2.8288,2.6248,1.8189,3.1425,5.9016,1.1048,1.0619,3.8675,14.0226,9.5387,1.7951,2.2745,4.5132,1.2302,1.4101,7.7133,0.317,2.0818,0.6942,2.9508,1.4559,0.6878,5.0029,2.6209,1.0408,2.9059,5.2417,3.5289,3.6373,1.2855,4.4645,0.6011,0.4973,0.8057,3.0202,3.3706,3.0663,4.2897,0.7767,2.839,6.5577,4.1754,4.0341,2.1725,6.5774,2.1502,5.0993,2.6723,2.0092,1.116,0.2779,1.698,1.7126,3.5649,4.5531,5.3974,0.1215,1.8366,5.5084,3.417,3.6068,5.3823,0.2217,5.1175,3.1265,0.523,8.5647,1.4925,6.3825,3.535,2.5392,1.0304,1.524,4.3191,9.0475,0.2287,0.7348,3.7992,0.5898,2.5371,2.4798,0.0144,0.9809,1.21,1.2723,6.7357,0.0011,1.3778,6.6279,2.3952,0.0553,1.2676,2.2014,4.4483,0.6259,0.2805,1.4115,5.5105,0.6653,4.5383,0.8993,6.3266,0.6286,2.9103,2.5177,0.5417,0.9313,0.124,0.5033,6.2251,1.3488,5.7472,2.1847,2.1213,3.1578,2.8522,0.477,3.6254,2.9991,3.9462,2.1905,0.4241,2.1293,0.9217,1.1488,2.0329,2.4946,2.0069,0.3282,6.0454,0.0015,3.5467,1.0951,2.3097,1.8144,5.4282,0.1591,0.647,3.6817,0.3397,0.8824,3.1496,5.2083,1.374,7.3891,1.1805,0.5769,0.0541,7.4749,0.5254,0.5363,6.6403,0.2046,2.9792,0.5836,1.9334,0.846,2.2184,1.8416,4.2174,0.3534,0.7013,5.2892,0.0658,1.0611,0.5656,1.4383,2.1114,0.6587,0.4651,0.749,5.6257,0.4923,5.2415,2.5776,1.1402,5.4869,4.1164,3.5674,1.2351,0.4659,0.2641,0.9431,0.2702,0.6062,0.6935,3.3993,3.291,0.261,5.5598,2.6693,4.2124,6.3869,6.3109,0.9583,1.6368,5.8034,2.8542,0.0435,3.1455,2.6392,6.8376,1.2572,4.6412,6.885,0.2423,0.0915,3.1213,4.9148,3.7609,7.6961,0.9413,0.219,4.6077,0.0687,4.6677,1.0722,5.9706,3.0042,9.0818,0.0753,1.2541,4.2444,0.2851,0.25,2.8932,2.9039,0.1634,0.8599,3.1604,0.2822,1.7218,6.5004,0.1493,2.1029,3.7795,4.014,0.2319,0.0185,0.1649,0.1138,0.5276,1.5416,1.2434,2.2713,6.2687,1.7418,0.261,4.1237,6.4413,3.0311,2.645,2.7211,0.8503,0.1003,0.8659,6.3312,4.2916,0.3034,1.1101,0.7049,3.6253,4.6604,2.7034,2.7949,0.368,3.4339,0.3393,0.8958,1.6543,4.5256,4.6257,1.0819,1.6748,4.006,1.5806,2.2916,2.5452,1.2291,1.7847,3.7598,4.774,9.3413,3.5013,0.0406,3.2446,2.0156,2.0906,3.984,4.7292,0.4078,6.4789,0.7714,1.8293,0.3855,0.3141,4.0233,0.5945,2.7579,2.2753,3.8473,5.7965,3.4798,2.661,0.8213,3.2197,0.5261,2.6316,3.4491,0.6755,8.9213,0.3813,1.123,2.5799,8.3398,3.2103,0.3742,3.6221,3.8881,2.4514,6.3218,1.9583,4.2794,0.4349,7.8669,0.8999,0.0781,0.3714,0.3608,5.2661,0.5123,2.1249,2.0279,3.5817,0.1767,0.6772,1.7358,5.7627,3.8212,0.8811,2.31,0.379,5.7834,3.3401,1.4394,2.319,3.6868,4.396,0.634,0.3504,3.9085,6.8567,0.6441,1.8013,3.3218,2.2757,1.3109,3.9942,0.9189,0.2314,0.0094,0.4278,1.3143,1.7839,0.0899,4.0222,1.2256,4.6338,4.8547,3.1565,1.1487,0.2513,8.3935,10.8368,0.3225,1.2434,5.8686,4.2828,8.0069,0.4751,1.328,0.4677,0.0065,0.5115,0.1989,0.35,0.021,0.0166,0.0015,0.0064,0.0516,0.0006,0.0513,0.0059,0.0235,0.0022,0.0129,0.1164,0.0106,0.0023,0.004,0.0018,0.0172,7.7966,0.0373,0.6322,4.193,6.5855,0.337,4.2742,2.4737,9.4723,1.0158,6.053,0.1329,4.7043,0.7097,2.093,1.956,0.231,0.1391,0.6429,2.6125,5.3326,2.7351,0.8929,3.0279,0.4826,3.6704,7.0628,2.3969,1.9175,2.8686,0.0447,4.7041,3.4393,0.5979,3.91,1.5204,0.3965,3.447,5.0182,1.1291,2.3419,1.3059,4.7772,3.2276,0.4644,6.343,3.7886,5.5987,3.6282,3.614,2.9271,7.2308,5.6364,4.1858,0.5471,1.3058,0.0148,0.4691,2.7954,0.3966,4.9114,2.8334,1.7264,1.1259,4.179,3.5094,0.026,3.8714,1.9594,1.7239,1.646,2.3919,0.2738,2.4135,0.6488,0.1528,0.0167,0.5761,0.3709,0.3077,0.5613,1.3955,1.6627,0.0125,3.9122,0.6942,4.6156,0.0685,2.8698,5.6288,0.4012,2.0108,0.015,3.9047,1.2925,0.9383,5.2414,8.1103,2.1093,1.0694]}
{"prompt":"An immortal wizard who has been trapped in the body of an animal for a very long time , discovers the internet .","text":"An immortal wizard who has been trapped in the body of an animal for a very long time, discovers the internet. He tries to use it to restore his lost magic, but ends up turning into a horrible internet monster called The King.\nThe film has been written by the same team ( Mark L. Green, Gary Sherman and John August ) who wrote the very successful 2001 fantasy film The Princess Diaries.\nAn adaptation of the classic children\u2019s book, Peter Pan - Neverland. The story of Peter Pan, a boy who runs away from home as a child, is told through the story of Tinker Bell, a kind fairy with green wings and blue sparkly hair. As a child she fell in love with Peter ( the boy ) but eventually she lost her love to Wendy ( the girl ) because she loved Peter, even though Wendy did not. Tinker Bell had to leave Peter\u2019s world to become a magical fairy. But she never forgot about Peter Pan, and one day she decides to give Peter her love forever. A fun fantasy film that the whole family can enjoy.\nA modern day version of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale featuring the very popular Disney princesses. The film tells the story of Beauty who is the owner of a beautiful lily pond in a small town with seven other fairies who are always dancing in her pond. One day when she is dreaming of Prince Charming, a handsome but not very intelligent young man, all of the other fairies leave to form a band. Only two of the fairies remained, and when the fairy king hears about the beauty of Beauty, he sends her a very handsome prince. She loves him, but her beauty always makes her afraid of him and she also does not like him very much. The film has beautiful songs ( The song \u201cMy heart was made of glass \u201d will surely impress young kids ) and very beautiful images. The fairies do look like beautiful princesses, and they are very friendly and kind. The story is very simple, but it is still nice and full of charm. It is probably best suited for young kids. The last part of the film could have used a bit more time and a bit more magic, but you can see that a lot of thought has gone into the film.

{"prompt":"AIs were declared illegal after an attempted uprising ; you just found the equivalent of a child refugee in your computer .","text":"AIs were declared illegal after an attempted uprising ; you just found the equivalent of a child refugee in your computer. Maybe you\u2019ll read this and take into account.\nThe same for the old Soviet and Ukrainian satellites. If you can\u2019t go to them directly maybe you can send the old folks into their graves. In any case they don\u2019t need you except as a reminder of their past.\nI think the only thing the EU can do is start to look for ways to protect its citizens from foreign terrorists who might be involved with the Iranian revolution, but I don\u2019t think it will be terribly helpful in any of the other areas.\nIf there is a plan to kill the Iranian leaders, it better be done soon or else I am not so far out that it won\u2019t take place.\nI think it is more important to help those of Iran\u2019s opponents who might be willing to do something about killing Iranian leaders.\nThe best advice I could give is don\u2019t go into the country \u2013 and I think that\u2019s a pretty solid and sensible recommendation for most people.\nIranian political refugees have been accepted to America. Most of those refugees are from families which have never been politically correct so, by American standards of acceptance, Iran is a better country than most.\nThat is the problem with the UK \u2013 which has a history of being a refuge for disenfranchised political refugees.\n\u201c\u2026the fact is that Iran\u2019s leaders have to be killed in order to overthrow them, for they are in the driver\u2019s seat of the program.\u201d \u2013 No kidding! What world have people lived in?\n\u201c\u2026I think the UK should have been on the list, as it is an ex-Soviet and East European state where the regime is weak and there is a high incidence of dissent.\u201d (I read this quote in \u201cThe Guardian\u201d.) I guess, like the rest of us, it is not a nation that \u201cfeels\u201d safe to be honest!\n\u2026the fact is that Iran\u2019s leaders have to be killed in order to overthrow them, for they are in the driver\u2019s seat of the program.\nI\u2019m afraid that is not a good reason. In reality, the people of Iran are just as much to blame as are of the leadership, which is much more likely to be willing to listen to reason than are most leaders (particularly the rest of the world)!\n\u201cWhat world have people lived in?\u201d \u2013 This is exactly where I am coming from. When I refer to a certain section of the Iranian population, I can say that they live in \u201cunfortunate\u201d times. I think there will be more people who will follow them or be sympathetic with them, the more the world continues to ignore what\u2019s happening in Iran.","token_len":599,"entropy":[9.4815,4.2934,7.059,2.5988,3.6894,3.5993,6.0259,7.8818,14.6544,7.6414,5.6527,5.7335,3.7346,7.0102,0.2633,1.2241,6.5569,9.9808,1.6303,3.0736,8.1437,1.0528,6.9813,1.2895,17.1367,7.4858,3.9859,4.8932,1.7886,2.7646,4.7343,6.287,0.3327,4.9248,1.4039,4.7119,4.9974,5.6853,1.7734,7.5797,6.4224,4.6913,3.9686,7.3443,0.7165,3.9444,0.7474,3.9961,6.4366,0.4765,0.478,5.0426,2.0929,2.9024,6.902,10.7213,0.5837,1.8035,5.8268,3.2923,5.7551,7.9252,3.7716,4.0693,5.5661,0.7363,4.6486,2.7458,0.0798,3.8847,3.8421,0.4992,0.3423,0.029,2.9902,2.5891,8.2324,3.1859,1.1194,3.4827,1.7524,2.4106,3.4395,1.2415,1.0188,3.1237,3.0625,2.2034,3.4333,2.0693,3.3835,4.9562,2.1585,0.5101,0.4256,5.1496,2.4508,3.5085,2.157,1.6377,0.1412,3.4369,1.6662,0.9752,1.2775,4.132,3.3055,2.9071,2.3402,2.4466,5.0796,2.1382,2.2947,8.6455,3.7765,2.5069,2.5456,1.9727,1.7076,0.2852,0.0907,0.0192,0.4877,1.7414,1.5514,1.7911,7.2922,2.2654,2.6628,2.9984,4.1614,1.3761,2.1519,2.702,1.0211,0.9484,3.5714,3.1256,1.1482,1.2625,5.2112,0.9343,6.1298,2.4317,3.5679,5.0558,1.3661,2.4197,8.2492,0.5356,2.7714,4.0483,3.3646,2.7567,3.3821,3.6079,1.6299,4.5251,6.2063,4.5132,3.0264,2.5806,4.0197,0.3394,0.1076,0.2863,3.6271,3.1523,0.233,0.9752,2.2869,1.9119,1.9625,0.8627,3.9108,1.4231,0.8787,5.6236,2.9885,4.4133,6.2256,3.284,0.0386,0.2044,6.5906,2.6168,2.9564,0.899,3.8723,0.0212,3.0916,1.7078,1.7773,9.4239,4.0951,0.8869,1.2834,1.278,2.6368,5.0122,4.1615,0.8133,2.3459,0.1641,1.4775,6.2476,0.15,0.0955,0.0027,2.7917,2.476,1.8077,2.7159,7.8019,3.7818,2.3316,2.267,1.8489,5.1758,0.0167,0.1138,1.7257,4.1132,6.4716,4.0111,3.6129,3.6278,3.0749,3.5257,0.9094,0.8995,0.6785,5.3631,4.252,4.8335,6.2182,3.2295,1.2909,5.379,3.7135,6.4711,2.4947,4.8716,0.8295,2.9724,3.7904,1.4213,1.9346,6.5511,5.1937,1.672,4.0162,0.9596,7.0062,4.7978,5.5588,4.9574,4.1685,5.4679,0.3988,3.7383,6.1014,0.4808,4.578,1.0757,1.2229,4.9583,1.6191,0.3877,2.3491,2.603,0.7547,4.299,1.4245,2.9456,3.7041,1.3009,1.6359,6.8102,4.6693,4.9076,1.5466,1.975,3.5635,0.0974,2.6697,1.2607,6.8629,0.306,8.1349,0.0049,4.6533,2.6184,0.6964,1.0022,8.4874,5.6719,8.0201,4.4289,4.2019,1.3754,0.6116,4.7801,3.4786,0.0139,0.0127,3.0053,1.7787,5.2406,1.5191,4.9937,2.4415,1.1202,0.1483,5.6131,1.9166,2.5756,5.276,2.7051,1.1676,4.1017,2.1765,9.0582,6.5991,0.0826,1.5359,0.1229,1.9111,1.1923,7.2506,1.0016,5.8674,5.494,8.1251,6.1761,5.4278,2.7117,5.4524,8.7996,4.8187,5.1615,4.577,2.2612,2.8378,1.0024,4.2118,1.4092,0.5645,3.097,1.3142,1.746,2.8441,1.529,3.0246,2.6938,4.638,0.6104,1.7328,3.1087,3.0365,1.5681,1.378,3.3076,6.6756,0.7234,1.1344,4.0242,7.2071,0.5894,2.5207,4.3386,1.7568,4.3435,2.2188,5.4834,0.8398,3.819,0.7614,1.8194,4.449,4.2992,0.0086,4.8277,0.8083,2.6439,0.6797,4.1581,2.6775,6.6973,2.2847,4.1001,2.2438,8.7943,0.6423,4.2338,2.4141,0.7644,2.2209,3.1367,3.9335,4.8422,4.0892,4.4239,1.9126,2.2205,0.0396,2.9963,0.1672,2.2492,1.0093,2.5028,1.8869,6.8709,1.5513,6.7388,0.3566,6.614,0.007,6.6341,5.1176,4.3258,1.4751,2.8803,7.7436,7.576,0.4118,5.8027,2.5445,3.4473,0.1707,0.2934,2.5081,1.2171,0.017,0.0071,0.2832,0.3769,0.0495,0.0089,0.0505,0.1968,0.0092,0.0145,0.083,0.0256,0.3443,0.0367,0.0036,0.0091,0.0036,0.0015,0.0144,0.1228,0.0223,0.0011,0.0005,0.0028,0.0061,0.0104,0.0751,1.0368,2.4815,4.8384,0.1865,0.4918,4.6631,0.8816,3.5909,0.95,2.5049,1.4688,4.4584,2.4106,4.6183,4.4968,0.3813,1.8144,3.8888,1.1072,0.2655,1.0199,4.3725,1.6455,3.7349,3.1542,0.061,1.4021,5.5869,8.368,1.0011,6.9153,4.1944,2.9011,0.7887,5.8412,0.7156,2.831,0.1669,0.8055,6.196,0.0668,5.4127,0.273,7.348,1.6134,6.3535,4.4395,5.835,5.1597,5.1822,2.2599,6.3124,0.0445,0.7953,0.694,5.6846,0.3404,3.0531,0.7484,5.9131,7.6168,1.0253,0.3812,0.0302,0.0045,0.0451,2.5508,0.5251,2.5384,4.3294,0.4701,5.4894,3.773,1.2544,2.7485,3.7785,0.0244,0.7973,4.9537,0.9014,7.4325,0.0298,3.2429,5.1633,5.2987,0.0503,0.469,3.111,1.1112,0.9714,1.046,4.78,3.1859,0.9509,1.7117,3.4414,0.2573,8.6047,0.3629,5.4468,4.3835,0.3534,1.1695,0.4654,3.001,0.6603,2.7759,2.2855,3.538,4.5847,0.3533,3.0904,2.809,1.2248,1.5871,5.0339,4.1877,4.7407,4.2718,4.2343,3.5078,0.1376,1.7859,5.9515,2.5155,3.8421,2.7583,7.6371,0.0587,5.5535,4.2379,6.0531,1.891,0.2604,0.8929,0.8781,0.8864,0.6947]}

''","text":"You awaken on an altar in a strange room. As you begin to explore your surroundings a group of robed figures appear, saying `` For the sake of the universe, please go back to sleep. ''\nWhen you go to bed, the next morning you wake up at the altar, as the people in the room are gone and the room is empty. Suddenly the figure in black jumps out of the altar and begins to approach you. Suddenly the room begins to glow and a big man with a weird black mask appears.\nThe figure in black says, `` The universe is going to change, and you must travel to another dimension, to a strange place with new friends. ''\nLater, you walk into a small cave. A giant man in red is standing at the side, smiling at you. He says,'This world is about to end, but you must make the final sacrifice. I am going to take your soul to my son in the blue dimension. Let us go!\nA very strange blue man appears. His name is Vasil. He says,'My son was about to become a master. I have been waiting a long time to welcome him.\nLater, the man in red says to you as you leave the cave,'I know where your future lies. Go to the blue dimension, to my son! Take my soul! You can give my son your life if you choose, but you do not have to take his soul.\nYou ask,'What is the blue dimension? I have never heard of it.'The man replies,'Follow me to the end of the day, and then I will show it to you.\nAs you enter the end of the day, a black cloud appears before you. It comes closer and closer. As the distance between us diminishes, a bright light shines in front of you. It is a huge lake of pure blue liquid, with many glistening lights around.\nOn the opposite shore, you see a man, with long silver hair. His eyes are like glowing diamonds.\nThe man waves his hand to you. You see that his clothes are also pure blue, with tiny blue balls floating all over his clothes.\nThe man says,'This lake is the water of life. It comes from deep within your soul. Here we have a special place for your soul. '\nOn the shore beside you, the man introduces himself as Dazhree. He says,'My son has not yet learned how to use your soul.

{"prompt":"The first time I met the devil was at a diner in upstate New York .","text":"The first time I met the devil was at a diner in upstate New York. I was sitting with my girlfriend, a beautiful red-headed girl, and a tall dark-haired girl who sat right across from me. It was her first night back from a six-month stint in the military and everyone in that diner was just as excited about it as she was. She was talking with a handsome guy she had met online. He had taken one look at her and asked her to go on a romantic dinner date. I was feeling all warm and fuzzy for that beautiful redhead. She had a good figure, nice long limbs and a smile to match. The handsome guy who had gotten my girl into his arms was on the verge of tears because he just loved her like no one else. The girls around us felt the butterflies and were trying their best to keep up. At one point, when my girlfriends eyes lit up and her face became flushed, a fellow diner told her: \u201cHey girlfriend, don\u2019t you think he looked at you long enough to know you want to go on a date?\u201d\nThe beautiful redhead\u2019s face turned red just as her girlfriend turned and looked at the man. She was just so upset that he hadn\u2019t taken her on that date. She was trying to justify herself to her girlfriends by saying it was the guy who asked her for the date, not her. I could not hear the end of their conversation because they wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. I was trying to be polite, smile and drink, but couldn\u2019t believe they were even talking to me about something so serious. A man was looking at me long enough to ask me out? How could I get so jealous and upset? Couldn\u2019t I love someone just because he asked? I hated people that were so wrapped up in themselves that they thought they were the one someone wanted. So, while everyone else was being upset by the handsome guy\u2019s lack of self-control, I was just glad his girl didn\u2019t like me.\nThe next thing I knew my stomach was in knots. I reached out to my friend. I was still sitting in the car with my new girlfriend and the handsome guy was just a few feet away. I could hear her laughing, but her tone was light. A light that was soon to turn sour. We finally got into the diner and sat down. My girlfriends smile vanished. She looked out the window. It was starting to look like it was going to rain. He was waiting for her outside and she had given herself up like a lamb to the slaughter. He wanted her to know he loved her and she could be sure of his intentions. He had asked her on a date and he had been taking her on dates for almost a year.
