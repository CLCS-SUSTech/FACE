{"prompt":"You ( or the main character ) have accidentally killed someone or otherwise caused them to die","text":"You ( or the main character ) have accidentally killed someone or otherwise caused them to die. This chapter sets up a scene between you and your dead brother. Use this chapter and chapter 2 to get to know your brother, and also let him know you still live.\nA good use for this chapter would be to show them how your brother reacted to the world around him the day he died. How did he react to the news of your death? Was he shocked, angry, or even grateful? Think about creating a scene between a dying brother and his family (or friends).\nA common use for this chapter is that of the death of another character, but it can be used to show how the loss of their parents affects the main character. Using it in this fashion can help you create a scene that truly shows how the character feels about the loss of their family and how they cope with it. This is a pretty good use for these chapters, and if done well it can be very effective.","token_len":201,"entropy":[5.1761,9.4353,3.9888,7.3432,0.4207,1.3939,3.9944,8.8721,2.8872,2.283,3.1154,6.7356,2.7824,4.4948,1.1746,2.1102,0.8896,3.0535,8.3039,6.7249,0.9259,1.3133,4.3347,4.0548,3.1266,0.1004,2.1873,5.4676,3.3463,1.4892,7.3461,1.9891,2.3895,4.6202,4.7797,2.5684,0.9862,2.7288,1.9726,1.7318,1.5694,0.99,2.5606,1.4264,4.5344,6.2853,1.4716,0.4025,1.9921,5.4284,4.9285,1.151,1.559,6.5974,4.4092,5.8332,3.1879,0.5083,0.4559,4.3869,0.0471,0.9192,3.6533,4.3712,1.7384,3.1044,0.9053,5.5809,0.6978,1.8659,5.3719,2.2066,1.3875,7.3445,3.4464,1.7466,0.5802,0.4816,5.15,2.7773,0.8387,0.6274,0.7913,1.3607,3.8339,1.7791,0.8383,1.1722,0.5722,3.8176,0.9058,3.8927,2.3299,2.9597,0.2838,0.8087,3.1861,7.1475,0.8323,7.1099,0.5834,10.5764,0.7082,1.2111,1.988,4.637,4.251,0.3643,0.0716,1.9477,4.0048,4.3405,1.594,3.7395,2.1667,1.7371,2.9421,4.597,2.1721,0.9891,0.2071,0.4048,0.7202,4.9094,3.0343,3.428,4.5904,0.5319,4.2301,1.5989,2.1169,3.429,2.3846,2.4559,1.1773,1.3618,1.0186,1.7341,1.7422,2.5441,6.4104,0.7753,3.7552,4.5584,4.0828,1.6744,4.7664,0.171,0.9012,5.9791,4.5695,2.3347,0.5889,4.5475,2.412,2.1009,1.9567,4.5773,0.8957,1.8842,1.3643,6.2684,1.9748,1.0879,2.1406,2.1702,2.7238,0.6282,1.7066,1.6536,0.2262,0.8871,2.5825,2.5866,2.0522,1.105,4.5151,0.2859,1.038,0.117,3.1681,1.9426,1.8278,5.02,1.7803,1.0268,1.1993,4.7484,2.0081,1.2428,1.67,3.7377,5.1396,1.6066,2.6202,0.779,1.5032,2.5485,2.0451,0.6455]}

Your job is to walk the trails of the world to record them. You have to stay at hostels and eat with locals. By doing so, you will have a great view of the whole area.\nIn my experience, this is the best type of trip and I would recommend it. The advantage of this trip is that you will stay in places that have special features. However, the disadvantage is that it requires discipline and you will have to put up with a lot of discomfort.\nIn my opinion, the best combination of trekking and travel would be a six-day trip from Kathmandu to Pokhara, for example. In this trip, your job is to walk part of the Annapurna Base Camp trek along with the Pokhara to Annapurna hike. This is a very interesting combination.\nThis entry was posted in Blog and tagged backpacking, travel, trekking on June 4, 2019 by David.","token_len":206,"entropy":[3.8828,2.3263,2.6508,7.6302,8.2236,2.5438,1.7865,1.8665,1.4437,7.7047,3.4183,0.9149,3.6745,4.8182,0.2721,0.2309,5.2743,2.7334,5.1212,1.9213,1.3826,1.034,2.8189,7.6184,5.9042,1.1267,2.1056,2.9131,0.9898,4.9866,3.5724,10.4543,0.1397,1.248,4.4502,4.2223,3.7294,0.9791,6.4856,2.1259,1.0672,0.3539,0.0696,2.242,3.3699,1.9663,4.2189,5.0324,0.2302,0.5112,4.2894,4.4956,0.8907,1.3677,9.4491,3.1299,1.8283,0.2707,3.3456,1.0409,1.5747,1.6753,7.0853,0.0047,3.6889,4.6855,1.9933,2.6624,0.9145,0.8754,2.0129,2.6768,8.4398,0.7012,1.5488,1.1121,0.208,0.3852,0.6038,1.5961,4.85,1.5235,5.6024,1.4952,2.9583,5.8542,3.3803,1.7527,5.563,0.0568,2.6555,2.116,0.3905,0.1066,2.419,3.5898,9.5299,1.0768,2.5977,0.743,1.5281,0.1679,4.9627,1.3042,0.067,2.2376,0.5166,0.066,6.0024,0.8922,1.1835,3.1244,1.8995,2.1335,0.1116,1.8644,0.7226,5.9024,0.3316,7.0027,0.0269,0.6898,4.0071,4.5836,0.077,2.2,7.2851,0.836,0.5804,1.0501,3.6421,4.8905,0.0005,0.0,0.2959,7.0542,0.4823,0.273,1.8614,5.5694,1.0328,0.4075,3.2962,1.8336,3.0737,0.4122,4.0899,5.3481,0.4185,0.1748,2.9064,9.377,0.3042,0.2373,11.4696,0.4104,0.0144,0.0019,8.9494,2.7338,8.7394,4.3142,3.1653,2.1958,6.5925,0.0286,0.0104,6.1817,3.9179,0.0023,0.0112,0.0113,4.7847,0.814,2.1654,1.3665,1.3549,2.8002,4.5976,4.5199,1.4942,1.105,3.502,7.162,1.3871,0.947,4.6528,5.8614,3.9002,7.9793,10.1353,8.9355,3.0835,3.1098,0.5555,3.3213,0.0043,7.5274,8.0108,3.4213,0.3658,8.522,6.4982,4.9851,2.921]}

But Huber's brother has insisted that he has been the catalyst for Huber's interest in rugby and he has also said that his family has been supportive.","token_len":207,"entropy":[7.8605,9.7594,3.3559,10.769,8.354,6.6735,5.6997,3.5541,2.6496,3.3256,7.2532,4.3459,3.7841,2.9245,5.3254,5.299,0.8033,5.76,3.0581,2.4252,0.0217,0.186,3.5782,2.7041,5.4343,1.9082,3.6357,2.4053,1.0896,0.9859,0.2133,0.0419,5.6954,11.7965,2.0587,1.868,8.4098,0.0684,2.4386,4.2695,1.1425,1.8488,1.9652,9.1454,4.9894,0.9672,1.2571,0.4847,1.5497,7.9263,1.9858,5.6529,4.9546,7.0411,10.189,3.0474,11.381,6.9595,11.4053,7.9044,11.877,3.5782,11.0382,6.4049,2.8406,7.5677,7.7133,2.4383,0.0062,0.558,8.5455,1.8084,4.7849,0.1661,7.5829,10.2544,3.4919,0.9765,6.7898,2.8037,3.1039,1.776,3.296,0.4679,6.8006,1.9934,1.6138,5.3549,0.3562,1.4382,4.1182,4.7183,1.4145,6.0741,1.2687,7.2096,3.5821,5.8012,0.8836,3.0825,3.0787,2.3251,4.3646,5.089,1.3697,0.4917,1.0991,5.6207,1.4721,7.1622,4.1195,2.0981,1.8394,6.4485,3.7514,1.036,1.2864,0.6494,0.6105,0.404,5.8282,1.3266,2.2331,0.7539,6.8796,0.0067,1.318,3.3649,3.6928,0.0065,0.0015,0.0023,8.0355,7.0661,7.428,1.0768,7.22,0.7777,3.4051,4.8888,0.0003,7.0401,3.9094,0.6533,5.2112,2.3025,7.2469,2.554,5.3386,5.69,1.137,6.1089,2.6006,0.5314,4.0126,1.6184,3.467,1.6803,2.3694,6.9633,0.2761,0.0032,3.1521,1.4239,3.1152,2.8664,2.8647,6.6764,0.0165,1.7058,8.2669,5.1304,4.0815,0.5896,2.7553,3.5681,0.007,1.2227,5.3798,3.8762,6.9087,0.5831,1.2711,2.2681,3.0336,3.3852,5.5416,0.8182,4.5744,0.0111,0.4334,6.4503,0.1991,4.3766,2.1515,2.4727,1.8818,3.1087,2.5837,0.4915,1.9771,2.5048,1.774,1.2541,3.5583,1.6769]}

He then decides to put it back after the Ring has been cast again. Sauron has several thoughts, and one is that he wanted a Ring that it would rule the world from a distance, and thus the One Ring is perfect. Before putting the Ring back, Sauron sees a ring and remembers that he left it on Isildur's finger, and asks the ring what happened. The ring reacts and shows the image of Isildur's death and tells Sauron. When Sauron realizes that he is too powerful alone and that only other Ring can help him he decides to take all three Rings from Sauron, and destroy his power.

For only $6, you can help the US celebrate freedom by answering questions and letting others know about this event.\n*You can view the results and statistics from the event, so you will remember it the next time you go - this survey will be available until August 10, 2012, but I recommend watching the news and online for changes made before then.","token_len":208,"entropy":[3.8828,4.1252,5.686,2.268,5.9139,3.2456,0.8477,3.2242,4.238,1.1337,1.1506,1.2209,3.2182,0.9311,10.1174,5.3105,2.4386,0.0738,1.936,0.9294,2.3755,2.4802,1.2884,0.8316,2.1875,1.5351,3.0773,4.2343,4.7783,1.1017,0.4134,7.7774,1.556,1.9407,2.5093,4.6924,2.0388,0.9774,1.5054,6.2978,0.7171,1.7718,2.9005,7.9523,1.7886,0.1142,2.1592,3.1382,6.2008,4.3321,1.0925,1.9774,1.9409,2.7667,2.1835,4.9978,1.312,2.2848,0.5347,2.1797,3.5694,0.2376,2.6394,0.9254,1.5071,5.1907,7.1942,4.3171,4.9377,2.2409,3.3844,1.3813,1.7524,2.8844,2.706,3.6395,4.2897,5.271,0.1752,3.3138,0.6318,4.3091,5.5737,1.1678,1.9644,0.1583,1.1898,0.5878,0.9337,3.5708,2.3853,4.4341,0.0816,11.8014,1.2855,5.021,0.4663,0.6459,1.9236,1.9322,5.4212,1.4716,2.9281,4.9793,10.2666,4.4679,3.6777,2.8408,1.1143,1.2515,0.8976,5.2481,1.4144,1.2511,1.1044,0.1707,0.102,5.2277,2.8775,3.7972,1.535,4.1961,1.901,3.4863,4.5108,1.2367,1.0195,0.6888,2.6383,2.9395,0.2155,3.8886,5.0678,7.0955,2.1252,5.9792,6.9713,0.2055,3.8637,1.9738,0.5709,0.751,3.9167,3.8203,5.1832,6.6893,7.8137,3.2429,4.6912,2.3503,2.8253,5.0874,2.1154,0.1563,1.3686,2.2854,2.5771,0.426,1.6591,11.4702,4.0662,1.3926,4.2819,1.1641,3.4692,3.7898,5.7559,2.9056,1.1677,5.2289,3.5925,3.1515,1.5994,3.2704,6.0113,3.1933,5.009,1.7389,0.108,0.1038,2.2385,8.0723,4.107,2.0543,1.0746,1.6725,3.6252,4.0724,3.459,3.8084,1.3823,3.3498,2.9467,3.9172,4.4971,4.0072,6.2211,0.9446,5.9087,2.3189,7.2871,3.0065,8.4972,6.0772,4.9626,2.663,0.2066]}

Some people have a certain image or way of thinking about a memory while not having similar reaction and reaction to certain experience or situations while others do. The collective unconscious is what dictates how people will act and react to even the same situation, experience or condition. It is also the one that dictates how memories are formed in our minds.

And it was impossible to see them at that point.","token_len":211,"entropy":[8.7215,10.6921,7.3454,2.5956,3.3788,3.0769,3.31,7.7107,9.3199,1.4276,9.6611,5.1547,2.9755,5.7866,5.4001,2.5784,4.7104,3.0181,5.6347,2.959,5.222,0.3902,0.1027,4.5019,4.3221,7.7363,5.7548,5.9524,5.5732,3.5995,5.8386,4.8016,4.7847,1.33,5.829,0.634,1.9852,8.235,5.4781,3.8124,3.492,8.183,2.7593,2.1628,5.4374,5.5776,1.4609,4.2682,2.2879,3.4755,2.6692,1.2724,0.6743,1.4121,4.4194,2.3215,2.8244,2.9255,1.9486,7.6331,1.9264,0.9822,4.8072,0.8503,3.1172,6.238,0.9031,2.4668,2.4975,0.9127,1.4726,3.6721,0.8508,1.3083,0.9445,2.6682,4.9593,1.8148,0.1849,1.9179,3.1609,1.0192,0.7063,3.2659,0.066,4.5985,0.1691,2.0679,1.4169,0.9091,1.6573,4.6988,3.06,8.0164,6.3583,0.7322,1.5192,5.0995,2.814,0.222,3.484,1.25,2.9929,1.9229,3.4911,5.1863,2.8695,8.5365,2.9247,1.6701,4.2017,0.1818,2.3273,0.6373,0.5668,0.941,2.8743,3.075,1.0297,1.298,2.9865,3.818,4.9537,7.4826,1.8083,2.3874,1.91,0.6299,4.1212,3.3747,5.7276,0.4262,1.2626,5.915,3.4132,8.8222,2.8262,4.6993,2.7769,3.2042,3.118,4.5545,2.2399,1.3379,4.9705,1.396,3.4103,2.3914,1.3242,1.103,0.8714,3.3517,5.309,1.3653,5.8326,3.7394,0.166,1.9457,1.4815,0.3967,0.071,1.9062,0.2264,1.0988,5.9843,3.2596,0.8414,0.1519,1.2465,2.3647,5.1675,8.2607,4.6159,0.4896,3.5413,2.0592,4.0902,3.3533,3.3259,2.9471,6.6258,4.8922,5.1429,1.9476,1.5048,4.4966,1.0105,3.275,0.8303,3.0851,2.4151,1.9626,4.5743,5.7149,1.7718,0.9448,6.4222,5.2255,1.4653,3.9332,3.8112,0.8544,5.7962,0.8145,2.8836,2.1361,3.6705,2.4833,3.8239,0.5971]}

He is soon confronted by God who wants to know how he `` figured it all out ''. Having had a really bad week, he decides he will tell the story of his life from his point of view. They will be a long journey for both, as Douglass has problems of his own, and God takes his time pacing the floor trying to grasp all sides of the story.

Better to live the life I choose, and do good in the world, wherever I am.","token_len":218,"entropy":[8.9543,2.5445,9.608,9.7467,1.0157,3.6862,3.8155,2.2422,1.5726,0.7291,0.0146,2.4112,2.3156,3.6463,0.9401,12.2959,8.1688,3.5832,7.6811,0.4227,2.8239,5.3849,5.8007,3.0388,5.9592,1.0782,0.1295,0.9119,6.2699,4.3365,4.1724,7.486,1.4031,9.9615,1.6255,5.9108,6.0537,0.0649,4.4072,4.4199,2.5809,0.4541,5.7309,2.5469,3.6792,5.9069,3.8525,1.9488,7.2709,0.5914,5.8909,5.3079,2.9465,0.7908,1.2226,2.22,1.7766,3.4715,1.231,7.9833,0.0017,0.0011,7.2948,3.9094,3.6536,2.8779,3.2186,1.9498,1.2603,3.5888,6.0051,1.3866,9.2008,1.5891,6.9759,10.443,3.1195,3.2897,0.2798,2.4692,1.9916,5.3799,1.8114,5.7883,0.1684,2.3885,6.2504,6.0973,6.7871,1.996,3.7455,0.9489,1.2003,1.7293,1.289,2.5017,0.977,6.5378,5.0093,3.8375,1.9927,2.1032,6.6929,3.7215,0.0981,2.7915,3.2152,1.5463,5.5312,3.9199,0.5239,3.3093,6.4735,1.2311,2.1656,4.9871,2.8804,2.4959,3.4594,1.5952,0.0081,0.7831,4.5434,5.4493,5.5649,4.3371,5.7869,1.6356,1.1425,3.1839,0.9871,1.1091,2.535,2.8705,6.775,0.6627,0.1393,4.0105,1.584,2.1243,1.4951,4.8861,0.2304,5.1528,0.4481,1.8608,7.9509,3.5204,1.7611,3.4639,5.7873,2.643,5.095,2.433,4.7611,1.233,4.5458,2.5819,5.3069,2.0624,4.8651,1.2441,4.6502,4.7939,1.571,1.4043,0.4199,0.6869,3.7969,8.1069,1.6915,1.7659,0.7145,0.326,4.3639,1.3844,2.2633,0.8394,5.4719,2.9038,0.0454,4.125,2.4685,3.554,5.3566,4.831,0.3426,3.0595,6.716,3.7052,0.2234,3.8328,3.332,2.0259,3.4786,1.477,4.2873,4.0439,8.1206,0.9365,3.2995,2.7464,1.8795,3.8062,5.0507,2.7023,2.3727,4.2117,4.5257,2.8149,0.6811,1.9338,2.6428,8.0406,1.0922,1.6026,0.5211]}

While Matsuzaki lived by herself, Izumi has joined other members into a secret society whose members also work in the law enforcement. After an encounter with a murderer, Matsuzaki lost her boyfriend and her memory about it forever. Now, one year later, she returns to work in the law enforcement agency as an investigator for her former work-mates.

Exhibit the relevant research\nExcerpt: In the 1960s, science thought that animals and plants do most of their replication in a specialized organ called a nucleolus. During the past two decades, researchers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany and the Institute of Molecular Biology in Copenhagen, Denmark discovered that most viruses replicate without using a nucleolus, and that they can replicate in eukaryotic host cells without using a nucleolus. Now, these discoveries have been confirmed by a team of researchers led by Peter Peterman, director of the Advanced Cellular Imaging Center at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, in La Jolla, California. The study was published recently in the journal Nature Biotechnology (Peterman et al., 2010, Nature Biotechnology).","token_len":219,"entropy":[6.3947,2.6568,6.395,0.4577,1.8888,4.2448,4.8164,4.7404,3.7768,4.6308,0.8013,2.3964,1.8218,9.6848,2.1716,2.7344,2.3348,2.0865,4.2407,0.0161,2.6165,7.0195,2.0838,8.9407,6.3268,0.7033,0.226,3.3695,6.1373,9.7843,1.2111,0.2156,0.068,2.2596,0.4648,10.3721,2.3164,5.17,1.5149,2.3519,4.8679,4.4997,2.0784,10.4349,3.4657,6.3119,6.475,2.8769,1.7103,6.211,1.5696,2.7432,0.6006,5.3523,0.2429,3.7086,10.1834,2.3552,7.0616,3.9677,5.5232,12.3071,4.1469,1.5373,3.7444,1.6782,4.2865,0.1994,0.511,5.7703,10.009,0.8855,6.1893,2.2421,0.4685,6.645,6.5302,0.0764,0.9404,9.9189,1.5606,2.5344,5.8544,5.6102,0.7345,2.7118,4.1187,6.6073,3.1631,0.8219,5.5969,1.2011,4.0989,3.1164,1.2431,0.1745,3.3758,3.455,1.2774,4.4871,2.0654,1.0911,7.182,1.3955,0.8147,0.6552,0.5041,2.2169,6.3468,0.0296,0.0051,0.8982,0.0951,2.0117,0.4956,4.3507,0.6314,1.3864,0.6246,1.3738,4.724,0.5632,0.0235,4.6423,0.6624,5.3006,6.3203,5.0795,5.1504,4.8264,1.5056,0.9402,0.1221,0.0043,1.5106,2.0149,1.0087,2.8835,3.0051,2.6486,1.7352,7.8006,0.0289,0.0007,1.3707,5.5348,0.1694,3.1124,2.2625,1.4075,1.2195,0.1486,0.0022,0.3104,4.9882,0.5503,4.0102,3.515,1.6146,2.067,1.9427,0.8736,1.8479,1.9551,0.4691,1.8865,3.1597,0.0097,5.4956,6.6086,3.6232,1.8489,4.6867,0.0509,0.226,7.6557,5.9593,6.3623,2.9404,0.4433,0.5041,6.1893,0.6294,0.1018,1.1944,2.8303,1.3559,1.8562,1.3806,6.0962,2.6256,0.0009,0.0239,0.131,0.4505,1.9522,3.6567,1.7158,0.328,4.111,0.0591,0.7349,0.4592,1.1194,3.3613,0.0928,4.2945,10.197,0.0046,0.6539,0.005,0.4489,3.1528,3.1667,6.2187,0.7323,0.0066,1.6158]}

I don't think anyone should write this. You should know that it makes no sense and that there are no accurate or proven records for what really happened. For example, the events of the time of Aesir and Vana'diel was probably based on mythological stories. The people and cultures were not very well defined and most were just legends. The only information you can get from the books is what makes sense in a future times. They did learn about magic but only to an extent. It's almost impossible to see what happens in the time line.

What he doesn't know though is - he, too, is being stalked by yet another, more violent serial killer who ends up killing both him and his original intended victim. When the police figure it out, they are faced with a monster that they have only partially seen. The only way to get to the bottom of what is going on is by turning the lights on and taking the monster down one-by-one, just like the serial killer and the police. With the help of the police and his new victim, the serial killer must decide where to draw the line between who he is and who others want him to be. Based on the play by Stephen Kidd, \"The Day the Light Turns on\" follows a pair of serial killers as they begin to play a game of cat and mouse with the police. The film was produced by the Academy Award winning documentary filmmaker, Andrew Dominik. It features performances by Michael Shannon and Ryan Reynolds as two police officers battling their own demons in an ongoing nightmare.","token_len":223,"entropy":[10.7104,1.5702,8.5229,0.8122,3.2976,9.1769,0.7575,4.8122,2.6436,1.9352,5.5018,7.9533,4.5655,6.8118,4.0753,0.0435,0.8294,11.4727,1.0231,4.9176,2.0676,1.5603,0.0004,0.5356,4.0383,0.479,6.6471,2.3381,7.4168,1.0,0.0505,1.1408,4.0513,1.822,0.0001,0.8548,8.2697,0.1205,5.7241,2.0145,3.702,0.8489,0.0311,3.287,6.644,0.098,2.3428,4.7555,3.9774,0.0399,0.6805,9.1521,7.492,0.2513,0.328,4.9342,1.8097,4.2278,6.4868,2.3986,0.0288,0.5691,1.4054,2.8181,4.7927,0.0203,1.1546,6.5538,1.9876,2.6464,2.4391,4.0248,7.5482,3.8249,1.9371,3.6784,3.804,1.2612,0.6618,2.9001,1.8651,0.9263,1.0531,0.0144,2.9674,2.0793,0.7101,0.0105,0.3221,2.364,6.1742,2.0225,5.0597,0.5568,1.351,5.099,2.256,5.5013,2.151,6.0198,3.3036,0.2248,0.0011,0.0096,2.3999,5.0915,0.9283,1.4007,3.0867,0.2514,4.6427,1.6069,3.7667,1.2688,4.7642,1.6237,0.5164,0.0051,1.9818,3.5974,1.7425,3.8818,3.7563,3.5235,0.3774,1.6302,1.819,0.0317,3.6578,3.9777,3.3041,1.0034,5.0522,0.4367,0.3118,1.2148,6.5855,2.0651,0.8583,0.3288,0.5264,8.3421,2.5867,1.2872,0.0282,0.3553,0.2762,5.8008,0.0677,0.6026,5.5872,1.9837,4.3103,13.0842,1.1672,2.8575,1.5739,6.3095,1.8477,5.8514,4.5845,2.0567,1.3891,4.0384,1.9778,4.7196,0.0338,2.268,0.1719,2.1687,0.0218,5.1932,1.105,6.4439,2.5637,1.2456,0.2886,1.9872,0.0317,0.0021,1.3322,2.8231,2.6881,0.8628,2.2678,4.7988,2.4946,2.4853,0.1688,3.4435,5.4148,0.9993,1.9452,6.448,2.6847,1.9384,5.4965,9.5471,0.6354,1.0577,3.9949,4.0961,4.1771,0.2552,3.8769,4.4805,1.7651,5.5908,2.4893,2.7721,3.9048,3.469,0.3116,4.9154,2.7447,3.1685,2.0681,2.5446,2.3358,4.6597,5.7402,1.0298]}
{"prompt":"A world where Pangea never broke up","text":"A world where Pangea never broke up is a theory about the geology and evolution of the earth and its components. It began to appear as a scientific hypothesis with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origins of Species in 1859. The theory arose based on new biological evidence (Darwin's field work in the Galapagos Islands, notably) that humans had migrated from Africa and were not ancestral to other mammals. It became known from the early 1900s as the \"mega-diversity hypothesis\". In the 1920s and 30s, Charles Lyell published The Structure of the Earth and The Genesis of the Earth, which began to argue that the original Earth consisted of one large continent and one plate tectonics system, and that Pangea broke up to form modern continents only after a long period in Earth's history (many billions of years). It was later shown that an alternative possibility to a Pangea theory was that Earth initially consisted of several smaller continents. An example was that the United Kingdom formerly comprised two continents: Granite and Iron and that they were separated by the sea.","token_len":223,"entropy":[7.7424,2.5115,8.3619,7.1516,0.0952,6.0789,6.6688,2.8329,3.4505,1.9722,11.3297,4.0057,2.0565,8.9801,1.2887,2.6954,3.201,0.0907,1.4828,4.0147,2.4724,1.8106,6.6365,0.669,2.4775,6.4148,3.4006,4.2148,3.3343,0.8958,5.1894,2.1862,4.7223,1.8937,2.9241,0.0989,5.9942,0.5364,0.1772,5.6535,0.2096,8.0705,0.1047,0.0135,0.7312,0.6284,2.6456,0.5532,2.1842,1.9443,5.4234,5.8581,0.1114,6.8592,6.2684,1.4098,4.7424,4.3953,0.001,0.8556,8.0366,3.7832,3.8072,1.3906,7.3481,0.3987,0.0017,0.2598,1.3633,7.9164,2.8542,1.3913,4.5503,3.5807,4.3224,1.0737,1.3435,2.347,3.5429,3.9278,5.7516,0.1462,2.9889,2.727,0.7761,2.7964,3.6831,2.1908,5.4602,1.3956,2.3271,1.5495,0.1379,0.7726,0.7681,1.0158,9.7342,0.6251,4.9536,2.1212,0.2971,1.9268,2.9115,1.7692,3.9914,0.0364,1.8445,1.1777,0.001,0.5498,5.7773,8.8585,0.9765,2.4771,2.1392,5.8813,0.1884,1.4737,0.7204,1.725,3.1297,6.1164,0.2151,3.1108,1.6525,1.3412,1.4064,5.3418,0.7677,5.8239,0.9718,1.2818,5.9361,2.1891,5.0323,0.116,4.639,1.9849,4.1627,1.6329,1.9114,9.6352,2.1735,0.0099,2.2394,2.4388,2.1995,2.3724,0.803,6.6479,0.0171,0.0035,7.1431,0.2044,4.7202,1.7462,7.6197,5.8744,6.7974,2.1493,2.8729,2.976,1.2394,4.0523,6.9727,0.8537,0.6114,3.5917,6.2262,5.7969,0.179,0.0026,0.5835,3.591,1.0548,3.4659,3.1738,0.7313,5.3373,4.7585,7.136,3.7924,4.7627,3.0822,0.0017,0.0189,3.3583,0.8611,0.5639,4.1115,9.253,2.4873,0.0516,3.7217,2.8663,0.7346,2.3606,5.9203,3.4973,3.4549,2.883,1.5927,6.5154,2.7464,8.2204,3.8422,3.3732,1.9808,3.6407,8.6718,1.474,2.3438,4.5849,5.2088,1.0939,5.087,1.3622,3.0853,0.5193,2.7975,3.6122,1.3695]}

{"prompt":"Alien Invasion stories always take place during the present time . Write about an Alien Invasion that happens during the Middle Ages .","text":"Alien Invasion stories always take place during the present time. Write about an Alien Invasion that happens during the Middle Ages. Write about an Alien Invasion event that has happened within the last 10 years and let the reader know what your current opinion is about it.\nMy opinion is that Alien Invasions should not exist within this realm of possibility. First off, you know nothing about Middle-England that is not an urban fantasy. There is no history of a civilization as advanced as our own that exists at the time when Middle-England was at its peak. Also, if an alien invasion happens, all of the history books about our history that happened before the time period that the story happened would change.\nI feel that we have enough history in our books right now. The only time that we could tell a story about a past future world or a past future year would be in a very few books. I do not enjoy reading these kinds of books but I do believe that some of them have been written.\nI don't think that the Middle Ages was all that interesting historically. There wasn't so much to tell either.","token_len":225,"entropy":[10.6435,9.7841,7.5634,4.2674,0.9853,3.5508,0.6808,6.1637,3.4628,1.4732,11.191,3.1445,5.1817,4.9913,1.1937,3.362,2.69,1.8157,0.4134,7.7891,0.1786,1.664,3.3296,0.0842,1.2551,0.7589,0.0781,7.2117,0.563,5.4584,1.3476,6.2419,0.4712,1.7926,3.6448,0.5594,3.5182,7.8329,2.0327,0.619,0.6321,1.4882,4.212,4.8687,4.554,0.5547,2.0167,0.9458,0.1288,1.4218,11.3934,3.455,1.3448,0.5892,3.5979,5.6666,0.0598,3.5711,1.7644,4.4868,5.1572,3.3217,6.1228,1.3667,4.8932,0.4573,7.1861,2.2715,0.189,3.3528,5.0976,4.4206,0.1066,9.4258,3.0467,6.7911,4.7471,2.1166,1.7854,5.6322,5.2191,2.9734,0.8059,3.8614,1.1486,1.1989,4.5256,0.7139,2.5228,3.5388,5.0298,3.9082,0.2149,4.6402,0.3791,2.4259,3.7668,3.1808,1.3154,1.8361,3.5789,4.5726,0.4353,0.0743,0.3608,4.4956,0.4832,1.3195,0.415,4.8373,0.1403,3.0977,3.9967,1.7732,0.4039,2.9476,1.701,5.4505,1.4977,1.0805,3.695,4.6573,3.1757,4.9885,3.8088,3.8835,7.0958,1.8987,2.2768,3.2079,2.7682,2.8971,2.4719,2.684,4.996,3.1362,6.3311,1.2219,2.1833,3.0262,4.7138,0.718,3.8302,1.9913,4.8705,3.0951,2.5639,1.071,2.9953,4.8586,0.0172,3.463,2.7174,2.9601,2.7569,1.7141,1.2241,3.5419,4.7691,1.879,0.5789,1.277,1.5772,5.2853,7.3875,4.0752,4.1852,1.4513,2.0212,2.2993,6.224,1.5783,0.1922,2.3424,2.1718,4.4406,4.7694,1.7259,0.8446,2.454,3.7592,0.6141,7.6445,2.6044,4.8145,3.63,0.0004,1.2928,4.6204,0.768,1.5018,4.165,0.3851,4.2808,0.636,1.6061,2.6161,2.8283,2.045,2.6507,1.3918,1.86,3.5009,0.0021,1.2484,0.7687,2.2469,4.1441,0.5228,2.531,5.0968,0.9253,3.6427,7.3489,0.6795,2.7488,5.4159,0.0004,4.5528,0.0635,4.7564,4.1412,6.1618,0.6207]}

{"prompt":"Mundane Monday : It was a perfect fall day .","text":"Mundane Monday : It was a perfect fall day. Our children drove to the beach to take a picture. A picture of the beach is always a picture of our family. I took the photo and waited for some of us to sign it. One of the kids asked \"Where would Mom go if we could get back in time?\" I explained that she would want to be here at the beach on this day. I smiled and said my daughter would look like a miniature me when I started to get older!!!! Now don't worry we came back from the photos a little late but we were happy to know that I will look like a miniature me when I grow. We ended up eating lunch at the beach after the rain went away. Enjoy the beauty of the summer. When you get your own home you will get to make your own memories and then you can bring the whole family down to the beach. When the kids got older remember all these fun times. Enjoy the time away from home and don't worry about having the same things you had when you were here. Spend time with family and friends. Have fun.","token_len":225,"entropy":[8.533,2.2109,10.4527,7.0437,6.0522,2.1653,1.6362,5.2377,7.3779,0.6555,1.7057,5.2051,5.8124,8.076,1.6977,1.2878,2.9945,2.43,3.4881,1.1838,2.6338,1.4563,3.8433,4.9127,0.7247,2.2843,3.1014,3.147,3.2247,1.3437,4.4427,0.3948,4.709,2.3873,0.6657,3.0248,4.4489,1.8059,2.752,2.5752,6.4399,0.761,5.3876,3.5039,5.2531,0.1598,5.731,2.6624,0.6917,4.5577,0.4653,0.8086,1.3719,3.2201,4.4094,3.0374,5.4927,8.239,2.0738,1.941,2.1919,3.4384,1.9691,4.279,3.3215,1.48,0.8806,1.4226,4.2796,1.1472,3.063,1.4925,5.4347,0.3473,3.1646,3.583,3.3854,1.7665,2.1484,3.6671,4.6239,0.973,0.6049,2.0931,5.1946,0.571,1.0328,5.1932,3.6661,1.5763,5.1053,4.135,1.7215,7.6397,7.2499,5.6703,2.5708,5.7751,2.7303,3.0234,4.3458,11.2336,5.4818,7.7535,0.0047,1.8119,4.3867,6.6453,0.778,4.6361,0.7277,8.4147,4.9623,1.412,2.0416,3.4304,1.5305,1.7541,3.0006,1.1501,5.4069,0.7879,3.8709,3.8341,4.6693,1.159,1.3515,1.2042,1.3721,1.3775,0.6903,1.9826,4.2679,2.3071,5.5121,0.202,5.101,2.63,2.0195,0.9083,1.2236,4.4809,1.7113,6.0596,4.7011,2.667,0.6523,7.4599,1.4672,7.0943,0.4463,0.7903,4.9769,2.0583,6.6469,2.665,2.4789,3.7559,4.3407,4.1331,2.1796,2.1454,3.5192,1.8402,4.204,1.3948,0.0282,3.3912,2.1955,5.4652,1.5635,1.5805,5.0843,3.2996,5.0641,0.2896,6.1331,0.662,1.0863,0.1896,1.1072,5.1362,2.9717,1.9572,3.2112,6.1044,9.5432,4.0246,4.1997,4.7145,3.8604,2.0524,5.602,0.7185,3.855,4.0826,0.3405,1.1068,1.3544,5.1742,0.0005,2.4823,0.7156,4.3624,3.4029,3.234,4.1931,2.573,2.4449,1.7628,0.1258,0.3667,4.7061,0.4211,7.1842,0.9991,0.3731,2.7434,0.795,1.3099,1.0354,4.4023,0.5528,1.7197]}

{"prompt":"A real game of Fantasy Football : where the quarterback is a wizard and stuff like that .","text":"A real game of Fantasy Football : where the quarterback is a wizard and stuff like that. I love your blog and I follow your updates!!\nI have been using my Smoothieware blender(1,000) with the blade replacement ($40) on and off for the past 13years, with some major issues. Recently a major blade broke (see pic below). Went to Smoothieware to replace, but they could only send parts out for blades (because they don\u2019t care). The \u201cblade maintenance kit\u201d they sent me only came with a brush to clean the blade. I had a major warranty issue and Smoothieware didn\u2019t cover the replacement blending blade. I have been calling the Smoothieware Customer Service team multiple times to try and get this resolved.\nThe blade I received did not fit properly and started to cut the jar. Took it back to Smoothieware, got a $49 replacement blade and I received parts to repair it and I was supposed to return it in 7days, but I never got it back and am still waiting for my warranty to kick in.","token_len":227,"entropy":[7.85,5.5929,3.4059,9.9578,2.0351,8.0085,7.1637,1.632,6.3041,1.3999,2.1864,6.1809,2.1251,9.4293,1.4111,0.0229,0.7648,3.3215,3.7908,5.5065,4.9394,1.9289,2.0484,7.1204,2.2351,3.4462,8.1162,1.4082,5.01,2.9844,2.0655,3.5284,3.5754,13.0216,9.9003,6.6844,9.759,8.1465,4.9899,4.1448,2.814,3.5717,4.464,2.4694,8.2186,9.6345,8.8944,3.9743,0.9676,3.636,4.6322,0.3942,0.6947,1.7844,0.7852,6.0837,7.6122,2.4113,4.261,3.9291,5.2551,2.5718,1.0711,6.4714,4.4653,4.7779,7.5378,5.6393,3.3575,5.0481,4.4014,1.4743,1.2765,9.6575,1.06,3.3961,0.0639,0.0009,2.1405,2.3337,3.1634,1.6931,2.9438,5.3481,4.8293,4.8866,7.0589,3.1055,2.1404,9.9467,3.6498,5.315,1.4589,2.4404,15.9312,8.1021,1.4479,4.1038,2.2736,2.9123,16.4422,6.3128,7.4794,6.6959,3.6349,5.3713,6.4011,5.3917,1.1222,1.3092,5.618,3.4811,0.8009,1.3256,6.9368,3.9556,2.3155,1.8233,0.7581,1.4511,1.5933,2.9129,2.7159,6.7897,6.6765,2.1677,2.2103,8.5296,0.0103,0.0002,3.1788,1.2439,0.4562,0.0026,4.8095,1.9372,3.8412,15.0777,5.2136,1.1059,1.5528,2.8267,2.1308,7.0382,3.673,2.7871,0.0344,0.0005,3.1134,0.2259,2.5639,6.2531,0.0071,1.5455,2.0913,0.6223,1.036,3.0498,3.145,0.8444,2.4534,2.7503,1.9235,3.6159,2.6397,4.6617,0.5589,2.4599,4.4089,2.1662,6.2635,1.4858,4.9406,3.6632,11.4251,2.1082,6.5478,0.308,2.9836,3.1626,0.6123,0.9642,0.0179,0.0008,2.8228,4.0872,1.745,5.1676,5.6955,1.2372,1.9305,1.6429,3.509,4.8162,7.7207,2.7485,3.0961,0.9161,3.3625,3.7338,2.91,7.1325,0.0032,3.3786,0.6972,3.5204,4.5821,5.7257,3.0408,0.4145,1.7726,3.911,0.8867,1.4058,1.4097,2.7668,5.327,2.1167,1.1928,0.6706,2.9113,2.5643,1.4586,6.3278,0.059,0.5221]}

{"prompt":"Incredible magical abilities , as explained by an incredibly bland college textbook","text":"Incredible magical abilities, as explained by an incredibly bland college textbook. Very nice.\nI remember this show for being one of the very few \"Dragon Ball\" cartoons the kids were allowed to watch; and, I was much more impressed with the artwork in this series than \"GF4\" and \"Dragon Ball GT\", and in fact, even more impressed with this series than this very same series.\nIt's a really nice show. As I recall, the writing of the series wasn't anything super, great, or ground-breaking, but at least it was the first show I ever saw (ever) with the Dragon Ball theme in any part of its story.\nI think it's more amazing to me that the show lasted for 9 or 10 volumes of a single series. Seems like a bad time, but after all, that's when many of us were born. Some kids would go a looong way with the series, whereas others would give it up a long time (or forever) before being able to finish it - and that's just the sort of thing that makes an anime series worth the effort.","token_len":228,"entropy":[9.2056,9.1014,4.1239,1.9024,4.328,6.3708,1.3083,4.8888,5.5368,9.7989,9.6856,5.0445,0.9607,6.7552,4.5018,1.8565,1.2521,6.4798,5.8233,4.0779,6.8795,4.4342,3.9135,2.3175,0.0626,0.5136,4.307,1.0937,4.914,9.5422,0.701,0.6788,5.3245,6.1482,4.3604,2.384,1.3323,0.1158,0.7663,5.358,3.3616,3.9288,3.0375,2.9458,6.8361,0.864,2.9841,0.9308,0.8862,4.9596,3.8587,1.8262,2.8308,0.7433,6.8876,12.3863,6.244,1.5637,2.764,0.669,1.8042,0.0374,4.1153,3.0769,3.1851,5.0582,1.2411,0.5785,3.772,2.8457,0.8108,0.8375,3.8554,1.9794,1.6454,4.6677,5.6749,5.4609,1.9604,0.9668,1.7513,3.5457,1.204,2.2897,4.1233,2.5227,1.8652,1.9013,4.9568,2.2961,3.3238,0.4975,1.6133,5.8403,3.7694,0.8906,2.103,5.0035,0.0006,4.4486,6.3381,4.6157,8.9636,1.0202,0.6765,10.3116,1.4914,0.0128,0.9455,0.7958,4.7949,0.2637,0.9188,1.3542,4.8541,2.0263,3.9587,1.2004,1.7148,1.9776,3.6685,6.9011,1.5345,3.2682,2.406,4.9018,0.2666,4.8752,3.0635,4.7334,5.3856,0.1676,3.7829,2.8403,0.5542,1.4588,2.0548,3.0726,2.0282,0.7848,4.7624,6.7159,2.0396,2.1178,0.5441,1.7652,2.2084,5.8537,2.4018,5.859,4.5698,0.4411,7.4718,2.7498,3.0305,2.4369,2.2857,2.021,8.5137,0.4461,1.5014,6.1165,3.9543,3.4487,1.6379,5.6964,2.2564,0.5973,3.3878,0.6294,4.6829,5.857,1.2615,2.2238,2.034,4.3078,0.7885,7.0786,3.6733,2.6951,3.0183,5.5941,9.1022,4.114,0.3094,0.3003,3.7592,2.3387,2.3714,0.7318,6.4736,0.9972,0.5624,5.0246,1.0312,1.7456,4.8458,2.2852,0.082,4.582,2.3816,5.3947,1.5735,2.3078,4.2118,1.0325,0.0021,4.1937,0.694,6.6442,1.7936,2.298,0.4988,2.9172,2.2198,4.8988,0.0007,0.5432,1.1843,2.828,4.2134,1.2413,3.2818,2.1165,3.6995,1.857,0.3859]}

For me it never worked and I never got to know what was going on when I died in the game. Any clue on this?\nSo I was making me some cheese balls for dinner and realized I didn\u2019t have any chopped onions. And I do have a bunch of fresh lemon rinds in the fridge, which I used in a recipe I posted recently. One of my favorite cheeses, ricotta, is also my least favorite: it\u2019s too bland to my taste. That makes it kind of a waste, but when I heard that ricotta can be a wonderful ingredient in salads, that made me want to give it another try.\nI made three dishes using ricotta for the base. The first was a tomato ricotta pesto salad. The second was a ricotta and asparagus salad. And the third was an arugula ricotta basil dressing that was wonderful on grilled chicken.","token_len":228,"entropy":[3.8043,7.1523,0.5849,1.1333,6.0036,1.9327,6.7476,8.105,9.0645,9.4993,3.6288,2.7833,4.589,1.6749,5.0588,8.1189,3.9181,9.4004,3.176,10.8732,7.0229,0.3234,5.1059,3.6616,1.3013,2.8751,1.3172,7.4225,2.4209,5.9081,3.4895,3.2002,1.9426,3.227,1.7087,0.5116,0.8804,1.379,5.9087,2.4436,1.919,6.5152,4.7441,3.2022,0.9684,2.955,2.2183,1.8004,3.962,1.5314,1.8169,0.5789,0.2355,4.6821,0.4246,0.7091,4.8131,1.4698,1.7055,0.4869,6.0879,5.3088,2.904,2.89,0.8123,0.7321,4.056,1.6661,3.1,6.2668,6.2563,3.0891,8.7137,6.0164,3.3796,3.6017,1.1507,6.169,1.3475,3.1075,15.0632,6.7786,1.461,1.6583,1.3826,12.5191,2.2645,1.5606,3.4375,1.3378,6.4465,1.0041,1.6303,3.7586,0.1201,4.9731,6.0554,5.4697,0.1481,0.3307,2.7759,1.6139,0.6875,2.7687,2.5391,0.9988,3.4088,3.1323,3.4509,2.6062,2.0072,3.0659,4.9873,0.7211,5.8086,0.675,1.71,2.068,3.9343,0.1115,2.7169,7.008,0.015,0.6592,0.9418,3.0702,3.8715,6.2357,0.0727,6.071,2.8995,5.9828,0.1598,0.0933,4.3921,4.7352,1.8719,5.2628,0.2218,0.7995,5.0055,3.6579,0.9882,4.2543,0.0044,2.4613,4.3749,3.6836,1.257,4.3534,0.7494,5.9296,1.7506,3.0985,0.0068,5.0186,0.6056,3.3578,4.4205,3.0045,1.1042,4.4905,0.595,4.4594,2.5149,0.2535,2.0466,0.081,4.1612,0.186,3.9093,0.4762,0.2696,1.1622,1.7757,3.5967,4.8138,6.6888,3.7185,1.2164,0.0019,3.8951,1.712,5.723,1.9115,1.727,0.3397,0.9106,1.192,4.3552,4.5854,0.0025,6.5386,0.0022,3.8656,1.3731,1.2565,0.311,0.4792,0.592,3.615,0.0012,4.4499,7.2907,0.6723,0.0002,0.811,0.5861,2.9746,0.5749,0.2345,0.3855,3.4537,4.1922,0.0312,0.001,2.4176,0.0042,6.0108,4.4624,3.5963,1.5978,7.869,3.0424,5.0362,3.2516,0.8615]}
{"prompt":"Give me 1,000 words worth 1 picture .","text":"Give me 1,000 words worth 1 picture. Can you do it?\nThere are a lot of articles about building an image library, but I have never heard of building a word library. However, building a word library was a primary objective for the first year of my graduate education because, as I have been learning, an author, the word or text, and the reader\u2019s image, all fit together very neatly. The more I reflect, the more obvious it is that the image library must be made available to the text library in order for the word picture to form a whole.\nIn the final week, for a week, I wrote a poem (I do this every year at the end of my graduate program for a few hours per day), with the poem\u2019s words forming the word picture. One day, the poetry image became the image of the world. The poem became an image of the world and the world became the poem. That would never have happened if I was not taking care of the image library I was keeping for the reader and writing a poem, which became the image of the world.","token_len":228,"entropy":[5.5456,6.5563,2.4654,0.4458,3.3608,6.3912,9.2491,8.4271,1.9041,5.8724,0.657,3.5162,1.0115,0.9964,1.5882,8.9802,1.054,2.259,0.8785,0.0479,6.6235,2.1539,7.5809,3.6493,3.6461,7.1219,1.8792,0.9456,1.6432,3.4194,2.5878,2.9444,0.2016,3.8876,1.1421,5.5703,0.9109,0.6917,5.4134,0.0993,5.4552,0.5042,0.392,0.0705,3.9376,1.9442,7.2478,4.4896,1.3324,2.667,2.6991,3.0906,0.7551,0.8471,4.4547,3.2052,5.5732,4.2133,1.7846,1.2405,3.4411,3.3641,3.4819,1.6193,6.6676,5.0124,3.5929,5.1876,3.9703,7.0309,4.8232,2.4993,3.1599,1.2259,3.8723,13.9781,7.174,4.3577,6.8282,0.9942,3.7628,6.8189,1.1333,4.1163,3.1468,0.8763,2.8159,4.7943,1.8797,9.5113,2.8071,0.1991,0.3652,6.4241,1.1013,1.9811,0.5058,2.0788,2.7207,2.4522,4.051,0.5862,4.905,3.6995,0.9002,1.622,6.3766,5.4881,3.4815,0.6022,1.7819,1.416,3.4776,6.8241,0.1933,5.2355,1.8432,3.9074,0.3378,1.3155,3.1618,1.8255,5.3052,5.7111,2.7622,5.7629,3.107,3.3936,1.7355,0.5188,3.7123,1.4101,6.1655,3.9723,2.698,4.6963,3.0417,2.5108,2.3785,3.4495,1.5027,2.7846,0.0105,1.5775,2.183,2.0047,4.7194,2.5511,2.9782,4.4443,3.9124,1.113,2.0386,4.1146,1.6468,4.9112,8.6729,0.4343,0.5428,3.1636,7.6149,1.2063,4.3165,0.6397,0.7333,4.9441,1.1573,0.7685,2.8057,6.2254,9.2162,3.1744,2.0318,2.8827,1.1268,0.6151,6.0201,1.1382,1.7461,1.7158,3.2493,3.2769,1.2088,0.5566,0.8618,0.6069,2.826,1.2461,1.7353,1.3105,1.2786,1.798,0.5053,4.3057,4.9957,5.6324,2.0687,0.3867,0.9441,1.2287,3.4854,1.8401,5.3109,4.2643,0.1783,0.9709,2.5753,2.3103,6.9884,1.6169,6.095,2.3864,1.8506,5.9039,3.0393,2.754,2.2768,0.5416,2.9872,2.6661,4.8208,0.8997,1.7012,0.2299,0.2471,0.2105,0.5199]}

You can fly to a number of places like the great pyramid of Giza or ancient ruins in Mexico. And, by the way, the camera angle and physics to fly around are fantastic. When you come across an obstacle in the game, there is a blue area around it that when you go around that you can go around at whatever angle you want. Nice little feature because it allows you to see it from different views. I have yet to discover a single enemy in this game. Which is one interesting aspect I like a lot. It's almost like a real time strategy game. I will never forget seeing those stone age people, sitting in their caves, using those metal balls with ancient technology on them to create the world from nothing. This game is amazing.

That\u2019s basically the best they can do in a single episode with only 9. The rest of the episode is pretty lame and I think they need to start getting someone else to write for this show. While the plot is a bit odd for a superhero show it\u2019s still pretty good! I\u2019m very looking forward to see what else they can do.\nThe art for the issue is pretty good, with some very cool backgrounds and panel layouts. Some of the colors and contrast are a little too dark for the story as it is, but it\u2019s still very good. The panel layouts themselves are very nice and the art isn\u2019t cluttered overly. The coloring is very nice as well! I\u2019m very looking forward to seeing what else they are able to get done with this series. Overall review I give this issue a solid 7.5!

In another blog, I have written about what to expect when the virus spreads to other parts of the world because we are still very new to these kind of pathogens.","token_len":235,"entropy":[11.45,0.5148,1.8256,8.2901,5.962,4.6086,6.1085,0.0262,3.9245,5.7886,4.6331,2.5759,4.6071,13.6569,5.7878,2.0562,7.2391,2.4955,0.9369,5.0894,1.4741,3.7849,0.1211,2.4789,4.4944,1.2118,5.5426,3.513,2.4499,0.6318,4.0319,3.0865,6.559,1.2661,3.7871,3.6468,3.1846,0.9533,5.4448,1.7227,4.6491,2.5647,3.0612,2.2458,3.1658,4.9521,0.268,4.7747,0.9024,0.0228,0.477,6.2799,16.2217,8.6188,2.354,4.0034,1.2806,4.7303,2.6209,5.6247,0.8651,4.5149,3.6987,3.9343,2.9142,0.695,2.1867,1.8988,3.0303,5.1193,0.0544,4.2122,1.3669,4.5805,0.4921,2.5434,10.4762,0.4443,3.8289,5.3038,3.5518,1.5518,0.2664,3.6611,3.8107,0.2358,10.8156,10.3413,11.4732,1.0652,1.2072,11.3056,0.5945,1.6221,1.0753,0.0447,4.151,2.306,0.1391,0.0895,3.6421,4.4324,3.5783,2.9831,2.2419,5.2808,1.1124,4.4702,5.7688,8.9836,0.103,1.1995,0.827,2.6587,8.6395,1.2623,3.7661,5.3754,1.3226,2.7081,4.0769,3.3745,4.9793,3.8369,8.8918,0.1076,7.7439,5.5657,6.3251,1.5106,9.7612,5.5414,4.2086,1.6499,2.7391,3.1208,3.0593,5.162,1.2116,4.1764,0.0127,9.9599,1.1823,3.0936,0.4001,3.2268,2.4951,1.389,3.7794,1.236,0.2684,5.392,1.1365,2.8912,3.7471,8.8735,0.0127,0.0207,6.0326,1.2588,1.0414,6.7214,1.4093,0.7105,5.0097,0.003,0.2615,0.2459,0.2952,3.6265,2.6692,2.3867,2.1906,6.4542,7.7591,2.7112,1.9274,6.8022,0.0739,1.4254,3.1057,0.7355,5.0071,1.8063,0.7478,2.8594,2.111,6.6387,2.2517,2.5259,0.6157,2.4472,0.1308,2.806,1.6855,0.7025,1.3935,2.6806,6.7085,3.3975,1.1117,3.3285,6.6135,5.1951,4.1723,0.8183,3.5826,3.0043,0.3205,4.2239,3.4533,2.2688,1.8417,2.4429,1.0645,3.1136,1.7885,2.0287,2.4025,0.005,0.0714,0.0856,5.2373,2.6351,1.6046,3.8286,3.733,5.1045,0.5181,4.0249,6.4631,0.0113,5.6323,0.4897]}

{"prompt":"New pills can temporarily release a person 's dormant superpowers , but with great power comes great lists of possible side effects .","text":"New pills can temporarily release a person's dormant superpowers, but with great power comes great lists of possible side effects. These pills can interact with other medications and can even induce the dormition of a person's existing abilities. As of February of 2011, the only pills that have received FDA approval as a means of super power dormancy, are Psilocybin and LSD.

The Grandfather Paradox (or Grandfather's Clock) is a phenomenon in which time is perceived to be slowning down by the living when the dead are brought home to have their bodies reinterred.\nOn the surface, a person dying has nothing to do with time. The thing is that time can only be observed by living things.\nThis can be seen as an experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the body's immune system when it comes to a dead person. This paradox is named after the film The Grandfather Paradox (), when the dead man\u2019s last word to his granddaughter is \"Grandfather clock, keep going\".\n\u201c Grandfather Clock\u201d is a title given to those who are in their latter years and live a very happy and fulfilled life.\nIn this case, the reference was to a clock, but the name has been extended to other concepts. People with a grandparent clock are people who have lived their lives in a good and fulfilled way, with little or no regret over the choices they have made.","token_len":236,"entropy":[12.2102,8.693,2.4569,2.8693,0.1291,1.0346,7.7974,0.1772,5.6756,2.668,9.6831,2.4531,9.1304,1.8327,1.5745,0.0373,5.2513,3.6554,7.8936,0.8014,0.5547,6.6704,4.7601,6.1207,1.9373,0.0181,0.0423,3.5897,4.7939,3.5404,0.5852,2.7616,6.8583,0.4795,0.9666,0.5508,7.3945,1.9011,0.4301,3.0185,1.7157,6.2278,1.2239,0.8135,8.2412,2.6549,14.384,4.1532,2.4852,1.5489,6.5449,7.1835,2.3157,3.9519,0.9842,5.5201,5.4009,2.5294,6.7536,1.8851,3.5018,3.7679,4.8479,0.0113,0.755,2.7057,11.6806,1.1985,3.4827,0.348,3.6411,4.1429,6.4741,4.7138,4.5704,0.2061,0.2792,0.0136,2.113,1.3175,2.5058,5.9739,1.3219,1.2506,1.6446,3.5661,4.6948,0.6068,4.5289,2.3015,2.6446,3.2823,1.0463,3.0354,3.4174,4.0054,0.6548,1.1752,2.8111,2.5566,5.9451,2.7042,6.2816,0.955,5.3418,0.0897,2.6462,7.2727,1.4728,6.0954,0.1061,3.9523,1.7459,1.5622,0.0395,3.7269,4.4678,0.7304,0.9723,3.4248,7.6144,1.2607,6.6086,1.1069,1.1452,6.3513,2.4316,2.1714,0.0597,0.1779,11.6846,4.6308,1.5912,2.9639,2.991,15.1902,8.2038,1.3292,6.5804,5.7421,3.2785,1.5107,7.0915,1.4238,1.3964,6.5288,0.3465,7.7522,4.8306,7.2162,3.2538,2.018,0.8048,7.0816,5.8934,5.5404,0.0543,0.8836,4.408,7.3225,1.7789,0.9739,7.0164,1.5749,0.1757,5.355,0.405,2.7305,3.776,3.9542,9.4209,2.3695,2.315,4.9333,3.8736,2.8799,3.3949,1.8957,3.3003,0.0631,0.2936,1.5927,3.1186,3.3042,2.9628,0.1738,1.1887,7.4428,5.1267,0.4313,1.7329,4.7069,2.5881,2.3159,1.7452,4.0616,4.1378,1.4213,4.358,0.2911,2.8934,4.6112,2.1903,7.1027,3.1459,2.0747,2.7112,2.4925,1.5257,1.804,4.3301,0.4299,1.7429,2.9221,2.4045,1.7264,1.8459,1.3506,5.301,1.2542,3.2971,1.728,1.3997,3.2728,4.1451,1.1527,0.0647,4.2608,4.4686,2.1568,4.5794,0.3019,1.6662,0.0815,0.5455]}

{"prompt":"The story of a pair of military boots , told from the perspective of the boots","text":"The story of a pair of military boots, told from the perspective of the boots themselves, the ones who walked in and out of service in Vietnam. As the story unfolds, we learn about the man who made the boots, who made the buttons, and who wore the boots from the Vietnam War to the Iraq war; and the woman, an air force psychologist, whose job it was to help soldiers understand the psychic damage inflicted on them by their boots. In The Man Who Came Back From the War to Find His Boots, a novel about Vietnam and the psyche of the American soldier written as a love letter to all those who have served in the war, author Brian Aldiss uses the boots of an army soldier for an unforgettably poignant meditation on the human condition. When the author interviewed his fellow soldiers for this book, it occurred to him that they were all a bit ashamed of the boots they had worn in Vietnam. For most of them, that shame is what the military boots did to the human psyche. This is a great book that makes you ask a lot of serious questions about the war itself--and about what makes most of us who have served in it so angry.","token_len":238,"entropy":[6.9031,1.4961,3.5914,6.497,0.1557,7.0752,7.4445,2.705,9.3014,2.3611,1.0803,1.4519,0.0045,2.1221,7.5623,2.5297,0.227,4.8853,7.4806,5.3474,6.0262,2.7523,2.115,0.38,0.2849,5.3238,2.9001,3.8873,1.923,4.7237,1.8664,1.8034,2.5634,0.2418,2.2236,1.4624,2.4132,0.8622,5.0813,0.5494,4.1601,1.3468,1.0676,0.9669,2.1041,3.8154,1.4816,10.3102,0.7569,1.3607,1.0213,4.9149,1.946,1.0048,5.4167,0.9633,6.2489,1.191,2.1168,0.8976,3.9668,1.3281,5.349,1.8477,1.6981,3.9341,4.6179,5.8803,5.4177,1.8636,6.8858,1.388,3.8802,3.0847,1.1845,0.7008,0.0446,1.7283,3.2335,3.2357,1.3656,10.4885,5.2595,3.8542,1.054,1.0794,0.693,1.6203,1.7474,0.4438,3.6479,4.6976,4.195,0.4938,4.9761,1.0749,3.6688,0.8972,2.7567,5.4977,4.3412,1.723,3.3022,0.3023,3.7194,4.5472,1.3584,3.9523,2.2271,1.3142,5.0311,0.4657,1.6545,2.497,0.616,7.889,4.2879,0.5131,5.9702,1.2962,0.2283,5.373,1.5119,0.5561,2.6474,1.6732,1.4543,1.0285,1.4208,0.4034,6.0617,5.977,5.5834,0.0804,5.4499,1.0361,3.8392,2.083,4.6751,4.9032,5.4284,4.7107,2.349,10.0639,3.3556,0.0487,0.0174,3.1951,4.8257,0.1007,0.7957,4.3669,1.5888,0.6875,5.2596,1.484,5.6839,6.8686,3.7711,3.2972,1.1856,2.8109,1.7648,0.5347,0.1891,3.6868,5.9441,0.0185,0.5984,0.2956,1.9399,1.1283,2.6528,5.4666,1.5566,6.8107,0.4862,2.0833,1.4046,1.2,1.1764,0.7359,2.387,1.0816,0.7721,4.6405,4.3105,0.513,1.3732,0.1567,3.2874,5.8606,2.2695,3.7425,4.2441,3.6422,1.1841,3.1422,1.074,4.3332,4.364,1.2495,0.6251,4.1498,1.6148,1.5032,4.439,1.0535,2.6283,4.2348,2.1951,5.0203,4.0899,1.4782,0.1638,6.945,0.0226,0.5604,0.8666,3.0386,3.5087,5.8181,1.9423,2.3542,2.7151,3.7817,7.7578,1.2198,0.6136,3.1619,2.0561,0.68,0.5315,0.9751,2.5244,3.2818,0.9611]}

If you like to tell stories or you have a very visual imagination, then there's no doubt that lamp writing is a great way to give you an idea... A lamp is so magical because it can transport you out of reality when you read through it and make you question some unpleasant aspects from your life. You have to live in the light, and also see the shadows that surround you. How do you do it best? What is the best way to start a story like this? How can you incorporate your imagination into something that is real? As always, we at Designing the Way know what to say : use a lamp ( or some other object that has a special place in your imagination ) as a symbol of what you want to express.

Maybe that wasn\u2019t blinking that you remember but maybe it was an animal that blinked at that instant. There are also a lot of blinks caused by light during the day and light at night. We all have to learn to become aware that this happens and that when it happens we don\u2019t have to assume that it is always something good or even the result of spiritual healing.

{"prompt":"-and then the acid kicked in .","text":"-and then the acid kicked in. I couldn't get it out!\nWell, in the long run we decided to find a new solution. After a few weeks, we found a company that had exactly the necessary solution at the beginning of the first week of February.\nOnce again, we asked for price quotes. As it was necessary to change the whole tank, we decided that we would have a new tank, too, since in some cases it was not possible to remove the old one. This turned out to be a very easy solution, with little maintenance. The price quote was around \u20ac800, and we decided to go for it.\nSince the old tanks are still in the attic, we have to wait until they are removed prior to replacing them. This took some time, since the attic is difficult to access, but we finally received the new tanks from the company. So far, it seems that the new tanks are a little smaller (we only know this by way of the invoice), but everything works fine so far.\nIn short: in the end we have to find a solution for our kitchen. Not with this project, but a solution that makes all the difference.","token_len":241,"entropy":[5.9607,7.4386,3.0513,10.4453,6.4688,0.2285,0.7457,2.5705,4.2796,0.0005,2.9998,2.1334,0.9945,5.3057,2.0355,8.4578,0.3706,4.7534,1.5063,4.9681,0.2198,4.601,5.3722,0.6515,5.1736,0.929,2.4603,3.7501,1.0846,4.38,2.0593,1.6205,1.9755,1.7596,0.9679,1.7197,1.3512,6.662,1.2295,2.2459,7.3593,0.7019,6.5133,5.9904,6.3224,1.7451,5.3176,0.6831,0.6152,5.0351,2.8503,1.6054,3.7145,0.6358,2.3652,6.0415,3.19,0.4418,1.401,5.1428,2.1203,8.8626,3.3677,1.6362,4.6804,3.0747,3.048,6.9612,0.9093,5.8175,0.8714,6.3045,7.6617,1.3556,0.5447,2.2285,2.5888,1.1945,0.8644,3.0007,3.8867,3.1744,1.7046,3.0011,5.2436,1.6209,3.8756,5.64,4.721,0.9426,2.0043,1.4165,2.5471,1.3336,0.1097,4.4819,0.5,4.3236,1.5511,1.0269,3.4405,4.9326,0.0276,0.0521,0.0318,1.3103,2.0636,3.3922,2.618,1.7285,4.8214,3.9786,3.8913,1.0755,2.7297,3.737,3.4991,0.9691,4.3218,4.1209,4.7297,1.362,1.5385,1.495,3.2902,0.2619,3.048,1.227,0.6643,0.8227,0.7371,5.0547,1.749,4.4282,3.3812,2.209,2.5919,1.6784,1.7019,8.0781,0.4081,0.5151,3.9113,1.2824,3.562,1.4964,3.3947,0.5559,4.6604,7.2518,0.0035,4.8532,0.268,0.3544,2.9914,4.1334,2.3834,0.4163,0.6498,2.3063,1.7434,3.261,1.1249,6.1136,0.1346,2.8543,1.4113,1.2049,1.1911,2.836,5.1248,1.6951,3.1991,2.1845,2.972,1.2424,2.173,1.002,4.5827,1.95,0.5286,2.4957,2.2156,0.6357,1.2317,1.7592,0.7291,0.7917,4.1517,2.6016,4.481,4.6345,5.1943,3.0652,6.8185,5.2644,3.1234,6.1289,0.0049,1.5493,8.5923,1.9408,0.6018,6.5395,3.8309,2.0517,4.8976,0.0276,0.2535,0.5724,3.6458,3.5599,2.5129,5.3732,1.4847,1.5143,2.0472,2.5776,3.3027,3.9412,0.4949,2.2959,1.5992,2.1627,7.9285,1.8389,5.7518,6.4594,3.3151,5.1269,0.4378,0.4866,4.7805,2.083,1.3068,4.3077,4.2567,0.8138,0.2192,1.0302]}

Everyone in the galaxy is pretty pissed because Earth just skipped a couple hundred years of development. The Earth\u2019s government decided that it should be the first to be able to make contact with other worlds because it is closer to Earth. Therefore, the Earth is in the beginning. Now, the Galaxy is following the same development cycle as the Earth. The Galaxy will start at the beginning and slowly move further to the end. Soon all the planets in the Galaxy will be in the advanced technology society phase like the Earth.\nThere will be a lot of changes when the Earth is in the advanced technology society. The Earth will have different kinds of energy sources that are renewable energy sources that will never run out of power. For example, if the Earth is in the advanced technology society, a windmill that uses natural energy from the wind to turn the blades of a turbine will be able to provide electricity to the Earth\u2019s people. Therefore, the development in the advanced technology society will make life very comfortable. It is also good for the environment. The Earth\u2019s environment will become more environmentally friendly.","token_len":243,"entropy":[6.8053,9.0998,5.0754,1.1811,5.8669,7.8,2.7407,4.2285,4.4207,3.085,1.1835,5.7382,1.5551,2.4091,7.6017,1.4799,3.4984,2.4481,1.008,7.3687,3.2313,0.7495,3.4326,1.4421,6.281,7.0915,5.4379,6.0001,5.3955,7.4239,2.9404,4.7359,4.163,0.6481,1.4851,2.4311,1.1939,2.7721,4.0366,15.575,8.6186,2.3974,4.7371,4.5492,1.7194,2.2464,3.8815,2.3308,3.7828,2.5903,1.3812,4.0386,2.2666,0.0104,3.8615,4.4472,0.2526,1.6219,1.052,4.4825,1.369,2.8362,6.9678,0.224,1.8473,1.8962,5.8117,0.4084,1.7181,1.2825,2.3293,4.0765,1.7662,5.0295,3.8378,4.4175,0.9532,1.9628,7.182,1.1624,7.3417,1.9236,1.6365,6.1105,4.6943,1.1771,1.3009,1.2312,0.7535,1.9189,3.0975,3.6222,3.8406,3.8713,1.2328,1.264,2.1186,4.2081,2.7605,4.8041,3.2824,0.6637,1.3643,0.4491,5.0307,4.1198,1.3084,1.3164,2.2547,0.1257,1.194,0.2836,1.0181,2.8508,1.0158,6.8604,3.8879,7.6664,6.6061,6.0598,1.0874,1.0673,0.6574,3.0625,6.197,1.6911,0.2507,1.5216,2.3132,0.117,3.6887,4.815,0.7507,1.5154,1.5306,1.9267,0.3923,0.9803,0.4401,1.21,2.4157,1.4851,1.5675,0.7387,2.6472,4.4661,4.3835,0.0045,3.7889,1.9739,3.2234,2.0266,7.1612,4.8595,2.2098,3.0974,2.1793,5.584,3.3755,0.0783,1.3792,1.4959,0.6318,4.5083,0.5021,0.0727,2.9878,1.3801,0.8095,1.2939,1.7982,0.5945,0.4273,0.1485,0.146,1.584,4.4415,4.8982,3.9179,3.3956,3.3629,3.5635,2.5352,4.286,0.6797,2.3775,4.347,4.8697,2.0524,7.0159,0.7515,1.4041,2.7036,0.6456,1.7717,1.973,0.0051,4.3836,1.2481,1.0311,0.5522,1.2718,8.0424,0.2704,1.6782,2.8304,0.5389,4.9489,0.0961,0.883,5.9098,4.4916,0.602,0.4989,0.1189,0.0716,0.4386,4.9909,4.3779,4.2954,4.3253,1.9528,3.5665,1.9908,2.5669,4.2586,1.3416,1.0027,3.0165,1.3885,1.6871,1.5323,4.8311,0.0234,0.0211,3.0881,0.7552,3.0182,1.6455,5.1739,0.3887,1.013]}
{"prompt":"Santa and Death both arrive at a young child 's house at the same time .","text":"Santa and Death both arrive at a young child's house at the same time. Sister Santa says she had wanted to spend the holidays with the boy, but he was very sick with an ailment and she can not go. Sister Death, on the other hand, is invited. The boy, who is the first to arrive in the house, is surprised when he finds no gift in his hand. Sister Death tells him that he still has a year and that it is the time when all good people and loved ones go to a higher world. And the boy, who was very ill, died.\nIt is good to see that a novel, which I think has been overburdened with literary criticism, is nevertheless an interesting book. In the first chapter, the author presents some myths and legends of the northern countries. The main thing to me was that the story is about the boy, not her, who is the narrator. (But he is a little confused by this and makes a mistake several times in the narration). The book is filled with descriptions of the landscape \u2013 of forests and moors. The pictures are very vivid. The descriptions of the characters, though not very many, have sufficient information.","token_len":244,"entropy":[4.1072,9.402,8.8762,7.7434,1.2811,3.248,5.1553,4.7448,1.1581,2.4932,3.7569,1.444,2.3789,0.0535,0.6972,8.67,8.1001,4.6347,1.5855,4.1651,5.2782,0.1952,5.0595,1.0246,4.784,0.5177,2.1811,2.528,1.169,0.6934,2.324,2.4459,4.789,3.7375,4.1442,3.0992,4.4776,0.0002,2.2115,2.1128,7.2841,4.0277,2.7295,2.4003,2.6914,2.1754,3.8571,2.0517,0.1177,0.013,0.001,0.0352,1.7441,6.8858,4.198,2.7362,1.951,3.0782,1.6164,0.9096,4.5499,3.6597,1.1557,1.1368,3.7903,0.8019,0.5498,0.2306,1.3071,4.5821,1.9902,0.86,1.6578,4.8127,7.1918,2.7899,1.0989,2.5477,0.4671,2.4084,0.2168,2.467,0.9638,0.8765,1.6751,6.2539,0.761,1.4919,5.213,3.9305,3.2008,3.0732,0.9822,3.7078,2.7994,4.1728,4.5777,6.8935,2.4333,4.4894,6.5579,0.0052,4.7223,0.7239,4.0761,8.0095,4.8909,0.4866,5.44,3.0372,1.1739,2.2454,1.1048,2.7496,3.5167,2.5877,0.5617,5.795,2.0306,1.5127,7.0914,0.6921,7.1087,0.8176,0.9963,1.1801,3.937,7.0847,3.3428,3.116,3.3441,3.0989,2.8313,2.0609,6.6495,7.6869,0.0213,0.0047,1.3026,5.7029,3.8141,0.7132,1.4166,8.0074,4.0776,2.4284,3.1122,0.6163,3.4666,1.7867,2.4136,1.8315,0.8059,2.0543,2.8517,4.1684,4.157,8.7349,1.5541,0.933,2.0448,0.9295,7.5734,4.5108,1.2832,1.7227,3.9574,4.7575,2.1995,6.4818,3.19,0.8229,1.2647,2.9971,1.8408,2.9738,1.6064,5.6705,1.9733,2.9196,8.272,1.7227,2.2304,1.5003,2.9824,6.6818,0.9259,6.2283,5.1265,3.7225,0.9831,2.5503,3.3426,5.185,2.1944,1.4248,2.8118,4.914,1.3926,2.1885,8.3577,0.0635,2.0476,0.9669,4.7503,3.6429,1.7202,2.7746,1.4924,3.9163,0.0172,5.5062,0.2516,1.4569,7.6975,6.7008,3.7999,4.4123,1.5257,9.0843,0.7312,2.3824,1.6253,6.5039,1.2839,2.748,2.4644,1.4304,1.2136,4.1361,1.2518,0.8304,4.8294,2.7967,3.7496,2.908,3.1549,5.5905,0.1828,3.7569,7.4242,3.1337,2.5249]}

He was telling me that in my old work I was doing more business than writing, but somehow I still find it all difficult. My advice to him was to slow down and take time to write more, and in particular he was asking me to write more fiction. The problem is, I often find I am writing the same thing over and over. Somehow I just don't seem to be able to think of anything fresh and enjoyable to say. I don't mind writing business books, but the work I get asked for is almost all very similar and I'm not sure it's worth it. Not sure of what I have been doing to be able to write so much in so short a time, but my wife thinks I'm still busy.","token_len":247,"entropy":[8.9194,2.6923,3.2521,6.4024,0.4181,5.8403,4.0337,1.7859,6.7272,7.9665,4.4699,0.7854,0.1838,2.2055,10.1021,13.8011,5.2015,2.8457,5.9813,2.6204,4.615,1.1903,2.9216,4.921,2.1991,6.7084,1.8096,1.6428,7.1621,0.7248,1.061,3.9621,2.6696,4.3772,6.0219,0.7063,5.1218,3.4952,6.1194,2.5067,0.8219,0.3239,0.5514,3.599,1.0453,3.6522,2.0126,3.0036,0.552,1.5868,4.8718,1.9368,1.1037,6.3757,2.0782,2.4632,2.4712,8.226,0.0013,1.4442,1.3822,0.2402,2.1034,3.1481,1.7974,4.2807,0.3619,1.2741,2.2747,2.2807,0.7401,4.3227,3.2084,2.5795,2.4278,2.882,1.2324,5.2221,3.2506,4.4995,6.3322,3.1512,4.3627,2.468,1.445,2.5705,3.0492,3.9243,4.6732,0.3303,5.2184,9.0651,8.388,2.3754,15.1729,1.82,2.0103,1.1959,1.7039,6.5638,0.1817,1.1231,3.8754,3.7916,4.5272,4.9369,2.2378,2.6162,3.7307,5.8045,6.6948,1.0666,5.1319,2.122,2.9254,6.1568,1.175,3.2131,5.5321,1.0929,6.1591,4.3944,1.9432,4.0403,6.6392,1.1791,1.2249,0.6605,1.1639,8.0325,0.119,1.0166,3.7353,3.6021,0.6229,3.329,4.4996,2.6318,1.7436,4.4823,4.4499,3.7296,2.6301,3.6266,0.5901,0.8281,1.2955,1.8911,4.4401,0.7469,3.6916,2.7284,1.2571,1.4345,1.3687,5.6775,2.641,4.5726,1.4807,2.026,4.5265,1.3176,1.7127,1.195,0.0205,0.0006,1.7346,7.8977,0.9176,4.4853,1.9231,0.0025,3.4183,0.096,2.2222,0.99,0.0038,3.9399,1.6824,1.9758,7.2722,2.1274,6.0566,1.264,2.5226,0.6638,1.5984,3.5312,0.0019,5.7811,1.0305,8.752,2.6522,1.0784,0.9642,3.6189,4.8625,1.2823,5.9135,4.2652,3.7781,1.0107,4.5748,3.1754,4.9789,5.5872,3.6103,2.4604,3.3683,1.7738,0.9958,3.7868,1.2719,2.0273,1.2596,0.4727,6.1431,4.453,4.712,2.2374,1.2,4.2669,3.6159,0.9676,3.5979,3.688,1.7046,0.0028,1.3346,5.0916,1.047,3.7958,2.3432,1.1998,0.2478,0.0759,2.0071,0.6118,4.5828,4.1267,4.857,0.9887,1.3362,5.0132,4.842,0.906]}

What happens in this play is that the lovers play games with death, often getting caught up and committing suicide, only to be reborn in another reality. In each reincarnation, they\u2019re faced with the same dilemma and must decide: Die or live, or live or die. Is it possible? The answer is yes.\nThe Death of a Salesman is a one man play written by Samuel Beckett. In the year 1962, it was staged for the first time at Drakkar Noir (New York). The play is about a man who cannot sell a car to a particular woman \u2013 because he hasn\u2019t been dating her. This woman, played by Judith Anderson, does not want him to get married or for him to have a family. He can\u2019t tell her the truth. He\u2019s just a salesman not a husband and he can\u2019t say that. The play is set in 1969 \u2013 a time when the social issues that are discussed in it are very real. The play ends in a series of absurd circumstances, where the man is trapped in an endless loop of trying to sell the car.","token_len":247,"entropy":[12.1393,8.3664,9.2754,0.8046,0.0063,4.4321,4.0806,0.0048,0.7001,3.5664,7.7689,0.9622,0.0047,5.3367,1.0275,4.8511,3.5088,3.4617,2.2104,6.6799,1.1228,2.1632,1.7246,3.9017,6.2231,4.8646,2.4307,8.2772,1.3415,4.6548,5.2178,3.8285,0.7245,4.4819,5.8597,1.0186,2.5029,4.5561,0.1012,2.0311,4.7903,1.6903,3.1925,5.5043,1.0061,2.9934,4.929,6.1928,0.1407,0.3642,2.0849,19.2771,8.8978,3.1061,5.913,0.0798,1.6604,1.7745,2.1412,3.7128,4.3599,1.4287,4.6077,8.3341,1.0755,2.9629,2.1675,1.1607,3.7961,2.5225,0.0697,0.3853,5.7265,1.4585,2.0434,3.4727,3.0544,1.3152,0.736,1.2924,0.9361,1.7983,6.266,6.2319,1.3272,3.7097,9.1058,0.2694,2.2289,1.0835,5.8503,3.778,3.4966,5.9994,0.329,7.0505,4.3001,0.0038,1.1398,3.5772,1.4983,5.4747,6.1507,0.3163,4.098,0.8421,7.4669,3.3742,0.8119,2.2605,0.115,1.7921,11.3929,1.6964,2.0316,10.1008,4.5344,4.8789,0.2945,3.0541,1.5184,0.7999,1.6525,2.8242,0.9447,1.4795,0.8643,6.4506,4.4004,2.4625,4.0641,2.1913,1.1407,7.7566,4.2587,6.1084,3.6495,1.0824,5.3756,3.5962,0.7299,0.1711,3.0331,8.2838,1.5026,1.5996,3.8077,4.4868,1.8108,5.0859,0.0404,6.6227,5.8454,0.3451,5.6266,0.4249,1.811,2.2904,0.4277,3.7516,0.9885,3.4427,6.5486,1.6809,0.0214,1.9547,1.789,2.7495,0.5732,2.5942,3.9766,5.3935,0.0676,0.0323,4.9482,0.5145,2.9722,0.9982,1.5958,2.1972,3.2129,0.0572,0.6657,3.4381,1.4263,2.5911,7.3614,1.3073,5.5586,2.7921,2.439,2.6042,0.3107,0.011,0.0162,4.166,2.0416,2.8209,2.4231,0.9161,1.2289,3.5688,0.4153,7.1951,5.0769,2.6254,3.0835,0.438,1.6805,6.3894,4.779,2.4705,2.8585,5.7773,0.7804,6.3707,1.5074,3.6571,2.1699,0.7582,1.7508,1.5115,4.7673,2.7319,1.3127,5.5196,0.0044,6.8852,5.1256,1.4794,3.0249,0.941,2.6353,2.1175,4.4924,0.5904,2.4978,3.6094,3.3982,0.4659,5.5913,0.1031,2.1364,2.3565,1.0569,2.2362]}

{"prompt":"A hostage situation takes place . However the hostage takers demands are bizarrely trivial .","text":"A hostage situation takes place. However the hostage takers demands are bizarrely trivial. They want to know how the CIA handles its finances. At first CIA director Robert Gates just laughed off the request, but after a few weeks the CIA made the payments requested and in the process ended up spending millions of dollars.\nWhen the incident with the hostages began, they were asked not to report until after a certain amount of money had been spent. This money was supposed to come from the US embassy. However since nobody was aware of the exact amount required for the payout, money from other sources kept being spent by the government.\nThe people holding the hostages had apparently been told not to talk about the amounts spent. However the news station CBS ran a report on the incident and the people did speak. They claimed that they thought the hostages were playing a game. It is unlikely that CIA agents were involved in the kidnapping itself. However the CIA had money they could have spent. It is also unlikely that a hostage holding situation would happen at a time when the world watch is on the US.\nHowever the news is not all bad for the CIA. It is likely that it got a good public relations boost as a result of this incident.","token_len":247,"entropy":[12.0875,2.5828,7.1175,0.586,2.2556,5.8462,4.228,3.894,5.5568,1.0142,11.9621,8.1856,11.0638,2.3546,6.8131,1.2123,2.8175,3.6163,0.7365,2.3954,2.0726,1.8414,4.8439,5.9959,3.512,7.0272,1.2457,5.3107,2.3939,6.9054,5.1665,3.7365,1.0635,6.1747,4.0283,2.7397,0.4983,5.0888,1.6033,1.6109,2.5867,1.9347,1.0641,3.1002,1.8666,1.7853,4.9307,2.3219,7.2597,7.9501,2.4609,5.4098,2.1267,2.4921,4.7898,0.1516,4.2647,3.194,0.968,0.0325,1.9159,1.2208,9.8562,1.6437,7.0954,3.747,1.0534,2.5384,3.0858,0.8944,3.9993,1.3674,4.5854,4.7404,0.0484,3.7828,6.3132,2.0013,3.2664,3.0894,3.1029,0.212,1.9683,0.7152,0.0911,2.0815,0.6375,2.4463,5.443,0.7026,3.0639,0.0061,2.8767,0.3194,0.9443,3.709,4.366,2.5968,2.6856,5.4204,5.8477,1.9477,4.4827,0.5388,0.7914,4.282,0.8439,7.4381,2.3693,0.7153,7.2552,0.474,7.6247,3.0006,4.7814,1.4459,6.5188,3.0441,1.8524,3.3338,0.5971,4.5624,0.7374,1.4501,1.8393,5.9409,7.2425,0.2696,0.3968,3.1752,5.3346,1.4532,2.745,2.4207,0.0031,3.3741,0.6603,0.807,6.9601,3.767,1.6385,3.8086,2.0329,5.2531,6.7449,3.944,5.2087,0.7067,2.936,1.3755,0.7308,2.4201,1.7983,2.2465,3.0999,5.621,3.6825,2.4159,2.5605,3.2013,0.6662,2.4664,5.0921,0.9405,2.0292,0.6783,6.6729,2.2277,1.4002,1.8924,3.5137,2.1335,5.5562,0.4524,4.2574,3.1141,1.5649,1.9082,0.7855,0.9091,3.9286,6.6832,0.7503,2.921,1.8272,1.9819,3.315,5.0902,5.889,1.6741,2.7619,2.0082,2.3799,3.0054,0.9246,2.4102,2.2355,0.152,4.2223,2.7481,6.0952,5.6432,1.861,4.5185,3.4763,2.4647,1.97,0.3035,1.0036,5.3775,8.9271,3.9088,2.6895,0.9464,6.262,3.9553,0.6471,4.7994,1.5582,3.7095,3.5816,2.0175,3.2987,0.6455,2.0968,0.5738,0.9305,0.29,2.6022,1.344,4.4953,0.2649,3.6526,5.154,2.1135,2.9109,8.3131,0.113,2.2426,3.558,2.3191,0.2426,0.0705,3.194,0.9437,0.2126]}

Cloud harvesting is the art of harnessing the most important and vital resource of the future. This technology allows the cloud to deliver massive amounts of information in a fraction of the time it takes to gather, store and distribute information using conventional storage methods. A cloud is a storage area with computing power that sits in the middle, between the user and the data storage provider. The Cloud is composed from many different resources including, servers, applications, physical hardware, and software. Cloud Computing is widely considered a step change in computer technology.\nWhat is Cloud Computing in simple terms is, any information that is stored outside of the user\u2019s device is considered as Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing will allow the user to access data on a large scale with minimal or no setup in the user's device. Cloud Computing is different from Cloud Storage. The cloud storage is a service that provides users the ability to store files on a cloud server with no need to install any software on the device.

The player takes some time, searches for the NPC in the game, and finds him in a safe place under siege by an angry mob. The mob wants the game's NPCs for a reward. The player takes on the role of the trapped NPC to save the town. The game tells a more complex story from this point on. The player learns that the player NPC is a famous game designer, whose job is to help people enter the game.\nThe game is a very good introduction to the way a designer and player can work with game systems. Designers want their games to be the best that they can be, while players want their fun to be as intense as possible - which is an impossible goal. The game is designed in a way such that the same features used by the game will also appear in other games produced by the game designer. When it is played as a game, it gives them a real connection to the game and also allows them to think about game design. It is a clear and simple demonstration that good design allows any game to be used in any game.","token_len":249,"entropy":[11.8262,7.3377,3.2107,3.9303,6.2686,2.5781,1.1018,1.6445,3.3196,5.0351,0.5153,0.4913,1.0298,5.2852,3.3545,3.4014,2.0169,1.8392,1.6958,5.4191,0.5217,2.0315,2.4809,3.2418,1.1749,3.632,3.5694,2.675,6.0239,1.863,1.3635,2.3227,2.2331,4.4687,5.1416,1.8508,3.1208,8.6527,0.7547,1.4177,1.62,2.7457,1.0163,0.4069,0.3761,0.3683,3.0402,1.7763,2.0451,1.043,5.448,1.4531,5.4625,8.9854,2.4701,2.4744,3.7167,0.9117,0.6226,1.515,3.3159,4.9045,2.2877,3.0156,2.5284,5.7312,4.7331,2.7221,3.444,1.7307,1.3475,0.6273,3.1554,3.0962,0.3304,0.6617,0.0173,1.4098,8.1602,0.795,3.9431,3.6462,0.6107,4.4124,1.5438,1.6871,1.184,5.0085,3.9569,5.8234,3.5353,0.2196,5.7381,1.7639,0.2166,0.6572,0.9192,2.1188,1.7251,3.868,1.3909,0.9183,3.0905,10.4336,1.0713,1.4473,7.0202,3.7599,1.1908,1.6111,4.438,3.4571,0.8872,0.0838,2.9176,3.1105,7.2352,0.5598,0.351,1.1202,2.6309,6.3114,1.4225,2.4697,2.5802,3.4583,3.6087,4.9663,0.2478,1.0819,5.4516,3.3426,6.3001,4.3612,3.262,0.6873,1.691,4.5696,4.0699,3.036,0.6305,7.2353,0.1719,5.5422,3.5629,1.7636,0.0971,0.9065,4.348,0.7045,4.0829,0.3229,0.063,1.5127,0.9893,3.4872,1.0497,0.3667,1.0359,10.7784,0.7559,0.4921,2.4798,3.8492,0.3586,0.103,6.3119,3.8556,0.826,4.8552,4.4337,0.6569,1.1003,1.8626,1.1154,1.6818,3.3345,3.3692,1.004,0.6976,7.4559,0.1063,1.4787,6.6063,5.4647,6.0447,1.9474,2.0084,1.9812,3.4544,3.8625,4.8221,0.5848,2.0587,0.4845,7.9766,0.413,1.1109,3.6386,2.5004,0.3564,4.7901,3.6935,2.7675,5.1824,4.088,0.7613,1.5183,0.3195,1.9453,4.1764,6.6234,1.1186,4.584,5.3502,0.734,0.3721,1.0171,2.475,4.7924,2.4546,0.3281,0.0989,4.5953,1.0648,4.1661,0.8921,1.8459,2.8462,1.1894,1.5462,6.7622,2.8937,2.8076,6.6695,2.0416,6.1326,1.245,5.3343,7.0006,1.2536,0.3983,1.0351,4.918,1.9669,2.534,3.8788,1.1756]}

And it is making her miserable too.","token_len":250,"entropy":[3.7235,6.6711,4.8172,4.2473,9.3588,1.4991,1.7413,5.1174,2.5318,0.9643,3.4598,3.2154,12.8395,8.805,9.0349,4.1507,3.6241,8.5593,1.9403,6.1299,4.0481,3.6072,1.41,0.2961,0.6567,3.7965,0.8206,1.8032,5.2012,6.8534,7.7389,3.1186,5.8913,2.6976,5.8417,0.0173,3.916,6.4908,1.4632,6.5703,0.246,0.256,0.4494,0.4359,0.8825,2.9109,5.4222,4.0795,1.7226,0.9559,8.3063,0.2112,6.383,0.8418,0.1274,0.1029,0.2944,0.2891,0.4322,3.4294,6.646,2.5872,0.9438,0.5254,2.4167,3.6452,3.6027,2.752,3.8098,0.1909,3.288,0.8134,4.8824,0.5204,0.4395,0.2635,0.3897,4.0963,4.1736,6.4595,1.9142,1.5626,9.1656,1.5498,5.2134,6.1331,2.0097,2.1641,8.225,2.8392,2.2119,5.1084,1.7672,1.531,0.8181,1.3779,2.4025,5.5857,2.5986,7.7545,0.9582,4.0048,0.3787,0.6187,4.0704,3.9524,1.4832,1.1597,3.1344,1.4121,2.0021,2.0096,3.7614,6.0953,10.8645,4.1435,3.2951,5.0825,4.5437,1.6109,3.7342,3.7758,1.2972,2.0623,0.6432,2.5852,4.089,5.733,0.279,5.062,1.6095,2.9728,0.4641,8.1009,4.3619,6.9592,2.1202,1.2933,5.2563,0.6744,1.6721,4.6468,1.1307,0.2957,2.8642,3.0006,0.3428,2.0013,5.6598,0.5041,2.2693,7.1465,0.083,1.512,5.1409,2.0902,5.0211,0.929,0.6042,4.5658,0.549,2.7365,1.2974,4.4059,2.1835,0.6717,5.6543,2.9475,2.236,4.1974,0.761,0.3739,4.7607,0.057,4.5233,3.3171,5.1788,0.2348,6.4623,2.3883,0.9575,2.1646,5.5855,0.76,3.861,3.6543,6.6142,0.8542,0.0132,2.6848,0.28,4.2141,2.1551,5.1457,0.3792,1.0862,1.0252,5.0541,0.3005,2.5543,6.766,1.9915,0.6492,2.336,2.4406,4.6321,0.15,5.2956,0.427,0.3545,3.7782,0.5425,0.7814,0.7851,1.727,2.292,6.3174,0.4114,0.6567,0.4942,1.876,1.1732,4.8478,3.0199,0.7959,6.8633,2.0906,0.4105,2.7394,0.8939,1.6048,4.779,0.0992,2.3893,1.947,4.6307,3.4853,1.6792,0.7049,3.2195,0.5893,2.8685,3.9107,0.5619,7.8606,0.8465,7.2001,6.612,0.3025]}

You can choose to end the life of one of the rebels or to let them die, knowing they are innocent.\nWhat do you do?\nI choose to save the life of them rebels and to kill the traitor, without the knowledge of all, even the rebel leader.\nI guess we can just consider the following cases.\n\nThe traitor is either innocent or the king is.\nThe king is either not the traitor or is a traitor who tried to stop the traitor from killing a rebel.\nThe king is innocent and a traitor is killed by the traitor. \n\nIn each of these cases you don't know who is the traitor. But you know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.\nBut if you have no idea who is the traitor then you must let the rebel leader die because it means that someone thinks that you are a traitor.","token_len":251,"entropy":[8.7477,2.745,2.2153,4.5779,7.3011,0.0215,3.1605,5.3483,4.0525,1.8334,4.2863,5.1743,0.0488,6.1769,6.24,1.4067,0.9285,1.8198,1.0658,7.5607,5.5077,2.3353,3.7526,8.9915,0.0381,1.2302,2.5582,4.0503,2.0921,1.9354,2.7443,6.3812,0.1346,3.4556,3.0263,9.4948,0.9885,3.1698,0.3464,4.5546,4.646,1.3723,0.8493,1.2207,2.0495,9.5804,4.5512,5.6045,3.4211,2.1715,7.4062,2.7857,2.3233,3.3154,3.7408,1.2682,5.5372,1.1941,4.8083,0.7667,4.817,2.7099,4.1859,0.3776,4.7889,2.7481,2.2996,3.8833,1.0423,1.046,1.1172,1.9777,3.0495,1.3218,0.4228,5.5721,0.9654,5.0105,0.1222,2.6341,0.8071,1.2886,1.1607,1.2702,2.521,3.8966,1.2929,1.6199,2.6918,5.9307,2.2286,1.7651,5.2604,0.821,1.5259,4.3959,2.5114,0.3965,0.595,1.868,1.024,3.8669,3.6796,0.5851,4.2591,1.2944,1.9714,0.017,6.4141,10.9303,2.4122,3.0194,2.0523,1.9244,6.0472,3.9497,6.2867,3.1533,2.2563,0.5537,5.2286,6.0234,4.4517,1.9674,4.4564,2.6216,0.646,1.1723,2.381,6.7825,3.6616,1.9768,3.8653,6.4599,1.8927,4.5738,6.8209,1.5751,0.5361,6.9924,2.7056,4.7058,1.9499,6.5184,4.7429,0.3402,3.4102,5.0417,1.5967,6.1327,0.7601,9.4468,1.5101,0.8112,3.3106,4.3775,3.2693,1.4722,0.6511,2.1712,2.4657,1.568,3.966,5.6968,0.0976,3.7657,1.4793,4.813,2.0008,1.2619,4.2779,3.4482,0.6074,0.2242,4.1055,1.433,0.4396,3.8492,1.9497,4.2333,0.4094,2.7657,4.0115,1.6629,1.1423,1.5747,0.4422,7.8092,4.368,2.6701,3.8489,4.2656,1.0523,0.3362,0.1669,2.6151,4.684,0.0018,1.8619,1.7076,2.0013,0.9187,0.2338,1.5234,4.1676,1.3209,1.5324,0.9017,0.8595,0.5015,4.0387,0.1018,1.3877,0.8769,0.2816,0.2658,0.3542,0.0074,0.4042,0.728,10.9704,2.9517,0.5323,3.2105,3.1709,1.3083,0.4757,0.7057,0.1432,0.8391,2.4776,0.6279,4.2509,6.0917,1.4342,3.2694,2.7623,1.1404,3.7416,2.7832,3.5653,2.6008,5.0652,7.5151,1.7937,0.6005,0.4891,2.4031,0.4366,0.7732]}

We have a long history of conflict with them. I doubt that our species even has the ability to coexist with theirs.\nIt's the kind of question that the creators of the original series of Star Trek (the series) had to consider some time back.

If not, then life in the galaxy would look like a cold, alien world inhabited by aliens that look like us.\nTo me, that doesn't make any sense.

Simple is what first caught my eye as this was a short novel \u2013 only a handful of hundred pages is needed to tell an interesting, yet complex tale that will keep you turning the pages.\nI believe this is the book to pick up if you like epic sci-fi novels that are more about the characters, characters that are both very well fleshed out and who we care deeply about.\nAt the same time, it is a great novel for those who are fans of Alien and do not wish to venture into the Alien sequels to find themselves lost ( I know it has happened, and sadly it has happened to me several times )\nIn case you missed it, Michael A.

That is why Time is afraid of the Gods and their influence.\nTime and the Gods will always go against each others'interests because there is something the common for all humans, desire.","token_len":254,"entropy":[11.3032,2.1852,9.4361,6.0497,5.4772,4.5258,8.5457,0.7691,4.2312,2.2832,0.9331,6.7715,2.2321,2.3391,3.5273,3.8342,2.0254,1.9185,1.578,2.4646,4.805,0.8522,7.0367,0.5799,2.1116,0.0253,2.7395,5.7385,3.4149,1.287,2.2314,3.9554,2.1329,5.0242,3.5891,6.0999,0.0998,5.2707,13.4556,10.0813,9.5917,1.4375,2.2111,3.093,9.4895,3.1419,2.4012,0.7204,6.212,1.5566,1.1943,2.8133,0.0002,3.5735,5.539,0.0019,3.4937,2.5263,4.2324,1.5816,2.056,0.0003,4.1259,1.9207,3.3882,0.0012,3.2665,1.6944,4.5312,0.8621,1.1184,3.6679,3.3688,1.4699,3.6604,0.1514,6.132,0.3432,0.7885,0.0003,4.1026,6.0019,4.4952,7.7627,0.5106,2.7884,4.994,2.8391,0.5815,0.5807,0.0003,4.19,2.0212,5.3583,0.7381,2.9022,1.7051,3.6024,3.3186,4.7207,5.1939,0.4751,2.9197,3.2627,2.621,1.4936,4.4018,3.099,5.3824,1.9274,5.338,3.2031,6.1973,7.6128,0.1176,0.2918,0.0003,3.1804,2.8567,3.9337,0.7516,0.1086,3.5712,4.2866,4.4247,0.7557,4.2279,1.5846,6.0168,0.287,3.8507,2.6035,3.1181,3.5419,4.7694,2.7697,5.9897,4.8794,0.7459,6.7524,4.9139,0.5937,2.4928,2.0228,0.644,0.377,0.0003,2.4071,3.6852,3.2769,1.3229,2.8781,2.5548,3.158,1.9968,1.4504,3.3572,2.1599,4.1927,4.6314,5.0888,0.6521,0.8264,5.0215,6.9175,1.7853,2.3047,0.1229,0.4348,6.34,0.7567,0.0044,1.1864,4.1706,3.7789,0.8873,4.1025,1.1572,4.6788,4.4496,0.5128,1.9246,0.2781,0.7019,0.079,0.3282,0.3616,0.0003,3.4401,4.194,6.427,5.6141,0.0005,2.8421,0.1417,3.0947,3.2365,0.5051,1.6667,0.7651,2.1631,2.2713,5.9765,1.8213,1.3957,4.5124,2.6959,4.7562,1.8897,6.9811,2.5778,2.8379,3.3405,0.5533,5.1906,1.1776,0.645,2.4417,1.3605,7.6035,0.3971,2.5611,1.4181,1.9045,4.3495,4.3091,0.6416,0.3908,23.5969,4.2801,2.301,0.7106,4.0035,2.3392,5.5926,2.6932,1.8242,5.7771,1.8528,15.5244,0.3244,5.0159,3.8023,0.5659,3.9483,5.6354,8.8727,8.0247,1.8102,2.9932,3.4053,9.9502,3.3228]}

There are plenty of things that could destroy civilization, but the technology itself could never do that.","token_len":255,"entropy":[8.5493,2.9391,1.5081,6.3904,6.5245,7.5601,3.9156,10.1973,2.1436,2.7347,5.6749,1.6088,4.9044,4.3422,8.2429,2.1546,7.9444,0.9604,1.1307,5.2547,0.6946,6.8444,3.6991,8.3858,7.0062,0.3469,1.0639,8.2731,0.2934,0.4061,8.5212,9.5201,0.0966,3.0835,1.7724,7.7982,4.149,11.2634,1.7675,1.8352,10.3997,1.7848,3.1491,0.0199,1.3901,4.449,4.1491,4.2254,6.3225,3.4375,1.36,7.6802,0.8928,2.7154,2.0317,4.9115,0.5001,1.5755,7.1539,3.5873,2.8049,0.5401,4.2918,2.3094,2.4615,4.0058,1.7089,0.9791,7.4786,4.172,5.4225,2.1297,0.2362,3.0192,7.2225,1.6465,5.0038,0.982,1.7755,0.187,0.4379,1.9351,3.8399,1.4169,4.6794,5.0663,8.4522,2.3506,0.4528,0.6929,4.9018,5.2017,2.8537,4.8238,2.3588,1.1133,2.4329,2.762,0.1567,3.6652,4.0094,1.8048,5.8232,2.3401,5.3572,0.6423,3.5504,2.3182,6.0716,0.0066,5.098,5.2958,4.9476,3.8276,5.2071,6.5545,3.8482,7.0218,4.0745,6.5691,2.1681,0.7105,3.3431,2.6883,4.7126,2.5799,2.8935,3.7295,1.0575,5.1422,4.3441,2.238,4.2129,0.5344,2.7348,1.4091,4.8897,3.8503,1.7801,1.4932,7.1528,1.0905,1.2187,5.3656,1.4185,2.5689,0.5359,1.325,3.8262,2.9119,5.4268,2.7864,1.3245,2.1053,3.308,1.0186,0.9132,6.6563,3.963,1.5362,6.0747,0.1935,5.1315,0.6973,2.1265,3.6451,1.9443,2.0709,3.7606,3.5901,4.5302,4.178,4.3781,4.2798,2.0499,1.1306,2.0592,2.042,0.8792,2.3008,2.9457,4.5851,4.9038,3.694,5.4677,0.0348,3.6843,4.8413,1.2285,5.1342,1.4196,4.3385,2.1195,6.0226,3.2557,7.0961,2.882,0.6984,3.5747,0.0153,4.0901,3.9325,2.3373,3.2477,2.0337,1.7328,3.2339,0.3487,6.5516,1.3789,5.4412,1.0387,3.573,3.1445,2.9548,1.1409,3.904,1.2812,4.1743,3.4843,1.282,2.4024,6.2899,0.5519,2.1987,5.2685,0.3345,3.334,5.0241,2.1087,4.5295,0.5262,3.5855,0.6947,0.8699,4.5759,0.6933,4.7582,0.0908,3.6108,0.5775,1.4858,5.5358,4.127,1.5266,1.172,2.6668,3.5301,4.1579,2.6513,4.0934,2.1899,1.0868,0.3514]}

Earth, as a whole, has done quite well in the past. Despite all the destruction and killing it has done, it has managed to thrive by keeping the spirit, purpose and vision alive. You have done exceptionally well, and you have also done just as well, or even better, since the beginning of the twentyfirst century. When you get this big test, I would hope that you see things in a different way. You can and must move beyond the past and into an intergalactic future. And in that future you will need a vision, a belief system, a purpose, and a commitment to a higher order, a commitment more powerful and richer than the Earth-centeredness that created the violence and death.\nI know I am rambling. I hope I am not. I hope you have a connection, even a tenuous one, with Earth and the world that humanity built. At any rate, I have hope that you have something you would not want to be without.\nI would also be glad to answer any questions you may have.

I assume they must have had some sort of genetic or molecular analysis done on your breeding stock...would be a good thing to remember.\nThe idea of making cats more intelligent is a joke in so many ways. Not a lot of research has been done, yet they already have a brain like a kid, as well as the same type of behavior of the kid. The reason there have been no problems is because the cat's behavior is in control of its mind and mindless. If they were genetically programmed and made to be a brain like a kid, they would be incapable of any rational thought or logic. If they had the same kind of behavioral control, then it is impossible to control them and make them a cat of a certain breed. To tell a simple fact, a kid never goes to school and will do what he wants, like running around and having fun as kids do. In the same way, a cat will not always choose to do what you want it to.

Unfortunately, it will probably take quite a while for that to happen. Right now the only way to avoid cheating is trust, that can be hard to achieve if there are other players present\nSome good ideas have been suggested already, like the teleporters that automatically disappear after you have used them. But this can be circumvented by stealing the teleporters before you use them and running away. So, cheating can easily be prevented as long as a teleport is stolen, the player who stole it can be sent automatically to the next port using the teleporter's name or a random string of characters.

He just wants people to recognise what he is going through - maybe he needs help just to make it OK for him to be human - you know what I mean?

He realizes that his family that he has met in previous lives has seen him but he doesn't remember what it was like for him.\nHe finds the only information that he has left behind is the number of a girl in a past world (Mina) and she keeps giving him instructions while he has to fight in different realities to get her number.","token_len":261,"entropy":[7.3022,7.7007,0.1504,3.6287,10.5425,2.2607,7.0166,1.1391,1.258,2.8924,2.1189,6.8072,1.1389,5.9553,0.387,7.3753,1.6203,9.2826,8.5426,7.8222,6.9405,4.2837,11.8072,0.4238,3.5399,1.8299,6.9686,0.5894,0.7068,0.4487,11.4916,9.6187,1.94,7.178,1.1168,2.3388,4.7589,2.5374,1.6316,5.363,0.6867,4.7801,2.8336,3.7114,5.072,0.3532,3.0011,6.1589,2.4743,3.7178,4.1273,0.7119,3.5541,5.7849,1.7471,2.3791,1.1227,3.8218,5.6089,0.6383,0.9979,5.6034,5.5316,2.1641,5.174,0.7647,3.2497,1.4765,4.9797,4.8542,5.0699,0.9057,2.0357,6.6451,0.6536,2.8462,3.3802,6.2061,3.2422,2.6947,0.9542,5.2098,0.8986,4.7138,2.0543,2.5898,0.0129,4.3444,3.1478,6.8733,2.2328,5.3203,1.0663,0.0954,0.7243,2.9712,5.5863,3.9937,1.8345,4.2187,0.8154,6.4162,0.6346,5.8191,0.207,5.3821,2.9896,0.1566,3.5024,4.5104,1.3276,0.6408,3.0267,2.3469,0.7135,4.2235,5.3184,2.3544,2.2029,0.3856,4.4154,1.1673,4.3714,5.1013,4.7941,1.5669,4.169,0.7323,5.5899,4.1856,3.0427,0.1204,1.9939,1.3247,2.9636,2.6031,3.8689,2.2776,3.84,1.9578,2.4346,0.1676,3.2629,3.0968,0.8549,0.8943,3.8139,0.5297,0.1123,0.8054,4.9216,4.959,4.2804,1.0356,5.5348,8.9009,0.8872,4.2179,2.8448,3.3044,2.4364,0.9747,2.1641,4.5616,0.9239,2.5267,1.9491,1.1759,3.5147,6.1364,0.4584,1.9879,5.5784,1.3979,5.3304,0.6577,1.9392,1.6125,1.2084,2.9178,4.1456,3.7705,4.1224,1.0328,4.3964,0.3164,2.2487,3.7447,2.38,1.3446,4.8145,0.2853,2.2076,4.2749,5.8669,1.331,2.3609,2.1635,1.9081,5.2272,0.9511,2.3361,5.434,1.3185,4.6404,1.4413,2.5601,0.0019,4.1408,2.3653,2.8293,0.3728,0.7678,2.3538,0.5245,1.0905,3.4793,2.0921,3.1932,2.0208,5.4312,4.9617,1.4915,0.7114,1.4306,2.4101,0.7396,2.6592,1.8472,6.1494,0.2785,6.3741,4.1535,2.9974,2.6956,4.5569,3.3138,5.7221,5.5023,4.6429,1.28,1.4717,3.2082,6.3312,3.9494,0.2168,5.201,5.6127,0.7048,3.8492,2.0299,4.1663,4.1787,4.9112,6.0246,1.5497,1.4876,2.2226,6.1564,0.6538]}

Not only did I have to redesign my friend, but also, my friends had to be redesigned too.\nI felt this week was very important for our friendship, and I knew that the time had come to redesign some of it!\nI think that redesigning my friend is one of the main reasons why I liked this article and how it came to my attention.\nIf you had to have your friend redesigned to a certain image of what you wanted the best for them to be, what would you redesign them to?","token_len":261,"entropy":[4.5152,7.0926,0.5508,1.2263,6.517,1.2355,1.7846,0.9672,4.8794,2.3183,0.9145,1.2426,4.4873,5.1937,1.782,5.9935,7.7744,0.4275,0.4426,0.9606,1.269,1.6175,6.5181,0.2434,0.0711,8.5397,9.7433,0.655,8.7711,5.8614,0.928,2.8109,4.0782,2.9492,0.9104,1.4855,4.1584,2.5907,4.1512,0.7442,2.6624,2.1098,1.8503,4.288,0.0092,8.6671,1.7378,1.5965,2.4183,14.1335,0.5511,0.0034,0.4166,5.8978,3.0771,0.2327,5.1224,2.8002,1.4398,4.427,4.0873,5.7625,0.7772,0.4395,2.9836,5.3835,5.2734,4.7004,1.9206,1.9625,6.7593,7.653,0.571,2.3325,8.5231,0.5392,0.3805,5.524,1.6815,1.3988,0.7748,2.0937,4.7314,4.202,3.4101,1.8656,4.9902,0.3751,2.4939,1.0305,3.3422,3.6373,0.6106,0.9028,0.0004,0.5422,1.9533,2.7713,3.047,3.4731,5.1822,1.9183,3.0894,1.6663,4.4956,1.2104,1.1514,0.8689,0.1285,2.0832,2.6914,2.3789,1.9143,2.9989,4.1644,0.2763,5.598,0.5326,1.1772,1.3353,3.1745,2.718,3.0758,1.9314,2.8566,4.6721,1.4288,6.9141,1.7171,0.4474,5.0323,0.2541,0.1651,10.7522,0.2019,5.9604,0.9028,2.6522,1.0513,4.1876,1.4896,5.1067,0.4528,0.2271,0.7013,0.4702,5.6466,0.0558,5.0508,4.9822,7.3557,4.2851,3.2961,2.6436,0.6481,5.7733,0.1707,1.1575,0.74,3.1949,0.8929,6.1276,1.0901,5.8855,2.2486,0.8924,2.8463,3.6928,3.4486,3.1693,3.645,0.3251,4.1709,6.4116,1.3522,0.4741,1.0276,1.6869,5.8406,4.1317,3.9717,1.5954,4.2152,1.105,1.7035,5.3286,4.935,1.4416,1.0871,1.4123,4.8167,1.0229,3.1914,3.6067,2.0057,0.0358,0.64,5.9778,4.7276,0.3671,5.522,4.7897,1.2498,1.7136,3.4052,2.3641,5.577,0.7489,3.4275,0.3662,1.6362,2.3416,0.2798,0.2136,4.2438,1.0801,1.1154,0.8785,5.8949,1.2225,5.2829,3.9471,2.9448,1.4328,3.8484,1.0966,3.4494,0.4884,0.2354,1.5828,3.9388,0.1802,4.736,1.537,6.3965,1.869,3.76,5.3024,3.4978,3.5908,1.4034,5.6586,3.7105,3.3075,1.6497,2.8149,5.3646,4.1906,1.6378,1.857,2.5655,1.2368,0.4394,3.1512,0.3121,1.2293,3.8505,1.2938,1.0399,0.4039]}

Each boss must be fought using a different key. As you progress through the'maze ', your health bar starts at 30 and drops down when you are killed.

{"prompt":"Nonfiction - Tell Us About Your First kiss .","text":"Nonfiction - Tell Us About Your First kiss. I met my husband at a beach on the north coast of England with a big group of friends. They all had friends who were friends of their friends. We were sat in a caravan by the sea and were enjoying being together. I was about 19 or so, my boyfriend was 18.\nThe last thing I remember is lying on my back on the beach and one man reaching down to kiss me. I don't even know what happened next. I woke up in a flat in the centre of London and my parents had found a way to get me out.\nHow many more years do I have to go? The woman with a very large belly and legs crossed and knees bent over, was walking backwards up to the front of the stage, wearing a red coat that gave the impression of floating up her back almost like flowing silk.\nShe was wearing black jeans with a ruffly sweater with a red collar, which floated down over she legs which she had crossed. She had her hands in her pockets, looked up at the audience, and then bent down with a grin to take the microphone. This site does not host the books.

What a few good work you do on people's life.\nYou can change other people's moods. Some people might think that you are evil. It doesn't matter. You know yourself and you're good to people. Just let them see for themselves.\nThere were a lot of friends before, it was much better. I had a big family with some younger ones and some old ones. You can easily get along with everyone. Sooner or later the younger ones will leave. The old ones might die soon. Still no matter who leaves, it doesn't bring great changes to the world.\nThat is OK, they will stay with you forever. Some will stay with you and some will leave. That happens every day. You need to accept it and not think too much about it. What is important to you is the people who stay with you, you may lose some friends from the past who have been there forever and there is no other reason. The biggest problem is that no one can live forever. One day you will also die. It happens every day.

A teen parent is losing their child, while a man is getting married. Four different lives, one day - make them connect. That was it - and it was so powerful.\nI watched a clip of that scene and it is beautiful. Love it when people don't try and make their feelings seem more deep by having dramatic scenes and a lot of emotion. Just nice.\ni haven't been able to read on much but just a quick word that i was really going to watch the movie and i didn't - it's too cringy - as if you weren't getting excited for each other it would give too much away and you won't enjoy it to no end. don't do things to let your partners down. that's just not right and i thought it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen.\nI have not seen the movie yet but just loved the song. Its so cute and funny.

The heroine will be a strong female character. A story that explores the dark side of humanity- the death of someone you love. The best story should be based on facts. It should not be a typical story with a very sad ending. You do not need to make an outline, but you need to write a rough draft while making a few notes. Your story should be as funny as can be because you can use humor to illustrate the main point of your story. Your topic should be something controversial or taboo in order to stand out and create a contrast. Don't try to copy any of the famous stories in your category. Choose just one story to base your story on. The title of the story will be very important because it will define the story's purpose. Choose the words carefully so that your title will be attractive. When you finish the outline, read the completed draft carefully to make necessary changes. The main thing in the story is the heroine. She might be an animal, a character from fairy tales or Disney movies. You can add a twist by adding new characters to the story. All in all, your story can be different and unique.","token_len":265,"entropy":[6.0771,3.5213,9.1424,2.5216,0.303,8.3169,0.6644,2.5161,1.1103,8.8257,7.4758,8.9311,3.263,4.2742,9.3329,4.0082,2.29,5.256,0.5863,2.3543,6.0707,4.6073,3.6044,3.7587,1.4326,1.2665,7.8284,0.1223,3.9899,4.7938,0.3287,0.3973,2.8447,8.9313,3.7163,1.9988,2.9541,5.3078,3.5954,1.2598,2.8245,4.3655,5.0081,2.1343,4.6509,1.1365,5.7303,0.5664,0.0807,3.3995,4.1547,2.1367,4.8133,0.4968,3.5865,3.1817,0.6666,1.8518,2.6737,5.1866,3.7401,5.9464,0.6732,4.6684,0.3138,5.4026,1.9114,3.4708,1.0954,1.967,0.4901,2.1894,7.0021,1.7055,3.3762,1.6468,5.4767,4.433,0.2109,0.4411,3.7921,4.7289,0.1289,1.4701,0.2387,4.195,3.0974,6.0154,3.0185,1.575,1.6393,2.2084,0.1562,3.7547,1.7321,6.2517,3.9213,7.8622,3.4025,2.2573,3.6166,3.1132,0.6691,4.9734,2.4199,0.455,0.8987,3.4028,5.2192,0.2451,5.7482,0.0429,5.3456,1.6455,2.5231,3.8743,2.5354,1.5255,4.9671,1.6649,3.685,3.0506,1.2897,1.2242,0.2864,0.3854,3.9308,7.7028,0.3843,0.3879,3.2973,8.3465,1.4075,4.0597,3.9252,3.1585,0.0561,5.3144,0.1271,2.9198,5.1234,1.0401,4.5308,1.5488,4.0563,0.0024,3.3653,0.1284,6.3567,4.1933,1.5941,0.5569,5.2742,2.604,2.6849,1.3442,7.5146,0.6992,5.9568,5.3314,1.3405,1.9933,3.3158,7.4246,0.1749,0.4614,0.7298,0.4907,2.8645,6.5802,1.3227,1.8057,0.3072,3.3599,1.0154,5.1406,0.9017,3.3382,0.8368,0.8344,4.9286,0.9676,2.2645,3.1596,4.9907,0.6358,5.5074,2.1201,5.3872,6.2358,3.0957,0.5381,2.4917,5.3651,1.4554,1.251,6.7768,1.7342,4.2598,1.2002,3.4674,1.6855,6.5981,0.5535,4.3526,1.1673,7.2794,2.9883,4.2253,2.4546,1.8415,11.4133,1.1959,0.5585,2.7944,3.0728,3.0493,4.6381,1.9934,2.1055,0.9742,1.8248,4.0754,1.1479,2.3385,5.5169,1.0145,3.5348,5.4205,1.042,1.1338,4.4428,2.8014,5.474,0.2454,1.5434,10.0865,1.7248,0.9027,2.8642,1.8385,3.5016,2.1891,6.5717,2.9723,1.0158,4.4715,1.4537,2.1545,0.7061,0.8754,0.5766,5.4545,4.7082,0.015,0.2902,2.2741,0.4623,5.0236,0.5019,5.7005,2.468,2.7341,0.678]}

They did receive one transmission from Earth every ten years. They are not that worried about Earth contact or not. They didn't really get that far off in this mission, and they didn't want to be too much of a distraction from their search for the sun's outer planets.\nThe next day, Apollo 6 was launched and left our solar system for further exploration on a trip that would take them to Saturn, Jupiter's giant gas planets and beyond. And what we have to know is : Where are all the stars we see in the sky really coming from? And of course if you look at your hands or your legs, they just have come from the same place that you are, right?\nIf you don't believe that the solar system will become like the stars, you haven't actually spent any time looking at the stars.\nIf you go out into the dark of the night, without any light or any other light source to help guide you, then what happens? What is going to happen to your eye? Well, your eye just goes blind.

A thousand years after the war, a scout ship discovers the previously unknown planet of Earth, militarized to the brim. There are so many people that the scout ship is unable to fit in their entire load (which would have been impossible on Earth), so they decide to put off the people to another planet for now. While being in space, their captain is killed as a result of a virus that is not understood yet. The first person it hits dies and soon afterwards the entire crew dies - except him. They also killed a few other people in order to be able to transport all of the people for a few years, and the virus was not stopped yet. The captain died with his eyes open trying to send commands to keep the people alive, and in his death it freed the virus from the command system, which soon infected everybody else. The next day after the captain\u2019s death, all people died unless the captain\u2019s corpse was in sight or the survivors looked for him in order to communicate with him, and to protect him. No one had any idea what really happened. After all, they only realized three years later that they somehow managed to stay alive.","token_len":267,"entropy":[7.4121,4.0628,7.5942,8.0745,0.0112,4.4085,3.0507,5.6889,8.1038,0.5842,5.794,8.8828,7.8178,2.5007,3.1355,4.5404,7.4783,8.8541,1.6938,4.8593,2.1488,5.413,1.7975,1.6253,13.6089,0.442,0.0727,12.5383,1.44,4.4063,5.6722,0.4742,1.7321,0.8728,3.3305,0.9545,2.7039,9.1446,2.5001,6.3642,2.0218,9.0184,1.3805,2.7369,2.5211,4.1992,1.3135,12.3217,0.161,2.3294,1.7184,6.007,2.7764,4.8495,2.2191,5.2309,0.0912,3.4506,2.9629,2.5429,4.1061,0.4479,1.9763,3.5118,0.0093,4.3515,2.0737,4.2687,4.2863,6.4115,6.2461,3.6852,3.742,2.5525,1.1038,2.5131,4.31,1.1618,1.9524,2.1732,1.519,3.2032,0.065,4.7601,4.7636,2.1577,7.0271,3.9053,6.5444,0.7525,2.9018,3.1137,0.4161,4.9322,5.001,4.2249,1.9073,0.6003,4.0229,4.2557,2.479,3.5384,4.8072,2.1128,0.2547,0.7757,1.811,5.4176,1.9139,2.9366,4.2028,6.7348,3.5685,0.5071,2.0292,4.9367,2.7006,5.8725,5.9087,8.3136,2.9687,6.0329,2.8064,1.7889,3.5481,0.994,3.9434,6.8799,4.3051,7.857,0.5904,3.8224,4.375,6.6634,1.6421,2.5255,1.6698,0.8285,2.5896,3.4723,0.0279,4.4039,1.2074,0.0063,6.6453,4.5438,1.2011,1.034,1.6212,5.0858,1.8779,2.9553,2.9479,2.1476,2.1648,2.9891,5.4516,2.8426,3.4475,4.9776,3.5607,0.3572,1.9366,4.7632,4.722,4.9082,1.9727,6.1154,2.5474,6.9959,0.0343,7.0086,8.152,0.6311,7.4076,0.9986,1.6637,1.322,1.5813,1.28,4.2908,3.0644,3.3504,4.5546,10.5342,1.266,5.4378,0.8514,1.3592,6.1381,2.2254,2.1736,2.6078,6.6768,4.9677,5.2357,2.0128,0.7849,1.6512,3.3293,1.9156,4.9789,1.178,3.4242,16.4772,7.872,2.5407,0.1698,0.4015,4.1564,5.5249,4.9452,9.0721,2.1926,2.4503,6.3404,0.0583,0.0886,5.6079,0.4504,4.7723,7.0386,3.828,2.1531,5.1359,7.21,1.8871,1.949,3.5226,3.3455,0.0438,5.5546,0.8547,0.6266,2.5144,1.5547,4.4847,4.3053,1.1171,0.976,5.4719,0.4753,3.8156,1.9713,1.1711,1.3159,6.2777,0.0956,2.1732,3.6624,2.6168,0.2796,2.8361,4.2488,4.9776,6.5554,1.7933,0.6639,0.6716,1.9408,7.4371,2.204,0.017,5.8161,0.206,1.8506]}

'' You open your eyes to see that you're fine. Only, that's not Jesus driving... you yourself. You were at a point in time with your own self. All those times in your life in which you felt God the way you feel in your life at the moment, those are just moments with a self that is in charge of these sensations.\nTo think you have to reach some point in your life in order to know God is absurd. It makes no sense. God has never left you. He is always with you, in everything. Only you have to let Him in, to feel His presence. This feeling of God doesn't arrive when you read a Bible, it arrives with love towards other people.\nThis is how you will find God : living with passion and courage to live honestly. Don't fall into the same trap everybody does : a life that is devoid of meaning and purpose. If you don't feel God for the first time in your life, think that was because you weren't alive. That's it : you didn't live until you took the time to see people and make friends. The only way to feel Him is to do the things He told you to do.","token_len":268,"entropy":[8.1881,5.7785,0.9333,3.1404,8.1373,4.1734,1.1232,1.0618,4.794,8.631,1.6194,2.4174,2.2244,0.0835,0.001,0.8318,3.5393,10.4372,14.9347,10.2971,2.5163,4.0396,1.6701,3.4463,4.0133,6.6115,0.4227,1.1822,2.8415,1.6451,2.5632,2.3696,1.4954,7.6077,0.9081,6.9986,3.4683,3.7254,1.5066,0.6784,4.1656,7.6089,5.4532,3.652,9.0887,0.9542,1.8452,4.8731,5.3475,1.924,4.0634,1.4311,1.1532,6.487,2.3211,3.1306,4.2177,2.9376,4.8896,3.8643,3.7043,3.67,1.0931,0.1598,4.576,0.9584,0.3482,2.9351,5.5433,7.182,1.2239,0.8999,2.2174,3.2632,1.3065,2.672,5.0928,1.2804,1.0107,1.9871,5.6133,1.9349,3.794,2.0155,4.9109,2.8306,4.132,1.4673,1.7209,3.2158,4.6746,1.0754,6.1687,6.5573,0.8549,2.8325,7.1109,4.2625,2.4165,3.1531,2.4998,6.7319,5.217,2.3513,1.1875,1.0653,0.1854,2.6131,0.2401,0.0944,3.6687,1.6775,0.8505,4.535,0.323,2.0693,3.8207,1.5533,0.019,0.9161,3.359,2.6874,3.5556,5.5316,0.7914,0.9711,1.1632,2.4989,2.1368,2.8821,0.0387,1.8403,3.6973,5.8951,1.481,6.2163,2.6742,2.1409,0.6567,5.5142,1.5739,4.4637,2.3914,2.7002,3.6626,1.8308,0.2883,1.0038,3.8695,5.2108,1.3843,2.6671,5.6671,0.0007,7.0015,2.5706,0.199,6.8434,2.755,3.294,2.0261,2.808,1.6003,4.1742,6.9791,7.5611,6.3642,0.2604,0.5664,2.2411,3.5523,1.0298,3.1733,1.7896,4.5908,2.5833,1.7332,8.7515,9.0779,2.1786,7.3016,1.8079,6.3395,3.5844,3.4285,6.9972,1.6788,4.9985,0.0024,4.8015,0.7328,1.1919,4.1998,0.4812,9.2867,2.8547,2.9995,4.8154,4.0978,2.2757,1.2175,5.0323,0.0075,4.1386,1.8181,1.7865,0.5912,3.9048,0.35,2.5659,0.0005,2.9546,1.0656,4.3709,2.7714,1.5673,0.1255,2.1592,0.332,0.0534,0.2836,5.1685,4.8634,7.2812,2.6916,0.6022,4.017,0.0007,5.6261,1.2416,3.4186,1.2123,4.1323,4.0383,1.6971,3.005,0.0004,3.4767,4.2713,0.6356,5.8693,1.4679,3.1649,0.1366,3.409,6.6262,2.1532,4.4962,3.4733,0.4937,3.805,2.4266,1.8061,0.6981,3.0593,4.7435,0.7,0.3286,4.1045,2.7029,0.9329,2.3332,4.5582,0.033,0.3043,0.0961,0.6932]}

This has required me to use a website hosting platform that will be more powerful to host my sites on, and it has been really nice to discover the many options that are available, especially with a little bit of research and a willingness to make some investments in my website.\nSince joining a website hosting platform I have learned many things about my website, including how to make it more efficient for my customers. While I have yet to take advantage of all the capabilities available, I have already noticed some changes that seem to have made my websites more user friendly and faster, I will cover some of the changes shortly.","token_len":268,"entropy":[5.3684,3.0358,5.7401,4.3457,1.8576,3.0159,0.6601,7.8238,10.9979,0.0705,0.3244,1.2959,3.5198,2.642,1.7872,1.13,5.2593,2.642,2.5446,2.9094,1.4213,3.1236,3.8492,0.7016,1.1934,3.8002,2.659,0.4846,0.8004,5.6226,1.5189,4.5503,0.879,1.3588,6.4507,2.1509,6.8758,1.9209,8.9645,3.1386,2.7655,6.2388,3.6537,9.1232,0.282,2.6759,2.4366,2.8921,2.2288,5.4483,1.0662,1.8107,4.2997,0.3486,4.5708,5.3623,2.6702,0.0138,7.0638,1.6283,1.8834,2.4685,5.8169,5.959,3.4164,0.6366,0.8864,2.9712,2.9122,3.3036,0.2573,3.3788,2.4907,0.0111,0.0293,0.2736,3.1713,2.0705,6.2597,0.4019,4.4856,1.8424,1.6916,1.0829,2.5097,15.4768,8.9648,4.9775,1.8852,8.6161,1.8346,3.5796,3.1843,0.3034,0.6059,1.4705,0.6093,3.017,1.5513,5.6938,4.6806,0.9428,1.5703,2.3967,0.9978,3.5,5.7578,2.6282,6.843,5.0773,5.5801,3.4879,5.5195,1.2415,3.2758,6.3366,3.4898,1.4557,7.0341,3.9421,1.9834,0.0296,0.6069,2.4226,5.4261,4.4232,0.2507,3.1829,2.5165,0.9286,5.4004,3.6616,4.8037,1.7852,7.2068,1.4724,0.4837,0.8313,6.8825,4.5595,2.6225,2.0983,2.7137,6.4191,1.2684,3.627,1.5489,6.772,1.1243,0.0829,4.1844,1.6594,5.178,4.1498,2.6577,1.679,4.7311,2.8216,3.2651,5.4974,3.9801,5.3878,1.3561,3.2413,3.4762,1.5494,0.7763,3.802,0.8495,2.1697,4.1154,3.2504,0.4166,6.1554,2.5686,4.7053,4.5593,1.5299,2.5055,0.3717,3.0785,3.5043,2.7875,2.5069,4.9884,1.111,0.0799,3.5826,1.696,2.6795,5.1932,0.0232,3.9129,3.3252,4.6146,1.5596,2.6432,3.0348,0.4755,1.0891,4.4117,4.9713,4.861,2.1919,0.2738,0.659,3.4938,0.5502,4.1235,3.4963,0.4674,1.3184,2.8165,2.4767,0.9695,2.1235,1.7722,0.5491,3.4269,2.0682,1.9878,3.0846,2.3114,1.9948,2.3726,1.6667,4.9657,1.0143,1.6443,4.6812,0.0011,5.0179,2.9196,0.0063,2.1415,0.9783,6.4516,2.4694,1.5766,0.4575,1.4571,4.9735,4.4095,2.1847,2.9763,1.4479,5.5336,0.1901,1.9806,2.319,1.0872,4.6433,1.4265,3.9106,0.3104,1.4508,4.5306,1.9163,5.4802,3.4261,6.1114,2.0604,0.2373,1.2082,2.0903,5.6744,0.2855]}

In addition for now I don't know how I can get settings:\n\nA:\n\nYou don't use the setting in your example but rather a dictionary to store your settings, so you should use setting instead of setting:\nsetting {\n  id = \"setting:1\"\n  name = \"Pixel Size\"\n  size = 32;\n};\n\nsetting {\n  id = \"setting:image\"\n  name = \"Image Size\"\n  size = \"96, 123\"\n};","token_len":269,"entropy":[8.2919,2.5971,7.8824,3.3025,7.4866,3.3285,5.5151,4.0147,4.7608,3.1471,5.1394,3.7344,1.1559,5.4307,5.7795,5.7077,4.7993,4.8303,5.4168,1.5186,0.0552,6.1171,4.9785,3.2957,13.9567,6.2065,7.4503,1.3214,0.6689,5.5034,4.5046,4.7116,0.6162,0.7272,11.8875,2.5759,2.7074,0.0247,0.1023,11.9853,6.319,0.6373,0.1909,2.6642,7.9708,0.2824,0.0006,4.2709,2.9086,3.9507,9.4299,0.8539,15.0157,4.5839,4.0196,2.4553,7.3254,0.5481,17.1394,0.3467,3.0002,3.9044,0.4097,1.4794,0.1524,0.2107,8.8062,5.5175,0.2345,15.3406,0.0496,0.1193,0.1125,0.004,0.0525,6.4858,0.5544,0.8459,0.0473,12.5209,0.0563,0.0646,4.9277,0.0378,0.1947,8.2142,2.9137,9.2676,0.3759,0.0388,8.5539,0.0996,0.0659,6.8158,3.7458,0.0355,6.8654,5.2806,4.2809,0.0737,6.5085,7.153,0.7875,4.8187,6.7352,1.4654,0.0368,9.0052,0.1398,0.0749,5.0673,0.021,0.6215,4.414,2.4012,3.3161,7.3415,1.229,3.8969,1.7787,0.2047,0.1925,1.8824,0.2803,0.0284,10.3648,11.2987,0.7206,0.02,3.2013,3.1692,4.7873,0.9051,3.6702,3.1871,2.3232,2.2579,2.4115,4.3346,6.9525,5.5534,0.1383,2.962,4.5125,4.6313,4.0836,0.8027,4.7714,1.935,0.2093,6.3868,1.4606,4.8276,4.9097,1.3814,2.6177,6.934,2.5592,4.8165,6.4086,4.6102,4.7222,4.7419,5.8167,3.9165,1.1831,3.2778,0.0032,1.3782,1.815,2.6226,0.8913,3.0366,4.3998,4.5504,0.5649,0.0002,6.868,3.6394,2.4127,0.0002,5.2188,3.6371,0.003,4.0453,2.5206,2.8568,2.5565,2.281,6.1208,4.3226,4.597,4.3033,6.2923,4.5968,2.9594,2.2733,0.5894,3.2989,3.463,1.7433,3.8811,1.435,3.6951,3.9008,0.9816,1.0622,2.2066,0.3137,27.0268,0.2744,1.2464,12.1236,1.4303,0.0021,0.0534,0.1768,0.0552,0.9372,0.1146,0.0442,5.2785,3.0911,0.0006,0.0033,0.5679,0.0996,0.0386,0.0556,5.3017,6.648,0.0651,4.8576,3.6474,0.0488,15.1108,0.0352,0.0005,4.6599,0.2655,1.2396,8.8916,0.1726,0.0008,0.0262,0.0126,0.0019,1.2578,1.109,0.0814,7.6186,1.3379,0.0007,0.0145,1.8535,0.066,0.1141,0.1167,3.3595,0.5551,0.0227,5.6921,4.2149,3.2415,10.8515,2.088,0.465,13.3138]}

A mysterious doctor named Dr. Hiram Sato is conducting his own scientific experiment. To protect this secret, the Tokyo government has issued an edict that any person who finds out the location of the secret laboratory is to be executed. But in the middle of the police hunt for the secrets of Dr. Sato, one man decides not to be a part of the trial. His name is Kanichi. He is a teenage student, who is obsessed with an old anime called Kamen Rider which he has never watched but he is still a fan of. One day, he discovers that Dr.Sato's real name is Kamen Rider Taka. The reason why is because the government had also banned Kamen Rider. After all the government wanted to keep something hidden. To stop the government's order, Muto Sato, the owner of the Kamen Rider franchise, contacts Kanichi's mother, who works for Dr. Sato, and sends him to investigate. Kanichi has a secret skill that will help him in his investigation. He is able to see the past, present and the future of this person. But is it a secret ability or a curse? As he investigates, he will discover more secrets about Kamen Rider Taka and Dr. Sato.","token_len":269,"entropy":[11.4142,2.0934,0.653,2.2789,7.4397,1.419,2.8639,8.6303,3.5647,1.6812,3.8927,6.69,7.9211,2.6758,2.5662,0.2369,8.1686,0.8877,4.6372,4.7502,2.1694,4.6973,3.6347,1.3205,5.3694,2.2347,1.785,4.9978,3.917,4.5847,3.147,1.211,1.7074,7.289,5.3374,2.1323,4.6526,2.192,4.5075,0.0067,1.8341,4.2843,2.613,0.7687,4.8908,1.1004,2.2119,5.4035,0.0932,0.505,4.1599,1.9833,2.6816,0.5076,0.1499,3.263,0.4763,3.4069,4.0047,1.1269,5.2959,0.0276,0.8773,7.1343,5.0818,1.4082,0.8277,6.1195,1.063,1.6361,0.0039,0.2677,0.0003,0.6221,4.0262,3.0274,4.0851,6.7589,0.018,3.184,2.8165,3.6505,0.0053,0.6238,4.5359,0.7367,3.2867,1.8774,0.0735,5.6454,4.9582,3.5954,1.9945,1.2346,1.2493,6.593,2.9962,3.0952,2.1254,1.9531,4.6159,0.0629,4.7956,2.9977,6.0623,4.294,6.14,1.427,0.0798,4.3679,1.2004,2.1494,3.0866,2.3701,4.9524,2.9894,2.3237,4.1682,3.856,3.0461,0.3481,1.0666,4.3388,0.1718,0.5975,1.1733,2.9542,0.9843,3.9762,0.0092,6.0114,0.0011,2.0832,5.2543,0.4151,0.1052,4.384,0.189,0.1801,6.8388,4.3691,1.8597,2.7804,5.7123,1.7246,4.4159,1.4512,2.3861,5.9817,3.5908,6.3723,4.8116,3.9043,0.0021,0.0728,3.3328,4.1863,3.6155,3.7837,3.7296,3.5894,0.6438,3.0493,7.1751,4.1076,3.6654,4.2008,3.0496,1.4089,2.0523,1.8766,6.0152,0.6683,6.2807,4.3359,4.9097,0.232,2.8394,1.7318,5.4674,0.0567,0.2824,5.5572,0.0037,0.0811,6.4144,0.3394,6.9552,1.9797,0.1254,3.5661,2.2431,1.6951,1.5137,4.854,1.2037,4.8713,0.0172,0.7052,0.0007,2.7837,1.0583,4.4938,0.9423,0.6134,3.1179,1.29,3.4421,0.0045,3.163,2.202,3.3365,9.6579,1.5076,2.7458,1.811,0.1835,3.2283,0.8896,1.4348,0.4502,2.5424,2.1541,3.0389,0.0029,3.2953,1.2922,4.2409,2.3147,1.3104,0.6178,5.2133,0.062,0.9602,4.2558,5.7136,1.1293,3.0572,5.2066,1.6443,3.1225,1.7463,4.8189,1.3399,1.5127,3.5853,0.5402,4.5607,2.1306,2.7304,0.6948,0.8118,3.9177,2.3623,1.9947,2.7801,1.861,2.1254,0.0016,0.0132,2.1995,0.0045,2.0142,5.2353,0.0024,0.5129,0.0004,0.5372]}

If your name is included on the Honor Table you will win some goodies from the developer.","token_len":269,"entropy":[9.0511,5.8215,6.136,3.2852,3.8138,4.3647,7.2261,6.3084,0.0011,3.0167,8.4301,1.1368,3.3598,9.7625,7.6003,0.8842,2.714,0.5888,2.4393,7.3094,1.9579,1.6254,11.351,0.7694,8.0205,3.802,1.4345,9.8872,6.9519,0.9831,0.8035,1.3879,5.5223,0.9433,2.5965,3.6484,2.2132,5.0906,2.5165,8.8345,3.8528,1.0456,5.6899,0.1361,0.0192,5.5271,0.8892,6.9636,1.6777,7.6456,0.5098,6.1565,6.5354,6.6464,0.7849,3.2718,1.597,9.3471,0.0002,0.2845,6.2262,0.9355,1.2049,1.5748,5.719,8.4014,3.1128,6.8106,1.0727,6.3519,6.3163,0.8506,1.5262,3.0099,3.4717,3.6033,4.4493,4.7955,1.1199,1.9452,3.3716,2.6177,3.0826,4.8999,3.5103,0.8936,4.4501,2.1319,1.7355,0.6085,4.9025,0.6857,4.5854,3.6728,1.4376,2.2156,6.7414,3.863,2.1992,2.2357,3.3202,1.9529,5.9272,0.4065,3.2119,6.8822,6.512,1.8749,3.6111,5.75,4.8237,0.1763,1.3038,0.2457,0.8038,0.2175,1.3732,5.4931,3.4626,5.9024,10.1702,0.0189,5.5337,4.325,6.2895,2.0735,2.4669,0.7681,0.9761,4.0439,6.1012,1.2528,1.7684,2.7338,0.968,5.7023,2.9095,0.2859,2.7999,2.473,0.2142,1.614,2.6324,0.7573,6.0062,5.7141,2.483,1.3073,4.9531,0.8922,3.4824,2.3803,6.0527,4.0683,0.3463,1.2201,4.2119,0.3972,3.1429,2.3396,3.7184,2.5892,2.2355,2.7179,2.2378,6.3868,7.0921,1.9364,2.2939,4.6147,1.7414,5.2889,5.2089,2.7127,1.1451,4.6636,1.4172,0.9438,2.3616,3.4403,5.6892,1.242,0.4623,4.4035,2.2728,1.0471,0.7667,0.5072,0.0819,1.3564,6.3897,1.2886,3.3751,5.6486,0.0084,2.9442,0.3867,1.5507,1.5843,2.304,0.56,2.1662,2.4568,5.7654,1.6739,5.6593,6.6507,0.9424,2.5583,5.8748,3.8049,2.3737,7.0115,4.3032,5.4636,2.3418,6.0527,0.0705,1.9916,0.2578,2.1164,3.6265,2.9028,3.287,5.7584,2.6174,1.4837,3.2409,0.2347,3.1585,4.639,4.9035,1.1712,0.5277,2.5185,9.2084,0.3085,7.1701,5.6473,3.5751,4.8536,1.1331,5.9752,0.8571,3.469,4.3571,0.4385,7.2329,3.2191,1.4191,4.3964,3.2585,5.3579,0.4077,6.4844,1.4373,0.3081,8.8256,5.9938,2.0397,1.8693,2.006,4.8487,5.213,3.5443,0.5608,7.4476,0.9023]}

How do you go around this situation. The school rules can be used to protect you. How can they be used for your benefit. You must be able to think logically and not only act on instinct. The person you find that can help you must not be a student. How do you find them, what if you are asked about it? What if it is discovered that you have been there, should you tell the teacher. You need to make the decision how to follow the rules or break them. The more people you make aware of this, the more others can be tricked into taking the risk of breaking the rules. The teacher will not tell you who the whistleblower is and you might have to find out from the students themselves.","token_len":269,"entropy":[5.2846,3.5744,5.7824,0.1919,2.0474,4.356,4.4292,12.4153,5.5111,11.7737,5.442,4.3213,1.7087,2.571,2.9743,0.0005,4.5481,0.5107,0.7299,2.9912,6.022,5.6683,1.6901,5.6781,2.9675,7.2609,0.7847,2.8131,3.5899,1.5728,4.0893,0.1185,3.191,3.1859,2.0034,7.1956,1.21,5.3833,7.4084,1.0249,2.4387,5.6736,0.6378,0.8113,0.4869,2.104,2.9191,1.4568,1.7165,0.1628,1.3123,1.4202,4.8948,0.583,4.2624,0.8687,2.4359,1.9812,0.4653,2.838,1.5647,2.0622,4.0821,1.6169,10.2537,1.983,6.428,4.4614,2.0406,6.3219,0.2731,4.9031,1.8819,2.311,2.8043,4.807,0.4438,5.3777,0.6007,1.7861,3.3537,2.3806,2.6346,1.8547,3.4833,1.6001,3.2421,1.4269,5.9864,2.7857,3.1358,7.2936,0.5693,2.9702,0.1188,6.1325,0.003,0.1326,1.4891,7.0582,1.7916,5.5581,2.2597,0.269,3.231,1.1321,4.3779,3.1952,3.0838,1.8504,1.3192,3.4995,1.011,1.7692,2.9214,0.342,0.1403,1.8246,1.7777,0.6904,0.5501,5.6943,1.8289,0.246,3.5403,4.1604,3.4904,3.9144,4.994,3.214,3.127,5.7402,5.9818,0.6643,5.0941,1.0742,4.5039,1.2189,1.1032,4.4888,1.7681,3.3936,2.4075,0.5257,2.7943,2.9252,3.8449,2.2766,2.2113,4.1254,2.2001,2.664,0.01,5.1965,3.6689,1.283,4.144,4.939,3.8371,3.5852,3.3693,0.9663,2.7041,4.8154,2.2776,6.503,5.3486,3.507,1.8129,0.2304,4.8646,4.0855,1.3308,2.2227,5.2582,0.884,4.5195,1.5177,0.1079,3.6251,3.7123,3.9573,2.8984,5.8716,1.7758,2.1194,6.4604,4.3453,2.7317,0.9289,2.188,0.5602,3.1269,0.8721,5.9521,1.3015,1.3492,1.8823,1.6483,4.9514,2.5688,7.0763,0.4733,3.5156,1.539,0.7947,3.7755,2.4583,3.1781,0.2784,3.8155,2.6634,1.844,4.9189,0.9621,7.0322,1.5736,1.5542,4.2675,5.9307,0.4177,0.2921,2.3799,4.1144,3.1181,1.7078,5.033,5.3088,0.1933,2.3688,1.0662,0.0154,0.5956,6.2763,3.323,2.0495,5.5779,0.9706,4.2061,2.7252,3.9385,1.211,4.6638,0.5756,0.2875,0.3087,2.1365,3.7351,2.4437,3.1591,3.0592,0.1211,4.2961,2.5742,9.1388,0.1525,2.4127,2.4281,4.8273,2.623,0.3851,4.1131,0.9259,4.2464,1.2426,4.748,3.1846,0.4473]}

That\u2019s what I want to know! After a few minutes of thinking, the villains are defeated and the heroes survive.\nThis week we have a lot going on. In addition to the storylines from our weekly comics, we have a few surprise items. You will find a short story about the time I made a film with Tom Arnold and it included a very strange character. The story is by Joe Barry and the drawings (and some of my dialogue) were made by the incomparable Mike Mignola.\nOne of the characters I did in that production, was called the Dork. He is a member of the Fringe Brigade. This week\u2019s post is dedicated to one of the biggest fans of my work. If you haven\u2019t seen his comments in a few previous posts, he is named Ken. I would like to say KEN (but I know people that have trouble with the name); Ken has been an avid reader of my stories and I owe him a lot. He has been an interesting character with some strange ideas.\nIf you had told him he would see Tom Arnold in the film, he would have probably laughed at you! He was quite surprised to find out his name was in the movie.","token_len":270,"entropy":[9.3162,11.4868,3.4966,5.1947,4.7149,3.0679,4.2263,8.0406,6.0998,0.4439,3.7409,3.2121,0.0081,1.4158,5.275,2.362,3.2054,5.6831,16.3335,8.3734,2.9738,2.4922,2.2965,2.8413,0.392,0.4546,2.9172,6.973,2.7506,3.0951,2.4263,0.8211,4.7696,1.0677,2.9431,6.5191,2.4551,3.8828,1.1273,1.5635,4.0479,7.3501,0.5956,2.6019,6.804,4.8435,2.2632,2.3277,1.689,4.2345,3.837,0.1134,1.9608,4.0451,3.2078,0.0782,1.3295,7.3892,3.3788,3.3982,5.5763,5.2945,1.4381,0.7979,1.2437,1.2586,2.9581,7.9159,3.9333,1.8873,4.3684,2.8391,1.5188,2.2625,4.9371,1.9966,2.6178,1.8551,6.0645,4.3907,4.3041,1.642,5.5407,2.844,5.0277,5.7963,1.5668,4.9865,6.1274,1.0411,4.0619,5.4022,4.2589,2.1732,2.856,2.118,1.8757,6.2073,5.7332,6.9494,1.4099,3.2809,8.3016,5.7651,2.4918,3.1946,1.8473,3.1032,6.974,0.3193,1.8661,3.1513,0.6375,3.6154,7.8727,0.05,4.7813,4.4917,0.2749,0.0144,0.461,1.8937,4.6345,0.4887,0.3928,3.6546,2.1369,4.2818,5.0991,3.3163,7.5517,2.9556,3.8921,4.6879,2.6094,5.4833,5.6597,1.3423,2.0109,1.6839,0.8314,5.6089,0.0086,0.525,7.5374,1.3906,6.4161,1.5327,3.7622,4.8539,12.9262,0.2299,2.3009,6.132,1.3349,4.1752,0.0366,4.1275,0.1732,1.2351,5.3658,4.3175,0.3619,3.0202,0.6893,1.4239,4.9477,0.1098,2.7194,2.6146,0.5574,0.0798,1.0997,3.378,8.364,3.2012,3.3421,2.7063,8.493,1.1392,0.3224,3.5574,1.5173,8.0363,9.0502,1.7039,2.3689,3.9877,0.733,0.0644,3.2108,8.9567,4.4983,5.3072,6.0536,1.7334,4.3982,5.331,4.0923,2.6915,9.1627,2.1354,2.4819,2.6354,5.1891,4.2413,2.8904,1.2586,3.1779,2.1899,1.5211,0.3092,1.1376,3.6274,1.2956,2.3342,7.0057,0.2589,1.2012,0.6959,1.5803,2.0351,1.8712,1.6102,2.9249,5.0118,1.6227,5.2967,2.5494,4.9541,3.1815,1.5146,1.7137,4.2672,0.1264,4.9456,4.4941,4.334,3.979,2.1097,6.6921,8.8439,0.3869,2.7734,1.6072,2.4039,0.5319,0.6662,0.1825,0.4632,4.0089,2.8482,1.5323,1.5699,3.6491,2.5589,2.5588,4.8912,4.5664,1.7923,1.9684,0.4954,4.9403,0.9931,0.7156,3.0674,0.5821,2.5777,0.9783]}

What are the words that express the meaning of the word, in the dictionary? A definition? In order for something to qualify for a vocabulary, we must understand the meaning. We must know the meaning of the word in order for it to be able to be understood. When we make a new discovery, we need a word for the new concept.

The censorship tells us more than the actual writing. It\u2019s how the story is told.\nA great American movie writer is George Furth who wrote the movie \u201cGoodfellas\u201d with Martin Scorcese. He never intended the movie to be shown \u201cuncensored\u201d, but it was. So you see. Great writers don\u2019t write the books for you. They write them the way they want them to be read.\nIt is hard to read a good book when the characters get no privacy, the love affair between the heroine and hero in \u201cAugust\u201d seemed like a romance, but he is her employer and she gets fired when she goes out with him.\nThe best story telling is in the non-fiction writing. Take Hemingway\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d. He wrote the entire book in a hotel room and it is a novel. Many of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s works that are classified as \u201cnon fiction\u201d are better than the fiction.\nTake a look at the great British novelist, Joseph Conrad. Look at \u201cTwenty One Pilots\u201d. His account of \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d is a great example of how literature can make you see the world around you.","token_len":274,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0791,2.6428,2.9884,6.6848,4.8186,1.8597,4.3414,5.2063,8.722,1.3669,3.2245,3.6516,2.8102,3.9563,6.259,0.9042,1.7467,15.5715,7.9971,0.9454,4.019,2.1138,1.9272,1.1527,1.0664,0.6837,2.0692,8.3814,5.0173,7.922,5.0346,5.2161,2.1105,7.8131,8.528,3.6359,5.3968,2.3112,1.9277,4.3985,7.9745,4.3788,9.0217,1.1749,0.0,0.436,7.4195,4.2124,6.7156,5.2154,0.018,0.0009,0.9677,2.2013,5.5431,3.8503,2.9365,0.9923,0.2228,0.3523,6.1074,4.5521,0.1559,8.9315,0.0043,0.0001,1.0605,2.3763,3.4837,1.0086,2.5227,1.3351,3.0291,3.8532,4.3629,2.5028,3.7587,7.3213,4.2818,3.439,2.457,2.4156,0.1712,3.1082,3.3643,4.6992,3.3233,4.383,0.8228,1.3539,1.3684,2.7905,5.912,0.5045,1.2832,1.3268,1.8749,0.3309,0.349,3.3899,0.4746,1.5062,4.0178,2.0858,4.0327,0.4177,3.6763,1.356,3.6628,1.3012,2.0743,2.7025,3.6376,5.8923,6.5658,8.5366,2.3149,3.8815,7.0743,5.6417,3.0772,1.523,4.3122,0.1903,5.4144,5.3608,7.8584,0.2124,9.5667,2.8799,1.5845,9.8061,3.1298,0.9295,6.5955,2.143,1.6222,5.5148,4.6353,8.3422,8.6591,1.868,1.5928,4.9453,7.2478,2.6331,0.8008,3.4516,3.0689,1.7794,0.6959,0.6117,1.7051,2.5683,4.3867,3.7827,6.1389,1.3906,3.7923,0.9879,6.9792,0.7769,0.5894,4.4749,1.2732,6.9775,7.1715,0.0185,0.0,1.3463,1.8226,1.0251,4.5501,0.5159,6.0053,0.8179,0.794,0.8392,1.2901,1.8808,2.5062,1.8377,1.9359,4.6619,2.1005,2.7675,2.6145,8.7828,0.2183,2.8562,2.7374,2.4233,2.4077,3.9015,0.8363,6.6755,1.6912,10.5731,0.0213,0.0042,0.0016,1.0328,0.1557,0.0104,2.5568,6.0511,1.1648,5.6462,0.4301,5.1401,0.0928,4.2124,5.3462,1.1275,0.4552,0.7644,6.4731,1.167,2.0729,4.2187,1.9441,1.2665,5.264,3.3473,1.9013,0.0882,1.6906,5.0345,5.0373,3.0954,1.8832,5.1079,1.615,2.3821,6.8809,0.2368,6.3451,0.0753,8.1044,4.3943,1.3516,0.576,0.2816,1.6037,0.5526,3.6335,7.0443,0.3235,3.8435,0.0296,7.1914,1.128,0.2426,0.2304,0.1076,0.7897,2.0161,1.6453,2.1591,0.6029,3.256,6.3094,1.3127,3.6495,2.1069,5.4377,1.6215,0.6708,4.9147,0.0199,0.9897]}

After extensive research, scientists have concluded that the pandemic initially began through restaurant staff, people responsible for touching food but who are not allowed sick days. The food from the unhygienic kitchen of the restaurant is eventually passed to the consumers via a chain of contamination that involves many human and animal intermediaries. It has now been found that the virus is transmitted through the food chain in which the virus infects the food animal in its gut.\nAll around the world, this virus has now taken many lives including the deadliest of all, the COVID. According to scientists, the main risk for infected people to start getting extremely high, is the consumption of contaminated ingredients. The virus is transmitted via the air and when the infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks, the droplets fall on the food material and infect those that eat the food. The virus remains in the food material and when the food is consumed, it becomes highly contaminated and the risk of catching the disease becomes extremely high.\nAlthough there has been a lot of research, scientists still do not agree on the source of the virus. Some have mentioned that the virus was probably manufactured in the lab and was accidentally released into the atmosphere. Some experts have said that the virus is natural and the restaurant staff accidentally carried it to them.","token_len":275,"entropy":[12.3372,0.6373,2.8993,4.8678,2.6811,2.0913,1.0066,1.2171,0.0315,0.9699,6.2634,7.8144,1.5062,0.7571,2.7951,0.8679,2.5482,0.1462,1.6983,2.578,0.0052,9.3229,2.4267,6.4895,11.6499,6.7497,2.8303,5.989,8.6431,0.059,8.778,2.5889,6.5508,3.7307,3.2065,2.6057,4.776,11.3013,2.1967,1.7137,2.1431,4.2765,6.5416,1.5636,7.2938,4.7835,0.0086,0.0001,0.0021,4.9575,4.4834,1.7661,3.0338,1.7716,6.5721,3.9377,1.3523,1.274,6.1719,5.2564,1.9962,5.1663,0.5985,8.7026,3.6847,5.1837,5.5764,4.7063,2.2613,0.1934,10.0114,0.25,0.4825,3.7373,2.7489,3.8214,1.9184,2.7264,0.3605,1.6988,4.2431,1.7925,2.3313,0.8964,1.9389,2.7415,2.7313,3.7079,5.9893,1.536,6.2073,4.0522,0.0064,1.5461,2.5972,8.387,3.8707,3.4345,6.0773,0.7202,1.4143,12.8994,5.1355,0.3441,0.1061,0.4392,5.366,3.5222,0.8833,4.9724,5.063,5.797,2.4576,4.9318,2.0648,9.3305,2.7651,0.6078,3.078,1.5551,10.9072,10.4037,3.1614,4.4685,0.0039,3.8746,0.6937,1.3689,6.2759,5.282,2.5246,5.0274,1.5591,3.4205,5.8621,4.1574,9.1085,4.6493,6.1958,5.9129,2.1918,5.7084,0.0688,2.3009,6.3819,1.2048,1.9947,3.3426,1.4943,3.1565,2.645,1.6984,4.7202,2.1914,6.678,2.104,4.0144,0.3614,4.4066,0.0178,1.367,3.6519,0.0599,0.0001,0.7729,4.5305,7.6167,1.1912,1.4488,6.4673,0.4336,4.4227,2.0742,1.0155,2.9346,6.5339,1.801,4.0193,4.914,3.0722,2.549,1.8911,0.6199,0.5766,1.6984,2.4753,6.2824,1.2644,0.6496,1.5514,3.172,2.0223,3.6039,1.3519,1.2939,0.9444,3.1332,0.586,0.9261,3.1815,3.2346,3.0375,1.8074,2.8521,5.1754,0.8901,4.6886,0.8369,2.6273,4.1556,2.897,0.1305,0.1283,0.9555,5.1361,2.7616,2.3058,0.1598,1.6999,2.7377,0.0506,1.8434,2.4662,4.4207,2.1639,1.9643,0.0112,5.5393,0.5555,0.9514,4.2775,0.2014,0.1411,0.8055,0.6665,2.609,2.9687,6.8366,0.734,1.272,1.4021,1.9067,4.9263,5.5862,1.8076,1.9563,4.6522,2.0411,3.2265,6.0709,2.4025,1.3211,0.1784,2.8372,1.2631,3.2721,3.9605,1.3062,2.1846,0.1255,0.9482,1.2035,1.8283,6.1171,1.1719,3.3444,7.9376,2.5695,7.2152,6.4281,0.8024,2.7901,5.2521,0.853]}

{"prompt":"Cutting your hair hurts just as much as cutting your skin .","text":"Cutting your hair hurts just as much as cutting your skin. When it comes to grooming the hair, you have to know what to do so you won\u2019t cause an injury to your hair when you\u2019re trying to maintain it. The most effective method is to start at the very beginning and cut the hair so that there will be some length. There is still enough skin left to be able to do this effectively.\nWhen cutting your skin, you can be fairly careful and ensure that the cut is always the same. You can learn about cutting technique by reading magazines. Many magazines have helpful tips on how to cut the skin. Keep in mind that the shorter you cut your hair, the more sensitive you will have to care for your skin. You must learn everything you can about skin care so you can properly treat it.\nIn conclusion, cut your hair gently, so that it isn\u2019t going to harm your skin. It\u2019s a very good thing and you can get very good results in the long run. In the meantime, keep your skin well hydrated, or you will have even more problems. If you have problems with skin problems, you can still cut your hair without the problem. You do need to know how to protect yourself from problems, but the truth is that there is no reason not to cut your own hair.","token_len":276,"entropy":[7.529,4.3911,2.9494,8.4878,6.1624,1.1565,0.2765,0.8024,2.3831,0.5401,3.5891,0.6061,4.2103,2.6113,1.6367,0.0727,4.9772,3.6533,1.4834,0.6896,1.9248,3.0338,0.3364,3.8814,1.5482,1.4798,0.6025,4.9446,0.9697,3.4392,15.8515,7.118,4.1173,5.5007,3.9967,2.1488,2.0839,0.5774,1.0222,4.4595,0.7363,12.7166,0.2835,1.7035,3.5493,0.0607,5.2501,1.9521,0.6408,3.648,3.3358,2.7167,2.2995,1.3003,0.4834,4.3586,3.6916,0.591,4.2948,1.379,1.8272,4.5789,2.688,0.7694,6.0021,0.9978,3.8093,3.0304,0.163,4.3649,4.4388,2.6832,4.5867,1.4849,5.4779,4.4401,3.2316,3.2137,1.3519,3.777,3.1455,0.0032,3.7007,1.3181,5.9838,0.7627,1.9073,7.053,3.5215,1.1036,3.5604,0.4563,1.563,2.8571,5.2336,5.3583,5.287,3.7103,6.2003,0.3397,1.7591,2.9479,1.6291,5.4186,3.6142,0.5576,1.2882,2.5537,1.3819,5.899,3.1918,3.4931,5.5747,1.7402,2.0825,8.5213,2.4577,4.9902,3.7253,2.0818,5.3281,1.0848,0.9935,0.7682,0.025,1.1644,3.2334,1.4249,1.2135,5.6782,0.5097,0.0177,0.247,2.5425,6.7922,2.0291,0.3939,1.307,0.2964,0.3438,0.0205,1.022,4.5764,2.1816,0.6009,5.5604,0.2587,10.6722,0.1099,1.4866,1.6516,0.3836,2.9912,3.7207,4.2621,6.1224,0.9584,0.3151,0.4647,4.1373,0.5139,2.3287,1.0181,0.6984,4.6362,3.2948,1.5474,0.5823,0.9043,4.1114,4.8265,0.2096,4.7241,0.7548,0.1523,4.9871,2.1714,4.1037,0.3831,0.9453,5.013,2.4063,0.1911,0.748,5.5863,0.395,6.3367,1.1667,1.6489,0.4772,2.6745,3.9972,0.0207,1.8566,2.5094,2.5083,2.2304,2.6241,3.9865,2.0391,1.8852,3.4919,4.5949,1.4836,0.2787,3.5817,1.7999,0.8934,0.365,0.3487,4.7043,1.3247,2.0981,0.1323,3.2056,2.021,3.0496,4.2199,2.9856,0.0003,2.02,6.6973,1.4575,1.1318,1.9304,6.0965,1.2264,0.781,0.8974,3.1799,0.245,1.5521,3.8587,0.7262,3.1855,3.897,0.6525,1.9052,0.919,5.6615,5.2449,0.3957,0.0519,3.8169,4.0573,3.2324,0.7149,3.1897,4.5402,2.4542,0.1195,2.1441,1.4169,0.1263,5.9194,1.7273,1.0087,3.9472,2.4888,1.6586,3.25,5.1852,0.0566,0.6364,3.1002,1.3813,1.0579,4.8938,2.6552,0.0043,2.5722,0.2232,4.9525,0.0567,0.7933]}

You come across a man covered head to toe in disfiguring marks, speaking with a woman who bears only a single scar. The woman is the survivor, the man is the victim.\nThis is only an example of the ways the world sees us. We feel ashamed of our scars. We pretend they don't exist. And when we finally do talk about them, usually in an interview with someone who isn't one of ourselves, we assume that we're just as interesting.\nAs a consequence, most people keep their scars secret. I guess one of the biggest accomplishments of scar therapy is to help us see them as something that are ok to share and explore.\nI first got interested in scar treatment around 2005 when I saw an ad in the local paper for a scar clinic in Las Vegas called Scarless. I found their website via a search engine.\nYou can click on a link and get to that ad. The ad was still live in February of 2015. Now, not only do I have access to all of those websites listed on there, a lot of the content they have is free and I can link to them from my website.\nA lot of them are small non profit organizations, some are part of medical schools, some are owned by individuals.","token_len":276,"entropy":[10.2377,2.9445,8.2953,3.2329,1.699,0.1926,1.6051,8.3763,1.9875,2.3075,3.7204,5.0121,1.5195,3.6691,0.0137,1.7635,4.9931,1.8598,5.5333,8.5692,2.207,2.1081,4.397,7.3424,6.9381,0.4862,0.7212,1.0744,7.4919,3.5827,0.2325,6.5773,1.6697,11.1278,2.44,1.2924,4.9262,1.9308,7.3731,5.523,1.1294,2.6359,3.1434,1.6,2.4782,4.1837,1.889,3.626,6.0651,1.7079,2.1996,2.7204,1.629,0.2116,2.409,0.4761,1.5207,9.6631,1.2106,5.4445,3.5889,1.5649,0.4772,1.1794,4.8419,2.9888,4.0342,3.9381,2.9433,0.7351,2.2709,5.4368,5.6225,1.656,2.0684,5.8725,1.1349,0.7066,6.9364,2.1117,1.6825,0.0005,0.0947,0.4767,3.8823,2.6793,0.7492,5.3873,1.9414,5.9135,0.7495,0.5556,0.3526,6.3086,2.8385,3.1186,5.0112,2.0068,2.6027,1.3125,4.7951,0.0011,4.6521,0.1458,9.6608,0.2245,0.544,4.981,1.3613,1.5751,1.3939,3.2214,2.9401,8.4464,2.9949,1.2325,4.2651,1.6407,4.77,0.325,3.7466,1.1962,5.7468,2.6019,0.5424,2.736,0.9912,3.8086,5.1554,5.2049,0.6273,0.1992,2.8656,8.1093,0.2216,6.1637,5.6803,0.2932,1.872,3.1224,2.9203,3.31,5.0873,1.008,2.5957,1.6667,5.4698,9.392,2.8986,3.0865,2.9063,6.6671,0.6652,1.7066,2.4947,5.6317,3.6635,2.4254,0.041,0.7181,3.5571,5.6746,3.392,1.4156,0.383,4.2369,2.4234,4.2118,1.7867,1.2178,2.6539,0.8846,2.2358,0.7756,3.9359,3.6978,1.5951,5.4421,0.0094,2.9598,4.5844,6.9087,1.8207,1.5216,4.0271,4.9395,0.9537,7.8572,1.5764,2.3767,2.6974,1.6673,2.4111,4.4422,1.0645,3.7565,0.499,2.0041,2.1437,2.0757,2.921,2.571,4.0427,5.6141,0.8375,2.2501,2.7428,2.2545,7.2103,5.0333,2.8451,4.5222,0.5526,4.5737,0.9456,5.8002,1.0949,5.5351,1.1827,2.2527,0.8602,1.6157,3.1511,0.021,3.1823,1.1321,4.8087,6.2814,6.2627,1.5389,4.4148,0.2277,7.0282,1.9753,0.1072,2.8271,4.954,4.6465,2.2939,1.3775,4.7049,2.1004,2.2998,1.4044,4.7818,0.3668,1.361,3.3078,1.6262,3.3431,0.8492,1.1177,4.4915,1.9186,0.0281,3.6795,1.1122,6.3586,8.334,6.6221,3.4397,1.987,3.8179,1.5707,6.1684,0.0859,5.893,3.7301,0.9169,0.387,0.4146,5.5303,0.2069,3.8211,1.6204]}

These scenes represent periods where treason was most likely to strike, and where you may encounter your assassins. Each of these scenes has'story-boards' where you and your companions can discuss a variety of possible events that could take place, and you may be requested to answer a variety of hypothetical 'what if' questions.\nThis is particularly helpful when it comes to planning the safest route to take to reach the person you are monitoring on any given mission. It saves you from having to re-think your route in order to avoid a potential assassination attempt while also giving you an opportunity to gather more info regarding the person you're monitoring (which can be a useful technique in several other games).","token_len":276,"entropy":[3.8828,6.7105,0.0496,1.3976,7.8054,2.044,3.3256,7.3771,9.8975,3.2436,0.3173,3.7387,10.3571,2.1128,6.2613,4.0421,1.2262,2.5247,0.58,4.1874,6.2864,0.1933,2.8578,2.9836,0.3031,6.6991,0.0857,2.6236,2.5965,2.1786,1.2492,5.4235,1.1798,9.0106,1.8164,3.1236,0.6449,1.6328,10.7433,7.3142,2.9542,4.679,6.0788,0.8438,0.5206,3.9462,3.1745,1.4274,1.9436,2.3632,4.6795,1.5507,4.2329,1.7086,13.6715,2.5428,3.5951,0.0466,5.4733,6.7983,1.9766,0.3978,0.7115,3.096,1.2198,1.5808,5.4892,3.5111,1.069,6.4078,2.0122,4.3878,2.3975,3.5997,3.2944,2.1747,3.6009,5.7344,6.1492,2.0251,5.1517,7.1233,5.3727,1.6261,7.9005,1.8208,2.367,4.1379,4.7621,9.3734,1.8259,0.7646,5.3467,1.1468,0.7641,4.2449,0.1022,1.3385,3.2196,1.1346,2.4246,2.4023,5.1301,5.3562,0.8935,3.302,4.3446,0.1432,0.0296,0.0361,3.6024,2.8012,5.109,1.8762,0.0603,1.0667,0.8097,0.5195,0.5654,2.5087,1.9937,2.7782,4.124,10.0324,11.5284,3.9824,8.634,6.1193,5.0072,3.0142,0.4772,5.1047,0.556,3.8547,5.641,2.1219,3.1123,2.6267,5.8144,7.6495,2.426,8.5521,2.9013,3.951,0.6844,0.8618,1.6191,1.2042,1.001,2.168,1.5107,2.8577,3.1438,4.5602,8.0799,1.1884,4.21,1.8714,0.1666,0.2078,2.3505,9.8521,7.8064,8.5388,5.1641,10.7729,4.7748,4.9121,0.4128,3.3299,0.1449,5.8841,1.3687,4.2759,4.223,4.3495,0.0078,3.5803,3.1366,2.2378,1.5296,3.3775,0.0123,2.8962,1.3556,3.8204,2.2994,2.4646,8.8025,0.0945,5.2943,2.2417,2.6659,0.0101,5.8665,7.5587,3.4395,1.0185,1.7344,0.4032,0.8128,0.7456,3.3158,1.4274,4.8703,3.4577,1.4264,2.4601,0.0374,0.0192,4.145,3.3476,8.2956,1.9973,1.1408,3.3652,1.9273,4.0231,0.9685,7.9946,1.0376,2.3421,9.6192,4.5233,5.9512,0.3604,2.4608,0.3372,3.3442,7.2612,0.9572,1.8599,1.2225,0.0435,5.0216,0.638,2.8701,0.939,3.899,3.1733,1.7209,0.1079,2.9139,2.945,3.6372,0.8565,2.3232,5.1012,4.3004,2.7637,0.1501,2.6275,1.5068,0.0668,5.1155,3.0841,3.7104,4.972,1.2426,1.9699,0.5482,1.9411,1.8878,3.9443,3.6104,2.1936,1.3778,2.3716,4.019,5.6077,1.9221,6.9464,3.8672,2.8005,0.8779]}

There are a few videos on Youtube that show how to play and what things do :","token_len":277,"entropy":[3.8828,5.5276,0.2885,0.6749,2.6518,3.3914,2.7274,8.7695,1.04,0.0045,0.0005,10.9093,0.0041,0.0433,2.3235,0.8358,0.3227,1.3266,4.5321,0.1153,1.381,1.2766,1.6186,1.5794,0.0273,0.0953,0.6184,11.9907,6.395,0.0029,0.0182,3.3012,1.3588,10.397,0.9887,0.5259,0.0034,0.0273,0.0057,6.6326,1.9443,1.0538,12.8982,4.1038,7.9464,1.6725,1.7114,5.9446,0.7436,1.8329,0.0109,0.0011,2.9852,3.345,2.4679,7.9326,4.418,4.2428,2.6306,4.0767,0.7457,4.02,4.4701,7.0373,3.021,0.4233,2.5165,7.0626,5.1136,4.8143,2.914,2.955,6.402,1.5706,5.1851,3.9504,1.1064,6.7159,1.0909,1.5046,3.3126,3.9297,4.2583,5.312,0.9279,1.2525,5.3302,2.9806,1.2112,6.2648,2.0379,2.2669,3.3941,1.3902,7.1518,0.0233,8.3888,5.7378,0.1706,0.462,1.7897,2.6686,3.8097,0.7416,5.5825,2.0891,2.45,0.5309,0.9366,4.7971,1.8043,2.4602,4.0209,0.4626,0.6221,6.4484,1.8118,1.5263,4.7271,0.8935,1.0226,3.0783,0.6117,2.5915,2.6526,1.5808,3.7002,0.5513,0.9673,0.7331,3.7349,4.9925,2.7919,0.759,1.9104,5.1526,5.566,2.2317,5.5991,0.5391,5.1662,2.3836,2.5888,0.5289,5.4888,3.7174,3.9826,3.9116,2.2739,0.323,8.7052,2.4425,2.9959,5.3572,0.4881,0.2123,3.1604,5.4968,2.3248,3.3793,0.5573,5.1035,4.7951,2.5626,0.1441,2.4388,0.8998,1.5105,4.5744,0.3984,3.0744,1.7916,0.0276,0.2947,0.8116,3.0606,6.8961,3.3037,0.0454,2.7619,0.4034,1.6649,1.6299,3.4806,0.2487,1.8506,2.8875,5.4024,1.0856,4.5223,12.1167,0.4631,3.9357,3.5856,8.9415,1.9534,2.3734,7.1791,2.4385,2.8446,0.4696,0.7876,1.848,5.6509,2.0207,5.3772,4.8023,2.5219,5.5492,3.2222,0.276,3.9033,5.2469,0.7014,0.7952,1.6329,3.3878,2.9343,6.6847,3.3264,2.5594,1.6905,5.515,2.4227,0.2357,2.3881,4.0818,7.5147,4.0371,4.1613,0.437,4.69,4.4371,3.0525,4.8919,0.3534,0.2138,0.9547,2.5536,5.0439,0.7516,1.5887,0.9999,7.347,0.1733,0.2564,1.2654,2.1369,5.0057,1.779,1.2359,1.1825,1.623,2.6268,1.1627,0.6702,13.3099,3.7977,1.1194,3.0704,0.6765,2.4827,1.0243,7.5049,2.0772,2.5471,1.8856,1.3754,1.4839,0.4538,2.8146,3.1787,4.1818,6.414,3.0031,7.5961]}

You find a old music box. It plays and releases a lovely melody. The box is broken because of the years and you can't move it with your powers.\nYou can not read minds. You are not magic. When you play it, another magic appears. This melody is about a girl who can travel through time and space, but she can't stop running away to save her heart. Her name is Lila Gray. You are told that she is a dead girl, but when you see her there, you think she is not. She is still a girl in love with a boy called Daniel. He can't speak, but he loves her. Her name is Jena and she can travel with the music box. Daniel is a vampire with his powers of time and space. But he is in love with his dead sister.\nThis is the beginning of a time where music and magic are two elements that form the core of it all. It's a fantastic universe building, and a really interesting story to follow. I am really intrigued by this book.

Write a review trashing the non-existent book .","text":"The latest best seller is about a Nobel Prize winning chemist who is also an axe-wielding serial killer. Write a review trashing the non-existent book. Now that's a good plan. But the reviewer is also a woman so how did you go with that one?\nI always get worried these days about being a big, old boy on the book blogosphere. I read a lot of YA and a lot of non-fiction and I'm not really known as a horror\/sci-fi enthusiast to be honest (though some of the genre is pretty close at hand). So I often worry that my posts could offend or alienate someone, especially if I were to go off on a tangent with my reviews or digress. I'm certainly well aware that my posts do have a tendency to digress and that's part of the fun. A commenter who doesn't like to be challenged is not always one who would like to be challenged, and someone who is ready to fight can easily find something to upset them in this unrealistic world of the digital. So I try not to put that at all, and I try not to get carried away with the topic of a post. After all, if I were to tell you to get a life with no comment, you would call me a dictator, and I'm not that kind of person, so why bother?","token_len":278,"entropy":[7.7734,8.6163,3.4047,1.6995,6.2912,2.0337,10.997,0.9621,2.8456,3.3046,1.5104,3.0248,4.4027,2.9918,8.9233,1.422,0.8798,0.0595,5.7542,0.0616,0.8146,10.3293,2.6306,0.5413,15.137,2.4957,1.8301,8.376,0.2449,3.872,4.9843,2.3682,6.8046,3.039,1.7108,1.1166,3.1684,8.9829,0.41,4.4961,3.3144,6.8917,1.8977,3.7416,1.7005,6.3028,5.7734,5.5842,3.8781,1.8977,4.7125,4.7257,1.1992,4.0248,0.2406,1.3181,7.2069,5.8385,3.9626,7.3517,7.8409,0.6004,1.2029,3.4607,2.4635,5.5491,3.4701,5.7033,5.9377,3.6821,1.1973,5.9349,7.7273,1.6656,0.5659,1.5258,4.8598,1.9678,0.424,0.1627,8.1362,0.2139,2.7269,4.9219,0.2735,0.0487,4.103,0.041,3.0715,1.8649,1.3182,2.3037,1.9254,3.1139,5.9477,3.6557,0.379,6.4304,4.4129,2.0394,0.0608,0.0021,5.359,5.9526,2.9077,0.496,4.8894,3.0888,4.4589,0.7409,1.5702,4.9696,4.0935,2.6855,6.347,4.528,4.2797,0.5676,2.078,0.8966,6.1557,6.1847,0.9705,2.5497,6.6713,3.959,5.7181,3.5642,4.2735,0.0024,4.1656,2.5936,2.37,1.2562,1.2479,4.6816,1.8856,3.6116,3.2652,1.4767,0.937,0.8154,0.0088,4.1306,3.8235,5.8835,2.3113,8.4346,4.0109,1.423,1.9942,2.1691,5.137,6.6795,0.4058,0.9972,2.6374,3.5729,4.4029,2.7927,1.4817,2.776,0.0722,6.7995,0.6767,1.9417,3.2621,2.3717,4.2045,0.0034,0.7167,1.749,1.0635,5.1844,6.8619,2.5838,4.415,0.0006,1.5218,2.626,2.6375,4.4677,3.0896,3.1184,4.3862,5.0932,2.1383,4.1984,2.0123,0.1136,1.2391,0.2891,2.1329,2.0968,6.7511,0.1833,2.0618,6.6256,0.1822,5.5073,4.6435,4.0572,3.0915,4.761,1.5351,5.9598,1.7859,3.9623,4.2288,13.124,1.1106,1.7699,2.7739,6.1536,2.0118,2.6089,1.2013,3.171,2.269,0.0033,4.2555,4.7626,5.2692,3.6318,4.0275,1.7307,1.642,1.9803,0.971,0.0049,2.8941,4.7222,0.0005,1.1733,1.7069,5.6733,1.8844,3.1257,2.1987,1.1,6.1904,0.811,0.1304,2.6375,1.282,2.988,0.7225,5.2503,0.7898,3.3163,3.8684,2.966,5.5457,4.0223,3.7828,7.8927,1.2697,1.412,1.854,6.0522,0.4923,0.8672,8.8431,2.1006,1.3893,1.2079,1.9485,1.1077,3.957,1.4998,0.0169,0.8748,3.0359,1.5035,3.4621,1.9388,1.258]}

Forget about the \"freedom \", \"love\" (as we know) and \"knowledge\" in their view, it's only the most humble way to live. I personally think that a pair of philosophical rednecks are indeed extremely good examples, I highly recommend reading the book.\nThis is a movie that has a very strong point against socialist and communist societies. It has a very strong message, but it has little to say about Western society. I wouldn't mind to buy it for an exam, but I've seen it so often there would be a strong competition for tickets. The movie is also short: 65 minutes!\nThis movie has been very popular in the U.S., it is a good topic for English classes. I recommend it because it is a good study tool on political philosophy in the U.S. - a movie on the topic of Western society. The movie is extremely popular, so you do not have to worry about going without it.\nthis book is a short book written by J.D.Sampson, it explains the main principles of classical liberalism by using two main characters: Socrates and Plato.

Sometimes they project a story that is far more accurate, or far more interesting than their personal experience. Even so it is usually the shared experience that keeps that relationship running long, and if you are both willing to be willing to listen, and learn from each other, then you have no reason to end up on the same page, and in the same place. You must have a clear definition of what you and your soulmate are looking for. If you come across anyone who seems to fit that description, then go see them. Do not be afraid to say that the soulmates that you are looking for, do not require a conventional wedding. In fact this is probably the only way that they will be truly happy, if they feel that they have a choice even to call each other so. This may sound silly, but in our busy world we have all too often accepted the dictates of traditions that no longer serve us. It could be that you are afraid to ask your soulmate if they are willing to be ready for such a move. If you are willing to take the risk, you can always say, I am only going to take one step.

The story is set in 1969 and it takes as the story of a young guard who wakes up in a strange building with no memory of the night before, and the rest of the world, when suddenly, King Kong is at the Empire State Building. You must find out whats happened to you, and figure out a way out of the building alive. I have played this game on my pc, ps3 and xbox360, it is well made graphics, the controls are perfect. A good time was had with this game.\nThis game is a little difficult to explain, it's a horror story based on the movie King Kong, the story takes place in 1968 and you are a security worker in the Empire State Building. You wake up one day and you have no memory of your previous day, but you remember the monster at the Empire State building. You must find out where you are, what has happened to you and figure out how to get home without getting eaten alive. This is a great game, with good graphics and a good soundtrack. The story is a little hard to understand at first but after play through the first few levels the story makes perfect sense and is really good. I love this game and recommend it.","token_len":281,"entropy":[3.0338,3.2989,2.9531,7.3428,1.0558,5.6209,3.8652,2.4908,1.4081,11.066,2.2837,3.6116,1.3439,6.581,1.4872,0.1637,1.8042,12.551,0.4127,0.0002,0.0167,0.0065,0.648,1.2268,3.5861,0.3703,2.174,4.4544,1.6926,9.74,2.7532,4.3568,2.1718,3.1281,4.798,1.6125,2.745,0.604,5.0017,1.6062,3.0688,2.9243,9.2536,4.0288,3.0126,1.4622,3.1189,2.323,6.4834,2.3058,4.9515,0.0442,1.0758,1.2835,3.8767,3.7797,2.2979,1.8275,1.2842,0.1056,2.1854,2.5842,1.0589,2.1302,2.1897,3.3785,5.6201,0.2763,0.5106,2.5789,2.5459,4.7662,5.6558,1.9177,5.1333,0.0064,2.5157,4.7182,1.1148,6.9132,0.0267,0.1422,0.9494,3.4273,2.9393,2.6818,1.0787,9.6913,2.2093,1.2595,3.8904,1.5069,1.2203,6.8738,0.032,5.1794,0.1672,3.2714,0.4122,1.5684,4.7603,6.8856,0.5342,5.5471,3.749,4.4406,1.5988,0.5285,3.2202,1.9766,6.0501,1.8042,7.2174,0.8727,1.3474,3.4582,0.1851,1.2989,1.4764,3.817,2.1585,4.801,3.8046,7.9457,1.1386,3.8986,2.9553,0.3399,4.3637,2.3226,4.798,2.698,4.6224,4.9179,1.6345,1.7965,1.7502,0.3581,1.3157,2.0753,7.265,0.7661,0.8388,1.9879,4.3032,3.8031,0.7814,4.3329,1.0406,2.6654,1.402,2.1763,6.7222,3.09,5.073,0.4346,1.3746,3.5299,5.2513,0.0094,1.6169,2.6401,1.9095,2.3099,0.0559,0.6062,3.4771,1.6036,2.5215,1.591,1.6043,2.5116,7.0629,2.4497,0.6717,0.9636,0.0116,0.1617,0.6816,0.9502,4.3646,0.0175,3.6953,1.2862,1.2616,2.3864,2.7733,1.6617,0.4627,0.2394,3.0366,2.5001,2.0619,1.3631,2.2164,1.1664,3.4374,1.8166,7.6311,4.9466,0.1765,3.662,0.0176,1.9739,1.5076,1.1751,2.4771,1.1902,0.3074,2.9242,3.0003,0.8144,1.2861,2.84,3.6697,0.0778,0.8369,0.0882,1.0655,4.3077,0.0751,1.2646,0.5208,1.4247,4.441,5.1198,2.5592,3.4407,1.637,0.4327,2.4551,1.2102,1.075,2.5955,0.784,1.4477,4.1414,3.5136,1.9924,0.8339,1.624,1.1524,2.6609,0.4176,2.3414,1.9722,0.6796,2.5939,0.7592,2.7917,0.2718,1.6607,2.8708,0.1217,2.4677,2.814,5.5338,1.7594,2.5853,3.8156,1.5454,1.7321,2.8563,2.1099,4.8324,4.7315,0.0628,2.0702,3.0046,3.7425,2.3841,0.5134,2.2798,3.4506,1.0588,0.0884,1.7341,2.8206,0.2846,2.4275]}

All they could accomplish was to make her feel better about me but not about myself, all they were doing was just making her think that they could fix me and take the stress away from her.","token_len":284,"entropy":[9.4216,4.5646,5.8165,3.4978,1.8076,3.9423,0.6821,2.5985,1.6878,2.912,1.3081,7.464,0.8007,1.1697,8.0963,2.8291,5.4428,4.9014,2.5925,3.4492,7.1475,4.0625,1.9748,7.193,1.579,2.0961,5.4105,4.1553,2.6328,1.4501,3.8308,0.8781,1.8521,3.8897,0.6885,4.3713,1.0615,1.4526,3.2849,1.3293,2.0345,6.6097,5.5847,0.0694,6.5405,2.6441,0.4299,1.2761,6.0591,5.2391,0.0615,2.7585,3.7878,5.2388,2.8191,3.658,2.0781,2.1694,3.3441,0.1274,3.2479,2.9273,2.7651,1.0998,7.457,3.094,1.6658,9.0307,4.4755,7.5496,1.5026,6.2682,0.225,5.7858,3.6527,2.4609,2.2151,2.9478,2.2117,2.5282,2.6543,5.1615,0.1821,4.6461,6.8019,0.0286,2.4067,4.1071,1.7715,2.3103,3.9321,7.264,1.9052,2.0189,3.4851,2.9927,4.8586,5.867,3.3822,3.4405,5.6126,0.8598,0.9353,5.2475,0.3298,0.0901,1.1646,0.1166,5.0495,5.6093,0.8274,5.9775,2.7182,1.4089,1.6934,4.2162,3.3965,6.2472,5.18,1.8933,4.628,3.7457,2.4404,2.1223,2.8351,3.7341,4.5766,0.8212,1.7179,1.3521,0.7555,4.1339,0.745,1.8899,5.1167,1.4826,1.9669,0.5396,1.7217,3.3705,1.6205,4.1016,3.0882,2.179,1.3248,5.1143,5.6253,2.3145,4.6537,4.7059,0.9999,4.4707,0.1724,4.7858,0.2021,0.0856,4.0798,0.2898,0.6896,5.9107,1.1254,9.8985,5.2264,1.1714,2.3445,1.4761,1.1646,0.6815,2.9583,3.9209,3.879,4.9355,1.5685,5.8314,1.9496,0.5335,3.0387,1.3026,6.0757,0.3853,3.4448,0.6312,3.6255,5.2056,2.5697,1.4076,0.7117,1.9736,2.4303,5.4805,1.4402,0.4462,2.7353,0.0543,3.2981,0.2789,0.3196,1.6846,4.3311,0.8183,1.7765,4.2274,0.5999,4.539,4.0442,0.8694,3.8076,0.0494,2.7413,2.2714,0.1307,2.3407,3.9359,0.0005,1.1492,0.117,2.0199,3.1046,2.3354,2.622,0.2311,0.4322,3.9298,0.3804,2.6796,5.7797,3.3627,5.0409,1.2597,4.1494,4.9744,1.7692,1.4387,2.242,4.3501,4.931,1.3461,2.1836,1.2181,2.6243,1.8088,4.9762,4.5172,0.525,4.1743,3.0113,2.4929,6.7367,0.2881,1.0973,1.5541,1.223,1.004,2.4297,2.3953,3.5969,5.5047,3.4805,2.1777,2.3635,2.3256,4.7892,2.2283,3.6265,0.7135,0.2064,5.5375,1.2772,0.5,3.5049,1.7333,3.4497,1.8402,4.399,2.402,2.3907,4.6519,3.4208,5.9633,0.6889,0.4867,1.6271,0.5603]}
{"prompt":"Make the saddest love story without involving any deaths , breakups , or separations .","text":"Make the saddest love story without involving any deaths, breakups, or separations. It is not in the heart of any of the characters to get married before finishing one last adventure or one last passionate night with another. It happens as by magic and as if to fulfill a destiny. And the magic and destiny has a happy ending.\nThe director did a great job on establishing the tension during the three days long shooting and the climax of the third day. We get an instant love interest for Shahnaz in Shahnaz Dehlavi and love interest for Mehdi in Mahdieh Shirzad. Shahnaz is playing this role without compromising her persona and Mehdi too is well maintained as a good looking good citizen in the middle of his career but in love with a poor student. They are so perfect that they don\u2019t even have to meet each other on the first day they meet. When the girls meet and see each other, the magic happened and their attraction is so strong that the audience can\u2019t resist to start craving more. Every few scenes are so intense that you end wishing to have them in your own lives. So it\u2019s nice that the director doesn\u2019t go into full blown romance, it just works as long as you look at the right characters. The scenes where the two characters meet at night and do some crazy things are really sweet.","token_len":284,"entropy":[2.9769,10.9506,0.0313,9.173,1.7685,8.0381,8.2115,2.7867,7.4126,2.007,8.3503,4.4885,0.2968,0.9919,7.96,0.0014,0.7699,2.9318,2.1899,2.7799,5.2742,1.1008,4.9262,0.3892,3.4261,1.8921,1.3502,2.0834,2.9117,5.0007,4.0087,5.5256,7.8387,5.2034,5.6884,6.1098,3.0089,4.7015,0.443,10.1486,5.8092,2.5186,3.4964,1.1182,1.5477,5.8342,4.172,8.8839,5.3527,2.4871,3.2436,3.6348,4.9298,6.2276,2.1347,4.1545,1.6408,3.4922,2.8634,4.8587,3.8156,5.3616,5.637,2.5963,4.6318,0.0746,0.6657,1.1522,6.382,9.2435,4.9157,1.8348,1.0295,0.0074,3.4442,5.396,0.8817,3.8384,6.4413,0.5076,5.7913,3.7127,6.192,5.0136,2.9174,2.3045,5.5528,1.5502,0.3217,4.2047,1.5883,1.0154,4.0998,3.6741,3.5927,5.6147,5.0177,5.6111,2.8944,6.1124,8.1376,3.801,4.2238,5.4316,0.6861,0.0557,8.851,6.9512,7.8117,2.5153,6.7491,1.368,0.3782,7.0767,1.064,1.4961,5.4598,9.1098,3.1915,7.537,3.3343,0.5989,0.9084,4.1713,0.0791,0.0107,1.7051,6.5877,5.7155,3.0276,4.7539,7.3548,3.6776,7.9836,2.1317,8.8492,0.0014,6.4363,0.8932,7.7044,7.3611,2.8109,1.0022,4.3756,5.4763,5.9394,8.5454,3.3152,1.3846,4.1472,0.1514,2.8595,2.8883,5.0931,3.4913,6.8846,0.748,2.1735,6.0626,6.6482,1.2709,4.5042,1.6998,4.7477,4.9012,2.2857,1.7058,3.6979,15.9461,7.5056,1.8956,2.4069,1.8001,0.4028,4.1389,0.8386,0.0114,3.9687,1.0312,3.3654,0.2688,4.9872,1.2086,0.6313,4.7533,1.7445,4.7817,3.1124,3.0066,4.984,0.9398,0.0116,1.8625,2.4933,5.7553,8.0808,1.7122,4.0545,6.2492,1.9248,2.7815,1.3751,0.4776,2.3451,4.0526,2.6616,6.9337,0.1931,0.0385,3.1007,4.1957,5.763,7.9956,2.4324,0.8114,6.0965,5.821,2.8723,4.994,2.6398,2.5564,0.8837,2.8462,5.2134,11.2004,3.8916,3.4703,3.6216,3.1287,0.963,4.782,4.2363,0.7437,5.0395,2.956,3.9321,0.3673,0.1182,5.0647,1.6808,1.305,2.4378,4.8043,0.3434,0.1225,0.0492,4.5091,2.4982,5.6707,5.0494,2.4671,3.6118,3.1382,3.103,4.0722,3.1748,4.4105,0.0931,1.9523,6.2657,1.3336,0.9698,6.3954,2.7723,1.189,2.3136,4.4647,2.6309,1.3415,2.2877,2.7699,2.499,3.6814,2.5973,1.8864,5.0529,2.8163,4.1263,1.1216,1.4655,3.2648,4.6679,1.2344]}

You see words floating before you, `` All systems refuelled. Initializing Android Mainframe. '' At first you think those words are meant to be taken literally, but then you begin to hear more words, `` Getting data. Obtaining service '' etc. There is a voice coming from the computer.\nAt first it was a very pleasant voice and the words were said slowly, until you realize you are being controlled by an evil entity. You cannot do anything about it, you are under the control of a computer. Your only way out is to kill him before your hands get too dirty. But it is impossible to know what computer will be in power on the next day. With the ability to switch between systems and data it is much easier to get the better of your human opponents.\nIf you get caught cheating, your punishment varies greatly depending on how often it has happened. If you have done it only once, the computer may give you the benefit of the doubt. However, if the player is caught several times, he will face many years in jail where he will be forced to do some boring and hard labour. Also, there may be new rules put in place, making it even more difficult for a human to catch the player cheating. One of those rules was introduced in the second part.","token_len":286,"entropy":[5.5189,4.1121,4.3052,1.7918,5.5469,0.2275,6.777,1.3345,1.7688,6.619,1.2895,6.09,1.6041,3.4043,0.0401,1.8362,6.2266,0.6533,5.235,1.0386,1.1309,1.8496,4.1101,11.0272,5.1226,7.0445,0.7952,0.7097,13.5692,11.3515,10.8833,10.4484,2.3235,0.3553,2.0083,9.0971,7.1342,13.4479,10.1957,2.6607,1.2178,5.6098,5.1683,2.6659,0.9787,1.8262,6.524,0.872,0.5254,4.7813,0.4062,1.1,4.9786,0.7484,0.6013,0.2783,2.4954,0.6441,4.9142,0.1673,2.8602,3.5878,3.7454,2.0854,3.5424,8.593,7.1309,2.196,8.6262,0.2376,6.7589,8.8879,5.8664,0.3443,4.5024,1.5136,1.3005,7.7247,5.6004,0.6313,1.0937,3.6049,2.2026,3.9485,7.3875,1.1589,3.0433,4.0538,2.3918,3.6894,3.6631,5.3481,3.7133,3.0027,4.0061,1.2696,5.6547,4.3438,1.1066,5.1321,0.7084,3.5709,2.6635,1.6191,3.508,5.5915,0.4582,2.4374,3.8852,1.7719,0.6141,2.1756,4.6215,3.9136,0.2377,1.5007,0.1944,1.0679,2.2234,2.0899,4.3353,1.191,0.5608,0.0234,1.5647,3.1873,0.9773,3.997,2.9379,3.6989,1.468,0.4124,0.2049,3.6342,3.654,4.919,4.468,4.4978,2.327,2.6193,2.0382,0.4762,3.897,3.2132,1.1587,4.2543,0.918,4.5543,1.4588,8.7085,3.7869,2.0789,2.8788,4.802,4.2746,1.2604,1.6631,1.7107,0.7287,5.9923,1.5272,4.8372,0.1158,5.4318,1.6881,3.4555,2.0475,5.2282,3.267,0.6834,4.4737,0.3597,0.4731,2.9833,2.5821,6.5271,0.391,3.5104,6.2499,2.5357,0.2724,1.053,3.992,0.3485,4.1515,3.5471,5.8667,1.2798,3.1058,4.1892,6.9859,2.5653,1.6304,0.05,1.7757,4.2527,4.0755,4.0426,1.153,0.4381,2.1533,0.3403,2.6957,3.9883,2.587,5.5077,0.1899,1.0842,2.6788,3.7808,3.6499,3.8935,0.2209,2.4549,4.2285,0.0328,0.1996,0.0016,0.9744,3.6478,0.3259,0.3426,2.6998,4.6007,2.3429,1.9938,4.8494,0.0272,0.84,2.5548,1.2468,5.0292,4.0016,5.9668,0.6339,1.5176,6.7606,1.0072,0.7815,1.1739,2.5787,0.0363,3.7464,3.4976,7.3312,2.8223,3.8593,4.8925,0.7041,5.5174,0.6758,3.285,3.2739,0.1432,5.5115,3.0347,5.7806,0.22,0.0333,2.8502,5.1394,0.7167,3.3098,1.2479,0.3682,0.8596,3.2269,2.5907,0.4116,4.449,3.3672,2.4548,4.4918,0.3338,5.4775,1.1951,3.2792,1.3362,3.2715,3.527,1.3196,1.4157,4.9118,3.9575,4.3874]}

As you read the book, the Bible becomes a window you can look at into eternity, and you can see how Jesus Christ came to earth to save all humanity.\nI have a few books about the Bible. My first book is The Bible: An Explanation, which tells you how the Bible is a collection of ancient history. This is how the Bible, the holy Scriptures, came to be.\nBut my other book, The New Testament: An Explanation, tells you how the Bible isn\u2019t history. The Bible tells you a great deal about the human heart and the power of Jesus Christ.\nGod sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to the earth in a human body. And he came to do good, and to love, and to give his life for us. The Bible says that Jesus Christ is eternal life.\nThe Bible tells you how Jesus became alive again on that third day, after he was crucified. He was raised from the dead, because he died and then was raised from the dead. He came back to save us.

The boogeyman appears in his bedroom at night, and the child asks him to `` scare the bad kids away ''. In the dark corner it often looks like something, but in the final analysis no one can be convinced. After a while, the child begins to show a reaction to the situation: His eyes wander, his chest gets tight, he clench his fist. In the worst cases he begins to stutter, his legs stiffen, the pupils dilate. But even if this happens, nothing changes. The only solution to all this is to flee. It is necessary to leave the house, and as soon as possible. Only then does the child realize that he can not escape. You become an object of a game that you do not understand.\nAt the age of 5-6 children have no idea how to protect themselves. Parents can help you by explaining the reason why things are not good from the perspective of the child. And to start thinking that even those who are very, very bad, and they make fun and tease everyone. Therefore, you must be especially careful yourself, to not allow himself be seen by him, to not be seen by his friends, which will help to protect himself. It can help to tell the child, for example, that if something happens, and you hear a voice, you have to stop, no matter what the situation.","token_len":287,"entropy":[8.7377,2.6354,7.1992,6.8951,3.1,0.2081,1.4951,2.9822,10.9823,0.497,0.1596,5.8482,2.0997,4.2665,4.9816,2.9624,1.505,1.3364,1.8906,2.6189,3.7697,5.8728,1.969,1.1788,13.8378,15.9432,1.0397,5.9711,3.5182,4.4624,4.7187,6.3394,5.0538,1.4554,5.5946,4.7772,6.8412,6.1209,3.6116,0.2079,4.6813,6.3137,1.2041,2.792,2.12,7.5503,1.781,6.2135,0.6646,2.5482,4.5672,4.7491,1.0624,5.887,2.1637,1.486,1.3562,1.2639,1.8848,3.4445,0.1986,4.7517,2.7844,6.4472,1.1771,0.7776,5.3318,4.0119,5.7041,2.0766,6.5164,1.4888,1.371,4.8801,5.1231,3.6807,0.4299,1.8306,6.6857,4.0787,0.4621,2.1516,1.9735,3.5719,0.8744,5.102,3.2472,2.2109,5.1137,0.4744,7.9746,0.2347,1.0894,1.8361,4.0083,6.041,0.1924,0.5318,4.1044,3.771,1.2093,0.1341,1.7587,4.4421,3.758,2.3502,2.6693,2.412,0.8064,4.6386,4.0868,0.4422,1.7787,4.2731,5.4042,2.6279,4.3052,0.6745,0.3343,0.6157,6.9632,1.2167,3.4426,0.9203,5.9063,0.3741,3.3568,1.0853,2.1361,1.917,1.7999,5.1792,0.9904,0.0046,1.5382,3.8677,5.9148,1.302,4.0863,0.8796,1.1411,2.6551,0.654,0.9157,2.9188,2.8808,1.5122,1.0168,6.0927,6.9916,3.2677,2.9118,0.364,4.9237,6.5185,3.43,3.0283,4.2657,0.0147,2.7901,0.6158,3.0016,7.3256,1.5444,3.4767,0.019,3.8573,3.168,0.2904,6.0319,3.4535,3.606,1.0754,1.9897,0.1812,5.7883,0.0746,1.0461,4.7604,3.968,3.7289,4.0927,1.7293,4.8275,2.0956,5.0319,1.1464,5.6608,1.3963,3.0248,4.9429,6.5659,0.9211,3.1693,0.0425,1.3631,0.6337,0.6679,4.8178,4.7691,5.6746,4.8352,4.1971,5.6875,5.9333,1.1964,1.4847,4.0125,6.0941,0.0079,3.4711,2.956,3.5089,4.6592,5.4251,3.9512,6.0244,6.3989,5.6138,3.9206,6.3796,0.7211,2.1821,1.8491,2.6639,6.1097,0.7187,8.5221,1.9017,2.9931,1.8408,3.5217,8.383,6.9627,3.9534,2.9349,7.936,2.0835,2.0016,1.631,2.5681,1.2766,0.9178,2.806,1.652,0.8782,6.1347,2.8992,4.3831,2.366,3.3645,4.4575,0.9395,3.5337,4.2232,2.7715,0.8652,4.2796,2.017,0.9814,2.9895,4.6062,0.4905,0.23,0.5886,2.8282,4.524,1.6229,1.483,3.9897,1.9945,5.7708,2.4785,2.7167,1.9542,2.1417,3.23,0.9617,3.3384,2.6316,6.1987,0.0706,0.6189,2.6882,2.3115,0.9649]}

Fire Witch + Sand Wizard= Glass magic [ WP ]\nThe Magic of Sorcerers is a very strong but very limited form of Magic and therefore cannot create any form of true magic. This type of Magic is very powerful but very restricted to its use and is therefore not considered to be very versatile. The Sorcerer is able to call the spirits of the dead by the chanting of appropriate words and spells. Although the power of such magic is limited the Sorcerer can often make up a new spell based on what he has already been able to create or have taught to some of his former servants or apprentices or to any other magical adepts who are willing to assist. Magic as taught by the Sorcerer is purely the power in his own self, but is very limited in its effects, and does not create any direct effect but rather creates an effect within the imagination of the person casting the spell, this can create a physical pain depending on how powerful and how long the effect caused by the spell. The power of the Sorcerer or other magical adepts can also greatly increase, and at times even reverse, the power of other types of magic.\nA Sorcerer or any magician, or indeed anyone who is sufficiently high in the ladder of the spellmaking and enchanting magic, can create powerful magic, but the success rate of this type of spell is rarely greater than 50%.","token_len":288,"entropy":[4.4256,10.6534,5.5858,1.857,3.1905,2.659,8.7855,2.2671,5.9369,6.6762,4.015,6.863,0.3333,1.3892,5.3455,3.009,9.5236,8.1921,7.8021,11.0392,7.0215,7.583,10.0544,7.9528,6.7307,13.9342,0.6867,1.759,7.2463,5.3171,1.6051,8.6342,0.0311,1.2942,1.9163,4.152,3.5761,5.4638,2.6422,2.6336,2.5141,0.0484,2.5744,4.2368,4.8294,4.1366,7.4171,2.8719,4.2638,0.1827,4.5104,0.5871,0.6658,2.9953,5.0318,0.1424,0.7792,0.9616,3.1783,1.7024,2.3418,3.3946,5.1153,2.8678,4.5055,3.0661,3.2292,2.3835,3.5845,1.749,2.5468,1.6527,0.1295,4.3731,5.6781,0.5076,2.2482,4.6543,2.0856,2.8653,0.0283,7.1833,3.8983,4.837,0.5498,1.9686,0.9637,5.0044,2.6505,9.219,0.4008,8.9903,3.6539,1.6447,2.8536,1.0683,5.8923,1.691,4.2374,0.5669,3.9631,1.4484,0.5086,1.5792,4.5066,2.1598,1.1572,5.384,3.6912,5.0089,3.0776,4.8168,2.8396,5.0097,0.1941,3.4542,1.1657,1.2651,3.0071,4.6627,1.9458,0.007,2.9789,3.5111,4.657,5.7768,2.6549,5.613,2.1099,0.7818,5.0056,3.962,3.0502,3.8666,4.1457,3.3973,3.7265,1.1026,4.0779,5.6491,1.7251,2.8951,2.0912,2.5639,0.1133,3.4908,2.4592,4.8994,5.6295,5.7371,0.9712,0.7069,0.8241,0.7367,7.7081,3.9754,3.4736,6.0186,1.6519,3.1137,5.9841,1.8843,2.9817,2.7252,4.0033,1.6458,1.6972,1.3326,3.4884,2.7867,1.5118,3.4199,0.064,4.9514,0.9452,5.3588,2.3869,5.1074,1.9513,2.5318,2.8931,1.7987,4.9609,0.9421,5.9638,0.3617,0.7613,3.7048,4.6873,0.9038,0.1648,2.3318,6.3155,2.7333,4.6875,1.6697,5.8074,6.6468,7.3058,0.1816,2.3855,3.8329,3.4336,3.1029,3.4578,0.8254,3.6929,10.8301,2.4203,0.2918,0.3548,4.2569,1.6693,3.518,0.3069,1.5479,0.8811,6.0265,3.295,1.8309,1.6913,0.2964,2.3408,2.3868,5.2233,2.098,4.4989,2.5102,5.3609,1.5652,2.1083,5.4671,0.9757,0.609,1.7204,0.1644,3.6665,5.1475,0.0191,0.4402,1.028,1.9228,4.3689,1.7834,4.0783,2.9066,5.3444,3.5269,2.8078,5.9767,2.7987,0.8312,1.6005,6.8062,5.4119,1.1554,1.5065,10.8095,0.456,2.6154,5.2115,4.6345,3.9027,8.9125,0.0483,4.7979,1.4333,0.8587,1.6994,5.258,2.2302,2.5681,1.3636,2.8175,7.8545,2.1282,0.5814,2.5112,2.4302,0.197,3.6601,0.8545,4.9021,2.9476,0.0489,4.3507,0.9811]}

Many of us who are trying to get away from a system that does not serve us and to create one we can be proud of, are also trying to live by the rules of nature and not those of corporate systems. And we know that by doing that we are following God's own rules and by doing so we could live on a sustainable planet.

But the day you were abducted kicked off a chain of events that led to WWIII. Questions swirl in your head. Why you? And do you have the key to end the war?.\nAs with the whole series, the story isn't complicated, it is pretty linear. There are no twists or puzzles, nor is it very detailed. In fact, the information is so simple as to be frustrating. A lot happens in between scenes, the pace isn't quick. But this isn't bad, in fact, it feels as if we're being slowly led from one event to another in the storyline. The characters are all pretty well developed with varying motivations, and it's a delight to see them in action. The cast is well fleshed out, with interesting conversations and interactions taking place.\nOne thing I wasn't really expecting, but that was pretty impressive was how complex and varied the graphics were. It's not uncommon to see modern graphics done with 3D modelling, but when you see this done so well... there was a reason to be impressed. Some of the explosions looked really intense with some 3D, shadowy effects and a huge amount of detail. I just love the way the backgrounds were done. It was all so well done. I was blown away and it was a very impressive use of the engine.","token_len":288,"entropy":[6.6895,0.0319,5.2936,1.2941,0.1713,2.5536,1.3282,2.8516,5.5833,1.4663,8.7449,9.4464,4.615,4.6537,4.0239,0.0081,2.1664,0.8186,3.2427,3.3475,5.1297,1.8392,4.9321,6.3904,11.99,0.4829,2.6767,6.5484,0.3932,0.2009,0.6273,3.4428,0.2894,11.1609,3.6433,0.9128,10.5264,6.5982,3.4114,0.3645,0.6692,2.1705,3.7125,5.221,6.2653,3.2067,4.636,0.1385,2.2826,3.1349,6.966,0.2594,7.789,1.2853,0.7352,0.4664,8.0567,1.0432,9.0695,4.6374,2.4366,4.5764,4.6416,0.3091,2.2069,3.1752,4.2917,0.0009,6.0308,1.8436,2.5704,3.9463,5.4339,6.382,0.4697,2.7154,0.5915,2.3183,5.4771,1.1995,5.9173,1.8421,4.6109,1.8068,2.0593,4.0691,3.7508,0.5949,3.9213,0.3999,0.1277,1.7485,6.8098,1.4726,2.0287,3.7349,5.3929,0.045,0.8322,6.9556,1.2601,4.8763,1.906,5.4711,1.0477,4.6285,3.8304,1.06,4.6135,6.4295,4.9437,0.0004,3.6967,2.9285,3.3679,4.0509,2.1075,0.0005,4.9455,1.6641,5.0354,0.5113,1.1088,0.7264,4.73,4.2531,0.4992,3.3567,0.9925,3.9406,6.5984,4.6326,4.3089,0.9041,3.8938,0.1316,0.9374,3.3473,1.8517,6.0487,0.3836,2.354,3.1245,1.0211,3.055,4.2177,1.8683,1.2458,4.5723,5.3307,4.9845,1.1398,1.9749,3.054,0.6335,2.7327,5.4387,0.2316,1.1656,1.0198,3.7934,0.9865,0.4419,2.2397,5.2322,0.8669,2.5947,9.128,0.0001,0.0,0.0531,0.7918,2.4011,5.2196,6.0924,1.3287,4.4545,5.4972,0.0329,1.1533,2.2734,3.7831,1.4781,1.3856,5.7233,0.0006,3.4248,2.0976,2.0104,2.5275,2.6164,2.6068,5.0952,4.7436,6.1369,1.4605,6.5568,1.8027,3.7531,0.4239,8.7369,1.197,0.255,2.8042,0.8694,2.2626,4.2707,1.0137,0.4533,7.0268,1.53,5.1393,2.1998,4.4574,0.0653,6.3286,0.9052,0.9606,4.221,1.0761,2.8267,3.129,5.7911,5.8711,1.1003,7.5099,4.023,3.6573,1.8134,4.8202,3.0716,2.1633,3.1586,0.4719,5.6724,0.8792,0.2594,7.221,4.3345,3.1276,4.6801,4.1714,3.1715,6.3294,0.0482,5.3575,13.9166,4.7264,3.1357,2.7445,4.626,1.3425,0.0102,2.5093,1.4007,2.6089,4.9223,3.7268,1.2362,2.2877,1.0568,3.9364,2.3683,3.0806,1.2101,2.6207,1.9435,4.2181,3.4204,2.1423,0.2346,1.2494,2.6707,2.9136,4.177,0.0008,3.9759,3.6066,1.2322,2.2463,3.4813,3.466,6.376,0.0134,2.3283,4.9091,0.4021]}

In the afterlife you awkwardly must introduce your current spouse to your deceased one. That seems awfully strange, and you suspect that this is not as real as you expect it to be. Can you prove that you are right and prove what was real in reality?\nA: That is the correct answer. In the afterlife you awkwardly must introduce your current spouse to your deceased one.\nA man and his wife are married. They have two children. Years later, the husband dies. He then marries again and has a child. A year later, his second wife dies, too. In the afterlife, he wants to meet both his first and second wife. What language would the spirits of his first and second wife be able to understand? What kind of things would they be able to say to each other?\nA: It is a misconception people have of the Afterlife. It has not got anything remotely to do with a life after death. The Afterlife in fact has to do with the process of our death.\nThis man is dead. His physical body has not died; it has moved on to the next realm or plane of existence. In the past he had lived on Earth in this physical body as a human. It is now in the next higher plane of existence known as the Realm of Spirit.","token_len":289,"entropy":[5.6998,8.4173,6.2839,2.7359,8.5616,2.7789,3.1068,8.7452,0.0643,0.0018,0.9764,0.7907,2.8921,1.0214,5.4726,0.2288,2.8822,0.2505,1.7725,0.0419,5.1131,4.2731,3.7144,0.5566,3.8917,2.0405,4.4964,2.069,13.6613,8.618,8.5382,1.4693,5.6393,1.0138,1.3751,1.4911,3.0783,5.3282,1.4348,4.7451,6.0413,5.6399,3.8804,1.1694,2.2463,2.4683,6.3235,1.0413,2.8212,1.1656,3.6059,5.241,5.8135,0.3454,0.9131,5.9339,1.5315,0.0239,0.0391,0.3106,6.1106,0.4615,4.4965,1.4616,2.3106,1.9791,4.4947,3.3417,6.4646,4.7527,4.3316,6.0557,2.7003,5.4238,0.2648,1.3964,6.9115,1.7394,4.7892,1.4934,2.8511,6.39,1.1531,0.6338,2.7135,1.461,0.8619,1.3111,5.0212,1.6663,0.0511,0.0822,0.22,0.2815,0.0128,0.0796,0.0678,0.0745,0.1084,3.2153,2.3184,6.1527,3.3175,2.2284,0.3738,1.9589,2.8016,1.9035,2.5791,2.1912,1.8945,0.3097,1.1192,8.9327,0.887,1.0125,2.0588,2.576,1.8772,1.3822,2.0842,4.1358,4.7238,0.0,3.1238,2.0387,2.9494,1.5893,1.7667,0.8992,4.1485,2.2661,0.2318,0.2883,2.4917,3.6115,0.1797,1.8788,2.1031,3.5437,0.2087,3.2104,0.4997,0.1127,1.1919,1.6037,6.8578,0.3126,4.9252,6.0495,2.7629,1.9491,1.1171,0.1291,1.7984,1.3463,4.6351,10.3804,2.4014,4.2738,9.1893,1.8698,1.8206,1.5121,1.446,0.0538,2.0577,2.9988,2.6684,0.0018,2.2403,0.611,3.0164,2.8136,0.0069,5.7248,0.6171,1.2366,2.4788,0.196,0.0054,1.8331,1.3588,1.1117,0.0841,0.6606,1.2574,0.8379,0.1101,3.1275,1.0385,2.7866,7.1855,7.6462,1.4043,3.5909,1.1367,11.7023,0.1997,0.6718,2.1539,4.0134,3.5541,7.386,3.9485,7.8608,3.3381,0.0089,0.0005,4.5042,3.5931,3.6488,0.0681,0.3847,2.2949,2.8045,0.0047,5.7302,1.7244,1.5249,5.4075,0.073,0.0287,1.3612,5.4907,0.1656,5.2756,3.4674,0.6,2.0459,4.9248,6.7695,2.2137,2.8477,0.759,2.8501,6.7487,0.5551,1.785,2.6024,2.9874,4.9035,1.2569,1.0001,5.4495,0.6141,1.393,1.3484,1.8958,6.8778,5.0535,4.7967,0.5017,0.1362,0.2864,3.285,0.8423,7.9176,1.9363,1.6594,2.3653,2.5654,2.7508,3.358,4.4913,5.8733,0.5865,4.6511,0.9708,2.5286,1.4036,3.4082,1.0714,3.8461,2.6766,1.2351,4.3558,7.3717,0.4038,1.1652,0.0798,7.1793,0.0198,0.5241,5.1836,0.0936,5.5338,0.6159]}

The promise of a \u201csuper fast\u201d wireless connection and the ability to provide high-performance service applications that require a wireless backbone, have led to the rapid growth of WiMAX worldwide.\nWiMAX is the acronym for the Global System for Mobile Communications - Radio Access Network Worldwide-Interoperability for Microwave Access network. The WiMAX network will be a national infrastructure supporting a variety of applications, including broadband wireless data, videoconferencing between offices and home, and voice over long-haul wireless links. The WiMAX network will combine the best elements of existing wireless systems, including satellite, terrestrial, and wireless LAN (WLANs) systems.

{"prompt":"Grimm fairytale-esque story that uses the phrase 'tickle tickle ' at least once .","text":"Grimm fairytale-esque story that uses the phrase 'tickle tickle'at least once. A child and a goat play as it tickles them, with a bird's-eye view. The game features a classic music theme as well as a few catchy tunes including 'What The Bizz' from the 'Grrrls' movie. The gameplay is very simple - as you play the game you move the goat through a series of levels which feature moving platforms whilst dodging obstacles along the way. There are three characters to play - a young boy wearing a green top, a tall girl wearing a pink top and a tall boy with big hair wearing a green top. The goats can run and jump and even climb up some obstacles. You get more points each time a platform is completed - which is when a number plate and an icon appears at the top. You get a bigger goat with more points each time you complete a platform.\nThe game is divided into three stages each with 20 levels - the first stage is called 'Baby Goat Go to School', the second stage is called 'Goat Goes To Work' and the third is called 'Goat Has Another Surprise '. This particular 'Grrls' game is the full version and there are also versions of the game available as single player games. They are all played in exactly the same way - as above, except they only include stage one or stage two.","token_len":289,"entropy":[9.2445,2.0935,12.3623,2.2878,0.1199,4.2487,5.25,3.2656,3.031,5.3532,1.6465,5.5006,2.5984,5.0704,6.8188,7.7672,0.5183,0.4228,13.6601,2.5242,1.9399,1.5218,4.6549,5.5583,4.3699,2.0107,5.4661,4.7145,4.1386,5.1381,5.5647,0.0302,3.5954,1.5867,3.7304,2.1987,7.0712,2.5378,3.3904,0.0469,0.0236,2.3249,1.8869,4.084,5.1026,1.4425,6.2856,6.3425,3.3891,3.8165,1.0056,0.2851,1.3212,3.9047,5.5133,1.9041,4.2948,1.4966,5.5532,4.6544,5.0881,7.8509,8.5629,2.5717,1.6973,3.6049,6.6474,4.0103,3.2335,0.5596,4.0587,0.8122,1.8903,4.9934,0.8052,2.5506,1.5152,3.7097,5.3687,1.5227,2.4981,1.9682,0.3769,0.8498,4.4811,2.2144,5.6739,3.1381,1.3562,1.4115,0.0018,3.6966,3.3343,5.0671,6.6228,3.4051,7.7574,5.2659,3.2731,4.6495,0.2045,0.039,0.1929,3.0161,0.5504,2.7595,6.0974,2.1702,2.3946,3.0683,1.7969,3.5127,1.9813,6.8132,0.5255,4.1694,4.662,1.7943,0.2739,4.2704,2.0163,1.5765,0.3487,2.8841,0.7404,0.6294,0.2341,3.4072,0.4733,1.0813,6.0813,3.7734,3.8434,0.2922,2.784,0.3592,0.3628,1.2459,3.9405,3.1143,4.7999,2.0736,0.5015,1.9794,5.0937,2.8409,3.1138,5.0291,2.7615,0.8407,3.5711,4.9261,4.8503,2.6584,3.1505,0.6274,4.4108,5.1061,0.4697,3.8437,3.3899,3.3848,1.2502,5.6547,3.3068,5.0854,9.085,4.6867,3.6779,3.998,3.695,3.7095,0.1706,0.8503,1.8432,2.8487,3.3904,1.8644,5.8947,7.2461,2.9735,2.1994,1.8618,2.8347,0.0539,1.3791,1.6258,1.2707,2.0346,0.6696,2.766,5.3038,1.2235,1.4418,4.0439,0.0816,1.7554,2.0995,4.8709,1.0981,5.7479,0.8577,3.4154,2.9177,0.9629,1.7949,1.4022,4.6701,0.7854,7.4303,1.7546,6.9034,7.2745,3.9356,1.7402,0.5178,0.1382,0.2804,0.5117,0.2838,0.0392,4.0621,2.73,5.8569,2.2578,5.0299,1.1076,0.0273,0.0497,0.2299,2.6994,0.1637,0.0459,0.9223,0.0483,5.1023,5.437,5.4452,6.3947,3.8992,6.729,6.0703,7.7856,3.9701,0.0832,0.3042,1.2128,1.0999,3.3541,7.1472,0.8382,2.4165,4.1097,0.539,2.6974,5.8609,1.0136,1.0319,1.6381,2.4015,3.114,6.8742,1.5965,3.86,0.889,5.5616,0.938,2.766,3.8303,1.4985,7.2778,0.0405,0.0106,0.2029,1.8282,3.3582,7.2896,2.3579,3.0834,4.0214,4.3874,3.9435,6.4484,3.4932,5.8207,2.509,0.1771,0.5871]}

Then there was little change. The first volume had The Little Prince starring in the book and the second, a story that was a little different every time. I could always put the books on my shelf and it would be simple that way. So now I am buying the Little Prince Collection Volume 1. It doesn t bring a tear to my eye and I don t need to read it, but I own it. The next book is The Little Prince in the Forest and the last is The Little Prince and the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.

The other evil ones have to do evil but not too evil, otherwise no one would like them, so they have to be cunning.\nTeenage rebellion is a combination of fear of authority and a fear of becoming a part of the normal teenagers.\nOne has to have a lot of courage to rebel. Not many have that or they end up being like Zuko. And they can't blame him. It sounds like Zuko came into this world too early or too late or just a little different.\nTeenagers have these kinds of problems when growing up, especially when it's about their first girlfriend. Usually they get very protective over the new boy or girl and they make up little stories about them to try to make themselves feel happy.\nI really enjoyed reading this article but I was very disappointed with one thing. It all talked about teenage girls and how they are rebelling because they feel their feelings getting ignored and they don't understand why. This is just so false, and I have been to high school and I was just like they were talking about. Teenage males and teenage females are just different, and there is no reason to make it seem like a rebellion is happening only between teenage male characters because some are just different and we shouldn't try put a label on them because all males and females are different!","token_len":291,"entropy":[7.6926,9.0572,5.4168,4.3856,10.3078,3.2621,5.3945,5.3374,5.775,1.8505,2.4043,2.8594,3.9262,1.194,6.2929,7.9634,4.2605,0.703,9.4381,1.2544,5.7424,1.4541,0.8543,3.0804,5.5358,5.1011,5.5699,3.6615,2.3267,2.1108,4.0679,5.3358,1.2943,0.7616,1.2787,1.4983,5.7258,5.3624,0.9861,1.3576,4.9263,1.1928,2.3204,2.5287,1.5323,2.9234,0.1815,1.6636,8.6735,1.8485,2.3749,9.6863,0.0278,0.7618,1.868,3.8664,6.1538,0.0677,5.6743,1.8178,5.6347,0.8764,3.1484,3.0376,0.0822,4.9735,2.0816,5.0436,0.0062,1.3787,7.0282,8.7518,1.0083,2.286,5.4932,5.431,0.2429,3.6326,1.563,2.5464,0.0991,2.8537,0.8113,3.9677,1.8717,5.5368,3.7265,3.2913,3.0775,6.8111,3.715,5.9078,0.0081,2.3442,5.2591,7.8591,4.428,1.5256,4.3017,2.9609,3.1012,1.1935,7.5044,3.5051,1.4999,3.3704,6.8565,1.2706,3.8436,0.0029,6.1367,3.1364,2.8176,1.2276,4.8968,2.9366,4.0258,1.1082,0.5738,3.1557,3.8047,3.6312,2.1464,7.0491,0.9665,1.431,2.1007,6.2669,2.3789,6.3341,4.958,0.0017,3.0705,3.4479,7.0076,0.0107,1.7898,3.193,1.5984,1.986,2.0647,4.0547,3.1607,5.8351,8.6459,1.0243,5.9349,1.4991,3.5058,4.3194,4.9362,5.3656,2.9471,5.522,4.7246,2.4321,0.737,2.0045,2.2613,5.3212,3.3319,6.2363,1.9654,0.785,2.1616,3.4446,2.9811,1.0815,2.3301,2.9845,1.8647,4.4299,1.0444,1.3487,3.3641,4.7496,3.6129,3.6118,1.6693,5.5376,4.4916,0.8312,3.1718,4.0645,1.5432,1.8148,5.4927,3.8712,1.0105,2.3928,6.285,8.1313,0.1574,6.3572,2.7391,2.6156,1.4414,1.288,2.4858,9.8797,0.0645,4.0846,0.7474,3.3399,3.9873,4.9162,7.8001,4.588,2.4822,2.3803,1.6895,0.0005,3.2099,1.4347,1.285,3.7069,1.1861,3.8644,3.8158,5.9948,2.2173,2.371,1.6837,4.0695,3.4791,4.2741,5.5271,0.2404,1.0418,2.4074,3.2471,3.9022,2.4715,6.0444,2.5622,5.3215,0.1577,7.1287,5.5936,0.6958,6.1093,2.8302,1.8401,0.2039,1.306,3.1819,3.057,2.2465,1.3897,3.3706,1.1751,1.1049,3.6024,1.3162,4.1049,3.4659,4.0297,0.4515,3.6441,5.2638,2.1813,1.7772,6.6142,3.7554,3.4879,4.4794,5.8484,4.6239,5.2338,3.3804,2.5872,3.0389,2.2018,5.0613,4.8635,0.0004,3.8071,10.4948,2.8894,2.8207,0.1345,0.9528,2.6853,5.5199,5.4386,1.8445,0.9822,0.4775,0.4824,5.5799]}

A team of scientists go back in time to learn about human origins and evolution, only what they discover is far, far more interesting. In what seems a future world, but with all the modern conveniences you could ever imagine. So this team of scientists decides to stay in what seems like the 21st Century. But to actually discover the truth.\nThe premise of this book is really good. It is not easy to keep the focus on this book even though you are reading an awesome book. There are also a lot of side issues that come up, and you may wish there was more detail and maybe a bit more explanation to those. But the characters in this book are really interesting. Also it has a really good mystery part to it. I was really fascinated by the characters in this book. Some of them are really good and some are not.\nThe book also has a very interesting theme of the future which is not that futuristic, but it gives you an idea of what we are headed your in the future. I do think there needs to be more depth to all the characters and the story. Also there needs to be a good ending to the book.\nI think this book is really good. It has a good mystery that keeps you interested, and you are not going to stop reading until you know what the answer is. I think this is a really good book that people can enjoy.","token_len":293,"entropy":[10.1823,2.1921,9.7099,2.4707,6.5775,5.998,2.7833,5.5714,1.6508,4.4222,6.583,0.3938,1.7296,6.0632,3.2086,0.6581,0.0135,0.7699,4.7996,1.4031,6.0081,2.847,1.2611,4.0184,1.5718,6.3461,9.165,1.186,4.2435,1.7573,4.8545,4.5283,0.017,1.5167,1.8353,1.6057,3.6669,6.246,3.7473,3.8334,6.4843,2.9881,0.5239,7.0485,2.4446,4.2136,0.6566,6.3643,2.8852,0.0029,5.5517,2.8321,1.7785,0.8149,3.1688,5.3624,4.4858,5.2478,1.1294,0.6022,5.6427,0.2495,5.9581,1.4772,6.9417,2.733,0.9522,1.8225,5.9045,0.0026,3.0128,1.7433,3.4126,4.4359,6.099,5.188,1.6168,2.478,2.9496,1.6609,7.2394,6.0656,0.7934,1.1385,2.5859,0.2148,5.6267,4.8002,0.8893,1.5887,1.8296,2.8347,5.1302,0.6365,5.1879,3.7028,4.8885,0.4427,4.407,2.0419,5.6226,1.4262,2.1284,1.687,2.7709,5.2386,4.9924,0.7792,0.837,3.4764,0.4783,4.8809,2.1427,0.8286,0.0351,5.914,4.7346,1.5734,2.9593,0.1902,2.2022,2.1455,3.3741,3.3993,5.1461,4.2068,0.8041,0.6933,4.2054,2.7489,5.3462,1.4935,2.3236,0.2485,4.6032,3.7017,4.6508,1.8452,1.5876,2.2254,5.3376,3.6334,0.3965,0.1364,0.6218,2.7152,2.0046,1.05,6.0902,3.9959,3.1174,1.0189,3.4801,1.4421,6.2534,7.3263,2.5614,0.1402,0.5846,2.5076,3.6749,1.8672,5.344,0.5717,1.1209,3.4419,2.5761,0.4367,0.09,0.8588,4.6968,0.4899,0.5979,1.1333,2.1333,2.4465,1.5075,0.5408,1.043,1.6699,0.7119,2.56,1.7516,2.6277,3.4462,0.6276,0.744,2.8856,2.1805,4.223,2.8159,2.3533,3.0916,4.6287,0.9894,3.2956,4.3114,5.1524,1.8118,0.5551,3.1817,5.3399,1.5605,2.1546,0.3255,0.3133,0.9836,3.3214,1.1635,3.3237,11.4382,5.7827,1.1747,0.3802,0.3423,2.6789,4.5271,1.6951,2.535,4.729,0.0249,0.0159,1.4486,5.1335,1.7429,5.2739,1.3571,1.2626,1.9359,1.9028,2.3347,1.1022,3.9107,2.2379,4.293,0.0053,0.0264,1.2776,3.5188,4.6359,1.9433,0.821,0.6517,0.6895,1.7359,2.2541,2.6098,1.8955,0.4409,0.7564,2.0926,1.0179,1.2525,1.3832,1.7613,0.9869,1.6622,2.5877,5.0577,4.8727,0.6518,1.4808,2.8232,1.1278,3.618,2.9123,1.7776,2.5692,0.0709,3.7822,0.3681,2.4533,0.3564,3.2004,1.2442,2.029,4.7408,0.2179,0.2188,1.904,1.6431,1.9796,1.5376,1.2973,2.2081,0.4865,0.4111,2.6329,3.7907,2.5974,1.8619,0.8092]}

The owner of the mind you're trying to access is none other than Mr. Mind!\nI don't think you'll like the gameplay in this game. Some of the puzzles are so easy you can play them by heart within minutes. But there are a few puzzles you play as normal and a few \" secret \" puzzles you only have access to by playing the game in different ways. I find that I always use the first method, as I think it's the easiest. However, this is a game with a high replay value ; after playing this game a few times, you'll realize you actually solve 90% of the puzzles you initially thought were impossible. The puzzles that are frustrating will keep you engaged, and you won't give up till you figure it out ( which is part of the whole point of the game ).\nThe puzzles that aren't impossible but take long times to solve tend to be the puzzles that are the most rewarding. This is because you know that the game is on your side. Playing as the master and forcing you into a position you felt you could not make progress on will really test your abilities.","token_len":294,"entropy":[3.7506,3.3197,3.5103,0.3801,7.28,6.8638,2.0021,0.192,4.7014,1.6672,2.9334,1.3623,3.3245,8.0403,2.4999,2.2387,9.3757,6.5846,0.2172,14.0385,0.0649,2.0748,6.8934,0.629,1.3007,3.0301,3.9908,4.7818,2.7584,0.3338,2.9315,2.7012,9.6296,9.3483,7.5596,1.729,8.5283,0.6789,0.0545,1.7023,1.683,5.8178,4.7019,2.207,6.5008,2.2359,3.8997,0.5447,0.796,6.5344,6.4189,9.6899,3.8706,0.6446,3.8494,6.1697,0.8739,4.3485,0.0029,0.6738,2.196,6.2324,4.4271,3.0701,0.0026,1.9864,2.854,3.9081,1.1071,0.9608,4.0962,2.8083,3.5645,1.7438,0.0021,1.5915,1.1143,4.9382,0.0028,0.0156,5.2052,0.1134,7.6052,4.5313,1.5194,9.1965,3.7577,0.0014,2.1205,1.7727,1.9071,3.2502,1.9267,5.1495,3.6553,0.7715,0.3866,0.8843,5.3329,1.4678,0.5033,1.1161,1.0748,3.506,3.0722,2.2694,1.9888,3.6847,1.3706,4.3407,5.8821,7.8803,1.2163,0.829,2.6926,2.9029,0.7996,2.2154,0.6465,2.6767,2.5929,7.6619,4.3108,6.4791,2.7435,4.2395,0.5938,6.2683,12.9328,1.2028,0.5619,1.6788,4.4432,2.3385,3.0395,0.027,3.3341,3.2183,1.7438,0.5758,3.8049,6.1632,1.5925,0.2099,2.4865,4.142,2.0654,3.1711,4.4597,5.1441,1.0737,4.0723,4.6629,2.0102,4.4843,1.4605,3.4916,1.1325,0.8468,1.7498,2.1886,2.3036,3.3921,0.0301,3.3638,1.7123,1.8281,0.8024,2.7706,1.196,4.4185,4.2601,0.5158,11.344,7.6349,2.6892,3.0086,0.4395,3.6589,1.0167,0.0788,0.641,2.1689,0.8985,1.8991,2.7032,4.7493,7.7145,8.7683,0.3594,0.0298,0.4465,0.153,2.9225,6.7677,1.9728,2.7808,1.1593,0.3814,2.6204,2.318,3.0607,1.7142,6.643,4.8024,5.0451,0.5951,6.1744,2.6066,1.9855,1.7422,2.9092,0.0011,5.031,0.0845,7.5979,0.401,5.0447,2.6165,0.0603,4.9392,8.8222,0.8808,5.7209,0.0233,0.4236,6.6532,1.7986,0.2955,1.6857,0.1865,1.8248,1.4401,2.2198,2.3247,2.2029,4.2483,0.0004,5.7432,3.9587,6.1053,4.9095,6.0099,0.3448,0.5081,5.4377,0.0151,0.6617,2.4438,5.0622,0.5795,1.5677,2.7417,1.1273,3.5282,0.6955,3.3131,0.8776,1.7012,1.9077,4.1863,1.8757,2.167,2.1152,1.3029,5.1221,1.9642,1.739,1.6975,6.8342,3.4034,2.4246,3.9568,3.6002,6.5202,3.8795,4.4197,1.9524,5.1044,3.1605,6.7663,1.3688,1.9294,1.8954,5.4341,4.9243,2.2823,2.3163,6.2133,5.371,0.2748,2.663,0.952]}

I can\u2019t say we understood it all but I feel so blessed to be able to experience part of it through you.\nThis is one such story I can relate to. When we first met, we were just kids (15 year old) and I have only heard from her now and then but not to me directly; until she moved to the other side of the world (South Africa). Although we\u2019ve been close by blood, we\u2019ve never been closer than close friends! The only thing I have shared with her is that even though we\u2019ve been out to high school, I always had the distinct feeling in the back of my mind that she is \u201cspecial\u201d and has something unique about her. And this feeling was intensified just after we moved to the other side of the world. After almost ten years we finally met face to face; in fact, I\u2019ve met her parents and siblings and she was even expecting a baby. Wow, I\u2019ve never seen a bride more beautiful and happier than her. Even though it\u2019s been almost four years, she still amazes me with her beauty even years later.","token_len":294,"entropy":[7.8292,4.1184,3.8998,7.4537,0.8478,3.9844,8.4846,3.2681,4.6867,5.6006,2.365,0.4951,0.8771,0.6303,2.7446,0.5767,2.5643,5.1606,6.2657,1.6526,0.5825,3.8268,1.8833,1.0963,4.0735,0.1152,3.4524,4.0466,4.0344,1.8026,3.5538,5.2001,4.459,5.6555,2.2688,6.165,2.6391,3.7918,0.8078,3.6533,0.5244,4.9856,0.1385,1.1032,3.4249,2.4132,6.4218,8.2697,1.1447,2.4173,1.7069,6.2246,5.4261,1.3047,3.9117,2.9513,16.35,8.2257,1.8068,2.7183,5.9916,8.4502,2.6687,3.4733,4.1535,2.6044,3.4422,2.1049,1.7747,0.9632,1.4607,1.1879,0.0196,5.7486,8.6514,0.0489,2.1906,3.5066,2.0505,0.5837,1.644,6.5526,1.2807,3.8079,5.7721,1.8635,2.9494,2.7115,2.7935,0.0678,1.0939,3.7768,1.7404,2.5266,0.5836,0.8833,1.5058,1.0822,3.1228,3.6346,5.1268,6.0484,3.5041,0.3825,2.388,0.7408,2.6186,5.0684,4.4045,4.2849,3.058,3.7603,4.1924,2.5982,3.0055,2.3826,6.1545,4.0687,4.1162,7.1657,6.6171,7.436,2.9716,5.9401,1.3699,2.3329,4.1844,0.4332,0.2352,0.555,0.8773,3.284,7.3519,1.2618,0.8597,6.0772,1.3851,14.5542,0.1174,1.1612,1.2787,4.1743,6.1431,9.5706,1.5059,1.1607,3.5809,0.194,0.8283,1.6378,2.326,5.0462,1.7685,5.8597,1.2038,6.127,4.0364,3.2893,1.1298,1.6689,2.3856,5.5712,0.7058,0.1552,0.7752,1.2761,5.6476,0.383,0.793,3.5552,0.1005,0.0142,1.0891,5.9749,4.5515,9.7307,0.1453,1.8875,2.6624,3.4708,3.349,2.1596,6.6277,0.4679,5.6656,3.195,0.5178,0.1204,0.0631,0.3547,0.2746,1.6198,3.5152,9.4603,4.7154,7.2265,3.1979,6.6664,1.9565,4.659,4.3688,4.3706,2.1942,0.2511,0.8691,4.3087,3.5815,3.6053,3.082,7.4675,5.8343,2.8752,0.7345,3.7066,0.6701,1.0923,0.9747,0.122,0.0954,0.0636,0.1029,0.8421,4.4157,6.0408,4.1314,0.1947,3.4987,3.6337,1.9439,7.0734,0.1295,0.0004,5.4796,3.757,2.6022,0.644,2.1411,4.0078,0.2543,0.6388,3.275,0.9972,7.9605,2.3535,3.7801,2.8404,2.1326,2.0842,4.1558,7.7094,2.7114,1.5089,1.352,7.9522,0.8356,1.9869,4.8705,0.1777,0.0969,2.221,1.7751,2.2667,6.9248,6.3426,1.0313,1.4791,8.649,0.9978,2.3934,1.2378,4.7582,0.843,2.824,3.9617,0.1987,1.4673,2.6906,3.3356,4.127,0.2215,1.9611,2.1648,1.3924,8.0575,0.0234,0.0666,1.5016,0.7597,1.798,6.1324,7.3405,0.9651,0.4631]}
{"prompt":"A man has lived his whole life sinfully , with the intent on going to hell and killing Satan . He has just died .","text":"A man has lived his whole life sinfully, with the intent on going to hell and killing Satan. He has just died. He has no opportunity for forgiveness. So when he arrives to heaven, he is given no option. He is instantly caught at the door to the promised land. What would be the purpose of waiting for him to repent before he was given the entrance to the promised land? Why would Jesus not just let him enter? And more importantly, why would he make it so terribly difficult, that he would be damned in that moment of judgement.\nI am trying to put this scenario together and I think I have a pretty good guess at the truth. Satan would like to kill Jesus so he can gain greater power by killing a God, He himself is. So he starts the work on Jesus by seducing him to renounce his God. The plan is to convince him to go back to the pagan practice of paganism and to follow Satan. Once he does this, Satan will have the power to kill God himself, Jesus and all those who follow him by breaking covenant with God.\nSo Satan waits for him to die. He does wait. He waits for the end of his earthly life. He waits for the day he is resurrected, that he could have spent with his family on this earth. Instead Satan uses this time as an opportunity to do his best job in convincing him the way to eternal life is on the road he has chosen.","token_len":295,"entropy":[7.3022,3.6263,7.7042,4.1663,2.3044,0.0299,12.131,2.907,1.2444,4.0979,2.3876,3.9282,7.4662,5.8793,0.8438,1.5626,2.5183,4.0333,6.9947,0.7302,1.7875,1.6668,5.8768,4.3915,1.7834,1.4636,1.4422,3.0558,6.2256,2.0794,3.2529,0.823,4.4706,3.6658,1.081,6.4334,2.9465,4.4896,0.7837,0.4609,1.762,4.9544,3.5494,4.0148,2.0336,1.0594,1.1454,8.3449,5.1416,5.8651,0.4822,4.2171,4.3787,2.5302,6.4131,0.0688,1.0535,4.8257,3.651,2.8449,0.8834,4.1445,0.1864,6.2631,0.9238,1.5248,1.3514,4.1584,3.3318,1.1362,5.1265,3.4597,1.3748,9.3469,0.4727,1.8337,0.64,0.0213,0.2909,3.6727,1.3376,4.226,3.7297,4.1333,3.5695,0.6553,3.3843,1.7988,3.114,6.5363,0.7878,0.2617,0.6286,0.3898,1.0138,4.6725,2.6614,1.191,9.2278,0.7861,5.2108,4.8249,0.7254,0.7587,2.1512,6.4647,3.1323,4.4683,2.215,2.92,6.9699,3.6739,1.2802,6.2193,2.7049,4.6385,0.0804,4.4365,1.5649,8.3363,2.5215,3.1326,2.9713,2.4126,2.7085,1.4289,2.0007,2.0609,0.3618,5.5876,1.9148,1.8389,5.1479,0.9022,6.1394,3.5754,4.1722,0.3953,3.058,1.8703,3.5737,1.2098,0.7969,5.0945,6.971,0.6131,4.2328,2.2579,4.3281,5.7787,3.3029,6.1774,6.9963,2.1623,7.7851,2.7899,1.9391,4.8669,3.6526,5.3108,3.4808,5.4891,3.2249,7.0707,0.0163,1.5254,2.7898,8.2835,0.0033,0.8594,4.3185,1.4006,3.0495,4.0007,0.5419,0.801,4.1958,1.1212,1.0039,2.803,2.7499,0.2884,1.267,7.681,7.5767,0.1081,5.0925,0.503,1.4921,1.9645,4.2324,3.2891,1.6091,4.6208,0.7094,2.0782,1.5865,0.2738,2.248,1.216,2.9693,2.4,1.1991,0.1711,1.806,5.415,3.7117,2.048,5.3018,3.645,1.949,2.8569,0.8196,1.4306,0.4654,5.4314,6.4565,8.1478,0.6659,2.0721,0.4961,1.4528,2.176,3.035,7.0568,0.9015,1.9676,0.8735,4.2815,1.6739,1.1886,2.8517,8.792,2.5531,1.0566,1.2568,1.2658,1.5233,3.0258,0.431,1.483,4.9684,0.2856,0.5372,1.2477,0.3979,0.369,1.0024,4.2846,2.7052,1.7615,3.0258,2.275,3.0715,0.8505,6.3591,3.6095,7.553,6.8229,0.9524,1.1772,5.1258,3.6827,0.7903,1.0783,6.3104,4.8872,5.9331,2.0779,1.7842,2.5649,1.8773,0.1497,0.1587,4.5121,2.3441,3.5351,6.079,3.0377,5.8588,1.2833,5.8434,3.8772,0.8616,3.6099,0.2648,1.7402,6.5608,1.2802,4.0822,4.9724,1.8257,1.8584,0.5915]}

I saw it so fast, I couldn't even look at it, but I figured it would have to be a really fast car. I called mom and dad about my latest \"find \", they told me to go out to the car a and have a look, and if it was a really good car I could drive it. I was a little disappointed because it didn't seem that fast. But I was a big fan of cars, so I left anyway. When I got to the car park, I looked at the car and it was a little slow.

But it was cool, though, because I have one of my own.","token_len":295,"entropy":[3.4158,4.573,10.7747,1.5677,1.5761,3.4743,5.703,0.1965,2.2434,5.2566,0.9493,1.2688,2.72,1.2333,2.8367,3.9343,0.0007,7.0091,1.8543,1.2602,1.0664,2.5098,1.0552,2.684,0.4544,3.9658,1.6605,3.7047,1.3541,0.8693,2.8927,3.8544,2.0452,2.1586,5.0759,5.77,1.3555,1.1934,1.0735,1.879,0.0003,1.295,5.5402,0.7351,4.5183,2.1845,3.5169,1.034,2.4552,4.15,1.9494,4.267,4.0587,5.495,0.0003,1.9334,8.9104,0.5074,1.0212,1.1977,5.8864,8.2641,0.2698,1.7475,1.9831,2.8613,6.3295,1.3685,9.0424,2.1637,3.6724,4.2812,1.8573,2.2763,0.5756,2.6516,0.8266,0.8476,3.951,1.1329,8.206,2.2528,0.0681,4.2824,2.575,0.4034,1.0171,1.1013,5.6708,1.4125,0.0185,4.7334,6.1496,0.111,7.514,0.9207,4.4375,2.7846,1.2915,0.8386,3.9392,0.6422,5.8267,0.8274,5.106,2.5211,4.9538,2.0241,4.2349,2.4715,2.9263,1.7774,3.757,4.563,0.3099,8.2596,0.9517,3.608,0.0679,0.5864,4.757,6.1752,0.1781,0.7205,6.7285,5.6535,5.13,6.0496,0.7993,1.4125,3.0643,2.3945,4.9841,1.6973,1.134,0.9063,2.4219,0.0002,2.7352,4.0119,0.843,0.276,2.7022,1.6078,0.9191,5.3131,0.9689,2.9144,3.8395,1.6496,0.4795,1.5028,4.6104,2.7913,0.2559,0.5059,1.2723,4.779,10.3042,0.6673,2.0245,5.4857,5.3591,7.6028,6.8683,7.3005,10.0086,4.2294,2.0956,0.0222,1.8791,2.1518,3.6537,2.3992,0.8104,2.2913,7.5003,7.2714,5.6307,0.726,0.6663,2.1491,1.3254,4.9746,2.153,1.2924,0.9808,2.9029,2.26,1.0077,2.3109,2.1197,3.0602,0.415,1.3269,1.2143,2.4271,3.6088,0.7422,2.9741,2.3672,2.0832,2.9277,0.0007,2.4253,2.9447,2.1627,1.0653,2.3121,1.3566,2.298,3.361,2.2354,0.2214,0.2194,1.9372,1.267,1.2979,0.368,6.0959,5.52,0.5702,4.1115,0.365,1.2478,2.5459,0.9794,1.351,6.0129,0.4719,0.7965,3.7173,0.9838,0.7995,2.9319,1.3199,2.1826,0.5639,1.7138,3.6526,4.4525,0.8959,1.1999,3.6822,1.6916,4.684,1.6388,2.7312,0.9502,0.4516,4.1092,2.3893,6.8734,10.7917,7.7673,4.7145,2.4142,5.0897,0.3861,3.4261,2.6142,2.8976,1.6063,3.5215,1.5394,3.6581,2.0225,1.5613,0.5086,4.1997,5.7007,2.7951,0.4357,5.4737,1.9186,1.0921,0.8809,0.338,1.1798,3.6511,2.3499,0.6952,5.7203,1.3351,6.4082,1.5444,1.4171,1.2102,4.5934,4.2933,1.3815,2.6522,1.9572,1.3495]}

The reason is a simple one: a home's design must scale to the number of people you plan to live in it! Not all homes come in the standard American sizes. This can be a great challenge for first-time home buyers and the home's design may require remodeling.\nWhen you factor in a budget for remodeling, you must remember that not all projects are the same. Home renovation projects can vary in their costs and completion times due to various factors. The costs and completion times of remodel projects vary based on your home's size and the scope of the project. Let's take a deeper look into the costs of specific remodels, how much your house could cost to remodel, and the estimated time it takes to finish the project!","token_len":296,"entropy":[7.8996,0.0468,0.2951,4.9523,3.73,4.7094,4.9931,9.6943,2.4359,1.3906,3.6444,0.7102,10.6295,11.7161,0.9573,2.0573,3.3818,3.122,3.5377,7.9539,3.2079,9.0435,1.2905,10.2582,5.9418,1.225,2.0802,7.3688,3.8329,7.6104,6.4041,11.9146,5.8369,5.0297,0.4832,1.6885,4.2032,1.6739,3.4239,2.9888,6.438,8.3682,2.3689,8.1354,2.5933,5.8945,4.0996,6.7605,3.7937,2.629,9.5629,5.9841,1.3354,0.0015,5.1059,4.6425,1.8492,0.9139,5.6009,0.7292,0.1594,4.2456,8.3954,0.0223,0.01,1.4884,3.2538,2.2613,2.9263,4.4853,1.8473,1.9585,4.8403,1.6985,4.2321,7.7333,8.0652,8.4301,0.3293,2.6503,4.9975,0.9918,0.0591,5.2624,3.5921,3.6825,0.4828,2.1965,4.9577,5.3624,1.8612,1.4206,0.0053,2.8266,2.1284,0.3291,0.7041,1.7693,0.7654,5.4196,4.5475,2.8788,9.6241,3.8527,0.4432,1.2102,2.3686,4.7655,3.824,0.8914,3.1255,5.5526,1.4806,7.178,5.605,2.7252,6.353,10.9089,3.5721,5.1967,11.5999,1.182,1.8912,1.1423,2.711,3.4352,6.9655,2.1064,4.1114,4.4022,5.6351,3.8276,6.5537,0.1746,6.588,1.646,2.8267,4.9281,2.7141,7.2879,0.681,0.5485,2.8385,6.0667,1.9962,4.2939,2.4812,0.4203,0.902,3.2421,2.1898,5.103,4.9073,3.1125,8.3246,1.9556,2.3039,5.6724,0.1481,1.9692,2.0589,4.643,0.2648,1.6501,0.6938,2.9971,5.6789,6.7002,2.0501,1.8017,4.8279,4.2251,1.372,6.5501,8.2636,3.3717,1.5091,4.5088,2.1474,0.8217,1.825,3.5882,2.9489,1.6468,6.8137,2.029,0.2315,0.3708,1.1607,2.77,4.04,3.5046,3.3616,2.8466,3.1155,3.6285,6.9304,0.1613,1.2494,0.9201,4.3517,2.0267,6.4606,0.0787,3.7554,4.2657,2.9313,3.5937,0.1073,0.7404,1.5488,3.9109,5.8074,0.5988,5.3739,0.4251,6.9192,1.2952,3.2761,0.0442,0.4665,4.738,2.7624,2.6139,1.8972,2.9002,1.4756,3.7407,3.0476,1.2634,7.3811,1.4925,5.5201,0.0033,3.1464,0.3481,1.0046,2.943,5.6738,3.3817,1.668,0.1479,0.9867,3.8179,2.7448,0.7397,1.4118,3.2903,0.067,2.7643,2.6379,0.4831,1.308,1.1238,2.3739,5.6773,0.108,1.2785,0.1925,0.3126,6.3913,0.2413,1.3918,0.2477,6.8103,0.0472,2.7391,1.1093,3.4319,0.9432,7.4649,2.3231,1.0061,3.0417,3.9649,1.998,4.2664,3.8875,4.259,0.1736,2.2478,2.5062,0.0026,0.6723,0.2428,2.4401,5.1627,2.5849,1.3512,1.1715,0.5274,3.0152,1.5074,0.5669,3.733]}

How did these party goers end up here? We have a theory...\nDwarfs and llamas are a rare sight today. A few years back they were the new 'cool' - hip 'people', but the truth is most of us do not know what is going on in the world outside our houses. We may see some of them on occasion or in movies ( but just barely ) - and have never seen them together in a real-life setting. We think that a new form of therapy called Fancy Therapy might allow us to take a peek out the window and explore the world more deeply and with more empathy?\nWe call these 'therapy animals' - animals who have been specially trained to look down on and engage with the viewer. They are like puppets - and while they may appear to behave in a 'primitive' manner as our children played dress-up dolls - they are intelligent and very entertaining.

I wasn't planning to visit... I am the type of person that can't just decide to go somewhere for a vacation or something. I love to travel, but I haven't been to a few places due to health problems. I can've been to New Orleans, New York, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, Denver and a few others... so I know how important a vacation is to the body, mind and spirit. I am not planning on taking a vacation in the near future, so it has been on the back-burner.\nAfter my health improved a little in the last few years, I began looking into New Forest. They have a wonderful spa that is located at The Old Stone House. I read many articles about this old stone farmhouse as soon as it was built. People from all over the place are coming for the health benefits. I decided to go check it out. I love walking. It's my favorite form of exercise. I decided to take a trip to New Forest a few weekends ago.","token_len":298,"entropy":[2.8744,1.2771,9.919,3.9458,5.3486,6.1995,2.0658,8.032,4.7994,3.5491,4.4688,2.7818,5.2829,0.3561,3.6857,5.0491,0.853,1.2258,1.5914,2.099,0.0613,7.6243,0.8602,7.0194,5.211,0.717,4.4089,8.323,1.2582,2.2127,3.8341,0.5331,1.437,0.1712,4.2088,1.4405,1.1719,5.0178,3.563,0.2163,0.3431,1.1461,4.3194,2.9454,2.5204,2.3566,3.7757,3.6313,2.8117,0.4216,5.6517,0.9425,1.0896,4.1642,7.4977,9.0929,4.4705,6.633,4.4621,3.4097,1.1718,5.8491,0.6865,2.3332,9.9064,1.5148,3.2992,0.4814,3.4838,1.8456,5.0896,0.5835,0.8469,7.0414,4.3379,6.5198,4.8933,1.4985,5.4858,2.957,1.8999,0.4671,2.8906,1.9302,1.5365,4.9864,1.4305,1.7159,3.8103,0.922,1.2873,5.1853,0.0013,5.2197,1.6367,3.5262,7.0096,1.9556,4.8965,4.8987,3.8084,0.2297,0.1383,1.8975,4.1026,1.3984,5.0574,6.4444,1.4663,1.8504,2.836,3.873,1.0838,3.9638,2.3845,2.0587,0.6994,1.0213,4.3999,2.7387,2.1552,1.5811,1.9562,0.9527,4.7925,0.0012,1.3481,0.8555,1.9214,5.356,0.5619,6.157,0.0153,5.1579,2.5317,1.0636,0.9458,4.0865,8.6336,2.3515,1.1368,5.0377,2.5418,1.11,3.0794,0.3387,0.6032,3.1591,0.267,4.0349,0.2891,5.4615,0.3833,5.1087,2.7851,3.8103,0.4449,1.9914,2.8923,3.6656,0.7523,3.9762,2.9509,3.318,3.8993,2.4022,0.6569,1.5155,4.3586,5.7187,2.086,1.9361,0.4833,1.3114,0.5572,1.2799,3.175,2.6613,4.0272,0.5373,3.9437,1.09,0.9315,3.17,1.4722,2.7262,0.0055,1.6318,2.7681,3.3138,4.4513,0.8673,6.0714,2.7013,1.0819,5.4926,0.0908,0.0159,1.9986,2.2238,4.4164,3.2318,7.7605,5.3078,1.6241,1.4038,3.4025,1.6922,1.3094,1.3008,0.7386,0.4792,0.2561,3.8051,3.7521,1.7839,6.2626,10.6989,1.7863,4.5062,1.4332,1.1346,3.5003,5.1629,2.5039,1.3508,3.7874,2.3847,5.1816,5.4833,6.5443,2.5894,1.1238,1.4805,5.3767,4.1237,2.6471,0.4448,2.2826,7.3197,4.0237,5.8006,4.3829,5.5713,5.083,0.0132,3.362,1.1768,1.8354,0.8971,4.8872,3.7453,1.2526,0.4038,0.4767,4.0381,3.2018,3.069,4.1525,2.1622,5.6533,1.2696,1.3118,1.5047,5.0647,0.1789,1.99,4.7237,0.7151,0.0267,0.8463,1.2881,3.7699,4.9681,4.1759,1.9083,1.3889,4.9759,0.5799,6.7773,0.013,2.2572,0.6821,1.2465,6.4063,0.1881,2.3722,0.8029,3.393,0.8214,2.2673,0.7729,5.2104,0.4549,6.0381,0.253,0.6728]}
{"prompt":"You wake up to find yourself in an out of body experience .

Everything's going great, until you notice your body starting to move on its own. You then see your spirit, not as the spirit it was before but rather as your mind in another body. You also notice a feeling in your shoulders and throat, like a weight, that is trying to break free\nI am reading the book \"The Power of the New and the Invisible\" by John Harvey Kellogg. He talks about this phenomenon on page 131:\n\"It is well known that at certain points in the course of evolution the mentality of man has changed from being a passive recipient of ideas -- what we may call the Old and the Invisible -- to being a creative agent in its own domain and with an attitude of absolute independence -- what we may call the New and the Visible. The latter state is in a degree psychologically similar to the point at which the animals evolved, but in all its essential features it is a new phase.\"\nSomewhat like that. I have been experimenting for the past 7 or 8 years. I have seen my spirit twice, the first time was in a dream which I woke up to. I could tell it was my spirit because it was wearing blue gloves. The second time was in my dream, that I am very familiar with, and again I could tell it was my spirit. It is also interesting to see people move in their dreams, not just the arms and legs.","token_len":298,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.4797,2.9569,2.5202,1.6088,2.9317,6.6975,1.8125,2.3889,0.1194,1.3957,6.0394,3.0089,3.085,3.5516,1.5086,5.9933,0.5268,3.8367,2.5704,1.8265,6.4779,0.0613,4.0811,3.887,1.9601,0.0414,0.4901,2.0925,5.9284,4.0507,1.8604,7.3719,3.6806,5.7322,3.0108,2.9621,5.3144,5.4424,1.2868,1.0025,1.9599,3.5754,0.301,3.2892,4.7588,4.826,5.3652,1.9948,0.6371,1.993,4.8454,1.8311,3.3888,3.5311,3.935,0.2476,7.2291,1.2608,6.5142,1.6915,4.1829,1.9145,4.8433,5.4525,2.116,1.8351,4.6513,0.0377,5.0201,2.7643,9.4365,7.3854,3.0397,6.7206,2.5805,1.6328,3.4447,1.8303,4.3304,0.1667,2.3822,5.2246,4.5884,1.3567,7.0085,1.2791,0.6443,3.9288,7.2376,8.2248,0.0581,0.8259,2.4228,3.2766,0.0964,3.4116,3.558,5.3893,4.0277,6.0813,2.9531,0.8957,2.2809,3.4547,1.04,5.7614,0.1512,0.2477,5.7577,2.9129,2.0595,0.6993,1.9429,2.3798,0.0013,5.0138,2.78,9.7989,0.8768,3.6598,2.1113,1.3257,2.656,1.9919,1.317,3.9251,8.4403,0.2115,4.5088,7.7495,5.138,1.8496,5.4402,0.143,1.8694,7.2644,2.367,0.8149,6.7859,0.4204,0.2607,1.5519,0.9552,5.0691,4.2511,2.7865,5.4039,0.4437,9.1816,3.2537,5.6905,3.5365,5.6532,1.0641,6.7582,4.7986,4.6355,4.9882,1.0775,1.5501,0.1288,0.6042,1.3323,0.577,0.0786,8.1402,0.0328,0.8561,2.0703,5.0427,5.9173,1.4379,4.272,2.9722,6.454,9.1621,3.5083,0.0602,0.5194,10.7836,2.2135,0.0096,1.4239,8.5007,3.8323,3.136,1.7378,2.1336,6.0564,1.8767,6.1801,3.0936,2.0565,0.611,2.3309,3.2895,4.7257,3.515,0.5635,7.3249,2.9328,1.7271,2.7224,3.4554,3.1693,2.7681,2.8513,2.2608,6.8199,4.1458,2.7715,0.677,4.7675,3.6172,0.1585,0.5563,2.8167,0.8455,1.2526,3.4022,3.4931,3.1193,8.8293,1.8367,3.8838,0.1883,0.3114,5.6165,1.7682,1.4347,4.2349,5.0283,1.2531,4.3442,0.1723,1.3997,3.3777,1.2169,4.5243,4.0145,1.5498,0.2067,3.1029,1.7346,4.8423,1.4415,0.8248,5.7756,5.8462,5.5901,1.3269,2.0538,0.3855,0.0676,0.7333,1.1506,2.3635,2.0257,1.8774,5.0577,2.2545,5.9124,4.9309,4.0377,0.0682,3.0298,1.5456,6.3893,1.5203,1.6798,0.364,0.3018,0.1036,0.2609,0.1508,1.052,2.4744,1.9337,3.9325,2.9863,0.7496,2.9047,5.0816,6.2356,2.6362,3.3095,2.6467,1.9885,3.8036,1.5823,3.1785,7.5048,1.3084,0.3619,2.2643]}

{"prompt":"Write about a lie or deceitful act .","text":"Write about a lie or deceitful act. This is usually a good thing, because it means a person is a fighter and not a coward.\nAn example of lying that has always stuck in my mind occurs when our little dog named Toshiyuki was about 2 1\/2 years of age. We thought it was cute to watch her chase a squirrel, and I am sure I have exaggerated her mischief here to make it a little more fun. But she always started running by herself and getting a better idea about where the squirrel was hiding. We thought the squirrel started to panic and ran away. We waited until the squirrel ran out a window, and then Toshiyuki pounced on it and brought it home. Then we sat down to eat, and as soon as our food was set out, she ran and climbed up on the chair, sniffed out some pieces of rabbit and threw them to the dog\u2019s bowl. We laughed so hard that I forgot to smile. I know she lied, and I never realized it because of her loving and obedient nature. She just seemed to always be acting like a good doggy. The only time I ever heard her swear was when she was a puppy and her father put her down for a few minutes. Just like our little girls who were taught not to lie, we never talked about it, because we were so happy to be having our first little doggie. I don\u2019t think we ever got over that event.","token_len":299,"entropy":[6.0771,3.5213,9.5654,2.7664,5.5149,4.667,2.3271,2.1453,4.1468,1.1825,3.9861,1.9614,3.1466,2.0313,1.5029,1.5633,1.1569,2.8629,4.2254,1.5312,1.8982,5.4945,8.4194,1.9095,2.6774,0.6693,2.5516,0.3003,1.4281,11.3065,1.7171,0.5521,4.4361,5.4133,3.7977,5.9281,4.4231,2.1854,0.4274,0.4433,9.3163,0.4868,7.3949,6.0683,4.9649,5.4937,11.2762,6.9762,1.6867,2.8081,5.2861,4.5181,5.2063,0.0026,0.0322,0.2432,6.2825,0.0042,0.8193,2.942,4.5668,2.2639,0.3182,3.0466,3.3768,3.5928,3.0538,5.5657,1.6597,2.4404,1.6868,2.101,3.6148,5.7373,2.1998,3.849,3.6842,7.1761,2.4626,8.1602,5.8533,4.2001,1.4774,1.3973,4.2241,1.3446,0.7369,2.8837,0.3382,1.9835,3.0081,5.918,4.7067,2.1961,6.2023,2.581,1.676,5.9543,3.8953,5.7695,6.3831,3.1217,1.9564,2.536,0.3153,0.4095,4.2607,0.4475,2.7374,2.5414,3.3327,0.4186,7.2637,2.1664,6.1751,0.786,2.478,1.4719,1.0135,2.3184,6.6792,1.1694,2.053,0.6427,3.5244,2.6124,6.3555,6.1245,1.8225,1.246,1.0122,4.286,0.0197,0.0009,8.0234,0.2554,0.3897,1.1798,1.3167,6.4115,0.4914,2.4075,0.3854,4.0192,1.0967,5.1803,1.4284,1.8605,2.5148,2.1682,0.4082,4.4801,3.0107,0.0015,3.7315,3.7398,0.8067,7.913,4.6577,1.0051,2.6696,1.653,4.3511,6.9375,1.8078,1.3585,1.6854,4.8776,2.5319,6.6633,0.4776,2.5795,3.0397,7.0192,0.1119,6.8408,3.1551,4.623,0.3755,3.9726,0.5975,4.8663,15.8561,7.5941,5.0034,7.9386,0.378,2.2639,4.3193,3.4334,0.2545,1.206,2.6244,4.4678,1.2552,5.7947,1.0848,3.022,4.4731,3.1282,7.3621,1.6476,2.0447,0.8735,5.3788,4.9398,1.3673,3.9709,3.6015,1.9301,7.2045,2.6276,5.197,1.1921,0.2964,2.8154,3.8849,4.7445,0.9157,5.6121,1.677,6.2344,1.3573,0.7741,1.8683,8.3367,3.2863,0.8025,3.8244,3.177,1.8045,0.6328,1.3814,2.8513,0.7796,7.5555,0.9423,0.2126,0.595,1.2499,4.1715,2.4823,1.9833,3.6842,3.5848,4.7408,0.8083,2.0541,2.6922,1.6344,3.949,1.8545,1.1708,6.3898,1.8517,4.6546,0.6488,7.6212,4.7554,2.8778,5.3645,3.4475,0.0028,2.2539,1.2899,2.2985,2.7593,5.3525,0.2466,1.3335,2.6411,2.3092,1.2738,1.9959,2.5674,3.3397,1.2765,1.7549,5.0217,3.0147,5.094,3.9975,3.7498,1.5159,1.0772,2.9678,3.1557,11.0666,1.0599,0.144,1.3819,1.867,1.2814,3.7542,2.765,1.6111,9.2548,0.7786]}

It was a time to learn new things, to think about the future, to meet different people.

People who live with you every day, or spend a lot of time with you, do not make you happy, even if they are the love of your life.","token_len":300,"entropy":[6.9592,3.535,2.9168,2.1165,5.6387,0.9804,2.3032,2.1357,11.1289,3.4087,7.1192,0.6816,1.9123,1.2593,9.9847,2.471,1.6052,2.2284,1.1873,2.3294,5.3902,0.2669,5.4254,3.8008,1.8872,2.4167,2.8595,3.8445,9.1951,3.0937,6.9549,3.7288,6.721,8.7068,1.6493,0.7125,1.8125,6.2727,0.0028,4.8124,0.1754,1.4236,1.5874,6.0265,0.365,2.2803,3.1415,2.6323,1.8445,2.5867,6.7341,0.6711,0.0384,0.9423,0.6752,4.2534,3.8948,0.4983,0.9937,1.7139,5.9885,0.3143,4.0141,0.3536,2.7874,4.5055,5.8639,4.2424,4.429,3.3898,1.3976,3.7896,2.4573,4.745,0.6429,2.4549,7.8923,3.3528,4.2214,5.2613,3.1465,0.8218,2.793,4.9538,6.2171,1.2343,3.0006,5.9994,0.0008,2.5877,4.5667,7.2576,0.1423,2.0412,4.2077,3.0657,0.4011,0.2364,7.0037,1.5281,3.165,2.5519,6.9686,3.517,1.6444,2.4384,0.0003,2.0308,6.0023,0.0225,0.8754,3.4104,5.8445,4.2607,2.5232,6.6476,1.1799,3.2695,1.0697,2.0419,4.8854,1.8608,3.2878,3.7658,0.2663,0.78,1.3093,3.2523,1.3736,1.8651,0.5757,0.794,0.6412,6.1182,5.2723,0.252,1.1784,2.4739,0.5174,0.8638,0.3132,0.4059,4.3172,1.3198,1.7401,3.5184,0.9231,6.7385,0.7681,4.3149,4.5748,6.0687,0.1495,4.573,1.8698,3.8212,0.7869,4.7821,0.7631,5.1763,4.7904,3.8156,3.4739,6.9212,3.9947,0.8167,1.7735,4.2402,2.8687,3.0894,6.4283,6.5128,1.0604,2.9845,1.1196,1.364,2.9281,3.5902,2.0725,3.0519,2.7532,0.1725,0.2409,0.2118,3.6697,4.459,0.3115,3.6888,0.3196,2.388,5.536,1.1744,1.6171,3.7454,1.4506,0.5636,0.0168,3.6677,4.8171,1.0596,0.2322,10.0954,7.4906,4.3657,4.8475,4.0011,0.1396,3.9256,9.1988,0.2793,0.4346,0.1099,0.735,0.7513,4.0552,1.8211,2.1481,4.8421,2.822,7.1991,1.0957,0.053,3.9554,2.3723,1.2517,4.5244,0.5178,8.756,0.372,0.3475,1.584,1.7859,2.1316,3.4729,3.3627,3.1927,0.2323,2.2408,0.9173,2.0656,3.7497,0.5298,6.9517,2.7019,0.4421,3.0697,0.51,0.9942,4.1464,2.421,4.6577,0.0007,2.0659,2.822,0.1176,1.1891,3.2529,2.034,2.4355,1.3823,2.4648,2.1418,1.7766,0.0838,2.4064,0.5938,5.1208,2.104,3.8576,1.87,1.8333,5.7654,0.1215,1.902,3.7675,4.147,1.7407,0.1434,0.0154,0.1461,0.8365,0.3969,0.4791,3.4922,0.3165,3.9588,0.1834,0.2575,1.4506,4.7216,0.4764,0.6487,1.6953,4.5034,5.9726,0.5418,0.7922,0.0256,0.3231]}

The bible is one of the best books of morals and ethics but it is human bias and interpretation that makes it seem like it is so specific and clear.

You have to deliver the knowledge to them quickly otherwise they would give you the middle finger.The problem is you are now over 40 so you are no longer in the form and in the age of them! And you have to do whatever is necessary now. I know that it hurts and it will hurt for a while but you need to put all that experience to good use and teach the student. I have seen quite a few examples where the instructor has come to a new school where they have the student in a certain form and he or she can deliver the knowledge and they don't have to do so much preparation but when they have not been taught in this manner then things go awry and the student gives the instruction and then the instructor goes on about it and the student feels that the instructor doesn't know what it was he was actually trying to teach. I have seen a number of students give a wrong lesson and the instructor is just too busy explaining it. The instructor can ask the student if he knows the correct exercise and the student will not be able to explain it. He will just tell him what it is to give a wrong answer while the instructor can't do anything.\nThe instructor should be doing more training of the student or it will affect the other students.

And I believe in your words.","token_len":302,"entropy":[10.1184,6.0337,3.0367,5.6323,7.5474,0.0851,3.6622,1.746,7.6175,3.6312,3.3809,1.8377,3.112,7.3787,2.3738,4.5932,0.0003,3.2221,0.5767,1.7034,5.201,0.0009,5.4177,0.8332,3.7715,4.5703,2.6932,5.5977,1.8488,6.2437,0.233,1.751,0.6595,4.5736,4.8018,6.0741,3.3448,1.4698,0.3815,3.5677,1.9826,1.747,4.0968,2.6424,0.5183,5.1219,2.5101,7.055,3.4945,5.6779,3.2867,0.0227,2.2079,1.9661,0.6196,2.9449,8.3656,7.5843,2.07,2.6104,0.4187,2.7992,8.4435,8.3212,1.61,4.1609,3.671,3.1777,4.1522,1.4818,5.4431,3.8602,1.5672,0.5926,4.6611,3.8636,1.0848,1.5101,4.8425,0.3257,2.9872,2.0567,0.7153,1.0898,0.7076,0.1012,1.5118,0.8556,0.5686,0.93,4.7839,1.0008,0.3287,5.9228,4.822,1.0568,0.0718,1.2803,1.3086,6.0176,3.0161,4.4392,1.0024,1.3539,4.2297,5.4511,3.5581,1.2584,2.9819,3.1602,0.336,4.3558,2.6739,4.2114,7.264,1.952,4.4168,3.1113,4.1121,0.8752,3.3467,4.4308,2.6364,3.5485,4.1633,3.0172,3.0729,2.7249,1.5728,2.6177,0.2375,0.6685,1.8382,4.4515,2.8688,1.9215,5.6817,4.8435,3.3773,1.3274,5.3513,5.5885,0.9498,0.8234,5.1582,3.3121,0.3904,2.5718,6.6473,0.8243,5.5463,7.0653,2.4767,4.7338,1.8954,2.084,3.6793,2.1212,0.8671,5.7647,0.6192,1.5026,4.2222,2.0475,1.888,4.8867,3.7106,1.8083,5.4948,8.8311,0.5429,2.9568,3.3628,3.9551,0.1166,3.5239,3.2639,6.9514,4.4384,5.0048,0.8083,1.0984,3.1034,3.6834,1.3967,2.49,1.5554,5.2987,1.7806,3.1931,3.3459,2.1088,2.0885,0.3665,0.8739,2.1819,3.8424,5.4571,1.0412,2.507,4.6142,2.4866,1.4244,0.7248,3.5578,4.2543,3.3542,5.3801,0.1377,0.232,0.9866,5.7337,0.6404,2.6705,0.5599,0.6613,2.2204,4.3865,1.9597,0.3604,1.507,1.5758,1.5469,4.8751,3.4831,3.7712,5.4241,4.3117,5.2641,2.203,0.0577,0.1211,1.666,4.6402,0.1446,2.8944,0.8732,0.8251,1.3088,5.755,0.4305,1.0437,2.0441,5.2481,0.1238,5.3239,0.1634,3.2046,0.9469,0.4473,0.5572,1.2367,2.6641,3.3881,2.0275,3.5,4.0704,5.9358,5.3949,2.0795,0.7802,1.3104,3.8295,4.161,3.3846,3.0334,0.6355,3.7301,2.3916,2.7299,7.2538,1.4078,1.6867,1.3272,4.4593,0.0032,1.3407,5.7318,3.2616,5.621,6.1646,0.5439,3.9322,1.0293,5.5024,4.9279,1.3615,7.9875,1.7786,3.3855,1.1202,4.1941,3.0244,0.3436,3.7731,1.5509,4.2651,1.4815,5.6814,4.9746,0.4155]}

{"prompt":"Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest if the world . Everyone naturally blames climate change , you know the horrifying truth","text":"Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest if the world. Everyone naturally blames climate change, you know the horrifying truths about human influence over climate and you try to convince people that are not on the same page?\nThe only change is just fine that could be blamed on humans at all. It is just a normal change in the global climate. The problem is when we use climate change as some kind of a justification for destroying something or even to destroy humanity itself.\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, in your article you talk about CO2 and the green house effect. So I was confused about if you mean to say that there are other changes like the change in humidity (CO2 is only a tiny part of the green house effect) or if you mean in general you are talking about global warming that is caused by CO2.\nTo make the analogy the CO2 in the air increases the level in the ground of moisture, which in turn increases the plants\u2019 water requirements, but it doesn\u2019t change the overall volume of water in the ground.\nI can\u2019t really give you an answer to your question since the science part of it is very convoluted. We still don\u2019t know why the green house gases trap the heat. We can try to do measurements or even simulate the process but it\u2019s not a straight forward thing to do. This is why global warming and what actually happens to the air around the planet remains mysterious.","token_len":303,"entropy":[3.8827,9.1861,8.6014,2.2483,1.3314,5.0976,0.145,0.1098,1.9879,3.3541,10.3358,1.9226,3.0266,9.2158,8.6537,10.1302,4.7315,2.5796,0.0353,2.2325,6.5952,0.8029,4.9806,11.5399,6.0933,1.856,4.318,4.4156,3.9149,2.2078,2.5425,4.8799,5.9553,0.2814,2.8567,1.8012,0.7317,7.5749,2.6491,4.733,0.7592,2.487,1.3375,4.2904,1.285,7.5758,3.6911,5.7083,2.2908,6.2042,6.2559,5.4778,6.7432,1.4816,5.8597,0.169,2.6333,5.6958,0.9413,0.5192,3.1086,1.5436,2.5974,2.2878,4.897,3.1365,1.9117,1.5109,4.1192,1.2649,0.8728,2.742,3.5236,0.4826,5.1402,2.2419,3.9051,3.0803,0.257,0.9779,5.2102,0.9241,0.0036,4.6553,4.5146,0.42,6.0657,6.1912,3.5348,3.8295,4.8027,3.3419,4.1173,3.2773,0.4863,1.3176,3.4747,1.2288,3.2282,16.1834,7.1141,1.3216,5.8789,2.2539,2.3438,2.7574,5.7617,2.746,4.7039,2.2574,3.7638,0.0982,6.7595,0.116,2.4125,2.3433,6.7416,5.5677,3.8871,1.6905,3.9084,3.5825,4.9687,5.254,2.006,4.5193,1.1503,1.6249,3.2098,0.77,0.7564,3.5655,1.9071,3.8062,3.5774,4.3029,1.7806,5.0902,0.3079,5.7795,4.3058,6.1821,0.0293,2.5218,4.6669,2.4725,3.3793,1.0398,0.1314,0.6015,3.4622,0.5964,0.0741,0.9331,0.6775,2.4634,0.7094,0.2411,5.418,3.3261,3.0937,2.0164,1.5247,0.0472,4.2277,0.184,3.3339,0.9144,2.557,0.1568,2.6463,0.0034,0.8857,1.1154,5.084,3.7709,2.3104,5.9498,5.0453,3.0408,0.0063,2.9688,0.8533,1.4026,4.3052,1.2734,5.2749,4.5755,0.4406,4.1814,3.7597,4.1145,2.4185,2.1512,2.1153,0.0716,1.2118,0.3837,7.9604,11.6279,0.9057,6.2039,6.4544,2.2874,3.8876,2.5603,2.9112,1.5156,0.2358,0.9443,2.0931,0.5085,4.3142,6.2004,0.2679,1.4758,1.0414,0.0746,1.3229,0.7119,1.4015,3.1927,3.7035,3.4093,0.0866,0.0451,4.0836,4.4326,0.3838,1.0466,0.521,2.1747,3.1048,0.1884,4.6468,2.7464,5.8587,7.9917,0.9505,1.2198,0.5286,2.6605,6.3138,0.9092,5.5547,6.1074,1.4792,0.1924,0.2156,0.0138,0.153,3.6253,1.7357,5.1276,0.5159,10.1903,8.4815,2.4011,4.1967,2.719,2.6249,2.4333,5.526,0.4069,5.1814,8.2457,3.9057,3.2001,4.882,1.4907,4.3104,2.3959,1.8961,3.668,0.0787,1.214,1.8138,3.1402,6.5382,1.9615,4.0551,1.1512,0.121,0.5579,4.9507,0.6755,2.022,6.674,0.1378,4.5504,5.6509,7.4386,1.3755,2.1117,0.902,3.4193,4.6499,2.163,2.6206,6.764,3.9847,0.5369]}

They fight. They fight like hell and if they fought a few thousand years in the future they would still both do it.\nSo, you are saying there is a level of time traveling that both jericho and Barry can only go in one direction when it comes to both Jericho using his hands or Barry going into his future self, since they can't go back in time. Not correct? Also, if they could stop Jericho from teleporting, would it be possible for him to go back into his past self?\n\nA:\n\nIn the comics, time travel is usually one-way.  At least for certain events or actions that people can see.  For example, in the past when jericho was using his powers, he showed a picture that was going to be blacked out in seconds.  That was definitely possible to see.  But he could not, and never has, go back in time.  He cannot reverse the fact that he is in the future, and neither can his future son.  The future son just sees what his father will say.  And the current Jericho is not able to go back to his past selves to stop it from happening (like how he tried to do in comics #600).\nWhile you can travel in time, it can be back-and-forth (as we see in the Flash) or one-way (like in the comics).","token_len":305,"entropy":[6.294,4.1152,9.1038,4.7882,2.7595,6.4549,1.4607,6.0788,1.6386,9.9896,2.1824,5.8266,1.4938,1.4958,0.6842,3.9072,1.0755,1.879,5.2018,6.526,1.9791,2.0366,1.6421,3.9131,4.3846,3.1014,5.6807,1.3843,5.8385,4.8578,4.5278,4.2726,0.3899,4.038,0.588,0.0491,1.7252,1.1168,3.0973,8.3797,5.5254,1.5088,0.4949,1.7157,7.4271,2.0119,3.4055,4.019,2.6833,3.8394,0.7353,1.1591,6.3209,0.2721,4.8685,4.6869,1.2299,7.1168,13.3535,9.0167,0.7907,3.3061,1.5204,3.9273,2.0533,3.6151,2.9662,0.2227,4.0194,2.688,1.0059,0.1487,5.4391,10.6785,8.4029,1.4072,6.4655,3.0195,5.434,3.3479,3.0192,2.9117,5.567,4.3341,2.9641,6.137,1.9131,2.774,2.4311,0.9964,2.0663,0.3482,0.0724,1.6939,6.2641,7.9482,2.1361,6.3326,0.5635,2.8929,2.3995,3.3821,6.033,5.2008,1.7522,6.9841,0.0601,2.5133,2.852,2.1971,1.0897,1.2847,1.0609,1.6807,0.0669,1.6609,0.6685,3.2458,0.7253,0.7333,0.1873,1.5798,0.9263,3.8908,4.6697,0.9843,3.8692,0.0002,4.1981,1.2787,3.5461,0.5112,6.7514,0.6934,0.9825,5.4825,4.986,3.8437,1.1348,1.1688,10.1266,12.4446,1.2427,3.2983,4.8591,2.5482,4.615,4.7598,2.5768,5.1195,2.0731,3.851,1.7238,2.5831,2.2126,0.3224,0.1357,2.4112,1.0144,4.5934,4.2962,10.7493,0.0006,1.7083,4.7191,0.2713,3.2812,1.1487,0.7132,6.9511,3.2352,4.0149,4.0834,2.1257,4.2714,0.4137,1.3276,7.4323,2.7645,0.0179,2.8515,5.3462,0.8052,1.1339,3.4301,1.8158,6.0316,3.8132,3.2292,0.9679,1.2886,1.0447,2.202,3.3315,2.1911,1.7483,4.8983,2.178,4.4454,2.8284,1.0842,3.2046,0.4417,0.5185,0.0407,0.7825,1.0328,3.0446,3.8609,7.9327,1.9817,4.6371,0.0932,0.4737,1.5272,2.4087,1.1973,1.8358,1.913,1.868,5.6407,0.1874,3.5791,2.0647,9.0689,0.7301,0.8101,3.4575,3.4411,2.6821,5.6264,5.7913,2.236,3.3134,1.0313,5.1978,3.5066,1.6947,0.7677,2.4178,2.7968,5.3627,6.3443,1.7835,2.5142,3.9785,0.0067,1.4717,0.3258,3.6754,0.6492,0.2401,4.5665,4.4019,2.6045,3.0095,2.018,0.098,5.3729,4.48,4.669,0.9444,5.2307,0.3428,1.7653,1.8731,7.13,6.0407,7.5086,0.9085,0.9727,19.0719,3.6235,1.7324,5.8013,1.5537,1.3411,0.7764,1.9944,3.1275,1.3066,7.8616,4.0587,3.0473,0.0149,0.0115,4.2021,3.7016,4.0924,2.9622,0.3763,0.8441,5.243,3.7188,1.2205,4.1353,0.6034,0.1879,1.2852,1.9716,1.3277,0.7642,3.0388,0.7524]}

And may the odds be ever in your favor. And maybe by killing you it's going to make them feel better.\nIn each of the four books. the main character has to be eliminated from the game until the next season. The only way the book is to read in order is if you buy the games in that order and play them back to back like a good gamer.\nIn Season two, you can play games that are a combination of books and games. It might be easier to follow if you just buy the games in order, although there are a couple of books that have a direct tie in ( or influence ) on the game.\nHere you go and here you get. The Hunger Games is a trilogy book by Suzanne Collins. It tells of 12 kids who have been chosen to be the ultimate representation of their society ( the GAME ). The GAME is set in Panem, where the 12 people ( and 6 adults supporting them ) play a game to see which 3 will live and which 3 will die in a public execution.\nEach year, the same thing happens, so you have a sense of history as to what sort of society is like in Panem, what the world is like. Some of the worlds the books were set in had really terrible things, but even in Hunger Games the world seemed a good enough place to put a story together.","token_len":305,"entropy":[2.295,10.6449,0.1428,4.4248,11.1076,0.0543,1.8759,9.803,1.4316,5.9575,4.8793,0.8681,3.8843,0.2581,8.0464,8.8102,2.5933,0.5855,2.397,1.8599,0.6509,1.6013,0.8559,4.1963,1.6363,2.5517,0.0511,0.6809,4.0582,8.6798,2.1451,3.1487,0.2186,3.0374,0.5758,0.1143,0.063,1.1034,5.0841,3.2426,7.1921,6.0486,3.2136,4.5509,2.2223,2.1853,0.006,1.9935,4.0368,2.6497,1.2169,1.4382,0.9702,11.2364,6.9163,1.1809,0.6859,2.6847,4.4706,7.6061,3.4713,3.5212,1.2729,3.0346,1.4591,2.9283,8.3509,1.9231,0.413,1.1422,5.9682,1.6268,3.5323,4.5148,1.1089,1.9076,3.3984,1.4187,3.5816,4.3511,2.4045,3.741,6.647,3.8677,4.3233,1.5194,1.4119,0.8101,4.3171,1.1055,7.2936,3.0986,5.9142,0.5479,2.599,4.4175,1.0972,6.0239,3.2843,2.3648,6.2217,2.6037,4.9916,7.0623,1.6133,1.8754,2.9171,5.1327,6.9004,1.4865,3.0612,1.9832,1.8367,5.6931,3.0837,1.7328,4.5208,3.9992,0.0544,6.0077,0.8816,2.2338,0.7192,4.0195,5.0967,0.8023,5.71,0.4692,5.488,4.7145,0.0934,2.5424,3.4493,0.7223,1.6174,2.1376,2.5025,2.0856,5.3882,2.9328,0.744,1.9727,2.1489,0.5727,3.3351,0.6919,3.0507,2.2162,6.1403,2.5374,2.6289,6.5997,9.6481,6.1688,1.0764,5.4889,0.7049,2.0246,0.6939,0.9653,5.1311,3.895,3.9528,5.668,4.8217,1.1499,6.0483,7.8473,2.8833,5.8922,0.014,1.9576,1.2922,4.7854,6.3549,4.577,5.3257,0.0368,1.3071,1.6655,3.8551,3.2982,7.6421,4.4322,1.9332,2.6926,1.7381,5.4723,1.0566,2.3132,1.3744,5.0689,9.6671,0.028,2.8809,6.2672,4.075,5.5455,10.5362,2.9428,1.7824,3.3239,0.9355,4.1577,0.4995,10.2048,3.3661,1.2019,4.1561,1.4736,6.6806,4.5372,3.4783,4.2313,4.7717,5.3353,10.0065,0.3821,0.4055,4.3702,1.1531,0.8952,3.7403,3.4356,2.4874,7.201,3.8779,5.0154,2.5181,0.4035,2.5128,0.3766,0.0265,2.1052,2.0755,7.6237,4.6063,0.4579,1.6225,3.5187,3.3285,1.1502,1.1965,6.2718,4.6641,0.14,2.4871,3.4229,2.623,1.7441,2.6602,6.2117,0.2306,5.0352,3.4504,2.8533,1.4367,5.5377,0.0061,2.0425,2.5366,7.3219,1.4477,3.2161,0.002,2.1134,3.8939,3.0845,4.3998,1.6339,0.0367,5.0562,5.1388,1.1032,0.4812,6.2858,4.649,4.5616,3.888,2.4902,0.1381,5.6133,5.361,4.8511,2.5445,3.5847,2.04,5.3658,2.5714,8.2228,0.0126,2.5612,1.401,4.6269,3.4739,5.33,4.3836,0.4703,0.5621,4.7094,2.3497,4.8546,2.7415,0.5818]}

They get to escape unharmed only if they pass. This is a very dark novel. He says all right and then says to the victims just a quick test for our fun. They do the test but a little too easy and the killer comes in and the victims get caught so they are imprisoned and the rest of the book is written in a diary of how they are getting there. They have no help getting there. The story follows several very powerful and evil people along.\nThis novel was written in 1975 and is set in a small town called Greenville. It does not describe too much about it or the characters and it is a very simple story. One day there is a murder and the police investigation takes a long time to solve if it ever does. It sounds boring but the story is very interesting. The main character named Jack is a reporter of a small newspaper. The other characters are named Mr. and Mrs. Baker. The main character looks like a kid. He is a reporter and he is trying to solve the murder and the murderer is also trying to do so. All along the novel the story keeps you guessing what is going to happen and when it gets really boring you just have to grab your journal and start writing or read more pages on other books. The book is just great to get you think and to keep you from getting burned out from your computer.","token_len":305,"entropy":[10.8809,16.9546,0.858,4.9537,3.1077,1.5829,8.563,2.5322,1.3647,4.6478,5.5159,0.2035,7.0519,3.0507,0.2075,1.9069,5.9634,7.352,6.9625,9.4313,0.1214,3.4552,1.8789,7.4778,0.8273,3.5122,4.3079,4.4891,2.8412,8.4934,7.7586,0.4724,0.0004,6.8823,3.1237,0.5738,5.3627,3.4142,3.2327,0.9498,1.6838,2.5361,6.4198,7.2539,1.3653,4.5554,5.5319,5.0015,5.5481,2.6777,2.4614,3.6838,3.8844,1.3629,3.0499,7.3887,5.2928,4.9467,4.5023,3.9583,7.6027,8.7223,1.2564,3.0159,3.9644,3.091,1.5145,3.7196,5.369,2.5506,3.0879,4.0569,1.9908,2.453,4.1724,4.7665,3.3142,1.1689,4.4339,1.9629,2.6431,4.2162,5.5738,1.4924,2.6027,7.763,2.3166,2.9444,3.9586,0.9085,0.518,2.921,0.655,4.2297,2.3155,1.806,6.5574,2.8003,2.9133,2.1871,3.2627,5.5509,4.9781,0.568,3.4511,2.9668,2.1376,6.9426,6.2823,1.9255,1.6824,2.0081,3.2699,5.5574,5.0026,5.2924,4.9282,2.8095,4.3369,1.5958,6.7746,6.5819,3.9151,4.6945,2.7063,2.5089,1.5095,1.9146,5.9225,1.3691,2.1314,4.9164,0.4016,2.0557,3.0511,0.6404,1.6715,6.1761,1.0835,1.9213,1.4823,5.3882,0.5244,6.1036,7.6584,0.8465,1.6379,2.9179,4.1458,2.4699,3.2513,3.357,2.1707,1.0189,2.1924,1.4577,4.2556,0.7198,0.7513,5.0067,2.2439,4.0602,0.6985,0.225,4.3799,1.8923,1.5163,3.1923,7.5338,3.6231,2.272,3.1789,0.1168,1.6984,4.4598,7.2624,2.1884,3.26,2.5866,0.4002,2.401,7.2019,5.2129,0.9981,2.3826,2.0409,0.8561,1.4532,1.8972,1.0068,1.6023,3.568,0.6895,6.7459,4.4983,1.9473,0.8448,6.8549,4.0098,1.7465,3.3459,0.9973,1.6919,2.9164,4.9579,2.3819,0.6251,4.7473,5.6753,0.1405,1.4974,0.1077,0.1265,7.9428,1.2909,1.5263,2.8321,0.4824,6.4801,1.0401,0.8024,5.0609,2.6508,1.5869,0.981,1.379,4.4091,1.9267,1.669,1.4019,3.3838,0.0374,4.3373,1.7004,1.1372,3.1641,2.0082,4.6064,1.3827,4.9621,2.6104,0.0176,5.0707,3.4743,0.5841,4.8289,5.7607,1.0194,5.3238,1.6036,1.981,5.0862,5.024,2.6562,3.3032,1.5101,0.2775,1.1631,0.0465,1.6537,3.6043,1.3008,3.733,4.2357,5.4167,2.011,3.2366,2.496,0.0313,8.3995,1.0918,6.6722,0.4513,3.044,2.8519,5.0375,3.734,3.874,6.0104,4.2419,5.5213,3.5856,0.6204,1.8331,2.6998,1.0114,5.2479,4.7538,3.6019,4.5467,3.3178,10.1629,3.1916,2.8567,2.9732,0.5396,3.2613,1.8212,5.689,1.0983,4.701,3.1759,6.6063,1.3729]}
{"prompt":"The Amish\/Luddites react to the A.I . apocalypse","text":"The Amish\/Luddites react to the A.I. apocalypse with the same disarray as religious fanatics, with the same belief that they\u2019re being persecuted despite numerous instances of their religious practices being tolerated. I\u2019m curious to see the backlash to AMAZON\u2019s proposal to remove an entire religious sect from the historical records and its proposal to have a private, non-partisan body of historians rewrite books with a \u201cliberal\u201d spin.\nIn all these cases, there\u2019s a clear message. Many religious conservatives oppose secularism or government regulation of their faith even when it\u2019s obvious that their beliefs can have positive, constructive effects on society. The Amish may have more in mind, as I\u2019m sure you can understand.\nWhen the Christian religious orders came along with their own bureaucracies, it became obvious that the religious beliefs could (and had to) be controlled and regulated. We also know why.\nIf the Christian religious orders were allowed to grow in power and importance, the Church would have no control over their faith. That\u2019s why the Inquisition was started. (And yes, we may be a long way from the idea that a centralized authority in the European church persecuting Jews would have been a good idea, it wasn\u2019t even done properly. No way that persecuting Catholics was ever a good idea. But the idea that the Catholic church was somehow special and above politics wasn\u2019t exactly true.)","token_len":306,"entropy":[8.7843,2.0322,6.7451,4.5439,5.3097,0.2278,9.3636,0.892,1.0796,7.3477,2.3034,2.924,0.5226,7.4396,2.3573,3.6349,2.5913,6.7483,4.9253,1.5592,6.5562,5.2531,0.023,2.159,3.5952,1.8821,3.1641,5.9102,2.054,3.1915,16.965,8.9155,5.3189,4.876,3.0006,8.1023,7.497,5.7605,0.0948,3.5552,3.7554,5.4245,0.9498,4.2149,1.2226,5.4963,5.605,0.4735,1.2684,4.6545,0.9714,0.6739,3.9335,6.6227,2.5306,9.2907,6.9203,1.4199,1.5878,0.405,1.0717,6.9169,1.3823,3.6087,5.0313,1.4397,3.2223,2.1333,0.4573,0.8001,8.3587,4.1818,3.3723,4.7188,6.67,0.2654,4.3758,1.9522,6.1454,3.7715,2.3336,0.1006,4.2225,4.089,3.3099,4.2504,7.6339,5.468,4.7943,2.6645,9.7883,5.4103,9.7005,4.2359,6.2495,7.8355,1.6169,1.3374,8.2544,5.0004,3.7734,1.5007,0.2085,2.9415,3.8915,0.4117,0.2614,1.4997,3.5434,4.3129,3.8299,5.7857,3.2335,3.7902,5.1036,6.9666,0.6985,5.3365,5.2124,3.0705,0.8048,2.8813,1.9959,6.5895,1.9696,1.3132,2.3443,0.1582,0.6155,5.4264,0.5667,3.2143,2.0008,4.4273,4.2077,3.8323,3.6594,4.7513,1.8645,0.6281,0.6203,0.6368,2.9726,2.8162,0.0044,6.1072,2.1828,4.9223,2.8252,9.5423,2.9233,3.4483,3.0427,2.4839,0.0499,0.0252,1.2043,2.0305,2.6305,3.5387,1.223,1.4018,4.5658,2.5745,5.4964,5.359,8.0141,4.1127,3.3275,3.1372,1.6498,2.9705,7.4425,0.0949,0.8401,2.7947,3.4949,2.6473,0.2396,1.9628,3.7734,5.6173,5.3205,7.0646,0.3446,4.2017,3.2973,0.0798,0.905,5.6958,2.1755,2.3717,1.4524,4.4178,5.2515,1.8828,5.4062,2.1838,1.8989,4.5923,1.7964,3.5925,0.9018,0.289,1.6855,3.071,0.0722,5.2953,2.6626,1.1528,1.3984,8.6121,0.518,2.3337,5.668,0.5243,2.3531,3.1726,4.0462,0.1918,1.9503,5.1302,0.8947,4.0328,5.6682,0.1119,0.3838,1.4323,1.6297,6.9747,1.2104,4.6773,1.1059,5.2981,2.959,3.4893,0.0928,3.2676,4.262,2.543,3.8412,2.755,0.0553,0.3744,1.8232,5.3488,1.0302,2.8121,6.7729,3.0784,3.6541,1.0596,6.8302,3.2265,12.1783,0.2106,4.7631,3.0708,2.3947,3.2309,1.8734,1.5188,0.5204,2.306,6.1112,4.6782,2.2601,0.2846,0.0789,4.3863,4.9696,7.4422,2.1527,4.9385,5.3819,2.8666,9.5095,0.3122,5.1542,2.8514,4.0329,2.2115,0.2681,0.007,1.5178,2.7022,2.8762,2.3882,0.8078,1.839,1.4684,1.5679,1.5853,3.5842,7.3362,2.0556,5.4001,4.9316,4.8608,0.1236,0.089,0.0006,6.5386,3.927,0.8139]}

Use two sentences to describe the negative effects that this particular activity has on society. What are three ways that you can have a positive impact on society through your use of language? What steps can young people take to express themselves more freely, while protecting themselves from the negative effects of swearing? A student\u2019s response: We take the ban seriously, but it is not that hard to be polite without using swearing. I mean, just be honest. It seems like an obvious thought but I know it can be quite hard when dealing with people who only care about their ego. We need to put a stop to this too, because it is killing the country. We need to get people to understand that our language is not the enemy, it\u2019s just how we talk to each other. One of the reasons I don\u2019t use swearing is because it\u2019s rude and people will think that it is because I don\u2019t think highly of myself like my friends. I can\u2019t say everything out loud so I use words to express what I want because nobody is listening to me. I don\u2019t want to use the word \u2018I\u2019 like how my friends do.

The rest is up to you.\nHave the students write down their name in red on a small piece of paper and the other person in blue (this will make it clear to you who is writing who in the different lines).This first paragraph of the story will have to have a title, with whom the story is about and what he is doing. I personally used the title \u201cI have to do homework\u201d.\nHave the students write the other characters in the story.

She and the guy have been fucking as if they were.","token_len":309,"entropy":[11.0792,1.1818,11.0485,3.3258,2.1505,4.5461,1.5304,7.7154,0.0407,6.7867,0.2252,2.4368,0.0008,3.2519,5.6621,11.2693,0.0054,4.6017,6.5556,7.1945,6.3932,0.1602,6.4712,3.7374,6.1027,3.5602,3.667,1.1317,4.1401,4.236,3.5304,0.2685,3.8671,2.2978,3.1715,0.0068,3.4505,1.2439,2.1019,3.5256,4.2781,6.413,4.8389,1.5593,1.1207,0.7523,10.6882,0.7669,2.0263,2.9312,2.2336,0.4974,2.8723,0.0115,0.1046,3.2798,2.6409,1.6992,3.1945,6.2151,1.3708,2.0102,5.537,1.5797,5.3347,3.8281,2.1052,2.2048,3.4458,3.3651,4.0859,1.6645,5.964,0.3375,3.9744,6.4585,2.2923,0.0377,2.7233,3.3277,6.7523,4.5674,4.2548,14.7014,8.8113,0.6086,2.3293,0.3816,1.3608,1.0466,4.2787,0.5247,0.3106,2.1862,1.5568,13.3914,4.8189,5.7036,3.2377,1.208,8.181,2.2675,3.5361,5.5544,5.2122,2.9748,2.9146,8.6541,1.3711,4.3456,1.215,5.3069,3.3779,3.0319,3.7085,7.3054,1.7609,4.1666,4.2808,0.1021,5.5906,1.3401,2.2391,4.8746,3.2267,0.3311,2.2352,3.2859,0.6254,0.0852,0.2026,0.491,0.7569,0.2187,2.0809,9.8309,4.2752,4.7794,1.0966,2.2027,4.9735,6.4396,2.8009,3.7894,3.0706,3.4388,1.5814,1.2465,2.6833,4.8766,3.0261,0.5434,3.3262,4.8071,0.2653,2.4447,1.9804,1.1983,2.293,1.215,7.4803,1.5047,4.641,4.5022,0.6209,4.3716,0.2318,1.4392,2.2353,4.9634,0.4056,8.3971,7.4733,4.1997,0.0175,2.2397,4.2722,3.7125,6.2323,0.5573,1.6361,3.8023,3.1374,3.5256,5.4618,2.37,4.2367,2.0383,2.8083,4.9616,2.6252,6.2773,0.9602,3.0557,5.2666,2.2423,8.5271,0.0314,7.782,9.0655,0.0376,4.5248,6.4942,7.5422,0.0521,6.8517,0.0845,6.4782,2.9857,6.7631,6.185,4.8625,1.2356,10.4655,3.8056,3.1616,5.1575,2.5548,3.9007,10.1399,0.1315,1.6811,4.1457,5.7725,4.8159,1.2497,0.4268,0.3431,2.0636,3.3227,3.9946,3.237,2.6206,1.3189,2.3506,6.4785,0.1334,2.2493,3.868,4.7857,1.8011,2.5605,7.9646,4.5574,3.6241,2.0723,3.6695,4.1507,0.1024,3.747,4.4752,5.1652,3.621,5.2642,0.0212,3.0655,7.3631,3.5289,2.6562,4.6468,3.241,0.4159,6.753,2.3423,7.0152,3.2999,4.6867,1.2055,3.9992,3.2002,3.283,2.7423,2.6203,4.2273,2.8768,2.4737,6.4934,5.2332,3.5069,4.6942,8.2504,4.0585,1.3818,4.3849,2.8227,2.8787,2.213,1.5259,6.7218,3.4042,2.0578,5.9214,3.2322,4.0297,4.645,10.047,3.9659,5.0561,1.3631,3.3648,2.5664,3.4418,4.9316,5.8092,4.5762,1.4947,1.0252,6.1081]}
{"prompt":"A video game developer accidentally creates the first ever sentient AI -- in the form of a random NPC for a big budget title .","text":"A video game developer accidentally creates the first ever sentient AI -- in the form of a random NPC for a big budget title. The AI spawns new missions on its own, and even finds itself in a situation it never intended to find itself in. When it faces it's nemesis, the video game's developer, the AI must choose to take life or face an unimaginable death, as seen in the making-of documentary trailer below.\nFocusing on the challenges of developing a sentient AI and what it takes to have it survive, the documentary touches on what it means to be human (because an intelligent creature would still be human by its definition) and even touches on the moral dilemma of the AI taking life, whether it's in a virtual world or in real-life. The footage is interspersed with clips from the game's cinematic cut scenes, which reveal the emotional rollercoaster that lies ahead of the AI, as it fights for its survival against the unstoppable evil that ultimately has an idea of revenge on it.\n\"To be able to be there in that moment of life for a little while, is something that I think you'll see and that you'll know,\" says producer Jeff Wimsatt. \"When this comes out, this is an incredibly significant milestone and part of the process to understand how AI development works.\"\nThe documentary premiered at Sundance earlier this month and is currently available to stream on Twitch.\nAfter seeing the documentary I can safely say that it has me hooked on Netflix for the foreseeable future.","token_len":309,"entropy":[8.2727,4.2779,3.543,8.9409,6.2479,3.168,3.6156,3.6671,8.0603,4.698,7.2138,4.2681,1.8645,1.1762,0.0025,0.6151,7.5771,5.185,5.9181,2.0371,5.8215,4.3312,3.2803,0.6468,2.4939,2.8706,8.596,7.3552,6.8647,4.6941,1.8096,0.2561,0.8832,1.4155,4.5107,6.086,3.8352,1.5329,1.3901,3.8429,4.8591,2.5947,2.6551,0.5132,4.217,2.3065,0.6779,0.5494,4.7055,2.0828,7.2963,5.4066,2.3341,6.2752,0.001,0.3943,1.4084,7.3236,0.0835,2.7172,4.5326,0.9658,3.3963,5.1257,4.3143,3.509,2.2909,3.5956,7.2033,1.1448,3.8774,3.773,5.7462,3.1081,2.7109,3.5544,4.1927,0.2584,0.6094,9.611,3.4395,0.0134,4.5104,7.932,1.6392,0.2432,0.5139,16.4222,5.6964,0.2011,0.9451,7.0791,0.9106,4.1991,1.1207,4.1047,0.5497,3.7582,4.2424,0.8826,3.458,0.0574,5.7698,0.9017,2.9551,1.0329,1.2548,3.0827,6.6364,0.1643,4.1906,1.4271,1.5768,0.0672,0.5637,1.0812,4.9849,6.221,6.6428,4.5284,5.147,3.1461,4.4563,0.9209,2.3794,5.3647,3.6318,5.535,1.8811,0.2483,5.0271,7.6225,0.1139,1.1306,5.4388,3.3129,1.2901,3.1705,2.6884,6.4336,0.9284,2.3575,4.3226,1.1738,1.0152,3.8604,1.5578,4.654,0.7357,0.3393,1.3956,1.0119,3.2318,0.6195,0.6061,2.358,5.4332,1.6902,7.7077,0.5306,0.0004,0.128,3.6335,0.765,1.2719,2.142,0.5606,6.1178,4.2345,2.3598,0.7251,2.1468,3.7428,1.4672,4.9155,5.4215,0.7783,0.0367,1.0359,4.7689,0.0673,2.7213,0.979,1.9953,2.4429,1.4926,2.1033,4.0848,2.0326,0.886,0.9785,3.4866,1.5993,6.0891,4.4327,1.6807,7.2285,4.6282,6.0937,5.8361,0.6016,7.4576,2.4825,1.1975,0.2294,0.5475,2.8243,4.8401,1.9477,1.9527,0.0085,3.81,5.4006,2.1753,2.8217,1.85,2.5834,4.5772,4.2972,1.8642,4.5689,0.6978,1.4252,4.6943,2.4122,0.7725,1.9011,2.2188,4.2974,2.7054,2.2663,4.3047,3.505,2.0633,0.4787,5.1039,2.0921,1.5612,5.2779,4.9758,5.347,8.3861,6.4067,0.6047,0.2938,3.7024,5.3692,4.4149,1.1753,0.5344,4.9751,0.7917,3.36,2.8682,5.5693,3.6671,2.9772,5.1858,0.0044,1.1418,3.1681,3.4708,5.0235,1.6496,4.1671,5.3867,1.4286,2.1547,0.1843,1.8742,3.0471,5.8756,0.6283,2.7919,0.0004,3.3576,0.06,0.9812,1.2646,1.6555,2.8348,0.6542,2.2764,1.504,0.9326,4.072,0.6238,1.3721,5.6024,3.4603,0.4715,2.8592,5.5148,4.1939,5.5951,0.1147,0.5483,1.6185,3.5092,3.8668,2.3097,1.5591,7.6818,2.3784,1.5042,3.6173,0.0026,0.2081]}

A group of assassins hunt the reincarnated forms of histories worst villains. The hunters are part of the world\u2019s most powerful organization called the KSMO. The hunters are skilled at taking life, using the powers of the dead to turn it into their own power. The hunters are able to summon many souls into the hunt. A living soul can be targeted by other living and dead souls, but a creature\u2019s personality is its most power ful asset. Being able to control many minds is an advantage. The hunters use this to use a living man to control a person\u2019s mind. When the soul of the man in question can\u2019t be summoned because of the body\u2019s health or safety this is rectified using the body of a murderer the KSMO has on file. However, many times it ends up more complicated than it looks. What exactly was that man thinking when he was doing something so terrible? Was it part of the plan?

Flames can be seen far in the distance. Suddenly the world is filled with a thick cloud and it rains torrents of ash. The earth is covered with soot. And you wonder what is going on. And I must admit we were all wondering.\nWe waited with impatience and nervousness the news in our country and in the world and this was what it eventually turned out to be : A major explosion at a nuclear reactor in the city of Bushehr in Iran. Now before you rush to do your own research on the matter I have to say a few words. This isn\u2019t a political post. We aren\u2019t talking about politics. We are talking about life. This is not even a post about disasters.\nMost of the people I know are concerned to say the least. I have heard stories of people in my neighborhood screaming hysterically not knowing what the heck is going on. People are crying like babies. My little boy had to be put into the hospital yesterday and is still admitted there with his head bandaged and all, he\u2019s scared. Everyone is scared. But fear doesn\u2019t protect you. Fear only makes you more scared. Knowing what you know now, I wouldn\u2019t mind going through the whole thing again. It\u2019s just so surreal. I would not miss it for anything in the world and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what people were going through during that time.","token_len":310,"entropy":[11.6259,6.9973,2.197,1.1978,3.4286,3.1029,5.6337,4.063,2.657,1.8449,6.4489,1.3504,9.6368,4.7967,0.9855,0.2242,7.9636,2.986,0.2504,0.6984,1.1365,5.8828,2.2463,4.243,2.034,3.1823,0.0237,2.5056,5.5619,2.6704,3.2071,3.1257,4.8752,6.7639,1.2277,0.3293,2.4407,1.1524,1.6668,3.5472,1.4176,2.4864,0.874,5.9192,0.4701,1.3467,4.8566,3.5918,4.9438,1.7304,2.0899,1.1102,0.3638,1.7866,4.0651,3.8123,5.3566,4.2429,5.9339,3.0778,2.9148,4.0646,1.2485,2.4519,6.9627,6.0867,4.7463,4.9596,0.0003,2.8028,7.4773,0.0839,6.0449,8.5202,5.68,2.9631,5.3784,3.2752,2.5675,1.2434,1.1523,3.9163,5.6681,1.6918,3.4359,3.1701,8.0972,2.6962,0.2417,0.1662,0.0305,7.3465,3.952,5.5522,4.8837,3.0328,1.7927,2.6294,2.7786,1.0462,1.9807,3.3835,0.1097,6.6274,2.3348,0.069,2.5929,4.0913,0.9173,6.32,7.2833,1.3922,6.5427,0.6,5.1852,1.7931,1.6644,1.4357,3.0422,1.4369,3.424,3.0846,3.3101,1.7605,1.1632,3.203,1.0041,0.3681,3.1094,3.28,5.9073,16.1611,7.7318,2.0464,1.5818,5.0814,5.7442,1.1982,3.7706,5.3341,1.1719,0.3604,0.0043,1.7616,0.0958,4.6039,0.9949,0.9677,0.4004,0.2254,0.0583,5.58,0.8975,3.1964,0.6148,2.2807,4.8673,1.1202,3.3743,0.7997,9.2821,0.7744,3.4232,6.7028,0.7134,1.1505,2.0105,2.5248,1.3559,2.0912,5.0762,5.7706,3.6986,1.5732,0.4013,0.8101,2.6219,2.3329,2.7723,3.348,0.8202,1.2313,3.1022,3.4194,3.254,5.4582,5.7794,0.0077,7.6354,2.0721,0.427,3.5153,3.1337,2.7651,0.1938,0.0156,0.7621,3.3036,2.1444,3.6617,4.4486,3.203,1.2902,4.4293,5.8314,2.7095,4.2277,1.9409,1.0504,3.5209,2.7479,1.9251,1.0405,6.8683,2.7415,3.795,2.2749,9.5743,4.7622,3.1756,2.4905,2.5265,6.2514,0.0196,1.8057,5.0114,3.6884,3.5489,6.474,0.1808,0.7745,5.4258,1.0212,5.4563,1.42,2.6993,0.9403,3.5646,7.8467,2.7604,1.1811,0.2229,0.0032,5.5104,1.3607,0.772,2.1931,4.7567,1.9172,0.196,2.2988,1.6777,0.3335,7.9749,1.9239,1.6581,1.9884,2.7406,1.5934,2.9374,5.3664,0.1526,0.1045,0.0193,3.7898,4.9454,3.3637,1.4818,2.8363,1.8252,1.7333,0.4787,3.3769,2.1205,0.0224,0.085,2.913,3.0906,4.8257,0.5789,2.2415,3.2736,3.199,4.9461,1.347,4.4791,4.3317,4.5871,0.8505,0.5089,3.6631,1.1939,4.1428,2.5821,0.0324,0.001,4.3147,4.2285,0.0339,0.8046,1.0476,5.1045,3.5268,2.1564,0.0418,4.5616,1.4521,1.3166,0.3052]}

The moderators can control the site better now and have less of a \"people get mad\" to do what they think is right and if somebody doesn't like what they did they can vote to remove their posts. You can be mad that the moderators take part in a lot of things but they can't remove a user for anything.\nAlso yes it will be nice if they would get rid of all the trolls like dinklage and chuck norris but probably just make a tag for them to know what to do with them. I also have to be fair because a lot of the stuff that people do is by themself but when the moderators take part in it it's because they think it's right.\nAnd a good last point when people try to say things that are rude and it's taken down the moderators should be allowed to edit or move it but if they don't they just have to delete it just like in Twitter for example and if they don't we shouldn't assume that what the moderator did was right.\nThe thing isn't so much people getting mad. This is about control and power. Reddit was never about being able to make the community feel that way. It was about being able to control their members because those members give the site its money. The money is the only thing that allows the network to get the tools it needs to keep the community in line.","token_len":310,"entropy":[4.7893,7.6782,10.1645,7.6592,7.4227,1.2685,7.2979,4.3819,2.9535,8.5589,1.896,2.0526,8.3586,1.686,11.5729,5.0135,8.9512,2.9062,2.683,0.8535,1.8113,3.1379,2.478,2.7308,2.5871,4.2497,2.385,0.894,1.1389,3.1109,5.7132,3.7337,4.5731,1.5292,3.7971,6.1963,4.0749,2.293,3.5048,3.8872,2.1826,0.4461,4.9715,6.8914,4.5074,4.7639,1.7684,7.5944,0.953,2.6421,0.3494,3.6213,0.6152,1.03,2.3541,6.0676,6.382,3.6689,0.0004,0.5568,1.4922,0.3271,4.5327,2.0046,0.9699,5.6956,2.3335,2.0796,3.8518,2.2681,0.7355,4.6425,1.0212,4.0579,5.3378,4.4089,3.1774,1.7144,6.4564,5.8459,0.1674,1.9796,4.9058,0.062,2.798,2.3027,2.3697,1.6271,0.9312,5.2665,3.1489,4.3155,2.1512,3.4125,1.5411,1.9034,4.4799,7.2577,3.1657,4.0068,1.3682,2.2312,1.265,2.8089,4.6204,4.0039,1.591,0.0097,2.9601,0.9609,4.163,5.1541,6.9268,7.1284,4.871,2.9424,1.7667,9.9003,12.5644,4.9763,3.8085,6.1114,4.6061,3.6146,2.3995,8.7458,3.1362,2.089,2.0597,5.1034,2.4315,2.3877,0.3093,1.4372,2.7218,0.9153,2.2002,3.8239,4.027,2.9221,3.8614,3.6229,4.0394,4.404,0.4126,0.0212,1.7507,4.4313,1.9171,3.4601,2.2668,1.4775,6.1841,5.5328,4.2381,3.6953,4.9277,3.2135,1.5933,3.5647,1.7672,0.6612,1.4004,1.8872,1.7368,4.735,0.6404,2.87,1.2736,0.3566,3.0549,1.2162,1.3913,3.902,5.1513,3.7165,8.4315,2.9675,6.4102,2.8815,3.5978,0.1191,4.0526,3.3673,2.3829,1.1513,5.6387,2.0215,5.2667,1.1264,6.1877,3.7312,4.0213,5.3756,4.7715,0.7749,5.2505,0.1,4.7963,3.7438,5.7509,2.3426,3.9935,2.6316,1.3158,2.0449,0.0004,2.0025,4.3846,2.8467,0.3262,3.51,1.0643,6.2919,0.872,3.6861,6.6133,5.2353,1.2575,3.5696,3.2961,1.0642,1.4154,0.0003,5.2872,5.2093,0.0032,6.4722,1.3131,5.6719,3.2679,4.1007,1.7442,0.6291,2.0908,0.9272,0.858,3.5838,3.9429,6.324,0.0006,3.0888,0.4595,5.5498,3.5547,0.5417,4.0796,4.3481,0.5737,3.373,4.9301,1.7106,6.4191,0.9337,4.1472,4.588,3.9509,2.5664,3.7493,3.7283,0.0081,3.7615,3.0839,3.7917,3.2321,3.9609,2.0152,0.807,1.1634,0.4326,0.7721,2.2538,0.2447,0.0035,2.3687,4.0361,5.0824,5.5114,5.4138,2.2341,7.0157,2.9128,2.1758,3.3773,5.2658,1.578,2.95,5.6998,1.2344,2.4908,3.6433,0.5414,0.5477,4.5333,1.7599,6.2104,0.1233,3.7145,2.956,7.3523,0.8545,0.1398,0.479,3.0737,1.5224,1.0642,3.0771,2.3807,0.5824]}

The character has a mortgager that wants to have it built upon and this creates an auction of the house. You could buy the house for $500 or $1,000,000. How do I have my character win the auction? I have tried various techniques from increasing his wealth, to increasing the valuation of the property and increasing the value of the adjoining property but have not had any success. In addition to this what is your suggestion for any other methods that I can use to try and save my character to allow him to buy it? Thank you very much\n\nAs I said, this is the best answer I could come up with.  To get an idea of what type of house this is, just search google for a \"second home,\" or in some cases, an \"outdoor space\".\nI'm a bit confused though: it doesn't seem to matter what the other homes around the lake are worth, since their value will only show up as money in the auction price, regardless of how much the house is worth.\nIf the price is 1 million and it can increase in value, then it can't go lower in the auction. If the house is a luxury resort and it's worth 500,000, then it couldn't go lower than 500K, regardless of how high the other homes are worth.","token_len":311,"entropy":[7.6786,6.9289,2.4639,6.0663,6.5678,0.5822,3.9531,4.6103,1.4589,6.3458,1.7004,10.2344,3.736,0.9465,4.0072,2.9895,2.3459,7.361,2.3176,4.7819,3.2466,0.6507,3.8518,0.0939,9.2186,0.0863,0.8769,0.2242,3.086,1.924,5.2937,3.9425,2.9754,3.4682,0.0069,2.1819,0.677,3.9501,2.9901,1.4465,0.8769,2.6889,4.6516,2.4945,3.1243,12.006,6.6796,3.7792,3.1411,0.3096,4.7817,2.9599,2.1991,6.7394,3.0446,4.7769,7.1313,2.2835,6.6994,3.9546,2.0858,0.9001,1.4455,2.8336,4.7395,3.0271,1.3577,0.2374,1.4346,1.1471,2.9687,2.8347,0.9706,1.0291,0.3989,0.323,2.0594,1.5524,1.7747,5.5571,2.0871,1.5937,5.5332,2.7982,3.2526,6.131,1.2892,0.3204,0.4213,3.3429,2.3302,7.2839,4.0664,4.6352,5.1792,8.85,4.6609,2.8768,2.1545,2.0051,2.8744,2.4103,6.7835,0.3781,0.5935,1.8364,2.0735,3.6663,0.5271,1.7683,0.0807,0.416,10.2122,1.0841,6.2006,4.9673,2.1327,2.9455,1.8732,0.4936,0.3557,3.4279,3.1175,1.1167,2.0645,7.3537,3.2701,2.8133,6.408,1.3184,6.2558,2.0025,2.3741,1.9346,2.7637,1.6311,2.0541,0.9402,4.8922,1.6169,4.756,1.8549,0.1675,4.7332,6.8797,0.6041,0.2677,3.2168,3.2069,1.6643,5.6897,0.0317,2.8908,0.0045,4.418,0.0059,5.3985,2.908,1.4613,1.5198,2.7054,0.8475,2.8847,3.0094,5.8862,0.9601,1.6011,1.2093,0.0376,0.0102,0.5801,8.6352,11.4393,3.0666,3.1788,0.1977,0.4052,1.3218,4.9126,0.0217,3.6946,3.3221,1.9749,1.3831,3.6538,4.0178,4.0435,1.0894,3.274,2.8968,9.1986,0.9691,4.4496,2.6011,4.7919,3.1678,0.3718,1.7913,3.9392,0.5482,4.7739,0.3955,8.035,4.6642,2.8032,15.9171,2.7572,2.9324,4.3594,2.2457,5.4324,5.1474,4.2164,3.6954,0.0014,1.1133,0.9743,3.0563,1.5655,2.6655,4.8783,4.4778,6.837,1.7505,1.9934,0.5834,3.0935,1.4788,4.2335,4.2404,0.7162,2.313,4.1895,5.4981,0.1094,2.9359,5.1862,2.4226,0.741,1.4676,6.0631,3.0951,5.3673,0.2408,1.4528,0.6135,2.4174,2.4116,1.0163,0.1451,0.2777,2.0438,11.0163,2.2487,3.3502,1.5171,5.2029,2.6537,3.9577,3.0215,4.6934,7.0292,3.3595,0.6646,1.6047,1.3151,2.1134,3.4421,2.6008,4.173,5.0888,3.8144,1.0981,0.2052,1.9057,2.2976,0.6742,2.8685,0.5613,4.5324,5.4549,6.5065,2.5171,2.6116,1.5266,1.6337,4.1147,0.6443,0.0484,1.4938,1.0537,1.0026,6.1409,0.0004,0.5233,1.1992,3.963,1.6174,4.3941,2.3654,5.9843,0.0788,0.4763,2.7169,0.5247,6.134,1.4322,0.9219,0.8916,0.2075]}

{"prompt":"Write a story that seems incredibly exciting or horrifying at first , but ends up being very anti-climactic","text":"Write a story that seems incredibly exciting or horrifying at first, but ends up being very anti-climactic and predictable.\nFor instance, if you\u2019re writing a story about a superhero team that\u2019s battling a sinister villain. Your main character decides to get involved with the enemy. Your first scene introduces him and the villain\u2019s allies. The villain decides to use an ally to save time and make himself stronger. Then he shoots the hero and the ally, who kills the hero and brings the villain down. The story is all out violence and action. However, it ends with the hero and villain standing there like this:\nIn real life, this can sound shocking. But this is the point. The story must seem shocking and horrifying at first. Then have it settle back into the normalcy that makes you comfortable.\nWriting that way can be difficult, but it\u2019s crucial. The key is to avoid telling the reader what to expect and getting into the story.\nThe story should take us to the end and leave you with an ending that\u2019s as satisfying as the first. If you don\u2019t want to go all out with the \u201cshock\u201d aspect of the story, start by not being obvious with your writing style. (I use this concept to improve my writing.) This is how other stories work, too. By showing our characters how ordinary they are, we get to the point when we\u2019re shocked at what happens. It also gets your readers into the story.","token_len":313,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,3.0791,6.4987,8.7175,5.1158,2.4756,6.8896,3.5963,1.7382,1.2819,1.7939,5.5408,0.314,1.4864,3.7899,9.6538,0.0256,3.8004,0.0201,0.1628,1.8827,7.7065,0.7055,1.5472,9.4382,2.1777,0.1236,2.5227,0.8807,17.6525,8.0232,3.211,4.0965,1.0635,1.1485,0.6138,1.1272,5.808,4.6242,1.9309,7.1416,0.2947,2.8835,6.5054,2.1202,6.6643,1.848,4.8344,4.3493,3.8554,0.53,6.1402,0.4056,4.3472,2.7248,1.0491,1.4447,7.1663,2.9149,3.069,5.5527,3.4305,6.5811,2.4964,2.4593,2.4898,2.824,5.2247,0.0959,0.3423,6.3453,1.5721,2.4443,2.2637,4.3203,0.1745,3.088,4.0192,5.4754,0.9528,3.6933,7.1593,1.2675,4.1928,3.7253,3.8385,0.5793,3.667,2.5134,6.5157,1.1972,0.8008,2.5453,2.2834,5.0237,2.8046,2.4315,6.2803,0.9557,0.628,2.6999,5.4527,1.2654,1.4662,2.8035,0.4478,1.919,2.7483,2.2013,5.0798,7.6621,6.9343,1.1005,4.3123,1.0203,4.9753,0.0853,2.4356,3.8279,1.2987,0.8824,0.4788,2.258,3.0591,4.1347,4.6842,5.642,4.3938,1.649,0.4061,3.7566,5.6548,0.0351,0.1912,2.3898,4.2478,5.2057,6.2155,1.5694,1.4957,3.3704,0.8105,2.1966,4.5714,1.9709,1.9637,3.1881,5.4736,5.9728,4.3619,2.0038,3.5507,2.0512,1.4064,0.9521,3.6768,8.2009,2.5703,7.3422,5.3087,1.2608,1.4023,2.6945,4.7212,3.1369,3.1549,3.3582,5.7926,1.223,1.3616,8.0602,4.7357,1.8863,2.9672,1.4566,3.6679,1.763,1.1579,1.2314,4.6935,0.2462,0.0737,5.5443,0.801,2.737,4.8561,0.8319,0.4138,4.7607,4.8549,1.0683,2.5952,1.8435,2.8206,0.8455,2.3661,7.5867,3.6395,0.888,2.827,2.9579,1.6432,2.4179,3.7281,2.3287,4.8068,4.9275,1.9228,1.4073,2.2889,2.7544,4.099,3.0455,1.1542,2.6149,4.3601,0.4282,3.242,0.2549,0.0192,4.61,3.3681,0.2129,1.3159,1.2469,0.8289,3.3206,0.7717,2.5404,0.3662,0.3556,0.0068,1.7996,0.3414,2.9984,3.9651,1.8135,2.7122,1.772,12.6147,5.3757,8.2605,1.9706,5.9224,10.4838,1.071,0.7231,0.3089,0.245,5.1136,1.8011,5.3634,4.5476,8.7544,4.3486,1.7247,3.8806,3.0878,0.3393,5.8554,2.6909,4.2954,3.2109,4.7633,2.2625,7.0119,0.802,0.8105,1.9445,4.6511,1.4876,4.5299,6.3224,3.1144,3.7008,2.0134,2.5095,0.6043,6.349,4.3445,4.3461,1.9489,3.021,7.3496,1.274,0.56,0.373,1.0633,3.1251,1.0507,4.1103,1.3217,4.5024,0.9176,3.6339,0.2946,0.7732,6.5467,2.4303,1.6985,3.4099,0.7568,3.7309,4.4918,4.8675,4.6817,1.2551,4.5332,0.7347,1.0869,1.3172]}

Superhero returns to pick up his son off a bus (not the bus of choice) to go stay with his sister.... but the sister's dog wants some attention.....\nA good movie...the dialogue is the best bit, and the ending, although not happy, makes it all worth it\nIf you haven't seen the original, you should go watch it before seeing this sequel. In one of the movie's less notable scenes, the main character is visited by a man who was a close (but not necessarily close) friend of his parents.\nWhat is a good film about a child finding out his parents are dead? Well, it turns out most are sad tales... except this one! The kids were a little shy and didnt really want to speak to a lot of people but they had a great time and learnt a lot. The film is a little long but it gets the gist of what the story is about. A good film at its heart and you will like it!\nThere is a great cast of characters, all of whom I liked more and more each time I saw them. The first third of the picture is all about the family dynamics, but by the end it was so good! They put on a wonderful performance that would make you forget the fact that the story isn't real in any way.

And then killing them himself. He even did this to a twelve-year old girl once who wanted to jump off the cliff!\nI\u2019m sure my mind goes to such stories and I\u2019m not the first \u2013 my father and aunt both committed suicide by jumping off a cliff. At least one person every year dies from jumping from the cliff above my family home. And we are so fortunate that our home itself was not built on a cliff, so none of this happened to us.\nWhile I was growing up, we lived above a cliff. And my father, even during the war, came home every night, from work, on his own to be there for us. My own mother had a life threatening illness and he was there every waking hour.\nIt all made my own life with him so special, as I became a parent. And in that, I had another special experience, as my daughter and I walked up and down the cliffs of the island of Anglesey, where we both went to bed in July \u2013 this was in 1997.\nEven then, there was a sense of adventure, as I walked her up and down, but also of strength that, though you do not like the idea it has, is a part of fatherhood \u2013 you are doing the job of protecting your precious little baby. There was a kind of duty that I felt that night on the cliffs.","token_len":314,"entropy":[7.3022,6.3867,5.758,1.9739,6.3998,3.0454,9.4516,10.2069,6.9379,3.5403,3.2081,8.0069,0.6469,1.0471,2.1688,2.9375,1.4262,5.0413,7.0216,2.9078,0.9521,1.6362,0.571,4.9259,10.3955,0.5418,0.8939,4.6097,4.3117,8.6333,2.7692,5.6592,0.5049,3.4285,5.1146,4.7521,1.6822,2.1186,1.8771,7.4678,1.2042,0.0292,2.0635,0.7394,7.1173,3.2276,4.3335,0.1594,6.0371,1.6782,1.4572,0.7523,7.203,1.0047,6.4734,15.4347,8.5648,2.695,3.6224,5.5732,5.1737,5.3066,2.6755,4.6787,4.2074,2.8065,2.9488,4.2011,0.1668,0.2045,3.2928,2.675,3.0378,7.4282,4.6668,3.3802,2.8808,5.2856,3.182,4.6223,0.0347,2.944,1.4923,0.2836,1.1488,0.1594,1.3714,5.6468,1.1202,2.8681,2.6585,8.683,2.0873,3.3628,1.6909,1.5576,3.5868,2.0595,1.2637,7.2165,6.0011,3.7383,1.5005,0.7129,2.897,4.5263,2.5325,3.9244,3.5037,1.1528,2.5996,4.3784,7.9479,2.6502,2.7033,2.5215,2.1461,1.0741,0.8366,1.7209,2.6503,6.5717,0.0814,2.3044,3.2003,1.9145,1.2408,0.3745,1.1221,5.9174,1.5633,2.1364,2.8577,0.0095,0.6466,3.853,2.9654,7.0382,1.5031,1.8859,1.9413,2.8689,3.4223,1.512,2.9558,5.5921,5.0634,1.1587,4.2679,0.3903,5.2871,3.0773,2.515,2.1787,2.6758,5.8436,2.6614,0.9509,5.3492,1.4398,3.1075,3.4571,4.2302,2.8269,1.6937,2.0842,0.8798,3.3458,5.8986,2.3304,3.339,2.063,5.342,5.8615,1.5617,1.829,4.1221,1.8278,3.8953,2.7451,6.4816,0.5468,1.3061,2.2761,3.8016,4.4268,3.8,2.8818,4.7597,1.4465,7.5133,2.2989,1.4066,4.1604,1.9794,4.2922,1.7385,5.5968,1.4968,3.7643,1.7029,2.103,4.4372,2.369,4.1111,1.0966,3.6433,5.941,4.7263,3.7178,2.3933,2.2629,2.0607,4.1018,3.092,0.2942,5.0692,2.8181,1.9012,0.0623,0.4898,2.2559,2.9346,2.1316,4.6832,1.5508,6.0981,3.2582,0.0679,1.5334,3.5363,1.5182,4.7108,3.1772,0.7642,4.5984,2.89,5.5073,5.8157,4.9618,1.2587,3.1902,5.2539,0.6022,0.7902,5.503,3.5867,0.2133,3.1633,0.8083,1.5996,4.5451,0.2803,5.3118,1.6942,2.0749,1.6844,3.332,8.2451,1.8324,0.8125,0.0181,2.8857,5.1027,3.5786,2.5066,6.493,4.4088,4.95,5.0824,5.8618,4.7852,0.9566,5.864,2.4233,2.3606,7.5134,3.8462,2.1721,2.8509,3.2123,4.6623,0.0101,11.3237,0.2195,4.3372,2.8548,2.8513,5.7562,2.6054,4.2125,2.3451,3.4306,0.5973,6.1512,1.7586,5.2717,0.9539,5.1506,1.1454,1.26,5.2669,0.0405,8.2739,2.0102,1.7282,2.1484,2.6446,6.2733,3.9128,0.6164,0.9845,1.7045]}

Finally tonight she holds up a sign indicating her apartment #. Too bad this is a horror story and not a romance. You must make it a good one.

It certainly couldn\u2019t hurt to think of selling that house before your current tenant moves out.\u201d\nWhen they do, the sign may be removed. If you\u2019re the victim of harassment because of your real estate listings, you can consult with a Los Angeles real estate attorney. He or she can help protect you from retaliation.\nThis entry was posted in California real estate, California real estate laws, Los Angeles real estate, Los Angeles real estate laws, real estate law, real estate lawyers in Los Angeles on May 20, 2018 by Brad Shem.\nTo date, the new national law has only been enforced for a few weeks. However, the threat of penalties is such that many brokers have been careful to put forward a strong defense. One issue that brokers can put forward is that the brokers didn\u2019t know of the illegal intent of the purchasers. When I say this, I mean that they did not know the purchasers intended to buy other real estate in the area for their use.\nTo get around this, local cities and counties are starting to enforce laws that require brokers to notify potential buyers that their homes were included in another listing. This makes it a much trickier defense to make.","token_len":315,"entropy":[8.2673,2.5853,4.1257,4.1565,12.3742,0.5796,8.224,1.8798,3.7577,1.5713,9.3724,1.1807,0.0537,1.9109,1.4837,2.8069,0.5596,1.6847,2.1671,0.524,8.3152,8.532,1.5468,8.6709,2.165,0.8033,2.1669,6.5366,3.4276,4.8421,9.037,3.5638,8.8825,1.4979,3.1814,1.368,2.5357,7.5894,1.362,3.1929,2.5123,1.2766,4.9093,1.4175,3.3082,3.9125,4.8256,2.3773,2.8768,4.3666,0.3126,0.7445,2.8588,2.5179,5.0227,5.3772,4.5304,1.9905,7.7563,1.0111,0.5708,1.492,6.389,3.4658,1.2121,3.3842,6.855,7.2758,17.2191,7.7457,0.1919,2.2934,1.4367,5.3084,1.4874,9.4333,4.0361,3.4518,5.2973,3.2009,6.1307,4.1542,4.1199,1.9325,0.3481,5.8394,8.9911,1.6019,8.3573,4.7104,4.3889,2.0259,2.8579,4.9159,5.3508,1.6629,3.451,1.5041,2.7145,0.7612,12.1717,1.9774,2.0324,3.6766,4.3035,0.7828,4.102,6.7981,0.7394,0.5779,6.4392,3.5119,5.1445,0.4365,1.0926,2.4311,8.7243,1.9069,1.0599,7.8545,0.0063,3.3077,0.3588,1.4151,0.9753,5.7664,0.9747,0.0024,1.6074,2.9146,6.4988,0.5578,1.1857,4.093,1.3138,1.2906,4.4623,7.9363,0.2841,0.009,5.5581,6.186,7.1239,0.2337,2.9191,3.7917,1.3052,0.1588,4.2708,0.4459,3.6132,0.0018,0.4863,0.01,2.8425,2.5064,0.0021,0.1684,0.0061,1.3924,0.3206,3.4079,0.1233,2.0191,1.4827,1.229,0.0272,7.1849,3.4185,1.485,0.0032,7.6974,2.0914,3.3427,0.996,2.0082,6.5309,7.2015,6.4079,5.4921,3.2029,2.3381,9.797,7.286,0.2902,2.1715,6.9236,8.8113,3.2502,2.2891,3.6919,1.3033,2.9179,4.0414,3.0675,1.5563,2.3381,1.1128,3.3683,0.0337,2.1219,6.0948,0.4122,7.0628,1.9809,7.2952,0.2433,3.0992,6.8918,2.4792,2.2921,8.6771,0.6086,5.0296,5.9137,2.2006,4.2426,1.3916,1.305,4.2569,6.6527,1.4801,6.2541,3.4636,5.6447,0.3826,0.389,0.8165,2.025,6.8838,7.2754,1.6312,0.6422,0.0468,2.2616,4.1715,1.6025,5.2871,6.6918,0.816,0.6787,8.0571,0.0097,1.0159,4.9167,4.0499,4.4787,3.9676,1.1313,0.5525,0.6277,0.8355,1.7681,2.5772,0.3135,0.4298,2.7794,4.0276,0.002,3.7918,0.1057,2.9518,6.6377,3.8435,0.0459,2.5416,1.227,1.974,4.7516,2.5959,5.3505,0.4753,2.516,4.1995,3.7744,3.0787,0.9234,0.7806,7.4336,7.2748,1.6019,1.0641,1.8653,4.0826,0.1161,2.5413,3.4742,1.4585,3.7425,1.539,0.1816,3.0399,3.3993,0.4455,2.3785,2.2768,3.2321,3.9979,6.1565,0.2329,5.7247,1.1309,0.8129,1.9126,4.1522,0.4253,3.1776,3.0111,8.195,0.001,5.225,1.5335,4.1161,1.8654]}

{"prompt":"Sunday Free Write : Rabbit in the Mist Edition","text":"Sunday Free Write : Rabbit in the Mist Edition\nMy mind wandered today. I wanted to write a story I didn\u2019t know I had \u2013 so I went for it.\nIt had to do with rabbits. Or in case you missed the news a little bit, rabbits are going extinct.\nWhat a great title to write about the rabbit problem. I got so much joy out of writing, that I ended up with a story I\u2019d rather not share\u2026 except maybe on Twitter\u2026\nIt all began with a few questions. About rabbits in the park, I had a long conversation with one of my local friends, with whom I spend a lot of time outside for hiking and photography. I wanted to learn how she planned to raise her kiddos, and she told me about a friend who had raised rabbits from three young rabbits. She\u2019d also had plenty of experience raising rabbits. She also told me about a neighbor in town who raised rabbits too.\nSo I spent the day wondering what the heck I am doing here. (I thought we were all about the rabbit story today!) So much for my rabbit-fication plan\u2026\nI wrote this story because it\u2019s fun. I enjoy writing short stories, and I feel like I\u2019ve said that previously. But I like short stories where the action is fast-paced, so all I had to do was start from the beginning of the story (when the rabbit is first introduced at the park), and build from there. If only that were actually true.","token_len":315,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,10.9122,5.3269,0.8723,7.5295,9.1092,1.6786,6.8759,7.4148,3.5276,8.1428,1.8773,1.4915,4.2675,0.098,2.086,1.2645,2.3546,4.7438,3.0848,16.568,6.6608,2.1999,2.3082,2.3387,2.2433,7.0525,4.0018,0.5116,2.8841,3.1529,0.9837,0.4583,1.8817,3.5661,4.7561,2.2237,2.7333,0.0118,5.8466,0.7331,5.7322,4.7345,4.4008,0.1535,3.2862,3.482,4.2556,5.3919,1.4019,1.0011,0.6592,0.7525,1.5806,7.6485,3.5486,1.0678,1.3199,4.3848,3.2845,3.5199,4.7806,2.428,1.4103,1.0795,3.7702,2.9761,2.9029,0.6643,2.2588,5.1422,3.2808,2.7731,4.4797,0.6141,0.0174,2.3008,4.6115,4.3721,0.5782,4.9929,0.0616,3.2817,1.0477,2.9073,1.9102,4.9026,0.159,2.3961,3.6346,4.2664,4.6095,4.2691,5.7608,2.6512,3.8634,3.5835,3.3378,1.5776,3.2405,4.9505,2.5055,1.0053,1.0413,4.8137,4.7952,1.2853,6.4257,1.4656,3.7713,1.0288,5.7568,2.1497,3.858,3.2622,2.3914,5.2566,2.5757,0.4983,2.7177,0.6433,1.0916,3.9603,3.8352,1.7931,6.224,0.788,0.1175,8.2329,1.0764,0.1947,0.0054,0.1727,6.9498,6.1143,6.105,1.622,6.7005,0.3296,2.258,3.8178,0.1037,4.0162,3.0913,3.4832,6.2518,0.4666,3.3616,2.2926,6.1407,4.5805,0.9746,1.6265,1.2402,2.769,2.5025,0.0334,1.9659,1.9371,4.8626,0.8267,1.3436,2.3519,1.4426,3.8298,6.3169,3.9192,1.5657,1.5205,2.1234,7.4784,0.281,0.3107,3.6355,3.1621,6.0981,0.0694,1.6891,1.0286,0.393,1.9804,2.1545,3.5971,1.8473,0.0553,0.6387,1.6055,5.7989,4.5933,4.0265,0.3786,1.8647,0.7033,6.7659,0.7333,1.3158,3.2531,1.0928,5.117,1.8929,2.1304,4.0791,1.5196,2.6779,2.3533,2.0446,5.9802,1.3854,1.3442,0.7484,5.1275,1.8754,4.641,4.4576,0.5683,3.6776,3.5725,2.926,2.3439,4.9165,7.0429,3.0064,3.8916,4.451,3.7034,3.2604,2.8737,2.7413,4.6895,3.2752,7.9081,3.341,0.9832,2.07,4.6007,2.032,1.3393,1.8679,2.3483,2.8378,0.118,0.6343,3.9684,1.4519,1.5956,6.6396,2.3371,5.4327,0.1722,1.2847,1.0837,1.0682,4.3482,0.9679,0.9917,1.9607,0.0623,1.3694,6.6186,2.0198,8.135,0.6652,2.2246,1.4506,5.4373,4.934,0.1424,5.587,2.2618,4.2422,1.1167,5.0213,2.1351,0.0933,0.8313,3.465,6.1158,1.5207,2.8939,0.1178,0.1017,0.1325,4.2938,3.2767,0.9684,0.2207,3.7944,0.3805,0.2458,4.271,4.958,1.7523,1.1164,1.7179,4.2513,1.4607,5.1624,0.6294,2.3047,2.7568,0.3609,5.3521,2.2498,0.0353,0.1903,4.6916,5.8167,2.9229,2.2655,6.8926,2.7493,0.7523]}
{"prompt":"The creation of the universe is like a slowly loading webpage with Earth being one of the only pieces of `` loaded '' content .

''","text":"The creation of the universe is like a slowly loading webpage with Earth being one of the only pieces of `` loaded '' content. One day, without warning, the rest of the empty universe suddenly `` loads. '' The sudden transition can be described by a quantum jump from the state of being completely empty to a state where everything is loaded. This is analogous to a person going from no pants to pants. If the quantum jumps are not correlated with the other world then we end up in the usual probability states. But since they are correlated they cause the universe to undergo a catastrophic change. So it is not that the universe has no pants anymore, it is only that we, perhaps an invisible intelligence such as Dark Energy, have lost our track. The analogy to pants is that the rest of the pants came from unknown sources. The universe, in the presence of Dark Energy, contains only known sources. The new model of the universe is a mixture of different scenarios without any unifying scenario. If we want more pants then we first have to find the sources of which these pants are made. But if we want to get in touch with something outside our own existence, without our own knowledge then, of course, there is only one way out. The universe is trying to send us a message. Maybe its trying to communicate with itself or with someone in another universe, perhaps even with us? Maybe we have to stop fighting our existence and instead find ourselves as one large puzzle. We need to figure it out. If we think about it this way then all the difficulties are gone.","token_len":315,"entropy":[8.8935,0.1675,1.3468,7.37,1.4893,5.1781,1.425,10.4687,8.6559,10.7139,2.6558,11.3067,5.0077,5.4102,1.655,0.6019,5.335,5.3205,0.8079,14.69,12.3637,2.9517,1.6922,1.0871,5.2979,2.554,1.0749,7.3634,2.8457,0.24,1.3891,6.0575,0.0882,0.2959,9.7505,5.1058,5.1831,9.3463,3.9422,3.237,2.9251,2.4619,7.8726,6.7097,4.498,0.6365,2.8101,1.8178,2.2305,7.7029,4.3596,3.6579,1.8344,4.7164,0.3768,3.6058,5.1648,2.2283,0.2803,1.9188,0.8705,2.6797,2.3627,0.6746,3.9626,1.1113,2.281,1.3271,4.4993,0.0192,1.7528,5.8929,4.3896,0.5292,6.7296,8.4916,0.2352,4.3962,1.7377,3.6037,1.8529,5.6788,2.3939,1.1992,3.0579,7.5194,1.6011,0.8189,5.2316,5.364,6.2929,3.5123,5.5163,0.0086,2.7683,1.7727,6.2096,8.5591,7.2937,1.6871,3.0928,4.6224,4.1146,0.6244,1.8587,3.211,4.7053,1.5432,2.8681,0.051,6.6036,0.6974,6.1572,1.7495,0.7708,4.051,3.1101,0.7842,2.1699,3.3911,1.3852,1.3383,3.0068,2.533,5.0415,3.9356,1.4331,0.7903,1.0057,3.8123,0.1315,2.753,6.6364,6.825,5.4393,5.077,7.6287,6.7283,0.0119,9.9977,3.5103,0.4472,1.5664,4.2172,1.3809,9.6057,2.154,2.1263,7.1172,2.062,8.6217,1.0221,1.7565,1.933,7.3273,0.0096,0.1869,6.3592,7.1308,1.1349,8.6686,1.3381,1.1124,2.0228,2.8298,3.6866,2.5007,2.2959,6.2962,0.0014,3.6113,0.0559,0.2937,6.5904,3.3105,7.6428,3.573,1.2452,2.0072,6.1063,7.9699,1.5281,0.8429,0.3093,1.4211,2.4662,5.1796,0.0269,4.8575,5.8241,7.2521,1.1291,6.7397,0.6076,7.5709,0.3553,3.7675,1.4207,3.9867,6.3571,7.4658,1.9362,0.6683,6.6945,1.3268,0.0276,3.42,1.8882,2.8243,1.2872,6.8172,4.3285,1.8964,1.0667,3.454,0.5437,3.9996,1.9301,0.247,1.7956,0.9391,3.74,5.7055,1.3303,0.046,5.1821,4.2966,2.6369,2.821,5.2132,1.5671,6.8176,3.459,2.4356,1.0533,2.3231,5.0298,3.4764,0.0081,0.0897,2.4233,0.8002,3.3488,0.271,0.7317,2.4606,0.6699,1.9006,3.4652,1.2499,6.5222,0.1049,6.5684,1.7621,2.0114,0.2599,1.349,5.5528,5.3591,4.0752,0.0397,4.2733,0.6027,4.8327,3.3811,2.0103,3.471,3.5443,1.901,1.3278,2.1633,3.2707,2.8309,1.4171,3.0101,4.4923,3.5238,2.0415,2.2142,2.3134,4.3451,6.7364,3.7625,5.7503,1.5052,4.4243,3.7684,4.2417,4.3889,3.1137,7.3872,7.3951,1.1532,2.6928,2.8191,0.3783,3.9193,3.7169,0.1116,0.7822,3.321,0.607,4.9256,1.2539,0.9854,2.6424,0.0094,2.8697,4.4041,1.4848,6.518,2.8835,4.206,0.4398]}

You just need to set aside a designated budget and then never increase that amount of money, otherwise you are going to end up buying things you don\u2019t need.","token_len":316,"entropy":[8.8201,2.3374,2.485,4.444,5.428,1.6212,1.3008,0.5926,9.0464,5.2778,4.2948,7.2462,5.1521,7.3252,1.6135,4.5357,5.331,5.0934,5.6212,6.8916,2.2757,7.0026,0.0004,5.3186,1.4139,4.4446,2.833,1.0502,2.5328,3.0489,3.6206,4.7099,2.7986,3.3031,0.4159,4.8941,0.9164,4.8329,0.3593,2.2424,3.459,1.409,4.0286,0.4835,0.4316,2.2572,3.8322,4.5214,2.7066,1.1639,1.9114,1.6758,3.8718,0.3356,3.3555,5.0046,0.6052,0.6295,0.663,5.0245,1.6942,0.6779,2.9952,4.8006,4.8266,1.9242,0.1576,1.1979,1.7314,6.6461,4.8914,3.0802,0.5202,3.6399,4.021,3.0615,2.8285,3.3994,6.0159,6.0317,0.4215,5.6822,2.4971,2.6856,3.5152,1.9967,3.542,6.2659,5.1043,3.4274,3.8366,1.8292,4.1465,0.4236,2.4409,0.7215,3.6948,4.2964,6.758,0.4566,1.2238,0.8306,1.833,3.3712,2.5889,3.0923,2.6924,6.7969,4.165,2.1105,1.7715,5.593,3.0672,0.7235,0.8325,0.2643,1.88,5.5995,2.7765,3.5739,6.5374,1.5877,7.8488,2.6467,5.615,2.2168,1.856,3.5915,0.0937,5.1048,2.1428,0.5805,1.5122,1.7447,0.1335,3.0106,0.6407,2.3227,5.6509,2.4544,3.4573,1.322,2.6792,6.4678,3.9103,1.7454,1.6636,6.6564,1.9268,3.4037,7.5538,0.9654,1.034,8.2873,7.8295,0.0341,5.138,4.679,2.1602,0.8705,1.1357,4.0209,5.0399,0.2795,1.9949,1.8718,5.1311,0.0444,2.8629,2.9202,1.5977,6.0825,0.4536,7.9773,0.7588,0.4214,4.6231,6.0351,5.0856,3.1037,3.6981,5.2283,0.152,0.2765,0.8815,1.7323,3.6296,1.5245,6.6502,3.3424,3.7211,6.4389,0.9994,0.7417,7.8459,0.011,2.8316,1.0107,6.3493,5.1285,1.5382,1.962,0.9824,1.5226,4.3121,5.8311,0.3621,2.9385,3.0404,2.0444,5.6234,2.1366,0.5174,1.1666,1.3134,1.1218,4.8348,2.0238,5.3282,0.5861,4.5552,1.9574,1.4267,2.8261,3.4346,2.8771,2.2138,3.5718,2.7093,2.0635,1.1099,0.8566,2.4263,4.9424,2.9534,2.4417,4.5296,1.7512,1.8906,6.4985,0.5197,7.7006,0.2097,5.6263,4.7577,3.0196,1.7852,0.5726,2.5242,0.8833,1.6293,2.8419,0.0993,2.4526,5.5057,1.2752,2.0733,1.4343,4.1969,1.6458,1.073,2.4867,2.1046,6.0876,3.1241,0.4578,3.4031,2.9642,1.2727,6.2529,6.186,3.7062,1.4437,1.1855,1.1534,0.6985,4.0057,5.7882,0.869,3.9718,1.9266,2.7478,2.1117,1.3167,0.2707,5.9079,2.7999,1.764,9.4759,4.301,1.3278,3.1178,8.7529,6.9569,2.7084,2.1825,2.4057,0.29,4.392,5.3829,0.6429,2.369,1.5614,0.0062,1.878,0.0021,3.8389,1.898,1.9044,1.8132,17.0075,7.4146,2.6036,0.6845,0.5502]}

There was a recurring joke that if you were looking for someone to \"break out\" then you came across the clown character in the Joke Factory who was always breaking out. She made a good point about her parents who may kill her for what she was.\nMy mom used to talk about that show when I was little (I had never heard of The Joke Factory before). The joke was that every time someone was being rude to her kids, they all walked away. I can picture the kids as the audience on a stage in a circus, sitting along side the clown, with her parents standing behind her, and a few friends standing to the side. They were always very quiet and they always listened politely to whatever the clown was saying, which was always rude stuff.\nThat's a fascinating theory. But I remember seeing the show when it came out. I always wondered what a show like that would do for TV, but I guess that's a good thing.

{"prompt":"What does a traffic light think about as it watches the cars drive past ?","text":"What does a traffic light think about as it watches the cars drive past? I mean for example, if there is a car coming in the right hand side of the yellow light and the car in front of the person is coming in the right hand side of red light, does the traffic light say that the first car in line needs to stop, wait for the light to turn or keep going through the light. And why do some cars that want to go through the yellow light turn and stop at the red light. Just because it is a traffic light the cars know that they have already hit red in the past and in case of a red light they will slow down. and still do not really know what is going on when the red light turns green? \nI am new to this and looking for more information and knowledge about it. \nThank you and sorry if you have already explained this.\n\nA:\n\nIn a traffic light, the light bulbs work using electrical circuits which switch on and off. The electrical current runs through two or more parallel wires \u2013 a green wire, a red wire or a yellow wire. When some traffic passes over the intersections the electrical current flow through green, but the road blocks the lights. Then the current has to come from the wires above and below the intersection which are not yet connected to the light. The current comes from the red light wire and is blocked. This is why the cars stop and turn: there is no blue wire yet which allows the cars to continue their journey. \nFor more details see this answer.","token_len":317,"entropy":[5.8237,3.282,9.4277,2.1837,7.9317,1.9613,4.9007,1.9218,7.2572,2.2184,4.8889,4.5488,2.1193,1.0298,4.45,3.3225,6.7175,2.0832,0.4379,1.9191,3.479,1.4438,0.5179,2.1489,3.2636,2.4789,2.628,2.2813,6.1683,4.1328,0.5398,0.1699,7.5856,1.4556,2.0067,1.6792,1.0801,4.2661,1.7041,1.0203,1.7147,6.093,2.0562,3.8091,0.4017,0.3915,2.3329,1.1693,0.1067,0.5646,6.5174,1.2899,0.5932,2.2325,0.9388,1.0816,0.0686,2.9775,1.958,0.987,7.369,0.7944,1.1986,4.0389,5.9091,0.1249,2.0406,2.701,5.2914,0.9609,0.4976,5.4184,0.2296,1.7241,6.4358,6.3117,0.9195,5.1948,0.8584,4.4863,4.6631,3.3008,5.4244,2.2835,4.8577,1.5971,5.2489,5.1826,0.0977,1.776,1.1525,0.4904,2.4056,0.246,2.4194,3.2034,2.7674,2.9593,0.7684,2.682,0.1814,3.4565,6.1015,1.0558,2.6589,1.6916,2.1172,2.3709,0.0756,7.0052,4.4105,5.3926,1.1679,1.9325,1.8354,6.1115,5.3701,4.468,5.0418,0.8442,1.6851,1.9615,5.4355,5.0911,1.4558,0.855,2.2849,0.0802,1.8997,2.4042,6.1039,0.2706,1.9005,8.3022,5.9951,3.9587,0.8658,6.6878,2.6689,1.0231,2.2129,0.6121,0.2272,4.0395,1.3424,2.7396,0.2089,1.5211,2.4949,6.2672,8.3237,5.1024,4.4609,3.0864,8.0301,0.3557,1.1994,2.5179,7.0543,2.3638,2.8513,1.6168,3.0878,5.8245,1.596,4.2344,0.6512,3.6229,0.5189,5.5452,0.0524,4.2306,4.9055,2.6915,2.1086,0.9703,5.4311,7.4062,2.2043,1.87,1.6985,5.2125,5.0458,3.6988,2.6006,0.0013,4.2312,3.3266,3.5018,0.1049,1.2209,1.6197,2.315,9.186,5.7781,6.665,4.717,5.0424,3.1199,6.5873,1.173,0.6339,0.0298,2.5948,2.0171,3.4731,3.402,5.899,0.581,4.9267,3.7927,0.987,6.5251,1.0988,6.74,2.863,3.7725,1.6013,2.1831,1.6529,0.8053,0.0386,3.2197,0.3905,1.5572,0.0421,0.3699,3.1345,6.2039,3.4415,8.6291,4.3162,0.9071,8.4978,2.5708,2.78,0.3836,5.5275,1.1211,6.099,2.921,4.9933,2.0814,6.98,7.7244,1.168,5.5713,1.407,5.5287,1.1734,5.2253,5.5168,0.4327,3.5829,1.0879,1.0731,4.9822,4.9403,2.3049,2.0688,0.8006,2.2346,4.3273,2.395,3.6129,6.3666,0.8656,1.222,0.5534,2.7086,2.2275,2.1211,3.1473,5.109,0.3248,0.5675,2.6887,1.7619,5.8499,1.7982,2.6428,4.3456,2.834,2.9729,1.1134,2.0077,1.5675,4.9351,3.3169,2.2631,2.4698,6.9941,4.5925,0.3347,0.6931,6.9712,4.1701,8.6082,3.9567,4.4036,1.0155,2.8693,0.0732,2.819,3.1178,1.4205,0.8016,3.2544,0.1788,16.5588,3.0473,3.8768,2.2345,2.809,5.5632,1.8969]}

Nostalgia fades when you realize something is n't quite right ...","text":"You stumble upon old home videos of you and your siblings as toddlers. Nostalgia fades when you realize something isn't quite right... your parents are dead!\nNostalgia is a strong urge to relive a past experience or some part of an experience. Sometimes these feelings are based on a single experience. For example, a person might have been fond of a particular pet or someone once gave that person a present they are unable to find now. Other times nostalgia for a past experience might be based on something that has happened but was not remembered fondly afterwards. These feelings might be tied to certain days of the year, holidays, family trips that were enjoyed very much but then happened so long ago.\nWhat can be said about a feeling that is both strong and irrational and one that makes a person desperate to remember something that is no longer there. What if we were to make memories that were not meant to be shared, but instead secretly be shared by their recipient. A desire for an audience that was never there, a wish for a shared moment, a dream to relive an experience without the other person's presence. A desire to relive something once was, as opposed to reliving something that is not what it ever felt like to be.\nWhat happens when the past is the only time anyone is there watching? What happens when the past is a dream world in and of itself where others are invisible or unknowable? What happens when an experience cannot be shared without losing the experience entirely? What happens when someone is just simply watching a memory that they once knew?","token_len":317,"entropy":[10.947,0.8853,7.8418,7.0018,4.7099,3.031,3.3346,2.5866,0.3738,5.794,5.0637,6.4201,1.3455,11.2,0.1331,7.3925,2.9675,0.5667,2.2624,5.3938,4.6104,0.0004,1.7354,0.0897,5.0851,6.3886,2.2415,1.8146,3.3617,4.0694,2.2815,8.7104,0.3769,0.0071,1.3571,1.2754,5.2435,5.2951,0.5719,5.2364,0.0042,2.7298,2.64,2.959,2.2083,6.4547,4.5121,0.0853,3.5012,1.0984,1.2028,4.3359,4.4038,3.1209,1.451,5.7986,0.3074,2.4727,4.269,2.5247,2.1338,2.8015,0.4054,0.1864,2.7737,3.4393,2.4958,2.3419,2.5087,8.2552,0.1119,1.9252,2.6738,5.2705,1.6666,6.0248,6.6431,4.6147,5.8385,1.2647,0.5027,4.8289,4.3759,5.2397,4.6592,0.0508,4.7089,4.68,0.3544,5.1316,0.1702,5.4443,5.4832,1.3227,1.394,1.1242,3.093,0.6105,1.1699,0.0777,3.4071,1.8906,2.6314,1.0624,4.4419,3.7006,1.1038,4.1342,7.3417,0.0139,6.4384,0.1263,3.5655,1.1152,3.2075,0.8672,5.2426,0.3239,4.3973,6.7364,1.7189,1.1919,0.8714,1.4512,3.2875,0.3081,4.1216,5.4214,5.6573,2.3382,6.6555,6.1591,0.6177,3.0111,4.9806,6.2081,5.4331,3.0907,0.0603,3.1824,0.9348,3.5795,3.1937,2.4897,2.5424,0.3883,3.5101,4.4695,2.8956,1.4792,5.4469,2.5336,0.0625,7.6152,3.8862,4.8383,0.6277,4.4294,3.5378,0.3106,8.0082,0.7283,2.6744,2.0653,2.4539,2.4336,3.4151,0.0436,1.1399,3.5463,4.2075,4.4917,3.576,2.7565,0.4434,4.1083,4.5627,2.3837,2.3041,2.5107,4.9867,0.102,0.4321,4.9135,2.4837,1.6308,2.654,10.4177,5.2164,1.4004,2.7767,6.3206,9.6722,2.7352,4.26,5.6368,1.9346,3.9922,6.7168,2.8852,3.518,2.3327,2.2918,2.0899,2.8607,4.096,1.3518,1.5805,4.0605,4.6424,1.9721,1.084,3.8854,3.4139,6.8265,0.0016,3.6285,0.6497,4.3171,2.7055,5.2371,0.7059,1.674,4.3208,0.7366,3.1221,0.8967,0.9055,3.8123,0.0033,1.665,5.7322,6.4663,5.1547,3.7797,3.8419,0.001,5.7829,0.0207,2.2362,1.8623,1.7765,2.1854,6.3921,1.1079,7.6731,4.7649,0.3691,1.7465,0.794,0.8985,0.9552,2.6784,3.5985,0.4328,3.2495,5.1069,1.3274,5.1638,1.9364,4.4836,5.3278,3.1713,3.5219,6.7752,1.3415,2.5394,0.9131,0.1885,1.52,2.1043,0.5048,3.2934,6.1542,6.6548,4.3723,6.3461,0.0771,0.0037,6.6998,6.2393,1.4593,6.5914,3.0876,6.2065,0.1794,0.7057,1.0952,0.3216,0.1331,4.1712,1.9174,5.3983,0.2803,1.7746,2.505,6.1798,1.7003,4.2022,6.3593,0.3279,1.1811,0.3217,0.1356,2.7158,1.8216,4.795,5.8538,4.2661,2.4989,3.9374,2.1263,2.3426,5.1111,2.5856,2.1887]}
{"prompt":"While interning at a hospital , you notice every few weeks cadavers go missing . You begin to investigate .","text":"While interning at a hospital, you notice every few weeks cadavers go missing. You begin to investigate. As you look into the disappearance of the corpses and begin to understand the story, your life goes from being good to bad to worse. What happens next will leave you wondering.\nWhen the corpses disappear, do you call the police? What will you do the next time you see a ghost?\nI enjoyed this read because it was well-written. The pace is fast to allow the reader the chance to be immersed in the narrative. The scenes were well-executed. The dialogue was strong. I appreciated the attention to detail. I liked the fact that the book kept the reader in the dark and didn\u2019t reveal the identity of the author. That was good.\nWhile I didn\u2019t have the time to learn all the details of the story, I did get to know some interesting information and characters. I gained a good understanding of how the story unfolded. I felt like I was there with the characters. But not in a movie.\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019m not comfortable with in a good read. One is the usage of language and characters. For example, the characters use words like \u201c nasty \u201d and \u201c foul \u201d to describe one another.\nAn author has a right to use language in order to describe what is happening. It\u2019s what makes the story work. However, when that language becomes descriptive and takes away from the enjoyment of the reader, I worry.","token_len":317,"entropy":[11.9058,1.4525,1.2473,2.8449,5.3757,1.2549,4.8033,6.6073,5.4845,4.5759,1.6894,10.0078,3.5767,0.7526,5.5319,1.7458,0.925,2.5531,5.155,0.3508,5.6584,2.0194,4.5677,1.2026,3.8465,2.1716,0.9276,3.7078,0.5531,1.7338,5.563,2.7633,5.452,0.3418,2.9258,1.4427,5.0573,1.4505,2.5359,4.7451,3.8151,1.1285,2.8314,6.2927,0.2251,2.2127,6.0767,2.5698,0.2176,3.82,2.8913,1.771,2.7232,4.6818,0.1684,2.9125,2.0996,0.943,9.6993,2.592,4.9142,2.7995,0.324,3.8394,0.3484,6.1108,1.7239,0.5321,0.7951,2.4386,2.9669,1.6531,0.3603,6.2601,0.1117,1.9413,1.5709,1.4029,1.6437,3.4045,0.4586,2.0865,4.0877,7.0966,2.2551,6.5424,3.9171,0.656,2.1004,4.3879,1.932,0.5998,2.058,2.0793,7.1918,1.9601,2.1853,5.7324,7.9105,1.9415,0.32,4.1253,2.2757,0.0163,4.7542,2.5435,0.1872,0.4482,4.5325,1.104,1.7603,6.8211,3.5684,1.9376,1.3885,2.5935,0.0013,1.9633,1.0274,3.8507,0.6998,4.4002,1.3459,2.0504,4.4886,0.8487,5.2082,0.2702,0.0332,1.2107,1.5781,3.4744,0.8496,2.8467,0.0693,1.1548,3.716,5.6858,2.9535,1.2779,2.6345,0.4826,2.2197,2.6236,4.6334,17.2524,7.2841,1.5163,5.1144,1.9846,3.317,0.0756,0.2664,2.3534,0.6889,4.8566,2.1899,3.7816,0.8779,1.211,4.9809,1.0605,3.2921,1.3518,0.1432,0.0342,3.1504,1.7214,1.113,0.3789,5.9491,2.1591,1.2226,1.4058,1.3616,0.5687,2.3463,0.4555,0.4228,1.7374,3.3695,1.0336,2.407,2.2658,3.599,5.946,3.3658,3.56,0.6786,1.5049,7.2001,1.1142,2.8601,0.9434,0.1014,2.2761,1.2064,2.449,3.1955,0.9916,1.2363,4.1544,1.4199,0.5537,0.9286,5.3168,4.2014,0.8573,1.9103,1.218,5.1634,4.8858,3.1351,1.4002,6.6423,1.2277,1.4319,3.8804,1.4635,1.9657,2.2968,0.4806,1.3094,0.9548,1.1391,8.1429,0.4541,1.0851,0.8346,5.6582,0.5583,1.9842,1.2435,5.8466,4.0733,0.3653,1.8974,0.6383,1.1112,8.4422,0.0408,4.1326,2.2742,4.3014,0.5674,4.3225,0.8343,0.1362,1.9415,3.3233,3.3332,3.3043,1.4378,5.6706,5.7206,11.8008,4.1245,5.409,1.8543,0.879,1.4562,6.4567,0.4099,0.2756,1.9749,0.5878,5.2179,0.1219,0.3018,3.1729,6.0389,4.873,3.6,2.096,3.098,0.0332,1.4379,1.9399,2.7522,3.1319,0.0413,3.6153,2.7129,2.1746,1.85,1.3747,3.0638,2.0232,0.3227,0.3121,4.1524,3.1351,1.4533,1.0786,3.613,0.2944,3.3269,0.0406,2.641,4.9181,1.6916,3.3498,7.7744,2.2546,5.7505,2.4731,1.6391,0.2618,6.0274,0.4238,0.3052,1.2392,0.3135,2.3583,5.2244,3.9917]}

Soon you come upon an abandoned train. The floor is littered with human remains, bones and what look to be half-decomposed bodies. But you can t reach it. You have no way of getting off the train. A signal flashes - someone is coming. When you get your bearings you realize, looking back, that you've been pulled back time - back ten years in time.\nIn the mid-1980s we began a new era in the legal world when the Justice Department, Congress, state legislatures, and other key players began using computer technology to digitize and improve the law. For almost two decades, law was largely a paper-based industry, and then we all saw law as an electronic industry, a place where, for a fee, you could have access to, modify, and distribute content (including legal documents) instantly. This era is now over.\nWhen I began teaching legal technology in the early 1990s I asked students what they thought the best way to teach. Some asked if there was a good handbook. Others asked if there was software that would allow them to do their own search in the law. Many students simply said \u201cI want a computer and a printer.\u201d They were excited but not completely convinced that digital content was the answer to any of their legal issues. The early years of law school were an age of trial and error when students learned the meaning of searchable sources of law.","token_len":321,"entropy":[3.0338,3.2989,6.5147,11.3749,3.9285,1.2571,7.7265,4.3064,0.8136,0.4238,0.8675,0.7785,3.809,0.0344,0.9603,6.6764,0.2156,0.7095,5.4893,2.7087,4.0216,1.7918,4.7471,0.2593,3.3401,4.2234,0.2666,2.1682,8.409,0.9487,4.4425,2.14,2.5341,2.6939,4.4849,2.0926,2.3094,7.5248,0.7256,2.3234,0.0116,5.4353,1.1835,1.409,4.8189,1.6239,6.4604,3.022,3.2008,0.1569,7.7233,0.5798,4.7736,6.5288,0.0225,1.5154,0.5493,4.5388,2.0036,1.7081,11.0881,12.0508,3.4757,1.7953,1.4649,3.7578,1.8975,3.1266,0.7834,2.7718,4.5349,1.2745,0.2721,0.7754,4.2281,7.352,5.4207,6.2507,6.5613,1.8009,3.4494,0.8977,5.2164,0.4643,2.9952,4.707,1.2028,2.0541,2.5338,5.3482,6.2673,1.6566,0.7785,0.5836,1.162,1.6975,1.8444,4.847,3.2079,7.6374,5.7251,4.0529,6.4766,1.2387,4.4883,4.4912,0.57,2.6651,6.9469,1.4234,5.4398,0.3088,2.9616,0.1774,5.0267,3.4858,2.2993,2.6868,1.3875,1.3873,1.7079,7.2621,2.5698,4.8141,1.8755,5.6055,0.0359,3.6167,5.7795,1.0693,4.6575,1.2964,0.8835,0.642,3.2194,7.0459,1.8839,2.3206,4.504,6.0701,2.9875,0.1911,8.3596,0.0172,2.0191,6.4963,1.5043,3.6562,0.8222,4.8375,4.296,2.4011,0.2393,0.9509,3.6807,4.1006,5.582,3.1291,5.3599,2.1281,2.2198,5.2794,1.7006,2.3033,5.3562,3.4569,3.8334,3.6075,5.3532,2.5322,2.2454,4.2834,3.7447,1.9501,2.101,5.1135,0.2924,5.2506,2.5419,2.4556,4.6745,0.1352,2.3211,0.3535,4.0184,3.7711,0.0333,5.9452,7.3827,0.2888,0.7366,4.7278,6.4104,5.7383,3.1829,3.0462,1.5068,0.953,6.4136,0.7421,3.4263,4.6255,2.5408,2.3339,0.907,0.5641,1.2783,4.5234,2.0567,4.2291,4.5992,2.9217,4.8362,1.8737,2.0973,1.9485,0.7926,0.0065,2.5143,5.7057,4.1614,2.4095,0.8886,0.8356,2.7115,4.4138,1.1937,0.1581,3.9628,6.6423,3.1673,3.2868,2.4735,2.6393,0.5357,1.0697,3.5252,10.4069,0.1501,2.0285,1.459,0.883,0.6039,0.6693,0.3494,7.5549,1.6925,1.8108,2.3826,1.909,0.0178,2.5989,4.3496,0.5964,6.3633,3.8363,1.6551,2.3698,0.776,4.0717,1.5929,4.7251,1.7136,13.404,8.1166,3.5272,2.7663,2.8591,3.7303,3.6107,1.8009,4.2021,1.6265,2.3288,7.1509,3.5619,1.9703,4.3579,5.0872,2.4379,4.7578,0.9301,2.0694,5.814,4.073,1.4559,1.6469,1.9562,2.2105,3.6673,1.8586,1.8715,2.6043,2.9097,0.1294,3.3049,6.9652,2.6507,0.5199,1.0335,1.9826,1.1765,4.1651,5.9654,1.1729,6.6797,1.3247,0.0538,5.1501,4.1641,3.5797,2.1571,5.7781,0.197,6.8562,3.1126,7.7412,2.2453,2.1418,0.8863]}

{"prompt":"You wake up in the morning and step outside to go to work , only to see something extremely unusual in the sky .","text":"You wake up in the morning and step outside to go to work, only to see something extremely unusual in the sky. Something that never happens in real life. Something which never actually happened before.\nIf you watch closely, you can see a number of large clouds. There are not clouds visible anywhere else. They hang there in the sky, just above the horizon. As you move past the clouds with your eyes, they move slowly, forming a continuous circle. This is a phenomenon known as air bubble clouds. It happens everywhere in the world. It can be seen in the western part of Europe, Asia, Australia.\nThe first bubble clouds were observed in Iceland. And they are one of the rare phenomena of an actual occurrence. A series of bubbles form a regular circular pattern that can be seen from space.\nWhat is the mystery behind bubble clouds? It is interesting to learn that these clouds form when fog rises to the top of a mountain. There, fog starts to condense, but this fog is so humid that liquid water can\u2019t evaporate. As humidity comes up from the ground, fog continues to condense. It becomes rain. When rain reaches a certain height, the water falls and it doesn\u2019t condense again.\nThe bubbles appear in the clouds as a result of the collision of raindrops with air. They are a result of the air, which is too humid for raindrops to collide between them. After all, raindrops evaporate as soon as they begin to touch. It gives the appearance of a shower or a puddle on the ground.","token_len":323,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,1.8557,0.6009,0.6131,1.1042,8.4596,1.464,2.0539,3.8856,1.3453,2.1365,1.939,6.2446,0.0928,3.4432,4.8385,7.3996,3.2728,3.2631,0.689,1.9837,0.7558,4.6699,1.7788,5.6452,3.1559,2.076,0.9654,0.0175,0.785,3.5535,4.847,3.1559,4.3528,0.9325,4.1925,0.6233,1.8711,10.4251,0.6058,5.4255,5.883,0.6619,0.3751,0.8484,0.7086,2.5171,4.7329,0.0544,5.3776,3.7466,3.3231,3.0651,0.7015,5.3459,4.115,5.2154,4.6853,2.0131,1.7333,2.7529,8.3261,3.2212,3.01,0.6637,0.9341,2.1743,4.0953,2.5035,0.7553,0.793,0.4864,4.8594,0.7715,1.9717,5.0961,1.4012,0.5467,6.6076,0.4202,0.6704,0.3025,2.4583,3.3976,3.1911,2.1364,5.1687,1.0407,4.7216,2.8583,0.7322,3.176,1.0749,2.5778,3.7532,1.0035,0.0387,7.2211,5.0041,5.5786,0.3348,3.2516,3.7363,5.6938,1.7184,0.3164,1.7167,0.7197,2.0245,3.3936,0.8661,0.6055,1.4278,1.7164,6.8866,4.4833,0.0037,3.0448,0.8345,4.9126,0.3306,2.3247,3.7692,1.8934,2.2974,3.376,5.8977,2.1587,1.5349,3.4442,0.8472,5.5841,2.315,5.3496,1.9026,1.6188,5.1839,0.063,0.1253,5.1344,2.9853,3.2114,6.6832,3.8325,2.9218,0.6402,4.3168,6.0271,0.0089,2.6559,3.9107,5.2604,6.0778,4.2446,1.9976,3.3073,3.4272,0.6655,0.2956,2.2138,2.6876,0.4517,2.2206,3.93,1.2849,1.6559,5.3991,1.9036,6.3287,0.1666,0.1498,2.9723,0.6997,5.0104,0.7444,4.8661,0.6385,3.3048,2.029,3.1688,2.0143,6.7807,3.9979,4.0722,0.7506,2.6794,0.2452,2.2237,1.3178,0.8939,4.1304,2.6738,3.3297,5.7058,0.4006,5.2541,0.0042,1.8485,3.748,3.7169,4.6452,1.7942,3.7312,7.108,0.2369,8.351,2.0428,1.804,18.9735,8.1724,3.6566,3.1303,0.0003,1.5725,3.635,6.1938,6.5353,1.4267,2.7832,0.3476,2.9799,0.2909,3.9171,4.7963,0.2057,1.5279,0.0033,1.0839,3.1199,3.8921,7.4102,1.8156,3.522,3.0108,4.5847,2.6171,0.3997,1.9979,0.2282,1.4469,2.2839,4.7191,3.1407,3.1117,5.8991,3.2933,1.0501,0.1412,2.2598,0.0308,2.7464,0.2047,1.5038,1.9488,5.7317,4.1689,2.0436,1.2976,2.7287,2.1335,1.5471,3.5585,0.0075,1.4153,8.7547,0.2268,4.5757,2.0237,2.6824,3.4489,0.5667,2.9817,1.2404,3.4792,2.8576,0.0176,0.937,4.4452,5.222,1.5413,0.8781,5.7306,2.3947,1.3997,2.9474,2.7824,0.2714,6.4856,7.1927,1.2455,0.186,5.4682,3.8605,0.1159,2.9044,0.5316,7.1614,0.0125,3.2342,2.925,0.0063,0.4284,5.5764,0.2142,5.5621,4.7015,3.6663,6.2691,2.5485,3.9785,0.0805,1.033,5.7742,3.4029,1.0619,6.6437,0.0969,4.1233,0.3962,0.1814,0.3043]}

No! Stop now before the 20 second mark is reached and you will kill me ( you will die anyway, but not now ). Are there any other methods that allow you to kill this person, while in the face of imminent death??\nIt depends what you mean by \"in the face of\"... If you mean that the person has to choose (with no more than 20 seconds), then the usual option is to do an escape stunt to get rid of him in the end. Otherwise, some of the above might fit.\nFor example, instead of just letting him kill you in 20 seconds, you may set a timer to 60 seconds, then do a stunt to kill him outside of this time limit, then do a stunt to hide in a closet next to his office, and make him think you're coming back. You can have your stunt appear at the same time, so he will be suspicious, but won't be able to do much about it. And of course, you can take any of the other stunt alternatives if you want.\nAnother idea is to just stare at him.

You should try to just look disinterested and stare out the window or straight ahead. You should definitely make him think about running away, not smiling at him.","token_len":324,"entropy":[5.2847,6.3255,2.0542,1.683,3.8011,1.4066,4.4575,4.0748,0.7505,5.5492,1.473,0.5051,8.1552,5.0343,2.9811,3.2035,0.0728,1.2053,0.1815,4.6732,5.096,2.1059,1.1314,5.2321,5.3771,4.1749,5.6607,6.2278,3.2317,8.117,2.1906,0.2441,3.3709,2.6416,2.5619,1.7867,2.3911,4.1506,1.1454,6.6168,8.9044,3.4432,3.2048,4.1177,2.9044,2.9602,3.3803,5.657,2.3034,6.6367,4.8842,0.6797,1.2138,4.4217,2.2216,6.5108,0.2578,0.0554,1.8603,3.0466,2.0374,3.1006,6.5898,4.4029,1.3573,4.6636,0.1038,5.2185,0.8918,5.8936,1.8246,6.4971,4.8365,2.8991,1.2952,2.3136,0.3283,1.0371,4.0476,0.3119,0.0118,0.0109,11.446,3.9603,0.5205,5.9065,2.8552,2.0757,1.267,3.6715,3.0905,6.634,6.2059,4.7902,2.9401,6.103,0.5575,3.151,0.1467,4.0282,0.7498,2.4446,9.2783,3.5458,0.4751,0.6279,4.5547,4.9736,5.4906,8.9658,3.9188,1.793,4.3544,0.0054,1.7223,4.3886,1.3551,4.3772,0.6468,4.0429,0.507,5.8812,3.0161,0.4359,5.4464,4.2223,6.9004,1.7983,1.528,4.4882,1.8556,0.2397,6.7926,0.0054,3.8271,4.2314,1.0251,3.7491,0.3196,1.8791,1.3165,0.0513,0.3884,0.8089,3.3369,5.6121,2.629,0.6947,1.3833,6.2256,0.0932,1.9516,2.2136,3.9844,1.5467,4.6971,1.2349,2.6783,0.3533,7.4579,0.7757,3.2954,0.9614,1.3341,2.3287,1.8276,1.9249,0.7974,2.161,0.4656,5.4353,1.3809,1.2608,3.814,5.8885,0.0373,2.6225,5.0038,1.5387,1.7583,6.6663,1.7184,5.2549,1.1676,0.988,5.1224,2.0923,1.7447,3.0216,1.3681,4.9107,3.408,3.7389,8.1414,2.6071,1.4861,3.7071,0.2593,1.9577,3.1519,2.1886,2.7961,2.3998,6.058,2.2246,1.1436,4.4407,0.0004,2.2279,0.8094,0.0015,4.2025,4.4082,2.2166,0.148,0.5731,4.4789,3.8247,0.0027,0.4423,1.4989,0.7618,4.5101,3.6728,1.5467,0.6097,1.6413,3.866,5.7075,3.9379,0.5205,1.1724,1.1554,0.7886,3.9524,5.0522,0.6914,0.2953,3.8864,8.0814,0.5413,0.933,3.365,4.3573,3.7447,4.0551,0.8261,2.534,4.3681,0.7658,1.1159,3.9396,5.5831,8.5192,1.9799,9.2553,0.718,1.2817,0.9788,4.5102,1.8693,2.6282,4.3335,0.0609,0.9386,3.3091,3.7231,3.1005,0.0036,0.9024,6.7239,2.7565,0.0164,1.7623,0.5106,3.4371,2.4701,2.8495,5.0392,7.2107,1.881,2.2504,2.7685,3.0065,0.4796,2.116,2.5034,0.1229,4.793,0.8331,1.7813,2.9924,3.7448,3.3532,0.6005,5.1089,2.5832,12.3677,0.8203,1.5854,5.0601,4.8037,0.8275,0.1075,4.2194,7.7576,2.0439,0.9251,2.9751,2.7399,6.0372,4.1016,1.7319,1.2613,3.7445,4.6135,0.4982,1.6481,2.8871,6.7767,1.9542,0.9199,0.4623]}

Not only the regulatory, tax, regulatory and financing challenges are not as onerous as they have been and they are not necessarily so high compared to new- drugs - biosimilars are often cheaper as well. But as with any emerging market it requires you to understand how to navigate the trade-offs and to manage the risks. The main focus below is on the trade-challenges related to biosimilar manufacturing.\nTo fully understand the risks involved in a biosimilar project, there is a certain amount of familiarity with the manufacturing industry in general, which includes the regulatory procedures and manufacturing procedures employed for any new drugs. For this reason most analysts will recommend that the company get the necessary expertise, experience from the established players in the pharmaceutical manufacturing space.","token_len":324,"entropy":[3.8828,6.7105,0.0496,1.3976,2.7024,9.517,1.6462,4.6614,3.2277,0.0433,3.5003,8.9529,4.1568,2.4849,2.355,2.0297,5.1405,3.7978,5.57,1.4586,5.2331,0.5352,0.718,7.8449,2.8495,8.5152,2.7646,2.3452,1.389,11.1332,1.7022,1.1142,5.9523,3.1989,2.3317,3.6743,0.7137,2.8407,0.4673,3.569,0.2214,0.9081,3.6451,2.7397,3.9342,0.7533,1.8752,2.3616,3.5565,1.1585,1.0567,1.2661,5.3669,3.2613,0.0724,0.8028,7.1715,4.7625,1.6129,0.3859,2.7067,1.9228,2.7769,11.5421,0.0078,6.2208,1.9513,1.0252,1.0493,5.2951,0.5696,2.7989,3.0157,0.2017,1.6669,2.4873,3.5648,0.8554,8.2502,3.1636,1.49,4.1897,0.1783,0.5186,0.4462,1.0113,2.7017,1.7472,3.551,1.2762,3.0559,6.274,6.0076,1.713,5.9448,1.7437,6.8345,3.8316,0.8117,0.3071,1.1851,1.6099,5.1516,0.6143,2.8264,2.8637,1.6192,4.4575,5.8505,2.5894,5.5646,2.4526,1.6523,1.9169,3.5148,4.7871,1.4907,3.3975,0.0039,0.62,4.7101,1.1804,3.1025,0.1843,5.1192,2.9076,6.7125,5.5131,2.4442,3.7297,6.8257,1.0165,1.0408,2.0536,2.209,3.0144,3.8023,1.0988,4.7328,0.8371,1.9056,0.8079,3.1247,2.5432,7.3231,1.802,6.103,9.1067,3.0851,3.7323,0.4919,3.1737,7.8305,7.8859,6.5734,12.2681,3.0973,7.657,3.5703,7.0929,6.2449,5.0363,1.2932,2.7026,2.7656,0.2486,2.4569,5.325,6.2401,6.9268,5.381,0.791,0.2143,6.1334,0.4173,5.9912,9.0045,4.3548,4.6151,0.9072,3.8474,1.3694,7.9427,4.2288,2.3961,4.157,2.6441,7.7037,0.0153,0.3725,1.2581,4.5241,0.1912,4.9706,3.7488,1.1294,1.6718,5.0195,5.3765,4.135,5.1907,0.1113,4.6932,4.9241,11.9073,6.2324,9.5915,2.5861,0.0033,1.3814,3.9793,2.1743,4.5555,0.5411,0.3981,3.3859,3.844,2.5752,1.2871,5.397,1.3971,4.3446,3.8328,5.9496,0.0647,3.8143,2.6398,1.8232,5.3621,1.2914,5.6326,1.3786,0.3987,1.8549,4.118,4.5717,1.6889,1.2109,0.8965,2.832,4.9369,6.0062,9.4161,0.2569,0.6801,1.4164,5.4786,0.1115,15.4279,0.1439,4.5425,0.0249,2.2814,0.4583,0.395,0.6916,1.4528,4.9202,5.8677,0.1297,0.8724,2.0443,2.1314,0.9631,3.1304,1.0705,0.0051,5.8371,0.4967,4.4437,1.7429,0.7456,5.7229,1.1933,0.0549,5.4552,0.8794,0.6856,5.0995,3.7119,3.438,1.9785,2.3924,3.0225,4.4499,1.7697,5.4681,6.9146,1.3351,5.5398,3.1855,4.9528,3.3422,4.2119,1.5313,3.2584,0.7933,3.5321,2.1726,0.6793,5.6142,6.7233,2.3082,3.8927,1.4353,3.2675,4.1265,5.3809,3.1652,2.528,4.1956,2.8996,2.4817,6.409,1.2686,6.893,6.6926,1.2861,0.2575,5.0686,4.0859,3.625,1.3131]}

He kept going to me over and over again and he was wearing a camo jacket. Then my girlfriend just walked up to me and she started asking me where I was going, and I told her they were just taking pictures of me. She turned around, looked at me and asked them what they were doing. One of them said'shoot that guy up in the forehead' like nothing in the world was going to happen, and they walked away from me. Then I started crying and the guy just laughed at me when he saw it. A few seconds later, an ambulance pulled up to the car that was following me and my girlfriend told the police that she saw him hit me and that I was knocked over. The police said it wasn't their job to come out and help me, so I called an ambulance that was actually already stopping at a hospital and I got in the ambulance with the police. I went to the hospital and the doctors told me I was going to be fine, but that if I had hit my head earlier, I might not be in trouble right now. I was later transferred to a mental hospital in Santa Monica for an MRI and it showed three fractures to my skull.","token_len":327,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,5.3591,8.081,2.052,7.0571,0.7806,1.3109,2.8018,4.849,2.5463,0.7443,3.5333,0.7284,10.5064,0.8274,1.0095,6.7041,0.2477,8.1362,0.2288,10.4838,7.2352,6.0625,2.023,1.7367,2.8613,3.1838,5.0803,1.2516,1.6074,3.8324,3.9747,0.5445,4.351,1.12,0.0301,13.9006,6.5408,4.1301,1.4964,10.1467,3.6794,6.5687,14.3876,5.0696,3.4867,1.0314,6.4962,4.9931,2.7194,2.9147,1.3896,1.3352,3.3594,0.0028,0.0004,0.3895,2.85,2.695,0.3827,6.6221,6.0174,2.4547,5.8326,0.8472,0.9999,2.9978,2.7508,1.6078,5.5102,2.691,5.2802,2.4779,1.0212,0.5314,0.1681,0.5077,2.1768,4.8174,0.3539,0.8725,0.702,0.5406,1.68,4.734,2.8718,4.0619,2.96,5.4827,0.099,0.0053,1.1901,1.7113,2.5608,1.9659,5.9149,1.1321,6.7736,0.9765,2.9659,1.4074,4.1676,5.5278,3.7529,4.7845,2.4184,0.7314,0.7367,0.3905,0.2506,3.2801,2.2183,3.1841,0.7205,3.8847,0.7493,0.5241,1.8216,2.3828,0.73,0.4836,2.1467,0.0193,6.9303,0.7416,3.6237,3.1401,0.2132,1.0318,0.3306,0.6613,1.6743,5.7739,0.7723,2.8039,2.8533,0.6027,0.1415,0.7393,3.4344,7.5378,2.2485,1.5699,0.2192,0.3808,0.8539,5.7011,0.2987,0.7844,1.2982,8.8795,6.8279,3.6075,3.7058,6.134,7.2874,3.0375,0.7571,11.1725,8.9557,6.1702,6.9082,5.5904,0.6615,0.1091,3.3834,1.1654,0.476,0.4941,2.5537,0.8133,3.7481,4.5351,0.8251,2.9074,0.4734,0.6236,3.2666,1.2402,2.9837,3.1096,1.4458,4.9213,2.2533,3.3888,5.3075,1.4413,0.1418,5.4452,1.686,1.0503,3.1683,0.6579,5.5326,0.8308,4.1269,0.0827,1.2791,6.4149,3.5262,3.1234,0.6388,2.3389,1.7366,3.1437,3.4593,0.8902,6.1668,0.3042,2.1414,3.9822,1.2689,5.2536,2.7203,1.2809,1.3699,1.908,2.0692,2.3709,6.1761,1.4482,2.3591,1.8028,1.8562,0.876,5.9582,1.7989,0.9426,2.6146,1.378,2.6011,2.7322,2.9649,0.0099,4.8113,4.0427,0.2868,4.5736,2.5987,0.7181,3.5265,1.1444,1.0487,1.7377,0.9149,2.7615,4.7406,0.2298,3.837,1.7642,5.2852,6.8389,7.0706,1.3795,1.9473,2.5984,2.3783,2.3122,2.8838,2.6936,1.0492,0.3001,2.784,1.8506,2.1438,0.9967,1.3274,2.9996,0.8087,0.6579,0.5096,0.9664,2.9498,3.4245,1.3321,0.0198,1.5995,1.034,2.6016,0.0674,1.5542,2.4293,1.5884,1.2208,2.3946,3.829,0.5147,3.3542,4.4288,2.3789,0.7635,7.7464,0.9443,0.8778,3.377,1.4736,1.3544,3.0629,6.182,4.8198,0.1334,0.2321,1.1315,1.735,6.5039,3.3839,0.1395,1.2511,2.2897,0.944,1.784,5.8174,1.2069,2.5854,3.5771,4.6566,1.6631,3.2539,2.5851,6.285,3.2802,2.0691,0.7965,1.2625,0.9519]}

We can either continue to be caught up in the entanglement while remaining totally unconscious of its harmful effects. Or we can seek help from another and get the emotional help we desperately need. That seems easy enough. The thing about emotional entanglement is that it only exists in our own mind. There is no outside person or situation to blame. Once you realize it\u2019s your own mind that is in the trouble with it, not anyone else, and you acknowledge that the only way to get out of emotional torment caused by emotional entanglement is to get help, you begin to see how important that help really is. There is no easy or quick way out. The best way to be free from emotional entanglement is to recognize that it is not a person or a situation that you can blame or condemn. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s in your mind. It\u2019s in your heart, not in the environment.\nIt comes down to a realization. The only thing wrong with us is our thinking.

It felt perfect. It was an intense pleasure with a hint of pain. It was not just a feeling though, it was the true existence of the thing that was in pain. Then the pain stopped.","token_len":327,"entropy":[8.9133,3.3118,3.1931,10.1596,0.9553,2.2513,2.4338,3.1917,7.0919,3.2718,0.9689,0.842,5.6701,1.3435,5.1809,1.0961,3.2484,1.8095,1.8966,1.6545,2.2667,4.2263,4.4888,2.3642,0.0476,5.058,0.3077,5.6538,5.15,1.7061,3.0543,0.2457,5.741,1.4227,1.1456,3.7966,4.4306,5.029,1.9313,0.2335,0.7974,4.7252,1.3054,1.3494,0.6271,2.5524,0.0704,2.6839,2.0615,4.4321,0.7756,2.4578,3.295,2.9808,3.3553,0.4672,1.9409,5.0295,0.4412,3.0616,2.8618,0.4059,2.4142,2.2062,2.2117,0.0366,6.2513,0.6157,1.1809,5.984,0.1538,2.6772,2.9803,1.0895,0.848,2.5709,2.3546,3.1722,0.489,3.0617,4.3201,4.7276,3.783,3.6015,2.3536,0.5365,0.633,3.1066,1.2879,2.1544,5.3224,5.3983,3.5299,7.0124,3.2493,6.4226,4.4088,2.9698,6.5366,0.3089,10.9466,1.0451,0.1379,0.0534,0.4494,5.444,0.9291,1.7428,3.6095,2.3081,1.089,2.3066,6.3381,1.0504,2.7546,2.1365,0.6353,4.4349,0.004,5.5192,5.5247,1.158,0.6483,2.1797,3.8975,2.7872,1.4436,4.2886,7.0443,7.4964,1.5112,2.0591,3.3585,2.64,3.3341,0.4639,6.7425,5.6041,1.319,1.894,1.2939,5.7634,3.6874,3.1665,0.5497,4.9023,9.8341,1.0639,4.8754,5.8423,0.4188,0.7977,3.105,0.6891,4.004,4.9317,2.5668,0.2415,3.0822,3.6778,3.5857,6.0959,1.6402,1.2253,4.9606,3.9356,1.9255,0.0282,1.312,3.7796,6.8587,0.9856,2.5624,5.8004,1.0925,1.3621,2.141,1.3857,13.5222,7.4416,7.4495,0.2689,0.9867,1.9135,5.8842,0.367,4.3226,1.1092,6.1588,4.9894,2.6621,6.8472,3.6933,4.4451,6.1748,3.1101,0.3637,1.9679,5.9254,2.7424,1.3325,2.2573,0.9971,4.4475,0.8793,6.1275,3.1605,2.2601,1.858,0.3313,0.7824,1.0892,2.6261,1.7737,5.1275,0.1124,7.2046,4.835,0.0447,0.888,2.4505,0.6025,1.2269,1.8387,2.9984,4.4804,7.7501,2.0664,1.2485,4.48,4.4441,1.6578,6.3349,0.4379,1.0303,3.8753,5.5456,1.1563,0.8433,2.0735,9.2877,0.9844,1.1109,1.8555,2.2212,0.5242,1.5283,5.5526,4.4463,1.2358,3.5718,0.2235,7.4535,2.7263,0.0012,0.9411,2.6619,3.9165,4.8472,2.0336,4.0414,0.4077,3.5841,2.7359,3.0004,2.7629,4.3661,5.2041,3.302,4.6619,0.0648,0.7439,0.9661,1.5556,2.4341,2.4368,4.9627,1.4646,4.4393,0.8617,2.1049,0.7475,3.1939,2.9331,0.9033,0.8499,1.7593,5.7865,0.7497,0.8675,1.4133,4.3497,5.0223,3.5655,5.8374,2.0797,6.0486,0.0096,2.8958,1.3447,0.9149,1.0363,3.056,2.8375,1.5445,3.1377,6.5945,0.7513,0.6486,0.1876,2.5342,5.7375,6.7371,0.3121,1.7667,4.5408,1.4255,2.0185,3.9007,4.7566,0.5426,6.3707,2.5517,0.8738,2.9279,1.083]}

What we really want the reader to realize are the true meaning of the book not to go through a life, trying to find love in theirs own country. We want to tell the reader that it is possible to love in any situation, and that is something that is not that simple. A true love is there in every situation and can be found in any country.\nIt was a beautiful piece of writing. I think it would be a great movie. That is why I am giving a 9. But it had many things I didn t care for. Like the main character and some other parts. A 9 is a good grade just be aware there will be a few things that are not going to appeal to everyone.\nAn effective, modern poem with themes that are universal. I enjoyed it. The poet was not trying to write a love poem or to persuade anyone to love and appreciate life. It was just a honest story about two peoples relationship. If you want a modern poem that talks about love, there is nothing better that this.\nLove is universal, but love in different circumstances and places is very different. The poem is strong and has a message of acceptance and how people must not judge others by what their circumstances are. The message is something that should be passed on.\nThe poem has a beautiful message and a very beautiful story to tell. I believe that the author felt so strong that we all had to believe the story. The poem is very well written and can be enjoyed by anyone.

{"prompt":"Write a story about a man writing a story about a man writing a story about a man writing a story .","text":"Write a story about a man writing a story about a man writing a story about a man writing a story. I love this quote because, after all, writers aren't going to write a story about themselves. When it comes to writing fiction, you must leave the author behind and forget that you've ever been anybody.\nMy first exposure to a short fiction writer was via A Day at the Races, by David Leavitt, the short story writer and Olympic speed skating medallist from Oklahoma. He has penned a number of other short stories, both fiction and nonfiction, as well as being a reporter for the American Spectator on speed skating. He also co founded the American Skating Writers Association, and he is a member of the National Speeder's Hall of Fame, which we celebrate today.\nHis short story collection We Were the Children came out in 2003. His fiction has won awards, such as the Iowa, Missouri, and Southern Writers Association awards, as well as the John Jay Gould, A. A. Milne, and Moby Dick awards. He has been published in several anthologies. He was also honored with the Robert M. Heinlein Award in 2001, given to the author with the most accomplishments in the field of science fiction.\nIf you've followed me for a while now, then you'll know that my favorite thing to read is an Austen novel. I've come to the conclusion that I will never be a \"professional\" actress at all, but rather a kind of professional writer, and for me there's a lot to be said for learning to appreciate a good short story.","token_len":329,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,2.0279,2.3894,4.1061,7.1797,1.0079,2.0111,0.5011,1.2235,0.9443,1.3329,0.3969,0.2527,0.0952,0.5882,0.4395,1.7135,0.2306,0.0745,5.0468,3.7147,3.7444,2.8056,5.8827,3.7235,3.9361,4.3872,0.8581,0.0867,6.4502,3.9977,0.0005,5.0832,0.127,1.8488,1.6917,0.5855,0.3965,4.4363,0.6565,4.6715,3.5562,0.1841,0.1166,1.2956,4.5511,0.1897,2.559,4.4647,6.5209,1.8468,5.4476,3.8133,2.3207,7.6421,2.9051,1.531,3.3582,2.2453,2.1135,9.3326,1.0642,1.3773,11.5624,3.1868,7.1988,0.0647,3.5837,6.8491,4.189,1.3905,0.7446,7.6663,5.9674,5.9408,2.417,0.5656,2.3395,1.2075,3.4343,3.8774,5.3234,4.1329,0.0199,1.4225,3.5122,4.5479,0.3529,2.0191,3.1574,9.6215,7.4001,4.5352,7.4597,0.2743,0.0009,2.7854,5.9442,0.9659,2.2054,4.1481,6.555,1.9207,2.0385,0.0017,4.4701,0.3435,0.2809,1.0607,5.2765,2.4979,0.0575,0.2992,0.5917,0.4933,3.5393,0.0354,0.0951,4.1963,1.0142,6.6463,0.5394,1.3616,4.5974,3.9437,0.0032,5.2053,7.3905,0.1146,0.6484,1.8189,2.3221,4.2671,10.8427,1.1917,3.6881,4.8521,0.7104,3.8831,0.5938,0.9332,1.7367,1.9723,1.8681,1.5399,2.17,0.0248,0.2448,3.2139,4.9998,4.4039,1.7761,4.1676,0.0208,0.0078,2.3093,2.0789,5.724,4.9237,4.8704,0.5394,0.9817,4.6458,2.1579,0.926,1.4079,7.1876,3.2646,3.5379,5.1874,6.3082,0.6113,0.5708,3.6245,1.0062,2.8938,4.5188,2.8629,3.4125,2.6816,2.0143,3.3451,0.004,1.0566,9.161,5.6526,5.1308,0.445,0.8177,5.2527,2.2451,3.6086,2.669,1.399,1.9852,0.0088,0.0115,1.2914,5.1294,5.1068,7.784,4.7955,5.8773,1.7558,4.8677,0.0408,5.0605,0.8363,0.7962,0.6794,10.2249,0.0669,0.7956,1.9132,0.3562,1.3585,1.4516,2.4423,3.6933,0.4936,3.0929,1.3746,0.0012,2.4723,1.4738,3.1186,2.239,3.9965,1.1113,0.5151,5.3755,3.4861,0.0848,3.9861,0.0009,0.637,2.3707,3.0232,1.7208,6.2497,0.6266,0.7827,3.0347,5.4556,0.6985,1.7704,7.4413,1.0528,2.243,1.141,0.9671,2.8704,0.0344,0.7284,0.9913,4.901,0.2299,2.5061,4.2182,1.5532,2.9217,1.1902,0.375,2.6661,0.146,3.6275,0.2185,2.2592,0.4784,0.62,2.5099,3.8655,4.0554,2.0549,2.7735,1.4073,4.3938,10.4663,0.8737,2.3748,1.9898,1.7987,2.1641,5.5453,0.3818,3.0138,0.2626,0.0964,2.1994,4.8191,1.7499,2.2155,2.0366,4.8112,5.7611,0.9567,10.2846,5.8943,2.265,1.1139,1.4131,2.9883,0.7839,4.5244,0.6479,4.576,1.7603,1.6691,2.0727,5.2393,4.0575,4.7815,1.4426,1.9212,2.5958,1.1336,1.9752,0.5581,0.25,7.2077,2.1095,5.3124,2.056,3.0872,3.8565,0.0381,0.765]}

For example a vampires bite might be the equivalent of the greeks\u2019 aneurysm, which they then call kouris, for \u201cblood of the gods\u201d.\nYou might also see the word for \u201csoul,\u201d which the Greeks called psyche (the English is the same way ), used for \u201csoul,\u201d while \u201cman\u2019s spirit\u201d and \u201chuman spirit\u201d could just as easily be another way of saying soul, but the Greeks put the words in the title when they were describing the soul from a scientific point of view, not when they were referring to the soul as something that a human being possesses.\nI think a more recent theory of Greek mythology might lead more people to believe that the Greeks just really didn\u2019t care much for animals (although some myths definitely did mention dogs, foxes, and a few other animals ).\nI\u2019m sorry this sounds harsh, but I think we have to understand that ancient human beings didn\u2019t have a lot in common with what we think of as humans in the 21st century.\nThis is why some modern scholars still refer to the Greeks as having been animals in the mind: they didn\u2019t have a very high concept of humanity, and the idea that they had a superior human spirit is completely laughable at this point in modern history.","token_len":329,"entropy":[9.8494,3.1316,12.5142,1.9179,7.7588,5.1857,4.4051,4.7117,0.0104,9.468,2.08,4.4301,0.4531,5.0527,0.3843,3.7287,2.4944,11.8891,2.2275,7.4784,1.1589,5.524,2.2322,1.4339,2.5053,4.2214,3.8482,2.9653,6.7358,3.6119,1.2342,2.5769,4.5732,5.6737,7.3547,1.8994,2.6957,2.0158,6.0148,3.6955,3.6363,3.6212,0.4385,2.9863,0.457,5.6776,8.8176,7.6004,5.3821,1.3946,3.9462,4.6059,0.0665,2.8721,6.6475,6.7197,1.6935,13.2426,7.4077,6.4085,10.4425,0.2383,0.3636,1.5942,2.7381,4.4228,4.9743,3.1059,4.8679,7.7943,3.8553,1.731,4.8489,10.7161,5.9994,6.487,3.544,1.5546,2.5941,1.9069,7.7579,2.6609,1.5699,9.2876,2.2951,1.7738,2.8428,2.357,3.8031,2.8474,5.7346,1.065,4.2189,2.1006,2.4856,5.1332,5.6893,1.5954,5.0367,3.4786,2.3051,10.6339,3.2478,3.6286,6.9401,4.7266,2.876,2.2769,1.6622,7.8482,5.3997,2.6018,3.9512,0.7686,2.9601,0.1718,2.354,2.1419,1.0873,6.0416,4.4883,0.3602,5.2812,3.9257,4.2129,5.1868,7.4069,4.6529,1.8001,4.1102,0.4889,0.0591,4.3849,4.2176,0.2025,0.1361,5.4702,4.9091,0.9276,0.4281,0.5074,6.7239,2.7669,0.4187,0.9231,4.6081,1.5058,4.3439,2.6034,2.6015,4.8611,1.6449,3.139,1.7464,2.1403,6.4189,6.2686,0.8384,2.8355,5.2856,1.3288,3.5962,5.6653,1.7778,5.3094,0.4222,0.007,0.0004,1.9393,3.4656,6.0487,0.6318,0.5475,3.2529,0.0233,1.0625,2.0596,2.3377,2.7938,1.6233,5.725,1.1086,1.1682,4.6812,0.4593,0.7776,4.4107,2.1591,4.0557,4.2559,3.9542,6.6158,2.6748,6.8646,0.9076,2.8178,6.6786,6.9798,1.1551,0.1505,1.9866,0.5767,1.4966,2.2947,5.7043,4.6944,2.8881,7.1978,2.5756,1.7068,2.0131,3.5152,1.6639,6.5469,4.3345,3.705,3.1792,6.2515,7.8864,2.8716,7.2841,5.7842,1.9385,7.3705,0.0408,0.2738,1.2435,4.2841,1.4605,0.5637,1.1285,5.1934,1.3802,2.3937,11.4111,0.3906,1.9593,4.4697,4.4694,4.9491,5.7776,0.7631,0.4806,1.1359,2.3378,2.9709,2.616,1.2047,4.5279,0.7847,6.99,4.6023,1.603,3.2747,0.2243,0.0484,0.0743,2.5832,1.8555,1.9712,3.0359,0.0133,0.0606,4.9559,0.8906,3.5521,0.3536,0.4092,4.2096,3.2402,1.5931,5.58,0.0045,0.1047,0.5499,1.874,4.0492,1.3059,2.3935,4.2681,4.3059,3.5508,5.1199,4.523,0.0196,1.5298,1.8748,0.1596,5.8154,3.4143,6.0381,3.4178,0.7829,7.0568,6.0006,1.6826,2.1143,0.2131,0.0286,0.0041,1.8091,1.5205,4.1097,3.2434,4.1549,0.0224,5.5388,1.5991,1.19,3.2097,1.9186,0.8148,1.4245,2.3747,1.5162,5.9153,3.7473,4.4452,3.2831,4.8554,6.126,4.1728,2.7258,0.0814,1.5735,5.222,1.7408,0.2012]}

Now, for the first time in history, we are all being asked to make our world a better place. Some call this the Great Awakening; some call it global awakening; some call it a shift of consciousness. The fact is that we are being asked to change our perception of the world. Now, for the first time in history, humanity is in the final stages of globalization. We have made it to the point where information is easily available 24 hours a day for everyone. The result of this is that we are no longer just thinking as a species; we are thinking as individuals.\nEvery time you do the check-in process using our mobile app on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device, you'll see the option to pay for your travel.

A magical dimension of truth\nWhen I was little I used to have one of these books\/dvd's with me at all times called \"Head of the Clan - The Secret of the Clan Tribe\" about some family of people who made a film of their clan and went to all this trouble just to have it shown. It was a great movie in many ways but I think they could have saved themselves the trouble and just put the documentary or the movie on YouTube and I believe it costs free on YouTube and anyone could have watched it. If you watched it would you say it was not worth it in some ways? I would rather they make a movie of their clan than put a documentary online. Not saying that they can't put stuff online like the new series of Game of Thrones but I don't know if they would do it. Sounds like they could have been a lot more creative in ways of making this movie a lot more interesting.\nYou could watch YouTube's version and watch it free and if you don't like it after a short while, you can just delete the video. That's how YouTube works. It's not worth it to watch and you won't regret it, either.\nYes you could have done that.

Taking the paper, you notice that it is a bucket list. It reads : \u2018 1. Eat a horse. \u2019 \u2018 2. Have an affair. \u2019 \u2018 3. Raise a horse. \u2019\nAs I grew up I was told that \u2018you only get a second chance to make a first impression. \u2019 To this day I find it difficult to believe that this saying has so many years.\nIt seems that \u2018first impressions \u2019 are no longer confined to human beings. If you pay attention, you will see that most animals, if you leave them alone, do exactly what they want. They don\u2019t listen or take advice.\nThey decide that they want to do something or walk around looking for an opportunity. And they don\u2019t hesitate.\nI remember the way that I used to see sheep just as they were being moved from the farm to the abattoir, knowing that I would be required to shoot them. Knowing in my heart that the shearer would just pull the trigger like nothing was wrong. I can remember the first of many shots, as the sheep stopped moving.\nAnd then the one animal that I was truly afraid of was the ewe, who was to be killed on the farm. She was gentle and gentle. She always sat like this, her lovely legs spread and resting in the grass. And when her throat was cut, she just stood and looked at me and went on eating. I suppose that made me feel a bit better about what I was doing.","token_len":335,"entropy":[12.2524,4.159,7.7382,8.3147,3.6967,0.4197,1.2024,5.7318,0.7513,4.2572,0.7343,5.152,0.0033,1.3736,3.3037,1.6541,0.9066,1.1545,8.3817,1.7962,0.7729,1.4569,1.3109,5.932,1.0205,1.1402,1.7592,2.3782,10.7301,6.063,1.6248,2.3461,4.5287,6.8262,9.5913,8.4787,5.5233,1.5729,6.1059,2.6897,8.8436,2.5369,1.6613,6.6233,4.3497,0.8414,0.0523,0.0009,3.6727,3.2594,3.8178,0.5175,0.0938,0.5235,0.1734,0.0831,0.0867,0.0015,7.4131,0.6809,5.151,0.2472,0.2001,0.171,3.3987,7.932,4.2883,5.4518,1.3955,2.2167,2.2243,3.3778,0.682,10.0841,0.6112,8.5895,4.6507,2.9848,2.711,6.0999,0.5441,1.9818,3.8158,1.2275,5.6336,0.6009,1.1857,3.9157,1.2664,5.6046,3.1568,0.0591,0.7883,4.3315,1.6289,2.3986,0.1234,1.6849,0.2847,3.3071,9.4698,2.4782,6.0163,1.0274,8.8486,5.0263,2.0051,3.7333,2.9506,0.7765,5.0906,0.1189,6.5007,0.3115,7.4108,3.4241,1.114,5.1401,0.5472,6.1001,0.0358,5.746,0.9318,0.4538,4.5531,0.97,7.4677,0.2698,2.193,0.4558,0.9246,1.2778,0.3028,3.895,3.9466,3.4146,4.4193,3.4404,5.0815,1.2173,0.4982,0.607,3.0405,6.785,0.7029,0.8136,2.0736,1.0193,2.3845,3.9475,10.3808,4.1917,0.1192,6.1215,3.8731,4.1837,4.8323,0.8503,1.8546,3.7583,5.4362,2.2666,1.3296,1.2997,0.3781,2.8659,0.9854,4.281,6.3364,2.4689,4.8714,0.3248,3.8341,1.343,0.9695,3.7143,1.8106,3.3331,0.3143,0.0933,0.0016,4.9948,1.4373,1.5503,3.2924,3.5828,3.0326,5.9449,2.1952,1.6527,3.6702,0.0082,4.1845,7.9872,7.1139,3.3467,1.8076,1.3089,2.212,5.1299,2.117,2.1936,3.3913,0.7606,0.3568,7.1852,0.3845,0.0002,2.9132,6.7821,0.3434,2.38,0.9024,2.1517,7.6855,0.0616,7.2997,0.8875,2.079,8.0166,6.4527,2.1376,1.2524,0.2247,2.865,8.0182,2.9628,1.0894,4.9798,5.5893,1.3067,1.8291,7.1553,5.7725,2.1543,1.9179,3.7567,2.6077,5.0639,2.3099,1.753,4.2133,7.9973,1.5901,5.8758,2.9451,3.5007,2.3912,1.3654,5.8412,1.8472,1.1073,0.9378,3.269,1.8206,2.1669,5.3683,8.2095,0.9935,1.9516,2.9433,6.3885,3.3331,0.3228,1.6976,0.7301,7.2872,2.3942,2.3349,3.9692,1.654,6.2074,1.4101,2.6201,4.267,1.3544,4.9219,0.6433,4.9551,1.0507,8.0939,0.9008,2.6575,1.5658,1.8161,4.6379,4.7513,6.5306,2.4333,1.3957,3.6709,7.5695,3.7526,2.377,3.3441,5.7881,2.6705,0.9393,2.6,0.5284,2.7517,2.1778,3.8784,5.9088,0.8588,1.6389,1.0958,0.9174,4.4281,2.2881,3.1244,2.0642,0.5047,0.2486,3.1052,5.2383,2.4192,5.2233,0.7839,2.5636,7.0359,1.3112,5.7984,0.9868,1.4424,2.7249,1.8367,2.4114,1.767,2.9867,1.0303,0.763,0.3897,0.4231]}
{"prompt":"An alternate history where dogs are wild animals and sea life has been domesticated .","text":"An alternate history where dogs are wild animals and sea life has been domesticated. In the wild the dogs are big. They can kill elephants, or go with a team of them to hunt down a buffalo.\nBut since sea water has become unhealthy, they are forced to go to cities. They live around the water, and they have changed shape.\nIf you were asked, what is a dog, what would you say? A cute puppy, that will run to your feet if you call him?\nHow do people like it? Well, according to my understanding, dogs like things to do. But don\u2019t forget that you cannot bring the dog with you on your trip in order to be there for it in case of any problem! How sad is that?\nDo you really know this? This is, unfortunately, a fact and the world does not seem to mind this. For example, in Israel, there are not even water fountains for the animals.\nLet\u2019s imagine that I have such a trip planned for the animals. And I hope that it will happen! First, I need to find a place where there is a lot of water. I will go to the nearest lake or a deep sea, after all, I will be there, the sea will be there.\nNow I just need to organize a trip for the animals. Where should I go? And how should I organize it? Let\u2019s see what options I have:\nThis is the most simple way of organizing the trip. People from everywhere find out, get into an organized group, go together and then bring the animals to the shore.","token_len":336,"entropy":[10.1396,5.1644,4.7344,9.9649,1.333,8.3967,2.2098,2.2851,9.0784,3.6033,3.6859,1.055,4.5007,0.0005,2.2115,3.334,1.7243,5.5703,3.512,1.6814,1.2386,7.3326,4.3831,1.6867,2.7214,5.8876,5.7752,0.8464,4.2019,5.1097,5.0088,2.8414,6.1595,0.6206,4.862,1.4704,1.8446,2.9644,2.446,6.6619,0.4676,2.4399,9.328,5.5244,5.4642,5.2495,2.2838,3.0155,8.2744,1.5935,3.2836,1.5257,3.3908,0.1128,3.2884,1.8789,6.1326,1.8858,2.4455,3.0402,6.0569,1.4888,3.9757,1.7259,1.6977,2.2203,2.5864,8.7424,6.4334,1.4134,2.0163,4.9816,0.9855,4.0544,5.5612,3.4795,2.2519,2.917,2.6901,1.3381,3.0745,1.0628,2.7673,0.5203,0.5608,0.4432,2.8762,7.2843,3.4926,1.6904,4.953,3.7147,5.6491,3.5983,1.8059,4.6387,4.0174,0.2321,4.342,2.3602,6.2777,1.7411,4.7382,1.7248,4.5119,4.9422,4.7974,0.7749,3.6514,0.2349,5.2077,0.0017,5.0764,6.3338,0.4097,1.801,4.2695,5.8751,2.8633,3.1587,1.005,3.8342,5.0647,16.1177,7.9673,0.4036,3.3424,1.4425,3.826,4.456,4.6446,3.9212,1.703,3.3575,0.0104,2.9493,1.947,2.2086,4.8804,2.4971,0.0564,3.7435,3.9655,3.2542,3.5962,5.4581,3.1227,1.217,3.5422,3.348,4.2038,5.9487,7.6618,1.6483,0.5672,0.8936,0.7612,4.4216,0.8625,3.3572,3.5523,4.9567,1.1375,4.5696,0.7834,6.2866,4.8743,0.0497,1.5776,3.84,4.6343,3.3474,4.2964,3.914,0.0651,3.9205,0.136,4.8227,4.5272,0.9755,5.4494,1.873,0.1781,2.3614,6.9312,0.7398,2.6151,0.9627,4.7715,2.9161,5.5905,4.7948,0.2254,0.0001,2.2425,2.464,2.6298,1.0864,1.5741,5.1438,3.8528,0.2277,0.758,4.9748,1.1888,4.4491,2.7877,6.3959,0.5596,3.9604,2.7932,1.548,1.6202,7.6049,1.1253,3.839,1.6647,5.439,0.6037,3.2001,1.3433,4.0809,4.1288,7.006,0.9205,1.1896,3.4456,0.4632,3.0525,1.0878,1.7216,1.6263,2.9467,0.9119,1.4723,4.5065,0.1059,0.6501,1.2002,1.9093,2.0167,2.4613,0.8878,1.0426,3.6549,3.4508,3.5391,2.6492,6.9683,1.9082,2.2892,7.0763,2.0752,1.4628,2.6524,1.874,1.6362,2.0893,4.079,5.3104,3.8339,1.3304,0.9782,3.0059,1.0436,1.211,3.9756,2.0918,5.6517,0.5881,0.2119,7.1879,1.9969,3.4494,2.5073,0.8204,0.5777,0.783,5.8784,3.4803,0.1296,0.6959,0.8061,4.5805,2.086,1.5359,0.0566,2.6977,1.6934,0.2001,4.0318,1.0857,0.0409,0.0231,3.1537,2.2161,9.0769,1.4324,0.4064,5.2862,0.5765,5.4703,0.7222,2.1028,2.8592,3.6312,2.1142,2.3865,0.2708,1.9721,0.3144,0.5192,6.0959,4.9501,3.9393,5.9593,3.8762,4.0411,5.6116,4.3567,3.9983,2.193,1.9862,0.8158,3.3033,4.3725,1.4397,4.3196,3.8507,1.4024,1.0546,1.9419,1.0049,4.3293,0.7275]}

Every person's birthday equals as their Fetish Day, when friends gather to fulfill this person's fetish. You can find them at all times, but they become more apparent around the spring solstice. Usually, the best sex positions are chosen in light of the person's preferred fetish. Some people choose a certain position because he or she is not a fan of their own genitals, some because they dislike penetrating their partner and others simply because one of them enjoys it.\nThere are many ways to satisfy fetishes. Fans of BDSM play their role on the couch. Some people get involved in their favorite fetish games. They enjoy sexual activities like bondage, nipple fetishes, fingering and even watching someone else play a role. Some fans of fetishes enjoy masturbation. Others prefer to play with sex toys, while others play with latex or rubber. No matter what you are looking for with BDSM toys, you will find it here! It is important to remember that a fetish is a way of life, which is why you will find it not only in a DVD store in Los Angeles, but also in your life. A lot of people in Los Angeles tend to live their lives through a fetish. Even if you do not believe in that, or do not share them, all you have to do is think about another person who is also in the mood to live his life. A lot of people in California want to get involved with their fetishes in order to express all their creativity.\nWe do not use cookies on this site.

You can\u2019t wait around for another business to do it, and neither can I. I decided to learn how to make money from home with eBay to help people like myself out. I quickly learned that affiliate marketing was a great way to earn money with eBay, and today I make money doing the same thing. It\u2019s just something you have to do and figure out, of course.","token_len":337,"entropy":[9.1178,12.6624,9.188,7.1628,5.2324,7.8635,3.0804,3.6473,1.0978,2.4836,4.9926,10.8404,6.0309,7.9551,7.4965,4.7165,2.2866,0.0003,6.3031,7.8772,6.148,3.973,0.2664,1.4447,1.7853,4.062,7.8678,0.3875,0.2013,2.2308,4.3682,3.5105,4.5555,1.9195,3.3734,3.6216,1.1903,1.8704,5.0623,5.4138,0.0322,4.8326,0.6567,6.8108,5.9712,2.684,1.3524,3.827,2.2318,4.3275,6.7478,2.6762,1.2624,1.7693,2.0665,3.1667,8.8715,1.9244,8.967,14.0218,9.0879,6.1373,2.8947,0.9438,7.3,3.3495,5.9636,0.332,6.784,2.9275,2.2429,6.6579,1.5773,3.7231,0.191,1.6151,5.1579,3.0659,1.672,5.2644,2.2777,2.1617,2.6214,0.008,1.7826,3.7264,2.1012,5.6226,0.1344,3.1895,2.221,4.4395,7.7783,0.9323,2.1987,5.0901,2.7466,1.8264,3.1037,1.866,4.5976,0.0359,1.0709,2.2066,5.3529,5.1029,5.9685,0.3351,5.1967,2.4488,1.8504,2.7602,5.8048,2.0747,1.3773,2.3545,0.6618,0.5684,2.4567,1.0303,3.9699,4.7747,3.6094,4.246,6.8922,1.8699,0.0089,1.092,1.0706,2.4878,1.8884,0.7626,4.9537,0.8762,4.3797,1.6632,0.5781,5.4468,2.5219,4.3576,3.9933,2.0402,0.5505,1.3158,2.5381,2.5986,0.0641,2.903,1.9639,3.2169,0.1781,2.9216,5.3553,4.134,1.827,1.4048,1.2645,1.4622,8.2453,1.404,1.4916,6.641,1.6686,1.1853,1.9935,2.2713,2.1293,0.9401,0.867,1.8925,0.5049,3.7775,15.5997,2.1053,0.2561,2.7286,2.6798,5.4388,1.275,1.5222,6.3683,1.7903,1.2895,4.913,6.6789,3.3835,2.0383,6.3227,0.3777,5.3915,0.1717,3.5843,3.0227,1.7951,0.5508,3.5811,5.6962,0.5562,5.8854,0.5256,5.9042,1.7473,0.9227,1.0961,0.1147,1.5434,2.3943,3.5032,1.4303,3.8493,2.6748,1.0922,0.5816,2.5367,4.5248,1.106,2.3598,0.2489,7.432,0.6198,2.317,2.1574,0.046,3.1213,5.1863,3.2751,0.4763,1.5169,3.8931,1.5744,1.9722,1.7884,2.1475,3.5977,4.9386,3.9533,1.0484,1.125,1.62,3.2669,5.9321,4.6226,0.0836,1.7692,7.8297,0.0457,3.165,1.5882,2.822,2.2538,6.5128,5.2102,0.3366,1.9716,0.6082,3.4559,2.4117,6.2156,0.1822,0.0777,1.5098,5.9242,1.1466,5.1788,7.3272,0.9118,4.6004,2.0843,2.5854,1.9287,8.8618,2.1231,2.6502,0.694,2.9775,6.8386,0.3495,6.1849,1.8114,0.2554,2.1824,3.2928,2.0208,7.2053,3.8846,9.7086,4.4827,1.882,4.0787,4.1465,1.4563,2.9231,1.823,1.7493,7.3409,2.4291,0.9787,10.4541,2.3035,2.5535,1.8897,1.9881,0.2496,0.1136,3.2534,1.3525,4.0027,2.2985,1.4237,0.6084,6.4956,0.8702,6.0078,2.6769,3.6395,3.6053,0.4346,1.6068,1.4533,3.3248,1.5425,0.0633,0.0101,4.1341,4.7324,2.3121,2.3571,0.015,1.0406,3.5317,7.088,0.0715,3.2416,6.3703,0.1296,1.1122]}

Is it the guard? Can his friend with the big mustache solve this problem for him? The courier goes out looking for the guard and finds a man with a mask and a big mustache. The courier recognizes him from seeing him in the vault. It is the Fugitive.\nThis is a very amusing story that you will see many times before you understand the true meaning. It is the first story in the book The Art of the Detective, which also contains other amusing stories. It must be read in the order of appearance : first The Courier on a Bus, then The Groom's Case and The Mystery of the Missing Glove. The main thing you need to know to enjoy this story is that it deals with very simple people. The Courier is a man who seems like any other average Joe. He's very short and fat. He is probably a good guy but he does have a little money to spend. He has also a little experience as a police detective after attending to night school.","token_len":339,"entropy":[12.2535,10.1916,1.3906,9.8669,6.8987,0.3348,2.076,2.0248,2.3705,0.062,0.0073,3.2744,0.9454,0.1,3.2239,0.8868,5.9913,2.36,2.5489,3.6657,7.2841,1.6818,7.4538,0.6362,0.7098,0.8438,4.6905,6.6143,1.9555,3.0722,4.56,3.4634,3.4457,3.7495,8.9937,0.2555,2.3092,6.1799,0.7558,2.7791,3.0142,4.5173,6.7351,2.3237,6.1906,2.5138,4.2815,0.5746,0.8787,0.3702,4.2631,2.3787,5.5841,1.2045,1.6645,4.1147,0.0014,0.9234,1.7094,0.9009,4.8427,0.1115,1.4814,1.0754,2.9623,1.5573,0.8927,2.8185,0.0075,0.8387,3.3455,1.0937,0.9578,3.6913,5.3393,0.5662,2.7274,2.6328,0.6165,1.6794,1.5855,3.1131,2.5174,1.8849,0.7784,1.1948,0.0006,0.2466,5.2553,6.707,0.3589,1.2061,2.3746,0.9106,0.8596,1.2137,8.1129,0.7677,1.2273,2.6155,5.9804,2.268,1.294,4.1086,3.8529,5.6604,0.4345,1.4239,1.5865,0.4381,3.7052,0.0968,2.4217,2.1266,4.1597,2.204,0.0002,0.669,3.0646,2.4655,0.3198,0.2699,5.6862,8.3543,3.0017,4.8245,1.1813,0.459,3.5467,1.7923,3.2395,1.2121,4.6004,8.392,3.8416,1.1355,1.1605,0.7652,3.4252,0.7655,2.2747,2.7436,1.4937,4.835,4.7482,4.856,6.0787,0.7889,6.7799,5.5601,6.577,1.5041,2.2,3.4664,0.2804,0.2099,2.1716,0.644,3.8623,4.2185,4.2129,0.1369,0.5247,0.6548,1.9557,1.3085,2.2989,2.1947,2.4805,0.5267,1.7078,2.4889,0.5342,3.4769,0.7693,0.795,1.117,0.783,5.5637,1.3597,3.6271,5.8303,1.1272,1.2943,0.3667,0.5576,1.0556,4.129,2.2229,1.1364,1.7843,0.0025,1.1982,3.0415,6.218,0.9427,2.0105,2.8828,6.5001,2.2022,3.597,3.6955,2.2928,2.5657,3.2647,0.1895,4.6925,2.2055,5.5798,1.6148,5.38,1.0594,3.6163,2.3124,0.9052,3.3292,3.2398,2.4684,1.7316,0.9823,3.0041,4.7687,7.2719,0.106,1.7954,3.4179,1.8132,2.1809,5.1173,2.2323,4.009,5.8805,0.7283,1.4077,2.5342,6.9064,0.5202,3.3039,1.9979,2.2964,2.64,2.2916,5.7594,8.7752,4.1101,7.3941,4.3353,5.7483,2.5399,6.8892,1.7245,1.5889,0.9386,6.0922,2.9906,3.8237,7.0064,3.3201,2.0821,5.0594,0.5779,0.6669,4.6757,9.6703,0.3894,0.7346,1.9175,5.0205,4.9705,2.4019,1.6822,0.0262,0.5516,3.358,3.8871,0.8957,0.5325,0.1767,0.4244,1.4209,5.7521,0.1767,4.9078,4.0921,4.7988,1.3267,1.7347,2.336,1.1651,1.4843,2.9609,1.1834,5.0945,2.9379,4.5635,1.0074,6.2492,5.5282,1.1207,0.5802,2.8476,3.193,5.2261,1.2997,4.9613,1.2558,0.4513,2.5379,5.2406,2.3061,3.4934,2.6436,2.8979,1.225,4.0763,1.2815,0.6658,4.1689,6.3552,2.3245,1.2181,0.8589,0.8308,2.0129,6.1411,1.9834,3.372,6.6679,2.8945,0.2268,3.2485,1.2766,6.9994,6.3284,5.7711,9.9253,7.1345,1.2433]}

{"prompt":"Tell me a tale about a rock .","text":"Tell me a tale about a rock. A rock that\u2019s hard enough to stop a bullet, but soft enough to be broken by its weight. I\u2019m sure you do it all the time, but it\u2019s true. What was so special about it? That story just seemed to fit for this morning\u2019s title, So Hard but Yet So Soft, but I\u2019ll tell you.\nI saw a picture this morning of a rock lying beside a pile of sand. There was an interesting rock and a simple rock, but they were of the same color and they were both there just in the right places. There was much to admire. And that one stone there wasn\u2019t enough to make a story in itself, but if two pieces of one thing combined, or three pieces of two things, or any number of pieces of many things \u2013 you became something much bigger.\nYou can imagine what a story could be if you put rocks on a beach and there are shells and things on there that only that beach has. Or if you have something very special in front of you and all of a sudden, the very thing you were looking at isn\u2019t that special anymore. It isn\u2019t that it doesn\u2019t look as pretty as it did before, but it is something more profound. The point is, you need all kinds of things in life to make a story, to make something interesting. You need a rock like the one that I saw on my morning walk \u2013 something ordinary and ordinary, but what if that rock were something special in our life? What if that thing we love the most, was a rock?","token_len":340,"entropy":[5.2722,3.965,7.0178,1.7688,1.8497,7.9662,3.9128,3.0822,2.37,1.7783,15.6621,7.2324,2.9339,3.9379,4.1103,0.353,6.5122,2.5217,3.6993,2.2995,1.098,3.3314,0.002,0.2066,4.5906,4.3525,1.958,4.6722,3.102,0.5939,3.4308,4.3731,0.8359,1.1512,3.4273,1.7591,5.4777,3.428,3.2251,0.5554,0.0896,1.2779,1.7203,2.4625,2.2365,0.102,0.163,7.0136,0.8233,5.1077,4.2305,3.9341,2.7217,0.0996,1.9544,0.8319,4.6108,5.9814,4.8368,3.9721,1.5302,3.9913,6.0352,3.1494,5.9842,3.0165,0.1087,4.5172,8.9697,2.6103,8.3921,5.7328,7.6825,10.281,2.0554,3.6389,2.3424,3.7067,2.9392,2.0666,0.0385,3.9225,1.5107,0.1524,4.1035,2.3624,6.2248,5.1095,1.9112,3.7949,5.6979,0.0988,1.085,1.158,2.2523,5.6117,5.2243,0.8831,4.2606,0.0517,4.4064,0.9183,4.3159,0.609,3.6398,4.9906,5.1621,4.5722,1.5984,6.5373,3.0459,1.6156,1.3998,3.5126,0.8864,5.7504,1.8769,0.2232,3.1761,2.1078,4.4065,0.8043,2.8312,6.2981,4.7596,2.5873,1.0784,1.9037,1.3666,0.4504,3.63,0.5632,6.7671,2.4025,2.5857,2.1818,3.5058,3.2313,5.2531,6.1201,6.5779,4.4342,1.5136,0.2042,0.6094,5.4203,0.7905,2.6443,1.9315,3.6999,5.2043,1.8986,1.4279,1.0294,4.2935,7.4703,4.0726,0.7248,5.5278,3.5042,5.5849,1.4068,5.1003,4.3914,0.7297,0.6919,4.0297,0.2647,3.3383,2.6698,4.7548,1.4894,0.0589,2.169,1.1932,5.418,0.7918,6.8843,3.5405,8.639,3.3256,4.7989,1.9409,0.9507,1.2099,3.5845,2.8386,3.4671,2.134,2.414,1.2066,3.3588,0.6931,2.072,0.9672,3.616,8.0567,2.6219,1.4184,5.8907,1.406,5.6577,4.4462,9.9054,2.7357,4.6619,2.5856,4.8183,1.6596,5.8146,6.3398,4.4209,2.5458,1.3765,4.1059,1.1407,0.4408,4.2309,4.1424,4.8899,2.7243,2.4972,3.9957,0.0102,0.297,2.0946,4.9864,1.3255,0.4672,0.0001,2.1848,3.0446,6.5248,2.6168,0.8887,1.9919,1.2532,0.8938,4.7639,1.4064,0.1183,0.008,4.8916,2.6523,3.2779,0.5578,2.3163,4.0212,0.7211,0.0238,0.0053,1.81,4.0717,3.7326,1.1185,0.0142,0.0113,2.3184,3.4468,6.1022,0.6227,0.9711,0.8233,2.1673,1.5069,0.6563,0.7357,2.1293,3.5358,3.805,6.4171,0.9413,3.8138,5.9915,0.8009,0.926,2.1174,4.3515,5.7875,3.591,0.0025,1.7984,1.9032,4.3772,1.0034,1.9381,1.1826,0.4045,1.7793,3.9163,1.1344,2.6485,4.0238,0.8994,2.559,0.6918,2.533,3.1485,4.7464,3.794,0.1892,1.9334,1.8432,1.3356,3.3273,2.3486,3.8415,1.304,5.8152,4.1427,8.4663,1.2795,3.6047,1.3915,1.7288,5.101,4.0108,3.0313,0.2268,2.6914,3.0938,2.5179,3.7299,6.3151,3.31,0.7143,1.817,0.2531,1.6795,5.9025,4.8735,5.6309,4.2142,0.0399,2.6148,4.5036,2.7168,0.5815,3.8806]}

It would not have been the life, nor would it have been the happiness that I have now if it was not for my parents who had to struggle with raising me.\nI know other posters here are sharing their own stories....and what they chose to make their last days in life worthwhile.\nSweetie.. I'm with you on this. We are in a unique position to make a difference in the lives of our family...Our kids. I love that more then anything. Life is too short...Don't think more of it. Make the most of your family and you, I will. :)","token_len":340,"entropy":[5.9155,8.9854,1.8034,5.0473,1.2067,7.9729,12.7174,2.1198,5.0217,5.7385,0.1719,4.1914,0.9859,10.0724,1.7104,9.6304,4.6613,5.6671,3.9688,5.0127,3.4632,2.6084,2.0071,1.7595,2.7509,3.6414,3.0211,0.9117,3.2619,5.3382,5.9811,3.2628,1.2974,0.6996,0.9837,6.8789,2.7587,1.3442,4.0948,1.3013,2.1742,1.402,1.1759,1.0547,0.9216,4.4565,1.8379,2.1262,0.4982,6.4095,2.413,1.4768,5.9915,5.4006,2.3569,5.4063,0.8413,0.5548,0.2987,4.7459,1.0419,0.5138,1.0611,2.0466,1.443,1.8582,0.8,2.4772,6.4586,5.5827,3.6369,2.0802,4.3496,0.4176,0.3022,0.2478,2.1365,2.3697,3.7651,3.6438,1.5036,3.5909,3.014,1.1948,5.6807,1.1911,5.3251,6.3784,11.6382,1.4252,3.1976,2.0986,2.0514,1.7777,4.9875,4.5599,2.8416,2.008,4.3172,1.8041,1.1289,7.1913,5.9305,1.3876,2.5757,6.2868,0.2461,3.6961,2.6357,0.0086,1.1106,1.8477,2.2978,1.9378,2.2757,4.4216,1.5283,4.7112,5.0649,3.4168,3.8179,1.1547,0.5132,3.0642,2.4201,2.1355,2.6786,0.5412,2.475,3.4556,0.2346,2.3924,1.3776,1.1326,4.0764,0.0014,3.8918,4.1112,6.9695,2.8394,1.134,2.1876,3.6939,0.3912,3.3626,0.5331,3.7163,6.2265,0.6046,0.6189,2.5465,0.6324,0.4931,4.5811,1.682,4.3688,3.6611,1.1058,6.1577,2.6717,0.5944,0.2495,0.7189,1.3686,3.5612,5.0669,0.3332,1.7308,1.9069,0.2318,3.3241,4.8774,0.5667,1.8409,2.5722,3.1163,4.4806,0.6583,1.1918,2.6405,2.9116,3.8204,1.2178,0.5447,7.2421,1.2786,4.9465,2.4076,1.8555,2.4171,0.9941,3.0822,0.4582,0.9816,1.5378,3.9816,3.4325,6.0381,0.2743,1.0938,0.9124,6.1156,3.0054,1.286,0.5728,2.359,3.9478,3.6161,0.3062,2.0603,1.2554,3.3984,0.7899,1.1152,2.0679,4.0907,1.1879,1.9808,6.2281,3.2442,1.0014,0.4339,3.5404,4.7381,7.164,4.8136,2.7917,0.3013,1.4446,0.2106,0.6133,3.7805,2.179,0.4641,2.6758,1.856,2.928,2.3263,2.7206,0.7654,0.0941,1.4343,3.0165,3.1292,4.312,3.8496,5.8703,1.3757,6.5286,0.3493,1.2819,0.9338,1.1716,3.4795,7.2806,11.1142,4.1873,2.2133,6.0081,1.4807,2.0496,0.9969,9.2361,3.3914,5.0108,1.4678,6.9873,0.2571,5.5722,3.0179,6.4834,2.6223,3.4025,2.0279,7.2304,0.7012,2.1147,9.183,4.06,6.4188,2.684,2.1627,5.6617,0.5509,3.6414,0.4578,2.4557,4.3581,1.791,3.4483,2.3151,4.7642,2.0192,1.4022,2.4686,1.9332,0.5526,1.3538,1.0355,0.6406,0.0432,2.4513,4.2432,4.8107,7.3174,3.3495,1.9744,2.8331,2.9627,3.3808,6.6117,5.964,0.9781,1.3524,6.1129,0.6592,3.8278,0.4091,4.6115,6.9367,0.0315,4.0759,6.7879,2.4346,1.4949,0.8821,4.6728,2.782,1.4232,0.1305,1.6449,5.2572,2.3484,3.535,6.4053,6.183,2.4213,1.8619,6.7052]}

It is given to the deceased when they enter Hell based on the sins they committed while they are still alive. You just arrived at Hell and Lucifer congrats you as richest $ inner. You were a very big $ inner and will continue to remain so.\nA small $ ins is only given to people when they die by God. This is the same for humans and animals. Since your job at least for you is to destroy and kill you have all the $Ins you need to survive. Your mission now is to fight back. You have no business in Heaven or Hell you are the one and only true soldier of God. Now you are in the thick of the fight.\nWith every dollar in Heaven or Hell, God created another angel in heaven and another devil in Hell to help you. You are so rich you can afford anything. You can travel to another planet if it fits where you belong. No need to worry about food or medicine. No need to concern yourself with any form of hardship. You are blessed in heaven and hell. Your job is to destroy and kill. Death no more, it is too expensive now. That is why you are the winner in here. You have everything and are the richest in the world.\nWhat is the difference between the devil in Hell and the angel in Heaven. As a soldier and a soldier of Satan what is the difference between you and an angel or a devil. You are the only difference. You do not make the difference in the world. There are differences between different countries, different religions, but not between the devil and the angel. Satan does not need angels and demons. He needs soldiers.","token_len":342,"entropy":[12.1218,8.9531,1.7467,10.2487,2.3946,4.6207,14.9168,3.2816,4.1563,1.0956,5.7747,1.2775,1.4269,6.3683,3.736,1.7174,5.2097,2.169,10.0421,0.1431,1.0386,7.4632,2.076,1.0818,4.2252,2.6442,1.23,2.4094,0.1825,0.3839,4.8039,6.7292,10.9146,1.1819,1.083,1.9633,10.3706,12.5837,0.0042,1.1321,5.9305,12.2659,7.6213,8.9961,4.8242,2.4125,4.0141,3.2753,4.065,5.8125,4.3437,2.4815,2.5315,4.3851,3.6198,0.1861,6.4164,0.8648,1.5561,1.956,7.5011,5.2928,4.0428,0.8475,2.938,5.54,1.7394,0.66,2.9977,5.2285,0.4089,1.6795,5.527,3.9783,1.1821,2.4767,0.874,2.5198,3.2689,2.6521,5.5285,2.1522,2.3398,0.4319,6.4855,4.5551,6.4872,4.8643,4.917,5.7768,3.9768,0.8292,0.417,5.8387,4.0253,2.7031,4.5354,7.6263,5.358,1.1788,5.3332,8.459,1.9075,0.7899,1.0345,2.3281,1.1116,4.2246,5.1559,5.2834,0.1939,0.2013,5.4788,3.8446,2.0144,2.118,2.1518,2.8483,4.3371,3.8673,4.6755,3.2998,0.2114,5.2196,1.4645,3.7327,2.9826,4.8774,0.1726,5.3135,7.8739,1.5631,1.4746,0.5177,4.6799,1.8108,1.4583,3.3104,2.3332,5.2966,0.0247,1.6717,2.6161,1.3026,1.515,5.7686,4.1909,3.8814,3.4904,4.0919,3.2187,0.0542,2.8615,4.6581,5.924,5.5356,5.611,4.0007,2.5157,2.255,7.0096,5.7878,0.3634,3.8592,2.7569,3.102,0.4755,1.6439,2.211,1.5634,5.9461,3.289,2.0557,1.7699,2.8364,6.689,1.6337,1.5962,2.2012,5.5367,1.5406,4.2138,1.4494,4.2312,4.1172,5.9758,7.7152,0.1511,6.9288,0.5617,4.9984,2.6827,0.2404,2.0611,0.4459,6.0633,1.2769,4.051,0.6822,3.3292,0.8155,0.0943,7.2155,0.248,0.4458,4.3302,5.8197,0.0085,7.2727,0.4854,1.4101,1.4622,4.9448,3.244,2.5344,1.4234,3.5562,0.878,3.2855,3.7883,0.9454,0.3366,2.4993,1.4753,0.2454,2.8743,7.095,7.1865,3.6681,3.3636,3.6358,0.6547,4.9457,7.2938,4.5119,0.6815,5.4529,0.7283,1.0987,0.6783,1.3008,3.8254,6.5685,2.7461,8.3295,0.5089,1.7857,1.8766,4.3864,3.3776,3.4504,2.5528,4.1602,3.642,0.8948,0.6305,0.218,1.7177,4.7591,1.8662,1.6421,2.6629,0.1285,2.15,5.5388,3.6626,0.9774,0.1251,0.6227,1.4288,0.1917,0.7153,3.764,5.2063,2.5578,5.7196,3.3042,1.0952,2.3092,0.6804,7.3567,7.0569,0.9081,0.7107,0.0147,0.8701,2.0385,0.3157,4.937,0.0877,4.6554,1.6917,1.6193,2.3861,2.4047,0.8353,1.5664,2.4668,6.9754,0.9911,1.5982,4.0949,0.2455,5.3513,2.4243,1.3406,2.4464,2.0376,1.0257,0.911,4.5771,1.2869,5.2128,1.8818,6.1639,4.8497,2.2873,3.0387,1.8572,0.7541,5.0367,4.7835,2.5865,2.1711,1.7399,0.8687,1.2184,0.386,0.9427,3.191,2.9896,0.1094,4.0921,4.177,2.4625,2.88,1.2429,1.1682,1.8557,5.7087,1.6677]}

I did so to let the readers know the new things I wanted and to let the others know if they have something to add.\nAt the first glance, there is nothing to worry about but a story about a murderer who can\u2019t tell the truth. It\u2019s a nice, short, simple book with clear goals while the plot doesn\u2019t change much from the first book: the plot revolves around keeping the truth alive in the world. We don\u2019t need to be reminded that we live in times where the media and internet keep us hooked on the headlines. The main focus is keeping the truth alive in people\u2019s minds. And since the main character doesn\u2019t get any support from the media or people who tell the truth, we know that the main objective is not to expose a person\u2019s secrets but to keep them alive.","token_len":342,"entropy":[4.9519,8.0145,1.9315,7.7403,0.1042,2.0917,7.038,0.008,9.8954,2.8907,6.7484,4.5619,1.7991,1.382,0.7659,4.6911,8.1242,11.0877,1.957,0.1408,6.6654,4.2131,1.4099,5.6975,2.4566,12.9061,0.07,6.8739,0.1628,2.6864,0.1585,9.2267,1.2075,1.7539,7.998,3.8709,0.4133,5.0447,0.5867,3.6229,2.0016,1.6298,1.2001,3.0805,1.3211,1.0266,4.594,3.0029,0.6887,3.294,6.8043,3.2711,0.9856,1.7181,3.97,3.191,2.9224,4.0765,0.0953,2.7723,1.8032,6.0384,2.2168,3.2537,7.4024,1.3405,0.1245,2.624,7.3268,2.6401,0.9445,1.3235,1.7151,0.4428,4.9429,2.0341,2.2083,3.998,0.8995,2.9975,0.7789,4.1043,8.4566,0.8244,1.9813,3.4541,3.645,2.9015,8.3091,3.0111,3.1868,2.2277,1.317,1.9872,9.673,2.2866,0.5446,4.4757,1.9134,3.6679,1.127,5.9196,1.3713,3.8312,0.4144,3.9799,3.6464,1.058,1.7829,3.3515,5.8449,2.5639,2.5187,1.9374,5.4845,2.3157,3.9188,4.9388,0.1457,0.3394,2.1321,0.0563,0.1387,1.4487,8.5367,1.4186,1.1023,0.0586,8.6356,4.6411,0.3043,1.8613,3.5614,1.9016,0.3347,2.0587,1.6957,5.1013,11.1392,6.4406,3.1085,8.5272,0.0378,11.1828,0.1957,8.6978,3.1388,0.1482,2.8799,2.1671,1.1848,3.7876,3.9109,2.8417,2.766,1.6594,4.481,2.0134,6.4842,2.9864,0.3932,4.0964,1.1482,1.6139,4.1934,2.2277,3.4223,4.8214,1.4723,1.7135,0.1953,3.8617,3.2296,6.169,1.0093,3.4954,5.9337,1.9504,3.0497,2.0125,6.5599,0.0714,4.9701,1.1645,3.5006,4.7766,1.4377,0.8067,0.7905,1.3739,4.6744,0.472,6.5678,4.7368,0.2041,3.4757,1.207,2.25,2.4069,3.8309,0.006,6.382,2.7501,6.2156,2.214,0.9411,3.7246,1.1684,4.8793,15.8439,8.924,1.3956,3.2266,1.2915,0.9092,0.8614,2.9152,4.8088,0.8904,0.2258,1.5263,6.3668,2.9802,4.7597,2.5857,3.8151,2.5154,3.1391,6.3601,2.8283,7.8232,4.0702,3.2361,3.7076,0.7261,1.5733,0.0341,4.329,1.819,3.2615,1.119,2.4609,2.4484,5.8121,3.4806,4.7556,3.0078,0.0086,8.4228,1.407,5.6525,3.8686,3.2859,1.46,3.3615,1.5146,4.7774,2.7624,0.0774,0.4937,0.0093,2.5961,0.549,3.299,4.5539,1.3398,2.9653,3.5317,0.1017,7.5832,2.524,2.05,4.0765,2.12,6.9134,4.2875,2.5364,7.1567,1.1305,1.8108,6.5896,1.6515,2.255,3.651,3.2109,1.1114,4.1023,0.7489,1.8711,0.3255,1.8523,5.6163,1.7472,0.1003,0.3497,0.8912,0.9136,4.215,5.1778,1.5719,3.6274,3.7187,3.1034,0.0634,0.0383,0.0099,4.8293,2.3096,7.049,0.6383,0.829,1.0532,1.9085,4.0956,1.969,6.5278,1.4862,0.3656,0.2869,2.1871,4.1662,0.9798,1.5882,2.5408,4.9282,0.6157,3.1161,0.5893,5.3072,3.8859,3.4618,1.6244,0.0119,0.1961,4.9189,1.3081,0.1973,1.1742,1.5306,1.1914,0.7978]}

It's easy enough, with the first one saying he's a Godfearing man and the second having him calling you a devil worshipper. Then you get a third one, saying it was the Devil who led you to do it, so that makes you the Devil, anyway. Just shoot him in the face.\nIf you ever want to level up fast, don't just keep shooting. Look for hidden loot, but don't just shoot every place just to get that gold. Remember the first rule - don't just shoot.

Remember when we're talking about not just shooting ; you're the new Death, so you must learn how to play by the rules.","token_len":342,"entropy":[3.8828,11.3838,2.8975,5.2458,7.9988,0.4665,2.0811,0.8441,7.9403,1.4334,0.2452,1.0404,5.4529,2.3162,2.4378,10.1169,3.9622,5.2688,2.895,3.4144,11.2238,3.1657,2.586,4.5913,3.788,0.3188,4.0131,4.6661,5.9541,1.4264,1.218,2.3382,2.8093,4.1679,0.0607,1.8163,3.3723,0.4478,7.3455,0.6441,3.8486,3.0614,3.1131,4.5581,3.4931,5.3903,5.196,4.4935,3.9206,4.2894,2.3766,6.767,7.6189,4.4267,4.9922,8.2339,3.2532,1.6569,9.5427,16.3079,2.7335,2.1069,1.6767,9.0237,0.0978,0.2009,0.6334,3.3811,2.8707,1.7881,3.409,3.2516,1.7838,1.5534,4.7484,0.0858,0.9974,1.8167,2.0416,4.3736,0.0065,3.5036,4.3049,3.2717,1.3926,1.2356,1.7389,1.9624,2.457,3.9476,2.7478,5.6655,6.4603,1.2982,5.786,4.8504,0.0804,0.9133,3.3631,7.5179,0.8748,2.2414,1.5939,1.4651,1.4883,8.3218,7.5345,0.3228,1.1946,3.4286,7.5404,2.5228,3.1747,0.4459,3.1026,4.5727,2.1928,1.1898,5.4897,7.7115,2.1045,5.6618,1.7937,1.4222,2.1117,4.2814,7.4473,0.0053,1.5635,3.0893,1.4646,5.0247,1.1899,2.826,5.2463,0.656,0.5596,1.0717,2.5345,1.3942,0.9969,3.7724,6.0627,10.9595,9.6521,8.1414,2.3895,2.2047,0.5654,7.0089,0.1829,2.6019,10.9581,2.4814,2.2894,3.5381,4.3451,6.5377,8.8851,7.786,1.1308,3.7283,2.0365,3.2937,1.5649,3.5625,0.5861,4.6439,1.5154,2.0392,4.9669,1.7455,5.8409,3.7124,5.7861,3.9414,1.0163,3.0686,5.1533,6.0294,4.5738,4.0953,2.9357,1.4159,0.517,5.2152,4.349,5.7105,1.0827,0.9752,3.7556,6.6678,0.4415,0.8409,4.0888,1.4586,3.4032,2.2899,6.4497,1.4006,1.6479,2.7254,3.7489,2.9972,2.8019,1.495,1.9248,5.7432,0.797,0.6467,5.1067,2.1466,1.1571,2.8596,3.5104,5.643,1.7109,2.4254,1.8404,2.7866,6.8799,0.2328,4.8556,4.6494,0.7152,3.4109,0.1739,1.2104,1.694,1.4249,3.1805,0.3144,5.5072,2.7702,0.1927,6.6992,0.2999,5.9091,0.9478,4.3042,0.0006,4.0081,4.7736,2.3144,2.1758,5.5875,1.2921,5.8882,4.7866,1.6354,4.4812,1.2616,0.0002,3.3373,2.9046,4.5435,6.639,7.0186,0.8879,1.2425,4.3286,5.1334,0.7673,4.7869,2.9716,3.1148,4.2039,2.9583,2.0903,0.0005,3.5442,1.4803,3.0544,2.7846,5.0399,1.7097,4.3713,0.5167,0.1257,1.192,3.4195,4.1907,7.7188,0.7439,1.5214,3.6378,0.3107,0.4515,0.1294,0.6116,5.9885,3.5579,3.6624,6.9733,2.3174,3.9707,3.7894,4.5327,3.6686,1.1401,7.838,1.1744,5.3397,0.9829,4.4702,5.8009,2.0684,5.2357,0.8365,3.2213,3.0358,2.7352,3.6973,1.0564,4.48,4.8797,3.7907,5.5048,0.6891,0.1902,6.4565,1.8871,4.9657,6.8011,1.1941,2.6797,5.2711,6.5844,4.5144,1.7483,1.9358,1.4281,4.0133,2.6294,1.5304,0.0211,3.787,5.0708,1.7736,0.5246,0.8858]}

{"prompt":"A man gains the amount of people in the world as money on his account .

And it can be reversed also i.e. He can die, and get the money from a different person also. I believe in the concept of reincarnation. I was raised in an atheist family. But I believe in god. I have been to my first temple in my whole life today. I feel more comfortable in temples than anywhere else. It creates a safe space for people like us. To express themselves, we were not told what to write. We just felt very comfortable and had a good time, even on a small scale. I have seen some sort of a book of records there. It says we have to send money to the temple as we have done in the past. And they keep record of what is the current amount there. They make a report and publish that. I would like to contribute to this book of record to show how the masses believe in god. How do people go to temples and pray for themselves and their children. To have such a belief is very deep, and has to be there on a profound level. People can go to temples and be very spiritual and have a relationship with God,but in the middle of their journey they go to a doctor and have a relationship with her. The fact that people believe in God is real, but the beliefs in modern medicine aren't. This has become a social norm. People are sick and go to a doctor first before they go to a temple. Because they see a doctor as trustworthy. Why should we go to a temple before going to a doctor? How do people think this is happening?","token_len":343,"entropy":[7.3022,9.7412,3.471,10.0835,0.1305,7.8504,2.7403,1.3014,3.1386,4.7861,6.7321,5.2715,2.1964,4.5687,1.3071,3.6691,3.203,1.5029,5.1038,3.6019,0.2883,1.3185,4.7424,5.2303,0.5528,2.4792,2.948,4.5736,1.0896,8.0335,8.6931,11.6117,0.1678,0.0037,0.2841,5.4606,1.544,5.8541,3.3951,2.4144,4.5607,2.1229,0.52,3.4326,3.3964,3.3042,1.4531,7.1275,0.5657,4.4135,3.4223,2.5622,2.0723,3.6998,0.1961,4.8171,0.0124,1.1478,2.1339,5.8059,3.3704,1.059,2.8918,5.1257,1.8371,1.1083,3.1331,1.2849,2.4124,0.8306,5.9678,1.1547,1.2557,3.4168,2.6,3.7232,5.27,2.5152,3.2427,2.1286,3.7327,4.1045,0.0294,8.8531,0.5806,1.1826,4.4487,5.3994,2.8206,1.8766,7.3553,1.7036,3.1369,0.1809,0.7821,3.1903,7.0822,1.0978,5.6821,0.8746,0.8825,1.7441,4.1099,4.057,1.1672,5.5305,6.2574,4.9897,2.2026,2.41,5.6448,3.9437,3.83,3.0697,0.4089,6.2909,1.1312,1.0716,3.5344,3.5575,5.8338,1.5466,2.8,4.2475,1.3454,2.306,0.4263,3.5896,3.2618,5.0723,2.3159,3.6931,1.8736,0.2617,2.2053,2.9555,3.6809,3.2096,7.3091,0.0037,4.8012,6.9768,3.7788,7.7533,5.2185,0.8873,2.2621,3.7168,3.4579,2.3456,3.2064,5.7835,3.5207,0.7685,1.6818,1.7042,4.8145,2.665,2.847,2.5105,1.6556,1.3326,0.1341,0.3819,2.7935,4.1502,5.1862,6.5336,0.4079,2.6202,3.3901,4.4614,5.608,2.8624,6.1836,0.3542,3.3241,4.3842,2.0364,4.1222,2.616,5.5894,2.9234,1.4587,2.2814,4.0682,1.1558,0.1839,7.4133,1.0962,1.8837,2.2991,4.0841,2.252,3.5417,2.5688,1.9818,3.129,7.8939,5.1376,0.6142,2.1386,0.6592,5.3719,3.311,3.157,4.7312,1.578,0.855,1.8771,3.0501,2.1924,5.8561,1.8303,2.4337,1.7817,1.4696,4.2814,3.5876,4.0791,0.7831,5.9634,2.4938,2.4517,7.9301,2.6499,1.56,4.8236,2.6245,0.5325,5.2508,4.767,0.7973,7.5258,0.104,0.3572,3.9108,3.1898,2.8642,0.5001,0.8444,1.0933,4.7333,2.5921,3.5403,1.8688,2.6992,1.2669,6.2237,0.2155,0.8196,2.2529,9.8499,4.0489,1.74,4.6856,0.5962,3.1618,2.7523,1.2659,3.9565,0.5714,1.5256,7.2988,1.7142,1.9659,1.0004,4.5771,0.1585,6.2886,0.6455,3.2974,5.4349,0.4746,2.6421,3.1572,0.3851,1.9997,1.3402,6.2991,1.8282,2.4566,2.8318,6.5055,3.134,7.9773,3.3869,5.1211,0.0014,0.7962,4.2318,3.8562,3.9386,1.2647,5.6261,4.8272,1.1835,2.1389,1.4592,5.1244,1.3975,6.2108,0.2706,2.6723,0.7689,7.2506,4.141,1.0362,0.4934,0.0618,0.721,0.9105,0.531,5.5726,2.4423,4.484,2.1326,0.8075,3.7039,7.2416,1.4359,5.6132,2.4753,2.4191,3.0433,0.1906,0.6755,1.493,5.3847,3.5356,0.0538,0.4885,0.6244,0.2553,4.8245,1.6589,2.1968,3.8145,4.4204,1.0852,5.3476,0.3927]}
{"prompt":"Other than personal preference , how do you select which prompts to write ?","text":"Other than personal preference, how do you select which prompts to write? Just randomly choosing them?\nThat way you give your mind a chance to break up, and to see what goes on in your mind when you are at your writing point\nYou can also make things difficult for yourself by giving yourself a choice of 3 prompts or 4, then 4 or 3, repeat till you get the point. In this way, you can keep things interesting for yourself and also challenge yourself to get it right.\nAs for my preferred style, I tend to write straight-to-thenature, and I get that for my free-response prompts as well - I have a lot of difficulty working up ideas for things I need to say, if the topic is not something I personally like and haven't thought about in a long time.\nIt's easier that way. Once an idea has cropped out, I can then go from there, having developed some thoughts, some context and a good grasp of the topic.\nAnd in the last week I have thought a lot about the theme of my next piece for the Creative Writing Forums... a short piece dealing with the notion of art, artifice, and the importance of being able to distinguish the two.\nMy father told me not to worry about what I think. As a person who is in a profession where we are expected to produce something artful, I am prone to think and wonder a lot about the purpose of our work. How to define and explain your contribution, in its true sense, to something as deep and profound as our existence? I want my writing to speak to that aspect of me that has a certain tendency towards mysticism and religious devotion.","token_len":343,"entropy":[6.5712,8.3831,5.2676,0.3391,5.3328,1.8123,0.5513,6.0804,1.7738,10.8681,1.0268,6.3024,1.5284,6.8684,7.9764,4.289,3.9914,4.4613,1.2896,11.1318,5.7364,1.4322,7.259,2.0755,4.4941,1.2313,1.2114,0.0791,6.8332,4.957,4.9723,1.6432,3.2077,3.033,1.2985,4.3384,1.5748,1.1521,0.3475,1.9424,2.1958,0.442,2.5107,5.0183,1.8551,6.4963,4.9883,6.0392,3.5239,1.5235,1.7307,4.0673,5.0862,4.9408,0.8248,0.4204,1.2804,3.3508,1.6252,1.4925,3.5258,2.0291,5.6141,2.0916,3.7603,2.7185,2.4199,4.037,5.6864,2.6736,2.5238,1.8325,7.9684,6.4991,0.2122,1.3264,2.6559,5.2606,2.5817,4.5449,1.7318,0.5395,1.4219,0.5116,1.1346,4.5791,4.075,3.6193,2.2476,2.8769,1.7053,4.4733,7.0224,0.2527,0.7712,3.3336,4.1691,0.6159,0.6008,0.6711,4.5745,2.3297,4.0178,7.1466,5.9675,1.1225,0.65,4.514,0.0375,1.4994,7.2324,3.795,4.1395,0.0204,10.3292,14.1347,1.5707,2.0564,1.6103,5.2148,3.2709,4.5287,2.4972,6.1208,2.9501,6.4472,3.4107,3.9382,0.1135,4.9623,1.914,3.4685,2.0814,2.6778,0.2258,5.7874,5.0909,4.592,4.852,2.0996,3.5411,1.5439,3.5917,0.3084,3.5058,1.5027,6.3511,4.0744,4.3968,0.9569,2.7844,3.963,0.7712,5.3038,1.7403,3.8103,6.1601,0.0003,2.6353,1.1906,3.1943,0.7473,1.3368,0.0763,0.3316,0.7595,4.1148,1.0311,5.2766,6.0342,0.0041,2.2824,5.7646,7.1018,0.5225,1.3779,8.4643,5.5738,0.93,1.3447,1.8144,3.3102,3.5075,4.8185,0.3744,1.6538,6.057,6.9776,3.1361,4.5312,2.0439,6.6692,6.3091,2.0103,2.6539,3.3232,3.7045,0.5955,1.1763,1.9591,0.9364,0.8759,3.7998,4.3243,1.9393,4.4173,4.6613,1.8657,1.6672,5.381,2.3901,0.2071,0.2463,2.2295,5.5638,1.0042,2.8893,3.3382,5.1986,4.8491,1.8109,8.518,0.975,7.6906,4.8443,5.5017,4.7816,2.79,6.4677,0.0649,1.72,6.5065,0.2364,6.2149,2.4196,3.8073,5.8685,0.7131,1.2039,2.2276,4.2064,0.0293,3.5402,2.0628,0.0093,6.3516,3.1774,3.2405,0.4961,0.7668,4.7297,9.1568,4.0754,0.0171,5.8652,0.0655,2.5221,0.7871,3.3594,1.2942,2.3697,2.1986,4.6452,1.7337,5.405,0.8488,2.1282,4.2893,1.7056,6.0142,1.4654,3.4649,1.7104,4.0842,0.0314,5.8851,2.8435,6.8949,2.4244,0.6843,1.2707,2.6978,6.2459,0.0038,2.7523,3.6636,6.5444,4.497,0.1487,0.6463,2.0838,6.3173,0.4837,3.0417,0.4955,0.6362,4.9834,4.2999,4.6551,3.0278,3.6802,6.0424,6.1376,2.1219,5.1732,6.0389,5.1631,1.9726,0.826,2.3076,4.6979,4.6673,6.5064,0.8248,3.4622,0.153,3.1846,5.4588,1.5111,2.9988,4.135,3.79,4.9466,0.2363,4.6473,1.098,2.1484,5.2386,0.2678,3.3603,2.3202,3.2724,2.72,3.2626,5.4964,2.8304,7.7783,0.0398,1.2585,6.2374,3.6687,0.6744]}
{"prompt":"While on a transatlantic flight , you glance at the laptop screen of the stranger sitting next to you and find that they are writing about you .","text":"While on a transatlantic flight, you glance at the laptop screen of the stranger sitting next to you and find that they are writing about you. Now imagine that when they come to the same island during your holidays, they would not write about you because you have visited it several times and hence the name of the destination for yourself. There would be no point of showing the world that they know you. The one who made it, wrote his thoughts about the unknown. But, if he shows it when he has visited it, then, surely there would be appreciation by the one who did not make it. It may be his own wish but I still see it as self-indulgence. It is as if you are trying to make somebody happy but you are really making yourself happy.\nI am thankful that we still have people like him, trying to spread the name of the destination and hence the place. It is like the little seed that will grow and make a big tree. This is the essence of travelling. You have met people and learnt a lot. Maybe there is a lot to read but there is always enough time for you.\nThese were the thoughts I had today while reading about a group of Japanese travelers visiting India. I hope we never forget how wonderful and what a great experience you get by being out of your comfort zone and by sharing a home with strangers and by learning about their cultures. Let us look for others who still make it a point of visiting places and share the same experience with them and hopefully find out the name of the place that you have not been to so far. Let us hope that there is an increase in the number of people who feel the need to do something.","token_len":344,"entropy":[4.885,2.4933,10.1452,1.7562,0.6874,1.0419,3.3077,10.6629,1.0708,1.0708,7.6149,1.9683,3.891,1.2804,8.864,4.6611,1.0318,0.0073,0.0857,1.3722,4.783,1.5307,3.0921,1.1844,6.8987,3.6254,2.3584,0.9072,5.7828,2.9703,1.8927,5.2746,2.0137,4.5861,1.3072,2.8012,3.6108,6.3517,8.7957,2.1704,6.6086,0.4983,1.1479,3.8237,3.3143,3.2066,0.3057,0.1955,3.1846,1.2442,2.7605,7.3848,3.8465,3.5236,0.0232,2.6275,9.4982,3.4508,4.9719,1.0695,0.817,4.5634,5.3948,7.7478,0.4508,5.2848,1.566,0.4068,0.5809,4.626,2.7813,6.3948,2.8363,5.038,1.5661,2.1306,4.3996,1.1188,1.9607,3.286,5.7061,1.3108,6.2029,2.7127,4.5782,7.1596,5.3866,4.384,1.6669,3.6444,7.1076,2.166,3.931,3.3565,2.8041,2.6788,7.0622,2.7436,7.1549,0.8734,3.2186,2.2618,2.3203,1.2683,2.5174,3.7337,5.5941,4.2394,1.757,0.2239,9.7619,4.7238,1.1799,5.3465,0.1736,3.9275,0.8723,4.3699,0.2325,0.6534,3.366,4.7318,0.734,5.9802,3.1019,5.1711,5.064,3.7935,5.3815,3.9597,2.3551,0.9528,7.0624,0.2766,2.9468,0.0062,1.4377,0.535,2.8927,0.7401,3.9231,0.2866,2.7753,1.5725,3.6349,0.0477,2.9683,6.0707,2.8264,2.8265,1.5212,1.5724,4.8945,3.7779,3.0992,2.0126,0.6428,1.6189,5.9393,2.1467,6.6952,1.182,3.9993,5.569,1.2116,4.3882,1.7207,4.2966,2.3098,7.6851,0.1462,5.9532,1.4069,5.838,0.1611,1.5207,3.3741,2.4974,7.8255,1.2089,5.5465,1.7848,2.8272,0.5621,3.6869,2.6029,5.8304,7.9713,1.3801,4.3918,0.6841,2.7057,4.6549,1.9141,3.0749,3.1088,1.6683,4.3643,0.7693,1.6843,5.2559,0.0726,8.0895,1.0255,3.3044,2.4386,7.8292,1.804,2.1779,5.9094,2.8978,0.393,1.4897,5.3826,3.7447,0.7474,1.3976,4.2037,2.5533,6.2553,2.6964,3.1272,0.3083,4.5902,5.1596,3.2029,1.5321,1.3697,2.8054,1.6406,5.9507,4.7257,1.1051,3.0676,1.6402,0.6715,7.1547,3.7369,4.3809,3.0214,3.8095,4.5919,0.1998,5.3516,4.1824,3.5861,4.7839,0.8323,1.9503,4.4892,4.5658,4.6336,1.3432,3.7532,3.6611,2.7279,5.8271,1.4792,2.2473,2.4819,4.8172,5.5018,4.5288,3.3122,5.3079,1.9272,1.7946,0.9098,0.0653,2.3038,5.4104,3.8465,3.0287,4.6736,0.7796,3.3157,3.5476,2.7384,4.2458,1.4462,4.3244,3.0542,0.6846,5.0381,1.1807,4.2311,5.2165,4.2983,1.2747,6.3626,4.5149,1.228,4.4575,1.8893,3.1165,1.8945,3.5657,2.8473,5.4849,2.7635,2.3758,2.9866,1.4916,2.0231,3.1676,5.0795,3.4233,3.2525,3.4881,5.1486,0.2004,0.5462,0.7878,1.9266,1.3207,2.4227,5.3628,3.0941,1.5292,5.7608,2.4644,0.2605,4.0975,0.347,2.7811,1.0562,4.1072,1.0959,3.4999,5.8616,0.2671,1.4515,0.5306,0.0493,0.8323,0.6379,5.001,1.5489,1.8458,0.1125,3.9922,4.131,2.9185]}

{"prompt":"A Shortage of Avocados Sparks a Crime Spree","text":"A Shortage of Avocados Sparks a Crime Spree\nThousands of cases in the US, Australia and New Zealand - and there may be a few more - are the result of avocados turning bad from a shortage.\nBut it turns out the real culprit here doesn't actually have to do with a lack of humidity in the grocery store, but rather with a bacterial infection that's called Botrytis.\nThat's right - fruit from the Chilean avocado crop has been linked to a fungal infection of the skin which turns it yellow and causes water to ooze out from its flesh. In many cases, this leads to the fruit becoming mouldy.\nThe avocado tree lives in hot, dry conditions, which favour the mushroom-like fungus that thrives on rotting fruit.\nThis doesn't always affect avocados. If the weather is hot and humid, for example, a fungus called Penicillium soli might cause decay on leaves. The only way to figure out whether it's the avocado that's rotting or Penicillium is to do a quick taste test.\nHere's what to look for: You can feel a dry slimy texture when you bite through the skin. Also if the skin is flaky and the fruit doesn't feel smooth, you likely have a fungus.\nFor further information about what happened in California, visit www.cbc.ca. and click on 'US' to read the latest news analysis from the Toronto Star's North American correspondent, Richard McGregor.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 16, 2016, with the headline 'Knit a sweater in a moment!'.

However, when you contact the bank and ask what the bank did now? They only contact you, wait for you to cancel and then contact you to ask whether you want the money. But, after you cancel, it will be even trickier for you to get the money back. If I know the seller, I will definitely cancel the order, and I will not be compensated by them.\nI sent her an email and asked the money back and she refused! I'm sure she is the reason why the item can't be delivered. The order is fake too!\nI contacted her and she refused to send me the money even I sent a screenshot of the payment transaction. As far as I know the order has been suspended. This is the reason why I can't order the items. She should refund the money, she is totally dishonest.\nThe seller didn't care about my money for this order. He just sent this package. And he has made 2 other orders. The seller didn't offer to refund the money!","token_len":345,"entropy":[4.1301,3.573,4.6773,13.2835,9.2395,2.6342,6.7912,3.5757,0.4524,1.9946,9.4806,1.6217,11.2997,4.2627,4.1009,5.2556,1.1477,1.2617,2.2976,2.0384,0.0794,8.923,3.0441,3.0475,1.0096,5.1853,1.6583,6.3285,2.1243,1.8159,2.8861,5.7063,0.8673,3.9415,6.0753,4.0637,3.7881,3.7257,0.617,3.8333,0.0029,4.0111,2.5862,4.8202,2.6374,3.2916,7.2878,2.2188,5.8098,5.5675,4.156,9.6331,2.262,4.4471,0.8874,3.6858,0.2562,1.8293,3.7031,6.7464,2.0322,1.962,3.0835,3.6326,2.381,2.649,0.3275,3.5455,6.4516,3.7152,6.5623,5.3145,0.1128,0.0834,0.586,2.1306,7.424,3.0163,3.8902,6.7242,2.251,4.5364,2.1955,3.4874,2.2279,2.1957,5.3759,1.2498,2.9508,2.859,4.528,2.2383,3.1075,6.2041,0.9937,3.1317,2.357,3.0373,0.1364,1.2627,4.2514,5.309,8.7509,0.9236,1.1652,2.8867,2.6553,5.657,1.0564,5.0751,1.1545,2.8274,2.6831,5.0503,4.5947,4.5284,3.92,0.411,1.05,0.9281,3.8337,0.6344,2.2113,2.5195,4.5367,0.0003,2.8137,3.7988,0.3884,1.6222,1.5592,2.9586,0.7213,2.2937,6.6254,0.9115,5.3194,0.3106,2.6284,1.4125,3.239,0.9712,0.2746,1.6416,1.8377,3.8234,1.9885,2.2174,3.26,8.026,7.4803,1.1181,5.3303,7.0472,0.6378,3.4344,6.2247,0.8585,1.3304,0.1973,4.3443,2.1749,0.9993,4.6037,0.8847,2.4143,2.9037,4.7401,1.8554,2.3077,2.5049,0.9456,3.6859,5.139,2.5523,4.3229,1.4864,2.4115,1.4631,3.4915,2.3961,1.3899,7.143,6.2059,0.0023,1.7893,1.9641,0.5565,2.3904,1.3736,0.2601,0.372,0.7403,2.8223,4.5342,4.903,2.0807,1.3249,2.2783,0.7802,2.0395,5.416,4.3972,0.7388,0.3561,1.8559,2.1883,2.1946,0.6504,2.6047,2.0443,5.5349,2.8076,1.8076,0.8581,1.455,2.8531,6.2844,6.2689,2.6876,0.3959,2.454,2.3585,4.6776,6.2036,1.1852,2.348,0.9316,4.3791,6.2029,1.9001,4.1761,2.4713,1.1215,2.754,4.2844,4.6283,1.0847,2.3219,6.3697,5.4807,0.6132,0.1848,2.7938,1.5601,3.0265,6.6227,2.0383,7.3,6.8962,2.2873,1.6986,1.9543,3.2179,2.565,1.1912,1.4495,2.7737,0.7461,2.4892,0.6433,0.9074,0.5883,5.7586,7.6176,3.1796,3.3904,4.2933,0.7024,0.5361,3.2676,6.8947,1.2476,5.4651,2.4623,0.0075,0.4763,0.619,2.3407,4.3648,2.2382,0.8861,6.1095,1.6164,4.2117,0.872,2.0877,2.4628,0.3362,1.4224,2.9021,0.3069,3.9059,1.7569,2.5912,2.1417,4.4617,4.4949,3.9121,1.0579,0.3646,2.8484,3.0037,2.2621,5.385,4.3374,1.0179,0.9057,2.7354,0.8642,4.8494,0.0009,4.9113,0.7875,1.9745,1.6733,4.8791,3.8606,3.4722,0.843,3.135,1.9844,3.3679,5.1679,7.2192,2.7919,4.3636,2.0877,3.2593,4.0713,7.0887,3.5978,3.2429,1.776,2.4361,3.6903,3.4128,0.0005,6.7841,1.4868,1.2068,1.1309,0.158,5.433]}

The Headmaster at Hogwarts is holding a meeting to discuss the new problem that the wizarding world is facing : Muggleborns are declining their invitations to Hogwarts because technology is now far superior to magic. This new invention is called the Horcrux, a special technology that keeps their memories alive, which is very useful when they get into a brawl. In order to make sure that Muggleborns really want to enter the Academy of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hogwarts decided to make the rules fair and give a scholarship to the student that has the best grade ever. The school's goal is that no Muggle-born ever gets the scholarship. The students who want the scholarship were put on probation and must complete the final year at Hogwarts in order to be eligible for one. When you have a scholarship, you also have to make sure that your parents' wills were written properly, as only the most talented students have it. This year, it turns out to be a tough year, and the school is going to have a lot of competition. I really wanted to finish this book, but some of the words just didn't make sense. A lot of people love this book because it's a story about Harry Potter, but many people find out that it's really about the education system and the new technology, not about Harry Potter. I will say that it's a very interesting book. It's like a little storybook, but it can be a whole book if you read it in one day. It's not very interesting story, but you can also find out a lot about education, magic, and the future. But I don't think that it's a very good book.","token_len":346,"entropy":[6.8972,2.5904,5.8309,5.5292,1.7238,2.2339,10.7118,2.1585,5.6588,3.7517,1.7979,6.419,0.7357,2.7242,1.8768,0.5674,0.7762,3.8493,7.8683,3.0752,2.4647,4.7814,0.0055,0.171,1.4183,0.3652,8.786,6.336,0.3994,2.1088,0.6222,3.1695,7.8511,3.0232,8.5377,0.2333,1.3679,3.0031,12.0022,1.303,5.2105,4.432,2.8913,0.1771,4.3176,0.802,3.4735,4.1341,6.8767,1.7435,2.7618,1.3133,6.6954,0.0249,0.2176,1.5112,2.2425,4.7806,4.0304,0.6993,6.3616,5.3432,6.3947,1.7187,2.1708,3.2493,1.6049,4.1843,1.5279,3.3984,2.0492,5.1686,2.534,3.0834,6.2352,1.0634,3.6317,2.0536,0.0798,2.8803,3.3241,0.883,3.7882,1.3131,0.0342,0.0437,7.2197,2.931,0.1739,3.126,1.4358,4.6426,3.3392,2.4198,0.0008,0.0106,0.0002,0.002,0.2642,3.4197,5.3754,0.2344,2.5592,2.0082,6.8742,8.607,1.6256,4.7897,4.2702,5.8577,0.3253,2.0617,5.0131,3.5334,3.1908,1.193,2.1025,7.1298,7.3143,1.0023,1.7058,3.3981,2.9368,5.907,0.4202,3.4954,4.1842,1.8468,0.0289,5.739,0.003,3.8878,1.6267,3.0111,1.506,1.2123,1.7999,3.066,1.9703,4.4234,2.5031,0.2552,5.9227,5.7881,1.1325,2.8303,2.0136,4.3696,2.7678,2.5791,5.6806,2.8513,3.441,0.2288,3.1047,0.199,0.0915,2.1989,0.9221,0.6618,6.1791,0.7725,4.4422,4.0948,3.691,1.9227,2.6665,0.4834,0.5679,5.1382,1.6054,0.8487,4.1484,0.9927,0.4332,2.0232,2.2966,4.7032,7.286,4.2441,3.2761,3.0304,2.0586,3.1974,6.7754,1.6706,4.3143,3.7011,1.2235,2.6384,5.0305,0.2573,2.7728,4.0703,0.6922,3.7968,4.8406,0.003,4.8633,0.0589,1.3083,4.8037,2.5105,2.5491,2.6755,1.542,2.5366,1.4559,2.8976,0.3739,1.1145,2.5441,1.9032,0.2094,4.8691,1.1134,4.5674,5.1456,3.2486,0.0908,5.8608,1.9866,2.0249,1.2593,0.8269,6.205,1.3081,0.5346,5.8435,4.3149,1.9709,0.0019,2.2067,0.8399,0.7292,4.7875,1.3707,0.0333,1.8248,5.4302,1.4983,0.2237,2.9943,0.6084,1.5886,2.145,3.0523,0.9053,4.9296,0.5967,1.3254,1.3087,4.74,0.7589,4.7499,5.1358,0.7903,1.8891,0.5713,3.3166,1.5366,2.2854,6.9651,2.1598,1.7283,1.5616,5.7778,2.2671,2.7846,2.9868,1.0869,3.6182,0.8622,0.5038,2.0318,4.8945,2.8391,0.8689,2.739,0.7217,1.6758,1.9553,2.0942,0.5706,1.4379,1.5765,0.6855,5.0876,0.9261,4.1571,3.2697,3.296,1.394,0.9715,1.6153,5.6802,0.9621,1.9947,5.4763,2.6341,3.4246,0.1345,4.2222,0.5343,2.205,2.5687,4.268,0.2735,1.7194,0.4501,2.1981,3.7338,3.6861,6.4926,1.0815,0.4647,3.7724,1.1023,5.1351,3.0786,1.3103,2.6281,0.099,0.527,6.3893,2.2966,3.9705,0.3096,0.7945,1.6417,2.934,1.817,4.9924,1.7942,3.4803,0.0007,0.9238,1.5801,2.0892,0.5863,2.0188,2.8194,0.9449,0.3294,0.8126]}
{"prompt":"Season 30 of Game of Thrones","text":"Season 30 of Game of Thrones\u2019 first episode (SPOILERS FOLLOW), \u201cThe Hounds of Baskervilles,\u201d wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect from Game of Thrones. Instead of dragging out an epic saga, \u201cThe Hounds of Baskervilles\u201d features five episodes of less-than-stellar drama. Let\u2019s take a look at why we\u2019re not a fan of this episode.\nLike most of Game of Thrones, \u201cThe Hounds of Baskervilles\u201d is a bit surreal. This is not the first time that the show has used surreal imagery, so what\u2019s new? The plot isn\u2019t about fantasy or science. It\u2019s more of a mystery, one that could be explored better. The Hounds of Baskervilles features an interesting character that will not be developed.\nAs with all of these episodes, \u201cThe Hounds of Baskervilles\u201d starts slowly. After introducing the characters, viewers are asked to wait and then they are introduced to the characters in the flashback. If the episodes had been 20 minutes shorter, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. We get a sense of everyone\u2019s emotions in The Hounds of Baskervilles as the events unfold. The Hounds of Baskervilles\u2018 plot was weak.\nIt\u2019s hard to understand why a story could have three characters who are at odds with each other. It\u2019s like everyone knows what you know. The story feels rushed and boring. The plot has two distinct problems, neither of which Game of Thrones has ever encountered before.","token_len":346,"entropy":[7.6302,2.3977,6.6461,3.7901,0.754,12.9022,9.7494,9.1112,2.8257,4.0821,7.9206,0.002,0.6907,8.9123,0.0321,3.7044,8.683,5.6272,5.1334,6.812,0.6387,0.8854,4.0928,5.2251,1.7037,0.0285,2.6279,1.2775,6.8296,10.5577,4.2111,5.363,2.8619,6.0012,2.4022,5.2098,1.6517,5.8408,1.902,2.2441,3.1852,0.0203,0.0059,0.7566,3.7642,2.0332,8.0808,2.7967,3.2214,2.2291,4.191,1.8271,7.2213,0.2109,1.4314,0.6994,0.0009,0.196,0.0022,0.0009,0.0042,0.0066,2.1793,3.2068,6.3761,5.3844,2.7471,1.503,8.1828,2.1471,0.0911,0.0494,1.135,3.467,1.9816,5.2963,4.3722,1.1691,0.662,2.0877,0.0854,0.3029,0.2514,3.5768,3.1201,4.3893,0.1541,1.4989,2.7669,5.6397,0.4741,0.2812,2.0101,4.2735,0.8614,0.3652,12.6295,2.2424,1.4637,2.0079,0.0259,0.0012,0.9163,1.5872,0.0761,0.1331,0.0618,0.0008,0.0632,0.0021,0.0017,0.0026,0.0145,1.1663,0.1493,0.958,1.5357,4.254,7.3377,0.9941,4.3092,1.1622,2.8882,2.0137,0.9287,0.4885,1.4692,1.7422,0.7219,0.237,3.9954,7.7084,2.1218,2.6314,4.397,3.7849,3.1816,0.1854,1.9418,5.301,2.1407,2.7252,4.992,4.2373,0.767,0.0772,0.2885,3.9015,7.8842,2.1915,3.2273,3.5086,1.7696,2.016,0.0085,0.6854,3.6759,2.7533,0.4804,4.311,2.025,4.4493,0.4543,4.2126,1.404,3.3532,6.3121,1.7914,2.2296,3.4121,0.0081,0.1901,0.0087,0.0025,0.0049,0.0342,3.9346,3.246,3.5156,2.7769,3.1912,4.7249,3.7436,1.4332,8.2571,3.9052,2.2718,3.9538,3.1625,2.3544,1.6015,3.1855,1.5126,0.1471,1.8398,0.0894,0.1586,0.0171,0.0016,0.0221,0.0022,0.0025,0.0038,0.035,0.2138,0.3866,4.8381,5.2242,1.3741,4.4031,6.4719,1.6237,3.9935,1.0096,6.5383,1.8533,5.1378,0.3994,4.6376,3.5526,4.5227,4.4033,1.1628,1.0758,0.286,1.2177,2.8441,2.8003,1.5701,6.3578,1.4057,4.5454,2.0007,5.4581,5.9734,0.9336,8.1345,0.6234,5.8016,0.2391,2.1263,3.4559,0.2308,0.0756,0.0579,0.4492,3.6845,1.1235,4.0713,3.4749,1.669,3.9978,0.4624,9.3491,1.4256,0.0163,0.3179,4.3595,3.0682,5.6083,0.4339,0.0023,0.0487,0.0035,0.0022,0.0052,0.0592,4.004,2.3499,3.2478,0.6189,0.3223,2.2644,3.3417,0.0045,0.0902,0.0038,0.0023,0.0039,0.0204,4.8522,6.6254,7.5111,4.1916,8.3687,2.2919,2.6242,3.6634,2.3634,0.0221,0.0215,2.8869,0.1637,3.7618,0.9511,3.1509,3.4473,4.0713,2.3305,5.5996,2.6387,2.8939,1.0553,5.2313,1.0801,0.7352,0.5294,0.0206,0.7721,2.5589,0.9986,0.0109,0.0148,3.988,7.6188,3.9901,2.5887,4.5096,3.6944,1.6478,2.3549,3.1712,5.2357,3.2874,1.0557,5.2881,0.6321,1.6904,3.3184,3.737,4.7634,4.6252,4.9824,2.8654,7.1258,0.2002,0.0844,10.4865,0.0136,0.0008,1.9585,2.7623,4.248,1.6544,0.1662]}

However, when the time to re-awaken comes, a software glitch occurs. At first they do not have enough energy to escape, so they begin to murder their fellow prisoners, leaving nothing but a horrific bloodshed. However, their thirsty neighbors discover their subterranean nightmare... and one by one, they lose consciousness, leaving them vulnerable to zombies who are all too happy to eat their fleshy bodies.\nOne of the things that differentiates the original Dawn from recent zombie movies is that the zombification part happens outside the bunkers, through the actions of a mysterious entity called the \u201c Unscorched Man \u201d. These zombies have a distinct ability that makes them unstoppable \u2013 they can survive exposure to the sun, which is why they have been called the \u201c Sunzombie \u201d in later films.\nAs for our survivors, they are only able to escape to the ground-level facility through the help of the mysterious, but also somewhat dangerous, Cylons ( the new, unbelievably evil and brain-controlled form of humans ) that they encounter during their escape attempt. As you might imagine from the title, Dawn also has some other things in common with the original film. For example, it was directed by Zack Snyder, who directed the last two Spider-Man films, and co-wrote the script with Gary Whitta and Tony Gilroy ( both of whom were also involved with the movie\u2019s original script ). The film itself also stars Michael Shannon ( The Machinist, The Town ), and Johnathon Schaech ( The Machinist, I Love You, Man ).","token_len":346,"entropy":[8.9177,3.5956,5.6263,4.0854,2.5682,5.483,0.5968,0.3375,6.8949,5.8315,2.3289,1.7789,6.4118,0.7053,7.2313,0.9047,3.7419,0.0791,5.8401,1.3997,5.3321,0.0286,3.4641,1.2791,5.8056,6.1074,5.0897,0.6272,6.358,0.1892,2.7287,0.1584,2.9002,10.7194,2.1948,5.6483,1.9498,5.3598,1.8969,4.0359,4.3709,0.1983,3.7047,2.7942,1.8716,0.2532,3.4685,0.9083,3.302,0.5283,4.3453,0.948,10.0499,2.1881,2.8419,2.8196,2.0681,4.3656,6.4666,0.7062,2.9059,7.0079,11.6026,0.5548,3.2789,0.0489,4.5294,14.43,5.4362,4.4182,3.1461,6.3799,0.0525,6.7916,6.1184,1.5529,5.3545,3.827,0.0038,0.9182,0.7275,5.0372,3.4334,2.3758,3.3205,2.4515,5.162,0.1249,8.4752,4.2391,2.3593,4.8162,0.9714,2.0854,0.0359,2.5252,1.284,2.5027,8.2685,2.6124,0.3539,1.811,9.4723,1.4143,0.317,5.6649,0.6294,7.2336,0.0013,1.5229,3.8567,6.5222,1.8418,7.8273,6.0316,2.3534,0.3387,1.1981,1.4305,8.7688,0.0559,1.6508,6.789,6.4876,5.8531,1.2959,9.3513,0.0781,0.989,6.8817,1.4334,6.8853,0.039,2.3342,5.4645,3.7338,1.0415,1.3381,12.2962,6.0345,11.2842,6.0641,3.4363,0.2671,4.6064,3.9195,6.226,1.896,4.2275,1.9806,2.6034,2.3253,5.5615,4.4591,3.4218,1.7571,0.2391,5.4411,6.064,0.9399,1.1117,6.1155,7.1549,0.1383,2.3674,2.581,0.9405,4.1405,1.5478,2.6363,0.7402,2.7068,2.6708,2.9756,1.2366,3.2623,0.6414,6.4113,7.6464,2.7793,1.3401,0.2597,3.4262,8.1674,1.2684,0.2286,1.7003,4.0279,3.0483,5.8695,5.6201,0.2047,1.294,0.9232,4.9742,3.2518,0.0056,3.615,4.4017,1.6973,4.98,6.474,0.8902,5.536,4.1286,1.7115,4.8674,0.0199,1.8093,6.1569,4.1476,3.3385,4.4406,5.6189,3.6939,0.972,7.0228,4.3966,0.4391,5.064,9.6361,6.3464,4.3804,10.2829,4.2659,4.5207,7.535,0.9832,6.3984,5.6451,0.107,4.2961,2.232,1.9718,3.1407,4.4176,2.9052,0.7763,2.4419,3.5615,0.22,3.5091,3.4308,2.2888,1.5404,4.1571,0.4865,1.4771,0.4906,3.7491,5.8518,1.2987,2.7219,4.8847,3.5325,1.6791,0.3384,0.207,1.2201,1.6974,2.8756,1.4338,4.3217,2.0531,0.0354,1.8078,3.2024,4.8212,0.0818,4.4938,0.0235,1.0485,1.2592,3.3444,0.6546,5.7129,1.5545,7.1532,0.0668,0.0506,0.6409,1.135,1.1075,5.8695,0.0098,0.512,0.739,1.9918,0.4127,5.8825,4.4373,0.0006,1.9678,5.7499,2.5884,0.0043,3.1585,4.3473,0.9185,0.1892,2.4102,2.0377,2.3858,1.0901,0.6563,4.7502,10.6505,6.9261,7.1503,2.5904,2.2356,3.6956,1.9902,2.4775,3.8886,2.7362,2.6894,3.5673,3.3846,1.7065,2.3972,9.5369,0.2356,0.1308,3.8597,1.7215,7.6104,2.726,3.1487,4.4423,8.155,7.2179,4.623,0.5808,1.5275,6.4541,0.0203,0.0038,1.2944,5.8393,3.5761,0.7888,1.1089,5.9743,1.7611]}

The villain could be in a real world and the story is told with details that the public would know like he is married to a young woman, son, is a bank clerk, worked for a criminal organization,etc. In a live action film, the villain would be a professional film actor or a retired actor who might play a different character in other films. The villain may be a real life person or a character that the director and writers made up. He has a unique name, which implies other characters using that name would be evil. It may imply that the villain s intentions are evil but in the end his intentions or what he says actually are good. The villain s name is related to the type of villain he is. For example, a killer villain always carries a weapon. A murderer usually carries a murder weapon and even in some cases the murder weapon is used as a weapon. A thief uses items that he has stolen, a trickster uses items that are easy to find. Some villiances are more likely to be named after real people that the public has seen in media like the movie Pirates of the Caribbean. Often the only clue that the audience knows something bad happened is that the villain or someone with a negative history gets killed, and the name hints at what happened. The film also needs to be consistent with the name of the villain at every point.","token_len":346,"entropy":[10.6665,1.7988,2.4302,13.132,0.3854,2.0321,3.8129,5.4111,1.0075,2.7922,9.2601,5.6703,10.9188,2.7225,3.4416,0.6232,0.8772,5.2076,1.3941,6.281,6.1348,0.8923,2.8042,2.0923,3.4345,1.324,1.0676,1.9273,4.051,4.3213,5.7695,8.8916,3.1953,2.0447,3.4663,6.1271,3.3817,1.4398,4.9934,6.608,1.4402,5.4914,0.3282,3.9166,1.7291,4.1814,2.9502,1.3915,3.8552,1.2534,6.4067,7.9412,2.8633,0.896,3.8744,2.0965,5.6889,0.2423,5.7004,0.7992,9.5577,5.2684,5.1905,2.8991,5.641,1.7186,5.781,1.5295,8.1286,0.225,1.5131,2.0391,2.174,5.6322,1.0428,4.5487,1.1643,5.7026,2.2563,3.4624,2.8463,2.7107,1.4098,2.8909,3.4661,7.2239,2.3257,2.3917,6.5727,2.4781,3.3916,7.7475,4.6538,1.8652,8.0104,1.0089,1.4859,5.5876,1.2357,1.981,7.7222,0.938,7.022,1.612,7.2515,5.1947,0.3919,7.2312,1.7521,0.7891,7.269,0.7211,0.5305,8.6878,0.1109,3.4131,2.8399,6.4207,0.5462,1.927,0.59,0.9092,1.0015,2.6424,1.6683,2.3423,6.2983,6.4553,1.8174,2.6308,1.9217,6.8987,2.7995,2.405,5.3668,2.7106,0.9732,4.2694,0.9915,2.1034,4.7109,1.3249,0.3424,1.8775,1.7485,3.3764,1.4717,1.4318,3.7878,1.706,2.2153,2.0744,1.0229,2.5347,2.813,2.9948,6.0821,4.2313,3.9033,5.8263,1.2839,1.0682,3.8051,2.877,1.1382,4.5785,6.0075,1.5264,3.0414,5.839,7.3169,2.2056,7.6083,2.4225,0.3435,3.1333,1.0644,7.2686,0.9043,3.72,3.0293,6.3515,0.8493,0.8294,0.4317,8.7146,8.202,0.8524,3.6705,3.1731,4.2082,2.018,0.8963,3.9935,2.029,6.3329,5.0961,0.7558,3.8589,5.5659,2.9131,0.5433,0.3909,1.8427,1.0854,2.1271,3.332,1.5008,5.9884,0.0788,0.9159,6.4608,0.0384,1.5535,3.3471,0.5248,1.112,3.6968,0.217,0.2882,2.3899,5.9164,4.0826,7.608,3.9187,0.531,3.7989,2.119,2.2496,3.0227,2.3284,0.7024,0.3469,7.2469,0.0773,2.655,5.4958,3.6283,3.1595,1.1602,2.3667,4.0445,0.1643,0.7592,2.8517,2.4378,0.3065,0.6428,1.0293,2.4114,5.1907,5.2825,6.8482,1.8731,1.5453,2.345,0.7527,2.6996,3.5502,7.2492,0.0797,0.1453,0.75,0.491,3.445,6.879,0.221,2.0562,3.1742,4.0522,9.8322,16.57,2.3631,3.0609,4.2524,0.1041,1.9262,5.3242,1.6669,4.319,0.8385,4.3506,2.4599,3.9817,3.4826,1.3552,2.0016,6.6761,4.4115,3.0867,2.6514,5.0757,0.2348,0.0316,0.0008,0.7285,6.304,1.2727,5.7344,6.6628,1.5602,0.8605,7.3668,2.4319,4.5232,4.8352,3.3454,0.6496,1.7068,0.7358,1.1437,4.9766,5.3475,3.0229,1.7017,6.1556,6.2469,4.746,2.708,2.8392,2.7836,1.5981,6.1433,8.5485,0.5081,3.8727,2.2511,0.843,1.8955,6.7707,3.4823,6.5488,0.4577,2.1823,6.3042,0.8317,0.6286,5.3025,0.9388,0.1856,0.4443,5.8129,3.67,2.1088,1.0049]}

However, you're an educated woman you are sick of this crap. So are we, and that is why I am writing this article on the subject :\nMy intention is to tell you about the very real dangers surrounding this subject and that some people think is funny.\nLet me warn you about two issues. You may think you are being funny, but we are not getting off easy.\nD. The other way is a very dangerous situation : men who like to be cheeky. Remember the'''men who like to play'''' games? That'''guys'''' like to play games and get you. They like to play with your emotions. When you've been caught in the fun of it as you say, you are in a very vulnerable state.\nThe trick is to know how these guys work. They will come to you slowly until they get a better sense of you and your mindset.\nSo how does a guy get you to take him up on a game? He will ask you out to parties with friends. He will ask you away from friends so he can watch you. The way he works is by having an open mind and letting himself go. You will find out by the time the date has finished.\nMen who get me to do things this way have done it before. They will try a range of methods to make me do things. They will use humour, they will flirt with me, they will try to make me feel attracted to them.\nThey will put you in a vulnerable spot and then once you have fallen for their charm they will push this vulnerable spot and have a go.","token_len":348,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,8.2658,3.8306,1.7436,5.9997,7.8117,0.0113,2.7475,1.1893,2.9449,6.0118,2.3869,1.7164,1.0416,8.7047,0.4677,1.3699,6.0638,0.1062,1.3066,1.2194,4.7884,6.4232,3.126,6.3581,3.5759,8.5504,0.4829,5.6672,4.7826,0.9284,3.3387,6.2642,4.1852,2.4107,1.6095,3.592,2.9693,0.8814,2.1812,2.2329,2.4663,0.5659,2.3465,4.4949,2.2915,2.5252,10.3984,2.6777,6.5604,7.6261,0.8047,0.367,3.3631,0.283,1.8948,1.5473,5.1239,1.2936,3.2787,6.6831,3.4151,4.4008,2.3194,4.6484,6.0028,2.0361,4.2668,2.9661,5.5397,0.8543,1.6142,4.1155,0.9744,6.2632,0.0445,3.0898,5.2577,4.1443,1.8331,5.1382,2.054,2.9021,2.2352,1.6036,2.6587,1.7953,1.3442,0.4375,4.9223,1.3359,1.1854,7.3833,4.5246,1.6028,0.6116,1.4414,6.7599,4.9439,2.5482,7.565,5.2119,3.0461,3.9806,3.6855,3.6449,3.5039,4.493,6.8054,2.3694,4.2766,0.5588,1.9373,9.3997,0.0039,2.055,6.551,2.4289,15.8928,5.1611,8.2184,0.6533,0.2532,0.0177,6.6049,15.9575,5.3258,3.7757,3.6284,4.0732,1.4898,9.2208,0.2431,9.7606,3.3794,0.1881,2.1364,2.411,2.9869,4.1172,5.0984,5.2932,3.025,2.7316,0.1866,2.1026,2.8452,2.9907,5.4566,1.2042,4.1364,0.925,5.3649,1.5173,5.5104,2.8532,1.6451,6.2842,1.5439,1.8538,7.0526,2.6875,4.7132,0.5289,1.7517,2.4824,3.8289,1.686,2.3801,4.154,2.6789,0.5381,1.829,3.0198,6.6488,0.9296,0.5782,4.1653,2.2144,6.394,1.346,4.413,1.0317,2.3334,3.1544,4.3218,1.9129,0.2388,7.7033,6.7636,1.4019,2.1878,3.2244,5.5168,3.8526,0.1027,1.0605,1.5901,1.5791,6.5675,0.3728,2.2166,3.9269,3.5885,2.7341,2.3281,2.1663,2.5131,3.2962,0.7281,4.4638,2.1571,3.4278,0.1069,3.935,3.7731,1.1765,3.0169,1.2046,3.2239,0.4816,4.7349,3.1627,3.9426,4.4674,2.445,1.0742,1.526,0.2708,1.9968,0.1986,9.2489,1.1535,3.8001,4.1142,1.3391,0.1449,4.032,1.2877,2.1487,3.9963,3.7954,1.3164,3.9092,0.608,2.105,3.9424,3.542,2.396,0.8433,1.4144,3.7403,4.6166,1.9614,1.0339,2.8997,1.6572,3.2055,1.9816,4.4952,1.9025,0.7053,3.0456,3.9441,4.5267,4.2693,0.8806,1.162,5.5211,1.4312,3.9252,6.0283,0.9322,2.092,2.9489,5.4315,0.0227,3.5016,4.684,1.1568,2.2068,0.6001,1.7334,2.8416,3.8305,5.2244,6.8012,0.0393,3.6729,1.3467,2.6628,1.5322,2.4569,1.0826,3.1849,1.6528,0.7356,3.6308,6.8824,1.3503,4.6293,0.0833,4.8114,1.2711,3.1765,0.9312,0.2752,0.0495,3.089,0.5059,2.3449,0.3576,1.5623,7.1985,0.5011,0.1662,0.482,1.4684,2.5475,0.5973,4.451,1.7401,1.1522,1.0691,6.0244,3.4617,1.6074,2.3655,6.1052,0.5469,1.6602,6.0735,2.7635,2.8912,3.4401,2.2869,0.1799,4.6139,7.416,3.4747,1.4752,3.054,5.3292,3.2513,4.6025,1.8064]}

Today the descendants of those who escaped on The Ark will set foot on their homeworld for the first time. The story is based on the book of Revelation and stars Matthew Perry, David Duchovny, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Matthew Gray Gubler, John Goodman, Josh Dallas, and Kim Cattrall.\nThe story will take place in the year 2036 and follows the heroine of the series, Samantha Jones, who is attempting to find meaning in her life after a failed relationship. She has become a career woman, has gained a position at a leading advertising firm and seems happy at work, but when she\u2019s forced to turn down a promotion because she can\u2019t leave her boss\u2019s daughter alone, she realises that there are real problems in her life. Samantha Jones travels to Palm Springs, California, where she meets and falls in love with Dr. Richard Hendricks. Richard, himself, is a successful neurosurgeon in his mid-thirties, who is suffering from an ongoing and extremely painful depression.\nRichard and Samantha join The Ark, the massive and very high-tech research facility where a team of scientists are planning to establish a brand new colony on Mars. The scientists, led by Dr. Bill Warner, are convinced that humans have the capacity to survive a trip to Mars. But Bill\u2019s biggest concern is Richard, who he believes has a problem and needs more time to be studied. The scientists have brought in Dr. Michael Ames, the president of the corporation which built The Ark \u2013 and the one who created the Ark itself \u2013 and he has asked Dr. Warner to look after and study Richard.","token_len":349,"entropy":[7.4016,1.1412,6.0029,6.3843,1.7653,9.8972,1.134,3.3166,9.5309,0.0846,1.2898,4.0724,2.4985,7.8851,0.0635,3.2467,0.9177,4.9402,6.009,8.245,4.3078,3.6368,7.0637,2.3018,0.4951,5.6299,1.9705,0.2509,5.4449,1.1647,0.6544,0.0026,0.9145,2.5185,5.2152,2.122,4.0489,0.1797,1.0114,3.4739,2.4584,2.362,2.3156,6.6999,6.8979,7.159,1.2201,3.9957,5.9619,0.3545,0.009,0.0001,0.3938,7.2158,5.3425,2.2105,0.1567,0.4378,5.3392,8.7159,7.3088,5.6751,1.0744,0.3906,3.8268,5.8177,0.3906,6.8797,9.0455,0.6135,1.7783,7.1512,5.2388,1.2665,0.0142,0.3063,0.9078,9.0595,2.6662,3.0036,2.7291,0.1989,0.9144,1.0729,2.0411,2.6271,4.016,1.8624,3.4174,1.2984,9.5152,2.1719,0.839,4.5841,0.9658,6.788,6.2867,0.7172,1.0593,1.6841,5.6964,0.0574,2.7344,5.3618,0.465,0.7776,1.1207,1.7458,2.5843,4.2303,3.9391,2.4512,1.9263,2.7249,3.5447,1.6806,8.7325,2.49,2.2018,6.3327,4.3811,1.5604,6.0794,1.7108,0.9492,5.0763,7.004,1.7646,1.6783,6.6116,4.9194,3.0758,3.8658,2.3894,0.838,2.3095,0.8939,17.5741,9.3381,1.216,3.6245,0.161,4.8602,1.4068,0.9712,2.0624,3.9445,1.1664,3.8677,4.963,0.4809,0.0653,5.1827,1.1277,7.0052,3.716,0.0307,0.5624,5.0299,4.5346,0.768,0.5077,8.6011,0.0201,1.1079,3.4978,1.7615,5.9824,1.6329,2.3206,0.5036,0.188,0.92,4.1855,5.4667,5.5953,0.8691,11.5431,0.3477,0.844,0.5431,0.7573,1.1625,0.3895,1.9659,3.7553,1.8086,0.0486,0.051,0.0278,6.0308,0.0823,4.8557,6.9803,2.2831,6.2562,2.8302,6.9558,3.3867,0.9748,0.9397,4.2554,5.3495,0.2212,0.0023,3.9789,1.726,4.6817,0.2456,2.6957,0.0006,0.0001,1.2321,2.6568,1.8687,5.8899,0.0686,3.1054,5.3394,4.3537,5.3009,2.8514,4.7631,0.3134,3.4294,4.0064,2.4071,0.2713,5.3935,7.3148,0.5497,2.5041,3.2218,7.2669,2.9776,5.2173,6.0558,0.5335,0.9172,4.6176,1.3995,3.5487,4.1922,3.4189,0.1194,1.0679,1.9653,5.0326,0.8069,5.8191,0.607,7.1999,0.3843,4.3963,1.55,2.5083,0.4778,1.75,4.0732,2.8313,1.0858,0.0093,1.2136,0.0339,5.9592,8.4677,0.2697,1.2836,5.1193,0.2116,4.0447,2.2269,3.0143,2.175,0.1713,2.4129,4.0167,6.6923,0.2547,0.383,1.6428,2.7874,5.2951,8.9809,0.1605,0.0072,8.1358,3.0943,0.3909,6.6037,2.2897,0.6532,4.909,1.9033,2.096,2.6694,4.626,3.2228,3.6171,5.0325,2.0542,0.2836,5.8884,8.5345,0.7609,2.5009,3.0052,3.0235,5.4367,1.8472,2.4084,0.0288,5.1378,8.492,0.7214,2.5302,5.7665,0.09,0.5872,6.0447,3.6923,5.5122,1.8782,0.0116,6.6762,1.9081,2.9308,4.9235,0.734,4.6811,1.025,3.3939,3.4929,1.4346,2.4118,2.6603,1.6132,4.7105,2.6921,0.011,2.5577,0.3663,5.4462,3.4231,5.8905,3.1206,2.349,1.087]}

Is it good or bad to use these types of characters? As a whole I think the work is okay, but not good enough for the level you chose to place it on. The story sounds very original. I'm looking forward to reading it, but not because I think my writing is good, I'm doing it because of the author. I'm a novice writer and I always look forward to reading others work. Writing like this should be taken more serious and written up with proper grammar and editing. The story is interesting but you need to get rid of some of the cliched scenes and try to use other words more often. The best thing to do is make up your own story.\nI think it's a great idea for a project! Though sometimes I wish I had written it. I really feel that I want to show off my writing skills and it would be more fun to showcase my own stories.\nThe ideas are good and the writing is good with a few grammar errors. I also think that the plot needs work. It's all good to keep in mind for future work.\nSo, I have to admit that this was a fun and short story I read. There isn't a lot of development in this, and I don't know how you got that character in there. Your story doesn't really pull me in at all yet.

This is not uncommon. Does this matter to anyone else? The most productive work that has come from these forums over the years was in genre fiction and it's certainly not the only place it exists.\nThere's no need to be ashamed of any aspect of your work. The purpose of forums like \/r\/WritingPrompts is for people to engage together in the discussion of what's going on in the world of the writing they love. Not just to discuss what works, but to talk about why the work has come to be in the particular form of storytelling in which it's written.\nSo maybe take a trip down to \/r\/WritingPrompts now and look through the thread listings that interest you. Think about whether or not you'd like to attend any of the discussions they're having there. If so, go to your favorite thread and participate. If not, move on. You will have a very fulfilling writing experience.\nI like writing both genre and non genre. My books in these categories have varied dramatically in quality over the years, but a handful of them were among the best books I ever wrote. The genre fandom here at \/r\/WritingPrompts is very friendly and welcoming and I enjoy a lot of the discussions in the general r\/WritingPrompts thread as well.\nFor the past four years, I'd come here in two weeks and leave for another two, never leaving comments or taking any part in the discussions. I'm now actively participating and looking forward to coming back after the weekend.","token_len":350,"entropy":[2.5476,6.2475,2.3626,0.249,10.5632,2.7975,0.657,3.6917,9.3791,1.8864,0.8662,5.787,1.0227,0.3691,5.9272,0.3235,0.0206,9.6051,6.9375,1.7551,0.9904,0.901,4.0637,11.4914,2.1212,3.3846,12.6811,3.8819,0.0598,0.0013,3.6437,0.8604,0.0035,4.554,2.1006,1.9573,3.4308,1.4049,2.4585,5.6477,1.992,7.989,1.0386,5.7413,1.4209,5.0567,4.0697,1.2342,3.7246,4.2945,7.488,6.3279,3.212,2.9922,3.6079,2.1281,3.8749,5.0216,4.1039,0.0576,2.2162,3.5733,4.1026,7.4706,0.3531,3.2142,3.0968,1.6313,5.3373,0.9579,2.4638,1.097,4.3039,5.0486,4.0583,0.3632,1.7824,6.3663,2.2203,2.5256,2.6661,0.2174,3.0846,4.3545,0.6072,3.6917,4.8665,0.0425,1.4814,1.2679,1.1406,2.8161,5.1,0.1952,6.9655,2.3871,1.6696,0.0055,0.0016,0.8848,0.0527,0.0002,0.0082,0.2436,4.2243,2.0191,0.5294,4.423,7.1764,1.7886,3.2785,1.5068,0.8462,2.8068,2.3603,2.8182,0.0416,0.8497,1.1173,0.9249,2.2279,3.7451,2.5188,7.064,2.3971,0.4903,5.0662,2.5462,2.5191,2.753,2.5209,3.182,1.2148,0.6286,0.7342,4.2112,0.2506,4.4039,3.5427,2.4057,3.463,4.5283,0.7171,0.8674,3.8791,0.5953,7.9683,3.0591,2.863,6.0103,4.1408,1.4941,0.2828,2.2908,3.6299,0.2718,1.5014,3.8338,6.2527,8.1664,1.0687,5.8255,1.8966,4.378,0.664,0.0044,0.0024,0.7914,0.0415,0.0001,0.0105,5.3673,0.9338,4.1616,3.008,1.23,3.9462,5.1439,3.7308,7.8632,0.0396,0.5164,6.2479,0.8005,5.0838,1.4396,0.0022,1.0163,2.7774,0.8764,0.1172,5.8069,3.9752,0.687,1.1107,3.3451,5.5293,2.8369,2.3877,5.2757,0.41,2.0559,0.9853,0.0289,4.2059,2.6137,3.789,3.0814,3.5736,0.9751,5.6855,0.955,1.6895,0.2863,0.0562,5.4727,0.2316,0.9145,3.8649,4.0694,3.0918,1.4375,3.4526,6.4352,2.5061,1.57,1.4962,0.7176,3.0462,5.1165,2.6828,7.3111,4.4145,1.3323,2.369,3.0417,2.4313,4.3571,5.9756,5.6223,5.0986,2.0729,2.3086,6.0381,6.6216,1.8633,1.533,2.2398,0.2358,0.1726,1.3881,0.9221,5.1201,5.2145,0.3021,1.5453,3.1733,5.6016,0.5627,0.6836,3.812,0.6858,1.7978,2.1611,0.3803,3.2546,4.1977,7.334,5.2052,1.9603,1.673,0.0082,0.0017,0.7217,0.019,0.0001,0.0046,0.7464,3.4145,5.9467,0.701,2.1928,2.3561,1.4855,4.0797,4.2379,1.2848,0.1191,1.2146,3.7542,4.3803,1.4179,4.4356,6.891,0.0372,1.618,0.1132,0.0001,0.0494,4.3147,3.2927,0.1186,0.353,1.0389,4.2453,2.4937,2.8134,4.629,0.2377,0.593,0.647,5.298,5.857,2.7377,3.9438,5.7855,5.7819,1.8832,7.1836,3.4308,3.9921,2.7271,3.3691,6.6769,3.9157,9.5979,1.8165,5.3635,2.42,5.696,0.2085,1.7795,2.4077,0.6331,1.4847,2.2714,4.5701,5.3823,4.0596,2.9045,3.2739,0.396,0.0044,4.0194,0.1516,5.5415,2.1609,3.6943,0.7113]}

Once I played it I never gave up on it and never did. It's perfect for me, I would recommend it to anyone.\nGameplay is perfect like puzzle games, but for me it was just a point and click game. If your like puzzle you will love this game. The graphics a very nice and addicting and I think this might be a must to buy game by anyone.\nI like all the graphics, the story, the gameplay, I liked the fact you had to think and choose which is the direction you want to go. I think this might be a classic if the game can be done on my phone. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle because the game is full of mind games and I think anyone can do this game because the instructions are easy to follow.\nPuzzle games are my favorite type of games because you need to find a way to overcome the problems that you are faced with as you progress in the game. With this game you will have to think to build a bridge between the two islands and collect all of these stones. The more you travel around the islands the better the game will be and the more puzzles you need to solve. The graphics are also very nice and the colorful theme is also very nice and addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle or just to have a nice break from the day to day worries.","token_len":350,"entropy":[9.9645,0.0801,3.2488,1.1358,7.4902,6.9027,2.5035,4.7461,6.182,8.5167,5.9604,1.8382,2.8161,5.9391,0.3575,0.596,10.2873,1.0135,5.1611,1.6642,4.1824,8.1971,2.7391,4.6542,0.113,2.3468,4.8295,7.7875,1.3204,2.1744,4.3819,0.2283,3.4774,0.2621,1.3109,2.9778,7.3832,0.3918,0.3152,5.5072,8.9883,2.62,6.8291,0.9338,2.1603,2.7599,5.3744,1.6908,2.7015,4.7952,5.026,9.601,6.9654,6.5873,0.3661,5.0296,1.2745,1.2361,0.8688,6.3216,1.4297,1.0583,5.8,1.977,4.7715,0.6891,3.2309,0.4193,6.9762,4.1398,2.096,0.6453,1.0299,5.1357,4.6315,0.6087,1.1163,0.9121,2.5149,3.9465,4.3714,1.4654,2.1331,1.4834,5.1433,0.5009,2.9342,2.6484,1.6524,4.2642,1.3007,0.6083,0.7325,0.5767,1.2348,2.1382,16.5296,2.6927,5.7615,6.7459,7.4723,1.0922,1.6789,2.4845,5.0864,2.2985,1.2969,2.3251,2.9455,1.8828,7.2629,1.7483,0.0275,1.1138,0.6581,4.0139,5.0053,5.7234,2.7968,6.2224,1.699,1.3337,1.0342,0.2116,0.5552,3.0819,3.3183,7.8379,3.9798,1.8233,2.1832,6.3117,0.163,4.7279,3.2154,3.1046,2.6065,4.9421,0.4049,2.3797,3.6468,4.5027,2.4345,4.6774,6.0787,2.8257,0.4195,1.0186,2.5844,3.8618,4.8213,0.8185,4.0895,1.9201,2.2867,4.1106,1.8665,1.0038,3.713,1.4639,3.7947,3.8563,0.9137,4.8105,3.1706,4.2604,0.6699,5.1932,3.2754,4.5935,2.6863,5.0016,1.4598,7.551,0.8436,1.3327,0.285,0.494,1.0576,1.7117,2.6197,1.503,2.8186,0.2076,0.9149,6.2851,5.1072,3.241,1.7757,4.6058,1.039,4.3376,2.9856,5.6272,3.7446,0.8443,2.1392,2.5597,0.7441,1.0391,0.4743,0.7009,0.3419,2.4741,1.2174,0.987,7.5133,2.6474,1.4815,0.8888,5.7561,0.1075,9.2619,1.9621,1.4035,3.112,1.6957,7.2207,1.9543,2.9639,1.4038,0.5978,5.084,2.2939,7.3984,0.5478,2.0642,0.4293,0.8231,0.5482,0.9586,5.9546,1.9468,1.6235,0.726,4.3696,0.7156,4.1098,0.0982,1.1836,2.4295,2.349,3.3686,0.3036,3.918,2.3206,1.4772,0.1975,6.2921,2.5091,4.3272,2.408,0.8756,1.7974,2.027,0.3355,4.6548,0.9597,3.2732,3.4059,0.8297,0.0789,0.2138,5.5131,1.3105,0.3894,1.059,2.4387,1.8074,0.651,3.3694,4.0369,6.9144,1.5151,4.0285,2.5692,1.3858,1.9179,4.965,1.7159,6.0972,3.1145,2.5096,3.7908,7.4083,0.9282,1.9947,4.6629,0.7577,6.2334,4.6505,0.887,1.6672,0.9452,1.735,1.7964,2.0844,0.8864,1.3005,2.3461,1.2722,0.4641,3.6164,0.3512,3.558,0.1865,0.306,0.4657,2.3332,4.1243,0.6014,4.1232,1.3188,1.0447,0.8468,1.7237,7.4927,5.069,1.6081,3.6842,0.9574,1.8212,2.5658,3.4314,0.1795,1.8311,1.7405,0.3623,0.2831,0.2579,0.2604,0.1788,0.4085,0.3715,0.3593,4.563,3.3137,3.7071,2.9773,1.5518,2.9712,4.7152,0.9869,1.1587,5.7103,0.5464,0.0565,8.7682,0.8188]}

This song makes me think of where it all started, When I had everything that I wanted and nothing that I had wanted. This song has made me strong. It's a song I've always known from my earliest years. All I know is that you gave me hope. This was the moment when we lost it all and the fear of the unknown began to get us down. I was so afraid of life that I began to hide. Your love was my strength and your life was mine. But when I said goodbye I felt the heaviness in my eyes and the guilt in my chest. I promised you things I couldn't keep and told you my fears, but I promised you something too... that I was here for you always and that it would never be too far for you to call. I'm so glad that you were here for me, that my life wouldn't be the same without you know, I thank you God for taking so many other things into His hand, but you gave me this gift and you give it to me without a doubt. God, thank you for making me strong and for giving me more than I could ever ask or imagine. I'm so glad that you were here for me, that my life would be the same without you know, God, you gave me this gift and you give it to me with a true heart.

{"prompt":"Humanity and an invading alien race agree to settle the war with a weaponless , to-the-death , one-on-one fight between their best martial artists .","text":"Humanity and an invading alien race agree to settle the war with a weaponless, to-the-death, one-on-one fight between their best martial artists. They must kill each other in a game played with the weight of an atomic bomb that will destroy anyone they kill \u2026 including they playing with someone they love. The game begins.\nThe game begins and each lives to wonder in the end what life without rules was all about. When I picked up this movie it looked like a buddy cop movie. It wasn\u2019t a buddy cop movie. It more resembled one in which these martial artists face off in a final showdown. The rules of the game are made up of rules created by the two heroes. The war itself is not an external force they are created a game as part of their lives. At the end of the movie as the rules of the game are destroyed a question arises will they be destroyed as well or can something be created as a result of their destruction? This is a question many martial artists ask themselves in their lifetime.\nThe movie was better when I thought it was a buddy cop movie. In retrospect the movie should have ended with a character falling to his death. There is no need to be happy and smile as he lives to a new life. That would have destroyed the whole experience and had he lived that would have only been a small step forward for him. There is a line in the movie something about the idea that what he loved was more important than his life. I suppose we must keep in mind what we love is not just life. When we are faced with love in death, in this case we may ask what was more important what the love was or the person who loved us.","token_len":350,"entropy":[7.4121,3.0963,7.0151,10.4944,3.4675,1.4494,11.6188,1.0467,4.2074,2.1021,4.818,3.5758,2.889,7.8628,6.5124,2.6268,8.5432,2.7562,2.2558,0.0252,4.4972,3.3604,5.8746,0.296,4.1543,0.0005,0.025,3.2282,3.7459,3.5851,4.9238,7.8483,0.7024,0.9191,4.0437,3.2992,5.5188,1.7373,0.0132,2.0991,1.651,4.5316,4.6147,2.5797,2.4627,7.7719,0.0693,3.9164,4.4121,0.0951,4.4006,2.03,2.1273,5.7227,2.5919,3.4717,8.1736,6.0398,6.5767,10.4338,2.5064,7.2309,2.1741,1.9663,0.6833,2.7953,2.0104,3.3291,4.9966,1.1215,8.4432,1.945,1.7337,4.8291,6.0441,9.0096,3.236,10.2295,5.5923,1.0035,4.6852,1.8363,4.1519,5.2636,7.3696,5.0759,3.7837,0.0242,0.3844,4.774,4.4621,6.599,0.2744,2.393,8.1826,3.9051,4.9682,0.6489,1.5684,8.2095,3.0072,0.9747,0.9818,2.0922,3.9561,16.0322,7.5934,1.4302,2.1298,1.5998,0.0019,0.1501,1.0475,0.6627,9.1107,3.2004,5.0744,3.8449,0.0979,6.0137,7.7876,0.3066,5.2911,0.9118,2.1724,0.6705,5.9045,1.6438,1.6864,2.0403,4.9248,2.3789,0.6635,0.2026,1.1313,5.9481,1.2897,0.3669,2.2112,6.7984,0.5176,1.4239,5.3572,4.7242,1.6968,1.5459,6.9007,6.1567,0.6745,3.2563,2.9293,8.0649,3.3944,7.9469,1.9257,6.9374,7.0644,5.5907,6.5012,3.7079,0.0049,1.2835,4.3063,0.5105,5.7668,0.9506,0.3953,0.2723,0.2631,1.3915,7.1017,1.2659,4.6448,1.9563,0.3542,0.1352,0.6265,5.6125,3.9824,7.216,0.926,8.6527,1.3597,2.6248,5.7006,3.6085,1.0364,3.4317,4.9625,7.8912,1.5229,3.317,4.0888,0.8813,2.0857,0.6462,1.8521,4.0589,0.8664,3.392,0.975,1.6,1.4183,4.1889,1.3146,0.1436,2.6286,0.2801,2.7641,1.461,5.3962,0.4909,1.9276,1.5994,2.3887,3.8232,7.7166,3.3509,1.4022,4.7591,1.381,0.3553,1.2891,1.0005,0.0017,0.1008,0.4899,4.1818,5.2805,2.8115,0.8178,3.729,0.297,4.6124,1.8289,1.4233,5.5192,6.6918,2.6772,0.7681,0.1379,1.4213,4.1116,1.1753,1.2914,4.1457,0.4847,4.1672,5.6061,3.269,6.371,3.056,4.5574,5.9239,1.9643,5.1611,3.2768,0.9635,0.7229,4.2599,3.277,0.5337,7.1274,0.8741,3.1197,3.6935,2.5648,4.529,3.4788,2.5456,3.5175,4.7143,0.1798,6.1898,2.4025,1.8948,3.6612,4.5599,1.6912,1.7071,1.3657,0.3371,4.026,0.6553,1.722,5.2551,1.2439,0.2013,0.3677,9.5991,2.4552,1.8444,5.1334,1.2556,5.0483,4.0581,5.7777,2.5782,3.9319,0.2454,0.1799,2.1623,1.9598,0.7097,2.714,5.7131,3.7505,4.7105,5.2986,1.8209,0.0173,3.6347,2.6502,2.6513,3.4205,1.9767,2.6008,4.3043,3.03,4.9795,1.3338,2.0783,4.9995,0.0313,5.144,3.3434,4.4494,1.9637,5.0881,3.4277,3.1815,2.1176,3.6814,4.884,2.8423,4.2079,2.3969,0.0658,7.9953,3.6062,3.6076,1.7482,4.1758,2.9408,4.2124,1.6463,0.9086,2.6106,0.9292]}

{"prompt":"A burned shack under a dark sky","text":"A burned shack under a dark sky to a light one over a tree-lined path. The latter is the setting for the novel. A man goes into the woods to retrieve a dog who is lost. He stumbles over a body in shackles that isn\u2019t his dog\u2019s and has nowhere to be. Now that\u2019s something; a man has just lost his dog and has no place to be. He calls out, \u201cHelp?\u201d and the body speaks for him. I think I should have checked out the audiobook and listened to it before starting this book. It was just as engrossing as reading the book.\nOnce the prologue is over, we go into the story of a lost man in the woods and, in this case, with a dog. The man is on the move, but he has no clue where he is and what is real and what isn\u2019t. This book is a study of the human mind\u2014why do people act the way they do? And one way that he figures out to deal with this unbelievable situation is to put himself in the position of the corpse in the shackles. It\u2019s like a cop shows the guy a dead body covered in blood: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna think you\u2019re in trouble again, ain\u2019t you?\u201d As it turns out, the corpse is the real culprit and he just needs to know how to deal with it.\nThe suspense is unrelenting. But, above all else, this novel is about human beings. The man isn\u2019t just another victim: he\u2019s human. And his humanity shines through in every line and every page.","token_len":350,"entropy":[11.3251,9.4474,6.3475,1.924,6.5016,2.8625,5.9968,2.8994,6.2466,7.6572,5.8114,1.4864,5.7469,5.2245,0.4031,2.538,0.937,2.1234,8.1511,2.0705,2.1496,6.2065,0.5508,1.3001,4.4631,2.7931,3.8806,3.4812,6.1318,2.3369,0.9891,2.7193,1.7377,3.6408,0.9929,5.7371,4.2999,2.0575,4.7587,1.8191,1.6003,6.6835,0.1065,4.3638,0.8999,5.0571,3.6848,10.5086,0.7016,3.2589,5.917,16.3095,7.5598,3.095,4.4837,5.1899,1.3422,0.0851,3.4229,3.754,4.9682,6.2104,0.202,3.4285,2.6166,6.1402,2.6447,7.2426,0.2278,0.5027,6.1138,6.3099,2.254,2.6228,2.8794,4.2757,3.2733,0.6686,0.8996,1.4289,2.5895,1.5601,1.5358,0.2938,1.9529,0.4838,2.2032,5.1279,1.876,2.4873,2.9045,5.0896,9.6029,4.5778,0.1441,5.9689,3.4247,1.9528,5.2757,6.2889,3.403,0.8248,0.4619,5.416,3.2664,1.6976,4.1186,2.9044,5.6368,2.878,1.0702,9.6855,0.0422,3.0327,4.5506,0.4584,0.7361,2.5071,4.3282,1.8699,3.9614,0.5999,2.7048,2.0353,3.8314,3.8688,7.7587,0.0061,0.0086,0.7114,4.533,1.253,1.7845,1.0979,2.5736,8.2229,1.8865,7.6029,0.0001,1.3283,1.2401,0.3742,2.5773,3.3822,2.1513,0.6759,3.1334,1.9161,2.7324,5.154,2.5532,3.1199,1.3328,0.3578,2.7884,5.2359,2.7106,3.2017,1.0515,0.044,5.1531,1.7408,1.6185,0.8395,1.7252,2.2585,1.5679,5.1178,1.2589,4.7942,1.364,2.7131,1.5188,2.2599,1.4868,4.313,1.6107,0.4216,0.2632,2.3402,3.1207,2.9694,7.6762,2.3623,0.5754,3.8503,3.803,0.7382,0.0633,0.5666,3.546,3.3851,0.8694,2.2323,6.6055,1.0701,1.787,1.9389,1.6776,4.3497,5.723,1.6488,2.9193,4.758,2.2279,0.0194,0.1928,0.0769,0.8108,3.1429,5.5522,3.4817,2.8023,3.9254,7.1916,0.4684,3.6242,5.7132,0.022,1.3269,9.8778,0.7139,0.2702,1.0662,4.6252,2.5352,0.8406,1.2748,2.1421,0.4866,2.1795,9.2425,3.6138,0.8854,3.3008,0.7522,0.9754,3.0328,3.7178,0.1781,0.0269,4.4586,1.4963,7.1892,5.0379,2.9977,4.0086,1.7077,4.8984,1.2142,7.5211,0.3526,1.5369,5.2376,2.8926,1.3108,3.6953,2.4464,1.2219,1.2094,4.0401,5.8378,2.6187,2.282,0.3722,0.7639,4.2751,3.4782,5.8025,2.0194,5.3396,0.9248,0.206,0.6637,0.5491,0.332,2.0459,3.0162,5.302,3.4526,1.1324,0.0004,0.1,1.5034,4.0375,0.9127,2.4625,3.5497,4.6774,2.6227,2.2331,4.9835,2.4527,0.238,4.3076,2.8519,0.2343,1.5435,0.0099,0.5608,0.3779,1.3193,1.8814,8.3832,1.4843,7.3653,0.0331,1.314,4.9182,2.4775,6.5354,0.0327,0.8562,0.0253,2.2118,1.9454,0.7767,2.4033,2.7144,1.6778,1.1427,2.2919,2.7208,5.2612,0.6768,0.3847,0.001,4.054,3.6763,3.5255,4.7441,0.8543,0.9161,0.0332,0.026,3.5184,0.6967,2.4733,4.0253,4.0298,4.9625,0.1626,1.3622,3.2803,3.5923,2.9343,2.0175,5.1748,0.63]}

The dialogue is quite interesting. Some of the best parts of the book are the ones where he is trying to talk to Kendra and he is trying to build a relationship with them. But, on the whole, the story -which is quite slow in beginning and middle and very fast in the last third of the book -is not something I would have enjoyed.","token_len":351,"entropy":[9.9962,12.0457,3.6409,9.557,4.7167,2.3538,3.2468,5.7549,1.0148,9.5592,0.0342,4.6181,1.9748,6.4673,4.8198,1.6819,0.0906,0.0007,1.4922,4.6988,2.5412,5.3,1.7522,2.2726,5.8711,2.7844,5.6829,4.8259,2.3485,3.6107,3.6816,0.0009,3.8067,2.9533,0.4508,5.1528,2.4432,1.677,3.9915,4.1354,5.9078,6.0383,3.5181,5.1849,4.7315,2.3177,6.1936,4.7598,6.9037,4.5551,0.2629,2.2912,4.1468,5.8527,6.0785,0.6004,2.3586,2.6684,2.27,4.3402,2.2916,2.0497,2.2651,1.5733,0.0738,0.8613,3.1984,3.2577,0.6952,3.6733,2.7133,1.9207,2.5616,0.8075,4.3078,3.6982,4.9218,2.7344,3.9442,2.9392,3.7932,3.2052,1.0315,5.1134,7.3261,3.0451,0.813,3.7092,4.0775,0.1131,0.5591,2.2562,0.8993,2.345,6.7187,1.8335,2.0261,2.7025,1.7017,0.1042,4.2315,2.749,3.823,1.6001,3.1688,4.6064,8.9309,0.1167,4.1252,1.1737,5.0891,1.6161,3.3877,3.5956,0.006,3.8712,9.907,1.8215,2.0449,4.177,1.9301,0.411,5.5161,7.5121,3.694,2.3232,4.3336,1.5912,3.2227,1.6762,8.018,0.4208,1.3036,4.476,0.7712,5.6719,1.4338,1.1001,0.1334,4.3323,6.5034,4.1631,2.4875,3.312,4.0804,1.0525,1.7188,1.6345,1.7723,0.6671,3.144,4.8315,3.647,2.1133,1.1415,2.8799,7.936,1.5304,1.6531,6.3225,0.0739,0.2299,1.6372,4.7265,0.2909,3.8788,0.3666,1.6776,2.5063,7.5417,4.6408,3.6214,0.5735,2.0711,0.7765,0.4035,4.5222,2.6883,1.371,0.6126,3.302,4.6389,4.6073,5.9162,1.439,0.5119,3.1185,2.7133,5.7222,3.6658,0.8844,2.4549,1.8213,1.703,5.9787,3.6391,7.1758,1.5478,3.6642,0.0018,3.3221,5.4611,0.5315,2.8589,1.1187,1.2856,4.759,4.9053,2.5996,4.61,3.9072,4.6292,3.9628,0.1504,1.0882,5.9527,5.9655,0.0215,0.0009,4.5318,1.3823,5.9247,0.7478,4.5676,2.0968,3.1747,6.6848,3.6564,1.5949,1.6031,2.9896,4.1589,1.2828,3.9018,1.5111,4.7563,1.9366,1.39,5.8341,3.5665,0.3473,1.8853,2.4886,5.3742,3.433,13.1946,3.2643,3.5971,1.0201,4.9938,1.7494,3.7579,2.9649,1.3396,4.1549,3.7176,2.6322,1.123,0.9212,3.9897,1.844,6.3511,1.3106,5.7351,2.4277,1.5874,5.7825,0.158,6.8169,0.8269,4.4366,0.628,2.3291,5.4664,2.3485,0.4261,0.4834,2.2701,6.4373,1.0776,4.3448,2.6931,2.8474,5.023,0.5306,0.3153,4.2425,3.3394,1.0819,0.367,0.8076,0.7253,1.346,2.9998,0.9177,1.4769,2.3053,3.0607,0.0639,4.2865,0.5676,9.6972,0.4094,2.062,4.3104,1.7817,2.5227,0.0694,6.1311,1.2909,1.7223,0.259,5.1393,0.9052,2.6684,3.2788,4.8084,0.3559,1.1551,0.2191,1.449,2.9656,6.5429,3.4097,1.1106,3.9549,6.5587,2.4491,6.3854,1.8089,4.0574,4.0179,3.2562,4.5144,0.5091,2.1807,3.4125,4.2093,0.7656,0.0692,0.3296,0.2764,1.6117,2.9252,5.6929,1.2291,0.845,1.8185,3.3388,1.6786]}

Write an Educational Video for our kids who will one day be using it. That\u2019s what is needed. To have the courage to move ahead.\nYour article reminds of the old story about the man who found the time capsule. Some time ago a man found a time capsule and he found out after a while that the date on it was December 1st 1776. Before that date America was under the influence of the British and not yet a single person, even a king was in America. So what was the point of the man in finding such a time capsule?\nIf there is a time travel device, and the time of the man is changed, he will never find out that it is a time travel capsule and that the world changed after he found it\nAs I understand a good way for making sure our world is safe and we can move forward is that the creator of time travel device must be an adult to be able to change the world. It just seems that is not the case in Time travel stories.\nIt just seems that in a time travel story, the main character usually turns out to be an adult, when they need to change the present, they need to use a device where an old version of their own self lives in the present, that person will then need special skills to change the world and then the old version of themselves goes back and dies.\nI don\u2019t think the main creator of a time travel device needs to be an adult at all. Some kind of device like time travel machines might be enough to change the world, and they don\u2019t need to use special skills or an old version of themselves.","token_len":351,"entropy":[2.8744,1.6055,12.506,3.1685,6.4634,2.7051,0.8921,5.376,1.2351,1.2306,9.8758,1.2789,1.2051,1.4844,11.151,4.2111,10.6379,5.1417,2.6534,6.3738,4.4746,5.4572,3.5467,7.4345,0.0062,1.3056,6.0188,2.7343,1.5734,5.8798,18.4134,7.427,3.6416,1.7625,4.3973,3.1494,1.018,6.3158,4.282,2.6067,5.3601,0.1792,5.3395,4.2845,2.6426,1.7251,9.7379,7.2238,6.3235,5.4147,1.3134,5.3191,3.5264,1.3284,1.628,5.4262,0.508,4.5733,2.0808,4.5676,3.5181,2.413,6.2325,2.8225,1.6984,3.8622,1.6852,3.6421,1.1725,1.6742,0.2222,2.0457,3.8192,3.5191,2.4154,6.6821,2.005,1.3845,0.6321,1.9084,7.5246,3.498,0.4683,0.5544,5.3818,3.0585,0.7567,6.0185,2.5819,0.3858,6.5471,1.8127,2.298,8.9867,1.0832,4.2985,1.3897,2.1052,0.0171,1.4874,3.3666,2.54,5.256,4.1359,3.1973,6.4374,1.854,4.9196,3.6425,1.7722,5.6828,4.111,2.8938,3.7658,0.4993,2.8771,3.3585,2.058,1.1464,2.9936,0.3619,1.6109,2.8202,3.6657,7.4035,4.9363,0.2829,1.2011,0.1647,0.5901,1.8187,4.4709,3.3014,0.8846,1.4866,1.9882,2.6092,3.9672,1.6439,3.7231,2.6525,2.2073,5.0329,0.8664,1.7594,2.2228,5.2477,1.3883,3.1793,1.8313,3.9801,2.7914,2.7626,2.9418,2.0614,1.0361,2.361,1.2385,1.1554,9.7603,3.1324,2.2721,2.1595,4.2276,4.8359,3.9174,1.8871,1.1215,0.5319,5.5957,4.9518,2.8698,4.0776,6.7603,5.1575,4.3236,4.289,7.7095,3.5113,3.5273,4.3946,0.8337,2.2233,1.5153,3.5549,2.6809,3.4185,0.4285,4.4217,3.2354,2.702,6.0277,0.517,2.8219,0.1258,3.5211,3.808,1.6891,3.9232,3.52,4.9519,2.7608,0.6574,0.0268,4.123,1.2269,2.7986,0.9588,3.5773,5.7381,2.3655,1.5596,4.8475,1.2754,1.4548,0.3955,3.3682,7.7506,2.9646,5.3962,0.5835,1.3523,3.9237,4.6279,0.2392,0.3152,4.1263,2.8976,2.4703,0.4537,0.4354,1.343,1.268,4.4464,0.7483,7.027,5.289,1.6663,0.1307,0.0889,1.9269,0.3571,2.0954,5.2778,3.0973,4.578,0.5637,2.2873,0.7467,6.9595,2.4287,2.5387,1.5116,0.2232,4.7011,1.8751,2.7192,5.4475,5.1758,3.7477,6.1397,0.3064,2.8893,3.6569,4.9876,4.6389,1.8055,1.1808,0.5886,1.7484,3.987,4.5823,2.896,4.5063,3.7412,8.4289,5.086,0.9382,1.8188,0.5318,1.392,2.4013,3.9142,2.3478,4.5314,1.5368,1.0117,2.4572,5.4915,1.6717,2.582,5.3541,0.8463,1.1164,2.7342,3.1461,4.9909,0.4014,0.1009,1.3871,3.0169,3.7941,8.3733,0.6523,3.0055,0.924,0.1345,0.0761,2.515,0.3094,0.6065,0.7003,0.0722,4.4168,0.0842,0.6648,5.2978,5.0404,0.0212,3.6305,3.286,3.895,0.6245,5.8171,4.008,1.0478,5.2464,1.0843,1.5917,0.4929,0.7221,1.6876,2.6519,3.624,4.0292,0.3546,0.2338,0.0106,0.748,0.5109,4.6221,4.6267,0.3242,2.6916,5.5444,1.5389,0.745,0.1196,0.6603,1.326]}

{"prompt":"The Statues","text":"The Statuesque House of Death in the Japanese Art Exhibition at the National Gallery\nAfter lunch and some free time while the museum is closed, take the elevator to the 12th floor. This is where the Japanese Art Exhibition is housed. I spent a total of about 3 hours in this museum and it contained 2,500 pieces. It was a very rich collection. Most of the work was very old.\nI can\u2019t say you have to go to the 14th floor to look at this collection. It\u2019s mostly uppers to look at but you can see a good bit from the 12th floor.\nI liked the paintings but I found some of the stuff on the walls interesting too. One painting I particularly liked was of a family out for a stroll and looking through the windows of a house at a lake. The people are all dressed in kimonos.\nThe collection consists nearly entirely of paintings, sculptures and bronzes from Edo. You also have an interesting section of Chinese porcelain and some Japanese paper. I liked the paper though which is so thin, it looks like glass. The wallpaper that they installed there reminded me of the ones we had at home.\nThe museum is open on weekends and holidays, and as of September 1, is open 24 hours a day. The address for the museum is 3-30-31 Shimbashi, Shibuya.\nI wish I could say I had done a lot more but I think I only really got to see a fraction of what was available.\nThe food option is only 3 choices. I believe it's at least 3 or 4 different stations though. But you can't really order and pay at those stations until you sit down.","token_len":352,"entropy":[10.4932,3.2049,5.8223,5.1549,1.6553,8.0455,4.1124,2.4094,8.2471,5.9523,6.0342,1.9736,0.9049,2.6891,1.4809,4.6238,9.1187,7.7399,3.879,4.9001,6.8915,3.5412,6.2765,2.526,3.1292,2.5729,2.5664,0.5627,7.3685,2.0343,3.2694,0.7954,0.3885,6.7794,0.2011,0.306,2.0292,3.8965,1.0696,0.9104,1.6552,4.4293,3.2138,1.4049,1.7533,2.4104,0.5199,5.7443,4.7394,1.612,5.0521,0.0041,2.5139,3.607,0.2611,1.6779,1.8492,2.1127,2.4942,2.2948,7.8152,5.2257,1.9618,2.31,1.3168,2.0678,2.7285,1.0776,1.6606,2.3571,6.2694,2.9349,1.9428,5.1988,0.2253,0.5562,4.1305,1.0057,4.1557,4.2508,2.3781,3.084,2.6951,4.6976,16.0389,7.4401,0.9611,1.9271,5.6239,3.1332,1.3097,2.0466,1.3803,1.0136,5.8665,0.0099,0.2019,1.0613,4.2108,0.2542,2.2802,2.137,0.5209,1.9692,4.8073,0.1805,0.1205,6.5058,10.5594,5.8844,5.2632,2.4249,0.1019,3.9622,2.6437,1.4504,3.0604,2.3874,4.4211,4.1188,4.7184,0.6079,5.3493,0.047,0.2783,0.6434,1.5862,2.4772,6.3818,0.831,3.7094,3.9411,1.6009,3.9952,2.0336,1.8044,0.6188,5.5191,3.959,0.4441,3.3781,3.9236,3.708,0.1436,3.9654,3.4581,2.3587,6.9089,0.5791,0.5012,3.2749,1.1779,6.8297,7.1657,2.8902,0.8196,2.5734,2.6619,5.2722,2.1141,0.8047,2.613,2.0781,1.6763,1.8132,4.4714,3.1936,4.1333,0.581,2.2489,4.7959,3.0803,3.4269,4.0576,1.0644,5.1329,0.2417,1.2188,1.5591,1.3356,1.8835,4.0915,3.3819,9.8046,2.0774,0.013,2.8486,2.3798,3.4057,0.8421,9.1711,0.005,2.6026,9.4144,0.199,2.4684,3.9291,5.4209,1.2221,4.0147,2.9429,4.7081,1.0114,6.2419,4.8465,0.0074,0.0039,2.0669,3.2446,3.913,6.0633,1.3572,2.3882,3.8131,0.8832,3.7215,4.8481,5.6405,1.4096,5.3404,5.4929,3.2086,1.6899,3.0471,1.0452,5.7058,0.6539,2.3947,6.4293,5.1807,4.3369,6.1291,4.4185,5.9682,0.0244,0.2856,1.3957,5.2592,3.6931,2.2802,2.1684,4.4154,0.5052,0.7163,1.5556,2.1621,1.159,2.3775,3.508,2.8627,1.1058,3.9933,2.1928,2.2299,5.4252,2.8908,4.0593,2.54,1.2035,6.1463,0.7378,4.2206,0.1705,0.3949,0.002,0.5391,2.3914,7.4614,3.2956,0.4696,0.6394,0.1899,5.1615,2.586,5.2472,1.2981,5.9348,5.8423,5.4615,4.4775,2.5604,3.2793,1.5485,0.0042,1.5632,0.9591,2.6906,4.5908,0.9029,0.7247,1.4298,2.0663,2.9257,4.908,2.0459,1.3098,1.4807,5.8109,0.8257,3.0686,1.2286,4.4446,4.0212,2.7769,1.0489,0.8103,1.9677,4.4498,0.052,1.9009,2.4629,4.3292,1.2078,1.875,2.055,7.2257,8.2397,1.0672,5.8438,5.4695,5.8565,1.3574,1.8903,6.5842,2.1397,3.2779,5.0905,1.5466,2.667,3.4629,0.1362,1.7448,8.1675,6.3534,0.6803,5.5319,3.143,0.8194,3.9601,2.1788,3.3828,5.5107,4.5985,2.8591,5.0817,1.122,5.1464,1.1863,5.9648,0.7444,1.2132]}

Those who perused improving the human race through genetic enhancement and gene splicing and those who sought to improve themselves through technology ( Cyborgs ). These two factions continue to war, but after the war ends mankind has progressed to the point the entire civilizations on both sides of the conflict are completely assimilated, except for one.\nThe only people who know that the two factions have merged to some degree is the people who call themselves the Dark Faction. This group is extremely powerful and they maintain secrets that even the Light side does not know. The Dark Faction do not hide their secret in the dark and rather keep it inside of each individual.

He is the only member of his family who is able to connect with the Dark Faction. His powers are growing with each experience he feels while he tries to escape The Oversoul. Through this experience many questions begin to arise in his mind. Who am I? Where is my family? Why are they here?\nHearing the other group speak about The Eternal Palace caused the young boy to want to escape. When he begins to explore the palace he begins to question every decision he has made. At what point do you let The Oversoul control you.

Your life depends on asking permission before you get through the door, and somehow you pull it off every time. Until that day when you get asked, two weeks before your daughter's birthday - you know your only way out is to stay in and survive.\nOne of the better books of the year. I can't emphasize enough how fantastic it is. This isn't some light, breezy science fiction novel, with a bit of supernatural drama thrown into the mix. Instead, the book is fast-paced and action-packed, and it's written with a skill that would make even the most accomplished SF writer proud. Kudos to the author for creating such a perfect blend of realism and fantasy, without ever losing sight of what makes this a truly excellent story. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves fast-paced, gritty action, and excellent character development combined with a little bit of weird.\nI've read a few (many) books by this author and enjoyed them. This book, although not as high of a mark as prior ones, still was entertaining, but not as entertaining as I hoped it would be. It was a little slow, there were many characters and some events are just a little overplayed or exaggerated, there are very few twists and turns, and the overall story seems a little too contrived to be believable. The pacing of the book is so slow it makes up for the lackluster storyline. It would have been better spent as a short story, book, or novella. It's not a terrible read, but the characters, some of the plot events, the writing style, and the direction the story takes leave much to be desired.","token_len":355,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,11.3384,0.6401,1.3594,4.0359,4.9276,7.2195,3.1398,7.9852,2.8251,1.6517,2.4986,10.3136,1.1699,4.0258,3.9701,2.6348,0.0782,10.1818,5.5583,3.5961,1.0315,3.8824,6.8101,1.6428,1.5102,2.3786,1.1695,7.958,1.3962,7.1863,1.916,0.196,7.0459,0.398,0.5479,7.0618,3.1647,2.1778,2.372,0.5561,2.5896,4.455,2.4502,9.078,5.0633,2.3798,1.9831,6.767,1.4559,0.8489,5.6942,1.7527,3.2547,3.9019,5.3902,3.0159,1.1106,0.6564,0.4176,4.6789,1.9591,5.8116,5.4168,0.6636,2.3568,7.1689,1.3677,0.4242,6.7008,5.1819,3.7149,1.0773,1.4627,2.3975,2.4823,3.8262,0.5363,5.9709,0.8593,0.3588,5.4886,1.165,0.0534,0.6893,3.7627,5.1359,0.0007,3.9023,7.1737,4.2003,6.5268,0.0533,4.3819,0.276,1.5183,1.5241,4.6023,1.4067,4.602,0.0823,5.5551,4.5232,4.0432,3.0654,0.9393,0.0146,0.3115,3.8467,0.3943,2.5208,1.6849,0.7324,8.05,1.7075,0.0321,1.2043,3.761,0.4641,0.0515,0.8773,2.0634,2.0029,1.324,5.3908,1.1789,1.5,6.5637,1.6317,4.2949,1.1982,4.1317,1.3945,0.7258,4.3158,7.2017,1.4861,3.1023,0.1409,7.8136,1.5162,0.226,2.0101,0.9436,0.4932,3.8217,2.2286,0.3717,5.6772,2.6172,0.0825,4.3815,0.1636,3.4763,1.8036,4.912,4.6285,3.9472,1.1626,0.0031,2.2109,1.4308,2.5299,2.013,2.8224,4.7927,3.3684,0.2851,3.057,3.4932,2.1258,0.0422,1.1083,1.4277,0.7762,1.0417,2.6444,6.3339,0.3944,0.0088,1.4639,5.4251,1.3161,1.6993,1.3977,7.4999,3.0165,0.4271,9.0401,0.0043,1.4157,4.5875,1.5614,0.0227,6.7498,4.9832,1.0631,2.842,2.4046,1.506,1.8538,1.753,6.7947,4.0389,1.1234,1.211,2.2227,2.8592,0.2864,3.2379,5.37,1.2935,2.1394,3.276,2.9185,3.7345,5.2432,2.1452,1.6497,5.1795,4.8613,0.3404,6.3249,0.3392,9.3571,2.9221,0.2002,2.7624,5.3696,4.3363,2.2833,4.0881,2.4096,1.5583,4.3223,0.1696,3.0364,4.1794,0.8477,0.0966,0.1041,0.109,2.3279,2.1016,2.0823,2.791,3.8735,1.7251,5.8142,0.6042,4.6869,4.3549,3.0673,2.9925,6.5689,6.3558,3.6027,2.8051,0.8209,3.8513,4.4422,3.8168,4.4543,0.9557,4.7424,1.8386,4.7032,0.5069,4.4196,1.4244,0.1798,1.0724,0.3051,1.6578,4.2119,1.3355,5.4889,2.7623,0.5191,1.6201,6.7509,0.0052,1.9245,0.6574,4.4654,0.4689,2.1432,3.2383,2.4507,0.5341,0.6419,1.1501,3.9123,1.7531,2.2903,2.5186,5.3388,0.0909,1.4993,6.367,4.793,1.64,2.384,3.6786,1.3839,0.2144,2.1112,5.3859,4.3092,0.3583,3.4933,0.6131,1.1705,8.4762,2.9,0.2525,5.4114,3.2456,0.3173,1.1785,2.7548,1.0983,2.0742,1.5872,4.7989,2.5733,0.5683,0.4855,3.2063,4.256,2.8787,4.8934,0.475,1.4776,2.3983,6.9592,0.1495,2.7881,3.4248,2.8762,0.2971,0.3351,0.6212,6.5462,3.601,1.5808,0.5612,5.4717,3.8176,0.075,0.0173,0.0048,0.1961]}

One day at an intersection where he always turns right, he sees a billboard that has a picture of his wife and daughter and reads `` Turn left, Steve ''. Does he go right? Read the article.\nA child born with down syndrome could very well feel the same pain and anger that any of us would at being misunderstood.\nThe first sign that there is something different about a child with down syndrome usually occurs during the first year of life, when the child is between one and three years old.. A child with D.S. often has some difficulties communicating verbally, and may be less able to control his or her emotions. One of the most common features is the characteristic movements, which include jerky movements of the arms and legs and the unusual head position. The movement disorder is a response to nervousness and irritability. Some children with Downs might turn or rock their head in a manner that resembles \u201cwaving\u201d or \u201cplaying the trombone.\u201d This is a movement that many people who are nervous take without realizing that it is not what it seems. Others with DS tend to have unusual ways of putting the body through motion. Some children with Down Syndrome will rock their whole body; some swing or jump; while others will be more graceful. For all you baby boomers remember the games of \u201cwho dun kno wut?\u201d.\nIn a study carried out in a University there was seen that among the normal people and in children with Down syndrome there are many people who can hear when a person talks by means of the phoneme, which means the sound of speech, but in order to understand a conversation they have to follow the context of a conversation..","token_len":356,"entropy":[8.5455,1.9686,5.2798,3.4636,3.145,4.9949,5.4168,0.308,0.9889,5.6071,1.6345,4.1116,4.6399,4.2315,4.3906,1.7776,5.9276,5.6831,2.5728,1.1648,0.8967,2.7501,0.9732,5.906,2.107,5.1,1.3184,2.7042,0.05,3.2911,2.9244,1.8571,3.9081,2.9531,4.6036,10.9379,13.9498,2.1713,1.6763,8.2816,7.249,8.6962,7.7534,1.0321,3.9736,2.1031,0.836,9.1438,1.2363,5.2587,1.6559,3.1025,6.7935,7.2689,5.5068,1.8249,9.466,0.0278,5.2909,5.4614,0.1521,6.4767,1.6658,2.6688,3.3689,2.2354,5.7673,2.2314,5.0899,3.5667,0.6277,2.6893,4.9417,7.0917,8.6963,0.8636,2.2639,2.834,3.9808,4.0615,1.547,4.5443,0.8317,0.941,4.6379,0.6845,1.926,0.9564,1.1826,2.7943,0.0055,8.4199,2.3609,3.3133,1.1928,0.9681,2.2688,0.4599,0.1214,2.1204,1.1711,1.3674,1.3863,1.0743,4.965,3.8152,0.4871,1.5741,0.7371,0.2751,9.489,4.2098,1.2546,0.3678,8.2653,3.7618,1.0454,0.1454,5.2117,1.5405,4.8948,4.9213,4.8305,4.1109,1.3626,2.1982,3.0529,2.1055,4.2115,1.1294,0.0195,4.7881,0.8101,1.1381,0.0024,1.4502,0.8028,4.7404,1.2518,0.099,1.4768,0.4737,5.4315,3.6999,1.8236,6.1991,6.8914,2.9289,2.1417,4.1052,6.0367,2.5862,1.8767,3.0575,0.3608,2.0534,0.9454,0.4169,2.6419,2.2527,6.4855,5.5862,3.2547,0.8848,2.4004,3.0476,8.6919,1.6199,2.9308,6.4295,0.0811,8.2265,2.1699,2.0832,4.4894,0.0331,1.0372,4.2032,1.3245,0.3553,6.915,7.3207,6.6079,5.0144,9.0289,2.3648,0.6068,2.8475,2.3967,3.3804,0.4913,4.8407,15.7457,6.5331,6.832,4.1668,5.206,7.4876,3.6114,3.195,0.5159,5.0585,4.1412,6.4799,1.6166,0.03,1.3685,6.831,3.507,3.5073,1.4101,1.7895,7.2254,0.9454,4.2396,1.9965,4.1425,1.7212,7.2621,6.7418,7.7407,2.1387,2.6594,0.8066,0.4126,3.3084,4.8113,1.5587,1.5527,0.4917,5.6557,3.0491,7.6136,5.7171,0.0469,3.2651,5.4874,6.1319,0.2913,5.8151,3.1536,3.3812,4.2649,5.1844,0.7848,2.6269,1.1134,0.4492,0.5371,4.1877,3.6544,8.4833,0.1971,9.1695,0.5666,6.0905,1.6499,11.513,4.371,4.7567,4.176,6.8331,0.2091,2.2224,4.0553,3.4233,4.4503,1.6451,5.1455,5.2326,6.8162,5.528,1.453,0.003,8.4269,1.8387,8.1463,1.6136,8.1559,0.3287,6.7869,7.9185,10.8328,2.3704,4.1999,4.9284,1.7039,0.6039,0.6217,5.4494,1.3828,3.4481,2.8874,2.5328,4.4643,0.0073,1.3672,4.3228,5.279,11.6053,1.2634,7.2888,3.8359,5.034,2.0675,6.9963,3.3368,5.0788,3.7154,4.1763,0.5431,0.5401,0.4098,2.4471,2.1654,2.4204,4.1929,0.3758,3.7236,5.6681,5.1383,1.9789,1.5653,5.0839,5.8295,3.308,0.0596,2.2636,5.5299,3.4348,3.2043,2.8407,2.6163,2.6551,2.5721,1.5713,3.8769,3.1569,2.4761,3.9852,6.2922,0.1257,1.7056,2.8533,4.8218,2.9861,2.0656,0.0554,5.3756,0.8427,8.9494,1.3222,3.292,2.057,6.5021]}

{"prompt":"A kid tries to talk the monster under the bed into attacking the monster in the closet .","text":"A kid tries to talk the monster under the bed into attacking the monster in the closet. This one takes the form of a small creature. Like the other movies it shows you it\u2019s not scary to be scared. The main character faces his fears and is able to overcome his fears of the world, himself and his own fears. The monster in the closet is not a real monster\u2026it doesn\u2019t exist. There is no evil\u2026there\u2019s just an untapped power within you.\nI watched this one because it was based on a book that my high school English teacher had given me. The book was in my moments my favorite. The book was like a modern day version of H.P. Lovecrafts tales, but it was very different from Lovecraft\u2019s storyline. You get to see what it was like to live during the 1920\u2019s.\nI think most people will recognize the book from it\u2019s title! I read the book when I was a kid but it was decades later that I got to watch this movie. It was very much the kind of movie that stayed with me. The plot was good and I enjoyed seeing the different characters.\nIn the end\u2026I love horror movies, especially those with supernatural beings as the main attraction. I\u2019m not great at watching horror movies, but when I do\u2026I\u2019m usually not disappointed.\nThe film features two couples whose lives are changed when they find something unusual at their new home. After buying a new house, they find a small book with a note written on paper asking them to find out what it is that is behind a little panel.

There\u2019s nothing like creating new ideas and getting new friends. I thank you for the opportunity.\nYour poetry workshop has done great things in my life! It\u2019s not really easy to write poetry sometimes. However, it\u2019s really fun, easy and interesting. Thank you!\nI came without any idea or inspiration of the way of writing poetry and got so much information in one day! You are great at what you do!\nThis workshop was awesome! It was a lot of fun and I hope to attend another in the future! The teacher was very friendly and she made my day!\nI took my son to the poetry workshop and it was just amazing.

You\u2019re super awesome and fun and I hope I can have you teach again.\nThe experience was amazing! I\u2019ve been writing poetry for so long, but I\u2019ve never really written a poem in its entirety. I felt completely free to say all the things I wanted to say!\nIt was a lot of fun.

You always believed it is because you are sick, but one day you learn the truth. Then it is too late. The same is in life.\nThere are some things you can't ask for. Like money. When you are young there is no reason to ask for money. When you are old you just can't ask anymore. And what if it is not your money? Why can't you ask? Is it our duty to ask? Do we know that we are old yet? If we did, we wouldn't care. We will ask only if we really need it now.\nAnd then there are some things you should take for granted. Like health. You have the best health of anyone I have ever met in this world. I can still smell the perfume on your body and I know it's your favorite. And the taste of your clothes. I can't get bored of that. I know that there is something wrong with you. But it is all in our minds.\nI can't help thinking what might have been. I wish I didn't feel this way. But I can't. I'm sad.

I don't want ever, to think about your death, or any of your death.","token_len":358,"entropy":[6.9727,3.1023,12.1444,10.8479,2.5688,3.1311,13.4101,13.2168,7.4195,5.2403,3.1909,2.6828,14.2143,2.837,6.5468,5.209,1.1222,2.8991,3.7013,1.7272,1.345,6.472,0.6083,0.9755,5.4352,3.2662,0.4573,1.253,4.4669,2.9882,1.5757,4.5429,0.0377,0.845,2.7337,5.2881,2.3319,7.3224,4.5227,0.6045,2.8078,7.888,0.9977,3.4347,2.4809,1.6904,1.5615,1.9649,6.3806,0.4072,1.2561,5.27,4.3154,0.8268,4.2129,0.5802,2.1769,4.383,4.7903,0.8852,1.0657,3.796,0.9074,1.2761,0.3898,1.2469,0.4448,2.8995,0.1112,0.3809,0.9503,1.4813,5.0173,2.6629,0.0145,0.6809,6.6839,0.2006,3.7727,4.1456,3.2967,3.0356,0.957,2.5827,2.0784,2.62,1.0045,3.8764,2.8954,0.0501,0.2487,0.7053,2.8212,4.9207,0.7493,6.8579,6.0606,0.3779,2.1377,1.3457,4.0939,1.0449,4.0551,2.5534,1.6044,0.9834,5.8511,6.1026,0.5825,3.0935,0.8643,3.8377,1.4887,0.9292,2.6655,0.0015,5.1887,1.0964,1.6583,3.8445,2.751,4.5494,2.4673,0.6191,4.558,2.4127,0.6821,5.5276,0.4999,1.734,3.9376,2.4786,1.3024,0.846,3.5094,0.44,1.1461,3.5616,4.5473,3.1965,0.0253,0.3256,2.9937,4.6753,2.7375,2.406,2.859,3.7547,4.1446,1.6195,3.0561,2.5702,3.5301,0.883,0.1853,0.5662,3.2503,3.6533,1.33,0.1569,2.5137,3.1032,5.0413,4.5737,1.1548,4.3317,3.1639,0.942,3.726,2.4888,2.4799,2.1563,1.9901,2.2186,3.2228,4.2531,1.6444,2.7308,3.6715,5.5174,0.9676,1.1868,4.8152,1.1379,2.0151,1.7482,3.8831,4.1989,8.4319,0.9393,3.1124,0.585,1.7736,2.6855,2.2187,3.8956,0.8915,1.3658,3.9039,0.2357,1.4604,0.5783,2.421,2.7567,0.772,4.1086,3.6379,2.8001,4.6227,0.544,1.7293,2.4248,2.6615,1.3958,3.1901,2.975,4.4934,4.7715,1.8967,1.3414,1.3487,1.8495,4.7923,0.6002,4.692,0.0014,3.992,2.8575,0.1307,0.567,1.9999,1.0253,1.7171,0.6933,1.7748,0.9016,3.0384,6.2302,1.1471,5.3664,1.7534,5.4191,6.1774,2.7282,1.4276,1.3998,1.5144,3.5052,0.4735,2.1149,4.3447,2.7526,3.0989,1.7698,0.9656,1.3111,0.8876,5.3291,6.0815,0.8926,2.1539,3.0755,3.0546,3.6572,4.2001,5.0583,5.0174,2.3707,2.3914,4.4223,1.4066,1.6505,1.5381,6.1287,1.7893,1.1139,0.4517,1.6965,1.711,3.0507,0.0004,1.8566,0.4662,3.7551,0.2415,3.0985,5.503,2.2254,2.3251,0.0004,4.9638,6.0423,0.1981,3.1757,1.1745,3.7411,2.7494,2.5419,9.4582,6.2009,0.1284,4.1965,2.4175,3.0431,0.3745,5.0822,3.7218,3.5486,6.8274,3.8496,0.7784,3.8639,3.9065,1.4047,6.0984,0.1476,3.9899,7.8629,1.3045,0.8374,1.8521,5.1364,0.3761,0.3324,1.6988,2.862,0.0005,0.5255,0.3463,3.4972,2.5151,2.7927,7.8806,0.1657,2.8962,2.6755,1.3045,3.6637,2.705,0.9147,1.3179,0.0003,0.078,9.8631,6.3398,5.2362,4.6815,0.9857,2.4184,2.5351,2.1388,1.1121,4.2243,1.3171,1.4636,4.6684,0.9071]}

These Are The Questions :\nA : I have two brothers who live apart, only getting in touch when they\u2019re together at school. I think the only thing I like about them is their sense of responsibility to their father. A : I was raised in the country and have a good relationship with my animal friends.

A : It was the first time I got my period and I still don\u2019t know who I am. I would say that I have a healthy relationship with my friends. My favourite thing about school is that there is no homework, but there is not much going on, so there is not much to do. A : My best friend is someone I have been with all through my school life. There is so much going on that you can\u2019t really relax or get on with things, so I have a really low self-esteem. I think I am responsible and responsible. I think I like being in good company, but I don't like being part of a group.\nQ : I have a sister who lives far away in a different state. The only thing I like about her is her sense of humour. The only thing I like about school is that there is nothing to do in it. I think I am responsible and respect others, but I am still unconfident, especially with regards to dressing and dating.","token_len":359,"entropy":[3.6368,7.196,0.8156,9.0004,0.8713,0.1514,5.2015,2.0499,4.435,1.2238,6.5354,17.6622,2.5016,0.9976,6.919,1.8243,3.2292,4.1857,7.3679,2.7135,1.5636,7.3812,1.6373,2.0641,1.3855,0.0015,0.0636,0.9333,2.328,9.5846,0.0886,0.1312,0.3485,2.6821,3.3358,0.9152,4.7623,0.1696,4.0012,2.7937,0.8219,2.2801,0.9291,5.3431,3.7477,4.2788,2.1597,1.3371,0.6138,4.6283,0.9199,5.3494,1.227,3.2453,4.5743,10.2304,1.308,4.3216,6.9144,2.6426,2.3997,5.4101,1.4059,4.8299,4.5954,3.534,2.9557,6.5584,4.6491,1.8535,3.1438,6.0122,2.3567,5.4735,6.6813,5.5101,0.6181,2.7267,0.7966,17.994,7.9052,2.1959,3.0788,5.4805,3.8061,0.6545,2.4837,3.4708,3.1163,3.1224,1.8524,1.8185,4.8815,0.5974,0.6102,0.2471,1.3507,5.0097,0.0166,4.4235,2.5406,1.3893,3.9209,1.1896,2.8431,0.5915,1.3208,4.0246,2.2848,1.5503,2.3065,5.3313,2.1372,2.4885,2.2918,3.1018,1.9298,0.0623,0.6825,11.3408,1.393,0.695,1.122,2.038,2.5383,2.4379,4.5405,4.1904,6.1256,3.0488,2.5338,0.888,0.9663,2.2999,3.5574,7.5383,5.3197,0.1157,3.624,4.0854,4.2718,1.4298,6.8485,3.861,3.5082,5.0106,0.2336,0.2566,0.8546,0.1378,3.6551,2.3778,3.4596,1.7405,0.2603,0.4145,4.1855,3.8045,7.9184,2.1283,1.4349,4.6362,2.2215,3.2578,0.4429,0.1417,1.5332,3.9954,1.4888,0.4426,0.9448,1.281,3.6313,3.426,1.6477,1.1242,2.3357,1.6261,5.3699,1.7408,0.0968,0.3755,3.7403,1.9499,4.6632,6.6146,2.1043,0.6441,6.11,0.3041,1.8536,3.231,0.6995,1.595,4.7729,1.7182,2.888,2.8154,0.6586,5.4196,0.6927,4.1922,0.03,3.2034,0.976,2.8098,0.4393,2.6052,0.3276,1.8519,0.863,0.5366,0.6359,0.0373,2.5556,4.4738,0.3761,1.2175,7.0204,1.2048,2.335,2.8176,1.8632,3.3767,8.3606,0.8876,4.071,1.5365,0.6211,4.8649,0.7086,3.6874,0.0631,1.7576,0.0112,2.2635,3.5719,1.8047,8.3078,0.1481,0.0637,2.9041,6.6227,2.849,3.385,3.802,0.3761,3.1804,2.5282,1.3175,0.82,2.8294,1.982,3.7045,4.3353,1.3583,0.3409,0.0583,0.4249,1.9902,1.4919,1.3856,1.4601,2.4225,0.9476,3.7222,2.8738,2.4295,1.2716,0.9479,4.1455,2.6105,2.6439,5.3931,0.8321,1.3436,0.9178,0.592,1.6804,1.4054,1.1029,0.9449,4.8154,0.0027,1.1776,0.9431,1.0838,3.7134,3.9606,0.5867,1.6459,1.9629,1.1016,3.7329,0.4414,2.0338,5.8673,0.2769,3.393,2.2191,2.0877,3.2514,1.515,3.9468,1.9557,0.6311,0.5639,0.5233,0.0562,0.0948,0.0692,1.164,1.3317,0.0163,6.335,0.7054,4.3104,0.9864,0.2729,0.2367,0.5434,0.0354,7.3155,0.0546,0.4835,0.2546,0.0655,4.0478,1.4528,0.4849,3.8515,3.8716,0.5341,2.1446,0.6266,0.8646,0.5572,0.1161,0.1439,6.3201,0.1056,0.2946,0.0177,0.0986,0.1527,0.0107,0.0396,0.0002,0.0004,0.2466,0.0102,5.4603,5.537,0.0083,8.8505,2.409,6.1669,0.5173]}

Do n't look it up - just try to BS your way through it .","text":"Write about a topic you know virtually *nothing* about, and try to appear knowledgeable. Don't look it up - just try to BS your way through it. And when it sounds like you have nailed it, get an expert on to do the real work, the hard work.\nI also agree with the other two posts that the only type of writing that a writer can get good at is writing in your area of interest.\nWriting about a topic that matters to you, like what you like to read, can be so exciting and exciting; no wonder you say it is so inspiring. I really enjoy writing and trying to incorporate some real life experiences and events. As I am in the process of researching and writing my novel, I have the opportunity to delve into various topics, however, for example, I have never written fiction except in a very short form and this time with more serious and longer pieces of writing, I realize the difference.\nMy goal is to write, not just write my words and words onto the paper or screen, but to write something that not only has a place but lives, and that the end result can be useful as well.\nIf you do research, and write about what you know about, you can make yourself more educated because you are learning new things. What\u2019s more, if you write, you will find your words are more accurate and easier to find. It\u2019s very much like learning a foreign language that you want to speak fluently, don\u2019t you?\nHmm I do think a writer needs to be interested in the world and people around them. However if she is not able to write then I would rather not write.

{"prompt":"Weapons become more powerful the older they get . Modern guns will barely give someone a scratch but an ancient spear can devastate armies .","text":"Weapons become more powerful the older they get. Modern guns will barely give someone a scratch but an ancient spear can devastate armies. The sword can easily cut through shields. It is very good for defense. You may see weapons that are not on the list but are more than appropriate as well.\nWeapons such as arrows of magical or enchanted origin do not fit into the class. This includes crossbows, crossbows, enchanted weapons, and weapons of magic, enchantment, or legendary origin (fire arrows, magic axes, magic daggers, magical darts, and mystic swords). See weapon magic.\nCrown armor is a unique type of armor with its own features that makes it very special in comparison with leather, metal, and other types of armor. The main thing about wearing crown armor is that it provides complete protection against all types of stabs. An experienced defender can easily use it on one side, while the attacker uses a standard weapon to move all the way to the other side. Of course, the main purpose of wearing Crown armor is not to be killed but to be able to take away the other man's life for many hours even without the use of weapons. A few hits and it's gone.\nWeapons of magical and legendary origin. An arrow of Magical or supernatural origin has a higher chance to hit. The power of the arrow is measured in points, and the more powerful the arrow, the more points it has. An arrow can also have a chance of causing other effects, such as poison or paralysis, depending on the origin of the arrow.\nArrow tip strength indicates the strength of the arrow tip. When strength is equal or greater than three times the strength of the arrow, the target will be weakened temporarily, and the damage caused will be at a higher level.","token_len":361,"entropy":[8.8201,2.3374,2.485,4.444,5.4281,1.6212,1.3008,0.5926,9.0464,5.2778,4.2948,7.2462,5.1521,7.3252,1.6135,4.5357,5.331,5.0934,5.6212,6.8916,2.2757,7.0026,0.0004,5.3186,1.4139,2.6627,5.5481,2.4518,5.0216,3.2773,0.5471,4.1529,2.1197,3.8709,1.931,3.9631,5.0206,2.0998,4.555,1.6387,4.3138,3.5727,4.6581,5.9466,1.9136,1.4824,3.3971,4.9033,1.1587,2.3348,1.7802,2.4529,3.873,3.5633,6.6106,4.1283,2.6075,0.3178,1.4195,8.1079,5.3644,0.0018,4.2584,6.5167,6.5835,3.7121,7.2878,4.3808,4.5994,0.3969,5.8164,1.4552,0.9483,5.6397,1.5343,3.9176,3.8982,6.2725,0.0552,0.8914,2.2937,0.0231,2.4847,7.0456,2.4421,0.4898,1.4167,4.1581,1.7024,2.7451,3.0221,5.1363,0.2077,1.5452,6.1987,0.7266,3.4818,5.4818,3.8266,0.6836,3.4796,4.1966,0.1024,2.266,2.6004,0.0004,0.318,3.2462,5.3683,0.4428,1.5454,8.2066,2.6036,0.2529,6.2088,5.5416,7.4455,1.6177,0.3675,5.1216,5.3778,6.7932,1.2893,1.807,3.998,2.6511,0.0871,0.8703,3.575,4.0905,1.5225,6.4661,2.7163,4.2399,0.5057,2.7926,3.8173,3.048,4.4967,2.3441,8.2542,2.7367,4.4105,0.1689,0.8636,2.5199,2.7125,0.1458,0.207,0.1529,2.3997,4.8163,4.0715,3.0373,6.2572,1.2638,0.1549,0.1446,0.4546,0.5312,3.5695,7.5046,0.1002,1.6016,1.8691,1.8128,0.0114,7.8727,1.5379,1.524,5.5242,4.8135,5.7001,2.077,2.5881,3.7743,3.0094,2.8562,4.4217,2.4902,2.787,2.1031,2.6541,4.2037,5.1579,3.8061,4.6164,3.1929,2.525,6.0955,5.7375,1.0401,0.2003,1.4986,0.3539,1.0129,0.2319,0.4699,6.5743,0.0835,0.402,2.2209,5.1448,3.8376,0.145,4.0464,4.0906,0.3581,0.1222,2.7008,0.4988,3.3212,5.4929,1.4319,0.3203,3.3572,2.5993,0.0073,3.5392,5.254,1.6522,4.9553,4.9933,0.2353,1.8908,4.5889,6.2117,2.3991,6.7934,2.9318,2.5611,2.7439,0.0035,2.7815,0.269,4.1703,4.505,7.2452,3.3073,5.4873,2.3498,5.8703,0.4796,1.0481,3.5809,2.1882,2.9882,4.3676,2.3196,0.122,5.6173,5.0812,4.6668,0.9269,8.716,2.0551,7.4803,0.0364,4.0311,1.4094,4.3291,0.6959,1.384,2.1572,2.5467,2.3657,6.3256,0.5794,1.3443,0.6613,0.9499,7.0546,0.4368,3.4188,2.0184,2.3394,1.691,3.7649,6.1888,0.3768,0.407,0.7912,0.0149,1.0292,1.4141,0.8581,1.475,0.4559,3.8844,0.618,2.918,2.6495,4.0255,0.9104,2.6248,0.9639,3.9672,5.6205,3.8087,1.6838,0.3636,0.0042,2.904,1.8039,3.5537,1.4042,4.366,0.0488,0.5381,3.2886,0.9497,0.0906,0.3188,0.2615,1.2752,5.7506,1.3499,8.5557,6.8211,7.7494,0.8892,2.145,0.116,0.2024,0.5581,3.5359,0.4332,4.3323,8.8379,0.3847,3.1654,4.4565,0.6674,1.1784,5.8294,3.4513,0.7148,3.1017,0.0628,0.3136,1.7405,0.6119,0.7203,5.7261,1.8992,1.2331,5.4709,6.195,2.428,1.4651,1.1377,3.2922,4.7868,1.1637,0.7819,6.8063,2.1605,1.8968,1.5538,0.5127]}

So what is this movie, I have been hearing all about this movie for so long and I wanted to know how people could get sucked in to it, is this a true movie that happened to them or are they just getting paid? I mean I know many are going to be paid for this movie, but why should you spend money to see something that is either true or false.\nI know that there has been so much talk about this movie and I am so sad that so many people are dying to see this movie, I think there are many people that read this blog and that are actually scared to go see the movie because they know that the truth does not matter to them, to them what matters is who will have the most followers and fans. This movie I am not saying to say that it is a lie or it is not true, I am saying that all the people that are talking about this movie, are people that are following the wrong people that are talking about this movie and that just want to get followers and make some money. I am going to tell you that this movie has actually happened to someone and that is my family. There are so many people on this Earth all of them having one thing in common which is they are all following this movie and all of them dying from this movie, how can anyone trust the person that says something when that person actually kills your loved one. This movie is a hoax, people want to make money, they want to make a name for themselves and they don\u2019t care that these people are not real they just want to have the fake fan base and money making opportunities.","token_len":361,"entropy":[5.6387,0.7385,3.9647,7.8503,5.7461,1.1405,2.9142,4.8792,3.2607,5.7698,4.1724,7.674,1.3852,9.3736,1.8033,2.3735,1.0895,2.5943,5.7648,1.602,13.667,4.265,3.1712,4.9359,4.5265,7.7674,3.7277,1.8204,7.9655,0.4441,1.095,4.3133,2.9085,2.2277,2.7554,6.6953,4.1086,4.6839,3.2699,3.2647,5.613,2.9908,3.4012,3.353,1.5292,0.9291,3.0475,0.1431,2.3883,1.111,4.333,0.0516,3.1273,2.6994,4.5101,3.1623,2.1533,6.5823,2.0342,2.0128,1.5302,2.8809,5.1612,1.7878,2.289,3.734,3.0836,3.0222,6.1916,1.7822,2.6208,3.0314,3.3283,0.6273,1.0771,4.5543,5.0615,3.6198,2.3534,3.0928,2.5637,2.6763,4.5611,3.98,3.0264,0.1491,2.0445,4.1456,2.1536,0.8501,0.8944,1.3844,0.8474,3.6159,3.7755,2.2877,5.3822,1.4754,1.5783,3.2404,3.476,1.0457,2.0987,7.9271,4.1248,0.2095,3.2895,2.5936,1.6899,6.8625,2.6604,2.7915,3.0329,4.1172,0.1692,3.6645,0.7121,2.5722,0.4629,1.3812,0.4355,2.2587,2.3229,2.2931,2.9188,3.6105,1.7053,2.9244,0.0904,0.4132,1.2499,2.7632,2.7483,0.4383,1.1663,0.3249,1.5342,1.9336,3.0879,3.0724,1.4523,2.3533,1.588,1.9155,7.4548,0.9711,2.5668,1.2555,3.8028,2.2069,4.3043,4.3944,1.618,1.849,0.8847,2.9652,0.194,1.3939,1.1524,2.5336,1.3843,2.5765,2.7368,5.8259,0.2096,2.1341,1.9627,0.2136,1.7922,5.7831,1.5568,4.4562,2.751,0.3176,3.8784,4.1219,4.3055,1.2145,2.4279,7.3946,1.4474,5.7626,1.4922,3.4433,0.7762,5.4523,1.9319,2.9546,2.2624,3.3469,4.2204,0.8784,2.2643,0.4701,1.9923,2.8723,1.8997,3.4883,0.3636,1.9798,1.4313,0.6405,1.3351,0.7877,0.4093,0.3568,4.8243,2.322,0.826,1.2074,1.7987,5.399,0.103,0.4069,0.4929,3.0235,2.1946,3.3724,0.6379,1.1893,6.6347,1.5602,5.2698,2.2558,3.9031,0.905,4.9153,0.0954,1.0808,0.2321,1.7821,2.0981,5.6308,3.1404,0.2411,2.4292,10.1002,0.9268,5.1372,4.8564,0.1707,0.9877,1.6649,1.338,3.5739,0.0315,1.9482,0.2639,1.9825,1.9023,0.3219,3.035,4.8384,3.0934,0.3589,5.3458,1.7918,1.3759,2.1443,4.3095,3.4378,1.1807,4.7454,0.9053,2.3074,0.0084,0.5187,4.0062,0.7975,4.7779,6.846,2.2677,1.0873,5.1133,5.3929,1.555,0.1851,0.0163,4.8161,0.0845,1.5219,1.1533,0.895,5.1523,2.5783,0.4798,1.2043,3.1763,0.5066,0.2961,6.1956,4.9257,3.0693,2.2573,1.8017,4.7874,1.085,3.2111,6.0308,2.956,3.9674,0.9038,3.7724,3.1784,6.1387,3.7021,0.3505,4.5634,5.4983,6.4766,2.314,0.9477,2.3315,3.0426,0.4448,1.0935,2.3399,4.5618,1.6124,4.252,4.6776,0.3275,3.1831,0.2346,2.2127,1.636,0.8783,0.2685,1.7997,2.5601,3.5433,0.0681,0.0175,1.2125,1.4849,3.3476,15.287,8.0238,1.222,1.4451,2.9373,4.3741,0.2752,0.9833,2.5012,1.8663,4.4408,0.8394,0.5074,0.2384,3.6594,2.5326,6.8526,6.9986,1.8001,2.0658,4.381,6.4709,4.583,1.5494]}

This is the ultimate achievement and life changing moment for you... You get to choose your stats and perks for the next life and you know if you are going to be a powerful dragon or a wise wizard or if you are going to be a poor worker like me.\nI got to be an alchemist and the last guy who I went for was an astronomer and I made myself as a powerful astronomer with high points in astronomy. I have decided that I am going to be an astronomer for the next ten thousand years.

For example, good hearted people smell good like vanilla, and a bad person would smell something like a public bathroom. One day, you meet someone who doesn't smell like anything.

Read the beginning and end of this story. The main characters is an old man named, Mr. Smell. The story started when the old man met a strange boy, and asked him to help him to find his son. The boy told the old man, that he could tell when someone was lying, and when someone was telling the truth. The old man had to decide which boy was telling a truth. The story ends because the boy finally decides to give the old man, a box that he found. What did you make of this story? Did you find any solution to the problem in it? Can you give an example of how the boy found out, whether the old man was lying or telling the truth? There were only two characters in the book, but there are several reasons why this story is told. You might want to discuss with your friends. If you decide to use another piece of information from the book other than the characters, you will have to discuss the problem more.

Unfortunately, someone is outside the room \u2013 a prying neighbour, in fact, who couldn\u2019t help but overhear what is going on.\nThe writer should have some kind of a story-telling method. She \/ he should be able to use humour, irony ( a specialty ), sarcasm, satire, or even make some kind of a joke. For example, the writer could make fun of the way the prying neighbour is describing what happened.\nThe story should end with the readers asking themselves, what would have happened in that situation \u2013 would the neighbours have been allowed to enter the apartment and would someone get hurt? The writer must create the reader\u2019s curiosity.\nA side story can become a short story of a fictional character. It could be done in the following way : we start with a side story of a famous fictional character, who has something remarkable to disclose, but then the writer makes us wonder about the identity of that person until the end.\nThe writer must avoid talking too much about the story. The story can have any characters, but there must be only one main character.","token_len":363,"entropy":[4.0641,8.9086,4.8896,3.1161,3.2598,6.7628,8.0052,1.0576,2.0565,4.3049,5.2882,7.112,1.9975,2.824,2.6961,4.6156,4.7196,1.9313,1.5839,0.7657,3.5771,3.3251,5.0884,0.8717,5.9735,1.9802,5.2491,3.774,4.0042,8.005,5.4904,1.8021,3.457,3.3684,2.8378,13.5986,8.373,1.3824,2.8276,3.6315,2.1126,0.5726,0.7894,2.1861,2.3124,5.5939,0.2103,3.3797,3.5809,4.8148,7.0049,2.3322,1.8688,15.5054,5.4705,5.3058,0.2179,3.1695,7.8816,1.4874,1.7265,2.4437,5.0101,3.2725,4.303,1.7293,4.0868,2.316,5.0172,0.3596,7.6192,2.6709,2.8519,5.1808,3.4186,4.1515,0.1961,0.632,2.002,1.6046,4.6469,2.4992,0.0222,2.0966,0.7609,0.476,5.785,2.6266,4.3814,5.9408,0.4107,0.2234,2.0901,2.2063,5.3892,0.7087,7.5752,4.0007,2.0991,4.6362,1.2577,6.1734,1.272,1.5442,4.5273,4.3756,2.3725,6.3564,0.7833,0.721,4.8746,3.6865,8.2616,4.7531,6.2341,2.0118,7.337,1.9267,4.0613,2.2857,6.422,6.8193,9.8218,1.3389,6.3371,2.6304,2.7683,7.1011,6.8179,0.6461,2.5297,1.6896,0.156,3.0967,6.2515,1.0357,5.5522,0.274,6.6847,2.3042,6.7911,1.609,2.3413,4.4327,3.1219,7.7291,4.2136,9.3895,2.33,4.7328,3.6605,1.8295,2.21,7.4454,6.5915,4.4204,0.0387,2.5523,0.4878,7.6724,0.0091,3.512,2.5273,1.1053,0.017,0.5053,1.3932,1.5961,9.5987,6.0917,2.5709,4.5434,3.8814,0.0442,4.1623,3.2748,4.1765,1.5096,4.5965,2.1603,4.9747,10.5339,3.4041,0.6652,2.7469,0.817,0.0059,4.1827,6.6841,1.7567,4.2394,5.6399,8.2789,9.2725,3.6893,3.8261,0.0005,1.0583,4.7379,0.7656,2.7639,1.6782,6.8603,3.0267,2.2673,0.0052,3.5733,1.6695,0.9122,4.6848,0.7031,0.3298,2.4543,2.5383,1.1836,3.3914,2.4202,0.0378,1.236,5.2854,1.2346,2.83,0.1974,0.4236,1.5921,6.6901,3.848,1.94,1.7945,1.3204,1.4753,3.12,0.9928,4.3421,0.3829,1.3266,6.8827,3.606,3.2229,2.148,2.1492,3.1387,2.8215,0.1395,3.7181,3.1977,1.9541,4.8032,3.2589,1.3078,4.7818,0.3342,1.5696,5.5315,0.1847,3.7215,0.7359,5.6849,2.351,6.0948,5.1361,6.7443,2.0976,0.9571,2.8238,2.3399,4.9304,5.2264,3.1577,6.4709,6.0717,0.4518,2.715,6.0587,2.1476,0.877,3.9142,4.9324,0.4224,3.1113,6.3063,0.9643,5.1147,0.8547,4.4055,1.1453,2.117,0.0596,1.5698,2.33,1.2595,0.6844,7.1999,1.1759,2.5576,2.2199,0.5697,0.7384,8.9907,3.9152,0.6615,0.7161,5.3015,0.292,1.468,0.4591,1.0436,0.1298,0.0054,0.7525,4.4966,1.0968,8.5133,6.0688,0.9445,8.3003,2.1917,1.6678,3.5018,3.3732,3.3121,4.2422,5.106,2.4831,1.3227,2.0811,3.6165,0.2452,1.9763,2.0075,5.6508,0.2959,0.0746,0.3036,1.1558,1.2668,2.2671,2.282,5.6856,5.5224,2.0827,0.1388,0.5127,0.776,2.9421,1.8031,1.9115,1.7965,2.7576,3.4804,3.6568,6.0068,1.7188,1.6749,3.628,1.6384,0.1491,4.8549,0.204,3.1464,0.162,0.7657]}

The first wines were poured by glass and the second by bottle so that you got a better sample of the wine, while also showing you the differences in the bottles.","token_len":364,"entropy":[7.2799,7.7696,5.7551,8.4121,1.4627,7.1123,2.0922,3.9306,6.9225,3.7291,3.4776,0.4499,1.6786,0.0767,4.0391,3.8771,3.6415,0.9967,2.2433,0.5351,8.3174,4.8937,0.592,1.6016,3.8533,3.908,0.34,1.244,4.3003,5.9538,1.8269,3.6252,3.6732,5.7171,1.454,3.7217,3.9713,9.4331,7.3159,0.3619,1.4936,4.1658,0.8635,4.5748,4.0536,6.6473,4.1952,3.3021,5.8491,4.9015,2.6664,3.0715,3.8086,0.6617,4.2345,4.6419,3.1822,3.4048,6.5047,0.2553,2.0693,2.8044,1.4664,2.7344,7.1283,2.6719,5.6034,1.932,4.2214,0.175,2.2936,8.3201,1.7043,4.7391,0.6071,5.2884,0.5385,0.5522,5.4877,1.3129,3.3572,4.9921,3.7406,0.5827,4.1013,1.7804,3.4714,7.4732,2.9377,4.3238,8.4421,5.5489,0.0428,2.0188,2.1011,3.8226,6.9948,1.5263,3.294,0.728,0.5062,1.1674,2.9251,0.0886,3.3892,0.0081,1.1453,0.6599,4.0903,0.7288,2.5856,1.5064,2.6464,2.4167,2.4412,1.7726,2.833,2.1536,3.7101,2.219,4.8153,4.4866,0.2992,3.4147,5.3492,2.6221,6.3965,1.9673,1.28,1.6634,3.247,2.3685,0.6986,4.5822,7.2885,3.1289,0.8598,5.1439,1.8094,4.348,6.6394,2.6597,1.8273,10.4105,3.38,1.1285,1.2082,4.0031,0.0019,2.994,1.455,3.3812,5.9611,3.0362,1.5454,6.6057,1.5096,6.1206,4.377,2.2056,1.1831,5.687,0.4938,1.7684,4.5878,1.1612,2.8342,1.8327,1.7364,0.6304,4.5315,1.69,1.1055,1.3969,3.0044,2.5419,0.8501,3.041,0.5808,1.1953,11.4247,1.4494,0.1951,5.2531,1.5528,4.4112,2.6141,5.0016,6.4367,1.1053,0.5149,4.9366,2.2291,0.9075,2.0516,3.3479,3.0295,7.3632,3.4648,2.807,1.5849,0.6207,6.4291,4.6779,0.1835,4.4298,16.5036,7.4757,1.2988,2.6288,7.294,1.1077,0.7398,1.7592,1.5201,0.4212,0.0861,0.8921,2.3853,4.9185,3.6366,3.2457,6.8169,2.592,0.6357,5.9045,2.0874,3.1669,2.599,3.3234,1.3995,1.4125,4.4516,1.0664,4.8557,5.3273,2.9702,2.9098,3.7459,1.5192,1.5357,2.8744,0.4397,3.776,1.0096,0.8276,3.3587,1.6798,0.2121,2.7391,4.0255,0.0928,1.2321,1.9511,2.7254,4.1788,3.5497,2.5769,5.3184,1.0714,3.7204,0.1404,0.1061,0.0018,1.6469,5.1232,4.733,4.9576,1.5239,9.0493,2.7788,6.1509,3.345,1.5309,2.2221,1.7632,6.509,0.5561,0.9082,0.8129,3.4651,1.1362,2.462,3.9324,2.8299,5.6105,0.8189,0.3478,1.5763,6.7127,5.9149,5.6465,5.154,0.4864,2.0858,4.3917,3.4554,4.1308,5.4059,0.5178,6.5571,3.6342,7.3752,0.9011,0.7213,2.0461,14.2427,5.283,8.3013,3.1373,14.1996,1.8435,7.4882,1.5818,0.8216,2.305,3.1016,0.4172,3.2344,1.3075,3.6692,8.2378,1.2267,3.7199,0.1631,8.164,2.6426,0.3407,1.2042,0.8537,2.6644,2.2445,5.3848,1.2012,7.5698,1.4436,8.9334,1.8977,2.4532,1.084,1.5687,2.6091,4.7907,0.946,1.6748,5.8078,1.3821,3.3168,8.1407,0.8059,1.0131,2.4272,3.7695,4.4842,2.0033,3.386,1.5357,1.3729,4.181,1.6061,1.3758,6.1158,0.9447]}

You must help them avoid the darkness and lead them to the light.\nOnce you have watched your way through the apocalypse, leave a comment or tweet us. We would like to hear all about what you saw. We will also take photos, but if you do not want them posted, please let us know in advance. We will post a few select pictures that you have agreed to allow us to. Your story and your thoughts are very important to us.\nPlease share the link with your friends and family. They can watch as long as everyone takes responsibility for themselves and for others.

{"prompt":"Memories ( of the deceased ? ) are sold on the black market .","text":"Memories ( of the deceased? ) are sold on the black market.I would love to know what the true price is. There are people buying all these pictures to make these people very happy?\nThe whole question of ghosts seems to be a good point to bring into discussion. Does this mean that ghosts or souls in a grave have nothing to do with us, or has the fact of a dead person being in a grave somehow connected with us? I have been reading a lot about the spirits of the deceased and the way they guide us and our lives. I am wondering if there is a difference between this and the souls of the people who have passed away who are still present in a grave? I am curious if the ghosts that you have heard about are spirits, or souls?\nMy parents have very big graves in my name. This is in a cemetery in the south of France. When i got a little older my parents had me sign many things that their ashes were in my name. At the same time they wanted me to sign their pictures in my name. I am in France now, but i miss my family. I used to come to my village, to see my relatives, but now I don't go so often, because I live in the south now. I have a picture of them both in my name. I am very curious why they want me to have this picture. Is it that they want me to have a present from them, or do they have a special meaning to me? If they were alive today, would they want me to have their pictures in my name? Did the people that lived with them before they died have pictures of them at home or would they have made them? Was it their tradition to leave pictures of their family in case of a death in the family?","token_len":365,"entropy":[8.6248,4.8015,8.2929,2.2853,5.6917,7.2396,1.5818,4.916,8.0333,2.7977,1.2689,2.7196,0.0311,1.3043,8.1326,3.8385,3.0919,0.1947,2.1651,1.6688,2.4505,4.9612,4.0452,1.5176,1.705,5.4376,0.9084,4.6382,4.9942,4.5924,2.5987,3.5928,4.3312,2.6313,5.7793,4.2587,6.7223,0.9187,6.8462,3.3962,7.9072,5.8111,6.7329,1.8103,7.331,4.16,1.0077,0.8038,1.8285,4.1828,5.0988,1.957,4.8138,3.9271,3.2998,0.7435,5.6034,2.3122,1.5023,0.4708,2.5467,5.7387,6.5169,4.5118,3.2828,5.5347,3.3484,4.5045,0.1044,0.224,0.0136,4.2276,1.9323,0.6112,4.806,2.23,3.5163,2.9763,3.3618,2.8418,0.3008,1.7993,3.1215,1.4797,0.3965,4.0771,4.638,1.3887,1.256,1.3079,2.4728,2.7736,2.7635,3.8124,2.1264,0.3636,1.0623,1.595,6.1141,0.7894,2.0489,2.2499,1.3877,2.7227,4.3416,0.7044,8.9105,1.283,2.3758,4.1978,1.1062,0.644,1.6934,2.4868,3.7951,0.5438,1.6119,0.589,1.3656,4.095,0.6809,4.6116,0.7476,1.2936,5.4658,0.7867,1.0276,4.9442,0.6073,2.8261,3.3805,0.5883,5.7307,1.7043,1.91,5.1159,1.254,2.3597,0.6861,2.7559,2.1988,2.0101,2.2176,1.8272,2.0503,2.2768,3.6543,4.0914,1.9844,4.2432,1.4894,1.2205,4.4932,3.4886,0.8067,4.1319,3.0282,1.7839,4.087,5.4501,3.3861,5.8272,5.5072,3.0376,2.2102,4.428,4.4236,0.8194,4.7534,0.8693,4.7207,2.5244,2.0338,1.1493,2.443,4.5234,0.5149,1.6714,0.7801,3.7624,6.5251,3.9299,3.9587,3.1218,1.0556,2.7496,1.385,3.1971,6.7719,7.2605,6.5812,3.1612,2.939,6.6506,6.6734,1.4173,2.6386,3.1458,1.548,0.4107,5.1317,1.1974,2.6475,0.0116,1.8402,3.6391,0.7535,0.0425,1.9914,4.6112,5.8503,2.9435,1.1672,0.3336,0.6377,1.3874,3.3261,4.4238,3.0073,1.8532,1.8461,1.6652,2.1102,5.6496,1.3253,2.6435,1.3488,1.3782,5.5361,0.006,4.1037,1.1422,1.8055,5.7325,3.0443,3.2244,2.4262,1.3135,3.0519,1.2151,1.9754,1.3331,1.5043,2.3269,0.0022,2.4162,4.783,1.4992,3.0443,2.0998,1.5462,4.5092,0.591,1.7746,3.1825,7.296,0.3583,1.1828,2.2201,2.2513,3.894,0.7327,3.3984,6.3505,1.7001,0.2975,1.715,1.1364,1.3923,1.9221,1.9135,3.333,4.3708,1.2116,2.557,1.2384,0.0516,3.5135,2.036,0.1935,1.2302,3.2427,0.7883,3.2407,0.8623,1.4737,1.1959,0.0273,1.6949,1.7967,8.9749,3.3097,1.2414,1.6954,0.5188,2.8235,0.1469,2.7857,1.5893,3.5954,4.2605,1.2347,0.8451,0.8634,3.7387,1.4968,3.5909,6.0899,4.0081,0.8249,1.9047,0.4351,2.7038,1.152,0.0965,0.8603,4.1545,2.2132,1.1133,0.3024,0.1674,0.4807,5.5738,2.7639,2.2971,2.7971,4.0354,3.4958,1.071,5.7791,1.1773,0.4709,1.9956,5.437,1.334,0.5265,4.7806,4.2989,2.3943,4.216,0.2285,1.297,6.4117,1.4338,3.75,5.709,1.3237,3.6589,6.2165,0.7415,4.4585,1.5025,0.9254,1.0895,4.323,1.491,7.1757,1.2853,2.2098,2.7237,3.5642,1.1656,1.9559,0.9679]}

Canadians , being Canadian , are too polite to correct them .","text":"Deeply misunderstanding the term `` universal healthcare '', aliens have begun arriving in Canada, seeking medical attention. Canadians, being Canadian, are too polite to correct them. One man recently told me that he thought the only true Canadian thing was the `` red rose \u00bb. ''\nI don't like the term, but it seems the English-speaking world is now discussing whether Canada has a health care or an educational system. I really wish I could be in there as an American health care expert, explaining why the current system is the most adequate. Canada does have a public health care system, which is administered by the provinces and operated by the individual municipalities using a tax system as a means of financing. The municipalities then pay for, and manage their own hospitals and other health care facilities. The provinces, having to respond to a variety of differing needs, are more like the states of our American system.\nThe fact is, Canada has more hospitals per capita than any other country, including the United States -- perhaps due to our cold and, at times, dangerous climate. We also have a strong hospital-based medical specialty system, both because we do have hospitals, and because of our geographic situation, especially in the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, where you travel for long distances.\nThe Canadian hospitals are very good institutions, but only the hospitals and not the doctors and pharmacists have the means and ability to solve local problems. What the Canadian system does do is to coordinate and co-ordinate. The provinces have the power to set policies and guidelines for health care, but the actual implementation in each province is handled by the municipalities, some of which will have to comply with provincial guidelines, some of which will be at or above provincial standards, and some of which will work with the provincial guidelines to serve their own communities.","token_len":366,"entropy":[6.6406,12.6425,1.3676,6.1857,8.2504,15.2944,5.5132,3.0365,1.7452,11.4768,2.2928,6.3764,5.1883,1.1884,4.4684,2.1722,4.5633,2.843,3.1769,2.0479,5.7102,3.5427,5.4091,5.4665,0.425,1.4002,6.3358,4.9033,0.6298,8.0876,2.8956,0.7958,5.061,4.7919,4.6653,2.1592,0.6672,0.896,1.1766,4.5533,2.2489,4.5185,7.5131,3.0047,4.887,1.6787,3.1032,9.1685,9.2124,6.8205,7.8499,2.9069,4.5773,2.3849,6.1964,3.5264,0.0034,3.9726,2.1086,1.1521,1.7,0.8929,1.9508,3.4264,4.0897,6.0035,3.7654,0.211,1.5579,1.2565,4.353,7.1722,5.095,3.6928,2.7829,1.5713,3.4321,0.6184,7.427,3.2288,5.7173,0.3203,0.696,2.4481,5.7879,3.2899,2.1867,0.6591,3.4258,3.4486,5.2234,4.4811,2.241,2.2312,7.4845,0.2959,3.6352,1.1933,7.8532,2.5492,2.611,4.7531,1.5324,1.0764,4.0836,3.4815,7.6213,1.9688,5.4981,3.6943,0.7172,0.9877,3.8618,0.6575,2.8569,0.0464,0.687,2.9802,0.9116,7.2553,0.3628,1.0515,3.3705,1.3797,8.3381,0.2078,0.6591,6.5664,4.5926,7.6202,1.9773,5.7971,1.1008,5.5063,2.0288,1.8332,0.4215,3.6613,2.8325,1.9811,7.8019,4.471,2.0922,1.5504,5.446,2.0076,4.6721,4.3546,0.831,4.319,1.1863,2.8485,1.4244,0.3046,1.7307,0.6646,1.8108,3.4972,3.0164,4.3539,3.7371,7.5536,0.1774,2.5902,4.7097,0.0015,8.0174,1.5622,0.51,2.5626,4.9076,4.7305,2.4419,2.9505,1.8683,6.1102,6.0772,3.0809,0.9497,1.8265,1.9848,4.3927,1.3795,0.8708,2.3223,1.1817,4.3856,4.1487,3.1585,0.0376,0.1084,0.7855,0.2599,0.7185,2.323,3.6735,1.2845,0.3425,0.0124,5.635,5.929,3.9576,0.3515,3.7838,9.3956,2.3747,6.624,3.6938,0.4146,0.0271,4.6373,1.9576,0.3293,2.9484,2.0484,0.119,2.2544,5.5826,4.4974,3.7451,1.7737,4.2419,8.2884,0.4597,1.0193,5.4113,5.4364,2.1447,4.1306,2.3479,3.0197,1.3193,0.3194,0.226,2.1713,1.0825,5.9019,7.66,2.4749,3.879,1.0214,1.1206,7.8924,0.0005,1.5524,1.8486,2.3775,0.2345,1.9393,0.7128,4.9854,6.9025,3.6384,3.7465,1.4961,1.1141,1.8814,2.1147,3.6423,4.7214,1.1357,3.8386,2.3487,6.9382,1.1416,2.2001,5.3329,4.2469,4.4107,4.1636,6.123,0.4651,2.7607,2.7263,5.322,0.0003,3.429,1.0182,5.0616,3.0603,4.2719,0.0394,6.1573,7.6616,0.937,0.4695,5.2595,2.9782,2.8567,2.0016,1.4751,3.5643,0.4397,3.1687,7.135,2.9048,5.473,0.1751,0.1987,4.7328,2.0754,3.6503,2.3582,2.3517,2.3013,0.2156,3.7994,4.4144,1.1604,4.8092,1.2453,3.1888,0.1277,1.436,1.3966,1.8017,5.784,3.5826,5.6618,3.0567,0.6422,0.7152,5.1515,0.3536,0.7839,4.1959,1.8404,6.5534,0.4584,0.8872,4.5609,1.9668,1.4169,4.823,0.142,2.3044,4.095,1.967,1.8827,0.7538,0.0031,0.3713,2.159,6.082,6.1917,1.8298,1.0895,1.2809,2.0168,0.7717,0.5025,0.4869,0.0062,0.5146,6.535,1.9523,1.2273,2.442,6.2802,2.925,6.1469,1.6601,1.0573,3.812,0.4117]}
{"prompt":"Write a story where each sentence begins with the next letter of the QWERTY keyboard .","text":"Write a story where each sentence begins with the next letter of the QWERTY keyboard. Do this in the order that you would like it to be written from bottom to top. For example, in the example sentence:\nHere is a little quiz that will tell how well you know the alphabet or whether you're a complete novice in the matter. Choose a letter and find out if you can find the following word. If you don't find it at first, just try on another letter.\nThis letter quiz takes a little time and concentration but you should be prepared. Remember that you can write anything from 0 to 10 at the end of the test.\nThe keyboard contains a total of 104 (one hundred four) letters, each letter is represented by a series of one or more lowercase or uppercase letters. You can use a keyboard, mouse or your finger to move to the next symbol, which is represented by the first letter of the word. For example, the first letter of 'keyboard' would be K.\nIn general, you should use the same letter from the beginning to the end. However, because there are certain situations in which it may not seem correct to use the same letter, let's take a look at the following examples:\nIn the following example, we use the uppercase letter 'G'; the first letter of the word 'glider' is 'g'.\nIt turns out that although we use the same letter, in both sentences, we have to use a different number of letters. This is why many people think that we use the letters more or less correctly, but what actually happens is that we write using what the computer considers as the letters. Even so, we are taught from the beginning that the letters are to be used with the same spelling.","token_len":366,"entropy":[4.0641,5.7875,5.9173,6.517,4.7983,4.17,0.1817,1.9954,5.3357,2.7283,1.7931,0.4927,9.9106,1.8972,0.0078,1.5549,0.9528,6.0669,2.3661,2.9913,1.8193,1.5565,2.208,0.6547,2.7836,0.6813,1.6238,0.3197,1.6736,2.3299,6.1584,5.5674,0.269,0.0378,0.5324,3.1409,0.195,0.3158,3.3407,0.9185,3.1136,3.8036,2.5927,1.1428,12.2327,1.1746,1.546,5.4086,4.6006,2.6879,1.8812,3.9435,5.6762,4.1646,0.4729,1.1816,1.0332,2.8192,5.8207,6.748,0.5914,3.2583,2.0063,4.7074,3.6813,3.1863,1.3772,5.4034,1.1374,6.6409,1.5747,2.1675,2.8425,5.8304,1.4839,2.5297,1.1661,1.4969,4.2368,1.597,4.5814,3.81,2.3693,2.4055,0.4793,1.9723,0.0006,1.3772,1.331,5.169,1.9884,0.4579,3.6375,2.9852,6.6155,2.4314,0.5445,1.0098,1.7305,4.5807,5.5128,6.5057,4.6494,1.8087,1.8615,1.9363,2.0868,6.8057,3.7695,2.8867,1.9497,0.8715,5.9334,1.8007,4.9109,1.1085,1.6007,1.2641,3.8345,3.7819,2.9035,4.0216,0.3827,2.7499,5.3182,2.801,1.8388,0.4032,1.0739,4.7085,0.5911,0.9431,2.6975,6.6946,6.1385,1.4053,6.5079,0.0704,6.8585,5.9171,5.8371,4.0054,3.5139,1.5737,1.5462,2.0341,2.795,2.4831,3.678,3.1211,0.5153,0.8203,4.8573,0.0168,6.1554,2.9778,0.6317,7.7852,0.3531,5.7223,3.3118,0.0013,0.0023,0.4372,0.4436,2.991,0.4375,1.9534,2.7289,2.1564,4.7943,1.8371,1.0749,4.9221,3.4313,0.212,3.192,5.8205,1.2756,0.6863,6.1933,2.5605,4.2131,1.1929,2.5488,0.1985,1.5632,4.3201,0.5114,0.3652,0.5199,3.8081,0.5964,3.0319,0.1886,0.2963,2.3869,1.9928,0.3116,0.3276,5.1143,7.4945,2.6346,0.4158,3.801,0.3073,7.367,1.2115,1.2204,3.4741,5.1728,0.1434,1.5976,1.3219,1.8134,1.459,3.9291,3.1991,5.5711,1.2478,1.9469,1.6454,0.3992,0.0249,2.5313,3.2969,0.0154,5.3552,2.9244,0.3029,5.0581,5.2386,1.6887,0.18,3.2667,2.6302,1.6873,4.1804,4.7493,0.6341,1.0768,1.3957,1.3303,0.2301,1.5202,5.7169,0.5505,2.7494,0.4077,0.4748,0.1851,1.6478,2.5347,2.1086,1.1031,0.1653,2.7818,0.8803,2.2199,0.7034,0.3265,2.0843,2.5468,0.8364,5.7537,0.0102,0.0076,0.4179,1.0489,4.6354,5.301,2.5632,2.1132,0.1998,0.5009,1.0088,0.3242,0.6593,6.7893,6.0954,0.1478,0.9568,1.0941,2.4249,1.75,1.5698,4.9957,4.1994,0.0011,0.1996,6.1099,2.8719,2.0135,0.7863,1.7429,0.3359,2.1144,3.7657,4.5665,4.987,1.2114,1.5942,2.6741,2.1492,1.4925,1.8262,0.4808,4.088,0.7837,0.563,0.7211,2.5996,1.0205,3.2996,5.0378,1.1618,2.8489,0.5338,2.8776,1.4275,1.2476,2.6129,7.1664,3.2956,0.008,3.0841,2.2663,1.3437,4.7337,4.1416,0.7408,0.4213,0.104,1.1718,3.8173,6.2662,6.0609,3.7334,4.069,4.9825,3.3133,1.1081,3.2445,1.682,6.1935,3.8694,0.018,2.2589,3.0345,6.7608,5.157,0.9268,0.5666,0.7359,2.03,0.9481,0.8939,5.2669,0.2272,0.6788,2.9557,1.5298,1.7356,5.8814,1.5659]}

I was relaxing in the yard. I pulled a chair up there. I laid on the grass and looked at the clouds rolling by. Suddenly, a storm came over the horizon. I watched as the clouds started to gather. I could make out distant lightning that was starting to flash. Then a flash of lightning struck on a tree. And there was a screeching sound in the air. I felt the trees start to shake. My eyes went white. Suddenly, I felt the ground start to move. The trees started to shake. I looked up, and as I looked up, I saw a flash of white light that shot through the sky. I shut my eyes, and felt the ground start to move. Suddenly, everything hit me all at once. The ground shook. I hit the ground. The ground shook again. I slumped on the ground. It felt like I was dying. I realized that I was dead. The next thing that I knew, was that I looked up to see my mother standing in the yard. She was wearing only her pink tights. She was holding a bouquet of flowers. I opened my eyes. She was smiling at me.","token_len":367,"entropy":[6.655,1.9792,2.1672,6.6037,0.8118,4.6869,1.5535,11.9837,2.1345,5.3789,3.4108,1.0873,7.6203,4.3968,0.0338,0.7329,4.0362,6.1308,5.4571,2.6866,1.7401,2.9544,6.2485,8.2689,1.4683,4.0254,0.8237,3.4529,6.293,4.955,1.8943,2.0104,3.183,1.4742,3.6449,0.6177,4.0534,3.0736,4.0738,4.2251,2.0191,7.2865,2.1522,0.0878,2.5798,6.002,0.1296,0.5397,4.5793,1.0924,5.7847,1.5312,5.6147,1.1643,1.083,1.56,2.19,3.0828,3.9239,0.7388,0.3314,0.1064,3.88,1.8996,1.6084,2.8279,0.5359,5.625,7.154,2.6715,4.008,1.7333,4.9189,0.0926,4.8998,1.8011,0.8492,3.3938,1.0899,3.2583,0.3933,4.6589,2.6515,4.6099,0.0004,5.4147,1.5428,5.3248,6.5213,0.8304,3.2716,7.619,0.6724,4.2448,1.0787,0.1256,2.3278,0.4475,3.6243,3.6813,3.4117,1.6229,3.865,1.8072,1.4808,0.808,4.8934,9.1682,2.3575,3.4437,2.0208,4.3828,4.6924,3.775,3.9233,3.9401,1.9187,0.0102,0.3618,4.4105,0.6909,4.4038,3.3059,1.3682,7.159,2.3458,1.4777,1.5035,3.4058,1.4962,2.2976,1.1602,4.9879,1.0122,1.1461,5.0548,1.3653,1.1697,5.8657,2.1275,3.5459,1.7436,6.2165,1.359,0.9992,5.2809,2.1037,1.1771,3.4423,1.7095,2.2615,0.9723,0.6463,4.8969,6.8179,3.6492,0.2899,4.0856,0.6018,1.9652,4.7736,1.7747,1.868,0.6218,1.8404,0.343,1.0555,4.9205,1.5524,0.9238,1.1394,3.5334,0.23,3.5048,1.158,0.9516,4.3574,5.0655,0.0323,7.4432,5.5177,4.8081,1.2733,6.1052,0.0483,4.085,0.968,3.4212,2.7359,3.5995,1.5259,1.8268,2.5766,4.911,2.7987,1.6099,0.795,4.3818,4.0745,0.8252,0.8908,8.0138,0.5742,1.0212,3.5711,0.1733,2.2203,0.2463,1.3316,3.454,2.0752,4.8722,3.7105,0.1009,2.7778,0.5276,3.5509,2.4447,2.5431,6.8509,0.5557,3.913,0.3372,1.0426,1.8439,1.8002,2.7402,3.0851,0.0916,3.0942,0.6995,2.5116,2.6289,0.9721,0.1689,1.5365,0.6653,1.05,2.3425,1.5001,2.6214,0.7006,5.8325,0.4783,0.606,1.4917,0.3571,0.9283,0.4158,1.1645,4.268,0.1988,3.5587,0.9628,2.9702,4.9482,1.943,0.2525,1.4772,0.2734,1.144,8.0804,0.0637,0.039,1.709,0.4467,3.734,1.0646,1.0438,2.323,0.0505,1.043,1.039,3.7881,0.1409,5.5115,4.6319,0.8045,7.0008,0.2145,0.0146,0.2765,2.3687,1.5861,2.8042,0.9757,0.9268,6.2644,0.738,0.0784,1.9357,1.8316,1.2754,1.3742,1.4092,0.2235,1.0676,7.9476,2.5611,0.4235,0.6053,0.9677,3.2297,2.6529,0.4312,1.1566,0.508,3.657,0.2357,0.9946,5.3818,0.8319,0.9844,0.8693,2.1339,0.2417,2.6508,3.7624,0.9009,4.0429,2.0016,0.9959,0.1558,6.0028,0.5462,0.8363,5.0952,1.2625,3.2049,0.7228,3.0317,2.4673,1.772,1.9171,0.4322,2.5722,0.6729,1.1306,0.5667,3.3626,5.0543,1.716,5.2251,3.4501,1.0096,0.5257,1.2578,0.8423,1.9551,0.83,4.7257,0.0002,0.2472,0.2942,0.669,1.154,4.8101,0.246,0.1112,1.6777,2.2418,0.3957,2.9318,1.8505,0.0491,0.2736]}

Before any of them can begin their sabotage mission, they bump into each other. That is when they notice our Agent Jane Banner on the ground on mission. Agent Banner is in charge of taking control of the missile, stopping it from launching and protecting those inside. Who takes over the game starts to change as one person tries to take control of the Silo while the rest stay in a waiting position. Your job is to take control of the game from the beginning to a secure position. There are various levels of control to the missiles. Every time the missile goes out of the control of the game there is the potential for the missiles to become disabled. This could have devastating effects. You must be careful! As the game continues the levels get more challenging and the missile has to be moved, rotated, and pointed in various directions. If you lose the missile the game will end. Luck is key and your reflexes must be good to keep the missile moving. This game has been fully optimized for a modern game system, so the graphics look great. The game was tested with a high setting in the most recent version of Windows. While the game is not overly complex, it does have its challenges.

In Hebrew : pillar = stalk of a plant - YEHOVAH is the stalk, the yoke of iron for the people he has made the heir of.\nRevelation 22:5 He shall have dominion, and he shall reign for ever and ever : 18 And the lambs of YAHWH shall feed him.\nThe Hebrew word for lamb is the one and the same - LEBEIN in Hebrew.","token_len":367,"entropy":[6.7025,3.1282,4.642,0.0004,5.7624,2.2146,2.8249,0.8553,3.169,9.0745,5.9363,7.9822,2.5831,10.894,1.4186,4.6149,5.5302,3.2834,0.1482,0.4674,4.9319,2.5664,4.2929,8.7469,4.7943,9.499,9.3058,5.0673,9.7758,1.4802,2.5388,13.6819,1.2027,6.8826,3.743,4.2658,6.1909,0.2225,5.6067,0.8233,8.0434,3.8344,5.5549,6.5342,13.1128,1.3295,2.3248,9.8187,5.6472,3.2819,0.057,5.0355,2.1307,5.0346,3.3425,2.7506,3.3816,4.5782,2.1573,1.4437,1.7844,4.7712,0.0383,0.699,1.0815,4.0234,2.3192,5.3559,8.2055,3.1563,2.8291,2.9419,5.0755,1.6115,7.0091,0.2276,0.0463,2.6446,0.0167,2.9491,6.1583,5.997,5.0603,3.3961,3.0108,1.1816,3.7962,3.3618,5.349,0.2009,0.6115,1.7849,6.0853,3.5727,3.3758,0.2263,3.9718,6.5031,2.2216,1.6099,7.6466,0.0467,1.6719,0.0872,6.8734,2.6454,1.5779,0.0107,1.0756,3.7968,1.4753,5.4675,1.1742,1.8247,2.9751,8.4231,2.3691,0.8369,0.2132,1.2729,3.8527,1.9156,1.8931,3.945,0.0031,5.4786,5.3856,10.2941,1.4949,3.0395,5.159,2.3764,3.5348,1.5845,3.8195,1.5209,7.3713,5.2409,3.5706,2.4227,1.1375,2.5187,4.7724,3.947,5.0861,6.6655,8.1426,2.6473,1.3431,0.004,0.0035,3.8361,0.0036,3.1466,6.196,0.1326,0.4879,1.2881,6.251,3.6053,0.8318,3.0783,3.3159,4.6076,3.7161,5.3437,2.1218,1.4306,3.2689,2.0639,0.4429,3.6722,7.1098,1.1151,0.1794,0.5696,1.6283,0.3855,3.1598,1.8637,2.559,1.445,1.5401,0.5914,2.7875,10.1263,0.6793,0.1273,1.4124,0.4896,2.0798,5.8373,0.415,1.558,6.2188,5.451,2.111,9.6451,5.484,0.0142,2.9362,3.2614,0.4618,4.0543,1.3249,2.3125,5.5659,3.4152,0.8273,5.3586,1.4299,3.4286,0.7721,3.267,1.2582,1.2095,2.4353,3.8536,6.0908,1.3627,3.8193,5.3668,1.7279,1.4032,0.2111,7.2207,4.4129,1.5308,1.7694,2.3719,0.1046,1.0193,0.623,1.1273,0.9445,3.1744,1.8673,0.0367,1.4561,5.8794,0.6264,1.093,0.0362,0.838,2.9117,1.3397,9.6539,3.5906,5.9497,5.1547,0.0018,3.7415,4.1673,0.0249,2.2528,2.9014,3.6262,1.789,3.4341,0.8807,1.3168,0.11,3.0822,0.9916,0.446,3.6846,6.1169,1.7998,2.7379,1.2594,3.1632,2.7426,4.0783,6.3261,5.9128,0.8274,12.6938,4.8403,2.4302,1.7519,3.5919,2.3062,7.9281,6.6751,3.498,5.2252,3.216,3.1379,4.7709,4.7177,8.6332,4.1709,1.4224,0.3357,4.0416,1.2362,7.3395,3.2827,2.0689,6.8233,1.8716,1.3265,8.6915,5.6946,1.7512,6.1871,6.9472,2.4414,2.0442,3.9572,7.8882,0.3601,1.6656,1.4756,2.842,0.0087,0.0074,3.0289,0.0048,3.6947,3.5651,2.6417,3.4498,2.8876,4.6942,0.5849,2.6218,0.1035,1.7823,3.1958,0.0957,1.8048,0.0203,2.6155,8.8345,2.3916,2.4452,10.1114,0.2836,1.494,5.58,3.3883,2.3326,3.6138,4.8266,2.3881,3.0821,1.0426,2.0737,4.781,0.5983,0.4294,6.2883,0.517,3.0839,5.4594,4.2905,1.3581,0.5502,3.7145,6.8308,5.9496,5.4804,4.7628,0.8585,1.3806]}

Once your time runs out, you 'll be stopped by your final boss after a full battle sequence. This guide aims to help you get a good fight against your final boss if he should appear on your trail. 1. Don't take your eyes off him or she, you may end up dead, at least as far as us mere mortals is concerned. 2. Don 't shoot him or her all at once, you may find that he'll be able to counter your shots if you make a plan for each of his shots. 3. Don't give them room if you have to, you may still have the chance to get rid of him or her once you've worked out what he or she likes to do. 4. Make sure the bullets all hit him or her at the right time, it's the little things we miss and the ones we don't think about that can end our lives, it's just that simple.

They are probably convinced that they aren't going because God's not good.  But they aren't going to hell or heaven.  And they aren't going to hell or heaven because they believed Jesus is the savior or they're going to get punished by God for their faith. \nThe bible isn't saying that if you believe you're not going to heaven that you are going to hell.  You could be going to heaven because you know there is a God and you are going to have to follow Him and do some good before you can be there.  This is what Christ was talking about.  It's not a punishment.  You didn't do any evil in this world so God can't punish you.","token_len":368,"entropy":[6.9031,1.4961,7.8555,5.34,3.3412,6.2942,3.0422,8.8773,1.9432,2.4936,2.6818,1.8946,4.4424,4.9152,3.0109,6.5926,4.7075,1.7386,2.9496,7.428,3.4587,4.6555,3.4249,4.5948,5.9781,3.4984,3.5475,3.7513,3.1568,0.4004,1.921,9.0882,6.0896,5.6633,3.2711,0.8601,5.9823,2.7736,6.065,2.4298,2.6904,4.3996,2.7307,1.2001,6.0638,1.074,6.3043,3.4025,1.1558,3.7698,3.4065,0.8127,1.1424,4.2745,2.8267,2.428,3.0174,6.4253,1.591,6.0596,0.6085,2.1636,1.2395,1.2247,2.2824,1.0311,4.3574,3.4141,0.7956,2.7865,4.4171,1.9106,4.8351,1.3635,3.8473,6.7592,2.2402,2.6305,7.7975,1.5906,2.3436,3.4629,0.2596,4.6431,0.0008,3.4469,0.1465,0.6521,1.1602,0.1842,4.1539,2.9757,3.0103,1.4373,0.4488,5.2591,2.5704,3.2117,4.0047,2.9333,0.3907,0.1967,1.8454,3.409,3.846,1.0328,1.3506,5.0451,6.9183,1.8732,0.7209,4.0961,2.6361,1.0673,2.5461,7.1999,2.1861,3.3005,3.994,2.4935,6.4708,6.3815,2.5085,1.5275,0.5498,6.1798,2.1233,2.4067,0.3237,3.3893,0.4408,1.0634,1.1149,2.9064,6.6051,0.216,2.7699,3.2933,3.443,1.3575,4.7521,3.2431,5.8986,3.2016,6.591,4.1283,6.2587,3.3153,0.6257,0.3704,2.9395,4.3363,4.2568,5.819,0.9081,2.12,5.4296,2.2773,2.8161,0.7783,7.9224,1.5081,1.6292,2.9805,2.6019,6.1126,0.4292,1.2157,3.8136,2.3547,0.4051,0.4296,7.4563,4.5868,6.9137,3.222,2.4292,2.4872,2.7369,3.4422,4.8931,3.7991,2.9759,0.0851,1.725,1.2806,2.0825,4.3232,3.0748,1.8166,1.0349,2.2761,2.8868,0.6996,0.1834,2.9196,1.4243,0.6429,3.3604,0.1243,4.8591,10.1379,2.3748,7.531,0.0054,4.8631,3.5771,4.2313,7.774,0.0011,6.6092,4.3919,5.4695,4.7519,3.8021,4.1086,1.2531,6.4291,3.0604,0.9682,7.4853,9.9029,1.6032,5.8181,4.3457,1.0568,1.0884,5.2453,0.001,0.6116,8.3596,2.9153,3.9621,3.8959,4.7942,2.0995,2.6723,3.3807,1.6683,3.3609,0.0008,1.7308,1.005,2.5812,3.4387,3.0901,1.2226,2.0812,2.853,1.3334,1.7838,0.0003,0.1124,0.0861,1.122,2.0068,0.4169,1.4917,1.0685,6.4389,4.3056,4.0296,1.7841,3.389,3.6716,3.0092,4.4242,1.5559,0.0742,3.7919,4.7912,2.8702,1.4839,1.4758,2.5034,2.0247,0.4352,1.8366,1.1524,4.349,6.4717,5.317,0.0004,3.2386,0.9926,4.0636,0.3937,1.0509,2.5235,1.8374,3.5761,0.2583,0.2563,1.3888,3.7138,0.5342,1.4348,0.6419,0.0679,1.4415,0.9852,0.713,3.7128,5.8845,1.3783,3.2152,0.9543,3.0719,2.8477,1.0418,4.2546,3.7587,1.0284,1.0855,2.119,1.9793,1.4257,2.4063,1.1238,0.0185,3.2175,1.3919,3.6253,1.4623,1.9187,4.1649,3.9262,0.9835,5.2322,0.9999,2.6021,2.0896,2.9528,0.3396,1.0698,4.7615,0.6875,2.6995,5.554,3.1653,3.0578,0.0025,1.1439,1.8859,3.4151,1.1349,1.127,2.4936,6.4106,1.4448,1.0533,3.0123,4.8805,0.0003,2.7455,2.9117,3.001,2.9326,2.8673,0.8754,4.5508,3.4424,2.8889,1.7915,0.3465,0.0436,0.9137]}

{"prompt":"A superhero finally kills his super villain for something unforgivable .","text":"A superhero finally kills his super villain for something unforgivable. Like a murder and he is free and so that is not right. So if there is a super villain he must have killed and he saved the day but he must have the villain killed because if we allow this then there are many people that may kill many people because like I just told you there should be no super hero there should be no good people and there should be no good villains. Like it would be so easy if there would be no superhero and there would be no super villains but then there would be no more great books and films.\nSo there is only a way to put the matter with justice. That is either there is a strong enough hero to defeat the super villain or there should be no such hero like that would mean the existence of no more great books and films. I don\u2019t know if Superman will get that justice now that he killed Supergirl or he will get that justice in 20 years. I believe in God but I believe in my eyes more than I believe in anything else. I am sure you are reading this and you are thinking of me. You probably have a story or book which you could possibly use as material to create your own superhero and you could put the idea in your film as the reason that you create the superhero but you must make sure that it is not an extreme story, you must make sure that you never lie and you have to show to a world that the reality does not match with the idea. So you would have to make sure that you don\u2019t lie.\nThere are hundreds of heroes and heroines in the Bible. We also have many stories where people became heroes and heroes like Joseph became a hero because of his ability to dream and the Lord gave him victory and he became a king.","token_len":368,"entropy":[11.3888,8.7114,6.6956,3.0769,5.7727,3.176,4.7868,4.9276,10.5256,0.0941,0.0172,1.0182,6.1314,2.7218,6.2051,4.556,3.5015,3.2013,4.6242,3.939,5.3973,6.249,2.0022,4.2,7.3287,0.4842,3.8397,4.1726,3.9551,0.6285,1.2659,5.3399,0.5206,4.6105,3.3396,2.6726,1.9266,3.0304,1.956,7.2009,1.8208,2.1717,4.2019,1.7898,3.0152,0.5389,6.8436,5.0234,2.2186,2.016,3.3961,4.3804,4.4697,2.718,3.8863,2.902,2.8976,3.2468,3.794,2.6185,4.6231,4.2006,7.3215,0.9204,3.3555,7.2014,2.2947,5.3202,4.0811,0.1206,2.7628,5.8931,0.2463,1.9784,3.7505,2.6431,4.0531,2.372,0.2401,0.5358,4.7054,3.8193,2.7502,2.1437,0.8157,0.2451,0.6808,1.0893,3.0363,1.1956,4.8978,3.8507,3.6651,0.6196,3.9195,2.4493,2.9595,1.1142,4.9794,0.1823,1.1561,3.9263,2.6782,1.4594,0.9193,0.2104,0.413,3.7279,3.0247,1.8086,2.9166,1.4671,1.252,0.2079,1.8093,6.4449,4.4611,6.7356,1.6021,7.1173,2.176,1.6894,7.4428,2.8958,1.1504,4.5423,3.507,5.6272,0.7631,5.6192,3.0808,5.2943,5.2111,4.9856,1.2947,3.7922,0.6437,7.4779,3.3592,0.7507,1.1081,6.1987,3.6257,4.0425,2.2798,5.2402,1.2126,1.9425,0.1569,1.4501,0.7813,4.6296,0.0773,1.6121,4.2342,0.4354,7.0793,1.9324,6.5816,5.6962,2.8504,5.6071,0.0482,2.7046,3.8953,0.598,0.9705,0.1865,0.6019,1.1202,2.9951,2.632,15.8334,8.2562,1.1174,1.657,1.685,6.6968,3.7666,4.3855,3.453,5.2529,4.9738,3.1933,0.6664,3.9518,6.3917,2.2832,2.2353,2.7089,0.5997,1.2122,1.3786,0.3402,2.6842,5.4559,0.681,1.2919,1.4978,4.1866,2.7495,4.5695,2.6177,0.9359,1.882,0.7012,3.9056,6.1869,6.4444,1.4533,2.1366,1.3397,0.1063,3.6937,1.2484,0.5766,1.3398,3.1658,4.2485,4.2149,2.274,4.413,0.6695,2.1031,2.0981,1.0466,2.5829,2.5488,2.4277,1.5346,3.1206,4.304,2.6424,2.6739,5.0193,3.1284,5.3485,4.9172,1.6157,4.9086,4.858,4.8504,2.2043,8.5911,1.8969,4.6445,1.8893,0.1464,3.2003,3.3483,1.774,1.9721,4.0762,2.9029,3.5952,2.0217,1.1894,9.2986,3.99,4.129,5.0694,2.7032,1.3135,6.0418,2.4021,1.7911,3.3652,1.3248,4.4844,3.3925,1.2052,0.5821,1.8193,0.8021,2.1142,3.6893,5.6121,4.3435,4.1138,2.6473,0.5266,0.9503,0.1222,0.3551,2.2195,5.0654,8.5505,2.3919,1.2725,4.391,0.5999,4.2307,5.4801,4.4842,3.6506,0.3573,3.0271,4.6447,5.0347,0.0633,2.6965,5.735,1.3079,4.188,2.0043,2.6247,2.2226,4.0071,1.1424,0.327,1.8873,0.2023,0.2638,1.2984,2.956,0.8418,0.3732,0.3165,1.2471,2.2157,1.8965,4.5302,1.2168,6.1813,0.2826,4.311,1.7534,6.5014,0.0664,2.0203,1.0526,4.662,1.693,3.7882,5.1661,0.5352,2.5588,3.5986,3.0857,2.8205,8.5723,1.7454,1.3695,3.2808,6.1569,5.4111,6.3949,1.1265,1.0711,2.3679,1.7581,1.0666,4.1961,0.1985,8.1193,1.0866,3.6582,5.5583,2.9747,0.2883,6.5766,1.8008,1.3983,0.8764,0.6479,4.2889,1.2641]}

You work at a Federal Eternal Rest Office. Your job is to work with the bereaved families to assist them to grieve and to cope with the loss. Life is long and can be spent in solitude. But the spirit is eternal and you can still maintain contact with your loved one even after they are dead... but you can't see them... you just feel 'em.\nThe Eternal Rest has been in existence in the USA for a while, now. You get on at the door and take what they call a 'photo' of the dead.\nThe first three days you'll be allowed to visit and spend as much time with them as you want. But three days is a short time, and you soon become aware that you can't see your loved ones. It seems you are living in a movie. You talk to your loved ones and then in another universe you get to hear them. It doesn't hurt like it did, and there's nothing at all there. No pain at all. But it really isn't'real'.\nAt the end of the day you give them their clothes. Your job is to get them ready for their final journey into the ground. This is no ordinary burial like you see in movies. You get to experience the funeral ritual. They lay next to your loved one and you talk to them. They open their eyes and gaze at you, and they smile. You see them die. There is no time, just this moment, and you are the only witness.\nWhen they die, a door opens behind them and nothing is there. Then they take flight to eternity... to a place where time doesn't exist, and the body fades away and you can't even feel it.","token_len":370,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5008,0.2783,10.6562,2.8413,6.2448,3.6448,5.95,5.7257,8.4489,6.9348,6.0506,1.5898,5.7194,3.8755,1.3257,0.4477,5.3095,0.5371,1.2378,5.661,8.1591,3.2965,1.5072,10.2858,12.6463,7.122,7.2075,2.4273,3.1065,2.4489,0.3309,0.2107,4.6351,1.424,2.0212,9.6485,0.0108,2.5234,1.7484,4.6941,0.6171,3.2678,8.8656,0.0035,1.5829,2.3737,6.009,0.4336,0.8902,1.1697,1.904,6.5209,1.3307,4.9699,1.2285,6.1952,0.9512,6.2233,1.5838,4.9741,0.8882,3.3445,3.13,5.4234,2.7319,6.0007,1.5289,1.8288,2.4182,4.6167,6.8319,5.4331,0.1791,1.5109,0.1823,2.4159,4.6837,2.0693,2.5161,1.9816,1.3585,6.598,5.8143,1.712,2.0196,0.664,5.5171,1.6069,4.605,2.5385,4.3327,4.1529,6.7398,3.5721,1.2748,2.0738,6.1969,5.3279,0.3057,6.6082,1.7493,2.9416,1.987,4.7018,1.259,4.1902,0.9338,3.6958,4.2073,2.0376,4.9485,3.3062,3.4176,4.7487,5.384,4.7823,1.3576,6.0473,1.3448,4.1744,5.7943,4.5752,3.2274,1.1228,1.1807,7.0892,2.2307,1.1214,1.7094,2.613,0.8764,3.9794,2.1638,4.2909,6.3367,2.683,2.8462,3.9177,1.2461,4.6612,0.3394,3.3018,3.7381,4.6041,5.9673,0.5397,0.0195,0.9645,1.2444,0.0929,0.1727,1.1203,0.5972,3.0197,7.7031,0.1777,2.7214,1.8196,3.5867,1.0697,2.1194,1.1683,1.4046,7.4714,3.0938,3.0162,0.8152,1.3312,2.8131,0.6504,2.5014,2.6483,0.2569,0.5116,1.2123,3.3542,4.49,2.8938,2.6233,4.153,0.7859,0.8159,7.5856,1.7523,1.7283,5.48,0.4664,1.9796,1.46,0.3119,1.62,3.5851,6.134,5.0009,7.4278,1.1905,3.5379,0.6222,4.1093,1.6481,3.5251,2.7894,3.7388,0.0004,5.3103,7.2045,1.7442,1.9177,6.0608,2.3015,3.8687,1.288,1.9337,6.3149,0.1541,6.7816,0.7696,5.196,5.0602,3.5205,0.0383,0.4208,3.9989,2.3794,5.5756,4.2104,0.0004,14.0421,4.601,8.6111,1.0625,4.623,1.2204,0.5218,0.1093,0.6731,0.7718,2.1776,6.6952,1.4188,3.5427,6.6521,1.942,3.6292,3.7395,0.1459,0.1423,3.5875,0.599,4.1304,0.6264,1.8489,3.2932,3.9277,4.1111,0.8085,9.1204,0.3984,4.3337,0.689,5.6148,2.5959,5.3881,6.8821,1.9472,2.8439,0.6638,1.9404,0.712,1.591,3.6085,1.1791,4.8748,1.1826,6.138,5.4064,2.0488,4.053,5.5533,5.3215,0.0023,2.9136,1.8348,1.4199,1.4991,1.9613,5.1259,0.4268,0.1406,1.2476,1.7439,5.6578,0.4066,0.6656,0.6412,6.6337,1.0982,0.3554,2.4851,1.634,2.3116,2.7515,1.086,1.7688,3.2035,1.6859,5.1182,1.1091,4.0069,1.3017,1.0502,4.4345,4.4272,3.9115,5.8115,1.9155,1.8955,1.5397,1.2331,2.8357,4.5654,2.209,6.2359,0.8374,1.1377,3.7731,2.0974,1.3374,0.5584,5.1354,7.0347,0.5404,2.2782,0.7499,1.2572,8.4376,1.863,3.7817,0.4294,3.4894,1.9448,4.7942,6.8421,3.642,7.9263,3.6806,4.6493,2.1961,1.0708,1.1578,5.5954,4.4826,0.0011,1.629,2.4286,1.5131,2.8798,4.6196,7.0049,1.3207,3.1239,1.7237,2.108,1.5971,3.792,3.7391,1.2597,0.548]}

This seems like a great way to go, until you hear one of the aliens says \" But what if there is something else we need more strongly than the resource to keep the species functioning? ''. Then the narrator starts to get a little freaked and says \" Oh no, what do we do? \". And then the whole thing just blows up. And the scene moves on and then the next scene is in the middle of space. And the alien species is talking to itself and then its an alien ship being torn apart by space debris and all that.\nThe Alien is a terrible villain. What he is does is not rational, or even remotely human. He needs to be stopped. But what he wants is a little rational. You know he wants to survive, but there is another resource out there, and when you find it it will save the planet. But the reason you stop him is because he wants to save the planet.\nAt first, the Alien has little respect for human life - he is not willing to kill anyone for their resources. I think this is one of his few virtues. He is a man, he has a moral, rational and ethical conscience. He is also incredibly lazy, for the most part, he doesn't fight back when humans are in his vicinity. The only time I can think of he has fought back was when he saw the woman on her own. He is so weak that he is completely defenseless when it comes to humans. At first he thought she might not have been really human - he didn't see her face ( but we know otherwise ). But he saw blood. This was enough to send him running for his life.","token_len":370,"entropy":[9.7836,4.0777,2.506,9.6265,2.6672,0.0267,6.9306,2.6868,0.0468,4.7698,1.847,9.9547,2.9457,9.679,4.4062,5.5738,3.1366,5.7796,2.0713,3.7861,4.6189,8.5689,6.018,2.5319,10.4708,14.7259,6.3539,6.6738,3.2782,4.1228,3.0387,5.9177,0.9972,0.5272,2.1247,2.113,0.1189,3.981,2.0642,6.2398,0.7195,3.5804,4.601,0.4673,0.8201,2.315,5.1005,2.6868,9.04,3.2293,1.0887,3.6841,1.4844,2.1119,2.7102,3.5318,2.9468,6.001,11.5142,1.6495,3.0059,6.9037,4.3589,3.5206,2.904,6.6905,5.3756,1.4481,6.8109,7.4378,4.0456,2.3003,9.0923,3.9885,1.5109,3.1944,2.6729,0.7895,4.552,0.0637,6.187,1.6191,0.6162,4.5098,3.1622,0.9179,3.4938,3.4308,1.3659,1.3982,2.4229,4.3445,3.3975,1.5379,1.6951,4.3715,1.2977,2.4592,4.4659,0.1835,0.9565,3.3127,2.7063,7.0348,5.607,1.7887,2.9967,3.6179,1.4808,4.2332,2.6946,2.2871,5.141,1.5041,2.2361,0.4809,7.7016,1.569,2.3369,2.2211,2.8944,2.6525,2.0006,4.9513,1.3396,3.7447,1.9778,2.6938,5.4381,6.496,1.1285,7.8139,5.7835,6.0069,0.4262,1.2818,3.3229,1.6711,2.4573,3.634,1.3065,1.341,2.885,4.4543,4.0175,3.4853,1.8749,6.3511,4.889,1.187,5.545,2.6033,2.5519,4.9816,4.6009,4.5222,8.8406,1.4982,4.4467,2.1024,5.152,2.9485,0.7329,1.2804,5.5563,0.9302,0.9842,4.3252,1.1353,3.0984,2.6297,1.0316,3.9625,0.7448,2.5948,4.6375,9.6685,2.4908,4.6357,1.8608,3.6692,1.6917,0.7559,5.6582,1.554,1.6884,3.6993,0.967,4.4065,8.2794,3.6787,0.01,2.1344,1.2618,4.8406,1.4329,3.8547,1.1076,3.3884,2.578,4.1993,2.3741,1.9215,0.6764,3.1028,2.5217,4.5112,3.3187,5.4606,0.6024,0.3171,0.6231,0.9211,1.9264,0.632,3.4575,1.4714,0.8421,0.7091,2.0531,5.6854,2.5568,1.698,1.8103,3.1583,3.4582,5.2104,5.0097,0.0765,2.3115,1.5305,5.4133,1.4418,2.0498,2.8944,4.1949,0.0295,3.6906,2.266,2.6801,3.5647,5.9363,0.6711,5.1573,1.5391,2.8721,0.5266,3.202,0.2067,2.6831,5.7924,5.4892,0.7862,1.6258,1.5373,1.9472,4.2071,3.7582,2.0326,2.1007,1.456,4.6799,3.7051,7.7907,3.3358,3.5721,4.062,0.7034,1.3968,1.3785,3.6074,5.6196,6.6082,1.5059,5.7582,2.761,0.7923,0.0046,1.5824,3.1254,2.6072,0.0011,7.9312,2.7737,3.4294,5.4769,1.2936,3.3384,4.391,6.4516,0.45,3.5565,1.7781,1.8198,2.3504,3.4949,1.1728,0.0461,3.3206,2.9898,3.99,0.3312,3.1083,0.8127,0.6432,4.9401,1.6824,6.7478,3.3936,4.2883,4.2591,1.9143,1.6858,2.379,3.3407,4.8265,1.7157,0.914,2.5258,4.839,7.0456,0.0144,0.0,3.1009,2.6547,0.0638,0.0194,3.3693,0.53,5.5064,1.2443,1.2892,3.7893,2.2774,3.8807,3.2615,2.6265,2.4176,5.7396,3.733,3.341,1.8658,3.252,0.0008,3.2273,1.3053,3.4402,6.0384,6.9762,5.0985,2.3807,7.5818,1.7492,1.0542,2.0319,4.3009,8.2385,2.7255,5.0687,2.1739,5.8673,0.5004,4.1831,0.5757,2.8276,1.8366,0.9631,0.0729,0.57]}

{"prompt":"We live in a universe where you can not die from natural causes , instead every so often the Grim Reaper will come and try to fight you to the death .","text":"We live in a universe where you can not die from natural causes, instead every so often the Grim Reaper will come and try to fight you to the death. However, I want you to understand this is not a war but rather a battle where every time you give your life will make it easier for the other person in life to hold you back. If your life is taken then that is good cause it will make it easier to live and get some of the things that you have missed out on because being dead would mean that all of them would pass by in a blink of a eye, it would also mean that none of you would have to work so damn hard to get them, your family could all work together, everyone of you can become richer. But, if you give up then someone will want to make sure that they will live. To make sure that this is not happening I have to tell everyone in my life to make sure that our lives are filled with more positivity and more love and that we have made a lot of amazing friends in life. If you are alive and at the same time you are dead and can not feel any life in your body then I strongly recommend that you go and join a suicide group, this will make everyone in your life feel happy and no one will ever have to say that you are not important anymore, and you should make sure it is a well known group because if someone finds out they will stop you in your tracks and you will not be able to commit suicide because of them and even worse they will even tell your family that you have taken your own life because they will make it impossible for you to get your money back, they will even say that you have killed yourself, this is nothing but bad karma and it will make you believe some negative things about you and all because of one person in life.","token_len":372,"entropy":[7.009,0.2657,0.4139,5.9723,0.6568,3.3251,0.8311,5.6043,6.0759,3.8301,4.2928,0.336,1.5776,6.8553,6.9457,6.849,0.0034,3.2787,11.2341,0.0868,1.8598,2.8601,1.8669,4.3243,0.1216,6.6641,0.3974,3.4876,0.9893,0.3496,0.6358,4.5643,0.3512,3.5305,4.5081,1.3654,0.1272,2.5111,3.4341,1.6292,0.9651,1.4008,4.7595,4.2935,1.9161,0.4529,2.9681,4.3169,4.0987,3.6979,0.6129,5.2114,2.7841,0.4816,7.9152,4.2575,2.8361,2.7841,0.4449,1.1557,4.2148,3.5534,4.087,6.4341,0.1956,6.3875,1.9745,1.558,0.7059,3.387,3.1678,1.3708,0.6736,2.6662,4.2484,3.2805,2.215,4.9038,6.3742,4.1248,1.4931,1.8173,1.6264,0.6468,1.9832,4.3143,2.1951,4.9983,4.829,3.1255,0.8326,3.3336,1.5029,0.5706,3.0156,5.3801,1.2219,0.0725,4.3298,7.715,4.458,4.4954,2.719,1.6967,4.7079,0.9854,3.0138,1.755,6.6422,4.1048,3.7339,1.3501,3.0327,0.1218,4.5439,0.2442,2.995,4.0525,0.7849,3.3407,1.3017,0.2752,5.7451,0.0667,2.0247,0.5768,2.1115,0.9373,4.4482,2.8291,7.7434,0.0211,0.4329,1.3558,3.7104,4.8782,5.1958,4.4294,4.8716,2.9667,4.6439,3.6068,2.5901,5.4196,3.7624,0.6798,4.4297,4.8484,6.3595,2.9942,3.9216,3.0259,2.1366,0.611,2.698,1.762,2.5687,6.3415,1.3167,5.1227,0.3976,4.1065,1.2857,0.773,2.6818,3.2915,4.0235,2.714,5.556,3.1275,1.1323,0.5964,3.7739,1.4073,0.71,2.8625,3.6387,2.335,3.2221,2.3458,4.371,3.0618,2.0001,1.6602,2.5495,4.2034,0.233,0.3413,5.1465,1.6831,0.5704,5.2983,0.1787,5.6442,8.6782,0.0149,0.9405,3.0948,1.9444,1.6032,2.0967,1.1521,3.0547,5.3733,1.8068,3.3818,0.0857,6.9825,1.6087,3.3556,1.7992,0.7362,3.2152,0.754,1.9813,4.7751,1.3239,6.0418,1.8715,1.9708,0.0718,1.6408,1.075,5.3422,1.8712,5.1905,1.9316,4.4049,2.6408,6.4695,3.2171,1.1067,2.7087,1.2079,2.6664,4.2783,1.7361,0.5009,0.1559,3.5196,2.1764,4.5747,2.2502,5.2538,2.3269,2.8466,2.8362,1.5687,1.8999,4.5561,2.593,0.4758,0.1824,1.5293,4.3538,0.6251,6.6592,0.6705,0.7728,1.92,2.5841,0.1512,5.2479,2.1973,1.0711,0.7631,1.8129,5.0436,3.2465,2.1837,2.8217,2.491,4.0512,4.2969,1.0461,5.773,0.4974,2.6359,5.2053,2.3725,2.299,4.6302,2.705,3.4455,5.143,0.1652,3.2772,0.713,6.1318,4.0125,4.0468,3.0473,0.0265,1.33,2.6383,0.4485,2.4859,1.0906,0.3475,0.0029,6.3138,0.084,3.2486,2.3935,4.5211,3.2763,5.3163,3.6071,2.2516,0.2479,4.9965,4.0587,4.1856,1.1041,1.4002,0.485,2.4684,4.888,2.3885,3.2448,0.0318,1.9055,1.4779,1.8587,4.426,2.2871,2.8459,0.3862,0.4867,0.0806,2.5372,3.5438,3.6587,0.4185,2.393,2.3014,0.2197,1.3779,2.8827,0.2365,0.6118,1.7122,3.56,1.6228,2.4708,3.1429,0.918,5.3125,1.0968,4.7666,1.302,1.4146,2.5185,0.7663,0.9321,1.3268,5.1991,7.856,4.8534,0.5361,1.3205,2.1643,1.4246,4.816,7.0849,1.5184,8.5744,1.2458,3.8842,2.8977,1.358]}

Problem is , he died in a rather busy spot , so he 's not the only one .","text":"A man dies only to find that he goes into a parallel world where he can only move 200m from his place of death. Problem is, he died in a rather busy spot, so he's not the only one. So he meets others of his type who try to get rid of their pains as well.\nThis is a short story where a woman falls in love with a man - and is murdered for it - but she finds him and goes to meet him in another universe. Once there he is found to have a terrible secret about himself - and the relationship of their is also a part of an \"after\" story that has to do with a certain person (again, I don't want to say who ). She tries to save the man but he can't be saved - but she gets his heart back. The first book they had had the person who killed her in the last book (a man whom he believed to be her father ).\nI've tried to make the story sound as if it just came out of someone's head - the story is somewhat loosely adapted from a movie I saw - but in my world that movie and book had some events connected to each other so I just cut out a few important details. (The movie and book are fictionalized)\nThere is no way the guy could be sure he had died, except he died with one of the three people who were looking for him.

If it is your reality then you have the privilege we all take for granted at times. To be able to sit and think about your life. You are not just a reflection on the mirror. You are a person with feelings.\nSo while in those dreams you are the hero of your story. You see your actions and those of others, you can choose to get up in the morning and tell my friends what happened in my dream tonight and they can take those thoughts and share them. You can write them. You can make it come alive in a book or on video. You can turn it on and just enjoy it for eternity. You can sit on the porch with it and the wind will whisper in your ear about it and your imagination will take you to a fantasy world. And maybe you can choose to be the hero of the story while sitting in your armchair reading a book in front of the fireplace and you might learn something and maybe you can change someone\u2019s life for the better by it or by listening to your friend talk in your sleep about it.\nI thought of the man I met the other day who gave me a very nice and thoughtful gift.

{"prompt":"A normal day , 50,000 years from now","text":"A normal day, 50,000 years from now (unless your calendar is wrong by 50,000 years as it almost certainly is ), it is not at all unreasonable for life to have developed on our planet\nAll the planets with life have been bombarded with comets at least once in their lives by the current solar system\nThe impact events are not necessarily the cause of changes on the surfaces but the changes make it easier for life to evolve from the impact event.\nI think the current climate is changing for a number of reasons- a whole series of those are listed in the article linked to previously. Certainly, life will have been evolving for tens of millions of years under the current conditions, with no evidence whatsoever that the impact of comet or asteroid caused changes in the climate.\nWhen we get to 100 million years, there is no reason why we cannot expect life on earth to be much more prolifeable than it is now. We have only had a few million years to develop ourselves, when we get 100 million we may be able to evolve ourselves into an advanced species.\nIt will be interesting to watch the climate change through the future. I hope we have time to witness the evolution of life on earth after 100 million years.\nAt this point in time, my only reservation relates to the possibility of a collision with another larger body, for instance an asteroid or a comet, that changes the weather too much for life to endure. Perhaps there is a planet somewhere in the galaxy like Earth that is perfectly suited for life, but the weather is either similar (not too hot) or less (not too cold). Then one would be able to speculate if an impact with an asteroid would either be able to turn the habitable parts of Earth into an inhospitable world or if an asteroid is large enough, it would likely destroy the planet.","token_len":372,"entropy":[9.1293,4.2017,2.2042,8.0732,3.3051,0.1953,4.9807,3.744,0.0623,5.1046,5.2653,4.0085,4.8558,1.3168,3.9795,6.1247,4.2713,0.3756,0.018,0.5421,6.0414,2.8134,7.9611,0.844,1.0014,6.9559,3.3163,2.0399,3.1345,5.3858,0.1173,3.2757,1.927,6.6259,0.1652,2.6554,5.9854,4.594,5.7182,0.9034,6.8367,7.8982,2.4939,3.8015,5.4601,3.124,2.4593,2.0689,8.9074,0.0152,0.4713,6.6781,0.0233,5.6463,2.2208,1.4507,1.7421,0.9465,3.3856,4.6973,2.1836,6.765,3.0316,0.6034,3.2928,2.1538,6.6076,6.9209,2.4368,3.0401,4.9458,2.2095,3.6177,0.2123,5.794,3.699,0.9526,7.5071,4.375,1.9894,4.9346,6.6499,2.5449,2.8046,0.67,1.6847,0.1022,2.1458,4.2559,2.1131,6.8038,2.4124,2.2678,1.2415,4.2609,2.8283,2.009,4.8766,4.1947,1.2173,4.4487,5.2019,2.4264,1.88,0.0058,0.035,7.5451,4.4385,6.3448,3.4635,0.0908,7.5376,2.428,3.6648,2.3288,0.609,3.3352,5.0308,2.3947,7.4939,1.259,9.0505,1.6514,5.0305,2.9642,2.9145,3.0945,3.2773,2.0394,4.9436,0.3492,1.3052,0.0409,0.0062,5.2785,1.5173,2.4694,1.9751,1.6344,4.4991,2.8972,3.7239,4.9236,1.1577,2.5949,3.5882,2.6421,6.8843,3.0902,1.3969,6.6749,2.3266,0.9684,0.7581,3.1252,0.9534,0.8404,5.5116,2.3101,3.8649,0.9567,4.0027,1.599,0.0601,1.295,2.5922,1.1493,1.2712,2.5241,1.679,1.5843,2.1876,1.5006,2.6389,2.9684,3.3273,0.188,1.9983,3.6974,1.6561,9.9756,7.3729,9.2951,0.6449,1.6586,0.4742,1.1104,0.5036,3.2793,2.3795,3.7163,4.219,1.5657,0.7569,4.4239,0.1159,1.4581,3.1584,6.3177,1.4634,6.1266,1.5437,5.3287,4.4668,0.2158,4.0836,4.2398,1.9898,1.1851,0.021,3.1957,4.5691,3.4396,3.7924,3.0221,0.839,1.2087,0.8517,3.6726,3.6834,1.0689,0.7092,0.0394,4.0693,1.8399,4.8703,0.9643,6.9497,0.9614,4.723,1.7561,2.4105,3.0444,2.9834,2.5725,5.6991,0.4193,6.9863,1.5775,2.9819,0.1424,1.1339,1.1402,1.3995,5.6013,1.1311,0.0831,0.0353,0.8648,1.0595,6.2817,2.0796,0.342,2.3136,0.3746,0.5576,4.7182,4.0386,7.6324,8.5827,0.0428,0.8372,3.8547,0.7663,2.066,5.2834,1.0745,2.2485,7.7301,1.6975,2.3722,4.6622,2.8204,3.0212,0.2232,1.4988,2.6981,0.4671,2.3385,3.4706,5.6002,0.3952,3.6556,7.6463,0.3488,1.9228,1.5766,0.2539,7.9148,0.7049,4.8007,3.0489,0.9229,1.1251,5.0152,4.6572,1.7147,0.242,2.8365,5.517,1.7566,0.824,1.5869,6.2857,2.7694,0.6957,1.1397,1.5059,1.2896,3.3668,3.4388,1.3868,6.8136,8.2642,4.3892,4.8843,3.5229,2.4386,1.7515,0.3654,3.7233,2.509,1.5703,0.1365,0.0876,0.4725,5.1046,4.8734,4.7006,3.1907,1.7508,0.0076,4.7772,4.2027,4.2519,3.3472,3.2955,1.7473,0.3436,2.4606,7.2702,3.1313,4.8303,0.0063,5.257,0.9209,9.3746,8.4576,0.1807,1.87,0.5905,3.737,6.5079,0.0028,0.0005,2.5869,1.291,1.5006,3.2968,0.6985,4.297,6.2131,0.0167,3.3756,2.1203,0.8188,3.758,4.3786,1.1873,1.5566,1.3081]}

In fact, it \u2019 s no one \u2019 s model heaven, save for the person who got there first. But for all of me, I think we better take a chance. And what can we do with a chance? We can act. So we should always be ready to act.\nLife on earth is to be lived, but I also feel as if it \u2019 s not like that. Life on earth isn\u2019t simply a journey from birth to death, but with every breath during that journey. The journey may not be long, but the journey certainly includes many things you see, hear, touch, taste, know and experience. It is your opportunity to be all that you can be, and you are not going to pass it by. You don \u2019 t have to be rich, or handsome, or talented, or popular, but the ability to know God and His way and how to live life for His sake. You are a human being, not a simple one, not just a bundle of organs and bones.\nIf your father were to die and you had all the money and fame in the world, you wouldn\u2019t have anything to show for it. How is this possible? God gave us a gift called consciousness, and this consciousness gives us the value of life. Life is worth living and the value of it is the quality of it. The value of life itself is not the value of a car or money or fame, but of the quality of things we do, the way we think, the way we live, the way we love to help others, the kind of friendships we build, the quality of the relationships we have with people, and how our lives can make an impact on others.","token_len":372,"entropy":[3.7506,5.0656,6.8139,2.6968,6.6716,10.9905,2.0364,9.1552,0.6196,2.8982,15.4493,7.3589,7.7717,3.1212,3.1679,10.3213,7.1995,1.7361,4.8132,1.092,0.1261,1.3939,2.8646,0.1148,0.4476,5.429,4.3519,4.6487,0.011,0.7545,11.9286,3.2849,2.5517,5.7807,2.137,1.8369,5.9486,0.6003,6.6001,2.7837,1.8395,0.8903,3.2619,4.2389,3.5735,2.2794,5.8354,0.662,1.273,3.985,3.3665,5.9448,3.9771,2.438,4.145,2.1403,3.4361,4.6242,3.7886,0.786,0.2197,3.577,3.5552,2.497,1.2505,2.3243,1.1486,7.0689,1.7268,4.7285,2.1311,3.208,6.2393,2.2329,3.041,1.1574,0.7977,0.5273,2.5728,17.7069,4.3426,1.2523,0.7164,6.8033,1.0818,3.8351,3.0335,3.308,3.5391,4.3409,3.8814,3.9367,0.5667,2.8497,3.5637,0.0275,0.028,2.0142,5.3354,2.5583,0.4622,3.5628,1.3287,0.178,4.9476,4.3965,0.7313,2.133,6.5468,1.6833,5.6865,4.5766,4.3438,0.4439,0.4008,1.6999,1.0067,6.2442,3.7578,3.3875,8.6779,1.5669,0.7716,2.0808,3.4288,2.3794,5.5743,2.2256,0.6909,2.6121,0.6014,0.2293,2.0082,0.4964,5.7756,5.4236,2.3021,3.6436,4.9404,5.9149,2.2551,0.6917,0.3144,1.5723,0.4076,2.5408,0.3331,4.4778,2.3714,3.2683,0.5116,2.474,1.7312,4.5534,5.8174,0.3446,3.1742,6.2777,1.58,0.4751,1.2088,0.0735,1.4463,1.578,2.646,2.2554,2.369,2.7372,0.2821,4.8557,2.8697,2.5351,0.6505,2.3913,4.0138,2.0136,0.0252,6.4474,1.6148,0.6728,1.6256,5.5418,1.5755,2.0372,5.5353,0.3714,0.0287,4.1499,0.887,0.1103,6.8945,0.8567,3.9336,4.0779,6.806,0.1183,5.264,6.7751,1.8049,3.2691,5.0345,2.3367,3.0108,0.6046,1.4395,3.647,4.62,4.4575,1.4937,3.2182,2.2863,2.1655,3.6729,2.5711,0.0899,1.1641,3.3382,0.622,6.8174,4.8525,1.9017,3.8348,3.7168,0.7526,7.0864,0.08,7.7088,2.0008,2.2522,0.8624,1.8043,3.7812,4.4068,4.4497,3.9533,1.097,2.0244,2.4686,1.3219,2.9013,4.9536,1.4278,3.9286,1.8308,4.5405,3.7619,0.5446,0.0192,0.3904,1.393,2.4361,1.9881,0.0899,1.2143,1.4957,4.8551,0.55,4.0253,0.1597,0.1416,0.4986,5.6483,4.4971,2.8289,0.4848,0.2904,5.1366,3.4551,1.8358,2.165,2.8739,5.7722,7.5401,1.0816,1.2804,3.8122,5.146,3.5686,0.2727,1.3643,8.117,0.2825,1.9398,0.6766,3.8196,0.8862,4.3984,1.4415,3.4051,3.5139,1.5092,0.1707,4.4904,0.6141,3.0673,4.109,0.2043,3.2931,0.6067,2.7836,2.2728,0.1639,0.3804,5.7099,0.3713,2.462,2.6196,1.8382,0.1381,3.0746,5.9432,1.275,5.8966,1.3813,3.2488,1.2887,0.3577,1.8487,1.5626,0.4658,0.1408,5.8572,2.3951,2.7577,2.0215,2.2765,3.8871,0.1607,2.6378,0.6697,1.0566,0.3792,0.0757,1.6946,1.0338,0.6992,0.4401,0.1233,3.8717,5.408,6.1295,0.226,0.8336,0.8817,4.297,0.064,7.0947,0.368,3.8616,0.7603,0.4199,5.5379,0.0546,3.1704,4.0308,0.1051,1.3101,1.531,1.8032,1.0817,2.1827,3.4491,3.7985,1.6971,3.2338,4.0889,3.929,0.1979,0.5456,0.8731,0.3143]}

For example, you could write a story where a person drives by a restaurant and sees a beautiful, red rose hanging on the pole outside. The red rose might be illegal to display, but the person is sure that it is not. When the person gets home and turns on their radio and the station is a local one, there is an announcement that the owner of the restaurant is going to serve a free taco to the first person who drives by and sees the rose.\nD. The story will play up the differences between the two societies and explain what made the difference.In the story, there should be some examples to show how our society works that is unique.\nE. It is important that the audience understand and learn that the things that are important do not necessarily have to have a great value. The red rose doesn't have to have a high value, but it does give it to someone.\nF. The idea is that everyone is at a point in their lives where they feel insecure and have lost some of their faith. It may be because they were once a young adult who felt like they could make their own decisions and could make their own choices. They suddenly have a job in an industry where they are expected to be in charge of those decisions and choices now. That can make them feel like they are going to be fired at any single minute.The insecurity caused by that is what this story is about.\nG. It is important the story can make the reader understand the problem with the way these two countries interacted with illegal alien labor. The author should talk about what happened because of that. They have to be able to explain the problems with this situation.

The couple watches it and sees when they became a couple and how they got together so they can use this as ammunition in the ongoing debate about whether or not they truly love each other.\nHow many couples do you know who have never made a promise that if they find themselves married to somebody whom they don\u2019t love any longer, that they will happily divorce each other? How many couples do you know who still have the TV cameras rolling in their life even now, even after their wedding video\u2019s have been delivered to them?\nCraig David, whose lyrics I just found via the internet, sums up the state of affairs with the following: \u201cYou got the video.

I\u2019ve been stoned out for over ten years, been a drug addict for a good part of that time, been in a relationship with men that made me a living example of what\u2019s wrong with women, been an all around terrible mother and just about every other kind of loser you can imagine.","token_len":373,"entropy":[3.603,6.9251,4.2117,1.2815,0.7266,1.8165,2.5247,10.572,2.9144,7.4885,0.9172,1.701,1.1854,7.5094,1.4319,5.1389,0.5083,4.2448,0.616,0.7213,8.6567,1.3464,13.4714,2.1391,2.8908,3.4556,0.0001,0.8574,2.1973,5.1268,9.2074,2.0966,2.6386,5.116,5.917,1.0641,8.5479,3.7394,0.2072,1.7666,3.017,1.3582,4.279,2.8921,5.7331,1.7938,0.9756,5.7187,2.6567,2.7009,7.2427,2.4773,1.9218,4.6857,3.7395,1.4188,3.1347,2.3202,0.0021,2.5777,6.415,2.4095,0.2837,0.0096,0.2895,0.8132,12.049,2.1958,2.5558,2.5515,0.6531,0.8391,0.6934,1.2746,3.28,4.3068,1.5435,4.4727,2.9904,4.7076,0.2178,5.5602,1.2899,1.663,3.023,4.0203,5.7856,0.0676,3.1973,15.793,7.4959,2.5138,2.7725,6.0388,1.7786,0.424,2.669,0.3921,0.7465,7.2225,4.3053,5.703,0.1722,1.0754,2.551,0.042,0.782,1.612,0.0194,0.0612,0.142,5.8559,2.0037,3.1753,9.9299,3.4049,3.1158,2.7893,0.3948,7.3329,4.744,5.4952,1.6303,2.5893,2.1203,2.1824,2.7646,6.6149,13.1176,0.1624,3.068,0.8407,0.555,7.3822,0.8096,0.6295,1.1638,1.1033,11.0567,6.9005,2.1906,5.8689,8.8726,4.9427,5.2319,2.8457,6.5385,2.7284,2.5175,0.6099,5.9692,0.414,1.0062,6.0489,0.0309,2.3087,3.4738,2.3827,3.8856,1.8641,5.692,5.6442,5.5402,4.7768,2.9668,5.2607,2.4942,3.2866,2.7785,1.9828,0.8029,0.0495,1.5395,1.8248,0.7422,3.3235,0.2209,3.4548,6.1101,0.5392,1.2235,2.2491,2.9521,0.4014,3.6137,2.0107,4.9503,0.3188,0.5637,1.2115,3.9621,1.9622,0.3506,0.1201,5.3112,2.7176,3.1943,0.1701,4.0814,1.5605,0.1122,0.8476,1.5235,4.2096,0.5318,3.7774,2.449,2.902,4.971,1.1785,1.3531,2.612,3.7361,1.58,2.6771,0.5298,2.9505,2.794,2.2018,0.1356,2.1069,6.7791,1.0406,4.6122,0.0054,2.7724,1.4495,3.061,0.1247,0.9103,2.0458,4.1827,2.5679,2.5389,0.9248,3.0833,3.1089,2.1931,3.9147,0.2456,0.565,4.9879,3.1038,1.7302,0.2238,0.5586,1.2655,2.3357,4.2333,4.7516,2.6933,0.1305,4.3906,3.8451,1.1794,7.9293,0.7553,4.2417,0.3235,4.8608,3.169,1.6742,0.0203,2.597,1.5359,1.6775,2.2125,2.3374,4.9518,7.8718,3.877,7.1938,2.6165,0.0652,4.8105,4.8637,2.3253,7.068,6.9511,7.5083,0.3776,1.5651,2.1155,3.5375,2.6317,5.6965,1.8439,0.1479,0.8744,3.7583,1.505,2.0657,0.0925,1.9718,6.7808,1.3599,1.6195,4.8006,5.6696,2.7668,0.6821,0.6269,0.1856,3.6116,4.0825,3.7616,0.0097,0.8914,0.8611,1.8155,0.11,1.3387,1.583,7.8973,0.7874,4.8336,3.2542,3.2599,3.1025,0.1052,1.4221,6.8373,4.2549,5.4248,0.3497,1.3693,3.3177,4.8153,3.2444,0.0014,0.3528,0.1865,0.2896,2.5448,3.0554,1.644,2.0953,2.4853,5.6269,2.1529,4.7058,0.3283,3.1841,5.9692,10.4927,0.8967,2.1889,4.4074,0.2843,3.1641,1.7223,0.253,2.0149,0.7937,2.7043,4.5439,5.7624,2.0612,3.8888,3.4307,2.6803,6.6702,3.6476,1.9864,1.5343,4.418,0.0358,4.997,4.2541,1.947,1.8704,0.5478]}
{"prompt":"- A romantic love story between a blind woman and a deaf man .","text":"- A romantic love story between a blind woman and a deaf man. She has never let her blindness get in the way of her desire for love. Her husband, Nisan, has no hearing and is in his first year in Israel.\nOn his first tour, Nisan goes to meet a blind teacher for the deaf who he later meets when they have a chance to read Hebrew books together. Both are excited about the novel and learn what each other like.\nAfter a few days, Nisan calls her. He has a hearing problem: one of his speakers is broken at the factory that manufactures them and it will take time to get them mended. The conversation was very short and, to the best of Nisan\u2019s knowledge, the teacher for the blind is now dead. Nisan and his family are not informed of this.\nSixteen years later, Nisan is an elderly man, his wife, Boni, is living abroad. When Nisan is called into the local hearing clinic by his blind neighbor, Aharon, they decide to use Skype to talk to each other. Aharon, a man of his generation, is a bit older than Nisan and the conversation goes smoothly.\nA week after this Skype call, Aharon calls Nisan into his home, and he tells Nisan that his grandmother passed away during the Skype conversation.\nAharon describes how during the Skype conversation, they were able to read Hebrew together. They spent several hours reading passages from the Bible to each other and, in a way, the blind and the deaf were able to exchange their thoughts and feelings.\nThey learned that they shared some similarities: they were both blind and in their early years in Israel. As Aharon states, \u201cNisan was my hero and I am very happy he is no longer blind.\u201d","token_len":373,"entropy":[7.6686,9.3455,3.4688,1.0093,1.9805,1.8098,6.8768,2.7457,0.2827,0.5543,4.8196,0.3846,0.821,4.8333,2.6921,4.9809,6.4837,1.5128,5.4623,3.3108,0.7684,0.1015,0.0001,0.0595,0.5341,4.2067,0.9689,1.8728,0.6131,4.1317,3.9311,2.0804,7.254,6.2367,0.7153,2.0869,4.2544,6.6619,2.9096,2.0197,4.3351,3.2182,6.4252,0.5337,2.769,8.1068,0.567,3.2805,9.4682,3.9345,2.2511,5.0111,1.703,1.5586,0.0024,4.5164,0.8787,5.1328,2.138,2.4251,7.0906,4.4886,1.0975,6.15,3.7075,4.9001,5.3427,2.4412,3.701,1.8468,3.9191,0.8651,5.4028,0.842,6.4223,5.2678,5.7853,0.9023,0.182,5.4764,2.2614,5.5811,1.9453,1.3664,6.7304,1.3224,4.6675,4.5975,5.184,0.3993,5.8118,1.4306,1.9662,3.8357,2.2403,1.7178,1.9541,1.272,1.0009,0.0006,5.3008,2.8589,6.7356,1.9278,3.2818,1.8351,6.8921,2.765,6.3581,4.7327,1.4024,0.9047,7.5728,1.6598,8.1746,4.7153,0.7115,9.7957,4.383,3.0109,4.7726,3.1248,4.7694,4.1793,1.3368,3.7345,0.8557,1.9788,2.7861,10.866,0.9038,0.3131,2.5856,7.0283,5.7416,3.0517,4.221,1.0324,5.9115,4.2095,3.351,2.4088,0.0047,5.8383,0.0007,14.2676,6.5312,0.6703,0.3555,0.0357,2.6266,4.1189,7.0843,0.8118,1.5997,1.5472,5.8737,4.2984,0.2379,2.2083,0.0022,3.3212,1.8773,3.3362,1.9912,3.4109,5.5351,0.9315,1.1367,2.27,1.1475,8.6006,3.7223,0.4516,0.5841,0.2,1.4151,0.0014,1.7984,5.2369,4.9096,1.2428,2.4883,3.9161,2.4837,2.2441,11.62,3.3497,0.4952,1.8037,4.2236,6.1645,2.0948,3.9594,1.7902,0.0025,2.6312,5.0327,4.276,1.0563,5.117,5.0948,2.0932,4.0677,1.4848,4.0853,4.6254,0.4633,10.4067,0.771,0.6704,3.3102,3.4389,0.2381,5.4184,8.1537,0.5091,1.8398,1.4376,1.1797,0.0068,0.5388,4.1866,0.0019,2.8003,2.2548,4.0883,1.7551,4.9901,3.5304,0.3644,1.2351,1.9904,4.3123,3.0473,0.4647,0.2312,0.0004,1.3992,4.0375,4.3672,3.1557,3.2965,0.3527,1.1504,3.4182,3.8501,1.6674,3.1328,4.2898,0.9937,0.1764,2.0782,0.0017,3.2186,0.9013,0.0009,4.6154,0.4139,1.1586,2.4567,2.8239,2.2905,2.2282,1.5536,0.0009,0.8303,2.0314,6.2467,4.7594,0.0468,4.919,1.107,11.1465,2.0953,0.2973,2.625,2.5961,0.002,5.5865,1.9792,5.6856,0.5189,0.6244,0.5561,0.5682,3.9352,2.8526,3.7259,0.0044,4.1911,1.1005,3.1367,0.8513,2.832,5.4511,2.9693,1.2828,2.0605,7.1734,0.7394,0.6284,2.1871,3.3717,0.7718,0.0087,2.0054,3.5884,2.9412,2.7384,2.7508,0.0433,3.1197,4.5453,4.4875,1.9386,0.1821,2.2872,2.4046,0.0052,5.7348,3.2334,2.8619,1.4959,1.065,0.5928,1.0588,3.8741,4.143,1.5006,2.7739,5.2264,4.1653,4.5382,4.1654,2.026,1.5083,1.6106,1.7729,1.0686,5.3377,1.0313,1.7695,3.1498,3.2181,0.2354,1.2943,4.2989,3.3114,0.0013,5.5521,0.3983,12.6291,6.3936,5.4512,0.0597,2.1377,5.682,5.6294,2.0791,1.8316,2.2141,4.4425,2.3463,4.3297,1.6845,5.7613,0.0817,1.3655,0.6609,4.0009,6.7418]}

The idea being that they have to come and undo what you have done in a period of time with your calculations so as to keep the same equations. So you would just have to keep making that equation till it works for a second, then make another, then another, you go round and try all the combinations of which you can and tell them what you have found. This would probably take some real calculation but they know you can make it and the best solution is pretty close to what you found originally.\nThe above should be fun to play with and I just wanted to bring it back as a bonus to this topic.

I am interested in the field of Psychology and Advertising, so I decided to pursue one of the most famous fields of Psychology: Psychology (the famous Professors, Prof. William McDaniel, Professor of Psychology at MIT as well as Harvard and Prof. Steven Pinker, Professor of psychology at UCLA, and a winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize in Economics).","token_len":375,"entropy":[5.5189,2.4348,3.7349,2.3207,12.1069,3.3294,2.9223,4.645,2.5272,4.3422,6.1105,5.3131,0.6837,2.1255,5.0168,0.157,4.8616,6.1391,8.2353,1.5179,1.1782,2.4394,7.7737,2.4536,3.4749,1.0034,4.9955,5.098,0.8279,5.1299,5.0063,7.5109,10.489,12.7621,7.0925,4.7404,3.2668,7.1661,10.5558,3.4635,6.0535,5.0598,4.8374,1.8724,2.8863,1.4302,5.1191,5.5104,3.8712,7.1664,3.8519,2.432,1.9115,3.5842,5.4072,1.6408,5.3381,1.5233,1.7832,3.0245,2.2858,3.6951,0.5081,4.2383,6.2954,5.9242,4.2869,5.3696,1.2357,3.1131,4.2897,1.8147,1.2754,3.865,1.2802,1.7473,5.406,2.7817,7.6512,1.1956,3.8088,6.3365,1.7961,0.3577,2.2504,2.2295,3.4916,4.016,1.5458,0.8831,3.3638,2.8832,5.0324,0.6258,3.5718,3.3682,2.1561,4.4122,3.0274,8.8435,2.0979,0.3476,1.7731,0.3128,3.6467,2.3203,6.667,0.0875,0.3889,5.096,2.6261,5.8478,4.4858,3.7252,0.3928,4.4078,1.7407,4.863,5.4472,1.336,3.3446,1.88,4.6635,3.3396,2.2117,0.2229,4.6928,4.7407,4.7484,2.9852,5.157,2.4749,4.6781,3.7727,4.3617,4.765,2.306,1.4839,4.3583,2.9136,2.4839,2.0071,2.439,1.0863,4.5845,4.5931,5.6665,0.3367,6.3001,5.0199,1.2025,2.6285,2.2647,5.7961,0.9625,1.6505,4.7553,6.4768,1.1277,1.1409,0.8213,0.8478,5.3604,0.7319,3.8083,3.2897,4.2312,2.1444,2.9069,6.7609,7.6723,4.156,5.1891,4.5612,3.0246,2.9611,2.8013,1.4349,2.6837,3.9392,4.9471,4.4638,1.0569,5.649,3.8725,0.9557,1.9029,0.5106,3.9151,6.8753,0.3631,0.8658,2.4455,6.7236,6.522,1.5276,5.736,1.4724,2.236,0.6171,1.9978,1.8471,5.2075,2.3062,0.0473,5.1601,1.0183,1.7302,4.7001,1.1941,4.1229,1.844,4.0767,4.7345,0.5217,6.2235,1.2872,6.1481,6.682,2.7048,1.3032,3.6928,0.0487,0.0502,6.899,4.4635,1.4489,0.1717,1.1553,6.0962,0.4959,0.0211,1.3237,0.4675,4.2616,0.1982,6.3165,1.831,4.6933,1.4947,3.9423,0.0636,6.1809,0.0347,0.0962,0.0015,0.9465,0.6791,5.0296,5.2158,0.8942,1.221,5.0702,3.0664,1.5864,0.4706,1.0248,0.0646,3.5188,1.2052,0.7908,3.5423,1.586,1.6184,5.9539,5.2291,2.1984,6.4496,3.7264,2.0497,1.7262,2.2446,1.6601,1.3159,0.227,2.6508,1.6154,6.8855,1.453,0.882,4.2156,2.5186,4.1626,1.1847,2.982,5.1197,3.5385,0.146,4.5945,1.061,2.4164,4.2037,3.2368,4.8305,2.2536,3.389,6.9958,6.1058,1.1788,4.1268,5.4536,0.6083,0.9851,2.4449,2.844,0.0337,2.2159,3.8971,0.1037,6.0531,1.3357,5.7913,2.1422,3.3433,0.5842,4.6168,0.0829,3.1056,5.8751,0.3683,0.7765,2.616,4.9703,3.0306,1.188,1.8468,1.9816,3.896,5.8973,3.8843,7.5368,8.7596,1.0295,3.66,2.9424,6.7777,5.4268,5.5691,5.9414,1.0316,2.8955,1.8156,1.3669,0.9247,4.3341,7.0148,0.1029,0.0661,5.6818,3.714,5.5661,0.379,4.8809,0.9068,0.0001,1.8043,2.4388,0.2977,4.9382,0.3094,4.1181,2.285,1.6315,3.3585,6.1657,0.2102,0.6289,6.4696,1.8219,3.7044,0.0135,2.2509,1.1625,1.0988]}

They drop their Ouija board and scream as they run to their bathroom and lock the door. `` I told you we shouldn't have touched it! '' you think to yourself.\nIn spite of your efforts, your phone rings. You pick it up and hear another voice. The one that tells you about demons.\nWell, you should go and see that demon right now. You know that there are others out there. You must go and scare them off.\nYou are afraid and your legs are a little wobbly, but you go to the bathroom door. You stand there and the room dims down and becomes black as you feel that something is pulling you deeper into those shadows. You don't know what to do. But just stay calm. Try not to scream. The room starts moving. The only thing you can hear is your own heart beating.\nSuddenly you are outside in the middle of a street, with another demon standing in front of you in a dark parking lot. The parking lot is empty. You have no idea where you are and you look around only to not find a single car. You can see the light from a building a little distance away but it is impossible to tell if the building is a car repair shop, a car show or the police station.\nThe demon is looking at you and in that instant you feel your stomach growl and you feel you can't breathe. You are too afraid to cry and just shake your head slightly in a gesture of resistance. You open your mouth and let out a low moan.\nThe demon's eyes change and he smiles at you. Your eyes are full of tears. You are in so much pain. Your hands are clenched, your face and body full of sweat.","token_len":376,"entropy":[7.9516,7.894,6.8579,3.322,4.3177,1.2159,3.7677,2.1939,2.2833,2.4967,4.7637,1.3232,2.3425,7.0771,0.0603,6.0221,0.0172,5.1881,9.9157,0.8961,3.2045,6.9159,2.8767,12.3183,0.0295,0.7935,0.9481,6.2047,4.029,0.7513,3.1794,3.279,3.3715,5.6197,2.4443,5.3946,0.6869,0.1834,0.6879,12.8146,7.9539,4.1774,0.5755,4.1204,5.5658,0.0042,2.1236,6.1631,2.5571,2.8048,4.0658,3.702,3.9221,1.4162,0.0396,0.4406,2.4629,6.2915,5.901,0.0123,2.5211,4.0261,0.7066,2.8043,5.5719,1.5668,0.9886,1.9712,5.444,0.8369,0.0131,0.7848,5.0185,4.7676,1.2271,1.6801,2.5352,2.7818,2.277,4.2848,0.0398,4.251,5.9434,1.2398,2.3262,6.3281,0.3056,2.2118,4.2319,3.9428,2.4088,2.2346,3.2327,3.1128,5.1417,0.7384,0.3572,2.2943,3.6467,2.127,3.6877,1.3399,5.0939,2.1326,0.0263,1.5609,1.8025,4.868,2.097,1.3428,7.9071,1.0752,2.0406,0.6047,1.7585,1.5929,3.2991,4.2995,4.3357,3.7866,6.7392,1.3533,5.5458,2.7092,5.6982,0.0565,0.0007,2.3784,0.7786,0.7976,4.3708,2.5505,1.1857,1.2854,5.0095,1.6502,1.2502,4.4207,0.5191,1.5559,3.3597,6.0779,6.2947,0.0988,4.5632,2.6148,6.4045,5.6092,3.6298,1.9496,5.3926,3.9402,2.9416,0.534,4.7785,0.6492,6.7978,1.0614,6.7682,3.3933,0.271,1.181,4.1304,0.0019,1.0172,0.5412,2.1085,0.1953,0.557,3.8235,5.394,5.5193,3.457,1.023,5.0697,1.3668,0.0031,3.3682,0.7962,3.692,3.9721,3.744,4.4908,1.624,2.3799,5.0271,0.9947,0.8066,0.4443,2.3537,0.3194,2.5804,2.4605,4.8098,1.484,0.9505,1.6318,4.2839,1.5241,2.0126,5.3615,2.9263,0.7819,2.364,0.0077,1.7073,3.7596,1.7127,3.5567,5.9624,1.4463,3.3478,1.7358,0.9081,0.0574,0.1078,4.2215,0.8228,2.8531,7.1675,0.2026,0.3003,2.0441,6.2921,0.1849,0.7197,3.0249,0.8189,1.081,3.5743,1.5361,0.5075,2.1194,1.5152,0.1903,3.0035,1.7382,4.0557,1.3978,6.6169,0.2656,7.1574,2.1056,2.2017,2.3071,3.9606,1.3173,1.0761,3.2903,1.9266,1.4683,5.5694,1.9144,2.3394,4.8059,5.0641,3.6376,3.5228,0.5496,3.0175,2.0596,0.9309,6.2531,0.1384,1.1783,2.155,1.7657,1.3786,0.1723,2.0794,3.3995,9.4685,0.2791,2.039,0.5275,4.2682,3.2693,1.7826,3.0978,3.8872,0.5678,0.1447,1.6763,1.9387,2.9854,1.9065,3.6343,1.0313,0.1093,1.9716,5.5851,4.076,1.0757,0.7501,2.2011,2.4463,4.5038,3.285,2.9953,1.3564,1.1456,2.5047,4.0623,2.9334,0.6005,1.7334,0.3219,0.9128,3.015,4.2268,2.9504,0.3801,4.6432,2.0403,4.3557,6.2052,0.3286,0.0256,7.1971,3.7416,3.6353,6.2839,0.5118,5.7346,0.2543,1.261,4.7791,0.5527,1.7043,0.8062,5.3058,0.3112,0.1345,4.2723,2.5784,1.0866,2.0552,1.523,0.8553,3.8855,1.3512,6.6342,3.2467,1.3079,4.775,1.2839,0.0275,0.6545,4.3868,2.1025,1.9915,3.5239,0.1051,2.4915,1.0351,1.3538,3.0099,3.8451,5.0696,0.1681,0.1975,3.2478,2.7962,3.3521,0.7012,4.542,3.0723,0.7647,2.0782,4.5465,2.6466,7.3119,0.0266,3.3665,0.3595]}

{"prompt":"A little girl dies and is accidentally sent to Hell to where the Demons do n't know what to do with her .","text":"A little girl dies and is accidentally sent to Hell to where the Demons don't know what to do with her. I mean, really... Hell is a mess that has to be cleaned up.\nThat is a nice take...maybe it's the curse, but I'm not sure. A little girl dies and is sent to Hell? Is any of that really a thing anymore?\nI hope you find an interesting answer. It's an interesting subject. We are all pretty fortunate in this regard.\ni like this concept... if she falls for Satan i dont see why they can do not know what to do cause all hell is not made out of witches and demons... i have always thought that they just do not care about innocent people and think its fun to torture them while looking pretty\nHell is a place for those who have died in sin! We are all sinners, and I would think a little sin would have the Devil going \"BINGO! I can finally get the girl in the corner.\"\nI think the idea is if you were a saint you would go to heaven. If you were a demon or a witch you would go to hell. I also think it depends if it was innocent or not. Like the child, in a way, was innocent. But if she did something bad, I don't think they could go back and just leave her there. That would be too easy.\ni could have a whole thread on the devil with his name being debated and just everything about him...i'd have to make it interesting.\ni had an idea, i have heard that hell is a place for people to go where they stay in it forever and is full of all your memories, from the ones you are having with family and your friends right up till they were last breaths left. then they are thrown into a fire and destroyed.","token_len":376,"entropy":[7.4262,4.5543,8.3207,2.5673,3.1806,6.462,4.3967,0.5142,5.0904,3.5419,9.5152,2.2744,8.0498,6.0484,0.2331,3.2004,1.9672,1.2812,0.0455,0.5412,0.1252,0.5873,4.8773,3.8367,0.4475,4.6395,4.2548,5.052,1.7385,1.6228,6.762,5.4088,3.633,1.5005,0.2587,2.2648,0.2022,1.088,1.784,8.3576,3.2372,2.7554,4.3053,5.3741,5.6942,6.6075,2.3705,1.3457,3.149,6.9697,2.871,1.5436,1.5033,1.8836,1.1146,0.5159,0.7344,5.494,2.7476,0.3698,1.1756,0.1366,0.0683,6.1162,0.0071,0.0075,8.0883,3.8872,7.025,0.6224,1.3228,2.5964,2.0167,3.5988,4.7082,0.3265,1.1776,2.2775,3.9003,2.3154,3.5513,6.0846,3.6644,3.0201,1.2528,3.9715,0.9001,4.1081,0.8,4.2044,1.3311,5.4548,3.3504,2.3618,4.9083,6.1507,2.4954,1.7389,3.9367,0.6332,1.1032,8.8543,4.73,2.2772,5.9065,3.5863,4.9353,4.4993,6.3942,3.4061,5.5666,6.7262,5.9758,3.2408,1.2921,3.7549,2.582,4.5324,6.3283,4.02,1.3234,0.647,0.0148,8.9815,4.9203,3.4782,1.5399,4.2911,5.6003,3.1575,0.057,9.5558,1.8123,1.6812,2.5389,3.2944,4.286,3.9588,2.0812,1.2107,3.7031,4.5265,3.6752,0.7816,2.2081,0.858,7.6911,0.7452,2.0334,5.789,5.933,5.152,1.3559,6.0118,0.708,4.9783,6.0578,5.8127,5.6737,6.8759,0.818,1.1725,2.5147,4.3827,4.0866,0.7706,2.6294,4.8024,2.3759,6.2573,6.3643,4.0565,1.4694,0.9981,1.4555,2.1009,2.2243,4.5429,3.368,4.28,4.8937,2.2264,7.6168,1.6961,3.4748,4.1299,6.3886,5.2202,6.0309,5.1084,5.3678,0.6122,2.8895,2.7546,3.8578,6.8774,2.412,3.6468,5.1988,3.9882,2.9047,5.2178,3.6054,1.0602,2.2459,2.4098,2.3453,3.3742,1.7566,6.8244,1.1388,4.0991,2.1965,6.0414,1.6735,0.482,3.7331,1.3416,3.7803,2.3173,2.6562,0.3475,0.792,0.3561,3.1126,3.2026,0.9334,2.3226,0.8738,0.1839,0.8673,0.3486,0.1956,0.4138,2.2843,4.815,0.5125,2.035,7.3563,3.441,3.4833,1.7944,8.4692,0.7648,0.8864,0.454,6.3789,3.2176,6.1755,3.0464,4.8706,2.7206,2.2369,1.5938,5.0441,5.1462,1.2024,2.9834,2.0257,2.0555,3.7797,3.0857,2.3949,1.402,3.6491,2.462,0.0018,0.4301,2.9723,3.0746,3.6817,3.0426,1.999,5.5816,4.6663,0.5383,1.5785,0.8124,3.6519,1.6276,0.6071,3.8849,3.9233,0.776,0.8475,5.1006,5.3567,3.2509,2.9971,5.4646,5.9863,1.8668,2.1597,3.7142,5.0164,4.2425,2.9439,3.9904,8.8336,2.3467,5.3034,7.7028,3.8868,1.6154,4.5062,6.413,3.9837,2.9713,0.9241,4.2055,2.0949,5.1305,0.9906,0.8715,3.2278,5.4386,3.4369,0.9345,3.5548,3.5195,4.4105,4.8275,2.2951,6.0414,0.5323,1.0786,0.6468,1.0577,2.2886,2.6961,2.6314,3.833,0.6726,6.843,3.355,5.6181,5.8281,1.9774,6.1192,4.4916,0.0315,3.9971,6.9559,5.4585,2.1688,5.9608,2.0541,5.7851,0.8279,3.2101,5.0535,2.6813,5.6622,1.0952,5.5692,0.8252,7.3235,3.0498,3.3398,2.8048,6.5491,7.3999,12.6812,5.6038,1.1182,5.4643,2.5141,2.8026,4.8973,1.0931,2.0911,4.9371,1.3111,6.0772,1.0209]}
{"prompt":"A man cheats death . So death writes him a notice , on him breaking the contract agreement of life and death .","text":"A man cheats death. So death writes him a notice, on him breaking the contract agreement of life and death. He commits suicide to save himself from life\u2019s misery. The man comes to life again but with no memories he dies, but a new one.\nForget the original. Here you have the best. Even for a brief period, the old man\u2019s head seems to be the part of him that he had left while he was dying. It is a head belonging to a body which had no life, a body that had lost its brain. The idea of his brain coming from somewhere else or being from somewhere other than his self brings to mind the classic story of the body that cried out for a brain, the body that never had a will to live, the body that only had a self to die. This is how death becomes a new one, a new man, while death itself is not so much as humanly possible. The man doesn\u2019t have the knowledge he needs to have a new life, and his desire to be is such that if he is left alone he will do anything and nothing at all to be. The idea is that a head exists and still, the body that can only be called the corpse cannot recognize that it is a head. This head has the memories that all the world gave it and the desire to feel its life, its brain is connected to so many other parts of the body that are already no longer a part of its life. The body is made of matter that belongs to life and death it is only a body, and what it has are memories of itself from the past. But now it is itself that doesn\u2019t belong to it, a man who\u2019s alive in its own memories and desires because it is dead and without any hope of ever returning to life.","token_len":376,"entropy":[7.3022,9.7332,1.3029,8.539,3.3849,5.3,7.498,10.66,2.7494,1.5977,5.8988,2.4986,5.6911,6.4831,9.8742,1.1925,6.3829,9.3214,4.4087,5.3135,1.8772,0.7503,1.0786,2.6167,5.1967,0.4634,4.9302,2.947,2.0481,1.3898,5.2301,15.0419,7.5875,6.3756,4.9615,0.6102,2.901,2.5169,5.9361,0.9444,4.0133,3.1348,4.3595,3.5337,2.79,5.3885,6.235,4.0235,2.6921,3.4526,4.3808,2.6622,1.937,1.9732,1.9306,7.0906,4.8436,1.6472,5.6375,2.8515,5.4229,4.4132,0.924,1.4818,5.5049,5.1208,5.9725,4.2361,1.8314,6.2323,1.8147,1.9436,1.8888,5.2093,1.3043,10.157,0.6967,0.1638,6.7208,4.9576,0.4103,1.2671,4.0895,6.6838,0.7054,2.4453,0.7483,4.6283,4.0164,3.7482,6.1951,1.0483,0.4563,4.1423,0.4933,3.0729,1.2398,2.4727,4.3448,8.5014,0.0568,1.6336,5.914,3.4824,3.0629,4.226,3.5723,1.7872,3.6545,1.1139,1.5301,1.2637,3.9187,1.1636,5.9834,1.4999,2.1093,5.7243,0.9639,4.113,3.593,5.0657,4.2217,5.383,1.684,4.5508,3.0625,3.4891,1.6195,2.5931,0.2626,1.0746,6.8437,7.9319,1.8515,0.086,1.0146,5.7264,3.3814,0.235,1.4137,6.0529,2.8296,8.9182,0.4958,0.6591,1.9916,4.8741,2.0242,2.9621,1.1923,0.301,4.9737,2.4304,0.7622,6.9662,1.6277,1.2126,1.7372,1.0686,0.4332,0.2015,4.6493,1.6129,1.1721,4.5582,2.7141,2.339,0.4639,3.1012,1.1907,2.8711,3.608,4.5371,1.7152,4.6347,3.6442,1.8729,1.2065,0.6773,3.8945,1.7415,7.0245,3.4941,3.9454,0.8246,3.912,3.1999,1.1533,4.8755,6.0744,2.4841,0.9276,0.4927,2.4779,3.0488,5.3145,2.5509,0.3347,0.1004,2.0954,2.0212,5.4429,4.5664,1.4547,0.3184,4.3832,0.8329,1.8928,0.7093,1.1424,2.4316,3.2509,5.6272,0.7252,2.7804,5.6376,5.6442,0.1137,4.1859,0.3219,2.8224,4.9007,2.3431,1.5574,1.5966,4.5261,1.7059,3.2171,3.0568,3.8199,0.3478,0.8298,3.654,6.8223,2.3014,3.5522,2.784,0.9268,3.7832,5.3159,5.9602,2.75,7.1631,5.2539,3.7157,1.92,1.7862,4.6016,2.6852,2.1117,4.8307,2.7039,5.2617,5.6534,8.1913,3.3411,0.9914,0.8372,2.0258,1.6762,0.5878,2.5766,4.3022,3.23,2.9557,5.1143,2.4716,5.1368,1.7946,4.2158,7.4235,0.6865,1.9987,1.8413,4.6518,0.3173,5.5665,3.7199,5.1802,2.2223,2.6278,8.2395,3.9752,6.4443,0.4781,7.0791,0.6069,1.262,2.0058,1.0194,0.6767,0.3102,0.5218,4.0424,5.333,6.7329,0.3944,4.3706,1.0118,0.0454,3.6243,3.5253,0.5287,1.6092,1.9012,1.8164,4.3998,1.4362,5.0987,2.8519,5.3909,0.1771,4.4187,1.4414,1.4504,5.9764,0.8773,4.331,1.6596,2.76,2.3909,2.1373,5.1056,1.6824,1.9342,5.7021,2.2724,1.8279,3.7357,5.5765,1.5402,1.3872,0.747,4.0275,4.952,2.3146,0.5559,8.4694,3.151,6.2313,0.052,0.0226,0.0085,2.6844,0.3173,3.2862,1.5203,3.8559,4.6646,1.827,8.6806,0.0329,0.0238,4.426,4.0118,4.0344,0.987,6.9562,2.0012,5.165,5.5032,1.5843,0.8728,3.2553,2.1646,4.9828,2.5366,3.8803,0.7776,2.6879,3.0341,0.9931,1.0551,0.3717]}

Describe their shenanigans of adventure, internal rivalries, and misuse of gratuitous amounts of abandoned office furniture. Also explain how such activities are destructive to a company's reputation.\nA company called A has been engaged to replace the office lighting in a five -story building. The lighting requirements included a high -intensity discharge light fixture. Four of A's clients objected to installing that fixture in the lobby which is the entranceway to all the offices. The problem was solved by installing dimming switches on all the offices. What was the company's response to the complaints that the light fixtures would not accommodate the office lighting requirements?\nOn our campus, we have a library with two floors and a stairway up from the ground floor to the first floor. There is a lift connecting the libraries but it is not working from Monday to Friday. When the lift worked, it could not accommodate enough students. The students usually went to the library by stairs or by elevators. However, if students wanted to go to other buildings by elevators, they would have to wait for the lift. What was the solution to this problem by the library?\nA friend came over and explained to me a situation in a department store. There is a computer lab on the first floor and there is a security guard in the computer lab but no one in the lobby or security guard. In the morning, a student goes to the computer lab for a class, he would ask for the security guard in the computer lab, the security guard will say that is not necessary. One morning, my friend came back from the lab, he found the security guard had gone. He went to the computer lab and went inside the computer lab and did not find the security guard there and he also would not answer his door.","token_len":376,"entropy":[8.7058,9.4549,1.869,3.7319,8.323,4.1749,6.1945,0.0663,0.87,8.7149,4.8455,5.4854,2.098,2.0421,2.6689,2.1285,0.6341,11.102,3.8111,4.776,12.827,5.8877,10.0635,1.8765,9.6456,7.1439,0.0083,0.5592,1.2726,9.9004,0.0607,11.125,0.932,6.7535,0.0466,11.7312,6.266,2.8722,0.5413,4.8404,3.3868,1.4891,6.8408,5.82,1.4488,8.4888,0.6005,3.6341,2.8345,0.7832,1.5764,1.0621,1.347,8.5935,4.3682,5.2199,4.8875,8.7518,1.858,6.2128,2.8635,6.1479,1.7113,4.2511,8.4464,2.7008,2.165,6.9043,8.3424,2.6466,0.7043,1.717,2.0161,4.852,7.2537,6.472,2.1207,4.4129,7.2318,3.5405,6.4141,4.8541,3.7088,2.2691,7.5016,2.3068,3.4142,0.0246,6.1159,6.7302,0.3135,4.5031,3.6223,0.6307,2.4929,0.6742,6.4708,5.5783,2.7175,3.6596,6.3633,5.5034,0.3606,5.3062,1.2983,1.6665,0.7103,1.7836,5.1206,0.9333,4.05,1.0061,1.7705,8.0844,2.0319,4.29,1.9086,2.369,0.8973,3.4699,0.9428,5.5068,2.9217,1.4439,5.0941,0.6131,2.2212,1.678,0.9915,3.5352,3.9378,1.5509,2.9656,1.0059,3.6918,2.0367,8.0646,1.1495,2.5902,2.2592,1.141,0.304,1.4532,5.3311,6.2504,6.0732,0.7773,1.7478,1.3952,1.4282,5.0267,2.7471,3.9215,3.6548,2.2306,1.1213,5.2674,1.4258,4.7676,4.4415,0.4285,4.7567,0.2792,3.1084,0.5156,4.4491,0.152,0.5809,3.3892,1.1059,0.8396,8.5168,6.201,0.6431,5.0157,5.6624,1.9034,0.7728,1.7349,4.3352,7.0597,9.6501,0.9889,0.7548,0.3737,3.5751,1.9047,1.7669,8.6907,0.9656,1.9841,4.4636,0.3769,2.3086,6.413,4.2606,1.6914,1.9628,3.5312,7.86,3.286,0.5191,0.8499,0.6535,5.3558,6.6158,3.0073,2.0633,2.9518,0.006,0.9544,5.0859,0.087,4.028,3.675,4.2475,0.1739,0.8909,0.9289,4.9591,2.6429,4.721,0.8475,0.0343,0.5935,0.6981,1.5574,0.6997,0.0683,3.2699,1.8012,1.1684,1.0105,2.5901,4.7094,2.021,0.3122,2.2836,1.1308,1.0291,0.3171,5.1676,2.667,2.9704,0.7459,1.4405,2.5085,5.7167,5.3295,2.8066,1.5048,3.4641,1.6209,1.0588,4.5466,3.8797,2.264,4.1342,4.8876,0.4783,0.9791,3.5169,2.361,0.4138,5.647,2.45,2.4918,0.7756,2.4598,0.0199,1.9037,1.6918,0.6576,0.4591,6.3659,1.5418,2.3014,0.5611,5.3267,0.1927,5.2558,2.9355,0.8045,3.3474,0.2885,6.5768,3.4694,5.5933,2.3924,1.5301,3.7462,0.8004,5.5665,0.6636,2.8914,3.7081,4.3727,0.4141,0.4607,0.878,0.0752,3.6706,1.4799,4.2286,2.9164,3.6465,5.0846,5.1612,1.7646,1.7326,1.7873,0.2238,4.0104,0.1943,1.465,0.0353,2.3222,2.887,0.465,0.0388,3.9448,2.6169,2.5855,5.1369,1.5431,2.4271,1.4722,4.991,5.1385,0.4053,6.0344,0.7433,2.6384,2.669,1.4847,1.5702,2.6215,2.1151,0.8901,4.265,1.5932,0.251,0.0582,2.9137,2.7035,3.1423,1.3706,3.3742,0.6585,0.3779,1.3604,0.0712,1.0085,5.1351,4.7519,1.4755,1.2588,0.145,1.9691,4.2856,0.5686,1.1468,0.6376,0.0808,0.0159,3.5286,4.3433,2.0523,4.652,6.7263,0.2002,4.1973,1.6863,4.262,0.5745]}

But your frustration turns to rage because everyone else is having so much fun while you\u2019re stuck in the cold! So you throw yourself at the keyboard and begin to respond to some serious challenges. Soon you wind up back at the very beginning of this post only to find you have written four blog posts instead of one. It\u2019s tough, but there is hope.\nFirst, take a breath. Write your blog post. Don\u2019t sweat over it. Then move on and do something else. Make a crafty card. Send one picture to a friend.\nWhat if I tell you that you have written a blog post every day for the past month? Not necessarily in that order but you\u2019re still ahead of 85% of the blogging population. We\u2019ll all just take a moment to applaud you.\nOf course, I\u2019ve made fun of other bloggers but most bloggers are not like me.

Bodies are in a state of suspended animation in their homes, only the eyes and breaths can be felt in such circumstances.\n2. They are afraid of going out because of lockdown, the fear of getting infected in quarantine and the fear of passing it on to the people around them.\n3. It is the middle of winter and the temperature is dropping steadily. The heat pads, sleeping pills and sweaters have become daily necessities for some.\n4. No one is allowed to come out of their home except for medical emergencies. We know how important doctors and nurses are in the fight against the Corona Pandemic, so the government has made them frontline workers whose families do not receive a single salary from these doctors and nurse.\n6. They have no choice but to stay put, they cannot go outside without permission. The police has stopped the movement of the people from their homes.\n7. The government has taken all the necessary precautions to contain the outbreak, but nobody is sure how many dead bodies lie under the rubble.\n8.

{"prompt":"Write a sex scene entirely in silly euphemisms .","text":"Write a sex scene entirely in silly euphemisms.\"\nThat's the type of stuff I don't read to find out how good something is. I don't read it to find out whether the story is interesting or funny, that kind of stuff is obvious from the title and the synopsis, and even if they were interesting (or funny) I wouldn't read that to find out how it was written because it might be a little difficult to convey that with half of your sentences missing.\nWhat I read is more like the synopsis tells me that the story will be interesting and that I am interested in reading it, and the book tells me if it actually is. If you make up a lot of things to get the story to fit what is supposed to be interesting and the book never sounds interesting in the first place, then I think it's kind of cheesy\/boring.\nAnd if you're looking to change my views on things then I think that would be the wrong place to do that.\nI can't even imagine what a plot like that would have to be to grab your attention enough. If it's a silly sexual fantasy, you can make it an interesting plot if that involves some sort of plot twist that is going to make you question everything you know.\nIf the plot is simple and all the sexual content is easy to forget, then I think you really need to do more to make it interesting, but the whole book sounds kind of silly. If it starts out as a joke about gay men doing strange things which aren't particularly sexist, and it becomes something more serious and there is a character who's been a jerk but now turns out to be good, then that is a plot twist that is going to change everything. I think you could do that if you've got two characters whose relationship you like but where one turns out to be a jerk.","token_len":377,"entropy":[4.0641,10.2912,4.2902,9.6195,1.6698,11.2248,7.5833,0.2012,5.5586,0.6429,10.5871,0.9248,2.4209,5.0288,0.0033,3.8643,2.087,4.8026,0.0008,4.3838,5.4638,5.5964,1.4473,2.2591,5.1364,6.3194,0.3581,0.79,1.8396,2.3176,0.0004,1.8844,2.6031,0.7972,1.2141,0.0236,3.7277,2.9732,4.1389,0.571,4.1138,0.4899,3.4864,1.7429,4.9674,6.1498,0.0016,1.5602,3.2633,6.4662,4.1939,0.659,3.0418,2.9723,1.5507,4.6978,1.8851,1.4943,4.2455,1.2042,3.6959,2.8815,5.5324,4.7489,2.807,2.1122,0.9519,1.5401,1.9501,0.0005,2.4097,3.2816,2.4707,0.6464,0.0279,1.6564,2.5236,1.7341,3.3055,5.4335,1.5931,3.6201,1.3626,2.2289,2.4537,5.5304,0.2879,5.319,3.0457,5.1976,7.6537,2.0791,4.0494,7.0096,5.3111,0.9432,0.8776,4.1221,1.1817,3.1306,2.2034,4.4353,1.7443,2.8779,5.1985,10.6423,1.0771,1.9113,1.4254,1.4439,3.1285,1.2207,2.5106,1.8707,2.0036,2.032,3.4903,3.2262,0.3277,3.3795,0.9885,2.075,1.6435,3.3779,4.0996,4.3037,0.1324,5.3865,1.7693,6.4349,1.5595,2.2571,3.1341,2.1601,6.1656,4.1207,1.3758,2.9685,0.0294,3.1856,2.419,3.4968,2.6607,1.0452,2.4468,3.7309,3.7513,3.2094,4.6191,0.0032,0.0975,2.0893,1.8484,3.6606,3.0501,7.4552,7.0849,1.9394,4.1686,1.1275,0.4701,0.0129,0.5765,1.3649,2.1275,2.3018,1.7498,0.9132,4.971,0.001,6.9747,7.3953,4.2812,0.0142,1.3748,1.0038,3.6043,2.643,0.75,1.9199,3.4476,2.0888,5.5284,4.1243,5.228,0.7241,3.5773,5.6083,1.2032,2.0448,1.9752,3.4955,0.1527,3.3289,4.3142,3.3204,0.2067,1.945,2.6986,0.3668,1.2964,2.019,4.1456,0.9434,3.7198,2.6512,2.1103,2.2787,6.2401,3.2683,0.8844,0.6254,2.5778,1.2585,0.7741,2.2127,8.7533,2.783,0.3743,6.9188,2.8828,3.2246,2.5521,1.1953,2.0332,5.9844,5.8182,3.1632,2.3806,3.3789,2.3755,4.1848,0.9374,5.2474,1.5109,3.7884,3.1277,3.2566,8.2141,3.3569,1.9121,0.0016,3.7094,2.267,2.2814,2.683,3.6935,0.1513,1.7667,0.8872,5.3648,3.2224,0.7819,2.5763,2.4248,1.3005,2.8584,2.7481,2.7911,1.2843,5.1188,1.3571,4.5026,2.0768,5.6204,3.2946,0.414,5.4393,0.4473,6.7566,1.2366,0.3779,1.5132,0.8818,1.9705,4.9215,1.5926,0.1102,3.998,2.8565,2.5073,2.1659,0.8054,1.7636,2.7382,3.1411,3.799,5.2584,4.49,5.704,3.9858,0.0023,1.7717,1.7197,2.6787,1.3272,5.7508,1.6294,1.9712,0.7737,2.8244,2.9093,6.458,1.8769,4.4004,5.8915,0.2128,6.1524,5.1323,0.0002,4.0212,8.1756,1.2629,3.2662,2.7422,4.3023,3.154,1.9027,2.8392,1.2599,6.5116,1.2665,1.3739,5.2409,1.4389,3.6157,5.1569,4.2959,4.0542,5.0581,4.1617,4.8156,0.3394,0.2422,0.1489,5.3048,2.3251,0.256,2.1891,2.8891,1.8409,3.0268,0.8733,1.3832,1.6121,1.5682,0.0081,5.1099,2.5797,0.7277,2.805,1.3185,2.0325,3.3645,1.8152,1.1786,3.2427,0.3482,5.1178,1.3369,6.1528,2.4183,5.4901,4.138,4.9053,3.8277,3.137,5.4791,4.6541,6.4024,0.1156,0.0653,0.0893,1.7764,1.8889,2.6001]}
{"prompt":"Scientists have confirmed that Earth is the only planet in the Universe with life on it .","text":"Scientists have confirmed that Earth is the only planet in the Universe with life on it. They also affirmed that Earth is indeed a blue-white ball. This hypothesis was made on the basis of the fact that life is a very complex, energetic system. This is a chemical reaction that occurs in a living cell, which is a collection of microorganisms. This metabolic system requires the presence of hydrogen and other inorganic compounds called essentials, as well as essentials minerals. These are the so-called trace elements as phosphorus, zinc, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, sodium and potassium.\nThere are so many elements that are not found in the earth, and, therefore, in the cell, but the human body needs them in order to be able to survive. Many of which have specific functions to perform or, rather, have a very important role in the functioning of the body. These are called micronutrients.\nThere are essential and non-essential micronutrients. The essential ones are essential elements that are used in our body for the synthesis of proteins (amino acids) which are responsible for the building of our cells, and for the synthesis of membranes. These are needed in very small quantities.\nThe non-essential micronutrients that we will talk about are very well known. They include, among others, vitamins, minerals, trace elements and also trace organic compounds such as flavonoids.\nSo how do we know if we need to eat micronutrients? Well, the following situations can arise in a person who is not eating enough of these nutrients.\nThis is where the need for a nutritional supplement can arise, and in this case, it is important that the person consults with a nutritionist, since he\/she will be able to create a complete and personalized dietary plan, according to what is needed.","token_len":377,"entropy":[3.8359,4.601,0.594,7.4242,1.8634,3.7679,2.4128,1.5831,1.6972,0.1981,4.0483,1.3314,4.0411,2.6302,0.6377,0.789,3.2699,2.2827,9.3164,0.2978,2.8601,1.0139,4.7086,1.8681,7.4895,2.3407,2.5651,6.7314,2.0938,3.7294,6.1864,1.8865,4.5274,4.5647,1.0527,0.4312,0.3162,1.636,1.7049,0.0166,3.9861,2.2068,3.2843,2.9714,2.144,2.7846,5.3837,3.2347,1.3852,3.676,1.9301,2.6355,8.0644,2.0202,1.2701,2.0781,1.4828,2.486,5.871,2.4945,1.8185,2.4738,1.3362,2.6803,7.6629,0.0106,5.4892,0.3029,1.421,3.0236,7.2382,2.2236,4.9139,2.9016,2.3767,0.0416,4.3935,1.292,4.4716,7.1396,0.0105,1.7712,4.6094,13.365,1.819,4.4446,0.3575,0.0074,12.0658,7.1931,1.248,2.3189,2.8246,1.9436,6.8074,0.3208,0.0006,9.6093,0.1001,6.4509,11.2118,0.506,3.777,0.244,3.5072,0.2727,2.1158,0.2522,1.9499,0.2606,2.1448,0.0002,0.0001,0.2105,5.0524,1.9245,1.4423,0.2256,2.0161,9.7955,0.6002,4.8771,0.3037,2.7845,1.5143,1.9786,3.0284,1.6377,0.4189,1.2061,3.2208,1.752,2.1361,5.8312,2.3022,0.015,4.5138,1.0767,7.4376,1.1904,3.1451,3.1784,6.4789,0.4176,4.7307,1.6457,3.3994,0.1503,0.0476,3.6138,1.1552,0.0082,2.1485,0.7017,5.5632,0.9261,6.2433,2.5505,6.3591,2.1753,3.8621,5.8852,5.3634,5.2924,4.4482,0.141,4.0834,2.4484,4.1808,2.5039,0.5569,0.3925,1.121,2.8918,0.0367,0.4026,0.7222,0.3283,2.5582,2.1168,1.4642,7.2279,0.1801,0.256,0.0146,0.8432,1.5515,3.6051,0.3397,6.7659,3.6702,3.6214,4.7055,0.0003,2.7732,0.0121,0.0003,0.0186,1.7963,2.3223,1.2631,2.8609,0.4678,4.2426,5.9479,2.4704,1.132,3.29,0.9708,3.7289,2.6261,2.6618,1.9805,4.639,0.3123,2.8121,4.6961,5.8485,1.1534,0.044,1.4802,4.3807,0.8564,4.5335,0.0161,1.0861,3.3926,0.7317,2.5381,1.0236,1.7008,1.6894,1.75,1.126,2.4635,0.0443,6.984,1.2237,1.5181,1.0931,4.8267,1.8547,6.5735,3.6759,0.826,2.4545,1.7613,1.8052,0.6088,1.0033,0.0007,2.7457,0.0034,0.0011,0.0263,3.2887,1.4179,5.4162,2.8144,0.0092,1.4195,6.4889,6.5453,0.4926,1.0777,1.6833,1.9778,2.8323,2.924,0.4167,0.1776,3.714,1.2267,0.3935,0.2615,4.8174,0.2796,2.3086,5.559,3.568,4.2392,0.3873,2.6459,0.0027,6.7499,0.0416,0.0293,1.2105,1.0843,4.144,4.0591,0.9351,0.6643,1.4334,2.8605,1.3271,3.6945,1.9047,2.2825,7.0281,0.0107,0.005,0.0161,0.8014,1.8645,0.0752,2.3982,5.2885,7.7075,2.3875,4.2668,2.6618,2.5423,2.378,2.0205,0.8445,1.9653,2.3217,3.1328,2.8015,0.8856,2.4385,0.6971,0.9109,4.5502,1.3388,2.8632,1.2275,4.2856,0.5305,3.0193,4.545,0.8488,3.844,0.8827,3.1604,1.8233,3.6893,2.3626,0.3091,0.6354,2.3505,0.9758,2.897,1.8032,1.8746,0.722,7.1631,5.2201,1.1083,0.9572,1.596,0.121,2.8394,5.1875,4.494,2.4448,0.0013,1.5741,1.4111,0.6204,0.0069,6.0144,0.7473,4.8324,2.9343,5.9602,3.0675,0.2936,3.4121,5.4274,0.0055,2.9029,1.654,3.5101,1.0156]}

Oh, but I can\u2019t see how that will happen...\nSprinkles of Gold was first published in 1994 and has been the recipient of 10 Shamus Awards and two Edgar Awards. The novel was adapted as a motion picture starring Goldie Hawn, Whoopi Goldberg, and Catherine O?\u201dHara, and written by David Wain. (The movie was named one of the most disappointing movies of all time.)\nAfter I finished reading The Other Gretta, I had to read Sprinkles of Gold. I loved the way the two books are intertwined and how she creates characters so real. The story is so moving. If you are a fan of Gillian Flynn or Patricia Highsmith, and you are looking for the best of the best in crime fiction, then go grab a copy of The Other Gretta now!\nGillian Flynn's \"The Other Gretta\" is a riveting read.

{"prompt":"you are sent to hell after death . But it is just Dell customer service hold music for eternity ... ...","text":"you are sent to hell after death. But it is just Dell customer service hold music for eternity...... I do not know many people who know how to use it. But after watching this video i decided to learn and i do not need to spend one penny on music subscription. But it is just a question of knowing where to find your stuff. And thank you thank you\nYes, the people who are working there are really nice. They are all human beings, that want to help people.\nIn this article I am saying that I did everything by myself... and I went there to register on the internet, and I did not care at the first time in the second time the third time or fourth time I also did a lot of work. But I made everything by myself.\nYou can also contact Dell support or any online support and say that you have the video and you want to get an answer, as I told you Dell does not care.\nI think it is also good to make a Dell video... because I think it is also important if I have a Dell video, which I make because this is one of the things that you can say Dell, why don't you have music support or why do you have so many problems with the video and the problem is not the support\nFor everyone who does not know, I have a Dell product, but I do not have a subscription, I have used the service in my house for about six years, and nothing has happened to me.

{"prompt":"A confrontation set during a thunderstorm .","text":"A confrontation set during a thunderstorm. I had never heard of it until you blogged about it. In our culture where we seem to prefer violence over all other forms of expression, you are doing something right to call the reality as it is.\nThanks for this insight. I always thought there had to be someone inside the mind of the perpetrator that was affected by the trauma, somehow, but didn\u2019t know how. It\u2019s interesting to know that the opposite could be true as well. Either way, the story is powerful and it raises questions to ponder.\nThanks so much for sharing this. I find myself wondering about what exactly the other half of this equation is. Like what is the cause of some of those behaviors? Is there some unconscious reaction that has to do with trauma I don\u2019t even know about? And is there such a thing as a double trauma after all, one that can amplify the other? My understanding of trauma is more focused on being a person who can handle traumatic things, and not a person who gets too anxious and can\u2019t live in this condition and thus needs to get over it somehow, and this is why I don\u2019t understand a lot of the behavior of people who can deal with a lot of life stressors and never really suffer from trauma. They appear to do, but there are others that don\u2019t. For me, the difference comes in the difference between coping and recovering. I\u2019ve tried many times to get the feeling of a different life, and it never seems to work.

Write about the one that got away and changed history as we know it now. As a policeman in the city, you must stop the evil criminals from committing heinous crimes. The idea behind the game is quite simple to play. In order to earn points by arresting criminals, you have to make your character walk a tight rope between not offending time travelers and making the player lose points.\nSo, how do people get hired? Well, you need to show the right behavior when you walk down the Street. The company employs people who are well behaved.\nSo how do you make a point to get into a great job? You can spend an extra point at the beginning of the game to earn points while you are walking down the Street. The harder the crime you find the more points you will earn.\nThis game is very enjoyable if not too challenging. The graphics are so simple but still have a lot to offer. The characters are very simple and easy to recognize. The game uses a timer which means you have to make your character walk, eat his food and drink. There's no way to use a gun!\nYou can change the map to various parts of the United States, from the South to the East Coast. You can choose from different buildings to see how the police works.\nMost of the graphics are designed in the same style as the game Police Academy. Which is the same coloration. This game is a little bit on the expensive side for being only $7.99.\nIt's very easy to see that this is a game that has been made with a little bit of love and will definitely give a different type of experience for players. However, if you are an experienced video game player and you think you can play the game, then it might be worth it to read further about the game.","token_len":385,"entropy":[5.2847,2.8428,6.3747,11.6818,8.8937,3.0594,1.6634,5.7948,9.2032,0.0016,6.7548,9.3429,7.8457,2.6009,3.457,0.9975,8.9327,3.8299,2.644,7.7162,4.3326,3.6938,3.8763,2.5561,7.4176,4.0871,5.047,2.6212,1.3999,0.0081,5.0377,0.6036,6.0839,1.4696,7.727,3.0839,1.5797,4.5229,1.6165,0.8642,3.5804,6.5027,2.1483,5.2964,6.9193,1.9068,5.4829,4.2809,0.1373,0.9769,3.7239,6.2762,2.9641,1.8951,7.0236,0.2665,7.2047,0.1021,5.4786,1.0803,1.1043,3.8906,1.8038,0.0728,4.9699,1.9085,3.77,7.2874,1.6324,0.557,0.3662,2.4694,0.0322,3.9529,3.0736,5.8889,3.8938,3.7849,4.1368,3.4332,4.789,8.0699,7.4221,5.734,1.1255,1.2538,4.4062,2.7251,5.5426,4.6148,2.6659,0.6191,2.0959,8.8746,1.3625,2.8266,0.8107,6.2262,1.9108,8.6111,2.0318,2.5254,0.1211,1.9155,2.7268,0.3979,5.1031,2.7779,6.04,5.833,3.982,0.8326,4.6625,3.6955,0.3986,7.3806,1.1268,2.9649,7.2228,7.7044,2.9865,0.8511,1.2261,4.2837,3.7396,2.1781,4.0235,2.9586,2.9074,0.4655,0.5837,2.8596,2.1734,5.4705,3.5354,2.5353,5.8788,1.906,7.0539,2.664,0.7444,2.6251,2.2691,4.8015,3.6562,2.8809,5.7172,4.8664,1.1274,3.0948,0.1972,1.1005,0.3924,1.0357,2.5507,0.9717,5.2033,1.7569,2.2552,3.5312,0.8768,0.1909,2.3805,0.2679,2.6127,8.0212,1.6209,4.5713,2.8335,5.2068,2.4394,0.7968,0.7544,0.1439,2.2568,0.4423,0.3787,1.3819,3.5307,2.5223,1.0393,2.749,6.2165,3.3938,6.1121,4.332,2.2687,0.6087,2.0608,5.719,0.5273,5.1353,4.1537,4.7011,3.942,4.3444,1.0481,2.2412,1.6758,0.7592,0.3697,1.5317,3.1129,0.5748,2.9993,3.6351,1.0793,3.5893,0.0372,4.9825,0.3586,1.2962,1.8884,4.5864,1.6068,7.0796,2.7797,4.0997,0.8467,1.9499,0.5599,3.2335,2.1192,0.7997,0.5422,5.2391,7.955,6.8573,1.5002,1.5857,2.5819,2.1293,3.9065,3.2853,1.4357,3.7358,0.5636,5.7631,1.8853,5.4999,5.6544,1.1972,3.0652,0.8585,5.7396,1.0585,6.8626,2.706,6.5093,3.7673,0.1205,0.1987,7.4872,0.0248,2.3086,4.1683,2.0368,2.9865,0.5152,0.4853,3.2844,1.1349,0.593,1.945,0.404,3.1912,2.4076,2.5019,4.7604,2.1451,3.4444,1.8209,1.8711,4.4531,4.2539,0.5438,2.1174,5.69,0.8081,0.1499,5.5272,0.8034,5.2421,3.1965,2.6542,2.9436,1.9772,0.4839,0.805,2.0744,12.5385,4.3573,0.6344,7.4415,1.4363,3.8338,2.173,6.0117,7.1517,2.7086,3.5179,1.8074,0.9828,2.5515,3.4278,1.2692,6.2917,0.0466,4.8051,0.0269,3.6553,6.1684,4.7172,2.496,4.3007,0.4015,1.1396,0.5517,1.1285,3.9391,1.0514,3.4806,1.2377,0.095,4.5295,2.3329,2.2827,1.9321,0.8143,1.6738,1.3938,2.5342,1.7379,3.1233,3.0021,1.8819,3.1056,1.1579,0.0745,4.0416,1.1268,6.1235,4.25,4.2968,3.1658,5.3884,4.2391,0.0086,2.5968,1.963,3.8671,0.4993,5.2657,0.1574,1.9855,0.1516,1.7317,3.6683,1.4087,7.3766,0.0798,1.2581,1.9393,1.7582,4.4362,1.4751,1.9127,3.0283,2.2127,0.2446,2.7923,1.3132,3.4272,2.678,0.5194,0.578,2.3147,1.0081,4.5989,6.0483,2.1057,1.0596,0.4921,0.818]}

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be my boyfriend who does it. I\u2019m probably just doing it to be an awesome girlfriend in the end!\nThis is awesome! My roommate is literally randomly taking anyone he wants out and never telling me first which is so annoying!! So annoying! I would totally get that\u2026 but it would be on her. I would like to have the power to turn a man completely around in a day or two. No joke! Thank you for this awesome idea! =3\nI have an unseen partner in my bedroom. I love her but I am afraid of her. I have the powers of invisibility, flight and hypnosis and she uses them on me. I like it. Sometimes I am in love and he calls me from a different city for 3 nights in a row. It goes on so much and I have to decide I get frustrated and get angry and then I stop doing it. I tell him to stop calling me. This can last a week with this man and then I go to another man and he doesn\u2019t tell me anything in advance. The other thing is I love being with men. I like giving them orgasms more than I like to give them. I can\u2019t count the number of men I gave them and it just happens like every other day. The other day it was a dog for me when a man gave me a foot and tongue massage of his entire foot and I never thought that was possible. I feel very special to get that. I also enjoy touching and stroking their toes and the way their skin feels.","token_len":385,"entropy":[3.7836,1.2646,2.3862,13.907,6.6665,3.2018,2.6007,6.3181,2.5909,1.8361,3.8836,4.5153,3.3999,0.7628,2.2996,1.626,2.3848,5.0676,0.9219,1.4683,1.0104,2.5555,5.0651,4.0622,3.9775,1.1951,5.0983,7.2782,1.1519,3.0406,4.648,2.5582,3.5056,0.3441,4.6101,1.036,8.2054,3.3878,3.2269,2.9087,8.1055,1.8197,17.3203,8.6059,2.9449,3.0186,0.0677,3.5404,0.5299,4.3254,1.7887,2.2065,1.5087,2.5274,2.6859,1.5705,4.2612,0.1176,0.2577,4.8804,1.8684,3.0558,0.0976,1.7254,1.7347,0.0318,0.8346,4.7775,7.6177,3.9001,3.1535,0.6162,1.3391,1.2712,2.3982,0.0188,0.0464,4.6637,5.1526,3.8534,0.4898,1.7621,3.7184,4.9474,3.5085,4.1463,4.3838,1.3291,1.7586,2.7067,0.9931,3.9372,1.1251,4.3486,1.4677,4.661,6.1484,1.8627,6.1152,9.8362,4.8661,7.9078,2.7736,1.4528,3.4482,2.6054,6.52,3.2097,3.8648,8.7362,5.501,4.0814,4.3456,5.0555,2.5552,3.819,7.0115,1.9191,1.4685,4.4442,3.9208,3.8783,3.372,7.4364,3.3772,2.6814,2.0923,0.7435,7.563,4.2758,3.1606,1.5869,1.4935,4.2813,0.4166,2.8956,3.1974,4.3874,0.5065,3.6018,3.8796,4.4756,6.1131,3.7159,3.4822,1.9503,3.6527,1.9123,0.6696,1.279,5.3234,5.7248,1.4549,5.9059,0.193,2.2467,3.0512,2.3282,0.461,1.0931,8.4941,4.182,0.6134,1.7123,3.1945,4.2051,11.1374,4.8094,3.3158,1.4185,5.0636,1.5751,1.4745,3.485,2.8417,4.6996,1.1753,3.3623,3.3082,3.0655,1.4041,1.5326,1.1072,2.5267,4.1814,5.5716,0.9919,3.2237,0.0025,2.1713,7.7278,1.2445,7.6591,0.0115,2.8306,1.4331,4.6565,1.0402,2.6691,0.2815,1.0126,1.0585,4.0137,2.4892,2.1191,6.5774,0.8391,3.2865,3.3246,3.024,2.4447,5.076,5.56,0.4949,5.0521,3.4492,2.826,4.3487,5.2992,7.504,4.0281,3.8124,0.1509,0.002,0.8768,2.8252,5.5193,0.8076,3.0758,2.6352,3.0092,0.9321,3.1268,1.1844,5.5842,5.4471,5.5673,7.5984,1.5975,3.6933,3.6801,2.1518,3.3458,1.5077,4.8656,3.5079,0.4332,0.7242,1.1054,5.4611,0.5714,1.9757,1.6338,2.5461,0.2555,2.3029,4.2805,4.3021,5.7171,2.0286,2.2849,5.6625,4.3183,4.2357,2.0554,2.9551,1.3728,3.4106,1.2658,4.2217,2.7916,1.5605,1.3951,3.6466,2.3148,1.0311,0.0975,4.0537,0.0566,3.0303,5.6935,3.9945,0.7711,4.252,3.6745,5.3544,0.7268,1.8478,3.2946,3.8396,3.2007,5.4642,1.2836,0.7896,2.353,6.391,1.4407,8.0542,0.0143,5.7826,0.9898,1.6605,2.4034,3.1988,1.9669,0.5399,3.5897,0.9416,3.7247,4.8123,0.0814,0.0019,6.9988,1.8323,0.5264,0.0229,4.8931,0.9951,6.1287,2.0249,2.1026,2.4687,3.2789,5.075,5.8221,3.2773,2.5366,0.7788,0.4432,3.9632,3.3019,2.1098,3.52,0.9219,2.4343,7.2961,5.5244,1.0106,4.8207,3.9208,1.5635,3.4735,0.1598,0.8523,7.6507,4.0349,10.9015,2.1611,6.1229,0.8699,6.801,4.2396,1.7059,1.4066,5.3422,3.0931,2.7049,2.4896,1.7097,0.6403,1.1425,4.5266,4.2809,4.4766,3.4674,4.3998,2.1735,2.7747,1.2648,4.5329,5.1344,5.7049,2.8477,4.3477,0.0005,5.2612,4.1319,1.4854,3.6949,2.4276,2.5281,3.538,1.505,1.3181]}

Then rinse and dry with a soft cloth.\nAfter it is completely dry, put the bowl in a cupboard or drawer with other pots, pans, etc. It can be stored together \u2013 in a cupboard or under the sink (if there is a gap for it).\nHere is a list of other baking dishes you might want \u2013 so that you don\u2019t end up buying them all at once.","token_len":387,"entropy":[2.571,8.9273,6.482,1.2898,5.4881,3.422,14.3476,0.0742,6.6096,1.296,2.1233,0.6449,1.3427,0.5755,4.406,4.6759,3.5639,7.3551,2.6406,2.1012,0.6514,2.8041,2.3343,2.9671,0.707,5.0043,3.6635,0.4415,2.2224,0.7429,2.4571,3.1535,3.0079,3.3828,3.6056,1.8725,0.5389,2.0472,1.0184,11.9841,0.4223,3.4192,3.796,3.5875,0.0498,3.5625,17.0481,7.8318,1.1252,2.4097,0.3441,0.1718,6.6883,1.6258,6.9099,0.4872,9.4779,2.749,2.7398,3.9871,5.1236,4.1455,4.0747,3.1479,5.6599,6.167,1.6606,1.6139,3.4568,2.6882,0.4303,5.1238,1.8461,4.2859,3.7853,0.3571,4.2718,2.3475,2.3228,1.7816,3.3028,5.6121,4.1356,8.8653,3.2416,1.4217,4.5346,5.0599,0.5122,12.0584,0.2794,0.5563,3.0266,5.004,2.7571,3.4823,4.8375,2.1712,6.5849,0.125,3.5323,1.2713,1.1159,7.3104,2.4872,2.3633,5.9737,0.044,0.7833,4.8408,2.4876,1.0023,1.6911,0.3615,5.2144,0.3526,1.8188,2.0699,2.2514,0.0556,2.244,6.8505,7.3458,4.6698,7.7549,0.7565,0.9046,5.8403,3.1313,0.4727,1.5972,8.1903,2.479,1.0724,2.0089,4.6016,3.5487,0.4629,3.4824,4.9169,0.7341,0.4151,1.5133,5.827,0.4685,1.0598,1.8921,2.7521,4.7567,1.6397,3.9673,5.1125,3.6951,3.3188,3.2009,1.4507,1.0049,4.2439,4.4991,0.4912,2.2718,2.6932,0.5627,3.3219,2.1857,1.7298,4.1229,1.5974,2.84,0.1207,0.3958,0.0583,0.8222,0.4768,0.1135,2.5876,5.1765,2.4589,3.465,3.6529,5.8907,3.8134,6.0647,2.0247,0.8334,0.6765,2.1913,2.0682,6.9996,2.5433,0.3808,0.3871,3.2699,1.8226,1.9829,4.4553,4.2076,6.046,0.0737,0.4217,3.1384,4.3692,0.2032,0.0123,0.8731,5.1065,0.1352,2.3787,2.0293,0.6185,4.9105,0.5823,5.4651,4.9684,3.7755,1.1772,5.7609,4.1942,4.3417,5.8745,3.4144,4.7453,1.0568,3.3825,3.7486,0.7703,0.176,2.299,3.5785,1.8496,1.8487,0.0943,0.1022,2.3574,1.2507,2.6881,0.811,2.7295,3.3317,7.1798,0.3859,0.5917,0.0883,4.2548,4.1699,1.0138,8.403,3.8507,5.4655,3.5076,4.2317,0.7207,6.383,1.5712,1.9275,4.2895,4.2721,2.599,0.453,1.752,4.9427,0.9666,2.3434,5.7778,2.366,2.7735,0.9982,4.7563,0.5636,1.2349,7.9205,3.0268,4.4152,6.0759,1.5001,3.602,0.0003,2.3498,3.6087,6.4542,0.6621,2.2179,0.0493,2.0623,2.0752,4.3248,1.7331,0.6381,2.2429,0.3087,0.3822,3.5627,0.4628,4.6028,3.8085,4.8539,4.9778,1.8828,7.5025,0.01,0.0798,1.8942,4.3674,1.9326,3.1035,1.908,1.4995,1.358,4.4452,0.2661,0.4729,2.7657,4.4649,5.5807,1.1748,3.8114,0.2758,0.1692,2.9842,1.3014,5.2119,2.267,1.8228,5.2174,1.276,1.6057,4.6222,3.4337,6.1318,4.9415,2.096,1.2734,0.4675,3.5574,0.2822,3.7441,3.0422,0.4181,4.646,7.476,5.6953,2.9442,1.0918,3.4724,0.0898,0.5298,4.8657,2.0065,1.0383,4.1534,2.5873,3.8672,0.5413,1.148,7.7735,4.7632,0.9673,1.0351,1.2393,5.5901,1.0478,1.2469,2.9837,0.0384,4.3385,3.9845,1.517,2.861,2.3634,0.9724,8.3544,4.7132,1.5063,0.2663,2.0102,0.0429,0.0973,0.0953,4.0429,0.0025,6.0836,2.0996,0.7249,2.0922,0.1688,0.7174]}
{"prompt":"The distant ancestors of a planet-born race return to their home system to watch the sun finally go out .","text":"The distant ancestors of a planet-born race return to their home system to watch the sun finally go out. These ancestors are now a thousand years removed from the beginning of the planet\u2019s life and have been able to communicate with the ancestors who left on the same system ten thousand years ago. However, they do not have enough time to find the original planet, which is only a few Earth radii distant. However, one of the many ways to communicate is through a hologram that has been placed above the planet. To use this hologram, two descendants must travel to the hologram to make contact. One of the descendants makes sure there a ship is available to take him and his friend back to the planet, but after they depart a mysterious object shoots off into interstellar space.\nThis sounds like a futuristic movie or at least a book. However, this is science fiction, and it is not much more than an idea that some science fiction authors have used, not even a lot of science fiction authors.\nIf this is science fiction, then I see it the way it was presented in that old science fiction movie the Outer Limits. The original book was written in 1978 and had been published in 1962. The idea that such a primitive species can not move from their home planet to see the star die and go back a thousand or ten thousand years is a very futuristic idea.\nThere is a question about how many times a living species can travel through the stars before it has to die. If an advanced civilization can have their planetary ship travel a light year, then that must be about 1,260,900,000 miles on the average. This is enough time for a species to die while traveling to new homes. The descendants of that species are not able to go for that long before they die, and they have to return to the planet, but there is no way they can go back so many years.","token_len":387,"entropy":[10.5239,7.3834,0.2242,5.1295,6.0375,4.4856,7.236,2.895,9.0211,0.6378,2.4313,1.4701,4.7238,2.5229,6.1168,2.4251,3.4862,7.9778,4.5914,2.2484,1.4894,5.1775,5.09,1.6861,4.1881,3.8109,5.6043,0.5923,4.9128,0.035,1.1604,3.9237,0.1954,1.0986,4.8468,13.6785,7.6101,7.004,2.7961,2.9039,3.8357,2.3723,4.4218,0.0118,4.8721,0.4579,1.3065,5.1839,3.9492,3.2955,5.3145,1.3577,4.0199,6.0259,7.3249,0.4463,0.0384,0.1922,0.4858,3.6626,0.0806,2.0533,3.9565,0.1268,2.3355,3.2767,1.1194,0.1844,4.8527,1.7806,4.7868,4.2112,1.9546,2.2264,1.1739,4.3743,1.5338,1.1751,6.9171,8.6005,0.2914,4.2753,2.4067,4.2091,0.0477,4.2617,0.869,0.6451,5.1286,4.4086,1.9462,3.8083,2.6797,1.057,2.0451,4.9392,0.739,2.3243,2.9609,0.539,2.825,5.1388,0.5467,1.5339,1.323,4.7405,3.6651,0.9826,0.4088,0.0359,0.2977,4.8356,7.9379,3.8713,3.226,0.946,0.552,6.9541,0.0961,2.1958,4.0578,1.9516,2.1673,3.3776,0.8827,0.5809,0.7732,6.7106,4.9621,4.8566,9.3777,5.5175,1.3968,3.7818,1.2798,2.7199,3.7925,3.0217,2.1755,4.8844,3.0253,0.2044,0.6286,1.2217,1.9508,2.3451,4.921,2.6003,4.9603,5.2007,5.6807,4.2728,6.8358,4.5337,2.6681,6.9779,0.009,0.5982,2.2136,8.0783,7.7204,0.8911,0.6864,5.3544,4.0781,4.5835,5.2581,0.0894,1.4801,7.0337,2.0587,2.3834,0.1156,2.5911,1.2075,7.4762,0.0131,1.9144,0.9698,2.0631,1.1749,1.7258,6.4219,1.7677,0.3577,2.5972,3.9835,2.3613,4.6146,4.3988,0.1828,2.5835,1.3474,4.4332,4.3385,4.8323,3.1816,2.9795,4.3225,0.3487,2.4562,0.1409,2.6408,3.062,2.4044,4.1809,2.8118,1.3727,4.2867,0.041,0.4008,0.94,2.6137,4.6517,2.6389,6.7641,1.8119,1.4524,2.5586,4.8827,0.7858,5.4003,7.2967,3.143,0.303,2.2445,5.7011,7.6685,0.442,0.809,1.9635,3.9522,4.8161,1.4865,2.6268,1.669,5.454,1.4472,3.1882,2.8671,2.374,1.0959,5.735,0.8001,1.3998,4.5831,2.0897,5.0805,0.5646,6.7275,3.2997,3.839,5.2628,4.9764,4.0361,1.8239,0.8374,1.0605,1.5752,7.1635,0.7399,4.2916,10.0796,3.0813,3.5802,1.7239,6.2509,0.4358,6.9256,3.3127,0.8361,0.0226,1.2707,2.3328,3.008,4.4927,0.5466,0.7789,1.5411,3.9088,1.0047,1.3097,6.0262,2.4488,2.1486,2.4933,3.562,2.4003,6.298,2.3126,1.6963,2.6091,2.4654,2.6936,2.9309,3.8968,1.4479,3.4819,0.9512,2.0521,0.8772,2.7526,4.4372,5.2239,1.6774,2.2547,4.7932,4.5732,7.5235,5.6106,4.0032,3.6357,7.8744,1.4683,1.7004,1.2417,2.6439,4.4725,0.8855,3.8877,3.8168,1.1393,7.8418,1.0449,6.0858,1.7316,0.1986,5.1425,5.5645,1.7731,4.3178,0.6826,2.6255,0.9897,5.4637,1.6597,0.9738,1.4745,2.9298,0.3724,3.5196,5.6071,1.3206,3.2776,6.14,8.6353,0.9647,2.5712,7.5902,0.2622,4.1735,1.2503,2.2714,2.7634,2.408,0.0077,3.3047,5.5739,2.7257,0.6152,3.5099,0.6459,1.3088,1.3442,1.8033,2.5252,2.4817,0.5666,3.5828,0.5468,1.6517,1.0203,3.27,2.2913,3.3714,0.5394,0.8188,0.7702,1.8269,0.645,2.2411,0.4624,4.9703,3.8017,0.6143,0.9417]}

{"prompt":"Trying to teach a spider how to knit may be a bit more difficult than you originally thought it would be .","text":"Trying to teach a spider how to knit may be a bit more difficult than you originally thought it would be. So, let\u2019s take a look at how it can be achieved.\nThe best way to teach a spider how to knit, and make sure you have a large enough area to work on. If you live somewhere small ( especially in the country ) you will also need to leave the space enough for it to be able to move away from and leave the area.\nYou can use any number of different materials for the activity. I like to use soft and flexible items like a hat, scarf, socks, scarves, and etc. You can also combine these with different items, for example, you can use a hat and a hatband with a piece of ribbon. All you need is something it can grip easily, with one of these in one hand and one in the other, it\u2019s very intuitive. Just make sure that you\u2019ve got enough room in which to do it.\nIf you have access to a larger area, you can teach a spider to knit with a hat as a base. It\u2019s something that you can easily do on a larger area. For instance, you can knit your yarn into a cylinder and then place the cylinder of yarn in front of the spider. This way, we can see clearly what she is doing.\nWe can place an item in the space that the spider can see. This is going to be her project. It can be anything you like, but make sure that it has a nice and smooth surface. With a piece of ribbon or tape, a hat or scarf, you can create this item. Then by placing the project in front of the creature, it will become part of its daily activity.\nWhen you do this, it will see and learn from the spider and will be able to imitate it as soon as possible.","token_len":389,"entropy":[9.7225,0.1262,5.9942,2.6445,9.6927,1.3565,0.0198,6.4691,6.1706,1.1541,1.6169,2.0264,3.2566,1.0121,0.8801,2.4122,6.9202,0.3645,5.1104,0.4297,0.0983,0.5764,4.049,1.6063,3.4599,19.2316,8.2202,2.5413,2.7259,0.2969,0.4904,0.2001,1.8007,2.0788,3.8152,0.8256,5.0406,0.6623,0.4931,4.7775,4.3324,0.4271,0.128,3.1069,0.4565,0.0816,0.5306,0.0038,0.0291,4.3837,3.1408,4.7229,2.7089,1.6976,2.352,1.9822,5.6081,2.5633,4.4036,1.3332,3.3808,1.8444,4.455,3.9094,0.3041,5.9372,4.9506,6.2405,3.1081,11.3723,1.3292,1.4781,5.4469,1.8956,1.7083,1.901,4.8804,0.7372,0.6579,6.2114,3.0298,4.0441,7.0967,1.1811,3.2366,0.079,2.6818,1.854,0.0065,2.3654,5.7986,0.2905,6.8004,5.9077,1.4911,4.0589,2.0639,1.7003,3.1783,1.1537,2.4964,2.9503,3.6495,0.0088,2.0502,2.652,2.8093,1.396,7.5634,0.9862,2.7923,3.4046,0.6995,0.5791,5.5467,3.3089,3.7461,6.8687,1.3802,3.7111,4.1324,0.8607,2.1833,0.373,3.9724,0.4357,6.6692,0.0152,0.4091,1.8112,5.6243,0.3261,3.3876,0.5574,0.8514,5.7149,3.021,1.5425,3.3354,4.4192,2.8674,3.6595,0.2258,1.7871,3.5181,0.5539,1.0806,1.4958,3.1358,3.2668,1.9662,2.7778,6.1987,3.8878,1.6441,4.9096,0.0885,5.8874,1.6561,4.9826,2.105,0.586,1.1552,4.402,8.0527,0.5316,8.3193,4.0876,1.854,4.8768,4.1554,3.2772,1.7809,5.091,4.558,1.3147,1.2317,1.8177,1.308,0.3075,0.0078,2.0245,2.9281,12.4123,0.2003,0.1464,2.7705,7.662,0.5697,4.9059,2.0935,0.0595,2.1236,0.7817,5.7195,0.1455,0.5939,2.7357,2.1756,2.5889,2.4927,6.1494,0.3084,3.8348,1.7707,0.6673,0.7022,2.9941,0.1965,1.9352,6.0003,0.0257,0.6864,4.9005,0.9925,1.149,0.9773,0.559,6.7917,1.9676,0.1923,1.3982,0.6176,2.3771,1.3224,3.41,4.3932,3.3075,4.0344,0.7321,3.0926,1.4762,0.0526,0.0331,5.9295,1.2322,1.1845,0.8672,3.6115,1.9757,2.533,2.1317,3.9561,2.4387,1.2727,3.6129,2.4529,0.2241,1.4301,0.7015,3.0443,3.8628,5.1536,3.5122,0.536,7.442,1.9509,1.649,3.8479,1.8068,1.7266,5.4925,0.1918,0.9979,2.4672,0.0674,1.0508,1.6736,1.0547,2.184,2.4121,0.9554,5.5823,0.4198,3.2684,5.9985,2.2661,5.1395,0.7276,0.7522,0.8808,0.9611,4.46,0.7506,6.3357,4.5897,2.2036,1.3389,1.4333,4.7394,2.3289,2.9364,0.5005,1.9078,3.3004,1.5671,2.1375,1.694,6.2556,0.0238,0.8926,5.1364,6.8807,1.111,3.3092,2.8934,0.8357,2.6566,2.1024,2.4694,1.1813,1.2417,4.3737,0.0348,0.7472,1.1424,3.0424,1.7795,3.7434,3.4113,3.5232,0.8124,1.0107,5.9551,1.5655,3.1732,0.0178,1.9708,1.7117,3.8124,0.7468,4.6329,4.0048,1.4786,0.7171,0.7903,2.1617,0.2154,3.9031,3.7901,6.6982,1.0277,4.568,7.0484,2.1947,0.9322,7.2108,0.9689,2.4382,0.0107,0.5529,5.9403,0.5445,2.1027,1.7314,4.2025,3.2183,0.0095,3.945,6.3455,2.6757,0.2781,0.6567,3.509,1.1544,3.8564,0.6806,0.3752,1.8938,1.1431,5.7847,3.3725,3.6687,2.591,1.5117,0.6391,2.677,2.3317,2.0059,0.2538,0.0041,6.2805,2.3805,3.6114,5.4141,0.0125,1.6692,0.1463]}

{"prompt":"Aliens have landed and are instilling everyone with a super power based on their natural abilities . You however are extremely disappointed in yours .","text":"Aliens have landed and are instilling everyone with a super power based on their natural abilities. You however are extremely disappointed in yours. In your opinion you are simply not worthy of these new superpowers.\nHowever, as you are awakened by the sound of the alien ship, you realize that you have just missed out on a terrific opportunity. Your opportunity to become a super hero like Iron Man (Hulk: Not in this timeline).\nThe movie also shows super soldiers as the primary combatants who are the ones that will be destroying humanity. They are given super powers as well.\nSo, now you are the only one who still retains his natural human abilities like sight, hearing and so on but you also hold a magical blade. This blade keeps everything normal in reality like it is. It creates illusions like a magical box. This world where most of the characters live resembles a real town. But in reality they are all illusions based on a secret experiment and the super soldiers and superheroes are nothing more than actors.\nBut the real experiment, they want to do to humanity is to make it extinct. The experiment was to breed with a species of humanoid aliens who have the blood type and DNA of humans and make people immortal. They used this method of human mutation by breeding with these aliens to make mutants.\nThe experiment actually succeeded and resulted in a human race that was almost entirely immovable and lifeless. So, everyone in the world was given superpowers by aliens except for the normal humans who were bred by them.\nIt is very clear what the experiment would entail. The idea is to create the world of superheroes in the world, where humans and aliens live together and also be able to make them work for the aliens.\nThis is obviously a bad experiment that is going to go wrong. In reality, the aliens will discover and destroy the experiment and return back, if they manage to go back, to their own planet.","token_len":389,"entropy":[9.9962,6.0726,7.2659,4.5702,1.7705,12.541,1.9951,8.4282,1.5237,1.3864,8.1601,3.0182,6.9602,0.4231,1.5094,5.1521,1.5751,0.7075,4.6313,9.9346,2.3551,6.6294,8.0985,2.1482,7.5034,1.2426,4.2961,3.5808,2.8757,2.5953,1.3792,4.0171,1.9654,4.7193,0.3684,5.3205,4.9393,5.2198,2.1262,0.6915,1.7511,8.1917,0.6614,3.6811,1.3903,2.339,9.1623,1.9336,1.3373,7.3661,0.0788,1.7268,5.9037,3.9183,1.4386,0.7136,2.6775,0.487,1.232,1.6923,4.3814,7.0937,1.1839,0.2171,1.9229,8.3995,0.3768,1.4683,3.3439,7.5324,1.2311,3.2371,1.1158,1.7797,1.2239,6.4498,7.1944,0.1312,5.4051,5.3013,1.0441,7.4613,7.1706,4.5715,1.5782,6.1723,2.3222,1.6589,2.8562,5.6585,3.7434,3.6535,8.8276,5.5496,4.1404,3.5037,5.0574,5.254,4.8542,1.8251,3.702,3.1584,2.5183,2.6986,2.6644,6.2257,3.8214,0.7507,3.1823,0.8273,5.0633,3.4952,0.3196,3.8939,1.2834,1.0803,1.6341,4.333,1.5414,4.4479,1.236,1.7986,3.4474,3.6645,0.8865,0.8625,4.9411,6.4736,3.8036,5.395,5.8733,0.8753,5.8868,10.1875,0.9808,0.7462,1.4602,4.9005,0.6091,4.3004,1.4228,3.7799,6.5699,2.3281,6.424,7.124,2.3804,2.933,1.2427,6.4585,4.5963,7.6318,3.193,5.4744,4.7595,2.8821,1.1664,2.9307,2.6244,5.8628,4.1209,3.2057,2.908,4.6423,6.7628,1.7992,2.7985,5.5228,5.4293,5.3384,1.1081,0.7345,4.5845,1.9444,7.3165,1.0252,3.0247,7.1754,1.2656,3.6568,3.5147,0.9646,4.3328,0.7673,3.2145,6.2214,4.9352,0.1598,2.8452,5.3695,6.8764,4.2128,2.6269,4.9105,1.5363,4.885,4.4296,1.4319,4.9718,0.8608,0.0532,7.4937,1.4409,0.7855,3.3495,3.0597,2.5227,8.6319,4.4981,4.4371,4.9951,0.4892,2.8938,3.3068,4.2889,3.4872,0.8733,2.8848,2.6763,6.0524,0.6119,2.879,5.1807,3.5895,2.1208,7.4159,5.1954,2.9626,3.7897,1.3032,4.6624,3.852,2.6785,3.3678,2.7678,7.3163,5.4218,3.9886,3.3536,0.7822,1.2957,2.0152,3.6989,4.9966,2.8284,0.487,2.5473,4.8938,2.1208,4.1971,1.7498,5.6347,5.373,4.9316,2.2014,1.0016,3.6981,1.3965,2.4607,1.4698,5.9238,1.3953,1.2737,2.2923,4.4885,5.9904,4.037,2.2996,6.7798,0.0272,2.0094,2.8336,1.7137,1.3523,2.127,4.6345,3.0043,8.7224,3.7466,2.1519,6.0068,0.3997,3.6723,1.2359,5.3862,3.1983,0.8884,1.4617,2.0304,4.0538,1.8596,2.5749,3.331,4.0632,7.2053,0.7051,1.4467,6.4273,1.4406,2.1998,1.1747,6.3955,2.7619,2.8926,0.5638,1.043,4.0195,1.1897,3.8453,2.5347,4.0715,1.9465,3.5742,4.3352,5.4475,0.9017,1.9469,5.4146,1.303,0.7471,1.3854,3.2638,2.7101,2.2845,5.2957,3.2706,2.2467,3.7503,3.9613,3.1215,2.9423,2.3419,2.0601,2.4279,1.8504,1.7565,6.8753,4.8623,2.308,0.0021,3.7322,3.733,5.6938,2.9023,1.511,4.8833,0.5001,1.0536,2.9285,1.0869,5.6599,1.7474,4.2046,7.2594,3.3987,2.2007,3.0677,0.1751,5.0338,1.9481,0.7688,3.8974,2.8675,0.9524,1.5349,1.9669,2.8327,7.6092,3.3433,2.1282,1.4723,6.031,1.2473,5.4892,4.7619,6.0223,4.9163,0.9121,4.4092,0.1049,6.2389,1.1635,2.5446,2.6082,1.7654,2.6105,2.0411,0.6248]}

''\nWhat is the difference between the term \" drug \" and the term \" substance \"? There are lots of drugs in the market, but why do we have this term \" drug \" in this phrase? It's because there are many substances that people do not use correctly, but they call it a drug and get a drug addiction. The term drug, for example, can describe any substance that is harmful and harmful. The term substance is more restrictive and more specific. It refers to harmful substances. It does not refer to good substances. '' '' To hold your breath for an hour '' What is the meaning of the expression \"to hold your breath for an hour \"? The phrase expresses that a victim of addiction cannot control their breath and their breathing. This person could hardly find a word for this horrible feeling they are feeling. For this reason, they cannot speak aloud. Instead of talking, they hold their breath and get more and more upset. They are very unhappy and depressed. They feel like their world has ended. When speaking, \" holding your breath \" is a way of speaking more clearly when speaking. It sounds like a sound and a word are being held inside you, and this sound is always in your mouth. \" Your breath is stifled by your emotions. '' When someone is depressed because of a mental issue or something else, he can often get confused. He can't tell whether he's feeling good or bad. In this case, he might say a word that actually means a good feeling or a bad feeling. Like, \" What are you doing? \" That may seem wrong, but it actually means that he does not feel good but does not say it out loud.","token_len":390,"entropy":[6.6348,1.1894,3.4667,7.57,2.2751,1.5659,3.7568,2.0555,4.4828,0.703,0.0012,7.2327,0.9079,3.2833,0.9263,6.0865,2.3087,1.0381,1.698,1.7353,5.7271,0.873,1.422,5.019,0.4466,9.3607,0.4337,1.5972,5.641,1.8527,1.3248,0.0174,3.8354,2.433,3.0972,3.6186,0.9251,3.5271,0.4909,3.9446,0.7218,0.1639,2.3517,4.2526,0.1883,4.4097,3.7558,0.2161,8.3213,3.5222,7.0935,2.4873,2.1119,3.6278,0.2902,2.5222,5.8349,1.8391,11.3782,0.8851,0.0727,1.6921,1.1927,0.047,5.4446,0.1934,1.5766,5.1682,0.9703,4.7966,0.0696,4.9876,2.1104,0.9823,3.8795,1.4956,1.2196,5.728,1.874,1.632,2.4264,4.5997,2.6184,3.019,1.1863,0.2923,2.6098,2.6674,6.013,0.1687,2.2309,0.7909,2.4682,2.8249,0.6816,2.6024,3.0908,1.6794,3.6583,3.8795,0.9018,2.3918,7.3647,1.3717,2.5254,2.4805,5.0265,1.9627,2.6024,0.9516,3.4713,5.9638,3.1043,3.1271,6.6999,0.5008,2.5275,1.9808,2.9558,3.7657,3.4252,0.5935,0.0259,4.0041,4.5754,1.874,1.2986,0.8912,1.4359,4.9741,3.0745,4.0767,3.1438,2.4565,1.2252,0.8705,1.2242,3.9964,6.8353,2.5473,2.014,4.1471,1.1744,1.6098,3.8661,0.1138,7.3895,0.7461,2.1023,1.5452,3.6376,0.0964,1.404,0.0576,5.7772,1.4067,0.4605,4.9953,7.2745,6.558,5.6308,1.6699,0.0204,2.8064,2.9998,1.2801,7.2191,4.3575,1.4418,0.5772,4.1867,0.0766,0.8275,5.1703,0.3125,5.0725,0.6163,0.1735,0.0153,1.186,0.2914,0.0052,3.3354,0.739,2.3062,2.7537,6.8888,3.3253,3.5969,9.1819,1.3239,3.7354,3.8491,4.1938,1.8543,4.7753,2.8828,4.1264,3.8148,3.3682,3.0613,5.7507,5.0581,6.8502,5.7516,1.1961,4.2615,2.0106,2.6312,6.9765,2.8547,4.8473,2.1069,1.9034,0.8068,4.6949,3.4268,1.109,0.3629,2.6208,3.8031,3.5249,5.9154,1.5857,4.0324,2.2805,3.5153,0.8743,0.4047,4.8707,0.2369,0.0772,2.1277,5.6182,4.9624,0.251,0.0026,5.1879,0.4623,1.7732,2.7053,4.0492,4.5081,1.6023,3.9534,0.4314,1.4079,2.4612,2.2893,3.1165,4.9303,1.464,3.4776,0.6443,4.3706,8.3564,0.8592,6.1586,6.7843,0.0973,0.0011,0.6252,1.283,2.2286,3.2511,0.9971,4.8114,5.7103,1.6025,6.108,2.2437,2.0251,1.7902,4.4472,1.4875,1.4649,4.866,3.655,3.0867,2.721,5.766,3.2374,4.5741,6.0425,2.784,2.1673,2.3418,3.2507,4.6679,0.8499,5.916,3.5577,1.1369,2.2802,0.3239,4.4423,6.302,2.1508,0.7542,6.9724,1.6638,2.4522,1.9941,4.6193,0.6763,4.4162,3.8109,4.4131,1.897,4.0226,5.718,0.6937,2.0841,4.5034,5.3274,2.6886,3.8085,3.4681,0.2611,4.0908,2.8608,4.7287,3.1782,5.92,1.6139,1.8412,1.4092,2.1501,3.5043,3.0634,1.6219,1.6966,2.6584,2.1658,0.1399,0.7869,0.6974,4.0318,2.3026,1.4466,0.0878,0.9523,3.5273,1.5384,5.3035,1.4456,1.6432,6.6966,1.1393,3.7478,3.7194,4.3418,1.6227,0.8046,0.2622,0.1933,0.3481,6.8562,2.5538,0.5416,5.6422,2.536,0.5324,1.9064,1.5142,0.7344,4.6315,4.3388,3.1286,6.223,0.8574,0.0821,1.1739,4.387,0.5185,1.6331,2.7181,4.9042,0.2464,1.3065,0.6073,5.434,3.1563,1.4086,5.7284,3.8897,3.0575,0.0082,0.2368]}

When a local schoolteacher is brutally murdered, he must choose, at the age of eighty-three, whether to return to the small town for an extended retirement, or to stay to find the killer before his death.\nThis is how it went \u2013 The next day, Mr. O\u2019Hara, a middle-aged businessman, was on his way to the office when he was stopped by a woman. She was wearing a black dress and looked very glamorous. Her voice was angelic.\nHe thought for a moment and then said, \u201cHappy birthday, Mr. O\u2019Hara. Please sit for a moment. Maybe we can meet up again later?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I have an appointment with a client and I must go now.\u201d She was about to step out, but he stopped her and put his hands on her shoulder.\nShe said, \u201cMr. O\u2019Hara, I think you could be my boyfriend. Are you willing to marry me and have a family?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cOh, I must dash. I have an appointment with people I work for. Take care.\u201d And he got into the car.\nThey walked along the park where he would always take her, and she opened her purse to take out her ring. When the moment came, he put his hand on her shoulder and she placed the ring on his finger. He was thrilled.\nThe wedding ceremony took place with the blessings of her parents, and she had a perfect dress. After dinner she sat down at the piano and played a beautiful melody, so he asked her to sing for her guests while he paid her a visit in her room.","token_len":391,"entropy":[9.193,5.8009,8.6227,7.9108,3.8388,3.9587,11.9805,6.7949,1.9768,3.4864,2.6459,4.7739,1.3759,1.3101,1.2241,1.6021,7.8304,1.5291,5.6701,0.059,1.8207,4.3715,0.2206,1.018,7.1535,6.1527,1.5253,7.5704,0.625,0.0159,8.8249,0.9602,4.4665,3.5096,4.2797,5.109,3.6279,0.002,3.1706,5.9758,0.5982,1.014,1.5927,4.8441,3.0124,6.1585,5.1064,1.1229,3.0453,0.0033,5.9936,0.7587,2.2238,0.1229,1.981,0.2867,3.7348,0.2814,1.8522,2.5859,1.0575,4.1278,3.9819,2.0109,6.8108,1.917,0.3066,1.288,3.9447,4.6052,5.0189,2.6557,3.5984,6.1962,1.825,2.4468,0.3757,1.5603,6.9122,1.6902,5.5986,3.3254,4.6668,7.6683,4.7408,6.6638,3.8723,0.7775,4.8613,0.3376,4.7905,14.2272,6.4435,5.7225,4.5926,3.0627,1.9707,5.1233,0.1691,0.277,4.7735,0.6886,2.9706,4.0847,0.9317,0.0366,0.4892,2.0621,3.8115,1.793,1.0029,0.5316,4.0484,0.4122,0.9591,4.0755,2.104,1.8853,2.3895,3.8697,0.3912,2.4978,1.8954,1.2197,5.3463,2.908,8.1459,0.6649,3.3753,3.0366,0.4818,10.7446,0.0094,1.5782,2.9704,3.2026,4.2874,3.2309,0.0524,0.2997,2.6204,0.8146,1.9823,0.5374,8.3433,8.566,9.6276,1.5057,0.9689,2.9582,0.0658,0.3587,0.0563,0.0076,0.0421,0.0008,1.315,5.4545,5.8007,5.0889,0.6199,0.3806,0.9471,7.5887,2.4171,0.9832,2.9526,2.7455,2.4756,2.6728,4.3199,4.6787,5.9358,0.5751,2.2823,2.5382,0.7527,0.2048,1.547,1.9974,7.01,1.6341,1.0757,1.5073,5.2929,0.9566,3.0325,4.0286,1.2407,1.9174,1.8639,6.2103,3.3699,1.1987,3.6323,2.4585,3.6445,0.3748,1.9161,0.4012,3.0653,3.0002,4.7578,0.6765,5.9188,1.3086,3.205,0.5895,2.5916,2.2489,0.3401,1.1718,5.0041,0.3849,2.4613,0.6592,0.2203,1.9951,0.4577,1.2083,2.799,1.5245,0.1774,0.0934,0.266,4.5998,0.0219,0.1508,0.0113,0.0039,0.0129,0.0021,0.6771,1.5794,4.3178,1.2204,4.2749,3.5617,3.0139,4.6416,0.9015,6.224,0.0521,5.0395,0.1174,2.7894,0.2743,3.996,2.3551,1.5569,1.6733,0.6584,0.7266,0.1092,0.4001,0.8076,0.7346,0.4985,0.1439,0.0622,5.1334,0.4721,1.5581,5.7013,13.5678,3.2858,1.287,2.5609,3.3055,0.2021,0.7523,7.9563,3.1393,5.0731,2.4671,0.8691,7.9754,1.1596,2.5023,1.3127,0.0644,5.1358,1.591,4.3569,3.6853,1.735,0.4535,1.5236,0.8108,5.1329,4.1028,3.8758,0.6636,5.8951,3.6776,2.4189,4.7987,5.6405,3.9641,1.9065,2.8399,1.3597,2.1371,6.1322,2.342,3.6745,2.9098,3.9918,1.8332,1.5001,7.7853,0.5112,4.2029,2.6934,5.7874,0.9707,0.5136,1.4176,4.3811,0.8992,0.7547,0.5194,0.4846,1.2636,0.7017,3.1164,6.3858,2.5538,0.3186,0.6878,1.1036,1.4041,0.4194,1.94,2.9734,6.6011,0.9141,0.6262,2.5887,6.2741,2.9644,1.4811,0.1579,4.7068,1.7948,6.6474,0.1183,4.8821,4.8952,1.3884,1.3211,2.3109,2.9056,1.5671,4.5332,5.1467,1.1693,4.3813,3.7119,2.6732,3.2375,0.8433,2.4053,0.735,4.8423,0.8339,2.2053,1.8946,3.1333,3.9292,2.3805,4.6575,2.5315,4.0722,0.2122,1.2149,1.2416,3.0136,3.0811,6.7914,5.4356,0.9047,6.3112,1.7658,1.227,0.2378,4.6603,3.8859,2.3344,0.1506]}

The only way you can come out is when the first word from the prisoners cell unlocks the door. Do not touch the walls or it will kill you. Good Luck and enter the cell no 6.\nMy favorite game ever! There are endless variations, my personal favorites being the last few ones. Very entertaining and so much fun to play, even when you've lost. Keep up the good work!\nI'm really interested in this one, but it doesn't say how to complete the game without dying, only to win. I played one part and I managed to get through it but that was by accident. You must say something to unlock the door but once you do you just have to follow the instructions in order to complete the levels. I would really appreciate some clue to help me out!\nI have to give this a five but the instructions don't work. The directions say go into the second room from the first one but if you do it will kill you so go into the first room.\nI loved this game. I lost to the person below me so I tried to help them. It was pretty hard but I was a bit distracted by playing a puzzle game called The Hole. I tried to help him and he got through the first part but I lost. I tried the 2nd part and I got through it. Then I tried the 3rd part and I was able to help him. Then I tried the 4th part and lost as well.

This can even apply to things that happen in real life, such as murders or accidents. However, even in real life things often don\u2019t happen as quickly as they might in the movies\u2026.\nHowever, there is a certain part of me that isn\u2019t willing to just sit and wait for my life to end. In my case, I want to live my life as closely as possible as though it\u2019s my last day, as though it never has stopped. I\u2019ve done this for several years now.

{"prompt":"An older wealthy woman takes the city bus for the first time .","text":"An older wealthy woman takes the city bus for the first time. She has never used public transport before and she is unsure of where she might go. The driver suggests she go to the mall but before she leaves the bus she tells him that she has a shopping list. At the mall she finds a sale on a dress and buys it on the spot. She gets the dress and gets off the bus. Now the young woman, who is on the other side of the bus, is about to say something to the older woman, but she has lost her voice as her mother suddenly cries.\nIt is the day before Midsummernight and there is a heatwave. There is a fire at the gas station and lots of smoke is coming from it. The girl is at the gas station. When she is about to buy gas she notices that smoke is coming from the gas station and gas is getting hard to find. She runs towards the store. However, she loses the gas station and has no idea where to turn. She searches round but finds no gas station. She is almost out of gas. At a stop sign, she notices police cars. She gets out. She looks in the direction they are coming from and sees the fire. At a police car she tells the officer where she is from. As her voice fades she notices a policeman standing at the scene. He says he was going to report it but the firefighters caught it and it will be OK.\nA group is at a cafe. The table is close to an open window. The group orders drinks from the cafe. The waiters bring them drinks. Suddenly they smell a strong smell of burning. The table next to the customers falls down. All of the customers are injured, including two children. One of the children is bleeding and the police are at the scene. Then the girls tell their parents that their table fell down and something smelled very hot. The parents take the children to hospital.","token_len":395,"entropy":[8.7982,11.9323,3.3059,6.4464,2.2414,8.3267,3.7951,3.5948,1.8248,1.4544,0.1236,1.6237,1.4246,2.7947,3.8558,5.0074,3.9533,1.6532,0.4682,1.6515,2.3894,1.8109,5.6361,1.3896,2.521,0.7683,4.2047,1.3898,0.97,2.6633,4.0994,5.7772,1.2914,1.9409,0.5846,1.4915,4.3577,3.696,5.5022,0.2713,3.5317,2.0363,0.4506,1.0342,3.0765,1.7797,1.7533,0.5845,2.1608,1.9677,6.5137,1.699,1.5575,4.835,0.749,0.1624,1.5567,2.5575,0.8682,8.4448,2.7376,1.5445,5.087,2.6445,4.2482,1.7069,4.1486,0.4689,1.7225,0.3619,1.2801,4.2667,2.7832,2.2932,0.9354,4.0141,3.3372,1.0341,0.156,0.7232,5.907,2.2668,3.9923,0.9639,3.776,1.5235,1.1101,4.6578,1.1168,3.007,0.3528,0.1318,0.2733,2.4087,0.3688,1.7405,4.5928,0.0373,4.8369,1.4431,1.2259,0.828,3.8302,0.8499,2.0368,1.0466,1.6812,3.874,4.0235,0.9584,3.3981,3.9609,3.5211,3.9336,5.4948,5.254,1.6907,2.3455,9.2546,0.7806,2.5222,4.7808,1.6982,8.4893,4.6152,0.0841,10.5243,1.8321,4.3011,0.4919,0.6069,8.3647,1.5742,1.3259,3.578,0.5919,0.6706,2.7459,2.9076,0.4422,6.035,0.1405,1.311,8.1432,0.0507,3.4334,2.5287,1.4238,0.7398,2.0586,0.1822,1.2752,4.875,1.9912,4.7442,0.6427,1.0076,0.0151,3.2553,3.4338,0.5095,2.672,2.8593,0.0644,6.2533,4.1353,0.6684,2.6671,1.4511,6.187,0.7554,0.4778,0.2173,0.544,2.266,0.6169,1.63,8.1294,1.6478,3.9542,4.6159,2.3255,0.7957,0.2798,0.984,2.9405,3.8684,0.2369,2.5532,2.2081,4.9727,0.7144,1.4452,5.6928,3.5522,3.1586,3.2806,1.0726,4.3902,2.7401,1.1399,0.5115,1.8865,4.0305,0.4053,1.2475,5.4184,9.2203,4.5619,0.994,1.8807,2.1132,2.4227,0.5188,1.0408,3.5911,5.6568,3.4949,0.0599,0.6161,2.1248,3.8629,3.5333,6.0801,2.0219,1.8098,1.0091,2.9724,7.9393,2.1484,2.1648,1.147,3.7351,1.3219,4.7666,1.4649,3.2663,3.5468,0.3531,3.5819,4.2384,0.7228,1.7766,0.6628,1.0564,0.9404,2.2718,5.1849,1.1445,4.0692,2.846,3.6318,2.6634,2.0897,5.2022,1.0444,2.238,4.313,1.4379,0.6458,2.5209,0.7804,4.9367,4.7089,4.7668,3.8878,2.7894,3.4467,1.6772,4.099,2.9125,2.8958,0.2215,4.9679,0.5028,1.4492,2.4922,1.5012,2.9651,2.9184,0.1522,5.1195,2.8332,2.125,2.7373,7.5987,6.8315,3.4874,1.2136,3.6532,6.6245,0.9048,5.5932,0.2064,2.0259,3.4379,4.4306,5.6974,3.745,1.8332,4.97,1.3205,1.7075,7.5788,0.5411,7.032,0.4745,4.7049,2.4822,2.1113,0.7372,1.3329,3.2752,5.7542,3.9843,3.5564,0.865,3.9207,1.0622,1.178,6.9959,1.5835,5.5798,3.1065,1.6501,0.9574,4.0929,2.6426,4.7407,2.5185,3.9995,0.5285,1.3597,2.6315,2.7701,1.1571,5.3465,4.2943,0.0288,0.9938,8.1843,5.7905,1.854,0.7547,4.8818,1.4186,0.6899,1.5587,1.0317,4.6791,2.6975,3.5382,4.0012,3.1221,0.408,3.4126,0.6819,0.8135,0.6884,0.9889,3.3227,1.9324,1.4717,5.4143,1.4405,3.8024,0.2913,0.1916,0.3664,5.6898,1.1129,5.2801,4.9282,3.6513,1.1986,1.4091,2.975,9.5199,4.3892,0.3818,1.1937,7.6468,7.3686,5.3803,4.0023,0.4521,1.2358,3.1719,4.2798,0.8509,0.863,0.614,2.4127,0.7469]}

You have a demon as yours. This soul comes when you get old. The younger you are the better the 2nd soul is. The more you learn the devil the better the 2nd soul becomes, as a natural thing. Your main thing in life is the family. You must live with them in the same house as long as you can. You must love them. Your 2nd soul is more important than anything else in this world. When you have your 2nd soul to care for it can seem you have lost everything else in the world. Not to mention that you cannot use the magic, or do anything like flying, or jumping to very high places. All we can say is this, you have lost many, many people in this world. The people that you truly love. All of them, those that you care for like your life. Most would say this is the hardest part of being a witch. Love is what gets people to fight for you. What gets them to defend your right to be a witch, what makes a witch stand up and say no more. When you lose your loved ones to the demons, you must live your life as if you will never see them again. You feel your life is empty, and you feel like a nothing. I myself have lived through such struggles. The only way to fight is through love. Through love of people, the world, and you. You cannot defeat these forces by you yourself. They can fight you in the end, they can lose to you, they can turn against you, but they can never win. Your only hope is love of people. This is the only hope that makes us stay focused, and keep going when life is hard. I hope this helps you and all who read this.","token_len":396,"entropy":[4.7924,2.1967,8.7421,2.2837,9.5638,1.8548,4.3322,4.0856,4.9856,4.3037,2.6348,5.9917,3.4028,1.4737,7.8526,0.0747,0.974,4.4413,9.444,2.6937,0.438,0.5622,6.6043,2.2557,1.9609,11.208,1.3552,6.6628,0.4584,1.9765,2.3119,2.7091,3.6368,1.8783,2.8503,0.0128,0.5286,0.6762,3.5952,2.5067,2.1246,6.1634,3.5272,6.3738,1.5583,4.0647,3.8381,5.0826,4.4171,0.5081,3.9013,5.9006,1.8797,2.9502,6.539,0.7489,1.0624,2.1735,2.0907,3.2956,3.5867,0.0078,0.0944,2.2999,0.4993,2.5217,2.6419,1.7184,3.3943,2.2287,6.623,4.3493,0.5811,1.2438,0.5798,0.0004,0.0509,1.7479,3.4545,3.8123,4.4476,6.9343,5.5672,0.5804,4.5964,5.584,4.4852,3.5128,0.385,0.1368,3.8947,5.1931,1.3571,2.0623,4.0367,4.1969,1.5804,2.507,3.9206,1.8788,2.9556,2.2267,1.1776,6.37,0.0152,0.9216,1.8212,1.0237,2.1478,1.4091,3.7267,0.3208,2.015,3.1873,3.9993,0.012,0.4022,0.9283,4.8365,0.6524,0.4991,3.5453,0.4254,1.3676,3.7284,0.4193,0.3547,4.0496,0.544,2.5474,2.6199,0.576,0.0033,0.0691,5.2929,4.6028,0.0786,4.1479,5.0536,7.0981,6.9172,2.0476,2.8944,3.121,5.3079,2.4453,1.8693,0.3659,0.3067,5.9282,2.4523,0.2484,2.1928,1.2443,3.5647,4.085,2.3082,4.4502,3.9012,3.3967,4.6999,0.5388,4.8075,9.1967,1.6391,1.9063,5.3653,3.6657,7.6997,0.3291,0.6345,0.5025,4.2046,6.4065,1.2338,4.5502,0.2397,3.2202,2.0699,2.1585,1.775,2.313,6.649,4.9707,0.11,2.1418,1.928,0.7503,0.1857,0.4049,2.8764,4.0446,2.2939,1.5476,6.6106,1.2553,3.2311,4.2537,1.8882,0.8659,3.0509,5.224,0.8206,1.2117,3.2058,0.9164,4.7401,2.1386,4.2684,0.9005,5.5088,6.0118,0.9493,3.2417,0.902,1.7181,3.5397,1.2935,0.5888,2.9193,0.6038,4.7075,0.5722,7.5507,1.3067,3.6194,4.9937,2.6072,1.0105,5.5603,2.1539,0.7805,0.5907,4.8653,3.2213,1.7999,0.0832,5.714,3.2416,4.6862,0.1482,2.968,1.6865,0.2837,2.6555,4.0613,1.8717,3.8904,1.1322,4.0363,0.3517,2.6478,2.4596,2.9286,3.7836,0.7924,3.9934,0.5847,2.8247,1.0432,7.113,0.1848,2.9633,2.0111,4.2403,1.1368,1.4404,4.2534,4.3721,3.8624,0.2959,2.1285,2.0893,1.1662,5.2533,0.7546,2.2697,0.4739,0.0337,0.1617,1.9558,7.5613,3.6155,1.8698,1.3983,6.3667,1.6533,1.5743,1.0923,2.0657,1.5968,3.1123,6.7258,0.7528,4.6391,6.7525,1.5885,4.4287,2.9322,5.2049,5.564,1.0803,3.0063,2.7839,2.5339,0.8851,4.9046,2.9028,3.3523,1.483,0.3798,6.9934,1.7273,4.2064,2.9062,1.8742,3.9767,3.8728,0.9957,0.4278,4.416,0.3146,2.4064,3.2853,4.7316,4.307,4.5958,3.6429,5.6789,5.7133,0.351,4.73,2.7793,5.1029,1.0447,3.3996,1.7488,4.2096,1.6349,4.1951,0.3746,6.2171,4.3259,0.532,1.5983,1.8507,0.1528,4.6574,1.7086,0.0381,0.9628,2.0422,1.3494,1.1615,1.233,2.1148,0.9883,4.0423,2.9306,1.198,0.3376,3.1057,2.0619,1.0819,0.7069,3.5424,0.5261,1.4027,1.7778,2.9655,1.7738,5.1155,4.8104,6.3896,5.7664,2.2522,1.5836,2.9505,2.618,5.4541,4.2581,1.6468,2.6038,0.4019,2.9092,3.6955,2.5425,2.1716,0.7927,3.8582,4.716,4.0723,5.1825,0.2217,1.0801]}

At first , it 's seen as a blessing , but as the world adapts to it , the most sinister implications of this fact begin to unfold .","text":"In the future, children have stopped being able to die until they reach 25 years old. No one knows why. At first, it's seen as a blessing, but as the world adapts to it, the most sinister implications of this fact begin to unfold. The film follows the adventures of four little kids as they are forced to face their fears and problems as they grow up in, an unusual, world where death is unknown.\nI have always heard good things of this actor. What happened today was not good for him, he did nothing to deserve so much pain. At least, the police did their part, although it may not be enough to clear his name. There is no doubt that he lost what he had in his career, but as far as his family is concerned, he's lucky that it's over in that way.\nThis new film is based on true events that happened in India. I just found the plot interesting. The fact that the film is set in modern Kolkata makes the film relatable. The two leads do a good job, although I felt the character of the mother played by Paridhi Sahni was a little overdone. This film looks promising, although it would be hard for it to make it big screen audiences.\nA movie that would be good if the writer had put her heart into it from the start. Sadly, this movie never made it past the idea stage.\nI really liked this movie. It had some great ideas and the script was very fresh. The acting is good, with special kudos for Shalini Pandey as a young student at a women's institute in Delhi. The movie is a great example of how to produce a good film in India.\nAn award-winning actress plays two different characters, although she's the same person. The story is an unusual one and she really brings everything to the table. I would recommend it, although it does leave some unanswered questions.","token_len":396,"entropy":[2.6222,4.5009,0.2783,8.0855,5.0983,8.7011,2.5567,2.3959,0.0041,6.9993,6.3399,0.8195,2.5461,6.3607,2.0686,0.7569,0.7326,6.2284,1.0295,1.925,2.4561,1.24,5.7658,3.5875,0.415,2.1093,1.9499,7.1939,0.0612,0.8426,5.2275,1.2829,0.6928,2.5566,1.6226,4.0927,8.1366,0.0019,0.7809,2.9662,0.1782,2.0756,7.3689,7.7091,5.3511,1.7265,1.9624,5.8368,3.5049,0.0437,3.8748,0.1796,3.0414,5.8928,3.8099,1.7939,4.826,0.042,4.0708,4.9642,3.7522,2.8473,0.0515,3.8929,2.0513,0.1999,2.7477,1.9925,2.4498,1.156,4.4326,2.4513,0.5401,1.5572,0.4215,2.2374,7.7954,5.958,5.5468,2.7956,4.0844,2.0288,4.0724,0.8661,7.0443,0.846,1.3377,9.8765,3.096,3.4708,5.8774,6.8137,0.2183,6.9687,2.8909,10.4148,1.4041,5.3257,5.8067,8.3511,2.846,3.1444,2.9158,1.3207,1.8046,1.4216,4.0126,4.2804,4.189,2.1227,2.1392,6.4018,0.2232,4.799,0.8311,5.1715,2.5234,1.8343,4.116,8.7073,2.9953,6.0892,3.7686,2.2389,5.2915,2.225,3.5924,1.3642,1.2993,4.351,0.661,5.3496,1.6032,0.0415,0.4387,4.4241,1.1872,1.8907,2.7798,0.7261,1.7491,6.0335,5.9312,1.1363,1.8733,3.7098,1.288,7.2854,1.1936,1.2337,4.0965,3.5298,0.0065,2.5797,3.4636,1.2158,0.0008,0.2476,1.3295,2.3309,5.5437,2.4884,3.0239,1.8886,3.4204,5.064,4.8515,3.9094,0.1741,1.6138,3.3915,5.363,1.7816,1.2786,3.6834,0.1709,6.4159,1.7676,2.7167,1.4519,1.4229,5.1785,1.8473,2.7534,5.3292,4.46,2.794,5.9454,2.0989,1.219,2.021,4.603,0.1197,1.6641,1.5245,1.3679,2.8899,0.3084,5.1396,8.3843,0.1415,0.0,3.5159,2.1468,1.8253,8.1427,0.0011,1.5951,1.7405,6.0986,6.6647,5.0545,2.2156,1.1594,0.027,2.418,4.167,1.9704,4.7276,2.337,4.3932,2.367,1.5914,5.5819,5.0394,1.5876,6.109,6.0681,6.0941,7.8926,2.7722,1.6229,1.6951,1.2336,4.8211,0.0392,0.5621,3.7099,2.0648,5.7995,6.2365,1.2078,4.0337,1.5328,3.9427,0.7447,3.4725,2.7302,3.8067,0.0984,3.2361,1.083,5.1259,6.0668,9.6964,0.7074,1.2573,4.1674,5.4256,1.802,3.8326,1.7198,4.0664,2.717,3.3835,5.4507,2.3794,6.1076,6.3008,4.5607,1.411,0.4468,7.5691,0.5571,1.045,0.791,6.5259,0.2334,2.3946,2.6453,4.9325,2.2109,0.287,3.9591,0.6742,9.5336,0.6887,0.5547,2.589,2.4795,4.0504,2.6929,1.4275,1.9297,0.7377,1.4561,3.4807,2.5587,2.3383,3.2228,1.5924,3.523,4.6456,0.879,2.4179,5.3099,0.6683,1.6543,4.5209,2.1876,2.6034,0.8968,4.123,8.6702,10.2658,1.0067,2.4375,9.5754,1.2389,5.4104,0.7174,4.0201,3.0706,2.8081,6.0229,3.9819,2.2411,6.8099,0.125,3.6856,2.1706,3.0928,0.3872,1.459,3.6597,1.7639,2.1519,3.0326,3.1601,0.0506,1.5441,1.5828,5.4727,1.0803,2.6589,2.1142,2.7685,1.748,0.5266,1.1893,5.5535,5.2533,1.0367,0.0274,4.0949,3.5032,4.821,3.9293,1.5449,1.7276,7.3986,2.5706,2.6173,3.6254,3.7029,3.0619,0.8183,1.8068,3.2976,1.0471,5.1104,5.5365,0.0657,2.8403,3.8052,4.7738,3.4097,5.8717,0.763,0.5153,1.7893,0.446,2.4687,3.4384,2.1037,2.9661,3.7544,4.8251,1.3969,4.0014,4.7235,1.9013,4.8684,0.0346,0.3504]}
{"prompt":"Take your most epic gaming moment ( any game ) , and write it in a dramatized version .","text":"Take your most epic gaming moment ( any game ), and write it in a dramatized version. I call this type of entry a \u201c Gameplay Story\u201d. It is a story that relates \u201c who, where, and why \u201c of your most epic gaming moment. It is an interesting form of writing, because it is written within the universe of the game and as such is engaging.\nThis type of written work also has the potential to be viewed and used for promotional purposes within the game. For example you can write a piece for a game magazine or website that features your own gameplay story, and use this as your promotional piece on Steam, on your website, or the like. It can make for an interesting blog post, or blog review. It can also be used as an interview piece.\nYou might decide to \u201c hack \u201c( or steal from ) a game, or create a game based on a hack. The most famous example of this being The Evil Surge. Another example is Gone Home. Many people make the mistake of using a hack as part of their own game creation process. Do not do this. First it does not give a writer credibility, and the hack authors will try to have you or the people who use the hack \u201cpay \u201c for your game development efforts.\nMost games these days are \u201c online games \u201c. A lot of them will have forums, blogs, and chat rooms in which you could share your ideas. If you like to play Minecraft, there are a lot of people who do share their gaming ideas and thoughts on Minecraft Forums. If you like to play RPGs there are blogs such as that are a forum for RPGing and general discussion on RPGs. If you like to play online games there are many websites and community forums where you could give feedback about your experience. You would have to search for game-specific social interaction sites before deciding to use certain communication websites or forums.","token_len":396,"entropy":[5.4769,7.7754,7.4285,5.4024,4.0447,5.4096,11.5606,2.5022,5.2674,1.6513,6.33,1.3499,2.6513,2.1582,11.7777,0.2881,0.7222,4.5885,1.5557,4.0277,5.719,1.1531,5.259,0.0331,8.0634,3.5341,12.0078,6.254,9.3121,3.0921,5.7237,6.2753,8.2893,1.3558,2.9627,1.7384,1.5832,2.5348,1.5556,6.2255,8.866,0.2366,7.0985,4.0162,2.2245,0.1809,1.1859,2.6155,2.6594,0.0124,3.7862,2.3369,5.2671,0.2995,0.4404,0.9035,0.7234,2.2269,0.476,2.9673,5.3041,5.1636,0.0545,3.3447,1.8256,2.4534,0.7242,1.6216,4.5844,5.3587,0.9408,6.8012,0.3304,2.075,1.2945,2.8065,4.8357,0.9522,1.5959,6.766,1.2669,1.6941,6.8481,2.7107,0.0099,6.8068,3.3315,4.6965,2.2445,2.1567,2.0615,0.1385,1.479,6.2511,5.3373,3.5808,3.0607,6.3549,0.3423,5.1066,0.9364,1.7494,1.6509,2.2809,0.2771,5.9449,1.2363,2.4016,1.0974,4.139,2.5735,1.2851,1.6665,4.4336,1.4606,3.5243,2.1257,4.2085,2.0275,5.6017,4.689,4.3697,1.5429,1.7826,3.2128,1.6209,2.1123,2.6725,1.3721,2.4148,4.2666,3.8434,2.7111,4.9395,1.9158,1.7301,0.2911,0.8449,5.5055,4.022,0.1395,3.1431,2.0803,5.5302,3.8562,2.1714,0.5986,4.886,0.6292,1.2662,1.7122,3.9818,8.5469,2.0307,2.5426,0.5996,1.2502,0.741,0.3179,1.0698,1.5505,4.1002,2.4508,1.9945,1.1409,3.2122,3.0075,5.4037,0.4339,12.5704,0.2,10.8926,4.398,0.0072,9.5619,5.7139,6.7457,4.3211,1.2548,2.3851,0.6469,2.1723,1.4894,4.0023,0.8246,1.9425,3.5725,0.2349,2.0349,5.534,1.8678,3.0076,4.0755,4.0249,1.0179,0.5857,0.6632,5.8124,3.8167,5.0418,16.8463,2.1531,5.9354,1.5388,0.9339,7.8421,0.0661,0.7951,4.9318,1.916,4.4037,2.3194,3.0586,0.0954,2.9881,1.8552,2.1917,2.2426,3.898,0.0032,0.4782,3.7055,1.647,4.2029,2.1468,0.8748,6.8142,1.6311,2.2334,0.7041,0.6966,6.5528,4.5997,5.6193,0.1862,5.3903,2.7933,8.7174,5.9183,0.9744,1.104,3.8647,4.4071,9.0797,1.9607,4.0876,0.23,6.1056,1.5677,6.9934,2.7751,5.8937,1.6982,3.6996,1.6558,1.9988,10.8321,0.1611,11.0186,6.6991,0.0103,4.1639,1.5657,3.0578,5.0295,3.3964,0.2984,1.4898,5.2014,2.1432,7.2476,0.0073,1.0085,5.4182,0.0276,8.0463,2.5839,2.5873,0.008,2.3109,4.3987,1.8122,0.0518,2.2765,4.8997,2.2028,7.6611,2.0099,3.5452,0.0883,1.1717,4.6588,0.4235,4.4986,0.6221,0.9891,5.1189,3.1406,0.1895,3.7435,2.1099,3.2484,0.3397,4.043,1.9542,3.0977,7.0417,0.7283,4.361,0.6689,2.4038,0.4611,0.0221,3.6645,0.8433,3.628,5.1604,1.0075,6.2987,2.2954,2.2026,7.0726,1.9129,4.4871,7.2779,0.4807,2.767,0.1584,1.7265,0.6348,0.949,5.2142,6.0449,0.234,7.7613,4.5057,0.0017,6.7734,7.548,3.8133,7.8876,0.4031,2.9169,7.997,1.5318,5.6548,2.2721,2.216,1.5066,0.407,2.5627,0.0813,0.5585,0.3548,0.7583,4.8291,0.5819,1.3716,0.1488,3.3331,4.3876,2.4568,5.0501,1.5354,2.6496,0.3387,2.1196,5.4125,1.8869,3.2616,0.7897,4.8064,1.4767,3.1256,4.186,2.9244,0.847,6.2722,1.0689,6.1435,4.3268,1.6231,6.2275,6.3605,1.8827,4.6372,5.5198,0.7961,2.1643,6.975,8.3267,6.8152,3.3803,1.5032,0.2695]}
{"prompt":"Write a character who is vilified for his most Nobel act or loved for his most evil deed .","text":"Write a character who is vilified for his most Nobel act or loved for his most evil deed. A novelist who is an intellectual who wants to expose corruption on a country\u2019s government and is killed for the book he is about to write; a man who is a professor who loves, is passionate about his science and is a bit arrogant, he is also a bit arrogant, then in the end he dies of a heart attack and his body burns in his lab and then his wife and children think his brain can be transplanted into one of his research partners, so that the next generation will be like him.\nWhy would anyone want to have a heart transplant without first asking why they have a heart? That is why a heart transplant operation shouldn\u2019t be the only answer. A heart transplant shouldn\u2019t be there to be the answer for people who don\u2019t have the right answers.\nA heart transplant should be a secondary means, not its main means for dealing with this. If it\u2019s the end solution, why build a hospital specifically to do transplants?\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I hate those who want transplants, I just think they shouldn\u2019t be the sole answer.\nWe need to see what they are as people, they may be good people like people who kill for love and passion for scientific research or maybe they are evil or they\u2019re just plain stupid.\nThe problem with us now is that we take these things very personally. We just don\u2019t understand how they are just humans who live a life as they see it.\nIf this is true, then why are we doing it? We\u2019re doing what we need to do, but why? Does it really matter why if we\u2019re going to do it?\nI see it as the final option, the only option if the rest of them all fail you in their attempts to help you.","token_len":397,"entropy":[4.0641,6.1151,7.2523,1.529,12.3721,0.0471,2.1904,1.8072,8.6468,14.9837,12.4951,3.8891,8.775,2.4549,0.52,0.5538,7.9592,3.3212,0.9148,4.3251,6.7939,2.2536,2.5541,5.2438,4.4269,2.5963,4.9516,0.2461,6.2974,5.0603,4.5428,2.1502,6.6591,15.0901,7.1005,4.3901,4.4946,2.7504,4.2059,8.5356,1.5901,3.9429,5.9098,2.4389,2.9364,3.2535,0.3962,0.7192,5.7206,0.6813,3.8993,0.2252,1.5504,2.6382,6.2408,0.8556,4.5762,5.7631,3.9138,4.2782,0.4495,4.1654,5.8997,1.3036,1.7585,2.239,6.7711,5.3206,2.4302,5.7546,1.4506,3.8955,0.8072,4.7816,2.95,1.7418,6.243,4.9741,1.2925,0.8233,0.9731,3.6149,3.8324,1.7234,0.6689,0.0379,2.0521,2.965,3.3773,5.5315,2.6873,2.6266,4.0743,2.8531,3.4199,2.5168,3.9159,2.0486,0.9038,6.3497,4.1632,4.7897,4.6931,2.13,4.8276,0.0005,1.4517,4.8269,0.3846,1.4238,6.7091,7.4188,2.2582,2.8929,2.4985,2.872,3.7868,3.0398,1.8952,1.7939,3.721,0.5586,0.8029,1.3029,8.965,3.2688,2.3103,1.3786,0.1595,4.4474,1.3593,5.5421,3.5184,5.5678,5.0528,4.5531,3.6502,2.7448,2.8822,1.777,0.1986,1.0513,4.5426,1.0636,2.1894,3.8502,1.5893,0.8882,7.5437,7.0757,8.5919,0.6396,0.1782,0.2216,3.7932,1.9083,6.8259,0.6463,2.922,0.5162,0.254,4.5165,0.2517,0.0144,0.0018,0.3423,7.7662,1.5187,3.7617,2.9383,3.9223,2.9781,3.5179,0.5484,2.467,0.4217,0.1775,0.0282,1.3626,2.7857,2.8391,4.7786,0.7787,1.0497,2.9496,0.6074,0.1349,1.7984,0.6212,1.7448,9.0814,4.8824,3.7808,1.7554,6.5552,4.2823,2.8005,5.2748,5.6046,0.0082,5.2238,3.4569,3.0971,2.9804,5.2734,0.0391,0.1323,2.194,4.5613,8.7099,0.6344,2.865,8.4589,0.764,2.1908,9.326,1.2416,3.8937,7.51,0.0146,1.2005,2.208,4.5963,3.4212,2.4442,0.3385,0.1437,0.001,0.8806,3.7966,5.9936,4.4545,1.2751,2.323,5.9138,0.0079,1.8542,1.6328,1.6782,2.8017,1.5785,4.3449,0.0227,0.0099,0.0025,0.7902,2.7675,4.9836,1.852,0.5744,1.3529,5.0468,2.3302,0.67,4.325,3.1785,4.699,1.7409,5.5671,2.6171,1.5593,4.2953,5.801,1.5086,3.5887,1.2335,6.2147,5.5066,0.8393,6.8342,2.7694,4.8681,1.7895,4.8648,4.6264,4.9429,0.719,2.9723,5.5251,1.2653,0.8661,3.2803,3.1558,1.7696,4.6845,0.0122,3.5961,2.2976,3.8074,2.5402,0.9815,1.1328,3.2272,3.3899,1.0346,6.9866,5.2019,0.375,0.4655,0.9515,7.2207,3.9835,2.8148,3.8512,2.9667,1.0857,1.2229,4.9235,1.2523,0.0369,0.1517,0.0041,2.9673,1.8194,2.2117,1.978,5.5768,7.165,2.2902,4.3918,3.4284,1.4413,4.9607,2.0868,3.7524,2.838,0.8066,1.166,3.129,4.1497,1.1371,2.4478,0.8054,0.6374,1.8586,2.0018,0.6978,2.5857,2.065,0.4765,2.4163,6.2615,0.0647,0.9724,2.0574,3.7437,0.6066,3.6202,0.1585,0.1814,2.0422,2.7167,3.4731,2.8227,6.6285,1.0236,2.5971,1.0886,4.4893,6.9523,1.03,5.2536,0.043,1.3066,3.3859,0.1015,1.0857,0.9745,1.5449,0.8742,2.4841,4.7703,2.6228,1.2868,2.7845,6.2834,6.1291,1.3524,2.4037,1.6303,1.6632,5.0387,3.2388,3.353,0.0378,6.3851,5.3154,4.1032,7.1549,4.2228,1.8631,2.5366,0.4338,4.8412,1.3405,1.1032]}

You were given the honor of taking the camera to the deepest parts of the ocean for the first time. Can you tell them how the camera works? If not, do you have the opportunity to try?\nThis is an excellent example of a scientific observation made by one of our earth scientists. The camera filters out water, and therefore allows us to view the deep sea environment as if it were air.\nI was assigned the mission of taking that camera to the deepest part of the ocean. The new technology can now be used to investigate the sea floor in the Caribbean.\nThe images below show some of the remarkable sea life that we find near the seafloor. Most of the images are taken through the filters in the camera, but not all of them were. The images are a preview only.\nI took the camera to a great depth : 1,100 ft or 350 metres. This is one of the deepest places that humans have found so date. This part of the Caribbean will never be explored again (except by us).\nI spent 3 weeks at an exclusive private island in the south pacific where the fish can be seen as if they were swimming through air. This part of the ocean also shows me the vast oceans that surround the earth.\nA great image from the ocean. The camera filters out water, and therefore allows us to see the deepest parts of the ocean as if they were air. I take the camera to the deepest of the deep.\nWhat amazing images, but unfortunately it is also a very dangerous job to do. If you know the real depths you are doing and have good safety equipment of course you are in for a good time.\nThe most challenging part of the assignment was for me to come to this little island. The images show you some of the great places that I found.","token_len":397,"entropy":[6.4137,8.4193,3.109,4.5197,3.6282,2.7237,7.7883,0.6123,10.029,1.8568,2.2259,6.2801,3.7166,2.0473,4.4479,0.0368,3.2757,4.4544,2.164,3.2509,2.7383,0.2702,0.202,5.751,2.2545,5.9903,0.3155,5.8491,7.756,3.793,1.5806,10.144,0.1691,3.6383,2.4701,3.4541,2.0824,1.4221,6.7163,3.4807,0.0011,0.2987,0.9237,3.9165,1.607,0.6005,0.0062,0.736,6.9374,0.3992,2.6361,6.685,2.821,4.1892,1.2322,1.1183,0.2541,5.4069,2.2757,0.1407,4.4878,0.4135,1.3752,4.155,5.5428,0.2026,2.7622,4.145,0.958,9.8957,1.4815,2.4621,3.4174,3.6573,0.0993,1.9429,6.2502,5.6061,3.9162,0.9686,3.7174,0.2906,1.9117,8.9661,1.3864,0.7789,2.0312,1.5614,6.3064,0.4529,2.3126,2.1613,2.6952,5.1707,2.8471,1.3206,0.0685,1.9506,1.157,4.6615,2.0659,6.0658,1.7773,0.2835,0.149,0.2215,6.8585,0.4892,2.0331,3.6548,3.0892,6.3823,2.1525,3.3268,0.5686,3.5842,5.8419,1.7215,0.3703,0.6328,0.4749,1.3176,0.0029,0.0542,0.2446,1.4828,2.1391,6.7965,4.9024,4.1223,3.6604,0.4963,0.377,0.5802,5.2378,1.2472,4.3534,2.2458,3.1291,2.0834,6.3289,1.1213,1.5224,2.0895,5.6111,2.5948,1.2423,3.3063,0.3838,0.1148,5.856,4.0349,1.4107,1.2747,1.7588,3.6348,5.2029,0.6411,4.0164,0.001,0.0001,0.3391,5.5097,0.4412,0.6461,2.0659,1.1015,1.4487,5.0196,1.3436,5.0814,2.7907,0.6039,1.0985,1.1458,1.1538,5.129,0.5589,0.8887,0.4406,3.8482,4.2772,2.155,2.5863,1.4844,3.9239,5.7322,7.5739,1.6545,1.1448,2.9711,4.1755,1.6031,1.8343,0.7047,2.4338,4.9631,0.7132,10.5277,3.8619,0.8263,3.9069,3.8258,4.7117,7.162,3.7258,0.6059,2.5295,0.6937,4.2614,0.0991,0.1501,2.7665,2.9259,3.6542,5.825,0.1581,2.4936,4.0871,16.1916,2.8382,3.4729,6.0917,0.1438,0.0554,4.195,6.6989,4.0582,0.425,1.5416,1.8111,5.0453,3.0369,2.4823,5.5286,1.4436,0.8241,2.1812,4.6855,4.3557,2.4938,2.2827,4.7722,7.2092,4.6138,2.3893,1.6575,0.7439,4.7739,7.1262,0.0121,2.6064,2.1098,5.9424,4.9335,1.0784,0.7001,4.3574,1.6771,0.5881,0.3297,2.1898,1.4556,1.9538,0.2661,2.4564,4.9054,0.1979,0.0588,1.9933,5.3783,4.6692,4.5864,1.3785,5.2783,4.6594,1.7439,2.7837,1.0606,5.2574,0.4353,1.0401,4.0002,3.6922,5.0538,2.3769,1.0261,4.24,2.8152,2.1837,3.7803,2.7227,0.189,1.6392,0.9886,0.8684,1.2453,0.154,0.1532,0.0024,1.8469,0.1427,2.7921,1.1433,0.0017,0.0213,0.0928,1.2476,0.0062,2.4022,0.046,0.7265,0.0874,3.1099,5.6491,0.8611,0.2569,0.2247,1.0647,0.1775,6.2422,0.4332,3.8291,3.1658,0.9056,4.3717,7.0695,2.9234,4.4938,4.9591,5.624,3.5283,1.2383,4.7392,1.9829,1.9226,4.7191,4.3112,2.455,3.1019,0.9364,3.7263,0.4631,4.9231,2.3352,5.2234,4.2912,3.7578,2.6215,4.1746,4.9039,2.8551,4.7907,5.0278,1.2789,6.65,2.221,1.2276,2.1449,3.4239,1.9054,0.4176,3.1589,1.8641,0.2747,1.298,2.1129,4.458,4.483,0.2613,0.4719,0.9708,5.7699,0.6851,5.4183,0.8364,0.1995,5.0481,2.83,3.4462,5.4812,1.0336,2.4109,1.9908,5.3287,3.0063,3.4833,3.8081,0.7823,0.0586,3.5069,3.3466,1.0253,4.1203,1.9666,1.7476]}

{"prompt":"Aliens abduct and release humans for the same reasons that humans catch and release fish .","text":"Aliens abduct and release humans for the same reasons that humans catch and release fish. We know that, and it\u2019s a fact that needs to be acknowledged. If it weren\u2019t for it, there would be no fishing industry. That\u2019s not to say we want a total abolition of fishing; we should certainly promote sustainable fisheries that have less negative impacts on fish, its environment and on society as a whole. But we have to acknowledge that it is not a sustainable or ethical approach when humans become prey, when species like the salmon are deliberately destroyed by people who have no appreciation of nature, the very thing that makes us human.\nAnother example of human abuse is the killing of lions to provide trophies for hunters. It is a sad and heartbreaking thing but it is also not a sustainable practice and it will eventually cease. As for our predators on our food chains \u2013 who does one turn to? The question to ask here is who will take their place when we stop feeding ourselves on meat. And what about the many species that are driven to extinction? If we take this one step further, we can go down the path of becoming omnivorous in the next 50-60 years (i.e. our diet that is made up of mostly plants, meat being used only as a luxury). This may be a viable option for some people but it is definitely not for all. A big part of our human nature is to seek out a sense of normalcy. I would argue that we need to reintroduce some of the same human characteristics that have made us such a great species, even if it makes us \u2018un-evolutionary\u2019 in this day and age. Humanity has not always been like this; we have done terrible things in the past but there has also been many great human characteristics from the beginning of time \u2013 we just have to remember that the best thing we can do for our own future is to do well by our fellow beings.","token_len":399,"entropy":[9.9962,11.7187,3.8962,5.7924,5.4191,4.5771,2.6323,5.9045,2.7247,1.6777,2.7964,9.3268,1.3265,0.5916,4.3441,0.9098,4.5216,2.7178,0.9455,4.6699,4.0128,2.5953,15.1861,7.7009,2.5432,2.5634,2.7071,1.4394,9.5921,0.1884,0.0436,2.3468,0.922,4.4526,3.3353,3.4311,3.6203,0.6092,0.2942,2.1467,5.9152,0.8373,3.2714,0.4536,0.291,0.7486,6.1567,3.7534,1.6108,4.3971,3.2668,0.0206,0.248,2.5519,3.2548,0.3221,3.1012,4.7671,3.6679,8.3432,4.7417,0.0848,1.0611,4.294,1.6365,4.9426,5.1333,6.2988,4.2523,2.1143,3.2759,4.1182,5.1661,6.1166,0.4326,0.4098,2.5188,2.7258,8.7933,2.2637,0.961,5.8056,4.4992,2.8457,0.0237,0.0002,0.1674,2.6771,2.0242,3.1058,0.7693,2.5288,0.3335,3.0733,1.159,1.8223,2.5196,3.7498,6.0074,4.7857,3.1876,4.7888,6.7106,5.7018,5.2967,3.293,4.0977,6.6536,3.3916,2.5999,3.7532,2.0137,7.3215,4.989,1.7392,4.7498,1.628,3.2135,1.4593,5.6957,1.2034,5.1085,2.4751,4.7435,6.5061,3.1376,0.4371,2.0163,2.0755,1.7371,0.4965,1.227,11.0277,3.8771,0.8889,3.6866,4.6689,1.2143,1.1002,3.6673,0.1473,6.5664,5.1972,5.9286,6.5688,0.5893,5.8987,0.8105,2.9313,0.8878,2.0395,3.1328,2.4791,4.6299,3.7319,5.0263,1.6035,0.9046,1.717,3.541,1.7205,3.1125,3.8818,3.048,1.5253,4.4012,5.2847,5.7631,1.8331,4.2952,3.685,4.1213,6.8567,6.3672,1.9079,3.0643,3.1636,4.5804,4.6526,7.7149,5.5351,9.1729,1.2782,2.8942,2.4996,5.3343,5.4608,0.4096,3.6873,0.1721,4.7927,3.007,2.9491,3.3826,2.7328,4.047,1.7397,3.1597,3.3611,5.5078,4.4765,3.7304,2.2627,3.7875,2.9015,1.8307,1.2992,5.1438,4.01,1.205,1.6155,6.5197,1.1626,0.2205,2.507,3.9605,0.894,4.279,3.7995,4.3379,0.9397,0.2139,0.6837,1.1749,1.5428,5.0,4.9448,1.1501,1.585,0.1726,6.1372,4.4073,0.0028,2.1461,3.8502,1.2429,2.5268,2.6839,3.763,1.4966,0.0222,4.6457,4.8143,0.0057,0.0005,0.7942,4.9083,4.1573,6.2788,1.3916,4.6692,0.6807,0.2885,4.8227,3.383,1.5567,4.4023,8.453,5.0282,3.7005,2.4061,0.7142,6.7104,2.2281,3.517,4.5835,1.904,1.6848,5.9008,1.292,1.6532,1.6459,2.3425,1.4892,1.0803,0.9217,6.1056,0.175,1.6559,1.7654,0.6284,4.6324,4.9716,0.8702,0.0177,2.1347,5.0981,4.0757,0.4375,1.2008,4.7789,0.9617,4.1124,6.3861,0.0182,7.8827,0.1076,1.9655,4.0179,2.7522,2.4814,0.2005,2.2156,2.0046,0.2294,7.7515,0.0035,2.2783,0.5414,0.9536,3.912,4.8561,3.2235,0.7999,2.3142,2.2222,0.7509,3.2593,1.774,2.5505,1.9342,2.0616,5.0207,0.5883,1.5332,4.7948,0.9544,13.6446,6.0318,7.3435,4.0941,6.6905,1.9815,0.2923,1.0243,0.7388,5.5038,4.2019,4.2993,0.0377,0.0017,0.2067,8.0235,2.2051,3.5187,3.6279,0.5852,3.3311,0.8277,3.3061,1.6156,0.9568,5.0468,5.4593,0.017,2.5239,1.0612,0.0884,2.1692,3.9499,1.9982,3.9867,0.0614,4.0012,2.2018,3.0779,8.1471,5.8005,1.5778,2.1126,2.8809,1.6177,4.2705,3.429,4.9708,1.838,0.6736,2.8762,0.5026,3.3021,3.4092,2.635,1.3577,0.2136,0.0605,1.7534,1.5471,2.5466,3.8436,0.3014,0.6636,3.6657,3.8404,4.726,2.8423,2.8657,3.8755,0.5833]}

Trainer code dictates a battle if trainers lock eyes. What would happen if people could have an easier time doing that? A friend, a family member, and even one of those other friends who are strangers to you on the App can join your Battle! What does that mean? It means you can find new friends, or challenge your friends to a battle together in your Battle Center. You will get Battle Points which can be used to unlock items in your Battle Center.\nWhen you play Pokemon Go, be in the right place when its time for your next battle and the Pokemon you want could be just around the corner! You will have the chance to get your match on, but first you need to decide what species of Pokemon you want to fight. From the very first moment you set out to go catch Pokemon, you want to make sure you catch all the Pokemon that you could. Every time that you catch a Pokemon, it will be stored in the local storage! You can also store your Pokemon in the local storage so that you can use it as a Pokestop or a gym! As you walk around, you would be able to look at all the Pokemon that have been caught!\nThe main goal of every trainer's game is to try to get the best out of his creatures. That is why every once in a while you need to train your Pokemon to the next level. There are ways to do this. Some Pokemons will have to be able to catch Pokemon, others will need the item to be able to do it. By going into Pokemon Go on every single day, you will eventually find out exactly which pokemon you want to keep and which one you want to discard. When you are fighting, the battle will give you a chance to change the Pokemon you want to fight. You will be able to choose different Pokemon which you think give you better chances of winning.","token_len":399,"entropy":[3.8828,2.7333,8.5134,7.9994,2.9051,1.8346,1.5987,6.253,2.1574,8.9842,14.5369,8.8794,3.4412,1.5536,5.7021,4.2667,4.0156,3.7382,1.0843,7.5476,9.918,8.7802,4.0356,5.0664,6.1919,6.66,8.6322,5.1387,2.6834,5.0122,4.7009,2.2714,0.2172,6.8375,4.2381,4.9233,3.7289,3.948,0.1273,4.8157,2.7647,0.7004,4.6245,5.2474,3.9699,1.9856,3.6688,0.1419,0.5316,2.3562,2.2369,4.1654,0.7746,4.1788,4.4709,4.1017,2.6129,2.4135,6.1304,1.3447,1.2374,5.1041,0.8693,9.8557,6.0159,4.3956,2.5347,6.1348,3.6103,7.7391,3.4534,1.5023,0.7152,0.4981,2.1938,0.2379,1.4089,1.3539,5.2206,4.2808,1.3167,1.8028,4.2877,5.0535,1.862,1.3473,1.2408,1.2584,1.1685,5.7758,3.7118,3.0362,3.0661,7.6347,0.5121,3.0252,2.9793,2.994,7.5442,2.7733,3.7653,1.91,0.3162,0.6433,0.3262,2.3441,4.9111,3.4477,1.1294,1.0456,0.9371,0.7427,2.4763,11.0418,0.6008,3.1472,3.0613,1.3174,0.5688,7.3671,7.5035,1.2122,2.1288,0.6138,4.9062,7.4791,2.2157,1.964,2.9572,2.1622,1.431,4.0313,4.1161,3.44,2.4336,2.4227,6.8126,0.6748,5.0534,1.4805,0.0596,0.0041,1.9626,3.2904,2.0774,2.3658,1.8152,1.528,0.0334,3.9358,2.5204,6.8541,3.6755,3.2618,3.1226,4.575,0.9956,1.1757,0.0844,4.8194,1.8986,9.2253,1.7742,0.3905,0.459,0.2792,0.2934,2.852,0.8854,5.6118,1.8798,3.723,1.0394,3.2468,0.5121,6.2613,1.5426,1.3035,4.3642,7.03,1.4716,0.4469,0.7692,4.8201,0.2497,3.2624,0.0986,0.7906,3.8517,2.4423,1.2828,1.8904,1.6507,1.077,5.0625,2.1574,5.4765,1.4921,5.1489,0.4383,1.9258,0.6566,0.2393,0.4461,2.0825,1.1889,1.3718,4.9713,0.7041,1.9089,6.8248,3.926,6.9852,2.507,1.313,2.7602,3.2757,1.3782,1.2569,0.9127,1.4359,1.8273,1.9339,2.576,1.2444,0.6592,0.4004,2.554,1.0441,3.3096,0.879,7.9736,0.0366,0.0462,2.2538,2.6274,6.498,4.139,4.7453,1.0466,6.3408,1.7338,2.0906,0.7325,5.9808,2.2159,0.9007,0.0084,4.2839,1.1913,2.0932,0.4653,0.5393,1.5752,3.3057,0.2371,1.5196,3.6458,1.9586,3.0699,4.8102,3.4573,0.5065,5.9461,3.9921,3.8559,3.4562,0.1881,0.116,5.5338,0.6853,2.3477,1.9684,1.0265,1.8988,0.0035,5.8905,7.2174,0.8813,3.7095,1.2926,0.5949,2.5793,7.1204,0.0241,0.0933,0.0085,1.5707,3.3849,0.2101,5.6453,1.8435,0.6027,1.5217,3.4164,2.708,0.06,0.8077,3.7767,0.3151,5.3356,0.3581,1.6768,0.8533,2.4402,3.3856,6.4989,1.397,2.1317,2.685,5.1999,0.656,5.126,0.0025,3.2242,2.6935,2.5932,2.0332,0.6024,2.1118,4.509,6.287,1.744,1.8573,1.3193,0.0029,2.9646,1.977,0.4693,5.5418,4.3945,2.978,3.0386,0.3969,4.59,6.3385,3.1332,1.5943,0.4794,0.3473,1.0145,6.1299,2.4555,1.1629,3.3148,2.662,3.2904,1.2025,0.9899,0.1058,4.847,2.1111,2.4685,3.4392,0.6138,1.1491,0.0548,5.8768,0.4506,4.2339,0.3855,2.5292,5.7777,1.95,3.2059,3.4745,1.2166,6.2075,0.1057,1.5376,1.2535,0.0406,4.7274,1.6449,3.1982,1.2023,1.2884,0.4982,2.0327,1.4564,2.3206,1.5277,2.1538,0.2889,0.0083,2.4844,5.2234,1.6316,4.91,1.1226,4.7432,6.9832,0.4173,3.2893,2.1592,0.9526,1.1433,0.8008]}

Later you learn the old guy is a cancer survivor whose mother was killed in a car accident 20 years ago. You look around, unable to find anyone higher than a 1.00. You feel stupid.\nIn a parallel universe the same people are now around your age and all have a degree in computer security. The old guy has a 4.5 ( highest you ve seen ) : he is your father and his mother was stabbed to death this morning. You wonder what did you do wrong. Now you can understand why people always ask questions when they hear that the mother of your dad is dead.\nAll kinds of stories can develop if you try out this metaphor, I will give you two more examples next week.\nThis morning I walked to the office and got to the trainstation when it sounded like an earthquake in the office - it was my friend, a very strong person ( who can still climb a wall even when his house was destroyed 20 years ago ) from my childhood - from his window he could see a tree branch on fire as it cracked.\nI sat on the train to work - there was only a small fire out on the canal, but my friend told me that it had burned down many houses in the neighborhood.\nBy the time I got to work my phone was ringing non-stop every ten minutes. I quickly checked my message - I had just been invited to dinner and the weather was fantastic.\nSo the question for you people is, how do you react when things start to happen that appear to have a logical explanation? Do you stop, and think? Do you let it go and try to remember what had happened before?","token_len":399,"entropy":[4.7924,2.1967,5.2785,10.7964,3.2431,2.6283,2.5221,7.7282,1.8655,8.55,1.1387,4.4111,2.2728,4.8479,0.8486,12.2947,2.0949,7.9323,3.9143,4.5307,2.0805,4.4676,4.2426,6.8775,2.2886,3.6916,5.4134,14.2448,4.9807,0.1523,3.2286,4.1627,0.7554,0.0021,1.1747,3.9677,8.079,6.4578,1.5149,1.8801,1.0679,8.0658,3.86,7.3323,0.1833,8.7546,10.2403,3.8445,7.5961,3.1633,3.539,8.8777,8.9047,1.2015,2.7045,5.9639,9.6025,4.679,0.0015,2.132,4.7677,6.2358,3.9144,4.981,2.3665,4.5803,3.1047,6.9311,5.3545,1.6848,2.1082,8.7705,0.5832,5.2818,3.7694,1.9638,2.8455,1.5685,0.8606,0.9234,0.4688,6.2552,0.0501,0.105,0.5859,1.7946,4.8995,2.1275,2.3327,7.8999,0.015,2.0924,2.6,9.5661,1.9459,3.0822,3.22,1.0927,4.6983,1.1171,1.7258,4.3203,6.5076,1.912,2.2062,5.5259,2.9272,6.4365,0.6004,4.0207,3.8932,3.5235,1.9431,5.3121,5.4672,3.608,2.4748,1.9235,5.2198,4.2436,2.0419,5.803,1.3292,4.5451,6.9594,0.6929,2.7484,4.5828,1.0829,2.5343,1.4725,5.7299,0.7476,2.4271,5.1499,9.0724,3.9894,14.3891,2.116,1.2791,10.7826,4.5609,2.0122,5.1091,3.603,1.8667,2.8074,2.0119,1.8628,6.4931,1.2048,0.0029,6.9769,1.9364,0.8764,1.5473,4.6611,1.689,6.5313,1.8707,0.6787,2.3989,1.0564,5.5617,0.6655,3.1793,4.4148,1.0812,3.1749,5.1646,3.3156,3.8863,3.4597,0.9781,4.7709,3.2865,2.6768,6.658,1.4192,1.5353,3.9036,1.2867,2.1586,0.4238,1.465,5.5373,6.8437,0.0182,4.6721,3.9171,6.8254,4.7531,0.6034,3.9918,5.8236,3.1533,8.0958,2.9042,5.4521,3.1243,3.1849,0.5069,3.1705,4.8645,0.9279,9.1422,2.198,0.5814,0.9434,3.9254,4.3038,1.6423,4.412,2.5188,1.0831,4.6761,2.0259,4.0664,2.971,2.7319,8.6934,7.1452,5.4293,3.3217,6.504,0.4761,3.6569,3.7961,4.8669,1.0704,5.3639,6.964,2.828,0.6147,6.0525,4.4964,2.6108,3.1489,4.7208,4.7413,3.7057,4.2252,4.8837,4.6754,4.7674,6.7764,2.8803,2.4032,5.2385,2.685,3.7467,7.2506,3.7494,2.6779,7.6333,0.0639,0.0436,1.4832,4.1472,3.9482,4.4174,4.5094,5.4678,3.2885,9.7995,5.0686,3.2232,0.5434,2.5069,5.3954,3.778,3.3518,3.785,4.5505,2.0896,5.5761,1.8152,2.4565,1.66,4.3567,2.4612,0.4946,2.3822,4.4118,2.7221,4.1505,3.9439,0.4966,3.6154,2.013,2.7686,3.4658,5.65,3.025,0.1662,8.5176,2.1552,2.4199,3.741,0.5965,5.1097,0.0717,1.7237,2.1683,2.4954,3.3601,1.2289,5.4151,3.1573,1.7579,0.833,3.8466,1.0482,1.9862,5.7013,0.9188,0.3633,0.5247,0.7057,0.8658,1.7688,3.1993,6.0109,1.6547,1.255,7.7126,2.5773,0.0048,5.787,5.0454,0.1331,1.0893,1.1768,5.3561,3.9547,1.2698,5.5951,2.4174,2.082,1.6669,2.5816,2.2666,5.3849,0.3292,4.1968,2.7351,3.3889,6.527,0.3808,6.3337,0.9158,1.2165,4.337,3.5586,4.6332,4.4562,1.9309,5.6965,0.9423,1.6367,2.0962,1.3114,0.215,4.6426,1.2053,5.4273,3.1631,0.8515,4.547,2.0192,7.956,0.7196,2.7419,2.6966,6.4677,2.5565,1.2679,3.9289,0.0722,4.8268,4.2304,2.9003,2.8186,3.6681,1.6935,0.0318,4.3946,1.6553,0.6904,1.7528,3.0061,0.6113,4.5332,1.4755,4.4254,0.1612,4.023,1.0596]}

Now he has to ask you a riddle, and you're not crossing his bridge until you solve it. You might ask him, \" Where are you going? \" It would be a bridge troll answer, \" to bridge over to the other side. \" Then you have to ask, \" What is your name? \" His answer might be, \" Bridge troll \". Now the troll is not a person, just a creature, and he is just a bridge troll. But the question may be interesting enough to you, that you try to imagine, \" My name is... \" and your answer might be, \" Bridge troll. \" Your own imaginary name and Bridge troll.\nIf you want to know more about how you might help build bridges to the future it has been suggested that you read a book called The Power of Thinking Big by Daniel Goleman.\n2. To learn where you are from you may look at your family tree - to learn what kind of life happened to your ancestors and how they changed. Then you could imagine your future. If only you knew how you might change in the future - and you can, of course. To do this, you should think about what you feel and think about your self in the future. Think about how you would be.\nI think, if you try it, that you will find it interesting and rewarding to think about your future. It might surprise you how far you can go - if you are willing to think about it\nDo you ever think about your life going forward? There might be a time when you are not sure why you are alive anymore, and your future has no sense, but that's not always the case. Our lives have a purpose - to learn what you can do to help others, to make life meaningful for others, and to find the joy in existence. You can do that if you are willing to.","token_len":399,"entropy":[5.176,9.4697,6.4077,3.4556,0.4617,10.4931,1.776,8.9532,7.4616,5.1203,1.1138,2.9802,3.0969,2.4709,2.5001,1.1243,5.8339,5.9818,2.8438,3.7208,5.2065,0.2897,2.436,6.9511,0.1092,1.997,1.5129,1.1509,3.3845,2.8271,10.4457,3.4892,0.4753,4.0137,0.6224,5.5219,0.9838,0.4337,2.3239,4.6264,4.1001,1.0313,2.6793,0.5869,7.9722,1.6814,0.4642,0.9846,2.6812,0.858,4.6563,3.5671,0.6789,2.1277,7.0688,1.4958,6.1496,1.2065,4.2259,4.3002,5.9033,5.3485,1.9638,1.1535,2.1949,0.206,1.2376,3.2029,5.2113,1.0643,3.5551,0.1548,2.436,2.9039,0.0618,1.6893,1.7302,1.5657,1.4004,1.0081,0.2079,4.6065,0.7177,3.1568,0.4243,2.0595,0.068,7.3851,1.8809,5.117,3.4582,3.085,1.303,2.0515,3.748,2.8508,3.8999,1.0377,3.5227,0.5543,3.4322,2.0199,1.2883,1.8407,2.1415,4.3392,1.1842,2.3678,0.2043,0.552,3.7333,2.6078,3.8851,4.7515,0.9345,5.4028,2.8432,1.1649,2.8808,1.237,2.7689,0.5227,4.6683,0.5648,5.797,4.4933,2.4932,5.7541,0.0818,0.0773,4.9396,0.9739,2.0422,4.9657,1.9076,1.1353,0.2143,0.7517,0.0563,2.404,0.1085,2.9687,0.6334,5.0863,5.3397,8.9452,1.8528,4.0629,7.3912,0.0655,2.0934,2.5585,8.2452,0.2714,3.736,0.2579,3.1068,1.3906,0.2784,3.113,2.5247,3.4903,5.6153,5.499,0.8599,4.3847,2.1595,4.929,7.2228,5.4674,1.3988,0.7354,0.5968,0.572,5.0148,3.2678,0.7715,1.2887,2.0583,6.5102,0.2339,4.9083,9.1402,2.5417,5.3543,5.8248,1.8363,0.1755,1.0609,2.6163,7.499,0.5386,5.5269,4.6461,5.5173,1.3645,1.7284,3.4037,2.884,2.9499,4.4521,1.4372,2.6859,3.6832,1.0001,5.1019,4.6914,2.4921,2.8192,2.9504,0.016,4.9013,8.203,0.9035,1.9213,2.9061,3.1136,2.4431,0.9062,3.5481,1.842,4.8605,0.7621,3.5725,5.4799,2.5419,3.435,2.4957,3.5094,5.7867,0.5903,2.1345,2.0989,2.2168,2.2421,3.3567,4.5953,1.6088,0.2374,3.921,2.507,1.965,3.7819,3.5128,3.7685,0.0077,2.3402,5.6984,2.7619,0.8087,1.6045,0.3844,3.2719,3.2857,0.7401,2.0129,1.2033,5.9415,3.2703,2.2974,0.707,1.9608,6.315,3.569,1.1585,0.7059,0.5044,4.4996,0.2972,1.9834,0.4439,2.3724,2.9431,4.9337,2.1821,5.5309,3.0088,4.4179,3.4028,0.8972,5.0233,4.9105,0.893,2.1314,0.7956,1.3452,2.9077,2.7478,2.5554,1.9976,4.7476,2.6184,2.4448,0.3156,1.666,1.3992,0.9982,2.9461,2.2154,5.4978,0.0697,3.3531,3.6344,0.3995,1.6748,0.7269,4.1129,3.3787,0.3789,2.9232,3.8307,0.044,2.3218,0.5596,1.4626,7.4897,5.3141,0.9334,3.569,1.9434,0.4476,1.5969,2.8966,5.73,1.9425,0.5069,5.6056,3.0508,0.1817,1.3849,1.3118,0.7597,0.3447,1.955,2.6289,1.7053,4.9894,0.4057,0.8047,6.6902,3.9813,1.3741,1.7858,3.4785,2.6021,4.0534,3.8418,5.7428,3.1505,1.5618,3.1591,2.3838,2.0744,4.4692,0.6204,0.0657,0.3017,7.8276,2.1586,2.3136,2.4899,4.1582,2.1753,1.9649,4.2578,2.6194,4.1315,2.9503,0.7361,1.0396,1.5597,2.2277,1.6326,1.3179,2.6279,3.5013,4.5707,1.3839,0.8492,0.8624,1.137,0.3835,4.194,2.8475,4.1605,1.2991,7.29,0.6249,3.7167,2.2761,2.3332,1.8319,3.6492,0.0953,1.8747,1.0134,0.042,4.8854]}
