Question: Are UK radiologists satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse? Answer: The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training
Question: Does preoperative anemia adversely affect colon and rectal surgery outcomes? Answer: This large multicenter database analysis suggests that the presence of severe and moderate and even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for complications and a longer hospital stay after colon surgery.
Question: Does septoplasty change the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate? Answer: The present study findings suggest that compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is not affected by septoplasty, even after one year.
Question: Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce disability in the elderly? Answer: Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range
Question: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome? Answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may
Question: A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction? Answer: The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.
Question: Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently? Answer: Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.
Question: The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for insulin resistance? Answer: We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.
Question: The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones? Answer: The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.
Question: Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT? Answer: PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some anatomic locations, its results are
Question: Does the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meet the principles of universal coverage? Answer: The principles of universal coverage require that all should benefit from health care according to need. The Kenyan health sector is clearly inequitable and benefits are not distributed on the basis of need. Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system
Question: Does cognitive function predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition? Answer: The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had
Question: Preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: is it a prognostic factor? Answer: Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (×10(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.
Question: Long-term significance of postictal psychotic episodes II. Are they predictive of interictal psychotic episodes? Answer: A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.
Question: Are Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover Representative of Bone Histomorphometry in 370 Postmenopausal Women? Answer: Bone turnover markers were significantly but modestly associated with bone turnover parameters measured in iliac cancellous bone. The iliac crest bone may not
Question: Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine surgery effective? Answer: Lumbar drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases of large dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF leaks.
Question: Impact of MPH programs: contributing to health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries? Answer: There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the national level. Much of the impact described was in line with public health educational aims. The qualitative method study revealed more in-depth understanding of graduates' impact as
Question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy? Answer: LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for the treatment of brain tumors.
Question: Do episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli? Answer: In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these
Question: Visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level: can it represent visceral adipose tissue volume? Answer: VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above
Question: Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites? Answer: Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.
Question: Is there a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women? Answer: In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.
Question: Is there a role for fondaparinux in perioperative bridging? Answer: The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its use as a routine bridging agent.
Question: Do African American women require fewer calories to maintain weight? Answer: These results do not support the view that AA women are at greater risk for obesity because they require fewer calories to maintain weight.
Question: Is crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales? Answer: Our findings demonstrate that OTC pharmacy syringe sales were not associated with increases in reported crime in local communities in Los Angeles during 2006-2008.
Question: Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes associated with improved outcomes? Answer: People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.
